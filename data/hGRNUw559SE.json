aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue.\n\n00:09.480 --> 00:15.320\n He is interested in understanding how we humans can be the best version of ourselves as individuals\n\n00:15.320 --> 00:19.000\n and as collectives at all scales.\n\n00:19.000 --> 00:24.920\n Quick mention of our sponsors, Ground News, NetSuite, Four Sigmatic, Magic Spoon, and\n\n00:24.920 --> 00:25.920\n BetterHelp.\n\n00:25.920 --> 00:29.560\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:29.560 --> 00:33.760\n As a side note, let me say that I got a chance to talk to Daniel on and off the mic for a\n\n00:33.760 --> 00:34.760\n couple of days.\n\n00:34.760 --> 00:37.920\n We took a long walk the day before our conversation.\n\n00:37.920 --> 00:40.800\n I really enjoyed meeting him, just on a basic human level.\n\n00:40.800 --> 00:46.600\n We talked about the world around us with words that carried hope for us individual ants actually\n\n00:46.600 --> 00:50.120\n contributing something of value to the colony.\n\n00:50.120 --> 00:55.040\n These conversations are the reasons I love human beings, our insatiable striving to lessen\n\n00:55.040 --> 00:56.780\n the suffering in the world.\n\n00:56.780 --> 01:01.680\n But more than that, there's a simple magic to two strangers meeting for the first time\n\n01:01.680 --> 01:06.180\n and sharing ideas, becoming fast friends, and creating something that is far greater\n\n01:06.180 --> 01:07.880\n than the sum of our parts.\n\n01:07.880 --> 01:12.400\n I've gotten to experience some of that same magic here in Austin with a few new friends\n\n01:12.400 --> 01:16.240\n and in random bars in my travels across this country.\n\n01:16.240 --> 01:21.000\n Where a conversation leaves me with a big stupid smile on my face and a new appreciation\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:24.420\n of this too short, too beautiful life.\n\n01:24.420 --> 01:31.220\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger.\n\n01:31.220 --> 01:37.520\n If aliens were observing Earth through the entire history, just watching us, and we're\n\n01:37.520 --> 01:41.320\n tasked with summarizing what happened until now, what do you think they would say?\n\n01:41.320 --> 01:43.480\n What do you think they would write up in that summary?\n\n01:43.480 --> 01:47.080\n Like it has to be pretty short, less than a page.\n\n01:47.080 --> 01:54.120\n Like in Hitchhiker's Guide, there's I think like a paragraph or a couple sentences.\n\n01:54.120 --> 01:58.560\n How would you summarize, sorry, how would the aliens summarize, do you think, all of\n\n01:58.560 --> 02:00.920\n human civilization?\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:04.520\n My first thoughts take more than a page.\n\n02:04.520 --> 02:06.840\n They'd probably distill it.\n\n02:06.840 --> 02:12.420\n Because if they watched, well, I mean, first, I have no idea if their senses are even attuned\n\n02:12.420 --> 02:16.960\n to similar stuff to what our senses are attuned to, or what the nature of their consciousness\n\n02:16.960 --> 02:19.000\n is like relative to ours.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:22.480\n So let's assume that they're kind of like us, just technologically more advanced to\n\n02:22.480 --> 02:24.040\n get here from wherever they are.\n\n02:24.040 --> 02:27.400\n That's the first kind of constraint on the thought experiment.\n\n02:27.400 --> 02:32.760\n And then if they've watched throughout all of history, they saw the burning of Alexandria.\n\n02:32.760 --> 02:38.960\n They saw that 2,000 years ago in Greece, we were producing things like clocks, the antikytheria\n\n02:38.960 --> 02:40.880\n mechanism, and then that technology got lost.\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:45.000\n They saw that there wasn't just a steady dialectic of progress.\n\n02:45.000 --> 02:49.280\n So every once in a while, there's a giant fire that destroys a lot of things.\n\n02:49.280 --> 02:54.280\n There's a giant commotion that destroys a lot of things.\n\n02:54.280 --> 02:58.520\n Yeah, and it's usually self induced.\n\n02:58.520 --> 03:00.840\n They would have seen that.\n\n03:00.840 --> 03:07.400\n And so as they're looking at us now, as we move past the nuclear weapons age into the\n\n03:07.400 --> 03:15.100\n full globalization, anthropocene, exponential tech age, still making our decisions relatively\n\n03:15.100 --> 03:21.200\n similarly to how we did in the stone age as far as rivalry game theory type stuff, I think\n\n03:21.200 --> 03:24.840\n they would think that this is probably most likely one of the planets that is not going\n\n03:24.840 --> 03:28.040\n to make it to being intergalactic because we blow ourselves up in the technological\n\n03:28.040 --> 03:29.600\n adolescence.\n\n03:29.600 --> 03:37.220\n And if we are going to, we're going to need some major progress rapidly in the social\n\n03:37.220 --> 03:43.660\n technologies that can guide and bind and direct the physical technologies so that we are safe\n\n03:43.660 --> 03:46.200\n vessels for the amount of power we're getting.\n\n03:46.200 --> 03:55.920\n Actually, Hitchhiker's Guide has an estimation about how much of a risk this particular thing\n\n03:55.920 --> 03:57.640\n poses to the rest of the galaxy.\n\n03:57.640 --> 04:03.560\n And I think, I forget what it was, I think it was medium or low.\n\n04:03.560 --> 04:08.940\n So their estimation was, would be that this species of ant like creatures is not going\n\n04:08.940 --> 04:10.400\n to survive long.\n\n04:10.400 --> 04:13.960\n There's ups and downs in terms of technological innovation.\n\n04:13.960 --> 04:18.520\n The fundamental nature of their behavior from a game theory perspective hasn't really changed.\n\n04:18.520 --> 04:26.660\n They have not learned in any fundamental way how to control and properly incentivize or\n\n04:26.660 --> 04:32.760\n properly do the mechanism design of games to ensure long term survival.\n\n04:32.760 --> 04:35.720\n And then they move on to another planet.\n\n04:35.720 --> 04:43.440\n Do you think there is, in a slightly more serious question, do you think there's some\n\n04:43.440 --> 04:50.560\n number or perhaps a very, very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there?\n\n04:50.560 --> 04:54.000\n Yes, would be hard to think otherwise.\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:58.920\n I know, I think Bostrom had a new article not that long ago on why that might not be\n\n04:58.920 --> 05:04.020\n the case, that the Drake equation might not be the kind of end story on it.\n\n05:04.020 --> 05:09.640\n But when I look at the total number of Kepler planets just that we're aware of just galactically\n\n05:09.640 --> 05:16.460\n and also like when those life forms were discovered in Mono Lake that didn't have the same six\n\n05:16.460 --> 05:21.360\n primary atoms, I think it had arsenic replacing phosphorus as one of the primary aspects of\n\n05:21.360 --> 05:26.400\n its energy metabolism, we get to think about that the building blocks might be more different.\n\n05:26.400 --> 05:30.760\n So the physical constraints even that the planets have to have might be more different.\n\n05:30.760 --> 05:37.400\n It seems really unlikely not to mention interesting things that we've observed that are still\n\n05:37.400 --> 05:38.400\n unexplained.\n\n05:38.400 --> 05:44.320\n As you had guests on your show discussing Tic Tac and all the ones that have visited.\n\n05:44.320 --> 05:45.320\n Yeah.\n\n05:45.320 --> 05:46.560\n Well, let's dive right into that.\n\n05:46.560 --> 05:56.480\n What do you make sense of the rich human psychology of there being hundreds of thousands, probably\n\n05:56.480 --> 06:02.880\n millions of witnesses of UFOs of different kinds on Earth, most of which I presume are\n\n06:02.880 --> 06:07.520\n conjured up by the human mind through the perception system.\n\n06:07.520 --> 06:12.760\n Some number might be true, some number might be reflective of actual physical objects,\n\n06:12.760 --> 06:21.080\n whether it's you know, drones or testing military technology that secret or otherworldly technology.\n\n06:21.080 --> 06:26.760\n What do you make sense of all of that, because it's gained quite a bit of popularity recently.\n\n06:26.760 --> 06:37.040\n There's some sense in which that's us humans being hopeful and dreaming of otherworldly\n\n06:37.040 --> 06:44.480\n creatures as a way to escape the dreariness of our of the human condition.\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:49.480\n But in another sense, it could be it really could be something truly exciting that science\n\n06:49.480 --> 06:53.640\n should turn its eye towards.\n\n06:53.640 --> 06:56.320\n So what do you where do you place it?\n\n06:56.320 --> 07:00.960\n Speaking of turning eye towards this is one of those super fascinating, actually super\n\n07:00.960 --> 07:05.720\n consequential possibly topics that I wish I had more time to study and just haven't\n\n07:05.720 --> 07:09.000\n allocated so I don't have firm beliefs on this because I haven't got to study it as\n\n07:09.000 --> 07:10.000\n much as I want.\n\n07:10.000 --> 07:15.480\n So what I'm going to say comes from a superficial assessment.\n\n07:15.480 --> 07:20.280\n While we know there are plenty of things that people thought of as UFO sightings that we\n\n07:20.280 --> 07:24.400\n can fully write off, we have other better explanations for them.\n\n07:24.400 --> 07:27.200\n What we're interested in is the ones that we don't have better explanations for and\n\n07:27.200 --> 07:33.080\n then not just immediately jumping to a theory of what it is, but holding it as unidentified\n\n07:33.080 --> 07:36.560\n and being being curious and earnest.\n\n07:36.560 --> 07:42.360\n I think the the tic tac one is quite interesting and made it in major media recently.\n\n07:42.360 --> 07:49.120\n But I don't know if you ever saw the Disclosure Project, a guy named Steven Greer organized\n\n07:49.120 --> 07:57.520\n a bunch of mostly US military and some commercial flight people who had direct observation and\n\n07:57.520 --> 08:02.100\n classified information disclosing it at a CNN briefing.\n\n08:02.100 --> 08:07.480\n And so you saw high ranking generals, admirals, fighter pilots all describing things that\n\n08:07.480 --> 08:17.600\n they saw on radar with their own eyes or cameras, and also describing some phenomena that had\n\n08:17.600 --> 08:20.560\n some consistency across different people.\n\n08:20.560 --> 08:27.320\n And I find this interesting enough that I think it would be silly to just dismiss it.\n\n08:27.320 --> 08:32.000\n And specifically, we can ask the question, how much of it is natural phenomena, ball\n\n08:32.000 --> 08:34.440\n lightning or something like that?\n\n08:34.440 --> 08:39.360\n And this is why I'm more interested in what fighter pilots and astronauts and people who\n\n08:39.360 --> 08:48.960\n are trained in being able to identify flying objects and atmospheric phenomena have to\n\n08:48.960 --> 08:51.560\n say about it.\n\n08:51.560 --> 08:57.240\n I think the thing then you could say, well, are they more advanced military craft?\n\n08:57.240 --> 09:00.120\n Is it some kind of, you know, human craft?\n\n09:00.120 --> 09:03.920\n The interesting thing that a number of them describe is something that's kind of like\n\n09:03.920 --> 09:09.260\n right angles at speed, or not right angles, acute angles at speed, but something that\n\n09:09.260 --> 09:14.600\n looks like a different relationship to inertia than physics makes sense for us.\n\n09:14.600 --> 09:20.880\n I don't think that there are any human technologies that are doing that even in really deep underground\n\n09:20.880 --> 09:22.360\n black projects.\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:25.760\n Now one could say, okay, well, could it be a hologram?\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:28.240\n Or would it show up on radar if radar is also seeing it?\n\n09:28.240 --> 09:30.760\n And so I don't know.\n\n09:30.760 --> 09:37.440\n I think there's enough, I mean, and for that to be a massive coordinated psyop, is it as\n\n09:37.440 --> 09:45.200\n interesting and ridiculous in a way as the idea that it's UFOs from some extra planetary\n\n09:45.200 --> 09:46.200\n source?\n\n09:46.200 --> 09:49.340\n So it's up there on the interesting topics.\n\n09:49.340 --> 09:57.540\n To me there's, if it is at all alien technology, it is the dumbest version of alien technology.\n\n09:57.540 --> 10:03.040\n It's so far away, it's like the old, old crappy VHS tapes of alien technology.\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:08.240\n These are like crappy drones that just floated or even like space to the level of like space\n\n10:08.240 --> 10:14.280\n junk because it is so close to our human technology.\n\n10:14.280 --> 10:19.400\n We talk about it moves in ways that's unlike what we understand about physics, but it still\n\n10:19.400 --> 10:26.960\n has very similar kind of geometric notions and something that we humans can perceive\n\n10:26.960 --> 10:28.480\n with our eyes, all those kinds of things.\n\n10:28.480 --> 10:34.800\n I feel like alien technology most likely would be something that we would not be able to\n\n10:34.800 --> 10:35.800\n perceive.\n\n10:35.800 --> 10:43.200\n Not because they're hiding, but because it's so far advanced that it would be beyond the\n\n10:43.200 --> 10:45.280\n cognitive capabilities of us humans.\n\n10:45.280 --> 10:53.440\n Just as you were saying, as per your answer for alien summarizing Earth, the starting\n\n10:53.440 --> 10:59.200\n assumption is they have similar perception systems, they have similar cognitive capabilities,\n\n10:59.200 --> 11:01.400\n and that very well may not be the case.\n\n11:01.400 --> 11:08.320\n Let me ask you about staying in aliens for just a little longer because I think it's\n\n11:08.320 --> 11:14.440\n a good transition in talking about governments and human societies.\n\n11:14.440 --> 11:24.600\n Do you think if a US government or any government was in possession of an alien spacecraft or\n\n11:24.600 --> 11:34.220\n of information related to alien spacecraft, they would have the capacity, structurally\n\n11:34.220 --> 11:45.040\n would they have the processes, would they be able to communicate that to the public\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:50.840\n effectively or would they keep it secret in a room and do nothing with it, both to try\n\n11:50.840 --> 11:58.400\n to preserve military secrets, but also because of the incompetence that's inherent to bureaucracies\n\n11:58.400 --> 12:00.240\n or either?\n\n12:00.240 --> 12:08.400\n Well, we can certainly see when certain things become declassified 25 or 50 years later that\n\n12:08.400 --> 12:13.000\n there were things that the public might have wanted to know that were kept secret for a\n\n12:13.000 --> 12:20.600\n very long time for reasons of at least supposedly national security, which is also a nice source\n\n12:20.600 --> 12:27.940\n of plausible deniability for people covering their ass for doing things that would be problematic\n\n12:27.940 --> 12:34.260\n and other purposes.\n\n12:34.260 --> 12:42.600\n There are, there's a scientist at Stanford who supposedly got some material that was\n\n12:42.600 --> 12:48.640\n recovered from Area 51 type area, did analysis on it using, I believe, electron microscopy\n\n12:48.640 --> 12:56.520\n and a couple other methods and came to the idea that it was a nanotech alloy that was\n\n12:56.520 --> 13:00.320\n something we didn't currently have the ability to do, was not naturally occurring.\n\n13:00.320 --> 13:05.040\n So there, I've heard some things and again, like I said, I'm not going to stand behind\n\n13:05.040 --> 13:13.140\n any of these because I haven't done the level of study to have high confidence.\n\n13:13.140 --> 13:19.480\n I think what you said also about would it be super low tech alien craft, like would\n\n13:19.480 --> 13:24.240\n they necessarily move their atoms around in space or might they do something more interesting\n\n13:24.240 --> 13:30.160\n than that, might they be able to have a different relationship to the concept of space or information\n\n13:30.160 --> 13:36.880\n or consciousness or one of the things that the craft supposedly do is not only accelerate\n\n13:36.880 --> 13:40.580\n and turn in a way that looks non inertial, but also disappear.\n\n13:40.580 --> 13:45.240\n So there's a question as to like the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive and it\n\n13:45.240 --> 13:51.400\n could be possible to, some people run a hypothesis that they create intentional amounts of exposure\n\n13:51.400 --> 13:58.800\n as an invitation of a particular kind, who knows, interesting field.\n\n13:58.800 --> 14:05.400\n We tend to assume like SETI that's listening out for aliens out there, I've just been\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:13.360\n recently reading more and more about gravitational waves and you have orbiting black holes that\n\n14:13.360 --> 14:20.880\n orbit each other, they generate ripples in space time on my, for fun at night when I\n\n14:20.880 --> 14:25.960\n lay in bed, I think about what it would be like to ride those waves when they, not the\n\n14:25.960 --> 14:30.600\n low magnitude they are when they reach earth, but get closer to the black holes because\n\n14:30.600 --> 14:38.000\n it will basically be shrinking and expanding us in all dimensions, including time.\n\n14:38.000 --> 14:43.040\n So it's actually ripples through space time that they generate.\n\n14:43.040 --> 14:51.960\n Why is it that you couldn't use that, it travels the speed of light, travels at a speed which\n\n14:51.960 --> 15:00.200\n is a very weird thing to say when you're morphing space time, you could argue it's faster than\n\n15:00.200 --> 15:02.200\n the speed of light.\n\n15:02.200 --> 15:08.720\n So if you're able to communicate by, to summon enough energy to generate black holes and\n\n15:08.720 --> 15:16.960\n to orbit them, to force them to orbit each other, why not travel as the ripples in space\n\n15:16.960 --> 15:21.040\n time, whatever the hell that means, somehow combined with wormholes.\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:26.840\n So if you're able to communicate through, like we don't think of gravitational waves\n\n15:26.840 --> 15:33.420\n as something you can communicate with because the radio will have to be a very large size\n\n15:33.420 --> 15:39.360\n and very dense, but perhaps that's it, perhaps that's one way to communicate, it's a very\n\n15:39.360 --> 15:41.040\n effective way.\n\n15:41.040 --> 15:47.640\n And that would explain, like we wouldn't even be able to make sense of that, of the physics\n\n15:47.640 --> 15:53.320\n that results in an alien species that's able to control gravity at that scale.\n\n15:53.320 --> 15:57.880\n I think you just jumped up the Kardashev scale so far that you're not just harnessing the\n\n15:57.880 --> 16:05.840\n power of a star, but harnessing the power of mutually rotating black holes.\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:13.600\n That's way above my physics pay grade to think about including even non rotating black hole\n\n16:13.600 --> 16:17.040\n versions of transwarp travel.\n\n16:17.040 --> 16:22.600\n I think, you know, you can talk with Eric more about that, I think he has better ideas\n\n16:22.600 --> 16:23.920\n on it than I do.\n\n16:23.920 --> 16:30.000\n My hope for the future of humanity mostly does not rest in the near term on our ability\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:33.140\n to get to other habitable planets in time.\n\n16:33.140 --> 16:39.400\n And even more than that, in the list of possible solutions of how to improve human civilization,\n\n16:39.400 --> 16:43.080\n orbiting black holes is not on the first page for you.\n\n16:43.080 --> 16:44.080\n Not on the first page.\n\n16:44.080 --> 16:45.080\n Okay.\n\n16:45.080 --> 16:49.840\n I bet you did not expect us to start this conversation here, but I'm glad the places\n\n16:49.840 --> 16:52.640\n it went.\n\n16:52.640 --> 17:02.600\n I am excited on a much smaller scale of Mars, Europa, Titan, Venus, potentially having very\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:11.560\n like bacteria like life forms, just on a small human level, it's a little bit scary, but\n\n17:11.560 --> 17:19.120\n mostly really exciting that there might be life elsewhere in the volcanoes and the oceans\n\n17:19.120 --> 17:25.240\n all around us, teaming, having little societies and whether there's properties about that\n\n17:25.240 --> 17:28.320\n kind of life that's somehow different than ours.\n\n17:28.320 --> 17:35.320\n I don't know what would be more exciting if those colonies of single cell type organisms,\n\n17:35.320 --> 17:39.360\n what would be more exciting if they're different or they're the same?\n\n17:39.360 --> 17:47.080\n If they're the same, that means through the rest of the universe, there's life forms like\n\n17:47.080 --> 17:51.320\n us, something like us everywhere.\n\n17:51.320 --> 17:57.160\n If they're different, that's also really exciting because there's life forms everywhere that\n\n17:57.160 --> 18:00.440\n are not like us.\n\n18:00.440 --> 18:01.440\n That's a little bit scary.\n\n18:01.440 --> 18:04.640\n I don't know what's scarier actually.\n\n18:04.640 --> 18:08.600\n I think both scary and exciting no matter what, right?\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:11.560\n The idea that they could be very different is philosophically very interesting for us\n\n18:11.560 --> 18:17.640\n to open our aperture on what life and consciousness and self replicating possibilities could look\n\n18:17.640 --> 18:19.760\n like.\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:22.560\n The question on are they different or the same, obviously there's lots of life here\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:26.840\n that is the same in some ways and different in other ways.\n\n18:26.840 --> 18:30.520\n When you take the thing that we call an invasive species is something that's still pretty the\n\n18:30.520 --> 18:36.360\n same hydrocarbon based thing, but co evolved with co selective pressures in a certain environment,\n\n18:36.360 --> 18:39.720\n we move it to another environment, it might be devastating to that whole ecosystem because\n\n18:39.720 --> 18:44.960\n it's just different enough that it messes up the self stabilizing dynamics of that ecosystem.\n\n18:44.960 --> 18:52.600\n So the question of are they, would they be different in ways where we could still figure\n\n18:52.600 --> 18:59.280\n out a way to inhabit a biosphere together or fundamentally not fundamentally the nature\n\n18:59.280 --> 19:04.240\n of how they operate and the nature of how we operate would be incommensurable is a deep\n\n19:04.240 --> 19:05.240\n question.\n\n19:05.240 --> 19:10.000\n Well, we offline talked about mimetic theory, right?\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:15.600\n It seems like if there were sufficiently different where we would not even, we can coexist on\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:19.620\n different planes, it seems like a good thing.\n\n19:19.620 --> 19:24.400\n If we're close enough together to where we'd be competing, then it's, you're getting into\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:30.040\n the world of viruses and pathogens and all those kinds of things to where we would, one\n\n19:30.040 --> 19:40.160\n of us would die off quickly through basically mass murder without even accidentally.\n\n19:40.160 --> 19:48.560\n If we just had a self replicating single celled kind of creature that happened to not work\n\n19:48.560 --> 19:53.720\n well for the hydrocarbon life that was here that got introduced because he either output\n\n19:53.720 --> 19:57.520\n something that was toxic or utilized up the same resource too quickly and it just replicated\n\n19:57.520 --> 20:04.440\n faster and mutated faster, that it wouldn't be a mimetic theory, conflict theory kind\n\n20:04.440 --> 20:05.440\n of harm.\n\n20:05.440 --> 20:11.200\n It would just be a Von Neumann machine, a self replicating machine that was fundamentally\n\n20:11.200 --> 20:16.280\n incompatible with these kinds of self replicating systems with faster OODA loops.\n\n20:16.280 --> 20:24.280\n For one final time, putting your alien God hat on and you look at human civilization,\n\n20:24.280 --> 20:30.840\n do you think about the 7.8 billion people on earth as individual little creatures, individual\n\n20:30.840 --> 20:41.760\n little organisms, or do you think of us as one organism with a collective intelligence?\n\n20:41.760 --> 20:46.600\n What's the proper framework through which to analyze it again as an alien?\n\n20:46.600 --> 20:50.640\n So that I know where you're coming from, would you have asked the question the same way before\n\n20:50.640 --> 20:54.080\n the industrial revolution, before the agricultural revolution when there were half a billion\n\n20:54.080 --> 20:59.220\n people and no telecommunications connecting them?\n\n20:59.220 --> 21:09.000\n I would indeed ask the question the same way, but I would be less confident about your conclusions.\n\n21:09.000 --> 21:12.840\n It would be an actually more interesting way to ask the question at that time, but I was\n\n21:12.840 --> 21:14.520\n nevertheless asked it the same way.\n\n21:14.520 --> 21:15.520\n Yes.\n\n21:15.520 --> 21:20.480\n Well, let's go back further and smaller than rather than just a single human or the entire\n\n21:20.480 --> 21:27.480\n human species, let's look at a relatively isolated tribe.\n\n21:27.480 --> 21:34.600\n In the relatively isolated, probably sub Dunbar number, sub 150 people tribe, do I look at\n\n21:34.600 --> 21:40.400\n that as one entity where evolution is selecting for based on group selection or do I think\n\n21:40.400 --> 21:45.800\n of it as 150 individuals that are interacting in some way?\n\n21:45.800 --> 21:49.840\n Well, could those individuals exist without the group?\n\n21:49.840 --> 21:52.480\n No.\n\n21:52.480 --> 22:00.920\n The evolutionary adaptiveness of humans was involved critically group selection and individual\n\n22:00.920 --> 22:06.760\n humans alone trying to figure out stone tools and protection and whatever aren't what was\n\n22:06.760 --> 22:09.040\n selected for.\n\n22:09.040 --> 22:13.560\n And so I think the or is the wrong frame.\n\n22:13.560 --> 22:20.280\n I think it's individuals are affecting the group that they're a part of.\n\n22:20.280 --> 22:25.280\n They're also dependent upon and being affected by the group that they're part of.\n\n22:25.280 --> 22:31.080\n And so this now starts to get deep into political theories also, which is theories that orient\n\n22:31.080 --> 22:35.280\n towards the collective at different scales, whether a tribal scale or an empire or a nation\n\n22:35.280 --> 22:40.100\n state or something, and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and stuff like that.\n\n22:40.100 --> 22:43.420\n And I think there's very obvious failure modes on both sides.\n\n22:43.420 --> 22:47.040\n And so the relationship between them is more interesting to me than either of them.\n\n22:47.040 --> 22:49.840\n The relationship between the individual and the collective and the question around how\n\n22:49.840 --> 22:52.080\n to have a virtuous process between those.\n\n22:52.080 --> 22:57.480\n So a good social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism\n\n22:57.480 --> 23:02.000\n of the group of individuals is they're both synergistic to each other.\n\n23:02.000 --> 23:05.760\n So what is best for the individuals and what's best for the whole is aligned.\n\n23:05.760 --> 23:08.960\n But there is nevertheless an individual.\n\n23:08.960 --> 23:21.240\n They're not, it's a matter of degrees, I suppose, but what defines a human more, the social\n\n23:21.240 --> 23:26.480\n network within which they've been brought up, through which they've developed their\n\n23:26.480 --> 23:33.040\n intelligence or is it their own sovereign individual self?\n\n23:33.040 --> 23:40.040\n What's your intuition of how much, not just for evolutionary survival, but as intellectual\n\n23:40.040 --> 23:44.040\n beings, how much do we need others for our development?\n\n23:44.040 --> 23:45.040\n Yeah.\n\n23:45.040 --> 23:51.800\n I think we have a weird sense of this today relative to most previous periods of sapient\n\n23:51.800 --> 23:53.280\n history.\n\n23:53.280 --> 23:59.880\n I think the vast majority of sapient history is tribal, like depending upon your early\n\n23:59.880 --> 24:06.760\n human model, 200,000 or 300,000 years of homo sapiens and little tribes, where they depended\n\n24:06.760 --> 24:12.760\n upon that tribe for survival and excommunication from the tribe was fatal.\n\n24:12.760 --> 24:17.320\n I think they, and our whole evolutionary genetic history is in that environment and the amount\n\n24:17.320 --> 24:20.880\n of time we've been out of it is relatively so tiny.\n\n24:20.880 --> 24:27.040\n And then we still depended upon extended families and local communities more and the big kind\n\n24:27.040 --> 24:33.200\n of giant market complex where I can provide something to the market to get money, to be\n\n24:33.200 --> 24:35.960\n able to get other things from the market where it seems like I don't need anyone.\n\n24:35.960 --> 24:42.200\n It's almost like disintermediating our sense of need, even though you're in my ability\n\n24:42.200 --> 24:46.500\n to talk to each other using these mics and the phones that we coordinated on took millions\n\n24:46.500 --> 24:50.080\n of people over six continents to be able to run the supply chains that made all the stuff\n\n24:50.080 --> 24:52.360\n that we depend on, but we don't notice that we depend upon them.\n\n24:52.360 --> 24:56.080\n They all seem fungible.\n\n24:56.080 --> 25:00.320\n If you take a baby, obviously that you didn't even get to a baby without a mom.\n\n25:00.320 --> 25:01.320\n Was it dependent?\n\n25:01.320 --> 25:05.440\n Are we dependent upon each other, right, without two parents at minimum and they depended upon\n\n25:05.440 --> 25:06.440\n other people.\n\n25:06.440 --> 25:11.400\n But if we take that baby and we put it out in the wild, it obviously dies.\n\n25:11.400 --> 25:14.700\n So if we let it grow up for a little while, the minimum amount of time where it starts\n\n25:14.700 --> 25:19.260\n to have some autonomy and then we put it out in the wild, and this has happened a few times,\n\n25:19.260 --> 25:27.760\n it doesn't learn language and it doesn't learn the small motor articulation that we learn.\n\n25:27.760 --> 25:34.420\n It doesn't learn the type of consciousness that we end up having that is socialized.\n\n25:34.420 --> 25:41.260\n So I think we take for granted how much conditioning affects us.\n\n25:41.260 --> 25:49.960\n Is it possible that it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole thing?\n\n25:49.960 --> 25:56.280\n The whole thing is the connection between us humans and that we're no better than apes\n\n25:56.280 --> 25:59.080\n without our human connections.\n\n25:59.080 --> 26:05.400\n Because thinking of it that way forces us to think very differently about human society\n\n26:05.400 --> 26:09.800\n and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental.\n\n26:09.800 --> 26:14.060\n I just have to object to the no better than apes, because better here I think you mean\n\n26:14.060 --> 26:17.480\n a specific thing, which means have capacities that are fundamentally different than.\n\n26:17.480 --> 26:21.920\n I think apes also depend upon troops.\n\n26:21.920 --> 26:29.200\n And I think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of ethical sense ends\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:30.360\n up having heaps of problems.\n\n26:30.360 --> 26:31.360\n We'll table that.\n\n26:31.360 --> 26:32.600\n We can come back to it.\n\n26:32.600 --> 26:36.500\n But when we say what is unique about Homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:41.460\n we currently inhabit the biosphere with, and I'm saying it that way because there were\n\n26:41.460 --> 26:47.820\n other early hominids that had some of these capacities, we believe.\n\n26:47.820 --> 26:52.020\n Our tool creation and our language creation and our coordination are all kind of the results\n\n26:52.020 --> 26:56.320\n of a certain type of capacity for abstraction.\n\n26:56.320 --> 26:59.760\n And other animals will use tools, but they don't evolve the tools they use.\n\n26:59.760 --> 27:03.380\n They keep using the same types of tools that they basically can find.\n\n27:03.380 --> 27:08.200\n So a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine that it wants to, and it'll even notice\n\n27:08.200 --> 27:10.160\n that a sharper rock will cut it better.\n\n27:10.160 --> 27:12.480\n And experientially it'll use the sharper rock.\n\n27:12.480 --> 27:15.640\n And if you even give it a knife, it'll probably use the knife because it's experiencing the\n\n27:15.640 --> 27:16.640\n effectiveness.\n\n27:16.640 --> 27:22.240\n But it doesn't make stone tools because that requires understanding why one is sharper\n\n27:22.240 --> 27:23.240\n than the other.\n\n27:23.240 --> 27:28.280\n What is the abstract principle called sharpness to then be able to invent a sharper thing?\n\n27:28.280 --> 27:34.060\n That same abstraction makes language and the ability for abstract representation, which\n\n27:34.060 --> 27:38.960\n makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways.\n\n27:38.960 --> 27:43.360\n So I do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:46.520\n of what we are as a species.\n\n27:46.520 --> 27:51.120\n I wonder if that coordination, that connection is actually the thing that gives birth to\n\n27:51.120 --> 27:56.080\n consciousness, that gives birth to, well, let's start with self awareness.\n\n27:56.080 --> 27:57.080\n More like theory of mind.\n\n27:57.080 --> 27:58.080\n Theory of mind.\n\n27:58.080 --> 27:59.080\n Yeah.\n\n27:59.080 --> 28:03.640\n You know, I suppose there's experiments that show that there's other mammals that have\n\n28:03.640 --> 28:05.640\n a very crude theory of mind.\n\n28:05.640 --> 28:06.640\n Not sure.\n\n28:06.640 --> 28:08.360\n Maybe dogs, something like that.\n\n28:08.360 --> 28:12.520\n But actually dogs probably has to do with that they co evolved with humans.\n\n28:12.520 --> 28:18.920\n See it'd be interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the\n\n28:18.920 --> 28:21.040\n way we think about it.\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:24.880\n Is the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness.\n\n28:24.880 --> 28:31.440\n I have an inkling sense that that only exists because we're social creatures.\n\n28:31.440 --> 28:36.600\n That doesn't come with the hardware and the software in the beginning.\n\n28:36.600 --> 28:45.120\n That's learned as an effective tool for communication almost.\n\n28:45.120 --> 28:49.200\n I think we think that consciousness is fundamental.\n\n28:49.200 --> 28:58.520\n And maybe it's not, there's a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that the illusion\n\n28:58.520 --> 29:00.720\n of consciousness is consciousness.\n\n29:00.720 --> 29:08.440\n That it is just a facade we use to help us construct theories of mind.\n\n29:08.440 --> 29:12.120\n You almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being.\n\n29:12.120 --> 29:18.000\n And that experience, you want to richly experience it as an individual person so that I could\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:20.800\n empathize with your experience.\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:22.760\n I find that notion compelling.\n\n29:22.760 --> 29:29.000\n Mostly because it allows you to then create robots that become conscious not by being\n\n29:29.000 --> 29:37.840\n quote unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till they make it.\n\n29:37.840 --> 29:44.400\n Present a facade of consciousness with the task of making that facade very convincing\n\n29:44.400 --> 29:48.240\n to us humans and thereby it will become conscious.\n\n29:48.240 --> 29:55.440\n Have a sense that in some way that will make them conscious if they're sufficiently convincing\n\n29:55.440 --> 29:58.880\n to humans.\n\n29:58.880 --> 30:05.260\n Is there some element of that that you find convincing?\n\n30:05.260 --> 30:11.960\n This is a much harder set of questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the\n\n30:11.960 --> 30:15.040\n aliens was.\n\n30:15.040 --> 30:18.060\n We went from aliens to consciousness.\n\n30:18.060 --> 30:24.140\n This is not the trajectory I was expecting nor you, but let us walk a while.\n\n30:24.140 --> 30:27.100\n We can walk a while and I don't think we will do it justice.\n\n30:27.100 --> 30:34.320\n So what do we mean by consciousness versus conscious self reflective awareness?\n\n30:34.320 --> 30:38.200\n What do we mean by awareness, qualia, theory of mind?\n\n30:38.200 --> 30:45.040\n There's a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and subjectivity,\n\n30:45.040 --> 30:46.040\n first person.\n\n30:46.040 --> 30:53.200\n I don't remember exactly the quote, but I remember when reading when Sam Harris wrote\n\n30:53.200 --> 30:57.780\n the book Free Will and then Dennett critiqued it and then there was some writing back and\n\n30:57.780 --> 31:05.380\n forth between the two because normally they're on the same side of kind of arguing for critical\n\n31:05.380 --> 31:11.240\n thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against supernatural ideas.\n\n31:11.240 --> 31:15.680\n And here Dennett believed there is something like free will.\n\n31:15.680 --> 31:21.600\n He is a determinist compatibilist, but no consciousness and a radical element of this.\n\n31:21.600 --> 31:24.340\n And Sam was saying, no, there is consciousness, but there's no free will.\n\n31:24.340 --> 31:29.040\n And that's like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they disagreed on, but\n\n31:29.040 --> 31:31.240\n neither of them could say it was because the other one didn't understand the philosophy\n\n31:31.240 --> 31:34.220\n of science or logical fallacies.\n\n31:34.220 --> 31:37.160\n And they kind of spoke past each other and at the end, if I remember correctly, Sam said\n\n31:37.160 --> 31:42.360\n something that I thought was quite insightful, which was to the effect of it seems, because\n\n31:42.360 --> 31:46.120\n they weren't making any progress in shared understanding, it seems that we simply have\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:49.100\n different intuitions about this.\n\n31:49.100 --> 31:56.240\n And what you could see was that what the words meant, right at the level of symbol grounding,\n\n31:56.240 --> 31:59.360\n might be quite different.\n\n31:59.360 --> 32:03.480\n One of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being\n\n32:03.480 --> 32:06.700\n referenced and then also different associations of what the words mean.\n\n32:06.700 --> 32:11.760\n This is why when trying to address these things, Charles Sanders Peirce said the first philosophy\n\n32:11.760 --> 32:16.600\n has to be semiotics, because if you don't get semiotics right, we end up importing different\n\n32:16.600 --> 32:20.320\n ideas and bad ideas right into the nature of the language that we're using.\n\n32:20.320 --> 32:22.920\n And then it's very hard to do epistemology or ontology together.\n\n32:22.920 --> 32:28.280\n So, I'm saying this to say why I don't think we're going to get very far is I think we\n\n32:28.280 --> 32:33.960\n would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental concepts.\n\n32:33.960 --> 32:40.960\n Well, and also allowing our minds to drift together for a time so that our definitions\n\n32:40.960 --> 32:42.800\n of these terms align.\n\n32:42.800 --> 32:51.360\n I think there's some, there's a beauty that some people enjoy with Sam that he is quite\n\n32:51.360 --> 32:59.600\n stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing that definition.\n\n32:59.600 --> 33:06.440\n So in his mind, he can sense that he can deeply understand what he means exactly by a term\n\n33:06.440 --> 33:08.200\n like free will and consciousness.\n\n33:08.200 --> 33:15.860\n And you're right, he's very specific in fascinating ways that not only does he think that free\n\n33:15.860 --> 33:23.360\n will is an illusion, he thinks he's able, not thinks, he says he's able to just remove\n\n33:23.360 --> 33:30.000\n himself from the experience of free will and just be like for minutes at a time, hours\n\n33:30.000 --> 33:38.480\n at a time, like really experience as if he has no free will, like he's a leaf flowing\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:41.320\n down the river.\n\n33:41.320 --> 33:45.880\n And given that, he's very sure that consciousness is fundamental.\n\n33:45.880 --> 33:53.280\n So here's this conscious leaf that's subjectively experiencing the floating and yet has no ability\n\n33:53.280 --> 33:56.760\n to control and make any decisions for itself.\n\n33:56.760 --> 34:02.440\n It's only a, the decisions have all been made.\n\n34:02.440 --> 34:06.560\n There's some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps is the problem.\n\n34:06.560 --> 34:11.320\n So that's a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the Vedantic\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:15.680\n tradition and some of the Buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described similar experiences\n\n34:15.680 --> 34:19.480\n and somewhat similar conclusions, some slightly different.\n\n34:19.480 --> 34:27.240\n There are other types of phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure\n\n34:27.240 --> 34:33.720\n agency and, you know, like the Catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist Teilhard de Chardin\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:39.640\n describes this and that rather than a creator agent God in the beginning, there's a creative\n\n34:39.640 --> 34:44.280\n impulse or a creative process and he would go into a type of meditation that identified\n\n34:44.280 --> 34:49.360\n as the pure essence of that kind of creative process.\n\n34:49.360 --> 34:55.560\n And I think the types of experience we've had and then one, the types of experience\n\n34:55.560 --> 34:58.640\n we've had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol grounding.\n\n34:58.640 --> 35:03.040\n The other thing is the types of experiences we have can't not be interpreted through\n\n35:03.040 --> 35:07.240\n our existing interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are unknown\n\n35:07.240 --> 35:09.720\n even to us, some of them.\n\n35:09.720 --> 35:15.480\n And so this is a tricky, this is a tricky topic.\n\n35:15.480 --> 35:19.520\n So I guess there's a bunch of directions we could go with it but I want to come back to\n\n35:19.520 --> 35:24.440\n what the impulse was that was interesting around what is consciousness and how does\n\n35:24.440 --> 35:29.960\n it relate to us as social beings and how does it relate to the possibility of consciousness\n\n35:29.960 --> 35:30.960\n with AIs.\n\n35:30.960 --> 35:35.880\n Right, you're keeping us on track which is, which is wonderful, you're a wonderful hiking\n\n35:35.880 --> 35:36.880\n partner.\n\n35:36.880 --> 35:37.880\n Okay, yes.\n\n35:37.880 --> 35:43.180\n Let's go back to the initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social impulse\n\n35:43.180 --> 35:45.940\n connect to consciousness?\n\n35:45.940 --> 35:50.640\n Is consciousness a consequence of that social connection?\n\n35:50.640 --> 35:55.160\n I'm going to state a position and not argue it because it's honestly like it's a long\n\n35:55.160 --> 36:00.980\n hard thing to argue and we can totally do it another time if you want.\n\n36:00.980 --> 36:11.080\n I don't subscribe to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural networks.\n\n36:11.080 --> 36:17.880\n Obviously a lot of people do, obviously the philosophy of science orients towards that\n\n36:17.880 --> 36:24.600\n in not absolutely but largely.\n\n36:24.600 --> 36:33.920\n I think of the nature of first person, the universe of first person, of qualia as experience,\n\n36:33.920 --> 36:41.160\n sensation, desire, emotion, phenomenology, but the felt sense, not the we say emotion\n\n36:41.160 --> 36:45.320\n and we think of a neurochemical pattern or an endocrine pattern.\n\n36:45.320 --> 36:50.560\n But all of the physical stuff, the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:55.200\n and stuff like that that is measurable, repeatable.\n\n36:55.200 --> 37:00.880\n I think of the nature of first person and third person as ontologically orthogonal to\n\n37:00.880 --> 37:03.620\n each other, not reducible to each other.\n\n37:03.620 --> 37:06.840\n They're different kinds of stuff.\n\n37:06.840 --> 37:11.160\n So I think about the evolution of third person that we're quite used to thinking about from\n\n37:11.160 --> 37:14.400\n subatomic particles to atoms to molecules to on and on.\n\n37:14.400 --> 37:19.440\n I think about a similar kind of and corresponding evolution in the domain of first person from\n\n37:19.440 --> 37:24.720\n the way Whitehead talked about kind of prehension or proto qualia in earlier phases of self\n\n37:24.720 --> 37:29.240\n organization into higher orders of it and that there's correspondence, but that neither\n\n37:29.240 --> 37:35.960\n like the idealists do we reduce third person to first person, which is what idealists do,\n\n37:35.960 --> 37:40.840\n or neither like the physicalists do we reduce first person to third person.\n\n37:40.840 --> 37:46.440\n Obviously Bohm talked about an implicate order that was deeper than and gave rise to the\n\n37:46.440 --> 37:48.480\n explicate order of both.\n\n37:48.480 --> 37:49.920\n Nagel talks about something like that.\n\n37:49.920 --> 37:54.080\n I have a slightly different sense of that, but again, I'll just kind of not argue how\n\n37:54.080 --> 37:59.240\n that occurs for a moment and say, so rather than say, does consciousness emerge from,\n\n37:59.240 --> 38:07.340\n I'll talk about do higher capacities of consciousness emerge in relationship with.\n\n38:07.340 --> 38:12.320\n So it's not first person as a category emerging from third person, but increased complexity\n\n38:12.320 --> 38:17.160\n within the nature of first person and third person co evolving.\n\n38:17.160 --> 38:22.080\n Do I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural networks have deeper\n\n38:22.080 --> 38:29.920\n phenomenology, more complex, where it goes just from basic sensation to emotion to social\n\n38:29.920 --> 38:35.160\n awareness to abstract cognition to self reflexive abstract cognition?\n\n38:35.160 --> 38:36.160\n Yeah.\n\n38:36.160 --> 38:37.880\n But I wouldn't say that's the emergence of consciousness.\n\n38:37.880 --> 38:41.800\n I would say it's increased complexity within the domain of first person corresponding to\n\n38:41.800 --> 38:46.640\n increased complexity and the correspondence should not automatically be seen as causal.\n\n38:46.640 --> 38:50.000\n We can get into the arguments for why that often is the case.\n\n38:50.000 --> 38:57.080\n So would I say that obviously the sapient brain is pretty unique and a single sapient\n\n38:57.080 --> 38:58.280\n now has that, right?\n\n38:58.280 --> 39:03.760\n Even if it took sapiens evolving in tribes based on group selection to make that brain.\n\n39:03.760 --> 39:06.100\n So the group made it now that brain is there.\n\n39:06.100 --> 39:09.800\n Now if I take that single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise them\n\n39:09.800 --> 39:14.920\n in a box, they'll still not be very interesting even with the brain.\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:20.880\n But the brain does give hardware capacities that if conditioned in relationship can have\n\n39:20.880 --> 39:21.880\n interesting things emerge.\n\n39:21.880 --> 39:29.520\n So do I think that the human biology, types of human consciousness and types of social\n\n39:29.520 --> 39:32.760\n interaction all co emerged and co evolved?\n\n39:32.760 --> 39:33.760\n Yes.\n\n39:33.760 --> 39:38.580\n As a small aside, as you're talking about the biology, let me comment that I spent,\n\n39:38.580 --> 39:41.520\n this is what I do, this is what I do with my life.\n\n39:41.520 --> 39:47.400\n This is why I will never accomplish anything is I spent much of the morning trying to do\n\n39:47.400 --> 39:53.120\n research on how many computations the brain performs and how much energy it uses versus\n\n39:53.120 --> 40:00.080\n the state of the art CPUs and GPUs arriving at about 20 quadrillion.\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:03.560\n So that's two to the 10 to the 16 computations.\n\n40:03.560 --> 40:08.080\n So synaptic firings per second that the brain does.\n\n40:08.080 --> 40:15.840\n And that's about a million times faster than the let's say the 20 thread state of the\n\n40:15.840 --> 40:21.360\n arts Intel CPU, the 10th generation.\n\n40:21.360 --> 40:28.640\n And then there's similar calculation for the GPU and all ended up also trying to compute\n\n40:28.640 --> 40:32.600\n that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about.\n\n40:32.600 --> 40:36.020\n And then what does that mean in terms of calories per day, kilocalories?\n\n40:36.020 --> 40:44.780\n That's about for an average human brain, that's 250 to 300 calories a day.\n\n40:44.780 --> 40:54.800\n And so it ended up being a calculation where you're doing about 20 quadrillion calculations\n\n40:54.800 --> 40:59.280\n that are fueled by something like depending on your diet, three bananas.\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:05.760\n So three bananas results in a computation that's about a million times more powerful\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:08.320\n than the current state of the art computers.\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:10.720\n Now, let's take that one step further.\n\n41:10.720 --> 41:12.480\n There's some assumptions built in there.\n\n41:12.480 --> 41:17.240\n The assumption is that one, what the brain is doing is just computation.\n\n41:17.240 --> 41:21.760\n Two, the relevant computations are synaptic firings and that there's nothing other than\n\n41:21.760 --> 41:25.120\n synaptic firings that we have to factor.\n\n41:25.120 --> 41:28.040\n So I'm forgetting his name right now.\n\n41:28.040 --> 41:35.240\n There's a very famous neuroscientist at Stanford just passed away recently who did a lot of\n\n41:35.240 --> 41:40.320\n the pioneering work on glial cells and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge\n\n41:40.320 --> 41:42.280\n amount of the thinking, not just neurons.\n\n41:42.280 --> 41:46.440\n And it opened up this entirely different field of like what the brain is and what consciousness\n\n41:46.440 --> 41:47.440\n is.\n\n41:47.440 --> 41:51.960\n You look at Damasio's work on embodied cognition and how much of what we would consider consciousness\n\n41:51.960 --> 41:56.120\n or feeling is happening outside of the nervous system completely, happening in endocrine\n\n41:56.120 --> 42:00.560\n process involving lots of other cells and signal communication.\n\n42:00.560 --> 42:04.540\n You talk to somebody like Penrose who you've had on the show and even though the Penrose\n\n42:04.540 --> 42:08.720\n Hammerhoff conjecture is probably not right, is there something like that that might be\n\n42:08.720 --> 42:11.920\n the case where we're actually having to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum\n\n42:11.920 --> 42:14.820\n computation of microtubules?\n\n42:14.820 --> 42:16.800\n I'm not arguing for any of those.\n\n42:16.800 --> 42:20.800\n I'm arguing that we don't know how big the unknown unknown set is.\n\n42:20.800 --> 42:26.440\n Well, at the very least, this has become like an infomercial for the human brain.\n\n42:26.440 --> 42:29.820\n At the very, but wait, there's more.\n\n42:29.820 --> 42:33.400\n At the very least, the three bananas buys you a million times.\n\n42:33.400 --> 42:34.400\n At the very least.\n\n42:34.400 --> 42:35.400\n At the very least.\n\n42:35.400 --> 42:36.400\n That's impressive.\n\n42:36.400 --> 42:41.280\n And then you could have, and then the synaptic firings we're referring to is strictly the\n\n42:41.280 --> 42:42.280\n electrical signals.\n\n42:42.280 --> 42:45.880\n That could be the mechanical transmission of information, there's chemical transmission\n\n42:45.880 --> 42:49.520\n of information, there's all kinds of other stuff going on.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:52.600\n And then there's memory that's built in, that's also all tied in.\n\n42:52.600 --> 42:58.760\n Not to mention, which I'm learning more and more about, it's not just about the neurons.\n\n42:58.760 --> 43:02.320\n It's also about the immune system that's somehow helping with the computation.\n\n43:02.320 --> 43:06.960\n So the entirety and the entire body is helping with the computation.\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:07.960\n So the three bananas.\n\n43:07.960 --> 43:10.080\n It could buy you a lot.\n\n43:10.080 --> 43:12.320\n It could buy you a lot.\n\n43:12.320 --> 43:22.360\n But on the topic of sort of the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness, I\n\n43:22.360 --> 43:29.120\n think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain,\n\n43:29.120 --> 43:36.460\n just looking at systems where simple rules create incredible complexity.\n\n43:36.460 --> 43:38.300\n Not create.\n\n43:38.300 --> 43:40.180\n Incredible complexity emerges.\n\n43:40.180 --> 43:46.540\n So one of the simplest things to do that with is cellular automata.\n\n43:46.540 --> 43:53.960\n And there's, I don't know what it is, and maybe you can speak to it, we will certainly\n\n43:53.960 --> 44:02.360\n talk about the implications of this, but there's so few things that are as awe inspiring to\n\n44:02.360 --> 44:07.960\n me as knowing the rules of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks\n\n44:07.960 --> 44:08.960\n like.\n\n44:08.960 --> 44:15.280\n And it creates incredibly beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on, looks like there's\n\n44:15.280 --> 44:26.000\n actual organisms doing things that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:27.920\n mechanism.\n\n44:27.920 --> 44:31.440\n So with cellular automata, that's cells that are born and die.\n\n44:31.440 --> 44:34.560\n Born and die and they only know about each other's neighbors.\n\n44:34.560 --> 44:38.120\n And there's simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death.\n\n44:38.120 --> 44:44.760\n And then they create, at scale, organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands\n\n44:44.760 --> 44:49.160\n of cells and they're moving, they're moving around, they're communicating, they're sending\n\n44:49.160 --> 44:51.000\n signals to each other.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:59.040\n And you forget at moments at a time before you remember that the simple rules on cells\n\n44:59.040 --> 45:04.120\n is all that it took to create that.\n\n45:04.120 --> 45:15.480\n It's sad in that we can't come up with a simple description of that system that generalizes\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:19.040\n the behavior of the large organisms.\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:23.320\n We can only come up, we can only hope to come up with the thing, the fundamental physics\n\n45:23.320 --> 45:25.600\n or the fundamental rules of that system, I suppose.\n\n45:25.600 --> 45:29.880\n It's sad that we can't predict everything we know about the mathematics of those systems.\n\n45:29.880 --> 45:34.760\n It seems like we can't really in a nice way, like economics tries to do, to predict how\n\n45:34.760 --> 45:37.160\n this whole thing will unroll.\n\n45:37.160 --> 45:42.600\n But it's beautiful because of how simple it is underneath it all.\n\n45:42.600 --> 45:49.040\n So what do you make of the emergence of complexity from simple rules?\n\n45:49.040 --> 45:50.360\n What the hell is that about?\n\n45:50.360 --> 45:51.360\n Yeah.\n\n45:51.360 --> 45:56.800\n Well, we can see that something like flocking behavior, the murmuration, can be computer\n\n45:56.800 --> 45:57.800\n coded.\n\n45:57.800 --> 46:01.680\n It's a very hard set of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of\n\n46:01.680 --> 46:03.600\n complexity.\n\n46:03.600 --> 46:08.320\n And the whole field of complexity science and some of the subdisciplines like Stigma\n\n46:08.320 --> 46:14.980\n G are studying how following fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant colonies\n\n46:14.980 --> 46:19.240\n do this amazing thing where what you might describe as the organizational or computational\n\n46:19.240 --> 46:26.040\n capacity of the colony is so profound relative to what each individual ant is doing.\n\n46:26.040 --> 46:31.320\n I am not anywhere near as well versed in the cutting edge of cellular automata as I would\n\n46:31.320 --> 46:32.320\n like.\n\n46:32.320 --> 46:36.800\n Unfortunately, in terms of topics that I would like to get to and haven't, like ET's more\n\n46:36.800 --> 46:43.340\n Wolfram's A New Kind of Science, I have only skimmed and read reviews of and not read the\n\n46:43.340 --> 46:47.020\n whole thing or his newer work since.\n\n46:47.020 --> 46:53.280\n But his idea of the four basic kind of categories of emergent phenomena that can come from cellular\n\n46:53.280 --> 46:59.300\n automata and that one of them is kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity rather than\n\n46:59.300 --> 47:08.520\n just chaos or homogeneity or self termination or whatever.\n\n47:08.520 --> 47:11.900\n I think this is very interesting.\n\n47:11.900 --> 47:17.760\n It does not instantly make me think that biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules\n\n47:17.760 --> 47:19.800\n and or that human consciousness is.\n\n47:19.800 --> 47:26.400\n I'm not that reductionist oriented.\n\n47:26.400 --> 47:31.200\n So if you look at, say, Santa Fe Institute, one of the cofounders, Stuart Kaufman, his\n\n47:31.200 --> 47:33.220\n work, you should really get him on your show.\n\n47:33.220 --> 47:39.060\n So a lot of the questions that you like, one of Kaufman's more recent books after investigations\n\n47:39.060 --> 47:42.180\n and some of the real fundamental stuff was called Reinventing the Sacred and it had to\n\n47:42.180 --> 47:47.080\n do with some of these exact questions in kind of non reductionist approach, but that is\n\n47:47.080 --> 47:50.520\n not just silly hippie ism.\n\n47:50.520 --> 47:55.680\n And he was very interested in highly non ergodic systems where you couldn't take a lot of behavior\n\n47:55.680 --> 47:59.200\n over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of subsets over a longer period\n\n47:59.200 --> 48:01.960\n of time would do.\n\n48:01.960 --> 48:05.460\n And then going further, someone who spent some time at Santa Fe Institute and then kind\n\n48:05.460 --> 48:10.840\n of made a whole new field that you should have on, Dave Snowden, who some people call\n\n48:10.840 --> 48:16.300\n the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity unique to humans.\n\n48:16.300 --> 48:19.960\n And he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really doesn't\n\n48:19.960 --> 48:20.960\n cut it.\n\n48:20.960 --> 48:26.740\n Like we don't respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using Stigma\n\n48:26.740 --> 48:30.840\n G like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors, but it really\n\n48:30.840 --> 48:35.440\n doesn't work for trying to make sense of the Sistine Chapel and Picasso and general relativity\n\n48:35.440 --> 48:37.880\n creation and stuff like that.\n\n48:37.880 --> 48:43.280\n And it's because the termites are not doing abstraction, forecasting deep into the future\n\n48:43.280 --> 48:47.240\n and making choices now based on forecasts of the future, not just adaptive signals in\n\n48:47.240 --> 48:49.780\n the moment and evolutionary code from history.\n\n48:49.780 --> 48:51.120\n That's really different, right?\n\n48:51.120 --> 48:56.260\n Like making choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future.\n\n48:56.260 --> 49:02.160\n And with humans, our uniqueness one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli\n\n49:02.160 --> 49:06.100\n is much higher than it is with a termite.\n\n49:06.100 --> 49:08.960\n One of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely low.\n\n49:08.960 --> 49:11.040\n They're basically fungible within a class, right?\n\n49:11.040 --> 49:14.400\n There's different classes, but within a class they're basically fungible and their system\n\n49:14.400 --> 49:19.680\n uses that very high numbers and lots of loss, right?\n\n49:19.680 --> 49:20.680\n Lots of death and loss.\n\n49:20.680 --> 49:21.680\n But do you think the termite feels that way?\n\n49:21.680 --> 49:25.320\n Don't, don't you think we humans are deceiving ourselves about our uniqueness?\n\n49:25.320 --> 49:29.440\n Perhaps it doesn't, it just, isn't there some sense in which this emergence just creates\n\n49:29.440 --> 49:34.360\n different higher and higher levels of abstraction where every, at every layer, each organism\n\n49:34.360 --> 49:35.880\n feels unique?\n\n49:35.880 --> 49:36.880\n Is that possible?\n\n49:36.880 --> 49:40.240\n That we're all equally dumb but at different scales?\n\n49:40.240 --> 49:44.280\n No, I think uniqueness is evolving.\n\n49:44.280 --> 49:51.160\n I think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells of the same type\n\n49:51.160 --> 49:52.160\n are.\n\n49:52.160 --> 49:54.240\n And I think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are.\n\n49:54.240 --> 50:00.800\n And I think that highly K selected species are more unique than R selected species.\n\n50:00.800 --> 50:03.080\n So they're different evolutionary processes.\n\n50:03.080 --> 50:09.600\n The R selected species where you have a whole, a lot of death and very high birth rates,\n\n50:09.600 --> 50:16.080\n and not looking for as much individuality within or individual possible expression to\n\n50:16.080 --> 50:18.760\n cover the evolutionary search space within an individual.\n\n50:18.760 --> 50:22.840\n You're looking at it more in terms of a numbers game.\n\n50:22.840 --> 50:26.960\n So yeah, I would say there's probably more difference between one orca and the next than\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:29.880\n there is between one Cape buffalo and the next.\n\n50:29.880 --> 50:35.400\n Given that, it would be interesting to get your thoughts about memetic theory where we're\n\n50:35.400 --> 50:43.360\n imitating each other in the context of this idea of uniqueness.\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:46.180\n How much truth is there to that?\n\n50:46.180 --> 50:56.000\n How compelling is this worldview to you of Girardian memetic theory of desire where maybe\n\n50:56.000 --> 51:00.040\n you can explain it from your perspective, but it seems like imitating each other is\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:05.920\n the fundamental property of the behavior of human civilization.\n\n51:05.920 --> 51:09.400\n Well, imitation is not unique to humans, right?\n\n51:09.400 --> 51:11.800\n Monkeys imitate.\n\n51:11.800 --> 51:18.000\n So a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans.\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.640\n Humans do more of it.\n\n51:19.640 --> 51:24.360\n It's actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment.\n\n51:24.360 --> 51:27.020\n Monkeys can learn new behaviors, new...\n\n51:27.020 --> 51:31.620\n We've even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching other apes sign\n\n51:31.620 --> 51:33.180\n language.\n\n51:33.180 --> 51:34.840\n So that's a kind of mimesis, right?\n\n51:34.840 --> 51:38.200\n Kind of learning through imitation.\n\n51:38.200 --> 51:42.880\n And that needs to happen if they need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:44.420\n by their genetics, right?\n\n51:44.420 --> 51:49.120\n So within the same genome, they're learning new things based on the environment.\n\n51:49.120 --> 51:54.640\n And so based on someone else learn something first and so let's pick it up.\n\n51:54.640 --> 51:59.140\n How much a creature is the result of just its genetic programming and how much it's\n\n51:59.140 --> 52:02.300\n learning is a very interesting question.\n\n52:02.300 --> 52:06.080\n And I think this is a place where humans really show up radically different than everything\n\n52:06.080 --> 52:07.360\n else.\n\n52:07.360 --> 52:13.760\n And you can see it in the neoteny, how long we're basically fetal.\n\n52:13.760 --> 52:19.920\n That the closest ancestors to us, if we look at a chimp, a chimp can hold on to its mother's\n\n52:19.920 --> 52:22.820\n fur while she moves around day one.\n\n52:22.820 --> 52:26.640\n And obviously we see horses up and walking within 20 minutes.\n\n52:26.640 --> 52:30.560\n The fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it takes a horse 20 minutes and\n\n52:30.560 --> 52:34.320\n you say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year, like that's a long period of\n\n52:34.320 --> 52:37.360\n helplessness that wouldn't work for a horse, right?\n\n52:37.360 --> 52:40.320\n Like they or anything else.\n\n52:40.320 --> 52:46.000\n And not only could we not hold on to mom in the first day, it's three months before we\n\n52:46.000 --> 52:48.600\n can move our head volitionally.\n\n52:48.600 --> 52:52.440\n So it's like why are we embryonic for so long?\n\n52:52.440 --> 52:58.880\n Obviously it's like it's still fetal on the outside, had to be because couldn't keep growing\n\n52:58.880 --> 53:05.600\n inside and actually ever get out with big heads and narrower hips from going upright.\n\n53:05.600 --> 53:11.360\n So here's a place where there's a coevolution of the pattern of humans, specifically here\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:18.080\n our neoteny and what that portends to learning with our being tool making and environment\n\n53:18.080 --> 53:24.160\n modifying creatures, which is because we have the abstraction to make tools, we change our\n\n53:24.160 --> 53:26.760\n environments more than other creatures change their environments.\n\n53:26.760 --> 53:31.760\n The next most environment modifying creature to us is like a beaver.\n\n53:31.760 --> 53:36.780\n And then we're in LA, you fly into LAX and you look at the just orthogonal grid going\n\n53:36.780 --> 53:39.320\n on forever in all directions.\n\n53:39.320 --> 53:43.320\n And we've recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the earth is changing\n\n53:43.320 --> 53:47.880\n more from human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you're like, okay, wow,\n\n53:47.880 --> 53:53.800\n we're really in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying.\n\n53:53.800 --> 54:01.680\n So as soon as we started tool making, we were able to change our environments much more\n\n54:01.680 --> 54:02.680\n radically.\n\n54:02.680 --> 54:05.360\n We could put on clothes and go to a cold place.\n\n54:05.360 --> 54:10.480\n And this is really important because we actually went and became apex predators in every environment.\n\n54:10.480 --> 54:15.920\n We functioned like apex predators, polar bear can't leave the Arctic and the lion can't\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:18.160\n leave the Savannah and an orca can't leave the ocean.\n\n54:18.160 --> 54:21.360\n And we went and became apex predators in all those environments because of our tool creation\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:22.360\n capacity.\n\n54:22.360 --> 54:25.240\n We could become better predators than them adapted to the environment or at least with\n\n54:25.240 --> 54:27.320\n our tools adapted to the environment.\n\n54:27.320 --> 54:34.360\n So in every aspect towards any organism in any environment, we're incredibly good at\n\n54:34.360 --> 54:36.120\n becoming apex predators.\n\n54:36.120 --> 54:37.120\n Yes.\n\n54:37.120 --> 54:40.080\n And nothing else can do that kind of thing.\n\n54:40.080 --> 54:44.880\n There is no other apex predator that, you see the other apex predator is only getting\n\n54:44.880 --> 54:48.840\n better at being a predator through evolutionary process that's super slow and that super slow\n\n54:48.840 --> 54:52.180\n process creates co selective process with their environment.\n\n54:52.180 --> 54:56.480\n So as the predator becomes a tiny bit faster, it eats more of the slow prey, the genes of\n\n54:56.480 --> 54:58.960\n the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes faster.\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:03.800\n And so there's this kind of balancing and we in because of our tool making, we increased\n\n55:03.800 --> 55:08.580\n our predatory capacity faster than anything else could increase its resilience to it.\n\n55:08.580 --> 55:13.920\n As a result, we start outstripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools\n\n55:13.920 --> 55:15.640\n and going and becoming apex predator everywhere.\n\n55:15.640 --> 55:18.800\n This is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because we're not an apex predator.\n\n55:18.800 --> 55:22.540\n We're an apex predator, but we're something much more than that.\n\n55:22.540 --> 55:27.240\n Like just for an example, the top apex predator in the world, an orca.\n\n55:27.240 --> 55:31.680\n An orca can eat one big fish at a time, like one tuna, and it'll miss most of the time\n\n55:31.680 --> 55:33.760\n or one seal.\n\n55:33.760 --> 55:39.040\n And we can put a mile long drift net out on a single boat and pull up an entire school\n\n55:39.040 --> 55:40.040\n of them.\n\n55:40.040 --> 55:41.040\n Right?\n\n55:41.040 --> 55:42.040\n We can deplete the entire oceans of them.\n\n55:42.040 --> 55:43.040\n That's not an orca.\n\n55:43.040 --> 55:45.760\n That's not an apex predator.\n\n55:45.760 --> 55:49.640\n And that's not even including that we can then genetically engineer different creatures.\n\n55:49.640 --> 55:50.760\n We can extinct species.\n\n55:50.760 --> 55:52.840\n We can devastate whole ecosystems.\n\n55:52.840 --> 55:56.260\n We can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just human built worlds.\n\n55:56.260 --> 55:59.240\n We can build new types of natural creatures, synthetic life.\n\n55:59.240 --> 56:02.800\n So we are much more like little gods than we are like apex predators now, but we're\n\n56:02.800 --> 56:06.320\n still behaving as apex predators and little gods that behave as apex predators causes\n\n56:06.320 --> 56:10.780\n a problem kind of core to my assessment of the world.\n\n56:10.780 --> 56:13.080\n So what does it mean to be a predator?\n\n56:13.080 --> 56:19.680\n So a predator is somebody that effectively can mine the resources from a place.\n\n56:19.680 --> 56:28.440\n So for their survival, or is it also just purely like higher level objectives of violence\n\n56:28.440 --> 56:34.840\n and what is, can predators be predators towards the same, each other towards the same species?\n\n56:34.840 --> 56:39.960\n Like are we using the word predator sort of generally, which then connects to conflict\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:46.080\n and military conflict, violent conflict in this base of human species.\n\n56:46.080 --> 56:50.000\n Obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of their environment in a particular\n\n56:50.000 --> 56:54.680\n way, using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals out of the soil and nitrogen and\n\n56:54.680 --> 56:57.600\n carbon out of the air and like that.\n\n56:57.600 --> 57:01.400\n And we can say herbivores are being able to mine and concentrate that.\n\n57:01.400 --> 57:04.600\n So I wouldn't say mining the environment is unique to predator.\n\n57:04.600 --> 57:16.760\n Predator is generally being defined as mining other animals, right?\n\n57:16.760 --> 57:23.600\n We don't consider herbivores predators, but animal, which requires some type of violence\n\n57:23.600 --> 57:27.040\n capacity because animals move, plants don't move.\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:34.200\n So it requires some capacity to overtake something that can move and try to get away.\n\n57:34.200 --> 57:37.640\n We'll go back to the Gerard thing and then we'll come back here.\n\n57:37.640 --> 57:38.640\n Why are we neotenous?\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:42.040\n Why are we embryonic for so long?\n\n57:42.040 --> 57:47.020\n Because are we, did we just move from the Savannah to the Arctic and we need to learn\n\n57:47.020 --> 57:48.200\n new stuff?\n\n57:48.200 --> 57:51.640\n If we came genetically programmed, we would not be able to do that.\n\n57:51.640 --> 57:56.380\n Are we throwing spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain\n\n57:56.380 --> 57:57.380\n or are we texting?\n\n57:57.380 --> 57:59.780\n What is the adaptive behavior?\n\n57:59.780 --> 58:03.880\n Horses today in the wild and horses 10,000 years ago are doing pretty much the same stuff.\n\n58:03.880 --> 58:10.280\n And so since we make tools and we evolve our tools and then change our environment so quickly\n\n58:10.280 --> 58:14.520\n and other animals are largely the result of their environment, but we're environment modifying\n\n58:14.520 --> 58:19.240\n so rapidly, we need to come without too much programming so we can learn the environment\n\n58:19.240 --> 58:21.700\n we're in, learn the language, right?\n\n58:21.700 --> 58:27.360\n Which is going to be very important to learn the tool making.\n\n58:27.360 --> 58:32.600\n And so we have a very long period of relative helplessness because we aren't coded how to\n\n58:32.600 --> 58:36.680\n behave yet because we're imprinting a lot of software on how to behave that is useful\n\n58:36.680 --> 58:38.740\n to that particular time.\n\n58:38.740 --> 58:44.680\n So our mimesis is not unique to humans, but the total amount of it is really unique.\n\n58:44.680 --> 58:46.960\n And this is also where the uniqueness can go up, right?\n\n58:46.960 --> 58:51.760\n Is because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning\n\n58:51.760 --> 58:56.680\n through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of, it's almost like our\n\n58:56.680 --> 59:00.120\n hardware selected for software, right?\n\n59:00.120 --> 59:04.520\n Like if evolution is kind of doing these, think of as a hardware selection, I have problems\n\n59:04.520 --> 59:12.540\n with computer metaphors for biology, but I'll use this one here, that we have not had hardware\n\n59:12.540 --> 59:18.340\n changes since the beginning of sapiens, but our world is really, really different.\n\n59:18.340 --> 59:20.800\n And that's all changes in software, right?\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:27.280\n Changes on the same fundamental genetic substrate, what we're doing with these brains and minds\n\n59:27.280 --> 59:30.740\n and bodies and social groups and like that.\n\n59:30.740 --> 59:40.680\n And so, now, Gerard specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking, so\n\n59:40.680 --> 59:44.000\n we learn language, you and I would have a hard time learning Mandarin today or it would\n\n59:44.000 --> 59:47.220\n take a lot of work, we'd be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff, but a baby learns\n\n59:47.220 --> 59:50.320\n it instantly without anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis.\n\n59:50.320 --> 59:52.520\n So it's a powerful thing.\n\n59:52.520 --> 59:55.400\n They're obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they're doing that and all their\n\n59:55.400 --> 59:57.200\n attention is allocated to that.\n\n59:57.200 --> 1:00:01.480\n But they're also learning how to move their bodies and they're learning all kinds of stuff\n\n1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:02.560\n through mimesis.\n\n1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:06.760\n One of the things that Gerard says is they're also learning what to want.\n\n1:00:06.760 --> 1:00:07.880\n And they learn what to want.\n\n1:00:07.880 --> 1:00:10.580\n They learn desire by watching what other people want.\n\n1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:16.440\n And so, intrinsic to this, people end up wanting what other people want and if we can't have\n\n1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:21.760\n what other people have without taking it away from them, then that becomes a source of conflict.\n\n1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:29.420\n So the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict and that then the conflict\n\n1:00:29.420 --> 1:00:32.920\n energy within a group of people will build over time.\n\n1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:35.560\n This is a very, very crude interpretation of the theory.\n\n1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.800\n Can we just pause on that?\n\n1:00:37.800 --> 1:00:42.920\n For people who are not familiar and for me who hasn't, I'm loosely familiar but haven't\n\n1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:46.600\n internalized it, but every time I think about it, it's a very compelling view of the world.\n\n1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:53.400\n Whether it's true or not, it's quite, it's like when you take everything Freud says as\n\n1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:59.520\n truth, it's a very interesting way to think about the world and in the same way, thinking\n\n1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:11.320\n about the mimetic theory of desire that everything we want is imitation of other people's wants.\n\n1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.360\n We don't have any original wants.\n\n1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:15.840\n We're constantly imitating others.\n\n1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:21.400\n And so, and not just others, but others we're exposed to.\n\n1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:27.600\n So there's these little local pockets, however defined local, of people imitating each other.\n\n1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:33.880\n And one that's super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join.\n\n1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:37.000\n What do you want to imitate?\n\n1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:42.640\n It's the old like, whoever your friends are, that's what your life is going to be like.\n\n1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:43.640\n That's really powerful.\n\n1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:50.400\n I mean, it's depressing that we're so unoriginal, but it's also liberating in that if this holds\n\n1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:55.680\n true, that we can choose our life by choosing the people we hang out with.\n\n1:01:55.680 --> 1:01:57.120\n So okay.\n\n1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:01.020\n Thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they're more absolute than they actually\n\n1:02:01.020 --> 1:02:02.840\n are end up also being dangerous.\n\n1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:10.380\n We want to, I'm going to discuss here where I think we need to amend this particular theory.\n\n1:02:10.380 --> 1:02:14.460\n But specifically, you just said something that everyone who's paid attention knows is\n\n1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:19.080\n true experientially, which is who you're around affects who you become.\n\n1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:26.520\n And as libertarian and self determining and sovereign as we'd like to be, everybody I\n\n1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:31.640\n think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison, aspects of your personality\n\n1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:34.560\n would have to adapt or you wouldn't survive there, right?\n\n1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:37.020\n You would become different.\n\n1:02:37.020 --> 1:02:40.720\n If you grew up in Darfur versus Finland, you would be different with your same genetics,\n\n1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:44.440\n like just there's no real question about that.\n\n1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:50.320\n And that even today, if you hang out in a place with ultra marathoners as your roommates\n\n1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:55.360\n or all people who are obese as your roommates, the statistical likelihood of what happens\n\n1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.040\n to your fitness is pretty clear, right?\n\n1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.440\n Like the behavioral science of this is pretty clear.\n\n1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.280\n So the whole saying we are the average of the five people we spend the most time around.\n\n1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:07.800\n I think the more self reflective someone is and the more time they spend by themselves\n\n1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.800\n in self reflection, the less this is true, but it's still true.\n\n1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:16.680\n So one of the best things someone can do to become more self determined is be self determined\n\n1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:20.320\n about the environments they want to put themselves in, because to the degree that there is some\n\n1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:24.800\n self determination and some determination by the environment, don't be fighting an environment\n\n1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:27.140\n that is predisposing you in bad directions.\n\n1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:30.960\n Try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things that you want.\n\n1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:34.200\n In turn, try to affect the environment in ways that predispose positive things for those\n\n1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.240\n around you.\n\n1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:39.440\n Or perhaps also there's probably interesting ways to play with this.\n\n1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:45.840\n You could probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension\n\n1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:50.040\n in all directions to where you're actually free to decide whatever the heck you want,\n\n1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:56.820\n because the set of wants within your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you're\n\n1:03:56.820 --> 1:03:59.240\n free to choose whichever one.\n\n1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:03.360\n If there's enough tension, as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds.\n\n1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:09.920\n Yeah, I mean, you definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced.\n\n1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:17.240\n So if you have someone who is extremely oriented to self empowerment and someone who's extremely\n\n1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:21.320\n oriented to kind of empathy and compassion, both the dialectic of those is better than\n\n1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:24.000\n either of them on their own.\n\n1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.480\n If you have both of them inhabiting, being inhabited better than you by the same person\n\n1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:32.640\n and spending time around that person will probably do well for you.\n\n1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:36.920\n I think the thing you just mentioned is super important when it comes to cognitive schools,\n\n1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:43.880\n which is I think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their learning and\n\n1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:50.880\n their not just cognitive learning, but their meaningful problem solving communication and\n\n1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:54.860\n civic capacity, capacity to participate as a citizen with other people and making the\n\n1:04:54.860 --> 1:05:01.080\n world better is to be seeking dialectical synthesis all the time.\n\n1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:06.280\n And so in the Hegelian sense, if you have a thesis, you have an antithesis.\n\n1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:10.240\n So maybe we have libertarianism on one side and Marxist kind of communism on the other\n\n1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.240\n side.\n\n1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:16.760\n And one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice.\n\n1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:21.920\n And so we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they\n\n1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:25.280\n make more agentic choices, it'll produce a better whole for everybody.\n\n1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:28.080\n The other side saying, well, the individuals are conditioned by their environment who would\n\n1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:31.880\n choose to be born into Darfur rather than Finland.\n\n1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:39.000\n So we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because the environment conditions\n\n1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000\n the individuals.\n\n1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.400\n So you have a thesis and an antithesis.\n\n1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:46.040\n And then Hegel's ideas, you have a synthesis, which is a kind of higher order truth that\n\n1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:50.200\n understands how those relate in a way that neither of them do.\n\n1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.760\n And so it is actually at a higher order of complexity.\n\n1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:55.540\n So the first part would be, can I steel man each of these?\n\n1:05:55.540 --> 1:05:58.860\n Can I argue each one well enough that the proponents of it are like, totally, you got\n\n1:05:58.860 --> 1:06:00.040\n that?\n\n1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:04.680\n And not just argue it rhetorically, but can I inhabit it where I can try to see and feel\n\n1:06:04.680 --> 1:06:08.540\n the world the way someone seeing and feeling the world that way would?\n\n1:06:08.540 --> 1:06:12.520\n Because once I do, then I don't want to screw those people because there's truth in it,\n\n1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:13.520\n right?\n\n1:06:13.520 --> 1:06:14.520\n And I'm not going to go back to war with them.\n\n1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:18.400\n I'm going to go to finding solutions that could actually work at a higher order.\n\n1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:21.760\n If I don't go to a higher order, then there's war.\n\n1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:25.680\n And but then the higher order thing would be, well, it seems like the individual does\n\n1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:28.800\n affect the commons and the collective and other people.\n\n1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:33.120\n It also seems like the collective conditions individuals at least statistically.\n\n1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.480\n And I can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto and pulled himself up\n\n1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:38.480\n by his bootstraps.\n\n1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:42.120\n But I can also say statistically that most people born into the ghetto show up differently\n\n1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:44.520\n than most people born into the Hamptons.\n\n1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:49.480\n And so unless you want to argue that and have you take your child from the Hamptons and\n\n1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.980\n put them in the ghetto, then like, come on, be realistic about this thing.\n\n1:06:52.980 --> 1:07:00.240\n So how do we make, we don't want social systems that make weak dependent individuals, right?\n\n1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:01.240\n The welfare argument.\n\n1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:08.080\n But we also don't want no social system that supports individuals to do better.\n\n1:07:08.080 --> 1:07:12.300\n We don't want individuals where their self expression and agency fucks the environment\n\n1:07:12.300 --> 1:07:15.680\n and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever.\n\n1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:21.560\n So can we make it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning\n\n1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:22.560\n other individuals?\n\n1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:26.560\n Can we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty,\n\n1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:27.560\n right?\n\n1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:28.560\n That would be the synthesis.\n\n1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:33.280\n So the thing that I'm coming to here is if people have that as a frame, and sometimes\n\n1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:37.600\n it's not just thesis and antithesis, it's like eight different views, right?\n\n1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:39.520\n Can I steel man each view?\n\n1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:42.240\n This is not just, can I take the perspective, but am I seeking them?\n\n1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:46.600\n Am I actively trying to inhabit other people's perspective?\n\n1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:52.060\n Then can I really try to essentialize it and argue the best points of it, both the sense\n\n1:07:52.060 --> 1:07:57.280\n making about reality and the values, why these values actually matter?\n\n1:07:57.280 --> 1:08:04.020\n Then just like I want to seek those perspectives, then I want to seek, is there a higher order\n\n1:08:04.020 --> 1:08:08.560\n set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize the sense making\n\n1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:10.360\n of all of them simultaneously?\n\n1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:13.140\n Maybe I won't get it, but I want to be seeking it and I want to be seeking progressively\n\n1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:14.540\n better ones.\n\n1:08:14.540 --> 1:08:21.960\n So this is perspective seeking, driving perspective taking, and then seeking synthesis.\n\n1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:31.680\n I think that that one cognitive disposition might be the most helpful thing.\n\n1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:36.040\n Would you put a title of dialectic synthesis on that process because that seems to be such\n\n1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:42.680\n a part, so like this rigorous empathy, like it's not just empathy.\n\n1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:48.240\n It's empathy with rigor, like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews\n\n1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:50.840\n and then try to find a higher order synthesis.\n\n1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:58.080\n Okay, so I remember last night you told me when we first met, you said that you looked\n\n1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:01.800\n in somebody's eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some ways that they had suffered\n\n1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:03.880\n and so you could trust them.\n\n1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:08.000\n Empathy pathos, right, creates a certain sense of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy.\n\n1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:14.000\n So empathy is actually feeling the suffering of somebody else and feeling the depth of\n\n1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000\n their sentience.\n\n1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000\n I don't want to fuck them anymore.\n\n1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000\n I don't want to hurt them.\n\n1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:22.480\n I don't want to behave, I don't want my proposition to go through when I go and inhabit the perspective\n\n1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:25.980\n of the other people if they feel that's really going to mess them up, right?\n\n1:09:25.980 --> 1:09:30.320\n And so the rigorous empathy, it's different than just compassion, which is I generally\n\n1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:31.320\n care.\n\n1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:34.280\n I have a generalized care, but I don't know what it's like to be them.\n\n1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:37.500\n I can never know what it's like to be them perfectly and that there's a humility you\n\n1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:42.480\n have to have, which is my most rigorous attempt is still not it.\n\n1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:46.720\n My most rigorous attempt, mine, to know what it's like to be a woman is still not it.\n\n1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:49.520\n I have no question that if I was actually a woman, it would be different than my best\n\n1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:50.520\n guesses.\n\n1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.560\n I have no question if I was actually black, it would be different than my best guesses.\n\n1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:57.880\n So there's a humility in that which keeps me listening because I don't think that I\n\n1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:02.440\n know fully, but I want to, and I'm going to keep trying better to.\n\n1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:05.560\n And then I want to accross them, and then I want to say, is there a way we can forward\n\n1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:07.920\n together and not have to be in war?\n\n1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:12.400\n It has to be something that could meet the values that everyone holds, that could reconcile\n\n1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:17.000\n the partial sensemaking that everyone holds, and that could offer a way forward that is\n\n1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:21.280\n more agreeable than the partial perspectives at war with each other.\n\n1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:26.600\n But so the more you succeed at this empathy with humility, the more you're carrying the\n\n1:10:26.600 --> 1:10:30.000\n burden of other people's pain, essentially.\n\n1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:38.720\n Now, this goes back to the question of do I see us as one being or 7.8 billion.\n\n1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:47.120\n I think if I'm overwhelmed with my own pain, I can't empathize that much because I don't\n\n1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:48.120\n have the bandwidth.\n\n1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:49.680\n I don't have the capacity.\n\n1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:53.080\n If I don't feel like I can do something about a particular problem in the world, it's hard\n\n1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:56.040\n to feel it because it's just too devastating.\n\n1:10:56.040 --> 1:11:00.280\n And so a lot of people go numb and even go nihilistic because they just don't feel the\n\n1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:01.280\n agency.\n\n1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:05.680\n So as I actually become more empowered as an individual and have more sense of agency,\n\n1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:10.560\n I also become more empowered to be more empathetic for others and be more connected to that shared\n\n1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:15.720\n burden and want to be able to make choices on behalf of and in benefit of.\n\n1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:23.620\n So this way of living seems like a way of living that would solve a lot of problems\n\n1:11:23.620 --> 1:11:28.540\n in society from a cellular automata perspective.\n\n1:11:28.540 --> 1:11:34.380\n So if you have a bunch of little agents behaving in this way, my intuition, there'll be interesting\n\n1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:39.740\n complexities that emerge, but my intuition is it will create a society that's very different\n\n1:11:39.740 --> 1:11:44.760\n and recognizably better than the one we have today.\n\n1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:45.760\n How much like...\n\n1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:49.960\n Oh, wait, hold that question because I want to come back to it, but this brings us back\n\n1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:51.620\n to Gerard, which we didn't answer.\n\n1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:52.620\n The conflict theory.\n\n1:11:52.620 --> 1:11:53.620\n Yes.\n\n1:11:53.620 --> 1:11:54.840\n Because about how to get past the conflict theory.\n\n1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:55.840\n Yes.\n\n1:11:55.840 --> 1:11:59.040\n You know the Robert Frost poem about the two paths and you never have enough time to return\n\n1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:00.040\n back to the other?\n\n1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:01.400\n We're going to have to do that quite a lot.\n\n1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:08.320\n We're going to be living that poem over and over again, but yes, how to...\n\n1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:09.320\n Let's return back.\n\n1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:10.320\n Okay.\n\n1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:14.500\n So the rest of the argument goes, you learn to want what other people want, therefore\n\n1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:19.200\n fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has.\n\n1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:24.960\n And then people are in conflict over trying to get the same stuff, power, status, attention,\n\n1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:27.780\n physical stuff, a mate, whatever it is.\n\n1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:30.680\n And then we learn the conflict by watching.\n\n1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:33.280\n And so then the conflict becomes metic.\n\n1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:37.840\n And we become on the Palestinian side or the Israeli side or the communist or capitalist\n\n1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:41.460\n side or the left or right politically or whatever it is.\n\n1:12:41.460 --> 1:12:46.720\n And until eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type\n\n1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:50.920\n of violence is needed to get the bad guy, whoever it is that we're going to blame.\n\n1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:55.180\n And you know, Gerard talks about why scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount\n\n1:12:55.180 --> 1:12:56.180\n of violence.\n\n1:12:56.180 --> 1:13:00.460\n Let's blame a scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were.\n\n1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:03.600\n But if we all believe it, then we can all kind of calm down with the conflict energy.\n\n1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.240\n It's a really interesting concept, by the way.\n\n1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:11.200\n I mean, you beautifully summarized it, but the idea that there's a scapegoat, that there's\n\n1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:15.900\n this kind of thing naturally leads to a conflict and then they find the other, some group that's\n\n1:13:15.900 --> 1:13:20.360\n the other that's either real or artificial as the cause of the conflict.\n\n1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:25.040\n Well, it's always artificial because the cause of the conflict in Gerard is the mimesis of\n\n1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.040\n desire itself.\n\n1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:27.640\n And how do we attack that?\n\n1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:30.240\n How do we attack that it's our own desire?\n\n1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:33.880\n So this now gets to something more like Buddha said, right, which was desire is the cause\n\n1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:34.880\n of suffering.\n\n1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:40.160\n Gerard and Buddha would kind of agree in this way.\n\n1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:46.720\n So but that's that explains I mean, again, it's a compelling description of human history\n\n1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.040\n that we do tend to come up with the other.\n\n1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:51.040\n And\n\n1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:55.440\n okay, kind of I just I just had such a funny experience with someone critiquing Gerard\n\n1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:59.760\n the other day in such an elegant and beautiful and simple way.\n\n1:13:59.760 --> 1:14:12.760\n It's a friend who's grew up Aboriginal Australian, is a scholar of Aboriginal social technologies.\n\n1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:16.960\n He's like, nah man, Gerard just made shit up about how tribes work.\n\n1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:21.080\n Like we come from a tribe, we've got tens of thousands of years, and we didn't have\n\n1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:23.880\n increasing conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone.\n\n1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:28.040\n We'd have a little bit of conflict and then we would dance and then everybody'd be fine.\n\n1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:31.120\n We'd dance around the campfire, everyone would like kind of physically get the energy out,\n\n1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:34.800\n we'd look in each other's eyes, we'd have positive bonding, and then we're fine.\n\n1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:36.540\n And nobody, no scapegoats.\n\n1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:37.540\n And\n\n1:14:37.540 --> 1:14:42.680\n I think that's called the Joe Rogan theory of desire, which is, he's like, all all of\n\n1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:47.000\n human problems have to do with the fact that you don't do enough hard shit in your day.\n\n1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:51.720\n So maybe, maybe just dance it because he says like doing exercise and running on the treadmill\n\n1:14:51.720 --> 1:14:55.320\n gets gets all the demons out and maybe just dancing gets all the demons out.\n\n1:14:55.320 --> 1:15:00.440\n So this is why I say we have to be careful with taking an idea that seems too explanatory\n\n1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:06.080\n and then taking it as a given and then saying, well, now that we're stuck with the fact that\n\n1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:09.900\n conflict is inexorable because human, because mimetic desire and therefore, how do we deal\n\n1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.920\n with the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence?\n\n1:15:12.920 --> 1:15:17.080\n Well, no, the whole thing might be actually gibberish, meaning it's only true in certain\n\n1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.200\n conditions and other conditions it's not true.\n\n1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.340\n So the deeper question is under which conditions is that true?\n\n1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:23.960\n Under which conditions is it not true?\n\n1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:26.000\n What do those other conditions make possible and look like?\n\n1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:31.360\n And in general, we should stay away from really compelling models of reality because there's\n\n1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:36.040\n something about, about our brains that these models become sticky and we can't even think\n\n1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:37.040\n outside of them.\n\n1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:38.040\n So.\n\n1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:39.040\n It's not that we stay away from them.\n\n1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:42.540\n It's that we know that the model of reality is never reality.\n\n1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:43.540\n That's the key thing.\n\n1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:47.280\n Humility again, it goes back to just having the humility that you don't have a perfect\n\n1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.480\n model of reality.\n\n1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:52.060\n There's an ep, the, the model of reality could never be reality.\n\n1:15:52.060 --> 1:16:00.000\n The process of modeling is inherently information reduction and I can never show that the unknown\n\n1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.480\n unknown set has been factored.\n\n1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:05.720\n It's back to the cellular automata.\n\n1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:10.240\n You can't, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:19.300\n Like when you realize it's unfortunately, sadly impossible to, to create a model of\n\n1:16:19.300 --> 1:16:26.440\n cellular automata, even if you know the basic rules that predict to even any degree of accuracy,\n\n1:16:26.440 --> 1:16:32.200\n what how that system will evolve, which is fascinating mathematically.\n\n1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:33.200\n Sorry.\n\n1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:34.400\n I think about it quite a lot.\n\n1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:36.400\n It's very annoying.\n\n1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:41.980\n Wolfram has this rule 30, like you should be able to predict it.\n\n1:16:41.980 --> 1:16:48.040\n It's so simple, but you can't predict what's going to be like, there's a, there's a problem\n\n1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:53.240\n he defines, like try to predict some aspect of the middle, middle column of the system,\n\n1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:54.760\n just anything about it.\n\n1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:55.760\n What's going to happen in the future.\n\n1:16:55.760 --> 1:17:03.960\n And you can't, you can't, it sucks because then we can't make sense of this world in\n\n1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:07.680\n a real, in a reality, in a definitive way.\n\n1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:11.920\n It's always like in the striving, like it, we're always striving.\n\n1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:12.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:15.480\n I don't think this sucks.\n\n1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:17.880\n That so that's a feature, not a bug.\n\n1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:21.520\n Well, that's assuming a designer.\n\n1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:23.240\n I would say I don't think it sucks.\n\n1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:27.800\n I think it's not only beautiful, but maybe necessary for beauty.\n\n1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:30.000\n The mess.\n\n1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:35.360\n So you're a, so you're, you're disagree Jordan Pearson should clean up your room.\n\n1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:36.720\n You like the rooms messy.\n\n1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:39.560\n It's a, it's essential for the, for beauty.\n\n1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:42.640\n It's not, it's not that it's okay.\n\n1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:46.080\n I take, I have no idea if it was intended this way.\n\n1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:52.560\n And so I'm just interpreting it a way I like the commandment about having no false idols\n\n1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:58.600\n to me, the way I interpret that that is meaningful is that re reality is sacred to me.\n\n1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:04.920\n I have a reverence for reality, but I know my best understanding of it is never complete.\n\n1:18:04.920 --> 1:18:11.900\n I know my best model of it is a model where I tried to make some kind of predictive capacity\n\n1:18:11.900 --> 1:18:16.600\n by reducing the complexity of it to a set of stuff that I could observe and then a subset\n\n1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:20.680\n of that stuff that I thought was the causal dynamics and then some set of, you know, mechanisms\n\n1:18:20.680 --> 1:18:22.100\n that are involved.\n\n1:18:22.100 --> 1:18:27.960\n And what we find is that it can be super useful, like Newtonian gravity can help us do ballistic\n\n1:18:27.960 --> 1:18:30.080\n curves and all kinds of super useful stuff.\n\n1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:34.520\n And then we get to the place where it doesn't explain what's happening at the cosmological\n\n1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:36.920\n scale or at a quantum scale.\n\n1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:42.120\n And at each time, what we're finding is we excluded stuff.\n\n1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:46.120\n And it also doesn't explain the reconciliation of gravity with quantum mechanics and the\n\n1:18:46.120 --> 1:18:48.400\n other kind of fundamental laws.\n\n1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:53.000\n So models can be useful, but they're never true with a capital T, meaning they're never\n\n1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:59.640\n an actual real full, they're never a complete description of what's happening in real systems.\n\n1:18:59.640 --> 1:19:02.800\n They can be a complete description of what's happening in an artificial system that was\n\n1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.700\n the result of applying a model.\n\n1:19:04.700 --> 1:19:07.960\n So the model of a circuit board and the circuit board are the same thing, but I would argue\n\n1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:11.760\n that the model of a cell and the cell are not the same thing.\n\n1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:16.640\n And I would say this is key to what we call complexity versus the complicated, which is\n\n1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:24.040\n a distinction Dave Snowden made well in defining the difference between simple, complicated,\n\n1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:26.060\n complex and chaotic systems.\n\n1:19:26.060 --> 1:19:30.160\n But one of the definers in complex systems is that no matter how you model the complex\n\n1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:34.360\n system, it will still have some emergent behavior not predicted by the model.\n\n1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.740\n Can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated?\n\n1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:41.600\n Complicated means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can\n\n1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:42.600\n do.\n\n1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:44.200\n We can program it.\n\n1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:49.000\n All human, not all, for the most part, human built things are complicated.\n\n1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.180\n They don't self organize.\n\n1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:52.240\n They don't self repair.\n\n1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:57.640\n They're not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them where, sorry, for human\n\n1:19:57.640 --> 1:20:04.200\n systems, for human technologies, human technologies, that are basically the application of models\n\n1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:06.800\n right.\n\n1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:12.240\n And engineering is kind of applied science, science as the modeling process.\n\n1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:19.920\n And but with humans are complex, complex stuff with biological type stuff and sociological\n\n1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:25.480\n type stuff, it more has generator functions and even those can't be fully explicated than\n\n1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:30.840\n it has or our explanation can't prove that it has closure of what would be in the unknown\n\n1:20:30.840 --> 1:20:33.520\n unknown set where we keep finding like, oh, it's just the genome.\n\n1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:37.100\n Oh, well now it's the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the epigenome\n\n1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:38.100\n because of the proteome.\n\n1:20:38.100 --> 1:20:41.780\n And then there's mitochondrial DNA and then viruses affected and fuck, right?\n\n1:20:41.780 --> 1:20:46.820\n So it's like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing.\n\n1:20:46.820 --> 1:20:49.760\n So on Facebook, you know how you can list your relationship as complicated?\n\n1:20:49.760 --> 1:20:52.160\n It should actually say it's, it's complex.\n\n1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:54.980\n That's the more accurate description.\n\n1:20:54.980 --> 1:21:01.480\n You self terminating is a really interesting idea that you talk about quite a bit.\n\n1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:04.080\n First of all, what is a self terminating system?\n\n1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:11.080\n And I think you have a sense, correct me if I'm wrong, that human civilization is a currently\n\n1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:16.180\n is, is a self terminating system.\n\n1:21:16.180 --> 1:21:20.240\n Why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what soft self terminating\n\n1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:21.240\n means?\n\n1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:33.400\n Okay, so if we look at human societies historically, human civilizations, it's not that hard to\n\n1:21:33.400 --> 1:21:37.920\n realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don't exist anymore.\n\n1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:40.640\n So they had a life cycle, they died for some reason.\n\n1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.320\n So we don't still have the early Egyptian empire or Inca or Maya or Aztec or any of\n\n1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:47.320\n those, right?\n\n1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:52.560\n So they, they terminated, sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside\n\n1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:53.560\n in war.\n\n1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:54.560\n Sometimes it seems like they self terminated.\n\n1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:57.720\n When we look at Easter Island, it was a self termination.\n\n1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:00.680\n So let's go ahead and take an island situation.\n\n1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:05.180\n If I have an island and we are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources\n\n1:22:05.180 --> 1:22:09.760\n can replicate themselves and there's a finite space there, that system is going to self\n\n1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:10.760\n terminate.\n\n1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:13.520\n It's not going to be able to keep doing that thing because you'll get to a place of there's\n\n1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:20.080\n no resources left and then you get a, so now if I'm utilizing the resources faster than\n\n1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:25.320\n they can replicate or faster than they can replenish and I'm actually growing our population\n\n1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:30.400\n in the process, I'm even increasing the rate of the utilization of resources, I might get\n\n1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:35.000\n an exponential curve and then hit a wall and then just collapse the exponential curve rather\n\n1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:39.980\n than do an S curve or some other kind of thing.\n\n1:22:39.980 --> 1:22:47.060\n So self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate system that is debasing\n\n1:22:47.060 --> 1:22:50.480\n its own substrate, that is debasing what it depends upon.\n\n1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:58.320\n So you're right that if you look at empires, they rise and fall throughout human history,\n\n1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:02.080\n but not this time, bro.\n\n1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:04.680\n This one's going to last forever.\n\n1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:06.520\n I like that idea.\n\n1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:10.760\n I think that if we don't understand why all the previous ones failed, we can't ensure\n\n1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:11.760\n that.\n\n1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:15.240\n And so I think it's very important to understand it well so that we can have that be a designed\n\n1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.760\n outcome with somewhat decent probability.\n\n1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:24.100\n So we're, it's sort of in terms of consuming the resources on the island, we're a clever\n\n1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:33.800\n bunch and we keep coming up, especially when on the horizon there is a termination point,\n\n1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:40.680\n we keep coming up with clever ways of avoiding disaster, of avoiding collapse, of constructing.\n\n1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:44.760\n This is where technological innovation, this is where growth comes in, coming up with different\n\n1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:50.060\n ways to improve productivity and the way society functions such that we consume less resources\n\n1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:53.880\n or get a lot more from the resources we have.\n\n1:23:53.880 --> 1:24:02.080\n So there's some sense in which there's a human ingenuity is a source for optimism about the\n\n1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:07.720\n future of this particular system that may not be self terminating.\n\n1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:13.080\n If there's more innovation than there is consumption.\n\n1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:17.400\n So overconsumption of resources is just one way I think can self terminate.\n\n1:24:17.400 --> 1:24:18.920\n We're just kind of starting here.\n\n1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:27.480\n But there are reasons for optimism and pessimism then they're both worth understanding and\n\n1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:31.960\n there's failure modes on understanding either without the other.\n\n1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:38.320\n As we mentioned previously, there's what I would call naive techno optimism, naive techno\n\n1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:43.520\n capital optimism that says stuff just has been getting better and better and we wouldn't\n\n1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:48.160\n want to live in the dark ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and we know the\n\n1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:52.240\n proponents of those models and this stuff is going to kind of keep getting better.\n\n1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:55.720\n Of course there are problems, but human ingenuity rises to its supply and demand will solve\n\n1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:56.720\n the problems, whatever.\n\n1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:03.600\n Would you put Rick or as well in that, or in that bucket, is there some specific people\n\n1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:08.600\n you have in mind or naive optimism is truly naive to where you're essentially just have\n\n1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:13.400\n an optimism that's blind to any kind of realities of the way technology progresses.\n\n1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:22.080\n I don't think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about it is perfectly naive.\n\n1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:23.080\n Gotcha.\n\n1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:24.080\n But there might be.\n\n1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:25.720\n It's a platonic ideal.\n\n1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:29.640\n There might be a bias in the nature of the assessment.\n\n1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:40.320\n I would also say there's kind of naive techno pessimism and there are critics of technology.\n\n1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:46.200\n I mean, you read the Unabomber's Manifesto on why technology can't not result in our\n\n1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:51.280\n self termination, so we have to take it out before it gets any further.\n\n1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:58.080\n But also if you read a lot of the X risk community, you know, Bostrom and friends, it's like our\n\n1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:04.160\n total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up.\n\n1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:11.780\n And so I think that there are, we have to hold together where our positive possibilities\n\n1:26:11.780 --> 1:26:16.920\n and our risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities\n\n1:26:16.920 --> 1:26:22.640\n to be realized long term, all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen.\n\n1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:26.640\n Any of the catastrophic risks happening is enough to keep that positive outcome from\n\n1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:27.640\n occurring.\n\n1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:30.020\n So how do we ensure that none of them happen?\n\n1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:33.100\n If we want to say, let's have a civilization that doesn't collapse.\n\n1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:38.960\n So again, Collapse Theory, it's worth looking at books like The Collapse of Complex Societies\n\n1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:39.960\n by Joseph Tainter.\n\n1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:49.640\n It does an analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional decay, civilizational\n\n1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:51.440\n decay reasons.\n\n1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:55.720\n Baudrillard in Simulation and Simulacra looks at a very different way of looking at how\n\n1:26:55.720 --> 1:26:59.720\n institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and it becomes kind of\n\n1:26:59.720 --> 1:27:02.800\n more internally parasitic on itself.\n\n1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:06.640\n Obviously Jared Diamond made a more popular book called Collapse.\n\n1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:10.600\n And as we were mentioning, the anticatheria mechanism has been getting attention in the\n\n1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:11.600\n news lately.\n\n1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.240\n It was like a 2000 year old clock, right?\n\n1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:15.960\n Like metal gears.\n\n1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:23.800\n And does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress?\n\n1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:29.440\n And from a society that was relatively technologically advanced.\n\n1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:35.720\n So what I'm interested in here is being able to say, okay, well, why did previous societies\n\n1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:38.080\n fail?\n\n1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:44.960\n Can we understand that abstractly enough that we can make a civilizational model that isn't\n\n1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:49.480\n just trying to solve one type of failure, but solve the underlying things that generate\n\n1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:51.560\n the failures as a whole?\n\n1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:56.160\n Are there some underlying generator functions or patterns that would make a system self\n\n1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:57.240\n terminating?\n\n1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:00.600\n And can we solve those and have that be the kernel of a new civilizational model that\n\n1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:02.960\n is not self terminating?\n\n1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:06.920\n And can we then be able to actually look at the categories of extras we're aware of and\n\n1:28:06.920 --> 1:28:10.440\n see that we actually have resilience in the presence of those?\n\n1:28:10.440 --> 1:28:13.160\n Not just resilience, but antifragility.\n\n1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:18.920\n And I would say for the optimism to be grounded, it has to actually be able to understand the\n\n1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:22.540\n risk space well and have adequate solutions for it.\n\n1:28:22.540 --> 1:28:31.860\n So can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying sources of catastrophic\n\n1:28:31.860 --> 1:28:37.480\n failures of the system and overconsumption that's built in into self terminating systems?\n\n1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:42.400\n So both the overconsumption, which is like the slow death, and then there's the fast\n\n1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:45.720\n death of nuclear war and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:53.760\n AGI, biotech, bioengineering, nanotechnology, nano, my favorite nanobots.\n\n1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:59.960\n Nanobots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me that I could just know that\n\n1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:06.160\n I would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead in building them without\n\n1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:08.680\n sufficiently thinking about the negative consequences.\n\n1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:14.080\n I would definitely be, I would be podcasting all about the negative consequences, but when\n\n1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:20.800\n I go back home, I'd be, I'd just in my heart know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant\n\n1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:24.600\n of ape, no offense to apes.\n\n1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:34.360\n I want to backtrack on my previous comments about, negative comments about apes.\n\n1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:39.020\n That I have that sense of excitement that would result in problems.\n\n1:29:39.020 --> 1:29:43.800\n So sorry, a lot of things said, but what's, can we start to pull it a thread because you've\n\n1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:50.200\n also provided a kind of a beautiful general approach to this, which is this dialectic\n\n1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:57.440\n synthesis or just rigorous empathy, whatever, whatever word we want to put to it, that seems\n\n1:29:57.440 --> 1:30:01.960\n to be from the individual perspective as one way to sort of live in the world as we tried\n\n1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:06.180\n to figure out how to construct non self terminating systems.\n\n1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:08.200\n So what, what are some underlying sources?\n\n1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:09.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:17.120\n First I have to say, I actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing Grey Goo and engines\n\n1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:23.880\n of creation back in the day to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to the\n\n1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:32.600\n risks of the nanotech as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be.\n\n1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:37.360\n There's definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and\n\n1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:46.800\n don't focus on the risks or pretend there aren't risks because they get to market first.\n\n1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:51.360\n And then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is\n\n1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:53.320\n to the commons or wherever happen to have it.\n\n1:30:53.320 --> 1:30:56.640\n Other people are going to have to solve those, but now they have the power and capital associated.\n\n1:30:56.640 --> 1:31:01.600\n The person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design and go slower is probably\n\n1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:04.520\n not going to move into positions of as much power influences quickly.\n\n1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:08.720\n So this is one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the bad game theoretic dispositions\n\n1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:12.820\n in the system relative to its own stability.\n\n1:31:12.820 --> 1:31:17.320\n And the key aspect to that, sorry to interrupt, is the externalities generated.\n\n1:31:17.320 --> 1:31:18.680\n Yes.\n\n1:31:18.680 --> 1:31:21.840\n What flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here?\n\n1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:24.280\n What's your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream?\n\n1:31:24.280 --> 1:31:25.920\n So mine is coconut.\n\n1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:28.000\n Nobody seems to like coconut ice cream.\n\n1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:36.000\n So ice cream aside, what are you most worried about in terms of catastrophic risk that will\n\n1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:44.720\n help us kind of make concrete the discussion we're having about how to fix this whole thing?\n\n1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:45.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:49.880\n I think it's worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just kind of orient everyone to\n\n1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:50.880\n it.\n\n1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:55.000\n We don't have to go all the way back to the aliens who've seen all of civilization.\n\n1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:03.040\n But to just recognize that for all of human history, as far as we're aware, there were\n\n1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:07.400\n existential risks to civilizations and they happened, right?\n\n1:32:07.400 --> 1:32:12.940\n Like there were civilizations that were killed in war, tribes that were killed in tribal\n\n1:32:12.940 --> 1:32:13.940\n warfare or whatever.\n\n1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:18.220\n So people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with.\n\n1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:20.500\n It's just those were local phenomena, right?\n\n1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:22.040\n It wasn't a fully global phenomena.\n\n1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.440\n So an empire could fall and surrounding empires didn't fall.\n\n1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:30.020\n Maybe they came in and filled the space.\n\n1:32:30.020 --> 1:32:35.720\n The first time that we were able to think about catastrophic risk, not from like a solar\n\n1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:39.000\n flare or something that we couldn't control, but from something that humans would actually\n\n1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:43.100\n create at a global level was World War II and the bomb.\n\n1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:47.480\n Because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually mess up\n\n1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:50.140\n everything at a global level that could mess up habitability.\n\n1:32:50.140 --> 1:32:53.120\n We just weren't powerful enough to do that before.\n\n1:32:53.120 --> 1:32:55.160\n It's not that we didn't behave in ways that would have done it.\n\n1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:59.520\n We just only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect.\n\n1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:04.680\n And so it's important to get that there's the entire world before World War II where\n\n1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:09.340\n we don't have the ability to make a nonhabitable biosphere, nonhabitable for us.\n\n1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:14.600\n And then there's World War II and the beginning of a completely new phase where global human\n\n1:33:14.600 --> 1:33:18.640\n induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing.\n\n1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:23.360\n And that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way,\n\n1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:28.280\n which is, you know, when you study history, it's amazing how big a percentage of history\n\n1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:32.840\n is studying war, right, and the history of war, as you said, European history and whatever.\n\n1:33:32.840 --> 1:33:35.840\n It's generals and wars and empire expansions.\n\n1:33:35.840 --> 1:33:40.720\n And so the major empires near each other never had really long periods of time where they\n\n1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:45.480\n weren't engaged in war or preparation for war or something like that was \u2013 humans\n\n1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:51.060\n don't have a good precedent in the post tribal phase, the civilization phase of being able\n\n1:33:51.060 --> 1:33:54.720\n to solve conflicts without war for very long.\n\n1:33:54.720 --> 1:34:00.920\n World War II was the first time where we could have a war that no one could win.\n\n1:34:00.920 --> 1:34:02.880\n And so the superpowers couldn't fight again.\n\n1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:04.320\n They couldn't do a real kinetic war.\n\n1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:08.600\n They could do diplomatic wars and Cold War type stuff and they could fight proxy wars\n\n1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:11.400\n through other countries that didn't have the big weapons.\n\n1:34:11.400 --> 1:34:15.920\n And so mutually assured destruction and like coming out of World War II, we actually realized\n\n1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:19.680\n that nation states couldn't prevent world war.\n\n1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:23.920\n And so we needed a new type of supervening government in addition to nation states, which\n\n1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:31.120\n was the whole Bretton Woods world, the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF, the globalization\n\n1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.240\n trade type agreements, mutually assured destruction that was how do we have some coordination\n\n1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:42.280\n beyond just nation states between them since we have to stop war between at least the superpowers.\n\n1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:48.040\n And it was pretty successful given that we've had like 75 years of no superpower on superpower\n\n1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.920\n war.\n\n1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:53.040\n We've had lots of proxy wars during that time.\n\n1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:56.000\n We've had Cold War.\n\n1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:01.840\n And I would say we're in a new phase now where the Bretton Woods solution is basically over\n\n1:35:01.840 --> 1:35:02.840\n or almost over.\n\n1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:05.160\n Can you describe the Bretton Woods solution?\n\n1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:06.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:06.160 --> 1:35:15.320\n So the Bretton Woods, the series of agreements for how the nations would be able to engage\n\n1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:21.960\n with each other in a solution other than war was these IGOs, these intergovernmental organizations\n\n1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.960\n and was the idea of globalization.\n\n1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:28.160\n Since we could have global effects, we needed to be able to think about things globally\n\n1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:32.480\n where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable to\n\n1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:33.480\n war with each other.\n\n1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:35.880\n It'd be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other.\n\n1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:42.480\n So our own self interest was gonna drive our non war interest.\n\n1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:47.200\n And so this started to look like, and obviously this couldn't have happened that much earlier\n\n1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.200\n either because industrialization hadn't gotten far enough to be able to do massive global\n\n1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:54.800\n industrial supply chains and ship stuff around quickly.\n\n1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:59.040\n But like we were mentioning earlier, almost all the electronics that we use today, just\n\n1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:02.920\n basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents, made in many countries.\n\n1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:06.080\n There's no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that\n\n1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:12.760\n we have and from the raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the et cetera.\n\n1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:18.240\n And so the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive\n\n1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:22.360\n GDP growth, we could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow\n\n1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:23.920\n stuff.\n\n1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.320\n With the rapid GDP growth, there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without\n\n1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:30.980\n having to take each other's stuff.\n\n1:36:30.980 --> 1:36:35.520\n And so that was part of kind of the Bretton Woods post World War II model.\n\n1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:38.920\n The other was that we'd be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up\n\n1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:41.100\n would never make sense.\n\n1:36:41.100 --> 1:36:43.600\n That worked for a while.\n\n1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:51.560\n Now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster, the unrenewable use of resource and\n\n1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:56.680\n turning those resources into pollution on the other side of the supply chain.\n\n1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:02.840\n So obviously that faster GDP growth meant the overfishing of the oceans and the cutting\n\n1:37:02.840 --> 1:37:08.400\n down of the trees and the climate change and the mining, toxic mining tailings going into\n\n1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:11.880\n the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things.\n\n1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:15.600\n That's the overconsumption side of the risk that we're talking about.\n\n1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:23.700\n And so the answer of let's do positive GDP is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously\n\n1:37:23.700 --> 1:37:27.280\n accelerated the planetary boundary side.\n\n1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:31.480\n And that started to be, that was thought about for a long time, but it started to be modeled\n\n1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:38.080\n with the Club of Rome and limits of growth.\n\n1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.240\n But it's just very obvious to say if you have a linear materials economy where you take\n\n1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:47.280\n stuff out of the earth faster, whether it's fish or trees or oil, you take it out of the\n\n1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:52.360\n earth faster than it can replenish itself and you turn it into trash after using it\n\n1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.120\n for a short period of time, you put the trash in the environment faster than it can process\n\n1:37:56.120 --> 1:37:59.960\n itself and there's toxicity associated with both sides of this.\n\n1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:05.160\n You can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever.\n\n1:38:05.160 --> 1:38:07.020\n That's not a hard thing to figure out.\n\n1:38:07.020 --> 1:38:11.900\n And it has to be exponential if there's an exponentiation in the monetary supply because\n\n1:38:11.900 --> 1:38:16.500\n of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to keep up with the growing\n\n1:38:16.500 --> 1:38:19.380\n monetary supply, you have to have growth of goods and services.\n\n1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:24.740\n So that's that kind of thing that has happened.\n\n1:38:24.740 --> 1:38:28.400\n But you also see that when you get these supply chains that are so interconnected across the\n\n1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:33.220\n world, you get increased fragility because a collapse or a problem in one area then affects\n\n1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:37.560\n the whole world in a much bigger area as opposed to the issues being local, right?\n\n1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:43.200\n So we got to see with COVID and an issue that started in one part of China affecting the\n\n1:38:43.200 --> 1:38:48.920\n whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened before Bretton Woods, right?\n\n1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:52.760\n Before international travel, supply chains, you know, that whole kind of thing and with\n\n1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:55.520\n a bunch of second and third order effects that people wouldn't have predicted, okay,\n\n1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:01.940\n we have to stop certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants, but the countries doing\n\n1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:06.000\n agriculture depend upon fertilizer they don't produce that is shipped into them and depend\n\n1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:07.440\n upon pesticides they don't produce.\n\n1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:12.640\n So we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in Northern Africa\n\n1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:15.400\n and Iran and things like that because they couldn't get the supplies of stuff in.\n\n1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:21.020\n So then you get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain\n\n1:39:21.020 --> 1:39:22.060\n shutdowns.\n\n1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:26.440\n So you get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can end up\n\n1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:29.420\n leading to cascade effects.\n\n1:39:29.420 --> 1:39:40.360\n And also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon to now that same catastrophe\n\n1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:46.980\n weapon is there's more countries that have it, eight or nine countries that have it,\n\n1:39:46.980 --> 1:39:50.320\n and there's a lot more types of catastrophe weapons.\n\n1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:54.980\n We now have catastrophe weapons with weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets\n\n1:39:54.980 --> 1:39:59.800\n with bio, with in fact every new type of tech has created an arms race.\n\n1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:04.500\n So we have not with the UN or the other kind of intergovernmental organizations, we haven't\n\n1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:07.680\n been able to really do nuclear de proliferation.\n\n1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:12.140\n We've actually had more countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes, the race to\n\n1:40:12.140 --> 1:40:15.260\n hypersonics and things like that.\n\n1:40:15.260 --> 1:40:20.020\n And every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race.\n\n1:40:20.020 --> 1:40:25.580\n And so you can't do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with\n\n1:40:25.580 --> 1:40:26.840\n two agents.\n\n1:40:26.840 --> 1:40:31.700\n Two agents, it's much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that's forced.\n\n1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:33.980\n But the ability to monitor and say if these guys shoot, who do I shoot?\n\n1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:34.980\n Do I shoot them?\n\n1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:35.980\n Do I shoot everybody?\n\n1:40:35.980 --> 1:40:36.980\n Do I?\n\n1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:37.980\n And so you get a three body problem.\n\n1:40:37.980 --> 1:40:41.500\n You get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple agents and multiple different\n\n1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:45.620\n types of catastrophe weapons, including ones that can be much more easily produced than\n\n1:40:45.620 --> 1:40:46.620\n nukes.\n\n1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:47.620\n Nukes are really hard to produce.\n\n1:40:47.620 --> 1:40:48.620\n There's only uranium in a few areas.\n\n1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:54.580\n uranium enrichment is hard, ICBMs are hard, but weaponized drones hitting smart targets\n\n1:40:54.580 --> 1:40:55.580\n is not so hard.\n\n1:40:55.580 --> 1:40:58.880\n There's a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture them\n\n1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:02.860\n is going way, way down to where even non state actors can have them.\n\n1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:09.600\n And so when we talk about exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech,\n\n1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:14.400\n what that means is decentralized catastrophe weapon capacity.\n\n1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:19.400\n And especially in a world of increasing numbers of people feeling disenfranchised, frantic,\n\n1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:21.460\n whatever for different reasons.\n\n1:41:21.460 --> 1:41:27.540\n So I would say where the Bretton Woods world doesn't prepare us to be able to deal with\n\n1:41:27.540 --> 1:41:31.900\n lots of different agents, having lots of different types of catastrophe weapons you can't put\n\n1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:37.860\n mutually assured destruction on, where you can't keep doing growth of materials economy\n\n1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:43.220\n in the same way because of hitting planetary boundaries and where the fragility dynamics\n\n1:41:43.220 --> 1:41:46.180\n are actually now their own source of catastrophic risk.\n\n1:41:46.180 --> 1:41:50.220\n So now we're, so like there was all the world until world war II and world war II is just\n\n1:41:50.220 --> 1:41:54.020\n from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago.\n\n1:41:54.020 --> 1:41:56.720\n It seems like a long time, but it is really not.\n\n1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:00.280\n We get a short period of relative peace at the level of superpowers while building up\n\n1:42:00.280 --> 1:42:04.540\n the military capacity for much, much, much worse war the entire time.\n\n1:42:04.540 --> 1:42:09.420\n And then now we're at this new phase where the things that allowed us to make it through\n\n1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:13.620\n the nuclear power are not the same systems that will let us make it through the next\n\n1:42:13.620 --> 1:42:14.740\n stage.\n\n1:42:14.740 --> 1:42:18.220\n So what is this next post Bretton Woods?\n\n1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:26.140\n How do we become safe vessels, safe stewards of many different types of exponential technology\n\n1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:30.140\n is a key question when we're thinking about X risk.\n\n1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:31.140\n Okay.\n\n1:42:31.140 --> 1:42:41.660\n And I'd like to try to answer the how a few ways, but first on the mutually assured destruction.\n\n1:42:41.660 --> 1:42:49.700\n Do you give credit to the idea of two superpowers now blowing each other up with nuclear weapons\n\n1:42:49.700 --> 1:42:54.900\n to the simple game theoretic model of mutually assured destruction or something you've said\n\n1:42:54.900 --> 1:43:04.780\n previously this idea of inverse correlation, which I tend to believe between the, now you\n\n1:43:04.780 --> 1:43:09.660\n were talking about tech, but I think it's maybe broadly true.\n\n1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:14.020\n The inverse correlation between competence and propensity for destruction.\n\n1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:22.140\n So the better, the, the, the bigger your weapons, not because you're afraid of a mutually assured\n\n1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:27.980\n self destruction, but because we're human beings and there's a deep moral fortitude\n\n1:43:27.980 --> 1:43:32.820\n there that somehow aligned with competence and being good at your job that like, it's\n\n1:43:32.820 --> 1:43:42.340\n very hard to be a psychopath and be good at killing at scale.\n\n1:43:42.340 --> 1:43:46.740\n Do you share any of that intuition?\n\n1:43:46.740 --> 1:43:48.700\n Kind of.\n\n1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:53.380\n I think most people would say that Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan and Napoleon were\n\n1:43:53.380 --> 1:44:01.580\n effective people that were good at their job that were actually maybe asymmetrically good\n\n1:44:01.580 --> 1:44:08.400\n at being able to organize people and do certain kinds of things that were pretty oriented\n\n1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:13.860\n towards certain types of destruction or pretty willing to, maybe they would say they were\n\n1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:18.240\n oriented towards empire expansion, but pretty willing to commit certain acts of destruction\n\n1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:19.780\n in the name of it.\n\n1:44:19.780 --> 1:44:20.780\n What are you worried about?\n\n1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:27.860\n The Genghis Khan, or you could argue he's not a psychopath.\n\n1:44:27.860 --> 1:44:31.820\n That are you worried about Genghis Khan, are you worried about Hitler or are you worried\n\n1:44:31.820 --> 1:44:42.240\n about a terrorist who is, has a very different ethic, which is not even for, it's not trying\n\n1:44:42.240 --> 1:44:46.740\n to preserve and build and expand my community.\n\n1:44:46.740 --> 1:44:50.460\n It's more about just the destruction in itself is the goal.\n\n1:44:50.460 --> 1:44:56.780\n I think the thing that you're looking at that I do agree with is that there's a psychological\n\n1:44:56.780 --> 1:45:03.020\n disposition towards construction and a psychological disposition more towards destruction.\n\n1:45:03.020 --> 1:45:07.740\n Obviously everybody has both and can toggle between both and oftentimes one is willing\n\n1:45:07.740 --> 1:45:09.100\n to destroy certain things.\n\n1:45:09.100 --> 1:45:11.020\n We have this idea of creative destruction, right?\n\n1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:15.860\n Willing to destroy certain things to create other things and utilitarianism and trolley\n\n1:45:15.860 --> 1:45:20.660\n problems are all about exploring that space and the idea of war is all about that.\n\n1:45:20.660 --> 1:45:29.260\n I am trying to create something for our people and it requires destroying some other people.\n\n1:45:29.260 --> 1:45:32.880\n Sociopathy is a funny topic because it's possible to have very high fealty to your in group\n\n1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:38.380\n and work on perfecting the methods of torture to the out group at the same time because\n\n1:45:38.380 --> 1:45:43.420\n you can dehumanize and then remove empathy.\n\n1:45:43.420 --> 1:45:48.340\n And I would also say that there are types.\n\n1:45:48.340 --> 1:45:55.160\n So the reason, the thing that gives hope about the orientation towards construction and destruction\n\n1:45:55.160 --> 1:46:00.300\n being a little different in psychology is what it takes to build really catastrophic\n\n1:46:00.300 --> 1:46:04.760\n tech, even today where it doesn't take what it took to make a nuke, a small group of people\n\n1:46:04.760 --> 1:46:10.660\n could do it, takes still some real technical knowledge that required having studied for\n\n1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:16.940\n a while and some then building capacity and there's a question of is that psychologically\n\n1:46:16.940 --> 1:46:24.340\n inversely correlated with the desire to damage civilization meaningfully?\n\n1:46:24.340 --> 1:46:25.340\n A little bit.\n\n1:46:25.340 --> 1:46:27.980\n A little bit, I think.\n\n1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:29.100\n I think a lot.\n\n1:46:29.100 --> 1:46:34.100\n I think it's actually, I mean, this is the conversation I had like with, I think offline\n\n1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:41.460\n with Dan Carlin, which is like, it's pretty easy to come up with ways that any competent,\n\n1:46:41.460 --> 1:46:46.460\n I can come up with a lot of ways to hurt a lot of people and it's pretty easy, like I\n\n1:46:46.460 --> 1:46:55.740\n alone could do it and there's a lot of people as smart or smarter than me, at least in their\n\n1:46:55.740 --> 1:46:58.120\n creation of explosives.\n\n1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:03.420\n Why are we not seeing more insane mass murder?\n\n1:47:03.420 --> 1:47:10.500\n I think there's something fascinating and beautiful about this and it does have to do\n\n1:47:10.500 --> 1:47:19.500\n with some deeply pro social types of characteristics in humans but when you're dealing with very\n\n1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:24.260\n large numbers, you don't need a whole lot of a phenomena and so then you start to say,\n\n1:47:24.260 --> 1:47:27.700\n well, what's the probability that X won't happen this year, then won't happen in the\n\n1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:32.480\n next two years, three years, four years and then how many people are doing destructive\n\n1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:36.340\n things with lower tech and then how many of them can get access to higher tech that they\n\n1:47:36.340 --> 1:47:39.100\n didn't have to figure out how to build.\n\n1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:47.180\n So when I can get commercial tech and maybe I don't understand tech very well but I understand\n\n1:47:47.180 --> 1:47:51.460\n it well enough to utilize it, not to create it and I can repurpose it.\n\n1:47:51.460 --> 1:47:57.780\n When we saw that commercial drone with a homemade thermite bomb hit the Ukrainian munitions\n\n1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:03.860\n factory and do the equivalent of an incendiary bomb level of damage, that was just home tech,\n\n1:48:03.860 --> 1:48:06.560\n that's just simple kind of thing.\n\n1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:14.020\n And so the question is not does it stay being a small percentage of the population?\n\n1:48:14.020 --> 1:48:24.140\n The question is can you bind that phenomena nearly completely and especially now as you\n\n1:48:24.140 --> 1:48:29.140\n start to get into bigger things, CRISPR gene drive technologies and various things like\n\n1:48:29.140 --> 1:48:36.020\n that, can you bind it completely long term over what period of time?\n\n1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:38.100\n Not perfectly though, that's the thing.\n\n1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:46.100\n I'm trying to say that there is some, let's call it, that's a random word, love, that's\n\n1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:54.220\n inherent and that's core to human nature that's preventing destruction at scale.\n\n1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.740\n And you're saying yeah but there's a lot of humans, there's going to be eight plus billion\n\n1:48:59.740 --> 1:49:03.620\n and then there's a lot of seconds in the day to come up with stuff, there's a lot of pain\n\n1:49:03.620 --> 1:49:08.580\n in the world that can lead to a distorted view of the world such that you want to channel\n\n1:49:08.580 --> 1:49:12.780\n that pain into the destruction, all those kinds of things and it's only a matter of\n\n1:49:12.780 --> 1:49:19.020\n time that any one individual can do large damage, especially as we create more and more\n\n1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:23.420\n democratized decentralized ways to deliver that damage even if you don't know how to\n\n1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:25.860\n build the initial weapon.\n\n1:49:25.860 --> 1:49:37.180\n But the thing is it seems like it's a race between the cheapening of destructive weapons\n\n1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:44.740\n and the capacity of humans to express their love towards each other and it's a race that\n\n1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:52.020\n so far, I know on Twitter it's not popular to say but love is winning, okay?\n\n1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:58.060\n So what is the argument that love is going to lose here against nuclear weapons and biotech\n\n1:49:58.060 --> 1:50:02.380\n and AI and drones?\n\n1:50:02.380 --> 1:50:07.940\n Okay I'm going to comment the end of this to a how love wins so I just want you to know\n\n1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:09.660\n that that's where I'm oriented.\n\n1:50:09.660 --> 1:50:10.660\n That's the end, okay.\n\n1:50:10.660 --> 1:50:19.300\n But I'm going to argue against why that is a given because it's not a given, I don't\n\n1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:20.860\n believe and I think that it's\u2026\n\n1:50:20.860 --> 1:50:25.420\n This is like a good romantic comedy so you're going to create drama right now but it will\n\n1:50:25.420 --> 1:50:27.060\n end in a happy ending.\n\n1:50:27.060 --> 1:50:30.420\n Well it's because it's only a happy ending if we actually understand the issues well\n\n1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:32.580\n enough and take responsibility to shift it.\n\n1:50:32.580 --> 1:50:37.500\n Do I believe like there's a reason why there's so much more dystopic sci fi than protopic\n\n1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:45.960\n sci fi and the some protopic sci fi usually requires magic is because \u2013 or at least\n\n1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:51.900\n magical tech, right, dilithium crystals and warp drives and stuff because it's very hard\n\n1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:59.420\n to imagine people like the people we have been in the history books with exponential\n\n1:50:59.420 --> 1:51:04.940\n type technology and power that don't eventually blow themselves up, that make good enough\n\n1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:09.820\n choices as stewards of their environment and their commons and each other and etc.\n\n1:51:09.820 --> 1:51:13.500\n So like it's easier to think of scenarios where we blow ourselves up than it is to think\n\n1:51:13.500 --> 1:51:16.460\n of scenarios where we avoid every single scenario where we blow ourselves up.\n\n1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:21.800\n And when I say blow ourselves up I mean the environmental versions, the terrorist versions,\n\n1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:25.260\n the war versions, the cumulative externalities versions.\n\n1:51:25.260 --> 1:51:33.740\n And I'm sorry if I'm interrupting your flow of thought but why is it easier?\n\n1:51:33.740 --> 1:51:39.060\n Could it be a weird psychological thing where we either are just more capable to visualize\n\n1:51:39.060 --> 1:51:44.580\n explosions and destruction and then the sicker thought which is like we kind of enjoy for\n\n1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:48.900\n some weird reason thinking about that kind of stuff even though we wouldn't actually\n\n1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:49.900\n act on it.\n\n1:51:49.900 --> 1:51:56.300\n It's almost like some weird, like I love playing shooter games, you know, first person shooters\n\n1:51:56.300 --> 1:52:01.420\n and like especially if it's like murdering zombies and doom, you're shooting demons.\n\n1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:05.980\n I play one of my favorite games Diablo is like slashing through different monsters and\n\n1:52:05.980 --> 1:52:11.320\n the screaming and pain and the hellfire and then I go out into the real world to eat my\n\n1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:13.480\n coconut ice cream and I'm all about love.\n\n1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:20.940\n So like can we trust our ability to visualize how it all goes to shit as an actual rational\n\n1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:22.620\n way of thinking?\n\n1:52:22.620 --> 1:52:28.740\n I think it's a fair question to say to what degree is there just kind of perverse fantasy\n\n1:52:28.740 --> 1:52:37.060\n and morbid exploration and whatever else that happens in our imagination but I don't think\n\n1:52:37.060 --> 1:52:38.060\n that's the whole of it.\n\n1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:44.500\n I think there is also a reality to the combinatorial possibility space and the difference in the\n\n1:52:44.500 --> 1:52:50.060\n probabilities that there's a lot of ways I could try to put the 70 trillion cells of\n\n1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:53.180\n your body together that don't make you.\n\n1:52:53.180 --> 1:52:55.260\n There's not that many ways I can put them together that make you.\n\n1:52:55.260 --> 1:52:58.740\n There's a lot of ways I could try to connect the organs together that make some weird kind\n\n1:52:58.740 --> 1:53:06.860\n of group of organs on a desk but that doesn't actually make a functioning human and you\n\n1:53:06.860 --> 1:53:09.900\n can kill an adult human in a second but you can't get one in a second.\n\n1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:12.700\n It takes 20 years to grow one and a lot of things happen right.\n\n1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:18.660\n I could destroy this building in a couple of minutes with demolition but it took a year\n\n1:53:18.660 --> 1:53:20.500\n or a couple of years to build it.\n\n1:53:20.500 --> 1:53:21.500\n There is \u2013\n\n1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:23.900\n Calm down, Cole.\n\n1:53:23.900 --> 1:53:25.220\n This is just an example.\n\n1:53:25.220 --> 1:53:27.900\n He doesn't mean it.\n\n1:53:27.900 --> 1:53:35.340\n There's a gradient where entropy is easier and there's a lot more ways to put a set\n\n1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:38.940\n of things together that don't work than the few that really do produce higher order\n\n1:53:38.940 --> 1:53:45.140\n synergies.\n\n1:53:45.140 --> 1:53:51.300\n When we look at a history of war and then we look at exponentially more powerful warfare,\n\n1:53:51.300 --> 1:53:54.540\n an arms race that drives that in all these directions, and when we look at a history\n\n1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:58.340\n of environmental destruction and exponentially more powerful tech that makes exponential\n\n1:53:58.340 --> 1:54:02.260\n externalities multiplied by the total number of agents that are doing it and the cumulative\n\n1:54:02.260 --> 1:54:07.580\n effects, there's a lot of ways the whole thing can break, like a lot of different ways.\n\n1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:12.020\n And for it to get ahead, it has to have none of those happen.\n\n1:54:12.020 --> 1:54:18.060\n And so there's just a probability space where it's easier to imagine that thing.\n\n1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:23.100\n So to say how do we have a protopic future, we have to say, well, one criteria must be\n\n1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:25.800\n that it avoids all of the catastrophic risks.\n\n1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.680\n So can we understand \u2013 can we inventory all the catastrophic risks?\n\n1:54:28.680 --> 1:54:32.260\n Can we inventory the patterns of human behavior that give rise to them?\n\n1:54:32.260 --> 1:54:35.100\n And could we try to solve for that?\n\n1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:39.800\n And could we have that be the essence of the social technology that we're thinking about\n\n1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:42.900\n to be able to guide, bind, and direct a new physical technology?\n\n1:54:42.900 --> 1:54:47.860\n Because so far, our physical technology \u2013 like we were talking about the Genghis Khan's\n\n1:54:47.860 --> 1:54:52.820\n like that, that obviously use certain kinds of physical technology and armaments and also\n\n1:54:52.820 --> 1:54:57.960\n social technology and unconventional warfare for a particular set of purposes.\n\n1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:04.300\n But we have things that don't look like warfare, like Rockefeller and Standard Oil.\n\n1:55:04.300 --> 1:55:11.100\n And it looked like a constructive mindset to be able to bring this new energy resource\n\n1:55:11.100 --> 1:55:14.060\n to the world, and it did.\n\n1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:21.360\n And the second order effects of that are climate change and all of the oil spills that have\n\n1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:26.820\n happened and will happen and all of the wars in the Middle East over the oil that have\n\n1:55:26.820 --> 1:55:32.540\n been there and the massive political clusterfuck and human life issues that are associated\n\n1:55:32.540 --> 1:55:36.540\n with it and on and on, right?\n\n1:55:36.540 --> 1:55:44.180\n And so it's also not just the orientation to construct a thing can have a narrow focus\n\n1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:47.900\n on what I'm trying to construct but be affecting a lot of other things through second and third\n\n1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:51.140\n order effects I'm not taking responsibility for.\n\n1:55:51.140 --> 1:55:57.300\n You often on another tangent mentioned second, third, and fourth order effects.\n\n1:55:57.300 --> 1:55:58.300\n And order.\n\n1:55:58.300 --> 1:55:59.300\n And order.\n\n1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:00.300\n Cascading.\n\n1:56:00.300 --> 1:56:02.020\n Which is really fascinating.\n\n1:56:02.020 --> 1:56:09.460\n Like starting with the third order plus it gets really interesting because we don't\n\n1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:11.940\n even acknowledge like the second order effects.\n\n1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:12.940\n Right.\n\n1:56:12.940 --> 1:56:17.540\n But like thinking because those it could get bigger and bigger and bigger in ways we were\n\n1:56:17.540 --> 1:56:18.540\n not anticipating.\n\n1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:20.200\n So how do we make those?\n\n1:56:20.200 --> 1:56:27.460\n So it sounds like part of the thing that you are thinking through in terms of a solution\n\n1:56:27.460 --> 1:56:38.540\n how to create an anti fragile, a resilient society is to make explicit acknowledge, understand\n\n1:56:38.540 --> 1:56:44.840\n the externalities, the second order, third order, fourth order, and the order effects.\n\n1:56:44.840 --> 1:56:47.020\n How do we start to think about those effects?\n\n1:56:47.020 --> 1:56:52.300\n Yeah, the war application is harm we're trying to cause or that we're aware we're causing.\n\n1:56:52.300 --> 1:56:53.300\n Right.\n\n1:56:53.300 --> 1:56:58.060\n The externality is harm that at least supposedly we're not aware we're causing or at minimum\n\n1:56:58.060 --> 1:56:59.060\n it's not our intention.\n\n1:56:59.060 --> 1:57:00.060\n Right.\n\n1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:03.340\n Maybe we're either totally unaware of it or we're aware of it but it is a side effect\n\n1:57:03.340 --> 1:57:04.580\n of what our intention is.\n\n1:57:04.580 --> 1:57:06.620\n It's not the intention itself.\n\n1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:09.020\n There are catastrophic risks from both types.\n\n1:57:09.020 --> 1:57:16.460\n The direct application of increased technological power to a rivalrous intent which is going\n\n1:57:16.460 --> 1:57:19.740\n to cause harm for some out group, for some in group to win.\n\n1:57:19.740 --> 1:57:23.500\n But the out group is also working on growing the tech and if they don't lose completely\n\n1:57:23.500 --> 1:57:27.820\n they reverse engineer the tech, up regulate it, come back with more capacity.\n\n1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:33.680\n So there's the exponential tech arms race side of in group, out group rivalry using\n\n1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:36.380\n exponential tech that is one set of risks.\n\n1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:44.480\n And the other set of risks is the application of exponentially more powerful tech not intentionally\n\n1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:49.060\n to try and beat an out group but to try to achieve some goal that we have but to produce\n\n1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:56.220\n a second and third order effects that do have harm to the commons, to other people, to environment,\n\n1:57:56.220 --> 1:58:02.660\n to other groups that might actually be bigger problems than the problem we were originally\n\n1:58:02.660 --> 1:58:05.400\n trying to solve with the thing we were building.\n\n1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:10.800\n When Facebook was building a dating app and then building a social app where people could\n\n1:58:10.800 --> 1:58:20.460\n tag pictures, they weren't trying to build a democracy destroying app that would maximize\n\n1:58:20.460 --> 1:58:27.800\n time on site as part of its ad model through AI optimization of a newsfeed to the thing\n\n1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:31.780\n that made people spend most time on site which is usually them being limbically hijacked\n\n1:58:31.780 --> 1:58:37.380\n more than something else which ends up appealing to people's cognitive biases and group identities\n\n1:58:37.380 --> 1:58:39.920\n and creates no sense of shared reality.\n\n1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:45.220\n They weren't trying to do that but it was a second order effect and it's a pretty fucking\n\n1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:51.580\n powerful second order effect and a pretty fast one because the rate of tech is obviously\n\n1:58:51.580 --> 1:58:56.900\n able to get distributed to much larger scale much faster and with a bigger jump in terms\n\n1:58:56.900 --> 1:59:00.600\n of total vertical capacity than that's what it means to get to the verticalizing part\n\n1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:02.960\n of an exponential curve.\n\n1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:09.800\n So just like we can see that oil had the second order environmental effects and also social\n\n1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:11.560\n and political effects.\n\n1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:19.100\n War and so much of the whole like the total amount of oil used has a proportionality to\n\n1:59:19.100 --> 1:59:27.960\n total global GDP and this is why we have this the petrodollar and so the oil thing also\n\n1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:32.240\n had the externalities of a major aspect of what happened with military industrial complex\n\n1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:34.740\n and things like that.\n\n1:59:34.740 --> 1:59:40.020\n But we can see the same thing with more current technologies with Facebook and Google and\n\n1:59:40.020 --> 1:59:41.140\n other things.\n\n1:59:41.140 --> 1:59:49.460\n So I don't think we can run and the more powerful the tech is, we build it for reason X, whatever\n\n1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.260\n reason X is.\n\n1:59:51.260 --> 1:59:55.180\n Maybe X is three things, maybe it's one thing, right?\n\n1:59:55.180 --> 1:59:58.860\n We're doing the oil thing because we wanna make cars because it's a better method of\n\n1:59:58.860 --> 2:00:01.980\n individual transportation, we're building the Facebook thing because we're gonna connect\n\n2:00:01.980 --> 2:00:04.680\n people socially in a personal sphere.\n\n2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:13.060\n But it interacts with complex systems, with ecologies, economies, psychologies, cultures,\n\n2:00:13.060 --> 2:00:16.620\n and so it has effects on other than the thing we're intending.\n\n2:00:16.620 --> 2:00:22.260\n Some of those effects can end up being negative effects, but because this technology, if we\n\n2:00:22.260 --> 2:00:25.900\n make it to solve a problem, it has to overcome the problem.\n\n2:00:25.900 --> 2:00:28.380\n The problem has been around for a while, it's gonna overcome in a short period of time.\n\n2:00:28.380 --> 2:00:32.660\n So it usually has greater scale, greater rate of magnitude in some way.\n\n2:00:32.660 --> 2:00:37.960\n That also means that the externalities that it creates might be bigger problems.\n\n2:00:37.960 --> 2:00:40.780\n And you can say, well, but then that's the new problem and humanity will innovate its\n\n2:00:40.780 --> 2:00:41.780\n way out of that.\n\n2:00:41.780 --> 2:00:45.700\n Well, I don't think that's paying attention to the fact that we can't keep up with exponential\n\n2:00:45.700 --> 2:00:52.640\n curves like that, nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities forever.\n\n2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:57.900\n And this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking, well, no,\n\n2:00:57.900 --> 2:01:02.580\n I think we're totally screwed unless we can make a benevolent AI singleton that rules all\n\n2:01:02.580 --> 2:01:03.580\n of us.\n\n2:01:03.580 --> 2:01:10.280\n Guys like Ostrom and others thinking in those directions, because they're like, how do humans\n\n2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:14.500\n try to do multipolarity and make it work?\n\n2:01:14.500 --> 2:01:19.100\n And I have a different answer of what I think it looks like that does have more to do with\n\n2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:22.940\n love, but some applied social tech aligned with love.\n\n2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:28.260\n That's good, because I have a bunch of really dumb ideas I'd prefer to hear.\n\n2:01:28.260 --> 2:01:30.020\n I'd like to hear some of them first.\n\n2:01:30.020 --> 2:01:37.860\n I think the idea I would have is to be a bit more rigorous in trying to measure the amount\n\n2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:46.580\n of love you add or subtract from the world in second, third, fourth, fifth order effects.\n\n2:01:46.580 --> 2:01:52.500\n It's actually, I think, especially in the world of tech, quite doable.\n\n2:01:52.500 --> 2:01:58.540\n You just might not like, the shareholders may not like that kind of metric, but it's\n\n2:01:58.540 --> 2:02:01.340\n pretty easy to measure.\n\n2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:07.940\n That's not even, I'm perhaps half joking about love, but we could talk about just happiness\n\n2:02:07.940 --> 2:02:11.140\n and well being, long term well being.\n\n2:02:11.140 --> 2:02:16.780\n That's pretty easy for Facebook, for YouTube, for all these companies to measure that.\n\n2:02:16.780 --> 2:02:19.220\n They do a lot of kinds of surveys.\n\n2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:25.060\n There's very simple solutions here that you could just survey how, I mean, servers are\n\n2:02:25.060 --> 2:02:31.340\n in some sense useless because they're a subset of the population.\n\n2:02:31.340 --> 2:02:35.100\n You're just trying to get a sense, it's very loose kind of understanding, but integrated\n\n2:02:35.100 --> 2:02:37.320\n deeply as part of the technology.\n\n2:02:37.320 --> 2:02:39.500\n Most of our tech is recommender systems.\n\n2:02:39.500 --> 2:02:46.980\n Most of the, sorry, not tech, online interactions driven by recommender systems that learn very\n\n2:02:46.980 --> 2:02:52.380\n little data about you and use that data based on, mostly based on traces of your previous\n\n2:02:52.380 --> 2:02:54.660\n behavior to suggest future things.\n\n2:02:54.660 --> 2:02:56.860\n This is how Twitter, this is how Facebook works.\n\n2:02:56.860 --> 2:03:02.980\n This is how AdSense or Google AdSense works, this is how Netflix, YouTube work and so on.\n\n2:03:02.980 --> 2:03:08.300\n And for them to just track as opposed to engagement, how much you spend in a particular video,\n\n2:03:08.300 --> 2:03:16.060\n a particular site, is also track, give you the technology to do self report of what makes\n\n2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:23.940\n you feel good, what makes you grow as a person, of what makes you, you know, the best version\n\n2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:31.100\n of yourself, the Rogan idea of the hero of your movie.\n\n2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:34.220\n And just add that little bit of information.\n\n2:03:34.220 --> 2:03:39.580\n If you have people, you have this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five\n\n2:03:39.580 --> 2:03:42.940\n days, how would you report your experience.\n\n2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:45.020\n You can lay out the set of videos.\n\n2:03:45.020 --> 2:03:48.460\n It's kind of fascinating, I don't know if you ever look at YouTube, the history of videos\n\n2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:49.460\n you've looked at.\n\n2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:50.460\n It's fascinating.\n\n2:03:50.460 --> 2:03:52.340\n It's very embarrassing for me.\n\n2:03:52.340 --> 2:03:57.740\n Like it'll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that I don't want anyone to\n\n2:03:57.740 --> 2:04:03.580\n know about, which is, which is, which will be like, I don't know, maybe like five videos\n\n2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:07.220\n in a row where it looks like I watched the whole thing, which I probably did about like\n\n2:04:07.220 --> 2:04:11.540\n how to cook a steak, even though, or just like with the best chefs in the world cooking\n\n2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:17.020\n steaks and I'm just like sitting there watching it for no purpose whatsoever, wasting away\n\n2:04:17.020 --> 2:04:23.540\n my life or like funny cat videos or like legit, that's always a good one.\n\n2:04:23.540 --> 2:04:29.460\n And I could look back and rate which videos made me a better person and not.\n\n2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:34.700\n And I mean, on a more serious note, there's a bunch of conversations, podcasts or lectures\n\n2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:40.340\n I've watched, which made me a better person and some of them made me a worse person.\n\n2:04:40.340 --> 2:04:45.820\n And honestly, not for stupid reasons, like I feel dumber, but because I do have a sense\n\n2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:54.400\n that that started me on a path of, of not being kind to other people.\n\n2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:58.740\n For example, I'll give you a, for my own, and I'm sorry for ranting, but maybe there's\n\n2:04:58.740 --> 2:05:02.580\n some usefulness to this kind of exploration of self.\n\n2:05:02.580 --> 2:05:11.640\n When I focus on creating, on programming, on science, I become a much deeper thinker\n\n2:05:11.640 --> 2:05:14.600\n and a kinder person to others.\n\n2:05:14.600 --> 2:05:20.540\n When I listen to too many, a little bit is good, but too many podcasts or videos about\n\n2:05:20.540 --> 2:05:28.340\n how, how our world is melting down or criticizing ridiculous people, the worst of the quote\n\n2:05:28.340 --> 2:05:30.060\n unquote woke, for example.\n\n2:05:30.060 --> 2:05:35.820\n All there's all these groups that are misbehaving in fascinating ways because they've been corrupted\n\n2:05:35.820 --> 2:05:37.100\n by power.\n\n2:05:37.100 --> 2:05:44.260\n The more I watch, the more I watch criticism of them, the worse I become.\n\n2:05:44.260 --> 2:05:49.240\n And I'm aware of this, but I'm also aware that for some reason it's pleasant to watch\n\n2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:51.020\n those sometimes.\n\n2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:56.440\n And so for, for me to be able to self report that to the YouTube algorithm, to the systems\n\n2:05:56.440 --> 2:06:02.220\n around me, and they ultimately try to optimize to make me the best person, the best version\n\n2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:06.460\n of myself, which I personally believe would make YouTube a lot more money because I'd\n\n2:06:06.460 --> 2:06:11.380\n be much more willing to spend time on YouTube and give YouTube a lot more, a lot more of\n\n2:06:11.380 --> 2:06:12.380\n my money.\n\n2:06:12.380 --> 2:06:17.700\n That's a, that's great for business and great for humanity because it'll make me a kinder\n\n2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:18.700\n person.\n\n2:06:18.700 --> 2:06:25.420\n It'll increase the love quotient, the love metric, and it'll make them a lot of money.\n\n2:06:25.420 --> 2:06:27.100\n I feel like everything's aligned.\n\n2:06:27.100 --> 2:06:31.980\n And so you, you should do that not just for YouTube algorithm, but also for military strategy\n\n2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:36.620\n and whether you go to war or not, because one externality you can think of about going\n\n2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:42.660\n to war, which I think we talked about offline is we often go to war with kind of governments\n\n2:06:42.660 --> 2:06:46.100\n with a, with, not with the people.\n\n2:06:46.100 --> 2:06:57.280\n You have to think about the kids of countries that see a soldier and because of what they\n\n2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:01.780\n experienced the interaction with the soldier, hate is born.\n\n2:07:01.780 --> 2:07:07.140\n When you're like eight years old, six years old, you lose your dad, you lose your mom,\n\n2:07:07.140 --> 2:07:12.180\n you lose a friend, somebody close to you that want a really powerful externality that could\n\n2:07:12.180 --> 2:07:19.500\n be reduced to love, positive and negative is the hate that's born when you make decisions.\n\n2:07:19.500 --> 2:07:25.300\n And that's going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree that\n\n2:07:25.300 --> 2:07:30.860\n then leads to the kind of destruction that we talk about.\n\n2:07:30.860 --> 2:07:35.340\n So but in my sense, it's possible to reduce everything to a measure of how much love does\n\n2:07:35.340 --> 2:07:38.700\n this add to the world.\n\n2:07:38.700 --> 2:07:48.060\n All that to say, do you have ideas of how we practically build systems that create a\n\n2:07:48.060 --> 2:07:49.060\n resilient society?\n\n2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:55.100\n There were a lot of good things that you shared where there's like 15 different ways that\n\n2:07:55.100 --> 2:07:57.180\n we could enter this that are all interesting.\n\n2:07:57.180 --> 2:08:00.020\n So I'm trying to see which one will probably be most useful.\n\n2:08:00.020 --> 2:08:03.180\n Pick the one or two things that are least ridiculous.\n\n2:08:03.180 --> 2:08:11.340\n When you were mentioning if we could see some of the second order effects or externalities\n\n2:08:11.340 --> 2:08:15.420\n that we aren't used to seeing, specifically the one of a kid being radicalized somewhere\n\n2:08:15.420 --> 2:08:20.400\n else, which engenders enmity in them towards us, which decreases our own future security.\n\n2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:24.100\n Even if you don't care about the kid, if you care about the kid, it's a whole other thing.\n\n2:08:24.100 --> 2:08:30.180\n Yeah, I mean, I think when we saw this, when Jane Fonda and others went to Vietnam and\n\n2:08:30.180 --> 2:08:34.700\n took photos and videos of what was happening, and you got to see the pictures of the kids\n\n2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:42.260\n with napalm on them, that like the antiwar effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn't\n\n2:08:42.260 --> 2:08:45.780\n have been without that.\n\n2:08:45.780 --> 2:08:50.220\n Until we can see the images, you can't have a mere neuron effect in the same way.\n\n2:08:50.220 --> 2:08:53.260\n And when you can, that starts to have a powerful effect.\n\n2:08:53.260 --> 2:09:01.980\n I think there's a deep principle that you're sharing there, which is that if we can have\n\n2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:07.660\n a rivalrous intent where our in group, whatever it is, maybe it's our political party wanting\n\n2:09:07.660 --> 2:09:13.860\n to win within the US, maybe it's our nation state wanting to win in a war or an economic\n\n2:09:13.860 --> 2:09:19.860\n war over resource or whatever it is, that if we don't obliterate the other people completely,\n\n2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:27.260\n they don't go away, they're not engendered to like us more, they didn't become less smart.\n\n2:09:27.260 --> 2:09:31.300\n So they have more enmity towards us and whatever technologies we employed to be successful,\n\n2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:35.500\n they will now reverse engineer, make iterations on and come back.\n\n2:09:35.500 --> 2:09:42.140\n And so you drive an arms race, which is why you can see that the wars were over history\n\n2:09:42.140 --> 2:09:46.020\n employing more lethal weaponry.\n\n2:09:46.020 --> 2:09:53.300\n And not just the kinetic war, the information war and the narrative war and the economic\n\n2:09:53.300 --> 2:09:58.420\n war, like it just increased capacity in all of those fronts.\n\n2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:04.300\n And so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses\n\n2:10:04.300 --> 2:10:05.460\n in the long term.\n\n2:10:05.460 --> 2:10:08.760\n And what's even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned with\n\n2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:11.020\n everyone else because we inter affect each other.\n\n2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:16.860\n And I think the thing about globalism, globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which\n\n2:10:16.860 --> 2:10:19.780\n we affect each other and the rate at which we affect the biosphere that we're all affected\n\n2:10:19.780 --> 2:10:28.240\n by is that this kind of proverbial spiritual idea that we're all interconnected and need\n\n2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:33.420\n to think about that in some way, that was easy for tribes to get because everyone in\n\n2:10:33.420 --> 2:10:37.900\n the tribes so clearly saw their interconnection and dependence on each other.\n\n2:10:37.900 --> 2:10:43.820\n But in terms of a global level, the speed at which we are actually interconnected, the\n\n2:10:43.820 --> 2:10:48.020\n speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or\n\n2:10:48.020 --> 2:10:52.320\n a new technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue\n\n2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:58.220\n or whatever is making it to where we either actually all get, not as a spiritual idea,\n\n2:10:58.220 --> 2:10:59.580\n just even as physics, right?\n\n2:10:59.580 --> 2:11:04.340\n We all get the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that and see\n\n2:11:04.340 --> 2:11:10.580\n how to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere end up becoming decreased\n\n2:11:10.580 --> 2:11:12.820\n quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere.\n\n2:11:12.820 --> 2:11:16.540\n Don't you think people are beginning to experience that at the individual level?\n\n2:11:16.540 --> 2:11:18.700\n So governments are resisting it.\n\n2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:21.780\n They're trying to make us not empathize with each other, feel connected.\n\n2:11:21.780 --> 2:11:25.060\n But don't you think people are beginning to feel more and more connected?\n\n2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:27.940\n Like isn't that exactly what the technology is enabling?\n\n2:11:27.940 --> 2:11:34.740\n Like social networks, we tend to criticize them, but isn't there a sense which we're\n\n2:11:34.740 --> 2:11:37.180\n experiencing, you know?\n\n2:11:37.180 --> 2:11:43.900\n When you watch those videos that are criticizing, whether it's the woke Antifa side or the QAnon\n\n2:11:43.900 --> 2:11:50.100\n Trump supporter side, does it seem like they have increased empathy for people that are\n\n2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:51.700\n outside of their ideologic camp?\n\n2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:52.700\n Not at all.\n\n2:11:52.700 --> 2:12:04.620\n I may be conflating my own experience of the world and that of the populace.\n\n2:12:04.620 --> 2:12:12.140\n I tend to see those videos as feeding something that's a relic of the past.\n\n2:12:12.140 --> 2:12:19.540\n They figured out that drama fuels clicks, but whether I'm right or wrong, I don't know.\n\n2:12:19.540 --> 2:12:26.300\n But I tend to sense that that is not, that hunger for drama is not fundamental to human\n\n2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:34.860\n beings that we want to actually, that we want to understand Antifa and we want to empathize.\n\n2:12:34.860 --> 2:12:41.820\n We want to take radical ideas and be able to empathize with them and synthesize it all.\n\n2:12:41.820 --> 2:12:51.980\n Okay, let's look at cultural outliers in terms of violence versus compassion.\n\n2:12:51.980 --> 2:12:58.020\n We can see that a lot of cultures have relatively lower in group violence, bigger out group\n\n2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:01.500\n violence, and there's some variance in them and variance at different times based on the\n\n2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:04.660\n scarcity or abundance of resource and other things.\n\n2:13:04.660 --> 2:13:12.180\n But you can look at say, Janes, whose whole religion is around nonviolence so much so\n\n2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:16.860\n that they don't even hurt plants, they only take fruits that fall off them and stuff.\n\n2:13:16.860 --> 2:13:21.340\n Or to go to a larger population, you could take Buddhists, where for the most part, with\n\n2:13:21.340 --> 2:13:25.780\n a few exceptions, for the most part across three millennia and across lots of different\n\n2:13:25.780 --> 2:13:30.620\n countries and geographies and whatever, you have 10 million people plus or minus who don't\n\n2:13:30.620 --> 2:13:33.100\n hurt bugs.\n\n2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:36.420\n The whole spectrum of genetic variance that is happening within a culture of that many\n\n2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:41.980\n people and head traumas and whatever, and nobody hurts bugs.\n\n2:13:41.980 --> 2:13:47.580\n And then you look at a group where the kids grew up as child soldiers in Liberia or Darfur\n\n2:13:47.580 --> 2:13:51.700\n were to make it to adulthood, pretty much everybody's killed people hand to hand and\n\n2:13:51.700 --> 2:13:54.860\n killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people.\n\n2:13:54.860 --> 2:14:00.260\n And you say, okay, so we were very neotenous, we can be conditioned by our environment and\n\n2:14:00.260 --> 2:14:05.660\n humans can be conditioned where almost all the humans show up in these two different\n\n2:14:05.660 --> 2:14:06.660\n bell curves.\n\n2:14:06.660 --> 2:14:08.980\n It doesn't mean that the Buddhists had no violence, it doesn't mean that these people\n\n2:14:08.980 --> 2:14:14.460\n had no compassion, but they're very different Gaussian distributions.\n\n2:14:14.460 --> 2:14:20.460\n And so I think one of the important things that I like to do is look at the examples\n\n2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:28.860\n of the populations, what Buddhism shows regarding compassion or what Judaism shows around education,\n\n2:14:28.860 --> 2:14:32.460\n the average level of education that everybody gets because of a culture that is really working\n\n2:14:32.460 --> 2:14:35.500\n on conditioning it or various cultures.\n\n2:14:35.500 --> 2:14:41.680\n What are the positive deviance outside of the statistical deviance to see what is actually\n\n2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:47.060\n possible and then say, what are the conditioning factors and can we condition those across\n\n2:14:47.060 --> 2:14:52.020\n a few of them simultaneously and could we build a civilization like that becomes a very\n\n2:14:52.020 --> 2:14:53.500\n interesting question.\n\n2:14:53.500 --> 2:14:59.340\n So there's this kind of real politic idea that humans are violent, large groups of humans\n\n2:14:59.340 --> 2:15:03.900\n become violent, they become irrational, specifically those two things, rivalrous and violent and\n\n2:15:03.900 --> 2:15:05.180\n irrational.\n\n2:15:05.180 --> 2:15:08.980\n And so in order to minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions,\n\n2:15:08.980 --> 2:15:10.780\n they need ruled somehow.\n\n2:15:10.780 --> 2:15:15.400\n And that not getting that is some kind of naive utopianism that doesn't understand human\n\n2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:16.400\n nature yet.\n\n2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:20.140\n This gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing.\n\n2:15:20.140 --> 2:15:26.560\n I think the idea of the masses is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the\n\n2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:37.380\n classes that control to popularize the idea that most people are too violent, lazy, undisciplined\n\n2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:42.300\n and irrational to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some\n\n2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:43.300\n kind of way.\n\n2:15:43.300 --> 2:15:50.060\n I think that if we look back at these conditioning environments, we can say, okay, so the kids\n\n2:15:50.060 --> 2:15:58.260\n that go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like Exeter\n\n2:15:58.260 --> 2:16:03.540\n Academy, there's still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric,\n\n2:16:03.540 --> 2:16:09.300\n but on average, they become senators and the worst ones become high end lawyers or whatever.\n\n2:16:09.300 --> 2:16:12.340\n And then I look at the inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see\n\n2:16:12.340 --> 2:16:15.500\n a very, very differently displaced Gaussian distribution, but a very different set of\n\n2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:16.500\n conditioning factors.\n\n2:16:16.500 --> 2:16:20.380\n And then I say the masses, well, if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses\n\n2:16:20.380 --> 2:16:25.140\n got to go to Exeter and have that family and whatever, would they still be the masses?\n\n2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:32.140\n Could we actually condition more social virtue, more civic virtue, more orientation towards\n\n2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:37.580\n dialectical synthesis, more empathy, more rationality widely?\n\n2:16:37.580 --> 2:16:39.940\n Yes.\n\n2:16:39.940 --> 2:16:45.180\n Would that lead to better capacity for something like participatory governance, democracy or\n\n2:16:45.180 --> 2:16:47.940\n republic or some kind of participatory governance?\n\n2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:48.940\n Yes.\n\n2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:49.940\n Yes.\n\n2:16:49.940 --> 2:16:52.500\n Is it necessary for it actually?\n\n2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:54.060\n Yes.\n\n2:16:54.060 --> 2:16:57.580\n And is it good for class interests?\n\n2:16:57.580 --> 2:16:58.580\n Not really.\n\n2:16:58.580 --> 2:17:03.540\n By the way, when you say class interests, this is the powerful leading over the less\n\n2:17:03.540 --> 2:17:06.800\n powerful, that kind of idea.\n\n2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:12.780\n Anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power doesn't necessarily benefit from decreasing\n\n2:17:12.780 --> 2:17:20.340\n those asymmetries of power and kind of increasing the capacity of people more widely.\n\n2:17:20.340 --> 2:17:28.100\n And so, when we talk about power, we're talking about asymmetries in agency, influence and\n\n2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:29.100\n control.\n\n2:17:29.100 --> 2:17:33.180\n Do you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature?\n\n2:17:33.180 --> 2:17:36.020\n I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff.\n\n2:17:36.020 --> 2:17:43.440\n So like this pick up line that I use at a bar often, which is power corrupts and absolute\n\n2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:45.560\n power corrupts, absolutely.\n\n2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:48.760\n Is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say?\n\n2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:55.080\n In modern society, there's something to be said, have we changed as societies over time\n\n2:17:55.080 --> 2:17:58.100\n in terms of how much we crave power?\n\n2:17:58.100 --> 2:18:03.260\n That there is an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned\n\n2:18:03.260 --> 2:18:06.840\n one way or the other, yes, but you can see that Buddhist society does a very different\n\n2:18:06.840 --> 2:18:13.100\n thing with it at scale, that you don't end up seeing the emergence of the same types\n\n2:18:13.100 --> 2:18:21.460\n of sociopathic behavior and particularly then creating sociopathic institutions.\n\n2:18:21.460 --> 2:18:28.220\n And so, it's like, is eating the foods that were rare in our evolutionary environment\n\n2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:31.820\n that give us more dopamine hit because they were rare and they're not anymore, salt,\n\n2:18:31.820 --> 2:18:33.220\n sugar?\n\n2:18:33.220 --> 2:18:37.560\n Is there something pleasurable about those where humans have an orientation to overeat\n\n2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:38.560\n if they can?\n\n2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:42.740\n Well, the fact that there is that possibility doesn't mean everyone will obligately be obese\n\n2:18:42.740 --> 2:18:44.020\n and die of obesity, right?\n\n2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:49.900\n Like it's possible to have a particular impulse and to be able to understand it, have other\n\n2:18:49.900 --> 2:18:52.780\n ones and be able to balance them.\n\n2:18:52.780 --> 2:19:00.460\n And so, to say that power dynamics are obligate in humans and we can't do anything about it\n\n2:19:00.460 --> 2:19:05.460\n is very similar to me to saying like everyone is going to be obligately obese.\n\n2:19:05.460 --> 2:19:06.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:06.460 --> 2:19:10.640\n So, there's some degree to which the control of those impulses has to do with the conditioning\n\n2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:11.640\n early in life.\n\n2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:12.640\n Yes.\n\n2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:16.940\n And the culture that creates the environment to be able to do that and then the recursion\n\n2:19:16.940 --> 2:19:17.940\n on that.\n\n2:19:17.940 --> 2:19:18.940\n Okay.\n\n2:19:18.940 --> 2:19:24.060\n So, if we were to, bear with me, just asking for a friend, if we're to kill all humans\n\n2:19:24.060 --> 2:19:32.740\n on Earth and then start over, is there ideas about how to build up, okay, we don't have\n\n2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:38.220\n to kill, let's leave the humans on Earth, they're fine and go to Mars and start a new\n\n2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:39.220\n society.\n\n2:19:39.220 --> 2:19:47.340\n Is there ways to construct systems of conditioning, education of how we live with each other that\n\n2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:57.980\n would incentivize us properly to not seek power, to not construct systems that are of\n\n2:19:57.980 --> 2:20:03.460\n asymmetry of power and to create systems that are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks,\n\n2:20:03.460 --> 2:20:06.540\n to all kinds of destructions?\n\n2:20:06.540 --> 2:20:08.460\n I believe so.\n\n2:20:08.460 --> 2:20:10.300\n Is there some inclination?\n\n2:20:10.300 --> 2:20:14.620\n Of course, you probably don't have all the answers, but you have insights about what\n\n2:20:14.620 --> 2:20:15.620\n that looks like.\n\n2:20:15.620 --> 2:20:16.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:16.620 --> 2:20:23.380\n It's just rigorous practice of dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes\n\n2:20:23.380 --> 2:20:28.420\n of various flavors until they're not assholes anymore because you become deeply empathetic\n\n2:20:28.420 --> 2:20:29.420\n with their experience.\n\n2:20:29.420 --> 2:20:30.420\n Okay.\n\n2:20:30.420 --> 2:20:37.620\n So, there's a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to this, like\n\n2:20:37.620 --> 2:20:39.700\n what is the basis of rivalry?\n\n2:20:39.700 --> 2:20:41.020\n How do you bind it?\n\n2:20:41.020 --> 2:20:43.460\n How does it relate to tech?\n\n2:20:43.460 --> 2:20:48.180\n If you have a culture that is doing less rivalry, does it always lose in war to those who do\n\n2:20:48.180 --> 2:20:49.180\n war better?\n\n2:20:49.180 --> 2:20:52.460\n And how do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here?\n\n2:20:52.460 --> 2:20:53.700\n Great, great.\n\n2:20:53.700 --> 2:20:54.700\n So what's rivalry?\n\n2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:58.980\n Well, is rivalry bad or good?\n\n2:20:58.980 --> 2:21:01.980\n So is another word for rivalry competition?\n\n2:21:01.980 --> 2:21:05.380\n Yes, I think roughly, yes.\n\n2:21:05.380 --> 2:21:10.640\n I think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here.\n\n2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:12.700\n Good for some things, bad for other things.\n\n2:21:12.700 --> 2:21:15.820\n Bad for some contexts and others.\n\n2:21:15.820 --> 2:21:16.820\n Even that.\n\n2:21:16.820 --> 2:21:17.820\n Okay.\n\n2:21:17.820 --> 2:21:21.700\n Let me give you an example that relates back to the Facebook measuring thing you were mentioning\n\n2:21:21.700 --> 2:21:23.300\n a moment ago.\n\n2:21:23.300 --> 2:21:27.580\n First, I think what you're saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what\n\n2:21:27.580 --> 2:21:32.300\n I want to get to in a moment, but it's not, the devil is in the details here.\n\n2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.720\n So I enjoy praise, it feeds my ego, I grow stronger.\n\n2:21:36.720 --> 2:21:37.720\n So I appreciate that.\n\n2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:42.420\n I will make sure to include one piece every 15 minutes as we go.\n\n2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:53.860\n So it's easier to measure, there are problems with this argument, but there's also utility\n\n2:21:53.860 --> 2:21:54.860\n to it.\n\n2:21:54.860 --> 2:21:59.340\n So let's take it for the utility it has first.\n\n2:21:59.340 --> 2:22:04.960\n It's harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort.\n\n2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:10.780\n We can measure with technology that the shocks in a car are making the car bounce less, that\n\n2:22:10.780 --> 2:22:16.340\n the bed is softer and, you know, material science and those types of things.\n\n2:22:16.340 --> 2:22:23.180\n And happiness is actually hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there's\n\n2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:26.220\n certain kinds of overcoming suffering that are necessary for happiness.\n\n2:22:26.220 --> 2:22:30.180\n There's happiness that feels more like contentment and happiness that feels more like passion.\n\n2:22:30.180 --> 2:22:32.780\n Is passion the source of all suffering or the source of all creativity?\n\n2:22:32.780 --> 2:22:37.380\n Like there's deep stuff and it's mostly first person, not measurable third person stuff,\n\n2:22:37.380 --> 2:22:40.860\n even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to some degree.\n\n2:22:40.860 --> 2:22:45.260\n But we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the worst environments\n\n2:22:45.260 --> 2:22:49.100\n who end up finding happiness, right, where the third person stuff looks to be less conducive\n\n2:22:49.100 --> 2:22:54.420\n and there's some Victor Frankl, Nelson Mandela, whatever.\n\n2:22:54.420 --> 2:22:57.540\n But it's pretty easy to measure comfort and it's pretty universal.\n\n2:22:57.540 --> 2:23:01.760\n And I think we can see that the Industrial Revolution started to replace happiness with\n\n2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:05.260\n comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for.\n\n2:23:05.260 --> 2:23:09.020\n And we can see that when increased comfort is given, maybe because of the evolutionary\n\n2:23:09.020 --> 2:23:14.400\n disposition that expending extra calories when for the majority of our history we didn't\n\n2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:17.420\n have extra calories was not a safe thing to do.\n\n2:23:17.420 --> 2:23:19.660\n Who knows why?\n\n2:23:19.660 --> 2:23:25.820\n When extra comfort is given, it's very easy to take that path, even if it's not the path\n\n2:23:25.820 --> 2:23:29.220\n that supports overall well being long term.\n\n2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:37.500\n And so, we can see that, you know, when you look at the techno optimist idea that we have\n\n2:23:37.500 --> 2:23:41.780\n better lives than Egyptian pharaohs and kings and whatever, what they're largely looking\n\n2:23:41.780 --> 2:23:47.980\n at is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable the transportation systems are\n\n2:23:47.980 --> 2:23:50.340\n and things like that, in which case there's massive improvement.\n\n2:23:50.340 --> 2:23:54.700\n But we also see that in some of the nations where people have access to the most comfort,\n\n2:23:54.700 --> 2:23:57.500\n suicide and mental illness are the highest.\n\n2:23:57.500 --> 2:24:01.420\n And we also see that some of the happiest cultures are actually some of the ones that\n\n2:24:01.420 --> 2:24:04.220\n are in materially lame environments.\n\n2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:08.260\n And so, there's a very interesting question here, and if I understand correctly, you do\n\n2:24:08.260 --> 2:24:13.900\n cold showers, and Joe Rogan was talking about how he needs to do some fairly intensive kind\n\n2:24:13.900 --> 2:24:21.040\n of struggle that is a non comfort to actually induce being better as a person, this concept\n\n2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:27.560\n of hormesis, that it's actually stressing an adaptive system that increases its adaptive\n\n2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:33.020\n capacity, and that there's something that the happiness of a system has something to\n\n2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:37.000\n do with its adaptive capacity, its overall resilience, health, well being, which requires\n\n2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.020\n a decent bit of discomfort.\n\n2:24:40.020 --> 2:24:46.220\n And yet, in the presence of the comfort solution, it's very hard to not choose it, and then\n\n2:24:46.220 --> 2:24:51.800\n as you're choosing it regularly, to actually down regulate your overall adaptive capacity.\n\n2:24:51.800 --> 2:25:00.460\n And so, when we start saying, can we make tech where we're measuring for the things\n\n2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:06.580\n that it produces beyond just the measure of GDP or whatever particular measures look like\n\n2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:13.660\n the revenue generation or profit generation of my business, are all the meaningful things\n\n2:25:13.660 --> 2:25:20.020\n measurable, and what are the right measures, and what are the externalities of optimizing\n\n2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:23.660\n for that measurement set, what meaningful things aren't included in that measurement\n\n2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.100\n set, that might have their own externalities, these are some of the questions we actually\n\n2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:28.100\n have to take seriously.\n\n2:25:28.100 --> 2:25:31.140\n Yeah, and I think they're answerable questions, right?\n\n2:25:31.140 --> 2:25:33.020\n Progressively better, not perfect.\n\n2:25:33.020 --> 2:25:37.740\n Right, so first of all, let me throw out happiness and comfort out of the discussion, those seem\n\n2:25:37.740 --> 2:25:43.500\n like useless, the distinction, because I said they're useful, well being is useful, but\n\n2:25:43.500 --> 2:25:47.940\n I think I take it back.\n\n2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:59.180\n I propose new metrics in this brainstorm session, which is, so one is like personal growth,\n\n2:25:59.180 --> 2:26:05.700\n which is intellectual growth, I think we're able to make that concrete for ourselves,\n\n2:26:05.700 --> 2:26:11.540\n like you're a better person than you were a week ago, or a worse person than you were\n\n2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:12.540\n a week ago.\n\n2:26:12.540 --> 2:26:18.380\n I think we can ourselves report that, and understand what that means, it's this grey\n\n2:26:18.380 --> 2:26:22.940\n area, and we try to define it, but I think we humans are pretty good at that, because\n\n2:26:22.940 --> 2:26:27.220\n we have a sense, an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become.\n\n2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:31.420\n We all dream of becoming a certain kind of person, and I think we have a sense of getting\n\n2:26:31.420 --> 2:26:34.280\n closer and not towards that person.\n\n2:26:34.280 --> 2:26:36.400\n Maybe this is not a great metric, fine.\n\n2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:39.680\n The other one is love, actually.\n\n2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:45.620\n Like if you're happy or not, or you're comfortable or not, how much love do you have towards\n\n2:26:45.620 --> 2:26:47.100\n your fellow human beings?\n\n2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:51.540\n I feel like if you try to optimize that, and increasing that, that's going to have, that's\n\n2:26:51.540 --> 2:26:55.720\n a good metric.\n\n2:26:55.720 --> 2:27:00.860\n How many times a day, sorry, if I can quantify, how many times a day have you thought positively\n\n2:27:00.860 --> 2:27:02.860\n of another human being?\n\n2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:06.380\n Put that down as a number, and increase that number.\n\n2:27:06.380 --> 2:27:13.660\n I think the process of saying, okay, so let's not take GDP or GDP per capita as the metric\n\n2:27:13.660 --> 2:27:18.020\n we want to optimize for, because GDP goes up during war, and it goes up with more healthcare\n\n2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:21.620\n spending from sicker people, and various things that we wouldn't say correlate to quality\n\n2:27:21.620 --> 2:27:23.260\n of life.\n\n2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:24.260\n Addiction drives GDP awesomely.\n\n2:27:24.260 --> 2:27:28.260\n By the way, when I said growth, I wasn't referring to GDP.\n\n2:27:28.260 --> 2:27:29.260\n I know.\n\n2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:33.980\n I'm giving an example now of the primary metric we use, and why it's not an adequate metric,\n\n2:27:33.980 --> 2:27:35.380\n because we're exploring other ones.\n\n2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:41.700\n So the idea of saying, what would the metrics for a good civilization be?\n\n2:27:41.700 --> 2:27:44.880\n If I had to pick a set of metrics, what would the best ones be if I was going to optimize\n\n2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:46.440\n for those?\n\n2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.980\n And then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply, and say, okay, so what happens\n\n2:27:51.980 --> 2:27:54.440\n if we optimize for that?\n\n2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.820\n Try to think through the first, and second, and third order effects of what happens that's\n\n2:27:58.820 --> 2:28:03.000\n positive, and then also say, what negative things can happen from optimizing that?\n\n2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:07.040\n What actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining it?\n\n2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:11.320\n Because love versus number of positive thoughts per day, I could just make a long list of\n\n2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:13.860\n names and just say positive thing about each one.\n\n2:28:13.860 --> 2:28:15.780\n It's all very superficial.\n\n2:28:15.780 --> 2:28:20.900\n Not include animals or the rest of life, have a very shallow total amount of it, but I'm\n\n2:28:20.900 --> 2:28:24.920\n optimizing the number, and if I get some credit for the number.\n\n2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:29.220\n And this is when I said the model of reality isn't reality.\n\n2:28:29.220 --> 2:28:33.300\n When you make a set of metrics that we're going to optimize for this, whatever reality\n\n2:28:33.300 --> 2:28:38.000\n is that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs, which is why\n\n2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:48.880\n I would say that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices\n\n2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.660\n beyond what metrics based optimization would offer.\n\n2:28:53.660 --> 2:29:03.940\n Yeah, but another way to say that is wisdom is a constantly expanding and evolving set\n\n2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:06.260\n of metrics.\n\n2:29:06.260 --> 2:29:10.060\n Which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new metric that's important\n\n2:29:10.060 --> 2:29:11.520\n that isn't part of that metric set.\n\n2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:19.100\n So there's a certain kind of connection, discernment, awareness, and this is an iterative game theory.\n\n2:29:19.100 --> 2:29:20.820\n There's a girdles and completeness theorem, right?\n\n2:29:20.820 --> 2:29:24.260\n Which is if the system, if the set of things is consistent, it won't be complete.\n\n2:29:24.260 --> 2:29:27.980\n So we're going to keep adding to it, which is why we were saying earlier, I don't think\n\n2:29:27.980 --> 2:29:30.300\n it's not beautiful.\n\n2:29:30.300 --> 2:29:32.740\n And especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at\n\n2:29:32.740 --> 2:29:34.580\n the individual level is becoming, right?\n\n2:29:34.580 --> 2:29:35.580\n That we're becoming more.\n\n2:29:35.580 --> 2:29:39.720\n Well, that then becomes true for the civilization and our metric sets as well.\n\n2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:44.300\n And our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a meaningful civilization.\n\n2:29:44.300 --> 2:29:46.700\n I can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are.\n\n2:29:46.700 --> 2:29:50.980\n What's that?\n\n2:29:50.980 --> 2:29:52.500\n Well love is obviously not a metric.\n\n2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:53.500\n It's like you can bench.\n\n2:29:53.500 --> 2:29:54.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:54.500 --> 2:29:55.500\n It's a good metric.\n\n2:29:55.500 --> 2:29:56.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:56.500 --> 2:30:01.400\n I want to optimize that across the entire population, starting with infants.\n\n2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:06.860\n So in the same way that love isn't a metric, but you could make metrics that look at certain\n\n2:30:06.860 --> 2:30:07.860\n parts of it.\n\n2:30:07.860 --> 2:30:11.500\n The thing I'm about to say isn't a metric, but it's a, it's a consideration because I\n\n2:30:11.500 --> 2:30:12.500\n thought about this a lot.\n\n2:30:12.500 --> 2:30:16.260\n I don't think there is a metric, a right one.\n\n2:30:16.260 --> 2:30:20.220\n I think that every metric by itself without this thing we talked about of the continuous\n\n2:30:20.220 --> 2:30:22.660\n improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer.\n\n2:30:22.660 --> 2:30:28.700\n I think that's why what the idea of false idol means in terms of the model of reality\n\n2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:29.860\n not being reality.\n\n2:30:29.860 --> 2:30:34.100\n Then my sacred relationship is to reality itself, which also binds me to the unknown\n\n2:30:34.100 --> 2:30:35.100\n forever.\n\n2:30:35.100 --> 2:30:36.500\n To the known, but also to the unknown.\n\n2:30:36.500 --> 2:30:41.220\n And there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates an epistemic humility\n\n2:30:41.220 --> 2:30:45.900\n that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing I know, but to learn new stuff.\n\n2:30:45.900 --> 2:30:47.620\n And to be open to perceive reality directly.\n\n2:30:47.620 --> 2:30:49.020\n So my model never becomes sacred.\n\n2:30:49.020 --> 2:30:50.020\n My model is useful.\n\n2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:51.020\n My\n\n2:30:51.020 --> 2:30:53.380\n So the model can't be the false idol.\n\n2:30:53.380 --> 2:30:54.380\n Correct.\n\n2:30:54.380 --> 2:30:55.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:30:55.380 --> 2:30:59.060\n And this is why the first verse of the Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not\n\n2:30:59.060 --> 2:31:00.660\n the eternal Tao.\n\n2:31:00.660 --> 2:31:04.140\n The naming then can become the source of the 10,000 things that if you get too carried\n\n2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:08.540\n away with it can actually obscure you from paying attention to reality beyond in the\n\n2:31:08.540 --> 2:31:09.540\n models.\n\n2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:14.020\n It sounds a lot, a lot like Stephen Wolfram, but in a different language, much more poetic.\n\n2:31:14.020 --> 2:31:15.460\n I can imagine that.\n\n2:31:15.460 --> 2:31:20.700\n No, I'm referring, I'm joking, but there's a echoes of cellular automata, which you can't\n\n2:31:20.700 --> 2:31:21.700\n name.\n\n2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:24.380\n You can't construct a good model cellular automata.\n\n2:31:24.380 --> 2:31:26.380\n You can only watch in awe.\n\n2:31:26.380 --> 2:31:27.780\n I apologize.\n\n2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:32.000\n I'm distracting your train of thought horribly and miserably making it different.\n\n2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:36.900\n By the way, something robots aren't good at and dealing with the uncertainty of uneven\n\n2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:37.900\n ground.\n\n2:31:37.900 --> 2:31:38.900\n You've been okay so far.\n\n2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:40.380\n You've been doing wonderfully.\n\n2:31:40.380 --> 2:31:41.380\n So what's your favorite metrics?\n\n2:31:41.380 --> 2:31:42.380\n Okay.\n\n2:31:42.380 --> 2:31:43.380\n So I know you're not a robot.\n\n2:31:43.380 --> 2:31:44.380\n So I have a\n\n2:31:44.380 --> 2:31:50.380\n So one metric, and there are problems with this, but one metric that I like to just as\n\n2:31:50.380 --> 2:31:56.980\n a thought experiment to consider is because you're actually asking, I mean, I know you\n\n2:31:56.980 --> 2:32:01.340\n ask your guests about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're saying what\n\n2:32:01.340 --> 2:32:06.560\n is a desirable civilization, you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful\n\n2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:11.700\n human life and to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to\n\n2:32:11.700 --> 2:32:17.260\n that, right?\n\n2:32:17.260 --> 2:32:22.260\n And then you have whatever your answer is, how do you know what is the epistemic basis\n\n2:32:22.260 --> 2:32:25.140\n for postulating that?\n\n2:32:25.140 --> 2:32:27.540\n There's also a whole nother reason for asking that question.\n\n2:32:27.540 --> 2:32:34.140\n I don't, I mean, that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever, which is, it's interesting\n\n2:32:34.140 --> 2:32:41.100\n how few people have been asked questions like it.\n\n2:32:41.100 --> 2:32:45.460\n The joke about these questions is silly, right?\n\n2:32:45.460 --> 2:32:50.740\n It's funny to watch a person and if I was more of an asshole, I would really stick on\n\n2:32:50.740 --> 2:32:51.740\n that question.\n\n2:32:51.740 --> 2:32:52.740\n Right.\n\n2:32:52.740 --> 2:32:58.420\n It's a silly question in some sense, but like we haven't really considered what it means.\n\n2:32:58.420 --> 2:33:03.020\n Just a more concrete version of that question is what is a better world?\n\n2:33:03.020 --> 2:33:06.340\n What is the kind of world we're trying to create really?\n\n2:33:06.340 --> 2:33:07.340\n Have you really thought,\n\n2:33:07.340 --> 2:33:13.140\n I'll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me, but let\n\n2:33:13.140 --> 2:33:17.340\n me do the societal indices first because they're fun.\n\n2:33:17.340 --> 2:33:20.700\n We should take a note of this meaningful thing because it's important to come back to.\n\n2:33:20.700 --> 2:33:23.740\n Are you reminding me to ask you about the meaning of life?\n\n2:33:23.740 --> 2:33:24.740\n Noted.\n\n2:33:24.740 --> 2:33:28.540\n Let me jot that down.\n\n2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:33.220\n So because I think I stopped tracking it like 25 open threads.\n\n2:33:33.220 --> 2:33:34.220\n Okay.\n\n2:33:34.220 --> 2:33:36.340\n Let it all burn.\n\n2:33:36.340 --> 2:33:42.100\n One index that I find very interesting is the inverse correlation of addiction within\n\n2:33:42.100 --> 2:33:45.260\n the society.\n\n2:33:45.260 --> 2:33:50.540\n The more a society produces addiction within the people in it, the less healthy I think\n\n2:33:50.540 --> 2:33:54.900\n the society is as a pretty fundamental metric.\n\n2:33:54.900 --> 2:34:01.940\n And so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things in compelling\n\n2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:06.940\n them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values.\n\n2:34:06.940 --> 2:34:12.220\n And insofar as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it,\n\n2:34:12.220 --> 2:34:14.860\n the inverse of addiction.\n\n2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:15.860\n Lovely defined.\n\n2:34:15.860 --> 2:34:16.860\n Correct.\n\n2:34:16.860 --> 2:34:17.860\n Addiction.\n\n2:34:17.860 --> 2:34:18.860\n What's it?\n\n2:34:18.860 --> 2:34:19.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:19.860 --> 2:34:25.020\n Compulsive behavior that is destructive towards things that we value.\n\n2:34:25.020 --> 2:34:28.180\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:29.980\n I think that's a very interesting one to think about.\n\n2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:30.980\n That's a really interesting one.\n\n2:34:30.980 --> 2:34:35.740\n And this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close.\n\n2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:40.420\n And the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed\n\n2:34:40.420 --> 2:34:46.540\n to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and\n\n2:34:46.540 --> 2:34:51.140\n needing that hypernormal stimuli, which does involve a kind of hormesis.\n\n2:34:51.140 --> 2:35:00.900\n So I do think the civilization of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort.\n\n2:35:00.900 --> 2:35:11.060\n And I think that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and\n\n2:35:11.060 --> 2:35:13.420\n the ayahuasca journey and the Sundance were.\n\n2:35:13.420 --> 2:35:20.400\n I think it's even a big part of what yoga asana was, is to make beings that are resilient\n\n2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:23.140\n and strong, they have to overcome some things.\n\n2:35:23.140 --> 2:35:27.620\n To make beings that can control their own mind and fear, they have to face some fears.\n\n2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:31.200\n But we don't want to put everybody in war or real trauma.\n\n2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:35.700\n And yet we can see that the most fucked up people we know had childhoods of a lot of\n\n2:35:35.700 --> 2:35:36.700\n trauma.\n\n2:35:36.700 --> 2:35:40.220\n But some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods of a lot of trauma, whether\n\n2:35:40.220 --> 2:35:43.300\n or not they happened to make it through and overcome that or not.\n\n2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:49.620\n So how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever\n\n2:35:49.620 --> 2:35:52.900\n that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people?\n\n2:35:52.900 --> 2:36:01.680\n A certain kind of ritualized discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves,\n\n2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:05.020\n but overcome it together with each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the\n\n2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:06.020\n other people are there.\n\n2:36:06.020 --> 2:36:11.340\n So it's both a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding.\n\n2:36:11.340 --> 2:36:15.700\n So I think we'll keep getting more and more comfortable stuff, but we have to also develop\n\n2:36:15.700 --> 2:36:21.740\n resilience in the presence of that for the anti addiction direction and the fullness\n\n2:36:21.740 --> 2:36:24.820\n of character and the trustworthiness to others.\n\n2:36:24.820 --> 2:36:30.660\n So you have to be consistently injecting discomfort into the system, ritualize.\n\n2:36:30.660 --> 2:36:34.740\n I mean, this sounds like you have to imagine Sisyphus happy.\n\n2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:45.060\n You have to imagine Sisyphus with his rock, optimally resilient from a metrics perspective\n\n2:36:45.060 --> 2:36:47.140\n in society.\n\n2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:52.580\n So we want to constantly be throwing rocks at ourselves.\n\n2:36:52.580 --> 2:36:54.420\n Not constantly.\n\n2:36:54.420 --> 2:37:00.980\n You didn't have to frequently, periodically, and there's different levels of intensity,\n\n2:37:00.980 --> 2:37:01.980\n different periodicities.\n\n2:37:01.980 --> 2:37:05.380\n Now, I do not think this should be imposed by states.\n\n2:37:05.380 --> 2:37:09.040\n I think it should emerge from cultures.\n\n2:37:09.040 --> 2:37:12.540\n And I think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of it.\n\n2:37:12.540 --> 2:37:19.220\n So there is both a cultural cohesion to it, but there's also a voluntaryism because the\n\n2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:22.420\n people value the thing that is being developed and understand it.\n\n2:37:22.420 --> 2:37:28.480\n And that's what conditioning, it's conditioning some of these values.\n\n2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:32.440\n Conditioning is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty, but when we recognize\n\n2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:38.180\n the language that we speak and the words that we think in and the patterns of thought built\n\n2:37:38.180 --> 2:37:42.440\n into that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just\n\n2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:45.420\n based on where we're born, you can't not condition people.\n\n2:37:45.420 --> 2:37:48.900\n So all you can do is take more responsibility for what the conditioning factors are.\n\n2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:51.860\n And then you have to think about this question of what is a meaningful human life?\n\n2:37:51.860 --> 2:37:55.940\n Because we're, unlike the other animals born into environment that they're genetically\n\n2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:59.980\n adapted for, we're building new environments that we were not adapted for, and then we're\n\n2:37:59.980 --> 2:38:02.140\n becoming affected by those.\n\n2:38:02.140 --> 2:38:06.340\n So then we have to say, well, what kinds of environments, digital environments, physical\n\n2:38:06.340 --> 2:38:13.100\n environments, social environments would we want to create that would develop the healthiest,\n\n2:38:13.100 --> 2:38:16.640\n happiest, most moral, noble, meaningful people?\n\n2:38:16.640 --> 2:38:18.280\n What are even those sets of things that matter?\n\n2:38:18.280 --> 2:38:23.460\n So you end up getting deep existential consideration at the heart of civilization design when you\n\n2:38:23.460 --> 2:38:27.420\n start to realize how powerful we're becoming and how much what we're building it in service\n\n2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:28.420\n towards matters.\n\n2:38:28.420 --> 2:38:34.960\n Before I pull it, I think three threads you just laid down, is there another metric index\n\n2:38:34.960 --> 2:38:35.960\n that you're interested in?\n\n2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:39.780\n There's one more that I really like.\n\n2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:51.720\n There's a number, but the next one that comes to mind is I have to make a very quick model.\n\n2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:58.280\n Healthy human bonding, say we were in a tribal type setting, my positive emotional states\n\n2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:03.460\n and your positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated, your negative emotional\n\n2:39:03.460 --> 2:39:04.860\n states and mine.\n\n2:39:04.860 --> 2:39:10.200\n And so you start laughing, I start laughing, you start crying, my eyes might tear up.\n\n2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:15.080\n And we would call that the compassion compersion axis.\n\n2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:18.860\n I would, this is a model I find useful.\n\n2:39:18.860 --> 2:39:23.000\n So compassion is when you're feeling something negative, I feel some pain, I feel some empathy,\n\n2:39:23.000 --> 2:39:24.880\n something in relationship.\n\n2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:27.600\n Compersion is when you do well, I'm stoked for you, right?\n\n2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:29.640\n Like I actually feel happiness at your happiness.\n\n2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:30.640\n I like compersion.\n\n2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.800\n Yeah, the fact that it's such an uncommon word in English is actually a problem culturally.\n\n2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:40.320\n Because I feel that often, and I think that's a really good feeling to feel and maximize\n\n2:39:40.320 --> 2:39:41.320\n for actually.\n\n2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:46.280\n That's actually the metric I'm going to say is the compassion compersion axis is the thing\n\n2:39:46.280 --> 2:39:47.640\n I would optimize for.\n\n2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:53.080\n Now, there is a state where my emotional states and your emotional states are just totally\n\n2:39:53.080 --> 2:39:55.080\n decoupled.\n\n2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.200\n And that is like sociopathy.\n\n2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:01.520\n I don't want to hurt you, but I don't care if I do or for you to do well or whatever.\n\n2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:06.240\n But there's a worse state and it's extremely common, which is where they're inversely coupled.\n\n2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:11.280\n Where my positive emotions correspond to your negative ones and vice versa.\n\n2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:17.200\n And that is the, I would call it the jealousy sadism axis.\n\n2:40:17.200 --> 2:40:20.640\n The jealousy axis is when you're doing really well, I feel something bad.\n\n2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:26.320\n I feel taken away from, less than, upset, envious, whatever.\n\n2:40:26.320 --> 2:40:34.560\n And that's so common, but I think of it as kind of a low grade psychopathology that we've\n\n2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:36.740\n just normalized.\n\n2:40:36.740 --> 2:40:41.080\n The idea that I'm actually upset at the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like\n\n2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:42.920\n a profoundly fucked up thing.\n\n2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:45.480\n No, we shouldn't shame it and repress it so it gets worse.\n\n2:40:45.480 --> 2:40:46.560\n We should study it.\n\n2:40:46.560 --> 2:40:47.560\n Where does it come from?\n\n2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:50.760\n And it comes from our own insecurities and stuff.\n\n2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:55.160\n But then the next part that everybody knows is really fucked up is just on the same axis.\n\n2:40:55.160 --> 2:41:01.120\n It's the same inverted, which is to the jealousy or the envy is the, I feel badly when you're\n\n2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:02.160\n doing well.\n\n2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:06.880\n The sadism side is I actually feel good when you lose or when you're in pain, I feel some\n\n2:41:06.880 --> 2:41:07.880\n happiness that's associated.\n\n2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:12.280\n And you can see when someone feels jealous, sometimes they feel jealous with a partner\n\n2:41:12.280 --> 2:41:17.540\n and then they feel they want that partner to get it, revenge comes up or something.\n\n2:41:17.540 --> 2:41:23.160\n So sadism is really like jealousy is one step on the path to sadism from the healthy compassion\n\n2:41:23.160 --> 2:41:24.160\n conversion axis.\n\n2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:30.280\n So, I would like to see a society that is inversely, that is conditioning sadism and\n\n2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:32.840\n jealousy inversely, right?\n\n2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:36.040\n The lower that amount and the more the compassion conversion.\n\n2:41:36.040 --> 2:41:42.240\n And if I had to summarize that very simply, I'd say it would optimize for conversion.\n\n2:41:42.240 --> 2:41:47.840\n Which is because notice that's not just saying love for you where I might be self sacrificing\n\n2:41:47.840 --> 2:41:52.200\n and miserable and I love people, but I kill myself, which I don't think anybody thinks\n\n2:41:52.200 --> 2:41:53.200\n a great idea.\n\n2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:56.400\n Happiness where I might be sociopathically happy where I'm causing problems all over\n\n2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:00.680\n the place or even sadistically happy, but it's a coupling, right?\n\n2:42:00.680 --> 2:42:04.840\n That I'm actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship where\n\n2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:09.820\n I, my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too.\n\n2:42:09.820 --> 2:42:13.920\n That's actually speaking of another pickup line.\n\n2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:19.120\n That's quite honestly what I, as a guy who is single, this is going to come out very\n\n2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:22.840\n ridiculous because it's like, oh yeah, where's your girlfriend, bro?\n\n2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:32.040\n But that's what I look for in a relationship because it's like, it's so much, it's so,\n\n2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:38.000\n it's such an amazing life where you actually get joy from another person's success and\n\n2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:40.120\n they get joy from your success.\n\n2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:45.160\n And then it becomes like you don't actually need to succeed much for that to have a, like\n\n2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:52.380\n a loop, like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially.\n\n2:42:52.380 --> 2:42:53.380\n It's weird.\n\n2:42:53.380 --> 2:42:58.160\n So like just be, just enjoying the happiness of others, the success of others.\n\n2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:02.600\n So this, this is like the, let's call this, cause the first person that drilled this into\n\n2:43:02.600 --> 2:43:05.000\n my head is Rogan, Joe Rogan.\n\n2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:12.880\n He was the embodiment of that cause I saw somebody who is a successful, rich and nonstop\n\n2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:13.880\n true.\n\n2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:19.400\n I mean, you could tell when somebody is full of shit and somebody is not really genuinely\n\n2:43:19.400 --> 2:43:22.320\n enjoying the success of his friends.\n\n2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:23.320\n That was weird to me.\n\n2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:24.320\n That was interesting.\n\n2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:30.240\n And I mean, the way you're kind of speaking to it, the reason Joe stood out to me is I\n\n2:43:30.240 --> 2:43:36.840\n guess I haven't witnessed genuine expression of that often in this culture of just real\n\n2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:38.000\n joy for others.\n\n2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:43.680\n I mean, part of that has to do, there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or\n\n2:43:43.680 --> 2:43:46.040\n listen to people being their authentic selves.\n\n2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:49.600\n So I'm sure there's a bunch of people who live life with compersion.\n\n2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:56.360\n They probably don't seek public attention also, but that was, yeah, if there was any\n\n2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:00.720\n word that could express what I've learned from Joe, why he's been a really inspiring\n\n2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:03.000\n figure is that compersion.\n\n2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:12.840\n And I wish our world was, had a lot more of that cause then it may, I mean, my own, sorry\n\n2:44:12.840 --> 2:44:19.360\n to go in a small tangent, but like you're speaking how society should function.\n\n2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:25.780\n But I feel like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life, you're going to\n\n2:44:25.780 --> 2:44:27.840\n live a truly fulfilling life.\n\n2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:32.260\n I don't know what the right word to use, but that's a really good way to live life.\n\n2:44:32.260 --> 2:44:37.880\n You will also learn what gets in the way of it and how to work with it that if you wanted\n\n2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:42.600\n to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential technologies to do\n\n2:44:42.600 --> 2:44:48.800\n that, you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes.\n\n2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:52.360\n And this is, you know, as you mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you\n\n2:44:52.360 --> 2:44:55.640\n get stoked on other people doing well and then they have a similar relationship to you\n\n2:44:55.640 --> 2:44:59.920\n and everyone is in the process of building each other up.\n\n2:44:59.920 --> 2:45:05.800\n And this is what I would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy version.\n\n2:45:05.800 --> 2:45:12.280\n The healthy version, right, the root, I believe it's a Latin word that means to strive together.\n\n2:45:12.280 --> 2:45:16.360\n And it's that impulse of becoming where I want to become more, but I recognize that\n\n2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:17.820\n there's actually a hormesis.\n\n2:45:17.820 --> 2:45:21.320\n There's a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that.\n\n2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:24.760\n But that means that, yes, there's an impulse where I'm trying to get ahead.\n\n2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:28.760\n Maybe I'm even trying to win, but I actually want a good opponent and I want them to get\n\n2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:32.700\n ahead too because that is where my ongoing becoming happens and the win itself will get\n\n2:45:32.700 --> 2:45:34.520\n boring very quickly.\n\n2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:39.040\n The ongoing becoming is where there's aliveness and for the ongoing becoming, they need to\n\n2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:40.040\n have it too.\n\n2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:41.040\n And that's the strive together.\n\n2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:44.560\n So, in the healthy competition, I'm stoked when they're doing really well because my\n\n2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:47.200\n becoming is supported by it.\n\n2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:55.600\n Now this is actually a very nice segue into a model I like about what a meaningful human\n\n2:45:55.600 --> 2:46:00.120\n life is, if you want to go there.\n\n2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:01.120\n Let's go there.\n\n2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:08.920\n I have three things I'm going elsewhere with, but if we were first, let us take this short\n\n2:46:08.920 --> 2:46:12.120\n stroll through the park of the meaning of life.\n\n2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:16.280\n Daniel, what is a meaningful life?\n\n2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:24.160\n I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning\n\n2:46:24.160 --> 2:46:30.240\n and the word purpose almost interchangeably and they'll think kind of, what is the meaning\n\n2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:31.240\n of my life?\n\n2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:32.240\n What is the meaning of human life?\n\n2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:33.240\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:46:33.240 --> 2:46:35.440\n What's the meaning of the universe?\n\n2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:38.600\n And what is the meaning of existence rather than nonexistence?\n\n2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:43.160\n So, there's a lot of kind of existential considerations there and I think there's some\n\n2:46:43.160 --> 2:46:48.960\n cognitive mistakes that are very easy, like taking the idea of purpose.\n\n2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:49.960\n Which is like a goal?\n\n2:46:49.960 --> 2:46:51.980\n Which is a utilitarian concept.\n\n2:46:51.980 --> 2:46:59.020\n The purpose of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed value.\n\n2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:00.920\n And to say, what is the purpose of everything?\n\n2:47:00.920 --> 2:47:03.480\n Well, purpose is too small of a question.\n\n2:47:03.480 --> 2:47:05.840\n It's fundamentally a relative question within everything.\n\n2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:07.760\n What is the purpose of one thing relative to another?\n\n2:47:07.760 --> 2:47:08.940\n What is the purpose of everything?\n\n2:47:08.940 --> 2:47:11.160\n And there's nothing outside of it with which to say it.\n\n2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:16.160\n We actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose.\n\n2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:19.440\n It doesn't mean it's purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless.\n\n2:47:19.440 --> 2:47:21.500\n It means the concept is too small.\n\n2:47:21.500 --> 2:47:27.240\n Which is why you end up getting to, you know, like in Taoism, talking about the nature of\n\n2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:28.240\n it.\n\n2:47:28.240 --> 2:47:35.320\n Rather, there's a fundamental what where the why can't go deeper is the nature of it.\n\n2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:40.600\n But I'm going to try to speak to a much simpler part, which is when people think about what\n\n2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:42.740\n is a meaningful human life.\n\n2:47:42.740 --> 2:47:48.160\n And kind of if we were to optimize for something at the level of individual life, but also,\n\n2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:54.360\n how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual life lead to the best society\n\n2:47:54.360 --> 2:47:59.880\n for insofar as people living that way affects others and long term, the world as a whole?\n\n2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:05.840\n And how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think about these things?\n\n2:48:05.840 --> 2:48:13.520\n Because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there's value on two sides,\n\n2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:20.520\n individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push harder\n\n2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:22.200\n and whatever.\n\n2:48:22.200 --> 2:48:25.820\n And there's failure modes on both sides.\n\n2:48:25.820 --> 2:48:29.800\n And so, when you were starting to say, okay, individual happiness, you're like, wait, fuck,\n\n2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:31.000\n sadists can be happy while hurting people.\n\n2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:32.680\n It's not individual happiness, it's love.\n\n2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:36.600\n But wait, some people can self sacrifice out of love in a way that actually ends up just\n\n2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:39.200\n creating codependency for everybody.\n\n2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:48.160\n Or okay, so how do we think about all those things together?\n\n2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:54.480\n This kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate to it is that a meaningful\n\n2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:00.160\n life involves the mode of being, the mode of doing and the mode of becoming.\n\n2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:07.720\n And it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes on\n\n2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:12.480\n their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life.\n\n2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:20.280\n The mode of being, the way I would describe it, if we're talking about the essence of\n\n2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:25.440\n it is about taking in and appreciating the beauty of life that is now.\n\n2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:33.040\n It's a mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being with what is.\n\n2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.360\n It's fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of experience.\n\n2:49:37.360 --> 2:49:42.800\n The prima facie meaningfulness of when I'm having this experience, I'm not actually asking\n\n2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:45.400\n what the meaning of life is, I'm actually full of it.\n\n2:49:45.400 --> 2:49:46.880\n I'm full of experiencing it.\n\n2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:49.800\n The momentary experience, the moment.\n\n2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:50.820\n Yes.\n\n2:49:50.820 --> 2:49:54.360\n So taking in the beauty of life.\n\n2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:56.040\n Being is adding to the beauty of life.\n\n2:49:56.040 --> 2:49:59.480\n I'm going to produce some art, I'm going to produce some technology that will make life\n\n2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:01.200\n easier and more beautiful for somebody else.\n\n2:50:01.200 --> 2:50:08.300\n I'm going to do some science that will end up leading to better insights or other people's\n\n2:50:08.300 --> 2:50:11.680\n ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand more about it or whatever\n\n2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:13.240\n it is or protect it, right?\n\n2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:14.680\n I'm going to protect it in some way.\n\n2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:19.780\n But that's adding to or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing.\n\n2:50:19.780 --> 2:50:23.000\n And becoming is getting better at both of those.\n\n2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:26.880\n Being able to deepen our being, which is to be able to take in the beauty of life more\n\n2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:32.680\n profoundly, be more moved by it, touched by it, and increasing our capacity with doing\n\n2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:37.720\n to add to the beauty of life more.\n\n2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:42.560\n So I hold that a meaningful life has to be all three of those.\n\n2:50:42.560 --> 2:50:48.640\n And where they're not in conflict with each other, ultimately it grounds in being, it\n\n2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:52.120\n grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness of experience.\n\n2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:57.440\n And then my doing is ultimately something that will be able to increase the possibility\n\n2:50:57.440 --> 2:51:00.360\n of the quality of experience for others.\n\n2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:03.200\n And my becoming is a deepening on those.\n\n2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:09.000\n So it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary possibility of experience.\n\n2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:18.080\n And the point is to oscillate between these, never getting stuck on any one or I suppose\n\n2:51:18.080 --> 2:51:26.840\n in parallel, well you can't really, attention is a thing, you can only allocate attention.\n\n2:51:26.840 --> 2:51:31.880\n I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I'm not thinking about what to\n\n2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:32.880\n do next.\n\n2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:33.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:39.400\n And then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn't come from what's\n\n2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:45.400\n in it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already.\n\n2:51:45.400 --> 2:51:51.120\n And then it's like how can I make life better for other people that don't have as much opportunities\n\n2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:52.120\n I had?\n\n2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:53.560\n How can I add something wonderful?\n\n2:51:53.560 --> 2:51:56.960\n How can I just be in the creative process?\n\n2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.920\n And so I think where the doing comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness\n\n2:52:01.920 --> 2:52:08.360\n of being, it's inherently going to be paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented\n\n2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:12.200\n to do that than if it comes from some emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that\n\n2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:15.960\n is willing to cause sacrifices other places and where a chunk of its attention is internally\n\n2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:18.620\n focused.\n\n2:52:18.620 --> 2:52:23.720\n And so when Buddha said desire is the cause of all suffering, then later the vow of the\n\n2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:29.340\n Bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient beings in universe forever is a pretty intense\n\n2:52:29.340 --> 2:52:32.920\n thing like desire.\n\n2:52:32.920 --> 2:52:36.160\n I would say there is a kind of desire, if we think of desire as a basis for movement\n\n2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:39.800\n like a flow or a gradient, there's a kind of desire that comes from something missing\n\n2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:43.160\n inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world.\n\n2:52:43.160 --> 2:52:46.880\n That ends up being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering.\n\n2:52:46.880 --> 2:52:51.960\n But there's also not just non desire, there's a kind of desire that comes from feeling full\n\n2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:57.920\n at the beauty of life and wanting to add to it that is a flow this direction.\n\n2:52:57.920 --> 2:52:59.840\n And I don't think that is the cause of suffering.\n\n2:52:59.840 --> 2:53:04.080\n I think that is, you know, and the Western traditions, right, the Eastern traditions\n\n2:53:04.080 --> 2:53:08.680\n focused on that and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them, in the moment outside\n\n2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:09.680\n of time.\n\n2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:12.600\n The Western tradition said, no, actually, desire is the source of creativity and we're\n\n2:53:12.600 --> 2:53:15.660\n here to be made in the image and likeness of the creator.\n\n2:53:15.660 --> 2:53:17.760\n We're here to be fundamentally creative.\n\n2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:21.440\n But creating from where and in service of what?\n\n2:53:21.440 --> 2:53:24.620\n Creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness in service of the well being\n\n2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:28.940\n of all of it is very different.\n\n2:53:28.940 --> 2:53:31.440\n Which is back to that compassion, compersion axis.\n\n2:53:31.440 --> 2:53:34.560\n Being, doing, becoming.\n\n2:53:34.560 --> 2:53:38.000\n It's pretty powerful.\n\n2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:50.960\n You could potentially be algorithmatized into a robot just saying, where does death come\n\n2:53:50.960 --> 2:53:54.680\n into that?\n\n2:53:54.680 --> 2:53:59.400\n Being is forgetting, I mean, the concept of time completely.\n\n2:53:59.400 --> 2:54:07.120\n There's a sense to doing and becoming that has a deadline built in, the urgency built\n\n2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:08.120\n in.\n\n2:54:08.120 --> 2:54:16.560\n Do you think death is fundamental to this, to a meaningful life?\n\n2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:25.360\n Acknowledging or feeling the terror of death, like Ernest Becker, or just acknowledging\n\n2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:31.000\n the uncertainty, the mystery, the melancholy nature of the fact that the ride ends.\n\n2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.560\n Is that part of this equation or it's not necessary?\n\n2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:37.480\n Okay, look at how it could be related.\n\n2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:40.400\n I've experienced fear of death.\n\n2:54:40.400 --> 2:54:47.960\n I've also experienced times where I thought I was going to die that felt extremely peaceful\n\n2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:50.040\n and beautiful.\n\n2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:59.800\n And it's funny because we can be afraid of death because we're afraid of hell or bad\n\n2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:03.600\n reincarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have or we're projecting\n\n2:55:03.600 --> 2:55:05.040\n some kind of sentient suffering.\n\n2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:12.720\n But if we're afraid of just non experience, I noticed that every time I stay up late enough\n\n2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:18.120\n that I'm really tired, I'm longing for deep sleep and non experience, right?\n\n2:55:18.120 --> 2:55:21.640\n Like I'm actually longing for experience to stop.\n\n2:55:21.640 --> 2:55:26.120\n And it's not morbid, it's not a bummer.\n\n2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:30.820\n And I don't mind falling asleep and sometimes when I wake up, I want to go back into it\n\n2:55:30.820 --> 2:55:34.080\n and then when it's done, I'm happy to come out of it.\n\n2:55:34.080 --> 2:55:44.840\n So when we think about death and having finite time here, and we could talk about if we live\n\n2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:47.680\n for a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that, it would still be\n\n2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:49.800\n finite time.\n\n2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:53.520\n The one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start\n\n2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:58.480\n to emotionally mature just shortly before they die.\n\n2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:15.360\n But if I get to live forever, I can just stay focused on what's in it for me forever.\n\n2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:20.440\n And if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and\n\n2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:25.640\n adding to it and becoming continues, my life doesn't, but my life can have effects that\n\n2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:31.300\n continue well beyond it, then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than\n\n2:56:31.300 --> 2:56:32.300\n my life.\n\n2:56:32.300 --> 2:56:35.800\n My life gets to be a part of and in service to.\n\n2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:40.540\n And the whole thing about when old men plant trees, the shade of which they'll never get\n\n2:56:40.540 --> 2:56:41.540\n to be in.\n\n2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:49.640\n I remember the first time I read this poem by Hafez, the Sufi poet, written in like 13th\n\n2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:56.000\n century or something like that, and he talked about that if you're lonely, to think about\n\n2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:01.780\n him and he was kind of leaning his spirit into yours across the distance of a millennium\n\n2:57:01.780 --> 2:57:06.800\n and would comfort you with these poems and just thinking about people a millennium from\n\n2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:10.360\n now and caring about their experience and what they'd be suffering if they'd be lonely\n\n2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:13.120\n and could he offer something that could touch them.\n\n2:57:13.120 --> 2:57:15.340\n And it's just fucking beautiful.\n\n2:57:15.340 --> 2:57:20.460\n And so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with something that transcends\n\n2:57:20.460 --> 2:57:23.060\n what's in it for me.\n\n2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:25.360\n And death forces you to that.\n\n2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:34.040\n So not only does death create the urgency of doing, you're very right, it does have\n\n2:57:34.040 --> 2:57:42.380\n a sense in which it incentivizes the compersion and the compassion.\n\n2:57:42.380 --> 2:57:46.200\n And the widening, you remember Einstein had that quote, something to the effect of it's\n\n2:57:46.200 --> 2:57:50.280\n an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate things.\n\n2:57:50.280 --> 2:57:56.520\n There's this one thing we call universe and something about us being inside of a prison\n\n2:57:56.520 --> 2:58:02.520\n of perception that can only see a very narrow little bit of it.\n\n2:58:02.520 --> 2:58:10.580\n But this might be just some weird disposition of mine, but when I think about the future\n\n2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:18.920\n after I'm dead and I think about consciousness, I think about young people falling in love\n\n2:58:18.920 --> 2:58:22.720\n for the first time and their experience, and I think about people being awed by sunsets\n\n2:58:22.720 --> 2:58:27.520\n and I think about all of it, right?\n\n2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:30.240\n I can't not feel connected to that.\n\n2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:37.500\n Do you feel some sadness to the very high likelihood that you will be forgotten completely\n\n2:58:37.500 --> 2:58:46.640\n by all of human history, you, Daniel, the name, that which cannot be named?\n\n2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:52.520\n Systems like to self perpetuate, egos do that.\n\n2:58:52.520 --> 2:58:56.800\n The idea that I might do something meaningful that future people will appreciate, of course\n\n2:58:56.800 --> 2:59:00.640\n there's like a certain sweetness to that idea.\n\n2:59:00.640 --> 2:59:05.480\n But I know how many people did something, did things that I wouldn't be here without\n\n2:59:05.480 --> 2:59:09.640\n and that my life would be less without, whose names I will never know.\n\n2:59:09.640 --> 2:59:15.460\n And I feel a gratitude to them, I feel a closeness, I feel touched by that, and I think to the\n\n2:59:15.460 --> 2:59:22.100\n degree that the future people are conscious enough, there is a, you know, a lot of traditions\n\n2:59:22.100 --> 2:59:26.720\n have this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond the names.\n\n2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:30.160\n I think that's a very healthy idea.\n\n2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:36.520\n But let me return to a much less beautiful and a much less pleasant conversation.\n\n2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:37.600\n You mentioned prison.\n\n2:59:37.600 --> 2:59:41.040\n Back to X risk, okay.\n\n2:59:41.040 --> 2:59:43.440\n And conditioning.\n\n2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:48.200\n You mentioned something about the state.\n\n2:59:48.200 --> 2:59:56.440\n So what role, let's talk about companies, governments, parents, all the mechanisms that\n\n2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:58.840\n can be a source of conditioning.\n\n2:59:58.840 --> 3:00:01.840\n Which flavor of ice cream do you like?\n\n3:00:01.840 --> 3:00:05.680\n Do you think the state is the right thing for the future?\n\n3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:10.200\n So governments that are elected democratic systems that are representing representative\n\n3:00:10.200 --> 3:00:11.660\n democracy.\n\n3:00:11.660 --> 3:00:17.920\n Is there some kind of political system of governance that you find appealing?\n\n3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:26.000\n Is it parents, meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that's the most essential?\n\n3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:34.000\n And then you and Michael Malice would happily agree that it's anarchy, or the state should\n\n3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:42.680\n be dissolved or destroyed or burned to the ground if you're Michael Malice, giggling,\n\n3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:46.200\n holding the torch as the fire burns.\n\n3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:50.960\n So which which is it is the state can state be good?\n\n3:00:50.960 --> 3:00:57.480\n Or is the state bad for the conditioning of a beautiful world, A or B?\n\n3:00:57.480 --> 3:00:58.920\n This is like an SPT test.\n\n3:00:58.920 --> 3:01:03.400\n You like to give these simplified good or bad things.\n\n3:01:03.400 --> 3:01:08.520\n Would I like the state that we live in currently, the United States federal government to stop\n\n3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:09.520\n existing today?\n\n3:01:09.520 --> 3:01:11.560\n No, I would really not like that.\n\n3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:16.960\n I think that would be not quite bad for the world in a lot of ways.\n\n3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:23.520\n Do I think that it's a optimal social system and maximally just and humane and all those\n\n3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:24.520\n things?\n\n3:01:24.520 --> 3:01:25.520\n And I wanted to continue as is.\n\n3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:26.520\n No, also not that.\n\n3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:32.080\n But I am much more interested in it being able to evolve to a better thing without going\n\n3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:38.360\n through the catastrophe phase that I think it's just non existence would give.\n\n3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:45.720\n So what size of state is good in a sense like do we should we as a human society as this\n\n3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:47.160\n world becomes more globalized?\n\n3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:53.680\n Should we be constantly striving to reduce the we can we can put on a map like right\n\n3:01:53.680 --> 3:02:02.000\n now, literally, like the the centers of power in the world, some of them are tech companies,\n\n3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:06.840\n some of them are governments, should we be trying to as much as possible to decentralize\n\n3:02:06.840 --> 3:02:12.640\n the power to where it's very difficult to point on the map, the centers of power.\n\n3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:18.400\n And that means making the state however, there's a bunch of different ways to make the government\n\n3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:28.280\n much smaller, that could be reducing in the United States, reducing the funding for the\n\n3:02:28.280 --> 3:02:33.540\n government, all those kinds of things, their set of responsibilities, the set of powers,\n\n3:02:33.540 --> 3:02:40.720\n it could be, I mean, this is far out, but making more nations, or maybe nations not\n\n3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:45.800\n in the space that are defined by geographic location, but rather in the space of ideas,\n\n3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:47.200\n which is what anarchy is about.\n\n3:02:47.200 --> 3:02:52.760\n So anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set of ideas, and doing so dynamically\n\n3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:56.080\n not based on where you were born, and so on.\n\n3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:03.200\n I think we can say that the natural state of humans, if we want to describe such a thing,\n\n3:03:03.200 --> 3:03:11.240\n is to live in tribes that were below the Dunbar number, meaning that for a few hundred thousand\n\n3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:16.960\n years of human history, all of the groups of humans mostly stayed under that size.\n\n3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:19.720\n And whenever it would get up to that size, it would end up cleaving.\n\n3:03:19.720 --> 3:03:23.880\n And so it seems like there's a pretty strong, but there weren't individual humans out in\n\n3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:25.240\n the wild doing really well, right?\n\n3:03:25.240 --> 3:03:28.720\n So we were a group animal, but with groups that had a specific size.\n\n3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:32.600\n So we could say, in a way, humans were being domesticated by those groups.\n\n3:03:32.600 --> 3:03:36.000\n They were learning how to have certain rules to participate with the group, without which\n\n3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:37.000\n you'd get kicked out.\n\n3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:40.600\n But that's still the wild state of people.\n\n3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:45.240\n And maybe it's useful to do as a side statement, which I've recently looked at a bunch of\n\n3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:49.080\n papers around Dunbar's number, where the mean is actually 150.\n\n3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:51.640\n If you actually look at the original papers, it's a range.\n\n3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:53.240\n It's really a range.\n\n3:03:53.240 --> 3:03:56.120\n So it's actually somewhere under a thousand.\n\n3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:59.120\n So it's a range of like two to 500 or whatever it is.\n\n3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:05.280\n But like you could argue that the, I think it actually is exactly two, the range is two\n\n3:04:05.280 --> 3:04:08.440\n to 520, something like that.\n\n3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:12.080\n And this is the mean that's taken crudely.\n\n3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:18.840\n It's not a very good paper in terms of the actual numerically speaking.\n\n3:04:18.840 --> 3:04:24.680\n But it'd be interesting if there's a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for\n\n3:04:24.680 --> 3:04:26.880\n particular environments, particular conditions, so on.\n\n3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:32.320\n It is very true that they're likely to be something small, you know, under a million.\n\n3:04:32.320 --> 3:04:36.760\n But it'd be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will change\n\n3:04:36.760 --> 3:04:37.760\n the fabric of this conversation.\n\n3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:39.640\n I just want to kind of throw that in there.\n\n3:04:39.640 --> 3:04:43.880\n I don't know if the 150 is baked in somehow into the hardware.\n\n3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:47.120\n We can talk about some of the things that it probably has to do with.\n\n3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:50.240\n Up to a certain number of people.\n\n3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:53.960\n And this is going to be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to\n\n3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:54.960\n some degree.\n\n3:04:54.960 --> 3:04:59.680\n We'll talk about that in a minute.\n\n3:04:59.680 --> 3:05:04.360\n Up to a certain number of people, everybody can know everybody else pretty intimately.\n\n3:05:04.360 --> 3:05:12.320\n So let's go ahead and just take 150 as an average number.\n\n3:05:12.320 --> 3:05:18.860\n Everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly,\n\n3:05:18.860 --> 3:05:22.640\n it's your extended family and you're stuck living with them and you know who they are\n\n3:05:22.640 --> 3:05:24.360\n and there's no anonymous people.\n\n3:05:24.360 --> 3:05:27.200\n There's no just them and over there.\n\n3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:32.400\n And that's one part of what leads to a kind of tribal process where it's good for the\n\n3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:35.300\n individual and good for the whole has a coupling.\n\n3:05:35.300 --> 3:05:41.040\n Also below that scale, everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing.\n\n3:05:41.040 --> 3:05:44.560\n There's not groups that are very siloed.\n\n3:05:44.560 --> 3:05:47.960\n And as a result, it's actually very hard to get away with bad behavior.\n\n3:05:47.960 --> 3:05:50.840\n There's a force kind of transparency.\n\n3:05:50.840 --> 3:05:55.720\n And so you don't need kind of like the state in that way.\n\n3:05:55.720 --> 3:05:58.600\n But lying to people doesn't actually get you ahead.\n\n3:05:58.600 --> 3:06:01.600\n Sociopathic behavior doesn't get you ahead because it gets seen.\n\n3:06:01.600 --> 3:06:06.760\n And so there's a conditioning environment where the individual is behaving in a way\n\n3:06:06.760 --> 3:06:11.440\n that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned.\n\n3:06:11.440 --> 3:06:16.920\n When it gets to be a much larger system, it becomes easier to hide certain things from\n\n3:06:16.920 --> 3:06:22.800\n the group as a whole as well as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people.\n\n3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:29.440\n I would say there's also a communication protocol where up to about that number of people, we\n\n3:06:29.440 --> 3:06:33.320\n could all sit around a tribal council and be part of a conversation around a really\n\n3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:34.320\n big decision.\n\n3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:35.320\n Do we migrate?\n\n3:06:35.320 --> 3:06:36.320\n Do we not migrate?\n\n3:06:36.320 --> 3:06:37.320\n Do we, you know, something like that?\n\n3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:39.080\n Do we get rid of this person?\n\n3:06:39.080 --> 3:06:47.160\n And why would I want to agree to be a part of a larger group where everyone can't be\n\n3:06:47.160 --> 3:06:49.160\n part of that council?\n\n3:06:49.160 --> 3:06:54.520\n And so I am going to now be subject to law that I have no say in if I could be part of\n\n3:06:54.520 --> 3:06:58.120\n a smaller group that could still survive and I get a say in the law that I'm subject to.\n\n3:06:58.120 --> 3:07:03.040\n So I think the cleaving and a way we can look at it beyond the Dunbar number two is we can\n\n3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:08.140\n look at that a civilization has binding energy that is holding them together and has cleaving\n\n3:07:08.140 --> 3:07:09.140\n energy.\n\n3:07:09.140 --> 3:07:12.960\n And if the binding energy exceeds the cleaving energy, that civilization will last.\n\n3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:16.560\n And so there are things that we can do to decrease the cleaving energy within the society,\n\n3:07:16.560 --> 3:07:18.200\n things we can do to increase the binding energy.\n\n3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:22.060\n I think naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size kind\n\n3:07:22.060 --> 3:07:24.440\n of tribalism.\n\n3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:25.800\n That ended with a few things.\n\n3:07:25.800 --> 3:07:31.460\n It ended with people having migrated enough that when you started to get resource wars,\n\n3:07:31.460 --> 3:07:33.360\n you couldn't just migrate away easily.\n\n3:07:33.360 --> 3:07:35.120\n And so tribal warfare became more obligated.\n\n3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:39.600\n It involved the plow and the beginning of real economic surplus.\n\n3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:45.640\n So there were a few different kind of forcing functions.\n\n3:07:45.640 --> 3:07:48.440\n But we're talking about what size should it be, right?\n\n3:07:48.440 --> 3:07:50.000\n What size should a society be?\n\n3:07:50.000 --> 3:07:55.720\n And I think the idea, like if we think about your body for a moment as a self organizing\n\n3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:58.800\n complex system that is multi scaled, we think about...\n\n3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:00.400\n Our body is a wonderland.\n\n3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:04.720\n Our body is a wonderland, yeah.\n\n3:08:04.720 --> 3:08:06.560\n That's a John Mayer song.\n\n3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:07.560\n I apologize.\n\n3:08:07.560 --> 3:08:12.040\n But yes, so if we think about our body and the billions of cells that are in it.\n\n3:08:12.040 --> 3:08:14.040\n Well, you don't have...\n\n3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:18.320\n Think about how ridiculous it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells\n\n3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:21.880\n in it with no internal organization structure, right?\n\n3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:24.200\n Just like a sea of protoplasm.\n\n3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:25.200\n It wouldn't work.\n\n3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:26.200\n Pure democracy.\n\n3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:31.800\n And so you have cells and tissues, and then you have tissues and organs and organs and\n\n3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:36.280\n organ systems, and so you have these layers of organization, and then obviously the individual\n\n3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:39.720\n in a tribe in a ecosystem.\n\n3:08:39.720 --> 3:08:44.400\n And each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers, but also influencing\n\n3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:45.400\n them.\n\n3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:49.800\n I think the future of civilization will be similar, which is there's a level of governance\n\n3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:51.480\n that happens at the level of the individual.\n\n3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:54.600\n My own governance of my own choice.\n\n3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:57.800\n I think there's a level that happens at the level of a family.\n\n3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:01.000\n We're making decisions together, we're inter influencing each other and affecting each\n\n3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:05.120\n other, taking responsibility for the idea of an extended family.\n\n3:09:05.120 --> 3:09:08.160\n And you can see that like for a lot of human history, we had an extended family, we had\n\n3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:13.520\n a local community, a local church or whatever it was, we had these intermediate structures.\n\n3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:20.000\n Whereas right now, there's kind of like the individual producer, consumer, taxpayer, voter,\n\n3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:24.280\n and the massive nation state global complex, and not that much in the way of intermediate\n\n3:09:24.280 --> 3:09:28.040\n structures that we relate with, and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics,\n\n3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:31.520\n all impersonalized, made fungible.\n\n3:09:31.520 --> 3:09:39.040\n And so, I think that we have to have global governance, meaning I think we have to have\n\n3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:43.280\n governance at the scale we affect stuff, and if anybody is messing up the oceans, that\n\n3:09:43.280 --> 3:09:44.280\n matters for everybody.\n\n3:09:44.280 --> 3:09:48.240\n So, that can't only be national or only local.\n\n3:09:48.240 --> 3:09:51.820\n Everyone is scared of the idea of global governance because we think about some top down system\n\n3:09:51.820 --> 3:09:54.960\n of imposition that now has no checks and balances on power.\n\n3:09:54.960 --> 3:10:00.080\n I'm scared of that same version, so I'm not talking about that kind of global governance.\n\n3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:03.680\n It's why I'm even using the word governance as a process rather than government as an\n\n3:10:03.680 --> 3:10:07.600\n imposed phenomena.\n\n3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:11.560\n And so, I think we have to have global governance, but I think we also have to have local governance,\n\n3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:16.280\n and there has to be relationships between them that each, where there are both checks\n\n3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:18.760\n and balances and power flows of information.\n\n3:10:18.760 --> 3:10:24.840\n So, I think governance at the level of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than governance\n\n3:10:24.840 --> 3:10:30.320\n at the level of nation states because I think nation states are largely fictitious things\n\n3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:34.280\n that are defined by wars and agreements to stop wars and like that.\n\n3:10:34.280 --> 3:10:38.400\n I think cities are based on real things that will keep being real where the proximity of\n\n3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:43.280\n certain things together, the physical proximity of things together gives increased value of\n\n3:10:43.280 --> 3:10:44.280\n those things.\n\n3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:50.360\n So, you look at like Jeffrey West's work on scale and finding that companies and nation\n\n3:10:50.360 --> 3:10:54.440\n states and things that have a kind of complicated agreement structure get diminishing return\n\n3:10:54.440 --> 3:10:58.920\n of, of production per capita as the total number of people increases beyond about the\n\n3:10:58.920 --> 3:10:59.920\n tribal scale.\n\n3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:04.280\n But the city actually gets increasing productivity per capita, but it's not designed, it's kind\n\n3:11:04.280 --> 3:11:06.160\n of this organic thing, right?\n\n3:11:06.160 --> 3:11:10.320\n So, there should be governance at the level of cities because people can sense and actually\n\n3:11:10.320 --> 3:11:15.040\n have some agency there, probably neighborhoods and smaller scales within it and also verticals\n\n3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:17.840\n and some of it won't be geographic, it'll be network based, right?\n\n3:11:17.840 --> 3:11:18.840\n Networks of affinities.\n\n3:11:18.840 --> 3:11:21.760\n So, I don't think the future is one type of governance.\n\n3:11:21.760 --> 3:11:26.520\n Now, what we can say more broadly is say, when we're talking about groups of people\n\n3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:30.380\n that inner affect each other, the idea of a civilization is that we can figure out how\n\n3:11:30.380 --> 3:11:35.520\n to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with each other and hopefully increase\n\n3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:40.440\n total productive capacity in a way that's good for everybody, division of labor and\n\n3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:44.880\n specialty so we all get more better stuff and whatever.\n\n3:11:44.880 --> 3:11:49.800\n But it's a, it's a coordination of our choice making.\n\n3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:55.240\n I think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not having enough coordination\n\n3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:58.720\n of choice making, so they fail on the side of chaos and then they cleave and an internal\n\n3:11:58.720 --> 3:12:04.720\n war comes about or whatever, or they can't make smart decisions and they overuse their\n\n3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:07.060\n resources or whatever.\n\n3:12:07.060 --> 3:12:14.400\n Or it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition, via force, and so it\n\n3:12:14.400 --> 3:12:20.480\n fails on the side of oppression, which ends up being for a while functionalish for the\n\n3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:25.140\n thing as a whole, but miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of revolt\n\n3:12:25.140 --> 3:12:28.260\n or because it can't innovate enough or something like that.\n\n3:12:28.260 --> 3:12:34.340\n And so, there's this like toggling between order via oppression and chaos.\n\n3:12:34.340 --> 3:12:39.560\n And I think the idea of democracy, not the way we've implemented it, but the idea of\n\n3:12:39.560 --> 3:12:43.840\n it, whether we're talking about a representative democracy or a direct digital democracy, liquid\n\n3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:50.280\n democracy, a republic or whatever, the idea of an open society, participatory governance\n\n3:12:50.280 --> 3:12:56.380\n is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren't stuck with\n\n3:12:56.380 --> 3:13:04.040\n chaos and infighting and inability to coordinate, and we're also not stuck with oppression?\n\n3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:08.620\n And what would it take to have emergent order?\n\n3:13:08.620 --> 3:13:16.520\n This is the most kind of central question for me these days because if we look at what\n\n3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:20.660\n different nation states are doing around the world and we see nation states that are more\n\n3:13:20.660 --> 3:13:26.500\n authoritarian that in some ways are actually coordinating much more effectively.\n\n3:13:26.500 --> 3:13:32.700\n So for instance, we can see that China has built high speed rail not just through its\n\n3:13:32.700 --> 3:13:36.820\n country but around the world and the US hasn't built any high speed rail yet.\n\n3:13:36.820 --> 3:13:41.400\n You can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we've had increasing\n\n3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:43.920\n economic inequality happening.\n\n3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:49.260\n You can see like that if there was a single country that could make all of its own stuff\n\n3:13:49.260 --> 3:13:53.420\n if the global supply chains failed, China would be the closest one to being able to\n\n3:13:53.420 --> 3:13:57.700\n start to go closed loop on fundamental things.\n\n3:13:57.700 --> 3:14:03.840\n Belt and Road Initiative, supply chain on rare earth metals, transistor manufacturing\n\n3:14:03.840 --> 3:14:08.840\n that is like, oh, they're actually coordinating more effectively in some important ways.\n\n3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:12.020\n In the last call it 30 years.\n\n3:14:12.020 --> 3:14:14.680\n And that's imposed order.\n\n3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:16.160\n Imposed order.\n\n3:14:16.160 --> 3:14:24.680\n And we can see that if in the US, let's look at why real quick.\n\n3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:29.040\n We know why we created term limits so that we wouldn't have forever monarchs.\n\n3:14:29.040 --> 3:14:32.320\n That's the thing we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances\n\n3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:34.480\n on power and that kind of thing.\n\n3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:38.560\n But that also has created a negative second order effect, which is nobody does long term\n\n3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:43.200\n planning because somebody comes in who's got four years, they want reelected.\n\n3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:46.440\n They don't do anything that doesn't create a return within four years that will end up\n\n3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:48.880\n getting them elected, reelected.\n\n3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:53.780\n And so the 30 year industrial development to build high speed trains or the new kind\n\n3:14:53.780 --> 3:14:57.040\n of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn't get invested in.\n\n3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:02.840\n And then if you have left versus right, where whatever someone does for four years, then\n\n3:15:02.840 --> 3:15:05.880\n the other guy gets in and undoes it for four years.\n\n3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:08.520\n And most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other.\n\n3:15:08.520 --> 3:15:11.220\n This system is just dissipating as heat, right?\n\n3:15:11.220 --> 3:15:12.800\n Like it's just burning up as heat.\n\n3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:16.540\n And the system that has no term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they\n\n3:15:16.540 --> 3:15:20.040\n got rid of those people can actually coordinate better.\n\n3:15:20.040 --> 3:15:27.400\n But I would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic properties that are\n\n3:15:27.400 --> 3:15:28.400\n not the thing we want.\n\n3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:34.080\n So the goal is to accomplish, to create a system that does long term planning without\n\n3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:45.360\n the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there for the long term and accomplish\n\n3:15:45.360 --> 3:15:54.200\n that through not doing the imposition of a single leader, but through emergence.\n\n3:15:54.200 --> 3:16:03.040\n So that perhaps, first of all, the technology in itself seems to maybe disagree a lot for\n\n3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:08.420\n different possibilities here, which is make primary the system, not the humans.\n\n3:16:08.420 --> 3:16:21.760\n So the basic, the medium on which the democracy happens, like a platform where people can\n\n3:16:21.760 --> 3:16:29.800\n make decisions, do the choice making, the coordination of the choice making, where emerges\n\n3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:34.080\n some kind of order to where like something that applies at the scale of the family, the\n\n3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:43.400\n family, the city, the country, the continent, the whole world, and then does that so dynamically,\n\n3:16:43.400 --> 3:16:48.440\n constantly changing based on the needs of the people, sort of always evolving.\n\n3:16:48.440 --> 3:16:54.960\n And it would all be owned by Google.\n\n3:16:54.960 --> 3:17:00.720\n Is there a way to, so first of all, you're optimistic that you could basically create\n\n3:17:00.720 --> 3:17:06.560\n the technology can save us technology at creating platforms by technology, I mean, like software\n\n3:17:06.560 --> 3:17:14.680\n network platforms that allows humans to deliberate, like make government together dynamically\n\n3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:19.440\n without the need for a leader that's on a podium screaming stuff.\n\n3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:21.240\n That's one and two.\n\n3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:27.680\n If you're optimistic about that, are you also optimistic about the CEOs of such platforms?\n\n3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:36.080\n The idea that technology is values neutral, values agnostic, and people can use it for\n\n3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:40.240\n constructive or destructive purposes, but it doesn't predispose anything.\n\n3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:44.080\n It's just silly and naive.\n\n3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:49.260\n Technology elicits patterns of human behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead\n\n3:17:49.260 --> 3:17:53.680\n end up behaving differently because of their utilization of it, and then other people,\n\n3:17:53.680 --> 3:17:57.620\n then they end up shaping the world or other people race to also get the power of the technology\n\n3:17:57.620 --> 3:18:02.720\n and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the effect on social systems\n\n3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:06.040\n and the minds of people of the change in our tooling.\n\n3:18:06.040 --> 3:18:09.920\n Marvin Harris's work called cultural materialism looked at this deeply, obviously Marshall\n\n3:18:09.920 --> 3:18:13.400\n McLuhan looked specifically at the way that information technologies change the nature\n\n3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:19.120\n of our beliefs, minds, values, social systems.\n\n3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:23.800\n I will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics will disagree on the subtle\n\n3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:27.840\n details but I'll do it kind of like illustratively.\n\n3:18:27.840 --> 3:18:31.560\n You think about the emergence of the plow, the ox drawn plow in the beginning of agriculture\n\n3:18:31.560 --> 3:18:36.160\n that came with it where before that you had hunter gatherer and then you had horticulture\n\n3:18:36.160 --> 3:18:40.320\n kind of a digging stick but not the plow.\n\n3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:43.720\n Well the world changed a lot with that, right?\n\n3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:54.200\n And a few of the changes that at least some theorists believe in is when the ox drawn\n\n3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:57.840\n plow started to proliferate, any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually\n\n3:18:57.840 --> 3:19:01.080\n cultivate grain because just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it\n\n3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:04.520\n to matter, grain was a storable caloric surplus, they could make it through the famines, they\n\n3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:08.400\n could grow their population, so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate\n\n3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:14.440\n and everybody used it, that corresponding with the use of a plow, animism went away\n\n3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:18.720\n everywhere that it existed because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while\n\n3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:23.840\n beating the cow all day long to pull the plow, so the moment that we do animal husbandry\n\n3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:27.440\n of that kind where you have to beat the cow all day, you have to say it's just a dumb\n\n3:19:27.440 --> 3:19:30.640\n animal, man has dominion over earth and the nature of even our religious and spiritual\n\n3:19:30.640 --> 3:19:31.880\n ideas change.\n\n3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:37.080\n You went from women primarily using the digging stick to do the horticulture or gathering\n\n3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:40.920\n before that, men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the plow because the upper\n\n3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:44.000\n body strength actually really mattered, women would have miscarriages when they would do\n\n3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:48.160\n it when they were pregnant, so all the caloric supply started to come from men where it had\n\n3:19:48.160 --> 3:19:52.880\n been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods\n\n3:19:52.880 --> 3:19:54.920\n following that.\n\n3:19:54.920 --> 3:20:01.800\n Obviously we went from very, that particular line of thought then also says that feminism\n\n3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:09.880\n followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism in the West started to follow women\n\n3:20:09.880 --> 3:20:15.440\n being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential\n\n3:20:15.440 --> 3:20:20.760\n once the internal combustion engine was much stronger and we can drive a tractor.\n\n3:20:20.760 --> 3:20:26.160\n So I don't think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea, so I think this\n\n3:20:26.160 --> 3:20:33.080\n is a reductionist view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values\n\n3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:35.040\n agnostic is silly.\n\n3:20:35.040 --> 3:20:39.160\n Technology codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior\n\n3:20:39.160 --> 3:20:40.560\n and believing in them.\n\n3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:44.640\n The plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene, right, it was the beginning of us changing\n\n3:20:44.640 --> 3:20:49.340\n the environment radically to clear cut areas to just make them useful for people which\n\n3:20:49.340 --> 3:20:54.180\n also meant the change of the view of where the web of life were just a part of it, etc.\n\n3:20:54.180 --> 3:20:57.360\n So all those types of things.\n\n3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:02.480\n That's brilliantly put, by the way, that was just brilliant.\n\n3:21:02.480 --> 3:21:05.960\n But the question is, so it's not agnostic, but...\n\n3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:10.480\n So we have to look at what the psychological effects of specific tech applied certain ways\n\n3:21:10.480 --> 3:21:17.280\n are and be able to say it's not just doing the first order thing you intended, it's doing\n\n3:21:17.280 --> 3:21:23.200\n like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal culture in the beginning\n\n3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:26.000\n of empire and the class systems that came with that.\n\n3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:28.720\n We can go on and on about what the plow did.\n\n3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:32.320\n The beginning of surplus was inheritance, which then became the capital model and like\n\n3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:34.580\n lots of things.\n\n3:21:34.580 --> 3:21:39.820\n So we have to say when we're looking at the tech, what are the values built into the way\n\n3:21:39.820 --> 3:21:42.200\n the tech is being built that are not obvious?\n\n3:21:42.200 --> 3:21:44.480\n Right, so you always have to consider externalities.\n\n3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:45.480\n Yes.\n\n3:21:45.480 --> 3:21:48.560\n And the externalities are not just physical to the environment, they're also to how the\n\n3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:51.880\n people are being conditioned and how the relationality between them is being conditioned.\n\n3:21:51.880 --> 3:21:56.740\n So the question I'm asking you, so I personally would rather be led by a plow and a tractor\n\n3:21:56.740 --> 3:21:58.880\n than Stalin, okay?\n\n3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:02.640\n That's the question I'm asking you.\n\n3:22:02.640 --> 3:22:09.400\n In creating an emergent government where people, where there's a democracy that's dynamic,\n\n3:22:09.400 --> 3:22:19.520\n that makes choices, that does governance at like a very kind of liquid, there's a bunch\n\n3:22:19.520 --> 3:22:26.540\n of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales, right?\n\n3:22:26.540 --> 3:22:32.080\n And doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate\n\n3:22:32.080 --> 3:22:34.320\n and impose rule, okay?\n\n3:22:34.320 --> 3:22:35.480\n That's the Stalin version.\n\n3:22:35.480 --> 3:22:48.040\n I'm saying isn't the alternative that's emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and\n\n3:22:48.040 --> 3:22:54.100\n the tractor, which is the modern version of that, is like the internet, the digital space\n\n3:22:54.100 --> 3:23:00.040\n where we can, the monetary system where you have the currency and so on, but you have\n\n3:23:00.040 --> 3:23:03.840\n much more importantly, to me at least, is just basic social interaction, the mechanisms\n\n3:23:03.840 --> 3:23:08.240\n of human transacting with each other in the space of ideas, isn't?\n\n3:23:08.240 --> 3:23:12.240\n So yes, it's not agnostic, definitely not agnostic.\n\n3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:14.320\n You've had a brilliant rant there.\n\n3:23:14.320 --> 3:23:20.280\n The tractor has effects, but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system of governance?\n\n3:23:20.280 --> 3:23:26.720\n Yes, but I wouldn't say we're on track.\n\n3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:28.160\n You haven't seen anything promising.\n\n3:23:28.160 --> 3:23:32.720\n It's not that I haven't seen anything promising, it's that to be on track requires understanding\n\n3:23:32.720 --> 3:23:36.720\n and guiding some of the things differently than is currently happening and it's possible.\n\n3:23:36.720 --> 3:23:38.800\n That's actually what I really care about.\n\n3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:46.520\n So you couldn't have had a Stalin without having certain technologies emerge.\n\n3:23:46.520 --> 3:23:51.040\n He couldn't have ruled such a big area without transportation technologies, without the train,\n\n3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:55.200\n without the communication tech that made it possible.\n\n3:23:55.200 --> 3:24:00.280\n So when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow than a Stalin, there's a relationship\n\n3:24:00.280 --> 3:24:08.640\n between them that is more recursive, which is new physical technologies allow rulers\n\n3:24:08.640 --> 3:24:14.120\n to rule with more power over larger distances historically.\n\n3:24:14.120 --> 3:24:19.520\n And some things are more responsible for that than others.\n\n3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:23.860\n Like Stalin also ate stuff for breakfast, but the thing he ate for breakfast is less\n\n3:24:23.860 --> 3:24:28.220\n responsible for the starvation of millions than the train.\n\n3:24:28.220 --> 3:24:32.480\n The train is more responsible for that and then the weapons of war are more responsible.\n\n3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:38.120\n So some technology, let's not throw it all in the, you're saying like technology has\n\n3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:42.040\n a responsibility here, but some is better than others.\n\n3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:46.280\n I'm saying that people's use of technology will change their behavior.\n\n3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:48.880\n So it has behavioral dispositions built in.\n\n3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:52.160\n The change of the behavior will also change the values in the society.\n\n3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:53.480\n It's very complicated, right?\n\n3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:58.580\n It will also, as a result, both make people who have different kinds of predispositions\n\n3:24:58.580 --> 3:25:03.420\n with regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities.\n\n3:25:03.420 --> 3:25:06.440\n And so we have to think about these things.\n\n3:25:06.440 --> 3:25:12.080\n It's kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism ended\n\n3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:15.800\n feudalism and created kind of nation states.\n\n3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:22.240\n So one thing I would say as a long trend that we can look at is that whenever there is a\n\n3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:27.560\n step function, a major leap in technology, physical technology, the underlying techno\n\n3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:33.080\n industrial base with which we do stuff, it ends up coding for, it ends up predisposing\n\n3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:38.640\n a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social system had not emerged\n\n3:25:38.640 --> 3:25:40.560\n to try to solve.\n\n3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:44.400\n And so it usually ends up breaking the previous social systems, the way the plow broke the\n\n3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:48.360\n tribal system, the way that the industrial revolution broke the feudal system, and then\n\n3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:54.200\n new social systems have to emerge so they can deal with the new powers, the new dispositions,\n\n3:25:54.200 --> 3:25:55.200\n whatever with that tech.\n\n3:25:55.200 --> 3:26:00.360\n Obviously, the nuke broke nation state governance being adequate and said, we can't ever have\n\n3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:01.360\n that again.\n\n3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:06.800\n So then it created this international governance apparatus world.\n\n3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:21.600\n So I guess what I'm saying is that the solution is not exponential tech following the current\n\n3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:26.400\n path of what the market incentivizes exponential tech to do, market being a previous social\n\n3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:28.160\n tech.\n\n3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:38.760\n I would say that exponential tech, if we look at different types of social tech, so let's\n\n3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:46.680\n just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing, right?\n\n3:26:46.680 --> 3:26:56.360\n At least that's the story, and which is, and this is why if you look, this important part\n\n3:26:56.360 --> 3:26:57.360\n to build first.\n\n3:26:57.360 --> 3:26:58.360\n It's kind of doing it.\n\n3:26:58.360 --> 3:26:59.360\n It's just doing it poorly.\n\n3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:03.120\n You're saying, I mean, that's, it is emergent order in some sense.\n\n3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:06.200\n I mean, that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government.\n\n3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.200\n Correct.\n\n3:27:07.200 --> 3:27:11.260\n I mean, I said at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves\n\n3:27:11.260 --> 3:27:12.260\n early on.\n\n3:27:12.260 --> 3:27:14.560\n It doesn't do it for all classes equally, et cetera.\n\n3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:20.720\n But the idea of democracy is that, is participatory governance.\n\n3:27:20.720 --> 3:27:26.160\n And so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the European enlightenment\n\n3:27:26.160 --> 3:27:31.240\n and specifically because the idea that a lot of people, some huge number, not a tribal\n\n3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:34.560\n number, a huge number of anonymous people who don't know each other, are not bonded\n\n3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:38.680\n to each other, who believe different things, who grew up in different ways, can all work\n\n3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:42.560\n together to make collective decisions, well, that affect everybody, and where some of them\n\n3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:46.560\n will make compromises and the thing that matters to them for what matters to other strangers.\n\n3:27:46.560 --> 3:27:47.560\n That's actually wild.\n\n3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:50.820\n Like it's a wild idea that that would even be possible.\n\n3:27:50.820 --> 3:27:57.400\n And it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we could all do the\n\n3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:03.000\n philosophy of science and we could all do the Hegelian dialectic.\n\n3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:04.400\n Those ideas had emerged, right?\n\n3:28:04.400 --> 3:28:11.400\n And it was that we could all, so our choice making, because we said a society is trying\n\n3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:15.520\n to coordinate choice making, the emergent order is the order of the choices that we're\n\n3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:18.960\n making, not just at the level of the individuals, but what groups of individuals, corporations,\n\n3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:21.560\n nations, states, whatever do.\n\n3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:25.440\n Our choices are based on, our choice making is based on our sense making and our meaning\n\n3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:26.440\n making.\n\n3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:30.040\n Our sense making is what do we believe is happening in the world, and what do we believe\n\n3:28:30.040 --> 3:28:31.620\n the effects of a particular thing would be.\n\n3:28:31.620 --> 3:28:34.620\n Our meaning making is what do we care about, right, our values generation, what do we care\n\n3:28:34.620 --> 3:28:37.280\n about that we're trying to move the world in the direction of.\n\n3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:41.560\n If you ultimately are trying to move the world in a direction that is really, really different\n\n3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:44.920\n than the direction I'm trying to, we have very different values, we're gonna have a\n\n3:28:44.920 --> 3:28:46.140\n hard time.\n\n3:28:46.140 --> 3:28:51.160\n And if you think the world is a very different world, right, if you think that systemic racism\n\n3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:56.040\n is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems, and I think it's not even a thing,\n\n3:28:56.040 --> 3:29:00.440\n if you think climate change is almost existential, and I think it's not even a thing, we're gonna\n\n3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:02.800\n have a really hard time coordinating.\n\n3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:07.220\n And so, we have to be able to have shared sense making of can we come to understand\n\n3:29:07.220 --> 3:29:12.920\n just what is happening together, and then can we do shared values generation, okay?\n\n3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:17.360\n Maybe I'm emphasizing a particular value more than you, but I can take your perspective\n\n3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:21.520\n and I can see how the thing that you value is worth valuing, and I can see how it's affected\n\n3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:22.520\n by this thing.\n\n3:29:22.520 --> 3:29:25.980\n So, can we take all the values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all\n\n3:29:25.980 --> 3:29:30.020\n of them better than the proposition I created just to benefit these ones that harms the\n\n3:29:30.020 --> 3:29:34.380\n ones that you care about, which is why you're opposing my proposition?\n\n3:29:34.380 --> 3:29:39.400\n We don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently to see, and this is\n\n3:29:39.400 --> 3:29:43.480\n the reason that the proposition we vote on, it gets half the votes almost all the time.\n\n3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:47.580\n It almost never gets 90% of the votes, is because it benefits some things and harms\n\n3:29:47.580 --> 3:29:48.580\n other things.\n\n3:29:48.580 --> 3:29:52.640\n We can say all theory of trade offs, but we didn't even try to say, could we see what\n\n3:29:52.640 --> 3:29:55.840\n everybody cares about and see if there is a better solution?\n\n3:29:55.840 --> 3:29:56.840\n So...\n\n3:29:56.840 --> 3:29:57.840\n How do we fix that try?\n\n3:29:57.840 --> 3:30:01.960\n I wonder, is it as simple as the social technology of education?\n\n3:30:01.960 --> 3:30:02.960\n Yes.\n\n3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:03.960\n Well, no.\n\n3:30:03.960 --> 3:30:10.320\n I mean, the proposition crafting and refinement process has to be key to a democracy or participatory\n\n3:30:10.320 --> 3:30:11.960\n governance, and it's not currently.\n\n3:30:11.960 --> 3:30:16.920\n But isn't that the humans creating that situation?\n\n3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:20.120\n So one way, there's two ways to fix that.\n\n3:30:20.120 --> 3:30:24.200\n One is to fix the individual humans, which is the education early in life, and the second\n\n3:30:24.200 --> 3:30:26.240\n is to create somehow systems that...\n\n3:30:26.240 --> 3:30:28.120\n Yeah, it's both.\n\n3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:33.820\n So I understand the education part, but creating systems, that's why I mentioned the technologies\n\n3:30:33.820 --> 3:30:36.240\n is creating social networks, essentially.\n\n3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:37.560\n Yes, that's actually necessary.\n\n3:30:37.560 --> 3:30:42.000\n Okay, so let's go to the first part and then we'll come to the second part.\n\n3:30:42.000 --> 3:30:49.120\n So democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we could all do a dialectic and\n\n3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:55.160\n come to understand what other people valued, and so that we could actually come up with\n\n3:30:55.160 --> 3:31:00.520\n a cooperative solution rather than just, fuck you, we're gonna get our thing in war, right?\n\n3:31:00.520 --> 3:31:01.520\n And that we could sense make together.\n\n3:31:01.520 --> 3:31:05.160\n We could all apply the philosophy of science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on\n\n3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:08.360\n what the speed of sound is if we measured it and we found out what it was, and there's\n\n3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:12.040\n a unifying element to the objectivity in that way.\n\n3:31:12.040 --> 3:31:17.240\n And so this is why I believe Jefferson said, if you could give me a perfect newspaper and\n\n3:31:17.240 --> 3:31:21.000\n a broken government, or in paraphrasing, a broken government and perfect newspaper, I\n\n3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:22.640\n wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect newspaper.\n\n3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:26.000\n Because if the people understand what's going on, they can build a new government.\n\n3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:30.080\n If they don't understand what's going on, they can't possibly make good choices.\n\n3:31:30.080 --> 3:31:36.200\n And Washington, I'm paraphrasing again, first president said the number one aim of the federal\n\n3:31:36.200 --> 3:31:41.400\n government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen and the science of government.\n\n3:31:41.400 --> 3:31:42.820\n Science of government was the term of art.\n\n3:31:42.820 --> 3:31:44.020\n Think about what that means, right?\n\n3:31:44.020 --> 3:31:49.640\n Science of government would be game theory, coordination theory, history, wouldn't call\n\n3:31:49.640 --> 3:31:53.660\n game theory yet, history, sociology, economics, right?\n\n3:31:53.660 --> 3:31:57.320\n All the things that lead to how we understand human coordination.\n\n3:31:57.320 --> 3:32:02.040\n I think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government\n\n3:32:02.040 --> 3:32:04.360\n is rule of law.\n\n3:32:04.360 --> 3:32:07.400\n And he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies.\n\n3:32:07.400 --> 3:32:11.560\n Because if the number one aim was to protect the border from enemies, it could do that\n\n3:32:11.560 --> 3:32:14.560\n as a military dictatorship quite effectively.\n\n3:32:14.560 --> 3:32:21.000\n And if the goal was rule of law, it could do it as a dictatorship, as a police state.\n\n3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:24.840\n And so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of\n\n3:32:24.840 --> 3:32:28.300\n all the citizens and the science of government, it won't stay democracy long.\n\n3:32:28.300 --> 3:32:33.080\n You can see, so both education and the fourth estate, the fourth estate being the...\n\n3:32:33.080 --> 3:32:34.760\n So education, can I make sense of the world?\n\n3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:36.080\n Am I trained to make sense of the world?\n\n3:32:36.080 --> 3:32:38.700\n The fourth estate is what's actually going on currently, the news.\n\n3:32:38.700 --> 3:32:41.440\n Do I have good, unbiased information about it?\n\n3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:46.620\n Those are both considered prerequisite institutions for democracy to even be a possibility.\n\n3:32:46.620 --> 3:32:51.760\n And then at the scale it was initially suggested here, the town hall was the key phenomena\n\n3:32:51.760 --> 3:32:55.920\n where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a proposition, and the first thing\n\n3:32:55.920 --> 3:32:59.640\n I ever saw was the proposition, didn't know anything about it, and I got to vote yes or\n\n3:32:59.640 --> 3:33:00.640\n no.\n\n3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:03.600\n It was in the town hall, we all got to talk about it, and the proposition could get crafted\n\n3:33:03.600 --> 3:33:08.340\n in real time through the conversation, which is why there was that founding fathers statement\n\n3:33:08.340 --> 3:33:11.100\n that voting is the death of democracy.\n\n3:33:11.100 --> 3:33:16.180\n Voting fundamentally is polarizing the population in some kind of sublimated war.\n\n3:33:16.180 --> 3:33:19.480\n And we'll do that as the last step, but what we wanna do first is to say, how does the\n\n3:33:19.480 --> 3:33:23.920\n thing that you care about that seems damaged by this proposition, how could that turn into\n\n3:33:23.920 --> 3:33:26.080\n a solution to make this proposition better?\n\n3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:29.120\n Where this proposition still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to\n\n3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:30.120\n that better.\n\n3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:31.120\n Can we work on this together?\n\n3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:33.000\n And in a town hall, we could have that.\n\n3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.720\n As the scale increased, we lost the ability to do that.\n\n3:33:35.720 --> 3:33:38.000\n Now, as you mentioned, the internet could change that.\n\n3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:41.800\n The fact that we had representatives that had to ride a horse from one town hall to\n\n3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:47.800\n the other one to see what the colony would do, that we stopped having this kind of developmental\n\n3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:52.000\n propositional development process when the town hall ended.\n\n3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:58.480\n The fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between insane\n\n3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:03.920\n and aligned with class interests.\n\n3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:08.920\n I would push back to say that the internet has those things, it just has a lot of other\n\n3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:09.920\n things.\n\n3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:16.040\n I feel like the internet has places where that encourage synthesis of competing ideas\n\n3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:19.960\n and sense making, which is what we're talking about.\n\n3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:24.840\n It's just that it's also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing\n\n3:34:24.840 --> 3:34:29.040\n it under current incentives, perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market.\n\n3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:30.040\n Sure.\n\n3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:32.040\n Linux is awesome, right?\n\n3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:36.320\n And Wikipedia and places where you have, and they have problems, but places where you have\n\n3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:41.760\n open source sharing of information, vetting of information towards collective building.\n\n3:34:41.760 --> 3:34:48.040\n Is that building something like, how much has that affected our court systems or our\n\n3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:50.600\n policing systems or our military systems or our?\n\n3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:53.640\n First of all, I think a lot, but not enough.\n\n3:34:53.640 --> 3:34:59.360\n I think this is something I told you offline yesterday as a, perhaps as a whole nother\n\n3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:05.360\n discussion, but I don't think we're quite quantifying the impact on the world, the positive\n\n3:35:05.360 --> 3:35:08.000\n impact of Wikipedia.\n\n3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:16.880\n You said the policing, I mean, I just, I just think the amount of empathy that like knowledge\n\n3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:25.480\n I think can't help, but lead to empathy, just knowing, okay.\n\n3:35:25.480 --> 3:35:26.480\n Just knowing.\n\n3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:27.480\n Okay.\n\n3:35:27.480 --> 3:35:30.900\n I'll give you some pieces of information, knowing how many people died in various wars\n\n3:35:30.900 --> 3:35:35.940\n that already that Delta, when you have millions of people have that knowledge, it's like,\n\n3:35:35.940 --> 3:35:41.680\n it's a little like slap in the face, like, Oh, like my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking\n\n3:35:41.680 --> 3:35:47.480\n up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people were tortured, you know, like just\n\n3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:48.480\n a little bit.\n\n3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:54.160\n And when a lot of people know that because of Wikipedia, uh, or the effect, their second\n\n3:35:54.160 --> 3:35:58.880\n order effects of Wikipedia, which is it's not that necessarily people read Wikipedia.\n\n3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:07.040\n It's like YouTubers who don't really know stuff that well will thoroughly read a Wikipedia\n\n3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:11.740\n article and create a compelling video describing that Wikipedia article that then millions\n\n3:36:11.740 --> 3:36:14.640\n of people watch and they understand that.\n\n3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:15.640\n Holy shit.\n\n3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:18.560\n A lot of, there was such, first of all, there was such a thing as world war II and world\n\n3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:19.560\n war I.\n\n3:36:19.560 --> 3:36:20.560\n Okay.\n\n3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:22.720\n Like they can at least like learn about it.\n\n3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:25.520\n They can learn about this was like recent.\n\n3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:26.560\n They can learn about slavery.\n\n3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:30.220\n They can learn about all kinds of injustices in the world.\n\n3:36:30.220 --> 3:36:36.880\n And that I think has a lot of effects to our, to the way, whether you're a police officer,\n\n3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:46.320\n a lawyer, a judge in the jury, or just the regular civilian citizen, the way you approach\n\n3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:52.040\n the every other communication you engage in, even if the system of that communication is\n\n3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:53.040\n very much flawed.\n\n3:36:53.040 --> 3:36:56.000\n So I think there's a huge positive effect on Wikipedia.\n\n3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:57.000\n That's my case for Wikipedia.\n\n3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:58.800\n So you should donate to Wikipedia.\n\n3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:04.840\n I mean, I'm a huge fan, but there's very few systems like it, which is sad to me.\n\n3:37:04.840 --> 3:37:14.040\n So I think it's, it would be a useful exercise for any, uh, listener of the show to really\n\n3:37:14.040 --> 3:37:21.640\n try to run the dialectical synthesis process with regard to a topic like this and take\n\n3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:29.840\n the, um, techno concerned perspective with regard to, uh, information tech that folks\n\n3:37:29.840 --> 3:37:35.960\n like Tristan Harris take and say, what are all of the things that are getting worse and\n\n3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:39.920\n what, and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much worse, how quickly could\n\n3:37:39.920 --> 3:37:42.680\n that be?\n\n3:37:42.680 --> 3:37:48.600\n And then, and do that fully without mitigating it, then take the techno optimist perspective\n\n3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:53.660\n and see what things are getting better in a way that Kurzweil or Diamandis or someone\n\n3:37:53.660 --> 3:37:59.460\n might do and try to take that perspective fully and say, are some of those things exponential?\n\n3:37:59.460 --> 3:38:00.460\n What could that portend?\n\n3:38:00.460 --> 3:38:03.700\n And then try to hold all that at the same time.\n\n3:38:03.700 --> 3:38:10.780\n And I think there are ways in which, depending upon the metrics we're looking at, things\n\n3:38:10.780 --> 3:38:15.120\n are getting worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different\n\n3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:20.920\n metrics at the same time, which I hold as the destabilization of previous system and\n\n3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:27.380\n either an emergence to a better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible.\n\n3:38:27.380 --> 3:38:32.100\n And so I want my optimism not to be about my assessment.\n\n3:38:32.100 --> 3:38:35.360\n I want my assessment to be just as fucking clear as it can be.\n\n3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:41.240\n I want my optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that clear assessment.\n\n3:38:41.240 --> 3:38:45.680\n So I never want to apply optimism in the sense making.\n\n3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:47.600\n I want to just try to be clear.\n\n3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:52.640\n If anything, I want to make sure that the challenges are really well understood.\n\n3:38:52.640 --> 3:38:57.880\n But that's in service of an optimism that there are good potentials, even if I don't\n\n3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:02.240\n know what they are, that are worth seeking.\n\n3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:07.580\n There is some sense of optimism that's required to even try to innovate really hard problems.\n\n3:39:07.580 --> 3:39:12.400\n But then I want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see, is that solution\n\n3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:13.400\n not going to work?\n\n3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:14.680\n Does it have second order effects?\n\n3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:19.660\n And then not get upset by that because I then come back to how to make it better.\n\n3:39:19.660 --> 3:39:24.320\n So just a relationship between optimism and pessimism and the dialectic of how they can\n\n3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:25.320\n work.\n\n3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:32.600\n So when I, of course, we can say that Wikipedia is a pretty awesome example of a thing.\n\n3:39:32.600 --> 3:39:40.080\n We can look at the places where it has limits or has failed, where on a celebrity topic\n\n3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:45.760\n or corporate interest topic, you can pay Wikipedia editors to edit more frequently and various\n\n3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:46.760\n things like that.\n\n3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:51.320\n But you can also see where there's a lot of information that was kind of decentrally created\n\n3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:54.760\n that is good information that is more easily accessible to people than everybody buying\n\n3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:58.700\n their own encyclopedia Britannica or walking down to the library and that can be updated\n\n3:39:58.700 --> 3:40:01.560\n in real time faster.\n\n3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:09.480\n And I think you're very right that the business model is a big difference because Wikipedia\n\n3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:11.520\n is not a for profit corporation.\n\n3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:17.100\n It is a \u2013 it's tending to the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other\n\n3:40:17.100 --> 3:40:19.960\n than tending to the information commons.\n\n3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:25.760\n And I think the two masters issue is a tricky one when I'm trying to optimize for very different\n\n3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:32.560\n kinds of things where I have to sacrifice one for the other and I can't find synergistic\n\n3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:33.560\n satisfiers.\n\n3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:34.560\n Which one?\n\n3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:40.440\n And if I have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder profit maximization and, you know,\n\n3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:43.400\n what does that end up creating?\n\n3:40:43.400 --> 3:40:50.320\n I think the ad model that Silicon Valley took, I think Jaron Laney or I don't know if you've\n\n3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:56.400\n had him on the show, but he has an interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model.\n\n3:40:56.400 --> 3:41:03.120\n Silicon Valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but also\n\n3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:07.700\n the belief that information should be free and also the network dynamics where the more\n\n3:41:07.700 --> 3:41:12.320\n people you got on, you got increased value per user, per capita as more people got on\n\n3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:15.480\n so you didn't want to do anything to slow the rate of adoption.\n\n3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:20.520\n Some places actually, you know, PayPal paying people money to join the network because the\n\n3:41:20.520 --> 3:41:24.360\n value of the network would be, there'd be a Metcalf like dynamic proportional to the\n\n3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:26.720\n square of the total number of users.\n\n3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:33.080\n So the ad model made sense of how do we make it free but also be a business, get everybody\n\n3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:38.720\n on but not really thinking about what it would mean to \u2013 and this is now the whole idea\n\n3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:44.200\n that if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product.\n\n3:41:44.200 --> 3:41:47.760\n If they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder to maximize profit, their\n\n3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:54.440\n customer is the advertiser, the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral mod for\n\n3:41:54.440 --> 3:42:00.280\n them for advertisers, that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech could have\n\n3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:05.760\n been if applied with a different business model or different purpose.\n\n3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:14.640\n I think because Facebook and Google and other information and communication platforms end\n\n3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:19.600\n up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are in\n\n3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:27.680\n a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information than\n\n3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:31.840\n even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in a different setting,\n\n3:42:31.840 --> 3:42:35.160\n they basically are accessing privileged information.\n\n3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:38.280\n There should be a fiduciary responsibility.\n\n3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:45.720\n And in normal fiduciary law, if there's this principal agent thing, if you are a principal\n\n3:42:45.720 --> 3:42:49.600\n and I'm an agent on your behalf, I don't have a game theoretic relationship with you.\n\n3:42:49.600 --> 3:42:53.040\n If you're sharing something with me and I'm the priest or I'm the therapist, I'm never\n\n3:42:53.040 --> 3:42:58.400\n going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is.\n\n3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:03.040\n But Facebook is gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to\n\n3:43:03.040 --> 3:43:07.000\n modify people's behavior for a behavior that they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior\n\n3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:08.720\n but what the corporation did.\n\n3:43:08.720 --> 3:43:14.720\n So I think this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous\n\n3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:18.520\n social tech where it's being shaped in particular ways.\n\n3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:25.040\n And here, unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the information commons, this evolved for\n\n3:43:25.040 --> 3:43:26.880\n fulfilling particular agentic purpose.\n\n3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:29.600\n Most people when they're on Facebook think it's just a tool that they're using.\n\n3:43:29.600 --> 3:43:31.160\n They don't realize it's an agent, right?\n\n3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:37.160\n It is a corporation with a profit motive and as I'm interacting with it, it has a goal\n\n3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:40.080\n for me different than my goal for myself.\n\n3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:41.760\n And I might want to be on for a short period of time.\n\n3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:43.760\n Its goal is maximize time on site.\n\n3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:49.920\n And so there is a rivalry where there should be a fiduciary contract.\n\n3:43:49.920 --> 3:43:52.680\n I think that's actually a huge deal.\n\n3:43:52.680 --> 3:44:05.520\n And I think if we said, could we apply Facebook like technology to develop people's citizenry\n\n3:44:05.520 --> 3:44:06.520\n capacity, right?\n\n3:44:06.520 --> 3:44:13.320\n To develop their personal health and wellbeing and habits as well as their cognitive understanding,\n\n3:44:13.320 --> 3:44:20.240\n the complexity with which they can process the health of their relationships, that would\n\n3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:22.320\n be amazing to start to explore.\n\n3:44:22.320 --> 3:44:28.480\n And this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is a\n\n3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:33.920\n major step function in the physical tech, it obsoletes the previous social tech and\n\n3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:36.880\n the new social tech has to emerge.\n\n3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:41.600\n What I would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the world today, the\n\n3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:47.160\n more top down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to emerge,\n\n3:44:47.160 --> 3:44:52.480\n the digital technology started to emerge, they were in a position for better long term\n\n3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:55.480\n planning and better coordination.\n\n3:44:55.480 --> 3:44:59.480\n And so the authoritarian states started applying the exponential tech intentionally to make\n\n3:44:59.480 --> 3:45:01.940\n more effective authoritarian states.\n\n3:45:01.940 --> 3:45:07.320\n And that's everything from like an internet of things surveillance system going into machine\n\n3:45:07.320 --> 3:45:11.760\n learning systems to the Sesame credit system to all those types of things.\n\n3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:16.360\n And so they're upgrading their social tech using the exponential tech.\n\n3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:23.760\n Otherwise within a nation state like the US, but democratic open societies, the countries,\n\n3:45:23.760 --> 3:45:28.240\n the states are not directing the technology in a way that makes a better open society,\n\n3:45:28.240 --> 3:45:30.160\n meaning better emergent order.\n\n3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:34.320\n They're saying, well, the corporations are doing that and the state is doing the relatively\n\n3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:37.960\n little thing it would do aligned with the previous corporate law that no longer is relevant\n\n3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:40.560\n because there wasn't fiduciary responsibility for things like that.\n\n3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:45.640\n There wasn't antitrust because this creates functional monopolies because of network dynamics,\n\n3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:46.640\n right?\n\n3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:50.640\n Where YouTube has more users than Vimeo and every other video player together.\n\n3:45:50.640 --> 3:45:54.640\n Amazon has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together.\n\n3:45:54.640 --> 3:46:00.120\n You get one big dog per vertical because of network effect, which is a kind of organic\n\n3:46:00.120 --> 3:46:05.120\n monopoly that the previous antitrust law didn't even have a place, that wasn't a thing.\n\n3:46:05.120 --> 3:46:11.600\n Antimonopoly was only something that emerged in the space of government contracts.\n\n3:46:11.600 --> 3:46:15.920\n So what we see is that the new exponential technology is being directed by authoritarian\n\n3:46:15.920 --> 3:46:19.280\n nation states to make better authoritarian nation states and by corporations to make\n\n3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:21.720\n more powerful corporations.\n\n3:46:21.720 --> 3:46:25.440\n Powerful corporations, when we think about the Scottish enlightenment, when the idea\n\n3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:31.520\n of markets was being advanced, the modern kind of ideas of markets, the biggest corporation\n\n3:46:31.520 --> 3:46:35.040\n was tiny compared to what the biggest corporation today is.\n\n3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:39.080\n So the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny.\n\n3:46:39.080 --> 3:46:43.640\n And the asymmetry now in terms of the total technology it employs, total amount of money,\n\n3:46:43.640 --> 3:46:48.920\n total amount of information processing is so many orders of magnitude.\n\n3:46:48.920 --> 3:46:55.800\n And rather than there be demand for an authentic thing that creates a basis for supply, as\n\n3:46:55.800 --> 3:46:59.760\n supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the demand wasn't coordinated\n\n3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:03.120\n because you don't have a labor union of all the customers working together, but you do\n\n3:47:03.120 --> 3:47:05.160\n have a coordination on the supply side.\n\n3:47:05.160 --> 3:47:08.040\n Supply started to recognize that it could manufacture demand.\n\n3:47:08.040 --> 3:47:10.880\n It could make people want shit that they didn't want before that maybe wouldn't increase their\n\n3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:14.400\n happiness in a meaningful way, might increase addiction.\n\n3:47:14.400 --> 3:47:17.600\n Addiction is a very good way to manufacture demand.\n\n3:47:17.600 --> 3:47:23.640\n And so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and you have\n\n3:47:23.640 --> 3:47:28.860\n to have it for status or whatever it is, the intelligence of the market was breaking.\n\n3:47:28.860 --> 3:47:32.960\n Now it's no longer a collective intelligence system that is up regulating real desire for\n\n3:47:32.960 --> 3:47:34.280\n things that are really meaningful.\n\n3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:38.160\n We were able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather than the higher ones.\n\n3:47:38.160 --> 3:47:42.040\n The addictive patterns drive those and have people want shit that doesn't actually make\n\n3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:44.340\n them happy or make the world better.\n\n3:47:44.340 --> 3:47:51.100\n And so we really also have to update our theory of markets because behavioral econ showed\n\n3:47:51.100 --> 3:47:55.960\n that homo economicus, the rational actor is not really a thing, but particularly at greater\n\n3:47:55.960 --> 3:47:58.560\n and greater scale can't really be a thing.\n\n3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:02.840\n Voluntaryism isn't a thing where if my company doesn't want to advertise on Facebook, I just\n\n3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:06.600\n will lose to the companies that do because that's where all the fucking attention is.\n\n3:48:06.600 --> 3:48:12.040\n And so then I can say it's voluntary, but it's not really if there's a functional monopoly.\n\n3:48:12.040 --> 3:48:14.760\n Same if I'm going to sell on Amazon or things like that.\n\n3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:21.760\n So what I would say is these corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states\n\n3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:24.080\n in some ways.\n\n3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:34.000\n And they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states, the open societies.\n\n3:48:34.000 --> 3:48:38.840\n So the democracies are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of\n\n3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:43.640\n new tech companies that are kind of a new feudalism, tech feudalism, because it's not\n\n3:48:43.640 --> 3:48:48.400\n a democracy inside of a tech company or the supply and demand relationship when you have\n\n3:48:48.400 --> 3:48:53.200\n manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type functions.\n\n3:48:53.200 --> 3:48:57.280\n And so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech and authoritarian nation\n\n3:48:57.280 --> 3:48:58.280\n states controlling it.\n\n3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:01.120\n And those attractors are both shitty.\n\n3:49:01.120 --> 3:49:07.200\n And so I'm interested in the application of exponential tech to making better social tech\n\n3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:13.280\n that makes emergent order possible and where then that emergent order can bind and direct\n\n3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:19.080\n the exponential tech in fundamentally healthy, not X risk oriented directions.\n\n3:49:19.080 --> 3:49:22.680\n I think the relationship of social tech and physical tech can make it.\n\n3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:26.600\n I think we can actually use the physical tech to make better social tech, but it's not given\n\n3:49:26.600 --> 3:49:27.940\n that we do.\n\n3:49:27.940 --> 3:49:32.020\n If we don't make better social tech, then I think the physical tech empowers really\n\n3:49:32.020 --> 3:49:35.040\n shitty social tech that is not a world that we want.\n\n3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:39.520\n I don't know if it's a road we want to go down, but I tend to believe that the market\n\n3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:43.600\n will create exactly the thing you're talking about, which I feel like there's a lot of\n\n3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:55.160\n money to be made in creating a social tech that creates a better citizen, that creates\n\n3:49:55.160 --> 3:50:00.640\n a better human being.\n\n3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:05.740\n Your description of Facebook and so on, which is a system that creates addiction, which\n\n3:50:05.740 --> 3:50:14.600\n manufactures demand, is not obviously inherently the consequence of the markets.\n\n3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:19.200\n I feel like that's the first stage of us, like baby deer trying to figure out how to\n\n3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:20.560\n use the internet.\n\n3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:28.360\n I feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates compersion\n\n3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:29.360\n and love.\n\n3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:30.360\n Honestly.\n\n3:50:30.360 --> 3:50:35.360\n I mean, I really, we can have this, I can make the business case for it.\n\n3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:39.840\n I don't know if, I don't think we want to really have that discussion, but do you have\n\n3:50:39.840 --> 3:50:41.920\n some hope that that's the case?\n\n3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:47.160\n I guess if not, then how do we fix the system of markets that worked so well for the United\n\n3:50:47.160 --> 3:50:49.120\n States for so long?\n\n3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:51.520\n Like I said, every social tech worked for a while.\n\n3:50:51.520 --> 3:50:55.440\n Like tribalism worked well for two or 300,000 years.\n\n3:50:55.440 --> 3:50:58.000\n I think social tech has to keep evolving.\n\n3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:03.360\n The social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to keep evolving\n\n3:51:03.360 --> 3:51:05.860\n as our physical tech does.\n\n3:51:05.860 --> 3:51:12.960\n So I think the thing that we call markets, of course we can try to say, oh, even biology\n\n3:51:12.960 --> 3:51:15.000\n runs on markets.\n\n3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:22.160\n But the thing that we call markets, the underlying theory, homo economicus, demand, driving supply,\n\n3:51:22.160 --> 3:51:23.700\n that thing broke.\n\n3:51:23.700 --> 3:51:28.320\n It broke with scale in particular and a few other things.\n\n3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:32.640\n So it needs updated in a really fundamental way.\n\n3:51:32.640 --> 3:51:37.840\n I think there's something even deeper than making money happening that in some ways will\n\n3:51:37.840 --> 3:51:41.680\n obsolete money making.\n\n3:51:41.680 --> 3:51:46.560\n I think capitalism is not about business.\n\n3:51:46.560 --> 3:51:50.520\n So if you think about business, I'm going to produce a good or a service that people\n\n3:51:50.520 --> 3:51:55.420\n want and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service.\n\n3:51:55.420 --> 3:51:58.840\n That's the world of business, but that's not capitalism.\n\n3:51:58.840 --> 3:52:05.680\n Capitalism is the management and allocation of capital, which financial services was a\n\n3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:09.080\n tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of the total market.\n\n3:52:09.080 --> 3:52:10.440\n It's a different creature.\n\n3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:14.760\n So if I was in business and I was producing a good or service and I was saving up enough\n\n3:52:14.760 --> 3:52:19.340\n money that I started to be able to invest that money and gain interest or do things\n\n3:52:19.340 --> 3:52:24.620\n like that, I start realizing I'm making more money on my money than I'm making on producing\n\n3:52:24.620 --> 3:52:26.160\n the goods and services.\n\n3:52:26.160 --> 3:52:29.960\n So I stop even paying attention to goods and services and start paying attention to making\n\n3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:34.380\n money on money and how do I utilize capital to create more capital.\n\n3:52:34.380 --> 3:52:37.880\n And capital gives me more optionality because I can buy anything with it than a particular\n\n3:52:37.880 --> 3:52:42.880\n good or service that only some people want.\n\n3:52:42.880 --> 3:52:49.540\n Capitalism \u2013 more capital ended up meaning more control.\n\n3:52:49.540 --> 3:52:51.640\n I could put more people under my employment.\n\n3:52:51.640 --> 3:52:57.400\n I could buy larger pieces of land, novel access to resource, mines, and put more technology\n\n3:52:57.400 --> 3:52:58.400\n under my employment.\n\n3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:02.360\n So it meant increased agency and also increased control.\n\n3:53:02.360 --> 3:53:07.740\n I think attentionalism is even more powerful.\n\n3:53:07.740 --> 3:53:14.680\n So rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in\n\n3:53:14.680 --> 3:53:19.120\n the least work they can, there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable\n\n3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:21.800\n than slavery, right?\n\n3:53:21.800 --> 3:53:26.100\n Have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead and nobody\n\n3:53:26.100 --> 3:53:30.740\n has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever.\n\n3:53:30.740 --> 3:53:35.680\n This is a cynical take but a meaningful take.\n\n3:53:35.680 --> 3:53:43.320\n So people \u2013 so capital ends up being a way to influence human behavior, right?\n\n3:53:43.320 --> 3:53:48.680\n And yet where people still feel free in some meaningful way.\n\n3:53:48.680 --> 3:53:53.200\n They're not feeling like they're going to be punished by the state if they don't do\n\n3:53:53.200 --> 3:53:54.200\n something.\n\n3:53:54.200 --> 3:53:56.680\n It's like punished by the market via homelessness or something.\n\n3:53:56.680 --> 3:54:01.420\n But the market is this invisible thing I can't put an agent on so it feels like free.\n\n3:54:01.420 --> 3:54:10.800\n And so if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free, capital ends\n\n3:54:10.800 --> 3:54:12.560\n up being a way to do that.\n\n3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:18.480\n But I think affecting their attention is even deeper because if I can affect their attention,\n\n3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:22.960\n I can both affect what they want and what they believe and what they feel.\n\n3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:24.680\n And we statistically know this very clearly.\n\n3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:29.360\n Facebook has done studies that based on changing the feed, it can change beliefs, emotional\n\n3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:31.640\n dispositions, et cetera.\n\n3:54:31.640 --> 3:54:38.000\n And so I think there's a way that the harvest and directing of attention is even a more\n\n3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:39.840\n powerful system than capitalism.\n\n3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:44.660\n It is effective in capitalism to generate capital, but I think it also generates influence\n\n3:54:44.660 --> 3:54:46.760\n beyond what capital can do.\n\n3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:56.840\n And so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type of tech to direct other people's\n\n3:54:56.840 --> 3:54:57.840\n attention?\n\n3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:03.280\n If so, towards what?\n\n3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:07.320\n Towards what metrics of what a good civilization and good human life would be?\n\n3:55:07.320 --> 3:55:08.920\n What's the oversight process?\n\n3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:09.920\n What is the...\n\n3:55:09.920 --> 3:55:10.920\n Transparency.\n\n3:55:10.920 --> 3:55:14.920\n I can answer all the things you're mentioning.\n\n3:55:14.920 --> 3:55:20.720\n I can build, I guarantee you if I'm not such a lazy ass, I'll be part of the many people\n\n3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:26.360\n doing this as transparency and control, giving control to individual people.\n\n3:55:26.360 --> 3:55:27.360\n Okay.\n\n3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:36.120\n So maybe the corporation has coordination on its goals that all of its customers or\n\n3:55:36.120 --> 3:55:37.660\n users together don't have.\n\n3:55:37.660 --> 3:55:44.880\n So there's some asymmetry of its goals, but maybe I could actually help all of\n\n3:55:44.880 --> 3:55:50.160\n the customers to coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating\n\n3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:54.940\n them adequately about the effects, the externalities on them.\n\n3:55:54.940 --> 3:55:58.080\n This is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the atmosphere.\n\n3:55:58.080 --> 3:56:03.520\n It's their minds, their beings, their families, their relationships, such that they will in\n\n3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:10.920\n group change their behavior.\n\n3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:16.000\n One way of saying what you're saying, I think, is that you think that you can rescue homo\n\n3:56:16.000 --> 3:56:23.180\n economicus from the rational actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose\n\n3:56:23.180 --> 3:56:27.160\n the best one at the best price, the kind of Rand von Mises Hayek, that you can rescue\n\n3:56:27.160 --> 3:56:31.400\n that from Dan Ariely and behavioral econ that says that's actually not how people make choices.\n\n3:56:31.400 --> 3:56:35.200\n They make it based on status hacking, largely whether it's good for them or not in the long\n\n3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:36.360\n term.\n\n3:56:36.360 --> 3:56:41.400\n And the large asymmetric corporation can run propaganda and narrative warfare that hits\n\n3:56:41.400 --> 3:56:46.760\n people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and their lots of other things in ways that\n\n3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:50.000\n they can't even perceive that are happening.\n\n3:56:50.000 --> 3:56:51.480\n They're not paying attention to that.\n\n3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:55.120\n The site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever else.\n\n3:56:55.120 --> 3:57:00.040\n So you're saying, I think we can recover homo economicus.\n\n3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:03.000\n And not just through a single mechanism of technology.\n\n3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:09.880\n There's the, not to keep mentioning the guy, but platforms like Joe Rogan and so on, that\n\n3:57:09.880 --> 3:57:20.160\n make help make viral the ways that the education of negative externalities can become viral\n\n3:57:20.160 --> 3:57:21.160\n in this world.\n\n3:57:21.160 --> 3:57:26.560\n So interestingly, I actually agree with you that\n\n3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:33.360\n I got them that we four and a half hours in that we can take can do some good.\n\n3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:34.360\n All right.\n\n3:57:34.360 --> 3:57:38.760\n Well, see, what you're talking about is the application of tech here, broadcast tech where\n\n3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:40.500\n you can speak to a lot of people.\n\n3:57:40.500 --> 3:57:44.160\n And that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken to differently,\n\n3:57:44.160 --> 3:57:47.120\n which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more\n\n3:57:47.120 --> 3:57:48.260\n like Facebook's tech.\n\n3:57:48.260 --> 3:57:52.040\n But nonetheless, we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then the word\n\n3:57:52.040 --> 3:57:53.920\n of mouth is a powerful thing.\n\n3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:59.440\n You need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like lands a catapult or whatever.\n\n3:57:59.440 --> 3:58:03.720\n I don't know what the right weapon is, but then it just spreads the word of mouth through\n\n3:58:03.720 --> 3:58:06.280\n all kinds of tech, including Facebook.\n\n3:58:06.280 --> 3:58:08.160\n So let's come back to the fundamental thing.\n\n3:58:08.160 --> 3:58:14.660\n The fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting\n\n3:58:14.660 --> 3:58:22.360\n parts of ourself, actually having more harmony than they might have to a family, extended\n\n3:58:22.360 --> 3:58:25.640\n family, local, all the way up to global.\n\n3:58:25.640 --> 3:58:33.640\n We want emergent order where our choices have more alignment, right?\n\n3:58:33.640 --> 3:58:38.360\n We want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than we want fundamentally different\n\n3:58:38.360 --> 3:58:42.680\n things or make totally different sense of the world where warfare of some kind becomes\n\n3:58:42.680 --> 3:58:45.040\n the only solution.\n\n3:58:45.040 --> 3:58:50.680\n Emergent order requires us in our choice making, requires us being able to have related sense\n\n3:58:50.680 --> 3:58:55.160\n making and related meaning making processes.\n\n3:58:55.160 --> 3:59:02.560\n Can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity\n\n3:59:02.560 --> 3:59:06.200\n to do that where the technology called a town hall, the social tech that we'd all get together\n\n3:59:06.200 --> 3:59:11.200\n and talk obviously is very scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than\n\n3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:13.200\n networks of aligned interest.\n\n3:59:13.200 --> 3:59:16.200\n Can we build new better versions of those types of things?\n\n3:59:16.200 --> 3:59:23.280\n And going back to the idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive\n\n3:59:23.280 --> 3:59:27.080\n education and the science of government, which include being able to understand things like\n\n3:59:27.080 --> 3:59:31.520\n asymmetric information warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize\n\n3:59:31.520 --> 3:59:33.360\n adequately.\n\n3:59:33.360 --> 3:59:38.920\n Can you utilize some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive\n\n3:59:38.920 --> 3:59:44.700\n education of the people and maybe comprehensive informativeness, so both fixing the decay\n\n3:59:44.700 --> 3:59:48.480\n in both education and the fourth estate that have happened so that people can start self\n\n3:59:48.480 --> 3:59:55.440\n organizing to then influence the corporations, the nation states to do different things and\n\n3:59:55.440 --> 3:59:57.080\n or build new ones themselves?\n\n3:59:57.080 --> 4:00:00.800\n Yeah, fundamentally that's the thing that has to happen.\n\n4:00:00.800 --> 4:00:05.060\n The exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape that the world never had.\n\n4:00:05.060 --> 4:00:09.480\n The nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required this whole Bretton Woods\n\n4:00:09.480 --> 4:00:10.580\n world.\n\n4:00:10.580 --> 4:00:15.320\n The exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape, our existing problem solving processes\n\n4:00:15.320 --> 4:00:16.620\n aren't doing a good job.\n\n4:00:16.620 --> 4:00:21.360\n We have had more countries get nukes, we have a nuclear de proliferation, we haven't achieved\n\n4:00:21.360 --> 4:00:26.200\n any of the UN sustainable development goals, we haven't kept any of the new categories\n\n4:00:26.200 --> 4:00:30.640\n of tech from making arms races, so our global coordination is not adequate to the problem\n\n4:00:30.640 --> 4:00:32.280\n landscape.\n\n4:00:32.280 --> 4:00:36.540\n So we need fundamentally better problem solving processes, a market or a state is a problem\n\n4:00:36.540 --> 4:00:37.540\n solving process.\n\n4:00:37.540 --> 4:00:41.560\n We need better ones that can do the speed and scale of the current issues.\n\n4:00:41.560 --> 4:00:46.240\n Right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we regulated DDT out of\n\n4:00:46.240 --> 4:00:50.720\n existence or cigarettes not for people under 18, they had already killed so many people\n\n4:00:50.720 --> 4:00:52.980\n and we let the market do the thing.\n\n4:00:52.980 --> 4:00:59.400\n But as Elon has made the point that won't work for AI, by the time we recognize afterwards\n\n4:00:59.400 --> 4:01:02.840\n that we have an auto poetic AI that's a problem, you won't be able to reverse it, that there's\n\n4:01:02.840 --> 4:01:07.760\n a number of things that when you're dealing with tech that is either self replicating\n\n4:01:07.760 --> 4:01:11.800\n and disintermediate humans to keep going, doesn't need humans to keep going, or you\n\n4:01:11.800 --> 4:01:17.720\n have tech that just has exponentially fast effects, your regulation has to come early.\n\n4:01:17.720 --> 4:01:23.240\n It can't come after the effects have happened, the negative effects have happened because\n\n4:01:23.240 --> 4:01:25.480\n the negative effects could be too big too quickly.\n\n4:01:25.480 --> 4:01:31.840\n So we basically need new problem solving processes that do better at being able to internalize\n\n4:01:31.840 --> 4:01:36.160\n this externality, solve the problems on the right time scale and the right geographic\n\n4:01:36.160 --> 4:01:37.900\n scale.\n\n4:01:37.900 --> 4:01:44.480\n And those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting them and\n\n4:01:44.480 --> 4:01:48.400\n being able to participate in their development, which is what I would call kind of a new cultural\n\n4:01:48.400 --> 4:01:54.360\n enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen, where people start understanding the new power\n\n4:01:54.360 --> 4:02:00.480\n that exponential tech offers, the way that it is actually damaging current governance\n\n4:02:00.480 --> 4:02:07.200\n structures that we care about, and creating an extra landscape, but could also be redirected\n\n4:02:07.200 --> 4:02:13.140\n towards more protopic purposes, and then saying, how do we rebuild new social institutions?\n\n4:02:13.140 --> 4:02:17.200\n What are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at scale\n\n4:02:17.200 --> 4:02:19.160\n and time?\n\n4:02:19.160 --> 4:02:24.100\n And how can the people actually participate to build those things?\n\n4:02:24.100 --> 4:02:29.600\n The solution that I see working requires a process like that.\n\n4:02:29.600 --> 4:02:32.360\n And the result maximizes love.\n\n4:02:32.360 --> 4:02:36.200\n So again, Elon would be right that love is the answer.\n\n4:02:36.200 --> 4:02:42.680\n Let me take you back from the scale of societies to the scale that's far, far more important,\n\n4:02:42.680 --> 4:02:47.480\n which is the scale of family.\n\n4:02:47.480 --> 4:02:50.120\n You've written a blog post about your dad.\n\n4:02:50.120 --> 4:02:56.920\n We have various flavors of relationships with our fathers.\n\n4:02:56.920 --> 4:03:01.160\n What have you learned about life from your dad?\n\n4:03:01.160 --> 4:03:06.600\n Well, people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual things that I learned\n\n4:03:06.600 --> 4:03:07.600\n that I really appreciated.\n\n4:03:07.600 --> 4:03:18.520\n If I was to kind of summarize at a high level, I had a really incredible dad, very, very\n\n4:03:18.520 --> 4:03:23.240\n unusually positive set of experiences.\n\n4:03:23.240 --> 4:03:28.880\n We were homeschooled, and he was committed to work from home to be available and prioritize\n\n4:03:28.880 --> 4:03:35.680\n fathering in a really deep way.\n\n4:03:35.680 --> 4:03:41.680\n And as a super gifted, super loving, very unique man, he also had his unique issues\n\n4:03:41.680 --> 4:03:46.040\n that were part of what crafted the unique brilliance, and those things often go together.\n\n4:03:46.040 --> 4:03:52.360\n And I say that because I think I had some unusual gifts and also some unusual difficulties.\n\n4:03:52.360 --> 4:03:59.280\n And I think it's useful for everybody to know their path probably has both of those.\n\n4:03:59.280 --> 4:04:05.880\n But if I was to say kind of the essence of one of the things my dad taught me across\n\n4:04:05.880 --> 4:04:13.320\n a lot of lessons was like the intersection of self empowerment, ideas and practices that\n\n4:04:13.320 --> 4:04:21.160\n self empower, towards collective good, towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self.\n\n4:04:21.160 --> 4:04:25.600\n And he both said that a million different ways, taught it in a million different ways.\n\n4:04:25.600 --> 4:04:31.720\n When we were doing construction and he was teaching me how to build a house, we were\n\n4:04:31.720 --> 4:04:35.380\n putting the wires to the walls before the drywall went on, he made sure that the way\n\n4:04:35.380 --> 4:04:37.720\n that we put the wires through was beautiful.\n\n4:04:37.720 --> 4:04:44.200\n Like that the height of the holes was similar, that we twisted the wires in a particular\n\n4:04:44.200 --> 4:04:45.200\n way.\n\n4:04:45.200 --> 4:04:47.400\n And it's like no one's ever going to see it.\n\n4:04:47.400 --> 4:04:50.760\n And he's like, if a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well, and excellence is its own\n\n4:04:50.760 --> 4:04:51.760\n reward.\n\n4:04:51.760 --> 4:04:52.760\n And those types of ideas.\n\n4:04:52.760 --> 4:04:55.120\n And if there was a really shitty job to do, he'd say, see the job, do the job, stay out\n\n4:04:55.120 --> 4:04:56.120\n of the misery.\n\n4:04:56.120 --> 4:04:59.400\n Just don't indulge any negativity, do the things that need done.\n\n4:04:59.400 --> 4:05:06.440\n And so there's like, there's an empowerment and a nobility together.\n\n4:05:06.440 --> 4:05:10.600\n And yeah, extraordinarily fortunate.\n\n4:05:10.600 --> 4:05:13.960\n Is there ways you think you could have been a better son?\n\n4:05:13.960 --> 4:05:16.640\n Is there things you regret?\n\n4:05:16.640 --> 4:05:18.440\n Interesting question.\n\n4:05:18.440 --> 4:05:28.480\n Let me first say, just as a bit of a criticism, that what kind of man do you think you are\n\n4:05:28.480 --> 4:05:34.360\n not wearing a suit and tie, if a real man should?\n\n4:05:34.360 --> 4:05:36.680\n Exactly I agree with your dad on that point.\n\n4:05:36.680 --> 4:05:44.360\n You mentioned offline that he suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie.\n\n4:05:44.360 --> 4:05:48.600\n But outside of that, is there ways you could have been a better son?\n\n4:05:48.600 --> 4:05:52.600\n Maybe next time on your show, I'll wear a suit and tie.\n\n4:05:52.600 --> 4:06:12.560\n My dad would be happy about that.\n\n4:06:12.560 --> 4:06:17.400\n I can answer the question later in life, not early.\n\n4:06:17.400 --> 4:06:20.680\n I had just a huge amount of respect and reverence for my dad when I was young.\n\n4:06:20.680 --> 4:06:23.920\n So I was asking myself that question a lot.\n\n4:06:23.920 --> 4:06:32.320\n So there weren't a lot of things I knew that I wasn't seeking to apply.\n\n4:06:32.320 --> 4:06:39.160\n There was a phase when I went through my kind of individuation, differentiation, where I\n\n4:06:39.160 --> 4:06:43.280\n had to make him excessively wrong about too many things.\n\n4:06:43.280 --> 4:06:46.200\n I don't think I had to, but I did.\n\n4:06:46.200 --> 4:06:55.600\n And he had a lot of kind of nonstandard model beliefs about things, whether early kind of\n\n4:06:55.600 --> 4:07:03.480\n ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary theory or alternate models of physics.\n\n4:07:03.480 --> 4:07:10.520\n And they weren't irrational, but they didn't all have the standard of epistemic proof that\n\n4:07:10.520 --> 4:07:12.560\n I would need.\n\n4:07:12.560 --> 4:07:19.920\n And I went through, and some of them were kind of spiritual ideas as well, I went through\n\n4:07:19.920 --> 4:07:31.440\n a phase in my early 20s where I kind of had the attitude that Dawkins or a Christopher\n\n4:07:31.440 --> 4:07:41.720\n Hitchens has that can kind of be like excessively certain and sanctimonious, applying their\n\n4:07:41.720 --> 4:07:47.960\n reductionist philosophy of science to everything and kind of brutally dismissive.\n\n4:07:47.960 --> 4:07:52.960\n I'm embarrassed by that phase.\n\n4:07:52.960 --> 4:07:57.040\n Not to say anything about those men and their path, but for myself.\n\n4:07:57.040 --> 4:08:05.080\n And so during that time, I was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than I would have\n\n4:08:05.080 --> 4:08:06.080\n liked to have been.\n\n4:08:06.080 --> 4:08:09.000\n I got to correct that later and apologize for it.\n\n4:08:09.000 --> 4:08:12.120\n But that's the first thought that came to mind.\n\n4:08:12.120 --> 4:08:14.240\n You've written the following.\n\n4:08:14.240 --> 4:08:22.440\n I've had the experience countless times, making love, watching a sunset, listening to music,\n\n4:08:22.440 --> 4:08:29.840\n feeling the breeze, that I would sign up for this whole life and all of its pains just\n\n4:08:29.840 --> 4:08:33.480\n to experience this exact moment.\n\n4:08:33.480 --> 4:08:37.360\n This is a kind of wordless knowing.\n\n4:08:37.360 --> 4:08:42.400\n It's the most important and real truth I know, that experience itself is infinitely\n\n4:08:42.400 --> 4:08:46.640\n meaningful and pain is temporary.\n\n4:08:46.640 --> 4:08:50.200\n And seen clearly, even the suffering is filled with beauty.\n\n4:08:50.200 --> 4:08:57.920\n I've experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life, such an unreasonable\n\n4:08:57.920 --> 4:08:58.920\n fortune.\n\n4:08:58.920 --> 4:09:03.720\n A few words of gratitude from you, beautifully written.\n\n4:09:03.720 --> 4:09:05.360\n Is there some beautiful moments?\n\n4:09:05.360 --> 4:09:11.280\n Now you have experienced countless lives worth of those moments, but is there some things\n\n4:09:11.280 --> 4:09:20.360\n that if you could, in your darker moments, you can go to to relive, to remind yourself\n\n4:09:20.360 --> 4:09:22.840\n that the whole ride is worthwhile?\n\n4:09:22.840 --> 4:09:24.400\n Maybe skip the making love part.\n\n4:09:24.400 --> 4:09:27.880\n We don't want to know about that.\n\n4:09:27.880 --> 4:09:42.800\n I mean, I feel unreasonably fortunate that it is such a humongous list because, I mean,\n\n4:09:42.800 --> 4:09:48.000\n I feel fortunate to have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of\n\n4:09:48.000 --> 4:09:50.080\n seeing things that makes me see things that way.\n\n4:09:50.080 --> 4:09:55.200\n So I can take responsibility for seeing things in that way and not taking for granted really\n\n4:09:55.200 --> 4:09:58.560\n wonderful things, but I can't take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that\n\n4:09:58.560 --> 4:10:03.760\n even gave me that possibility.\n\n4:10:03.760 --> 4:10:10.400\n You know, it's not just with my wife, it's with every person who I really love when we're\n\n4:10:10.400 --> 4:10:14.920\n talking and I look at their face, I, in the context of a conversation, feel overwhelmed\n\n4:10:14.920 --> 4:10:17.960\n by how lucky I am to get to know them.\n\n4:10:17.960 --> 4:10:21.680\n And like there's never been someone like them in all of history and there never will be\n\n4:10:21.680 --> 4:10:24.820\n again and they might be gone tomorrow, I might be gone tomorrow and like I get this moment\n\n4:10:24.820 --> 4:10:25.820\n with them.\n\n4:10:25.820 --> 4:10:30.320\n And when you take in the uniqueness of that fully and the beauty of it, it's overwhelmingly\n\n4:10:30.320 --> 4:10:33.720\n beautiful.\n\n4:10:33.720 --> 4:10:42.240\n And I remember the first time I did a big dose of mushrooms and I was looking at a tree\n\n4:10:42.240 --> 4:10:47.080\n for a long time and I was just crying with overwhelming how beautiful the tree was.\n\n4:10:47.080 --> 4:10:50.000\n And it was a tree outside the front of my house that I'd walked by a million times and\n\n4:10:50.000 --> 4:10:52.280\n never looked at like this.\n\n4:10:52.280 --> 4:10:58.000\n And it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where I was hallucinating like where the tree was\n\n4:10:58.000 --> 4:10:59.000\n purple.\n\n4:10:59.000 --> 4:11:02.320\n Like the tree still looked like, if I had to describe it, it's green and it has leaves,\n\n4:11:02.320 --> 4:11:08.480\n looks like this, but it was way fucking more beautiful, like capturing than it normally\n\n4:11:08.480 --> 4:11:09.480\n was.\n\n4:11:09.480 --> 4:11:12.100\n And I'm like, why is it so beautiful if I would describe it the same way?\n\n4:11:12.100 --> 4:11:15.760\n And I realized I had no thoughts taking me anywhere else.\n\n4:11:15.760 --> 4:11:19.320\n Like what it seemed like the mushrooms were doing was just actually shutting the narrative\n\n4:11:19.320 --> 4:11:22.960\n off that would have me be distracted so I could really see the tree.\n\n4:11:22.960 --> 4:11:25.240\n And then I'm like, fuck, when I get off these mushrooms, I'm going to practice seeing the\n\n4:11:25.240 --> 4:11:29.320\n tree because it's always that beautiful and I just miss it.\n\n4:11:29.320 --> 4:11:33.360\n And so I practice being with it and quieting the rest of the mind and then being like,\n\n4:11:33.360 --> 4:11:34.360\n wow.\n\n4:11:34.360 --> 4:11:39.120\n And if it's not mushrooms, like people have peak experiences where they'll see life and\n\n4:11:39.120 --> 4:11:40.120\n how incredible it is.\n\n4:11:40.120 --> 4:11:41.120\n It's always there.\n\n4:11:41.120 --> 4:11:49.160\n It's funny that I had this exact same experience on quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone\n\n4:11:49.160 --> 4:11:55.280\n and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it, appreciating the undistorted beauty of\n\n4:11:55.280 --> 4:11:56.280\n it.\n\n4:11:56.280 --> 4:12:02.520\n And it's funny to me that here's two humans, very different with very different journeys\n\n4:12:02.520 --> 4:12:09.400\n or at some moment in time, both looking at a tree like idiots for hours and just in awe\n\n4:12:09.400 --> 4:12:10.400\n and happy to be alive.\n\n4:12:10.400 --> 4:12:17.800\n And yeah, even just that moment alone is worth living for, but you did say humans and we\n\n4:12:17.800 --> 4:12:25.760\n have a moment together as two humans and you mentioned shots that I have to ask, what are\n\n4:12:25.760 --> 4:12:27.080\n we looking at?\n\n4:12:27.080 --> 4:12:32.120\n When I went to go get a smoothie before coming here, I got you a keto smoothie that you didn't\n\n4:12:32.120 --> 4:12:35.080\n want because you're not just keto, but fasting.\n\n4:12:35.080 --> 4:12:39.940\n But I saw the thing with you and your dad where you did shots together and this place\n\n4:12:39.940 --> 4:12:45.960\n happened to have shots of ginger, turmeric, cayenne juice of some kind.\n\n4:12:45.960 --> 4:12:52.360\n So I didn't necessarily plan it for being on the show, I just brought it, but we can\n\n4:12:52.360 --> 4:12:53.360\n do it that way.\n\n4:12:53.360 --> 4:12:59.160\n I think we shall toast like heroes, Daniel.\n\n4:12:59.160 --> 4:13:00.160\n It's a huge honor.\n\n4:13:00.160 --> 4:13:01.760\n What do we toast to?\n\n4:13:01.760 --> 4:13:06.960\n We toast to this moment, this unique moment that we get to share together.\n\n4:13:06.960 --> 4:13:11.480\n I'm very grateful to be here in this moment with you and yeah, I'm grateful that you invited\n\n4:13:11.480 --> 4:13:12.480\n me here.\n\n4:13:12.480 --> 4:13:23.000\n We met for the first time and I will never be the same for the good and the bad, I am.\n\n4:13:23.000 --> 4:13:24.360\n That is really interesting.\n\n4:13:24.360 --> 4:13:29.400\n That feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and I were drinking.\n\n4:13:29.400 --> 4:13:33.280\n So I feel like a better man already, Daniel, this is one of the best conversations I've\n\n4:13:33.280 --> 4:13:34.280\n ever had.\n\n4:13:34.280 --> 4:13:36.240\n I can't wait to have many more.\n\n4:13:36.240 --> 4:13:37.240\n Likewise.\n\n4:13:37.240 --> 4:13:39.200\n This has been an amazing experience.\n\n4:13:39.200 --> 4:13:40.800\n Thank you for wasting all your time today.\n\n4:13:40.800 --> 4:13:48.720\n I want to say in terms of what you're mentioning about like the, that you work in machine learning\n\n4:13:48.720 --> 4:13:55.160\n and the optimism that wants to look at the issues, but wants to look at how this increased\n\n4:13:55.160 --> 4:14:00.600\n technological power could be applied to solving them and that even thinking about the broadcast\n\n4:14:00.600 --> 4:14:05.640\n of like, can I help people understand the issues better and help organize them?\n\n4:14:05.640 --> 4:14:13.120\n Like fundamentally you're oriented like Wikipedia, what I see, to really try to tend to the information\n\n4:14:13.120 --> 4:14:18.040\n commons without another agentic interest distorting it.\n\n4:14:18.040 --> 4:14:24.520\n And for you to be able to get guys like Lee Smolin and Roger Penrose and like the greatest\n\n4:14:24.520 --> 4:14:29.880\n thinkers of, that are alive and have them on the show and most people would never be\n\n4:14:29.880 --> 4:14:34.520\n exposed to them and talk about it in a way that people can understand, I think it's an\n\n4:14:34.520 --> 4:14:35.680\n incredible service.\n\n4:14:35.680 --> 4:14:37.000\n I think you're doing great work.\n\n4:14:37.000 --> 4:14:39.480\n So I was really happy to hear from you.\n\n4:14:39.480 --> 4:14:41.400\n Thank you, Daniel.\n\n4:14:41.400 --> 4:14:44.520\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Daniel Schmachtenberger and thank you\n\n4:14:44.520 --> 4:14:51.760\n to Ground News, NetSuite, Four Sigmatic, Magic Spoon, and BetterHelp.\n\n4:14:51.760 --> 4:14:55.640\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n4:14:55.640 --> 4:14:59.640\n And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.\n\n4:14:59.640 --> 4:15:05.600\n I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought\n\n4:15:05.600 --> 4:15:08.200\n with sticks and stones.\n\n4:15:08.200 --> 4:15:30.320\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
