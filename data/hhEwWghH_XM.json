  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.860\n The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall,\n\n00:02.860 --> 00:05.460\n one of the most insightful minds and systems thinkers\n\n00:05.460 --> 00:07.000\n in the martial arts world.\n\n00:07.000 --> 00:10.000\n He's a black belt in jiu jitsu, accomplished competitor,\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:13.120\n an MMA fighter undefeated in the UFC,\n\n00:13.120 --> 00:16.880\n and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand\n\n00:16.880 --> 00:19.760\n the underlying principles of the martial arts.\n\n00:19.760 --> 00:22.280\n Jiu jitsu is such an important part of who I am,\n\n00:22.280 --> 00:23.880\n and I was hoping to share that with folks\n\n00:23.880 --> 00:26.640\n who might know me only as a researcher.\n\n00:26.640 --> 00:29.960\n I think there's no better person to do that with than Ryan,\n\n00:29.960 --> 00:33.920\n who somehow, remarkably, I can say is a friend,\n\n00:33.920 --> 00:37.000\n and also a modern day warrior philosopher\n\n00:37.000 --> 00:40.320\n of the Miyamoto Masashi line of especially dangerous\n\n00:40.320 --> 00:41.600\n and brilliant humans.\n\n00:42.480 --> 00:46.400\n Also, his amazing wife, Jen Hall, was there as well,\n\n00:46.400 --> 00:50.520\n so if you hear a kind of voice of wisdom coming from above,\n\n00:50.520 --> 00:51.720\n you know who it is.\n\n00:51.720 --> 00:53.320\n Quick summary of the sponsors,\n\n00:53.320 --> 00:56.080\n PowerDot, Babbel, and Cash App.\n\n00:56.080 --> 00:58.040\n Please check out the sponsors in the description\n\n00:58.040 --> 01:01.920\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:01.920 --> 01:05.480\n As a side note, let me say that renaming this podcast\n\n01:05.480 --> 01:09.280\n to just my name gave me intellectual freedom\n\n01:09.280 --> 01:12.100\n that I really didn't anticipate was so empowering,\n\n01:12.100 --> 01:15.220\n especially for someone who's trying to find their voice.\n\n01:15.220 --> 01:18.040\n I hope you'll allow me the chance to really try and do that,\n\n01:18.040 --> 01:21.520\n to step outside of AI and even science, engineering,\n\n01:21.520 --> 01:24.640\n history, and so on, and on occasion,\n\n01:24.640 --> 01:28.080\n talk to athletes, musicians, writers,\n\n01:28.080 --> 01:31.680\n and maybe even comedians who inspire me,\n\n01:31.680 --> 01:34.360\n especially up and coming comedians and musicians\n\n01:34.360 --> 01:36.560\n like Eric Weinstein, who yes,\n\n01:36.560 --> 01:39.240\n we'll do a third conversation with soon.\n\n01:39.240 --> 01:41.440\n I think if I allow myself to expand the range\n\n01:41.440 --> 01:43.560\n of these conversations on occasion,\n\n01:43.560 --> 01:45.400\n when I do return to science and engineering,\n\n01:45.400 --> 01:49.680\n I'll bring a new perspective and also a little bit more fun\n\n01:49.680 --> 01:51.960\n and a few extra listeners\n\n01:51.960 --> 01:55.720\n that may not otherwise realize how fascinating\n\n01:55.720 --> 01:58.040\n artificial intelligence, robotics, mathematics,\n\n01:58.040 --> 02:00.840\n and engineering truly is.\n\n02:00.840 --> 02:03.440\n All that said, please skip the episodes\n\n02:03.440 --> 02:04.480\n that don't interest you.\n\n02:04.480 --> 02:06.800\n You don't have to listen to all of them.\n\n02:06.800 --> 02:11.120\n Trust me, as someone who is a bit or a lot OCD,\n\n02:11.120 --> 02:13.120\n that idea is quite unpleasant.\n\n02:13.120 --> 02:17.600\n But life, friends, is full of unpleasant things.\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:19.480\n But as Hunter S. Thompson suggested,\n\n02:19.480 --> 02:20.980\n and I suggest as well,\n\n02:20.980 --> 02:24.440\n you should still buy the ticket and take the ride.\n\n02:24.440 --> 02:26.360\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:26.360 --> 02:28.400\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n02:28.400 --> 02:30.820\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,\n\n02:30.820 --> 02:34.600\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n02:34.600 --> 02:36.680\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now\n\n02:36.680 --> 02:38.040\n and no ads in the middle.\n\n02:38.040 --> 02:39.780\n I try to make these interesting,\n\n02:39.780 --> 02:41.020\n but I give you the timestamp,\n\n02:41.020 --> 02:43.840\n so please skip if you don't want to listen to the ads,\n\n02:43.840 --> 02:45.800\n but it does mean a lot to me when you do.\n\n02:45.800 --> 02:47.520\n And still please do check out the sponsors\n\n02:47.520 --> 02:49.580\n by clicking on the links in the description.\n\n02:49.580 --> 02:52.720\n It really is the best way to support this podcast.\n\n02:52.720 --> 02:55.040\n This show is sponsored by Power Dot.\n\n02:55.040 --> 02:57.160\n Get it at PowerDot.com slash Lex\n\n02:57.160 --> 03:01.400\n and use code Lex at checkout to get 20% off.\n\n03:01.400 --> 03:04.060\n I use it for muscle recovery for legs and shoulders,\n\n03:04.060 --> 03:06.720\n but you can also use it to build muscle,\n\n03:06.720 --> 03:09.200\n endurance, or even just warm up.\n\n03:09.200 --> 03:11.440\n In fact, I first heard about this kind of\n\n03:11.440 --> 03:13.760\n electrical muscle stimulation device\n\n03:13.760 --> 03:15.960\n in reading that Bruce Lee used it.\n\n03:15.960 --> 03:18.080\n He was an inspiration to me\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:21.680\n as someone who practices first principles thinking,\n\n03:21.680 --> 03:22.720\n especially in a discipline\n\n03:22.720 --> 03:25.120\n where conventional thinking is everywhere.\n\n03:25.120 --> 03:27.240\n He created a martial art called Jeet Kune Do\n\n03:27.240 --> 03:30.100\n that is in many ways, at least philosophically\n\n03:30.100 --> 03:31.400\n in its hybrid approach,\n\n03:31.400 --> 03:34.360\n a precursor to modern day mixed martial arts.\n\n03:34.360 --> 03:36.840\n There's a special kind of deep philosophical thinking\n\n03:36.840 --> 03:40.060\n that combat athletes or jiu jitsu practitioners do\n\n03:40.060 --> 03:42.440\n that is unlike any other.\n\n03:42.440 --> 03:45.440\n I think it's grounded in the humbling process\n\n03:45.440 --> 03:47.920\n of getting your ass kicked a lot.\n\n03:47.920 --> 03:51.060\n That removes any illusion of intellectual superiority.\n\n03:51.060 --> 03:53.200\n I think the journey towards wisdom starts\n\n03:53.200 --> 03:55.400\n when you humbly admit to yourself\n\n03:55.400 --> 03:58.880\n that you know very little or almost nothing.\n\n03:58.880 --> 04:01.300\n Anyway, go to PowerDot.com slash Lex\n\n04:01.300 --> 04:04.520\n and use code Lex at checkout to get 20% off\n\n04:04.520 --> 04:07.260\n on top of the 30 day free trial.\n\n04:07.260 --> 04:09.640\n This show is also sponsored by Babbel,\n\n04:09.640 --> 04:11.840\n an app and website that gets you speaking\n\n04:11.840 --> 04:13.960\n in a new language within weeks.\n\n04:13.960 --> 04:17.920\n

Russian.\n\n04:24.180 --> 04:26.460\n Let me read a few lines from a Russian song\n\n04:26.460 --> 04:28.440\n by Vladimir Vysotsky called\n\n04:28.440 --> 04:30.140\n Anna Bula V Parishe.\n\n04:30.140 --> 04:33.280\n You'll start to understand if you sign up to Babbel.\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:46.880\n The song always made me smile,\n\n04:46.880 --> 04:48.960\n because it resonates with my own life.\n\n04:48.960 --> 04:52.480\n It translates loosely to she's been to Paris.\n\n04:52.480 --> 04:55.920\n Paris for a Russian, I suppose, symbolizing a fancy life\n\n04:55.920 --> 04:58.880\n and that the guy can never quite fit into that kind of life.\n\n04:58.880 --> 05:02.040\n Expensive things, nice restaurants, cars, all that.\n\n05:02.040 --> 05:04.840\n I was thinking about what song's equivalent in English,\n\n05:04.840 --> 05:08.760\n maybe Uptown Girl by Billy Joe is similar in spirit,\n\n05:08.760 --> 05:10.260\n but very different in style.\n\n05:10.260 --> 05:13.700\n I just watched the video on YouTube for Uptown Girl\n\n05:13.700 --> 05:18.080\n and it's basically Billy Joe dressed up as a mechanic,\n\n05:18.080 --> 05:20.220\n but dancing in a way that I'm pretty sure\n\n05:20.220 --> 05:22.520\n no mechanic has ever danced,\n\n05:22.520 --> 05:25.280\n turning the old cringe factor up to 11.\n\n05:25.280 --> 05:27.680\n Anyway, I always felt like I didn't really fit in\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:30.880\n with the fancy people and that's what this song represents.\n\n05:30.880 --> 05:32.400\n But back to Babbel.\n\n05:32.400 --> 05:34.560\n Get started by visiting babbel.com\n\n05:34.560 --> 05:37.440\n and use code LEX to get three months free.\n\n05:37.440 --> 05:39.980\n This show is presented by the great, the powerful,\n\n05:39.980 --> 05:42.000\n the OG sponsor named unofficially\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.920\n after one of my favorite musicians,\n\n05:43.920 --> 05:46.240\n the man in black, Johnny Cash.\n\n05:46.240 --> 05:48.600\n That's Cash App, the number one finance app\n\n05:48.600 --> 05:49.600\n in the App Store.\n\n05:49.600 --> 05:52.320\n When you get it, use code LEX podcast.\n\n05:52.320 --> 05:55.240\n The Cash App folks are truly amazing people\n\n05:55.240 --> 05:58.000\n and are teaming with ideas for cool contests,\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:00.480\n giveaways and all that kind of stuff.\n\n06:00.480 --> 06:03.080\n I've been thinking of doing some kind of a little contest\n\n06:03.080 --> 06:07.720\n and giving away 42 bucks to a bunch of people who win.\n\n06:07.720 --> 06:08.980\n It's not so much about the money,\n\n06:08.980 --> 06:13.500\n but the glory and a delicious taste of victory.\n\n06:13.500 --> 06:15.960\n If you have ideas for a contest, let me know.\n\n06:15.960 --> 06:17.880\n I was thinking of something like asking people\n\n06:17.880 --> 06:21.280\n to submit funny, inspiring photos or videos or audio\n\n06:21.280 --> 06:25.040\n of using Cash App or any of the sponsors of this podcast,\n\n06:25.040 --> 06:27.860\n really, or maybe even just funny things related\n\n06:27.860 --> 06:30.640\n to the podcast, like different weird places\n\n06:30.640 --> 06:34.120\n you might be watching or listening to me right now.\n\n06:34.120 --> 06:37.020\n I'm pretty sure there's somebody out there right now\n\n06:37.020 --> 06:41.120\n sitting in a hot tub with some wine watching me say this.\n\n06:41.120 --> 06:43.240\n I salute you, sir or madam.\n\n06:44.120 --> 06:47.800\n I may be opening up some floodgates I deeply regret later,\n\n06:47.800 --> 06:50.040\n so please make sure you're wearing clothes\n\n06:50.040 --> 06:51.360\n and whatever you sent me.\n\n06:51.360 --> 06:54.300\n There'll be no naked people in the hot tub\n\n06:54.300 --> 06:56.180\n as part of this podcast.\n\n06:56.180 --> 06:58.820\n I have integrity and standards.\n\n06:59.880 --> 07:01.280\n Let me know in the comments what ideas\n\n07:01.280 --> 07:02.600\n for contests you might have.\n\n07:02.600 --> 07:05.440\n Again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n07:05.440 --> 07:08.520\n and use the code LexPodcast, you get $10,\n\n07:08.520 --> 07:11.440\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n07:11.440 --> 07:14.360\n an organization that is helping to advance robotics\n\n07:14.360 --> 07:17.880\n and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n07:17.880 --> 07:21.500\n And now, here's my conversation with Ryan Hall.\n\n07:22.440 --> 07:25.600\n Who, in your view, is the greatest warrior in history?\n\n07:25.600 --> 07:27.120\n Ancient or modern?\n\n07:27.120 --> 07:28.880\n That's a tough question, and again,\n\n07:28.880 --> 07:31.480\n I'm no historian by any measure,\n\n07:31.480 --> 07:32.920\n so I'll probably do the worst.\n\n07:32.920 --> 07:34.120\n It's like, what are your best bands ever?\n\n07:34.120 --> 07:37.680\n I'm like, Metallica, and you know, so I'll pick the...\n\n07:37.680 --> 07:39.160\n Metallica just came out with a new album,\n\n07:39.160 --> 07:41.720\n by the way, with an entire orchestra.\n\n07:41.720 --> 07:42.560\n That's kind of cool.\n\n07:42.560 --> 07:43.380\n Yeah. That's important.\n\n07:43.380 --> 07:45.400\n Metallica will always be one of the greatest.\n\n07:45.400 --> 07:46.240\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n07:46.240 --> 07:47.080\n So I agree with you.\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:47.900\n They were a bad example.\n\n07:47.900 --> 07:49.000\n They were a well known, yet awesome band.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.960\n Let me say it's like Nickelback or something like that.\n\n07:50.960 --> 07:52.160\n I mean, that feels cheap\n\n07:52.160 --> 07:53.320\n because everyone makes fun of Nickelback.\n\n07:53.320 --> 07:54.160\n Yeah.\n\n07:54.160 --> 07:56.800\n I guess it depends on how you want to define warrior.\n\n07:56.800 --> 07:58.120\n Something that I think about\n\n07:58.120 --> 08:00.440\n when it comes to trying to evaluate\n\n08:00.440 --> 08:02.480\n various people or situations\n\n08:02.480 --> 08:04.280\n or things that I've read about or heard about\n\n08:04.280 --> 08:07.840\n are the circumstances that they were involved in\n\n08:07.840 --> 08:09.440\n because I think a lot of times\n\n08:09.440 --> 08:11.040\n it's easy to look at the outcomes,\n\n08:11.040 --> 08:13.040\n and obviously we live in an outcome driven world\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:14.600\n and outcomes do matter,\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:18.680\n but at the same time, you look at,\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:20.740\n let's say what Cuba's been able to pull off\n\n08:20.740 --> 08:23.720\n from a combat sports perspective, it's staggering.\n\n08:23.720 --> 08:26.760\n The amount of successful Olympic level competitors\n\n08:26.760 --> 08:28.720\n they have in wrestling, boxing, judo.\n\n08:29.920 --> 08:31.200\n I mean, they're a tiny little island\n\n08:31.200 --> 08:32.680\n with no money and no people.\n\n08:32.680 --> 08:33.760\n That's shocking.\n\n08:33.760 --> 08:35.760\n You know, when you think about the Olympics\n\n08:35.760 --> 08:36.800\n and the United States doing well,\n\n08:36.800 --> 08:37.800\n of course we should do well.\n\n08:37.800 --> 08:39.060\n I mean, Russia should do well.\n\n08:39.060 --> 08:40.560\n China should do well.\n\n08:40.560 --> 08:42.800\n India should do better than they do, honestly.\n\n08:42.800 --> 08:44.520\n Obviously it means like they're not into it as much\n\n08:44.520 --> 08:45.760\n or at least certain sports\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:48.000\n because they have the resources people wise.\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:49.940\n So talent's not going to be an issue.\n\n08:49.940 --> 08:51.240\n So there's something to like\n\n08:51.240 --> 08:53.960\n where the starting point is.\n\n08:53.960 --> 08:56.000\n Like that's the argument with like,\n\n08:56.000 --> 08:57.760\n why people say Maradona,\n\n08:57.760 --> 09:00.700\n I don't know if you're into soccer, okay.\n\n09:00.700 --> 09:03.140\n They say Maradona is better than Messi\n\n09:03.140 --> 09:05.320\n because he basically carried the team\n\n09:05.320 --> 09:07.100\n and won the World Cup with a team\n\n09:07.100 --> 09:09.040\n that wouldn't otherwise win the World Cup.\n\n09:09.040 --> 09:12.960\n And then Messi was only successful in Barcelona\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:15.680\n because he has like superstars,\n\n09:15.680 --> 09:17.360\n he's playing with other superstars.\n\n09:17.360 --> 09:18.180\n Right.\n\n09:18.180 --> 09:19.320\n Yeah, that's fair to say.\n\n09:19.320 --> 09:20.360\n I mean, like you're not,\n\n09:20.360 --> 09:21.680\n there's a lot of factors that go into,\n\n09:21.680 --> 09:23.320\n let's say winning a soccer game.\n\n09:23.320 --> 09:24.960\n And obviously Barcelona,\n\n09:24.960 --> 09:26.400\n particularly for various points in time\n\n09:26.400 --> 09:29.680\n had a ridiculous all star squad of world class players.\n\n09:29.680 --> 09:32.040\n But let's say for instance,\n\n09:32.040 --> 09:34.140\n maybe they didn't have the creative players in Argentina.\n\n09:34.140 --> 09:36.160\n They needed to get the ball up to Messi.\n\n09:36.160 --> 09:37.960\n They didn't have like the NES\n\n09:37.960 --> 09:41.200\n and again the backing there in the midfield.\n\n09:41.200 --> 09:44.000\n But because obviously Argentina's always had\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:45.280\n ridiculous attacking players,\n\n09:45.280 --> 09:46.320\n like even alongside Messi,\n\n09:46.320 --> 09:48.120\n but they're like the three killers up front\n\n09:48.120 --> 09:50.680\n and then a little less behind.\n\n09:50.680 --> 09:52.960\n So it's interesting you say that\n\n09:52.960 --> 09:54.200\n depends how you define warrior\n\n09:54.200 --> 09:55.960\n because you can probably take like\n\n09:55.960 --> 09:57.760\n some of the civil rights leaders,\n\n09:57.760 --> 09:59.160\n you can go into that direction,\n\n09:59.160 --> 10:00.440\n like leaders in general.\n\n10:00.440 --> 10:01.720\n But if we just look at like\n\n10:01.720 --> 10:04.840\n the greatest martial artists in history in that direction,\n\n10:04.840 --> 10:05.720\n do you have somebody in mind?\n\n10:05.720 --> 10:08.360\n I would say at least three that pop into my head\n\n10:08.360 --> 10:12.960\n and would be Hannibal, Alexander the Great,\n\n10:12.960 --> 10:14.960\n and then maybe Miyamoto Musashi,\n\n10:14.960 --> 10:18.560\n the two commanders and then one guy.\n\n10:18.560 --> 10:21.280\n But so it's interesting.\n\n10:21.280 --> 10:22.760\n And then again, you mentioned warriors\n\n10:22.760 --> 10:25.400\n being able to make a lot out of a little.\n\n10:25.400 --> 10:27.960\n Musashi's famous for winning duels\n\n10:27.960 --> 10:31.120\n that were oftentimes one on one.\n\n10:31.120 --> 10:35.080\n The Alexander and Hannibal were military commanders\n\n10:35.080 --> 10:36.760\n and one of them faced Rome.\n\n10:36.760 --> 10:38.280\n And that was an interesting thing.\n\n10:38.280 --> 10:40.600\n Oftentimes coming up with novel tactics,\n\n10:40.600 --> 10:43.960\n different strategies, sometimes under resourced,\n\n10:43.960 --> 10:45.520\n having to do novel and crazy things,\n\n10:45.520 --> 10:46.760\n there's skin in the game.\n\n10:46.760 --> 10:47.840\n That's an interesting thing too.\n\n10:47.840 --> 10:49.840\n I think a lot of times it's,\n\n10:49.840 --> 10:50.800\n if you're playing a video game,\n\n10:50.800 --> 10:51.920\n I don't think you can be a warrior\n\n10:51.920 --> 10:53.760\n because there's no skin in the game.\n\n10:53.760 --> 10:56.000\n You get hurt, you lose, that's a bummer.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:56.840\n It stings a little bit,\n\n10:56.840 --> 10:58.800\n maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed,\n\n10:58.800 --> 11:02.800\n but Musashi loses, he loses.\n\n11:02.800 --> 11:04.160\n Hannibal loses, he loses.\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:05.360\n Alexander loses, he loses.\n\n11:05.360 --> 11:08.080\n And they lose, I guess the people around them lose.\n\n11:08.080 --> 11:10.720\n So that's almost like you could use,\n\n11:10.720 --> 11:13.280\n even from a combat sports perspective, Muhammad Ali,\n\n11:13.280 --> 11:15.800\n I mean, you consider also their quality of opposition.\n\n11:15.800 --> 11:17.920\n Musashi was fighting high quality opposition.\n\n11:17.920 --> 11:20.320\n Obviously Hannibal and Alexander, particularly Hannibal,\n\n11:20.320 --> 11:22.280\n were fighting unbelievable opposition.\n\n11:22.280 --> 11:25.200\n Muhammad Ali fought phenomenal opposition,\n\n11:25.200 --> 11:27.240\n but he had skin in the game both in the ring and out.\n\n11:27.240 --> 11:29.320\n And that actually meshes with, as you mentioned,\n\n11:29.320 --> 11:31.320\n like a civil rights type of situation\n\n11:31.320 --> 11:32.960\n where you are under resourced,\n\n11:32.960 --> 11:35.000\n you're pushing the stone uphill.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:37.600\n And that was a neat thing I think about Muhammad Ali\n\n11:37.600 --> 11:41.040\n was how much personal conviction the man had to have\n\n11:41.040 --> 11:42.560\n in order to pull off what he was able to pull off\n\n11:42.560 --> 11:44.640\n both in and outside of the ring.\n\n11:44.640 --> 11:46.680\n And that reminds me of, again,\n\n11:46.680 --> 11:47.600\n some of the other great leaders\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:48.880\n or great fighters throughout history.\n\n11:48.880 --> 11:53.400\n So what do you make of the kind of very difficult idea\n\n11:53.400 --> 11:56.640\n that some of these conquerors like Alexander the Great\n\n11:56.640 --> 12:00.920\n and somebody that, if you listen to Hardcore History,\n\n12:00.920 --> 12:04.000\n oh, Dan Carlin, who apparently Elon Musk\n\n12:04.000 --> 12:07.420\n is also a big fan of, is the Genghis Khan episode.\n\n12:07.420 --> 12:12.420\n A large percent of the world can call Genghis Khan\n\n12:18.580 --> 12:20.140\n an ancestor.\n\n12:20.140 --> 12:24.220\n So the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors\n\n12:24.220 --> 12:28.900\n is that there's a lot of murder and rape and pillage\n\n12:28.900 --> 12:32.220\n and stealing of resources and all that kind of stuff.\n\n12:32.220 --> 12:37.100\n And yet they're often remembered as quite honorable.\n\n12:37.100 --> 12:38.580\n I mean, in the case of Genghis Khan,\n\n12:38.580 --> 12:39.980\n there's a lot of people who argue,\n\n12:39.980 --> 12:43.100\n if you look at historically the way it's described\n\n12:44.100 --> 12:47.340\n in full context, is he was ultimately,\n\n12:49.220 --> 12:52.300\n given the time, he was a liberator.\n\n12:52.300 --> 12:56.020\n He was a progressive, I should say.\n\n12:57.260 --> 13:02.260\n In terms of the violence and the atrocities he committed,\n\n13:02.260 --> 13:06.620\n he, at least in the stories, has always provided the option\n\n13:06.620 --> 13:07.820\n of not to do that.\n\n13:07.820 --> 13:10.340\n It's only if you resist, do,\n\n13:10.340 --> 13:11.380\n so you basically have the option,\n\n13:11.380 --> 13:14.660\n do you wanna join us or do you want to die?\n\n13:14.660 --> 13:16.140\n And die horribly.\n\n13:17.940 --> 13:19.820\n That's the progressive sort of,\n\n13:19.820 --> 13:21.540\n that's the Bernie Sanders of the era.\n\n13:21.540 --> 13:22.500\n Nice.\n\n13:22.500 --> 13:24.260\n So what do you make of that?\n\n13:24.260 --> 13:27.620\n That there's so much of these great conquerors,\n\n13:27.620 --> 13:32.620\n there's so much murder that to us now would just seem insane.\n\n13:33.300 --> 13:34.580\n It's funny you mention it.\n\n13:34.580 --> 13:37.220\n I think that maybe it's a human nature thing\n\n13:37.220 --> 13:40.980\n that we want to, or maybe a misunderstanding thing\n\n13:40.980 --> 13:44.260\n that we want to cast all of our characters and ourselves\n\n13:44.260 --> 13:47.540\n maybe as entirely good or as entirely negative\n\n13:47.540 --> 13:50.700\n when I guess the phrase or the saying,\n\n13:50.700 --> 13:54.140\n one man's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist,\n\n13:54.140 --> 13:55.420\n is accurate.\n\n13:55.420 --> 13:57.700\n And a lot of times I think you can understand\n\n13:57.700 --> 13:59.460\n as long as you're able to look\n\n13:59.460 --> 14:00.780\n from various people's perspective.\n\n14:00.780 --> 14:03.220\n Like if you look at the TV show, The Wire,\n\n14:03.220 --> 14:06.500\n which was obviously widely, everybody loves The Wire.\n\n14:06.500 --> 14:08.020\n I thought that there were everyone,\n\n14:08.020 --> 14:10.060\n I'm not saying anything that's not been said before,\n\n14:10.060 --> 14:11.420\n compelling characters from all angles,\n\n14:11.420 --> 14:13.660\n whether you like the character, dislike the character,\n\n14:13.660 --> 14:16.140\n you were able to understand the motivations of people\n\n14:16.140 --> 14:17.300\n doing various things.\n\n14:17.300 --> 14:20.180\n Even if they did wrongly, they did rightly.\n\n14:20.180 --> 14:23.740\n We want to cast all of the demons throughout history\n\n14:23.740 --> 14:27.060\n as completely inhuman when I think that makes it difficult\n\n14:27.060 --> 14:27.980\n for us to understand them.\n\n14:27.980 --> 14:30.580\n And we want to look back at the people\n\n14:30.580 --> 14:33.940\n that we think of as great and entirely great.\n\n14:33.940 --> 14:37.220\n And I think that we're experiencing the problems with this\n\n14:37.220 --> 14:38.820\n even right now, socially and politically\n\n14:38.820 --> 14:40.180\n as we're trying to look back and decide\n\n14:40.180 --> 14:41.620\n the people we thought were good or not good\n\n14:41.620 --> 14:43.420\n or people we thought were bad are now good\n\n14:43.420 --> 14:46.580\n rather than going, hey, there's good and bad to all things.\n\n14:46.580 --> 14:49.780\n And there are, as you mentioned, the Genghis Khan thing,\n\n14:49.780 --> 14:51.180\n you don't have to fight back.\n\n14:52.220 --> 14:53.580\n You do, I respect you for it,\n\n14:53.580 --> 14:54.900\n but then we're gonna have a conflict\n\n14:54.900 --> 14:56.300\n and then we'll see what happens.\n\n14:56.300 --> 14:58.020\n And if you lose, you're gonna be sorry that you did\n\n14:58.020 --> 14:59.780\n because I have to make it that way.\n\n14:59.780 --> 15:02.540\n If I want to continue utilizing this kind of MO\n\n15:02.540 --> 15:05.300\n because I need to discourage the next guy\n\n15:05.300 --> 15:07.300\n from doing what you're doing right now.\n\n15:07.300 --> 15:10.220\n And ultimately though, I guess that's an interesting thing.\n\n15:10.220 --> 15:11.860\n Imagine you put every single person\n\n15:11.860 --> 15:16.660\n on planet earth in a cage, crime drops, all sorts.\n\n15:16.660 --> 15:18.580\n There are certain positives to that.\n\n15:18.580 --> 15:23.140\n And it's just, things are as they are, it's difficult,\n\n15:23.140 --> 15:25.140\n but that is ultimately more the law of the jungle.\n\n15:25.140 --> 15:27.900\n And I think that we're able to supersede some of that now\n\n15:27.900 --> 15:30.180\n in modern times and I think we're fortunate.\n\n15:30.180 --> 15:32.180\n But as you mentioned, we look back and say,\n\n15:32.180 --> 15:33.500\n oh, this is horrible.\n\n15:33.500 --> 15:35.620\n Say, no, that just is what it is.\n\n15:35.620 --> 15:37.980\n That's how life is at a base level.\n\n15:37.980 --> 15:40.420\n And again, if you're a lion and I'm a gazelle,\n\n15:40.420 --> 15:42.380\n I don't really like it very much,\n\n15:42.380 --> 15:44.860\n but we don't call the lion the bad guy.\n\n15:44.860 --> 15:47.780\n We don't sanctify the gazelle or the other way around.\n\n15:47.780 --> 15:50.100\n So it's just, it's interesting when you pull back\n\n15:50.100 --> 15:53.020\n some of the controls that we put on our behavior\n\n15:53.020 --> 15:54.500\n and in modern life,\n\n15:54.500 --> 15:56.940\n which I think are generally speaking positive,\n\n15:56.940 --> 15:59.140\n we get down to how things often are.\n\n15:59.140 --> 16:02.860\n And at the same time, we could,\n\n16:02.860 --> 16:06.460\n modern life was built by people like Genghis Khan.\n\n16:06.460 --> 16:09.540\n So then you get down to the ends justifying the means.\n\n16:09.540 --> 16:10.380\n It's a tough question.\n\n16:10.380 --> 16:11.740\n These aren't things with easy answers,\n\n16:11.740 --> 16:14.020\n or at least if they are, I certainly don't have the smarts\n\n16:14.020 --> 16:18.060\n to figure out the answers to them, but it's difficult.\n\n16:18.060 --> 16:20.140\n I would just say people in the world are complicated\n\n16:20.140 --> 16:22.140\n and layered and depending upon which side of the line\n\n16:22.140 --> 16:23.940\n you're standing on at various times,\n\n16:23.940 --> 16:26.500\n you may like or dislike someone,\n\n16:26.500 --> 16:30.300\n but I can't remember whose idea it was,\n\n16:30.300 --> 16:31.900\n this is killing me, but it's the veil of ignorance,\n\n16:31.900 --> 16:36.540\n I guess, the philosophical idea of the veil of ignorance\n\n16:36.540 --> 16:39.340\n where I go, is sticking everyone in the cage\n\n16:39.340 --> 16:41.100\n the right thing to do?\n\n16:41.100 --> 16:43.460\n Or everyone but me, and I say, well, no, why?\n\n16:43.460 --> 16:44.740\n Well, it would make my life easier\n\n16:44.740 --> 16:46.140\n if I just went over and took all of your stuff\n\n16:46.140 --> 16:47.780\n as long as you couldn't stop me.\n\n16:47.780 --> 16:48.820\n I mean, of course that's a great idea.\n\n16:48.820 --> 16:50.500\n That's what everyone does in every video game.\n\n16:50.500 --> 16:53.460\n But in Skyrim, you steal stuff when people aren't around.\n\n16:53.460 --> 16:56.140\n But ultimately you go, well,\n\n16:56.140 --> 16:57.220\n this isn't the right thing to do\n\n16:57.220 --> 16:59.020\n because if I were on the other side of it,\n\n16:59.020 --> 17:00.860\n I would not appreciate it.\n\n17:00.860 --> 17:02.660\n It's inherently not a good thing to do.\n\n17:02.660 --> 17:04.820\n I'm only doing it because I think I'm gonna win.\n\n17:04.820 --> 17:06.580\n And that's a fine way to be,\n\n17:06.580 --> 17:08.860\n but you don't have the white hat on, I guess I would say.\n\n17:08.860 --> 17:12.340\n So I think without those philosophical underpinnings\n\n17:12.340 --> 17:15.300\n to rein us in, I guess, morally speaking,\n\n17:15.300 --> 17:17.580\n it's very difficult to say what's right or wrong.\n\n17:17.580 --> 17:20.220\n And you'd say certain actions have a reaction,\n\n17:20.220 --> 17:21.860\n almost like a physics sense.\n\n17:21.860 --> 17:24.140\n If you kill everyone in your way\n\n17:24.140 --> 17:27.780\n for as long as you're able to, your life will be easier.\n\n17:27.780 --> 17:29.700\n I mean, you're setting the table for someone\n\n17:29.700 --> 17:31.580\n doing the same to you when you're no longer the tough guy,\n\n17:31.580 --> 17:32.860\n but it is what it is.\n\n17:32.860 --> 17:35.860\n Yeah, if you look at like the Instagram channel,\n\n17:35.860 --> 17:39.780\n nature is metal, it hurts my heart to watch,\n\n17:39.780 --> 17:44.540\n to remind me, a comfortable descendant of ape,\n\n17:44.540 --> 17:52.460\n how vicious nature is, just unapologetically, just,\n\n17:52.460 --> 17:58.540\n I mean, there's a process to it where the bad guy always wins.\n\n17:58.540 --> 18:04.220\n The violence is the solution to most problems,\n\n18:04.220 --> 18:07.500\n or the flip side of that running away from violence\n\n18:07.500 --> 18:10.140\n is the solution depending on your skillset.\n\n18:10.140 --> 18:12.620\n And it's funny to think of us humans\n\n18:12.620 --> 18:15.020\n with our extra little piece of brain\n\n18:15.020 --> 18:17.180\n that we're somehow trying to figure out,\n\n18:17.180 --> 18:18.700\n like you said, in a philosophical way,\n\n18:18.700 --> 18:23.020\n how to supersede that, how to like move past the viciousness,\n\n18:23.020 --> 18:30.220\n the cruelty, just the cold exchange of nature.\n\n18:30.220 --> 18:33.580\n But perhaps it's not so, maybe that is nature,\n\n18:33.580 --> 18:38.460\n maybe that's the way of life, maybe we're trying too hard to,\n\n18:38.460 --> 18:43.340\n we're being too egotistical and thinking we're somehow\n\n18:43.340 --> 18:45.420\n separate from nature, we're somehow distant\n\n18:45.420 --> 18:46.460\n from that very thing.\n\n18:46.460 --> 18:47.580\n I couldn't agree with you more.\n\n18:47.580 --> 18:49.580\n In fact, I think actually Orson Scott Card,\n\n18:49.580 --> 18:51.740\n who's the writer of a great book called Ender's Game,\n\n18:53.820 --> 18:56.540\n this was a statement that the main character,\n\n18:56.540 --> 18:58.380\n Ender, made in the book.\n\n18:58.380 --> 18:59.740\n His brother was brilliant.\n\n19:00.300 --> 19:04.220\n His brother was like kind of sociopathic brilliant kid\n\n19:04.220 --> 19:05.740\n that ended up kicked out of the school\n\n19:05.740 --> 19:07.980\n that they were all into for Battle Commander.\n\n19:07.980 --> 19:10.700\n Dealing with his brother taught him that ultimately strength,\n\n19:10.700 --> 19:12.860\n courage, the ability to do violence\n\n19:12.860 --> 19:14.300\n for all the good and the bad of that\n\n19:14.300 --> 19:16.860\n is one of the fundamental most important things\n\n19:16.860 --> 19:17.820\n to be able to do in life,\n\n19:17.820 --> 19:19.420\n because if you can't cause destruction,\n\n19:19.420 --> 19:20.780\n if you can't cause pain,\n\n19:20.780 --> 19:23.020\n you will be forever subject to those who can.\n\n19:23.020 --> 19:25.020\n And I think that you mentioned egotism.\n\n19:25.020 --> 19:26.540\n I think that that's a disease\n\n19:26.540 --> 19:28.300\n that could obviously strike any of us,\n\n19:28.300 --> 19:29.660\n but it's something that we're looking at now.\n\n19:29.660 --> 19:33.100\n We're, I think we should be unbelievably thankful\n\n19:33.100 --> 19:35.260\n as people that live in the world that we do\n\n19:35.260 --> 19:36.860\n that we can walk down the street\n\n19:36.860 --> 19:38.620\n without having to worry that I'm like,\n\n19:38.620 --> 19:40.460\n well, don't worry that that's six foot six,\n\n19:40.460 --> 19:43.660\n 270 pound person over there is just gonna leave me alone.\n\n19:43.660 --> 19:45.900\n And I have a Rolex on, but whatever, I'll be fine.\n\n19:45.900 --> 19:47.900\n Because that person is deciding to leave me alone\n\n19:47.900 --> 19:51.740\n because we've all agreed to live in this relatively sane\n\n19:51.740 --> 19:54.780\n and or constrained society because it benefits all of us.\n\n19:54.780 --> 19:57.820\n And we're doing it because of a philosophical underpinning,\n\n19:57.820 --> 19:59.660\n not because nature dictates it be that way,\n\n19:59.660 --> 20:01.340\n because nature dictates it go in a very,\n\n20:01.340 --> 20:02.220\n very different direction.\n\n20:02.220 --> 20:03.100\n And the only person,\n\n20:03.100 --> 20:04.220\n the only thing stopping that person\n\n20:04.220 --> 20:08.300\n from doing something to me is either me, that person,\n\n20:08.300 --> 20:10.540\n or someone else that will stand in between us.\n\n20:10.540 --> 20:11.980\n And if I can't do it,\n\n20:11.980 --> 20:13.660\n and there's no one there to stand in between us,\n\n20:13.660 --> 20:16.460\n then the only thing stopping that person is that person.\n\n20:16.460 --> 20:19.100\n And I have to hope that they're either disinterested\n\n20:19.100 --> 20:21.340\n or disinclined to do that sort of thing.\n\n20:21.340 --> 20:24.700\n And I think that it's keeping in mind\n\n20:24.700 --> 20:27.900\n that that is the fundamental nature of the world,\n\n20:27.900 --> 20:30.540\n whether we like it or not is important.\n\n20:30.540 --> 20:34.860\n And I think the quest to fundamentally alter human nature\n\n20:34.860 --> 20:36.380\n is gonna be ultimately fruitless.\n\n20:36.380 --> 20:38.780\n And then also it's, it is a little bit egotistical.\n\n20:38.780 --> 20:40.620\n A lion does what a lion does.\n\n20:40.620 --> 20:44.300\n We can try to box it in and we can try to guide\n\n20:44.300 --> 20:45.420\n this direction, that direction.\n\n20:45.420 --> 20:49.340\n But nature is as it is and as it always will be\n\n20:49.340 --> 20:52.620\n unless we wanna start to constrain it significantly.\n\n20:52.620 --> 20:55.420\n But now I'm starting to get into individual rights\n\n20:55.420 --> 20:56.460\n who put me in charge,\n\n20:56.460 --> 20:57.580\n who says that I should be the one\n\n20:57.580 --> 20:58.780\n to make the choices constraining\n\n20:58.780 --> 21:00.700\n because many of the most awful things\n\n21:00.700 --> 21:02.300\n that have happened throughout history,\n\n21:02.300 --> 21:05.180\n one group or one person has decided to constrain others.\n\n21:05.740 --> 21:08.060\n And we don't like Genghis Khan doing that.\n\n21:08.060 --> 21:10.140\n Well, I'll do that on a little level.\n\n21:10.140 --> 21:12.620\n Are there gonna be benefits and beneficiaries?\n\n21:12.620 --> 21:15.100\n Absolutely, but there'll be losers in that too.\n\n21:15.100 --> 21:16.460\n So I guess it's a dangerous game.\n\n21:16.460 --> 21:17.980\n It's almost like putting on the one ring.\n\n21:17.980 --> 21:20.860\n You remember when Frodo offered the one ring to Gandalf\n\n21:20.860 --> 21:23.180\n and Gandalf said, no, no, I would take it away.\n\n21:23.180 --> 21:24.300\n I would put it on.\n\n21:24.300 --> 21:26.300\n I would use it out of the desire to do good.\n\n21:26.300 --> 21:28.940\n But through me, it would wield a power so terrible\n\n21:28.940 --> 21:29.980\n you can't imagine.\n\n21:29.980 --> 21:33.180\n I think that's the big question for anyone that decides\n\n21:33.180 --> 21:36.300\n that's able to have reach and able to have power.\n\n21:36.300 --> 21:38.380\n I mean, obviously I can't speak to that,\n\n21:38.380 --> 21:41.020\n but imagine you did have national level,\n\n21:41.020 --> 21:42.460\n global level power.\n\n21:42.460 --> 21:43.420\n How would you use it?\n\n21:43.420 --> 21:44.860\n Would you try to change the world?\n\n21:45.660 --> 21:47.500\n Would you be glad that you did down the line?\n\n21:47.500 --> 21:48.000\n I don't know.\n\n21:48.860 --> 21:52.060\n Yeah, that's the thing we're struggling now as a society.\n\n21:52.060 --> 21:54.700\n Maybe it'd be nice to get your quick comment on that,\n\n21:54.700 --> 21:58.620\n which is the people who have traditionally been powerless\n\n21:59.580 --> 22:05.500\n are now seeking a fairer society, a more equal society.\n\n22:05.500 --> 22:11.500\n And in attaining more power justly,\n\n22:12.460 --> 22:16.140\n there's also a realization, at least from my perspective,\n\n22:16.140 --> 22:18.300\n that power corrupts everyone.\n\n22:18.300 --> 22:26.940\n Even if the flag you wave is that of justice, right?\n\n22:26.940 --> 22:31.580\n And so, not to overuse the term, but it'd be nice\n\n22:31.580 --> 22:34.620\n if you have thoughts about the whole idea of cancel culture\n\n22:34.620 --> 22:39.580\n and the internet and Twitter and so on,\n\n22:39.580 --> 22:45.340\n where there's nuanced, difficult discussions of race,\n\n22:45.340 --> 22:51.580\n of gender, of fairness, equality, justice,\n\n22:51.580 --> 22:52.700\n all of these kinds of things.\n\n22:53.260 --> 22:57.740\n There's a shouting down oftentimes of nuanced discussion\n\n22:57.740 --> 23:04.860\n of kind of trying to reason through these very difficult issues,\n\n23:04.860 --> 23:07.420\n through our history, through what our future looks like.\n\n23:07.420 --> 23:10.220\n Do you have thoughts about the internet discourse\n\n23:10.220 --> 23:11.420\n that's going on now?\n\n23:11.420 --> 23:12.620\n Is there something positive?\n\n23:12.620 --> 23:16.780\n Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting thing to see.\n\n23:16.780 --> 23:17.980\n I guess, as you mentioned,\n\n23:19.500 --> 23:22.860\n anytime you're wielding power, whomever you are,\n\n23:22.860 --> 23:24.860\n doing so carefully is important.\n\n23:24.860 --> 23:28.380\n And it's very, very easy to look at the people that have power\n\n23:28.380 --> 23:31.340\n and that are using it poorly or have used it poorly\n\n23:31.340 --> 23:32.460\n and go, hey, you're the bad guy.\n\n23:33.260 --> 23:35.420\n And then go, well, of course, if I had power,\n\n23:35.420 --> 23:38.140\n I'll use it properly and I may intend to use it properly\n\n23:38.140 --> 23:38.860\n and maybe I will.\n\n23:38.860 --> 23:43.020\n But at the same time, we see a lot of times\n\n23:43.580 --> 23:44.860\n people are people are people.\n\n23:44.860 --> 23:48.460\n I think that a lot of the...\n\n23:48.460 --> 23:52.300\n I think if you believe that human beings are all one,\n\n23:52.300 --> 23:54.540\n which I do, no matter whether you're here or there,\n\n23:54.540 --> 23:57.820\n you got two arms, two legs, a heart, a brain,\n\n23:57.820 --> 24:00.300\n we all live a similar experience.\n\n24:00.300 --> 24:02.620\n And obviously, with variations on a theme,\n\n24:02.620 --> 24:05.660\n but you're no less a human being.\n\n24:05.660 --> 24:07.740\n If you're a person I've never met from China,\n\n24:07.740 --> 24:12.140\n than some person in Virginia, we're all people.\n\n24:12.140 --> 24:14.860\n And I guess, ultimately, if I believe that human beings\n\n24:14.860 --> 24:16.380\n are corruptible and that power corrupts\n\n24:16.380 --> 24:19.820\n and that we're all fallible and we say and do things\n\n24:19.820 --> 24:22.060\n that either intentionally or unintentionally\n\n24:22.860 --> 24:28.140\n that we wish we'd not, I think that I have to allow\n\n24:28.140 --> 24:31.740\n for a space, I guess the word, it's almost a religious term,\n\n24:31.740 --> 24:33.100\n but I guess I would just say grace.\n\n24:33.100 --> 24:36.540\n And that's something that I see disappearing from discourse\n\n24:36.540 --> 24:39.100\n in the public, or maybe it wasn't there, I'm not sure,\n\n24:39.100 --> 24:42.060\n but it's interesting watching this occur on the internet\n\n24:42.060 --> 24:45.740\n because also now no longer are you and I just having a talk\n\n24:45.740 --> 24:48.460\n sitting on a bus stop, it's now in writing.\n\n24:48.460 --> 24:49.180\n Everything's in writing.\n\n24:49.180 --> 24:51.340\n The old saying, don't put that in writing.\n\n24:51.340 --> 24:52.540\n You're like, don't put anything in writing.\n\n24:52.540 --> 24:53.580\n That's how you get in trouble.\n\n24:53.580 --> 24:57.180\n And basically, with the degree to which everything\n\n24:57.180 --> 24:59.340\n is recorded, but recorded in tiny little bites,\n\n24:59.340 --> 25:02.860\n it's very, very easy for me to wave every last little foolish,\n\n25:02.860 --> 25:05.420\n ignorant, incorrect, or correct thing that someone\n\n25:05.420 --> 25:08.460\n has ever said or done in their face to support whatever\n\n25:08.460 --> 25:11.500\n argument that I'm trying to make about them or a situation.\n\n25:11.500 --> 25:14.620\n And I think that you mentioned cancel culture,\n\n25:15.340 --> 25:16.300\n as it seems to exist.\n\n25:16.300 --> 25:17.740\n Obviously, this is poisonous on its face.\n\n25:17.740 --> 25:18.540\n This is poisonous.\n\n25:20.140 --> 25:22.540\n It's the sort of thing that doesn't incentivize\n\n25:22.540 --> 25:23.820\n proper behavior.\n\n25:23.820 --> 25:26.380\n I mean, you look at, let's say one of the great monsters\n\n25:26.380 --> 25:30.460\n of history, Adolf Hitler, obviously, who's done awful,\n\n25:30.460 --> 25:33.020\n awful things, but also for anyone that's even a minor\n\n25:33.020 --> 25:35.580\n student of history, did some positive things as well.\n\n25:36.620 --> 25:39.340\n I don't have to embroider this person's crimes.\n\n25:39.340 --> 25:43.340\n I don't have to act as if there was nothing good a monster has\n\n25:43.340 --> 25:46.540\n ever done and nothing bad that a great person throughout history\n\n25:46.540 --> 25:47.500\n has ever done.\n\n25:47.500 --> 25:50.700\n But imagine the ghost of Adolf Hitler were to pop up and go,\n\n25:50.700 --> 25:52.460\n oh, my gosh, guys, I'm so sorry.\n\n25:52.460 --> 25:55.500\n I know what I've done, but I'd like to apologize and start\n\n25:55.500 --> 25:56.220\n to make it right.\n\n25:56.780 --> 25:59.180\n Well, I mean, you'd hope that if he popped up over here,\n\n25:59.180 --> 26:01.340\n you'd go, well, I don't really like what you've done.\n\n26:01.340 --> 26:02.380\n And I don't like you.\n\n26:02.380 --> 26:04.940\n But at the same time, I'm glad to hear that you're attempting\n\n26:04.940 --> 26:07.180\n to make this right and push in a positive direction, even if\n\n26:07.180 --> 26:08.300\n you can't make it right.\n\n26:08.300 --> 26:09.980\n Because otherwise, what am I doing?\n\n26:09.980 --> 26:12.460\n I'm disincentivizing change for the better.\n\n26:12.460 --> 26:15.500\n I'm looking to wield whatever power I have in a punitive\n\n26:15.500 --> 26:19.340\n fashion, which does not encourage people to do anything\n\n26:19.340 --> 26:22.220\n other than double down on the wrongs that they've made,\n\n26:22.220 --> 26:24.540\n knowing that at least they're going to have some support from\n\n26:24.540 --> 26:26.220\n the people that support that.\n\n26:26.220 --> 26:30.540\n And I guess I want to, you would hopefully look at the use\n\n26:30.540 --> 26:34.140\n of the internet as a tool that can educate, and I guess I\n\n26:34.140 --> 26:36.860\n don't like the word empower, but empower people to do various\n\n26:36.860 --> 26:40.220\n things, extend their reach, but educate and learn rather than\n\n26:40.220 --> 26:44.300\n to further solidify little tribal things that exist, which\n\n26:44.300 --> 26:47.180\n I think everyone in humanity and human history is vulnerable\n\n26:47.180 --> 26:47.340\n to.\n\n26:47.340 --> 26:48.940\n I mean, look at the course of human history.\n\n26:48.940 --> 26:50.300\n It's deeply tribal.\n\n26:50.300 --> 26:53.420\n And the tribes or the groups that have been on top at various\n\n26:53.420 --> 26:56.620\n points in time have done a lot of times bad things to the\n\n26:56.620 --> 26:57.900\n ones that have not.\n\n26:57.900 --> 27:00.300\n And you'd hope that we could learn lessons from the past\n\n27:00.300 --> 27:04.940\n and rather than committing the crimes that were committed\n\n27:04.940 --> 27:07.980\n against us, recommitting them when we slide into the top\n\n27:07.980 --> 27:12.140\n position, say, I could do this now, but I'll not.\n\n27:12.140 --> 27:15.180\n I understand the urge to seek vengeance is strong.\n\n27:15.180 --> 27:17.020\n Anyone that says differently, I wouldn't trust.\n\n27:18.140 --> 27:21.900\n But at the same time, we have enough experience in history,\n\n27:21.900 --> 27:25.340\n enough experience in life, enough hopefully wisdom time in\n\n27:25.340 --> 27:27.820\n to go, this isn't the right answer.\n\n27:27.820 --> 27:29.820\n This is only going to replay the things.\n\n27:29.820 --> 27:31.980\n The worst parts of our history, not the best.\n\n27:31.980 --> 27:34.540\n And I want to encourage positive behavior.\n\n27:34.540 --> 27:37.660\n And if I just, again, further lash out at people, although\n\n27:37.660 --> 27:41.180\n understandably, done understandably, I'm simply just\n\n27:41.180 --> 27:43.500\n going to just perpetuate the cycle that's gone on to this\n\n27:43.500 --> 27:44.060\n point.\n\n27:44.060 --> 27:47.660\n So you hope that even though we're seeing a lot of turmoil\n\n27:47.660 --> 27:51.180\n societally at the moment and globally at the moment, that I\n\n27:51.180 --> 27:53.500\n guess our better angels can prevail at a certain point.\n\n27:53.500 --> 27:55.420\n But it's going to take a great deal of leadership.\n\n27:55.420 --> 27:58.700\n And I think that we're sorely missing like a Martin Luther\n\n27:58.700 --> 28:01.020\n King style character at the moment or a great leader.\n\n28:01.020 --> 28:04.220\n And I'm hoping that one will show up.\n\n28:04.220 --> 28:05.420\n For sure.\n\n28:05.420 --> 28:08.540\n And by the way, a word I don't hear often, and I think it's\n\n28:08.540 --> 28:10.460\n a beautiful one, which is grace.\n\n28:10.460 --> 28:11.660\n That's a really interesting word.\n\n28:11.660 --> 28:12.780\n I'm going to have to think about that.\n\n28:13.740 --> 28:16.940\n There is a religious component to it, but it's exactly right.\n\n28:18.620 --> 28:23.980\n You have to somehow walk the line between, you know, you\n\n28:23.980 --> 28:24.940\n mentioned Hitler.\n\n28:24.940 --> 28:28.460\n I've been reading The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\n\n28:28.460 --> 28:33.820\n I'm really thinking about the 1930s and what it's like to\n\n28:33.820 --> 28:36.140\n have economic.\n\n28:36.860 --> 28:40.300\n My concern is the economic pain that people are feeling now\n\n28:41.100 --> 28:45.660\n quietly is really a suffering that's not being heard.\n\n28:46.380 --> 28:50.780\n And there's echoes of that in the 20s and the 30s with the\n\n28:50.780 --> 28:51.500\n Great Depression.\n\n28:52.300 --> 28:55.260\n And there's a hunger for a charismatic leader.\n\n28:55.260 --> 28:59.500\n Like you said, there's a leader that could walk with grace,\n\n29:00.060 --> 29:07.100\n could inspire, could bring people together with sort of dreams\n\n29:07.100 --> 29:09.260\n of a better future that's positive.\n\n29:09.900 --> 29:14.140\n But Hitler did exactly everything that I just said, except\n\n29:14.140 --> 29:18.780\n for the word positive, which is he did give a dream to the\n\n29:18.780 --> 29:21.820\n German people who were great people, who are great people\n\n29:21.820 --> 29:24.540\n of a better future.\n\n29:25.260 --> 29:31.420\n It's just that a certain point that quickly turned into the\n\n29:31.420 --> 29:37.900\n better future requires literally expansion of more land.\n\n29:37.900 --> 29:42.460\n It started with, well, if we want to build a great Germany,\n\n29:42.460 --> 29:43.980\n we need a little bit more land.\n\n29:44.620 --> 29:49.180\n And so we need to kind of get Austria, then we need to kind\n\n29:49.180 --> 29:55.100\n of get France, mostly because France doesn't understand that\n\n29:55.100 --> 29:56.300\n more land is really useful.\n\n29:56.300 --> 29:57.420\n So we need to get rid of them.\n\n29:57.420 --> 29:59.260\n And look what they did to us in Versailles anyway.\n\n30:01.820 --> 30:09.980\n But so the Jewish, the Holocaust is a separate thing.\n\n30:09.980 --> 30:10.460\n I don't know.\n\n30:12.060 --> 30:12.620\n Well, I don't know.\n\n30:12.620 --> 30:15.820\n I don't know what to think of it because so me being Jewish\n\n30:15.820 --> 30:21.900\n and having a lot of the echoes of the suffering is in my\n\n30:21.900 --> 30:23.660\n family or the people that are lost.\n\n30:24.780 --> 30:28.380\n I don't know because Hitler wrote all about it in Mein Kampf.\n\n30:28.380 --> 30:32.140\n So I don't know if the evil he committed was there all along.\n\n30:32.780 --> 30:36.780\n I mean, and that's where the question of forgiveness, I mean,\n\n30:36.780 --> 30:39.420\n Hitler is such a difficult person to talk about, but it's\n\n30:39.420 --> 30:46.380\n the question of cancer culture, who is deserving of forgiveness\n\n30:46.380 --> 30:50.940\n and who is not like the Holocaust survivors that I've read\n\n30:50.940 --> 30:52.620\n about that I've heard the interviews with.\n\n30:53.340 --> 30:58.300\n They've often spoken about the fact that the way for them\n\n30:58.300 --> 31:05.020\n to let go, to overcome the atrocities that they've experienced\n\n31:05.020 --> 31:05.900\n is to forgive.\n\n31:05.900 --> 31:09.420\n Like forgiveness is the way out for them.\n\n31:09.980 --> 31:11.340\n It's interesting to think about.\n\n31:11.340 --> 31:15.820\n I don't know if we're even as a society ready to even\n\n31:15.820 --> 31:18.300\n contemplate an idea of forgiveness for Hitler.\n\n31:19.180 --> 31:20.780\n It's an interesting idea though.\n\n31:21.500 --> 31:26.140\n It's a good thought exercise at the very least to think about\n\n31:26.140 --> 31:31.740\n like all these people that are being canceled for doing bad\n\n31:31.740 --> 31:33.100\n things of different degrees.\n\n31:33.100 --> 31:36.300\n Think of like Louis CK or somebody like that for being\n\n31:36.300 --> 31:40.300\n not a good person, but like, what is the path for forgiveness?\n\n31:40.300 --> 31:41.900\n And also what's a good person?\n\n31:41.900 --> 31:43.020\n What is a good person?\n\n31:43.020 --> 31:46.380\n If that's a sliding scale that we could all find ourselves\n\n31:46.380 --> 31:49.580\n looking at the uncomfortable end of a gun on, you know,\n\n31:49.580 --> 31:50.780\n particularly down the line.\n\n31:50.780 --> 31:53.660\n I mean, you hope for the best, but these definitions, I guess,\n\n31:53.660 --> 31:56.060\n like you said, are important and who's doing the canceling,\n\n31:56.060 --> 31:57.100\n who's being canceled.\n\n31:57.100 --> 32:00.300\n I'm not necessarily, as you said, saying that that's entirely\n\n32:00.300 --> 32:03.340\n unjustified or certainly not, it's certainly understandable.\n\n32:03.340 --> 32:05.820\n And particularly you mentioned like a monster, like an Adolf\n\n32:05.820 --> 32:07.420\n Hitler, but it's also interesting.\n\n32:07.420 --> 32:10.220\n I couldn't help but notice, like you mentioned as a society,\n\n32:10.220 --> 32:13.100\n us being able to apply forgiveness to someone who's\n\n32:13.100 --> 32:17.020\n done so much horror, but people who are personal, I mean,\n\n32:17.020 --> 32:18.940\n of course, many of us, so many people in person affected,\n\n32:18.940 --> 32:21.420\n but directly personally affected someone, a survivor of the\n\n32:21.420 --> 32:24.060\n Holocaust being able to let go on that.\n\n32:24.060 --> 32:27.020\n I'm nowhere near big enough a person for that sort of thing.\n\n32:27.020 --> 32:31.340\n But I guess that's an interesting thing, you know, being\n\n32:31.340 --> 32:35.820\n the person who was physically there, potentially able to\n\n32:35.820 --> 32:39.660\n let go, I don't know, that's unbelievably powerful.\n\n32:39.660 --> 32:40.300\n It's interesting.\n\n32:40.300 --> 32:42.780\n I guess you have to wonder sometimes, and this isn't\n\n32:42.780 --> 32:47.020\n obviously in regards to the Holocaust, but why I'm holding\n\n32:47.020 --> 32:50.300\n on to various things, have I, what is it doing for me and\n\n32:50.300 --> 32:51.660\n what is it doing to me?\n\n32:51.660 --> 32:53.500\n Is it facilitative, is it not?\n\n32:53.500 --> 32:55.980\n And I guess that's something else that I really want to\n\n32:55.980 --> 32:57.980\n talk about, something else that I really enjoy.\n\n32:57.980 --> 33:01.580\n When I was on Ultimate Fighter, they don't let you have any\n\n33:01.580 --> 33:02.460\n music or any books.\n\n33:02.460 --> 33:04.220\n I didn't have religious texts, so I brought a Bible and I\n\n33:04.220 --> 33:06.940\n brought a Quran and I started to read them side by side.\n\n33:06.940 --> 33:08.780\n And it was really interesting reading.\n\n33:08.780 --> 33:11.260\n The Bible's a little drier, the Quran's more interesting,\n\n33:11.260 --> 33:11.900\n at least written.\n\n33:11.900 --> 33:17.900\n But I think something that was consistently brought up was\n\n33:17.900 --> 33:20.220\n the way, most merciful.\n\n33:20.220 --> 33:22.700\n People want, I don't think any of us want justice.\n\n33:22.700 --> 33:25.500\n We think we want justice, but I don't think we want justice.\n\n33:25.500 --> 33:28.700\n This is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous game, because maybe\n\n33:28.700 --> 33:31.180\n this person's wronged me deeply and I want justice.\n\n33:31.180 --> 33:32.940\n I want to balance it out, because what is justice if not\n\n33:32.940 --> 33:34.300\n a balancing of the scales?\n\n33:34.300 --> 33:36.060\n And sometimes you can understand it on a societal\n\n33:36.060 --> 33:36.940\n level, I think it's fine.\n\n33:36.940 --> 33:39.500\n I mean, there's crime and punishment and we can go for\n\n33:39.500 --> 33:41.100\n the benefits and the drawbacks of that.\n\n33:41.100 --> 33:46.300\n But I think what any of us want is mercy within reason, grace,\n\n33:46.300 --> 33:48.860\n as you mentioned, because justice is a very, very, very\n\n33:48.860 --> 33:51.660\n dangerous thing and it's a valuable and important thing.\n\n33:51.660 --> 33:55.020\n But who gets to decide what's just, what justice is actually\n\n33:55.020 --> 33:55.500\n meted out?\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:57.980\n Maybe I get to meet out justice, but it's not, I don't get\n\n33:57.980 --> 33:58.620\n my comeuppance.\n\n33:58.620 --> 34:00.940\n Well, that sounds great, but what happens when it's pointed\n\n34:00.940 --> 34:01.420\n back at me?\n\n34:02.060 --> 34:05.740\n And I guess that comes back to the veil of ignorance, the\n\n34:05.740 --> 34:08.620\n idea that one day I will have to live in the world in which\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:10.620\n I've envisioned and the world in which I've created.\n\n34:11.500 --> 34:15.580\n I think that a lot of times people love the idea of they're\n\n34:15.580 --> 34:18.220\n a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs.\n\n34:18.220 --> 34:19.420\n And I heard that the other day.\n\n34:19.420 --> 34:20.620\n I thought that was great.\n\n34:20.620 --> 34:23.980\n And I think that's a dangerous thing and hopefully it gives\n\n34:23.980 --> 34:27.820\n us all pause before rightly or wrongly, but always understandably\n\n34:29.180 --> 34:30.940\n wielding serious power.\n\n34:30.940 --> 34:31.180\n Yeah.\n\n34:31.180 --> 34:32.620\n Justice is a kind of drug.\n\n34:32.620 --> 34:35.500\n So if you look at history, I've also been reading a lot\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:36.460\n about Stalin.\n\n34:36.460 --> 34:42.540\n I mean, all those folks really, I don't know what was inside\n\n34:42.540 --> 34:45.500\n Hitler's head actually that he's a tricky one because I think\n\n34:45.500 --> 34:47.020\n he was legitimately insane.\n\n34:47.660 --> 34:48.700\n Stalin was not.\n\n34:48.700 --> 34:53.500\n And Stalin was like, he literally thought he's doing a good\n\n34:53.500 --> 34:53.980\n thing.\n\n34:54.540 --> 34:59.180\n He literally thought for the entirety of the time that communism\n\n34:59.180 --> 35:02.860\n is going to bring, like that's the utopia and he's going to\n\n35:03.580 --> 35:05.020\n create a happy world.\n\n35:05.500 --> 35:13.020\n And in his, in his mind were ideas of justice, of fairness,\n\n35:13.020 --> 35:19.420\n of happiness, of, of yeah, human flourishing.\n\n35:19.420 --> 35:23.820\n And that's, that's a drug and it's somehow sadly pollutes the\n\n35:23.820 --> 35:26.220\n mind when you start thinking like that, what's good for\n\n35:26.220 --> 35:30.860\n society and believing that you have a good sense of what's\n\n35:30.860 --> 35:31.740\n good for society.\n\n35:32.700 --> 35:35.580\n That's intoxicating, especially when others around you are\n\n35:35.580 --> 35:36.780\n feeling the same way.\n\n35:36.780 --> 35:40.220\n And then you start like building up this movement and you\n\n35:40.220 --> 35:45.180\n forget that you are just like, you're, you're like barely\n\n35:45.180 --> 35:46.860\n recently evolved from an ape.\n\n35:46.860 --> 35:48.940\n Like you don't know what the hell you're doing.\n\n35:48.940 --> 35:51.260\n And then you start like killing witches or whatever.\n\n35:51.260 --> 35:52.700\n Like you start, you start doing.\n\n35:52.700 --> 35:53.420\n They did math.\n\n35:53.420 --> 35:54.220\n Let's be honest though.\n\n35:54.220 --> 35:55.740\n I mean, sometimes you got a witch has to go.\n\n35:56.620 --> 35:56.780\n Yeah.\n\n35:56.780 --> 36:00.300\n We can all agree that a witch, a witch has to go if, if it\n\n36:00.300 --> 36:02.860\n floats or sinks, which one, I forget which one.\n\n36:02.860 --> 36:04.460\n Whichever one we need at the time, honestly.\n\n36:04.460 --> 36:05.020\n Is it floating?\n\n36:05.020 --> 36:05.580\n It should have sunk.\n\n36:07.740 --> 36:09.980\n Yeah, but yeah, we can definitely agree that witches\n\n36:09.980 --> 36:13.420\n have to go because you brought it up.\n\n36:13.420 --> 36:18.540\n I tweeted recently, but also just, I'm one of the things\n\n36:18.540 --> 36:22.540\n I'm really ashamed of in my life is I haven't really read\n\n36:22.540 --> 36:24.780\n almost any of the sci fi classics.\n\n36:24.780 --> 36:25.100\n Really?\n\n36:25.660 --> 36:25.900\n Yeah.\n\n36:25.900 --> 36:28.780\n So like I, my whole journey through reading was through\n\n36:29.500 --> 36:35.500\n like the literary philosophers that would say like Camus,\n\n36:35.500 --> 36:41.100\n Hase, Dostoevsky, Kafka, like that place, like that's a kind\n\n36:41.100 --> 36:47.980\n of sci fi world in itself, but it's, it just, it creates a\n\n36:47.980 --> 36:53.340\n world in which the, the deepest questions about human nature\n\n36:53.340 --> 36:54.220\n can be explored.\n\n36:55.580 --> 37:00.140\n I didn't realize this, but the sci fi world is the same.\n\n37:00.140 --> 37:03.740\n It just puts it in a, it like removes it from any kind of\n\n37:03.740 --> 37:07.020\n historical context where you can explore those same ideas\n\n37:07.020 --> 37:09.500\n in like space somewhere elsewhere in a different time,\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:10.540\n a different place.\n\n37:10.540 --> 37:13.740\n It allows you almost like more freedom to like construct\n\n37:13.740 --> 37:17.980\n these artificial things where you can just do crazy, crazy\n\n37:17.980 --> 37:19.100\n kind of human experiments.\n\n37:19.100 --> 37:21.980\n So I'm now working through it.\n\n37:21.980 --> 37:25.980\n The books on my list are the foundation series by\n\n37:25.980 --> 37:32.940\n Isaac Asimov, Dune, Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson and\n\n37:32.940 --> 37:34.060\n Ender's Game, like you mentioned.\n\n37:34.940 --> 37:37.580\n That's just kind of, and then, so I posted that.\n\n37:37.580 --> 37:41.820\n And then of course, like Elon Musk, John Carmack, I don't\n\n37:41.820 --> 37:43.740\n know if you know him, creator of Doom and Quake.\n\n37:43.740 --> 37:44.140\n Oh, cool.\n\n37:44.700 --> 37:47.660\n See, they all pitched in these nerds, these ultra nerds\n\n37:47.660 --> 37:52.060\n just started like going like these, you need to read this,\n\n37:52.060 --> 37:53.340\n that and the other.\n\n37:53.340 --> 37:55.660\n So I've like started working out.\n\n37:55.660 --> 37:56.160\n Okay.\n\n37:56.460 --> 38:00.220\n But it seems like the list I've mentioned holds up somewhat.\n\n38:00.220 --> 38:01.660\n Is there a book?\n\n38:01.660 --> 38:10.060\n Is there sci fi books or series or authors that you find\n\n38:10.060 --> 38:11.260\n are just amazing?\n\n38:11.260 --> 38:13.820\n Maybe another way to ask that is like, what's the greatest\n\n38:13.820 --> 38:15.260\n sci fi book of all time?\n\n38:15.260 --> 38:18.540\n Well, I'd like to start by sharing something that I'm\n\n38:18.540 --> 38:21.820\n embarrassed about is that I haven't read anything other\n\n38:21.820 --> 38:26.620\n than, you know, Orson Scott Card, J.R. Tolkien,\n\n38:26.620 --> 38:28.140\n Frank Herbert Tolkien.\n\n38:28.140 --> 38:33.980\n Yeah, I'm aware through Wikipedia and through surface\n\n38:33.980 --> 38:36.060\n reading of things that like a book called the Republic\n\n38:36.060 --> 38:36.780\n was written once.\n\n38:38.540 --> 38:39.100\n There were some other...\n\n38:39.100 --> 38:40.780\n Do you read Wikipedia?\n\n38:40.780 --> 38:43.740\n You're a prolific reader of Wikipedia articles.\n\n38:43.740 --> 38:45.020\n Well, or occasional.\n\n38:45.020 --> 38:46.460\n Occasional reader.\n\n38:46.460 --> 38:47.020\n Exactly.\n\n38:47.020 --> 38:50.060\n In between whatever else it is that I waste my time on.\n\n38:50.060 --> 38:53.900\n But yeah, so I also, I should say, I posted on Reddit\n\n38:53.900 --> 38:57.500\n questions for Ryan Hall and there's like a million\n\n38:57.500 --> 39:01.020\n questions, but like half of them have to do with Dune.\n\n39:01.020 --> 39:01.660\n No, not really.\n\n39:01.660 --> 39:03.340\n But like people bring up Dune.\n\n39:03.340 --> 39:04.300\n I don't understand why.\n\n39:05.100 --> 39:06.700\n Did you mention Dune before?\n\n39:06.700 --> 39:08.380\n Well, actually, we actually have a showy role actually\n\n39:08.380 --> 39:11.660\n made us a Gi, a Dune themed Gi one time, which I thought\n\n39:11.660 --> 39:12.460\n was kind of cool.\n\n39:12.460 --> 39:12.860\n I'll send you.\n\n39:12.860 --> 39:13.260\n I'll give you one.\n\n39:13.260 --> 39:14.220\n We got extra stuff.\n\n39:14.220 --> 39:17.900\n But actually, to your point, actually, this is Orson Scott\n\n39:17.900 --> 39:19.820\n Card quote, actually the writer of Ender's Game.\n\n39:20.620 --> 39:22.460\n Fiction, because it's not about somebody who actually\n\n39:22.460 --> 39:25.340\n lived in the real world always has the possibility of being\n\n39:25.340 --> 39:26.140\n about oneself.\n\n39:26.140 --> 39:29.900\n And I think that's a neat thing because I have heard other\n\n39:30.700 --> 39:33.260\n people whom I respect and very sharp people actually every\n\n39:33.260 --> 39:35.340\n now and then dig their heels and going, I don't like fiction.\n\n39:35.340 --> 39:36.220\n I only like nonfiction.\n\n39:36.220 --> 39:37.500\n It's more instructive.\n\n39:37.500 --> 39:39.740\n And I would go, I completely disagree with that.\n\n39:39.740 --> 39:41.980\n I think we have a hard enough time figuring out what happened\n\n39:41.980 --> 39:45.580\n at 711 three hours ago that, let me tell you what happened\n\n39:45.580 --> 39:47.180\n 600 years BC.\n\n39:47.180 --> 39:48.220\n I'm like, hey, I'm interested.\n\n39:48.220 --> 39:49.820\n But don't tell me this isn't a story too.\n\n39:49.820 --> 39:50.300\n Yeah.\n\n39:50.300 --> 39:54.060\n There's factual components, I have no doubt.\n\n39:54.060 --> 39:57.500\n But we struggle sometimes to like, I guess what I like\n\n39:57.500 --> 40:00.300\n about fiction is that you can tell me a story.\n\n40:00.300 --> 40:01.580\n It's all about people.\n\n40:01.580 --> 40:04.460\n I mean, every now there's more and less believable things.\n\n40:04.460 --> 40:06.860\n And I think Dune would be an unbelievably well written,\n\n40:06.860 --> 40:09.100\n in my opinion, for to run, what do I know?\n\n40:09.100 --> 40:12.220\n But I really liked doing, I'll say that well written example\n\n40:12.220 --> 40:15.900\n of human beings interacting with one another, the political\n\n40:15.900 --> 40:18.780\n component to that, the emotional, the intellectual, the\n\n40:18.780 --> 40:20.300\n relationship components, all of that.\n\n40:20.300 --> 40:23.660\n And I think that Dune is neat because it's a sci fi, not\n\n40:23.660 --> 40:26.620\n a sci fi novel, but only in the only in the loosest sense.\n\n40:26.620 --> 40:31.260\n It's really a story about religion, about group dynamics,\n\n40:31.260 --> 40:37.340\n about human potential, about belief, learning, politics,\n\n40:38.460 --> 40:40.300\n governance, ecology.\n\n40:40.300 --> 40:44.460\n It's the best stories remind me of history the same way\n\n40:44.460 --> 40:48.220\n history hopefully is not just a list of facts that I try to be\n\n40:48.220 --> 40:52.860\n able to recall or factoids that I try to recall, but a story\n\n40:52.860 --> 40:57.340\n that I can understand and see how the threads of time kind\n\n40:57.340 --> 40:59.340\n of came together and created certain things.\n\n40:59.340 --> 41:01.500\n And a lot of times, like we say, I'm like, how the heck is\n\n41:01.500 --> 41:04.060\n what's going on right now or 100 years from now or 100 years\n\n41:04.060 --> 41:04.940\n in the past happened.\n\n41:04.940 --> 41:06.300\n And you can look back far enough.\n\n41:06.300 --> 41:09.820\n If we had accurate knowledge, if we had that hypothetical\n\n41:09.820 --> 41:13.100\n perfect pool shot at the beginning of time, we would see\n\n41:13.100 --> 41:16.780\n an unbroken chain of events that led us to where we are and\n\n41:16.780 --> 41:18.780\n where we are will potentially lead us to where we're going,\n\n41:18.780 --> 41:20.140\n which is, again, why hindsight is helpful.\n\n41:20.140 --> 41:20.860\n But I think it's neat.\n\n41:20.860 --> 41:23.660\n Like, I guess I really enjoy, for instance, a book like\n\n41:23.660 --> 41:25.820\n Dune, and they're actually making a movie out of it, which\n\n41:25.820 --> 41:28.940\n I'm skeptical of, to be honest, because it's going to be\n\n41:28.940 --> 41:31.340\n difficult to bring that to the screen for a variety of\n\n41:31.340 --> 41:33.660\n reasons, but there's at least a hundred questions.\n\n41:33.660 --> 41:36.460\n Ask Ryan, what do you think about the new Dune movie?\n\n41:36.460 --> 41:39.020\n I am not enough of an authority to have any sort of decent\n\n41:39.020 --> 41:40.700\n opinion, but I guess what I would say is so much of it\n\n41:40.700 --> 41:41.820\n goes on in the character's mind.\n\n41:41.820 --> 41:45.580\n Like how much of any of our days is any lived experience,\n\n41:45.580 --> 41:49.100\n as it were, is internal, but the majority, how many times\n\n41:49.100 --> 41:52.060\n are people walking around and, you know, they're like, hey,\n\n41:52.060 --> 41:52.700\n what do you see right now?\n\n41:52.700 --> 41:54.300\n I'm like, oh, well, I see this picture.\n\n41:54.300 --> 41:54.780\n I see a wall.\n\n41:54.780 --> 41:55.660\n Hey, there's Lex.\n\n41:55.660 --> 41:58.620\n But really what I was paying attention to was what was\n\n41:58.620 --> 42:00.940\n going on inside of my head for a moment, and almost the rest\n\n42:00.940 --> 42:03.580\n of the world tuned out and kind of dimmed.\n\n42:03.580 --> 42:09.180\n And I guess I think that's going to be a struggle to any\n\n42:09.180 --> 42:12.940\n time you want to bring that type of a written story to a\n\n42:12.940 --> 42:13.740\n visual medium.\n\n42:13.740 --> 42:16.140\n I think it's going to be more difficult, but it'll be\n\n42:16.140 --> 42:16.620\n interesting.\n\n42:16.620 --> 42:19.500\n It's definitely one of my favorite stories, and it's\n\n42:20.620 --> 42:23.020\n honestly helped me become better at life, in my opinion,\n\n42:23.020 --> 42:24.220\n better at martial arts.\n\n42:24.220 --> 42:26.700\n And I think the writer, I think Frank Herbert was absolutely\n\n42:26.700 --> 42:28.780\n brilliant, whether those were all his ideas, which are not\n\n42:28.780 --> 42:29.260\n reality.\n\n42:29.260 --> 42:31.660\n None of us or all of our good ideas aren't ours.\n\n42:31.660 --> 42:32.300\n We're a combination.\n\n42:32.300 --> 42:34.060\n Maybe it came up with something you're a curator of other\n\n42:34.060 --> 42:36.140\n good ideas and some things you borrowed from somewhere\n\n42:36.140 --> 42:37.500\n without even realizing it.\n\n42:37.500 --> 42:40.940\n But I think the way the messages and the themes and the\n\n42:40.940 --> 42:43.100\n ideas that were conveyed, particularly in the original\n\n42:43.100 --> 42:45.420\n novel, are just absolutely brilliant.\n\n42:45.420 --> 42:50.940\n Is that to you one of the greats and the flip side of\n\n42:50.940 --> 42:54.780\n that, or another way to ask that is if somebody is new to\n\n42:54.780 --> 42:57.740\n sci fi, is that something you would recommend that is an\n\n42:57.740 --> 42:58.460\n entry point?\n\n42:58.460 --> 43:00.380\n I'm not well read enough in the sci fi world.\n\n43:00.380 --> 43:02.860\n I haven't read a lot of Isaac Asimov or anything like that,\n\n43:02.860 --> 43:04.940\n but I'll recommend Dune.\n\n43:04.940 --> 43:07.900\n I'll be an obnoxious evangelist for Dune to anyone who'll\n\n43:07.900 --> 43:08.140\n listen.\n\n43:08.700 --> 43:10.380\n So yeah, I would strongly recommend it.\n\n43:10.380 --> 43:13.180\n So the other thing you mentioned, now I should\n\n43:13.180 --> 43:15.340\n probably be talking to you about much more important\n\n43:15.340 --> 43:18.620\n things, but the other thing is Skyrim.\n\n43:19.740 --> 43:21.260\n Do you play video games?\n\n43:21.260 --> 43:22.540\n What's your favorite game?\n\n43:22.540 --> 43:24.860\n What's what would you say is the greatest video game of\n\n43:24.860 --> 43:25.180\n all time?\n\n43:25.180 --> 43:26.780\n Because I'm a huge fan of Elder Scrolls.\n\n43:26.780 --> 43:27.820\n Oh, yeah.\n\n43:27.820 --> 43:30.620\n I mean, I play a little bit at this point.\n\n43:30.620 --> 43:33.980\n You know, a little less finally moves into a new house.\n\n43:33.980 --> 43:35.580\n So you're like an adult.\n\n43:35.580 --> 43:36.700\n No, no, no, no.\n\n43:36.700 --> 43:38.220\n I'm like a better funded 12 year old.\n\n43:39.500 --> 43:43.180\n Yeah, that's yeah, that's entirely that's entirely\n\n43:43.180 --> 43:43.420\n accurate.\n\n43:43.420 --> 43:44.940\n Better funded 12 year old.\n\n43:44.940 --> 43:47.660\n But somewhat better funded 12 year old.\n\n43:47.660 --> 43:48.780\n Not as well funded as I wish.\n\n43:48.780 --> 43:50.620\n But historically, did you play video games?\n\n43:50.620 --> 43:51.660\n Oh, yeah, I played as a kid.\n\n43:51.660 --> 43:53.900\n I was, you know, again, I've always liked playing sports\n\n43:53.900 --> 43:56.460\n and liked reading and I always enjoyed video games.\n\n43:56.460 --> 43:59.100\n But my favorite video game I think I've ever played was\n\n43:59.100 --> 44:00.220\n Knights of the Old Republic.\n\n44:00.860 --> 44:01.740\n It was a Star Wars game.\n\n44:01.740 --> 44:05.500\n A huge Star Wars fan until it become less so recently.\n\n44:06.140 --> 44:06.540\n Disney.\n\n44:07.660 --> 44:09.580\n You don't like the, I haven't watched it yet.\n\n44:09.580 --> 44:11.020\n Oh, Mandalorian.\n\n44:11.020 --> 44:11.740\n Oh, don't go there.\n\n44:11.740 --> 44:13.180\n Oh, actually, I like Mandalorian.\n\n44:13.180 --> 44:14.060\n That was actually pretty cool.\n\n44:14.060 --> 44:15.420\n Yeah, waving this off.\n\n44:15.420 --> 44:17.340\n Yeah, yeah, I will.\n\n44:17.340 --> 44:20.140\n If I could cancel one thing, I would cancel Disney Star Wars.\n\n44:20.140 --> 44:21.260\n I'm going to edit that part out.\n\n44:21.260 --> 44:22.380\n Okay, let's go to the next.\n\n44:23.260 --> 44:26.300\n But this is where if people are wondering if you're watching\n\n44:26.300 --> 44:29.980\n this on YouTube and like the dislike amount is like 80%\n\n44:29.980 --> 44:31.500\n it's because of that comment.\n\n44:31.500 --> 44:32.860\n So good job.\n\n44:32.860 --> 44:34.700\n Good job for making the internet hate you.\n\n44:34.700 --> 44:35.740\n I regret nothing.\n\n44:35.740 --> 44:38.140\n Now, what about Baby Yoda?\n\n44:39.020 --> 44:41.340\n Yeah, I guess he's like little.\n\n44:41.340 --> 44:43.820\n He's got ears and he uses the force sometimes and he passes\n\n44:43.820 --> 44:44.300\n out again.\n\n44:44.300 --> 44:45.900\n No qualms with Baby Yoda.\n\n44:45.900 --> 44:47.100\n Yeah, you don't have a heart.\n\n44:47.100 --> 44:52.220\n Okay, let's go to Jiu Jitsu if it's okay.\n\n44:54.460 --> 44:58.540\n So the audience of this podcast may not know much about Jiu Jitsu\n\n44:59.420 --> 45:01.820\n or they do because it's really part of the culture now,\n\n45:01.820 --> 45:03.340\n but they don't really know much.\n\n45:04.540 --> 45:07.180\n They see that so many people have fallen in love with it,\n\n45:07.180 --> 45:09.020\n have been transformed through it, but they don't know much\n\n45:09.020 --> 45:10.620\n about like, what is this thing?\n\n45:10.620 --> 45:14.780\n Is there a way you could sort of try to explain what is\n\n45:14.780 --> 45:17.660\n Jiu Jitsu, what is the essence of this martial art that's\n\n45:17.660 --> 45:22.060\n captured the minds and hearts of so many people in the world?\n\n45:22.060 --> 45:27.100\n I think that Jiu Jitsu is a philosophy that's expressed\n\n45:27.100 --> 45:31.900\n physically and that it's the kind of development of the\n\n45:32.460 --> 45:38.220\n mental capacity and physical capacity working in unison to\n\n45:38.220 --> 45:45.420\n move efficiently and almost flowingly, unresistingly with\n\n45:45.420 --> 45:49.340\n a given situation, with a physically resisting opponent.\n\n45:50.380 --> 45:53.980\n Learning how to generate force on your own and how to steal\n\n45:53.980 --> 45:56.220\n force from the floor, how to steal force from the other\n\n45:56.220 --> 45:59.340\n person and move in concert with it as opposed to clash\n\n45:59.340 --> 46:01.980\n against, which if you watch two untrained people fight,\n\n46:01.980 --> 46:03.340\n it's almost entirely a clash.\n\n46:03.340 --> 46:05.500\n It's a runaway and clash, a runaway and clash.\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:10.300\n If you watch Jiu Jitsu done well, it looks like water\n\n46:10.300 --> 46:12.540\n moving around a solid structure.\n\n46:12.540 --> 46:15.580\n And I think that that is expressed physically.\n\n46:15.580 --> 46:19.020\n And I think that all of the things that anyone has really\n\n46:19.020 --> 46:22.540\n been able to do very, very well in Jiu Jitsu end up kind\n\n46:22.540 --> 46:24.060\n of exemplifying that.\n\n46:24.060 --> 46:26.300\n But I think that's true of martial arts in general.\n\n46:26.300 --> 46:28.700\n I think that a lot of times like the clashing that we see\n\n46:28.700 --> 46:33.020\n going on and working well is just the fact that it's\n\n46:33.020 --> 46:35.660\n you know, you get very, very physically powerful people\n\n46:35.660 --> 46:37.660\n every now and then they're able to get away with this.\n\n46:37.660 --> 46:39.900\n But I don't think that that's, and that's fantastic\n\n46:39.900 --> 46:41.660\n because ultimately it's a results driven thing.\n\n46:41.660 --> 46:44.220\n But I think that the essence of the martial arts is learning\n\n46:44.220 --> 46:46.300\n how to make more out of less and how to move with\n\n46:46.300 --> 46:49.580\n and be yielding, almost like real life Aikido.\n\n46:49.580 --> 46:53.580\n And so you think of martial arts, Jiu Jitsu as like water\n\n46:57.100 --> 47:01.100\n or flowing, so Aikido, so moving around a solid structure\n\n47:01.100 --> 47:06.100\n so Aikido, so moving around the force as opposed to sort of\n\n47:08.940 --> 47:12.620\n maybe the wrestling mindset is finding a leverage\n\n47:12.620 --> 47:15.100\n where you can apply an exceptional amount of force.\n\n47:15.100 --> 47:18.540\n So like, so like maximizing the application of force.\n\n47:18.540 --> 47:20.540\n I guess maybe that's a better way to, I'd like to marry\n\n47:20.540 --> 47:22.940\n the two ideas, you know, because I think you flow\n\n47:22.940 --> 47:25.020\n until the point at which you are the greater force\n\n47:25.020 --> 47:27.180\n at which point in time you can apply.\n\n47:27.180 --> 47:29.980\n But if you look at the best wrestlers and then when I say\n\n47:29.980 --> 47:31.580\n best, I don't necessarily mean most successful\n\n47:31.580 --> 47:33.900\n although of course most successful are always very\n\n47:33.900 --> 47:37.500\n very good throughout the course of history in boxing\n\n47:37.500 --> 47:41.820\n in wrestling, in Judo, they're magical.\n\n47:41.820 --> 47:43.500\n They disappear and reappear.\n\n47:43.500 --> 47:46.540\n It's like fighting a ghost that is like incorporeal\n\n47:46.540 --> 47:47.500\n when you want to find it.\n\n47:47.500 --> 47:49.580\n But then when you don't want it to find it\n\n47:49.580 --> 47:51.580\n when you don't want to find it, it finds you.\n\n47:51.580 --> 47:54.780\n And I think that we see that in the like the Bufais\n\n47:54.780 --> 47:56.380\n or societies of wrestling.\n\n47:56.380 --> 47:59.580\n And you know, I guess you could look at a Floyd Mayweather\n\n47:59.580 --> 48:03.580\n or Willie Pep or you know, Prunell Whitaker in boxing\n\n48:03.580 --> 48:07.740\n as brilliant examples of disappearing and reappearing.\n\n48:07.740 --> 48:10.780\n And when you're strong, it's almost like guerrilla warfare.\n\n48:10.780 --> 48:12.860\n When you're strong, I'm nowhere to be found.\n\n48:12.860 --> 48:14.940\n When you're weak, you can't get rid of me.\n\n48:14.940 --> 48:16.220\n And I think that's what we're looking for.\n\n48:16.220 --> 48:18.300\n Yes, the TF brothers are incredible at that.\n\n48:18.300 --> 48:23.100\n They just, they look like skinny Starbucks baristas\n\n48:23.100 --> 48:28.100\n and they just manhandle everybody like effortlessly.\n\n48:29.900 --> 48:31.820\n They look like they just kind of woke up,\n\n48:31.820 --> 48:35.820\n rolled out of bed, fighting for like the gold medal\n\n48:35.820 --> 48:38.540\n at the Olympics and just effortlessly throw,\n\n48:39.900 --> 48:42.700\n like there's a match against, I guess, Yul Romero.\n\n48:43.820 --> 48:46.140\n Yeah, so like, you know, if you look at like\n\n48:46.140 --> 48:49.180\n who is the guy who's like intimidating in this case\n\n48:49.180 --> 48:53.500\n and terrifying looking, it's Yul Romero,\n\n48:53.500 --> 48:55.980\n just like a physical specimen\n\n48:55.980 --> 48:58.220\n and obviously like a super accomplished wrestler.\n\n48:58.220 --> 49:00.540\n I think this is for the gold medal, yeah.\n\n49:00.540 --> 49:02.300\n In 2000.\n\n49:02.300 --> 49:03.140\n In 2000?\n\n49:03.140 --> 49:03.980\n Yeah, Sydney.\n\n49:03.980 --> 49:06.580\n And then there, this is the year you all took silver.\n\n49:08.460 --> 49:12.060\n And what you, like, just to show you like\n\n49:12.060 --> 49:15.100\n there's a inside trip, effortless.\n\n49:15.100 --> 49:17.020\n Uchi, and he does it again.\n\n49:17.020 --> 49:22.020\n Yep, you know, it's a really creative kind of wrestling\n\n49:22.260 --> 49:23.980\n where it's organic.\n\n49:23.980 --> 49:26.300\n Yeah, you throw in all of these kinds of things.\n\n49:26.300 --> 49:31.300\n This is a mix of judo, a mix of like weird kind of moves.\n\n49:31.340 --> 49:34.620\n It's not like as funky as Ben Askren.\n\n49:34.620 --> 49:39.020\n It's just like legitimate, basic.\n\n49:39.020 --> 49:40.700\n Well, it's not funky for funky sake.\n\n49:40.700 --> 49:42.660\n And I'm not poking at Ben Askren to imply\n\n49:42.660 --> 49:45.020\n that that's what he's doing, but it's like, it's funny.\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:47.220\n It's like, a lot of times it's almost like Musashi\n\n49:47.220 --> 49:48.460\n talked a lot about that.\n\n49:48.460 --> 49:51.180\n You know, that the only goal of combat is to win\n\n49:51.180 --> 49:53.460\n is the outcome is it's outcome driven\n\n49:53.460 --> 49:56.660\n versus like flourishing, you know, cool looking movements.\n\n49:56.660 --> 49:58.820\n It's like, unless that had a utilitarian purpose,\n\n49:58.820 --> 50:00.780\n like what are you wasting your time with that?\n\n50:00.780 --> 50:03.780\n Both in the fight and also, you know, in practice.\n\n50:03.780 --> 50:06.020\n But as you mentioned, it's almost like it looks like judo.\n\n50:06.020 --> 50:07.540\n It looks like wrestling, it looks like jujitsu.\n\n50:07.540 --> 50:09.780\n It's almost like, I guess the reminds me\n\n50:09.780 --> 50:12.660\n all of the martial arts is again, deeply tribal as well.\n\n50:12.660 --> 50:14.700\n I wanna learn Lex Fridman, martial arts.\n\n50:14.700 --> 50:16.900\n And then I wanna learn another, you know,\n\n50:16.900 --> 50:18.820\n I guess, transcendent person's martial arts.\n\n50:18.820 --> 50:20.620\n And it just happened to be the set of movements\n\n50:20.620 --> 50:22.620\n that you tended to do most of the time,\n\n50:22.620 --> 50:25.060\n thanks to your body type and your opposition and whatnot.\n\n50:25.060 --> 50:27.380\n But then I try to codify that and force those to work\n\n50:27.380 --> 50:30.900\n as opposed to going, I wanna understand how the body works\n\n50:30.900 --> 50:33.660\n in concert and in Congress with something else\n\n50:33.660 --> 50:36.140\n and other forces and move appropriately.\n\n50:36.140 --> 50:37.740\n And that's why it's like, it always struck me\n\n50:37.740 --> 50:39.620\n that the Saiki brothers are great examples\n\n50:39.620 --> 50:41.940\n of just moving like water, but they,\n\n50:41.940 --> 50:43.820\n to use Bruce Lee, which is a little trite,\n\n50:43.820 --> 50:44.660\n but again, he's brilliant.\n\n50:44.660 --> 50:47.060\n It's like water can flow or water can crash.\n\n50:47.060 --> 50:48.540\n And they would crash when they needed to crash\n\n50:48.540 --> 50:49.780\n and they would flow when they needed to flow,\n\n50:49.780 --> 50:51.820\n but they would flow for the purpose of dissipating\n\n50:51.820 --> 50:53.580\n and then crash when they would win.\n\n50:53.580 --> 50:55.580\n And at the right moment, then go back to flowing\n\n50:55.580 --> 50:57.140\n the second that the other person found them.\n\n50:57.140 --> 50:59.860\n And it's just, it's beautiful to watch, it's artistic.\n\n50:59.860 --> 51:02.260\n And I think that that great expression of anything physical\n\n51:02.260 --> 51:04.260\n is ultimately studied as a science,\n\n51:04.260 --> 51:05.260\n but expressed as an art.\n\n51:05.260 --> 51:06.700\n And I think that that's something that gets lost\n\n51:06.700 --> 51:08.940\n in jujitsu a lot of times when it gets a little bit,\n\n51:08.940 --> 51:10.860\n a little nerdy, like do this hand here, hand here.\n\n51:10.860 --> 51:12.460\n Like it's like the more details I have,\n\n51:12.460 --> 51:15.300\n the better when in reality, that's just not,\n\n51:15.300 --> 51:17.860\n not in my experience, how it's done.\n\n51:17.860 --> 51:21.260\n Might be fun exercise of saying like,\n\n51:21.260 --> 51:25.700\n what are the main positions and submissions\n\n51:25.700 --> 51:27.860\n in the art of jujitsu?\n\n51:27.860 --> 51:30.380\n You don't have to be complete, that's a ridiculously,\n\n51:30.380 --> 51:32.300\n I apologize for putting you on a spot like this,\n\n51:32.300 --> 51:35.020\n but it might be a nice exercise to think through it.\n\n51:35.020 --> 51:37.300\n Sure, I mean, I would just say that there,\n\n51:37.300 --> 51:39.460\n you have your arms bend in various ways.\n\n51:39.460 --> 51:41.820\n You have key lock Americana, straight arm locks,\n\n51:41.820 --> 51:43.940\n Kimura, omoplata, omoplata is a Kimura,\n\n51:43.940 --> 51:45.460\n Kimura is an omoplata, it's just executed.\n\n51:45.460 --> 51:46.300\n Submissions.\n\n51:46.300 --> 51:47.140\n Submissions, yes.\n\n51:47.140 --> 51:49.580\n Breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways.\n\n51:49.580 --> 51:51.460\n But ultimately, the question is,\n\n51:51.460 --> 51:52.660\n let's say you were a Terminator,\n\n51:52.660 --> 51:54.580\n like a robot that I, which of course you are.\n\n51:54.580 --> 51:55.420\n Go on.\n\n51:55.420 --> 51:56.260\n Go on.\n\n51:56.260 --> 51:58.980\n It's like, all right, so we're being completely literal.\n\n51:58.980 --> 52:02.060\n But, and I couldn't harm you with any of these things.\n\n52:02.060 --> 52:03.580\n Would I still use these positions?\n\n52:03.580 --> 52:04.420\n The answer is yes.\n\n52:04.420 --> 52:06.620\n They create leverage, they create control,\n\n52:06.620 --> 52:08.540\n they create shapes that I can affect\n\n52:08.540 --> 52:10.700\n and that can affect me and they can be affected\n\n52:10.700 --> 52:13.140\n through other forces and other objects or structures\n\n52:13.140 --> 52:14.220\n like the ground or the wall.\n\n52:14.220 --> 52:15.420\n I really enjoy mixed martial arts\n\n52:15.420 --> 52:17.380\n because there's another component\n\n52:17.380 --> 52:18.980\n rather than just me and you and the floor,\n\n52:18.980 --> 52:20.600\n there's me, you, the floor, and the wall.\n\n52:20.600 --> 52:21.940\n And it's another player in the game\n\n52:21.940 --> 52:24.580\n that doesn't exist in a grappling context\n\n52:24.580 --> 52:28.580\n with a non enclosed, I guess, area of combat.\n\n52:28.580 --> 52:32.980\n But you can strangle me or choke me,\n\n52:32.980 --> 52:35.940\n what do you call it, without my arms being involved,\n\n52:35.940 --> 52:37.800\n or you can use one of my shoulders\n\n52:37.800 --> 52:40.220\n to pin one side of my, one carotid artery off\n\n52:40.220 --> 52:41.620\n and you can enclose the other.\n\n52:41.620 --> 52:43.980\n You can turn my knee in the exact same ways\n\n52:43.980 --> 52:47.460\n that you can turn my arm straight this way and that way.\n\n52:47.460 --> 52:48.820\n You can add a rotation to that\n\n52:48.820 --> 52:51.140\n or it can be directly linear against the joint.\n\n52:51.140 --> 52:52.840\n So I guess what I would say is the more\n\n52:52.840 --> 52:55.180\n that I've been able to understand jiu jitsu,\n\n52:55.180 --> 52:58.300\n the more that I've been, it's given me a look\n\n52:58.300 --> 53:01.260\n into how we learn language where rather\n\n53:01.260 --> 53:03.260\n than learning five bazillion adjectives,\n\n53:03.260 --> 53:05.260\n I go, I understand what an adjective is.\n\n53:05.260 --> 53:06.260\n And of course we are all read\n\n53:06.260 --> 53:09.100\n into some degree of vocabulary.\n\n53:09.100 --> 53:11.220\n I understand what an adverb does\n\n53:11.220 --> 53:12.980\n and I understand what an adverb is.\n\n53:12.980 --> 53:13.900\n I know what a noun is.\n\n53:13.900 --> 53:16.060\n I know what the component parts of a sentence are.\n\n53:16.060 --> 53:18.220\n I know what, you know, I guess a clause,\n\n53:18.220 --> 53:19.740\n a contraction, any of these things.\n\n53:19.740 --> 53:23.220\n And it allows you to be interesting and artistic\n\n53:23.220 --> 53:25.340\n with your language to the extent that you can.\n\n53:25.340 --> 53:27.540\n But I can't, like I can speak a degree of Spanish,\n\n53:27.540 --> 53:29.760\n but I'm not even slightly artistic in Spanish.\n\n53:29.760 --> 53:32.780\n I would be something, I speak like a child\n\n53:32.780 --> 53:33.740\n with a head injury.\n\n53:33.740 --> 53:35.980\n And anyway, the I.\n\n53:35.980 --> 53:38.220\n Your basic understanding of the English language\n\n53:38.220 --> 53:40.540\n allows you to then be a student of Spanish.\n\n53:40.540 --> 53:43.140\n 100%, but I'm limited by my experience.\n\n53:43.140 --> 53:45.620\n I'm limited by my understanding of techniques.\n\n53:45.620 --> 53:47.620\n I'm limited by my understanding, almost like,\n\n53:47.620 --> 53:51.060\n let's say techniques are like these are like vocabulary.\n\n53:51.060 --> 53:54.220\n So even if I kind of sort of grasp the sentence structure\n\n53:54.220 --> 53:56.660\n and the thought process and the thought patterns\n\n53:56.660 --> 53:58.420\n of Spanish, which it's interesting\n\n53:58.420 --> 54:00.580\n because just even though the orientation\n\n54:00.580 --> 54:01.780\n and the organization of a language,\n\n54:01.780 --> 54:03.780\n and I've thought about this a great deal,\n\n54:03.780 --> 54:05.340\n you know, the way that I perceive the world\n\n54:05.340 --> 54:07.820\n is affected deeply by the language that I learned.\n\n54:07.820 --> 54:09.540\n The, you know, the, again, if I learned,\n\n54:09.540 --> 54:11.740\n I have no idea how the Chinese language structures,\n\n54:11.740 --> 54:13.520\n but I can only imagine that it would be,\n\n54:13.520 --> 54:15.140\n that it would affect, it's like a different lens.\n\n54:15.140 --> 54:16.380\n We're all looking at the same thing,\n\n54:16.380 --> 54:19.540\n but I have a different set of sunglasses on than you do.\n\n54:19.540 --> 54:21.980\n And that's very, very interesting.\n\n54:21.980 --> 54:23.340\n I'll use the Quran as an example.\n\n54:23.340 --> 54:25.500\n You know, apparently it's unbelievably poetic\n\n54:25.500 --> 54:27.700\n and in Arabic, still neat\n\n54:27.700 --> 54:29.540\n and was interesting reading in English,\n\n54:29.540 --> 54:32.080\n but I'm told by people that I trust\n\n54:32.080 --> 54:34.180\n that it just one doesn't bear a resemblance to the other.\n\n54:34.180 --> 54:35.800\n And I think that's a very interesting thing\n\n54:35.800 --> 54:37.940\n that you may be able to say the same thing,\n\n54:37.940 --> 54:41.100\n but in a more, I guess, in a different way,\n\n54:41.100 --> 54:43.900\n in a more artistic way that may not translate\n\n54:43.900 --> 54:45.780\n on a one for one kind of fidelity.\n\n54:45.780 --> 54:49.020\n But the more that we're able to understand\n\n54:49.020 --> 54:50.300\n about how the body works,\n\n54:50.300 --> 54:52.200\n the more examples of the body working this way,\n\n54:52.200 --> 54:54.300\n the body working that way, the body working that way,\n\n54:54.300 --> 54:56.340\n the more that I'm able to eventually become an artist,\n\n54:56.340 --> 54:57.980\n but it has to be studied as a science first.\n\n54:57.980 --> 54:59.700\n And it does start with technique collection,\n\n54:59.700 --> 55:02.460\n vocabulary collection, the same way we learn in school.\n\n55:02.460 --> 55:06.780\n You remember how to say quickly 17 different ways.\n\n55:06.780 --> 55:10.420\n And let's say I speak Spanish, I'm only, I only know three.\n\n55:10.420 --> 55:13.340\n So you might use quickly, you might use an adjective\n\n55:13.340 --> 55:15.360\n like quickly in Spanish, but use one of the many,\n\n55:15.360 --> 55:17.500\n many options to describe that, that I don't understand.\n\n55:17.500 --> 55:20.020\n And now I sit there and go like, wait, what?\n\n55:20.020 --> 55:21.220\n I can't be artistic.\n\n55:21.220 --> 55:23.340\n I can't be as organic with the language as I'd like.\n\n55:23.340 --> 55:25.200\n So I believe that jujitsu a lot of times starts\n\n55:25.200 --> 55:28.420\n with the acquisition of a lot of, hey, do this, this,\n\n55:28.420 --> 55:29.540\n this drill, this technique.\n\n55:29.540 --> 55:31.460\n Here's an Americana, Americana to an armlock,\n\n55:31.460 --> 55:33.380\n armlock to a triangle.\n\n55:33.380 --> 55:35.740\n But the problem with that is oftentimes\n\n55:35.740 --> 55:37.700\n we get stuck in that phase.\n\n55:37.700 --> 55:40.740\n And people eventually become move collectors\n\n55:40.740 --> 55:41.740\n or sequence collectors.\n\n55:41.740 --> 55:43.660\n And I noticed this when I'm trying to do DVDs\n\n55:43.660 --> 55:45.660\n or I guess like an instructional series now,\n\n55:45.660 --> 55:47.180\n or even teaching in class,\n\n55:47.180 --> 55:49.660\n I don't believe in that form of learning anymore.\n\n55:49.660 --> 55:52.260\n Not that it's not valuable, but I don't believe,\n\n55:52.260 --> 55:54.000\n I don't understand jujitsu on that level anymore.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.260\n So what I'm trying to do is get across the basic ideas\n\n55:56.260 --> 55:59.220\n to people and say, hey, you need to fill in the gaps\n\n55:59.220 --> 56:01.180\n with going to class all the time.\n\n56:01.180 --> 56:03.220\n You need to go, hey, learn this move, learn that technique,\n\n56:03.220 --> 56:04.060\n learn that technique.\n\n56:04.060 --> 56:05.980\n Because otherwise I'm basically just throwing at you\n\n56:05.980 --> 56:08.500\n like 75 different words that you could use,\n\n56:08.500 --> 56:12.040\n but that hasn't really taught you how to speak a language.\n\n56:12.040 --> 56:14.020\n Whereas if you give me a language structure,\n\n56:14.020 --> 56:16.140\n you can fill in these pieces on your own\n\n56:16.140 --> 56:19.020\n and then eventually speak organically in Lex form,\n\n56:19.020 --> 56:20.820\n which will be ultimately unique to you\n\n56:20.820 --> 56:24.060\n because otherwise you just end up being like a weird facsimile\n\n56:24.060 --> 56:25.700\n of whatever it is that I'm doing\n\n56:25.700 --> 56:29.140\n for mostly the worst I'd say, but.\n\n56:29.140 --> 56:31.180\n Yeah, that's what people, I mean, people comment like,\n\n56:31.180 --> 56:34.640\n is this, especially people who haven't listened to me before,\n\n56:34.640 --> 56:37.140\n is this guy drunk or high?\n\n56:37.140 --> 56:42.140\n Does he, does MIT really allow slow people to be,\n\n56:42.980 --> 56:44.420\n like what's. Quotas.\n\n56:44.420 --> 56:45.540\n Quotas, yeah.\n\n56:45.540 --> 56:47.020\n Like what's wrong with him?\n\n56:47.020 --> 56:48.020\n Is he getting sleep?\n\n56:48.020 --> 56:49.140\n Are you okay?\n\n56:49.140 --> 56:50.420\n Does he need help?\n\n56:50.420 --> 56:52.300\n So that's similar with my jiu jitsu.\n\n56:52.300 --> 56:54.900\n It's like, is this guy, is this guy really,\n\n56:54.900 --> 56:57.180\n whatever rank I was throughout,\n\n56:57.180 --> 57:01.020\n I remember just like, is this guy really this rank?\n\n57:01.020 --> 57:03.520\n I just have a very kind of certain way of sitting\n\n57:03.520 --> 57:06.340\n and being slow and lazy looking\n\n57:06.340 --> 57:08.260\n that there was ultimately the language\n\n57:08.260 --> 57:09.420\n that I had to discover.\n\n57:09.420 --> 57:11.820\n And it was, it was, yeah,\n\n57:11.820 --> 57:13.500\n it was a very liberating moment.\n\n57:13.500 --> 57:18.500\n I think of probably a few years of getting my ass kicked,\n\n57:19.500 --> 57:21.420\n especially with Open Guard and butterfly\n\n57:21.420 --> 57:22.900\n to where you really allow yourself\n\n57:22.900 --> 57:24.980\n to take in the entirety of the language\n\n57:24.980 --> 57:29.140\n and realize that, that I'm not, I'm different.\n\n57:29.140 --> 57:31.900\n I'm a unique, I'm unique.\n\n57:31.900 --> 57:35.300\n And like, I have a very, I have a language,\n\n57:35.300 --> 57:36.700\n I have a set of techniques,\n\n57:36.700 --> 57:39.620\n a way I move my body that needs,\n\n57:39.620 --> 57:41.300\n that I'm the one to discover.\n\n57:41.300 --> 57:43.380\n Like it's, you can only,\n\n57:43.380 --> 57:45.220\n you can learn specific techniques and so on,\n\n57:45.220 --> 57:47.660\n but you really have to understand your own body.\n\n57:47.660 --> 57:49.460\n And that's the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu,\n\n57:49.460 --> 57:54.460\n like you said, is like the connection about your philosophy,\n\n57:54.460 --> 57:57.100\n your view of the world with the physical\n\n57:57.100 --> 57:59.260\n and like connecting those two things,\n\n57:59.260 --> 58:00.940\n how you perceive the world,\n\n58:00.940 --> 58:04.780\n how you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion,\n\n58:04.780 --> 58:07.560\n about force, about effortlessness,\n\n58:07.560 --> 58:09.100\n like what it really means to relax,\n\n58:09.100 --> 58:10.940\n all these kinds of loose concepts,\n\n58:10.940 --> 58:15.940\n and then actually teach your body to like do those things\n\n58:16.460 --> 58:20.020\n and like, you know, and be able to apply force and spurts,\n\n58:20.020 --> 58:21.260\n be able to relax and spurts\n\n58:21.260 --> 58:23.900\n and like figure all that stuff out for my,\n\n58:23.900 --> 58:26.100\n for my individual body.\n\n58:26.100 --> 58:27.340\n But it's, as you mentioned,\n\n58:27.340 --> 58:29.340\n I couldn't agree with you more, it's a discovery process\n\n58:29.340 --> 58:31.240\n and no one can cheat that process,\n\n58:31.240 --> 58:32.460\n which is at the same time,\n\n58:32.460 --> 58:34.260\n it's almost like imagine I wanna start writing books\n\n58:34.260 --> 58:38.020\n in second grade, unless maybe I'm like staggeringly brilliant,\n\n58:38.020 --> 58:40.280\n which I can only conceptualize someone being able to do that,\n\n58:40.280 --> 58:42.360\n but maybe a Mozart of the English language\n\n58:42.360 --> 58:43.760\n where you're out there doing it.\n\n58:43.760 --> 58:45.980\n But for most of us, we don't have enough knowledge,\n\n58:45.980 --> 58:47.500\n enough information, enough experience\n\n58:47.500 --> 58:51.100\n to be able to be, to express ourselves.\n\n58:51.100 --> 58:56.100\n So we have to basically input, repeat, which is important,\n\n58:56.900 --> 58:58.140\n but it's the process, as you say,\n\n58:58.140 --> 58:59.740\n of going through that, of getting your ass kicked,\n\n58:59.740 --> 59:00.860\n of just like, well, that didn't work,\n\n59:00.860 --> 59:02.080\n well, that didn't work, that felt right,\n\n59:02.080 --> 59:03.220\n but I don't know, nobody else does that,\n\n59:03.220 --> 59:04.520\n I guess I don't believe in that,\n\n59:04.520 --> 59:06.580\n versus eventually going, I don't know,\n\n59:06.580 --> 59:08.620\n I'll just try going my own way and see what happens\n\n59:08.620 --> 59:10.440\n and now I'll get yelled at and people won't like me\n\n59:10.440 --> 59:11.820\n and if it works, they'll say I got lucky\n\n59:11.820 --> 59:13.740\n and if it doesn't work, they'll say I was dumb,\n\n59:13.740 --> 59:15.460\n but which one, maybe all is right.\n\n59:15.460 --> 59:17.420\n But basically, you know,\n\n59:17.420 --> 59:19.340\n going through that iterative process\n\n59:19.340 --> 59:21.900\n that allows you to eventually find your self expression\n\n59:21.900 --> 59:24.020\n and find your voice so that you fight\n\n59:24.020 --> 59:25.980\n the same way that you speak, the same way that you write,\n\n59:25.980 --> 59:28.660\n the same way that you think in a way that is uniquely you,\n\n59:28.660 --> 59:31.820\n that will also ultimately allow you\n\n59:31.820 --> 59:33.780\n to understand other people being uniquely them\n\n59:33.780 --> 59:35.660\n because even if you can only conceptualize,\n\n59:35.660 --> 59:37.700\n and I think about this a lot for society stuff,\n\n59:37.700 --> 59:39.700\n where I go, well, this is how I feel about this,\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:41.540\n but am I objectively right?\n\n59:41.540 --> 59:43.700\n Maybe about a couple things, but that's a small box\n\n59:43.700 --> 59:45.060\n that I have to be very, very careful about\n\n59:45.060 --> 59:47.340\n what I think is objective versus what's not\n\n59:47.340 --> 59:48.780\n and I have to be open to the possibility\n\n59:48.780 --> 59:50.900\n of all the things that I think are objectively correct\n\n59:50.900 --> 59:52.100\n may or may not be.\n\n59:52.100 --> 59:54.660\n And that should allow me to have some degree\n\n59:54.660 --> 59:57.020\n of compassion or consideration for other people,\n\n59:57.020 --> 59:58.300\n both in their martial arts journey\n\n59:58.300 --> 1:00:01.820\n and in their journey as people, as human beings,\n\n1:00:01.820 --> 1:00:04.620\n because I understand that they're on a,\n\n1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:07.580\n it's a, we're all on a path where it's all,\n\n1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:10.580\n again, an iterative process of eventual self expression,\n\n1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:11.620\n but I think that's one of the things\n\n1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:15.180\n that we see having trouble when we see tribalism,\n\n1:00:15.180 --> 1:00:17.420\n which, I mean, racism, expression of that,\n\n1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:19.260\n political affiliation, expression of that,\n\n1:00:19.260 --> 1:00:20.500\n all of these things that can go\n\n1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:21.980\n in really uncomfortable directions.\n\n1:00:21.980 --> 1:00:23.380\n People are looking for,\n\n1:00:23.380 --> 1:00:24.740\n hey, where do I plant my feet over here?\n\n1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:26.860\n Where's the thing that I know is right?\n\n1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:29.100\n And we can all agree on the following.\n\n1:00:29.100 --> 1:00:31.180\n And I think that we see that in martial arts.\n\n1:00:31.180 --> 1:00:33.140\n We're like, oh, I do this style, I do that style,\n\n1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:33.980\n I do that style.\n\n1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:35.820\n It's like, hey, man, we're all just pushing forward\n\n1:00:35.820 --> 1:00:37.460\n in a certain direction here, trying to do our best.\n\n1:00:37.460 --> 1:00:38.700\n And I understand why you feel the way you do.\n\n1:00:38.700 --> 1:00:40.660\n I may have felt like that at one point too,\n\n1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:44.300\n but I'm just trying to learn and understand\n\n1:00:44.300 --> 1:00:47.140\n versus I've already acquired enough knowledge,\n\n1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:49.180\n let me cross my arms and start to look\n\n1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:50.700\n who's fucking up around here.\n\n1:00:50.700 --> 1:00:55.060\n And I think that that's an, it's an interesting trap\n\n1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:57.100\n that I think is very human trap to fall into,\n\n1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.660\n but it definitely happens early on.\n\n1:00:58.660 --> 1:01:00.340\n It's, I mean, it's a joke in the jiu jitsu world, right?\n\n1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:02.180\n Like, oh, the blue belt that knows everything.\n\n1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:03.780\n Well, initially it's like, what, I know nothing\n\n1:01:03.780 --> 1:01:05.380\n and I at least think I know nothing.\n\n1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:07.700\n Then I'd learn a little bit and I think it's a lot bit.\n\n1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:09.020\n And then, you know, the more you learn,\n\n1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:11.140\n the more you go like, I don't even know what I'm doing.\n\n1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:13.020\n Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:14.940\n We kind of talked about it a little bit,\n\n1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:18.140\n but once again, a lot of people that listen to this\n\n1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.820\n have never been on the mat, have never tried jiu jitsu,\n\n1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:23.060\n but are really curious about it.\n\n1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:25.740\n Everybody at all positions, like I think, you know,\n\n1:01:25.740 --> 1:01:27.660\n most kids are not doing jiu jitsu.\n\n1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:30.380\n Andrew Yang is like, they're all, you know,\n\n1:01:30.380 --> 1:01:31.620\n the world is curious.\n\n1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:36.020\n It's a, it's a nice, it seems to be a nice methodology\n\n1:01:36.020 --> 1:01:38.060\n by which to humble your ego,\n\n1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:39.980\n which to grow intellectually and physically.\n\n1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:42.140\n So people are curious about it.\n\n1:01:42.140 --> 1:01:44.900\n So the natural question is if they're curious about it,\n\n1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:47.180\n how would you recommend they get started?\n\n1:01:47.180 --> 1:01:51.140\n Maybe like, what do you recommend the first day,\n\n1:01:51.140 --> 1:01:54.540\n week, month, year, first couple of years look like?\n\n1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:56.300\n Like, how do you ease into it\n\n1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:59.020\n and make sure that it's a positive experience\n\n1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:03.460\n and you progress in the most optimal and positive way?\n\n1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:07.020\n The first thing you can do is simply ask yourself why,\n\n1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:08.220\n why you want to be involved.\n\n1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:10.160\n You know, I remember the first day that I walked into\n\n1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:12.260\n Ronin Athletics in New York City\n\n1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:14.640\n to train under Godfather of my son now,\n\n1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:18.020\n Christian Montes, and I didn't know\n\n1:02:18.020 --> 1:02:19.220\n what I was getting myself into.\n\n1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:21.120\n I played baseball through high school\n\n1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:24.620\n and I wanted, I was at Manhattan College in the Bronx\n\n1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:27.340\n and I wanted to go and learn martial arts\n\n1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:29.540\n because it was always something that was interesting to me,\n\n1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:33.080\n but it was never something that I knew was accessible\n\n1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:34.900\n and it definitely wasn't really around\n\n1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:36.740\n in Northern Virginia where I grew up,\n\n1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:38.800\n whereas then you stick yourself in Manhattan\n\n1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:40.080\n and there's stuff everywhere.\n\n1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:43.260\n So anyway, I guess I didn't know what to expect.\n\n1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.180\n I didn't know if I was going to get beat up,\n\n1:02:45.180 --> 1:02:46.180\n if people were going to be nice,\n\n1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:48.300\n if people were not going to be nice,\n\n1:02:48.300 --> 1:02:52.940\n but what I began with was, I think, expectation management.\n\n1:02:52.940 --> 1:02:56.860\n And I think that that's something that I would,\n\n1:02:56.860 --> 1:02:58.500\n that'd be the first thing that I would start\n\n1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.580\n is almost imagining what is it that I'm getting myself into\n\n1:03:01.580 --> 1:03:03.860\n because I love the martial arts.\n\n1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:05.440\n The martial arts has given me everything in life\n\n1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:08.380\n and I'm so thankful I wouldn't be sitting here\n\n1:03:08.380 --> 1:03:11.220\n without that experience, that journey.\n\n1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:12.900\n The people that I've met, the places that I've gone,\n\n1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:15.320\n I could never, ever have ever imagined.\n\n1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:19.020\n And I'm just unbelievably thankful for that.\n\n1:03:19.020 --> 1:03:24.020\n But I think that the thing that helped me most of all\n\n1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:26.540\n was starting with going,\n\n1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:29.300\n my mom said something to me one time and she said,\n\n1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:31.700\n there's two types of people in various situations.\n\n1:03:31.700 --> 1:03:33.440\n There's why and there's why not.\n\n1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:36.100\n And it's understandable to have questions, concerns,\n\n1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:37.660\n things like that.\n\n1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:39.380\n But maybe sometimes it's a little bit easier\n\n1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:41.960\n when you're younger to just trust people\n\n1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:44.140\n or just say, I don't know, you know.\n\n1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:46.620\n But we go, hey, you wanna climb that rock?\n\n1:03:46.620 --> 1:03:47.440\n I'm like, yeah, why not?\n\n1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:48.280\n Let's go.\n\n1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:49.120\n Hey, you wanna jump in that river?\n\n1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:49.960\n Yeah, why not?\n\n1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:50.780\n Sure.\n\n1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:53.180\n Versus if I have to reason my way into everything,\n\n1:03:53.180 --> 1:03:55.060\n if I have to be talked into everything,\n\n1:03:55.060 --> 1:03:56.740\n a lot of times I'll talk myself out of it.\n\n1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:57.780\n And I think that a lot of times\n\n1:03:57.780 --> 1:03:59.740\n this is the thinker's disease.\n\n1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:01.480\n You wanna figure out what's gonna happen\n\n1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:03.660\n and what you should expect to have happen\n\n1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:06.460\n before you get involved versus going,\n\n1:04:06.460 --> 1:04:08.060\n using the old Bruce Lee saying again,\n\n1:04:08.060 --> 1:04:09.700\n it's like no amount of thinking or training\n\n1:04:09.700 --> 1:04:12.300\n on the side of the river will teach you how to swim.\n\n1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:13.620\n You have to jump in.\n\n1:04:13.620 --> 1:04:15.400\n And there are risks associated with that.\n\n1:04:15.400 --> 1:04:19.620\n And I guess psychological are usually the biggest ones.\n\n1:04:19.620 --> 1:04:20.700\n That's the biggest hurdle.\n\n1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:21.620\n And physical.\n\n1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:25.160\n But the biggest thing that I guess I would suggest\n\n1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:26.540\n to anyone to say, well, why do you wanna do this?\n\n1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:28.180\n You're like, well, I wanna challenge myself.\n\n1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:30.280\n I wanna learn, I would like to learn to fight.\n\n1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:32.440\n I wanted to learn to fight so that I could protect myself.\n\n1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:33.940\n And if anything else, other people,\n\n1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:35.420\n if only within arms reach.\n\n1:04:35.420 --> 1:04:39.980\n I perceived that if I had some small degree of power,\n\n1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:41.460\n I generally wouldn't use it.\n\n1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:42.860\n Which is why I was like, yeah, I'll give it a try.\n\n1:04:42.860 --> 1:04:43.840\n I'll try to be reasonable.\n\n1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:45.180\n And hopefully if I make a mistake,\n\n1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:46.180\n I'll apologize to people.\n\n1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:49.120\n But basically I said, yeah, I'd like to have that.\n\n1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.180\n And I wanna, I know this is gonna be challenging\n\n1:04:52.180 --> 1:04:54.100\n and we'll see what happens.\n\n1:04:54.100 --> 1:04:55.620\n And that means that getting beat up\n\n1:04:55.620 --> 1:04:57.780\n and I didn't get like hurt, but getting roughed up,\n\n1:04:57.780 --> 1:05:00.520\n getting my arm bent this way or that way, getting choked.\n\n1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:01.820\n I was like, well, this is all supposed to happen.\n\n1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:02.940\n That's no big deal.\n\n1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:04.740\n It would be like going and joining the army\n\n1:05:04.740 --> 1:05:06.900\n during peacetime and then going,\n\n1:05:06.900 --> 1:05:08.580\n oh, I'm just doing this for college education.\n\n1:05:08.580 --> 1:05:09.820\n You know, like, okay, that's cool, man.\n\n1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:11.560\n And then all of a sudden war breaks out\n\n1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:12.500\n and they wanna send me somewhere.\n\n1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:13.580\n And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:15.020\n I didn't sign up for that.\n\n1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:17.380\n Actually you did, whether you realize it or not.\n\n1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:19.820\n You may not have thought that you did, but you did.\n\n1:05:19.820 --> 1:05:22.880\n So getting your mind right and just going,\n\n1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:24.580\n what are my expectations for this activity?\n\n1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:25.940\n What is it that I'm looking to do?\n\n1:05:25.940 --> 1:05:28.660\n And of course, you know, you're going into a gym,\n\n1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:30.460\n you're going into a place that you don't know people,\n\n1:05:30.460 --> 1:05:31.660\n you probably don't know people\n\n1:05:31.660 --> 1:05:32.580\n and you don't know the coach.\n\n1:05:32.580 --> 1:05:34.100\n And even if you do wanna, hey, how you doing?\n\n1:05:34.100 --> 1:05:35.660\n Shake your hand, type of level.\n\n1:05:35.660 --> 1:05:38.180\n You know, 95% of my students don't know me.\n\n1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:39.540\n Not really, you know, I'll try to be polite\n\n1:05:39.540 --> 1:05:40.580\n and not annoy them too much,\n\n1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:43.100\n but they don't know me and I don't know them.\n\n1:05:43.100 --> 1:05:45.260\n I understand if they don't trust me,\n\n1:05:45.260 --> 1:05:48.140\n I wouldn't trust, trust me either if I were them.\n\n1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:50.820\n But at the same time, someone has to take that leap.\n\n1:05:50.820 --> 1:05:52.680\n And one of the things that I've noticed\n\n1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:53.820\n as a martial arts instructor,\n\n1:05:53.820 --> 1:05:56.940\n that's the biggest struggle with dealing with adults,\n\n1:05:56.940 --> 1:05:58.660\n which is why a lot of people like to teach kids\n\n1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:01.020\n is because kids don't ask, don't argue.\n\n1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:04.060\n Now that also means there's all sorts of pitfalls\n\n1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:05.860\n or that sort of thing, and that can be an issue.\n\n1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:08.300\n But you know, I guess a lot of times people get to a point\n\n1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.660\n in their life, you know, in their 20s, early 30s,\n\n1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:13.380\n where now I'm a manager now, I know what I'm doing.\n\n1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:14.860\n No one talks to me like that.\n\n1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:16.460\n First it's like, hey man, you go join bootcamp,\n\n1:06:16.460 --> 1:06:17.660\n I don't care if you are Elon Musk,\n\n1:06:17.660 --> 1:06:19.300\n they're gonna tell you to shut up and do pushups.\n\n1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:21.300\n And that's what's great about it.\n\n1:06:21.300 --> 1:06:24.860\n So you are taking a leap of faith into a world\n\n1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:26.460\n that you're gonna be a tiny fish.\n\n1:06:26.460 --> 1:06:30.100\n And you gotta hope that the people who are guiding you\n\n1:06:30.100 --> 1:06:32.620\n in that journey are gonna have,\n\n1:06:32.620 --> 1:06:34.500\n I can't even say your best interests at heart\n\n1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:35.460\n because they don't even know you,\n\n1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:36.860\n but they'll try to do no harm.\n\n1:06:36.860 --> 1:06:37.700\n And they'll try to help you\n\n1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:39.140\n in the way that they would understand.\n\n1:06:39.140 --> 1:06:40.540\n And I guess that's, for instance,\n\n1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:42.620\n that's what I would try to do with anyone\n\n1:06:42.620 --> 1:06:44.340\n that comes into my gym.\n\n1:06:44.340 --> 1:06:45.700\n I would try to help them in the way\n\n1:06:45.700 --> 1:06:48.660\n that I understand they need as best I can\n\n1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:51.400\n and as safe and reasonable a way as possible,\n\n1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:53.220\n but sometimes in a way that's gonna make them uncomfortable,\n\n1:06:53.220 --> 1:06:55.220\n particularly if physical combat,\n\n1:06:55.220 --> 1:06:58.240\n and it's not something they've done before.\n\n1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:00.900\n If a lot of people go in without even having played,\n\n1:07:00.900 --> 1:07:03.660\n you know, contact sports, and so that can be a big jump.\n\n1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:04.740\n And you have to understand,\n\n1:07:04.740 --> 1:07:07.220\n if that's where you're starting from, no worries,\n\n1:07:07.220 --> 1:07:09.260\n but you're gonna have to kind of work your way to it,\n\n1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:12.220\n and it's gonna be uncomfortable, and that's okay.\n\n1:07:12.220 --> 1:07:13.200\n It's part of the process,\n\n1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:14.820\n and you're gonna have some bumps and bruises,\n\n1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:16.660\n and you're not gonna wanna roll with that guy in the corner\n\n1:07:16.660 --> 1:07:18.660\n because that person's rough, and they beat you up,\n\n1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:20.580\n and they're like, okay, but is this a big hurt\n\n1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:21.820\n or is it a little hurt?\n\n1:07:21.820 --> 1:07:23.300\n If it's a big hurt, okay.\n\n1:07:23.300 --> 1:07:24.340\n If it's a little hurt,\n\n1:07:25.300 --> 1:07:27.300\n need you to center up a little bit.\n\n1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:30.380\n It's such an interesting balance because to find,\n\n1:07:30.380 --> 1:07:32.500\n I think one of the most important things\n\n1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:34.660\n as in anything, I think, in life\n\n1:07:34.660 --> 1:07:39.440\n is the selection of the people that you put around you.\n\n1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:42.020\n I mean, that's true with like getting married.\n\n1:07:42.020 --> 1:07:44.620\n That's true with like if you go to,\n\n1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:46.620\n if people ask me, like graduate students,\n\n1:07:46.620 --> 1:07:51.620\n like your PhD advisor can be the difference.\n\n1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:52.740\n It's everything.\n\n1:07:52.740 --> 1:07:55.300\n It's like you spend five years with somebody,\n\n1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:59.040\n they're going to basically define more impact on you\n\n1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:01.500\n than anybody you marry, anybody you hang out with.\n\n1:08:01.500 --> 1:08:02.420\n It's a huge impact.\n\n1:08:02.420 --> 1:08:05.260\n And the same with the coach selection,\n\n1:08:05.260 --> 1:08:08.940\n which is like the school selection,\n\n1:08:08.940 --> 1:08:11.660\n is it's going to be really important about\n\n1:08:11.660 --> 1:08:16.660\n in terms of like who you select will define how happy,\n\n1:08:16.820 --> 1:08:18.980\n like the trajectory of your growth\n\n1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.140\n and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience.\n\n1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:26.140\n And yet, like the flip side of that is,\n\n1:08:26.340 --> 1:08:28.420\n especially if you have an ego,\n\n1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:29.900\n especially if you are the manager\n\n1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:31.300\n that needs to let go of some stuff,\n\n1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:33.380\n you're going to feel like shit\n\n1:08:33.380 --> 1:08:35.820\n with the best kind of coach.\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.540\n That's what you need.\n\n1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:40.540\n But there's a weird balance there to find.\n\n1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:43.480\n Like, I mean, like, and everybody needs a different thing.\n\n1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:48.480\n Like I'm much more, I enjoy being sort of like,\n\n1:08:48.540 --> 1:08:51.440\n it sounds weird, but like I'm, you know,\n\n1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:53.300\n from the wrestling background,\n\n1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:58.040\n I enjoy feeling like crap in the sense like the coach,\n\n1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:00.220\n like getting beat up.\n\n1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:01.580\n I don't actually enjoy it.\n\n1:09:01.580 --> 1:09:03.740\n It's not like some masochistic thing or whatever.\n\n1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:06.560\n It's like, it's the growth.\n\n1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:08.220\n Like I like the anxiety.\n\n1:09:08.220 --> 1:09:12.820\n I like feeling like shit when I go home,\n\n1:09:12.820 --> 1:09:17.380\n like emotionally, physically, it's like, it's growth.\n\n1:09:17.380 --> 1:09:18.420\n It's a sign of growth, right?\n\n1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:20.240\n Like if you're not having to feel those things,\n\n1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:22.580\n you're probably in your comfort zone, which is fine,\n\n1:09:22.580 --> 1:09:24.820\n but that's not your growth zone, right?\n\n1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:27.780\n And everybody has a different threshold for that.\n\n1:09:27.780 --> 1:09:31.700\n And I mean, the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like,\n\n1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:34.460\n it's also has like a yoga feel to it.\n\n1:09:34.460 --> 1:09:36.420\n Like you're learning about your body.\n\n1:09:36.420 --> 1:09:40.000\n So depending on the gym and depending on, in fact,\n\n1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.300\n the coaches or the people around you within the gym,\n\n1:09:42.300 --> 1:09:45.500\n you can select little groups too, kind of like the people\n\n1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:48.380\n with who you roll, like if you're a smaller person,\n\n1:09:48.380 --> 1:09:50.100\n it doesn't mean you have to go against big people.\n\n1:09:50.100 --> 1:09:53.300\n You can go against the people who like smoke a lot of weed\n\n1:09:53.300 --> 1:09:56.020\n and they're chill, or you can go against like that crazy\n\n1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:59.460\n red blue belt competitor who's like out to destroy everybody.\n\n1:09:59.460 --> 1:10:02.380\n And depending on like what your mindset is,\n\n1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:03.860\n you can kind of select that.\n\n1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:07.820\n It's such a fascinating journey of like,\n\n1:10:07.820 --> 1:10:09.620\n basically self discovery.\n\n1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:10.700\n I couldn't agree with you more.\n\n1:10:10.700 --> 1:10:12.900\n It's, I mean, what you need may change over time, right?\n\n1:10:12.900 --> 1:10:14.980\n Maybe what you needed, what you need today\n\n1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:16.700\n could change six months from now or a year from now.\n\n1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:18.420\n And that's something that I experienced.\n\n1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:20.480\n I'll use my first coach Christian, again,\n\n1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:22.960\n as a great example of someone who I really look up to\n\n1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:25.300\n and respect and someone who helped me a lot.\n\n1:10:25.300 --> 1:10:27.500\n Like at a time when I really needed some guidance\n\n1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:30.180\n and I needed to learn martial arts, but get into,\n\n1:10:30.180 --> 1:10:32.000\n Hensel Gracie's gym was right down the street\n\n1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.620\n from where Christian was teaching.\n\n1:10:33.620 --> 1:10:35.140\n And Christian was a blue belt at the time.\n\n1:10:35.140 --> 1:10:37.060\n It was, he was teaching at a place called Fight House,\n\n1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:40.380\n which was this awesome, like, you know, like 90s,\n\n1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:44.180\n early 2000s, you know, warehouse area down\n\n1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:47.020\n on Fashion Avenue in Manhattan,\n\n1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:48.340\n off of like between 7th and 8th.\n\n1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:50.980\n And it was like two basketball courts wide,\n\n1:10:50.980 --> 1:10:52.500\n but like there was the Sambo guys over here.\n\n1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:53.660\n There was the Kali guys over there.\n\n1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:54.500\n There was a Wing Chun over there.\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:55.620\n There was Jiu Jitsu in the corner.\n\n1:10:55.620 --> 1:10:58.060\n And Hensel's was one of the most famous academies\n\n1:10:58.060 --> 1:10:59.700\n in the world at that time, still is.\n\n1:10:59.700 --> 1:11:02.260\n And I just didn't know what Hensel Gracie was.\n\n1:11:02.260 --> 1:11:04.020\n And I mean, it's a great gym\n\n1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:06.140\n and it's a fantastic place for people to train.\n\n1:11:06.140 --> 1:11:08.820\n But I think what was right for me at the time was to,\n\n1:11:08.820 --> 1:11:12.580\n I stumbled into, you know, like a two person elevator up\n\n1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:15.460\n and found a place where six people trained at that time.\n\n1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:18.780\n And I had someone that could give me some,\n\n1:11:18.780 --> 1:11:20.460\n like in addition to martial arts advice,\n\n1:11:20.460 --> 1:11:22.020\n like personal guidance.\n\n1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:23.600\n And that made a big difference.\n\n1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.300\n And then when initially we would have like competitions\n\n1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:29.420\n or like intra, you know, gym competitions\n\n1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:30.660\n with the Sambo guys, we would compete,\n\n1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:31.820\n we would roll with them.\n\n1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:33.100\n And like, again, it was great\n\n1:11:33.100 --> 1:11:34.960\n because they were just a bunch of like Russian dudes\n\n1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:35.900\n from like Brighton Beach.\n\n1:11:35.900 --> 1:11:38.380\n And they would come down and then we would all fight.\n\n1:11:38.380 --> 1:11:39.280\n And then everyone would train\n\n1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:41.060\n and we'd all drink tea and then go home.\n\n1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:45.940\n And anyway, what was, it was super tough.\n\n1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:47.800\n And they were like, again, just a tough group of people.\n\n1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:48.640\n It was great.\n\n1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:51.340\n And then I remember when I decided\n\n1:11:51.340 --> 1:11:52.380\n after like four or five months,\n\n1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:54.140\n I'm like, man, I really want to try to take this seriously.\n\n1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:55.100\n And I told Christian about that.\n\n1:11:55.100 --> 1:11:55.940\n And he's like, well, hey,\n\n1:11:55.940 --> 1:11:56.820\n I think you need to do the following.\n\n1:11:56.820 --> 1:11:58.700\n And it was, you know, like, hey, here's,\n\n1:11:58.700 --> 1:11:59.940\n there was a guy named Jeff Ruth,\n\n1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.420\n who was a purple belt at the time,\n\n1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:03.000\n which was a much bigger deal than it is now,\n\n1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.660\n but it was 10 and always an MMA fighter,\n\n1:12:04.660 --> 1:12:06.720\n a lot of amateur box spirit, super tough dude.\n\n1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:09.380\n And Jeff was the best person at that time\n\n1:12:09.380 --> 1:12:10.220\n that I'd ever trained with.\n\n1:12:10.220 --> 1:12:11.260\n And I just got squashed.\n\n1:12:11.260 --> 1:12:12.140\n Christian used to beat me up too,\n\n1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:15.060\n but like Jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me.\n\n1:12:15.060 --> 1:12:16.600\n And I was like, this is awesome.\n\n1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:18.140\n And this was back when I was at home.\n\n1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:19.380\n I went home for the summer for that.\n\n1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:22.620\n And Chris is like, hey, I think you should stay because I told him that's what I was thinking.\n\n1:12:22.620 --> 1:12:27.580\n And this was a coach that, you know, when it's like when initially was exactly what I needed.\n\n1:12:27.580 --> 1:12:29.460\n And then he's like, well, hey, that's not what I'm doing here.\n\n1:12:29.460 --> 1:12:32.400\n Maybe they're going to be able to help you onto a path that's,\n\n1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:34.820\n that's kind of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment.\n\n1:12:34.820 --> 1:12:37.520\n And then, you know, that was an, that was an interesting thing.\n\n1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:43.820\n And I really got, I feel that I was fortunate to start at a place where my coach was able to transition roles\n\n1:12:43.820 --> 1:12:46.260\n and, and, and do so comfortably.\n\n1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:49.360\n And I think that that also was probably a factor of the fact that, you know,\n\n1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:53.960\n where he'd done some of his training prior, like there've been issues with, with the coach there.\n\n1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.340\n We're like not supporting, not having the support, you know, feeling like, hey,\n\n1:12:57.340 --> 1:12:58.580\n like I'm going to hold onto my students.\n\n1:12:58.580 --> 1:13:03.460\n I'm gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl, even if I can't take them where they need to go.\n\n1:13:03.460 --> 1:13:05.300\n So that was an interesting thing.\n\n1:13:05.300 --> 1:13:10.740\n And just recognizing also though, that the people like the same way you're an individual going into a gym\n\n1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:13.420\n and you don't know what you're getting into your coach is a person too.\n\n1:13:13.420 --> 1:13:18.140\n And he or she, you know, they may have been doing this activity longer than you, but they're not,\n\n1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:20.940\n they're not some weird little, you know, all knowing God.\n\n1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:22.180\n They don't know anything.\n\n1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:23.780\n They may say something that pisses you off.\n\n1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:25.820\n They may, they may yell at you.\n\n1:13:25.820 --> 1:13:26.580\n They may help you.\n\n1:13:26.580 --> 1:13:31.060\n They may inadvertently cause you some sort of, you know, some sort of issue.\n\n1:13:31.060 --> 1:13:35.700\n And just being able to recognize that even though I say this to people and I've said this to people in my gym,\n\n1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:38.900\n I'm like, you know, we're in the service industry, man, but I'm not at your service.\n\n1:13:38.900 --> 1:13:39.980\n Like don't get it twisted.\n\n1:13:39.980 --> 1:13:42.620\n Like I will absolutely do my best to help people.\n\n1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:48.100\n I'm there to do my best as a martial arts coach, but I'm here to do my best as a martial arts coach.\n\n1:13:48.100 --> 1:13:51.020\n And I'll do my best and periodically I make mistakes and I own apology or two,\n\n1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:52.780\n and I'll try to give them out when I can.\n\n1:13:52.780 --> 1:13:54.020\n But we're not McDonald's.\n\n1:13:54.020 --> 1:13:56.420\n It's not, oh, you gave me a hundred bucks, so you do whatever you want in here.\n\n1:13:56.420 --> 1:13:57.100\n This is my house.\n\n1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:57.780\n This is my gym.\n\n1:13:57.780 --> 1:13:58.460\n This is my dojo.\n\n1:13:58.460 --> 1:13:59.580\n This is, this is a martial arts.\n\n1:13:59.580 --> 1:14:00.820\n This is not a basketball team.\n\n1:14:00.820 --> 1:14:01.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:03.420\n There's something beautiful about martial arts.\n\n1:14:03.420 --> 1:14:08.420\n Like exactly as you said is the coach, like in wrestling and at least collegiate,\n\n1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:16.900\n like high level wrestling is like, there's a dictatorship aspect to a coach that is very important to have.\n\n1:14:16.900 --> 1:14:23.060\n Like this, this ridiculous sometimes nature of like master and so on and bowing, all these traditions.\n\n1:14:23.060 --> 1:14:26.580\n There's something, it seems ridiculous from the outside perhaps,\n\n1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:30.980\n but there's something really powerful to that because that process of you said, why not,\n\n1:14:30.980 --> 1:14:37.700\n of letting go of the leap of faith requires you to believe that the coach has your best interest in mind\n\n1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:44.420\n and just give yourself over to their ideas of how, how you should grow.\n\n1:14:44.420 --> 1:14:45.660\n And that's an interesting thing.\n\n1:14:45.660 --> 1:14:52.620\n I mean, I've never been able to really see coaches I've had as human.\n\n1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:57.060\n They're always, you always, it's like a father figure or like this,\n\n1:14:57.060 --> 1:14:59.180\n you always put them in this position of power.\n\n1:14:59.180 --> 1:15:04.220\n And I think that's, I think at least for me, it's been a very,\n\n1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:09.940\n it's been a very useful way to see the coach because it allows you to not think and let go\n\n1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:14.500\n and really allow yourself to grow and emotionally deal with all the beatings.\n\n1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:18.260\n Well, they'll push you where past oftentimes where you would have stopped yourself, right?\n\n1:15:18.260 --> 1:15:18.900\n Which is great.\n\n1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:22.260\n And then hopefully they know they, if they're paying attention and they're,\n\n1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:23.860\n they're still a person, they can make mistakes,\n\n1:15:23.860 --> 1:15:27.860\n but they'll push you further than you would have gone, but not so far that it's not facilitative.\n\n1:15:27.860 --> 1:15:28.500\n Right.\n\n1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:32.340\n That's something that I can say, like Faraz Zahabi, the head coach at TriStar,\n\n1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:35.220\n my head coach for MMA, Kenny Florian, one of the head coaches for MMA,\n\n1:15:35.220 --> 1:15:37.140\n they've both been phenomenal influences.\n\n1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:40.420\n Paul Shriner, who's the one of the assistants at Marcelo Garcia's Academy,\n\n1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:44.020\n coached me in Jiu Jitsu for a long time, brilliant instructor.\n\n1:15:44.020 --> 1:15:45.300\n They've all been able to do that.\n\n1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:48.100\n And I think what's interesting about all of those guys is they're very sharp,\n\n1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:50.100\n but they're very intuitive as well.\n\n1:15:50.100 --> 1:15:54.500\n And I think that Faraz actually, you know, told me about some of the John Wooden said,\n\n1:15:54.500 --> 1:15:59.460\n John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, just a simple philosophical idea.\n\n1:15:59.460 --> 1:16:02.500\n Just, he said, some people's life is a bowl of shit.\n\n1:16:03.060 --> 1:16:04.660\n It needs some whipped cream in it.\n\n1:16:04.660 --> 1:16:06.740\n Some people's life is a bowl of whipped cream.\n\n1:16:06.740 --> 1:16:08.740\n Needs a little bit of shit in it just to balance it out.\n\n1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:09.860\n And it's an interesting thing.\n\n1:16:09.860 --> 1:16:12.580\n Coaching everyone the same way doesn't work.\n\n1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:14.900\n You know, that's, I think the difference between a coach and an instructor.\n\n1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:17.780\n And a lot of times people think they want to coach, but they really want an instructor.\n\n1:16:17.780 --> 1:16:20.580\n I'm like, hey Lex, tell me what to do, not how to do it.\n\n1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:25.060\n And then other times people think they want, you know, an instructor and they really want a coach.\n\n1:16:25.060 --> 1:16:27.060\n I'm like, man, this guy's just giving me information.\n\n1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:28.820\n A coach is so much more than an instructor.\n\n1:16:28.820 --> 1:16:30.020\n And that's a huge leap.\n\n1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:33.060\n And that's something that I think that people need to understand when they're going into\n\n1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:33.460\n martial arts.\n\n1:16:33.460 --> 1:16:36.900\n And I understand, and I can totally grasp why they don't, because how would they know?\n\n1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:41.860\n But I think about this a lot, like me giving you $150 for a month, which is not nothing,\n\n1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:42.420\n that's for sure.\n\n1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:45.140\n That does not, that pays for instructor really.\n\n1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:48.740\n Coach is a relationship that gets developed because can you imagine like just the amount\n\n1:16:48.740 --> 1:16:53.220\n of emotional investment and time thinking away from like, oh, Lex isn't here anymore.\n\n1:16:53.220 --> 1:16:54.020\n What can I do to help him?\n\n1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:55.060\n What does he need?\n\n1:16:55.060 --> 1:16:56.260\n Like that's serious.\n\n1:16:56.260 --> 1:17:01.780\n And that's the difference between, that's oftentimes the difference that getting over\n\n1:17:01.780 --> 1:17:03.700\n the hump in various situations.\n\n1:17:03.700 --> 1:17:08.660\n So it's an interesting, you know, bargain that's being made like commitment by the instructor\n\n1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:10.980\n who becomes a coach, commitment by the student.\n\n1:17:10.980 --> 1:17:12.660\n You know, like there's a financial transaction.\n\n1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:16.820\n There's a lot of things going on there, but I feel very fortunate to have had not just\n\n1:17:16.820 --> 1:17:18.420\n instructors in my time, but coaches.\n\n1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:22.260\n And that means sometimes we butted heads and sometimes I look back and I think I was right.\n\n1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:24.660\n And other times I look back on my own, no, they were definitely right.\n\n1:17:24.660 --> 1:17:29.620\n But there was always the trust with the exception of one time that I feel that trust was greatly\n\n1:17:29.620 --> 1:17:35.940\n betrayed that rightly or wrongly, whether mistakes, mistakes will be made, but everyone\n\n1:17:35.940 --> 1:17:39.460\n is attempting to do the right thing under no circumstances.\n\n1:17:39.460 --> 1:17:43.540\n Is what I intentionally do anything malicious, you know, versus, Hey, I might've done.\n\n1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:46.500\n I might've burnt your house down, but you can be darn sure it wasn't on purpose.\n\n1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:51.060\n And I think that as long as there's that mutual understanding and mutual belief of goodwill,\n\n1:17:51.060 --> 1:17:53.140\n which again, doesn't just magic up out of nowhere.\n\n1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:54.180\n I understand.\n\n1:17:54.180 --> 1:17:56.340\n I think that that's when then great things can happen.\n\n1:17:56.340 --> 1:17:59.780\n And I look at all the athletes that I know, you know, the guys and girls that I've watched\n\n1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:03.380\n become fantastic in various places, almost invariably.\n\n1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:04.340\n It never happened alone.\n\n1:18:05.140 --> 1:18:05.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:05.540 --> 1:18:05.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:05.940 --> 1:18:07.380\n I'm really torn about that.\n\n1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:09.540\n Like, maybe you can help.\n\n1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:10.980\n Have you seen the movie Whiplash?\n\n1:18:12.180 --> 1:18:17.460\n So it's, I would say from an outsider's perspective, people should watch it.\n\n1:18:17.460 --> 1:18:20.180\n It's, I guess, jazz band.\n\n1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:23.860\n It's a movie about a drummer and the instructor.\n\n1:18:23.860 --> 1:18:29.060\n And he, it's a basically, I would say from the outsider's perspective, it's a toxic\n\n1:18:29.060 --> 1:18:36.340\n relationship, but he's really the coach, whatever we call him, pushes the musician, the drummer\n\n1:18:36.340 --> 1:18:43.460\n or to his limits, like to where he just feels like shit emotionally.\n\n1:18:43.460 --> 1:18:49.060\n It's a, it looks like a toxic relationship, but it's one that ultimately is very productive\n\n1:18:49.060 --> 1:18:52.500\n for the improvement of the musician.\n\n1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:59.060\n I have the same, like in my own experience, I had, I got a chance to train at a couple\n\n1:18:59.060 --> 1:19:00.500\n of places regularly.\n\n1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:06.820\n And so one of my coaches who is a great human being, a lot of people love him.\n\n1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:10.900\n But when I was a blue belt, he was pushing me a lot for competition.\n\n1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:21.060\n And every time I step on the mat, I was anxious and almost afraid of training because of like\n\n1:19:21.060 --> 1:19:22.420\n the places I'm going to have to go.\n\n1:19:22.420 --> 1:19:30.420\n And then the, I can't, I don't know what's good or bad because I think I've become a\n\n1:19:30.420 --> 1:19:32.820\n better person because of that experience.\n\n1:19:32.820 --> 1:19:33.860\n Like I needed that.\n\n1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:40.420\n And on the flip side, like the place I got my black belt from, it's Balanced Studios.\n\n1:19:40.420 --> 1:19:46.820\n I remember also blue belt, the coach sitting down and I was going to competition and he\n\n1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:56.820\n saw something in me where he said, you know, like, good luck, but win or lose, we always\n\n1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:57.380\n love you.\n\n1:19:58.260 --> 1:20:02.980\n Like, I, I really, I remember that because I really needed that at that time.\n\n1:20:02.980 --> 1:20:05.220\n Like I was putting so much pressure on myself.\n\n1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:10.580\n Like I'm not an actual professional competitor, you know, I just competed.\n\n1:20:10.580 --> 1:20:15.220\n Like I'm a PhD student, like, but like it was clearly having a psychological effect\n\n1:20:15.220 --> 1:20:21.380\n on me and that's what a great coach does is like, you know, it's like life is more\n\n1:20:21.380 --> 1:20:23.700\n important than Jiu Jitsu since it's bigger.\n\n1:20:23.700 --> 1:20:30.580\n So they find, you use Jiu Jitsu when you need it to grow as a person and when it\n\n1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:34.980\n overwhelms you, you have to pull that person out, like look at the bigger picture, always\n\n1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:38.820\n look at the bigger picture and it's fascinating and I don't know what to make of it.\n\n1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:44.260\n I don't think I would have it any other way is both the anxiety and the, and the love\n\n1:20:44.260 --> 1:20:45.540\n and the love.\n\n1:20:45.540 --> 1:20:46.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:49.380\n I think that I couldn't, that's a really interesting thing that you're describing\n\n1:20:49.380 --> 1:20:52.980\n that I guess it kind of brings me back to a lot of the other things we've been\n\n1:20:52.980 --> 1:20:58.180\n discussing is just almost like the, the reciprocal nature of everything where no\n\n1:20:58.180 --> 1:20:59.620\n pressure, that's great.\n\n1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:01.460\n Everyone's happy all the time.\n\n1:21:01.460 --> 1:21:05.300\n It's either, I mean, let's, uh, use the example of sci fi movies to see the matrix,\n\n1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:08.260\n which of course the first one was amazing and then each subsequent movie made the\n\n1:21:08.260 --> 1:21:09.220\n series worse.\n\n1:21:09.220 --> 1:21:14.580\n But, um, but basically, yeah, I've heard, we'll see, I was hoping for the best, but,\n\n1:21:14.580 --> 1:21:17.780\n um, but basically, uh, you know, let's say, Hey, which we started with our first\n\n1:21:17.780 --> 1:21:22.820\n initial world agent Smith says to Neo is like our first world was a utopia where\n\n1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:24.660\n everyone was happy and nothing ever went wrong.\n\n1:21:24.660 --> 1:21:27.380\n It's like your primitive cerebrum rejected it.\n\n1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:31.380\n And I think that there's obviously, I mean, what do I think, but I guess, well,\n\n1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:33.060\n I'm here, so I might as well say what I think.\n\n1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:39.460\n Um, I guess, uh, you know, great things are fantastic.\n\n1:21:39.460 --> 1:21:42.180\n A kind, gentle place is fantastic.\n\n1:21:42.180 --> 1:21:45.700\n And this is again, why I love dune is I think dune does such a great job of, of\n\n1:21:45.700 --> 1:21:48.580\n expressing Frank Herbert does such a great job of expressing again, the\n\n1:21:48.580 --> 1:21:50.260\n reciprocal nature of these ideas.\n\n1:21:50.260 --> 1:21:53.860\n You know, look at, uh, look at Sparta for instance, or at least what I understand\n\n1:21:53.860 --> 1:21:56.580\n of Sparta from the reading and also watching 300.\n\n1:21:56.580 --> 1:22:00.820\n Um, uh, you know, and reading the Wikipedia and reading the Wikipedia\n\n1:22:00.820 --> 1:22:02.980\n article about the movie, not the place.\n\n1:22:02.980 --> 1:22:07.620\n Um, but, uh, it's, um, that's a hard, brutal place.\n\n1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:10.420\n And that was their benefit to that.\n\n1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:11.540\n Like, absolutely.\n\n1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:12.980\n Was there drawback to that?\n\n1:22:12.980 --> 1:22:13.780\n Absolutely.\n\n1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:14.740\n Is it sustainable?\n\n1:22:14.740 --> 1:22:17.300\n I should probably think probably not.\n\n1:22:17.300 --> 1:22:21.380\n Um, I mean, granted it hasn't sustained, but I mean, that type of a, of a thing,\n\n1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:22.980\n it, it burns too hot almost.\n\n1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:26.820\n And it, uh, it, it destroys the host at a certain point.\n\n1:22:26.820 --> 1:22:30.660\n And, you know, I guess that, that type of unforgiving nature, but in\n\n1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:33.700\n entirely, entirely permissive has its own issues.\n\n1:22:33.700 --> 1:22:37.700\n And I guess coming back into your, what your description of like describing a\n\n1:22:37.700 --> 1:22:41.460\n toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it's almost\n\n1:22:41.460 --> 1:22:43.140\n like, uh, it's like bird's eye view.\n\n1:22:43.140 --> 1:22:46.580\n Me, you know, you see, let's say a husband and a wife arguing, you know,\n\n1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:49.220\n like, all right, well, sort of somebody hitting somebody.\n\n1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:53.540\n I need to keep myself out of this because I have no idea what I'm seeing\n\n1:22:53.540 --> 1:22:57.300\n something, but I don't know what's going on or why specifically.\n\n1:22:57.300 --> 1:23:00.980\n And again, short of it going to a place that, that just out of bounds,\n\n1:23:02.100 --> 1:23:03.300\n I don't know who's right here.\n\n1:23:03.300 --> 1:23:04.260\n I don't know who's wrong.\n\n1:23:04.260 --> 1:23:07.300\n And I don't know what phase of this things are in.\n\n1:23:07.300 --> 1:23:12.660\n So I guess long term was good for both people.\n\n1:23:12.660 --> 1:23:12.900\n Right.\n\n1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:13.700\n It's dangerous for it.\n\n1:23:13.700 --> 1:23:16.660\n So if I want to put my finger on the scale, I can understand the desire to do\n\n1:23:16.660 --> 1:23:17.700\n them like, Hey guys, let's break it up.\n\n1:23:17.700 --> 1:23:18.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.140\n But, and that may be the right thing at the time, but at the same time, I'm not\n\n1:23:21.140 --> 1:23:21.460\n sure.\n\n1:23:21.460 --> 1:23:23.780\n So I think back to all of the times that.\n\n1:23:23.780 --> 1:23:27.940\n You know, that like you mentioned, your coach pushing you when very, very hard.\n\n1:23:27.940 --> 1:23:30.980\n And then other times going like, Hey, let's put it in perspective here.\n\n1:23:30.980 --> 1:23:33.140\n I think that's an interesting thing for high performance.\n\n1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:36.180\n And I think that we're seeing that again, societally, you know, now, or at least\n\n1:23:36.180 --> 1:23:40.500\n maybe that's just pops up on my internet feed periodically but coaches shouldn't\n\n1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:43.220\n be allowed to do this or yell at this person to yell at that person.\n\n1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:46.100\n Like, well, have you ever been go to a boxing gym?\n\n1:23:46.980 --> 1:23:48.180\n It's not a commercial entity.\n\n1:23:48.180 --> 1:23:54.100\n Not really a real box, not LA boxing, not a USC gym, like a real place.\n\n1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:57.460\n You're going to see what things are like when it's entirely performance based.\n\n1:23:57.460 --> 1:23:59.060\n Go to wrestling room at a high level.\n\n1:23:59.060 --> 1:24:01.620\n You know, again, there's, there's left and right limits and there are such\n\n1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:04.900\n things obviously as abuse, of course, but, and that should never be tolerated.\n\n1:24:04.900 --> 1:24:08.740\n Um, but it's not a commercial entity.\n\n1:24:09.620 --> 1:24:12.580\n I don't need to be sweet to you if you're, if you're screwing up, if you're\n\n1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:16.180\n dropping the ball and in fact, recognizing that I'm not doing you a favor or the\n\n1:24:16.180 --> 1:24:21.140\n favor or the team a favor by, by being permissive of that type of behavior.\n\n1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:22.340\n I think is important.\n\n1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:25.060\n Everything in its context and at its time is important.\n\n1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:28.980\n And I guess I can think again at the times that I've been put, put, or had\n\n1:24:28.980 --> 1:24:34.020\n put on me, like a great deal of pressure to do X, Y, or Z or to succeed, um, or\n\n1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:35.220\n to push for success.\n\n1:24:35.220 --> 1:24:38.980\n And I can't look back fondly enough on those times.\n\n1:24:38.980 --> 1:24:42.580\n They were tough at the time, but without that, I'm not sitting here without that.\n\n1:24:42.580 --> 1:24:48.820\n I don't go from growing up in a, in a very nice family in the suburbs to fighting at\n\n1:24:48.820 --> 1:24:52.820\n the highest level in jujitsu, gi, no gi, and now in mixed martial arts, starting a\n\n1:24:52.820 --> 1:24:53.940\n career at age 27.\n\n1:24:54.580 --> 1:24:58.260\n You know, I don't, it just doesn't happen because people generally speaking from\n\n1:24:58.260 --> 1:25:02.340\n that background, don't get pushed hard enough physically to be able to make that\n\n1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:02.900\n transition.\n\n1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:07.220\n And that has benefits and it has drawbacks.\n\n1:25:07.220 --> 1:25:09.540\n You know, when you stare into the abyss, it stares back.\n\n1:25:09.540 --> 1:25:12.020\n And I think that that's an important thing to understand.\n\n1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:15.860\n You know, you stare long enough, you, you can become something that you don't, that\n\n1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:17.060\n you would be sorry that you did.\n\n1:25:17.060 --> 1:25:20.340\n You don't look enough and you don't have perspective either.\n\n1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:22.980\n You know, and I, I think that that's an interesting thing.\n\n1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:26.340\n I can speak to someone who's relative to being someone who's relatively articulate\n\n1:25:26.340 --> 1:25:27.140\n and reasonable.\n\n1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:30.740\n I try to be reasonable, but you know, I'll say in sparring, if people get crazy with\n\n1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:32.900\n me, they get a warning and then I'm a crack them.\n\n1:25:33.460 --> 1:25:35.460\n And what did they expect?\n\n1:25:35.460 --> 1:25:40.500\n Oh, they hear the guy on a, on an interview, but who did they think they were meeting?\n\n1:25:40.500 --> 1:25:43.940\n Cause there's also the guy in the ring and there's layers there too.\n\n1:25:43.940 --> 1:25:45.060\n I remember training with you.\n\n1:25:45.060 --> 1:25:46.180\n It was kind of funny.\n\n1:25:46.900 --> 1:25:51.700\n There's like, there's, well, you didn't know who I was.\n\n1:25:51.700 --> 1:25:54.740\n I mean, you still like, I have a really good straight ankle up by the way.\n\n1:25:55.860 --> 1:25:56.360\n That.\n\n1:25:57.300 --> 1:26:01.940\n So I don't remember what rank I was, but it might've been purple or something like\n\n1:26:01.940 --> 1:26:02.180\n that.\n\n1:26:02.180 --> 1:26:08.100\n And I did some, like I, you had this look on your face, which I've often seen in\n\n1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:08.820\n black belts.\n\n1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:16.260\n It's like, here he goes again, like here, here's him trying this thing.\n\n1:26:16.980 --> 1:26:21.620\n And then when I kind of annoyed you a little bit with it, now I get that it was a good\n\n1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:25.700\n at like, I, you know, I did something somewhat effective, like some, like maybe a little\n\n1:26:25.700 --> 1:26:26.660\n bit off balance.\n\n1:26:26.660 --> 1:26:27.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:27.380 --> 1:26:31.300\n There's a, I just peeled off a little layer of Ryan Hall to where I was like, okay, let\n\n1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:38.500\n me, let me like, there, there's like layers underneath Mike Tyson somewhere in there.\n\n1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:41.940\n Like, so it was like, okay, this like new guy rolls in here.\n\n1:26:41.940 --> 1:26:44.260\n He thinks he can do the stupid thing.\n\n1:26:44.260 --> 1:26:46.740\n And then, and then you started to beat the hell out of me.\n\n1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:51.300\n But the, the, the point is there's layers here from the guy who was being interviewed\n\n1:26:51.300 --> 1:26:55.540\n now to like Genghis Khan, but it's, but it's all in the same body.\n\n1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:55.780\n Right.\n\n1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:57.380\n But it's like, all of us are like that, right.\n\n1:26:57.380 --> 1:27:00.020\n In various different directions and recognizing that's okay.\n\n1:27:00.020 --> 1:27:03.620\n It's just, there are consequences to all every choice that we make as a consequence.\n\n1:27:03.620 --> 1:27:06.260\n Sometimes there's like objectively wrong or objectively right.\n\n1:27:06.260 --> 1:27:08.500\n But at least in my mind, that's a pretty small box.\n\n1:27:08.500 --> 1:27:10.900\n Everything else is just, there's a consequence to that.\n\n1:27:10.900 --> 1:27:12.100\n Do you like that consequence?\n\n1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:13.060\n Do you not?\n\n1:27:13.060 --> 1:27:14.420\n And who do I want to become?\n\n1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:18.420\n What do I want to try to hone myself or anyone else into?\n\n1:27:18.420 --> 1:27:22.100\n And also like, but this is something I've screwed up as a coach plenty of times.\n\n1:27:22.100 --> 1:27:26.100\n You know, like if someone says, if you're, if like, I come to them like Lex, I really,\n\n1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:28.580\n really want to take, you know, research very seriously.\n\n1:27:28.580 --> 1:27:29.860\n Like, okay, I believe you.\n\n1:27:29.860 --> 1:27:33.300\n Now I haven't shown you that, but I believe you like, okay.\n\n1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:38.100\n And now me not showing up to research or to study or not being up until three in the morning\n\n1:27:38.100 --> 1:27:40.100\n thinking about this is no longer acceptable.\n\n1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:44.020\n There was a time like five seconds before me making that statement that if I went to\n\n1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:47.300\n bed without reading the book that I needed to read, no worries.\n\n1:27:47.300 --> 1:27:51.300\n But the second that I made that statement, your expectations for me changed.\n\n1:27:51.300 --> 1:27:55.220\n And maybe that's something that I've screwed up a whole bunch of times in my, as a teacher.\n\n1:27:55.220 --> 1:27:58.100\n Cause it's an interesting thing, obviously, you know, being a, like running a martial\n\n1:27:58.100 --> 1:28:03.380\n arts school is as you're principally an athlete is sometimes I don't pay enough attention\n\n1:28:03.380 --> 1:28:04.420\n to what people are doing.\n\n1:28:04.420 --> 1:28:05.380\n I just go, oh, okay.\n\n1:28:05.380 --> 1:28:06.260\n You say X, Y, Z.\n\n1:28:06.260 --> 1:28:07.060\n I'm like, Roger that.\n\n1:28:07.060 --> 1:28:07.540\n I believe you.\n\n1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:08.100\n Cool.\n\n1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:13.380\n I will now put you in category X and whether rightly or wrongly, like maybe this person\n\n1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:16.660\n didn't understand what they were asking for, or I didn't express this or the other.\n\n1:28:16.660 --> 1:28:18.500\n And it just, it caused cross wires.\n\n1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:20.180\n And then most times you just, you hash it out.\n\n1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:22.580\n You have a discussion, you figure out, get to the bottom of what people are trying to\n\n1:28:22.580 --> 1:28:23.300\n do or what they want.\n\n1:28:23.860 --> 1:28:26.980\n But if I was paying more attention, I think I could have been a lot more effective.\n\n1:28:26.980 --> 1:28:30.100\n Or if I had more experience and sometimes maybe I'm not sharp enough or I don't, I'm\n\n1:28:30.100 --> 1:28:32.420\n not perceptive enough to be able to, to see what's going on.\n\n1:28:32.420 --> 1:28:36.260\n And maybe with years more down the line, I'll be able to have a sharper perception.\n\n1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:41.060\n But I think that's another one of those interesting things that some, that sometimes I would caution\n\n1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:44.740\n or not caution, but just inform a prospective martial arts student, depending upon where\n\n1:28:44.740 --> 1:28:49.300\n you're going you know, this you, both you and also your coach or other people in the\n\n1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:50.340\n room, they wear many hats.\n\n1:28:50.340 --> 1:28:52.100\n And sometimes there's a, I had the wrong hat on.\n\n1:28:52.100 --> 1:28:54.260\n You were talking to me as Lex the guy.\n\n1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:55.620\n I didn't realize you were talking to me.\n\n1:28:55.620 --> 1:28:56.820\n I thought you were talking to me as Lex the guy.\n\n1:28:56.820 --> 1:28:58.500\n I didn't realize you're talking to me as Lex the martial artist.\n\n1:28:58.500 --> 1:28:59.460\n I'm like, Oh crap.\n\n1:28:59.460 --> 1:29:00.500\n I was talking to the wrong person.\n\n1:29:00.500 --> 1:29:05.620\n So it's almost like if you had a, like I run my gym with my wife, she's a black belt.\n\n1:29:05.620 --> 1:29:07.300\n So she's my wife.\n\n1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:11.380\n She's my peers as a martial artist, uh, in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:29:11.380 --> 1:29:12.820\n He's here by the way, in judging.\n\n1:29:12.820 --> 1:29:13.780\n So exactly.\n\n1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:14.100\n All right.\n\n1:29:14.100 --> 1:29:15.060\n Well, all right.\n\n1:29:15.060 --> 1:29:16.820\n So, but, but a fellow black belt.\n\n1:29:16.820 --> 1:29:19.300\n And I guess like another thing, she doesn't have a microphone, so you can't hear all the\n\n1:29:19.300 --> 1:29:20.100\n trash she's talking.\n\n1:29:20.100 --> 1:29:20.820\n Exactly.\n\n1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:21.940\n But it can be tough.\n\n1:29:21.940 --> 1:29:23.460\n And that's something that we've had to work through a lot.\n\n1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:26.260\n And it's like looking back and it's like now being where I'm at now.\n\n1:29:26.260 --> 1:29:29.140\n And it's easy for me to say that cause she's in the room and I don't want her to stab me,\n\n1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:33.540\n just continue to slowly poison me over time, which frankly I understand.\n\n1:29:33.540 --> 1:29:38.180\n Um, you know, it's, it's the sort of thing that is now way more effective than anything\n\n1:29:38.180 --> 1:29:40.660\n else I could really reasonably expect to have.\n\n1:29:40.660 --> 1:29:45.300\n Um, but there were times when, when both of us, you know, were justifiably annoyed at\n\n1:29:45.300 --> 1:29:47.700\n the other because of crossed wires.\n\n1:29:47.700 --> 1:29:50.260\n And sometimes, you know, you'll just have to scream in any way or misunderstanding anyway.\n\n1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:54.180\n But again, like I've, I coached some of my friends, I've coached, I've coached my friend\n\n1:29:54.180 --> 1:29:56.580\n who I've known since I was four years old.\n\n1:29:56.580 --> 1:29:58.740\n You know, sometimes I don't go, Hey buddy, how are you doing?\n\n1:29:58.740 --> 1:30:00.180\n Sometimes it's like, what the fuck are you doing?\n\n1:30:00.180 --> 1:30:00.740\n Put your hand over there.\n\n1:30:00.740 --> 1:30:01.780\n How many times we talked about this?\n\n1:30:01.780 --> 1:30:06.100\n And then you walk away and you can see him look at you crooked and you're like, Oh crap.\n\n1:30:06.100 --> 1:30:06.260\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:07.620\n He thought I was talking to his friend.\n\n1:30:07.620 --> 1:30:07.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:07.780 --> 1:30:11.220\n Well, all right, let, we need to talk this one out, hashing out and not he's wrong.\n\n1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:12.820\n How could he possibly think that way?\n\n1:30:12.820 --> 1:30:14.340\n Like, Oh no, I totally understand that.\n\n1:30:14.340 --> 1:30:18.500\n But if I was 22, like doesn't need no, I'm a purple belt, some nonsense like that.\n\n1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:22.260\n And it's, and it doesn't come from a bad place, but it's just, I guess that comes back to\n\n1:30:22.260 --> 1:30:23.140\n society to anything.\n\n1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:26.020\n People only had the perspective that they have and the awareness that we have.\n\n1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:30.260\n And so again, going back and going, Hey guys, grace, like I don't expect, it's not fair\n\n1:30:30.260 --> 1:30:32.180\n for me to go, I fight UFC.\n\n1:30:32.180 --> 1:30:36.100\n Why doesn't this guy who came in as an attorney understand how hardcore this needs to be?\n\n1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:36.980\n I'm like, how could he?\n\n1:30:36.980 --> 1:30:37.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:37.620 --> 1:30:43.700\n And at the same time though, if, if I'm using the language of someone that is interested\n\n1:30:43.700 --> 1:30:46.820\n in at least performance from a martial arts perspective, I understand how that could be\n\n1:30:47.380 --> 1:30:47.940\n off putting.\n\n1:30:47.940 --> 1:30:51.220\n Let's say for instance, someone that's like all of that would be out of bounds in their\n\n1:30:51.220 --> 1:30:52.340\n normal workplace.\n\n1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:56.340\n But if they think of the gym as my office, then whether they agree or disagree with what's\n\n1:30:56.340 --> 1:30:58.740\n going on, they go, okay, I hear why I see why that might happen.\n\n1:30:58.740 --> 1:30:59.860\n Let's talk about this.\n\n1:30:59.860 --> 1:31:04.580\n And we can, again, all push forward in a positive direction that benefits, I guess, everyone's\n\n1:31:04.580 --> 1:31:05.860\n journey throughout the activity.\n\n1:31:05.860 --> 1:31:08.740\n And on top of all that, there's moods.\n\n1:31:08.740 --> 1:31:15.540\n Like I, I mean, especially lately, I think two days ago, maybe yesterday, no, two days\n\n1:31:15.540 --> 1:31:21.140\n ago, I've never been that cranky in my life.\n\n1:31:21.140 --> 1:31:27.140\n I think, I don't know what it was, but I wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me.\n\n1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:34.660\n It was like, I was just very conscious of this feeling of like, why, why is this happening\n\n1:31:34.660 --> 1:31:35.220\n right now?\n\n1:31:35.220 --> 1:31:40.260\n So I consciously decided as I usually do in those cases to not say anything to anybody.\n\n1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:41.060\n How do you do that?\n\n1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:47.060\n Well, I, you know, it's, it's yeah.\n\n1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:52.420\n Meditate because it's not, I tend to, I tend to then visualize what's going to happen in\n\n1:31:52.420 --> 1:31:55.060\n the next, like, how is this going to make my life better?\n\n1:31:55.700 --> 1:32:06.900\n Like if I say something that mean to somebody else, I have just started a conflict that\n\n1:32:07.460 --> 1:32:13.140\n will just escalate, will continue, will add more conflict to my life.\n\n1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:17.380\n It will make things, I just don't like the feeling you will create.\n\n1:32:17.380 --> 1:32:23.700\n And so you live in enough life to know that like, it's just like with like street fighting.\n\n1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:28.900\n I would get into a lot of fights when I was younger, just on the street, but then you\n\n1:32:28.900 --> 1:32:32.820\n realize like, it's not like a jujitsu match or something like that.\n\n1:32:32.820 --> 1:32:34.900\n It's not, it'll escalate.\n\n1:32:35.380 --> 1:32:38.020\n It'll, it might come back at you.\n\n1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:40.900\n It'll like that person might find you again.\n\n1:32:40.900 --> 1:32:48.580\n But more importantly, the anxiety of it, of having created little enemies in this\n\n1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:51.700\n world, distorts the way you see the world.\n\n1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:57.380\n So I've noticed that like, if I am shitty to people on the internet, which I haven't\n\n1:32:57.380 --> 1:33:02.820\n been, I think in a long time is like, it, it somehow brings the shittiness to you\n\n1:33:02.820 --> 1:33:07.300\n more and more, it escalates like the more love you put out there, the more like the\n\n1:33:07.300 --> 1:33:11.140\n people who put love out, like surround you.\n\n1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:12.580\n Well, you mentioned forgiveness as well.\n\n1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:16.900\n Like you said, like, I guess back to the original, you know, the Holocaust survivor\n\n1:33:16.900 --> 1:33:20.740\n scenario where you're like, oh my God, like you think of the ultimate in, in like, I've\n\n1:33:20.740 --> 1:33:24.980\n never experienced one, one billionth of that level of, of pain and horror.\n\n1:33:24.980 --> 1:33:27.300\n And it's like, and I can't let this little thing go.\n\n1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:29.460\n You know, I guess that's an interesting thing.\n\n1:33:29.460 --> 1:33:32.420\n I think you're just making the point in your personal life, I guess the same way.\n\n1:33:32.420 --> 1:33:32.900\n Right?\n\n1:33:33.220 --> 1:33:33.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:34.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:34.580 --> 1:33:35.860\n And on the internet, it's hard.\n\n1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:42.100\n I've somehow gotten, I mean, you've, you've had a level of celebrity for a while.\n\n1:33:42.420 --> 1:33:47.620\n I've recently gotten some level of like celebrity and like these people who are\n\n1:33:47.620 --> 1:33:53.700\n just shitty for no reason come out from all, from all places, like calling me a\n\n1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:57.380\n fraud or anything else.\n\n1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:59.380\n It was Jay and Silent Bob, Strike Back.\n\n1:33:59.540 --> 1:34:01.940\n They find out a movie is going to be made about them and people were talking shit\n\n1:34:01.940 --> 1:34:03.460\n on the internet and they're like, what's the internet?\n\n1:34:03.460 --> 1:34:05.860\n And then someone shows them and they're like, what?\n\n1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:08.580\n And they go to a message board and they go to Hollywood to try to stop it from\n\n1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:09.060\n being made.\n\n1:34:09.060 --> 1:34:11.700\n And they eventually get money for their likeness and they use the money to buy\n\n1:34:11.700 --> 1:34:14.420\n plane tickets and fly around and beat the shit out of all the people that talk bad\n\n1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:14.820\n about them.\n\n1:34:15.380 --> 1:34:15.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:16.020\n It's tough.\n\n1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:20.420\n I mean, it's I'm, I'm having trouble with it cause there's people like, yeah,\n\n1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:24.820\n there's, you know, there's posts and forums and like heated discussions about\n\n1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:26.420\n is like sweeping a fraud.\n\n1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:27.540\n I don't know.\n\n1:34:27.700 --> 1:34:28.740\n What has he really done?\n\n1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:32.020\n And there's like, and then there's people like, well, I think he's an all right\n\n1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:33.060\n guy, but I'm not sure.\n\n1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:39.060\n Like, like there's like literal discussions and I'm like, like nobody,\n\n1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:43.460\n like if you increase the level of celebrity, there's going to be like one\n\n1:34:43.460 --> 1:34:47.780\n of the things that hurts my heart a little bit is like some level of toxicity\n\n1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:48.900\n around Joe Rogan.\n\n1:34:48.900 --> 1:34:54.340\n For example, there's like communities of people that now like talk about him\n\n1:34:54.340 --> 1:34:56.260\n selling out, for example, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:34:56.820 --> 1:35:02.900\n And I don't, you know, and Joe I've talked to him about it is amazing that\n\n1:35:02.900 --> 1:35:05.540\n he he says, don't read the comments.\n\n1:35:05.540 --> 1:35:07.300\n He legitimately doesn't read the comments.\n\n1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:12.020\n His heart and his soul doesn't give a damn about the comments.\n\n1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.500\n All he gives a damn about is his friends.\n\n1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:19.060\n Like one of the things that's really inspiring to me and that's I've had a\n\n1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:24.660\n conversation with them offline about Spotify and the removed episodes.\n\n1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:25.460\n People are curious.\n\n1:35:25.460 --> 1:35:26.180\n What's Spotify?\n\n1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:32.260\n Um, it's, uh, it's a thing on the internet where, uh, I think you can play\n\n1:35:32.260 --> 1:35:40.260\n Taylor Swift songs on, um, but you can also now play Joe Rogan podcasts and\n\n1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:42.100\n they gave him a hundred million dollars.\n\n1:35:42.100 --> 1:35:46.420\n So that that's, um, you know, that's it's yeah.\n\n1:35:46.980 --> 1:35:51.220\n Uh, but the thing I've had a discussion with him and I made a video about it\n\n1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:55.780\n that I took down because of the toxicity is like, it's hard to put into words,\n\n1:35:55.780 --> 1:35:59.620\n but he will give away the a hundred million in a second.\n\n1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:06.260\n If he ever has to compromise who he is, like he doesn't, I mean, he already\n\n1:36:06.260 --> 1:36:10.500\n said, as he talked about, he's made quote unquote, fuck you money a long\n\n1:36:10.500 --> 1:36:14.420\n time ago, he doesn't need any more money.\n\n1:36:14.420 --> 1:36:15.140\n He doesn't care.\n\n1:36:15.940 --> 1:36:19.220\n It's nice to have money, whatever, but like, he'll give it away.\n\n1:36:19.220 --> 1:36:26.740\n So the it's nice to see when people like him at a level of celebrity level of\n\n1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:31.460\n success and financial success, don't change at all.\n\n1:36:31.460 --> 1:36:36.420\n They're just the same thing that makes you happy is talking in his case, talking\n\n1:36:36.420 --> 1:36:40.020\n shit with his friends in the case of most of us really just, just hanging out\n\n1:36:40.020 --> 1:36:46.020\n with friends, doing the things you love in his case, doing the things he loves\n\n1:36:46.020 --> 1:36:53.860\n without any, like, you know, the Texas way, the freedom, like without any\n\n1:36:53.860 --> 1:36:58.180\n corporate bureaucracy bullshit that rolls in and says, well, maybe you\n\n1:36:58.180 --> 1:37:02.500\n shouldn't say fuck, you know, like more than 20 times a podcast or something\n\n1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:05.940\n like that, like those kinds of like rules, like people, like he says in a\n\n1:37:05.940 --> 1:37:10.740\n suit and tie, they show up and say stuff oddly enough people that could never\n\n1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:12.420\n have done what he does.\n\n1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:13.300\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:15.860\n And it's kind of inspiring to see that.\n\n1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:21.860\n And I hope people, I hope people realize how special of a human he is.\n\n1:37:21.860 --> 1:37:27.140\n He's inspired like people like me, like I'm just, I'm a scientist, right?\n\n1:37:27.140 --> 1:37:32.260\n So he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of life to be like\n\n1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:35.780\n kind to others, to be open minded.\n\n1:37:36.420 --> 1:37:39.380\n I don't know that it's a special dude.\n\n1:37:39.380 --> 1:37:42.740\n So like people need to support that and treasure that as opposed to\n\n1:37:42.740 --> 1:37:47.540\n as opposed to be toxic about it.\n\n1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:55.140\n I mean, what people really for a long time have told me that it would be\n\n1:37:55.140 --> 1:37:57.700\n awesome if Ryan Hall goes on Joe Rogan.\n\n1:37:57.700 --> 1:38:00.100\n I definitely think that would be an awesome thing.\n\n1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:02.180\n Have you listened to Joe?\n\n1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:04.900\n Has he been a part of your life in some kind of way?\n\n1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:08.660\n You know, well, Joe's always, I remember watching Joe on Fear Factor when I\n\n1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:09.780\n was a little kid, which is cool.\n\n1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:14.820\n So I've actually gotten to like, from a bird's eye view, watch his kind of\n\n1:38:14.820 --> 1:38:16.180\n just path through life.\n\n1:38:16.180 --> 1:38:19.940\n But one of the things that I always appreciate, and again, I barely know Joe\n\n1:38:19.940 --> 1:38:20.740\n other than to shake his hand.\n\n1:38:20.740 --> 1:38:24.340\n He interviewed me after the, briefly in the ring after the BJ pan fight.\n\n1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:28.820\n But one of the things that I've always admired about Joe is that I think he\n\n1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:30.100\n had fucking money from the start.\n\n1:38:30.660 --> 1:38:33.460\n I think that zero dollars is fucking money for Joe.\n\n1:38:33.460 --> 1:38:37.940\n I think, and that's something I respect about him a great deal because as you\n\n1:38:37.940 --> 1:38:42.660\n say, it's interesting to watch, it's like you hope that George St. Pierre is\n\n1:38:42.660 --> 1:38:42.980\n like this.\n\n1:38:42.980 --> 1:38:46.260\n It's really, I'm not super close to George, but we're teammates at TriStar\n\n1:38:46.260 --> 1:38:47.700\n and he's never been anything but a gentleman.\n\n1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:50.900\n He's one of those people that if you didn't know George was famous when you\n\n1:38:50.900 --> 1:38:52.340\n walk into the gym, you'd have no idea.\n\n1:38:52.340 --> 1:38:53.860\n He's not holding court, not doing it.\n\n1:38:53.860 --> 1:38:56.740\n He's just, you know, training and he'll help out an amateur doing this.\n\n1:38:56.740 --> 1:38:58.180\n If you have a question for him, he'll help me.\n\n1:38:58.180 --> 1:38:58.900\n Like I'm nobody, man.\n\n1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:01.140\n He would give me advice and train me.\n\n1:39:01.140 --> 1:39:02.180\n It was super cool.\n\n1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:04.020\n And he didn't kill me, which I really appreciated.\n\n1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:05.140\n He's a gentleman.\n\n1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:09.860\n But you know, it's like you meet someone and you go, man, it's so cool that\n\n1:39:09.860 --> 1:39:13.940\n this is the guy who's the best, that this is the guy who has been successful.\n\n1:39:13.940 --> 1:39:16.820\n And then you go, why are they successful?\n\n1:39:16.820 --> 1:39:18.020\n Like I said, true to what they're doing.\n\n1:39:18.020 --> 1:39:18.820\n They haven't changed.\n\n1:39:18.820 --> 1:39:19.700\n They're the same as they've been.\n\n1:39:19.700 --> 1:39:23.540\n And I remember I got to TriStar in 2012 and George was already George St.\n\n1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:25.940\n Pierre, but I remember watching and talking to people and they're like,\n\n1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:27.380\n oh man, George is the same as he's always been.\n\n1:39:27.380 --> 1:39:27.780\n And it's neat.\n\n1:39:27.780 --> 1:39:30.500\n I see him in the gym training now and again, giving advice now.\n\n1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:33.220\n And it seems like Joe has always been consistent.\n\n1:39:33.220 --> 1:39:37.620\n And it's neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and not change\n\n1:39:37.620 --> 1:39:38.100\n who they are.\n\n1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.740\n And not, you know, periodically, like, you know, again, we all make mistakes.\n\n1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:42.340\n Like you have a bad day or this or that.\n\n1:39:42.340 --> 1:39:45.380\n And an apology needs to be issued or even my bad or this or that.\n\n1:39:45.380 --> 1:39:48.420\n And you're like, yeah, and they just move on that they're not afraid to be\n\n1:39:48.420 --> 1:39:50.660\n themselves and they're not afraid to be wrong.\n\n1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:51.940\n They're not afraid to make a mistake.\n\n1:39:51.940 --> 1:39:54.900\n As you mentioned, open mind and some like, so what are the correct beliefs to\n\n1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:57.780\n have about this that I know going in, everyone's going to be okay with what\n\n1:39:57.780 --> 1:40:00.180\n I'm saying, which is usually the beginning of a conversation that's\n\n1:40:00.180 --> 1:40:00.900\n going to go nowhere.\n\n1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:01.540\n Right.\n\n1:40:01.540 --> 1:40:07.380\n And, uh, it's, it's neat to see, um, the things I guess that he's created on\n\n1:40:07.380 --> 1:40:10.740\n his own as a result of the authenticity that's there.\n\n1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:12.420\n And it reminds me of like Dave Chappelle.\n\n1:40:12.420 --> 1:40:15.460\n And, and again, I don't know, I've never met Dave, but it's neat to see\n\n1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:20.340\n someone that's clearly again, authentic in their own way, doing their own\n\n1:40:20.340 --> 1:40:20.740\n thing.\n\n1:40:20.740 --> 1:40:24.020\n And they're because of that, they're above the corporate nonsense.\n\n1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:27.460\n But what's funny, I think the message behind all of it is, Hey guys, we\n\n1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:30.820\n all are, I can't promise you that I'm going to have money.\n\n1:40:30.820 --> 1:40:32.500\n Joe couldn't promise you that he's going to have money.\n\n1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:37.540\n Now it ended up working out, but he was above that nonsense from the jump.\n\n1:40:38.180 --> 1:40:41.300\n And he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just\n\n1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:42.900\n going like, yeah, I'm going to be a reasonable person.\n\n1:40:42.900 --> 1:40:43.860\n I'm going to try to learn.\n\n1:40:43.860 --> 1:40:45.140\n I'm going to try to grow.\n\n1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:48.820\n And, uh, if I say something annoying, you can come and talk to me about it.\n\n1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:49.780\n We can get to the bottom of it.\n\n1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:52.740\n And I'm like, if I need to say my bad, thanks, appreciate it.\n\n1:40:52.740 --> 1:40:53.300\n You know, I will.\n\n1:40:53.300 --> 1:40:55.620\n And if I don't need to, I'm like, Hey, I still appreciate the talk.\n\n1:40:55.620 --> 1:40:56.100\n Thanks man.\n\n1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:58.500\n I'll shake your hand and we'd carry on and we'd go our separate ways and\n\n1:40:58.500 --> 1:40:59.860\n hopefully I'll treat you with respect.\n\n1:40:59.860 --> 1:41:02.420\n You treat me with respect and that's about it.\n\n1:41:02.420 --> 1:41:06.260\n And I guess I think it's a lesson that it can work out no matter what you\n\n1:41:06.260 --> 1:41:08.900\n don't have to count out to like these weird powers that be.\n\n1:41:09.780 --> 1:41:13.620\n And whether you're at this level or at this level, but you can live your\n\n1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:14.580\n life the way that you want.\n\n1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:16.900\n And as you mentioned, talk to your friends, hang out, be happy.\n\n1:41:16.900 --> 1:41:18.740\n And it just so happens that that resonates with people.\n\n1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:22.180\n It actually reminds me of like, uh, speaking to MIT and being in Boston is\n\n1:41:22.180 --> 1:41:23.540\n like a good will hunting.\n\n1:41:23.540 --> 1:41:25.940\n You know, like, again, that's what did he really want to do?\n\n1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:26.740\n He could have gone this way.\n\n1:41:26.740 --> 1:41:27.620\n Could have gone that way.\n\n1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:31.380\n And it was an interesting story, but it's like this person wants to hang out\n\n1:41:31.380 --> 1:41:33.380\n with his buddies and wants to do other things.\n\n1:41:33.380 --> 1:41:35.940\n And again, it happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these\n\n1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:37.700\n other things, but there was.\n\n1:41:38.660 --> 1:41:41.940\n I guess it's like, at least in my mind, a story of authenticity as well.\n\n1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:44.580\n And it was both the same thing in the Robin Williams character.\n\n1:41:44.580 --> 1:41:49.140\n And I just think that that's a message cause watch watching things occur on\n\n1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:50.500\n the internet as they do now.\n\n1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:52.660\n Think so many things playing out in the public eye.\n\n1:41:52.660 --> 1:41:56.180\n I feel like so many private or otherwise formerly private discussions and\n\n1:41:56.180 --> 1:42:00.980\n disputes and, and, you know, interactions now become, they all have a, a, well,\n\n1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:02.740\n what is this going to say when it goes public?\n\n1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:04.340\n So how can I couch what I'm saying?\n\n1:42:04.340 --> 1:42:07.220\n Or how can I word this in a way that's going to get people on my side or use\n\n1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:09.540\n the right buzzwords and not use the wrong buzzwords.\n\n1:42:09.540 --> 1:42:10.980\n And it's just neat to see people.\n\n1:42:11.860 --> 1:42:14.820\n You know, in their own way, flip the bird to the head, because I just think\n\n1:42:14.820 --> 1:42:18.340\n that that's, that's just not how a human being is meant to think or interact.\n\n1:42:18.340 --> 1:42:27.060\n I'm curious what you think about the thing that recently has, you know, me like\n\n1:42:27.060 --> 1:42:32.580\n hosting this podcast, I sometimes think about like, who should I talk to and not\n\n1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:39.380\n in terms of like, it's the, the old Hitler question now, Hitler, I would definitely\n\n1:42:39.380 --> 1:42:43.940\n talk to because post world war II, because everyone knows he's evil.\n\n1:42:43.940 --> 1:42:51.220\n The question, whether you talk to Hitler in 1937, like when people who are really\n\n1:42:51.220 --> 1:42:56.020\n students of what's going on, understand that this is a very dangerous human being.\n\n1:42:57.700 --> 1:43:02.820\n But a large number of the part of the world are like, well, he's a leader who\n\n1:43:02.820 --> 1:43:03.700\n cares for Germany.\n\n1:43:04.260 --> 1:43:09.220\n So the question I have, it's interesting to me, it involves a particular person\n\n1:43:09.220 --> 1:43:13.140\n named who also lives in Austin, Texas named Alex Jones.\n\n1:43:13.140 --> 1:43:14.500\n I don't know if you're familiar with the guy.\n\n1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:16.020\n I am familiar with Mr. Jones.\n\n1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:23.700\n I've actually recently just listened to Infowars, like one episode of his show,\n\n1:43:23.700 --> 1:43:25.060\n I guess that he does every day.\n\n1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:31.060\n And it kind of reminds me of a time in college when I drank too much tequila.\n\n1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:33.860\n There's no turning back.\n\n1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:41.300\n Like, it's like, like the mistakes you make that like, it's, I mean, you don't\n\n1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:45.620\n know where you're going to wake up, you don't know who you're going to kill or\n\n1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:49.700\n not kill or steal or rob, it's unclear.\n\n1:43:49.700 --> 1:43:55.460\n So that, it felt like I was getting pulled into a dark place where pretty\n\n1:43:55.460 --> 1:43:59.860\n much everybody is a pedophile that's trying to control the world.\n\n1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:02.980\n So Bill Gates definitely is a pedophile.\n\n1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:08.260\n Everybody in power, anybody in power, there's a kind of a deep skepticism\n\n1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:14.580\n about power and a conspiratorial way to see the world where everything is\n\n1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:17.620\n like dark forces in all corners.\n\n1:44:17.620 --> 1:44:20.980\n It's like the way you feel when you're a kid, that there's a monster hiding\n\n1:44:20.980 --> 1:44:21.860\n in the closet.\n\n1:44:21.860 --> 1:44:24.980\n Which is also why you leap over the bed from like four feet away.\n\n1:44:24.980 --> 1:44:26.100\n There's a strategy.\n\n1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:26.500\n Yes.\n\n1:44:26.500 --> 1:44:28.740\n So, but he says that you're just being weak.\n\n1:44:28.740 --> 1:44:30.180\n You need to look under the bed.\n\n1:44:30.180 --> 1:44:33.460\n Under the bed, there's monsters and we need to be aware of them because\n\n1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:35.380\n they're growing, they're multiplying.\n\n1:44:35.380 --> 1:44:36.260\n You should be.\n\n1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:37.380\n And they're touching children.\n\n1:44:37.380 --> 1:44:38.580\n They're touching children.\n\n1:44:38.580 --> 1:44:39.460\n Exactly.\n\n1:44:39.460 --> 1:44:40.820\n So it all connects.\n\n1:44:40.820 --> 1:44:46.020\n But the, the, I, when I listened to him and I thought about like, do I want\n\n1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:52.580\n to talk to him on this podcast, for example, when I listened to his\n\n1:44:52.580 --> 1:44:56.660\n conversation with Joe Rogan, the two times he talked on there, to me,\n\n1:44:56.660 --> 1:44:59.540\n it was somehow entertaining.\n\n1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:01.860\n Like it was fun to listen to.\n\n1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:08.020\n It's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours because it's almost\n\n1:45:08.020 --> 1:45:08.740\n like theater.\n\n1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.340\n Like, this is what I talked to Joe about.\n\n1:45:13.460 --> 1:45:18.660\n When people try to censor Alex Jones, Joe says that the people who try\n\n1:45:18.660 --> 1:45:22.900\n to censor him don't give enough credit to the intelligence of human\n\n1:45:22.900 --> 1:45:28.580\n beings to like, understand like that, like what a person says on a\n\n1:45:28.580 --> 1:45:32.420\n large platform does not necessarily is not the truth.\n\n1:45:32.420 --> 1:45:36.740\n You can be a madman and say crazy things and people are intelligent\n\n1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:42.660\n enough to hear certain things being, when they're said like the earth\n\n1:45:42.660 --> 1:45:46.820\n is flat, they can, they can be intelligent enough not to all of a\n\n1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:49.460\n sudden start believing that the earth is flat.\n\n1:45:49.460 --> 1:45:53.140\n Like they, they're intelligent enough to sort of select different\n\n1:45:53.140 --> 1:45:57.460\n ideas and be able to enjoy the theater of a particular ridiculous\n\n1:45:57.460 --> 1:46:01.220\n over the top conversation without being sort of influenced to where\n\n1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:04.260\n they start believing like toxic set of beliefs.\n\n1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:11.860\n Now there's a lot of sort of other kinds of people, especially now\n\n1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:14.660\n with cancel culture that say, well, you don't want to give platform\n\n1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:20.020\n to crazy people that ultimately whose beliefs might lead to dangerous\n\n1:46:20.020 --> 1:46:20.900\n consequences.\n\n1:46:20.900 --> 1:46:25.060\n Like, and I see it very often now with conspiracy theories that go,\n\n1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:26.980\n that go like way too far.\n\n1:46:26.980 --> 1:46:32.580\n Like for example, would, I, I'm not, I haven't looked into it, so I'm\n\n1:46:32.580 --> 1:46:40.740\n sorry, I will look into it, but it hurts my heart to see that on Bill\n\n1:46:40.740 --> 1:46:46.580\n Gates, in my opinion, the person who has saved and improved more lives\n\n1:46:46.580 --> 1:46:51.460\n than probably any human history, literally because of the money he's\n\n1:46:51.460 --> 1:46:55.540\n invested in helping, like just, just the work he's done on like malaria\n\n1:46:55.780 --> 1:46:59.140\n in Africa, the number of people he's helped is huge.\n\n1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:04.900\n And yet every interview, anything you see now on Bill Gates, everyone\n\n1:47:04.900 --> 1:47:08.740\n is calling him, I believe haven't looked into it, but I believe\n\n1:47:08.740 --> 1:47:10.020\n everyone's calling him a pedophile.\n\n1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:14.500\n I don't know the full structure of it, but it's, it's just a very, it\n\n1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:18.100\n feels like an army of like, it feels like it's hundreds of thousands\n\n1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:18.580\n of people.\n\n1:47:18.580 --> 1:47:19.460\n That's what it feels like.\n\n1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:23.060\n It might be a much smaller percentage, but it feels like a huge number\n\n1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:24.340\n of people are calling him a pedophile.\n\n1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:26.260\n So that's the, that's the flip side.\n\n1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:29.620\n If you allow, if you give platform to conspiracy theories like that,\n\n1:47:30.180 --> 1:47:33.380\n then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population\n\n1:47:33.380 --> 1:47:34.660\n believe in these crazy things.\n\n1:47:35.140 --> 1:47:37.700\n I just, I wanted to put it out there.\n\n1:47:37.700 --> 1:47:39.780\n Cause I don't know what to think of that.\n\n1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:43.860\n If you put yourself in Joe Rogan's shoes, if you put yourself in my\n\n1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:47.940\n shoes, if you put yourself just in your own shoes, I mean, I'm even\n\n1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:49.620\n I'm in my shoes right now.\n\n1:47:49.620 --> 1:47:49.860\n Great.\n\n1:47:49.860 --> 1:47:51.700\n If you're staying in your shoes, just stay in your shoes.\n\n1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:57.780\n Can I have your, would you talk, would you give platform to people like\n\n1:47:57.780 --> 1:48:05.220\n Alex Jones, would, would you talk to somebody like Alex Jones or, or not?\n\n1:48:05.940 --> 1:48:07.300\n Uh, I, yes, I would.\n\n1:48:07.300 --> 1:48:09.140\n And I feel very strongly about this, honestly.\n\n1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:14.260\n Um, well, I think that it's, it's an interesting thing and I, I would\n\n1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:18.100\n just say a lot of times, um, I can understand, you know, very, very\n\n1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:23.620\n clearly why people would take issue with the idea of, I guess what they\n\n1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:28.260\n proceed to be amplifying this man's voice, this man's reach, um, you\n\n1:48:28.260 --> 1:48:30.740\n know, as, as a demonstrable negative.\n\n1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:37.060\n But I think, um, you know, when you take a step back further, uh, the,\n\n1:48:37.060 --> 1:48:40.900\n the cure is more damaging than the disease and significantly.\n\n1:48:40.900 --> 1:48:47.780\n So, um, I guess I think that I'm very, very wary of, I think being where\n\n1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:51.620\n you mentioned Alex Jones being wary of power and people with it, that's\n\n1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:56.820\n a lot of times there's a lot of truth and validity to crazy things that\n\n1:48:56.820 --> 1:49:01.700\n people say it's the conspiracy theories that stick are the ones that sound\n\n1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:04.980\n credible, at least quasi credible in some aspect.\n\n1:49:05.140 --> 1:49:07.620\n And it's almost like it seems to me like an anchor in people's mind.\n\n1:49:07.620 --> 1:49:11.540\n And it is also funny to me, obviously the, the Bill Gates, it's so funny\n\n1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:15.700\n to tar people with things like pedophile, racist, rapist, like, these\n\n1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:18.660\n are things that we're basically trying to pick words that no one can ever\n\n1:49:18.660 --> 1:49:20.260\n support someone who does these things.\n\n1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:24.580\n And that's, you know, and that changes year by year.\n\n1:49:24.580 --> 1:49:30.660\n Like currently pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebody just,\n\n1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:35.140\n just as a, it used to be communist or Marxist Cleveland Browns fan, you\n\n1:49:35.140 --> 1:49:38.580\n know, like, come on, you know, actually nobody likes the Browns.\n\n1:49:38.580 --> 1:49:39.380\n So I'll agree with you.\n\n1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:40.580\n That was, that's why I picked them.\n\n1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:43.380\n That's the trick is you find a group of people that nobody likes.\n\n1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:44.260\n We're good here.\n\n1:49:44.420 --> 1:49:44.740\n All right.\n\n1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:47.940\n That's the move, but, uh, yeah, that's a creepy thing though, because\n\n1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:52.020\n that is, that is the creepy thing is like, if people are always looking\n\n1:49:52.020 --> 1:49:54.340\n for groups of people are always looking for, and I find this really deeply\n\n1:49:54.340 --> 1:49:58.340\n disturbing, um, like, Hey, so who's the guy that we can all get away with?\n\n1:49:58.660 --> 1:50:02.580\n You know, just treating like dirt, who's the guy that I can be a dick to?\n\n1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:05.140\n I can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's going to say anything.\n\n1:50:05.380 --> 1:50:09.860\n And it's, even if I, you know, people do that with, whether it's literal\n\n1:50:09.860 --> 1:50:13.940\n Nazis or someone that I called a Nazi, you know, I guess what's the bigger issue,\n\n1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:16.980\n this person's ridiculous beliefs or what I'm doing.\n\n1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:21.060\n And you mentioned Hitler before, and obviously Mein Kampf being a, you know,\n\n1:50:21.140 --> 1:50:24.980\n like the outline for some of the things he did later and when the evil was it\n\n1:50:24.980 --> 1:50:28.980\n always there, did it, did it take root later on or flourish later on?\n\n1:50:28.980 --> 1:50:34.020\n But was, was Adolf Hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas or\n\n1:50:34.020 --> 1:50:35.140\n because he did things?\n\n1:50:35.620 --> 1:50:38.980\n I think it's because it's not, I think I know it's because he did things.\n\n1:50:38.980 --> 1:50:43.060\n Now, if I'm going to start punishing thought crime, I, I'm going to have to\n\n1:50:43.060 --> 1:50:44.340\n start punishing thought crime.\n\n1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:45.860\n And that's a terrifying concept.\n\n1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.380\n Even if I'm right about the certain, about the objectively correct about the\n\n1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:53.220\n things that I decide to call out of bounds, who put me in charge and made me\n\n1:50:53.220 --> 1:50:58.420\n arbiter of good taste and how long until I did it, did it, did it, did it, did it\n\n1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:01.940\n long until I decide that something else is, is out of bounds.\n\n1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:04.980\n It's, it's always a sliding scale or it's always a sliding standard.\n\n1:51:05.220 --> 1:51:09.620\n And I find that, that, you know, to be more of a concern than people doing\n\n1:51:09.620 --> 1:51:12.500\n crazy things, because I guess if you mentioned Alex Jones, you know, putting\n\n1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:16.260\n out ridiculous, ridiculous ideas, ridiculous theories, I think that most\n\n1:51:16.260 --> 1:51:18.580\n people don't look at Alex Jones as a credible person.\n\n1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:22.100\n Now I'm not going to pretend to be deeply read into all of his beliefs or the\n\n1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:23.220\n things that he's trying to peddle.\n\n1:51:23.220 --> 1:51:27.860\n Um, but there's plenty of things that are quasi mainstream that I think on\n\n1:51:27.860 --> 1:51:32.820\n with this side or that side that maybe not comparably ridiculous, but are, you\n\n1:51:32.820 --> 1:51:36.820\n know, particularly in hindsight or, you know, or we're not, or, or silly.\n\n1:51:37.140 --> 1:51:42.740\n And I guess, uh, the idea of, of getting a group of people together to decide\n\n1:51:42.740 --> 1:51:46.180\n what we're not going to tolerate is a very, very tricky thing.\n\n1:51:46.180 --> 1:51:51.700\n And I think that, you know, it reminds me of law or, you know, even, you\n\n1:51:51.700 --> 1:51:54.420\n know, religion when it gets to like, what are the things that we don't like?\n\n1:51:54.420 --> 1:51:56.420\n How do we feel about rape?\n\n1:51:56.420 --> 1:51:58.180\n It's like, no, under no circumstances.\n\n1:51:58.220 --> 1:52:00.180\n Is that an acceptable behavior murder?\n\n1:52:00.580 --> 1:52:01.860\n No, that's not acceptable behavior.\n\n1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:05.300\n Killing, I don't know, kind of depends on the situation.\n\n1:52:05.300 --> 1:52:06.100\n Are you at war?\n\n1:52:06.100 --> 1:52:06.980\n Were you justified?\n\n1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:08.340\n Were you acting in self defense?\n\n1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:09.300\n Okay.\n\n1:52:09.300 --> 1:52:14.660\n So it's not now murder is a specific type of killing the same way, you know, other\n\n1:52:14.660 --> 1:52:16.180\n things should be a specific type of something else.\n\n1:52:16.180 --> 1:52:17.700\n But I guess we, we draw the line of murder.\n\n1:52:17.700 --> 1:52:20.340\n We say, if you want to exist in our society, you can't do this.\n\n1:52:20.340 --> 1:52:21.460\n This cannot be done.\n\n1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:23.140\n And then we go theft.\n\n1:52:23.140 --> 1:52:24.900\n If someone said, Hey, I murdered that guy.\n\n1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:26.260\n Can you understand where I'm coming from?\n\n1:52:26.260 --> 1:52:27.460\n I might say, yeah, I'll hear you out.\n\n1:52:27.540 --> 1:52:30.740\n It doesn't mean that I think you're right, but I'm like, have you ever been wronged\n\n1:52:30.740 --> 1:52:33.460\n so deeply that you could imagine that you could kill someone?\n\n1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:36.020\n I'm like, no, I haven't, but I could conceptualize someone doing that.\n\n1:52:36.020 --> 1:52:37.460\n And I'm like, yeah, okay.\n\n1:52:37.460 --> 1:52:40.580\n And you still need to go, you still need to face, you know, criminal justice as we\n\n1:52:40.580 --> 1:52:42.740\n have it in our system, or at least that's how we've decided.\n\n1:52:43.300 --> 1:52:44.580\n Yeah, there's, it's interesting.\n\n1:52:44.580 --> 1:52:48.980\n You have to be able to like, there's, if you look at the history of discourse in\n\n1:52:48.980 --> 1:52:55.380\n this country, I think it's still true, but I'm not sure it's changed since 9 11 is,\n\n1:52:55.380 --> 1:53:02.180\n uh, it used to be impossible to criticize, um, a soldier.\n\n1:53:03.220 --> 1:53:05.140\n It was easier to criticize war.\n\n1:53:05.140 --> 1:53:09.940\n It was harder to criticize soldiers for allowing themselves to be the tools of war.\n\n1:53:10.260 --> 1:53:13.220\n I tend to be, maybe it's the Russian upbringing.\n\n1:53:13.220 --> 1:53:15.380\n It's the, it's the combat thing.\n\n1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:19.300\n I tend to romanticize war and soldiers.\n\n1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:26.420\n I see soldiers as heroes, but I've also heard people that not only say that soldiers\n\n1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:28.260\n are, uh, war is bad.\n\n1:53:28.740 --> 1:53:30.740\n They say soldiers are bad.\n\n1:53:31.620 --> 1:53:32.580\n What's their argument?\n\n1:53:33.060 --> 1:53:41.220\n It's, it's the kind of a libertarian view that they're basically slaves to evil, right?\n\n1:53:41.220 --> 1:53:49.700\n War is evil and they're, they're given, they are suspending their moral and ethical, like,\n\n1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:53.540\n as like duties as a human being to become the tools of evil.\n\n1:53:53.540 --> 1:53:55.060\n That's the sort of the argument.\n\n1:53:55.060 --> 1:54:01.780\n If you see war as evil, I mean, I think it's useful to hear that, but there's for a long\n\n1:54:02.500 --> 1:54:05.140\n part in history that was completely unacceptable.\n\n1:54:05.940 --> 1:54:08.020\n Same with abortion.\n\n1:54:08.020 --> 1:54:16.660\n If you see abortion as murder, I mean, if I classify it in that, if I put it in that,\n\n1:54:16.660 --> 1:54:23.220\n in that basket, it starts, we're living in the midst of like a genocide.\n\n1:54:25.220 --> 1:54:29.220\n Looked at from that perspective, could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion?\n\n1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:29.940\n You go, of course.\n\n1:54:29.940 --> 1:54:32.980\n Looked at from a different perspective, you say, I don't believe it to be murder.\n\n1:54:32.980 --> 1:54:34.340\n That's not how I see it.\n\n1:54:34.340 --> 1:54:37.780\n Then you go, oh, well, if that's the genesis of your, your thought process, then you're\n\n1:54:37.780 --> 1:54:38.340\n like, yeah, okay.\n\n1:54:38.340 --> 1:54:43.060\n Now, now I see how we can come to a different thing, but I guess we go, well, abortion is\n\n1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:44.100\n murder period.\n\n1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:47.140\n Therefore, if you support it, you support murder.\n\n1:54:47.140 --> 1:54:49.060\n That's a convenient way for me to tar you.\n\n1:54:49.060 --> 1:54:49.460\n Right.\n\n1:54:49.460 --> 1:54:52.420\n But I guess that's kind of coming back to the Alec Jones.\n\n1:54:52.420 --> 1:54:54.420\n I'm, I'm just a nuance.\n\n1:54:54.420 --> 1:54:58.100\n It's a, you have to have the nuance in these kinds of conversations and I have to be willing\n\n1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:00.420\n to have the conversation and I have to be willing to sit down.\n\n1:55:00.420 --> 1:55:05.940\n If I can't sit down across from like the most violently racist, angry, hypothetical internet,\n\n1:55:05.940 --> 1:55:10.020\n you know, conceived person that none of us have ever actually met in real life, but are\n\n1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:14.980\n hopefully not, you know, and go like, well, of course I believe that this person's wrong,\n\n1:55:14.980 --> 1:55:16.900\n but allow me to change, do my best.\n\n1:55:16.900 --> 1:55:19.860\n I'll hear them out and I'll go, no, I can go point by point and explain where this guy\n\n1:55:19.860 --> 1:55:23.620\n or this girl is wrong and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position where\n\n1:55:23.620 --> 1:55:27.700\n they will have better beliefs and they will like objectively better beliefs and beliefs\n\n1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:30.420\n that will, will, and they'll treat other people better.\n\n1:55:30.420 --> 1:55:32.020\n Why would I want to marginalize this person?\n\n1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:32.980\n I might not want to talk.\n\n1:55:32.980 --> 1:55:36.180\n I might not want to invite them to my barbecue if they're acting like a jerk all the time,\n\n1:55:36.180 --> 1:55:39.620\n but how could I, would it not make the world a better place if I'd hear them out and they\n\n1:55:39.620 --> 1:55:41.860\n go, look, if you're going to sit down and talk with me, we're going to have to have\n\n1:55:41.860 --> 1:55:42.660\n a discussion.\n\n1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.020\n I'll hear what you have to say.\n\n1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:50.020\n And if I can't, if I can't explain to someone why their ridiculous belief is wrong, then\n\n1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.500\n I might, I must not be so confident in my position.\n\n1:55:52.500 --> 1:55:54.580\n And I guess that's where I come back to the Alex Jones thing.\n\n1:55:54.580 --> 1:55:58.980\n As you mentioned, you know, with, with Bill Gates and, and you're much more familiar with,\n\n1:55:58.980 --> 1:56:02.660\n with the specifics of all the good that he's done, but you know, again, he's been an unbelievable\n\n1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:04.660\n force for good, you know, in this world.\n\n1:56:05.380 --> 1:56:11.380\n You can list A, B, C, D things that the man has, has done, that his foundation has done\n\n1:56:11.380 --> 1:56:13.220\n and, you know, positive things.\n\n1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:18.740\n And then the other people could speculate about ridiculous, crazy levels of, of evil,\n\n1:56:18.740 --> 1:56:21.140\n but you can't produce any evidence for that sort of thing.\n\n1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:23.780\n Because if you could, the man will find himself in some trouble, you know?\n\n1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:29.780\n And anyway, I guess what I would, would say is that why you can't force me to accept the\n\n1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:33.140\n truth the same way you could write down two plus two equals four on a piece of paper and\n\n1:56:33.140 --> 1:56:33.940\n show me how it works.\n\n1:56:33.940 --> 1:56:36.500\n And I could say, no, but that doesn't make it not true.\n\n1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:38.980\n And you've still given yourself an opportunity to present your case.\n\n1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:40.260\n You've presented it to me.\n\n1:56:40.260 --> 1:56:44.420\n And you've also, for anyone listening and watching, you know, you've been able to critically\n\n1:56:45.060 --> 1:56:48.980\n assess what's gone on, you know, or critically address back and forth, you know, kind of\n\n1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.100\n the, the discourse.\n\n1:56:50.100 --> 1:56:52.500\n And I think that you almost, you're making your case for the public.\n\n1:56:52.500 --> 1:56:57.860\n So I guess like, you know, when it comes to just never not engaging with these people,\n\n1:56:57.860 --> 1:56:59.220\n that seems to me to be cowardly.\n\n1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:02.900\n And I think that that's a, something that we're seeing in society right now, I think\n\n1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:06.820\n we're seeing a crisis of courage in society all over the place.\n\n1:57:06.820 --> 1:57:09.140\n And I think that's where we're seeing poor leadership.\n\n1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:13.620\n I think we're seeing understandable things happening everywhere, but we need stronger\n\n1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:18.180\n voices and stronger, stronger beliefs that have a conviction and are willing to engage\n\n1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:22.020\n with others, not just turning into a shouting contest and not, I didn't win because there's\n\n1:57:22.020 --> 1:57:22.420\n more of me.\n\n1:57:22.420 --> 1:57:23.940\n Oh, I voted, I outvoted you.\n\n1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:24.820\n That's nice too.\n\n1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:26.260\n But that's a stand in for bullets.\n\n1:57:26.260 --> 1:57:27.940\n That's saying I won because there's more of me.\n\n1:57:27.940 --> 1:57:32.260\n That doesn't mean that I'm right because plenty of horrible and unpopular now things have\n\n1:57:32.260 --> 1:57:35.460\n been very, very deeply popular in the past and would have won a popular vote.\n\n1:57:35.460 --> 1:57:36.820\n Does that make them right?\n\n1:57:36.820 --> 1:57:38.180\n I'd say clearly not.\n\n1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:42.420\n So I guess you'd hope that we engage with these people and that you can do your best\n\n1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:45.540\n to bring them over to a more reasonable position if you believe that you have one.\n\n1:57:45.540 --> 1:57:47.540\n And if you can't, well, at least you made the effort.\n\n1:57:47.540 --> 1:57:50.100\n And I think that that's something where martial arts shows the value.\n\n1:57:50.100 --> 1:57:52.180\n It's like, do you know if you're going to go win your next fight?\n\n1:57:52.180 --> 1:57:53.460\n I'm like, I have no idea.\n\n1:57:53.460 --> 1:57:58.420\n I will proceed forward with full effort and I will fight with dignity.\n\n1:57:58.420 --> 1:58:02.500\n I'll fight with honor and I'll fight with courage and I'll use everything that I have\n\n1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:05.300\n and I will play within the bounds of the game and that's that.\n\n1:58:05.300 --> 1:58:06.660\n And the result will be what it'll be.\n\n1:58:06.660 --> 1:58:09.860\n But I'll walk into and out of that ring with my head held high because I will know that\n\n1:58:09.860 --> 1:58:10.580\n I did my part.\n\n1:58:10.580 --> 1:58:11.620\n I did my job.\n\n1:58:11.620 --> 1:58:14.500\n The outcome, the specific outcome is not in my control.\n\n1:58:14.500 --> 1:58:16.340\n It's just strongly in my influence.\n\n1:58:16.340 --> 1:58:20.340\n And I think that that's something that helped me, that martial arts has taught me because\n\n1:58:20.340 --> 1:58:25.140\n other times, even when I was successful or unsuccessful, I would focus on if I won, I\n\n1:58:25.140 --> 1:58:26.260\n won, therefore I'm good.\n\n1:58:26.260 --> 1:58:27.540\n I lost, therefore I'm bad.\n\n1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:31.460\n This other guy won or lost, therefore, as opposed to evaluating their method.\n\n1:58:31.460 --> 1:58:35.300\n And I think it's so easy when we're taking a bird's eye view of things to not evaluate\n\n1:58:35.300 --> 1:58:36.340\n how someone's doing things.\n\n1:58:36.340 --> 1:58:38.020\n You're not evaluating my process.\n\n1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:39.460\n You're simply evaluating my outcome.\n\n1:58:39.460 --> 1:58:42.740\n And I could have stumbled into something very, very good or very, very bad.\n\n1:58:42.740 --> 1:58:44.660\n And we can look back and I think that's the value of history.\n\n1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:47.780\n I mean, I don't mean to get on my dang high horse, but it's like this value of history\n\n1:58:47.780 --> 1:58:51.700\n is we can see the unbroken chain or the chain of events that led us somewhere.\n\n1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:55.700\n And then only with the eyes of history can we truly evaluate things unless we're in\n\n1:58:55.700 --> 1:58:57.380\n the room watching it happen.\n\n1:58:57.380 --> 1:59:02.820\n And I guess that's, again, where we start to go most of the big, bad, scary things that\n\n1:59:02.820 --> 1:59:08.420\n have happened in history that are done particularly on an industrial scale, which implies governmental\n\n1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:12.980\n power and things like that or the equivalent, involve groups of people getting together\n\n1:59:12.980 --> 1:59:16.100\n and going, hey, we're not going to deal with that guy, giant groups of people.\n\n1:59:16.100 --> 1:59:20.100\n So maybe we're right this time, but maybe we're wrong next time.\n\n1:59:20.100 --> 1:59:22.980\n And I guess I would be back to the Gandalf putting on the one ring.\n\n1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:26.820\n I would be very, very hesitant, even if we thought we were in the right to simply try\n\n1:59:26.820 --> 1:59:30.180\n to try to marginalize just on general principle.\n\n1:59:30.180 --> 1:59:33.860\n Even people like Alex Jones, whom on their face are pretty ridiculous.\n\n1:59:33.860 --> 1:59:36.740\n Like you said, you should sit down with Adolf Hitler and talk to the man.\n\n1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:44.420\n I agree with you to play a little devil's advocate is Alex Jones might be a bad example.\n\n1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:48.740\n But if we look at, because he has a face, he is a human, he's a real person.\n\n1:59:48.740 --> 1:59:54.340\n There's also trolls on the internet for Chan.\n\n1:59:55.380 --> 2:00:01.380\n The worry I have with those folks is that, and there might be parallels to martial arts\n\n2:00:01.380 --> 2:00:08.500\n is they practice guerrilla warfare, meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive at the truth.\n\n2:00:09.220 --> 2:00:13.940\n They just always want to cut at the ankles of the powerful.\n\n2:00:13.940 --> 2:00:17.460\n Like they want to always break down the powerful.\n\n2:00:17.460 --> 2:00:22.580\n And even if they, I mean, it's, they turn everything into a game.\n\n2:00:22.580 --> 2:00:25.940\n So they let's see if we can make the world.\n\n2:00:26.660 --> 2:00:30.580\n Let's see if we can make a trend that Bill Gates is a pedophile, right?\n\n2:00:30.580 --> 2:00:31.620\n They make it into a game.\n\n2:00:31.620 --> 2:00:33.460\n They get excited about this game.\n\n2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:34.820\n They see the powerful.\n\n2:00:34.820 --> 2:00:39.220\n Let's see if we can convince that, like, who is the most positive person we can think of.\n\n2:00:39.220 --> 2:00:41.300\n Let's see if we can turn them into evil.\n\n2:00:41.300 --> 2:00:47.700\n And they've tried that with like everybody and it seems to stick and they're good at it.\n\n2:00:47.700 --> 2:00:54.420\n And some would argue, whatever you think about our current president, that he has some elements\n\n2:00:54.420 --> 2:01:00.900\n of that, which is he's figured out whatever this music of social discourse that's going on,\n\n2:01:00.900 --> 2:01:07.940\n he's figured out how to always troll the mainstream flow of consciousness.\n\n2:01:07.940 --> 2:01:09.300\n That's the media.\n\n2:01:09.300 --> 2:01:13.780\n He always kind of says stuff that annoys a very large number of people.\n\n2:01:13.780 --> 2:01:19.460\n And he enjoys that because it's like taking the powerful, taking the way things were before.\n\n2:01:19.460 --> 2:01:23.940\n And he like shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing, almost on purpose or\n\n2:01:23.940 --> 2:01:25.540\n instinctually and so on.\n\n2:01:25.540 --> 2:01:36.900\n The problem I have with that is that doesn't, the powerful thing there is it brings those\n\n2:01:36.900 --> 2:01:38.020\n in power down a notch.\n\n2:01:38.020 --> 2:01:38.980\n That's a great thing.\n\n2:01:38.980 --> 2:01:46.180\n The negative thing is it doesn't push us closer to a nuanced, careful, rigorous discourse\n\n2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:47.620\n towards truth.\n\n2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:51.140\n It's like showing up to a party and just like starting to yell.\n\n2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:54.100\n It doesn't create a good conversation.\n\n2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:59.140\n It just makes everything into a game where truth doesn't even seem like a thing we can\n\n2:01:59.140 --> 2:02:01.220\n even hope to achieve.\n\n2:02:01.220 --> 2:02:02.020\n That makes sense.\n\n2:02:02.020 --> 2:02:04.740\n And I guess, as you mentioned, we'll come back to another movie because I don't do books\n\n2:02:04.740 --> 2:02:05.380\n and do movies.\n\n2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:07.380\n Some people just want to watch the world burn, right?\n\n2:02:07.380 --> 2:02:13.940\n And I guess there's, that's a creepy, creepy kind of urge that some people have.\n\n2:02:13.940 --> 2:02:16.660\n And then also is some people you're like, hey, would you like to throw a brick through\n\n2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:17.460\n that glass window?\n\n2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:19.060\n You're like, yeah, sure.\n\n2:02:19.060 --> 2:02:23.860\n Like, no, I'm not going to do that because I think about what's going to occur.\n\n2:02:23.860 --> 2:02:27.060\n Like something's going to be hurt, someone's property not going to do it versus, hey, you\n\n2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:27.860\n want to see what will happen?\n\n2:02:27.860 --> 2:02:28.740\n Like, yeah, sure.\n\n2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:33.540\n Kids are always like, I have my son, he grabs Spider Man and drops him on the table.\n\n2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:34.500\n Spider Man fell.\n\n2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:35.940\n Spider Man didn't fall, Sean.\n\n2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:39.780\n Like, he dropped him, you knocked him off the table and he'll grin.\n\n2:02:39.780 --> 2:02:46.340\n And basically, it's an interesting thing, like you said, that these people are appealing\n\n2:02:46.340 --> 2:02:52.420\n to and also almost like the little dog factor of like people do want to watch the powerful\n\n2:02:52.420 --> 2:02:55.220\n get taken down a notch for all the good and the not good of that.\n\n2:02:55.220 --> 2:02:59.940\n Just plenty of people, it seems to me, that have found their way to incredibly high positions.\n\n2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:04.580\n Some have just found themselves there and many, many, many, many, many people, men and\n\n2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.100\n women of all backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard.\n\n2:03:08.100 --> 2:03:11.300\n And yeah, of course, there's luck and there's luck into everything.\n\n2:03:11.300 --> 2:03:16.260\n LeBron James, in spite of being the best basketball player on God's green earth, is fortunate\n\n2:03:16.260 --> 2:03:17.780\n that he didn't get hit by a car.\n\n2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:22.580\n It's fortunate he didn't tear his knee, but thankfully, we get to see all these things.\n\n2:03:22.580 --> 2:03:31.140\n But I guess if people don't have any skin in the game, you never know what they're going\n\n2:03:31.140 --> 2:03:31.380\n to do.\n\n2:03:31.380 --> 2:03:33.140\n And I think that's the problem with the internet.\n\n2:03:33.140 --> 2:03:36.340\n You know, that people get to be nameless, be faceless.\n\n2:03:36.340 --> 2:03:39.300\n That's why guerrilla fighters are outside of the bounds of war.\n\n2:03:39.300 --> 2:03:40.820\n Like you don't have a uniform on.\n\n2:03:40.820 --> 2:03:42.340\n Like, I don't know who you're from.\n\n2:03:42.340 --> 2:03:46.740\n You don't get the same treatment that a soldier gets for MP.\n\n2:03:46.740 --> 2:03:47.540\n Well, that's crazy.\n\n2:03:47.540 --> 2:03:52.260\n Actually, there's reasons for this, because otherwise people are able to assail things\n\n2:03:52.260 --> 2:03:55.220\n and there's no one responsible.\n\n2:03:55.220 --> 2:03:57.540\n There's no way to go and say, hey, where did this come from?\n\n2:03:57.540 --> 2:03:58.340\n What's the root of this?\n\n2:03:58.340 --> 2:03:59.700\n How can I address this?\n\n2:03:59.700 --> 2:04:01.940\n And I think that's the problem of the internet, the problem of Twitter.\n\n2:04:01.940 --> 2:04:03.300\n There's a problem in places like 4chan.\n\n2:04:03.300 --> 2:04:06.580\n I wouldn't mind seeing that type of stuff go away, if I'm frank.\n\n2:04:06.580 --> 2:04:11.540\n But that's not the same thing as people with a face, people who are willing to stand there\n\n2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:13.540\n and say, hi, my name is so and so.\n\n2:04:13.540 --> 2:04:16.420\n Even if I have ridiculous beliefs, hopefully people will hear me out.\n\n2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:18.260\n And then if I'm wrong, educate me.\n\n2:04:18.260 --> 2:04:24.340\n But I guess you hope that the real, I guess, in my mind, antidote to all of this silliness\n\n2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:25.300\n is education.\n\n2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:30.580\n And I think that that's something that we're critical thinking is not necessarily.\n\n2:04:30.580 --> 2:04:33.220\n I went to school in America, and I feel very fortunate.\n\n2:04:33.220 --> 2:04:36.820\n But critical thinking is not something that's focused on.\n\n2:04:36.820 --> 2:04:37.700\n I mean, it's tough.\n\n2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:39.220\n It's almost like talking about jujitsu.\n\n2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:41.460\n It's tough to teach critical thinking when I don't know any words.\n\n2:04:41.460 --> 2:04:42.500\n You have to teach me techniques.\n\n2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:44.100\n You can't teach me to be an artist.\n\n2:04:44.100 --> 2:04:47.220\n But recognize that the techniques are the beginning, not the end.\n\n2:04:47.220 --> 2:04:51.940\n Ultimately, it's the artistry that we are searching for, not just the science or the\n\n2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:53.060\n biro memorization.\n\n2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:58.420\n And I guess you'd hope that people's ability to think critically and recognize that majority\n\n2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:01.940\n rule or whoever's loudest does not mean that they're right by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:02.740\n And we don't appeal to that.\n\n2:05:02.740 --> 2:05:03.620\n And we don't bow to that.\n\n2:05:04.660 --> 2:05:09.140\n We'll help them to help inoculate them against the ridiculous things that come out of these\n\n2:05:09.140 --> 2:05:12.660\n places, these dark places that are objectively not great.\n\n2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:19.300\n But I guess all circling back, even if we swatted these bad things out of existence\n\n2:05:19.300 --> 2:05:25.380\n right now, we've got to be very, very careful doing that because it's who's doing the swatting.\n\n2:05:25.380 --> 2:05:28.980\n This political group that's in power right now, the people that support our current president\n\n2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:30.260\n would maybe feel a certain way.\n\n2:05:30.260 --> 2:05:34.260\n The people that support another option would feel differently as to what exactly defines\n\n2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:34.820\n toxic.\n\n2:05:34.820 --> 2:05:38.980\n And I guess that's what gives me pause.\n\n2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:39.780\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:39.780 --> 2:05:41.380\n But also the grace thing.\n\n2:05:41.380 --> 2:05:48.660\n I tend to believe that the technology, you said education, but the platforms we use like\n\n2:05:48.660 --> 2:05:54.180\n Twitter and Reddit and all these platforms have a role to play to teach us grace.\n\n2:05:54.180 --> 2:06:03.460\n Meaning they should help us incentivize the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real\n\n2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:03.940\n life.\n\n2:06:03.940 --> 2:06:07.460\n Like being a dick in real life is not incentivized.\n\n2:06:07.460 --> 2:06:09.380\n Like one on one interaction.\n\n2:06:09.380 --> 2:06:14.660\n Like there's cases where it is, but usually being kind to each other is incentivized.\n\n2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:16.580\n On the internet, it's not.\n\n2:06:16.580 --> 2:06:22.180\n Like you get likes for mocking people in a funny, in a humorous way.\n\n2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:24.980\n And it can be dark kind of mocking, depending on the community.\n\n2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:27.460\n You can go to the appearance.\n\n2:06:27.460 --> 2:06:32.420\n If somebody is a little fat or a little too skinny, you can comment on their appearance,\n\n2:06:32.420 --> 2:06:36.500\n the hair, the way the hair looks, like the appearance stuff.\n\n2:06:36.500 --> 2:06:43.620\n It could be on the people comment all the time on the level of eloquence of my speech.\n\n2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:45.460\n Go fuck yourself.\n\n2:06:45.460 --> 2:06:46.420\n I like it.\n\n2:06:46.420 --> 2:06:50.420\n It's creepy though watching previously, like this used to be low brow though.\n\n2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:53.700\n Like people doing this type of stuff, it's creepy watching like our political figures\n\n2:06:53.700 --> 2:06:55.540\n get into this type of game.\n\n2:06:56.180 --> 2:06:56.820\n Yes.\n\n2:06:56.820 --> 2:07:00.180\n But again, it's a little bit refreshing, right?\n\n2:07:00.180 --> 2:07:09.460\n It's the, my hope with Donald Trump was, is that he would shake up the people who wear\n\n2:07:09.460 --> 2:07:09.940\n suits.\n\n2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:16.100\n Usually the, like if you're from DC, I remember like showing up, I actually didn't wear what\n\n2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:21.540\n I usually wear in DC cause I was like, everybody's wearing a suit and tie when I was like giving\n\n2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:22.340\n talks and stuff.\n\n2:07:22.340 --> 2:07:24.500\n Except for Mudge, who wears jeans and a t shirt.\n\n2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:25.460\n Mudge doesn't give a damn.\n\n2:07:25.460 --> 2:07:28.900\n Mudge is a forever renegade.\n\n2:07:28.900 --> 2:07:34.260\n But I don't even remember what, oh yeah.\n\n2:07:34.260 --> 2:07:40.900\n So my hope with Trump was that he would shake up that system to say like, to inject new\n\n2:07:40.900 --> 2:07:43.060\n ideas, to inject new energy.\n\n2:07:43.060 --> 2:07:49.300\n Of course, the way it turned out is different, but like there's, it turns out that you might\n\n2:07:49.300 --> 2:07:54.900\n want to have somebody who's like an Andrew Yang type character who is full of ideas that\n\n2:07:54.900 --> 2:08:01.700\n are very different and inject the energy, new energy into the system through youthful\n\n2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:09.300\n new ideas versus through the troll that like, that's very good at sort of mocking and like\n\n2:08:09.300 --> 2:08:12.980\n playing outside the rules of the game.\n\n2:08:12.980 --> 2:08:20.020\n But Trump did reveal powerfully, I don't know what to think of it, that it's just a game\n\n2:08:20.020 --> 2:08:22.260\n and you don't have to play by the rules.\n\n2:08:22.260 --> 2:08:25.620\n That's both inspiring and dark.\n\n2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:26.900\n Deeply depressing, right?\n\n2:08:26.900 --> 2:08:28.980\n Yeah, and I don't know what to do with it.\n\n2:08:28.980 --> 2:08:34.500\n I don't, I mean the same, I'm not drawing parallels, not drawing parallels between our\n\n2:08:34.500 --> 2:08:41.940\n president and Adolf Hitler, but it's certainly, and there's a lot of, in history, a lot of\n\n2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:47.060\n positive and a lot of negative things happen when charismatic leaders realize they don't\n\n2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:48.100\n have to play by the rules.\n\n2:08:49.380 --> 2:08:50.580\n You can just flip the table.\n\n2:08:50.580 --> 2:08:55.140\n It's that Kevin Spacey show.\n\n2:08:55.140 --> 2:08:55.700\n House of Cards.\n\n2:08:55.700 --> 2:08:58.420\n House of Cards, where you just flip the table or whatever.\n\n2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.420\n You don't have to play by the rules of the chess game.\n\n2:09:00.420 --> 2:09:01.860\n You can flip the table.\n\n2:09:01.860 --> 2:09:04.580\n One wonders if that's always been done in private, you know?\n\n2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:09.060\n I guess, because that's, I mean, even look, obviously, the United States is a republic,\n\n2:09:09.060 --> 2:09:14.900\n but we had Bush, then we had Clinton, then we had more Bush, then we had President Obama,\n\n2:09:14.900 --> 2:09:16.900\n then we were about to have another Clinton.\n\n2:09:16.900 --> 2:09:18.260\n That's fairly creepy.\n\n2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:18.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:19.140 --> 2:09:20.340\n Even on its own.\n\n2:09:20.340 --> 2:09:26.580\n But now we added another, I mean, I'm sure we'll have a generation of Trumps now.\n\n2:09:26.580 --> 2:09:27.080\n Gee.\n\n2:09:27.080 --> 2:09:35.000\n I'm Russian, so I think we humans like kings still and queens.\n\n2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:41.000\n There's something, we're attracted to the thing we talked about, coaches.\n\n2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.560\n There's something in us that longs towards that authoritarian control.\n\n2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:53.080\n One of the beautiful things about America, the Second Amendment, is we also like individual\n\n2:09:53.080 --> 2:09:53.480\n freedom.\n\n2:09:53.480 --> 2:09:59.320\n That's one of the unique aspects at the founding of this country and still, and for me, is\n\n2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:08.040\n the beacon of hope that somehow there's the fire of freedom burns in like that Texas feel.\n\n2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:10.440\n That gives me hope.\n\n2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:17.960\n The FU energy that revolts against the power, which as we discussed, power corrupts and\n\n2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:25.880\n ultimately leads to degradation of whoever's ruling the people.\n\n2:10:25.880 --> 2:10:26.840\n It's interesting though.\n\n2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:30.440\n It seems to me, maybe I'm just, I don't know if I'm reading this properly when I see it,\n\n2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:37.640\n but it seems to me that, like you said, that flip the bird, I'm going to do me within reason.\n\n2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:43.800\n As long as I'm not hurting you, is idea that very much, at least in my mind, defines the\n\n2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:48.600\n American ideal or at least part of the consciousness of the United States is under attack to a\n\n2:10:48.600 --> 2:10:49.240\n certain extent.\n\n2:10:50.600 --> 2:10:58.600\n If only I can think to maybe a generation behind us, it's becoming more collectivist\n\n2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:01.480\n for all the good and also the not good of that.\n\n2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:08.600\n And it's not in terms of policy at this point, but just in terms of consciousness.\n\n2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:10.920\n And I wonder if that's an internet thing.\n\n2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:14.360\n People are more in touch with one another than they've, as far as I can tell, have ever\n\n2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:16.520\n been, or at least more than in my lifetime.\n\n2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:20.760\n And the rest of the world seems much closer than it did.\n\n2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:23.480\n Living in Virginia, California seems very far away.\n\n2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:25.080\n Being on the internet, it's just right there.\n\n2:11:25.080 --> 2:11:25.800\n I can hear about it.\n\n2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:26.840\n I can see it.\n\n2:11:26.840 --> 2:11:29.080\n I can interact with people from there.\n\n2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:37.800\n I remember being in Tennessee at one time and reading about events taking place in the\n\n2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:38.520\n Middle East.\n\n2:11:38.520 --> 2:11:40.520\n And that just seemed like a mile away.\n\n2:11:40.520 --> 2:11:43.160\n It seemed like an unbelievably far distance.\n\n2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:45.800\n And then another time when you're in DC, you just feel like, oh, you read about something\n\n2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:46.520\n happening in Paris.\n\n2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:51.160\n And it just feels like it's just right around the corner because DC is a seat of power where\n\n2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:52.520\n things are just occurring all the time.\n\n2:11:52.520 --> 2:12:01.000\n And I guess you wonder about that's where I come back to the group decisions to not\n\n2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000\n listen to this person or to cancel this.\n\n2:12:03.800 --> 2:12:08.280\n We all, the moral majority, shall do the following as opposed to as long as you're not hurting\n\n2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:12.760\n me and as long as you're not hurting anyone else, I have to let you do, I have to let\n\n2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:14.040\n you be on general principle.\n\n2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.040\n Even if I don't like you, I'm very free to not like you.\n\n2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:20.760\n I'm free to speak out against you, but I'm not, it is not within my right or, and not\n\n2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:21.080\n with it.\n\n2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:25.640\n And it's not, I would not be right to attempt to attack you.\n\n2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:29.560\n And that is an interesting thing though, when we see words being redefined or words being\n\n2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:33.640\n defined, whether it's toxicity, whether it's violence, if I think that what you're saying\n\n2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:39.320\n is your speech is by itself a violence or a precursor to violence, I'm justified in\n\n2:12:39.320 --> 2:12:40.360\n doing all sorts of things.\n\n2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:47.000\n And that creeps me out significantly because again, even if it ends up being pointed in\n\n2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:49.880\n a good direction initially, it's only a matter of time.\n\n2:12:49.880 --> 2:12:54.840\n And actually that brings me to another, yeah, I got all day.\n\n2:12:54.840 --> 2:12:57.080\n How much are they paying you?\n\n2:12:57.080 --> 2:13:02.920\n But we about say the Frank Herbert estate, not enough frankly, let's see.\n\n2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:05.160\n And how many books are there in Dune?\n\n2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:06.200\n That's a Jen question.\n\n2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:08.680\n You're also a fan of Dune?\n\n2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:15.240\n I read the whole series, but not a couple of the, I read all the prequels as well with\n\n2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:16.520\n the exception of a couple.\n\n2:13:16.520 --> 2:13:18.680\n Is there a book one for Dune?\n\n2:13:18.680 --> 2:13:20.520\n Dune would be book one.\n\n2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:25.320\n And even the prequels, it's still all better if you start, like I read Dune and then read\n\n2:13:25.320 --> 2:13:27.000\n the original, what is it?\n\n2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:27.480\n Six.\n\n2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:29.400\n And then I went back and started to read some of the books.\n\n2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:34.040\n Just like watching Star Wars, you want to start episode four or whatever?\n\n2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:35.080\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:39.720\n That's the move and then stop at six, call it a day, watch The Mandalorian.\n\n2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:42.520\n Well, I thought you're not walking back here.\n\n2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:43.960\n No, I like The Mandalorian.\n\n2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:44.920\n No, it's not The Mandalorian.\n\n2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:45.800\n That is what I said.\n\n2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.720\n I was told that I was heartless for not liking Baby Yoda, who I...\n\n2:13:49.720 --> 2:13:54.120\n We don't talk about a couple of the movies, not including The Mandalorian.\n\n2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:55.480\n The Mandalorian is fine.\n\n2:13:55.480 --> 2:13:58.280\n It's the more recent movies that we don't like to talk about.\n\n2:13:58.280 --> 2:13:59.880\n Oh, the...\n\n2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:00.840\n What's his name?\n\n2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:01.640\n The goofy guy.\n\n2:14:02.280 --> 2:14:03.000\n Ryan.\n\n2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:03.480\n No, no.\n\n2:14:04.280 --> 2:14:06.120\n No, the creature, the goofy creature with the...\n\n2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:06.680\n Jar Jar?\n\n2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:07.560\n Yeah, Jar Jar.\n\n2:14:07.560 --> 2:14:12.600\n Do you ever see the Jar Jar Binks is actually like the Dark Lord of the Sith theory?\n\n2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:16.760\n That fixed the whole initial trilogy where he's goofing around and making it all the\n\n2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:17.560\n way through battles.\n\n2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:21.000\n And when you're like, wait a minute, he oops his way, walks over to a pool, does a triple\n\n2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:24.600\n backflip, falls in, you're like, it's just bizarre that you...\n\n2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:27.880\n This is the Alex Jones theory of Star Wars.\n\n2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:29.400\n He's actually running everything.\n\n2:14:29.400 --> 2:14:34.040\n He was the one that actually was like, hey, we should vote in Chancellor Palpatine, or\n\n2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:37.000\n Senator Palpatine, right before they put Jar Jar in charge.\n\n2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:38.600\n First off, what did they think was gonna happen?\n\n2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.400\n And second off, I just think that'd be great.\n\n2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:43.960\n You're like, oops, oh man, I guess he's the emperor now.\n\n2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:44.840\n That would have been great.\n\n2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:49.960\n But actually, to the cancel and all the other stuff, again, you'd hope that it gives pause.\n\n2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:51.880\n And I think about this for fighting, because a lot of times...\n\n2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:57.320\n I'll use this as an example, people fight fans in UFC, they love people that run out\n\n2:14:57.320 --> 2:14:58.600\n and try to murder each other.\n\n2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:01.560\n And it's entertaining, and it's super entertaining.\n\n2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:05.160\n But Floyd Mayweather doesn't resonate with people as much.\n\n2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:06.040\n It's like people start...\n\n2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:07.880\n I remember the time when Floyd was not as popular.\n\n2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:11.320\n Now people think people love Floyd because he's 50 and oh Floyd.\n\n2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:15.480\n And oh man, and finally he had so much success that we all can't help but recognize the man's\n\n2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:16.680\n genius and greatness.\n\n2:15:16.680 --> 2:15:19.320\n But prior to that, oh, he's boring, he's this, he's that.\n\n2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:23.880\n He fights with his circumspect, he's cautious, he's pressing.\n\n2:15:23.880 --> 2:15:26.600\n He's intelligent, deeply intelligent.\n\n2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:30.920\n And when you watch people go out and try to murder each other, you can flip a coin 100\n\n2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:35.640\n times and you could be lucky enough to get 100 heads, but it's still a coin flip.\n\n2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:40.120\n And I think that that's what's going on all the time is people are getting an outcome\n\n2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:42.600\n that they want, but it wasn't a well thought out situation.\n\n2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:46.360\n That's why you'll win by five in a row by knockout and then lose three in a row.\n\n2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:48.040\n And then people will go, well, what happened to that guy?\n\n2:15:48.040 --> 2:15:49.000\n He used to be so great.\n\n2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000\n And you're like, no, he's doing what he's always been doing.\n\n2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:54.920\n It's just, it was getting great outcomes on a coin flip prior, and it's getting negative\n\n2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:56.520\n outcomes on a coin flip now.\n\n2:15:56.520 --> 2:16:03.320\n But I guess what I would say is it watches, it's interesting watching, I guess, societal\n\n2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:08.120\n beliefs become such a thing that we're almost adopting on a religious level if we're not\n\n2:16:08.120 --> 2:16:08.920\n careful.\n\n2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:13.400\n If when I say religious level, I mean like pan life, like this is guiding all of my\n\n2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:15.160\n choices for all the good and the bad of that.\n\n2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:18.600\n And this is a Dune quote is, when religion and politics travel in the same cart, the\n\n2:16:18.600 --> 2:16:21.000\n writers believe that nothing can stand in their way.\n\n2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.280\n Their movements become headlong faster and faster and faster.\n\n2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:28.200\n They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget that the precipice does not show itself\n\n2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:30.360\n to the man in the blind rush until it's too late.\n\n2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:33.480\n And I think that that's, again, the pause.\n\n2:16:33.480 --> 2:16:36.360\n We go, oh man, thank goodness we have this guy that wants to rebuild Germany.\n\n2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:37.720\n He'll put us back where we need to be.\n\n2:16:38.600 --> 2:16:45.160\n And you stop questioning your own judgment, your own, you stop thinking essentially.\n\n2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:45.320\n Right.\n\n2:16:45.320 --> 2:16:47.000\n I'm not allowed to question this.\n\n2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:47.880\n Of course this is correct.\n\n2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:49.320\n Of course, of course I'm right.\n\n2:16:49.320 --> 2:16:50.440\n I intended to do right.\n\n2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:52.120\n So of course my actions are correct.\n\n2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:55.960\n I mean, how many times have any of us intended to do something helpful and ended up doing\n\n2:16:55.960 --> 2:16:56.520\n something less?\n\n2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:01.720\n And plenty of people who intend to do harm could by accident do something decent.\n\n2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:07.640\n And I guess it's, I'm not saying anything terribly, terribly insightful, but it's just\n\n2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:10.600\n one of those where it's hard to say in the moment.\n\n2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:14.680\n And that's where you hopefully caution, you would counsel some degree of caution.\n\n2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:20.680\n And that's what worries me with people deciding that we're all so right about this or we're\n\n2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:25.800\n all so right about that and attempting to rather than win the argument, silence the\n\n2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:28.040\n counter argument, no matter how crazy it may seem.\n\n2:17:28.600 --> 2:17:31.800\n Because I just think that that idea, even when it's pointed in a good direction initially,\n\n2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:32.840\n it's only a matter of time.\n\n2:17:34.120 --> 2:17:38.760\n You're amongst many things, a Jiu Jitsu black belt.\n\n2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:44.920\n One of the things that people are really curious about white belts and blue belts in Jiu Jitsu,\n\n2:17:44.920 --> 2:17:50.440\n but also people haven't tried the art is what does it take to be a Jiu Jitsu black belt?\n\n2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:54.840\n I think that, you know, everyone's journey is a little bit different, but the one thing\n\n2:17:54.840 --> 2:18:00.920\n that the, it was a Calvin Coolidge quote, you know, determination, persistence is the\n\n2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:03.480\n only thing that will win in the end.\n\n2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:05.080\n It will always win in the end.\n\n2:18:05.080 --> 2:18:10.200\n Not brilliance, not toughness, not education, it's persistence.\n\n2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.160\n And I think that having the belief that no matter what happens to me, I will proceed\n\n2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:19.240\n forward and I will figure out how to make this happen, hell or high water, I think is\n\n2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.880\n the one thing that ties together all of the people that I've ever met that made it through\n\n2:18:23.880 --> 2:18:25.880\n whatever it was that they were going through.\n\n2:18:25.880 --> 2:18:31.000\n Because, you know, sometimes you can get lucky and you can have an easy time or and that\n\n2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:32.760\n luck could be you had a good situation.\n\n2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:35.720\n It could be, I mean, like in the obvious sense of like where you're living, where you're\n\n2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:39.640\n training, what's going on, you had a good situation, you're unbelievably athletic.\n\n2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:43.320\n Oh, you're going to be an astronaut, you're brilliant and an Olympic athlete, you know,\n\n2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:45.240\n like, well, that's a fantastic situation.\n\n2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:48.120\n You know, you won the genetic lottery and I'm sure you worked hard as well, but you\n\n2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:49.800\n also won the genetic lottery.\n\n2:18:49.800 --> 2:18:55.080\n It's a determination is the one thing, though, because that person could have a very easy\n\n2:18:55.080 --> 2:18:57.240\n go of it initially and then tear their knee.\n\n2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:01.720\n And then they're no longer the superhuman physical specimen that they were.\n\n2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:04.520\n The only thing that will keep them going is persistence.\n\n2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:09.800\n And I think that that I would just say that persistence to say I'll just put one foot\n\n2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:10.600\n in front of the other.\n\n2:19:10.600 --> 2:19:15.080\n And sometimes I can see the path ahead and sometimes it's beyond my vision, but I will\n\n2:19:15.080 --> 2:19:15.960\n not stop.\n\n2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:18.440\n I may even slow down, but I won't stop.\n\n2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:22.680\n And that's the only thing that I can say that I've seen tie everyone together because there's\n\n2:19:22.680 --> 2:19:26.440\n so many ways to the top of any mountain and there's so many different personalities and\n\n2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:28.200\n skills and backgrounds involved.\n\n2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:31.720\n But everyone, everyone carries on.\n\n2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:35.400\n So at the core, the foundational advice is just don't quit.\n\n2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:36.120\n Just keep going.\n\n2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:37.480\n That's the lesson of martial arts.\n\n2:19:37.480 --> 2:19:42.040\n I think, you know, we think it's like how to be strong or how to be how to win.\n\n2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:45.960\n But in reality, it's like how to persist, how to endure, because it's all of us have\n\n2:19:45.960 --> 2:19:49.800\n been beaten so many times and gotten beaten up so many times and thought about quitting.\n\n2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:51.000\n Have I ever thought about quitting?\n\n2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:51.720\n Absolutely.\n\n2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:52.600\n Have I ever quit?\n\n2:19:52.600 --> 2:19:52.920\n Never.\n\n2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:55.160\n I will never, ever quit ever.\n\n2:19:55.160 --> 2:19:56.200\n I can say that you might not me out.\n\n2:19:56.200 --> 2:19:57.880\n I won't be damned if I quit.\n\n2:19:57.880 --> 2:19:59.080\n What's the darkest moment?\n\n2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:00.280\n Is it injury related?\n\n2:20:00.280 --> 2:20:07.640\n Like, is it, uh, so like, to me, like two possibilities, I've fortunately never been\n\n2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:13.320\n seriously injured, but I think that's a dark place to be like having to be out for many\n\n2:20:13.320 --> 2:20:22.040\n months, uh, for, um, as Jen was saying, like with a head injury, especially like the uncertainty\n\n2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:22.840\n that's one.\n\n2:20:22.840 --> 2:20:29.880\n And then the other side is if you have big ambitions as a competitor, realizing that\n\n2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:36.360\n you're not as good, like those, those doubts were like, I kind of suck.\n\n2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:39.000\n How am I supposed to be a world?\n\n2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:40.520\n The greatest fighter of all time.\n\n2:20:41.080 --> 2:20:47.320\n If I, if, if like several people in the gym are kicking my ass, those are the two things\n\n2:20:47.320 --> 2:20:48.680\n that paralyze you.\n\n2:20:48.680 --> 2:20:55.400\n I think that everyone's darkest moment is maybe different looking from the outside for\n\n2:20:55.400 --> 2:20:55.720\n Ryan.\n\n2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:58.360\n I wouldn't say that he's had injuries and he's had bad ones.\n\n2:20:58.360 --> 2:21:00.120\n I wouldn't say that was his darkest moment.\n\n2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:05.240\n I think for me, I would say some of my head injury was my darkest moment.\n\n2:21:06.120 --> 2:21:06.600\n Absolutely.\n\n2:21:06.600 --> 2:21:08.440\n And I've torn my ACL twice.\n\n2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:09.800\n I've torn my shoulders four times.\n\n2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:11.000\n I've had lots of surgeries.\n\n2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:17.560\n For me, the orthopedic injuries were not the most difficult.\n\n2:21:17.560 --> 2:21:21.000\n It was the brain injury for others that might be the case for them.\n\n2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:25.720\n Maybe they've never experienced an injury and maybe for them, that's their darkest moment\n\n2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:30.040\n from the outside, obviously Ryan can speak to this more, but for Ryan, I think it was\n\n2:21:30.040 --> 2:21:37.080\n the inability to, to perform at certain points to the upper, the missing of opportunities\n\n2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:41.640\n that for him, from my perspective, watching him go through and having seen various points\n\n2:21:41.640 --> 2:21:46.680\n of his growth from, from early purple belt on, I think the hardest time for him looking\n\n2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:53.400\n in obviously was when he would hit moments where he wasn't able to perform for various\n\n2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:53.720\n reasons.\n\n2:21:53.720 --> 2:21:54.600\n He couldn't get fights.\n\n2:21:54.600 --> 2:21:57.000\n He, he was having difficulties there.\n\n2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.960\n I think that that was the hardest point for him.\n\n2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:04.120\n Did you, did you think like with the head injury that you might not, never be able to\n\n2:22:04.120 --> 2:22:05.240\n jujitsu again?\n\n2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:05.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:05.480 --> 2:22:11.720\n I mean, I, I, mine was very, was really bad and it was just the one hit, but I had a looping\n\n2:22:11.720 --> 2:22:13.000\n memories for seven months.\n\n2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:16.200\n Didn't know it because when your brain's messed up, you're not even aware that you're\n\n2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:16.600\n looping.\n\n2:22:17.880 --> 2:22:21.640\n And so I saw two different neurologists.\n\n2:22:21.640 --> 2:22:23.400\n I finally, like it took a very long time.\n\n2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:27.640\n I didn't know if I was going to be able to have like linear thoughts or read a book.\n\n2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:31.720\n I didn't know at certain points if I could listen to music again, you know, without it\n\n2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:32.760\n making my head hurt.\n\n2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:38.280\n And so it was almost two years before I woke up in the morning without a headache.\n\n2:22:39.880 --> 2:22:41.960\n Just waking up before I even start my day.\n\n2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:44.200\n And so that's even bigger than jujitsu.\n\n2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:45.000\n That's just life.\n\n2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:46.840\n That's just, that's just hard.\n\n2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:50.120\n And I think that you can experience so many things.\n\n2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:53.640\n I've had all these injuries.\n\n2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:56.920\n We lost a baby when I was 15, 15 weeks.\n\n2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:02.840\n And we've had all these experiences and what the hardest point for me, not saying all those\n\n2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:05.800\n things weren't hard, but it's kind of like, well, did you go through these?\n\n2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:09.480\n You just realize like life goes on and you have to keep working at it and you have to\n\n2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:09.960\n keep going.\n\n2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:16.440\n And you asked me earlier offline, did I feel depressed and not for my head injury.\n\n2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:20.840\n I don't think that at least in the moment I had a, any recognition of that.\n\n2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:24.040\n It's kind of like, but I think different people's personalities.\n\n2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:27.960\n I have kind of the like buckle down and just keep going.\n\n2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:32.760\n And sometimes it's not until lots of time later that you realize, wow, that was really\n\n2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:37.160\n hard because you're just struggling to live and function and do the things that you need\n\n2:23:37.160 --> 2:23:37.720\n to do along the way.\n\n2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:42.440\n Do you mind jumping on just like this part of the conversation just for a few minutes?\n\n2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:45.480\n Do you mind, you know, just sitting together?\n\n2:23:45.480 --> 2:23:46.920\n Oh, not at all.\n\n2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:53.560\n Just for a little bit, it'd be cool if we put a face to it, you know, is it okay with\n\n2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:53.800\n you?\n\n2:23:53.800 --> 2:23:54.680\n Yeah, it's fine with me.\n\n2:23:54.680 --> 2:23:55.320\n It's fine with you.\n\n2:23:56.280 --> 2:23:58.040\n By the way, what was the head injury?\n\n2:23:58.040 --> 2:23:59.320\n If you don't mind sharing.\n\n2:23:59.320 --> 2:24:02.280\n Someone had dropped their knee on the back of my head during training.\n\n2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:04.200\n It was a lot bigger than me.\n\n2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:09.480\n So one strike to the back of the head is too much for someone.\n\n2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:11.320\n There's a reason that's outlawed in MMA, right?\n\n2:24:11.320 --> 2:24:14.120\n Someone 50 pounds heavier than you dropped their knee on the back of your head once.\n\n2:24:14.120 --> 2:24:16.760\n And it's the funny thing about getting hit, right?\n\n2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:19.400\n You never can really be sure what's going to happen.\n\n2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:22.520\n I think it's actually one of the magical parts about jiu jitsu where, like, if you choke\n\n2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:29.080\n me, if we know what's going to occur, you hit someone, they might be completely unharmed.\n\n2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:32.760\n You might be punching Tony Ferguson in the face and you need to hit him with a sledge\n\n2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:34.280\n hammer to affect this man.\n\n2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:37.960\n And then other people, they could get really badly hurt, which I guess it's back to your\n\n2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:42.600\n point about street fighting and things like that and serious, serious potential, second,\n\n2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:45.320\n third order consequences of any action that we take.\n\n2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:47.560\n But yeah, that's a tricky thing about getting hit.\n\n2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:54.440\n How does it make you feel that, like the really shitty thing about injuries to me was that\n\n2:24:54.440 --> 2:25:00.440\n like you start thinking like, well, if I did this one little thing different, like this\n\n2:25:00.440 --> 2:25:01.640\n wouldn't have happened today.\n\n2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:04.520\n Like one moment changes your entire life.\n\n2:25:05.160 --> 2:25:09.720\n Is that, do you think that way or is that totally counterproductive?\n\n2:25:09.720 --> 2:25:14.520\n You can't help but think that way when you've had the amount of injuries I've had, because\n\n2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.080\n I've had more than most people's fair share.\n\n2:25:18.200 --> 2:25:20.760\n As my orthopedic says, you don't want to win that.\n\n2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:23.160\n You don't want to win the contest of who's had the most.\n\n2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:25.240\n But since you have, you're building me a pool.\n\n2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:30.840\n Yeah, but I think you can't help but think that way sometimes, but I definitely don't\n\n2:25:30.840 --> 2:25:34.920\n think it's, I think it can be facilitated if you don't beat yourself up too much.\n\n2:25:34.920 --> 2:25:41.960\n Because thinking about why have I been subject to so many injuries and a lot of it comes\n\n2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:47.320\n to just almost all of mine in particular are people a lot heavier than me.\n\n2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:51.400\n But if I've been training martial arts 15 years, I'm obviously on the much smaller side.\n\n2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:52.120\n I'm a woman.\n\n2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:57.800\n I've done thousands and thousands of rounds with people 50 pounds plus heavier than me.\n\n2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:01.640\n I've been years not training with anyone less than 50 pounds, which is 50 pounds is almost\n\n2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:02.760\n half my body weight.\n\n2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:08.040\n And when you also add testosterone, the natural physiological advantages of men, not just\n\n2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:11.400\n are they heavier with more mass, they're faster, they're more explosive, they're stronger\n\n2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:13.640\n if they're the same size.\n\n2:26:13.640 --> 2:26:19.880\n And so I think that the willingness to be in that environment over and over and over\n\n2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:23.640\n again creates a lot of strength, resiliency, willingness to continue.\n\n2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:31.400\n But it also like in order to do that, you almost have to, for me, the way I was approaching\n\n2:26:31.400 --> 2:26:37.800\n it was like pretend like I wasn't more vulnerable and just be willing to step in and step in\n\n2:26:37.800 --> 2:26:40.760\n and step in until you make it kind of thing until you make it kind of.\n\n2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:43.560\n Yeah, like I'll just one day I'll be strong enough.\n\n2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:48.600\n And you avoided injury for most, for most of those rounds, I would enjoy the problem\n\n2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:52.520\n as Ryan points out is that like you could do thousands of rounds, but if one person\n\n2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:57.320\n that size, that strength, that hover reacts in a way that you don't expect, it doesn't\n\n2:26:57.320 --> 2:26:59.560\n it's not like an oops, it's like always major.\n\n2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.960\n Do you regret any of it?\n\n2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:07.720\n I think that most no one I know has experienced the degree of injuries that I've experienced.\n\n2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:13.480\n And I started just at a time when 2005 is very different than now where you have the\n\n2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:15.800\n coaches have more control over what you're doing.\n\n2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:19.160\n They're more aware in general about a lot of the injuries.\n\n2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:25.560\n There's a lot more people who are hobbyists than when I started.\n\n2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:29.640\n They were hobbyists, but it was different kind of hobbyists, you know, than now.\n\n2:27:29.640 --> 2:27:32.680\n Now, our girls can train with other girls.\n\n2:27:32.680 --> 2:27:36.920\n They don't have to do thousands of rounds with somebody significantly more powerful\n\n2:27:36.920 --> 2:27:37.960\n than them.\n\n2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:43.800\n And for the drawbacks and the benefits of that, you know, as with anything.\n\n2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:49.960\n So I think I think that I don't think I would go back and change it.\n\n2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:54.440\n There were times after one of my injuries where I said to Ryan, I said, I quit, I'm\n\n2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:55.720\n done.\n\n2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:56.760\n I'm not doing this anymore.\n\n2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:01.960\n I probably said it more than once, but there was one time I was really serious in 2012.\n\n2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:03.080\n I was really serious.\n\n2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:04.120\n I tore my shoulder.\n\n2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.520\n I had I was looking at missing a big competition again in the world for my second or third\n\n2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:09.800\n year in a row after injuries.\n\n2:28:09.800 --> 2:28:12.360\n And I said, I'd quit my job two years before.\n\n2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:14.920\n And I'm like, I'm done.\n\n2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:19.080\n And Ryan, before that had always been, you know, keep me focused.\n\n2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.560\n And then he kind of said, OK, if you want to be done, be done.\n\n2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:23.800\n Just just have a good time.\n\n2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:25.000\n No, I'm really done.\n\n2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000\n I don't want to train anymore.\n\n2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.040\n OK, OK.\n\n2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:34.920\n And then, you know, I think he helped facilitate a moment for me to go visit a friend, some\n\n2:28:34.920 --> 2:28:38.680\n friends, some girls that were doing a girls camp who are close to my size or some friends\n\n2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:39.720\n of mine to go train.\n\n2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:42.120\n And I was like, oh, wait, I do love this thing.\n\n2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:46.200\n It's harder for me on a daily basis, but that doesn't mean I don't love this thing.\n\n2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:47.720\n And it really helped change my mind.\n\n2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:52.440\n I started to connect with other people, travel more myself because previously he had done\n\n2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:54.760\n that, but I hadn't really done that.\n\n2:28:54.760 --> 2:28:58.840\n I think there was a point where when I started YouTube, it was just for fun.\n\n2:28:58.840 --> 2:29:00.440\n I just wanted to sport after college.\n\n2:29:00.440 --> 2:29:01.560\n I played sports as a kid.\n\n2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.160\n I want to just want to exercise.\n\n2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:04.440\n I wasn't into the martial arts.\n\n2:29:04.440 --> 2:29:07.480\n He used to give me a hard time about it because he was always very, how can you not care about\n\n2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:08.040\n martial arts?\n\n2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:08.840\n I don't know.\n\n2:29:08.840 --> 2:29:09.880\n I just want to play sports.\n\n2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:15.080\n And Ryan was really big into kind of the philosophy side of the martial arts aspect.\n\n2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:17.000\n He used to give me a hard time.\n\n2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:20.280\n And I think after that moment, this moment where I looked at myself and I said, do I\n\n2:29:20.280 --> 2:29:23.320\n want to keep doing this, is when I started to appreciate jiu jitsu.\n\n2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:28.120\n It took off some of the pressure I'd been feeling, I think, as Ryan's girlfriend.\n\n2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:29.960\n But I had a full time job a long time.\n\n2:29:29.960 --> 2:29:33.320\n It was never my goal to be a jiu jitsu world champion.\n\n2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:37.480\n And I think after that moment where I was like, you know, I really do like this.\n\n2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:38.520\n I really do want to do this.\n\n2:29:38.520 --> 2:29:41.320\n I had this moment like any time where you're like, I'm doing this for me.\n\n2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:42.760\n I'm not doing this for him.\n\n2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:50.200\n And I think that that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives,\n\n2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:54.520\n do we have a kind of a challenge where we have to stop and we have to say, is this really\n\n2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:55.480\n what I want?\n\n2:29:55.480 --> 2:29:57.160\n How often in a relationship do you do that?\n\n2:29:57.160 --> 2:30:02.120\n How often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop and do you really ask yourself,\n\n2:30:02.120 --> 2:30:06.520\n is something really difficult happened that you look and you go, am I just doing this\n\n2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:08.040\n because it's convenient and easy?\n\n2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:09.800\n Or is this what I really want to do?\n\n2:30:09.800 --> 2:30:11.480\n Yeah, I've had those moments.\n\n2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:13.720\n Like this podcast is one of those things.\n\n2:30:13.720 --> 2:30:20.120\n It's like you stop and think like, I actually love this.\n\n2:30:20.120 --> 2:30:23.640\n And it's, I had that with jiu jitsu too.\n\n2:30:23.640 --> 2:30:28.440\n I don't think I had said until like brown belt that I stop.\n\n2:30:28.440 --> 2:30:33.400\n I mean, yeah, it's when you first face real challenges, you think like, why am I doing\n\n2:30:33.400 --> 2:30:33.640\n this?\n\n2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:38.520\n I think most of my progression was why not?\n\n2:30:38.520 --> 2:30:40.600\n I think that's the right, the leap of faith.\n\n2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:45.080\n And then at a certain point you think like, why am I doing this?\n\n2:30:45.080 --> 2:30:50.920\n And if you can answer, honestly, that because I love it, it's kind of a liberating feeling.\n\n2:30:50.920 --> 2:30:53.720\n It's a, yeah, it's so powerful.\n\n2:30:53.720 --> 2:30:54.760\n It's an acceptance.\n\n2:30:54.760 --> 2:30:56.840\n Then you feel thankful for the opportunity to be there, right?\n\n2:30:57.480 --> 2:30:58.120\n Because you love it.\n\n2:30:58.120 --> 2:31:00.520\n And you go, man, this is great gratitude.\n\n2:31:00.520 --> 2:31:02.760\n Yeah, it's ultimately gratitude.\n\n2:31:02.760 --> 2:31:03.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:03.400 --> 2:31:04.440\n Let me ask you this.\n\n2:31:04.440 --> 2:31:06.440\n So Ryan said like, what is it?\n\n2:31:06.440 --> 2:31:07.560\n I took over your thing.\n\n2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:10.680\n Yeah, nobody cares about Ryan.\n\n2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:11.800\n I wouldn't do that.\n\n2:31:11.800 --> 2:31:13.240\n I'll Photoshop him out or whatever.\n\n2:31:13.240 --> 2:31:14.840\n However you do that, it'd be great.\n\n2:31:14.840 --> 2:31:16.360\n Put Sean Connery's head.\n\n2:31:16.360 --> 2:31:16.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:17.560 --> 2:31:19.560\n Just like a Dune ad over there.\n\n2:31:19.560 --> 2:31:20.040\n Exactly.\n\n2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:23.480\n Sean Connery, I could get down on that.\n\n2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:26.200\n Is that the sexiest man in Sean Connery?\n\n2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:27.160\n In the Dune universe?\n\n2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:28.040\n That's my understanding.\n\n2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:28.760\n Okay.\n\n2:31:28.760 --> 2:31:29.960\n I think in any universe.\n\n2:31:30.520 --> 2:31:31.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:32.360\n Well, Myron Gosling, give him.\n\n2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:34.760\n We actually named our son after Sean Connery.\n\n2:31:34.760 --> 2:31:35.080\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:31:35.080 --> 2:31:35.480\n That's right.\n\n2:31:35.480 --> 2:31:39.240\n We did.\n\n2:31:39.240 --> 2:31:40.120\n He was in The Rock.\n\n2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:42.760\n That was, I love all those lame.\n\n2:31:42.760 --> 2:31:43.720\n Nicolas Cage.\n\n2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:44.360\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:46.760\n Connery is probably the greatest movie of all time.\n\n2:31:46.760 --> 2:31:49.160\n Dude, his accent in Connery was so awesome.\n\n2:31:49.160 --> 2:31:50.120\n I don't know where it's from.\n\n2:31:50.120 --> 2:31:51.560\n Alabama, I guess, or something.\n\n2:31:51.560 --> 2:31:53.320\n I love that they got like Steve Buscemi in there.\n\n2:31:53.320 --> 2:31:54.840\n Like we need Steve Buscemi in this thing.\n\n2:31:54.840 --> 2:31:55.480\n We got him.\n\n2:31:55.480 --> 2:31:56.760\n Dave Chappelle.\n\n2:31:56.760 --> 2:31:57.560\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:31:57.560 --> 2:31:57.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:57.800 --> 2:31:58.840\n He's a prisoner in there.\n\n2:31:58.840 --> 2:31:59.240\n Eight ball.\n\n2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:01.080\n Yep.\n\n2:32:01.080 --> 2:32:02.600\n Greatest movie of all time.\n\n2:32:02.600 --> 2:32:03.240\n Should have won an Oscar.\n\n2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:05.400\n Dave Chappelle also in Blue Street with Martin Lawrence.\n\n2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:08.040\n And then, what do you call it?\n\n2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:09.000\n Robin Hood Men in Tights.\n\n2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:11.320\n Oh, Robin Hood Men in Tights was one of my favorites as a kid.\n\n2:32:11.320 --> 2:32:11.880\n Half baked.\n\n2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:14.280\n But yeah, that's a good.\n\n2:32:16.440 --> 2:32:16.840\n Wow.\n\n2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:19.720\n We just listed off some really bad 90s movies, but.\n\n2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:20.760\n You take that back.\n\n2:32:20.760 --> 2:32:21.720\n For telling our age.\n\n2:32:23.160 --> 2:32:23.800\n Speak yourself.\n\n2:32:24.760 --> 2:32:30.440\n So what, like in your view, I don't mean to, from like a smaller person, I guess.\n\n2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:34.600\n That's an interesting thing about Jiu Jitsu is like that small.\n\n2:32:34.600 --> 2:32:37.800\n I don't, I hope, hopefully it's not a bad thing.\n\n2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:38.760\n Elf.\n\n2:32:40.120 --> 2:32:40.840\n Elves are taller.\n\n2:32:41.640 --> 2:32:47.880\n Like with all these like bigger people, you could still enjoy the art.\n\n2:32:47.880 --> 2:32:53.160\n Like what does it take to get a black belt to excel, to quote unquote, master the art?\n\n2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:55.800\n Gosh, everyone has such a different path.\n\n2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:59.000\n Ryan's promoted six, seven people.\n\n2:32:59.000 --> 2:32:59.560\n Something like that.\n\n2:32:59.560 --> 2:33:07.240\n And I think about half of them have had kids, have families, have other careers.\n\n2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:10.280\n At the time, some of them competed a lot.\n\n2:33:10.280 --> 2:33:13.240\n Some of them have never competed or rarely competed.\n\n2:33:13.240 --> 2:33:14.680\n Some haven't competed in a long time.\n\n2:33:15.560 --> 2:33:17.560\n Some had started different places.\n\n2:33:17.560 --> 2:33:21.640\n Everyone's had different journeys, even in our own little group of seven.\n\n2:33:22.520 --> 2:33:28.600\n I think only maybe only two or three were high level competitors of that group.\n\n2:33:28.600 --> 2:33:31.880\n At the higher belts, right, like brown, black, maybe.\n\n2:33:32.760 --> 2:33:35.640\n And so it's just different for every person.\n\n2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:37.720\n And that's something that we try to tell our students.\n\n2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:39.000\n We have 400 students.\n\n2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:41.800\n And do we have this?\n\n2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:47.720\n We don't really have anyone who's a stated other than like the coaches like Adam,\n\n2:33:47.720 --> 2:33:51.560\n but we don't have anyone who's like a stated high level competitor as a student at the moment.\n\n2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:53.480\n People look at our gym and go, it's lots of competitors.\n\n2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:54.520\n It's not lots of competitors.\n\n2:33:54.520 --> 2:33:57.160\n It's never been lots of competitors.\n\n2:33:57.160 --> 2:33:59.240\n And we've had ones and twos here and there.\n\n2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:03.800\n But really everybody's in it for the long term if they're in it.\n\n2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:07.000\n Sometimes the high level competitors are the ones that are more likely to drop off\n\n2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.760\n because they have a bit of success, particularly at blue or purple.\n\n2:34:10.760 --> 2:34:13.000\n And then they realize how hard it is at brown and black.\n\n2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.440\n And then they have a hard time continuing on that path.\n\n2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:18.680\n And then they can't look at themselves as a noncompetitor.\n\n2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:20.840\n They have a hard time continuing with Jiu Jitsu, I think.\n\n2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:26.120\n Whereas sometimes it's the guy who comes in as a white belt and he trains twice a week,\n\n2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:27.320\n twice a week, every week.\n\n2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:29.800\n And the next thing you know, he's been there for two or three years.\n\n2:34:29.800 --> 2:34:30.760\n Like, oh, he's a blue belt.\n\n2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:31.400\n He's a purple belt.\n\n2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:32.440\n He's a brown belt.\n\n2:34:32.440 --> 2:34:37.960\n And he's just consistent over a long period of time and willing to take the path.\n\n2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:40.360\n And no two people's path is exactly the same.\n\n2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.360\n No two people's lives are exactly the same.\n\n2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:50.280\n We have students who started as a white belt as a young adult with no responsibilities.\n\n2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:51.320\n And they train all the time.\n\n2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:53.400\n And then they have a job.\n\n2:34:53.400 --> 2:34:54.440\n Then they graduate college.\n\n2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:55.080\n Then they have a job.\n\n2:34:55.080 --> 2:34:55.800\n Then they have married.\n\n2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:56.440\n Then they have kids.\n\n2:34:56.440 --> 2:34:59.560\n Then they have different points in their careers and at different points in your life.\n\n2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:05.080\n Jiu Jitsu will be there for whatever way that you're willing to accept it.\n\n2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:06.440\n It's place, I think.\n\n2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:10.920\n Well, that's actually kind of back to the initial question we discussed about what makes\n\n2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:16.840\n a warrior and also what makes something or someone particularly impressive in my mind\n\n2:35:16.840 --> 2:35:19.480\n is like what they make out of what they have.\n\n2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:22.920\n One of my favorite movies ever is Forrest Gump.\n\n2:35:22.920 --> 2:35:27.320\n And it's obviously it's just if you can't because I've heard people go, Forrest Gump\n\n2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:27.560\n sucks.\n\n2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:29.000\n I'm like, I don't like you as a person.\n\n2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.200\n And you have no heart at all.\n\n2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:35.400\n But basically, it's the story of someone that tries hard.\n\n2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:37.720\n And it's like, yeah, but it's a funny movie.\n\n2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:43.720\n But it's like, you know, I guess you meet each person where they are, you know, and\n\n2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:45.960\n obviously you want everyone needs to be pushed.\n\n2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:46.920\n We all need to be pushed.\n\n2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:50.760\n We need friends and people around us that push us to be better versions of ourselves\n\n2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:52.040\n all the time.\n\n2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:55.880\n And as you mentioned, the people you spend all of your time around deeply impact you.\n\n2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.600\n And we have to be willing to be pushed.\n\n2:35:58.600 --> 2:36:04.680\n It takes a leap of faith for me to trust, for me to put some of myself in my, you know,\n\n2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:08.840\n I guess my ability, my control, my personal agency, as it were, in the hands of someone\n\n2:36:08.840 --> 2:36:12.200\n else that I trust and that I respect.\n\n2:36:12.200 --> 2:36:18.760\n But if I can do that, again, maybe I never become, you know, high level black belt competitor.\n\n2:36:18.760 --> 2:36:21.160\n But, you know, I had four of the things I was doing in my life.\n\n2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:22.040\n I also have a family.\n\n2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:25.240\n I have this, I have that, you know, what that person was able to accomplish in the martial\n\n2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:28.760\n arts relative to what they were able to put in this phenomenal, you know, other times\n\n2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:32.600\n someone could be a very successful black belt and in my mind be a bum because they could\n\n2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:33.560\n have been a lot more.\n\n2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:35.480\n And, you know, they could have done more.\n\n2:36:35.480 --> 2:36:37.000\n They could have focused more.\n\n2:36:37.000 --> 2:36:40.280\n And there's no shame in deciding that you don't want to do that.\n\n2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:45.960\n But whatever it is that you're invested in, I remember the Take It Uneasy podcast and\n\n2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:50.200\n that I loved because, you know, I'll just chill out like resting.\n\n2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:50.920\n It's like vacation.\n\n2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:51.800\n Oh, who wants to go on vacation?\n\n2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:53.160\n Yeah, I'll go on vacation for a day or two.\n\n2:36:53.160 --> 2:36:54.440\n You want to spend three weeks on vacation?\n\n2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:55.080\n Like, I kill myself.\n\n2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:55.800\n Like, get me out of here.\n\n2:36:55.800 --> 2:36:56.840\n Like, this is horrible.\n\n2:36:56.840 --> 2:36:58.280\n This is I'm a waste of life.\n\n2:36:58.280 --> 2:36:59.400\n I'm not doing anything useful.\n\n2:36:59.400 --> 2:37:01.480\n You're technically on vacation right now.\n\n2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:01.720\n Right.\n\n2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:02.600\n Well, this is fun, though.\n\n2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:04.120\n It's like a one day vacation.\n\n2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:04.520\n Exactly.\n\n2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:08.840\n But, you know, I'm sure you're thinking about jumping off of the building right now.\n\n2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:13.000\n But if you had to talk to me for, you know, like three days, I'm sure you'd probably\n\n2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:13.640\n shove me off the building.\n\n2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:14.200\n I don't blame you.\n\n2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:14.680\n I'll be dead.\n\n2:37:14.680 --> 2:37:16.760\n Five hours in.\n\n2:37:16.760 --> 2:37:20.840\n But, yeah, but, you know, it's like you want to be pushing towards something because otherwise\n\n2:37:20.840 --> 2:37:22.440\n what's the purpose of being here?\n\n2:37:22.440 --> 2:37:24.280\n You know, it's not just a college.\n\n2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:28.760\n It's doing something useful, building, growing as a person, helping others do the same if\n\n2:37:28.760 --> 2:37:31.160\n that's within your power at any given time.\n\n2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:34.200\n But I think that's kind of the neat thing about martial arts is it can be many, many\n\n2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:36.040\n different things to many different people.\n\n2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:40.120\n You know, I finally, for instance, was able to get a college degree this year.\n\n2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:43.240\n That which I mean, it's not a big deal for most people, but for me it was a big deal\n\n2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:45.000\n because I was going back and finish.\n\n2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:45.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:37:45.480 --> 2:37:47.400\n And I never envisioned ever going back.\n\n2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:50.440\n And that's a hard step to go back and finish.\n\n2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:53.720\n That's always heavy on you if you don't.\n\n2:37:53.720 --> 2:37:54.600\n It's interesting.\n\n2:37:54.600 --> 2:37:57.880\n I was just I was more proud of that than most things I've ever done, if I'm honest.\n\n2:37:57.880 --> 2:38:01.080\n You know, and it was neat and I really enjoyed it and it was the process of doing it.\n\n2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:04.840\n But, you know, are my academic credentials impressive?\n\n2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:06.200\n Like, not in the least.\n\n2:38:06.200 --> 2:38:10.920\n But for me, it's like it was a big deal for me personally to take that step and to go\n\n2:38:10.920 --> 2:38:11.720\n back and do that.\n\n2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:15.880\n And I was I was proud of the the direction and because it would have been easy, like,\n\n2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:16.520\n do I need to do it?\n\n2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:17.800\n Like, no, I'm in our business.\n\n2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:18.360\n I'll do OK.\n\n2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:18.760\n I'll try.\n\n2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:19.880\n I'll keep fighting.\n\n2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:24.840\n But I was happy to take the time in between fights when I was when I was unbooked for\n\n2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:28.200\n an opponent to do something productive rather than just I'll just hang out.\n\n2:38:28.200 --> 2:38:31.240\n You know, like I can still train every single day, but I can also train and go to school.\n\n2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:33.000\n People go to the Olympics while going to school.\n\n2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.720\n I can I can do martial arts and go to school.\n\n2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:44.680\n One thing I got to ask is, you know, a bunch of women listen to this podcast if they haven't\n\n2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:52.280\n done Jiu Jitsu, I think it'd be kind of intimidating to step on the mat with a bunch of bros that\n\n2:38:52.280 --> 2:38:54.600\n like enjoy somehow killing each other.\n\n2:38:55.320 --> 2:39:00.600\n Like, how do you succeed in that environment to where you can learn this art, learn how\n\n2:39:00.600 --> 2:39:02.120\n to beat all those people up?\n\n2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:04.840\n Oh, gosh.\n\n2:39:04.840 --> 2:39:05.720\n Is there any advice?\n\n2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:11.400\n I mean, another way to ask that is like if any women listening to this are interested\n\n2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:14.520\n in starting Jiu Jitsu, like, is there advice for that journey?\n\n2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.800\n Honestly, I think it's just walking in the door and starting.\n\n2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:21.960\n Sometimes I don't know how to respond to that because I'm not I don't view myself as typically\n\n2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:27.080\n anxious, particularly in interactions with other people or new people.\n\n2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:35.880\n Shy is not a word that has been used for me by if you ask my family and they joke because\n\n2:39:35.880 --> 2:39:37.080\n our son talks a lot.\n\n2:39:37.080 --> 2:39:40.440\n He's advanced verbally and they're always like, oh, well, let's we know where he gets\n\n2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.600\n that from because he just doesn't stop talking.\n\n2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:44.120\n He narrates everything he does.\n\n2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:50.840\n And so they always tease because that's like I'm known for for kind of talking a lot.\n\n2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:56.040\n But so I haven't been typically I'm not I don't consider myself a shy person.\n\n2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:02.280\n So for me, going into a new room, a new group of people is, you know, there's always that\n\n2:40:02.280 --> 2:40:04.760\n you don't really know who they are, how they're going to treat you.\n\n2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:08.280\n But I typically but I don't have a lot of anxiety with that.\n\n2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:11.160\n So I don't if that's something that's going to put something up.\n\n2:40:11.160 --> 2:40:15.080\n I don't really know how to to address that particular feeling.\n\n2:40:15.800 --> 2:40:21.240\n But in terms of all of the rooms I've been and I have popped into gyms before I knew\n\n2:40:21.240 --> 2:40:26.360\n Ryan in Florida, like I traveled for my job in Germany and Florida and in California and\n\n2:40:26.360 --> 2:40:28.760\n places where where I don't know anyone, they don't know me.\n\n2:40:29.400 --> 2:40:36.760\n And I have never once had anyone be anything other than than kind and solicitous and helpful\n\n2:40:36.760 --> 2:40:41.480\n and long before when I was a white belt and a blue belt and didn't know anything and\n\n2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:42.440\n I didn't know anyone.\n\n2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:49.160\n And I just think that it's a community of people that it's so cool that no matter where\n\n2:40:49.160 --> 2:40:54.920\n you go in the world, I walked into a gym in Prague one time where only two people spoke\n\n2:40:54.920 --> 2:41:01.160\n English and and it was just yes, weird, you know, it's weird that like part of a group\n\n2:41:01.160 --> 2:41:03.480\n and they're like, Oh, let me tell you what it's like to be part of a cult, right?\n\n2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.480\n Yeah, but it's like a positive cult, like it for sure.\n\n2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:09.000\n That's what we would say as cultists.\n\n2:41:09.720 --> 2:41:11.080\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:13.080\n That's true.\n\n2:41:13.080 --> 2:41:15.880\n I mean, we do need to murder everybody who practice Aikido.\n\n2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.360\n Yeah, that's this cult deeply believes it.\n\n2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:24.520\n No, but there is a like if you look at different kinds of games like chess and so on, like\n\n2:41:25.080 --> 2:41:26.360\n there's a skepticism.\n\n2:41:27.160 --> 2:41:30.440\n I mean, there's not a brotherhood, sisterhood feeling with Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:41:30.440 --> 2:41:32.440\n It's like you can roll into most places.\n\n2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:37.240\n Even like with Judo, like I can see the contrast like because I've trained in Judo places.\n\n2:41:38.520 --> 2:41:46.040\n It it's more like tribal, like you walk in and like, who is this?\n\n2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:49.000\n Like there's that kind of feeling with Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:52.360\n There's less so there is a little bit with like the competitors.\n\n2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:56.360\n There's always like the competitors feeling each other out usually like the blue belts.\n\n2:41:56.360 --> 2:42:01.640\n But like outside of that, in terms of if you don't get the if you walk in with the vibes of just\n\n2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:07.720\n loving the art and just wanting to have a good time, you're like welcome.\n\n2:42:07.720 --> 2:42:08.760\n It's really cool.\n\n2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:10.120\n It's really fascinating.\n\n2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:12.040\n It's a really great thing.\n\n2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:16.520\n I think in as a woman, I think you you think you're walking into these rooms of these,\n\n2:42:16.520 --> 2:42:18.440\n you know, big, strong, tough guys.\n\n2:42:18.440 --> 2:42:23.960\n And if anything, I would I would say that they're almost like much more solicitous when\n\n2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:27.400\n a woman comes in there and not like they're just like hitting on you all the time.\n\n2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:31.080\n You know, it's just that you walk in and everyone is like, oh, cool.\n\n2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:33.480\n You want to do this thing that I love.\n\n2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:36.360\n Let me make sure you have a good experience and take care of you.\n\n2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:40.920\n And I think that's that's an experience that that I hope people have when they come into our gym.\n\n2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:43.720\n And and I've always felt when I walked into other gyms.\n\n2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:47.240\n And so, you know, we try our best to to make that comfortable.\n\n2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:51.720\n And it can be a little uncomfortable because there are when you walk into a male dominated\n\n2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:55.320\n environment, there's conversations and topics.\n\n2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:59.240\n There's a different style of camaraderie and joking that a lot of men will do that.\n\n2:43:00.120 --> 2:43:02.040\n Maybe some women are more uncomfortable with.\n\n2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:07.000\n I grew up with four brothers, so I kind of maybe was a little more desensitized to that.\n\n2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:10.360\n And I worked for the Department of Defense for a while, too.\n\n2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:13.720\n So before I do with the government.\n\n2:43:13.720 --> 2:43:14.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:14.200 --> 2:43:15.560\n So so I did that.\n\n2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:16.520\n I'm already skeptical.\n\n2:43:16.520 --> 2:43:17.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:19.260\n I'm not.\n\n2:43:19.260 --> 2:43:19.760\n I'm not.\n\n2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:20.260\n I'm not.\n\n2:43:20.260 --> 2:43:20.760\n I'm not.\n\n2:43:20.760 --> 2:43:22.120\n Oh, you left.\n\n2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:25.320\n I'm not going to ask you about UFOs then, because you're not going to tell me the truth.\n\n2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:27.000\n No, they exist.\n\n2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:29.560\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.320\n No, you just freaked out a lot of people.\n\n2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:34.200\n OK, but yeah.\n\n2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:35.640\n By the way, where's where's your school?\n\n2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:37.080\n Because people always ask like where?\n\n2:43:38.440 --> 2:43:42.120\n Well, we're outside of Washington, D.C., in Northern Virginia, in Falls Church.\n\n2:43:42.120 --> 2:43:45.960\n You always want to pick like, what's the best school if I travel to this place or if I want\n\n2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:47.160\n to move to this place?\n\n2:43:47.160 --> 2:43:49.320\n So that's well, I mean, obviously we're biased.\n\n2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:51.800\n But yeah, we're in the Washington, D.C. area.\n\n2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:52.300\n The best.\n\n2:43:52.840 --> 2:43:54.360\n OK, we just took a little break.\n\n2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:55.400\n Now we're back.\n\n2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:59.320\n Let me ask you one thing that a bunch of people are curious about.\n\n2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:01.400\n You're one of the innovators.\n\n2:44:01.400 --> 2:44:06.280\n First of all, you're one of the great innovators and philosophers and thinkers in Jiu Jitsu,\n\n2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:06.780\n right?\n\n2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:13.240\n But you're also one of the innovators in terms of leg locks and the 50 50 position.\n\n2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:17.720\n And just like the fact that legs have something to do in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:44:17.720 --> 2:44:25.560\n The other popularizer innovator in the space is John Donoher and his whole group of guys.\n\n2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:32.200\n Do you have thoughts about their whole system of leg locks and their ideas about Jiu Jitsu\n\n2:44:32.200 --> 2:44:33.000\n and so on?\n\n2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:37.720\n Sure, I guess, you know, obviously, you know, John and the students at HENZO have been able\n\n2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:40.840\n to do fantastic things competitively in the past number of years.\n\n2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:46.920\n And, you know, you mentioned innovators in the in that kind of, you know, section of\n\n2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:47.720\n Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:53.400\n I would be I'd love to bring up some guys like Dean Lister, of course, Masakazu Imanari.\n\n2:44:53.400 --> 2:44:57.800\n In fact, a lot of what was going on in like nineties Japan, like combat submission wrestling,\n\n2:44:57.800 --> 2:45:02.680\n there was some crazy gnarly stuff that it's just it's on grainy VHS tape, but like stuff\n\n2:45:02.680 --> 2:45:05.080\n that if people were doing now, they go, oh, my God, that's brand new.\n\n2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:10.040\n Like there's it's it's been I think these are things that have been around for a while\n\n2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:11.080\n in various places.\n\n2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:17.000\n I first learned the 50 50 position, just like the leg entanglement of it from Brandon Vera,\n\n2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:20.440\n actually, at a seminar at Lord Irwin's Martial Arts thing in 2005.\n\n2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:25.320\n He learned it from Dean Lister, who used it to submit Alexandria Kakareko, really, really\n\n2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:30.520\n tough Nogi guy at ADCC on there in the run that Dean made to the to the gold medal in\n\n2:45:30.520 --> 2:45:33.080\n the absolute division, which was a great performance at the time.\n\n2:45:33.080 --> 2:45:34.280\n First American to do that.\n\n2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:38.120\n And, you know, and I actually saw a video.\n\n2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:40.040\n I mean, first, a boss rootin actually broke.\n\n2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:44.920\n I think Guy Mezger's foot with a 50 50 heel hook that he actually grabbed his heel and\n\n2:45:44.920 --> 2:45:49.320\n his and his toes went and in pancreases back when they had like the man panties in the\n\n2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:50.760\n high, high boots on.\n\n2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:51.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:52.200\n And that was gnarly.\n\n2:45:52.200 --> 2:45:53.560\n Boss rootin is underappreciated.\n\n2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:58.200\n It's like it's like he double grab like and oh, yeah, like, you know, his leverage is\n\n2:45:58.200 --> 2:45:58.520\n leverage.\n\n2:45:58.520 --> 2:46:01.560\n It's that's like a toehold that, you know, that goes the other way.\n\n2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:03.800\n And it's like it either doesn't work or breaks in half.\n\n2:46:03.800 --> 2:46:09.480\n And well, he's is people don't often think of boss rootin as an innovator, but he is\n\n2:46:09.480 --> 2:46:15.560\n in a way like he, you know, talk about like Elon Musk and first principles thinking in\n\n2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:16.360\n terms of physics.\n\n2:46:16.920 --> 2:46:19.480\n He like just feels like he just gets the job.\n\n2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:24.520\n He figures out like the simplest way to get the job done of breaking things and establishing\n\n2:46:24.520 --> 2:46:25.800\n control and hurting people.\n\n2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:27.080\n Remember that was back in the day boss.\n\n2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:31.560\n If you listen to boss rootin do any like commentary for any of the the big MMA shows or any MMA\n\n2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:34.520\n show way back when anytime guys were clinches like the guys roll for a knee bar.\n\n2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:38.280\n He was saying that way back when and now people are doing it all the time with varying degrees\n\n2:46:38.280 --> 2:46:38.840\n of success.\n\n2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:39.800\n It's it's funny.\n\n2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:43.080\n It's like it's also tough to be, I think, like a breakaway thinker.\n\n2:46:43.080 --> 2:46:46.040\n I mean, you know, group think is a real thing and group inertia.\n\n2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:52.440\n And it's it's neat to see, you know, particularly at a time when maybe that type of stuff was\n\n2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:53.240\n less accepted.\n\n2:46:54.520 --> 2:46:57.320\n You know, someone going, hey, I'm going to I'm going to run off in this other direction.\n\n2:46:57.320 --> 2:47:01.240\n I think, you know, whoever, you know, the inventor of electricity in my mind is a lot\n\n2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.480\n more impressive than whomever not to say that the person down the line isn't impressive\n\n2:47:05.480 --> 2:47:07.400\n that comes up with an interesting way to use it.\n\n2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:08.200\n Both are cool.\n\n2:47:08.200 --> 2:47:12.280\n But when you think about just can you imagine we're sitting here like, yeah, people, I'm\n\n2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:13.240\n going to build an airplane.\n\n2:47:13.240 --> 2:47:14.360\n You're like, what are you talking about?\n\n2:47:14.360 --> 2:47:14.840\n It's crazy.\n\n2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:15.640\n People don't fly.\n\n2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:16.680\n I'm like, no, I'm going to do it.\n\n2:47:16.680 --> 2:47:19.640\n And of course, it's not going to be as good as the airplane down the line, the iterative\n\n2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:21.320\n things that happen later on.\n\n2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:26.440\n But just being able to go to dream something into existence that you haven't seen before\n\n2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:31.000\n and then make it happen, like takes an unbelievable like strength of character, almost like a\n\n2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:37.000\n force of will, because you have you're you're blazing a trail that hasn't been washed away\n\n2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:37.720\n walked before.\n\n2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:41.960\n That's the BJ Penn factor in, you know, winning the Jiu Jitsu World Championship.\n\n2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:44.760\n First non Brazilian to do that was back in 2001.\n\n2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:46.520\n And then Rafael Lovato later on.\n\n2:47:46.520 --> 2:47:50.360\n It's like he's you know, both of those guys are so unbelievably impressive in my mind\n\n2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:55.240\n for the same reason, you know, because they were out there winning at a time when that\n\n2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:56.440\n wasn't a common thing.\n\n2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.800\n Not that it's easy to win now.\n\n2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:01.240\n It's just there's not a psychological hurdle that needs to be left.\n\n2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:04.200\n I remember, you know, when I was early in Jiu Jitsu, like Americans weren't winning\n\n2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:05.640\n the world championships at any belt.\n\n2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:08.280\n I mean, BJ, we all knew BJ Penn because BJ Penn did it.\n\n2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:10.360\n But it was really, really uncommon.\n\n2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:12.760\n Now it happens, you know, on a semi regular basis.\n\n2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:14.040\n Of course, the Brazilians are so strong.\n\n2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:15.080\n Europeans are still strong.\n\n2:48:15.640 --> 2:48:18.040\n But in Australians are coming on as well.\n\n2:48:18.040 --> 2:48:20.680\n But it's definitely kind of an interesting thing.\n\n2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:25.240\n So to come back to, you know, John Danaher and the Henzo team, obviously, they're doing\n\n2:48:25.240 --> 2:48:26.120\n fantastic things.\n\n2:48:26.120 --> 2:48:28.440\n John's had some really, really great innovation there.\n\n2:48:28.440 --> 2:48:33.800\n And the systematization and the methodology that they're using is great.\n\n2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:36.040\n And it's neat to see that it's getting out there.\n\n2:48:36.040 --> 2:48:41.160\n I would just also want, I would encourage people to make sure that they're catching\n\n2:48:41.160 --> 2:48:44.120\n up on their history because obviously, you know, John's a brilliant instructor and has\n\n2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:48.520\n done things for the sport that are fantastic that haven't been done before.\n\n2:48:48.520 --> 2:48:50.360\n But, you know, none of us exist in a vacuum.\n\n2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:51.800\n And I've learned things from everywhere else.\n\n2:48:51.800 --> 2:48:53.880\n So, you know, John would say the same, I'm sure.\n\n2:48:53.880 --> 2:48:56.040\n And, you know, Dean Lister would say the same.\n\n2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:59.960\n And it's just neat when you can kind of trace the history of all of this happening because\n\n2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:03.880\n we've had, humanity's had two arms and two legs for some time, at least as long as I've\n\n2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:04.360\n been alive.\n\n2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:06.280\n But you mentioned, like, airplanes.\n\n2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:09.560\n Do you think there's something totally new to be invented in Jiu Jitsu still?\n\n2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:16.360\n Not totally new, but like the, you know, flying isn't new, but airplanes nevertheless made\n\n2:49:16.360 --> 2:49:17.480\n that much more efficient.\n\n2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:22.280\n Is there, like, new ideas to be discovered in Jiu Jitsu still?\n\n2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:26.200\n I'd say, the reason I'd say yes is the same reason I would say I believe in alchemy, even\n\n2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:27.240\n though I don't.\n\n2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:27.800\n No, I'm serious.\n\n2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:29.720\n I've got some backing for this.\n\n2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:30.040\n Okay.\n\n2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:36.040\n You know, I guess I talk about this with a buddy of mine a lot, like, and facilitative\n\n2:49:36.040 --> 2:49:37.960\n versus not facilitative beliefs.\n\n2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:44.040\n And if I don't believe something is possible and I do no investigation towards it, I'll\n\n2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:45.720\n never find something even if it's there.\n\n2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:49.000\n It's almost like it's no different than me walking up on a group of people and going\n\n2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.680\n like, oh, man, look at these jerks.\n\n2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:53.800\n This is going to suck versus me going, oh, I wonder what these guys are up to.\n\n2:49:53.800 --> 2:49:57.400\n I'm about to have two very different conversations, even though the players in the game are no\n\n2:49:57.400 --> 2:49:57.720\n different.\n\n2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:02.680\n My internal constitution has changed because of how I've decided to approach the situation.\n\n2:50:02.680 --> 2:50:06.600\n So, although I wouldn't personally want to spend all my time trying to turn lead into\n\n2:50:06.600 --> 2:50:11.320\n gold because I don't believe that it's likely to work, only a person who's willing to spend\n\n2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:14.200\n his or her life in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that.\n\n2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:18.120\n And also, in the pursuit of that, they're likely to find other things.\n\n2:50:18.120 --> 2:50:21.960\n So, I think a lot of times the idea is that humanity is pushed forward by, you know, again,\n\n2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:23.400\n it's another Orson Scott Card one.\n\n2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:25.560\n It's like, you know, human beings are in this slog.\n\n2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:28.120\n It's paraphrasing, just in this slog over time.\n\n2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:32.520\n And then periodically, humanity gives birth to genius, like someone that invents the wheel,\n\n2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:36.920\n invents electricity, pushes us forward, you know, comes up with the idea of governance\n\n2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:40.600\n that doesn't, you know, just start and end with the point of a sword, you know.\n\n2:50:40.600 --> 2:50:43.320\n And, you know, these aren't common things.\n\n2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:47.320\n These are unbelievable advancements that, you know, just me sitting here, I didn't come\n\n2:50:47.320 --> 2:50:49.080\n up with them, but I just get the benefit of it.\n\n2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:52.840\n So, I guess what I would say is a lot of times these ideas are called crazy, you know, like\n\n2:50:52.840 --> 2:50:54.280\n as we discussed kind of offline.\n\n2:50:54.280 --> 2:50:58.600\n It's like, you know, Einstein was brilliant in his 20s and he was brilliant before that,\n\n2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:02.920\n I would suspect, but basically, you know, gets recognized later on in life.\n\n2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:05.080\n And of course, we all thought those were great ideas.\n\n2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:08.280\n The man was probably roundly mocked for giant chunks of his life.\n\n2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:13.080\n And I guess, so it's neat to, I would say there's definitely in my mind things that\n\n2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:17.800\n even if it's just combinations and new to me, new ways to see things, new ways to understand\n\n2:51:17.800 --> 2:51:22.280\n different depth of understanding, possibly new things, new positions, new ideas, because\n\n2:51:22.280 --> 2:51:27.960\n even if that's not true, the process of going through and acting as if it is and believing\n\n2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:33.320\n like that and focusing and trying to investigate will make any of us, will push us all forward.\n\n2:51:33.320 --> 2:51:37.640\n Whereas sitting there, you know, obsessing over the cult of our current knowledge, I\n\n2:51:37.640 --> 2:51:42.520\n think is the biggest, the biggest danger and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists\n\n2:51:42.520 --> 2:51:43.000\n anywhere.\n\n2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:45.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:48.920\n And it starts with believing the impossible, which is kind of interesting.\n\n2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:54.200\n One of the things that's really inspiring to me is to see people out there, which sadly\n\n2:51:54.200 --> 2:52:00.760\n are rare, who kind of have a combination of two things.\n\n2:52:00.760 --> 2:52:06.360\n One is they have a worldview that involves, that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy.\n\n2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:12.280\n And the second part is they're exceptionally focused and competent in bringing that,\n\n2:52:13.320 --> 2:52:16.040\n whatever the ideas in that worldview to reality.\n\n2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:18.360\n So there's certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas.\n\n2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:20.040\n You know, there's a lot of conspiracy theorists.\n\n2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:27.240\n They have way out there beliefs about things, but they're not doing much to like make the,\n\n2:52:27.240 --> 2:52:29.480\n like build stuff grounded.\n\n2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:31.400\n Like they're not engineers or whatever.\n\n2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:33.480\n They're just like espousing different crazy ideas.\n\n2:52:33.480 --> 2:52:36.440\n But that's why you get like the Elon Musk type characters.\n\n2:52:36.440 --> 2:52:40.280\n And the reason I bring him up a lot is because like, there's not many others to bring up.\n\n2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:44.440\n It's like, there's not many examples of it through history.\n\n2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:49.000\n The people, I mean, the guy's convinced that we're going to colonize Mars.\n\n2:52:49.640 --> 2:52:55.640\n And basically everybody on earth thinks that's insane.\n\n2:52:56.520 --> 2:52:58.280\n Everyone except the guy that's going to do it, right?\n\n2:52:58.280 --> 2:52:59.400\n Except that's going to do it.\n\n2:52:59.400 --> 2:53:04.520\n And like, you can imagine like a couple of hundred years from now, people will,\n\n2:53:05.800 --> 2:53:09.560\n I mean, first of all, they won't, certainly won't remember the haters.\n\n2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:12.040\n They won't remember all the people.\n\n2:53:12.040 --> 2:53:16.840\n If they do remember them, they'll remember them in a sense like people were silly to\n\n2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:20.440\n think that this isn't the obvious path forward.\n\n2:53:20.440 --> 2:53:24.760\n Like from a perspective, that's what Elon talks about.\n\n2:53:24.760 --> 2:53:28.040\n Like it's obvious that we're going to expand throughout the universe.\n\n2:53:28.760 --> 2:53:29.720\n Like, so.\n\n2:53:29.720 --> 2:53:30.440\n From his perspective.\n\n2:53:30.440 --> 2:53:31.640\n From his perspective.\n\n2:53:31.640 --> 2:53:39.080\n Like, but to me it is also obvious because like either we destroy ourselves or we'll\n\n2:53:39.080 --> 2:53:40.600\n expand beyond earth.\n\n2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:47.320\n Like, there's not many, well, maybe it's not completely obvious.\n\n2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:49.160\n I guess I share that worldview.\n\n2:53:49.160 --> 2:53:55.560\n There's the other possibility that we humans find a sort of an inner peace where the forces\n\n2:53:55.560 --> 2:54:00.200\n of capitalism will calm down and we'll all just meditate and do yoga and Jiu Jitsu and\n\n2:54:00.200 --> 2:54:03.960\n like relax with this whole tech thing where we keep building new technologies.\n\n2:54:03.960 --> 2:54:10.120\n But it's cool to have those kinds of people that just believe the big ambitious, crazy\n\n2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:12.280\n dreams because that's where it starts.\n\n2:54:12.280 --> 2:54:16.760\n If you want to build something, you have to first believe that when you also have to believe\n\n2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:20.680\n strongly enough that you're not vulnerable and I'm speculating, but it's like, I can\n\n2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:24.840\n only imagine how many people have told Elon that what he's doing is crazy.\n\n2:54:24.840 --> 2:54:28.760\n So not only did he dream it up, he dreamed it up, went with it and also went with it\n\n2:54:28.760 --> 2:54:32.200\n in the face of being told that it's not going to work.\n\n2:54:32.200 --> 2:54:35.960\n And then anytime, and then also stepped away from the bitterness because he's done a\n\n2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:37.880\n series of really crazy, impressive things.\n\n2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:41.320\n And that's only those little things that I'm aware of, but, and also staying away from\n\n2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:43.880\n the bitterness of every single time you did something good.\n\n2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:46.600\n Initially, all I do is talk down about you.\n\n2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:50.200\n And then eventually I act as, of course, of course, I never apologize.\n\n2:54:50.200 --> 2:54:55.080\n And yet you don't let that dampen your spirits for the next innovation, which is pretty incredible\n\n2:54:55.080 --> 2:54:55.720\n to me to watch.\n\n2:54:55.720 --> 2:54:57.240\n Yeah, it's kind of cool.\n\n2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:03.080\n I mean, it's contagious to spend time with the guy because he's not, it's, Rogan has\n\n2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:11.080\n the same look to him, which is interesting about these people is like, there's like a\n\n2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:15.880\n hater shield that he's like, he doesn't even like sense them.\n\n2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:22.120\n It feels like, like it doesn't, he thinks to Elon it's like, it's obvious.\n\n2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:27.560\n I mean, he keeps calling it like first principles thinking, like physics says it's true.\n\n2:55:27.560 --> 2:55:28.200\n Therefore it's true.\n\n2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:33.800\n Like he's convinced himself that like his beliefs are grounded in the fundamental fabric\n\n2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:35.560\n of the way the universe works.\n\n2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:37.000\n Therefore the haters don't matter.\n\n2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:37.240\n Right.\n\n2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:39.880\n And I mean, that's kind of like a system of thought.\n\n2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:43.160\n He developed himself through all the difficulties, through all the doubt.\n\n2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:48.200\n He's able to take huge risks with basically putting everything he owes on the line multiple\n\n2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:49.640\n times throughout his life.\n\n2:55:49.640 --> 2:55:55.240\n Amidst all the drama, amidst all the doubts, amidst all like the, he's still able to make\n\n2:55:55.240 --> 2:55:58.200\n just clear, clearheaded decisions.\n\n2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:01.000\n It's, I don't know what to make of it, but it's inspiring as hell.\n\n2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.600\n Well, it's, I think it's something that's funny.\n\n2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:07.160\n I think like, I can only imagine, you know, history will look back on him as a brilliant\n\n2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:11.320\n person, but that's not the only, there's, there's a lot of maybe not numeric, not statistically\n\n2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:14.600\n speaking, but a lot numerically on a giant planet of, you know, billions of people, a\n\n2:56:14.600 --> 2:56:15.560\n lot of brilliant people.\n\n2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:19.160\n Well, you know, time, place, luck, fortune, all that other stuff.\n\n2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:24.760\n But at the same time, that clearly isn't the only determining thing in making Elon Musk,\n\n2:56:24.760 --> 2:56:25.160\n Elon Musk.\n\n2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:29.720\n And obviously I don't know the guy from Adam and, but it's an interesting thing that it's\n\n2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:34.200\n not just his intellect, his belief system, his structure, how he's viewing the world.\n\n2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:37.400\n Like that's, did he, did he reason his way to that?\n\n2:56:37.400 --> 2:56:38.040\n Did he not?\n\n2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:39.240\n What other factors came in?\n\n2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:44.520\n I'm really curious about that because I guess coming, it's, again, I feel really strongly\n\n2:56:44.520 --> 2:56:50.360\n about people's belief structure and, and this, the, how they view the world being more important\n\n2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:52.360\n than the engine behind it.\n\n2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:54.760\n You know, it makes someone resilient or not.\n\n2:56:54.760 --> 2:56:57.720\n It makes someone positive or not because you could have 10,000.\n\n2:56:57.720 --> 2:57:01.160\n I think about this for competitive stuff, you could have 10,000 things going properly\n\n2:57:01.160 --> 2:57:02.360\n and one thing going improperly.\n\n2:57:02.360 --> 2:57:06.120\n If you focus on the improper, you'll probably fix it at a certain point, which is good,\n\n2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:08.200\n facilitated for development in the longterm.\n\n2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:12.520\n But if you had to go and try to perform a task in the next five minutes and you're\n\n2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:16.600\n focusing on the negative, your confidence and your, your, your belief in the positive\n\n2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:18.840\n outcome of the future is likely to be damaged.\n\n2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:22.680\n Whereas you could have 25 things going wrong, but you go, man, I sure am happy to be alive.\n\n2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:23.480\n How fortunate I am.\n\n2:57:23.480 --> 2:57:24.040\n This is great.\n\n2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:25.400\n I can't, this is, I have problems to solve.\n\n2:57:25.400 --> 2:57:26.040\n This is awesome.\n\n2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:29.560\n Versus I had to list the problems and I start bitching about them.\n\n2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:32.760\n Both of them are technically accurate, but it's, I guess, different lenses.\n\n2:57:32.760 --> 2:57:36.920\n And I think that's a really neat thing to see, you know, someone, you know, exemplifying\n\n2:57:36.920 --> 2:57:37.480\n that for us.\n\n2:57:39.480 --> 2:57:45.880\n So maybe to look at the, the fighting world, there's a million questions I can ask here.\n\n2:57:45.880 --> 2:57:51.080\n Like one, you mentioned BJ Penn, you, uh, first of all, you're undefeated in the UFC\n\n2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:56.840\n and one of the fights you've had is against BJ Penn, which is, uh, kind of an incredible\n\n2:57:56.840 --> 2:57:57.320\n fight.\n\n2:57:57.320 --> 2:57:58.840\n You, you won performance of the night.\n\n2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:06.520\n What did it feel like to, uh, to face BJ Penn and to beat him definitively as you did?\n\n2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:08.600\n Like, what's that whole experience like?\n\n2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:13.560\n I'll be honest, I didn't know if I was going to ever be able to fight again after beating\n\n2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.560\n Gray Maynard in 2016. Um, you know, I've had a couple of periods of those.\n\n2:58:17.560 --> 2:58:22.760\n I was about to join the army actually in, uh, when I was 30 before the, uh, for the\n\n2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:25.320\n UFC before Jen sent me over to ultimate fighter.\n\n2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:27.560\n I didn't want to go cause I was like, one, they're never going to pick me.\n\n2:58:27.560 --> 2:58:28.920\n Two, I'd be terrible for TV.\n\n2:58:28.920 --> 2:58:29.960\n Three, I'll probably say something.\n\n2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:32.600\n I'm going to get burned to death in the streets.\n\n2:58:32.600 --> 2:58:34.120\n You know, I'm like, this isn't a great idea.\n\n2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:37.880\n And then, uh, she said, we'll go out there, see what happens, do it anyway.\n\n2:58:37.880 --> 2:58:39.640\n And you'll be, you'll regret it if you didn't.\n\n2:58:39.640 --> 2:58:41.240\n And then I ended up doing ultimate fighter.\n\n2:58:41.240 --> 2:58:47.560\n And then, so I fought three times on the show and then I fought, um, for the, for the finale.\n\n2:58:47.560 --> 2:58:51.160\n So there's four times in like five or six months, which was great.\n\n2:58:51.160 --> 2:58:53.640\n And then it took me a year to get another opponent.\n\n2:58:53.640 --> 2:58:55.480\n Um, and that was Gray Maynard.\n\n2:58:55.480 --> 2:58:58.920\n And then Gray was obviously very tough guy, um, managed to get a good outcome there.\n\n2:58:58.920 --> 2:59:02.600\n Then it took two years to fight BJ Penn.\n\n2:59:02.600 --> 2:59:06.360\n And that was, you know, obviously I'm training all the time every single day and that never\n\n2:59:06.360 --> 2:59:09.160\n stops, but that was, I'll be honest, like pretty deeply frustrating.\n\n2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:12.440\n Cause you know, as a, as a human being, as an athlete, you know, I think as an athlete,\n\n2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:13.160\n you die twice.\n\n2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:17.160\n Like you have an athletic peak or area and then, then you go on with the rest of your\n\n2:59:17.160 --> 2:59:19.560\n life, but it is a microcosm for the rest of your life.\n\n2:59:19.560 --> 2:59:22.760\n It's like, you're, you're seeing this, the sand tick away in the hourglass would drop\n\n2:59:22.760 --> 2:59:27.800\n away and you're going, man, this is, these are the years between 31, 32, 33.\n\n2:59:27.800 --> 2:59:29.320\n Like I'll be at my best at this time.\n\n2:59:29.320 --> 2:59:33.320\n My absolute best physically now, not technically I'm a lot better now than I was before.\n\n2:59:33.320 --> 2:59:37.320\n And I plan, but at a certain point you will, unless you're Bernard Hopkins, you will reach\n\n2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:42.520\n diminishing returns and I guess the long, the long way you can feel the clock ticking\n\n2:59:42.520 --> 2:59:44.040\n is frustrating.\n\n2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:46.760\n Why, why did it take two years for BJ?\n\n2:59:46.760 --> 2:59:49.800\n I, I, I, that's the question people ask a lot.\n\n2:59:49.800 --> 2:59:52.280\n It's like, why does nobody want to fight Ryan?\n\n2:59:52.280 --> 2:59:52.680\n I don't know.\n\n2:59:52.680 --> 2:59:56.360\n I probably, they probably think they'll get infected by whatever this is, but I don't,\n\n2:59:56.360 --> 2:59:57.160\n I don't blame them.\n\n2:59:57.160 --> 3:00:00.760\n But I would mean you're a really tough opponent as bought as the bottom line.\n\n3:00:00.760 --> 3:00:01.960\n I'll say that I'm different.\n\n3:00:01.960 --> 3:00:06.200\n Maybe they perceive that the, the, the, the threat is greater than the reward.\n\n3:00:06.200 --> 3:00:11.080\n I'm hoping that now that we're ranked number 12, you know, in the UFC rankings that, that,\n\n3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:11.720\n that will change.\n\n3:00:11.720 --> 3:00:16.360\n And I know that if we're one more win and then we're in the top 10 that, you know, now,\n\n3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.720\n now we're, you're there.\n\n3:00:17.720 --> 3:00:21.960\n But what I've consistently found is that like randoms want to fight and I'm like, go away.\n\n3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:23.160\n I didn't come here for you.\n\n3:00:23.160 --> 3:00:26.120\n You know, cause if I wanted to just fight anybody, I could go down to a waffle house\n\n3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:28.680\n and yell until like DMX shows up and we can, we can fight.\n\n3:00:28.680 --> 3:00:29.720\n Cause he'll be at the waffle house too.\n\n3:00:29.720 --> 3:00:30.120\n Who am I kidding?\n\n3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:31.640\n I really want to hang out with the MX.\n\n3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:36.360\n But you know, it's like, you want to, when I had the opportunity, oh my God, that was\n\n3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:37.080\n so cool.\n\n3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:39.720\n I was, I would never, I would never fight DMX.\n\n3:00:39.720 --> 3:00:40.520\n We'd be on the same team.\n\n3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:48.600\n But anyway it's, I guess I accepted fights against, I asked, they got asked about Lamas.\n\n3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:49.240\n I said, yes.\n\n3:00:49.240 --> 3:00:50.760\n I got asked about Dennis Bermudez.\n\n3:00:50.760 --> 3:00:51.320\n I said, yes.\n\n3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:53.240\n You know, like long periods of time.\n\n3:00:53.240 --> 3:00:59.800\n And they, at that time, well, you know, in between 2016 and 2018 I was struggling to\n\n3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:01.880\n have, have opponents who would sign up.\n\n3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:04.360\n And so I haven't turned down fights.\n\n3:01:04.360 --> 3:01:07.960\n I've just said, Hey, you know, keep the, I don't care about fighting the randoms.\n\n3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:10.200\n And it's, you have a successful school.\n\n3:01:10.200 --> 3:01:15.480\n You're like, you're running your martial artists broadly speaking.\n\n3:01:15.480 --> 3:01:21.880\n So it doesn't make sense to take fights that aren't like that fit a certain kind of trajectory\n\n3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:22.520\n for your career.\n\n3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:25.480\n And that's when, when BJ Penn, they said, well, BJ is looking for an opponent.\n\n3:01:25.480 --> 3:01:27.000\n I was like, I'm, I'm your guy.\n\n3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:31.320\n And, and I think that, you know, BJ accepted that fight because I'm another jujitsu guy.\n\n3:01:31.320 --> 3:01:34.680\n I don't think he, he, he perceived that I was much of a threat on the feet.\n\n3:01:35.720 --> 3:01:42.200\n And, you know, I was able to, it was neat to get it to compete against someone, you\n\n3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:45.720\n know, who's one of my heroes, one of the people I looked up to in MMA for the longest time.\n\n3:01:45.720 --> 3:01:47.160\n Were you intimidated by that?\n\n3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:48.920\n No, no, I love competing.\n\n3:01:48.920 --> 3:01:51.720\n I don't really get nervous or scared before fights.\n\n3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:52.680\n I'm not afraid to get hurt.\n\n3:01:52.680 --> 3:01:53.640\n I'm not afraid to win.\n\n3:01:53.640 --> 3:01:54.920\n I'm not afraid to lose.\n\n3:01:54.920 --> 3:01:59.000\n It's, I, I'm just excited for the, I feel thankful for the opportunity to compete and\n\n3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.480\n the opportunity to, to play when it matters.\n\n3:02:01.480 --> 3:02:05.720\n You know, I, I just, that's the only time I'm interested in playing anymore is when\n\n3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:09.400\n it, when it matters, when the opposition is, I know that, you know, it's funny because\n\n3:02:09.400 --> 3:02:14.040\n people pick on, on a lot of some opponents, particularly after, after the fact, like if\n\n3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:17.000\n you, if you get a good outcome, well then, oh, of course, let's beat that guy.\n\n3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:17.800\n That guy wasn't that good.\n\n3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:19.800\n I'm like, well, I wasn't, that's after the fact.\n\n3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:20.840\n I get to say that.\n\n3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:25.720\n And also as the person in the ring, you know, BJ Penn has heard a lot of people in mixed\n\n3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:29.480\n martial arts cage and I could actually absolutely have been on that list.\n\n3:02:30.440 --> 3:02:34.360\n So it was neat to get to compete against someone that I really respect, someone that I looked\n\n3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:37.560\n up to for a long time, someone who has a great skillset.\n\n3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:39.960\n And also I went up in weight to fight him at his weight class.\n\n3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:42.360\n He didn't have to come down to mine, which is where he'd take it.\n\n3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:43.000\n It was lightweight.\n\n3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:43.640\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:43.640 --> 3:02:44.760\n I'm generally a featherweight.\n\n3:02:44.760 --> 3:02:46.840\n I walk around at like 158 pounds.\n\n3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:49.640\n So what's the lightweight and featherweight?\n\n3:02:49.640 --> 3:02:53.880\n Lightweight is 155 with the day before Wayne and featherweight is 145 with the day before\n\n3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:54.200\n Wayne.\n\n3:02:54.200 --> 3:02:56.840\n So I'm a little bit more properly sized for featherweight.\n\n3:02:57.400 --> 3:03:02.760\n But anyway, you know, I, so I didn't feel like obviously he was giving up a couple\n\n3:03:02.760 --> 3:03:06.360\n years of age, but I was giving up size and all this other stuff.\n\n3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:09.960\n And it was, you know, I was just excited to have the opportunity to step in against someone\n\n3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:14.840\n like BJ and you know, we managed to get out of there with a, with a good outcome without\n\n3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:16.440\n getting too banged up.\n\n3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:21.160\n But just, it was cool cause we tied up on the fence and just even the second, you know,\n\n3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:24.120\n is when you're rolling with somebody and you touch and you can feel what they're doing\n\n3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:25.240\n and you go, man, this guy's really good.\n\n3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:29.320\n You can feel the calm, you can feel the small minor adjustments that they're making, the\n\n3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:30.840\n subtle things that they're doing.\n\n3:03:30.840 --> 3:03:34.760\n And that was one of those things that was really neat and gratifying because you know,\n\n3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:35.320\n you never know.\n\n3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:38.600\n Sometimes people that you've heard of are a little bit less technically proficient than\n\n3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:39.000\n you thought.\n\n3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.560\n And other times you'll meet some guy that you're training like, who the hell is this\n\n3:03:41.560 --> 3:03:41.720\n guy?\n\n3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:43.480\n How have I not heard of this person?\n\n3:03:43.480 --> 3:03:47.640\n And BJ was exactly, as a jiu jitsu guy, what I would have thought.\n\n3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:51.400\n And another thing, that's another thing that bugged me about how people reacted after the\n\n3:03:51.400 --> 3:03:55.480\n fight is, you know, basically going, oh, BJ screwed up this, screwed up that.\n\n3:03:55.480 --> 3:03:57.240\n And I'm like, all right, yeah.\n\n3:03:57.240 --> 3:03:58.120\n That's so interesting.\n\n3:03:58.760 --> 3:03:59.560\n That's sad.\n\n3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:05.640\n That was, you know, one of the, and to me, I mean, as a fan of both, that was a beautiful\n\n3:04:05.640 --> 3:04:13.080\n moment as a, as a kind of passing of a torch in a sense of exceptional performance.\n\n3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:20.280\n Like another one that stands out to me, maybe you can comment, is I don't understand, well,\n\n3:04:20.280 --> 3:04:23.240\n maybe I do, why Conor McGregor gets as much hate as he does.\n\n3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:26.440\n He probably revels in it.\n\n3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:37.560\n But I think he doesn't get enough credit for Jose Aldo for the, for like, for basically,\n\n3:04:37.560 --> 3:04:44.280\n you know, knocking him out in the first few seconds of a fight.\n\n3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:47.960\n I mean, Jose is like one of the greatest fighters ever.\n\n3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:48.460\n That's true.\n\n3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:51.720\n Maybe some people can even put him in the top 10.\n\n3:04:51.720 --> 3:04:52.600\n No question.\n\n3:04:52.600 --> 3:05:01.080\n And the, like, I don't understand why it's, doesn't get as much, like Conor McGregor\n\n3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:07.080\n doesn't get as much credit as I think he deserves for that and for Eddie Alvarez and all the\n\n3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:15.480\n fights, for some reason, whenever Conor McGregor beats somebody, well, they were not that good\n\n3:05:15.480 --> 3:05:15.960\n then.\n\n3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:19.080\n Like, it means like they were, they were, something was off.\n\n3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:19.560\n Right.\n\n3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:20.760\n That's convenient, isn't it?\n\n3:05:20.760 --> 3:05:21.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:05:21.080 --> 3:05:23.320\n It's quite strange to me.\n\n3:05:23.320 --> 3:05:29.160\n But I mean, what are your thoughts on the, on Conor McGregor?\n\n3:05:29.160 --> 3:05:33.720\n Maybe one way to ask that, I'm Russian, so I'm obviously also a Khabib fan, but I'm also\n\n3:05:33.720 --> 3:05:37.000\n a Conor fan, it seems like there's not many of us who are, like, fans of both.\n\n3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:37.240\n Right.\n\n3:05:38.200 --> 3:05:39.000\n What are your thoughts?\n\n3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:39.800\n You and Artem Lobov.\n\n3:05:41.560 --> 3:05:43.240\n The two of us, which also is a good fight.\n\n3:05:45.240 --> 3:05:45.960\n Tough dude.\n\n3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:47.800\n Yeah, really, really tough dude.\n\n3:05:47.800 --> 3:05:49.640\n He's like five languages, really interesting kid.\n\n3:05:49.640 --> 3:05:52.040\n Oh, so, oh wow, I didn't know that side of it.\n\n3:05:52.040 --> 3:05:52.840\n There's a brain there.\n\n3:05:54.040 --> 3:05:57.320\n Well, on the Khabib versus Conor, what do you make of their first fight?\n\n3:05:57.880 --> 3:06:00.840\n What do you, do you agree with me that they should fight again?\n\n3:06:00.840 --> 3:06:04.840\n Because I think it would be awesome if they fought again in Moscow.\n\n3:06:04.840 --> 3:06:09.720\n And do you agree with me, I'm just going to put, say things that piss people off,\n\n3:06:09.720 --> 3:06:13.160\n but I believe is that Conor actually has a chance to beat Khabib.\n\n3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:16.120\n One, that Conor absolutely has a chance to beat Khabib.\n\n3:06:16.120 --> 3:06:19.000\n Conor has a chance to beat anyone that he steps into that ring with, and not just like\n\n3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:19.960\n a mathematical chance.\n\n3:06:19.960 --> 3:06:24.120\n You're like, oh, one of the billion, but like, you know, like he absolutely, it's funny\n\n3:06:24.120 --> 3:06:27.800\n because I won't pretend to know Conor really well, but I first met Conor in 2010 when I\n\n3:06:27.800 --> 3:06:31.080\n was teaching a seminar in, at Strait Blast Gym Ireland in Dublin.\n\n3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:36.040\n And that's actually where I first met all of the coaches that ended up being on Conor's\n\n3:06:36.040 --> 3:06:36.540\n team.\n\n3:06:37.320 --> 3:06:42.600\n You know, John Kavanaugh, Owen Roddy, Gunnar Nelson, you know, so for, I actually, I enjoyed\n\n3:06:42.600 --> 3:06:46.440\n being on Ultimate Fighter and being on Uriah Faber's team and getting to train with all\n\n3:06:46.440 --> 3:06:46.920\n the guys there.\n\n3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:50.120\n But at the same time, the people that I was actually, I knew better were actually the\n\n3:06:50.120 --> 3:06:52.040\n European side, all of Conor's coaches.\n\n3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:57.800\n And that was a neat thing because I got to, I met Conor, I didn't know who Conor, like\n\n3:06:57.800 --> 3:06:58.840\n Conor wasn't Conor at that point.\n\n3:06:58.840 --> 3:07:00.680\n Yeah, that was before his UFC debut.\n\n3:07:00.680 --> 3:07:01.880\n Oh yeah, well, well before, yeah.\n\n3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:04.680\n I think, I think he got in like 2014, maybe something like that.\n\n3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:05.180\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:05.180 --> 3:07:08.760\n And anyway, but he was doing well in Cage Warriors, winning the titles there.\n\n3:07:08.760 --> 3:07:13.640\n I think prior to that, you know, I remember going, seeing him on the show and also then\n\n3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:19.000\n getting to see him train because I competed, I was initially slated to fight David Tamer\n\n3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:22.840\n for the Ultimate Fighter finale before getting put in to fight Artem for the title for the\n\n3:07:22.840 --> 3:07:23.340\n show.\n\n3:07:23.340 --> 3:07:27.640\n So I went over to Ireland to train for a couple of days and basically it was neat to watch\n\n3:07:27.640 --> 3:07:28.600\n him, watch him work.\n\n3:07:28.600 --> 3:07:33.640\n I mean, man is focused and trains a lot and very, very smart and very, very hardworking.\n\n3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:40.520\n And I think a lot of times people get stuck in the, in this, you know, and they almost\n\n3:07:40.520 --> 3:07:44.920\n want to believe that this was lucky or this, this person, you know, like they're not working\n\n3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:45.240\n that hard.\n\n3:07:45.240 --> 3:07:45.960\n They're just out there.\n\n3:07:45.960 --> 3:07:49.560\n They got there with their mouth and that's, that's just not the case.\n\n3:07:49.560 --> 3:07:52.840\n And you know, I don't know what it's like, you know, obviously Connors very well off\n\n3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:55.480\n right now and I don't know how hard, how seriously he's training, what he's doing.\n\n3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:59.960\n I can't speak to any of that, but there's no question that he has skills to be dangerous.\n\n3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:03.480\n And one of the funny things, obviously the Khabib fight when Khabib was a great fighter\n\n3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:07.400\n and also has the chance to beat anyone in that ring at any given time.\n\n3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:14.760\n But there's, there was a Conner, you know, it's a one that he can, he can put anybody\n\n3:08:14.760 --> 3:08:16.040\n away.\n\n3:08:16.040 --> 3:08:19.400\n And as you mentioned, I think that he doesn't get the credit for the Eddie Alvarez fight.\n\n3:08:19.400 --> 3:08:20.760\n He doesn't get the credit for the Jose Aldo fight.\n\n3:08:20.760 --> 3:08:22.120\n Cause it was almost so much of a letdown.\n\n3:08:22.120 --> 3:08:24.760\n I remember that happened the same weekend that I did the ultimate fighter finale.\n\n3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:26.840\n And you're like, all right, wait, what?\n\n3:08:28.760 --> 3:08:29.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:08:29.240 --> 3:08:32.280\n It almost doesn't feel like a fight happening, but we mentioned Miyamoto Musashi.\n\n3:08:32.280 --> 3:08:36.120\n I mean, Musashi was famous for the way he poked and prodded that people with what he\n\n3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:39.320\n was doing, whether overtly or not, it's like, Oh, we're supposed to fight to the death.\n\n3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:41.480\n And, uh, you know, at 3 PM tomorrow, great.\n\n3:08:41.480 --> 3:08:43.560\n 4 PM rolls around, I'm just not there.\n\n3:08:43.560 --> 3:08:44.040\n Five.\n\n3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:47.000\n I mean, you remember all the, all the antics and nonsense that Conner was pulling prior\n\n3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.360\n to that, like speaking personally, that's not, it's not something I would feel comfortable\n\n3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:52.120\n doing, but it's like, everyone's different.\n\n3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:55.240\n And the effect that it had on, on Jose was, I mean, beyond evident.\n\n3:08:55.240 --> 3:08:59.320\n When was the last time Jose started the, started the fight with leaping left hand,\n\n3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:01.240\n leaping right hand, you're like, wait, what?\n\n3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:06.680\n And then he was obviously, you know, living rent free and in Jose's head at that point.\n\n3:09:06.680 --> 3:09:11.640\n And that was a combination of psychological, you know, ability and, and, and wherewithal\n\n3:09:11.640 --> 3:09:12.680\n and then physical.\n\n3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:15.960\n And it reminded me of the way Muhammad Ali would, would bother people and whatnot.\n\n3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:21.640\n And, uh, the fact that he's a polarizing figure, um, I think makes some people not give him\n\n3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:22.120\n his due.\n\n3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:27.080\n And then at the same time, sometimes certain fans may be go overboard, but, uh, they remember\n\n3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:30.600\n the knee that Ben Askren got knocked out with by Masoudal.\n\n3:09:30.600 --> 3:09:34.440\n I mean, that was an amazing, unbelievable thing, but three inches to the right, three\n\n3:09:34.440 --> 3:09:38.360\n inches to the left, I guess, whichever side his head wasn't, could have been squarer.\n\n3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:43.160\n But, uh, and that fight starts with Ben Askren on top of you in the first five seconds.\n\n3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:48.840\n Well, Connor ran and threw a knee just like that at Khabib and Khabib got right around\n\n3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:48.840\n it.\n\n3:09:48.840 --> 3:09:50.120\n That could have easily gone the other way.\n\n3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:53.480\n Can you imagine what would have happened if after the, after coming back from boxing,\n\n3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:58.840\n um, after coming back from, from the Mayweather fight, Connor, in the first 10 seconds, it's\n\n3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:04.600\n Khabib in the first 10 seconds, it's over and you're like, he would, it would have been\n\n3:10:04.600 --> 3:10:08.680\n intolerable, but basically, like, you know, but see, here's the thing.\n\n3:10:08.680 --> 3:10:10.360\n Let me actually push back slightly.\n\n3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:18.600\n Uh, I mean, to the fans, correct me if I'm wrong, but Connor seems to cause I've competed\n\n3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:20.440\n a lot and like there's a tension.\n\n3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:26.040\n There's a negativity sometimes depending on the opponent and there's a respect afterwards\n\n3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:30.600\n that happens, like when you understand that there's a deep like respect and almost like\n\n3:10:30.600 --> 3:10:31.560\n love for each other.\n\n3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:37.160\n Like, I always seen that in Connor, like all the trash talk afterwards.\n\n3:10:37.160 --> 3:10:37.560\n Yes.\n\n3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:39.560\n There's a, it's, it's a subtle thing.\n\n3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:42.040\n You can't always see it, but there's a respect like.\n\n3:10:42.040 --> 3:10:42.920\n I agree.\n\n3:10:42.920 --> 3:10:51.400\n And like that, I almost on the Khabib side, I almost feel like Khabib really took it personally.\n\n3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:54.200\n He did, he didn't, he lost the respect for Connor.\n\n3:10:54.200 --> 3:10:56.440\n I thought, I thought the whole time Connor had the respect.\n\n3:10:56.440 --> 3:11:01.160\n So I, I, what I wanted to say is like, if Connor won that fight, like rock Khabib, I\n\n3:11:01.160 --> 3:11:04.520\n could see like, I wouldn't see trash talking.\n\n3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:07.000\n I could see like trash talking stop right there.\n\n3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.760\n I think so too, but at the same time, I'm sure you recall like Connor, Connor crossing\n\n3:11:10.760 --> 3:11:14.680\n some pretty personal territory, you know, both religiously and, and also familiarly\n\n3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:15.640\n with, uh, with Khabib.\n\n3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.880\n And it's, you know, I mean, I think it's the sort of thing that, I don't know, it's, it's\n\n3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:21.720\n an interesting, that's one of the reasons.\n\n3:11:21.720 --> 3:11:28.040\n Like you have to know the diff so obviously I know the, the, the Khabib, uh, the Dagestani\n\n3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:29.960\n people, they don't play around like that.\n\n3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:31.960\n They don't play around like that.\n\n3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:36.040\n You know, I mean, they take offense to basically, I mean, you, you don't do that.\n\n3:11:36.040 --> 3:11:42.680\n So, uh, so like Connor didn't, maybe he did it on purpose or maybe he wasn't even just\n\n3:11:42.680 --> 3:11:47.640\n aware of, of, uh, it was cultural differences of the box he opened.\n\n3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:52.440\n Like you, you can talk to Floyd Mayweather, you can, you can go anywhere with him.\n\n3:11:52.440 --> 3:11:58.840\n You can, you can say the most offensive things, but with, uh, with Khabib, it's, it's, yeah,\n\n3:11:58.840 --> 3:12:03.400\n hard lines, but you, uh, I mean, a lot of people ask, I know you're a featherweight,\n\n3:12:03.400 --> 3:12:11.400\n but if you were to, uh, face, it feels like Khabib was one of the hardest puzzles to solve\n\n3:12:11.400 --> 3:12:13.960\n in, in all of mixed martial arts.\n\n3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:19.800\n If you were to face Khabib, do you think, how would you go about solving that puzzle?\n\n3:12:19.800 --> 3:12:23.800\n Like almost the question is almost from a Jiu Jitsu perspective too.\n\n3:12:23.800 --> 3:12:28.840\n What do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position, especially on\n\n3:12:28.840 --> 3:12:32.840\n top, very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position.\n\n3:12:32.840 --> 3:12:38.280\n Like let's say, so forget maybe striking on the ground.\n\n3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:40.360\n How do you solve that guy?\n\n3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.680\n Like what do you do with your guard if you get taken down or do you create an entire\n\n3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:49.080\n system of not getting taken down or escaping is like, what, what ideas do you have for\n\n3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:50.080\n that?\n\n3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:53.080\n Well, I guess I would say in my mind, fighting is a game of trading energy.\n\n3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:58.240\n Um, kind of, uh, you know, there's two, there's two things, there's damage and there's energy.\n\n3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:02.360\n So like when I say energy and being like, uh, tired, not tired, how much, how much gas\n\n3:13:02.360 --> 3:13:03.360\n you've got.\n\n3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:05.880\n Um, and then damage counts obviously as well.\n\n3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:09.000\n Um, you could be feeling, I could be feeling great and then you get to kick me in the head\n\n3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:10.560\n hard, really hard three times.\n\n3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:12.080\n It doesn't matter that I could get up and run a mile.\n\n3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:13.240\n I can't get up.\n\n3:13:13.240 --> 3:13:18.960\n So anyway, um, you know, I, I think what Khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look\n\n3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:20.560\n like it could be an amalgamated fight.\n\n3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:25.960\n Um, he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking\n\n3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:30.280\n the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive is his control is.\n\n3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:33.820\n Um, his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen in the UFC.\n\n3:13:33.820 --> 3:13:34.820\n It's fantastic.\n\n3:13:34.820 --> 3:13:40.220\n Um, but, uh, that poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain\n\n3:13:40.220 --> 3:13:44.320\n amount of space and try to hurt them on the feed because unless they're able to inflict\n\n3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:48.400\n an adequate amount of damage, they're going to each time, let's say for instance, let's\n\n3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.320\n say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point.\n\n3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:55.000\n Um, if every single time Khabib takes you down, you get right back up.\n\n3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:58.680\n It's not that big a deal, um, because it's actually more, we've all experienced this.\n\n3:13:58.680 --> 3:14:01.480\n Let's say you and I are rolling, you tap me 15 times in one round.\n\n3:14:01.480 --> 3:14:02.480\n Who's more tired?\n\n3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:03.480\n Probably you are.\n\n3:14:03.480 --> 3:14:04.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:05.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:08.240\n My ass so badly that, that it's like, you're the only one working, but, um,\n\n3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:13.560\n So if you're comfortable with the up and down of it, like being taken down.\n\n3:14:13.560 --> 3:14:18.840\n If you're, if you don't, if you don't get hurt badly or tired on the bottom, you have\n\n3:14:18.840 --> 3:14:23.520\n a chance, but that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feet before he gets ahold of you.\n\n3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:24.520\n Um,\n\n3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:25.520\n That's a lot.\n\n3:14:25.520 --> 3:14:26.520\n That's a lot to ask.\n\n3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:27.520\n That's a lot to ask.\n\n3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:28.520\n That's difficult to do.\n\n3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:32.540\n It seemed actually like Connor, it seemed like it when he was being kind of taken down\n\n3:14:32.540 --> 3:14:37.680\n or the, the take down attempts against Khabib, he seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole\n\n3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:38.680\n thing.\n\n3:14:38.680 --> 3:14:39.680\n I thought he was doing well, actually.\n\n3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:42.320\n I think that particularly for the first round, I thought he did a very good job.\n\n3:14:42.320 --> 3:14:47.260\n It's just one of those things that I think like, uh, Khabib being the fights taking place\n\n3:14:47.260 --> 3:14:49.560\n in Khabib's world in large part.\n\n3:14:49.560 --> 3:14:53.760\n And I mean, set aside that one giant, uh, was it right hand that, that Khabib hit Connor\n\n3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:56.040\n with it, by the way, Connor reacted like an absolute champion.\n\n3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:01.400\n He got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his eyes went right back on Khabib.\n\n3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:03.560\n It was immediate positive, great response.\n\n3:15:03.560 --> 3:15:06.960\n So even though that was, I think that was a bit of a surprising thing, Connor reacted\n\n3:15:06.960 --> 3:15:07.960\n really, really well.\n\n3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:11.880\n But if you're going to be on bottom with Khabib for four rounds, that's going to be tough.\n\n3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:15.840\n And also Connor's a way better grappler than people like to give him credit for, but he's\n\n3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:20.520\n not the type of grappler that can do that can, that can, that's too tall of an order,\n\n3:15:20.520 --> 3:15:23.560\n but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would have a much, much better\n\n3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:26.560\n shot at, uh, being able to weather that type of a storm.\n\n3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:30.440\n Do you see yourself being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm?\n\n3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:39.160\n Well, I guess I can remember being, being, being, being savagely beaten is very relaxing.\n\n3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:45.280\n The time that the timing of that answer was like, okay, that's a dumb question.\n\n3:15:45.280 --> 3:15:51.840\n No, that's ultimately the goal of Jiu Jitsu is to, um, be relaxed to the fire.\n\n3:15:51.840 --> 3:15:52.840\n For sure.\n\n3:15:52.840 --> 3:15:55.960\n And remember like every UFC fighter, I win all hypothetical matchups.\n\n3:15:55.960 --> 3:15:59.440\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n3:15:59.440 --> 3:16:06.160\n Uh, since, uh, I'm one to ask ridiculous questions and we've been talking about sci fi and all\n\n3:16:06.160 --> 3:16:07.160\n that kind of stuff.\n\n3:16:07.160 --> 3:16:12.320\n Let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees about, certainly with me is, uh,\n\n3:16:12.320 --> 3:16:18.920\n who are the top five greatest MMA fighters of all time and, um, um, why is Fedor number\n\n3:16:18.920 --> 3:16:19.920\n one?\n\n3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:20.920\n Okay.\n\n3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:21.920\n Well, first off, Fedor is number one.\n\n3:16:21.920 --> 3:16:22.920\n Oh really?\n\n3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:23.920\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:24.920\n Right there with you.\n\n3:16:24.920 --> 3:16:25.920\n Really?\n\n3:16:25.920 --> 3:16:26.920\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:27.920\n Talk about people that just get completely underappreciated.\n\n3:16:27.920 --> 3:16:30.440\n He's never been in the, uh, like he's never succeeded in the UFC.\n\n3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:31.680\n It's not his fault.\n\n3:16:31.680 --> 3:16:35.480\n It came along after him at the time that, at the time that Fedor was at his height,\n\n3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:38.440\n the UFC was not where it was at for heavyweight fighting.\n\n3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:42.800\n I mean, not that there weren't good heavyweights there, but Fedor, Fedor was unbelievable.\n\n3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:43.800\n You know what I mean?\n\n3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:47.320\n You remember, I mean, Minotaur Noguera, I was a massive fan of him.\n\n3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:52.060\n I still remember watching, uh, what is it pride 2004 when, when Noguera fought Cro Cop\n\n3:16:52.060 --> 3:16:56.680\n and got blasted with that left kick and dropped with like seconds left in the first round.\n\n3:16:56.680 --> 3:16:59.600\n Pride was great cause he had a 10 minute first round and that five minute second, which again\n\n3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:02.360\n materially alters, alters the fight big time.\n\n3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:05.200\n And you know, just the texture of the fight is just totally, it's borderline a different\n\n3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:09.000\n sport, you know, then, then getting a five, a pause and a five.\n\n3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:12.160\n But anyway, uh, similar sports, like one of those swimming things where they have nine\n\n3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:14.240\n gold medals for different types of swimming, right?\n\n3:17:14.240 --> 3:17:15.240\n But still swimming.\n\n3:17:15.240 --> 3:17:16.240\n But anyway, um,\n\n3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:17.240\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:17:17.240 --> 3:17:18.240\n They would disagree.\n\n3:17:18.240 --> 3:17:19.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:17:19.240 --> 3:17:20.240\n I don't mean, I'm not trying to.\n\n3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:21.240\n They specialize in that.\n\n3:17:21.240 --> 3:17:22.240\n Of course.\n\n3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:23.240\n It's so, it's totally true.\n\n3:17:23.240 --> 3:17:24.240\n 10, 10 minutes is different than five minutes.\n\n3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:25.240\n Sorry.\n\n3:17:25.240 --> 3:17:27.160\n Don't take, don't, don't, don't drown me swimmers.\n\n3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:28.160\n I don't swim very well.\n\n3:17:28.160 --> 3:17:32.520\n It's easy for me to, easy for me to downplay it, but anyway, um, uh, yeah.\n\n3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:33.520\n And then no,\n\n3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:36.080\n Better than, uh, John Jones, like the modern era.\n\n3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:40.160\n Well, I mean, I guess it's, it's tough to compete, to compare across eras.\n\n3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:44.480\n It would be like going and saying like, Oh man, how, how would such and such great grappler\n\n3:17:44.480 --> 3:17:47.520\n from today fare against someone from 1995?\n\n3:17:47.520 --> 3:17:52.960\n I'm like, well, probably pretty well for them, depending upon who they are, what's going\n\n3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:53.960\n on.\n\n3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:57.080\n There's some people that would, their skill sets might transition across eras, but a lot\n\n3:17:57.080 --> 3:17:59.000\n of times not, but that's not fair.\n\n3:17:59.000 --> 3:18:04.120\n We get the, they'll be like comparing Spartans to modern day, you know, like army guys.\n\n3:18:04.120 --> 3:18:05.120\n You're like, well, who's going to win?\n\n3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:07.640\n I'm like, well, did modern day army guys get modern day weapons?\n\n3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:11.880\n Well, yeah, but who's the toughest ruggedest group of people at the very least?\n\n3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:14.840\n So I guess it's, it's tough to say, but at least in my mind, the people that I think\n\n3:18:14.840 --> 3:18:20.120\n about for great fighters, their, their, their quality of opposition, um, their level of\n\n3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:23.520\n like lasting and like success, their level of lasting innovation.\n\n3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:26.920\n Like the courage that they have to demonstrate, because again, it's like being a big fish\n\n3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:28.680\n in a small pond takes no courage.\n\n3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:32.520\n Doesn't mean that there's nothing there, but it just requires something a little bit different.\n\n3:18:32.520 --> 3:18:34.840\n So Kazushi Sakuraba is one of my guys too.\n\n3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:39.160\n Um, BJ Penn also, I mean, BJ Penn fought Lyoto Machida.\n\n3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:40.400\n That's insane.\n\n3:18:40.400 --> 3:18:42.800\n You know, it's, that was a time, it was a different sport.\n\n3:18:42.800 --> 3:18:45.600\n It was a different time in the sport where, you know, they were, some guys were, were\n\n3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:50.040\n bouncing around doing different things, but let's, so I guess the Gracie family, it's,\n\n3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:54.880\n I mean, they never had an in like, obviously Hoist was there, um, but they never, and that\n\n3:18:54.880 --> 3:18:56.320\n was a definitely a different sport.\n\n3:18:56.320 --> 3:18:57.800\n Weight classes being open, things like that.\n\n3:18:57.800 --> 3:18:59.760\n Yeah, but you have to say that Hoist is up there.\n\n3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:00.760\n Oh, no question.\n\n3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:01.760\n One of the greatest ever.\n\n3:19:01.760 --> 3:19:02.760\n I think so too.\n\n3:19:02.760 --> 3:19:06.600\n And again, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you, um, if it weren't for him.\n\n3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:11.880\n So the Gracie family as a whole, but I mean, who's the better, I mean, I think Hoist would\n\n3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:15.440\n tell you himself probably that, that Hickson would have handled business back then, but\n\n3:19:15.440 --> 3:19:16.440\n they didn't put him in.\n\n3:19:16.440 --> 3:19:19.060\n So again, he's the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter that we saw\n\n3:19:19.060 --> 3:19:20.060\n do his business.\n\n3:19:20.060 --> 3:19:21.480\n So Hoist up there for sure.\n\n3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:26.080\n What about, so this is like, nobody seems to agree with me on this, but like this connects\n\n3:19:26.080 --> 3:19:28.200\n to soccer again and Messi.\n\n3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:36.040\n It seems that people value like how long you've been a champion, how many like defenses of\n\n3:19:36.040 --> 3:19:39.340\n the championship that you've had successfully.\n\n3:19:39.340 --> 3:19:43.760\n To me, I highly value singular moments of genius.\n\n3:19:43.760 --> 3:19:49.640\n So like, like, I, I don't, like, if you look at Conor McGregor, he hasn't, I guess, held,\n\n3:19:49.640 --> 3:19:51.640\n I've been a champion very long, very much.\n\n3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:53.120\n Well, he didn't defend either title, right?\n\n3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:58.280\n He didn't defend any other, uh, either of the titles, but like, if you talk, and same\n\n3:19:58.280 --> 3:20:04.260\n with Messi, if you look at, uh, Lionel Messi, there's just moments of brilliance unlike\n\n3:20:04.260 --> 3:20:07.640\n any other in history for both Conor and Messi.\n\n3:20:07.640 --> 3:20:11.040\n And people don't seem to give credits like, well, how many world cups have you won?\n\n3:20:11.040 --> 3:20:15.720\n But to me, like, why is it about this arbitrary world cup thing or championship thing?\n\n3:20:15.720 --> 3:20:17.440\n I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around, right?\n\n3:20:17.440 --> 3:20:18.440\n It's like the NFL combine.\n\n3:20:18.440 --> 3:20:20.960\n When was, I mean, yeah, numbers.\n\n3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:24.760\n It's something that, well, again, if I go and if I pick Tom Brady in the first round,\n\n3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:27.560\n you know, and it works out, they call me a genius.\n\n3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:31.600\n If I had to pick Tom Brady in the first round after his combine and it doesn't work out,\n\n3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:34.760\n I get fired and I'm never hired again, I have to work, work somewhere else.\n\n3:20:34.760 --> 3:20:37.520\n But it's like, I'm insulating myself from criticism.\n\n3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:40.680\n I think almost if I go by the numbers, well, he had more bench presses.\n\n3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:45.640\n It's like, how, how many times have the guys that are like the super studs in the, uh,\n\n3:20:45.640 --> 3:20:49.960\n in the NFL combine ever been on the greatest players in the NFL history, in NFL history,\n\n3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:52.160\n like zero or close to zero.\n\n3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:56.020\n And even if, even if there's some, it's certainly not a one to one correlation.\n\n3:20:56.020 --> 3:20:57.020\n So it's so funny though.\n\n3:20:57.020 --> 3:20:59.920\n I think it's just like, how many, how long, how many days did he hold the title?\n\n3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:02.640\n Oh, your title reign was X times longer.\n\n3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:03.640\n That means nothing.\n\n3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:06.620\n So if we wanted to find greatest fighter ever, like you said, I think individual moments\n\n3:21:06.620 --> 3:21:09.300\n of like, like that was transcended, that was different.\n\n3:21:09.300 --> 3:21:12.880\n That was something else because people can win or lose for any number of different reasons.\n\n3:21:12.880 --> 3:21:14.720\n And that it's an interesting thing.\n\n3:21:14.720 --> 3:21:19.640\n Again, I don't blame Argentina, not winning the world cup on messy, you know, that's not\n\n3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:20.640\n fair.\n\n3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:24.720\n You know, how many times has, you know, I mean, I use the, I remember when a Trent\n\n3:21:24.720 --> 3:21:28.960\n Ilfer was the quarterback for the, uh, the Baltimore Ravens and they had such a strong\n\n3:21:28.960 --> 3:21:29.960\n defense.\n\n3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:32.520\n I'm not trying to pick on Trent Ilfer, but it's like they, they had such a strong defense\n\n3:21:32.520 --> 3:21:33.720\n that they were to make it.\n\n3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:38.960\n That was the Ray Lewis, you know, Chris McAllister era, you know, and they, they won, they won\n\n3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:39.960\n the super bowl.\n\n3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:44.680\n I don't think anyone is going to say that, you know, Trent Dilfer is a better quarterback\n\n3:21:44.680 --> 3:21:51.000\n than, you know, or put him in the same category as Dan Marino, but he got the W he's got the,\n\n3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:52.000\n he's got the super ring.\n\n3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:54.320\n How many times, let's use March Madness or super, I love it.\n\n3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:57.320\n Like that, that guy always makes the finals, but he just never gets it done.\n\n3:21:57.320 --> 3:22:00.920\n So let me get this straight, getting to the finals nine times doesn't count because you\n\n3:22:00.920 --> 3:22:02.400\n didn't win the end game.\n\n3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:05.560\n I'm not saying it wouldn't be better, but that guy won the game once he got over the\n\n3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:06.560\n hump.\n\n3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:07.560\n Well, how many other times was he in the finals?\n\n3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:08.560\n Zero.\n\n3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:09.560\n All right.\n\n3:22:09.560 --> 3:22:10.560\n Yeah.\n\n3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:11.560\n It's interesting what we, yeah.\n\n3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:16.240\n We were obsessed with these numbers, like, um, well, cause we can't assess their method,\n\n3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:17.240\n right?\n\n3:22:17.240 --> 3:22:19.680\n Well, I think most of the time, most of us can't assess the method of anything.\n\n3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:21.800\n I'm it's like, Oh, look at that guy do X Y swimming.\n\n3:22:21.800 --> 3:22:23.680\n I'm like, how do I know Michael Phelps is great.\n\n3:22:23.680 --> 3:22:24.680\n I don't know.\n\n3:22:24.680 --> 3:22:25.680\n It was faster.\n\n3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:28.880\n I can't look at his technique and say anything other than, well, that's way better than anything\n\n3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:32.860\n I know how to do, but I can't say the difference between him and the next guy.\n\n3:22:32.860 --> 3:22:36.600\n So I guess that's, I wonder if it's like, I need a concrete identifier and a lot of\n\n3:22:36.600 --> 3:22:38.360\n times people don't like saying, I don't know.\n\n3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:43.640\n And most people won't put like a Ronda Rousey in the top, even 20 or 50 of, but like she\n\n3:22:43.640 --> 3:22:47.760\n changed more than, more than almost anybody else.\n\n3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:52.080\n She changed the martial arts history.\n\n3:22:52.080 --> 3:22:59.760\n I don't know if that even, I don't think I'm exaggerating that she, she made it okay for\n\n3:22:59.760 --> 3:23:06.640\n women to be fighters and that, and that changed the way we see like, she's one of the great\n\n3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:13.880\n feminists of our time in a weird kind of way that like, I don't know.\n\n3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:18.920\n Maybe I'm just a Ronda Rousey fan, but the, yeah, the, but she's not in the conversation\n\n3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:20.640\n because then you start converting into numbers.\n\n3:23:20.640 --> 3:23:22.120\n Well, how many did she win?\n\n3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:25.160\n Is she among the greatest fighters or did she do the greatest things?\n\n3:23:25.160 --> 3:23:26.160\n You know what I mean?\n\n3:23:26.160 --> 3:23:30.160\n I don't, I think it's something, I mean, obviously Ronda is a great Sudoku who was competing\n\n3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:34.160\n in MMA at a time when a lot of the girls like, where did you get your skills in the Olympics\n\n3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:35.160\n or where'd you get yours?\n\n3:23:35.160 --> 3:23:36.160\n High school.\n\n3:23:36.160 --> 3:23:38.320\n I mean, they're going to, the Olympic girls going to beat you up.\n\n3:23:38.320 --> 3:23:43.000\n But I guess that, that doesn't diminish her, just that accomplishment is what it is.\n\n3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:48.360\n I don't have to, I don't, Fedor is not diminished by the fact that he would like, if he were\n\n3:23:48.360 --> 3:23:52.600\n to fight Stephen Mayochis right now, it probably wouldn't go great or that John Jones exists.\n\n3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:57.120\n I don't now have to like knock Fedor's accomplishments down or say, oh, because BJ Penn or so and\n\n3:23:57.120 --> 3:24:01.480\n so let's say has a mixed record at this point that somehow invalidates the things that they've\n\n3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:02.480\n done before.\n\n3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:05.680\n I guess it kind of brings us back to a lot of the other people we've talked about, the\n\n3:24:05.680 --> 3:24:09.040\n fact that the brilliant people throughout history that we love or some of the monsters\n\n3:24:09.040 --> 3:24:13.560\n throughout history that we rightly revile in a lot of cases were complicated people\n\n3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:15.540\n and their legacy is more than just one thing.\n\n3:24:15.540 --> 3:24:18.920\n And someone doing something amazing doesn't invalid, doesn't mean they didn't do anything\n\n3:24:18.920 --> 3:24:19.920\n bad.\n\n3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:23.360\n And someone doing terrible things doesn't, doesn't mean that, doesn't invalidate the,\n\n3:24:23.360 --> 3:24:24.600\n the positives that they did.\n\n3:24:24.600 --> 3:24:29.440\n But I guess we fighting the urge to put people in one category and same with ourselves.\n\n3:24:29.440 --> 3:24:30.840\n I think that's why people get depressed.\n\n3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:32.440\n Oh, I'm good right now.\n\n3:24:32.440 --> 3:24:33.960\n Oh, I'm bad right now.\n\n3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:37.200\n Versus hey, we're all at work in progress and we're trying to do X number of things\n\n3:24:37.200 --> 3:24:39.680\n and legacy is a tough thing to figure out anyway.\n\n3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:42.320\n And it's all speculative.\n\n3:24:42.320 --> 3:24:49.520\n Last time or no on Reddit, you said that last time too, that you don't experience much fear\n\n3:24:49.520 --> 3:24:50.520\n before fights.\n\n3:24:50.520 --> 3:24:53.480\n I'd like to ask you a couple of Mike Tyson things, if it's okay.\n\n3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:54.480\n It's just interesting to me.\n\n3:24:54.480 --> 3:24:55.480\n Maybe I'm just weird.\n\n3:24:55.480 --> 3:25:01.540\n So there's a, I don't know if you've seen this clip of Tyson talking about how he feels\n\n3:25:01.540 --> 3:25:08.600\n leading up to a fight that he's kind of overtaken with fear, but as he gets closer and closer\n\n3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:12.280\n and closer to the ring, his confidence grows.\n\n3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:14.840\n Have you seen the clip?\n\n3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:15.840\n I'm aware of it.\n\n3:25:15.840 --> 3:25:16.840\n Okay.\n\n3:25:16.840 --> 3:25:17.840\n I haven't seen it in a while.\n\n3:25:17.840 --> 3:25:18.840\n Here, let me play it for you.\n\n3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:21.840\n I think George St. Pierre said something similar to me one time.\n\n3:25:21.840 --> 3:25:27.920\n While I'm in the dressing room, five minutes before I come out, my gloves are laced up.\n\n3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:28.920\n I'm breaking my gloves down.\n\n3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:33.080\n I'm pushing the lever on the back of my leg, breaking the middle of the glove so my knuckle\n\n3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:34.080\n pierced through the lever.\n\n3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:38.360\n I feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves on the Everlast box.\n\n3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:42.280\n When I come out, I have supreme confidence, but I'm scared to death.\n\n3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:43.280\n I'm totally afraid.\n\n3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:44.280\n I'm afraid of everything.\n\n3:25:44.280 --> 3:25:45.280\n I'm afraid of losing.\n\n3:25:45.280 --> 3:25:48.560\n I'm afraid of being humiliated, but I'm just totally confident.\n\n3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:50.840\n The closer I get to the ring, the more confidence I get.\n\n3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:52.760\n The closer, the more confidence I get.\n\n3:25:52.760 --> 3:25:54.960\n The closer, the more confidence I get.\n\n3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:57.080\n All during my training, I've been afraid of this man.\n\n3:25:57.080 --> 3:25:59.360\n I thought this man might be capable of beating me.\n\n3:25:59.360 --> 3:26:03.720\n I've dreamed of him beating me, but I always stayed afraid of him.\n\n3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:06.360\n But the closer I get to the ring, I'm more confident.\n\n3:26:06.360 --> 3:26:08.280\n Once I'm in the ring, I'm a god.\n\n3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:09.280\n No one can beat me.\n\n3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:10.280\n I'm a god.\n\n3:26:10.280 --> 3:26:16.640\n I mean, first of all, he's cognizant of both his demons and whatever the hell ideas he\n\n3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:17.640\n has about violence.\n\n3:26:17.640 --> 3:26:18.640\n It's so interesting.\n\n3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:25.080\n Is there something about the tension that he's describing about being confident and\n\n3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:27.040\n scared that resonates with you?\n\n3:26:27.040 --> 3:26:32.120\n Or do you hold to this idea that you've kind of spoken about before that you're really\n\n3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:33.120\n not afraid?\n\n3:26:33.120 --> 3:26:36.440\n No, I can appreciate what he's saying.\n\n3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:42.240\n I think that I can speak to feeling concerned about, let's say, for instance, if you feel\n\n3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:48.480\n a certain way, I think people are a lot more like computers than we like to admit.\n\n3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:52.720\n And just because a lot of times I can't parse what's going on and why doesn't mean that\n\n3:26:52.720 --> 3:26:55.720\n it doesn't make sense.\n\n3:26:55.720 --> 3:26:59.960\n And I think that, at least in the times, if I'm concerned about a situation or about a\n\n3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:05.200\n person or about something happening prior to the fight, I'm like, there's a reason.\n\n3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:06.200\n There was a reason.\n\n3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.760\n I don't have to push that down and bury it.\n\n3:27:07.760 --> 3:27:08.760\n There's a reason.\n\n3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:09.760\n Why?\n\n3:27:09.760 --> 3:27:10.760\n What have I not thought about?\n\n3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:11.760\n What have I not done?\n\n3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:12.760\n What am I missing?\n\n3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:13.760\n Why am I feeling this way?\n\n3:27:13.760 --> 3:27:17.240\n As you mentioned, for yourself prior, you'd be like, why am I feeling like this?\n\n3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:20.680\n I don't do this very well in certain aspects of my life now that I mention it or now that\n\n3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:21.680\n I think about it.\n\n3:27:21.680 --> 3:27:24.920\n But when it comes to competing, I think I do an all right job and I'm trying to learn\n\n3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:25.920\n to be better.\n\n3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:29.920\n And it's going like, well, why do I, if I feel this way, there's a reason.\n\n3:27:29.920 --> 3:27:30.920\n Okay.\n\n3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:31.920\n Am I thinking about this the wrong way?\n\n3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:33.640\n Have I not adequately prepared for something?\n\n3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:38.680\n I have to address it and then maybe I'll be up for four hours that night, like extra hours\n\n3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:42.640\n thinking what have I not addressed, watching sparring, watching this, watching that.\n\n3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:49.520\n And then when I am thinking about things more accurately or when I've addressed what that\n\n3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:53.960\n concern was, I feel any of that concern kind of dissipate.\n\n3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:59.240\n And I guess if I honestly thought that, I guess when it comes to, I know I'm going to\n\n3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:03.660\n die at a certain point, obviously, I'm going to get hurt, pain happens.\n\n3:28:03.660 --> 3:28:08.160\n But the pain of loss would be nothing compared to the, or the pain of injury would be nothing\n\n3:28:08.160 --> 3:28:12.440\n compared to the pain of running away.\n\n3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:18.320\n And so I guess if I think about where's my value, it's like I feel like I'm a winner\n\n3:28:18.320 --> 3:28:21.960\n and every single time I step into that ring and fight with everything that I have, I can't\n\n3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:23.680\n promise that I'll win my next fight.\n\n3:28:23.680 --> 3:28:28.160\n I know that I have the skills and the tools to beat anyone in grappling or in mixed martial\n\n3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:29.160\n arts at this point.\n\n3:28:29.160 --> 3:28:33.920\n It's just, I know that for certain, I've trained with enough people, I've competed with enough\n\n3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:36.040\n people, I know where I stand.\n\n3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:39.840\n But I also know that I'm not perfect and also the better fighter, even if I perceived that\n\n3:28:39.840 --> 3:28:43.720\n I was that thing, doesn't win on the night.\n\n3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:47.000\n The man who fights better wins on the night.\n\n3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:53.360\n And if I give credence in my mind to only the person that's won has value versus going,\n\n3:28:53.360 --> 3:28:54.440\n what's your process?\n\n3:28:54.440 --> 3:28:56.080\n What's your path through this?\n\n3:28:56.080 --> 3:28:57.080\n How are you going about this?\n\n3:28:57.080 --> 3:28:58.120\n How are you thinking about this?\n\n3:28:58.120 --> 3:28:59.960\n How are you behaving?\n\n3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:05.480\n Then if I can focus on the process, then I will respect my opponent and I will respect\n\n3:29:05.480 --> 3:29:12.520\n myself and I'll respect anyone that behaves with a certain level of consistency to that.\n\n3:29:12.520 --> 3:29:16.540\n And they could win, there's plenty of winners in history that are shitbags and there's plenty\n\n3:29:16.540 --> 3:29:18.440\n of losers that are not.\n\n3:29:18.440 --> 3:29:22.240\n But winning doesn't make you a bad or good person and losing doesn't make you good by\n\n3:29:22.240 --> 3:29:25.000\n default either or bad by default.\n\n3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:30.040\n And I think that that can be the truth socially, that can be the truth athletically and academically.\n\n3:29:30.040 --> 3:29:31.040\n So I guess...\n\n3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:37.840\n Is there a primal fear though, like a primal fear of getting hurt?\n\n3:29:37.840 --> 3:29:47.080\n The running away and not facing the threat long term is the bigger pain than any pain\n\n3:29:47.080 --> 3:29:50.160\n you can experience in the fight.\n\n3:29:50.160 --> 3:29:51.160\n That's pretty powerful.\n\n3:29:51.160 --> 3:29:55.440\n But what about the violence of, I mean, you don't have that on your face, but like, I\n\n3:29:55.440 --> 3:29:59.320\n don't know if you've also seen Tyson talk about, he was on Rogan recently and he was\n\n3:29:59.320 --> 3:30:08.800\n talking about, he was trying to psychoanalyze himself about why he enjoys violence so much.\n\n3:30:08.800 --> 3:30:10.680\n I mean, he called it orgasmic.\n\n3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:13.680\n I don't know if, have you seen that clip?\n\n3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:14.680\n I haven't.\n\n3:30:14.680 --> 3:30:15.680\n Okay.\n\n3:30:15.680 --> 3:30:19.840\n We're playing it because I can, I need to, because Trump also retweeted it, which is\n\n3:30:19.840 --> 3:30:20.840\n hilarious.\n\n3:30:20.840 --> 3:30:28.880\n I don't know how to contextualize that our president retweeted the clip of Tyson saying...\n\n3:30:28.880 --> 3:30:32.400\n Maybe he's just doing like, they're not, it's like, I'm going to throw him a curve ball.\n\n3:30:32.400 --> 3:30:33.800\n No one's going to have any idea what that is.\n\n3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:36.360\n But yeah, he did no explanation, just, here you go.\n\n3:30:36.360 --> 3:30:37.360\n There you go.\n\n3:30:37.360 --> 3:30:39.560\n Well, I think that's kind of like what you were describing.\n\n3:30:39.560 --> 3:30:41.800\n It's like, if I give you an answer, it has to be a good one.\n\n3:30:41.800 --> 3:30:43.720\n Better to just let your imagination run.\n\n3:30:43.720 --> 3:30:44.720\n Exactly.\n\n3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:45.720\n Yeah.\n\n3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:48.720\n He's like the Kubrick of our time.\n\n3:30:48.720 --> 3:30:58.160\n Now what's really interesting that sometimes, period, it's not real, but sometimes I struggle\n\n3:30:58.160 --> 3:31:02.120\n with the fact of why there's a possibility I can really hurt somebody.\n\n3:31:02.120 --> 3:31:06.400\n Like you don't want to hurt them.\n\n3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:10.720\n What do you mean when you struggle with the possibility that you could hurt them?\n\n3:31:10.720 --> 3:31:15.480\n That is sometimes, it's orgasmic sometimes.\n\n3:31:15.480 --> 3:31:17.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:17.120 --> 3:31:23.280\n Like some fights, like particular, like Tyrell Biggs or someone that you had problems with,\n\n3:31:23.280 --> 3:31:26.920\n someone that you, you had animosity towards.\n\n3:31:26.920 --> 3:31:29.680\n So when you finally get your hands on them.\n\n3:31:29.680 --> 3:31:36.360\n Hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you, gets you erect?\n\n3:31:36.360 --> 3:31:37.360\n What does that mean?\n\n3:31:37.360 --> 3:31:40.040\n It's a good question.\n\n3:31:40.040 --> 3:31:41.680\n Means you're getting excited.\n\n3:31:41.680 --> 3:31:42.880\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:45.360\n So that, that's going through your mind right now.\n\n3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:50.300\n Well, that's how I get when I was a kid and I, you know, sometimes I get the twinkle.\n\n3:31:50.300 --> 3:31:51.300\n The twinkle.\n\n3:31:51.300 --> 3:31:52.300\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:52.300 --> 3:31:53.300\n Well, that's what I'm saying.\n\n3:31:53.300 --> 3:31:58.480\n When you reached a state as a human being, as a champion, as a ferocious fighter, you\n\n3:31:58.480 --> 3:32:04.880\n reached a state of, of ability and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever, ever touch\n\n3:32:04.880 --> 3:32:06.380\n and feel.\n\n3:32:06.380 --> 3:32:10.360\n That's why I'm asking you when you're running, when you're hitting the bag, when that heart's\n\n3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:15.080\n beating again and that you know who you are, you're Mike motherfucking Tyson.\n\n3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:17.840\n So when you're doing all this shit again, you're still Mike Tyson.\n\n3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:20.840\n Those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again.\n\n3:32:20.840 --> 3:32:23.480\n It's got to be pretty wild.\n\n3:32:23.480 --> 3:32:26.360\n I don't know.\n\n3:32:26.360 --> 3:32:31.600\n It's wild, but I believe it's rightfully so to be that way.\n\n3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:36.240\n And I used to know how to, I don't say I'm master, but I used to know how to deal with\n\n3:32:36.240 --> 3:32:37.240\n it.\n\n3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:38.240\n I don't let it overwhelm me.\n\n3:32:38.240 --> 3:32:45.320\n I mean, he goes on to try to, they don't ever, like Joe doesn't bite.\n\n3:32:45.320 --> 3:32:51.720\n The interesting thing about that conversation is Mike was trying to figure himself out.\n\n3:32:51.720 --> 3:32:59.720\n Like he's trying on the spot, like, why do I feel this way?\n\n3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:08.560\n To me it was like, to me it's so real and honest to feel like pleasure from hurting\n\n3:33:08.560 --> 3:33:10.220\n somebody.\n\n3:33:10.220 --> 3:33:13.720\n Like that you rarely hear that.\n\n3:33:13.720 --> 3:33:22.720\n In this society, it's like, you rarely like talk about like you feel pleasure from winning.\n\n3:33:22.720 --> 3:33:29.320\n You feel pleasure from like the relief of overcoming like all the stress you had to\n\n3:33:29.320 --> 3:33:31.120\n go through.\n\n3:33:31.120 --> 3:33:37.280\n Pleasure from just like the specifics of the fight, the techniques you use, the maybe\n\n3:33:37.280 --> 3:33:42.400\n overcoming being down a couple of rounds, but like how often do you hear somebody say,\n\n3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:46.760\n I just enjoyed, he's not even saying because I hate the opponent.\n\n3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:51.440\n He's saying like, I enjoyed purely the violence of it.\n\n3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:52.800\n That's crazy.\n\n3:33:52.800 --> 3:33:56.160\n I mean, I don't know, it's honest.\n\n3:33:56.160 --> 3:34:00.120\n It made me ask, like, I wonder how many of us are cognizant of that.\n\n3:34:00.120 --> 3:34:05.560\n Let's say Mike is uncommonly seemingly honest.\n\n3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:09.840\n I think athletes make a full time job out of lying, you know, I think people make a\n\n3:34:09.840 --> 3:34:10.840\n full time job.\n\n3:34:10.840 --> 3:34:11.840\n To themselves perhaps too.\n\n3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:16.280\n I mean, in some, you tell yourself or you tell others what you feel you need to, or\n\n3:34:16.280 --> 3:34:20.320\n maybe whether you've, whether you even know what you feel you need to, but why should\n\n3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:25.600\n he not, I mean, again, did he, did he run up and just hit somebody that's didn't sign\n\n3:34:25.600 --> 3:34:26.600\n up for this?\n\n3:34:26.600 --> 3:34:28.720\n No, they, they signed up to be there.\n\n3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:35.640\n Well, that's the interesting thing about Dyson is there's that weird, uh, like nonstandard\n\n3:34:35.640 --> 3:34:36.640\n behavior.\n\n3:34:36.640 --> 3:34:40.560\n I mean, like your fighting style is not standard.\n\n3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:47.200\n He's nonstandard to another degree of like, uh, who else has that in Jiu Jitsu, uh, uh,\n\n3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:55.000\n Polaris, uh, uh, has this kind of weirdness, like what's, what's in there?\n\n3:34:55.000 --> 3:35:01.200\n Like there's a fear that I think, uh, most opponents would have because it's like, it's\n\n3:35:01.200 --> 3:35:06.440\n no longer about like, it takes you out of the realm of its game.\n\n3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:11.360\n It takes us back to the thing we were talking about, like before is it strips away that\n\n3:35:11.360 --> 3:35:17.680\n like several layers of Ryan Hall, the, the podcast, uh, guest, Ryan Hall, the Jiu Jitsu\n\n3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:22.040\n instructor, Ryan Hall, Jiu Jitsu competitor, it keeps going down to a point where like\n\n3:35:22.040 --> 3:35:27.920\n Ryan Hall, the murderer of all things that get in his way that lies underneath all of\n\n3:35:27.920 --> 3:35:28.920\n it.\n\n3:35:28.920 --> 3:35:33.280\n Seemingly like if we're like in this society, we put all that aside, but it makes you wonder\n\n3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:38.880\n like now as society is being tested in many ways, it makes you wonder like what's underneath\n\n3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:39.880\n there.\n\n3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:41.760\n Well, do we want, do we want the answer to that?\n\n3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:42.760\n Cause I guess it's, what is it?\n\n3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:46.600\n Uh, you seem Paul Fiction, you know, the best character in the movie and in the best scene\n\n3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:49.520\n in the movie is like, if my questions here, if you're, what do you call it?\n\n3:35:49.520 --> 3:35:53.000\n If my answer is scary, you should cease asking scary questions, you know?\n\n3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:57.040\n And I guess, uh, you wonder, I mean, all of us, that's something that I think it's funny\n\n3:35:57.040 --> 3:36:03.480\n we go, that's not okay, I mean, versus maybe not appropriate for situation X, Y, or Z.\n\n3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.640\n But uh, what should make any of us think, I mean, humanity is a different place now.\n\n3:36:07.640 --> 3:36:10.460\n And I mean, I'm not saying anything crazy out there, but humanity is a different place\n\n3:36:10.460 --> 3:36:15.920\n now than we were 5,000 years ago where all of us are descended from people who have killed\n\n3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:20.720\n things with their teeth and fingernails in order to be where we are.\n\n3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:24.320\n And whether it was in, whether it was an animal or it was in conflict with another person,\n\n3:36:24.320 --> 3:36:28.960\n I mean, think about the, the chances of dying by violence now are so, so slim, at least\n\n3:36:28.960 --> 3:36:32.840\n in most countries in most plays, like shockingly small, thankfully.\n\n3:36:32.840 --> 3:36:36.920\n But there was a period of time, like the most period of time where dying by violence was\n\n3:36:36.920 --> 3:36:39.120\n mostly how it went down.\n\n3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:44.520\n And I guess what would be facilitative, what would allow you to win back to Ender's game?\n\n3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:49.800\n You know, what allows you, if you can't do that, you are all, you are forever subject\n\n3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:54.600\n to people who can, and that's, that's a real thing.\n\n3:36:54.600 --> 3:36:58.200\n And you know, we're fortunate to find ourselves in a situation where we don't, where other\n\n3:36:58.200 --> 3:36:59.400\n things matter.\n\n3:36:59.400 --> 3:37:02.840\n But that is a funny thing periodically where people, you'll see people kind of drawn at\n\n3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:06.920\n each other, like in videos or out in the world that clearly neither of them expect this to\n\n3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:07.920\n get serious.\n\n3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:08.920\n Like, I'm just going to yell at you.\n\n3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:09.920\n You're going to yell at me.\n\n3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:11.840\n And it's like this weird LARPing thing where we're both going to go on our own separate\n\n3:37:11.840 --> 3:37:12.840\n way.\n\n3:37:12.840 --> 3:37:15.800\n All it takes is one person to be like, well, I wasn't kidding.\n\n3:37:15.800 --> 3:37:16.800\n And it's like, well, you'll go to jail.\n\n3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:20.040\n And it's like, oh, I know you're going to go to the morgue.\n\n3:37:20.040 --> 3:37:22.560\n And it's, that's, but that can happen like that.\n\n3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:23.560\n Like society.\n\n3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:26.280\n I mean, obviously, anyway, you could jump across the table, stab me in the eye.\n\n3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:29.520\n I mean, I appreciate, I'd hope if you don't, and there will be consequences if you do,\n\n3:37:29.520 --> 3:37:34.080\n but not from, not from me, from, from the rest of society will potentially get you at\n\n3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:38.880\n a certain point, but you can decide to not play by the rules anytime you want.\n\n3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:43.320\n It's fascinating that, yeah, that's, we've created rules based on which we all behave,\n\n3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:49.400\n but underneath there, you know, there, there's things that doesn't, there's motivations and\n\n3:37:49.400 --> 3:37:54.800\n forces that don't play by the rules and still there nature is metal is under the surface.\n\n3:37:54.800 --> 3:37:55.800\n Seriously.\n\n3:37:55.800 --> 3:37:59.200\n And again, I pull out my phone and I'm basically saying like, Hey, I'm going to, you're going\n\n3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:00.200\n to get caught.\n\n3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:01.200\n Yeah.\n\n3:38:01.200 --> 3:38:03.360\n But really I'm further antagonizing you rightly or wrongly.\n\n3:38:03.360 --> 3:38:04.360\n You know what I mean?\n\n3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:05.920\n Like, and that, that's an interesting thing.\n\n3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:10.920\n And I feel like just people need to remember any of us need to remember just for any reason,\n\n3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:15.560\n just that's, that's one step away at all, at all times you ever, I've had people say\n\n3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:17.360\n to me before, like, Oh, I don't feel safe.\n\n3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:18.360\n I'm like, you're not safe.\n\n3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:20.440\n I kill you before you get out of this room.\n\n3:38:20.440 --> 3:38:21.440\n Nothing you do to stop that.\n\n3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:22.440\n Nothing.\n\n3:38:22.440 --> 3:38:23.440\n I mean, but don't worry.\n\n3:38:23.440 --> 3:38:26.240\n You can do the same to me, which means I'm like, Oh, Oh, thank goodness.\n\n3:38:26.240 --> 3:38:29.560\n Can you imagine like how many guns are there are in this country?\n\n3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:33.560\n Like I mean, everywhere, I mean, seriously everywhere, but that's a heartening thought.\n\n3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:34.560\n Not the other way.\n\n3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:37.200\n Cause people usually freak out and go, Oh my God, gun violence, gun violence, gun violence\n\n3:38:37.200 --> 3:38:41.920\n is like really not a serious issue in the United States compared to what it could be.\n\n3:38:41.920 --> 3:38:45.920\n Because it means that, I mean, with the amount of guns and the amount of bullets that are\n\n3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:50.920\n out there that are in circulation, can you imagine if like one in every thousand was\n\n3:38:50.920 --> 3:38:52.240\n used in anger each day?\n\n3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:54.880\n I mean, this would be a terrifying place to live.\n\n3:38:54.880 --> 3:38:55.880\n You couldn't go anywhere.\n\n3:38:55.880 --> 3:38:59.700\n So, I mean, although you could say, Hey, this is more than we'd like or X, Y, Z, it actually\n\n3:38:59.700 --> 3:39:04.240\n means that people are much more reasonable and sane than we're saying then, or then I,\n\n3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:06.320\n then sometimes I might, my might argue.\n\n3:39:06.320 --> 3:39:09.920\n So I guess what I mean is like, Oh man, I walked a seven 11 and I didn't get stabbed.\n\n3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:13.960\n I'm like, Oh, well that's good because not because I protected myself with my karate.\n\n3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:18.200\n It's basically no one decided to run over and stab me because I wasn't protecting myself.\n\n3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:19.760\n It's I, they, they stopped.\n\n3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:23.760\n So I guess we're all fortunate to live in a society that, that like you said, nature\n\n3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:26.280\n being metal doesn't become that big of an issue all the time.\n\n3:39:26.280 --> 3:39:29.620\n But it is funny when you get people in the ring and you go, Hey, let's peel back from\n\n3:39:29.620 --> 3:39:34.080\n Mr. Tyson, many layers of that and say, Hey, now it's okay.\n\n3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:37.480\n And it's cool that, I mean, that's what society is doing.\n\n3:39:37.480 --> 3:39:44.480\n So I've lived in Harvard square for awhile and we add extra layers of what safe means.\n\n3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:51.280\n Like now there's a disc discourse about safe spaces, about like ideas being violence or,\n\n3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:58.220\n or like, uh, you know, like, yeah, but ideas are minor slights against your personality\n\n3:39:58.220 --> 3:39:59.600\n being violence.\n\n3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:05.840\n And that's all like extra layers around the nature is metal thing that, uh, it's cool.\n\n3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:06.840\n That's what progress is.\n\n3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:13.080\n But we can't forget that like underneath it is still, it's still the, the thing that will\n\n3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:17.560\n murder at the, at the drop of, uh, in any, at any moment.\n\n3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:23.160\n If uh, if aroused one, one thing that I find funny though, or ironic maybe about the, uh,\n\n3:40:23.160 --> 3:40:27.480\n the, you know, words of violence, you know, offenses, violence thing is that of course\n\n3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:33.680\n that if that, the belief in that then justifies my violence, like my, and whether it may be\n\n3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:38.160\n in my, maybe not physical violence, but my response to my, my aggressive response to\n\n3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:39.160\n things.\n\n3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:42.840\n And I guess like, which it can be regrets of begets a further aggressive response and\n\n3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:47.920\n like a, you know, kind of a tit for tat sort of situation or, or it goes to like, well,\n\n3:40:47.920 --> 3:40:50.960\n there's 10 of me and there's one of you, so we'll get you and you can't do anything about\n\n3:40:50.960 --> 3:40:51.960\n it.\n\n3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:52.960\n But that's not morality.\n\n3:40:52.960 --> 3:40:55.360\n That's, that's just saying that's might makes right.\n\n3:40:55.360 --> 3:40:58.860\n So I guess again, you can understand why people do it and there are certain, there is a progress\n\n3:40:58.860 --> 3:41:00.320\n aspect to it.\n\n3:41:00.320 --> 3:41:06.120\n But again, I guess without proper examination, I'm effectively with my 10 friends, you know,\n\n3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:10.320\n and, and the force of the law, Mike Tyson and people, but not admitting to myself what\n\n3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:11.320\n I'm doing.\n\n3:41:11.320 --> 3:41:13.920\n And at least Mike Tyson again is honest.\n\n3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:16.320\n Are you, uh, afraid of death?\n\n3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:21.280\n I mean, it's easy for me to say no, as I sit here, probably not about to die, but.\n\n3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:24.200\n Is this like the UFC question, can you defeat any opponent?\n\n3:41:24.200 --> 3:41:26.840\n The answer is of course, yes.\n\n3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:29.680\n And uh, I don't have, they're not around, they're not here, are they?\n\n3:41:29.680 --> 3:41:30.680\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:33.700\n But, uh, I mean, are you, uh, do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n3:41:33.700 --> 3:41:39.040\n Maybe another context to that is you mentioned two deaths for martial artists.\n\n3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:42.800\n I think that's actually why, honestly, even though at a relatively young age, I think\n\n3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:46.360\n mortality is something that I'm aware of more, maybe more than the average person.\n\n3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:50.640\n I think probably most athletes can speak to this and anyone that's had trouble, I've managed\n\n3:41:50.640 --> 3:41:55.440\n to just slide out of a couple of near death experiences personally, you know, mostly river\n\n3:41:55.440 --> 3:42:01.480\n related, um, because I'm an idiot, but, um, I regret nothing, but, uh, yeah, but, uh,\n\n3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:02.480\n thank God we're here.\n\n3:42:02.480 --> 3:42:10.160\n But, um, yeah, it is an interest seeing, seeing the end and seeing going, well, what's going\n\n3:42:10.160 --> 3:42:11.160\n to happen.\n\n3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:14.840\n I guess I think it comes back to kind of what we're discussing about belief structure and\n\n3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:15.980\n belief system.\n\n3:42:15.980 --> 3:42:21.120\n I think a lot of times, if I recognize that no matter what I do, it's all going to end\n\n3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:23.760\n one day and then you go, well, why were we here?\n\n3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:24.760\n What would I do?\n\n3:42:24.760 --> 3:42:26.280\n Am I going to make it to 40?\n\n3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:27.280\n I have no idea.\n\n3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:31.240\n I'd like to hope so that I had no idea that I was going to make it to the age that I am\n\n3:42:31.240 --> 3:42:32.240\n now.\n\n3:42:32.240 --> 3:42:33.720\n Um, am I going to make it to 80?\n\n3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:36.740\n How much of that is in my control?\n\n3:42:36.740 --> 3:42:37.740\n Much of it is not.\n\n3:42:37.740 --> 3:42:38.820\n I mean, it's so funny.\n\n3:42:38.820 --> 3:42:42.140\n It's an interesting, like back to the belief structure again, like locus of internal and\n\n3:42:42.140 --> 3:42:44.000\n external locus of control.\n\n3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:47.600\n You know, what's facilitative versus what's true.\n\n3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:51.760\n And you know, I think accepting personal responsibility for more than is on my control is, is probably\n\n3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:57.800\n a positive, but at the same time, recognizing that much of much is not in my control.\n\n3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:02.440\n I was fortunate enough to be born in the United States, fortunate enough to, you know, to\n\n3:43:02.440 --> 3:43:06.560\n not knock on wood, have, have a serious disease that I'm not aware of right now.\n\n3:43:06.560 --> 3:43:08.280\n Um, I didn't do any of that.\n\n3:43:08.280 --> 3:43:09.880\n I just showed up.\n\n3:43:09.880 --> 3:43:11.400\n That was really fortunate.\n\n3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:17.120\n And I guess that doesn't diminish the fact that I've tried to make decent choices, but\n\n3:43:17.120 --> 3:43:18.560\n it works in concert with it.\n\n3:43:18.560 --> 3:43:24.280\n And I, I guess, um, when I, when you go, is death what I want right now?\n\n3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:26.400\n No, no, I should think not.\n\n3:43:26.400 --> 3:43:30.520\n And again, it's easier for me to be relatively calm about as I'm not staring it in the face,\n\n3:43:30.520 --> 3:43:35.800\n but what I would care a lot more about is, is how you live.\n\n3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:37.320\n That's what's in my control.\n\n3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:41.760\n And I can't control if, as I walk out of this building, a helicopter falls on me worrying\n\n3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:42.760\n about that.\n\n3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:43.760\n I can't control it.\n\n3:43:43.760 --> 3:43:46.600\n Maybe I, maybe I have cancer now and I don't know it and I really hope not.\n\n3:43:46.600 --> 3:43:47.600\n But um,\n\n3:43:47.600 --> 3:43:51.680\n there's something about meditating on the fact that it could end today outside of your\n\n3:43:51.680 --> 3:43:58.560\n control that can clarify your thinking about the, the fact that life is amazing, like just\n\n3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:01.680\n kind of, yeah, helping you enjoy this moment.\n\n3:44:01.680 --> 3:44:05.760\n Even if life was horrible, let's say for instance, it was, it was, you live at one of those times\n\n3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:11.280\n or places and this place is still exists in this world today that life is brutal and metal\n\n3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:14.640\n and whatever all and short and painful.\n\n3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:15.960\n Would you still want it?\n\n3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:20.480\n And again, as I'm sitting here and not, not on fire physically, it's easy to say yes,\n\n3:44:20.480 --> 3:44:25.680\n but I would, I'm confident I still I'll plant my feet and say yes, any of, any life is amazing\n\n3:44:25.680 --> 3:44:31.080\n and beautiful and a gift and unbelievable gift, uh, that none of us have earned for\n\n3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:32.080\n the record.\n\n3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:35.040\n We're, I hate the word earned a lot of times earned yet you earn, but it's like, there's\n\n3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:37.160\n a lot of, a lot of good fortune and earning.\n\n3:44:37.160 --> 3:44:41.160\n And that's back to, do I want justice or do I want grace?\n\n3:44:41.160 --> 3:44:44.360\n And I guess we're all fortunate to be where we are, no matter where we are.\n\n3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:48.360\n And hopefully it should give us some sense of perspective, some sense of compassion for\n\n3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:49.360\n other people.\n\n3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:54.440\n But also like, like you said, a sense of peace, if it all ended right now, would I be happy\n\n3:44:54.440 --> 3:44:56.200\n with what I, with life to this point?\n\n3:44:56.200 --> 3:44:58.680\n I'm like, of course, would you like to live a little longer?\n\n3:44:58.680 --> 3:44:59.680\n Yeah.\n\n3:44:59.680 --> 3:45:03.920\n I would try to do more and try to live rightly to the best that I know how, which over time\n\n3:45:03.920 --> 3:45:07.540\n will hopefully continue to evolve in a, in a positive direction.\n\n3:45:07.540 --> 3:45:14.440\n But if the answer to that is no, I guess, uh, that's, that's always, that's a sign that,\n\n3:45:14.440 --> 3:45:16.400\n that what I'm doing is not what I'm meant to be doing.\n\n3:45:16.400 --> 3:45:21.120\n And I mean, you're familiar with the Tecumseh before, uh, so there's a, I've got one actually,\n\n3:45:21.120 --> 3:45:23.720\n if you could give me 10 seconds, I'll, I'll read this one out.\n\n3:45:23.720 --> 3:45:26.520\n This is a personal favorite basically.\n\n3:45:26.520 --> 3:45:29.940\n And I think it sums up, I mean, again, like it's one of those quotes on the internet,\n\n3:45:29.940 --> 3:45:32.600\n like when Abraham Lincoln said, don't believe everything you read online.\n\n3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:38.140\n Um, but, uh, this is, you know, I, it's again, uh, attributed, but it's like, so live your\n\n3:45:38.140 --> 3:45:42.840\n life that the fear of death can never enter your heart, trouble, no one about their religion,\n\n3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:46.960\n respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours, love your life, perfect\n\n3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:49.800\n your life and beautify all things in your life.\n\n3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:53.480\n Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people.\n\n3:45:53.480 --> 3:45:54.940\n Prepare a noble death song for the day.\n\n3:45:54.940 --> 3:45:58.980\n When you go over the great divide, always give a word or sign of salute when meeting\n\n3:45:58.980 --> 3:46:03.080\n or passing a friend, even a stranger when in a lonely place.\n\n3:46:03.080 --> 3:46:06.200\n Show respect to all people and grovel to none.\n\n3:46:06.200 --> 3:46:10.060\n When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and for the joy of living.\n\n3:46:10.060 --> 3:46:13.940\n If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.\n\n3:46:13.940 --> 3:46:17.680\n Abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit\n\n3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:19.280\n of its vision.\n\n3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:22.440\n When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear\n\n3:46:22.440 --> 3:46:26.200\n of death so that when their time comes, they weep and pray for a little more time to live\n\n3:46:26.200 --> 3:46:28.960\n their lives over again in a different way.\n\n3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:32.200\n Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.\n\n3:46:32.200 --> 3:46:33.200\n Powerful words.\n\n3:46:33.200 --> 3:46:35.280\n I don't think there's a better way to end it.\n\n3:46:35.280 --> 3:46:40.160\n Let me just say, we've spoke maybe five, six years ago.\n\n3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:46.180\n I don't even remember when, but I'm not exaggerating saying like you had a huge impact on my life\n\n3:46:46.180 --> 3:46:47.640\n because of the podcast.\n\n3:46:47.640 --> 3:46:52.200\n You're the reason I was doing the podcast as long as I have.\n\n3:46:52.200 --> 3:46:55.560\n You're the reason I'm doing this podcast.\n\n3:46:55.560 --> 3:46:59.160\n It's a little, it's a stupid little meeting that you probably didn't know who I was.\n\n3:46:59.160 --> 3:47:00.880\n I didn't really know who you are.\n\n3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:02.360\n It was just like a magical moment.\n\n3:47:02.360 --> 3:47:05.800\n It's a flap of a butterfly wing kind of situation.\n\n3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:07.760\n And yeah, I'm forever grateful.\n\n3:47:07.760 --> 3:47:11.120\n You're one of the most inspiring people in my life.\n\n3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:15.200\n So Ryan, it's a huge honor that you would come here.\n\n3:47:15.200 --> 3:47:18.520\n Jen didn't talk with me and waste all this time.\n\n3:47:18.520 --> 3:47:19.520\n I really appreciate it.\n\n3:47:19.520 --> 3:47:20.580\n It was amazing.\n\n3:47:20.580 --> 3:47:21.580\n Thank you so much, Alexis.\n\n3:47:21.580 --> 3:47:22.580\n It's just been a pleasure.\n\n3:47:22.580 --> 3:47:23.580\n I really appreciate you having us on.\n\n3:47:23.580 --> 3:47:24.580\n Thank you.\n\n3:47:24.580 --> 3:47:28.000\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ryan Hall.\n\n3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:32.540\n And thank you to our

pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense.\n\n3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:01.880\n But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.\n\n3:48:01.880 --> 3:48:23.000\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
