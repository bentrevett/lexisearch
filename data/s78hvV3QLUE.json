00:07.640\n at Stanford University and founding director\n\n00:07.640 --> 00:10.400\n of Stanford Institute of Theoretical Physics.\n\n00:10.400 --> 00:13.040\n He is widely regarded as one of the fathers\n\n00:13.040 --> 00:14.920\n of string theory and in general,\n\n00:14.920 --> 00:17.400\n as one of the greatest physicists of our time,\n\n00:17.400 --> 00:20.400\n both as a researcher and an educator.\n\n00:20.400 --> 00:23.320\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:23.320 --> 00:26.120\n Perhaps you noticed that the people I've been speaking with\n\n00:26.120 --> 00:27.880\n are not just computer scientists,\n\n00:27.880 --> 00:30.640\n but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,\n\n00:30.640 --> 00:34.240\n psychologists, physicists, and soon other disciplines.\n\n00:34.240 --> 00:37.400\n To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,\n\n00:37.400 --> 00:39.000\n bigger than computing.\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:40.880\n It is our civilization's journey\n\n00:40.880 --> 00:42.880\n into understanding the human mind\n\n00:42.880 --> 00:45.880\n and creating echoes of it in the machine.\n\n00:45.880 --> 00:48.800\n If you enjoy the podcast,

at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A M.\n\n00:57.600 --> 01:01.640\n And now, here's my conversation with Leonard Susskind.\n\n01:02.760 --> 01:05.360\n You worked and were friends with Richard Feynman.\n\n01:05.360 --> 01:07.640\n How has he influenced you, changed you\n\n01:07.640 --> 01:09.120\n as a physicist and thinker?\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:13.920\n What I saw, I think what I saw was somebody\n\n01:13.920 --> 01:18.600\n who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way.\n\n01:18.600 --> 01:21.080\n His style was almost to close his eyes\n\n01:21.080 --> 01:24.540\n and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about.\n\n01:24.540 --> 01:29.540\n And through visualization, outflank the mathematical,\n\n01:30.520 --> 01:34.360\n the highly mathematical and very, very sophisticated\n\n01:34.360 --> 01:37.020\n technical arguments that people would use.\n\n01:37.020 --> 01:39.400\n I think that was also natural to me,\n\n01:39.400 --> 01:43.960\n but I saw somebody who was actually successful at it,\n\n01:43.960 --> 01:47.760\n who could do physics in a way that I regarded\n\n01:47.760 --> 01:54.760\n as simpler, more direct, more intuitive.\n\n01:55.520 --> 01:59.080\n And while I don't think he changed my way of thinking,\n\n01:59.080 --> 02:01.480\n I do think he validated it.\n\n02:01.480 --> 02:03.080\n He made me look at it and say, yeah,\n\n02:03.080 --> 02:06.280\n that's something you can do and get away with.\n\n02:06.280 --> 02:08.680\n Practically didn't get away with it.\n\n02:08.680 --> 02:12.000\n So do you find yourself, whether you're thinking\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.720\n about quantum mechanics or black holes\n\n02:14.720 --> 02:19.400\n or string theory, using intuition as a first step\n\n02:19.400 --> 02:22.160\n or step throughout using visualization?\n\n02:22.160 --> 02:24.680\n Yeah, very much so, very much so.\n\n02:24.680 --> 02:27.720\n I tend not to think about the equations.\n\n02:27.720 --> 02:30.160\n I tend not to think about the symbols.\n\n02:30.160 --> 02:34.660\n I tend to try to visualize the phenomena themselves.\n\n02:34.660 --> 02:38.400\n And then when I get an insight that I think is valid,\n\n02:38.400 --> 02:40.360\n I might try to convert it to mathematics,\n\n02:40.360 --> 02:44.400\n but I'm not a natural mathematician.\n\n02:44.400 --> 02:46.280\n I'm good enough at it.\n\n02:46.280 --> 02:49.820\n I'm good enough at it, but I'm not a great mathematician.\n\n02:49.820 --> 02:52.440\n So for me, the way of thinking about physics\n\n02:52.440 --> 02:56.660\n is first intuitive, first visualization,\n\n02:57.760 --> 02:59.680\n scribble a few equations maybe,\n\n02:59.680 --> 03:02.980\n but then try to convert it to mathematics.\n\n03:02.980 --> 03:04.800\n Experience is that other people are better\n\n03:04.800 --> 03:06.880\n at converting it to mathematics than I am.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:12.000\n And yet you've worked with very counterintuitive ideas.\n\n03:12.000 --> 03:12.840\n No, that's true.\n\n03:12.840 --> 03:13.680\n That's true.\n\n03:13.680 --> 03:15.600\n You can visualize something counterintuitive.\n\n03:15.600 --> 03:16.440\n How do you dare?\n\n03:16.440 --> 03:18.900\n By rewiring your brain in new ways.\n\n03:19.920 --> 03:22.680\n Yeah, quantum mechanics is not intuitive.\n\n03:22.680 --> 03:25.740\n Very little of modern physics is intuitive.\n\n03:26.840 --> 03:29.480\n Intuitive, what does intuitive mean?\n\n03:29.480 --> 03:31.800\n It means the ability to think about it\n\n03:31.800 --> 03:33.720\n with basic classical physics,\n\n03:33.720 --> 03:38.720\n the physics that we evolved with throwing stones,\n\n03:38.720 --> 03:43.360\n or splashing water, whatever it happens to be.\n\n03:44.800 --> 03:47.080\n Quantum physics, general relativity,\n\n03:47.080 --> 03:51.160\n quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way.\n\n03:51.160 --> 03:55.200\n But after time and getting familiar with these things,\n\n03:55.200 --> 03:57.040\n you develop new intuitions.\n\n03:57.040 --> 03:58.520\n I always said you rewire.\n\n03:59.680 --> 04:04.360\n And it's to the point where me and many of my friends,\n\n04:04.360 --> 04:05.680\n I and many of my friends,\n\n04:05.680 --> 04:10.280\n can think more easily quantum mechanically\n\n04:10.280 --> 04:11.520\n than we can classically.\n\n04:11.520 --> 04:13.520\n We've gotten so used to it.\n\n04:13.520 --> 04:17.240\n I mean, yes, our neural wiring in our brain\n\n04:17.240 --> 04:20.400\n is such that we understand rocks and stones and water\n\n04:20.400 --> 04:21.240\n and so on.\n\n04:21.240 --> 04:22.060\n We sort of evolved for that.\n\n04:22.060 --> 04:23.320\n Evolved for it.\n\n04:23.320 --> 04:26.720\n Do you think it's possible to create a wiring\n\n04:26.720 --> 04:31.160\n of neuron like state devices that more naturally\n\n04:31.160 --> 04:35.880\n understand quantum mechanics, understand wave function,\n\n04:35.880 --> 04:38.120\n understand these weird things?\n\n04:38.120 --> 04:39.040\n Well, I'm not sure.\n\n04:39.040 --> 04:42.480\n I think many of us have evolved the ability\n\n04:42.480 --> 04:46.360\n to think quantum mechanically to some extent.\n\n04:46.360 --> 04:48.960\n But that doesn't mean you can think like an electron.\n\n04:50.220 --> 04:53.600\n That doesn't mean another example.\n\n04:53.600 --> 04:55.880\n Forget for a minute quantum mechanics.\n\n04:55.880 --> 04:58.660\n Just visualizing four dimensional space\n\n04:58.660 --> 05:02.080\n or five dimensional space or six dimensional space,\n\n05:02.080 --> 05:05.780\n I think we're fundamentally wired\n\n05:05.780 --> 05:08.240\n to visualize three dimensions.\n\n05:08.240 --> 05:11.960\n I can't even visualize two dimensions or one dimension\n\n05:11.960 --> 05:16.040\n without thinking about it as embedded in three dimensions.\n\n05:16.040 --> 05:18.280\n If I wanna visualize a line,\n\n05:18.280 --> 05:21.820\n I think of the line as being a line in three dimensions.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:25.580\n Or I think of the line as being a line on a piece of paper\n\n05:25.580 --> 05:28.160\n with a piece of paper being in three dimensions.\n\n05:28.160 --> 05:33.160\n I never seem to be able to, in some abstract and pure way,\n\n05:33.240 --> 05:35.920\n visualize in my head the one dimension,\n\n05:35.920 --> 05:38.840\n the two dimension, the four dimension, the five dimensions.\n\n05:38.840 --> 05:41.400\n And I don't think that's ever gonna happen.\n\n05:41.400 --> 05:43.600\n The reason is I think our neural wiring\n\n05:43.600 --> 05:44.920\n is just set up for that.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.060\n On the other hand, we do learn ways\n\n05:49.060 --> 05:52.600\n to think about five, six, seven dimensions.\n\n05:52.600 --> 05:56.200\n We learn ways, we learn mathematical ways,\n\n05:56.200 --> 05:59.640\n and we learn ways to visualize them, but they're different.\n\n06:00.800 --> 06:04.800\n And so yeah, I think we do rewire ourselves.\n\n06:04.800 --> 06:07.240\n Whether we can ever completely rewire ourselves\n\n06:07.240 --> 06:11.680\n to be completely comfortable with these concepts, I doubt.\n\n06:11.680 --> 06:13.560\n So that it's completely natural.\n\n06:13.560 --> 06:15.080\n To where it's completely natural.\n\n06:15.080 --> 06:18.160\n So I'm sure there's somewhat, you could argue,\n\n06:18.160 --> 06:22.400\n creatures that live in a two dimensional space.\n\n06:22.400 --> 06:23.560\n Yeah, maybe there are.\n\n06:23.560 --> 06:28.560\n And while it's romanticizing the notion of curse,\n\n06:28.640 --> 06:30.040\n we're all living, as far as we know,\n\n06:30.040 --> 06:31.680\n in three dimensional space.\n\n06:31.680 --> 06:35.600\n But how do those creatures imagine 3D space?\n\n06:35.600 --> 06:37.640\n Well, probably the way we imagine 4D,\n\n06:37.640 --> 06:40.480\n by using some mathematics and some equations\n\n06:40.480 --> 06:43.060\n and some tricks.\n\n06:44.440 --> 06:48.380\n Okay, so jumping back to Feynman just for a second.\n\n06:48.380 --> 06:52.700\n He had a little bit of an ego.\n\n06:52.700 --> 06:54.780\n Yes.\n\n06:54.780 --> 06:59.140\n Why, do you think ego is powerful or dangerous in science?\n\n07:00.140 --> 07:02.880\n I think both, both, both.\n\n07:02.880 --> 07:06.500\n I think you have to have both arrogance and humility.\n\n07:06.500 --> 07:10.620\n You have to have the arrogance to say, I can do this.\n\n07:10.620 --> 07:13.620\n Nature is difficult, nature is very, very hard.\n\n07:13.620 --> 07:16.140\n I'm smart enough, I can do it.\n\n07:16.140 --> 07:19.020\n I can win the battle with nature.\n\n07:19.020 --> 07:21.020\n On the other hand, I think you also have to have\n\n07:21.020 --> 07:26.020\n the humility to know that you're very likely\n\n07:26.460 --> 07:29.060\n to be wrong on any given occasion.\n\n07:29.060 --> 07:32.060\n Everything you're thinking could suddenly change.\n\n07:33.300 --> 07:35.500\n Young people can come along and say things\n\n07:35.500 --> 07:38.920\n you won't understand and you'll be lost and flabbergasted.\n\n07:39.820 --> 07:42.620\n So I think it's a combination of both.\n\n07:42.620 --> 07:46.660\n You better recognize that you're very limited,\n\n07:46.660 --> 07:49.280\n and you better be able to say to yourself,\n\n07:49.280 --> 07:52.500\n I'm not so limited that I can't win this battle with nature.\n\n07:53.460 --> 07:56.640\n It takes a special kind of person\n\n07:56.640 --> 07:59.820\n who can manage both of those, I would say.\n\n07:59.820 --> 08:03.020\n And I would say there's echoes of that in your own work,\n\n08:03.020 --> 08:05.900\n a little bit of ego, a little bit of outside of the box,\n\n08:05.900 --> 08:06.860\n humble thinking.\n\n08:08.260 --> 08:09.580\n I hope so.\n\n08:09.580 --> 08:14.580\n So was there a time where you felt,\n\n08:16.500 --> 08:18.080\n you looked at yourself and asked,\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:19.920\n am I completely wrong about this?\n\n08:19.920 --> 08:23.980\n Oh yeah, about the whole thing or about specific things?\n\n08:23.980 --> 08:24.900\n The whole thing.\n\n08:24.900 --> 08:25.900\n What do you mean?\n\n08:25.900 --> 08:27.060\n Wait, which whole thing?\n\n08:27.060 --> 08:29.960\n Me and me and my ability to do this thing.\n\n08:29.960 --> 08:31.420\n Oh, those kinds of doubts.\n\n08:31.420 --> 08:33.840\n First of all, did you have those kinds of doubts?\n\n08:33.840 --> 08:35.940\n No, I had different kind of doubts.\n\n08:35.940 --> 08:37.940\n I came from a very working class background\n\n08:37.940 --> 08:41.100\n and I was uncomfortable in academia for,\n\n08:41.100 --> 08:42.680\n oh, for a long time.\n\n08:43.760 --> 08:46.260\n But they weren't doubts about my ability or my,\n\n08:48.020 --> 08:52.740\n they were just the discomfort in being in an environment\n\n08:52.740 --> 08:56.620\n that my family hadn't participated in,\n\n08:56.620 --> 08:58.320\n I knew nothing about as a young person.\n\n08:58.320 --> 09:00.700\n I didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics\n\n09:00.700 --> 09:02.340\n until I was almost 20 years old.\n\n09:02.340 --> 09:07.340\n Yeah, so I did have certain kind of doubts,\n\n09:09.560 --> 09:11.860\n but not about my ability.\n\n09:11.860 --> 09:14.000\n I don't think I was too worried\n\n09:14.000 --> 09:15.900\n about whether I would succeed or not.\n\n09:18.040 --> 09:21.860\n I never felt this insecurity, am I ever gonna get a job?\n\n09:23.080 --> 09:25.720\n That had never occurred to me that I wouldn't.\n\n09:27.180 --> 09:29.860\n Maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense\n\n09:29.860 --> 09:31.720\n of what is academia.\n\n09:31.720 --> 09:35.100\n Because I too feel a bit uncomfortable in it.\n\n09:37.800 --> 09:40.040\n There's something I can't put quite into words\n\n09:40.040 --> 09:45.040\n what you have that's not, doesn't, if we call it music,\n\n09:45.240 --> 09:48.520\n you play a different kind of music than a lot of academia.\n\n09:48.520 --> 09:51.960\n How have you joined this orchestra?\n\n09:51.960 --> 09:54.480\n How do you think about it?\n\n09:54.480 --> 09:56.080\n I don't know that I thought about it\n\n09:56.080 --> 09:58.240\n as much as I just felt it.\n\n09:58.240 --> 10:02.800\n Thinking is one thing, feeling is another thing.\n\n10:02.800 --> 10:07.100\n I felt like an outsider until a certain age\n\n10:07.100 --> 10:10.740\n when I suddenly found myself the ultimate insider\n\n10:10.740 --> 10:12.080\n in academic physics.\n\n10:14.520 --> 10:19.520\n And that was a sharp transition, and I wasn't a young man.\n\n10:19.600 --> 10:22.280\n I was probably 50 years old.\n\n10:22.280 --> 10:24.960\n So you were never quite, it was a phase transition,\n\n10:24.960 --> 10:27.360\n you were never quite in the middle.\n\n10:27.360 --> 10:29.440\n Yeah, that's right, I wasn't.\n\n10:29.440 --> 10:32.080\n I always felt a little bit of an outsider.\n\n10:32.080 --> 10:34.280\n In the beginning, a lot an outsider.\n\n10:37.200 --> 10:40.440\n My way of thinking was different,\n\n10:40.440 --> 10:43.040\n my approach to mathematics was different,\n\n10:43.040 --> 10:47.160\n but also my social background\n\n10:47.160 --> 10:49.320\n that I came from was different.\n\n10:49.320 --> 10:51.520\n Now these days, half the young people I meet,\n\n10:51.520 --> 10:53.020\n they're parents or professors.\n\n10:53.020 --> 10:55.860\n That was not my case.\n\n10:59.900 --> 11:02.220\n But then all of a sudden, at some point,\n\n11:02.220 --> 11:06.260\n I found myself at very much the center of,\n\n11:06.260 --> 11:07.840\n maybe not the only one at the center,\n\n11:07.840 --> 11:09.860\n but certainly one of the people in the center\n\n11:09.860 --> 11:11.360\n of a certain kind of physics.\n\n11:12.220 --> 11:16.120\n And all that went away, it went away in a flash.\n\n11:17.700 --> 11:21.780\n So maybe a little bit with Feynman,\n\n11:21.780 --> 11:24.500\n but in general, how do you develop ideas?\n\n11:24.500 --> 11:26.100\n Do you work through ideas alone?\n\n11:26.100 --> 11:27.820\n Do you brainstorm with others?\n\n11:27.820 --> 11:30.360\n Oh, both, both, very definitely both.\n\n11:31.400 --> 11:35.580\n The younger time, I spent more time with myself.\n\n11:36.580 --> 11:39.460\n Now, because I'm at Stanford,\n\n11:39.460 --> 11:44.460\n because I have a lot of ex students\n\n11:44.460 --> 11:49.460\n and people who are interested in the same thing I am,\n\n11:50.840 --> 11:54.320\n I spend a good deal of time, almost on a daily basis,\n\n11:54.320 --> 11:57.360\n interacting, brainstorming, as you said.\n\n11:57.360 --> 11:59.400\n It's a very important part.\n\n12:00.400 --> 12:03.720\n I spend less time probably completely self focused\n\n12:03.720 --> 12:07.800\n than with a piece of paper\n\n12:07.800 --> 12:09.640\n and just sitting there staring at it.\n\n12:09.640 --> 12:13.320\n What are your hopes for quantum computers?\n\n12:13.320 --> 12:16.240\n So machines that are based on,\n\n12:16.240 --> 12:21.240\n that have some elements of leverage quantum mechanical ideas.\n\n12:21.240 --> 12:23.840\n Yeah, it's not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas.\n\n12:24.840 --> 12:29.840\n You can simulate quantum systems on a classical computer.\n\n12:29.840 --> 12:33.200\n Simulate them means solve the Schrodinger equation for them\n\n12:33.200 --> 12:36.640\n or solve the equations of quantum mechanics\n\n12:36.640 --> 12:40.200\n or solve the equations of quantum mechanics\n\n12:40.200 --> 12:43.600\n on a computer, on a classical computer.\n\n12:43.600 --> 12:47.400\n But the classical computer is not doing,\n\n12:47.400 --> 12:49.760\n is not a quantum mechanical system itself.\n\n12:49.760 --> 12:50.640\n Of course it is.\n\n12:50.640 --> 12:52.120\n Everything's made of quantum mechanics,\n\n12:52.120 --> 12:53.280\n but it's not functioning.\n\n12:53.280 --> 12:56.080\n It's not functioning as a quantum system.\n\n12:56.080 --> 12:58.560\n It's just solving equations.\n\n12:58.560 --> 13:01.840\n The quantum computer is truly a quantum system\n\n13:01.840 --> 13:05.000\n which is actually doing the things\n\n13:05.000 --> 13:07.360\n that you're programming it to do.\n\n13:07.360 --> 13:11.200\n You want to program a quantum field theory.\n\n13:12.040 --> 13:13.680\n If you do it in classical physics,\n\n13:13.680 --> 13:17.600\n that program is not actually functioning in the computer\n\n13:17.600 --> 13:18.760\n as a quantum field theory.\n\n13:18.760 --> 13:20.460\n It's just solving some equations.\n\n13:21.760 --> 13:23.720\n Physically, it's not doing the things\n\n13:23.720 --> 13:27.240\n that the quantum system would do.\n\n13:27.240 --> 13:30.400\n The quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system\n\n13:30.400 --> 13:34.120\n which is actually carrying out the quantum operations.\n\n13:34.120 --> 13:36.320\n You can measure it at the end.\n\n13:36.320 --> 13:40.480\n It intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle.\n\n13:40.480 --> 13:44.320\n It is limited in the same way that quantum systems\n\n13:44.320 --> 13:47.440\n are limited by uncertainty and so forth.\n\n13:47.440 --> 13:49.240\n And it really is a quantum system.\n\n13:49.240 --> 13:51.360\n That means that what you're doing\n\n13:51.360 --> 13:53.360\n when you program something for a quantum system\n\n13:53.360 --> 13:56.900\n is you're actually building a real version of the system.\n\n13:58.160 --> 14:00.440\n The limits of a classical computer,\n\n14:00.440 --> 14:02.920\n classical computers are enormously limited\n\n14:02.920 --> 14:07.160\n when it comes to the quantum systems.\n\n14:07.160 --> 14:09.040\n They're enormously limited\n\n14:09.040 --> 14:12.240\n because you've probably heard this before,\n\n14:12.240 --> 14:14.960\n but in order to store the amount of information\n\n14:14.960 --> 14:19.920\n that's in a quantum state of 400 spins,\n\n14:19.920 --> 14:23.040\n that's not very many, 400 I can put in my pocket,\n\n14:23.040 --> 14:25.560\n I can put 400 pennies in my pocket.\n\n14:27.840 --> 14:32.160\n To be able to simulate the quantum state\n\n14:32.160 --> 14:37.160\n of 400 elementary quantum systems, qubits we call them,\n\n14:37.640 --> 14:39.880\n to do that would take more information\n\n14:39.880 --> 14:43.120\n than can possibly be stored in the entire universe\n\n14:43.120 --> 14:46.560\n if it were packed so tightly\n\n14:46.560 --> 14:50.380\n that you couldn't pack any more in.\n\n14:50.380 --> 14:52.240\n 400 qubits.\n\n14:52.240 --> 14:54.520\n On the other hand, if your quantum computer\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:56.320\n is composed of 400 qubits,\n\n14:56.320 --> 14:59.420\n it can do everything 400 qubits can do.\n\n14:59.420 --> 15:02.280\n What kind of space, if you just intuitively think\n\n15:02.280 --> 15:06.320\n about the space of algorithms that that unlocks for us,\n\n15:06.320 --> 15:08.480\n so there's a whole complexity theory\n\n15:08.480 --> 15:10.080\n around classical computers,\n\n15:10.080 --> 15:12.440\n measuring the running time of things,\n\n15:12.440 --> 15:14.880\n and P, so on, what kind of algorithms\n\n15:14.880 --> 15:18.360\n just intuitively do you think it unlocks for us?\n\n15:18.360 --> 15:22.080\n Okay, so we know that there are a handful of algorithms\n\n15:22.080 --> 15:25.760\n that can seriously beat classical computers\n\n15:25.760 --> 15:28.200\n and which can have exponentially more power.\n\n15:28.200 --> 15:29.480\n This is a mathematical statement.\n\n15:29.480 --> 15:32.320\n Nobody's exhibited this in the laboratory.\n\n15:32.320 --> 15:33.600\n It's a mathematical statement.\n\n15:33.600 --> 15:37.640\n We know that's true, but it also seems more and more\n\n15:37.640 --> 15:40.320\n that the number of such things is very limited.\n\n15:40.320 --> 15:45.080\n Only very, very special problems\n\n15:45.080 --> 15:48.760\n exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer,\n\n15:49.600 --> 15:52.120\n of standard problems.\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:53.900\n To my mind, as far as I can tell,\n\n15:53.900 --> 15:55.600\n the great power of quantum computers\n\n15:55.600 --> 15:58.700\n will actually be to simulate quantum systems.\n\n15:59.880 --> 16:02.760\n If you're interested in a certain quantum system\n\n16:02.760 --> 16:05.880\n and it's too hard to simulate classically,\n\n16:07.360 --> 16:09.840\n you simply build a version of the same system.\n\n16:09.840 --> 16:11.100\n You build a version of it.\n\n16:11.100 --> 16:12.040\n You build a model of it\n\n16:12.040 --> 16:14.440\n that's actually functioning as the system.\n\n16:14.440 --> 16:16.880\n You run it, and then you do the same thing\n\n16:16.880 --> 16:18.500\n you would do to the quantum system.\n\n16:18.500 --> 16:21.820\n You make measurements on it, quantum measurements on it.\n\n16:21.820 --> 16:26.140\n The advantage is you can run it much slower.\n\n16:26.140 --> 16:27.540\n You could say, why bother?\n\n16:27.540 --> 16:29.580\n Why not just use the real system?\n\n16:29.580 --> 16:32.340\n Why not just do experiments on the real system?\n\n16:32.340 --> 16:33.900\n Well, real systems are kind of limited.\n\n16:33.900 --> 16:34.780\n You can't change them.\n\n16:34.780 --> 16:36.300\n You can't manipulate them.\n\n16:36.300 --> 16:39.380\n You can't slow them down so that you can poke into them.\n\n16:40.420 --> 16:43.420\n You can't modify them in arbitrary kinds of ways\n\n16:43.420 --> 16:48.420\n to see what would happen if I change the system a little bit.\n\n16:48.420 --> 16:53.420\n I think that quantum computers will be extremely valuable\n\n16:55.500 --> 17:00.500\n in understanding quantum systems.\n\n17:00.940 --> 17:04.340\n At the lowest level of the fundamental laws.\n\n17:04.340 --> 17:06.540\n They're actually satisfying the same laws\n\n17:06.540 --> 17:09.860\n as the systems that they're simulating.\n\n17:09.860 --> 17:13.060\n Okay, so on the one hand, you have things like factoring.\n\n17:13.060 --> 17:17.580\n Factoring is the great thing of quantum computers.\n\n17:17.580 --> 17:20.620\n Factoring large numbers, that doesn't seem that much\n\n17:20.620 --> 17:22.580\n to do with quantum mechanics.\n\n17:22.580 --> 17:27.580\n It seems to be almost a fluke that a quantum computer\n\n17:28.540 --> 17:32.920\n can solve the factoring problem in a short time.\n\n17:34.420 --> 17:38.520\n And those problems seem to be extremely special, rare,\n\n17:38.520 --> 17:40.300\n and it's not clear to me\n\n17:40.300 --> 17:42.740\n that there's gonna be a lot of them.\n\n17:42.740 --> 17:45.180\n On the other hand, there are a lot of quantum systems.\n\n17:45.180 --> 17:47.900\n Chemistry, there's solid state physics,\n\n17:47.900 --> 17:51.020\n there's material science, there's quantum gravity,\n\n17:51.020 --> 17:53.660\n there's all kinds of quantum field theory.\n\n17:54.540 --> 17:56.780\n And some of these are actually turning out\n\n17:56.780 --> 17:58.100\n to be applied sciences,\n\n17:58.100 --> 18:00.140\n as well as very fundamental sciences.\n\n18:01.120 --> 18:05.140\n So we probably will run out of the ability\n\n18:05.140 --> 18:07.960\n to solve equations for these things.\n\n18:07.960 --> 18:11.620\n Solve equations by the standard methods of pencil and paper.\n\n18:11.620 --> 18:15.440\n Solve the equations by the method of classical computers.\n\n18:16.380 --> 18:18.740\n And so what we'll do is we'll build versions\n\n18:18.740 --> 18:22.120\n of these systems, run them,\n\n18:22.120 --> 18:24.280\n and run them under controlled circumstances\n\n18:24.280 --> 18:26.840\n where we can change them, manipulate them,\n\n18:26.840 --> 18:28.100\n make measurements on them,\n\n18:28.100 --> 18:30.540\n and find out all the things we wanna know.\n\n18:30.540 --> 18:33.640\n So in finding out the things we wanna know\n\n18:33.640 --> 18:38.640\n about very small systems, is there something\n\n18:38.640 --> 18:42.080\n that we can also find out about the macro level,\n\n18:42.080 --> 18:45.040\n about something about the function, forgive me,\n\n18:45.040 --> 18:48.080\n of our brain, biological systems,\n\n18:48.080 --> 18:50.380\n the stuff that's about one meter in size\n\n18:50.380 --> 18:53.260\n versus much, much smaller?\n\n18:53.260 --> 18:55.200\n Well, what all the excitement is about\n\n18:55.200 --> 18:56.880\n among the people that I interact with\n\n18:56.880 --> 18:58.960\n is understanding black holes.\n\n18:58.960 --> 18:59.800\n Black holes.\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:01.040\n Black holes are big things.\n\n19:02.160 --> 19:04.100\n They are many, many degrees of freedom.\n\n19:04.100 --> 19:08.740\n There is another kind of quantum system that is big.\n\n19:08.740 --> 19:10.860\n It's a large quantum computer.\n\n19:11.760 --> 19:13.140\n And one of the things we've learned\n\n19:13.140 --> 19:15.700\n is that the physics of large quantum computers\n\n19:15.700 --> 19:17.580\n is in some ways similar to the physics\n\n19:17.580 --> 19:19.740\n of large quantum black holes.\n\n19:19.740 --> 19:22.000\n And we're using that relationship.\n\n19:22.000 --> 19:24.780\n Now you asked, you didn't ask about quantum computers\n\n19:24.780 --> 19:28.100\n or systems, you didn't ask about black holes,\n\n19:28.100 --> 19:29.940\n you asked about brains.\n\n19:29.940 --> 19:32.300\n Yeah, about stuff that's in the middle of the two.\n\n19:32.300 --> 19:34.060\n It's different.\n\n19:34.060 --> 19:36.580\n So black holes are,\n\n19:36.580 --> 19:39.580\n there's something fundamental about black holes\n\n19:39.580 --> 19:42.180\n that feels to be very different than a brain.\n\n19:42.180 --> 19:43.300\n Yes.\n\n19:43.300 --> 19:45.980\n And they also function in a very quantum mechanical way.\n\n19:45.980 --> 19:46.820\n Right.\n\n19:46.820 --> 19:47.820\n Okay.\n\n19:47.820 --> 19:50.620\n It is, first of all, unclear to me,\n\n19:50.620 --> 19:52.140\n but of course it's unclear to me.\n\n19:52.140 --> 19:54.480\n I'm not a neuroscientist.\n\n19:55.340 --> 19:58.100\n I have, I don't even have very many friends\n\n19:58.100 --> 20:00.200\n who are neuroscientists.\n\n20:00.200 --> 20:02.580\n I would like to have more friends who are neuroscientists.\n\n20:02.580 --> 20:04.460\n I just don't run into them very often.\n\n20:05.620 --> 20:07.420\n Among the few neuroscientists\n\n20:07.420 --> 20:09.640\n I've ever talked about about this,\n\n20:09.640 --> 20:12.440\n they are pretty convinced\n\n20:12.440 --> 20:15.720\n that the brain functions classically,\n\n20:16.740 --> 20:20.600\n that it is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system\n\n20:20.600 --> 20:23.640\n or it doesn't make use of the special features,\n\n20:23.640 --> 20:26.460\n entanglement, coherence, superposition.\n\n20:26.460 --> 20:27.380\n Are they right?\n\n20:27.380 --> 20:28.960\n I don't know.\n\n20:28.960 --> 20:30.340\n I sort of hope they're wrong\n\n20:30.340 --> 20:32.900\n just because I like the romantic idea\n\n20:32.900 --> 20:35.180\n that the brain is a quantum system.\n\n20:35.180 --> 20:37.820\n But I think probably not.\n\n20:38.680 --> 20:40.100\n The other thing,\n\n20:40.100 --> 20:43.020\n big systems can be composed of lots of little systems.\n\n20:44.180 --> 20:47.700\n Materials, the materials that we work with and so forth\n\n20:47.700 --> 20:52.700\n are, can be large systems, a large piece of material,\n\n20:52.880 --> 20:55.140\n but they're made out of quantum systems.\n\n20:55.140 --> 20:57.180\n Now, one of the things that's been happening\n\n20:57.180 --> 21:00.580\n over the last good number of years\n\n21:00.580 --> 21:04.720\n is we're discovering materials and quantum systems,\n\n21:04.720 --> 21:08.220\n which function much more quantum mechanically\n\n21:08.220 --> 21:09.640\n than we imagined.\n\n21:09.640 --> 21:12.020\n Topological insulators, this kind of thing,\n\n21:12.020 --> 21:13.500\n that kind of thing.\n\n21:13.500 --> 21:15.220\n Those are macroscopic systems,\n\n21:15.220 --> 21:17.860\n but they're just superconductors.\n\n21:17.860 --> 21:21.880\n Superconductors have a lot of quantum mechanics in them.\n\n21:22.900 --> 21:25.040\n You can have a large chunk of superconductor.\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:26.780\n So it's a big piece of material.\n\n21:26.780 --> 21:29.640\n On the other hand, it's functioning and its properties\n\n21:29.640 --> 21:32.840\n depend very, very strongly on quantum mechanics.\n\n21:32.840 --> 21:36.200\n And to analyze them, you need the tools of quantum mechanics.\n\n21:37.380 --> 21:39.540\n If we can go on to black holes\n\n21:41.100 --> 21:42.940\n and looking at the universe\n\n21:42.940 --> 21:45.140\n as a information processing system,\n\n21:45.140 --> 21:46.740\n as a computer, as a giant computer.\n\n21:46.740 --> 21:48.560\n It's a giant computer.\n\n21:48.560 --> 21:50.900\n What's the power of thinking of the universe\n\n21:50.900 --> 21:52.340\n as an information processing system?\n\n21:52.340 --> 21:55.160\n Or what is perhaps its use\n\n21:55.160 --> 21:58.740\n besides the mathematical use of discussing black holes\n\n21:59.740 --> 22:02.820\n and your famous debates and ideas around that\n\n22:02.820 --> 22:06.080\n to human beings,\n\n22:06.080 --> 22:08.800\n or life in general as information processing systems?\n\n22:08.800 --> 22:11.500\n Well, all systems are information processing systems.\n\n22:13.300 --> 22:16.740\n You poke them, they change a little bit, they evolve.\n\n22:16.740 --> 22:18.340\n All systems are information processing systems.\n\n22:18.340 --> 22:21.420\n So there's no extra magic to us humans?\n\n22:22.660 --> 22:25.020\n It certainly feels, consciousness intelligence\n\n22:25.020 --> 22:26.060\n feels like magic.\n\n22:26.060 --> 22:26.900\n It sure does.\n\n22:26.900 --> 22:28.200\n Where does it emerge from?\n\n22:29.340 --> 22:31.740\n If we look at information processing,\n\n22:33.620 --> 22:35.100\n what are the emergent phenomena\n\n22:35.100 --> 22:37.500\n that come from viewing the world\n\n22:37.500 --> 22:39.880\n as an information processing system?\n\n22:39.880 --> 22:41.940\n Here is what I think.\n\n22:41.940 --> 22:43.540\n My thoughts are not worth much in this.\n\n22:43.540 --> 22:44.620\n If you ask me about physics,\n\n22:44.620 --> 22:46.660\n my thoughts may be worth something.\n\n22:46.660 --> 22:48.060\n If you ask me about this,\n\n22:48.060 --> 22:50.880\n I'm not sure my thoughts are worth anything.\n\n22:50.880 --> 22:53.280\n But as I said earlier,\n\n22:53.280 --> 22:55.780\n I think when we do introspection,\n\n22:55.780 --> 22:57.500\n when we imagine doing introspection\n\n22:57.500 --> 22:58.980\n and try to figure out what it is\n\n22:58.980 --> 23:00.540\n when we do when we're thinking,\n\n23:00.540 --> 23:03.500\n I think we get it wrong.\n\n23:03.500 --> 23:04.840\n I'm pretty sure we get it wrong.\n\n23:04.840 --> 23:07.260\n Everything I've heard about the way the brain functions\n\n23:07.260 --> 23:08.860\n is so counterintuitive.\n\n23:09.740 --> 23:14.380\n For example, you have neurons which detect vertical lines.\n\n23:14.380 --> 23:15.620\n You have different neurons\n\n23:15.620 --> 23:17.880\n which detect lines at 45 degrees.\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:19.420\n You have different neurons.\n\n23:19.420 --> 23:21.800\n I never imagined that there were whole circuits\n\n23:21.800 --> 23:25.380\n which were devoted to vertical lines in my brain.\n\n23:25.380 --> 23:28.100\n Doesn't seem to be the way my brain works.\n\n23:28.100 --> 23:31.140\n My brain seems to work if I put my finger up vertically\n\n23:31.140 --> 23:32.220\n or if I put it horizontally\n\n23:32.220 --> 23:33.380\n or if I put it this way or that way.\n\n23:33.380 --> 23:36.220\n It seems to me it's the same circuits.\n\n23:36.220 --> 23:37.680\n It's not the way it works.\n\n23:38.860 --> 23:41.460\n The way the brain is compartmentalized\n\n23:41.460 --> 23:43.660\n seems to be very, very different\n\n23:43.660 --> 23:45.580\n than what I would have imagined\n\n23:45.580 --> 23:49.660\n if I were just doing psychological introspection\n\n23:49.660 --> 23:51.940\n about how things work.\n\n23:51.940 --> 23:55.920\n My conclusion is that we won't get it right that way,\n\n23:55.920 --> 23:58.780\n that how will we get it right?\n\n23:59.640 --> 24:03.220\n I think maybe computer scientists will get it right eventually.\n\n24:03.220 --> 24:04.420\n I don't think there are any ways near it.\n\n24:04.420 --> 24:06.680\n I don't even think they're thinking about it,\n\n24:06.680 --> 24:11.440\n but eventually we will build machines perhaps\n\n24:11.440 --> 24:13.380\n which are complicated enough\n\n24:15.040 --> 24:18.340\n and partly engineered, partly evolved,\n\n24:18.340 --> 24:21.060\n maybe evolved by machine learning and so forth.\n\n24:21.060 --> 24:23.500\n This machine learning is very interesting.\n\n24:23.500 --> 24:26.020\n By machine learning, we will evolve systems\n\n24:26.020 --> 24:29.380\n and we may start to discover mechanisms\n\n24:30.320 --> 24:35.340\n that have implications for how we think\n\n24:35.340 --> 24:38.500\n and for what this consciousness thing is all about\n\n24:39.500 --> 24:42.060\n and we'll be able to do experiments on them\n\n24:42.060 --> 24:43.700\n and perhaps answer questions\n\n24:43.700 --> 24:48.700\n that we can't possibly answer by introspection.\n\n24:49.660 --> 24:51.700\n So that's a really interesting point.\n\n24:51.700 --> 24:55.240\n In many cases, if you look at even a string theory,\n\n24:55.240 --> 24:56.780\n when you first think about a system,\n\n24:56.780 --> 24:59.620\n it seems really complicated, like the human brain,\n\n24:59.620 --> 25:01.460\n and through some basic reasoning\n\n25:02.460 --> 25:07.060\n and trying to discover fundamental low level behavior\n\n25:07.060 --> 25:10.140\n of the system, you find out that it's actually much simpler.\n\n25:10.140 --> 25:13.580\n Do you, one, have you, is that generally the process\n\n25:13.580 --> 25:15.580\n and two, do you have that also hope\n\n25:15.580 --> 25:17.920\n for biological systems as well,\n\n25:17.920 --> 25:21.740\n for all the kinds of stuff we're studying at the human level?\n\n25:21.740 --> 25:23.080\n Of course, physics always begins\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:25.500\n by trying to find the simplest version of something\n\n25:25.500 --> 25:26.560\n and analyze it.\n\n25:26.560 --> 25:28.420\n Yeah, I mean, there are lots of examples\n\n25:28.420 --> 25:33.360\n where physics has taken very complicated systems,\n\n25:33.360 --> 25:36.980\n analyzed them and found simplicity in them for sure.\n\n25:36.980 --> 25:39.900\n I said superconductors before, it's an obvious one.\n\n25:39.900 --> 25:42.520\n A superconductor seems like a monstrously complicated thing\n\n25:42.520 --> 25:45.980\n with all sorts of crazy electrical properties,\n\n25:45.980 --> 25:48.380\n magnetic properties and so forth.\n\n25:48.380 --> 25:50.460\n And when it finally is boiled down\n\n25:50.460 --> 25:52.940\n to its simplest elements,\n\n25:52.940 --> 25:56.100\n it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon\n\n25:56.100 --> 25:58.300\n called spontaneous symmetry breaking,\n\n25:59.260 --> 26:04.260\n and which we, in other contexts, we learned about\n\n26:04.820 --> 26:06.760\n and we're very familiar with.\n\n26:06.760 --> 26:10.540\n So yeah, I mean, yes, we do take complicated things,\n\n26:10.540 --> 26:13.740\n make them simple, but what we don't want to do\n\n26:13.740 --> 26:16.540\n is take things which are intrinsically complicated\n\n26:16.540 --> 26:18.420\n and fool ourselves into thinking\n\n26:18.420 --> 26:20.640\n that we can make them simple.\n\n26:20.640 --> 26:22.380\n We don't want to make, I don't know who said this,\n\n26:22.380 --> 26:23.660\n but we don't want to make them simpler\n\n26:23.660 --> 26:26.740\n than they really are, okay?\n\n26:26.740 --> 26:30.820\n Is the brain a thing which ultimately functions\n\n26:30.820 --> 26:35.580\n by some simple rules or is it just complicated?\n\n26:35.580 --> 26:37.780\n In terms of artificial intelligence,\n\n26:37.780 --> 26:40.840\n nobody really knows what are the limits\n\n26:40.840 --> 26:43.020\n of our current approaches, you mentioned machine learning.\n\n26:43.020 --> 26:44.840\n How do we create human level intelligence?\n\n26:44.840 --> 26:48.220\n It seems that there's a lot of very smart physicists\n\n26:48.220 --> 26:51.260\n who perhaps oversimplify the nature of intelligence\n\n26:51.260 --> 26:53.660\n and think of it as information processing,\n\n26:53.660 --> 26:55.180\n and therefore there doesn't seem to be\n\n26:55.180 --> 26:59.100\n any theoretical reason why we can't artificially create\n\n27:00.820 --> 27:02.980\n human level or superhuman level intelligence.\n\n27:02.980 --> 27:04.540\n In fact, the reasoning goes,\n\n27:04.540 --> 27:07.300\n if you create human level intelligence,\n\n27:07.300 --> 27:08.660\n the same approach you just used\n\n27:08.660 --> 27:10.440\n to create human level intelligence\n\n27:10.440 --> 27:13.740\n should allow you to create superhuman level intelligence\n\n27:13.740 --> 27:16.000\n very easily, exponentially.\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:18.960\n So what do you think that way of thinking\n\n27:18.960 --> 27:22.260\n that comes from physicists is all about?\n\n27:22.260 --> 27:24.180\n I wish I knew, but there's a particular reason\n\n27:24.180 --> 27:25.140\n why I wish I knew.\n\n27:27.420 --> 27:29.360\n I have a second job.\n\n27:30.420 --> 27:34.860\n I consult for Google, not for Google, for Google X.\n\n27:34.860 --> 27:37.780\n I am the senior academic advisor\n\n27:39.060 --> 27:42.100\n to a group of machine learning physicists.\n\n27:43.740 --> 27:45.700\n Now that sounds crazy because I know nothing\n\n27:45.700 --> 27:46.700\n about the subject.\n\n27:47.780 --> 27:49.980\n I know very little about the subject.\n\n27:49.980 --> 27:52.180\n On the other hand, I'm good at giving advice,\n\n27:52.180 --> 27:53.660\n so I give them advice on things.\n\n27:53.660 --> 27:56.300\n Anyway, I see these young physicists\n\n27:56.300 --> 27:58.660\n who are approaching the machine learning problem.\n\n27:58.660 --> 28:00.900\n There is a real machine learning problem.\n\n28:00.900 --> 28:03.060\n Namely, why does it work as well as it does?\n\n28:03.060 --> 28:06.300\n Nobody really seems to understand\n\n28:06.300 --> 28:09.460\n why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations\n\n28:09.460 --> 28:11.640\n that it does and so forth.\n\n28:11.640 --> 28:14.980\n And there are three groups of people\n\n28:14.980 --> 28:17.460\n who have thought about this.\n\n28:17.460 --> 28:19.060\n There are the engineers.\n\n28:19.060 --> 28:21.580\n The engineers are incredibly smart,\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:23.800\n but they tend not to think as hard\n\n28:23.800 --> 28:26.080\n about why the thing is working\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:28.220\n as much as they do how to use it.\n\n28:28.220 --> 28:31.820\n Obviously, they provided a lot of data,\n\n28:31.820 --> 28:34.060\n and it is they who demonstrated\n\n28:34.060 --> 28:35.820\n that machine learning can work much better\n\n28:35.820 --> 28:37.380\n than you have any right to expect.\n\n28:37.380 --> 28:40.180\n The machine learning systems are systems.\n\n28:40.180 --> 28:41.940\n The system's not too different\n\n28:41.940 --> 28:44.900\n than the kind of systems that physicists study.\n\n28:44.900 --> 28:46.740\n There's not all that much difference\n\n28:46.740 --> 28:50.580\n between quantum, in the structure of mathematics,\n\n28:51.540 --> 28:54.480\n physically, yes, but in the structure of mathematics,\n\n28:54.480 --> 28:57.660\n between a tensor network designed\n\n28:57.660 --> 29:01.420\n to describe a quantum system on the one hand\n\n29:01.420 --> 29:05.100\n and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning.\n\n29:05.100 --> 29:08.940\n So there are more and more, I think,\n\n29:08.940 --> 29:10.940\n young physicists are being drawn\n\n29:10.940 --> 29:12.820\n to this field of machine learning,\n\n29:12.820 --> 29:15.100\n some very, very good ones.\n\n29:15.100 --> 29:16.820\n I work with a number of very good ones,\n\n29:16.820 --> 29:20.380\n not on machine learning, but on having lunch.\n\n29:20.380 --> 29:21.300\n On having lunch?\n\n29:21.300 --> 29:22.460\n Right.\n\n29:22.460 --> 29:23.860\n Yeah.\n\n29:23.860 --> 29:27.620\n And I can tell you they are super smart.\n\n29:27.620 --> 29:30.540\n They don't seem to be so arrogant\n\n29:30.540 --> 29:32.020\n about their physics backgrounds\n\n29:32.020 --> 29:35.100\n that they think they can do things that nobody else can do.\n\n29:35.100 --> 29:37.460\n But the physics way of thinking, I think,\n\n29:37.460 --> 29:40.900\n will add great value to,\n\n29:41.780 --> 29:43.980\n or will bring value to the machine learning.\n\n29:43.980 --> 29:45.740\n I believe it will.\n\n29:45.740 --> 29:47.140\n And I think it already has.\n\n29:47.980 --> 29:50.500\n At what time scale do you think\n\n29:50.500 --> 29:53.180\n predicting the future becomes useless\n\n29:53.180 --> 29:55.340\n in your long experience\n\n29:55.340 --> 29:57.680\n and being surprised at new discoveries?\n\n29:57.680 --> 30:02.680\n Well, sometimes a day, sometimes 20 years.\n\n30:03.480 --> 30:05.600\n There are things which I thought\n\n30:07.040 --> 30:09.840\n we were very far from understanding,\n\n30:09.840 --> 30:12.420\n which practically in a snap of the fingers\n\n30:12.420 --> 30:17.420\n or a blink of the eye suddenly became understood,\n\n30:17.440 --> 30:19.100\n completely surprising to me.\n\n30:21.220 --> 30:24.120\n There are other things which I looked at and I said,\n\n30:24.120 --> 30:27.320\n we're not gonna understand these things for 500 years,\n\n30:27.320 --> 30:29.280\n in particular quantum gravity.\n\n30:29.280 --> 30:32.840\n The scale for that was 20 years, 25 years.\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:33.800\n And we understand a lot\n\n30:33.800 --> 30:35.920\n and we don't understand it completely now by any means,\n\n30:35.920 --> 30:40.780\n but I thought it was 500 years to make any progress.\n\n30:40.780 --> 30:42.960\n It turned out to be very, very far from that.\n\n30:42.960 --> 30:45.200\n It turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:48.400\n from the time when I thought it was 500 years.\n\n30:48.400 --> 30:51.940\n So if we may, can we jump around quantum gravity,\n\n30:51.940 --> 30:53.720\n some basic ideas in physics?\n\n30:53.720 --> 30:58.720\n What is the dream of string theory mathematically?\n\n30:59.280 --> 31:00.120\n What is the hope?\n\n31:00.120 --> 31:01.440\n Where does it come from?\n\n31:01.440 --> 31:03.560\n What problem is it trying to solve?\n\n31:03.560 --> 31:05.000\n I don't think the dream of string theory\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:06.540\n is any different than the dream\n\n31:06.540 --> 31:09.560\n of fundamental theoretical physics altogether.\n\n31:09.560 --> 31:12.680\n Understanding a unified theory of everything.\n\n31:12.680 --> 31:15.040\n I don't like thinking of string theory\n\n31:15.040 --> 31:17.320\n as a subject unto itself\n\n31:17.320 --> 31:19.440\n with people called string theorists\n\n31:19.440 --> 31:21.560\n who are the practitioners\n\n31:21.560 --> 31:24.120\n of this thing called string theory.\n\n31:24.120 --> 31:28.160\n I much prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:32.060\n trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature,\n\n31:32.060 --> 31:33.400\n in particular gravity,\n\n31:33.400 --> 31:35.040\n in particular gravity and its connection\n\n31:35.040 --> 31:36.340\n with quantum mechanics,\n\n31:38.040 --> 31:41.320\n and who at the present time find string theory\n\n31:41.320 --> 31:44.520\n a useful tool rather than saying\n\n31:44.520 --> 31:46.440\n there's a subject called string theorists.\n\n31:46.440 --> 31:48.680\n I don't like being referred to as a string theorist.\n\n31:48.680 --> 31:53.680\n Yes, but as a tool, is it useful to think about our nature\n\n31:54.080 --> 31:57.500\n in multiple dimensions, the strings vibrating?\n\n31:57.500 --> 31:59.040\n I believe it is useful.\n\n31:59.040 --> 32:02.120\n I'll tell you what the main use of it has been up till now.\n\n32:02.120 --> 32:03.920\n Well, it has had a number of main uses.\n\n32:03.920 --> 32:06.360\n Originally, string theory was invented,\n\n32:06.360 --> 32:07.520\n and I know that I was there.\n\n32:07.520 --> 32:08.960\n I was right at the spot\n\n32:08.960 --> 32:13.080\n where it was being invented literally,\n\n32:13.080 --> 32:16.960\n and it was being invented to understand hadrons.\n\n32:16.960 --> 32:19.120\n Hadrons are subnuclear particles,\n\n32:19.120 --> 32:20.920\n protons, neutrons, mesons,\n\n32:21.960 --> 32:26.960\n and at that time, the late 60s, early 70s,\n\n32:28.580 --> 32:30.120\n it was clear from experiment\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:33.680\n that these particles called hadrons could vibrate,\n\n32:33.680 --> 32:36.800\n could rotate, could do all the things\n\n32:36.800 --> 32:39.640\n that a little closed string can do,\n\n32:39.640 --> 32:46.640\n and it was and is a valid and correct theory of these hadrons.\n\n32:47.920 --> 32:52.460\n It's been experimentally tested, and that is a done deal.\n\n32:53.940 --> 32:56.240\n It had a second life as a theory of gravity,\n\n32:56.240 --> 32:58.100\n the same basic mathematics,\n\n32:58.100 --> 33:01.320\n except on a very, very much smaller distance scale.\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:07.360\n The objects of gravitation are 19 orders of magnitude\n\n33:07.360 --> 33:10.080\n or orders of magnitude smaller than a proton,\n\n33:10.080 --> 33:12.000\n but the same mathematics turned up.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:14.300\n The same mathematics turned up.\n\n33:14.300 --> 33:15.980\n What has been its value?\n\n33:15.980 --> 33:20.720\n Its value is that it's mathematically rigorous in many ways\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:25.720\n and enabled us to find mathematical structures\n\n33:27.040 --> 33:30.120\n which have both quantum mechanics and gravity.\n\n33:30.120 --> 33:34.080\n With rigor, we can test out ideas.\n\n33:34.080 --> 33:35.160\n We can test out ideas.\n\n33:35.160 --> 33:37.240\n We can't test them in the laboratory.\n\n33:37.240 --> 33:39.840\n They're 19 orders of magnitude too small\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:41.280\n are things that we're interested in,\n\n33:41.280 --> 33:43.160\n but we can test them out mathematically\n\n33:43.160 --> 33:46.860\n and analyze their internal consistency.\n\n33:47.800 --> 33:52.800\n By now, 40 years ago, 35 years ago, and so forth,\n\n33:53.720 --> 33:57.120\n people very, very much questioned the consistency\n\n33:57.120 --> 33:59.240\n between gravity and quantum mechanics.\n\n33:59.240 --> 34:02.840\n Stephen Hawking was very famous for it, rightly so.\n\n34:02.840 --> 34:05.840\n Now, nobody questions that consistency anymore.\n\n34:05.840 --> 34:09.240\n They don't because we have mathematically precise\n\n34:09.240 --> 34:12.680\n string theories which contain both gravity\n\n34:12.680 --> 34:15.760\n and quantum mechanics in a consistent way.\n\n34:15.760 --> 34:20.760\n So it's provided that certainty that quantum mechanics\n\n34:21.280 --> 34:22.840\n and gravity can coexist.\n\n34:22.840 --> 34:24.160\n That's not a small thing.\n\n34:24.160 --> 34:25.000\n It's a very big thing.\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:25.840\n It's a huge thing.\n\n34:25.840 --> 34:27.240\n Einstein would be proud.\n\n34:27.240 --> 34:28.800\n Einstein, he might be appalled.\n\n34:28.800 --> 34:29.640\n I don't know.\n\n34:29.640 --> 34:30.460\n He didn't like it.\n\n34:30.460 --> 34:31.300\n He didn't like it.\n\n34:31.300 --> 34:32.920\n He might not be appalled, I don't know.\n\n34:32.920 --> 34:34.560\n He didn't like quantum mechanics very much,\n\n34:34.560 --> 34:36.360\n but he would certainly be struck by it.\n\n34:37.680 --> 34:40.060\n I think that may be, at this time,\n\n34:40.060 --> 34:42.000\n its biggest contribution to physics\n\n34:42.000 --> 34:45.360\n in illustrating almost definitively\n\n34:45.360 --> 34:46.800\n that quantum mechanics and gravity\n\n34:46.800 --> 34:48.640\n are very closely related\n\n34:48.640 --> 34:51.000\n and not inconsistent with each other.\n\n34:51.000 --> 34:53.840\n Is there a possibility of something deeper,\n\n34:53.840 --> 34:58.840\n more profound that still is consistent with string theory\n\n34:58.840 --> 35:03.120\n but is deeper, that is to be found?\n\n35:03.120 --> 35:04.900\n Well, you could ask the same thing about quantum mechanics.\n\n35:04.900 --> 35:05.740\n Is there something?\n\n35:05.740 --> 35:06.560\n Exactly.\n\n35:06.560 --> 35:07.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n35:07.400 --> 35:09.060\n I think string theory is just an example\n\n35:09.060 --> 35:11.000\n of a quantum mechanical system\n\n35:11.000 --> 35:15.660\n that contains both gravitation and quantum mechanics.\n\n35:16.600 --> 35:19.760\n So is there something underlying quantum mechanics?\n\n35:19.760 --> 35:21.560\n Perhaps something deterministic.\n\n35:21.560 --> 35:23.920\n Perhaps something deterministic.\n\n35:23.920 --> 35:27.360\n My friend, Ferad Etouf, whose name you may know,\n\n35:27.360 --> 35:29.600\n he's a very famous physicist.\n\n35:29.600 --> 35:32.240\n Dutch, not as famous as he should be, but...\n\n35:33.820 --> 35:35.160\n Hard to spell his name.\n\n35:35.160 --> 35:36.280\n It's hard to say his name.\n\n35:36.280 --> 35:37.520\n No, it's easy to spell his name.\n\n35:37.520 --> 35:39.240\n Apostrophe, he's the only person I know\n\n35:39.240 --> 35:41.080\n whose name begins with an apostrophe.\n\n35:42.040 --> 35:44.280\n And he's one of my heroes in physics.\n\n35:44.280 --> 35:45.160\n He's a little younger than me,\n\n35:45.160 --> 35:47.640\n but he's nevertheless one of my heroes.\n\n35:47.640 --> 35:52.640\n Etouf believes that there is some substructure to the world\n\n35:52.640 --> 35:55.640\n which is classical in character,\n\n35:55.640 --> 35:58.040\n deterministic in character,\n\n35:58.040 --> 36:00.520\n which somehow by some mechanism\n\n36:00.520 --> 36:03.840\n that he has a hard time spelling out\n\n36:03.840 --> 36:05.880\n emerges as quantum mechanics.\n\n36:07.400 --> 36:08.240\n I don't.\n\n36:08.240 --> 36:10.680\n The wave function is somehow emergent.\n\n36:10.680 --> 36:13.080\n The wave function, not just the wave function,\n\n36:13.080 --> 36:16.760\n but the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics,\n\n36:16.760 --> 36:19.760\n uncertainty, entanglement, all these things,\n\n36:19.760 --> 36:22.680\n are emergent. So you think quantum mechanics\n\n36:22.680 --> 36:23.800\n is the bottom of the well?\n\n36:23.800 --> 36:25.600\n Is the...\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:30.120\n Here I think is where you have to be humble.\n\n36:30.120 --> 36:31.440\n Here's where humility comes.\n\n36:31.440 --> 36:33.440\n I don't think anybody should say anything\n\n36:33.440 --> 36:36.360\n is the bottom of the well at this time.\n\n36:36.360 --> 36:39.240\n I think we can reasonably say,\n\n36:40.960 --> 36:44.200\n I can reasonably say when I look into the well,\n\n36:44.200 --> 36:47.240\n I can't see past quantum mechanics.\n\n36:47.240 --> 36:50.480\n I can't see past quantum mechanics.\n\n36:50.480 --> 36:52.800\n I don't see any reason for there to be anything\n\n36:52.800 --> 36:55.040\n beyond quantum mechanics.\n\n36:55.040 --> 36:58.200\n I think Etouf has asked very interesting\n\n36:58.200 --> 36:59.240\n and deep questions.\n\n36:59.240 --> 37:00.780\n I don't like his answers.\n\n37:01.960 --> 37:03.720\n Well, again, let me ask,\n\n37:03.720 --> 37:06.560\n if we look at the deepest nature of reality\n\n37:06.560 --> 37:08.320\n with whether it's deterministic\n\n37:09.320 --> 37:13.080\n or when observed as probabilistic,\n\n37:13.080 --> 37:16.960\n what does that mean for our human level\n\n37:16.960 --> 37:18.320\n of ideas of free will?\n\n37:18.320 --> 37:21.560\n Is there any connection whatsoever\n\n37:21.560 --> 37:24.700\n from this perception, perhaps illusion of free will\n\n37:24.700 --> 37:27.760\n that we have and the fundamental nature of reality?\n\n37:27.760 --> 37:31.400\n The only thing I can say is I am puzzled by that\n\n37:31.400 --> 37:32.680\n as much as you are.\n\n37:32.680 --> 37:33.520\n The illusion of it.\n\n37:33.520 --> 37:36.080\n The illusion of consciousness,\n\n37:36.080 --> 37:39.980\n the illusion of free will, the illusion of self.\n\n37:39.980 --> 37:43.380\n Does that connect to?\n\n37:43.380 --> 37:45.380\n How can a physical system do that?\n\n37:45.380 --> 37:48.820\n And I am as puzzled as anybody.\n\n37:48.820 --> 37:51.980\n There's echoes of it in the observer effect.\n\n37:51.980 --> 37:55.340\n So do you understand what it means to be an observer?\n\n37:55.340 --> 37:57.700\n I understand it at a technical level.\n\n37:57.700 --> 38:00.480\n An observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom\n\n38:00.480 --> 38:02.280\n that it can record information\n\n38:02.280 --> 38:03.980\n and which can become entangled\n\n38:03.980 --> 38:05.740\n with the thing that it's measuring.\n\n38:05.740 --> 38:07.300\n Entanglement is the key.\n\n38:07.300 --> 38:12.020\n When a system which we call an apparatus or an observer,\n\n38:12.020 --> 38:15.180\n same thing, interacts with the system\n\n38:15.180 --> 38:19.100\n that it's observing, it doesn't just look at it.\n\n38:19.100 --> 38:21.540\n It becomes physically entangled with it.\n\n38:21.540 --> 38:24.460\n And it's that entanglement which we call an observation\n\n38:24.460 --> 38:26.480\n or a measurement.\n\n38:26.480 --> 38:29.980\n Now, does that satisfy me personally as an observer?\n\n38:32.520 --> 38:33.360\n Yes and no.\n\n38:33.360 --> 38:34.300\n I find it very satisfying\n\n38:34.300 --> 38:36.680\n that we have a mathematical representation\n\n38:36.680 --> 38:40.340\n of what it means to observe a system.\n\n38:40.340 --> 38:44.300\n You are observing stuff right now, the conscious level.\n\n38:44.300 --> 38:48.100\n Do you think there's echoes of that kind of entanglement\n\n38:48.100 --> 38:49.420\n in our macro scale?\n\n38:49.420 --> 38:52.200\n Yes, absolutely, for sure.\n\n38:52.200 --> 38:53.780\n We're entangled with,\n\n38:53.780 --> 38:56.740\n quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room.\n\n38:56.740 --> 38:59.860\n If we weren't, then it would just,\n\n38:59.860 --> 39:01.760\n well, we wouldn't be observing it.\n\n39:03.140 --> 39:05.620\n But on the other hand, you can ask,\n\n39:05.620 --> 39:10.260\n do I really, am I really comfortable with it?\n\n39:10.260 --> 39:12.540\n And I'm uncomfortable with it in the same way\n\n39:12.540 --> 39:15.300\n that I can never get comfortable with five dimensions.\n\n39:15.300 --> 39:17.500\n My brain isn't wired for it.\n\n39:18.860 --> 39:21.380\n Are you comfortable with four dimensions?\n\n39:21.380 --> 39:22.620\n A little bit more,\n\n39:22.620 --> 39:26.340\n because I can always imagine the fourth dimension is time.\n\n39:26.340 --> 39:29.980\n So the arrow of time, are you comfortable with that arrow?\n\n39:29.980 --> 39:31.980\n Do you think time is an emergent phenomena\n\n39:31.980 --> 39:33.680\n or is it fundamental to nature?\n\n39:33.680 --> 39:37.560\n That is a big question in physics right now.\n\n39:37.560 --> 39:39.160\n All the physics that we do,\n\n39:40.160 --> 39:42.800\n or at least that the people that I am comfortable\n\n39:42.800 --> 39:47.800\n with talking to, my friends, my friends.\n\n39:49.400 --> 39:51.880\n No, we all ask the same question that you just asked.\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:55.240\n Space, we have a pretty good idea is emergent\n\n39:55.240 --> 40:00.240\n and it emerges out of entanglement and other things.\n\n40:00.240 --> 40:03.920\n Time always seems to be built into our equations\n\n40:03.920 --> 40:06.680\n as just what Newton pretty much would have thought.\n\n40:06.680 --> 40:09.140\n Newton, modified a little bit by Einstein,\n\n40:09.140 --> 40:10.380\n would have called time.\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:17.000\n And mostly in our equations, it is not emergent.\n\n40:19.200 --> 40:21.560\n Time in physics is completely symmetric,\n\n40:21.560 --> 40:22.400\n forward and backward.\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:23.400\n Right, it's symmetric.\n\n40:23.400 --> 40:27.300\n So you don't really need to think about the arrow of time\n\n40:27.300 --> 40:29.240\n for most physical phenomena.\n\n40:29.240 --> 40:33.400\n For most microscopic phenomena, no.\n\n40:33.400 --> 40:35.640\n It's only when the phenomena involve systems\n\n40:35.640 --> 40:38.960\n which are big enough for thermodynamics to become important,\n\n40:38.960 --> 40:41.680\n for entropy to become important.\n\n40:41.680 --> 40:46.020\n For a small system, entropy is not a good concept.\n\n40:47.960 --> 40:52.840\n Entropy is something which emerges out of large numbers.\n\n40:52.840 --> 40:56.600\n It's a probabilistic idea or it's a statistical idea\n\n40:56.600 --> 40:58.500\n and it's a thermodynamic idea.\n\n40:58.500 --> 41:00.840\n Thermodynamics requires lots and lots\n\n41:00.840 --> 41:04.120\n and lots of little substructures, okay?\n\n41:04.120 --> 41:09.120\n So it's not until you emerge at the thermodynamic level\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:11.720\n that there's an arrow of time.\n\n41:11.720 --> 41:13.560\n Do we understand it?\n\n41:13.560 --> 41:15.800\n Yeah, I think we understand better\n\n41:15.800 --> 41:17.160\n than most people think they have.\n\n41:17.160 --> 41:19.360\n Most people say they think we understand it.\n\n41:19.360 --> 41:21.280\n Yeah, I think we understand it.\n\n41:21.280 --> 41:23.900\n It's a statistical idea.\n\n41:23.900 --> 41:26.400\n You mean like second law of thermodynamics,\n\n41:26.400 --> 41:27.240\n entropy and so on?\n\n41:27.240 --> 41:29.720\n Yeah, take a pack of cards and you fling it in the air\n\n41:29.720 --> 41:32.480\n and you look what happens to it, it gets random.\n\n41:32.480 --> 41:33.400\n We understand it.\n\n41:33.400 --> 41:36.200\n It doesn't go from random to simple.\n\n41:36.200 --> 41:37.720\n It goes from simple to random.\n\n41:38.600 --> 41:41.820\n But do you think it ever breaks down?\n\n41:41.820 --> 41:46.180\n What I think you can do is in a laboratory setting,\n\n41:46.180 --> 41:49.020\n you can take a system which is somewhere intermediate\n\n41:49.020 --> 41:51.160\n between being small and being large\n\n41:53.080 --> 41:56.080\n and make it go backward.\n\n41:56.080 --> 41:59.560\n A thing which looks like it only wants to go forward\n\n41:59.560 --> 42:01.640\n because of statistical mechanical reasons,\n\n42:01.640 --> 42:03.920\n because of the second law,\n\n42:03.920 --> 42:07.120\n you can very, very carefully manipulate it\n\n42:07.120 --> 42:09.100\n to make it run backward.\n\n42:09.100 --> 42:11.400\n I don't think you can take an egg, a Humpty Dumpty\n\n42:11.400 --> 42:15.000\n who fell on the floor and reverse that.\n\n42:15.000 --> 42:18.480\n But you can, in a very controlled situation,\n\n42:18.480 --> 42:22.760\n you can take systems which appear to be evolving\n\n42:22.760 --> 42:25.360\n statistically toward randomness,\n\n42:25.360 --> 42:29.280\n stop them, reverse them, and make them go back.\n\n42:29.280 --> 42:30.800\n What's the intuition behind that?\n\n42:30.800 --> 42:31.940\n How do we do that?\n\n42:31.940 --> 42:33.520\n How do we reverse it?\n\n42:33.520 --> 42:35.600\n You're saying a closed system.\n\n42:35.600 --> 42:38.320\n Yeah, pretty much closed system, yes.\n\n42:38.320 --> 42:41.600\n Did you just say that time travel is possible?\n\n42:41.600 --> 42:44.080\n No, I didn't say time travel is possible.\n\n42:44.080 --> 42:45.960\n I said you can make a system go backward.\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:46.800\n In time.\n\n42:46.800 --> 42:48.040\n You can make it go back.\n\n42:48.040 --> 42:49.520\n You can make it reverse its steps.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:51.520\n You can make it reverse its trajectory.\n\n42:51.520 --> 42:52.400\n Yeah.\n\n42:52.400 --> 42:53.240\n How do we do it?\n\n42:53.240 --> 42:54.640\n What's the intuition there?\n\n42:54.640 --> 42:58.720\n Does it have, is it just a fluke thing\n\n42:58.720 --> 43:00.840\n that we can do at a small scale in the lab\n\n43:00.840 --> 43:01.680\n that doesn't have?\n\n43:01.680 --> 43:02.840\n Well, what I'm saying is you can do it\n\n43:02.840 --> 43:05.260\n a little bit better than a small scale.\n\n43:05.260 --> 43:10.260\n You can certainly do it with a simple, small system.\n\n43:10.480 --> 43:14.240\n Small systems don't have any sense of the arrow of time.\n\n43:14.240 --> 43:19.240\n Atoms, atoms are no sense of an arrow of time.\n\n43:20.580 --> 43:22.380\n They're completely reversible.\n\n43:22.380 --> 43:24.440\n It's only when you have, you know,\n\n43:24.440 --> 43:25.880\n the second law of thermodynamics\n\n43:25.880 --> 43:28.480\n is the law of large numbers.\n\n43:28.480 --> 43:30.800\n So you can break the law because it's not\n\n43:30.800 --> 43:31.640\n a deterministic law. You can break it,\n\n43:31.640 --> 43:33.880\n you can break it, but it's hard.\n\n43:33.880 --> 43:36.080\n It requires great care.\n\n43:36.080 --> 43:38.480\n The bigger the system is, the more care,\n\n43:38.480 --> 43:40.760\n the more, the harder it is.\n\n43:40.760 --> 43:43.880\n You have to overcome what's called chaos.\n\n43:43.880 --> 43:45.600\n And that's hard.\n\n43:45.600 --> 43:47.660\n And it requires more and more precision.\n\n43:47.660 --> 43:50.080\n For 10 particles, you might be able to do it\n\n43:50.080 --> 43:54.000\n with some effort.\n\n43:54.000 --> 43:56.760\n For a hundred particles, it's really hard.\n\n43:56.760 --> 43:59.340\n For a thousand or a million particles, forget it,\n\n43:59.340 --> 44:01.220\n but not for any fundamental reason,\n\n44:01.220 --> 44:03.720\n just because it's technologically too hard\n\n44:03.720 --> 44:05.660\n to make the system go backward.\n\n44:08.320 --> 44:13.320\n So, no time travel for engineering reasons.\n\n44:13.440 --> 44:15.280\n Oh, no, no, no, no.\n\n44:15.280 --> 44:16.880\n What is time travel?\n\n44:16.880 --> 44:19.280\n Time travel to the future?\n\n44:19.280 --> 44:20.400\n That's easy.\n\n44:20.400 --> 44:22.400\n You just close your eyes, go to sleep,\n\n44:22.400 --> 44:23.480\n and you wake up in the future.\n\n44:23.480 --> 44:25.960\n Yeah, yeah, a good nap gets you there, yeah.\n\n44:25.960 --> 44:27.400\n A good nap gets you there, right.\n\n44:27.400 --> 44:32.280\n But reversing the second law of thermodynamics,\n\n44:32.280 --> 44:36.760\n going backward in time for anything that's human scale\n\n44:36.760 --> 44:40.000\n is a very difficult engineering effort.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:41.440\n I wouldn't call that time travel\n\n44:41.440 --> 44:43.040\n because it gets too mixed up\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:46.040\n with what science fiction calls time travel.\n\n44:46.040 --> 44:51.040\n This is just the ability to reverse a system.\n\n44:51.040 --> 44:55.680\n You take the system and you reverse the direction\n\n44:55.680 --> 44:58.280\n of motion of every molecule in it.\n\n44:58.280 --> 45:00.940\n That, you can do it with one molecule.\n\n45:00.940 --> 45:03.500\n If you find a particle moving in a certain direction,\n\n45:03.500 --> 45:05.740\n let's not say a particle, a baseball,\n\n45:06.700 --> 45:10.960\n you stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion.\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:12.840\n In principle, that's not too hard.\n\n45:12.840 --> 45:15.240\n And it'll go back along its trajectory\n\n45:15.240 --> 45:16.440\n in the backward direction.\n\n45:16.440 --> 45:18.200\n Just running the program backwards.\n\n45:18.200 --> 45:19.480\n Running the program backward.\n\n45:19.480 --> 45:20.460\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n45:20.460 --> 45:22.400\n If you have two baseballs colliding,\n\n45:22.400 --> 45:23.520\n well, you can do it,\n\n45:23.520 --> 45:26.920\n but you have to be very, very careful to get it just right.\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:32.400\n If you have 10 baseballs, really, really, better yet,\n\n45:32.400 --> 45:36.200\n 10 billiard balls on an idealized,\n\n45:36.200 --> 45:37.820\n frictionless billiard table.\n\n45:38.840 --> 45:41.800\n Okay, so you start the balls all on a triangle, right?\n\n45:41.800 --> 45:43.440\n And you whack them.\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:44.640\n Depending on the game you're playing,\n\n45:44.640 --> 45:46.000\n you either whack them or you're really careful,\n\n45:46.000 --> 45:48.280\n but you whack them.\n\n45:48.280 --> 45:51.520\n And they go flying off in all possible directions.\n\n45:51.520 --> 45:53.140\n Okay, try to reverse that.\n\n45:54.720 --> 45:55.680\n Try to reverse that.\n\n45:55.680 --> 45:57.680\n Imagine trying to take every billiard ball,\n\n45:57.680 --> 46:00.320\n stopping it dead at some point,\n\n46:00.320 --> 46:01.680\n and reversing its motion\n\n46:01.680 --> 46:04.200\n so that it was going in the opposite direction.\n\n46:04.200 --> 46:07.340\n If you did that with tremendous care,\n\n46:07.340 --> 46:11.500\n it would reassemble itself back into the triangle.\n\n46:11.500 --> 46:14.520\n Okay, that is a fact.\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:16.860\n And you can probably do it with two billiard balls,\n\n46:16.860 --> 46:19.920\n maybe with three billiard balls if you're really lucky.\n\n46:19.920 --> 46:21.840\n But what happens is as the system\n\n46:21.840 --> 46:23.160\n gets more and more complicated,\n\n46:23.160 --> 46:26.120\n you have to be more and more precise\n\n46:26.120 --> 46:27.880\n not to make the tiniest error,\n\n46:27.880 --> 46:30.960\n because the tiniest errors will get magnified\n\n46:30.960 --> 46:33.920\n and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal.\n\n46:34.920 --> 46:38.560\n So yeah, but I wouldn't call that time travel.\n\n46:38.560 --> 46:39.680\n Yeah, that's something else.\n\n46:39.680 --> 46:43.240\n But if you think of it, it just made me think,\n\n46:43.240 --> 46:46.980\n if you think the unrolling of state\n\n46:46.980 --> 46:49.840\n that's happening as a program,\n\n46:49.840 --> 46:52.860\n if we look at the world,\n\n46:52.860 --> 46:56.440\n silly idea of looking at the world as a simulation,\n\n46:56.440 --> 46:57.360\n as a computer.\n\n46:59.080 --> 47:01.920\n But it's not a computer, it's just a single program.\n\n47:03.200 --> 47:06.320\n A question arises that might be useful.\n\n47:06.320 --> 47:11.320\n How hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe?\n\n47:11.320 --> 47:16.320\n Okay, so there are mathematical universes\n\n47:18.300 --> 47:20.040\n that we know about.\n\n47:20.040 --> 47:22.840\n One of them is called anti de Sitter space,\n\n47:22.840 --> 47:27.840\n where we, and it's quantum mechanics,\n\n47:28.520 --> 47:32.240\n I think we could simulate it in a computer,\n\n47:32.240 --> 47:34.140\n in a quantum computer.\n\n47:34.140 --> 47:36.600\n Classical computer, all you can do is solve its equations.\n\n47:36.600 --> 47:39.160\n You can't make it work like the real system.\n\n47:39.160 --> 47:41.600\n If we could build a quantum computer, a big enough one,\n\n47:41.600 --> 47:46.600\n a robust enough one, we could probably simulate a universe,\n\n47:49.880 --> 47:52.880\n a small version of an anti de Sitter universe.\n\n47:52.880 --> 47:55.800\n Anti de Sitter is a kind of cosmology.\n\n47:57.680 --> 48:00.100\n So I think we know how to do that.\n\n48:00.100 --> 48:02.340\n The trouble is the universe that we live in\n\n48:02.340 --> 48:04.840\n is not the anti de Sitter geometry,\n\n48:04.840 --> 48:07.320\n it's the de Sitter geometry.\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:11.120\n And we don't really understand its quantum mechanics at all.\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:12.120\n So at the present time,\n\n48:12.120 --> 48:14.000\n I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest idea\n\n48:14.000 --> 48:16.540\n how to simulate a universe similar to our own.\n\n48:18.020 --> 48:21.120\n No, we can ask, could we build in the laboratory\n\n48:21.120 --> 48:26.120\n a small version, a quantum mechanical version,\n\n48:27.720 --> 48:29.620\n the collection of quantum computers\n\n48:29.620 --> 48:32.880\n and tangled and coupled together,\n\n48:32.880 --> 48:37.880\n which would reproduce the phenomena that go on in the universe,\n\n48:38.120 --> 48:40.400\n even on a small scale.\n\n48:40.400 --> 48:43.060\n Yes, if it were anti de Sitter space,\n\n48:43.060 --> 48:44.680\n no, if it's de Sitter space.\n\n48:44.680 --> 48:47.400\n Can you slightly describe de Sitter space\n\n48:47.400 --> 48:48.640\n and anti de Sitter space?\n\n48:48.640 --> 48:49.860\n Yeah.\n\n48:49.860 --> 48:51.400\n What are the geometric properties of?\n\n48:51.400 --> 48:54.860\n They differ by the sign of a single constant\n\n48:54.860 --> 48:56.660\n called the cosmological constant.\n\n48:57.960 --> 49:01.760\n One of them is negatively curved,\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:03.680\n the other is positively curved.\n\n49:04.840 --> 49:08.260\n Anti de Sitter space, which is the negatively curved one,\n\n49:08.260 --> 49:11.360\n you can think of as an isolated system\n\n49:11.360 --> 49:14.620\n in a box with reflecting walls.\n\n49:14.620 --> 49:16.200\n You could think of it as a system\n\n49:16.200 --> 49:19.240\n of quantum mechanical system isolated\n\n49:19.240 --> 49:21.800\n in an isolated environment.\n\n49:21.800 --> 49:23.740\n De Sitter space is the one we really live in.\n\n49:23.740 --> 49:26.880\n And that's the one that's exponentially expanding,\n\n49:26.880 --> 49:30.040\n exponential expansion, dark energy,\n\n49:30.040 --> 49:31.520\n whatever we wanna call it.\n\n49:31.520 --> 49:34.300\n And we don't understand that mathematically.\n\n49:35.880 --> 49:36.960\n Do we understand?\n\n49:36.960 --> 49:38.200\n Not everybody would agree with me,\n\n49:38.200 --> 49:39.560\n but I don't understand.\n\n49:39.560 --> 49:40.600\n They would agree with me,\n\n49:40.600 --> 49:41.920\n they definitely would agree with me\n\n49:41.920 --> 49:43.300\n that I don't understand it.\n\n49:44.720 --> 49:48.480\n What about, is there an understanding of the birth,\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:50.320\n the origin, the big bang?\n\n49:50.320 --> 49:51.800\n So there's one problem with the other.\n\n49:51.800 --> 49:53.160\n No, no, there's theories.\n\n49:53.160 --> 49:54.160\n There are theories.\n\n49:55.840 --> 49:58.980\n My favorite is the one called eternal inflation.\n\n49:58.980 --> 50:00.680\n The infinity can be on both sides,\n\n50:00.680 --> 50:02.600\n on one of the sides and none of the sides.\n\n50:02.600 --> 50:05.520\n So what's eternal infinity?\n\n50:05.520 --> 50:06.360\n Okay.\n\n50:09.480 --> 50:11.120\n Infinity on both sides.\n\n50:13.040 --> 50:13.920\n Oh boy.\n\n50:13.920 --> 50:15.480\n Yeah, yeah, that's.\n\n50:15.480 --> 50:16.520\n Why is that your favorite?\n\n50:16.520 --> 50:21.520\n Because it's the most just mind blowing?\n\n50:21.520 --> 50:22.360\n No.\n\n50:22.360 --> 50:23.200\n Because we want a beginning.\n\n50:23.200 --> 50:24.980\n No, why do we want a beginning?\n\n50:26.800 --> 50:28.380\n In practice there was a beginning, of course.\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:31.280\n In practice there was a beginning.\n\n50:31.280 --> 50:36.280\n But could it have been a random fluctuation\n\n50:36.800 --> 50:39.320\n in an otherwise infinite time?\n\n50:39.320 --> 50:40.160\n Maybe.\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:45.840\n In any case, the eternal inflation theory,\n\n50:45.840 --> 50:47.280\n I think if correctly understood,\n\n50:47.280 --> 50:49.220\n would be infinite in both directions.\n\n50:50.680 --> 50:52.840\n How do you think about infinity?\n\n50:52.840 --> 50:53.960\n Oh God.\n\n50:53.960 --> 50:57.520\n So, okay, of course you can think about it mathematically.\n\n50:57.520 --> 51:01.480\n I just finished this discussion with my friend Sergei Brin.\n\n51:01.480 --> 51:02.800\n How do you think about infinity?\n\n51:02.800 --> 51:05.280\n I say, well, Sergei Brin is infinitely rich.\n\n51:07.960 --> 51:09.360\n How do you test that hypothesis?\n\n51:09.360 --> 51:10.200\n Okay.\n\n51:12.000 --> 51:13.240\n Such a good line.\n\n51:13.240 --> 51:14.080\n Right.\n\n51:15.400 --> 51:17.160\n Yeah, so there's really no way\n\n51:17.160 --> 51:18.800\n to visualize some of these things.\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:22.360\n Yeah, no, this is a very good question.\n\n51:22.360 --> 51:24.680\n Does physics have any,\n\n51:24.680 --> 51:27.360\n does infinity have any place in physics?\n\n51:27.360 --> 51:28.200\n Right.\n\n51:28.200 --> 51:32.600\n Right, and all I can say is very good question.\n\n51:35.840 --> 51:39.400\n So what do you think of the recent first image\n\n51:39.400 --> 51:43.040\n of a black hole visualized from the Horizon Telescope?\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:45.680\n It's an incredible triumph of science.\n\n51:45.680 --> 51:47.740\n In itself, the fact that there are black holes\n\n51:47.740 --> 51:50.620\n which collide is not a surprise.\n\n51:50.620 --> 51:52.640\n And they seem to work exactly\n\n51:52.640 --> 51:54.760\n the way they're supposed to work.\n\n51:54.760 --> 51:57.040\n Will we learn a great deal from it?\n\n51:57.040 --> 52:00.160\n I don't know, we might.\n\n52:00.160 --> 52:01.300\n But the kind of things we'll learn\n\n52:01.300 --> 52:03.280\n won't really be about black holes.\n\n52:05.240 --> 52:09.500\n Why there are black holes in nature\n\n52:09.500 --> 52:12.780\n of that particular mass scale and why they're so common\n\n52:12.780 --> 52:15.680\n may tell us something about the structure,\n\n52:15.680 --> 52:18.440\n evolution of structure in the universe.\n\n52:18.440 --> 52:19.520\n But I don't think it's gonna tell us\n\n52:19.520 --> 52:22.000\n anything new about black holes.\n\n52:22.000 --> 52:23.620\n But it's a triumph in the sense\n\n52:23.620 --> 52:25.420\n that you go back 100 years\n\n52:25.420 --> 52:28.200\n and it was a continuous development,\n\n52:28.200 --> 52:31.480\n general relativity, the discovery of black holes,\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:35.500\n LIGO, the incredible technology that went into LIGO.\n\n52:37.600 --> 52:42.600\n It is something that I never would have believed\n\n52:43.120 --> 52:47.760\n was gonna happen 30, 40 years ago.\n\n52:47.760 --> 52:51.840\n And I think it's a magnificent structure,\n\n52:51.840 --> 52:56.840\n magnificent thing, this evolution of general relativity,\n\n52:59.680 --> 53:03.980\n LIGO, high precision, ability to measure things\n\n53:03.980 --> 53:06.300\n on a scale of 10 to the minus 21.\n\n53:07.680 --> 53:09.400\n So, astonishing.\n\n53:09.400 --> 53:12.800\n So you're just in awe that this path\n\n53:12.800 --> 53:14.780\n took us to this picture.\n\n53:14.780 --> 53:15.840\n Is it different?\n\n53:17.480 --> 53:19.840\n You've thought a lot about black holes.\n\n53:19.840 --> 53:22.380\n How did you visualize them in your mind?\n\n53:23.560 --> 53:26.240\n And is the picture different than you've visualized it?\n\n53:26.240 --> 53:28.700\n No, it's simply confirmed.\n\n53:30.000 --> 53:32.720\n It's a magnificent triumph to have confirmed\n\n53:32.720 --> 53:37.320\n a direct observation that Einstein's theory of gravity\n\n53:37.320 --> 53:41.440\n at the level of black hole collisions actually works\n\n53:42.380 --> 53:45.600\n is awesome, it is really awesome.\n\n53:45.600 --> 53:48.160\n I know some of the people who are involved in that.\n\n53:48.160 --> 53:49.960\n They're just ordinary people.\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:54.440\n And the idea that they could carry this out,\n\n53:54.440 --> 53:56.460\n I just, I'm shocked.\n\n53:56.460 --> 53:59.360\n Yeah, just these little homo sapiens?\n\n53:59.360 --> 54:00.960\n Yeah, just these little monkeys.\n\n54:00.960 --> 54:04.800\n Yeah, got together and took a picture of...\n\n54:04.800 --> 54:06.680\n Slightly advanced limer's, I think.\n\n54:08.540 --> 54:11.320\n What kind of questions can science not currently answer\n\n54:11.320 --> 54:13.460\n but you hope might be able to soon?\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:15.080\n Well, you've already addressed them.\n\n54:15.080 --> 54:17.020\n What is consciousness, for example?\n\n54:17.020 --> 54:19.400\n You think that's within the reach of science?\n\n54:19.400 --> 54:21.640\n I think it's somewhat within the reach of science,\n\n54:21.640 --> 54:23.680\n but I think that now I think it's in the hands\n\n54:23.680 --> 54:27.120\n of the computer scientists and the neuroscientists.\n\n54:27.120 --> 54:29.520\n Not a physicist, with the help.\n\n54:29.520 --> 54:31.720\n Perhaps at some point, but I think physicists\n\n54:31.720 --> 54:34.640\n will try to simplify it down to something\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:36.320\n that they can use their methods\n\n54:36.320 --> 54:38.560\n and maybe they're not appropriate.\n\n54:38.560 --> 54:43.560\n Maybe we simply need to do more machine learning\n\n54:43.560 --> 54:47.800\n on bigger scales, evolve machines.\n\n54:47.800 --> 54:49.360\n Machines not only that learn\n\n54:49.360 --> 54:51.320\n but evolve their own architecture.\n\n54:51.320 --> 54:54.300\n As a process of learning, evolve in architecture.\n\n54:54.300 --> 54:56.960\n Not under our control, only partially under our control,\n\n54:56.960 --> 54:59.220\n but under the control of machine learning.\n\n55:00.320 --> 55:03.200\n I'll tell you another thing that I find awesome.\n\n55:03.200 --> 55:05.640\n You know this Google thing that they taught\n\n55:05.640 --> 55:07.480\n the computers how to play chess?\n\n55:07.480 --> 55:08.320\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n55:08.320 --> 55:10.680\n Okay, they taught the computers how to play chess,\n\n55:10.680 --> 55:12.440\n not by teaching them how to play chess,\n\n55:12.440 --> 55:14.400\n but just having them play against each other.\n\n55:14.400 --> 55:15.400\n Against each other, self play.\n\n55:15.400 --> 55:17.840\n Against each other, this is a form of evolution.\n\n55:18.800 --> 55:22.920\n These machines evolved, they evolved in intelligence.\n\n55:25.600 --> 55:27.400\n They evolved in intelligence\n\n55:27.400 --> 55:30.880\n without anybody telling them how to do it.\n\n55:30.880 --> 55:33.240\n They were not engineered, they just played\n\n55:33.240 --> 55:36.040\n against each other and got better and better and better.\n\n55:36.040 --> 55:41.040\n That makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence.\n\n55:43.500 --> 55:46.580\n What exact kind of intelligence, I don't know.\n\n55:46.580 --> 55:49.020\n But in understanding that better and better,\n\n55:49.020 --> 55:52.260\n maybe we'll get better clues as to what goes on\n\n55:52.260 --> 55:53.100\n in our own intelligence.\n\n55:53.100 --> 55:55.220\n What life in intelligence is.\n\n55:55.220 --> 55:58.700\n Last question, what kind of questions can science\n\n55:58.700 --> 56:01.820\n not currently answer and may never be able to answer?\n\n56:01.820 --> 56:02.660\n Yeah.\n\n56:02.660 --> 56:03.500\n Yeah.\n\n56:05.620 --> 56:07.300\n Is there an intelligence out there\n\n56:07.300 --> 56:09.260\n that's underlies the whole thing?\n\n56:09.260 --> 56:11.980\n You can call them with a G word if you want.\n\n56:11.980 --> 56:16.920\n I can say, are we a computer simulation with a purpose?\n\n56:18.960 --> 56:22.560\n Is there an agent, an intelligent agent\n\n56:22.560 --> 56:27.180\n that underlies or is responsible for the whole thing?\n\n56:27.180 --> 56:30.560\n Does that intelligent agent satisfy the laws of physics?\n\n56:30.560 --> 56:32.600\n Does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics?\n\n56:32.600 --> 56:34.460\n Is it made of atoms and molecules?\n\n56:34.460 --> 56:36.560\n Yeah, there's a lot of questions.\n\n56:36.560 --> 56:41.080\n And I don't see, it seems to me a real question.\n\n56:42.080 --> 56:43.500\n It's an answerable question.\n\n56:43.500 --> 56:44.800\n Well, I don't know if it's answerable.\n\n56:44.800 --> 56:47.360\n The questions have to be answerable to be real.\n\n56:49.300 --> 56:52.240\n Some philosophers would say that a question\n\n56:52.240 --> 56:54.520\n is not a question unless it's answerable.\n\n56:55.580 --> 56:58.300\n This question doesn't seem to me answerable\n\n56:58.300 --> 57:03.300\n by any known method, but it seems to me real.\n\n57:05.140 --> 57:07.180\n There's no better place to end.\n\n57:07.180 --> 57:08.660\n Leonard, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n57:08.660 --> 57:28.660\n Okay, good.\n\n"
