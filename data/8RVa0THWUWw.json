player\n\n00:06.460 --> 00:07.680\n of all time.\n\n00:07.680 --> 00:11.240\n From 1986 until his retirement in 2005,\n\n00:11.240 --> 00:13.360\n he dominated the chess world,\n\n00:13.360 --> 00:17.200\n ranking world number one for most of those 19 years.\n\n00:17.200 --> 00:18.880\n While he has many historical matches\n\n00:18.880 --> 00:20.840\n against human chess players,\n\n00:20.840 --> 00:24.040\n in the long arc of history he may be remembered\n\n00:24.040 --> 00:28.840\n for his match against the machine, IBM's Deep Blue.\n\n00:28.840 --> 00:31.840\n His initial victories and eventual loss to Deep Blue\n\n00:31.840 --> 00:34.680\n captivated the imagination of the world,\n\n00:34.680 --> 00:37.440\n of what role artificial intelligence systems may play\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:39.720\n in our civilization's future.\n\n00:39.720 --> 00:42.420\n That excitement inspired an entire generation\n\n00:42.420 --> 00:45.160\n of AI researchers, including myself,\n\n00:45.160 --> 00:47.240\n to get into the field.\n\n00:47.240 --> 00:51.320\n Gary is also a pro democracy political thinker and leader,\n\n00:51.320 --> 00:53.280\n a fearless human rights activist,\n\n00:53.280 --> 00:54.960\n and author of several books,\n\n00:54.960 --> 00:57.320\n including How Life Imitates Chess,\n\n00:57.320 --> 01:00.080\n which is a book on strategy and decision making,\n\n01:00.080 --> 01:01.400\n Winter is Coming,\n\n01:01.400 --> 01:03.560\n which is a book articulating his opposition\n\n01:03.560 --> 01:05.000\n to the Putin regime,\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:06.280\n and Deep Thinking,\n\n01:06.280 --> 01:07.680\n which is a book on the role\n\n01:07.680 --> 01:11.480\n of both artificial intelligence and human intelligence\n\n01:11.480 --> 01:13.560\n in defining our future.\n\n01:13.560 --> 01:16.520\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:16.520 --> 01:19.040\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:19.040 -->

Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:28.160 --> 01:32.400\n And now, here's my conversation with Gary Kasparov.\n\n01:33.460 --> 01:35.960\n As perhaps the greatest chess player of all time,\n\n01:35.960 --> 01:39.080\n when you look introspectively at your psychology\n\n01:39.080 --> 01:40.720\n throughout your career,\n\n01:40.720 --> 01:42.560\n what was the bigger motivator,\n\n01:42.560 --> 01:45.260\n the love of winning or the hatred of losing?\n\n01:46.940 --> 01:47.840\n Tough question.\n\n01:49.120 --> 01:51.800\n Have to confess I never heard it before,\n\n01:51.800 --> 01:53.720\n which is again, congratulations.\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:55.120\n It's quite an accomplishment.\n\n01:58.760 --> 02:01.200\n Losing was always painful.\n\n02:01.200 --> 02:04.480\n For me, it was almost like a physical pain\n\n02:04.480 --> 02:08.120\n because I knew that if I lost the game,\n\n02:09.640 --> 02:11.560\n it's just because I made a mistake.\n\n02:11.560 --> 02:16.480\n So I always believed that the result of the game\n\n02:18.160 --> 02:21.000\n had to be decided by the quality of my play.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.360\n Okay, you may say it sounds arrogant,\n\n02:24.360 --> 02:26.520\n but it helped me to move forward\n\n02:26.520 --> 02:30.080\n because I always knew that there was room for improvement.\n\n02:30.080 --> 02:31.120\n So it's the...\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:32.960\n Was there the fear of the mistake?\n\n02:32.960 --> 02:36.680\n Actually, fear of mistake guarantees mistakes.\n\n02:36.680 --> 02:40.180\n And the difference between top players at the very top\n\n02:40.180 --> 02:44.620\n is that it's the ability to make a decision\n\n02:44.620 --> 02:46.400\n without predictable consequences.\n\n02:46.400 --> 02:47.560\n You don't know what's happening.\n\n02:47.560 --> 02:48.680\n It's just intuitively.\n\n02:48.680 --> 02:50.600\n I can go this way or that way.\n\n02:50.600 --> 02:52.680\n And there are always hesitations.\n\n02:52.680 --> 02:55.040\n People are like, you are just at the crossroad.\n\n02:55.040 --> 02:57.240\n You can go right, you can go left, you can go straight.\n\n02:57.240 --> 02:58.760\n You can turn and go back.\n\n02:58.760 --> 03:03.160\n And the consequences are just very uncertain.\n\n03:03.160 --> 03:07.040\n Yes, you have certain ideas what happens on the right\n\n03:07.040 --> 03:09.020\n or on the left or on just if you go straight,\n\n03:09.020 --> 03:13.440\n but it's not enough to make well calculated choice.\n\n03:13.440 --> 03:16.400\n And when you play chess at the very top,\n\n03:16.400 --> 03:18.740\n it's about your inner strength.\n\n03:18.740 --> 03:21.080\n So I can make this decision.\n\n03:21.080 --> 03:24.880\n I will stand firm and I'm not going to waste my time\n\n03:24.880 --> 03:28.740\n because I have full confidence that I will go through.\n\n03:29.640 --> 03:32.160\n Going back to your original question is,\n\n03:32.160 --> 03:34.340\n I would say neither.\n\n03:34.340 --> 03:39.020\n It's just, it's love for winning, hate for losing.\n\n03:39.020 --> 03:41.640\n There were important elements, psychological elements,\n\n03:41.640 --> 03:46.640\n but the key element, I would say the driving force\n\n03:46.640 --> 03:51.640\n was always my passion for making a difference.\n\n03:53.320 --> 03:57.080\n It's just, I can move forward and I can always,\n\n03:57.080 --> 03:59.920\n I can always enjoy not just playing,\n\n03:59.920 --> 04:01.660\n but creating something new.\n\n04:01.660 --> 04:03.160\n Creating something new.\n\n04:03.160 --> 04:04.520\n How do you think about that?\n\n04:04.520 --> 04:07.440\n It's just finding new ideas in the openings,\n\n04:07.440 --> 04:09.580\n some original plan in the middle game.\n\n04:09.580 --> 04:13.300\n It's actually, that helped me to make the transition\n\n04:13.300 --> 04:15.920\n from the game of chess where I was on the very top\n\n04:15.920 --> 04:20.160\n to another life where I knew I would not be number one.\n\n04:20.160 --> 04:22.080\n I would not be necessarily on the top,\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:26.720\n but I could still be very active and productive\n\n04:26.720 --> 04:30.240\n by my ability to make a difference,\n\n04:30.240 --> 04:34.400\n by influencing people, say joining the democratic movement\n\n04:34.400 --> 04:36.580\n in Russia or talking to people\n\n04:36.580 --> 04:38.560\n about human machine relations.\n\n04:38.560 --> 04:41.920\n There's so many things where I knew my influence\n\n04:42.800 --> 04:45.720\n may not be as decisive as in chess,\n\n04:45.720 --> 04:49.040\n but still strong enough to help people\n\n04:49.040 --> 04:51.640\n to make their choices.\n\n04:51.640 --> 04:53.120\n So you can still create something new\n\n04:53.120 --> 04:57.160\n that makes a difference in the world outside of chess.\n\n04:57.160 --> 05:01.880\n But wait, you've kind of painted a beautiful picture\n\n05:01.880 --> 05:04.220\n of your motivations in chess to create something new,\n\n05:04.220 --> 05:08.460\n to look for those moments of some brilliant new ideas.\n\n05:09.320 --> 05:11.080\n But were you haunted by something?\n\n05:11.080 --> 05:15.120\n See, you make it seem like to be at the level you're at,\n\n05:15.120 --> 05:18.440\n you can get away without having demons,\n\n05:18.440 --> 05:21.760\n without having fears,\n\n05:21.760 --> 05:25.380\n without being driven by some of the darker forces.\n\n05:26.840 --> 05:29.640\n I mean, you sound almost religious.\n\n05:29.640 --> 05:32.800\n The darker forces, spiritual demons.\n\n05:32.800 --> 05:34.800\n I mean, do you have a call for a priest?\n\n05:34.800 --> 05:37.480\n That's what I'm dressing as.\n\n05:37.480 --> 05:42.400\n Now, just let's go back to these crucial chess moments\n\n05:42.400 --> 05:44.480\n where I had to make big decisions.\n\n05:44.480 --> 05:49.480\n As I said, it was all about my belief from very early days\n\n05:50.120 --> 05:52.920\n that I can make all the difference by playing well\n\n05:52.920 --> 05:53.960\n or by making mistakes.\n\n05:53.960 --> 05:57.080\n So yes, I always had an opponent\n\n05:57.080 --> 06:00.240\n across the chess board, opposite me.\n\n06:00.240 --> 06:02.920\n But no matter how strong the opponent was,\n\n06:02.920 --> 06:04.360\n whether it just was ordinary player\n\n06:04.360 --> 06:07.720\n or another world champion like Anatoly Karpov,\n\n06:09.400 --> 06:10.880\n having all respect for my opponent,\n\n06:10.880 --> 06:14.400\n I still believe that it's up to me to make the difference.\n\n06:14.400 --> 06:19.400\n And I knew I was not invincible.\n\n06:21.600 --> 06:22.560\n I made mistakes.\n\n06:22.560 --> 06:23.800\n I made some blunders.\n\n06:23.800 --> 06:28.240\n And with age, I made more blunders.\n\n06:28.240 --> 06:30.400\n So I knew it.\n\n06:30.400 --> 06:34.360\n But it's still, it's very much for me\n\n06:34.360 --> 06:37.000\n to be decisive factor in the game.\n\n06:37.000 --> 06:38.360\n I mean, even now, look, I just,\n\n06:38.360 --> 06:40.360\n my latest chess experience was horrible.\n\n06:40.360 --> 06:44.920\n I mean, I played Caruana, Fabi Caruana,\n\n06:44.920 --> 06:46.120\n this number two, number two,\n\n06:46.120 --> 06:47.840\n number three player in the world these days.\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:50.520\n We played this 960 with the Fischer,\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:52.960\n so called Fischer random chess, reshuffling pieces.\n\n06:52.960 --> 06:56.240\n Yeah, I lost very badly, but it's because I made mistakes.\n\n06:56.240 --> 06:57.720\n I mean, I had so many winning positions.\n\n06:57.720 --> 07:00.000\n I mean, 15 years ago, I would have crushed him.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:03.640\n So, and it's, you know, while I lost,\n\n07:03.640 --> 07:05.160\n I was not so much upset.\n\n07:05.160 --> 07:08.280\n I mean, I know, as I said in the interview,\n\n07:08.280 --> 07:10.840\n I can fight any opponent, but not my biological clock.\n\n07:10.840 --> 07:15.840\n So it's fighting time is always a losing proposition.\n\n07:16.600 --> 07:18.920\n But even today at age 56, you know,\n\n07:18.920 --> 07:22.120\n I knew that, you know, I could play great game.\n\n07:22.120 --> 07:24.400\n I couldn't finish it because I didn't have enough energy\n\n07:24.400 --> 07:25.560\n or just, you know,\n\n07:25.560 --> 07:27.640\n I couldn't have the same level of concentration.\n\n07:27.640 --> 07:29.720\n But, you know, in number of games\n\n07:29.720 --> 07:31.960\n where I completely outplayed one of the top players\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:35.360\n in the world, I mean, gave me a certain amount of pleasure.\n\n07:35.360 --> 07:38.440\n That is, even today, I haven't lost my touch.\n\n07:38.440 --> 07:40.320\n Not the same, you know.\n\n07:40.320 --> 07:43.080\n Okay, the jaws are not as strong\n\n07:43.080 --> 07:44.760\n and the teeth are not as sharp,\n\n07:44.760 --> 07:47.040\n but I could get to him just, you know,\n\n07:47.040 --> 07:49.240\n almost, you know, on the ropes.\n\n07:49.240 --> 07:50.080\n Still got it.\n\n07:50.080 --> 07:50.920\n Still got it.\n\n07:50.920 --> 07:52.320\n And it's, you know, and it's,\n\n07:52.320 --> 07:54.560\n I think it's, my wife said it well.\n\n07:54.560 --> 07:55.920\n I mean, she said, look, Gary,\n\n07:55.920 --> 07:59.720\n it's somehow, it's not just fighting your biological clock.\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:01.480\n It's just, you know, maybe it's a signal\n\n08:01.480 --> 08:03.720\n because, you know, the goddess of chess,\n\n08:03.720 --> 08:05.640\n since you spoke great about demons.\n\n08:05.640 --> 08:07.560\n The goddess of chess, Keisha,\n\n08:07.560 --> 08:09.000\n maybe she didn't want you to win\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:11.560\n because, you know, if you could beat\n\n08:12.480 --> 08:14.480\n number two, number three player in the world,\n\n08:14.480 --> 08:16.600\n I mean, that's one of the top players\n\n08:16.600 --> 08:19.280\n who just recently played World Championship match.\n\n08:19.280 --> 08:20.840\n If you could beat him,\n\n08:20.840 --> 08:23.040\n that would be really bad for the game of chess.\n\n08:23.040 --> 08:24.880\n But just, what people will say,\n\n08:24.880 --> 08:26.280\n oh, look, the game of chess, you know,\n\n08:26.280 --> 08:28.400\n it's not making any progress.\n\n08:28.400 --> 08:29.520\n The game is just, you know,\n\n08:29.520 --> 08:32.480\n it's totally devalued because, look,\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:34.080\n the guy coming out of retirement,\n\n08:34.080 --> 08:35.600\n you know, just, you know, winning games,\n\n08:35.600 --> 08:37.800\n maybe that was good for chess, not good for you.\n\n08:37.800 --> 08:41.520\n But it's, look, I've been following your logic.\n\n08:41.520 --> 08:43.480\n We should always look for, you know, demons,\n\n08:43.480 --> 08:46.360\n you know, superior forces and other things\n\n08:46.360 --> 08:48.960\n that could, you know, if not dominate our lives,\n\n08:48.960 --> 08:52.640\n but somehow, you know, play a significant role\n\n08:52.640 --> 08:55.560\n in the outcome.\n\n08:55.560 --> 08:58.240\n Yeah, so the goddess of chess had to send a message.\n\n08:58.240 --> 08:59.840\n Yeah, that's okay.\n\n08:59.840 --> 09:02.680\n So Gary, you should do something else.\n\n09:02.680 --> 09:04.000\n Time.\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:06.920\n Now for a question that you have heard before,\n\n09:06.920 --> 09:09.320\n but give me a chance.\n\n09:09.320 --> 09:12.280\n You've dominated the chess world for 20 years,\n\n09:12.280 --> 09:14.240\n even still got it.\n\n09:14.240 --> 09:15.880\n Is there a moment, you said,\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:17.560\n you always look to create something new.\n\n09:17.560 --> 09:21.320\n Is there games or moments\n\n09:21.320 --> 09:23.400\n where you're especially proud of\n\n09:23.400 --> 09:27.240\n in terms of your brilliance of a new creative move?\n\n09:27.240 --> 09:28.600\n You've talked about Mikhail Tal\n\n09:28.600 --> 09:31.840\n as somebody who was aggressive and creative chess player\n\n09:31.840 --> 09:33.480\n in your own game.\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:35.560\n Look, you mentioned Mikhail Tal.\n\n09:35.560 --> 09:39.400\n It's very aggressive, very sharp player,\n\n09:39.400 --> 09:42.280\n famous for his combinations and sacrifices,\n\n09:42.280 --> 09:44.120\n even called magician from Riga,\n\n09:44.120 --> 09:47.400\n so for his very unique style.\n\n09:47.400 --> 09:50.920\n But any world champion, you know,\n\n09:50.920 --> 09:53.160\n it's, yeah, was a creator.\n\n09:53.160 --> 09:57.600\n Some of them were so flamboyant and flash like Tal.\n\n09:57.600 --> 09:59.160\n Some of them were no just, you know,\n\n09:59.160 --> 10:04.000\n less discerned at the chess board like Tigran Petrosian,\n\n10:04.000 --> 10:07.120\n but every world champion, every top player\n\n10:07.120 --> 10:09.000\n brought something into the game of chess.\n\n10:09.000 --> 10:11.680\n And each contribution was priceless\n\n10:11.680 --> 10:13.680\n because it's not just about sacrifices.\n\n10:13.680 --> 10:15.920\n Of course, amateurs, they enjoy, you know,\n\n10:15.920 --> 10:18.800\n the brilliant games where pieces being sacrificed.\n\n10:18.800 --> 10:21.520\n It's all just, you know, it's all piece of hanging.\n\n10:21.520 --> 10:24.040\n And it's all of a sudden, you know,\n\n10:24.040 --> 10:26.320\n being material down, a rook down,\n\n10:26.320 --> 10:28.280\n or just, you know, queen down.\n\n10:28.280 --> 10:33.280\n The weaker side delivers the final blow\n\n10:33.880 --> 10:36.200\n on just, you know, mating opponent's king.\n\n10:36.200 --> 10:38.600\n But there are other kinds of beauty.\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:41.080\n I mean, it's a slow positional maneuvering,\n\n10:41.080 --> 10:42.520\n you know, looking for weaknesses\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:44.880\n and just, and gradually, you know,\n\n10:44.880 --> 10:47.280\n strangling your opponent\n\n10:47.280 --> 10:51.720\n and eventually delivering sort of a positional masterpiece.\n\n10:51.720 --> 10:55.280\n So I think I made more difference in the game of chess\n\n10:55.280 --> 10:58.800\n than I could have imagined when I started playing.\n\n10:58.800 --> 11:01.600\n And the reason I thought it was time for me to leave\n\n11:01.600 --> 11:04.680\n was just, I mean, I knew that I was not,\n\n11:05.560 --> 11:08.880\n I was not, no longer the position to\n\n11:10.360 --> 11:14.800\n bring the same kind of contribution,\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:18.320\n the same kind of new knowledge into the game.\n\n11:18.320 --> 11:21.640\n So, and going back,\n\n11:21.640 --> 11:24.160\n I could immediately look at my games\n\n11:24.160 --> 11:25.280\n against Anatoly Karpov.\n\n11:25.280 --> 11:27.800\n It's not just I won the match in 1985\n\n11:27.800 --> 11:31.160\n and became a world champion at age 22,\n\n11:31.160 --> 11:34.600\n but there were at least two games in that match.\n\n11:34.600 --> 11:36.680\n Of course, the last one, game 24,\n\n11:36.680 --> 11:38.120\n that was decisive game of the match,\n\n11:38.120 --> 11:40.760\n I won and became world champion.\n\n11:40.760 --> 11:45.640\n But also the way I won, it was a very sharp game\n\n11:45.640 --> 11:48.920\n and I found a unique maneuver that was absolutely new\n\n11:48.920 --> 11:52.280\n and it became some sort of just a typical now,\n\n11:52.280 --> 11:54.320\n though just when the move was made,\n\n11:55.200 --> 11:58.920\n was made on the board and put on display,\n\n11:58.920 --> 12:01.360\n a lot of people thought it was ugly.\n\n12:01.360 --> 12:03.600\n And another game, game 16 in the match\n\n12:03.600 --> 12:06.800\n where I just also managed to outplay Karpov completely\n\n12:06.800 --> 12:10.840\n with black pieces, just paralyzing his entire army\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:13.280\n in its own camp.\n\n12:13.280 --> 12:14.800\n Technically or psychologically,\n\n12:14.800 --> 12:17.560\n or was that a mix of both in game 16?\n\n12:17.560 --> 12:19.960\n Yeah, I think it was a big blow to Karpov.\n\n12:19.960 --> 12:21.840\n I think it was a big psychological victory\n\n12:21.840 --> 12:22.920\n for a number of reasons.\n\n12:22.920 --> 12:25.280\n One, the score was equal at the time\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:28.040\n and the world champion by the rules\n\n12:28.040 --> 12:30.760\n could retain his title in case of a tie.\n\n12:30.760 --> 12:35.080\n So we still have, before game 16, we have nine games to go.\n\n12:35.080 --> 12:37.080\n And also it was some sort of a bluff\n\n12:37.080 --> 12:41.520\n because neither me nor Karpov saw the refutation\n\n12:41.520 --> 12:42.840\n of this opening idea.\n\n12:42.840 --> 12:46.640\n And I think it says for Karpov, it was double blow\n\n12:46.640 --> 12:48.840\n because not that he lost the game, I should triple blow.\n\n12:48.840 --> 12:50.960\n He lost the game, it was a brilliant game\n\n12:50.960 --> 12:55.240\n and I played impeccably after just this opening bluff.\n\n12:55.240 --> 12:57.440\n And then they discovered that it was a bluff.\n\n12:57.440 --> 13:00.480\n So it's the, again, I didn't know, I was not bluffing.\n\n13:00.480 --> 13:03.160\n So that's why it happens very often.\n\n13:03.160 --> 13:04.520\n Some ideas could be refuted.\n\n13:04.520 --> 13:06.240\n And it's just, what I found out,\n\n13:06.240 --> 13:09.200\n and this is again, going back to your spiritual theme\n\n13:09.200 --> 13:13.000\n is that you could spend a lot of time working.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:16.400\n And when I say you could, it's in the 80s, in the 90s.\n\n13:16.400 --> 13:17.960\n It doesn't happen these days because everybody\n\n13:17.960 --> 13:18.880\n has a computer.\n\n13:18.880 --> 13:21.400\n You could immediately see if it works or it doesn't work.\n\n13:21.400 --> 13:24.600\n Machine shows your refutation in a split of a second.\n\n13:24.600 --> 13:28.640\n But many of the analysis in the 80s or in the 90s,\n\n13:28.640 --> 13:31.560\n they were not perfect simply because we're humans\n\n13:31.560 --> 13:34.080\n and just you analyze the game,\n\n13:34.080 --> 13:36.040\n you look for some fresh ideas.\n\n13:36.040 --> 13:39.280\n And then just it happens that there was something\n\n13:39.280 --> 13:42.720\n that you missed because the level of the concentration\n\n13:42.720 --> 13:45.960\n at the chess board is different from when you analyze\n\n13:45.960 --> 13:47.760\n the game, just moving the pieces around.\n\n13:47.760 --> 13:52.480\n And, but somehow if you spend a lot of time\n\n13:52.480 --> 13:55.360\n at the chess board preparing, so in your studies\n\n13:55.360 --> 13:59.880\n with your coaches, hours and hours and hours,\n\n13:59.880 --> 14:03.560\n and nothing of what you found could,\n\n14:03.560 --> 14:08.560\n had materialized on the chess board.\n\n14:08.920 --> 14:12.280\n Somehow these hours help, I don't know why,\n\n14:12.280 --> 14:14.200\n always helped you.\n\n14:14.200 --> 14:19.200\n It's as if the amount of work you did could be transformed\n\n14:19.640 --> 14:23.840\n into some sort of spiritual energy that helped you\n\n14:23.840 --> 14:27.400\n to come up with other great ideas during the board.\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:30.320\n Again, even if there was no direct connection\n\n14:30.320 --> 14:33.880\n between your preparation and your victory in the game,\n\n14:33.880 --> 14:37.760\n there was always some sort of invisible connection\n\n14:37.760 --> 14:39.880\n between the amount of work you did,\n\n14:39.880 --> 14:42.840\n your dedication to actually, and your passion\n\n14:42.840 --> 14:47.440\n to discover new ideas, and your ability during the game\n\n14:47.440 --> 14:49.320\n at the chess board, when the clock was ticking,\n\n14:49.320 --> 14:52.120\n we still had ticking clock, not digital clock at the time.\n\n14:52.120 --> 14:55.120\n So to come up with some brilliance.\n\n14:55.120 --> 14:59.800\n And I also can mention many games from the 90s.\n\n14:59.800 --> 15:04.240\n So it's the, obviously all amateurs would pick up my game\n\n15:04.240 --> 15:07.360\n against Veselin Topalov in 1999 and V. Konzai.\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:09.680\n Again, because it was a brilliant game,\n\n15:09.680 --> 15:13.560\n the Black King traveled from its own camp\n\n15:13.560 --> 15:17.760\n to into White's camp across the entire board.\n\n15:17.760 --> 15:20.600\n It doesn't happen often, trust me, as you know,\n\n15:20.600 --> 15:23.280\n in the games with professional players,\n\n15:23.280 --> 15:24.520\n top professional players.\n\n15:24.520 --> 15:26.720\n So that's why visually it was one\n\n15:26.720 --> 15:28.360\n of the most impressive victories.\n\n15:28.360 --> 15:33.280\n But I could bring to your attention many other games\n\n15:33.280 --> 15:37.600\n that were not so impressive for amateurs,\n\n15:37.600 --> 15:42.600\n not so beautiful, just because it's sacrifice\n\n15:43.080 --> 15:44.840\n is always beautiful, you sacrifice pieces.\n\n15:44.840 --> 15:48.840\n And then eventually you have very few resources left\n\n15:48.840 --> 15:53.840\n and you use them just to crush your opponent basically.\n\n15:54.720 --> 15:58.240\n You have to make the king because you have almost\n\n15:58.240 --> 16:01.280\n nothing left at your disposal.\n\n16:01.280 --> 16:06.160\n But up to the very end, again, less and less,\n\n16:06.160 --> 16:08.880\n but still up to the very end, I always had games\n\n16:08.880 --> 16:11.880\n with some sort of interesting ideas\n\n16:11.880 --> 16:14.800\n and games that gave me great satisfaction.\n\n16:14.800 --> 16:19.800\n But I think it's what happened from 2005 up to these days\n\n16:20.840 --> 16:24.600\n was also a very big accomplishment\n\n16:24.600 --> 16:28.640\n since I had to find myself to sort of relocate myself.\n\n16:28.640 --> 16:30.680\n Yeah, rechannel the creative energies.\n\n16:30.680 --> 16:35.680\n Exactly, and to find something where I feel comfortable,\n\n16:35.680 --> 16:39.440\n even confident that my participation\n\n16:39.440 --> 16:41.400\n still makes the difference.\n\n16:41.400 --> 16:42.560\n Beautifully put.\n\n16:42.560 --> 16:44.880\n So let me ask perhaps a silly question,\n\n16:44.880 --> 16:48.440\n but sticking on chest for just a little longer.\n\n16:48.440 --> 16:51.120\n Where do you put Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion\n\n16:51.120 --> 16:52.880\n in the list of all time greats?\n\n16:54.200 --> 16:57.880\n In terms of style, moments of brilliance, consistency.\n\n16:57.880 --> 16:59.520\n It's a tricky question.\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:02.600\n The moment you start ranking world champions.\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:04.560\n Yeah, you lose something?\n\n17:04.560 --> 17:09.560\n I think it's not fair because any new generation\n\n17:12.040 --> 17:15.120\n knows much more about the game than the previous one.\n\n17:15.120 --> 17:17.640\n So when people say, oh, Gary was the greatest,\n\n17:17.640 --> 17:19.680\n Fischer was the greatest, Magnus was the greatest,\n\n17:19.680 --> 17:24.360\n it disregard the fact that the great players of the past,\n\n17:24.360 --> 17:26.800\n whether it was Alaskia, Capoplank, Alokian,\n\n17:26.800 --> 17:28.800\n I mean, they knew so little about chess\n\n17:28.800 --> 17:29.920\n by today's standards.\n\n17:29.920 --> 17:32.640\n I mean, today, just any kid that spent a few years\n\n17:32.640 --> 17:37.520\n with his or her chess computer knows much more\n\n17:37.520 --> 17:40.080\n about the game simply just because you have access\n\n17:40.080 --> 17:40.960\n to this information.\n\n17:40.960 --> 17:43.480\n And it has been discovered generation after generation.\n\n17:43.480 --> 17:46.880\n We added more and more knowledge to the game of chess.\n\n17:46.880 --> 17:50.360\n It's about the gap between the world champion\n\n17:50.360 --> 17:51.720\n and the rest of the field.\n\n17:51.720 --> 17:55.240\n So it's the, now, if you look at the gap,\n\n17:55.240 --> 17:58.280\n then probably Fischer could be on top,\n\n17:58.280 --> 17:59.800\n but very short period of time.\n\n17:59.800 --> 18:01.960\n Then you should also add a time factor.\n\n18:01.960 --> 18:05.640\n I was on top, not as big as Fischer, but much longer.\n\n18:05.640 --> 18:08.440\n So, and also, unlike Fischer,\n\n18:08.440 --> 18:11.760\n I succeeded in beating next generation.\n\n18:11.760 --> 18:13.240\n Here's the question.\n\n18:13.240 --> 18:14.800\n Let's see if you still got the fire,\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:15.960\n speaking of the next generation,\n\n18:15.960 --> 18:19.000\n because you did succeed beating the next generation.\n\n18:19.000 --> 18:19.840\n It's close.\n\n18:19.840 --> 18:22.920\n Okay, Anand, Short, Anand, the sheer of,\n\n18:22.920 --> 18:24.440\n Kramnik is already 12 years younger.\n\n18:24.440 --> 18:25.560\n So that's the next.\n\n18:25.560 --> 18:28.200\n But still yet, I competed with them\n\n18:28.200 --> 18:30.000\n and I just, I beat most of them.\n\n18:30.000 --> 18:34.200\n And I was still dominant when I left at age of 41.\n\n18:34.200 --> 18:36.800\n So back to Magnus.\n\n18:36.800 --> 18:40.240\n Magnus, I mean, consistency is phenomenal.\n\n18:40.240 --> 18:42.920\n The reason Magnus is on top,\n\n18:42.920 --> 18:46.640\n and it seems unbeatable today,\n\n18:46.640 --> 18:50.680\n Magnus is a lethal combination of Fischer and Karpov,\n\n18:50.680 --> 18:52.920\n which is very, it's very unusual\n\n18:52.920 --> 18:54.840\n because Fischer's style was very dynamic,\n\n18:54.840 --> 18:56.800\n just fighting to the last point,\n\n18:56.800 --> 18:59.120\n just using every resource available.\n\n18:59.120 --> 19:01.320\n Karpov was very different.\n\n19:01.320 --> 19:04.680\n It's just an unparalleled ability\n\n19:04.680 --> 19:07.600\n to use every piece with a maximum effect.\n\n19:07.600 --> 19:12.040\n Just its minimal resources always produce maximum effect.\n\n19:12.040 --> 19:15.160\n So now imagine that you merge these two styles.\n\n19:15.160 --> 19:17.160\n So it's like, you know,\n\n19:17.160 --> 19:20.080\n it's squeezing every stone for a drop of water,\n\n19:21.280 --> 19:22.880\n but doing it, you know, just, you know,\n\n19:22.880 --> 19:25.080\n for 50, 60, 70, 80 moves.\n\n19:25.080 --> 19:27.280\n I mean, Magnus could go on as long as Fischer\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:28.920\n with all his passion and energy.\n\n19:28.920 --> 19:31.440\n And at the same time being as meticulous\n\n19:31.440 --> 19:35.200\n and deadly as Karpov by just, you know,\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:36.840\n using every little advantage.\n\n19:36.840 --> 19:40.560\n So, and he has good, you know, very good health.\n\n19:40.560 --> 19:41.400\n It's important.\n\n19:41.400 --> 19:42.600\n I mean, physical conditions are, by the way,\n\n19:42.600 --> 19:43.440\n very important.\n\n19:43.440 --> 19:44.720\n So a lot of people don't recognize it.\n\n19:44.720 --> 19:46.920\n Their latest study shows that chess players\n\n19:46.920 --> 19:50.920\n burn thousands of calories during the game.\n\n19:50.920 --> 19:54.480\n So that puts him on the top of this field\n\n19:54.480 --> 19:56.000\n of the world champions.\n\n19:56.000 --> 19:59.440\n But again, it's the discussion that is,\n\n19:59.440 --> 20:00.720\n I saw recently on the internet,\n\n20:00.720 --> 20:03.200\n whether Garry Kasparov of his peak,\n\n20:03.200 --> 20:06.600\n let's say late eighties, could beat Magnus Carlsen today.\n\n20:06.600 --> 20:07.600\n I mean, it's certainly irrelevant\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:10.920\n because Garry Kasparov in 1989, okay,\n\n20:10.920 --> 20:12.760\n has played great chess,\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:15.200\n but still I knew very little about chess\n\n20:15.200 --> 20:17.160\n compared to Magnus Carlsen in 2019,\n\n20:17.160 --> 20:18.840\n who by the way, learned from me as well.\n\n20:18.840 --> 20:20.480\n So that's why, yeah.\n\n20:20.480 --> 20:24.040\n I'm extremely cautious in making any judgment\n\n20:24.040 --> 20:26.560\n that involves, you know, time gaps.\n\n20:26.560 --> 20:28.720\n You ask, you know, soccer fans.\n\n20:28.720 --> 20:30.120\n So who is your favorite?\n\n20:30.120 --> 20:31.960\n Pele, Maradona, or Messi?\n\n20:31.960 --> 20:32.800\n Yeah.\n\n20:32.800 --> 20:33.960\n Yeah, who's your favorite?\n\n20:33.960 --> 20:34.800\n Messi.\n\n20:34.800 --> 20:35.640\n Messi.\n\n20:35.640 --> 20:36.720\n Yeah, why?\n\n20:36.720 --> 20:37.560\n Because?\n\n20:37.560 --> 20:38.520\n Maybe Maradona, maybe.\n\n20:38.520 --> 20:40.040\n Not because you're younger, but that's simple.\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:41.720\n Your instinctive answer is correct\n\n20:41.720 --> 20:44.480\n because you saw, you didn't see Maradona in action.\n\n20:44.480 --> 20:45.880\n I saw all of them in action.\n\n20:45.880 --> 20:48.080\n So that's why, but since, you know,\n\n20:48.080 --> 20:50.240\n when I was, you know, just following it, you know,\n\n20:50.240 --> 20:52.800\n just Pele and Maradona, they were just, you know,\n\n20:52.800 --> 20:55.280\n they were big stars and it's, Messi's already just,\n\n20:55.280 --> 20:58.800\n I was gradually losing interest in just other things.\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:02.240\n So I remember Pele in 1970, the final match Brazil Italy.\n\n21:02.240 --> 21:05.720\n So that's the first World Cup soccer I watched.\n\n21:05.720 --> 21:09.280\n So that's the, and actually my answer when I just,\n\n21:09.280 --> 21:10.400\n when I just, you know,\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:12.480\n because I was asked this question as well.\n\n21:12.480 --> 21:13.840\n So I say that it's just,\n\n21:13.840 --> 21:15.640\n while it's impossible to make a choice,\n\n21:15.640 --> 21:18.440\n I would still probably go with Maradona for simple reason.\n\n21:18.440 --> 21:21.960\n The Brazilian team in 1970 could have won without Pele.\n\n21:21.960 --> 21:23.200\n It was absolutely great.\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:26.280\n Still could have won, maybe, but it is,\n\n21:26.280 --> 21:28.720\n Argentinian team in 1986 without Maradona\n\n21:28.720 --> 21:29.760\n would not be in the final.\n\n21:29.760 --> 21:33.880\n So this is, and Messi, he still hasn't won a title.\n\n21:33.880 --> 21:35.600\n You could argue for that for an hour,\n\n21:35.600 --> 21:38.680\n but you could say, if you ask Maradona,\n\n21:38.680 --> 21:40.680\n if you look in his eyes, especially,\n\n21:40.680 --> 21:43.520\n let's say Gary Kasparov in 1989,\n\n21:43.520 --> 21:45.200\n he would have said,\n\n21:45.200 --> 21:48.560\n I was sure as hell would beat Magnus Carlsen.\n\n21:48.560 --> 21:50.480\n Just simply because. The confidence, the fire.\n\n21:50.480 --> 21:54.080\n Simply because, again, they saw me in action.\n\n21:54.080 --> 21:56.880\n So this, again, it's the age factor that's important.\n\n21:56.880 --> 21:58.640\n Definitely with the passion and energy\n\n21:58.640 --> 22:01.720\n and being equipped with all modern ideas.\n\n22:01.720 --> 22:04.040\n But again, then you make, you know,\n\n22:04.040 --> 22:05.880\n a very just important assumption\n\n22:05.880 --> 22:08.720\n that you could empower Gary Kasparov in 1989\n\n22:08.720 --> 22:11.560\n with all ideas that have been accumulated over 30 years.\n\n22:11.560 --> 22:12.720\n That would not be Gary Kasparov.\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:14.320\n That would be someone else.\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:16.280\n Because again, I belong to 1989.\n\n22:16.280 --> 22:18.960\n I was way ahead of the field.\n\n22:18.960 --> 22:21.840\n And I beat Karpov several times\n\n22:21.840 --> 22:23.240\n in the World Championship matches.\n\n22:23.240 --> 22:26.440\n And I crossed 2800, which, by the way,\n\n22:26.440 --> 22:28.480\n if you look at the, in the rating,\n\n22:28.480 --> 22:31.480\n which is just, even today,\n\n22:31.480 --> 22:33.680\n so this is the rating that I retire.\n\n22:33.680 --> 22:37.120\n So it's still, you know, it's just, it's a top two, three.\n\n22:37.120 --> 22:38.840\n So that's Caruana and Ding.\n\n22:38.840 --> 22:40.600\n It's about the same rating now.\n\n22:40.600 --> 22:43.440\n And I crossed 2800 in 1990.\n\n22:43.440 --> 22:45.000\n Well, just you look at the inflation.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.440\n When I crossed 2800 in 1990,\n\n22:47.440 --> 22:49.720\n there was only one player in 2700 category,\n\n22:49.720 --> 22:50.720\n and not only Karpov.\n\n22:50.720 --> 22:52.240\n Now we had more than 50.\n\n22:52.240 --> 22:55.160\n So just, when you see this, so if you add inflation,\n\n22:55.160 --> 22:58.160\n so I think my 2851, it could probably,\n\n22:58.160 --> 23:02.160\n could be more valuable as Magnus 2882,\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:04.240\n which was his highest rating.\n\n23:04.240 --> 23:07.080\n But anyway, again, too many hypotheticals.\n\n23:07.080 --> 23:10.960\n You're lost to IBM Deep Blue in 1997.\n\n23:10.960 --> 23:13.440\n In my eyes, that is one of the most seminal moments\n\n23:13.440 --> 23:15.040\n in the history.\n\n23:15.040 --> 23:18.560\n Again, I apologize for being romanticizing the notion,\n\n23:18.560 --> 23:20.520\n but in the history of our civilization,\n\n23:20.520 --> 23:25.280\n because humans, as the civilizations,\n\n23:25.280 --> 23:27.200\n for centuries saw chess as, you know,\n\n23:27.200 --> 23:29.360\n the peak of what man can accomplish\n\n23:29.360 --> 23:31.720\n of intellectual mastery, right?\n\n23:31.720 --> 23:36.600\n And that moment when a machine could beat a human being\n\n23:36.600 --> 23:40.240\n was inspiring to just an entire,\n\n23:40.240 --> 23:43.360\n anyone who cares about science, innovation,\n\n23:43.360 --> 23:46.280\n an entire generation of AI researchers.\n\n23:46.280 --> 23:50.800\n And yet, to you that loss, at least if reading your face,\n\n23:50.800 --> 23:53.640\n was, seemed like a tragedy, extremely painful.\n\n23:53.640 --> 23:55.560\n Like you said, physically painful.\n\n23:55.560 --> 23:56.560\n Why?\n\n23:56.560 --> 23:59.720\n When you look back at your psychology of that loss,\n\n23:59.720 --> 24:01.240\n why was it so painful?\n\n24:01.240 --> 24:05.640\n Were you not able to see the seminal nature of that moment?\n\n24:07.240 --> 24:10.240\n Or was that exactly why it was that painful?\n\n24:10.240 --> 24:15.240\n As I already said, losing was painful, physically painful.\n\n24:17.040 --> 24:18.960\n And the match I lost in 1997\n\n24:18.960 --> 24:22.000\n was not the first match I lost to a machine.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:23.720\n It was the first match I lost, period.\n\n24:23.720 --> 24:24.560\n Yeah.\n\n24:24.560 --> 24:25.400\n That's...\n\n24:27.120 --> 24:28.440\n Oh, wow.\n\n24:28.440 --> 24:29.280\n So...\n\n24:29.280 --> 24:30.400\n Oh, wow.\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:31.800\n Yeah, it's...\n\n24:31.800 --> 24:32.640\n Right.\n\n24:32.640 --> 24:35.840\n Yeah, that makes all the difference to me.\n\n24:35.840 --> 24:36.680\n Yes.\n\n24:36.680 --> 24:38.360\n First time I lost, it's just...\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:42.360\n Now, I lost, and the reason I was so angry\n\n24:42.360 --> 24:46.120\n that I just, you know, I had suspicions\n\n24:46.120 --> 24:49.160\n that my loss was not just a result of my bad play.\n\n24:49.160 --> 24:50.000\n Yes.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:51.520\n So though I played quite poorly, you know,\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:53.240\n just when you started looking at the games today,\n\n24:53.240 --> 24:54.880\n I made tons of mistakes.\n\n24:54.880 --> 24:57.760\n But, you know, I had all reasons to believe that,\n\n24:57.760 --> 25:00.160\n you know, there were other factors\n\n25:00.160 --> 25:01.720\n that had nothing to do with the game of chess.\n\n25:01.720 --> 25:02.920\n And that's why I was angry.\n\n25:02.920 --> 25:05.440\n But look, it was 22 years ago.\n\n25:05.440 --> 25:07.200\n It's water under the bridge.\n\n25:07.200 --> 25:08.920\n We can analyze this match,\n\n25:08.920 --> 25:10.640\n and this is with everything you said.\n\n25:10.640 --> 25:13.280\n I agree with probably one exception,\n\n25:13.280 --> 25:16.360\n is that considering chess, you know,\n\n25:16.360 --> 25:20.200\n as the sort of, as a pinnacle of intellectual activities,\n\n25:20.200 --> 25:21.320\n was our mistake.\n\n25:21.320 --> 25:22.960\n Because, you know, we just thought,\n\n25:22.960 --> 25:25.680\n oh, it's a game of the highest intellect,\n\n25:25.680 --> 25:27.480\n and it's just, you know, you have to be so,\n\n25:27.480 --> 25:29.560\n you know, intelligent, and you could see things\n\n25:29.560 --> 25:34.560\n that, you know, the ordinary mortals could not see.\n\n25:34.560 --> 25:39.560\n It's a game, and all machines had to do with this game\n\n25:40.080 --> 25:43.040\n is just to make fewer mistakes, not to solve the game.\n\n25:43.040 --> 25:44.600\n Because the game cannot be solved.\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:45.760\n I mean, according to Kovalevich Shannon,\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:49.040\n the number of legal moves is 10 to the 46th power.\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:51.680\n Too many zeros, so just for any computer\n\n25:51.680 --> 25:56.680\n to finish the job, you know, in next few billion years.\n\n25:57.560 --> 25:59.120\n But it doesn't have to.\n\n25:59.120 --> 26:01.480\n It's all about making fewer mistakes.\n\n26:01.480 --> 26:03.560\n And I think that's the, this match,\n\n26:03.560 --> 26:06.000\n this match actually, and what's happened afterwards\n\n26:06.000 --> 26:11.000\n with other games, with Go, with Shoggy, with video games.\n\n26:12.640 --> 26:17.320\n It's a demonstration that machines will always be humans\n\n26:17.320 --> 26:19.360\n in what I call closed systems.\n\n26:19.360 --> 26:22.000\n The moment you build a closed system,\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:26.040\n no matter how the system's called, chess, Go, Shoggy,\n\n26:26.040 --> 26:31.040\n Dota, machines will prevail simply because they will\n\n26:31.040 --> 26:34.800\n bring down a number of mistakes.\n\n26:34.800 --> 26:38.320\n Machines don't have to solve it, they just have to,\n\n26:38.320 --> 26:41.080\n the way they outplay us, it's not by just being\n\n26:41.080 --> 26:45.040\n more intelligent, it's just by doing something else,\n\n26:45.040 --> 26:48.720\n but eventually it's just, it's capitalizing on our mistakes.\n\n26:48.720 --> 26:51.760\n When you look at the chess machines ratings today,\n\n26:51.760 --> 26:54.280\n and compare this to Magnus Carlsen,\n\n26:54.280 --> 26:57.160\n it's the same as comparing Ferrari to Usain Bolt.\n\n26:57.160 --> 27:01.160\n It's the, the gap is, I mean, by chess standards,\n\n27:01.160 --> 27:06.160\n is insane, 34, 3500 to 2800, 2850 on Magnus.\n\n27:06.400 --> 27:09.880\n It's like difference between Magnus and an ordinary player\n\n27:09.880 --> 27:11.800\n from an open international tournament.\n\n27:13.560 --> 27:15.200\n It's not because machine understanding\n\n27:15.200 --> 27:17.040\n is better than Magnus Carlsen,\n\n27:17.040 --> 27:19.320\n but simply because it's steady.\n\n27:19.320 --> 27:21.480\n Machine has steady hand.\n\n27:21.480 --> 27:24.920\n And I think that is what we, we, we,\n\n27:24.920 --> 27:28.920\n we have to learn from 1997 experience,\n\n27:28.920 --> 27:31.680\n and from further encounters with computers,\n\n27:31.680 --> 27:36.120\n and sort of the current state of affairs with AlphaZero,\n\n27:36.120 --> 27:38.320\n beating other machines.\n\n27:38.320 --> 27:41.880\n The idea that we can compete with computers\n\n27:41.880 --> 27:43.680\n in so called intellectual fields,\n\n27:44.800 --> 27:47.400\n it was wrong from the very beginning.\n\n27:47.400 --> 27:50.240\n It's just, it's, by the way, the 1997 match\n\n27:50.240 --> 27:54.680\n was not the first victory of machines over AlphaZero.\n\n27:54.680 --> 27:56.680\n Or grandmasters.\n\n27:56.680 --> 27:57.640\n Or grandmasters.\n\n27:57.640 --> 28:00.720\n No, actually it's, I played against\n\n28:00.720 --> 28:04.120\n first decent chess computers from late, from late 80s.\n\n28:04.120 --> 28:07.200\n So I played with the prototype of Deep Blue\n\n28:07.200 --> 28:09.280\n called Deep Thought in 1989,\n\n28:09.280 --> 28:10.600\n two rapid chess games in New York,\n\n28:10.600 --> 28:13.120\n I won handily to both games.\n\n28:13.120 --> 28:17.240\n We played against new chess engines like Fritz,\n\n28:17.240 --> 28:18.800\n and other programs.\n\n28:18.800 --> 28:21.320\n And then it's the, it was Israeli program Junior\n\n28:21.320 --> 28:23.240\n that appeared in 1995.\n\n28:23.240 --> 28:25.440\n Yeah, so there were, there were several programs.\n\n28:25.440 --> 28:28.240\n I, you know, I lost few games in Blitz.\n\n28:28.240 --> 28:31.160\n I lost one match against the computer chess engine\n\n28:31.160 --> 28:33.120\n 1994 rapid chess.\n\n28:33.120 --> 28:36.120\n So I lost one game to Deep Blue in 1996 match,\n\n28:36.120 --> 28:38.160\n the man, the match I won.\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:40.000\n Some people, you know, tend to forget about it\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:41.360\n that I won the first match.\n\n28:41.360 --> 28:42.280\n Yes.\n\n28:42.280 --> 28:44.520\n But it's, it's, we,\n\n28:45.520 --> 28:48.280\n we made a very important psychological mistake\n\n28:48.280 --> 28:51.120\n thinking that the reason we lost Blitz matches,\n\n28:51.120 --> 28:52.440\n five, five minutes games.\n\n28:52.440 --> 28:55.440\n The reason we lost some of the rapid chess matches,\n\n28:55.440 --> 28:56.560\n 25 minutes chess.\n\n28:56.560 --> 28:58.200\n Because we didn't have enough time.\n\n28:58.200 --> 29:00.040\n If you play a longer match,\n\n29:00.040 --> 29:02.080\n we will not make the same mistakes.\n\n29:02.080 --> 29:02.960\n Nonsense.\n\n29:02.960 --> 29:05.120\n So this, yeah, we had more time,\n\n29:05.120 --> 29:06.160\n but we still make mistakes.\n\n29:06.160 --> 29:07.600\n And machine also has more time.\n\n29:07.600 --> 29:10.120\n And machines, machine will always, you know,\n\n29:10.120 --> 29:13.080\n will always be steady and consistent\n\n29:13.080 --> 29:18.080\n compared to humans instabilities and inconsistencies.\n\n29:18.120 --> 29:20.800\n And today we are at the point where yes,\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:23.320\n nobody talks about, you know,\n\n29:23.320 --> 29:24.560\n humans playing as machines.\n\n29:24.560 --> 29:27.600\n Now machines can offer handicap to top players\n\n29:27.600 --> 29:31.280\n and still, you know, will, will, will be favored.\n\n29:31.280 --> 29:33.320\n I think we're just learning that it's, it's,\n\n29:33.320 --> 29:35.400\n it's no longer human versus machines.\n\n29:35.400 --> 29:37.880\n It's about human working with machines.\n\n29:37.880 --> 29:41.760\n That's what I recognized in 1998,\n\n29:41.760 --> 29:44.000\n just after leaking my wounds and spending one year\n\n29:44.000 --> 29:46.080\n in just, you know, ruminating so the,\n\n29:46.080 --> 29:48.400\n so what's happened in this match.\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:50.840\n And I knew that though we still could play\n\n29:50.840 --> 29:51.680\n against the machines.\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:53.960\n I had two more matches in, in 2003,\n\n29:53.960 --> 29:56.640\n playing both Deep Fritz and Deep Junior.\n\n29:56.640 --> 29:58.560\n Both matches ended as a tie.\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:01.920\n Though these machines were not weaker,\n\n30:01.920 --> 30:05.000\n at least actually probably stronger than Deep Blue.\n\n30:05.000 --> 30:08.800\n And by the way, today chess app on your mobile phone\n\n30:08.800 --> 30:10.520\n is probably stronger than Deep Blue.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:12.440\n I'm not speaking about chess engines\n\n30:12.440 --> 30:13.920\n that are so much superior.\n\n30:13.920 --> 30:16.360\n And by the way, when you analyze games\n\n30:16.360 --> 30:19.240\n we played against Deep Blue in 1997 on your chess engine,\n\n30:19.240 --> 30:20.600\n they'll be laughing.\n\n30:20.600 --> 30:23.240\n So this is, and it's also shows that's how chess changed\n\n30:23.240 --> 30:26.760\n because chess commentators, they look at some of our games\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:29.360\n like game four, game five, brilliant idea.\n\n30:29.360 --> 30:34.360\n Now you ask Stockfish, you ask Houdini,\n\n30:35.200 --> 30:37.600\n you ask Commodore, all the leading chess engines.\n\n30:37.600 --> 30:40.160\n Within 30 seconds, they will show you how many mistakes\n\n30:40.160 --> 30:43.880\n both Gary and Deep Blue made in the game\n\n30:43.880 --> 30:48.880\n that was trumpeted as the, as a great chess match in 1997.\n\n30:50.920 --> 30:51.760\n Well, okay.\n\n30:51.760 --> 30:54.000\n So you've made an interesting,\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:56.400\n if you can untangle that comment.\n\n30:56.400 --> 31:01.040\n So now in retrospect, it was a mistake to see chess\n\n31:01.040 --> 31:03.520\n as the peak of human intellect.\n\n31:03.520 --> 31:06.640\n Nevertheless, that was done for centuries.\n\n31:06.640 --> 31:10.320\n So by the way, in Europe, because you know,\n\n31:10.320 --> 31:13.240\n you move to the far East, they will go,\n\n31:13.240 --> 31:14.600\n they had show games.\n\n31:14.600 --> 31:15.440\n But games, games.\n\n31:15.440 --> 31:20.040\n Again, some of the games like, you know, board games.\n\n31:20.040 --> 31:20.880\n Yes.\n\n31:20.880 --> 31:22.000\n Yeah, I agree.\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:26.400\n So if I push back a little bit, so now you say that,\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:29.200\n okay, but it was a mistake to see chess as the epitome\n\n31:29.200 --> 31:32.280\n and now, and then now there's other things maybe\n\n31:32.280 --> 31:34.880\n like language, that conversation,\n\n31:34.880 --> 31:36.840\n like some of the things that in your view\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:40.840\n is still way out of reach of computers, but inside humans.\n\n31:40.840 --> 31:44.320\n Do you think, can you talk about what those things might be?\n\n31:44.320 --> 31:47.680\n And do you think just like chess, they might fall?\n\n31:48.880 --> 31:51.000\n Soon with the same set of approaches,\n\n31:51.000 --> 31:52.920\n if you look at AlphaZero,\n\n31:52.920 --> 31:55.240\n the same kind of learning approaches\n\n31:55.240 --> 31:57.400\n as the machines grow in size.\n\n31:57.400 --> 31:59.280\n No, no, it's not about growing in size.\n\n31:59.280 --> 32:02.360\n It's about, again, it's about understanding the difference\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:05.240\n between closed system and open ended system.\n\n32:05.240 --> 32:06.880\n So you think that key difference,\n\n32:06.880 --> 32:11.000\n so the board games are closed in terms of the rule set,\n\n32:11.000 --> 32:15.920\n the actions, the state space, everything is just constrained.\n\n32:15.920 --> 32:19.800\n You think once you open it, the machines are lost?\n\n32:19.800 --> 32:22.920\n Not lost, but again, the effectiveness is very different\n\n32:22.920 --> 32:25.600\n because machine does not understand the moment\n\n32:25.600 --> 32:28.520\n it's reaching territory of diminishing returns.\n\n32:28.520 --> 32:32.480\n It's the, to put it in a different way,\n\n32:32.480 --> 32:35.880\n machine doesn't know how to ask right questions.\n\n32:35.880 --> 32:38.200\n It can ask questions, but it will never tell you\n\n32:38.200 --> 32:39.440\n which questions are relevant.\n\n32:39.440 --> 32:41.200\n So there's the, it's like about the, it's the,\n\n32:41.200 --> 32:42.360\n it's a direction.\n\n32:42.360 --> 32:45.080\n So these, it's, I think it's in human machine relations,\n\n32:45.080 --> 32:48.320\n we have to consider, so our role and people,\n\n32:48.320 --> 32:50.280\n many people feel uncomfortable that this,\n\n32:50.280 --> 32:54.320\n the territory that belongs to us is shrinking.\n\n32:55.800 --> 32:57.640\n I'm saying, so what, you know, this is,\n\n32:57.640 --> 33:00.720\n eventually we'll belong to the last few decimal points,\n\n33:00.720 --> 33:05.480\n but it's like having, so a very powerful gun,\n\n33:05.480 --> 33:09.840\n that's, and all you can do there is slightly,\n\n33:09.840 --> 33:11.640\n you know, alter direction of the bullet.\n\n33:11.640 --> 33:16.160\n Maybe, you know, 0.1 degree of this angle,\n\n33:16.160 --> 33:21.080\n but that means a mile away, 10 meters of target.\n\n33:21.080 --> 33:25.120\n So that's, we have to recognize that is a certain\n\n33:25.120 --> 33:30.120\n unique human qualities that machines in a foreseeable future\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:33.000\n will not be able to reproduce.\n\n33:33.000 --> 33:35.880\n And the effectiveness of this cooperation,\n\n33:35.880 --> 33:38.280\n collaboration depends on our understanding\n\n33:38.280 --> 33:40.400\n what exactly we can bring into the game.\n\n33:40.400 --> 33:43.840\n So the greatest danger is when we try to interfere\n\n33:43.840 --> 33:45.600\n with machine superior knowledge.\n\n33:45.600 --> 33:48.560\n So that's why I always say that sometimes you'd rather have,\n\n33:48.560 --> 33:51.640\n by reading these pictures in radiology,\n\n33:51.640 --> 33:55.440\n you may probably prefer an experienced nurse\n\n33:55.440 --> 33:57.640\n than rather than having top professor,\n\n33:57.640 --> 34:00.600\n because she will not try to interfere\n\n34:00.600 --> 34:02.200\n with machines understanding.\n\n34:02.200 --> 34:05.000\n So it's very important to know that if machines knows\n\n34:05.000 --> 34:09.000\n how to do better things in 95%, 96% of territory,\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.360\n we should not touch it because it's happened.\n\n34:11.360 --> 34:15.400\n It's like in chess, recognize they do it better.\n\n34:15.400 --> 34:17.160\n See where we can make the difference.\n\n34:17.160 --> 34:20.320\n You mentioned AlphaZero, I mean, AlphaZero is,\n\n34:20.320 --> 34:24.200\n it's actually a first step into what you may call AI,\n\n34:24.200 --> 34:26.800\n because everything that's being called AI today,\n\n34:26.800 --> 34:30.840\n it's just, it's one or another variation\n\n34:30.840 --> 34:34.000\n of what Claude Shannon characterized as a brute force.\n\n34:34.000 --> 34:36.680\n It's a type A machine, whether it's Deep Blue,\n\n34:36.680 --> 34:41.480\n whether it's Watson, and all these modern technologies\n\n34:41.480 --> 34:45.320\n that are being trumpeted as AI, it's still brute force.\n\n34:45.320 --> 34:48.760\n It's the, all they do, it's they do optimization.\n\n34:48.760 --> 34:52.560\n It's this, they are, you know, they keep, you know,\n\n34:52.560 --> 34:56.920\n improving the way to process human generated data.\n\n34:56.920 --> 35:01.920\n Now, AlphaZero is the first step towards, you know,\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.840\n machine produced knowledge.\n\n35:04.840 --> 35:06.880\n Which is, by the way, it's quite ironic\n\n35:06.880 --> 35:10.400\n that the first company that championed that was IBM.\n\n35:12.040 --> 35:13.560\n Oh, it's in backgammon.\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:15.400\n Interesting, in backgammon.\n\n35:15.400 --> 35:19.640\n Yes, you should look at IBM, it's a newer gammon.\n\n35:19.640 --> 35:22.040\n It's the scientist called Cesaro.\n\n35:22.040 --> 35:23.520\n He's still working at IBM.\n\n35:23.520 --> 35:25.520\n They had it in the early 90s.\n\n35:25.520 --> 35:29.360\n It's the program that played, you know, the AlphaZero type,\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:31.720\n so just trying to come up with own strategies.\n\n35:31.720 --> 35:34.360\n But because of success of Deep Blue,\n\n35:34.360 --> 35:36.720\n this project had been not abandoned,\n\n35:36.720 --> 35:40.000\n but just, you know, it was put on hold.\n\n35:40.000 --> 35:42.520\n And now we just, you know, it's, you know,\n\n35:42.520 --> 35:44.520\n everybody talks about this,\n\n35:44.520 --> 35:48.480\n the machines generated knowledge, so as revolutionary.\n\n35:48.480 --> 35:51.400\n And it is, but there's still, you know,\n\n35:51.400 --> 35:54.120\n many open ended questions.\n\n35:54.120 --> 35:58.160\n Yes, AlphaZero generates its own data.\n\n35:58.160 --> 36:00.800\n Many ideas that AlphaZero generated in chess\n\n36:00.800 --> 36:02.200\n were quite intriguing.\n\n36:02.200 --> 36:04.640\n So I looked at these games with,\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:08.160\n not just with interest, but with, you know,\n\n36:08.160 --> 36:11.360\n it was quite exciting to learn how machine\n\n36:11.360 --> 36:13.880\n could actually, you know, juggle all the pieces\n\n36:13.880 --> 36:17.400\n and just play positions with a broken material balance,\n\n36:17.400 --> 36:20.480\n sacrificing material, always being ahead of other programs,\n\n36:20.480 --> 36:22.040\n you know, one or two moves ahead\n\n36:22.040 --> 36:24.840\n by foreseeing the consequences,\n\n36:24.840 --> 36:27.440\n not overcalculating because machines,\n\n36:27.440 --> 36:30.280\n other machines were at least as powerful in calculating,\n\n36:30.280 --> 36:33.200\n but it's having this unique knowledge\n\n36:33.200 --> 36:37.240\n based on discovered patterns after playing 60 million games.\n\n36:37.240 --> 36:39.680\n Almost something that feels like intuition.\n\n36:39.680 --> 36:41.400\n Exactly, but there's one problem.\n\n36:41.400 --> 36:42.240\n Yeah.\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:44.800\n Now, the simple question,\n\n36:44.800 --> 36:47.640\n if AlphaZero faces superior point,\n\n36:47.640 --> 36:52.640\n let's say another powerful computer accompanied by a human\n\n36:53.760 --> 36:56.240\n who could help just to discover certain problems,\n\n36:56.240 --> 36:58.720\n because I already, I look at many AlphaZero games.\n\n36:58.720 --> 37:00.280\n I visited their lab, you know,\n\n37:00.280 --> 37:01.840\n spoke to Demis Hassabis and his team,\n\n37:01.840 --> 37:04.200\n and I know there's certain weaknesses there.\n\n37:04.200 --> 37:05.680\n Now, if these weaknesses are exposed,\n\n37:05.680 --> 37:07.680\n the question is how many games will it take\n\n37:07.680 --> 37:09.560\n for AlphaZero to correct it?\n\n37:09.560 --> 37:11.560\n The answer is hundreds of thousands.\n\n37:11.560 --> 37:13.320\n Even if it keeps losing, it can,\n\n37:13.320 --> 37:16.400\n it's just because the whole system is based.\n\n37:16.400 --> 37:19.160\n So it's now, imagine so this is,\n\n37:19.160 --> 37:21.680\n you can have a human by just making a few tweaks.\n\n37:21.680 --> 37:24.520\n So humans are still more flexible.\n\n37:24.520 --> 37:28.360\n And as long as we recognize what is our role,\n\n37:28.360 --> 37:30.720\n where we can play sort of,\n\n37:30.720 --> 37:34.280\n so the most valuable part in this collaboration.\n\n37:34.280 --> 37:36.960\n So it's, it will help us to understand\n\n37:36.960 --> 37:40.440\n what are the next steps in human machine collaboration.\n\n37:40.440 --> 37:41.280\n Beautifully put.\n\n37:41.280 --> 37:43.240\n So let's talk about the thing that machines\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:46.120\n certainly don't know how to do yet, which is morality.\n\n37:46.120 --> 37:47.480\n Machines and morality.\n\n37:47.480 --> 37:48.760\n It's another question that, you know,\n\n37:48.760 --> 37:51.560\n just it's being asked all the time these days.\n\n37:51.560 --> 37:54.280\n And I think it's another phantom\n\n37:54.280 --> 37:57.320\n that is haunting a general public\n\n37:57.320 --> 37:59.280\n because it's just being fed with this,\n\n37:59.280 --> 38:03.600\n you know, illusions is that how can we avoid machines,\n\n38:03.600 --> 38:07.640\n you know, having bias, being prejudiced?\n\n38:07.640 --> 38:10.480\n You cannot, because it's like looking in the mirror\n\n38:10.480 --> 38:12.080\n and complaining about what you see.\n\n38:12.080 --> 38:14.760\n If you have certain bias in the society,\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:17.440\n machine will just follow it.\n\n38:17.440 --> 38:19.760\n It's just, it's, you know, you look at the mirror,\n\n38:19.760 --> 38:20.960\n you don't like what you see there.\n\n38:20.960 --> 38:23.680\n You can, you know, you can break it.\n\n38:23.680 --> 38:25.480\n You can try to distort it.\n\n38:25.480 --> 38:27.960\n Or you can try to actually change something.\n\n38:27.960 --> 38:29.400\n Just by yourself.\n\n38:29.400 --> 38:30.360\n By yourself, yes.\n\n38:30.360 --> 38:31.880\n So it's very important to understand\n\n38:31.880 --> 38:33.640\n is that you cannot expect machines\n\n38:33.640 --> 38:37.280\n to improve the ills of our society.\n\n38:37.280 --> 38:39.680\n And moreover machines will simply, you know,\n\n38:39.680 --> 38:41.240\n just, you know, amplify it.\n\n38:41.240 --> 38:42.120\n Yes. Yeah.\n\n38:42.120 --> 38:45.600\n But the thing is people are more comfortable\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:50.600\n with other people doing injustice, with being biased.\n\n38:50.600 --> 38:52.440\n We're not comfortable with machines\n\n38:52.440 --> 38:54.280\n having the same kind of bias.\n\n38:54.280 --> 38:58.040\n So that's an interesting standard\n\n38:58.040 --> 38:59.320\n that we place on machines.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:01.960\n With autonomous vehicles, they have to be much safer.\n\n39:01.960 --> 39:04.080\n With automated systems.\n\n39:04.080 --> 39:05.200\n Of course they're much safer.\n\n39:05.200 --> 39:07.120\n Statistically, they're much safer than.\n\n39:07.120 --> 39:08.560\n It's not of course.\n\n39:08.560 --> 39:10.720\n Why would, it's not of course.\n\n39:10.720 --> 39:12.680\n It's not given.\n\n39:13.720 --> 39:16.400\n Autonomous vehicles, you have to work really hard\n\n39:16.400 --> 39:19.080\n to make them safer.\n\n39:21.160 --> 39:22.760\n I think it just, it goes without saying\n\n39:22.760 --> 39:25.600\n is the outcome of this,\n\n39:25.600 --> 39:29.040\n I would call it competition with comparison is very clear.\n\n39:29.040 --> 39:32.320\n But the problem is not about being, you know, safer.\n\n39:32.320 --> 39:36.200\n It's the 40,000 people or so every year died\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:38.280\n in car accidents in the United States.\n\n39:38.280 --> 39:40.120\n And it's statistics.\n\n39:40.120 --> 39:42.680\n One accident with autonomous vehicle\n\n39:42.680 --> 39:43.920\n and it's front page of a newspaper.\n\n39:43.920 --> 39:44.760\n Yes.\n\n39:44.760 --> 39:47.240\n So it's, again, it's about psychology.\n\n39:47.240 --> 39:49.400\n So it's while people, you know,\n\n39:49.400 --> 39:50.600\n kill each other in car accidents\n\n39:50.600 --> 39:52.680\n because they make mistakes, they make more mistakes.\n\n39:52.680 --> 39:54.400\n For me, it's not a question.\n\n39:54.400 --> 39:57.040\n Of course we make more mistakes because we're human.\n\n39:57.040 --> 39:58.520\n Yes, machines are old.\n\n39:58.520 --> 40:01.360\n And by the way, no machine will ever reach 100% perfection.\n\n40:01.360 --> 40:04.000\n That's another important fake story\n\n40:04.000 --> 40:05.840\n that is being fed to the public.\n\n40:05.840 --> 40:09.040\n If machine doesn't reach 100% performance, it's not safe.\n\n40:09.040 --> 40:11.640\n No, all you can ask any computer,\n\n40:11.640 --> 40:13.560\n whether it's, you know, playing chess\n\n40:13.560 --> 40:16.280\n or doing the stock market calculations\n\n40:16.280 --> 40:18.640\n or driving your autonomous vehicle,\n\n40:18.640 --> 40:21.200\n it's to make fewer mistakes.\n\n40:21.200 --> 40:23.160\n And yes, I know it's not, you know,\n\n40:23.160 --> 40:25.600\n it's not easy for us to accept because ah,\n\n40:25.600 --> 40:28.200\n if, you know, if you have two humans, you know,\n\n40:28.200 --> 40:31.280\n colliding in their cars, okay, it's like,\n\n40:31.280 --> 40:34.120\n if one of these cars is autonomous vehicle,\n\n40:34.120 --> 40:37.320\n and by the way, even if it's humans fault, terrible.\n\n40:37.320 --> 40:40.560\n How could you allow a machine to run\n\n40:40.560 --> 40:42.600\n without a driver at the wheel?\n\n40:42.600 --> 40:45.160\n So, you know, let's linger that for a second,\n\n40:45.160 --> 40:48.040\n that double standard, the way you felt\n\n40:48.040 --> 40:51.560\n with your first loss against Deep Blue,\n\n40:51.560 --> 40:54.400\n were you treating the machine differently\n\n40:54.400 --> 40:56.560\n than you would have a human?\n\n40:56.560 --> 40:58.640\n Or, so what do you think about that difference\n\n40:58.640 --> 41:02.120\n between the way we see machines and humans?\n\n41:02.120 --> 41:04.240\n No, it's the, at that time, you know, for me it was a match.\n\n41:04.240 --> 41:06.480\n And that's why I was angry because I believed that\n\n41:06.480 --> 41:08.840\n the match was not, you know, fairly organized.\n\n41:08.840 --> 41:12.960\n So it's, definitely there were unfair advantages for IBM\n\n41:12.960 --> 41:16.840\n and I wanted to play another match, like a rubber match.\n\n41:16.840 --> 41:20.600\n So your anger or displeasure was aimed more like\n\n41:20.600 --> 41:24.520\n at the humans behind IBM versus the actual pure algorithm.\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:26.760\n Absolutely, look, I knew at the time,\n\n41:26.760 --> 41:29.040\n and by the way, I was, objectively speaking,\n\n41:29.040 --> 41:30.280\n I was stronger at that time.\n\n41:30.280 --> 41:32.480\n So that probably added to my anger\n\n41:32.480 --> 41:34.000\n because I knew I could beat the machine.\n\n41:34.000 --> 41:35.560\n Yeah. Yeah, so that's, and that's the,\n\n41:35.560 --> 41:38.040\n and as I lost, and I knew I was not well prepared.\n\n41:38.040 --> 41:39.920\n So because they, I have to give them credit.\n\n41:39.920 --> 41:43.560\n They did some good work from 1996 and I,\n\n41:43.560 --> 41:45.240\n but I still could beat the machine.\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:47.000\n So I made too many mistakes.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:48.440\n Also, this is the whole, it's this,\n\n41:48.440 --> 41:49.800\n the publicity around the match.\n\n41:49.800 --> 41:53.160\n So I underestimated the effect, you know, just it's,\n\n41:53.160 --> 41:56.680\n and being called the, you know, the brain's last stand,\n\n41:56.680 --> 41:59.280\n you know, okay, no pressure.\n\n42:02.160 --> 42:04.000\n Okay, well, let me ask.\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:06.840\n So I was born also in the Soviet Union.\n\n42:06.840 --> 42:09.240\n What lessons do you draw from the rise and fall\n\n42:09.240 --> 42:11.440\n of the Soviet Union in the 20th century?\n\n42:11.440 --> 42:15.240\n When you just look at this nation\n\n42:15.240 --> 42:19.440\n that is now pushing forward into what Russia is,\n\n42:19.440 --> 42:22.920\n if you look at the long arc of history of the 20th century,\n\n42:22.920 --> 42:25.440\n what do we take away?\n\n42:27.000 --> 42:28.800\n What do we take away from that?\n\n42:28.800 --> 42:35.320\n I think the lesson of history is clear.\n\n42:35.320 --> 42:38.560\n Undemocratic systems, totalitarian regimes,\n\n42:38.560 --> 42:42.800\n systems that are based on controlling their citizens\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:46.000\n and just every aspect of their life,\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:52.640\n not offering opportunities to, for private initiative,\n\n42:52.640 --> 42:55.080\n central planning systems, they're doomed.\n\n42:55.080 --> 42:59.480\n They just, you know, they cannot be driving force\n\n42:59.480 --> 43:02.560\n for innovation, so they, in the history timeline,\n\n43:02.560 --> 43:06.200\n I mean, they could cause certain, you know,\n\n43:06.200 --> 43:11.360\n distortion of the concept of progress.\n\n43:11.360 --> 43:13.200\n They, by the way, they may call themselves progressive,\n\n43:13.200 --> 43:17.240\n but we know that the damage that they caused to humanity\n\n43:17.240 --> 43:19.760\n is just, it's yet to be measured.\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:22.200\n But at the end of the day, they fail.\n\n43:22.200 --> 43:26.640\n They fail, and the end of the Cold War was a great triumph\n\n43:26.640 --> 43:28.320\n of the free world.\n\n43:28.320 --> 43:30.080\n It's not that the free world is perfect.\n\n43:30.080 --> 43:32.840\n It's very important to recognize the fact that,\n\n43:32.840 --> 43:34.280\n I always like to mention, you know,\n\n43:34.280 --> 43:36.560\n one of my favorite books, The Lord of the Rings,\n\n43:36.560 --> 43:42.080\n that there's no absolute good, but there is an absolute evil.\n\n43:42.080 --> 43:43.960\n Good, you know, comes in many forms,\n\n43:43.960 --> 43:47.200\n but we all, you know, it's being humans\n\n43:47.200 --> 43:49.640\n or being even, you know, humans from fairy tales\n\n43:49.640 --> 43:52.160\n or just some sort of mythical creatures.\n\n43:52.160 --> 43:57.160\n It's the, you can always find spots on the songs.\n\n43:57.480 --> 44:01.280\n So this is conducting war and just,\n\n44:01.280 --> 44:03.280\n and fighting for justice.\n\n44:03.280 --> 44:04.800\n There are always things that, you know,\n\n44:04.800 --> 44:06.440\n can be easily criticized.\n\n44:06.440 --> 44:08.120\n And human history is the,\n\n44:08.120 --> 44:11.000\n is a never ending quest for perfection.\n\n44:11.000 --> 44:13.200\n But we know that there is absolute evil.\n\n44:13.200 --> 44:16.120\n We know it's, for me, it's no clear, it's, I mean,\n\n44:16.120 --> 44:18.680\n nobody argues about Hitler being absolute evil,\n\n44:18.680 --> 44:19.840\n but I think it's very important to recognize\n\n44:19.840 --> 44:21.240\n Stalin was absolute evil.\n\n44:21.240 --> 44:23.280\n Communism caused more damage\n\n44:23.280 --> 44:26.360\n than any other ideology in the 20th century.\n\n44:26.360 --> 44:28.400\n And unfortunately, while we all know\n\n44:28.400 --> 44:30.400\n that fascism was condemned,\n\n44:30.400 --> 44:32.160\n but there was no Nuremberg for communism.\n\n44:32.160 --> 44:33.600\n And that's why we could see, you know,\n\n44:33.600 --> 44:36.840\n still the successors of Stalin\n\n44:36.840 --> 44:39.080\n are feeling far more comfortable.\n\n44:39.080 --> 44:40.880\n And Putin is one of them.\n\n44:40.880 --> 44:43.280\n You highlight a few interesting connections actually\n\n44:43.280 --> 44:45.040\n between Stalin and Hitler.\n\n44:45.040 --> 44:49.520\n I mean, in terms of the adjusting\n\n44:49.520 --> 44:53.240\n or clarifying the history of World War II,\n\n44:53.240 --> 44:54.080\n which is very interesting.\n\n44:54.080 --> 44:55.320\n Of course, we don't have time.\n\n44:55.320 --> 44:56.160\n So let me ask.\n\n44:56.160 --> 44:57.000\n You can ask, you know,\n\n44:57.000 --> 44:59.960\n I just recently delivered a speech in Toronto\n\n44:59.960 --> 45:02.400\n at 80th anniversary of Molotov Ribbentrop Pact.\n\n45:02.400 --> 45:03.880\n It's something that I believe, you know,\n\n45:03.880 --> 45:07.040\n just, you know, has, must be taught in the schools\n\n45:07.040 --> 45:11.560\n that the World War II had been started by two dictators\n\n45:11.560 --> 45:15.440\n by signing these criminal treaty,\n\n45:15.440 --> 45:19.160\n collusion of two tyrants in August 1939\n\n45:19.160 --> 45:21.280\n that led to the beginning of the World War II.\n\n45:21.280 --> 45:24.200\n And the fact is that eventually Stalin had no choice\n\n45:24.200 --> 45:27.600\n but to join allies because Hitler attacked him.\n\n45:27.600 --> 45:29.960\n So it just doesn't, you know,\n\n45:29.960 --> 45:33.320\n eliminate the fact that Stalin helped Hitler\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:34.360\n to start World War II.\n\n45:34.360 --> 45:37.840\n And he was one of the beneficiaries at early stage\n\n45:37.840 --> 45:40.480\n by annexing a part of Eastern Europe.\n\n45:40.480 --> 45:42.080\n And as a result of the World War II,\n\n45:42.080 --> 45:44.560\n he annexed almost entire Eastern Europe.\n\n45:44.560 --> 45:46.440\n And for many Eastern European nations,\n\n45:46.440 --> 45:47.760\n the end of the World War II\n\n45:47.760 --> 45:50.520\n was the beginning of communist occupation.\n\n45:50.520 --> 45:55.520\n So Putin, you've talked about as a man who stands\n\n45:56.560 --> 46:00.440\n between Russia and democracy, essentially today.\n\n46:00.440 --> 46:04.280\n You've been a strong opponent and critic of Putin.\n\n46:04.280 --> 46:07.840\n Let me ask again, how much does fear\n\n46:07.840 --> 46:09.320\n enter your mind and heart?\n\n46:09.320 --> 46:12.720\n So in 2007, there's this interesting comment\n\n46:12.720 --> 46:17.720\n from Oleg Kalugin, KGB general.\n\n46:17.960 --> 46:19.840\n He said that I do not talk details.\n\n46:19.840 --> 46:21.880\n People who knew them are all dead now\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:23.800\n because they were vocal.\n\n46:23.800 --> 46:25.000\n I'm quiet.\n\n46:25.000 --> 46:28.480\n There's only one man who's vocal and he may be in trouble.\n\n46:28.480 --> 46:30.680\n World Chess champion Kasparov.\n\n46:30.680 --> 46:33.640\n He has been very outspoken in his attacks on Putin.\n\n46:33.640 --> 46:36.320\n And I believe he's probably next on the list.\n\n46:36.320 --> 46:38.840\n So clearly your life has been\n\n46:38.840 --> 46:40.920\n and perhaps continues to be in danger.\n\n46:40.920 --> 46:45.520\n How do you think about having the views you have,\n\n46:45.520 --> 46:48.280\n the ideas you have, being in opposition as you are\n\n46:49.960 --> 46:53.880\n in this kind of context when your life could be in danger?\n\n46:55.720 --> 46:58.080\n That's the reason I live in New York.\n\n46:58.080 --> 47:00.200\n So it was not my first choice,\n\n47:00.200 --> 47:01.960\n but I knew I had to leave Russia at one point.\n\n47:01.960 --> 47:05.480\n And among other places, New York is the safest.\n\n47:05.480 --> 47:07.040\n Is it safe?\n\n47:07.040 --> 47:07.880\n No.\n\n47:07.880 --> 47:11.280\n It's the, I know what happened,\n\n47:11.280 --> 47:14.720\n what is happening with many of Putin's enemies.\n\n47:14.720 --> 47:18.720\n But at the end of the day, I mean, what can I do?\n\n47:18.720 --> 47:21.600\n I could be very proactive\n\n47:21.600 --> 47:24.560\n by trying to change things I can influence.\n\n47:24.560 --> 47:26.360\n But here are a few facts.\n\n47:26.360 --> 47:30.560\n I cannot stop doing what I've been doing for a long time.\n\n47:30.560 --> 47:32.480\n It's the right thing to do.\n\n47:32.480 --> 47:36.280\n I grew up with my family teaching me\n\n47:36.280 --> 47:38.080\n sort of the wisdom of Soviet dissidents,\n\n47:38.080 --> 47:39.560\n do what you must and so be.\n\n47:41.680 --> 47:44.920\n I could try to be cautious by not traveling\n\n47:44.920 --> 47:49.600\n to certain places where my security could be at risk.\n\n47:49.600 --> 47:51.200\n There are so many invitations to speak\n\n47:51.200 --> 47:52.640\n at different locations in the world.\n\n47:52.640 --> 47:57.440\n And I have to say that many countries are just now\n\n47:57.440 --> 48:00.440\n are not destinations that I can afford to travel.\n\n48:01.320 --> 48:02.680\n My mother still lives in Moscow.\n\n48:02.680 --> 48:04.320\n I meet her a few times a year.\n\n48:04.320 --> 48:07.320\n She was devastated when I had to leave Russia\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:10.560\n because since my father died in 1971,\n\n48:10.560 --> 48:14.080\n so she was 33 and she dedicated her entire life\n\n48:14.080 --> 48:15.640\n to her only son.\n\n48:15.640 --> 48:19.480\n But she recognized in just a year or so\n\n48:19.480 --> 48:22.120\n since I left Russia that it was the only chance\n\n48:22.120 --> 48:25.880\n for me to continue my normal life.\n\n48:25.880 --> 48:29.560\n So just to, I mean, to be relatively safe\n\n48:29.560 --> 48:34.560\n and to do what she taught me to do to make the difference.\n\n48:35.880 --> 48:37.880\n Do you think you will ever return to Russia\n\n48:37.880 --> 48:39.360\n or let me ask a different way?\n\n48:39.360 --> 48:40.200\n When?\n\n48:40.200 --> 48:41.640\n Even sooner than many people think\n\n48:41.640 --> 48:43.080\n because I think Putin's regime\n\n48:43.080 --> 48:46.640\n is facing unsurmountable difficulties.\n\n48:46.640 --> 48:49.400\n And again, I read enough historical books\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:54.400\n to know that dictatorships, they end suddenly.\n\n48:54.400 --> 48:59.400\n It's just on Sunday, dictator feels comfortable.\n\n49:01.120 --> 49:05.960\n He believes he's popular on Monday morning, he's bust.\n\n49:05.960 --> 49:07.120\n The good news and bad news.\n\n49:07.120 --> 49:09.720\n I mean, the bad news is that I don't know\n\n49:09.720 --> 49:13.040\n when and how Putin rule ends.\n\n49:13.040 --> 49:14.840\n The good news, he also doesn't know.\n\n49:14.840 --> 49:19.280\n Okay, well put.\n\n49:19.280 --> 49:24.280\n Let me ask a question that seems to preoccupy\n\n49:24.880 --> 49:28.920\n the American mind from the perspective of Russia.\n\n49:28.920 --> 49:33.920\n One, did Russia interfere in the 2016 U.S. election,\n\n49:33.960 --> 49:37.920\n government sanction and future?\n\n49:37.920 --> 49:41.840\n Two, will Russia interfere in the 2020 U.S. election?\n\n49:42.880 --> 49:45.840\n And what does that interference look like?\n\n49:45.840 --> 49:46.680\n It's very old.\n\n49:46.680 --> 49:48.480\n We had such an intelligent conversation.\n\n49:48.480 --> 49:51.880\n And you are ruining everything\n\n49:51.880 --> 49:53.720\n by asking such a stupid question.\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:58.720\n It's insulting for my intellect.\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:03.480\n Of course they did interfere.\n\n50:03.480 --> 50:05.720\n Of course they did absolutely everything to elect Trump.\n\n50:05.720 --> 50:07.400\n I mean, they said it many times.\n\n50:07.400 --> 50:11.320\n It is just, you know, I met enough KGB colonels in my life\n\n50:11.320 --> 50:12.680\n to tell you that, you know,\n\n50:12.680 --> 50:16.160\n just the way Putin looks at Trump, this is the way.\n\n50:16.160 --> 50:18.600\n Look, and I don't have to hear what he says,\n\n50:18.600 --> 50:20.360\n what Trump says, it just is,\n\n50:20.360 --> 50:23.040\n I don't need to go through congressional investigations.\n\n50:23.040 --> 50:24.800\n The way Putin looks at Trump\n\n50:24.800 --> 50:28.440\n is the way the KGB officers looked at the assets.\n\n50:28.440 --> 50:31.480\n It's just, and following to 2020,\n\n50:31.480 --> 50:33.160\n of course they will do absolutely everything\n\n50:33.160 --> 50:35.160\n to help Trump to survive.\n\n50:35.160 --> 50:37.880\n Because I think the damage that Trump's reelections\n\n50:37.880 --> 50:40.320\n could cause to America and to the free world,\n\n50:40.320 --> 50:42.760\n it's just, it's beyond one's imagination.\n\n50:42.760 --> 50:44.520\n I think basically if Trump is reelected,\n\n50:44.520 --> 50:47.040\n he will ruin NATO, because he's already heading\n\n50:47.040 --> 50:49.400\n in this direction, but now he's just,\n\n50:49.400 --> 50:52.960\n he's still limited by the reelection hurdles.\n\n50:56.920 --> 51:01.480\n If he's still in the office after November, 2020,\n\n51:01.480 --> 51:05.960\n okay, January, 2021, I don't want to think about it.\n\n51:05.960 --> 51:07.320\n My problem is not just Trump,\n\n51:07.320 --> 51:09.520\n because Trump is basically, it's a symptom.\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:11.960\n But the problem is that I don't see,\n\n51:11.960 --> 51:16.240\n it's just, it's the, in American political horizon,\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:19.920\n politicians who could take on Trump\n\n51:22.040 --> 51:25.960\n for all damage that he's doing for the free world.\n\n51:25.960 --> 51:27.400\n Not just things that has happened\n\n51:27.400 --> 51:28.800\n that went wrong in America.\n\n51:28.800 --> 51:30.920\n So there's the, it seems to me that the campaign,\n\n51:30.920 --> 51:32.680\n political campaign on the Democratic side\n\n51:32.680 --> 51:37.680\n is fixed on certain important, but still secondary issues.\n\n51:37.800 --> 51:40.560\n Because when you have the foundation of the republic\n\n51:40.560 --> 51:44.080\n in jeopardy, I mean, you cannot talk about healthcare.\n\n51:44.080 --> 51:45.920\n I mean, I understand how important it is,\n\n51:45.920 --> 51:48.680\n but it's still secondary because the entire framework\n\n51:48.680 --> 51:50.680\n of American political life is at risk.\n\n51:50.680 --> 51:53.320\n And you have Vladimir Putin just,\n\n51:53.320 --> 51:56.160\n it's having, fortunately, free hands\n\n51:56.160 --> 52:00.600\n by attacking America and other free countries.\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:02.440\n And by the way, we have so much evidence\n\n52:02.440 --> 52:04.400\n about Russian interference in Brexit,\n\n52:04.400 --> 52:07.280\n in elections in almost every European country.\n\n52:07.280 --> 52:11.080\n And thinking that they will be shy of attacking America\n\n52:11.080 --> 52:15.520\n in 2020, now with Trump in the office, yeah.\n\n52:15.520 --> 52:19.120\n I think it's, yeah, it definitely diminishes\n\n52:19.120 --> 52:21.360\n the intellectual quality of our conversation.\n\n52:21.360 --> 52:24.800\n I do what I can.\n\n52:24.800 --> 52:26.000\n Last question.\n\n52:26.000 --> 52:28.920\n If you can go back, just look at the entirety of your life,\n\n52:28.920 --> 52:33.400\n you accomplished more than most humans will ever do.\n\n52:33.400 --> 52:35.640\n If you could go back and relive a single moment\n\n52:35.640 --> 52:38.680\n in your life, what would that moment be?\n\n52:43.400 --> 52:46.280\n There are moments in my life when I think\n\n52:46.280 --> 52:50.680\n about what could be done differently, but.\n\n52:52.160 --> 52:56.680\n No, experience happiness and joy and pride.\n\n52:56.680 --> 52:58.520\n Just a touch once again.\n\n52:58.520 --> 53:00.280\n I know, I know, but it's the, it's the,\n\n53:00.280 --> 53:01.760\n I made many mistakes in my life.\n\n53:01.760 --> 53:05.480\n So I just, it's the, I know that at the end of the day,\n\n53:05.480 --> 53:07.520\n it's, I believe in the butterfly effect.\n\n53:07.520 --> 53:11.560\n So it's the, it's the, I knew moments where I could,\n\n53:11.560 --> 53:16.560\n now if I'm there at that point in 89 and 93,\n\n53:16.760 --> 53:20.840\n you pick up a year, I could improve my actions\n\n53:20.840 --> 53:22.400\n by not doing this stupid thing.\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.040\n But then how do you know\n\n53:26.040 --> 53:27.880\n that I will have all other accomplishments?\n\n53:27.880 --> 53:31.640\n I just, I'm, I'm afraid that, you know,\n\n53:31.640 --> 53:34.840\n we just have to just follow this,\n\n53:34.840 --> 53:36.720\n if you may call wisdom before is gump, you know,\n\n53:36.720 --> 53:38.800\n it's the life is this, you know, it's, this is,\n\n53:38.800 --> 53:41.520\n it's a box of, of, of, of chocolate\n\n53:41.520 --> 53:42.760\n and you don't know what's inside,\n\n53:42.760 --> 53:44.600\n but you have to go one by one.\n\n53:44.600 --> 53:47.800\n So it's the, I'm, I'm happy with who I am\n\n53:47.800 --> 53:49.000\n and where I am today.\n\n53:49.000 --> 53:52.920\n And I am very proud, not only with my chess accomplishments,\n\n53:52.920 --> 53:54.880\n but that I made this transition.\n\n53:54.880 --> 53:56.520\n And since I left chess, you know,\n\n53:56.520 --> 54:00.200\n I built my own reputation that had some influence\n\n54:00.200 --> 54:03.240\n on the game of chess, but not, it's not, you know,\n\n54:03.240 --> 54:06.640\n directly derived from, from, from the game.\n\n54:06.640 --> 54:08.160\n I'm grateful for my wife.\n\n54:08.160 --> 54:10.200\n So help me to build this life.\n\n54:10.200 --> 54:11.600\n We actually married in 2005.\n\n54:11.600 --> 54:12.600\n It was my third marriage.\n\n54:12.600 --> 54:14.200\n That's why I said I'd made mistakes in my life.\n\n54:14.200 --> 54:17.200\n But, and by the way, I'm close with two kids\n\n54:17.200 --> 54:18.480\n from my previous marriages.\n\n54:18.480 --> 54:20.240\n So that's, that's the, I'm, you know,\n\n54:20.240 --> 54:23.800\n I managed to sort of to balance my life and,\n\n54:23.800 --> 54:25.120\n and here in, I live in New York.\n\n54:25.120 --> 54:28.040\n So we have our two kids born here in New York.\n\n54:28.040 --> 54:31.640\n It's, it's new life and it's, you know, it's, it's busy.\n\n54:31.640 --> 54:33.760\n Sometimes I wish I could, you know, I could limit\n\n54:33.760 --> 54:37.520\n my engagement in many other things that are still,\n\n54:37.520 --> 54:42.120\n you know, taking time and energy,\n\n54:42.120 --> 54:44.880\n but life is exciting.\n\n54:44.880 --> 54:48.760\n And as long as I can feel that I have energy,\n\n54:48.760 --> 54:53.640\n I have strengths, I have passion to make the difference,\n\n54:54.640 --> 54:55.480\n I'm happy.\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:59.400\n I think that's a beautiful moment to end on.\n\n54:59.400 --> 55:02.520\n Gary, thank you very much for talking today.\n\n55:02.520 --> 55:29.520\n Thank you.\n\n"
