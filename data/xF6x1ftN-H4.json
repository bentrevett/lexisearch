00:07.660\n at times controversial and always brilliant,\n\n00:07.660 --> 00:09.760\n whether you agree with him or not.\n\n00:09.760 --> 00:13.840\n He's an author of 16 books on topics covering\n\n00:13.840 --> 00:18.440\n the history of money, power, war, pandemics, and empire.\n\n00:18.440 --> 00:21.360\n Previously at Harvard, currently at Stanford,\n\n00:21.360 --> 00:25.920\n and today launching a new university here in Austin, Texas\n\n00:25.920 --> 00:28.680\n called the University of Austin,\n\n00:28.680 --> 00:31.840\n a new institution built from the ground up\n\n00:31.840 --> 00:34.520\n to encourage open inquiry and discourse\n\n00:34.520 --> 00:36.240\n by both thinkers and doers,\n\n00:36.240 --> 00:38.120\n from philosophers and historians\n\n00:38.120 --> 00:40.200\n to scientists and engineers,\n\n00:40.200 --> 00:43.900\n embracing debate, dissent, and self examination,\n\n00:43.900 --> 00:46.880\n free to speak, to disagree, to think,\n\n00:46.880 --> 00:49.740\n to explore truly novel ideas.\n\n00:49.740 --> 00:53.120\n The advisory board includes Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt,\n\n00:53.120 --> 00:58.120\n and many other amazing people with one exception, me.\n\n00:58.120 --> 01:01.240\n I was graciously invited to be on the advisory board,\n\n01:01.240 --> 01:04.320\n which I accepted in the hope of doing my small part\n\n01:04.320 --> 01:08.060\n in helping build the future of education and open discourse,\n\n01:08.060 --> 01:10.480\n especially in the fields of artificial intelligence,\n\n01:10.480 --> 01:12.200\n robotics, and computing.\n\n01:12.200 --> 01:14.460\n We spend the first hour of this conversation\n\n01:14.460 --> 01:16.560\n talking about this new university\n\n01:16.560 --> 01:18.880\n before switching to talking about\n\n01:18.880 --> 01:21.080\n some of the darkest moments in human history\n\n01:21.080 --> 01:23.640\n and what they reveal about human nature.\n\n01:24.520 --> 01:26.500\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:26.500 --> 01:28.660\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:28.660 --> 01:29.920\n in the description.\n\n01:29.920 --> 01:33.820\n And now, here's my conversation with Neil Ferguson.\n\n01:35.040 --> 01:37.280\n You are one of the great historians of our time,\n\n01:37.280 --> 01:40.100\n respected, sometimes controversial.\n\n01:40.100 --> 01:42.160\n You have flourished in some of the best universities\n\n01:42.160 --> 01:45.180\n in the world, from NYU to London School of Economics,\n\n01:45.180 --> 01:49.480\n to Harvard, and now to Hoover Institution at Stanford.\n\n01:49.480 --> 01:53.220\n Before we talk about the history of money, war, and power,\n\n01:53.220 --> 01:55.740\n let us talk about a new university.\n\n01:55.740 --> 01:59.720\n You're a part of launching here in Austin, Texas.\n\n01:59.720 --> 02:04.720\n It is called University of Austin, UATX.\n\n02:04.880 --> 02:08.100\n What is its mission, its goals, its plan?\n\n02:09.320 --> 02:13.960\n I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of people\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:17.600\n in higher education that there's a problem.\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:19.480\n And that problem manifests itself\n\n02:19.480 --> 02:22.060\n in a great many different ways.\n\n02:22.060 --> 02:24.240\n But I would sum up the problem\n\n02:24.240 --> 02:29.240\n as being a drastic chilling of the atmosphere\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:34.480\n that constrains free speech, free exchange,\n\n02:34.480 --> 02:35.660\n even free thought.\n\n02:36.680 --> 02:38.440\n And I had never anticipated\n\n02:38.440 --> 02:40.360\n that this would happen in my lifetime.\n\n02:40.360 --> 02:43.080\n My academic career began in Oxford in the 1980s\n\n02:43.080 --> 02:45.520\n when anything went.\n\n02:45.520 --> 02:48.000\n One sensed that a university was a place\n\n02:48.000 --> 02:51.280\n where one could risk saying the unsayable\n\n02:51.280 --> 02:54.320\n and debate the undebatable.\n\n02:54.320 --> 02:58.640\n So the fact that in a relatively short space of time,\n\n02:58.640 --> 03:02.160\n a variety of ideas, critical race theory or wokeism,\n\n03:02.160 --> 03:02.980\n whatever you want to call it,\n\n03:02.980 --> 03:04.880\n a variety of ideas have come along\n\n03:04.880 --> 03:08.040\n that seek to limit and quite drastically limit\n\n03:08.040 --> 03:12.600\n what we can talk about strikes me as deeply unhealthy.\n\n03:12.600 --> 03:14.500\n And I'm not sure, and I've thought about this\n\n03:14.500 --> 03:15.880\n for a long time, you can fix it\n\n03:15.880 --> 03:17.720\n with the existing institutions.\n\n03:18.680 --> 03:20.080\n I think you need to create a new one.\n\n03:20.080 --> 03:22.480\n And so after much deliberation,\n\n03:22.480 --> 03:24.000\n we decided to do it.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:29.000\n And I think it's a hugely timely opportunity\n\n03:29.960 --> 03:33.080\n to do what people used to do in this country,\n\n03:33.080 --> 03:34.640\n which was to create new institutions.\n\n03:34.640 --> 03:37.520\n I mean, that used to be the default setting of America.\n\n03:37.520 --> 03:38.600\n We sort of stopped doing that.\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:39.560\n I mean, I look back and I thought,\n\n03:39.560 --> 03:41.840\n why are there no new universities?\n\n03:41.840 --> 03:42.960\n Or at least if there are,\n\n03:42.960 --> 03:45.080\n why do they have so little impact?\n\n03:45.080 --> 03:48.000\n It seems like we have the billionaires,\n\n03:48.000 --> 03:50.440\n we have the need, let's do it.\n\n03:50.440 --> 03:53.080\n So you still believe in institutions,\n\n03:53.080 --> 03:56.040\n in the university, in the ideal of the university?\n\n03:56.040 --> 03:59.200\n I believe passionately in that ideal.\n\n03:59.200 --> 04:02.780\n There's a reason they've been around for nearly a millennium.\n\n04:02.780 --> 04:07.780\n There is a unique thing that happens\n\n04:08.420 --> 04:11.960\n on a university campus when it's done right.\n\n04:11.960 --> 04:16.580\n And that is the transfer of knowledge between generations.\n\n04:16.580 --> 04:18.320\n That is a very sacred activity.\n\n04:18.320 --> 04:22.840\n And it seems to withstand major changes in technology.\n\n04:22.840 --> 04:25.700\n So this form that we call the university predates\n\n04:25.700 --> 04:29.620\n the printing press, survive the printing press,\n\n04:29.620 --> 04:32.080\n continue to function through the scientific revolution,\n\n04:32.080 --> 04:37.080\n the enlightenment, the industrial revolution to this day.\n\n04:37.320 --> 04:39.320\n And I think it's because,\n\n04:39.320 --> 04:41.580\n maybe because of evolutionary psychology,\n\n04:41.580 --> 04:46.580\n we need to be together in one relatively confined space\n\n04:48.720 --> 04:51.840\n when we're in our late teens and early twenties\n\n04:51.840 --> 04:54.420\n for the knowledge transfer between the generations\n\n04:54.420 --> 04:56.320\n to happen.\n\n04:56.320 --> 04:58.200\n That's my feeling about this,\n\n04:58.200 --> 05:00.720\n but in order for it to work well,\n\n05:00.720 --> 05:03.680\n there needs to be very few constraints.\n\n05:03.680 --> 05:05.720\n There needs to be a sense\n\n05:05.720 --> 05:07.880\n that one can take intellectual risk.\n\n05:07.880 --> 05:10.760\n Remember, people in their late teens and early twenties\n\n05:10.760 --> 05:14.220\n are adults, but they're inexperienced adults.\n\n05:14.220 --> 05:17.720\n And if I look back on my own time as an undergraduate,\n\n05:17.720 --> 05:21.680\n saying stupid things was my MO.\n\n05:21.680 --> 05:24.960\n My way to finding good ideas\n\n05:24.960 --> 05:28.720\n was through a minefield of bad ideas.\n\n05:28.720 --> 05:33.260\n I feel so sorry for people like me today,\n\n05:33.260 --> 05:36.120\n people age 18, 19, 20 today,\n\n05:36.120 --> 05:40.480\n who are intellectually very curious\n\n05:40.480 --> 05:42.960\n ambitious, but inexperienced\n\n05:42.960 --> 05:47.880\n because the minefields today are absolutely lethal.\n\n05:47.880 --> 05:52.080\n And one wrong foot and it's cancellation.\n\n05:52.080 --> 05:54.380\n I said this to Peter Thiel the other day,\n\n05:54.380 --> 05:57.000\n imagine being us now.\n\n05:57.000 --> 06:01.200\n I mean, we were obnoxious undergraduates.\n\n06:01.200 --> 06:03.520\n There's nothing that Peter did at Stanford\n\n06:03.520 --> 06:06.400\n that Andrew Sullivan and I were not doing at Oxford.\n\n06:06.400 --> 06:08.040\n And perhaps we were even worse,\n\n06:08.040 --> 06:11.680\n but it was so not career ending\n\n06:11.680 --> 06:15.540\n to be an absolutely insufferable,\n\n06:17.200 --> 06:21.040\n obnoxious undergraduate then.\n\n06:21.040 --> 06:24.520\n Today, if people like us exist today,\n\n06:24.520 --> 06:28.240\n they must live in a state of constant anxiety\n\n06:28.240 --> 06:32.880\n that they're going to be outed for some heretical statement\n\n06:32.880 --> 06:35.260\n that they made five years ago on social media.\n\n06:35.260 --> 06:37.360\n So part of what motivates me\n\n06:37.360 --> 06:42.360\n is the desire to give the me's of today a shot\n\n06:42.760 --> 06:46.800\n at free thinking and really,\n\n06:46.800 --> 06:51.800\n I'd call it aggressive learning,\n\n06:51.800 --> 06:54.320\n learning where you're really pushed.\n\n06:54.320 --> 06:56.360\n And I just think that stopped happening\n\n06:56.360 --> 06:59.440\n on the major campuses because whether at Harvard\n\n06:59.440 --> 07:02.680\n where I used to teach or at Stanford where I'm now based,\n\n07:02.680 --> 07:07.080\n I sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere of self censorship\n\n07:07.080 --> 07:09.560\n that means people are afraid\n\n07:09.560 --> 07:12.480\n to take even minimal risk in class.\n\n07:12.480 --> 07:14.720\n I mean, just take, for example,\n\n07:14.720 --> 07:17.720\n a survey that was published earlier this year\n\n07:17.720 --> 07:20.360\n that revealed this is of undergraduates\n\n07:20.360 --> 07:22.340\n in four year programs in the US.\n\n07:23.760 --> 07:26.600\n 85% of self described liberal students\n\n07:26.600 --> 07:28.760\n said they would report a professor\n\n07:28.760 --> 07:30.800\n to the university administration\n\n07:30.800 --> 07:33.760\n if he or she said something they considered offensive.\n\n07:33.760 --> 07:36.560\n And something like 75% said they do it\n\n07:36.560 --> 07:38.080\n to a fellow undergraduate.\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:39.700\n That's the kind of culture\n\n07:39.700 --> 07:41.740\n that's evolved in our universities.\n\n07:41.740 --> 07:44.760\n So we need a new university in which none of that is true,\n\n07:44.760 --> 07:48.120\n in which you can speak your mind, say stupid things,\n\n07:48.120 --> 07:52.460\n get it completely wrong and live to tell the tale.\n\n07:52.460 --> 07:54.280\n There's a lot more going on, I think,\n\n07:54.280 --> 07:56.280\n because when you start thinking about\n\n07:56.280 --> 07:58.340\n what's wrong with a modern university,\n\n07:58.340 --> 08:01.800\n many, many more things suggest themselves.\n\n08:01.800 --> 08:03.520\n And I think there's an opportunity here\n\n08:03.520 --> 08:06.980\n to build something that's radically new in some ways\n\n08:06.980 --> 08:10.120\n and radically traditional in other ways.\n\n08:10.120 --> 08:11.880\n For example, I have a strong preference\n\n08:11.880 --> 08:15.400\n for the tutorial system that you see at Oxford and Cambridge,\n\n08:15.400 --> 08:17.760\n which is small group teaching\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:21.320\n and highly Socratic in its structure.\n\n08:21.320 --> 08:23.640\n I think it'd be great to bring that to the United States\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:25.760\n where it doesn't really exist.\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:26.600\n But at the same time,\n\n08:26.600 --> 08:30.880\n I think we should be doing some very 21st century things,\n\n08:30.880 --> 08:33.960\n making sure that while people are reading and studying\n\n08:33.960 --> 08:37.400\n classic works, they're also going to be immersed\n\n08:37.400 --> 08:41.680\n in the real world of technological innovation,\n\n08:41.680 --> 08:43.400\n a world that you know very well.\n\n08:44.280 --> 08:49.280\n And I'd love to get a synthesis of the ancient and classical,\n\n08:49.640 --> 08:52.280\n which we're gradually letting fade away\n\n08:52.280 --> 08:55.520\n with the novel and technological.\n\n08:55.520 --> 08:58.560\n So we wanna produce people who can simultaneously\n\n08:58.560 --> 09:02.560\n talk intelligently about Adam Smith,\n\n09:02.560 --> 09:06.440\n or for that matter, Shakespeare or Proust,\n\n09:06.440 --> 09:11.440\n and have a conversation with you about where AI is going\n\n09:11.560 --> 09:14.920\n and how long it will be before I can get driven here\n\n09:14.920 --> 09:17.040\n by a self driving vehicle,\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:18.800\n allowing me to have my lunch and prepare\n\n09:18.800 --> 09:22.280\n rather than focus on the other crazy people on the road.\n\n09:22.280 --> 09:25.320\n So that's the dream that we can create something\n\n09:25.320 --> 09:29.200\n which is partly classical and partly 21st century.\n\n09:29.200 --> 09:31.120\n And we look around and we don't see it.\n\n09:31.120 --> 09:33.000\n If you don't see an institution\n\n09:33.000 --> 09:35.080\n that you really think should exist,\n\n09:35.080 --> 09:38.080\n I think you have a more responsibility to create it.\n\n09:38.080 --> 09:41.960\n So you're thinking including something bigger\n\n09:41.960 --> 09:43.200\n than just liberal education,\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:46.080\n also including science, engineering and technology.\n\n09:46.080 --> 09:51.080\n I should also comment that I mostly stay out of politics\n\n09:51.080 --> 09:55.680\n and out of some of these aspects of liberal education\n\n09:55.680 --> 09:57.480\n that's kind of been the most controversial\n\n09:57.480 --> 09:59.560\n and difficult within the university.\n\n09:59.560 --> 10:04.480\n But there is a kind of ripple effect of fear\n\n10:04.480 --> 10:08.920\n within that space into science and engineering\n\n10:08.920 --> 10:13.920\n and technology that I think has a nature\n\n10:14.480 --> 10:16.160\n that's difficult to describe.\n\n10:16.160 --> 10:17.680\n It doesn't have a controversial nature.\n\n10:17.680 --> 10:19.360\n It just has a nature of fear\n\n10:19.360 --> 10:22.560\n where you're not, you mentioned saying stupid stuff\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:24.180\n as a young 20 year old.\n\n10:27.200 --> 10:30.080\n For example, deep learning, machine learning\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:32.760\n is really popular in the computer science now\n\n10:32.760 --> 10:36.000\n as an approach for creating artificial intelligence systems.\n\n10:36.000 --> 10:40.000\n It is controversial in that space\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:43.640\n to say that anything against machine learning,\n\n10:43.640 --> 10:46.440\n saying, sort of exploring ideas that saying\n\n10:46.440 --> 10:49.600\n this is going to lead to a dead end.\n\n10:49.600 --> 10:54.120\n Now, that takes some guts to do as a young 20 year old\n\n10:54.120 --> 10:57.320\n within a classroom to think like that,\n\n10:57.320 --> 10:59.720\n to raise that question in a machine learning course.\n\n10:59.720 --> 11:01.360\n It sounds ridiculous because it's like\n\n11:01.360 --> 11:03.800\n who's going to complain about this?\n\n11:03.800 --> 11:08.800\n But the fear that starts in a course on history\n\n11:10.160 --> 11:13.560\n or on some course that covers society,\n\n11:13.560 --> 11:16.920\n the fear ripples and affects those students\n\n11:16.920 --> 11:18.840\n that are asking big out of the box questions\n\n11:18.840 --> 11:22.080\n about engineering, about computer science.\n\n11:22.080 --> 11:24.480\n And there's a lot, there's like linear algebra\n\n11:24.480 --> 11:26.160\n that's not going to change,\n\n11:26.160 --> 11:29.120\n but then there's like applied linear algebra,\n\n11:29.120 --> 11:30.160\n which is machine learning.\n\n11:30.160 --> 11:34.920\n And that's when robots and real systems touch human beings.\n\n11:34.920 --> 11:36.800\n And that's when you have to ask yourself\n\n11:36.800 --> 11:39.960\n these difficult questions about humanity,\n\n11:39.960 --> 11:42.960\n even in the engineering and science and technology courses.\n\n11:42.960 --> 11:46.400\n And these are not separate worlds in two senses.\n\n11:46.400 --> 11:50.040\n I've just taken delivery of my copy of the book\n\n11:50.040 --> 11:53.640\n that Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger have coauthored\n\n11:53.640 --> 11:55.000\n on artificial intelligence,\n\n11:55.000 --> 11:56.600\n the central question of which is,\n\n11:56.600 --> 11:59.640\n what does this mean for us broadly?\n\n11:59.640 --> 12:04.080\n But they're not separate worlds in C.P. Snow's sense\n\n12:04.080 --> 12:07.040\n of the chasm between science and arts,\n\n12:07.040 --> 12:09.800\n because on a university campus,\n\n12:09.800 --> 12:13.640\n everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus\n\n12:13.640 --> 12:16.320\n to the behaviors that are occurring\n\n12:16.320 --> 12:18.360\n in the English department.\n\n12:18.360 --> 12:23.360\n Those behaviors, if denunciation becomes a norm,\n\n12:23.360 --> 12:25.160\n undergraduate denounces professor,\n\n12:25.160 --> 12:27.040\n teaching assistant denounces undergraduate,\n\n12:27.040 --> 12:28.240\n those behaviors are contagious\n\n12:28.240 --> 12:31.000\n and will spread inextricably first to social science\n\n12:31.000 --> 12:32.480\n and then to natural sciences.\n\n12:32.480 --> 12:35.960\n And I think that's part of the reason why\n\n12:35.960 --> 12:37.360\n when this started to happen,\n\n12:37.360 --> 12:40.840\n when we started to get the origins of disinvitation\n\n12:40.840 --> 12:42.360\n and cancel culture,\n\n12:42.360 --> 12:45.480\n it was not just a few conservative professors\n\n12:45.480 --> 12:47.280\n in the humanities who had to worry,\n\n12:47.280 --> 12:48.560\n everybody had to worry,\n\n12:48.560 --> 12:51.600\n because eventually it was going to come\n\n12:51.600 --> 12:56.600\n even to the most apparently hard stem part of the campus.\n\n12:57.680 --> 12:58.880\n It's contagious.\n\n12:58.880 --> 13:00.880\n This is something Nicholas Christakis should look at\n\n13:00.880 --> 13:03.200\n because he's very good at looking at the way\n\n13:03.200 --> 13:06.080\n in which social networks like the ones that exist\n\n13:06.080 --> 13:08.720\n in a university can spread everything.\n\n13:08.720 --> 13:10.560\n But I think when we look back and ask,\n\n13:10.560 --> 13:13.560\n why did wokeism spread so rapidly\n\n13:13.560 --> 13:15.600\n and rapidly out of humanities\n\n13:15.600 --> 13:17.160\n into other parts of universities?\n\n13:17.160 --> 13:19.560\n And why did it spread across the country\n\n13:19.560 --> 13:21.600\n and beyond the United States\n\n13:21.600 --> 13:23.440\n to the other English speaking universities?\n\n13:23.440 --> 13:25.680\n It's because it's a contagion.\n\n13:25.680 --> 13:28.520\n And these behaviors are contagious.\n\n13:28.520 --> 13:32.680\n The president of a university I won't name said to me\n\n13:32.680 --> 13:37.520\n that he receives every day at least one denunciation,\n\n13:37.520 --> 13:40.880\n one call for somebody or other to be fired\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:43.080\n for something that they said.\n\n13:43.080 --> 13:46.880\n That's the crazy kind of totalitarianism light\n\n13:46.880 --> 13:50.600\n that now exists in our universities.\n\n13:50.600 --> 13:52.760\n And of course the people who want to downplay this say,\n\n13:52.760 --> 13:54.760\n oh, well, there only have been a hundred and something\n\n13:54.760 --> 13:56.280\n in disinvitations or,\n\n13:56.280 --> 13:57.920\n oh, there really aren't that many cases.\n\n13:57.920 --> 14:00.400\n But the point is that the famous events,\n\n14:00.400 --> 14:02.520\n the events that get the attention\n\n14:02.520 --> 14:05.040\n are responsible for a general chilling\n\n14:05.040 --> 14:07.880\n that as you say, spreads to every part of the university\n\n14:07.880 --> 14:10.840\n and creates a very familiar culture\n\n14:10.840 --> 14:13.440\n in which people are afraid to say what they think.\n\n14:13.440 --> 14:16.880\n Self censorship, look at the heterodox academy data on this\n\n14:16.880 --> 14:17.880\n grows and grows.\n\n14:17.880 --> 14:20.400\n So now a majority of students will say,\n\n14:20.400 --> 14:23.000\n this is clear from the latest heterodox academy surveys,\n\n14:23.000 --> 14:24.760\n we are scared to say what we think\n\n14:24.760 --> 14:28.560\n in case we get denounced, in case we get canceled.\n\n14:28.560 --> 14:31.320\n But that's just not the correct atmosphere\n\n14:31.320 --> 14:33.960\n for a university in a free society.\n\n14:33.960 --> 14:36.600\n To me, what's really creepy\n\n14:36.600 --> 14:39.120\n is how many of the behaviors I see\n\n14:39.120 --> 14:41.600\n on university campuses today are reminiscent\n\n14:41.600 --> 14:44.720\n of the way that people used to behave in the Soviet Union\n\n14:44.720 --> 14:47.280\n or in the Soviet block or in Maoist China.\n\n14:47.280 --> 14:49.760\n The sort of totalitarianism light\n\n14:49.760 --> 14:52.760\n that I think we're contending with here,\n\n14:52.760 --> 14:56.480\n which manifests itself as denunciations,\n\n14:56.480 --> 14:59.680\n people informing on superiors.\n\n14:59.680 --> 15:02.800\n Some people using it for career advantage.\n\n15:02.800 --> 15:07.080\n Other people reduced to helpless desperate apology\n\n15:07.080 --> 15:09.000\n to try to exonerate themselves.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:12.440\n People disappearing metaphorically, if not literally.\n\n15:12.440 --> 15:16.080\n All of this is so reminiscent of the totalitarian regimes\n\n15:16.080 --> 15:17.760\n that I studied earlier in my career\n\n15:17.760 --> 15:20.120\n that it makes me feel sick.\n\n15:20.120 --> 15:21.480\n And what makes me really feel sick\n\n15:21.480 --> 15:23.680\n is that the people doing this stuff,\n\n15:23.680 --> 15:26.520\n the people who write the letters of denunciation\n\n15:26.520 --> 15:29.280\n are apparently unaware that they're behaving exactly\n\n15:29.280 --> 15:31.200\n like people in Stalin's Soviet Union.\n\n15:31.200 --> 15:32.600\n They don't know that.\n\n15:32.600 --> 15:33.720\n So they clearly have,\n\n15:33.720 --> 15:36.040\n there's been a massive educational failure.\n\n15:36.040 --> 15:37.680\n If somebody can write an anonymous\n\n15:37.680 --> 15:41.200\n or non anonymous letter of denunciation and not feel shame.\n\n15:41.200 --> 15:44.600\n I mean, you should feel morally completely contaminated\n\n15:44.600 --> 15:47.560\n as you're doing that, but people haven't been taught\n\n15:47.560 --> 15:49.760\n the realities of totalitarianism.\n\n15:49.760 --> 15:52.600\n For all these reasons, I think you need to try\n\n15:52.600 --> 15:54.840\n at least to create a new institution\n\n15:54.840 --> 15:59.840\n where those pathologies will be structurally excluded.\n\n16:01.840 --> 16:04.080\n So maybe a difficult question.\n\n16:04.080 --> 16:06.040\n Maybe you'll push back on this,\n\n16:06.040 --> 16:09.160\n but you're widely seen politically as a conservative.\n\n16:09.160 --> 16:12.440\n Hoover Institution is politically conservative.\n\n16:12.440 --> 16:15.920\n What is the role of politics at the University of Austin?\n\n16:15.920 --> 16:18.760\n Because some of the ideas, people listening to this,\n\n16:18.760 --> 16:21.280\n when they hear the ideas you're expressing,\n\n16:21.280 --> 16:23.960\n they may think there's a lean to these ideas.\n\n16:23.960 --> 16:26.200\n There's a conservative lean to these ideas.\n\n16:26.200 --> 16:28.320\n Is there such a lean?\n\n16:28.320 --> 16:30.160\n There will certainly be people who say that\n\n16:30.160 --> 16:34.760\n because the standard mode of trying to discredit\n\n16:34.760 --> 16:36.600\n any new initiative is to say,\n\n16:36.600 --> 16:41.600\n oh, this is a sinister conservative plot.\n\n16:41.840 --> 16:45.600\n But one of our cofounders, Heather Heying,\n\n16:45.600 --> 16:49.160\n is definitely not a conservative.\n\n16:49.160 --> 16:53.280\n She's as committed to the idea of academic freedom as I am.\n\n16:53.280 --> 16:54.680\n But I think on political issues,\n\n16:54.680 --> 16:57.320\n we probably agree on almost nothing.\n\n16:57.320 --> 17:00.240\n And at least I would guess.\n\n17:00.240 --> 17:04.720\n But politics, Max Weber made this point a long time ago,\n\n17:04.720 --> 17:07.320\n that politics really should stop at the threshold\n\n17:07.320 --> 17:09.720\n of the classroom, of the lecture hall.\n\n17:09.720 --> 17:11.920\n And in my career, I've always tried to make sure\n\n17:11.920 --> 17:13.680\n that when I'm teaching,\n\n17:13.680 --> 17:17.960\n it's not clear where I stand politically,\n\n17:17.960 --> 17:19.640\n though of course undergraduates\n\n17:19.640 --> 17:22.120\n insatiably curiously want to know,\n\n17:22.120 --> 17:24.600\n but it shouldn't be clear from what I say\n\n17:24.600 --> 17:28.000\n because indoctrination on a political basis\n\n17:28.000 --> 17:30.840\n is an abuse of the power of the professor,\n\n17:30.840 --> 17:32.920\n as Weber rightly said.\n\n17:32.920 --> 17:35.920\n So I think one of the key principles\n\n17:35.920 --> 17:38.280\n of the University of Austin will be\n\n17:38.280 --> 17:40.640\n that Weberian principle that politics\n\n17:40.640 --> 17:45.040\n is not an appropriate subject\n\n17:45.040 --> 17:48.320\n for the lecture hall, for the classroom.\n\n17:48.320 --> 17:51.400\n And we should pursue truth\n\n17:51.400 --> 17:55.440\n and enshrine liberty of thought.\n\n17:56.560 --> 17:58.720\n If that's a political issue, then I can't help you.\n\n17:58.720 --> 18:01.040\n I mean, if you're against freedom of thought,\n\n18:01.040 --> 18:04.840\n then we don't really have much of a discussion to have.\n\n18:04.840 --> 18:06.000\n And clearly there are some people\n\n18:06.000 --> 18:08.240\n who politically seem quite hostile to it.\n\n18:08.240 --> 18:10.560\n But my sense is that there are plenty\n\n18:10.560 --> 18:12.400\n of people on the left in academia.\n\n18:12.400 --> 18:14.440\n I think of that interesting partnership\n\n18:14.440 --> 18:18.200\n between Cornel West and Robbie George,\n\n18:18.200 --> 18:22.320\n which has been institutionalized in the Academic Freedom Alliance.\n\n18:22.320 --> 18:23.960\n It's bipartisan, this issue.\n\n18:23.960 --> 18:25.320\n It really, really is.\n\n18:25.320 --> 18:28.080\n After all, 50 years ago, it was the left\n\n18:28.080 --> 18:30.400\n that was in favor of free speech.\n\n18:30.400 --> 18:33.880\n The right still has an anti free speech element to it.\n\n18:33.880 --> 18:37.080\n Look how quickly they're out to ban critical race theory.\n\n18:37.080 --> 18:38.480\n Critical race theory won't be banned\n\n18:38.480 --> 18:39.880\n at the University of Texas.\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:41.880\n Wokism won't be banned.\n\n18:41.880 --> 18:44.000\n Everything will be up for discussion,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:46.040\n but the rules of engagement will be clear.\n\n18:46.040 --> 18:49.360\n Chicago principles, those will be enforced.\n\n18:49.360 --> 18:53.520\n And if you have to give a lecture on,\n\n18:53.520 --> 18:56.400\n well, let's just take a recent example,\n\n18:56.400 --> 18:57.800\n the Dorian Abbott case.\n\n18:57.800 --> 19:02.040\n If you're giving a lecture on astrophysics,\n\n19:02.040 --> 19:04.760\n but it turns out that in some different venue\n\n19:04.760 --> 19:08.160\n you express skepticism about affirmative action,\n\n19:08.160 --> 19:09.280\n well, it doesn't matter.\n\n19:09.280 --> 19:10.160\n It's irrelevant.\n\n19:10.160 --> 19:13.040\n We want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics\n\n19:13.040 --> 19:16.120\n cause that's what you're supposed to be giving a lecture on.\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:17.720\n That used to be understood.\n\n19:17.720 --> 19:19.320\n I mean, at the Oxford of the 1980s,\n\n19:19.320 --> 19:22.920\n there were communists and there were ultra Tories.\n\n19:22.920 --> 19:25.800\n At Cambridge, there were people who were so reactionary\n\n19:25.800 --> 19:28.200\n that they celebrated Franco's birthday,\n\n19:28.200 --> 19:30.240\n but they were also out and out communists\n\n19:30.240 --> 19:32.720\n down the road at King's College.\n\n19:32.720 --> 19:36.200\n The understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity\n\n19:36.200 --> 19:38.880\n was part and parcel of university life.\n\n19:38.880 --> 19:40.000\n And frankly, for an undergraduate,\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:42.000\n it was great fun to cross the road\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.320\n and go from outright conservatism,\n\n19:45.320 --> 19:47.680\n ultra Torism to communism.\n\n19:47.680 --> 19:49.120\n One learns a lot that way.\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:52.320\n But the issue is when you're promoting\n\n19:52.320 --> 19:54.840\n or hiring or tenuring people,\n\n19:54.840 --> 19:57.440\n their politics is not relevant.\n\n19:57.440 --> 19:59.040\n It really isn't.\n\n19:59.040 --> 20:01.520\n And when it started to become relevant,\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:03.320\n and I remember this coming up\n\n20:03.320 --> 20:06.800\n at the Harvard history department late in my time there,\n\n20:06.800 --> 20:09.080\n I felt deeply, deeply uneasy\n\n20:09.080 --> 20:11.560\n that we were having conversations\n\n20:11.560 --> 20:15.760\n that amounted to, well, we can't hire X person\n\n20:15.760 --> 20:19.960\n despite their obvious academic qualifications\n\n20:19.960 --> 20:24.120\n because of some political issue.\n\n20:24.120 --> 20:27.520\n That's not what should happen at a healthy university.\n\n20:28.520 --> 20:30.880\n Some practical questions.\n\n20:31.800 --> 20:36.160\n Will University of Austin be a physical in person university\n\n20:36.160 --> 20:38.040\n or virtual university?\n\n20:38.040 --> 20:42.360\n What are some in that aspect where the classroom is?\n\n20:42.360 --> 20:45.720\n It will be a real space institution.\n\n20:46.920 --> 20:50.640\n There may be an online dimension to it\n\n20:50.640 --> 20:52.280\n because there clearly are a lot of things\n\n20:52.280 --> 20:56.360\n that you can do via the internet.\n\n20:56.360 --> 21:00.160\n But the core activity of teaching and learning\n\n21:00.160 --> 21:02.000\n I think requires real space.\n\n21:02.000 --> 21:03.880\n And I've thought about this a long time,\n\n21:03.880 --> 21:07.360\n debated Sebastian Thrun about this many, many years ago\n\n21:07.360 --> 21:09.520\n when he was a complete believer in,\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:12.000\n let's call it the metaversity to go with the metaverse.\n\n21:12.000 --> 21:14.040\n I mean, the metaversity was going to happen, wasn't it?\n\n21:14.040 --> 21:16.920\n But I never really believed in the metaversity.\n\n21:16.920 --> 21:20.000\n I didn't do MOOCs because I just didn't think you'd,\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:22.240\n A, be able to retain the attention,\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:27.040\n B, be able to cope with the scaled grading that was involved.\n\n21:27.040 --> 21:29.920\n I think there's a reason universities have been around\n\n21:29.920 --> 21:32.240\n in their form for about a millennium.\n\n21:32.240 --> 21:34.520\n You kind of need to all be in the same place.\n\n21:34.520 --> 21:36.880\n So I think answer to that question\n\n21:36.880 --> 21:39.960\n definitely a campus in the Austin area.\n\n21:39.960 --> 21:41.760\n That's where we'll start.\n\n21:41.760 --> 21:45.120\n And if we can allow some of our content\n\n21:45.120 --> 21:48.560\n to be available online, great, we'll certainly do that.\n\n21:48.560 --> 21:50.880\n Another question is what kind of courses\n\n21:50.880 --> 21:52.520\n and programming will it offer?\n\n21:52.520 --> 21:54.080\n Is that something you can speak to?\n\n21:54.080 --> 21:55.720\n What's your vision here?\n\n21:55.720 --> 22:00.520\n We think that we need to begin more like a startup\n\n22:00.520 --> 22:05.080\n than like a full service university from day one.\n\n22:05.080 --> 22:08.200\n So our vision is that we start with a summer school,\n\n22:09.320 --> 22:12.480\n which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses.\n\n22:12.480 --> 22:17.480\n We want, I think, to begin by giving a platform\n\n22:18.440 --> 22:21.880\n to the professors who've been most subject\n\n22:21.880 --> 22:23.960\n to council culture and also to give an opportunity\n\n22:23.960 --> 22:25.760\n to students who want to hear them to come.\n\n22:25.760 --> 22:27.160\n So we'll start with a summer school\n\n22:27.160 --> 22:30.040\n that will be somewhat in the tradition\n\n22:30.040 --> 22:33.320\n of those institutions in the interwar period\n\n22:33.320 --> 22:34.840\n that were havens for refugees.\n\n22:34.840 --> 22:37.400\n So we're dealing here with the internal refugees\n\n22:37.400 --> 22:39.800\n of the work era.\n\n22:39.800 --> 22:41.400\n We'll start there.\n\n22:41.400 --> 22:45.520\n It'll be an opportunity to test out some content,\n\n22:45.520 --> 22:50.520\n see what students will come and spend time in Austin to hear.\n\n22:51.240 --> 22:52.520\n So that's part A.\n\n22:52.520 --> 22:56.160\n That's the sort of, if you like, the launch product.\n\n22:56.160 --> 23:00.320\n And then we go straight to a master's program.\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:03.400\n I don't think you can go to undergraduate education\n\n23:03.400 --> 23:06.680\n right away because the established brands\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:09.280\n in undergraduate education are offering something\n\n23:09.280 --> 23:11.040\n it's impossible to compete with initially\n\n23:11.040 --> 23:14.880\n because they have the brand, Harvard, Yale, Stanford,\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:18.000\n and they offer also this peer network,\n\n23:19.040 --> 23:21.720\n which is part of the reason people want so badly\n\n23:21.720 --> 23:24.120\n to go to those places, not really the professors,\n\n23:24.120 --> 23:25.560\n it's the classmates.\n\n23:25.560 --> 23:28.160\n So we don't wanna compete there initially.\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:31.240\n Where there is, I think, room for new entrance\n\n23:31.240 --> 23:35.000\n is in a master's program.\n\n23:35.000 --> 23:37.880\n And the first one will be in entrepreneurship\n\n23:37.880 --> 23:39.520\n and leadership.\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:42.400\n Because I think there's a huge hunger\n\n23:42.400 --> 23:44.160\n amongst people who want to get into,\n\n23:44.160 --> 23:46.040\n particularly the technology world,\n\n23:46.040 --> 23:47.120\n to learn about those things.\n\n23:47.120 --> 23:48.880\n And they know they're not really going to learn\n\n23:48.880 --> 23:50.760\n about them at business schools.\n\n23:50.760 --> 23:53.160\n The people who are not going to teach them leadership\n\n23:53.160 --> 23:55.560\n and entrepreneurship are professors.\n\n23:55.560 --> 23:59.480\n So we want to create something that will be a little like\n\n23:59.480 --> 24:02.680\n the very successful Schwarzman program in China,\n\n24:02.680 --> 24:05.160\n which was come and spend a year in China\n\n24:05.160 --> 24:07.560\n and find out about China.\n\n24:07.560 --> 24:09.520\n We'll be doing the same, essentially saying,\n\n24:09.520 --> 24:12.320\n come and spend a year and find out about technology.\n\n24:12.320 --> 24:15.240\n And there'll be a mix of academic content.\n\n24:15.240 --> 24:18.000\n We want people to understand some of the first principles\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:19.520\n of what they're studying.\n\n24:19.520 --> 24:21.680\n There are first principles of entrepreneurship\n\n24:21.680 --> 24:24.200\n and leadership, but we also want them to spend time with\n\n24:24.200 --> 24:26.440\n people like one of our cofounders, Joe Lonsdale,\n\n24:26.440 --> 24:30.040\n who's been a hugely successful venture capitalist\n\n24:30.040 --> 24:33.240\n and learn directly from people like him.\n\n24:33.240 --> 24:35.800\n So that's the kind of initial offering.\n\n24:35.800 --> 24:37.720\n I think there are other master's programs\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:39.880\n that we will look to roll out quite quickly.\n\n24:39.880 --> 24:42.600\n I have a particular passion for a master's\n\n24:42.600 --> 24:45.520\n in applied history or politics in applied history.\n\n24:45.520 --> 24:48.720\n I'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency\n\n24:48.720 --> 24:51.640\n of academic historians to drift away from\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:53.720\n what seemed to me the important questions\n\n24:53.720 --> 24:56.400\n and certainly to drift away from addressing\n\n24:56.400 --> 24:57.840\n policy relevant questions.\n\n24:57.840 --> 25:01.080\n So I would love to be involved in a master's\n\n25:01.080 --> 25:02.760\n in applied history.\n\n25:02.760 --> 25:06.000\n And we'll build some programs like that\n\n25:06.000 --> 25:11.000\n before we get to the full liberal arts experience\n\n25:11.480 --> 25:15.000\n that we envisage for an undergraduate program.\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:17.080\n And that undergraduate program is an exciting one\n\n25:17.080 --> 25:19.680\n cause I think we can be innovative there too.\n\n25:19.680 --> 25:22.680\n I would say two years would be spent doing\n\n25:22.680 --> 25:26.640\n some very classical and difficult classical things,\n\n25:26.640 --> 25:30.960\n bridging those old divides between arts and sciences.\n\n25:30.960 --> 25:34.920\n But then there would also be in the second half\n\n25:34.920 --> 25:37.520\n in the junior and senior years,\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:41.080\n something somewhat more of an apprenticeship\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:43.560\n where we'll have centers, including a center\n\n25:43.560 --> 25:47.680\n for technology engineering mathematics\n\n25:47.680 --> 25:51.760\n that will be designed to help people make that transition\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:54.800\n from the theoretical to the practical.\n\n25:54.800 --> 25:57.000\n So that's the vision.\n\n25:57.000 --> 26:02.000\n And I think like any early stage idea\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:04.240\n we'll doubtless tweak it as we go along.\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:07.360\n We'll find things that work and things that don't work.\n\n26:07.360 --> 26:10.360\n But I have a very clear sense in my own mind\n\n26:10.360 --> 26:14.000\n of how this should look five years from now.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:14.840\n And I don't know about you.\n\n26:14.840 --> 26:16.800\n I mean, I'm unusual as an academic\n\n26:16.800 --> 26:18.800\n cause I quite like starting new institutions\n\n26:18.800 --> 26:22.320\n and I've done a bit of it in my career.\n\n26:22.320 --> 26:25.200\n You got to kind of know what it should look like\n\n26:25.200 --> 26:27.160\n after the first four or five years\n\n26:27.160 --> 26:28.680\n to get out of bed in the morning\n\n26:28.680 --> 26:31.920\n and put up with all the kind of hassles of doing it.\n\n26:31.920 --> 26:35.920\n Not least the inevitable flack that we were bound to take\n\n26:35.920 --> 26:38.120\n from the educational establishment.\n\n26:39.120 --> 26:41.960\n And I was graciously invited to be an advisor\n\n26:41.960 --> 26:45.200\n to this University of Austin.\n\n26:45.200 --> 26:49.440\n And the reason I would love to help\n\n26:49.440 --> 26:52.720\n in whatever way I can is several.\n\n26:52.720 --> 26:55.360\n So one, I would love to see Austin,\n\n26:55.360 --> 26:58.880\n the physical location flourish intellectually\n\n26:58.880 --> 27:03.320\n and especially in the space of science and engineering.\n\n27:03.320 --> 27:05.320\n That's really exciting to me.\n\n27:05.320 --> 27:09.760\n Another reason is I am still a research scientist at MIT.\n\n27:09.760 --> 27:14.760\n I still love MIT and I see this effort\n\n27:14.760 --> 27:18.880\n that you're launching as a beacon\n\n27:19.800 --> 27:23.120\n that leads the way to the other elite institutions\n\n27:23.120 --> 27:24.440\n in the world.\n\n27:24.440 --> 27:26.480\n I think too many of my colleagues\n\n27:26.480 --> 27:30.140\n and especially in robotics kind of see,\n\n27:31.760 --> 27:35.880\n don't see robotics as a humanities problem.\n\n27:35.880 --> 27:40.880\n But to me, robotics and AI will define much of our world\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:41.800\n in the next century.\n\n27:41.800 --> 27:46.800\n And for, not to consider all the deep psychological,\n\n27:46.800 --> 27:50.800\n sociological, human problems associated with that.\n\n27:51.800 --> 27:55.800\n To have real open conversations, to say stupid things,\n\n27:55.800 --> 27:59.640\n to challenge the ideas that,\n\n27:59.640 --> 28:03.120\n of how companies are being run, for example.\n\n28:03.120 --> 28:05.000\n That is the safe space.\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.600\n It's very difficult to talk about the different\n\n28:08.600 --> 28:11.160\n questions about technology when you're employed\n\n28:11.160 --> 28:13.800\n by Facebook or Google and so on.\n\n28:13.800 --> 28:17.080\n The university is the place to have those conversations.\n\n28:17.080 --> 28:18.720\n That's right, and we're hugely excited\n\n28:18.720 --> 28:21.080\n that you want to be one of our advisors.\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:26.080\n We need a broad and an eclectic group of people.\n\n28:26.080 --> 28:31.080\n And I'm excited by the way that group has developed.\n\n28:31.080 --> 28:33.960\n It has some of the, some of my favorite intellectuals\n\n28:33.960 --> 28:36.600\n are there, Steve Pinker,\n\n28:36.600 --> 28:40.280\n for example, but we're also making sure\n\n28:40.280 --> 28:45.280\n that we have people with experience in academic leadership.\n\n28:46.960 --> 28:51.960\n And so it's a happy coalition of the willing,\n\n28:51.960 --> 28:54.600\n looking to try to build something new,\n\n28:54.600 --> 28:56.800\n which as you say, will be complimentary\n\n28:56.800 --> 29:00.280\n to the existing and established institutions.\n\n29:00.280 --> 29:04.200\n I think of the academic world as a network.\n\n29:04.200 --> 29:09.200\n I've moved from some major hubs in the network to others,\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:13.720\n but I've always felt that we do our best work,\n\n29:13.720 --> 29:17.680\n not in a silo called Oxford, but in a silo\n\n29:17.680 --> 29:21.000\n that is really a hub connected to Stanford,\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:24.400\n connected to Harvard, connected to MIT.\n\n29:24.400 --> 29:26.360\n One of the reasons I moved to the United States\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:30.280\n was that I sensed that there was more intellectual action\n\n29:30.280 --> 29:35.280\n in my original field of expertise, financial history.\n\n29:35.760 --> 29:37.280\n And that was right.\n\n29:37.280 --> 29:39.000\n It was a good move.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:43.040\n I think I'd have stagnated if I'd stayed at Oxford.\n\n29:43.040 --> 29:46.400\n But at the same time, I haven't lost connection with Oxford.\n\n29:46.400 --> 29:48.800\n I recently went and gave a lecture there\n\n29:48.800 --> 29:50.480\n in honor of Sir Roger Scruton,\n\n29:50.480 --> 29:52.840\n one of the great conservative philosophers.\n\n29:52.840 --> 29:56.800\n And the burden of my lecture was the idea\n\n29:56.800 --> 30:00.000\n of the Anglosphere, which appealed a lot to Roger,\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.520\n will go horribly wrong if illiberal ideas\n\n30:04.520 --> 30:06.280\n that inhibit academic freedom spread\n\n30:06.280 --> 30:07.800\n all over the Anglosphere.\n\n30:07.800 --> 30:11.480\n And this network gets infected with these,\n\n30:11.480 --> 30:15.000\n I think, deeply damaging notions.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:18.520\n So yeah, I think we're creating a new node.\n\n30:18.520 --> 30:21.760\n I hope it's a node that makes the network overall\n\n30:21.760 --> 30:23.320\n more resilient.\n\n30:23.320 --> 30:25.840\n And right now there's an urgent need for it.\n\n30:25.840 --> 30:28.480\n I mean, there are people whose academic careers\n\n30:28.480 --> 30:30.560\n have been terminated.\n\n30:30.560 --> 30:32.640\n I'll name two who are involved.\n\n30:32.640 --> 30:37.640\n Peter Boghossian, who was harassed out of Portland State\n\n30:37.680 --> 30:42.680\n for the reason that he was one of those intrepid figures\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:47.040\n who carried out the grievance studies hoaxes,\n\n30:47.040 --> 30:50.520\n exposing the utter charlatanry going on\n\n30:50.520 --> 30:53.000\n in many supposedly academic journals\n\n30:53.000 --> 30:56.920\n by getting phony gender studies articles published.\n\n30:56.920 --> 30:57.800\n This is genius.\n\n30:57.800 --> 31:00.880\n And of course, so put the noses out of joint\n\n31:00.880 --> 31:02.280\n of the academic establishment\n\n31:02.280 --> 31:05.240\n that he began to be subject to disciplinary actions.\n\n31:05.240 --> 31:07.240\n So Peter is going to be involved.\n\n31:07.240 --> 31:10.240\n And in a recent shocking British case,\n\n31:10.240 --> 31:12.200\n the philosopher Kathleen Stock has essentially\n\n31:12.200 --> 31:15.440\n been run off the campus of Sussex University in England\n\n31:18.120 --> 31:21.280\n for violating the increasingly complex rules\n\n31:21.280 --> 31:26.160\n about discussing transgender issues and women's rights.\n\n31:26.160 --> 31:28.240\n She will be one of our advisors.\n\n31:28.240 --> 31:30.680\n And I think also one of our founding fellows\n\n31:30.680 --> 31:35.000\n actually teaching for us in our first iteration.\n\n31:35.000 --> 31:38.800\n So I think we're creating a node that's badly needed.\n\n31:38.800 --> 31:40.800\n Those people, I mean, I remember saying this\n\n31:40.800 --> 31:44.080\n to the other founders when we first began\n\n31:44.080 --> 31:48.160\n to talk about this idea to Barry Weiss\n\n31:48.160 --> 31:52.640\n and to Panna Canellos as well as to Heather Haying.\n\n31:52.640 --> 31:55.960\n We need to do this urgently because there are people\n\n31:55.960 --> 31:58.760\n whose livelihoods are in fact being destroyed\n\n31:58.760 --> 32:02.560\n by these extraordinarily illiberal campaigns against them.\n\n32:02.560 --> 32:05.040\n And so there's no time to hang around\n\n32:05.040 --> 32:07.640\n and come up with the perfect design.\n\n32:07.640 --> 32:10.120\n This is an urgently needed lifeboat.\n\n32:10.120 --> 32:11.560\n And let's start with that.\n\n32:11.560 --> 32:13.560\n And then we can build something spectacular\n\n32:13.560 --> 32:16.640\n taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have,\n\n32:16.640 --> 32:19.560\n well, they now have very real skin in the game.\n\n32:19.560 --> 32:21.720\n They need to make this a success.\n\n32:21.720 --> 32:24.520\n And I'm sure they will help us make it a success.\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:27.640\n So you mentioned some interesting names\n\n32:27.640 --> 32:30.400\n like Heather Haying, Barry Weiss, and so on.\n\n32:30.400 --> 32:32.200\n Steven Pinker, somebody I really admire.\n\n32:32.200 --> 32:35.240\n He too was under a lot of, quite a lot of fire.\n\n32:35.240 --> 32:37.840\n Many reasons I admire him.\n\n32:37.840 --> 32:40.560\n One, because of his optimism about the future.\n\n32:40.560 --> 32:44.480\n And two, how little of a damn he seems to give\n\n32:44.480 --> 32:48.040\n about like walking through the fire.\n\n32:48.040 --> 32:50.360\n There's nobody more zen about walking through the fire\n\n32:50.360 --> 32:51.320\n than Steven Pinker.\n\n32:51.320 --> 32:54.200\n But anyway, you mentioned a lot of interesting names,\n\n32:54.200 --> 32:56.920\n Jonathan Haidt is also interesting there.\n\n32:56.920 --> 33:00.880\n Who is involved with this venture at this early days?\n\n33:00.880 --> 33:04.720\n Well, one of the things that I'm excited about\n\n33:04.720 --> 33:08.200\n is that we're getting people from inside and outside\n\n33:08.200 --> 33:09.200\n the academic world.\n\n33:09.200 --> 33:12.840\n So we've got Arthur Brooks, who for many years\n\n33:12.840 --> 33:17.600\n ran the American Enterprise Institute very successfully,\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:20.720\n has a Harvard role now teaching.\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:23.680\n And so he's somebody who brings, I think,\n\n33:23.680 --> 33:27.120\n a different perspective.\n\n33:27.120 --> 33:34.480\n There's obviously a need to get experienced academic leaders\n\n33:34.480 --> 33:38.600\n involved, which is why I was talking to Larry Summers\n\n33:38.600 --> 33:43.520\n about whether he would join our board of advisors.\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:46.840\n The Chicago principals owe a debt\n\n33:46.840 --> 33:50.200\n to the former president of Chicago.\n\n33:50.200 --> 33:54.120\n And he's graciously agreed to be in the board of advisors.\n\n33:54.120 --> 33:54.720\n I could go on.\n\n33:54.720 --> 33:56.320\n It would become a long and tedious list.\n\n33:56.320 --> 34:01.960\n But my goal in trying to get this happy band to form\n\n34:01.960 --> 34:06.000\n has been to signal that it's a bipartisan endeavor.\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:08.160\n It is not a conservative institution\n\n34:08.160 --> 34:09.320\n that we're trying to build.\n\n34:09.320 --> 34:12.280\n It's an institution that's committed to academic freedom\n\n34:12.280 --> 34:18.320\n and the pursuit of truth that will mean it when it takes\n\n34:18.320 --> 34:20.400\n Robert Zimmer's Chicago principles\n\n34:20.400 --> 34:22.880\n and enshrines them in its founding charter.\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:26.520\n And we'll make those something other than honored\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:29.680\n in the breach, which they seem to be at some institutions.\n\n34:29.680 --> 34:33.320\n So the idea here is to grow this organically.\n\n34:33.320 --> 34:36.600\n We need, rather like the Academic Freedom Alliance\n\n34:36.600 --> 34:39.080\n that Robbie George created earlier this year,\n\n34:39.080 --> 34:40.560\n we need breadth.\n\n34:40.560 --> 34:42.080\n And we need to show that this is not\n\n34:42.080 --> 34:45.520\n some kind of institutionalization\n\n34:45.520 --> 34:47.920\n of the intellectual dark web, though we\n\n34:47.920 --> 34:52.480\n welcome founding members of that nebulous body.\n\n34:52.480 --> 34:55.440\n It's really something designed for all of academia\n\n34:55.440 --> 35:00.320\n to provide a kind of reboot that I think we all agree is needed.\n\n35:00.320 --> 35:02.840\n Is there a George Washington type figure?\n\n35:02.840 --> 35:04.600\n Is there a president elected yet?\n\n35:04.600 --> 35:07.240\n Or who's going to lead this institution?\n\n35:07.240 --> 35:10.240\n Panos Kanellos, the former president of St. John's,\n\n35:10.240 --> 35:12.440\n is the president of University of Austin.\n\n35:12.440 --> 35:15.400\n And so he is our George Washington.\n\n35:15.400 --> 35:17.040\n I don't know who Alexander Hamilton is.\n\n35:17.040 --> 35:18.640\n I'll leave you to guess.\n\n35:18.640 --> 35:21.880\n It's funny you mentioned IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.\n\n35:21.880 --> 35:28.400\n Have you talked to your friend Sam Harris about any of this?\n\n35:28.400 --> 35:30.760\n He is another person I really admire\n\n35:30.760 --> 35:34.520\n and I've talked to online and offline quite a bit\n\n35:34.520 --> 35:39.240\n for not belonging to any tribe.\n\n35:39.240 --> 35:43.080\n He stands boldly on his convictions\n\n35:43.080 --> 35:46.880\n when he knows they're not going to be popular.\n\n35:46.880 --> 35:51.640\n Like he basically gets canceled by every group.\n\n35:51.640 --> 35:54.320\n He doesn't shy away from controversy.\n\n35:54.320 --> 35:57.040\n And not for the sake of controversy itself,\n\n35:57.040 --> 36:00.240\n he is one of the best examples to me\n\n36:00.240 --> 36:02.680\n of a person who thinks freely.\n\n36:02.680 --> 36:06.000\n I disagree with him on quite a few things,\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:10.640\n but I deeply admire that he is what it looks\n\n36:10.640 --> 36:12.840\n like to think freely by himself.\n\n36:12.840 --> 36:14.360\n It feels to me like he represents\n\n36:14.360 --> 36:16.560\n a lot of the ideals of this kind of effort.\n\n36:16.560 --> 36:18.560\n Yes, he would be a natural fit.\n\n36:18.560 --> 36:21.440\n Sam, if you're listening, I hope you're in.\n\n36:21.440 --> 36:25.680\n I think in the course of his recent intellectual quests,\n\n36:25.680 --> 36:28.120\n he did collide with one of our founders, Heather Haying.\n\n36:28.120 --> 36:31.080\n So we'll have to model civil disagreements\n\n36:31.080 --> 36:32.640\n at the University of Austin.\n\n36:32.640 --> 36:35.000\n It's extremely important that we should all\n\n36:35.000 --> 36:38.920\n disagree about many things, but do it amicably.\n\n36:38.920 --> 36:41.160\n One of the things that has been lost sight of,\n\n36:41.160 --> 36:42.880\n perhaps it's all the fault of Twitter\n\n36:42.880 --> 36:44.360\n or maybe it's something more profound,\n\n36:44.360 --> 36:47.720\n is that it is possible to disagree in a civil way\n\n36:47.720 --> 36:49.720\n and still be friends.\n\n36:49.720 --> 36:52.080\n I certainly had friends at Oxford\n\n36:52.080 --> 36:54.520\n who were far to the left of me politically,\n\n36:54.520 --> 36:56.560\n and they are still among my best friends.\n\n36:56.560 --> 36:58.680\n So the University of Austin has to be a place\n\n36:58.680 --> 37:03.400\n where we can disagree vehemently,\n\n37:03.400 --> 37:06.600\n but we can then go and have a beer afterwards.\n\n37:06.600 --> 37:09.800\n That's, in my mind, a really important part\n\n37:09.800 --> 37:12.840\n of university life, learning the difference\n\n37:12.840 --> 37:15.680\n between the political and the personal.\n\n37:15.680 --> 37:19.080\n So Sam is, I think, a good example, as are you,\n\n37:19.080 --> 37:24.120\n of a certain kind of intellectual hero\n\n37:24.120 --> 37:31.120\n who has been willing to go into the cyber sphere,\n\n37:31.120 --> 37:37.480\n the metaverse, and carve out an intellectual space,\n\n37:37.480 --> 37:42.960\n the podcast, and debate everything fearlessly.\n\n37:42.960 --> 37:48.280\n His essay, it was really an essay on Black Lives Matter\n\n37:48.280 --> 37:50.840\n and the question of police racism,\n\n37:50.840 --> 37:54.360\n was a masterpiece of 2020.\n\n37:54.360 --> 38:01.320\n And so he, I think, is a model of what we believe in.\n\n38:01.320 --> 38:03.880\n But we can't save the world with podcasts,\n\n38:03.880 --> 38:06.840\n good though yours is,\n\n38:06.840 --> 38:11.840\n because there's a kind of solo element\n\n38:11.840 --> 38:15.080\n to this form of public intellectual activity.\n\n38:15.080 --> 38:16.760\n It's also there in Substack,\n\n38:16.760 --> 38:19.880\n where all our best writers now seem to be,\n\n38:19.880 --> 38:22.600\n including our founder, Barry Weiss.\n\n38:22.600 --> 38:26.880\n The danger with this approach is, ultimately,\n\n38:26.880 --> 38:30.400\n your subscribers are the people who already agree with you,\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:32.040\n and we are all, therefore,\n\n38:32.040 --> 38:35.760\n in danger of preaching to the choir.\n\n38:35.760 --> 38:38.160\n I think what makes an institution like University of Austin\n\n38:38.160 --> 38:41.920\n so attractive is that we get everybody together,\n\n38:41.920 --> 38:44.440\n at least part of the year,\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:51.800\n and we do that informal interaction at lunch, at dinner,\n\n38:51.800 --> 38:57.320\n that allows, in my experience, the best ideas to form.\n\n38:57.320 --> 39:00.480\n Intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage.\n\n39:00.480 --> 39:02.480\n Historians often make it seem that way,\n\n39:02.480 --> 39:06.000\n but I've realized over time that I do my best work\n\n39:06.000 --> 39:08.160\n in a collaborative way,\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:10.640\n and scientists have been better at this\n\n39:10.640 --> 39:12.440\n than people in the humanities.\n\n39:12.440 --> 39:13.760\n But what really matters,\n\n39:13.760 --> 39:16.120\n what's magical about a good university,\n\n39:16.120 --> 39:19.520\n is that interdisciplinary, serendipitous conversation\n\n39:19.520 --> 39:21.440\n that happens on campus.\n\n39:21.440 --> 39:24.760\n Tom Sargent, the great Nobel Prize winning economist and I,\n\n39:24.760 --> 39:27.800\n used to have these kind of random conversations\n\n39:27.800 --> 39:31.520\n in elevators at NYU or in corridors at Stanford,\n\n39:31.520 --> 39:34.680\n and sometimes they'd be quite short conversations,\n\n39:34.680 --> 39:38.040\n but in that short, serendipitous exchange,\n\n39:38.040 --> 39:40.520\n I would have more intellectual stimulus\n\n39:40.520 --> 39:44.400\n than in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half.\n\n39:44.400 --> 39:47.280\n So I think we want to get the Sam Harris's\n\n39:47.280 --> 39:51.440\n and Lex Friedman's out of their darkened rooms\n\n39:51.440 --> 39:54.000\n and give them a chance to interact\n\n39:54.000 --> 39:59.360\n in a much less structured way than we've got used to.\n\n39:59.360 --> 40:02.720\n Again, it's that sense that sometimes\n\n40:02.720 --> 40:05.600\n you need some freewheeling, unstructured debate\n\n40:05.600 --> 40:07.280\n to get the really good ideas.\n\n40:07.280 --> 40:08.920\n I mean, to talk anecdotally for a moment,\n\n40:08.920 --> 40:12.000\n I look back on my Oxford undergraduate experience\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:14.680\n and I wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes,\n\n40:14.680 --> 40:18.200\n but intellectually, the most important thing I did\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:22.400\n was to write an essay on the Viennese satirist Karl Kraus\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:27.440\n for an undergraduate discussion group called the Canon Club.\n\n40:27.440 --> 40:29.960\n And I probably put more work into that paper\n\n40:29.960 --> 40:31.440\n than I put into anything else,\n\n40:31.440 --> 40:33.800\n except maybe my final examinations,\n\n40:33.800 --> 40:36.600\n even although there was only really one senior member\n\n40:36.600 --> 40:38.800\n present, the historian Jeremy Cato,\n\n40:38.800 --> 40:41.880\n I was really just trying to impress my contemporaries.\n\n40:41.880 --> 40:45.720\n And that's the kind of thing we want.\n\n40:45.720 --> 40:51.080\n The great intellectual leaps forward, occurred,\n\n40:51.080 --> 40:54.160\n often in somewhat unstructured settings.\n\n40:54.160 --> 40:57.160\n I'm from Scotland, you can tell from my accent,\n\n40:57.160 --> 40:59.560\n a little at least.\n\n40:59.560 --> 41:03.000\n The enlightenment happened in late 18th century Scotland\n\n41:03.000 --> 41:07.280\n in a very interesting interplay between the universities,\n\n41:07.280 --> 41:10.120\n which were very important, Glasgow, Edinburgh,\n\n41:10.120 --> 41:14.560\n St Andrews, and the coffee houses and pubs\n\n41:14.560 --> 41:19.760\n of the Scottish cities where a lot of unstructured discussion\n\n41:19.760 --> 41:24.080\n often fueled by copious amounts of wine took place.\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:27.280\n That's what I've missed over the last few years.\n\n41:27.280 --> 41:32.480\n Let's just think about how hard academic social life has become.\n\n41:32.480 --> 41:37.760\n That we've reached the point that Amy Chewer\n\n41:37.760 --> 41:41.600\n becomes the object of a full blown investigation\n\n41:41.600 --> 41:47.200\n and media storm for inviting to Yale Law School students\n\n41:47.200 --> 41:50.840\n over to her house to talk.\n\n41:50.840 --> 41:52.480\n I mean, when I was at Oxford, it was regarded\n\n41:52.480 --> 41:54.800\n as a tremendous honor to be asked\n\n41:54.800 --> 41:58.040\n to go to one of our tutors homes.\n\n41:58.040 --> 41:59.680\n The social life of Oxford and Cambridge\n\n41:59.680 --> 42:01.120\n is one of their great strengths.\n\n42:01.120 --> 42:03.960\n There's a sort of requirement to sip\n\n42:03.960 --> 42:06.520\n unpleasant sherry with the dons.\n\n42:06.520 --> 42:08.360\n And we've kind of killed all that.\n\n42:08.360 --> 42:10.040\n We've killed all that in the US because nobody\n\n42:10.040 --> 42:13.040\n dares have a social interaction with an undergraduate\n\n42:13.040 --> 42:15.720\n or exchange an informal email in case\n\n42:15.720 --> 42:18.200\n the whole thing ends up on the front page of the local\n\n42:18.200 --> 42:19.520\n or student newspaper.\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:22.960\n So that's what we need to kind of restore,\n\n42:22.960 --> 42:25.560\n the social life of academia.\n\n42:25.560 --> 42:26.400\n So there's magic.\n\n42:26.400 --> 42:29.320\n We didn't really address this sort of explicitly.\n\n42:29.320 --> 42:33.520\n But there's magic to the interaction between students.\n\n42:33.520 --> 42:37.400\n There's magic in the interaction between faculty,\n\n42:37.400 --> 42:38.360\n the people that teach.\n\n42:38.360 --> 42:39.880\n And there's the magic in the interaction\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:41.600\n between the students and the faculty.\n\n42:41.600 --> 42:46.040\n And it's an iterative process that changes everybody involved.\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:48.960\n So it's like world experts in a particular discipline\n\n42:48.960 --> 42:52.880\n are changed as much as the students,\n\n42:52.880 --> 42:56.960\n as the 20 year olds with the wild ideas,\n\n42:56.960 --> 42:59.160\n each are changed and that's the magic of it.\n\n42:59.160 --> 43:01.160\n That applies in liberal education,\n\n43:01.160 --> 43:03.520\n that applies in the sciences too.\n\n43:03.520 --> 43:05.560\n That's probably maybe you can speak to this,\n\n43:05.560 --> 43:08.760\n why so much scientific innovation\n\n43:08.760 --> 43:10.640\n has happened in universities.\n\n43:10.640 --> 43:13.600\n There's something about the youthful energy\n\n43:13.600 --> 43:16.480\n of like young minds, graduate students,\n\n43:16.480 --> 43:18.480\n undergraduate students that inspire\n\n43:18.480 --> 43:19.520\n some of the world experts\n\n43:19.520 --> 43:21.960\n to do some of the best work of their lives.\n\n43:21.960 --> 43:25.080\n Well, the human brain we know is at its most dynamic\n\n43:25.080 --> 43:27.240\n when people are pretty young.\n\n43:27.240 --> 43:29.600\n You know this with your background in math,\n\n43:29.600 --> 43:32.960\n people don't get better at math after the age of 30.\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:36.800\n And this is important when you think about\n\n43:36.800 --> 43:39.760\n the intergenerational character of university.\n\n43:39.760 --> 43:44.160\n The older people, the professors have the experience,\n\n43:44.160 --> 43:46.760\n but they're fading intellectually\n\n43:46.760 --> 43:50.200\n from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit.\n\n43:50.200 --> 43:55.200\n And so you get this intellectual shot in the arm\n\n43:55.720 --> 43:59.320\n from hanging out with people who are circa 20,\n\n43:59.320 --> 44:04.240\n don't know shit, but brains are kind of like cooking.\n\n44:04.240 --> 44:07.320\n I look back on the career I've had in teaching,\n\n44:07.320 --> 44:10.560\n which is over 25 years at where Cambridge, Oxford,\n\n44:10.560 --> 44:15.440\n NYU, Harvard, and I have extremely strong relationships\n\n44:15.440 --> 44:19.440\n with students from those institutions\n\n44:19.440 --> 44:23.160\n because they would show up,\n\n44:23.160 --> 44:26.120\n whether it was at office hours or in tutorials\n\n44:26.120 --> 44:28.120\n and disagree with me.\n\n44:28.120 --> 44:31.800\n And for me, it's always been about encouraging\n\n44:31.800 --> 44:34.120\n some act of intellectual rebellion,\n\n44:35.040 --> 44:38.720\n telling people, I don't want your essay to echo my views.\n\n44:38.720 --> 44:41.760\n If you can find something wrong with what I wrote, great.\n\n44:41.760 --> 44:45.360\n Or if you can find something I missed that's new, fantastic.\n\n44:45.360 --> 44:47.040\n So there is definitely, as you said,\n\n44:47.040 --> 44:49.840\n a magic in that interaction across the generations.\n\n44:49.840 --> 44:53.280\n And it's extraordinarily difficult, I think,\n\n44:53.280 --> 44:57.240\n for an intellectual to make the same progress\n\n44:57.240 --> 45:00.120\n in a project in isolation\n\n45:00.120 --> 45:03.280\n compared with the progress that can be made\n\n45:03.280 --> 45:05.840\n in these very special communities.\n\n45:05.840 --> 45:07.560\n What does a university do?\n\n45:07.560 --> 45:09.320\n Amongst other things,\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:13.120\n it creates a somewhat artificial environment\n\n45:13.120 --> 45:15.280\n of abnormal job security,\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:18.560\n and that's the whole idea of giving people tenure,\n\n45:18.560 --> 45:22.640\n and then a relatively high turnover, new faces each year,\n\n45:22.640 --> 45:27.080\n and an institutionalization of thought experiments\n\n45:27.080 --> 45:29.040\n and actual experiments.\n\n45:29.040 --> 45:30.360\n And then you get everybody living\n\n45:30.360 --> 45:31.600\n in the same kind of vicinity\n\n45:31.600 --> 45:34.720\n so that it can spill over into 3 a.m. conversation.\n\n45:34.720 --> 45:36.520\n Well, that always seems to me\n\n45:36.520 --> 45:39.200\n to be a pretty potent combination.\n\n45:39.200 --> 45:41.720\n Let's ask ourselves a counterfactual question next.\n\n45:41.720 --> 45:46.720\n Let's imagine that the world wars happen,\n\n45:47.560 --> 45:49.760\n but there are no universities.\n\n45:51.320 --> 45:53.880\n I mean, how does the Manhattan Project happen\n\n45:53.880 --> 45:58.200\n with no academia, to take just one of many examples?\n\n45:58.200 --> 46:01.200\n In truth, how does Britain even stay in the war\n\n46:01.200 --> 46:02.400\n without Bletchley Park,\n\n46:02.400 --> 46:07.400\n without being able to crack the German cipher?\n\n46:07.400 --> 46:11.800\n The academics are unsung, or partly sung heroes\n\n46:11.800 --> 46:13.360\n of these conflicts.\n\n46:14.320 --> 46:15.960\n The same is true in the Soviet Union.\n\n46:15.960 --> 46:19.600\n The Soviet Union was a terribly evil and repressive system,\n\n46:19.600 --> 46:21.320\n but it was good at science,\n\n46:21.320 --> 46:23.920\n and that kept it in the game,\n\n46:23.920 --> 46:27.840\n not only in World War II, it kept it in the Cold War.\n\n46:27.840 --> 46:32.840\n So it's clear that universities are incredibly powerful,\n\n46:32.840 --> 46:35.560\n intellectual force multipliers,\n\n46:35.560 --> 46:40.200\n and our history without them would look very different.\n\n46:40.200 --> 46:42.440\n Sure, some innovations would have happened without them.\n\n46:42.440 --> 46:43.280\n That's clear.\n\n46:43.280 --> 46:45.240\n The Industrial Revolution didn't need universities.\n\n46:45.240 --> 46:47.520\n In fact, they played a very marginal role\n\n46:47.520 --> 46:49.120\n in the key technological breakthroughs\n\n46:49.120 --> 46:52.200\n of the Industrial Revolution in its first phase.\n\n46:52.200 --> 46:54.240\n But by the second Industrial Revolution\n\n46:54.240 --> 46:55.880\n in the late 19th century,\n\n46:55.880 --> 46:58.040\n German industry would not have leapt ahead\n\n46:58.040 --> 46:59.840\n of British industry if the universities\n\n46:59.840 --> 47:01.680\n had not been superior.\n\n47:01.680 --> 47:04.320\n And it was the fact that the Germans institutionalised\n\n47:04.320 --> 47:07.320\n scientific research in the way that they did\n\n47:07.320 --> 47:11.640\n that really produced a powerful, powerful advantage.\n\n47:11.640 --> 47:13.480\n The problem was that,\n\n47:13.480 --> 47:15.240\n and this is a really interesting point\n\n47:15.240 --> 47:18.160\n that Friedrich Meinlka makes in Die Deutsche Katastrophe\n\n47:18.160 --> 47:19.960\n for the German Catastrophe,\n\n47:19.960 --> 47:24.160\n the German intellectuals became technocrats, homo faber,\n\n47:24.160 --> 47:25.000\n he says.\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:28.160\n They knew a great deal about their speciality,\n\n47:28.160 --> 47:31.920\n but they were alienated from, broadly speaking, humanism.\n\n47:31.920 --> 47:33.120\n And that is his explanation,\n\n47:33.120 --> 47:35.200\n or one of his explanations for why\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:37.800\n this very scientifically advanced Germany\n\n47:37.800 --> 47:41.600\n goes down the path of hell led by Hitler.\n\n47:41.600 --> 47:43.400\n So when I come back and ask myself,\n\n47:43.400 --> 47:47.320\n what is it that we want to do with a new university,\n\n47:47.320 --> 47:52.320\n we wanna make sure that we don't fall into that German pit\n\n47:52.320 --> 47:56.360\n where very high levels of technical and scientific expertise\n\n47:56.360 --> 48:00.440\n are decoupled from the fundamental foundations\n\n48:00.440 --> 48:03.400\n of a free society.\n\n48:04.280 --> 48:05.800\n So liberal arts are there, I think,\n\n48:05.800 --> 48:09.720\n to stop the scientists making Faustian pacts.\n\n48:09.720 --> 48:11.400\n And that's why it's really important\n\n48:11.400 --> 48:15.480\n that people working on AI reach Shakespeare.\n\n48:15.480 --> 48:19.600\n I think you said that academics are unsung heroes\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:21.680\n of the 20th century.\n\n48:21.680 --> 48:25.160\n I think there's kind of an intellectual,\n\n48:25.160 --> 48:30.160\n a lazy intellectual desire to kind of destroy\n\n48:30.160 --> 48:32.640\n the academics, that the academics are the source\n\n48:32.640 --> 48:34.760\n of all problems in the world.\n\n48:34.760 --> 48:37.440\n And I personally believe that exactly as you said,\n\n48:37.440 --> 48:40.320\n we need to recognize that the university\n\n48:40.320 --> 48:45.000\n is probably where the ideas that will protect us\n\n48:45.000 --> 48:50.000\n from the catastrophes that are looming ahead of us,\n\n48:50.480 --> 48:52.720\n that's where those ideas are going to come from.\n\n48:52.720 --> 48:56.840\n People who work on economics can argue back and forth\n\n48:56.840 --> 48:58.200\n about John Maynard Keynes.\n\n48:58.200 --> 49:00.720\n But I think it's pretty clear\n\n49:00.720 --> 49:03.200\n that he was the most important economist\n\n49:03.200 --> 49:05.520\n and certainly the most influential economist\n\n49:05.520 --> 49:06.600\n of the 20th century.\n\n49:06.600 --> 49:11.320\n And I think his ideas are looking better today\n\n49:11.320 --> 49:12.960\n in the wake of the financial crisis\n\n49:12.960 --> 49:15.840\n than they have at any time since the 1970s.\n\n49:15.840 --> 49:19.920\n But imagine John Maynard Keynes without Cambridge,\n\n49:19.920 --> 49:24.920\n you can't because someone like that doesn't actually exist\n\n49:24.920 --> 49:27.520\n without the incredible hothouse\n\n49:27.520 --> 49:30.200\n that a place like Cambridge was in Keynes's life.\n\n49:30.200 --> 49:32.720\n He was a product of a kind of hereditary\n\n49:32.720 --> 49:36.160\n intellectual elite, it had its vices.\n\n49:36.160 --> 49:40.160\n But you can't help but admire the sheer power of the mind.\n\n49:40.160 --> 49:42.400\n I've spent a lot of my career reading Keynes\n\n49:42.400 --> 49:47.400\n and I revere that intellect, it's so, so powerful.\n\n49:47.400 --> 49:49.760\n But you can't have people like that\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:53.600\n if you're not prepared to have King's College Cambridge.\n\n49:53.600 --> 49:55.280\n And it comes with redundancy.\n\n49:55.280 --> 49:56.120\n I think that's the point.\n\n49:56.120 --> 49:57.720\n There are lots and lots of things\n\n49:57.720 --> 50:00.520\n that are very annoying about academic life\n\n50:00.520 --> 50:03.320\n that you just have to deal with.\n\n50:03.320 --> 50:06.200\n They're made fun of in that recent Netflix series,\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:07.360\n The Chair.\n\n50:07.360 --> 50:09.720\n And it is easy to make fun of academic life.\n\n50:10.720 --> 50:13.040\n Tom Sharp's Porterhouse Blue did it.\n\n50:13.040 --> 50:17.040\n It's an inherently comical subject.\n\n50:17.040 --> 50:20.520\n Professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric.\n\n50:20.520 --> 50:24.200\n But we've sort of killed off that side of academia\n\n50:24.200 --> 50:29.200\n by turning it into an increasingly doctrinaire place\n\n50:30.440 --> 50:33.040\n where eccentricity is not tolerated.\n\n50:33.040 --> 50:34.280\n I'll give you an illustration of this.\n\n50:34.280 --> 50:37.640\n I had a call this morning from a British academic\n\n50:38.640 --> 50:40.720\n who said, can you give me some advice\n\n50:40.720 --> 50:44.960\n because they're trying to decolonize the curriculum.\n\n50:45.840 --> 50:47.680\n This is coming from the,\n\n50:47.680 --> 50:50.800\n diversity, equity and inclusion officers.\n\n50:50.800 --> 50:54.120\n And it seems to me that what they're requiring of us\n\n50:54.120 --> 50:56.680\n is a fundamental violation of academic freedom\n\n50:56.680 --> 50:59.840\n because it is determining ex ante\n\n50:59.840 --> 51:01.640\n what we should study and teach.\n\n51:02.640 --> 51:04.160\n That's what's going on.\n\n51:04.160 --> 51:08.680\n And that's the thing that we really, really have to resist\n\n51:08.680 --> 51:10.280\n because that kills the university.\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:13.520\n That's the moment that it stops being\n\n51:13.520 --> 51:15.440\n the magical place of,\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:20.240\n being the magical place of intellectual creativity\n\n51:20.240 --> 51:22.040\n and simply becomes an adjunct\n\n51:22.040 --> 51:24.000\n of the ministry of propaganda.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:27.240\n I've loved the time we've spent talking about this\n\n51:27.240 --> 51:28.920\n because it's such a hopeful message\n\n51:28.920 --> 51:30.240\n for the future of the university\n\n51:30.240 --> 51:33.440\n that I still share with you\n\n51:35.160 --> 51:37.840\n the love of the ideal of the university.\n\n51:37.840 --> 51:39.400\n So very practical question.\n\n51:39.400 --> 51:41.320\n You mentioned summer.\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:44.600\n Which summer are we talking about?\n\n51:44.600 --> 51:48.400\n So when, I know we don't wanna put hard dates here\n\n51:48.400 --> 51:51.160\n but what year are we thinking about?\n\n51:51.160 --> 51:52.600\n When is this thing launching?\n\n51:52.600 --> 51:53.800\n What are your thoughts on this?\n\n51:53.800 --> 51:57.600\n We are moving as fast as our resources allow.\n\n51:57.600 --> 52:01.800\n The goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses\n\n52:01.800 --> 52:03.840\n next summer, summer of 2022.\n\n52:03.840 --> 52:06.720\n And we hope to be able to launch an initial,\n\n52:08.560 --> 52:12.280\n albeit relatively small scale master's program\n\n52:12.280 --> 52:14.480\n in the fall of next year.\n\n52:14.480 --> 52:17.200\n That's as fast as humanly possible.\n\n52:18.360 --> 52:21.000\n So yeah, we're really keen to get going.\n\n52:21.000 --> 52:22.920\n And I think the approach we're taking\n\n52:22.920 --> 52:27.080\n is somewhat imported from Silicon Valley.\n\n52:27.080 --> 52:29.080\n Think of this as a startup.\n\n52:29.080 --> 52:31.120\n Don't think of this as something that has to exist\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:33.840\n as a full service university on day one.\n\n52:33.840 --> 52:35.200\n We don't have the resources for that.\n\n52:35.200 --> 52:36.760\n You did billions and billions of dollars\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:40.040\n to build a university sort of as a facsimile\n\n52:40.040 --> 52:41.120\n of an existing university,\n\n52:41.120 --> 52:42.280\n but that's not what we want to do.\n\n52:42.280 --> 52:45.640\n I mean, copying and pasting Harvard or Yale or Stanford\n\n52:45.640 --> 52:46.840\n would be a futile thing to do.\n\n52:46.840 --> 52:49.200\n They would probably, you very quickly end up\n\n52:49.200 --> 52:50.440\n with the same pathologies.\n\n52:50.440 --> 52:52.240\n So we do have to come up with a different design.\n\n52:52.240 --> 52:54.680\n And one way of doing that is to grow it organically\n\n52:54.680 --> 52:56.000\n from something quite small.\n\n52:56.880 --> 53:01.880\n Elon Musk mentioned in his usual humorous way on Twitter\n\n53:02.120 --> 53:03.600\n that he wants to launch\n\n53:03.600 --> 53:07.600\n the Texas Institute of Technology and Science, TITS.\n\n53:09.400 --> 53:11.400\n Some people thought this was sexist\n\n53:11.400 --> 53:13.920\n because of the acronym, TITS.\n\n53:13.920 --> 53:16.560\n So first of all, I understand their viewpoint,\n\n53:16.560 --> 53:18.640\n but I also think there needs to be a place\n\n53:18.640 --> 53:21.560\n for humor on the internet, even from CEOs.\n\n53:21.560 --> 53:23.800\n So on this podcast, I've gotten a chance\n\n53:23.800 --> 53:26.440\n to talk to quite a few CEOs.\n\n53:26.440 --> 53:29.560\n And what I love to see is authenticity.\n\n53:29.560 --> 53:33.080\n And humor is often a sign of authenticity.\n\n53:33.080 --> 53:36.880\n The quirkiness that you mentioned\n\n53:36.880 --> 53:39.520\n is such a beautiful characteristic\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:42.520\n of professors and faculty in great universities\n\n53:42.520 --> 53:46.280\n is also beautiful to see as CEOs, especially founding CEOs.\n\n53:46.280 --> 53:51.280\n So anyway, the deeper point he was making\n\n53:51.480 --> 53:54.360\n is showing an excitement for the university\n\n53:54.360 --> 53:59.360\n as a place for big ideas in science, technology, engineering.\n\n53:59.600 --> 54:02.960\n So to me, if there's some kind of way,\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:07.520\n if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet,\n\n54:07.520 --> 54:10.920\n not to analyze Elon Musk's Twitter like it's Shakespeare,\n\n54:10.920 --> 54:12.840\n but if there's a serious thought,\n\n54:13.960 --> 54:18.320\n I would love to see him supporting the flourishing of Austin\n\n54:18.320 --> 54:20.360\n as a place for science, technology,\n\n54:20.360 --> 54:22.280\n for these kinds of intellectual developments\n\n54:22.280 --> 54:25.880\n that we're talking about,\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:30.880\n like make a place for free inquiry, civil disagreements,\n\n54:31.640 --> 54:35.840\n coupled with great education and conversations\n\n54:35.840 --> 54:37.880\n about artificial intelligence, about technology,\n\n54:37.880 --> 54:39.280\n about engineering.\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:41.800\n So I'm actually gonna,\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:43.840\n I hope there's a serious idea behind that tweet\n\n54:43.840 --> 54:46.320\n and I'm gonna chat with him about it.\n\n54:46.320 --> 54:47.160\n I do too.\n\n54:47.160 --> 54:48.760\n I do too.\n\n54:48.760 --> 54:53.760\n Most of the biggest storms in teacups of my academic career\n\n54:56.440 --> 54:59.920\n have been caused by bad jokes that I've made.\n\n54:59.920 --> 55:04.000\n These days, if you wanna make bad jokes,\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.840\n being a billionaire is a great idea.\n\n55:08.080 --> 55:12.400\n I'm not here to defend Elon's Twitter style\n\n55:12.400 --> 55:14.320\n or sense of humor.\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:18.320\n He's not gonna be remembered for his tweets, I think.\n\n55:18.320 --> 55:19.320\n He's gonna be remembered\n\n55:19.320 --> 55:22.320\n for the astonishing companies that he's built\n\n55:22.320 --> 55:26.720\n and his contributions in a whole range of fields\n\n55:26.720 --> 55:31.720\n from SpaceX to Tesla and solar energy.\n\n55:31.720 --> 55:35.400\n And I very much hope that we can interest Elon\n\n55:35.400 --> 55:36.240\n in this project.\n\n55:36.240 --> 55:40.560\n We need not only Elon, but a whole range of his peers\n\n55:41.640 --> 55:45.160\n because this takes resources.\n\n55:45.160 --> 55:47.400\n Universities are not cheap things to run,\n\n55:47.400 --> 55:49.480\n especially if, as I hope,\n\n55:49.480 --> 55:54.480\n we can make as much of the tuition\n\n55:55.880 --> 55:57.600\n covered by scholarships and bursaries.\n\n55:57.600 --> 56:02.240\n We want to attract the best intellectual talent\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:04.400\n to this institution.\n\n56:04.400 --> 56:05.800\n The best intellectual talent\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:08.360\n is somewhat randomly distributed through society.\n\n56:08.360 --> 56:09.960\n And some of it is in the bottom quintile\n\n56:09.960 --> 56:11.680\n of the income distribution.\n\n56:11.680 --> 56:13.800\n And that makes it hard to get to elite education.\n\n56:13.800 --> 56:16.040\n So this will take resources.\n\n56:17.120 --> 56:22.120\n The last generation of super wealthy plutocrats,\n\n56:22.240 --> 56:25.880\n the generation of the Gilded Age of the late 19th century,\n\n56:25.880 --> 56:28.640\n did a pretty good job of funding universities.\n\n56:28.640 --> 56:33.040\n Now Chicago wouldn't exist, but for the money of that era.\n\n56:33.040 --> 56:35.400\n And so my message to not only to Elon,\n\n56:35.400 --> 56:38.480\n but to all of the peers, all of those people\n\n56:38.480 --> 56:41.160\n who made their billions out of technology\n\n56:41.160 --> 56:44.360\n over the last couple of decades is this is your time.\n\n56:44.360 --> 56:45.760\n I mean, and this is your opportunity\n\n56:45.760 --> 56:47.120\n to create something new.\n\n56:47.120 --> 56:51.120\n I can't really understand why the wealthy of our time\n\n56:51.120 --> 56:53.680\n are content to hand their money.\n\n56:53.680 --> 56:56.600\n I mean, think of the vast sums Mike Bloomberg\n\n56:56.600 --> 57:01.600\n recently gave to Johns Hopkins to established institutions.\n\n57:01.640 --> 57:05.720\n When on close inspection, those institutions\n\n57:05.720 --> 57:10.200\n don't seem to spend the money terribly well.\n\n57:10.200 --> 57:12.880\n And in fact, one of the mysteries of our time\n\n57:12.880 --> 57:14.440\n is the lack of due diligence\n\n57:14.440 --> 57:16.960\n that hard nosed billionaires seem to do\n\n57:16.960 --> 57:19.280\n when it comes to philanthropy.\n\n57:19.280 --> 57:21.720\n So I think there's an opportunity here\n\n57:21.720 --> 57:25.160\n for this generation of very talented, wealthy people\n\n57:25.160 --> 57:29.000\n to do what their counterparts did in the late 19th\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:32.600\n and early 20th century and create some new institutions.\n\n57:32.600 --> 57:34.840\n And they don't need to put their names on the buildings.\n\n57:34.840 --> 57:39.000\n They just need to do what the founders of Chicago,\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:40.440\n University of Chicago did,\n\n57:40.440 --> 57:43.280\n create something new that will endure.\n\n57:45.360 --> 57:49.160\n Yeah, MIT is launching a college of computing\n\n57:49.160 --> 57:54.160\n and Stephen Schwarzman has given quite a large sum of money,\n\n57:54.320 --> 57:56.840\n I think in total, a billion dollars.\n\n57:56.840 --> 57:59.360\n And as somebody who loves computing,\n\n57:59.360 --> 58:02.280\n as somebody who loves MIT, I want some accountability\n\n58:03.520 --> 58:07.040\n for MIT becoming a better institution.\n\n58:07.040 --> 58:08.800\n And this is once again,\n\n58:08.800 --> 58:10.720\n why I'm excited about University of Austin\n\n58:10.720 --> 58:12.240\n because it serves as a beacon.\n\n58:12.240 --> 58:14.400\n Look, you can create something new\n\n58:14.400 --> 58:16.440\n and this is what the great institutions\n\n58:16.440 --> 58:18.320\n of the future should look like.\n\n58:18.320 --> 58:22.440\n And Steve Schwarzman is also an innovator.\n\n58:22.440 --> 58:26.920\n The idea of creating a college on the Tsinghua campus\n\n58:26.920 --> 58:28.720\n and creating a kind of Rhodes program\n\n58:28.720 --> 58:30.080\n for students from the Western world\n\n58:30.080 --> 58:33.400\n to come study in China was Steve's idea.\n\n58:33.400 --> 58:35.480\n And I was somewhat involved,\n\n58:35.480 --> 58:38.600\n did some visiting, professing there.\n\n58:38.600 --> 58:41.520\n It taught me that you can create something new\n\n58:42.480 --> 58:45.120\n in that area of graduate education\n\n58:45.120 --> 58:49.800\n and quite quickly attract really strong applicants\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:52.400\n because the people who finished their four years\n\n58:52.400 --> 58:57.400\n at Harvard or Stanford know that they don't know a lot.\n\n58:57.600 --> 59:02.400\n And I, having taught a lot of people in that group,\n\n59:02.400 --> 59:06.240\n know how intellectually dissatisfied they often are\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:08.040\n at the end of four years.\n\n59:08.040 --> 59:10.280\n I mean, they may have beautifully gamed the system\n\n59:10.280 --> 59:12.520\n to graduate summa magna cum laude,\n\n59:12.520 --> 59:15.760\n but they kind of know they'll confess it\n\n59:15.760 --> 59:16.800\n after a drink or two.\n\n59:16.800 --> 59:18.320\n They know that they gamed the system\n\n59:18.320 --> 59:20.400\n and that intellectually it wasn't\n\n59:20.400 --> 59:22.320\n the fulfilling experience they wanted.\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:26.280\n And they also know that an MBA from a comparable institution\n\n59:26.280 --> 59:29.360\n would not be a massive intellectual step forward.\n\n59:29.360 --> 59:32.240\n So I think what we want to say is,\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:35.240\n here's something really novel, exciting,\n\n59:35.240 --> 59:37.880\n that will be intellectually very challenging.\n\n59:37.880 --> 59:42.360\n I do think the University of Austin has to be difficult.\n\n59:42.360 --> 59:44.040\n I'd like it to feel a little bit like\n\n59:44.040 --> 59:47.000\n surviving Navy SEAL training to come through this program\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:49.400\n because it will be intellectually demanding.\n\n59:49.400 --> 59:51.320\n That I think should be a magnet.\n\n59:51.320 --> 59:54.280\n So yeah, Steve, if you're listening,\n\n59:54.280 --> 59:56.840\n please join Elon in supporting this.\n\n59:56.840 --> 59:59.760\n And Peter Thiel, if you're listening,\n\n59:59.760 --> 1:00:02.160\n I know how skeptical you are about the idea\n\n1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:04.680\n of creating a new university because heaven knows,\n\n1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:06.560\n Peter and I have been discussing this idea for years\n\n1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.440\n and he's always said, well, no, we thought about this\n\n1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:09.360\n and it just isn't gonna work.\n\n1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:14.360\n But I really think we've got a responsibility to do this.\n\n1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:17.000\n Well, Steve's been on this podcast before.\n\n1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.800\n We've spoken a few times, so I'll send this to him.\n\n1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:22.200\n I hope he does actually get behind it as well.\n\n1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:26.200\n So I'm super excited by the ideas\n\n1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:29.600\n that we've been talking about that this effort represents\n\n1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:32.800\n and what ripple effect it has on the rest of society.\n\n1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:33.640\n So thank you.\n\n1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:36.240\n That was a time beautifully spent.\n\n1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:41.240\n And I'm really grateful for the fortune\n\n1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:43.600\n of getting a chance to talk to you\n\n1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.320\n at this moment in history\n\n1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:47.800\n because I've been a big fan of your work\n\n1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:50.440\n and the reason I wanted to talk to you today\n\n1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:53.960\n is about all the excellent books you've written\n\n1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.120\n about various aspects of history through money, war,\n\n1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:00.560\n power, pandemics, all of that.\n\n1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.360\n But I'm glad that we got a chance to talk about this,\n\n1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:07.960\n which is not looking at history, it's looking at the future.\n\n1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:12.400\n This is a beautiful little fortuitous moment.\n\n1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:15.280\n I appreciate you talking about it.\n\n1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.800\n In the book, Ascent of Money,\n\n1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:21.560\n you give a history of the world through the lens of money.\n\n1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:24.680\n If the financial system is a evolutionary nature,\n\n1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.160\n much like life on earth,\n\n1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:28.720\n what is the origin of money on earth?\n\n1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:33.080\n The origin of money predates coins.\n\n1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.720\n Most people kind of assume I'll talk about coins,\n\n1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:39.120\n but coins are relatively late developments.\n\n1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:41.960\n Back in ancient Mesopotamia,\n\n1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:44.120\n so I don't know, 5,000 years ago,\n\n1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:49.120\n there were relations between creditors and debtors.\n\n1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:52.240\n There are even in the simplest economy\n\n1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.840\n because of the way in which agriculture works.\n\n1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:58.760\n Hey, I need to plant these seeds,\n\n1:01:58.760 --> 1:02:01.440\n but I'm not gonna have crops for X months.\n\n1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.440\n So we have clay tablets\n\n1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:07.440\n in which simple debt transactions are inscribed.\n\n1:02:07.440 --> 1:02:09.440\n I remember looking at great numbers of these\n\n1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:10.280\n in the British Museum\n\n1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:12.800\n when I was writing The Ascent of Money.\n\n1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:15.840\n And that's really the beginning of money.\n\n1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:18.800\n The minute you start recording a relationship\n\n1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:19.920\n between a creditor and a debtor,\n\n1:02:19.920 --> 1:02:22.520\n you have something that is quasi money.\n\n1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:23.520\n And that is probably what these\n\n1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:28.520\n clay tablets mostly denoted.\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.520\n From that point on,\n\n1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:32.960\n there's a great evolutionary experiment\n\n1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:36.760\n to see what the most convenient way is\n\n1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:41.760\n to record relations between creditors and debtors.\n\n1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:47.960\n And what emerges in the time of the ancient Greeks\n\n1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.640\n are coins, metal, tokens,\n\n1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:55.640\n sometimes a valuable metal, sometimes not,\n\n1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:59.320\n usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch.\n\n1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:03.320\n And that's the sort of more familiar form of money\n\n1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:07.320\n that we still use today for very, very small transactions.\n\n1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:09.640\n I expect coins will all be gone\n\n1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:12.720\n by the time my youngest son is my age,\n\n1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.720\n but the money that I have is still there.\n\n1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.080\n My youngest son is my age,\n\n1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:21.040\n but they're a last remnant of a very, very old way\n\n1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:24.320\n of doing simple transactions.\n\n1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:27.840\n And when you say coins, you mean physical coins.\n\n1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:30.640\n I'm talking about coins have been rebranded\n\n1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:31.480\n in the digital space as well.\n\n1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:34.120\n Yeah, not coin based coins, actual coin coins.\n\n1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:36.400\n You know, the ones that jangle in your pocket\n\n1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:38.520\n and you kind of don't know quite what to do with\n\n1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.800\n once you have some.\n\n1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:44.800\n So that became an incredibly pervasive form\n\n1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:47.360\n of paying for things.\n\n1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:50.000\n Money's just a, it's just a crystallization\n\n1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000\n of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor.\n\n1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.080\n And the coins are just very fungible.\n\n1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:58.800\n Whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction,\n\n1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:00.320\n coins are generic and fungible.\n\n1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.200\n They can be used in any transaction.\n\n1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:05.040\n So that was an important evolutionary advance.\n\n1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:06.360\n If you think of financial history,\n\n1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:08.240\n and this was the point of the ascent of money,\n\n1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:12.520\n as an evolutionary story, there are punctuated equilibria.\n\n1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.440\n People get by with coins for a long time,\n\n1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:19.080\n despite their defects as a means of payment,\n\n1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:23.120\n such as that they can be debased, they can be clipped.\n\n1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:27.160\n It's very hard to avoid fake or debased money\n\n1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:28.760\n entering the system.\n\n1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:31.800\n But coinage is still kind of the basis of payments\n\n1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:34.200\n all the way through the Roman Empire,\n\n1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:36.960\n out the other end into the so called dark ages.\n\n1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:39.400\n It's still how most things are settled\n\n1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:43.880\n in cash transactions in the early 1300s.\n\n1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:47.800\n You don't get a big shift until after the Black Death,\n\n1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:50.920\n when there's such a need to monetize the economy\n\n1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:52.440\n because of chronic labor shortages\n\n1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:54.720\n and feudalism begins to unravel,\n\n1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:58.880\n that you just don't have a sufficient amount of coinage.\n\n1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:00.240\n And so you get bills of exchange.\n\n1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:02.720\n And I'm really into bills of exchange,\n\n1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:07.560\n because, and this I hope will capture your listeners\n\n1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:09.360\n and viewers imaginations,\n\n1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.240\n when they start using bills of exchange,\n\n1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:17.240\n which are really just pieces of paper saying,\n\n1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:19.360\n I owe you over a three month period\n\n1:05:19.360 --> 1:05:23.880\n while goods are in transit from Florence to London,\n\n1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:27.960\n you get the first peer to peer payment system,\n\n1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:29.640\n which is network verified,\n\n1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:31.320\n because they're not coins,\n\n1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:33.480\n they don't have a King's head on them.\n\n1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.320\n They're just pieces of paper.\n\n1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:38.320\n And the verification comes in the form of signatures.\n\n1:05:38.320 --> 1:05:42.680\n And you need ultimately some kind of guarantee\n\n1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:46.560\n if I write an IOU to you, bills of exchange,\n\n1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:48.320\n I mean, you don't really know me that well,\n\n1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:49.400\n we only just met.\n\n1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:52.080\n So you might wanna get endorsed by, I don't know,\n\n1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:54.960\n somebody really credit worthy like Elon.\n\n1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:58.200\n And so we actually can see in the late 14th century\n\n1:05:58.200 --> 1:06:00.960\n in Northern Italy and England and elsewhere,\n\n1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:04.560\n the evolution of a peer to peer network system\n\n1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.240\n of payment.\n\n1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:09.240\n And that's actually how world trade grows,\n\n1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:11.160\n because you just couldn't settle\n\n1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:14.040\n long oceanic transactions with coinage.\n\n1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:15.720\n It just wasn't practical.\n\n1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:18.320\n All those treasure chests full of the balloons,\n\n1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:21.120\n which were part of the way in which the Spanish empire worked\n\n1:06:21.120 --> 1:06:22.640\n really inefficient.\n\n1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:26.240\n So bills of exchange are an exciting part of the story.\n\n1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:29.520\n And they illustrate something I should have made more clear\n\n1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:31.280\n in the ascent of money,\n\n1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:34.520\n that not everything used in payment needs to be money.\n\n1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:39.000\n Classically, economists will tell you, oh, well, money,\n\n1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.320\n money has three different functions.\n\n1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:43.320\n It's you've heard this a zillion times, right?\n\n1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:46.280\n It's a unit of account, it's a store of value,\n\n1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:47.760\n and it's a medium of exchange.\n\n1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:51.560\n Now, there are three or four things\n\n1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:53.840\n that are worth saying about this, and I'll just say two.\n\n1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:57.120\n One, it may be that those three things are a trilemma,\n\n1:06:57.120 --> 1:06:59.480\n and it's very difficult for anything to be all of them.\n\n1:06:59.480 --> 1:07:01.920\n This point was made by my Hoover colleague,\n\n1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:03.440\n Manny Rincon Cruz last year,\n\n1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:05.680\n and I still wish he would write this up as a paper\n\n1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:07.680\n because it's a great insight.\n\n1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.760\n The second thing that's really interesting to me\n\n1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.880\n is that payments don't need to be money.\n\n1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.120\n And if we go around, as economists love to do,\n\n1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:17.880\n saying, well, Bitcoin's not money\n\n1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:20.680\n because it doesn't fulfill these criteria,\n\n1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:21.720\n we're missing the point\n\n1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:24.560\n that you could build a system of payments,\n\n1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:26.840\n which I think is how we should think about crypto\n\n1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:29.120\n that isn't money, doesn't need to be money.\n\n1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:30.560\n It's like bills of exchange.\n\n1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:33.600\n It's network based verification,\n\n1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:38.000\n peer to peer transactions without third party verification.\n\n1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.240\n When it hit me the other day\n\n1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.480\n that we actually have this precedent for crypto,\n\n1:07:41.480 --> 1:07:43.560\n I got quite excited and thought,\n\n1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:46.560\n I wish I had written that in the Ascent of Money.\n\n1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:48.760\n Can you sort of from a first principles,\n\n1:07:48.760 --> 1:07:50.760\n like almost like a physics perspective,\n\n1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:54.160\n or maybe a human perspective,\n\n1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:58.720\n describe where does the value of money come from?\n\n1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.520\n Like where is it actually, where is it?\n\n1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:04.720\n So it's a sheet of paper or it's coins,\n\n1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:08.080\n but it feels like in a platonic sense,\n\n1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:09.200\n there's some kind of thing\n\n1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:11.160\n that's actually storing the value.\n\n1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:13.800\n As us, a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on.\n\n1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:17.360\n I come from a family of physicists.\n\n1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:18.560\n I'm the black sheep of the family.\n\n1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:21.120\n My mother's a physicist, my sister is.\n\n1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:23.360\n And so when you asked me to explain something\n\n1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:27.360\n in physics terms, I get a kind of little part of me dies\n\n1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:28.960\n because I know I'll fail.\n\n1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:33.000\n But in truth, it doesn't really matter\n\n1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.400\n what we decide money is going to be.\n\n1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:41.400\n And anything can record, crystallize\n\n1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:44.640\n the relationship between the creditor and the debtor.\n\n1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.360\n It could be a piece of paper, it can be a piece of metal.\n\n1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.760\n It can be nothing, can just be a digital entry.\n\n1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:56.440\n It's trust that we're really talking about here.\n\n1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:59.680\n We are not just trusting one another.\n\n1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:02.880\n We may not, but we are trusting the money.\n\n1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:07.480\n So whatever we use to represent\n\n1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:10.200\n the creditor debtor relationship,\n\n1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:13.160\n whether it's a banknote or a coin or whatever,\n\n1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:16.560\n it does depend on us both trusting it.\n\n1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.640\n And that doesn't always pertain.\n\n1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:25.080\n What we see in episodes of inflation,\n\n1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.880\n especially episodes of hyperinflation,\n\n1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:29.920\n is a crisis of trust, a crisis of confidence\n\n1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.000\n in the means of payments.\n\n1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.920\n And this is very traumatic for the societies\n\n1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.880\n to which it happens.\n\n1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:40.000\n By and large, human beings,\n\n1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.040\n particularly once you have a rule of law system\n\n1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:44.680\n of the sort that evolved in the West\n\n1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.560\n and then became generalized,\n\n1:09:46.560 --> 1:09:49.640\n are predisposed to trust one another.\n\n1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:52.560\n And the default setting is to trust money.\n\n1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:54.960\n Even when it depreciates at a quite steady rate\n\n1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.960\n as the US dollar has done pretty much uninterruptedly\n\n1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:05.080\n since the 1960s, it takes quite a big disruption\n\n1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:07.520\n for money to lose that trust.\n\n1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:11.720\n But I think essentially what money should be thought of as\n\n1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:15.880\n is a series of tokens that can take any form we like\n\n1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:18.200\n and can be purely digital,\n\n1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:23.200\n which represent our transactions as creditors and debtors.\n\n1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:26.640\n And the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work.\n\n1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:29.840\n I had to explain this to Stephen Colbert once\n\n1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:33.520\n in the Colbert Show, the old show that was actually funny.\n\n1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:37.800\n And it was a great moment when he said,\n\n1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:41.880\n so Neil, could I be money?\n\n1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:46.880\n And I said, yes, we could settle a debt\n\n1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:50.600\n with a human being that was quite common in much of history,\n\n1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:54.200\n but it's not the most convenient form of money.\n\n1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.960\n Money has to be convenient.\n\n1:10:56.960 --> 1:10:58.920\n That's why when they worked out\n\n1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:00.840\n how to make payments with cell phones,\n\n1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:04.680\n the Chinese simply went straight there from bank accounts.\n\n1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:06.160\n They skipped out credit cards.\n\n1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.120\n You won't see credit cards in China,\n\n1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.760\n except in the hands of naive tourists.\n\n1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:14.280\n How much can this trust bear\n\n1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:18.080\n in terms of us humans with our human nature testing it?\n\n1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:21.960\n I guess the surprising thing is the thing works.\n\n1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:25.520\n A bunch of self interested ants running around\n\n1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:27.360\n trading in trust.\n\n1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:31.200\n And it seems to work except for a bunch of moments\n\n1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:33.120\n in human history when there's hyperinflation,\n\n1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:34.280\n like you mentioned.\n\n1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:38.480\n And it's just kind of amazing.\n\n1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:40.440\n It's kind of amazing that us humans,\n\n1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:42.520\n if I were to be optimistic and sort of hopeful\n\n1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:45.000\n about human nature, it gives me a sense\n\n1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.240\n that people want to lean on each other.\n\n1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:51.240\n They want to trust.\n\n1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:54.840\n That's certainly, I would say probably now,\n\n1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:59.680\n a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists,\n\n1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:00.960\n network scientists.\n\n1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:03.840\n It's one of Nicholas Christakis's argument\n\n1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:05.760\n in a recent book.\n\n1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:08.960\n I know economic history broadly bears this out,\n\n1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:12.160\n but you have to be cautious.\n\n1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:17.160\n The cases where the system works are familiar to us.\n\n1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:23.560\n Because those are the states and the eras\n\n1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:26.480\n that produce a lot of written records.\n\n1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.280\n But when the system of trust collapses\n\n1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.480\n and the monetary system collapses with it,\n\n1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.040\n there's generally quite a paucity of records.\n\n1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:38.240\n I found that when I was writing Doom.\n\n1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.120\n And so we slightly are biased in favor of the periods\n\n1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:47.040\n when trust prevailed and the system functioned.\n\n1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.840\n It's very easy to point to a great many episodes\n\n1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:53.480\n of very, very intense monetary chaos,\n\n1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:55.960\n even in the relatively recent past.\n\n1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:58.760\n In the wake of the First World War,\n\n1:12:58.760 --> 1:13:01.280\n multiple currencies, not just the German currency,\n\n1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:03.560\n multiple currencies were completely destroyed.\n\n1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:05.880\n The Russian currency, the Polish currency.\n\n1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:08.720\n There were currency disasters all over\n\n1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:12.440\n Central and Eastern Europe in the early 1920s.\n\n1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:16.440\n And that was partly because over the course\n\n1:13:16.440 --> 1:13:18.720\n of the 19th century, a system had evolved\n\n1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:22.640\n in which trust was based on gold\n\n1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:27.040\n and rules that were supposedly applied by central banks.\n\n1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.160\n That system, which produced relative price stability\n\n1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:35.160\n over the 19th century, fell apart\n\n1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:36.720\n as a result of the First World War.\n\n1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.200\n And as soon as it was gone, as soon as there was no longer\n\n1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:44.960\n a clear link between those banknotes and coins and gold,\n\n1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:47.280\n the whole thing went completely haywire.\n\n1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:50.040\n And I think we should remember that the extent\n\n1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:54.240\n of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918\n\n1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.480\n all the way through to the late 1940s.\n\n1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:57.920\n I mean, the German currency was destroyed\n\n1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:00.080\n not once but twice in that period.\n\n1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:01.800\n And that was one of the most advanced economies\n\n1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:02.760\n in the world.\n\n1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:06.200\n In the United States, there were periods\n\n1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:09.520\n of intensely deep deflation.\n\n1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:12.880\n Prices fell by a third in the Great Depression.\n\n1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:15.280\n And then very serious price volatility\n\n1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.280\n in the immediate post World War II period.\n\n1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:19.960\n So it's a bit of an illusion.\n\n1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:24.240\n Maybe it's an illusion for people who've spent most\n\n1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:26.560\n of their lives in the last 20 years.\n\n1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:29.480\n We've had a period of exceptional price stability\n\n1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:34.480\n since this century began in which a regime\n\n1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:37.800\n of central bank independence and inflation targeting\n\n1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:42.360\n appeared to generate steady below 2% inflation\n\n1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:43.600\n in much of the developed world.\n\n1:14:43.600 --> 1:14:46.440\n It was a bit too low for the central bankers liking.\n\n1:14:46.440 --> 1:14:49.120\n And that became a problem in the financial crisis.\n\n1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:52.960\n But we've avoided major price instability\n\n1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.800\n for the better part of 20 years.\n\n1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:56.080\n In most of the world, there haven't really been\n\n1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:59.200\n that many very high inflation episodes\n\n1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:00.920\n and hardly any hyperinflationary episodes.\n\n1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:03.960\n Venezuela's one of the very few, Zimbabwe's another.\n\n1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:06.480\n But if you take a 100 year view or a 200 year view,\n\n1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:08.600\n or if you want to take a 500 year view,\n\n1:15:08.600 --> 1:15:12.720\n you realize that quite often the system doesn't work.\n\n1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:14.680\n If you go back to the 17th century,\n\n1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.640\n there were multiple competing systems of coinage.\n\n1:15:17.640 --> 1:15:19.600\n There had been a great inflation that had begun\n\n1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:21.560\n the previous century.\n\n1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:24.760\n The price revolution caused mainly by the rise\n\n1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:28.960\n and caused mainly by the arrival of new world silver.\n\n1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:31.760\n I think financial history is a bit messier\n\n1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:33.760\n than one might think.\n\n1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:37.600\n And the more one studies it, the more one realizes\n\n1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:39.320\n the need for the evolution.\n\n1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:41.960\n The reason bills of exchange came along\n\n1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.000\n was because the coinage systems had stopped working.\n\n1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.720\n The reason that banknotes started to become used\n\n1:15:47.720 --> 1:15:50.080\n more generally first in the American colonies\n\n1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:52.320\n in the 17th century, then more widely in the 18th century\n\n1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:56.120\n was just that they were more convenient than any other way\n\n1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:57.320\n of paying for things.\n\n1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:00.480\n We had to invent the bond market in the 18th century\n\n1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:02.200\n to cope with the problem of public debt,\n\n1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.600\n which up until that point had been a recurrent source\n\n1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:06.880\n of instability.\n\n1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:10.000\n And then we invented equity finance\n\n1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.840\n because bonds were not enough.\n\n1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:16.400\n So I would prefer to think of the financial history\n\n1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:18.920\n as a series of crises really that are resolved\n\n1:16:18.920 --> 1:16:22.640\n by innovations and in the most recent episode,\n\n1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:25.040\n very exciting episode of financial history,\n\n1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.240\n something called Bitcoin initiated a new financial\n\n1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:31.880\n or monetary revolution in response, I think,\n\n1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:36.080\n to the growing crisis of the fiat money system.\n\n1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:37.640\n Can you speak to that?\n\n1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.680\n So what do you think about Bitcoin?\n\n1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.440\n What do you think it is a response to?\n\n1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:46.400\n What are the growing problems of the fiat system?\n\n1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:49.400\n What is this moment in human history\n\n1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:52.160\n that is full of challenges that Bitcoin\n\n1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:54.160\n and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome?\n\n1:16:55.240 --> 1:17:00.240\n I don't think Bitcoin was devised by Satoshi,\n\n1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:05.800\n whoever he was, for fear of a breakdown\n\n1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:07.400\n of the fiat currencies.\n\n1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:11.200\n If it was, it was a very far sighted enterprise\n\n1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:12.560\n because certainly in 2008,\n\n1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:14.320\n when the first Bitcoin paper appeared,\n\n1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:18.080\n it wasn't very likely that a wave of inflation was coming.\n\n1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:20.360\n If anything, there was more reason\n\n1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.240\n to fear deflation at that point.\n\n1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:26.360\n I think it would be more accurate to say\n\n1:17:26.360 --> 1:17:28.800\n that with the advent of the internet,\n\n1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:31.160\n there was a need for a means of payment\n\n1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:33.280\n native to the internet,\n\n1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:36.280\n typing your credit card number into a random website.\n\n1:17:36.280 --> 1:17:40.240\n It's not the way to pay for things on the internet.\n\n1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:43.560\n And I'd rather think of Bitcoin as the first iteration,\n\n1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:45.160\n the first attempt to solve the problem\n\n1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:46.320\n of how do we pay for things\n\n1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:48.800\n in what we must learn to call the metaverse,\n\n1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:52.520\n but let's just call it the internet for old time's sake.\n\n1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.040\n And ever since that initial innovation,\n\n1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:58.600\n the realization that you could use computing power\n\n1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:01.720\n and cryptography to create peer to peer payments\n\n1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.160\n without third party verification,\n\n1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:07.160\n a revolution has been gathering momentum\n\n1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:08.920\n that poses a very profound threat\n\n1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:13.240\n to the existing legacy system of banks and fiat currencies.\n\n1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:15.600\n Most money in the world today is made by banks,\n\n1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:17.760\n not central banks, banks.\n\n1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:21.840\n That's what most money is, it's entries in bank accounts.\n\n1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.840\n And what Bitcoin represents\n\n1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:27.040\n is an alternative mode of payment\n\n1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:30.280\n that really ought to render banks obsolete.\n\n1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:33.560\n I think this financial revolution\n\n1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:37.480\n has got past the point at which it can be killed.\n\n1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.720\n It was vulnerable in the early years,\n\n1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.400\n but it now has sufficient adoption\n\n1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:45.480\n and has generated sufficient additional layers.\n\n1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:47.400\n I mean, Ethereum was in many ways\n\n1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:48.880\n the more important innovation\n\n1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:52.280\n because you can build a whole system of payments\n\n1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:55.000\n and ultimately smart contracts on top of ether.\n\n1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:56.280\n I think we've now reached the point\n\n1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:59.800\n that it's pretty hard to imagine it all being killed.\n\n1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:01.640\n And it's just survived an amazing thing,\n\n1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:03.640\n which was the Chinese shutting down mining\n\n1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:04.560\n and shutting down everything.\n\n1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:09.200\n And still here we are, in fact, cryptos thriving.\n\n1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:13.200\n What we don't know is how much damage\n\n1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:16.880\n ill judged regulatory interventions are going to do\n\n1:19:16.880 --> 1:19:19.040\n to this financial revolution.\n\n1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:20.680\n Left to its own devices,\n\n1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:24.200\n I think decentralized finance provides\n\n1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:28.240\n the native monetary and financial system for the internet.\n\n1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:32.360\n And the more time we spend in the metaverse,\n\n1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:34.440\n the more use we will make of it.\n\n1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:36.440\n The next things that will happen, I think,\n\n1:19:36.440 --> 1:19:40.360\n will be that tokens in game spaces like Roblox\n\n1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:41.520\n will become fungible.\n\n1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:45.000\n As my nine year old spends a lot more time\n\n1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.720\n playing on computer games than I ever did,\n\n1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:49.560\n I can see that entertainment\n\n1:19:49.560 --> 1:19:52.480\n is becoming a game driven phenomenon.\n\n1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:56.640\n And in the game space, you need skins for your avatar.\n\n1:19:56.640 --> 1:20:01.040\n The economics of the internet, it's evolving very fast.\n\n1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:02.040\n And in parallel,\n\n1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:04.920\n you can see this payments revolution happening.\n\n1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:08.720\n I think that all goes naturally very well\n\n1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:13.000\n and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process.\n\n1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:17.160\n The problem is there are people in Washington\n\n1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:20.400\n with an overwhelming urge to intervene\n\n1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:24.080\n and disrupt this evolutionary process.\n\n1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:28.280\n Partly, I think out of a muddled sense\n\n1:20:28.280 --> 1:20:31.680\n that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on.\n\n1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:34.280\n If we don't step in, many more will go on.\n\n1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.880\n This, I think, greatly exaggerates\n\n1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:39.600\n how much criminal activity is in fact going on in the space.\n\n1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.520\n But there's also the vested interests at work.\n\n1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:45.960\n It was odd to me, maybe not odd,\n\n1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:47.080\n perhaps it wasn't surprising,\n\n1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:48.840\n that the Bank for International Settlements\n\n1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:52.040\n earlier this year published a report,\n\n1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:55.680\n one chapter of which said this must all go, must all stop.\n\n1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:57.520\n It's all gotta be shut down\n\n1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:00.920\n and it's gotta be replaced by central bank digital currency.\n\n1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:02.800\n And Martin Wolf in the Financial Times read this\n\n1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:04.400\n and said, I agree with this.\n\n1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:07.280\n And one suddenly realized that the banks are clever.\n\n1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.720\n They had achieved the intellectual counterattack\n\n1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:14.760\n with almost no fingerprints on the weapon.\n\n1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:18.960\n I think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea.\n\n1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:22.600\n I can't imagine why we would want to copy a Chinese model\n\n1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:25.200\n that essentially takes all transactions\n\n1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:26.960\n and puts them directly under the surveillance\n\n1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.320\n of a central government institution.\n\n1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:33.320\n But that suddenly is a serious counterproposal.\n\n1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:39.320\n So on the one side, we have a relatively decentralized,\n\n1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:44.040\n technologically innovative internet native system\n\n1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:46.840\n of payments that has the possibility to evolve,\n\n1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:51.160\n to produce a full set of smart contracts,\n\n1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:54.120\n reducing enormously the transaction costs\n\n1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:56.080\n that we currently encounter in the financial world\n\n1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:57.760\n because it gets rid of all those middlemen\n\n1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:00.600\n who take their cut every time you take out a mortgage\n\n1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:01.720\n or whatever it is.\n\n1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:03.560\n That's one alternative.\n\n1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.440\n But on the other side, we have a highly centralized system\n\n1:22:06.440 --> 1:22:08.400\n in which transactions will by default\n\n1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:10.760\n be under the surveillance of the central bank.\n\n1:22:10.760 --> 1:22:12.360\n It seems like an easy choice to me,\n\n1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:14.920\n but hey, I have this thing about personal liberty.\n\n1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:17.760\n So that's where we are.\n\n1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:22.680\n I don't think that the regulators can kill web three.\n\n1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.080\n I think we're supposed to call it web three\n\n1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:26.720\n because crypto is now an obsolescent term.\n\n1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:28.160\n They can't kill it,\n\n1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:30.360\n but they can definitely make it difficult\n\n1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:33.520\n and throw a lot of sand into the machine.\n\n1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.200\n And I think worst of all,\n\n1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:37.680\n they can spoil the evolutionary story\n\n1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:40.680\n by creating central bank digital currency\n\n1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:42.960\n that I don't think we really need.\n\n1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:47.440\n Or we certainly don't need it in the Chinese form.\n\n1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:51.720\n Do you think Bitcoin has a strong chance\n\n1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:53.320\n to take over the world?\n\n1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:57.040\n So become the primary,\n\n1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:00.480\n you mentioned the three things that make money, money,\n\n1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:02.720\n become the primary methodology\n\n1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:05.880\n by which we store wealth, we exchange.\n\n1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:07.160\n No.\n\n1:23:07.160 --> 1:23:09.600\n No, I think what Bitcoin is,\n\n1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.160\n this was a phrase that I got from my friend,\n\n1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:13.880\n Matt McLennan at First Eagle,\n\n1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:15.760\n an option on digital gold.\n\n1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:18.520\n So it's the gold of the system,\n\n1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:20.720\n but currently behaves like an option.\n\n1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:22.360\n That's why it's quite volatile\n\n1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:23.800\n because we don't really know\n\n1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:28.800\n if this brave new world of crypto is gonna work.\n\n1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:31.240\n But if it does work, then Bitcoin is the gold\n\n1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:33.440\n because of the finite supply.\n\n1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:37.280\n What role we need gold to play in the metaverse\n\n1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:38.880\n isn't quite clear.\n\n1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:40.720\n I love that you're using the term metaverse.\n\n1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:41.600\n This is great.\n\n1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:43.760\n Well, I just like the metaversity\n\n1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:48.400\n as the antithesis of what we're trying to do in Austin.\n\n1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:52.320\n But can you imagine I'm using it sarcastically?\n\n1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:54.520\n I come from Glasgow where all novel words\n\n1:23:54.520 --> 1:23:55.760\n have to be used sarcastically.\n\n1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:57.560\n So the metaverse, sarcastic.\n\n1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:00.360\n But see, the beauty about humor and sarcasm\n\n1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:03.520\n is that the joke becomes reality.\n\n1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.800\n I mean, it's like using the word Big Bang\n\n1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:07.560\n to describe the origins of the universe.\n\n1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:09.440\n It becomes like that.\n\n1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:10.280\n It will.\n\n1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:11.800\n After a while, it's in the textbooks\n\n1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:12.880\n and nobody's laughing.\n\n1:24:12.880 --> 1:24:14.320\n Yeah, well, that's exactly right.\n\n1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:15.360\n Humor is sticky.\n\n1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:18.760\n Yeah, I'm on the side of humor,\n\n1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:21.400\n but it is a dangerous activity these days.\n\n1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:25.360\n Anyway, I think Bitcoin is the option of digital gold.\n\n1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:30.360\n The role it plays is probably not so much store of value.\n\n1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:33.840\n Right now, it's just nicely not very correlated asset\n\n1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:35.240\n in your portfolio.\n\n1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:36.840\n When I updated the Ascent of Money,\n\n1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.120\n which was in 2018, 10 years after it came out,\n\n1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:42.280\n I wrote a new chapter in which I said,\n\n1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:48.200\n Bitcoin, which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble,\n\n1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.320\n will rise again through adoption\n\n1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:54.200\n because if every millionaire in the world\n\n1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:57.840\n has 0.2% of his or her wealth in Bitcoin,\n\n1:24:57.840 --> 1:24:59.960\n the price should be $15,000.\n\n1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:03.360\n If it's 1%, it's $75,000.\n\n1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:06.080\n And it might not even stay at 1%\n\n1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:08.200\n because, I mean, look at its recent performance.\n\n1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:13.040\n If your exposure to global stocks had been hedged\n\n1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:16.280\n with a significant crypto holding,\n\n1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:19.240\n you would have aced the last few months.\n\n1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:23.080\n So I think the non correlation property\n\n1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:26.200\n is very, very important in driving adoption.\n\n1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:28.280\n And the volatility also drives adoption\n\n1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:31.040\n if you're a sophisticated investor.\n\n1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:35.520\n So I think the adoption drives Bitcoin up\n\n1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:37.200\n because it's the option of digital gold,\n\n1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:40.080\n but it's also just this nicely not very correlated asset\n\n1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:41.680\n that you wanna hold.\n\n1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:43.920\n In a world where, what the hell?\n\n1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:46.400\n I mean, the central bank's gonna tighten.\n\n1:25:46.400 --> 1:25:48.600\n We've come through this massively disruptive effort\n\n1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:51.640\n of the pandemic, public debt soared,\n\n1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:53.600\n money printing soared.\n\n1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:56.760\n You could hang around with your bonds\n\n1:25:56.760 --> 1:25:59.920\n and wait for the euthanasia of the Rontier.\n\n1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:01.840\n You can hang on to your tech stocks\n\n1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.760\n and just hope there isn't a massive correction\n\n1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:05.160\n or dot, dot, dot.\n\n1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.840\n Well, and it seems like a fairly obvious strategy\n\n1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:10.680\n to make sure that you have at least some crypto\n\n1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:15.680\n for the coming year, given what we likely have to face.\n\n1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:17.720\n I think what's really interesting is that\n\n1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:20.080\n on top of Ethereum,\n\n1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:25.080\n a more elaborate financial system is being built.\n\n1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:31.520\n Stable coins are the interesting puzzle for me\n\n1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:34.360\n because we need off ramps.\n\n1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.440\n Ultimately, you and I have to pay taxes in US dollars.\n\n1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:43.400\n And there's no getting away from that.\n\n1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:45.560\n The IRS is gonna let us hold crypto\n\n1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:48.000\n as long as we pay our taxes.\n\n1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.400\n And the only question in my mind is\n\n1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:54.760\n what's the optimal off ramp to make those taxes,\n\n1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:56.120\n make those tax payments?\n\n1:26:57.080 --> 1:27:01.240\n Probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by Facebook.\n\n1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:05.240\n Never struck me as the best solution to this problem.\n\n1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:07.440\n Maybe it's some kind of Fed coin\n\n1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:12.800\n or maybe one of the existing algorithmic stable coins\n\n1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:13.640\n does the job.\n\n1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:16.520\n But we clearly need some stable off ramp.\n\n1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:18.640\n So you don't think it's possible for the IRS\n\n1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:21.000\n within the next decade to be accepting Bitcoin\n\n1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:22.560\n as tax payments?\n\n1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:24.040\n I doubt that.\n\n1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:25.960\n Having dealt with the IRS now\n\n1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:28.600\n since when did I first come here, 2002,\n\n1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:32.240\n it's hard to think of an institution less likely\n\n1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:37.240\n to leap into the 21st century when it comes to payments.\n\n1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:44.240\n No, I think we'll be tolerated, crypto world will be tolerated\n\n1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:46.120\n as long as we pay our taxes.\n\n1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:48.840\n And it's important that we're already at that point.\n\n1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:50.160\n And then the next question becomes,\n\n1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:53.480\n well, does Gary Gensler define everything as a security?\n\n1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:56.680\n And do we then have to go through endless\n\n1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:00.120\n regulatory contortions to satisfy the SEC?\n\n1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:03.240\n There's a whole bunch of uncertainties\n\n1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:06.000\n that the administrative state excels at creating\n\n1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:09.120\n because that's just how the administrative state works.\n\n1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:10.480\n You'll do something new.\n\n1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:13.520\n Hmm, I'll decide whether that's a security\n\n1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:15.680\n but don't expect me to define it for you.\n\n1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:18.960\n I'll decide in an arbitrary way and then you'll owe me money.\n\n1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:21.080\n So all of this is going to be very annoying.\n\n1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:25.160\n And for people who are trying to run exchanges\n\n1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:29.200\n or innovate in the space, these regulations will be annoying.\n\n1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.960\n But the problem with FinTech is it's different from tech,\n\n1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:33.760\n broadly defined.\n\n1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.960\n When tech got into eCommerce with Amazon,\n\n1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:40.320\n when it got into social networking with Facebook,\n\n1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:43.600\n there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate.\n\n1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.600\n But welcome to the world of finance,\n\n1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:48.800\n which has always been a jungle of regulation\n\n1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:53.440\n because the regulation is there to basically entrench\n\n1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:54.240\n the incumbents.\n\n1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:56.040\n That's what it's for.\n\n1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:59.840\n So it'll be a much tougher fight than the fights\n\n1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:04.840\n we've seen of other aspects of the tech revolution\n\n1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:09.600\n because the incumbents are there and they see the threat.\n\n1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:13.040\n And in the end, Satoshi said it very explicitly.\n\n1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:15.720\n It's peer to peer payment without third party verification.\n\n1:29:15.720 --> 1:29:18.120\n And all the third parties are going, wait, what?\n\n1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:19.400\n We're the third parties.\n\n1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.920\n So there is a connection between power and money.\n\n1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:29.080\n You've mentioned World War I from the perspective of money.\n\n1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:34.080\n So power, money, war, authoritarian regimes.\n\n1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:37.280\n From the perspective of money,\n\n1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:42.080\n do you have hope that cryptocurrency can help resist war,\n\n1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:46.200\n can help resist the negative effects\n\n1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:47.920\n of authoritarian regimes?\n\n1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:50.360\n Or is that a silly hope?\n\n1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:57.360\n Wars happen because the people who have the power\n\n1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:02.840\n to command armed forces miscalculate.\n\n1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:04.840\n That's generally what happens.\n\n1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:09.400\n And we will have a big war in the near future\n\n1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:12.600\n if both the Chinese government and the US government\n\n1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:17.560\n miscalculates and they unleash lethal force on one another.\n\n1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:20.400\n And there's nothing that any financial institution\n\n1:30:20.400 --> 1:30:24.480\n can do to stop that any more than the Rothschilds\n\n1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:26.480\n could stop World War I.\n\n1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:28.880\n And they were then the biggest bank in the world by far\n\n1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.720\n with massive international financial influence.\n\n1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:36.560\n So let's accept that war is in a different domain.\n\n1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:42.200\n War would impact the financial world massively\n\n1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:44.720\n if it were a war between the United States and China\n\n1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:49.560\n because there's still a huge China trade on.\n\n1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:53.120\n Wall Street is long China, Europe is long China.\n\n1:30:54.120 --> 1:30:56.760\n So the conflict that I can foresee in the future\n\n1:30:56.760 --> 1:31:00.120\n is one that's highly financially disruptive.\n\n1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:01.560\n Where does crypto fit in?\n\n1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:07.040\n Crypto's obvious utility in the short run\n\n1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:11.040\n is as a store of wealth, of transferable wealth\n\n1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:12.960\n for people who live in a world\n\n1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:15.720\n of transferable wealth for people who live\n\n1:31:15.720 --> 1:31:18.880\n in dangerous places with failing,\n\n1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:21.680\n not just failing money, but failing rule of law.\n\n1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:22.960\n That's why in Latin America,\n\n1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:24.680\n there's so much interest in crypto\n\n1:31:24.680 --> 1:31:26.800\n because Latin Americans have a lot of monetary history\n\n1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:28.840\n to look back on and not much of it is good.\n\n1:31:30.160 --> 1:31:35.160\n So I think that the short run problem that crypto solves\n\n1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:39.280\n is, and this goes back to the digital gold point,\n\n1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:43.160\n if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law\n\n1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:44.840\n and weak property rights,\n\n1:31:44.840 --> 1:31:49.400\n here is a new and better way to have portable wealth.\n\n1:31:51.400 --> 1:31:56.200\n I think the next question to ask is,\n\n1:31:56.200 --> 1:31:59.000\n would you want to be long crypto\n\n1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:00.960\n in the event of World War III?\n\n1:32:02.200 --> 1:32:03.720\n What's interesting about that question\n\n1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:05.400\n is that World War III would likely have\n\n1:32:05.400 --> 1:32:07.600\n a significant cyber dimension to it.\n\n1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:10.200\n And I don't want to be 100% in crypto\n\n1:32:10.200 --> 1:32:13.280\n if they crash the internet,\n\n1:32:13.280 --> 1:32:17.720\n which between them, China and Russia might be able to do.\n\n1:32:17.720 --> 1:32:19.280\n That's a fascinating question,\n\n1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:22.040\n whether you want to be holding physical gold\n\n1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:25.360\n or digital gold in the event of World War III.\n\n1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:27.160\n The smart person who studied history\n\n1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:29.760\n definitely wants a bit of both.\n\n1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:33.400\n And so let's imagine World War III\n\n1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:35.960\n has a very, very severe cyber component\n\n1:32:35.960 --> 1:32:38.640\n to it with high levels of disruption.\n\n1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:43.480\n Yeah, you'd be glad of the old shiny stuff at that point.\n\n1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:47.040\n So diversification still seems like\n\n1:32:47.040 --> 1:32:52.040\n the most important truth of financial history.\n\n1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:53.520\n And what is crypto?\n\n1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:56.600\n It's just this wonderful new source of diversification,\n\n1:32:56.600 --> 1:32:59.800\n but you'd be nuts to be 100% in Bitcoin.\n\n1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:02.040\n I mean, I have some friends\n\n1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:04.040\n who are probably quite close to that.\n\n1:33:04.040 --> 1:33:05.360\n Close to 100%, yeah.\n\n1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:10.360\n I'd mar the balls of steel.\n\n1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:16.880\n Yeah, in whatever way that balls of steel takes form.\n\n1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:20.120\n You mentioned smart contracts.\n\n1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:21.760\n What are your thoughts about,\n\n1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:23.640\n in the context of the history of money,\n\n1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:25.640\n about Ethereum, about smart contracts,\n\n1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:30.640\n about kind of more systematic at scale\n\n1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:33.460\n formalization of agreements between humans?\n\n1:33:33.460 --> 1:33:38.460\n Well, I think it must be the case\n\n1:33:40.580 --> 1:33:45.580\n that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant.\n\n1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:51.860\n That when we are confronted with pages and pages\n\n1:33:51.860 --> 1:33:53.820\n and pages and pages of small prints,\n\n1:33:55.340 --> 1:33:58.060\n we're seeing some manifestation\n\n1:33:58.060 --> 1:34:01.180\n of the late stage regulatory state.\n\n1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:03.340\n The transaction itself is quite simple.\n\n1:34:04.700 --> 1:34:08.460\n And most of the verbiage is just ass covering by regulators.\n\n1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:11.360\n So I think the smart contract,\n\n1:34:12.380 --> 1:34:16.020\n although I'm sure lawyers will email me\n\n1:34:16.020 --> 1:34:17.700\n and tell me I'm wrong,\n\n1:34:17.700 --> 1:34:20.380\n can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla\n\n1:34:20.380 --> 1:34:24.080\n and maybe not so plain transactions that we want to do\n\n1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.600\n and eliminate yet more intermediaries.\n\n1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:31.940\n That's my kind of working assumption.\n\n1:34:31.940 --> 1:34:36.940\n And given that a lot of financial transactions\n\n1:34:37.900 --> 1:34:41.740\n have the potential at least to be simplified,\n\n1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:45.380\n automated, turned into smart contracts,\n\n1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:48.380\n that's probably where the future goes.\n\n1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:49.820\n I can't see an obvious reason\n\n1:34:49.820 --> 1:34:54.100\n why my range of different financial needs,\n\n1:34:54.100 --> 1:34:56.540\n let's think about insurance, for example,\n\n1:34:56.540 --> 1:35:00.940\n will continue to be met with instruments\n\n1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:04.260\n that in some ways are 100 years old.\n\n1:35:05.580 --> 1:35:08.620\n So I think we're still at an early stage\n\n1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:12.420\n of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline\n\n1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:17.100\n how we take care of all those financial needs that we have,\n\n1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:20.020\n mortgages and insurance leap to mind.\n\n1:35:20.020 --> 1:35:23.380\n Most households are penalized\n\n1:35:23.380 --> 1:35:27.100\n for being financially poorly educated\n\n1:35:27.100 --> 1:35:29.660\n and confronted with oligopolistic\n\n1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:31.620\n financial services providers.\n\n1:35:31.620 --> 1:35:35.740\n So you kind of leave college already in debt.\n\n1:35:35.740 --> 1:35:40.340\n So you start in debt servitude\n\n1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:43.380\n and then you got to somehow lever up\n\n1:35:43.380 --> 1:35:45.260\n to buy a home if you can,\n\n1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:47.500\n because everybody's kind of telling you you should do that.\n\n1:35:47.500 --> 1:35:50.380\n So you and your spouse,\n\n1:35:50.380 --> 1:35:53.100\n you are getting even more leveraged\n\n1:35:53.100 --> 1:35:57.400\n and your long one asset class called real estate,\n\n1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:59.540\n which is super illiquid.\n\n1:35:59.540 --> 1:36:03.980\n I mean, already I'm crying inside at the thought\n\n1:36:03.980 --> 1:36:07.540\n of describing so many households financial predicament\n\n1:36:07.540 --> 1:36:09.060\n in that way, and I'm not done with them yet\n\n1:36:09.060 --> 1:36:10.660\n because, oh, by the way,\n\n1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:13.180\n there's all this insurance you have to take out\n\n1:36:13.180 --> 1:36:15.380\n and here are the providers that are willing to insure you\n\n1:36:15.380 --> 1:36:17.740\n and here are the premiums you're gonna be paying,\n\n1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:19.280\n which are kind of presented to you.\n\n1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.220\n That's your car insurance, that's your home insurance.\n\n1:36:22.220 --> 1:36:23.820\n And if you're here, it's the earthquake insurance.\n\n1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:26.460\n And pretty soon you're just bleeding money\n\n1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:30.940\n in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage lender,\n\n1:36:30.940 --> 1:36:35.620\n to the insurer, to all the other people that lent you money.\n\n1:36:35.620 --> 1:36:38.460\n And let's look at your balance sheet, it sucks.\n\n1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:41.220\n There's this great big chunk of real estate\n\n1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:43.660\n and what else have you really got on there?\n\n1:36:43.660 --> 1:36:45.340\n And the other side is a bunch of debt,\n\n1:36:45.340 --> 1:36:48.340\n which is probably paying too high interest.\n\n1:36:48.340 --> 1:36:52.440\n The typical household in the median kind of range\n\n1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:56.040\n is at the mercy of oligopolistic\n\n1:36:56.040 --> 1:36:57.620\n financial services providers.\n\n1:36:57.620 --> 1:37:01.220\n Go down further in the social scale\n\n1:37:01.220 --> 1:37:03.780\n and people are outside the financial system altogether.\n\n1:37:03.780 --> 1:37:07.520\n And those poor folks have to rely on bank notes\n\n1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:10.940\n and informal lending with huge punitive rates.\n\n1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:12.100\n We have to do better than this.\n\n1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:15.300\n This has to be improved upon.\n\n1:37:15.300 --> 1:37:17.380\n And I think what's exciting about our time\n\n1:37:17.380 --> 1:37:20.220\n is that technology now exists that didn't exist\n\n1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:22.660\n when I wrote The Ascent of Money to solve these problems.\n\n1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:25.260\n When I wrote The Ascent of Money, which was in 2008,\n\n1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:30.380\n you couldn't really solve the problem I've just described.\n\n1:37:30.380 --> 1:37:31.620\n Certainly you couldn't solve it\n\n1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:32.980\n with something like microfinance.\n\n1:37:32.980 --> 1:37:35.760\n That was obviously not viable.\n\n1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:38.100\n The interest rates were high,\n\n1:37:38.100 --> 1:37:42.020\n the transaction costs were crazy, but now we have solutions\n\n1:37:42.020 --> 1:37:43.980\n and the solutions are extremely exciting.\n\n1:37:43.980 --> 1:37:46.140\n So FinTech is this great force for good\n\n1:37:46.140 --> 1:37:48.820\n that brings people into the financial system\n\n1:37:48.820 --> 1:37:50.900\n and reduces transaction costs.\n\n1:37:50.900 --> 1:37:53.220\n Crypto is part of it, but it's just part of it.\n\n1:37:53.220 --> 1:37:55.880\n There's a much broader story of FinTech going on here\n\n1:37:55.880 --> 1:38:00.640\n where suddenly you get financial services on your phone,\n\n1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:03.480\n don't cost nearly as much as they did\n\n1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.100\n when there had to be a bricks and mortar building\n\n1:38:05.100 --> 1:38:08.220\n on main street that you kind of went humbly\n\n1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:10.420\n and beseeched to lend you money.\n\n1:38:10.420 --> 1:38:11.620\n I'm excited about that\n\n1:38:11.620 --> 1:38:14.740\n because it seems to me very socially transformative.\n\n1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:17.660\n I'll give you one other example of what's great.\n\n1:38:17.660 --> 1:38:21.580\n The people who really get sculpted in our financial system\n\n1:38:21.580 --> 1:38:25.800\n are senders and receivers of remittances,\n\n1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:29.060\n which are often amongst the poorest families in the world.\n\n1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:32.380\n The people who are like my wife's family in East Africa\n\n1:38:32.380 --> 1:38:34.500\n really kind of hand to mouth.\n\n1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:36.460\n And if you send money to East Africa\n\n1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:39.060\n or the Philippines or Central America,\n\n1:38:39.060 --> 1:38:41.840\n it's the transaction costs are awful.\n\n1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:44.680\n I'm talking to you, Western Union.\n\n1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:47.680\n We're going to solve that problem.\n\n1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:48.760\n So 10 years from now,\n\n1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:51.080\n the transaction costs will just be negligible\n\n1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:53.160\n and the money will go to the people who need it\n\n1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:55.760\n rather than to rent seeking financial institutions.\n\n1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:57.520\n So I'm on the side of the revolution with this\n\n1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:01.240\n because I think the incumbent financial institutions globally\n\n1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.280\n are doing a pretty terrible job\n\n1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:08.040\n and middle class and lower class families lose out.\n\n1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:10.040\n And thankfully, technologically,\n\n1:39:10.040 --> 1:39:11.960\n technology allows us to fix this.\n\n1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:14.120\n Yeah, so FinTech can remove a lot of inefficiencies\n\n1:39:14.120 --> 1:39:15.160\n in the system.\n\n1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:16.800\n I'm super excited myself,\n\n1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:20.000\n maybe as a machine learning person in data oracles.\n\n1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:24.000\n So converting a lot of our physical world into data\n\n1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:27.160\n and have smart contracts on top of that.\n\n1:39:27.160 --> 1:39:30.520\n So that no longer is there's this fuzziness\n\n1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:34.560\n about what is the concrete nature of the agreements.\n\n1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.760\n You can tie your agreement to weather.\n\n1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:40.760\n You can tie your agreement to the behavior\n\n1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:44.080\n of certain kinds of financial systems.\n\n1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:47.480\n You can tie your behavior to, I don't know,\n\n1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:48.560\n I mean, all kinds of things.\n\n1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:50.080\n You can connect it to the body\n\n1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:53.800\n in terms of human sensory information.\n\n1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:56.120\n Like you can make an agreement\n\n1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:01.120\n that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month,\n\n1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:03.360\n you're going to pay me $1,000 or something like that.\n\n1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:04.200\n I don't know.\n\n1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:06.760\n It's a stupid example, but it's not going to happen.\n\n1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:08.200\n It's a good example, but it's not\n\n1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.840\n because like you can create all kinds of services\n\n1:40:10.840 --> 1:40:11.680\n on top of that.\n\n1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:15.120\n You can just create all kinds of interesting applications\n\n1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:18.800\n that completely revolutionize how humans transact.\n\n1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:24.800\n I think, of course, we don't want to create a world\n\n1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:29.640\n of Chinese style social credit\n\n1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.480\n in which our behavior becomes so transparent\n\n1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:36.960\n to providers of financial services,\n\n1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:41.960\n particularly insurers that when I try to go into the pub,\n\n1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:44.920\n I'm stopped from doing so.\n\n1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:47.240\n Every time you take a drink, your insurance goes up.\n\n1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:51.400\n Right, or my credit card wouldn't work\n\n1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:56.160\n in certain restaurants because they serve ribeye steak.\n\n1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:59.160\n I fear that world because I see it being built in China.\n\n1:40:59.160 --> 1:41:02.960\n And we must at all costs make sure\n\n1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:07.560\n that the Western world has something distinctive to offer.\n\n1:41:07.560 --> 1:41:09.920\n It can't just be, oh, it's the same as in China.\n\n1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:13.600\n Only the data go to five tech companies\n\n1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.920\n rather than to Xi Jinping.\n\n1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:21.720\n So I think that the way we need to steer this world\n\n1:41:21.720 --> 1:41:26.720\n is in the way that our data are by default\n\n1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:31.120\n are by default vaulted on our devices\n\n1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:35.320\n and we choose when to release the data\n\n1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:38.000\n rather than the default setting\n\n1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.080\n being that the data are available.\n\n1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:41.120\n That's important, I think,\n\n1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:43.040\n because it was one of the biggest mistakes\n\n1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:45.440\n of the evolution of the internet\n\n1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:50.080\n that in a way the default was to let our data be plundered.\n\n1:41:50.080 --> 1:41:51.160\n It's hard to undo that,\n\n1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:56.080\n but I think we can at least create a new regime\n\n1:41:56.080 --> 1:41:59.680\n that in future makes privacy default\n\n1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:02.120\n rather than open access default.\n\n1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:07.960\n In the book, Doom, The Politics of Catastrophe,\n\n1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:11.880\n your newest book, you describe wars, pandemics\n\n1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:14.280\n and the terrible disasters in human history,\n\n1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:17.920\n which stands out to you as the worst\n\n1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:21.000\n in terms of how much it shook the world\n\n1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.280\n and the human spirit.\n\n1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:27.280\n I am glad I was not around in the mid 14th century\n\n1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:31.160\n when the bubonic plague swept across Eurasia.\n\n1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:36.960\n As far as we can see, that was history's worst pandemic.\n\n1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:38.920\n Maybe there was a comparably bad one\n\n1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:42.280\n in the reign of the emperor Justinian,\n\n1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:45.840\n but there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad.\n\n1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:50.040\n And the more we learn about the 14th century,\n\n1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.360\n the more we realize that it really was across Eurasia\n\n1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:57.720\n and the mortality was 30% in some places,\n\n1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:00.480\n 50% in some places higher.\n\n1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:02.760\n There were whole towns that were just emptied.\n\n1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:06.520\n And when one reads about the Black Death,\n\n1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:11.520\n it's an unimaginable nightmare of death\n\n1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:17.040\n and madness in the death with flagellant orders\n\n1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:18.800\n wandering from town to town.\n\n1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:22.760\n Town to town seeking to ward off divine retribution\n\n1:43:22.760 --> 1:43:24.840\n by flogging themselves,\n\n1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:27.000\n people turning on the local Jewish communities\n\n1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:28.920\n as if it's somehow their fault.\n\n1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:32.400\n That must have been a nightmarish time.\n\n1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:36.600\n If you ask me for an also random runner up,\n\n1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:41.600\n it would be World War II in Eastern Europe.\n\n1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:46.280\n And in many ways, it might have been worse\n\n1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.400\n because for a medieval peasant,\n\n1:43:50.400 --> 1:43:53.760\n the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution\n\n1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:55.320\n must have been overpowering.\n\n1:43:56.800 --> 1:43:59.400\n In the mid 20th century,\n\n1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:04.200\n you knew that this was manmade murder\n\n1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:06.960\n on a massive industrial scale.\n\n1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:10.560\n If one reads Grossman's Life and Fate,\n\n1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:12.880\n just to take one example,\n\n1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:15.320\n one enters a hellscape\n\n1:44:15.320 --> 1:44:20.320\n that it's extremely hard to imagine oneself in.\n\n1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:24.800\n So these are two of the great disasters of human history.\n\n1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:27.360\n And if we did have a time machine,\n\n1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:30.240\n if one really were able to transport people back\n\n1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:34.800\n and give them a glimpse of these times,\n\n1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:37.400\n I think the post traumatic stress would be enormous.\n\n1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:39.680\n People would come back from those trips\n\n1:44:39.680 --> 1:44:44.400\n even if it was a one day excursion with guaranteed survival\n\n1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:47.160\n in a state of utter shock.\n\n1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.200\n You often explore counterfactual and hypothetical history,\n\n1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:53.680\n which is a fascinating thing to do,\n\n1:44:53.680 --> 1:44:55.840\n sometimes to a controversial degree.\n\n1:44:57.200 --> 1:44:59.720\n And again, you walk through that fire gracefully.\n\n1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:06.640\n So let me ask maybe about World War II or in general,\n\n1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:12.360\n what key moments in history of the 20th century\n\n1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:15.840\n do you think if something else happened at those moments,\n\n1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:18.200\n we could have avoided some of the big atrocities,\n\n1:45:18.200 --> 1:45:21.160\n Stalin's Baltimore, Hitler's Holocaust,\n\n1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:22.840\n Mao's Great Chinese Famine?\n\n1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:28.600\n The great turning point in world history\n\n1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:32.880\n is August the 2nd, 1914,\n\n1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:38.560\n when the British cabinet decides to intervene\n\n1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:43.600\n and what would have been a European war\n\n1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:46.000\n becomes a world war.\n\n1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:47.320\n And with British intervention,\n\n1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:50.640\n it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict.\n\n1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:53.240\n So very early in my career,\n\n1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:55.720\n I became very preoccupied with the deliberations\n\n1:45:55.720 --> 1:46:00.720\n on that day and the surprising decision\n\n1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:04.520\n that a liberal cabinet took to go to war,\n\n1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:06.480\n which you might not have bet on that morning\n\n1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:10.680\n because there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members\n\n1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:12.960\n who would be disinclined and only a minority,\n\n1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:15.280\n including Winston Churchill, who wanted to go to war.\n\n1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:16.760\n So that's one turning point.\n\n1:46:16.760 --> 1:46:20.160\n I often wish I could get my time machine working\n\n1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:22.640\n and go back and say, wait, stop.\n\n1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:24.320\n Just think about what you're going to do.\n\n1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:28.920\n And by the way, let me show you a video of Europe in 1918.\n\n1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:29.800\n So that's one.\n\n1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:31.520\n Can we linger on that one?\n\n1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:36.520\n That one, a lot of people push back on you\n\n1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:39.400\n because it's so difficult.\n\n1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.760\n So the idea is, if I could try to summarize,\n\n1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:46.440\n and you're the first person that made me think\n\n1:46:46.440 --> 1:46:50.400\n about this very uncomfortable thought,\n\n1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:54.360\n which is the ideas in World War I,\n\n1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.600\n it would be a better world if Britain stayed out of the war\n\n1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:00.520\n and Germany won.\n\n1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:01.360\n Right.\n\n1:47:03.880 --> 1:47:06.960\n Thinking now in retrospect at the whole story\n\n1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:08.000\n of the 20th century,\n\n1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:11.960\n thinking about Stalin's rule of 30 years,\n\n1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:14.560\n thinking about Hitler's rise to power\n\n1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.360\n and the atrocities of the Holocaust,\n\n1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:21.360\n but also like you said on the Eastern front,\n\n1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:25.960\n the death of tens of millions of people through the war\n\n1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:28.600\n and also sort of the political prisoners\n\n1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:30.680\n and the suffering connected to communism,\n\n1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.040\n connected to fascism, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:47:34.040 --> 1:47:37.880\n Well, that's one heck of an example\n\n1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:39.480\n of why you're just like fearless\n\n1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:42.000\n in this particular style\n\n1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.120\n of exploring counterfactual history.\n\n1:47:44.120 --> 1:47:47.360\n So can you elaborate on that idea\n\n1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:50.200\n and maybe why this was such an important day\n\n1:47:50.200 --> 1:47:52.160\n in human history?\n\n1:47:52.160 --> 1:47:55.080\n This argument was central to my book, The Pity of War.\n\n1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:58.360\n I also did an essay in virtual history about this\n\n1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:01.160\n and it's always amused me that from around that time,\n\n1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:03.200\n I began to be called a conservative historian\n\n1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:05.520\n because it's actually a very left wing argument.\n\n1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:07.880\n The people in 1914 who thought Britain should stay\n\n1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:10.520\n at the war were the left of the Labour Party,\n\n1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:12.920\n who split to become the Independent Labour Party.\n\n1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:16.080\n What would have happened?\n\n1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:19.920\n Well, first of all, Britain was not ready for war in 1914.\n\n1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:21.080\n There had not been conscription.\n\n1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:23.080\n The army was tiny.\n\n1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:25.600\n So Britain had failed to deter Germany.\n\n1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:27.000\n The Germans took the decision\n\n1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.960\n that they could risk going through Belgium\n\n1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:34.520\n using the Schlieffen Plan to fight their two front war.\n\n1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:37.520\n They calculated that Britain's intervention\n\n1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.480\n would either not happen or not matter.\n\n1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:46.080\n If Britain had been strategically committed\n\n1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:48.920\n to preventing Germany winning a war in Europe,\n\n1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:51.240\n they should have introduced conscription 10 years before,\n\n1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:53.440\n had a meaningful land army\n\n1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:55.760\n and that would have deterred the Germans.\n\n1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.280\n So the Liberal government provided the worst of both worlds,\n\n1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.320\n a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene\n\n1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:05.440\n that the public didn't know about.\n\n1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:07.600\n In fact, much of the Liberal Party didn't know about,\n\n1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.520\n but without really the means\n\n1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:11.280\n to make that intervention effective,\n\n1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:13.400\n a tiny army with just a few divisions.\n\n1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:16.040\n So it was perfectly reasonable to argue\n\n1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:19.680\n as a number of people did on August the 2nd, 1914,\n\n1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:21.560\n that Britain should not intervene.\n\n1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:23.520\n After all, Britain had not immediately intervened\n\n1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:27.160\n against the French Revolutionary armies back in the 1790s.\n\n1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:30.440\n It had played an offshore role, ultimately intervening,\n\n1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:32.800\n but not immediately intervening.\n\n1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:35.280\n If Britain had stayed out,\n\n1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:38.400\n I don't think that France would have collapsed immediately\n\n1:49:38.400 --> 1:49:40.360\n as it had in 1870.\n\n1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.360\n The French held up remarkably well\n\n1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:44.400\n to catastrophic casualties\n\n1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:47.760\n in the first six months of the First World War.\n\n1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:52.360\n But by 1916, I don't see how France could have kept going\n\n1:49:52.360 --> 1:49:54.840\n if Britain had not joined the war.\n\n1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.920\n And I think the war would have been over perhaps\n\n1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:59.160\n at some point in 1916.\n\n1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:00.520\n We know that Germany's aims\n\n1:50:00.520 --> 1:50:02.320\n would have been significantly limited\n\n1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:04.480\n because they would have needed to keep Britain out.\n\n1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:06.160\n If they'd succeeded in keeping Britain out,\n\n1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:07.680\n they'd have had to keep Britain out.\n\n1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:09.160\n And the way to keep Britain out was obviously\n\n1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:11.880\n not to make any annexation of Belgium,\n\n1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:14.080\n to limit German war aims,\n\n1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.520\n particularly to limit them to Eastern Europe.\n\n1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:19.120\n And from Britain's point of view, what was not to like?\n\n1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:21.600\n So the Russian Empire is defeated\n\n1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:23.280\n along with France.\n\n1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:27.520\n What does that really change?\n\n1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:29.800\n If the Germans are sensible\n\n1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:33.840\n and we can see what this might've looked like,\n\n1:50:33.840 --> 1:50:35.880\n they focus on Eastern Europe,\n\n1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:38.440\n they take chunks of the Russian Empire,\n\n1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:40.600\n perhaps they create as they did\n\n1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:44.400\n in the piece of Brest Litovsk,\n\n1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:47.120\n an independent or quasi independent Poland.\n\n1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:49.400\n In no way does that pose a threat to the British Empire.\n\n1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:52.080\n In fact, it's a good thing.\n\n1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:54.400\n Britain never had had a particularly good relationship\n\n1:50:54.400 --> 1:50:56.080\n with the Russian Empire after all.\n\n1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:00.280\n The key point here is that the Germany that emerges\n\n1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:05.000\n from victory in 1916 has a kind of European union.\n\n1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:09.080\n It's the dominant power of an enlarged Germany\n\n1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:12.880\n with a significant middle Europa,\n\n1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:13.800\n whatever you want to call it,\n\n1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:17.360\n customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries,\n\n1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:20.240\n including one suspects, Austria, Hungary.\n\n1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:27.120\n That is a very different world from the world of 1917, 18.\n\n1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:31.040\n The protraction of the war for a further two years,\n\n1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:33.200\n it's globalization,\n\n1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:35.600\n which Britain's intervention made inevitable.\n\n1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:39.400\n As Philip Zelikow showed in his recent book\n\n1:51:39.400 --> 1:51:43.480\n on the failure to make peace in 1916,\n\n1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:46.040\n Woodrow Wilson tried and failed to intervene\n\n1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.720\n and broker a peace in 1916.\n\n1:51:47.720 --> 1:51:50.800\n So I'm not the only counterfactualist here.\n\n1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:53.400\n The extension of the war for a further two years\n\n1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:56.120\n with escalating slaughter, the death toll rose\n\n1:51:56.120 --> 1:52:00.480\n because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater.\n\n1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:04.400\n That's what condemns us to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\n1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:08.040\n And it's what condemns us ultimately to Nazism\n\n1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:13.760\n because it's out of the experience of defeat in 1918\n\n1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:15.600\n as Hitler makes clear in Mein Kampf\n\n1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:19.320\n that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm.\n\n1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:23.920\n Take out those additional years of war\n\n1:52:23.920 --> 1:52:26.160\n and Hitler's just a failed artist.\n\n1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:31.160\n It's the end of the war that turns him into the demagogue.\n\n1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:34.920\n You asked what are the things\n\n1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:38.880\n that avoid the totalitarian states.\n\n1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:39.720\n As I've said,\n\n1:52:39.720 --> 1:52:42.840\n British nonintervention for me is the most plausible\n\n1:52:42.840 --> 1:52:45.760\n and it takes out all of that malignant history\n\n1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:48.280\n that follows from the Bolshevik revolution.\n\n1:52:48.280 --> 1:52:51.000\n It's very hard for me to see how Lenin gets anywhere\n\n1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.320\n if the war is over.\n\n1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:55.280\n That looks like the opportunity\n\n1:52:55.280 --> 1:52:59.800\n for the constitutional elements,\n\n1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:02.600\n the liberal elements in Russia.\n\n1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:05.800\n There are other moments at which you can imagine history\n\n1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:07.480\n taking a different path.\n\n1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:11.160\n If the provisional government in Russia\n\n1:53:11.160 --> 1:53:12.480\n had been more ruthless,\n\n1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:15.960\n it was very lenient towards the Bolsheviks,\n\n1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.600\n but if it had just rounded them up\n\n1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:19.280\n and shot the Bolshevik leadership,\n\n1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:23.520\n that would have certainly cut the Bolshevik revolution off.\n\n1:53:23.520 --> 1:53:27.720\n One looks back on the conduct of the Russian liberals\n\n1:53:27.720 --> 1:53:30.720\n with the kind of despair at their failure\n\n1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:33.240\n to see the scale of the threat that they faced\n\n1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:35.280\n and the ruthlessness that the Bolshevik leadership\n\n1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:38.720\n would evince. There's a counterfactual in Germany,\n\n1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:40.520\n which is interesting.\n\n1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:43.480\n I think the Weimar Republic destroyed itself\n\n1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:48.480\n in two disastrous economic calamities,\n\n1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:50.520\n the inflation and then the deflation.\n\n1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:53.320\n It's difficult for me to imagine Hitler\n\n1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:56.760\n getting to be Reich Chancellor\n\n1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:59.680\n without those huge economic disasters.\n\n1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:02.400\n So another part of my early work explored\n\n1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:06.360\n alternative policy options that the German Republic,\n\n1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:08.360\n the Weimar Republic might have pursued.\n\n1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:12.760\n There are other contingencies that spring to mind.\n\n1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:16.440\n In 1936 or 38, I think more plausibly 38,\n\n1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:19.840\n Britain should have gone to war.\n\n1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:21.640\n The great mistake was Munich.\n\n1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.560\n Hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938,\n\n1:54:27.560 --> 1:54:30.120\n because remember, he didn't have Russia squared away\n\n1:54:30.120 --> 1:54:31.640\n as he would in 1938.\n\n1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:33.880\n As he would in 1939.\n\n1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:38.880\n Chamberlain's mistake was to fold instead of going for war\n\n1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:41.160\n as Churchill rightly saw.\n\n1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:44.360\n And there was a magical opportunity there\n\n1:54:44.360 --> 1:54:45.520\n that would have played into the hands\n\n1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:48.160\n of the German military opposition and conservatives\n\n1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:52.960\n to snuff Hitler out over Czechoslovakia.\n\n1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:53.800\n I could go on.\n\n1:54:53.800 --> 1:54:58.800\n The point is that history is not some inexorable narrative,\n\n1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:01.200\n which can only end one way.\n\n1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:03.720\n It's a garden of forking paths.\n\n1:55:03.720 --> 1:55:08.280\n And many, many junctions in the road,\n\n1:55:09.160 --> 1:55:11.880\n there were choices that could have averted\n\n1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:14.360\n the calamities of the mid 20th century.\n\n1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.360\n I have to ask you about this moment,\n\n1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:18.080\n before you said I could go on,\n\n1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:20.560\n this moment of Chamberlain and Hitler,\n\n1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:24.280\n snuff Hitler out in terms of Czechoslovakia.\n\n1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:29.040\n And we'll return to the book Doom on this point.\n\n1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:32.280\n What does it take to be a great leader\n\n1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:33.640\n in the room with Hitler,\n\n1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:38.640\n or in the same time and space as Hitler,\n\n1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:42.240\n to snuff him out, to make the right decisions?\n\n1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.760\n So it sounds like you put quite a bit of a blame\n\n1:55:46.760 --> 1:55:49.040\n on the man, Chamberlain,\n\n1:55:49.040 --> 1:55:53.360\n and give credit to somebody like a Churchill.\n\n1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:54.280\n So what is the difference?\n\n1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.400\n Where's that line?\n\n1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:58.920\n You've also written a book about Henry Kissinger,\n\n1:55:58.920 --> 1:56:01.200\n who's an interesting sort of person\n\n1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:04.800\n that's been throughout many difficult decisions\n\n1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.200\n in the games of power.\n\n1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:08.520\n So what does it take to be a great leader in that moment?\n\n1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:10.640\n That particular moment, sorry to keep talking,\n\n1:56:10.640 --> 1:56:12.280\n is fascinating to me,\n\n1:56:12.280 --> 1:56:15.760\n because it feels like it's man on man conversations\n\n1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:17.680\n that define history.\n\n1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:19.600\n Well, Hitler was bluffing.\n\n1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:21.760\n He really wasn't ready for war in 1938.\n\n1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:25.720\n The German economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938.\n\n1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:30.720\n And Chamberlain made a fundamental miscalculation\n\n1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.360\n along with his advisors,\n\n1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:33.720\n because it wasn't all Chamberlain.\n\n1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:38.720\n He was in many ways articulating the establishment view.\n\n1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:41.480\n And I tried to show in a book called War of the World\n\n1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:42.800\n how that establishment worked.\n\n1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:46.160\n It extended through the BBC, into the aristocracy,\n\n1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:47.000\n to Oxford.\n\n1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:48.080\n There was an establishment view.\n\n1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:49.800\n Chamberlain personified it.\n\n1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:53.080\n Churchill was seen as a warmonger.\n\n1:56:53.080 --> 1:56:56.280\n He was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938.\n\n1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:59.080\n But what is it that Chamberlain gets wrong?\n\n1:56:59.080 --> 1:57:00.760\n Because it's conceptual.\n\n1:57:00.760 --> 1:57:03.680\n Chamberlain is persuaded that Britain has to play for time\n\n1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:06.800\n because Britain is not ready for war in 1938.\n\n1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:09.800\n He fails to see that the time that he gets,\n\n1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:13.520\n that he buys at Munich is also available to Hitler.\n\n1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:15.200\n Everybody gets the time\n\n1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:17.000\n and Hitler's able to do much more with it\n\n1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.840\n because Hitler strikes the pact with Stalin\n\n1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:23.640\n that guarantees that Germany can fight a war\n\n1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:25.920\n on one front in 1939.\n\n1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:26.840\n What does Chamberlain do?\n\n1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:28.760\n Build some more aircraft.\n\n1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:31.320\n So the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement\n\n1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:32.800\n was to play for time.\n\n1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:34.120\n I mean, they knew war was coming,\n\n1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:35.080\n but they were playing for time,\n\n1:57:35.080 --> 1:57:39.160\n not realizing that Hitler got the time too.\n\n1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:42.000\n And after he partitioned Czechoslovakia,\n\n1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.760\n he was in a much stronger position,\n\n1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:45.400\n not least because of all the resources\n\n1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:50.400\n that they were able to plunder from Czechoslovakia.\n\n1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:52.720\n So that was the conceptual mistake.\n\n1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:57.200\n Churchill played an heroic role in pointing out\n\n1:57:58.320 --> 1:58:00.960\n this mistake and predicting accurately\n\n1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:04.080\n that it would lead to war on worse terms.\n\n1:58:04.080 --> 1:58:05.680\n What does it take?\n\n1:58:05.680 --> 1:58:10.680\n It takes a distinct courage to be unpopular.\n\n1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:13.640\n And Churchill was deeply unpopular at that point.\n\n1:58:13.640 --> 1:58:16.480\n People would listen to him in the House of Commons\n\n1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:17.760\n in silence.\n\n1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:21.920\n On one occasion, Lady Astor shouted, rubbish.\n\n1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:25.200\n So he went through a period of being hated on.\n\n1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:29.080\n The other thing that made Churchill a formidable leader\n\n1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.800\n was that he always applied history to the problem.\n\n1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:35.080\n And that's why he gets it right.\n\n1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:37.360\n He sees the historical problem\n\n1:58:37.360 --> 1:58:39.880\n much more clearly than Chamberlain.\n\n1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:44.320\n So I think if you go back to 1938,\n\n1:58:44.320 --> 1:58:45.920\n there's no realistic counterfactual\n\n1:58:45.920 --> 1:58:48.000\n in which Churchill's in government in 1938.\n\n1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:49.800\n You have to have France collapse\n\n1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:51.880\n for Churchill to come into government.\n\n1:58:51.880 --> 1:58:56.880\n But you can certainly imagine a Tory elite\n\n1:58:57.240 --> 1:59:02.240\n that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics.\n\n1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:06.320\n They haven't seen this, I guess, problem of conjecture,\n\n1:59:06.320 --> 1:59:08.880\n to take a phrase from Kissinger,\n\n1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:13.800\n which is that whatever they're doing in postponing the war\n\n1:59:13.800 --> 1:59:16.640\n has the potential to create\n\n1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:18.760\n a worse starting point for the war.\n\n1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:21.920\n It would have been risky in 1938,\n\n1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:23.640\n but it was a way better situation\n\n1:59:23.640 --> 1:59:27.280\n than they ended up with in 1939, a year later.\n\n1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:28.200\n You asked about Kissinger,\n\n1:59:28.200 --> 1:59:31.200\n and I've learned a lot from reading Kissinger\n\n1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:33.960\n and talking to Kissinger since I embarked\n\n1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:37.120\n on writing his biography a great many years ago.\n\n1:59:37.120 --> 1:59:40.640\n So I think one of the most important things I've learned\n\n1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:46.600\n is that you can apply history to contemporary problems.\n\n1:59:46.600 --> 1:59:49.720\n It may be the most important tool that we have\n\n1:59:49.720 --> 1:59:52.800\n in that kind of decision making.\n\n1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:57.440\n You have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously.\n\n1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:03.360\n And in the moment of crisis, you have to take risk.\n\n2:00:03.360 --> 2:00:08.360\n So Kissinger often says in his early work,\n\n2:00:08.400 --> 2:00:12.240\n the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data,\n\n2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:14.520\n but ultimately the decision making\n\n2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:18.480\n that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data.\n\n2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:19.920\n The problem of conjecture is\n\n2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:23.920\n that you could take an action now and incur some cost,\n\n2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:28.720\n an avert disaster, but you'll get no thanks for it\n\n2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:32.120\n because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster.\n\n2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:34.480\n And nobody goes around saying, wasn't it wonderful\n\n2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.240\n how we didn't have another 9 11.\n\n2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:40.760\n On the other hand, you can do nothing,\n\n2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:44.120\n incur no upfront costs and hope for the best.\n\n2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:47.440\n And you might get lucky, the disaster might not happen.\n\n2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:52.440\n That's in a democratic system, the much easier path to take.\n\n2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:59.280\n And I think that the essence of leadership is to be ready\n\n2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:02.000\n to take that upfront cost, avert the disaster\n\n2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:03.960\n and accept that you won't get gratitude.\n\n2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:10.360\n If I may make a comment, an aside about Henry Kissinger.\n\n2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:15.400\n So he, I think at 98 years old currently has still got it.\n\n2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:17.720\n He's brilliant.\n\n2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:19.000\n It's very, very impressive.\n\n2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.280\n I can only hope that my brain has the same durability\n\n2:01:23.280 --> 2:01:26.080\n that his does because it's a formidable intellect\n\n2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:31.080\n and it's still in as sharp form as it was 50 years ago.\n\n2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:34.200\n So you mentioned Eric Schmidt's in his book\n\n2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:37.960\n and he reached out to me that he wanted to do this podcast.\n\n2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:41.320\n And I know Eric Schmidt, I've spoken to him before.\n\n2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:43.160\n I like him a lot, obviously.\n\n2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.160\n So they said, we could do a podcast for 40 minutes\n\n2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:52.640\n with Eric, 40 minutes with Eric and Henry together\n\n2:01:52.640 --> 2:01:54.960\n and 40 minutes with Henry.\n\n2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:58.040\n So those are three different conversations.\n\n2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:00.920\n And I had to like, I had to do some soul searching\n\n2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:02.840\n because I said, fine, 40 minutes with Eric.\n\n2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:04.800\n We'll probably talk many times again.\n\n2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:07.520\n Fine, let's talk about this AI book together\n\n2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:09.240\n for 40 minutes.\n\n2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:12.760\n But I said, what I wrote to them is that I would hate myself\n\n2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:16.640\n if I only have 40 minutes to talk to Henry Kissinger.\n\n2:02:16.640 --> 2:02:18.840\n And so I had to hold my ground, went back and forth\n\n2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:21.160\n and in the end decided to part ways over this.\n\n2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:25.840\n And I sometimes think about this kind of difficult decision\n\n2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:30.840\n in the podcasting space of when do you walk away?\n\n2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:38.960\n Because there's a particular world leader\n\n2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:40.560\n that I've mentioned in the past\n\n2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:43.960\n where the conversation is very likely to happen.\n\n2:02:43.960 --> 2:02:48.960\n And as it happens, those conversations could often be,\n\n2:02:50.760 --> 2:02:53.360\n unfortunately this person only has 30 minutes now.\n\n2:02:53.360 --> 2:02:56.000\n I know we agreed for three hours, but unfortunately,\n\n2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:01.000\n and you have to decide, do I stand my ground on this point?\n\n2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.160\n I suppose that's the thing that journalists\n\n2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:04.520\n have to think about, right?\n\n2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:09.520\n Like, do I hold onto my integrity\n\n2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:11.400\n in whatever form that takes?\n\n2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:12.520\n And do I stay my ground\n\n2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:16.120\n even if I lose a fascinating opportunity?\n\n2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:17.960\n Anyway, it's something I thought about\n\n2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:19.720\n and something I think about.\n\n2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:21.680\n And with Henry Kissinger, I mean,\n\n2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:25.720\n he's had a million amazing conversations in your biography,\n\n2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:27.240\n so it's not like something is lost,\n\n2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:28.880\n but it was still nevertheless to me\n\n2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:30.760\n some soul searching that I had to do\n\n2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:34.560\n as a kind of practice for what to me\n\n2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:36.800\n is a higher stakes conversation.\n\n2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:38.880\n I'll just mention it as Vladimir Putin.\n\n2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:41.720\n I can have a conversation with him\n\n2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:44.400\n unlike any conversation he's ever had,\n\n2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:47.800\n partially because I'm a fluent Russian speaker,\n\n2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:49.600\n partially because I'm messed up in the head\n\n2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:50.880\n in certain kinds of ways that make\n\n2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:52.760\n for an interesting dynamic,\n\n2:03:52.760 --> 2:03:54.400\n because we're both Judo people,\n\n2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:58.560\n we both are certain kinds of human beings\n\n2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.120\n that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation.\n\n2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:05.880\n I have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership.\n\n2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:08.360\n You've, in your book, Doom,\n\n2:04:08.360 --> 2:04:12.320\n have talked about wars, pandemics throughout human history,\n\n2:04:13.320 --> 2:04:18.320\n and in some sense, saying that all of these disasters\n\n2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:20.240\n are manmade.\n\n2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:23.560\n So humans have a role in terms of the magnitude\n\n2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:26.120\n of the effect that they have on human civilization.\n\n2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:30.200\n Without taking cheap political shots,\n\n2:04:30.200 --> 2:04:32.120\n can we talk about COVID 19?\n\n2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:38.040\n How will history remember the COVID 19 pandemic?\n\n2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:39.880\n What were the successes,\n\n2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:44.880\n what were the failures of leadership of man, of humans?\n\n2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:49.560\n Doom was a book that I was planning to write\n\n2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:52.320\n before the pandemic struck.\n\n2:04:52.320 --> 2:04:55.840\n As a history of the future based in large measure\n\n2:04:55.840 --> 2:04:57.680\n on science fiction.\n\n2:04:57.680 --> 2:04:59.400\n It had occurred to me in 2019\n\n2:04:59.400 --> 2:05:02.360\n that I had spent too long not reading science fiction,\n\n2:05:02.360 --> 2:05:07.360\n and so I decided I would liven up my intake\n\n2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:12.040\n by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction.\n\n2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:14.960\n Because history is great at telling you about the perennial\n\n2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.440\n problems of power.\n\n2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:18.800\n Putin is always interesting on history.\n\n2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:21.200\n He's become something of a historian recently\n\n2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:23.720\n with his essays and lectures.\n\n2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:25.480\n But what history is bad at telling you is,\n\n2:05:25.480 --> 2:05:27.960\n well, what will the effects of discontinuity\n\n2:05:27.960 --> 2:05:29.720\n of technology be?\n\n2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:31.360\n And so I thought I need some science fiction\n\n2:05:31.360 --> 2:05:32.480\n to think more about this,\n\n2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:36.360\n because I'm tending to miss the importance\n\n2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:38.160\n of technological discontinuity.\n\n2:05:39.480 --> 2:05:41.280\n If you read a lot of science fiction,\n\n2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:43.800\n you read a lot of plague books,\n\n2:05:43.800 --> 2:05:46.960\n because science fiction writers are really quite fond\n\n2:05:46.960 --> 2:05:48.520\n of the plague scenario.\n\n2:05:48.520 --> 2:05:50.800\n So the world ends in many ways in science fiction,\n\n2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:52.960\n but one of the most popular is the lethal pandemic.\n\n2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:56.680\n So when the first email came to me,\n\n2:05:56.680 --> 2:05:58.160\n I think it was on January the 3rd\n\n2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:00.200\n from my medical friend, Justin Stebbing,\n\n2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:05.200\n funny pneumonia in Wuhan, my antennae began to tingle\n\n2:06:05.440 --> 2:06:08.520\n because it was just like one of those science fiction books\n\n2:06:08.520 --> 2:06:10.440\n that begins in just that moment.\n\n2:06:10.440 --> 2:06:11.880\n It begins in just that way.\n\n2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:18.840\n In a pandemic, as Larry Brilliant,\n\n2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:20.840\n the epidemiologist said many years ago,\n\n2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:25.440\n the key is early detection and early action.\n\n2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:27.480\n That's how you deal with a novel pathogen.\n\n2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:30.760\n And almost no Western country did that.\n\n2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:33.840\n We know it was doable because the Taiwanese\n\n2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:36.760\n and the South Koreans did it, and they did it very well.\n\n2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:40.560\n But really no Western country got this right.\n\n2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:43.160\n Some were unlucky because super spreader events\n\n2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:45.400\n happened earlier than in other countries.\n\n2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:47.720\n Italy was hit very hard very early.\n\n2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:50.280\n For other countries, the real disaster came quite late.\n\n2:06:50.280 --> 2:06:53.240\n Russia, which has only relatively recently\n\n2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:55.240\n had a really bad experience.\n\n2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:59.760\n The lesson for me is quite different from the one\n\n2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:03.120\n that most journalists thought they were learning last year.\n\n2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:05.640\n Most journalists last year thought,\n\n2:07:05.640 --> 2:07:07.680\n Trump is a terrible president.\n\n2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:10.080\n He's saying a lot of crazy things.\n\n2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:12.640\n It's his fault that we have high excess mortality\n\n2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:14.480\n in the United States.\n\n2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:17.440\n The same argument was being made by journalists in Britain,\n\n2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:19.280\n Boris Johnson, dot, dot, dot,\n\n2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:21.680\n Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, dot, dot, dot,\n\n2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:24.960\n even India, Narendra Modi, the same argument.\n\n2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:30.120\n And I think this argument is wrong in a few ways.\n\n2:07:30.120 --> 2:07:34.600\n It's true that the populist leaders said many crazy things,\n\n2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.520\n and broadly speaking gave poor guidance\n\n2:07:37.520 --> 2:07:40.760\n to their populations.\n\n2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:43.520\n But I don't think it's true to say\n\n2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:44.680\n that with different leaders,\n\n2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:46.960\n these countries would have done significantly better\n\n2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:50.440\n if Joe Biden had magically been president a year earlier.\n\n2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:52.440\n I don't think the US would have done much better\n\n2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:55.600\n because the things that caused excess mortality last year\n\n2:07:55.600 --> 2:07:57.080\n weren't presidential decisions.\n\n2:07:57.080 --> 2:08:00.960\n They were utter failure of CDC to provide testing.\n\n2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:03.000\n That definitely wasn't Trump's fault.\n\n2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:04.920\n Scott Gottlieb's book makes that very clear.\n\n2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:06.880\n It's just been published recently.\n\n2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:10.200\n We utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing,\n\n2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:12.600\n which the Koreans did very well.\n\n2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:16.640\n We didn't really quarantine anybody seriously.\n\n2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:19.160\n There was no enforcement of quarantine.\n\n2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:21.120\n And we exposed the elderly to the virus\n\n2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:23.520\n as quickly as possible in elderly care homes.\n\n2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:25.760\n And these things had very little to do\n\n2:08:25.760 --> 2:08:28.120\n with presidential incompetence.\n\n2:08:28.120 --> 2:08:33.120\n So I think leadership is of somewhat marginal importance\n\n2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:34.720\n in a crisis like this,\n\n2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:35.640\n because what you really need\n\n2:08:35.640 --> 2:08:38.120\n is your public health bureaucracy to get it right.\n\n2:08:38.120 --> 2:08:40.560\n And very few Western public health bureaucracies\n\n2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:42.200\n got it right.\n\n2:08:42.200 --> 2:08:45.440\n Could the president have given better leadership?\n\n2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:47.080\n Yes.\n\n2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:49.400\n His correct strategy, however,\n\n2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:52.760\n was to learn from Barack Obama's playbook\n\n2:08:52.760 --> 2:08:55.200\n with the opioid epidemic.\n\n2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:58.040\n The opioid epidemic killed as many people\n\n2:08:58.040 --> 2:09:01.840\n Obama's watch as COVID did on Trump's watch.\n\n2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:03.160\n And it was worse in a sense\n\n2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:05.040\n because it only happened in the US.\n\n2:09:05.040 --> 2:09:06.920\n And each year it killed more people\n\n2:09:06.920 --> 2:09:09.200\n than the year before, over eight years.\n\n2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:12.640\n Nobody to my knowledge has ever seriously blamed Obama\n\n2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:14.760\n for the opioid epidemic.\n\n2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:17.560\n Trump's mistake was to put himself front and center\n\n2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.040\n of the response to claim that he had some unique insight\n\n2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:24.800\n into the pandemic and to say with every passing week,\n\n2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:26.080\n more and more foolish things\n\n2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:29.160\n until even a significant portion of people\n\n2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:32.080\n who'd voted for him in 2016 realized that he'd blown it,\n\n2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:34.160\n which was why he lost the election.\n\n2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:37.920\n The correct strategy was actually to make Mike Pence\n\n2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:41.000\n the pandemic czar and get the hell out of the way.\n\n2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:42.760\n That's what my advice to Trump would have been.\n\n2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:45.720\n In fact, it was in February of last year.\n\n2:09:45.720 --> 2:09:49.000\n So the mistake was to try to lead,\n\n2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:52.560\n but actually leadership in a pandemic\n\n2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:54.080\n is almost a contradiction in terms.\n\n2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.680\n What you really need is your public health bureaucracy\n\n2:09:56.680 --> 2:09:58.360\n not to fuck it up.\n\n2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.440\n And they really, really fucked it up.\n\n2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:02.960\n And that was then all blamed on Trump.\n\n2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:05.400\n Jim Fallows writes a piece in the Atlantic that says,\n\n2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:07.760\n well, being the president's like flying a light aircraft,\n\n2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:09.000\n it's pilot error.\n\n2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.520\n And I read that piece and I thought,\n\n2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:13.160\n does he really after all the years he spent writing\n\n2:10:13.160 --> 2:10:16.160\n think that being president is like flying a light aircraft?\n\n2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:19.160\n I mean, it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft.\n\n2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:22.360\n Being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy\n\n2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:24.400\n with how many different agencies, 60, 70,\n\n2:10:24.400 --> 2:10:25.920\n we've all lost count.\n\n2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:27.720\n And you're surrounded by advisors,\n\n2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:30.600\n at least a quarter of whom are saying, this is a disaster.\n\n2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:31.760\n We have to close the borders.\n\n2:10:31.760 --> 2:10:33.520\n And the others are saying, no, no,\n\n2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:34.680\n we have to keep the economy going.\n\n2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:37.120\n That's what you're running on in November.\n\n2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:39.160\n So being a president in a pandemic\n\n2:10:39.160 --> 2:10:40.960\n is a very unenviable position\n\n2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:45.440\n because you actually can't really determine\n\n2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:47.240\n whether your public health bureaucracy\n\n2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:48.320\n will get it right or not.\n\n2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:50.360\n You don't think to push back on that,\n\n2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:53.120\n just like being Churchill in a war is difficult.\n\n2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:57.040\n So leaving Trump by an aside,\n\n2:10:57.040 --> 2:10:58.920\n what I would love to see from a president\n\n2:10:58.920 --> 2:11:03.240\n is somebody who makes great speeches\n\n2:11:03.240 --> 2:11:06.400\n and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy,\n\n2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:08.200\n the public health bureaucracy,\n\n2:11:08.200 --> 2:11:09.760\n to get their shit together,\n\n2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.560\n to fire certain kinds of people.\n\n2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:15.160\n I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm a big fan of powerful speeches,\n\n2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:17.360\n especially in the modern age with the internet.\n\n2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:19.520\n It can really move people.\n\n2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:23.080\n Instead, the lack of speeches\n\n2:11:23.080 --> 2:11:26.000\n resulted in certain kinds of forces\n\n2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:31.360\n amplifying division over whether to wear masks or not,\n\n2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:35.840\n or it's almost like the public picked some random topic\n\n2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:37.640\n over which to divide themselves.\n\n2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:39.800\n And there was like a complete indecision,\n\n2:11:39.800 --> 2:11:41.360\n which is really what it was,\n\n2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:45.200\n fear of uncertainty materializing itself\n\n2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:46.400\n in some kind of division.\n\n2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:48.960\n And then you almost like busy yourself\n\n2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:50.960\n with the red versus blue politics,\n\n2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:52.480\n as opposed to some, I don't know,\n\n2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:55.900\n FDR type character just stands and say,\n\n2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:59.840\n fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing.\n\n2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:02.680\n We're going to manufacture 5 billion tests.\n\n2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:04.280\n This is what America is great at.\n\n2:12:04.280 --> 2:12:05.600\n We're going to build\n\n2:12:05.600 --> 2:12:08.760\n the greatest testing infrastructure ever built,\n\n2:12:08.760 --> 2:12:12.520\n or something, or even with the vaccine development.\n\n2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:15.240\n But that was what I was about to interject.\n\n2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:18.400\n In a pandemic, the most important thing is the vaccine.\n\n2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:19.520\n If you get that right,\n\n2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:21.560\n then you should be forgiven for much else.\n\n2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:22.400\n And that was the one thing\n\n2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:23.840\n the Trump administration got right,\n\n2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:27.480\n because they went around the bureaucracy\n\n2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:28.840\n with Operation Warp Speed\n\n2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:32.220\n and achieved a really major success.\n\n2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:38.240\n So I think the paradox of the 2020 story\n\n2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:43.040\n in the United States is that the one thing that mattered most\n\n2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:44.800\n the Trump administration got right,\n\n2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:47.600\n and it got so much else wrong\n\n2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:49.080\n that was sort of marginal,\n\n2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:50.980\n that we were left with the impression\n\n2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:53.920\n that Trump had been to blame for the whole disaster,\n\n2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:56.360\n which wasn't really quite right.\n\n2:12:56.360 --> 2:12:57.500\n Sure, it would have been great\n\n2:12:57.500 --> 2:12:59.960\n if we did Operation Warp Speed for testing,\n\n2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:02.920\n but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests.\n\n2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.960\n And this brings me to the question\n\n2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:11.740\n that you raised there of polarization and why that happened.\n\n2:13:11.740 --> 2:13:13.960\n Now, in a book called The Square and the Tower,\n\n2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:17.140\n I argued that it would be very costly for the United States\n\n2:13:17.140 --> 2:13:20.720\n to allow the public sphere to continue to be dominated\n\n2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:22.440\n by a handful of big tech companies,\n\n2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:25.280\n that this ultimately would have more adverse effects\n\n2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:27.400\n than simply contested elections.\n\n2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:31.280\n And I think we saw over the past 18 months\n\n2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:32.800\n just how bad this could be,\n\n2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:37.720\n because the odd thing about this country\n\n2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:42.260\n is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy\n\n2:13:42.260 --> 2:13:44.920\n and about 20% of people refused to get them\n\n2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:49.920\n and still do refuse for reasons that seem best explained\n\n2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:54.200\n in terms of the anti vaccine network,\n\n2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:56.920\n which has been embedded on the internet for a long time,\n\n2:13:56.920 --> 2:13:58.620\n predating the pandemic.\n\n2:13:58.620 --> 2:14:02.480\n Renny DiResta wrote about this pre 2020.\n\n2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:04.760\n And this anti vaccine network has turned out\n\n2:14:04.760 --> 2:14:07.000\n to kill maybe 200,000 Americans\n\n2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:08.220\n who could have been vaccinated,\n\n2:14:08.220 --> 2:14:11.080\n but were persuaded through magical thinking\n\n2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:14.000\n that the vaccine was riskier than the virus.\n\n2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:17.000\n Whereas you don't need to be an epidemiologist,\n\n2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:18.400\n you don't need to be a medical scientist\n\n2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:20.640\n to know that the virus is about two orders\n\n2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:22.760\n of magnitude riskier than the vaccine.\n\n2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:28.880\n So again, leadership could definitely have been better.\n\n2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:32.520\n But the politicization of everything\n\n2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:35.440\n was not Trump's doing alone.\n\n2:14:35.440 --> 2:14:39.760\n It happened because our public sphere has been dominated\n\n2:14:39.760 --> 2:14:43.920\n by a handful of platforms whose business model\n\n2:14:43.920 --> 2:14:46.040\n inherently promotes polarization,\n\n2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:49.080\n inherently promotes fake news and extreme views,\n\n2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:51.380\n because those are the things that get the eyeballs\n\n2:14:51.380 --> 2:14:53.180\n on the screens and sell the ads.\n\n2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:55.120\n I mean, this is now a commonplace.\n\n2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:57.300\n But when one thinks about the cost\n\n2:14:57.300 --> 2:15:01.840\n of allowing this kind of thing to happen,\n\n2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:04.120\n it's now a very high human cost.\n\n2:15:04.120 --> 2:15:06.960\n And we were foolish to leave uncorrected\n\n2:15:06.960 --> 2:15:09.280\n these structural problems in the public sphere\n\n2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:12.800\n that were already very clearly visible in 2016.\n\n2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:16.080\n And you described that, like you mentioned,\n\n2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:18.280\n that there's these networks that are almost like\n\n2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:22.820\n laying dormant, waiting for their time in the sun,\n\n2:15:22.820 --> 2:15:25.360\n and they stepped forward in this case.\n\n2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:30.120\n And that those network effects just disservice catalyst\n\n2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:34.460\n for whatever the bad parts of human nature.\n\n2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:36.360\n I do hope that there's kinds of networks\n\n2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.720\n that emphasize the better angels of our nature,\n\n2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:40.800\n to quote Steven Pinker.\n\n2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:43.560\n It's just clearly, and we know this\n\n2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:46.400\n from all the revelations of the Facebook whistleblower,\n\n2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:49.800\n there is clearly a very clear tension\n\n2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:54.160\n between the business model of a company like Facebook\n\n2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:57.720\n and the public good, and they know that.\n\n2:15:57.720 --> 2:16:00.320\n I just talked to the founder of Instagram.\n\n2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:03.880\n Yes, that's the case, but it's not,\n\n2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:06.280\n from a technology perspective,\n\n2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:08.560\n absolutely true of any kind of social network.\n\n2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:09.900\n I think it's possible to build,\n\n2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:12.080\n actually I think it's not just possible,\n\n2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.020\n I think it's pretty easy if you set that as the goal,\n\n2:16:15.020 --> 2:16:16.840\n to build social networks\n\n2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:20.680\n that don't have these negative effects.\n\n2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:25.680\n Right, but if the business model is we sell ads,\n\n2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:30.200\n and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement,\n\n2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:31.680\n then the algorithm is biased\n\n2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:33.880\n in favor of fake news and extreme views.\n\n2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:36.560\n So it's not the ads, a lot of people blame the ads.\n\n2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:40.360\n The problem I think is the engagement,\n\n2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:42.040\n and the engagement is just the easiest,\n\n2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:43.880\n the dumbest way to sell the ads.\n\n2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:46.120\n I think there's much different metrics\n\n2:16:46.120 --> 2:16:48.760\n that could be used to make a lot more money\n\n2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:50.960\n than the engagement in the long term.\n\n2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:53.440\n It has more to do with planning for the long term,\n\n2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:56.680\n so optimizing the selling of ads\n\n2:16:56.680 --> 2:17:01.680\n to make people happy with themselves in the long term,\n\n2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:06.680\n as opposed to some kind of addicted like dopamine feeling.\n\n2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:09.960\n And so that's, to me that has to do with metrics\n\n2:17:09.960 --> 2:17:11.320\n and measuring things correctly\n\n2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:13.520\n and sort of also creating a culture\n\n2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:16.760\n with what's valued to have difficult conversations\n\n2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:18.400\n about what we're doing with society,\n\n2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:19.560\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:17:19.560 --> 2:17:22.000\n And I think once you have those conversations,\n\n2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:23.800\n this takes us back to the University of Austin,\n\n2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:27.060\n kind of once you have those difficult human conversations,\n\n2:17:27.060 --> 2:17:30.000\n you can design the technology that will actually make\n\n2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.560\n for help people grow,\n\n2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:34.240\n become the best version of themselves,\n\n2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:36.840\n help them be happy in the long term.\n\n2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.880\n What gives you hope about the future?\n\n2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:44.520\n As somebody who studied some of the darker moments\n\n2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:46.960\n of human history, what gives you hope?\n\n2:17:49.200 --> 2:17:50.220\n A couple of things.\n\n2:17:52.540 --> 2:17:56.520\n First of all, the United States\n\n2:17:56.520 --> 2:17:58.860\n has a very unique operating system.\n\n2:17:58.860 --> 2:18:02.200\n Which was very well designed by the founders\n\n2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:03.640\n who'd thought a lot about history\n\n2:18:03.640 --> 2:18:07.880\n and realized it would take quite a novel design\n\n2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:10.920\n to prevent the republic going the way of all republics\n\n2:18:10.920 --> 2:18:12.920\n because republics tend to end up as tyrannies\n\n2:18:12.920 --> 2:18:14.980\n for reasons that were well established\n\n2:18:14.980 --> 2:18:16.920\n by the time of the Renaissance.\n\n2:18:16.920 --> 2:18:20.680\n And it gives me hope that this design has worked very well\n\n2:18:20.680 --> 2:18:25.580\n and withstood an enormous stress test in the last year.\n\n2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:30.580\n I became an American in 2018, I think one of the most\n\n2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:34.440\n important features of this operating system\n\n2:18:34.440 --> 2:18:37.680\n is that it is the magnet for talent.\n\n2:18:38.860 --> 2:18:43.860\n Here we sit, part of the immigration story\n\n2:18:45.640 --> 2:18:50.040\n in a darkened room with funny accents.\n\n2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:54.480\n A Scot and a Russian walk into a recording studio\n\n2:18:54.480 --> 2:18:58.000\n and talk about America, it's very much like a joke.\n\n2:18:58.000 --> 2:18:59.800\n And Elon's a South African and so on,\n\n2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:00.760\n and Teal is a German.\n\n2:19:00.760 --> 2:19:03.760\n And we're extraordinarily fortunate\n\n2:19:03.760 --> 2:19:06.000\n that the natives let us come and play\n\n2:19:07.140 --> 2:19:09.760\n and play in a way that we could not\n\n2:19:09.760 --> 2:19:12.040\n in our countries of birth.\n\n2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:14.360\n And as long as the United States continues\n\n2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:18.760\n to exploit that superpower, that it is the talent magnet,\n\n2:19:18.760 --> 2:19:20.760\n then it should out innovate\n\n2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:24.300\n the totalitarian competition every time.\n\n2:19:24.300 --> 2:19:29.300\n So that's one reason for being an optimist.\n\n2:19:30.460 --> 2:19:33.200\n Another reason, and it's quite a historical reason\n\n2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:34.740\n as you would expect from me.\n\n2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:39.040\n Another reason that I'm optimistic\n\n2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:44.040\n is that my kids give me a great deal of hope.\n\n2:19:45.080 --> 2:19:48.720\n They range in age from 27 down to four,\n\n2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:52.760\n but each of them in their different way\n\n2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:57.760\n seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours\n\n2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:03.800\n without losing contact with that culture\n\n2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:08.080\n and civilization that I hold dear.\n\n2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:10.040\n I don't want to live in the metaverse\n\n2:20:10.040 --> 2:20:12.660\n as Mark Zuckerberg imagines it.\n\n2:20:12.660 --> 2:20:14.940\n To me, that's a kind of ghastly hell.\n\n2:20:15.920 --> 2:20:20.920\n I think Western civilization is the best civilization.\n\n2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:23.860\n And I think that almost all the truths\n\n2:20:23.860 --> 2:20:26.400\n about the human condition can be found\n\n2:20:27.440 --> 2:20:32.440\n in Western literature, art, and music.\n\n2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:36.960\n And I think also that the civilization\n\n2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:38.960\n that produced the scientific revolution\n\n2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:42.840\n has produced the great problem solving tool\n\n2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:44.640\n that eluded the other civilizations\n\n2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:47.480\n that never really cracked science.\n\n2:20:47.480 --> 2:20:50.720\n And what gives me hope is that\n\n2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:53.600\n despite all the temptations and distractions\n\n2:20:53.600 --> 2:20:57.440\n that their generation had to contend with,\n\n2:20:57.440 --> 2:20:58.920\n my children in their different ways\n\n2:20:58.920 --> 2:21:03.040\n have found their way to literature\n\n2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:08.040\n and to art and to music, and they are civilized.\n\n2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.040\n And I don't claim much of the credit for that,\n\n2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:15.160\n I've done my best,\n\n2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:17.880\n but I think it's deeply encouraging\n\n2:21:17.880 --> 2:21:21.580\n that they found their way to the things\n\n2:21:21.580 --> 2:21:25.200\n that I think are indispensable for a happy life,\n\n2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:26.560\n a fulfilled life.\n\n2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:29.120\n Nobody, I think, can be truly fulfilled\n\n2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:32.100\n if they're cut off from the great body\n\n2:21:32.100 --> 2:21:34.320\n of Western literature, for example.\n\n2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:38.240\n I've thought a lot about Elon's argument\n\n2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:40.180\n that we might be in a simulation.\n\n2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:44.980\n No, no, there is a simulation, it's called literature.\n\n2:21:44.980 --> 2:21:49.160\n And we just have to decide whether or not to enter it.\n\n2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:53.320\n I'm currently in the midst of the later stages\n\n2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:57.360\n of Proust's great A l\u00b4heure \u00e9chec du temps perdu,\n\n2:21:57.360 --> 2:22:01.480\n and Proust's observation of human relationships\n\n2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:05.720\n is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer.\n\n2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:09.520\n And it's impossible not to find yourself identifying\n\n2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:14.440\n with Marcel and his obsessive, jealous relationships,\n\n2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:16.080\n particularly with Albertine.\n\n2:22:17.380 --> 2:22:18.480\n It's the simulation.\n\n2:22:18.480 --> 2:22:23.480\n And you decide, I think, as a sentient being,\n\n2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:26.960\n how far to, in your own life,\n\n2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:30.480\n reenact these more profound experiences\n\n2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:31.960\n that others have written down.\n\n2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:34.320\n One of my earliest literary simulations\n\n2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:37.480\n was to reenact Jack Kerouac's Trippin on the Road\n\n2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:40.680\n when I was 17, culminating in getting very wasted\n\n2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:44.840\n in the Hanging Gardens of Xochimilco, not to be missed.\n\n2:22:44.840 --> 2:22:48.720\n And it hit me, just as I was reading Proust,\n\n2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:51.160\n that that's really how to live a rich life,\n\n2:22:51.160 --> 2:22:53.720\n that one lives life, but one lives it\n\n2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:56.280\n juxtaposing one's own experience\n\n2:22:56.280 --> 2:23:00.440\n against the more refined experiences of the great writers.\n\n2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:03.000\n So it gives me hope that my children do that a bit.\n\n2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:09.400\n Do you include the Russian authors in the canon?\n\n2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:11.680\n Yes, I don't read Russian,\n\n2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:14.880\n but I was entirely obsessed\n\n2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:17.160\n with Russian literature as a schoolboy.\n\n2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:22.160\n I read my way through Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev,\n\n2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:24.840\n I, Chekhov.\n\n2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:29.840\n I think of all of those writers,\n\n2:23:29.960 --> 2:23:31.600\n Tolstoy had the biggest impact\n\n2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.340\n because at the end of War and Peace,\n\n2:23:33.340 --> 2:23:36.020\n there's this great essay on historical determinism,\n\n2:23:36.020 --> 2:23:39.680\n which I think was the reason I became a historian.\n\n2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:44.680\n But I'm really temperamentally a kind of Turgenev person,\n\n2:23:46.940 --> 2:23:48.140\n oddly enough.\n\n2:23:48.140 --> 2:23:51.060\n I think if you haven't read those novelists,\n\n2:23:51.060 --> 2:23:54.160\n I mean, you can't really be a complete human being\n\n2:23:54.160 --> 2:23:57.740\n if you haven't read the Brothers Karamazov.\n\n2:23:57.740 --> 2:24:00.960\n You're not really, you're not grown up.\n\n2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:02.840\n And so I think in many ways,\n\n2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:05.960\n those are the greatest novels.\n\n2:24:05.960 --> 2:24:09.440\n Raskolnikov, remember Raskolnikov's Nightmare\n\n2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:12.240\n at the end of Crime and Punishment,\n\n2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:15.320\n in which he imagines in his dream\n\n2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:19.420\n a world in which a terrible virus spreads.\n\n2:24:19.420 --> 2:24:20.640\n Do you remember this?\n\n2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:23.560\n And this virus has the effect of making every individual\n\n2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:26.740\n think that what he believes is right.\n\n2:24:27.640 --> 2:24:31.960\n And in this self righteousness,\n\n2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:36.920\n people fall on one another and commit appalling violence.\n\n2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:39.580\n That's Raskolnikov's Nightmare, and it's a prophecy.\n\n2:24:39.580 --> 2:24:43.080\n It's a terrible prophecy of Russia's future.\n\n2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:47.800\n Yeah, and coupled with that is probably the,\n\n2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:50.520\n I also like the French, the existentialists, all that.\n\n2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:53.880\n The full spectrum and German's Hermann Hesse\n\n2:24:53.880 --> 2:24:57.100\n and just that range of human thought\n\n2:24:57.100 --> 2:24:58.680\n as expressed in the literature is fascinating.\n\n2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.460\n I really love your idea that the simulation,\n\n2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:08.200\n like one way to live life\n\n2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:11.840\n is to kind of explore these other worlds\n\n2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:14.940\n and borrow from them wisdom\n\n2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:17.560\n that you then just map onto your own lives.\n\n2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:20.120\n You almost like stitch together your life\n\n2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:22.360\n with these kind of pieces from literature.\n\n2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:27.360\n The highly educated person is constantly struck by illusion.\n\n2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:32.360\n Everything is an illusion to something that one has read.\n\n2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:34.880\n And that is the simulation.\n\n2:25:34.880 --> 2:25:38.200\n That's what the real metaverse is.\n\n2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:42.040\n It's the imaginary world that we enter when we read,\n\n2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:45.780\n empathize, and then recognize in our daily lives\n\n2:25:45.780 --> 2:25:48.960\n some scrap of the shared experience\n\n2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:51.020\n that literature gives us.\n\n2:25:51.020 --> 2:25:54.320\n Yeah, I think I've aspired to be the idiot\n\n2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:57.280\n from Prince Mishkin from Dostoevsky\n\n2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:59.800\n and in aspiring to be that,\n\n2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:04.380\n I have become the idiot, I feel, at least in part.\n\n2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:09.240\n What, you mentioned the human condition,\n\n2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:12.400\n does love have to do?\n\n2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:15.080\n What role does it play in the human condition?\n\n2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:16.900\n Friendship, love.\n\n2:26:20.240 --> 2:26:24.160\n Love is the drug.\n\n2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:29.160\n Love is, this was the great Roxy music line\n\n2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:33.980\n that Brian Ferry wrote.\n\n2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:37.320\n And love is the most powerful\n\n2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:39.820\n and dangerous of all the drugs.\n\n2:26:41.120 --> 2:26:46.120\n The driving force that overrides our reason.\n\n2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:51.120\n And of course, it is the primal urge.\n\n2:26:53.120 --> 2:26:57.120\n So what a civilized society has to do\n\n2:26:57.120 --> 2:27:00.800\n is to prevent that drug, that primal force\n\n2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.680\n from creating mayhem.\n\n2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:08.000\n So there have to be rules like monogamy\n\n2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:13.000\n and rituals like marriage that reign love in.\n\n2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:18.000\n And make the addicts at least more or less under control.\n\n2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:26.000\n And I think that's part of why I'm a romantic\n\n2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.000\n rather than a Steve Pinker, enlightenment rationalist.\n\n2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:37.320\n Because the romantics realized that love was the drug.\n\n2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:39.120\n It's like,\n\n2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:44.120\n the difference in sensibility between Handel and Wagner.\n\n2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:49.160\n And I had a Wagnerian phase when I was an undergraduate.\n\n2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:52.520\n And I still remember thinking that in,\n\n2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:56.560\n as old as Lieberstod,\n\n2:27:56.560 --> 2:27:59.000\n that Wagner had got the closest to sex\n\n2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:03.280\n that anybody had ever got in music,\n\n2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:05.120\n or perhaps to love.\n\n2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.120\n I'm lucky that I love my wife and that we were,\n\n2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:17.360\n by the time we met, you know, smart enough to understand\n\n2:28:18.080 --> 2:28:22.080\n that love is a drug that you have to kind of take\n\n2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:25.520\n in certain careful ways.\n\n2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:30.520\n And that it works best in the context of a stable relationship\n\n2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:35.520\n it works best in the context of a stable family.\n\n2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:38.200\n That's the key thing.\n\n2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:40.560\n That one has to sort of take the drug\n\n2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:44.400\n and then submit to the conventions\n\n2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:47.360\n of marriage and family life.\n\n2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:52.360\n I think in that respect, I'm a kind of tamed romantic.\n\n2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:56.680\n Tamed romantic.\n\n2:28:56.680 --> 2:28:58.000\n That's how I'd like to think of myself.\n\n2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.040\n The degree to which your romanticism is tamed\n\n2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:03.320\n can be then channeled into productive work.\n\n2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:05.560\n That's why you are a historian and a writer\n\n2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:08.040\n is the best that love is channeled through the writing.\n\n2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:09.760\n So if you're going to be addicted to anything,\n\n2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:11.160\n be addicted to work.\n\n2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:13.600\n I mean, we're all addictive,\n\n2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:15.680\n but the thing about workaholism\n\n2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:17.800\n is that it is the most productive addiction.\n\n2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:22.880\n And rather that than drugs or booze.\n\n2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:27.480\n So yes, I'm always trying to channel my anxieties\n\n2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:28.800\n into work.\n\n2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:31.320\n I learned that at a relatively early age,\n\n2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:33.640\n it's a sort of massively productive way\n\n2:29:33.640 --> 2:29:36.560\n of coping with the inner demons.\n\n2:29:36.560 --> 2:29:39.360\n And again, we should teach kids that\n\n2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:42.960\n because let's come back to our earlier conversation\n\n2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:43.800\n about universities.\n\n2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:45.120\n Part of what happens at university\n\n2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:49.400\n is that adolescents have to overcome all the inner demons.\n\n2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:52.760\n And these include deep insecurity\n\n2:29:52.760 --> 2:29:55.600\n about one's appearance, about one's intellect,\n\n2:29:55.600 --> 2:29:58.240\n and then madly raging hormones\n\n2:29:58.240 --> 2:30:00.520\n that cause you to behave like a complete fool\n\n2:30:00.520 --> 2:30:03.120\n with the people to whom you're sexually attracted.\n\n2:30:03.120 --> 2:30:05.520\n All of this is going on in the university.\n\n2:30:05.520 --> 2:30:07.080\n How can it be a safe space?\n\n2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:09.920\n It's a completely dangerous space by definition.\n\n2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:13.560\n So yeah, I learned teaching young people\n\n2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:15.560\n how to manage these storms,\n\n2:30:16.920 --> 2:30:18.120\n that's part of the job.\n\n2:30:18.120 --> 2:30:20.800\n And we're really not allowed to do that anymore\n\n2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.120\n because we can't talk about these things\n\n2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:24.680\n for fear of the Title IX officers kicking down the door\n\n2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:26.880\n and dragging us off in chains.\n\n2:30:26.880 --> 2:30:28.760\n And like you said, hard work\n\n2:30:28.760 --> 2:30:32.880\n and something you call work ethic in civilization\n\n2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:39.320\n is a pretty effective way to achieve, I think,\n\n2:30:39.320 --> 2:30:42.120\n a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety.\n\n2:30:42.120 --> 2:30:45.120\n Or at least exhaustion so that you sleep well.\n\n2:30:46.680 --> 2:30:49.320\n Well, there is beauty to the exhaustion too.\n\n2:30:49.320 --> 2:30:52.600\n That's why running, there's manual work\n\n2:30:52.600 --> 2:30:55.280\n that some part of us is built for that.\n\n2:30:55.280 --> 2:30:56.120\n Right.\n\n2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:59.560\n I mean, we are products of evolution\n\n2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:03.480\n and our adaptation to a technological world\n\n2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:04.720\n is a very imperfect one.\n\n2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:09.160\n So hence the kind of masochistic urge to run.\n\n2:31:11.080 --> 2:31:14.160\n I like outdoor exercise.\n\n2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:16.240\n I don't really like gyms.\n\n2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:21.240\n So I'll go for long punishing runs in woodland,\n\n2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:24.280\n hike up hills.\n\n2:31:24.280 --> 2:31:27.920\n I like swimming in lakes and in the sea\n\n2:31:27.920 --> 2:31:32.720\n because there just has to be that physical activity\n\n2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:34.680\n in order to do the good mental work.\n\n2:31:34.680 --> 2:31:38.880\n And so it's all about trying to do the best work.\n\n2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:42.440\n That's my sense that we have\n\n2:31:43.760 --> 2:31:45.760\n some random allocation of talent.\n\n2:31:45.760 --> 2:31:47.320\n You kind of figure out what it is\n\n2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:48.960\n that you're relatively good at\n\n2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:51.240\n and you try to do that well.\n\n2:31:51.240 --> 2:31:55.120\n I think my father encouraged me to think that way.\n\n2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:58.520\n And you don't mind about being average at the other stuff.\n\n2:31:58.520 --> 2:31:59.680\n The kind of sick thing\n\n2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:01.280\n is to try to be brilliant at everything.\n\n2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:02.760\n I hate those people.\n\n2:32:02.760 --> 2:32:04.960\n Should really not worry too much\n\n2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:08.480\n if you're just an average double bass player, which I am,\n\n2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:12.160\n or kind of average skier, which I definitely am.\n\n2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:13.560\n Doing those things okay\n\n2:32:13.560 --> 2:32:16.640\n is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life.\n\n2:32:16.640 --> 2:32:19.000\n I was not a good actor,\n\n2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:22.800\n but I got a lot out of acting as an undergraduate.\n\n2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:25.680\n Turned out after three years of experimentation at Oxford\n\n2:32:25.680 --> 2:32:27.720\n that I was, broadly speaking,\n\n2:32:27.720 --> 2:32:32.720\n better at writing history essays than my peers.\n\n2:32:32.880 --> 2:32:34.280\n And that was my edge.\n\n2:32:34.280 --> 2:32:35.800\n That was my comparative advantage.\n\n2:32:35.800 --> 2:32:37.840\n And so I've just tried to make a living\n\n2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:40.280\n from that slight edge.\n\n2:32:40.280 --> 2:32:43.640\n Yeah, that's a beautiful way to describe a life.\n\n2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:46.440\n Is there a meaning to this thing?\n\n2:32:46.440 --> 2:32:47.920\n Is there a meaning to life?\n\n2:32:47.920 --> 2:32:49.880\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:32:49.880 --> 2:32:53.480\n I was brought up by a physicist and a physician.\n\n2:32:54.360 --> 2:32:56.560\n They were more or less committed atheists\n\n2:32:56.560 --> 2:32:58.360\n who had left the Church of Scotland\n\n2:32:59.440 --> 2:33:02.200\n as a protest against sectarianism in Glasgow.\n\n2:33:03.400 --> 2:33:05.600\n And so my sister and I were told from an early age\n\n2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:10.600\n life was a cosmic accident, and that was it.\n\n2:33:10.600 --> 2:33:15.600\n There was no great meaning to it, and I can't really\n\n2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:19.840\n get past that.\n\n2:33:19.840 --> 2:33:24.440\n Isn't there beauty to being an accident at a cosmic scale?\n\n2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:27.840\n Yes, I wasn't taught to feel negative about that.\n\n2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:32.360\n And if anything, it was a frivolous insight\n\n2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.840\n that the whole thing was a kind of joke.\n\n2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:39.840\n And I think that atheism isn't really a basis\n\n2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:45.440\n for ordering a society, but it's been all right for me.\n\n2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:51.720\n I don't have a kind of sense of a missing religious faith.\n\n2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:58.440\n For me, however, there's clearly some embedded\n\n2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:03.800\n Christian ethics in the way my parents lived.\n\n2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:08.360\n And so we were kind of atheist Calvinists\n\n2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:11.520\n who had kind of deposed God, but carried on behaving\n\n2:34:11.520 --> 2:34:14.280\n as if we were members of the elect in a moral universe.\n\n2:34:14.280 --> 2:34:19.280\n So that's kind of the state of mind that I was left in.\n\n2:34:21.160 --> 2:34:26.160\n And I think that we aren't really around long enough\n\n2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:31.960\n to claim that our individual lives have meaning.\n\n2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:35.720\n But what Edmund Burke said is true.\n\n2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:38.640\n The real social contract is between the generations,\n\n2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:41.120\n between the dead, the living, and the unborn.\n\n2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:45.720\n And the meaning of life is, for me at least,\n\n2:34:45.720 --> 2:34:48.120\n to live in a way that honors the dead,\n\n2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:50.520\n seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom\n\n2:34:50.520 --> 2:34:52.120\n because they do still outnumber us.\n\n2:34:52.120 --> 2:34:55.960\n They outnumber the living by quite a significant margin.\n\n2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:58.720\n And then to be mindful of the unborn\n\n2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:03.560\n and our responsibility to them.\n\n2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:07.800\n Writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn.\n\n2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:10.720\n It may or may not succeed, and probably won't succeed\n\n2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:12.160\n if my books are never assigned\n\n2:35:12.160 --> 2:35:14.520\n by work professors in the future.\n\n2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:16.760\n So what we have to do is more than just write books\n\n2:35:16.760 --> 2:35:20.560\n and record podcasts, there have to be institutions.\n\n2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:22.280\n I'm 57 now.\n\n2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:25.200\n I realized recently that succession planning\n\n2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:29.000\n had to be the main focus of the next 20 years\n\n2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:32.960\n because there are things that I really care about\n\n2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:36.760\n that I want future generations to have access to.\n\n2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:41.080\n And so the meaning of life I do regard\n\n2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.280\n as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom.\n\n2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:50.440\n Ultimately the species will go extinct at some point.\n\n2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:53.160\n Even if we do colonize Mars, one senses\n\n2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:56.800\n that physics will catch up with this particular organism,\n\n2:35:56.800 --> 2:35:59.800\n but it's in the pretty far distant future.\n\n2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:01.760\n And so the meaning of life is to make sure\n\n2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:04.960\n that for as long as there are human beings,\n\n2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:09.960\n they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives,\n\n2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:14.320\n ethically fulfilled, intellectually fulfilled,\n\n2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:16.280\n emotionally fulfilled lives\n\n2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:19.080\n that civilization has made possible.\n\n2:36:19.080 --> 2:36:24.080\n It would be easy for us to revert to the uncivilized world.\n\n2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:29.520\n There's a fantastic book that I'm going to misremember.\n\n2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:33.120\n Milosz is the captive soul, the captive mind rather,\n\n2:36:34.160 --> 2:36:37.120\n which has a fantastic passage.\n\n2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:43.000\n He was a Polish intellectual who says,\n\n2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:46.040\n Americans can never imagine what it's like\n\n2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:49.320\n for civilization to be completely destroyed\n\n2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:52.560\n as it was in Poland by the end of World War II,\n\n2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:56.760\n to have no rule of law, to have no security of even person,\n\n2:36:56.760 --> 2:36:58.200\n nevermind property rights.\n\n2:36:58.200 --> 2:36:59.840\n They can't imagine what that's like\n\n2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:01.480\n and what it will lead you to do.\n\n2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:04.600\n So one reason for teaching history\n\n2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:09.600\n is to remind the lucky Generation Z members\n\n2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:15.200\n of California that civilization is a thin film.\n\n2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:18.040\n And it can be destroyed remarkably easily.\n\n2:37:18.040 --> 2:37:19.640\n And to preserve civilization\n\n2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:23.000\n is a tremendous responsibility that we have.\n\n2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.280\n It's a huge responsibility.\n\n2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:27.720\n And we must not destroy ourselves,\n\n2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:30.400\n whether it's in the name of wokeism\n\n2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:33.120\n or the pursuit of the metaverse.\n\n2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:35.520\n Preserving civilization and making it available,\n\n2:37:35.520 --> 2:37:38.480\n not just to our kids, but to people we'll never know,\n\n2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:40.640\n generations ahead, that's the meaning.\n\n2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:45.040\n And do so by studying the lessons of history.\n\n2:37:45.040 --> 2:37:48.560\n Right, not only studying them, but then acting on them.\n\n2:37:48.560 --> 2:37:50.120\n For me, the biggest problem is,\n\n2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:53.160\n how do we apply history more effectively?\n\n2:37:53.160 --> 2:37:56.440\n It seems as if our institutions, including government,\n\n2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:59.640\n are very, very bad at applying history.\n\n2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:02.400\n Lessons of history are learned poorly, if at all.\n\n2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:04.280\n Analogies are drawn crudely.\n\n2:38:04.280 --> 2:38:06.480\n Often the wrong inferences are drawn.\n\n2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:08.360\n One of the big intellectual challenges for me\n\n2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:12.280\n is how to make history more useful.\n\n2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:15.120\n And this was the kind of thing that professors used to hate,\n\n2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:16.920\n but really practically useful,\n\n2:38:16.920 --> 2:38:19.920\n so that policymakers and citizens\n\n2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:22.120\n can think about the decisions that they face\n\n2:38:22.120 --> 2:38:27.120\n with a more historically informed body of knowledge.\n\n2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:29.880\n Whether it's a pandemic, the challenge of climate change,\n\n2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:31.800\n what to do about Taiwan.\n\n2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:36.800\n I can't think of a better set of things to know\n\n2:38:36.800 --> 2:38:39.040\n before you make decisions about those things\n\n2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:41.400\n than the things that history has to offer.\n\n2:38:41.400 --> 2:38:43.560\n Well, I love the discipline of applied history,\n\n2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:45.520\n basically going to history and saying,\n\n2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:50.040\n what are the key principles here\n\n2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:52.600\n that are applicable to the problems of today?\n\n2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:53.440\n Right.\n\n2:38:53.440 --> 2:38:54.280\n And how can we solve that?\n\n2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:57.320\n The great philosopher of history, R.G. Collingwood,\n\n2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:01.160\n said in his autobiography, which was published in 1939,\n\n2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:05.360\n that the purpose of history was to reconstitute\n\n2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:10.320\n past thought from whatever surviving remnants there were,\n\n2:39:10.320 --> 2:39:14.520\n and then to juxtapose it with our own predicament.\n\n2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.400\n And that's that juxtaposition of past experience\n\n2:39:17.400 --> 2:39:19.840\n with present experience that is so important.\n\n2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:22.160\n We don't do that well.\n\n2:39:22.160 --> 2:39:24.080\n And indeed, we've flipped it\n\n2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:26.520\n so that academic historians now think their mission\n\n2:39:26.520 --> 2:39:31.400\n is to travel back to the past with the value system of 2021\n\n2:39:31.400 --> 2:39:36.160\n and castigate the dead for their racism and sexism\n\n2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:38.400\n and transphobia and whatnot.\n\n2:39:38.400 --> 2:39:40.440\n And that's exactly wrong.\n\n2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:42.240\n Our mission is to go back and try to understand\n\n2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:44.960\n what it was like to live in the 18th century,\n\n2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:49.040\n not to go back and condescend to the people of the past.\n\n2:39:49.040 --> 2:39:51.200\n And once we've had a better understanding,\n\n2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:53.640\n once we've seen into their lives, read their words,\n\n2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:55.480\n tried to reconstitute their experience,\n\n2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:58.720\n to come back and understand our own time better,\n\n2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:00.320\n that's what we should really be doing.\n\n2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:01.920\n That's what we should really be doing.\n\n2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:04.120\n But academic history has gone completely haywire,\n\n2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:05.760\n and it does almost the exact opposite\n\n2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:07.520\n of what I think it should do.\n\n2:40:07.520 --> 2:40:11.880\n And by studying history, walk beautifully, gracefully\n\n2:40:11.880 --> 2:40:14.400\n through this simulation, as you described,\n\n2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:17.800\n by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today.\n\n2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:20.560\n We have virtual reality already in our heads.\n\n2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:24.440\n We do not need Oculus and the metaverse.\n\n2:40:24.440 --> 2:40:27.080\n This was an incredible, hopeful conversation\n\n2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:29.560\n in many ways that I did not expect.\n\n2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:31.280\n I thought our conversation would be much more\n\n2:40:31.280 --> 2:40:33.160\n about history than about the future,\n\n2:40:33.160 --> 2:40:35.080\n and it turned out to be the opposite.\n\n2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:36.360\n Thank you so much for talking to me today.\n\n2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:38.720\n It's a huge honor to finally meet you, to talk to you.\n\n2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:40.640\n Thank you for your valuable time.\n\n2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:43.480\n Thank you, Lex, and good luck with Putin.\n\n2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:45.200\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:46.520\n with Neil Ferguson.\n\n2:40:46.520 --> 2:40:47.880\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:40:47.880 --> 2:40:50.680\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:52.720\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:54.760\n from Neil Ferguson himself.\n\n2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:57.920\n No civilization, no matter how mighty it may appear\n\n2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:00.480\n to itself, is indestructible.\n\n2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:27.480\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
