  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.800\n The following is a conversation with Noam Chomsky.\n\n00:03.800 --> 00:06.760\n He's truly one of the great minds of our time\n\n00:06.760 --> 00:08.400\n and is one of the most cited scholars\n\n00:08.400 --> 00:10.760\n in the history of our civilization.\n\n00:10.760 --> 00:13.400\n He has spent over 60 years at MIT\n\n00:13.400 --> 00:16.320\n and recently also joined the University of Arizona,\n\n00:16.320 --> 00:18.640\n where we met for this conversation.\n\n00:18.640 --> 00:21.760\n But it was at MIT about four and a half years ago\n\n00:21.760 --> 00:23.440\n when I first met Noam.\n\n00:23.440 --> 00:24.760\n My first few days there,\n\n00:24.760 --> 00:27.400\n I remember getting into an elevator at Stata Center,\n\n00:27.400 --> 00:29.480\n pressing the button for whatever floor,\n\n00:29.480 --> 00:33.560\n looking up and realizing it was just me and Noam Chomsky\n\n00:33.560 --> 00:35.480\n riding the elevator,\n\n00:35.480 --> 00:38.400\n just me and one of the seminal figures of linguistics,\n\n00:38.400 --> 00:40.000\n cognitive science, philosophy,\n\n00:40.000 --> 00:43.920\n and political thought in the past century, if not ever.\n\n00:43.920 --> 00:47.320\n I tell that silly story because I think life is made up\n\n00:47.320 --> 00:50.740\n of funny little defining moments that you never forget\n\n00:50.740 --> 00:54.880\n for reasons that may be too poetic to try and explain.\n\n00:54.880 --> 00:56.140\n That was one of mine.\n\n00:56.140 --> 00:59.940\n Noam has been an inspiration to me and millions of others.\n\n00:59.940 --> 01:01.500\n It was truly an honor for me\n\n01:01.500 --> 01:03.580\n to sit down with him in Arizona.\n\n01:03.580 --> 01:06.500\n I traveled there just for this conversation.\n\n01:06.500 --> 01:09.140\n And in a rare, heartbreaking moment,\n\n01:09.140 --> 01:11.740\n after everything was set up and tested,\n\n01:11.740 --> 01:13.500\n the camera was moved and accidentally,\n\n01:13.500 --> 01:16.500\n the recording button was pressed, stopping the recording.\n\n01:17.540 --> 01:21.140\n So I have good audio of both of us, but no video of Noam.\n\n01:21.140 --> 01:25.340\n Just the video of me and my sleep deprived but excited face\n\n01:25.340 --> 01:29.620\n that I get to keep as a reminder of my failures.\n\n01:29.620 --> 01:31.500\n Most people just listen to this audio version\n\n01:31.500 --> 01:34.860\n for the podcast as opposed to watching it on YouTube.\n\n01:34.860 --> 01:38.140\n But still, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\n01:38.140 --> 01:40.900\n I hope you understand and still enjoy this conversation\n\n01:40.900 --> 01:42.220\n as much as I did.\n\n01:42.220 --> 01:44.460\n The depth of intellect that Noam showed\n\n01:44.460 --> 01:47.460\n and his willingness to truly listen to me,\n\n01:47.460 --> 01:50.300\n a silly looking Russian in a suit.\n\n01:50.300 --> 01:55.300\n It was humbling and something I'm deeply grateful for.\n\n01:55.580 --> 01:59.660\n As some of you know, this podcast is a side project for me,\n\n01:59.660 --> 02:03.580\n where my main journey and dream is to build AI systems\n\n02:03.580 --> 02:05.480\n that do some good for the world.\n\n02:05.480 --> 02:07.820\n This latter effort takes up most of my time,\n\n02:07.820 --> 02:10.540\n but for the moment has been mostly private.\n\n02:10.540 --> 02:12.820\n But the former, the podcast,\n\n02:12.820 --> 02:15.380\n is something I put my heart and soul into.\n\n02:15.380 --> 02:18.600\n And I hope you feel that, even when I screw things up.\n\n02:18.600 --> 02:21.120\n I recently started doing ads\n\n02:21.120 --> 02:22.840\n at the end of the introduction.\n\n02:22.840 --> 02:25.640\n I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode\n\n02:25.640 --> 02:27.400\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n02:27.400 --> 02:29.720\n that break the flow of the conversation.\n\n02:29.720 --> 02:31.160\n I hope that works for you\n\n02:31.160 --> 02:33.960\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n02:33.960 --> 02:37.200\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n02:37.200 --> 02:39.800\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:39.800 --> 02:41.840\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n02:41.840 --> 02:43.240\n support it on Patreon,\n\n02:43.240 --> 02:45.400\n or simply connect with me on Twitter,\n\n02:45.400 --> 02:49.440\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n02:49.440 --> 02:51.720\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n02:51.720 --> 02:54.240\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:54.240 --> 02:56.800\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n02:56.800 --> 02:58.760\n but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n02:58.760 --> 03:01.320\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:04.160\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n03:04.160 --> 03:07.120\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,\n\n03:07.120 --> 03:09.200\n no matter what the stock price is.\n\n03:09.200 --> 03:11.960\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n03:11.960 --> 03:15.560\n a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n03:15.560 --> 03:17.680\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n03:17.680 --> 03:20.920\n to support one of my favorite organizations called The First,\n\n03:20.920 --> 03:24.360\n best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n03:24.360 --> 03:27.720\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n03:27.720 --> 03:29.640\n in over 110 countries\n\n03:29.640 --> 03:31.840\n and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n03:31.840 --> 03:33.840\n which means the donated money\n\n03:33.840 --> 03:36.560\n is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n03:36.560 --> 03:38.680\n When you get Cash App from the App Store,\n\n03:38.680 --> 03:42.800\n Google Play and use code LexPodcast,\n\n03:42.800 --> 03:47.120\n you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n03:47.120 --> 03:49.800\n which again is an organization that I've personally seen\n\n03:49.800 --> 03:54.520\n inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n03:54.520 --> 03:58.940\n And now here's my conversation with Noam Chomsky.\n\n03:59.840 --> 04:04.160\n I apologize for the absurd philosophical question,\n\n04:04.160 --> 04:07.120\n but if an alien species were to visit Earth,\n\n04:07.120 --> 04:10.920\n do you think we would be able to find a common language\n\n04:10.920 --> 04:13.680\n or protocol of communication with them?\n\n04:13.680 --> 04:18.320\n There are arguments to the effect that we could.\n\n04:18.320 --> 04:22.440\n In fact, one of them was Marv Minsky's.\n\n04:22.440 --> 04:24.760\n Back about 20 or 30 years ago,\n\n04:24.760 --> 04:29.760\n he performed a brief experiment with a student of his,\n\n04:30.040 --> 04:33.760\n Dan Bobrow, they essentially ran\n\n04:33.760 --> 04:36.720\n the simplest possible touring machines,\n\n04:36.720 --> 04:39.560\n just free to see what would happen.\n\n04:39.560 --> 04:42.560\n And most of them crashed,\n\n04:42.560 --> 04:47.560\n either got into an infinite loop or stopped.\n\n04:47.800 --> 04:51.000\n The few that persisted,\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:54.900\n essentially gave something like arithmetic.\n\n04:55.960 --> 04:58.800\n And his conclusion from that was that\n\n04:59.980 --> 05:04.980\n if some alien species developed higher intelligence,\n\n05:04.980 --> 05:07.440\n they would at least have arithmetic,\n\n05:07.440 --> 05:12.440\n they would at least have what the simplest computer would do.\n\n05:12.940 --> 05:16.040\n And in fact, he didn't know that at the time,\n\n05:16.040 --> 05:20.760\n but the core principles of natural language\n\n05:20.760 --> 05:25.220\n are based on operations which yield something\n\n05:25.220 --> 05:29.360\n like arithmetic in the limiting case, in the minimal case.\n\n05:29.360 --> 05:34.040\n So it's conceivable that a mode of communication\n\n05:34.040 --> 05:38.560\n could be established based on the core properties\n\n05:38.560 --> 05:41.460\n of human language and the core properties of arithmetic,\n\n05:41.460 --> 05:43.620\n which maybe are universally shared.\n\n05:44.920 --> 05:46.680\n So it's conceivable.\n\n05:46.680 --> 05:50.800\n What is the structure of that language,\n\n05:50.800 --> 05:55.160\n of language as an internal system inside our mind\n\n05:55.160 --> 05:58.920\n versus an external system as it's expressed?\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:00.880\n It's not an alternative,\n\n06:00.880 --> 06:02.960\n it's two different concepts of language.\n\n06:02.960 --> 06:03.780\n Different.\n\n06:03.780 --> 06:07.280\n It's a simple fact that there's something about you,\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:11.640\n a trait of yours, part of the organism, you,\n\n06:11.640 --> 06:14.600\n that determines that you're talking English\n\n06:14.600 --> 06:16.980\n and not Tagalog, let's say.\n\n06:16.980 --> 06:18.640\n So there is an inner system.\n\n06:19.480 --> 06:22.960\n It determines the sound and meaning\n\n06:22.960 --> 06:27.120\n of the infinite number of expressions of your language.\n\n06:27.120 --> 06:28.720\n It's localized.\n\n06:28.720 --> 06:31.760\n It's not on your foot, obviously, it's in your brain.\n\n06:31.760 --> 06:35.240\n If you look more closely, it's in specific configurations\n\n06:35.240 --> 06:36.480\n of your brain.\n\n06:36.480 --> 06:40.600\n And that's essentially like the internal structure\n\n06:40.600 --> 06:44.960\n of your laptop, whatever programs it has are in there.\n\n06:44.960 --> 06:47.840\n Now, one of the things you can do with language,\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:50.040\n it's a marginal thing, in fact,\n\n06:50.040 --> 06:54.800\n is use it to externalize what's in your head.\n\n06:54.800 --> 06:56.660\n Actually, most of your use of language\n\n06:56.660 --> 06:58.820\n is thought, internal thought.\n\n06:58.820 --> 07:00.920\n But you can do what you and I are now doing.\n\n07:00.920 --> 07:02.640\n We can externalize it.\n\n07:02.640 --> 07:05.640\n Well, the set of things that we're externalizing\n\n07:05.640 --> 07:07.680\n are an external system.\n\n07:07.680 --> 07:11.160\n They're noises in the atmosphere.\n\n07:11.160 --> 07:12.920\n And you can call that language\n\n07:12.920 --> 07:14.360\n in some other sense of the word.\n\n07:14.360 --> 07:16.800\n But it's not a set of alternatives.\n\n07:16.800 --> 07:18.980\n These are just different concepts.\n\n07:18.980 --> 07:22.200\n So how deep do the roots of language go in our brain?\n\n07:23.500 --> 07:26.780\n Our mind, is it yet another feature like vision,\n\n07:26.780 --> 07:28.480\n or is it something more fundamental\n\n07:28.480 --> 07:31.520\n from which everything else springs in the human mind?\n\n07:31.520 --> 07:33.720\n Well, in a way, it's like vision.\n\n07:33.720 --> 07:38.580\n There's something about our genetic endowment\n\n07:38.580 --> 07:41.600\n that determines that we have a mammalian\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:44.720\n rather than an insect visual system.\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:47.440\n And there's something in our genetic endowment\n\n07:47.440 --> 07:51.440\n that determines that we have a human language faculty.\n\n07:51.440 --> 07:55.200\n No other organism has anything remotely similar.\n\n07:55.200 --> 07:58.280\n So in that sense, it's internal.\n\n07:58.280 --> 07:59.720\n Now there is a long tradition,\n\n07:59.720 --> 08:03.600\n which I think is valid going back centuries\n\n08:03.600 --> 08:05.500\n to the early scientific revolution,\n\n08:05.500 --> 08:09.340\n at least that holds that language\n\n08:09.340 --> 08:13.620\n is the sort of the core of human cognitive nature.\n\n08:13.620 --> 08:18.080\n It's the source, it's the mode for constructing thoughts\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:19.640\n and expressing them.\n\n08:19.640 --> 08:22.760\n That is what forms thought.\n\n08:22.760 --> 08:27.200\n And it's got fundamental creative capacities.\n\n08:27.200 --> 08:31.320\n It's free, independent, unbounded, and so on.\n\n08:31.320 --> 08:34.860\n And undoubtedly, I think the basis\n\n08:34.860 --> 08:38.480\n for our creative capacities\n\n08:38.480 --> 08:43.480\n and the other remarkable human capacities\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:47.500\n that lead to the unique achievements\n\n08:47.500 --> 08:51.300\n and not so great achievements of the species.\n\n08:51.300 --> 08:53.620\n The capacity to think and reason,\n\n08:53.620 --> 08:56.240\n do you think that's deeply linked with language?\n\n08:56.240 --> 08:58.200\n Do you think the way we,\n\n08:58.200 --> 09:01.560\n the internal language system is essentially the mechanism\n\n09:01.560 --> 09:04.120\n by which we also reason internally?\n\n09:04.120 --> 09:06.920\n It is undoubtedly the mechanism by which we reason.\n\n09:06.920 --> 09:09.320\n There may also be other fact,\n\n09:09.320 --> 09:13.220\n there are undoubtedly other faculties involved in reasoning.\n\n09:14.720 --> 09:17.520\n We have a kind of scientific faculty,\n\n09:17.520 --> 09:18.840\n nobody knows what it is,\n\n09:18.840 --> 09:20.920\n but whatever it is that enables us\n\n09:20.920 --> 09:25.440\n to pursue certain lines of endeavor and inquiry\n\n09:25.440 --> 09:29.760\n and to decide what makes sense and doesn't make sense\n\n09:29.760 --> 09:32.200\n and to achieve a certain degree\n\n09:32.200 --> 09:33.640\n of understanding of the world,\n\n09:33.640 --> 09:36.480\n that uses language, but goes beyond it.\n\n09:37.440 --> 09:42.000\n Just as using our capacity for arithmetic\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:44.880\n is not the same as having the capacity.\n\n09:44.880 --> 09:49.360\n The idea of capacity, our biology, evolution,\n\n09:49.360 --> 09:52.520\n you've talked about it defining essentially our capacity,\n\n09:52.520 --> 09:55.200\n our limit and our scope.\n\n09:55.200 --> 09:58.840\n Can you try to define what limit and scope are?\n\n09:58.840 --> 10:01.160\n And the bigger question,\n\n10:01.160 --> 10:04.800\n do you think it's possible to find the limit\n\n10:04.800 --> 10:06.220\n of human cognition?\n\n10:07.560 --> 10:09.880\n Well, that's an interesting question.\n\n10:09.880 --> 10:13.080\n It's commonly believed, most scientists believe\n\n10:13.080 --> 10:17.640\n that human intelligence can answer any question\n\n10:17.640 --> 10:19.340\n in principle.\n\n10:19.340 --> 10:21.800\n I think that's a very strange belief.\n\n10:21.800 --> 10:24.280\n If we're biological organisms,\n\n10:24.280 --> 10:26.160\n which are not angels,\n\n10:26.160 --> 10:31.160\n then our capacities ought to have scope\n\n10:31.800 --> 10:34.920\n and limits which are interrelated.\n\n10:34.920 --> 10:36.620\n Can you define those two terms?\n\n10:36.620 --> 10:40.740\n Well, let's take a concrete example.\n\n10:40.740 --> 10:44.040\n Your genetic endowment determines\n\n10:44.040 --> 10:46.840\n that you can have a male in visual system,\n\n10:46.840 --> 10:49.260\n arms and legs and so on,\n\n10:49.260 --> 10:53.440\n but it therefore become a rich, complex organism.\n\n10:53.440 --> 10:56.240\n But if you look at that same genetic endowment,\n\n10:56.240 --> 10:59.980\n it prevents you from developing in other directions.\n\n10:59.980 --> 11:01.720\n There's no kind of experience\n\n11:01.720 --> 11:05.760\n which would yield the embryo\n\n11:05.760 --> 11:08.760\n to develop an insect visual system\n\n11:08.760 --> 11:11.960\n or to develop wings instead of arms.\n\n11:11.960 --> 11:16.960\n So the very endowment that confers richness and complexity\n\n11:16.960 --> 11:21.960\n also sets bounds on what can be attained.\n\n11:23.600 --> 11:27.440\n Now, I assume that our cognitive capacities\n\n11:27.440 --> 11:29.640\n are part of the organic world.\n\n11:29.640 --> 11:32.260\n Therefore, they should have the same properties.\n\n11:32.260 --> 11:35.700\n If they had no built in capacity\n\n11:35.700 --> 11:39.180\n to develop a rich and complex structure,\n\n11:39.180 --> 11:41.920\n we would understand nothing.\n\n11:41.920 --> 11:46.080\n Just as if your genetic endowment\n\n11:46.080 --> 11:50.320\n did not compel you to develop arms and legs,\n\n11:50.320 --> 11:54.000\n you would just be some kind of random amoeboid creature\n\n11:54.000 --> 11:56.080\n with no structure at all.\n\n11:56.080 --> 12:00.240\n So I think it's plausible to assume that there are limits\n\n12:00.240 --> 12:03.680\n and I think we even have some evidence as to what they are.\n\n12:03.680 --> 12:06.660\n So for example, there's a classic moment\n\n12:06.660 --> 12:10.660\n in the history of science at the time of Newton.\n\n12:11.620 --> 12:15.360\n There was a from Galileo to Newton modern science\n\n12:15.360 --> 12:17.920\n developed on a fundamental assumption\n\n12:17.920 --> 12:20.120\n which Newton also accepted.\n\n12:20.120 --> 12:24.100\n Namely that the world is an entire universe\n\n12:24.100 --> 12:26.340\n is a mechanical object.\n\n12:26.340 --> 12:29.260\n And by mechanical, they meant something like\n\n12:29.260 --> 12:31.640\n the kinds of artifacts that were being developed\n\n12:31.640 --> 12:34.260\n by skilled artisans all over Europe,\n\n12:34.260 --> 12:37.120\n the gears, levers and so on.\n\n12:37.120 --> 12:39.320\n And their belief was well,\n\n12:39.320 --> 12:42.000\n the world is just a more complex variant of this.\n\n12:42.000 --> 12:47.000\n Newton, to his astonishment and distress,\n\n12:48.400 --> 12:50.960\n proved that there are no machines,\n\n12:50.960 --> 12:53.440\n that there's interaction without contact.\n\n12:54.300 --> 12:57.640\n His contemporaries like Leibniz and Huygens\n\n12:57.640 --> 13:02.560\n just dismissed this as returning to the mysticism\n\n13:02.560 --> 13:03.960\n of the neo scholastics.\n\n13:03.960 --> 13:05.840\n And Newton agreed.\n\n13:05.840 --> 13:08.240\n He said it is totally absurd.\n\n13:08.240 --> 13:11.120\n No person of any scientific intelligence\n\n13:11.120 --> 13:13.760\n could ever accept this for a moment.\n\n13:13.760 --> 13:15.280\n In fact, he spent the rest of his life\n\n13:15.280 --> 13:17.720\n trying to get around it somehow,\n\n13:17.720 --> 13:20.320\n as did many other scientists.\n\n13:20.320 --> 13:24.040\n That was the very criterion of intelligibility\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:26.520\n for say Galileo or Newton.\n\n13:27.640 --> 13:31.260\n Theory did not produce an intelligible world\n\n13:31.260 --> 13:34.040\n unless you could duplicate it in a machine.\n\n13:34.040 --> 13:37.520\n He showed you can't, there are no machines, any.\n\n13:37.520 --> 13:41.240\n Finally, after a long struggle, took a long time,\n\n13:41.240 --> 13:45.240\n scientists just accepted this as common sense.\n\n13:45.240 --> 13:47.400\n But that's a significant moment.\n\n13:47.400 --> 13:49.360\n That means they abandoned the search\n\n13:49.360 --> 13:51.780\n for an intelligible world.\n\n13:51.780 --> 13:54.800\n And the great philosophers of the time\n\n13:54.800 --> 13:57.000\n understood that very well.\n\n13:57.000 --> 14:02.000\n So for example, David Hume in his encomium to Newton\n\n14:02.320 --> 14:05.560\n wrote that who was the greatest thinker ever and so on.\n\n14:05.560 --> 14:10.520\n He said that he unveiled many of the secrets of nature,\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:13.320\n but by showing the imperfections\n\n14:13.320 --> 14:17.520\n of the mechanical philosophy, mechanical science,\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:21.240\n he left us with, he showed that there are mysteries\n\n14:21.240 --> 14:23.560\n which ever will remain.\n\n14:23.560 --> 14:26.760\n And science just changed its goals.\n\n14:26.760 --> 14:28.720\n It abandoned the mysteries.\n\n14:28.720 --> 14:31.480\n It can't solve it, we'll put it aside.\n\n14:31.480 --> 14:34.740\n We only look for intelligible theories.\n\n14:34.740 --> 14:36.680\n Newton's theories were intelligible.\n\n14:36.680 --> 14:39.080\n It's just what they described wasn't.\n\n14:39.080 --> 14:42.780\n Well, Locke said the same thing.\n\n14:42.780 --> 14:44.800\n I think they're basically right.\n\n14:44.800 --> 14:47.000\n And if so, that showed something\n\n14:47.000 --> 14:49.680\n about the limits of human cognition.\n\n14:49.680 --> 14:54.680\n We cannot attain the goal of understanding the world,\n\n14:55.680 --> 14:58.400\n of finding an intelligible world.\n\n14:58.400 --> 15:02.540\n This mechanical philosophy Galileo to Newton,\n\n15:02.540 --> 15:05.260\n there's a good case that can be made\n\n15:05.260 --> 15:10.260\n that that's our instinctive conception of how things work.\n\n15:10.980 --> 15:15.980\n So if say infants are tested with things that,\n\n15:16.220 --> 15:18.660\n if this moves and then this moves,\n\n15:18.660 --> 15:22.060\n they kind of invent something that must be invisible\n\n15:22.060 --> 15:24.940\n that's in between them that's making them move and so on.\n\n15:24.940 --> 15:26.500\n Yeah, we like physical contact.\n\n15:26.500 --> 15:28.940\n Something about our brain seeks.\n\n15:28.940 --> 15:31.540\n Makes us want a world like that.\n\n15:31.540 --> 15:32.940\n Just like it wants a world\n\n15:32.940 --> 15:36.620\n that has regular geometric figures.\n\n15:36.620 --> 15:38.900\n So for example, Descartes pointed this out\n\n15:38.900 --> 15:41.820\n that if you have an infant\n\n15:41.820 --> 15:46.820\n who's never seen a triangle before and you draw a triangle,\n\n15:47.660 --> 15:52.220\n the infant will see a distorted triangle,\n\n15:52.220 --> 15:56.340\n not whatever crazy figure it actually is.\n\n15:56.340 --> 15:58.420\n Three lines not coming quite together,\n\n15:58.420 --> 16:00.300\n one of them a little bit curved and so on.\n\n16:00.300 --> 16:04.500\n We just impose a conception of the world\n\n16:04.500 --> 16:09.340\n in terms of geometric, perfect geometric objects.\n\n16:09.340 --> 16:12.140\n It's now been shown that goes way beyond that.\n\n16:12.140 --> 16:15.420\n That if you show on a tachistoscope,\n\n16:15.420 --> 16:18.540\n let's say a couple of lights shining,\n\n16:18.540 --> 16:20.860\n you do it three or four times in a row.\n\n16:20.860 --> 16:25.240\n What people actually see is a rigid object in motion,\n\n16:25.240 --> 16:26.900\n not whatever's there.\n\n16:26.900 --> 16:31.900\n We all know that from a television set basically.\n\n16:31.900 --> 16:34.660\n So that gives us hints of potential limits\n\n16:34.660 --> 16:35.980\n to our cognition.\n\n16:35.980 --> 16:39.420\n I think it does, but it's a very contested view.\n\n16:39.420 --> 16:42.300\n If you do a poll among scientists,\n\n16:42.300 --> 16:45.460\n it's impossible we can understand anything.\n\n16:46.360 --> 16:48.620\n Let me ask and give me a chance with this.\n\n16:48.620 --> 16:52.540\n So I just spent a day at a company called Neuralink\n\n16:52.540 --> 16:56.380\n and what they do is try to design\n\n16:56.380 --> 16:59.580\n what's called the brain machine, brain computer interface.\n\n16:59.580 --> 17:03.300\n So they try to do thousands readings in the brain,\n\n17:03.300 --> 17:05.580\n be able to read what the neurons are firing\n\n17:05.580 --> 17:08.540\n and then stimulate back, so two way.\n\n17:08.540 --> 17:12.780\n Do you think their dream is to expand the capacity\n\n17:12.780 --> 17:16.660\n of the brain to attain information,\n\n17:16.660 --> 17:18.180\n sort of increase the bandwidth\n\n17:18.180 --> 17:22.460\n of which we can search Google kind of thing?\n\n17:22.460 --> 17:26.260\n Do you think our cognitive capacity might be expanded\n\n17:26.260 --> 17:29.340\n our linguistic capacity, our ability to reason\n\n17:29.340 --> 17:33.180\n might be expanded by adding a machine into the picture?\n\n17:33.180 --> 17:35.620\n Can be expanded in a certain sense,\n\n17:35.620 --> 17:39.860\n but a sense that was known thousands of years ago.\n\n17:39.860 --> 17:43.700\n A book expands your cognitive capacity.\n\n17:43.700 --> 17:46.060\n Okay, so this could expand it too.\n\n17:46.060 --> 17:47.940\n But it's not a fundamental expansion.\n\n17:47.940 --> 17:50.940\n It's not totally new things could be understood.\n\n17:50.940 --> 17:53.060\n Well, nothing that goes beyond\n\n17:53.060 --> 17:56.500\n their native cognitive capacities.\n\n17:56.500 --> 17:58.620\n Just like you can't turn the visual system\n\n17:58.620 --> 18:00.660\n into an insect system.\n\n18:00.660 --> 18:03.300\n Well, I mean, the thought is,\n\n18:04.220 --> 18:06.820\n the thought is perhaps you can't directly,\n\n18:06.820 --> 18:08.660\n but you can map sort of.\n\n18:08.660 --> 18:10.060\n You couldn't, but we already,\n\n18:10.060 --> 18:12.380\n we know that without this experiment.\n\n18:12.380 --> 18:16.740\n You could map what a bee sees and present it in a form\n\n18:16.740 --> 18:17.980\n so that we could follow it.\n\n18:17.980 --> 18:19.940\n In fact, every bee scientist does that.\n\n18:19.940 --> 18:24.420\n But you don't think there's something greater than bees\n\n18:25.380 --> 18:29.700\n that we can map and then all of a sudden discover something,\n\n18:29.700 --> 18:33.780\n be able to understand a quantum world, quantum mechanics,\n\n18:33.780 --> 18:35.980\n be able to start to be able to make sense.\n\n18:35.980 --> 18:40.460\n Students at MIT study and understand quantum mechanics.\n\n18:41.660 --> 18:45.100\n But they always reduce it to the infant, the physical.\n\n18:45.100 --> 18:46.900\n I mean, they don't really understand.\n\n18:46.900 --> 18:50.260\n Oh, you don't, there's thing, that may be another area\n\n18:50.260 --> 18:52.740\n where there's just a limit to understanding.\n\n18:52.740 --> 18:54.500\n We understand the theories,\n\n18:54.500 --> 18:58.420\n but the world that it describes doesn't make any sense.\n\n18:58.420 --> 19:01.460\n So, you know, the experiment, Schrodinger's cat,\n\n19:01.460 --> 19:03.700\n for example, can understand the theory,\n\n19:03.700 --> 19:05.780\n but as Schrodinger pointed out,\n\n19:05.780 --> 19:07.500\n it's an unintelligible world.\n\n19:09.300 --> 19:11.140\n One of the reasons why Einstein\n\n19:11.140 --> 19:14.420\n was always very skeptical about quantum theory,\n\n19:14.420 --> 19:19.340\n was that he described himself as a classical realist,\n\n19:19.340 --> 19:23.060\n in one's intelligibility.\n\n19:23.060 --> 19:26.020\n He has something in common with infants in that way.\n\n19:27.460 --> 19:29.980\n So, back to linguistics.\n\n19:30.940 --> 19:34.020\n If you could humor me, what are the most beautiful\n\n19:34.020 --> 19:36.100\n or fascinating aspects of language\n\n19:36.100 --> 19:38.740\n or ideas in linguistics or cognitive science\n\n19:38.740 --> 19:42.060\n that you've seen in a lifetime of studying language\n\n19:42.060 --> 19:44.180\n and studying the human mind?\n\n19:44.180 --> 19:49.180\n Well, I think the deepest property of language\n\n19:50.140 --> 19:52.820\n and puzzling property that's been discovered\n\n19:52.820 --> 19:57.180\n is what is sometimes called structure dependence.\n\n19:57.180 --> 19:59.580\n We now understand it pretty well,\n\n19:59.580 --> 20:01.940\n but it was puzzling for a long time.\n\n20:01.940 --> 20:03.620\n I'll give you a concrete example.\n\n20:03.620 --> 20:08.620\n So, suppose you say the guy who fixed the car\n\n20:09.420 --> 20:13.100\n carefully packed his tools, it's ambiguous.\n\n20:13.100 --> 20:17.940\n He could fix the car carefully or carefully pack his tools.\n\n20:17.940 --> 20:21.060\n Suppose you put carefully in front,\n\n20:21.060 --> 20:25.860\n carefully the guy who fixed the car packed his tools,\n\n20:25.860 --> 20:29.380\n then it's carefully packed, not carefully fixed.\n\n20:29.380 --> 20:32.300\n And in fact, you do that even if it makes no sense.\n\n20:32.300 --> 20:34.620\n So, suppose you say carefully,\n\n20:34.620 --> 20:38.140\n the guy who fixed the car is tall.\n\n20:39.340 --> 20:41.860\n You have to interpret it as carefully he's tall,\n\n20:41.860 --> 20:44.300\n even though that doesn't make any sense.\n\n20:44.300 --> 20:47.180\n And notice that that's a very puzzling fact\n\n20:47.180 --> 20:50.060\n because you're relating carefully\n\n20:50.060 --> 20:53.620\n not to the linearly closest verb,\n\n20:53.620 --> 20:57.300\n but to the linearly more remote verb.\n\n20:57.300 --> 21:02.300\n A linear closeness is an easy computation,\n\n21:02.340 --> 21:03.700\n but here you're doing a much more,\n\n21:03.700 --> 21:06.780\n what looks like a more complex computation.\n\n21:06.780 --> 21:10.180\n You're doing something that's taking you essentially\n\n21:10.180 --> 21:11.860\n to the more remote thing.\n\n21:13.580 --> 21:16.620\n It's now, if you look at the actual structure\n\n21:16.620 --> 21:20.140\n of the sentence, where the phrases are and so on,\n\n21:20.140 --> 21:24.180\n turns out you're picking out the structurally closest thing,\n\n21:24.180 --> 21:27.940\n but the linearly more remote thing.\n\n21:27.940 --> 21:32.500\n But notice that what's linear is 100% of what you hear.\n\n21:32.500 --> 21:35.140\n You never hear structure, can't.\n\n21:35.140 --> 21:37.300\n So, what you're doing is,\n\n21:37.300 --> 21:40.660\n and certainly this is universal, all constructions,\n\n21:40.660 --> 21:44.660\n all languages, and what we're compelled to do\n\n21:44.660 --> 21:48.660\n is carry out what looks like the more complex computation\n\n21:48.660 --> 21:52.260\n on material that we never hear,\n\n21:52.260 --> 21:55.380\n and we ignore 100% of what we hear\n\n21:55.380 --> 21:57.500\n and the simplest computation.\n\n21:57.500 --> 22:00.700\n By now, there's even a neural basis for this\n\n22:00.700 --> 22:02.860\n that's somewhat understood,\n\n22:02.860 --> 22:04.380\n and there's good theories by now\n\n22:04.380 --> 22:06.620\n that explain why it's true.\n\n22:06.620 --> 22:11.580\n That's a deep insight into the surprising nature of language\n\n22:11.580 --> 22:13.140\n with many consequences.\n\n22:14.100 --> 22:17.540\n Let me ask you about a field of machine learning,\n\n22:17.540 --> 22:18.940\n deep learning.\n\n22:18.940 --> 22:22.060\n There's been a lot of progress in neural networks based,\n\n22:22.060 --> 22:26.380\n neural network based machine learning in the recent decade.\n\n22:26.380 --> 22:29.940\n Of course, neural network research goes back many decades.\n\n22:30.780 --> 22:35.580\n What do you think are the limits of deep learning,\n\n22:35.580 --> 22:38.500\n of neural network based machine learning?\n\n22:38.500 --> 22:41.140\n Well, to give a real answer to that,\n\n22:41.140 --> 22:44.940\n you'd have to understand the exact processes\n\n22:44.940 --> 22:47.940\n that are taking place, and those are pretty opaque.\n\n22:47.940 --> 22:50.260\n So, it's pretty hard to prove a theorem\n\n22:50.260 --> 22:54.060\n about what can be done and what can't be done,\n\n22:54.060 --> 22:56.820\n but I think it's reasonably clear.\n\n22:56.820 --> 22:59.180\n I mean, putting technicalities aside,\n\n22:59.180 --> 23:01.940\n what deep learning is doing\n\n23:01.940 --> 23:05.340\n is taking huge numbers of examples\n\n23:05.340 --> 23:07.740\n and finding some patterns.\n\n23:07.740 --> 23:11.980\n Okay, that could be interesting in some areas it is,\n\n23:11.980 --> 23:15.060\n but we have to ask here a certain question.\n\n23:15.060 --> 23:18.220\n Is it engineering or is it science?\n\n23:18.220 --> 23:20.580\n Engineering in the sense of just trying\n\n23:20.580 --> 23:22.820\n to build something that's useful,\n\n23:22.820 --> 23:24.780\n or science in the sense that it's trying\n\n23:24.780 --> 23:28.740\n to understand something about elements of the world.\n\n23:28.740 --> 23:31.820\n So, take, say, a Google parser.\n\n23:31.820 --> 23:33.860\n We can ask that question.\n\n23:33.860 --> 23:36.860\n Is it useful, yeah, it's pretty useful.\n\n23:36.860 --> 23:41.860\n I use a Google translator, so on engineering grounds,\n\n23:41.860 --> 23:45.740\n it's kind of worth having, like a bulldozer.\n\n23:45.740 --> 23:48.900\n Does it tell you anything about human language?\n\n23:48.900 --> 23:53.900\n Zero, nothing, and in fact, it's very striking.\n\n23:54.940 --> 23:56.780\n From the very beginning,\n\n23:56.780 --> 24:00.300\n it's just totally remote from science.\n\n24:00.300 --> 24:02.580\n So, what is a Google parser doing?\n\n24:02.580 --> 24:05.140\n It's taking an enormous text,\n\n24:05.140 --> 24:07.700\n let's say the Wall Street Journal corpus,\n\n24:07.700 --> 24:10.540\n and asking how close can we come\n\n24:10.540 --> 24:14.100\n to getting the right description\n\n24:14.100 --> 24:16.380\n of every sentence in the corpus.\n\n24:16.380 --> 24:18.500\n Well, every sentence in the corpus\n\n24:18.500 --> 24:21.540\n is essentially an experiment.\n\n24:21.540 --> 24:24.740\n Each sentence that you produce is an experiment\n\n24:24.740 --> 24:27.700\n which says, am I a grammatical sentence?\n\n24:27.700 --> 24:29.620\n The answer is usually yes.\n\n24:29.620 --> 24:31.300\n So, most of the stuff in the corpus\n\n24:31.300 --> 24:33.220\n is grammatical sentences.\n\n24:33.220 --> 24:36.820\n But now, ask yourself, is there any science\n\n24:36.820 --> 24:40.140\n which takes random experiments\n\n24:40.140 --> 24:43.700\n which are carried out for no reason whatsoever\n\n24:43.700 --> 24:46.500\n and tries to find out something from them?\n\n24:46.500 --> 24:49.660\n Like if you're, say, a chemistry PhD student,\n\n24:49.660 --> 24:51.180\n you wanna get a thesis, can you say,\n\n24:51.180 --> 24:55.380\n well, I'm just gonna mix a lot of things together,\n\n24:55.380 --> 24:59.660\n no purpose, and maybe I'll find something.\n\n24:59.660 --> 25:02.420\n You'd be laughed out of the department.\n\n25:02.420 --> 25:06.180\n Science tries to find critical experiments,\n\n25:06.180 --> 25:09.100\n ones that answer some theoretical question.\n\n25:09.100 --> 25:12.940\n Doesn't care about coverage of millions of experiments.\n\n25:12.940 --> 25:16.220\n So, it just begins by being very remote from science\n\n25:16.220 --> 25:18.220\n and it continues like that.\n\n25:18.220 --> 25:21.620\n So, the usual question that's asked about,\n\n25:21.620 --> 25:25.180\n say, a Google parser is how well does it do,\n\n25:25.180 --> 25:28.300\n or some parser, how well does it do on a corpus?\n\n25:28.300 --> 25:31.100\n But there's another question that's never asked.\n\n25:31.100 --> 25:32.900\n How well does it do on something\n\n25:32.900 --> 25:36.060\n that violates all the rules of language?\n\n25:36.060 --> 25:38.700\n So, for example, take the structure dependence case\n\n25:38.700 --> 25:39.660\n that I mentioned.\n\n25:39.660 --> 25:41.580\n Suppose there was a language\n\n25:41.580 --> 25:45.780\n in which you used linear proximity\n\n25:45.780 --> 25:49.020\n as the mode of interpretation.\n\n25:49.020 --> 25:51.700\n These deep learning would work very easily on that.\n\n25:51.700 --> 25:54.740\n In fact, much more easily on an actual language.\n\n25:54.740 --> 25:55.900\n Is that a success?\n\n25:55.900 --> 25:59.020\n No, that's a failure from a scientific point of view.\n\n25:59.020 --> 26:00.340\n It's a failure.\n\n26:00.340 --> 26:03.460\n It shows that we're not discovering\n\n26:03.460 --> 26:05.780\n the nature of the system at all,\n\n26:05.780 --> 26:07.700\n because it does just as well or even better\n\n26:07.700 --> 26:10.820\n on things that violate the structure of the system.\n\n26:10.820 --> 26:12.660\n And it goes on from there.\n\n26:12.660 --> 26:14.740\n It's not an argument against doing it.\n\n26:14.740 --> 26:17.140\n It is useful to have devices like this.\n\n26:17.140 --> 26:20.620\n So, yes, so neural networks are kind of approximators\n\n26:20.620 --> 26:24.340\n that look, there's echoes of the behavioral debates, right?\n\n26:24.340 --> 26:26.140\n Behavioralism.\n\n26:26.140 --> 26:27.580\n More than echoes.\n\n26:27.580 --> 26:30.060\n Many of the people in deep learning\n\n26:30.060 --> 26:34.540\n say they've vindicated Terry Sanyosky, for example,\n\n26:34.540 --> 26:35.700\n in his recent books,\n\n26:35.700 --> 26:39.500\n as this vindicates Skinnerian behaviors.\n\n26:39.500 --> 26:41.420\n It doesn't have anything to do with it.\n\n26:41.420 --> 26:43.780\n Yes, but I think there's something\n\n26:44.620 --> 26:46.140\n actually fundamentally different\n\n26:46.140 --> 26:48.260\n when the data set is huge.\n\n26:48.260 --> 26:51.140\n But your point is extremely well taken.\n\n26:51.140 --> 26:55.380\n But do you think we can learn, approximate\n\n26:55.380 --> 26:58.780\n that interesting complex structure of language\n\n26:58.780 --> 27:00.100\n with neural networks\n\n27:00.100 --> 27:02.740\n that will somehow help us understand the science?\n\n27:03.620 --> 27:04.460\n It's possible.\n\n27:04.460 --> 27:07.220\n I mean, you find patterns that you hadn't noticed,\n\n27:07.220 --> 27:09.700\n let's say, could be.\n\n27:09.700 --> 27:13.580\n In fact, it's very much like a kind of linguistics\n\n27:13.580 --> 27:18.060\n that's done, what's called corpus linguistics.\n\n27:18.060 --> 27:21.060\n When you, suppose you have some language\n\n27:21.060 --> 27:23.420\n where all the speakers have died out,\n\n27:23.420 --> 27:25.100\n but you have records.\n\n27:25.100 --> 27:28.060\n So you just look at the records\n\n27:28.060 --> 27:30.580\n and see what you can figure out from that.\n\n27:30.580 --> 27:31.900\n It's much better than,\n\n27:31.900 --> 27:33.660\n it's much better to have actual speakers\n\n27:33.660 --> 27:36.060\n where you can do critical experiments.\n\n27:36.060 --> 27:38.500\n But if they're all dead, you can't do them.\n\n27:38.500 --> 27:40.780\n So you have to try to see what you can find out\n\n27:40.780 --> 27:43.860\n from just looking at the data that's around.\n\n27:43.860 --> 27:45.020\n You can learn things.\n\n27:45.020 --> 27:48.380\n Actually, paleoanthropology is very much like that.\n\n27:48.380 --> 27:51.220\n You can't do a critical experiment on\n\n27:51.220 --> 27:53.500\n what happened two million years ago.\n\n27:53.500 --> 27:56.540\n So you're kind of forced just to take what data's around\n\n27:56.540 --> 27:59.220\n and see what you can figure out from it.\n\n27:59.220 --> 28:01.420\n Okay, it's a serious study.\n\n28:01.420 --> 28:05.580\n So let me venture into another whole body of work\n\n28:05.580 --> 28:07.400\n and philosophical question.\n\n28:08.380 --> 28:13.060\n You've said that evil in society arises from institutions,\n\n28:13.060 --> 28:15.540\n not inherently from our nature.\n\n28:15.540 --> 28:17.780\n Do you think most human beings are good,\n\n28:17.780 --> 28:19.580\n they have good intent?\n\n28:19.580 --> 28:22.860\n Or do most have the capacity for intentional evil\n\n28:22.860 --> 28:24.620\n that depends on their upbringing,\n\n28:24.620 --> 28:27.180\n depends on their environment, on context?\n\n28:27.180 --> 28:30.960\n I wouldn't say that they don't arise from our nature.\n\n28:30.960 --> 28:34.020\n Anything we do arises from our nature.\n\n28:34.020 --> 28:38.100\n And the fact that we have certain institutions, not others,\n\n28:38.100 --> 28:43.100\n is one mode in which human nature has expressed itself.\n\n28:43.700 --> 28:45.420\n But as far as we know,\n\n28:45.420 --> 28:48.500\n human nature could yield many different kinds\n\n28:48.500 --> 28:50.220\n of institutions.\n\n28:50.220 --> 28:53.140\n The particular ones that have developed\n\n28:53.140 --> 28:56.940\n have to do with historical contingency,\n\n28:56.940 --> 28:59.140\n who conquered whom, and that sort of thing.\n\n29:00.560 --> 29:03.840\n They're not rooted in our nature\n\n29:03.840 --> 29:06.740\n in the sense that they're essential to our nature.\n\n29:06.740 --> 29:10.140\n So it's commonly argued that these days\n\n29:10.140 --> 29:12.920\n that something like market systems\n\n29:12.920 --> 29:15.580\n is just part of our nature.\n\n29:15.580 --> 29:18.660\n But we know from a huge amount of evidence\n\n29:18.660 --> 29:19.500\n that that's not true.\n\n29:19.500 --> 29:21.740\n There's all kinds of other structures.\n\n29:21.740 --> 29:26.220\n It's a particular fact of a moment of modern history.\n\n29:26.220 --> 29:30.740\n Others have argued that the roots of classical liberalism\n\n29:30.740 --> 29:34.420\n actually argue that what's called sometimes\n\n29:34.420 --> 29:36.460\n an instinct for freedom,\n\n29:36.460 --> 29:39.920\n the instinct to be free of domination\n\n29:39.920 --> 29:43.660\n by illegitimate authority is the core of our nature.\n\n29:43.660 --> 29:45.620\n That would be the opposite of this.\n\n29:45.620 --> 29:47.500\n And we don't know.\n\n29:47.500 --> 29:50.720\n We just know that human nature can accommodate both kinds.\n\n29:52.220 --> 29:53.900\n If you look back at your life,\n\n29:54.900 --> 29:58.100\n is there a moment in your intellectual life\n\n29:58.100 --> 30:00.180\n or life in general that jumps from memory\n\n30:00.180 --> 30:02.100\n that brought you happiness\n\n30:02.100 --> 30:04.020\n that you would love to relive again?\n\n30:05.100 --> 30:06.460\n Sure.\n\n30:06.460 --> 30:10.100\n Falling in love, having children.\n\n30:10.100 --> 30:13.860\n What about, so you have put forward into the world\n\n30:13.860 --> 30:17.660\n a lot of incredible ideas in linguistics,\n\n30:17.660 --> 30:22.300\n in cognitive science, in terms of ideas\n\n30:22.300 --> 30:26.060\n that just excites you when it first came to you\n\n30:26.060 --> 30:28.940\n that you would love to relive those moments.\n\n30:28.940 --> 30:32.140\n Well, I mean, when you make a discovery\n\n30:32.140 --> 30:34.100\n about something that's exciting,\n\n30:34.100 --> 30:39.100\n like, say, even the observation of structure dependence\n\n30:40.500 --> 30:44.440\n and on from that, the explanation for it.\n\n30:44.440 --> 30:49.440\n But the major things just seem like common sense.\n\n30:49.460 --> 30:53.160\n So if you go back to take your question\n\n30:53.160 --> 30:55.820\n about external and internal language,\n\n30:55.820 --> 30:58.120\n you go back to, say, the 1950s,\n\n30:59.140 --> 31:03.900\n almost entirely languages regarded an external object,\n\n31:03.900 --> 31:06.260\n something outside the mind.\n\n31:06.260 --> 31:09.380\n It just seemed obvious that that can't be true.\n\n31:10.700 --> 31:13.220\n Like I said, there's something about you\n\n31:13.220 --> 31:15.340\n that determines you're talking English,\n\n31:15.340 --> 31:18.640\n not Swahili or something.\n\n31:18.640 --> 31:20.280\n But that's not really a discovery.\n\n31:20.280 --> 31:24.100\n That's just an observation, what's transparent.\n\n31:24.100 --> 31:29.100\n You might say it's kind of like the 17th century,\n\n31:30.660 --> 31:33.460\n the beginnings of modern science, 17th century.\n\n31:33.460 --> 31:37.980\n They came from being willing to be puzzled\n\n31:37.980 --> 31:40.400\n about things that seemed obvious.\n\n31:40.400 --> 31:44.280\n So it seems obvious that a heavy ball of lead\n\n31:44.280 --> 31:47.580\n will fall faster than a light ball of lead.\n\n31:47.580 --> 31:50.900\n But Galileo was not impressed by the fact\n\n31:50.900 --> 31:52.680\n that it seemed obvious.\n\n31:52.680 --> 31:54.900\n So he wanted to know if it's true.\n\n31:54.900 --> 31:59.140\n They carried out experiments, actually thought experiments,\n\n31:59.140 --> 32:01.180\n never actually carried them out,\n\n32:01.180 --> 32:04.460\n which that can't be true.\n\n32:04.460 --> 32:09.460\n And out of things like that, observations of that kind,\n\n32:11.600 --> 32:15.740\n why does a ball fall to the ground instead of rising,\n\n32:15.740 --> 32:20.060\n let's say, seems obvious, till you start thinking about it,\n\n32:20.060 --> 32:23.900\n because why does steam rise, let's say.\n\n32:23.900 --> 32:27.260\n And I think the beginnings of modern linguistics,\n\n32:27.260 --> 32:30.060\n roughly in the 50s, are kind of like that,\n\n32:30.060 --> 32:33.620\n just being willing to be puzzled about phenomena\n\n32:33.620 --> 32:38.020\n that looked, from some point of view, obvious.\n\n32:38.020 --> 32:41.340\n And for example, a kind of doctrine,\n\n32:41.340 --> 32:44.960\n almost official doctrine of structural linguistics\n\n32:44.960 --> 32:49.620\n in the 50s was that languages can differ\n\n32:49.620 --> 32:52.660\n from one another in arbitrary ways,\n\n32:52.660 --> 32:56.460\n and each one has to be studied on its own\n\n32:56.460 --> 32:58.900\n without any presuppositions.\n\n32:58.900 --> 33:02.380\n In fact, there were similar views among biologists\n\n33:02.380 --> 33:05.880\n about the nature of organisms, that each one's,\n\n33:05.880 --> 33:07.780\n they're so different when you look at them\n\n33:07.780 --> 33:10.980\n that almost anything, you could be almost anything.\n\n33:10.980 --> 33:13.140\n Well, in both domains, it's been learned\n\n33:13.140 --> 33:15.500\n that that's very far from true.\n\n33:15.500 --> 33:18.860\n There are narrow constraints on what could be an organism\n\n33:18.860 --> 33:20.620\n or what could be a language.\n\n33:21.580 --> 33:25.540\n But these are, that's just the nature of inquiry.\n\n33:25.540 --> 33:29.380\n Inquiry. Science in general, yeah, inquiry.\n\n33:29.380 --> 33:33.420\n So one of the peculiar things about us human beings\n\n33:33.420 --> 33:35.300\n is our mortality.\n\n33:35.300 --> 33:38.220\n Ernest Becker explored it in general.\n\n33:38.220 --> 33:40.460\n Do you ponder the value of mortality?\n\n33:40.460 --> 33:42.460\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n33:43.460 --> 33:46.820\n I used to when I was about 12 years old.\n\n33:48.100 --> 33:51.940\n I wondered, I didn't care much about my own mortality,\n\n33:51.940 --> 33:54.540\n but I was worried about the fact that\n\n33:54.540 --> 33:57.700\n if my consciousness disappeared,\n\n33:57.700 --> 34:00.300\n would the entire universe disappear?\n\n34:00.300 --> 34:01.580\n That was frightening.\n\n34:01.580 --> 34:03.740\n Did you ever find an answer to that question?\n\n34:03.740 --> 34:05.900\n No, nobody's ever found an answer,\n\n34:05.900 --> 34:07.900\n but I stopped being bothered by it.\n\n34:07.900 --> 34:10.380\n It's kind of like Woody Allen in one of his films,\n\n34:10.380 --> 34:14.100\n you may recall, he starts, he goes to a shrink\n\n34:14.100 --> 34:16.460\n when he's a child and the shrink asks him,\n\n34:16.460 --> 34:17.500\n what's your problem?\n\n34:17.500 --> 34:21.700\n He says, I just learned that the universe is expanding.\n\n34:21.700 --> 34:22.740\n I can't handle that.\n\n34:22.740 --> 34:27.220\n And then another absurd question is,\n\n34:27.220 --> 34:32.220\n what do you think is the meaning of our existence here,\n\n34:32.620 --> 34:35.980\n our life on Earth, our brief little moment in time?\n\n34:35.980 --> 34:38.580\n That's something we answer by our own activities.\n\n34:40.620 --> 34:42.340\n There's no general answer.\n\n34:42.340 --> 34:44.620\n We determine what the meaning of it is.\n\n34:46.620 --> 34:48.700\n The action determine the meaning.\n\n34:48.700 --> 34:50.580\n Meaning in the sense of significance,\n\n34:50.580 --> 34:54.500\n not meaning in the sense that chair means this.\n\n34:55.420 --> 34:58.820\n But the significance of your life is something you create.\n\n35:01.060 --> 35:02.540\n No, thank you so much for talking to me today.\n\n35:02.540 --> 35:04.140\n It was a huge honor.\n\n35:04.140 --> 35:05.060\n Thank you so much.\n\n35:05.940 --> 35:08.660\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Noah Chomsky\n\n35:08.660 --> 35:11.980\n and thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App.\n\n35:11.980 --> 35:16.180\n Download it, use code LexPodcast, you'll get $10\n\n35:16.180 --> 35:19.660\n and $10 will go to FIRST, a STEM education nonprofit\n\n35:19.660 --> 35:22.340\n that inspires hundreds of thousands of young minds\n\n35:22.340 --> 35:25.980\n to learn and to dream of engineering our future.\n\n35:25.980 --> 35:28.620\n If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n35:28.620 --> 35:32.060\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast, support on Patreon,\n\n35:32.060 --> 35:34.260\n or connect with me on Twitter.\n\n35:34.260 --> 35:50.260\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
