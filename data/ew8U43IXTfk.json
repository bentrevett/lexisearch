founded with the purpose to create meat\n\n00:07.340 --> 00:10.560\n that's good for people, the planet, and the animals,\n\n00:10.560 --> 00:14.900\n specifically treating their animals as ethically as possible.\n\n00:14.900 --> 00:18.120\n In this, she sought to revolutionize the meat industry\n\n00:18.120 --> 00:19.600\n from the inside out.\n\n00:19.600 --> 00:22.120\n She's also a scholar and practitioner\n\n00:22.120 --> 00:24.080\n of regenerative agriculture,\n\n00:24.080 --> 00:26.940\n and she's a chef who has appeared many times\n\n00:26.940 --> 00:28.760\n as a judge on Iron Chef.\n\n00:28.760 --> 00:32.880\n Plus, she has one of my favorite food related Instagrams.\n\n00:32.880 --> 00:34.920\n On top of that, she's also a longtime friend\n\n00:34.920 --> 00:38.500\n of Andrew Huberman, which is how we first got connected.\n\n00:38.500 --> 00:40.280\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:40.280 --> 00:43.520\n Gala Games, Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic,\n\n00:43.520 --> 00:45.620\n and Fundrise.\n\n00:45.620 --> 00:48.780\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:48.780 --> 00:52.020\n As a side note, let me say that I got the chance to visit\n\n00:52.020 --> 00:53.840\n and spend a few days with Anya\n\n00:53.840 --> 00:56.800\n at Belcampo Farms in Northern California.\n\n00:56.800 --> 00:59.920\n I met many animals there, from cows to pigs,\n\n00:59.920 --> 01:03.120\n and saw the amazing land on which they grazed.\n\n01:03.120 --> 01:07.640\n I butchered meat, I watched Anya cook many amazing meals,\n\n01:07.640 --> 01:10.380\n I ate raw meat and cooked meat,\n\n01:10.380 --> 01:14.400\n and spent long hours at the bonfire talking with friends\n\n01:14.400 --> 01:16.800\n and listening to the sounds of nature.\n\n01:16.800 --> 01:19.600\n I hiked, swam in a cold mountain lake,\n\n01:19.600 --> 01:22.780\n and slept in a tent underneath the stars.\n\n01:22.780 --> 01:25.480\n It was an amazing eye opening experience,\n\n01:25.480 --> 01:29.920\n especially in my first ever visit to a slaughterhouse.\n\n01:29.920 --> 01:33.600\n The term slaughterhouse is haunting in itself.\n\n01:33.600 --> 01:36.560\n The animals I met lived a great life,\n\n01:36.560 --> 01:38.960\n but in the end, they were slaughtered,\n\n01:38.960 --> 01:40.720\n in the most ethical way possible,\n\n01:40.720 --> 01:43.020\n but slaughtered nevertheless.\n\n01:43.020 --> 01:45.200\n Seeing animals with whom just the day before\n\n01:45.200 --> 01:47.960\n I made a connection be converted to meat\n\n01:47.960 --> 01:51.840\n that I then consumed was deeply honest to me.\n\n01:51.840 --> 01:54.480\n This ethical farm, Belcampo,\n\n01:54.480 --> 01:56.660\n represents less than 1% of animals raised\n\n01:56.660 --> 01:58.120\n in the United States.\n\n01:58.120 --> 02:00.560\n The rest is factory farmed.\n\n02:00.560 --> 02:01.960\n I could not escape the thought\n\n02:01.960 --> 02:05.000\n of the 40 to 50 billion animals worldwide\n\n02:05.000 --> 02:08.400\n raised in terrible conditions on these factory farms.\n\n02:08.400 --> 02:10.680\n I've spent most of my life thinking about\n\n02:10.680 --> 02:13.880\n and being in contact with human suffering,\n\n02:13.880 --> 02:15.200\n but the landscape of suffering\n\n02:15.200 --> 02:16.800\n in the minds of conscious beings\n\n02:16.800 --> 02:19.000\n is much larger than humans.\n\n02:19.000 --> 02:21.280\n I must admit that I still am haunted\n\n02:21.280 --> 02:24.480\n by human suffering more than animal suffering.\n\n02:24.480 --> 02:26.640\n Perhaps I will one day see the wrong\n\n02:26.640 --> 02:28.680\n in me drawing such a line.\n\n02:28.680 --> 02:30.960\n Either way, the visit to Belcampo Farms\n\n02:30.960 --> 02:34.200\n made me realize that I have not thought deeply enough\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:36.240\n about the ethics of my choices\n\n02:36.240 --> 02:38.120\n and the choices of human civilization\n\n02:38.120 --> 02:39.880\n with respect to animals.\n\n02:39.880 --> 02:42.920\n And more importantly, I have not thought\n\n02:42.920 --> 02:45.800\n or learned enough about large scale solutions\n\n02:45.800 --> 02:48.040\n to alleviate animal suffering.\n\n02:48.040 --> 02:49.960\n Belcampo is paving the way on this\n\n02:49.960 --> 02:52.160\n and is the reason I wanted to show my support\n\n02:52.160 --> 02:55.920\n for their and Anya's efforts in regenerative farming\n\n02:55.920 --> 02:58.740\n and ethical treatment of animals.\n\n02:58.740 --> 03:00.720\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast\n\n03:00.720 --> 03:03.760\n and here is my conversation with Anya Fernald.\n\n03:12.960 --> 03:15.700\n If you're watching the video version of this\n\n03:15.700 --> 03:17.940\n and are asking yourself why we're in nature right now,\n\n03:17.940 --> 03:20.940\n there's actually a beautiful mountain in the background.\n\n03:22.240 --> 03:24.440\n There's an incredible vast landscape.\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:25.300\n There's a farm.\n\n03:26.720 --> 03:28.900\n We're sitting behind a table and nevertheless,\n\n03:28.900 --> 03:32.340\n I'm wearing a suit and tie amidst nature.\n\n03:32.340 --> 03:35.400\n We're at the beautiful Belcampo Farms.\n\n03:35.400 --> 03:36.800\n We're going to talk about that,\n\n03:36.800 --> 03:38.280\n this incredible place you have here,\n\n03:38.280 --> 03:40.680\n but you cooked some meat yesterday.\n\n03:40.680 --> 03:42.040\n It tasted delicious.\n\n03:42.040 --> 03:44.640\n So I'd love to talk about just the science\n\n03:44.640 --> 03:46.720\n and art of cooking first.\n\n03:46.720 --> 03:49.600\n You as a chef, when you think of cooking,\n\n03:49.600 --> 03:51.960\n is it a science or is it an art?\n\n03:51.960 --> 03:55.560\n Art and service together, probably.\n\n03:55.560 --> 04:00.560\n Art to me because it's about creating something of beauty\n\n04:00.920 --> 04:03.400\n and being responsive and creating something\n\n04:03.400 --> 04:06.200\n that's expression of creativity and love.\n\n04:06.200 --> 04:09.560\n Cooking also has a very strong element of service\n\n04:09.560 --> 04:11.640\n and it doesn't mean necessarily service to another person,\n\n04:11.640 --> 04:15.040\n but like service to health, wellness, environment.\n\n04:15.040 --> 04:17.440\n There's an element of supporting through food\n\n04:17.440 --> 04:18.960\n in how I approach cooking.\n\n04:18.960 --> 04:21.280\n So it's bigger than just like how the ingredients\n\n04:21.280 --> 04:22.680\n come together to form a taste.\n\n04:22.680 --> 04:23.760\n It's the whole pipeline.\n\n04:23.760 --> 04:26.840\n Like the fact that there's a lot of work\n\n04:26.840 --> 04:30.900\n that went into bringing the ingredients together\n\n04:30.900 --> 04:35.900\n and then giving you the ability to make the meal\n\n04:36.560 --> 04:39.160\n and then who gets to consume the meal and the whole thing.\n\n04:39.160 --> 04:43.060\n And you see that as service as opposed to just the taste.\n\n04:43.060 --> 04:46.680\n Yeah, I also think of food as one of the key ways\n\n04:46.680 --> 04:51.040\n that we interact with our environment, right?\n\n04:51.040 --> 04:52.540\n It's the part of our environment\n\n04:52.540 --> 04:54.560\n that goes inside us most visibly, right?\n\n04:54.560 --> 04:55.900\n Of course, we interact with our environment.\n\n04:55.900 --> 04:58.480\n We could have skin creams that have certain things in them\n\n04:58.480 --> 05:01.000\n or our clothes can then be absorbed.\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:02.080\n There's things in the air.\n\n05:02.080 --> 05:03.960\n There's our water and there's food, right?\n\n05:03.960 --> 05:06.600\n It's like how we're engaging in the world.\n\n05:06.600 --> 05:08.680\n Physiologically, it's the most significant way\n\n05:08.680 --> 05:10.640\n we engage in our environment.\n\n05:10.640 --> 05:13.320\n We're extracting resources, calories, energy\n\n05:13.320 --> 05:14.960\n from the environment in various ways\n\n05:14.960 --> 05:19.120\n in order to preserve our bodies.\n\n05:19.120 --> 05:21.320\n There's also so many feedback loops\n\n05:21.320 --> 05:23.800\n that I don't think we know the beginning of\n\n05:23.800 --> 05:27.000\n that our bodies are picking up on around nutrients,\n\n05:27.000 --> 05:29.600\n available nutrients, immune response.\n\n05:29.600 --> 05:33.800\n Like there's deep levels of sensory evaluation\n\n05:33.800 --> 05:38.200\n that lead to health and alertness and wellness.\n\n05:38.200 --> 05:41.000\n You hear about this a lot with babies that, you know,\n\n05:42.040 --> 05:43.880\n if there's a risk of an infection\n\n05:43.880 --> 05:46.380\n that a mom's breast milk will help the baby\n\n05:46.380 --> 05:48.760\n develop a resistance, like there's this way\n\n05:48.760 --> 05:50.320\n that our bodies can tune into health\n\n05:50.320 --> 05:52.640\n and can't extrapolate from that in any specific way,\n\n05:52.640 --> 05:55.240\n but think about that as an example of the many ways\n\n05:55.240 --> 05:58.400\n in which our bodies are reading available nutrients and food\n\n05:58.400 --> 06:01.680\n to signal other aspects of wellness and health.\n\n06:01.680 --> 06:06.680\n That said, the final product of cooking is,\n\n06:06.680 --> 06:08.540\n when done well, is really delicious.\n\n06:08.540 --> 06:10.380\n And what we ate yesterday was really delicious.\n\n06:10.380 --> 06:15.380\n So that aspect of it, bringing the ingredients together\n\n06:15.420 --> 06:17.340\n in a way that tastes delicious,\n\n06:17.340 --> 06:19.700\n do you see that as a science or art?\n\n06:19.700 --> 06:21.020\n That's the art of it.\n\n06:21.020 --> 06:24.220\n I mean, the art is like creating temptation\n\n06:24.220 --> 06:27.060\n and indulgence and giving people pause,\n\n06:27.060 --> 06:29.800\n you know, like creating experience that's like so sensual.\n\n06:29.800 --> 06:33.220\n And like, I love that about when I make something\n\n06:33.220 --> 06:36.460\n really simple and beautiful and delicious\n\n06:36.460 --> 06:38.980\n the way that, like there's that moment of silence\n\n06:38.980 --> 06:39.900\n at the table.\n\n06:39.900 --> 06:43.700\n And that to me is the moment of art, like appreciation.\n\n06:43.700 --> 06:44.620\n What about the buildup?\n\n06:44.620 --> 06:48.020\n I mean, we got to watch you make the stuff over a fire.\n\n06:48.020 --> 06:51.060\n So the calmness of the air, I mean, that's an experience.\n\n06:51.060 --> 06:54.780\n We don't often get to see that experience of the preparation.\n\n06:54.780 --> 06:56.540\n It's the anticipation, like you said.\n\n06:56.540 --> 06:58.180\n Maybe that's the most delicious part of a meal\n\n06:58.180 --> 06:59.820\n is the anticipation of it.\n\n06:59.820 --> 07:01.540\n That's something that I'm glad you bring up\n\n07:01.540 --> 07:04.140\n because it's an element that with eating so many\n\n07:04.140 --> 07:08.140\n of our meals, like out of a bag and you know,\n\n07:08.140 --> 07:09.860\n the instance where you start to eat the meals\n\n07:09.860 --> 07:12.140\n when the delivery shows up and you might smell something\n\n07:12.140 --> 07:13.100\n when you open the bag, right?\n\n07:13.100 --> 07:14.620\n And no judgment on that.\n\n07:14.620 --> 07:16.180\n That's something I do too, right?\n\n07:16.180 --> 07:18.540\n But that does take away a whole element\n\n07:18.540 --> 07:20.900\n of surprise and delight.\n\n07:20.900 --> 07:23.540\n And also I think of your body's ability to prepare for it.\n\n07:23.540 --> 07:25.500\n You know, you think about our most common memories\n\n07:25.500 --> 07:28.220\n of childhood for those of us who grew up in homes\n\n07:28.220 --> 07:31.740\n with parents who cooked is smell of things cooking.\n\n07:31.740 --> 07:33.060\n And it's not the eating of it.\n\n07:33.060 --> 07:35.060\n It's the smell of things cooking.\n\n07:35.060 --> 07:37.460\n So why is that so memorable?\n\n07:37.460 --> 07:40.220\n It's an anticipatory piece of food.\n\n07:40.220 --> 07:42.540\n That's what you remember about your experiences of food\n\n07:42.540 --> 07:44.340\n is the moment of like sweet anticipation\n\n07:44.340 --> 07:46.180\n of this great sensual experience.\n\n07:46.180 --> 07:48.820\n It's gonna be really gratifying on these emotional\n\n07:48.820 --> 07:49.980\n and physical levels.\n\n07:49.980 --> 07:52.700\n So I think we're also resonating on those memories\n\n07:52.700 --> 07:55.500\n because it's like, it's an experience of food\n\n07:55.500 --> 07:58.060\n where the sensuality of it is kind of extended.\n\n07:58.060 --> 08:00.140\n So it's a long kind of arc of buildup\n\n08:00.140 --> 08:01.620\n and then you're eating it and it's amazing.\n\n08:01.620 --> 08:03.740\n Then you're enjoying it and your body feels good.\n\n08:03.740 --> 08:05.340\n So all those pieces together,\n\n08:05.340 --> 08:06.860\n it's a much more memorable experience\n\n08:06.860 --> 08:08.980\n than just grabbing the cookie out of a bag, right?\n\n08:08.980 --> 08:12.660\n So look at our own and just revisit in your mind\n\n08:12.660 --> 08:15.420\n like the memories of food, the most compelling ones.\n\n08:15.420 --> 08:18.820\n It's the smell and then the experience\n\n08:18.820 --> 08:20.940\n and then sometimes how one felt, right?\n\n08:20.940 --> 08:22.940\n Yeah, and the people involved with the smell.\n\n08:22.940 --> 08:25.220\n So like somehow it's all tied in together\n\n08:25.220 --> 08:27.100\n whether it's family or people close to you\n\n08:27.100 --> 08:28.540\n or even if it's just chefs.\n\n08:28.540 --> 08:32.660\n There's something about the personality of the human\n\n08:32.660 --> 08:33.740\n involved in making the food\n\n08:33.740 --> 08:35.900\n that kind of sticks with you in the memory.\n\n08:35.900 --> 08:38.980\n And for me, I recently did a 72 hour fast\n\n08:38.980 --> 08:42.220\n and there's a kind of sadness after you eat\n\n08:42.220 --> 08:43.060\n that it's over.\n\n08:43.060 --> 08:45.420\n I think the most delicious part was the,\n\n08:45.420 --> 08:49.580\n I went to the grocery store and just actually walking around\n\n08:49.580 --> 08:52.380\n and looking at food with like everything looked delicious.\n\n08:52.380 --> 08:54.420\n Even like the crappiest stuff looked delicious\n\n08:54.420 --> 08:55.700\n and I missed that.\n\n08:55.700 --> 08:58.060\n I really enjoyed that anticipation\n\n08:58.060 --> 08:59.660\n and then I picked out the meal.\n\n08:59.660 --> 09:01.100\n I went home and I cooked it\n\n09:01.100 --> 09:03.220\n and the whole thing took, I don't know,\n\n09:03.220 --> 09:05.500\n maybe two, three hours, like the whole process.\n\n09:05.500 --> 09:07.500\n And that was the most delicious part\n\n09:07.500 --> 09:08.740\n and the first taste of course.\n\n09:08.740 --> 09:13.620\n And then after it was over, there's a bit of a sadness\n\n09:13.620 --> 09:16.900\n because the part I remember is the buildup, the anticipation\n\n09:16.900 --> 09:20.020\n and then once you eat, it's over.\n\n09:20.020 --> 09:22.060\n We kind of focus on the destination\n\n09:22.060 --> 09:23.420\n but it's the whole journey.\n\n09:23.420 --> 09:25.900\n The whole like, even if you go to a restaurant,\n\n09:25.900 --> 09:29.220\n it's the conversations leading up to the meal\n\n09:29.220 --> 09:30.700\n and the first taste of the meal.\n\n09:30.700 --> 09:32.540\n That's where the joy is.\n\n09:32.540 --> 09:34.380\n And if you get to watch the making of that meal,\n\n09:34.380 --> 09:35.420\n that's incredible.\n\n09:35.420 --> 09:38.260\n That's where the smell, the visual,\n\n09:38.260 --> 09:40.260\n how the ingredients come together\n\n09:40.260 --> 09:43.460\n and especially as we were looking over the fire,\n\n09:43.460 --> 09:48.460\n like watching it, the fire play with the raw meat\n\n09:50.220 --> 09:53.940\n and over time bring out the colors, bring out the,\n\n09:53.940 --> 09:57.220\n I don't know, like you can visually associate the flavor,\n\n09:57.220 --> 10:01.180\n you know, how it becomes a little bit burnt on the outside,\n\n10:01.180 --> 10:02.820\n you know, it has a crispiness to it,\n\n10:02.820 --> 10:03.940\n it starts to gain that crispiness\n\n10:03.940 --> 10:06.220\n and immediately your past memories\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:08.620\n of the delicious crispiness of various foods you've eaten\n\n10:08.620 --> 10:10.500\n are somehow mapped into your,\n\n10:10.500 --> 10:13.180\n immediately you start to taste it visually.\n\n10:13.180 --> 10:15.180\n I don't know, yeah, that experience is magical.\n\n10:15.180 --> 10:17.780\n It's, and of course, maybe it's the Russian thing\n\n10:17.780 --> 10:20.680\n but I'm almost like saddened when it's over.\n\n10:20.680 --> 10:24.680\n I think fasting is gaining in popularity\n\n10:24.680 --> 10:27.300\n because we're having to relearn the importance\n\n10:27.300 --> 10:30.880\n of being hungry in anticipation and delight.\n\n10:30.880 --> 10:31.920\n Yeah.\n\n10:31.920 --> 10:34.400\n We have such a fear of hunger\n\n10:34.400 --> 10:37.840\n and that's really functional in evolution, right?\n\n10:37.840 --> 10:39.240\n But we have this deep fear of hunger\n\n10:39.240 --> 10:42.280\n and part of the great American experience has been\n\n10:42.280 --> 10:44.440\n that we don't have to be afraid of hunger at all\n\n10:44.440 --> 10:47.120\n because there's food everywhere and it's really cheap.\n\n10:47.120 --> 10:51.920\n In all that abundance, we've lost this edge of hunger\n\n10:51.920 --> 10:54.240\n and we don't let ourselves get hungry.\n\n10:54.240 --> 10:56.040\n And that's one thing that I learned\n\n10:56.040 --> 10:59.080\n in part of my journey as a cook and chef has been,\n\n10:59.080 --> 11:01.560\n you know, moving abroad was the first time\n\n11:01.560 --> 11:03.760\n when I lived out of the US,\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:06.560\n was the first time that I regularly experienced hunger\n\n11:06.560 --> 11:09.880\n because the time between meals was really long\n\n11:09.880 --> 11:12.120\n and that was just what everybody did.\n\n11:12.120 --> 11:14.840\n And so I was hungry for two hours before lunch.\n\n11:14.840 --> 11:16.340\n And that was the first time in my life\n\n11:16.340 --> 11:19.200\n that there hadn't just been readily available snacks.\n\n11:19.200 --> 11:21.720\n So I wonder if the intermittent fasting\n\n11:21.720 --> 11:23.760\n and part of the popularity around it,\n\n11:23.760 --> 11:26.000\n I'm sure there's all these amazing metabolic things\n\n11:26.000 --> 11:28.600\n that are happening, but also people might also feel better\n\n11:28.600 --> 11:32.300\n because they're really anticipating and enjoying food.\n\n11:32.300 --> 11:34.800\n And then if you look at the feelings of fullness,\n\n11:34.800 --> 11:37.320\n there's a really interesting thing that happens\n\n11:37.320 --> 11:41.200\n when you cook and your sense of fullness,\n\n11:41.200 --> 11:45.320\n which is if you cook and you're hungry,\n\n11:45.320 --> 11:47.240\n the experience of being around the food,\n\n11:47.240 --> 11:50.240\n smelling it, touching it, sampling it,\n\n11:50.240 --> 11:53.620\n you'll take your hunger down by 40%.\n\n11:53.620 --> 11:55.640\n And this is my own observation.\n\n11:55.640 --> 11:58.040\n But as, I mean, we've all had the experience\n\n11:58.040 --> 11:59.840\n of cooking Thanksgiving and the cook\n\n11:59.840 --> 12:01.500\n never kind of wants to eat that much Thanksgiving.\n\n12:01.500 --> 12:02.960\n That's an extreme experience.\n\n12:02.960 --> 12:05.220\n But when you really dive in and you're cooking\n\n12:05.220 --> 12:06.660\n for a few hours and you're smelling\n\n12:06.660 --> 12:07.860\n and smelling and smelling,\n\n12:07.860 --> 12:12.040\n it totally changes your threshold of satiety and fullness\n\n12:12.040 --> 12:15.520\n because of other sensory things that are happening.\n\n12:15.520 --> 12:18.560\n And for those of us looking to maintain weight\n\n12:18.560 --> 12:20.740\n and something to consider in this is that cooking\n\n12:20.740 --> 12:24.280\n is also part of what your appetite,\n\n12:24.280 --> 12:27.000\n when you're hungry, what are you hungry for, right?\n\n12:27.000 --> 12:30.000\n So we tend to think about calories, but when you're hungry,\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:33.480\n you might also be hungrier for a wider range of things.\n\n12:33.480 --> 12:36.800\n And it might be smells, it might be stopping.\n\n12:36.800 --> 12:38.720\n There's other elements and that's something,\n\n12:38.720 --> 12:42.960\n I think as a cook, that it's powerful to explore\n\n12:42.960 --> 12:46.320\n and be with and observe how your hunger changes\n\n12:46.320 --> 12:47.920\n when you're cooking.\n\n12:47.920 --> 12:49.560\n Well, let me ask the romantic question.\n\n12:49.560 --> 12:52.400\n When did you first fall in love with cooking?\n\n12:53.400 --> 12:55.340\n Me falling in love with cooking\n\n12:55.340 --> 12:58.760\n was about solving a problem in my family.\n\n12:58.760 --> 13:03.760\n And it had to do with my mom feeling very anxious\n\n13:04.000 --> 13:08.520\n about cooking and overwhelmed frequently\n\n13:08.520 --> 13:09.640\n when it came to meals.\n\n13:09.640 --> 13:13.600\n And I'm naturally very good at juggling a lot of things.\n\n13:13.600 --> 13:17.080\n And it was just something I could dive in and help\n\n13:17.080 --> 13:21.080\n and help my dad, who I'm very, very close to.\n\n13:21.080 --> 13:25.320\n So it was a very functional role where I would see\n\n13:25.320 --> 13:28.920\n this kind of crescendo of anxiety around meal times\n\n13:28.920 --> 13:33.920\n as a kid and would be able to dive in and solve things.\n\n13:33.920 --> 13:37.040\n And I also loved women who cooked.\n\n13:37.040 --> 13:39.800\n Like my father's mother was a great cook.\n\n13:39.800 --> 13:42.360\n She was, I remember her telling me as a kid,\n\n13:42.360 --> 13:45.040\n I was asking her about church and why she went to church.\n\n13:45.040 --> 13:46.400\n And she's like, I mostly go to church\n\n13:46.400 --> 13:50.560\n because I get to cook for the potlucks.\n\n13:50.560 --> 13:53.040\n And so there was an openness around that,\n\n13:53.040 --> 13:54.360\n but she just loved to cook for people\n\n13:54.360 --> 13:56.160\n and there was this real tenderness\n\n13:56.160 --> 13:57.800\n and expression of that love.\n\n13:57.800 --> 14:01.640\n So seeing women in my life who had this real tenderness\n\n14:01.640 --> 14:04.200\n and love that they shared through food\n\n14:04.200 --> 14:06.840\n and then also being able in my own home\n\n14:06.840 --> 14:09.120\n to kind of pitch in and add value\n\n14:09.120 --> 14:14.120\n and help my mom and dad was really powerful for me.\n\n14:14.400 --> 14:16.400\n Cause I felt like I had a superpower.\n\n14:16.400 --> 14:19.440\n I felt like, oh man, I just made this stressful thing\n\n14:19.440 --> 14:20.720\n go away.\n\n14:20.720 --> 14:21.880\n That was huge.\n\n14:21.880 --> 14:22.720\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n14:22.720 --> 14:24.040\n I don't know if you can comment on,\n\n14:24.040 --> 14:26.720\n especially for me growing up in Russia,\n\n14:26.720 --> 14:29.240\n it's probably true in a lot of cultures,\n\n14:29.240 --> 14:30.400\n maybe every culture.\n\n14:30.400 --> 14:33.720\n That food, and especially like in a family,\n\n14:33.720 --> 14:36.920\n the mother that cooks is the source of love\n\n14:36.920 --> 14:38.720\n and like ties the family together.\n\n14:38.720 --> 14:41.320\n It creates events where everyone comes together.\n\n14:41.320 --> 14:45.640\n It's one of the only chances of togetherness.\n\n14:45.640 --> 14:49.160\n The thing that bonds a family is like dinner\n\n14:49.160 --> 14:51.120\n or food, eating together.\n\n14:51.120 --> 14:53.080\n And I don't know what to do with that.\n\n14:53.080 --> 14:55.720\n It ties up with like dieting and so on.\n\n14:55.720 --> 14:57.120\n When I was on stricter diets,\n\n14:57.120 --> 14:59.320\n especially competing and cutting weight and stuff,\n\n14:59.320 --> 15:02.680\n it felt like I was almost like losing opportunity\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:04.560\n to connect with friends and family.\n\n15:04.560 --> 15:05.800\n It's interesting.\n\n15:05.800 --> 15:08.720\n It's almost like cultures,\n\n15:08.720 --> 15:12.400\n we cannot fully experience love and family without eating.\n\n15:12.400 --> 15:13.800\n And on the flip side of that,\n\n15:13.800 --> 15:17.680\n eating enables us to experience love and family.\n\n15:17.680 --> 15:19.200\n I don't know what to do with that.\n\n15:19.200 --> 15:20.040\n It's a tough one.\n\n15:20.040 --> 15:23.480\n Cause there's lots of layers around kind of gender roles\n\n15:23.480 --> 15:26.440\n and families changing and things.\n\n15:26.440 --> 15:29.440\n I'd say I agree around the alienation\n\n15:29.440 --> 15:31.120\n and I've done carnivore diet\n\n15:31.120 --> 15:32.800\n and I've tried some of these extreme protocols.\n\n15:32.800 --> 15:35.480\n And I too, I suffered from loneliness.\n\n15:35.480 --> 15:37.160\n It was like doing carnivore\n\n15:37.160 --> 15:40.640\n and not being able to eat what my kids ate\n\n15:40.640 --> 15:42.240\n and talk about it at the same time.\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:44.120\n Those pieces are real.\n\n15:44.120 --> 15:46.320\n And I wonder with all of these diets,\n\n15:47.280 --> 15:50.200\n if that structure is actually helping\n\n15:50.200 --> 15:52.040\n or just taking away from people's\n\n15:52.040 --> 15:54.200\n kind of sensual understanding.\n\n15:54.200 --> 15:55.720\n But I think that there's some rigor\n\n15:55.720 --> 15:57.280\n around that that helps people discover\n\n15:57.280 --> 15:59.680\n what's good for them by eliminating\n\n15:59.680 --> 16:02.400\n and then growing towards more intuitive food\n\n16:02.400 --> 16:05.320\n is a good evolution from that base.\n\n16:05.320 --> 16:08.960\n I love to cook for people.\n\n16:08.960 --> 16:13.680\n I love to pay attention to their way of being\n\n16:13.680 --> 16:15.760\n and read what they'd like to eat.\n\n16:15.760 --> 16:18.800\n And it's my purest way of love.\n\n16:18.800 --> 16:20.720\n And that's for everybody in my life.\n\n16:20.720 --> 16:23.640\n I actually love to cook for people I love.\n\n16:23.640 --> 16:27.560\n I would struggle to be putting out food all the time.\n\n16:27.560 --> 16:30.520\n It's like something for me, it's a real act of caretaking.\n\n16:30.520 --> 16:33.400\n So I definitely have that in my makeup.\n\n16:33.400 --> 16:38.400\n And I definitely notice in times of real stress,\n\n16:41.480 --> 16:43.720\n that's the piece that drops off.\n\n16:43.720 --> 16:45.560\n And it's like, if I'm unable to care for myself,\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:46.920\n I have a hard time cooking.\n\n16:46.920 --> 16:48.400\n So for me, it's very emotional.\n\n16:48.400 --> 16:49.800\n It's very connected to love.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.880\n And individualistic.\n\n16:52.880 --> 16:55.640\n So like focused on the particular individual.\n\n16:55.640 --> 16:58.040\n It's almost like a journey of understanding\n\n16:58.040 --> 17:00.200\n what that person is excited about\n\n17:00.200 --> 17:02.760\n in the landscape of flavors.\n\n17:02.760 --> 17:05.040\n Like figuring that person out, what they like,\n\n17:05.040 --> 17:06.760\n what they love to eat.\n\n17:06.760 --> 17:10.400\n Yeah, I see cooking from, I mostly cook for myself.\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:14.080\n So I see that as almost, this is gonna be like\n\n17:14.080 --> 17:17.360\n the worst term, but like an act of self love.\n\n17:17.360 --> 17:18.200\n Uh huh.\n\n17:20.200 --> 17:21.640\n This is gonna be clipped out.\n\n17:21.640 --> 17:25.640\n But that like, it's almost an exploration\n\n17:25.640 --> 17:27.960\n of like what brings me joy.\n\n17:27.960 --> 17:29.760\n And it's surprising, because I usually don't share,\n\n17:29.760 --> 17:32.640\n because the things that bring me joy\n\n17:32.640 --> 17:34.160\n are the simplest ingredients.\n\n17:34.160 --> 17:36.400\n Like I'm one of those people,\n\n17:36.400 --> 17:38.080\n I don't know if you can psychoanalyze me,\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:40.840\n because you also like basic ingredients.\n\n17:40.840 --> 17:43.600\n I like a single ingredient to ingredients,\n\n17:43.600 --> 17:45.520\n because I feel like I can deeply appreciate\n\n17:45.520 --> 17:47.360\n the particular ingredient then.\n\n17:47.360 --> 17:49.440\n I get easily distracted.\n\n17:49.440 --> 17:51.360\n You know, people who are really good listening to music,\n\n17:51.360 --> 17:52.960\n they can hear a piece of music,\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:55.680\n and in their mind, extract the different layers,\n\n17:55.680 --> 17:57.640\n and enjoy different layers at a time.\n\n17:57.640 --> 18:00.440\n Like the bass, the drums, the different layering\n\n18:00.440 --> 18:02.760\n of the piano, the beats, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n18:02.760 --> 18:04.880\n That's what it means to truly enjoy music,\n\n18:04.880 --> 18:06.680\n to listen to a piece over and over.\n\n18:06.680 --> 18:08.560\n Like almost like as a scholar.\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:10.640\n In that same way for food, I just can't do more\n\n18:10.640 --> 18:13.280\n than like three, because then it's just,\n\n18:13.280 --> 18:15.840\n I have to give in to the chaos of it, I guess.\n\n18:15.840 --> 18:17.600\n But when it's just a basic ingredient,\n\n18:17.600 --> 18:22.000\n like just meat, or just a vegetable, like basic grilled\n\n18:22.000 --> 18:24.320\n without sauces, without any of that,\n\n18:24.320 --> 18:27.280\n that I've discovered is what brings me a lot of joy.\n\n18:27.280 --> 18:29.080\n But that's boring to a lot of people.\n\n18:30.040 --> 18:33.760\n So I usually have to be kind of private about that joy.\n\n18:33.760 --> 18:36.200\n So, but that's mine, so yeah, I figured that out.\n\n18:36.200 --> 18:38.960\n I guess as a chef, you have to figure that out\n\n18:38.960 --> 18:41.880\n about everybody that you care for.\n\n18:41.880 --> 18:46.880\n Well, also for you, you're very interested in things,\n\n18:46.880 --> 18:50.120\n and interested in things being done well\n\n18:50.120 --> 18:50.960\n and appreciating them.\n\n18:50.960 --> 18:53.720\n So the single ingredient also allows you to control\n\n18:53.720 --> 18:55.400\n for perfection in cooking that,\n\n18:55.400 --> 18:58.280\n which is probably really appealing to you.\n\n18:58.280 --> 19:01.760\n And I think sometimes I see people also in the beginning\n\n19:01.760 --> 19:05.280\n of their journey of culinary trying to do too many things.\n\n19:05.280 --> 19:08.280\n So there's another piece too, that you'll notice,\n\n19:08.280 --> 19:11.200\n if you recall last night, I grilled us a salad,\n\n19:11.200 --> 19:13.520\n and then I did all those pieces separately.\n\n19:13.520 --> 19:16.240\n And that's something in general to be really attentive of\n\n19:16.240 --> 19:17.680\n when you're building flavor,\n\n19:17.680 --> 19:21.640\n to make sure you pay attention to every piece separately.\n\n19:23.000 --> 19:24.720\n The idea that you can, okay,\n\n19:24.720 --> 19:27.520\n with a soup or something or a stew, there's workarounds,\n\n19:27.520 --> 19:29.280\n but like to make a great dish\n\n19:29.280 --> 19:31.480\n that's got four or five vegetables in it,\n\n19:31.480 --> 19:35.320\n cook them all separately to their optimal deliciousness\n\n19:35.320 --> 19:36.640\n and then combine them.\n\n19:36.640 --> 19:38.280\n So that's another way to approach that,\n\n19:38.280 --> 19:39.640\n is that you may also be able to look\n\n19:39.640 --> 19:41.360\n at the different ingredients separately\n\n19:41.360 --> 19:44.520\n and still have that sense of understanding of it.\n\n19:44.520 --> 19:47.280\n But there's too often that we're layering together\n\n19:47.280 --> 19:50.680\n like four or five things and then cooking them all at once\n\n19:50.680 --> 19:52.520\n and then surprise that it's not delicious.\n\n19:52.520 --> 19:56.040\n Cause you can't really optimize on multiple variables\n\n19:56.040 --> 19:58.720\n at the same time for peak awesomeness.\n\n19:58.720 --> 20:01.200\n And that's actually, the number one way you see this\n\n20:01.200 --> 20:03.800\n is roasting a whole chicken, which is a really difficult,\n\n20:03.800 --> 20:05.720\n it's the simplest dish, but it's very difficult\n\n20:05.720 --> 20:08.640\n because you have the breast meat, which is bigger chunks.\n\n20:08.640 --> 20:09.600\n They cook faster.\n\n20:09.600 --> 20:11.440\n You have the thighs and drums,\n\n20:11.440 --> 20:14.200\n which are smaller and they cook slower.\n\n20:14.200 --> 20:16.120\n To optimize that and pay attention to it\n\n20:16.120 --> 20:17.240\n and do it all right,\n\n20:17.240 --> 20:19.440\n you're actually solving for different outcomes.\n\n20:19.440 --> 20:22.480\n So there's one example, but oftentimes food\n\n20:22.480 --> 20:25.360\n is less delicious with multiple ingredients at the start\n\n20:25.360 --> 20:27.440\n because we're not able to pay attention\n\n20:27.440 --> 20:29.760\n to how each one needs to end up.\n\n20:29.760 --> 20:31.560\n So there's a way to parse that apart\n\n20:31.560 --> 20:33.840\n and achieve a better outcome.\n\n20:33.840 --> 20:36.240\n I don't know if you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi.\n\n20:36.240 --> 20:38.240\n It's a documentary about, yeah.\n\n20:39.240 --> 20:43.200\n So there's an obsession that that particular,\n\n20:43.200 --> 20:45.560\n first of all, set of humans,\n\n20:46.480 --> 20:50.320\n but also the particular cuisine\n\n20:50.320 --> 20:52.600\n that focused on the basics of the ingredients.\n\n20:53.720 --> 20:56.560\n What do you think of that kind of trying to achieve mastery\n\n20:56.560 --> 21:00.120\n through repeating the making of the same meal\n\n21:00.120 --> 21:02.840\n over and over and over for like decades?\n\n21:02.840 --> 21:06.200\n Like, do you find beauty in that journey towards mastery\n\n21:06.200 --> 21:09.560\n or do you think it should be always an exploration\n\n21:09.560 --> 21:11.200\n to where you're always trying things,\n\n21:11.200 --> 21:14.560\n you're always kind of injecting new flavors,\n\n21:14.560 --> 21:16.720\n new experiences, all that kind of stuff?\n\n21:17.800 --> 21:19.480\n I think you have to decide on a palette.\n\n21:19.480 --> 21:20.960\n You know, if we're talking about an art,\n\n21:20.960 --> 21:24.120\n it's equivalent to saying, am I a sculptor or a painter?\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:26.560\n That, the sushi lexicon thing,\n\n21:26.560 --> 21:28.880\n that's a very, very narrow, small canvas\n\n21:28.880 --> 21:30.080\n that you're painting on.\n\n21:30.080 --> 21:32.080\n And that is a beautiful road, right?\n\n21:32.080 --> 21:34.760\n There's a beauty and a perfection to that.\n\n21:34.760 --> 21:36.680\n It's like, I mean, there's many things culturally\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:38.440\n around that that you could extrapolate\n\n21:38.440 --> 21:40.520\n for specifically for Japan.\n\n21:40.520 --> 21:44.400\n But I encourage people on the journey in food\n\n21:44.400 --> 21:47.480\n to choose like kind of a language\n\n21:47.480 --> 21:49.280\n that they're working within.\n\n21:49.280 --> 21:51.280\n And if you wanna step out of that occasionally\n\n21:51.280 --> 21:52.960\n and have one or two dishes,\n\n21:52.960 --> 21:55.240\n but if you wanna get mastery with food,\n\n21:55.240 --> 21:58.440\n you probably aren't gonna be able to get more than say,\n\n21:58.440 --> 22:00.560\n 20 ingredients that you use regularly\n\n22:00.560 --> 22:02.400\n that you really understand.\n\n22:02.400 --> 22:06.600\n And so we often see, you know, I see the American pantry,\n\n22:06.600 --> 22:08.720\n it's got tons of sauces and tons of spices\n\n22:08.720 --> 22:10.560\n and tons of spice blends.\n\n22:10.560 --> 22:13.880\n And then really people only use just a couple of things.\n\n22:13.880 --> 22:15.600\n And the idea that you can sort of splash out\n\n22:15.600 --> 22:17.760\n and do Korean one night and then tacos the next night,\n\n22:17.760 --> 22:20.680\n you can absolutely, but to get in a regular cadence\n\n22:20.680 --> 22:21.640\n of specific ingredients,\n\n22:21.640 --> 22:24.880\n you're probably gonna get more mastery with that sooner.\n\n22:24.880 --> 22:27.040\n And I think as much as you can do\n\n22:27.040 --> 22:30.840\n to get an understanding of the basics around salt and acid\n\n22:30.840 --> 22:31.880\n and understand your palette,\n\n22:31.880 --> 22:34.520\n like for me, it's lemon and usually sherry vinegar, right?\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:35.880\n So that's my acid palette.\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:39.160\n And my fat palates, you know, suet and butter, olive oil.\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:40.760\n So you can sort of choose your language,\n\n22:40.760 --> 22:42.320\n what you're painting with,\n\n22:42.320 --> 22:44.360\n but I wouldn't splash out and say, do I use sesame oil?\n\n22:44.360 --> 22:45.520\n Yeah, every once in a while,\n\n22:45.520 --> 22:48.440\n but that's not part of my base palette, right?\n\n22:48.440 --> 22:50.800\n Can you say again what your fat palette is?\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:53.680\n It'd be butter, suet and olive oil.\n\n22:53.680 --> 22:56.640\n And olive oil, so not, why olive oil?\n\n22:56.640 --> 22:58.280\n Is it your roots in Italy?\n\n22:58.280 --> 22:59.800\n I like the flavor for finish\n\n22:59.800 --> 23:02.160\n because of the bitterness that it adds.\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:05.720\n So I like the bitter and acid contrast on meat\n\n23:05.720 --> 23:07.640\n and vegetables, which is mostly what I eat.\n\n23:07.640 --> 23:11.000\n And so I love that way that the bitterness\n\n23:11.000 --> 23:12.800\n and astringency complements\n\n23:12.800 --> 23:14.280\n and allows the flavors to come out.\n\n23:14.280 --> 23:16.240\n What do you think about coconut oil?\n\n23:16.240 --> 23:19.720\n I recently discovered that there's a, I don't know,\n\n23:19.720 --> 23:21.880\n there's a sweetness or there's something to it\n\n23:21.880 --> 23:26.880\n that I really enjoy, maybe because it's new.\n\n23:27.040 --> 23:29.120\n It's good with heat.\n\n23:29.120 --> 23:31.000\n And I really love it for some reason.\n\n23:31.000 --> 23:33.680\n As a chef, do you ever try it?\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:34.520\n What do you think about it?\n\n23:34.520 --> 23:35.800\n I like it in coffee.\n\n23:35.800 --> 23:37.960\n I like it as a treat a little bit.\n\n23:37.960 --> 23:41.400\n I find the flavor a little bit challenging in foods.\n\n23:41.400 --> 23:45.120\n I also find that it's difficult\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:48.160\n on the quality of that ingredient.\n\n23:48.160 --> 23:51.280\n So I've found often that I buy a high quality coconut oil\n\n23:51.280 --> 23:53.080\n and there's rancidity in it.\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:54.160\n And I don't totally know why.\n\n23:54.160 --> 23:55.480\n I think it's just the cold chain\n\n23:55.480 --> 23:57.280\n and how that product's packaged.\n\n23:57.280 --> 24:00.080\n So I've had some issues with product quality in that.\n\n24:00.080 --> 24:03.080\n But for me, it's a little bit too much sweetness\n\n24:03.080 --> 24:05.040\n in my foods, but then again,\n\n24:05.040 --> 24:07.080\n I don't cook in like a Southeast Asian palette.\n\n24:07.080 --> 24:09.000\n I try to not have much sweetness in my foods in general.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:12.040\n So I, just because of the palette that I like to cook with.\n\n24:12.040 --> 24:14.120\n So for me, coconut's got a little bit too much\n\n24:14.120 --> 24:15.960\n of those high notes and earthiness,\n\n24:15.960 --> 24:18.320\n which is a nice combination, but it's more like a treat.\n\n24:18.320 --> 24:19.640\n Yeah, it is almost like a treat.\n\n24:19.640 --> 24:23.560\n It has a flavor of its own that almost stands on its own.\n\n24:23.560 --> 24:26.080\n Like I could probably just eat coconut.\n\n24:27.360 --> 24:29.480\n That's probably the only oil I could enjoy by itself.\n\n24:29.480 --> 24:30.360\n It sounds weird to say,\n\n24:30.360 --> 24:33.360\n but it feels like fat is often a thing\n\n24:33.360 --> 24:35.520\n that enriches the flavor of something else.\n\n24:35.520 --> 24:37.360\n Coconut can almost stand on its own.\n\n24:37.360 --> 24:39.000\n You might also be responding to that.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.720\n It's a complex flavor.\n\n24:40.720 --> 24:44.400\n So there's also, there's an analogous,\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:46.560\n you know, if you look at butter, for example,\n\n24:46.560 --> 24:48.400\n a lot of the butter that we eat in the US\n\n24:48.400 --> 24:50.280\n is just sweet cream butter.\n\n24:50.280 --> 24:51.400\n It's not cultured.\n\n24:51.400 --> 24:55.440\n If you explore like a cultured fermented butter,\n\n24:55.440 --> 24:58.160\n maybe a grass milk, grass fed and finished butter,\n\n24:58.160 --> 25:00.480\n you're gonna get a ton more complexity.\n\n25:00.480 --> 25:02.760\n And so you may also just be responding\n\n25:02.760 --> 25:05.040\n to having fats with more flavor,\n\n25:05.040 --> 25:09.120\n which is the journey in the US\n\n25:09.120 --> 25:12.760\n has been towards refined foods that are very neutral.\n\n25:12.760 --> 25:14.680\n And then you have to combine more of them\n\n25:14.680 --> 25:16.400\n to make things taste like things.\n\n25:17.320 --> 25:19.960\n And so if you're coming from a background\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:21.960\n of using mostly just generic butter\n\n25:21.960 --> 25:23.640\n or let's say canola oil to cook with,\n\n25:23.640 --> 25:25.280\n those are very neutral oils.\n\n25:25.280 --> 25:27.680\n So you can also take some of your favorite fats\n\n25:27.680 --> 25:30.040\n and look for versions of them that are more flavorful.\n\n25:30.040 --> 25:33.320\n I mean, I love olive oil as a treat in a spoon.\n\n25:33.320 --> 25:34.160\n Really?\n\n25:34.160 --> 25:35.400\n Like a good California extra virgin olive oil.\n\n25:35.400 --> 25:36.240\n I'll just like have it as,\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:37.760\n I'll eat a piece of butter as a treat.\n\n25:37.760 --> 25:38.600\n Yeah.\n\n25:38.600 --> 25:40.000\n That's like, or butter with salt on it.\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:43.120\n Like good fats can, all of them can be,\n\n25:43.120 --> 25:44.600\n if they're minimally processed\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:47.720\n and they're fabulous and it's so delicious, right?\n\n25:47.720 --> 25:49.960\n But there are things that you have to like look for\n\n25:49.960 --> 25:53.120\n a version of them that's got that full palette of flavor.\n\n25:53.120 --> 25:56.720\n Well, for me also the flavors are inextricably tied\n\n25:56.720 --> 25:58.720\n to the memories I've had with those flavors.\n\n25:58.720 --> 26:00.960\n So for better or worse,\n\n26:01.920 --> 26:04.200\n back when I used to eat a lot of ice cream,\n\n26:04.200 --> 26:06.240\n I for some reason had a lot of pleasant experience\n\n26:06.240 --> 26:07.440\n with coconut ice cream.\n\n26:07.440 --> 26:10.440\n So that particular flavor just permeates\n\n26:10.440 --> 26:11.360\n throughout my life now.\n\n26:11.360 --> 26:14.080\n Like I'm stuck with it for better or worse\n\n26:14.080 --> 26:17.440\n as a flavor that brings up pleasant memories.\n\n26:17.440 --> 26:19.640\n And as I have a few such flavors,\n\n26:19.640 --> 26:22.560\n I have such relationship with all kinds of meat too.\n\n26:22.560 --> 26:26.160\n Like it's just so many pleasant memories and that's it.\n\n26:26.160 --> 26:28.960\n Like you're almost tasting the memories.\n\n26:28.960 --> 26:33.160\n And that there's no way to separate the flavor\n\n26:33.160 --> 26:34.560\n from the memories, I suppose.\n\n26:34.560 --> 26:35.920\n And that's a powerful thing.\n\n26:35.920 --> 26:37.560\n What's your favorite meal to cook?\n\n26:39.080 --> 26:41.480\n I'll roast a couple of chickens\n\n26:41.480 --> 26:44.760\n and then I'll poach them, like I'll boil them\n\n26:44.760 --> 26:45.600\n and let it cool down.\n\n26:45.600 --> 26:47.320\n It's a complicated one.\n\n26:47.320 --> 26:48.800\n I'll let them cool down.\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:51.720\n I'll pull all the meat off, put the bones back into the pot\n\n26:51.720 --> 26:54.960\n and then cook that for like three or four hours\n\n26:54.960 --> 26:57.160\n and then add in like shiitake mushrooms\n\n26:57.160 --> 26:58.800\n and all the chicken meat.\n\n26:58.800 --> 27:01.280\n And I'll throw in a bottle of white wine\n\n27:01.280 --> 27:04.640\n into the stock as well, a bunch of thyme and garlic.\n\n27:04.640 --> 27:09.640\n And I love it because it's the way the house smells.\n\n27:09.840 --> 27:10.960\n It's very laborious.\n\n27:10.960 --> 27:14.000\n It's soothing for me to spend time picking apart meat\n\n27:14.000 --> 27:14.920\n and chopping things up.\n\n27:14.920 --> 27:17.640\n There's like a lot of manuality around it.\n\n27:17.640 --> 27:19.360\n So I'd say from a personal, like, I mean,\n\n27:19.360 --> 27:21.040\n I love grilling a steak and doing those things as well,\n\n27:21.040 --> 27:24.560\n but there's something about making a stock from scratch\n\n27:24.560 --> 27:26.760\n and the way it smells, the way I feel,\n\n27:26.760 --> 27:29.760\n the time it takes, the kind of checking in on it\n\n27:29.760 --> 27:31.380\n that I really, really love.\n\n27:31.380 --> 27:33.240\n There's many things I love to make\n\n27:33.240 --> 27:35.440\n that I don't even love to eat.\n\n27:35.440 --> 27:38.160\n I think you see this a lot in like baking and bakers,\n\n27:38.160 --> 27:40.880\n people who bake a ton and they love the process of it,\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:42.640\n even if they don't eat that many baked goods.\n\n27:42.640 --> 27:45.360\n So anything for me that's really like enjoyable\n\n27:45.360 --> 27:47.280\n is typically things like making cinnamon buns.\n\n27:47.280 --> 27:48.640\n I don't eat very many cinnamon buns,\n\n27:48.640 --> 27:51.080\n but I love making them because it takes all the sort\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:54.160\n of like futzing around and taking your time and watching it\n\n27:54.160 --> 27:56.360\n and the way it smells, the way the house smells.\n\n27:56.360 --> 27:57.880\n All of that stuff is like,\n\n27:57.880 --> 28:01.360\n it's like almost like a meditative exercise for me.\n\n28:01.360 --> 28:04.440\n Is there a science, is there an art to cooking meat well\n\n28:04.440 --> 28:05.960\n and the different kinds of meats?\n\n28:05.960 --> 28:08.080\n Is there something you can convert it towards\n\n28:09.480 --> 28:14.480\n in to say ideas, how to bring out the best of it\n\n28:15.560 --> 28:17.420\n out of what particular meat,\n\n28:17.420 --> 28:18.440\n whatever steak we're talking about,\n\n28:18.440 --> 28:20.360\n whatever beef we're talking about?\n\n28:20.360 --> 28:21.800\n Is there something that can be said?\n\n28:21.800 --> 28:26.440\n The basic approach to cooking any type of meat\n\n28:27.440 --> 28:30.500\n beyond the artistry of it is pretty scientific.\n\n28:30.500 --> 28:35.160\n And it's what type of muscle is it in the animal\n\n28:35.160 --> 28:37.360\n and what's the surface area to volume ratio?\n\n28:38.700 --> 28:40.720\n Okay, so let's look at those two questions.\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:44.080\n So the first piece is what's the type of muscle\n\n28:44.080 --> 28:44.920\n in the animal?\n\n28:44.920 --> 28:46.300\n What's the functionality?\n\n28:46.300 --> 28:49.160\n You don't necessarily need to know that to evaluate it,\n\n28:49.160 --> 28:51.520\n but you need to understand, is it a tender muscle\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:53.640\n that's not used very frequently in the animal?\n\n28:53.640 --> 28:55.200\n Or is it a big load bearing muscle\n\n28:55.200 --> 28:57.340\n that gets a lot of action, like the cheek, right?\n\n28:57.340 --> 28:59.500\n Or the shin or those pieces?\n\n29:00.360 --> 29:04.200\n The muscles like those along the spinal cord\n\n29:04.200 --> 29:06.560\n that make up rib eyes and New York steaks and things,\n\n29:06.560 --> 29:08.200\n those aren't very exercised.\n\n29:08.200 --> 29:10.160\n They're right next to the spinal cord.\n\n29:10.160 --> 29:11.680\n Spinal cord's doing most of the work there.\n\n29:11.680 --> 29:13.720\n They're kind of like stabilizing muscles\n\n29:13.720 --> 29:17.640\n around this big functional piece of skeletal structure\n\n29:17.640 --> 29:19.320\n in the animal.\n\n29:19.320 --> 29:21.720\n Other muscles, like the ones around the diaphragm\n\n29:21.720 --> 29:23.720\n with the flat iron steaks and skirt steaks and things,\n\n29:23.720 --> 29:25.640\n those are really functional muscles\n\n29:25.640 --> 29:27.340\n that are doing a ton and moving.\n\n29:27.340 --> 29:30.400\n And if they're moving a lot, what happens?\n\n29:30.400 --> 29:34.080\n Well, functionally, they've got lots of muscle sheaths\n\n29:34.080 --> 29:36.000\n because muscles that move frequently\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:39.320\n have to do a lot of like complex contraction.\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:43.020\n That's why there's, in the cheek, for example,\n\n29:43.020 --> 29:45.020\n there's tons of visible fiber\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:47.320\n of like collagenous connective tissue.\n\n29:47.320 --> 29:52.320\n That connective tissue is everything in how the meat cooks\n\n29:52.860 --> 29:56.700\n because connective tissue doesn't respond to high heat\n\n29:56.700 --> 29:58.220\n with becoming more tender.\n\n29:58.220 --> 29:59.260\n Muscles do, right?\n\n29:59.260 --> 30:00.100\n They can get a sear on them.\n\n30:00.100 --> 30:01.300\n You can cut them and eat them.\n\n30:01.300 --> 30:04.820\n The collagenous tissue will glom up and get really tough.\n\n30:04.820 --> 30:06.380\n So you either have to liquefy it\n\n30:06.380 --> 30:10.940\n with really low, slow heat with moisture, right?\n\n30:10.940 --> 30:12.620\n Or you have to barely cook it.\n\n30:12.620 --> 30:15.020\n And so that's the major piece.\n\n30:15.020 --> 30:15.860\n So that's the question of like,\n\n30:15.860 --> 30:18.220\n why wouldn't you just throw a brisket on the grill?\n\n30:18.220 --> 30:19.060\n Okay?\n\n30:19.060 --> 30:19.900\n It's not about the fat.\n\n30:19.900 --> 30:20.740\n You can cut the fat out.\n\n30:20.740 --> 30:22.500\n The reason you're not gonna throw a brisket on the grill\n\n30:22.500 --> 30:23.340\n and cook it hot and fast\n\n30:23.340 --> 30:25.980\n is it's got too much collagenous connective tissue in it.\n\n30:25.980 --> 30:28.860\n Those are these giant muscles that have all this collagen\n\n30:28.860 --> 30:31.220\n and these fibers and tendons in them effectively.\n\n30:31.220 --> 30:33.580\n So you're never gonna be able to just cook that up\n\n30:33.580 --> 30:35.180\n hot and fast.\n\n30:35.180 --> 30:36.020\n So that's the first piece.\n\n30:36.020 --> 30:38.660\n It's like, where's this muscle in the architecture\n\n30:38.660 --> 30:39.500\n of the animal?\n\n30:39.500 --> 30:42.300\n And then what does that mean for what's going on\n\n30:42.300 --> 30:43.140\n in the muscle?\n\n30:43.140 --> 30:46.820\n And that's actually more important than fat content.\n\n30:46.820 --> 30:48.020\n We get really kind of,\n\n30:48.020 --> 30:50.540\n we pay a lot of attention to fat content in muscles.\n\n30:50.540 --> 30:51.780\n You can make a steak tender\n\n30:51.780 --> 30:53.140\n if it doesn't have a ton of fat in it.\n\n30:53.140 --> 30:55.660\n It actually has more to do if there's collagenous\n\n30:55.660 --> 30:57.060\n and connective tissue in it.\n\n30:58.020 --> 30:58.860\n That's fascinating.\n\n30:58.860 --> 30:59.900\n I never even thought about that.\n\n30:59.900 --> 31:04.180\n I just, I thought it kind of universal.\n\n31:04.180 --> 31:06.900\n I mean, it adds to the texture of the meat,\n\n31:06.900 --> 31:08.620\n the chewiness of the meat.\n\n31:08.620 --> 31:12.620\n But you're saying it's also adds to how the meat is cooked.\n\n31:12.620 --> 31:15.060\n How heat, how it reacts to heat,\n\n31:15.060 --> 31:17.540\n how the entirety of the meat reacts to heat.\n\n31:17.540 --> 31:20.900\n And the fat is not as important to that as the collagen.\n\n31:20.900 --> 31:23.180\n The fat will make the flavor more delicious, right?\n\n31:23.180 --> 31:25.420\n Like it'll add unctuousness and mouthfeel\n\n31:25.420 --> 31:26.220\n and things like that.\n\n31:26.220 --> 31:28.940\n But all the connective tissue in meat\n\n31:28.940 --> 31:29.940\n and in some of the cuts,\n\n31:29.940 --> 31:31.540\n like that we ate at a skirt steak last night,\n\n31:31.540 --> 31:35.220\n you could see a web of that collagen sheath on the outside.\n\n31:35.220 --> 31:37.580\n On a ribeye, that same collagen sheath is this big.\n\n31:37.580 --> 31:38.420\n There's only one.\n\n31:38.420 --> 31:39.260\n It goes around the outside, okay?\n\n31:39.260 --> 31:42.900\n Cause it's just that muscle, there's one large muscle fiber.\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:46.900\n So that specific, it's a myelin sheath, right?\n\n31:46.900 --> 31:48.900\n That material needs moisture\n\n31:48.900 --> 31:51.540\n and low and slow heat to become tender.\n\n31:51.540 --> 31:54.020\n The other side of that is that when it becomes tender,\n\n31:54.020 --> 31:56.820\n it liquefies and it adds all this beautiful\n\n31:56.820 --> 31:58.540\n gelatinous consistency.\n\n31:58.540 --> 31:59.660\n That's what bone broth is.\n\n31:59.660 --> 32:03.980\n That's why like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so delicious.\n\n32:03.980 --> 32:05.780\n It's not that it's full of all that fat.\n\n32:05.780 --> 32:06.620\n That fat's also great.\n\n32:06.620 --> 32:09.540\n But a lot of that mouthfeel comes from that really\n\n32:09.540 --> 32:12.540\n beautiful dissolved collagen.\n\n32:12.540 --> 32:13.380\n So when you're looking at like,\n\n32:13.380 --> 32:15.620\n how do I understand how I'm gonna cook a piece of meat?\n\n32:15.620 --> 32:17.540\n That first fork in the road is,\n\n32:17.540 --> 32:20.140\n how is this gonna respond to heat?\n\n32:20.140 --> 32:23.220\n And what's the appropriate cooking technique?\n\n32:23.220 --> 32:27.300\n Then the second piece is that surface area to volume ratio.\n\n32:27.300 --> 32:30.500\n And that's important because the heat is gonna impact\n\n32:30.500 --> 32:32.900\n the meat through the surfaces of the meat\n\n32:32.900 --> 32:34.620\n that are in contact with the heat.\n\n32:34.620 --> 32:39.620\n So if I have a steak that's three inches thick,\n\n32:39.620 --> 32:42.700\n I'm gonna cook it extremely differently from a steak\n\n32:42.700 --> 32:46.300\n that's a half inch thick or three quarters of an inch thick.\n\n32:46.300 --> 32:48.180\n And that's the major, and that's the truth.\n\n32:48.180 --> 32:51.780\n If I have a piece of pork shoulder that's cut into cubes\n\n32:51.780 --> 32:53.860\n versus having a whole pork shoulder,\n\n32:53.860 --> 32:55.420\n that surface area to volume ratio,\n\n32:55.420 --> 32:58.060\n that's gonna totally change how I cook it.\n\n32:58.060 --> 33:01.620\n And same things like pot roast and a beef stew\n\n33:01.620 --> 33:03.620\n would be the same cut of meat, right?\n\n33:03.620 --> 33:05.500\n But how I cook them is gonna change\n\n33:05.500 --> 33:06.820\n based on the surface area to volume.\n\n33:06.820 --> 33:08.940\n Because you've gotta let moisture and heat\n\n33:08.940 --> 33:11.140\n work its way into the center of the meat.\n\n33:11.140 --> 33:13.620\n And that's gonna be determined by the amount of surface\n\n33:13.620 --> 33:16.020\n of the meat that's in contact with whatever cooking liquid\n\n33:16.020 --> 33:17.100\n or heat you've got.\n\n33:17.100 --> 33:19.740\n Is there different sources of heat to play with?\n\n33:19.740 --> 33:23.060\n Like a big flame versus a small,\n\n33:23.060 --> 33:25.860\n or maybe even like almost no flame,\n\n33:25.860 --> 33:27.420\n like over coals, all that kind of stuff.\n\n33:27.420 --> 33:30.900\n Is there some science to the source of heat\n\n33:30.900 --> 33:32.740\n in how it plays with the meat?\n\n33:32.740 --> 33:35.340\n Well, there's indirect heat and direct heat.\n\n33:35.340 --> 33:39.420\n And that really is mostly about temperature\n\n33:39.420 --> 33:43.060\n in more than actual, I mean, smoke is important as well\n\n33:43.060 --> 33:44.580\n that can permeate, but really the smoke\n\n33:44.580 --> 33:46.740\n doesn't go into the center of most cuts that you barbecue.\n\n33:46.740 --> 33:48.180\n It'll come in like the smoke ring.\n\n33:48.180 --> 33:52.220\n It's a maximum like half an inch on the outside,\n\n33:52.220 --> 33:54.620\n maybe a little bit deeper on a really long, slow cook.\n\n33:54.620 --> 33:58.300\n So they, but the smoke, that does create a ton of flavor\n\n33:58.300 --> 33:59.820\n on the surface of the meat.\n\n33:59.820 --> 34:02.300\n But that's, so the indirect allows you to have\n\n34:02.300 --> 34:04.660\n smoke contacting it and then a very,\n\n34:04.660 --> 34:06.260\n very low and slow heat.\n\n34:06.260 --> 34:11.260\n And what that does is indirect heat will be low\n\n34:11.820 --> 34:15.460\n and slow enough that the center of the meat will get warm\n\n34:15.460 --> 34:17.580\n at the same time as the exterior of the meat.\n\n34:17.580 --> 34:21.300\n And it'll all cook equally and all get equally tender.\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:23.460\n If you go very hot and fast,\n\n34:23.460 --> 34:26.580\n you risk the interior of the meat not getting right.\n\n34:26.580 --> 34:28.860\n You kind of create a shell on the, on it.\n\n34:28.860 --> 34:30.660\n And you slow down the interior of the meat,\n\n34:30.660 --> 34:32.020\n which you actually want to do with something\n\n34:32.020 --> 34:35.340\n like a steak where you want to keep it rare on the inside.\n\n34:35.340 --> 34:37.380\n So it's really indirect versus direct.\n\n34:37.380 --> 34:39.380\n Then once you get into direct heat, right,\n\n34:39.380 --> 34:43.780\n look at in that category, there's wood, charcoal, gas,\n\n34:43.780 --> 34:44.900\n right, that's about it.\n\n34:44.900 --> 34:47.420\n And those are meaningfully different.\n\n34:47.420 --> 34:48.700\n They're meaningfully different.\n\n34:48.700 --> 34:50.740\n Charcoal and wood, that's more of,\n\n34:50.740 --> 34:52.340\n there's more poetry and wood.\n\n34:52.340 --> 34:54.300\n There's a little bit more flavor,\n\n34:54.300 --> 34:56.100\n not functionally very different,\n\n34:56.100 --> 34:59.220\n but gas versus charcoal wood is very different.\n\n34:59.220 --> 35:02.260\n And that's because of the actual scent of the,\n\n35:02.260 --> 35:04.540\n of the cook, right, the scent of the flavor.\n\n35:04.540 --> 35:06.900\n And then there's a,\n\n35:06.900 --> 35:09.300\n I think an evenness of heat distribution\n\n35:09.300 --> 35:11.980\n that comes off of charcoal that's different from gas,\n\n35:11.980 --> 35:13.780\n because no matter how awesome your gas grill is,\n\n35:13.780 --> 35:16.380\n you do have hotter and cooler spots.\n\n35:16.380 --> 35:18.020\n So gas grills are typically,\n\n35:18.020 --> 35:19.460\n you can kind of control for that\n\n35:19.460 --> 35:21.620\n if you just are going really hot and fast,\n\n35:21.620 --> 35:22.980\n which is why gas grills are fine\n\n35:22.980 --> 35:24.500\n if you're just like throwing that steak on,\n\n35:24.500 --> 35:26.660\n get a hard sear on it, those burgers put a crust on it.\n\n35:26.660 --> 35:27.780\n Gas is fabulous for that.\n\n35:27.780 --> 35:28.780\n It's perfect.\n\n35:28.780 --> 35:30.740\n When you're doing things that do better\n\n35:30.740 --> 35:33.220\n with a low and slow cook,\n\n35:33.220 --> 35:36.540\n like let's say a whole tenderloin or chicken thigh,\n\n35:36.540 --> 35:39.980\n that's going to be a little bit less elegant on gas\n\n35:39.980 --> 35:41.540\n than on charcoal versus wood.\n\n35:41.540 --> 35:42.380\n So when you have more,\n\n35:42.380 --> 35:44.980\n more kind of nuance in the low, slow cook\n\n35:44.980 --> 35:46.580\n over the natural fuels.\n\n35:46.580 --> 35:50.700\n Talking about like smoke and flame and charcoal versus gas,\n\n35:52.100 --> 35:54.740\n it also adds to the experience and the smell\n\n35:54.740 --> 35:57.660\n and the whole thing of the cooking,\n\n35:57.660 --> 36:00.020\n like versus just like the taste it creates.\n\n36:00.020 --> 36:01.420\n There's a certain experience too,\n\n36:01.420 --> 36:03.140\n like when there's a bit of smoke,\n\n36:03.140 --> 36:04.660\n maybe I don't know what the chemistry of it is,\n\n36:04.660 --> 36:05.940\n but I feel like with smoke,\n\n36:05.940 --> 36:07.980\n the smell is distributed more effectively.\n\n36:07.980 --> 36:08.820\n I don't know if that's true,\n\n36:08.820 --> 36:13.820\n but there's a smell and a visual aspect to the experience\n\n36:13.820 --> 36:15.900\n that's almost enriched with a bit of smoke\n\n36:15.900 --> 36:18.980\n or like an open flame.\n\n36:18.980 --> 36:21.540\n Like if you can see the flame, there's magic to that.\n\n36:21.540 --> 36:23.300\n And it goes to the experience piece\n\n36:23.300 --> 36:24.140\n that we were talking about before.\n\n36:24.140 --> 36:25.940\n We were talking exactly about that,\n\n36:25.940 --> 36:29.500\n like the nuance and the beauty of like that long, slow cook\n\n36:29.500 --> 36:31.220\n and your house smelling like something.\n\n36:31.220 --> 36:33.220\n Why do people freak out about barbecue?\n\n36:33.220 --> 36:34.180\n Yeah.\n\n36:34.180 --> 36:35.020\n Why?\n\n36:35.020 --> 36:36.460\n Because you go in and it smells bomb.\n\n36:36.460 --> 36:38.140\n It smells so good.\n\n36:38.140 --> 36:39.660\n It smells like heaven, right?\n\n36:39.660 --> 36:42.900\n It smells fatty and delicious and the smells everywhere\n\n36:42.900 --> 36:44.540\n and everyone's smelling the same smell.\n\n36:44.540 --> 36:46.860\n So there's like this collective experience.\n\n36:46.860 --> 36:47.980\n It's incredible.\n\n36:47.980 --> 36:49.980\n That's, I mean, I think that's why barbecue\n\n36:49.980 --> 36:52.300\n is so sticky for people.\n\n36:52.300 --> 36:53.700\n It's like so yummy\n\n36:53.700 --> 36:56.620\n and you get this huge like anticipatory thing about it.\n\n36:56.620 --> 36:58.700\n It's like, cause it smells incredible.\n\n36:58.700 --> 37:00.780\n What was that incredible grill that we used yesterday?\n\n37:00.780 --> 37:01.620\n What is that about?\n\n37:01.620 --> 37:03.220\n That's called a Sea Island Forge.\n\n37:03.220 --> 37:05.660\n It's a wood fire grill that's inspired\n\n37:05.660 --> 37:07.700\n by like a South American style of cooking.\n\n37:07.700 --> 37:08.780\n So it's like, it's big.\n\n37:08.780 --> 37:11.500\n It has also the things with the crank.\n\n37:11.500 --> 37:13.940\n It allows you to control the distance from the flame.\n\n37:13.940 --> 37:14.780\n It's awesome.\n\n37:14.780 --> 37:15.860\n It's really key with the wood fire.\n\n37:15.860 --> 37:20.380\n So when we evolved from cooking over wood to charcoal,\n\n37:20.380 --> 37:22.940\n right, when that became more popular,\n\n37:22.940 --> 37:25.300\n the reason that we did that is that allowed us\n\n37:25.300 --> 37:28.620\n to skip the whole part of making our own charcoal, right?\n\n37:28.620 --> 37:29.940\n So when you're cooking over wood,\n\n37:29.940 --> 37:32.100\n all you're doing is making your own charcoal.\n\n37:32.100 --> 37:34.860\n You don't ever cook over wood with the red fire.\n\n37:34.860 --> 37:36.740\n Like we don't like throw a steak on\n\n37:36.740 --> 37:38.540\n when the flames are orange and leaping up\n\n37:38.540 --> 37:40.180\n because you're just gonna get, you know,\n\n37:40.180 --> 37:42.500\n carbons like char all over your meat.\n\n37:42.500 --> 37:44.020\n So you're, when you're cooking over wood,\n\n37:44.020 --> 37:45.500\n you first cook down the wood,\n\n37:45.500 --> 37:48.220\n you create the coal base, the natural coal base,\n\n37:48.220 --> 37:49.420\n and then you cook over that.\n\n37:49.420 --> 37:50.980\n So you saw yesterday, I built my fire,\n\n37:50.980 --> 37:52.660\n I let it burn down, added some fresh wood\n\n37:52.660 --> 37:56.180\n so I could reinforce my coals with new coals coming in.\n\n37:56.180 --> 37:59.140\n But then I was actually cooking over the embers.\n\n38:00.060 --> 38:04.340\n You shorten that cycle with charcoal, it's more efficient.\n\n38:04.340 --> 38:07.380\n But what you lose is that whole cycle of, you know,\n\n38:07.380 --> 38:10.500\n that really beautiful experience of smelling.\n\n38:10.500 --> 38:12.100\n Now, if you're cooking on a Traeger,\n\n38:12.100 --> 38:13.500\n you're gonna get awesome smoke smell.\n\n38:13.500 --> 38:15.820\n You know, like there's plenty of ways to do this.\n\n38:15.820 --> 38:17.020\n It doesn't always have to be wood fire.\n\n38:17.020 --> 38:19.820\n And I love all the different ways, right?\n\n38:19.820 --> 38:23.460\n But I really like the experience of the campfire.\n\n38:23.460 --> 38:25.300\n And I love that kind of just like sitting by it,\n\n38:25.300 --> 38:26.740\n building it, having to take the time.\n\n38:26.740 --> 38:28.620\n I like building the fire, going inside,\n\n38:28.620 --> 38:31.140\n preparing all my meats, bringing them out, cooking them.\n\n38:31.140 --> 38:33.060\n That whole experience start to finish\n\n38:33.060 --> 38:36.180\n is really just like something that it's my favorite.\n\n38:36.180 --> 38:38.620\n It's my favorite way to spend time, you know?\n\n38:38.620 --> 38:40.060\n So I think, and why is that?\n\n38:40.060 --> 38:41.700\n Is the food that different than cooking it\n\n38:41.700 --> 38:43.500\n in a more conventional grill?\n\n38:43.500 --> 38:45.980\n Probably not, you know, like in a pure experience.\n\n38:45.980 --> 38:48.860\n But I think the actual experience is super memorable\n\n38:48.860 --> 38:51.340\n because you are outside, you are still in your role.\n\n38:51.340 --> 38:54.660\n You're enjoying this, you know, you're just taking in,\n\n38:54.660 --> 38:56.700\n you're watching, you're anticipating.\n\n38:56.700 --> 38:58.740\n I love that whole experience.\n\n38:58.740 --> 39:03.580\n Does the origin of the meat itself make a difference?\n\n39:03.580 --> 39:05.580\n So we're here at Belcampo Farms\n\n39:05.580 --> 39:10.220\n and we'll, maybe you could talk about what your vision,\n\n39:10.220 --> 39:14.580\n your dream is in terms of like food,\n\n39:14.580 --> 39:16.820\n in terms of where food comes from,\n\n39:16.820 --> 39:19.140\n where meat comes from, but food broadly,\n\n39:19.140 --> 39:23.340\n and how that affects the entirety of the culinary journey.\n\n39:25.180 --> 39:27.380\n On the question of where does it come from\n\n39:27.380 --> 39:31.780\n and does that matter, I'd say the way that meat is raised\n\n39:31.780 --> 39:35.540\n is massively important for flavor and for how it cooks.\n\n39:36.420 --> 39:41.420\n I think most cooks who try cooking grass fed\n\n39:41.940 --> 39:44.460\n versus corn fed, that's the first moment\n\n39:44.460 --> 39:45.860\n where they realize that, right?\n\n39:45.860 --> 39:48.900\n Where corn fed meat cooks much more slowly,\n\n39:48.900 --> 39:53.020\n it's got bigger veins of fat that slow the heat transfer\n\n39:53.020 --> 39:54.980\n throughout the muscle of the animal,\n\n39:54.980 --> 39:56.580\n compared to grass fed, which is leaner,\n\n39:56.580 --> 39:58.300\n heat moves through it more quickly,\n\n39:58.300 --> 40:00.220\n those steaks will cook much, much faster.\n\n40:00.220 --> 40:03.660\n So there's very kind of technical reasons why,\n\n40:03.660 --> 40:07.220\n how meat is raised that we're aware of.\n\n40:07.220 --> 40:09.620\n And there's other things that I've noticed,\n\n40:09.620 --> 40:13.620\n like that slower growing poultry\n\n40:13.620 --> 40:16.740\n has a very, very different musculature and fiber to it\n\n40:16.740 --> 40:19.940\n than fast growing poultry, that's confinement animals.\n\n40:19.940 --> 40:21.820\n It's just, it has to do with the way\n\n40:21.820 --> 40:22.780\n that the muscles are built.\n\n40:22.780 --> 40:26.060\n They tend to be finer and thinner and more tender\n\n40:26.060 --> 40:28.020\n and a little bit more susceptible to heat.\n\n40:28.020 --> 40:32.300\n So the character of the meat's radically different.\n\n40:32.300 --> 40:34.020\n It's also much more flavorful\n\n40:34.020 --> 40:35.700\n when it's grown more naturally.\n\n40:35.700 --> 40:39.260\n And I think some of the reliance in the US\n\n40:39.260 --> 40:42.220\n on like sugary sauces and lots of salts\n\n40:42.220 --> 40:45.860\n and flavors and things like that's actually based\n\n40:45.860 --> 40:50.020\n on having the broadly available meat out there\n\n40:50.020 --> 40:51.660\n is pretty low on flavor.\n\n40:51.660 --> 40:54.420\n And so we're adding in a lot to compensate for that.\n\n40:54.420 --> 40:57.900\n So to your point of like enjoying things very simply\n\n40:57.900 --> 41:01.620\n and with like salt and nothing else,\n\n41:01.620 --> 41:03.620\n like the more flavorful that product is,\n\n41:03.620 --> 41:06.540\n I think the more people will find that enjoyable.\n\n41:06.540 --> 41:08.260\n Let's paint a vision.\n\n41:08.260 --> 41:09.420\n I mean, you're a visionary.\n\n41:09.420 --> 41:14.420\n You have a vision to have basically meat in every store\n\n41:14.940 --> 41:19.180\n that comes from a farm like Belcampo\n\n41:19.180 --> 41:22.340\n that's basically doing regenerative farming.\n\n41:22.340 --> 41:24.140\n How do we get there?\n\n41:24.140 --> 41:27.380\n It's about a network of smaller producers\n\n41:27.380 --> 41:31.180\n working together with shared values.\n\n41:31.180 --> 41:36.180\n And it's true that there's a limit on regenerative farming\n\n41:36.180 --> 41:39.980\n in that it requires more human knowledge.\n\n41:39.980 --> 41:44.620\n So regenerative farming is more difficult to scale\n\n41:44.620 --> 41:46.140\n in a single operation.\n\n41:46.140 --> 41:48.140\n It'd be really challenging to have a regenerative farm\n\n41:48.140 --> 41:50.140\n that was like 200,000 acres\n\n41:50.140 --> 41:53.460\n because of the amount of manpower needed to pay attention.\n\n41:53.460 --> 41:55.540\n Can you first, and I apologize to interrupt,\n\n41:55.540 --> 41:58.740\n but can you say what is regenerative farming?\n\n41:58.740 --> 41:59.740\n Sure.\n\n41:59.740 --> 42:04.740\n So if you're looking at scaling regenerative farming,\n\n42:04.740 --> 42:07.180\n it's a traditional system of agriculture.\n\n42:07.180 --> 42:09.380\n Regenerative farming is how we used to farm.\n\n42:10.780 --> 42:14.260\n We used to farm with an eye towards the longterm.\n\n42:15.300 --> 42:19.060\n You might be on the Friedman farm thinking about your heirs\n\n42:19.060 --> 42:22.900\n five generations from now farming that same land.\n\n42:22.900 --> 42:26.300\n Are you gonna leave that land nutritionally empty?\n\n42:26.300 --> 42:28.980\n No, it's a longterm thinking.\n\n42:28.980 --> 42:32.500\n Also in traditional ag, you don't have inputs.\n\n42:32.500 --> 42:35.740\n That are very convenient. You can put some chicken manure on,\n\n42:35.740 --> 42:40.100\n but you can't spray or dump something that massively\n\n42:40.100 --> 42:43.580\n increases the growing potential of the land.\n\n42:45.300 --> 42:49.580\n That was not available until the past 60 years.\n\n42:49.580 --> 42:54.580\n So regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming\n\n42:54.980 --> 42:58.620\n where you're increasing soil fertility through your farming.\n\n42:58.620 --> 43:02.460\n You increase soil fertility by feeding the soil.\n\n43:02.460 --> 43:04.940\n You feed the soil through carbon.\n\n43:06.380 --> 43:08.100\n That's why regenerative farming is better\n\n43:08.100 --> 43:08.940\n for the environment.\n\n43:08.940 --> 43:12.020\n It sequesters carbon and puts carbon into the soil.\n\n43:12.980 --> 43:14.620\n Now it's interesting.\n\n43:14.620 --> 43:18.620\n Plants need carbon and put it into the soil\n\n43:18.620 --> 43:20.420\n when they're going through growth.\n\n43:21.460 --> 43:23.620\n So if you have a beautiful field of grass\n\n43:23.620 --> 43:25.220\n that's just waving in the wind,\n\n43:25.220 --> 43:26.620\n that's where you're gonna get the most\n\n43:26.620 --> 43:28.820\n of the carbon that's going into the soil.\n\n43:28.820 --> 43:30.740\n That's not sequestering as much carbon\n\n43:30.740 --> 43:34.620\n as plants that have been damaged and are regrowing.\n\n43:34.620 --> 43:36.420\n Plants that have been damaged and are regrowing\n\n43:36.420 --> 43:38.580\n are repairing and they're doing that\n\n43:38.580 --> 43:41.340\n by drawing down carbon as one of the nutrients\n\n43:41.340 --> 43:42.180\n that feeds them.\n\n43:43.140 --> 43:45.300\n To damage the plants effectively,\n\n43:45.300 --> 43:47.780\n that's what we're doing with regenerative grazing.\n\n43:49.300 --> 43:53.700\n So the cows or, you know, lambs or whatever out there,\n\n43:53.700 --> 43:57.540\n they're eating and taking the grass down\n\n43:57.540 --> 43:59.700\n and that then cause a regrowth cycle\n\n43:59.700 --> 44:01.180\n that sequesters carbon.\n\n44:01.180 --> 44:02.020\n Wow.\n\n44:02.020 --> 44:02.860\n There's a limit to it.\n\n44:02.860 --> 44:03.700\n There's an edge,\n\n44:03.700 --> 44:05.780\n because if those plants are so damaged\n\n44:05.780 --> 44:07.180\n that they can't regrow,\n\n44:07.180 --> 44:08.620\n then it turns into a dirt patch\n\n44:08.620 --> 44:10.220\n and that doesn't sequester any carbon.\n\n44:10.220 --> 44:11.220\n So it's a balance.\n\n44:11.220 --> 44:13.300\n How do you find that balance?\n\n44:13.300 --> 44:15.860\n That has to do with like the frequency\n\n44:15.860 --> 44:18.020\n and the scale of the grazing essentially?\n\n44:18.020 --> 44:19.460\n Exactly.\n\n44:19.460 --> 44:20.860\n And so you have to find the right balance\n\n44:20.860 --> 44:24.340\n and that connects to both the grass.\n\n44:24.340 --> 44:27.100\n I mean, is the ultimately the focus here\n\n44:27.100 --> 44:30.100\n is on the life cycle of whatever is grazing,\n\n44:30.100 --> 44:32.740\n whether it's cows or lambs or so on?\n\n44:32.740 --> 44:34.540\n That's why the scalability question.\n\n44:34.540 --> 44:37.220\n So all that stuff that I just talked about,\n\n44:37.220 --> 44:39.740\n like think about all the actions that that requires.\n\n44:39.740 --> 44:42.500\n Somebody's out there looking and paying attention\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:45.540\n and understanding how far the grass is,\n\n44:45.540 --> 44:47.980\n remembering what happened in that field last year.\n\n44:47.980 --> 44:50.380\n There's a huge human intelligence need\n\n44:50.380 --> 44:55.380\n and human kind of availability of attention.\n\n44:55.820 --> 44:58.820\n Now, industrial farming has done a great job\n\n44:58.820 --> 45:00.860\n at de skilling agriculture.\n\n45:03.180 --> 45:05.020\n Industrial farming has taken agriculture\n\n45:05.020 --> 45:09.420\n from being art science to being entry level employment.\n\n45:10.980 --> 45:11.820\n Yeah.\n\n45:11.820 --> 45:13.740\n So that's the limiting factor on regen\n\n45:13.740 --> 45:14.580\n and that's why I think...\n\n45:14.580 --> 45:15.900\n It's a human intelligence piece.\n\n45:15.900 --> 45:16.820\n Exactly.\n\n45:16.820 --> 45:18.100\n I gotta ask,\n\n45:18.100 --> 45:19.540\n I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff.\n\n45:19.540 --> 45:20.540\n I mentioned to you offline\n\n45:20.540 --> 45:23.020\n that I spent a bit of time with some robots\n\n45:23.020 --> 45:24.100\n and Boston Dynamics.\n\n45:24.100 --> 45:25.180\n Do you think there's a way\n\n45:25.180 --> 45:27.620\n to use artificial intelligence to help?\n\n45:27.620 --> 45:29.100\n So data collection,\n\n45:29.100 --> 45:33.820\n so automating some of the things that makes humans special,\n\n45:33.820 --> 45:34.940\n make some of that decision,\n\n45:34.940 --> 45:36.600\n some of that memory that's then utilized,\n\n45:36.600 --> 45:38.380\n converges to knowledge to make decisions\n\n45:38.380 --> 45:39.980\n about the crops and so on.\n\n45:39.980 --> 45:41.940\n Is there a way AI can help?\n\n45:41.940 --> 45:42.760\n Do you think?\n\n45:42.760 --> 45:43.600\n Totally.\n\n45:43.600 --> 45:45.780\n I mean, that would be incredible.\n\n45:45.780 --> 45:47.180\n That's one of the ingredients\n\n45:47.180 --> 45:48.620\n that could help with the regenerative farming.\n\n45:48.620 --> 45:50.940\n A number of discrete decision points\n\n45:50.940 --> 45:54.740\n that could completely be automated as well\n\n45:54.740 --> 45:56.700\n in order to supplement and work with somebody,\n\n45:56.700 --> 45:58.660\n like a farmer in managing it,\n\n45:58.660 --> 46:01.300\n about the performance on land.\n\n46:01.300 --> 46:02.660\n And a bit of that's being done right now\n\n46:02.660 --> 46:04.820\n with some aerial mapping,\n\n46:04.820 --> 46:07.900\n but that type of AI would be huge in this.\n\n46:07.900 --> 46:11.780\n I mean, there's estimates that if the damage\n\n46:11.780 --> 46:14.100\n and underutilized rangeland in the world\n\n46:14.100 --> 46:15.900\n was converted to regenerative agriculture\n\n46:15.900 --> 46:19.300\n somewhere between like 20 and 40% of the world's carbon\n\n46:19.300 --> 46:20.620\n could be sequestered.\n\n46:20.620 --> 46:22.480\n So there's a huge potential.\n\n46:22.480 --> 46:24.840\n The problem is cultural.\n\n46:26.660 --> 46:29.660\n We've like lost the generational thread of knowledge\n\n46:29.660 --> 46:30.740\n about how to do this.\n\n46:30.740 --> 46:31.900\n It's kind of been two generations\n\n46:31.900 --> 46:34.140\n that haven't farmed this way.\n\n46:34.140 --> 46:38.020\n Also the science around it is limited\n\n46:38.020 --> 46:40.460\n by the scale and longevity.\n\n46:40.460 --> 46:43.060\n So the data collection around regenerative farming\n\n46:43.060 --> 46:45.980\n is also limited by the fact it's kind of piecemeal.\n\n46:45.980 --> 46:48.040\n There's small operations that are doing it.\n\n46:48.040 --> 46:50.160\n They're learning and developing as they go,\n\n46:50.160 --> 46:51.620\n and they haven't been documenting it\n\n46:51.620 --> 46:53.460\n and doing it for too long.\n\n46:53.460 --> 46:55.780\n Is the ethical treatment of animals\n\n46:55.780 --> 46:58.760\n a part of regenerative farming?\n\n46:58.760 --> 47:01.620\n So in the way you do things at Belcampo,\n\n47:01.620 --> 47:02.660\n that's a huge part.\n\n47:03.820 --> 47:05.700\n Is that necessarily part of the life cycle?\n\n47:05.700 --> 47:08.100\n So like the things that you're trying to measure\n\n47:08.100 --> 47:13.100\n is like the way, like not damaging the land too much,\n\n47:13.980 --> 47:16.420\n make sure that the sort of the land\n\n47:16.420 --> 47:17.980\n is constantly healthy and is producing,\n\n47:17.980 --> 47:20.340\n and then the grazing process,\n\n47:20.340 --> 47:22.300\n and also the carbon piece,\n\n47:22.300 --> 47:25.760\n the fact that it's a carbon neutral or something like that.\n\n47:25.760 --> 47:28.780\n I mean, are all of those pieces of the regenerative farming\n\n47:28.780 --> 47:31.500\n or is this an extra part to your vision\n\n47:31.500 --> 47:32.340\n that you're thinking about?\n\n47:32.340 --> 47:34.140\n It's all implicit and regenerative.\n\n47:34.140 --> 47:37.380\n I call it out separately because we are certified humane,\n\n47:37.380 --> 47:38.860\n which is another layer of welfare\n\n47:38.860 --> 47:41.600\n that has to do with density and a couple other things.\n\n47:41.600 --> 47:44.060\n But regenerative, I mean, think about it.\n\n47:44.060 --> 47:46.020\n If you're a cow and you're in a regenerative operation\n\n47:46.020 --> 47:49.140\n where the whole life cycle of the pasture\n\n47:49.140 --> 47:52.540\n means that you only eat the top six inches of the grass,\n\n47:52.540 --> 47:54.460\n and then when there's whatever, a couple inches left,\n\n47:54.460 --> 47:56.360\n then that field is left dormant.\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:58.060\n That's a better experience, right?\n\n47:58.060 --> 48:00.100\n So just think about it kind of functionally that way.\n\n48:00.100 --> 48:02.820\n Well, grazing period is a better experience, right?\n\n48:02.820 --> 48:05.560\n And that's not what's done in,\n\n48:05.560 --> 48:06.980\n I mean, that's the grass fed piece, right?\n\n48:06.980 --> 48:11.980\n That's the other piece with certified organics, amazing.\n\n48:12.300 --> 48:14.620\n There's plenty of certifications\n\n48:14.620 --> 48:17.500\n that grass fed and finished is also great,\n\n48:17.500 --> 48:19.140\n but there are workarounds for those.\n\n48:19.140 --> 48:21.300\n You can have certified organic feedlots.\n\n48:21.300 --> 48:22.760\n You can have grass fed and finished,\n\n48:22.760 --> 48:25.880\n which is an animal fed a grass seed pellet.\n\n48:26.860 --> 48:29.020\n Those aren't things that we do here, right?\n\n48:29.020 --> 48:30.800\n And regenerative captures that.\n\n48:30.800 --> 48:32.660\n Because if you're, it's like anything,\n\n48:32.660 --> 48:35.540\n you're isolating these very specific certifications,\n\n48:35.540 --> 48:37.580\n it doesn't have a holistic approach.\n\n48:37.580 --> 48:40.220\n Regenerative though, unfortunately, isn't certified yet.\n\n48:40.220 --> 48:42.760\n We've gotten USDA approval to use that word\n\n48:42.760 --> 48:45.140\n based on our carbon sequestration data,\n\n48:45.140 --> 48:47.780\n but it's not a regulated term.\n\n48:47.780 --> 48:49.540\n So that's kind of the mix right now\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:51.540\n is to figure out how to document it.\n\n48:51.540 --> 48:53.780\n And it's not totally clear what it means\n\n48:53.780 --> 48:56.700\n like for pigs and chickens, which are omnivores.\n\n48:56.700 --> 48:58.140\n It's very clear for ruminants,\n\n48:58.140 --> 49:01.020\n which are animals that have a rumen that eat grass.\n\n49:01.020 --> 49:03.500\n For omnivores, which is like what we are,\n\n49:03.500 --> 49:05.980\n they eat primarily grain in farming operations,\n\n49:05.980 --> 49:07.740\n and that's a little bit more complex.\n\n49:07.740 --> 49:09.380\n So it's kind of a moving landscape,\n\n49:09.380 --> 49:13.820\n but regenerative as a word is the better definition\n\n49:13.820 --> 49:15.320\n of the whole life cycle approach\n\n49:15.320 --> 49:18.060\n of letting animals and nature work together.\n\n49:18.060 --> 49:20.880\n Is it true that it's possible to have a farm\n\n49:20.880 --> 49:25.300\n that doesn't produce, sort of is carbon neutral?\n\n49:25.300 --> 49:28.540\n We have been third party verified\n\n49:28.540 --> 49:31.060\n to be carbon impact negative.\n\n49:31.060 --> 49:34.300\n So Belcampo's 25,000 acres and the animals here,\n\n49:36.300 --> 49:38.620\n all of the carbon, including from our shipping\n\n49:38.620 --> 49:40.860\n on our mail order is all offset\n\n49:40.860 --> 49:43.300\n by the amount of grazing that's happening.\n\n49:43.300 --> 49:45.100\n Also that encompasses our partner farms.\n\n49:45.100 --> 49:49.040\n We buy a number of live animals in from other partner farms.\n\n49:49.040 --> 49:51.060\n That's their impacts also incorporated in that.\n\n49:51.060 --> 49:52.900\n I mean, first of all, that's incredible.\n\n49:52.900 --> 49:55.100\n And second of all, is that possible to scale?\n\n49:55.100 --> 49:57.460\n I don't see why it isn't.\n\n49:57.460 --> 50:00.580\n I mean, it's complex to scale,\n\n50:00.580 --> 50:02.540\n but I mean, we're putting people on the moon\n\n50:02.540 --> 50:04.780\n and you have a robotic dog.\n\n50:04.780 --> 50:05.620\n I mean.\n\n50:05.620 --> 50:09.940\n But that's less about scale, that's more about innovation.\n\n50:09.940 --> 50:12.660\n So like in many ways what Belcampo has done\n\n50:12.660 --> 50:14.460\n is innovative at a small scale.\n\n50:14.460 --> 50:16.460\n The question is whether that innovation can be scaled.\n\n50:16.460 --> 50:20.100\n That's where I feel like we in the industry need more help.\n\n50:20.100 --> 50:23.140\n You know, the AI piece, the intelligence,\n\n50:23.140 --> 50:27.500\n the thinking about ways to do things differently\n\n50:27.500 --> 50:29.220\n is where we need more support.\n\n50:29.220 --> 50:31.460\n And I think it's been a, you know,\n\n50:31.460 --> 50:36.460\n a kind of a swing in the past couple of years\n\n50:37.100 --> 50:40.620\n where it's like meat's a mess, it's terrible.\n\n50:40.620 --> 50:44.180\n So let's ditch meat and opt for these hyper process,\n\n50:44.180 --> 50:46.580\n you know, plant based solutions.\n\n50:46.580 --> 50:50.540\n And I am saying there's a way to make meat\n\n50:50.540 --> 50:52.460\n a part of the solution.\n\n50:52.460 --> 50:54.580\n And it's gonna mean eating less of it.\n\n50:54.580 --> 50:56.100\n It's gonna mean paying more for it.\n\n50:56.100 --> 50:57.460\n It's gonna mean that the farming systems\n\n50:57.460 --> 50:59.000\n are more complicated.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.580\n It's not the easiest path,\n\n51:00.580 --> 51:03.200\n but I think in the long term it's the better path.\n\n51:03.200 --> 51:05.340\n And it's also better for human health.\n\n51:05.340 --> 51:07.860\n Can you comment on the certified humane piece?\n\n51:07.860 --> 51:11.220\n So how do you run a farm?\n\n51:11.220 --> 51:13.980\n Like what does it mean to raise an animal\n\n51:13.980 --> 51:17.020\n from the beginning of its life to the end of its life\n\n51:17.020 --> 51:18.980\n in a way that's ethical, that's humane?\n\n51:18.980 --> 51:22.740\n I think the first piece you need to just be comfortable with\n\n51:22.740 --> 51:27.000\n is that making an animal into meat, you know,\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:28.620\n is something that you're comfortable with.\n\n51:28.620 --> 51:30.820\n Cause I think that's the biggest question, right?\n\n51:30.820 --> 51:34.180\n And so certified humane actually goes all the way through\n\n51:34.180 --> 51:35.360\n the death of the animal,\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:37.540\n how it's killed and handled at processing.\n\n51:37.540 --> 51:39.580\n So I put that out there just to say,\n\n51:39.580 --> 51:43.700\n well, this is all about producing an animal to die for meat.\n\n51:43.700 --> 51:45.300\n And that's not necessarily,\n\n51:45.300 --> 51:47.340\n that's something people struggle with with the word humane.\n\n51:47.340 --> 51:48.180\n And I understand that.\n\n51:48.180 --> 51:49.780\n Like I have space and empathy for that.\n\n51:49.780 --> 51:51.740\n It's a complicated decision.\n\n51:51.740 --> 51:53.700\n And when you have to be comfortable with at the outset\n\n51:53.700 --> 51:56.240\n to say, this is an animal that's gonna die to feed me.\n\n51:56.240 --> 51:58.100\n Yeah, so we should pause on that\n\n51:58.100 --> 52:01.940\n cause I actually just the two days ago read a paper\n\n52:01.940 --> 52:03.980\n that argued that, you know,\n\n52:03.980 --> 52:06.660\n the killing of an animal period cannot be humane.\n\n52:06.660 --> 52:07.740\n So it's impossible.\n\n52:07.740 --> 52:10.580\n And so, and that's an argument just like you're saying\n\n52:10.580 --> 52:14.140\n we could make, but if we now on the table kind of\n\n52:15.780 --> 52:18.940\n take as a starting point, the idea that\n\n52:20.380 --> 52:24.020\n it's possible to kill an animal for food in an ethical way,\n\n52:24.020 --> 52:25.780\n if we take that as a starting point.\n\n52:25.780 --> 52:27.360\n So we won't argue about that.\n\n52:27.360 --> 52:29.500\n It is worth arguing about it elsewhere.\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:30.720\n And it probably will.\n\n52:30.720 --> 52:33.180\n I will probably talk to a few vegan folks\n\n52:33.180 --> 52:35.200\n and we'll talk about the vegan diet.\n\n52:35.200 --> 52:36.580\n I'm fascinated by it as well.\n\n52:36.580 --> 52:37.980\n So I'm torn in the whole thing.\n\n52:37.980 --> 52:41.060\n But if we just take that as a starting point,\n\n52:41.060 --> 52:45.300\n what then is an ethical humane way to treat an animal?\n\n52:45.300 --> 52:48.240\n I look at ethical humane animal treatment\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:51.340\n as the major phases of life.\n\n52:51.340 --> 52:55.920\n So conception, birth and mothering,\n\n52:55.920 --> 53:00.920\n diet, those are kind of the major touch points of life.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:06.000\n So what we're looking at is evolutionary approach,\n\n53:07.760 --> 53:09.480\n which means is the animal eating\n\n53:09.480 --> 53:11.480\n what it evolved to eat primarily?\n\n53:12.340 --> 53:15.480\n Is the animal primarily outdoors,\n\n53:15.480 --> 53:18.140\n which is how all animals evolved,\n\n53:18.140 --> 53:20.160\n given when the climate's appropriate for it.\n\n53:20.160 --> 53:22.520\n There's certain times when you can't have animals\n\n53:22.520 --> 53:24.360\n fully outdoors, like here on our ranch,\n\n53:24.360 --> 53:28.320\n we have had issues with cold weather and things.\n\n53:28.320 --> 53:31.840\n But so if you have appropriate weather conditions,\n\n53:31.840 --> 53:33.600\n does the animal outdoors?\n\n53:33.600 --> 53:37.080\n Is the animal able to nurture and engage with its young?\n\n53:37.080 --> 53:38.680\n Those are the kind of key touch points,\n\n53:38.680 --> 53:40.560\n but it's really the birth of it.\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:42.400\n Let me start this one from the scratch.\n\n53:43.560 --> 53:45.400\n Okay, so when I'm looking at,\n\n53:45.400 --> 53:47.120\n or when I consider what's humane,\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:48.920\n setting aside the death part,\n\n53:48.920 --> 53:51.480\n I look at the evolutionary diet,\n\n53:51.480 --> 53:54.160\n access to the outdoors,\n\n53:55.240 --> 53:59.500\n and ideally spending the majority of its life outdoors,\n\n53:59.500 --> 54:02.300\n low density, so animals spread out,\n\n54:03.160 --> 54:07.320\n and engagement with young, social interactions,\n\n54:07.320 --> 54:08.160\n and that's all kind of simplistic.\n\n54:08.160 --> 54:09.600\n Social interaction is a cool one.\n\n54:09.600 --> 54:12.200\n I mean, I also read an article that like,\n\n54:12.200 --> 54:16.560\n cows, for example, have social, like they have friends.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:17.960\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n54:17.960 --> 54:18.800\n That's fascinating.\n\n54:18.800 --> 54:20.640\n I mean, that piece with the young,\n\n54:20.640 --> 54:21.700\n social interaction with young,\n\n54:21.700 --> 54:23.600\n social interaction with each other,\n\n54:23.600 --> 54:25.400\n that at a basic level,\n\n54:25.400 --> 54:28.080\n I'm sure that interaction is not as rich as humans,\n\n54:28.080 --> 54:31.680\n but that piece seems to be part of the humane picture.\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:34.280\n And you said also, just a quick comment,\n\n54:34.280 --> 54:37.520\n evolutionary diet, meaning the diet\n\n54:37.520 --> 54:40.120\n that they were evolved to have.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:41.700\n And that's pretty simple.\n\n54:41.700 --> 54:43.960\n You can look at the physiology of the animal\n\n54:43.960 --> 54:45.180\n and figure that out.\n\n54:45.180 --> 54:48.680\n So ruminant species are lamb, goats, and beef,\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:50.980\n and they have five stomachs.\n\n54:50.980 --> 54:55.200\n They evolved eating really low calorie, high fiber foods.\n\n54:55.200 --> 54:56.720\n That's why they've got all the stomachs.\n\n54:56.720 --> 54:58.000\n They need a lot of processing.\n\n54:58.000 --> 55:00.920\n You or I were to eat grass, we die in a week, right?\n\n55:00.920 --> 55:02.580\n Our physiology can't handle it.\n\n55:02.580 --> 55:05.920\n Cows were built and evolved to eat this very low calorie,\n\n55:05.920 --> 55:08.800\n very high fiber, very low density food.\n\n55:08.800 --> 55:10.760\n And they walk around slowly,\n\n55:10.760 --> 55:13.500\n they're moving constantly and they're eating it.\n\n55:13.500 --> 55:15.760\n When we put them on a corn fed diet,\n\n55:15.760 --> 55:17.840\n that's the opposite of their evolutionary diet\n\n55:17.840 --> 55:19.880\n and their systems really struggle with it.\n\n55:19.880 --> 55:22.260\n Now, pigs and chickens are different.\n\n55:22.260 --> 55:23.840\n Pigs and chickens are omnivores\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:29.720\n and pigs will happily eat chickens, for example.\n\n55:30.620 --> 55:33.520\n Our pigs on the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes\n\n55:33.520 --> 55:34.360\n and eat them.\n\n55:37.520 --> 55:39.360\n They enjoy all of it.\n\n55:39.360 --> 55:40.680\n They're omnivores.\n\n55:40.680 --> 55:42.040\n So that you often see,\n\n55:42.040 --> 55:45.240\n and I've seen people try to raise like a grass fed chicken\n\n55:45.240 --> 55:46.880\n and that doesn't exist.\n\n55:46.880 --> 55:50.000\n I mean, they need a higher, omnivores eat everything.\n\n55:50.000 --> 55:51.400\n They're what's called monogastric.\n\n55:51.400 --> 55:53.080\n They got one stomach\n\n55:53.080 --> 55:56.320\n and that one stomach needs higher density nutrients.\n\n55:56.320 --> 55:58.360\n So in the case of chicken,\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:02.200\n if you're to do, look back in American history\n\n56:02.200 --> 56:04.080\n and in the 1950s, it took,\n\n56:04.080 --> 56:05.920\n commercial chickens took like 54 weeks\n\n56:05.920 --> 56:07.680\n to come to full weight.\n\n56:07.680 --> 56:10.540\n Now it's two and a half weeks in confinement farming\n\n56:10.540 --> 56:14.160\n on our systems, it's like eight to 10 weeks typically.\n\n56:14.160 --> 56:15.280\n So it's a very,\n\n56:15.280 --> 56:17.680\n you have to give them some amount of nutrient density,\n\n56:17.680 --> 56:20.640\n but there's the idea that no grain,\n\n56:20.640 --> 56:22.760\n because that's a misinformation\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:25.200\n for any type of commercial operation,\n\n56:25.200 --> 56:27.500\n free range, regenerative, pastured, everything,\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:30.440\n you're gonna have to have a grain feed to get any type of,\n\n56:30.440 --> 56:32.320\n it's actually, I think for the case of chickens,\n\n56:32.320 --> 56:34.460\n unless you're in a place with like tons of natural seeds\n\n56:34.460 --> 56:36.640\n and grubs and worms and stuff to eat,\n\n56:36.640 --> 56:38.420\n really challenging for the chicken.\n\n56:38.420 --> 56:40.040\n So you gotta give them some high density,\n\n56:40.040 --> 56:41.680\n high calorie food different from that.\n\n56:41.680 --> 56:44.600\n That's the evolutionary diet is a really key thing.\n\n56:44.600 --> 56:46.680\n That's the fundamental thing for health.\n\n56:46.680 --> 56:47.640\n And it's also interesting\n\n56:47.640 --> 56:51.120\n because the evolutionary diet ties to human health.\n\n56:51.120 --> 56:52.720\n I've looked at the nutritional analysis\n\n56:52.720 --> 56:55.840\n on all of our products and it's,\n\n56:55.840 --> 57:00.840\n the evolutionary diet is for the case of beef and lamb\n\n57:01.440 --> 57:03.880\n gets their omega three to six ratios,\n\n57:03.880 --> 57:05.160\n the same as wild game.\n\n57:06.640 --> 57:08.640\n So it's not like beef is really radically different\n\n57:08.640 --> 57:11.500\n from elk, a ruminant species, right?\n\n57:11.500 --> 57:14.560\n If you feed beef an evolutionary diet,\n\n57:14.560 --> 57:16.680\n their nutritional profile is the same as wild meat.\n\n57:16.680 --> 57:18.160\n There's a wild ruminant.\n\n57:18.160 --> 57:20.380\n I got a chance to witness Neuralink,\n\n57:20.380 --> 57:21.880\n I don't know if you're familiar with that company,\n\n57:21.880 --> 57:23.880\n the brain computer interfaces.\n\n57:23.880 --> 57:27.320\n And they have, I got a chance to see in person\n\n57:27.320 --> 57:30.760\n just a bunch of pigs who had Neuralink chips implanted\n\n57:30.760 --> 57:31.800\n and taken out.\n\n57:31.800 --> 57:34.040\n Those pigs are so happy with life.\n\n57:34.040 --> 57:36.240\n I don't know, I've never seen a happier animal.\n\n57:36.240 --> 57:39.360\n I mean, cause they get to eat,\n\n57:39.360 --> 57:42.520\n cause you were mentioning sort of diets and stuff.\n\n57:42.520 --> 57:45.080\n Pigs seem to love a lot of stuff.\n\n57:45.080 --> 57:47.400\n They're easily made to be happy.\n\n57:47.400 --> 57:51.200\n I don't know if you can comment on your thoughts\n\n57:51.200 --> 57:56.200\n of exploring the capacity of the pig mind\n\n57:59.480 --> 58:01.520\n through some of this testing with Neuralink,\n\n58:01.520 --> 58:02.840\n whether that's exciting to you,\n\n58:02.840 --> 58:04.160\n whether maybe on the humane side,\n\n58:04.160 --> 58:05.560\n it's a little bit concerning,\n\n58:07.480 --> 58:10.180\n if there's something to be said on sort of like,\n\n58:10.180 --> 58:14.380\n yeah, I don't know if it's even the ethical side,\n\n58:14.380 --> 58:16.860\n but just because of your connection to meat\n\n58:16.860 --> 58:21.180\n and to nature and understanding these living beings.\n\n58:21.180 --> 58:22.900\n Well, pigs are incredibly intelligent.\n\n58:22.900 --> 58:24.540\n So I'm not surprised that they're a subject matter\n\n58:24.540 --> 58:25.980\n for Neuralink.\n\n58:25.980 --> 58:26.900\n They're smarter than dogs\n\n58:26.900 --> 58:28.700\n and they're empathetic and emotional.\n\n58:29.660 --> 58:33.060\n And we'll go look at our pigs afterwards and see,\n\n58:33.060 --> 58:36.260\n but they're kind of like joyful and exuberant\n\n58:36.260 --> 58:37.900\n when they're in good health.\n\n58:37.900 --> 58:41.120\n And so that makes sense.\n\n58:41.120 --> 58:43.720\n I'm interested and open.\n\n58:43.720 --> 58:48.720\n I feel that the kind of bleeding edge agriculture movement\n\n58:50.780 --> 58:53.280\n that I'm on the edge of in some ways,\n\n58:53.280 --> 58:54.280\n we're a larger operator,\n\n58:54.280 --> 58:59.260\n but we as a movement have to get into the game.\n\n58:59.260 --> 59:01.940\n We have to move forward in a way that allows us to scale\n\n59:01.940 --> 59:03.740\n if we wanna be viable.\n\n59:03.740 --> 59:06.740\n So I think there has to be openness to how that can happen.\n\n59:06.740 --> 59:09.500\n And I also think there needs to be more thoughtful\n\n59:09.500 --> 59:13.820\n and noisy data about how regenerative ranching\n\n59:13.820 --> 59:15.460\n can sequester carbon.\n\n59:15.460 --> 59:18.700\n I mean, thousands of American ranches\n\n59:18.700 --> 59:20.740\n are selling carbon credits right now.\n\n59:20.740 --> 59:21.860\n The data is that valid.\n\n59:21.860 --> 59:24.620\n And they're not selling carbon credits from like grassland\n\n59:24.620 --> 59:26.340\n that just got a fence around it.\n\n59:26.340 --> 59:28.140\n They're selling carbon credits for verified data\n\n59:28.140 --> 59:31.460\n from animals assisting in carbon sequestration, right?\n\n59:31.460 --> 59:35.620\n So there's got to be a way to get the tech community involved\n\n59:35.620 --> 59:38.460\n in ways to help regenerative agriculture scale.\n\n59:38.460 --> 59:39.780\n In different creative ways.\n\n59:39.780 --> 59:41.220\n And actually, that'd be interesting\n\n59:41.220 --> 59:43.220\n if like Neuralink somehow has,\n\n59:43.220 --> 59:45.180\n and especially because Elon Musk is involved\n\n59:45.180 --> 59:48.880\n and Kimball Musk has his whole effort and appreciation\n\n59:48.880 --> 59:51.080\n of regenerative agriculture\n\n59:51.080 --> 59:54.940\n that I wonder if Neuralink has a role to play,\n\n59:54.940 --> 59:59.720\n like exploring the neurobiology of the animal,\n\n59:59.720 --> 1:00:01.620\n if that somehow will create innovations\n\n1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:06.620\n that lead to improved scaling of regenerative agriculture.\n\n1:00:08.340 --> 1:00:09.180\n That'd be interesting.\n\n1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:10.200\n But you're saying you should be open\n\n1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:11.040\n to all those possibilities.\n\n1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.900\n I don't think, I don't know the landscape to know what.\n\n1:00:13.900 --> 1:00:16.060\n But my sense is that it's very hard.\n\n1:00:17.020 --> 1:00:17.840\n It's very hard.\n\n1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:19.940\n And our farming operation to scale,\n\n1:00:19.940 --> 1:00:22.240\n it's been incredibly complex and challenging.\n\n1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:24.380\n We now work with partner farms.\n\n1:00:24.380 --> 1:00:27.180\n I see their operations, they're incredibly complex.\n\n1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:28.920\n You know, it just seems like there's got to be a way\n\n1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:31.860\n to make some of these things simpler and easier\n\n1:00:31.860 --> 1:00:32.860\n to share information.\n\n1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:33.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:36.060\n I don't know what that answer is.\n\n1:00:36.060 --> 1:00:37.220\n You know what would be cool\n\n1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:39.720\n is if we can understand deeper ways\n\n1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:42.900\n to measure the happiness of an animal.\n\n1:00:42.900 --> 1:00:44.500\n Because then we can optimize,\n\n1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:47.180\n like certified humane could be literally\n\n1:00:47.180 --> 1:00:48.180\n an optimization problem.\n\n1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:51.500\n Just make sure, as opposed to kind of using our,\n\n1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:53.560\n projecting our own human values,\n\n1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.140\n actually measuring what the animal is happy doing.\n\n1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:58.720\n That could be, so understanding the pig brain\n\n1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:00.860\n might help us understand pig happiness\n\n1:01:00.860 --> 1:01:04.540\n and reframe what it means for a happy animal.\n\n1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:07.100\n And then maybe it's a lot easier to make a happy animal,\n\n1:01:07.100 --> 1:01:09.860\n to make the animal happy than we think.\n\n1:01:09.860 --> 1:01:12.140\n And it might have to do with a variety of delicious food\n\n1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:13.700\n in the case of the pig.\n\n1:01:13.700 --> 1:01:16.380\n Is there something you could say about grass fed meat?\n\n1:01:16.380 --> 1:01:18.940\n Is it all, just out of my own sort of curiosity,\n\n1:01:18.940 --> 1:01:21.620\n whenever people say sort of grass fed meat\n\n1:01:21.620 --> 1:01:22.460\n is better for you,\n\n1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:24.940\n are all grass fed meat made the same?\n\n1:01:24.940 --> 1:01:26.180\n Is there different like,\n\n1:01:26.180 --> 1:01:29.400\n it's like the word organic.\n\n1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:31.640\n Is there a lot of variety within that?\n\n1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:32.800\n Like the way Belcampo does it,\n\n1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:34.160\n will the others do it?\n\n1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:38.360\n Just more color if you could add to this whole word\n\n1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:39.200\n and what it means.\n\n1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:43.160\n Grass fed beef has been on grass its entire life.\n\n1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:45.340\n And you wanna look for the words 100% grass fed\n\n1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:47.320\n or grass fed and finished.\n\n1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:52.320\n Now, the challenge with feeding beef grass its whole life\n\n1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:55.560\n is that it gains weight more slowly.\n\n1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.240\n Although beef didn't evolve,\n\n1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:02.560\n eating corn and things, it can eat them.\n\n1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:05.920\n And in eating them, it gains weight more rapidly\n\n1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:10.680\n and has like a version of like an inflammatory response.\n\n1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.000\n If you actually look inside the rumen of the animal\n\n1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:14.840\n inside the stomach,\n\n1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:18.040\n it's like black and shiny inside compared to grass fed\n\n1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:20.240\n animals like greens, smells like compost.\n\n1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:22.480\n So the animals themselves, their whole physiology\n\n1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:24.560\n is damaged by that food,\n\n1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:26.480\n but they also gain weight really quickly\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:27.680\n and they put on a lot of fats.\n\n1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.400\n Like if you or me were to eat a bunch of processed food\n\n1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:32.120\n compared to eating a bunch of greens,\n\n1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.720\n it's the same impact, you're gonna blow up.\n\n1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:37.080\n So the problem for grass fed\n\n1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:39.880\n is getting the animals to gain weight.\n\n1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:41.560\n They're getting a ton of exercise,\n\n1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:43.440\n they're eating really clean, right?\n\n1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:45.320\n And they're super chill.\n\n1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:49.240\n So that's different from the animals that are kept still\n\n1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:52.200\n eating really nutrient dense foods\n\n1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:55.640\n and under a ton of stress, which is a confinement animal.\n\n1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:59.280\n So are all grass fed meats created the same?\n\n1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.640\n The diet, yeah, nutritional profile broadly,\n\n1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.560\n but the length of time that the animal lives\n\n1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:08.760\n is extremely important for the flavor of the meat.\n\n1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:14.560\n We're taking our beef to 24 to 26 months,\n\n1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:16.560\n conventional is around 18 months.\n\n1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.360\n So I'm always looking,\n\n1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:20.080\n and if you're evaluating grass fed animals,\n\n1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:22.360\n you wanna get animals that are typically\n\n1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:23.640\n allowed to live for longer\n\n1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:24.960\n because their flavor is gonna be better,\n\n1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.600\n there's gonna be a bit more fat\n\n1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:31.600\n and their omega ratios also vary very differently.\n\n1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.040\n And I've seen omega ratios,\n\n1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:37.480\n in our firm everywhere from one to three to one to one,\n\n1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:39.800\n ideal is one to one game is typically one to one\n\n1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:42.000\n or one to two omega three to sixes.\n\n1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.800\n But in operations where you don't have year round grass,\n\n1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:46.720\n it's more complicated, you know, you're feeding hay\n\n1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.720\n and you don't get that three to six ratio.\n\n1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:51.640\n Omega threes come from green grass,\n\n1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:53.720\n they're the fat in greens.\n\n1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:56.760\n And so they're scarce and costly, right?\n\n1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:59.320\n So you can have grass fed and finished animals\n\n1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:00.480\n that don't have that perfect ratio\n\n1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:02.800\n because maybe they're in a climate or for whatever reasons,\n\n1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:05.560\n we've had to do it too, during the droughts do hay finishing,\n\n1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.560\n it's not optimal, it changes the ratio a bit.\n\n1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:10.160\n So there's a little bit of variance within it.\n\n1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:14.000\n I'd say though, the variance is a little bit higher\n\n1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:18.480\n the variance within grass fed is still small\n\n1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:20.480\n compared to the variance between conventional\n\n1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:21.880\n and grass fed, right?\n\n1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:24.520\n So there's definitely things to look for within it,\n\n1:04:24.520 --> 1:04:27.800\n but the real difference is between those two.\n\n1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:32.800\n Also thing to notice is that it's not a verified word, okay?\n\n1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:37.320\n So grass fed means animals that have been on grass\n\n1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:38.720\n at some point in their life.\n\n1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:43.920\n The way the cattle industry is in the US,\n\n1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:46.280\n there's segmentation.\n\n1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:49.080\n So there's cow calf operations,\n\n1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:52.080\n then those calves get sold to stocker operations\n\n1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:54.320\n which raised animals in their teens basically,\n\n1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:56.720\n and then those get sold to feed lots.\n\n1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:58.800\n And so those three phases,\n\n1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:02.480\n that first phase of the cow calf is always on grass.\n\n1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:04.680\n It's mother cows and mom cows are amazing.\n\n1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:06.560\n They can thrive on anything\n\n1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:08.440\n and still put all their nutrients into their baby\n\n1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:09.720\n and their babies will be healthy.\n\n1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.120\n So you never are putting mother cows\n\n1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:12.760\n on really premium pasture.\n\n1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:15.160\n So it's usually just kind of like okay pasture,\n\n1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:17.080\n dirty lot, if you ever see kind of like,\n\n1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.320\n scrubly lots with lots of cows and calves on,\n\n1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:20.720\n that's a cow calf operation.\n\n1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:24.000\n So there's also a loophole, unfortunately,\n\n1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.280\n where people use the term grass fed,\n\n1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:27.680\n and they're actually referring to animals\n\n1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:29.180\n that at some point in their life had grass,\n\n1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:31.480\n but that might be pretty far in the rear view mirror.\n\n1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:34.720\n So you need to look at that grass fed and finished\n\n1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.640\n or grass fed 100%.\n\n1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:38.440\n That ratio of omega three to sixes,\n\n1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:41.080\n it changes in like a week on grain.\n\n1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:42.120\n So it's radically different.\n\n1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:43.920\n Unfortunately, it's the same thing for you and me.\n\n1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:45.280\n You can eat clean for a month,\n\n1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:48.000\n you eat junk for three days, you're garbage, right?\n\n1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.160\n It's not like you can just like coast on that, right?\n\n1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:51.000\n We know what that's like.\n\n1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.720\n Same thing for animals, our physiology changes.\n\n1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:55.200\n Food's the number one way we interact with our environment.\n\n1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.160\n And our body changes really rapidly and dramatically.\n\n1:05:58.160 --> 1:06:01.480\n So we know Belcampo and just the way\n\n1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:04.520\n sort of this regenerative farming approach of Belcampo\n\n1:06:04.520 --> 1:06:07.560\n and the sort of high humane is good for the land,\n\n1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:09.780\n is good for the animal.\n\n1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:12.600\n Can you comment on ways it's good for the human\n\n1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.200\n that eats the meat?\n\n1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:16.680\n Is this meat better for you?\n\n1:06:16.680 --> 1:06:21.360\n Yes, and this is where they kind of focus on the joy\n\n1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:23.420\n and animals doing yoga and all this sort of like\n\n1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:27.780\n cynical stuff about this type of agriculture.\n\n1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:30.280\n So just like set that aside,\n\n1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.760\n it really is better for your health.\n\n1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:35.680\n It's got a better fat ratio, it's less inflammatory,\n\n1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:39.440\n it's got higher protein, it's just better product.\n\n1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:43.000\n In the case of beef, it's lower in fat\n\n1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.400\n and that fat has a better quality and it's higher\n\n1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.260\n in poultry and pork, it's also higher in protein.\n\n1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:49.000\n So all the nutritionals are better.\n\n1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.480\n It's got higher density of vitamins,\n\n1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:52.280\n it's got higher density of minerals.\n\n1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:55.360\n And none of this stuff is radically different than,\n\n1:06:55.360 --> 1:06:59.200\n it's not like the product is black and white,\n\n1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:02.640\n but every metric meaningfully is better\n\n1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:05.000\n in the right direction across the board.\n\n1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.840\n So why wouldn't you?\n\n1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:10.920\n I hesitate to take anecdotal evidence\n\n1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:13.000\n as like final scientific conclusions,\n\n1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.140\n but it does seem I've eaten quite a bit\n\n1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:16.600\n of belcampo meat, for example,\n\n1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:19.580\n and it's just my body seems to respond,\n\n1:07:19.580 --> 1:07:21.640\n like it's less bothered by it.\n\n1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:25.800\n Meaning like less inflamed, I just feel better.\n\n1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:28.260\n Because I mostly eat a meat diet\n\n1:07:28.260 --> 1:07:30.840\n and it does seem to be a little bit of a difference\n\n1:07:30.840 --> 1:07:34.040\n what kind of meat I eat, where it comes from.\n\n1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:37.260\n I don't know if that's my own psychology also.\n\n1:07:37.260 --> 1:07:39.180\n I mean, there is an aspect to like,\n\n1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:42.060\n when you know that the meat came from a good place\n\n1:07:42.060 --> 1:07:45.120\n and all the ways we've defined good,\n\n1:07:45.120 --> 1:07:46.880\n you feel better about it.\n\n1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:49.480\n And that has an effect, like decreased stress.\n\n1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:50.840\n So I'm a huge believer in that,\n\n1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:53.240\n like outside of just nutrition,\n\n1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.740\n how you feel about the whole experience is a huge impact.\n\n1:07:55.740 --> 1:07:58.720\n But it does feel like the meat itself\n\n1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.320\n is actually just leading to less inflammation for me\n\n1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:04.920\n or like less, like the bloated feeling\n\n1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:07.560\n and all those negative effects that could come with meat\n\n1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.480\n versus like certain other ground beef that I eat,\n\n1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:15.340\n like store bought chicken breast or steak,\n\n1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:16.440\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:19.220\n My body's a little bit more,\n\n1:08:19.220 --> 1:08:21.140\n works a little bit harder to process that food,\n\n1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:21.980\n it feels like.\n\n1:08:21.980 --> 1:08:23.040\n I don't know if there's science to that,\n\n1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:25.360\n but sort of anecdotally, that seems to be the case.\n\n1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:26.920\n Omega sixes are a big part of that,\n\n1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:27.760\n for in the case of the beef.\n\n1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.840\n You eat a lot of beef, you love beef.\n\n1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:33.000\n And so in a conventional beef product,\n\n1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:36.680\n it's a one to 30 ratio of omega threes to sixes.\n\n1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:39.440\n And sometimes one to 20, one to 30,\n\n1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:41.400\n but that's the wrong direction.\n\n1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:45.320\n In our beef, it's as low as one to one.\n\n1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:48.700\n So that and the omega sixes are what's part of inflammation.\n\n1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:52.460\n Now, the magic in animals\n\n1:08:52.460 --> 1:08:55.000\n is that they're incredibly efficient processors.\n\n1:08:55.000 --> 1:09:00.000\n And in the same way that the body can process\n\n1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:04.160\n and take out tons of things that are toxic\n\n1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:05.000\n out of the environment,\n\n1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.640\n I mean, animals bodies can do that too.\n\n1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:09.880\n So the beauty of meat is that it can be pretty clean.\n\n1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:12.600\n Things like Roundup and stuff don't end up in the meat.\n\n1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:14.800\n When we have antibiotics in our meat,\n\n1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:16.840\n we're not worried about getting like tetracycline\n\n1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:18.420\n from the chicken breast.\n\n1:09:18.420 --> 1:09:19.400\n What we're worried about\n\n1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:21.600\n is the workers getting tetracycline,\n\n1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:23.280\n the chicken growing faster than it should,\n\n1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:26.320\n the meat being chewier and not as high quality.\n\n1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.120\n But the actual antibiotics don't,\n\n1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:30.280\n the animals great at filtering that, right?\n\n1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:31.120\n They get that out.\n\n1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:34.720\n So you have to think about meat not as like contamination\n\n1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:36.320\n of like, oh, there's gonna be some of that garbage\n\n1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:39.600\n they used in the farming in my meat,\n\n1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:41.080\n but it's the more subtle things.\n\n1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.720\n It's the fat ratio, it's the protein density.\n\n1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:48.440\n And there's also just, I think in my experience,\n\n1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:50.580\n there's just more complex flavor\n\n1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:52.520\n and things that taste more complex.\n\n1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.840\n This is, science backs this up, they fill you up faster.\n\n1:09:56.840 --> 1:09:59.000\n So if you're looking to limit,\n\n1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.400\n to eat for fullness and, but not eat as many calories,\n\n1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:06.380\n more complex foods are the way to do that.\n\n1:10:06.380 --> 1:10:08.920\n And that hit, you hit your satiety,\n\n1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:10.140\n help you hit that satiety.\n\n1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.600\n So things like, I mean, all the key amino acids\n\n1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:16.440\n that help you feel full, mostly from meat, right?\n\n1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:17.800\n So those are, that's part of it, like it,\n\n1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.080\n but all meats have those.\n\n1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:20.800\n Then there's other kind of micronutrients\n\n1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:21.960\n and things around that complex flavor\n\n1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:23.440\n that help you feel full faster.\n\n1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.520\n Forgive me for this question,\n\n1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.120\n but it is kind of an interesting one\n\n1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:30.020\n that people are curious about.\n\n1:10:30.020 --> 1:10:33.680\n What does it feel like to be a,\n\n1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:38.120\n or what does it take to be a woman CEO of a meat company?\n\n1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:39.960\n I mean, you're no longer CEO of Belcampo,\n\n1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:42.800\n but you did, you ran, you cofounded Belcampo,\n\n1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:44.440\n you ran it for many, many years.\n\n1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:47.700\n Is there something that you could say\n\n1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.220\n in terms of challenges associated with that?\n\n1:10:51.220 --> 1:10:54.320\n And how did you personally overcome it?\n\n1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:58.280\n So to be a female running a meat and livestock operation,\n\n1:10:59.480 --> 1:11:04.480\n it felt very alone, a lot, you know, for a long time.\n\n1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:09.960\n I felt very, like everybody waiting for me to fail\n\n1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:14.520\n or watching and assuming that I was like,\n\n1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:17.240\n just good at marketing or whatever else.\n\n1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:22.240\n And so it's taken me a while to not internalize that.\n\n1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:31.200\n I think the only reason I'm here\n\n1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:34.920\n is we have our own supply chain in Slaughterhouse.\n\n1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.320\n And I think had I really been playing\n\n1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:37.320\n in the broader meat industry,\n\n1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:38.780\n it would have been a shorter journey.\n\n1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:40.040\n You know, it would have been very hard\n\n1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:42.440\n to make it even get to this phase.\n\n1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:47.440\n But I do, you know, I think the mission is my life's work.\n\n1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:59.560\n The mission of cleaner ingredients that tastes so amazing.\n\n1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:02.400\n You don't need to do too much to them.\n\n1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:04.720\n You know, I like creating food\n\n1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.800\n that's in support of good health.\n\n1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.080\n And then secondary to that, it's the environment,\n\n1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:13.600\n but I want healthy food to be a joy to eat, right?\n\n1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:18.600\n And that's, you know, creating innovation in the space\n\n1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:23.980\n for this company has been about building a brand\n\n1:12:23.980 --> 1:12:26.240\n that people understand and is transparent\n\n1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:28.560\n and that people believe in in an industry\n\n1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:30.800\n that's broadly perceived of as pretty corrupt.\n\n1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:33.560\n So those are things I feel enormously proud of.\n\n1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:37.280\n So you focused on the mission and the pushback,\n\n1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:40.920\n all the mess of the industry.\n\n1:12:40.920 --> 1:12:42.120\n You try not to internalize it,\n\n1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.200\n trying not to let it affect you and focus on the mission.\n\n1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:46.220\n You know, and it's in the joy of it\n\n1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:49.280\n and the part where it's gotten fun for me\n\n1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:51.760\n has been returning to what I love about it.\n\n1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:53.100\n And I've only had the privilege\n\n1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:54.880\n of doing that pretty recently.\n\n1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:58.880\n So I think for me personally, you know, starting,\n\n1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:01.880\n I host these events on the farm called Meat Camps,\n\n1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:03.720\n where I cook and teach people to cook\n\n1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:06.400\n and, you know, taste and talk about flavor\n\n1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:10.320\n and all the like sensual aspects of it that are my fire.\n\n1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.080\n Like, thank goodness I did that stuff\n\n1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:14.400\n because otherwise it was just such a beating.\n\n1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:15.440\n You know, so there were parts of it\n\n1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:17.200\n where I got to feed my fire.\n\n1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:19.600\n And then now in the, you know, the past year,\n\n1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:22.200\n since resigning, I've been, I do all the recipe development.\n\n1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:23.600\n I shoot all the content.\n\n1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:25.020\n I, you know, taste product.\n\n1:13:25.020 --> 1:13:26.840\n I'm developing all of our new products.\n\n1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:27.840\n I launched our meatballs.\n\n1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:29.660\n I'm just about to launch our chicken meatballs,\n\n1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:31.480\n doing a high protein bone broth.\n\n1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:34.160\n Like those are, that's why I did this\n\n1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:36.680\n was to be able to build this great product\n\n1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:37.960\n that I could build on.\n\n1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:40.160\n So I'm kind of at that place now,\n\n1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:41.360\n but it's taken a lot longer.\n\n1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:43.960\n And I think, you know, looking at the landscape\n\n1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:47.060\n of what to do in food, this is definitely,\n\n1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.940\n we tackled the most complicated problem.\n\n1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:55.660\n That I can imagine, you know, I did it like\n\n1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:57.640\n in the most old fashioned way, right?\n\n1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:59.520\n So it's been super complex.\n\n1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:00.880\n And then I also look at it and I'm like, yeah,\n\n1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:03.720\n and it's been messy and it's gonna continue to be hard,\n\n1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:07.080\n but I'm proud of having tackled the hard problems.\n\n1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:08.560\n So the hard problem here is not\n\n1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:10.560\n in the space of technologies.\n\n1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:13.680\n It's in the space of bringing something\n\n1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:17.400\n that we've done for a long, long time in our human history\n\n1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:21.160\n and scaling it in the face\n\n1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.160\n of all the other economic pressures.\n\n1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:25.980\n Like doing so successfully,\n\n1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:27.760\n also communicating to the rest of the world\n\n1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:29.600\n that this is a powerful solution.\n\n1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:32.360\n So inspiring the rest of the world that regenerative farming,\n\n1:14:32.360 --> 1:14:34.960\n like running a company in this kind of way\n\n1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.120\n that's humane for animals, good for the land,\n\n1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:41.100\n good for people, even if it costs,\n\n1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:44.040\n like if there's an increased cost to the meat,\n\n1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:46.120\n even if that, if you have a broader vision\n\n1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:48.920\n that means eating less meat overall,\n\n1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:52.240\n that that is like inspiring the world\n\n1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:53.780\n that this is a future we want.\n\n1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:57.540\n And just taking that on and getting that done.\n\n1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:00.980\n Got a chance to eat a little bit of cheese,\n\n1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:03.680\n which is a good opportunity\n\n1:15:03.680 --> 1:15:06.400\n to talk about your experience in Italy.\n\n1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:08.720\n You spent some time, or as south of Europe,\n\n1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:09.920\n I'm not sure if it was Italy.\n\n1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:11.440\n Yeah, I lived in Italy, but.\n\n1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:14.760\n And there's cheese involved, right?\n\n1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:18.860\n Like what did you take away from that experience,\n\n1:15:18.860 --> 1:15:21.600\n both as a chef and as a human being?\n\n1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:25.540\n I moved to Europe right after my early 20s\n\n1:15:25.540 --> 1:15:27.560\n and I worked as a cheese maker.\n\n1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:32.520\n And I lived in really small rural farms\n\n1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.920\n in the countryside.\n\n1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:39.400\n And I got up early and milked animals, made cheese.\n\n1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.400\n And I got to live in a traditional agricultural society\n\n1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:47.380\n and learn how they ate.\n\n1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.520\n So it shaped me as a cook\n\n1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:55.520\n because it was a chance to have incredible ingredients,\n\n1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:58.000\n learn how to cook very simple food.\n\n1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.640\n I had been immersed in thought\n\n1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:02.760\n that I wanted to be like a chefy chef, right?\n\n1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:04.240\n Because I love food and I love cooking\n\n1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.880\n and I was just drawn to that world.\n\n1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:09.880\n But I don't like the experience\n\n1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:11.440\n of that sort of like fancy food experience\n\n1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:15.400\n is not what is exciting for me about it.\n\n1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:18.960\n So I loved working in that environment\n\n1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:21.880\n because I got to eat lunches and dinners\n\n1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:24.720\n and everything with the farm that I lived in.\n\n1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:26.400\n The farm that I lived on\n\n1:16:26.400 --> 1:16:31.080\n and just very traditional, simple way to eat.\n\n1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:34.760\n The other piece of it is I went to high school in the 90s,\n\n1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:37.720\n child of like the low fat generation, right?\n\n1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:40.500\n And it was just really liberating and amazing\n\n1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:43.920\n to eat tons of super fatty foods\n\n1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:46.680\n and olive oil all over the place\n\n1:16:46.680 --> 1:16:48.800\n and bleak slabs of bread and salami\n\n1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.580\n and being this like vibrant health,\n\n1:16:50.580 --> 1:16:55.320\n like be leaner, you know, happy, no skin stuff,\n\n1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:57.680\n you know, stop getting split ends.\n\n1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:59.360\n Like I stopped having flaky nails,\n\n1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:02.220\n like just stuff that had bothered me my whole life,\n\n1:17:02.220 --> 1:17:04.400\n including like just moodiness.\n\n1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:05.960\n And that all just changed.\n\n1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:08.520\n And granted, I was also like living on a farm in Italy\n\n1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:10.500\n and getting up with the sunlight.\n\n1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:14.440\n And like there were lots of great aspects of my life as well\n\n1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:15.600\n that happened in that time.\n\n1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:18.280\n But I was just immersed in this diet\n\n1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:20.520\n that I realized like, man, this is so simple.\n\n1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:23.600\n And I also loved that I had like, you know,\n\n1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:26.520\n you'd have dinner and it was just like some ricotta cheese\n\n1:17:26.520 --> 1:17:27.880\n with some olive oil, some bread\n\n1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:30.960\n and like a bowl of fava beans.\n\n1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:32.400\n It's like, that's dinner.\n\n1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.640\n And it kind of broke down my assumptions too\n\n1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:37.200\n about like dinner always has to be this, you know,\n\n1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:38.880\n a protein and a vegetable and, you know,\n\n1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:43.400\n being more fluid and more seasonal was exciting for me.\n\n1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:46.840\n So I just learned kind of a lot about paying attention\n\n1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:49.640\n to food, simple preparation\n\n1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:54.640\n and the vibrancy of health that I personally experienced\n\n1:17:54.980 --> 1:17:56.720\n kind of made me double down on that.\n\n1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.360\n Our mutual friend, Andrew Huberman,\n\n1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:02.880\n mentioned something offline to me\n\n1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:06.020\n about something involving the mob.\n\n1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:06.860\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:09.040\n Is there something you could share or is this,\n\n1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:11.960\n or are people going to hurt if you share this?\n\n1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:13.600\n It's far enough in the rear view mirror.\n\n1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:18.600\n I mean, I was hired by this group in Sicily on,\n\n1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:23.600\n and this is, you know, I was all of like 21 years old\n\n1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:26.040\n and to get a permit to work there,\n\n1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:28.000\n you have to show that you have a competency\n\n1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.060\n that nobody else in Italy has.\n\n1:18:30.060 --> 1:18:32.520\n And that competency for Anya Fernald at the time\n\n1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:33.840\n was cheese expert.\n\n1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:36.840\n So it was like, stupid American girl being like,\n\n1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:37.840\n going to the consulate.\n\n1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:38.920\n So I already knew that it was like,\n\n1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:41.020\n there was something wobbly about this organization,\n\n1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:42.720\n but I wanted to work for them.\n\n1:18:42.720 --> 1:18:47.720\n And my boss from that time did end up in federal prison\n\n1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:52.720\n for corruption many years later, embezzlement primarily.\n\n1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:56.000\n But, so I was definitely in an environment\n\n1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.320\n that was answering to multiple masters.\n\n1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:01.580\n That's a nice way to put it.\n\n1:19:01.580 --> 1:19:04.680\n It was, I couldn't have asked for a better way\n\n1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:07.840\n to kind of get with life and understand\n\n1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:09.800\n how things happen in the world though.\n\n1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:13.800\n You know, of learning as somebody who tends\n\n1:19:13.800 --> 1:19:17.560\n to be super direct and not very subtle,\n\n1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:19.120\n it was amazing to be in this world\n\n1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:22.120\n where like everybody communicates in multiple levels.\n\n1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:24.900\n Like we're going to lunch with my boss,\n\n1:19:24.900 --> 1:19:26.560\n with somebody we're gonna do a business deal with\n\n1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:30.440\n and by the, they ordered a glass of wine\n\n1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:35.120\n and with that order communicated like, disappointment.\n\n1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:36.720\n Because that, the father of the person\n\n1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:39.800\n who had made that wine had offended that other guys.\n\n1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:42.360\n I like that level of stuff, like nothing happened directly.\n\n1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:43.440\n I'm like, what are we talking about afterwards?\n\n1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:44.380\n I'm like, what happened that lunch?\n\n1:19:44.380 --> 1:19:45.620\n It's like, oh, I just, you know,\n\n1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:47.760\n I told him this by ordering that, whatever.\n\n1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:48.600\n You know, that kind of thing.\n\n1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:52.160\n So understand that there's different ways of communicating.\n\n1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:56.880\n But it was also, you know, it was interesting to see.\n\n1:19:56.880 --> 1:19:58.680\n And I think I, you know, it's kind of the struggle\n\n1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.040\n that I've lived again and again in my life.\n\n1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:03.600\n Fundamentally, what we were doing in that operation\n\n1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:05.920\n was there's a very traditional cheese\n\n1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:08.720\n called the Raguzano cheese in Southeastern Sicily\n\n1:20:08.720 --> 1:20:09.720\n where I lived, Ragusa.\n\n1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:12.080\n And it was about scaling that operation.\n\n1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:14.280\n So it was European Union money\n\n1:20:14.280 --> 1:20:16.360\n that my boss was also unfortunately using for other things.\n\n1:20:16.360 --> 1:20:19.720\n But fundamentally it was to take that,\n\n1:20:19.720 --> 1:20:21.520\n this type of very small scale cheese,\n\n1:20:21.520 --> 1:20:22.840\n get them exported, help them scale.\n\n1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:23.680\n And we did it.\n\n1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:24.760\n And it was really challenging.\n\n1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:27.160\n And I learned a lot about the safety issues\n\n1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:28.960\n and collaboration issues\n\n1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:31.240\n and creating groups of farmers for scale.\n\n1:20:31.240 --> 1:20:34.720\n So it's kind of been doing the same thing again and again.\n\n1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:37.640\n But Sicily, it, you know,\n\n1:20:37.640 --> 1:20:39.260\n it was also just the first place\n\n1:20:39.260 --> 1:20:44.260\n where I would regularly forage for food.\n\n1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:45.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:48.360\n You know, like there I'd go to friends houses\n\n1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:50.480\n and we'd like go out and pick nettles\n\n1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:52.080\n or go out and pick wild asparagus.\n\n1:20:52.080 --> 1:20:54.160\n So every season there were stuff that you'd be gathering.\n\n1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.920\n And that was just part of how you lived.\n\n1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:57.520\n And it was part of your health.\n\n1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:00.380\n So that was, I just learned a ton in that time\n\n1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:05.380\n about like simple eating and really that healthy food,\n\n1:21:05.380 --> 1:21:08.380\n the simpler it is, the better, right?\n\n1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:10.280\n Like this sort of sense that healthy food\n\n1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:12.040\n isn't in a tiny package, granola bar,\n\n1:21:12.040 --> 1:21:13.360\n lots of labels, lots of powders.\n\n1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:14.760\n It's like the more simple, essential,\n\n1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:17.120\n closer to the land can actually lead to optimal health.\n\n1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:19.520\n You've learned to appreciate the simplicity of food,\n\n1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:22.920\n the beauty within the simplicity.\n\n1:21:22.920 --> 1:21:23.760\n I think it's because it was the first time\n\n1:21:23.760 --> 1:21:28.280\n that I had amazing food quality.\n\n1:21:28.280 --> 1:21:29.120\n Okay.\n\n1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:31.200\n Cause in the, where I grew up,\n\n1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:32.800\n there wasn't that food quality.\n\n1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:36.960\n Like I had some stuff from my garden and things\n\n1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:38.600\n that were great, but that's the kind of place\n\n1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:39.800\n where when artichokes in season,\n\n1:21:39.800 --> 1:21:42.700\n all of a sudden there's guys selling artichokes\n\n1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:44.520\n on their bicycles in the street\n\n1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:47.000\n and they're just fresh picked and you'd get that one thing\n\n1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.760\n or the torpedo onions or they like,\n\n1:21:48.760 --> 1:21:50.680\n so there's a seasonality and celebration of things\n\n1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:51.860\n in their peak moment.\n\n1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:53.920\n And you would just have that one thing.\n\n1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:56.800\n And that was the first time I'd ever eaten in that way.\n\n1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:00.400\n You were a judge several times on Iron Chef.\n\n1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:05.080\n How do you judge a good meal, like what your own,\n\n1:22:05.080 --> 1:22:09.920\n other people's, like what rating system is good?\n\n1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:11.800\n I mean, I go on experience and think about how many\n\n1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:13.920\n of your like most memorable, fantastic meals\n\n1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:16.280\n are like three star Michelin meals.\n\n1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:17.960\n It's more about the experience, right?\n\n1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:20.620\n It's more about that slow down, who are you with?\n\n1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:23.680\n And some of our best meals are like the most simple things.\n\n1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:27.140\n So Iron Chef, those were fun experiences.\n\n1:22:28.080 --> 1:22:29.600\n It's a lot of sous vide though.\n\n1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:31.200\n It's a lot of sauces.\n\n1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:32.580\n It's a lot of powders.\n\n1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:34.280\n I mean, it's kind of like magic food.\n\n1:22:34.280 --> 1:22:37.000\n So that's not, I mean, it's incredible\n\n1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.440\n to watch it as science, but I don't know\n\n1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:41.440\n if those are my most memorable meals.\n\n1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:44.160\n So the experience is how you judge a good meal.\n\n1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:45.800\n For you personally, if you were a judge\n\n1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:48.320\n of the entirety of the human experience\n\n1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:50.660\n in terms of the culinary journey,\n\n1:22:50.660 --> 1:22:53.160\n that would be like the people you're eating with,\n\n1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:56.560\n the environment, like how you feel,\n\n1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:59.680\n the journey, the building up to that meal, the whole thing.\n\n1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:00.680\n You can't separate it out.\n\n1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:05.680\n When I was learning as an apprentice cheese maker in Greece,\n\n1:23:06.800 --> 1:23:08.160\n one of the best meals of my life\n\n1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:10.840\n is like a bowl of cold sheep milk yogurt\n\n1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:13.080\n with like a crust of cold fat on top.\n\n1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:15.000\n So like the way that these fatty,\n\n1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.240\n sheep milk can have double the percentage\n\n1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.440\n of fat than cow milk.\n\n1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:20.400\n So like there's the yogurt and then there's this crust\n\n1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:23.540\n of fat and then they pour the fresh honey over the top\n\n1:23:23.540 --> 1:23:27.680\n and you just eat like this bowl of probably top five meals\n\n1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:29.460\n of my life, right?\n\n1:23:29.460 --> 1:23:31.920\n I mean, that's the simplicity, it's just the best thing.\n\n1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:33.520\n And it was the fact that it's in Terracotta\n\n1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:34.840\n and I'd had this amazing day\n\n1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.780\n and all of these things come together,\n\n1:23:36.780 --> 1:23:38.000\n but I still remember that feeling.\n\n1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.780\n And I think most of us have those like really great\n\n1:23:40.780 --> 1:23:45.480\n sensual memories of food and they're not about necessarily\n\n1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:49.440\n that one fancy over the top restaurant or something.\n\n1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:52.680\n It's really about the cold context of enjoyment.\n\n1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:54.480\n Maybe you can help me with something.\n\n1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.440\n So I think Offline said that we're both introverts a bit,\n\n1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:03.440\n but I certainly find joy in repetition.\n\n1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:07.080\n So I kind of hide away as an introvert\n\n1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:09.840\n and eat the same thing over and over and over again.\n\n1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:11.920\n But at the same time, I had this conversation\n\n1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:14.160\n with Tyler Cohen, who's an economist,\n\n1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:15.960\n but he's also a food critic.\n\n1:24:15.960 --> 1:24:19.580\n He writes these incredible posts about different foods.\n\n1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:23.520\n And we had this conversation about\n\n1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:24.920\n what his last meal would be.\n\n1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:26.840\n If he had to choose, like what is the best meal\n\n1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:29.740\n he's ever eaten that he would want to eat?\n\n1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:31.160\n And he had a good answer about it.\n\n1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:33.000\n It had to do with experience, I think.\n\n1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.380\n For him, it was a particular Mexican restaurant\n\n1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:37.680\n and it had in Mexico because of the ingredients,\n\n1:24:37.680 --> 1:24:40.000\n because of the experience, because of the work it took\n\n1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.120\n to get there and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:44.720\n But it also made me realize, like when I was going home\n\n1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:47.800\n after that conversation, that I couldn't answer\n\n1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:50.560\n that question myself, like what is the best meal\n\n1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:51.600\n I've ever eaten?\n\n1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:54.680\n Because I really haven't experienced much.\n\n1:24:54.680 --> 1:24:58.020\n And so it almost was like a challenge to myself.\n\n1:24:58.020 --> 1:25:00.920\n Like I feel like I should journey out a little bit more\n\n1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:03.680\n in this life and try stuff.\n\n1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:07.780\n And to try to see like what is the best meal\n\n1:25:07.780 --> 1:25:09.820\n for me in the world?\n\n1:25:09.820 --> 1:25:13.440\n You know, like both the experience and the taste, right?\n\n1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:16.100\n So I was kind of wondering, first I'd love to ask you\n\n1:25:16.100 --> 1:25:18.140\n like what your last meal would be\n\n1:25:18.140 --> 1:25:20.880\n or what is the greatest meal you've ever eaten?\n\n1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.400\n But also, and you're still very young,\n\n1:25:23.400 --> 1:25:26.960\n and so there's still more experiences to be had, right?\n\n1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:31.480\n And for me, like how do you go about finding\n\n1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:32.880\n the best meal in the world?\n\n1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:38.460\n Is there a device you could give essentially?\n\n1:25:38.460 --> 1:25:42.320\n There's that sense of anticipation, right?\n\n1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:46.920\n So if it's the best meal, I'd say for you,\n\n1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:49.700\n it would need to be on the heels of something\n\n1:25:49.700 --> 1:25:52.240\n where you'd pushed yourself with a fast\n\n1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:54.040\n or with an athletic event, right?\n\n1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:56.460\n Or something like you would be coming into it\n\n1:25:56.460 --> 1:25:59.200\n with a sense of anticipation because of deprivation.\n\n1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.560\n You'd be hungry for it in a bigger sense of the word,\n\n1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:04.140\n like hungry for deep nutrition on your soul level\n\n1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:05.460\n as well as your belly.\n\n1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:06.880\n So I'd say that you'd have to think about it\n\n1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:09.980\n as a phase of things, like multiple things.\n\n1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:14.240\n And then I also think, you love meat, you love cheese.\n\n1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:16.760\n You have to have some things that come together, right?\n\n1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.160\n Like there's gotta be some specific elements\n\n1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:21.720\n of just your favorite flavors in that.\n\n1:26:21.720 --> 1:26:23.520\n But there could be flavors yet to be discovered.\n\n1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:28.120\n That's a whole other thing because I just emotionally\n\n1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:29.660\n and physically feel good on meat,\n\n1:26:29.660 --> 1:26:34.620\n but that doesn't mean like maybe like a rice based dish,\n\n1:26:34.620 --> 1:26:36.760\n like sushi or something like that,\n\n1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:39.400\n or Indian cuisine where it's like sauces\n\n1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:40.840\n and the breads and whatever.\n\n1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:42.120\n I love that stuff too.\n\n1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:46.460\n So we're not talking about like a meal is an experience\n\n1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:49.640\n that could be like a one night stand,\n\n1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:52.400\n but with a piece of food, right?\n\n1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:53.880\n It could be a totally different\n\n1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:56.040\n than what actually makes you feel good\n\n1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:57.360\n when you eat it every day.\n\n1:26:57.360 --> 1:26:58.520\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.420\n Completely, completely analogous.\n\n1:27:00.420 --> 1:27:01.260\n I get that.\n\n1:27:01.260 --> 1:27:03.160\n I mean, you also though, there's elements of comfort\n\n1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:05.400\n and love and those different pieces for you.\n\n1:27:05.400 --> 1:27:07.720\n But I think you gotta look at like,\n\n1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:09.640\n where would you go somewhere?\n\n1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:13.240\n Like would you go to a place where you could hike in Japan\n\n1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:15.720\n and then end up in a little place where you eat something?\n\n1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:17.160\n That's where I would think you were gonna have\n\n1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:18.600\n that magic moment.\n\n1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:20.120\n Maybe someplace you go to Mongolia\n\n1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:22.500\n and you're in a really extreme environment\n\n1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:23.400\n for three or four days,\n\n1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:25.700\n and then you come back and you're in a farm\n\n1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:27.720\n and you get something on the table that's a surprise\n\n1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:28.560\n and you're hungry.\n\n1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.040\n Like that's gonna be the moment where you're gonna explode\n\n1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:34.940\n in the instance of like the culinary level\n\n1:27:34.940 --> 1:27:36.560\n for Alexa levels up, right?\n\n1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:37.560\n That's the journey for you.\n\n1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:39.960\n But it has to be, I think from understanding you,\n\n1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.600\n like a combination of that pushing yourself anticipation\n\n1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:47.920\n and something about the, exactly, and the environment.\n\n1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:50.240\n Well, I definitely, definitely,\n\n1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:53.400\n like some fasting is part of a great meal for me.\n\n1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:56.640\n So like 24 hours is like the minimum.\n\n1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:01.000\n You're more sensitive to the richness of any experience\n\n1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.800\n for me when I fast 24 hours.\n\n1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.400\n And so that's a requirement.\n\n1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:09.000\n For a good meal is 24 hour fast, I think.\n\n1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:11.640\n It's just like you're able to taste,\n\n1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:13.120\n I don't know, maybe it's psychological,\n\n1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:17.600\n but you're able to disassemble the various flavors\n\n1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:20.320\n in a meal as simple as like even a chicken breast.\n\n1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:22.100\n There's all kinds of flavors going on.\n\n1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:24.280\n Because like when you cook a chicken breast,\n\n1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.900\n there's like the outside, the inside.\n\n1:28:26.900 --> 1:28:29.340\n I mean, the volume of the meat tastes different\n\n1:28:29.340 --> 1:28:31.680\n as you eat like the different fibers.\n\n1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:34.640\n And you can like tell all those differences as you're eating\n\n1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:37.520\n when you're fasting, and you can appreciate that.\n\n1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:38.760\n And of course, you're right,\n\n1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:40.640\n part of the journey is important.\n\n1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:42.880\n It makes me think like whether restaurants\n\n1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.840\n is the right place to explore or what.\n\n1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:47.960\n I'm envisioning it on a farm for you.\n\n1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.280\n And I'm envisioning it in a place\n\n1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:51.920\n that's like really into ag and food.\n\n1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:54.040\n You know, like even a place like Romania.\n\n1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:56.300\n You know, like they have incredible farms, right?\n\n1:28:56.300 --> 1:28:58.840\n Where it's not gonna get any like fancy restaurants there,\n\n1:28:58.840 --> 1:29:02.360\n but you're probably gonna have some amazing little cheeses\n\n1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:04.800\n and cured meats, and you might go to some, you know,\n\n1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:06.400\n have some experience and end up in a place\n\n1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:07.600\n with like four things on the plate\n\n1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:09.120\n and each of them blows your mind.\n\n1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:12.000\n You know, like, or Japan is another place like that.\n\n1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.560\n I think Vietnam, Laos, like, I mean, those are countries\n\n1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:16.600\n where there's like these incredible niche ingredients\n\n1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.960\n and this essentialism around food.\n\n1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:19.800\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:21.800\n Or maybe it's in Russia with Putin.\n\n1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:23.240\n That might be the best meal in the world.\n\n1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:24.080\n With him on the farm.\n\n1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:27.640\n Yeah, that'd be, it's hard to reproduce that.\n\n1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:29.920\n If that is in fact a good meal, it'd be, you know,\n\n1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:32.400\n it's hard to get them out to the farm,\n\n1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:34.760\n but maybe one time they'd be the best meal.\n\n1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:35.720\n What about you?\n\n1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:39.840\n For me, like it's the ingredients that I associate\n\n1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.280\n with like indulgence, like be fresh bread\n\n1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:44.520\n with like my favorite cultured butter on it,\n\n1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:46.360\n be food of my childhood.\n\n1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:47.320\n I grew up in Oregon.\n\n1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:50.440\n We always had salmon and I smoked salmon or salmon eggs,\n\n1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.740\n like really good salmon eggs.\n\n1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:52.580\n I love cheese.\n\n1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:53.420\n I love goat cheese.\n\n1:29:53.420 --> 1:29:54.380\n I love all kinds of cheese.\n\n1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:55.440\n There'd be cheese.\n\n1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:56.560\n I love meat, obviously.\n\n1:29:56.560 --> 1:29:59.040\n I'm imagining it's sort of like an abundance\n\n1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:00.200\n of like 10 things I love.\n\n1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:01.040\n It's not a dish.\n\n1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:02.040\n You know, it's like all the yummy things.\n\n1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:04.840\n All of your indulgences on the same plate, yeah.\n\n1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:07.040\n And there isn't like, for me, there's not like a big cake\n\n1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:08.080\n or something super like that.\n\n1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:10.880\n It's like really yummy things that I love,\n\n1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:13.520\n like really fresh, crusty, delicious bread that's warm\n\n1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:14.760\n and it's got a bunch of butter on it\n\n1:30:14.760 --> 1:30:17.280\n and I can put some salt on it and eat a big slab of that.\n\n1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:19.300\n That's just, that's where I'm at.\n\n1:30:19.300 --> 1:30:20.140\n That's funny.\n\n1:30:20.140 --> 1:30:24.480\n And so meat to you is not like one of those indulgences?\n\n1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:25.320\n Oh, definitely.\n\n1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:26.400\n There'd definitely be steak there too.\n\n1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:28.440\n I'm just imagining not like there isn't a specific dish.\n\n1:30:28.440 --> 1:30:30.440\n It's like eight or 10 things, right?\n\n1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:31.960\n It's the fresh bread.\n\n1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:34.000\n It's something like fishy, yummy,\n\n1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.900\n probably be really good fresh berries too.\n\n1:30:36.900 --> 1:30:38.960\n There'd be a steak or a pork chop\n\n1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:42.480\n or something like meaty and delicious and savory.\n\n1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:43.640\n There'd be some cheese,\n\n1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:46.160\n just a bunch of different things that I love to eat\n\n1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:48.040\n that like all kind of check boxes for me\n\n1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:49.660\n is probably what would make me happiest.\n\n1:30:49.660 --> 1:30:51.680\n I'm afraid of variety.\n\n1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:53.620\n I like the focus when you can just,\n\n1:30:53.620 --> 1:30:54.460\n this is all you have,\n\n1:30:54.460 --> 1:30:57.640\n the scarcity of just this is the one ingredient\n\n1:30:57.640 --> 1:31:01.760\n and really appreciating it or maybe one thing,\n\n1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:05.160\n like one full complex flavor, whatever the heck that is.\n\n1:31:06.040 --> 1:31:08.440\n It's like the distraction,\n\n1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:11.560\n the serial dating nature of having a bunch of things\n\n1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:15.000\n on a plate is, yeah,\n\n1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.860\n for some reason that prevents me\n\n1:31:16.860 --> 1:31:19.280\n from fully enjoying any one of them.\n\n1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:20.800\n I don't know why that is.\n\n1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:23.160\n The more healthy way to do it is the variety.\n\n1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:25.840\n Your way is the healthier way to do it.\n\n1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:27.600\n Is alcohol involved?\n\n1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:29.120\n I don't drink very much.\n\n1:31:29.120 --> 1:31:32.760\n I like red wine, but I just don't really,\n\n1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:35.380\n I love red wine with good food.\n\n1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:41.560\n I also cofounded a rum business that's an organic rum,\n\n1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:42.760\n so I love that product,\n\n1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:44.160\n but that's not, for me,\n\n1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:49.160\n it's like I'm more interested in the food, I'd say.\n\n1:31:49.160 --> 1:31:52.780\n Is there some connection between your chef life,\n\n1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:54.540\n cooking and music?\n\n1:31:54.540 --> 1:31:57.200\n Does this music have a role in the experience?\n\n1:31:57.200 --> 1:31:59.400\n I love artistic expression,\n\n1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:02.120\n and that's always had a role in my life\n\n1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:03.520\n in the same way I love to paint and draw\n\n1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:05.880\n and all the different things.\n\n1:32:05.880 --> 1:32:09.040\n I was a professional musician when I lived in Sicily,\n\n1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:10.600\n by definition, technicality,\n\n1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:12.500\n because I played in the municipal band.\n\n1:32:14.840 --> 1:32:19.400\n So I would march around the town with all the funerals.\n\n1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:22.340\n I get like 50 euro every time I'd march in a funeral\n\n1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:24.280\n playing my oboe, so it's given me,\n\n1:32:24.280 --> 1:32:25.720\n I like that because I like to,\n\n1:32:25.720 --> 1:32:27.000\n like you were talking about going to farms,\n\n1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:30.840\n like what I quested for was experience and connection,\n\n1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:32.680\n in places where I could learn things.\n\n1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:34.720\n That's been the through line of my learning journey.\n\n1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:36.880\n I've learned things and sought knowledge\n\n1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:40.000\n that I can't get in any conventional learning environment,\n\n1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:42.100\n and so what are the tools that let me do that?\n\n1:32:42.100 --> 1:32:45.600\n It was like being adaptable and comfortable\n\n1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:46.440\n in different cultures,\n\n1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:48.400\n but also having common ground points\n\n1:32:48.400 --> 1:32:51.320\n that allow you to connect with people,\n\n1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:52.740\n so music's one of those things.\n\n1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:56.400\n So I love music, but I also,\n\n1:32:56.400 --> 1:32:57.800\n there's any number of enjoy of food,\n\n1:32:57.800 --> 1:33:00.480\n being able to pitch in and help in the kitchen,\n\n1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:01.480\n you know, like cards,\n\n1:33:01.480 --> 1:33:02.640\n like those are when you're dealing with\n\n1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:04.680\n getting into like farming communities and stuff,\n\n1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:06.360\n that stuff really helps, right?\n\n1:33:06.360 --> 1:33:08.380\n So I basically have cultivated tools\n\n1:33:08.380 --> 1:33:11.400\n that let me drop into places where I can learn,\n\n1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:14.160\n and so those are all kind of a piece.\n\n1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:15.920\n Those are just tools to get in there.\n\n1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:19.000\n That said, we did listen to Justin Bieber earlier today.\n\n1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.280\n I need to get more into him.\n\n1:33:20.280 --> 1:33:23.560\n I need to understand the full complexity of the Biebs.\n\n1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:25.560\n You're trying to achieve what hunting stands for,\n\n1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:27.480\n but at a much larger scale,\n\n1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:29.560\n which is what kind of Belcampo stands for,\n\n1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:32.480\n but what are your thoughts on hunting as a source of meat?\n\n1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:35.960\n It's amazing, 100% pro hunting.\n\n1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:39.080\n I think the reason that hunting flips the switch\n\n1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.000\n for so many people is because it's the first thing\n\n1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.920\n they've had clean meat in their lives.\n\n1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:48.720\n Okay, so I think that the hunter's journey,\n\n1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:51.120\n when people get so turned on by hunting,\n\n1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:53.840\n they're just like, oh my God, I'm never going back.\n\n1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:56.240\n I'm saying that's great if you've got access to that,\n\n1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:57.800\n or if you know the guy who'll give you the backstrap,\n\n1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:02.640\n awesome, but that's not achievable for most of us,\n\n1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:04.980\n and I do think that talking to hunters\n\n1:34:04.980 --> 1:34:07.120\n about their experiences, what they love about it,\n\n1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:09.000\n many of them are just outdoors,\n\n1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.080\n and I say that because most of them are men,\n\n1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:11.760\n but most of them love the outdoors aspect of it\n\n1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:14.160\n and being out in the wild,\n\n1:34:14.160 --> 1:34:15.920\n but a lot of them, it's because of how they feel\n\n1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:18.480\n when they eat the meat, and it's because they're eating,\n\n1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:22.120\n I mean, 99% of meat in America is made a very specific way,\n\n1:34:22.120 --> 1:34:25.800\n and it's in a way that is pretty inflammatory,\n\n1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:30.200\n not incredibly delicious, and when you're on that extreme,\n\n1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.240\n and then you toggle to having\n\n1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:34.280\n this totally different style of product,\n\n1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.180\n it feels radically different in your body,\n\n1:34:36.180 --> 1:34:38.420\n so of course you're like, I'll never go back.\n\n1:34:38.420 --> 1:34:40.640\n So when I talk about us being on that spectrum,\n\n1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:42.640\n it's like, well, it's, hunted meat's,\n\n1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:45.760\n I mean, I can never on any commercial operation\n\n1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:49.560\n create the variety of the biodiversity of species\n\n1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:53.120\n that an elk gets when it's wandering around of its own,\n\n1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:55.340\n I mean, there's no way you can do that on a farm,\n\n1:34:55.340 --> 1:34:58.720\n so there's always gonna be that extra five or 10%\n\n1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:00.880\n that those wild animals are gonna have,\n\n1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:02.700\n and those wild animals also fast for longer,\n\n1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:04.360\n so they go through periods of starvation,\n\n1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:07.760\n and that creates an even slower growth for musculature\n\n1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:10.800\n that's gonna create even more unique flavor\n\n1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:14.220\n and characteristics, so that's why there's that extra\n\n1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:18.080\n in the hunted meat, but you can come a lot closer\n\n1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:19.880\n with regenerative traditional farming\n\n1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:21.960\n to that flavor and health\n\n1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:24.000\n than with any other type of farming I know,\n\n1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:25.560\n so that's where I see it on the spectrum.\n\n1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:29.700\n I love that people are getting excited about game,\n\n1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:33.680\n because it's better for your health,\n\n1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:35.920\n it's got all the same characteristics\n\n1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:37.480\n as regenerative farmed meat,\n\n1:35:37.480 --> 1:35:40.240\n and it gets people turned on to simple, delicious food.\n\n1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:44.640\n You know, you shouldn't have to cover food\n\n1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:48.560\n with sauce that's got corn syrup and soy,\n\n1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:51.240\n a bunch of junk in it to make it palatable.\n\n1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:52.560\n If you gotta put sauce on your food,\n\n1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:54.680\n you need to look at your ingredients.\n\n1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:57.000\n You need to revisit what you're starting from,\n\n1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.740\n because if you have to put a bunch of things\n\n1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:02.860\n to mask flavor onto anything you're eating,\n\n1:36:02.860 --> 1:36:04.840\n you're trying to basically fool your palate\n\n1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:07.200\n into doing what's not best for your body.\n\n1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:08.800\n We're trying to tell our palates,\n\n1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:10.120\n like, just make it through this plate\n\n1:36:10.120 --> 1:36:12.020\n so you can get the calories in,\n\n1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:13.320\n and we're masking the fact\n\n1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:15.600\n that we don't actually find it very appetizing.\n\n1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:17.360\n So we're kind of teaching ourselves\n\n1:36:17.360 --> 1:36:20.340\n to overcome our instinct with food.\n\n1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:24.240\n We're saying, here's this kind of bland base substrate,\n\n1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.280\n not very interesting, I'm not like sparking to it.\n\n1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:29.400\n Awesome, put sugar and salt on it.\n\n1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.440\n This up the hyperprocess flavor profile.\n\n1:36:31.440 --> 1:36:32.600\n Great, done.\n\n1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:34.380\n And then you're sparked to it.\n\n1:36:34.380 --> 1:36:35.960\n That's a very short road,\n\n1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:37.560\n and that's, I think, a lot of the health problems\n\n1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:41.200\n we have now is because we're masking flavors\n\n1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:43.080\n and basically trying to get ourselves\n\n1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:44.600\n to move down this path of the same way\n\n1:36:44.600 --> 1:36:46.880\n we behave around all hyperprocess foods.\n\n1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:49.220\n And that gets us into a mess with our health.\n\n1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:51.420\n So if we can get things like game\n\n1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:53.760\n where people love the flavor out of the gate,\n\n1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:55.720\n but it's natural, simple, mentally processed,\n\n1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:56.600\n that's a win.\n\n1:36:56.600 --> 1:37:01.400\n Yeah, it reverses that hyperprocessing trend\n\n1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:03.940\n that we're on as a human species.\n\n1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:07.080\n And that's the promise of regenerative farming,\n\n1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:08.160\n that's the promise of hunting.\n\n1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:10.800\n Obviously, the former can be scaled,\n\n1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:14.080\n the hunting, I think, cannot be scaled, right?\n\n1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:17.760\n But in many ways, the hunting inspires the world\n\n1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:19.520\n that this is the right way to eat.\n\n1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:20.440\n Yes.\n\n1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:24.360\n And that naturally leads to then\n\n1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:28.720\n the humane farming, regenerative farming idea,\n\n1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:31.880\n which is this idea that hunting represents.\n\n1:37:31.880 --> 1:37:33.040\n How do you scale that?\n\n1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:35.560\n Well, if you look at, we're talking about\n\n1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:37.260\n people use this sort of marketing language\n\n1:37:37.260 --> 1:37:39.680\n of happy cows or that kind of thing.\n\n1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:40.840\n You're talking about the happiest animals,\n\n1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:42.160\n it's wild animals, right?\n\n1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:45.400\n So if you wonder why these practices are good,\n\n1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:46.440\n talk to hunters.\n\n1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:47.960\n You're talking about animals that have lived\n\n1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:50.120\n in their evolutionary capacity, right?\n\n1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:51.500\n Who have played their role in the ecosystem,\n\n1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:54.400\n who've lived their meaning of life, right?\n\n1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:58.480\n And that's a very powerfully different kind of role\n\n1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:00.680\n than livestock production.\n\n1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:02.960\n So I think if we can make our livestock production\n\n1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:05.480\n as similar to wild as possible,\n\n1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:07.560\n then we're a lot of steps closer.\n\n1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:10.480\n So you said the animals are happiest in the wild\n\n1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:12.560\n and that's where they find meaning.\n\n1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:14.960\n What about us, the human animal?\n\n1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.920\n What's the meaning for us, do you think?\n\n1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:21.920\n You've monitored the life cycle of a lot of living beings.\n\n1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:23.960\n You ever look in the mirror and think like,\n\n1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:25.520\n why the hell are we humans here?\n\n1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:32.180\n I mean, thriving, reducing suffering, creating goodness.\n\n1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:36.240\n I mean, those are the things I see in animals behavior.\n\n1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:39.880\n They're mostly interested in reducing suffering\n\n1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:42.960\n and nurturing, right?\n\n1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:45.400\n Those are the things that I think evolutionarily.\n\n1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:46.760\n And we humans are just clever\n\n1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.680\n and we wanna be able to try to do that\n\n1:38:48.680 --> 1:38:50.160\n at a bigger and bigger scale.\n\n1:38:51.820 --> 1:38:55.260\n As much as possible, reduce the suffering in the world.\n\n1:38:55.260 --> 1:38:58.560\n And somehow that alleviates us of our own suffering.\n\n1:38:58.560 --> 1:39:01.040\n That's the Russian thing, life is suffering\n\n1:39:01.040 --> 1:39:03.880\n and somehow helping others alleviates it\n\n1:39:03.880 --> 1:39:07.440\n and come up with creative solutions to do that.\n\n1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:08.740\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:14.400\n It's almost consciousness is the thing\n\n1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:17.480\n that led to suffering, but it also led\n\n1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:19.920\n to the desire to alleviate the suffering.\n\n1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:22.080\n It's a feedback loop.\n\n1:39:23.220 --> 1:39:24.560\n Consciousness creates suffering\n\n1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:26.420\n and the desire to alleviate it.\n\n1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:30.300\n Is there yet a pretty nonlinear life?\n\n1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:32.080\n Your parents were professors.\n\n1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:36.660\n You have done a lot of sort of incredible things\n\n1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:38.820\n that many would say kind of like,\n\n1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.620\n how the hell are you gonna get this done?\n\n1:39:40.620 --> 1:39:44.200\n Is there advice you can give to young people today,\n\n1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:48.880\n like high school, college, about how to do,\n\n1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:51.380\n how to live a similarly nonlinear crazy life\n\n1:39:51.380 --> 1:39:54.460\n and accomplish, be as successful as you have been\n\n1:39:54.460 --> 1:39:59.340\n about whether it's just their career or life in general?\n\n1:39:59.340 --> 1:40:04.020\n The greatest gifts I've been given\n\n1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:06.880\n have come from pursuing curiosity.\n\n1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:13.300\n Just trying to understand the thing you're curious about\n\n1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:14.940\n and allowing yourself to be curious about it\n\n1:40:14.940 --> 1:40:16.460\n and just going with it.\n\n1:40:16.460 --> 1:40:21.460\n And also pursuing things that are like deeply joyful for me.\n\n1:40:23.300 --> 1:40:25.580\n Not what society wants, but you just personally,\n\n1:40:25.580 --> 1:40:27.020\n just on your own, you're happy that you did it.\n\n1:40:27.020 --> 1:40:28.580\n And that's something that in the times\n\n1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:32.080\n when I strayed from that, my life has been harder.\n\n1:40:33.420 --> 1:40:37.700\n So it's fundamentally, what are we on earth to do?\n\n1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:39.160\n To live and thrive.\n\n1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:44.160\n And so pursuing things that are curious\n\n1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:47.900\n and satisfying and interesting and joyful\n\n1:40:47.900 --> 1:40:50.340\n and allow me to grow.\n\n1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:55.340\n So I made a number of choices to do things\n\n1:40:55.340 --> 1:41:00.340\n that were more complicated and not considered cool\n\n1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:02.040\n at the time.\n\n1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:03.560\n Although now it's cool to work on farms.\n\n1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:06.560\n It wasn't when I started my career in animal agriculture.\n\n1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:10.040\n And it was like, but just deeply interesting to me.\n\n1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:12.400\n And I felt like there was just lots to learn.\n\n1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:15.360\n And so that's been the path for me\n\n1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.960\n is like going for something that's curious and hard\n\n1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:20.640\n and sticking with it and being open to it.\n\n1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:25.640\n And growing elements that give me joy through that.\n\n1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:29.640\n So I also, for people who are starting out\n\n1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:31.360\n in their careers and want to do something different too,\n\n1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.920\n it's like, get out of your comfort.\n\n1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:35.880\n Go to a place that you've got something to learn from\n\n1:41:35.880 --> 1:41:36.920\n and let it teach you that.\n\n1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.960\n And you'll get beat up.\n\n1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:40.840\n Like I got beat up by that experience.\n\n1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:42.640\n Like it was really hard.\n\n1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:46.640\n I laugh about now working in Sicily for,\n\n1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:50.640\n and the funny experiences I had there, but it was hard.\n\n1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:52.120\n I was lonely and cried a lot.\n\n1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:52.960\n It was stressful.\n\n1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:53.800\n It was like, it was hard.\n\n1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:54.640\n It was really hard.\n\n1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:55.480\n And when you're inside of it,\n\n1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:56.880\n you didn't know how it's going to turn out.\n\n1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:57.720\n You didn't know it's going to turn out well.\n\n1:41:57.720 --> 1:42:00.320\n And I'm like, why didn't I get a job doing something\n\n1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:01.160\n that all my friends are doing?\n\n1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:03.520\n And I didn't speak the language yet.\n\n1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:06.080\n I had to learn foreign language and learn how to function.\n\n1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:09.000\n And it was very lonely and very challenging,\n\n1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:12.400\n but then that's where my resilience started to grow.\n\n1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:14.960\n So the things I learned, they helped me grow.\n\n1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:17.840\n So the things I learned there ended up just being\n\n1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:21.520\n about resilience and understanding the language\n\n1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:23.400\n of subtlety in meaning.\n\n1:42:23.400 --> 1:42:25.360\n So that's something that's carried me through my life.\n\n1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:27.320\n But it was a curiosity about cheese making\n\n1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:29.600\n and about like just living in a village that was there.\n\n1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:30.440\n I'm like, wouldn't it be amazing\n\n1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:32.240\n to just live in a really rural village.\n\n1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:33.080\n And you just went with it.\n\n1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:34.520\n And I just like, this seems incredible\n\n1:42:34.520 --> 1:42:36.280\n and have a place where you can,\n\n1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:40.600\n the people seem interesting, the food seems good.\n\n1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:43.680\n And let's just like try this and see what I can learn.\n\n1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.160\n And that like putting yourself out of your comfort zone\n\n1:42:47.160 --> 1:42:48.720\n in a place where you have a chance to learn\n\n1:42:48.720 --> 1:42:51.960\n and grow is the secret.\n\n1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:55.080\n Because it's, you grow through discomfort.\n\n1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:57.600\n People think that you grow when you get\n\n1:42:57.600 --> 1:42:58.800\n into this environment where everything's\n\n1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:00.760\n like kind of sailing along,\n\n1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:02.920\n but like growth actually comes through pain.\n\n1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:06.680\n It's like growth comes from being cut down\n\n1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.200\n and beat down and having to regrow and double down.\n\n1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:13.200\n And so that kind of opportunity,\n\n1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:14.040\n you have to seek it out.\n\n1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:16.200\n You have to put yourself in the line of fire a bit.\n\n1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:18.280\n If the situation sucks,\n\n1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:21.200\n it's a sign that you might be doing something right\n\n1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:23.000\n in the sense that you're on the path\n\n1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:26.160\n at the end of which you'll be a better person\n\n1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:27.840\n if you allow yourself to grow in that way.\n\n1:43:27.840 --> 1:43:29.560\n Like as opposed to resisting it,\n\n1:43:29.560 --> 1:43:33.440\n just going along with the journey and persevering.\n\n1:43:33.440 --> 1:43:37.040\n And that ended us up in this incredible place.\n\n1:43:37.040 --> 1:43:40.440\n This whole conversation, I'll probably overlay a video.\n\n1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:43.200\n I'm looking at a gorgeous mountain\n\n1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:45.440\n and it's an incredible farm.\n\n1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:47.320\n Thank you so much for a meal yesterday.\n\n1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:48.320\n That was incredible.\n\n1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:51.400\n The cheese, the fish eggs,\n\n1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:53.760\n just everything about this place.\n\n1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:56.200\n Looking up, you can see the stars.\n\n1:43:56.200 --> 1:43:58.160\n The stars at night are beautiful\n\n1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.160\n and there's a peacefulness to it.\n\n1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:02.960\n I had a pretty hard week actually,\n\n1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:05.480\n just emotionally in many ways.\n\n1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.240\n And just coming here, it's immediately,\n\n1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:08.360\n so much of it is lifted.\n\n1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:11.440\n So I really deeply appreciate Anya\n\n1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:13.080\n that you would invite me here\n\n1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:15.160\n and that you have this conversation.\n\n1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:16.240\n This was really awesome.\n\n1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:17.440\n So thank you so much.\n\n1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:18.280\n Thank you.\n\n1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.160\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:24.440\n with Anya Fernald and thank you to Gala Games,\n\n1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:28.600\n Athletic Greens, Four Sigmatic and Fundrise.\n\n1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:32.080\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:33.880\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:36.240\n from the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.\n\n1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:41.080\n Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.\n\n1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:43.160\n Thank you for listening.\n\n1:44:43.160 --> 1:45:10.160\n I hope to see you next time.\n\n"
