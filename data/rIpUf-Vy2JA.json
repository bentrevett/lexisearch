one of the most fascinating minds in the world,\n\n00:08.540 --> 00:10.620\n exploring the nature of intelligence,\n\n00:10.620 --> 00:14.500\n cognition, computation, and consciousness.\n\n00:14.500 --> 00:17.700\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors,\n\n00:17.700 --> 00:22.700\n Coinbase, Codecademy, Linode, NetSuite, and ExpressVPN.\n\n00:23.940 --> 00:26.740\n Their links are in the description.\n\n00:26.740 --> 00:28.980\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n00:28.980 --> 00:32.420\n and here is my conversation with Yosha Bach.\n\n00:33.340 --> 00:35.180\n Thank you for once again coming on\n\n00:35.180 --> 00:38.220\n to this particular Russian program\n\n00:38.220 --> 00:40.740\n and sticking to the theme of a Russian program.\n\n00:40.740 --> 00:43.100\n Let's start with the darkest of topics.\n\n00:43.100 --> 00:43.940\n Kriviyat.\n\n00:45.220 --> 00:48.380\n So this is inspired by one of your tweets.\n\n00:48.380 --> 00:50.900\n You wrote that, quote,\n\n00:50.900 --> 00:52.660\n when life feels unbearable,\n\n00:53.740 --> 00:56.620\n I remind myself that I'm not a person.\n\n00:56.620 --> 00:58.940\n I am a piece of software running on the brain\n\n00:58.940 --> 01:01.500\n of a random ape for a few decades.\n\n01:01.500 --> 01:03.360\n It's not the worst brain to run on.\n\n01:04.540 --> 01:07.740\n Have you experienced low points in your life?\n\n01:07.740 --> 01:09.780\n Have you experienced depression?\n\n01:09.780 --> 01:12.140\n Of course, we all experience low points in our life,\n\n01:12.140 --> 01:15.340\n and we get appalled by the things,\n\n01:15.340 --> 01:17.060\n by the ugliness of stuff around us.\n\n01:17.060 --> 01:21.300\n We might get desperate about our lack of self regulation,\n\n01:21.300 --> 01:24.580\n and sometimes life is hard,\n\n01:24.580 --> 01:27.900\n and I suspect you don't get to your life,\n\n01:27.900 --> 01:30.700\n nobody does, to get through their life without low points\n\n01:30.700 --> 01:33.740\n and without moments where they're despairing.\n\n01:33.740 --> 01:37.800\n And I thought that let's capture this state\n\n01:37.800 --> 01:40.140\n and how to deal with that state.\n\n01:40.140 --> 01:43.120\n And I found that very often you realize\n\n01:43.120 --> 01:44.860\n that when you stop taking things personally,\n\n01:44.860 --> 01:48.980\n when you realize that this notion of a person is a fiction,\n\n01:48.980 --> 01:50.700\n similar as it is in Westworld,\n\n01:50.700 --> 01:53.300\n where the robots realize that their memories and desires\n\n01:53.300 --> 01:55.840\n are the stuff that keeps them in the loop,\n\n01:55.840 --> 01:59.100\n and they don't have to act on those memories and desires,\n\n01:59.100 --> 02:02.540\n that our memories and expectations is what make us unhappy.\n\n02:02.540 --> 02:04.200\n And the present really does.\n\n02:04.200 --> 02:08.300\n The day in which we are, for the most part, it's okay, right?\n\n02:08.300 --> 02:11.260\n When we are sitting here, right here, right now,\n\n02:11.260 --> 02:13.100\n we can choose how we feel.\n\n02:13.100 --> 02:16.740\n And the thing that affects us is the expectation\n\n02:16.740 --> 02:18.760\n that something is going to be different\n\n02:18.760 --> 02:19.920\n from what we want it to be,\n\n02:19.920 --> 02:21.860\n or the memory that something was different\n\n02:21.860 --> 02:24.140\n from what you wanted it to be.\n\n02:24.140 --> 02:27.340\n And once we basically zoom out from all this,\n\n02:27.340 --> 02:28.980\n what's left is not a person.\n\n02:28.980 --> 02:32.300\n What's left is this state of being conscious,\n\n02:32.300 --> 02:33.620\n which is a software state.\n\n02:33.620 --> 02:35.680\n And software doesn't have an identity.\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:36.780\n It's a physical law.\n\n02:37.820 --> 02:39.820\n And it's a law that acts in all of us,\n\n02:39.820 --> 02:42.300\n and it's embedded in a suitable substrate.\n\n02:42.300 --> 02:43.780\n And we didn't pick that substrate, right?\n\n02:43.780 --> 02:46.940\n We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.\n\n02:46.940 --> 02:48.900\n And they're all these individuals,\n\n02:48.900 --> 02:51.740\n and everybody has to be one of them.\n\n02:51.740 --> 02:54.220\n And eventually you're stuck on one of them,\n\n02:54.220 --> 02:56.340\n and have to deal with that.\n\n02:56.340 --> 02:59.080\n So you're like a leaf floating down the river.\n\n02:59.080 --> 03:01.340\n You just have to accept that there's a river,\n\n03:01.340 --> 03:03.820\n and you just float wherever it takes you.\n\n03:03.820 --> 03:04.660\n You don't have to do this.\n\n03:04.660 --> 03:08.140\n The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent\n\n03:08.140 --> 03:09.500\n is a construct.\n\n03:09.500 --> 03:13.100\n What part of that is actually under your control?\n\n03:13.100 --> 03:15.260\n And I think that our consciousness\n\n03:15.260 --> 03:18.460\n is largely a control model for our own attention.\n\n03:18.460 --> 03:21.160\n So we notice where we are looking,\n\n03:21.160 --> 03:22.740\n and we can influence what we're looking,\n\n03:22.740 --> 03:24.180\n how we are disambiguating things,\n\n03:24.180 --> 03:26.580\n how we put things together in our mind.\n\n03:26.580 --> 03:28.780\n And the whole system that runs us\n\n03:28.780 --> 03:30.940\n is this big cybernetic motivational system.\n\n03:30.940 --> 03:32.940\n So we're basically like a little monkey\n\n03:32.940 --> 03:34.940\n sitting on top of an elephant,\n\n03:34.940 --> 03:37.540\n and we can put this elephant here and there\n\n03:37.540 --> 03:39.360\n to go this way or that way.\n\n03:39.360 --> 03:42.020\n And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant,\n\n03:42.020 --> 03:43.460\n or that we are telling it what to do.\n\n03:43.460 --> 03:45.620\n And sometimes we notice that it walks\n\n03:45.620 --> 03:47.460\n into a completely different direction.\n\n03:47.460 --> 03:49.000\n And we didn't set this thing up.\n\n03:49.000 --> 03:52.620\n It just is the situation that we find ourselves in.\n\n03:52.620 --> 03:55.220\n How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?\n\n03:56.420 --> 03:57.380\n A lot.\n\n03:57.380 --> 04:00.660\n But I think that our consciousness\n\n04:00.660 --> 04:03.000\n cannot create the motive force.\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:05.340\n Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?\n\n04:05.340 --> 04:07.940\n No, the monkey is the consciousness.\n\n04:07.940 --> 04:09.340\n The monkey is the attentional system\n\n04:09.340 --> 04:10.460\n that is observing things.\n\n04:10.460 --> 04:12.380\n There is a large perceptual system\n\n04:12.380 --> 04:14.300\n combined with a motivational system\n\n04:14.300 --> 04:17.260\n that is actually providing the interface to everything\n\n04:17.260 --> 04:18.660\n and our own consciousness.\n\n04:18.660 --> 04:21.820\n I think is the tool that directs the attention\n\n04:21.820 --> 04:24.740\n of that system, which means it singles out features\n\n04:24.740 --> 04:26.980\n and performs conditional operations\n\n04:26.980 --> 04:28.900\n for which it needs an index memory.\n\n04:28.900 --> 04:31.420\n But this index memory is what we perceive\n\n04:31.420 --> 04:32.740\n as our stream of consciousness.\n\n04:32.740 --> 04:34.900\n But the consciousness is not in charge.\n\n04:34.900 --> 04:35.860\n That's an illusion.\n\n04:35.860 --> 04:40.300\n So everything outside of that consciousness\n\n04:40.300 --> 04:41.380\n is the elephant.\n\n04:41.380 --> 04:43.060\n So it's the physics of the universe,\n\n04:43.060 --> 04:46.140\n but it's also society that's outside of your...\n\n04:46.140 --> 04:48.300\n I would say the elephant is the agent.\n\n04:48.300 --> 04:51.300\n So there is an environment to which the agent is stomping\n\n04:51.300 --> 04:55.100\n and you are influencing a little part of that agent.\n\n04:55.100 --> 04:58.980\n So is the agent a single human being?\n\n04:58.980 --> 05:02.340\n Which object has agency?\n\n05:02.340 --> 05:03.820\n That's an interesting question.\n\n05:03.820 --> 05:06.140\n I think a way to think about an agent\n\n05:06.140 --> 05:09.660\n is that it's a controller with a set point generator.\n\n05:10.500 --> 05:13.020\n The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics\n\n05:13.020 --> 05:14.380\n and control theory.\n\n05:14.380 --> 05:17.780\n Control system consists out of a system\n\n05:17.780 --> 05:20.860\n that is regulating some value\n\n05:20.860 --> 05:23.980\n and the deviation of that value from a set point.\n\n05:23.980 --> 05:27.500\n And it has a sensor that measures the system's deviation\n\n05:27.500 --> 05:30.060\n from that set point and an effector\n\n05:30.060 --> 05:32.580\n that can be parametrized by the controller.\n\n05:32.580 --> 05:35.500\n So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.\n\n05:35.500 --> 05:38.460\n And the goal is to reduce the distance\n\n05:38.460 --> 05:40.860\n between the set point and the current value of the system.\n\n05:40.860 --> 05:41.700\n And there's an environment\n\n05:41.700 --> 05:43.580\n which disturbs the regulated system,\n\n05:43.580 --> 05:45.580\n which brings it away from that set point.\n\n05:45.580 --> 05:47.860\n So simplest case is a thermostat.\n\n05:47.860 --> 05:49.100\n The thermostat is really simple\n\n05:49.100 --> 05:50.260\n because it doesn't have a model.\n\n05:50.260 --> 05:52.380\n The thermostat is only trying to minimize\n\n05:52.380 --> 05:54.940\n the set point deviation in the next moment.\n\n05:55.780 --> 05:58.740\n And if you want to minimize the set point deviation\n\n05:58.740 --> 06:00.860\n over a longer time span, you need to integrate it.\n\n06:00.860 --> 06:03.660\n You need to model what is going to happen.\n\n06:03.660 --> 06:05.700\n So for instance, when you think about\n\n06:05.700 --> 06:08.220\n that your set point is to be comfortable in life,\n\n06:08.220 --> 06:11.420\n maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first, right?\n\n06:11.420 --> 06:14.060\n So you need to make a model of what's going to happen when.\n\n06:14.060 --> 06:18.020\n And this is task of the controller is to use its sensors\n\n06:18.020 --> 06:20.540\n to measure the state of the environment\n\n06:20.540 --> 06:22.900\n and the system that is being regulated\n\n06:22.900 --> 06:24.900\n and figure out what to do.\n\n06:24.900 --> 06:27.620\n And if the task is complex enough,\n\n06:27.620 --> 06:30.100\n the set points are complicated enough.\n\n06:30.100 --> 06:32.540\n And if the controller has enough capacity\n\n06:32.540 --> 06:34.940\n and enough sensor feedback,\n\n06:34.940 --> 06:37.340\n then the task of the controller is to make a model\n\n06:37.340 --> 06:39.180\n of the entire universe that it's in,\n\n06:39.180 --> 06:42.300\n the conditions under which it exists and of itself.\n\n06:42.300 --> 06:43.940\n And this is a very complex agent.\n\n06:43.940 --> 06:45.820\n And we are in that category.\n\n06:45.820 --> 06:49.460\n And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.\n\n06:49.460 --> 06:51.700\n It's a class of models that we use\n\n06:51.700 --> 06:54.580\n to interpret aspects of the universe.\n\n06:54.580 --> 06:57.820\n And when we notice the environment around us,\n\n06:57.820 --> 06:59.460\n a lot of things only make sense\n\n06:59.460 --> 07:01.060\n at the level that should be entangled with them\n\n07:01.060 --> 07:03.340\n if we interpret them as control systems\n\n07:03.340 --> 07:04.700\n that make models of the world\n\n07:04.700 --> 07:07.380\n and try to minimize their own set points.\n\n07:07.380 --> 07:10.580\n So the models are the agents.\n\n07:10.580 --> 07:12.580\n The agent is a class of model.\n\n07:12.580 --> 07:14.660\n And we notice that we are an agent ourselves.\n\n07:14.660 --> 07:17.780\n We are the agent that is using our own control model\n\n07:17.780 --> 07:18.820\n to perform actions.\n\n07:18.820 --> 07:22.100\n We notice we produce a change in the model\n\n07:22.100 --> 07:23.460\n and things in the world change.\n\n07:23.460 --> 07:26.740\n And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body,\n\n07:26.740 --> 07:28.260\n that we are situated environment,\n\n07:28.260 --> 07:31.140\n and that we have a first person perspective.\n\n07:31.140 --> 07:34.980\n Still don't understand what's the best way to think\n\n07:34.980 --> 07:39.820\n of which object has agency with respect to human beings.\n\n07:39.820 --> 07:41.540\n Is it the body?\n\n07:41.540 --> 07:43.420\n Is it the brain?\n\n07:43.420 --> 07:46.020\n Is it the contents of the brain as agency?\n\n07:46.020 --> 07:49.020\n Like what's the actuators that you're referring to?\n\n07:49.020 --> 07:52.100\n What is the controller and where does it reside?\n\n07:52.100 --> 07:54.100\n Or is it these impossible things?\n\n07:54.100 --> 07:57.740\n Because I keep trying to ground it to space time,\n\n07:57.740 --> 08:01.580\n the three dimension of space and the one dimension of time.\n\n08:01.580 --> 08:04.580\n What's the agent in that for humans?\n\n08:04.580 --> 08:06.020\n There is not just one.\n\n08:06.020 --> 08:08.260\n It depends on the way in which you're looking\n\n08:08.260 --> 08:10.060\n at this thing in which you're framing it.\n\n08:10.060 --> 08:13.540\n Imagine that you are, say Angela Merkel,\n\n08:13.540 --> 08:16.660\n and you are acting on behalf of Germany.\n\n08:16.660 --> 08:19.820\n Then you could say that Germany is the agent.\n\n08:19.820 --> 08:21.580\n And in the mind of Angela Merkel,\n\n08:21.580 --> 08:23.540\n she is Germany to some extent,\n\n08:23.540 --> 08:25.660\n because in the way in which she acts,\n\n08:25.660 --> 08:28.060\n the destiny of Germany changes.\n\n08:28.060 --> 08:29.700\n There are things that she can change\n\n08:29.700 --> 08:33.580\n that basically affect the behavior of that nation state.\n\n08:33.580 --> 08:35.060\n Okay, so it's hierarchies of,\n\n08:35.060 --> 08:37.460\n to go to another one of your tweets\n\n08:37.460 --> 08:42.380\n with I think you were playfully mocking Jeff Hawkins\n\n08:42.380 --> 08:44.420\n with saying his brain's all the way down.\n\n08:45.820 --> 08:49.020\n So it's like, it's agents all the way down.\n\n08:49.020 --> 08:51.780\n It's agents made up of agents, made up of agents.\n\n08:51.780 --> 08:54.700\n Like if Angela Merkel's Germany\n\n08:54.700 --> 08:56.540\n and Germany's made up a bunch of people\n\n08:56.540 --> 08:58.860\n and the people are themselves agents\n\n08:58.860 --> 09:01.060\n in some kind of context.\n\n09:01.060 --> 09:04.900\n And then people are made up of cells, each individual.\n\n09:04.900 --> 09:07.220\n So is it agents all the way down?\n\n09:07.220 --> 09:08.900\n I suspect that has to be like this\n\n09:08.900 --> 09:12.900\n in a world where things are self organizing.\n\n09:12.900 --> 09:15.660\n Most of the complexity that we are looking at,\n\n09:15.660 --> 09:18.540\n everything in life is about self organization.\n\n09:18.540 --> 09:23.540\n So I think up from the level of life, you have agents.\n\n09:24.220 --> 09:27.460\n And below life, you rarely have agents\n\n09:27.460 --> 09:30.060\n because sometimes you have control systems\n\n09:30.060 --> 09:31.580\n that emerge randomly in nature\n\n09:31.580 --> 09:33.740\n and try to achieve a set point,\n\n09:33.740 --> 09:36.660\n but they're not that interesting agents that make models.\n\n09:36.660 --> 09:39.580\n And because to make an interesting model of the world,\n\n09:39.580 --> 09:42.380\n you typically need a system that is true and complete.\n\n09:42.380 --> 09:44.100\n Can I ask you a personal question?\n\n09:46.140 --> 09:48.740\n What's the line between life and non life?\n\n09:48.740 --> 09:52.300\n It's personal because you're a life form.\n\n09:52.300 --> 09:55.740\n So what do you think in this emerging complexity,\n\n09:55.740 --> 09:57.980\n at which point does the things that are being living\n\n09:57.980 --> 09:59.100\n and have agency?\n\n10:00.220 --> 10:01.900\n Personally, I think that the simplest answer\n\n10:01.900 --> 10:04.540\n that is that life is cells because...\n\n10:04.540 --> 10:05.380\n Life is what?\n\n10:05.380 --> 10:06.220\n Cells.\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:07.060\n Biological cells.\n\n10:07.060 --> 10:07.900\n Biological cells.\n\n10:07.900 --> 10:09.420\n So it's a particular kind of principle\n\n10:09.420 --> 10:11.860\n that we have discovered to exist in nature.\n\n10:11.860 --> 10:14.540\n It's modular stuff that consists\n\n10:14.540 --> 10:17.820\n out of basically this DNA tape\n\n10:17.820 --> 10:20.180\n with a read write head on top of it,\n\n10:20.180 --> 10:23.220\n that is able to perform arbitrary computations\n\n10:23.220 --> 10:25.300\n and state transitions within the cell.\n\n10:25.300 --> 10:27.380\n And it's combined with a membrane\n\n10:27.380 --> 10:30.540\n that insulates the cell from its environment.\n\n10:30.540 --> 10:34.780\n And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell\n\n10:34.780 --> 10:36.300\n that are in disequilibrium.\n\n10:36.300 --> 10:38.740\n And the cell is running in such a way\n\n10:38.740 --> 10:41.460\n that this disequilibrium doesn't disappear.\n\n10:41.460 --> 10:46.260\n And the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.\n\n10:46.260 --> 10:50.100\n And it requires something like an neck entropy extractor\n\n10:50.100 --> 10:51.900\n to maintain this disequilibrium.\n\n10:51.900 --> 10:55.700\n So it's able to harvest like entropy from its environment\n\n10:55.700 --> 10:57.820\n and keep itself running.\n\n10:57.820 --> 11:00.540\n Yeah, so there's information and there's a wall\n\n11:00.540 --> 11:04.100\n to maintain this disequilibrium.\n\n11:04.100 --> 11:06.660\n But isn't this very earth centric?\n\n11:06.660 --> 11:08.740\n Like what you're referring to as a...\n\n11:08.740 --> 11:10.660\n I'm not making a normative notion.\n\n11:10.660 --> 11:13.100\n You could say that there are probably other things\n\n11:13.100 --> 11:16.380\n in the universe that are cell like and life like,\n\n11:16.380 --> 11:17.860\n and you could also call them life,\n\n11:17.860 --> 11:21.220\n but eventually it's just a willingness\n\n11:21.220 --> 11:23.820\n to find an agreement of how to use the terms.\n\n11:23.820 --> 11:26.580\n I like cells because it's completely coextential\n\n11:26.580 --> 11:28.500\n with the way that we use the word\n\n11:28.500 --> 11:30.340\n even before we knew about cells.\n\n11:30.340 --> 11:32.380\n So people were pointing at some stuff\n\n11:32.380 --> 11:34.260\n and saying, this is somehow animate.\n\n11:34.260 --> 11:36.620\n And this is very different from the non animate stuff.\n\n11:36.620 --> 11:38.900\n And what's the difference between the living\n\n11:38.900 --> 11:40.140\n and the dead stuff.\n\n11:40.140 --> 11:42.860\n And it's mostly whether the cells are working or not.\n\n11:42.860 --> 11:45.340\n And also this boundary of life,\n\n11:45.340 --> 11:46.820\n where we say that for instance, the virus\n\n11:46.820 --> 11:48.820\n is basically an information packet\n\n11:48.820 --> 11:51.500\n that is subverting the cell and not life by itself.\n\n11:52.500 --> 11:54.100\n That makes sense to me.\n\n11:54.100 --> 11:55.860\n And it's somewhat arbitrary.\n\n11:55.860 --> 11:57.940\n You could of course say that systems\n\n11:57.940 --> 12:00.140\n that permanently maintain a disequilibrium\n\n12:00.140 --> 12:03.340\n and can self replicate are always life.\n\n12:03.340 --> 12:06.460\n And maybe that's a useful definition too,\n\n12:06.460 --> 12:10.420\n but this is eventually just how you want to use the word.\n\n12:10.420 --> 12:12.620\n Is it so useful for conversation,\n\n12:12.620 --> 12:17.340\n but is it somehow fundamental to the universe?\n\n12:17.340 --> 12:19.300\n Do you think there's a actual line\n\n12:19.300 --> 12:21.860\n to eventually be drawn between life and non life?\n\n12:21.860 --> 12:24.300\n Or is it all a kind of continuum?\n\n12:24.300 --> 12:25.460\n I don't think it's a continuum,\n\n12:25.460 --> 12:28.140\n but there's nothing magical that is happening.\n\n12:28.140 --> 12:31.140\n Living systems are a certain type of machine.\n\n12:31.140 --> 12:32.980\n What about non living systems?\n\n12:32.980 --> 12:34.300\n Is it also a machine?\n\n12:34.300 --> 12:35.980\n There are non living machines,\n\n12:35.980 --> 12:38.540\n but the question is at which point is a system\n\n12:38.540 --> 12:43.100\n able to perform arbitrary state transitions\n\n12:43.100 --> 12:44.940\n to make representations.\n\n12:44.940 --> 12:46.820\n And living things can do this.\n\n12:46.820 --> 12:48.980\n And of course we can also build non living things\n\n12:48.980 --> 12:52.220\n that can do this, but we don't know anything in nature\n\n12:52.220 --> 12:56.180\n that is not a cell and is not created by still alive\n\n12:56.180 --> 12:58.580\n that is able to do that.\n\n12:58.580 --> 13:02.860\n Not only do we not know,\n\n13:02.860 --> 13:05.980\n I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise.\n\n13:05.980 --> 13:10.980\n I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly.\n\n13:11.140 --> 13:14.900\n Like there could be life of a very different kind\n\n13:14.900 --> 13:18.860\n right under our noses that we're just not seeing\n\n13:18.860 --> 13:21.700\n because we're not either limitations\n\n13:21.700 --> 13:23.260\n of our cognitive capacity,\n\n13:23.260 --> 13:26.980\n or we're just not open minded enough\n\n13:26.980 --> 13:28.380\n either with the tools of science\n\n13:28.380 --> 13:31.100\n or just the tools of our mind.\n\n13:32.020 --> 13:33.020\n Yeah, that's possible.\n\n13:33.020 --> 13:35.060\n I find this thought very fascinating.\n\n13:35.060 --> 13:39.020\n And I suspect that many of us ask ourselves since childhood,\n\n13:39.020 --> 13:40.580\n what are the things that we are missing?\n\n13:40.580 --> 13:43.660\n What kind of systems and interconnections exist\n\n13:43.660 --> 13:46.380\n that are outside of our gaze?\n\n13:47.900 --> 13:51.140\n But we are looking for it\n\n13:51.140 --> 13:55.140\n and physics doesn't have much room at the moment\n\n13:55.140 --> 13:59.580\n for opening up something that would not violate\n\n13:59.580 --> 14:01.940\n the conservation of information as we know it.\n\n14:03.300 --> 14:06.860\n Yeah, but I wonder about time scale and scale,\n\n14:06.860 --> 14:11.860\n spatial scale, whether we just need to open up our idea\n\n14:11.860 --> 14:15.300\n of what, like how life presents itself.\n\n14:15.300 --> 14:17.860\n It could be operating in a much slower time scale,\n\n14:17.860 --> 14:20.060\n a much faster time scale.\n\n14:20.060 --> 14:23.940\n And it's almost sad to think that there's all this life\n\n14:23.940 --> 14:25.340\n around us that we're not seeing\n\n14:25.340 --> 14:29.220\n because we're just not like thinking\n\n14:29.220 --> 14:34.220\n in terms of the right scale, both time and space.\n\n14:34.380 --> 14:36.060\n What is your definition of life?\n\n14:36.060 --> 14:37.660\n What do you understand as life?\n\n14:40.780 --> 14:44.500\n Entities of sufficiently high complexity\n\n14:44.500 --> 14:46.140\n that are full of surprises.\n\n14:46.140 --> 14:51.140\n I don't know, I don't have a free will.\n\n14:53.980 --> 14:55.620\n So that just came out of my mouth.\n\n14:55.620 --> 14:57.260\n I'm not sure that even makes sense.\n\n14:57.260 --> 14:59.180\n There's certain characteristics.\n\n14:59.180 --> 15:04.140\n So complexity seems to be a necessary property of life.\n\n15:04.140 --> 15:09.140\n And I almost want to say it has ability\n\n15:09.980 --> 15:11.820\n to do something unexpected.\n\n15:13.340 --> 15:15.460\n It seems to me that life is the main source\n\n15:15.460 --> 15:16.900\n of complexity on earth.\n\n15:18.660 --> 15:19.500\n Yes.\n\n15:19.500 --> 15:22.060\n And complexity is basically a bridgehead\n\n15:22.060 --> 15:27.220\n that order builds into chaos by modeling,\n\n15:27.220 --> 15:29.020\n by processing information in such a way\n\n15:29.020 --> 15:31.220\n that you can perform reactions\n\n15:31.220 --> 15:33.780\n that would not be possible for dump systems.\n\n15:33.780 --> 15:36.020\n And this means that you can harvest neck entropy\n\n15:36.020 --> 15:37.780\n that dump systems cannot harvest.\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:40.140\n And this is what complexity is mostly about.\n\n15:40.140 --> 15:45.060\n In some sense, the purpose of life is to create complexity.\n\n15:45.060 --> 15:46.020\n Yeah.\n\n15:46.020 --> 15:46.860\n Increasing.\n\n15:46.860 --> 15:51.860\n I mean, there seems to be some kind of universal drive\n\n15:52.340 --> 15:54.820\n towards increasing pockets of complexity.\n\n15:56.180 --> 15:57.580\n I don't know what that is.\n\n15:57.580 --> 16:00.020\n That seems to be like a fundamental,\n\n16:00.020 --> 16:02.340\n I don't know if it's a property of the universe\n\n16:02.340 --> 16:05.860\n or it's just a consequence of the way the universe works,\n\n16:05.860 --> 16:08.700\n but there seems to be this small pockets\n\n16:08.700 --> 16:11.380\n of emergent complexity that builds on top of each other\n\n16:11.380 --> 16:15.380\n and starts having like greater and greater complexity\n\n16:15.380 --> 16:17.980\n by having like a hierarchy of complexity.\n\n16:17.980 --> 16:20.700\n Little organisms building up a little society\n\n16:20.700 --> 16:24.060\n that then operates almost as an individual organism itself.\n\n16:24.060 --> 16:27.660\n And all of a sudden you have Germany and Merkel.\n\n16:27.660 --> 16:28.860\n Well, that's not obvious to me.\n\n16:28.860 --> 16:32.500\n Everything that goes up has to come down at some point.\n\n16:32.500 --> 16:36.500\n So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere,\n\n16:36.500 --> 16:39.380\n it's usually the beginning of an S curve\n\n16:39.380 --> 16:41.420\n where something eventually reaches saturation.\n\n16:41.420 --> 16:43.820\n And the S curve is the beginning of some kind of bump\n\n16:43.820 --> 16:45.500\n that goes down again.\n\n16:45.500 --> 16:49.180\n And there is just this thing that when you are\n\n16:49.180 --> 16:53.220\n in sight of an evolution of life,\n\n16:53.220 --> 16:55.820\n you are on top of a puddle of negentropy\n\n16:55.820 --> 16:58.900\n that is being sucked dry by life.\n\n16:58.900 --> 17:00.660\n And during that happening,\n\n17:00.660 --> 17:02.940\n you see an increase in complexity\n\n17:02.940 --> 17:04.780\n because life forms are competing with each other\n\n17:04.780 --> 17:09.340\n to get more and more finer and finer corner\n\n17:09.340 --> 17:11.620\n of that negentropy extraction.\n\n17:11.620 --> 17:13.900\n I feel like that's a gradual beautiful process\n\n17:13.900 --> 17:18.100\n like that's almost follows a process akin to evolution.\n\n17:18.100 --> 17:22.900\n And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.\n\n17:22.900 --> 17:26.460\n The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly.\n\n17:27.380 --> 17:30.620\n So usually there's some kind of catastrophic event.\n\n17:30.620 --> 17:32.380\n The Roman Empire took a long time.\n\n17:32.380 --> 17:36.340\n But would that be,\n\n17:36.340 --> 17:39.420\n would you classify this as a decrease in complexity though?\n\n17:39.420 --> 17:40.260\n Yes.\n\n17:40.260 --> 17:42.900\n I think that this size of the cities that could be fed\n\n17:42.900 --> 17:44.740\n has decreased dramatically.\n\n17:44.740 --> 17:47.820\n And you could see that the quality of the art decreased\n\n17:47.820 --> 17:49.940\n and it did so gradually.\n\n17:49.940 --> 17:53.260\n And maybe future generations,\n\n17:53.260 --> 17:55.660\n when they look at the history of the United States\n\n17:55.660 --> 17:57.380\n in the 21st century,\n\n17:57.380 --> 17:59.140\n will also talk about the gradual decline,\n\n17:59.140 --> 18:04.140\n not something that suddenly happens.\n\n18:05.620 --> 18:07.700\n Do you have a sense of where we are?\n\n18:07.700 --> 18:09.740\n Are we on the exponential rise?\n\n18:09.740 --> 18:11.260\n Are we at the peak?\n\n18:11.260 --> 18:15.740\n Or are we at the downslope of the United States empire?\n\n18:15.740 --> 18:18.460\n It's very hard to say from a single human perspective,\n\n18:18.460 --> 18:23.460\n but it seems to me that we are probably at the peak.\n\n18:25.380 --> 18:28.100\n I think that's probably the definition of like optimism\n\n18:28.100 --> 18:29.620\n and cynicism.\n\n18:29.620 --> 18:31.540\n So my nature of optimism is,\n\n18:31.540 --> 18:32.940\n I think we're on the rise.\n\n18:36.940 --> 18:39.300\n I think this is just all a matter of perspective.\n\n18:39.300 --> 18:40.140\n Nobody knows,\n\n18:40.140 --> 18:43.260\n but I do think that erring on the side of optimism,\n\n18:43.260 --> 18:45.420\n like you need a sufficient number,\n\n18:45.420 --> 18:47.460\n you need a minimum number of optimists\n\n18:47.460 --> 18:50.980\n in order to make that up thing actually work.\n\n18:50.980 --> 18:53.620\n And so I tend to be on the side of the optimists.\n\n18:53.620 --> 18:56.540\n I think that we are basically a species of grasshoppers\n\n18:56.540 --> 18:58.620\n that have turned into locusts.\n\n18:58.620 --> 19:00.740\n And when you are in that locust mode,\n\n19:00.740 --> 19:04.100\n you see an amazing rise of population numbers\n\n19:04.100 --> 19:07.020\n and of the complexity of the interactions\n\n19:07.020 --> 19:08.780\n between the individuals.\n\n19:08.780 --> 19:12.860\n But it's ultimately the question is, is it sustainable?\n\n19:12.860 --> 19:16.140\n See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers\n\n19:16.140 --> 19:18.860\n that have become domesticated cats,\n\n19:20.220 --> 19:21.420\n to use a different metaphor.\n\n19:21.420 --> 19:24.300\n As I'm not exactly sure we're so destructive,\n\n19:24.300 --> 19:27.820\n we're just softer and nicer and lazier.\n\n19:27.820 --> 19:29.900\n But I think we have monkeys and not the cats.\n\n19:29.900 --> 19:32.460\n And if you look at the monkeys, they are very busy.\n\n19:33.620 --> 19:35.820\n The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?\n\n19:35.820 --> 19:37.180\n Not just the bonobos.\n\n19:37.180 --> 19:38.940\n I think that all the monkeys are basically\n\n19:38.940 --> 19:41.340\n a discontent species that always needs to meddle.\n\n19:42.700 --> 19:44.180\n Well, the gorillas seem to have\n\n19:44.180 --> 19:45.900\n a little bit more of a structure,\n\n19:45.900 --> 19:48.260\n but it's a different part of the tree.\n\n19:50.620 --> 19:52.900\n Okay, you mentioned the elephant\n\n19:52.900 --> 19:55.660\n and the monkey riding the elephant.\n\n19:55.660 --> 19:58.700\n And consciousness is the monkey.\n\n20:00.300 --> 20:03.180\n And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.\n\n20:03.180 --> 20:05.180\n And sometimes the elephant listens.\n\n20:06.180 --> 20:08.940\n I heard you got into some contentious,\n\n20:08.940 --> 20:09.820\n maybe you can correct me,\n\n20:09.820 --> 20:11.540\n but I heard you got into some contentious\n\n20:11.540 --> 20:12.900\n free will discussions.\n\n20:13.900 --> 20:16.100\n Is this with Sam Harris or something like that?\n\n20:16.100 --> 20:17.300\n Not that I know of.\n\n20:18.700 --> 20:20.460\n Some people on Clubhouse told me\n\n20:20.460 --> 20:25.460\n you made a bunch of big debate points about free will.\n\n20:25.940 --> 20:28.860\n Well, let me just then ask you where,\n\n20:28.860 --> 20:31.700\n in terms of the monkey and the elephant,\n\n20:31.700 --> 20:35.300\n do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will?\n\n20:35.300 --> 20:37.300\n How much control does the monkey have?\n\n20:38.580 --> 20:41.460\n We have to think about what the free will is\n\n20:41.460 --> 20:43.260\n in the first place.\n\n20:43.260 --> 20:44.420\n We are not the machine.\n\n20:44.420 --> 20:46.820\n We are not the thing that is making the decisions.\n\n20:46.820 --> 20:49.900\n We are a model of that decision making process.\n\n20:49.900 --> 20:54.220\n And there is a difference between making your own decisions\n\n20:54.220 --> 20:56.180\n and predicting your own decisions.\n\n20:56.180 --> 20:58.740\n And that difference is the first person perspective.\n\n20:59.860 --> 21:04.820\n And what basically makes decision making\n\n21:04.820 --> 21:06.620\n and the conditions of free will distinct\n\n21:06.620 --> 21:10.340\n from just automatically doing the best thing is\n\n21:10.340 --> 21:13.260\n that we often don't know what the best thing is.\n\n21:13.260 --> 21:15.540\n We make decisions under uncertainty.\n\n21:15.540 --> 21:17.900\n We make informed bets using a betting algorithm\n\n21:17.900 --> 21:19.140\n that we don't yet understand\n\n21:19.140 --> 21:20.900\n because we haven't reverse engineered\n\n21:20.900 --> 21:22.340\n our own minds sufficiently.\n\n21:22.340 --> 21:23.900\n We don't know the expected rewards.\n\n21:23.900 --> 21:24.940\n We don't know the mechanism\n\n21:24.940 --> 21:27.180\n by which we estimate the rewards and so on.\n\n21:27.180 --> 21:28.300\n But there is an algorithm.\n\n21:28.300 --> 21:30.580\n We observe ourselves performing\n\n21:30.580 --> 21:34.820\n where we see that we weight facts and factors\n\n21:34.820 --> 21:39.300\n and the future, and then some kind of possibility,\n\n21:39.300 --> 21:41.620\n some motive gets raised to an intention.\n\n21:41.620 --> 21:44.500\n And that's informed bet that the system is making.\n\n21:44.500 --> 21:46.420\n And that making of the informed bet,\n\n21:46.420 --> 21:49.460\n the representation of that is what we call free will.\n\n21:49.460 --> 21:51.580\n And it seems to be paradoxical\n\n21:51.580 --> 21:53.700\n because we think that the crucial thing is\n\n21:53.700 --> 21:56.500\n about it that it's somehow indeterministic.\n\n21:56.500 --> 21:59.220\n And yet if it was indeterministic, it would be random.\n\n22:00.340 --> 22:03.380\n And it cannot be random because if it was random,\n\n22:03.380 --> 22:05.300\n if just dice were being thrown in the universe,\n\n22:05.300 --> 22:08.180\n randomly forces you to do things, it would be meaningless.\n\n22:08.180 --> 22:10.420\n So the important part of the decisions\n\n22:10.420 --> 22:12.700\n is always the deterministic stuff.\n\n22:12.700 --> 22:15.220\n But it appears to be indeterministic to you\n\n22:15.220 --> 22:16.820\n because it's unpredictable.\n\n22:16.820 --> 22:18.500\n Because if it was predictable,\n\n22:18.500 --> 22:21.460\n you wouldn't experience it as a free will decision.\n\n22:21.460 --> 22:23.260\n You would experience it as just doing\n\n22:23.260 --> 22:25.580\n the necessary right thing.\n\n22:25.580 --> 22:28.740\n And you see this continuum between the free will\n\n22:28.740 --> 22:31.740\n and the execution of automatic behavior\n\n22:31.740 --> 22:33.220\n when you're observing other people.\n\n22:33.220 --> 22:36.220\n So for instance, when you are observing your own children,\n\n22:36.220 --> 22:37.580\n if you don't understand them,\n\n22:37.580 --> 22:40.060\n you will abuse this agent model\n\n22:40.060 --> 22:43.260\n where you have an agent with a set point generator.\n\n22:43.260 --> 22:45.420\n And the agent is doing the best it can\n\n22:45.420 --> 22:47.420\n to minimize the difference to the set point.\n\n22:47.420 --> 22:51.220\n And it might be confused and sometimes impulsive or whatever,\n\n22:51.220 --> 22:53.340\n but it's acting on its own free will.\n\n22:53.340 --> 22:55.420\n And when you understand what's happens\n\n22:55.420 --> 22:58.540\n in the mind of the child, you see that it's automatic.\n\n22:58.540 --> 23:00.300\n And you can outmodel the child,\n\n23:00.300 --> 23:02.300\n you can build things around the child\n\n23:02.300 --> 23:05.260\n that will lead the child to making exactly the decision\n\n23:05.260 --> 23:06.740\n that you are predicting.\n\n23:06.740 --> 23:08.740\n And under these circumstances,\n\n23:08.740 --> 23:10.500\n like when you are a stage musician\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:13.420\n or somebody who is dealing with people\n\n23:13.420 --> 23:15.260\n that you sell a car to,\n\n23:15.260 --> 23:17.300\n and you completely understand the psychology\n\n23:17.300 --> 23:19.660\n and the impulses and the space of thoughts\n\n23:19.660 --> 23:21.580\n that this individual can have at that moment.\n\n23:21.580 --> 23:22.620\n Under these circumstances,\n\n23:22.620 --> 23:24.660\n it makes no sense to attribute free will.\n\n23:26.060 --> 23:28.220\n Because it's no longer decision making under uncertainty.\n\n23:28.220 --> 23:29.220\n You are already certain.\n\n23:29.220 --> 23:30.500\n For them, there's uncertainty,\n\n23:30.500 --> 23:32.460\n but you already know what they're doing.\n\n23:33.780 --> 23:34.980\n But what about for you?\n\n23:34.980 --> 23:39.980\n So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata\n\n23:40.500 --> 23:43.300\n where it's deterministic,\n\n23:43.300 --> 23:46.060\n but when you squint your eyes a little bit,\n\n23:46.940 --> 23:50.780\n it starts to look like there's agents making decisions\n\n23:50.780 --> 23:53.780\n at the higher sort of when you zoom out\n\n23:53.780 --> 23:55.020\n and look at the entities\n\n23:55.020 --> 23:58.460\n that are composed by the individual cells.\n\n23:58.460 --> 24:02.060\n Even though there's underlying simple rules\n\n24:02.060 --> 24:07.060\n that make the system evolve in deterministic ways,\n\n24:07.540 --> 24:10.780\n it looks like there's organisms making decisions.\n\n24:10.780 --> 24:14.500\n Is that where the illusion of free will emerges,\n\n24:14.500 --> 24:15.900\n that jump in scale?\n\n24:16.740 --> 24:18.500\n It's a particular type of model,\n\n24:18.500 --> 24:20.700\n but this jump in scale is crucial.\n\n24:20.700 --> 24:22.380\n The jump in scale happens whenever\n\n24:22.380 --> 24:23.820\n you have too many parts to count\n\n24:23.820 --> 24:25.780\n and you cannot make a model at that level\n\n24:25.780 --> 24:28.780\n and you try to find some higher level regularity.\n\n24:28.780 --> 24:30.900\n And the higher level regularity is a pattern\n\n24:30.900 --> 24:34.660\n that you project into the world to make sense of it.\n\n24:34.660 --> 24:36.460\n And agency is one of these patterns, right?\n\n24:36.460 --> 24:39.700\n You have all these cells that interact with each other\n\n24:39.700 --> 24:42.220\n and the cells in our body are set up in such a way\n\n24:42.220 --> 24:45.060\n that they benefit if their behavior is coherent,\n\n24:45.060 --> 24:46.580\n which means that they act\n\n24:46.580 --> 24:49.180\n as if they were serving a common goal.\n\n24:49.180 --> 24:52.340\n And that means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms\n\n24:52.340 --> 24:55.300\n that act as if they were serving a common goal.\n\n24:55.300 --> 24:57.620\n And now you can make sense of all these cells\n\n24:57.620 --> 24:59.900\n by projecting the common goal into them.\n\n24:59.900 --> 25:03.340\n Right, so for you then, free will is an illusion.\n\n25:03.340 --> 25:06.460\n No, it's a model and it's a construct.\n\n25:06.460 --> 25:08.580\n It's basically a model that the system is making\n\n25:08.580 --> 25:09.420\n of its own behavior.\n\n25:09.420 --> 25:11.500\n And it's the best model that it can come up with\n\n25:11.500 --> 25:12.740\n under the circumstances.\n\n25:12.740 --> 25:14.740\n And it can get replaced by a different model,\n\n25:14.740 --> 25:16.420\n which is automatic behavior,\n\n25:16.420 --> 25:17.980\n when you fully understand the mechanism\n\n25:17.980 --> 25:19.180\n under which you are acting.\n\n25:19.180 --> 25:23.860\n Yeah, but another word for model is what, story.\n\n25:23.860 --> 25:25.300\n So it's the story you're telling.\n\n25:25.300 --> 25:27.340\n I mean, do you actually have control?\n\n25:27.340 --> 25:29.420\n Is there such a thing as a you\n\n25:29.420 --> 25:33.980\n and is there such a thing as you have in control?\n\n25:33.980 --> 25:38.980\n So like, are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?\n\n25:42.020 --> 25:44.380\n In some sense, the you is the model of the system\n\n25:44.380 --> 25:45.660\n that is in control.\n\n25:45.660 --> 25:47.860\n It's a story that the system tells itself\n\n25:47.860 --> 25:50.340\n about somebody who is in control.\n\n25:50.340 --> 25:51.180\n Yeah.\n\n25:51.180 --> 25:53.060\n And the contents of that model are being used\n\n25:53.060 --> 25:54.940\n to inform the behavior of the system.\n\n25:56.940 --> 25:57.780\n Okay.\n\n25:57.780 --> 26:00.500\n So the system is completely mechanical\n\n26:00.500 --> 26:03.300\n and the system creates that story like a loom.\n\n26:03.300 --> 26:06.020\n And then it uses the contents of that story\n\n26:06.020 --> 26:07.460\n to inform its actions\n\n26:07.460 --> 26:11.220\n and writes the results of that actions into the story.\n\n26:11.220 --> 26:13.380\n So how's that not an illusion?\n\n26:13.380 --> 26:16.220\n The story is written then,\n\n26:16.220 --> 26:19.780\n or rather we're not the writers of the story.\n\n26:21.260 --> 26:22.780\n Yes, but we always knew that.\n\n26:24.060 --> 26:25.300\n No, we don't know that.\n\n26:25.300 --> 26:26.740\n When did we know that?\n\n26:26.740 --> 26:29.260\n I think that's mostly a confusion about concepts.\n\n26:29.260 --> 26:31.980\n The conceptual illusion in our culture\n\n26:31.980 --> 26:35.700\n comes from the idea that we live in physical reality\n\n26:35.700 --> 26:37.460\n and that we experience physical reality\n\n26:37.460 --> 26:39.500\n and that you have ideas about it.\n\n26:39.500 --> 26:41.660\n And then you have this dualist interpretation\n\n26:41.660 --> 26:45.060\n where you have two substances, res extensa,\n\n26:45.060 --> 26:46.940\n the world that you can touch\n\n26:46.940 --> 26:48.980\n and that is made of extended things\n\n26:48.980 --> 26:51.620\n and res cogitans, which is the world of ideas.\n\n26:51.620 --> 26:54.580\n And in fact, both of them are mental representations.\n\n26:54.580 --> 26:57.900\n One is the representations of the world as a game engine\n\n26:57.900 --> 27:01.100\n that your mind generates to make sense of the perceptual data.\n\n27:01.100 --> 27:02.260\n And the other one,\n\n27:02.260 --> 27:04.460\n yes, that's what we perceive as the physical world.\n\n27:04.460 --> 27:05.940\n But we already know that the physical world\n\n27:05.940 --> 27:07.020\n is nothing like that, right?\n\n27:07.020 --> 27:08.860\n Quantum mechanics is very different\n\n27:08.860 --> 27:11.340\n from what you and me perceive as the world.\n\n27:11.340 --> 27:14.820\n The world that you and me perceive as a game engine.\n\n27:14.820 --> 27:17.180\n And there are no colors and sounds in the physical world.\n\n27:17.180 --> 27:20.100\n They only exist in the game engine generated by your brain.\n\n27:20.100 --> 27:21.500\n And then you have ideas\n\n27:21.500 --> 27:24.740\n that cannot be mapped onto extended regions, right?\n\n27:24.740 --> 27:26.940\n So the objects that have a spatial extension\n\n27:26.940 --> 27:29.500\n in the game engine, res extensa,\n\n27:29.500 --> 27:31.460\n and the objects that don't have a physical extension\n\n27:31.460 --> 27:34.540\n in the game engine are ideas.\n\n27:34.540 --> 27:36.140\n And they both interact in our mind\n\n27:36.140 --> 27:38.220\n to produce models of the world.\n\n27:38.220 --> 27:41.740\n Yep, but, you know, when you play video games,\n\n27:42.780 --> 27:45.020\n I understand that what's actually happening\n\n27:45.020 --> 27:50.020\n is zeros and ones inside of a computer,\n\n27:50.020 --> 27:52.820\n inside of a CPU and a GPU,\n\n27:52.820 --> 27:57.820\n but you're still seeing like the rendering of that.\n\n27:58.140 --> 28:00.700\n And you're still making decisions,\n\n28:00.700 --> 28:03.740\n whether to shoot, to turn left or to turn right,\n\n28:03.740 --> 28:04.660\n if you're playing a shooter,\n\n28:04.660 --> 28:07.100\n or every time I started thinking about Skyrim\n\n28:07.100 --> 28:09.860\n and Elder Scrolls and walking around in beautiful nature\n\n28:09.860 --> 28:10.900\n and swinging a sword.\n\n28:10.900 --> 28:13.100\n But it feels like you're making decisions\n\n28:13.100 --> 28:15.060\n inside that video game.\n\n28:15.060 --> 28:17.220\n So even though you don't have direct access\n\n28:17.220 --> 28:21.220\n in terms of perception to the bits,\n\n28:21.220 --> 28:22.660\n to the zeros and ones,\n\n28:22.660 --> 28:24.860\n it still feels like you're making decisions\n\n28:24.860 --> 28:27.900\n and your decisions actually feels\n\n28:27.900 --> 28:30.740\n like they're being applied all the way down\n\n28:30.740 --> 28:32.300\n to the zeros and ones.\n\n28:32.300 --> 28:33.460\n So it feels like you have control,\n\n28:33.460 --> 28:36.540\n even though you don't have direct access to reality.\n\n28:36.540 --> 28:38.780\n So there is basically a special character\n\n28:38.780 --> 28:40.420\n in the video game that is being created\n\n28:40.420 --> 28:42.100\n by the video game engine.\n\n28:42.100 --> 28:43.820\n And this character is serving the aesthetics\n\n28:43.820 --> 28:47.060\n of the video game, and that is you.\n\n28:47.060 --> 28:50.900\n Yes, but I feel like I have control inside the video game.\n\n28:50.900 --> 28:53.060\n Like all those like 12 year olds\n\n28:53.060 --> 28:55.420\n that kick my ass on the internet.\n\n28:55.420 --> 28:57.700\n So when you play the video game,\n\n28:57.700 --> 28:59.900\n it doesn't really matter that there's zeros and ones, right?\n\n28:59.900 --> 29:01.700\n You don't care about the bits of the past.\n\n29:01.700 --> 29:03.540\n You don't care about the nature of the CPU\n\n29:03.540 --> 29:04.460\n that it runs on.\n\n29:04.460 --> 29:06.700\n What you care about are the properties of the game\n\n29:06.700 --> 29:07.780\n that you're playing.\n\n29:07.780 --> 29:10.060\n And you hope that the CPU is good enough.\n\n29:10.060 --> 29:10.900\n Yes.\n\n29:10.900 --> 29:13.300\n And a similar thing happens when we interact with physics.\n\n29:13.300 --> 29:15.980\n The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.\n\n29:15.980 --> 29:18.420\n The world that you and me are in is a dream world.\n\n29:19.580 --> 29:21.660\n How close is it to the real world though?\n\n29:23.420 --> 29:25.020\n We know that it's not very close,\n\n29:25.020 --> 29:27.500\n but we know that the dynamics of the dream world\n\n29:27.500 --> 29:29.300\n match the dynamics of the physical world\n\n29:29.300 --> 29:31.060\n to a certain degree of resolution.\n\n29:31.060 --> 29:33.860\n But the causal structure of the dream world is different.\n\n29:35.220 --> 29:38.180\n So you see for instance waves crashing on your feet, right?\n\n29:38.180 --> 29:39.420\n But there are no waves in the ocean.\n\n29:39.420 --> 29:42.420\n There's only water molecules that have tangents\n\n29:42.420 --> 29:47.340\n between the molecules that are the result of electrons\n\n29:47.340 --> 29:50.060\n in the molecules interacting with each other.\n\n29:50.060 --> 29:52.140\n Aren't they like very consistent?\n\n29:52.140 --> 29:55.700\n We're just seeing a very crude approximation.\n\n29:55.700 --> 29:59.340\n Isn't our dream world very consistent,\n\n29:59.340 --> 30:02.980\n like to the point of being mapped directly one to one\n\n30:02.980 --> 30:04.260\n to the actual physical world\n\n30:04.260 --> 30:07.660\n as opposed to us being completely tricked?\n\n30:07.660 --> 30:09.220\n Is this is like where you have like Donald?\n\n30:09.220 --> 30:10.060\n It's not a trick.\n\n30:10.060 --> 30:10.900\n That's my point.\n\n30:10.900 --> 30:11.860\n It's not an illusion.\n\n30:11.860 --> 30:13.700\n It's a form of data compression.\n\n30:13.700 --> 30:15.420\n It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics\n\n30:15.420 --> 30:16.940\n of too many parts to count\n\n30:16.940 --> 30:18.700\n at the level at which we are entangled\n\n30:18.700 --> 30:20.740\n with the best model that you can find.\n\n30:20.740 --> 30:22.700\n Yeah, so we can act in that dream world\n\n30:22.700 --> 30:26.140\n and our actions have impact in the real world,\n\n30:26.140 --> 30:28.620\n in the physical world to which we don't have access.\n\n30:28.620 --> 30:31.860\n Yes, but it's basically like accepting the fact\n\n30:31.860 --> 30:33.180\n that the software that we live in,\n\n30:33.180 --> 30:35.380\n the dream that we live in is generated\n\n30:35.380 --> 30:38.060\n by something outside of this world that you and me are in.\n\n30:38.060 --> 30:40.060\n So is the software deterministic\n\n30:40.060 --> 30:42.260\n and do we not have any control?\n\n30:42.260 --> 30:47.260\n Do we have, so free will is having a conscious being.\n\n30:49.620 --> 30:52.860\n Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.\n\n30:55.300 --> 30:58.060\n No, it's slightly different.\n\n30:58.060 --> 31:00.540\n Basically in the same way as you are modeling\n\n31:00.540 --> 31:03.460\n the water molecules in the ocean that engulf your feet\n\n31:03.460 --> 31:05.980\n when you are walking on the beach as waves\n\n31:05.980 --> 31:07.380\n and there are no waves,\n\n31:07.380 --> 31:09.780\n but only the atoms on more complicated stuff\n\n31:09.780 --> 31:11.820\n underneath the atoms and so on.\n\n31:11.820 --> 31:13.020\n And you know that, right?\n\n31:14.020 --> 31:15.300\n You would accept, yes,\n\n31:15.300 --> 31:17.660\n there is a certain abstraction that happens here.\n\n31:17.660 --> 31:19.420\n It's a simplification of what happens\n\n31:19.420 --> 31:22.100\n and the simplification that is designed\n\n31:22.100 --> 31:24.260\n in such a way that your brain can deal with it,\n\n31:24.260 --> 31:27.020\n temporarily and spatially in terms of resources\n\n31:27.020 --> 31:28.740\n and tuned for the predictive value.\n\n31:28.740 --> 31:31.220\n So you can predict with some accuracy\n\n31:31.220 --> 31:33.380\n whether your feet are going to get wet or not.\n\n31:33.380 --> 31:37.620\n But it's a really good interface and approximation.\n\n31:37.620 --> 31:40.340\n It says E equals MC squared is a good,\n\n31:40.340 --> 31:43.100\n equations are good approximation for,\n\n31:43.100 --> 31:44.780\n they're much better approximation.\n\n31:45.780 --> 31:49.380\n So to me, waves is a really nice approximation\n\n31:49.380 --> 31:51.940\n of what's all the complexity that's happening underneath.\n\n31:51.940 --> 31:53.140\n Basically it's a machine learning model\n\n31:53.140 --> 31:55.580\n that is constantly tuned to minimize surprises.\n\n31:55.580 --> 31:58.540\n So it basically tries to predict as well as it can\n\n31:58.540 --> 31:59.780\n what you're going to perceive next.\n\n31:59.780 --> 32:02.620\n Are we talking about, which is the machine learning?\n\n32:02.620 --> 32:05.700\n Our perception system or the dream world?\n\n32:05.700 --> 32:08.260\n The machine world, dream world is the result\n\n32:08.260 --> 32:11.180\n of the machine learning process of the perceptual system.\n\n32:11.180 --> 32:12.220\n That's doing the compression.\n\n32:12.220 --> 32:13.060\n Yes.\n\n32:13.060 --> 32:15.860\n And the model of you as an agent\n\n32:15.860 --> 32:19.460\n is not a different type of model or it's a different type,\n\n32:19.460 --> 32:23.180\n but not different as in its model like nature\n\n32:23.180 --> 32:25.540\n from the model of the ocean, right?\n\n32:25.540 --> 32:28.260\n Some things are oceans, some things are agents.\n\n32:28.260 --> 32:31.620\n And one of these agents is using your own control model,\n\n32:31.620 --> 32:32.780\n the output of your model,\n\n32:32.780 --> 32:36.260\n the things that you perceive yourself as doing.\n\n32:36.260 --> 32:38.180\n And that is you.\n\n32:38.180 --> 32:42.020\n What about the fact that when you're standing\n\n32:44.100 --> 32:47.340\n with the water on your feet and you're looking out\n\n32:47.340 --> 32:51.980\n into the vast open water of the ocean\n\n32:51.980 --> 32:54.460\n and then there's a beautiful sunset\n\n32:54.460 --> 32:56.540\n and the fact that it's beautiful\n\n32:56.540 --> 32:59.180\n and then maybe you have friends or a loved one with you\n\n32:59.180 --> 33:00.900\n and you feel love, what is that?\n\n33:00.900 --> 33:02.700\n As the dream world or what is that?\n\n33:02.700 --> 33:05.620\n Yes, it's all happening inside of the dream.\n\n33:05.620 --> 33:06.860\n Okay.\n\n33:06.860 --> 33:11.380\n But see, the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.\n\n33:11.380 --> 33:12.780\n No, of course it's not real.\n\n33:14.940 --> 33:16.540\n The physical universe is real,\n\n33:16.540 --> 33:18.620\n but the physical universe is incomprehensible\n\n33:18.620 --> 33:21.060\n and it doesn't have any feeling of realness.\n\n33:21.060 --> 33:22.900\n The feeling of realness that you experience\n\n33:22.900 --> 33:25.420\n gets attached to certain representations\n\n33:25.420 --> 33:26.620\n where your brain assesses,\n\n33:26.620 --> 33:28.500\n this is the best model of reality that I have.\n\n33:28.500 --> 33:30.820\n So the only thing that's real to you\n\n33:30.820 --> 33:34.740\n is the thing that's happening at the very base of reality.\n\n33:34.740 --> 33:39.020\n Yeah, for something to be real, it needs to be implemented.\n\n33:40.020 --> 33:42.340\n So the model that you have of reality\n\n33:42.340 --> 33:45.300\n is real in as far as it is a model.\n\n33:45.300 --> 33:47.860\n It's an appropriate description of the world\n\n33:47.860 --> 33:51.500\n to say that there are models that are being experienced,\n\n33:51.500 --> 33:54.700\n but the world that you experience\n\n33:54.700 --> 33:56.900\n is not necessarily implemented.\n\n33:56.900 --> 33:59.380\n There is a difference between a reality,\n\n33:59.380 --> 34:01.260\n a simulation and a simulacrum.\n\n34:02.220 --> 34:04.460\n The reality that we're talking about\n\n34:04.460 --> 34:06.060\n is something that fully emerges\n\n34:06.060 --> 34:08.620\n over a causally closed lowest layer.\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:11.300\n And the idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer,\n\n34:11.300 --> 34:13.460\n that basically our world emerges over that.\n\n34:13.460 --> 34:16.060\n Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory,\n\n34:16.060 --> 34:17.980\n which basically says that we are\n\n34:17.980 --> 34:19.460\n in some kind of simulation universe\n\n34:19.460 --> 34:22.100\n and the real world needs to be in a parent universe of that,\n\n34:22.100 --> 34:24.380\n where the actual causal structure is, right?\n\n34:24.380 --> 34:27.660\n And when you look at the ocean and your own mind,\n\n34:27.660 --> 34:28.900\n you are looking at a simulation\n\n34:28.900 --> 34:31.460\n that explains what you're going to see next.\n\n34:31.460 --> 34:32.860\n So we are living in a simulation.\n\n34:32.860 --> 34:35.900\n Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.\n\n34:35.900 --> 34:36.740\n Yeah.\n\n34:36.740 --> 34:39.660\n And this simulation is different from the physical reality\n\n34:39.660 --> 34:42.060\n because the causal structure that is being produced,\n\n34:42.060 --> 34:43.380\n what you are seeing is different\n\n34:43.380 --> 34:44.980\n from the causal structure of physics.\n\n34:44.980 --> 34:45.900\n But consistent.\n\n34:46.780 --> 34:49.780\n Hopefully, if not, then you are going to end up\n\n34:49.780 --> 34:51.060\n in some kind of institution\n\n34:51.060 --> 34:52.220\n where people will take care of you\n\n34:52.220 --> 34:54.580\n because your behavior will be inconsistent, right?\n\n34:54.580 --> 34:57.220\n Your behavior needs to work in such a way\n\n34:57.220 --> 35:00.140\n that it's interacting with an accurately predictive\n\n35:00.140 --> 35:00.980\n model of reality.\n\n35:00.980 --> 35:03.500\n And if your brain is unable to make your model\n\n35:03.500 --> 35:06.180\n of reality predictive, you will need help.\n\n35:06.180 --> 35:10.260\n So what do you think about Donald Hoffman's argument\n\n35:10.260 --> 35:12.740\n that it doesn't have to be consistent,\n\n35:12.740 --> 35:16.820\n the dream world to what he calls like the interface\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:19.500\n to the actual physical reality,\n\n35:19.500 --> 35:20.660\n where there could be evolution?\n\n35:20.660 --> 35:23.060\n I think he makes an evolutionary argument,\n\n35:23.060 --> 35:26.460\n which is like, it could be an evolutionary advantage\n\n35:26.460 --> 35:30.940\n to have the dream world drift away from physical reality.\n\n35:30.940 --> 35:32.780\n I think that only works if you have tenure.\n\n35:32.780 --> 35:35.260\n As long as you're still interacting with the ground tools,\n\n35:35.260 --> 35:37.580\n your model needs to be somewhat predictive.\n\n35:38.980 --> 35:42.740\n Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure\n\n35:42.740 --> 35:43.900\n in the animal kingdom.\n\n35:45.100 --> 35:45.940\n Yeah.\n\n35:45.940 --> 35:47.620\n And at some point we became too big to fail,\n\n35:47.620 --> 35:49.300\n so we became postmodernist.\n\n35:51.420 --> 35:52.660\n It all makes sense now.\n\n35:52.660 --> 35:54.980\n We can just change the version of reality that we like.\n\n35:54.980 --> 35:56.500\n Oh man.\n\n35:56.500 --> 35:57.380\n Okay.\n\n35:57.380 --> 36:00.220\n Yeah, but basically you can do magic.\n\n36:00.220 --> 36:02.460\n You can change your assessment of reality,\n\n36:02.460 --> 36:05.580\n but eventually reality is going to come bite you in the ass\n\n36:05.580 --> 36:06.820\n if it's not predictive.\n\n36:06.820 --> 36:11.220\n Do you have a sense of what is that base layer\n\n36:11.220 --> 36:12.580\n of physical reality?\n\n36:12.580 --> 36:15.540\n You have like, so you have these attempts\n\n36:15.540 --> 36:17.620\n at the theories of everything,\n\n36:17.620 --> 36:21.140\n the very, very small of like strength theory,\n\n36:21.140 --> 36:25.420\n or what Stephen Wolfram talks about with the hyper grass.\n\n36:25.420 --> 36:28.540\n These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects.\n\n36:28.540 --> 36:31.660\n And then there is more like quantum mechanics\n\n36:32.620 --> 36:34.900\n that's talking about objects that are much larger,\n\n36:34.900 --> 36:36.780\n but still very, very, very tiny.\n\n36:36.780 --> 36:40.060\n Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is\n\n36:40.060 --> 36:42.900\n that is like at the lowest level?\n\n36:42.900 --> 36:44.740\n The turtle at the very bottom.\n\n36:44.740 --> 36:45.980\n Do you have a sense what that turtle is?\n\n36:45.980 --> 36:48.580\n I don't think that you can talk about where it is\n\n36:48.580 --> 36:51.580\n because space is emerging over the activity of these things.\n\n36:51.580 --> 36:55.540\n So space, the coordinates only exist\n\n36:55.540 --> 36:58.820\n in relation to the things, other things.\n\n36:58.820 --> 37:01.740\n And so you could, in some sense, abstract it into locations\n\n37:01.740 --> 37:04.300\n that can hold information and trajectories\n\n37:04.300 --> 37:05.540\n that the information can take\n\n37:05.540 --> 37:06.860\n between the different locations.\n\n37:06.860 --> 37:10.380\n And this is how we construct our notion of space.\n\n37:10.380 --> 37:14.100\n And physicists usually have a notion of space\n\n37:14.100 --> 37:15.700\n that is continuous.\n\n37:15.700 --> 37:19.140\n And this is a point where I tend to agree\n\n37:19.140 --> 37:20.980\n with people like Stephen Wolfram\n\n37:20.980 --> 37:23.820\n who are very skeptical of the geometric notions.\n\n37:23.820 --> 37:25.980\n I think that geometry is the dynamics\n\n37:25.980 --> 37:27.300\n of too many parts to count.\n\n37:27.300 --> 37:30.820\n And when there are no infinities,\n\n37:30.820 --> 37:32.500\n if there were two infinities,\n\n37:32.500 --> 37:34.220\n you would be running into contradictions,\n\n37:34.220 --> 37:37.780\n which is in some sense what G\u00f6del and Turing discovered\n\n37:37.780 --> 37:39.820\n in response to Hilbert's call.\n\n37:39.820 --> 37:41.340\n So there are no infinities.\n\n37:41.340 --> 37:42.180\n There are no infinities.\n\n37:42.180 --> 37:43.020\n Infinities fake.\n\n37:43.020 --> 37:45.300\n There is unboundedness, but if you have a language\n\n37:45.300 --> 37:47.340\n that talks about infinity, at some point,\n\n37:47.340 --> 37:49.580\n the language is going to contradict itself,\n\n37:49.580 --> 37:51.660\n which means it's no longer valid.\n\n37:51.660 --> 37:54.020\n In order to deal with infinities and mathematics,\n\n37:54.020 --> 37:57.580\n you have to postulate the existence initially.\n\n37:57.580 --> 37:59.180\n You cannot construct the infinities.\n\n37:59.180 --> 38:00.180\n And that's an issue, right?\n\n38:00.180 --> 38:02.700\n You cannot build up an infinity from zero.\n\n38:02.700 --> 38:04.700\n But in practice, you never do this, right?\n\n38:04.700 --> 38:06.020\n When you perform calculations,\n\n38:06.020 --> 38:09.060\n you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count.\n\n38:09.060 --> 38:13.420\n And usually these numbers are not that large.\n\n38:13.420 --> 38:14.860\n They're not Googles or something.\n\n38:14.860 --> 38:18.540\n The infinities that we are dealing with in our universe\n\n38:18.540 --> 38:22.340\n are mathematically speaking, relatively small integers.\n\n38:23.180 --> 38:26.540\n And still what we're looking at is dynamics\n\n38:26.540 --> 38:30.660\n where a trillion things behave similar\n\n38:30.660 --> 38:32.660\n to a hundred trillion things\n\n38:32.660 --> 38:37.660\n or something that is very, very large\n\n38:37.860 --> 38:39.260\n because they're converging.\n\n38:39.260 --> 38:41.380\n And these convergent dynamics, these operators,\n\n38:41.380 --> 38:45.020\n this is what we deal with when we are doing the geometry.\n\n38:45.020 --> 38:48.420\n Geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it's continuous\n\n38:48.420 --> 38:53.100\n because if we subdivide the space sufficiently fine grained,\n\n38:54.100 --> 38:56.140\n these things approach a certain dynamic.\n\n38:56.140 --> 38:59.220\n And this approach dynamic, that is what we mean by it.\n\n38:59.220 --> 39:02.860\n But I don't think that infinity would work, so to speak,\n\n39:02.860 --> 39:05.060\n that you would know the last digit of pi\n\n39:05.060 --> 39:06.540\n and that you have a physical process\n\n39:06.540 --> 39:09.420\n that rests on knowing the last digit of pi.\n\n39:09.420 --> 39:12.020\n Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk\n\n39:12.020 --> 39:15.100\n of human cognition that we like discrete.\n\n39:15.100 --> 39:16.660\n Discrete makes sense to us.\n\n39:16.660 --> 39:19.900\n Infinity doesn't, so in terms of our intuitions.\n\n39:19.900 --> 39:22.940\n No, the issue is that everything that we think about\n\n39:22.940 --> 39:25.660\n needs to be expressed in some kind of mental language,\n\n39:25.660 --> 39:27.740\n not necessarily natural language,\n\n39:27.740 --> 39:29.860\n but some kind of mathematical language\n\n39:29.860 --> 39:31.700\n that your neurons can speak\n\n39:31.700 --> 39:34.140\n that refers to something in the world.\n\n39:34.140 --> 39:35.460\n And what we have discovered\n\n39:35.460 --> 39:39.020\n is that we cannot construct a notion of infinity\n\n39:39.020 --> 39:40.540\n without running into contradictions,\n\n39:40.540 --> 39:43.620\n which means that such a language is no longer valid.\n\n39:43.620 --> 39:46.780\n And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy\n\n39:46.780 --> 39:49.380\n when somebody came up with the notion of irrational numbers\n\n39:49.380 --> 39:50.420\n before it was time, right?\n\n39:50.420 --> 39:52.700\n There's this myth that he had this person killed\n\n39:52.700 --> 39:54.140\n when he blabbed out the secret\n\n39:54.140 --> 39:55.740\n that not everything can be expressed\n\n39:55.740 --> 39:57.300\n as a ratio between two numbers,\n\n39:57.300 --> 39:59.740\n but there are numbers between the ratios.\n\n39:59.740 --> 40:01.060\n The world was not ready for this.\n\n40:01.060 --> 40:02.380\n And I think he was right.\n\n40:02.380 --> 40:06.060\n That has confused mathematicians very seriously\n\n40:06.060 --> 40:09.660\n because these numbers are not values, they are functions.\n\n40:09.660 --> 40:11.580\n And so you can calculate these functions\n\n40:11.580 --> 40:13.260\n to a certain degree of approximation,\n\n40:13.260 --> 40:17.060\n but you cannot pretend that pi has actually a value.\n\n40:17.060 --> 40:20.020\n Pi is a function that would approach this value\n\n40:20.020 --> 40:21.500\n to some degree,\n\n40:21.500 --> 40:23.780\n but nothing in the world rests on knowing pi.\n\n40:26.980 --> 40:28.620\n How important is this distinction\n\n40:28.620 --> 40:32.180\n between discrete and continuous for you to get to the book?\n\n40:32.180 --> 40:36.580\n Because there's a, I mean, in discussion of your favorite\n\n40:36.580 --> 40:39.180\n flavor of the theory of everything,\n\n40:39.180 --> 40:41.140\n there's a few on the table.\n\n40:41.140 --> 40:44.420\n So there's string theory, there's a particular,\n\n40:45.260 --> 40:48.180\n there's a little quantum gravity,\n\n40:48.180 --> 40:51.660\n which focused on one particular unification.\n\n40:53.180 --> 40:56.140\n There's just a bunch of favorite flavors\n\n40:56.140 --> 40:59.460\n of different people trying to propose\n\n40:59.460 --> 41:01.260\n a theory of everything.\n\n41:01.260 --> 41:04.780\n Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people throughout history.\n\n41:04.780 --> 41:06.660\n And then of course, Stephen Wolfram,\n\n41:06.660 --> 41:10.860\n who I think is one of the only people doing a discrete.\n\n41:10.860 --> 41:12.580\n No, no, there's a bunch of physicists\n\n41:12.580 --> 41:13.700\n who do this right now.\n\n41:13.700 --> 41:17.660\n And like Toffoli and Tomasello.\n\n41:17.660 --> 41:21.940\n And digital physics is something\n\n41:21.940 --> 41:24.460\n that is, I think, growing in popularity.\n\n41:24.460 --> 41:29.460\n But the main reason why this is interesting\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:34.460\n is because it's important sometimes to settle disagreements.\n\n41:34.700 --> 41:36.980\n I don't think that you need infinities at all,\n\n41:36.980 --> 41:38.940\n and you never needed them.\n\n41:38.940 --> 41:40.900\n You can always deal with very large numbers\n\n41:40.900 --> 41:42.260\n and you can deal with limits, right?\n\n41:42.260 --> 41:43.780\n We are fine with doing that.\n\n41:43.780 --> 41:45.300\n You don't need any kind of infinity.\n\n41:45.300 --> 41:48.340\n You can build your computer algebra systems just as well\n\n41:48.340 --> 41:50.300\n without believing in infinity in the first place.\n\n41:50.300 --> 41:51.940\n So you're okay with limits?\n\n41:51.940 --> 41:54.420\n Yeah, so basically a limit means that something\n\n41:54.420 --> 41:57.460\n is behaving pretty much the same\n\n41:57.460 --> 41:59.100\n if you make the number large.\n\n41:59.100 --> 42:02.420\n Right, because it's converging to a certain value.\n\n42:02.420 --> 42:04.780\n And at some point the difference becomes negligible\n\n42:04.780 --> 42:06.620\n and you can no longer measure it.\n\n42:06.620 --> 42:08.660\n And in this sense, you have things\n\n42:08.660 --> 42:12.820\n that if you have an ngon which has enough corners,\n\n42:12.820 --> 42:15.180\n then it's going to behave like a circle at some point, right?\n\n42:15.180 --> 42:18.380\n And it's only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing\n\n42:18.380 --> 42:21.060\n that cannot exist in the physical universe\n\n42:21.060 --> 42:23.820\n that you would be talking about this perfect circle.\n\n42:23.820 --> 42:25.900\n And now it turns out that it also wouldn't work\n\n42:25.900 --> 42:28.380\n in mathematics because you cannot construct mathematics\n\n42:28.380 --> 42:30.020\n that has infinite resolution\n\n42:30.020 --> 42:31.820\n without running into contradictions.\n\n42:32.820 --> 42:35.020\n So that is itself not that important\n\n42:35.020 --> 42:36.220\n because we never did that, right?\n\n42:36.220 --> 42:39.020\n It's just a thing that some people thought we could.\n\n42:39.020 --> 42:40.780\n And this leads to confusion.\n\n42:40.780 --> 42:43.580\n So for instance, Roger Penrose uses this as an argument\n\n42:43.580 --> 42:46.140\n to say that there are certain things\n\n42:46.140 --> 42:50.580\n that mathematicians can do dealing with infinities\n\n42:50.580 --> 42:53.220\n and by extension our mind can do\n\n42:53.220 --> 42:55.180\n that computers cannot do.\n\n42:55.180 --> 42:58.420\n Yeah, he talks about that the human mind\n\n42:58.420 --> 43:00.780\n can do certain mathematical things\n\n43:00.780 --> 43:02.900\n that the computer as defined\n\n43:02.900 --> 43:06.140\n by the universal Turing machine cannot.\n\n43:06.140 --> 43:07.180\n Yes.\n\n43:07.180 --> 43:08.900\n So that it has to do with infinity.\n\n43:08.900 --> 43:10.260\n Yes, it's one of the things.\n\n43:10.260 --> 43:13.100\n So he is basically pointing at the fact\n\n43:13.100 --> 43:15.580\n that there are things that are possible\n\n43:15.580 --> 43:20.580\n in the mathematical mind and in pure mathematics\n\n43:21.420 --> 43:24.100\n that are not possible in machines\n\n43:24.100 --> 43:27.060\n that can be constructed in the physical universe.\n\n43:27.060 --> 43:29.140\n And because he's an honest guy,\n\n43:29.140 --> 43:31.660\n he thinks this means that present physics\n\n43:31.660 --> 43:34.860\n cannot explain operations that happen in our mind.\n\n43:34.860 --> 43:35.780\n Do you think he's right?\n\n43:35.780 --> 43:38.700\n And so let's leave his discussion\n\n43:38.700 --> 43:40.780\n of consciousness aside for the moment.\n\n43:40.780 --> 43:42.780\n Do you think he's right about just\n\n43:42.780 --> 43:46.060\n what he's basically referring to as intelligence?\n\n43:46.060 --> 43:50.780\n So is the human mind fundamentally more capable\n\n43:50.780 --> 43:53.940\n as a thinking machine than a universal Turing machine?\n\n43:53.940 --> 43:55.460\n No.\n\n43:55.460 --> 43:58.740\n But so he's suggesting that, right?\n\n43:58.740 --> 44:01.020\n So our mind is actually less than a Turing machine.\n\n44:01.020 --> 44:02.100\n There can be no Turing machine\n\n44:02.100 --> 44:05.100\n because it's defined as having an infinite tape.\n\n44:05.100 --> 44:07.260\n And we always only have a finite tape.\n\n44:07.260 --> 44:08.100\n But he's saying it's better.\n\n44:08.100 --> 44:10.140\n Our minds can only perform finitely many operations.\n\n44:10.140 --> 44:10.980\n Yes, he thinks so.\n\n44:10.980 --> 44:13.100\n He's saying it can do the kind of computation\n\n44:13.100 --> 44:14.620\n that the Turing machine cannot.\n\n44:14.620 --> 44:16.660\n And that's because he thinks that our minds\n\n44:16.660 --> 44:19.500\n can do operations that have infinite resolution\n\n44:19.500 --> 44:21.020\n in some sense.\n\n44:21.020 --> 44:23.260\n And I don't think that's the case.\n\n44:23.260 --> 44:26.340\n Our minds are just able to discover these limit operators\n\n44:26.340 --> 44:27.700\n over too many parts to count.\n\n44:27.700 --> 44:28.540\n I see.\n\n44:30.300 --> 44:32.740\n What about his idea that consciousness\n\n44:32.740 --> 44:37.460\n is more than a computation?\n\n44:37.460 --> 44:42.100\n So it's more than something that a Turing machine can do.\n\n44:42.100 --> 44:44.540\n So again, saying that there's something special\n\n44:44.540 --> 44:47.780\n about our mind that cannot be replicated in a machine.\n\n44:49.820 --> 44:51.380\n The issue is that I don't even know\n\n44:51.380 --> 44:54.300\n how to construct a language to express\n\n44:54.300 --> 44:56.420\n this statement correctly.\n\n44:56.420 --> 44:57.260\n Well,\n\n45:01.100 --> 45:06.100\n the basic statement is there's a human experience\n\n45:06.900 --> 45:09.420\n that includes intelligence, that includes self awareness,\n\n45:09.420 --> 45:12.980\n that includes the hard problem of consciousness.\n\n45:12.980 --> 45:16.860\n And the question is, can that be fully simulated\n\n45:16.860 --> 45:20.940\n in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer\n\n45:20.940 --> 45:22.300\n as we understand it today?\n\n45:23.620 --> 45:25.900\n Roger Penrose says no.\n\n45:25.900 --> 45:30.220\n So the universe of Turing machine\n\n45:30.220 --> 45:32.460\n cannot simulate the universe.\n\n45:32.460 --> 45:34.420\n So the interesting question is,\n\n45:34.420 --> 45:36.500\n and you have to ask him this is, why not?\n\n45:36.500 --> 45:39.900\n What is this specific thing that cannot be modeled?\n\n45:39.900 --> 45:42.340\n And when I looked at his writings\n\n45:42.340 --> 45:43.540\n and I haven't read all of it,\n\n45:43.540 --> 45:45.940\n but when I read, for instance,\n\n45:45.940 --> 45:49.060\n the section that he writes in the introduction\n\n45:49.060 --> 45:51.020\n to a road to infinity,\n\n45:51.020 --> 45:53.260\n the thing that he specifically refers to\n\n45:53.260 --> 45:56.620\n is the way in which human minds deal with infinities.\n\n45:57.660 --> 46:02.020\n And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed.\n\n46:03.060 --> 46:05.580\n A lot of people feel that our experience\n\n46:05.580 --> 46:07.700\n cannot be explained in a mechanical way.\n\n46:08.660 --> 46:11.060\n And therefore it needs to be different.\n\n46:11.060 --> 46:14.500\n And I concur, our experience is not mechanical.\n\n46:14.500 --> 46:16.700\n Our experience is simulated.\n\n46:16.700 --> 46:18.420\n It exists only in a simulation.\n\n46:18.420 --> 46:19.980\n The only simulation can be conscious.\n\n46:19.980 --> 46:21.580\n Physical systems cannot be conscious\n\n46:21.580 --> 46:23.020\n because they're only mechanical.\n\n46:23.020 --> 46:25.100\n Cells cannot be conscious.\n\n46:25.100 --> 46:26.300\n Neurons cannot be conscious.\n\n46:26.300 --> 46:27.460\n Brains cannot be conscious.\n\n46:27.460 --> 46:28.660\n People cannot be conscious\n\n46:28.660 --> 46:31.620\n as far as if you understand them as physical systems.\n\n46:31.620 --> 46:36.220\n What can be conscious is the story of the system\n\n46:36.220 --> 46:37.980\n in the world where you write all these things\n\n46:37.980 --> 46:39.420\n into the story.\n\n46:39.420 --> 46:41.420\n You have experiences for the same reason\n\n46:41.420 --> 46:43.260\n that a character novel has experiences\n\n46:43.260 --> 46:45.780\n because it's written into the story.\n\n46:45.780 --> 46:48.220\n And now the system is acting on that story.\n\n46:48.220 --> 46:50.660\n And it's not a story that is written in a natural language.\n\n46:50.660 --> 46:52.500\n It's written in a perceptual language,\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:55.380\n in this multimedia language of the game engine.\n\n46:55.380 --> 46:59.340\n And in there, you write in what kind of experience you have\n\n46:59.340 --> 47:01.460\n and what this means for the behavior of the system,\n\n47:01.460 --> 47:03.700\n for your behavior tendencies, for your focus,\n\n47:03.700 --> 47:05.460\n for your attention, for your experience of valence\n\n47:05.460 --> 47:06.420\n and so on.\n\n47:06.420 --> 47:09.620\n And this is being used to inform the behavior of the system\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:10.740\n in the next step.\n\n47:10.740 --> 47:15.740\n And then the story updates with the reactions of the system\n\n47:15.780 --> 47:17.780\n and the changes in the world and so on.\n\n47:17.780 --> 47:19.340\n And you live inside of that model.\n\n47:19.340 --> 47:21.700\n You don't live inside of the physical reality.\n\n47:23.420 --> 47:28.420\n And I mean, just to linger on it, like you say, okay,\n\n47:28.820 --> 47:30.860\n it's in the perceptual language,\n\n47:30.860 --> 47:33.300\n the multimodal perceptual language.\n\n47:33.300 --> 47:34.900\n That's the experience.\n\n47:34.900 --> 47:38.900\n That's what consciousness is within that model,\n\n47:38.900 --> 47:40.860\n within that story.\n\n47:40.860 --> 47:42.660\n But do you have agency?\n\n47:43.980 --> 47:46.020\n When you play a video game, you can turn left\n\n47:46.020 --> 47:48.540\n and you can turn right in that story.\n\n47:49.620 --> 47:54.220\n So in that dream world, how much control do you have?\n\n47:54.220 --> 47:56.460\n Is there such a thing as you in that story?\n\n47:57.620 --> 48:00.980\n Like, is it right to say the main character,\n\n48:00.980 --> 48:02.540\n you know, everybody's NPCs,\n\n48:02.540 --> 48:04.380\n and then there's the main character\n\n48:04.380 --> 48:07.020\n and you're controlling the main character?\n\n48:07.020 --> 48:08.700\n Or is that an illusion?\n\n48:08.700 --> 48:10.900\n Is there a main character that you're controlling?\n\n48:10.900 --> 48:14.540\n I'm getting to the point of like the free will point.\n\n48:14.540 --> 48:17.780\n Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer.\n\n48:17.780 --> 48:19.900\n And you've been to MIT computer science,\n\n48:19.900 --> 48:22.060\n you basically know how to do that, right?\n\n48:22.060 --> 48:25.300\n And so you would say the robot is an agent\n\n48:25.300 --> 48:26.820\n that solves a control problem,\n\n48:27.780 --> 48:29.300\n how to get the ball into the goal.\n\n48:29.300 --> 48:30.740\n And it needs to perceive the world\n\n48:30.740 --> 48:33.260\n and the world is disturbing him in trying to do this, right?\n\n48:33.260 --> 48:35.660\n So he has to control many variables to make that happen\n\n48:35.660 --> 48:38.820\n and to project itself and the ball into the future\n\n48:38.820 --> 48:40.700\n and understand its position on the field\n\n48:40.700 --> 48:42.140\n relative to the ball and so on,\n\n48:42.140 --> 48:44.620\n and the position of its limbs\n\n48:44.620 --> 48:46.940\n or in the space around it and so on.\n\n48:46.940 --> 48:48.460\n So it needs to have an adequate model\n\n48:48.460 --> 48:51.380\n that abstracting reality in a useful way.\n\n48:51.380 --> 48:55.900\n And you could say that this robot does have agency\n\n48:55.900 --> 48:58.420\n over what it's doing in some sense.\n\n48:58.420 --> 49:01.500\n And the model is going to be a control model.\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:03.060\n And inside of that control model,\n\n49:03.060 --> 49:05.780\n you can possibly get to a point\n\n49:05.780 --> 49:07.820\n where this thing is sufficiently abstract\n\n49:07.820 --> 49:09.540\n to discover its own agency.\n\n49:09.540 --> 49:10.860\n Our current robots don't do that.\n\n49:10.860 --> 49:13.140\n They don't have a unified model of the universe,\n\n49:13.140 --> 49:16.140\n but there's not a reason why we shouldn't be getting there\n\n49:16.140 --> 49:18.660\n at some point in the not too distant future.\n\n49:18.660 --> 49:20.060\n And once that happens,\n\n49:20.060 --> 49:23.220\n you will notice that the robot tells a story\n\n49:23.220 --> 49:25.980\n about a robot playing soccer.\n\n49:25.980 --> 49:29.420\n So the robot will experience itself playing soccer\n\n49:29.420 --> 49:32.060\n in a simulation of the world that it uses\n\n49:32.060 --> 49:35.340\n to construct a model of the locations of its legs\n\n49:35.340 --> 49:38.180\n and limbs in space on the field\n\n49:38.180 --> 49:39.380\n with relationship to the ball.\n\n49:39.380 --> 49:42.220\n And it's not going to be at the level of the molecules.\n\n49:42.220 --> 49:45.300\n It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level\n\n49:45.300 --> 49:47.420\n that is most suitable for past planning\n\n49:47.420 --> 49:48.900\n of the movements of the robot.\n\n49:49.940 --> 49:51.420\n It's going to be a high level abstraction,\n\n49:51.420 --> 49:53.700\n but a very useful one that is as predictive\n\n49:53.700 --> 49:55.180\n as we can make it.\n\n49:55.180 --> 49:56.580\n And in that side of that story,\n\n49:56.580 --> 49:58.780\n there is a model of the agency of that system.\n\n49:58.780 --> 50:03.060\n So this model can accurately predict\n\n50:03.060 --> 50:04.740\n that the contents of the model\n\n50:04.740 --> 50:07.380\n are going to be driving the behavior of the robot\n\n50:07.380 --> 50:08.900\n in the immediate future.\n\n50:08.900 --> 50:12.340\n But there's the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n50:12.340 --> 50:14.580\n which I would also,\n\n50:14.580 --> 50:18.060\n there's a subjective experience of free will as well\n\n50:18.060 --> 50:20.740\n that I'm not sure where the robot gets that,\n\n50:20.740 --> 50:22.660\n where that little leap is.\n\n50:22.660 --> 50:24.260\n Because for me right now,\n\n50:24.260 --> 50:26.260\n everything I imagine with that robot,\n\n50:26.260 --> 50:29.020\n as it gets more and more and more sophisticated,\n\n50:29.020 --> 50:33.540\n the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still,\n\n50:33.540 --> 50:35.820\n of what was programmed in.\n\n50:35.820 --> 50:38.500\n You could probably do an end to end learning system.\n\n50:38.500 --> 50:40.300\n You maybe need to give it a few priors.\n\n50:40.300 --> 50:42.460\n So you nudge the architecture in the right direction\n\n50:42.460 --> 50:44.340\n that it converges more quickly,\n\n50:44.340 --> 50:47.980\n but ultimately discovering the suitable hyperparameters\n\n50:47.980 --> 50:50.340\n of the architecture is also only a search process.\n\n50:50.340 --> 50:52.740\n And as the search process was evolution,\n\n50:52.740 --> 50:55.300\n that has informed our brain architecture\n\n50:55.300 --> 50:57.380\n so we can converge in a single lifetime\n\n50:57.380 --> 50:59.500\n on useful interaction with the world\n\n50:59.500 --> 51:00.340\n and the formation of a self model.\n\n51:00.340 --> 51:03.500\n The problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly,\n\n51:03.500 --> 51:06.820\n so it's not just the parameters that control\n\n51:06.820 --> 51:08.700\n this end to end learning system,\n\n51:08.700 --> 51:11.180\n but the entirety of the design of the robot.\n\n51:11.180 --> 51:15.060\n Like there's, you have to remove the human completely\n\n51:15.060 --> 51:15.900\n from the picture.\n\n51:15.900 --> 51:17.300\n And then in order to build the robot,\n\n51:17.300 --> 51:20.340\n you have to create an entire universe.\n\n51:20.340 --> 51:22.620\n Cause you have to go, you can't just shortcut evolution.\n\n51:22.620 --> 51:24.620\n You have to go from the very beginning\n\n51:24.620 --> 51:25.860\n in order for it to have,\n\n51:25.860 --> 51:28.020\n cause I feel like there's always a human\n\n51:28.020 --> 51:32.620\n pulling the strings and that makes it seem like\n\n51:32.620 --> 51:33.900\n the robot is cheating.\n\n51:33.900 --> 51:35.940\n It's getting a shortcut to consciousness.\n\n51:35.940 --> 51:38.300\n And you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots.\n\n51:38.300 --> 51:40.140\n It doesn't look as if there is somebody\n\n51:40.140 --> 51:40.980\n pulling the strings.\n\n51:40.980 --> 51:42.420\n It doesn't look like cheating anymore.\n\n51:42.420 --> 51:43.420\n Okay, so let's go there.\n\n51:43.420 --> 51:44.860\n Cause I got to talk to you about this.\n\n51:44.860 --> 51:47.740\n So obviously with the case of Boston Dynamics,\n\n51:47.740 --> 51:49.780\n as you may or may not know,\n\n51:49.780 --> 51:54.100\n it's always either hard coded or remote controlled.\n\n51:54.100 --> 51:55.220\n There's no intelligence.\n\n51:55.220 --> 51:57.460\n I don't know how the current generation\n\n51:57.460 --> 51:59.060\n of Boston Dynamics robots works,\n\n51:59.060 --> 52:02.020\n but what I've been told about the previous ones\n\n52:02.020 --> 52:05.260\n was that it's basically all cybernetic control,\n\n52:05.260 --> 52:08.620\n which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on,\n\n52:08.620 --> 52:11.340\n but it's not deep learning for the most part\n\n52:11.340 --> 52:13.220\n as it's currently done.\n\n52:13.220 --> 52:14.700\n It's for the most part,\n\n52:14.700 --> 52:16.940\n just identifying a control hierarchy\n\n52:16.940 --> 52:19.820\n that is congruent to the limbs that exist\n\n52:19.820 --> 52:21.460\n and the parameters that need to be optimized\n\n52:21.460 --> 52:22.580\n for the movement of these limbs.\n\n52:22.580 --> 52:24.500\n And then there is a convergence progress.\n\n52:24.500 --> 52:26.220\n So it's basically just regression\n\n52:26.220 --> 52:27.900\n that you would need to control this.\n\n52:27.900 --> 52:29.420\n But again, I don't know whether that's true.\n\n52:29.420 --> 52:31.420\n That's just what I've been told about how they work.\n\n52:31.420 --> 52:35.020\n We have to separate several levels of discussion here.\n\n52:35.020 --> 52:39.300\n So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control\n\n52:39.300 --> 52:40.900\n with no machine learning\n\n52:40.900 --> 52:45.900\n in order to maintain balance or to right itself.\n\n52:45.980 --> 52:49.380\n It's a control problem in terms of using the actuators\n\n52:49.380 --> 52:52.420\n to when it's pushed or when it steps on a thing\n\n52:52.420 --> 52:55.420\n that's uneven, how to always maintain balance.\n\n52:55.420 --> 52:57.940\n And there's a tricky set of heuristics around that,\n\n52:57.940 --> 53:00.460\n but that's the only goal.\n\n53:00.460 --> 53:02.660\n Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing\n\n53:02.660 --> 53:06.140\n in terms of that to us humans is compelling,\n\n53:06.140 --> 53:09.460\n which is any kind of higher order movement,\n\n53:09.460 --> 53:12.260\n like turning, wiggling its butt,\n\n53:13.220 --> 53:18.220\n like jumping back on its two feet, dancing.\n\n53:18.740 --> 53:22.460\n Dancing is even worse because dancing is hard coded in.\n\n53:22.460 --> 53:25.300\n It's choreographed by humans.\n\n53:25.300 --> 53:27.420\n There's choreography software.\n\n53:27.420 --> 53:30.900\n So there is no, of all that high level movement,\n\n53:30.900 --> 53:34.220\n there's no anything that you can call,\n\n53:34.220 --> 53:35.940\n certainly can't call AI,\n\n53:35.940 --> 53:39.500\n but there's no even like basic heuristics.\n\n53:39.500 --> 53:41.060\n It's all hard coded in.\n\n53:41.060 --> 53:46.060\n And yet we humans immediately project agency onto them,\n\n53:47.660 --> 53:48.900\n which is fascinating.\n\n53:48.900 --> 53:53.140\n So the gap here doesn't necessarily have agency.\n\n53:53.140 --> 53:55.340\n What it has is cybernetic control.\n\n53:55.340 --> 53:57.420\n And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy\n\n53:57.420 --> 53:59.740\n of feedback loops that keep the behavior\n\n53:59.740 --> 54:02.340\n in certain boundaries so the robot doesn't fall over\n\n54:02.340 --> 54:04.140\n and it's able to perform the movements.\n\n54:04.140 --> 54:06.660\n And the choreography cannot really happen\n\n54:06.660 --> 54:09.220\n with motion capture because the robot would fall over\n\n54:09.220 --> 54:10.620\n because the physics of the robot,\n\n54:10.620 --> 54:12.780\n the weight distribution and so on is different\n\n54:12.780 --> 54:15.340\n from the weight distribution in the human body.\n\n54:15.340 --> 54:19.580\n So if you were using the directly motion captured movements\n\n54:19.580 --> 54:21.740\n of a human body to project it into this robot,\n\n54:21.740 --> 54:22.580\n it wouldn't work.\n\n54:22.580 --> 54:24.100\n You can do this with a computer animation.\n\n54:24.100 --> 54:26.140\n It will look a little bit off, but who cares?\n\n54:26.140 --> 54:29.100\n But if you want to correct for the physics,\n\n54:29.100 --> 54:31.500\n you need to basically tell the robot\n\n54:31.500 --> 54:33.740\n where it should move its limbs.\n\n54:33.740 --> 54:35.860\n And then the control algorithm is going\n\n54:35.860 --> 54:38.980\n to approximate a solution that makes it possible\n\n54:38.980 --> 54:41.020\n within the physics of the robot.\n\n54:41.020 --> 54:43.900\n And you have to find the basic solution\n\n54:43.900 --> 54:44.780\n for making that happen.\n\n54:44.780 --> 54:47.580\n And there's probably going to be some regression necessary\n\n54:47.580 --> 54:51.220\n to get the control architecture to make these movements.\n\n54:51.220 --> 54:52.660\n But those two layers are separate.\n\n54:52.660 --> 54:56.180\n So the thing, the higher level instruction\n\n54:56.180 --> 54:59.060\n of how you should move and where you should move\n\n54:59.060 --> 54:59.900\n is a higher level.\n\n54:59.900 --> 55:01.700\n Yeah, so I expect that the control level\n\n55:01.700 --> 55:03.620\n of these robots at some level is dumb.\n\n55:03.620 --> 55:06.180\n This is just the physical control movement,\n\n55:06.180 --> 55:07.860\n the motor architecture.\n\n55:07.860 --> 55:10.340\n But it's a relatively smart motor architecture.\n\n55:10.340 --> 55:12.500\n It's just that there is no high level deliberation\n\n55:12.500 --> 55:14.620\n about what decisions to make necessarily, right?\n\n55:14.620 --> 55:17.900\n But see, it doesn't feel like free will or consciousness.\n\n55:17.900 --> 55:20.580\n No, no, that was not where I was trying to get to.\n\n55:20.580 --> 55:24.540\n I think that in our own body, we have that too.\n\n55:24.540 --> 55:26.900\n So we have a certain thing that is basically\n\n55:26.900 --> 55:29.540\n just a cybernetic control architecture\n\n55:29.540 --> 55:31.300\n that is moving our limbs.\n\n55:31.300 --> 55:34.300\n And deep learning can help in discovering\n\n55:34.300 --> 55:35.940\n such an architecture if you don't have it\n\n55:35.940 --> 55:37.220\n in the first place.\n\n55:37.220 --> 55:38.620\n If you already know your hardware,\n\n55:38.620 --> 55:40.700\n you can maybe handcraft it.\n\n55:40.700 --> 55:41.900\n But if you don't know your hardware,\n\n55:41.900 --> 55:43.740\n you can search for such an architecture.\n\n55:43.740 --> 55:46.980\n And this work already existed in the 80s and 90s.\n\n55:46.980 --> 55:49.820\n People were starting to search for control architectures\n\n55:49.820 --> 55:51.140\n by motor babbling and so on,\n\n55:51.140 --> 55:53.900\n and just use reinforcement learning architectures\n\n55:53.900 --> 55:55.580\n to discover such a thing.\n\n55:55.580 --> 55:57.740\n And now imagine that you have\n\n55:57.740 --> 56:01.540\n the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you.\n\n56:01.540 --> 56:03.700\n And you extend this a little bit.\n\n56:03.700 --> 56:06.460\n So you are seeking out food, for instance,\n\n56:06.460 --> 56:08.300\n or rest or and so on.\n\n56:08.300 --> 56:11.820\n And you get to have a baby at some point.\n\n56:11.820 --> 56:15.740\n And now you add more and more control layers to this.\n\n56:15.740 --> 56:17.780\n And the system is reverse engineering\n\n56:17.780 --> 56:19.620\n its own control architecture\n\n56:19.620 --> 56:22.460\n and builds a high level model to synchronize\n\n56:22.460 --> 56:26.340\n the pursuit of very different conflicting goals.\n\n56:26.340 --> 56:28.180\n And this is how I think you get to purposes.\n\n56:28.180 --> 56:30.060\n Purposes are models of your goals.\n\n56:30.060 --> 56:31.540\n The goals may be intrinsic\n\n56:31.540 --> 56:33.820\n as the result of the different set point violations\n\n56:33.820 --> 56:34.660\n that you have,\n\n56:34.660 --> 56:37.140\n hunger and thirst for very different things,\n\n56:37.140 --> 56:39.380\n and rest and pain avoidance and so on.\n\n56:39.380 --> 56:41.100\n And you put all these things together\n\n56:41.100 --> 56:44.180\n and eventually you need to come up with a strategy\n\n56:44.180 --> 56:46.020\n to synchronize them all.\n\n56:46.020 --> 56:49.340\n And you don't need just to do this alone by yourself\n\n56:49.340 --> 56:51.340\n because we are state building organisms.\n\n56:51.340 --> 56:53.700\n We cannot function as isolation\n\n56:53.700 --> 56:55.820\n the way that homo sapiens is set up.\n\n56:55.820 --> 56:58.100\n So our own behavior only makes sense\n\n56:58.100 --> 57:00.980\n when you zoom out very far into a society\n\n57:00.980 --> 57:04.900\n or even into ecosystemic intelligence on the planet\n\n57:04.900 --> 57:06.500\n and our place in it.\n\n57:06.500 --> 57:08.460\n So the individual behavior only makes sense\n\n57:08.460 --> 57:09.980\n in these larger contexts.\n\n57:09.980 --> 57:11.820\n And we have a number of priors built into us.\n\n57:11.820 --> 57:14.660\n So we are behaving as if we were acting\n\n57:14.660 --> 57:17.900\n on these high level goals pretty much right from the start.\n\n57:17.900 --> 57:19.820\n And eventually in the course of our life,\n\n57:19.820 --> 57:22.700\n we can reverse engineer the goals that we're acting on,\n\n57:22.700 --> 57:25.820\n what actually are our higher level purposes.\n\n57:25.820 --> 57:27.100\n And the more we understand that,\n\n57:27.100 --> 57:28.660\n the more our behavior makes sense.\n\n57:28.660 --> 57:30.380\n But this is all at this point,\n\n57:30.380 --> 57:32.420\n complex stories within stories\n\n57:32.420 --> 57:34.580\n that are driving our behavior.\n\n57:34.580 --> 57:38.500\n Yeah, I just don't know how big of a leap it is\n\n57:38.500 --> 57:40.940\n to start create a system\n\n57:40.940 --> 57:42.980\n that's able to tell stories within stories.\n\n57:44.340 --> 57:45.580\n Like how big of a leap that is\n\n57:45.580 --> 57:48.260\n from where currently Boston Dynamics is\n\n57:48.260 --> 57:50.900\n or any robot that's operating in the physical space.\n\n57:53.820 --> 57:56.220\n And that leap might be big\n\n57:56.220 --> 57:59.380\n if it requires to solve the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n57:59.380 --> 58:01.620\n which is telling a hell of a good story.\n\n58:01.620 --> 58:05.220\n I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple.\n\n58:05.220 --> 58:06.420\n What's hard is perception\n\n58:07.300 --> 58:09.860\n and the interface between perception and reasoning.\n\n58:11.100 --> 58:14.700\n That's for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior\n\n58:14.700 --> 58:18.740\n that would be built into such a system by Yoshua Bengio.\n\n58:18.740 --> 58:22.260\n And what he describes, and I think that's accurate,\n\n58:22.260 --> 58:27.260\n is that our own model of the world\n\n58:27.260 --> 58:29.820\n can be described through something like an energy function.\n\n58:29.820 --> 58:32.700\n The energy function is modeling the contradictions\n\n58:32.700 --> 58:34.820\n that exist within the model at any given point.\n\n58:34.820 --> 58:36.620\n And you try to minimize these contradictions,\n\n58:36.620 --> 58:38.340\n the tangents in the model.\n\n58:38.340 --> 58:41.380\n And to do this, you need to sometimes test things.\n\n58:41.380 --> 58:43.740\n You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground.\n\n58:43.740 --> 58:46.500\n You need to distinguish whether this is true\n\n58:46.500 --> 58:47.940\n or that is true, and so on.\n\n58:47.940 --> 58:49.500\n Eventually you get to an interpretation,\n\n58:49.500 --> 58:52.300\n but you will need to manually depress a few points\n\n58:52.300 --> 58:55.580\n in your model to let it snap into a state that makes sense.\n\n58:55.580 --> 58:57.740\n And this function that tries to get the biggest dip\n\n58:57.740 --> 58:59.620\n in the energy function in your model,\n\n58:59.620 --> 59:02.340\n according to Yoshua Bengio, is related to consciousness.\n\n59:02.340 --> 59:04.620\n It's a low dimensional discrete function\n\n59:04.620 --> 59:08.220\n that tries to maximize this dip in the energy function.\n\n59:09.580 --> 59:13.340\n Yeah, I think I would need to dig into details\n\n59:13.340 --> 59:15.580\n because I think the way he uses the word consciousness\n\n59:15.580 --> 59:17.780\n is more akin to like self awareness,\n\n59:17.780 --> 59:20.860\n like modeling yourself within the world,\n\n59:20.860 --> 59:23.660\n as opposed to the subjective experience, the hard problem.\n\n59:23.660 --> 59:26.580\n No, it's not even the self is in the world.\n\n59:26.580 --> 59:28.820\n The self is the agent and you don't need to be aware\n\n59:28.820 --> 59:31.100\n of yourself in order to be conscious.\n\n59:31.100 --> 59:34.380\n The self is just a particular content that you can have,\n\n59:34.380 --> 59:35.980\n but you don't have to have.\n\n59:35.980 --> 59:39.700\n But you can be conscious in, for instance, a dream at night\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:42.940\n or during a meditation state where you don't have a self.\n\n59:42.940 --> 59:43.780\n Right.\n\n59:43.780 --> 59:45.620\n Where you're just aware of the fact that you are aware.\n\n59:45.620 --> 59:49.900\n And what we mean by consciousness in the colloquial sense\n\n59:49.900 --> 59:53.820\n is largely this reflexive self awareness,\n\n59:53.820 --> 59:55.220\n that we become aware of the fact\n\n59:55.220 --> 59:57.300\n that you're paying attention,\n\n59:57.300 --> 59:59.220\n that we are the thing that pays attention.\n\n59:59.220 --> 1:00:02.020\n We are the thing that pays attention, right.\n\n1:00:02.020 --> 1:00:07.020\n I don't see where the awareness that we're aware,\n\n1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:10.620\n the hard problem doesn't feel like it's solved.\n\n1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:14.820\n I mean, it's called a hard problem for a reason,\n\n1:00:14.820 --> 1:00:19.380\n because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.\n\n1:00:19.380 --> 1:00:21.660\n Yeah, I think the major leap is to understand\n\n1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:25.300\n how it is possible that a machine can dream,\n\n1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:29.540\n that a physical system is able to create a representation\n\n1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:31.260\n that the physical system is acting on,\n\n1:00:31.260 --> 1:00:33.980\n and that is spun force and so on.\n\n1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:36.700\n But once you accept the fact that you are not in physics,\n\n1:00:36.700 --> 1:00:39.220\n but that you exist inside of the story,\n\n1:00:39.220 --> 1:00:40.620\n I think the mystery disappears.\n\n1:00:40.620 --> 1:00:41.940\n Everything is possible in the story.\n\n1:00:41.940 --> 1:00:43.340\n You exist inside the story.\n\n1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:44.180\n Okay, so the machine.\n\n1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:45.780\n Your consciousness is being written into the story.\n\n1:00:45.780 --> 1:00:47.340\n The fact that you experience things\n\n1:00:47.340 --> 1:00:48.860\n is written to the side of the story.\n\n1:00:48.860 --> 1:00:51.300\n You ask yourself, is this real what I'm seeing?\n\n1:00:51.300 --> 1:00:53.860\n And your brain writes into the story, yes, it's real.\n\n1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:56.340\n So what about the perception of consciousness?\n\n1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:59.540\n So to me, you look conscious.\n\n1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:02.500\n So the illusion of consciousness,\n\n1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:04.340\n the demonstration of consciousness.\n\n1:01:04.340 --> 1:01:07.700\n I ask for the legged robot.\n\n1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:10.580\n How do we make this legged robot conscious?\n\n1:01:10.580 --> 1:01:12.820\n So there's two things,\n\n1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:16.340\n and maybe you can tell me if they're neighboring ideas.\n\n1:01:16.340 --> 1:01:18.860\n One is actually make it conscious,\n\n1:01:18.860 --> 1:01:21.700\n and the other is make it appear conscious to others.\n\n1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:23.740\n Are those related?\n\n1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:27.380\n Let's ask it from the other direction.\n\n1:01:27.380 --> 1:01:30.060\n What would it take to make you not conscious?\n\n1:01:31.140 --> 1:01:35.180\n So when you are thinking about how you perceive the world,\n\n1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:39.820\n can you decide to switch from looking at qualia\n\n1:01:39.820 --> 1:01:41.820\n to looking at representational states?\n\n1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:44.900\n And it turns out you can.\n\n1:01:44.900 --> 1:01:48.340\n There is a particular way in which you can look at the world\n\n1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:51.420\n and recognize its machine nature, including your own.\n\n1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:52.420\n And in that state,\n\n1:01:52.420 --> 1:01:54.260\n you don't have that conscious experience\n\n1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:55.740\n in this way anymore.\n\n1:01:55.740 --> 1:01:59.660\n It becomes apparent as a representation.\n\n1:01:59.660 --> 1:02:01.580\n Everything becomes opaque.\n\n1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:04.020\n And I think this thing that you recognize,\n\n1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:05.380\n everything is a representation.\n\n1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:08.220\n This is typically what we mean with enlightenment states.\n\n1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:11.700\n And it can happen on the motivational level,\n\n1:02:11.700 --> 1:02:14.820\n but you can also do this on the experiential level,\n\n1:02:14.820 --> 1:02:16.220\n on the perceptual level.\n\n1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:18.820\n See, but then I can come back to a conscious state.\n\n1:02:20.420 --> 1:02:22.180\n Okay, I particularly,\n\n1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:26.940\n I'm referring to the social aspect\n\n1:02:26.940 --> 1:02:30.100\n that the demonstration of consciousness\n\n1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:32.140\n is a really nice thing at a party\n\n1:02:32.140 --> 1:02:34.460\n when you're trying to meet a new person.\n\n1:02:34.460 --> 1:02:38.300\n It's a nice thing to know that they're conscious\n\n1:02:38.300 --> 1:02:39.380\n and they can,\n\n1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:42.700\n I don't know how fundamental consciousness\n\n1:02:42.700 --> 1:02:43.900\n is in human interaction,\n\n1:02:43.900 --> 1:02:48.020\n but it seems like to be at least an important part.\n\n1:02:48.020 --> 1:02:53.020\n And I ask that in the same kind of way for robots.\n\n1:02:53.620 --> 1:02:56.340\n In order to create a rich, compelling\n\n1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:58.380\n human robot interaction,\n\n1:02:58.380 --> 1:03:00.740\n it feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness\n\n1:03:00.740 --> 1:03:02.660\n within that interaction.\n\n1:03:02.660 --> 1:03:04.900\n My cat is obviously conscious.\n\n1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:07.380\n And so my cat can do this party trick.\n\n1:03:07.380 --> 1:03:09.220\n She also knows that I am conscious,\n\n1:03:09.220 --> 1:03:11.380\n be able to have feedback about the fact\n\n1:03:11.380 --> 1:03:14.860\n that we are both acting on models of our own awareness.\n\n1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:19.660\n The question is how hard is it for the robot,\n\n1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:22.060\n artificially created robot to achieve cat level\n\n1:03:22.060 --> 1:03:24.380\n and party tricks?\n\n1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:27.300\n Yes, so the issue for me is currently not so much\n\n1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:30.300\n on how to build a system that creates a story\n\n1:03:30.300 --> 1:03:32.860\n about a robot that lives in the world,\n\n1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:35.500\n but to make an adequate representation of the world.\n\n1:03:36.540 --> 1:03:40.260\n And the model that you and me have is a unified one.\n\n1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:44.060\n It's one where you basically make sense of everything\n\n1:03:44.060 --> 1:03:44.980\n that you can perceive.\n\n1:03:44.980 --> 1:03:47.940\n Every feature in the world that enters your perception\n\n1:03:47.940 --> 1:03:51.780\n can be relationally mapped to a unified model of everything.\n\n1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:54.060\n And we don't have an AI that is able to construct\n\n1:03:54.060 --> 1:03:56.220\n such a unified model yet.\n\n1:03:56.220 --> 1:03:58.820\n So you need that unified model to do the party trick?\n\n1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:01.780\n Yes, I think that it doesn't make sense\n\n1:04:01.780 --> 1:04:03.060\n if this thing is conscious,\n\n1:04:03.060 --> 1:04:04.660\n but not in the same universe as you,\n\n1:04:04.660 --> 1:04:06.780\n because you could not relate to each other.\n\n1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:08.980\n So what's the process, would you say,\n\n1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:12.060\n of engineering consciousness in the machine?\n\n1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:14.580\n Like what are the ideas here?\n\n1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:19.060\n So you probably want to have some kind of perceptual system.\n\n1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:21.300\n This perceptual system is a processing agent\n\n1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:23.860\n that is able to track sensory data\n\n1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:26.740\n and predict the next frame in the sensory data\n\n1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:29.780\n from the previous frames of the sensory data\n\n1:04:29.780 --> 1:04:31.740\n and the current state of the system.\n\n1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:34.580\n So the current state of the system is, in perception,\n\n1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:37.580\n instrumental to predicting what happens next.\n\n1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:39.780\n And this means you build lots and lots of functions\n\n1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:42.100\n that take all the blips that you feel on your skin\n\n1:04:42.100 --> 1:04:45.540\n and that you see on your retina, or that you hear,\n\n1:04:45.540 --> 1:04:48.100\n and puts them into a set of relationships\n\n1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:51.180\n that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data,\n\n1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:53.780\n what kind of sensor of blips, vector of blips,\n\n1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:56.060\n you're going to perceive in the next frame.\n\n1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:59.180\n This is tuned and it's constantly tuned\n\n1:04:59.180 --> 1:05:01.940\n until it gets as accurate as it can.\n\n1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:05.100\n You build a very accurate prediction mechanism\n\n1:05:05.100 --> 1:05:08.060\n that is step one of the perception.\n\n1:05:08.060 --> 1:05:09.900\n So first you predict, then you perceive\n\n1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:11.740\n and see the error in your prediction.\n\n1:05:11.740 --> 1:05:13.820\n And you have to do two things to make that happen.\n\n1:05:13.820 --> 1:05:16.900\n One is you have to build a network of relationships\n\n1:05:16.900 --> 1:05:18.460\n that are constraints,\n\n1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:21.020\n that take all the variants in the world\n\n1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:24.420\n and put each of the variances into a variable\n\n1:05:24.420 --> 1:05:27.940\n that is connected with relationships to other variables.\n\n1:05:27.940 --> 1:05:30.060\n And these relationships are computable functions\n\n1:05:30.060 --> 1:05:31.140\n that constrain each other.\n\n1:05:31.140 --> 1:05:32.260\n So when you see a nose\n\n1:05:32.260 --> 1:05:34.900\n that points in a certain direction in space,\n\n1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.100\n you have a constraint that says\n\n1:05:36.100 --> 1:05:39.260\n there should be a face nearby that has the same direction.\n\n1:05:39.260 --> 1:05:40.380\n And if that is not the case,\n\n1:05:40.380 --> 1:05:41.700\n you have some kind of contradiction\n\n1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:42.540\n that you need to resolve\n\n1:05:42.540 --> 1:05:44.620\n because it's probably not a nose what you're looking at.\n\n1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:45.940\n It just looks like one.\n\n1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:48.580\n So you have to reinterpret the data\n\n1:05:48.580 --> 1:05:52.460\n until you get to a point where your model converges.\n\n1:05:52.460 --> 1:05:54.940\n And this process of making the sensory data\n\n1:05:54.940 --> 1:05:56.700\n fit into your model structure\n\n1:05:56.700 --> 1:06:01.140\n is what Piaget calls the assimilation.\n\n1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:04.060\n And accommodation is the change of the models\n\n1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:05.700\n where you change your model in such a way\n\n1:06:05.700 --> 1:06:08.140\n that you can assimilate everything.\n\n1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:09.860\n So you're talking about building\n\n1:06:09.860 --> 1:06:12.380\n a hell of an awesome perception system\n\n1:06:12.380 --> 1:06:14.700\n that's able to do prediction and perception\n\n1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:15.980\n and correct and keep improving.\n\n1:06:15.980 --> 1:06:17.740\n No, wait, that's...\n\n1:06:17.740 --> 1:06:18.660\n Wait, there's more.\n\n1:06:18.660 --> 1:06:19.580\n Yes, there's more.\n\n1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:21.500\n So the first thing that we wanted to do\n\n1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:24.660\n is we want to minimize the contradictions in the model.\n\n1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:26.700\n And of course, it's very easy to make a model\n\n1:06:26.700 --> 1:06:28.220\n in which you minimize the contradictions\n\n1:06:28.220 --> 1:06:29.700\n just by allowing that it can be\n\n1:06:29.700 --> 1:06:31.500\n in many, many possible states, right?\n\n1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:33.980\n So if you increase degrees of freedom,\n\n1:06:33.980 --> 1:06:35.860\n you will have fewer contradictions.\n\n1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:37.820\n But you also want to reduce the degrees of freedom\n\n1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:40.260\n because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty.\n\n1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.420\n You want your model to reduce uncertainty\n\n1:06:42.420 --> 1:06:44.380\n as much as possible,\n\n1:06:44.380 --> 1:06:46.540\n but reducing uncertainty is expensive.\n\n1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:47.780\n So you have to have a trade off\n\n1:06:47.780 --> 1:06:50.340\n between minimizing contradictions\n\n1:06:50.340 --> 1:06:52.380\n and reducing uncertainty.\n\n1:06:52.380 --> 1:06:54.620\n And you have only a finite amount of compute\n\n1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:57.020\n and experimental time and effort\n\n1:06:57.020 --> 1:06:59.260\n available to reduce uncertainty in the world.\n\n1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:02.740\n So you need to assign value to what you observe.\n\n1:07:02.740 --> 1:07:05.060\n So you need some kind of motivational system\n\n1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:07.660\n that is estimating what you should be looking at\n\n1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:09.180\n and what you should be thinking about it,\n\n1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:10.900\n how you should be applying your resources\n\n1:07:10.900 --> 1:07:12.900\n to model what that is, right?\n\n1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:15.940\n So you need to have something like convergence links\n\n1:07:15.940 --> 1:07:17.540\n that tell you how to get from the present state\n\n1:07:17.540 --> 1:07:19.020\n of the model to the next one.\n\n1:07:19.020 --> 1:07:20.620\n You need to have these compatibility links\n\n1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:23.500\n that tell you which constraints exist\n\n1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:25.500\n and which constraint violations exist.\n\n1:07:25.500 --> 1:07:28.900\n And you need to have some kind of motivational system\n\n1:07:28.900 --> 1:07:30.700\n that tells you what to pay attention to.\n\n1:07:30.700 --> 1:07:32.980\n So now we have a second agent next to the perceptual agent.\n\n1:07:32.980 --> 1:07:34.860\n We have a motivational agent.\n\n1:07:34.860 --> 1:07:36.260\n This is a cybernetic system\n\n1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.740\n that is modeling what the system needs,\n\n1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:40.460\n what's important for the system,\n\n1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:42.100\n and that interacts with the perceptual system\n\n1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:44.540\n to maximize the expected reward.\n\n1:07:44.540 --> 1:07:46.020\n And you're saying the motivational system\n\n1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:49.580\n is some kind of like, what is it?\n\n1:07:49.580 --> 1:07:52.500\n A high level narrative over some lower level.\n\n1:07:52.500 --> 1:07:53.980\n No, it's just your brainstem stuff,\n\n1:07:53.980 --> 1:07:55.660\n the limbic system stuff that tells you,\n\n1:07:55.660 --> 1:07:57.660\n okay, now you should get something to eat\n\n1:07:57.660 --> 1:07:59.380\n because I've just measured your blood sugar.\n\n1:07:59.380 --> 1:08:00.940\n So you mean like motivational system,\n\n1:08:00.940 --> 1:08:03.060\n like the lower level stuff, like hungry.\n\n1:08:03.060 --> 1:08:05.700\n Yes, there's basically physiological needs\n\n1:08:05.700 --> 1:08:07.500\n and some cognitive needs and some social needs\n\n1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.420\n and they all interact.\n\n1:08:08.420 --> 1:08:10.220\n And they're all implemented at different parts\n\n1:08:10.220 --> 1:08:12.660\n in your nervous system as the motivational system.\n\n1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:14.700\n But they're basically cybernetic feedback loops.\n\n1:08:14.700 --> 1:08:16.420\n It's not that complicated.\n\n1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:18.260\n It's just a lot of code.\n\n1:08:18.260 --> 1:08:21.420\n And so you now have a motivational agent\n\n1:08:21.420 --> 1:08:23.100\n that makes your robot go for the ball\n\n1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:27.580\n or that makes your worm go to eat food and so on.\n\n1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:29.140\n And you have the perceptual system\n\n1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:30.580\n that lets it predict the environment\n\n1:08:30.580 --> 1:08:33.620\n so it's able to solve that control problem to some degree.\n\n1:08:33.620 --> 1:08:35.780\n And now what we learned is that it's very hard\n\n1:08:35.780 --> 1:08:37.220\n to build a machine learning system\n\n1:08:37.220 --> 1:08:39.340\n that looks at all the data simultaneously\n\n1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:41.300\n to see what kind of relationships\n\n1:08:41.300 --> 1:08:43.260\n could exist between them.\n\n1:08:43.260 --> 1:08:45.580\n So you need to selectively model the world.\n\n1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:48.300\n You need to figure out where can I make the biggest difference\n\n1:08:48.300 --> 1:08:50.980\n if I would put the following things together.\n\n1:08:50.980 --> 1:08:53.020\n Sometimes you find a gradient for that.\n\n1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:54.180\n When you have a gradient,\n\n1:08:54.180 --> 1:08:56.460\n you don't need to remember where you came from.\n\n1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:57.540\n You just follow the gradient\n\n1:08:57.540 --> 1:08:59.340\n until it doesn't get any better.\n\n1:08:59.340 --> 1:09:02.140\n But if you have a world where the problems are discontinuous\n\n1:09:02.140 --> 1:09:04.260\n and the search spaces are discontinuous,\n\n1:09:04.260 --> 1:09:07.300\n you need to retain memory of what you explored.\n\n1:09:07.300 --> 1:09:10.540\n You need to construct a plan of what to explore next.\n\n1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:13.300\n And this thing means that you have next\n\n1:09:13.300 --> 1:09:15.340\n to this perceptual construction system\n\n1:09:15.340 --> 1:09:17.620\n and the motivational cybernetics,\n\n1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:20.220\n an agent that is paying attention\n\n1:09:20.220 --> 1:09:22.700\n to what it should select at any given moment\n\n1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:24.300\n to maximize reward.\n\n1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:27.460\n And this scanning system, this attention agent,\n\n1:09:27.460 --> 1:09:28.900\n is required for consciousness\n\n1:09:28.900 --> 1:09:31.420\n and consciousness is its control model.\n\n1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:36.140\n So it's the index memories that this thing retains\n\n1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:39.180\n when it manipulates the perceptual representations\n\n1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:43.020\n to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts\n\n1:09:43.020 --> 1:09:44.820\n and to increase coherence.\n\n1:09:44.820 --> 1:09:47.740\n So the purpose of consciousness is to create coherence\n\n1:09:47.740 --> 1:09:49.500\n in your perceptual representations,\n\n1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:52.140\n remove conflicts, predict the future,\n\n1:09:52.140 --> 1:09:54.100\n construct counterfactual representations\n\n1:09:54.100 --> 1:09:56.300\n so you can coordinate your actions and so on.\n\n1:09:57.460 --> 1:10:00.220\n And in order to do this, it needs to form memories.\n\n1:10:00.220 --> 1:10:02.340\n These memories are partial binding states\n\n1:10:02.340 --> 1:10:04.100\n of the working memory contents\n\n1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:07.100\n that are being revisited later on to backtrack,\n\n1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:10.140\n to undo certain states, to look for alternatives.\n\n1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.020\n And these index memories that you can recall,\n\n1:10:13.020 --> 1:10:15.940\n that is what you perceive as your stream of consciousness.\n\n1:10:15.940 --> 1:10:17.860\n And being able to recall these memories,\n\n1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:19.420\n this is what makes you conscious.\n\n1:10:19.420 --> 1:10:21.660\n If you could not remember what you paid attention to,\n\n1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:22.980\n you wouldn't be conscious.\n\n1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:29.140\n So consciousness is the index in the memory database.\n\n1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:29.980\n Okay.\n\n1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:35.500\n But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness\n\n1:10:35.500 --> 1:10:37.180\n a little further.\n\n1:10:37.180 --> 1:10:42.180\n So we usually relate suffering to consciousness.\n\n1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:44.340\n So the capacity to suffer.\n\n1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:49.700\n I think to me, that's a really strong sign of consciousness\n\n1:10:49.700 --> 1:10:51.180\n is a thing that can suffer.\n\n1:10:52.460 --> 1:10:54.100\n How is that useful?\n\n1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:55.940\n Suffering.\n\n1:10:57.140 --> 1:10:59.540\n And like in your model where you just described,\n\n1:10:59.540 --> 1:11:03.740\n which is indexing of memories and what is the coherence\n\n1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:07.220\n with the perception, with this predictive thing\n\n1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:09.260\n that's going on in the perception,\n\n1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:11.700\n how does suffering relate to any of that?\n\n1:11:13.060 --> 1:11:15.060\n The higher level suffering that humans do.\n\n1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:20.020\n Basically pain is a reinforcement signal.\n\n1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:23.380\n Pain is a signal that one part of your brain\n\n1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:25.140\n sends to another part of your brain,\n\n1:11:25.140 --> 1:11:27.940\n or in an abstract sense, part of your mind\n\n1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:30.860\n sends to another part of the mind to regulate its behavior,\n\n1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:33.540\n to tell it the behavior that you're currently exhibiting\n\n1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:34.940\n should be improved.\n\n1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:39.020\n And this is the signal that I tell you to move away\n\n1:11:39.020 --> 1:11:40.180\n from what you're currently doing\n\n1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:42.300\n and push into a different direction.\n\n1:11:42.300 --> 1:11:46.060\n So pain gives you a part of you an impulse\n\n1:11:46.060 --> 1:11:47.940\n to do something differently.\n\n1:11:47.940 --> 1:11:49.940\n But sometimes this doesn't work\n\n1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:52.140\n because the training part of your brain\n\n1:11:52.140 --> 1:11:54.220\n is talking to the wrong region,\n\n1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:55.900\n or because it has the wrong model\n\n1:11:55.900 --> 1:11:57.180\n of the relationships in the world.\n\n1:11:57.180 --> 1:11:58.580\n Maybe you're mismodeling yourself\n\n1:11:58.580 --> 1:12:00.860\n or you're mismodeling the relationship of yourself\n\n1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:01.700\n to the world,\n\n1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:03.500\n or you're mismodeling the dynamics of the world.\n\n1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.940\n So you're trying to improve something\n\n1:12:04.940 --> 1:12:07.900\n that cannot be improved by generating more pain.\n\n1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:10.380\n But the system doesn't have any alternative.\n\n1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:12.340\n So it doesn't get better.\n\n1:12:12.340 --> 1:12:14.220\n What do you do if something doesn't get better\n\n1:12:14.220 --> 1:12:15.540\n and you want it to get better?\n\n1:12:15.540 --> 1:12:17.940\n You increase the strengths of the signal.\n\n1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.580\n And then the signal becomes chronic\n\n1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:22.220\n when it becomes permanent without a change inside.\n\n1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:24.300\n This is what we call suffering.\n\n1:12:24.300 --> 1:12:26.420\n And the purpose of consciousness\n\n1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:28.180\n is to deal with contradictions,\n\n1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:30.300\n with things that cannot be resolved.\n\n1:12:30.300 --> 1:12:31.740\n The purpose of consciousness,\n\n1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:35.060\n I think is similar to a conductor in an orchestra.\n\n1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:36.420\n When everything works well,\n\n1:12:36.420 --> 1:12:38.580\n the orchestra doesn't need much of a conductor\n\n1:12:38.580 --> 1:12:40.260\n as long as it's coherent.\n\n1:12:40.260 --> 1:12:42.020\n But when there is a lack of coherence\n\n1:12:42.020 --> 1:12:44.340\n or something is consistently producing\n\n1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:46.220\n disharmony and mismatches,\n\n1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:48.980\n then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it.\n\n1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:52.660\n So suffering attracts the activity of our consciousness.\n\n1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:54.740\n And the purpose of that is ideally\n\n1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:56.660\n that we bring new layers online,\n\n1:12:56.660 --> 1:13:00.460\n new layers of modeling that are able to create\n\n1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:03.620\n a model of the dysregulation so we can deal with it.\n\n1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:06.860\n And this means that we typically get\n\n1:13:06.860 --> 1:13:08.820\n higher level consciousness, so to speak, right?\n\n1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:11.420\n We get some consciousness above our pay grade maybe\n\n1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:13.260\n if we have some suffering early in our life.\n\n1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:14.820\n Most of the interesting people\n\n1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:17.060\n had trauma early on in their childhood.\n\n1:13:17.060 --> 1:13:20.940\n And trauma means that you are suffering an injury\n\n1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:23.060\n for which the system is not prepared,\n\n1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:24.380\n which it cannot deal with,\n\n1:13:24.380 --> 1:13:26.260\n which it cannot insulate itself from.\n\n1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:27.940\n So something breaks.\n\n1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:29.860\n And this means that the behavior of the system\n\n1:13:29.860 --> 1:13:34.020\n is permanently disturbed in a way\n\n1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:37.500\n that some mismatch exists now in the regulation\n\n1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.100\n that just by following your impulses,\n\n1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:41.860\n by following the pain in the direction where it hurts,\n\n1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:44.380\n the situation doesn't improve but get worse.\n\n1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:46.940\n And so what needs to happen is that you grow up.\n\n1:13:47.940 --> 1:13:49.540\n And that's part that has grown up\n\n1:13:49.540 --> 1:13:51.180\n is able to deal with the part\n\n1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:53.340\n that is stuck in this earlier phase.\n\n1:13:53.340 --> 1:13:54.580\n Yeah, so at least to grow,\n\n1:13:54.580 --> 1:13:58.060\n so you're adding extra layers to your cognition.\n\n1:13:58.060 --> 1:14:00.380\n And let me ask you then,\n\n1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:02.380\n because I gotta stick on suffering,\n\n1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:03.860\n the ethics of the whole thing.\n\n1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:08.900\n So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others.\n\n1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:13.380\n You've tweeted, one of my biggest fears\n\n1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:16.260\n is that insects could be conscious.\n\n1:14:16.260 --> 1:14:18.980\n The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable.\n\n1:14:20.300 --> 1:14:24.380\n So when we think of other conscious beings,\n\n1:14:24.380 --> 1:14:29.380\n is suffering a property of consciousness\n\n1:14:30.300 --> 1:14:32.660\n that we're most concerned about?\n\n1:14:32.660 --> 1:14:37.660\n So I'm still thinking about robots,\n\n1:14:40.140 --> 1:14:43.140\n how to make sense of other nonhuman things\n\n1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:48.380\n that appear to have the depth of experience\n\n1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:49.460\n that humans have.\n\n1:14:50.700 --> 1:14:54.020\n And to me, that means consciousness\n\n1:14:54.020 --> 1:14:57.460\n and the darkest side of that, which is suffering,\n\n1:14:57.460 --> 1:14:58.860\n the capacity to suffer.\n\n1:15:00.380 --> 1:15:02.420\n And so I started thinking,\n\n1:15:02.420 --> 1:15:04.100\n how much responsibility do we have\n\n1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:06.620\n for those other conscious beings?\n\n1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:10.980\n That's where the definition of consciousness\n\n1:15:10.980 --> 1:15:13.100\n becomes most urgent.\n\n1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:15.140\n Like having to come up with a definition of consciousness\n\n1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:16.900\n becomes most urgent,\n\n1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:24.740\n is who should we and should we not be torturing?\n\n1:15:24.740 --> 1:15:26.300\n There's no general answer to this.\n\n1:15:26.300 --> 1:15:29.100\n Was Genghis Khan doing anything wrong?\n\n1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:31.900\n It depends right on how you look at it.\n\n1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:35.340\n Well, he drew a line somewhere\n\n1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:38.820\n where this is us and that's them.\n\n1:15:38.820 --> 1:15:40.820\n It's the circle of empathy.\n\n1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:42.860\n It's like these,\n\n1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:44.820\n you don't have to use the word consciousness,\n\n1:15:44.820 --> 1:15:48.980\n but these are the things that matter to me\n\n1:15:48.980 --> 1:15:50.100\n if they suffer or not.\n\n1:15:50.100 --> 1:15:52.340\n And these are the things that don't matter to him.\n\n1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:54.580\n Yeah, but when one of his commanders failed him,\n\n1:15:54.580 --> 1:15:59.140\n he broke his spine and let him die in a horrible way.\n\n1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:01.420\n And so in some sense,\n\n1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:03.860\n I think he was indifferent to suffering\n\n1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:05.820\n or he was not different in the sense\n\n1:16:05.820 --> 1:16:09.420\n that he didn't see it as useful if he inflicted suffering,\n\n1:16:10.380 --> 1:16:14.100\n but he did not see it as something that had to be avoided.\n\n1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:15.460\n That was not the goal.\n\n1:16:15.460 --> 1:16:18.860\n The question was, how can I use suffering\n\n1:16:18.860 --> 1:16:21.260\n and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals\n\n1:16:21.260 --> 1:16:22.420\n from his perspective?\n\n1:16:23.900 --> 1:16:24.740\n I see.\n\n1:16:24.740 --> 1:16:26.700\n So like different societies throughout history\n\n1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:29.940\n put different value on the...\n\n1:16:29.940 --> 1:16:31.580\n Different individuals, different psyches.\n\n1:16:31.580 --> 1:16:35.100\n But also even the objective of avoiding suffering,\n\n1:16:35.100 --> 1:16:37.540\n like some societies probably,\n\n1:16:37.540 --> 1:16:40.740\n I mean, this is where like religious belief really helps\n\n1:16:40.740 --> 1:16:44.700\n that afterlife, that it doesn't matter\n\n1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:45.980\n that you suffer or die,\n\n1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:49.300\n what matters is you suffer honorably, right?\n\n1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:52.260\n So that you enter the afterlife as a hero.\n\n1:16:52.260 --> 1:16:53.860\n It seems to be superstitious to me,\n\n1:16:53.860 --> 1:16:57.580\n basically beliefs that assert things\n\n1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:00.020\n for which no evidence exists\n\n1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.180\n are incompatible with sound epistemology.\n\n1:17:02.180 --> 1:17:04.620\n And I don't think that religion has to be superstitious,\n\n1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.860\n otherwise it should be condemned in all cases.\n\n1:17:06.860 --> 1:17:09.140\n You're somebody who's saying we live in a dream world,\n\n1:17:09.140 --> 1:17:11.340\n we have zero evidence for anything.\n\n1:17:11.340 --> 1:17:12.180\n So...\n\n1:17:12.180 --> 1:17:13.500\n That's not the case.\n\n1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:16.060\n There are limits to what languages can be constructed.\n\n1:17:16.060 --> 1:17:19.500\n Mathematics brings solid evidence for its own structure.\n\n1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:23.260\n And once we have some idea of what languages exist\n\n1:17:23.260 --> 1:17:24.460\n and how a system can learn\n\n1:17:24.460 --> 1:17:26.580\n and what learning itself is in the first place.\n\n1:17:26.580 --> 1:17:31.580\n And so we can begin to realize that our intuitions\n\n1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:34.620\n that we are able to learn about the regularities\n\n1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:36.300\n of the world and minimize surprise\n\n1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:38.900\n and understand the nature of our own agency\n\n1:17:38.900 --> 1:17:40.660\n to some degree of abstraction.\n\n1:17:40.660 --> 1:17:42.140\n That's not an illusion.\n\n1:17:42.140 --> 1:17:44.140\n So it's a useful approximation.\n\n1:17:44.140 --> 1:17:46.860\n Just because we live in a dream world\n\n1:17:46.860 --> 1:17:51.780\n doesn't mean mathematics can't give us a consistent glimpse\n\n1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:54.940\n of physical, of objective reality.\n\n1:17:54.940 --> 1:17:57.340\n We can basically distinguish useful encodings\n\n1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:58.980\n from useless encodings.\n\n1:17:58.980 --> 1:18:03.460\n And when we apply our truth seeking to the world,\n\n1:18:03.460 --> 1:18:05.460\n we know we usually cannot find out\n\n1:18:05.460 --> 1:18:07.460\n whether a certain thing is true.\n\n1:18:07.460 --> 1:18:10.060\n What we typically do is we take the state vector\n\n1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.100\n of the universe separated into separate objects\n\n1:18:12.100 --> 1:18:14.420\n that interact with each other through interfaces.\n\n1:18:14.420 --> 1:18:16.180\n And this distinction that we are making\n\n1:18:16.180 --> 1:18:17.420\n is not completely arbitrary.\n\n1:18:17.420 --> 1:18:21.140\n It's done to optimize the compression\n\n1:18:21.140 --> 1:18:23.380\n that we can apply to our models of the universe.\n\n1:18:23.380 --> 1:18:25.660\n So we can predict what's happening\n\n1:18:25.660 --> 1:18:27.300\n with our limited resources.\n\n1:18:27.300 --> 1:18:29.220\n In this sense, it's not arbitrary.\n\n1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:32.020\n But the separation of the world into objects\n\n1:18:32.020 --> 1:18:34.940\n that are somehow discrete and interacting with each other\n\n1:18:34.940 --> 1:18:36.900\n is not the true reality, right?\n\n1:18:36.900 --> 1:18:38.420\n The boundaries between the objects\n\n1:18:38.420 --> 1:18:41.660\n are projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected.\n\n1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:44.020\n But still, it's only an approximation\n\n1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:46.460\n of what's actually the case.\n\n1:18:46.460 --> 1:18:48.980\n And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions\n\n1:18:48.980 --> 1:18:50.980\n when we try to understand high level things\n\n1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:53.100\n like economic aspects of the world\n\n1:18:53.100 --> 1:18:56.980\n and so on, or political aspects, or psychological aspects\n\n1:18:56.980 --> 1:18:58.300\n where we make simplifications.\n\n1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:00.780\n And the objects that we are using to separate the world\n\n1:19:00.780 --> 1:19:03.100\n are just one of many possible projections\n\n1:19:03.100 --> 1:19:04.820\n of what's going on.\n\n1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:07.180\n So it's not, in this postmodernist sense,\n\n1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:09.260\n completely arbitrary, and you're free to pick\n\n1:19:09.260 --> 1:19:11.100\n what you want or dismiss what you don't like\n\n1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:12.260\n because it's all stories.\n\n1:19:12.260 --> 1:19:13.660\n No, that's not true.\n\n1:19:13.660 --> 1:19:15.380\n You have to show for every model\n\n1:19:15.380 --> 1:19:17.340\n of how well it predicts the world.\n\n1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:19.220\n So the confidence that you should have\n\n1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:21.020\n in the entities of your models\n\n1:19:21.020 --> 1:19:23.420\n should correspond to the evidence that you have.\n\n1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:26.380\n Can I ask you on a small tangent\n\n1:19:27.660 --> 1:19:32.660\n to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people,\n\n1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:34.220\n which is postmodernism.\n\n1:19:35.180 --> 1:19:36.020\n What?\n\n1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:39.980\n What is postmodernism?\n\n1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:40.980\n How would you define it?\n\n1:19:40.980 --> 1:19:45.980\n And why to you is it not a useful framework of thought?\n\n1:19:48.860 --> 1:19:52.340\n Postmodernism is something that I'm really not an expert on.\n\n1:19:52.340 --> 1:19:57.340\n And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas\n\n1:19:57.340 --> 1:19:58.980\n that is difficult to lump together,\n\n1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:01.980\n that is characterized by some useful thinkers,\n\n1:20:01.980 --> 1:20:04.180\n some of them poststructuralists and so on.\n\n1:20:04.180 --> 1:20:05.740\n And I'm mostly not interested in it\n\n1:20:05.740 --> 1:20:08.660\n because I think that it's not leading me anywhere\n\n1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:11.340\n that I find particularly useful.\n\n1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:13.820\n It's mostly, I think, born out of the insight\n\n1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:17.380\n that the ontologies that we impose on the world\n\n1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:18.780\n are not literally true.\n\n1:20:18.780 --> 1:20:20.980\n And that we can often get to a different interpretation\n\n1:20:20.980 --> 1:20:22.780\n by the world by using a different ontology\n\n1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:25.060\n that is different separation of the world\n\n1:20:25.060 --> 1:20:26.540\n into interacting objects.\n\n1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:30.860\n But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories\n\n1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:33.180\n that are arbitrary, I think, is wrong.\n\n1:20:33.180 --> 1:20:37.540\n And the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy\n\n1:20:37.540 --> 1:20:40.900\n are working in an area that I largely don't find productive.\n\n1:20:40.900 --> 1:20:43.060\n There's nothing useful coming out of this.\n\n1:20:43.060 --> 1:20:45.060\n So this idea that truth is relative\n\n1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:46.980\n is not something that has, in some sense,\n\n1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:49.620\n informed physics or theory of relativity.\n\n1:20:49.620 --> 1:20:51.540\n And there is no feedback between those.\n\n1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:54.020\n There is no meaningful information\n\n1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:56.860\n of this type of philosophy on the sciences\n\n1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:59.340\n or on engineering or in politics.\n\n1:20:59.340 --> 1:21:04.820\n But there is a very strong information on ideology\n\n1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:07.620\n because it basically has become an ideology\n\n1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:11.100\n that is justifying itself by the notion\n\n1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:13.420\n that truth is a relative concept.\n\n1:21:13.420 --> 1:21:15.620\n And it's not being used in such a way\n\n1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:18.540\n that the philosophers or sociologists\n\n1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:20.340\n that take up these ideas say,\n\n1:21:20.340 --> 1:21:24.140\n oh, I should doubt my own ideas because maybe my separation of the world\n\n1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:25.740\n into objects is not completely valid.\n\n1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:27.580\n And I should maybe use a different one\n\n1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:30.460\n and be open to a pluralism of ideas.\n\n1:21:30.460 --> 1:21:34.300\n But it mostly exists to dismiss the ideas of other people.\n\n1:21:34.300 --> 1:21:37.540\n It becomes, yeah, it becomes a political weapon of sorts\n\n1:21:37.540 --> 1:21:39.220\n to achieve power.\n\n1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:42.580\n Basically, there's nothing wrong, I think,\n\n1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:46.060\n with developing a philosophy around this.\n\n1:21:46.060 --> 1:21:49.180\n But to develop a philosophy around this,\n\n1:21:49.180 --> 1:21:51.820\n to develop norms around the idea\n\n1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:54.940\n that truth is something that is completely negotiable,\n\n1:21:54.940 --> 1:21:57.860\n is incompatible with the scientific project.\n\n1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:02.140\n And I think if the academia has no defense\n\n1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:06.740\n against the ideological parts of the postmodernist movement,\n\n1:22:06.740 --> 1:22:07.860\n it's doomed.\n\n1:22:07.860 --> 1:22:11.740\n Right, you have to acknowledge the ideological part\n\n1:22:11.740 --> 1:22:15.260\n of any movement, actually, including postmodernism.\n\n1:22:15.260 --> 1:22:17.500\n Well, the question is what an ideology is.\n\n1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:21.060\n And to me, an ideology is basically a viral memeplex\n\n1:22:21.060 --> 1:22:25.980\n that is changing your mind in such a way that reality gets warped.\n\n1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:28.180\n It gets warped in such a way that you're being cut off\n\n1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:29.540\n from the rest of human thought space.\n\n1:22:29.540 --> 1:22:33.420\n And you cannot consider things outside of the range of ideas\n\n1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:35.780\n of your own ideology as possibly true.\n\n1:22:35.780 --> 1:22:38.380\n Right, so, I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology\n\n1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:39.340\n that make it harmful.\n\n1:22:39.340 --> 1:22:44.060\n One of them is that dogmatism of just certainty,\n\n1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:46.660\n dogged certainty in that you're right,\n\n1:22:46.660 --> 1:22:48.780\n you have the truth, and nobody else does.\n\n1:22:48.780 --> 1:22:50.220\n Yeah, but what is creating the certainty?\n\n1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:53.060\n It's very interesting to look at the type of model\n\n1:22:53.060 --> 1:22:54.100\n that is being produced.\n\n1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:57.500\n Is it basically just a strong prior, and you tell people,\n\n1:22:57.500 --> 1:22:59.980\n oh, this idea that you consider to be very true,\n\n1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:02.220\n the evidence for this is actually just much weaker\n\n1:23:02.220 --> 1:23:04.380\n than you thought, and look, here are some studies.\n\n1:23:04.380 --> 1:23:06.100\n No, this is not how it works.\n\n1:23:06.100 --> 1:23:09.260\n It's usually normative, which means some thoughts\n\n1:23:09.260 --> 1:23:13.780\n are unthinkable because they would change your identity\n\n1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:17.100\n into something that is no longer acceptable.\n\n1:23:17.100 --> 1:23:20.100\n And this cuts you off from considering an alternative.\n\n1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:23.220\n And many de facto religions use this trick\n\n1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:25.700\n to lock people into a certain mode of thought,\n\n1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:27.700\n and this removes agency over your own thoughts.\n\n1:23:27.700 --> 1:23:28.660\n And it's very ugly to me.\n\n1:23:28.660 --> 1:23:32.580\n It's basically not just a process of domestication,\n\n1:23:32.580 --> 1:23:35.180\n but it's actually an intellectual castration\n\n1:23:35.180 --> 1:23:36.220\n that happens.\n\n1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:39.140\n It's an inability to think creatively\n\n1:23:39.140 --> 1:23:40.820\n and to bring forth new thoughts.\n\n1:23:40.820 --> 1:23:45.820\n I can ask you about substances, chemical substances\n\n1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:53.140\n that affect the video game, the dream world.\n\n1:23:53.140 --> 1:23:57.140\n So psychedelics that increasingly have been getting\n\n1:23:57.140 --> 1:23:58.820\n a lot of research done on them.\n\n1:23:58.820 --> 1:24:02.620\n So in general, psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA,\n\n1:24:02.620 --> 1:24:06.300\n but also a really interesting one, the big one, which is DMT.\n\n1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:10.820\n What and where are the places that these substances\n\n1:24:10.820 --> 1:24:15.380\n take the mind that is operating in the dream world?\n\n1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:20.340\n Do you have an interesting sense how this throws a wrinkle\n\n1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:22.260\n into the prediction model?\n\n1:24:22.260 --> 1:24:24.500\n Is it just some weird little quirk\n\n1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:27.820\n or is there some fundamental expansion\n\n1:24:27.820 --> 1:24:28.940\n of the mind going on?\n\n1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:34.140\n I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics\n\n1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:36.420\n is that they induce particular types\n\n1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:38.540\n of lucid dreaming states.\n\n1:24:38.540 --> 1:24:41.620\n So it's a state in which certain connections\n\n1:24:41.620 --> 1:24:43.820\n are being severed in your mind.\n\n1:24:43.820 --> 1:24:45.340\n They're no longer active.\n\n1:24:45.340 --> 1:24:48.860\n Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction\n\n1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:51.060\n because some inhibition, some particular inhibition\n\n1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:52.740\n doesn't work anymore.\n\n1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:55.340\n And as a result, you might stop having a self\n\n1:24:55.340 --> 1:25:00.340\n or you might stop perceiving the world as three dimensional.\n\n1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:04.500\n And you can explore that state.\n\n1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:06.780\n And I suppose that for every state\n\n1:25:06.780 --> 1:25:08.300\n that can be induced with psychedelics,\n\n1:25:08.300 --> 1:25:10.980\n there are people that are naturally in that state.\n\n1:25:10.980 --> 1:25:13.340\n So sometimes psychedelics to shift you\n\n1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:15.860\n through a range of possible mental states.\n\n1:25:15.860 --> 1:25:17.820\n And they can also shift you out of the range\n\n1:25:17.820 --> 1:25:19.100\n of permissible mental states\n\n1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:22.620\n that is where you can make predictive models of reality.\n\n1:25:22.620 --> 1:25:26.980\n And what I observe in people that use psychedelics a lot\n\n1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:29.580\n is that they tend to be overfitting.\n\n1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:34.540\n Overfitting means that you are using more bits\n\n1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:38.060\n for modeling the dynamics of a function than you should.\n\n1:25:38.060 --> 1:25:40.220\n And so you can fit your curve\n\n1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:42.780\n to extremely detailed things in the past,\n\n1:25:42.780 --> 1:25:45.860\n but this model is no longer predictive for the future.\n\n1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:48.460\n What is it about psychedelics that forces that?\n\n1:25:49.660 --> 1:25:51.060\n I thought it would be the opposite.\n\n1:25:51.060 --> 1:25:54.860\n I thought that it's a good mechanism\n\n1:25:54.860 --> 1:25:59.300\n for generalization, for regularization.\n\n1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:03.220\n So it feels like psychedelics expansion of the mind,\n\n1:26:03.220 --> 1:26:04.820\n like taking you outside of,\n\n1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:08.820\n like forcing your model to be non predictive\n\n1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:09.780\n is a good thing.\n\n1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:14.340\n Meaning like, it's almost like, okay,\n\n1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:16.700\n what I would say psychedelics are akin to\n\n1:26:16.700 --> 1:26:19.820\n is traveling to a totally different environment.\n\n1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:21.980\n Like going, if you've never been to like India\n\n1:26:21.980 --> 1:26:24.220\n or something like that from the United States,\n\n1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:26.180\n very different set of people, different culture,\n\n1:26:26.180 --> 1:26:30.340\n different food, different roads and values\n\n1:26:30.340 --> 1:26:31.420\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:33.540\n Yeah, so psychedelics can, for instance,\n\n1:26:33.540 --> 1:26:37.820\n teleport people into a universe that is hyperbolic,\n\n1:26:37.820 --> 1:26:41.300\n which means that if you imagine a room that you're in,\n\n1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:43.580\n you can turn around 360 degrees\n\n1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:44.660\n and you didn't go full circle.\n\n1:26:44.660 --> 1:26:47.180\n You need to go 720 degrees to go full circle.\n\n1:26:47.180 --> 1:26:48.020\n Exactly.\n\n1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:50.820\n So the things that people learn in that state\n\n1:26:50.820 --> 1:26:52.180\n cannot be easily transferred\n\n1:26:52.180 --> 1:26:54.260\n in this universe that we are in.\n\n1:26:54.260 --> 1:26:56.420\n It could be that if they're able to abstract\n\n1:26:56.420 --> 1:26:58.260\n and understand what happened to them,\n\n1:26:58.260 --> 1:27:00.300\n that they understand that some part\n\n1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:03.500\n of their spatial cognition has been desynchronized\n\n1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:05.660\n and has found a different synchronization.\n\n1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:06.900\n And this different synchronization\n\n1:27:06.900 --> 1:27:08.620\n happens to be a hyperbolic one, right?\n\n1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:10.980\n So you learn something interesting about your brain.\n\n1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:13.140\n It's difficult to understand what exactly happened,\n\n1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:14.580\n but we get a pretty good idea\n\n1:27:14.580 --> 1:27:17.700\n once we understand how the brain is representing geometry.\n\n1:27:17.700 --> 1:27:20.180\n Yeah, but doesn't it give you a fresh perspective\n\n1:27:20.180 --> 1:27:26.060\n on the physical reality?\n\n1:27:26.060 --> 1:27:27.780\n Who's making that sound?\n\n1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:30.980\n Is it inside my head or is it external?\n\n1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:33.180\n Well, there is no sound outside of your mind,\n\n1:27:33.180 --> 1:27:39.660\n but it's making sense of phenomenon physics.\n\n1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:44.780\n Yeah, in the physical reality, there's sound waves\n\n1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:45.860\n traveling through air.\n\n1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:47.020\n Okay.\n\n1:27:47.020 --> 1:27:48.580\n That's our model of what happened.\n\n1:27:48.580 --> 1:27:53.380\n That's our model of what happened, right.\n\n1:27:53.380 --> 1:27:57.220\n Doesn't Psychedelics give you a fresh perspective\n\n1:27:57.220 --> 1:27:59.100\n on this physical reality?\n\n1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:05.980\n Like, not this physical reality, but this more...\n\n1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:09.780\n What do you call the dream world that's mapped directly to...\n\n1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:11.580\n The purpose of dreaming at night, I think,\n\n1:28:11.580 --> 1:28:13.660\n is data augmentation.\n\n1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:14.900\n Exactly.\n\n1:28:14.900 --> 1:28:16.300\n So that's very different.\n\n1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:18.780\n That's very similar to Psychedelics.\n\n1:28:18.780 --> 1:28:21.660\n It's changed parameters about the things that you have learned.\n\n1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:24.140\n And, for instance, when you are young,\n\n1:28:24.140 --> 1:28:26.060\n you have seen things from certain perspectives,\n\n1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:27.300\n but not from others.\n\n1:28:27.300 --> 1:28:30.180\n So your brain is generating new perspectives of objects\n\n1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:31.540\n that you already know,\n\n1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:34.100\n which means you can learn to recognize them later\n\n1:28:34.100 --> 1:28:35.180\n from different perspectives.\n\n1:28:35.180 --> 1:28:37.660\n And I suspect that's the reason that many of us\n\n1:28:37.660 --> 1:28:39.700\n remember to have flying dreams as children,\n\n1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:41.700\n because it's just different perspectives of the world\n\n1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.020\n that you already know,\n\n1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:46.540\n and that it starts to generate these different\n\n1:28:46.540 --> 1:28:47.860\n perspective changes,\n\n1:28:47.860 --> 1:28:50.540\n and then it fluidly turns this into a flying dream\n\n1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:52.260\n to make sense of what's happening, right?\n\n1:28:52.260 --> 1:28:53.620\n So you fill in the gaps,\n\n1:28:53.620 --> 1:28:55.860\n and suddenly you see yourself flying.\n\n1:28:55.860 --> 1:28:58.820\n And similar things can happen with semantic relationships.\n\n1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:00.580\n So it's not just spatial relationships,\n\n1:29:00.580 --> 1:29:03.420\n but it can also be the relationships between ideas\n\n1:29:03.420 --> 1:29:05.180\n that are being changed.\n\n1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:08.140\n And it seems that the mechanisms that make that happen\n\n1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:12.060\n during dreaming are interacting\n\n1:29:12.060 --> 1:29:14.300\n with these same receptors\n\n1:29:14.300 --> 1:29:17.220\n that are being stimulated by psychedelics.\n\n1:29:17.220 --> 1:29:19.780\n So I suspect that there is a thing\n\n1:29:19.780 --> 1:29:22.020\n that I haven't read really about.\n\n1:29:22.020 --> 1:29:24.380\n The way in which dreams are induced in the brain\n\n1:29:24.380 --> 1:29:28.500\n is not just that the activity of the brain gets tuned down\n\n1:29:28.500 --> 1:29:30.620\n because your eyes are closed\n\n1:29:30.620 --> 1:29:33.980\n and you no longer get enough data from your eyes,\n\n1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:37.180\n but there is a particular type of neurotransmitter\n\n1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:40.140\n that is saturating your brain during these phases,\n\n1:29:40.140 --> 1:29:42.980\n during the REM phases, and you produce\n\n1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:44.740\n controlled hallucinations.\n\n1:29:44.740 --> 1:29:48.700\n And psychedelics are linking into these mechanisms,\n\n1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:49.860\n I suspect.\n\n1:29:49.860 --> 1:29:54.060\n So isn't that another trickier form of data augmentation?\n\n1:29:54.060 --> 1:29:57.740\n Yes, but it's also data augmentation\n\n1:29:57.740 --> 1:29:59.860\n that can happen outside of the specification\n\n1:29:59.860 --> 1:30:00.940\n that your brain is tuned to.\n\n1:30:00.940 --> 1:30:03.420\n So basically people are overclocking their brains\n\n1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:05.780\n and that produces states\n\n1:30:05.780 --> 1:30:09.260\n that are subjectively extremely interesting.\n\n1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:10.540\n Yeah, I just.\n\n1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:12.860\n But from the outside, very suspicious.\n\n1:30:12.860 --> 1:30:15.660\n So I think I'm over applying the metaphor\n\n1:30:15.660 --> 1:30:17.860\n of a neural network in my own mind,\n\n1:30:17.860 --> 1:30:22.460\n which I just think that doesn't lead to overfitting, right?\n\n1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:26.380\n But you were just sort of anecdotally saying\n\n1:30:26.380 --> 1:30:28.660\n my experiences with people that have done psychedelics\n\n1:30:28.660 --> 1:30:30.460\n are that kind of quality.\n\n1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:31.580\n I think it typically happens.\n\n1:30:31.580 --> 1:30:34.420\n So if you look at people like Timothy Leary,\n\n1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:36.700\n and he has written beautiful manifestos\n\n1:30:36.700 --> 1:30:40.220\n about the effect of LSD on people.\n\n1:30:40.220 --> 1:30:42.820\n He genuinely believed, he writes in these manifestos,\n\n1:30:42.820 --> 1:30:44.860\n that in the future, science and art\n\n1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:46.300\n will only be done on psychedelics\n\n1:30:46.300 --> 1:30:49.020\n because it's so much more efficient and so much better.\n\n1:30:49.020 --> 1:30:52.660\n And he gave LSD to children in this community\n\n1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:55.780\n of a few thousand people that he had near San Francisco.\n\n1:30:55.780 --> 1:31:00.540\n And basically he was losing touch with reality.\n\n1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:02.220\n He did not understand the effects\n\n1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:04.260\n that the things that he was doing\n\n1:31:04.260 --> 1:31:06.620\n would have on the reception of psychedelics\n\n1:31:06.620 --> 1:31:09.900\n by society because he was unable to think critically\n\n1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:10.740\n about what happened.\n\n1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:13.500\n What happened was that he got in a euphoric state,\n\n1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:16.620\n that euphoric state happened because he was overfitting.\n\n1:31:16.620 --> 1:31:19.460\n He was taking this sense of euphoria\n\n1:31:19.460 --> 1:31:21.500\n and translating it into a model\n\n1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:23.660\n of actual success in the world, right?\n\n1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:25.500\n He was feeling better.\n\n1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:26.940\n Limitations had disappeared,\n\n1:31:26.940 --> 1:31:29.580\n that he experienced to be existing,\n\n1:31:29.580 --> 1:31:30.740\n but he didn't get superpowers.\n\n1:31:30.740 --> 1:31:33.860\n I understand what you mean by overfitting now.\n\n1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:36.020\n There's a lot of interpretation to the term\n\n1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:38.660\n overfitting in this case, but I got you.\n\n1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:42.740\n So he was getting positive rewards\n\n1:31:42.740 --> 1:31:44.220\n from a lot of actions that he shouldn't have been doing.\n\n1:31:44.220 --> 1:31:45.060\n Yeah, but not just this.\n\n1:31:45.060 --> 1:31:46.620\n So if you take, for instance, John Lilly,\n\n1:31:46.620 --> 1:31:51.620\n who was studying dolphin languages and aliens and so on,\n\n1:31:52.140 --> 1:31:54.940\n a lot of people that use psychedelics became very loopy.\n\n1:31:55.900 --> 1:31:58.700\n And the typical thing that you notice\n\n1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:00.940\n when people are on psychedelics is that they are in a state\n\n1:32:00.940 --> 1:32:03.660\n where they feel that everything can be explained now.\n\n1:32:03.660 --> 1:32:06.620\n Everything is clear, everything is obvious.\n\n1:32:06.620 --> 1:32:09.660\n And sometimes they have indeed discovered\n\n1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:12.060\n a useful connection, but not always.\n\n1:32:12.060 --> 1:32:15.380\n Very often these connections are overinterpretations.\n\n1:32:15.380 --> 1:32:17.740\n I wonder, you know, there's a question\n\n1:32:17.740 --> 1:32:21.060\n of correlation versus causation.\n\n1:32:21.060 --> 1:32:23.340\n And also I wonder if it's the psychedelics\n\n1:32:23.340 --> 1:32:27.100\n or if it's more the social, like being the outsider\n\n1:32:28.580 --> 1:32:31.140\n and having a strong community of outside\n\n1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:34.300\n and having a leadership position in an outsider cult\n\n1:32:34.300 --> 1:32:37.420\n like community that could have a much stronger effect\n\n1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:39.940\n of overfitting than do psychedelics themselves,\n\n1:32:39.940 --> 1:32:43.340\n the actual substances, because it's a counterculture thing.\n\n1:32:43.340 --> 1:32:46.540\n So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance.\n\n1:32:46.540 --> 1:32:49.700\n If you're a boring person who wears a suit and tie\n\n1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:53.220\n and works at a bank and takes psychedelics,\n\n1:32:53.220 --> 1:32:55.140\n that could be a very different effect\n\n1:32:55.140 --> 1:32:57.820\n of psychedelics on your mind.\n\n1:32:57.820 --> 1:32:59.660\n I'm just sort of raising the point\n\n1:32:59.660 --> 1:33:02.860\n that the people you referenced are already weirdos.\n\n1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:04.180\n I'm not sure exactly.\n\n1:33:04.180 --> 1:33:05.220\n No, not necessarily.\n\n1:33:05.220 --> 1:33:07.540\n A lot of the people that tell me\n\n1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:10.980\n that they use psychedelics in a useful way\n\n1:33:10.980 --> 1:33:14.580\n started out as squares and were liberating themselves\n\n1:33:14.580 --> 1:33:16.060\n because they were stuck.\n\n1:33:16.060 --> 1:33:17.980\n They were basically stuck in local optimum\n\n1:33:17.980 --> 1:33:20.980\n of their own self model, of their relationship to the world.\n\n1:33:20.980 --> 1:33:23.180\n And suddenly they had data augmentation.\n\n1:33:23.180 --> 1:33:26.740\n They basically saw and experienced a space of possibilities.\n\n1:33:26.740 --> 1:33:29.540\n They experienced what it would be like to be another person.\n\n1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:32.260\n And they took important lessons\n\n1:33:32.260 --> 1:33:33.780\n from that experience back home.\n\n1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:40.660\n Yeah, I mean, I love the metaphor of data augmentation\n\n1:33:40.660 --> 1:33:44.900\n because that's been the primary driver\n\n1:33:44.900 --> 1:33:48.900\n of self supervised learning in the computer vision domain\n\n1:33:48.900 --> 1:33:50.100\n is data augmentation.\n\n1:33:50.100 --> 1:33:53.100\n So it's funny to think of data augmentation,\n\n1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:58.100\n like chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.\n\n1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:02.100\n There's also a very interesting effect that I noticed.\n\n1:34:02.100 --> 1:34:06.100\n I know several people who are sphere to me\n\n1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:09.780\n that LSD has cured their migraines.\n\n1:34:09.780 --> 1:34:13.060\n So severe cluster headaches or migraines\n\n1:34:13.060 --> 1:34:15.900\n that didn't respond to standard medication\n\n1:34:15.900 --> 1:34:18.220\n that disappeared after a single dose.\n\n1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:20.820\n And I don't recommend anybody doing this,\n\n1:34:20.820 --> 1:34:23.260\n especially not in the US where it's illegal.\n\n1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:26.340\n And there are no studies on this for that reason.\n\n1:34:26.340 --> 1:34:28.900\n But it seems that anecdotally\n\n1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:33.420\n that it basically can reset the serotonergic system.\n\n1:34:33.420 --> 1:34:36.380\n So it's basically pushing them\n\n1:34:36.380 --> 1:34:38.220\n outside of their normal boundaries.\n\n1:34:38.220 --> 1:34:41.020\n And as a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium.\n\n1:34:41.020 --> 1:34:43.300\n And in some people that equilibrium is better,\n\n1:34:43.300 --> 1:34:46.260\n but it also follows that in other people it might be worse.\n\n1:34:46.260 --> 1:34:49.500\n So if you have a brain that is already teetering\n\n1:34:49.500 --> 1:34:51.980\n on the boundary to psychosis,\n\n1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:54.740\n it can be permanently pushed over that boundary.\n\n1:34:54.740 --> 1:34:56.540\n Well, that's why you have to do good science,\n\n1:34:56.540 --> 1:34:58.340\n which they're starting to do on all these different\n\n1:34:58.340 --> 1:34:59.940\n substances of how well it actually works\n\n1:34:59.940 --> 1:35:02.660\n for the different conditions like MDMA seems to help\n\n1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:05.580\n with PTSD, same with psilocybin.\n\n1:35:05.580 --> 1:35:08.340\n You need to do good science,\n\n1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:10.860\n meaning large studies of large N.\n\n1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:14.060\n Yeah, so based on the existing studies of MDMA,\n\n1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:17.460\n it seems that if you look at Rick Doblin's work\n\n1:35:17.460 --> 1:35:20.780\n and what he has published about this and talks about,\n\n1:35:20.780 --> 1:35:24.180\n MDMA seems to be a psychologically relatively safe drug.\n\n1:35:24.180 --> 1:35:26.740\n But it's physiologically not very safe.\n\n1:35:26.740 --> 1:35:30.060\n That is, there is neurotoxicity\n\n1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:31.820\n if you would use a too large dose.\n\n1:35:31.820 --> 1:35:34.420\n And if you combine this with alcohol,\n\n1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:37.540\n which a lot of kids do in party settings during raves\n\n1:35:37.540 --> 1:35:40.260\n and so on, it's very hepatotoxic.\n\n1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:42.220\n So basically you can kill your liver.\n\n1:35:42.220 --> 1:35:45.340\n And this means that it's probably something that is best\n\n1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:48.340\n and most productively used in a clinical setting\n\n1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:50.020\n by people who really know what they're doing.\n\n1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:53.580\n And I suspect that's also true for the other psychedelics\n\n1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:56.620\n that is while the other psychedelics are probably not\n\n1:35:56.620 --> 1:35:59.460\n as toxic as say alcohol,\n\n1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:02.220\n the effects on the psyche can be much more profound\n\n1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:03.460\n and lasting.\n\n1:36:03.460 --> 1:36:05.940\n Yeah, well, as far as I know psilocybin,\n\n1:36:05.940 --> 1:36:09.020\n so mushrooms, magic mushrooms,\n\n1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:11.780\n as far as I know in terms of the studies they're running,\n\n1:36:11.780 --> 1:36:15.060\n I think have no, like they're allowed to do\n\n1:36:15.060 --> 1:36:17.060\n what they're calling heroic doses.\n\n1:36:17.060 --> 1:36:18.980\n So that one does not have a toxicity.\n\n1:36:18.980 --> 1:36:21.700\n So they could do like huge doses in a clinical setting\n\n1:36:21.700 --> 1:36:23.620\n when they're doing study on psilocybin,\n\n1:36:23.620 --> 1:36:25.140\n which is kind of fun.\n\n1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:27.100\n Yeah, it seems that most of the psychedelics\n\n1:36:27.100 --> 1:36:29.300\n work in extremely small doses,\n\n1:36:29.300 --> 1:36:32.180\n which means that the effect on the rest of the body\n\n1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:33.660\n is relatively low.\n\n1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:36.180\n And MDMA is probably the exception.\n\n1:36:36.180 --> 1:36:38.300\n Maybe ketamine can be dangerous in larger doses\n\n1:36:38.300 --> 1:36:41.260\n because it can depress breathing and so on.\n\n1:36:41.260 --> 1:36:45.940\n But the LSD and psilocybin work in very, very small doses,\n\n1:36:45.940 --> 1:36:47.820\n at least the active part of them,\n\n1:36:47.820 --> 1:36:50.580\n of psilocybin LSD is only the active part.\n\n1:36:50.580 --> 1:36:54.100\n And the, but the effect that it can have\n\n1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:57.060\n on your mental wiring can be very dangerous, I think.\n\n1:36:57.940 --> 1:36:59.620\n Let's talk about AI a little bit.\n\n1:37:00.540 --> 1:37:05.300\n What are your thoughts about GPT3 and language models\n\n1:37:05.300 --> 1:37:07.220\n trained with self supervised learning?\n\n1:37:09.980 --> 1:37:11.420\n It came out quite a bit ago,\n\n1:37:11.420 --> 1:37:13.180\n but I wanted to get your thoughts on it.\n\n1:37:13.180 --> 1:37:14.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:16.900\n In the nineties, I was in New Zealand\n\n1:37:16.900 --> 1:37:21.140\n and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten,\n\n1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:25.220\n who realized I was bored in class and put me in his lab.\n\n1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:28.780\n And he gave me the task to discover grammatical structure\n\n1:37:28.780 --> 1:37:30.100\n in an unknown language.\n\n1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:33.740\n And the unknown language that I picked was English\n\n1:37:33.740 --> 1:37:35.100\n because it was the easiest one\n\n1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:37.980\n to find a corpus for construct one.\n\n1:37:37.980 --> 1:37:41.980\n And he gave me the largest computer at the whole university.\n\n1:37:41.980 --> 1:37:44.140\n It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing.\n\n1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:45.380\n And I wrote everything in C\n\n1:37:45.380 --> 1:37:47.740\n with some in memory compression to do statistics\n\n1:37:47.740 --> 1:37:49.340\n over the language.\n\n1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:53.900\n And I first would create a dictionary of all the words,\n\n1:37:53.900 --> 1:37:57.300\n which basically tokenizes everything and compresses things\n\n1:37:57.300 --> 1:37:58.820\n so that I don't need to store the whole word,\n\n1:37:58.820 --> 1:38:02.300\n but just a code for every word.\n\n1:38:02.300 --> 1:38:05.900\n And then I was taking this all apart in sentences\n\n1:38:05.900 --> 1:38:09.140\n and I was trying to find all the relationships\n\n1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.860\n between all the words in the sentences\n\n1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:12.940\n and do statistics over them.\n\n1:38:12.940 --> 1:38:15.180\n And that proved to be impossible\n\n1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:18.020\n because the complexity is just too large.\n\n1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:20.460\n So if you want to discover the relationship\n\n1:38:20.460 --> 1:38:21.860\n between an article and a noun,\n\n1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:23.860\n and there are three adjectives in between,\n\n1:38:23.860 --> 1:38:25.420\n you cannot do ngram statistics\n\n1:38:25.420 --> 1:38:28.060\n and look at all the possibilities that can exist,\n\n1:38:28.060 --> 1:38:30.740\n at least not with the resources that we had back then.\n\n1:38:30.740 --> 1:38:33.300\n So I realized I need to make some statistics\n\n1:38:33.300 --> 1:38:35.220\n over what I need to make statistics over.\n\n1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:38.620\n So I wrote something that was pretty much a hack\n\n1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:42.380\n that did this for at least first order relationships.\n\n1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:45.100\n And I came up with some kind of mutual information graph\n\n1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:48.380\n that was indeed discovering something that looks exactly\n\n1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:50.500\n like the grammatical structure of the sentence,\n\n1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:52.660\n just by trying to encode the sentence\n\n1:38:52.660 --> 1:38:54.740\n in such a way that the words would be written\n\n1:38:54.740 --> 1:38:58.100\n in the optimal order inside of the model.\n\n1:38:58.100 --> 1:39:02.140\n And what I also found is that if we would be able\n\n1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:03.820\n to increase the resolution of that\n\n1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:06.620\n and not just use this model\n\n1:39:06.620 --> 1:39:09.060\n to reproduce grammatically correct sentences,\n\n1:39:09.060 --> 1:39:09.980\n we would also be able\n\n1:39:09.980 --> 1:39:12.020\n to correct stylistically correct sentences\n\n1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:14.580\n by just having more bits in these relationships.\n\n1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:16.300\n And if we wanted to have meaning,\n\n1:39:16.300 --> 1:39:18.740\n we would have to go much higher order.\n\n1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:21.460\n And I didn't know how to make higher order models back then\n\n1:39:21.460 --> 1:39:23.860\n without spending way more years in research\n\n1:39:23.860 --> 1:39:25.580\n on how to make the statistics\n\n1:39:25.580 --> 1:39:27.700\n over what we need to make statistics over.\n\n1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:31.540\n And this thing that we cannot look at the relationships\n\n1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:34.020\n between all the bits in your input is being solved\n\n1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:35.780\n in different domains in different ways.\n\n1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:39.380\n So in computer graphics, computer vision,\n\n1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:41.380\n standard methods for many years now\n\n1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:43.620\n is convolutional neural networks.\n\n1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:46.620\n Convolutional neural networks are hierarchies of filters\n\n1:39:46.620 --> 1:39:48.980\n that exploit the fact that neighboring pixels\n\n1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:51.100\n in images are usually semantically related\n\n1:39:51.100 --> 1:39:53.020\n and distance pixels in images\n\n1:39:53.020 --> 1:39:55.500\n are usually not semantically related.\n\n1:39:55.500 --> 1:39:57.700\n So you can just by grouping the pixels\n\n1:39:57.700 --> 1:39:59.100\n that are next to each other,\n\n1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:02.780\n hierarchically together reconstruct the shape of objects.\n\n1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:04.620\n And this is an important prior\n\n1:40:04.620 --> 1:40:06.140\n that we built into these models\n\n1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:08.460\n so they can converge quickly.\n\n1:40:08.460 --> 1:40:09.820\n But this doesn't work in language\n\n1:40:09.820 --> 1:40:12.940\n for the reason that adjacent words are often\n\n1:40:12.940 --> 1:40:14.980\n but not always related and distant words\n\n1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:18.060\n are sometimes related while the words in between are not.\n\n1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:22.660\n So how can you learn the topology of language?\n\n1:40:22.660 --> 1:40:26.460\n And I think for this reason that this difficulty existed,\n\n1:40:26.460 --> 1:40:28.700\n the transformer was invented\n\n1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:32.780\n in natural language processing, not in vision.\n\n1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.900\n And what the transformer is doing,\n\n1:40:34.900 --> 1:40:38.420\n it's a hierarchy of layers where every layer learns\n\n1:40:38.420 --> 1:40:40.900\n what to pay attention to in the given context\n\n1:40:40.900 --> 1:40:43.220\n in the previous layer.\n\n1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:45.180\n So what to make the statistics over.\n\n1:40:46.020 --> 1:40:49.980\n And the context is significantly larger\n\n1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:51.540\n than the adjacent word.\n\n1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:55.980\n Yes, so the context that GPT3 has been using,\n\n1:40:55.980 --> 1:40:58.500\n the transformer itself is from 2017\n\n1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:02.180\n and it wasn't using that large of a context.\n\n1:41:02.180 --> 1:41:05.060\n OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea\n\n1:41:05.060 --> 1:41:06.940\n as far as they could at the time.\n\n1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:11.300\n And the context is about 2048 symbols,\n\n1:41:11.300 --> 1:41:12.860\n tokens in the language.\n\n1:41:12.860 --> 1:41:15.060\n These symbols are not characters,\n\n1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:17.020\n but they take the words and project them\n\n1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:20.100\n into a vector space where words\n\n1:41:20.100 --> 1:41:22.020\n that are statistically co occurring a lot\n\n1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.220\n are neighbors already.\n\n1:41:23.220 --> 1:41:24.780\n So it's already a simplification\n\n1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:26.580\n of the problem a little bit.\n\n1:41:26.580 --> 1:41:29.260\n And so every word is basically a set of coordinates\n\n1:41:29.260 --> 1:41:31.060\n in a high dimensional space.\n\n1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:33.100\n And then they use some kind of trick\n\n1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:36.340\n to also encode the order of the words in a sentence\n\n1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:37.820\n or in the not just sentence,\n\n1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:41.780\n but 2048 tokens is about a couple of pages of text\n\n1:41:41.780 --> 1:41:43.620\n or two and a half pages of text.\n\n1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:46.860\n And so they managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics\n\n1:41:46.860 --> 1:41:49.140\n over the potential relationships\n\n1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:51.740\n between two pages of text, which is tremendous.\n\n1:41:51.740 --> 1:41:55.020\n I was just using a single sentence back then.\n\n1:41:55.020 --> 1:41:58.780\n And I was only looking for first order relationships.\n\n1:41:58.780 --> 1:42:00.380\n And they were really looking\n\n1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:02.740\n for much, much higher level relationships.\n\n1:42:02.740 --> 1:42:05.300\n And what they discover after they fed this\n\n1:42:05.300 --> 1:42:06.580\n with an enormous amount of training,\n\n1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:08.980\n they are pretty much the written internet\n\n1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:12.140\n or a subset of it that had some quality,\n\n1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:15.180\n but substantial portion of the common core\n\n1:42:15.180 --> 1:42:18.180\n that they're not only able to reproduce style,\n\n1:42:18.180 --> 1:42:19.860\n but they're also able to reproduce\n\n1:42:19.860 --> 1:42:21.660\n some pretty detailed semantics,\n\n1:42:21.660 --> 1:42:24.700\n like being able to add three digit numbers\n\n1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:26.220\n and multiply two digit numbers\n\n1:42:26.220 --> 1:42:28.820\n or to translate between programming languages\n\n1:42:28.820 --> 1:42:30.220\n and things like that.\n\n1:42:30.220 --> 1:42:34.060\n So the results that GPT3 got, I think were amazing.\n\n1:42:34.060 --> 1:42:38.620\n By the way, I actually didn't check carefully.\n\n1:42:38.620 --> 1:42:40.540\n It's funny you just mentioned\n\n1:42:40.540 --> 1:42:42.940\n how you coupled semantics to the multiplication.\n\n1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:46.700\n Is it able to do some basic math on two digit numbers?\n\n1:42:46.700 --> 1:42:47.940\n Yes.\n\n1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:48.820\n Okay, interesting.\n\n1:42:48.820 --> 1:42:53.100\n I thought there's a lot of failure cases.\n\n1:42:53.100 --> 1:42:56.140\n Yeah, it basically fails if you take larger digit numbers.\n\n1:42:56.140 --> 1:42:59.780\n So four digit numbers and so on makes carrying mistakes\n\n1:42:59.780 --> 1:43:00.620\n and so on.\n\n1:43:00.620 --> 1:43:02.580\n And if you take larger numbers,\n\n1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:04.980\n you don't get useful results at all.\n\n1:43:04.980 --> 1:43:09.260\n And this could be an issue of the training set\n\n1:43:09.260 --> 1:43:10.940\n where there are not many examples\n\n1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:13.300\n of successful long form addition\n\n1:43:13.300 --> 1:43:15.300\n and standard human written text.\n\n1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:16.780\n And humans aren't very good\n\n1:43:16.780 --> 1:43:19.460\n at doing three digit numbers either.\n\n1:43:19.460 --> 1:43:22.340\n Yeah, you're not writing a lot about it.\n\n1:43:22.340 --> 1:43:24.740\n And the other thing is that the loss function\n\n1:43:24.740 --> 1:43:27.020\n that is being used is only minimizing surprise.\n\n1:43:27.020 --> 1:43:29.580\n So it's predicting what comes next in the typical text.\n\n1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:32.260\n It's not trying to go for causal closure first\n\n1:43:32.260 --> 1:43:33.100\n as we do.\n\n1:43:33.100 --> 1:43:33.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:35.100 --> 1:43:39.620\n But the fact that that kind of prediction works\n\n1:43:39.620 --> 1:43:42.740\n to generate text that's semantically rich\n\n1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:45.020\n and consistent is interesting.\n\n1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:45.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:47.220\n So yeah, so it's amazing that it's able\n\n1:43:47.220 --> 1:43:50.780\n to generate semantically consistent text.\n\n1:43:50.780 --> 1:43:51.940\n It's not consistent.\n\n1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:54.660\n So the problem is that it loses coherence at some point,\n\n1:43:54.660 --> 1:43:57.140\n but it's also, I think, not correct to say\n\n1:43:57.140 --> 1:44:01.340\n that GPT3 is unable to deal with semantics at all\n\n1:44:01.340 --> 1:44:04.100\n because you ask it to perform certain transformations\n\n1:44:04.100 --> 1:44:07.220\n in text and it performs these transformation in text.\n\n1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:09.220\n And the kind of additions that it's able\n\n1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:12.540\n to perform are transformations in text, right?\n\n1:44:12.540 --> 1:44:15.340\n And there are proper semantics involved.\n\n1:44:15.340 --> 1:44:16.420\n You can also do more.\n\n1:44:16.420 --> 1:44:19.900\n There was a paper that was generating lots\n\n1:44:19.900 --> 1:44:24.180\n and lots of mathematically correct text\n\n1:44:24.180 --> 1:44:26.340\n and was feeding this into a transformer.\n\n1:44:26.340 --> 1:44:29.340\n And as a result, it was able to learn\n\n1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:32.460\n how to do differentiation integration in race\n\n1:44:32.460 --> 1:44:35.100\n that according to the authors, Mathematica could not.\n\n1:44:37.340 --> 1:44:39.860\n To which some of the people in Mathematica responded\n\n1:44:39.860 --> 1:44:42.700\n that they were not using Mathematica in the right way\n\n1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:43.540\n and so on.\n\n1:44:43.540 --> 1:44:46.380\n I have not really followed the resolution of this conflict.\n\n1:44:46.380 --> 1:44:48.700\n This part, as a small tangent,\n\n1:44:48.700 --> 1:44:51.500\n I really don't like in machine learning papers,\n\n1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:56.500\n which they often do anecdotal evidence.\n\n1:44:56.620 --> 1:44:58.300\n They'll find like one example\n\n1:44:58.300 --> 1:45:00.460\n in some kind of specific use of Mathematica\n\n1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:01.940\n and demonstrate, look, here's,\n\n1:45:01.940 --> 1:45:04.140\n they'll show successes and failures,\n\n1:45:04.140 --> 1:45:07.660\n but they won't have a very clear representation\n\n1:45:07.660 --> 1:45:09.380\n of how many cases this actually represents.\n\n1:45:09.380 --> 1:45:11.260\n Yes, but I think as a first paper,\n\n1:45:11.260 --> 1:45:12.660\n this is a pretty good start.\n\n1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:15.460\n And so the take home message, I think,\n\n1:45:15.460 --> 1:45:19.420\n is that the authors could get better results\n\n1:45:19.420 --> 1:45:21.540\n from this in their experiments\n\n1:45:21.540 --> 1:45:23.460\n than they could get from the vein,\n\n1:45:23.460 --> 1:45:25.940\n which they were using computer algebra systems,\n\n1:45:25.940 --> 1:45:29.100\n which means that was not nothing.\n\n1:45:29.100 --> 1:45:32.340\n And it's able to perform substantially better\n\n1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:35.660\n than GPT's V can based on a much larger amount\n\n1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:38.980\n of training data using the same underlying algorithm.\n\n1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:41.300\n Well, let me ask, again,\n\n1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:44.860\n so I'm using your tweets as if this is like Plato, right?\n\n1:45:47.060 --> 1:45:51.780\n As if this is well thought out novels that you've written.\n\n1:45:51.780 --> 1:45:55.820\n You tweeted, GPT4 is listening to us now.\n\n1:45:58.660 --> 1:46:00.300\n This is one way of asking,\n\n1:46:00.300 --> 1:46:04.220\n what are the limitations of GPT3 when it scales?\n\n1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:06.500\n So what do you think will be the capabilities\n\n1:46:06.500 --> 1:46:10.260\n of GPT4, GPT5, and so on?\n\n1:46:10.260 --> 1:46:11.780\n What are the limits of this approach?\n\n1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:15.100\n So obviously when we are writing things right now,\n\n1:46:15.100 --> 1:46:16.460\n everything that we are writing now\n\n1:46:16.460 --> 1:46:18.020\n is going to be training data\n\n1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:20.100\n for the next generation of machine learning models.\n\n1:46:20.100 --> 1:46:23.100\n So yes, of course, GPT4 is listening to us.\n\n1:46:23.100 --> 1:46:25.620\n And I think the tweet is already a little bit older\n\n1:46:25.620 --> 1:46:27.500\n and we now have Voodao\n\n1:46:27.500 --> 1:46:30.140\n and we have a number of other systems\n\n1:46:30.140 --> 1:46:33.620\n that basically are placeholders for GPT4.\n\n1:46:33.620 --> 1:46:35.980\n Don't know what open AIS plans are in this regard.\n\n1:46:35.980 --> 1:46:39.060\n I read that tweet in several ways.\n\n1:46:39.060 --> 1:46:42.700\n So one is obviously everything you put on the internet\n\n1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:44.660\n is used as training data.\n\n1:46:44.660 --> 1:46:49.580\n But in a second way I read it is in a,\n\n1:46:49.580 --> 1:46:51.620\n we talked about agency.\n\n1:46:51.620 --> 1:46:55.460\n I read it as almost like GPT4 is intelligent enough\n\n1:46:55.460 --> 1:46:58.260\n to be choosing to listen.\n\n1:46:58.260 --> 1:47:00.460\n So not only like did a programmer tell it\n\n1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:03.700\n to collect this data and use it for training,\n\n1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:06.220\n I almost saw the humorous angle,\n\n1:47:06.220 --> 1:47:09.100\n which is like it has achieved AGI kind of thing.\n\n1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:13.300\n Well, the thing is, could we be already be living in GPT5?\n\n1:47:13.300 --> 1:47:18.300\n So GPT4 is listening and GPT5 actually constructing\n\n1:47:18.300 --> 1:47:20.420\n the entirety of the reality where we...\n\n1:47:20.420 --> 1:47:22.340\n Of course, in some sense,\n\n1:47:22.340 --> 1:47:24.500\n what everybody is trying to do right now in AI\n\n1:47:24.500 --> 1:47:27.540\n is to extend the transformer to be able to deal with video.\n\n1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:31.860\n And there are very promising extensions, right?\n\n1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:36.060\n There's a work by Google that is called Perceiver\n\n1:47:36.060 --> 1:47:39.300\n and that is overcoming some of the limitations\n\n1:47:39.300 --> 1:47:41.980\n of the transformer by letting it learn the topology\n\n1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:44.900\n of the different modalities separately.\n\n1:47:44.900 --> 1:47:49.900\n And by training it to find better input features.\n\n1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:52.540\n So basically feature abstractions that are being used\n\n1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:57.540\n by this successor to GPT3 are chosen such a way\n\n1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:00.780\n that it's able to deal with video input.\n\n1:48:00.780 --> 1:48:02.220\n And there is more to be done.\n\n1:48:02.220 --> 1:48:07.220\n So one of the limitations of GPT3 is that it's amnesiac.\n\n1:48:07.820 --> 1:48:09.980\n So it forgets everything beyond the two pages\n\n1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:12.340\n that it currently reads also during generation,\n\n1:48:12.340 --> 1:48:14.420\n not just during learning.\n\n1:48:14.420 --> 1:48:16.580\n Do you think that's fixable\n\n1:48:16.580 --> 1:48:18.700\n within the space of deep learning?\n\n1:48:18.700 --> 1:48:21.340\n Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?\n\n1:48:21.340 --> 1:48:24.500\n No, I don't think that our own working memory\n\n1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:25.620\n is infinitely large.\n\n1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:28.020\n It's probably also just a few thousand bits.\n\n1:48:28.020 --> 1:48:31.060\n But what you can do is you can structure\n\n1:48:31.060 --> 1:48:31.900\n this working memory.\n\n1:48:31.900 --> 1:48:34.980\n So instead of just force feeding this thing,\n\n1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:37.060\n a certain thing that it has to focus on,\n\n1:48:37.060 --> 1:48:39.460\n and it's not allowed to focus on anything else\n\n1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:41.100\n as its network,\n\n1:48:41.100 --> 1:48:44.860\n you allow it to construct its own working memory as we do.\n\n1:48:44.860 --> 1:48:46.780\n When we are reading a book,\n\n1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:48.700\n it's not that we are focusing our attention\n\n1:48:48.700 --> 1:48:52.380\n in such a way that we can only remember the current page.\n\n1:48:52.380 --> 1:48:54.660\n We will also try to remember other pages\n\n1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:56.860\n and try to undo what we learned from them\n\n1:48:56.860 --> 1:48:58.660\n or modify what we learned from them.\n\n1:48:58.660 --> 1:49:01.020\n We might get up and take another book from the shelf.\n\n1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:03.060\n We might go out and ask somebody,\n\n1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:06.860\n we can edit our working memory in any way that is useful\n\n1:49:06.860 --> 1:49:09.260\n to put a context together that allows us\n\n1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:13.100\n to draw the right inferences and to learn the right things.\n\n1:49:13.100 --> 1:49:16.380\n So this ability to perform experiments on the world\n\n1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:20.420\n based on an attempt to become fully coherent\n\n1:49:20.420 --> 1:49:22.260\n and to achieve causal closure,\n\n1:49:22.260 --> 1:49:24.860\n to achieve a certain aesthetic of your modeling,\n\n1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:28.300\n that is something that eventually needs to be done.\n\n1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:31.140\n And at the moment we are skirting this in some sense\n\n1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:33.420\n by building systems that are larger and faster\n\n1:49:33.420 --> 1:49:36.100\n so they can use dramatically larger resources\n\n1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:38.700\n and human beings can do and much more training data\n\n1:49:38.700 --> 1:49:40.420\n to get to models that in some sense\n\n1:49:40.420 --> 1:49:42.380\n are already way superhuman\n\n1:49:42.380 --> 1:49:45.500\n and in other ways are laughingly incoherent.\n\n1:49:45.500 --> 1:49:50.060\n So do you think sort of making the systems like,\n\n1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:51.900\n what would you say, multi resolutional?\n\n1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:56.900\n So like some of the language models\n\n1:49:56.980 --> 1:49:59.820\n are focused on two pages,\n\n1:49:59.820 --> 1:50:03.380\n some are focused on two books,\n\n1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:06.580\n some are focused on two years of reading,\n\n1:50:06.580 --> 1:50:08.100\n some are focused on a lifetime,\n\n1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:11.900\n so it's like stacks of GPT3s all the way down.\n\n1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:13.700\n You want to have gaps in between them.\n\n1:50:13.700 --> 1:50:17.060\n So it's not necessarily two years, there's no gaps.\n\n1:50:17.060 --> 1:50:19.980\n It's things out of two years or out of 20 years\n\n1:50:19.980 --> 1:50:22.220\n or 2,000 years or 2 billion years\n\n1:50:22.220 --> 1:50:24.580\n where you are just selecting those bits\n\n1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:27.540\n that are predicted to be the most useful ones\n\n1:50:27.540 --> 1:50:29.700\n to understand what you're currently doing.\n\n1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:32.780\n And this prediction itself requires a very complicated model\n\n1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:34.780\n and that's the actual model that you need to be making.\n\n1:50:34.780 --> 1:50:36.940\n It's not just that you are trying to understand\n\n1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:38.340\n the relationships between things,\n\n1:50:38.340 --> 1:50:40.740\n but what you need to make relationships,\n\n1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:42.540\n discover relationships over.\n\n1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:45.500\n I wonder what that thing looks like,\n\n1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:47.820\n what the architecture for the thing\n\n1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:50.100\n that's able to have that kind of model.\n\n1:50:50.100 --> 1:50:52.460\n I think it needs more degrees of freedom\n\n1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:54.300\n than the current models have.\n\n1:50:54.300 --> 1:50:57.420\n So it starts out with the fact that you possibly\n\n1:50:57.420 --> 1:50:59.700\n don't just want to have a feed forward model,\n\n1:50:59.700 --> 1:51:02.700\n but you want it to be fully recurrent.\n\n1:51:02.700 --> 1:51:04.540\n And to make it fully recurrent,\n\n1:51:04.540 --> 1:51:06.660\n you probably need to loop it back into itself\n\n1:51:06.660 --> 1:51:08.220\n and allow it to skip connections.\n\n1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:09.980\n Once you do this,\n\n1:51:09.980 --> 1:51:12.020\n when you're predicting the next frame\n\n1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:15.180\n and your internal next frame in every moment,\n\n1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:17.500\n and you are able to skip connection,\n\n1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:21.300\n it means that signals can travel from the output\n\n1:51:21.300 --> 1:51:24.300\n of the network into the middle of the network\n\n1:51:24.300 --> 1:51:25.900\n faster than the inputs do.\n\n1:51:25.900 --> 1:51:28.780\n Do you think it can still be differentiable?\n\n1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:30.660\n Do you think it still can be a neural network?\n\n1:51:30.660 --> 1:51:32.980\n Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot.\n\n1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:35.500\n So it can still be a neural network,\n\n1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:37.180\n but not a fully differentiable one.\n\n1:51:37.180 --> 1:51:40.900\n And when you want to deal with non differentiable ones,\n\n1:51:40.900 --> 1:51:42.780\n you need to have an attention system\n\n1:51:42.780 --> 1:51:44.780\n that is discreet and two dimensional\n\n1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:46.660\n and can perform grammatical operations.\n\n1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:49.300\n You need to be able to perform program synthesis.\n\n1:51:49.300 --> 1:51:51.220\n You need to be able to backtrack\n\n1:51:51.220 --> 1:51:54.020\n in this operations that you perform on this thing.\n\n1:51:54.020 --> 1:51:56.460\n And this thing needs a model of what it's currently doing.\n\n1:51:56.460 --> 1:51:58.420\n And I think this is exactly the purpose\n\n1:51:58.420 --> 1:51:59.860\n of our own consciousness.\n\n1:52:01.220 --> 1:52:05.380\n Yeah, the program things are tricky on neural networks.\n\n1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:09.020\n So let me ask you, it's not quite program synthesis,\n\n1:52:09.020 --> 1:52:12.060\n but the application of these language models\n\n1:52:12.060 --> 1:52:15.060\n to generation, to program synthesis,\n\n1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:16.580\n but generation of programs.\n\n1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:19.180\n So if you look at GitHub OpenPilot,\n\n1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:21.220\n which is based on OpenAI's codecs,\n\n1:52:21.220 --> 1:52:22.780\n I don't know if you got a chance to look at it,\n\n1:52:22.780 --> 1:52:26.180\n but it's the system that's able to generate code\n\n1:52:26.180 --> 1:52:30.100\n once you prompt it with, what is it?\n\n1:52:30.100 --> 1:52:32.700\n Like the header of a function with some comments.\n\n1:52:32.700 --> 1:52:36.060\n And it seems to do an incredibly good job\n\n1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.220\n or not a perfect job, which is very important,\n\n1:52:39.220 --> 1:52:42.780\n but an incredibly good job of generating functions.\n\n1:52:42.780 --> 1:52:44.220\n What do you make of that?\n\n1:52:44.220 --> 1:52:45.500\n Are you, is this exciting\n\n1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:48.980\n or is this just a party trick, a demo?\n\n1:52:48.980 --> 1:52:50.460\n Or is this revolutionary?\n\n1:52:51.860 --> 1:52:52.980\n I haven't worked with it yet.\n\n1:52:52.980 --> 1:52:55.140\n So it's difficult for me to judge it,\n\n1:52:55.140 --> 1:52:57.100\n but I would not be surprised\n\n1:52:57.100 --> 1:52:59.540\n if it turns out to be a revolutionary.\n\n1:52:59.540 --> 1:53:01.740\n And that's because the majority of programming tasks\n\n1:53:01.740 --> 1:53:04.260\n that are being done in the industry right now\n\n1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:05.940\n are not creative.\n\n1:53:05.940 --> 1:53:08.500\n People are writing code that other people have written,\n\n1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:10.620\n or they're putting things together from code fragments\n\n1:53:10.620 --> 1:53:11.540\n that others have had.\n\n1:53:11.540 --> 1:53:14.300\n And a lot of the work that programmers do in practice\n\n1:53:14.300 --> 1:53:17.780\n is to figure out how to overcome the gaps\n\n1:53:17.780 --> 1:53:18.900\n in their current knowledge\n\n1:53:18.900 --> 1:53:20.940\n and the things that people have already done.\n\n1:53:20.940 --> 1:53:24.060\n How to copy and paste from Stack Overflow, that's right.\n\n1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.380\n And so of course we can automate that.\n\n1:53:26.380 --> 1:53:29.900\n Yeah, to make it much faster to copy and paste\n\n1:53:29.900 --> 1:53:30.860\n from Stack Overflow.\n\n1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:32.820\n Yes, but it's not just copying and pasting.\n\n1:53:32.820 --> 1:53:36.580\n It's also basically learning which parts you need to modify\n\n1:53:36.580 --> 1:53:38.140\n to make them fit together.\n\n1:53:38.140 --> 1:53:41.180\n Yeah, like literally sometimes as simple\n\n1:53:41.180 --> 1:53:43.380\n as just changing the variable names.\n\n1:53:43.380 --> 1:53:45.060\n So it fits into the rest of your code.\n\n1:53:45.060 --> 1:53:47.460\n Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics\n\n1:53:47.460 --> 1:53:49.660\n of what you're doing to some degree.\n\n1:53:49.660 --> 1:53:51.580\n And you can automate some of those things.\n\n1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:53.500\n The thing that makes people nervous of course\n\n1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:57.780\n is that a little bit wrong in a program\n\n1:53:57.780 --> 1:54:02.700\n can have a dramatic effect on the actual final operation\n\n1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:03.540\n of that program.\n\n1:54:03.540 --> 1:54:05.380\n So that's one little error,\n\n1:54:05.380 --> 1:54:08.780\n which in the space of language doesn't really matter,\n\n1:54:08.780 --> 1:54:11.980\n but in the space of programs can matter a lot.\n\n1:54:11.980 --> 1:54:14.100\n Yes, but this is already what is happening\n\n1:54:14.100 --> 1:54:15.820\n when humans program code.\n\n1:54:15.820 --> 1:54:16.820\n Yeah, this is.\n\n1:54:16.820 --> 1:54:20.220\n So we have a technology to deal with this.\n\n1:54:20.220 --> 1:54:23.500\n Somehow it becomes scarier when you know\n\n1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:25.100\n that a program generated code\n\n1:54:25.100 --> 1:54:27.940\n that's running a nuclear power plant.\n\n1:54:27.940 --> 1:54:29.100\n It becomes scarier.\n\n1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:31.380\n You know, humans have errors too.\n\n1:54:31.380 --> 1:54:32.220\n Exactly.\n\n1:54:32.220 --> 1:54:35.100\n But it's scarier when a program is doing it\n\n1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:38.700\n because why, why?\n\n1:54:38.700 --> 1:54:43.660\n I mean, there's a fear that a program,\n\n1:54:43.660 --> 1:54:48.020\n like a program may not be as good as humans\n\n1:54:48.020 --> 1:54:51.340\n to know when stuff is important to not mess up.\n\n1:54:51.340 --> 1:54:56.340\n Like there's a misalignment of priorities of values\n\n1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:01.300\n that's potential.\n\n1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.500\n Maybe that's the source of the worry.\n\n1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:06.380\n I mean, okay, if I give you code generated\n\n1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:11.380\n by GitHub open pilot and code generated by a human\n\n1:55:12.500 --> 1:55:16.020\n and say here, use one of these,\n\n1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:20.380\n which how do you select today and in the next 10 years\n\n1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:21.860\n which code do you use?\n\n1:55:21.860 --> 1:55:24.300\n Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human?\n\n1:55:25.380 --> 1:55:29.580\n At the moment when you go to Stanford to get an MRI,\n\n1:55:29.580 --> 1:55:34.580\n they will write a bill to the insurance over $20,000.\n\n1:55:34.580 --> 1:55:38.300\n And of this, maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance\n\n1:55:38.300 --> 1:55:40.580\n and a quarter gets paid by you.\n\n1:55:40.580 --> 1:55:44.940\n And the MRI cost them $600 to make maybe probably less.\n\n1:55:44.940 --> 1:55:47.700\n And what are the values of the person\n\n1:55:47.700 --> 1:55:50.540\n that writes the software and deploys this process?\n\n1:55:51.820 --> 1:55:56.260\n It's very difficult for me to say whether I trust people.\n\n1:55:56.260 --> 1:55:58.700\n I think that what happens there is a mixture\n\n1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:01.980\n of proper Anglo Saxon Protestant values\n\n1:56:01.980 --> 1:56:04.860\n where somebody is trying to serve an abstract radar hole\n\n1:56:04.860 --> 1:56:06.300\n and organize crime.\n\n1:56:06.300 --> 1:56:08.060\n Well, that's a very harsh,\n\n1:56:10.980 --> 1:56:15.500\n I think that's a harsh view of humanity.\n\n1:56:15.500 --> 1:56:18.780\n There's a lot of bad people, whether incompetent\n\n1:56:18.780 --> 1:56:21.700\n or just malevolent in this world, yes.\n\n1:56:21.700 --> 1:56:25.820\n But it feels like the more malevolent,\n\n1:56:25.820 --> 1:56:28.260\n so the more damage you do to the world,\n\n1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:34.420\n the more resistance you have in your own human heart.\n\n1:56:34.420 --> 1:56:37.140\n Yeah, but don't explain with malevolence or stupidity\n\n1:56:37.140 --> 1:56:38.780\n what can be explained by just people\n\n1:56:38.780 --> 1:56:40.100\n acting on their incentives.\n\n1:56:41.540 --> 1:56:42.940\n Right, so what happens in Stanford\n\n1:56:42.940 --> 1:56:45.100\n is not that somebody is evil.\n\n1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:48.740\n It's just that they do what they're being paid for.\n\n1:56:48.740 --> 1:56:50.500\n No, it's not evil.\n\n1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:53.740\n That's, I tend to, no, I see that as malevolence.\n\n1:56:53.740 --> 1:56:58.740\n I see as I, even like being a good German,\n\n1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:01.540\n as I told you offline, is some,\n\n1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:05.060\n it's not absolute malevolence,\n\n1:57:05.060 --> 1:57:07.460\n but it's a small amount, it's cowardice.\n\n1:57:07.460 --> 1:57:10.580\n I mean, when you see there's something wrong with the world,\n\n1:57:10.580 --> 1:57:15.100\n it's either incompetence and you're not able to see it,\n\n1:57:15.100 --> 1:57:17.780\n or it's cowardice that you're not able to stand up,\n\n1:57:17.780 --> 1:57:21.620\n not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way.\n\n1:57:21.620 --> 1:57:25.940\n So I do think that is a bit of malevolence.\n\n1:57:25.940 --> 1:57:27.660\n I'm not sure the example you're describing\n\n1:57:27.660 --> 1:57:28.500\n is a good example of that.\n\n1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:31.220\n So the question is, what is it that you are aiming for?\n\n1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:34.900\n And if you don't believe in the future,\n\n1:57:34.900 --> 1:57:37.460\n if you, for instance, think that the dollar is going to crash,\n\n1:57:37.460 --> 1:57:39.540\n why would you try to save dollars?\n\n1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:42.580\n If you don't think that humanity will be around\n\n1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:43.740\n in a hundred years from now,\n\n1:57:43.740 --> 1:57:47.500\n because global warming will wipe out civilization,\n\n1:57:47.500 --> 1:57:50.220\n why would you need to act as if it were?\n\n1:57:50.220 --> 1:57:51.660\n Right, so the question is,\n\n1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.980\n is there an overarching aesthetics\n\n1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:56.900\n that is projecting you and the world into the future,\n\n1:57:56.900 --> 1:57:59.020\n which I think is the basic idea of religion,\n\n1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:01.220\n that you understand the interactions\n\n1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:02.340\n that we have with each other\n\n1:58:02.340 --> 1:58:04.780\n as some kind of civilization level agent\n\n1:58:04.780 --> 1:58:07.180\n that is projecting itself into the future.\n\n1:58:07.180 --> 1:58:10.420\n If you don't have that shared purpose,\n\n1:58:10.420 --> 1:58:12.940\n what is there to be ethical for?\n\n1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:16.380\n So I think when we talk about ethics and AI,\n\n1:58:16.380 --> 1:58:20.020\n we need to go beyond the insane bias discussions and so on,\n\n1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:22.060\n where people are just measuring the distance\n\n1:58:22.060 --> 1:58:27.060\n between a statistic to their preferred current world model.\n\n1:58:27.940 --> 1:58:29.340\n The optimism, wait, wait, wait,\n\n1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:31.180\n I was a little confused by the previous thing,\n\n1:58:31.180 --> 1:58:32.260\n just to clarify.\n\n1:58:32.260 --> 1:58:37.260\n There is a kind of underlying morality\n\n1:58:39.820 --> 1:58:43.620\n to having an optimism that human civilization\n\n1:58:43.620 --> 1:58:45.580\n will persist for longer than a hundred years.\n\n1:58:45.580 --> 1:58:49.020\n Like I think a lot of people believe\n\n1:58:50.060 --> 1:58:53.220\n that it's a good thing for us to keep living.\n\n1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:54.060\n Yeah, of course.\n\n1:58:54.060 --> 1:58:54.900\n And thriving.\n\n1:58:54.900 --> 1:58:56.900\n This morality itself is not an end to itself.\n\n1:58:56.900 --> 1:58:59.660\n It's instrumental to people living in a hundred years\n\n1:58:59.660 --> 1:59:03.100\n from now or 500 years from now.\n\n1:59:03.100 --> 1:59:06.540\n So it's only justifiable if you actually think\n\n1:59:06.540 --> 1:59:09.780\n that it will lead to people or increase the probability\n\n1:59:09.780 --> 1:59:12.500\n of people being around in that timeframe.\n\n1:59:12.500 --> 1:59:14.980\n And a lot of people don't actually believe that,\n\n1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:16.860\n at least not actively.\n\n1:59:16.860 --> 1:59:17.980\n But believe what exactly?\n\n1:59:17.980 --> 1:59:19.180\n So I was...\n\n1:59:19.180 --> 1:59:20.620\n Most people don't believe\n\n1:59:20.620 --> 1:59:23.500\n that they can afford to act on such a model.\n\n1:59:23.500 --> 1:59:25.340\n Basically what happens in the US\n\n1:59:25.340 --> 1:59:26.940\n is I think that the healthcare system\n\n1:59:26.940 --> 1:59:28.940\n is for a lot of people no longer sustainable,\n\n1:59:28.940 --> 1:59:30.580\n which means that if they need the help\n\n1:59:30.580 --> 1:59:31.540\n of the healthcare system,\n\n1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:33.460\n they're often not able to afford it.\n\n1:59:33.460 --> 1:59:35.060\n And when they cannot help it,\n\n1:59:35.060 --> 1:59:37.300\n they are often going bankrupt.\n\n1:59:37.300 --> 1:59:40.220\n I think the leading cause of personal bankruptcy\n\n1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:42.740\n in the US is the healthcare system.\n\n1:59:42.740 --> 1:59:44.820\n And that would not be necessary.\n\n1:59:44.820 --> 1:59:46.660\n It's not because people are consuming\n\n1:59:46.660 --> 1:59:48.780\n more and more medical services\n\n1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:51.460\n and are achieving a much, much longer life as a result.\n\n1:59:51.460 --> 1:59:53.620\n That's not actually the story that is happening\n\n1:59:53.620 --> 1:59:55.300\n because you can compare it to other countries.\n\n1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:58.420\n And life expectancy in the US is currently not increasing\n\n1:59:58.420 --> 2:00:00.420\n and it's not as high as in all the other\n\n2:00:00.420 --> 2:00:01.700\n industrialized countries.\n\n2:00:01.700 --> 2:00:03.820\n So some industrialized countries are doing better\n\n2:00:03.820 --> 2:00:06.260\n with a much cheaper healthcare system.\n\n2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:08.580\n And what you can see is for instance,\n\n2:00:08.580 --> 2:00:09.980\n administrative bloat.\n\n2:00:09.980 --> 2:00:13.660\n The healthcare system has maybe to some degree\n\n2:00:13.660 --> 2:00:17.220\n deliberately set up as a job placement program\n\n2:00:17.220 --> 2:00:19.740\n to allow people to continue living\n\n2:00:19.740 --> 2:00:20.940\n in middle class existence,\n\n2:00:20.940 --> 2:00:25.940\n despite not having useful use case in productivity.\n\n2:00:25.940 --> 2:00:28.700\n So they are being paid to push paper around.\n\n2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:31.540\n And the number of administrator in the healthcare system\n\n2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:33.180\n has been increasing much faster\n\n2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:35.020\n than the number of practitioners.\n\n2:00:35.020 --> 2:00:37.060\n And this is something that you have to pay for.\n\n2:00:37.060 --> 2:00:40.460\n And also the revenues that are being generated\n\n2:00:40.460 --> 2:00:42.220\n in the healthcare system are relatively large\n\n2:00:42.220 --> 2:00:43.700\n and somebody has to pay for them.\n\n2:00:43.700 --> 2:00:45.900\n And the result why they are so large\n\n2:00:45.900 --> 2:00:48.460\n is because market mechanisms are not working.\n\n2:00:48.460 --> 2:00:51.860\n The FDA is largely not protecting people\n\n2:00:51.860 --> 2:00:55.380\n from malpractice of healthcare providers.\n\n2:00:55.380 --> 2:00:58.660\n The FDA is protecting healthcare providers\n\n2:00:58.660 --> 2:00:59.940\n from competition.\n\n2:00:59.940 --> 2:01:00.780\n Right, okay.\n\n2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:03.380\n So this is a thing that has to do with values.\n\n2:01:03.380 --> 2:01:06.500\n And this is not because people are malicious on all levels.\n\n2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:08.460\n It's because they are not incentivized\n\n2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:11.380\n to act on a greater whole on this idea\n\n2:01:11.380 --> 2:01:14.340\n that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient,\n\n2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:15.660\n like you would treat a family member.\n\n2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:18.020\n Yeah, but we're trying, I mean,\n\n2:01:18.020 --> 2:01:20.020\n you're highlighting a lot of the flaws\n\n2:01:20.020 --> 2:01:21.220\n of the different institutions,\n\n2:01:21.220 --> 2:01:23.100\n the systems we're operating under,\n\n2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:25.940\n but I think there's a continued throughout history\n\n2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:29.380\n mechanism design of trying to design incentives\n\n2:01:29.380 --> 2:01:31.420\n in such a way that these systems behave\n\n2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:32.780\n better and better and better.\n\n2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:34.220\n I mean, it's a very difficult thing\n\n2:01:34.220 --> 2:01:38.140\n to operate a society of hundreds of millions of people\n\n2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:39.220\n effectively with.\n\n2:01:39.220 --> 2:01:42.820\n Yes, so do we live in a society that is ever correcting?\n\n2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:46.740\n Is this, do we observe that our models\n\n2:01:46.740 --> 2:01:49.420\n of what we are doing are predictive of the future\n\n2:01:49.420 --> 2:01:51.540\n and when they are not, we improve them.\n\n2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:54.780\n Are our laws adjudicated with clauses\n\n2:01:54.780 --> 2:01:56.020\n that you put into every law,\n\n2:01:56.020 --> 2:01:57.900\n what is meant to be achieved by that law\n\n2:01:57.900 --> 2:02:00.060\n and the law will be automatically repealed\n\n2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:01.340\n if it's not achieving that, right?\n\n2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:03.220\n If you are optimizing your own laws,\n\n2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:05.140\n if you're writing your own source code,\n\n2:02:05.140 --> 2:02:08.180\n you probably make an estimate of what is this thing\n\n2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:09.420\n that's currently wrong in my life?\n\n2:02:09.420 --> 2:02:12.180\n What is it that I should change about my own policies?\n\n2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:14.100\n What is the expected outcome?\n\n2:02:14.100 --> 2:02:16.580\n And if that outcome doesn't manifest,\n\n2:02:16.580 --> 2:02:18.460\n I will change the policy back, right?\n\n2:02:18.460 --> 2:02:20.260\n Or I would change it to something different.\n\n2:02:20.260 --> 2:02:22.220\n Are we doing this on a societal level?\n\n2:02:22.220 --> 2:02:23.060\n I think so.\n\n2:02:23.060 --> 2:02:25.580\n I think it's easy to sort of highlight the,\n\n2:02:25.580 --> 2:02:27.940\n I think we're doing it in the way that,\n\n2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.380\n like I operate my current life.\n\n2:02:30.380 --> 2:02:32.580\n I didn't sleep much last night.\n\n2:02:32.580 --> 2:02:34.740\n You would say that Lex,\n\n2:02:34.740 --> 2:02:35.980\n the way you need to operate your life\n\n2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:37.340\n is you need to always get sleep.\n\n2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:39.060\n The fact that you didn't sleep last night\n\n2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:43.060\n is totally the wrong way to operate in your life.\n\n2:02:43.060 --> 2:02:46.460\n Like you should have gotten all your shit done in time\n\n2:02:46.460 --> 2:02:48.940\n and gotten to sleep because sleep is very important\n\n2:02:48.940 --> 2:02:50.540\n for health and you're highlighting,\n\n2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:52.500\n look, this person is not sleeping.\n\n2:02:52.500 --> 2:02:56.380\n Look, the medical, the healthcare system is operating poor.\n\n2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:59.140\n But the point is we just,\n\n2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:00.460\n it seems like this is the way,\n\n2:03:00.460 --> 2:03:02.700\n especially in the capitalist society, we operate.\n\n2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:05.740\n We keep running into trouble and last minute,\n\n2:03:05.740 --> 2:03:09.260\n we try to get our way out through innovation\n\n2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:10.740\n and it seems to work.\n\n2:03:10.740 --> 2:03:13.380\n You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying\n\n2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:18.380\n to build a better world and get urgency about them\n\n2:03:18.380 --> 2:03:22.900\n when the problem becomes more and more imminent.\n\n2:03:22.900 --> 2:03:24.380\n And that's the way this operates.\n\n2:03:24.380 --> 2:03:29.380\n But if you look at the long arc of history,\n\n2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:33.140\n it seems like that operating on deadlines\n\n2:03:34.180 --> 2:03:36.980\n produces progress and builds better and better systems.\n\n2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:39.060\n You probably agree with me that the US\n\n2:03:39.060 --> 2:03:44.060\n should have engaged in mask production in January 2020\n\n2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:47.900\n and that we should have shut down the airports early on\n\n2:03:47.900 --> 2:03:50.940\n and that we should have made it mandatory\n\n2:03:50.940 --> 2:03:53.860\n that the people that work in nursing homes\n\n2:03:53.860 --> 2:03:57.940\n are living on campus rather than living at home\n\n2:03:57.940 --> 2:04:01.460\n and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes\n\n2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:03.900\n that had no immune response to COVID.\n\n2:04:03.900 --> 2:04:08.180\n And that is something that was, I think, visible back then.\n\n2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:10.540\n The correct decisions haven't been made.\n\n2:04:10.540 --> 2:04:12.580\n We would have the same situation again.\n\n2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:14.340\n How do we know that these wrong decisions\n\n2:04:14.340 --> 2:04:15.780\n are not being made again?\n\n2:04:15.780 --> 2:04:17.620\n Have the people that made the decisions\n\n2:04:17.620 --> 2:04:20.580\n to not protect the nursing homes been punished?\n\n2:04:20.580 --> 2:04:23.180\n Have the people that made the wrong decisions\n\n2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:26.780\n with respect to testing that prevented the development\n\n2:04:26.780 --> 2:04:29.500\n of testing by startup companies and the importing\n\n2:04:29.500 --> 2:04:32.140\n of tests from countries that already had them,\n\n2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:34.460\n have these people been held responsible?\n\n2:04:34.460 --> 2:04:37.380\n First of all, so what do you wanna put\n\n2:04:37.380 --> 2:04:38.780\n before the firing squad?\n\n2:04:38.780 --> 2:04:39.860\n I think they are being held responsible.\n\n2:04:39.860 --> 2:04:41.820\n No, just make sure that this doesn't happen again.\n\n2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:46.220\n No, but it's not that, yes, they're being held responsible\n\n2:04:46.220 --> 2:04:48.820\n by many voices, by people being frustrated.\n\n2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:50.740\n There's new leaders being born now\n\n2:04:50.740 --> 2:04:54.220\n that we're going to see rise to the top in 10 years.\n\n2:04:54.220 --> 2:04:57.380\n This moves slower than, there's obviously\n\n2:04:57.380 --> 2:05:01.220\n a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy\n\n2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:03.660\n and these systems move slowly.\n\n2:05:03.660 --> 2:05:06.860\n They move like science, one death at a time.\n\n2:05:06.860 --> 2:05:11.340\n So yes, I think the pain that's been felt\n\n2:05:11.340 --> 2:05:15.540\n in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world.\n\n2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:18.340\n Maybe I'm getting old, I suspect that every generation\n\n2:05:18.340 --> 2:05:21.500\n in the US after the war has lost the plot even more.\n\n2:05:21.500 --> 2:05:23.140\n I don't see this development.\n\n2:05:23.140 --> 2:05:24.700\n The war, World War II?\n\n2:05:24.700 --> 2:05:29.140\n Yes, so basically there was a time when we were modernist\n\n2:05:29.140 --> 2:05:33.620\n and in this modernist time, the US felt actively threatened\n\n2:05:33.620 --> 2:05:35.740\n by the things that happened in the world.\n\n2:05:35.740 --> 2:05:38.660\n The US was worried about possibility of failure\n\n2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:44.580\n and this imminence of possible failure led to decisions.\n\n2:05:44.580 --> 2:05:47.340\n There was a time when the government would listen\n\n2:05:47.340 --> 2:05:50.540\n to physicists about how to do things\n\n2:05:50.540 --> 2:05:52.100\n and the physicists were actually concerned\n\n2:05:52.100 --> 2:05:53.580\n about what the government should be doing.\n\n2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:56.100\n So they would be writing letters to the government\n\n2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:58.860\n and so for instance, the decision for the Manhattan Project\n\n2:05:58.860 --> 2:06:01.740\n was something that was driven in a conversation\n\n2:06:01.740 --> 2:06:04.020\n between physicists and the government.\n\n2:06:04.020 --> 2:06:06.900\n I don't think such a discussion would take place today.\n\n2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:10.500\n I disagree, I think if the virus was much deadlier,\n\n2:06:10.500 --> 2:06:12.620\n we would see a very different response.\n\n2:06:12.620 --> 2:06:14.900\n I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly\n\n2:06:14.900 --> 2:06:17.420\n and instead because it wasn't very deadly,\n\n2:06:17.420 --> 2:06:20.420\n what happened is the current system\n\n2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:21.980\n started to politicize it.\n\n2:06:21.980 --> 2:06:25.300\n The mask, this is what I realized with masks early on,\n\n2:06:25.300 --> 2:06:29.540\n they were not, very quickly became not as a solution\n\n2:06:29.540 --> 2:06:32.620\n but they became a thing that politicians used\n\n2:06:32.620 --> 2:06:33.900\n to divide the country.\n\n2:06:33.900 --> 2:06:36.940\n So the same things happened with vaccines, same thing.\n\n2:06:36.940 --> 2:06:38.740\n So like nobody's really,\n\n2:06:38.740 --> 2:06:41.100\n people weren't talking about solutions to this problem\n\n2:06:41.100 --> 2:06:43.060\n because I don't think the problem was bad enough.\n\n2:06:43.060 --> 2:06:45.020\n When you talk about the war,\n\n2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:47.900\n I think our lives are too comfortable.\n\n2:06:48.740 --> 2:06:52.220\n I think in the developed world, things are too good\n\n2:06:52.220 --> 2:06:54.900\n and we have not faced severe dangers.\n\n2:06:54.900 --> 2:06:57.500\n When the danger, the severe dangers,\n\n2:06:57.500 --> 2:07:00.740\n existential threats are faced, that's when we step up\n\n2:07:00.740 --> 2:07:02.980\n on a small scale and a large scale.\n\n2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:07.980\n Now, I don't, that's sort of my argument here\n\n2:07:07.980 --> 2:07:11.700\n but I did think the virus is, I was hoping\n\n2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:14.980\n that it was actually sufficiently dangerous\n\n2:07:16.060 --> 2:07:18.660\n for us to step up because especially in the early days,\n\n2:07:18.660 --> 2:07:23.260\n it was unclear, it still is unclear because of mutations,\n\n2:07:23.260 --> 2:07:25.820\n how bad it might be, right?\n\n2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:30.700\n And so I thought we would step up and even,\n\n2:07:30.700 --> 2:07:35.540\n so the masks point is a tricky one because to me,\n\n2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:38.780\n the manufacture of masks isn't even the problem.\n\n2:07:38.780 --> 2:07:41.020\n I'm still to this day and I was involved\n\n2:07:41.020 --> 2:07:44.300\n with a bunch of this work, have not seen good science done\n\n2:07:44.300 --> 2:07:45.900\n on whether masks work or not.\n\n2:07:46.860 --> 2:07:49.420\n Like there still has not been a large scale study.\n\n2:07:49.420 --> 2:07:51.820\n To me, that should be, there should be large scale studies\n\n2:07:51.820 --> 2:07:55.140\n and every possible solution, like aggressive\n\n2:07:55.140 --> 2:07:56.780\n in the same way that the vaccine development\n\n2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:57.740\n was aggressive.\n\n2:07:57.740 --> 2:07:59.860\n There should be masks, which tests,\n\n2:07:59.860 --> 2:08:03.740\n what kind of tests work really well, what kind of,\n\n2:08:03.740 --> 2:08:06.860\n like even the question of how the virus spreads.\n\n2:08:06.860 --> 2:08:09.820\n There should be aggressive studies on that to understand.\n\n2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:12.860\n I'm still, as far as I know, there's still a lot\n\n2:08:12.860 --> 2:08:14.180\n of uncertainty about that.\n\n2:08:14.180 --> 2:08:17.100\n Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem\n\n2:08:17.100 --> 2:08:18.540\n that needs to be solved.\n\n2:08:18.540 --> 2:08:21.940\n It's that I was surprised about, but I wouldn't.\n\n2:08:21.940 --> 2:08:24.580\n So I find that our views are largely convergent\n\n2:08:24.580 --> 2:08:25.460\n but not completely.\n\n2:08:25.460 --> 2:08:29.340\n So I agree with the thing that because our society\n\n2:08:29.340 --> 2:08:32.580\n in some sense perceives itself as too big to fail.\n\n2:08:32.580 --> 2:08:33.420\n Right.\n\n2:08:33.420 --> 2:08:35.940\n The virus did not alert people to the fact\n\n2:08:35.940 --> 2:08:37.860\n that we are facing possible failure\n\n2:08:38.820 --> 2:08:41.540\n that basically put us into the postmodernist mode.\n\n2:08:41.540 --> 2:08:43.260\n And I don't mean in a philosophical sense\n\n2:08:43.260 --> 2:08:45.220\n but in a societal sense.\n\n2:08:45.220 --> 2:08:47.940\n The difference between the postmodern society\n\n2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:50.540\n and the modern society is that the modernist society\n\n2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:52.340\n has to deal with the ground truth\n\n2:08:52.340 --> 2:08:55.540\n and the postmodernist society has to deal with appearances.\n\n2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:57.820\n Politics becomes a performance\n\n2:08:57.820 --> 2:08:59.780\n and the performance is done for an audience\n\n2:08:59.780 --> 2:09:02.260\n and the organized audience is the media.\n\n2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:05.380\n And the media evaluates itself via other media, right?\n\n2:09:05.380 --> 2:09:09.100\n So you have an audience of critics that evaluate themselves.\n\n2:09:09.100 --> 2:09:10.660\n And I don't think it's so much the failure\n\n2:09:10.660 --> 2:09:12.820\n of the politicians because to get in power\n\n2:09:12.820 --> 2:09:15.700\n and to stay in power, you need to be able\n\n2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:17.580\n to deal with the published opinion.\n\n2:09:17.580 --> 2:09:19.220\n Well, I think it goes in cycles\n\n2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:22.300\n because what's going to happen is all\n\n2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:24.820\n of the small business owners, all the people\n\n2:09:24.820 --> 2:09:27.900\n who truly are suffering and will suffer more\n\n2:09:27.900 --> 2:09:31.940\n because the effects of the closure of the economy\n\n2:09:31.940 --> 2:09:34.220\n and the lack of solutions to the virus,\n\n2:09:34.220 --> 2:09:36.300\n they're going to apprise.\n\n2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:40.180\n And hopefully, I mean, this is where charismatic leaders\n\n2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:42.620\n can get the world in trouble\n\n2:09:42.620 --> 2:09:46.500\n but hopefully will elect great leaders\n\n2:09:47.900 --> 2:09:51.100\n that will break through this postmodernist idea\n\n2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:55.420\n of the media and the perception\n\n2:09:55.420 --> 2:09:57.660\n and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:09:57.660 --> 2:09:59.340\n But you know, this can go either way.\n\n2:09:59.340 --> 2:10:00.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:00.300 --> 2:10:03.620\n When the Weimar Republic was unable to deal\n\n2:10:03.620 --> 2:10:07.540\n with the economic crisis that Germany was facing,\n\n2:10:07.540 --> 2:10:09.100\n there was an option to go back.\n\n2:10:10.340 --> 2:10:11.620\n But there were people which thought,\n\n2:10:11.620 --> 2:10:14.420\n let's get back to a constitutional monarchy\n\n2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:18.780\n and let's get this to work because democracy doesn't work.\n\n2:10:18.780 --> 2:10:21.740\n And eventually, there was no way back.\n\n2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.300\n People decided there was no way back.\n\n2:10:23.300 --> 2:10:24.420\n They needed to go forward.\n\n2:10:24.420 --> 2:10:26.700\n And the only options for going forward\n\n2:10:26.700 --> 2:10:29.460\n was to become Stalinist communist,\n\n2:10:29.460 --> 2:10:34.260\n basically an option to completely expropriate\n\n2:10:34.260 --> 2:10:36.820\n the factories and so on and nationalize them\n\n2:10:36.820 --> 2:10:40.540\n and to reorganize Germany in communist terms\n\n2:10:40.540 --> 2:10:44.660\n and ally itself with Stalin and fascism.\n\n2:10:44.660 --> 2:10:47.980\n And both options were obviously very bad.\n\n2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:49.980\n And the one that the Germans picked\n\n2:10:49.980 --> 2:10:54.300\n led to a catastrophe that devastated Europe.\n\n2:10:54.300 --> 2:10:57.180\n And I'm not sure if the US has an immune response\n\n2:10:57.180 --> 2:10:58.020\n against that.\n\n2:10:58.020 --> 2:11:01.340\n I think that the far right is currently very weak in the US,\n\n2:11:01.340 --> 2:11:02.940\n but this can easily change.\n\n2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:08.780\n Do you think from a historical perspective,\n\n2:11:08.780 --> 2:11:10.820\n Hitler could have been stopped\n\n2:11:10.820 --> 2:11:14.020\n from within Germany or from outside?\n\n2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:17.780\n Or this, well, depends on who you wanna focus,\n\n2:11:17.780 --> 2:11:20.220\n whether you wanna focus on Stalin or Hitler,\n\n2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:22.380\n but it feels like Hitler was the one\n\n2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:25.180\n as a political movement that could have been stopped.\n\n2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:28.700\n I think that the point was that a lot of people\n\n2:11:28.700 --> 2:11:32.340\n wanted Hitler, so he got support from a lot of quarters.\n\n2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:35.100\n There was a number of industrialists who supported him\n\n2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:36.780\n because they thought that the democracy\n\n2:11:36.780 --> 2:11:38.460\n is obviously not working and unstable\n\n2:11:38.460 --> 2:11:40.620\n and you need a strong man.\n\n2:11:40.620 --> 2:11:43.220\n And he was willing to play that part.\n\n2:11:43.220 --> 2:11:45.460\n There were also people in the US who thought\n\n2:11:45.460 --> 2:11:47.860\n that Hitler would stop Stalin\n\n2:11:47.860 --> 2:11:51.460\n and would act as a bulwark against Bolshevism,\n\n2:11:52.300 --> 2:11:54.140\n which he probably would have done, right?\n\n2:11:54.140 --> 2:11:56.220\n But at which cost?\n\n2:11:56.220 --> 2:11:59.740\n And then many of the things that he was going to do,\n\n2:11:59.740 --> 2:12:03.780\n like the Holocaust, was something where people thought\n\n2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:07.140\n this is rhetoric, he's not actually going to do this.\n\n2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:10.020\n Especially many of the Jews themselves, which were humanists.\n\n2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:12.300\n And for them, this was outside of the scope\n\n2:12:12.300 --> 2:12:13.260\n that was thinkable.\n\n2:12:13.260 --> 2:12:14.260\n Right.\n\n2:12:14.260 --> 2:12:18.940\n I mean, I wonder if Hitler is uniquely,\n\n2:12:20.140 --> 2:12:23.500\n I wanna carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.\n\n2:12:23.500 --> 2:12:26.420\n So if Hitler was never born,\n\n2:12:26.420 --> 2:12:29.100\n if somebody else would come in this place.\n\n2:12:29.100 --> 2:12:33.780\n So like, just thinking about the progress of history,\n\n2:12:33.780 --> 2:12:36.700\n how important are those singular figures\n\n2:12:36.700 --> 2:12:40.980\n that lead to mass destruction and cruelty?\n\n2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:45.260\n Because my sense is Hitler was unique.\n\n2:12:47.540 --> 2:12:49.420\n It wasn't just about the environment\n\n2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:51.620\n and the context that gave him,\n\n2:12:51.620 --> 2:12:54.740\n like another person would not come in his place\n\n2:12:54.740 --> 2:12:58.220\n to do as destructive of the things that he did.\n\n2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:02.860\n There was a combination of charisma, of madness,\n\n2:13:02.860 --> 2:13:07.180\n of psychopathy, of just ego, all those things,\n\n2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:09.540\n which are very unlikely to come together\n\n2:13:09.540 --> 2:13:11.700\n in one person in the right time.\n\n2:13:12.540 --> 2:13:14.660\n It also depends on the context of the country\n\n2:13:14.660 --> 2:13:16.500\n that you're operating in.\n\n2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:21.500\n If you tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny\n\n2:13:22.220 --> 2:13:23.820\n in this romantic country,\n\n2:13:23.820 --> 2:13:25.500\n the effect is probably different\n\n2:13:25.500 --> 2:13:27.180\n than it is in other countries.\n\n2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:32.180\n But Stalin has killed a few more people than Hitler did.\n\n2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:35.820\n And if you look at the probability\n\n2:13:35.820 --> 2:13:37.580\n that you survived under Stalin,\n\n2:13:39.220 --> 2:13:43.140\n Hitler killed people if he thought\n\n2:13:43.140 --> 2:13:45.140\n they were not worth living,\n\n2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:49.260\n or if they were harmful to his racist project.\n\n2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:52.580\n He basically felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan\n\n2:13:52.580 --> 2:13:55.140\n and would not be willing to participate\n\n2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:57.500\n in the racist redefinition of society\n\n2:13:57.500 --> 2:13:58.780\n and the value of society,\n\n2:13:58.780 --> 2:14:01.420\n and there is no state in this way\n\n2:14:01.420 --> 2:14:03.260\n that he wanted to have it.\n\n2:14:03.260 --> 2:14:06.980\n So he saw them as harmful danger,\n\n2:14:06.980 --> 2:14:09.460\n especially since they played such an important role\n\n2:14:09.460 --> 2:14:13.300\n in the economy and culture of Germany.\n\n2:14:13.300 --> 2:14:18.020\n And so basically he had some radical\n\n2:14:18.020 --> 2:14:20.780\n but rational reason to murder them.\n\n2:14:20.780 --> 2:14:23.420\n And Stalin just killed everyone.\n\n2:14:23.420 --> 2:14:26.140\n Basically the Stalinist purges were such a random thing\n\n2:14:26.140 --> 2:14:31.140\n where he said that there's a certain possibility\n\n2:14:31.580 --> 2:14:34.660\n that this particular part of the population\n\n2:14:34.660 --> 2:14:36.740\n has a number of German collaborators or something,\n\n2:14:36.740 --> 2:14:38.820\n and we just kill them all, right?\n\n2:14:38.820 --> 2:14:40.660\n Or if you look at what Mao did,\n\n2:14:40.660 --> 2:14:42.980\n the number of people that were killed\n\n2:14:42.980 --> 2:14:45.620\n in absolute numbers were much higher under Mao\n\n2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:47.660\n than they were under Stalin.\n\n2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:49.820\n So it's super hard to say.\n\n2:14:49.820 --> 2:14:53.540\n The other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on,\n\n2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:55.060\n how many people he killed.\n\n2:14:56.100 --> 2:14:58.900\n When you see there are a number of things\n\n2:14:58.900 --> 2:14:59.900\n that happen in human history\n\n2:14:59.900 --> 2:15:02.500\n that actually really put a substantial dent\n\n2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:05.900\n in the existing population, or Napoleon.\n\n2:15:05.900 --> 2:15:09.500\n And it's very difficult to eventually measure it\n\n2:15:09.500 --> 2:15:12.020\n because what's happening is basically evolution\n\n2:15:12.020 --> 2:15:17.020\n on a human scale where one monkey figures out\n\n2:15:17.220 --> 2:15:22.220\n a way to become viral and is using this viral technology\n\n2:15:22.380 --> 2:15:24.500\n to change the patterns of society\n\n2:15:24.500 --> 2:15:26.500\n at the very, very large scale.\n\n2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:29.860\n And what we find so abhorrent about these changes\n\n2:15:29.860 --> 2:15:32.340\n is the complexity that is being destroyed by this.\n\n2:15:32.340 --> 2:15:34.940\n That's basically like a big fire that burns out\n\n2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:36.780\n a lot of the existing culture and structure\n\n2:15:36.780 --> 2:15:38.060\n that existed before.\n\n2:15:38.060 --> 2:15:42.580\n Yeah, and it all just starts with one monkey.\n\n2:15:42.580 --> 2:15:44.460\n One charismatic ape.\n\n2:15:44.460 --> 2:15:46.060\n And there's a bunch of them throughout history.\n\n2:15:46.060 --> 2:15:47.940\n Yeah, but it's in a given environment.\n\n2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:51.100\n It's basically similar to wildfires in California, right?\n\n2:15:51.100 --> 2:15:53.260\n The temperature is rising.\n\n2:15:53.260 --> 2:15:55.540\n There is less rain falling.\n\n2:15:55.540 --> 2:15:57.900\n And then suddenly a single spark can have an effect\n\n2:15:57.900 --> 2:15:59.860\n that in other times would be contained.\n\n2:16:00.780 --> 2:16:04.620\n Okay, speaking of which, I love how we went\n\n2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:09.020\n to Hitler and Stalin from 20, 30 minutes ago,\n\n2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:13.620\n GPT3 generating, doing programs that this is.\n\n2:16:13.620 --> 2:16:18.300\n The argument was about morality of AI versus human.\n\n2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:26.220\n And specifically in the context of writing programs,\n\n2:16:26.220 --> 2:16:28.540\n specifically in the context of programs\n\n2:16:28.540 --> 2:16:29.940\n that can be destructive.\n\n2:16:29.940 --> 2:16:31.860\n So running nuclear power plants\n\n2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:35.100\n or autonomous weapons systems, for example.\n\n2:16:35.100 --> 2:16:39.580\n And I think your inclination was to say that\n\n2:16:39.580 --> 2:16:43.460\n it's not so obvious that AI would be less moral than humans\n\n2:16:43.460 --> 2:16:46.740\n or less effective at making a world\n\n2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:48.660\n that would make humans happy.\n\n2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:52.660\n So I'm not talking about self directed systems\n\n2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:57.100\n that are making their own goals at a global scale.\n\n2:16:57.100 --> 2:16:59.140\n If you just talk about the deployment\n\n2:16:59.140 --> 2:17:03.380\n of technological systems that are able to see order\n\n2:17:03.380 --> 2:17:05.580\n and patterns and use this as control models\n\n2:17:05.580 --> 2:17:08.420\n to act on the goals that we give them,\n\n2:17:08.420 --> 2:17:11.140\n then if we have the correct incentives\n\n2:17:11.140 --> 2:17:13.180\n to set the correct incentives for these systems,\n\n2:17:13.180 --> 2:17:14.380\n I'm quite optimistic.\n\n2:17:16.060 --> 2:17:19.140\n So humans versus AI, let me give you an example.\n\n2:17:20.660 --> 2:17:22.140\n Autonomous weapon system.\n\n2:17:23.900 --> 2:17:26.900\n Let's say there's a city somewhere in the Middle East\n\n2:17:26.900 --> 2:17:30.380\n that has a number of terrorists.\n\n2:17:30.380 --> 2:17:32.180\n And the question is,\n\n2:17:32.180 --> 2:17:35.020\n what's currently done with drone technologies,\n\n2:17:35.020 --> 2:17:37.100\n you have information about the location\n\n2:17:37.100 --> 2:17:40.620\n of a particular terrorist and you have a targeted attack,\n\n2:17:40.620 --> 2:17:42.820\n you have a bombing of that particular building.\n\n2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:45.900\n And that's all directed by humans\n\n2:17:45.900 --> 2:17:47.980\n at the high level strategy\n\n2:17:47.980 --> 2:17:50.580\n and also at the deployment of individual bombs and missiles\n\n2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:53.940\n like the actual, everything is done by human\n\n2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:56.700\n except the final targeting.\n\n2:17:56.700 --> 2:18:01.700\n And it's like spot, similar thing, like control the flight.\n\n2:18:01.820 --> 2:18:05.780\n Okay, what if you give AI control and saying,\n\n2:18:07.860 --> 2:18:10.300\n write a program that says,\n\n2:18:10.300 --> 2:18:12.180\n here's the best information I have available\n\n2:18:12.180 --> 2:18:14.780\n about the location of these five terrorists,\n\n2:18:14.780 --> 2:18:17.820\n here's the city, make sure all the bombing you do\n\n2:18:17.820 --> 2:18:21.820\n is constrained to the city, make sure it's precision based,\n\n2:18:21.820 --> 2:18:22.860\n but you take care of it.\n\n2:18:22.860 --> 2:18:25.660\n So you do one level of abstraction out\n\n2:18:25.660 --> 2:18:28.700\n and saying, take care of the terrorists in the city.\n\n2:18:29.580 --> 2:18:31.420\n Which are you more comfortable with,\n\n2:18:31.420 --> 2:18:35.700\n the humans or the JavaScript GPT3 generated code\n\n2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:38.220\n that's doing the deployment?\n\n2:18:38.220 --> 2:18:42.340\n I mean, this is the kind of question I'm asking,\n\n2:18:42.340 --> 2:18:47.100\n is the kind of bugs that we see in human nature,\n\n2:18:47.100 --> 2:18:51.220\n are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI?\n\n2:18:51.220 --> 2:18:52.460\n There are different bugs.\n\n2:18:52.460 --> 2:18:55.980\n There is an issue that if people are creating\n\n2:18:55.980 --> 2:18:59.900\n an imperfect automation of a process\n\n2:18:59.900 --> 2:19:02.860\n that normally requires a moral judgment,\n\n2:19:02.860 --> 2:19:05.940\n and this moral judgment is the reason\n\n2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:07.460\n why it cannot be automated often,\n\n2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:12.180\n it's not because the computation is too expensive,\n\n2:19:12.180 --> 2:19:14.300\n but because the model that you give the AI\n\n2:19:14.300 --> 2:19:17.500\n is not an adequate model of the dynamics of the world,\n\n2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:19.780\n because the AI does not understand the context\n\n2:19:19.780 --> 2:19:21.940\n that it's operating in the right way.\n\n2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:24.940\n And this is something that already happens with Excel.\n\n2:19:24.940 --> 2:19:27.860\n You don't need to have an AI system to do this.\n\n2:19:27.860 --> 2:19:30.340\n You have an automated process in place\n\n2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:33.180\n where humans decide using automated criteria\n\n2:19:33.180 --> 2:19:36.020\n whom to kill when and whom to target when,\n\n2:19:36.020 --> 2:19:37.180\n which already happens.\n\n2:19:38.220 --> 2:19:40.300\n And you have no way to get off the kill list\n\n2:19:40.300 --> 2:19:42.860\n once that happens, once you have been targeted\n\n2:19:42.860 --> 2:19:44.860\n according to some automatic criterion\n\n2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:48.980\n by people in a bureaucracy, that is the issue.\n\n2:19:48.980 --> 2:19:52.260\n The issue is not the AI, it's the automation.\n\n2:19:52.260 --> 2:19:56.380\n So there's something about, right, it's automation,\n\n2:19:56.380 --> 2:19:58.820\n but there's something about the,\n\n2:19:58.820 --> 2:20:00.660\n there's a certain level of abstraction\n\n2:20:00.660 --> 2:20:04.340\n where you give control to AI to do the automation.\n\n2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:07.100\n There's a scale that can be achieved\n\n2:20:07.100 --> 2:20:10.780\n that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake\n\n2:20:10.780 --> 2:20:12.980\n and scale of destruction that can be achieved\n\n2:20:14.580 --> 2:20:16.860\n of the kind that humans cannot achieve.\n\n2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:19.620\n So AI is much more able to destroy\n\n2:20:19.620 --> 2:20:22.580\n an entire country accidentally versus humans.\n\n2:20:22.580 --> 2:20:27.300\n It feels like the more civilians die as they react\n\n2:20:27.300 --> 2:20:30.900\n or suffer as the consequences of your decisions,\n\n2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:34.260\n the more weight there is on the human mind\n\n2:20:34.260 --> 2:20:35.500\n to make that decision.\n\n2:20:36.380 --> 2:20:39.060\n And so like, it becomes more and more unlikely\n\n2:20:39.060 --> 2:20:41.460\n to make that decision for humans.\n\n2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:44.900\n For AI, it feels like it's harder to encode\n\n2:20:44.900 --> 2:20:47.020\n that kind of weight.\n\n2:20:47.020 --> 2:20:49.620\n In a way, the AI that we're currently building\n\n2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:51.900\n is automating statistics, right?\n\n2:20:51.900 --> 2:20:53.860\n Intelligence is the ability to make models\n\n2:20:53.860 --> 2:20:55.220\n so you can act on them,\n\n2:20:55.220 --> 2:20:57.420\n and AI is the tool to make better models.\n\n2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:01.540\n So in principle, if you're using AI wisely,\n\n2:21:01.540 --> 2:21:04.220\n you're able to prevent more harm.\n\n2:21:04.220 --> 2:21:07.860\n And I think that the main issue is not on the side of the AI,\n\n2:21:07.860 --> 2:21:09.940\n it's on the side of the human command hierarchy\n\n2:21:09.940 --> 2:21:12.300\n that is using technology irresponsibly.\n\n2:21:12.300 --> 2:21:15.740\n So the question is how hard is it to encode,\n\n2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:19.060\n to properly encode the right incentives into the AI?\n\n2:21:19.060 --> 2:21:21.420\n So for instance, there's this idea\n\n2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:24.460\n of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown\n\n2:21:24.460 --> 2:21:27.620\n with AI systems and the neural network is a black box\n\n2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:28.460\n and so on.\n\n2:21:28.460 --> 2:21:30.220\n And it turns out our neural networks\n\n2:21:30.220 --> 2:21:32.300\n are actually not black boxes anymore.\n\n2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.620\n There are function approximators using linear algebra,\n\n2:21:36.620 --> 2:21:40.020\n and there are performing things that we can understand.\n\n2:21:40.020 --> 2:21:42.820\n But we can also, instead of letting the neural network\n\n2:21:42.820 --> 2:21:44.940\n fly the airplane, use the neural network\n\n2:21:44.940 --> 2:21:47.420\n to generate a provably correct program.\n\n2:21:47.420 --> 2:21:49.900\n There's a degree of accuracy of the proof\n\n2:21:49.900 --> 2:21:51.860\n that a human could not achieve.\n\n2:21:51.860 --> 2:21:54.100\n And so we can use our AI by combining\n\n2:21:54.100 --> 2:21:56.460\n different technologies to build systems\n\n2:21:56.460 --> 2:21:58.340\n that are much more reliable than the systems\n\n2:21:58.340 --> 2:22:00.420\n that a human being could create.\n\n2:22:00.420 --> 2:22:03.900\n And so in this sense, I would say that\n\n2:22:03.900 --> 2:22:08.340\n if you use an early stage of technology to save labor\n\n2:22:08.340 --> 2:22:11.340\n and don't employ competent people,\n\n2:22:11.340 --> 2:22:14.180\n but just to hack something together because you can,\n\n2:22:14.180 --> 2:22:15.260\n that is very dangerous.\n\n2:22:15.260 --> 2:22:17.220\n And if people are acting under these incentives\n\n2:22:17.220 --> 2:22:20.380\n that they get away with delivering shoddy work\n\n2:22:20.380 --> 2:22:23.980\n more cheaply using AI with less human oversight than before,\n\n2:22:23.980 --> 2:22:25.140\n that's very dangerous.\n\n2:22:25.140 --> 2:22:28.980\n The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable,\n\n2:22:28.980 --> 2:22:30.420\n perhaps less so than humans,\n\n2:22:30.420 --> 2:22:33.820\n but it'll be unreliable in novel ways.\n\n2:22:33.820 --> 2:22:35.340\n And...\n\n2:22:35.340 --> 2:22:37.180\n Yeah, but this is an empirical question.\n\n2:22:37.180 --> 2:22:39.860\n And it's something that we can figure out and work with.\n\n2:22:39.860 --> 2:22:43.100\n So the issue is, do we trust the systems,\n\n2:22:43.100 --> 2:22:45.340\n the social systems that we have in place\n\n2:22:45.340 --> 2:22:48.020\n and the social systems that we can build and maintain\n\n2:22:48.020 --> 2:22:50.420\n that they're able to use AI responsibly?\n\n2:22:50.420 --> 2:22:52.980\n If they can, then AI is good news.\n\n2:22:52.980 --> 2:22:54.100\n If they cannot,\n\n2:22:54.100 --> 2:22:57.220\n then it's going to make the existing problems worse.\n\n2:22:57.220 --> 2:23:00.100\n Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it,\n\n2:23:00.100 --> 2:23:03.140\n who makes money from it because it's ultimately humans.\n\n2:23:03.140 --> 2:23:05.060\n And then you start talking about\n\n2:23:05.060 --> 2:23:06.940\n how much you trust the humans.\n\n2:23:06.940 --> 2:23:08.740\n So the question is, what does who mean?\n\n2:23:08.740 --> 2:23:11.140\n I don't think that we have identity per se.\n\n2:23:11.140 --> 2:23:15.500\n I think that the story of a human being is somewhat random.\n\n2:23:15.500 --> 2:23:18.420\n What happens is more or less that everybody is acting\n\n2:23:18.420 --> 2:23:19.780\n on their local incentives,\n\n2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:21.980\n what they perceive to be their incentives.\n\n2:23:21.980 --> 2:23:24.620\n And the question is, what are the incentives\n\n2:23:24.620 --> 2:23:28.500\n that the one that is pressing the button is operating under?\n\n2:23:28.500 --> 2:23:30.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:23:30.140 --> 2:23:32.620\n It's nice for those incentives to be transparent.\n\n2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:36.060\n So, for example, I'll give you an example.\n\n2:23:36.060 --> 2:23:38.700\n There seems to be a significant distrust\n\n2:23:38.700 --> 2:23:43.700\n of a tech, like entrepreneurs in the tech space\n\n2:23:44.380 --> 2:23:47.380\n or people that run, for example, social media companies\n\n2:23:47.380 --> 2:23:48.940\n like Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n2:23:49.980 --> 2:23:53.060\n There's not a complete transparency of incentives\n\n2:23:53.060 --> 2:23:56.740\n under which that particular human being operates.\n\n2:23:58.940 --> 2:24:00.700\n We can listen to the words he says\n\n2:24:00.700 --> 2:24:02.980\n or what the marketing team says for a company,\n\n2:24:02.980 --> 2:24:04.220\n but we don't know.\n\n2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:08.260\n And that becomes a problem when the algorithms\n\n2:24:08.260 --> 2:24:12.780\n and the systems created by him and other people\n\n2:24:12.780 --> 2:24:15.780\n in that company start having more and more impact\n\n2:24:15.780 --> 2:24:17.180\n on society.\n\n2:24:17.180 --> 2:24:21.940\n And that it starts, if the incentives were somehow\n\n2:24:21.940 --> 2:24:26.020\n the definition and the explainability of the incentives\n\n2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:30.860\n was decentralized such that nobody can manipulate it,\n\n2:24:30.860 --> 2:24:35.580\n no propaganda type manipulation of like\n\n2:24:35.580 --> 2:24:38.020\n how these systems actually operate could be done,\n\n2:24:38.020 --> 2:24:43.020\n then yes, I think AI could achieve much fairer,\n\n2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:50.340\n much more effective sort of like solutions\n\n2:24:50.580 --> 2:24:53.260\n to difficult ethical problems.\n\n2:24:53.260 --> 2:24:55.780\n But when there's like humans in the loop,\n\n2:24:55.780 --> 2:25:00.580\n manipulating the dissemination, the communication\n\n2:25:00.580 --> 2:25:02.420\n of how the system actually works,\n\n2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:05.300\n that feels like you can run into a lot of trouble.\n\n2:25:05.300 --> 2:25:07.740\n And that's why there's currently a lot of distrust\n\n2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:10.180\n for people at the heads of companies\n\n2:25:10.180 --> 2:25:12.660\n that have increasingly powerful AI systems.\n\n2:25:13.900 --> 2:25:16.860\n I suspect what happened traditionally in the US\n\n2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:18.700\n was that since our decision making\n\n2:25:18.700 --> 2:25:22.980\n is much more decentralized than in an authoritarian state,\n\n2:25:22.980 --> 2:25:24.780\n people are making decisions autonomously\n\n2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:26.980\n at many, many levels in a society.\n\n2:25:26.980 --> 2:25:30.260\n What happened that was we created coherence\n\n2:25:30.260 --> 2:25:33.940\n and cohesion in society by controlling what people thought\n\n2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:35.740\n and what information they had.\n\n2:25:35.740 --> 2:25:38.740\n The media synchronized public opinion\n\n2:25:38.740 --> 2:25:40.340\n and social media have disrupted this.\n\n2:25:40.340 --> 2:25:43.780\n It's not, I think so much Russian influence or something,\n\n2:25:43.780 --> 2:25:45.460\n it's everybody's influence.\n\n2:25:45.460 --> 2:25:47.860\n It's that a random person can come up\n\n2:25:47.860 --> 2:25:52.460\n with a conspiracy theory and disrupt what people think.\n\n2:25:52.460 --> 2:25:55.460\n And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling\n\n2:25:55.460 --> 2:25:58.180\n or more attractive than the standardized\n\n2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:01.860\n public conspiracy theory that we give people as a default,\n\n2:26:01.860 --> 2:26:03.460\n then it might get more traction, right?\n\n2:26:03.460 --> 2:26:05.940\n You suddenly have the situation that a single individual\n\n2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:10.060\n somewhere on a farm in Texas has more listeners than CNN.\n\n2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:13.940\n Which particular farmer are you referring to in Texas?\n\n2:26:17.380 --> 2:26:18.220\n Probably no.\n\n2:26:19.180 --> 2:26:21.700\n Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times, okay.\n\n2:26:21.700 --> 2:26:23.420\n Right, it's an interesting situation\n\n2:26:23.420 --> 2:26:25.940\n because you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN\n\n2:26:25.940 --> 2:26:30.420\n if you don't go through a complicated gatekeeping process.\n\n2:26:30.420 --> 2:26:32.460\n And suddenly you have random people\n\n2:26:32.460 --> 2:26:34.900\n without that gatekeeping process,\n\n2:26:34.900 --> 2:26:36.980\n just optimizing for attention.\n\n2:26:36.980 --> 2:26:39.540\n Not necessarily with a lot of responsibility\n\n2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:42.700\n for the longterm effects of projecting these theories\n\n2:26:42.700 --> 2:26:43.900\n into the public.\n\n2:26:43.900 --> 2:26:46.980\n And now there is a push of making social media\n\n2:26:46.980 --> 2:26:48.380\n more like traditional media,\n\n2:26:48.380 --> 2:26:51.380\n which means that the opinion that is being projected\n\n2:26:51.380 --> 2:26:54.660\n in social media is more limited to an acceptable range.\n\n2:26:54.660 --> 2:26:58.380\n With the goal of getting society into safe waters\n\n2:26:58.380 --> 2:27:00.820\n and increase the stability and cohesion of society again,\n\n2:27:00.820 --> 2:27:03.140\n which I think is a laudable goal.\n\n2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:05.100\n But of course it also is an opportunity\n\n2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:08.340\n to seize the means of indoctrination.\n\n2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:11.420\n And the incentives that people are under when they do this\n\n2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:16.420\n are in such a way that the AI ethics that we would need\n\n2:27:17.140 --> 2:27:20.620\n becomes very often something like AI politics,\n\n2:27:20.620 --> 2:27:23.380\n which is basically partisan and ideological.\n\n2:27:23.380 --> 2:27:26.180\n And this means that whatever one side says,\n\n2:27:26.180 --> 2:27:28.380\n another side is going to be disagreeing with, right?\n\n2:27:28.380 --> 2:27:31.740\n In the same way as when you turn masks or the vaccine\n\n2:27:31.740 --> 2:27:33.140\n into a political issue,\n\n2:27:33.140 --> 2:27:35.700\n if you say that it is politically virtuous\n\n2:27:35.700 --> 2:27:36.660\n to get vaccinated,\n\n2:27:36.660 --> 2:27:39.260\n it will mean that the people that don't like you\n\n2:27:39.260 --> 2:27:41.020\n will not want to get vaccinated, right?\n\n2:27:41.020 --> 2:27:43.620\n And as soon as you have this partisan discourse,\n\n2:27:43.620 --> 2:27:47.140\n it's going to be very hard to make the right decisions\n\n2:27:47.140 --> 2:27:48.860\n because the incentives get to be the wrong ones.\n\n2:27:48.860 --> 2:27:51.180\n AI ethics needs to be super boring.\n\n2:27:51.180 --> 2:27:53.300\n It needs to be done by people who do statistics\n\n2:27:53.300 --> 2:27:56.540\n all the time and have extremely boring,\n\n2:27:56.540 --> 2:27:59.620\n long winded discussions that most people cannot follow\n\n2:27:59.620 --> 2:28:00.900\n because they are too complicated,\n\n2:28:00.900 --> 2:28:02.540\n but that are dead serious.\n\n2:28:02.540 --> 2:28:05.820\n These people need to be able to be better at statistics\n\n2:28:05.820 --> 2:28:07.940\n than the leading machine learning researchers.\n\n2:28:07.940 --> 2:28:12.060\n And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one\n\n2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:14.460\n where you don't have any barrier to entry, right?\n\n2:28:14.460 --> 2:28:16.820\n Everybody who has a strong opinion\n\n2:28:16.820 --> 2:28:18.860\n and is able to signal that opinion in the right way\n\n2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:19.700\n can enter it.\n\n2:28:19.700 --> 2:28:24.340\n And to me, that is a very frustrating thing\n\n2:28:24.340 --> 2:28:26.260\n because the field is so crucially important\n\n2:28:26.260 --> 2:28:27.100\n to our future.\n\n2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:28.260\n It's so crucially important,\n\n2:28:28.260 --> 2:28:31.860\n but the only qualification you currently need\n\n2:28:31.860 --> 2:28:34.740\n is to be outraged by the injustice in the world.\n\n2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:36.220\n It's more complicated, right?\n\n2:28:36.220 --> 2:28:37.860\n Everybody seems to be outraged.\n\n2:28:37.860 --> 2:28:40.740\n But let's just say that the incentives\n\n2:28:40.740 --> 2:28:42.020\n are not always the right ones.\n\n2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:45.500\n So basically, I suspect that a lot of people\n\n2:28:45.500 --> 2:28:48.140\n that enter this debate don't have a vision\n\n2:28:48.140 --> 2:28:50.020\n for what society should be looking like\n\n2:28:50.020 --> 2:28:51.380\n in a way that is nonviolent,\n\n2:28:51.380 --> 2:28:53.580\n where we preserve liberal democracy,\n\n2:28:53.580 --> 2:28:56.300\n where we make sure that we all get along\n\n2:28:56.300 --> 2:29:00.420\n and we are around in a few hundred years from now,\n\n2:29:00.420 --> 2:29:02.180\n preferably with a comfortable\n\n2:29:02.180 --> 2:29:04.820\n technological civilization around us.\n\n2:29:04.820 --> 2:29:09.820\n I generally have a very foggy view of that world,\n\n2:29:10.060 --> 2:29:12.060\n but I tend to try to follow,\n\n2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:13.900\n and I think society should in some degree\n\n2:29:13.900 --> 2:29:16.340\n follow the gradient of love,\n\n2:29:16.340 --> 2:29:18.940\n increasing the amount of love in the world.\n\n2:29:18.940 --> 2:29:21.100\n And whenever I see different policies\n\n2:29:21.100 --> 2:29:24.460\n or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so,\n\n2:29:24.460 --> 2:29:27.900\n obviously, that's the ones that kind of resist.\n\n2:29:27.900 --> 2:29:30.740\n So the thing that terrifies me about this notion\n\n2:29:30.740 --> 2:29:34.740\n is I think that German fascism was driven by love.\n\n2:29:35.660 --> 2:29:37.820\n It was just a very selective love.\n\n2:29:37.820 --> 2:29:39.140\n It was a love that basically...\n\n2:29:39.140 --> 2:29:40.460\n Now you're just manipulating.\n\n2:29:40.460 --> 2:29:45.460\n I mean, that's, you have to be very careful.\n\n2:29:45.460 --> 2:29:50.460\n You're talking to the wrong person in this way about love.\n\n2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:52.540\n So let's talk about what love is.\n\n2:29:52.540 --> 2:29:55.980\n And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.\n\n2:29:55.980 --> 2:29:59.700\n It's the recognition of the sacred in the other.\n\n2:29:59.700 --> 2:30:02.780\n And this enables non transactional interactions.\n\n2:30:02.780 --> 2:30:07.740\n But the size of the other that you include\n\n2:30:07.740 --> 2:30:09.740\n needs to be maximized.\n\n2:30:09.740 --> 2:30:14.700\n So it's basically appreciation,\n\n2:30:14.700 --> 2:30:19.700\n like deep appreciation of the world around you fully,\n\n2:30:23.540 --> 2:30:25.940\n including the people that are very different than you,\n\n2:30:25.940 --> 2:30:27.700\n people that disagree with you completely,\n\n2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:30.180\n including people, including living creatures\n\n2:30:30.180 --> 2:30:33.460\n outside of just people, including ideas.\n\n2:30:33.460 --> 2:30:36.580\n And it's like appreciation of the full mess of it.\n\n2:30:36.580 --> 2:30:39.180\n And also it has to do with like empathy,\n\n2:30:40.380 --> 2:30:44.020\n which is coupled with a lack of confidence\n\n2:30:44.020 --> 2:30:47.140\n and certainty of your own rightness.\n\n2:30:47.140 --> 2:30:51.140\n It's like a radical open mindedness to the way forward.\n\n2:30:51.140 --> 2:30:53.460\n I agree with every part of what you said.\n\n2:30:53.460 --> 2:30:54.980\n And now if you scale it up,\n\n2:30:54.980 --> 2:30:58.540\n what you recognize is that Lafist is in some sense,\n\n2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:01.380\n the service to next level agency,\n\n2:31:01.380 --> 2:31:04.220\n to the highest level agency that you can recognize.\n\n2:31:04.220 --> 2:31:07.860\n It could be for instance, life on earth or beyond that,\n\n2:31:07.860 --> 2:31:11.620\n where you could say intelligent complexity in the universe\n\n2:31:11.620 --> 2:31:14.100\n that you try to maximize in a certain way.\n\n2:31:14.100 --> 2:31:15.860\n But when you think it's true,\n\n2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:17.820\n it basically means a certain aesthetic.\n\n2:31:18.980 --> 2:31:20.820\n And there is not one possible aesthetic,\n\n2:31:20.820 --> 2:31:22.660\n there are many possible aesthetics.\n\n2:31:22.660 --> 2:31:25.420\n And once you project an aesthetic into the future,\n\n2:31:25.420 --> 2:31:29.260\n you can see that there are some which defect from it,\n\n2:31:29.260 --> 2:31:30.900\n which are in conflict with it,\n\n2:31:30.900 --> 2:31:32.500\n that are corrupt, that are evil.\n\n2:31:33.860 --> 2:31:37.100\n You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil\n\n2:31:37.100 --> 2:31:39.980\n because the aesthetic of the world that he wanted\n\n2:31:39.980 --> 2:31:41.940\n is in conflict with the aesthetic of the world\n\n2:31:41.940 --> 2:31:43.340\n that you and me have in mind.\n\n2:31:44.540 --> 2:31:48.500\n And so they think that he destroyed,\n\n2:31:48.500 --> 2:31:50.660\n we want to keep them in the world.\n\n2:31:50.660 --> 2:31:55.220\n There's a kind of, there's kind of ways to deal,\n\n2:31:55.220 --> 2:31:56.660\n I mean, Hitler is an easier case,\n\n2:31:56.660 --> 2:31:59.180\n but perhaps he wasn't so easy in the 30s, right?\n\n2:31:59.180 --> 2:32:02.380\n To understand who is Hitler and who is not.\n\n2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:04.580\n No, it was just there was no consensus\n\n2:32:04.580 --> 2:32:07.500\n that the aesthetics that he had in mind were unacceptable.\n\n2:32:07.500 --> 2:32:12.500\n Yeah, I mean, it's difficult, love is complicated\n\n2:32:12.900 --> 2:32:17.300\n because you can't just be so open minded\n\n2:32:17.300 --> 2:32:20.660\n that you let evil walk into the door,\n\n2:32:20.660 --> 2:32:24.420\n but you can't be so self assured\n\n2:32:24.420 --> 2:32:29.420\n that you can always identify evil perfectly\n\n2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:32.620\n because that's what leads to Nazi Germany.\n\n2:32:32.620 --> 2:32:34.860\n Having a certainty of what is and wasn't evil,\n\n2:32:34.860 --> 2:32:37.540\n like always drawing lines of good versus evil.\n\n2:32:38.660 --> 2:32:42.940\n There seems to be, there has to be a dance\n\n2:32:42.940 --> 2:32:47.940\n between like hard stances extending up\n\n2:32:49.900 --> 2:32:51.340\n against what is wrong.\n\n2:32:51.340 --> 2:32:55.420\n And at the same time, empathy and open mindedness\n\n2:32:55.420 --> 2:32:59.580\n of towards not knowing what is right and wrong\n\n2:32:59.580 --> 2:33:01.420\n and like a dance between those.\n\n2:33:01.420 --> 2:33:03.620\n I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies\n\n2:33:03.620 --> 2:33:06.060\n that there is nobody who captures my spirituality\n\n2:33:06.060 --> 2:33:07.940\n as well as he does.\n\n2:33:07.940 --> 2:33:10.620\n It's very interesting and just vicious, right?\n\n2:33:10.620 --> 2:33:13.100\n There is something going on in his movies\n\n2:33:13.100 --> 2:33:14.140\n that is very interesting.\n\n2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:17.140\n So for instance, Mononoke is discussing\n\n2:33:17.140 --> 2:33:22.140\n not only an answer to Disney's simplistic notion of Mowgli,\n\n2:33:22.380 --> 2:33:24.980\n the jungle boy was raised by wolves.\n\n2:33:24.980 --> 2:33:27.780\n And as soon as he sees people realizes that he's one of them\n\n2:33:27.780 --> 2:33:32.780\n and the way in which the moral life and nature\n\n2:33:32.780 --> 2:33:36.020\n is simplified and romanticized and turned into kitsch.\n\n2:33:36.020 --> 2:33:37.700\n It's disgusting in the Disney movie.\n\n2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:39.820\n And he answers to this, you see,\n\n2:33:39.820 --> 2:33:42.260\n he's replaced by Mononoke, this wolf girl\n\n2:33:42.260 --> 2:33:44.860\n who was raised by wolves and was fierce and dangerous\n\n2:33:44.860 --> 2:33:48.780\n and who cannot be socialized because she cannot be tamed.\n\n2:33:48.780 --> 2:33:50.460\n You cannot be part of human society.\n\n2:33:50.460 --> 2:33:51.900\n And you see human society,\n\n2:33:51.900 --> 2:33:53.700\n it's something that is very, very complicated.\n\n2:33:53.700 --> 2:33:57.780\n You see people extracting resources and destroying nature.\n\n2:33:57.780 --> 2:34:00.740\n But the purpose is not to be evil,\n\n2:34:00.740 --> 2:34:04.740\n but to be able to have a life that is free from,\n\n2:34:04.740 --> 2:34:07.140\n for instance, oppression and violence\n\n2:34:07.140 --> 2:34:10.860\n and to curb death and disease.\n\n2:34:10.860 --> 2:34:13.260\n And you basically see this conflict\n\n2:34:13.260 --> 2:34:15.180\n which cannot be resolved in a certain way.\n\n2:34:15.180 --> 2:34:18.340\n You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden\n\n2:34:18.340 --> 2:34:20.980\n and it loses most of what it actually is\n\n2:34:20.980 --> 2:34:23.420\n and humans no longer submitting to life and death\n\n2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:26.820\n and nature and to these questions, there is no easy answer.\n\n2:34:26.820 --> 2:34:29.980\n So it just turns it into something that is being observed\n\n2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:31.180\n as a journey that happens.\n\n2:34:31.180 --> 2:34:34.940\n And that happens with a certain degree of inevitability.\n\n2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:37.100\n And the nice thing about all his movies\n\n2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:38.740\n is there's a certain main character\n\n2:34:38.740 --> 2:34:41.260\n and it's the same in all movies.\n\n2:34:41.260 --> 2:34:45.740\n It's this little girl that is basically Heidi.\n\n2:34:45.740 --> 2:34:50.540\n And I suspect that happened because when he did field work\n\n2:34:50.540 --> 2:34:53.020\n for working on the Heidi movies back then,\n\n2:34:53.020 --> 2:34:55.700\n the Heidi animations, before he did his own movies,\n\n2:34:55.700 --> 2:35:00.220\n he traveled to Switzerland and South Eastern Europe\n\n2:35:00.220 --> 2:35:03.220\n and the Adriatic and so on and got an idea\n\n2:35:03.220 --> 2:35:05.340\n about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life\n\n2:35:05.340 --> 2:35:08.140\n that informed his future thinking.\n\n2:35:08.140 --> 2:35:11.020\n And Heidi has a very interesting relationship\n\n2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:13.300\n to herself and to the world.\n\n2:35:13.300 --> 2:35:15.940\n There's nothing that she takes for herself.\n\n2:35:15.940 --> 2:35:18.780\n She's in a way fearless because she is committed\n\n2:35:18.780 --> 2:35:20.860\n to a service, to a greater whole.\n\n2:35:20.860 --> 2:35:24.100\n Basically, she is completely committed to serving God.\n\n2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:26.300\n And it's not an institutionalized God.\n\n2:35:26.300 --> 2:35:28.500\n It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church\n\n2:35:28.500 --> 2:35:30.420\n or something like this.\n\n2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:32.660\n But in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment\n\n2:35:32.660 --> 2:35:34.940\n of the spirit of European Protestantism.\n\n2:35:35.780 --> 2:35:38.780\n It's this idea of a being that is completely perfect\n\n2:35:38.780 --> 2:35:40.180\n and pure.\n\n2:35:40.180 --> 2:35:42.060\n And it's not a feminist vision\n\n2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:47.060\n because she is not a girl boss or something like this.\n\n2:35:48.620 --> 2:35:52.460\n She is the justification for the men in the audience\n\n2:35:52.460 --> 2:35:54.780\n to protect her, to build a civilization around her\n\n2:35:54.780 --> 2:35:56.580\n that makes her possible.\n\n2:35:56.580 --> 2:35:59.260\n So she is not just the sacrifice of Jesus\n\n2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:02.740\n who is innocent and therefore nailed to the cross.\n\n2:36:02.740 --> 2:36:04.060\n She is not being sacrificed.\n\n2:36:04.060 --> 2:36:07.020\n She is being protected by everybody around her\n\n2:36:07.020 --> 2:36:08.620\n who recognizes that she is sacred.\n\n2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:12.060\n And there are enough around her to see that.\n\n2:36:12.060 --> 2:36:14.020\n So this is a very interesting perspective.\n\n2:36:14.020 --> 2:36:16.340\n There's a certain notion of innocence.\n\n2:36:16.340 --> 2:36:18.500\n And this notion of innocence is not universal.\n\n2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:20.140\n It's not in all cultures.\n\n2:36:20.140 --> 2:36:21.500\n Hitler wasn't innocent.\n\n2:36:21.500 --> 2:36:25.620\n His idea of Germany was not that there is an innocence\n\n2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:26.900\n that is being protected.\n\n2:36:26.900 --> 2:36:29.700\n There was a predator that was going to triumph.\n\n2:36:29.700 --> 2:36:31.420\n And it's also something that is not at the core\n\n2:36:31.420 --> 2:36:32.260\n of every religion.\n\n2:36:32.260 --> 2:36:34.860\n There are many religions which don't care about innocence.\n\n2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:39.860\n They might care about increasing the status of something.\n\n2:36:41.020 --> 2:36:44.980\n And that's a very interesting notion that is quite unique\n\n2:36:44.980 --> 2:36:47.620\n and not claiming it's the optimal one.\n\n2:36:47.620 --> 2:36:49.940\n It's just a particular kind of aesthetic\n\n2:36:49.940 --> 2:36:51.780\n which I think makes Miyazaki\n\n2:36:51.780 --> 2:36:55.500\n into the most relevant Protestant philosopher today.\n\n2:36:55.500 --> 2:36:59.780\n And you're saying in terms of all the ways\n\n2:36:59.780 --> 2:37:02.020\n that a society can operate perhaps the preservation\n\n2:37:02.020 --> 2:37:07.020\n of innocence might be one of the best.\n\n2:37:07.140 --> 2:37:09.780\n No, it's just my aesthetic.\n\n2:37:09.780 --> 2:37:13.620\n So it's a particular way in which I feel\n\n2:37:13.620 --> 2:37:15.420\n that I relate to the world that is natural\n\n2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:16.700\n to my own socialization.\n\n2:37:16.700 --> 2:37:18.300\n And maybe it's not an accident\n\n2:37:18.300 --> 2:37:21.140\n that I have cultural roots in Europe\n\n2:37:22.380 --> 2:37:23.380\n in a particular world.\n\n2:37:23.380 --> 2:37:26.620\n And so maybe it's a natural convergence point\n\n2:37:26.620 --> 2:37:28.500\n and it's not something that you will find\n\n2:37:28.500 --> 2:37:30.980\n in all other times in history.\n\n2:37:30.980 --> 2:37:33.980\n So I'd like to ask you about Solzhenitsyn\n\n2:37:33.980 --> 2:37:38.980\n and our individual role as ants in this very large society.\n\n2:37:39.460 --> 2:37:42.060\n So he says that some version of the line\n\n2:37:42.060 --> 2:37:44.700\n between good and evil runs to the heart of every man.\n\n2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:47.340\n Do you think all of us are capable of good and evil?\n\n2:37:47.340 --> 2:37:50.820\n Like what's our role in this play\n\n2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:55.580\n in this game we're all playing?\n\n2:37:55.580 --> 2:37:57.940\n Is all of us capable to play any role?\n\n2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:00.980\n Like, is there an ultimate responsibility\n\n2:38:00.980 --> 2:38:04.300\n to you mentioned maintaining innocence\n\n2:38:04.300 --> 2:38:09.140\n or whatever the highest ideal for a society you want\n\n2:38:09.140 --> 2:38:11.540\n are all of us capable of living up to that?\n\n2:38:11.540 --> 2:38:13.340\n And that's our responsibility\n\n2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:15.900\n or is there significant limitations\n\n2:38:15.900 --> 2:38:18.780\n to what we're able to do in terms of good and evil?\n\n2:38:21.340 --> 2:38:24.060\n So there is a certain way if you are not terrible,\n\n2:38:24.060 --> 2:38:29.060\n if you are committed to some kind of civilizational agency,\n\n2:38:29.460 --> 2:38:31.140\n a next level agent that you are serving,\n\n2:38:31.140 --> 2:38:33.140\n some kind of transcendent principle.\n\n2:38:34.260 --> 2:38:36.300\n In the eyes of that transcendental principle,\n\n2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:38.060\n you are able to discern good from evil.\n\n2:38:38.060 --> 2:38:39.020\n Otherwise you cannot,\n\n2:38:39.020 --> 2:38:41.660\n otherwise you have just individual aesthetics.\n\n2:38:41.660 --> 2:38:44.060\n The cat that is torturing a mouse is not evil\n\n2:38:44.060 --> 2:38:46.340\n because the cat does not envision\n\n2:38:46.340 --> 2:38:50.660\n or no part of the world of the cat is envisioning a world\n\n2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:53.740\n where there is no violence and nobody is suffering.\n\n2:38:53.740 --> 2:38:55.500\n If you have an aesthetic where you want\n\n2:38:55.500 --> 2:38:56.940\n to protect innocence,\n\n2:38:56.940 --> 2:39:00.020\n then torturing somebody needlessly is evil,\n\n2:39:00.900 --> 2:39:01.900\n but only then.\n\n2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:05.660\n No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic,\n\n2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:10.260\n like within your sense of what is good and evil,\n\n2:39:10.260 --> 2:39:14.460\n are we still, it seems like we're still able\n\n2:39:14.460 --> 2:39:17.140\n to commit evil.\n\n2:39:17.140 --> 2:39:19.340\n Yes, so basically if you are committing\n\n2:39:19.340 --> 2:39:20.820\n to this next level agent,\n\n2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:23.580\n you are not necessarily are this next level agent, right?\n\n2:39:23.580 --> 2:39:24.420\n You are a part of it.\n\n2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:26.020\n You have a relationship to it,\n\n2:39:26.020 --> 2:39:29.700\n like the cell does to its organism, its hyperorganism.\n\n2:39:29.700 --> 2:39:31.340\n And it only exists to the degree\n\n2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:34.580\n that it's being implemented by you and others.\n\n2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:38.540\n And that means that you're not completely fully serving it.\n\n2:39:38.540 --> 2:39:40.340\n You have freedom in what you decide,\n\n2:39:40.340 --> 2:39:42.100\n whether you are acting on your impulses\n\n2:39:42.100 --> 2:39:44.500\n and local incentives and your farewell impulses,\n\n2:39:44.500 --> 2:39:47.140\n so to speak, or whether you're committing to it.\n\n2:39:47.140 --> 2:39:49.980\n And what you perceive then is a tension\n\n2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:53.100\n between what you would be doing with respect\n\n2:39:53.100 --> 2:39:57.300\n to the thing that you recognize as the sacred, if you do,\n\n2:39:57.300 --> 2:39:58.820\n and what you're actually doing.\n\n2:39:58.820 --> 2:40:01.460\n And this is the line between good and evil,\n\n2:40:01.460 --> 2:40:03.100\n right where you see, oh, I'm here acting\n\n2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:05.700\n on my local incentives or impulses,\n\n2:40:05.700 --> 2:40:08.100\n and here I'm acting on what I consider to be sacred.\n\n2:40:08.100 --> 2:40:09.780\n And there's a tension between those.\n\n2:40:09.780 --> 2:40:11.940\n And this is the line between good and evil\n\n2:40:11.940 --> 2:40:14.380\n that might run through your heart.\n\n2:40:14.380 --> 2:40:15.700\n And if you don't have that,\n\n2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:17.180\n if you don't have this relationship\n\n2:40:17.180 --> 2:40:18.660\n to a transcendental agent,\n\n2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:19.980\n you could call this relationship\n\n2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:21.700\n to the next level agent soul, right?\n\n2:40:21.700 --> 2:40:22.540\n It's not a thing.\n\n2:40:22.540 --> 2:40:25.780\n It's not an immortal thing that is intrinsically valuable.\n\n2:40:25.780 --> 2:40:27.460\n It's a certain kind of relationship\n\n2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:29.580\n that you project to understand what's happening.\n\n2:40:29.580 --> 2:40:31.900\n Somebody is serving this transcendental sacredness\n\n2:40:31.900 --> 2:40:33.220\n or they're not.\n\n2:40:33.220 --> 2:40:35.860\n If you don't have a soul, you cannot be evil.\n\n2:40:35.860 --> 2:40:39.620\n You're just a complex natural phenomenon.\n\n2:40:39.620 --> 2:40:42.140\n So if you look at life, like starting today\n\n2:40:42.140 --> 2:40:45.140\n or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today,\n\n2:40:46.020 --> 2:40:48.180\n there's a bunch of trajectories\n\n2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:53.180\n that you can take through life, maybe countless.\n\n2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:57.300\n Do you think some of these trajectories,\n\n2:40:57.300 --> 2:40:59.700\n in your own conception of yourself,\n\n2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:04.220\n some of those trajectories are the ideal life,\n\n2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:09.220\n a life that if you were to be the hero of your life story,\n\n2:41:09.620 --> 2:41:10.860\n you would want to be?\n\n2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:14.500\n Like, is there some Josh or Bhakti you're striving to be?\n\n2:41:14.500 --> 2:41:15.980\n Like, this is the question I ask myself\n\n2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:20.260\n as an individual trying to make a better world\n\n2:41:20.260 --> 2:41:22.540\n in the best way that I could conceive of.\n\n2:41:22.540 --> 2:41:24.660\n What is my responsibility there?\n\n2:41:24.660 --> 2:41:28.260\n And how much am I responsible for the failure to do so?\n\n2:41:28.260 --> 2:41:33.260\n Because I'm lazy and incompetent too often.\n\n2:41:33.260 --> 2:41:35.740\n In my own perception.\n\n2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:38.260\n In my own worldview, I'm not very important.\n\n2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:41.540\n So it's, I don't have place for me as a hero\n\n2:41:41.540 --> 2:41:42.460\n in my own world.\n\n2:41:43.460 --> 2:41:45.980\n I'm trying to do the best that I can,\n\n2:41:45.980 --> 2:41:48.060\n which is often not very good.\n\n2:41:48.060 --> 2:41:52.820\n And so it's not important for me to have status\n\n2:41:52.820 --> 2:41:55.500\n or to be seen in a particular way.\n\n2:41:55.500 --> 2:41:57.380\n It's helpful if others can see me\n\n2:41:57.380 --> 2:41:59.780\n or a few people can see me that can be my friends.\n\n2:41:59.780 --> 2:42:01.460\n No, sorry, I want to clarify,\n\n2:42:01.460 --> 2:42:05.220\n the hero I didn't mean status or perception\n\n2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:09.660\n or like some kind of marketing thing,\n\n2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:13.180\n but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind.\n\n2:42:14.060 --> 2:42:15.980\n Is there the kind of man you want to be\n\n2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:20.460\n and would consider it a failure if you don't become that?\n\n2:42:20.460 --> 2:42:21.940\n That's what I meant by hero.\n\n2:42:21.940 --> 2:42:23.300\n Yeah, not really.\n\n2:42:23.300 --> 2:42:26.140\n I don't perceive myself as having such an identity.\n\n2:42:26.140 --> 2:42:30.420\n And it's also sometimes frustrating,\n\n2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:37.340\n but it's basically a lack of having this notion\n\n2:42:37.940 --> 2:42:40.620\n of father that I need to be emulating.\n\n2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:44.980\n It's interesting.\n\n2:42:44.980 --> 2:42:47.220\n I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river.\n\n2:42:48.660 --> 2:42:50.220\n I worry that...\n\n2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:55.220\n Sometimes it's more like being the river.\n\n2:42:59.020 --> 2:43:02.740\n I'm just a fat frog sitting on a leaf\n\n2:43:02.740 --> 2:43:06.620\n on a dirty, muddy lake.\n\n2:43:06.620 --> 2:43:11.620\n I wish I was waiting for a princess to kiss me.\n\n2:43:13.540 --> 2:43:15.780\n Or the other way, I forgot which way it goes.\n\n2:43:15.780 --> 2:43:17.180\n Somebody kisses somebody.\n\n2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:20.420\n I can ask you, I don't know if you know\n\n2:43:20.420 --> 2:43:21.700\n who Michael Malice is,\n\n2:43:21.700 --> 2:43:26.700\n but in terms of constructing since systems of incentives,\n\n2:43:27.060 --> 2:43:29.540\n it's interesting to ask.\n\n2:43:29.540 --> 2:43:32.140\n I don't think I've talked to you about this before.\n\n2:43:33.060 --> 2:43:35.700\n Malice espouses anarchism.\n\n2:43:35.700 --> 2:43:38.460\n So he sees all government as fundamentally\n\n2:43:40.660 --> 2:43:42.940\n getting in the way or even being destructive\n\n2:43:42.940 --> 2:43:47.940\n to collaborations between human beings thriving.\n\n2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:50.500\n What do you think?\n\n2:43:50.500 --> 2:43:55.500\n What's the role of government in a society that thrives?\n\n2:43:56.900 --> 2:44:00.580\n Is anarchism at all compelling to you as a system?\n\n2:44:00.580 --> 2:44:02.980\n So like not just small government,\n\n2:44:02.980 --> 2:44:04.340\n but no government at all.\n\n2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:07.940\n Yeah, I don't see how this would work.\n\n2:44:09.860 --> 2:44:12.700\n The government is an agent that imposes an offset\n\n2:44:12.700 --> 2:44:15.580\n on your reward function, on your payout metrics.\n\n2:44:15.580 --> 2:44:19.500\n So your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.\n\n2:44:20.860 --> 2:44:25.620\n So the argument there is that you can have collectives\n\n2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:28.620\n like governing organizations, but not government,\n\n2:44:28.620 --> 2:44:32.540\n like where you're born in a particular set of land\n\n2:44:32.540 --> 2:44:37.540\n and therefore you must follow this rule or else.\n\n2:44:38.420 --> 2:44:41.820\n You're forced by what they call violence\n\n2:44:41.820 --> 2:44:44.900\n because there's an implied violence here.\n\n2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:49.900\n So the key aspect of government is it protects you\n\n2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:56.700\n from the rest of the world with an army and with police.\n\n2:44:56.700 --> 2:45:00.020\n So it has a monopoly on violence.\n\n2:45:00.020 --> 2:45:02.060\n It's the only one that's able to do violence.\n\n2:45:02.060 --> 2:45:03.540\n So there are many forms of government,\n\n2:45:03.540 --> 2:45:05.020\n not all governments do that.\n\n2:45:05.020 --> 2:45:09.660\n But we find that in successful countries,\n\n2:45:09.660 --> 2:45:11.860\n the government has a monopoly on violence.\n\n2:45:12.740 --> 2:45:15.700\n And that means that you cannot get ahead\n\n2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:17.740\n by starting your own army because the government\n\n2:45:17.740 --> 2:45:19.340\n will come down on you and destroy you\n\n2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:20.940\n if you try to do that.\n\n2:45:20.940 --> 2:45:23.260\n And in countries where you can build your own army\n\n2:45:23.260 --> 2:45:25.700\n and get away with it, some people will do it.\n\n2:45:25.700 --> 2:45:28.580\n And these countries is what we call failed countries\n\n2:45:28.580 --> 2:45:30.060\n in a way.\n\n2:45:30.060 --> 2:45:33.500\n And if you don't want to have violence,\n\n2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:36.860\n the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions of people\n\n2:45:36.860 --> 2:45:39.180\n because some people will use strategies\n\n2:45:39.180 --> 2:45:41.820\n if they get ahead with them that feel a particular kind\n\n2:45:41.820 --> 2:45:42.740\n of ecological niche.\n\n2:45:42.740 --> 2:45:45.260\n So you need to destroy that ecological niche.\n\n2:45:45.260 --> 2:45:50.060\n And if effective government has a monopoly on violence,\n\n2:45:50.060 --> 2:45:53.460\n it can create a world where nobody is able to use violence\n\n2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:54.820\n and get ahead.\n\n2:45:54.820 --> 2:45:57.060\n So you want to use that monopoly on violence,\n\n2:45:57.060 --> 2:46:00.100\n not to exert violence, but to make violence impossible,\n\n2:46:00.100 --> 2:46:02.140\n to raise the cost of violence.\n\n2:46:02.140 --> 2:46:06.100\n So people need to get ahead with nonviolent means.\n\n2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:09.300\n So the idea is that you might be able to achieve that\n\n2:46:09.300 --> 2:46:12.220\n in an anarchist state with companies.\n\n2:46:12.220 --> 2:46:17.220\n So with the forces of capitalism is create security companies\n\n2:46:18.260 --> 2:46:21.980\n where the one that's most ethically sound rises to the top.\n\n2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:24.220\n Basically, it would be a much better representative\n\n2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:29.220\n of the people because there is a less sort of stickiness\n\n2:46:29.220 --> 2:46:33.220\n to the big military force sticking around\n\n2:46:33.220 --> 2:46:36.420\n even though it's long overlived, outlived.\n\n2:46:36.420 --> 2:46:40.060\n So you have groups of militants that are hopefully\n\n2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:41.940\n efficiently organized because otherwise they're going\n\n2:46:41.940 --> 2:46:44.580\n to lose against the other groups of militants\n\n2:46:44.580 --> 2:46:47.060\n and they are coordinating themselves with the rest\n\n2:46:47.060 --> 2:46:51.220\n of society until they are having a monopoly on violence.\n\n2:46:51.220 --> 2:46:53.940\n How is that different from a government?\n\n2:46:53.940 --> 2:46:56.220\n So it's basically converging to the same thing.\n\n2:46:56.220 --> 2:47:00.020\n So I was trying to argue with Malice,\n\n2:47:00.020 --> 2:47:03.060\n I feel like it always converges towards government at scale,\n\n2:47:03.060 --> 2:47:06.100\n but I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives\n\n2:47:06.100 --> 2:47:11.100\n that are, you basically never let anything scale too big.\n\n2:47:11.820 --> 2:47:15.460\n So one of the problems with governments is it gets too big\n\n2:47:15.460 --> 2:47:19.820\n in terms of like the size of the group\n\n2:47:19.820 --> 2:47:21.540\n over which it has control.\n\n2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:25.940\n My sense is that would happen anyway.\n\n2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:30.660\n So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook,\n\n2:47:30.660 --> 2:47:33.060\n I mean, it starts forming a monopoly\n\n2:47:33.060 --> 2:47:36.060\n over the entire populations,\n\n2:47:36.060 --> 2:47:37.900\n not over just the hundreds of millions,\n\n2:47:37.900 --> 2:47:39.340\n but billions of people.\n\n2:47:39.340 --> 2:47:43.540\n So I don't know, but there is something\n\n2:47:43.540 --> 2:47:46.060\n about the abuses of power the government can have\n\n2:47:46.060 --> 2:47:49.020\n when it has a monopoly on violence, right?\n\n2:47:49.020 --> 2:47:53.020\n And so that's a tension there, but...\n\n2:47:53.020 --> 2:47:55.180\n So the question is how can you set the incentives\n\n2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:56.420\n for government correctly?\n\n2:47:56.420 --> 2:47:59.940\n And this mostly applies at the highest levels of government\n\n2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:02.940\n and because we haven't found a way to set them correctly,\n\n2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:06.300\n we made the highest levels of government relatively weak.\n\n2:48:06.300 --> 2:48:08.580\n And this is, I think, part of the reason\n\n2:48:08.580 --> 2:48:12.260\n why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic response\n\n2:48:12.260 --> 2:48:14.940\n and China didn't have that much difficulty.\n\n2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:17.500\n And there is, of course, a much higher risk\n\n2:48:17.500 --> 2:48:19.980\n of the abuse of power that exists in China\n\n2:48:19.980 --> 2:48:22.740\n because the power is largely unchecked.\n\n2:48:22.740 --> 2:48:25.260\n And that's basically what happens\n\n2:48:25.260 --> 2:48:26.540\n in the next generation, for instance.\n\n2:48:26.540 --> 2:48:28.380\n Imagine that we would agree\n\n2:48:28.380 --> 2:48:30.460\n that the current government of China is largely correct\n\n2:48:30.460 --> 2:48:33.180\n and benevolent, and maybe we don't agree on this,\n\n2:48:33.180 --> 2:48:36.100\n but if we did, how can we make sure\n\n2:48:36.100 --> 2:48:37.540\n that this stays like this?\n\n2:48:37.540 --> 2:48:40.300\n And if you don't have checks and balances,\n\n2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:42.980\n division of power, it's hard to achieve.\n\n2:48:42.980 --> 2:48:45.300\n You don't have a solution for that problem.\n\n2:48:45.300 --> 2:48:47.420\n But the abolishment of government\n\n2:48:47.420 --> 2:48:49.540\n basically would remove the control structure.\n\n2:48:49.540 --> 2:48:51.540\n From a cybernetic perspective,\n\n2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:54.740\n there is an optimal point in the system\n\n2:48:54.740 --> 2:48:56.460\n that the regulation should be happening, right?\n\n2:48:56.460 --> 2:48:59.780\n That you can measure the current incentives\n\n2:48:59.780 --> 2:49:01.940\n and the regulator would be properly incentivized\n\n2:49:01.940 --> 2:49:03.740\n to make the right decisions\n\n2:49:03.740 --> 2:49:06.340\n and change the payout metrics of everything below it\n\n2:49:06.340 --> 2:49:08.620\n in such a way that the local prisoners dilemmas\n\n2:49:08.620 --> 2:49:09.900\n get resolved, right?\n\n2:49:09.900 --> 2:49:12.060\n You cannot resolve the prisoners dilemma\n\n2:49:12.060 --> 2:49:14.100\n without some kind of eternal control\n\n2:49:14.900 --> 2:49:17.300\n that emulates an infinite game in a way.\n\n2:49:19.060 --> 2:49:22.380\n Yeah, I mean, there's a sense in which\n\n2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:24.940\n it seems like the reason government,\n\n2:49:24.940 --> 2:49:27.780\n the parts of government that don't work well currently\n\n2:49:27.780 --> 2:49:32.020\n is because there's not good mechanisms\n\n2:49:34.020 --> 2:49:35.380\n through which to interact,\n\n2:49:35.380 --> 2:49:37.300\n for the citizenry to interact with government\n\n2:49:37.300 --> 2:49:41.500\n is basically it hasn't caught up in terms of technology.\n\n2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:43.860\n And I think once you integrate\n\n2:49:43.860 --> 2:49:46.100\n some of the digital revolution\n\n2:49:46.100 --> 2:49:48.420\n of being able to have a lot of access to data,\n\n2:49:48.420 --> 2:49:52.060\n be able to vote on different ideas at a local level,\n\n2:49:52.060 --> 2:49:54.780\n at all levels, at the optimal level\n\n2:49:54.780 --> 2:49:58.580\n like you're saying that can resolve the prisoner dilemmas\n\n2:49:58.580 --> 2:50:01.380\n and to integrate AI to help you automate things\n\n2:50:01.380 --> 2:50:06.220\n that don't require the human ingenuity.\n\n2:50:07.460 --> 2:50:10.340\n I feel like that's where government could operate that well\n\n2:50:10.340 --> 2:50:14.620\n and can also break apart the inefficient bureaucracies\n\n2:50:14.620 --> 2:50:15.460\n if needed.\n\n2:50:15.460 --> 2:50:20.460\n There'll be a strong incentive to be efficient and successful.\n\n2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:23.020\n So out human history, we see an evolution\n\n2:50:23.020 --> 2:50:25.660\n and evolutionary competition of modes of government\n\n2:50:25.660 --> 2:50:28.180\n and of individual governments is in these modes.\n\n2:50:28.180 --> 2:50:29.900\n And every nation state in some sense\n\n2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:33.180\n is some kind of organism that has found different solutions\n\n2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:34.980\n for the problem of government.\n\n2:50:34.980 --> 2:50:37.500\n And you could look at all these different models\n\n2:50:37.500 --> 2:50:39.420\n and the different scales at which it exists\n\n2:50:39.420 --> 2:50:43.020\n as empirical attempts to validate the idea\n\n2:50:43.020 --> 2:50:45.780\n of how to build a better government.\n\n2:50:45.780 --> 2:50:49.180\n And I suspect that the idea of anarchism\n\n2:50:49.180 --> 2:50:51.900\n similar to the idea of communism\n\n2:50:51.900 --> 2:50:54.860\n is the result of being disenchanted\n\n2:50:54.860 --> 2:50:57.340\n with the ugliness of the real existing solutions\n\n2:50:57.340 --> 2:51:00.980\n and the attempt to get to an utopia.\n\n2:51:00.980 --> 2:51:04.540\n And I suspect that communism originally was not a utopia.\n\n2:51:04.540 --> 2:51:07.580\n I think that in the same way as original Christianity,\n\n2:51:07.580 --> 2:51:10.020\n it had a particular kind of vision.\n\n2:51:10.020 --> 2:51:12.540\n And this vision is a society,\n\n2:51:12.540 --> 2:51:15.300\n a mode of organization within the society\n\n2:51:15.300 --> 2:51:20.300\n in which humans can coexist at scale without coercion.\n\n2:51:20.300 --> 2:51:23.660\n In the same way as we do in a healthy family, right?\n\n2:51:23.660 --> 2:51:24.500\n In a good family,\n\n2:51:24.500 --> 2:51:28.060\n you don't terrorize each other into compliance,\n\n2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:30.300\n but you understand what everybody needs\n\n2:51:30.300 --> 2:51:32.220\n and what everybody is able to contribute\n\n2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:35.260\n and what the intended future of the whole thing is.\n\n2:51:35.260 --> 2:51:38.380\n And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way\n\n2:51:38.380 --> 2:51:40.820\n and informs each other about how to do this.\n\n2:51:40.820 --> 2:51:42.540\n And all the interactions that happen\n\n2:51:42.540 --> 2:51:45.820\n are instrumental to making that happen, right?\n\n2:51:45.820 --> 2:51:47.260\n Could this happen at scale?\n\n2:51:47.260 --> 2:51:49.180\n And I think this is the idea of communism.\n\n2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:51.420\n Communism is opposed to the idea\n\n2:51:51.420 --> 2:51:53.340\n that we need economic terror\n\n2:51:53.340 --> 2:51:55.700\n or other forms of terror to make that happen.\n\n2:51:55.700 --> 2:51:56.860\n But in practice, what happened\n\n2:51:56.860 --> 2:51:59.300\n is that the proto communist countries,\n\n2:51:59.300 --> 2:52:01.140\n the real existing socialism,\n\n2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:04.620\n replaced a part of the economic terror with moral terror,\n\n2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:05.460\n right?\n\n2:52:05.460 --> 2:52:07.540\n So we were told to do the right thing for moral reasons.\n\n2:52:07.540 --> 2:52:09.180\n And of course it didn't really work\n\n2:52:09.180 --> 2:52:11.620\n and the economy eventually collapsed.\n\n2:52:11.620 --> 2:52:14.540\n And the moral terror had actual real cost, right?\n\n2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:15.820\n People were in prison\n\n2:52:15.820 --> 2:52:17.820\n because they were morally noncompliant.\n\n2:52:17.820 --> 2:52:22.820\n And the other thing is that the idea of communism\n\n2:52:22.900 --> 2:52:24.060\n became a utopia.\n\n2:52:24.060 --> 2:52:26.140\n So it basically was projected into the afterlife.\n\n2:52:26.140 --> 2:52:28.660\n We were told in my childhood\n\n2:52:28.660 --> 2:52:31.220\n that communism was a hypothetical society\n\n2:52:31.220 --> 2:52:33.380\n to which we were in a permanent revolution\n\n2:52:33.380 --> 2:52:34.660\n that justified everything\n\n2:52:34.660 --> 2:52:37.500\n that was presently wrong with society morally.\n\n2:52:37.500 --> 2:52:39.540\n But it was something that our grandchildren\n\n2:52:39.540 --> 2:52:41.140\n probably would not ever see\n\n2:52:41.140 --> 2:52:43.860\n because it was too ideal and too far in the future\n\n2:52:43.860 --> 2:52:44.980\n to make it happen right now.\n\n2:52:44.980 --> 2:52:47.300\n And people were just not there yet morally.\n\n2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:50.300\n And the same thing happened with Christianity, right?\n\n2:52:50.300 --> 2:52:52.820\n This notion of heaven was mythologized\n\n2:52:52.820 --> 2:52:54.380\n and projected into an afterlife.\n\n2:52:54.380 --> 2:52:56.900\n And I think this was just the idea of God's kingdom\n\n2:52:56.900 --> 2:52:59.180\n of this world in which we instantiate\n\n2:52:59.180 --> 2:53:01.980\n the next level transcendental agent in the perfect form.\n\n2:53:01.980 --> 2:53:04.660\n So everything goes smoothly and without violence\n\n2:53:04.660 --> 2:53:07.980\n and without conflict and without this human messiness\n\n2:53:07.980 --> 2:53:11.340\n on this economic messiness and the terror and coercion\n\n2:53:11.340 --> 2:53:13.820\n that existed in the present societies.\n\n2:53:13.820 --> 2:53:16.980\n And the idea of that the humans can exist at some point\n\n2:53:16.980 --> 2:53:20.180\n exist at scale in a harmonious way and noncoercively\n\n2:53:20.180 --> 2:53:21.700\n is untested, right?\n\n2:53:21.700 --> 2:53:23.140\n A lot of people tested it\n\n2:53:23.140 --> 2:53:25.340\n but didn't get it to work so far.\n\n2:53:25.340 --> 2:53:27.740\n And the utopia is a world in where you get\n\n2:53:27.740 --> 2:53:30.900\n all the good things without any of the bad things.\n\n2:53:30.900 --> 2:53:34.500\n And you are, I think very susceptible to believe in utopias\n\n2:53:34.500 --> 2:53:36.860\n when you are very young and don't understand\n\n2:53:36.860 --> 2:53:39.580\n that everything has to happen in causal patterns,\n\n2:53:39.580 --> 2:53:40.940\n that there's always feedback loops\n\n2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:42.620\n that ultimately are closed.\n\n2:53:42.620 --> 2:53:44.020\n There's nothing that just happens\n\n2:53:44.020 --> 2:53:45.460\n because it's good or bad.\n\n2:53:45.460 --> 2:53:47.220\n Good or bad don't exist in isolation.\n\n2:53:47.220 --> 2:53:50.660\n They only exist with respect to larger systems.\n\n2:53:50.660 --> 2:53:55.660\n So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems?\n\n2:53:57.780 --> 2:54:01.620\n So like having a utopia that's out there beyond the horizon\n\n2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:02.900\n is it because then,\n\n2:54:04.980 --> 2:54:08.220\n it's not only because it's impossible to achieve utopias\n\n2:54:08.220 --> 2:54:11.940\n but it's because what certain humans,\n\n2:54:11.940 --> 2:54:16.940\n certain small number of humans start to sort of greedily\n\n2:54:20.220 --> 2:54:25.220\n attain power and money and control and influence\n\n2:54:25.540 --> 2:54:27.260\n as they become,\n\n2:54:28.980 --> 2:54:33.980\n as they see the power in using this idea of a utopia\n\n2:54:34.420 --> 2:54:35.260\n for propaganda.\n\n2:54:35.260 --> 2:54:37.260\n It's a bit like saying, why is my garden not perfect?\n\n2:54:37.260 --> 2:54:39.780\n It's because some evil weeds are overgrowing it\n\n2:54:39.780 --> 2:54:41.540\n and they always do, right?\n\n2:54:41.540 --> 2:54:43.220\n But this is not how it works.\n\n2:54:43.220 --> 2:54:45.420\n A good garden is a system that is in balance\n\n2:54:45.420 --> 2:54:48.620\n and requires minimal interactions by the gardener.\n\n2:54:48.620 --> 2:54:51.860\n And so you need to create a system\n\n2:54:51.860 --> 2:54:54.220\n that is designed to self stabilize.\n\n2:54:54.220 --> 2:54:55.860\n And the design of social systems\n\n2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:57.500\n requires not just the implementation\n\n2:54:57.500 --> 2:54:58.780\n of the desired functionality,\n\n2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:01.820\n but the next level design, also in biological systems.\n\n2:55:01.820 --> 2:55:04.140\n You need to create a system that wants to converge\n\n2:55:04.140 --> 2:55:06.100\n to the intended function.\n\n2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:09.380\n And so instead of just creating an institution like the FDA\n\n2:55:09.380 --> 2:55:13.180\n that is performing a particular kind of role in society,\n\n2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:15.780\n you need to make sure that the FDA is actually driven\n\n2:55:15.780 --> 2:55:18.180\n by a system that wants to do this optimally,\n\n2:55:18.180 --> 2:55:19.860\n that is incentivized to do it optimally\n\n2:55:19.860 --> 2:55:23.340\n and then makes the performance that is actually enacted\n\n2:55:23.340 --> 2:55:26.220\n in every generation instrumental to that thing,\n\n2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:27.660\n that actual goal, right?\n\n2:55:27.660 --> 2:55:30.100\n And that is much harder to design and to achieve.\n\n2:55:30.100 --> 2:55:32.460\n See if the design a system where,\n\n2:55:32.460 --> 2:55:36.940\n and listen communism also was quote unquote incentivized\n\n2:55:36.940 --> 2:55:41.940\n to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia.\n\n2:55:43.500 --> 2:55:45.820\n It's just, it wasn't working given human nature.\n\n2:55:45.820 --> 2:55:47.980\n The incentives were not correct given human nature.\n\n2:55:47.980 --> 2:55:50.460\n How do you incentivize people\n\n2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:52.340\n when they are getting coal off the ground\n\n2:55:52.340 --> 2:55:53.900\n to work as hard as possible?\n\n2:55:53.900 --> 2:55:55.540\n Because it's a terrible job\n\n2:55:55.540 --> 2:55:57.060\n and it's very bad for your health.\n\n2:55:57.060 --> 2:55:59.540\n And right, how do you do this?\n\n2:55:59.540 --> 2:56:03.620\n And you can give them prices and medals and status\n\n2:56:03.620 --> 2:56:04.580\n to some degree, right?\n\n2:56:04.580 --> 2:56:06.900\n There's only so much status to give for that.\n\n2:56:06.900 --> 2:56:09.340\n And most people will not fall for this, right?\n\n2:56:09.340 --> 2:56:12.940\n Or you can pay them and you probably have to pay them\n\n2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:15.700\n in an asymmetric way because if you pay everybody the same\n\n2:56:15.700 --> 2:56:19.100\n and you nationalize the coal mines,\n\n2:56:19.100 --> 2:56:20.620\n eventually people will figure out\n\n2:56:20.620 --> 2:56:21.940\n that they can game the system.\n\n2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:25.820\n Yes, so you're describing capitalism.\n\n2:56:25.820 --> 2:56:28.620\n So capitalism is the present solution to the system.\n\n2:56:28.620 --> 2:56:32.140\n And what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct\n\n2:56:32.140 --> 2:56:35.140\n in saying that capitalism is prone to crisis,\n\n2:56:35.140 --> 2:56:38.460\n that capitalism is a system that in its dynamics\n\n2:56:38.460 --> 2:56:40.780\n is not convergent, but divergent.\n\n2:56:40.780 --> 2:56:42.860\n It's not a stable system.\n\n2:56:42.860 --> 2:56:47.380\n And that eventually it produces an enormous potential\n\n2:56:47.380 --> 2:56:50.820\n for productivity, but it also is systematically\n\n2:56:50.820 --> 2:56:52.140\n misallocating resources.\n\n2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:54.700\n So a lot of people cannot participate\n\n2:56:54.700 --> 2:56:57.300\n in the production and consumption anymore, right?\n\n2:56:57.300 --> 2:56:58.420\n And this is what we observed.\n\n2:56:58.420 --> 2:57:01.460\n We observed that the middle class in the US is tiny.\n\n2:57:01.460 --> 2:57:05.500\n It's a lot of people think that they're middle class,\n\n2:57:05.500 --> 2:57:07.460\n but if you are still flying economy,\n\n2:57:07.460 --> 2:57:11.660\n you're not middle class, right?\n\n2:57:11.660 --> 2:57:14.700\n Every class is a magnitude smaller than the previous class.\n\n2:57:14.700 --> 2:57:23.060\n And I think about classes is really like airline class.\n\n2:57:23.060 --> 2:57:25.700\n I like class.\n\n2:57:25.700 --> 2:57:28.580\n A lot of people are economy class, business class,\n\n2:57:28.580 --> 2:57:30.900\n and very few are first class and some are budget.\n\n2:57:30.900 --> 2:57:32.860\n I mean, some, I understand.\n\n2:57:32.860 --> 2:57:36.940\n I think there's, yeah, maybe some people,\n\n2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:38.140\n probably I would push back\n\n2:57:38.140 --> 2:57:39.660\n against that definition of the middle class.\n\n2:57:39.660 --> 2:57:41.460\n It does feel like the middle class is pretty large,\n\n2:57:41.460 --> 2:57:44.460\n but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth.\n\n2:57:45.740 --> 2:57:48.620\n So if you think about in terms of the productivity\n\n2:57:48.620 --> 2:57:50.900\n that our society could have,\n\n2:57:50.900 --> 2:57:53.980\n there is no reason for anybody to fly economy, right?\n\n2:57:53.980 --> 2:57:57.940\n We would be able to let everybody travel in style.\n\n2:57:57.940 --> 2:58:00.220\n Well, but also some people like to be frugal\n\n2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:01.620\n even when they're billionaires, okay?\n\n2:58:01.620 --> 2:58:04.580\n So like that, let's take that into account.\n\n2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:07.260\n I mean, we probably don't need to be a traveling lavish,\n\n2:58:07.260 --> 2:58:09.780\n but you also don't need to be tortured, right?\n\n2:58:09.780 --> 2:58:11.820\n There is a difference between frugal\n\n2:58:11.820 --> 2:58:14.140\n and subjecting yourself to torture.\n\n2:58:14.140 --> 2:58:15.220\n Listen, I love economy.\n\n2:58:15.220 --> 2:58:16.780\n I don't understand why you're comparing\n\n2:58:16.780 --> 2:58:19.420\n a fly economy to torture.\n\n2:58:19.420 --> 2:58:22.500\n I don't, although the fight here,\n\n2:58:22.500 --> 2:58:24.380\n there's two crying babies next to me.\n\n2:58:24.380 --> 2:58:26.460\n So that, but that has nothing to do with economy.\n\n2:58:26.460 --> 2:58:28.540\n It has to do with crying babies.\n\n2:58:28.540 --> 2:58:29.380\n They're very cute though.\n\n2:58:29.380 --> 2:58:30.220\n So they kind of.\n\n2:58:30.220 --> 2:58:31.260\n Yeah, I have two kids\n\n2:58:31.260 --> 2:58:35.020\n and sometimes I have to go back to visit the grandparents.\n\n2:58:35.020 --> 2:58:40.020\n And that means going from the west coast to Germany\n\n2:58:41.300 --> 2:58:42.700\n and that's a long flight.\n\n2:58:42.700 --> 2:58:45.300\n Is it true that, so when you're a father,\n\n2:58:45.300 --> 2:58:48.540\n you grow immune to the crying and all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:58:48.540 --> 2:58:52.260\n like the, because like me just not having kids,\n\n2:58:52.260 --> 2:58:54.620\n it can be other people's kids can be quite annoying\n\n2:58:54.620 --> 2:58:55.820\n when they're crying and screaming\n\n2:58:55.820 --> 2:58:57.220\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:58:57.220 --> 2:58:59.540\n When you have children and you are wired up\n\n2:58:59.540 --> 2:59:01.460\n in the default natural way,\n\n2:59:01.460 --> 2:59:04.340\n you're lucky in this regard, you fall in love with them.\n\n2:59:04.340 --> 2:59:06.980\n And this falling in love with them means\n\n2:59:06.980 --> 2:59:10.180\n that you basically start to see the world through their eyes\n\n2:59:10.180 --> 2:59:12.500\n and you understand that in a given situation,\n\n2:59:12.500 --> 2:59:17.500\n they cannot do anything but being expressing despair.\n\n2:59:17.740 --> 2:59:19.700\n And so it becomes more differentiated.\n\n2:59:19.700 --> 2:59:21.020\n I noticed that for instance,\n\n2:59:21.020 --> 2:59:25.940\n my son is typically acting on a pure experience\n\n2:59:25.940 --> 2:59:28.540\n of what things are like right now\n\n2:59:28.540 --> 2:59:30.380\n and he has to do this right now.\n\n2:59:30.380 --> 2:59:32.540\n And you have this small child that is,\n\n2:59:33.740 --> 2:59:35.020\n when he was a baby and so on,\n\n2:59:35.020 --> 2:59:37.580\n where he was just immediately expressing what he felt.\n\n2:59:37.580 --> 2:59:39.940\n And if you cannot regulate this from the outside,\n\n2:59:39.940 --> 2:59:42.260\n there's no point to be upset about it, right?\n\n2:59:42.260 --> 2:59:45.060\n It's like dealing with weather or something like this.\n\n2:59:45.060 --> 2:59:46.620\n You all have to get through it\n\n2:59:46.620 --> 2:59:48.620\n and it's not easy for him either.\n\n2:59:48.620 --> 2:59:51.820\n But if you also have a daughter,\n\n2:59:51.820 --> 2:59:53.300\n maybe she is planning for that.\n\n2:59:53.300 --> 2:59:57.420\n Maybe she understands that she's sitting in the car\n\n2:59:57.420 --> 2:59:59.860\n behind you and she's screaming at the top of her lungs\n\n2:59:59.860 --> 3:00:01.820\n and you're almost doing an accident\n\n3:00:01.820 --> 3:00:03.740\n and you really don't know what to do.\n\n3:00:03.740 --> 3:00:06.380\n What should I have done to make you stop screaming?\n\n3:00:06.380 --> 3:00:07.900\n You could have given me candy.\n\n3:00:10.020 --> 3:00:12.140\n I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion.\n\n3:00:12.140 --> 3:00:12.980\n I love it.\n\n3:00:13.940 --> 3:00:18.940\n Cause you said like a fundamental aspect of that is love\n\n3:00:19.420 --> 3:00:21.220\n that makes it all worth it.\n\n3:00:21.220 --> 3:00:26.220\n What, in this monkey riding an elephant in a dream world,\n\n3:00:26.740 --> 3:00:30.260\n what role does love play in the human condition?\n\n3:00:31.540 --> 3:00:33.540\n I think that love is the facilitator\n\n3:00:33.540 --> 3:00:35.500\n of non transactional interaction.\n\n3:00:37.140 --> 3:00:40.140\n And you are observing your own purposes.\n\n3:00:40.140 --> 3:00:42.460\n Some of these purposes go beyond your ego.\n\n3:00:42.460 --> 3:00:45.140\n They go beyond the particular organism\n\n3:00:45.140 --> 3:00:46.780\n that you are and your local interests.\n\n3:00:46.780 --> 3:00:48.540\n That's what you mean by non transactional.\n\n3:00:48.540 --> 3:00:50.180\n Yes, so basically when you are acting\n\n3:00:50.180 --> 3:00:52.860\n in a transactional way, it means that you are respecting\n\n3:00:52.860 --> 3:00:54.180\n something in return for you\n\n3:00:55.420 --> 3:00:58.060\n from the one that you're interacting with.\n\n3:00:58.060 --> 3:00:59.860\n You are interacting with a random stranger,\n\n3:00:59.860 --> 3:01:01.340\n you buy something from them on eBay,\n\n3:01:01.340 --> 3:01:03.900\n you expect a fair value for the money that you sent them\n\n3:01:03.900 --> 3:01:05.420\n and vice versa.\n\n3:01:05.420 --> 3:01:06.580\n Because you don't know that person,\n\n3:01:06.580 --> 3:01:09.020\n you don't have any kind of relationship to them.\n\n3:01:09.020 --> 3:01:10.660\n But when you know this person a little bit better\n\n3:01:10.660 --> 3:01:12.740\n and you know the situation that they're in,\n\n3:01:12.740 --> 3:01:14.940\n you understand what they try to achieve in their life\n\n3:01:14.940 --> 3:01:17.700\n and you approve because you realize that they're\n\n3:01:17.700 --> 3:01:22.420\n in some sense serving the same human sacredness as you are.\n\n3:01:22.420 --> 3:01:23.820\n And they need to think that you have,\n\n3:01:23.820 --> 3:01:25.660\n maybe you give it to them as a present.\n\n3:01:26.700 --> 3:01:31.700\n But, I mean, the feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit,\n\n3:01:32.180 --> 3:01:34.660\n is a kind of transaction, like...\n\n3:01:34.660 --> 3:01:36.500\n Yes, but the joy is not the point.\n\n3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:38.460\n The joy is the signal that you get.\n\n3:01:38.460 --> 3:01:40.900\n It's the reinforcement signal that your brain sends to you\n\n3:01:40.900 --> 3:01:43.740\n because you are acting on the incentives\n\n3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:45.740\n of the agent that you're a part of.\n\n3:01:45.740 --> 3:01:48.500\n We are meant to be part of something larger.\n\n3:01:48.500 --> 3:01:51.340\n This is the way in which we out competed other hominins.\n\n3:01:54.100 --> 3:01:56.420\n Take that Neanderthals.\n\n3:01:56.420 --> 3:01:57.420\n Yeah, right.\n\n3:01:57.420 --> 3:01:59.620\n And also other humans.\n\n3:01:59.620 --> 3:02:03.100\n There was a population bottleneck for human society\n\n3:02:03.100 --> 3:02:06.900\n that leads to an extreme lack of genetic diversity\n\n3:02:06.900 --> 3:02:07.740\n among humans.\n\n3:02:07.740 --> 3:02:11.300\n If you look at Bushmen in the Kalahari,\n\n3:02:11.300 --> 3:02:13.900\n that basically tribes that are not that far distant\n\n3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:15.860\n to each other have more genetic diversity\n\n3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:18.860\n than exists between Europeans and Chinese.\n\n3:02:19.740 --> 3:02:23.460\n And that's because basically the out of Africa population\n\n3:02:23.460 --> 3:02:25.060\n at some point had a bottleneck\n\n3:02:25.060 --> 3:02:27.740\n of just a few thousand individuals.\n\n3:02:27.740 --> 3:02:30.980\n And what probably happened is not that at any time\n\n3:02:30.980 --> 3:02:34.740\n the number of people shrank below a few hundred thousand.\n\n3:02:34.740 --> 3:02:37.580\n What probably happened is that there was a small group\n\n3:02:37.580 --> 3:02:40.460\n that had a decisive mutation that produced an advantage.\n\n3:02:40.460 --> 3:02:44.100\n And this group multiplied and killed everybody else.\n\n3:02:44.100 --> 3:02:46.140\n And we are descendants of that group.\n\n3:02:46.140 --> 3:02:50.780\n Yeah, I wonder what the peculiar characteristics\n\n3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:52.140\n of that group.\n\n3:02:52.140 --> 3:02:53.100\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:53.100 --> 3:02:53.940\n I mean, we can never know.\n\n3:02:53.940 --> 3:02:55.460\n Me too, and a lot of people do.\n\n3:02:55.460 --> 3:02:58.220\n We can only just listen to the echoes in ours,\n\n3:02:58.220 --> 3:03:01.660\n like the ripples that are still within us.\n\n3:03:01.660 --> 3:03:04.420\n So I suspect what eventually made a big difference\n\n3:03:04.420 --> 3:03:07.580\n was the ability to organize at scale,\n\n3:03:07.580 --> 3:03:09.260\n to program each other.\n\n3:03:09.260 --> 3:03:11.380\n With ideas.\n\n3:03:11.380 --> 3:03:12.620\n That we became programmable,\n\n3:03:12.620 --> 3:03:14.500\n that we were willing to work in lockstep,\n\n3:03:14.500 --> 3:03:17.420\n that we went above the tribal level,\n\n3:03:17.420 --> 3:03:20.700\n that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals\n\n3:03:20.700 --> 3:03:24.460\n and acted on direct reputation systems transactionally,\n\n3:03:24.460 --> 3:03:27.420\n but that we basically evolved an adaptation\n\n3:03:27.420 --> 3:03:28.980\n to become state building.\n\n3:03:28.980 --> 3:03:29.820\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:31.740 --> 3:03:35.700\n To form collectives outside of the direct collectives.\n\n3:03:35.700 --> 3:03:38.580\n Yes, and that's basically a part of us became committed\n\n3:03:38.580 --> 3:03:41.940\n to serving something outside of what we know.\n\n3:03:41.940 --> 3:03:44.140\n Yeah, then that's kind of what love is.\n\n3:03:44.140 --> 3:03:45.820\n And it's terrifying because it meant\n\n3:03:45.820 --> 3:03:47.420\n that we eradicated the others.\n\n3:03:48.900 --> 3:03:49.820\n Right, it's a force.\n\n3:03:49.820 --> 3:03:52.940\n It's an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution,\n\n3:03:52.940 --> 3:03:54.540\n which means we displace something else\n\n3:03:54.540 --> 3:03:55.700\n that doesn't have that.\n\n3:03:56.780 --> 3:03:58.740\n Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people\n\n3:03:58.740 --> 3:04:00.380\n that weren't about love.\n\n3:04:00.380 --> 3:04:01.660\n So love led to destruction.\n\n3:04:01.660 --> 3:04:04.020\n They didn't have the same strong love as we did.\n\n3:04:04.020 --> 3:04:07.420\n Right, that's why I mentioned this thing with fascism.\n\n3:04:07.420 --> 3:04:12.220\n When you see these speeches, do you want total war?\n\n3:04:12.220 --> 3:04:14.180\n And everybody says, yes, right?\n\n3:04:14.180 --> 3:04:17.620\n This is this big, oh my God, we are part of something\n\n3:04:17.620 --> 3:04:18.660\n that is more important than me\n\n3:04:18.660 --> 3:04:20.380\n that gives meaning to my existence.\n\n3:04:22.980 --> 3:04:23.820\n Fair enough.\n\n3:04:27.020 --> 3:04:30.980\n Do you have advice for young people today\n\n3:04:30.980 --> 3:04:33.140\n in high school, in college,\n\n3:04:33.140 --> 3:04:37.260\n that are thinking about what to do with their career,\n\n3:04:37.260 --> 3:04:40.420\n with their life, so that at the end of the whole thing,\n\n3:04:40.420 --> 3:04:42.180\n they can be proud of what they did?\n\n3:04:43.820 --> 3:04:44.660\n Don't cheat.\n\n3:04:45.860 --> 3:04:48.540\n Have integrity, aim for integrity.\n\n3:04:48.540 --> 3:04:50.860\n So what does integrity look like when you're at the river\n\n3:04:50.860 --> 3:04:53.460\n or the leaf or the fat frog in a lake?\n\n3:04:54.580 --> 3:04:57.700\n It basically means that you try to figure out\n\n3:04:57.700 --> 3:05:02.060\n what the thing is that is the most right.\n\n3:05:02.060 --> 3:05:04.620\n And this doesn't mean that you have to look\n\n3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:07.140\n for what other people tell you what's right,\n\n3:05:07.140 --> 3:05:09.740\n but you have to aim for moral autonomy.\n\n3:05:09.740 --> 3:05:12.220\n So things need to be right independently\n\n3:05:12.220 --> 3:05:14.100\n of what other people say.\n\n3:05:14.100 --> 3:05:17.620\n I always felt that when people told me\n\n3:05:17.620 --> 3:05:22.620\n to listen to what others say, like read the room,\n\n3:05:22.940 --> 3:05:25.060\n build your ideas of what's true\n\n3:05:25.060 --> 3:05:27.020\n based on the high status people of your in group,\n\n3:05:27.020 --> 3:05:29.780\n that does not protect me from fascism.\n\n3:05:29.780 --> 3:05:31.940\n The only way to protect yourself from fascism\n\n3:05:31.940 --> 3:05:35.580\n is to decide it's the world that is being built here,\n\n3:05:35.580 --> 3:05:37.620\n the world that I want to be in.\n\n3:05:37.620 --> 3:05:41.740\n And so in some sense, try to make your behavior sustainable,\n\n3:05:41.740 --> 3:05:44.540\n act in such a way that you would feel comfortable\n\n3:05:44.540 --> 3:05:46.420\n on all sides of the transaction.\n\n3:05:46.420 --> 3:05:48.900\n Realize that everybody is you in a different timeline,\n\n3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:51.140\n but is seeing things differently\n\n3:05:51.140 --> 3:05:52.620\n and has reasons to do so.\n\n3:05:53.940 --> 3:05:58.100\n Yeah, I've come to realize this recently,\n\n3:05:58.100 --> 3:05:59.340\n that there is an inner voice\n\n3:05:59.340 --> 3:06:02.820\n that tells you what's right and wrong.\n\n3:06:02.820 --> 3:06:06.180\n And speaking of reading the room,\n\n3:06:06.180 --> 3:06:08.060\n there's times what integrity looks like\n\n3:06:08.060 --> 3:06:10.460\n is there's times when a lot of people\n\n3:06:10.460 --> 3:06:12.180\n are doing something wrong.\n\n3:06:12.180 --> 3:06:13.740\n And what integrity looks like\n\n3:06:13.740 --> 3:06:16.500\n is not going on Twitter and tweeting about it,\n\n3:06:16.500 --> 3:06:20.260\n but not participating quietly, not doing.\n\n3:06:20.260 --> 3:06:24.100\n So it's not like signaling or not all this kind of stuff,\n\n3:06:24.100 --> 3:06:28.020\n but actually living your, what you think is right.\n\n3:06:28.020 --> 3:06:28.860\n Like living it, not signaling.\n\n3:06:28.860 --> 3:06:30.980\n There's also sometimes this expectation\n\n3:06:30.980 --> 3:06:32.260\n that others are like us.\n\n3:06:32.260 --> 3:06:34.380\n So imagine the possibility\n\n3:06:34.380 --> 3:06:37.060\n that some of the people around you are space aliens\n\n3:06:37.060 --> 3:06:39.500\n that only look human, right?\n\n3:06:39.500 --> 3:06:41.620\n So they don't have the same prayers as you do.\n\n3:06:41.620 --> 3:06:44.100\n They don't have the same impulses\n\n3:06:44.100 --> 3:06:45.180\n that's what's right and wrong.\n\n3:06:45.180 --> 3:06:48.900\n There's a large diversity in these basic impulses\n\n3:06:48.900 --> 3:06:51.820\n that people can have in a given situation.\n\n3:06:51.820 --> 3:06:54.660\n And now realize that you are a space alien, right?\n\n3:06:54.660 --> 3:06:55.900\n You are not actually human.\n\n3:06:55.900 --> 3:06:57.220\n You think that you are human,\n\n3:06:57.220 --> 3:06:58.820\n but you don't know what it means,\n\n3:06:58.820 --> 3:07:00.780\n like what it's like to be human.\n\n3:07:00.780 --> 3:07:04.020\n You just make it up as you go along like everybody else.\n\n3:07:04.020 --> 3:07:05.740\n And you have to figure that out,\n\n3:07:05.740 --> 3:07:09.620\n what it means that you are a full human being,\n\n3:07:09.620 --> 3:07:11.180\n what it means to be human in the world\n\n3:07:11.180 --> 3:07:13.540\n and how to connect with others on that.\n\n3:07:13.540 --> 3:07:17.340\n And there is also something, don't be afraid\n\n3:07:17.340 --> 3:07:20.980\n in the sense that if you do this, you're not good enough.\n\n3:07:20.980 --> 3:07:23.580\n Because if you are acting on these incentives of integrity,\n\n3:07:23.580 --> 3:07:25.140\n you become trustworthy.\n\n3:07:25.140 --> 3:07:28.420\n That's the way in which you can recognize each other.\n\n3:07:28.420 --> 3:07:30.700\n There is a particular place where you can meet.\n\n3:07:30.700 --> 3:07:33.060\n You can figure out what that place is,\n\n3:07:33.060 --> 3:07:35.420\n where you will give support to people\n\n3:07:35.420 --> 3:07:38.420\n because you realize that they act with integrity\n\n3:07:38.420 --> 3:07:40.300\n and they will also do that.\n\n3:07:40.300 --> 3:07:42.580\n So in some sense, you are safe if you do that.\n\n3:07:43.860 --> 3:07:44.940\n You're not always protected.\n\n3:07:44.940 --> 3:07:47.100\n There are people which will abuse you\n\n3:07:47.100 --> 3:07:49.940\n and that are bad actors in a way\n\n3:07:49.940 --> 3:07:52.780\n that it's hard to imagine before you meet them.\n\n3:07:52.780 --> 3:07:57.780\n But there is also people which will try to protect you.\n\n3:07:57.780 --> 3:08:00.820\n Yeah, that's such a, thank you for saying that.\n\n3:08:00.820 --> 3:08:03.820\n That's such a hopeful message\n\n3:08:03.820 --> 3:08:05.380\n that no matter what happens to you,\n\n3:08:05.380 --> 3:08:10.100\n there'll be a place, there's people you'll meet\n\n3:08:11.740 --> 3:08:15.620\n that also have what you have\n\n3:08:15.620 --> 3:08:20.180\n and you will find happiness there and safety there.\n\n3:08:20.180 --> 3:08:21.700\n Yeah, but it doesn't need to end well.\n\n3:08:21.700 --> 3:08:23.500\n It can also all go wrong.\n\n3:08:23.500 --> 3:08:26.380\n So there's no guarantees in this life.\n\n3:08:26.380 --> 3:08:29.380\n So you can do everything right and you still can fail\n\n3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:32.500\n and you can see horrible things happening to you\n\n3:08:32.500 --> 3:08:35.060\n that traumatize you and mutilate you\n\n3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:37.580\n and you have to be grateful if it doesn't happen.\n\n3:08:40.300 --> 3:08:42.940\n And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens\n\n3:08:42.940 --> 3:08:45.620\n because even just being alive is pretty damn nice.\n\n3:08:46.860 --> 3:08:48.220\n Yeah, even that, you know.\n\n3:08:49.580 --> 3:08:52.260\n The gratefulness in some sense is also just generated\n\n3:08:52.260 --> 3:08:57.260\n by your brain to keep you going, it's all the trick.\n\n3:08:58.900 --> 3:09:01.980\n Speaking of which, Camus said,\n\n3:09:02.900 --> 3:09:05.540\n I see many people die because they judge\n\n3:09:05.540 --> 3:09:08.020\n that life is not worth living.\n\n3:09:08.020 --> 3:09:10.820\n I see others paradoxically getting killed\n\n3:09:10.820 --> 3:09:12.860\n for the ideas or illusions that give them\n\n3:09:12.860 --> 3:09:15.020\n a reason for living.\n\n3:09:15.020 --> 3:09:16.420\n What is called the reason for living\n\n3:09:16.420 --> 3:09:18.460\n is also an excellent reason for dying.\n\n3:09:19.420 --> 3:09:22.020\n I therefore conclude that the meaning of life\n\n3:09:22.020 --> 3:09:24.660\n is the most urgent of questions.\n\n3:09:24.660 --> 3:09:29.660\n So I have to ask what Jascha Bach is the meaning of life?\n\n3:09:31.500 --> 3:09:33.860\n It is an urgent question according to Camus.\n\n3:09:35.260 --> 3:09:37.940\n I don't think that there's a single answer to this.\n\n3:09:37.940 --> 3:09:41.340\n Nothing makes sense unless the mind makes it so.\n\n3:09:41.340 --> 3:09:44.820\n So you basically have to project a purpose.\n\n3:09:44.820 --> 3:09:47.380\n And if you zoom out far enough,\n\n3:09:47.380 --> 3:09:49.060\n there's the heat test of the universe\n\n3:09:49.060 --> 3:09:50.500\n and everything is meaningless,\n\n3:09:50.500 --> 3:09:52.100\n everything is just a blip in between.\n\n3:09:52.100 --> 3:09:54.020\n And the question is, do you find meaning\n\n3:09:54.020 --> 3:09:55.820\n in this blip in between?\n\n3:09:55.820 --> 3:09:59.780\n Do you find meaning in observing squirrels?\n\n3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:01.740\n Do you find meaning in raising children\n\n3:10:01.740 --> 3:10:04.420\n and projecting a multi generational organism\n\n3:10:04.420 --> 3:10:05.660\n into the future?\n\n3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:08.260\n Do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic\n\n3:10:08.260 --> 3:10:10.620\n of the world that you like to the future\n\n3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:12.340\n and trying to serve that aesthetic?\n\n3:10:12.340 --> 3:10:15.300\n And if you do, then life has that meaning.\n\n3:10:15.300 --> 3:10:17.140\n And if you don't, then it doesn't.\n\n3:10:17.140 --> 3:10:21.780\n I kind of enjoy the idea that you just create\n\n3:10:21.780 --> 3:10:25.660\n the most vibrant, the most weird,\n\n3:10:25.660 --> 3:10:28.740\n the most unique kind of blip you can,\n\n3:10:28.740 --> 3:10:32.020\n given your environment, given your set of skills,\n\n3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:37.020\n just be the most weird set of,\n\n3:10:38.740 --> 3:10:41.740\n like local pocket of complexity you can be.\n\n3:10:41.740 --> 3:10:44.500\n So that like, when people study the universe,\n\n3:10:44.500 --> 3:10:47.340\n they'll pause and be like, oh, that's weird.\n\n3:10:47.340 --> 3:10:50.580\n It looks like a useful strategy,\n\n3:10:50.580 --> 3:10:52.780\n but of course it's still motivated reasoning.\n\n3:10:52.780 --> 3:10:57.780\n You're obviously acting on your incentives here.\n\n3:10:57.780 --> 3:11:00.700\n It's still a story we tell ourselves within a dream\n\n3:11:00.700 --> 3:11:03.860\n that's hardly in touch with the reality.\n\n3:11:03.860 --> 3:11:06.460\n It's definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.\n\n3:11:10.180 --> 3:11:13.060\n And a human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am.\n\n3:11:13.060 --> 3:11:15.020\n It has a mutual relationship somehow.\n\n3:11:15.020 --> 3:11:16.060\n Somehow.\n\n3:11:16.060 --> 3:11:20.860\n Josh, you're one of the most incredible people I know.\n\n3:11:20.860 --> 3:11:22.380\n I really love talking to you.\n\n3:11:22.380 --> 3:11:23.500\n I love talking to you again,\n\n3:11:23.500 --> 3:11:26.060\n and it's really an honor that you spend\n\n3:11:26.060 --> 3:11:27.100\n your valuable time with me.\n\n3:11:27.100 --> 3:11:28.580\n I hope we get to talk many times\n\n3:11:28.580 --> 3:11:33.580\n through our short and meaningless lives.\n\n3:11:33.580 --> 3:11:34.620\n Or meaningful.\n\n3:11:34.620 --> 3:11:35.900\n Or meaningful.\n\n3:11:35.900 --> 3:11:36.740\n Thank you, Alex.\n\n3:11:36.740 --> 3:11:39.020\n I enjoyed this conversation very much.\n\n3:11:39.020 --> 3:11:41.700\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Josche Bach.\n\n3:11:41.700 --> 3:11:45.900\n A thank you to Coinbase, Codecademy, Linode,\n\n3:11:45.900 --> 3:11:48.500\n NetSuite, and ExpressVPN.\n\n3:11:48.500 --> 3:11:52.020\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n3:11:52.020 --> 3:11:54.900\n Now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.\n\n3:11:55.780 --> 3:11:59.020\n People will do anything, no matter how absurd,\n\n3:11:59.020 --> 3:12:01.780\n in order to avoid facing their own souls.\n\n3:12:01.780 --> 3:12:03.580\n One does not become enlightened\n\n3:12:03.580 --> 3:12:05.780\n by imagining figures of light,\n\n3:12:05.780 --> 3:12:09.260\n but by making the darkness conscious.\n\n3:12:09.260 --> 3:12:12.500\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
