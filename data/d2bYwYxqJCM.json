--> 00:08.920\n How to Invest in Technology Startups,\n\n00:08.920 --> 00:13.400\n and as many people may know, he's a fun, brilliant,\n\n00:13.400 --> 00:17.520\n long time podcast host of This Week in Startups,\n\n00:17.520 --> 00:20.960\n and co host of the All In podcast\n\n00:20.960 --> 00:25.640\n with Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sachs, and David Friedberg,\n\n00:25.640 --> 00:28.040\n who all happen to be poker buddies\n\n00:28.040 --> 00:30.320\n and self proclaimed besties.\n\n00:30.320 --> 00:32.880\n The result is always a great listen\n\n00:32.880 --> 00:37.080\n due to both the love and the heated disagreements.\n\n00:37.080 --> 00:38.840\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:38.840 --> 00:42.720\n Brave Browser, Linode Linux Virtual Machines,\n\n00:42.720 --> 00:44.760\n

--> 00:58.960\n To give you a bit of context on the side,\n\n00:58.960 --> 01:02.360\n I've studied trading from an algorithmic trading perspective\n\n01:02.360 --> 01:04.960\n as a machine learning and a game theory problem\n\n01:04.960 --> 01:08.320\n off and on for a few years in undergrad and grad school.\n\n01:08.320 --> 01:12.040\n I found the distributed complex system aspect of finance\n\n01:12.040 --> 01:14.480\n and economics in general fascinating,\n\n01:14.480 --> 01:17.040\n but now I find even more fascinating\n\n01:17.040 --> 01:19.040\n the human side of the whole thing,\n\n01:19.040 --> 01:23.440\n ideas of greed, power, freedom, and truth.\n\n01:23.440 --> 01:26.840\n Wall Street bets, Robin Hood, and the whole beautiful mess\n\n01:26.840 --> 01:30.400\n around this topic allows us to have great conversations\n\n01:30.400 --> 01:33.800\n about human nature and the systems that underlie\n\n01:33.800 --> 01:36.800\n the rise and fall of civilizations.\n\n01:36.800 --> 01:39.280\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:39.280 --> 01:42.400\n review it on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,\n\n01:42.400 --> 01:45.200\n

01:53.540\n I have a million things to talk to you about,\n\n01:53.540 --> 01:57.100\n but we do happen to be living through\n\n01:57.100 --> 02:00.460\n what I would think of as a historic event\n\n02:00.460 --> 02:04.540\n in terms of its impact, in terms of almost philosophically\n\n02:04.540 --> 02:07.220\n thinking about the role of people\n\n02:07.220 --> 02:09.540\n and how they can fight power\n\n02:09.540 --> 02:13.500\n with this whole Wall Street bets and GameStop situation.\n\n02:13.500 --> 02:17.220\n I was wondering, you've covered in your amazing\n\n02:17.220 --> 02:19.260\n all in podcast, you guys have been having\n\n02:19.260 --> 02:22.460\n fascinating battles over this whole situation.\n\n02:22.460 --> 02:23.980\n I was wondering if you could tell maybe\n\n02:23.980 --> 02:27.780\n from your perspective, as it's unrolling\n\n02:27.780 --> 02:30.300\n the saga of Wall Street bets and GameStop,\n\n02:30.300 --> 02:33.020\n what are some interesting insights\n\n02:33.020 --> 02:36.780\n that you have about this whole set of events?\n\n02:36.780 --> 02:38.860\n In full disclosure, I was an angel investor\n\n02:38.860 --> 02:40.980\n in Robin Hood before they launched.\n\n02:40.980 --> 02:44.760\n And when I met the founder, Vlad, and his partner,\n\n02:44.760 --> 02:46.900\n you know, they pitched me at a bar,\n\n02:46.900 --> 02:48.940\n not too far from where we are right now in Palo Alto,\n\n02:48.940 --> 02:51.060\n called Antonio's Nut House.\n\n02:51.060 --> 02:54.580\n And my friend Adeo, it's a really good story,\n\n02:54.580 --> 02:56.100\n my friend Adeo had asked me to speak\n\n02:56.100 --> 02:57.620\n at his founder's institute, which is kind of like\n\n02:57.620 --> 02:59.860\n an accelerator for people who were thinking\n\n02:59.860 --> 03:01.420\n about starting a company.\n\n03:01.420 --> 03:02.940\n And so I gave a talk, and then he said,\n\n03:02.940 --> 03:04.380\n hey, let's go to Antonio's Nut House\n\n03:04.380 --> 03:07.380\n and we'll meet Elon for a drink.\n\n03:07.380 --> 03:09.620\n And so Elon met us for a drink there.\n\n03:09.620 --> 03:12.020\n And it's the divest of dive bars.\n\n03:12.020 --> 03:14.540\n Like you'll take a beer and it will...\n\n03:14.540 --> 03:15.580\n I love the image of all of this.\n\n03:15.580 --> 03:18.700\n You hang out with Elon at a crappy bar.\n\n03:18.700 --> 03:23.700\n Yeah, I mean, it is the worst bar in the peninsula.\n\n03:23.900 --> 03:27.340\n Like just garbage on the floor, and like cheap beer,\n\n03:27.340 --> 03:29.780\n and warm beer, and like you'll pick up your pint glass\n\n03:29.780 --> 03:30.820\n and be lipstick on it.\n\n03:30.820 --> 03:31.820\n It's brutal.\n\n03:31.820 --> 03:32.660\n Classy.\n\n03:32.660 --> 03:33.540\n Not your lipstick.\n\n03:33.540 --> 03:35.740\n You understand, somebody else's lipstick.\n\n03:35.740 --> 03:39.780\n And so we're sitting there and Vlad walks up\n\n03:39.780 --> 03:43.380\n with his partner and he says, you're Jason Calacanis.\n\n03:43.380 --> 03:44.820\n And I said, tell me about your startup.\n\n03:44.820 --> 03:46.060\n He said, how do you know I have a startup?\n\n03:46.060 --> 03:47.360\n I said, you recognize me.\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:50.720\n And I mean, that's the only way.\n\n03:50.720 --> 03:51.800\n And he goes, is that Elon Musk?\n\n03:51.800 --> 03:53.240\n And I said, yes, Elon, come say hi.\n\n03:53.240 --> 03:54.520\n And he came over and said, hi.\n\n03:54.520 --> 03:55.360\n I said, tell me what you do.\n\n03:55.360 --> 03:57.000\n He said, well, I'm a quant.\n\n03:57.000 --> 03:57.920\n I said, what's that?\n\n03:57.920 --> 04:00.960\n And he said, quantitative analysis.\n\n04:00.960 --> 04:02.160\n And I was like, oh yeah, yeah, I know about that.\n\n04:02.160 --> 04:04.040\n That's like you guys make algorithms\n\n04:04.040 --> 04:05.200\n and then try to beat the market, right?\n\n04:05.200 --> 04:06.040\n He's like, yeah.\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:08.360\n I was like, so you're gonna pitch me on a startup\n\n04:08.360 --> 04:10.480\n and you're gonna sell your algorithm to other people.\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:13.080\n And if it was so good, why wouldn't you just use it yourself\n\n04:13.080 --> 04:13.920\n and print money?\n\n04:13.920 --> 04:15.460\n He's like, yeah, yeah, no, no, that's not our business.\n\n04:15.460 --> 04:17.320\n Our business is we're gonna create an app\n\n04:17.320 --> 04:19.680\n to get millennials to trade stocks.\n\n04:19.680 --> 04:22.200\n And he said, hmm, you do realize\n\n04:22.200 --> 04:23.880\n there's no retail investors anymore.\n\n04:23.880 --> 04:27.480\n Like the dot com crash plus the 2008 financial crisis\n\n04:27.480 --> 04:29.680\n eliminated any individual's belief\n\n04:29.680 --> 04:31.720\n in participating in the stock market.\n\n04:31.720 --> 04:32.960\n And he said, that's the opportunity.\n\n04:32.960 --> 04:34.040\n I said, okay, I like it.\n\n04:34.040 --> 04:35.080\n Tell me more.\n\n04:35.080 --> 04:37.060\n He said, well, we're gonna get these millennials to trade.\n\n04:37.060 --> 04:40.660\n I said, the same ones who live in their mom's basements\n\n04:40.660 --> 04:43.380\n and take Uber and Lyft and are on their parents,\n\n04:43.380 --> 04:47.400\n have no money, got screwed and went 250K into debt\n\n04:47.400 --> 04:49.160\n for school and now can't get a job.\n\n04:49.160 --> 04:50.600\n Those people?\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:51.440\n And he's like, yeah.\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:54.460\n I'm like, okay, they have no interest in their future,\n\n04:54.460 --> 04:55.800\n but they're gonna trade stocks.\n\n04:55.800 --> 04:56.720\n He said, yeah, that's the opportunity.\n\n04:56.720 --> 04:58.880\n I was like, how are you gonna make money?\n\n04:58.880 --> 05:00.120\n And he said, well, that's the best part.\n\n05:00.120 --> 05:01.080\n It's gonna be free.\n\n05:02.120 --> 05:04.040\n And I said, so your idea is to get a group of people\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:06.440\n who have no interest in saving for their future\n\n05:06.440 --> 05:08.120\n to trade and your business model is free.\n\n05:08.120 --> 05:08.940\n And he said, yes.\n\n05:08.940 --> 05:10.360\n I said, I'm in.\n\n05:10.360 --> 05:14.440\n Because in almost all cases, the crazy outlandish ideas\n\n05:14.440 --> 05:16.320\n that nobody believes in are the ones\n\n05:16.320 --> 05:17.640\n that have the greatest returns.\n\n05:17.640 --> 05:20.760\n I mean, Uber, I introduced to about 25 investors\n\n05:20.760 --> 05:22.320\n and three of us said yes.\n\n05:22.320 --> 05:26.580\n So a full 12% of the community who saw that deal\n\n05:26.580 --> 05:27.680\n decided to do it.\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:30.840\n So your sense about this idea being good\n\n05:30.840 --> 05:33.920\n had to do with the fact that this guy was just crazy\n\n05:33.920 --> 05:35.520\n and ambitious and bold thinking,\n\n05:35.520 --> 05:37.980\n or was it that there was something here\n\n05:37.980 --> 05:41.080\n in allowing a much larger magnitude of people\n\n05:41.080 --> 05:42.480\n to be able to be investors?\n\n05:42.480 --> 05:46.600\n Yeah, the way to do really well as an angel investor\n\n05:46.600 --> 05:49.320\n or just in technology or in life\n\n05:49.320 --> 05:51.100\n is to not say what could go wrong,\n\n05:51.100 --> 05:52.480\n but to say what could go right.\n\n05:52.480 --> 05:54.640\n And then to just imagine for a moment,\n\n05:54.640 --> 05:58.140\n if it does work, what would the world look like?\n\n05:58.140 --> 06:00.720\n And so when Elon was investing in Tesla\n\n06:00.720 --> 06:02.760\n and some other guys were running it\n\n06:02.760 --> 06:04.720\n and he was trying to save the company,\n\n06:04.720 --> 06:08.160\n it wasn't, is this gonna work?\n\n06:08.160 --> 06:11.840\n It was almost positively not gonna work.\n\n06:11.840 --> 06:14.960\n And he knew that, but if it does work,\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:16.320\n what does the world look like?\n\n06:16.320 --> 06:18.240\n And so that's really what you're looking for\n\n06:18.240 --> 06:21.860\n is not the chances of success,\n\n06:21.860 --> 06:25.160\n but if it does succeed, what would that look like?\n\n06:25.160 --> 06:28.840\n And that's what the world needs more people doing.\n\n06:28.840 --> 06:30.360\n And so when you looked at Robinhood, it was like,\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:32.680\n well, if he does succeed, what would the world look like?\n\n06:32.680 --> 06:34.520\n And now we've seen what it looks like.\n\n06:34.520 --> 06:39.280\n You have a generation who are so financially sophisticated\n\n06:39.280 --> 06:41.680\n that they know how to do puts and calls\n\n06:41.680 --> 06:44.600\n and shorts and research at a level\n\n06:45.640 --> 06:48.560\n that dominated the hedge fund industry.\n\n06:48.560 --> 06:50.520\n So let's pause for a second.\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:52.980\n These traders sitting there on a subreddit\n\n06:52.980 --> 06:56.800\n in a discord server are able to do analysis and research\n\n06:56.800 --> 06:58.880\n and then act in unison to say,\n\n06:58.880 --> 07:03.400\n we're going to beat in the Robinhood sense,\n\n07:03.400 --> 07:05.240\n this group of sophisticated insiders\n\n07:05.240 --> 07:08.040\n who have more access and more access to capital,\n\n07:08.040 --> 07:11.120\n but we will figure out how to solve this problem.\n\n07:11.120 --> 07:13.900\n And most things don't work.\n\n07:14.800 --> 07:16.280\n It's like the Wikipedia.\n\n07:16.280 --> 07:21.280\n There's no way the Wikipedia would ever work, except it did.\n\n07:21.400 --> 07:23.480\n You're like, how is this ever gonna work?\n\n07:23.480 --> 07:24.960\n You're not paying anybody,\n\n07:24.960 --> 07:27.680\n but it's both the largest corpus of an encyclopedia ever.\n\n07:27.680 --> 07:29.880\n So I think Robinhood actually succeeded.\n\n07:29.880 --> 07:33.160\n And then what we saw was this system\n\n07:33.160 --> 07:35.200\n and a lot of the systems in our society,\n\n07:35.200 --> 07:37.240\n whether it's the political system,\n\n07:37.240 --> 07:39.940\n the constitution of the United States,\n\n07:39.940 --> 07:42.960\n education, higher education, which you're involved in,\n\n07:42.960 --> 07:44.640\n and then even the financial system,\n\n07:44.640 --> 07:47.500\n we have not stress tested and stress tested it,\n\n07:47.500 --> 07:50.360\n and we don't actually know all the edge cases\n\n07:50.360 --> 07:51.260\n and how it works.\n\n07:51.260 --> 07:54.800\n So Trump was able to just really put this crazy stress test.\n\n07:56.460 --> 07:59.160\n Is the democracy going to hold?\n\n07:59.160 --> 08:01.360\n Are we gonna break this two or three,\n\n08:01.360 --> 08:03.400\n 200 someone year old experiment?\n\n08:03.400 --> 08:04.720\n And then we looked at the financial markets\n\n08:04.720 --> 08:07.820\n and it turns out there were more people shorting the stock\n\n08:07.820 --> 08:10.160\n than stocks and shares were available.\n\n08:10.160 --> 08:11.560\n I don't know how that's possible.\n\n08:11.560 --> 08:13.200\n And then I'm trying to uncover,\n\n08:13.200 --> 08:15.040\n where can I see a list of people who have shorted the stock?\n\n08:15.040 --> 08:16.640\n And it's like, you can't,\n\n08:16.640 --> 08:19.320\n but we can tell you sort of how many every two weeks\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:21.660\n or maybe twice a week, we can create a report.\n\n08:21.660 --> 08:23.080\n Maybe we know.\n\n08:23.080 --> 08:24.760\n I was surprised that nobody knows\n\n08:24.760 --> 08:26.200\n the list of people who were shorted\n\n08:26.200 --> 08:27.760\n and you guys are trying to figure that out.\n\n08:27.760 --> 08:30.000\n Yeah, there's no transparency on a lot of these systems.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.480\n And if you call to try to short a stock,\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:34.040\n it's almost like they'll tell you on the phone,\n\n08:34.040 --> 08:35.420\n let me see, I think I might know a guy\n\n08:35.420 --> 08:37.040\n who has shares to loan out.\n\n08:37.040 --> 08:39.840\n So it's like, am I calling to try to find\n\n08:39.840 --> 08:43.840\n like a 73 Mustang Grande in gold?\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:45.160\n You're gonna call around, it's like,\n\n08:45.160 --> 08:47.680\n shouldn't this be like on a ledger somewhere\n\n08:47.680 --> 08:49.180\n and be completely transparent?\n\n08:49.180 --> 08:50.920\n So now we're seeing those things.\n\n08:50.920 --> 08:52.920\n And I think the investigations will make it super clear.\n\n08:52.920 --> 08:57.040\n But of course, in a vacuum without information,\n\n08:57.040 --> 08:58.800\n there are so many investors in these startups\n\n08:58.800 --> 09:00.600\n that conflicts can start to appear.\n\n09:00.600 --> 09:01.880\n And then you know how it is with people\n\n09:01.880 --> 09:05.880\n in conspiracy theories, the mind starts to wander, right?\n\n09:05.880 --> 09:08.660\n And so in some cases, there is actually a conspiracy.\n\n09:08.660 --> 09:11.840\n And then in other cases, people's mind will fill in like,\n\n09:11.840 --> 09:13.360\n oh my God, there's some grand conspiracy here.\n\n09:13.360 --> 09:15.080\n I can tell you Robinhood's only goal\n\n09:15.080 --> 09:17.040\n is to get more people to trade stocks\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:18.920\n and to democratize it even more.\n\n09:18.920 --> 09:23.920\n And they apparently were on the brink of seizing as an entity\n\n09:24.920 --> 09:28.080\n if they didn't get more money to cover all these trades.\n\n09:28.080 --> 09:30.120\n I mean, they were on the brink\n\n09:30.120 --> 09:32.200\n and they raised $3.5 billion or something like that\n\n09:32.200 --> 09:33.040\n in a week.\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:37.280\n Yeah, so in some sense, Robinhood enabled this very,\n\n09:37.280 --> 09:39.340\n like the magic of this distributed system\n\n09:39.340 --> 09:41.040\n of WallStreetBets, right?\n\n09:41.040 --> 09:43.320\n You said Wikipedia, which is another,\n\n09:43.320 --> 09:45.400\n which is probably one of my favorite websites\n\n09:45.400 --> 09:48.700\n and one of my favorite examples of like a distributed system\n\n09:48.700 --> 09:50.460\n somehow coming together in a way,\n\n09:50.460 --> 09:53.400\n just like you said at that crappy bar,\n\n09:53.400 --> 09:55.440\n I would have guessed it would never work.\n\n09:55.440 --> 09:58.720\n But if it does work, it changes everything and it did.\n\n09:58.720 --> 10:02.440\n And Robinhood in that same way probably enabled\n\n10:02.440 --> 10:05.240\n or was one of the major enablers of WallStreetBets\n\n10:05.240 --> 10:10.240\n of giving power, like empowering young kids to learn\n\n10:10.720 --> 10:13.760\n about how this whole messy financial system works\n\n10:13.760 --> 10:17.660\n and take on the big elite centralized players.\n\n10:17.660 --> 10:20.000\n Yes, and it's very easy.\n\n10:20.000 --> 10:21.480\n When these companies get big,\n\n10:21.480 --> 10:26.240\n one thing that's changed is the footprint of these startups\n\n10:26.240 --> 10:28.080\n and the velocity at which they grow.\n\n10:28.080 --> 10:30.160\n So something like Airbnb is another perfect example\n\n10:30.160 --> 10:33.080\n of something that should really not work in practice,\n\n10:33.080 --> 10:33.960\n but it does.\n\n10:33.960 --> 10:38.040\n Like I'm gonna rent my couch or my extra room to somebody\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:39.120\n like a serial killer,\n\n10:39.120 --> 10:41.200\n or I'm gonna stay in somebody's house,\n\n10:41.200 --> 10:42.300\n like a serial killer's house.\n\n10:42.300 --> 10:44.720\n And it's like, it really sounds scary,\n\n10:44.720 --> 10:49.200\n but it actually works and it has not destroyed\n\n10:49.200 --> 10:51.200\n the hotel business.\n\n10:51.200 --> 10:52.680\n It has added.\n\n10:52.680 --> 10:55.960\n So the best startups induce a market to exist.\n\n10:55.960 --> 11:00.960\n If you look at Uber or Airbnb, people replace their cars\n\n11:01.640 --> 11:05.400\n and Uber was not competing ultimately with taxis.\n\n11:05.400 --> 11:07.400\n They were competing with car ownership,\n\n11:07.400 --> 11:11.680\n public transportation, walking, or just not going out.\n\n11:11.680 --> 11:12.680\n And then you look at Airbnb,\n\n11:12.680 --> 11:14.280\n a lot of people who stay in an Airbnb\n\n11:14.280 --> 11:17.440\n would not be taking a trip to Kyoto,\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:20.760\n if not for the fact that they could get a $75 beautiful room\n\n11:20.760 --> 11:24.600\n with great reviews in Kyoto for three weeks.\n\n11:24.600 --> 11:27.960\n It inspires people and it manifests the market\n\n11:27.960 --> 11:30.520\n because the product is so transcendent, right?\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:33.400\n And I think that's one of the things that Robinhood did.\n\n11:33.400 --> 11:36.040\n You can't learn how to do this options trading\n\n11:36.040 --> 11:38.680\n and puts and calls and all this sophistication stuff,\n\n11:38.680 --> 11:40.040\n unless you actually do it.\n\n11:40.040 --> 11:42.400\n It's just too hard to learn except in practice,\n\n11:42.400 --> 11:43.440\n just like poker.\n\n11:43.440 --> 11:45.600\n If you wanna learn how to play poker or guitar\n\n11:45.600 --> 11:47.960\n or tennis or skiing, like you can talk about it.\n\n11:47.960 --> 11:49.320\n You can watch YouTube videos,\n\n11:49.320 --> 11:51.160\n but at a certain point, you gotta get on the mountain.\n\n11:51.160 --> 11:54.320\n At a certain point, you gotta put some chips in the pot\n\n11:54.320 --> 11:55.960\n and it's gonna be painful.\n\n11:55.960 --> 11:57.120\n Like poker is gonna be painful.\n\n11:57.120 --> 11:58.240\n You're gonna lose a lot of money\n\n11:58.240 --> 11:59.840\n and that's why you should play at the small tables first.\n\n11:59.840 --> 12:02.240\n And even in trading, like you look at people\n\n12:02.240 --> 12:04.880\n who are doing this crazy trading and GameStop,\n\n12:04.880 --> 12:07.840\n a company that's worth maybe a couple of billion dollars,\n\n12:07.840 --> 12:10.000\n but certainly not tens of billions of dollars.\n\n12:10.000 --> 12:12.080\n Of course, the people who are throwing their money in last\n\n12:12.080 --> 12:13.240\n are gonna lose it.\n\n12:13.240 --> 12:15.480\n I think everybody knew that.\n\n12:15.480 --> 12:16.760\n And so it was a momentum play\n\n12:16.760 --> 12:19.520\n and they're betting against the hedge funds.\n\n12:19.520 --> 12:22.160\n So I think it's good for people to learn\n\n12:22.160 --> 12:23.480\n and become financially literate\n\n12:23.480 --> 12:27.640\n and just always understand the concept of the risk of ruin.\n\n12:27.640 --> 12:29.040\n The good news is for a young person,\n\n12:29.040 --> 12:31.760\n the risk of ruin might be like they lose $5,000 or something\n\n12:31.760 --> 12:33.640\n and then they have to build their stack back up.\n\n12:33.640 --> 12:36.240\n But that's really the only thing I am concerned about\n\n12:36.240 --> 12:40.320\n is there are people who will play poker or blackjack\n\n12:40.320 --> 12:43.080\n or sports betting or whatever it is and lose control.\n\n12:43.080 --> 12:45.680\n Just like there might be people who try alcohol\n\n12:45.680 --> 12:46.640\n and lose control.\n\n12:46.640 --> 12:49.920\n But we can't build a system based upon limiting\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:53.200\n the average person's behavior based upon somebody\n\n12:53.200 --> 12:56.520\n who can't control their ability to drink.\n\n12:56.520 --> 12:58.120\n Two glasses of wine instead of 20.\n\n12:58.120 --> 13:00.240\n How does this whole thing end?\n\n13:00.240 --> 13:01.800\n Probably in tears.\n\n13:01.800 --> 13:02.640\n For who?\n\n13:02.640 --> 13:03.480\n Yeah.\n\n13:03.480 --> 13:04.320\n Who's crying?\n\n13:04.320 --> 13:05.160\n Is everybody crying?\n\n13:05.160 --> 13:06.000\n Exactly.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:06.840\n Who's crying when?\n\n13:06.840 --> 13:08.040\n So I think there were some of the hedge funds\n\n13:08.040 --> 13:09.200\n that were crying initially.\n\n13:09.200 --> 13:10.920\n That maybe some of the Wall Street Bets people\n\n13:10.920 --> 13:13.000\n who bought last would be crying.\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.840\n And then eventually there's probably another set\n\n13:15.840 --> 13:19.080\n of hedge funds or even the Wall Street Bets mob\n\n13:19.080 --> 13:22.240\n and that army, some of them might've broke ranks\n\n13:22.240 --> 13:23.720\n and then shorted the stock.\n\n13:23.720 --> 13:24.760\n So nobody knows.\n\n13:24.760 --> 13:26.960\n So everybody has to be aware of what's happening\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:27.920\n in the game.\n\n13:27.920 --> 13:29.720\n So if Wall Street Bets said, hey, let's squeeze\n\n13:29.720 --> 13:32.080\n these hedge funds because they have too much short interest.\n\n13:32.080 --> 13:33.800\n Let's all buy the stock.\n\n13:33.800 --> 13:35.640\n Then some of them might've said, okay,\n\n13:35.640 --> 13:37.800\n you know, it's at two or $300.\n\n13:37.800 --> 13:40.640\n Maybe I'll join the short movement now that they've covered.\n\n13:40.640 --> 13:43.600\n And they could have shorted their been like double agent.\n\n13:43.600 --> 13:46.920\n So people have to understand like this stuff is gnarly\n\n13:46.920 --> 13:48.360\n and it's a free for all.\n\n13:48.360 --> 13:49.800\n I mean, it is a literal free for all.\n\n13:49.800 --> 13:51.440\n There's a kind of morality,\n\n13:51.440 --> 13:54.320\n like a big statement that Wall Street Bets made\n\n13:54.320 --> 13:57.680\n in terms of like the elites can't just push us around.\n\n13:57.680 --> 13:59.520\n They can't bully around.\n\n13:59.520 --> 14:01.440\n But at the same time, you know,\n\n14:01.440 --> 14:03.480\n they're also interested in making money, right?\n\n14:03.480 --> 14:05.920\n What's your sense?\n\n14:05.920 --> 14:08.040\n You said that some of the people in the Wall Street Bets\n\n14:08.040 --> 14:10.360\n might've broken off and shorted the stock.\n\n14:10.360 --> 14:11.920\n Are they more interested?\n\n14:11.920 --> 14:15.280\n There was an emergent like morality that emerged\n\n14:15.280 --> 14:17.960\n and said like, we're not gonna put up\n\n14:17.960 --> 14:19.440\n with the centralized elites,\n\n14:19.440 --> 14:22.440\n but is that going to continue?\n\n14:22.440 --> 14:24.600\n Are they going to fight the power structures\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:26.280\n that are bad for society?\n\n14:26.280 --> 14:28.680\n Or are they going to now like,\n\n14:28.680 --> 14:31.040\n I mean, are they ultimately going to introduce more chaos\n\n14:31.040 --> 14:33.440\n that's going to damage the economy and damage the world?\n\n14:33.440 --> 14:35.520\n Or are they going to continue being the good guys\n\n14:35.520 --> 14:40.520\n and fighting the evils that manipulate the market?\n\n14:40.520 --> 14:41.920\n What's your sense?\n\n14:41.920 --> 14:44.640\n You know, it really feels like the Dark Knight series\n\n14:44.640 --> 14:46.360\n of films where like some people\n\n14:46.360 --> 14:48.000\n just want to see the world burn.\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:49.760\n I think there is a contingent of people\n\n14:49.760 --> 14:52.200\n who just literally want to see chaos.\n\n14:52.200 --> 14:56.000\n Like, you know that contingent on some of these forums\n\n14:56.000 --> 14:58.640\n who just want to create chaos, right?\n\n14:58.640 --> 15:00.520\n So there's certainly that chaos contingent,\n\n15:00.520 --> 15:02.360\n but I think overall what the arc will show\n\n15:02.360 --> 15:05.200\n is a group of people getting massively educated.\n\n15:05.200 --> 15:06.840\n You see it in crypto as well.\n\n15:06.840 --> 15:08.640\n There was like a three year period\n\n15:08.640 --> 15:13.080\n where all of these failed entrepreneurs who I knew\n\n15:13.080 --> 15:17.440\n who couldn't build companies were then coming back to me\n\n15:17.440 --> 15:19.760\n after their companies has failed or after they gave up\n\n15:19.760 --> 15:21.000\n or couldn't clear market raising money\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:22.800\n with the venture capital community\n\n15:22.800 --> 15:24.760\n and they were doing ICOs.\n\n15:24.760 --> 15:27.560\n And I was like, I met you before, right?\n\n15:27.560 --> 15:28.400\n And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n15:28.400 --> 15:29.320\n No, I'm doing an ICO now.\n\n15:29.320 --> 15:32.440\n I'm like, okay, where's your company at?\n\n15:32.440 --> 15:33.680\n And they're like, here's a white paper.\n\n15:33.680 --> 15:36.480\n And I was like, this white paper with spelling errors in it\n\n15:36.480 --> 15:39.240\n that says you're going to destroy Airbnb\n\n15:39.240 --> 15:40.720\n because everybody's apartment\n\n15:40.720 --> 15:42.760\n is gonna be on an immutable ledger.\n\n15:42.760 --> 15:44.800\n Like, wouldn't that be better in a regular database\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:46.640\n that was private and not public?\n\n15:46.640 --> 15:48.640\n Like, why does it need to be on an immutable ledger?\n\n15:48.640 --> 15:49.480\n It can't change.\n\n15:49.480 --> 15:52.960\n I'm like, not changing the database is a feature?\n\n15:52.960 --> 15:54.760\n That does not seem like a good feature.\n\n15:54.760 --> 15:55.600\n And they couldn't explain it.\n\n15:55.600 --> 15:57.520\n They're like, well, just people are interested in ICOs.\n\n15:57.520 --> 15:59.240\n And there was that ICO mania.\n\n15:59.240 --> 16:01.840\n And what it showed was there's a global appetite for risk.\n\n16:01.840 --> 16:05.040\n People want to try new things.\n\n16:05.040 --> 16:07.080\n This is one of the great things about the human spirit\n\n16:07.080 --> 16:09.200\n is one of the great things about capitalism.\n\n16:09.200 --> 16:11.400\n And one of the things that concerns me most\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:12.480\n about where we're at in society\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:15.480\n is the sort of socialism, communism,\n\n16:17.080 --> 16:19.680\n entrepreneurship is bad, technology is bad,\n\n16:19.680 --> 16:21.480\n and polarization of wealth,\n\n16:21.480 --> 16:23.280\n and people getting rich is a bad thing.\n\n16:23.280 --> 16:24.880\n When I grew up, I'm 50 now,\n\n16:24.880 --> 16:26.600\n but when I was a Gen Xer growing up,\n\n16:26.600 --> 16:29.280\n we kind of maybe too much idolized Bill Gates\n\n16:29.280 --> 16:31.160\n and people who were doing interesting things in the world.\n\n16:31.160 --> 16:32.960\n And we thought capitalism was a force for good.\n\n16:32.960 --> 16:35.720\n I still believe capitalism is a force for good\n\n16:35.720 --> 16:39.400\n because when a group of people build a product or service\n\n16:39.400 --> 16:42.480\n that changes the world and it gets globally distributed,\n\n16:42.480 --> 16:46.040\n whether it's Tesla or SpaceX or Google or Airbnb\n\n16:46.040 --> 16:47.440\n or Uber or Robinhood,\n\n16:48.680 --> 16:51.960\n everybody gets to benefit from that product or service\n\n16:51.960 --> 16:52.920\n having to compete.\n\n16:52.920 --> 16:55.000\n And if you look at the places where there's no competition\n\n16:55.000 --> 17:00.000\n like public education or less established colleges\n\n17:00.000 --> 17:00.840\n and something like that,\n\n17:00.840 --> 17:03.360\n less competition for accreditation degrees,\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:06.200\n like things tend to get a little weird, don't they?\n\n17:06.200 --> 17:09.040\n And people tend to be protected and that's not good.\n\n17:09.040 --> 17:11.440\n You need competition.\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:14.720\n Doesn't mean that people shouldn't have global healthcare.\n\n17:14.720 --> 17:17.000\n It doesn't mean that we shouldn't have a safety net,\n\n17:17.000 --> 17:18.920\n but we need to keep capitalism vibrant,\n\n17:18.920 --> 17:22.080\n especially because China has now coopted capitalism\n\n17:22.080 --> 17:24.640\n and created their own version of capitalism,\n\n17:24.640 --> 17:26.640\n which is communism with capitalism.\n\n17:26.640 --> 17:28.040\n It's like this weird operating system\n\n17:28.040 --> 17:30.160\n like we still want to keep communism\n\n17:30.160 --> 17:33.240\n so we can take any of your gains at any time,\n\n17:33.240 --> 17:35.120\n but we'd like you to be entrepreneurial.\n\n17:35.120 --> 17:40.120\n And then you have somebody like the founder of Alibaba,\n\n17:40.200 --> 17:42.880\n Jack Ma, who disappears for a couple of weeks.\n\n17:42.880 --> 17:43.720\n Who's that?\n\n17:43.720 --> 17:45.000\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n17:45.000 --> 17:45.840\n Who's Jack Ma?\n\n17:45.840 --> 17:48.280\n I was like, he kind of disappears for a couple of weeks\n\n17:48.280 --> 17:49.960\n and then he comes back and he's really sorry\n\n17:49.960 --> 17:52.800\n about the things he said and then he disappears again.\n\n17:52.800 --> 17:55.400\n And like, we have to be very careful.\n\n17:55.400 --> 17:58.800\n You know, we have to be very careful if China wins\n\n17:58.800 --> 18:03.280\n capitalism, this is going to be an existential threat\n\n18:03.280 --> 18:05.440\n for humanity.\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:07.640\n The Chinese are no joke.\n\n18:07.640 --> 18:09.920\n I mean, they are seriously focused\n\n18:09.920 --> 18:11.960\n and they are picking the winners.\n\n18:11.960 --> 18:14.920\n It's a very weird system because it is in fact,\n\n18:14.920 --> 18:15.960\n I don't know what you call it.\n\n18:15.960 --> 18:19.360\n Like communism and capitalism is such a overloaded terms,\n\n18:19.360 --> 18:22.320\n but they do encourage entrepreneurship,\n\n18:22.320 --> 18:25.000\n but they, and they do a good job of it.\n\n18:25.000 --> 18:25.840\n Oh, yes.\n\n18:25.840 --> 18:28.960\n But then they're like, they're like the surveillance thing\n\n18:28.960 --> 18:31.000\n and they're controlling things in a way.\n\n18:31.000 --> 18:34.840\n It's weird because it seems to work really well for them\n\n18:35.720 --> 18:36.640\n in the short term.\n\n18:36.640 --> 18:38.360\n Yes, it's definitely got short term benefits.\n\n18:38.360 --> 18:42.480\n So the question is like, how that gets distorted\n\n18:42.480 --> 18:44.360\n and it becomes worse and worse and worse,\n\n18:44.360 --> 18:45.800\n which it potentially might be.\n\n18:45.800 --> 18:50.800\n And I think on, you know, the entrepreneurial spirit,\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:53.840\n which you have a podcast all centered\n\n18:53.840 --> 18:56.240\n around the entrepreneurial spirit,\n\n18:56.240 --> 18:59.200\n is one of the magical things that makes this country great.\n\n18:59.200 --> 19:02.200\n I don't know if money is deeply tied into that.\n\n19:02.200 --> 19:05.320\n I do get bothered by people, you know,\n\n19:05.320 --> 19:08.440\n treating the word billionaires if it's a bad word.\n\n19:08.440 --> 19:12.120\n But in general, like all the hard things,\n\n19:12.120 --> 19:14.200\n all the difficult things we're going through in this country,\n\n19:14.200 --> 19:17.280\n it seems like the way out is going to be\n\n19:19.440 --> 19:22.920\n making the entrepreneur the hero of society\n\n19:22.920 --> 19:26.400\n of like letting that young kid with a big dream\n\n19:26.400 --> 19:28.200\n and the guts to take the big risks\n\n19:28.200 --> 19:29.800\n and build something totally new,\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:34.000\n giving them a chance and whatever that involves.\n\n19:34.000 --> 19:35.520\n I don't think it's about taxes.\n\n19:35.520 --> 19:38.720\n I don't think it's about like regulation, all that stuff.\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:42.120\n It's about us and just public discourse saying\n\n19:42.120 --> 19:45.680\n that kid, that guy, that girl, they're bad asses.\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:47.440\n Like encourage them to do it.\n\n19:47.440 --> 19:49.800\n We have to have people buy in\n\n19:49.800 --> 19:52.640\n to the fact that they have that opportunity.\n\n19:52.640 --> 19:55.360\n And I think one of the problems in society is\n\n19:55.360 --> 19:57.840\n there's a group of people who actually don't believe\n\n19:57.840 --> 20:00.240\n that they can succeed or they don't believe\n\n20:00.240 --> 20:02.960\n even more perniciously that other people can.\n\n20:02.960 --> 20:06.440\n And that's the group of people that I think are highly vocal\n\n20:06.440 --> 20:07.840\n but a small group of people,\n\n20:07.840 --> 20:11.600\n which are generally people of incredible privilege,\n\n20:11.600 --> 20:15.360\n rich parents, white city dwellers, liberals.\n\n20:15.360 --> 20:16.520\n They kind of look and say,\n\n20:16.520 --> 20:18.880\n poor people cannot change it a lot.\n\n20:18.880 --> 20:21.680\n And they're battling in their minds\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:23.320\n to protect poor people.\n\n20:23.320 --> 20:24.480\n But they have this very weird\n\n20:24.480 --> 20:26.160\n patriarchal kind of approach to it,\n\n20:26.160 --> 20:28.320\n which is they think that they're not capable\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:29.720\n of changing their lot in life.\n\n20:29.720 --> 20:31.480\n And they're like, it's not possible.\n\n20:31.480 --> 20:34.280\n And then once in a while, I'll tweet something where I say,\n\n20:34.280 --> 20:36.680\n it's really incredible that every piece of knowledge\n\n20:36.680 --> 20:39.840\n you could possibly want is now available for free on YouTube.\n\n20:40.840 --> 20:43.880\n And every course from MIT and Harvard and Stanford\n\n20:43.880 --> 20:46.200\n is available on edX or Coursera.\n\n20:46.200 --> 20:49.240\n And all that information is there freely available.\n\n20:49.240 --> 20:50.960\n And you can take the lectures.\n\n20:50.960 --> 20:51.800\n This is amazing.\n\n20:51.800 --> 20:52.800\n And then people will be like,\n\n20:52.800 --> 20:54.360\n yeah, but people don't have access to it.\n\n20:54.360 --> 20:55.840\n I'm like, they do.\n\n20:55.840 --> 20:56.680\n It's free.\n\n20:56.680 --> 20:57.520\n Here's the link.\n\n20:57.520 --> 20:59.400\n And they're like, yeah, but they don't have internet.\n\n20:59.400 --> 21:01.360\n And I'm like, here's the chart\n\n21:01.360 --> 21:03.560\n of internet penetration in America.\n\n21:03.560 --> 21:05.080\n And they're like, well, poor people don't have internet.\n\n21:05.080 --> 21:07.400\n And I'm like, really?\n\n21:07.400 --> 21:11.200\n Find me any downtrodden person without a smartphone\n\n21:11.200 --> 21:12.400\n with a high speed connection\n\n21:12.400 --> 21:16.400\n that capitalism provided for $12 a month or $15 a month.\n\n21:16.400 --> 21:18.240\n It's very hard to find that.\n\n21:18.240 --> 21:20.960\n And we have it so well in this country\n\n21:20.960 --> 21:22.600\n and there's so much opportunity,\n\n21:23.720 --> 21:25.720\n but people don't believe it.\n\n21:25.720 --> 21:27.200\n And that's actually one of the problems.\n\n21:27.200 --> 21:28.440\n See, the average American still watches\n\n21:28.440 --> 21:30.560\n four or five hours of television a day.\n\n21:30.560 --> 21:32.000\n And often I meet people and they're like,\n\n21:32.000 --> 21:33.600\n I need a technical co founder.\n\n21:35.160 --> 21:36.600\n But all I need is a million dollars.\n\n21:36.600 --> 21:37.840\n And I'm like, okay, well, what is your skill?\n\n21:37.840 --> 21:39.280\n And they don't have a skill.\n\n21:39.280 --> 21:41.600\n And I'm like, well, are you a designer?\n\n21:41.600 --> 21:42.440\n No.\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:43.260\n Are you a product manager?\n\n21:43.260 --> 21:44.100\n No.\n\n21:44.100 --> 21:44.940\n Are you a developer?\n\n21:44.940 --> 21:45.760\n No.\n\n21:45.760 --> 21:46.600\n Are you a sales executive?\n\n21:46.600 --> 21:47.440\n No.\n\n21:47.440 --> 21:48.280\n Do you have an idea?\n\n21:48.280 --> 21:50.080\n Well, as my friend, Sam Harris,\n\n21:50.080 --> 21:53.060\n I think your friend as well says like,\n\n21:53.060 --> 21:55.320\n everybody has like a million ideas an hour.\n\n21:55.320 --> 21:57.160\n Like you don't really get credit for those.\n\n21:57.160 --> 21:59.760\n Even when you're asleep, your idea is spewing ideas.\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:01.640\n Like zero credit for your ideas.\n\n22:01.640 --> 22:03.240\n It's all about execution.\n\n22:03.240 --> 22:04.080\n And we're seeing.\n\n22:04.080 --> 22:04.920\n You have to believe that you yourself\n\n22:04.920 --> 22:06.840\n can be the core of that execution.\n\n22:06.840 --> 22:08.960\n You yourself can build the thing in every,\n\n22:08.960 --> 22:10.960\n no matter what your circumstances are.\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:13.200\n I mean, we could talk about like structural racism\n\n22:13.200 --> 22:15.320\n and all those kinds of things that push things down.\n\n22:15.320 --> 22:17.320\n But from the individual perspective,\n\n22:17.320 --> 22:18.680\n when you just like are coaching\n\n22:18.680 --> 22:20.800\n or giving advice to an individual,\n\n22:20.800 --> 22:22.080\n you can literally change the world.\n\n22:22.080 --> 22:24.160\n I mean, Wall Street Bets is an indication of that\n\n22:24.160 --> 22:27.000\n in the financial space that you yourself can have,\n\n22:27.000 --> 22:28.120\n can change the world.\n\n22:28.120 --> 22:30.240\n That's why this country is amazing.\n\n22:30.240 --> 22:31.600\n Still the best country in the world, right?\n\n22:31.600 --> 22:33.960\n I mean, it still is amazing the opportunity\n\n22:33.960 --> 22:35.360\n provided to people.\n\n22:35.360 --> 22:37.440\n All this educational experience is online.\n\n22:37.440 --> 22:39.720\n And the ability, what I tell young people\n\n22:39.720 --> 22:42.080\n who are looking for advice, I say,\n\n22:42.080 --> 22:43.880\n the skill you need to refine\n\n22:43.880 --> 22:45.960\n is the ability to learn new skills.\n\n22:45.960 --> 22:49.160\n Like if you become good at learning a new skill,\n\n22:49.160 --> 22:52.680\n and Tim Ferriss, a friend of mine has really pioneered this,\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:57.680\n he can get to 60 or 70% of like the knowledge\n\n22:57.680 --> 23:00.320\n in a skill in some incredibly short period of time.\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:02.760\n And I'm not saying he's gonna become a virtuoso drummer\n\n23:02.760 --> 23:03.800\n or a great basketball player,\n\n23:03.800 --> 23:06.280\n but Tim and I were on vacation together\n\n23:06.280 --> 23:07.760\n in like a group vacation in Italy\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:09.520\n and there was a basketball court.\n\n23:09.520 --> 23:11.720\n And I said, let's go shoot some hoops.\n\n23:11.720 --> 23:13.040\n I'd never shot before.\n\n23:13.040 --> 23:15.120\n And I was like, okay, come on, I'll teach you.\n\n23:15.120 --> 23:17.640\n And Tim is fabulously uncoordinated.\n\n23:17.640 --> 23:18.880\n People don't know this.\n\n23:18.880 --> 23:23.880\n Like he tried to dribble a basketball and do a layup\n\n23:24.160 --> 23:26.600\n and it looked like he had a blindfold on.\n\n23:26.600 --> 23:29.800\n I mean, you've never seen something less elegant\n\n23:29.800 --> 23:32.000\n than Tim Ferriss doing a layup in basketball.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:34.680\n And then he watched me do it three or four times\n\n23:34.680 --> 23:37.160\n and I watched him study me.\n\n23:37.160 --> 23:39.280\n And listen, I've been playing basketball in Brooklyn\n\n23:39.280 --> 23:40.400\n since I was a kid.\n\n23:40.400 --> 23:43.120\n I got a couple of moves and he was just taking notes\n\n23:43.120 --> 23:44.400\n and taking notes and taking notes.\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:46.960\n And by the end of a couple of hours of doing this,\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:48.800\n I could just watch him checking his form\n\n23:48.800 --> 23:50.520\n and figuring it out.\n\n23:50.520 --> 23:52.800\n That's every skill in the world now.\n\n23:52.800 --> 23:55.440\n And what I tell people is like, I'm like,\n\n23:55.440 --> 23:56.520\n did you watch Game of Thrones?\n\n23:56.520 --> 23:57.880\n And they're like, yeah.\n\n23:57.880 --> 23:58.720\n Watch Breaking Bad?\n\n23:58.720 --> 24:01.400\n Like, yeah, I'm like, okay, that's about 400 hours.\n\n24:02.840 --> 24:05.160\n How about you don't watch the next two\n\n24:05.160 --> 24:06.720\n and you put that 400 hours into learning\n\n24:06.720 --> 24:09.640\n how to be a graphic designer, a UX person,\n\n24:09.640 --> 24:13.800\n a developer, whatever it is and learn how to add skills.\n\n24:13.800 --> 24:14.760\n That's what I did my whole life.\n\n24:14.760 --> 24:17.120\n I was a kid from Brooklyn, went to school at night,\n\n24:17.120 --> 24:20.200\n but I was very quick to get to maybe 50%\n\n24:20.200 --> 24:22.080\n of the knowledge base of graphic design\n\n24:22.080 --> 24:24.360\n or being a writer or being a sales executive,\n\n24:24.360 --> 24:26.520\n whatever it was, a developer even.\n\n24:26.520 --> 24:29.080\n And I was just good enough to not have people\n\n24:29.080 --> 24:31.440\n be able to bullshit me like when I hired them.\n\n24:31.440 --> 24:33.520\n And that was a big unlock.\n\n24:33.520 --> 24:35.840\n When you know enough that people can't snow you,\n\n24:35.840 --> 24:36.840\n that's a really good one.\n\n24:36.840 --> 24:38.520\n And look at yourself.\n\n24:38.520 --> 24:40.560\n You figured out how to set up an entire podcast,\n\n24:40.560 --> 24:41.400\n people don't know this,\n\n24:41.400 --> 24:43.240\n but you don't have a team around you.\n\n24:43.240 --> 24:45.360\n I have a team of like five, six people working on my podcast.\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:48.120\n With even knowing enough about to set this up,\n\n24:48.120 --> 24:50.000\n you would then be able to hire a team.\n\n24:50.000 --> 24:50.840\n Correct.\n\n24:50.840 --> 24:52.040\n And you'll be able to call them on their bullshit\n\n24:52.040 --> 24:53.720\n if they're not doing a good job.\n\n24:53.720 --> 24:54.560\n And that's really important.\n\n24:54.560 --> 24:56.240\n And I don't know that much about this whole thing,\n\n24:56.240 --> 24:58.280\n but I know enough to be able to then see\n\n24:58.280 --> 24:59.960\n who knows their stuff and not.\n\n24:59.960 --> 25:00.800\n You're absolutely right.\n\n25:00.800 --> 25:03.640\n And the process of learning how to learn\n\n25:03.640 --> 25:08.640\n is essential there because I did martial arts,\n\n25:08.720 --> 25:09.880\n jiu jitsu and so on.\n\n25:09.880 --> 25:11.400\n And it's so funny to watch.\n\n25:11.400 --> 25:12.240\n I did Taekwondo, yeah.\n\n25:12.240 --> 25:13.560\n Taekwondo is awesome.\n\n25:13.560 --> 25:15.040\n It's funny that there's some people\n\n25:15.040 --> 25:17.520\n that do an activity for years,\n\n25:17.520 --> 25:19.920\n because just sort of elaborate on something\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:21.840\n you were saying about hours.\n\n25:21.840 --> 25:24.960\n It's not always the amount of hours,\n\n25:24.960 --> 25:26.680\n it's the quality that you put in.\n\n25:26.680 --> 25:29.680\n Deliberate practice versus just doing some behavior.\n\n25:29.680 --> 25:31.480\n I mean, literally I've been playing chess\n\n25:31.480 --> 25:33.040\n and trying to get that going again\n\n25:33.040 --> 25:35.520\n after watching Queen's Gambit and I got chess.com.\n\n25:35.520 --> 25:36.680\n And I realized I was just playing\n\n25:36.680 --> 25:37.520\n and I'm not getting better.\n\n25:37.520 --> 25:38.360\n And then I was like, oh wait,\n\n25:38.360 --> 25:40.640\n there's a little analysis feature here in chess.com\n\n25:40.640 --> 25:43.160\n where it will show you your blunders and mistakes.\n\n25:43.160 --> 25:45.440\n And I'm like, oh, I'm spending no time\n\n25:45.440 --> 25:47.640\n reviewing my losses in chess\n\n25:47.640 --> 25:49.120\n and I just wanna play the next game.\n\n25:49.120 --> 25:50.880\n I should really review these losses\n\n25:50.880 --> 25:52.080\n and figure out what mistakes I made.\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:52.920\n And when I started doing that,\n\n25:52.920 --> 25:54.920\n I was like, oh, I'm getting better.\n\n25:54.920 --> 25:56.400\n So some deliberate practice really works.\n\n25:56.400 --> 25:58.160\n And if you wanna take it all the way,\n\n25:58.160 --> 26:00.440\n Magnus Carlsen, shout out to the guy,\n\n26:00.440 --> 26:03.200\n he has an app, but there's a few other coaching apps\n\n26:03.200 --> 26:04.880\n where you focus on the end game,\n\n26:04.880 --> 26:07.320\n you focus drilling a particular,\n\n26:07.320 --> 26:09.120\n you basically don't play the game at all.\n\n26:09.120 --> 26:11.960\n You just focus on drilling the different aspects.\n\n26:11.960 --> 26:14.000\n The openings, the end game, the end game, yeah.\n\n26:14.000 --> 26:15.320\n And there's different kinds of puzzles.\n\n26:15.320 --> 26:18.080\n So you can really make it into a deliberate practice.\n\n26:18.080 --> 26:20.720\n Not to make this episode sponsored by chess.com,\n\n26:20.720 --> 26:22.200\n but they literally have puzzles.\n\n26:22.200 --> 26:25.040\n So I was like, oh, and it's $100 a year for this product.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:28.520\n And I just thought to myself, this is capitalism.\n\n26:28.520 --> 26:31.640\n They don't need to charge you $100 an hour for a lesson.\n\n26:32.640 --> 26:34.120\n They can charge you $100\n\n26:34.120 --> 26:36.280\n and they've created the ability for you to play chess\n\n26:36.280 --> 26:38.320\n 24 hours a day against opponents\n\n26:38.320 --> 26:41.520\n who are perfectly matched against you based on your rating.\n\n26:41.520 --> 26:44.120\n And they analyze every game and they have puzzles\n\n26:44.120 --> 26:46.320\n and they have tutorials and they've got everything else.\n\n26:46.320 --> 26:50.320\n It's like, just think about how much value\n\n26:50.320 --> 26:53.440\n is being provided to society because of capitalism\n\n26:53.440 --> 26:54.480\n and because competition.\n\n26:54.480 --> 26:56.320\n If you want things to get better\n\n26:56.320 --> 26:58.120\n and you wanna step up your game,\n\n26:58.120 --> 26:59.680\n just make it slightly competitive.\n\n26:59.680 --> 27:03.480\n It is one of these things in human existence\n\n27:03.480 --> 27:05.040\n that is so powerful.\n\n27:05.040 --> 27:07.120\n I don't know, did you see the Michael Jordan documentary,\n\n27:07.120 --> 27:08.080\n The Last Dance?\n\n27:08.080 --> 27:10.480\n Like half of it, I'm still working through it.\n\n27:10.480 --> 27:14.320\n He's so competitive and petty.\n\n27:14.320 --> 27:19.000\n It's so inspiring that all he cares about is just winning\n\n27:19.000 --> 27:21.160\n to the level of which he literally,\n\n27:21.160 --> 27:23.960\n there's like this running meme, I took that personally\n\n27:23.960 --> 27:24.840\n and I took that person.\n\n27:24.840 --> 27:26.480\n I don't know if you've seen the images of him\n\n27:26.480 --> 27:27.600\n sitting smoking a cigar,\n\n27:27.600 --> 27:29.400\n looking at like an iPad or a video clip\n\n27:29.400 --> 27:30.960\n and it's like, I took that personally.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:32.040\n And you can make a super cut\n\n27:32.040 --> 27:33.720\n of every time he took something personally,\n\n27:33.720 --> 27:35.400\n he literally takes everything personally\n\n27:35.400 --> 27:38.320\n to give himself that competitive motivation to win.\n\n27:38.320 --> 27:39.920\n That's capitalism.\n\n27:39.920 --> 27:42.080\n And when people are competing,\n\n27:42.080 --> 27:46.600\n man, look at what Elon did to the space of cars.\n\n27:46.600 --> 27:49.360\n Like every, they were literally laughing at him\n\n27:49.360 --> 27:50.720\n in the first 10 years.\n\n27:50.720 --> 27:53.360\n Electric cars, ha ha, that company will go out of business.\n\n27:53.360 --> 27:55.600\n And now every single company is like,\n\n27:55.600 --> 27:58.400\n we're going fully electric by 2035.\n\n27:58.400 --> 28:02.240\n And he kicked their asses so brutally\n\n28:02.240 --> 28:05.760\n that they had no choice but then to step up their game.\n\n28:05.760 --> 28:07.280\n And that's what we want, right?\n\n28:07.280 --> 28:09.320\n And this virus and this pandemic,\n\n28:09.320 --> 28:12.880\n I think the great thing that will come out\n\n28:12.880 --> 28:15.120\n of this horrible experience that we've all had\n\n28:15.120 --> 28:17.640\n is psychologically death, learning,\n\n28:17.640 --> 28:19.080\n just so many bad things occurred,\n\n28:19.080 --> 28:21.080\n the economy, people losing their jobs.\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:22.800\n But we also got to see the human spirit\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:27.200\n with these mRNA vaccines and just how,\n\n28:27.200 --> 28:29.400\n if we took out some of the regulation\n\n28:29.400 --> 28:31.280\n and people were super motivated,\n\n28:31.280 --> 28:33.880\n we might actually be able to eliminate\n\n28:33.880 --> 28:38.520\n all pandemics from ever happening again.\n\n28:38.520 --> 28:40.840\n And before that, Bill Gates was banging his fist\n\n28:40.840 --> 28:43.720\n and Jeff Skoll was doing the movie Contagion.\n\n28:43.720 --> 28:45.960\n I mean, for two decades, people have been banging their fist.\n\n28:45.960 --> 28:47.640\n We have to be prepared for this.\n\n28:47.640 --> 28:49.680\n And everybody's like, yeah, whatever, YOLO.\n\n28:49.680 --> 28:50.800\n It's not gonna happen.\n\n28:50.800 --> 28:53.040\n And now it's happened and people are like,\n\n28:53.040 --> 28:57.600\n we need to be able to destroy every pandemic and virus\n\n28:57.600 --> 28:58.440\n before it happens.\n\n28:58.440 --> 29:01.640\n And listen, you know a lot more about science than I do,\n\n29:01.640 --> 29:04.400\n but these mRNA has been around for a while.\n\n29:04.400 --> 29:06.920\n We've just never gotten aggressive about doing it.\n\n29:06.920 --> 29:09.120\n And then you think about challenge trials.\n\n29:09.120 --> 29:10.240\n I don't know if you've been following this,\n\n29:10.240 --> 29:13.640\n but they're doing challenge trials now in the UK this month\n\n29:13.640 --> 29:17.480\n where they're introducing COVID into healthy young patients\n\n29:17.480 --> 29:19.920\n and then giving them the vaccine or, you know.\n\n29:19.920 --> 29:24.440\n And that is against all rules and regulations\n\n29:24.440 --> 29:27.280\n about do no harm.\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:29.040\n But then you think about it.\n\n29:29.040 --> 29:31.480\n We kind of celebrate people jumping out of planes\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:33.560\n and we got that one guy, Alex Honnold,\n\n29:33.560 --> 29:35.320\n who's climbing up mountains without a rope\n\n29:35.320 --> 29:37.200\n and they give him a North Star, you know,\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:41.680\n back page ad and an endorsement deal.\n\n29:41.680 --> 29:42.840\n And we celebrate that.\n\n29:42.840 --> 29:45.040\n We celebrate people surfing with sharks.\n\n29:45.040 --> 29:47.560\n We celebrate people doing deep welding.\n\n29:47.560 --> 29:50.440\n We pay them extra to go 200 feet underground\n\n29:50.440 --> 29:51.720\n and weld stuff.\n\n29:51.720 --> 29:57.360\n And people do dangerous stuff all day long, astronauts.\n\n29:57.360 --> 30:00.840\n But we won't, soldiers, firefighters,\n\n30:00.840 --> 30:04.560\n but we won't let people get paid to do a challenge trial.\n\n30:04.560 --> 30:06.800\n Yeah, we're weirdly risk averse in certain areas\n\n30:06.800 --> 30:08.080\n that completely don't make any sense.\n\n30:08.080 --> 30:10.120\n And this is where the world needs it.\n\n30:10.120 --> 30:13.280\n We could have said these thousand people, young people,\n\n30:13.280 --> 30:14.840\n who we know are in all likelihood\n\n30:14.840 --> 30:16.600\n not going to have a bad outcome,\n\n30:16.600 --> 30:17.520\n but there's a possibility.\n\n30:17.520 --> 30:18.360\n There's a possibility.\n\n30:18.360 --> 30:19.200\n But it's very low.\n\n30:19.200 --> 30:22.040\n It's certainly lower than riding a motorcycle.\n\n30:22.040 --> 30:23.240\n It's lower than riding a motorcycle.\n\n30:23.240 --> 30:24.400\n People ride motorcycles everywhere.\n\n30:24.400 --> 30:26.120\n We have ads for motorcycles.\n\n30:26.120 --> 30:27.480\n We could have just said to those thousand people,\n\n30:27.480 --> 30:30.800\n we'll give you a million dollars each to do this.\n\n30:30.800 --> 30:33.480\n Okay, there's your billion dollars.\n\n30:33.480 --> 30:35.080\n We're printing trillions of dollars of money\n\n30:35.080 --> 30:35.920\n to deal with this.\n\n30:35.920 --> 30:37.800\n If we had just done a thousand people\n\n30:37.800 --> 30:40.880\n for a million dollars each to do a challenge trial\n\n30:40.880 --> 30:45.800\n in March, April, May, when they had the mRNA vaccines ready,\n\n30:45.800 --> 30:47.480\n we could have deployed the vaccines in the summer.\n\n30:47.480 --> 30:49.160\n We would have been done with this.\n\n30:49.160 --> 30:50.600\n We would have been over by now.\n\n30:50.600 --> 30:52.720\n So we get to challenge all of that thinking.\n\n30:52.720 --> 30:54.520\n I think that's what the great pause did.\n\n30:54.520 --> 30:57.240\n It's letting everybody challenge that thinking is,\n\n30:57.240 --> 30:58.640\n why do we have that rule?\n\n30:58.640 --> 31:01.600\n Okay, yeah, we don't want to have people,\n\n31:01.600 --> 31:03.840\n you know, like give up their organs for money.\n\n31:03.840 --> 31:05.520\n Like we obviously understand,\n\n31:05.520 --> 31:08.040\n but there's a reasonable discussion about,\n\n31:08.040 --> 31:10.640\n well, maybe there's a level of risk in a global pandemic.\n\n31:10.640 --> 31:12.640\n I mean, we fought the Nazis, right?\n\n31:12.640 --> 31:13.880\n We defeated the Nazis.\n\n31:13.880 --> 31:15.440\n That took a lot of deaths to do that,\n\n31:15.440 --> 31:17.920\n but we had to kill that evil.\n\n31:17.920 --> 31:20.760\n This is another evil, which we must fight.\n\n31:20.760 --> 31:22.720\n And it's going to result in,\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:24.840\n it's already resulting in thousands of people dying a day,\n\n31:24.840 --> 31:26.920\n but we could have actually stopped it earlier\n\n31:26.920 --> 31:28.840\n if we just had a reasonable discussion.\n\n31:28.840 --> 31:31.400\n This is why podcasting is our respect what you do.\n\n31:31.400 --> 31:34.200\n This is why intelligent people are so drawn to podcasts\n\n31:34.200 --> 31:36.840\n because you and I can expand on this\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:40.240\n and not cancel each other over this very suggestion.\n\n31:40.240 --> 31:41.360\n When I make this suggestion,\n\n31:41.360 --> 31:43.360\n are challenge trials reasonable or not?\n\n31:43.360 --> 31:45.080\n If I were to do that on Twitter, they'd be like,\n\n31:45.080 --> 31:49.600\n oh, Calacanis wants to give poor people coronavirus\n\n31:49.600 --> 31:50.520\n in order to save rich people.\n\n31:50.520 --> 31:52.960\n It's like, no, I didn't say that.\n\n31:52.960 --> 31:55.600\n But you and I could have a reasonable discussion\n\n31:55.600 --> 31:57.880\n about a challenge trial is something we should consider\n\n31:57.880 --> 32:00.280\n in a acute situation\n\n32:00.280 --> 32:02.440\n where millions of people are going to lose their lives.\n\n32:02.440 --> 32:05.160\n Right, so that's an example\n\n32:05.160 --> 32:07.920\n of capitalism competition working really well.\n\n32:07.920 --> 32:10.120\n There's one of the, to me, sad thing to see\n\n32:10.120 --> 32:11.880\n about coronavirus is that, for example,\n\n32:11.880 --> 32:16.480\n testing at scale should have, it seems obvious.\n\n32:16.480 --> 32:18.280\n I was a little clueless about it,\n\n32:18.280 --> 32:21.240\n but because I thought there's no way you can have\n\n32:21.240 --> 32:24.440\n like antigen tests at hundreds of millions,\n\n32:24.440 --> 32:26.880\n like order hundreds of millions of them and make them cheap.\n\n32:26.880 --> 32:28.720\n But actually I realized recently\n\n32:28.720 --> 32:31.240\n that there have been available since about like May.\n\n32:31.240 --> 32:32.560\n Yeah. You were able to.\n\n32:32.560 --> 32:34.920\n In Korea, in Finland, all over the place.\n\n32:34.920 --> 32:36.760\n You could have done mass manufacture.\n\n32:36.760 --> 32:40.280\n So there, there's a little bit of a failure\n\n32:40.280 --> 32:43.240\n of capitalism to step up.\n\n32:43.240 --> 32:45.120\n And I don't know if you agree with this,\n\n32:45.120 --> 32:47.480\n but it seems that the blame is to be placed\n\n32:47.480 --> 32:52.080\n at the regulators and the various institutions.\n\n32:52.080 --> 32:54.000\n Chrony capitalism in all likelihood\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:55.680\n is what stopped it here in America.\n\n32:55.680 --> 32:58.560\n I mean, I had friends who had imported them\n\n32:58.560 --> 33:01.000\n from other countries, the testing kits.\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.560\n And you've probably been to parties\n\n33:02.560 --> 33:04.160\n where people had these kinds of testing kits\n\n33:04.160 --> 33:06.200\n from other countries and we're sitting here\n\n33:06.200 --> 33:07.560\n and they're just approving them now.\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:11.440\n Really, in February, month 11 of the pandemic in America,\n\n33:11.440 --> 33:13.600\n we're gonna have testing online, really.\n\n33:13.600 --> 33:17.200\n I mean, even if these tests were 80% effective\n\n33:17.200 --> 33:20.440\n and they're 95% effective, mass producing them,\n\n33:20.440 --> 33:23.600\n we should have sent them in every postal,\n\n33:23.600 --> 33:27.640\n anybody with a post office box with a mailing address\n\n33:27.640 --> 33:29.320\n should have had 10 of them put in their mailing address\n\n33:29.320 --> 33:30.800\n just for free from the government.\n\n33:30.800 --> 33:32.360\n And then everybody would be testing\n\n33:32.360 --> 33:33.480\n and we would have contained it.\n\n33:33.480 --> 33:35.800\n We don't have test and trace here in the United States.\n\n33:35.800 --> 33:39.320\n Well, all the countries that are on the other side of COVID\n\n33:39.320 --> 33:42.320\n did it by having testing, tracing\n\n33:42.320 --> 33:44.400\n and closing their borders and masks.\n\n33:44.400 --> 33:46.280\n That's the combination that works.\n\n33:46.280 --> 33:48.600\n The problem with the coronavirus\n\n33:48.600 --> 33:51.000\n is while there's a lot of institutions\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:52.480\n did not behave their best,\n\n33:52.480 --> 33:54.920\n it's also the case that there's a lot of uncertainty.\n\n33:54.920 --> 33:57.480\n So I tend to give a little bit of a pass\n\n33:57.480 --> 34:00.520\n to everybody involved for the uncertainty.\n\n34:00.520 --> 34:02.120\n We were all.\n\n34:02.120 --> 34:03.760\n I give them that until June.\n\n34:03.760 --> 34:06.360\n I wonder how history will remember this whole period.\n\n34:06.360 --> 34:07.920\n I'd love to ask you,\n\n34:07.920 --> 34:10.600\n because you were an early investor in Robinhoods\n\n34:10.600 --> 34:14.600\n and you're in a very nice place\n\n34:14.600 --> 34:19.600\n of being a huge supporter of the sort of Wall Street bets\n\n34:19.880 --> 34:22.880\n kind of distributed power of the people.\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:27.320\n And at the same time, because of you being an investor,\n\n34:27.320 --> 34:31.000\n like intellectually giving a chance to Robinhood\n\n34:31.000 --> 34:33.640\n in this kind of chaotic time of conversations\n\n34:33.640 --> 34:36.320\n to think about like, well, what did they do right?\n\n34:36.320 --> 34:37.840\n What did they do wrong?\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:40.160\n So you have a kind of a balance view on the whole thing,\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:41.880\n which is really nice.\n\n34:41.880 --> 34:46.200\n We've talked about what Robinhood did right, I think.\n\n34:46.200 --> 34:51.200\n Can you sort of steel man at your mouth's argument\n\n34:51.400 --> 34:56.360\n of what Robinhood did wrong in the last few days?\n\n34:56.360 --> 34:59.080\n Yeah, I mean, communication is always\n\n34:59.080 --> 35:00.800\n the number one issue with these startups, right?\n\n35:00.800 --> 35:04.160\n And if you, you have to get ahead of any problem\n\n35:04.160 --> 35:07.000\n and you have to put all the bad news out immediately.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:09.240\n And in the case of Robinhood, it seems based on\n\n35:09.240 --> 35:11.920\n what has been in the papers and what Robinhood said publicly\n\n35:11.920 --> 35:14.320\n is that they had this kind of liquidity crisis, right?\n\n35:14.320 --> 35:17.960\n Where they were being, because of these exchanges telling\n\n35:17.960 --> 35:20.000\n them you have to put up this amount of money in collateral\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:22.800\n and them being pinned at number one in the app store.\n\n35:22.800 --> 35:25.760\n There were so many people trying to buy five shares\n\n35:25.760 --> 35:28.480\n of this stock, five shares of this meme stock\n\n35:28.480 --> 35:30.200\n that it kind of broke their system.\n\n35:30.200 --> 35:32.120\n And then the people who clear the trades for them,\n\n35:32.120 --> 35:33.920\n they said, you gotta put up a billion dollars,\n\n35:33.920 --> 35:35.040\n two billion dollars, three billion dollars.\n\n35:35.040 --> 35:36.720\n We can't do that overnight.\n\n35:36.720 --> 35:40.400\n And I think that they were in an uncomfortable situation\n\n35:40.400 --> 35:44.360\n of like going on TV and saying, we have a liquidity crisis.\n\n35:44.360 --> 35:46.640\n Like that could be like a run on the bag.\n\n35:46.640 --> 35:49.040\n Everybody then logs in at the same time to Robinhood\n\n35:49.040 --> 35:50.280\n and tries to sell every share they own\n\n35:50.280 --> 35:51.400\n because they're afraid that the whole thing's\n\n35:51.400 --> 35:52.240\n gonna collapse, right?\n\n35:52.240 --> 35:55.200\n So I think there was this kind of like black swan event\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:57.960\n and they probably didn't communicate it all that well.\n\n35:57.960 --> 36:00.280\n At the center of that, this is really interesting.\n\n36:00.280 --> 36:03.680\n Maybe you can comment on the nature of communication.\n\n36:03.680 --> 36:07.400\n Vlad, the CEO, the guy you met at the bar,\n\n36:07.400 --> 36:10.680\n was I think at the center of the communication, right?\n\n36:10.680 --> 36:13.280\n So Elon is an example of a guy who also is\n\n36:13.280 --> 36:14.560\n at the center of the communication\n\n36:14.560 --> 36:16.280\n for his particular set of companies.\n\n36:16.280 --> 36:19.220\n And that on Twitter seems to be a really powerful way\n\n36:19.220 --> 36:20.600\n to communicate.\n\n36:20.600 --> 36:23.160\n And there was something, this is me saying it,\n\n36:23.160 --> 36:26.800\n there was something about Vlad that sounded\n\n36:26.800 --> 36:28.640\n like he's hiding stuff.\n\n36:29.680 --> 36:32.720\n As opposed to Elon, it doesn't sound\n\n36:32.720 --> 36:33.880\n like he's hiding stuff.\n\n36:33.880 --> 36:36.480\n It could be the nature, the beat,\n\n36:36.480 --> 36:38.480\n the timing of the conversation.\n\n36:38.480 --> 36:40.220\n Same thing with Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n36:40.220 --> 36:42.480\n Mark Zuckerberg for some reason often sounds\n\n36:42.480 --> 36:43.920\n like he's hiding something.\n\n36:43.920 --> 36:47.560\n And then there's like Jack Dorsey is much less so.\n\n36:47.560 --> 36:49.920\n And I don't know what that is about the CEOs\n\n36:49.920 --> 36:51.880\n that makes you trust them and not.\n\n36:51.880 --> 36:56.880\n Might be the point in time, like in terms of escape velocity.\n\n36:57.080 --> 37:01.240\n There might be nondisclosures in place\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:03.360\n that we're not aware of where they're not allowed\n\n37:03.360 --> 37:04.680\n to talk about certain relationships.\n\n37:04.680 --> 37:05.520\n I see.\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:08.480\n And that results like in Vlad's case,\n\n37:08.480 --> 37:12.880\n and that results in you being like acting weird and nervous.\n\n37:12.880 --> 37:13.720\n Or nervous.\n\n37:13.720 --> 37:15.160\n Yeah, it could just be the person is nervous.\n\n37:15.160 --> 37:18.380\n So it's really hard to be building one of these companies\n\n37:18.380 --> 37:21.960\n and you're at scale and oh my Lord,\n\n37:21.960 --> 37:23.400\n the entire thing's coming apart\n\n37:23.400 --> 37:25.240\n and you're the most hated person for that day.\n\n37:25.240 --> 37:26.600\n You know how the rage cycle works\n\n37:26.600 --> 37:29.560\n and the media is just so crazy\n\n37:29.560 --> 37:31.360\n when they get their hooks into something.\n\n37:31.360 --> 37:32.440\n I saw it happen with Uber.\n\n37:32.440 --> 37:34.720\n We saw it happen with Facebook and even Tesla.\n\n37:34.720 --> 37:37.880\n There were times when people did stupid things\n\n37:37.880 --> 37:39.740\n with autopilot and it's like, okay,\n\n37:39.740 --> 37:42.920\n somebody is watching a movie and sleeping in their car\n\n37:42.920 --> 37:44.280\n or leaving the driver's seat\n\n37:44.280 --> 37:46.280\n against all the rules of autopilot\n\n37:46.280 --> 37:47.860\n and somehow Tesla's responsible for that.\n\n37:47.860 --> 37:49.960\n It's like we have people who stand on top\n\n37:49.960 --> 37:51.680\n of their motorcycles and drive down the road\n\n37:51.680 --> 37:53.280\n on a motorcycle.\n\n37:53.280 --> 37:56.280\n And we don't blame Yamaha or Harley Davidson\n\n37:56.280 --> 37:58.520\n for some idiot standing on the seat of their motorcycle\n\n37:58.520 --> 37:59.840\n on a highway going 60 miles an hour.\n\n37:59.840 --> 38:02.000\n We just say, that person's an idiot.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:04.140\n But when new technology comes out,\n\n38:04.140 --> 38:07.720\n we blame the technology, not the person operating it.\n\n38:07.720 --> 38:10.520\n And if you are going to operate,\n\n38:11.460 --> 38:13.040\n we basically vilify it and demonize it.\n\n38:13.040 --> 38:14.280\n I think that is part of it.\n\n38:14.280 --> 38:16.920\n Like when the person at, I remember Airbnb,\n\n38:16.920 --> 38:19.640\n we always thought, what if somebody trashes your apartment?\n\n38:19.640 --> 38:21.360\n And then sure enough, a bunch of meth heads\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:22.960\n rented this poor woman's apartment.\n\n38:22.960 --> 38:24.280\n She left all of her stuff in it.\n\n38:24.280 --> 38:27.080\n And then a bunch of meth heads had a drug party,\n\n38:27.080 --> 38:29.840\n destroyed her apartment, ripped up all her photos\n\n38:29.840 --> 38:31.320\n and went crazy.\n\n38:31.320 --> 38:32.360\n And we knew that day would happen,\n\n38:32.360 --> 38:33.320\n but nobody remembers it now.\n\n38:33.320 --> 38:36.440\n But it was the number one story on every news channel\n\n38:36.440 --> 38:38.480\n because wow, that's an exciting story.\n\n38:38.480 --> 38:40.240\n And I just thought to myself,\n\n38:40.240 --> 38:43.880\n I wonder if there are any parties in hotel rooms\n\n38:43.880 --> 38:45.040\n where the hotel room is being trashed\n\n38:45.040 --> 38:47.360\n and people are doing drugs and crazy things.\n\n38:47.360 --> 38:49.920\n It's like, yes, that's basically every hotel\n\n38:49.920 --> 38:52.240\n in Los Angeles right now is being destroyed\n\n38:52.240 --> 38:55.240\n by some rock band that's throwing a TV out the window.\n\n38:55.240 --> 38:58.160\n Like we expected in a hotel,\n\n38:58.160 --> 39:00.000\n we just didn't expect it in somebody's house with Airbnb.\n\n39:00.000 --> 39:02.040\n And then Airbnb created rules around,\n\n39:02.040 --> 39:05.360\n you can't rent an Airbnb for a party and they learn.\n\n39:05.360 --> 39:07.640\n So I think there's a learning curve with these companies\n\n39:07.640 --> 39:09.920\n and they do get to scale at a level\n\n39:09.920 --> 39:11.680\n that is unprecedented.\n\n39:11.680 --> 39:13.400\n It used to take decades for a company\n\n39:13.400 --> 39:15.200\n to become an international phenomenon.\n\n39:15.200 --> 39:17.480\n Now it happens in two, three, four years.\n\n39:17.480 --> 39:18.520\n I mean, look at Clubhouse.\n\n39:18.520 --> 39:22.080\n This thing went from being a private beta six months ago\n\n39:22.080 --> 39:24.320\n to being the number one app in Germany\n\n39:24.320 --> 39:26.320\n and in Japan and here.\n\n39:26.320 --> 39:28.000\n Like just like that, boom.\n\n39:28.000 --> 39:30.240\n And it's because there's an ecosystem\n\n39:30.240 --> 39:32.440\n that has never existed, the app store.\n\n39:32.440 --> 39:35.760\n Then there's payments online.\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:38.960\n And then everybody has a supercomputer in their pocket.\n\n39:38.960 --> 39:40.200\n The thing people got wrong\n\n39:40.200 --> 39:44.800\n about entrepreneurship technology and business\n\n39:44.800 --> 39:45.760\n over the last couple of decades\n\n39:45.760 --> 39:48.040\n was just how big the market was\n\n39:48.040 --> 39:53.040\n and then how quickly you could achieve relevancy\n\n39:53.360 --> 39:54.280\n in these markets.\n\n39:55.400 --> 39:58.000\n We thought the market was like the 60 million homes\n\n39:58.000 --> 39:58.920\n were broadband.\n\n39:58.920 --> 40:00.720\n And originally it was like maybe 10 or 20.\n\n40:00.720 --> 40:02.000\n Then it became 60 million.\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:02.840\n Then it was like, okay,\n\n40:02.840 --> 40:05.120\n well, how many hours are you at your desktop computer?\n\n40:05.120 --> 40:07.240\n Well, like probably at our computers for five hours a day,\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:10.480\n 10 hours a day at work, three hours a day on our own.\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:11.320\n And then it was like,\n\n40:11.320 --> 40:12.480\n yeah, nobody's on their desktop computer.\n\n40:12.480 --> 40:14.080\n Everybody's on their mobile phone.\n\n40:14.080 --> 40:15.480\n Oh, and by the way, they have it with them.\n\n40:15.480 --> 40:16.480\n So the people with mobile phones\n\n40:16.480 --> 40:20.160\n are now using this high speed device with an app store\n\n40:20.160 --> 40:21.960\n with their credit card in it.\n\n40:21.960 --> 40:23.360\n In the early days of the internet,\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:25.440\n people were scared to put their credit card on the internet.\n\n40:25.440 --> 40:27.200\n That was considered a really dumb thing to do.\n\n40:27.200 --> 40:28.360\n If you put your credit card on the internet,\n\n40:28.360 --> 40:30.320\n you're gonna lose all your money.\n\n40:30.320 --> 40:32.240\n They're gonna hack you or whatever.\n\n40:32.240 --> 40:34.960\n And now it's just amazing to me\n\n40:34.960 --> 40:37.120\n how quickly when a company hits,\n\n40:37.120 --> 40:39.560\n how quickly it can get to a million subscribers\n\n40:39.560 --> 40:42.160\n or 10 million or a billion users, right?\n\n40:42.160 --> 40:44.040\n And there's all these networks, like social networks\n\n40:44.040 --> 40:47.440\n that allow the spread of the viral spread\n\n40:47.440 --> 40:51.920\n of like a new startup, a new company, a new app\n\n40:51.920 --> 40:52.760\n to be announced.\n\n40:52.760 --> 40:53.760\n Anything.\n\n40:53.760 --> 40:55.680\n An idea, a podcast, right?\n\n40:55.680 --> 40:58.240\n A single thing, a single meme could change the world.\n\n40:58.240 --> 41:00.400\n Speaking of Clubhouse, I just wanna,\n\n41:00.400 --> 41:01.800\n we're saying so many interesting things,\n\n41:01.800 --> 41:04.960\n but there was a magical moment with Vlad and Elon\n\n41:04.960 --> 41:05.800\n on Clubhouse.\n\n41:05.800 --> 41:06.640\n I don't know if you got that.\n\n41:06.640 --> 41:07.480\n That was wild.\n\n41:07.480 --> 41:11.800\n Yes, is there, do you have thoughts about that interaction\n\n41:13.040 --> 41:17.080\n which felt like so many aspects of this whole situation\n\n41:17.080 --> 41:20.160\n feels like totally novel, surreal,\n\n41:20.160 --> 41:22.040\n like it's defining a new era.\n\n41:22.040 --> 41:23.080\n It is, yes.\n\n41:23.080 --> 41:25.960\n Like a billionaire, the richest human on earth\n\n41:25.960 --> 41:30.280\n is interviewing the person at the center\n\n41:30.280 --> 41:34.320\n of one of the most interesting mass scale\n\n41:34.320 --> 41:39.320\n like power battles in finance ever, perhaps.\n\n41:39.480 --> 41:43.760\n And by the way, seven movies have been sold two weeks.\n\n41:43.760 --> 41:46.160\n Just think about how fast things are moving, Lex.\n\n41:46.160 --> 41:48.280\n This thing happens.\n\n41:48.280 --> 41:51.400\n Like people had the idea to short the stock six months ago.\n\n41:51.400 --> 41:52.600\n They start doing their research.\n\n41:52.600 --> 41:53.440\n They build an army.\n\n41:53.440 --> 41:55.360\n They execute the trade.\n\n41:55.360 --> 41:57.080\n The system goes down.\n\n41:57.080 --> 42:00.560\n Robinhood raises $3.5 billion in four days.\n\n42:00.560 --> 42:03.200\n Elon is interviewing them on Clubhouse on Sunday\n\n42:03.200 --> 42:04.480\n after the Wednesday it happened.\n\n42:04.480 --> 42:08.040\n And now here we are, it's 10 days later.\n\n42:08.040 --> 42:12.040\n Doesn't it feel like it's been 10 months?\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:13.280\n It's been 10 days, Lex.\n\n42:13.280 --> 42:14.240\n It's been 10 days.\n\n42:14.240 --> 42:15.080\n 10 days.\n\n42:15.080 --> 42:16.320\n Plus, there's like a new president,\n\n42:16.320 --> 42:18.040\n all these things, and everyone forgot.\n\n42:18.040 --> 42:19.520\n Oh, and there was an insurrection.\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:21.840\n By the way, we also almost had a revolution at the Capitol\n\n42:21.840 --> 42:26.240\n where a bunch of crazy people who have guns\n\n42:26.240 --> 42:28.680\n and body armor, and then a bunch of them\n\n42:28.680 --> 42:32.840\n who are just yoloing in cosplay, took over the Capitol.\n\n42:32.840 --> 42:35.280\n Well, so, and the other more dramatic thing to me is.\n\n42:35.280 --> 42:36.240\n That was one month ago.\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:37.080\n That was one month.\n\n42:37.080 --> 42:39.920\n And the president of the United States got banned\n\n42:39.920 --> 42:42.400\n from every major social network,\n\n42:42.400 --> 42:47.120\n and which I think I'm still deeply troubled by\n\n42:47.120 --> 42:49.760\n is Parler being removed from AWS.\n\n42:49.760 --> 42:53.520\n That changed the way, that changed a lot of things.\n\n42:53.520 --> 42:56.400\n As somebody who's an aspiring entrepreneur,\n\n42:56.400 --> 42:58.240\n that changed the way I see the world.\n\n42:58.240 --> 43:00.920\n That little, maybe I'm being over dramatic, but.\n\n43:00.920 --> 43:01.760\n No, you're not.\n\n43:01.760 --> 43:03.840\n I think you're paranoid for a reason.\n\n43:03.840 --> 43:05.640\n You're paranoid for a very good reason,\n\n43:05.640 --> 43:08.880\n which is as big as these companies can become,\n\n43:08.880 --> 43:10.720\n they are beholden to the mob.\n\n43:10.720 --> 43:14.560\n And if the mob says, hey, this person needs to be canceled,\n\n43:14.560 --> 43:16.000\n they're going to get canceled\n\n43:16.000 --> 43:18.400\n because you can't lose your entire audience.\n\n43:18.400 --> 43:19.800\n You could lose your whole customer base,\n\n43:19.800 --> 43:21.640\n and you could lose all your employees.\n\n43:21.640 --> 43:24.160\n I think what's interesting about your fear\n\n43:24.160 --> 43:25.920\n about Parler and AWS taking off\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:27.960\n is we went from being like a social network,\n\n43:27.960 --> 43:30.600\n which is the software layer.\n\n43:30.600 --> 43:33.760\n And then we went to like the infrastructure layer,\n\n43:33.760 --> 43:36.200\n and they'll even go after like Cloudflare,\n\n43:36.200 --> 43:37.680\n which is a CDN provider, right?\n\n43:37.680 --> 43:39.200\n They're just like a plumbing,\n\n43:39.200 --> 43:41.640\n it's like sort of like the telephone.\n\n43:41.640 --> 43:44.720\n So we're basically holding everybody responsible\n\n43:44.720 --> 43:45.880\n on the whole chain of events here.\n\n43:45.880 --> 43:47.440\n And what that's going to do is,\n\n43:48.440 --> 43:50.040\n I'm not a huge believer in crypto,\n\n43:50.040 --> 43:52.080\n but distributed computing,\n\n43:52.080 --> 43:54.120\n where nobody in decentralized\n\n43:54.120 --> 43:58.320\n and distributed computing platforms and open standards,\n\n43:58.320 --> 43:59.800\n podcasting is an open standard,\n\n43:59.800 --> 44:01.880\n the web is an open standard, FTP was an open standard,\n\n44:01.880 --> 44:06.880\n but Twitter and Facebook are closed.\n\n44:07.080 --> 44:09.520\n And what's going to happen is we will see\n\n44:09.520 --> 44:12.480\n a group of individuals create peer to peer networks\n\n44:12.480 --> 44:15.120\n for social media, where nobody can control it.\n\n44:15.120 --> 44:16.920\n And the same for cloud computing,\n\n44:16.920 --> 44:21.920\n where there's a crypto project where everybody will,\n\n44:22.280 --> 44:24.080\n and I invested in a company that tried to do this\n\n44:24.080 --> 44:26.280\n and got sold and it didn't work out,\n\n44:26.280 --> 44:30.120\n but take your hard drive on your computer at home,\n\n44:30.120 --> 44:33.280\n you give a terabyte of your 10 terabyte drive\n\n44:33.280 --> 44:34.440\n over to the cloud,\n\n44:34.440 --> 44:36.000\n and then everybody else does their terabyte.\n\n44:36.000 --> 44:38.320\n And then all of a sudden you've got this virtual cloud\n\n44:38.320 --> 44:40.600\n and anybody can store stuff on it and it's all encrypted,\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:41.880\n and then nobody can stop it.\n\n44:41.880 --> 44:43.640\n And that could be tweets, it could be videos.\n\n44:43.640 --> 44:48.040\n And so this idea that YouTube will be able to tell people,\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:50.920\n to kick people off because they're skeptics of,\n\n44:50.920 --> 44:52.600\n I don't know, the pandemic or the vaccine,\n\n44:52.600 --> 44:55.720\n or they've, they'll make things\n\n44:55.720 --> 44:57.200\n that are more censorship resistant.\n\n44:57.200 --> 44:59.200\n I think that'll be the reaction to all of this.\n\n44:59.200 --> 45:00.600\n This is my question for you,\n\n45:00.600 --> 45:03.440\n going back to that crappy bar and people pitching you,\n\n45:03.440 --> 45:08.440\n is there, like with Clubhouse, do you see competitors,\n\n45:08.640 --> 45:11.200\n do you think it's possible that another,\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:13.920\n perhaps more decentralized or another kind\n\n45:13.920 --> 45:15.200\n of social media will emerge\n\n45:15.200 --> 45:17.800\n that will take on Twitter and Facebook\n\n45:17.800 --> 45:19.240\n and might be able to replace them?\n\n45:19.240 --> 45:22.840\n If you look at the whole landscape with Clubhouse\n\n45:22.840 --> 45:23.680\n and everything else,\n\n45:23.680 --> 45:26.440\n do you think some other company might emerge?\n\n45:26.440 --> 45:28.160\n There'll be 10 versions of Clubhouse.\n\n45:28.160 --> 45:29.320\n We looked at social networking.\n\n45:29.320 --> 45:31.800\n We thought Friendster was it.\n\n45:31.800 --> 45:33.000\n Like Friendster was so good,\n\n45:33.000 --> 45:33.960\n nobody would be able to compete with that.\n\n45:33.960 --> 45:35.200\n It was growing so quickly.\n\n45:35.200 --> 45:36.840\n And then MySpace was a juggernaut\n\n45:36.840 --> 45:38.440\n and they hit a hundred million in revenue\n\n45:38.440 --> 45:39.560\n and a hundred million users.\n\n45:39.560 --> 45:40.800\n And it was like, well, that's game over.\n\n45:40.800 --> 45:43.920\n And then Facebook and LinkedIn and Snapchat\n\n45:43.920 --> 45:46.360\n and FriendFeed and countless others.\n\n45:46.360 --> 45:50.480\n So there's usually 20 people who will win in a category\n\n45:50.480 --> 45:53.240\n and 80% of the category will be owned\n\n45:53.240 --> 45:55.000\n by the top two or three players.\n\n45:55.000 --> 45:57.320\n But will those players change, do you think?\n\n45:57.320 --> 45:58.160\n What's your sense of that?\n\n45:58.160 --> 45:59.000\n Oh yeah, for sure.\n\n45:59.000 --> 46:01.320\n I mean, if Facebook hadn't bought Instagram,\n\n46:01.320 --> 46:02.880\n it would be a company in decline right now.\n\n46:02.880 --> 46:04.200\n People would be shorting the stock, right?\n\n46:04.200 --> 46:07.000\n Facebook peaked and then was sort of heading down\n\n46:07.000 --> 46:09.200\n and Instagram saved them and WhatsApp saved them.\n\n46:09.200 --> 46:11.760\n So, you know, that's another kind of weird moment\n\n46:11.760 --> 46:13.600\n in history that they were able to accumulate\n\n46:13.600 --> 46:15.760\n that much power and consolidate that much power.\n\n46:15.760 --> 46:17.200\n Instagram should have never sold to them.\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:18.040\n That should have gone public.\n\n46:18.040 --> 46:20.080\n They had just raised money from Sequoia\n\n46:20.080 --> 46:23.680\n and they had raised $50 million at a $500 million valuation\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:24.760\n and they didn't need to sell.\n\n46:24.760 --> 46:27.040\n And that was a big mistake to sell.\n\n46:27.040 --> 46:27.880\n They should have kept going\n\n46:27.880 --> 46:29.520\n and they should have took on Facebook.\n\n46:29.520 --> 46:31.480\n And if Instagram was a standalone company right now,\n\n46:31.480 --> 46:35.040\n it'd be worth 500 million, 500 billion, yeah.\n\n46:35.040 --> 46:38.560\n Do you think Facebook might buy Clubhouse has been?\n\n46:38.560 --> 46:39.760\n Oh, they'll probably copy it.\n\n46:39.760 --> 46:42.800\n I mean, Zuckerberg has no moral compass\n\n46:42.800 --> 46:43.640\n or ethics or anything.\n\n46:43.640 --> 46:44.640\n I mean, he's a marauder.\n\n46:44.640 --> 46:48.400\n I mean, he basically copied Snapchat seven times.\n\n46:48.400 --> 46:50.440\n Like he did poke and he just kept trying\n\n46:50.440 --> 46:51.600\n and trying and trying.\n\n46:51.600 --> 46:53.800\n Part of the reason why the WhatsApp founders\n\n46:53.800 --> 46:54.920\n and the Instagram founders left\n\n46:54.920 --> 46:57.200\n is they found Zuckerberg so distasteful\n\n46:57.200 --> 46:59.640\n in terms of his ability to copy.\n\n46:59.640 --> 47:02.520\n What do you think makes a great leader in that sense?\n\n47:02.520 --> 47:05.520\n Because, okay, so when I look at Zuckerberg.\n\n47:05.520 --> 47:06.920\n He's a great executor.\n\n47:06.920 --> 47:07.760\n Is he a great executor?\n\n47:07.760 --> 47:09.040\n I don't think he's a great leader.\n\n47:09.040 --> 47:10.080\n I was bullish on,\n\n47:10.080 --> 47:13.360\n I was excited by Facebook in the very early days.\n\n47:13.360 --> 47:15.400\n I thought it was an exciting opportunity to connect people\n\n47:15.400 --> 47:18.680\n and stuff started going wrong in certain kinds of ways.\n\n47:18.680 --> 47:22.200\n And again, maybe it's our human nature,\n\n47:22.200 --> 47:25.240\n but I attribute a lot of that to the leadership.\n\n47:25.240 --> 47:26.200\n Absolutely.\n\n47:26.200 --> 47:29.000\n I mean, the guy started it because he was unable\n\n47:29.000 --> 47:31.280\n to ask girls if they were single and on a date.\n\n47:31.280 --> 47:32.120\n I mean, that was his explicit.\n\n47:32.120 --> 47:33.040\n That could be a good motivator.\n\n47:33.040 --> 47:33.880\n That could be a good motivator.\n\n47:33.880 --> 47:34.720\n Well, I mean, it does.\n\n47:34.720 --> 47:36.880\n I mean, listen, the motivation of 18, 19 year old men\n\n47:36.880 --> 47:39.600\n or his, yeah, pretty clear.\n\n47:39.600 --> 47:41.840\n He was just trying to, he had no game.\n\n47:41.840 --> 47:44.600\n He had no game and he needed to know who was single\n\n47:44.600 --> 47:48.080\n so he could at least have a shot at getting a date.\n\n47:48.080 --> 47:48.920\n It's a little creepy.\n\n47:48.920 --> 47:49.760\n A little creepy, yeah.\n\n47:49.760 --> 47:54.040\n He, I think, was so obsessed with engagement and winning.\n\n47:54.040 --> 47:56.280\n And he's kind of like one of those friends you have\n\n47:56.280 --> 47:58.160\n who's just really good at playing a video game,\n\n47:58.160 --> 48:00.200\n but maybe doesn't see the bigger picture in life.\n\n48:00.200 --> 48:02.720\n And I mean, there's a reason why everybody who worked\n\n48:02.720 --> 48:04.720\n for him hates him and doesn't talk to him anymore\n\n48:04.720 --> 48:06.040\n and then actively derides him.\n\n48:06.040 --> 48:10.680\n Like so many, the people who sold WhatsApp to him\n\n48:10.680 --> 48:13.320\n then backed other projects like Telegram\n\n48:13.320 --> 48:15.000\n and said horrible things about him on the way out.\n\n48:15.000 --> 48:16.680\n These are the people he made billionaires.\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:19.160\n And they really don't like him.\n\n48:19.160 --> 48:21.760\n So I think there is something that he does\n\n48:21.760 --> 48:23.400\n that does not breed loyalty,\n\n48:23.400 --> 48:25.560\n but he's very successful in his focus,\n\n48:25.560 --> 48:27.280\n which is growth is all that matters.\n\n48:27.280 --> 48:30.240\n He's a marauder and taking friction out of products\n\n48:30.240 --> 48:32.760\n and processes is the playbook of Silicon Valley\n\n48:32.760 --> 48:34.340\n for the last decade or two.\n\n48:34.340 --> 48:35.180\n So whatever the friction is.\n\n48:35.180 --> 48:36.520\n It's like poetry what you're saying right now.\n\n48:36.520 --> 48:37.800\n It's like you're speaking so fast\n\n48:37.800 --> 48:40.540\n that I almost forget that you're dropping bombs.\n\n48:40.540 --> 48:43.720\n But so removing the, removing friction.\n\n48:43.720 --> 48:45.440\n And you're saying Facebook is exceptionally good\n\n48:45.440 --> 48:46.940\n at removing friction. He was the best at it.\n\n48:46.940 --> 48:49.360\n I mean, at Uber, they were like,\n\n48:49.360 --> 48:50.720\n we're gonna take out tipping.\n\n48:50.720 --> 48:52.520\n We're gonna take out the need for you\n\n48:52.520 --> 48:54.520\n to take out your credit card and do payment.\n\n48:54.520 --> 48:56.260\n It's just gonna be in your wallet.\n\n48:56.260 --> 48:59.080\n You got picked up, you leave, that's it.\n\n48:59.080 --> 49:00.240\n And I was like, we should have tipping.\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:02.040\n And they're like, it adds a step.\n\n49:02.040 --> 49:03.800\n And we're trying to have no steps.\n\n49:03.800 --> 49:06.120\n You put your address in, you click the button\n\n49:06.120 --> 49:07.600\n and you do nothing else.\n\n49:07.600 --> 49:09.400\n And so we've been obsessed here in Silicon Valley\n\n49:09.400 --> 49:12.080\n is how many clicks can we take out of the process?\n\n49:12.080 --> 49:13.960\n I guess Amazon is incredible at that as well.\n\n49:13.960 --> 49:15.720\n Absolutely, one click was the start of it.\n\n49:15.720 --> 49:17.960\n And then you look at Clubhouse as an example,\n\n49:17.960 --> 49:19.800\n you open Clubhouse and you see rooms,\n\n49:19.800 --> 49:21.100\n you click on it, you're listening.\n\n49:21.100 --> 49:22.920\n So in one click, you're listening.\n\n49:22.920 --> 49:25.200\n And then in one click, if you raise your hand\n\n49:25.200 --> 49:27.920\n or you get invited and you say, yes, you're speaking.\n\n49:27.920 --> 49:31.280\n So it's two clicks to speak, one click to listen.\n\n49:31.280 --> 49:34.080\n I mean, the only way they could make that app work\n\n49:34.080 --> 49:35.620\n even faster is if you opened it up\n\n49:35.620 --> 49:37.740\n and your microphone was turned on,\n\n49:37.740 --> 49:41.800\n which is kind of scary, but that is the next evolution.\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:43.920\n And what happens when you go that fast\n\n49:43.920 --> 49:46.000\n is you get unintended consequences.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:48.280\n And so this is why Facebook has had more fines\n\n49:48.280 --> 49:49.880\n than any company in the history of Silicon Valley,\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:52.160\n just giant fines for doing stuff like this.\n\n49:52.160 --> 49:54.300\n And one of them was, I don't know if you remember\n\n49:54.300 --> 49:55.320\n when they created groups\n\n49:55.320 --> 49:57.360\n or if you have a group for your podcast,\n\n49:57.360 --> 49:59.480\n but you can just add people to a group\n\n49:59.480 --> 50:01.280\n without their permission.\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:02.520\n And there was this famous case\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:04.800\n when they first came out with it.\n\n50:04.800 --> 50:07.760\n Somebody created a Nambla fake group,\n\n50:07.760 --> 50:10.120\n National Man Love Boy Association or whatever,\n\n50:10.120 --> 50:12.080\n like pedophilia association.\n\n50:12.080 --> 50:14.440\n And they added Zuckerberg, Mike Arrington, myself,\n\n50:14.440 --> 50:17.200\n and like 20 other famous people in Silicon Valley.\n\n50:17.200 --> 50:19.200\n And I was like, and then somebody takes a screenshot of it\n\n50:19.200 --> 50:20.240\n and they're like, you're in Nambla?\n\n50:20.240 --> 50:21.600\n And I'm like, no.\n\n50:22.840 --> 50:25.080\n Facebook, and then Zuckerberg's response was,\n\n50:25.080 --> 50:26.960\n well, if your friends put you in that Nambla group,\n\n50:26.960 --> 50:27.800\n you should get new friends.\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:29.600\n And it was like, you got put in there too.\n\n50:29.600 --> 50:33.480\n And then the sad part about it was\n\n50:33.480 --> 50:35.560\n there were a group of young men who were gay\n\n50:35.560 --> 50:36.560\n and who were in college\n\n50:36.560 --> 50:38.520\n and there was a gay choir in their college\n\n50:38.520 --> 50:41.640\n and the person who was coordinating their Facebook group\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:42.760\n added them.\n\n50:42.760 --> 50:44.760\n So Zuckerberg, it wasn't enough for Zuckerberg\n\n50:44.760 --> 50:48.040\n to make it so anybody could add anybody to any group\n\n50:48.040 --> 50:49.680\n because it will grow faster,\n\n50:49.680 --> 50:50.840\n let alone you have to confirm\n\n50:50.840 --> 50:52.560\n you wanna be added to the group.\n\n50:52.560 --> 50:54.720\n What it also did was posted it on their walls\n\n50:54.720 --> 50:56.720\n to increase engagement.\n\n50:56.720 --> 50:58.680\n And what they inadvertently did was\n\n50:58.680 --> 51:01.120\n they outed a bunch of 18, 19 year olds in college\n\n51:01.120 --> 51:02.000\n to their families\n\n51:03.120 --> 51:06.480\n because they joined the gay men's choir at some college.\n\n51:06.480 --> 51:08.720\n And this is the kind of way,\n\n51:08.720 --> 51:11.080\n this is where Silicon Valley needs to check itself\n\n51:11.080 --> 51:14.720\n and to do better is you have to really think,\n\n51:14.720 --> 51:16.880\n well, there is my incentive to grow faster\n\n51:16.880 --> 51:18.520\n and then there's what's right for society\n\n51:18.520 --> 51:19.360\n and for the individual.\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:21.960\n You gotta think it through, think it through.\n\n51:21.960 --> 51:23.800\n It's sometimes very difficult.\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:25.560\n This is where vision is required\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:28.680\n to anticipate the unintended consequences.\n\n51:28.680 --> 51:33.000\n And it seems like Mark Zuckerberg is not very good at that.\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:37.200\n You've talked to so many great leaders in this world,\n\n51:37.200 --> 51:39.360\n privately and publicly.\n\n51:39.360 --> 51:42.400\n What do you think makes a great leader\n\n51:42.400 --> 51:44.480\n of these tech companies?\n\n51:44.480 --> 51:45.320\n Do you have an example?\n\n51:45.320 --> 51:47.360\n Is Elon to you a great leader?\n\n51:47.360 --> 51:49.200\n He's also a controversial one, right?\n\n51:49.200 --> 51:52.440\n There's a love and hate, a controversial sense\n\n51:52.440 --> 51:56.040\n that there is, and I know a lot of people work with him,\n\n51:56.040 --> 52:00.280\n for him, that there's also a love, hate relationship.\n\n52:00.280 --> 52:01.680\n The hate comes from the fact\n\n52:01.680 --> 52:04.640\n that they get pushed extremely hard.\n\n52:04.640 --> 52:07.560\n It's a very competitive environment,\n\n52:07.560 --> 52:10.120\n but it's a positive one\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:12.880\n because there's a vision that's underlying.\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:15.040\n It's similar to the Steve Jobs thing.\n\n52:15.040 --> 52:17.080\n And it has to do with the,\n\n52:17.080 --> 52:19.880\n back to our Michael Jordan discussion as well,\n\n52:19.880 --> 52:23.280\n that there seems to be the demons involved in tension\n\n52:23.280 --> 52:27.840\n and just anxiety, all those kinds of things.\n\n52:27.840 --> 52:30.080\n If you wanna do great things,\n\n52:30.080 --> 52:31.440\n there will be some suffering\n\n52:32.320 --> 52:34.600\n and there'll be some pain,\n\n52:34.600 --> 52:37.000\n and it's not easy if you wanna change the world.\n\n52:37.000 --> 52:39.000\n And then some people have this expectation\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.200\n that it's going to be easy.\n\n52:41.200 --> 52:44.640\n And what you'll typically find for any great leader\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:47.160\n who's trying to do something super ambitious,\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:48.600\n like if you wanna be like,\n\n52:48.600 --> 52:50.760\n if you're a rich guy and you start a restaurant\n\n52:50.760 --> 52:52.080\n and you don't care about making money\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:54.240\n and people have made restaurants before,\n\n52:54.240 --> 52:55.160\n you could be high fives\n\n52:55.160 --> 52:56.880\n and everybody could love you or whatever.\n\n52:56.880 --> 52:58.800\n But if you wanna change the world,\n\n52:58.800 --> 52:59.880\n you wanna do something hard driving,\n\n52:59.880 --> 53:01.440\n there's gonna be sacrifice involved.\n\n53:01.440 --> 53:05.360\n And so the problem is people are looking at something\n\n53:05.360 --> 53:08.080\n that is an Olympic caliber sport\n\n53:08.080 --> 53:10.560\n or a Navy SEALs like effort.\n\n53:10.560 --> 53:13.680\n In other words, an effort that requires massive sacrifice.\n\n53:13.680 --> 53:16.040\n We would not look at somebody who wins a gold medal,\n\n53:16.040 --> 53:17.360\n like Michael Phelps and say,\n\n53:17.360 --> 53:20.040\n oh my God, he had to get up at 4 a.m. every day\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:22.320\n and he had to swim and he had to do an ice bath.\n\n53:22.320 --> 53:25.720\n Oh my God, that poor guy, he suffered, he was tortured.\n\n53:25.720 --> 53:27.640\n People were super mean to him,\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:28.480\n they put him in an ice bath.\n\n53:28.480 --> 53:30.280\n It was like, no, he wanted to be\n\n53:30.280 --> 53:32.080\n the greatest swimmer of all time\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:34.080\n and he knew what the sacrifice entailed.\n\n53:34.080 --> 53:37.120\n And that what happens in work, in business,\n\n53:37.120 --> 53:39.280\n is that people conflate like,\n\n53:39.280 --> 53:43.000\n oh, well, I went to work to make a living to pay my bills\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:47.600\n versus Michael Phelps approach to getting gold medals\n\n53:47.600 --> 53:49.600\n or Michael Jordan or pick the person,\n\n53:49.600 --> 53:50.840\n Elon or Jeff Bezos.\n\n53:50.840 --> 53:54.080\n And when you look at the reviews of like a place like Amazon,\n\n53:54.080 --> 53:56.280\n there was this incredible story in the New York Times\n\n53:56.280 --> 53:58.760\n where people were, I don't know if you remember it,\n\n53:58.760 --> 54:01.400\n this is the worst place you could ever work, Amazon.\n\n54:01.400 --> 54:04.560\n And we talked to 200 people and they all told us,\n\n54:04.560 --> 54:07.080\n they all described for us in the New York Times,\n\n54:07.080 --> 54:10.120\n a culture of cutthroatness and brutality\n\n54:10.120 --> 54:11.840\n that has never before been seen.\n\n54:11.840 --> 54:13.800\n And then you see all these people who work for Bezos\n\n54:13.800 --> 54:16.360\n for 24 years from when they graduated\n\n54:16.360 --> 54:18.280\n with their MBAs until today.\n\n54:18.280 --> 54:19.880\n And they've never left the company\n\n54:19.880 --> 54:23.520\n and they are ride or die forever.\n\n54:23.520 --> 54:26.200\n And what you're seeing there is,\n\n54:26.200 --> 54:29.200\n there's a mismatch of people going to work\n\n54:29.200 --> 54:32.720\n in an extreme sport or an extreme endeavor\n\n54:32.720 --> 54:34.280\n who should not do that.\n\n54:34.280 --> 54:37.920\n There are people who should go out into the rice fields\n\n54:37.920 --> 54:39.000\n and pick rice.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:42.400\n And then there's another group of people who are samurai\n\n54:42.400 --> 54:46.360\n and who wield a sword and who take on missions\n\n54:46.360 --> 54:48.240\n that are dangerous.\n\n54:48.240 --> 54:50.560\n But if you're a rice picker and that's what you do\n\n54:50.560 --> 54:53.920\n and you feel safe, just getting a couple grains of rice,\n\n54:53.920 --> 54:56.560\n put them in a basket, cleaning it and then whatever,\n\n54:56.560 --> 54:58.520\n that's valid work, no big deal.\n\n54:58.520 --> 55:00.120\n I'm not deriding it, I'm sort of,\n\n55:00.120 --> 55:02.200\n but that is one group.\n\n55:02.200 --> 55:03.800\n And then there's people who are samurai\n\n55:03.800 --> 55:05.880\n and you cannot conflate the two,\n\n55:05.880 --> 55:07.960\n you cannot compare the two.\n\n55:07.960 --> 55:10.560\n And that's what is happening right now in business.\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:12.160\n Whenever you see these stories about,\n\n55:12.160 --> 55:14.640\n this person at this company is like a tyrant\n\n55:14.640 --> 55:17.080\n and they're so horrible and they yelled at somebody.\n\n55:17.080 --> 55:19.120\n Like if you're in the field\n\n55:19.120 --> 55:22.080\n and you're taking the beach at Normandy and it's D day\n\n55:22.080 --> 55:23.720\n or you gotta take the hill\n\n55:23.720 --> 55:25.640\n or you gotta whack Osama bin Laden\n\n55:25.640 --> 55:27.800\n and you're the Navy SEALs and like a rudder,\n\n55:27.800 --> 55:31.320\n a rotor gets knocked off the back of the Black Hawk,\n\n55:31.320 --> 55:32.800\n like this is serious shit.\n\n55:32.800 --> 55:35.360\n Like don't do it if you're not serious.\n\n55:35.360 --> 55:37.520\n And if you're not serious about changing the world,\n\n55:37.520 --> 55:39.320\n why would you go work for Bezos?\n\n55:39.320 --> 55:40.720\n Why would you go work for Elon Musk?\n\n55:40.720 --> 55:43.520\n Don't do it, don't go work there.\n\n55:43.520 --> 55:46.080\n This is, let me just sit back\n\n55:46.080 --> 55:49.800\n and enjoy the beauty of all of that.\n\n55:49.800 --> 55:50.840\n That's music to my ears,\n\n55:50.840 --> 55:52.480\n but I'm not sure what to do with it\n\n55:52.480 --> 55:57.480\n because it's conflicting to a lot of the things I hear\n\n55:57.600 --> 56:00.080\n from the way you're supposed to kind of act.\n\n56:00.080 --> 56:03.680\n And I think in order to do great things,\n\n56:03.680 --> 56:06.720\n you have to, I always admired people\n\n56:06.720 --> 56:08.400\n that lose their shit a little bit\n\n56:08.400 --> 56:10.160\n because they're so passionate.\n\n56:10.160 --> 56:14.320\n And I apologize and all those kinds of things,\n\n56:14.320 --> 56:15.760\n but like there's a tension,\n\n56:15.760 --> 56:18.600\n there's a drama to the creative process\n\n56:18.600 --> 56:20.720\n when especially in the early startup,\n\n56:22.720 --> 56:26.320\n this is not like the work life balance idea\n\n56:26.320 --> 56:27.160\n doesn't even apply.\n\n56:27.160 --> 56:28.680\n Work life balance, it's ridiculous.\n\n56:28.680 --> 56:30.640\n It's a ridiculous concept.\n\n56:30.640 --> 56:33.200\n Like the idea that there's like work life balance\n\n56:33.200 --> 56:34.480\n in a startup is ridiculous.\n\n56:34.480 --> 56:36.560\n If you're looking for work life balance,\n\n56:36.560 --> 56:39.600\n do not go to a startup or any kind of ambitious company.\n\n56:39.600 --> 56:43.200\n There is a series of places you can work in the world\n\n56:43.200 --> 56:46.840\n where you do not need to do anything more\n\n56:46.840 --> 56:48.320\n than what's put in front of you.\n\n56:48.320 --> 56:52.240\n And you just put the round peg in the round hole\n\n56:52.240 --> 56:55.600\n and the square peg in the square hole and you go home.\n\n56:55.600 --> 57:00.600\n And you get your little bits and grains of rice\n\n57:00.920 --> 57:03.200\n and you go heat them up and eat them, that's it.\n\n57:03.200 --> 57:04.280\n And then there's this other thing,\n\n57:04.280 --> 57:07.520\n which is the extreme pursuit of changing the world\n\n57:07.520 --> 57:09.000\n and sacrificing.\n\n57:09.000 --> 57:11.160\n And we have a generation of people,\n\n57:11.160 --> 57:14.200\n multi generations of people who are soft.\n\n57:14.200 --> 57:15.040\n They're just soft.\n\n57:15.040 --> 57:17.720\n I mean, what is the big struggle we've had to deal with\n\n57:17.720 --> 57:19.440\n in America in our lifetimes?\n\n57:19.440 --> 57:21.640\n Like 9 11 and we didn't have the Vietnam War\n\n57:21.640 --> 57:23.400\n and then we had this like weird Iraq Wars\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:26.640\n and Middle East Wars that were kind of like a small number\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:27.920\n of people went and we sent drones.\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:30.360\n Like we have not had to sacrifice.\n\n57:30.360 --> 57:33.240\n Gen Xers, maybe the tail end of boomers\n\n57:33.240 --> 57:35.640\n experienced the Vietnam War regrettably.\n\n57:35.640 --> 57:38.840\n But we've had a couple of generations now, three I guess,\n\n57:38.840 --> 57:40.600\n that just haven't had to suffer.\n\n57:40.600 --> 57:42.680\n And so we're soft as Americans, we're soft.\n\n57:42.680 --> 57:44.720\n And then you look at people in China and we're like,\n\n57:44.720 --> 57:46.960\n oh my God, these poor Chinese people are living\n\n57:46.960 --> 57:48.440\n in these tiny cramped apartments.\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:52.600\n Like they were living in like essentially lean twos\n\n57:52.600 --> 57:56.120\n in Northern China with no running water\n\n57:56.120 --> 57:58.480\n or like one spigot of ice cold water for the entire village.\n\n57:58.480 --> 58:01.960\n Like they're thrilled to be joining the middle class.\n\n58:01.960 --> 58:04.480\n Even if it's the bottom of the middle class, right?\n\n58:04.480 --> 58:06.400\n They've taken hundreds of millions of people in China\n\n58:06.400 --> 58:08.560\n and moved them into the middle class.\n\n58:08.560 --> 58:10.280\n And we're like, oh my God, these people are suffering.\n\n58:10.280 --> 58:12.360\n It's like, they're up to $4 an hour,\n\n58:12.360 --> 58:14.480\n three or $4 an hour in the factories there.\n\n58:14.480 --> 58:17.920\n And they were just two decades ago at,\n\n58:17.920 --> 58:20.880\n I don't know, it was probably 50 cents an hour,\n\n58:20.880 --> 58:22.360\n something crazy like that.\n\n58:22.360 --> 58:26.280\n And now they've improved the quality of life there so much,\n\n58:26.280 --> 58:28.960\n just like America did 200 years ago or 100 years ago.\n\n58:28.960 --> 58:31.200\n They've improved it so much in China\n\n58:31.200 --> 58:33.440\n that now they're getting outpriced for factories\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:36.960\n from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India,\n\n58:36.960 --> 58:39.080\n and people are moving and people in China\n\n58:39.080 --> 58:43.080\n are moving the factories out of China into other countries.\n\n58:43.080 --> 58:46.120\n Because the Chinese are now outsourcing to Vietnam\n\n58:46.120 --> 58:46.960\n and other countries.\n\n58:46.960 --> 58:48.840\n So this is the way of the world.\n\n58:48.840 --> 58:51.080\n People move up and they get a better lot in life\n\n58:51.080 --> 58:51.920\n for their families.\n\n58:51.920 --> 58:53.480\n And just in America, we've gotten soft.\n\n58:53.480 --> 58:55.400\n And there's a generation.\n\n58:55.400 --> 58:57.040\n How do people die in America now?\n\n58:57.040 --> 59:01.400\n Suicide, obesity, heart attacks, anxiety.\n\n59:01.400 --> 59:04.160\n I mean, we're suffering from things\n\n59:04.160 --> 59:05.920\n that if you told people 100 years ago\n\n59:05.920 --> 59:09.200\n that the number, the top ways Americans would die\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:11.840\n would be overeating and suicide,\n\n59:11.840 --> 59:13.520\n they'd be like, what?\n\n59:13.520 --> 59:14.640\n You're literally killing yourself\n\n59:14.640 --> 59:15.600\n or eating yourself to death?\n\n59:15.600 --> 59:16.960\n That's what's happening in America?\n\n59:16.960 --> 59:20.480\n And when everybody, not everybody en masse,\n\n59:20.480 --> 59:21.640\n there's a large number of people\n\n59:21.640 --> 59:23.920\n who have become softer and softer.\n\n59:23.920 --> 59:25.480\n Capitalism creates an environment\n\n59:25.480 --> 59:28.360\n where there is people that still step up amidst that\n\n59:28.360 --> 59:31.400\n with a big dream and challenge the conventions.\n\n59:31.400 --> 59:33.560\n And that human spirit just arise above that.\n\n59:33.560 --> 59:36.320\n Elon's example of that, Jeff Bezos's example of that.\n\n59:36.320 --> 59:37.640\n Countless, countless examples.\n\n59:37.640 --> 59:42.520\n And they push the limits of those,\n\n59:42.520 --> 59:45.240\n of human beings that are willing to step up.\n\n59:45.240 --> 59:49.840\n And I think about sort of how to create a company\n\n59:49.840 --> 59:54.200\n that amidst all of this softness\n\n59:54.200 --> 59:56.080\n still creates a revolution.\n\n59:56.080 --> 59:58.440\n It's not, it doesn't seem trivial.\n\n59:58.440 --> 1:00:00.440\n It seems like how do you build a culture\n\n1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:05.440\n that's once healthy, but also unhealthy\n\n1:00:06.840 --> 1:00:09.040\n in the way that an Olympic pursuit is.\n\n1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:10.480\n It's all top down.\n\n1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:12.840\n Everybody just, you asked earlier what leadership was\n\n1:00:12.840 --> 1:00:13.800\n and I never answered the question.\n\n1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:16.400\n I think what leaders do is they set the example,\n\n1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:17.680\n they set the bar.\n\n1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:19.920\n And if you look at someone like Elon,\n\n1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.400\n we're personal friends for 20 years\n\n1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:24.680\n and he is indefatigable.\n\n1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:29.000\n Like, I mean, the guy has a stamina that is just phenomenal.\n\n1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:30.400\n Like he does not get tired.\n\n1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.200\n He works relentlessly\n\n1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:36.000\n and he sets that standard for the rest of the team.\n\n1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.800\n And I think Bezos is very sharp\n\n1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:41.520\n and likes to debate stuff and is very,\n\n1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:44.400\n and Jobs was just incredible at design\n\n1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:46.080\n and figuring out how to bridge that gap.\n\n1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:48.880\n So they just, leaders set the standard.\n\n1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.200\n They set the standard.\n\n1:00:50.200 --> 1:00:52.360\n And you know that your time is over as a leader\n\n1:00:52.360 --> 1:00:53.800\n when you can't set the standard.\n\n1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:55.720\n And that's when you have to pass the baton, right?\n\n1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.160\n And Bezos did that.\n\n1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:58.880\n And Bezos now is saying, you know what?\n\n1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:01.600\n I'm 57, I'm the richest guy on the planet,\n\n1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:03.920\n depending on the week.\n\n1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:06.560\n And I would like to do some other challenges,\n\n1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.840\n but I don't wanna grind it out at Amazon\n\n1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.280\n for another 25 years.\n\n1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.360\n I wanna do other things.\n\n1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:13.040\n And so he passed the baton.\n\n1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:15.320\n And that's the healthy thing to do in that regard.\n\n1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.160\n I do think there is a time period\n\n1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:18.840\n in which you can run that hot.\n\n1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.600\n And then at a certain point you have to then change.\n\n1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:24.360\n Just like an athlete might go to be a coach, right?\n\n1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:25.600\n Or a commentator.\n\n1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:29.440\n And so being an entrepreneur is brutal.\n\n1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:31.920\n It's seven days a week, 12 hours a day.\n\n1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.320\n Anybody who says anything differently\n\n1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:34.640\n is kidding themselves.\n\n1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:36.560\n You're gonna have to sacrifice.\n\n1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:39.960\n And this competition, and America has to fight.\n\n1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:43.840\n If America does not win capitalism, and China does,\n\n1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:47.880\n it is literally the end of the human species.\n\n1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:49.680\n It's over for humanity.\n\n1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:52.640\n Right now, everything has been going really well\n\n1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.680\n in terms of the number of people living in poverty\n\n1:01:54.680 --> 1:01:55.920\n is plummeting.\n\n1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:59.160\n Lifespans have been rising.\n\n1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:01.120\n Science is booming.\n\n1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.080\n The economy is booming.\n\n1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:02.920\n All these things are incredible.\n\n1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:05.080\n The one thing that's kind of stagnant right now\n\n1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:07.080\n is the number of people living in democracy\n\n1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:09.480\n versus under authoritarian rule.\n\n1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:10.320\n It's flat.\n\n1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:11.920\n So when you look at all Steve Pinker's charts,\n\n1:02:11.920 --> 1:02:13.400\n and he's really excited,\n\n1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:15.040\n there's one you're gonna see that's flat.\n\n1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:18.480\n And I think we peaked with 53 or 54% of people\n\n1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.320\n on the planet Earth being in a democracy,\n\n1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:22.480\n and now it's going below 50.\n\n1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.120\n And it's because some of the democratic Western countries\n\n1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:27.400\n don't have the population growth\n\n1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:30.280\n of some of the communist and socialist countries\n\n1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:31.600\n and authoritarian countries.\n\n1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:35.960\n And we have to make sure that we win capitalism.\n\n1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:38.160\n We must win economically.\n\n1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:39.520\n That is the battlefield.\n\n1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:41.920\n The battlefield is science, technology, and money,\n\n1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.320\n and economy, finance.\n\n1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:44.600\n That's the battlefield.\n\n1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:47.440\n China wins, authoritarians win.\n\n1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:51.320\n And at any time, Xi Jinping can pull Jack Ma into a room\n\n1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.280\n and say, it's time for you to be reeducated.\n\n1:02:54.280 --> 1:02:56.320\n Or they can put three or four million people,\n\n1:02:56.320 --> 1:02:59.160\n Uighurs, into prison camps and say, you know what?\n\n1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:00.720\n This religious thing,\n\n1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:03.600\n that's counter to what is productive for us.\n\n1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:05.480\n Therefore, we're gonna shave your heads\n\n1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:06.480\n and we're going to have you\n\n1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:08.200\n literally pick cotton in the fields.\n\n1:03:08.200 --> 1:03:12.880\n They have Uighurs with no sense of any kind of\n\n1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:15.720\n arc of history in the fields picking cottons\n\n1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:19.160\n as slaves in what can only be described\n\n1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:22.280\n by every humanitarian organization as a concentration camp.\n\n1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:24.680\n And every Jewish person I know takes great offense\n\n1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:27.240\n when somebody uses the Holocaust as a metaphor,\n\n1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:29.480\n except in the case of the Uighurs right now.\n\n1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:32.320\n And every Jewish person I've talked to has said to me,\n\n1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:33.480\n that is a Holocaust.\n\n1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:37.080\n That is millions of people going to genocide\n\n1:03:37.080 --> 1:03:38.640\n because of their religious beliefs.\n\n1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:40.120\n And I'm an atheist,\n\n1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:43.120\n but if people wanna believe a certain religion, fine.\n\n1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:47.160\n But China's approach is we need to win capitalism so bad,\n\n1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:49.520\n we need to win on the global stage so bad,\n\n1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:52.520\n we can't have any of this religious stuff going on here.\n\n1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:55.400\n That is a distraction from winning and beating America.\n\n1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:56.640\n And then in America,\n\n1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:59.040\n the people who are gonna make us win are the entrepreneurs\n\n1:03:59.040 --> 1:04:00.520\n and the scientists and the technology\n\n1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.320\n and our education system and finance.\n\n1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:04.120\n And we're vilifying those things.\n\n1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:05.440\n It's pretty dark.\n\n1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:09.120\n It's dark, but I still believe that the vilification\n\n1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.440\n is just in the space of Twitter and the space of ideas.\n\n1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.280\n I think that's probably a good.\n\n1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:14.520\n And entrepreneurs win out in the end.\n\n1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:15.360\n They don't listen to that.\n\n1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:16.200\n I believe we'll win.\n\n1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.720\n And they'll build, we'll get the rocks up.\n\n1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:19.640\n Some of them do actually in their darkest moments,\n\n1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:21.600\n I can tell you that they turn off their Twitter accounts\n\n1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:23.240\n and they, I've had to sit down\n\n1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:26.560\n with a number of entrepreneurs and say, turn off Twitter.\n\n1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:28.360\n This is not healthy for you.\n\n1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:30.320\n This is not a healthy pursuit because,\n\n1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:31.280\n don't read the comments.\n\n1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.080\n If you do, it's like a full contact sport.\n\n1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:35.640\n You should just take it as like professional wrestling\n\n1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:38.840\n or something, but stay focused on building companies\n\n1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:41.800\n and advancing the human species\n\n1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:43.120\n through science and technology.\n\n1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:43.960\n I mean.\n\n1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:47.040\n As you're describing, you've hosted this week in startups\n\n1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:49.360\n for how many episodes?\n\n1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:51.160\n 11 years, almost 1200 now.\n\n1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:52.120\n 1200.\n\n1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:52.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.480\n So you've talked to some of the great leaders\n\n1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:56.240\n in business in general.\n\n1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:01.240\n Is there a common thing that you see or?\n\n1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:03.920\n Really, I'm in a relationship with their parents.\n\n1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:06.440\n Like just find me a great entrepreneur.\n\n1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:08.480\n I will, show me the trauma.\n\n1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:10.760\n Their dad was like, you're not good enough.\n\n1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:14.280\n In the teenage years, is that truly, is there something?\n\n1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:15.640\n There is definitely something.\n\n1:05:15.640 --> 1:05:18.080\n Hardship at some point in their life kind of thing?\n\n1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:18.920\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n1:05:18.920 --> 1:05:20.960\n I mean, and there's definitely something\n\n1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:24.440\n with immigrant parents that is a bit of a stereotype\n\n1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:26.280\n out here, but I've heard from many investors,\n\n1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:29.520\n like that's like their, oh, were your parents immigrants?\n\n1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:32.480\n And did they beat into you that you have to succeed\n\n1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.240\n and you feel the need to succeed\n\n1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:35.960\n because they suffered to get you to this country?\n\n1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:38.840\n Like there is an archetype there that I hear.\n\n1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:40.840\n When I started investing, I heard from a lot of people.\n\n1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:43.080\n It's like, yeah, you wanna find those immigrant founders\n\n1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:44.120\n who are coming out of Stanford\n\n1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:45.840\n because they had to fight to get there\n\n1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:47.960\n and their parents had to fight, right?\n\n1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:50.520\n So it was like two huge fights and there's so much at stake\n\n1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.400\n as opposed to somebody who's fifth generation\n\n1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:54.080\n and like had everything handed to them\n\n1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.960\n and they were legacy and got into schools for free.\n\n1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:59.960\n But I think in general, the ability to get people\n\n1:05:59.960 --> 1:06:03.080\n to join you on that journey is so critical.\n\n1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:05.280\n So you have to be charismatic\n\n1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:07.320\n and it doesn't mean like you're an extrovert.\n\n1:06:07.320 --> 1:06:10.640\n There are introverts who are super charismatic\n\n1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:11.600\n and there are soft spoken people.\n\n1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:14.120\n They don't have to be like super vivacious\n\n1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:16.600\n or rambunctious people.\n\n1:06:16.600 --> 1:06:18.080\n They could be just quiet assassins,\n\n1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:19.880\n but you need to be able to get people\n\n1:06:19.880 --> 1:06:21.000\n to come on the journey with you.\n\n1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.720\n You have to be that storyteller\n\n1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:23.840\n and you have to have that passion\n\n1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:26.760\n and then you have to transfer that enthusiasm to investors,\n\n1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:29.960\n the press, to customers, to all the stakeholders.\n\n1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:33.240\n And if you're enthusiastic about it and you're engaged,\n\n1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:35.200\n then it's easier for people to come on that journey.\n\n1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:37.680\n And that's why people really start to think about,\n\n1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:39.840\n well, what is the purpose of what I'm doing?\n\n1:06:39.840 --> 1:06:42.200\n And it sounds corny and when I first heard that,\n\n1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:43.120\n I was like, it's kind of corny.\n\n1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.920\n But then I read this book by,\n\n1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:47.320\n I've got his name, Rick something.\n\n1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:49.960\n He wrote the purpose driven church\n\n1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:51.600\n and he had spoken at a TED or something\n\n1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:53.880\n and everybody went crazy about it.\n\n1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:56.600\n And he's like, a church should have one purpose,\n\n1:06:56.600 --> 1:06:57.440\n one single thing they do.\n\n1:06:57.440 --> 1:06:58.960\n And like his church,\n\n1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.360\n which was like one of these mega churches in San Diego,\n\n1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:05.720\n just wanted to do education for this specific country.\n\n1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:06.760\n And that's all they did.\n\n1:07:06.760 --> 1:07:08.360\n And they just, they benchmarked.\n\n1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:10.600\n I think it's very important to have a purpose and a mission,\n\n1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:15.600\n not everything, but a specific purpose of some kind of joy\n\n1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:17.560\n that you wanna put into the world.\n\n1:07:17.560 --> 1:07:20.320\n You wanna solve some kind of big, hard problem.\n\n1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:22.000\n And then everybody knows\n\n1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.840\n why you're coming to work every day.\n\n1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:24.880\n And then for the founder,\n\n1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:27.560\n when you dread going to work that day\n\n1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:29.720\n and you don't feel like solving that problem anymore,\n\n1:07:29.720 --> 1:07:31.120\n that's the tell.\n\n1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:32.440\n And a lot of times I meet young founders,\n\n1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:33.280\n I'm like, why are you doing this?\n\n1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:36.200\n And they're like, well, I was looking for an idea\n\n1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:37.320\n and this is the one I came up with\n\n1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:38.520\n because I think I'll make a lot of money.\n\n1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:41.040\n And it's like, you're gonna quit.\n\n1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:42.880\n You're gonna get to month nine or 10 of this\n\n1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:44.360\n and you're gonna run out of money\n\n1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:46.400\n or like your CTO is gonna quit,\n\n1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:47.720\n then your CFO is gonna quit\n\n1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:49.080\n and you're gonna lose your biggest customer\n\n1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:51.480\n and you're just gonna say, this is not worth it.\n\n1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:57.560\n And if using Bezos or Elon as examples,\n\n1:07:57.560 --> 1:08:00.560\n they just needed to see the world change\n\n1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:02.400\n in very specific ways.\n\n1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:04.440\n And Steve Jobs, they needed to see a change\n\n1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:06.480\n and it doesn't matter if they made money\n\n1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:07.840\n or they were losing or winning,\n\n1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.520\n they just went to work every day and they had to change it.\n\n1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.240\n It's almost like they didn't have a choice.\n\n1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:13.080\n No choice.\n\n1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.360\n Elon makes it sound like his torture, his whole journey,\n\n1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:16.800\n but he can't help it.\n\n1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:21.800\n Having been a witness to it, just as friends for that long,\n\n1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:25.240\n I have never seen an entrepreneur suffer more than him.\n\n1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:28.400\n And he's been public about that, like you do not wanna be me.\n\n1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:31.200\n He has suffered for those companies.\n\n1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:32.760\n He has suffered to get them where they are.\n\n1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:34.080\n It has not been easy.\n\n1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:36.920\n Can you second analyze Elon in that aspect?\n\n1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.600\n Like, is it just he can't help it?\n\n1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:44.000\n He must see the change that he hopes for in the world.\n\n1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.320\n He's just incredibly hardworking\n\n1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:49.320\n and he's very talented as well.\n\n1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:51.360\n I don't think people understand that.\n\n1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:53.800\n He actually is a really brilliant man.\n\n1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:56.080\n He actually is a really brilliant engineer.\n\n1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:58.960\n At the end of the day, he actually knows what he's doing\n\n1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.360\n and he asked the right questions.\n\n1:09:00.360 --> 1:09:02.840\n I mean, people were kind of aghast\n\n1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:05.120\n that he was asking Vlad such good questions.\n\n1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:06.400\n And they're like, oh my God,\n\n1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:08.080\n Elon's the best journalist on the planet.\n\n1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:11.240\n And it was like, anybody who knows Elon knows\n\n1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:12.080\n he has great questions.\n\n1:09:12.080 --> 1:09:15.240\n I mean, I used to have dinner in LA\n\n1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:18.480\n and my book agent also was Sam Harris's agent.\n\n1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.080\n And Sam and I met through John Brockman\n\n1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.080\n and we became friends because we lived near each other\n\n1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:25.640\n and I was friends with Elon.\n\n1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:27.840\n And then I used to invite them to both dinner in Brentwood\n\n1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:29.160\n because one lived in Bel Air,\n\n1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:30.960\n one lived in Santa Monica and I lived in Brentwood.\n\n1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:31.880\n And we would go to this place,\n\n1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:33.640\n Popone, this Italian restaurant.\n\n1:09:33.640 --> 1:09:36.400\n And every Tuesday for years, we would just,\n\n1:09:36.400 --> 1:09:38.000\n the three of us, every other Tuesday or so,\n\n1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.480\n we'd have dinner and I'd sit there\n\n1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.080\n and Sam wanted to know about AI\n\n1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.960\n and Elon's talking about artificial intelligence\n\n1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:46.520\n because he's on the board of DeepMind.\n\n1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:49.320\n Elon wanted to know about atheism and meditation\n\n1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:52.680\n and all this other stuff that Sam was an expert on.\n\n1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:56.360\n I got to sit there and just listen to these two guys talk.\n\n1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:58.720\n And they have both piercing intelligences,\n\n1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.560\n but Elon, he goes straight to the gut,\n\n1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:06.240\n like the questions that no engineer wants to hear\n\n1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:08.920\n is just the basic stuff that,\n\n1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:11.680\n it's like, why the hell are you doing it this way\n\n1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:15.960\n when the obvious solution is much easier or this or that?\n\n1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:17.160\n Why haven't you tried this?\n\n1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:18.000\n He can figure things out.\n\n1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.400\n I mean, he's a problem solver.\n\n1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.800\n I mean, and that's another thing,\n\n1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.200\n like I think the great entrepreneurs\n\n1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:24.720\n can look at a problem with very fresh eyes,\n\n1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:25.760\n like almost consistently.\n\n1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:30.120\n And Bezos described that as day one thinking, right?\n\n1:10:30.120 --> 1:10:32.400\n Like just pretend this is day one every day.\n\n1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:35.680\n And then other people use the term first principles,\n\n1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:38.400\n but it basically means like when you see a problem,\n\n1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:41.640\n pause for a second and really think through\n\n1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:43.400\n what is the best possible solution here?\n\n1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:45.760\n What are some alternative solutions and get from everybody,\n\n1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:47.000\n like how do we solve this problem?\n\n1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000\n What people do sometimes they get in a rut.\n\n1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.920\n They just come to work and they just go through their email.\n\n1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:53.680\n They do whatever they did the day before.\n\n1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:55.440\n They don't think, why are we doing this?\n\n1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:56.900\n And is there a better way to do it?\n\n1:10:56.900 --> 1:10:58.880\n Now you can get so obsessive about that\n\n1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:01.060\n that you can over engineer stuff\n\n1:11:01.060 --> 1:11:03.400\n and you can never actually ship a product.\n\n1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:06.600\n So there have to be some pragmatism and some goals\n\n1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:08.320\n and some dates associated with that.\n\n1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:12.280\n But it is a very cool thing to really think like,\n\n1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:14.640\n I wonder if we actually made the batteries ourselves,\n\n1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:15.480\n what that would look like.\n\n1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:18.880\n Or I wonder if we could get to two day shipping,\n\n1:11:18.880 --> 1:11:20.920\n or what if we do same day shipping?\n\n1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.100\n Like you need to have somebody who's willing to say,\n\n1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:24.280\n you know what, fuck it.\n\n1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.520\n Let's set a crazy audacious goal.\n\n1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:28.300\n Two day shipping of any product\n\n1:11:28.300 --> 1:11:29.680\n anywhere in the United States.\n\n1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:31.200\n And once you throw the gauntlet down like that,\n\n1:11:31.200 --> 1:11:34.040\n now everybody knows they're rolling in the right direction.\n\n1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:36.040\n Two day shipping, Amazon Prime.\n\n1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:37.800\n And that's what people didn't realize about Amazon.\n\n1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.080\n The business wasn't shipping all those products.\n\n1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:43.000\n It was getting you to sign up for Amazon Prime.\n\n1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.240\n They have hundreds of millions of people doing Amazon Prime\n\n1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:47.400\n for 10 bucks a month.\n\n1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:48.940\n I think globally it's probably cheaper.\n\n1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:51.840\n But that was the driver of that business\n\n1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:53.080\n was all of those people.\n\n1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:55.960\n Cause they would, you're an Amazon Prime subscriber?\n\n1:11:55.960 --> 1:11:57.280\n Do you know how much you pay?\n\n1:11:57.280 --> 1:11:58.120\n No.\n\n1:11:58.120 --> 1:11:58.960\n Exactly.\n\n1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:00.280\n It started at $50.\n\n1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:02.520\n And I think they even had like 40, 50, $60\n\n1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:03.920\n was like the testing in the early days.\n\n1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:08.480\n And now it's, I think $149, 12, $13 a month.\n\n1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:09.300\n If you pay for the year,\n\n1:12:09.300 --> 1:12:11.840\n I think it goes down to 10 bucks a month, 120.\n\n1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:12.680\n And you're like, wow.\n\n1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:14.960\n And it's like, yeah, you're paying $13 a month\n\n1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:17.840\n for the privilege of shopping at Amazon.\n\n1:12:19.220 --> 1:12:21.680\n But you say it's the greatest thing in the world\n\n1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:23.280\n because anything I need,\n\n1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:25.080\n if you forgot a microphone or a cable goes bad\n\n1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:28.360\n or a camera goes bad, you get it here within a day or less.\n\n1:12:28.360 --> 1:12:29.560\n It's pretty amazing.\n\n1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:31.000\n You've already been dropping bombs,\n\n1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.440\n incredible advice on startups in general.\n\n1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:38.440\n But let me maybe go straight in and ask,\n\n1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:41.880\n is there advice for somebody that wants to go big\n\n1:12:41.880 --> 1:12:44.680\n to build the big startup to help them succeed?\n\n1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:47.560\n Yeah, it's very similar to the advice I give to investors\n\n1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:49.800\n because now I teach angel investing\n\n1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:51.640\n because there's so many people who want to invest.\n\n1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.920\n And so I wrote a book on that angel\n\n1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:55.880\n and then I do a course called Angel University\n\n1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.400\n that I teach six times a year.\n\n1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:59.320\n And then I have a syndicate called thesyndicate.com\n\n1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:00.240\n where I invest in companies.\n\n1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:02.400\n There's 6,500 people who are members of that.\n\n1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:04.080\n It's the largest syndicate in the world.\n\n1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.760\n In fact, the first deal we ever did was calm.com,\n\n1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:07.580\n the meditation app.\n\n1:13:07.580 --> 1:13:09.360\n We put $378,000 into it\n\n1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:11.260\n when it was a $5 million product.\n\n1:13:11.260 --> 1:13:12.100\n A $5 million company.\n\n1:13:12.100 --> 1:13:13.840\n So we bought six or 7% of the company.\n\n1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:15.060\n It's now worth 2 billion.\n\n1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:15.940\n So you can do the math on that.\n\n1:13:15.940 --> 1:13:16.780\n We still own 5%.\n\n1:13:16.780 --> 1:13:18.040\n What year was that?\n\n1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:18.880\n Six years ago.\n\n1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:23.300\n So probably seven, yeah, maybe 2015, 2014.\n\n1:13:23.300 --> 1:13:25.600\n And nobody else would invest in calm.\n\n1:13:25.600 --> 1:13:28.400\n But Sam Harris was the reason I did because I asked Sam,\n\n1:13:29.560 --> 1:13:30.600\n tell me about meditation.\n\n1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:31.700\n And he's explaining it to me.\n\n1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:32.600\n And I said, what about this?\n\n1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:33.760\n You have to have like a mantra.\n\n1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:34.720\n How does it work exactly?\n\n1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:35.560\n I know positive.\n\n1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:37.040\n He was like, well, you know, you should just go to UCLA\n\n1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:37.960\n and talk to Diana Winston.\n\n1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.780\n And like, there's this whole project there.\n\n1:13:39.780 --> 1:13:42.280\n And I'm like, UCLA does meditation?\n\n1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:43.760\n He's like, yeah, there's a mindful institute.\n\n1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:46.880\n They're like teaching people to be Tahitian meditation.\n\n1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:49.360\n And they're doing PTSD and I'm doing brain scans.\n\n1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:50.920\n And I was like, oh.\n\n1:13:50.920 --> 1:13:53.200\n And then I talked to the UCLA people and they're like,\n\n1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:55.720\n it's real, yeah, like we taught Phil Jackson\n\n1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:58.080\n and Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O Neal did,\n\n1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:01.100\n you know, that's how they won their championships.\n\n1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:02.200\n They meditated.\n\n1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:05.720\n And I was like, hmm, if UCLA is doing it,\n\n1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:06.920\n Sam says it's cool.\n\n1:14:06.920 --> 1:14:08.960\n Well, fuck it, I'll put money into that.\n\n1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:10.360\n And that's the second biggest investment\n\n1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:11.680\n in my career after Uber.\n\n1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:13.840\n And it will in all likelihood become the biggest.\n\n1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:16.620\n I mean, it's between Uber, Robinhood and Calm.\n\n1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:19.020\n And long story short,\n\n1:14:19.020 --> 1:14:20.480\n when I'm teaching people to angel invest,\n\n1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.920\n there's really two things that you cannot fake.\n\n1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:26.920\n One is a product that is built really well.\n\n1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:30.140\n So if you look at Calm, Robinhood, Uber, Tesla, Amazon,\n\n1:14:30.140 --> 1:14:33.180\n these products are transcendent.\n\n1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:34.200\n They're well constructed.\n\n1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:35.840\n There's craftsmanship to them.\n\n1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:37.040\n They're great products.\n\n1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:39.440\n So you're saying not fundamentally like the idea,\n\n1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:41.640\n but the execution of the actual craftsmanship\n\n1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:42.480\n of the construction.\n\n1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:45.200\n The actual product is amazing.\n\n1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:48.840\n Then there's customers.\n\n1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.800\n And that every business has ultimately a customer.\n\n1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:54.660\n And that customer, if they are in fact delighted\n\n1:14:54.660 --> 1:14:57.760\n by that product, that's the magic.\n\n1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:02.640\n Because you need a team to build the product.\n\n1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:05.400\n And then you need customers to use the product.\n\n1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:08.240\n And really those three vectors are undeniable.\n\n1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:12.340\n Now, you can have great teams that build a bad product,\n\n1:15:12.340 --> 1:15:14.240\n doesn't happen too often.\n\n1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:16.000\n Or you can have customers who don't like the product,\n\n1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:18.160\n but generally speaking,\n\n1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:20.920\n a great team will build a great product\n\n1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:22.960\n or a good product that iterate,\n\n1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:25.160\n and then eventually delight customers.\n\n1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.760\n And so most people say the team is the most important,\n\n1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:32.040\n but there's a lot of smart people out there.\n\n1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:36.640\n And let's assume that you can raise money for your idea,\n\n1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:37.480\n or you have money,\n\n1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:39.560\n or you can just convince people to do it for free.\n\n1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:41.500\n If you make a great product and it connects with users,\n\n1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:42.340\n that's the magic.\n\n1:15:42.340 --> 1:15:43.160\n You look at Clubhouse,\n\n1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:45.660\n it's actually a really well designed product.\n\n1:15:45.660 --> 1:15:47.680\n And that product is connecting with customers.\n\n1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:49.000\n And if you were to talk to the customers\n\n1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.280\n or look at the product,\n\n1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.920\n you would see a well constructed product\n\n1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:53.520\n and a delighted customer.\n\n1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:54.920\n And you can tell the delighted customer\n\n1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:56.640\n by just the amount of time they use it.\n\n1:15:56.640 --> 1:15:58.160\n That's called engagement.\n\n1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:00.200\n It's the fancy word for how much they use it.\n\n1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:02.880\n And Snapchat, when that was going around\n\n1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:04.540\n and they were trying to raise money,\n\n1:16:04.540 --> 1:16:07.240\n they had a fraction of the number of users,\n\n1:16:07.240 --> 1:16:12.060\n but the top maybe third were opening the app every hour.\n\n1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:14.960\n And nobody had ever seen that before.\n\n1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:17.140\n People were using Facebook a couple of times a day,\n\n1:16:17.140 --> 1:16:18.100\n the top users,\n\n1:16:18.100 --> 1:16:22.480\n but nobody had ever seen people using it every day\n\n1:16:22.480 --> 1:16:25.400\n for a hundred days in a row, every hour.\n\n1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:26.360\n And I was like, what's going on here?\n\n1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.780\n It's like, oh, the ephemeral messaging,\n\n1:16:28.780 --> 1:16:30.060\n and then the streaks.\n\n1:16:30.060 --> 1:16:31.720\n They had created these streaks between people\n\n1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:34.440\n where every day and then people would be like on vacation,\n\n1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:35.720\n like, I just have to open my streak\n\n1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:36.800\n and keep my streak with Lex\n\n1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:38.620\n that we chatted every day going.\n\n1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:40.320\n And so they had this like addictive nature to it.\n\n1:16:40.320 --> 1:16:41.440\n And that's why Clubhouse was able\n\n1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:43.240\n to garner so much investment\n\n1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:45.880\n is the number of hours people were using it every month\n\n1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:49.500\n was just unbelievably off the charts.\n\n1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:50.700\n Some of that is execution,\n\n1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:53.560\n but some of it is the weird magic of the...\n\n1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:54.600\n Product market fit.\n\n1:16:54.600 --> 1:16:57.160\n Yeah, so there's something, I mean, Clubhouse,\n\n1:16:57.160 --> 1:16:59.560\n there's a, it's still a mystery to me\n\n1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:01.680\n because I also use Discord voice.\n\n1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:03.720\n There's an intimacy to voice.\n\n1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:04.560\n Oh, for sure.\n\n1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:06.560\n Well, you have people's, yeah, tent.\n\n1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:10.240\n It's, well, but like the video gets in the way actually,\n\n1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:11.120\n in a weird way.\n\n1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:14.320\n There's a privacy when you just use voice.\n\n1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:15.840\n People are not taking showers now, Lex.\n\n1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:18.720\n I mean, we're in a pandemic and people just roll out of bed.\n\n1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:20.560\n And the hair thing, nobody's getting haircuts.\n\n1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:22.480\n Nobody's hair is good, nobody's getting haircuts.\n\n1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:24.140\n People are wearing gym clothes.\n\n1:17:24.140 --> 1:17:27.120\n I mean, Zoom is just horrific to be on Zoom\n\n1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:28.080\n for five hours a day.\n\n1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:29.400\n It is exhausting.\n\n1:17:29.400 --> 1:17:32.040\n Well, it does make me wonder what,\n\n1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:33.680\n once we emerge from the pandemic,\n\n1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:36.240\n whether a product market fit,\n\n1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:38.320\n how that evolves with Clubhouse\n\n1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:39.240\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.080\n Yeah, I know Clubhouse is a beneficiary\n\n1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:42.280\n of the pandemic for sure.\n\n1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:43.840\n When do you think the pandemic,\n\n1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:47.440\n when do you think deaths will be under,\n\n1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:50.320\n let's say 200 a day and we'll have 200 million people\n\n1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:51.280\n on the other side of this?\n\n1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:52.620\n Because that's kind of what it takes, right?\n\n1:17:52.620 --> 1:17:54.340\n You gotta get to 150, 200 million people\n\n1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:55.760\n on the other side in America?\n\n1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.160\n I haven't, you know,\n\n1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:00.200\n I personally stopped deeply thinking about this\n\n1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:03.560\n because I've been frustrated for so long that.\n\n1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:04.400\n You checked out.\n\n1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:05.640\n I almost checked out\n\n1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:10.080\n because it psychologically allows me to carry on\n\n1:18:10.080 --> 1:18:14.240\n because I thought for many months now\n\n1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:16.600\n that testing needs to be done at scale.\n\n1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:17.780\n And it still hasn't gotten done.\n\n1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:18.620\n It hasn't been.\n\n1:18:18.620 --> 1:18:19.440\n It's so ridiculous.\n\n1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:20.440\n We gave up basically on testing.\n\n1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:21.280\n We gave up.\n\n1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:23.160\n Because we're, and we're all sitting there\n\n1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:25.560\n waiting for vaccine to come along.\n\n1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:29.520\n And the distribution of the vaccine is not, you know,\n\n1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:31.200\n it's struggling from the same kind of things\n\n1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.040\n as the testing.\n\n1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:33.680\n It's gonna take quite a bit of time.\n\n1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:36.960\n So it does, if everything goes great,\n\n1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:39.920\n meaning there's not a second strand of the virus\n\n1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:44.000\n that's going to create a second major wave\n\n1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.600\n that I am cynical enough to think\n\n1:18:46.600 --> 1:18:49.660\n that it won't be until mid summer\n\n1:18:49.660 --> 1:18:51.600\n that we start opening back up.\n\n1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:53.280\n Yeah, I think it's gonna be May, June.\n\n1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:54.660\n I'm a little bit earlier than you.\n\n1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:55.500\n I've been tracking it.\n\n1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.800\n There are 1.5 million shots in arms a day.\n\n1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:00.040\n I think this vaccine's been undersold.\n\n1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:00.880\n I mean, it's a miracle.\n\n1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:04.600\n Not one person who was in the trials died, who took it,\n\n1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:05.960\n and only one went to the hospital\n\n1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:07.280\n and they weren't even put on a ventilator.\n\n1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:10.120\n So, and the hospitalizations are plummeting\n\n1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.400\n and we're at 10% now in the United States.\n\n1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:14.840\n At the pace, we're going at 1.5 a day.\n\n1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:16.840\n I think when the Johnson & Johnson one comes out next month,\n\n1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.760\n it'll be 3 million a day maybe, two and a half.\n\n1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:21.120\n And we already have 100 million people\n\n1:19:21.120 --> 1:19:22.040\n who've likely had it.\n\n1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:22.940\n So I've been doing the math.\n\n1:19:22.940 --> 1:19:26.400\n I think we're like 60 days away, February, March.\n\n1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:28.120\n Yeah, sometime in April, I think.\n\n1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:29.960\n Anybody's gonna be able to get a shot\n\n1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.360\n and the number of deaths is gonna go below 200 a day.\n\n1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:34.400\n And once that happens,\n\n1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:36.260\n I think people have had enough of this.\n\n1:19:36.260 --> 1:19:37.560\n They're just gonna go YOLO.\n\n1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:41.680\n But see, the crucial piece for me\n\n1:19:41.680 --> 1:19:44.740\n that I've been focusing on is the social media aspect\n\n1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:49.480\n of how the, it's not just about the reality of deaths.\n\n1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:53.780\n It's about the state of the collective intelligence\n\n1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:54.840\n of the human species,\n\n1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:58.280\n which is determined by our communication on social media.\n\n1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:02.140\n So yeah, we can be collectively afraid,\n\n1:20:02.140 --> 1:20:05.760\n the fear can spread, or it could be YOLO can spread,\n\n1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:10.000\n or it could be like all different kinds of misinformation.\n\n1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:12.600\n And of course, during the election year,\n\n1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:16.680\n the politics influences our perception of what is true\n\n1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:21.640\n and not, but having real rigorous nuanced conversation\n\n1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:25.440\n about this kind of stuff is the way out of this.\n\n1:20:25.440 --> 1:20:27.520\n And that's where social media really comes in\n\n1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.320\n because social media drives division,\n\n1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:32.600\n where people form tribes and so on.\n\n1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:37.400\n And it feels like it's honestly a technology problem.\n\n1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:39.360\n People say it's a human problem,\n\n1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:42.520\n but it just feels like, I believe humans are good.\n\n1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:44.840\n Technology can enable them to be thoughtful.\n\n1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:49.520\n We talked earlier about the magic of Silicon Valley\n\n1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:51.160\n and then maybe going too far\n\n1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:53.240\n with the Facebook groups example,\n\n1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:55.640\n where you take out all that friction.\n\n1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:59.480\n What happened was we used to have something called Rchron,\n\n1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:01.120\n reverse chronological order.\n\n1:21:01.120 --> 1:21:03.000\n That's how you consume to feed.\n\n1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.720\n So any kind of social feed,\n\n1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.680\n like Twitter was in reverse chronological order.\n\n1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:07.720\n The newest thing was up top\n\n1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:09.760\n and you would just work your way backwards.\n\n1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:12.520\n And so it gave this like really fresh feeling.\n\n1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:13.800\n And then a guy named Dave Moran\n\n1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:16.520\n and the team over at Facebook realized,\n\n1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:18.400\n you know, there are some things\n\n1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:21.080\n that got a lot of attention two hours ago.\n\n1:21:21.080 --> 1:21:23.360\n And the stuff since then has not been as important.\n\n1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:25.760\n But if you miss that, there was a really good tweet\n\n1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.000\n where there was a really good update.\n\n1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.840\n Like somebody had a baby.\n\n1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:32.920\n Can we get the baby one at the top?\n\n1:21:32.920 --> 1:21:34.320\n And it was like, well, how would we do that?\n\n1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.680\n How would we know that that's the important one?\n\n1:21:35.680 --> 1:21:38.880\n It's like, well, let's put a like button on it\n\n1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:40.360\n and let's see how many comments there are.\n\n1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:42.800\n So if it gets a lot of likes or comments or retweets,\n\n1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:44.120\n let's show those first\n\n1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:47.080\n and then we'll kind of mix in the most recent stuff.\n\n1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:48.480\n And so when you're on Twitter,\n\n1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:50.760\n and then when Facebook did that,\n\n1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:52.640\n Facebook became so addicting\n\n1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:54.000\n because Facebook was on,\n\n1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.760\n what has got the most engagement?\n\n1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:56.840\n Put that first.\n\n1:21:56.840 --> 1:21:58.400\n So every time you opened up Facebook,\n\n1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:00.000\n you get the dopamine hit.\n\n1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.760\n And then what happens when you see the Bar Mitzvah photo\n\n1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:06.360\n or, you know, the enraging story\n\n1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:07.960\n about some injustice in the world?\n\n1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:09.960\n You retweet it, you write a comment,\n\n1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:11.880\n you share it on your wall.\n\n1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:15.840\n And thus this addiction to the outrageous,\n\n1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:18.840\n the outlandish, the inspiring occurred.\n\n1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:20.880\n And it used to be like inspiring stuff,\n\n1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:23.040\n puppies or some heartwarming story.\n\n1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.280\n And then it got dark.\n\n1:22:25.280 --> 1:22:27.000\n And then people started to realize,\n\n1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.160\n if I wanna show up on the top of my friend's feeds,\n\n1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:33.520\n if I say something controversial or I'm outraged,\n\n1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:34.960\n I get to the top.\n\n1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:36.720\n And then that's when outrage culture came in.\n\n1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:38.400\n And then that's when cancel culture came in.\n\n1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:39.720\n Everybody started to realize,\n\n1:22:39.720 --> 1:22:42.800\n if I try to cancel that person for being a racist\n\n1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:45.760\n or a sexist or a horrible human being\n\n1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:47.960\n or whatever they did that's wrong,\n\n1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:49.640\n I get to the top of the feed.\n\n1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:51.240\n And we all collectively started playing\n\n1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:52.800\n a very weird video game,\n\n1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:55.000\n which is how outraged can we all be?\n\n1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.560\n And to get to the top of the list.\n\n1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:59.080\n And then of course, with Trump, he realized it.\n\n1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:00.120\n And he's like, okay, yeah,\n\n1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:01.880\n I'm just gonna make fun of a celebrity\n\n1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:03.480\n and I get more retweets.\n\n1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:05.040\n Okay, I'm gonna make fun of Rosie O'Donnell\n\n1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:06.560\n for being overweight or something.\n\n1:23:06.560 --> 1:23:08.680\n And he just starts attacking people.\n\n1:23:08.680 --> 1:23:10.320\n And people are like, oh my God, what did he say?\n\n1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:12.440\n And he copied that from Howard Stern.\n\n1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:14.480\n Cause he was in New York and he used to be on Howard Stern.\n\n1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:16.200\n Howard Stern took over all the dialogue\n\n1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:18.520\n in the eighties and nineties because he was outrageous.\n\n1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:19.640\n And then Trump did that.\n\n1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:22.520\n And then social media incorporated that\n\n1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:23.800\n into the operating system.\n\n1:23:23.800 --> 1:23:26.560\n It became the actual device of social media\n\n1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:28.720\n was the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\n\n1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:29.960\n We've got something incredible for you.\n\n1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:32.480\n Everybody salivates like Pavlov's dog.\n\n1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:34.680\n Oh my God, I can be outraged.\n\n1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.200\n That's what's gotta be undone.\n\n1:23:36.200 --> 1:23:37.440\n And the only way for that to be undone\n\n1:23:37.440 --> 1:23:39.400\n is these things can't be billions of people\n\n1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:42.280\n where the most outrageous thing\n\n1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:44.400\n that happened in the world today\n\n1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:47.200\n in the last five minutes is now in front of you.\n\n1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:48.640\n And that's why people have anxiety.\n\n1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:51.680\n They don't sleep and they doom scroll all night.\n\n1:23:51.680 --> 1:23:54.480\n It's because the human mind was not meant to process\n\n1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:56.840\n this much suffering, pain, anger.\n\n1:23:56.840 --> 1:23:59.080\n And that's why we have all this mental health issues.\n\n1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:03.720\n Also, young girls or even adults watching other people\n\n1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:06.800\n post their private jets and their vacations\n\n1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:10.280\n and YOLO adventures on their Instagram\n\n1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:13.760\n to the point at which young people are now faking\n\n1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:17.240\n being on private jets to put on their Instagram\n\n1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:22.240\n and creating this crazy FOMO around their Instagrams.\n\n1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:25.480\n We wonder why people are unhappy.\n\n1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:27.040\n If you think everybody's on a private jet\n\n1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:29.240\n going to some Michelin star restaurant\n\n1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:32.160\n or whatever the coolest thing in the world is today,\n\n1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:34.440\n going to the Grammys, going to whatever,\n\n1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:36.480\n Coachella, Burning Man.\n\n1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:38.320\n You're like, ah, but I'm home.\n\n1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:43.120\n I'm in my house and I'm not at Burning Man.\n\n1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.200\n Getting inadequate.\n\n1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:45.040\n Exactly.\n\n1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:47.040\n So this whole system is creating\n\n1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:48.280\n the wrong set of incentives.\n\n1:24:48.280 --> 1:24:50.560\n I tend to believe it's possible\n\n1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:52.840\n to still have extremely high engagement\n\n1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:55.640\n and create a successful profitable business\n\n1:24:55.640 --> 1:24:58.480\n while encouraging personal growth,\n\n1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:01.240\n like encouraging people to be the best version of themselves.\n\n1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:02.880\n I just think we haven't,\n\n1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:05.520\n we got the first generation of social networks.\n\n1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.200\n I think a new generation needs to be built.\n\n1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:08.040\n Absolutely.\n\n1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:09.360\n Is that your plan for a business?\n\n1:25:09.360 --> 1:25:13.200\n Well, I have a longer term plan in terms of ambition,\n\n1:25:13.200 --> 1:25:18.200\n which is I believe in being able to have deep connection\n\n1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:23.920\n between human and AI systems, like partners, friends.\n\n1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:26.200\n There is a connection to there with social media.\n\n1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:31.200\n I do think AI has a strong role to play in representing us,\n\n1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:36.200\n in guiding us in how we consume social media.\n\n1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:41.000\n So this algorithm that controls the feed for Facebook\n\n1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.960\n is a somewhat centralized algorithm,\n\n1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:47.040\n but instead to give more power to the people,\n\n1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:50.160\n individuals to where each one of us have our own algorithm.\n\n1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.200\n Bring your own algorithm.\n\n1:25:51.200 --> 1:25:52.040\n Bring your own algorithm.\n\n1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:52.880\n BYOA.\n\n1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:54.080\n BYOA, I like it.\n\n1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:55.800\n Instead of bringing your own alcohol,\n\n1:25:55.800 --> 1:25:57.000\n bring your own algorithm.\n\n1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.280\n Well, I mean, if you thought about it,\n\n1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:02.160\n if we came and said, when I look at my Twitter feed,\n\n1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:04.440\n I would like to see the people with,\n\n1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:06.400\n who are the most helpful in the world,\n\n1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:09.100\n generous, kind, intelligent, considered,\n\n1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:15.160\n commenting on things that I don't already know about\n\n1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:17.240\n because I want to open my worldview.\n\n1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:19.160\n That could be a beautiful thing for society.\n\n1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:22.960\n And actually Jack was talking about potentially on Twitter,\n\n1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.720\n letting people bring their own algorithms\n\n1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:26.480\n and sort their feeds themselves.\n\n1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:27.320\n This would be a wonderful thing.\n\n1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:30.320\n I think it's one of the reasons Clubhouse has resonated\n\n1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:32.600\n is it's such a diverse group of people\n\n1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:35.600\n that I've been able to drop in on conversations\n\n1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.680\n with people who are nothing like me\n\n1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:40.160\n and listen in and hear conversations\n\n1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:42.000\n that I wouldn't normally be privy to.\n\n1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:45.320\n And everybody's like, oh, come join as a speaker.\n\n1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:46.160\n I want to do a room with you.\n\n1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:47.760\n I get asked every day, can we do a room?\n\n1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:48.600\n Can we do a room?\n\n1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.520\n Ask an angel investor, talk about startups.\n\n1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:54.640\n And I'm like, my usage of Clubhouse\n\n1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:56.800\n is going on my Peloton treadmill,\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:59.960\n putting Clubhouse on, picking a room and just listening.\n\n1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:02.500\n It's so delightful for me as a podcaster\n\n1:27:02.500 --> 1:27:05.560\n where my job is to talk, to sit back\n\n1:27:05.560 --> 1:27:08.160\n and just put in a couple of miles and play chess\n\n1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.040\n and listen to a Clubhouse discussion\n\n1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:15.040\n that is about relationships or some fashion or hip hop\n\n1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.600\n or whatever it is that I'm not part of.\n\n1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.100\n I just sit there and I listen and you learn.\n\n1:27:20.100 --> 1:27:21.360\n It's like such a delightful thing.\n\n1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:23.560\n I always think about these kids who go to college\n\n1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:25.420\n and I've always been so jealous of these Ivy League kids.\n\n1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:26.960\n They go and they're like, oh, I got to go to class.\n\n1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:29.280\n And I'm like, I would just love to sit there\n\n1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:33.120\n and listen to Professor Lex talk.\n\n1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:34.240\n What a privilege to sit there\n\n1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:38.240\n and let somebody else drive and talk and listen and learn.\n\n1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:40.000\n Yeah, that's the beauty of podcasting.\n\n1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.400\n But of course, Clubhouse creates a whole nother experience\n\n1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:44.240\n where it's conversations, it's different.\n\n1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:45.680\n I think it's going to be the in between.\n\n1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:48.640\n I like it as a, you release your podcast.\n\n1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:51.060\n Like you and I are going to release this podcast, right?\n\n1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:52.480\n And then at some point I'll have you on my pod\n\n1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:53.400\n when you want your startup.\n\n1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:56.600\n And then at some point somebody is going to be like,\n\n1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:58.680\n you and I will run into, and I ran into you.\n\n1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:00.600\n I saw you were on Clubhouse the other night\n\n1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.960\n and I was busy, but I was almost going to click on you\n\n1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:05.240\n and say, let's start a room together.\n\n1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.480\n But you and I will start a room together\n\n1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:07.640\n with Eric Weinstein or somebody\n\n1:28:07.640 --> 1:28:09.300\n or Sam Harris will jump in or Elon\n\n1:28:09.300 --> 1:28:10.880\n and we'll have a different experience,\n\n1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:12.160\n which would just shoot the shit.\n\n1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:14.400\n And it'll act as like a fabric\n\n1:28:15.520 --> 1:28:19.860\n and a little filler between the tent pole podcasts, right?\n\n1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:22.040\n Like you and Eric, you've done three, I think, with Eric.\n\n1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:24.200\n Yeah, it was your four, I haven't released the fourth yet.\n\n1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:26.400\n Oh, okay, so I watched all three\n\n1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:28.440\n because I really thought your you way\n\n1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:30.720\n and him like giving you advice\n\n1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:32.160\n is very interesting dynamic.\n\n1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:34.560\n I thought it was very interesting dynamic.\n\n1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:36.520\n And I find him like a fascinating cat.\n\n1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:39.560\n We know everybody in common, except we've never met.\n\n1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:41.920\n It's very weird because you think about the social graph\n\n1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:42.760\n in the real world.\n\n1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.240\n This is why I think augmented reality\n\n1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:48.440\n is going to be such an amazing product.\n\n1:28:48.440 --> 1:28:50.120\n I just have one killer feature I want\n\n1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:54.160\n for augmented reality, we wear our glasses.\n\n1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.000\n And when I look at you above your head,\n\n1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:59.440\n I see the relationships we have\n\n1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.840\n and the things we've done together, right?\n\n1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:04.160\n So I see, oh, you both know Sam Harris\n\n1:29:04.160 --> 1:29:06.880\n or you had Elon on the podcast on this date\n\n1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.160\n or you and I were both at Burning Man in 2016.\n\n1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:12.780\n So it's the most meaningful element\n\n1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:14.540\n of our connection in the network, yeah.\n\n1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:16.920\n And then, cause we would discover that through small talk,\n\n1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:19.400\n but imagine you're like at a party and you look\n\n1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:23.640\n and it just, people glow and you just see a glow\n\n1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:25.600\n around a person and like green means\n\n1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:27.060\n you have some financial relationship.\n\n1:29:27.060 --> 1:29:29.040\n Blue means you have some friendship one\n\n1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:30.520\n or yellow means you have friendship one.\n\n1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:33.160\n Blue means you know nothing about each other.\n\n1:29:33.160 --> 1:29:34.080\n You have no connections.\n\n1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:37.000\n You're like, wow, these blue people have no connection to.\n\n1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:38.760\n These people, that one's glowing red.\n\n1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:41.040\n We know seven or more people in common.\n\n1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:42.240\n And those are the seven people.\n\n1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:45.200\n Oh, we should go talk about how we know each other.\n\n1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:47.480\n That could, and that sort of happened with Facebook member\n\n1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:49.440\n or MySpace where you were like, oh, you know that person,\n\n1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:50.720\n friend of a friend.\n\n1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:53.600\n But that's what is going to be AR is like,\n\n1:29:53.600 --> 1:29:57.320\n this is why I think if Apple figures out AR or Snapchat\n\n1:29:57.320 --> 1:29:59.000\n and they just have those glasses, you know,\n\n1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.880\n forget about VR, it's just nauseating and whatever,\n\n1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:04.560\n but AR where you put the glasses on,\n\n1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:06.760\n you see the real world, but you augment it.\n\n1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:08.760\n You make a, just like you were saying,\n\n1:30:08.760 --> 1:30:12.320\n you make a frictionless, a very low friction\n\n1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:13.880\n to make a deep human connection\n\n1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:17.080\n because you have all the basic elements there already.\n\n1:30:17.080 --> 1:30:18.720\n Now think about the unintended consequences\n\n1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:20.560\n of what I just described.\n\n1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:21.800\n It could get creepy and weird.\n\n1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:23.640\n The privacy thing.\n\n1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:25.960\n I mean, people will, here's the thing,\n\n1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:28.560\n people, your privacy is an illusion.\n\n1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:30.640\n Like all this information is there.\n\n1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:35.440\n And then people are more than willing to give up privacy\n\n1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:39.600\n in exchange for some value, you know, it's a value trade.\n\n1:30:39.600 --> 1:30:43.560\n And giving, if my Tesla,\n\n1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:45.420\n when I'm driving in the direction of my house,\n\n1:30:45.420 --> 1:30:47.800\n just starts the navigation and saves me three clicks\n\n1:30:47.800 --> 1:30:49.440\n and that friction's gone,\n\n1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.760\n I'm willing to give Tesla my location\n\n1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:53.660\n and my home address, right?\n\n1:30:53.660 --> 1:30:55.040\n I'm not willing to give Zuckerberg anything\n\n1:30:55.040 --> 1:30:56.960\n because I don't trust him, but you get the idea.\n\n1:30:56.960 --> 1:30:59.240\n I mean, it will be that way with like DNA and other things\n\n1:30:59.240 --> 1:31:01.200\n at some point we'll just be like, yeah, just take my DNA.\n\n1:31:01.200 --> 1:31:02.320\n Like I don't, yeah, sure.\n\n1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:05.040\n People can look and see that I'm a mental midget\n\n1:31:05.040 --> 1:31:06.800\n and my IQ is like lower than,\n\n1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:08.560\n I don't want to bring the bell curve up or whatever,\n\n1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:10.960\n but you could figure out,\n\n1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:13.880\n like if we all put our DNA in a sequence online\n\n1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:17.120\n and be like, oh yeah, you know, Lex has got 10 more IQ points\n\n1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:20.040\n than Jcal and, you know, Sam's got 10 more than Lex.\n\n1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:22.200\n And all of a sudden people are like all bed out of shape\n\n1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:23.880\n about it, but what if they, we did that?\n\n1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:25.600\n And they were like, and by the way, you also,\n\n1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:27.440\n all three of you are going to get Parkinson's\n\n1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:29.440\n unless you do X, Y, and Z,\n\n1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:31.880\n unless you eat more blueberries or whatever we figure out.\n\n1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:33.440\n They're going to accept it pretty quickly.\n\n1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:35.240\n Yeah, that's brave new world.\n\n1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:36.120\n Brave new world.\n\n1:31:36.120 --> 1:31:39.780\n I have to ask you, you're, just like you were saying,\n\n1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:42.660\n you're one of the world experts in investing\n\n1:31:42.660 --> 1:31:47.660\n and in startups, yeah, VC and so on.\n\n1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:50.600\n From the perspective of the startup,\n\n1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:54.120\n I was always kind of skeptical of raising money.\n\n1:31:54.120 --> 1:31:57.320\n It feels like people do it too quickly, too easily,\n\n1:31:57.320 --> 1:32:00.420\n but I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.\n\n1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:04.520\n When is the, when should a startup raise money?\n\n1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:07.160\n And from the perspective of the investor,\n\n1:32:07.160 --> 1:32:10.120\n when should the investor invest in a startup?\n\n1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:12.080\n Like, is there a timing thing here?\n\n1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:14.520\n Is there a, what, yeah, what?\n\n1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:16.560\n It's a very important question\n\n1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:19.460\n because the venture capital community\n\n1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:24.120\n is only going to fund, you know, sub 1% of enterprises\n\n1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:26.080\n started in the United States every year,\n\n1:32:26.080 --> 1:32:29.840\n like maybe 10 basis points of them, like one in a thousand.\n\n1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:33.360\n And the reason is it's jet fuel.\n\n1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:35.080\n You only want to take that money\n\n1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:36.880\n if you really want to build something big\n\n1:32:36.880 --> 1:32:38.400\n and you want to build it fast.\n\n1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:42.080\n And when you put jet fuel behind a startup,\n\n1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:43.560\n as we've seen with other rockets,\n\n1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:45.920\n things can blow up and people can die.\n\n1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:47.280\n You know, it's not people literally dying,\n\n1:32:47.280 --> 1:32:49.340\n but the business can go up in smoke, right?\n\n1:32:49.340 --> 1:32:52.880\n Like rockets get blown up all the time at SpaceX\n\n1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.160\n as part of their ambitious plans.\n\n1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.240\n And startups, seven out of 10 startups we invest in,\n\n1:32:57.240 --> 1:32:58.600\n go to zero.\n\n1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:00.160\n Now, if you were to start the business\n\n1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:01.900\n and only build it off customer revenue\n\n1:33:01.900 --> 1:33:03.980\n and use your own money and go nice and slow\n\n1:33:03.980 --> 1:33:05.620\n and grow 10% a year,\n\n1:33:05.620 --> 1:33:09.360\n the chances of you blowing up the rocket are very low\n\n1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:11.040\n because you're riding a bicycle.\n\n1:33:12.280 --> 1:33:13.400\n You can go a little faster,\n\n1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:15.560\n but the bicycle can only go so fast.\n\n1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:18.300\n And once you start taking that money,\n\n1:33:18.300 --> 1:33:21.880\n the way venture capital is constructed\n\n1:33:21.880 --> 1:33:26.880\n as in the mix of like MIT or Harvard's endowments is,\n\n1:33:28.180 --> 1:33:31.240\n you know, we're going to put some money into safe things\n\n1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:32.080\n and then we're going to have\n\n1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:33.800\n these really binary things over here.\n\n1:33:33.800 --> 1:33:38.400\n And they probably put 5% in venture capital traditionally.\n\n1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:40.640\n It's grown to 20% just as a function\n\n1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:42.720\n of how successful it's been.\n\n1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:44.920\n So, you know, the Harvards of the world and MIT\n\n1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:48.040\n is probably want five or 10% in venture,\n\n1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.120\n but it's grown to 25% because, you know,\n\n1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:53.540\n companies like Airbnb and Uber have grown so big and Tesla.\n\n1:33:53.540 --> 1:33:56.680\n But the goal is in these venture funds,\n\n1:33:56.680 --> 1:33:58.660\n we're going to invest in 30 names\n\n1:33:58.660 --> 1:34:01.660\n and one or two of them are going to return three times\n\n1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:03.000\n the capital we've deployed.\n\n1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.200\n So it's a $300 million fund and there's 30 names\n\n1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:06.440\n and they each got 10 million.\n\n1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:08.360\n That means one of the 10 million\n\n1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:11.120\n is going to return the fund plus.\n\n1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.920\n So that means it has to grow 30X and then 60X\n\n1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:17.000\n to double the fund.\n\n1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.600\n And you're really supposed to be doing\n\n1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:19.960\n three times cash on cash.\n\n1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:21.840\n So that $300 million funds,\n\n1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:25.040\n the expectation is in 10 years to return 900 million,\n\n1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:27.200\n triple the person's money as opposed to the stock market,\n\n1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:29.360\n which doubles your money in the same period.\n\n1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720\n So you're supposed to do 25% annualized returns\n\n1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:35.520\n in order to triple the money.\n\n1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.960\n And maybe I have an outlying chance\n\n1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:38.060\n of four or five times the money,\n\n1:34:38.060 --> 1:34:39.840\n which does happen sometimes when you have an outlier\n\n1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:42.660\n in your portfolio like Uber or Facebook was.\n\n1:34:42.660 --> 1:34:46.600\n And what that means is the venture capitalist behavior\n\n1:34:46.600 --> 1:34:47.840\n in the game they're playing is different\n\n1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:48.920\n than you as the founder.\n\n1:34:48.920 --> 1:34:51.560\n You as the founder, you may really care about this\n\n1:34:51.560 --> 1:34:53.800\n and it dying really matters to you.\n\n1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:55.160\n And then you got a venture capitalist who's like,\n\n1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:56.080\n we're betting on 30 names,\n\n1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:59.680\n we need two of them to hit it out of the park, maybe three,\n\n1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:01.340\n and nothing else is meaningful.\n\n1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:05.820\n So now you start thinking about the game theory there.\n\n1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:09.780\n You're dealing with money that is coming in\n\n1:35:09.780 --> 1:35:13.660\n that only cares about you going 100X.\n\n1:35:13.660 --> 1:35:17.100\n It's a whole different ball game.\n\n1:35:17.100 --> 1:35:19.180\n Whereas if you build off revenue, you don't have to do that.\n\n1:35:19.180 --> 1:35:20.900\n And if you look at a company like com.com,\n\n1:35:20.900 --> 1:35:23.300\n we invested at 5 million, the next round they did was 250.\n\n1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:25.220\n They were so capital efficient\n\n1:35:25.220 --> 1:35:27.900\n that they grew from $10,000 a month in revenue\n\n1:35:27.900 --> 1:35:30.180\n to millions of dollars a month in revenue\n\n1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:32.300\n over those four years since we invested\n\n1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:34.780\n and they didn't raise money in between.\n\n1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:35.980\n It was unbelievable.\n\n1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:37.780\n And I've only seen this happen three or four times.\n\n1:35:37.780 --> 1:35:40.980\n So it doesn't happen all this capital efficient meaning\n\n1:35:40.980 --> 1:35:43.540\n based on customer revenue alone\n\n1:35:43.540 --> 1:35:47.100\n plus some small amount of fundraising, you're able to go.\n\n1:35:47.100 --> 1:35:49.500\n Like how hard is it to do that?\n\n1:35:49.500 --> 1:35:52.500\n It takes extreme product market fit.\n\n1:35:52.500 --> 1:35:54.380\n You have to have a great price for your product\n\n1:35:54.380 --> 1:35:55.680\n that has a great margin.\n\n1:35:56.860 --> 1:35:59.260\n Yeah, and if you're doing something in hardware,\n\n1:35:59.260 --> 1:36:00.380\n it's probably impossible\n\n1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:01.660\n because it's super capital intensive.\n\n1:36:01.660 --> 1:36:03.780\n So it's probably gotta be a software business.\n\n1:36:03.780 --> 1:36:05.720\n Hardware businesses take a lot more.\n\n1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:08.620\n Do venture capitals get in the way at all of the business\n\n1:36:08.620 --> 1:36:11.060\n or is it possible to get out of the way?\n\n1:36:11.060 --> 1:36:13.500\n Yeah, if you get young venture capitalists\n\n1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:14.780\n who are starting their career,\n\n1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:16.660\n they're very nervous and scared\n\n1:36:16.660 --> 1:36:18.780\n because they're putting all these bets.\n\n1:36:18.780 --> 1:36:21.820\n And then there's a very weird thing that happens.\n\n1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:23.860\n The bad news comes first.\n\n1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:26.860\n So companies that don't work out\n\n1:36:26.860 --> 1:36:28.660\n go out of business immediately.\n\n1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:31.580\n So if it's not gonna be Com or Robinhood or Uber,\n\n1:36:32.980 --> 1:36:35.380\n you know you have one of those great successes\n\n1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:38.560\n somewhere in your five, six, seven, eight as an investor.\n\n1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.420\n What is the first five years like?\n\n1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:42.620\n First five years, you feel like an idiot.\n\n1:36:42.620 --> 1:36:45.780\n Let's say you make these 10 bets.\n\n1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:49.640\n In year two, two or three of them come back\n\n1:36:49.640 --> 1:36:50.820\n and they don't have product market fit\n\n1:36:50.820 --> 1:36:51.820\n and they're out of money.\n\n1:36:51.820 --> 1:36:52.820\n And they say, can we have more money?\n\n1:36:52.820 --> 1:36:54.620\n You say, no, we have to go get it from somebody else\n\n1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:55.440\n because you have to prove\n\n1:36:55.440 --> 1:36:56.740\n that there's still a market for it.\n\n1:36:56.740 --> 1:36:58.220\n We may keep our pro rata.\n\n1:36:58.220 --> 1:36:59.420\n We may put a little bit in\n\n1:36:59.420 --> 1:37:00.980\n to maintain our percentage ownership,\n\n1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:03.980\n but we're not going to give you another big chunk of money.\n\n1:37:04.980 --> 1:37:06.240\n And that company dies.\n\n1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:08.820\n So now you've got 10 million, poof, up in smoke.\n\n1:37:08.820 --> 1:37:10.260\n Boom, 10 million up in smoke.\n\n1:37:10.260 --> 1:37:11.780\n So this is called the J curve\n\n1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:14.440\n where your performance goes down.\n\n1:37:14.440 --> 1:37:16.460\n And then it's only in years four or five and six\n\n1:37:16.460 --> 1:37:17.300\n it starts going up.\n\n1:37:17.300 --> 1:37:18.820\n And what you're seeing right now is the people\n\n1:37:18.820 --> 1:37:21.060\n who started like I did in 2000,\n\n1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:22.620\n you know, just 11, 12 years ago.\n\n1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:24.660\n In 2009, I started investing.\n\n1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:26.380\n We all look like geniuses.\n\n1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:27.460\n Why?\n\n1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:29.020\n We're at the end of the cycle.\n\n1:37:29.020 --> 1:37:32.460\n We invested after when the stock market was on the floor\n\n1:37:32.460 --> 1:37:34.100\n after the financial crisis.\n\n1:37:34.100 --> 1:37:35.780\n And it's gone straight up since.\n\n1:37:35.780 --> 1:37:36.620\n So everybody looked,\n\n1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:37.500\n there's a couple of little blips in there,\n\n1:37:37.500 --> 1:37:38.580\n but generally speaking,\n\n1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:40.460\n there hasn't been like a major crash\n\n1:37:40.460 --> 1:37:41.600\n with the exception of the pandemic crash,\n\n1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.860\n but that bounced right back.\n\n1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:45.740\n And so, you know, it takes a decade to figure out\n\n1:37:45.740 --> 1:37:47.380\n if you're good at it.\n\n1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:48.780\n And then if the market crashes again,\n\n1:37:48.780 --> 1:37:49.880\n everybody feels like an idiot again,\n\n1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:50.900\n the cycle starts again.\n\n1:37:50.900 --> 1:37:53.820\n So you are now as a founder,\n\n1:37:53.820 --> 1:37:56.880\n you are now inserting yourself into that casino.\n\n1:37:56.880 --> 1:37:58.540\n And now you've got all these other forces\n\n1:37:58.540 --> 1:37:59.860\n pushing and pulling.\n\n1:37:59.860 --> 1:38:00.900\n And you're growing,\n\n1:38:00.900 --> 1:38:03.220\n let's say your company was growing 50%.\n\n1:38:03.220 --> 1:38:04.460\n You feel like, wow, I'm successful.\n\n1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:05.620\n I made a million dollars last year.\n\n1:38:05.620 --> 1:38:07.420\n Now I'm doing a million and a half.\n\n1:38:07.420 --> 1:38:09.460\n And the first thing a VC is gonna say to you is,\n\n1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:10.300\n how do we triple?\n\n1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:12.140\n We're growing too slow.\n\n1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:13.180\n See, but that's, like you said,\n\n1:38:13.180 --> 1:38:15.420\n that beautifully is a rocket fuel.\n\n1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:19.020\n It's, in a sense, it's a kind of motivation.\n\n1:38:19.020 --> 1:38:19.840\n It's a drive.\n\n1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:21.020\n I mean, it's a positive.\n\n1:38:21.020 --> 1:38:22.060\n So if you want that.\n\n1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:23.700\n Yes, if you want that.\n\n1:38:23.700 --> 1:38:24.580\n If you want that,\n\n1:38:24.580 --> 1:38:27.100\n if you want to go to Navy SEAL school,\n\n1:38:27.100 --> 1:38:28.100\n you're gonna be in pain\n\n1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:29.820\n and they're gonna put that hose in your face\n\n1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:30.940\n while you're underwater\n\n1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:32.740\n with your hands tied behind your back in the pool\n\n1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:34.020\n and you're gonna be choking.\n\n1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:35.580\n And they may have to do CPR on you.\n\n1:38:35.580 --> 1:38:38.540\n And like every couple of years, tragically,\n\n1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:40.260\n somebody dies in Navy SEAL school.\n\n1:38:40.260 --> 1:38:41.180\n Yeah, well.\n\n1:38:41.180 --> 1:38:42.700\n Does it mean we're getting rid of the Navy SEALs?\n\n1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:43.940\n Brock, if he dies, he dies.\n\n1:38:43.940 --> 1:38:45.340\n I don't know if you know David Goggins\n\n1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:46.180\n as by any chance.\n\n1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:47.000\n I do.\n\n1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:47.840\n I mean, I don't know him personally,\n\n1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:48.820\n but oh my Lord.\n\n1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:52.260\n So I'm running 48 miles together with him in person\n\n1:38:52.260 --> 1:38:53.100\n in a month.\n\n1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:55.380\n What, you're doing an ultra marathon?\n\n1:38:55.380 --> 1:38:58.520\n With him and probably other stuff\n\n1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:01.100\n because he enjoys just breaking people,\n\n1:39:01.100 --> 1:39:01.940\n making them cry.\n\n1:39:01.940 --> 1:39:03.180\n Oh my God, I'm so jelly.\n\n1:39:03.180 --> 1:39:05.140\n So no, well, I offered,\n\n1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:08.260\n we agreed a while ago to do a podcast\n\n1:39:08.260 --> 1:39:10.980\n and he's like, oh yeah, come, we'll do it this day.\n\n1:39:10.980 --> 1:39:13.100\n Is he in the Bay Area?\n\n1:39:13.100 --> 1:39:14.340\n I don't know where the hell he is,\n\n1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:15.460\n but we're doing it.\n\n1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:17.580\n And I don't think I'm supposed to say where it is,\n\n1:39:17.580 --> 1:39:19.540\n but it's not anywhere close to anywhere of this.\n\n1:39:19.540 --> 1:39:21.220\n It's in the middle of nowhere.\n\n1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:24.220\n But he seems to be in a bunch of different locations.\n\n1:39:24.220 --> 1:39:27.260\n Like he's in Oregon or something like that.\n\n1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:29.260\n What does he do for outside of writing books\n\n1:39:29.260 --> 1:39:30.100\n and being inspirational?\n\n1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:31.900\n Does he actually train people or like?\n\n1:39:31.900 --> 1:39:35.660\n No, he's just, he's a full time insane.\n\n1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:40.420\n Like he fights forest fires like for a few months a year\n\n1:39:40.420 --> 1:39:42.900\n as a farmer, like unpaid labor.\n\n1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:45.020\n Like he, you know, there's a bunch of people\n\n1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:47.700\n who are like him, like Navy Seals and so on\n\n1:39:47.700 --> 1:39:49.300\n that kind of make a career,\n\n1:39:49.300 --> 1:39:51.220\n automotivational speak and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:39:51.220 --> 1:39:53.100\n He's not interested in any of that.\n\n1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:57.940\n He's literally interested in just doing hard shit\n\n1:39:57.940 --> 1:39:59.100\n all the time.\n\n1:39:59.100 --> 1:40:00.100\n Breaking himself.\n\n1:40:00.100 --> 1:40:00.940\n Breaking himself personally.\n\n1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:03.180\n He seems like he wants to break himself.\n\n1:40:03.180 --> 1:40:04.940\n And that book is amazing.\n\n1:40:04.940 --> 1:40:06.380\n And the audio book's amazing\n\n1:40:06.380 --> 1:40:08.220\n when he's talking about how fat he was\n\n1:40:08.220 --> 1:40:10.900\n and how he just had to go and keep running\n\n1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:14.420\n and his like legs are broken and he's just super pain\n\n1:40:14.420 --> 1:40:15.260\n and he just goes through it.\n\n1:40:15.260 --> 1:40:16.580\n It's really inspiring.\n\n1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:17.660\n Inspiring thing also.\n\n1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:19.620\n You could have videotaped yourself doing this.\n\n1:40:19.620 --> 1:40:22.300\n I can't wait to see you get destroyed.\n\n1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:26.900\n This is gonna be so entertaining for the lax audience.\n\n1:40:26.900 --> 1:40:28.340\n The pain.\n\n1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:32.260\n But the other inspiring thing is he's happily married\n\n1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:34.260\n and there's a partnership there that's, you know,\n\n1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:38.020\n everybody finds this attention as a push and pull\n\n1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:40.260\n that's beautiful, I think.\n\n1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:43.140\n But in speaking of a beautiful push and pull,\n\n1:40:44.820 --> 1:40:45.940\n how about that transition?\n\n1:40:45.940 --> 1:40:47.420\n Yeah, here we go.\n\n1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:50.900\n You and Chamath on, he's a friend of yours.\n\n1:40:50.900 --> 1:40:52.700\n Besties. Besties, yeah.\n\n1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:53.540\n Yeah, good friend.\n\n1:40:53.540 --> 1:40:55.420\n I mean, there's very few people in my life,\n\n1:40:55.420 --> 1:40:58.940\n him, Elon, David Sachs, John Brockmans.\n\n1:40:58.940 --> 1:41:01.180\n Very few people have supported me as much as those folks.\n\n1:41:01.180 --> 1:41:02.460\n I mean, I'm a huge debt.\n\n1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:05.660\n So he's also cohost on the All In podcast.\n\n1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:07.420\n We taped episode 21 today.\n\n1:41:07.420 --> 1:41:08.260\n Oh, today?\n\n1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:09.540\n Yeah, every Friday now.\n\n1:41:09.540 --> 1:41:10.380\n They wanna do every Friday.\n\n1:41:10.380 --> 1:41:12.060\n They're addicted like me and you are to podcasts.\n\n1:41:12.060 --> 1:41:14.260\n So you're going to release it when?\n\n1:41:14.260 --> 1:41:16.260\n It's probably released as we're sitting here.\n\n1:41:16.260 --> 1:41:17.820\n Okay, beautiful.\n\n1:41:17.820 --> 1:41:18.780\n Special guest on it.\n\n1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:22.020\n We had Draymond Green from the Warriors phone in.\n\n1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.180\n So we had our first guest.\n\n1:41:23.180 --> 1:41:24.020\n Awesome.\n\n1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:25.140\n Yeah, so it's really funny\n\n1:41:25.140 --> 1:41:28.100\n because he plays poker with us and we're all besties, so.\n\n1:41:28.100 --> 1:41:28.940\n Beautiful.\n\n1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:33.100\n So you guys went pretty heated against each other\n\n1:41:33.100 --> 1:41:35.060\n versus on Robin Hood.\n\n1:41:35.060 --> 1:41:37.540\n There's just two things I wanna ask.\n\n1:41:37.540 --> 1:41:41.020\n First, on the actual Robin Hood discussion\n\n1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:42.860\n and the Wall Street Best discussion,\n\n1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:44.340\n can you steel man his argument?\n\n1:41:44.340 --> 1:41:45.900\n What was the nature of the disagreement?\n\n1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:49.020\n Where, yeah, what is the little,\n\n1:41:49.020 --> 1:41:51.700\n because I don't think it's as big as spaces\n\n1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:53.940\n it came off as sounding.\n\n1:41:53.940 --> 1:41:55.420\n What is the nature of the disagreement?\n\n1:41:55.420 --> 1:42:00.420\n He felt that Robin Hood turned off trading\n\n1:42:01.380 --> 1:42:04.260\n because the hedge funds told them to\n\n1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:07.220\n and that they were bowing down\n\n1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:08.420\n to the pressure of the hedge funds.\n\n1:42:08.420 --> 1:42:12.020\n That's not true, but in a vacuum of information,\n\n1:42:12.020 --> 1:42:13.580\n you know what happens to people's minds,\n\n1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:15.060\n conspiracy theories abound.\n\n1:42:15.060 --> 1:42:16.980\n And sometimes there is a conspiracy theory\n\n1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:21.140\n and sometimes there's just the appearance of impropriety\n\n1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:24.140\n or a bunch of related things.\n\n1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:26.860\n Like when you look at the Trump situation with Russia,\n\n1:42:26.860 --> 1:42:29.980\n like was Trump trying to coordinate with Russia\n\n1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:34.460\n or the Russians just screwing with a bunch of like neophyte\n\n1:42:34.460 --> 1:42:37.820\n idiotic dipshits like Donald Trump Jr.\n\n1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:39.100\n who don't know any better.\n\n1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:42.220\n And they don't know that you shouldn't meet with the Russians\n\n1:42:42.220 --> 1:42:43.860\n and if you do meet with the Russians,\n\n1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:45.260\n you are probably a useful idiot.\n\n1:42:45.260 --> 1:42:46.780\n You probably should tell the FBI.\n\n1:42:46.780 --> 1:42:48.980\n Like they're just a bunch of idiots in all likelihood,\n\n1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:49.820\n who knows?\n\n1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:51.340\n And there's a vacuum of information.\n\n1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:53.020\n And there's a vacuum of information, we don't know.\n\n1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:55.180\n And the Russians are trying to compromise everybody.\n\n1:42:55.180 --> 1:42:57.660\n So would you call it a conspiracy\n\n1:42:57.660 --> 1:43:02.260\n or would you call it an attempted conspiracy?\n\n1:43:02.260 --> 1:43:03.380\n There was no conspiracy here.\n\n1:43:03.380 --> 1:43:07.300\n What it was was Robin Hood needed to raise billions\n\n1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:10.420\n of dollars to say solvent in all likelihood.\n\n1:43:10.420 --> 1:43:13.340\n And they weren't allowed to talk about it.\n\n1:43:13.340 --> 1:43:15.900\n So they were forced into not talking about it\n\n1:43:15.900 --> 1:43:18.300\n in all likelihood and had to come up with that money\n\n1:43:18.300 --> 1:43:19.140\n or shut down.\n\n1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:21.620\n And then what got me upset with Chamath\n\n1:43:21.620 --> 1:43:25.340\n and we had a talk afterwards that people don't know about,\n\n1:43:25.340 --> 1:43:27.300\n I'll talk about it here for the first time.\n\n1:43:27.300 --> 1:43:30.980\n On Sunday, we had to have a little, we had to air it out.\n\n1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:33.100\n Yeah, in the episode after you guys sound like\n\n1:43:33.100 --> 1:43:35.380\n you've had a private, you've made up.\n\n1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:37.580\n We had a private discussion, just one on one.\n\n1:43:37.580 --> 1:43:39.700\n And we said, listen, we love each other, we're besties.\n\n1:43:39.700 --> 1:43:41.380\n We've always been there for each other.\n\n1:43:41.380 --> 1:43:42.740\n What happened here?\n\n1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:46.260\n And what happened there is I'm fiercely loyal to my folks,\n\n1:43:46.260 --> 1:43:50.220\n whether it's Chamath or Travis from Uber or Saks or whoever.\n\n1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:51.860\n I'm just a loyal guy.\n\n1:43:51.860 --> 1:43:54.140\n And I'm always ride or die with my founders.\n\n1:43:54.140 --> 1:43:56.100\n If I invest in them, even if they make a mistake\n\n1:43:56.100 --> 1:43:57.340\n and Uber made plenty of mistakes,\n\n1:43:57.340 --> 1:43:59.980\n I always went on CNBC, on my podcast and said,\n\n1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:01.540\n hey, we're gonna fix these things.\n\n1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:03.340\n I'm in touch with the team.\n\n1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:06.140\n Mistakes were made, we're gonna solve them.\n\n1:44:06.140 --> 1:44:08.300\n This is a group of people with great intent\n\n1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:10.420\n who want to make the world a better place.\n\n1:44:10.420 --> 1:44:11.260\n And you know what?\n\n1:44:11.260 --> 1:44:13.380\n I was hated for a period of time with Uber.\n\n1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:15.540\n I was hated for it last week with Robinhood.\n\n1:44:15.540 --> 1:44:18.460\n I got a lot of blowback.\n\n1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:20.780\n But I think in both of those cases, eventually I was right.\n\n1:44:20.780 --> 1:44:22.220\n Uber is doing great stuff in the world.\n\n1:44:22.220 --> 1:44:23.980\n Robinhood is doing great stuff in the world.\n\n1:44:23.980 --> 1:44:26.020\n And I like to be loyal to my investments\n\n1:44:26.020 --> 1:44:27.700\n and my partners to just,\n\n1:44:27.700 --> 1:44:30.140\n I feel like if you invest and you're on the team,\n\n1:44:31.300 --> 1:44:32.580\n you have really three choices.\n\n1:44:32.580 --> 1:44:35.540\n You either fight for your team, you can go silent,\n\n1:44:35.540 --> 1:44:37.100\n or you can throw your team under the bus.\n\n1:44:37.100 --> 1:44:39.160\n And I've watched investors throw the team\n\n1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:41.060\n that they invested in that made them a bunch of money\n\n1:44:41.060 --> 1:44:42.860\n under the bus, not acceptable to me.\n\n1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:44.420\n And being quiet's not acceptable to me.\n\n1:44:44.420 --> 1:44:46.220\n So I always ask the founder, do you want me to,\n\n1:44:46.220 --> 1:44:48.560\n is it okay if I go out and defend you publicly?\n\n1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:49.980\n If they say yes, I do it.\n\n1:44:49.980 --> 1:44:50.820\n And then.\n\n1:44:50.820 --> 1:44:51.660\n That's beautiful, by the way,\n\n1:44:51.660 --> 1:44:52.620\n because what else do we have in this world\n\n1:44:52.620 --> 1:44:53.700\n if not friendship?\n\n1:44:53.700 --> 1:44:54.620\n Loyalty means everything to me.\n\n1:44:54.620 --> 1:44:57.060\n I grew up in Brooklyn where if you were not loyal\n\n1:44:57.940 --> 1:45:00.860\n and you were not loyal to your crew,\n\n1:45:00.860 --> 1:45:03.580\n then you were a Ronin.\n\n1:45:03.580 --> 1:45:07.700\n You were out there on your own flailing in the,\n\n1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:09.640\n trust me, you do not want to be on your own\n\n1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:12.260\n in 1970s, 80s, Brooklyn, Manhattan.\n\n1:45:12.260 --> 1:45:13.360\n You need to have a crew with you.\n\n1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.780\n I've gotten into, you don't want to get into a fight\n\n1:45:15.780 --> 1:45:18.260\n with 10 guys and be alone or just be with,\n\n1:45:18.260 --> 1:45:19.940\n you need a crew to survive.\n\n1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:23.840\n So I just learned early on, my dad owned a bar,\n\n1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:25.460\n just drilled into me being loyal.\n\n1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:26.540\n And so for whatever reason,\n\n1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:28.300\n I'm a bulldog when it comes to loyalty.\n\n1:45:28.300 --> 1:45:30.280\n And Shemov came out and said,\n\n1:45:30.280 --> 1:45:32.980\n these guys need to go to jail and they're scumbags.\n\n1:45:32.980 --> 1:45:34.540\n And I'm trying to defend them.\n\n1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:36.700\n And I'm in a position where I can't defend them\n\n1:45:36.700 --> 1:45:38.220\n because I don't have complete information.\n\n1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:39.460\n There is no complete information.\n\n1:45:39.460 --> 1:45:40.740\n It's in the heat of the moment.\n\n1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:43.300\n And then it becomes the number one story.\n\n1:45:43.300 --> 1:45:45.100\n And it's my number three investment.\n\n1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:48.180\n And Shemov has a competing company, SoFi.\n\n1:45:49.260 --> 1:45:50.940\n And he's killing my guys.\n\n1:45:50.940 --> 1:45:53.100\n And then I started killing his guys.\n\n1:45:53.100 --> 1:45:54.260\n And then all of a sudden we're like,\n\n1:45:54.260 --> 1:45:56.060\n wait a second, we're best friends.\n\n1:45:56.980 --> 1:46:00.400\n And we're swinging our swords at each other.\n\n1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:04.700\n And we're a group of the seven samurai who fight together.\n\n1:46:04.700 --> 1:46:06.540\n When did we turn on each other?\n\n1:46:06.540 --> 1:46:07.980\n And then everybody else who's on the pod,\n\n1:46:07.980 --> 1:46:10.780\n the two Davids, you know, both on the spectrum a bit,\n\n1:46:10.780 --> 1:46:13.020\n they got a little Asperger's or whatever.\n\n1:46:13.020 --> 1:46:13.860\n No offense, Les.\n\n1:46:15.260 --> 1:46:16.080\n None taken.\n\n1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:16.920\n None taken.\n\n1:46:16.920 --> 1:46:17.760\n I'm not saying, you know,\n\n1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:22.500\n but there is, you're into AI and you might be somewhere.\n\n1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:23.740\n It's not a coincidence, yeah.\n\n1:46:23.740 --> 1:46:24.580\n Might not be a coincidence.\n\n1:46:24.580 --> 1:46:26.200\n Anyway, we upgraded the two Davids firmware.\n\n1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:27.620\n We're gonna upgrade your firmware after this.\n\n1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:30.700\n I'll give you, yeah, you're on the 1.5.\n\n1:46:30.700 --> 1:46:32.060\n You have the three emotions now.\n\n1:46:32.060 --> 1:46:32.900\n Or should we add a fourth?\n\n1:46:32.900 --> 1:46:34.140\n Do you wanna go with joy?\n\n1:46:34.140 --> 1:46:35.460\n I'm on the 2.0 already.\n\n1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:37.020\n You're on the 2.0, you got the joy.\n\n1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:38.620\n How's it working out for you, the joy chip?\n\n1:46:38.620 --> 1:46:39.460\n It's difficult.\n\n1:46:39.460 --> 1:46:40.280\n It's painful. It's difficult.\n\n1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:41.120\n You'll get there.\n\n1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:42.180\n Just let it happen, Lex.\n\n1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:44.940\n Just let the joy happen.\n\n1:46:44.940 --> 1:46:47.220\n So anyway, we just talked about it offline\n\n1:46:47.220 --> 1:46:49.200\n and we decided like, listen,\n\n1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:52.020\n we didn't pregame that episode.\n\n1:46:52.020 --> 1:46:53.860\n And I happened to be skiing with my family.\n\n1:46:53.860 --> 1:46:55.500\n I had taken the first like vacation\n\n1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:57.540\n since this goddamn pandemic started.\n\n1:46:57.540 --> 1:46:58.820\n And I was having a wonderful time.\n\n1:46:58.820 --> 1:46:59.900\n And then this whole thing blows up.\n\n1:46:59.900 --> 1:47:01.820\n I'm coming off the mountain,\n\n1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:04.020\n just having a great time with my daughter skiing.\n\n1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:06.100\n And you know, and then I'm mixing it up with him.\n\n1:47:06.100 --> 1:47:07.940\n And you know, he had a short fuse about it\n\n1:47:07.940 --> 1:47:09.300\n because he was triggered, he told me,\n\n1:47:09.300 --> 1:47:12.200\n because he really feels like he's fighting\n\n1:47:12.200 --> 1:47:14.500\n to defend, you know, the every man.\n\n1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:16.500\n And I was like, that's what my team's doing.\n\n1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:19.180\n That's why they named the company Robinhood.\n\n1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:21.340\n We're on the same side here.\n\n1:47:21.340 --> 1:47:22.180\n And then over time,\n\n1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:23.660\n we've started to see the explanation come out.\n\n1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:26.780\n And you know, people who are friends\n\n1:47:26.780 --> 1:47:28.120\n are gonna have disagreements.\n\n1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:30.580\n In the podcast, it happened to happen very publicly.\n\n1:47:30.580 --> 1:47:32.080\n And we didn't know it was gonna become\n\n1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:35.220\n the number one story in the world.\n\n1:47:35.220 --> 1:47:36.980\n If Trump still had his Twitter handle,\n\n1:47:36.980 --> 1:47:39.220\n this would not have been a story.\n\n1:47:39.220 --> 1:47:41.540\n Trump would have said something about GameStop\n\n1:47:41.540 --> 1:47:44.220\n and he would have coopted the entire conversation.\n\n1:47:44.220 --> 1:47:47.620\n So in a way, going back to our censorship discussion,\n\n1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:50.300\n I might actually be in favor of Trump being censored\n\n1:47:51.180 --> 1:47:56.180\n only because how delightful has it been since January 20th\n\n1:47:57.300 --> 1:48:00.340\n that we can all focus on something other than him.\n\n1:48:01.380 --> 1:48:03.260\n He was exhausting.\n\n1:48:03.260 --> 1:48:06.620\n I mean, the amount of cycles he took on our processors.\n\n1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:08.940\n He monetized the conversation.\n\n1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:12.020\n And now this is a little bit more of a distributed,\n\n1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:12.860\n like this bunch of.\n\n1:48:12.860 --> 1:48:13.700\n Yeah, everybody gets a chance\n\n1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:14.940\n to be the number one news story.\n\n1:48:14.940 --> 1:48:17.420\n Everybody gets a chance to discuss it.\n\n1:48:17.420 --> 1:48:20.740\n So on a scale of one to 10, how much do you love Chamath?\n\n1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:21.740\n Oh, it's 11.\n\n1:48:21.740 --> 1:48:23.220\n I mean, I love Chamath.\n\n1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:24.780\n I mean, we played cards last night.\n\n1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:25.620\n We're besties.\n\n1:48:25.620 --> 1:48:27.900\n And you know, I would literally jump\n\n1:48:27.900 --> 1:48:29.620\n in front of a bullet for him.\n\n1:48:29.620 --> 1:48:31.180\n I mean, what's the lesson in that discussion?\n\n1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:32.940\n Because it was super, I wouldn't.\n\n1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:35.300\n I think the love was felt and the respect was felt\n\n1:48:35.300 --> 1:48:36.300\n throughout even when you guys\n\n1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:38.740\n are going pretty vicious on each other.\n\n1:48:38.740 --> 1:48:40.100\n Is there a lesson to be learned?\n\n1:48:40.100 --> 1:48:41.500\n Do you regret any of that conversation?\n\n1:48:41.500 --> 1:48:44.420\n No, I mean, I think he told me\n\n1:48:44.420 --> 1:48:45.740\n that he regretted some of the things he said.\n\n1:48:45.740 --> 1:48:47.020\n He said publicly on the podcast,\n\n1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:48.060\n like, listen, I was a little hot.\n\n1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:50.860\n I may have said things in the heat of the moment.\n\n1:48:50.860 --> 1:48:52.580\n But I don't live with too much regret\n\n1:48:52.580 --> 1:48:54.220\n because I always think about intent.\n\n1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:58.260\n As one of the nuance and intent have been totally lost.\n\n1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:01.340\n The idea that we could have any kind of a nuanced discussion\n\n1:49:01.340 --> 1:49:04.220\n about things seems to have been forgotten.\n\n1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:07.460\n And the fact that people don't look at people's intent.\n\n1:49:07.460 --> 1:49:11.180\n If you hurt somebody's feelings or you disrespect somebody\n\n1:49:11.180 --> 1:49:14.540\n or you do something mean or whatever,\n\n1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:16.940\n I always look at the intent, you know?\n\n1:49:16.940 --> 1:49:20.620\n And I've had people attack me and I look at the intent\n\n1:49:20.620 --> 1:49:23.260\n and I'm like, that person feels bad about themselves.\n\n1:49:23.260 --> 1:49:25.780\n Or maybe I said something and I insulted them\n\n1:49:25.780 --> 1:49:27.340\n and that's why their blowback's there.\n\n1:49:27.340 --> 1:49:29.300\n So I always try to think what's the intent of the person.\n\n1:49:29.300 --> 1:49:30.860\n And then almost universally,\n\n1:49:30.860 --> 1:49:33.660\n you talk to somebody and you find out,\n\n1:49:33.660 --> 1:49:37.220\n you ascribe some crazy intent that's not there.\n\n1:49:37.220 --> 1:49:38.540\n And they're like, oh yeah, you know what happened?\n\n1:49:38.540 --> 1:49:39.860\n I got in a fight with my spouse\n\n1:49:39.860 --> 1:49:41.500\n and I didn't sleep last night\n\n1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:44.060\n and I've had a lot of anxiety about my business.\n\n1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:47.460\n And I just snapped and said something about you.\n\n1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:48.540\n And it's like, oh, okay.\n\n1:49:48.540 --> 1:49:52.500\n Like I literally had somebody on Twitter this past summer.\n\n1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:53.700\n I had said something.\n\n1:49:54.860 --> 1:49:57.740\n I was complaining about a New York Times journalist\n\n1:49:57.740 --> 1:49:58.740\n and something I thought was wrong.\n\n1:49:58.740 --> 1:50:00.820\n And this person was a fan of that journalist.\n\n1:50:00.820 --> 1:50:04.220\n And they went, I kid you not, onto my social media account,\n\n1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:07.780\n found a picture I'd taken about how blue the sky was one day.\n\n1:50:08.740 --> 1:50:11.460\n They reverse image search the tree line,\n\n1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:15.180\n found the tree line on Google image search somehow\n\n1:50:15.180 --> 1:50:16.060\n with a reverse image search,\n\n1:50:16.060 --> 1:50:20.460\n found an old listing that some broker had listed\n\n1:50:20.460 --> 1:50:22.940\n on their website of my house,\n\n1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:25.980\n and then posted my home address, the value of my home,\n\n1:50:25.980 --> 1:50:30.980\n and doxxed me on Twitter.\n\n1:50:30.980 --> 1:50:33.500\n And I'm like, what is going on here?\n\n1:50:33.500 --> 1:50:36.860\n So I call the person and I look them up\n\n1:50:36.860 --> 1:50:40.100\n and they work in private equity in Boston.\n\n1:50:40.100 --> 1:50:42.620\n And I look and I'm like, this person works in Boston.\n\n1:50:42.620 --> 1:50:44.340\n This is July 4th week.\n\n1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:47.300\n So, and when I look at the person's LinkedIn,\n\n1:50:47.300 --> 1:50:49.340\n we have seven people in common.\n\n1:50:49.340 --> 1:50:51.380\n So going back to the AR conversation real quick,\n\n1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:53.700\n I'm like, okay, this person literally just doxxed me.\n\n1:50:53.700 --> 1:50:54.820\n I asked them to take it down.\n\n1:50:54.820 --> 1:50:57.180\n They told me they won't take it down.\n\n1:50:57.180 --> 1:50:58.220\n And then I look at it.\n\n1:50:58.220 --> 1:51:01.340\n So then I DM him back on Instagram, on Twitter.\n\n1:51:01.340 --> 1:51:04.380\n And I said, by the way, your boss, Susan,\n\n1:51:04.380 --> 1:51:06.940\n and I know seven people in common.\n\n1:51:06.940 --> 1:51:08.100\n And these are the seven people.\n\n1:51:08.100 --> 1:51:09.700\n Here's a screenshot.\n\n1:51:09.700 --> 1:51:12.420\n What is she going to think when I call her on Monday\n\n1:51:12.420 --> 1:51:14.420\n and you've doxxed me?\n\n1:51:14.420 --> 1:51:15.740\n Here's my phone number if you'd like to talk.\n\n1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:17.220\n He calls me.\n\n1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:18.420\n I said, what's going on?\n\n1:51:18.420 --> 1:51:19.260\n Why would you do this?\n\n1:51:19.260 --> 1:51:20.580\n He's like, well, I really pissed off\n\n1:51:20.580 --> 1:51:21.700\n about what you said about this person.\n\n1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:23.540\n I was like, you understand I've had like two\n\n1:51:23.540 --> 1:51:25.820\n or three stalkers and anybody who's a high profile\n\n1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:27.820\n like I am or medium profile,\n\n1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.300\n you're going to have weird things happen.\n\n1:51:29.300 --> 1:51:30.460\n You literally put my home address.\n\n1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:32.220\n You put my family at risk.\n\n1:51:32.220 --> 1:51:34.620\n What if I put your home address on my,\n\n1:51:34.620 --> 1:51:37.100\n I have 400,000 followers or 300,000 followers.\n\n1:51:37.100 --> 1:51:38.900\n You have like 300.\n\n1:51:38.900 --> 1:51:40.780\n What if I post your address?\n\n1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:42.140\n He said, well, I wish you wouldn't do that.\n\n1:51:42.140 --> 1:51:43.060\n I was like, well, I asked you kindly\n\n1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:44.660\n to take my address down.\n\n1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:46.340\n And I said, are you married?\n\n1:51:47.700 --> 1:51:48.860\n I said, how old are you?\n\n1:51:48.860 --> 1:51:49.940\n Are you like 25 or something?\n\n1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:51.660\n He's like, no, I'm 42.\n\n1:51:51.660 --> 1:51:53.060\n I was like, you're 42 years old.\n\n1:51:53.060 --> 1:51:53.900\n I was like, are you married?\n\n1:51:53.900 --> 1:51:54.740\n Do you have kids?\n\n1:51:54.740 --> 1:51:56.060\n He's like, yeah, I just had a baby like six months ago.\n\n1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:57.940\n I'm like, you're home with your wife.\n\n1:51:57.940 --> 1:51:59.420\n It's July 4th weekend.\n\n1:51:59.420 --> 1:52:02.940\n You're doxxing Jason Calagans because you're upset at me\n\n1:52:02.940 --> 1:52:05.620\n because I said something about a New York Times writer.\n\n1:52:05.620 --> 1:52:07.940\n He's like, yeah, this is the biggest mistake of my life.\n\n1:52:07.940 --> 1:52:11.100\n I said, I tell you what, let's forget it ever happened.\n\n1:52:11.980 --> 1:52:13.700\n And he wrote me back and he said,\n\n1:52:13.700 --> 1:52:16.620\n I just wanted to thank you for how you handled it.\n\n1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:19.060\n My wife said I'm a complete fucking moron.\n\n1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:22.380\n And he literally sent me an email.\n\n1:52:22.380 --> 1:52:24.060\n My wife says I'm a complete fucking moron.\n\n1:52:24.060 --> 1:52:26.460\n And I'm really sorry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:27.300\n And I wrote her back.\n\n1:52:27.300 --> 1:52:28.620\n I said, I wrote her back and I said,\n\n1:52:28.620 --> 1:52:30.420\n my wife says the same thing to me all the time.\n\n1:52:30.420 --> 1:52:31.780\n I said, welcome to the club.\n\n1:52:31.780 --> 1:52:32.740\n It's totally fine.\n\n1:52:32.740 --> 1:52:36.380\n But intent, nuance, it matters, right?\n\n1:52:36.380 --> 1:52:37.820\n And the person could be having a bad day\n\n1:52:37.820 --> 1:52:39.300\n and they do something stupid they regret.\n\n1:52:39.300 --> 1:52:41.260\n And what am I gonna do, cancel the guy?\n\n1:52:41.260 --> 1:52:43.460\n Or if I had called his boss,\n\n1:52:43.460 --> 1:52:45.220\n he would have been fired immediately.\n\n1:52:45.220 --> 1:52:47.700\n And then I got to live with this guy got fired\n\n1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:49.820\n and he's got a kid.\n\n1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:51.420\n And what is this personal destruction?\n\n1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:52.860\n Why are we doing this to each other?\n\n1:52:52.860 --> 1:52:54.660\n Life's hard enough.\n\n1:52:54.660 --> 1:52:55.900\n Life's hard, right?\n\n1:52:55.900 --> 1:52:57.620\n Like just getting through the day is hard.\n\n1:52:57.620 --> 1:53:00.380\n Yeah, and that little bit of empathy,\n\n1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:02.580\n thinking about the intent of the person\n\n1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:04.620\n allows you to then sort of deescalate\n\n1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:05.740\n this kind of conversation\n\n1:53:05.740 --> 1:53:08.220\n that social media wants to escalate.\n\n1:53:08.220 --> 1:53:10.380\n Yes, back to what we were saying.\n\n1:53:10.380 --> 1:53:13.860\n If this, in my younger years,\n\n1:53:13.860 --> 1:53:16.060\n I would have retweeted the guy's home address\n\n1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:17.940\n and my address and would have called his boss\n\n1:53:17.940 --> 1:53:19.220\n and tried to get him fired or whatever.\n\n1:53:19.220 --> 1:53:21.140\n And it's like, now I'm just like,\n\n1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:23.540\n why are we attacking each other?\n\n1:53:23.540 --> 1:53:24.500\n Life is so hard.\n\n1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:25.540\n I mean, this is what the pandemic,\n\n1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:27.580\n I think we should make everybody realize is like,\n\n1:53:27.580 --> 1:53:29.780\n look at how hard it is.\n\n1:53:29.780 --> 1:53:30.620\n Life is hard.\n\n1:53:30.620 --> 1:53:32.540\n And then just think about all the people suffering right now\n\n1:53:32.540 --> 1:53:34.820\n who are at home, the single mom or dad\n\n1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:38.580\n with two or three kids at home in public school.\n\n1:53:38.580 --> 1:53:40.180\n Maybe they've been laid off\n\n1:53:40.180 --> 1:53:41.820\n and their kids aren't learning\n\n1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:44.100\n and they're in a tiny apartment.\n\n1:53:44.100 --> 1:53:46.700\n I mean, this has been brutal for a lot of people.\n\n1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:48.500\n Not to mention people losing loved ones\n\n1:53:48.500 --> 1:53:49.940\n or maybe some people got Corona\n\n1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:52.220\n and now their lungs are still not right.\n\n1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:53.500\n Can I ask you about love?\n\n1:53:53.500 --> 1:53:54.340\n Oh, sure.\n\n1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:57.100\n I'm feeling it, you know,\n\n1:53:57.100 --> 1:53:58.900\n like we're an hour or two here, Lex.\n\n1:53:58.900 --> 1:53:59.740\n Yeah, you're feeling it.\n\n1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:01.540\n Feeling like we could become besties.\n\n1:54:01.540 --> 1:54:02.380\n We're getting it.\n\n1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:05.020\n I feel like we got a bromance going here, Lex.\n\n1:54:05.020 --> 1:54:05.860\n I feel it too.\n\n1:54:05.860 --> 1:54:07.260\n I don't know if it's Eric Weinstein level,\n\n1:54:07.260 --> 1:54:09.820\n but I feel like it's close.\n\n1:54:09.820 --> 1:54:11.380\n Yeah, I'm feeling the love.\n\n1:54:11.380 --> 1:54:16.380\n But we talked about those music to my ears,\n\n1:54:16.380 --> 1:54:21.380\n your whole rant on the Olympic nature of a startup.\n\n1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:25.180\n Is there a role,\n\n1:54:25.180 --> 1:54:29.020\n like what role does love, family, friendship\n\n1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:34.020\n play in that brutal pursuit of excellence\n\n1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:37.020\n that is building a startup, building a company\n\n1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:40.500\n or creating anything new in this world?\n\n1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:44.340\n Such a great question and totally unprepared for it.\n\n1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:46.860\n Because nobody would ever ask me about that.\n\n1:54:46.860 --> 1:54:49.420\n So I think it's why you've got quite a following\n\n1:54:49.420 --> 1:54:52.900\n on your podcast is that you're able to ask these questions.\n\n1:54:52.900 --> 1:54:56.700\n And I can tell one story because, you know,\n\n1:54:56.700 --> 1:54:57.660\n I don't talk about,\n\n1:54:57.660 --> 1:55:00.700\n I try not to talk about relationship with Elon that often\n\n1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:03.620\n because, you know, he's so famous now.\n\n1:55:03.620 --> 1:55:06.460\n I mean, when we met, I used to go out to parties with him\n\n1:55:06.460 --> 1:55:07.820\n and people were like, oh my God, you're Jason Calacas.\n\n1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:08.660\n I was like, yeah.\n\n1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:09.500\n And like, who's your friend?\n\n1:55:09.500 --> 1:55:10.340\n I'm like, that's my friend, Elon.\n\n1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:11.900\n And they'd be like, what, he's doing rocket ships?\n\n1:55:11.900 --> 1:55:13.580\n But he's told this story publicly.\n\n1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:14.420\n So I can tell it,\n\n1:55:14.420 --> 1:55:15.620\n and I would never talk about anything\n\n1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:17.140\n that he hasn't already talked about publicly,\n\n1:55:17.140 --> 1:55:18.500\n especially since he's so high profile,\n\n1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:19.980\n but it was pretty funny moment.\n\n1:55:21.940 --> 1:55:23.060\n There was a moment in time\n\n1:55:23.060 --> 1:55:24.380\n when Tesla almost went out of business\n\n1:55:24.380 --> 1:55:26.980\n and you've probably heard the story many times,\n\n1:55:26.980 --> 1:55:28.740\n but it was during the financial crisis\n\n1:55:28.740 --> 1:55:32.220\n and they were running out of money.\n\n1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:36.780\n And they said, you know, let's go get a steak.\n\n1:55:36.780 --> 1:55:38.420\n And we're in LA and we drove to BOA\n\n1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.340\n and I had my orange Tesla Roadster\n\n1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:43.700\n and he had his P1 or P2, like the red one\n\n1:55:43.700 --> 1:55:45.820\n that I think is in space now.\n\n1:55:45.820 --> 1:55:48.620\n And we drove to the valet and we had a steak together\n\n1:55:48.620 --> 1:55:49.820\n and we're sitting there.\n\n1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:51.420\n And I said, you know, I read the story\n\n1:55:51.420 --> 1:55:53.300\n and Gawker or whatever, you know,\n\n1:55:53.300 --> 1:55:54.780\n and New York Times here,\n\n1:55:54.780 --> 1:55:58.420\n you only got like five weeks of money left in Tesla.\n\n1:55:58.420 --> 1:55:59.260\n He goes, it's not true.\n\n1:55:59.260 --> 1:56:01.020\n I was like, oh, thank God.\n\n1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:02.100\n He goes, we have two weeks.\n\n1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:04.820\n I was like, oh God.\n\n1:56:04.820 --> 1:56:06.460\n I was like, well, what's going on\n\n1:56:06.460 --> 1:56:07.780\n with the rocket ship company?\n\n1:56:07.780 --> 1:56:12.100\n You know, like, you know, I know you did the one last month\n\n1:56:12.100 --> 1:56:13.340\n and don't you have one coming up?\n\n1:56:13.340 --> 1:56:14.820\n He's like, yeah, we've got the third one coming up.\n\n1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:16.380\n I was like, well, how's that going?\n\n1:56:16.380 --> 1:56:17.940\n I said, well, we blow that one up.\n\n1:56:17.940 --> 1:56:19.620\n There's no more SpaceX.\n\n1:56:19.620 --> 1:56:22.340\n I was like, so two weeks of money left in Tesla\n\n1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:24.260\n and SpaceX, you blew up the first two rockets,\n\n1:56:24.260 --> 1:56:25.700\n you blow up the third SpaceX, it's over.\n\n1:56:25.700 --> 1:56:26.620\n He's like, yeah.\n\n1:56:26.620 --> 1:56:29.460\n I was like, I can loan you a couple million dollars.\n\n1:56:29.460 --> 1:56:31.580\n I don't have like a ton.\n\n1:56:31.580 --> 1:56:32.420\n He's like, it's okay.\n\n1:56:32.420 --> 1:56:35.740\n Our friend, beep, has loaned me some money.\n\n1:56:35.740 --> 1:56:37.740\n And Elon's been super public about this.\n\n1:56:37.740 --> 1:56:39.380\n I would never tell the story unless he hadn't been,\n\n1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:42.300\n but he was talking, he never said who it was,\n\n1:56:42.300 --> 1:56:45.100\n but somebody had loaned him money to keep him afloat.\n\n1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:47.180\n He was functionally bankrupt.\n\n1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:48.620\n I mean, he had the equity in the companies,\n\n1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:50.460\n but the equity was quickly becoming worth zero\n\n1:56:50.460 --> 1:56:51.460\n and the financial crisis.\n\n1:56:51.460 --> 1:56:54.500\n And he's figuring out if he's going to go on vacation\n\n1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:55.540\n for Christmas or not.\n\n1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:58.940\n And he's on the phone trying to, you know,\n\n1:56:58.940 --> 1:57:01.420\n save both companies.\n\n1:57:01.420 --> 1:57:04.100\n And I said, certainly there must be some good news.\n\n1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:07.220\n And he takes out his Blackberry to date this conversation.\n\n1:57:07.220 --> 1:57:08.260\n I don't know iPhones.\n\n1:57:08.260 --> 1:57:10.780\n Takes out his Blackberry and he starts swiping.\n\n1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:12.860\n And he says, don't tell anybody.\n\n1:57:12.860 --> 1:57:14.060\n This is what I'm building.\n\n1:57:14.060 --> 1:57:15.900\n And he shows me the Model S.\n\n1:57:17.580 --> 1:57:19.860\n And nobody knew that he was working on the Model S.\n\n1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:22.100\n We knew he was doing the roadster\n\n1:57:22.100 --> 1:57:24.220\n and he was trying to save the company.\n\n1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:26.740\n And I looked at it and I was like, that's gorgeous.\n\n1:57:27.820 --> 1:57:29.260\n It was the clay models.\n\n1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:30.740\n So it was a full size clay model.\n\n1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:33.100\n So there's human beings standing around a clay version\n\n1:57:33.100 --> 1:57:34.380\n of this tiny little Blackberry picture.\n\n1:57:34.380 --> 1:57:35.900\n I'm scrolling through on the,\n\n1:57:35.900 --> 1:57:38.620\n remember that little pad or the ball on the Blackberry.\n\n1:57:38.620 --> 1:57:39.460\n I'm scrolling through it.\n\n1:57:39.460 --> 1:57:41.460\n I'm like, this is fucking great.\n\n1:57:41.460 --> 1:57:42.980\n And I just said to him, it's like,\n\n1:57:43.980 --> 1:57:44.820\n what's the range going to be?\n\n1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:46.500\n He says, well, I think we get 250 miles.\n\n1:57:46.500 --> 1:57:48.020\n I was like, 250 miles?\n\n1:57:48.020 --> 1:57:49.860\n He's like, yeah, I think it'd be the safest car ever.\n\n1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:51.220\n I said, what is it going to cost?\n\n1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:55.820\n He says, I think this could cost eventually 50, $60,000.\n\n1:57:55.820 --> 1:57:57.660\n I said, Elon, if you make that car,\n\n1:57:57.660 --> 1:58:00.220\n you'll change the goddamn world.\n\n1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:03.140\n You have to, this company must survive\n\n1:58:03.140 --> 1:58:07.860\n because the roadsters for like 2000 people in United States,\n\n1:58:07.860 --> 1:58:11.020\n this car is for every person in the United States.\n\n1:58:11.020 --> 1:58:12.860\n Every single person in the United States\n\n1:58:12.860 --> 1:58:15.100\n will want this car if it's $50,000.\n\n1:58:15.100 --> 1:58:18.260\n And maybe some of the people who have 20 or 30,000 dollars\n\n1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:20.660\n won't be able to afford it, but they'll all want it.\n\n1:58:20.660 --> 1:58:21.900\n It's gorgeous.\n\n1:58:21.900 --> 1:58:22.740\n And he said, you really think so?\n\n1:58:22.740 --> 1:58:23.980\n I said, yeah.\n\n1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:26.020\n So I got home and I talked to my wife, Jade,\n\n1:58:26.020 --> 1:58:27.700\n and I said, do you have the checkbook?\n\n1:58:27.700 --> 1:58:29.260\n She does all the finances and stuff like that,\n\n1:58:29.260 --> 1:58:30.660\n pays the bills and whatever.\n\n1:58:30.660 --> 1:58:33.700\n And I said, don't tell anybody,\n\n1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:35.140\n Elon's making this great car.\n\n1:58:35.140 --> 1:58:38.020\n And I wrote two checks for $50,000.\n\n1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:40.020\n And I just took out this paper and I wrote,\n\n1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:45.020\n E, comma, love the new car, I'll take two.\n\n1:58:47.060 --> 1:58:48.260\n And I signed it.\n\n1:58:48.260 --> 1:58:51.140\n I kissed the two $50,000 checks, put them in the envelope,\n\n1:58:51.140 --> 1:58:53.940\n and I FedExed it to him for Monday delivery.\n\n1:58:53.940 --> 1:58:58.780\n And I said to Jade, that $100,000 is going to be gone\n\n1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:00.660\n in 48 hours because it will pay for one or two days\n\n1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:02.100\n of payroll on Tesla.\n\n1:59:02.100 --> 1:59:04.140\n So we just added like, instead of two weeks of runway,\n\n1:59:04.140 --> 1:59:05.780\n he's got 12 days.\n\n1:59:06.700 --> 1:59:10.660\n And the checks don't cash, but then I read a story\n\n1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:12.620\n that he's closed the money, saved the company\n\n1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:14.620\n in like the next week or two.\n\n1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:19.180\n And a couple of months later, the checks get cashed.\n\n1:59:19.180 --> 1:59:20.860\n And I'm like, okay.\n\n1:59:20.860 --> 1:59:22.780\n Three years later, I get an email,\n\n1:59:22.780 --> 1:59:25.060\n your reservation number, it's from Tesla,\n\n1:59:25.060 --> 1:59:29.620\n your reservation number is 0000001.\n\n1:59:29.620 --> 1:59:31.540\n And then five seconds later,\n\n1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:35.060\n your reservation number is 000073.\n\n1:59:35.060 --> 1:59:36.660\n And I forwarded the number one to Elon,\n\n1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:40.580\n I said, you know, I can't take number one,\n\n1:59:40.580 --> 1:59:43.780\n a signature number one, I can't take that, that's yours.\n\n1:59:43.780 --> 1:59:45.260\n And he's like, oh, I got five of them.\n\n1:59:45.260 --> 1:59:48.220\n And besides, you're the first person who ordered it.\n\n1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:49.540\n And I was the first person who had seen it.\n\n1:59:49.540 --> 1:59:51.020\n You're gonna get me to be teary eyed.\n\n1:59:51.020 --> 1:59:51.860\n I mean, that's beautiful.\n\n1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:52.700\n No, it was a very...\n\n1:59:52.700 --> 1:59:53.540\n That's a beautiful moment.\n\n1:59:53.540 --> 1:59:55.100\n It was an incredible moment for both of us.\n\n1:59:55.100 --> 1:59:57.140\n And we talk about it sometimes, you know,\n\n1:59:57.140 --> 1:59:58.180\n those moments in time.\n\n1:59:58.180 --> 1:59:59.580\n And to your point about love, Elon...\n\n1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:01.260\n That's like the darkest moment,\n\n2:00:01.260 --> 2:00:03.660\n one of the darkest moments in his life probably.\n\n2:00:03.660 --> 2:00:04.900\n I think it was, I can tell you,\n\n2:00:04.900 --> 2:00:07.180\n it was the darkest period of his life for sure.\n\n2:00:07.180 --> 2:00:09.820\n And he's been very public about how dark that was.\n\n2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:12.540\n And I think, you know, this is why I have great sympathy\n\n2:00:12.540 --> 2:00:13.900\n for the entrepreneurs of the world,\n\n2:00:13.900 --> 2:00:15.500\n like the suffering and the pain.\n\n2:00:15.500 --> 2:00:17.540\n And when he talks about the suffering and the pain\n\n2:00:17.540 --> 2:00:18.820\n that all of these founders have felt,\n\n2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:20.420\n and then we were throwing rocks at them\n\n2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:22.540\n or criticizing them as they try to change the world\n\n2:00:22.540 --> 2:00:24.580\n and save humanity, and in Tesla's case,\n\n2:00:24.580 --> 2:00:26.580\n I mean, they weren't, you know,\n\n2:00:26.580 --> 2:00:28.540\n they weren't like delivering pizza.\n\n2:00:28.540 --> 2:00:31.420\n I mean, they were trying to get us off of fossil fuels.\n\n2:00:31.420 --> 2:00:33.180\n Like this was a big, heady mission\n\n2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:36.820\n to literally save the environment, the planet, humanity.\n\n2:00:36.820 --> 2:00:40.220\n And the way they shorted that stock and they attacked him,\n\n2:00:40.220 --> 2:00:44.460\n it was always perplexing to me why any human being\n\n2:00:44.460 --> 2:00:47.380\n who is standing on God's green earth\n\n2:00:47.380 --> 2:00:50.220\n would want to throw rocks at the guy\n\n2:00:50.220 --> 2:00:53.940\n who is trying to stem the dam of global warming\n\n2:00:53.940 --> 2:00:56.660\n that is about to engulf all of us.\n\n2:00:56.660 --> 2:01:00.100\n How dare they throw rocks at that guy?\n\n2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:02.140\n There's so many people you could throw rocks at.\n\n2:01:02.140 --> 2:01:05.180\n There's somebody who's making the Juul vaporizer,\n\n2:01:05.180 --> 2:01:07.900\n throw rocks at that scumbag, no offense.\n\n2:01:07.900 --> 2:01:09.780\n But like whoever's making the Juul things\n\n2:01:09.780 --> 2:01:12.300\n and is, you know, selling pina colada flavor\n\n2:01:12.300 --> 2:01:15.140\n to 12 year olds, like throw rocks at them.\n\n2:01:16.060 --> 2:01:18.100\n Somebody is doing something, you know, abhorrent,\n\n2:01:18.100 --> 2:01:21.540\n but not E, I mean, and yeah.\n\n2:01:21.540 --> 2:01:25.380\n Anyway, that car is, you know, up the road here,\n\n2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:29.740\n sitting under a cover with 20,000 miles on it in my garage.\n\n2:01:29.740 --> 2:01:32.660\n And then the Roadster number 16 is in the garage next to it.\n\n2:01:32.660 --> 2:01:34.500\n And every day I walk by the two of them\n\n2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:35.940\n and I get a warm feeling in my heart\n\n2:01:35.940 --> 2:01:37.900\n because I know he did it.\n\n2:01:37.900 --> 2:01:42.900\n Against all odds, against all odds, he pulled it off.\n\n2:01:43.100 --> 2:01:47.620\n And it was that moment, that month in that 2000,\n\n2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:49.540\n I think it was probably December, January,\n\n2:01:49.540 --> 2:01:51.980\n December of 2008, I think.\n\n2:01:51.980 --> 2:01:52.980\n You know, it's just 12 years ago\n\n2:01:52.980 --> 2:01:55.380\n when you think about 13 years ago, it was dark.\n\n2:01:55.380 --> 2:01:56.340\n I mean, it was dark.\n\n2:01:56.340 --> 2:01:58.740\n And they almost had the same thing happen,\n\n2:01:58.740 --> 2:02:00.100\n you know, in the Model 3 production\n\n2:02:00.100 --> 2:02:02.340\n in June of two years, three years ago.\n\n2:02:02.340 --> 2:02:05.340\n And I remember him just trying to get the Model 3\n\n2:02:05.340 --> 2:02:07.700\n out the door and the company almost crashed then.\n\n2:02:07.700 --> 2:02:09.020\n Most of these companies have, you know,\n\n2:02:09.020 --> 2:02:10.580\n these kinds of moments.\n\n2:02:10.580 --> 2:02:14.860\n And I think friendship is you get what you give,\n\n2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:16.620\n you get what you give.\n\n2:02:16.620 --> 2:02:18.900\n And if you are there for people,\n\n2:02:18.900 --> 2:02:21.340\n you're gonna feel so good about having done that.\n\n2:02:22.300 --> 2:02:27.300\n And then the reciprocation effect,\n\n2:02:27.540 --> 2:02:29.420\n which you'd probably know very well,\n\n2:02:29.420 --> 2:02:33.260\n is so great in the world that anytime you're kind to people,\n\n2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:34.540\n you build this incredible bond.\n\n2:02:34.540 --> 2:02:37.100\n And then what are we at the end of the day, Lex,\n\n2:02:37.100 --> 2:02:41.260\n besides a series of memories with the people we love?\n\n2:02:41.260 --> 2:02:42.300\n That's all it is.\n\n2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:45.620\n It's just a series of memories and moments.\n\n2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:47.460\n It's just moments.\n\n2:02:47.460 --> 2:02:48.780\n You ever see Blade Runner?\n\n2:02:48.780 --> 2:02:49.700\n Yes, of course.\n\n2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:52.140\n Do you remember what Rucker Harris says at the end,\n\n2:02:52.140 --> 2:02:55.060\n all of these memories gone, like tears in the rain?\n\n2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:56.940\n I mean, that's our existence.\n\n2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:59.420\n It just all goes away at some point.\n\n2:02:59.420 --> 2:03:01.100\n It's just these drops of rain.\n\n2:03:01.100 --> 2:03:02.420\n Each of those memories,\n\n2:03:02.420 --> 2:03:05.300\n just like one snowflake or one drop of rain,\n\n2:03:05.300 --> 2:03:08.340\n and they're all lost at some point, but they're here now.\n\n2:03:08.340 --> 2:03:10.500\n And that's why we have to be there for each other.\n\n2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:12.740\n That's why I feel like what I do\n\n2:03:12.740 --> 2:03:14.820\n is so important in this world.\n\n2:03:14.820 --> 2:03:16.300\n And I get such great meaning out of it.\n\n2:03:16.300 --> 2:03:19.020\n Just being a friend, just having these conversations.\n\n2:03:19.020 --> 2:03:21.340\n What you're doing on your podcast,\n\n2:03:21.340 --> 2:03:23.340\n just talking to intelligent people\n\n2:03:23.340 --> 2:03:26.380\n and spreading the word and the gospel\n\n2:03:26.380 --> 2:03:28.620\n of what they're saying and amplifying it,\n\n2:03:28.620 --> 2:03:29.940\n you're inspiring so many people.\n\n2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:31.780\n Every podcast, you get 500,000 people,\n\n2:03:31.780 --> 2:03:33.740\n a million people watch these videos.\n\n2:03:33.740 --> 2:03:35.740\n And there's some kid in Sri Lanka\n\n2:03:35.740 --> 2:03:37.380\n or some little girl in Afghanistan\n\n2:03:37.380 --> 2:03:39.860\n who's gonna stumble upon this on YouTube,\n\n2:03:39.860 --> 2:03:42.860\n and they're gonna change the world in the next century.\n\n2:03:42.860 --> 2:03:44.860\n Because it's not just about America.\n\n2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:48.300\n Our story's almost over, right?\n\n2:03:48.300 --> 2:03:50.060\n We were the story of the last two or 300 years.\n\n2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:51.140\n I hope it keeps going.\n\n2:03:51.140 --> 2:03:52.700\n But there's all these other places in the world,\n\n2:03:52.700 --> 2:03:54.980\n Sao Paulo and Africa,\n\n2:03:54.980 --> 2:03:59.260\n where people now have access to these videos.\n\n2:03:59.260 --> 2:04:00.820\n And somebody will hear this video and go,\n\n2:04:00.820 --> 2:04:02.060\n Elon did it.\n\n2:04:02.060 --> 2:04:03.420\n Oh, and that guy Jason was his friend.\n\n2:04:03.420 --> 2:04:06.580\n And, oh, and Lex does those interviews with him.\n\n2:04:06.580 --> 2:04:07.900\n Oh yeah, I could do it too.\n\n2:04:07.900 --> 2:04:10.180\n Your little magical moment of love\n\n2:04:10.180 --> 2:04:12.380\n amidst the suffering with Elon\n\n2:04:12.380 --> 2:04:14.260\n because you've talked about it,\n\n2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:15.620\n it'll have these ripple effects.\n\n2:04:15.620 --> 2:04:18.420\n It's fascinating to think about in decades to come.\n\n2:04:18.420 --> 2:04:20.540\n And new entrepreneurs being born,\n\n2:04:20.540 --> 2:04:23.380\n new, more love being put out there,\n\n2:04:23.380 --> 2:04:26.580\n and more support through these rough times\n\n2:04:26.580 --> 2:04:29.460\n when people are trying to create new things.\n\n2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:31.980\n I mean, that's a beautiful thing, that's a beautiful,\n\n2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:35.420\n I'm glad you think of friendship in this way.\n\n2:04:35.420 --> 2:04:39.420\n I'm deeply grateful that you're loyal.\n\n2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:40.260\n Every time you invest.\n\n2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:41.700\n In the way you are.\n\n2:04:41.700 --> 2:04:42.900\n Here's the thing,\n\n2:04:42.900 --> 2:04:45.700\n it costs you nothing to make this investment either.\n\n2:04:45.700 --> 2:04:49.940\n The amount of time it takes to be bitter or angry,\n\n2:04:49.940 --> 2:04:53.580\n sitting at home, to be disappointed,\n\n2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:55.740\n you could just channel that same amount of energy\n\n2:04:55.740 --> 2:04:59.660\n into being loyal, loving, kind, and there for people.\n\n2:04:59.660 --> 2:05:02.260\n It just only takes the intention, right?\n\n2:05:02.260 --> 2:05:05.060\n The water is gonna, those emotions are gonna flow, right?\n\n2:05:05.060 --> 2:05:06.060\n Like Sam would always tell me\n\n2:05:06.060 --> 2:05:09.460\n when I was struggling in my life and I talked to him,\n\n2:05:09.460 --> 2:05:10.300\n he'd say, you know, Jason,\n\n2:05:10.300 --> 2:05:12.660\n your brain is spewing all these ideas.\n\n2:05:12.660 --> 2:05:15.180\n Imagine you're standing, sitting by a river,\n\n2:05:15.180 --> 2:05:17.180\n and the river is all your ideas.\n\n2:05:17.180 --> 2:05:18.980\n You are not a slave to any one of these ideas.\n\n2:05:18.980 --> 2:05:20.260\n They're just whipping by\n\n2:05:20.260 --> 2:05:22.340\n like each of those little waves in the river.\n\n2:05:22.340 --> 2:05:23.980\n You can pick one of those ideas out\n\n2:05:23.980 --> 2:05:25.660\n and look at it and examine it,\n\n2:05:25.660 --> 2:05:26.740\n and either keep it,\n\n2:05:26.740 --> 2:05:28.860\n or throw it back in the river and let it go.\n\n2:05:28.860 --> 2:05:31.260\n And I was like, wow, Sam, that was like,\n\n2:05:31.260 --> 2:05:32.820\n of my entire friendship with Sam Harris,\n\n2:05:32.820 --> 2:05:34.660\n that was like the one moment where I was just like,\n\n2:05:34.660 --> 2:05:36.940\n oh my God, all my life,\n\n2:05:36.940 --> 2:05:39.660\n I've wondered about all these thoughts in my head,\n\n2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:43.420\n insecurities, you know, imposter syndrome.\n\n2:05:43.420 --> 2:05:46.100\n Like I didn't go to MIT, you know,\n\n2:05:46.100 --> 2:05:48.700\n I'm not the smartest guy,\n\n2:05:48.700 --> 2:05:52.660\n but somehow I made a career writing little 50K checks\n\n2:05:52.660 --> 2:05:54.140\n and now, you know, $3 million checks,\n\n2:05:54.140 --> 2:05:55.420\n but whatever, you know, little checks\n\n2:05:55.420 --> 2:05:57.540\n and being a journalist and doing this little podcast,\n\n2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:59.740\n and it's ended up to something.\n\n2:05:59.740 --> 2:06:01.660\n And I kind of, I'm proud of it.\n\n2:06:01.660 --> 2:06:04.260\n I'm 50 and I'm kind of proud of what I did.\n\n2:06:04.260 --> 2:06:06.140\n And I wake up every morning after I retired,\n\n2:06:06.140 --> 2:06:09.340\n I say, I kind of like what I do.\n\n2:06:09.340 --> 2:06:10.860\n I kind of like having the conversation\n\n2:06:10.860 --> 2:06:13.580\n and writing the check and then being on somebody's team.\n\n2:06:13.580 --> 2:06:16.220\n And I got offered to be in these giant mega funds\n\n2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:18.180\n and they said, Jason, you're in it,\n\n2:06:18.180 --> 2:06:20.580\n you invest in 60 companies a year,\n\n2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:22.100\n you know, 500K at a time,\n\n2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:25.180\n you put $30 million a year to work, come work with us,\n\n2:06:25.180 --> 2:06:26.820\n write one $50 million check\n\n2:06:27.740 --> 2:06:32.220\n and then you can go to Aspen and Cabo and Coachella\n\n2:06:32.220 --> 2:06:33.060\n and not work.\n\n2:06:34.420 --> 2:06:35.900\n But why are you doing all this work?\n\n2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:38.380\n It's like, well, the $50 million check\n\n2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:40.300\n is like, it's like a formality.\n\n2:06:40.300 --> 2:06:41.380\n It's just like being an ATM,\n\n2:06:41.380 --> 2:06:43.860\n like the companies are already huge by that time.\n\n2:06:43.860 --> 2:06:46.540\n I really want to meet the two people with the idea.\n\n2:06:46.540 --> 2:06:48.900\n I want to meet them in year one.\n\n2:06:48.900 --> 2:06:51.020\n I want to meet them on day zero.\n\n2:06:51.020 --> 2:06:52.500\n I want to be the guy who wrote the first,\n\n2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:53.780\n second or third check.\n\n2:06:53.780 --> 2:06:57.020\n I want a guy who wrote the 3000th check, the last check.\n\n2:06:57.020 --> 2:06:58.020\n It's fucking boring.\n\n2:06:58.020 --> 2:07:00.020\n And make that basic human connection\n\n2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:03.620\n and also be with them through the rough times,\n\n2:07:03.620 --> 2:07:05.420\n be with them with that first,\n\n2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:07.220\n I mean, the first early successes,\n\n2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:08.580\n I mean, that's a beautiful.\n\n2:07:08.580 --> 2:07:09.420\n So great.\n\n2:07:09.420 --> 2:07:13.980\n When a founder and that team get product market fit\n\n2:07:13.980 --> 2:07:16.420\n and you just know it's going to work,\n\n2:07:16.420 --> 2:07:18.380\n oh man, Lex, it's,\n\n2:07:18.380 --> 2:07:21.580\n when Comm would email me and they'd say,\n\n2:07:21.580 --> 2:07:24.100\n we added, you know, the company's been growing\n\n2:07:24.100 --> 2:07:25.740\n and we're not going to go out of business,\n\n2:07:25.740 --> 2:07:27.260\n but we added some sleep stuff\n\n2:07:27.260 --> 2:07:29.780\n and then we added this other function\n\n2:07:29.780 --> 2:07:33.820\n and we have a streak now and we grew 10X\n\n2:07:33.820 --> 2:07:36.860\n in the last, you know, three months.\n\n2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:38.300\n And we're good.\n\n2:07:38.300 --> 2:07:40.220\n You know, I was like, ah, that's nice.\n\n2:07:40.220 --> 2:07:41.060\n It's real nice.\n\n2:07:41.060 --> 2:07:42.900\n It's like, it's a nice feeling when you,\n\n2:07:42.900 --> 2:07:44.140\n well, because so many of them die.\n\n2:07:44.140 --> 2:07:45.940\n We talked about that J curve early.\n\n2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:47.260\n Imagine it's like,\n\n2:07:49.220 --> 2:07:51.700\n it's like all these baby turtles going out to the ocean\n\n2:07:51.700 --> 2:07:53.620\n and the seagulls are ripping them to shreds\n\n2:07:53.620 --> 2:07:56.220\n and then the sharks are eating them.\n\n2:07:56.220 --> 2:07:58.740\n But then like a couple of the turtles make it\n\n2:07:58.740 --> 2:08:02.460\n and they become wise old 100 year old turtles, you know?\n\n2:08:02.460 --> 2:08:06.100\n And you're like, yep, I remember when you catched\n\n2:08:06.100 --> 2:08:08.260\n and like all of your brothers and sisters\n\n2:08:08.260 --> 2:08:09.740\n were ripped to shreds by the seagulls\n\n2:08:09.740 --> 2:08:11.460\n and you made it into the water.\n\n2:08:11.460 --> 2:08:13.780\n And then you made it out to the deep water.\n\n2:08:13.780 --> 2:08:14.620\n Pretty great feeling.\n\n2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:17.220\n I think there's no better way to end it.\n\n2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:18.180\n There it is.\n\n2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:20.260\n The talk of the cruelty of life,\n\n2:08:20.260 --> 2:08:22.180\n that suffering that is life\n\n2:08:22.180 --> 2:08:24.060\n and the love amidst the suffering.\n\n2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:26.820\n Jason, I've been a fan of yours for a long time.\n\n2:08:26.820 --> 2:08:30.620\n You're one of the most special people in Silicon Valley.\n\n2:08:30.620 --> 2:08:31.460\n Thanks, Lex.\n\n2:08:31.460 --> 2:08:34.740\n And maybe you'll also call me in one of the rough times.\n\n2:08:34.740 --> 2:08:36.220\n I'm sure there'll be many.\n\n2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:37.940\n There will be, yeah.\n\n2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:41.180\n There's one expression, nobody gets there alone.\n\n2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.540\n Nobody gets there alone.\n\n2:08:42.540 --> 2:08:45.100\n And anybody who thinks that they got there alone\n\n2:08:45.100 --> 2:08:47.060\n is delusional and kidding themselves.\n\n2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:48.980\n And they will at some point wake up and realize,\n\n2:08:48.980 --> 2:08:52.580\n oh shit, there were a lot of people helped me get here.\n\n2:08:52.580 --> 2:08:54.500\n I need to write a couple of gratitude letters.\n\n2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:55.820\n I got a gratitude letter the other day\n\n2:08:55.820 --> 2:08:57.900\n from a friend of mine who I helped.\n\n2:08:57.900 --> 2:08:59.460\n And I was one of the,\n\n2:08:59.460 --> 2:09:02.100\n you know about these gratitude letters people are writing?\n\n2:09:02.100 --> 2:09:07.100\n It turns out Martin Seligman in, was it Authentic Happiness?\n\n2:09:07.940 --> 2:09:10.820\n Anyway, the guy who really studied happiness and joy,\n\n2:09:10.820 --> 2:09:15.100\n turns out one of the greatest amplifiers of joy in your life\n\n2:09:15.100 --> 2:09:17.740\n is to thank somebody for doing something for you.\n\n2:09:17.740 --> 2:09:22.060\n And somebody who I had helped just wrote me a letter\n\n2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:22.980\n and I got in Christmas\n\n2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:24.460\n and I had the stack of Christmas cards\n\n2:09:24.460 --> 2:09:25.580\n and I hadn't opened them.\n\n2:09:25.580 --> 2:09:27.660\n And it's the second week of January\n\n2:09:27.660 --> 2:09:29.980\n and I was just getting to like the last stack\n\n2:09:29.980 --> 2:09:32.660\n and I open it up and I almost missed it.\n\n2:09:32.660 --> 2:09:33.900\n It's incredibly heartwarming letter\n\n2:09:33.900 --> 2:09:37.220\n about how meaningful like certain things I had done\n\n2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:38.900\n to help along the way\n\n2:09:38.900 --> 2:09:41.700\n and how he'd always appreciated my counsel.\n\n2:09:41.700 --> 2:09:46.460\n And I was just like, well, this happened 25 years ago\n\n2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:48.420\n and you wrote this letter now.\n\n2:09:48.420 --> 2:09:50.300\n And it just hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\n2:09:50.300 --> 2:09:53.460\n I was just like, wow, you know, if you're hearing this,\n\n2:09:53.460 --> 2:09:54.660\n there's probably 10 people\n\n2:09:54.660 --> 2:09:58.100\n who are really instrumental in your lives, in your lives.\n\n2:09:58.100 --> 2:10:00.460\n Go ahead and call them on the phone,\n\n2:10:00.460 --> 2:10:02.260\n write them an email or even better,\n\n2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:05.420\n just write a letter and send it to them\n\n2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:07.020\n and just tell them you're thankful.\n\n2:10:07.020 --> 2:10:08.540\n And let me tell you something,\n\n2:10:08.540 --> 2:10:12.340\n the amplification of joy in your life will go a hundred X,\n\n2:10:12.340 --> 2:10:15.420\n a hundred X when you tell somebody you love them\n\n2:10:15.420 --> 2:10:17.020\n and that you really appreciate them\n\n2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:18.580\n and that what they did for you was magical.\n\n2:10:18.580 --> 2:10:21.420\n So just, and you can look it up, gratitude.\n\n2:10:21.420 --> 2:10:23.900\n Gratitude is like one of these incredible forces.\n\n2:10:23.900 --> 2:10:24.740\n Amen.\n\n2:10:24.740 --> 2:10:25.940\n I'm grateful for being on the pod.\n\n2:10:25.940 --> 2:10:29.860\n I'm grateful you wasted all this time with me.\n\n2:10:29.860 --> 2:10:56.860\n I love it.\n\n2:10:59.860 --> 2:11:09.460\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
