  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.840\n The following is a conversation with Carl Hart,\n\n00:02.840 --> 00:04.920\n department chair and professor of psychology\n\n00:04.920 --> 00:06.880\n at Columbia University.\n\n00:06.880 --> 00:10.120\n He's the author of several books on the topic of drugs,\n\n00:10.120 --> 00:14.360\n including his most recent, called Drug Use for Grownups,\n\n00:14.360 --> 00:16.520\n that challenges us to, quote,\n\n00:16.520 --> 00:19.400\n use empirical evidence to guide public policy\n\n00:19.400 --> 00:21.800\n even if it makes us uncomfortable.\n\n00:21.800 --> 00:24.400\n His research on drugs, including hard drugs,\n\n00:24.400 --> 00:28.160\n like heroin and cocaine, challenges much of what we think\n\n00:28.160 --> 00:31.480\n we know about drugs and their role in society.\n\n00:31.480 --> 00:34.120\n His main thesis is that drug addiction\n\n00:34.120 --> 00:36.560\n has less to do with the drugs themselves\n\n00:36.560 --> 00:39.800\n and more to do with cooccurring psychiatric disorders,\n\n00:39.800 --> 00:42.280\n such as depression and schizophrenia,\n\n00:42.280 --> 00:46.120\n and socioeconomic factors, such as unemployment,\n\n00:46.120 --> 00:48.320\n underemployment, and resource deprivation\n\n00:48.320 --> 00:49.840\n within the community.\n\n00:49.840 --> 00:53.480\n In addition, he believes that we should legalize all drugs\n\n00:53.480 --> 00:55.320\n so that if people choose to use them,\n\n00:55.320 --> 00:58.160\n they could do so responsibly and openly\n\n00:58.160 --> 01:02.600\n and get help if needed in a controlled, safe environment.\n\n01:02.600 --> 01:04.680\n His ideas are controversial,\n\n01:04.680 --> 01:07.480\n but are fundamentally grounded in empirical data\n\n01:07.480 --> 01:09.480\n and rigorous scientific studies.\n\n01:09.480 --> 01:12.000\n I don't know if his conclusions are right,\n\n01:12.000 --> 01:14.640\n but they are at least worth thinking about.\n\n01:14.640 --> 01:18.920\n So I ask that you consider these ideas with an open mind\n\n01:18.920 --> 01:21.360\n and as always, make sure you exercise\n\n01:21.360 --> 01:24.120\n your critical thinking skills in making decisions\n\n01:24.120 --> 01:26.440\n about substances you put in your body.\n\n01:26.440 --> 01:30.080\n You are a free thinking being,\n\n01:30.080 --> 01:32.040\n the main character, if you will,\n\n01:32.040 --> 01:35.880\n the hero in a story that's being written by you.\n\n01:35.880 --> 01:37.200\n So at the end of the day,\n\n01:37.200 --> 01:40.160\n you are responsible for the choices you make.\n\n01:40.160 --> 01:42.480\n So choose wisely.\n\n01:42.480 --> 01:44.600\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:44.600 --> 01:46.920\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:46.920 --> 01:48.280\n in the description.\n\n01:48.280 --> 01:52.200\n And now, here's my conversation with Carl Hart.\n\n01:52.200 --> 01:55.760\n I think it is bold and powerful to admit\n\n01:55.760 --> 01:57.400\n to using in your private life\n\n01:57.400 --> 01:59.520\n the drugs that you study in your research,\n\n01:59.520 --> 02:01.200\n including heroin and cocaine.\n\n02:01.200 --> 02:05.680\n So let me ask, what is the experience of taking heroin like?\n\n02:05.680 --> 02:06.640\n What happens to the body?\n\n02:06.640 --> 02:08.920\n What happens to the mind when you take it?\n\n02:08.920 --> 02:11.760\n Well, you know, I take MDMA, cannabis,\n\n02:11.760 --> 02:13.440\n and all the rest of these drugs too.\n\n02:13.440 --> 02:14.880\n I've tried those drugs.\n\n02:15.920 --> 02:18.760\n The experience in the body and the mind,\n\n02:18.760 --> 02:21.600\n I don't really know what people wanna know\n\n02:21.600 --> 02:22.560\n in that regard.\n\n02:22.560 --> 02:24.240\n It's like saying, what is the experience\n\n02:24.240 --> 02:27.760\n of having an orgasm in the body and the mind?\n\n02:27.760 --> 02:31.240\n Or some other sort of event that you really enjoy.\n\n02:32.280 --> 02:34.200\n So I don't really know what people...\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:35.280\n Is that what poetry is for,\n\n02:35.280 --> 02:37.040\n for describing these kinds of experiences?\n\n02:37.040 --> 02:41.240\n I mean, I guess, given MDMA, given psilocybin,\n\n02:41.240 --> 02:42.960\n in the full context of that,\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:45.320\n maybe it's more useful to say,\n\n02:45.320 --> 02:48.960\n what are the differences in experiences\n\n02:48.960 --> 02:50.840\n that your mind goes through?\n\n02:50.840 --> 02:52.840\n Like chemically, biologically.\n\n02:53.760 --> 02:58.760\n So like keeping it strictly to sort of the biology of it\n\n02:59.040 --> 03:01.720\n versus the full environmental human experience.\n\n03:01.720 --> 03:04.720\n Yeah, see, this is a mistake that people make all the time.\n\n03:04.720 --> 03:07.760\n They try to act as if biology\n\n03:07.760 --> 03:10.080\n is the only determinant of drug effects.\n\n03:10.080 --> 03:12.240\n And that's just not how it works.\n\n03:12.240 --> 03:13.600\n You need the environment.\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:15.560\n You need the cage, as they say.\n\n03:15.560 --> 03:17.280\n If you don't have the cage,\n\n03:17.280 --> 03:20.200\n you don't get the full extent of the effects.\n\n03:20.200 --> 03:23.800\n And so like you can take MDMA and have an awful time.\n\n03:23.800 --> 03:27.880\n You can have a time in which you get paranoid and so forth.\n\n03:27.880 --> 03:31.760\n And then you can take that drug under the right conditions\n\n03:31.760 --> 03:34.880\n and it just be like one of the best moments you've ever had.\n\n03:34.880 --> 03:39.480\n It certainly enhanced a number of my relationships.\n\n03:39.480 --> 03:42.040\n But I've also had some times with MDMA\n\n03:42.040 --> 03:43.680\n that haven't been so lovely.\n\n03:43.680 --> 03:46.800\n When the people who you are hanging out with,\n\n03:46.800 --> 03:48.600\n you don't know them, you're distrustful\n\n03:48.600 --> 03:49.960\n and all of those kinds of things.\n\n03:49.960 --> 03:52.800\n So it's important to put context in it.\n\n03:52.800 --> 03:55.840\n Now we can talk about drugs at a biochemical level,\n\n03:55.840 --> 03:57.120\n at a biological level.\n\n03:57.120 --> 03:58.840\n And we kind of do that in this country\n\n03:58.840 --> 04:01.000\n with this fascination with neuroscience.\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:06.040\n And that's an inappropriate kind of fascination\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:07.520\n in the way we talk about it.\n\n04:07.520 --> 04:08.760\n So we can talk about opioids\n\n04:08.760 --> 04:12.360\n and then we can talk about endogenous opioid system\n\n04:12.360 --> 04:13.200\n in the brain.\n\n04:13.200 --> 04:14.760\n We can talk about dopamine\n\n04:14.760 --> 04:17.880\n and other sort of monoamine transmitters\n\n04:17.880 --> 04:20.840\n and what opioids are doing to them.\n\n04:20.840 --> 04:23.160\n And we can do the same thing with MDMA.\n\n04:24.040 --> 04:27.880\n And we won't be any closer to understanding\n\n04:27.880 --> 04:32.880\n the sort of experience that is induced by these drugs.\n\n04:32.960 --> 04:35.320\n Certainly the experience that we all seek.\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:36.400\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n04:36.400 --> 04:38.040\n So getting a positive experience\n\n04:38.040 --> 04:39.360\n or getting a negative experience\n\n04:39.360 --> 04:42.040\n is strongly defined by the environment.\n\n04:42.040 --> 04:44.000\n Strongly dependent upon it.\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:45.920\n But the environment is a very,\n\n04:45.920 --> 04:48.840\n it's a short word that can describe a lot of things.\n\n04:48.840 --> 04:51.880\n So would you say the environment is important\n\n04:51.880 --> 04:55.720\n or the people where you are currently in your life?\n\n04:55.720 --> 04:58.360\n Or is it also dependent on the full trajectory\n\n04:58.360 --> 05:00.640\n of your psychology of your life experiences\n\n05:00.640 --> 05:03.040\n of your parents or the people you came up with\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:04.880\n of the trauma you've experienced\n\n05:04.880 --> 05:07.160\n of the hopes and dreams that were crushed\n\n05:07.160 --> 05:10.880\n or not or the opposite or the success levels\n\n05:10.880 --> 05:11.760\n or all those things.\n\n05:11.760 --> 05:15.600\n Like what are the interesting sort of landscape\n\n05:15.600 --> 05:19.480\n of experiences that contribute to how you actually feel\n\n05:19.480 --> 05:20.440\n when you take a drug?\n\n05:20.440 --> 05:21.400\n Right on.\n\n05:21.400 --> 05:23.160\n So all of those things are important.\n\n05:23.160 --> 05:26.200\n But you know, like if someone had trauma in childhood\n\n05:26.200 --> 05:28.200\n and they did the work and they dealt with it\n\n05:28.200 --> 05:30.520\n that's not so important in this case.\n\n05:30.520 --> 05:31.760\n But if they didn't deal with it\n\n05:31.760 --> 05:34.880\n and that trauma is being triggered in that event\n\n05:34.880 --> 05:38.120\n in that moment, then it's important.\n\n05:38.120 --> 05:40.840\n But let's just take somebody like me.\n\n05:40.840 --> 05:42.000\n I'm 54 years old.\n\n05:42.000 --> 05:43.640\n I'll be 55 this month actually.\n\n05:43.640 --> 05:47.040\n And you know, I've done a lot of work\n\n05:47.040 --> 05:50.080\n in terms of figuring out who I am\n\n05:50.080 --> 05:52.600\n and I'm comfortable with myself.\n\n05:52.600 --> 05:57.600\n And I know how to set limits for whatever it is I'm doing.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:02.040\n And so I know I need to work out.\n\n06:02.040 --> 06:03.480\n I know I need to eat well.\n\n06:03.480 --> 06:05.240\n I know I need to sleep well.\n\n06:05.240 --> 06:07.840\n I know I need to be in an environment\n\n06:07.840 --> 06:10.880\n with people within my trust.\n\n06:10.880 --> 06:13.160\n And then if all of those things are met,\n\n06:13.160 --> 06:16.560\n oh, it's likely to be a good time.\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:17.400\n You know what I'm saying?\n\n06:17.400 --> 06:20.000\n But if I haven't slept, if I haven't worked out,\n\n06:20.000 --> 06:23.400\n if I don't feel good, it won't be a good time.\n\n06:23.400 --> 06:25.840\n But I try and be responsible\n\n06:25.840 --> 06:30.840\n and take care of my eating habits, sleeping habits,\n\n06:30.920 --> 06:34.080\n make sure my responsibilities are taken care of.\n\n06:34.080 --> 06:39.080\n And so when I'm in that moment, I just enjoy that moment.\n\n06:39.080 --> 06:39.920\n I'm there.\n\n06:39.920 --> 06:42.880\n I'm not thinking about a bill that I didn't pay.\n\n06:42.880 --> 06:46.760\n I'm not thinking about, oh, I forgot to do this for my kid.\n\n06:46.760 --> 06:47.840\n I'm not thinking about that\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:49.760\n because all of those things are taken care of.\n\n06:49.760 --> 06:53.080\n If they're not taken care of, it will impact the experience\n\n06:53.080 --> 06:55.520\n and it may negatively impact the experience.\n\n06:57.640 --> 06:59.480\n Well, that is the counterintuitive,\n\n06:59.480 --> 07:03.040\n even controversial finding from your recent book.\n\n07:03.040 --> 07:06.840\n So we should kind of, I know it seems obvious to you,\n\n07:06.840 --> 07:08.640\n but I think a lot of people hearing this\n\n07:08.640 --> 07:11.120\n would think it's quite non obvious.\n\n07:11.120 --> 07:15.360\n So in your new book, Drug Use for Grownups,\n\n07:15.360 --> 07:18.000\n you write for the finding section.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.480\n I discovered that the predominant effects produced\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:24.160\n by the drugs discussed in this book are positive.\n\n07:24.160 --> 07:27.320\n It didn't matter whether the drug in question was cannabis,\n\n07:27.320 --> 07:31.360\n cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or psilocybin.\n\n07:31.360 --> 07:35.280\n Overwhelmingly, consumers expressed feeling more altruistic,\n\n07:35.280 --> 07:39.320\n empathetic, euphoric, focused, grateful, and tranquil.\n\n07:39.320 --> 07:41.840\n They also experienced enhanced social interactions,\n\n07:41.840 --> 07:43.640\n a great sense of purpose and meaning,\n\n07:43.640 --> 07:46.320\n and increased sexual intimacy and performance.\n\n07:46.320 --> 07:49.480\n This constellation of findings\n\n07:49.480 --> 07:52.960\n challenged my original beliefs about drugs and their effects.\n\n07:52.960 --> 07:55.560\n I had been indoctrinated to be biased\n\n07:55.560 --> 07:57.520\n toward the negative effects of drug use.\n\n07:57.520 --> 08:00.040\n But over the past two plus decades,\n\n08:00.040 --> 08:03.000\n I had gained a deeper, more nuanced understanding.\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:08.000\n These words are very counterintuitive to a lot of people.\n\n08:09.400 --> 08:12.800\n I think like you also mentioned in the book and elsewhere,\n\n08:12.800 --> 08:15.560\n people have come around to maybe psilocybin\n\n08:16.720 --> 08:20.680\n being one such drug, maybe cannabis being one such drug,\n\n08:20.680 --> 08:22.440\n but you also mentioned other drugs\n\n08:22.440 --> 08:24.720\n like cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine.\n\n08:26.520 --> 08:28.760\n Can you just linger on this point?\n\n08:28.760 --> 08:33.040\n How do we get the positive effects of those drugs\n\n08:33.040 --> 08:34.520\n and why in the media,\n\n08:34.520 --> 08:36.840\n and the general conception we have of these drugs\n\n08:36.840 --> 08:41.480\n is that they were going to make a bad life worse\n\n08:41.480 --> 08:43.360\n or ruin a good life?\n\n08:43.360 --> 08:44.920\n Well, so your first question was,\n\n08:44.920 --> 08:47.560\n how do we harness the positive effects?\n\n08:47.560 --> 08:49.880\n How do we increase the likelihood\n\n08:49.880 --> 08:51.120\n of getting the positive effects?\n\n08:51.120 --> 08:53.000\n Again, like I said,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:55.640\n we wanna make sure that people are responsible\n\n08:55.640 --> 08:57.760\n and they've handled their responsibilities,\n\n08:57.760 --> 09:00.240\n make sure they eat well, sleep well, exercise,\n\n09:00.240 --> 09:03.240\n all of those sorts of things play an important role.\n\n09:03.240 --> 09:06.280\n And also if they know exactly what they're getting\n\n09:06.280 --> 09:08.320\n and then they're not paranoid about,\n\n09:08.320 --> 09:13.320\n it's something contaminated in some adulterant in my drug.\n\n09:13.640 --> 09:16.080\n So you wanna make sure you know exactly what you have.\n\n09:16.080 --> 09:18.800\n Once you satisfy those kinds of things,\n\n09:18.800 --> 09:20.960\n you understand the dose and potency,\n\n09:20.960 --> 09:22.480\n you understand all of those things\n\n09:22.480 --> 09:25.560\n to decrease any sort of anxiety you might have\n\n09:25.560 --> 09:29.040\n about the substance itself, it increases the likelihood\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:30.600\n that you will have a better time.\n\n09:30.600 --> 09:33.160\n So anxiety is a big one, you need to remove the anxiety.\n\n09:33.160 --> 09:36.640\n Anxiety is critical, it's huge.\n\n09:36.640 --> 09:39.400\n Many of the negative effects that we see with drugs\n\n09:39.400 --> 09:41.280\n have to do with anxiety\n\n09:41.280 --> 09:44.600\n and not necessarily anxiety because a drug induced it,\n\n09:44.600 --> 09:49.160\n it's the anxiety that the situation induced a lot of times.\n\n09:49.160 --> 09:50.200\n And then you ask like,\n\n09:50.200 --> 09:53.360\n well, why does this sound counterintuitive?\n\n09:53.360 --> 09:58.360\n Why does the media report differently?\n\n09:59.040 --> 10:01.160\n Well, because there's money in reporting\n\n10:01.160 --> 10:04.280\n the negative effects almost exclusively.\n\n10:04.280 --> 10:08.280\n Think about writing a newspaper article.\n\n10:08.280 --> 10:11.640\n It's really easy to get the population all ginned up\n\n10:11.640 --> 10:14.960\n about something like an opioid crisis, overdoses,\n\n10:14.960 --> 10:17.640\n and you don't even have to tell people\n\n10:17.640 --> 10:20.960\n how to keep people safe if you're talking about overdose.\n\n10:20.960 --> 10:23.720\n You don't even have to say why people are dying\n\n10:23.720 --> 10:24.720\n from overdoses.\n\n10:24.720 --> 10:27.600\n Like overdoses in our country happen largely\n\n10:27.600 --> 10:30.200\n because people get contaminated drugs,\n\n10:30.200 --> 10:33.360\n because people are combining sedatives\n\n10:33.360 --> 10:36.080\n and they don't know that this enhances\n\n10:36.080 --> 10:38.640\n the respiratory depressing effects of drugs.\n\n10:38.640 --> 10:39.560\n They don't know.\n\n10:39.560 --> 10:41.960\n But when you read these newspaper articles,\n\n10:41.960 --> 10:43.240\n they don't say this.\n\n10:43.240 --> 10:45.600\n They don't say how to keep people safe.\n\n10:45.600 --> 10:48.640\n All they do is frighten the population.\n\n10:48.640 --> 10:49.480\n There's money in that.\n\n10:49.480 --> 10:53.000\n And then we think about people who write TV shows,\n\n10:54.120 --> 10:56.440\n the people who write movies.\n\n10:56.440 --> 11:01.120\n Most of the stuff written about drugs is just bullshit.\n\n11:01.120 --> 11:04.000\n I think about, I love going to watch comedians\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:06.200\n and the comedians when they talk about drugs,\n\n11:06.200 --> 11:09.520\n again, most of the things that they say about drugs\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:10.560\n is bullshit.\n\n11:10.560 --> 11:13.640\n I mean, you can say the stupidest things about drugs\n\n11:13.640 --> 11:14.720\n and be believed.\n\n11:14.720 --> 11:19.000\n You can write a movie and you don't even have\n\n11:19.000 --> 11:20.720\n to develop your characters.\n\n11:20.720 --> 11:23.200\n If you throw drugs into the mix, you say,\n\n11:23.200 --> 11:24.520\n oh, he's a drug dealer.\n\n11:24.520 --> 11:25.960\n You don't have to say anything\n\n11:25.960 --> 11:27.200\n about that person's background\n\n11:27.200 --> 11:31.280\n or about that person being developed as a character\n\n11:31.280 --> 11:33.520\n because the population think they know.\n\n11:33.520 --> 11:37.000\n And the writer is lazy\n\n11:37.000 --> 11:39.520\n and does not do any sort of development.\n\n11:39.520 --> 11:41.720\n Just think about any more.\n\n11:42.720 --> 11:45.760\n Oh, let's think about the Sopranos, for example.\n\n11:45.760 --> 11:48.240\n They have a new program coming out.\n\n11:48.240 --> 11:50.360\n So let's think about them for a second.\n\n11:50.360 --> 11:54.840\n The Sopranos is a show in which the lead character,\n\n11:54.840 --> 11:57.360\n Tony, kills people for a living.\n\n11:57.360 --> 11:58.760\n That's what he does, right?\n\n11:59.920 --> 12:04.920\n This character actually made a sympathetic for him\n\n12:05.480 --> 12:10.480\n when he is besmirching and denigrating his nephew,\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:13.200\n Christopher, for using a drug.\n\n12:13.200 --> 12:17.760\n And we feel sympathy for Tony, the character,\n\n12:17.760 --> 12:22.520\n who just killed somebody, who is a horrible person,\n\n12:22.520 --> 12:26.760\n but being a drug user is a worse person.\n\n12:26.760 --> 12:28.760\n That's what the show wants us to believe.\n\n12:28.760 --> 12:32.840\n Tony's a racist, murderer, all of these things,\n\n12:32.840 --> 12:34.320\n but we feel sympathy for him.\n\n12:34.320 --> 12:38.120\n But we don't feel sympathy for anyone who uses drugs.\n\n12:38.120 --> 12:39.600\n That's some crazy shit.\n\n12:39.600 --> 12:42.400\n I mean, and the American public buys into it.\n\n12:42.400 --> 12:44.640\n That is, that's wild to me,\n\n12:44.640 --> 12:47.040\n and that we all bought into this crap.\n\n12:47.040 --> 12:50.520\n And that's what we do in damn near everything\n\n12:50.520 --> 12:52.840\n that's in film, on television.\n\n12:52.840 --> 12:55.960\n And it's like, what's wrong with you people?\n\n12:55.960 --> 12:59.680\n So why aren't there not more stories\n\n12:59.680 --> 13:03.080\n of grownups using drugs?\n\n13:03.080 --> 13:05.400\n The full spectrum of drugs that we're talking about.\n\n13:05.400 --> 13:06.520\n Why isn't there?\n\n13:06.520 --> 13:09.040\n So we talked offline about Joe Rogan.\n\n13:09.040 --> 13:12.480\n He's somebody who started smoking weed later in life,\n\n13:12.480 --> 13:13.560\n which is an interesting story.\n\n13:13.560 --> 13:16.040\n Like when he's already very successful\n\n13:16.040 --> 13:17.320\n and he has a very interesting way\n\n13:17.320 --> 13:19.160\n of describing his experience with weed,\n\n13:19.160 --> 13:22.280\n that it was like enhancing just productivity.\n\n13:22.280 --> 13:23.400\n It actually, I think he says,\n\n13:23.400 --> 13:25.200\n like it increases anxiety a little bit\n\n13:25.200 --> 13:29.480\n in a way that was productive, like paranoia, not anxiety.\n\n13:29.480 --> 13:32.320\n And so that's an interesting story of an adult\n\n13:32.320 --> 13:36.880\n talking about the use of weed for productivity purposes.\n\n13:36.880 --> 13:39.080\n But you don't get those stories very often.\n\n13:39.080 --> 13:39.920\n Why?\n\n13:40.960 --> 13:41.960\n I think fear.\n\n13:41.960 --> 13:46.600\n People are afraid that they will be belittled, dismissed,\n\n13:46.600 --> 13:48.360\n all of these things, that's a drug addict\n\n13:48.360 --> 13:51.240\n or some negative thing, but cannabis is lightweight.\n\n13:51.240 --> 13:54.560\n Come on, you can admit cannabis these days.\n\n13:54.560 --> 13:58.360\n And the fact that I don't know when Joe started,\n\n13:58.360 --> 14:01.440\n but if he did start later in life, that's cool.\n\n14:01.440 --> 14:04.920\n I mean, you are mature, developed,\n\n14:04.920 --> 14:08.800\n you have developed some responsibility skills,\n\n14:08.800 --> 14:09.960\n all of these kinds of things.\n\n14:09.960 --> 14:12.080\n This is a good thing.\n\n14:12.080 --> 14:17.080\n You don't want people to engage in any kind of behaviors\n\n14:17.160 --> 14:19.200\n when they're young and immature\n\n14:19.200 --> 14:21.720\n that might put them in harm's way.\n\n14:21.720 --> 14:26.640\n And so we want people to be developed at least.\n\n14:26.640 --> 14:31.640\n I mean, whether it's being in a relationship with a partner\n\n14:32.800 --> 14:35.520\n or whether it's driving an automobile,\n\n14:35.520 --> 14:38.160\n all of these things that can be potentially harmful,\n\n14:38.160 --> 14:40.800\n but extremely beneficial\n\n14:40.800 --> 14:43.120\n if you are responsible enough to handle them.\n\n14:44.000 --> 14:46.720\n You want people to be mature, so that's a good thing.\n\n14:46.720 --> 14:49.920\n So how are you supposed to, like somebody like me,\n\n14:49.920 --> 14:52.760\n somebody like Joe, how are you supposed to understand\n\n14:52.760 --> 14:55.240\n what the dangers are, what the negative effects are?\n\n14:55.240 --> 14:58.240\n So you said automobile, relationships.\n\n14:59.240 --> 15:03.520\n I think I have a reasonably, it's crappy,\n\n15:03.520 --> 15:06.400\n but reasonable understanding of all the troubles\n\n15:06.400 --> 15:09.800\n I can get with in relationships and what things to avoid.\n\n15:09.800 --> 15:11.640\n Same thing with driving a car.\n\n15:11.640 --> 15:12.880\n I have no idea.\n\n15:12.880 --> 15:16.960\n I'm in the dark in terms of what are the things\n\n15:16.960 --> 15:21.600\n to be careful about, what to avoid with drug use\n\n15:21.600 --> 15:24.080\n when we're talking about the heavy drugs.\n\n15:24.080 --> 15:25.880\n Have you ever drank alcohol?\n\n15:25.880 --> 15:26.720\n Yes.\n\n15:26.720 --> 15:27.560\n That's drug use.\n\n15:27.560 --> 15:28.840\n I know, I drank a lot.\n\n15:28.840 --> 15:31.880\n But I understand that because culturally I came up,\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:35.880\n I was taught a lot of like, this is what you don't do\n\n15:35.880 --> 15:37.320\n and this is what you do.\n\n15:37.320 --> 15:38.640\n This is when you drink a lot.\n\n15:38.640 --> 15:40.760\n I mean, you see the effects, you see the,\n\n15:40.760 --> 15:42.280\n there's a lot of negative examples,\n\n15:42.280 --> 15:45.080\n there's positive examples of social stimulant.\n\n15:45.080 --> 15:49.240\n There's examples of great artists using alcohol\n\n15:49.240 --> 15:52.960\n to sort of, I don't know, to help be the catalyst\n\n15:52.960 --> 15:55.840\n for that magic moment, for all of that.\n\n15:55.840 --> 15:59.480\n I have some examples now, especially in America,\n\n15:59.480 --> 16:02.320\n the same with weed, more and more you're starting\n\n16:02.320 --> 16:07.200\n to get a lot of stories of psychedelics of different kinds.\n\n16:07.200 --> 16:12.200\n There's psilocybin where you have mushrooms\n\n16:12.280 --> 16:15.400\n or even MDMA used sort of positively.\n\n16:15.400 --> 16:19.680\n There's kind of like negative stories from the past\n\n16:19.680 --> 16:22.720\n about acid, about LSD being used,\n\n16:22.720 --> 16:26.760\n ultimately for productive ends,\n\n16:26.760 --> 16:28.040\n but it destroyed the person.\n\n16:28.040 --> 16:29.480\n That's kind of how the story goes.\n\n16:29.480 --> 16:30.880\n It was like a trade off.\n\n16:30.880 --> 16:33.560\n You take, it's like, what is it?\n\n16:33.560 --> 16:36.760\n Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil to learn guitar.\n\n16:36.760 --> 16:37.800\n Like it's a trade off.\n\n16:37.800 --> 16:40.160\n You can take the drug, you're gonna create some good stuff,\n\n16:40.160 --> 16:41.440\n but you have to pay for it.\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:42.440\n Those are the stories.\n\n16:42.440 --> 16:45.120\n That's some bullshit we tell children, come on.\n\n16:45.120 --> 16:46.320\n That's exactly right.\n\n16:46.320 --> 16:47.360\n You're exactly right.\n\n16:47.360 --> 16:49.760\n These fairy tales, these cautionary tales\n\n16:49.760 --> 16:52.840\n that we tell people, we have to grow up.\n\n16:52.840 --> 16:56.360\n That's what the book is about, drug use for grownups.\n\n16:56.360 --> 17:01.360\n We tell people, Pinocchio, if you lie, your nose grow.\n\n17:02.320 --> 17:03.160\n Who believes that?\n\n17:03.160 --> 17:04.760\n Who believes that there are fairy tales?\n\n17:04.760 --> 17:06.800\n But that's exactly what these stories are.\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:11.040\n They're in the same vein as those kind of stories,\n\n17:11.040 --> 17:11.880\n as Pinocchio.\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:16.240\n Like you said, when you were learning about alcohol,\n\n17:16.240 --> 17:20.240\n you were told what to do, what not to do, so forth.\n\n17:20.240 --> 17:24.680\n The same can be true with MDMA, with cocaine, with heroin.\n\n17:24.680 --> 17:28.360\n The same is true, because there are some times\n\n17:28.360 --> 17:32.200\n when there are some potential dangers that you should avoid.\n\n17:32.200 --> 17:34.920\n And I wrote about some of them,\n\n17:36.040 --> 17:39.320\n certainly in my work, just throughout all of my writings.\n\n17:39.320 --> 17:40.800\n I talk about those kinds of things\n\n17:40.800 --> 17:43.040\n and other people talk about these things.\n\n17:43.040 --> 17:47.920\n The problem is, is that we're getting our education\n\n17:47.920 --> 17:51.920\n from bullshit sources, from people who believe\n\n17:51.920 --> 17:54.840\n in this kind of Pinocchio thing.\n\n17:54.840 --> 17:58.120\n And it just does not fit with the evidence.\n\n17:58.120 --> 18:01.960\n And the evidence we all publish in the scientific literature,\n\n18:01.960 --> 18:04.160\n all these things that I'm saying,\n\n18:04.160 --> 18:05.840\n it's there in the literature.\n\n18:05.840 --> 18:07.840\n I mean, at a place like Columbia,\n\n18:07.840 --> 18:12.840\n we give these drugs thousands of doses every year.\n\n18:13.360 --> 18:15.840\n Do you think we would be doing this?\n\n18:15.840 --> 18:18.200\n And we do this with research grants\n\n18:18.200 --> 18:22.400\n that's funded by the public, taxpayers dollars.\n\n18:22.400 --> 18:25.240\n Do you think we would be allowed to do this\n\n18:25.240 --> 18:28.040\n if these drugs were so dangerous?\n\n18:29.040 --> 18:30.920\n It's just nonsense.\n\n18:30.920 --> 18:33.360\n I mean, and the drugs we're talking about,\n\n18:33.360 --> 18:37.320\n they are all approved for medical use\n\n18:37.320 --> 18:38.960\n somewhere in the world.\n\n18:40.400 --> 18:42.680\n And the studies you conduct are basically\n\n18:42.680 --> 18:44.520\n asking what kinds of questions.\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:49.160\n So you take the full range of drugs you're talking about\n\n18:49.160 --> 18:53.680\n from marijuana to psilocybin to MDMA to cocaine and heroin.\n\n18:53.680 --> 18:55.000\n What is the study looking at?\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:56.920\n Like what the actual experience with the positive\n\n18:56.920 --> 18:59.560\n and negative effects of the experience on the drug are\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:01.200\n in the control conditions.\n\n19:01.200 --> 19:05.280\n Yeah, so we did these kinds of experiments with alcohol,\n\n19:05.280 --> 19:08.520\n nicotine, all these drugs in order to have\n\n19:08.520 --> 19:12.120\n an empirical database to tell people\n\n19:12.120 --> 19:15.040\n exactly what these drugs do and what they don't do.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:17.640\n The conditions under which the drugs\n\n19:17.640 --> 19:19.240\n will produce positive effects,\n\n19:19.240 --> 19:21.880\n the conditions under which the drugs were more likely\n\n19:21.880 --> 19:23.680\n to produce negative effects.\n\n19:23.680 --> 19:28.040\n All of this information is important for society to know.\n\n19:28.040 --> 19:31.920\n And we do know, and that's why we're collecting the data.\n\n19:31.920 --> 19:35.920\n We're collecting the data to help us with treatment\n\n19:35.920 --> 19:38.720\n if someone is having problems with these data.\n\n19:38.720 --> 19:43.720\n Hopefully we'll understand more about how to help them\n\n19:45.720 --> 19:48.640\n deal with their problems based on some of the research\n\n19:48.640 --> 19:49.480\n that we're doing.\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:51.960\n So what kind of negative effects are we looking out for?\n\n19:51.960 --> 19:53.880\n Like what are the properties of drugs\n\n19:53.880 --> 19:55.000\n we should be careful about?\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:56.680\n Is it addictive properties?\n\n19:56.680 --> 20:01.000\n How addictive it is, how destructive or painful,\n\n20:01.000 --> 20:06.000\n whatever the withdrawal processes,\n\n20:06.000 --> 20:07.960\n what kind of things are we looking out for?\n\n20:07.960 --> 20:09.760\n Yeah, those are certain kind of questions\n\n20:09.760 --> 20:12.760\n we certainly have asked because like something like\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:16.720\n crack cocaine versus alcohol or heroin\n\n20:16.720 --> 20:20.560\n when it comes to withdrawal of physical dependence.\n\n20:20.560 --> 20:24.920\n Like cocaine has a very limited sort of withdrawal symptoms.\n\n20:24.920 --> 20:26.720\n I mean, it's hard to see.\n\n20:26.720 --> 20:28.040\n Same is true with methamphetamine.\n\n20:28.040 --> 20:32.040\n But with heroin, you certainly can see a withdrawal syndrome\n\n20:32.040 --> 20:36.960\n that's unpleasant, but with alcohol that withdrawal\n\n20:36.960 --> 20:39.040\n can actually kill you.\n\n20:39.040 --> 20:42.400\n So heroin is unpleasant and not lovely,\n\n20:42.400 --> 20:44.560\n but with alcohol withdrawal, that's the one,\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:45.760\n that's the most dangerous.\n\n20:45.760 --> 20:47.560\n I mean, all of these kind of questions\n\n20:47.560 --> 20:50.800\n we wanna know answers to.\n\n20:50.800 --> 20:55.440\n And so when we think about heroin or some other drugs\n\n20:55.440 --> 20:57.880\n and you say like, what kind of negative effects?\n\n20:57.880 --> 21:00.920\n Negative effects, we don't talk about much in the society.\n\n21:00.920 --> 21:02.800\n The main thing that really concerns me\n\n21:02.800 --> 21:06.240\n about like heroin use really is constipation.\n\n21:06.240 --> 21:11.200\n So if people are using heroin on a regular basis\n\n21:11.200 --> 21:16.200\n and then they have a sort of slowing of their gut modality,\n\n21:16.480 --> 21:20.640\n they're likely to increase constipation and that's not good.\n\n21:20.640 --> 21:22.920\n I mean, for your general health,\n\n21:22.920 --> 21:25.640\n but we never talk about that in this society.\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:28.800\n And that's probably the most important thing\n\n21:28.800 --> 21:32.680\n aside from the fact that people get contaminated street drugs\n\n21:32.680 --> 21:34.800\n and that sort of stuff and increase the likelihood\n\n21:34.800 --> 21:37.480\n of maybe dying from some contaminant\n\n21:37.480 --> 21:40.200\n or people who are inexperienced\n\n21:40.200 --> 21:42.600\n and they're mixing heroin with other sedatives.\n\n21:42.600 --> 21:46.840\n That's not good, but the constipation is a huge one.\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:51.000\n And then other sort of drugs, negative effects\n\n21:51.960 --> 21:54.920\n like the amphetamines, all of the amphetamines,\n\n21:54.920 --> 21:56.840\n they disrupt sleep, food intake,\n\n21:56.840 --> 21:59.480\n all of these things are so critical\n\n21:59.480 --> 22:02.960\n for sustaining human life, but we never talk about that\n\n22:02.960 --> 22:05.880\n because it's not as sexy as this nonsense\n\n22:05.880 --> 22:08.120\n that people write about like addiction.\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:10.080\n Addiction has almost nothing to do\n\n22:10.080 --> 22:11.480\n with the drugs themselves.\n\n22:11.480 --> 22:16.720\n And I make that comment because the vast majority of users\n\n22:16.720 --> 22:19.600\n for any drug never become addicted.\n\n22:19.600 --> 22:23.040\n And so if the vast majority of users don't become addicted,\n\n22:23.040 --> 22:25.200\n then you have to move beyond the drug\n\n22:25.200 --> 22:27.560\n when you're talking about the phenomenon interest\n\n22:27.560 --> 22:29.320\n in this case, addiction.\n\n22:29.320 --> 22:31.560\n And so when we think about addiction,\n\n22:31.560 --> 22:35.080\n it has much more to do with our psychosocial environment\n\n22:35.080 --> 22:38.520\n than the drug itself, but that's not sexy.\n\n22:38.520 --> 22:41.280\n So addiction is even the property of the environment,\n\n22:41.280 --> 22:44.320\n not a property, a result of the environment.\n\n22:44.320 --> 22:45.320\n It certainly can be.\n\n22:45.320 --> 22:47.760\n There are people who are suffering\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:52.760\n from cooccurring mental illness like depression, anxiety.\n\n22:52.800 --> 22:55.440\n I mean, that's within the person, of course,\n\n22:55.440 --> 22:57.920\n and that increases the likelihood for addiction.\n\n22:57.920 --> 23:01.440\n So that's not so much the environment,\n\n23:01.440 --> 23:03.640\n but there are people who, for example,\n\n23:03.640 --> 23:07.800\n they have chronic unrealistic expectations heaped on them.\n\n23:07.800 --> 23:09.800\n And those people are more likely\n\n23:09.800 --> 23:12.000\n to have some problems with drugs.\n\n23:12.000 --> 23:14.360\n There are people who are just immature,\n\n23:14.360 --> 23:18.280\n not having developed responsibility skills.\n\n23:18.280 --> 23:20.640\n They are likely to have some problems\n\n23:20.640 --> 23:23.640\n if they engage in some of these behaviors.\n\n23:23.640 --> 23:27.120\n There are people who lost their jobs, COVID,\n\n23:27.120 --> 23:30.080\n factories went away, a wide range of things.\n\n23:30.080 --> 23:33.560\n And those people used to have standing in their community.\n\n23:33.560 --> 23:35.520\n Now they have none.\n\n23:35.520 --> 23:37.680\n Those people might be susceptible\n\n23:37.680 --> 23:41.240\n to having a drug related problem if they indulge.\n\n23:41.240 --> 23:44.400\n All of these kinds of issues are far more important\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:45.560\n than the drug itself.\n\n23:46.480 --> 23:48.560\n And so they could seek escape in a particular drug.\n\n23:48.560 --> 23:51.320\n I mean, there is a biochemical thing\n\n23:51.320 --> 23:52.400\n to each of these drugs,\n\n23:52.400 --> 23:55.280\n and some pull you in harder than others\n\n23:55.280 --> 23:56.960\n when you need the escape, right?\n\n23:56.960 --> 23:58.880\n When you're not doing well in life.\n\n23:58.880 --> 24:00.200\n What evidence you have for that bullshit?\n\n24:00.200 --> 24:01.040\n I don't.\n\n24:01.040 --> 24:02.000\n Yeah, because there is none.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.760\n There is absolutely none.\n\n24:03.760 --> 24:06.800\n I mean, people say stuff like that,\n\n24:06.800 --> 24:09.520\n and that's the problem.\n\n24:09.520 --> 24:11.480\n That's precisely the problem.\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:14.840\n See, I'm operating from limited personal evidence.\n\n24:14.840 --> 24:16.160\n Well, this is a problem though,\n\n24:16.160 --> 24:18.680\n but we have a scientific database.\n\n24:18.680 --> 24:21.240\n We don't need personal evidence for this.\n\n24:21.240 --> 24:24.600\n We have, in my book, I try to go through some of the science\n\n24:24.600 --> 24:26.480\n so people could understand.\n\n24:26.480 --> 24:29.840\n It's like when you have a math problem,\n\n24:29.840 --> 24:31.000\n you don't want people saying,\n\n24:31.000 --> 24:32.760\n well, you know, I feel like this.\n\n24:32.760 --> 24:33.960\n Fuck what you feel.\n\n24:33.960 --> 24:35.960\n What does the data say?\n\n24:35.960 --> 24:38.480\n So one of the problems with the data,\n\n24:38.480 --> 24:41.800\n so one data is there's the studies that you're doing,\n\n24:41.800 --> 24:43.240\n this is excellent research work,\n\n24:43.240 --> 24:45.560\n but there's some of the drugs that are illegal.\n\n24:45.560 --> 24:46.960\n Yes. And some are legal.\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:49.200\n So you have just,\n\n24:50.400 --> 24:53.160\n it's unfortunate that some of the drugs are illegal\n\n24:53.160 --> 24:54.920\n or whatever you believe,\n\n24:54.920 --> 24:57.600\n but there's not enough of a data set of public\n\n24:57.600 --> 24:58.800\n and the open use.\n\n24:58.800 --> 25:01.440\n That's like you got in the wild data set.\n\n25:01.440 --> 25:03.920\n It'd be nice to do, you know, thousands of people\n\n25:03.920 --> 25:06.080\n and see from all the different kinds of environments\n\n25:06.080 --> 25:08.520\n and all that kind of stuff to get an understanding.\n\n25:08.520 --> 25:13.240\n I think we have a substantial database,\n\n25:13.240 --> 25:15.320\n but people just ignore it.\n\n25:15.320 --> 25:16.160\n Got it.\n\n25:17.120 --> 25:21.440\n That said, let me ask you the question of legalization.\n\n25:21.440 --> 25:26.200\n So should, in your view, all drugs be legalized?\n\n25:26.200 --> 25:27.920\n The drugs that people seek\n\n25:27.920 --> 25:30.480\n certainly should be legally regulated\n\n25:30.480 --> 25:32.400\n and available to adults.\n\n25:32.400 --> 25:33.960\n So when I say the drugs people seek,\n\n25:33.960 --> 25:38.080\n like cannabis, MDMA, cocaine, heroin,\n\n25:39.840 --> 25:42.280\n those drugs certainly should be available.\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:45.480\n And some of the psychedelics that people seek.\n\n25:45.480 --> 25:50.480\n Now, the thing about it is that some people think that,\n\n25:50.480 --> 25:52.080\n oh, it will be a free fall.\n\n25:52.080 --> 25:54.000\n These drugs are available to everyone.\n\n25:54.000 --> 25:54.880\n That's not true.\n\n25:54.880 --> 25:57.640\n I mean, there will be age requirements\n\n25:57.640 --> 25:59.320\n and maybe other requirements,\n\n25:59.320 --> 26:01.120\n but they should be available.\n\n26:01.120 --> 26:04.480\n And we should also do like what we do with alcohol.\n\n26:04.480 --> 26:08.200\n We can put enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,\n\n26:08.200 --> 26:09.320\n but we don't.\n\n26:09.320 --> 26:13.840\n So we regulate it such that the amount that's in the bottle\n\n26:13.840 --> 26:18.240\n enhances the safety and minimizes the potential harms.\n\n26:18.240 --> 26:20.560\n We can do the same thing with these other drugs.\n\n26:20.560 --> 26:22.880\n And we can also say, okay,\n\n26:22.880 --> 26:25.960\n we won't be selling intravenous preparations\n\n26:25.960 --> 26:27.720\n of any of these drugs.\n\n26:28.760 --> 26:32.640\n The drugs that the routes of administration will be oral\n\n26:32.640 --> 26:36.640\n and I don't know, let's say intranasal.\n\n26:38.160 --> 26:40.720\n Again, routes of administration,\n\n26:40.720 --> 26:43.640\n the dose that you have in each unit,\n\n26:43.640 --> 26:48.640\n all can minimize harm based on how you do these things.\n\n26:49.200 --> 26:50.040\n And we can do that.\n\n26:50.040 --> 26:52.200\n We have the technology, we have the knowhow.\n\n26:53.760 --> 26:55.040\n So you're actually making me think\n\n26:55.040 --> 26:56.120\n about alcohol a little bit.\n\n26:56.120 --> 26:58.760\n So if I were, say the drugs become legalized\n\n26:58.760 --> 27:00.160\n in the way you're describing,\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:04.440\n and me, Lex, wanted to, as an adult,\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:06.360\n explore some of these drugs,\n\n27:06.360 --> 27:10.120\n what are some procedures do you think\n\n27:10.120 --> 27:14.920\n for sort of safe, positive exploration of those drugs?\n\n27:14.920 --> 27:16.840\n The reason I say I'm thinking about alcohol\n\n27:16.840 --> 27:18.280\n because I don't think,\n\n27:18.280 --> 27:22.440\n besides not putting enough alcohol in a bottle to kill you,\n\n27:22.440 --> 27:25.800\n I don't think anyone ever gave me specific instructions.\n\n27:25.800 --> 27:27.280\n I think it's kind of word of mouth\n\n27:27.280 --> 27:30.880\n and examples of people doing the wrong thing.\n\n27:30.880 --> 27:33.960\n You kind of get it through osmosis that way.\n\n27:33.960 --> 27:36.280\n Is that basically what we would do,\n\n27:36.280 --> 27:38.200\n this kind of free exploration of use?\n\n27:38.200 --> 27:41.280\n No, we have to change our education about these things.\n\n27:41.280 --> 27:44.200\n I mean, let's just take a drug like cocaine.\n\n27:44.200 --> 27:45.520\n Cocaine's a stimulant.\n\n27:46.600 --> 27:47.960\n You want to make sure people understand\n\n27:47.960 --> 27:50.400\n that they shouldn't be taking cocaine near bedtime.\n\n27:50.400 --> 27:54.960\n You know, they need to get a certain amount of hours of sleep\n\n27:54.960 --> 27:57.400\n and they need to get up in the morning.\n\n27:57.400 --> 28:00.000\n Cocaine probably isn't a drug for you at night.\n\n28:00.000 --> 28:01.680\n Certainly not.\n\n28:01.680 --> 28:04.600\n Certainly not amphetamines at night for most people.\n\n28:04.600 --> 28:06.840\n And also, if you want to make sure that you,\n\n28:06.840 --> 28:09.520\n they need to understand that cocaine\n\n28:09.520 --> 28:11.800\n can also disrupt your food intake.\n\n28:11.800 --> 28:13.280\n Not as much as the amphetamines,\n\n28:13.280 --> 28:15.800\n but all of these kinds of things people need to know\n\n28:15.800 --> 28:18.440\n so they can have proper nutrition\n\n28:18.440 --> 28:22.480\n and they can time their drug use\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:25.520\n around these other important functions\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:26.880\n that's the same human life.\n\n28:26.880 --> 28:30.920\n So we have to make sure that we educate people.\n\n28:30.920 --> 28:34.400\n We can't just throw people in a while.\n\n28:34.400 --> 28:36.120\n That's stupid.\n\n28:36.120 --> 28:37.920\n I gotta tell you, I mean, for me,\n\n28:37.920 --> 28:40.400\n and even given your book and for people listening to this,\n\n28:40.400 --> 28:44.160\n it's still tough to hear that the thing\n\n28:44.160 --> 28:46.720\n we should be concerned about with cocaine\n\n28:48.520 --> 28:50.560\n is the same as with caffeine.\n\n28:50.560 --> 28:52.000\n Don't take it before bed.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.520\n And the thing we should be concerned with heroin\n\n28:54.520 --> 28:55.440\n is constipation.\n\n28:55.440 --> 28:56.280\n Yeah.\n\n28:58.880 --> 29:00.480\n Okay.\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:04.840\n But the questions I keep wanting to ask you,\n\n29:04.840 --> 29:07.840\n I should be asking the same things of alcohol,\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:10.760\n but when you're not doing well psychologically\n\n29:10.760 --> 29:11.840\n in the ways you describe,\n\n29:11.840 --> 29:13.560\n when the environment is not right,\n\n29:17.120 --> 29:19.760\n there's some aspect in which saying that drugs\n\n29:19.760 --> 29:22.560\n can be used responsibly and effectively\n\n29:22.560 --> 29:27.560\n and mostly positive can give those folks a pass\n\n29:28.360 --> 29:30.600\n to use it instead of working on themselves\n\n29:30.600 --> 29:32.840\n and fixing their environment first.\n\n29:32.840 --> 29:35.280\n I don't know, what do you want me to say to that?\n\n29:35.280 --> 29:37.280\n I mean, they have access to alcohol,\n\n29:37.280 --> 29:38.680\n they have access to the...\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:42.920\n You know, we live in this country called the United States\n\n29:42.920 --> 29:45.280\n where our Declaration of Independence says\n\n29:45.280 --> 29:48.400\n that we are free to live like we wanna live\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:51.240\n so long as we don't disrupt other people\n\n29:51.240 --> 29:52.400\n from doing the same.\n\n29:53.440 --> 29:55.240\n But it's remarkable to me\n\n29:55.240 --> 29:58.080\n how we try to control the behaviors of other people.\n\n29:58.080 --> 30:00.720\n That's just remarkable.\n\n30:00.720 --> 30:01.720\n Yeah.\n\n30:01.720 --> 30:03.800\n And that's partially what your book is about.\n\n30:03.800 --> 30:06.360\n I mean, it's not just about drugs, it's about freedom.\n\n30:06.360 --> 30:09.120\n That's the bigger issue that we can't get to.\n\n30:09.120 --> 30:12.280\n It's like this issue of freedom\n\n30:12.280 --> 30:14.520\n and freedom comes with a tremendous amount\n\n30:14.520 --> 30:15.960\n of responsibility.\n\n30:15.960 --> 30:18.960\n I am responsible for my neighbors, my brothers.\n\n30:18.960 --> 30:22.840\n I mean, I can't impede their freedoms.\n\n30:22.840 --> 30:24.880\n Like some people think that their freedom\n\n30:24.880 --> 30:26.680\n supersedes everybody else's freedoms.\n\n30:26.680 --> 30:27.520\n No.\n\n30:27.520 --> 30:30.920\n And that's what I'm trying to remind people in this book.\n\n30:30.920 --> 30:35.920\n I am responsible to you as a citizen\n\n30:36.800 --> 30:39.520\n and we're in this together.\n\n30:39.520 --> 30:41.960\n And I tried to make that point in the book\n\n30:41.960 --> 30:46.400\n and people have conveniently ignored things like that.\n\n30:47.280 --> 30:49.640\n Do you think the war on drugs\n\n30:49.640 --> 30:52.480\n has done more positive or negative for the world?\n\n30:53.560 --> 30:55.480\n Depends on which world you live in.\n\n30:55.480 --> 30:58.800\n The war on drugs has been hugely beneficial\n\n30:58.800 --> 31:02.720\n to law enforcement, to the media,\n\n31:02.720 --> 31:05.520\n to people who make bullshit TV shows.\n\n31:06.760 --> 31:10.200\n The Sopranos, The Wire, all of those shows,\n\n31:10.200 --> 31:12.800\n they benefit from this kind of nonsense.\n\n31:15.800 --> 31:17.120\n Who else have benefited?\n\n31:17.120 --> 31:19.760\n People who provide treatment,\n\n31:19.760 --> 31:21.840\n many of them benefit from the war on drugs.\n\n31:21.840 --> 31:25.480\n The folks who do urine testing for drugs,\n\n31:25.480 --> 31:26.920\n they've all benefited.\n\n31:26.920 --> 31:28.960\n They're making mad money.\n\n31:28.960 --> 31:31.240\n People who run prisons,\n\n31:31.240 --> 31:35.320\n the phone companies who charge the prisoners,\n\n31:35.320 --> 31:38.640\n the people who run the hotels that are around the prisons\n\n31:38.640 --> 31:41.360\n where people's family have to come and stay,\n\n31:41.360 --> 31:45.840\n the restaurants, they are making out like bandits.\n\n31:45.840 --> 31:48.960\n But many of us are getting screwed as a society.\n\n31:49.960 --> 31:51.440\n In general, we're getting screwed,\n\n31:51.440 --> 31:54.960\n but there are people who are just benefiting handsomely.\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:56.320\n That's why it continues.\n\n31:56.320 --> 31:58.000\n Politicians benefit.\n\n31:58.000 --> 32:00.320\n I mean, whether you're Democrat or Republican,\n\n32:00.320 --> 32:02.640\n you have the same stance on drugs anyway,\n\n32:02.640 --> 32:05.800\n so they all benefit from this.\n\n32:05.800 --> 32:07.520\n So many questions I want to ask you,\n\n32:07.520 --> 32:08.880\n because you're challenging a lot of beliefs\n\n32:08.880 --> 32:13.080\n that people have about drugs, about society in general.\n\n32:13.080 --> 32:16.000\n So it's difficult for me to ask the right questions here.\n\n32:18.000 --> 32:23.000\n If you were with a sort of a snap of a finger,\n\n32:23.000 --> 32:28.000\n change the world, what from a policy perspective would you,\n\n32:28.960 --> 32:33.120\n and from just a, I don't know, human to human perspective,\n\n32:33.120 --> 32:36.200\n what would you like to see in the United States of America\n\n32:36.200 --> 32:37.920\n in terms of if that fixes some of the problems\n\n32:37.920 --> 32:39.040\n we're discussing here?\n\n32:39.040 --> 32:41.920\n First of all, we wouldn't be arresting anybody\n\n32:41.920 --> 32:42.880\n for drugs anymore.\n\n32:42.880 --> 32:45.040\n That would go away.\n\n32:45.040 --> 32:48.440\n The folks who are in prison for drugs, that would go away.\n\n32:48.440 --> 32:52.080\n Their records would be expunged, that would just go away.\n\n32:52.080 --> 32:56.520\n And then we work on a system to make sure\n\n32:56.520 --> 33:01.520\n that responsible adults can legally obtain these substances\n\n33:02.440 --> 33:05.680\n and we'll have a corresponding educational system\n\n33:05.680 --> 33:07.320\n to teach people how to do this.\n\n33:08.800 --> 33:11.040\n That's where I would start initially.\n\n33:12.400 --> 33:15.600\n Yeah, the arresting for drug use\n\n33:15.600 --> 33:18.400\n or anything drug related is absurd,\n\n33:18.400 --> 33:20.920\n especially in the context of hard destructive alcohol\n\n33:20.920 --> 33:22.920\n and tobacco.\n\n33:22.920 --> 33:25.000\n Alcohol can be destructive to some people,\n\n33:25.000 --> 33:28.600\n but alcohol also is a hugely beneficial drug.\n\n33:28.600 --> 33:31.240\n To be honest, which I couldn't have gotten through\n\n33:31.240 --> 33:34.280\n many of the sort of receptions and functions\n\n33:34.280 --> 33:37.640\n I had to go through as the chair of the department\n\n33:37.640 --> 33:38.480\n without alcohol.\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:41.120\n Yeah, you have a line I really liked.\n\n33:41.120 --> 33:44.600\n The vast amount of predictably favorable drug effects\n\n33:44.600 --> 33:47.880\n intrigued me, so much so that I expanded my own drug use\n\n33:47.880 --> 33:49.360\n to take advantage of the wide array\n\n33:49.360 --> 33:52.400\n of beneficial outcome specific drugs can offer.\n\n33:52.400 --> 33:54.640\n The part that entertained me was this.\n\n33:54.640 --> 33:56.160\n To put this in personal terms,\n\n33:56.160 --> 34:00.600\n my position as department chairman from 2016 to 2019\n\n34:00.600 --> 34:02.560\n was far more detrimental to my health\n\n34:02.560 --> 34:04.360\n than my drug use ever was.\n\n34:04.360 --> 34:07.520\n I mean, there is a standard we're treating drugs,\n\n34:07.520 --> 34:10.200\n certain kinds of drugs that's completely different\n\n34:10.200 --> 34:11.600\n than the standard we're treating everything else\n\n34:11.600 --> 34:12.440\n in our lives.\n\n34:13.680 --> 34:17.120\n Yeah, I mean, it's almost difficult to snap out of it\n\n34:17.120 --> 34:19.800\n as I'm listening to you and reading your work.\n\n34:24.280 --> 34:27.000\n It's difficult because it's like,\n\n34:27.000 --> 34:31.800\n why is everybody living this idea that certain drugs\n\n34:31.800 --> 34:35.560\n are so horribly destructive and others are not?\n\n34:35.560 --> 34:37.680\n And we just kind of fix that idea.\n\n34:37.680 --> 34:39.240\n And then there's this narrative,\n\n34:41.120 --> 34:43.600\n I hate to be so cynical to think that there is just\n\n34:43.600 --> 34:46.320\n like a system that just propagates narratives.\n\n34:46.320 --> 34:50.240\n I always kind of think that truth wins out.\n\n34:50.240 --> 34:51.480\n Truth is the best narrative.\n\n34:51.480 --> 34:52.560\n I believe that too.\n\n34:52.560 --> 34:54.920\n Obviously, that's why I'm out here and putting,\n\n34:54.920 --> 34:58.240\n subjecting myself to this sort of criticism and so forth,\n\n34:58.240 --> 35:01.160\n but because I believe that truth ultimately wins out,\n\n35:01.160 --> 35:02.840\n but I might be wrong,\n\n35:02.840 --> 35:07.800\n but I have to live my life like it's true.\n\n35:07.800 --> 35:11.200\n Otherwise, then I have no hope, then why be here?\n\n35:11.200 --> 35:12.840\n Well, kind of, if you can steal man\n\n35:12.840 --> 35:15.520\n or at least show respect to a criticism,\n\n35:15.520 --> 35:19.680\n you've I'm sure received quite a bit of criticism\n\n35:19.680 --> 35:20.640\n for your work.\n\n35:20.640 --> 35:23.760\n I've heard quite a bit of BS criticisms,\n\n35:23.760 --> 35:27.040\n sort of ignorant stuff that don't actually pay attention\n\n35:27.040 --> 35:30.200\n to your work, but is there some serious,\n\n35:30.200 --> 35:34.160\n like is there some pushback that makes you think twice?\n\n35:34.160 --> 35:39.160\n People say like, I'm presenting a too rosy picture of drugs.\n\n35:40.480 --> 35:42.040\n I don't wanna do that.\n\n35:42.040 --> 35:45.600\n I don't want people to think that I'm not aware of the\n\n35:45.600 --> 35:49.280\n potential negative effects of any activity,\n\n35:49.280 --> 35:51.200\n including drug use.\n\n35:51.200 --> 35:56.200\n And so I do acknowledge that there are potential harms\n\n35:56.680 --> 35:57.560\n associated with drugs.\n\n35:57.560 --> 35:59.920\n I acknowledge that in the book,\n\n35:59.920 --> 36:03.560\n but the fact remains the beneficial effects far outweigh\n\n36:03.560 --> 36:05.400\n the potential harmful effects.\n\n36:05.400 --> 36:09.720\n And we have technology information to help people\n\n36:09.720 --> 36:12.200\n to minimize the likelihood of negative effects.\n\n36:12.200 --> 36:16.680\n But this sort of approach that we have where we say\n\n36:16.680 --> 36:20.360\n we're only exclusively presenting the harmful effects\n\n36:20.360 --> 36:23.320\n and that should make people, keep people safe.\n\n36:23.320 --> 36:25.480\n I just have a problem with that.\n\n36:25.480 --> 36:30.480\n But I certainly, I take the point that people say\n\n36:31.160 --> 36:32.200\n there are negative effects.\n\n36:32.200 --> 36:35.160\n Absolutely, I absolutely agree.\n\n36:35.160 --> 36:39.200\n What do you, if I can just talk about specific drugs,\n\n36:39.200 --> 36:42.920\n what's the difference between opioids and benzos,\n\n36:42.920 --> 36:47.440\n for example, specifically, I mean,\n\n36:47.440 --> 36:50.680\n these are drugs that you often read about\n\n36:50.680 --> 36:53.120\n being misused at scale.\n\n36:53.120 --> 36:56.120\n I mean, the misuse is the problem, right?\n\n36:56.120 --> 36:58.320\n No matter what the drug is.\n\n36:58.320 --> 37:00.720\n And that's actually what you're pushing for is education\n\n37:00.720 --> 37:03.720\n and it should be legal and should be good.\n\n37:03.720 --> 37:08.600\n So people should know what's the difference in proper use,\n\n37:08.600 --> 37:10.640\n positive use and misuse.\n\n37:10.640 --> 37:13.960\n I mean, one public figure who has been going through this\n\n37:13.960 --> 37:17.120\n is Jordan Peterson, he's been public about his struggle\n\n37:17.120 --> 37:20.520\n of getting off benzos, the withdrawal he's going through.\n\n37:20.520 --> 37:25.520\n I mean, what are your thoughts about the misuse of benzos\n\n37:25.920 --> 37:30.000\n or opioids and so on, the epidemic that people talk about?\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:33.200\n Yeah, I don't know Jordan's specific case,\n\n37:33.200 --> 37:36.120\n but certainly with benzodiazepines in general,\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:37.680\n we talked about withdrawal earlier.\n\n37:37.680 --> 37:40.120\n When I said that with alcohol withdrawal, you can die.\n\n37:40.120 --> 37:43.480\n So benzos and alcohol, they're closely related.\n\n37:43.480 --> 37:47.360\n So benzo withdrawal too can kill you just like alcohol.\n\n37:47.360 --> 37:49.160\n So when we think about the effects\n\n37:49.160 --> 37:51.280\n that benzodiazepines produce,\n\n37:51.280 --> 37:53.400\n think about the effects that alcohol produce,\n\n37:53.400 --> 37:55.680\n they're comparable or similar.\n\n37:55.680 --> 38:00.680\n And so I know that it's a difficult one to wean yourself off\n\n38:01.360 --> 38:03.400\n if you develop the dependence,\n\n38:03.400 --> 38:08.400\n but we have protocols for that and I hope he's okay.\n\n38:09.560 --> 38:11.280\n It's interesting you say we have protocols for that,\n\n38:11.280 --> 38:13.560\n but from my understanding was that\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:16.080\n like the protocols aren't standardized.\n\n38:16.080 --> 38:19.000\n It feels like a lot of doctors aren't as helpful\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:20.800\n as they could be in this process.\n\n38:20.800 --> 38:22.280\n Like it's a bit of a mess.\n\n38:22.280 --> 38:23.920\n Certainly with withdrawal,\n\n38:23.920 --> 38:27.040\n they're more standardized than anything.\n\n38:27.040 --> 38:30.600\n So like if someone is going through alcohol withdrawal,\n\n38:30.600 --> 38:33.600\n there is a standard protocol that most physicians\n\n38:33.600 --> 38:36.040\n in this business, they follow.\n\n38:36.040 --> 38:39.440\n The same is true with a benzo withdrawal.\n\n38:39.440 --> 38:41.560\n But the thing where it gets murky\n\n38:41.560 --> 38:44.080\n is when they're treating addiction itself.\n\n38:44.080 --> 38:47.840\n So when you're thinking about the substance use disorder\n\n38:47.840 --> 38:51.320\n in the DSM, not just withdrawal, but the entire addiction,\n\n38:51.320 --> 38:56.320\n that's where you have this sort of a divergence\n\n38:56.320 --> 39:00.480\n or diversity in terms of approaches.\n\n39:00.480 --> 39:03.480\n And many of those approaches are rubbish.\n\n39:03.480 --> 39:06.680\n Can you just elaborate like technically\n\n39:06.680 --> 39:09.600\n what the term addiction means that you're referring to?\n\n39:09.600 --> 39:11.000\n When I use the term addiction,\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:16.000\n I'm referring to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual\n\n39:16.400 --> 39:18.680\n of the American Psychiatric Association,\n\n39:18.680 --> 39:20.960\n number five now, the DSM five.\n\n39:20.960 --> 39:22.520\n That's never been wrong, right?\n\n39:24.240 --> 39:25.080\n I'm just kidding.\n\n39:25.080 --> 39:28.080\n You're absolutely, that point is well taken.\n\n39:28.080 --> 39:33.040\n And your point is that their definition\n\n39:33.040 --> 39:35.320\n of substance use disorder, that's addiction.\n\n39:35.320 --> 39:36.520\n That's what I'm talking about.\n\n39:36.520 --> 39:39.640\n But that definition continues to evolve.\n\n39:39.640 --> 39:41.560\n And so you're right.\n\n39:41.560 --> 39:44.120\n They still are working it out.\n\n39:44.120 --> 39:47.240\n We're getting new information from scientific studies\n\n39:47.240 --> 39:48.080\n and so forth.\n\n39:48.080 --> 39:51.560\n And so it's supposed to be incorporated into the DSM,\n\n39:51.560 --> 39:53.960\n but there are some problems with the DSM.\n\n39:53.960 --> 39:58.920\n Like for example, they also have this sort of once an addict,\n\n39:58.920 --> 40:00.560\n always an addict thing.\n\n40:00.560 --> 40:05.200\n And there's no evidence to support that, but it's evolving.\n\n40:05.200 --> 40:09.600\n And it's the definition that people in science\n\n40:09.600 --> 40:10.880\n and medicine use.\n\n40:10.880 --> 40:13.840\n And so we all know we're talking about the same language\n\n40:13.840 --> 40:17.600\n when we call someone a substance use disorder patient\n\n40:17.600 --> 40:19.680\n or someone who meets criteria for addiction.\n\n40:19.680 --> 40:22.200\n We all are speaking the same language.\n\n40:22.200 --> 40:24.800\n We're not saying that simply because this person\n\n40:24.800 --> 40:26.600\n use heroin, they are an addict.\n\n40:26.600 --> 40:28.040\n That's not what we're saying.\n\n40:28.040 --> 40:32.120\n You have to meet these criteria where you have disruptions\n\n40:32.120 --> 40:34.120\n in your psychosocial functioning.\n\n40:34.120 --> 40:35.280\n That's one.\n\n40:35.280 --> 40:39.440\n And two, you, the person are distressed\n\n40:39.440 --> 40:43.160\n by these disruptions.\n\n40:43.160 --> 40:46.520\n So people have to meet those two basic criteria\n\n40:46.520 --> 40:48.680\n before we say they are addicted.\n\n40:48.680 --> 40:53.680\n So once an addict, always an addict, this idea.\n\n40:53.960 --> 40:57.880\n So I've, I mean, some of it is always mapped\n\n40:57.880 --> 40:58.760\n to the person, all right.\n\n40:58.760 --> 41:01.720\n But just the people I've interacted with\n\n41:01.720 --> 41:04.080\n who have struggled with alcohol addiction,\n\n41:04.080 --> 41:06.360\n I don't know what the proper term is.\n\n41:06.360 --> 41:09.080\n It seems like with Alcohol Anonymous,\n\n41:09.080 --> 41:14.080\n the process of putting that addiction behind you\n\n41:14.800 --> 41:16.960\n is a very, very long process.\n\n41:16.960 --> 41:18.800\n It's surprisingly long to me.\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:20.640\n That almost seems like a whole life.\n\n41:20.640 --> 41:24.200\n Like, he's not always an addict, but it takes decades.\n\n41:24.200 --> 41:27.600\n It seems like, what is that?\n\n41:27.600 --> 41:31.440\n What, can you maybe just, from your understanding\n\n41:31.440 --> 41:33.320\n as a scientist, from your understanding as a human\n\n41:33.320 --> 41:36.120\n who studies human nature, why does it take so long\n\n41:36.120 --> 41:41.120\n to treat, to deal with that addiction?\n\n41:42.920 --> 41:46.600\n Well, you cited Alcohol Anonymous, right?\n\n41:46.600 --> 41:49.640\n And so I don't think of Alcohol Anonymous\n\n41:49.640 --> 41:54.400\n as like a treatment that I would send any relative to,\n\n41:54.400 --> 41:57.640\n like for a drug related problem.\n\n41:57.640 --> 42:01.760\n I think Alcohol Anonymous AA is really good\n\n42:01.760 --> 42:06.760\n for social interactions, making sure people\n\n42:07.120 --> 42:10.360\n have a social group and they have peers.\n\n42:10.360 --> 42:11.920\n I mean, that's a good thing.\n\n42:11.920 --> 42:14.720\n We all need that social interaction.\n\n42:14.720 --> 42:16.760\n But I don't think they know much about drugs.\n\n42:16.760 --> 42:21.040\n That's not, it's like saying, well, you know,\n\n42:21.040 --> 42:25.160\n my uncle broke his knee and he has this support group\n\n42:25.160 --> 42:30.160\n and they said this, and then we follow that.\n\n42:30.840 --> 42:31.960\n That doesn't make any sense.\n\n42:31.960 --> 42:36.680\n But in our society, judges even sentence people\n\n42:36.680 --> 42:39.040\n to go to AA.\n\n42:39.040 --> 42:40.680\n Are you kidding me?\n\n42:40.680 --> 42:44.920\n But that's the kind of thing that has been allowed to happen\n\n42:44.920 --> 42:48.440\n in this society because we think of drugs\n\n42:48.440 --> 42:51.840\n as this moral failing or drug addiction\n\n42:51.840 --> 42:53.240\n as this moral failing.\n\n42:54.120 --> 42:56.600\n And any idiot can provide treatment\n\n42:56.600 --> 43:00.760\n and no disrespect to AA because I think what they do\n\n43:00.760 --> 43:02.880\n is a lot more than what some people do\n\n43:02.880 --> 43:05.920\n because at least they have this social,\n\n43:05.920 --> 43:09.720\n these social interactions, you have a social group.\n\n43:09.720 --> 43:12.520\n That's better than what a lot of these other idiots\n\n43:12.520 --> 43:13.640\n out here do.\n\n43:13.640 --> 43:18.440\n Well, and that social support group unrelated to the drug,\n\n43:18.440 --> 43:20.960\n it helps cure some of the environment issues\n\n43:20.960 --> 43:21.800\n you might be in.\n\n43:21.800 --> 43:23.000\n That's the whole point.\n\n43:23.000 --> 43:25.120\n So we kind of coupled the drug to the environment,\n\n43:25.120 --> 43:28.400\n but the reality is, as you argue,\n\n43:28.400 --> 43:31.000\n most of the problems come from the environment.\n\n43:31.000 --> 43:32.960\n Certainly with people who are experiencing\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:34.800\n drug related problem with most of the people,\n\n43:34.800 --> 43:36.840\n not all, but most.\n\n43:36.840 --> 43:40.800\n There are differences like that psychedelics\n\n43:40.800 --> 43:43.880\n and like psilocybin has versus alcohol.\n\n43:43.880 --> 43:48.880\n I personally think I've enjoyed both experiences\n\n43:49.200 --> 43:50.320\n in different ways.\n\n43:51.200 --> 43:54.920\n Is it possible or are we getting into the realm of poetry\n\n43:54.920 --> 43:59.480\n to describe the benefits, like how it alters the mind,\n\n43:59.480 --> 44:02.040\n how the different drugs alter the mind\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.000\n and the places it can take you\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:06.800\n that produce a positive experience?\n\n44:06.800 --> 44:09.480\n Yeah, no, it's very real.\n\n44:09.480 --> 44:14.480\n Like some drugs take people in places that other drugs can\n\n44:14.840 --> 44:17.000\n and that's very real.\n\n44:17.000 --> 44:21.560\n I have friends, some of them you know,\n\n44:21.560 --> 44:26.560\n they, for example, say that they've never had an experience\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:29.760\n like the one they had with ayahuasca\n\n44:29.760 --> 44:32.200\n and they've done a number of sort of things,\n\n44:32.200 --> 44:37.200\n but they did the ayahuasca in a setting with a shaman\n\n44:38.120 --> 44:43.120\n and this group and they felt like they actually began\n\n44:45.400 --> 44:47.560\n to heal or solve some problems\n\n44:47.560 --> 44:50.960\n that they were trying to solve for some years.\n\n44:50.960 --> 44:54.000\n And that's great, that's great for them.\n\n44:54.000 --> 44:56.600\n And nothing else does it for them like that.\n\n44:56.600 --> 44:59.120\n And that's absolutely fantastic.\n\n44:59.120 --> 45:04.120\n All I argue is that if that kind of thing happens for you\n\n45:06.880 --> 45:09.520\n with ayahuasca, with psilocybin,\n\n45:09.520 --> 45:12.320\n with some other psychedelic,\n\n45:12.320 --> 45:16.880\n why isn't it possible that heroin does that for someone\n\n45:16.880 --> 45:19.600\n or cocaine does that for someone else\n\n45:19.600 --> 45:23.240\n or MDMA does it for someone, that's it.\n\n45:23.240 --> 45:27.280\n That's interesting to imagine like a shaman for heroin.\n\n45:27.280 --> 45:29.120\n Like why not?\n\n45:29.120 --> 45:31.480\n Or cocaine, you said creating an environment for yourself,\n\n45:31.480 --> 45:33.960\n for use of these different substances\n\n45:33.960 --> 45:38.960\n and that environment has a very strong impact\n\n45:39.600 --> 45:41.720\n on the actual experience that you have.\n\n45:41.720 --> 45:46.720\n But I mean, so cocaine is an upper and then.\n\n45:47.320 --> 45:50.840\n Yeah, the way we define drugs like uppers and downers,\n\n45:50.840 --> 45:55.840\n that's a really kind of inappropriate way\n\n45:55.840 --> 45:57.320\n but it's a quick way.\n\n45:57.320 --> 46:01.000\n So we certainly say cocaine is an upper or stimulant.\n\n46:01.000 --> 46:05.120\n But it depends on the activity of the person\n\n46:05.120 --> 46:06.200\n before they take the drug.\n\n46:06.200 --> 46:08.280\n Say like if you're like really active\n\n46:08.280 --> 46:10.560\n before taking a drug like cocaine,\n\n46:10.560 --> 46:12.640\n it might actually calm you.\n\n46:12.640 --> 46:15.440\n So it all depends on the activity of the person\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:16.720\n before they take the drug.\n\n46:16.720 --> 46:19.800\n I remember, I don't know if you know Matthew Johnson is.\n\n46:19.800 --> 46:21.320\n Of course.\n\n46:21.320 --> 46:22.840\n He did all these studies on,\n\n46:22.840 --> 46:25.040\n or I remember just reading a paper,\n\n46:25.040 --> 46:27.040\n I didn't get a chance to talk with him much about it,\n\n46:27.040 --> 46:30.560\n but it was about condom use and cocaine.\n\n46:30.560 --> 46:33.080\n And then like the doses\n\n46:33.080 --> 46:35.480\n and whether people are more or less likely.\n\n46:35.480 --> 46:40.320\n Like the unsafe thing there is the using or not using,\n\n46:40.320 --> 46:45.320\n or not using, I guess, condoms during sexual intercourse.\n\n46:45.480 --> 46:48.040\n I don't know, I just, I love that these drugs\n\n46:48.040 --> 46:52.000\n that have connotation probably because of Hollywood,\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.520\n negative connotations are actually being studied by science.\n\n46:54.520 --> 46:56.360\n And then the actual impact they have,\n\n46:56.360 --> 46:57.960\n and what are the negative effects.\n\n46:57.960 --> 47:00.000\n Again, in those studies often,\n\n47:01.240 --> 47:05.080\n the positive effects are difficult to quantify, I think.\n\n47:05.080 --> 47:08.080\n Maybe I guess you can from self report and so on.\n\n47:08.080 --> 47:11.120\n Positive effects are not difficult to quantify.\n\n47:11.120 --> 47:15.200\n You ask people about their euphoria,\n\n47:15.200 --> 47:18.040\n you can see how well people are getting along.\n\n47:18.040 --> 47:22.560\n Like in our studies that we have people sometimes in groups\n\n47:22.560 --> 47:25.520\n and you see how well they get along\n\n47:25.520 --> 47:29.720\n on the various drug conditions or placebo conditions.\n\n47:29.720 --> 47:32.240\n It's really, it's not that difficult.\n\n47:32.240 --> 47:34.360\n And then you can see these amazing studies\n\n47:34.360 --> 47:37.960\n with like Rick Doblin, like the looking at MDMA\n\n47:37.960 --> 47:40.560\n and combined with therapy,\n\n47:41.920 --> 47:44.760\n like how you can overcome certain PTSD things\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:46.920\n or depression and so on.\n\n47:46.920 --> 47:48.280\n Yeah, it's really interesting.\n\n47:48.280 --> 47:50.840\n It's really interesting.\n\n47:50.840 --> 47:53.400\n I had to ask you, cause you mentioned The Wire.\n\n47:53.400 --> 47:56.280\n Do you think The Wire, you think movies like Trainspotting,\n\n47:56.280 --> 47:58.080\n do you think they're ultimately destroying?\n\n47:58.080 --> 47:58.920\n Cause okay.\n\n47:59.960 --> 48:02.160\n Yes, they celebrate murder, right?\n\n48:02.160 --> 48:04.240\n The Godfather a little bit.\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:05.080\n Yeah.\n\n48:05.080 --> 48:07.240\n But another one, I mean,\n\n48:07.240 --> 48:10.080\n it's like these racist ass motherfuckers\n\n48:10.080 --> 48:12.600\n and they also are killing people,\n\n48:12.600 --> 48:14.720\n but yet they say, we don't do drugs.\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:16.120\n What kind of shit is that?\n\n48:16.120 --> 48:21.120\n I mean, people who are doing drugs, psilocybin or whatever.\n\n48:21.480 --> 48:24.480\n The thing is we're trying to be better people\n\n48:24.480 --> 48:27.080\n and trying to make our society better\n\n48:27.080 --> 48:28.160\n and you're killing people\n\n48:28.160 --> 48:32.280\n and you are denigrating people for using drugs.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:33.440\n Are you fucking kidding me?\n\n48:33.440 --> 48:35.920\n And we let them get away with that as a society.\n\n48:35.920 --> 48:37.160\n Do you see those movies?\n\n48:37.160 --> 48:39.680\n I apologize if I'm not sufficiently informed.\n\n48:39.680 --> 48:41.720\n You see them as denigrating drugs?\n\n48:41.720 --> 48:42.560\n Of course.\n\n48:42.560 --> 48:44.720\n I mean, The Godfather.\n\n48:44.720 --> 48:45.560\n Yes, that's right.\n\n48:45.560 --> 48:46.400\n That's a good example.\n\n48:46.400 --> 48:49.520\n The Godfather, The Sopranos is all about that.\n\n48:49.520 --> 48:53.600\n I mean, Christopher is using heroin in The Sopranos\n\n48:53.600 --> 48:58.440\n and they have an intervention in one season\n\n48:58.440 --> 49:02.880\n and they are denigrating him.\n\n49:02.880 --> 49:03.720\n Are you kidding me?\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:05.640\n You just cut somebody's head off.\n\n49:05.640 --> 49:07.840\n Yeah, but they're, to be fair,\n\n49:07.840 --> 49:10.520\n they were denigrating, I think, all drugs.\n\n49:10.520 --> 49:13.080\n And then they're drinking alcohol in the butterbeam.\n\n49:13.080 --> 49:13.920\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n49:13.920 --> 49:18.120\n Come on, I mean, first of all, they're killing people.\n\n49:18.120 --> 49:21.320\n They don't have any space, none,\n\n49:21.320 --> 49:23.760\n to denigrate somebody who's just trying\n\n49:23.760 --> 49:26.520\n to alter their consciousness.\n\n49:26.520 --> 49:27.520\n Are you kidding me?\n\n49:27.520 --> 49:29.600\n And not bothering anyone else.\n\n49:29.600 --> 49:31.400\n But there's a lot of other mob movies\n\n49:31.400 --> 49:35.960\n that Scarface celebrates the murder and the drugs equally.\n\n49:35.960 --> 49:39.280\n So, I mean, it doesn't,\n\n49:39.280 --> 49:44.280\n it celebrates all of the, not just drugs or so on,\n\n49:44.360 --> 49:45.200\n it's extreme.\n\n49:45.200 --> 49:46.760\n All of those movies, you know,\n\n49:46.760 --> 49:48.000\n I loved all those movies.\n\n49:48.000 --> 49:50.080\n I'm from Miami, I loved Scarface.\n\n49:50.080 --> 49:52.440\n I even liked The Sopranos that I started looking\n\n49:52.440 --> 49:55.200\n at that shit with a critical eye and see what it's doing.\n\n49:56.520 --> 50:01.520\n But Scarface is dependent upon the American viewer\n\n50:02.560 --> 50:06.240\n having a certain view of people who deal in drugs.\n\n50:06.240 --> 50:10.560\n And that view is that these people are animals, basically.\n\n50:10.560 --> 50:14.000\n And in the end, the animal kills himself\n\n50:14.000 --> 50:16.720\n with too much cocaine and he was high.\n\n50:16.720 --> 50:17.880\n That's what they show.\n\n50:17.880 --> 50:20.680\n And so it's like, what the fuck?\n\n50:20.680 --> 50:22.120\n So it's leveraging, it's playing\n\n50:22.120 --> 50:26.040\n into not the better angels of our nature.\n\n50:31.000 --> 50:31.840\n The question.\n\n50:31.840 --> 50:34.080\n Don't take away these great movies from me.\n\n50:34.080 --> 50:36.360\n But it's true, you have to think about them critically\n\n50:36.360 --> 50:37.200\n in the context.\n\n50:37.200 --> 50:38.800\n Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n50:38.800 --> 50:39.640\n I like these movies.\n\n50:39.640 --> 50:41.080\n It's not a matter of taking away.\n\n50:41.080 --> 50:45.920\n It's a matter of making the writers be more honest\n\n50:45.920 --> 50:46.960\n to the reality.\n\n50:46.960 --> 50:47.800\n That's it.\n\n50:47.800 --> 50:48.640\n That's true.\n\n50:48.640 --> 50:49.480\n That's really true.\n\n50:49.480 --> 50:52.080\n And the writers, the people, the culture, all of it.\n\n50:52.080 --> 50:54.240\n I mean, they write these things.\n\n50:54.240 --> 50:57.000\n I just think about some hip hop artists.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.640\n They say like, this is real.\n\n50:58.640 --> 51:01.240\n This is my experience and so forth.\n\n51:01.240 --> 51:02.960\n And that's how these movie writers,\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:06.160\n they write this bullshit and then say, well, this is real.\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:10.440\n Anyway, I get so upset talking about it\n\n51:10.440 --> 51:12.920\n because I know the harm it's doing.\n\n51:12.920 --> 51:16.200\n And I know those kinds of movies are the reason\n\n51:16.200 --> 51:18.800\n that we have this war on drugs.\n\n51:18.800 --> 51:21.360\n And all of these people are going to jail\n\n51:21.360 --> 51:23.160\n because of those kinds of movies.\n\n51:24.560 --> 51:28.400\n In the epilogue of your book, you quote James Baldwin.\n\n51:28.400 --> 51:31.120\n You cannot know what you will discover on the journey,\n\n51:31.120 --> 51:33.560\n what you will do with what you find\n\n51:33.560 --> 51:36.600\n or what you find will do to you.\n\n51:36.600 --> 51:40.600\n So let me ask, how has drug use or the study of drugs\n\n51:40.600 --> 51:42.920\n changed you as a human being?\n\n51:42.920 --> 51:46.520\n It has helped me think about other people's experience.\n\n51:46.520 --> 51:51.040\n So how we're all connected, like going to Northern Ireland.\n\n51:51.040 --> 51:53.480\n I don't know if you know much about the situation\n\n51:53.480 --> 51:57.000\n with the troubles and what those people went through.\n\n51:57.000 --> 51:59.760\n And so I see people there.\n\n51:59.760 --> 52:02.240\n Northern Ireland, by the way, is all white.\n\n52:02.240 --> 52:04.840\n And you see those people there suffering\n\n52:04.840 --> 52:08.200\n for the same reasons that people in Appalachia\n\n52:08.200 --> 52:09.880\n are suffering for.\n\n52:09.880 --> 52:14.640\n Neglected by politicians who told them lies about drugs\n\n52:14.640 --> 52:16.560\n and not dealing with the real problems,\n\n52:16.560 --> 52:19.000\n like West Virginia, for example.\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:22.440\n Their water's polluted, the factories have gone away,\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:25.920\n people are desperate and they're blaming drugs.\n\n52:25.920 --> 52:27.560\n Are you kidding me?\n\n52:27.560 --> 52:31.360\n So the politicians don't have to bring back the jobs.\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:34.320\n So we don't have to really make sure\n\n52:34.320 --> 52:37.560\n they have clean drinking water, things of that nature.\n\n52:37.560 --> 52:39.360\n And so those people are connected\n\n52:39.360 --> 52:40.720\n to the people in Northern Ireland.\n\n52:40.720 --> 52:43.640\n They're connected to the people in Brownsville.\n\n52:43.640 --> 52:46.840\n They're connected to the people in other places\n\n52:46.840 --> 52:49.120\n in the United States for the same reason.\n\n52:49.120 --> 52:54.640\n They're connected to the people in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:58.320\n Same thing, people are catching hell for the same reason\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:01.360\n in the Philippines for the same reason.\n\n53:01.360 --> 53:04.920\n And that's why I feel so strongly about this thing\n\n53:04.920 --> 53:08.600\n because I know there are people getting paid\n\n53:08.600 --> 53:13.200\n and their paycheck is predicated on subjugating\n\n53:13.200 --> 53:15.200\n and the suffering of those other people.\n\n53:17.520 --> 53:21.920\n So when we hear about the destructive effects of drugs,\n\n53:21.920 --> 53:28.000\n it's essentially a scapegoat for the failures of leaders\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:30.920\n and politicians to help alleviate the suffering\n\n53:30.920 --> 53:31.760\n of people in those communities.\n\n53:31.760 --> 53:34.560\n Absolutely, it's so easy to say,\n\n53:34.560 --> 53:36.800\n I'm gonna rid your community of drugs.\n\n53:36.800 --> 53:38.640\n I'm gonna put more cops on the street.\n\n53:40.360 --> 53:45.000\n If you want a problem not to be solved,\n\n53:45.000 --> 53:47.280\n just give it to the military or the cops.\n\n53:48.280 --> 53:51.760\n You had a tough childhood growing up in Miami, like you said.\n\n53:51.760 --> 53:56.720\n What memory stands out in particular that was formative\n\n53:56.720 --> 53:59.240\n and helping make you the man you are?\n\n54:00.520 --> 54:08.480\n That's so hard to say, my grandmother was really important.\n\n54:08.480 --> 54:13.200\n So maybe just her trying to make sure that I think critically,\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:14.640\n I guess that's the biggest one.\n\n54:15.520 --> 54:18.200\n So you moved in with your parents split?\n\n54:19.320 --> 54:20.760\n Six, seven, yeah.\n\n54:20.760 --> 54:23.520\n What have you learned about life from her?\n\n54:23.520 --> 54:28.320\n Be self sufficient, be critical and keep your eyes open\n\n54:28.320 --> 54:30.760\n and watch out for the okie doke.\n\n54:30.760 --> 54:33.440\n And that's what this whole drug thing is about.\n\n54:33.440 --> 54:38.280\n It's the okie doke, people, it really boils down\n\n54:38.280 --> 54:40.120\n to just simple thing.\n\n54:40.120 --> 54:43.800\n We're all similar in that we're all just trying\n\n54:43.800 --> 54:46.240\n to live our life, trying to take care of our kids.\n\n54:46.240 --> 54:48.680\n We want the best for our kids, all of us.\n\n54:48.680 --> 54:54.480\n But yet somehow we've been made to believe\n\n54:54.480 --> 54:56.720\n that we're different in that way.\n\n54:56.720 --> 54:58.680\n But fundamentally, we're all the same.\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:04.160\n So when people are seeking to feel pleasure, to feel better,\n\n55:05.120 --> 55:06.800\n why don't we celebrate that?\n\n55:06.800 --> 55:10.480\n Instead, we denigrate people for that.\n\n55:10.480 --> 55:15.240\n I mean, if I feel better, I'm more likely to treat you well.\n\n55:15.240 --> 55:19.960\n I got to say still, though, you're going against the grain\n\n55:19.960 --> 55:25.480\n and you're at Columbia, it takes a lot of guts\n\n55:25.480 --> 55:29.280\n to sort of speak out about these ideas so boldly.\n\n55:29.280 --> 55:32.360\n I don't know how to ask this question.\n\n55:32.360 --> 55:34.160\n Where do you find the guts?\n\n55:34.160 --> 55:39.320\n What, because it's also perhaps inspirational to others\n\n55:39.320 --> 55:41.720\n in different disciplines that are sort of taking\n\n55:41.720 --> 55:43.920\n on the conventional wisdom of the day.\n\n55:43.920 --> 55:47.040\n And challenging it, what does it take to do that?\n\n55:47.040 --> 55:50.800\n What advice would you give to others like you kind\n\n55:50.800 --> 55:52.680\n of a little bit afraid to do so?\n\n55:52.680 --> 55:56.320\n Once you know, you cannot not know, as they say.\n\n55:56.320 --> 55:58.040\n And so I have to look in the mirror.\n\n55:58.040 --> 56:01.720\n And then looking in the mirror, I have to face myself.\n\n56:01.720 --> 56:03.880\n Have I lived honestly?\n\n56:03.880 --> 56:10.520\n And if I can't face myself, then what am I doing here?\n\n56:10.520 --> 56:14.640\n You know, that's how I see it.\n\n56:14.640 --> 56:19.120\n One of the things that people don't really talk about\n\n56:19.120 --> 56:23.720\n with drugs and people who die from some drug related death.\n\n56:23.720 --> 56:27.200\n And I've been thinking about this a whole lot\n\n56:27.200 --> 56:28.800\n over the past couple of years.\n\n56:28.800 --> 56:33.120\n It's like some of these drugs can take you to a place\n\n56:33.120 --> 56:37.520\n where you feel so optimistic and positive about humans,\n\n56:37.520 --> 56:39.200\n our fellow humans.\n\n56:39.200 --> 56:43.560\n And you want to do your best to contribute.\n\n56:43.560 --> 56:46.120\n And because you know the possibilities\n\n56:46.120 --> 56:49.760\n of what we can be as a society.\n\n56:49.760 --> 56:54.040\n And then you come up with resistance and you, like you say,\n\n56:54.040 --> 56:55.920\n there are a lot, there's a lot of resistance\n\n56:55.920 --> 56:58.440\n and people just have a hard time.\n\n56:58.440 --> 57:03.640\n And so if you know humans can be better\n\n57:03.640 --> 57:07.720\n and they refuse to be better, why be here\n\n57:07.720 --> 57:12.080\n as someone who knows that we can do this better?\n\n57:12.080 --> 57:15.520\n I certainly don't want to do it the way we're doing it.\n\n57:15.520 --> 57:19.680\n So you kind of see drugs as mechanisms\n\n57:19.680 --> 57:21.720\n for potentially elevating the human spirit,\n\n57:21.720 --> 57:24.440\n sort of making people feel better.\n\n57:24.440 --> 57:26.960\n So you want to communicate that message.\n\n57:26.960 --> 57:32.440\n So it's that plus the fact that drugs are used as scapegoat\n\n57:32.440 --> 57:36.520\n to not alleviate the suffering of certain communities.\n\n57:36.520 --> 57:38.320\n So those two things come together.\n\n57:38.320 --> 57:41.440\n One of the sort of main points of the book too\n\n57:41.440 --> 57:45.760\n was to try and get people to understand the possibilities\n\n57:45.760 --> 57:52.480\n that we could have if we embraced certain drug use.\n\n57:52.480 --> 57:56.720\n If we allowed adults to do this sort of thing.\n\n57:56.720 --> 58:01.400\n Relationships can be better.\n\n58:01.400 --> 58:04.200\n A wide range of beneficial effects.\n\n58:04.200 --> 58:09.880\n People would be, or can learn to be more magnanimous.\n\n58:09.880 --> 58:15.040\n All of these pro social things that we say we value.\n\n58:15.040 --> 58:16.520\n In your previous book, High Price,\n\n58:16.520 --> 58:21.280\n you talk about rap and DJing, chapter five.\n\n58:21.280 --> 58:24.960\n There's a nice picture of you DJing from 1983.\n\n58:24.960 --> 58:28.000\n So let me ask who in your view,\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.400\n this is the toughest question of this interview,\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:32.440\n is the greatest hip hop artist of all time?\n\n58:32.440 --> 58:34.280\n Maybe give some candidates.\n\n58:34.280 --> 58:35.080\n Oh, wow.\n\n58:35.080 --> 58:37.840\n Who is the greatest hip hop artist?\n\n58:37.840 --> 58:40.240\n I don't know if I'm qualified to make that bag\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:47.600\n because I have to go back to like Gil Scott Heron.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:52.960\n Like people think of him as one of the fathers of hip hop.\n\n58:52.960 --> 58:56.200\n That's my all time favorite.\n\n58:56.200 --> 58:58.720\n People like Chuck D from Public Enemy.\n\n58:58.720 --> 59:00.520\n Some of the things that they were doing,\n\n59:00.520 --> 59:04.160\n I was really digging, but even though I was digging\n\n59:04.160 --> 59:08.880\n like Public Enemy, but even they got it wrong on drugs.\n\n59:08.880 --> 59:12.200\n Even Gil Scott Heron got it wrong on drugs.\n\n59:12.200 --> 59:16.280\n But they were doing so much other good stuff.\n\n59:16.280 --> 59:20.720\n It helped me to develop as a person.\n\n59:20.720 --> 59:29.200\n And so I think like my son is a hip hop artist now.\n\n59:29.200 --> 59:31.840\n I think those folks who are in the game now,\n\n59:31.840 --> 59:35.360\n they are a lot more qualified to talk about who's\n\n59:35.360 --> 59:37.680\n the greatest hip hop artist.\n\n59:37.680 --> 59:38.800\n I'm not qualified.\n\n59:38.800 --> 59:41.240\n The evolution, I mean, have you tracked the evolution\n\n59:41.240 --> 59:45.800\n from sort of the 90s with Wu Tang and Tupac and Biggie\n\n59:45.800 --> 59:48.160\n and then to what we have today?\n\n59:48.160 --> 59:50.800\n So there's just been a crazy amount of progress.\n\n59:50.800 --> 59:52.680\n It's like almost difficult to track.\n\n59:52.680 --> 59:55.480\n Yeah, I mean, I really love what they're doing.\n\n59:55.480 --> 59:59.280\n I like what they accept the part where they get over 40\n\n59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.520\n and they become fucking cops on TV.\n\n1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:05.320\n I mean, other than that, I dig what's that about.\n\n1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:08.000\n Yeah, I don't understand that, but that's what they do.\n\n1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:13.720\n Again, this sort of glorification of cops,\n\n1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:16.280\n that's dangerous for a society.\n\n1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:19.280\n And those cats who do that kind of thing,\n\n1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:21.000\n I have a problem with that.\n\n1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.520\n Is it all sort of to push back a little bit?\n\n1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:25.120\n Because I come from the Soviet Union\n\n1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:26.880\n where there's a huge amount of corruption.\n\n1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:30.640\n And when I see what's going on with cops in this country,\n\n1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.880\n there's a lot of proper criticism you can apply,\n\n1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:36.120\n but like relative to other places,\n\n1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.560\n this is, well, on so many ways, this country is incredible.\n\n1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:44.040\n Is your criticism towards cops\n\n1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:46.320\n or towards what cops are asked to do?\n\n1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:49.560\n Yeah, towards what cops are asked to do.\n\n1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:54.560\n Cops provide the shield for politicians and those in power.\n\n1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:57.120\n Absolutely, because I was in the military,\n\n1:00:57.120 --> 1:00:58.760\n I spent four years in the military\n\n1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:00.880\n and I did what I was told to do.\n\n1:01:00.880 --> 1:01:06.000\n And I was ignorant and thought I was doing the right thing.\n\n1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.240\n And I did what I was told to do.\n\n1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.640\n And so just like these guys are doing what they're told to do.\n\n1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:15.160\n But no, my real beef is with the power structure,\n\n1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:17.640\n the folks who are telling them what to do.\n\n1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:22.640\n And also the folks who go play cops on television.\n\n1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:27.640\n That imagery, that sort of glorifying cops,\n\n1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.560\n that's a problem in a democracy.\n\n1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:32.680\n Yeah, all sides of the glorification\n\n1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:35.160\n of the drug war is a problem.\n\n1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:40.240\n If I can just linger on a little longer\n\n1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:42.360\n in terms of the effects of drugs,\n\n1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:46.560\n on the positive like mind expanding components of it,\n\n1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:51.560\n what have mind altering drugs teach you\n\n1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:55.240\n about the human mind?\n\n1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:59.920\n Sort of from a neuroscience, not even like a biochemical,\n\n1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:02.960\n but just like the human mind is amazing, right?\n\n1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.400\n The places it can go.\n\n1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.040\n Like, are there some insights you've learned\n\n1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:11.200\n from studying drugs about the mind?\n\n1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:15.000\n Yeah, can I start from a neurochemical perspective first\n\n1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.720\n and then we'll go larger?\n\n1:02:16.720 --> 1:02:19.280\n Just from a neurochemical perspective.\n\n1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:22.440\n I mean, everything I know about the brain,\n\n1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:25.800\n I learned through drugs because of my interest in drugs.\n\n1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:28.280\n So I learned a lot about dopamine neurons\n\n1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:30.840\n in certain regions of the brain, about neuro epinephrine\n\n1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:35.840\n neurons and a wide range of other sort of neural transmission\n\n1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:37.120\n happened because of drugs.\n\n1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:41.800\n And so that's a really valuable tool, lessons for me.\n\n1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:45.160\n But then when we think that we move out a bit\n\n1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:46.360\n and we think more globally,\n\n1:02:46.360 --> 1:02:50.240\n what have I learned in terms of the mind from drugs?\n\n1:02:52.720 --> 1:02:57.720\n I have really learned how to be more forgiving of people\n\n1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:04.800\n and myself and tolerant, more tolerant of people\n\n1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:10.680\n and certainly learned a lot more about empathy\n\n1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:13.840\n as a result of drug use.\n\n1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:21.000\n And like I said earlier, I'm learning what we can be\n\n1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.960\n as a species and it's quite incredible,\n\n1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:27.520\n but because of drugs.\n\n1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:29.920\n Yeah, there's a certain property of drugs in different ways.\n\n1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:31.280\n They take you out of your body,\n\n1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:34.600\n like they help you evaluate yourself\n\n1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:36.640\n from like a third person perspective.\n\n1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:38.560\n It's almost like you have a consciousness in here\n\n1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:41.040\n and you get to step outside of it a little bit.\n\n1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:42.960\n I mean, that's kind of what meditation does too.\n\n1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:44.560\n All of these processes,\n\n1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:47.320\n that's what a hell of a good workout does too.\n\n1:03:47.320 --> 1:03:50.640\n It makes you evaluate yourself and then somehow\n\n1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.840\n that allows you to be forgiving to yourself\n\n1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:57.680\n and forgiving to others, sort of empathize.\n\n1:03:57.680 --> 1:03:59.720\n It trains that part of your brain.\n\n1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:01.240\n So stepping outside of yourself,\n\n1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.760\n not taking yourself too seriously, that process.\n\n1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:06.280\n And different drugs do that in different ways.\n\n1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:07.920\n Obviously, I don't know from personal experience\n\n1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:12.920\n on some of them, but I'm now curious,\n\n1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:18.760\n it's unfortunate that the Hollywood and different stories\n\n1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:23.760\n we have demonize certain drugs and sort of basically,\n\n1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:25.440\n I don't know, make it difficult for people like me\n\n1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:28.440\n to explore those ideas, but then I'm really thankful\n\n1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:30.600\n for people like you who are pushing the science forward\n\n1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.120\n and are unafraid to talk about this kind of stuff.\n\n1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:36.840\n Cause I'm really fascinated with consciousness\n\n1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.160\n on the engineering side.\n\n1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:42.080\n I really want to build robots that have elements\n\n1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:45.040\n of intelligence, emotion, even consciousness.\n\n1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:47.640\n And for that, we need to understand it in ourselves\n\n1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:51.080\n and drugs is all the different kinds of drugs.\n\n1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:53.920\n If you safely seems like an incredible tool\n\n1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:55.600\n to understand ourselves.\n\n1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:58.080\n And if we're limiting ourselves from certain drugs\n\n1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:01.600\n because of certain political games that are being played,\n\n1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:03.200\n it's sad.\n\n1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:06.880\n And people know this, a lot of middle to upper class\n\n1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:10.520\n people know this, the illicit drug trade business\n\n1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:12.760\n is a multi million dollar industry,\n\n1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:17.080\n multi billion dollar industry that could not be supported\n\n1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.080\n by people who are poor.\n\n1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.800\n And that has to be supported by a lot of customers.\n\n1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:27.640\n And a lot of people around the world know this,\n\n1:05:27.640 --> 1:05:30.080\n they're in the closet and in the book,\n\n1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:32.680\n I call for them to get out of the closet.\n\n1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:35.280\n So we can start being more honest\n\n1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:38.440\n and we can take the pressure off of those people\n\n1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:40.720\n who are not as privileged.\n\n1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.720\n Like I said, you're brave, you're bold.\n\n1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.560\n I gotta ask you for some advice.\n\n1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:48.080\n What advice would you give to a young person today?\n\n1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:52.040\n High school, maybe undergrad, college,\n\n1:05:52.040 --> 1:05:54.280\n thinking about their career,\n\n1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:57.560\n thinking about how to live a life they can be proud of.\n\n1:05:57.560 --> 1:06:00.200\n Yeah, whatever career they choose,\n\n1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:03.600\n just make sure that they dedicate themselves to it\n\n1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:06.400\n and be the best at what they do first.\n\n1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:08.720\n That's what you have to do first.\n\n1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:13.240\n Like people see me advocating for this position.\n\n1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:18.240\n 30 years of science is in these opinions, this view.\n\n1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:21.280\n And trust me, I would be dismissed\n\n1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:24.040\n if I didn't know my shit, if I was not.\n\n1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:26.200\n Yeah, you did the work, you proved yourself,\n\n1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:30.480\n you're legit by the people in the eyes of the people\n\n1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:31.320\n who know.\n\n1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:33.360\n Absolutely, so that's the main thing\n\n1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:34.920\n that I would encourage people to do,\n\n1:06:34.920 --> 1:06:36.480\n really know your craft.\n\n1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:38.680\n If you know your craft,\n\n1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:42.240\n and then maybe you will be a service\n\n1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:45.880\n to your fellow citizens.\n\n1:06:45.880 --> 1:06:48.240\n There are so many people out here faking the funk\n\n1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:50.360\n and they don't know their craft\n\n1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:52.920\n and they're not a service to the people\n\n1:06:52.920 --> 1:06:54.560\n that they claim to serve.\n\n1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:55.800\n And that's a problem.\n\n1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:59.280\n And when you have a fair number of people\n\n1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:01.960\n like that in positions of power,\n\n1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:03.880\n your society is going to crumble.\n\n1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:06.840\n What about the scientific path?\n\n1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:08.680\n You recommend people get a PhD?\n\n1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:13.040\n Not necessarily, like my own children,\n\n1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:14.400\n I don't recommend that.\n\n1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:19.200\n So science can, certainly my science\n\n1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.360\n can be a very petty sort of space to be in.\n\n1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:26.720\n But it was the only sort of path that I had.\n\n1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:29.040\n And so I had to do it.\n\n1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:34.040\n But no, I would really encourage people\n\n1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:38.160\n to just do something that they enjoy\n\n1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.520\n and something that makes them happy.\n\n1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:45.520\n Because the greater number of happy people in our society,\n\n1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:47.920\n the better off we all are.\n\n1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:51.000\n All right, since you mentioned happiness,\n\n1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.360\n gotta ask you about the pursuit of happiness\n\n1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.160\n and the ridiculous question about meaning.\n\n1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:59.240\n Do you think this life has meaning?\n\n1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:01.200\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:02.880\n I'm sorry.\n\n1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:04.560\n I certainly hope it has meaning.\n\n1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.240\n I mean, I'm certainly trying to live my life\n\n1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:08.400\n like it has meaning.\n\n1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:12.200\n You know, I really love my life now.\n\n1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:14.680\n I just got back from Geneva.\n\n1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:17.800\n I spent the summer abroad in Europe\n\n1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.560\n and trying to be in a more civilized place\n\n1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:25.280\n where you can enjoy yourself as a responsible adult.\n\n1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:27.560\n And then it allowed me to decompress\n\n1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:28.800\n and then come back here.\n\n1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:31.200\n The thing about coming back here\n\n1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:33.160\n is that you have to be ready to fight.\n\n1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:35.520\n And I don't wanna fight anymore.\n\n1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:39.680\n I just wanna be able to help a society and people.\n\n1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.920\n And so I'll have to keep a place in Europe\n\n1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:46.320\n to go and decompress and then come back\n\n1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:48.120\n to be able to tolerate the situation.\n\n1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:51.400\n So life for me has a lot of meaning.\n\n1:08:51.400 --> 1:08:53.320\n I'm enjoying life.\n\n1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:57.000\n And this is like the greatest,\n\n1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.120\n the best part of my life ever right now at this moment.\n\n1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:01.920\n So it's the joy,\n\n1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.920\n but you also enjoy the fight a little bit or?\n\n1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:06.040\n No, I don't really, I'm tired of that.\n\n1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:08.480\n You know, it's like, why?\n\n1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.480\n You're trying to,\n\n1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:16.480\n I'm trying to help people to see how they can be happy\n\n1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:19.320\n and then people are fighting me on that.\n\n1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:20.200\n I don't wanna be happy.\n\n1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:21.120\n I wanna be ignorant.\n\n1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:22.280\n Leave me alone.\n\n1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:24.120\n That's what people are saying.\n\n1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:25.840\n Well, so what is the source of joy for you\n\n1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:27.440\n when you decompress?\n\n1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:30.440\n MDMA is a source, you know,\n\n1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:34.880\n and a place where you don't have to worry about laws,\n\n1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:35.880\n that's like Europe.\n\n1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.560\n You can feel really free.\n\n1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:41.960\n Yeah, heroin can even be a nice space\n\n1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:44.320\n if I'm in my own head,\n\n1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:46.640\n but with others, MDMA is great.\n\n1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.960\n So, but good friends, good food.\n\n1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:53.680\n The usual.\n\n1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:55.120\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:56.160\n Family, love.\n\n1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:57.800\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.560\n Carl, you're an incredible human being.\n\n1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:00.680\n You really make me think.\n\n1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:02.120\n Everyone who listens to this,\n\n1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:07.320\n I mean, I'm really glad you exist.\n\n1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:08.800\n I know you say you don't like the fight,\n\n1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:10.400\n but I'm really glad you're fighting the fight\n\n1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:11.920\n because it's gonna help a lot of people.\n\n1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:15.160\n It's gonna help, at the very least,\n\n1:10:15.160 --> 1:10:16.880\n help a lot of people think\n\n1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:19.440\n and challenge the conventions of the day\n\n1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:22.040\n and maybe challenge them to find joy.\n\n1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:24.720\n I really appreciate you spending your valuable time with me.\n\n1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:26.120\n This was an awesome conversation.\n\n1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:27.200\n Thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:29.480\n Thank you for having me, man.\n\n1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:32.840\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Carl Hart.\n\n1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:34.080\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:10:34.080 --> 1:10:36.840\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:10:36.840 --> 1:10:40.280\n And now let me leave you with some words from Frank Zappa.\n\n1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.800\n A drug is not bad.\n\n1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.160\n A drug is a chemical compound.\n\n1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.400\n The problem comes in when people who take drugs\n\n1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:50.160\n treat them like a license to behave like an asshole.\n\n1:10:50.160 --> 1:11:11.160\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
