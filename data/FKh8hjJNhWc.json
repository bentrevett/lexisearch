mathematician who is one of the most well read and knowledgeable people\n\n00:11.160 --> 00:15.800\n on the technical side of cryptocurrency that I've ever spoken to.\n\n00:15.800 --> 00:23.480\n Quick mention of our sponsors, Galila Games, Allform, Indeed, ExpressVPN, and Asleep.\n\n00:23.480 --> 00:26.960\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:26.960 --> 00:31.640\n As a side note, let me say that Charles is not just a mathematician or cryptocurrency\n\n00:31.640 --> 00:40.560\n innovator, but also a Colorado based farmer of bison and mushrooms, a gamer, a fisherman,\n\n00:40.560 --> 00:41.960\n and a world traveler.\n\n00:41.960 --> 00:46.680\n When I asked him if he has a nice professional picture of himself, he sent me a picture of\n\n00:46.680 --> 00:52.840\n him in Mongolia with a hawk on his shoulder, meeting the Mongolian president.\n\n00:52.840 --> 00:57.780\n That to me pretty much says it all, speaking to the humor and the intelligence of a man\n\n00:57.780 --> 01:04.120\n who is bold, innovative, and does not shy away from a bit of fun and a bit of controversy,\n\n01:04.120 --> 01:07.880\n which makes him a fascinating human being to explore ideas with.\n\n01:07.880 --> 01:13.600\n I do want to say in terms of ideas that, at least to me, cryptocurrency is much bigger\n\n01:13.600 --> 01:19.320\n than just a way for a few Americans to make a quick buck through meme driven speculation.\n\n01:19.320 --> 01:24.340\n It is technology that enables freedom from oppression, from suffering in the world, because\n\n01:24.340 --> 01:26.360\n money is power.\n\n01:26.360 --> 01:30.300\n Mongolia, for example, was a reminder of that for me.\n\n01:30.300 --> 01:35.880\n Next day, after talking with Charles, I spoke with Wyoming Park, who is a North Korean defector,\n\n01:35.880 --> 01:42.360\n and who spent time in Mongolia, as many defectors do, in her and their escape from North Korea.\n\n01:42.360 --> 01:47.840\n Her story, the story of North Korea, the story of atrocities throughout the 20th century\n\n01:47.840 --> 01:54.600\n committed by Hitler, Stalin, and others, is a reminder that the world is full of darkness,\n\n01:54.600 --> 02:00.640\n but it is also full of beauty and love, and it is a world worth fighting for, in every\n\n02:00.640 --> 02:03.040\n way we know how.\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:22.760\n This is the Lux Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Charles Hoskinson.\n\n02:22.760 --> 02:37.640\n If you\n\n02:37.640 --> 02:39.560\n self evolve, almost like gnomic.\n\n02:39.560 --> 02:41.200\n And then you have Wolfram running around saying,\n\n02:41.200 --> 02:43.400\n hey, we can come up with these like very simple rules\n\n02:43.400 --> 02:45.160\n and we can reconstruct all of reality\n\n02:45.160 --> 02:47.640\n at some arbitrary point.\n\n02:47.640 --> 02:50.280\n So I have absolutely no idea what's right.\n\n02:50.280 --> 02:52.560\n You know, I look at it kind of like a formal system\n\n02:52.560 --> 02:54.920\n and I say, well, if you're stuck within the system,\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:56.320\n it's hard to actually understand\n\n02:56.320 --> 02:57.640\n that you're inside the system.\n\n02:57.640 --> 02:59.920\n You know, it's kind of like an object language\n\n02:59.920 --> 03:01.320\n to a metal language.\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:03.760\n You know, there's this thing that is outside of it,\n\n03:03.760 --> 03:06.720\n but because you're constrained and limited by the simulation,\n\n03:06.720 --> 03:09.160\n you can't really understand the nature of the thing\n\n03:09.160 --> 03:10.800\n that's outside of it.\n\n03:10.800 --> 03:12.040\n It's almost like Minecraft.\n\n03:12.040 --> 03:14.880\n You can build these redstone computers within Minecraft\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:16.600\n and simulate and emulate things within it,\n\n03:16.600 --> 03:19.400\n but you really can't go outside of that environment.\n\n03:19.400 --> 03:21.120\n The people outside of it can formally prove\n\n03:21.120 --> 03:22.760\n that it's correct or whatever,\n\n03:22.760 --> 03:24.680\n but the creatures inside of the system\n\n03:24.680 --> 03:27.320\n can't hope to perfectly understand it\n\n03:27.320 --> 03:28.800\n and prove something about it.\n\n03:28.800 --> 03:31.840\n Well, also the question is, it's a computation question.\n\n03:31.840 --> 03:33.240\n You know, does P equal NP?\n\n03:33.240 --> 03:35.280\n Because you'd have to be able to emulate all of these.\n\n03:35.280 --> 03:36.240\n How long will it take?\n\n03:36.240 --> 03:37.080\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n03:37.080 --> 03:39.840\n And so I have no clue what type of language\n\n03:39.840 --> 03:41.160\n it would have to look like,\n\n03:41.160 --> 03:44.720\n but it would probably not be anything we're used to\n\n03:44.720 --> 03:45.560\n at the moment.\n\n03:45.560 --> 03:46.520\n It'd have to be something else.\n\n03:46.520 --> 03:48.680\n And we'd have to have some more fundamental resolution\n\n03:48.680 --> 03:50.800\n of the relationship of these formal systems\n\n03:50.800 --> 03:52.240\n and how they get extended.\n\n03:52.240 --> 03:54.480\n So that's like a 22nd century question\n\n03:54.480 --> 03:55.720\n instead of a 21st century.\n\n03:55.720 --> 03:58.840\n Do you like, do you find the Stephen Wolfram idea compelling?\n\n03:58.840 --> 04:01.480\n It's a very different way of programming,\n\n04:01.480 --> 04:03.160\n which is you set some rules,\n\n04:03.160 --> 04:04.520\n you set some initial conditions,\n\n04:04.520 --> 04:06.120\n and let it run and see what happens.\n\n04:06.120 --> 04:07.600\n Yeah, and it's not a new concept.\n\n04:07.600 --> 04:09.760\n I mean, like the Santa Fe Institute's been doing that\n\n04:09.760 --> 04:12.800\n for a long time and you can use it for economic modeling\n\n04:12.800 --> 04:14.640\n and you can show that in certain cases,\n\n04:14.640 --> 04:16.320\n there's this concept of simple rules\n\n04:16.320 --> 04:18.160\n evolving into a complex system\n\n04:18.160 --> 04:20.240\n is somewhat more predictive\n\n04:20.240 --> 04:23.480\n than trying to build a complex top down model for things.\n\n04:23.480 --> 04:25.880\n And I guess there's some analogies to these things in AI\n\n04:25.880 --> 04:27.520\n where you start with some simple things\n\n04:27.520 --> 04:29.520\n and then somehow it just figures stuff out\n\n04:29.520 --> 04:30.920\n in its environment over time\n\n04:30.920 --> 04:32.760\n and much better than if you actually tried to model it\n\n04:32.760 --> 04:35.720\n with prologue or something like that.\n\n04:35.720 --> 04:38.640\n So that is exciting\n\n04:38.640 --> 04:40.800\n because you get to just do a few things,\n\n04:40.800 --> 04:43.080\n let the thing run and then see what happens.\n\n04:43.080 --> 04:43.960\n And that's a lot of fun.\n\n04:43.960 --> 04:46.740\n In fact, it got so exciting, Wolfram came to us and he said,\n\n04:46.740 --> 04:48.440\n ''Hey, let's do an NFT marketplace.''\n\n04:48.440 --> 04:49.280\n I said, ''What do you wanna do?'',\n\n04:49.280 --> 04:51.360\n and he said, ''I got all these universes to sell.''\n\n04:51.360 --> 04:54.620\n And I said, ''Okay, well that's gonna be fun.\n\n04:54.620 --> 04:56.120\n So we're gonna set up an auction system\n\n04:56.120 --> 04:57.280\n or something like that with him.\n\n04:57.280 --> 05:00.000\n And I think maybe end of this month or next month,\n\n05:00.000 --> 05:02.800\n we'll figure out how to do NFTs on Cardano\n\n05:02.800 --> 05:04.520\n with Wolfram universes.\n\n05:04.520 --> 05:06.880\n So as soon as we can sell one, I'll give you one\n\n05:06.880 --> 05:08.360\n and then we can all just claim\n\n05:08.360 --> 05:10.700\n that we're living in some sort of Wolfram simulation.\n\n05:10.700 --> 05:12.160\n I don't know how much money I have,\n\n05:12.160 --> 05:15.400\n but I'm gonna give everything I have to get rule 30,\n\n05:15.400 --> 05:18.240\n which is one of his universes that he's created.\n\n05:18.240 --> 05:21.560\n One of the first ones where he discovered\n\n05:21.560 --> 05:24.280\n some interesting complexities.\n\n05:24.280 --> 05:26.960\n I think rule 30 is Turing complete or is that 45?\n\n05:26.960 --> 05:28.600\n I can't remember which one.\n\n05:28.600 --> 05:29.720\n You know your stuff.\n\n05:29.720 --> 05:31.240\n Actually, I'm not sure if they proved anything\n\n05:31.240 --> 05:33.340\n about rule 30 in terms of whether it's Turing complete\n\n05:33.340 --> 05:35.920\n or not, but there's fun competitions on it,\n\n05:35.920 --> 05:38.120\n which is trying to predict something about rule 30,\n\n05:38.120 --> 05:39.320\n about the way it evolves.\n\n05:39.320 --> 05:41.440\n And so far, nobody's been able to do it.\n\n05:41.440 --> 05:43.320\n Just like looking at the middle column,\n\n05:43.320 --> 05:45.520\n try to predict as the system evolves,\n\n05:45.520 --> 05:49.480\n say anything like conclusive about the future\n\n05:49.480 --> 05:50.920\n of the system as it evolves.\n\n05:50.920 --> 05:51.880\n It's fascinating.\n\n05:51.880 --> 05:54.560\n It's both beautiful that simple rules\n\n05:54.560 --> 05:56.600\n can create that kind of complexity.\n\n05:56.600 --> 06:01.600\n And it's also sad that we can't like make perfect sense\n\n06:01.600 --> 06:05.880\n of it, like perfectly predict the future.\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:08.240\n Even though it's all simple and deterministic,\n\n06:08.240 --> 06:10.620\n we can't say something conclusive about like\n\n06:10.620 --> 06:12.240\n when the thing will end.\n\n06:12.240 --> 06:14.160\n When will this little cellular automata\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:15.680\n like evolve in a certain way\n\n06:15.680 --> 06:17.320\n and then nuclear weapons will be invented\n\n06:17.320 --> 06:18.260\n and they blow each other up\n\n06:18.260 --> 06:21.440\n and then they'll just be this empty 1D cellular automata.\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:24.180\n Well, doesn't that make it fun though?\n\n06:24.180 --> 06:27.160\n Yeah, it's fun, but when you're trying to create\n\n06:27.160 --> 06:32.160\n and we'll talk about something that operates the economy\n\n06:32.880 --> 06:36.000\n and the way humans transact and cooperate\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:39.360\n and fall in love and work together,\n\n06:39.360 --> 06:41.160\n then you'd like to be a little bit more formal\n\n06:41.160 --> 06:42.760\n and try to say something conclusive.\n\n06:42.760 --> 06:45.900\n If this entire universe is just cellular automata,\n\n06:45.900 --> 06:49.440\n then being conclusive is kind of hopeless,\n\n06:49.440 --> 06:50.400\n generally speaking.\n\n06:50.400 --> 06:54.160\n And the hope is, I guess, that there'll be pockets\n\n06:54.160 --> 06:57.280\n of which within the cellular automata\n\n06:57.280 --> 06:58.720\n where you could be predictive,\n\n06:58.720 --> 07:01.920\n where you can formally show that something is true\n\n07:01.920 --> 07:03.560\n and then you can rely on that.\n\n07:03.560 --> 07:05.360\n You'll be resilient and all those kinds of things,\n\n07:05.360 --> 07:08.720\n even though the rest of the thing is a giant mess\n\n07:08.720 --> 07:09.560\n that's unpredictable.\n\n07:09.560 --> 07:11.120\n Didn't they call that Laplace's demon?\n\n07:11.120 --> 07:14.480\n Yes, I wonder what the demons up to these days.\n\n07:14.480 --> 07:17.400\n Okay, thank you for entertaining me with that.\n\n07:17.400 --> 07:21.160\n But sticking on philosophy, you've also mentioned,\n\n07:21.160 --> 07:24.680\n among others, that Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke\n\n07:24.680 --> 07:26.880\n are two of your favorite philosophers.\n\n07:27.960 --> 07:30.060\n Maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs\n\n07:30.060 --> 07:33.760\n you find insightful and also what do you use the difference,\n\n07:33.760 --> 07:37.280\n because you're both an engineer and a thinker,\n\n07:37.280 --> 07:38.480\n so what do you use the difference\n\n07:38.480 --> 07:40.640\n between philosophy and computer science?\n\n07:40.640 --> 07:43.960\n Yeah, so yeah, there's both a deeply human element\n\n07:43.960 --> 07:45.440\n to both Russell and Saul.\n\n07:45.440 --> 07:47.780\n And then there's this, of course, amazing work\n\n07:47.780 --> 07:50.920\n that they did in the late 19th and 20th century.\n\n07:50.920 --> 07:54.360\n And you can't really talk about Russell or Saul\n\n07:54.360 --> 07:57.840\n without also mentioning Wittgenstein and Tarski.\n\n07:58.800 --> 08:00.800\n Because when you actually look at these guys\n\n08:00.800 --> 08:02.840\n and you put them together, what they were attempting to do\n\n08:02.840 --> 08:05.080\n was increase the level of precision we had\n\n08:05.080 --> 08:06.840\n in analyzing both formal languages\n\n08:06.840 --> 08:08.960\n and also language in general.\n\n08:08.960 --> 08:11.520\n And so Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me.\n\n08:11.520 --> 08:13.620\n So there's amazing people out there\n\n08:13.620 --> 08:15.440\n that somehow can parse that, but.\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:17.280\n He doesn't make sense to himself either.\n\n08:17.280 --> 08:18.260\n I think you're right about that.\n\n08:18.260 --> 08:20.240\n However, Kripke has Kripkenstein.\n\n08:20.240 --> 08:24.520\n He has his whole building on that, right?\n\n08:24.520 --> 08:25.800\n And he built a whole hierarchy.\n\n08:25.800 --> 08:27.600\n And at least there I have modal logic\n\n08:27.600 --> 08:30.420\n and I have the little boxes and I have the diamonds\n\n08:30.420 --> 08:32.700\n and I can do a computation and I can kind of reason\n\n08:32.700 --> 08:35.540\n about things that people are saying.\n\n08:35.540 --> 08:38.280\n But really it was all just about precision\n\n08:38.280 --> 08:40.160\n and the nature of truth, precision,\n\n08:40.160 --> 08:41.980\n the nature of necessity and possibility.\n\n08:41.980 --> 08:43.560\n And the magic of these statements\n\n08:43.560 --> 08:47.440\n is that you can then start getting a better understanding\n\n08:47.440 --> 08:52.080\n of basically how far a formal language can take you.\n\n08:52.080 --> 08:53.920\n And so that's the work of it.\n\n08:53.920 --> 08:55.680\n David Hilbert also did the same thing.\n\n08:55.680 --> 08:57.720\n And Russell, he got his career started\n\n08:57.720 --> 08:59.080\n working with Alfred North Whitehead.\n\n08:59.080 --> 09:01.440\n He was a logician and there was this whole desire\n\n09:01.440 --> 09:04.620\n in late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics\n\n09:04.620 --> 09:07.720\n in a completely new and better way.\n\n09:07.720 --> 09:08.960\n And they started with geometry\n\n09:08.960 --> 09:11.600\n and Hilbert's geometry was like a complete system,\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:13.240\n although recently we've discovered\n\n09:13.240 --> 09:14.540\n there's a few holes in that.\n\n09:14.540 --> 09:16.180\n But for the most part it was complete\n\n09:16.180 --> 09:20.440\n and the axioms are independent and they're consistent.\n\n09:20.440 --> 09:22.040\n And they said, oh, well now we can do this\n\n09:22.040 --> 09:23.080\n for all of mathematics.\n\n09:23.080 --> 09:26.660\n And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of books,\n\n09:26.660 --> 09:27.840\n like two big books,\n\n09:27.840 --> 09:29.880\n Principia Mathematica, a thousand pages\n\n09:29.880 --> 09:32.200\n and the conclusion is one plus one equals two.\n\n09:32.200 --> 09:34.840\n So they linked set theory and arithmetic and logic\n\n09:34.840 --> 09:36.400\n all in these beautiful ways.\n\n09:36.400 --> 09:40.280\n Then little by little, as we entered the 20th century,\n\n09:40.280 --> 09:42.560\n logicians started chipping away at this idea\n\n09:42.560 --> 09:43.640\n that you could actually construct\n\n09:43.640 --> 09:45.960\n a complete system of mathematics.\n\n09:45.960 --> 09:48.200\n First with G\u00f6del and then later with the work of Turing\n\n09:48.200 --> 09:49.440\n and Church and others.\n\n09:49.440 --> 09:52.040\n They said, oh, you're not complete, you're not decidable.\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:55.460\n And so suddenly Russell was left in this really bad position\n\n09:55.460 --> 09:59.200\n where his early life's work was basically forgotten.\n\n09:59.200 --> 10:00.800\n So he had to kind of reinvent himself.\n\n10:00.800 --> 10:02.060\n And so he went into ethics\n\n10:02.060 --> 10:03.600\n and he went into different fields of philosophy.\n\n10:03.600 --> 10:05.600\n He became this titan in analytic philosophy\n\n10:05.600 --> 10:08.000\n and he was also a great pacifist\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:10.440\n and he was just a phenomenal writer.\n\n10:11.320 --> 10:12.880\n If you read Why I'm Not a Christian\n\n10:12.880 --> 10:15.940\n or any of his other attacks on metaphysics,\n\n10:15.940 --> 10:18.480\n he said, look, I can only deal with the world I'm in\n\n10:18.480 --> 10:19.920\n in the senses that I have\n\n10:19.920 --> 10:21.880\n and if I can deduce it, I believe it.\n\n10:21.880 --> 10:23.320\n If it's outside of that,\n\n10:23.320 --> 10:25.920\n I really can't make meaningful statements about it.\n\n10:25.920 --> 10:28.280\n And he said it in a lovely English prose\n\n10:28.280 --> 10:30.260\n that you would expect of a man of his stature.\n\n10:30.260 --> 10:33.260\n Now, Sol Cryptry, it was like the complete opposite.\n\n10:33.260 --> 10:35.560\n This guy's really down to earth dude,\n\n10:35.560 --> 10:36.920\n not aristocratic at all.\n\n10:36.920 --> 10:38.680\n And he was one of those guys\n\n10:38.680 --> 10:40.240\n that just could have done anything\n\n10:40.240 --> 10:42.080\n because he was so, he's so brilliant.\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:43.160\n I guess he's still alive.\n\n10:43.160 --> 10:44.280\n I think he's 80 something.\n\n10:44.280 --> 10:45.600\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n10:45.600 --> 10:47.120\n Yeah, he's getting up there, man.\n\n10:47.120 --> 10:49.040\n But I mean, literally, when he was in high school,\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:52.000\n he wrote these papers in logic and Harvard contacted him,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:55.080\n said, hey, could you teach graduate courses at Harvard?\n\n10:55.080 --> 10:57.160\n And he said, no, I really would like to finish high school\n\n10:57.160 --> 10:59.880\n first before I go and teach grad school at Harvard.\n\n10:59.880 --> 11:01.420\n And so this is just one of those guys\n\n11:01.420 --> 11:03.400\n that you can see through his work\n\n11:03.400 --> 11:05.160\n that he can think deeply about anything.\n\n11:05.160 --> 11:07.180\n He's like the Galois of philosophy\n\n11:07.180 --> 11:10.920\n and he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes\n\n11:10.920 --> 11:12.720\n that Tarski and others couldn't resolve.\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:14.240\n He said, let's really get serious\n\n11:14.240 --> 11:15.280\n about the nature of truth.\n\n11:15.280 --> 11:17.640\n Let's really try to resolve paradoxes.\n\n11:17.640 --> 11:19.900\n Let's really try to build things in such a way\n\n11:19.900 --> 11:21.920\n that the work that we leave behind\n\n11:21.920 --> 11:23.520\n can actually be built upon\n\n11:23.520 --> 11:26.680\n and it's not thrown away every 50 years or 100 years.\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:27.880\n And it was the same for Tarski.\n\n11:27.880 --> 11:28.720\n He comes in and he says,\n\n11:28.720 --> 11:31.280\n we mathematicians love this concept of truth,\n\n11:31.280 --> 11:32.600\n but yet we've never really created\n\n11:32.600 --> 11:33.880\n a nice rigorous definition\n\n11:33.880 --> 11:36.560\n that doesn't have paradoxes embedded inside of it.\n\n11:36.560 --> 11:39.160\n So he had to invent metal languages and object languages,\n\n11:39.160 --> 11:40.840\n all these notions and so forth.\n\n11:40.840 --> 11:43.440\n So I really liked those four, if you think about them.\n\n11:43.440 --> 11:46.000\n And there's a lot of great lessons.\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.320\n And where it's relevant today is,\n\n11:48.320 --> 11:50.400\n you have human beings and you have computers\n\n11:50.400 --> 11:52.000\n and they're trying to understand each other.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.680\n And computers live in the formal world\n\n11:53.680 --> 11:56.000\n and human beings live in the natural language world.\n\n11:56.000 --> 11:58.280\n And those bridges between those two\n\n11:58.280 --> 12:00.920\n are still not completely clear.\n\n12:00.920 --> 12:03.120\n And so a lot of the work that these guys were doing\n\n12:03.120 --> 12:04.320\n in the 20th century, 19th century\n\n12:04.320 --> 12:06.160\n had nothing at all to do with that,\n\n12:06.160 --> 12:09.020\n but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist\n\n12:09.020 --> 12:10.040\n between those two worlds.\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:11.960\n And maybe there are some nice tools\n\n12:11.960 --> 12:13.560\n for that bridge to be built upon.\n\n12:13.560 --> 12:16.040\n And maybe that in some way will allow computers\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:17.040\n to better understand us.\n\n12:17.040 --> 12:19.100\n I mean, they've even created languages,\n\n12:19.100 --> 12:21.720\n natural spoken languages that are completely ambiguity free\n\n12:21.720 --> 12:23.760\n like Lojban and things like that.\n\n12:23.760 --> 12:25.120\n What? Yeah, right.\n\n12:25.120 --> 12:27.520\n Wait, what? L O J B A N, Lojban.\n\n12:27.520 --> 12:29.200\n It's based on a language called Loglan\n\n12:29.200 --> 12:30.920\n and it's a spoken language\n\n12:30.920 --> 12:33.280\n that's equivalent to first order predicate calculus.\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:34.120\n Oh, interesting.\n\n12:34.120 --> 12:36.600\n So no ambiguities, it's logically consistent.\n\n12:36.600 --> 12:38.240\n Yeah, Lojban.\n\n12:38.240 --> 12:40.080\n But can you still have fun in it?\n\n12:40.080 --> 12:40.920\n You can get very.\n\n12:40.920 --> 12:42.240\n Can you write poetry or what?\n\n12:42.240 --> 12:44.560\n There's people who actually write poetry in Lojban.\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:46.480\n I'm gonna switch to that and start tweeting in it.\n\n12:46.480 --> 12:48.080\n Yeah, there you go.\n\n12:48.080 --> 12:49.880\n So there's a lot there\n\n12:49.880 --> 12:52.080\n and they're just fun to study and think about.\n\n12:52.080 --> 12:55.040\n And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole,\n\n12:55.040 --> 12:56.800\n you'll spend way, way too much time\n\n12:56.800 --> 12:57.980\n and there's diminishing returns.\n\n12:57.980 --> 12:59.220\n Now, the second question you asked\n\n12:59.220 --> 13:02.420\n was one on theoretical computer science to,\n\n13:02.420 --> 13:03.260\n I guess, engineering.\n\n13:03.260 --> 13:04.760\n Philosophy, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n13:04.760 --> 13:07.840\n So first step, you said humans and computers.\n\n13:07.840 --> 13:09.440\n So theoretical computer science\n\n13:09.440 --> 13:11.400\n is theory of the computer\n\n13:11.400 --> 13:14.400\n and philosophy is the theory of the human.\n\n13:14.400 --> 13:17.520\n And then we can dissect different stuff about the computer,\n\n13:17.520 --> 13:19.360\n but in terms of these two worlds\n\n13:19.360 --> 13:20.480\n of the theory of the human,\n\n13:20.480 --> 13:22.840\n which is philosophy and the theory of the computer,\n\n13:22.840 --> 13:23.800\n which is computer science,\n\n13:23.800 --> 13:25.520\n what do you think is the difference?\n\n13:25.520 --> 13:28.360\n Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned,\n\n13:29.200 --> 13:33.000\n what is going to be the biggest challenge?\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:35.760\n Like, can we formalize love?\n\n13:35.760 --> 13:38.460\n Can we formalize music, art, poetry,\n\n13:38.460 --> 13:39.300\n all that kind of stuff?\n\n13:39.300 --> 13:42.040\n Or is that human nonsense that we need to get rid of?\n\n13:42.040 --> 13:43.780\n No, I don't think it's human nonsense at all.\n\n13:43.780 --> 13:44.960\n I mean, there's even attempts\n\n13:44.960 --> 13:47.360\n to create algorithmically generated music.\n\n13:47.360 --> 13:49.440\n And the question is,\n\n13:49.440 --> 13:51.720\n is love just strictly a chemical phenomena?\n\n13:51.720 --> 13:54.720\n Is there something like metaphysical about it\n\n13:54.720 --> 13:59.060\n or transcendent of some sort of formal system?\n\n13:59.060 --> 14:00.680\n I mean, computer science is just saying,\n\n14:00.680 --> 14:03.880\n hey, we have this notion of computing.\n\n14:03.880 --> 14:06.080\n We have this brain that we've constructed,\n\n14:06.080 --> 14:08.280\n this formal system that we've built.\n\n14:08.280 --> 14:11.360\n And given that we have it, what can we do with it?\n\n14:11.360 --> 14:12.760\n And so some people worry\n\n14:12.760 --> 14:14.920\n about the roots of the tree of knowledge,\n\n14:14.920 --> 14:17.060\n the great Yggdrasil of computer science.\n\n14:17.060 --> 14:18.160\n They worry about the roots and say,\n\n14:18.160 --> 14:20.060\n how far can we grow them?\n\n14:20.060 --> 14:22.800\n And let's keep adding these new models of computation.\n\n14:22.800 --> 14:25.540\n And other people worry about the trunk of the tree.\n\n14:25.540 --> 14:27.960\n And some people worry about the leaves of the tree.\n\n14:27.960 --> 14:30.540\n And the more advanced the field gets,\n\n14:30.540 --> 14:32.400\n the closer and closer it gets\n\n14:32.400 --> 14:35.320\n to the people who constructed it, us.\n\n14:35.320 --> 14:37.580\n We have better image processing.\n\n14:37.580 --> 14:39.960\n We have better ways of handling speech to texts.\n\n14:39.960 --> 14:41.440\n And we have better ways of computers\n\n14:41.440 --> 14:43.280\n kind of understanding the intent\n\n14:43.280 --> 14:45.120\n of what a human being is saying.\n\n14:45.120 --> 14:46.740\n And then the question is, well,\n\n14:46.740 --> 14:50.080\n how will a computer understand love or poetry or music?\n\n14:50.080 --> 14:52.840\n Well, it'll understand it the same way we understand it.\n\n14:52.840 --> 14:54.840\n You have to get a computer to grow up to a point,\n\n14:54.840 --> 14:56.360\n work and learn the way we learn\n\n14:56.360 --> 14:58.400\n or as close to it as possible.\n\n14:58.400 --> 15:00.360\n Then you just expose it to the things\n\n15:00.360 --> 15:01.480\n that we were exposed with.\n\n15:01.480 --> 15:02.320\n And then at some point,\n\n15:02.320 --> 15:04.720\n the computer will start creating things.\n\n15:04.720 --> 15:07.120\n So the question is, well, how do you quantify creativity?\n\n15:07.120 --> 15:09.360\n And I have no clue about that.\n\n15:09.360 --> 15:10.200\n But it's a...\n\n15:10.200 --> 15:12.240\n You make it into an NFT and see how much it excels for it.\n\n15:12.240 --> 15:14.440\n That's one way.\n\n15:14.440 --> 15:15.280\n Yeah.\n\n15:15.280 --> 15:18.360\n But basically, yeah, there's so much of it is subjective.\n\n15:18.360 --> 15:21.240\n And that's a fascinating whole area of,\n\n15:21.240 --> 15:23.560\n that I'm fascinated with this human robot interaction\n\n15:23.560 --> 15:27.360\n is how do we create compelling experiences\n\n15:27.360 --> 15:28.560\n that are subjectively compelling,\n\n15:28.560 --> 15:31.120\n whether it's art or just two humans talking\n\n15:31.120 --> 15:33.440\n or two humans interacting in some kind of way\n\n15:33.440 --> 15:36.840\n to maximize the richness of the subjective experience.\n\n15:36.840 --> 15:38.960\n And I think that could be an optimization problem\n\n15:38.960 --> 15:39.780\n that could be solved.\n\n15:39.780 --> 15:41.360\n We're solving it all the time.\n\n15:41.360 --> 15:43.640\n Human civilization is constantly trying to...\n\n15:43.640 --> 15:46.880\n We're constantly trying to impress each other.\n\n15:46.880 --> 15:49.320\n When we're younger, trying to get laid,\n\n15:49.320 --> 15:53.080\n whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work\n\n15:53.080 --> 15:54.200\n by all the awesome stuff you do.\n\n15:54.200 --> 15:56.360\n I mean, we're trying to optimize that problem\n\n15:56.360 --> 15:59.440\n that's purely, for the most part, is subjective.\n\n15:59.440 --> 16:01.600\n Right, did you ever watch Blade Runner 2049?\n\n16:01.600 --> 16:02.440\n Yes.\n\n16:02.440 --> 16:03.680\n Yeah, did you remember the whole relationship\n\n16:03.680 --> 16:05.160\n between Joy and Kay?\n\n16:05.160 --> 16:08.720\n And did she really love him, the hologram or not?\n\n16:08.720 --> 16:10.800\n Was it like fake love or real love?\n\n16:10.800 --> 16:13.640\n Fake it till you make it is my view on love.\n\n16:13.640 --> 16:14.680\n No comment from Charles.\n\n16:14.680 --> 16:18.360\n So let's go to the difference between\n\n16:19.480 --> 16:22.480\n theoretical computer science and software engineering.\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:24.800\n Or I don't know if you draw a distinction,\n\n16:24.800 --> 16:27.160\n but if we look into this computer world now,\n\n16:27.160 --> 16:29.680\n is there a difference between theory,\n\n16:29.680 --> 16:31.360\n things you can say formally,\n\n16:31.360 --> 16:34.760\n and the pragmatic implementation of that theory\n\n16:34.760 --> 16:37.400\n into actual systems that people use,\n\n16:37.400 --> 16:40.200\n which I guess we'll call software engineering?\n\n16:40.200 --> 16:43.280\n So the engineer, they're obsessed with the domain of,\n\n16:43.280 --> 16:44.520\n well, what do you want to accomplish\n\n16:44.520 --> 16:46.280\n and who are you accomplishing it for?\n\n16:46.280 --> 16:48.520\n So they live in the world of people,\n\n16:48.520 --> 16:49.840\n if they're good engineers.\n\n16:49.840 --> 16:52.680\n And they say, okay, what's the experience?\n\n16:52.680 --> 16:54.260\n How are we going to use this?\n\n16:54.260 --> 16:55.720\n Why are we going to do this?\n\n16:55.720 --> 16:57.240\n What's the commercial application?\n\n16:57.240 --> 16:59.120\n What's the noncommercial application?\n\n16:59.120 --> 17:01.300\n And you collect all these business requirements.\n\n17:01.300 --> 17:03.360\n And once you've done all of that,\n\n17:03.360 --> 17:06.520\n the better job you do, the more self evident it is\n\n17:06.520 --> 17:10.480\n of how do we apply the toys and tools of computer science\n\n17:10.480 --> 17:13.260\n and other such things to actually resolve that.\n\n17:13.260 --> 17:15.880\n And the point of theoretical computer science\n\n17:15.880 --> 17:17.600\n from the software engineering domain\n\n17:17.600 --> 17:20.160\n is it can tell you kind of where your guardrails are.\n\n17:20.160 --> 17:22.360\n It won't make perfect programs.\n\n17:22.360 --> 17:24.280\n And there's no such thing as that,\n\n17:24.280 --> 17:27.000\n but rather it can give you a good notion and sense\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:30.760\n that your program has some desirable properties.\n\n17:30.760 --> 17:33.340\n Like maybe you can prove that it can terminate.\n\n17:33.340 --> 17:34.960\n If you're dealing with total programs\n\n17:34.960 --> 17:37.880\n or maybe you can prove you'll never have a buffer overflow\n\n17:37.880 --> 17:41.320\n or you won't divide by zero somewhere or something like that.\n\n17:41.320 --> 17:43.120\n Some event won't occur\n\n17:43.120 --> 17:45.640\n that'll cause a catastrophic failure in your system.\n\n17:45.640 --> 17:47.680\n But there's always this combinatorial explosion\n\n17:47.680 --> 17:50.700\n between what you can test and think about\n\n17:50.700 --> 17:52.820\n and what you can actually code.\n\n17:52.820 --> 17:54.580\n So the stuff on the left hand side\n\n17:54.580 --> 17:57.700\n lives in a different cardinality, a different universe.\n\n17:57.700 --> 17:59.880\n There's something significantly larger there.\n\n17:59.880 --> 18:01.820\n And the tools on the right hand side,\n\n18:01.820 --> 18:04.600\n we have property based testing and these SAT solvers.\n\n18:04.600 --> 18:07.740\n We have all this great stuff here in formal methods land\n\n18:07.740 --> 18:09.560\n and computer science theory land,\n\n18:09.560 --> 18:11.720\n but there's only a small subset of things\n\n18:11.720 --> 18:14.580\n that they actually give you good answers about.\n\n18:14.580 --> 18:17.220\n So the balance of the two things is basically saying,\n\n18:17.220 --> 18:18.900\n well, what do you care about?\n\n18:18.900 --> 18:20.920\n And what are you okay throwing away?\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:22.680\n That's the art of engineering\n\n18:22.680 --> 18:24.800\n and building these types of things.\n\n18:24.800 --> 18:26.360\n So, you know, cryptocurrencies,\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:28.840\n we deal with these complex distributed systems\n\n18:28.840 --> 18:30.880\n that have cryptography and game theory\n\n18:30.880 --> 18:33.000\n and Byzantine actors.\n\n18:33.000 --> 18:35.000\n So the balance there is saying,\n\n18:35.000 --> 18:37.840\n okay, what can't fail in that system?\n\n18:37.840 --> 18:40.240\n And that's the kind of stuff that you want to apply\n\n18:40.240 --> 18:42.340\n as heavy a tool set as you can,\n\n18:42.340 --> 18:44.120\n because when that stuff fails,\n\n18:44.120 --> 18:46.240\n you either have a loss of billions of dollars,\n\n18:46.240 --> 18:48.560\n privacy, or potentially even life,\n\n18:48.560 --> 18:50.860\n depending on how these systems get adopted.\n\n18:50.860 --> 18:52.920\n But then other things, you know, what can fail?\n\n18:52.920 --> 18:56.320\n Is it okay if the block doesn't get made every now and then?\n\n18:56.320 --> 18:58.240\n Is it okay if your latency goes up\n\n18:58.240 --> 19:01.280\n or your network suddenly becomes asynchronous\n\n19:01.280 --> 19:03.600\n and you disconnect from it and you have to restart\n\n19:03.600 --> 19:05.400\n the computer or something like that?\n\n19:05.400 --> 19:06.560\n That's probably okay.\n\n19:06.560 --> 19:09.040\n It's an inconvenience and burden to the user.\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:10.880\n And if you actually try to chase that tail,\n\n19:10.880 --> 19:13.640\n you'll end up spending 10 years chasing phantoms and ghosts.\n\n19:13.640 --> 19:16.160\n And meanwhile, the whole world moves on.\n\n19:16.160 --> 19:18.240\n So it's really figuring out those balance of the two.\n\n19:18.240 --> 19:21.640\n And what's really beautiful is that the formal methods tools\n\n19:21.640 --> 19:23.080\n have gotten so much better\n\n19:23.080 --> 19:25.140\n over the last 20 years in particular,\n\n19:25.140 --> 19:27.640\n mostly because of incredibly high investments\n\n19:27.640 --> 19:31.040\n from Microsoft and Google and big universities,\n\n19:31.040 --> 19:34.920\n because these guys are building these gargantuan systems.\n\n19:34.920 --> 19:36.160\n If you look at the Googleplex\n\n19:36.160 --> 19:37.920\n or what Amazon has or others,\n\n19:37.920 --> 19:40.680\n and they have so much value, so many users,\n\n19:40.680 --> 19:41.780\n so many things going on,\n\n19:41.780 --> 19:44.480\n and no person can keep that in their head.\n\n19:44.480 --> 19:46.400\n And so you're talking about systems\n\n19:46.400 --> 19:48.400\n may have 10 million lines of code,\n\n19:48.400 --> 19:49.740\n 15 million lines of code,\n\n19:49.740 --> 19:51.840\n millions of nodes connecting,\n\n19:51.840 --> 19:53.600\n faulty processes happening all the time,\n\n19:53.600 --> 19:56.040\n hackers breaking in on a regular basis.\n\n19:56.040 --> 19:58.040\n So when you're trying to model all of that,\n\n19:58.040 --> 19:59.200\n trying to ask yourself,\n\n19:59.200 --> 20:01.720\n what formal guarantees and properties can I get\n\n20:01.720 --> 20:04.400\n to simplify this system as much as possible?\n\n20:04.400 --> 20:06.400\n So instead of the applications of formal methods\n\n20:06.400 --> 20:08.040\n slowing you down, in many cases,\n\n20:08.040 --> 20:11.160\n it actually massively reduces your debugging time\n\n20:11.160 --> 20:13.200\n and your ability to find where errors occur.\n\n20:13.200 --> 20:15.440\n In some cases, you can't find where errors occur\n\n20:15.440 --> 20:17.360\n inside these massive concurrent systems.\n\n20:17.360 --> 20:19.320\n And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?\n\n20:19.320 --> 20:21.460\n We're talking about just the same thing.\n\n20:21.460 --> 20:22.300\n But we're talking about\n\n20:22.300 --> 20:24.920\n a much more hostile operating environment,\n\n20:24.920 --> 20:27.400\n where instead of it running in a pristine data center\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:28.780\n in California somewhere,\n\n20:28.780 --> 20:30.280\n it's running on your cell phone,\n\n20:30.280 --> 20:31.480\n it's running on your mom's phone,\n\n20:31.480 --> 20:32.500\n it's running your dad's phone,\n\n20:32.500 --> 20:35.340\n it's running on some computer in Mongolia\n\n20:35.340 --> 20:37.640\n that may have good internet on Tuesday,\n\n20:37.640 --> 20:39.180\n but not any other day.\n\n20:39.180 --> 20:40.800\n So when you live in that kind of environment,\n\n20:40.800 --> 20:42.720\n you really do need to think carefully\n\n20:42.720 --> 20:44.760\n about a whole new class of protocols.\n\n20:44.760 --> 20:46.120\n And then you need to think carefully\n\n20:46.120 --> 20:48.180\n about a whole new class of tools and techniques\n\n20:48.180 --> 20:50.560\n to test the reliability of those systems.\n\n20:50.560 --> 20:52.960\n And you need to separate the world and say,\n\n20:52.960 --> 20:55.160\n what is high assurance and cannot fail?\n\n20:55.160 --> 20:57.400\n Because if it fails, people lose money.\n\n20:57.400 --> 20:58.700\n And what is low assurance?\n\n20:58.700 --> 21:01.260\n And it's okay if that falls apart.\n\n21:01.260 --> 21:02.100\n The other thing I'll mention\n\n21:02.100 --> 21:05.360\n is there are perverse financial incentives in our industry.\n\n21:05.360 --> 21:07.760\n Because the reality is when something blows up,\n\n21:07.760 --> 21:09.580\n the people who built those things that blow up\n\n21:09.580 --> 21:11.280\n usually get paid upfront.\n\n21:11.280 --> 21:13.760\n So what they're focusing on is time to market,\n\n21:13.760 --> 21:16.160\n speed to market, and getting tokens out\n\n21:16.160 --> 21:18.200\n and getting them liquid.\n\n21:18.200 --> 21:20.080\n And then people come in, they buy it,\n\n21:20.080 --> 21:22.640\n but if there's a nascent bug in some DeFi protocol,\n\n21:22.640 --> 21:24.480\n it'll probably be discovered six months later\n\n21:24.480 --> 21:25.580\n or something like that.\n\n21:25.580 --> 21:27.280\n It blows up, who suffers?\n\n21:27.280 --> 21:28.120\n The users.\n\n21:28.120 --> 21:30.320\n The people that created that already got paid.\n\n21:30.320 --> 21:31.960\n Exactly, that's why you pay the guy\n\n21:31.960 --> 21:34.860\n who makes the breaks software for your train last.\n\n21:34.860 --> 21:37.160\n And you make sure he rides the train every day.\n\n21:37.160 --> 21:41.800\n So you're basically describing the complexity\n\n21:41.800 --> 21:45.920\n of a distributed system that's fundamentally game theoretic.\n\n21:45.920 --> 21:48.240\n And like, if we think about turtles all the way down,\n\n21:48.240 --> 21:49.360\n it's humans all the way down.\n\n21:49.360 --> 21:52.800\n I mean, at the very bottom is still human nature.\n\n21:52.800 --> 21:57.800\n Is there something you can say formally about human nature\n\n21:58.640 --> 22:00.000\n to try, you said you can't,\n\n22:00.000 --> 22:02.880\n there's certain parts of the system that can't fail.\n\n22:02.880 --> 22:05.800\n Some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way,\n\n22:05.800 --> 22:08.160\n that there's this game theoretic construction\n\n22:08.160 --> 22:10.000\n of mutually assured destruction.\n\n22:10.000 --> 22:12.160\n Oh, that rhymes, see, I'm a poet.\n\n22:12.160 --> 22:15.920\n That system can't fail because you're gonna blow everyone up\n\n22:15.920 --> 22:18.440\n but you can't formally say for sure\n\n22:18.440 --> 22:20.560\n it's not going to fail.\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:24.200\n So like, you're basically trying to chase,\n\n22:24.200 --> 22:26.200\n like statistically reduce the probability\n\n22:26.200 --> 22:29.480\n that these particular critical aspects will fail.\n\n22:29.480 --> 22:32.400\n And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world\n\n22:32.400 --> 22:35.040\n at small scale to see where things go wrong.\n\n22:35.040 --> 22:36.360\n Yeah, it's a great question.\n\n22:36.360 --> 22:39.280\n And the problem with game theory and mechanism design\n\n22:39.280 --> 22:42.120\n is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor.\n\n22:42.120 --> 22:43.140\n And I don't think in my life\n\n22:43.140 --> 22:44.880\n I've ever met a rational actor.\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:46.400\n There's a rational actor on Tuesday,\n\n22:46.400 --> 22:49.040\n but any other day of the week, who the hell knows?\n\n22:49.040 --> 22:50.920\n And there's even, I think there was a book Freakonomics\n\n22:50.920 --> 22:51.880\n and there's a few of these things\n\n22:51.880 --> 22:53.400\n where it just shows again and again\n\n22:53.400 --> 22:55.560\n where people behave in ways\n\n22:55.560 --> 22:57.400\n that are against their best interest.\n\n22:57.400 --> 22:59.360\n So then you have these protocol designers and they say,\n\n22:59.360 --> 23:02.400\n well, we need an honest majority for this thing to work.\n\n23:02.400 --> 23:05.200\n And they say, okay, well, we'll create this incentive model\n\n23:05.200 --> 23:08.560\n and rational actors will behave with that incentive model.\n\n23:08.560 --> 23:10.360\n And they say, well, the individual won't do that\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:13.960\n but the firm, the government, the entity will.\n\n23:13.960 --> 23:16.240\n The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples\n\n23:16.240 --> 23:20.280\n where the system was actually behaving in weird ways.\n\n23:20.280 --> 23:22.880\n Like we almost completely eradicated the human population\n\n23:22.880 --> 23:24.720\n twice in the 20th century,\n\n23:24.720 --> 23:26.400\n once during the Cuban missile crisis.\n\n23:26.400 --> 23:29.220\n And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian Colonel\n\n23:29.220 --> 23:32.060\n and they installed a new satellite system and it said,\n\n23:32.060 --> 23:34.160\n hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us.\n\n23:34.160 --> 23:35.480\n You need to turn the key in,\n\n23:35.480 --> 23:36.840\n launch all the missiles in the silo.\n\n23:36.840 --> 23:38.480\n And he said, oh, that's not right.\n\n23:38.480 --> 23:39.440\n That doesn't seem right.\n\n23:39.440 --> 23:42.560\n And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles.\n\n23:42.560 --> 23:45.840\n So in both cases, a single person stood\n\n23:45.840 --> 23:48.320\n against the systems of superpowers\n\n23:48.320 --> 23:50.940\n between us and nuclear annihilation.\n\n23:50.940 --> 23:53.340\n So in general, we're really bad\n\n23:53.340 --> 23:55.360\n at building these types of things.\n\n23:55.360 --> 23:57.080\n So what you look for instead is say,\n\n23:57.080 --> 23:59.100\n can the system be self correcting?\n\n23:59.100 --> 24:01.400\n It's not about avoiding a problem.\n\n24:01.400 --> 24:04.400\n It's more about can the problem be resolved?\n\n24:04.400 --> 24:06.320\n And that's how nature engineers things.\n\n24:06.320 --> 24:07.680\n It gives you an immune system.\n\n24:07.680 --> 24:09.320\n It gives you the ability to heal.\n\n24:09.320 --> 24:13.160\n If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event,\n\n24:13.160 --> 24:16.520\n the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up.\n\n24:16.520 --> 24:18.240\n So it's a better question of how do you align\n\n24:18.240 --> 24:20.460\n the incentives over the longterm of a system\n\n24:20.460 --> 24:22.520\n where all the actors within the system,\n\n24:22.520 --> 24:24.880\n when an event occurs that disrupts it,\n\n24:24.880 --> 24:26.400\n have an incentive to push it back\n\n24:26.400 --> 24:29.520\n into a healthy, productive, useful state,\n\n24:29.520 --> 24:32.580\n which is going back kind of to that complexity theory stuff\n\n24:32.580 --> 24:35.280\n that we began with and a little bit about,\n\n24:35.280 --> 24:37.560\n how do you handle modern economics?\n\n24:37.560 --> 24:41.160\n Like for example, we knew this coming into the COVID crisis\n\n24:41.160 --> 24:43.960\n that there would be catastrophic economic disruption\n\n24:43.960 --> 24:45.060\n throughout the entire world.\n\n24:45.060 --> 24:48.120\n In the developed world, it was print lots of money\n\n24:48.120 --> 24:49.520\n and hope to God it works.\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:52.060\n In the developing world is try not to starve to death.\n\n24:52.060 --> 24:55.400\n Over 100 million people were pushed into acute starvation.\n\n24:55.400 --> 24:58.200\n So acute hunger, it's a terrible situation.\n\n24:58.200 --> 25:00.520\n But every economist knew we were going into that.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:02.260\n So the question is how do you restart the system?\n\n25:02.260 --> 25:04.240\n How do you realign the system and so forth\n\n25:04.240 --> 25:08.180\n and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some point.\n\n25:08.180 --> 25:11.180\n So it's an imperfect, inexact science.\n\n25:11.180 --> 25:12.280\n And that's actually one of the things\n\n25:12.280 --> 25:14.060\n that makes our industry so much fun\n\n25:14.060 --> 25:16.840\n is that these are kind of like micro experiments\n\n25:16.840 --> 25:18.960\n for the macro.\n\n25:18.960 --> 25:22.360\n In the years past, you never got a chance to experiment\n\n25:22.360 --> 25:23.980\n with monetary policy.\n\n25:23.980 --> 25:25.720\n I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years,\n\n25:25.720 --> 25:26.720\n you'd have some conference,\n\n25:26.720 --> 25:28.840\n usually in a cool island like Jamaica\n\n25:28.840 --> 25:31.160\n and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy\n\n25:31.160 --> 25:33.080\n and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement.\n\n25:33.080 --> 25:35.560\n And these would be nation states, invitation only.\n\n25:35.560 --> 25:37.600\n And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies\n\n25:37.600 --> 25:39.760\n floating around all with their own monetary policy\n\n25:39.760 --> 25:42.140\n and their rules and it's very Darwinian.\n\n25:42.140 --> 25:44.360\n A lot are dying, some are succeeding.\n\n25:44.360 --> 25:46.760\n Anomalies happen like Dogecoin and you say,\n\n25:46.760 --> 25:48.760\n God, is this temporary, is this permanent?\n\n25:48.760 --> 25:51.000\n Why doesn't this horrible thing die?\n\n25:51.000 --> 25:52.400\n And then other things you think\n\n25:52.400 --> 25:54.240\n would be absolutely successful\n\n25:54.240 --> 25:56.360\n and just take off and be in the top 10\n\n25:56.360 --> 25:57.840\n don't really get as much traction.\n\n25:57.840 --> 26:00.000\n Like Al Grant is a great example of that.\n\n26:00.000 --> 26:03.080\n I mean, Silvio, he's an incredibly bright guy.\n\n26:03.080 --> 26:04.940\n Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner\n\n26:04.940 --> 26:07.800\n and his work is legendary\n\n26:07.800 --> 26:09.400\n and it's just beautiful and elegant\n\n26:09.400 --> 26:11.520\n and he literally has all the people.\n\n26:11.520 --> 26:12.880\n He went and hired Tal Robin\n\n26:12.880 --> 26:16.120\n and she got at IBM Research and Craig Gentry,\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:17.480\n the guy who did homomorphic encryption\n\n26:17.480 --> 26:18.560\n under Dan Boneh is there.\n\n26:18.560 --> 26:20.920\n There's all these amazing people on that team\n\n26:20.920 --> 26:22.860\n and they have money in the VCs.\n\n26:22.860 --> 26:25.400\n So you'd say, okay, that's a contender.\n\n26:25.400 --> 26:27.660\n But if you look at market adoption,\n\n26:27.660 --> 26:30.120\n Ethereum Classic sometimes is above it\n\n26:30.120 --> 26:31.040\n and other things are above it.\n\n26:31.040 --> 26:35.100\n And then there's this weird Darwinian evolution produced\n\n26:35.100 --> 26:38.760\n Dogecoin organism that's just stomping all around.\n\n26:38.760 --> 26:40.000\n Evolution doesn't make sense.\n\n26:40.000 --> 26:43.520\n Exactly, but maybe it's worth the problem, not evolution,\n\n26:43.520 --> 26:44.680\n because the market's the market\n\n26:44.680 --> 26:48.800\n and you can scream and cry and pout\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:50.900\n and stamp your foot and say this makes no sense,\n\n26:50.900 --> 26:52.840\n but that's the way the world works.\n\n26:52.840 --> 26:54.540\n There's plenty of mountain climbers\n\n26:54.540 --> 26:56.360\n that didn't want gravity to apply to them\n\n26:56.360 --> 26:58.840\n and it's the same situation here.\n\n26:58.840 --> 27:00.520\n There's plenty of people in these marketplaces\n\n27:00.520 --> 27:02.360\n that had the best of intentions, the best team,\n\n27:02.360 --> 27:04.440\n the best technology, and for whatever reason,\n\n27:04.440 --> 27:06.760\n they didn't get that adoption.\n\n27:06.760 --> 27:08.400\n So the question isn't the local,\n\n27:08.400 --> 27:12.680\n it should be the longterm and will the system over time\n\n27:12.680 --> 27:15.180\n converge to a state that actually is useful\n\n27:15.180 --> 27:17.840\n and meaningful to society and actually solve problems\n\n27:17.840 --> 27:20.460\n for it and that's what we try to figure out\n\n27:20.460 --> 27:22.840\n is how do we perturb these things in a way\n\n27:22.840 --> 27:24.800\n to kind of push them in that direction.\n\n27:24.800 --> 27:27.800\n So before we go into this fascinating\n\n27:27.800 --> 27:31.240\n Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies,\n\n27:31.240 --> 27:34.360\n let me ask you sort of a basic programming question.\n\n27:34.360 --> 27:37.160\n There's a fascinating aspect to your work with Cardano\n\n27:37.160 --> 27:41.160\n that use Haskell to build the infrastructure,\n\n27:41.160 --> 27:44.860\n but even stepping back more, looking at this landscape,\n\n27:44.860 --> 27:48.680\n another place where Darwinian evolution operates,\n\n27:48.680 --> 27:51.640\n looking at this landscape of programming languages,\n\n27:51.640 --> 27:55.520\n you as an engineer, you as a philosopher, both,\n\n27:55.520 --> 27:58.720\n what programming languages do you think are interesting\n\n27:58.720 --> 28:01.160\n and more practically, what programming languages,\n\n28:01.160 --> 28:05.000\n if you were to advise like students today, should they learn?\n\n28:05.000 --> 28:08.680\n Yeah, so there's the pedagogy of learning how to program\n\n28:08.680 --> 28:11.120\n and to express the theory of computer science.\n\n28:11.120 --> 28:12.960\n Like you have to learn how to write algorithms,\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:14.800\n you have to learn what data structures are,\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:16.960\n you have to be able to do analysis of these things\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:21.140\n and that probably the, I think the debate is over Python\n\n28:21.140 --> 28:24.140\n is probably the best language or JavaScript\n\n28:24.140 --> 28:26.120\n to get started with because they're very useful,\n\n28:26.120 --> 28:27.440\n the libraries are amazing,\n\n28:27.440 --> 28:29.800\n there's just tons of online materials,\n\n28:29.800 --> 28:32.200\n even MIT is now teaching their introduction\n\n28:32.200 --> 28:35.600\n to computer science in Python and they used to do Lisp,\n\n28:35.600 --> 28:37.320\n I mean, these guys were hardcore.\n\n28:37.320 --> 28:38.160\n I still love Lisp.\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:41.000\n Oh man, it's great, these are your father's parentheses,\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:44.760\n they're elegant weapons from a time long ago.\n\n28:44.760 --> 28:46.680\n But that's a great starting point\n\n28:46.680 --> 28:49.280\n and it's not about falling in love with a language,\n\n28:49.280 --> 28:50.960\n it's just falling in love with computing,\n\n28:50.960 --> 28:53.560\n it's about falling in love with having a dialogue\n\n28:53.560 --> 28:55.240\n with a computer and thinking about,\n\n28:55.240 --> 28:56.480\n well, how would I solve that?\n\n28:56.480 --> 28:57.860\n How would I interact with that?\n\n28:57.860 --> 28:59.720\n What does this need to look like?\n\n29:00.860 --> 29:02.780\n Functional programming is what we've chosen to use\n\n29:02.780 --> 29:06.360\n for Cardano mostly because we're living in the academic\n\n29:06.360 --> 29:08.720\n world, we've written 105 papers and the problem is\n\n29:08.720 --> 29:11.600\n you have to translate that work into code\n\n29:11.600 --> 29:14.000\n and the gap between an imperative language\n\n29:14.000 --> 29:18.280\n like a C++ or C and these academic rigorous papers\n\n29:18.280 --> 29:20.960\n is extremely large and so there's gonna be\n\n29:20.960 --> 29:23.520\n a lot of semantical ambiguity between those two\n\n29:23.520 --> 29:26.080\n and what I mean by that is that you might end up\n\n29:26.080 --> 29:28.800\n implementing a wrong thing.\n\n29:28.800 --> 29:31.480\n You might think that what you've built is the paper\n\n29:31.480 --> 29:33.720\n but the computer's not going to tell you that\n\n29:33.720 --> 29:35.220\n because the paper's written in prose\n\n29:35.220 --> 29:37.540\n and maybe typed up in LaTeX or something\n\n29:37.540 --> 29:40.200\n but there's no proof chain, evidence chain\n\n29:40.200 --> 29:42.360\n that you can show that there's no ambiguity.\n\n29:42.360 --> 29:43.660\n When you look at a functional language,\n\n29:43.660 --> 29:47.240\n you're a little closer to math and so as a consequence,\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:49.680\n the translation of the papers that we spent\n\n29:49.680 --> 29:52.160\n so damn long writing and writing proofs about\n\n29:52.160 --> 29:55.440\n and so forth to code is much smaller.\n\n29:55.440 --> 29:57.280\n Now the downside is these functional languages\n\n29:57.280 --> 29:59.840\n tend to be a bit more academic and they tend to have\n\n29:59.840 --> 30:02.000\n not necessarily the best Windows support\n\n30:02.000 --> 30:03.200\n and the libraries aren't so good\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:04.920\n and also they tend to be a little slower\n\n30:04.920 --> 30:07.360\n when compared as a whole on average\n\n30:07.360 --> 30:10.000\n to languages like C for example.\n\n30:10.000 --> 30:11.800\n So it's really a question of okay,\n\n30:11.800 --> 30:14.080\n what are you designing for for version one?\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:16.160\n Are you designing for performance\n\n30:16.160 --> 30:19.000\n and are you designing for developer accessibility\n\n30:19.000 --> 30:21.120\n or are you designing for correctness\n\n30:21.120 --> 30:26.120\n and are you designing for a high fidelity representation\n\n30:26.800 --> 30:27.840\n of the protocol?\n\n30:27.840 --> 30:32.120\n Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one\n\n30:32.120 --> 30:34.160\n because we knew that the kinds of people\n\n30:34.160 --> 30:36.360\n who think about that are also the kinds of people\n\n30:36.360 --> 30:38.240\n that would have an easy time reading a paper\n\n30:38.240 --> 30:41.440\n like Ouroboros and working their way through all of this\n\n30:41.440 --> 30:43.200\n and they would do a pretty good job\n\n30:43.200 --> 30:45.040\n running a formal specification\n\n30:45.040 --> 30:47.640\n and then translating that into running code.\n\n30:47.640 --> 30:49.840\n Then once you have that, you have a blueprint\n\n30:49.840 --> 30:52.400\n that you can actually reason about, maintain\n\n30:52.400 --> 30:53.560\n and if you really wanted to,\n\n30:53.560 --> 30:55.880\n you could then turn that into a Rust code base\n\n30:55.880 --> 30:57.640\n or into a Java code base.\n\n30:57.640 --> 31:00.720\n Going the other way around would be kind of pointless\n\n31:00.720 --> 31:01.960\n and counterproductive.\n\n31:01.960 --> 31:06.520\n The other side of it is that Haskell code\n\n31:06.520 --> 31:09.640\n or functional code tends to be significantly more concise\n\n31:09.640 --> 31:12.040\n and I actually have a real life example of that.\n\n31:12.040 --> 31:14.080\n So if you take a look at Mantis,\n\n31:14.080 --> 31:17.880\n we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala.\n\n31:17.880 --> 31:21.080\n It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code\n\n31:21.080 --> 31:23.400\n and you compare that with like C++ Bitcoin,\n\n31:23.400 --> 31:26.560\n I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code.\n\n31:26.560 --> 31:28.640\n So it's almost 10 times smaller\n\n31:28.640 --> 31:31.120\n and so less code, less to read\n\n31:31.120 --> 31:33.160\n and you tend to read code significantly more\n\n31:33.160 --> 31:36.520\n than you would read write code.\n\n31:36.520 --> 31:39.280\n So it's always an advantage for a maintenance,\n\n31:39.280 --> 31:42.800\n understandability, documentation and other sort of things\n\n31:42.800 --> 31:45.200\n when you have more concise code bases\n\n31:45.200 --> 31:50.200\n and also it's a lot easier for you to apply stronger tools\n\n31:50.240 --> 31:53.440\n to a functional code base like static analysis\n\n31:53.440 --> 31:55.960\n or property based testing or these types of things\n\n31:55.960 --> 31:57.320\n than an imperative code base.\n\n31:57.320 --> 31:59.960\n But the thing is, it's almost like a religion\n\n31:59.960 --> 32:01.760\n or language, it's like saying,\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:03.880\n French versus Russian versus English,\n\n32:03.880 --> 32:05.080\n everybody has their adherence.\n\n32:05.080 --> 32:07.400\n They say, oh, they have the best poetry here.\n\n32:07.400 --> 32:08.640\n Russian, yeah, wins.\n\n32:08.640 --> 32:10.280\n There you go, always a Russian.\n\n32:10.280 --> 32:11.960\n Everybody has their favorite tools\n\n32:11.960 --> 32:14.080\n and their favorite languages,\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:15.800\n but it just comes down to what problems\n\n32:15.800 --> 32:16.840\n are you trying to solve\n\n32:16.840 --> 32:18.320\n and what problem domain do you live in?\n\n32:18.320 --> 32:21.360\n If you're inventing new protocols based on science,\n\n32:21.360 --> 32:23.200\n you're gonna take the time to write a paper,\n\n32:23.200 --> 32:25.400\n go through the peer review process\n\n32:25.400 --> 32:26.480\n as you've done personally,\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:28.680\n you know how hard it can be to get into a conference\n\n32:28.680 --> 32:30.920\n and go through that and get your ass kicked.\n\n32:30.920 --> 32:34.920\n Then you also have to apply the exact same level of care\n\n32:34.920 --> 32:37.600\n to the engineering side in terms of implementation of that\n\n32:37.600 --> 32:39.080\n or else you will make a mistake\n\n32:39.080 --> 32:41.720\n and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system\n\n32:41.720 --> 32:44.640\n that destroys the security properties of the system.\n\n32:44.640 --> 32:46.080\n So we really had no choice\n\n32:46.080 --> 32:48.280\n but to go to some notion of functional.\n\n32:48.280 --> 32:50.600\n The question was, what's the Goldilocks language?\n\n32:50.600 --> 32:53.560\n Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F Sharp\n\n32:53.560 --> 32:56.440\n or Clojure where you still have some connection\n\n32:56.440 --> 33:00.080\n to understandable things like.NET or the JVM?\n\n33:00.080 --> 33:03.920\n Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris\n\n33:03.920 --> 33:06.200\n or Agda or, you know, Isabel?\n\n33:06.200 --> 33:09.160\n And there you can really dial up the correctness\n\n33:09.160 --> 33:10.840\n and write all kinds of crazy proofs.\n\n33:10.840 --> 33:12.760\n But by the way, it's like the seven people\n\n33:12.760 --> 33:15.100\n who write your code, they go on vacation a lot,\n\n33:15.100 --> 33:16.700\n you'll never get anything done.\n\n33:16.700 --> 33:19.360\n So Haskell kind of felt like a nice mill ground\n\n33:19.360 --> 33:22.200\n between those two where if we needed to pull into the left,\n\n33:22.200 --> 33:24.180\n we could, if you wanted to pull into the right,\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:25.320\n you could as well.\n\n33:25.320 --> 33:27.040\n That said, it's really amazing to see\n\n33:27.040 --> 33:28.560\n what the hybrid languages have done.\n\n33:28.560 --> 33:30.580\n If I was a new student in computer science\n\n33:30.580 --> 33:32.720\n and I said, you know, learn any language\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:34.880\n to grow your career from,\n\n33:34.880 --> 33:37.760\n Scala 3 is probably the language to go with.\n\n33:37.760 --> 33:38.600\n Yeah, it's great,\n\n33:38.600 --> 33:41.000\n because it's like you want it to be like Java, it's Java.\n\n33:41.000 --> 33:42.680\n And it looks kind of like a Java program.\n\n33:42.680 --> 33:44.840\n You want it to be like Python and scripted\n\n33:44.840 --> 33:46.980\n and you reuse a REPL, you can do that.\n\n33:46.980 --> 33:50.320\n You want to go hardcore dot, you know,\n\n33:50.320 --> 33:53.400\n dependent object types and do like weird proofs and stuff\n\n33:53.400 --> 33:55.160\n and the functional, you do all that.\n\n33:55.160 --> 33:56.920\n You have access to all of these things\n\n33:56.920 --> 33:58.760\n and Martin Niederski is a brilliant guy.\n\n33:58.760 --> 34:01.320\n He's done some phenomenal work basically,\n\n34:01.320 --> 34:03.400\n because he was one guy who created the JVM\n\n34:03.400 --> 34:06.440\n and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years.\n\n34:06.440 --> 34:08.640\n He did a lot of really hardcore work\n\n34:08.640 --> 34:12.080\n in trying to build a concise, nice, modern language\n\n34:12.080 --> 34:13.900\n that does a little bit of everything.\n\n34:13.900 --> 34:17.600\n And it's got great applications in data science and AI.\n\n34:17.600 --> 34:20.240\n It's also heavily used in modern companies,\n\n34:20.240 --> 34:21.640\n like Netflix uses Scala\n\n34:21.640 --> 34:23.920\n for all of their microservice architecture.\n\n34:23.920 --> 34:27.120\n Yeah, so that's a great language and it's easy to pick up\n\n34:27.120 --> 34:28.760\n and it's easy to hire people into it.\n\n34:28.760 --> 34:30.480\n You just find these Eastern European guys\n\n34:30.480 --> 34:32.600\n who were Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years,\n\n34:32.600 --> 34:34.960\n they got tired of making $20 an hour,\n\n34:34.960 --> 34:38.280\n so they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour\n\n34:38.280 --> 34:39.920\n and they're really good at it.\n\n34:39.920 --> 34:41.440\n And that's a great gateway drug\n\n34:41.440 --> 34:43.400\n because you have like QuickCheck and Haskell,\n\n34:43.400 --> 34:45.320\n you have ScalaCheck and Scala.\n\n34:45.320 --> 34:47.300\n You can also do model checking.\n\n34:47.300 --> 34:49.680\n You can also go and use a TLA spec\n\n34:49.680 --> 34:52.040\n and make it work with Scala and so forth.\n\n34:52.040 --> 34:54.720\n So it gets you a little bit of everything\n\n34:54.720 --> 34:58.920\n and you can then move around that entire design space\n\n34:58.920 --> 34:59.940\n in a beautiful way.\n\n34:59.940 --> 35:04.940\n So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go vanilla,\n\n35:05.700 --> 35:07.380\n you go Python and JavaScript.\n\n35:07.380 --> 35:08.380\n When you're getting started.\n\n35:08.380 --> 35:09.200\n It's the getting started.\n\n35:09.200 --> 35:10.040\n That'll get you everything.\n\n35:10.040 --> 35:11.900\n You can do web scrapers and anything.\n\n35:11.900 --> 35:12.740\n It's just fun.\n\n35:12.740 --> 35:14.620\n All this experiment with drugs in undergrad,\n\n35:14.620 --> 35:17.460\n this was where Scala 3 comes in, it's a gateway drug\n\n35:17.460 --> 35:19.900\n to then potentially more hardcore functional languages\n\n35:19.900 --> 35:21.380\n like Haskell.\n\n35:21.380 --> 35:24.240\n Do you think C and C++, C++ still has a role?\n\n35:24.240 --> 35:26.780\n No, I think Rust is completely replaced, a need for them.\n\n35:26.780 --> 35:30.100\n Go and Rust, those are the two twins of doom.\n\n35:30.100 --> 35:33.340\n I mean, Google created Go just to get rid of C.\n\n35:33.340 --> 35:34.700\n They hated C that much.\n\n35:34.700 --> 35:37.220\n And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as well.\n\n35:37.220 --> 35:39.220\n Hate can be a great motivator.\n\n35:39.220 --> 35:41.920\n Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic.\n\n35:41.920 --> 35:43.220\n We're going depth first today.\n\n35:43.220 --> 35:44.060\n Sure.\n\n35:45.320 --> 35:47.700\n As a developer, why should I be incentivized\n\n35:47.700 --> 35:50.040\n to create Cardano based applications?\n\n35:50.040 --> 35:52.480\n What is on the Cardano developer roadmap?\n\n35:52.480 --> 35:54.740\n Any other language, I guess this is the key question\n\n35:54.740 --> 35:55.580\n I wanna ask.\n\n35:55.580 --> 35:58.620\n Any other language support other than Haskell?\n\n35:58.620 --> 36:01.540\n The example this person gives is TypeScript,\n\n36:01.540 --> 36:04.300\n Go, Java, Python, et cetera.\n\n36:04.300 --> 36:06.580\n Also, have you considered a yearly conference\n\n36:06.580 --> 36:07.860\n focused around developers?\n\n36:07.860 --> 36:10.180\n Ha ha, yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest.\n\n36:10.180 --> 36:14.780\n And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can't remember.\n\n36:14.780 --> 36:17.380\n And we were gonna do one last year, but then COVID hit.\n\n36:17.380 --> 36:19.500\n So we'll bring it back and we'll probably do it annually\n\n36:19.500 --> 36:22.140\n at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there.\n\n36:22.140 --> 36:24.060\n In fact, it just so happens that coincides\n\n36:24.060 --> 36:24.980\n with the Goguen Summit.\n\n36:24.980 --> 36:28.140\n So we're doing that, I think the third week of September.\n\n36:28.140 --> 36:29.880\n But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference.\n\n36:29.880 --> 36:31.500\n You can bring a lot of cool people together\n\n36:31.500 --> 36:34.780\n and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth.\n\n36:34.780 --> 36:36.460\n But to the question in particular,\n\n36:36.460 --> 36:38.540\n Plutus is like any other language.\n\n36:38.540 --> 36:41.040\n Plutus core, you can compile things into it.\n\n36:41.040 --> 36:43.620\n So it's entirely possible to write a Scala\n\n36:43.620 --> 36:46.180\n to Plutus core compiler or TypeScript compiler\n\n36:46.180 --> 36:47.340\n or something like that.\n\n36:47.340 --> 36:51.300\n But I'm a big believer of separation of concerns\n\n36:51.300 --> 36:54.660\n and we don't live in a single chain model anymore.\n\n36:54.660 --> 36:59.020\n So you have a situation where you probably wanna have\n\n36:59.020 --> 37:01.660\n different execution environments and different chains.\n\n37:01.660 --> 37:03.260\n So you have different virtual machines there.\n\n37:03.260 --> 37:04.580\n And that's why we work so closely\n\n37:04.580 --> 37:06.460\n with the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign,\n\n37:06.460 --> 37:09.420\n Kagori Roshu's team at runtime verification.\n\n37:09.420 --> 37:10.360\n What they did is they said,\n\n37:10.360 --> 37:12.820\n let's start with something very familiar, LLVM,\n\n37:12.820 --> 37:14.420\n which has been around for a really long time\n\n37:14.420 --> 37:17.380\n and they happened to have created it there with Apple.\n\n37:17.380 --> 37:19.440\n And let's take that and translate that\n\n37:19.440 --> 37:21.080\n into the blockchain space.\n\n37:21.080 --> 37:23.020\n Okay, then once you have it,\n\n37:23.020 --> 37:26.060\n then it's very easy to modify compilers\n\n37:26.060 --> 37:28.740\n of standard languages like the C's and C++'s\n\n37:28.740 --> 37:31.780\n and other things that do compile to LLVM already\n\n37:31.780 --> 37:33.060\n and have them run there.\n\n37:33.060 --> 37:34.680\n So that's a different execution model\n\n37:34.680 --> 37:36.260\n than what we tried to build for Plutus,\n\n37:36.260 --> 37:38.900\n which focuses on correctness, okay?\n\n37:38.900 --> 37:40.860\n So then all you have to really do is say,\n\n37:40.860 --> 37:44.300\n can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?\n\n37:44.300 --> 37:46.140\n Because then you kind of, and I did a video,\n\n37:46.140 --> 37:48.100\n it was called like the island, the ocean, the pond.\n\n37:48.100 --> 37:49.900\n And the basic idea was say,\n\n37:49.900 --> 37:51.780\n you have an island where everything's perfect.\n\n37:51.780 --> 37:54.940\n Calypso lives there, life is great.\n\n37:54.940 --> 37:56.420\n People feed you grapes every day,\n\n37:56.420 --> 37:58.940\n but maybe you can't do everything on the island.\n\n37:58.940 --> 38:01.500\n And the ocean's big, it has everything,\n\n38:01.500 --> 38:04.100\n but the ocean's got sea monsters and sharks\n\n38:04.100 --> 38:08.320\n and Boaty McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?\n\n38:08.320 --> 38:10.020\n So that's what Yella is about.\n\n38:10.020 --> 38:12.780\n It's basically this bring LLVM into our world.\n\n38:12.780 --> 38:14.980\n And at some point in the next three to five year time\n\n38:14.980 --> 38:18.340\n horizon, we can bring modern programming languages in,\n\n38:18.340 --> 38:20.420\n but they're gonna come in with all their flaws\n\n38:20.420 --> 38:22.300\n and their warts and their problems.\n\n38:22.300 --> 38:25.380\n And then the pond was the idea\n\n38:25.380 --> 38:26.640\n of the Ethereum virtual machine.\n\n38:26.640 --> 38:28.220\n There's some network effect around it\n\n38:28.220 --> 38:29.340\n and there's some great tooling\n\n38:29.340 --> 38:31.100\n that's materialized and evolved.\n\n38:31.100 --> 38:33.580\n And it's not clear if that's the standard yet,\n\n38:33.580 --> 38:35.700\n or if like MySpace or Blackberry\n\n38:35.700 --> 38:37.680\n or all of these other things, it'll fade away.\n\n38:37.680 --> 38:39.880\n Well, if it becomes the standard, okay,\n\n38:39.880 --> 38:42.980\n don't fight nature, just support it.\n\n38:42.980 --> 38:44.700\n And the same thing that gives you the ability\n\n38:44.700 --> 38:48.820\n to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability\n\n38:48.820 --> 38:51.420\n to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models\n\n38:51.420 --> 38:54.920\n and they're encapsulated, bulkheaded, separated systems,\n\n38:54.920 --> 38:57.500\n but you can move ADA applications,\n\n38:57.500 --> 38:59.860\n information between those two systems.\n\n38:59.860 --> 39:01.780\n And so your main chain will always stay\n\n39:01.780 --> 39:04.500\n somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:06.340\n of expressiveness required on it\n\n39:06.340 --> 39:08.900\n to do all kinds of interesting things.\n\n39:08.900 --> 39:10.380\n And also for interoperability,\n\n39:10.380 --> 39:12.940\n be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things,\n\n39:12.940 --> 39:15.140\n but it's not trying to be everything to everyone.\n\n39:15.140 --> 39:18.160\n There's never gonna be an ice cream store in the island.\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:19.780\n You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women,\n\n39:19.780 --> 39:21.460\n but no ice cream.\n\n39:21.460 --> 39:23.700\n Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream.\n\n39:23.700 --> 39:26.780\n So just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms,\n\n39:26.780 --> 39:28.380\n for the record, what is Plutus?\n\n39:28.380 --> 39:29.760\n So Plutus is a programming language.\n\n39:29.760 --> 39:33.520\n It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell.\n\n39:33.520 --> 39:38.020\n And basically we wrote it after spending about three years\n\n39:38.020 --> 39:40.060\n thinking about all smart contracts.\n\n39:40.060 --> 39:41.860\n We were trying to figure out like,\n\n39:41.860 --> 39:44.460\n what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?\n\n39:44.460 --> 39:45.300\n And then we started thinking, well,\n\n39:45.300 --> 39:46.420\n what is a smart contract?\n\n39:46.420 --> 39:48.100\n Is it the whole application,\n\n39:48.100 --> 39:50.960\n or is it just like a sub module within an application?\n\n39:50.960 --> 39:54.100\n And usually it's the latter more than the former.\n\n39:54.100 --> 39:56.840\n You can build a self contained program like a script,\n\n39:56.840 --> 39:58.620\n but usually what's happening is you'll have it\n\n39:58.620 --> 40:00.620\n like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft\n\n40:00.620 --> 40:01.720\n or something like that.\n\n40:01.720 --> 40:04.620\n You say, hey, maybe I wanna actually create gold\n\n40:04.620 --> 40:07.860\n in World of Warcraft that's actually a currency.\n\n40:07.860 --> 40:09.740\n Okay, so I'm gonna issue a token.\n\n40:09.740 --> 40:11.660\n Well, and then maybe I wanna create some mechanics\n\n40:11.660 --> 40:14.360\n behind how people are gonna trade that amongst each other.\n\n40:14.360 --> 40:16.620\n So that would be like a smart contract layer\n\n40:16.620 --> 40:17.980\n and issue an asset.\n\n40:17.980 --> 40:20.340\n So you have this centralized server running\n\n40:20.340 --> 40:23.900\n and proprietary software controlled by a single company,\n\n40:23.900 --> 40:26.500\n but then you've opened your application up\n\n40:26.500 --> 40:27.940\n to a broader world.\n\n40:27.940 --> 40:29.940\n And what we've done now is added a blockchain layer\n\n40:29.940 --> 40:32.140\n and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset\n\n40:32.140 --> 40:34.500\n and the spending policy of that stuff.\n\n40:34.500 --> 40:37.500\n So that is a much smaller program\n\n40:37.500 --> 40:40.820\n than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft.\n\n40:40.820 --> 40:43.400\n So the point of Plutus was let's create a language\n\n40:43.400 --> 40:46.740\n where you can write these small to midsize programs\n\n40:46.740 --> 40:48.280\n and have a high degree of confidence\n\n40:48.280 --> 40:50.240\n that they behave with correctness\n\n40:50.240 --> 40:52.900\n and also they give you deterministic results\n\n40:52.900 --> 40:54.200\n on the consumption of resources.\n\n40:54.200 --> 40:55.980\n You can run things locally\n\n40:55.980 --> 40:57.920\n and you actually understand what it costs to run\n\n40:57.920 --> 41:01.220\n and that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system.\n\n41:01.220 --> 41:03.740\n If you dial up the expressiveness of the system\n\n41:03.740 --> 41:05.140\n and like Ethereum does\n\n41:05.140 --> 41:07.720\n and these big mutable account systems,\n\n41:07.720 --> 41:09.360\n the problem is you have to have global state.\n\n41:09.360 --> 41:11.040\n So whatever you test locally\n\n41:11.040 --> 41:13.320\n doesn't actually necessarily translate\n\n41:13.320 --> 41:15.300\n to what you've deployed, okay?\n\n41:15.300 --> 41:17.860\n So we spent a long time asking\n\n41:17.860 --> 41:19.580\n like where's the Goldilocks zone?\n\n41:19.580 --> 41:22.140\n Bitcoin script was too restrictive\n\n41:22.140 --> 41:24.620\n and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up,\n\n41:24.620 --> 41:26.220\n it led to mega problems.\n\n41:26.220 --> 41:27.220\n Like there was a beautiful thing\n\n41:27.220 --> 41:29.860\n called the value overflow incident in 2010,\n\n41:29.860 --> 41:32.500\n which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin.\n\n41:32.500 --> 41:33.740\n They had to quickly clean that up\n\n41:33.740 --> 41:34.700\n and sweep it under the rug\n\n41:34.700 --> 41:36.420\n and pretend like it didn't exist.\n\n41:36.420 --> 41:38.740\n But that was mostly because of an issue\n\n41:38.740 --> 41:41.340\n with how the scripting language was implemented.\n\n41:41.340 --> 41:44.100\n And when you look at Ethereum,\n\n41:44.100 --> 41:45.820\n it's like this pure game\n\n41:45.820 --> 41:48.060\n of stomping down these skirmishers\n\n41:48.060 --> 41:49.340\n where every update there's something\n\n41:49.340 --> 41:50.720\n they have to change or tune\n\n41:50.720 --> 41:54.140\n and then it's not clear how you shard such a model.\n\n41:54.140 --> 41:55.660\n So we said, let's build something\n\n41:55.660 --> 41:56.940\n that's in the middle of this\n\n41:56.940 --> 41:58.660\n and that's what Plutus basically is.\n\n41:58.660 --> 42:01.100\n And it's really designed to play very nicely\n\n42:01.100 --> 42:02.480\n with off chain infrastructure\n\n42:02.480 --> 42:04.340\n as much as on chain infrastructure.\n\n42:04.340 --> 42:06.020\n So you can look at all those different examples,\n\n42:06.020 --> 42:07.960\n whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off\n\n42:07.960 --> 42:10.300\n their universes or Blizzard wants\n\n42:10.300 --> 42:12.260\n to issue an in game currency\n\n42:12.260 --> 42:14.460\n or your Uber and you wanna start putting\n\n42:14.460 --> 42:17.180\n peer to peer dynamics inside your system,\n\n42:17.180 --> 42:20.740\n you're gonna gracefully connect to that on chain code.\n\n42:20.740 --> 42:23.180\n And it's very clear how those two things connect together.\n\n42:23.180 --> 42:25.700\n Just so happens Haskell's really good for this.\n\n42:25.700 --> 42:26.840\n They have template Haskell\n\n42:26.840 --> 42:27.780\n and it makes it very easy\n\n42:27.780 --> 42:30.060\n to embed domain specific languages.\n\n42:30.060 --> 42:32.400\n And it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code\n\n42:32.400 --> 42:34.240\n onto off chain infrastructure.\n\n42:34.240 --> 42:35.820\n So in the future,\n\n42:35.820 --> 42:37.820\n you'll be able to have your off chain run a node\n\n42:37.820 --> 42:40.740\n or the Java virtual machine or a.NET application\n\n42:40.740 --> 42:42.580\n and there'll just be this beautiful interface\n\n42:42.580 --> 42:44.260\n and then it can talk to all your on chain code\n\n42:44.260 --> 42:45.940\n and that's written in that DSL\n\n42:45.940 --> 42:49.300\n and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right.\n\n42:49.300 --> 42:52.220\n Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus\n\n42:52.220 --> 42:55.060\n that reveals the beauty of this balance\n\n42:55.060 --> 42:56.180\n that you're referring to?\n\n42:56.180 --> 42:59.960\n Sort of simple but not too simple, the Einstein idea?\n\n42:59.960 --> 43:02.980\n Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program\n\n43:02.980 --> 43:03.820\n actually today.\n\n43:03.820 --> 43:04.900\n Yeah, I heard about this.\n\n43:04.900 --> 43:06.540\n Yeah, but you know,\n\n43:06.540 --> 43:08.580\n there you'd want to have the whole round trip.\n\n43:08.580 --> 43:10.300\n So you'd like to have an interaction\n\n43:10.300 --> 43:12.460\n and I think a video game would probably show it the best.\n\n43:12.460 --> 43:14.340\n Like if we could re implement CryptoKitties\n\n43:14.340 --> 43:15.800\n or something like that on it\n\n43:15.800 --> 43:17.380\n and you have this off chain infrastructure\n\n43:17.380 --> 43:18.820\n and you have your GUI in your front end,\n\n43:18.820 --> 43:21.100\n it's running on your phone or a browser\n\n43:21.100 --> 43:22.860\n and most of that lives off chain.\n\n43:22.860 --> 43:24.260\n And then, but your CryptoKitties,\n\n43:24.260 --> 43:26.180\n they'd live on the blockchain.\n\n43:26.180 --> 43:27.920\n The whole round trip end to end\n\n43:27.920 --> 43:30.100\n with relatively low fees and low latency\n\n43:30.100 --> 43:34.220\n and high availability of service, it never goes down.\n\n43:34.220 --> 43:35.980\n That would probably be the best thing to do\n\n43:35.980 --> 43:37.820\n and we'll have something like that by August.\n\n43:37.820 --> 43:39.180\n It's pretty easy to build this stuff.\n\n43:39.180 --> 43:40.780\n So what kind of off chain interactions\n\n43:40.780 --> 43:41.940\n are supported with Plutus?\n\n43:41.940 --> 43:43.980\n What are the limits you want to put on the thing\n\n43:43.980 --> 43:45.100\n so it doesn't get chaotic?\n\n43:45.100 --> 43:46.000\n That's the beautiful thing.\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:48.180\n When you have a less expressive model on chain,\n\n43:48.180 --> 43:50.740\n it means you can do anything you want off chain.\n\n43:50.740 --> 43:52.580\n So you started talking about smart contracts,\n\n43:52.580 --> 43:55.940\n but let's zoom back out\n\n43:55.940 --> 43:59.860\n and ask the big question here is what is a blockchain\n\n43:59.860 --> 44:02.180\n and what is a cryptocurrency?\n\n44:02.180 --> 44:04.180\n So a blockchain is just a ledger\n\n44:04.180 --> 44:05.900\n and really it has three nice properties.\n\n44:05.900 --> 44:08.260\n You're timestamped, you're immutable and auditable,\n\n44:08.260 --> 44:10.240\n either in a global or a local sense.\n\n44:10.240 --> 44:13.460\n And so there's all kinds of things mankind has invented\n\n44:13.460 --> 44:15.080\n where it's really important\n\n44:15.080 --> 44:17.700\n that when you put some information down,\n\n44:17.700 --> 44:21.220\n it doesn't change and other people can see it\n\n44:21.220 --> 44:23.260\n and that you know when it was put down.\n\n44:23.260 --> 44:24.660\n For example, a property ledger.\n\n44:24.660 --> 44:28.020\n So when you buy land or you have rights associated with land\n\n44:28.020 --> 44:31.040\n like mineral rights or water rights or these things,\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:33.700\n you'd like to transitively see how does it go\n\n44:33.700 --> 44:35.700\n from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim\n\n44:35.700 --> 44:38.540\n and so forth and what was the state of these things\n\n44:38.540 --> 44:39.620\n as they were transitioning?\n\n44:39.620 --> 44:43.260\n So how much did they pay, when did it occur,\n\n44:43.260 --> 44:46.140\n et cetera, et cetera, the metadata that follows that.\n\n44:46.140 --> 44:48.540\n Okay, well normally these types of ledgers\n\n44:48.540 --> 44:51.020\n are so important that they're managed either by governments\n\n44:51.020 --> 44:52.420\n or regulated entities.\n\n44:52.420 --> 44:55.820\n And the issues are that while they can be efficient,\n\n44:55.820 --> 44:58.940\n they're generally brittle to political manipulation\n\n44:58.940 --> 45:02.060\n and they're brittle to geopolitical events.\n\n45:02.060 --> 45:04.500\n For example, when Syria fell apart,\n\n45:04.500 --> 45:06.580\n the very first thing ISIS did, they started saying,\n\n45:06.580 --> 45:08.640\n hey, the ownership of the land,\n\n45:08.640 --> 45:10.380\n it's gonna fundamentally change.\n\n45:10.380 --> 45:12.380\n We've decided that this guy over here\n\n45:12.380 --> 45:15.140\n now owns all these things and then when peace comes,\n\n45:15.140 --> 45:18.440\n how do you unwind all of that, put it all back together?\n\n45:18.440 --> 45:21.220\n So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you\n\n45:21.220 --> 45:25.100\n a transnational way of sorting all these details out,\n\n45:25.100 --> 45:29.620\n putting all together in a place that you know\n\n45:29.620 --> 45:33.320\n that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor,\n\n45:33.320 --> 45:35.660\n that it will still stay preserved.\n\n45:35.660 --> 45:38.780\n This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society.\n\n45:38.780 --> 45:40.860\n Usually kings and empires,\n\n45:40.860 --> 45:43.260\n they have the ability to decide what's true.\n\n45:43.260 --> 45:45.420\n And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing\n\n45:45.420 --> 45:49.020\n that is above them, kind of like a synthetic laws of physics\n\n45:49.020 --> 45:50.860\n and once something goes in there,\n\n45:50.860 --> 45:52.840\n you know that that's there.\n\n45:52.840 --> 45:54.780\n Okay, so that's the first part of it.\n\n45:54.780 --> 45:59.500\n The second part of it is that it's auditable,\n\n45:59.500 --> 46:02.700\n meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric\n\n46:02.700 --> 46:07.260\n or the president or some very special club of people\n\n46:07.260 --> 46:08.980\n get to see what's going on,\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:11.820\n suddenly now all the people can actually see\n\n46:11.820 --> 46:13.300\n who owns what where.\n\n46:13.300 --> 46:16.100\n Like imagine a tax system where the public club\n\n46:16.100 --> 46:19.140\n just leaked the taxes of all these different billionaires\n\n46:19.140 --> 46:20.100\n and said, well, how much do they make\n\n46:20.100 --> 46:21.340\n and how much do they pay?\n\n46:21.340 --> 46:24.700\n Well, imagine a tax system where that's just done by default\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:27.800\n or other social systems where this type of information\n\n46:27.800 --> 46:29.220\n is put in by default.\n\n46:29.220 --> 46:32.840\n So it's tremendously useful, this type of structure\n\n46:32.840 --> 46:35.780\n and all kinds of things, medical records, supply chains,\n\n46:35.780 --> 46:38.500\n just a good thought experiment is I travel a lot,\n\n46:38.500 --> 46:41.060\n I've been to 52 countries in the last five years.\n\n46:41.060 --> 46:43.660\n Imagine if I got sick in Zimbabwe,\n\n46:43.660 --> 46:46.140\n I get hit by a car or something and I'm unconscious\n\n46:46.140 --> 46:48.820\n and a Zimbabwean doctor calls my doctor in Colorado\n\n46:48.820 --> 46:51.700\n and says, hey, I need all Charles's medical records.\n\n46:51.700 --> 46:54.740\n He's unconscious right now, but I need it to treat him\n\n46:54.740 --> 46:56.220\n because he's quite ill.\n\n46:56.220 --> 46:58.860\n They'd say, who is this person in Zimbabwe?\n\n46:58.860 --> 47:00.820\n I don't know you, I can't give you his records,\n\n47:00.820 --> 47:01.660\n I need his consent.\n\n47:01.660 --> 47:04.180\n Oh no, he's unconscious in the hospital, I can't do it.\n\n47:04.180 --> 47:06.260\n Well, a broker system that would allow the movement\n\n47:06.260 --> 47:07.800\n of medical records would be an example\n\n47:07.800 --> 47:09.420\n of what a blockchain could potentially do\n\n47:09.420 --> 47:10.820\n in the foreseeable future.\n\n47:10.820 --> 47:12.700\n Cryptocurrency is just an application\n\n47:12.700 --> 47:14.220\n that runs on top of blockchain\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:16.460\n because it turns out that when you issue property,\n\n47:16.460 --> 47:18.860\n you also can issue tokens of value\n\n47:18.860 --> 47:20.420\n and then you could have a monetary policy,\n\n47:20.420 --> 47:22.660\n it could be inflationary or deflationary,\n\n47:22.660 --> 47:25.080\n you know, demurrage where it decays over time\n\n47:25.080 --> 47:27.300\n or whatever have you.\n\n47:27.300 --> 47:29.940\n And the very same mechanics that would ensure\n\n47:29.940 --> 47:31.500\n your property records are secure,\n\n47:31.500 --> 47:33.420\n your medical record access is secure,\n\n47:33.420 --> 47:35.140\n could also be applied for the ownership\n\n47:35.140 --> 47:36.180\n of the cryptocurrency.\n\n47:36.180 --> 47:38.780\n And again, you can either be completely transparent\n\n47:38.780 --> 47:40.240\n and everybody can see what everybody owns\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:41.640\n and that's what Bitcoin does,\n\n47:41.640 --> 47:44.220\n or you can be as opaque as you seek to be,\n\n47:44.220 --> 47:46.420\n that's what Zcash basically attempts to do.\n\n47:46.420 --> 47:47.740\n It says, hey, let's keep these things\n\n47:47.740 --> 47:49.100\n as private as possible.\n\n47:49.100 --> 47:50.740\n But they have relatively the same mechanics\n\n47:50.740 --> 47:52.660\n in terms of those properties of auditability\n\n47:52.660 --> 47:54.700\n and timestamping and immutability.\n\n47:54.700 --> 47:56.380\n You know things won't be reversed,\n\n47:56.380 --> 47:57.900\n you know, that people aren't gonna manipulate\n\n47:57.900 --> 48:01.160\n the timestamps and you can audit at least enough\n\n48:01.160 --> 48:03.220\n to know that the ownership is right.\n\n48:03.220 --> 48:06.500\n But the way, if you think about physics and the universe,\n\n48:06.500 --> 48:07.900\n the universe has figured out a way\n\n48:07.900 --> 48:10.580\n to update the ledger of physics\n\n48:10.580 --> 48:13.380\n in a way where like a lot of people can be updating it\n\n48:13.380 --> 48:16.100\n and it stays consistent.\n\n48:16.100 --> 48:19.660\n Is there something you can say about the task\n\n48:19.660 --> 48:21.940\n of updating the ledger when a bunch of people\n\n48:21.940 --> 48:23.820\n are trying to do it or a bunch of entities\n\n48:23.820 --> 48:24.660\n are trying to do it?\n\n48:24.660 --> 48:26.260\n Oh yeah, that's the whole point of a consensus algorithm.\n\n48:26.260 --> 48:28.260\n So whatever ledger you're running,\n\n48:28.260 --> 48:32.080\n there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge.\n\n48:32.080 --> 48:33.720\n And that's what proof of work does\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:35.860\n and proof of stake does and all these other systems.\n\n48:35.860 --> 48:37.900\n And you break them down to basically three steps.\n\n48:37.900 --> 48:40.620\n And so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one.\n\n48:40.620 --> 48:42.100\n Hi, Eve, how are you doing?\n\n48:42.100 --> 48:44.380\n And we're gonna use Wally for step number two.\n\n48:44.380 --> 48:47.180\n And I need the monkey, give me the monkey.\n\n48:47.180 --> 48:49.040\n What's the monkey's name?\n\n48:49.040 --> 48:49.880\n Daisy.\n\n48:49.880 --> 48:50.980\n Daisy the monkey, okay.\n\n48:50.980 --> 48:52.340\n I like Daisy.\n\n48:52.340 --> 48:54.980\n Daisy is a very confused monkey.\n\n48:54.980 --> 48:56.740\n It's pondering its own mortality.\n\n48:56.740 --> 48:57.580\n Right.\n\n48:57.580 --> 49:00.220\n And so anyway, the first step is all about\n\n49:00.220 --> 49:03.180\n basically deciding who's in charge for that moment.\n\n49:03.180 --> 49:05.100\n So blockchain is just a sequence of events.\n\n49:05.100 --> 49:08.100\n The heart has to beat, the metronome has to click.\n\n49:08.100 --> 49:09.900\n So somebody has to be in charge.\n\n49:09.900 --> 49:12.000\n And so generally you have this notion of a resource.\n\n49:12.000 --> 49:14.220\n So there's some pool of resource out there\n\n49:14.220 --> 49:15.420\n and it can be a token.\n\n49:15.420 --> 49:17.260\n And in that case, it's a plutocratic system\n\n49:17.260 --> 49:18.780\n and that's what proof of stake does\n\n49:18.780 --> 49:21.720\n or it can be computation, but there can be other resources.\n\n49:21.720 --> 49:23.340\n But computation is what proof of work does.\n\n49:23.340 --> 49:25.060\n And so you make so many hashes\n\n49:25.060 --> 49:27.060\n and then eventually somebody wins.\n\n49:27.060 --> 49:29.360\n And that person who wins is now the person\n\n49:29.360 --> 49:32.060\n who basically gets to decide the order of transactions\n\n49:32.060 --> 49:33.260\n and put them all together\n\n49:33.260 --> 49:35.500\n from their perspective in the system.\n\n49:35.500 --> 49:37.940\n Then once that person wins, they'll make the block.\n\n49:37.940 --> 49:38.980\n That's step two.\n\n49:38.980 --> 49:41.240\n And after it's made, transmit it\n\n49:41.240 --> 49:43.100\n and it gets validated and accepted.\n\n49:43.100 --> 49:44.160\n So actually it's quite fortuitous\n\n49:44.160 --> 49:45.540\n you have the magnifying glass\n\n49:45.540 --> 49:48.740\n because at this stage people are trying to decide\n\n49:48.740 --> 49:51.120\n is what I'm looking at correct or not.\n\n49:51.120 --> 49:54.400\n Now, there are other ways to potentially conceive of this,\n\n49:54.400 --> 49:57.540\n but this particular model gives you a kind of a way\n\n49:57.540 --> 50:02.540\n of thinking of all consensus algorithms in one setting.\n\n50:02.620 --> 50:06.100\n You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol,\n\n50:06.100 --> 50:08.060\n you can be Paxos, you can be Raft,\n\n50:08.060 --> 50:10.320\n you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake.\n\n50:10.320 --> 50:12.340\n It's always the same idea.\n\n50:12.340 --> 50:15.980\n You have to find someone or some group to be in charge.\n\n50:15.980 --> 50:18.520\n They'll reach a consensus on order.\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:21.140\n They have to then do some work,\n\n50:21.140 --> 50:23.460\n change the state of the system, update it,\n\n50:23.460 --> 50:26.400\n and then the network has to accept that that's valid.\n\n50:26.400 --> 50:28.540\n So even if this process works well,\n\n50:28.540 --> 50:29.380\n this side will say,\n\n50:29.380 --> 50:31.020\n oh, you created a Bitcoin at a thin air,\n\n50:31.020 --> 50:32.020\n you're not allowed to do that.\n\n50:32.020 --> 50:33.580\n So that's rejected.\n\n50:33.580 --> 50:36.600\n So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through.\n\n50:36.600 --> 50:39.740\n There's a meta question of fairness in all of this.\n\n50:39.740 --> 50:42.060\n So the proof of work people, they're kind of a cult\n\n50:42.060 --> 50:44.980\n and they say that this is the only truth\n\n50:44.980 --> 50:46.560\n and everything out here,\n\n50:46.560 --> 50:49.420\n any other resource is not legitimate or valid.\n\n50:49.420 --> 50:51.460\n And there's not a lot of evidence to that,\n\n50:51.460 --> 50:52.740\n but that's what they believe.\n\n50:52.740 --> 50:53.820\n The proof of stake people,\n\n50:53.820 --> 50:55.300\n the downside and weakness they have\n\n50:55.300 --> 50:57.100\n is it's a plutocratic model.\n\n50:57.100 --> 50:59.020\n The more ownership of the system you have,\n\n50:59.020 --> 51:01.240\n the more control you have over that system.\n\n51:01.240 --> 51:03.280\n And it suffers from the same thing\n\n51:03.280 --> 51:04.780\n that shareholder models suffer from,\n\n51:04.780 --> 51:07.620\n whereas you may maximize short term gain\n\n51:07.620 --> 51:09.860\n over the long term viability of the system.\n\n51:09.860 --> 51:11.340\n So a really cool question is,\n\n51:11.340 --> 51:14.020\n can you build systems that are multi resource?\n\n51:14.020 --> 51:16.660\n So instead of just pulling from one resource\n\n51:16.660 --> 51:18.520\n to select who wins,\n\n51:18.520 --> 51:22.220\n this 25% of the time and maybe this 25%, you can do that.\n\n51:22.220 --> 51:25.220\n In fact, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago.\n\n51:25.220 --> 51:27.900\n There was a cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011,\n\n51:27.900 --> 51:30.380\n and it was a hybrid proof of work proof of stake.\n\n51:30.380 --> 51:31.780\n So some of the blocks were made\n\n51:31.780 --> 51:34.700\n with the token ownership distribution\n\n51:34.700 --> 51:36.660\n and some of the blocks were made with proof of work,\n\n51:36.660 --> 51:38.300\n but you could keep adding.\n\n51:38.300 --> 51:41.260\n You could put in like, hey, I want hard disk in my thing.\n\n51:41.260 --> 51:43.380\n You can put Permacoin in or something like that.\n\n51:43.380 --> 51:45.020\n So it created incentive for hard drives.\n\n51:45.020 --> 51:45.860\n And then you could say, oh no,\n\n51:45.860 --> 51:48.820\n I want to do like a human system, like a proof of merit.\n\n51:48.820 --> 51:50.140\n Oh my God, now we're up to four.\n\n51:50.140 --> 51:51.380\n And you just keep adding.\n\n51:51.380 --> 51:54.140\n And each of these pools will have different adherence\n\n51:54.140 --> 51:56.540\n and actors, and then you can actually balance out\n\n51:56.540 --> 51:57.380\n the whole thing.\n\n51:57.380 --> 51:59.940\n So as opposed to having one cult, you have many cults.\n\n51:59.940 --> 52:01.140\n Exactly. And they argue.\n\n52:01.140 --> 52:02.420\n And the cults argue with each other\n\n52:02.420 --> 52:03.460\n and we call that a government.\n\n52:03.460 --> 52:05.220\n By the way, not all cults are bad.\n\n52:05.220 --> 52:06.780\n Physics is a cult too.\n\n52:06.780 --> 52:08.280\n And it's sometimes bad.\n\n52:09.360 --> 52:10.940\n It's honest at least.\n\n52:10.940 --> 52:12.080\n Nature is a cult.\n\n52:12.080 --> 52:15.640\n Nature is metal, I saw it on Instagram.\n\n52:15.640 --> 52:17.600\n So that's really the crux of it.\n\n52:17.600 --> 52:20.480\n You have a ledger and the ledger is just all about saying,\n\n52:20.480 --> 52:21.960\n hey, we need to put some stuff in here.\n\n52:21.960 --> 52:24.520\n And once it's put in here, you can't turn it back.\n\n52:24.520 --> 52:27.880\n And you know when it was put in and everybody can see it\n\n52:27.880 --> 52:29.240\n or some group can see it.\n\n52:29.240 --> 52:31.640\n And then you need to pick somebody to modify that.\n\n52:31.640 --> 52:33.120\n So all this chaos will happen.\n\n52:33.120 --> 52:35.160\n All these transactions are all around the world\n\n52:35.160 --> 52:37.280\n and our perception of them are different.\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:38.900\n There's a beautiful paper from Lamport\n\n52:38.900 --> 52:40.760\n that kind of talks about this from the 70s.\n\n52:40.760 --> 52:43.320\n It's like one of the most classic papers ever\n\n52:43.320 --> 52:44.220\n in computer science.\n\n52:44.220 --> 52:46.960\n I think it's been cited like 50,000 times\n\n52:46.960 --> 52:47.800\n or something like that.\n\n52:47.800 --> 52:48.840\n It's a crazy paper.\n\n52:48.840 --> 52:50.400\n But basically you have to figure out,\n\n52:50.400 --> 52:51.920\n okay, well, somebody has to be in charge.\n\n52:51.920 --> 52:53.580\n Some group has to be in charge.\n\n52:53.580 --> 52:55.640\n And you can do it with a meritocratic,\n\n52:55.640 --> 52:58.000\n hashocratic computation thing.\n\n52:58.000 --> 53:00.920\n You can say, well, if you have coins 25% of supply,\n\n53:00.920 --> 53:03.060\n 25% of the time on average,\n\n53:03.060 --> 53:04.840\n you'll be selected to have the right to do this\n\n53:04.840 --> 53:06.200\n or give it to somebody else.\n\n53:06.200 --> 53:07.880\n Or you could search for other resources.\n\n53:07.880 --> 53:09.160\n And they can even be human resources,\n\n53:09.160 --> 53:12.060\n like some notion of merit or social benefit.\n\n53:12.060 --> 53:13.400\n Maybe you get a token for that\n\n53:13.400 --> 53:15.760\n and you can weight it with these other systems.\n\n53:15.760 --> 53:18.000\n And that's where kind of where everything's going.\n\n53:18.000 --> 53:21.080\n We're getting to a point where we've really optimized\n\n53:21.080 --> 53:22.120\n all the properties here.\n\n53:22.120 --> 53:24.080\n We've proven all these nice things about it.\n\n53:24.080 --> 53:25.740\n And there's a lot of competition\n\n53:25.740 --> 53:28.800\n to basically build like the perfect proof of stake system,\n\n53:28.800 --> 53:30.920\n whether you're Polkadot or Algorand\n\n53:30.920 --> 53:32.820\n or any of these other guys.\n\n53:32.820 --> 53:34.640\n But now the next step is say, well,\n\n53:34.640 --> 53:36.860\n why don't we just have one?\n\n53:36.860 --> 53:38.960\n We should have multiple resources.\n\n53:38.960 --> 53:40.480\n And the point is each of these\n\n53:40.480 --> 53:42.240\n has different trade off profiles.\n\n53:42.240 --> 53:43.680\n And so they balance each other\n\n53:43.680 --> 53:45.660\n and you end up building a much more resilient system.\n\n53:45.660 --> 53:49.260\n So it's not winner take all with one particular demand.\n\n53:49.260 --> 53:50.960\n Okay, so there's a million questions\n\n53:50.960 --> 53:52.440\n that spring up right there.\n\n53:52.440 --> 53:54.440\n But first linger on this topic and say,\n\n53:54.440 --> 53:55.520\n what is proof of work?\n\n53:55.520 --> 53:56.820\n What is proof of stake?\n\n53:56.820 --> 53:59.480\n Just zooming in on each of those.\n\n53:59.480 --> 54:01.500\n And what are the differences?\n\n54:01.500 --> 54:03.920\n Okay, so they all have the same three properties\n\n54:03.920 --> 54:06.640\n of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it.\n\n54:06.640 --> 54:09.280\n The difference is that the picking mechanism for proof\n\n54:09.280 --> 54:11.400\n of work is you have to solve a puzzle.\n\n54:11.400 --> 54:13.600\n So it's basically like buying lottery tickets\n\n54:13.600 --> 54:16.480\n and you can buy a certain amount every second\n\n54:16.480 --> 54:18.040\n with your computing devices.\n\n54:18.040 --> 54:19.640\n And some of them are ASIC resistant.\n\n54:19.640 --> 54:22.000\n So you run them on like a laptop or a GPU.\n\n54:22.000 --> 54:24.400\n And some of them are you specialized hardware\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:26.320\n that you have to either manufacturer\n\n54:26.320 --> 54:28.600\n or buy from someone who sells it to you.\n\n54:28.600 --> 54:31.120\n And that's just how many tickets per second you can get.\n\n54:31.120 --> 54:32.960\n And eventually you hit those magic numbers.\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:36.360\n When you do, it means you have the right to make the block\n\n54:36.360 --> 54:38.320\n and generally you bundle the block making\n\n54:38.320 --> 54:39.980\n with the proof of work system.\n\n54:39.980 --> 54:43.020\n Now you can do this looking for a single\n\n54:43.020 --> 54:44.640\n or you can do this to actually shard it\n\n54:44.640 --> 54:47.560\n and look for multiple block makers at the same time.\n\n54:47.560 --> 54:49.200\n So there are sharded proof of work protocols\n\n54:49.200 --> 54:50.840\n like Prism is an example of that.\n\n54:50.840 --> 54:53.800\n And actually Ethereum got started this way\n\n54:53.800 --> 54:56.360\n with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom,\n\n54:56.360 --> 54:59.700\n the Aviz Ahar's work and Yonatan Sonlopinsky.\n\n54:59.700 --> 55:02.400\n But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people,\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:03.540\n they make some collection of things\n\n55:03.540 --> 55:04.920\n and there's some way to sort it all out,\n\n55:04.920 --> 55:07.720\n serialize it and prevent double spends, great.\n\n55:07.720 --> 55:11.200\n Proof of stake is the same, but it's a synthetic resource.\n\n55:11.200 --> 55:13.160\n So instead of doing things, they say,\n\n55:13.160 --> 55:15.840\n well, if you had 25% of the hash power on average\n\n55:15.840 --> 55:17.180\n over a long period of time,\n\n55:17.180 --> 55:19.560\n you'd probably win 25% of the time.\n\n55:19.560 --> 55:21.800\n Well, why don't we just introduce some randomness in\n\n55:21.800 --> 55:24.960\n from some source and then 25% of the time on average\n\n55:24.960 --> 55:26.920\n over a long period of time, you'll win.\n\n55:26.920 --> 55:28.820\n So it's a synthetic resource,\n\n55:28.820 --> 55:30.560\n but you still have to do the other two things.\n\n55:30.560 --> 55:31.880\n You still have to make the block\n\n55:31.880 --> 55:33.900\n and you still have to validate the block.\n\n55:33.900 --> 55:36.940\n The big difference is this step in the proof of work world\n\n55:36.940 --> 55:38.800\n is horrendously expensive.\n\n55:38.800 --> 55:41.540\n You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland.\n\n55:41.540 --> 55:43.860\n And the problem with that is that you have less resources\n\n55:43.860 --> 55:45.020\n for the other two.\n\n55:45.020 --> 55:46.440\n And the other problem with that is that\n\n55:46.440 --> 55:48.280\n if this is horrendously expensive,\n\n55:48.280 --> 55:50.500\n you have an economy of scale kick in.\n\n55:50.500 --> 55:52.500\n So what ends up happening is the system becomes\n\n55:52.500 --> 55:54.420\n less decentralized over time\n\n55:54.420 --> 55:56.860\n because you have these vertically integrated operations.\n\n55:56.860 --> 55:59.020\n I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility\n\n55:59.020 --> 56:00.840\n on a volcano in El Salvador.\n\n56:00.840 --> 56:02.880\n Not everybody can go to Mongolia\n\n56:02.880 --> 56:05.120\n and set up a five gigawatt power plant\n\n56:05.120 --> 56:06.320\n and a huge data thing.\n\n56:06.320 --> 56:08.980\n Not everybody has access to the patented basics\n\n56:08.980 --> 56:10.120\n that people produce.\n\n56:10.120 --> 56:11.340\n Because what if I don't sell it to you\n\n56:11.340 --> 56:12.640\n and I have the patent on it?\n\n56:12.640 --> 56:15.280\n Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?\n\n56:15.280 --> 56:18.720\n So you'll end up having centralization around maybe 10\n\n56:18.720 --> 56:22.300\n or five major operations as we've seen historically\n\n56:22.300 --> 56:23.320\n with proof of work.\n\n56:23.320 --> 56:27.120\n And that means you end up having like a ruling class\n\n56:27.120 --> 56:29.420\n of a mining oligarchy in the system.\n\n56:29.420 --> 56:32.320\n Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly,\n\n56:32.320 --> 56:34.960\n you actually get more decentralized over time\n\n56:34.960 --> 56:37.220\n because as the currency goes up in value,\n\n56:37.220 --> 56:38.880\n the distribution of the currency\n\n56:38.880 --> 56:43.120\n tends to get more egalitarian.\n\n56:43.120 --> 56:45.640\n For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft,\n\n56:45.640 --> 56:47.500\n he had 64% of the shares.\n\n56:47.500 --> 56:49.880\n Now he has less than 5% of the shares.\n\n56:49.880 --> 56:52.040\n So this founder drift over time,\n\n56:52.040 --> 56:54.120\n as the value goes up, divestment occurs,\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:56.600\n you have more and more and more people coming in.\n\n56:56.600 --> 56:57.520\n That means there's more people\n\n56:57.520 --> 56:59.320\n who can participate in the consensus.\n\n56:59.320 --> 57:01.160\n You can even tune economic parameters.\n\n57:01.160 --> 57:03.960\n And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros.\n\n57:03.960 --> 57:06.680\n We created this concept of K in the system\n\n57:06.680 --> 57:07.600\n and it's just a parameter.\n\n57:07.600 --> 57:09.640\n And it's like a forcing factor\n\n57:09.640 --> 57:12.280\n that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pools.\n\n57:12.280 --> 57:16.160\n So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1000 and so forth.\n\n57:16.160 --> 57:19.280\n But the basic idea is as the price of ADA goes up,\n\n57:19.280 --> 57:23.080\n you make K larger and then you end up in practical terms\n\n57:23.080 --> 57:27.080\n having a larger and larger set of actors making blocks\n\n57:27.080 --> 57:28.600\n that are unique and distinct.\n\n57:28.600 --> 57:31.440\n And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource\n\n57:31.440 --> 57:32.960\n instead of a physical resource,\n\n57:32.960 --> 57:35.840\n which means it's portable by the click of a button.\n\n57:35.840 --> 57:37.880\n So let's say China says, mining is bad,\n\n57:37.880 --> 57:39.000\n we're gonna shut it all down.\n\n57:39.000 --> 57:40.960\n And it looks like they're moving in that direction.\n\n57:40.960 --> 57:42.160\n You have all these people in WeChat,\n\n57:42.160 --> 57:44.080\n just like trying to sell miners\n\n57:44.080 --> 57:46.640\n or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners,\n\n57:46.640 --> 57:48.200\n because they have these huge data centers\n\n57:48.200 --> 57:49.040\n they've constructed.\n\n57:49.040 --> 57:50.760\n You can't exactly go and grab a server\n\n57:50.760 --> 57:52.440\n and like take it with you, it's huge.\n\n57:52.440 --> 57:53.280\n It's a lot of work.\n\n57:53.280 --> 57:54.340\n And if the government sees it,\n\n57:54.340 --> 57:56.000\n well, it's their property now.\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:57.900\n A virtual resource, you can click a button\n\n57:57.900 --> 58:00.760\n and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction.\n\n58:00.760 --> 58:03.480\n So to me, for a virtual asset,\n\n58:03.480 --> 58:06.080\n it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security\n\n58:06.080 --> 58:08.960\n to something endogenous, something within the system,\n\n58:08.960 --> 58:11.000\n because it's just like the asset,\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:13.160\n it can move anywhere at a click of a button\n\n58:13.160 --> 58:15.120\n and human beings have a much harder time\n\n58:15.120 --> 58:16.480\n attacking something like that.\n\n58:16.480 --> 58:19.520\n Well, so people, maybe you could sort of play devil's advocate\n\n58:19.520 --> 58:21.560\n and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?\n\n58:21.560 --> 58:25.380\n Because some people would argue that proof of work has,\n\n58:25.380 --> 58:28.000\n because it's outside the system,\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:31.240\n it's tied to physical resources, it's more secure.\n\n58:31.240 --> 58:36.240\n It's less prone to attack by large groups of people.\n\n58:36.540 --> 58:37.840\n Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n58:37.840 --> 58:39.900\n And the first question we had was,\n\n58:39.900 --> 58:41.780\n could proof of stake actually work or not?\n\n58:41.780 --> 58:44.740\n So the problem was that the engineers kind of led\n\n58:44.740 --> 58:46.080\n when the science should have led.\n\n58:46.080 --> 58:48.180\n And so there were all these POS protocols\n\n58:48.180 --> 58:50.440\n that came out in the early 2010s,\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:54.280\n like Peercoin was the first and then NXT and others came out.\n\n58:54.280 --> 58:55.520\n And there they had suffered from things\n\n58:55.520 --> 58:57.560\n like the random number generation wasn't good.\n\n58:57.560 --> 58:59.800\n They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake\n\n58:59.800 --> 59:00.760\n and all these other things.\n\n59:00.760 --> 59:02.580\n And there's a lot of beautiful properties\n\n59:02.580 --> 59:04.420\n for proof of work from a theoretical sense.\n\n59:04.420 --> 59:07.560\n We even wrote a paper called GKL,\n\n59:07.560 --> 59:10.640\n named after the authors, Juan Gray, Niko Leonardis\n\n59:10.640 --> 59:13.080\n and Agelos Gassis, our chief scientist.\n\n59:13.080 --> 59:17.320\n It's got 1100 citations now and it was published in 2015.\n\n59:17.320 --> 59:19.440\n But basically all it did is just model the blockchain\n\n59:19.440 --> 59:21.200\n and created some security properties for it.\n\n59:21.200 --> 59:22.480\n And then it started talking about,\n\n59:22.480 --> 59:24.600\n well, what does proof of work actually do for you?\n\n59:24.600 --> 59:26.240\n And it turns out it does a lot.\n\n59:26.240 --> 59:28.040\n It's an asynchronous system.\n\n59:28.040 --> 59:29.660\n You can bootstrap from Genesis.\n\n59:29.660 --> 59:34.040\n So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network\n\n59:34.040 --> 59:36.880\n and Daisy joined the network,\n\n59:36.880 --> 59:39.500\n then you give them some different chains,\n\n59:39.500 --> 59:41.280\n like five or 10 different chains.\n\n59:41.280 --> 59:42.960\n They can run a calculation\n\n59:42.960 --> 59:45.120\n and they will always pick the longest chain,\n\n59:45.120 --> 59:47.220\n the heaviest chain inside the system.\n\n59:47.220 --> 59:49.480\n That's a great property of proof of work.\n\n59:49.480 --> 59:52.880\n Until we published Ouroboros Genesis in 2018,\n\n59:52.880 --> 59:54.880\n you actually needed to solve that in proof of stake\n\n59:54.880 --> 59:56.600\n with a trusted checkpoint.\n\n59:56.600 --> 59:58.840\n So some actor had to be observing,\n\n59:58.840 --> 1:00:00.960\n watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints.\n\n1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:02.600\n And then when new people joined in,\n\n1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:05.080\n they would only be able to distinguish between a chain\n\n1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:07.800\n based upon a checkpoint telling them that.\n\n1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.200\n So you have to do a lot of really wonky, crazy math\n\n1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:12.920\n to show and create this notion of like density\n\n1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:14.780\n to be able to show that that's possible.\n\n1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:16.640\n But there's a lot of properties of proof of work\n\n1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.040\n that were super hard to replicate and emulate\n\n1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:20.960\n in the proof of stake world.\n\n1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:24.600\n Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing.\n\n1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.120\n There was a group out of Cornell\n\n1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:28.120\n that talked about better network conditions.\n\n1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:30.360\n They wrote a paper called Sleepy.\n\n1:00:30.360 --> 1:00:31.960\n We did Genesis.\n\n1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:34.760\n We also did the very first proofably secure protocol,\n\n1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:37.280\n but that was six years of work and like 12 papers.\n\n1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:38.140\n And it's still not done.\n\n1:00:38.140 --> 1:00:39.840\n There's still a few polishing things\n\n1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:41.720\n that have to be cleaned up\n\n1:00:41.720 --> 1:00:44.920\n because this is a physical resource\n\n1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:46.400\n and there's something there.\n\n1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:48.160\n But there's a flaw to proof of work\n\n1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:49.500\n that is a little problematic.\n\n1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:51.180\n It's a winner take all type of a system.\n\n1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:54.720\n So maximalism is kind of philosophically\n\n1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:56.640\n and computationally built into it.\n\n1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:59.960\n Let's say you have two proof of work systems\n\n1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.200\n and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate.\n\n1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:05.320\n And they use the same algorithm.\n\n1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:07.960\n Then the problem is if the miner comes in\n\n1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:09.800\n and let's say the miner has enough resources\n\n1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:13.520\n to have 51% for any of these chains,\n\n1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:15.080\n they actually have a perverse incentive\n\n1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:18.040\n to come and destroy one chain\n\n1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:21.200\n and short sell the asset, it's called a gold finger attack,\n\n1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:23.300\n and then go mine the other asset\n\n1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:25.360\n because they're not bound to that asset.\n\n1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:26.800\n They're not loyal to it.\n\n1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:29.660\n And they can make just as much profit mining this\n\n1:01:29.660 --> 1:01:31.840\n as they can make mining the other system\n\n1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:33.480\n and the markets allow them to profit\n\n1:01:33.480 --> 1:01:35.200\n from the destruction of a system.\n\n1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:37.800\n So that's something that proof of stake doesn't suffer from\n\n1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.720\n because the only way you can participate\n\n1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:40.720\n in a proof of stake system\n\n1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.160\n is you have to actually own equity\n\n1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:44.180\n and you have to have ownership in that system.\n\n1:01:44.180 --> 1:01:48.760\n So if you go and destroy Daisy's chain, it would just be\n\n1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:50.520\n a net loss for the most part,\n\n1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:51.880\n unless you have really messed up markets\n\n1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.140\n or something like that.\n\n1:01:53.140 --> 1:01:55.060\n So there's always trade offs and all these things.\n\n1:01:55.060 --> 1:01:57.180\n And this is why I like this concept of going one to end\n\n1:01:57.180 --> 1:01:58.940\n and having multiple resources,\n\n1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:00.620\n because why not have proof of work\n\n1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.160\n and proof of stake together?\n\n1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:05.400\n If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation,\n\n1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:06.600\n and why not add other things\n\n1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:08.760\n like create incentives for network relay?\n\n1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:10.440\n Right now there's no incentives in the system\n\n1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:12.400\n for you to run peer to peer nodes and the shared data.\n\n1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:13.560\n Right now it's not a problem,\n\n1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:16.180\n but if you're running like Amazon web services\n\n1:02:16.180 --> 1:02:17.040\n level of bandwidth,\n\n1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:19.720\n it could cost you like $5,000 a month in bandwidth\n\n1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:21.380\n just to run a full node or something like that.\n\n1:02:21.380 --> 1:02:22.480\n No one would do it.\n\n1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.120\n So then your system will centralize along the weakest link,\n\n1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:28.560\n whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer,\n\n1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:31.160\n or the network layer of the system.\n\n1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:33.480\n So if you can incentivize the resources differently,\n\n1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:35.040\n then you'll be in a beautiful position\n\n1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:37.680\n where you end up having a resilient system\n\n1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:39.480\n that pays its own bills.\n\n1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:43.400\n So how does Cardano solve the consensus problem?\n\n1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:46.800\n Do you tend to eventually wanting to solve it\n\n1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:50.360\n in the hybrid approach of proof of stake and proof of work?\n\n1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:52.240\n Yeah, this was a philosophical difference\n\n1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:54.440\n between Vitalik and myself.\n\n1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:56.440\n The problem with the people in the Ethereum side\n\n1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:57.520\n is they're really bright.\n\n1:02:57.520 --> 1:02:58.960\n And these really bright people,\n\n1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:01.920\n what they do is they try to do everything all at once\n\n1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:03.240\n because they're really, really smart\n\n1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:05.440\n and they keep going until they run up against the wall\n\n1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:07.920\n and they realize the problem is a lot harder.\n\n1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.360\n If you're more experienced,\n\n1:03:09.360 --> 1:03:11.460\n and that's why we brought in proper academics\n\n1:03:11.460 --> 1:03:13.680\n like Aggelos and others, because they've been beaten up\n\n1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:16.560\n through life, Aggelos worked with David Chom\n\n1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:19.680\n and these other, it's really hard work with those guys.\n\n1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:22.240\n And they'd already been humiliated and yelled at\n\n1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.040\n and had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff.\n\n1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:25.160\n And so they were humble enough to say,\n\n1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:27.200\n I'm not smart enough to solve the big problem.\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:28.280\n So don't even try.\n\n1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:30.600\n What you do is you decompose it and you say, okay,\n\n1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:33.680\n what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems\n\n1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:37.240\n that you can compose your way up to a working system?\n\n1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:39.240\n And once you get far enough along,\n\n1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:41.520\n you have something that's pretty good\n\n1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:43.720\n and then you have an obvious path forward\n\n1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:45.920\n of how do you iterate and improve that system?\n\n1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:47.760\n That's why we started with GKL 15,\n\n1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:48.600\n because it was just saying,\n\n1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:50.640\n we don't know what a fucking blockchain is.\n\n1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.440\n This is, what is this thing, right?\n\n1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:54.000\n What's the security properties of this stuff?\n\n1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.720\n Like, what did we really mean?\n\n1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:57.320\n Then we did Ouroboros Classic,\n\n1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:59.680\n the original Ouroboros protocol in 2017.\n\n1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.120\n And that protocol was like a synchronous system\n\n1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:05.160\n and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked,\n\n1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:08.060\n but it was useless because that's not real life.\n\n1:04:08.060 --> 1:04:10.600\n Then Prowse came out and then suddenly we relaxed things.\n\n1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:11.440\n So these are all, by the way,\n\n1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:12.600\n names for consensus algorithms.\n\n1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:14.560\n Yeah, papers that we published\n\n1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:15.800\n and they were all peer reviewed.\n\n1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:17.280\n Like GKL was EuroCrypt.\n\n1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:19.100\n That's a very hard conference to get into.\n\n1:04:19.100 --> 1:04:20.660\n And Ouroboros Classic was Crypto\n\n1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:24.600\n and Prowse was EuroCrypt and Genesis was CCS.\n\n1:04:24.600 --> 1:04:27.200\n So basically every step of the way\n\n1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:28.980\n was first an academic validation\n\n1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:31.280\n that there was some merit to the work that was done.\n\n1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:34.120\n Second, it solved a particular class of problems,\n\n1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.840\n either showing the feasibility of the entire problem.\n\n1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.720\n Because when I said, let's do the model first\n\n1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:40.400\n because let's see if we can do an FLP thing.\n\n1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:42.240\n Let's see if we can get them a possibility theorem.\n\n1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:43.720\n That's great because you're done.\n\n1:04:43.720 --> 1:04:45.600\n It's like those short math papers\n\n1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:47.300\n were like, I found a counterexample.\n\n1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:49.400\n It's like, oh, okay, this whole thing has fallen apart\n\n1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:51.880\n because you have a two line proof, thank you.\n\n1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:53.040\n So that's what we were looking for\n\n1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:54.700\n in the beginning of the agenda was,\n\n1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:57.840\n let's either prove it's possible in a straw man case\n\n1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.160\n or show that there exists an impossibility result,\n\n1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:02.320\n in which case we can just abandon the entire inquiry.\n\n1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:03.880\n Proof of stake is impossible.\n\n1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:06.160\n And then once you've gotten past that threshold,\n\n1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:08.520\n it goes from theory to practicality.\n\n1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:10.920\n What actual network conditions are you looking at?\n\n1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:13.420\n Are you okay with living with an external clock\n\n1:05:13.420 --> 1:05:15.360\n or do you wanna build time from within?\n\n1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:18.040\n How are you generating random numbers, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:19.960\n And every step of the way, each paper,\n\n1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:22.460\n you're solving one particular class of problems.\n\n1:05:22.460 --> 1:05:24.880\n With Prism, it said, probably shouldn't know\n\n1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:26.780\n ahead of time who Eve is.\n\n1:05:26.780 --> 1:05:28.880\n You probably shouldn't know who's making those blocks.\n\n1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:30.960\n That should be something after the fact.\n\n1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.840\n But if you know ahead of time, you can attack them.\n\n1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:35.600\n You can DDoS them, you cause all kinds of problems.\n\n1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:40.600\n So adaptive security, also we moved from an MPC,\n\n1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:42.360\n random number generation, which was great,\n\n1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:44.240\n but very heavy and very slow.\n\n1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.520\n And you can't scale to large amounts of people\n\n1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:48.720\n to a VRF based system, which is super fast,\n\n1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:49.800\n but a little dirtier.\n\n1:05:49.800 --> 1:05:52.160\n Because Algorand actually did some great work there.\n\n1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:53.480\n There was some good knowledge there.\n\n1:05:53.480 --> 1:05:54.840\n What are the really hard problems that you,\n\n1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:56.800\n maybe if you just linger on a little bit,\n\n1:05:56.800 --> 1:05:58.600\n what are some of the really hard problems\n\n1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:01.480\n you have to solve along this chain of papers, ideas,\n\n1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:03.140\n the evolution of the consensus algorithm?\n\n1:06:03.140 --> 1:06:05.000\n Yeah, not only are they really hard problems,\n\n1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.760\n they actually require different cryptographers\n\n1:06:06.760 --> 1:06:10.600\n because you're moving from mathematician style cryptographers\n\n1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:12.720\n like the Neil Koblitz's and the Addie Shamir's\n\n1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:14.960\n and the people that like start as proper mathematicians.\n\n1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:17.720\n They really love theory and that's their thing.\n\n1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.620\n And the proofs are dense and they're thick\n\n1:06:19.620 --> 1:06:23.720\n and they're beautiful to practical applied work\n\n1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:24.960\n where you're saying, okay,\n\n1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:27.120\n now this is something an engineer can look at\n\n1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:28.660\n and say, I know how to build that.\n\n1:06:28.660 --> 1:06:30.140\n I know how to think about that.\n\n1:06:30.140 --> 1:06:34.560\n So that transition from GKL to Ouroboros Classic\n\n1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:38.880\n to Prowse, I'd say the biggest leap was Classic to Prowse\n\n1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:40.960\n because that was going from a system\n\n1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:43.640\n that would only work in a consortium chain like Fabric\n\n1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:45.840\n to a system that would actually work and is working.\n\n1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:47.960\n That's what's implementing Cardano today,\n\n1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:50.720\n 50 billion dollar cryptocurrency and all these people.\n\n1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:54.240\n That was a huge leap, but that paper alone wasn't enough.\n\n1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:56.940\n We also had to layer on the economic model\n\n1:06:56.940 --> 1:06:58.960\n because we said, well, hang on a second here.\n\n1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.120\n Not everybody's gonna be online all the time\n\n1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:03.460\n to be available to make a block.\n\n1:07:03.460 --> 1:07:05.440\n So you need some notion of delegation.\n\n1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:06.920\n The minute you have a notion of delegation,\n\n1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:09.360\n you have these stake pools, what the hell does that mean?\n\n1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:12.920\n And so this is a beautiful kind of interdisciplinary notion\n\n1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.060\n that layers computer science and biology together.\n\n1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:18.080\n And minute that complexity starts going up,\n\n1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:20.440\n you start seeing cell specialization.\n\n1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:23.260\n So you go from single cell organisms to organisms\n\n1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:26.040\n where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts\n\n1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:28.140\n and each of these tissues do different things.\n\n1:07:28.140 --> 1:07:30.820\n Well, analogously, complex distributed systems\n\n1:07:30.820 --> 1:07:32.100\n start getting specialization.\n\n1:07:32.100 --> 1:07:34.800\n You move from the single cell thing, Bitcoin,\n\n1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:35.800\n where everything's a full node,\n\n1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:37.540\n they all have the same rights and responsibilities,\n\n1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:39.480\n a lot of homogeneity in that system,\n\n1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:41.020\n but you're only as good as your weakest link,\n\n1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:45.080\n you're only as capable as whatever the basic cell can do\n\n1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:47.080\n to a specialized system where you start having\n\n1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:49.240\n these actors in the system that are actually\n\n1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:51.020\n a little different than the other actors.\n\n1:07:51.020 --> 1:07:53.360\n So you introduce this concept of the stake pool\n\n1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:54.760\n and suddenly now you have this actor\n\n1:07:54.760 --> 1:07:57.680\n where you're probably gonna be online 24 seven.\n\n1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.160\n You're probably gonna have extra relay infrastructure.\n\n1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:03.640\n There's a trust relationship where you don't own the ADA,\n\n1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:05.840\n but you have a right to use it for something.\n\n1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:08.520\n And a person's made that choice to endow you with that.\n\n1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.960\n The minute that you introduce specialization though,\n\n1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:12.560\n the system gets more complicated,\n\n1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.560\n the game theory gets more complicated.\n\n1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:16.300\n And then you start having to think really deeply\n\n1:08:16.300 --> 1:08:18.800\n and carefully about, okay, well,\n\n1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:20.920\n can this now introduce a new attack vector\n\n1:08:20.920 --> 1:08:22.500\n that we didn't have before?\n\n1:08:22.500 --> 1:08:24.960\n So that leap from classic to Prowse\n\n1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.700\n and adding in stake pools and figuring out\n\n1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:29.100\n how to handle the game theory there was exceedingly hard.\n\n1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:30.520\n It took two years to do that.\n\n1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:33.440\n So stake pools allow for multiple parties\n\n1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:36.720\n to delegate their staking capabilities to others.\n\n1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:38.360\n Can you describe a little bit how this works?\n\n1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:39.200\n It's kind of fascinating.\n\n1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:40.560\n It's a super simple concept.\n\n1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:42.760\n So you register a pool and then the pool is there\n\n1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:46.240\n and basically they advertise\n\n1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:48.800\n and they're actually registered on chain with a certificate.\n\n1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.640\n And then in the wallet software itself,\n\n1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:53.360\n you can see all of the pools that have registered.\n\n1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:56.080\n There's over 3000 of them now inside the system.\n\n1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:57.640\n And then you can click a little tile\n\n1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:00.000\n and it shows you all the metadata that's in the certificate\n\n1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.200\n and says, hey, I have my own pool.\n\n1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:05.200\n It's called rats, king of the rats.\n\n1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.360\n So you can see all this stuff that's described there\n\n1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:08.840\n and pools have an operating fee\n\n1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:09.880\n cause they're like a business.\n\n1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.820\n And they say, well, if you delegate to me,\n\n1:09:11.820 --> 1:09:13.120\n I'll charge this much.\n\n1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:15.680\n So if you get like a hundred bucks in rewards,\n\n1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:19.440\n I'll give you 90 and I'll take 10 or something like that.\n\n1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:20.440\n And then you make your decision\n\n1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:23.600\n and whichever one you select, you click delegate,\n\n1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:26.560\n push the button and then you have now given\n\n1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:29.840\n your staking rights to them until revoked.\n\n1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:30.920\n Okay, so it lives there.\n\n1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:33.700\n And then the stake pools weight in the system\n\n1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:35.560\n is proportional to the amount of stake\n\n1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:37.120\n that they have delegated to them.\n\n1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:39.400\n And then we have this other limiting factor K,\n\n1:09:39.400 --> 1:09:41.480\n which says that you get diminishing returns\n\n1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.720\n with the more stake you have.\n\n1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.320\n So it's kind of like an S function.\n\n1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:46.880\n So you kind of go up and up and then eventually caps\n\n1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:48.600\n and then at some point you get no rewards\n\n1:09:48.600 --> 1:09:49.960\n beyond a certain threshold.\n\n1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:51.760\n So there's an incentive to split pools\n\n1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:54.440\n to different owners after some point.\n\n1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:57.080\n Yeah, and so that's a complex thing\n\n1:09:57.080 --> 1:09:59.160\n and you have to actually model the game theory out\n\n1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.520\n to understand where those parameters should be set.\n\n1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:02.840\n And we didn't know how to do that.\n\n1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:04.880\n So what we did is we bought talent.\n\n1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:06.600\n We went to Oxford and we hired this guy\n\n1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:08.920\n named Elias Kasupis, he's an algorithmic game theorist.\n\n1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:11.560\n We said, hey, would you like to do some game theory work\n\n1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:12.400\n in crypto?\n\n1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:13.760\n And he's like, that sounds fun.\n\n1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:15.240\n So he spent a year and a half,\n\n1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:16.680\n we built all these beautiful models\n\n1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:18.320\n and we kind of figured out what those curves\n\n1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:19.160\n needed to look like.\n\n1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:20.600\n So figure out like the S curve that would result\n\n1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:22.880\n in a nice distribution of responsibility.\n\n1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:26.440\n So not everybody delegates to the king of the rats.\n\n1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:27.280\n Exactly.\n\n1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:28.880\n How does it feel to be royalty, by the way?\n\n1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:31.880\n It's not a very impressive kingdom,\n\n1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.280\n but you're nevertheless a king.\n\n1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.240\n I'll take it, because I think it's the kindest thing\n\n1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:36.760\n people call me in this space.\n\n1:10:37.840 --> 1:10:39.200\n Yeah, people love you.\n\n1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.840\n So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that,\n\n1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:43.880\n would you say a solved problem?\n\n1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.480\n The game theory of stake pools?\n\n1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:48.040\n No, it's the starting, and I was getting back\n\n1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:50.480\n to my original point that you build things in iterations.\n\n1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:53.040\n Every step, if you've done it right,\n\n1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:55.840\n is an invitation for 10 more sexy, fascinating,\n\n1:10:55.840 --> 1:10:56.680\n fun problems.\n\n1:10:56.680 --> 1:10:58.760\n And this is why we have such a great time building labs.\n\n1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.360\n We started in Edinburgh, now we're at Tokyo Tech\n\n1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:03.280\n and University of Wyoming and Athens,\n\n1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:05.160\n and we're setting up more labs this year.\n\n1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:06.760\n And all these academics wanna work with us,\n\n1:11:06.760 --> 1:11:09.080\n hey, because we write a lot of really fascinating papers,\n\n1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:12.240\n but B, because we're focused on all these really cool,\n\n1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.120\n sexy, interdisciplinary problems.\n\n1:11:14.120 --> 1:11:15.080\n We're actually running into problems\n\n1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.040\n where we don't even know where to publish the paper.\n\n1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:18.400\n Because you'll have this paper where there's like\n\n1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:20.400\n these PL guys working with crypto guys,\n\n1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:23.120\n working with systems guys, working with economists.\n\n1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:23.960\n And you put it all together\n\n1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:26.160\n and you have this Frankenstein paper monster,\n\n1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:27.920\n and we're like, where do we submit this?\n\n1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:28.960\n Where does this go?\n\n1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:29.800\n Nature.\n\n1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:30.720\n Yeah, there we go.\n\n1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.880\n Nature or quanta or something, I don't know.\n\n1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:33.720\n It'll write a nice little.\n\n1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:36.520\n So the sexy problems multiply exponentially.\n\n1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:39.000\n Exactly, and we've now gotten to a point\n\n1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.040\n where we're starting to work on refinements to the system\n\n1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.920\n rather than fundamental things that are like,\n\n1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:47.440\n if you don't solve it, the system just simply doesn't work.\n\n1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:49.920\n For example, you can run all of this with NTP\n\n1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:50.840\n as your clock server,\n\n1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:52.680\n but you actually can create a notion of time with N.\n\n1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:55.520\n We wrote a paper called the Workforce Chronos for that.\n\n1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:58.280\n But that's not necessary for the system.\n\n1:11:58.280 --> 1:11:59.520\n It's just a nice to have thing.\n\n1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:00.400\n It's a nice property.\n\n1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.080\n Optimization of the random number generation\n\n1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:03.040\n is another example of that.\n\n1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:04.680\n You can run it with a heavier thing.\n\n1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:06.080\n You just have more blockchain bloat\n\n1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:08.440\n and slower time and transition.\n\n1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:09.920\n We have this concept in Epic.\n\n1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:13.840\n So you elect leaders to run the system\n\n1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.760\n every five days with Cardano,\n\n1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:17.120\n but there's been derivative work.\n\n1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:18.120\n We didn't even do this.\n\n1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:20.000\n This work occurred at University of Illinois.\n\n1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:21.160\n And that derivative work said,\n\n1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:22.360\n well, you don't actually need to do that.\n\n1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:24.520\n You can do it on a block by block basis.\n\n1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:26.160\n It's like, ooh, that's pretty cool.\n\n1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:27.560\n So that's the other point about doing things\n\n1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:31.040\n in a very rigorous way is that that way\n\n1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:33.880\n creates a lingua franca for what you're trying to solve\n\n1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:36.400\n with the totality of the academic community.\n\n1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.360\n So suddenly people that you've never met,\n\n1:12:38.360 --> 1:12:40.480\n you know nothing about have read your papers,\n\n1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:43.040\n cited your papers and start writing their own papers,\n\n1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:45.720\n either to try to attack and destroy things you've done\n\n1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:48.080\n or to build on top of the things that you've done.\n\n1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:50.360\n So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this.\n\n1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:51.200\n Exactly.\n\n1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.920\n As rigorous as you are trying to build up.\n\n1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:54.120\n And I don't have to pay them.\n\n1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:54.960\n That's the beautiful thing.\n\n1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:55.880\n It's fun.\n\n1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:56.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:57.560\n It's fun to try to destroy\n\n1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:58.400\n and that's how we grow stronger.\n\n1:12:58.400 --> 1:12:59.840\n And it's how you build your career too.\n\n1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:02.280\n There's plenty of people that they've gotten tenure\n\n1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:04.920\n just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX.\n\n1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:06.960\n You go to CCS every year, there's some guy there\n\n1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:09.480\n and he's having a hell of a time making Intel cry.\n\n1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:13.320\n Can we pull back historically speaking\n\n1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:14.760\n and in terms of the big picture\n\n1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:16.200\n of cryptocurrency real quick\n\n1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.040\n and ask the question, what is Cardano?\n\n1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:20.440\n We started talking about already\n\n1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:23.480\n the consensus algorithm Cardano takes.\n\n1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:26.320\n But maybe when you look at the history books,\n\n1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.800\n you know, sort of a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.200\n and Cardano will have one sentence.\n\n1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.320\n What's that one sentence going to be?\n\n1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.320\n And in general, what's like the vision\n\n1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:37.560\n in the context of the history of cryptocurrency?\n\n1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:39.560\n You have like this whiteboard overview video\n\n1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:43.040\n that you talk about the three generations of cryptocurrency\n\n1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:44.400\n where Cardano is the third.\n\n1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:47.680\n So that's like five different questions\n\n1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:49.600\n way of asking the exact same thing you can answer\n\n1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:50.800\n however the hell you want.\n\n1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:55.320\n You know, I always termed Cardano as like a FOSS,\n\n1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:57.880\n a financial operating system and nobody likes it\n\n1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:00.000\n and everybody picks on me for using that term.\n\n1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.560\n But basically the idea is that, you know,\n\n1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:04.360\n the world runs on systems, especially the financial world.\n\n1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:06.760\n You have, you know, the BIS and Swift\n\n1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:07.840\n and all this other stuff.\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:11.640\n And these protocols allow you to move value around\n\n1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:13.400\n and represent things like identity.\n\n1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:17.040\n And allow you to express yourself in some way.\n\n1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.920\n And those protocols for the most part work well\n\n1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:22.040\n for people in rich countries.\n\n1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:23.240\n And they don't work so well\n\n1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:25.560\n for people who aren't in rich countries.\n\n1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:29.380\n And so the point of what we do, or at least what I do\n\n1:14:29.380 --> 1:14:32.160\n and what my company does is we think a lot about\n\n1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:34.200\n how do we build a universal protocol\n\n1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:36.560\n that does all the stuff the legacy system has\n\n1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.420\n but just does it better, faster and cheaper\n\n1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:39.840\n for everybody in the world.\n\n1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:42.080\n And everybody has equal access to it, you know?\n\n1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:43.560\n So it's the people's protocol.\n\n1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:46.240\n You know, you have a situation where the guy in Senegal\n\n1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:48.800\n has the same access that I do or Bill Gates does\n\n1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:50.480\n or someone else who's kind of higher\n\n1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.880\n on the spectrum of wealth and power.\n\n1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:56.760\n And so that is what we seek to achieve.\n\n1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:59.480\n But then the question is well, is Cardano the solution?\n\n1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:01.480\n You know, is that that thing?\n\n1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:02.680\n And the answer is no,\n\n1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.520\n because you need a lot more evolution.\n\n1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:06.960\n You need decades of evolution\n\n1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:08.860\n to kind of work your way there.\n\n1:15:08.860 --> 1:15:11.160\n And in many ways the work is never quite done\n\n1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:13.960\n but it's better than what came before.\n\n1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:14.800\n Why?\n\n1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.160\n Because you have a realization that first\n\n1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:19.760\n the control of the system needs to be more balanced\n\n1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.640\n and nuanced and it needs to be more democratic.\n\n1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:25.680\n So there's this sustainability component\n\n1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:28.380\n of who's in charge and how do you pay for things?\n\n1:15:28.380 --> 1:15:30.040\n Well, the system can print its own money\n\n1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:31.920\n so it always has the ability to have a budget.\n\n1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:34.200\n Okay, so there's a treasury idea.\n\n1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:35.800\n And then there's a voting thing.\n\n1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:38.040\n Well, the same things that allow you to move money around\n\n1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:39.320\n allow you to represent votes.\n\n1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:42.240\n So you can do eVoting with the type of system, okay.\n\n1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.880\n And you know, if you played Gnomic in the 1980s\n\n1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:46.620\n or Peter Superfan or any of these things,\n\n1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:48.300\n you can build a self evolving system.\n\n1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:49.520\n You can actually create a game\n\n1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:51.380\n where the rules can be voted on and changed\n\n1:15:51.380 --> 1:15:53.800\n in the game itself, great.\n\n1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:56.080\n Okay, so that exists there.\n\n1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:57.460\n And then you say, okay, well,\n\n1:15:57.460 --> 1:15:59.760\n but this thing still has to touch the legacy world.\n\n1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.760\n There has to be cash in and cash out\n\n1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:02.880\n and these types of things.\n\n1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:04.560\n So there's just this interoperability thing\n\n1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:07.140\n that you need a wifi or a Bluetooth moment for the industry\n\n1:16:07.140 --> 1:16:08.720\n because nothing understands each other right now.\n\n1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:10.520\n There are all these chains are blind, deaf\n\n1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:11.640\n and dumb to each other.\n\n1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:13.160\n And then there's this thing that it has to work\n\n1:16:13.160 --> 1:16:15.760\n at a huge scale, like billions of people.\n\n1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.320\n And we've done that, but we've done that\n\n1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:19.840\n with large multinational trillion dollar companies\n\n1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:21.280\n with centralized infrastructure.\n\n1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:24.360\n We've never really done that with one master protocol\n\n1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:25.520\n that somehow does it for everyone.\n\n1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:28.080\n The closest approximation is probably BitTorrent.\n\n1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:31.520\n And there's, you know, there was, it's a cool protocol,\n\n1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:34.640\n but it doesn't have all the oomph necessary to,\n\n1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:36.520\n necessary to do something like this.\n\n1:16:36.520 --> 1:16:38.880\n So Cardano is just our first approximation\n\n1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:40.960\n and like any good system,\n\n1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:42.640\n we wanted it to be self evolving.\n\n1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:44.960\n So once you get the philosophy out of where's the target\n\n1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:47.880\n of what do you want to do, then you build a community.\n\n1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:49.720\n Now it's over a million people strong\n\n1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:51.360\n and that community keeps growing\n\n1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:52.860\n and they keep pushing the system\n\n1:16:52.860 --> 1:16:54.240\n in that particular direction.\n\n1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:56.760\n And what's nice about it is if you build the right philosophy\n\n1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:58.920\n within the system, it doesn't need founders.\n\n1:16:58.920 --> 1:17:00.560\n This is the great lesson of Satoshi.\n\n1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:02.860\n It doesn't need founders to be able to get there.\n\n1:17:02.860 --> 1:17:07.860\n So, you know, if you look at the academic side,\n\n1:17:07.940 --> 1:17:09.740\n that's very decentralized.\n\n1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:11.720\n We have more than 30 different contributors\n\n1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:14.280\n for the 105 papers and that set keeps growing\n\n1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:15.280\n within the next five years.\n\n1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:18.100\n It'll probably be two, three, 400 different scientists\n\n1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:20.680\n from all across the world, some from Russia\n\n1:17:20.680 --> 1:17:23.520\n and some from India, some from China and some from Japan\n\n1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:25.920\n and America and Africa and South America.\n\n1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:28.800\n And the faces change, the languages change,\n\n1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.520\n the cultures change, but the process stays the same.\n\n1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:34.400\n And that is a permanent organ\n\n1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.920\n within what we have constructed as a system.\n\n1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:38.960\n And it's the same situation entering marketplaces.\n\n1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:41.320\n Like we entered Ethiopia, what are we doing there?\n\n1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:43.060\n We have 5 million people in Ethiopia.\n\n1:17:43.060 --> 1:17:44.840\n We're getting them digital identity\n\n1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:47.160\n and we're dragging that digital identity into the system.\n\n1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:48.440\n Cause that's the most fundamental thing\n\n1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:50.120\n of a financial operating system.\n\n1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:51.720\n You need to know who people are\n\n1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:53.320\n in order to be able to do business with them,\n\n1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:56.160\n give them credit, be able to give them economic agency\n\n1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.000\n and so the thing.\n\n1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:58.200\n But once they're there,\n\n1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:00.280\n they're going to grow up with that system.\n\n1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:02.280\n They're going to deploy applications on that system.\n\n1:18:02.280 --> 1:18:03.400\n They're going to build on that system\n\n1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:05.200\n or use it every day for getting a loan\n\n1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:06.480\n or payments and so forth.\n\n1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:07.980\n And if they have pain points,\n\n1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:10.480\n what they're going to do is evolve that system\n\n1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:11.440\n to be able to mitigate,\n\n1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:13.600\n manage those particular pain points\n\n1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:16.360\n to a point where the system is competitive for it.\n\n1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:18.880\n So my job is to be,\n\n1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:21.920\n we have this tagline in our company, cascading disruption.\n\n1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:23.740\n My job is to be the first domino.\n\n1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:26.600\n Just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade\n\n1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:28.400\n and it kind of blows and blows and blows up\n\n1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:31.280\n until eventually it gets to where we need to go.\n\n1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:33.520\n And what I was trying to think about with Cardano\n\n1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:36.560\n was how do you build the minimum viable set\n\n1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:40.200\n of tools and social processes\n\n1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.080\n that once we push the domino,\n\n1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:43.880\n the system will just evolve to a point\n\n1:18:43.880 --> 1:18:46.200\n where eventually you can grow to fill that need,\n\n1:18:46.200 --> 1:18:49.360\n not out of charity, but out of self interest.\n\n1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:51.880\n People want things better, faster, cheaper.\n\n1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:54.740\n People want to have economic agency,\n\n1:18:54.740 --> 1:18:56.280\n especially when they lack it.\n\n1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:59.220\n Nobody wants to grow up in a world where they're unbanked\n\n1:18:59.220 --> 1:19:01.080\n and they have no access to marketplaces.\n\n1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:02.260\n They're gonna seek it.\n\n1:19:02.260 --> 1:19:03.240\n Look at Mpesa.\n\n1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:06.240\n It's the great example of that, like cell phone minutes\n\n1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:07.840\n they're using as a currency.\n\n1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:09.760\n So that's where we're at.\n\n1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:10.860\n And I say a few more years,\n\n1:19:10.860 --> 1:19:13.840\n I think we'll have that rate minimum viable set of dynamics\n\n1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:15.120\n inside the system.\n\n1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:16.920\n And then it's inevitable in my view\n\n1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:20.200\n that it'll kind of grow and consume and become this concept.\n\n1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:21.640\n And what's really cool is there's competition\n\n1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:22.760\n in the systems and concepts.\n\n1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:24.760\n So China is trying to do the same thing.\n\n1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:26.800\n They're saying, how do we de dollarize the world\n\n1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:28.280\n and create a digital Yuan?\n\n1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:30.180\n So they have a very top down notion\n\n1:19:30.180 --> 1:19:32.200\n of how to apply this technology and bring it in.\n\n1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.440\n And they even have an identity system\n\n1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:35.720\n they're building in parallel called social credit.\n\n1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:36.680\n We have an identity system,\n\n1:19:36.680 --> 1:19:38.240\n a talaprism that we're putting in.\n\n1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:40.300\n Ours is bottom up and you own your own identity,\n\n1:19:40.300 --> 1:19:41.140\n social credit.\n\n1:19:41.140 --> 1:19:41.960\n You have no idea.\n\n1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:43.960\n You just have a number and some computers giving it to you,\n\n1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:46.140\n but they're both trying to do the exact same thing.\n\n1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:49.020\n And it's gonna be this clash of cultures at some point\n\n1:19:49.020 --> 1:19:50.780\n between the open fosses\n\n1:19:50.780 --> 1:19:53.160\n and the top down authoritarian fosses\n\n1:19:53.160 --> 1:19:56.040\n and probably some Hegelian dialectic action to happen.\n\n1:19:56.040 --> 1:19:59.120\n We'll create some sort of somewhat closed,\n\n1:19:59.120 --> 1:20:02.760\n somewhat authoritarian, libertarian utopia.\n\n1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.560\n Yeah, most likely it would be AIs battling\n\n1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:06.680\n in the space of fosses.\n\n1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:08.980\n So I really like this idea of financial operating system,\n\n1:20:08.980 --> 1:20:13.520\n but the letter F, so financial,\n\n1:20:13.520 --> 1:20:18.020\n is this just a basic mechanism\n\n1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:19.920\n with which you can have social interaction\n\n1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:22.320\n therefore or all kinds of interactions\n\n1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:23.740\n therefore have an identity?\n\n1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:26.180\n Like is F essential to this?\n\n1:20:26.180 --> 1:20:28.220\n Yeah, because that's how people care.\n\n1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:30.320\n You need resources to survive.\n\n1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:32.520\n And finances is kind of like this field\n\n1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:36.160\n of managing your resources in an intelligent way.\n\n1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:38.920\n And you could call it SOFI too, social finance.\n\n1:20:38.920 --> 1:20:42.400\n The nomenclature hasn't exactly been settled\n\n1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:44.440\n for our industry and that's fun.\n\n1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:48.800\n But basically the concept is that you have something\n\n1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:51.280\n and you wanna be able to store it, transform it,\n\n1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:54.040\n trade it and use it to survive.\n\n1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:56.720\n And the question is what rails do you do that on?\n\n1:20:56.720 --> 1:20:59.360\n Do you do those on centralized controlled rails\n\n1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:01.280\n where there are these third parties\n\n1:21:01.280 --> 1:21:04.440\n that are basically able to live off those things,\n\n1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:06.020\n become very fat and nepotistic?\n\n1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:08.620\n Or do you wanna do it on rails where there's no middleman?\n\n1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:09.960\n You have a direct relationship\n\n1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:11.280\n with whoever you're doing business\n\n1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:13.200\n and if you invite more people into the transaction,\n\n1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:15.580\n they're middlemen of value, not necessity.\n\n1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:17.560\n And that's really the, I would like to say\n\n1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:19.240\n the resident detra of our space,\n\n1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:21.600\n that the reason we exist is to try to figure out a way\n\n1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:24.260\n to kill the middleman and try to figure out a way\n\n1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:27.060\n that we can better quantify value and transform it,\n\n1:21:27.060 --> 1:21:28.480\n move it, manipulate it.\n\n1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:30.260\n And in many ways we've actually discovered\n\n1:21:30.260 --> 1:21:32.760\n some amazing things in the last 10 years as an industry.\n\n1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:35.440\n Like we've kind of created the financial stem cell.\n\n1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:37.800\n This idea of a token can now is just as well\n\n1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:39.880\n be a national currency as a CBDC\n\n1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:42.560\n as it can represent a crypto kitty.\n\n1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:46.100\n The same architecture can do stuff at the nation scale,\n\n1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:48.400\n can do stuff for a 12 year old kid in Texas.\n\n1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:50.040\n It's pretty amazing to see that.\n\n1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:54.960\n But sort of in that whiteboard presentation,\n\n1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:58.920\n you gave these three phases and you're kind of implying\n\n1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:02.800\n that there'll be end phases to this whole evolution.\n\n1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:05.400\n And Cardano is just like the cutting edge.\n\n1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:08.800\n But if you look back to Bitcoin,\n\n1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:12.320\n how would you compare Cardano versus Bitcoin?\n\n1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:16.200\n Sort of where we are, how we started and how it's going.\n\n1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:20.080\n Okay, so what I did in that video and I've done\n\n1:22:20.080 --> 1:22:21.360\n in a lot of media interviews,\n\n1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:23.560\n because I think it really helps people understand\n\n1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:26.560\n where we're at in the clock is face things\n\n1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:27.760\n in terms of generations.\n\n1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:29.920\n And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin.\n\n1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:31.800\n And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve\n\n1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:34.880\n is saying every time we wanna represent or move value,\n\n1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:39.000\n we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that.\n\n1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.480\n So can we build some sort of system\n\n1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:42.320\n where we can create some notion of value\n\n1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:44.880\n that can be teleported around the world\n\n1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:47.240\n and it doesn't require a trusted third party?\n\n1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:48.080\n That's it.\n\n1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:49.720\n And it's done in a beautiful way\n\n1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:52.480\n because it didn't try to be anything else.\n\n1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:54.480\n It just was, you only have Bitcoin,\n\n1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:56.760\n you can only do one type of thing, you can only push it.\n\n1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:58.760\n You can do some things on the encumbrances\n\n1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:00.680\n of like multi SIG and other things,\n\n1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:04.200\n but that's a one trick pony as a system.\n\n1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:06.440\n And it wasn't really clear if that was gonna work or not\n\n1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:07.280\n for a long time.\n\n1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:09.800\n It took several years to build up enough network effect\n\n1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:12.160\n and for Bitcoins to actually become valuable.\n\n1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:15.160\n And I'd say the inflection point was 2013.\n\n1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:17.720\n And at that point it became a billion dollar market cap.\n\n1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:20.000\n There were like Silicon Valley startups,\n\n1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.640\n real exchanges performing.\n\n1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:23.640\n And it got to a point where there was legitimacy\n\n1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:25.480\n behind the concept and people started getting,\n\n1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:27.520\n this is a really incredible idea\n\n1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:29.920\n because I can evade capital controls with it.\n\n1:23:29.920 --> 1:23:32.800\n I can like move $10 billion of something\n\n1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:35.080\n from one country to another country in five minutes.\n\n1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:36.800\n It's like, I could never do that before.\n\n1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:38.920\n And you know, this is incredible.\n\n1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:42.000\n Okay, the problem is the minute that people validate\n\n1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.280\n the idea, they immediately want something they don't have.\n\n1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:48.880\n So like the minute Elon can land a rocket,\n\n1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.480\n there's the next big thing, right?\n\n1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:53.600\n You've landed the Falcon 9, now you're on the Starship.\n\n1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:55.000\n Similarly, you say, okay,\n\n1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.480\n I want programmability with this thing.\n\n1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:59.800\n It's kind of like when JavaScript came to the web browser,\n\n1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:02.240\n you went from these static, perhaps pretty,\n\n1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.480\n but ultimately static non interactive pages\n\n1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:08.080\n to YouTube and Google and Facebook\n\n1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:10.840\n and these amazing, rich, incredible experiences,\n\n1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.240\n because now you can actually interact with the user.\n\n1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:15.520\n You can program things, stuff runs on their side,\n\n1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:16.800\n stuff runs on your side.\n\n1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:19.160\n It's a beautiful two way relationship.\n\n1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:21.280\n So that's what Ethereum effectively did.\n\n1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.120\n They bolted a programming language onto a blockchain\n\n1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:27.640\n and they went from a certain use case\n\n1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:30.040\n to whatever your imagination can have,\n\n1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:32.520\n you know, like sunshine and rainbows and unicorns\n\n1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:33.360\n and these types of things.\n\n1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:35.800\n So what you're saying is Bitcoin is HTML\n\n1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:37.400\n and Ethereum is JavaScript?\n\n1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:39.360\n Basically, yeah, it was like when JavaScript came\n\n1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:41.040\n and with like JavaScript,\n\n1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:43.200\n it has all kinds of problems and issues.\n\n1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:46.080\n I wonder who's flash in this analogy, this metaphor,\n\n1:24:46.080 --> 1:24:47.080\n but let's not go there.\n\n1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:49.480\n Well, actually there were plenty of active Xs and flashes.\n\n1:24:49.480 --> 1:24:52.120\n NXT was an example of a failed to start\n\n1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:54.120\n and BitShares was another example.\n\n1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:56.120\n There were a lot of people who tried to add some notion\n\n1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:58.600\n of programmability in or a different view\n\n1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:00.200\n of how these things should be done\n\n1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:02.040\n and they were not as competitive.\n\n1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:04.320\n Ethereum kind of came out at that JavaScript moment.\n\n1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:05.400\n Okay, the minute you have that,\n\n1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:09.640\n and suddenly you have ICOs and DeFi and STOs and NFTs\n\n1:25:09.640 --> 1:25:12.000\n and all these word salads of things\n\n1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:13.920\n and then people start using it, they get frustrated.\n\n1:25:13.920 --> 1:25:14.760\n Why?\n\n1:25:14.760 --> 1:25:16.600\n Because it's too slow, it's too expensive,\n\n1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:18.760\n it doesn't talk to the things they want it to talk to\n\n1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:21.840\n and also it gets too big to manage itself.\n\n1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:25.120\n When you're small, you have founders and foundations\n\n1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:27.400\n and you have trusted actors and core developers\n\n1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:29.240\n and you can feed them with pizzas.\n\n1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:30.720\n You know them, you can meet them,\n\n1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:32.560\n you can shake their hands at conferences.\n\n1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:36.560\n When you're a multi billion person system,\n\n1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:39.880\n you're too large to be able to do that.\n\n1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:42.880\n For example, we had the Shelley Summit last year,\n\n1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:44.880\n we invited Vint Cerf to come to the summit.\n\n1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:47.560\n Vint's a brilliant guy and he created the internet\n\n1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:49.200\n with Bob and the rest of the gang\n\n1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:53.460\n and back in those days, it was such a simple small system\n\n1:25:53.460 --> 1:25:56.000\n that one of their students, they said,\n\n1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:56.840\n hey, you need to test it.\n\n1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:58.400\n He created a video game just to kind of test the thing.\n\n1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:00.120\n You could call the guy on the other side and say,\n\n1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:00.960\n are you seeing this?\n\n1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:01.840\n Are you getting the signal?\n\n1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.000\n They used to have a actual address book for email addresses.\n\n1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.640\n Yeah, so you'd open up the book and look it up\n\n1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:08.480\n and they'll look at the internet,\n\n1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:10.040\n it's like, who's in charge of that?\n\n1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.880\n It's this gargantuan network\n\n1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:15.340\n and there's no group of people you can bring in\n\n1:26:15.340 --> 1:26:18.960\n and thus the internet evolves very slowly, you see?\n\n1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:21.360\n And so that's the problem is that you have this situation\n\n1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:23.340\n where you wanna do lots of utility,\n\n1:26:23.340 --> 1:26:24.180\n you wanna do a lot of things,\n\n1:26:24.180 --> 1:26:26.100\n you wanna be a financial operating system\n\n1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:28.800\n and be everything to everyone\n\n1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:30.660\n but then your rate of evolution slows down\n\n1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:32.560\n as your rate of adoption speeds up.\n\n1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.040\n So that's one of the other design goals\n\n1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:35.880\n of the third generation.\n\n1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:37.680\n It's not good enough just to do things better, faster,\n\n1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:39.840\n cheaper and have consistent cost\n\n1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:41.500\n with your population growing\n\n1:26:41.500 --> 1:26:43.880\n or talk to everything, your wifi moment.\n\n1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.480\n You also need a system that can govern itself\n\n1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:48.280\n at a scale of millions to billions of people\n\n1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:49.740\n who have divergent interests.\n\n1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:52.400\n Some cases ice pick an eye divergent interest.\n\n1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:55.440\n They really hate each other and they don't get along.\n\n1:26:55.440 --> 1:26:56.800\n And so that's what we termed\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:58.360\n a third generation cryptocurrency\n\n1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:00.920\n and there's a lot of people attempting to compete\n\n1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:01.760\n in that space.\n\n1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:05.840\n There's Tezos and Algran and ICP and Polkadot and so forth.\n\n1:27:05.840 --> 1:27:07.580\n And each and every one of them kind of brings\n\n1:27:07.580 --> 1:27:09.640\n a different blend of things that they value.\n\n1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.600\n So it's not completely equal\n\n1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:14.640\n between scalability, interoperability and sustainability.\n\n1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.280\n Some people were very focused on high throughput,\n\n1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:19.200\n lots of transactions perspective.\n\n1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:21.720\n Other people very focused on governance\n\n1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.880\n like Tezos is like the governance chain\n\n1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:25.920\n and they were one of the first\n\n1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:27.280\n to do a self amending ledger.\n\n1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:30.120\n And other people are like Aeon or Polkadot.\n\n1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:31.320\n They're really thinking carefully\n\n1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:34.040\n about how do we build a nice interoperable ecosystem.\n\n1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:36.000\n With Cardano, we tried to actually tackle all three\n\n1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.600\n at the same time, which was one of the reasons\n\n1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:39.920\n why we were a little slower out of the gate.\n\n1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:41.320\n We had to write a lot more protocols\n\n1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:42.960\n but we think we've kind of come up\n\n1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:45.880\n with a beautiful interlocking design for all of them.\n\n1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:48.160\n And again, the point is not to get it perfect\n\n1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:52.040\n but rather get those just right set of evolutionary factors\n\n1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:54.640\n that when you click the domino,\n\n1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:57.520\n it just self evolves into what you need it to get to.\n\n1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.800\n Allow me to stretch the metaphor farther.\n\n1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:04.920\n If Bitcoin is HTML, there's HTML5.\n\n1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:07.680\n If Ethereum is JavaScript, JavaScript with V8\n\n1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:09.600\n has become quite fast, quite, you know,\n\n1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:11.240\n it runs much of the internet.\n\n1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:15.600\n So the argument could be that eventually everything\n\n1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:18.440\n will be JavaScript or maybe you could say\n\n1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:20.600\n eventually everything will be HTML\n\n1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:22.160\n and it should be a bunch of different tools\n\n1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:23.800\n that generate that HTML.\n\n1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:28.280\n So is it possible that just like Rousseau,\n\n1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:32.000\n we eventually return to generation one Bitcoin\n\n1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.120\n or we return to generation two Ethereum\n\n1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:39.360\n at the end of this journey?\n\n1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:42.280\n Yeah, the problem is your tail is wagging the dog there.\n\n1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:44.360\n And it's not, you have a situation\n\n1:28:44.360 --> 1:28:46.640\n where you're so focused on the technology\n\n1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:48.640\n that you're failing to understand\n\n1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:50.520\n that there's still Daisy here.\n\n1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:53.120\n You still have the user and where's the app store?\n\n1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:54.800\n Where's the one click install?\n\n1:28:54.800 --> 1:28:56.160\n Where's the use and utility?\n\n1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:58.040\n You know, all these layer two protocols\n\n1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.880\n and these DeFi applications in five years,\n\n1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:03.200\n they're completely protocol and blockchain agnostic\n\n1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:04.040\n because at the end of the day,\n\n1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:06.000\n they care about liquidity, operating cost\n\n1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.400\n and user experience.\n\n1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:10.360\n It's so a preposterous and absurd for somebody to say,\n\n1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:13.000\n oh, well, I'm gonna go build my application,\n\n1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.840\n get on the Apple store\n\n1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:17.480\n and I am gonna use Amazon as my web host.\n\n1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:20.440\n And no matter what happens, I will always use Amazon\n\n1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:22.200\n even if the operating cost is crazy.\n\n1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:23.280\n I see. You see?\n\n1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.920\n And so we're just in a unique period of history\n\n1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:27.160\n where there's a network effect\n\n1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:29.120\n around some initial infrastructure\n\n1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:30.840\n and people tend to be building around that,\n\n1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:34.920\n but every single one of the top DeFi providers\n\n1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:36.680\n are if they're getting successful\n\n1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:38.000\n into a certain network effect,\n\n1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.400\n they're having the multi chain conversation.\n\n1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:42.560\n So I don't really believe in a winner takes all\n\n1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:45.120\n maximums view of, well, there's gonna be some protocol\n\n1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.640\n that becomes the God protocol first\n\n1:29:46.640 --> 1:29:48.400\n because they evolved too quickly.\n\n1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.920\n Second, the incentives aren't aligned for that.\n\n1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:53.240\n TCPIP didn't have a token connected to it.\n\n1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:55.000\n There was no financial incentive\n\n1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.320\n where if TCPIP got adopted over something else,\n\n1:29:57.320 --> 1:30:00.160\n they'd make some big company crazy amounts of money.\n\n1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:02.680\n It was a useful piece of infrastructure.\n\n1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:06.080\n So I think that the third generation is gonna be as defined\n\n1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:09.080\n by the social components and the usability components\n\n1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:12.360\n as it is by the technological capabilities of the system.\n\n1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:14.680\n Really what these technological capabilities gave you\n\n1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:18.040\n was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept\n\n1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:19.240\n and say these things are possible.\n\n1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:22.600\n Kind of like Xerox PARC, when Steve and Bill came in,\n\n1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:25.240\n they said, wow, you have networked computers,\n\n1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:28.520\n object oriented programming and a GUI.\n\n1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:30.400\n And this is like, what was it, 70s?\n\n1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:32.000\n It's like, wow, it's like incredible.\n\n1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:33.520\n But none of that was an actual product.\n\n1:30:33.520 --> 1:30:37.240\n That wasn't a Macintosh, but it was enough to get the idea.\n\n1:30:37.240 --> 1:30:39.400\n And then it was a race to how do we productize\n\n1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:40.280\n something like that.\n\n1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:43.120\n And in that case, it actually took several decades\n\n1:30:43.120 --> 1:30:45.200\n to roll out that vision that those guys had.\n\n1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:47.720\n And I think that's what Bitcoin and Ethereum did.\n\n1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:50.400\n But what's unique about this is normally you throw away\n\n1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:51.720\n the prior experiments.\n\n1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:54.040\n With these things, these are self evolving systems.\n\n1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:57.480\n So it's entirely possible to, Joe Rogan quote,\n\n1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:01.080\n to evolve Bitcoin to a point where it could become\n\n1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:02.960\n a third generation system if desired,\n\n1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:05.720\n as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols.\n\n1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:06.920\n And it's the same for Ethereum.\n\n1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:09.080\n In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum\n\n1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:10.960\n and replacing with Ethereum too,\n\n1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.760\n because he recognizes he needs to upgrade\n\n1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:13.800\n and evolve the system.\n\n1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:16.880\n And that's what makes it fun because the techniques\n\n1:31:16.880 --> 1:31:19.120\n and methodologies that they've chosen to evolve\n\n1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.840\n and upgrade this system are distinctly different\n\n1:31:22.840 --> 1:31:24.280\n from the ones that we've chosen.\n\n1:31:24.280 --> 1:31:26.800\n And we have no idea which one's actually going to win,\n\n1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:29.160\n but we learn from each other and we co evolve\n\n1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:30.000\n from each other.\n\n1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.520\n So you're running like all these experiments in real time\n\n1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:35.720\n in a giant marketplace, and maybe they'll consolidate,\n\n1:31:35.720 --> 1:31:36.880\n maybe they'll stay divergent.\n\n1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:39.200\n I mean, look at big tech, you have Google, Apple,\n\n1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:41.240\n Microsoft, Facebook, they all coexist\n\n1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:42.880\n and they're trillion dollar companies.\n\n1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:46.120\n Some cases with TCP, it consolidates to one standard.\n\n1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:47.720\n And that's what we ended up using.\n\n1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:51.760\n So what's your intuition with Cardano having the proof\n\n1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:55.560\n of stake, and then eventually smart contracts\n\n1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:59.040\n versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies,\n\n1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:01.040\n this kind of evolving creature.\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.160\n Again, you said you can't really predict the future,\n\n1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:09.160\n but what's your intuition why one might be more successful\n\n1:32:09.160 --> 1:32:10.800\n than the other?\n\n1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:15.000\n So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow.\n\n1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.000\n It's like the mainframe programming of the past.\n\n1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.120\n And the only reason it's still around is because\n\n1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:22.280\n there was so much invested in keeping it around\n\n1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.200\n that we just kind of have to leave it there\n\n1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:26.440\n and one day Cobalt will die.\n\n1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:32.560\n There's nothing about it from a collection of USPs\n\n1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:34.200\n that's particularly desirable.\n\n1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:36.040\n You have extremely long settlement time,\n\n1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:38.240\n you have extremely low programmability.\n\n1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:39.760\n It is not aware of any other system.\n\n1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:42.400\n There's no native way of issuing an asset in that system.\n\n1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.200\n You can't even do a pull transaction.\n\n1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:47.120\n You can't do anything that's interesting or unique there.\n\n1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:50.000\n And yeah, all due respect, it's, you know,\n\n1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.520\n mafia, all due respect, Tom.\n\n1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:54.200\n You got some problems.\n\n1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:55.040\n You need to lose some weight.\n\n1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:56.640\n You come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding.\n\n1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:57.480\n I know, I know.\n\n1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.440\n So, you know, all due respect to the Bitcoin people.\n\n1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:03.240\n It's like an amazing, incredible first generation thing.\n\n1:33:03.240 --> 1:33:06.520\n And it really, we're all here because of Bitcoin.\n\n1:33:06.520 --> 1:33:08.600\n But the problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing.\n\n1:33:08.600 --> 1:33:11.600\n You know, just because you were a high school football star\n\n1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:14.400\n doesn't mean that 30 years later you're still\n\n1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:16.320\n a high school football star in the same shape.\n\n1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:17.720\n You got the beer belly, you're old,\n\n1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:18.880\n you're not doing this thing again.\n\n1:33:18.880 --> 1:33:20.480\n And that's what Bitcoin has to do.\n\n1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:22.000\n There's fundamental improvements\n\n1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.600\n that I think Bitcoin can make at the protocol level\n\n1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:28.280\n that would actually make it an incredibly competitive system.\n\n1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.560\n Like if they wanted to keep Nakamoto consensus,\n\n1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:33.320\n proof of work, there's ways to enhance proof of work.\n\n1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:36.080\n I mean, Minkun Sir did this with BitcoinNG,\n\n1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:38.640\n Promotivus Wanus did this with Prism.\n\n1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:40.360\n Make it 10,000 times faster\n\n1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:43.040\n and you don't compromise the fundamental security assumptions\n\n1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:44.200\n that the system has.\n\n1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:46.080\n You can add programmability to it.\n\n1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:48.520\n Blockstream created a language called Simplicity.\n\n1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:50.520\n And so there's actual ways to extend.\n\n1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:53.360\n And we did this with Cardano with the extended UTXO model.\n\n1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:55.680\n There's ways to extend what Bitcoin has.\n\n1:33:55.680 --> 1:33:57.480\n Keep the philosophy, the accounting,\n\n1:33:57.480 --> 1:33:59.680\n the way of thinking about transactions.\n\n1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:02.480\n But then suddenly you can now do DeFi and other things.\n\n1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:03.560\n But what they've done is said,\n\n1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:06.240\n we will not evolve the base layer at all.\n\n1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:08.800\n And we're just gonna build all this layer two stuff,\n\n1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:11.680\n which is usually highly fragile and centralized\n\n1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:13.760\n and requires enormous effort at the base level\n\n1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:14.920\n to do anything.\n\n1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:17.880\n It's not a coincidence Vitalik started as a color coins guy\n\n1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:20.280\n and a master coin guy hanging out in those circles.\n\n1:34:20.280 --> 1:34:22.880\n He was trying to innovate and do things in Bitcoin.\n\n1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:24.920\n And it was so hard and difficult\n\n1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:27.240\n that he started diverging and going and doing things\n\n1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:29.120\n in a different system entirely.\n\n1:34:30.080 --> 1:34:31.560\n I knew the master coin guys,\n\n1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:33.720\n JR and all these people, they were maximalists.\n\n1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:35.480\n They really wanted to build something cool\n\n1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:36.600\n and exciting for Bitcoin.\n\n1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:39.280\n And anything they did, the developers would attack them.\n\n1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:42.000\n It's all you're misusing op return, you're doing this,\n\n1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.720\n that it was a holy war anytime you wanted to evolve.\n\n1:34:44.720 --> 1:34:46.760\n So I think it's its own worst enemy.\n\n1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:49.040\n It has the network effect, it has the brand name,\n\n1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:51.000\n it has the regulatory approval,\n\n1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.720\n but there's no way to change the system,\n\n1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:56.720\n even correcting obvious downsides in that system.\n\n1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:58.440\n Now, what's really cool is Ethereum\n\n1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:00.360\n doesn't suffer from that problem.\n\n1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:02.040\n It's getting to a point\n\n1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:04.240\n where it has a similar network effect to Bitcoin,\n\n1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:08.040\n but the community there is completely different in culture.\n\n1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:09.960\n They love evolving, they love upgrading,\n\n1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:11.600\n sometimes a little too much.\n\n1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:15.080\n And so that means that if you look at the trajectory\n\n1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:17.360\n of things, if I had to bet just those two systems,\n\n1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:20.560\n Bitcoin or Ethereum, I would say nine times out of 10,\n\n1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:23.400\n Ethereum is going to win the fight against Bitcoin\n\n1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:25.240\n if it was the only competitor.\n\n1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:27.600\n But obviously we're here and a lot of other people are here.\n\n1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:29.640\n So there's different things going on.\n\n1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:31.520\n So it's a much more complex game.\n\n1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:33.360\n But I think that's always a key,\n\n1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:36.640\n zooming out a little bit, set the technology aside\n\n1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.560\n and the word salad of cryptography aside\n\n1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:39.760\n because it's too much.\n\n1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:41.080\n What you have to always do is say,\n\n1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:44.040\n what incentive does the system have to evolve?\n\n1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:46.640\n And when you look at things like Android and the App Store\n\n1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.920\n and these analogous platforms,\n\n1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:51.120\n you say, ah, the evolution is user driven\n\n1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:52.360\n and there's a financial incentive\n\n1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:53.800\n for the user to participate.\n\n1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:56.200\n So if I had to look at the trajectory of this thing,\n\n1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:57.680\n come back 10 years later,\n\n1:35:57.680 --> 1:35:59.880\n it's probably gonna have millions of applications\n\n1:35:59.880 --> 1:36:01.720\n and lots of stuff going on\n\n1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:04.240\n because that's the way the system was constructed.\n\n1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:05.560\n Okay, it makes sense.\n\n1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:06.680\n When you look at Bitcoin, you say,\n\n1:36:06.680 --> 1:36:09.280\n what is the incentive to evolve the system?\n\n1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:10.520\n There's none.\n\n1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:12.360\n What is the incentive for the system\n\n1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:13.720\n to get more competitive?\n\n1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:14.560\n There's none.\n\n1:36:14.560 --> 1:36:15.400\n In fact, it's the opposite.\n\n1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:16.540\n They've turned it into a religion.\n\n1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:19.520\n I was in Miami at this Bitcoin conference there.\n\n1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:21.540\n I had a toilet paper roll thrown at me\n\n1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:23.100\n that had shit coin written on it.\n\n1:36:23.100 --> 1:36:25.520\n You have Max Keiser out on the stage,\n\n1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:28.320\n doing his best Rick James impression.\n\n1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.060\n We'll see the guy that did the F Elon, fuck Elon.\n\n1:36:32.060 --> 1:36:33.100\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n1:36:33.100 --> 1:36:35.500\n And so you're watching this stuff and you say,\n\n1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:37.820\n okay, first, why would anybody wanna join that?\n\n1:36:37.820 --> 1:36:40.540\n And then second, where is the conversation\n\n1:36:40.540 --> 1:36:42.580\n about how do we achieve something?\n\n1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:44.460\n I started with Cardano, the end in mind.\n\n1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:47.040\n I said, we really wanna sit down\n\n1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:49.000\n and build this financial operating system.\n\n1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:50.980\n And the definition of success is\n\n1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:52.340\n the poorest person in the world\n\n1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:53.920\n has access to the same system\n\n1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:55.500\n as the richest person in the world\n\n1:36:55.500 --> 1:36:57.740\n and they both get treated fairly.\n\n1:36:57.740 --> 1:36:59.220\n We've never had that happen before.\n\n1:36:59.220 --> 1:37:00.100\n Okay, that's something.\n\n1:37:00.100 --> 1:37:01.380\n You can agree with it, disagree with it,\n\n1:37:01.380 --> 1:37:03.220\n say it's boiling the ocean, it's impossible.\n\n1:37:03.220 --> 1:37:04.500\n At least I have something.\n\n1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:06.380\n I can't for the life of me understand\n\n1:37:06.380 --> 1:37:08.140\n what the hell is the point of Bitcoin.\n\n1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:11.160\n When I joined the Bitcoin space way back in the day,\n\n1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.060\n it was, hey, we hate the dollar.\n\n1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:14.920\n And hey, we like gold a lot.\n\n1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:15.980\n Let's create digital gold.\n\n1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:17.780\n Let's build a payment system.\n\n1:37:17.780 --> 1:37:20.060\n And then it just kind of went all these different directions\n\n1:37:20.060 --> 1:37:22.700\n and nobody can actually tell you what Bitcoin is for.\n\n1:37:22.700 --> 1:37:24.560\n It's a store of value, okay.\n\n1:37:25.820 --> 1:37:27.260\n There's some proof of work thing\n\n1:37:27.260 --> 1:37:29.700\n where maybe you're like incentivizing\n\n1:37:29.700 --> 1:37:30.980\n alternative energy to be produced.\n\n1:37:30.980 --> 1:37:32.340\n I don't know.\n\n1:37:32.340 --> 1:37:33.700\n Nobody really knows the philosophy.\n\n1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:35.100\n There's no direction.\n\n1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:38.340\n And they say, but don't worry, just buy and hold\n\n1:37:38.340 --> 1:37:40.340\n and everything will sort its way out.\n\n1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:41.380\n I believe it's HODL.\n\n1:37:41.380 --> 1:37:42.620\n Yeah, HODL.\n\n1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:44.460\n What about the idea of digital gold?\n\n1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:46.900\n So trying to replace that particular physical material\n\n1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:49.340\n that is gold to transfer into the digital space.\n\n1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:50.180\n That's something.\n\n1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:51.700\n Okay, let's do that then.\n\n1:37:51.700 --> 1:37:52.860\n And just say that's all it does.\n\n1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:54.140\n Then why are we doing lightning?\n\n1:37:54.140 --> 1:37:55.340\n Why are we doing any of these other things?\n\n1:37:55.340 --> 1:37:57.740\n You don't really need with a commodity,\n\n1:37:57.740 --> 1:38:00.100\n a digital commodity, high throughput.\n\n1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:01.340\n You can have slow settlement.\n\n1:38:01.340 --> 1:38:02.760\n You can have high transaction fees,\n\n1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:03.600\n all these types of things.\n\n1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:05.020\n And that's fine.\n\n1:38:05.020 --> 1:38:07.280\n Okay, that's something, pick it.\n\n1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:09.940\n Well, the idea is to try to come up with technology\n\n1:38:09.940 --> 1:38:11.300\n like the lightning network\n\n1:38:11.300 --> 1:38:13.620\n that could have something like gold,\n\n1:38:13.620 --> 1:38:16.060\n but then still build an economy around it.\n\n1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:18.020\n Something with a high throughput transactions.\n\n1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:21.100\n And have we ever built a successful banking credit system\n\n1:38:21.100 --> 1:38:22.340\n off of gold?\n\n1:38:22.340 --> 1:38:23.180\n Never.\n\n1:38:23.180 --> 1:38:25.500\n It never works because there's too much volatility\n\n1:38:25.500 --> 1:38:26.720\n in the underlying asset.\n\n1:38:26.720 --> 1:38:28.980\n Would you take a gold denominated loan for something?\n\n1:38:28.980 --> 1:38:29.820\n If somebody says, all right,\n\n1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:32.140\n I'll give you five bars of gold to go buy this car\n\n1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:35.040\n and pay me back five and a half bars of gold.\n\n1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:37.380\n Nobody would know in five years where they come out\n\n1:38:37.380 --> 1:38:38.220\n in that kind of a range.\n\n1:38:38.220 --> 1:38:39.620\n The idea is that the gold is used\n\n1:38:39.620 --> 1:38:41.240\n for the settlement of transactions\n\n1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:42.700\n and then you're operating,\n\n1:38:42.700 --> 1:38:45.940\n the actual economy is operating outside of gold.\n\n1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:48.220\n And then you kind of connect back to gold.\n\n1:38:48.220 --> 1:38:49.860\n So we had to go back to the gold reserve\n\n1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:51.900\n and we tried that for a long time.\n\n1:38:51.900 --> 1:38:53.780\n It didn't really work in a modern global economy.\n\n1:38:53.780 --> 1:38:55.900\n We had the Brentwood's agreement and all these other things.\n\n1:38:55.900 --> 1:38:57.860\n And so I understand what you're saying\n\n1:38:57.860 --> 1:38:59.920\n and maybe there's some merit to that,\n\n1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:02.180\n but if that was really an earnest where they want to go,\n\n1:39:02.180 --> 1:39:03.900\n then the conversation should be about,\n\n1:39:03.900 --> 1:39:06.420\n well, how do we make it easy for layer two protocols\n\n1:39:06.420 --> 1:39:08.140\n to interact with Bitcoin?\n\n1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:10.260\n So why is simplicity not built into it?\n\n1:39:10.260 --> 1:39:12.180\n Why is it taking so long to do SnoreSigs?\n\n1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:14.940\n Why is it taking so long to do all these obvious upgrades,\n\n1:39:14.940 --> 1:39:17.220\n which are cryptographically low danger?\n\n1:39:17.220 --> 1:39:20.260\n Also NipaPals, not interactive proofs of proof of work.\n\n1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:21.860\n There's no cost to doing that.\n\n1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:23.660\n It's just a property of proof of work\n\n1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:26.940\n where certain puzzles are more special than other puzzles.\n\n1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:29.700\n And by noticing that you can create these beautiful proofs\n\n1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:32.020\n that allow you to have side chains and like clients.\n\n1:39:32.020 --> 1:39:34.140\n It's not compromising security of the system.\n\n1:39:34.140 --> 1:39:36.540\n It's just something you get for free with proof of work.\n\n1:39:36.540 --> 1:39:38.100\n Those came out in 2016.\n\n1:39:38.100 --> 1:39:40.260\n There's derivative work fly client floating around.\n\n1:39:40.260 --> 1:39:41.740\n Where the hell is it?\n\n1:39:41.740 --> 1:39:43.780\n This is the frustration that I have is like,\n\n1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:45.860\n if you really are serious about this whole lightning\n\n1:39:45.860 --> 1:39:48.700\n and gold economy thing, I love choice.\n\n1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:50.060\n I'm a libertarian by nature.\n\n1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:51.540\n I love competition.\n\n1:39:51.540 --> 1:39:53.060\n And I read all those books.\n\n1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:56.140\n I read Ludwig von Mises's work and Murray Rothbard's work.\n\n1:39:56.140 --> 1:39:58.660\n I love what Hayek had to say about private currencies.\n\n1:39:58.660 --> 1:39:59.700\n Let's go try it.\n\n1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:00.540\n That's great.\n\n1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:03.140\n But then you have to have some focus and commitment\n\n1:40:03.140 --> 1:40:04.140\n as an ecosystem.\n\n1:40:04.140 --> 1:40:07.100\n And the excuse they use is, well, no, we don't\n\n1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:08.340\n because we're decentralized.\n\n1:40:08.340 --> 1:40:11.380\n And because we're decentralized, we don't need that.\n\n1:40:11.380 --> 1:40:14.060\n As if there's some sort of guiding swarm intelligence\n\n1:40:14.060 --> 1:40:16.220\n that will naturally push the system\n\n1:40:16.220 --> 1:40:17.940\n in that particular direction.\n\n1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:19.100\n But then you ask, well,\n\n1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:21.620\n how do people measure the success of Bitcoin?\n\n1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:23.700\n Is it the fact that they've actually achieved\n\n1:40:23.700 --> 1:40:27.700\n lots of transactions and lots of actual economic activity\n\n1:40:27.700 --> 1:40:29.380\n and lots of businesses accepting Bitcoin?\n\n1:40:29.380 --> 1:40:30.380\n That will go up.\n\n1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:31.980\n It's the price.\n\n1:40:31.980 --> 1:40:33.180\n That's what they do.\n\n1:40:33.180 --> 1:40:34.780\n And that's the only thing they pay attention.\n\n1:40:34.780 --> 1:40:37.100\n That's why this is the most attended Bitcoin conference\n\n1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:37.940\n in history.\n\n1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:40.540\n Not because somehow Bitcoin got so much more adoption,\n\n1:40:40.540 --> 1:40:43.260\n it's because this is the highest price point Bitcoin\n\n1:40:43.260 --> 1:40:46.020\n has ever been this year, over 30,000.\n\n1:40:46.020 --> 1:40:47.780\n So first of all, let me state that, Charles,\n\n1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:51.420\n for the most part is purely objective.\n\n1:40:51.420 --> 1:40:55.340\n The bias that comes in, for the record, I want to say,\n\n1:40:55.340 --> 1:40:58.060\n that I have heard, because you mentioned the mafia,\n\n1:40:58.060 --> 1:41:00.860\n that you prefer Goodfellas over the Godfather.\n\n1:41:00.860 --> 1:41:04.380\n So a man who prefers Goodfellas over Godfather,\n\n1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:07.980\n you take it for that opinion for what it is.\n\n1:41:09.580 --> 1:41:11.900\n I actually had to think about that one for quite a bit.\n\n1:41:11.900 --> 1:41:12.740\n I think.\n\n1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:13.580\n Oh, come on.\n\n1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:14.420\n Joe Pesci was so good in that movie.\n\n1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:15.260\n He's incredible.\n\n1:41:15.260 --> 1:41:18.260\n I also love Casino and those big glasses on De Niro.\n\n1:41:18.260 --> 1:41:19.460\n I love it.\n\n1:41:19.460 --> 1:41:20.460\n With Sharon Stone.\n\n1:41:20.460 --> 1:41:21.980\n But we could talk about that for hours.\n\n1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:23.980\n But let me ask you about the Bitcoin conference,\n\n1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:27.540\n because it is kind of, I would say,\n\n1:41:27.540 --> 1:41:29.380\n an important moment in human history.\n\n1:41:29.380 --> 1:41:31.540\n It was quite exciting in terms of size\n\n1:41:31.540 --> 1:41:35.180\n and kind of turmoil and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:41:35.180 --> 1:41:37.340\n And you were there in, what is it?\n\n1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:39.220\n Hot and humid Miami.\n\n1:41:39.220 --> 1:41:41.460\n I believe that's the way you introduced it.\n\n1:41:41.460 --> 1:41:46.220\n So what do you make of the community of Bitcoin\n\n1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:49.140\n or that particular event in human history?\n\n1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:51.700\n What makes me sad is I remember the old Bitcoin community\n\n1:41:51.700 --> 1:41:53.180\n and I've seen what it's become.\n\n1:41:53.180 --> 1:41:54.940\n And the old community was really fun,\n\n1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:57.140\n like the San Jose conference in 2013\n\n1:41:57.140 --> 1:41:59.340\n or subsequent conferences.\n\n1:41:59.340 --> 1:42:00.980\n You know, there was just a lot of people,\n\n1:42:00.980 --> 1:42:04.700\n they had no money and they just really loved this idea\n\n1:42:04.700 --> 1:42:05.940\n of decentralized money.\n\n1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:09.180\n They loved this idea of decentralization in particular.\n\n1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:11.740\n And you could strike up a conversation with everyone.\n\n1:42:11.740 --> 1:42:13.420\n There's no ego at all.\n\n1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.780\n But what was really fun is you could really get\n\n1:42:16.780 --> 1:42:18.860\n intimate friendships and relationships,\n\n1:42:18.860 --> 1:42:21.740\n great conversations with people there.\n\n1:42:21.740 --> 1:42:23.260\n It's kind of like the early days of AI.\n\n1:42:23.260 --> 1:42:25.060\n They all met in Dartmouth and all these other places.\n\n1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:26.420\n Very intimate, there was no egos.\n\n1:42:26.420 --> 1:42:28.660\n Everybody was just trying to do some really cool stuff.\n\n1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:30.740\n Now, just like those early days,\n\n1:42:30.740 --> 1:42:33.460\n there was an overestimate of how robust\n\n1:42:33.460 --> 1:42:34.420\n the solutions would be.\n\n1:42:34.420 --> 1:42:36.660\n So we believed, oh yeah, 10 years,\n\n1:42:36.660 --> 1:42:38.620\n we're gonna rule the whole world, right?\n\n1:42:38.620 --> 1:42:39.660\n Didn't exactly happen.\n\n1:42:39.660 --> 1:42:42.460\n On the other hand, Bitcoin grew from nothing\n\n1:42:42.460 --> 1:42:46.580\n in just 11 years to I'm in Mongolia riding camels\n\n1:42:46.580 --> 1:42:50.100\n and the camel herder has Bitcoin in the Coby desert.\n\n1:42:50.100 --> 1:42:52.580\n So that's telling you that's a pretty pervasive technology\n\n1:42:52.580 --> 1:42:54.780\n if you have that level of adoption that quickly.\n\n1:42:54.780 --> 1:42:57.700\n When I went to Miami, it was unrecognizable.\n\n1:42:57.700 --> 1:42:59.020\n Everything was so commercial.\n\n1:42:59.020 --> 1:43:04.020\n Half of the vendors at the conference were like watches\n\n1:43:04.340 --> 1:43:06.260\n that cost half a million dollars\n\n1:43:06.260 --> 1:43:07.900\n and they were covered in diamonds.\n\n1:43:07.900 --> 1:43:10.460\n So when you see that kind of materialism leak its way in,\n\n1:43:10.460 --> 1:43:12.100\n it's first is repulsive.\n\n1:43:12.100 --> 1:43:14.340\n The other thing was there was no,\n\n1:43:14.340 --> 1:43:16.260\n like I remember one of the first conferences,\n\n1:43:16.260 --> 1:43:19.100\n Mo Levin's conference in January of 2014,\n\n1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:22.140\n the North American Bitcoin Conference ironically in Miami,\n\n1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:24.980\n there was a Bitcoin help center booth.\n\n1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:27.700\n Dima ran it and a few of the other Bitcoin OGs ran it.\n\n1:43:27.700 --> 1:43:29.780\n The core developers actually came over like Jeff\n\n1:43:29.780 --> 1:43:32.020\n and others who were there and sat at the booth\n\n1:43:32.020 --> 1:43:34.020\n and anybody come up, ask a question,\n\n1:43:34.020 --> 1:43:35.620\n anything you wanna ask about Bitcoin.\n\n1:43:35.620 --> 1:43:36.900\n It was like, that was the culture,\n\n1:43:36.900 --> 1:43:38.660\n just help people welcome in.\n\n1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:40.820\n There was no help booth there.\n\n1:43:40.820 --> 1:43:42.060\n There was no notion of that.\n\n1:43:42.060 --> 1:43:44.660\n There were six hour lines and superstars\n\n1:43:44.660 --> 1:43:45.500\n and things like that.\n\n1:43:45.500 --> 1:43:47.580\n And again, again, it was always the same thing.\n\n1:43:47.580 --> 1:43:50.740\n Look how much money all these people have made.\n\n1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:52.020\n And the whole point of Bitcoin\n\n1:43:52.020 --> 1:43:53.980\n was to redefine the notion of money,\n\n1:43:53.980 --> 1:43:57.220\n redefine the notion of value, these types of things.\n\n1:43:57.220 --> 1:43:59.660\n So it just, I'm no longer part of that.\n\n1:43:59.660 --> 1:44:02.820\n And it made me sad because I really enjoyed being part of it.\n\n1:44:02.820 --> 1:44:04.900\n How I got started was the Bitcoin education project.\n\n1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:06.020\n I did a class on Udemy.\n\n1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:07.100\n I gave it away for free.\n\n1:44:07.100 --> 1:44:09.940\n I had 80,000 students and they would email me.\n\n1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:13.020\n I got 5,000 emails before I stopped answering them.\n\n1:44:13.020 --> 1:44:15.780\n And everyone come in and ask me some question\n\n1:44:15.780 --> 1:44:18.780\n about something, sometimes arcane, sometimes trivial.\n\n1:44:18.780 --> 1:44:21.260\n And I take the time to sit down and answer the question\n\n1:44:21.260 --> 1:44:22.900\n or forward the email to somebody I knew\n\n1:44:22.900 --> 1:44:24.940\n who could answer that particular type of question.\n\n1:44:24.940 --> 1:44:27.140\n And there were some amazing people in the early days\n\n1:44:27.140 --> 1:44:29.180\n like Mike Hearn and Gavin and others.\n\n1:44:29.180 --> 1:44:31.540\n And they were just super committed.\n\n1:44:31.540 --> 1:44:33.580\n And Mike's case, he knew Satoshi.\n\n1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:35.340\n He actually emailed them back and forth\n\n1:44:35.340 --> 1:44:37.620\n because he was around 2009, 2010.\n\n1:44:37.620 --> 1:44:39.740\n He did the Bitcoin Java client.\n\n1:44:39.740 --> 1:44:40.740\n And Satoshi was all excited.\n\n1:44:40.740 --> 1:44:43.180\n He said, oh, wow, Bitcoin can come to a cell phone.\n\n1:44:43.180 --> 1:44:45.540\n This is really cool and exciting.\n\n1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:46.380\n And then what happened?\n\n1:44:46.380 --> 1:44:48.740\n Mike left Bitcoin in 2013\n\n1:44:48.740 --> 1:44:51.380\n over the whole big block debate that happened.\n\n1:44:51.380 --> 1:44:53.100\n They just treated him like dirt,\n\n1:44:53.100 --> 1:44:54.940\n like he was subhuman or something.\n\n1:44:54.940 --> 1:44:56.780\n So I don't know, the culture has changed a lot.\n\n1:44:56.780 --> 1:44:59.900\n And if they like it, it's good for them.\n\n1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:02.860\n They can enjoy their religion, but it's not for me.\n\n1:45:02.860 --> 1:45:05.820\n And where I like being is, like I had a guy\n\n1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:08.260\n who used to work for me, Alex Cherpanoi,\n\n1:45:08.260 --> 1:45:10.380\n and he created this beautiful project called Ergo.\n\n1:45:10.380 --> 1:45:13.500\n To me, that is the spiritual successor to Bitcoin.\n\n1:45:13.500 --> 1:45:15.940\n Ergo is really special because it has the same culture.\n\n1:45:15.940 --> 1:45:17.380\n It has the same mentality.\n\n1:45:17.380 --> 1:45:20.380\n And the technology is kind of like a natural evolution\n\n1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:22.780\n of what you would do if you knew about Bitcoin\n\n1:45:22.780 --> 1:45:24.740\n and you wanted to build the next big thing.\n\n1:45:24.740 --> 1:45:26.380\n So it's still a proof of work system.\n\n1:45:26.380 --> 1:45:28.060\n It's still a UTXO system,\n\n1:45:28.060 --> 1:45:30.460\n but he added UTXO with some smart contracts.\n\n1:45:30.460 --> 1:45:32.500\n It's this Sigma protocol idea.\n\n1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:33.780\n On the proof of work side,\n\n1:45:33.780 --> 1:45:36.260\n Satoshi had this one CPU, one vote idea.\n\n1:45:36.260 --> 1:45:38.580\n So Alex tried to create non outsourceable puzzles\n\n1:45:38.580 --> 1:45:40.860\n to make it impossible to have mining pools.\n\n1:45:40.860 --> 1:45:42.380\n And there's all these other beautiful little things.\n\n1:45:42.380 --> 1:45:45.300\n And he's this brilliant Russian programmer,\n\n1:45:45.300 --> 1:45:46.260\n and he surrounded himself\n\n1:45:46.260 --> 1:45:47.660\n with all these other brilliant people.\n\n1:45:47.660 --> 1:45:48.860\n He has zero ego.\n\n1:45:48.860 --> 1:45:50.300\n He has negative ego.\n\n1:45:50.300 --> 1:45:51.700\n When you put him with a person with ego,\n\n1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:53.900\n your ego goes down, right?\n\n1:45:53.900 --> 1:45:56.220\n And everything about Alex is always like,\n\n1:45:56.220 --> 1:45:57.100\n how do I solve this?\n\n1:45:57.100 --> 1:45:57.980\n How do I do that?\n\n1:45:57.980 --> 1:46:00.840\n And he gets legitimately excited when he meets somebody\n\n1:46:00.840 --> 1:46:04.060\n that he can collaborate with or learn from.\n\n1:46:04.060 --> 1:46:06.580\n That's where Bitcoin was in the beginning.\n\n1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:08.520\n Everybody set their egos aside,\n\n1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:10.240\n whether it was Hal Finney or whatever,\n\n1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:11.860\n and they would just say, how can I help?\n\n1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:12.700\n What can I do?\n\n1:46:12.700 --> 1:46:14.940\n And it was all about coming up with some cool new thing\n\n1:46:14.940 --> 1:46:17.260\n or solving some cool new problem.\n\n1:46:17.260 --> 1:46:19.140\n I don't see any of that in Bitcoin today.\n\n1:46:19.140 --> 1:46:20.940\n So quite a few people are excited about Ergo\n\n1:46:20.940 --> 1:46:21.900\n and excited about the fact\n\n1:46:21.900 --> 1:46:25.080\n that you kind of appreciate Alex and Ergo.\n\n1:46:25.080 --> 1:46:28.140\n Do you see Cardano potentially utilizing\n\n1:46:28.140 --> 1:46:30.220\n the proof of work mechanism from Ergo\n\n1:46:30.220 --> 1:46:35.220\n as part of this pool for the consensus mechanism?\n\n1:46:35.260 --> 1:46:36.420\n I mean, anything's possible,\n\n1:46:36.420 --> 1:46:39.220\n and there's a lot of evolution Ergo has to go through.\n\n1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:41.300\n And Ergo, it was kind of like,\n\n1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:43.620\n when the Xbox 360 first came out,\n\n1:46:43.620 --> 1:46:44.980\n while they were prototyping it,\n\n1:46:44.980 --> 1:46:46.900\n Microsoft needed a development environment.\n\n1:46:46.900 --> 1:46:49.760\n They ironically purchased a lot of Apple computers\n\n1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:50.600\n to do that,\n\n1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:52.740\n because Apple was moving away from the PowerPC to Intel,\n\n1:46:52.740 --> 1:46:54.900\n and Microsoft was moving towards the PowerPC,\n\n1:46:54.900 --> 1:46:56.620\n just this weird intersection of history.\n\n1:46:56.620 --> 1:46:57.460\n So at that time,\n\n1:46:57.460 --> 1:46:59.400\n the largest order of Mac computers made\n\n1:46:59.400 --> 1:47:01.020\n was done by Microsoft,\n\n1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:02.660\n and they were using it for Xbox stuff.\n\n1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:04.260\n So Ergo, we viewed the same way.\n\n1:47:04.260 --> 1:47:06.780\n So we said, well, we have this extended UTXO model.\n\n1:47:06.780 --> 1:47:09.500\n The only thing that's sufficiently close to it\n\n1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:12.900\n where we can beta test contracts is actually with Ergo.\n\n1:47:12.900 --> 1:47:15.220\n And Alex just was a little faster\n\n1:47:15.220 --> 1:47:16.340\n in getting certain things out,\n\n1:47:16.340 --> 1:47:17.380\n because we were doing things\n\n1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:18.780\n in a slightly more rigorous way\n\n1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:20.520\n and slightly more expressive way.\n\n1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:22.740\n So we actually tested a stable coin and Oracle\n\n1:47:22.740 --> 1:47:24.020\n and other things on Ergo,\n\n1:47:24.020 --> 1:47:26.740\n and it has just incredible community.\n\n1:47:26.740 --> 1:47:29.060\n When we said, hey, we're coming here to work and build,\n\n1:47:29.060 --> 1:47:30.780\n he said, oh yeah, we'd love to work with you guys.\n\n1:47:30.780 --> 1:47:32.300\n This is so cool.\n\n1:47:32.300 --> 1:47:33.980\n The other thing is Alex used to work for us,\n\n1:47:33.980 --> 1:47:36.300\n and he had this lovely project called Scorex,\n\n1:47:36.300 --> 1:47:39.100\n and it was all about like a pedagogical framework\n\n1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:40.540\n for building blockchains.\n\n1:47:40.540 --> 1:47:42.740\n And if you want to do prototyping or academic research,\n\n1:47:42.740 --> 1:47:43.580\n it was great.\n\n1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:44.540\n It was super modular,\n\n1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:46.260\n and it separated the consensus network\n\n1:47:46.260 --> 1:47:48.380\n and transaction layer from each other\n\n1:47:48.380 --> 1:47:49.700\n in just the right way,\n\n1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:52.180\n so that you can make it modular and mix and match things.\n\n1:47:52.180 --> 1:47:53.500\n So you can put secure academia in,\n\n1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:54.900\n or maybe a different network layer\n\n1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:56.780\n and a different consensus protocol,\n\n1:47:56.780 --> 1:47:59.340\n a proof of work to another proof of work and so forth.\n\n1:47:59.340 --> 1:48:02.500\n So we loved having that kind of IP sitting around\n\n1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:03.820\n because it gave us the ability\n\n1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:06.340\n to kind of play around with ideas in a matter of weeks\n\n1:48:06.340 --> 1:48:07.540\n instead of months or years.\n\n1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:10.500\n And then he just took that concept and he gave it away.\n\n1:48:10.500 --> 1:48:12.700\n The wave protocol was built on it.\n\n1:48:12.700 --> 1:48:15.140\n That was Sasha Ivanov, he did that.\n\n1:48:15.140 --> 1:48:17.380\n And I think there's two or three other cryptocurrencies\n\n1:48:17.380 --> 1:48:18.420\n that were launched from Scorex,\n\n1:48:18.420 --> 1:48:22.040\n and then Alex took that and built Ergo from it.\n\n1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:23.620\n So there was a nice intersection\n\n1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:25.500\n where there was overlapping technology\n\n1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:27.620\n with Ergo with our technology.\n\n1:48:27.620 --> 1:48:29.020\n And the other thing was that the community\n\n1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:31.380\n was so open and friendly, it was just a no brainer.\n\n1:48:31.380 --> 1:48:33.840\n Just go in and start building some things there.\n\n1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:35.700\n Now, in terms of evolving ideas,\n\n1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:38.020\n the whole Sigma protocol idea is very different\n\n1:48:38.020 --> 1:48:39.100\n and it's very interesting.\n\n1:48:39.100 --> 1:48:42.100\n And there's a guy at Boston University,\n\n1:48:42.100 --> 1:48:43.740\n his name will come to me in a second,\n\n1:48:43.740 --> 1:48:46.100\n who came up with this stuff.\n\n1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:48.100\n And I think there's some merit there,\n\n1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:51.260\n especially as we start moving closer to this idea\n\n1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:53.500\n of blockchains being used to validate proofs\n\n1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:54.700\n instead of running computations.\n\n1:48:54.700 --> 1:48:56.180\n What's the Sigma protocol, by the way?\n\n1:48:56.180 --> 1:48:58.840\n So it's just a way of expressing scripts.\n\n1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:03.220\n And basically, you get these concise representations\n\n1:49:03.220 --> 1:49:05.020\n of proofs, and then you can say,\n\n1:49:05.020 --> 1:49:06.100\n okay, the script is correct,\n\n1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:07.820\n but you don't have to run the whole program.\n\n1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:10.180\n So there's a lot, I'm not doing the topic justice,\n\n1:49:10.180 --> 1:49:12.900\n there's a lot more to it, but that's the basic concept.\n\n1:49:12.900 --> 1:49:14.900\n And in a Redeemer validator model,\n\n1:49:14.900 --> 1:49:15.980\n you need stuff like that,\n\n1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:19.000\n because as your model gets more complex\n\n1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:20.940\n and a lot more things happen,\n\n1:49:20.940 --> 1:49:22.740\n you don't want to have a situation\n\n1:49:22.740 --> 1:49:27.260\n where I have to run, replay a huge amount of the UTXO graph\n\n1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:28.540\n to be able to get to a point\n\n1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:30.020\n where I have the state of the system.\n\n1:49:30.020 --> 1:49:32.100\n You need some mathematical artifact\n\n1:49:32.100 --> 1:49:34.180\n that gives you the state of the system quickly.\n\n1:49:34.180 --> 1:49:35.980\n And then you're saying, okay, I now know\n\n1:49:35.980 --> 1:49:37.780\n what computation thread I need to run\n\n1:49:37.780 --> 1:49:39.020\n to be able to get enough\n\n1:49:39.020 --> 1:49:41.400\n to be able to redeem this transaction.\n\n1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:43.620\n So he just found a more compressed representation of it,\n\n1:49:43.620 --> 1:49:45.460\n and the math doesn't matter.\n\n1:49:45.460 --> 1:49:49.060\n What matters is there's a whole beautiful field\n\n1:49:49.060 --> 1:49:51.180\n that thinks about this type of stuff,\n\n1:49:51.180 --> 1:49:55.140\n and it was never once linked before into our industry.\n\n1:49:55.140 --> 1:49:57.140\n The brilliance of Alex was to actually realize\n\n1:49:57.140 --> 1:49:59.620\n you could do that and pull those things together,\n\n1:49:59.620 --> 1:50:01.340\n and it may actually have some merit,\n\n1:50:01.340 --> 1:50:03.820\n but by no means is he the only guy that does this stuff.\n\n1:50:03.820 --> 1:50:07.740\n There's actually other approaches in verified computing\n\n1:50:07.740 --> 1:50:08.920\n that have explored that.\n\n1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:10.860\n Like my favorite came out of Microsoft research\n\n1:50:10.860 --> 1:50:12.260\n is a project called Pinocchio,\n\n1:50:12.260 --> 1:50:13.860\n and there was a followup called Geppetto.\n\n1:50:13.860 --> 1:50:17.460\n And the basic idea was that it's fortuitous\n\n1:50:17.460 --> 1:50:19.820\n that you have these computer science problems\n\n1:50:19.820 --> 1:50:24.820\n like hashing where you can do all this computation,\n\n1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:27.340\n and once you've done all of it,\n\n1:50:27.340 --> 1:50:28.500\n and you've found this magic number\n\n1:50:28.500 --> 1:50:31.660\n that you can verify that the computation was done correctly.\n\n1:50:31.660 --> 1:50:33.220\n So the proof of work works this way.\n\n1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:34.520\n Hard to do the proof of work,\n\n1:50:34.520 --> 1:50:36.240\n easy to check the proof of work.\n\n1:50:37.100 --> 1:50:38.620\n Cryptography also works this way.\n\n1:50:38.620 --> 1:50:39.700\n You have some trap door\n\n1:50:39.700 --> 1:50:41.200\n where you can verify something's correct,\n\n1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:43.500\n but to get that thing done,\n\n1:50:43.500 --> 1:50:44.780\n if you're doing it brute force,\n\n1:50:44.780 --> 1:50:46.740\n it takes an enormous amount of computation.\n\n1:50:46.740 --> 1:50:48.340\n Well, not all problems are like this,\n\n1:50:48.340 --> 1:50:50.540\n like protein folding, to verify the protein\n\n1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:52.340\n is folded correctly, you have to fold the protein.\n\n1:50:52.340 --> 1:50:53.880\n So you have to redo the work.\n\n1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:56.640\n But what if for arbitrary computation,\n\n1:50:56.640 --> 1:50:58.220\n you could take a problem,\n\n1:50:58.220 --> 1:50:59.740\n and then you could generate a proof\n\n1:50:59.740 --> 1:51:01.940\n that you've done that computation correctly,\n\n1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:04.180\n and the proof validates in logarithmic time\n\n1:51:04.180 --> 1:51:05.200\n or constant time.\n\n1:51:05.200 --> 1:51:06.980\n Wow, that's incredible, right?\n\n1:51:06.980 --> 1:51:09.260\n Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that.\n\n1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:10.360\n It's called Pinocchio.\n\n1:51:10.360 --> 1:51:12.260\n So that's another example of these types of things,\n\n1:51:12.260 --> 1:51:13.460\n these rollups of things\n\n1:51:13.460 --> 1:51:15.980\n where instead of doing the computation on chain\n\n1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:17.980\n or trying to create some sort of replicated machine\n\n1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:19.620\n that does all this stuff,\n\n1:51:19.620 --> 1:51:20.460\n you instead just say,\n\n1:51:20.460 --> 1:51:22.440\n okay, only thing I'm gonna use the blockchain for\n\n1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:24.160\n is to check your proof.\n\n1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:26.100\n But I'm gonna turn it into a distributed computing problem,\n\n1:51:26.100 --> 1:51:28.820\n and any person in the world can do the problem\n\n1:51:28.820 --> 1:51:31.360\n on any server, untrusted server even,\n\n1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.400\n because you don't have to trust the output,\n\n1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:36.380\n you trust the proof, and the proof is deterministic.\n\n1:51:36.380 --> 1:51:37.640\n It tells you these things.\n\n1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.680\n So whether you're using zero knowledge\n\n1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:41.940\n or Sigma protocols or some other mechanism,\n\n1:51:41.940 --> 1:51:44.220\n it's moving you in that particular direction\n\n1:51:44.220 --> 1:51:47.220\n to turn it from a replicated to a distributed problem\n\n1:51:47.220 --> 1:51:49.260\n and go from I'm doing the work to I'm checking\n\n1:51:49.260 --> 1:51:50.100\n that the work was done correctly.\n\n1:51:50.100 --> 1:51:50.940\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:51:50.940 --> 1:51:54.780\n And all of a sudden, we're back to the P equals NP thing\n\n1:51:54.780 --> 1:51:57.260\n where for many very interesting problems,\n\n1:51:57.260 --> 1:51:59.780\n the checking is efficient,\n\n1:51:59.780 --> 1:52:01.660\n is much more efficient than the solving.\n\n1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:04.020\n Right, and also do you want complete determinism\n\n1:52:04.020 --> 1:52:05.780\n or is it probabilistic?\n\n1:52:05.780 --> 1:52:07.700\n Because if you relax that requirement a little bit,\n\n1:52:07.700 --> 1:52:10.440\n then suddenly actually you have a broader class of things\n\n1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:12.300\n you can construct this stuff for.\n\n1:52:12.300 --> 1:52:14.140\n You mentioned UTXO.\n\n1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:18.120\n There's a paper titled the Extended UTXO Model.\n\n1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:20.380\n It writes in the introduction,\n\n1:52:20.380 --> 1:52:23.660\n Bitcoin and Ethereum hosting the two currently most valuable\n\n1:52:23.660 --> 1:52:25.280\n and popular cryptocurrencies\n\n1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:28.020\n use two rather different ledger models\n\n1:52:28.020 --> 1:52:33.020\n known as the UTXO model and the account model respectively.\n\n1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.740\n At the same time, these two public blockchains\n\n1:52:35.740 --> 1:52:37.620\n differ strongly in the expressiveness\n\n1:52:37.620 --> 1:52:41.120\n of the smart contracts that they support.\n\n1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:42.340\n This is no coincidence.\n\n1:52:42.340 --> 1:52:44.420\n Ethereum chose the account model\n\n1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:47.640\n explicitly to facilitate more expressive smart contracts.\n\n1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:51.100\n On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO also for good reasons,\n\n1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:54.340\n including that its semantic model stays simple\n\n1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:55.460\n in a complex concurrent\n\n1:52:55.460 --> 1:52:57.240\n and distributed computing environment.\n\n1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:59.820\n This raises the question of whether it is possible\n\n1:52:59.820 --> 1:53:01.500\n to have expressive smart contracts\n\n1:53:01.500 --> 1:53:05.340\n while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model.\n\n1:53:06.220 --> 1:53:07.060\n Okay.\n\n1:53:07.060 --> 1:53:08.580\n So what's the fuck that mean?\n\n1:53:08.580 --> 1:53:09.860\n Exactly.\n\n1:53:09.860 --> 1:53:13.140\n What is UTXO, what is the account model,\n\n1:53:13.140 --> 1:53:17.700\n and what is the idea of the Extended UTXO model?\n\n1:53:17.700 --> 1:53:19.540\n So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it\n\n1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:22.740\n is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting.\n\n1:53:22.740 --> 1:53:24.980\n So let's assume you don't have credit cards,\n\n1:53:24.980 --> 1:53:25.980\n you just have cash.\n\n1:53:25.980 --> 1:53:28.580\n And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes\n\n1:53:28.580 --> 1:53:30.340\n or whatever and you go to the cashier,\n\n1:53:30.340 --> 1:53:33.260\n you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them,\n\n1:53:33.260 --> 1:53:36.500\n unless it comes up to 17.50, they have to make change.\n\n1:53:36.500 --> 1:53:39.620\n So you don't tear your $20 bill,\n\n1:53:39.620 --> 1:53:42.260\n cut a piece of it off and say, here's part of my 20.\n\n1:53:42.260 --> 1:53:44.820\n You give them the entire $20 bill\n\n1:53:44.820 --> 1:53:46.700\n and then they give you something back.\n\n1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:48.020\n And the things that they give you back\n\n1:53:48.020 --> 1:53:50.980\n are also atomic units, they don't cut those things up.\n\n1:53:50.980 --> 1:53:53.940\n So that's kind of what UTXO is all about in a nutshell\n\n1:53:53.940 --> 1:53:55.420\n is that there's inputs and outputs,\n\n1:53:55.420 --> 1:53:57.980\n your inputs that 20 and your outputs will be\n\n1:53:57.980 --> 1:53:59.940\n the 17.50 that goes to them\n\n1:53:59.940 --> 1:54:03.740\n and then the remaining change that goes back to you, okay?\n\n1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:05.500\n The problem with this particular model\n\n1:54:05.500 --> 1:54:08.180\n is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin,\n\n1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:12.900\n there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates,\n\n1:54:12.900 --> 1:54:15.540\n complex contracts on this thing,\n\n1:54:15.540 --> 1:54:17.460\n where instead of just saying, okay,\n\n1:54:17.460 --> 1:54:19.180\n I'm just gonna push value to you,\n\n1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:21.260\n I wanna put lots of terms and conditions\n\n1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:22.860\n into the movement of that value.\n\n1:54:22.860 --> 1:54:26.020\n Like you only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday\n\n1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:29.620\n or you only get this if some event happens\n\n1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:32.540\n like the Broncos win the Super Bowl or something like that.\n\n1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:35.460\n Okay, so you need some notion of programmability with it.\n\n1:54:35.460 --> 1:54:37.460\n So a lot of people are trying to figure out\n\n1:54:37.460 --> 1:54:38.900\n in the early days of Bitcoin,\n\n1:54:38.900 --> 1:54:41.820\n how could we improve the expressiveness of the system?\n\n1:54:41.820 --> 1:54:44.100\n And one of ways of doing it is you can go\n\n1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:48.260\n to a different accounting model, bank style accounting.\n\n1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:51.260\n So in a bank ledger, every time you do a withdrawal,\n\n1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:54.300\n a deposit, it's a mutable system.\n\n1:54:54.300 --> 1:54:55.900\n With the cash register accounting,\n\n1:54:55.900 --> 1:54:57.100\n you don't tear up the bills,\n\n1:54:57.100 --> 1:55:00.260\n but the bank you can deduct or add ledger all the time.\n\n1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:02.780\n So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system\n\n1:55:02.780 --> 1:55:05.780\n where you just, you send messages, you send transactions\n\n1:55:05.780 --> 1:55:07.180\n and you're going up or down.\n\n1:55:07.180 --> 1:55:10.260\n And so you can trigger programs the same way.\n\n1:55:10.260 --> 1:55:12.220\n So what we did is we said, okay,\n\n1:55:12.220 --> 1:55:15.620\n if you take the UTXO model and you have some data to it,\n\n1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:17.940\n and instead of saying it's just a digital signature,\n\n1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:22.300\n but it's in a script, you can basically create something\n\n1:55:22.300 --> 1:55:24.620\n that's still the same as cash register,\n\n1:55:24.620 --> 1:55:26.020\n but now you have programmability\n\n1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:28.900\n and the big difference is local versus global.\n\n1:55:28.900 --> 1:55:32.620\n So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns.\n\n1:55:32.620 --> 1:55:34.820\n So whatever's going on in that cash register\n\n1:55:34.820 --> 1:55:37.900\n has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers.\n\n1:55:37.900 --> 1:55:39.540\n But when you look at bank accounting,\n\n1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:42.020\n you have to know the state of the entire banking world\n\n1:55:42.020 --> 1:55:43.180\n to be able to make that work.\n\n1:55:43.180 --> 1:55:44.020\n Why?\n\n1:55:44.020 --> 1:55:45.460\n Because if that transaction is inbound,\n\n1:55:45.460 --> 1:55:46.700\n that wire transfer is inbound,\n\n1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:48.220\n you have to know those funds are actually there,\n\n1:55:48.220 --> 1:55:50.060\n that thing is actually happening.\n\n1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:52.340\n So when you have a global state for a program,\n\n1:55:52.340 --> 1:55:54.220\n it's like you could do a lot more with it,\n\n1:55:54.220 --> 1:55:55.380\n but it's a lot more dangerous.\n\n1:55:55.380 --> 1:55:57.100\n And so you have to build all these mechanisms\n\n1:55:57.100 --> 1:55:58.780\n to try to protect yourself from it.\n\n1:55:58.780 --> 1:56:01.020\n So what we did is we said, okay, add data,\n\n1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:02.100\n add a programmability,\n\n1:56:02.100 --> 1:56:03.900\n and you're kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone\n\n1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:06.540\n between what Ethereum did with an account style model\n\n1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:08.420\n and a global state system.\n\n1:56:08.420 --> 1:56:10.580\n And you're not as restrictive as Bitcoin,\n\n1:56:10.580 --> 1:56:12.180\n but you're still in a Turing complete world,\n\n1:56:12.180 --> 1:56:14.100\n you can still run all kinds of things.\n\n1:56:14.100 --> 1:56:16.900\n And then any standard mathematician, they'll say,\n\n1:56:16.900 --> 1:56:19.940\n okay, well, is it isomorphic?\n\n1:56:19.940 --> 1:56:21.140\n Is there a mapping between this?\n\n1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:23.780\n What type of function can I actually take something\n\n1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:25.700\n expressed in one structure\n\n1:56:25.700 --> 1:56:27.540\n and transmit it to the other structure\n\n1:56:27.540 --> 1:56:28.860\n and properties are preserved?\n\n1:56:28.860 --> 1:56:30.820\n So we wrote a paper, it's called Climatic Ledgers,\n\n1:56:30.820 --> 1:56:32.700\n where we actually showed that UTXO,\n\n1:56:32.700 --> 1:56:36.420\n Extended UTXO and accounts are somewhat similar\n\n1:56:36.420 --> 1:56:39.460\n in that you could map things that happen in one system\n\n1:56:39.460 --> 1:56:40.420\n to the other system,\n\n1:56:40.420 --> 1:56:42.540\n the properties are preserved between the two.\n\n1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:45.780\n So in practice, what's nice about Extended UTXO\n\n1:56:45.780 --> 1:56:48.740\n is that you can put infrastructure on top of it\n\n1:56:48.740 --> 1:56:51.420\n to make the development experience relatively similar\n\n1:56:51.420 --> 1:56:52.580\n to the development experience\n\n1:56:52.580 --> 1:56:55.020\n of what you would do with Ethereum,\n\n1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:58.300\n but you don't have to worry about this global state.\n\n1:56:58.300 --> 1:56:59.940\n So when you talk about sharding,\n\n1:56:59.940 --> 1:57:01.340\n it's a lot easier to do that.\n\n1:57:01.340 --> 1:57:02.740\n It's a lot more conceivable to that.\n\n1:57:02.740 --> 1:57:05.260\n And also you get determinism in the system.\n\n1:57:05.260 --> 1:57:07.020\n So when I have a Plutus smart contract,\n\n1:57:07.020 --> 1:57:10.020\n whatever I run locally is exactly what I expect to run\n\n1:57:10.020 --> 1:57:11.300\n in the system.\n\n1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:13.700\n When you have a concept of this mutable global state\n\n1:57:13.700 --> 1:57:15.260\n in the system, whatever you run locally\n\n1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:16.740\n is not necessarily what you're gonna get\n\n1:57:16.740 --> 1:57:18.780\n when you actually push it into the system.\n\n1:57:18.780 --> 1:57:21.740\n So you may misprice things and the contract will fail.\n\n1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:23.980\n It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world.\n\n1:57:23.980 --> 1:57:26.340\n So you got a lot of advantages with this particular model.\n\n1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:29.820\n The downside is that it's a little bit less expressive\n\n1:57:29.820 --> 1:57:31.980\n on the boundaries and a little bit harder\n\n1:57:31.980 --> 1:57:34.860\n to write certain types of software with it.\n\n1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:38.580\n But again, how you resolve that is you kind of build\n\n1:57:38.580 --> 1:57:40.700\n higher level languages and other such things\n\n1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:42.580\n that compensate for these types of things\n\n1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:44.180\n and design patterns that compensate\n\n1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:45.380\n for these types of things.\n\n1:57:45.380 --> 1:57:47.500\n The other advantage that we have that's really fun\n\n1:57:47.500 --> 1:57:50.300\n and exciting is that Bitcoin lives in this model\n\n1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:52.740\n and there are other UTXO based systems.\n\n1:57:52.740 --> 1:57:55.380\n And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well.\n\n1:57:55.380 --> 1:57:58.620\n And they would like to continue working in the UTXO model.\n\n1:57:58.620 --> 1:58:01.340\n So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things,\n\n1:58:01.340 --> 1:58:02.820\n there's actually already a group of people\n\n1:58:02.820 --> 1:58:04.140\n that understand this very well.\n\n1:58:04.140 --> 1:58:06.420\n And that's still a fairly large part\n\n1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:08.380\n of the mindshare of the entire space.\n\n1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:09.780\n So there are no silver bullets.\n\n1:58:09.780 --> 1:58:11.580\n And anytime you pick a particular model,\n\n1:58:11.580 --> 1:58:13.060\n there's an upside and a downside.\n\n1:58:13.060 --> 1:58:14.380\n And there's different ways of doing things\n\n1:58:14.380 --> 1:58:16.260\n from cash register accounting or bank accounting.\n\n1:58:16.260 --> 1:58:18.260\n You can even do different accounting models.\n\n1:58:18.260 --> 1:58:21.620\n But we felt this was kind of the best first step\n\n1:58:21.620 --> 1:58:24.700\n to go into because we started with something very familiar\n\n1:58:24.700 --> 1:58:27.340\n that had a long history behind it.\n\n1:58:27.340 --> 1:58:29.180\n And it maps very beautifully\n\n1:58:29.180 --> 1:58:30.900\n to functional programming principles.\n\n1:58:30.900 --> 1:58:33.140\n This concept of immutability and these things\n\n1:58:33.140 --> 1:58:36.180\n and much more strict management of state\n\n1:58:36.180 --> 1:58:39.580\n and no notion of having this global concept\n\n1:58:39.580 --> 1:58:42.700\n that you have to kind of manage as you break up the system.\n\n1:58:43.900 --> 1:58:46.860\n Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer\n\n1:58:46.860 --> 1:58:50.340\n when they actually start real writing an application?\n\n1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:51.700\n Not too much.\n\n1:58:51.700 --> 1:58:53.220\n There's gonna be a little bit of retooling\n\n1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:54.740\n and some new patterns you have to learn.\n\n1:58:54.740 --> 1:58:56.540\n But in practice, you can still do the same things.\n\n1:58:56.540 --> 1:58:59.380\n You can implement a Uniswap style thing.\n\n1:58:59.380 --> 1:59:00.660\n In fact, we even wrote that code\n\n1:59:00.660 --> 1:59:01.900\n with the Plutus Pioneers program.\n\n1:59:01.900 --> 1:59:03.860\n So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture\n\n1:59:03.860 --> 1:59:05.300\n and see how that's done.\n\n1:59:05.300 --> 1:59:06.780\n You can do a stable coin.\n\n1:59:06.780 --> 1:59:07.940\n You can do an Oracle.\n\n1:59:07.940 --> 1:59:10.060\n You can do interactive contracts.\n\n1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:12.140\n It's just, it has to be done a little differently\n\n1:59:12.140 --> 1:59:14.300\n than the way that you would do it in an account style model.\n\n1:59:14.300 --> 1:59:16.660\n Just like you could run an application in Java,\n\n1:59:16.660 --> 1:59:18.660\n you can run an application in Haskell.\n\n1:59:18.660 --> 1:59:20.020\n They both can do the same thing,\n\n1:59:20.020 --> 1:59:21.380\n but the code is gonna look different.\n\n1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:25.180\n And the canonical way of looking at things is different.\n\n1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:27.620\n So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks,\n\n1:59:27.620 --> 1:59:29.100\n what are your thoughts about chain link\n\n1:59:29.100 --> 1:59:32.220\n and external off chain data sources?\n\n1:59:32.220 --> 1:59:34.620\n And everything we've been talking about now\n\n1:59:34.620 --> 1:59:37.980\n with the external, with the extended UTXO model.\n\n1:59:37.980 --> 1:59:41.780\n Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts without Oracle\n\n1:59:41.780 --> 1:59:43.620\n is like trying to have sex with your pants on.\n\n1:59:43.620 --> 1:59:45.620\n I mean, it's not really fun.\n\n1:59:45.620 --> 1:59:47.620\n It's not exactly the best of things.\n\n1:59:47.620 --> 1:59:49.140\n That's the way I've been doing it all these years.\n\n1:59:49.140 --> 1:59:49.980\n I didn't know.\n\n1:59:49.980 --> 1:59:51.340\n For any other person, Lex,\n\n1:59:51.340 --> 1:59:53.100\n I wouldn't believe you, but for you.\n\n1:59:53.100 --> 1:59:55.620\n That's why I'm single.\n\n1:59:55.620 --> 1:59:57.100\n This makes so much sense now.\n\n1:59:57.100 --> 2:00:01.420\n Okay, so anyway, you need the outside world\n\n2:00:01.420 --> 2:00:03.460\n to be injected into your system, right?\n\n2:00:03.460 --> 2:00:06.300\n I'm trying to keep a straight face.\n\n2:00:06.300 --> 2:00:07.140\n It's great.\n\n2:00:07.140 --> 2:00:09.500\n You need the outside world to make your system useful.\n\n2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:12.020\n It's like all the kinds of things that you care to do\n\n2:00:12.020 --> 2:00:14.740\n with a smart contract usually involve human beings\n\n2:00:14.740 --> 2:00:17.380\n and information streams aggregating and doing something.\n\n2:00:17.380 --> 2:00:20.940\n So the Oracle is a super important component in practice\n\n2:00:20.940 --> 2:00:24.100\n for any smart contract involving any notion of value.\n\n2:00:24.100 --> 2:00:25.460\n You need to know when things have happened,\n\n2:00:25.460 --> 2:00:28.900\n how they happen, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:00:28.900 --> 2:00:31.260\n So first, where do you get the data from?\n\n2:00:31.260 --> 2:00:32.860\n So what's the aggregator?\n\n2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:34.860\n This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram\n\n2:00:34.860 --> 2:00:36.900\n because one of the things you'll know about Wolfram\n\n2:00:36.900 --> 2:00:39.300\n as you get to know the guy is he's a data pack rat.\n\n2:00:39.300 --> 2:00:41.620\n Every email, every communication, every interaction,\n\n2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:43.180\n he's archived somewhere.\n\n2:00:43.180 --> 2:00:44.420\n Like last time I talked to him,\n\n2:00:44.420 --> 2:00:46.420\n oh, yeah, I have emails from you from 2012.\n\n2:00:46.420 --> 2:00:48.060\n It's like, you still have those?\n\n2:00:48.060 --> 2:00:50.220\n Yeah, every keystroke is written down\n\n2:00:50.220 --> 2:00:51.340\n and stored somewhere.\n\n2:00:51.340 --> 2:00:52.740\n So if you use Wolfram Alpha,\n\n2:00:52.740 --> 2:00:55.140\n it's a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks.\n\n2:00:55.140 --> 2:00:57.460\n And so you can query the system and be like,\n\n2:00:57.460 --> 2:00:59.980\n oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida\n\n2:00:59.980 --> 2:01:02.580\n between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted\n\n2:01:02.580 --> 2:01:04.700\n more than a billion dollars of cargo loss\n\n2:01:04.700 --> 2:01:06.620\n and at least one fatality?\n\n2:01:06.620 --> 2:01:08.180\n And it'll return an answer.\n\n2:01:08.180 --> 2:01:11.300\n I mean, it's an incredible source of data that's computable.\n\n2:01:11.300 --> 2:01:13.380\n For people who don't know, Wolfram Alpha\n\n2:01:13.380 --> 2:01:15.380\n is more than just the thing that assists you\n\n2:01:15.380 --> 2:01:18.180\n with your math homework in high school.\n\n2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:20.340\n It's actually this giant network of data\n\n2:01:20.340 --> 2:01:23.380\n of like weather data, of location data,\n\n2:01:23.380 --> 2:01:25.140\n just statistic, all kinds of,\n\n2:01:25.140 --> 2:01:26.780\n it's doing the aggregation in a way\n\n2:01:26.780 --> 2:01:30.660\n that you can query across data sets.\n\n2:01:30.660 --> 2:01:33.260\n And it's exactly this kind of idea.\n\n2:01:34.340 --> 2:01:36.700\n It basically represents the very kind of thing\n\n2:01:36.700 --> 2:01:39.980\n you would hope to be able to query off chain\n\n2:01:39.980 --> 2:01:41.740\n as part of the smart contracts.\n\n2:01:41.740 --> 2:01:44.980\n Right, but the only downside is it's centralized.\n\n2:01:44.980 --> 2:01:47.060\n And that's always the Achilles heel of Wolfram\n\n2:01:47.060 --> 2:01:49.100\n is he tends to like proprietary things\n\n2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:50.620\n and he tends to like centralizing things\n\n2:01:50.620 --> 2:01:53.100\n and mostly because he likes running the things.\n\n2:01:53.100 --> 2:01:56.260\n And everybody can have an opinion on that.\n\n2:01:56.260 --> 2:01:59.660\n The thing though is that after you've done aggregation,\n\n2:01:59.660 --> 2:02:00.940\n there's a question of injection.\n\n2:02:00.940 --> 2:02:04.100\n How do you get that data into the system?\n\n2:02:04.100 --> 2:02:05.940\n And you can do that in a very naive way\n\n2:02:05.940 --> 2:02:07.660\n where you can say, oh, I'm just gonna attach a public key\n\n2:02:07.660 --> 2:02:10.420\n to it and it'll sign for that data feed, that injection.\n\n2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:13.340\n And then somehow I'll just trust it as it is.\n\n2:02:13.340 --> 2:02:16.540\n Or you could try to make it more complicated.\n\n2:02:16.540 --> 2:02:18.860\n You could wait data feeds from different sources\n\n2:02:18.860 --> 2:02:20.700\n and have some notion of truthiness\n\n2:02:20.700 --> 2:02:23.340\n or a veracity metric or something like that.\n\n2:02:23.340 --> 2:02:27.180\n So Chainlink is just one of many different philosophies\n\n2:02:27.180 --> 2:02:29.020\n that was born out of the academy.\n\n2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.940\n I believe Ari Jewell was connected to it\n\n2:02:30.940 --> 2:02:33.020\n and there's some good people on that side.\n\n2:02:33.020 --> 2:02:36.380\n And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate,\n\n2:02:36.380 --> 2:02:38.540\n a philosophy about how do you inject\n\n2:02:38.540 --> 2:02:39.940\n and how do you create incentives\n\n2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:43.420\n so that that process over time gets more federated\n\n2:02:43.420 --> 2:02:46.020\n or more decentralized instead of centralizing\n\n2:02:46.020 --> 2:02:47.900\n around one particular setup.\n\n2:02:47.900 --> 2:02:50.140\n Now, closely related corollary to this\n\n2:02:50.140 --> 2:02:52.900\n is computation off chain.\n\n2:02:52.900 --> 2:02:54.820\n So as I mentioned, smart contracts\n\n2:02:54.820 --> 2:02:56.660\n are intimately connected to our Oracle.\n\n2:02:56.660 --> 2:02:58.340\n The question is how much pre processing\n\n2:02:58.340 --> 2:03:01.420\n and state management are you gonna do outside of the system\n\n2:03:01.420 --> 2:03:03.900\n versus what do you do inside of the system?\n\n2:03:03.900 --> 2:03:07.460\n So it's a very interesting balance between these two.\n\n2:03:07.460 --> 2:03:09.620\n And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time.\n\n2:03:09.620 --> 2:03:11.580\n There's a great paper called Town Crier,\n\n2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:13.380\n came out way back in the day at Cornell.\n\n2:03:13.380 --> 2:03:16.660\n And that was all about using like SGX to scrape things\n\n2:03:16.660 --> 2:03:20.780\n and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data.\n\n2:03:20.780 --> 2:03:22.620\n But you could also use those SGX cores\n\n2:03:22.620 --> 2:03:24.140\n to do contract processing,\n\n2:03:24.140 --> 2:03:25.740\n because if it runs in trusted hardware,\n\n2:03:25.740 --> 2:03:28.980\n then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated.\n\n2:03:28.980 --> 2:03:31.540\n And because of that, you don't have to federate it\n\n2:03:31.540 --> 2:03:33.900\n or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device\n\n2:03:33.900 --> 2:03:36.020\n as if it was running on a cryptocurrency.\n\n2:03:36.020 --> 2:03:38.740\n So there seems to be a desire in that community\n\n2:03:38.740 --> 2:03:42.340\n to capture more and more of the smart contract stack\n\n2:03:42.340 --> 2:03:43.820\n and pull more and more of that stack\n\n2:03:43.820 --> 2:03:45.180\n into that layer two infrastructure\n\n2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:47.140\n from running on layer one.\n\n2:03:47.140 --> 2:03:47.980\n Why?\n\n2:03:47.980 --> 2:03:49.140\n Because you have cost reduction\n\n2:03:49.140 --> 2:03:51.380\n and potentially because your trust model collapses\n\n2:03:51.380 --> 2:03:54.020\n to whatever Chainlink is offering,\n\n2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:55.420\n you're not gaining anything\n\n2:03:55.420 --> 2:04:00.420\n by doing the computation on Ethereum or another platform.\n\n2:04:00.620 --> 2:04:02.780\n Because you ever watched The Simpsons?\n\n2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:04.900\n There was this beautiful episode where Mr. Burns\n\n2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:06.900\n wants to turn the power off in Springfield.\n\n2:04:06.900 --> 2:04:09.980\n It is the perfect analogy for information security.\n\n2:04:09.980 --> 2:04:11.140\n So he and Smithers,\n\n2:04:11.140 --> 2:04:13.540\n they go through this elaborate series of doors\n\n2:04:13.540 --> 2:04:17.060\n and secret passages and guard dogs and robots and shit\n\n2:04:17.060 --> 2:04:18.660\n to get to the center of the power plant\n\n2:04:18.660 --> 2:04:20.020\n to turn off the power.\n\n2:04:20.020 --> 2:04:21.940\n And when they arrive at the center of the plant,\n\n2:04:21.940 --> 2:04:25.380\n there's like this stray dog that's inside the room.\n\n2:04:25.380 --> 2:04:29.180\n And there's this wicker screen door that leads to the outside.\n\n2:04:29.180 --> 2:04:30.580\n And you're like, well, why the hell did you go\n\n2:04:30.580 --> 2:04:32.180\n through this elaborate series of doors and things\n\n2:04:32.180 --> 2:04:34.220\n if there's like a backdoor into your system?\n\n2:04:34.220 --> 2:04:36.740\n Well, that's basically a real life analogy\n\n2:04:36.740 --> 2:04:39.500\n of the relationship between the Oracle\n\n2:04:39.500 --> 2:04:40.660\n and the smart contract.\n\n2:04:40.660 --> 2:04:42.460\n You're only as good in your infrastructure model\n\n2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:43.340\n as your weakest link.\n\n2:04:43.340 --> 2:04:45.660\n And it doesn't matter if all of your computation\n\n2:04:45.660 --> 2:04:48.940\n is decentralized, if you're at the mercy of your data feed.\n\n2:04:48.940 --> 2:04:50.180\n Because I can just manipulate that\n\n2:04:50.180 --> 2:04:52.740\n and break the entire security model of the system, okay?\n\n2:04:52.740 --> 2:04:55.460\n You'll perfectly execute the wrong answer.\n\n2:04:55.460 --> 2:04:57.300\n So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway,\n\n2:04:57.300 --> 2:04:59.980\n why don't you pull more of what you're doing on chain\n\n2:04:59.980 --> 2:05:02.500\n into our stack, which creates more transaction fees for them\n\n2:05:02.500 --> 2:05:04.140\n and more value for them.\n\n2:05:04.140 --> 2:05:06.260\n But there are many different ways you can do oracles.\n\n2:05:06.260 --> 2:05:09.540\n And earlier I was talking about the biology of these things,\n\n2:05:09.540 --> 2:05:11.020\n the cell differentiation.\n\n2:05:11.020 --> 2:05:14.580\n The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system\n\n2:05:14.580 --> 2:05:17.060\n and you start having cells like stake pools\n\n2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:20.020\n or things that are on 24 seven,\n\n2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:22.620\n then you can start asking the what if question.\n\n2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:26.100\n Why don't you guys just also provide data feeds?\n\n2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:28.260\n Why don't you guys also provide state channels\n\n2:05:28.260 --> 2:05:29.940\n or payment channels or generate random numbers\n\n2:05:29.940 --> 2:05:31.140\n from here or whatever?\n\n2:05:31.140 --> 2:05:32.420\n And you're now a service provider.\n\n2:05:32.420 --> 2:05:34.100\n You're making the blockchain full time,\n\n2:05:34.100 --> 2:05:35.420\n but part time you're doing this.\n\n2:05:35.420 --> 2:05:36.380\n And if you're making bagels,\n\n2:05:36.380 --> 2:05:39.060\n you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept.\n\n2:05:39.060 --> 2:05:40.940\n So I think that type of competition\n\n2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:43.700\n is going to be very difficult\n\n2:05:43.700 --> 2:05:47.260\n for a lot of these layer two protocols\n\n2:05:47.260 --> 2:05:49.700\n that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol\n\n2:05:49.700 --> 2:05:52.900\n because the ones that are tightly coupled with the protocol,\n\n2:05:52.900 --> 2:05:54.620\n they have a built in trust advantage.\n\n2:05:54.620 --> 2:05:56.420\n They've already built a commercial reputation.\n\n2:05:56.420 --> 2:05:58.980\n There's already an increasingly more decentralized set.\n\n2:05:58.980 --> 2:06:01.060\n The other thing is you don't need a token.\n\n2:06:01.060 --> 2:06:02.900\n You can just use ADA.\n\n2:06:02.900 --> 2:06:04.260\n You don't need an oracle coin\n\n2:06:04.260 --> 2:06:05.540\n for these types of things to work.\n\n2:06:05.540 --> 2:06:08.660\n And by the way, that's just for the injection component\n\n2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:10.660\n and the veracity attestation.\n\n2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:12.180\n So is it true or not?\n\n2:06:12.180 --> 2:06:13.860\n That's not about the aggregation.\n\n2:06:13.860 --> 2:06:15.980\n That's still a tremendously time intensive,\n\n2:06:15.980 --> 2:06:17.180\n expensive proposition.\n\n2:06:17.180 --> 2:06:18.780\n There's only a few people in the world\n\n2:06:18.780 --> 2:06:21.540\n that have what Steve has with Wolfram.\n\n2:06:21.540 --> 2:06:24.980\n And those guys by just cutting off those supply\n\n2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:26.740\n to replicate what they have is something\n\n2:06:26.740 --> 2:06:28.020\n that would cost hundreds of millions\n\n2:06:28.020 --> 2:06:29.100\n or billions of dollars.\n\n2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:30.380\n And so it's an interesting question\n\n2:06:30.380 --> 2:06:31.780\n of how do you incentivize\n\n2:06:31.780 --> 2:06:33.660\n decentralized aggregation of information?\n\n2:06:33.660 --> 2:06:35.340\n And that's kind of what town crier\n\n2:06:35.340 --> 2:06:37.380\n and other protocols we're trying to achieve.\n\n2:06:37.380 --> 2:06:39.740\n So maybe you can say how town crier works\n\n2:06:39.740 --> 2:06:41.820\n because it's like, what's your vision?\n\n2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:45.020\n You're now partnering with Wolfram and Wolfram Alpha\n\n2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:49.540\n in sort of exploring this partnership of data\n\n2:06:49.540 --> 2:06:51.780\n and the blockchain.\n\n2:06:51.780 --> 2:06:54.460\n What's your vision for a possible distributed version\n\n2:06:54.460 --> 2:06:56.180\n of Wolfram Alpha?\n\n2:06:56.180 --> 2:06:58.380\n Well, the first step is just say,\n\n2:06:58.380 --> 2:06:59.940\n can we use this as a feed?\n\n2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:02.780\n And they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets.\n\n2:07:02.780 --> 2:07:04.460\n So you have a terminal and you have something\n\n2:07:04.460 --> 2:07:06.980\n and there's always a value of at least offering choice.\n\n2:07:06.980 --> 2:07:08.700\n And so it's not like we're anti chain link\n\n2:07:08.700 --> 2:07:10.060\n or picking winners and losers.\n\n2:07:10.060 --> 2:07:11.780\n It's an open protocol, it's an open system.\n\n2:07:11.780 --> 2:07:14.380\n So if we're successful, chain link will migrate\n\n2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:16.060\n or it will at least support us\n\n2:07:16.060 --> 2:07:17.220\n because they like money.\n\n2:07:17.220 --> 2:07:19.100\n They like users, they like liquidity.\n\n2:07:19.100 --> 2:07:20.620\n It's a disservice to their community\n\n2:07:20.620 --> 2:07:23.180\n not to support a potential customer set,\n\n2:07:23.180 --> 2:07:24.460\n but you're gonna have a spectrum\n\n2:07:24.460 --> 2:07:28.420\n from the desire to do a completely decentralized\n\n2:07:28.420 --> 2:07:33.060\n aggregation, curation, injection and veracity attestation\n\n2:07:33.060 --> 2:07:36.420\n to a completely centralized vertically integrated set.\n\n2:07:36.420 --> 2:07:38.260\n You need to be able to have that whole spectrum\n\n2:07:38.260 --> 2:07:40.420\n and offer that to the smart contract developer\n\n2:07:40.420 --> 2:07:42.940\n to decide what makes sense.\n\n2:07:42.940 --> 2:07:44.420\n By the way, a lot of cases,\n\n2:07:44.420 --> 2:07:45.860\n they're gonna be their own Oracle.\n\n2:07:45.860 --> 2:07:49.540\n So for example, the World of Warcraft example that I gave,\n\n2:07:49.540 --> 2:07:51.260\n well, it's a completely centralized thing.\n\n2:07:51.260 --> 2:07:54.140\n It's a video game run by a single company.\n\n2:07:54.140 --> 2:07:55.140\n There's no sense in saying\n\n2:07:55.140 --> 2:07:57.020\n that we're somehow going to decentralize that.\n\n2:07:57.020 --> 2:07:59.300\n What they're just trying to do is extend their currency\n\n2:07:59.300 --> 2:08:02.780\n or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces.\n\n2:08:02.780 --> 2:08:07.420\n So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity\n\n2:08:07.420 --> 2:08:08.900\n and the world state of that,\n\n2:08:08.900 --> 2:08:10.300\n you just have to trust Blizzard\n\n2:08:10.300 --> 2:08:12.060\n to inject that into the system.\n\n2:08:12.060 --> 2:08:14.740\n You could try to imagine some sort of like,\n\n2:08:14.740 --> 2:08:16.980\n Sentinel group of people within the game\n\n2:08:16.980 --> 2:08:18.700\n who keep Blizzard honest,\n\n2:08:18.700 --> 2:08:19.860\n but it's completely unnecessary\n\n2:08:19.860 --> 2:08:20.820\n because they can change the rules\n\n2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:22.420\n of the system arbitrarily.\n\n2:08:22.420 --> 2:08:26.420\n So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency\n\n2:08:26.420 --> 2:08:27.660\n and cost reduction.\n\n2:08:27.660 --> 2:08:30.900\n So you'd want a single feed that gets injected\n\n2:08:30.900 --> 2:08:32.260\n into the system from them.\n\n2:08:32.260 --> 2:08:34.780\n If you look at a stable coin that's algorithmic\n\n2:08:34.780 --> 2:08:37.260\n and it's basing its value on the aggregation\n\n2:08:37.260 --> 2:08:38.980\n of many different exchanges,\n\n2:08:38.980 --> 2:08:41.340\n that's the polar opposite example.\n\n2:08:41.340 --> 2:08:42.300\n Because there you're saying,\n\n2:08:42.300 --> 2:08:45.540\n okay, what's the price of my asset relative to some basket?\n\n2:08:45.540 --> 2:08:48.540\n But how do I know that the price feeds I'm looking at\n\n2:08:48.540 --> 2:08:49.460\n are accurate?\n\n2:08:49.460 --> 2:08:51.260\n You'd have to look at Binance and Bittrex\n\n2:08:51.260 --> 2:08:52.100\n and all these other things,\n\n2:08:52.100 --> 2:08:53.660\n or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges\n\n2:08:53.660 --> 2:08:54.740\n or something like that.\n\n2:08:54.740 --> 2:08:57.260\n Okay, well, how do you weight that?\n\n2:08:57.260 --> 2:08:59.700\n And how do you clip outliers and these types of things?\n\n2:08:59.700 --> 2:09:01.420\n That's a completely different conversation.\n\n2:09:01.420 --> 2:09:04.420\n There's a lot more mechanics you have to put in\n\n2:09:04.420 --> 2:09:07.300\n for that bundling and attestation of the veracity\n\n2:09:07.300 --> 2:09:08.260\n of the data feed.\n\n2:09:08.260 --> 2:09:09.860\n And what happens if you get it wrong?\n\n2:09:09.860 --> 2:09:13.820\n Your stable coin gets mispriced and everything goes to hell.\n\n2:09:13.820 --> 2:09:15.940\n And the markets will eventually correct it\n\n2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:17.660\n for arbitrage seeking behavior,\n\n2:09:17.660 --> 2:09:19.660\n but anything that was built on that will fail\n\n2:09:19.660 --> 2:09:21.300\n in the short term.\n\n2:09:21.300 --> 2:09:23.460\n So Oracle is really just a game of,\n\n2:09:23.460 --> 2:09:25.100\n you have to build a standardized interfaces\n\n2:09:25.100 --> 2:09:27.620\n and make it as easy as possible for people to do that.\n\n2:09:27.620 --> 2:09:31.100\n And then let people choose how they wanna inject data\n\n2:09:31.100 --> 2:09:34.140\n and what level of assurance do they need behind that?\n\n2:09:34.140 --> 2:09:36.300\n And the question is, how much do you leave to the user\n\n2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:38.780\n versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?\n\n2:09:38.780 --> 2:09:40.940\n And it's a difficult design question.\n\n2:09:40.940 --> 2:09:43.980\n For our part, we love working with Steve and Wolfram\n\n2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:45.100\n and they're a great company\n\n2:09:45.100 --> 2:09:47.140\n and they really have some bright people there.\n\n2:09:47.140 --> 2:09:49.860\n And we know on the data set, they're second to none\n\n2:09:49.860 --> 2:09:51.540\n because not only do they have it, it's computable.\n\n2:09:51.540 --> 2:09:52.860\n You can do all kinds of things\n\n2:09:52.860 --> 2:09:55.340\n and manipulate with a very rich query language.\n\n2:09:55.340 --> 2:09:56.540\n So that's a great thing.\n\n2:09:56.540 --> 2:09:58.420\n And we wanna make sure that that's accessible\n\n2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:00.620\n to developers and Cardano.\n\n2:10:00.620 --> 2:10:01.820\n Remember, they're like Bloomberg.\n\n2:10:01.820 --> 2:10:04.300\n It's a centralized speed in that respect.\n\n2:10:04.300 --> 2:10:06.900\n So if you wanna build a Chainlink S competitor,\n\n2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:09.500\n there's other protocols you could do for that.\n\n2:10:09.500 --> 2:10:10.700\n Now you asked about Tom Cryer\n\n2:10:10.700 --> 2:10:14.700\n and that was an attempt to kind of sweep the oceans\n\n2:10:14.700 --> 2:10:19.700\n with the net, get the data through a decentralized way.\n\n2:10:19.900 --> 2:10:22.180\n And that was just saying, hey, let's use trusted hardware\n\n2:10:22.180 --> 2:10:24.500\n to go read all kinds of websites and other things.\n\n2:10:24.500 --> 2:10:26.060\n And because it's trusted hardware,\n\n2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:28.660\n the scraping is nonbiased.\n\n2:10:28.660 --> 2:10:31.020\n If you find something inconvenient to whatever\n\n2:10:31.020 --> 2:10:32.580\n the person who's scraping is,\n\n2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:35.300\n trusted hardware will still do it and it can't be changed.\n\n2:10:35.300 --> 2:10:37.900\n You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that.\n\n2:10:37.900 --> 2:10:40.340\n So that's great, but you still run into the problem\n\n2:10:40.340 --> 2:10:42.060\n of how do you wire that together?\n\n2:10:42.060 --> 2:10:44.980\n The underlying websites still don't have any notion\n\n2:10:44.980 --> 2:10:47.340\n of veracity or reputation behind them.\n\n2:10:47.340 --> 2:10:49.500\n And then you also have the issue of storage.\n\n2:10:49.500 --> 2:10:51.300\n Where the hell do you put all of it?\n\n2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:53.300\n If you have exabytes of data,\n\n2:10:53.300 --> 2:10:54.780\n what's the incentive for that?\n\n2:10:54.780 --> 2:10:56.660\n That's the dream of the Semantic Web.\n\n2:10:56.660 --> 2:10:58.820\n I still think is a fascinating idea\n\n2:10:58.820 --> 2:11:02.100\n how to basically convert the internet into a core,\n\n2:11:02.100 --> 2:11:06.660\n like a knowledge base that you can query,\n\n2:11:06.660 --> 2:11:08.060\n you can integrate in the same way you did\n\n2:11:08.060 --> 2:11:11.300\n with Wolfram Alpha, but much bigger.\n\n2:11:11.300 --> 2:11:14.860\n But that means basically revolutionizing\n\n2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:17.420\n the way we put the internet together,\n\n2:11:17.420 --> 2:11:22.420\n which I think these ideas of off chain data\n\n2:11:22.420 --> 2:11:26.940\n will motivate people, because there's a lot of money\n\n2:11:26.940 --> 2:11:27.780\n to be made.\n\n2:11:27.780 --> 2:11:30.900\n Finally, there's money to be made with the Semantic Web.\n\n2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:32.780\n So that'll be an interesting kind of future.\n\n2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:35.060\n I do want to ask you about video games really quick\n\n2:11:35.060 --> 2:11:37.300\n as a small tangent, because you said this really\n\n2:11:37.300 --> 2:11:40.300\n interesting idea of Blizzard being centralized control.\n\n2:11:40.300 --> 2:11:44.540\n Is it possible to have items in the game\n\n2:11:45.660 --> 2:11:48.780\n that are not controlled by Blizzard?\n\n2:11:48.780 --> 2:11:49.620\n Sure.\n\n2:11:49.620 --> 2:11:51.980\n Being controlled in a decentralized fashion\n\n2:11:51.980 --> 2:11:53.220\n that you can, like what is it,\n\n2:11:53.220 --> 2:11:56.140\n the grandfather sword in Diablo?\n\n2:11:56.140 --> 2:11:58.100\n Hmm, what was it really?\n\n2:11:58.100 --> 2:11:59.220\n Somebody was criticizing me.\n\n2:11:59.220 --> 2:12:01.140\n I was saying all these kinds of nice things\n\n2:12:01.140 --> 2:12:04.140\n about Diablo III, and they said Diablo II Resurrected\n\n2:12:04.140 --> 2:12:05.700\n is coming out, they need to check it out.\n\n2:12:05.700 --> 2:12:08.100\n There's a lot of camps and wars that need to be done.\n\n2:12:08.100 --> 2:12:09.420\n Come on, we both know that Diablo II\n\n2:12:09.420 --> 2:12:10.460\n is far better than Diablo III.\n\n2:12:10.460 --> 2:12:11.540\n That's what they're saying.\n\n2:12:11.540 --> 2:12:12.980\n This is the war that they're having.\n\n2:12:12.980 --> 2:12:15.820\n Okay, so we'll play it, it's coming out soon,\n\n2:12:15.820 --> 2:12:17.060\n I'll play it, fine.\n\n2:12:17.060 --> 2:12:20.180\n But nevertheless, those items are owned by Blizzard.\n\n2:12:20.180 --> 2:12:23.300\n Is it possible to create video games\n\n2:12:23.300 --> 2:12:28.020\n where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard,\n\n2:12:28.020 --> 2:12:32.660\n and do you think in like a half century from now\n\n2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:34.260\n we will all live in those games,\n\n2:12:34.260 --> 2:12:35.980\n and we'll forget the physical space even exists?\n\n2:12:35.980 --> 2:12:37.420\n Well, yeah, that's definitely possible.\n\n2:12:37.420 --> 2:12:39.740\n I look at CryptoKitties, that's a great example of that.\n\n2:12:39.740 --> 2:12:41.140\n Can you explain what CryptoKitties is?\n\n2:12:41.140 --> 2:12:42.660\n Well, it's basically just a video game\n\n2:12:42.660 --> 2:12:44.180\n that kind of lives on a blockchain,\n\n2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:46.500\n and the creatures within the game\n\n2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:48.940\n can breed with each other and create new CryptoKitties,\n\n2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:50.180\n and you can own them.\n\n2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:52.980\n So it's like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi\n\n2:12:52.980 --> 2:12:54.380\n with lots of money behind it.\n\n2:12:54.380 --> 2:12:58.220\n But anyway, the thing is those assets\n\n2:12:58.220 --> 2:13:00.860\n actually have a blockchain based representation.\n\n2:13:00.860 --> 2:13:03.060\n And so whether the infrastructure\n\n2:13:03.060 --> 2:13:05.800\n that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off,\n\n2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:09.740\n because that ledger exists outside of the game,\n\n2:13:09.740 --> 2:13:12.720\n any person can come in and replicate it, restore it,\n\n2:13:12.720 --> 2:13:16.740\n and turn it back on sans intellectual property.\n\n2:13:16.740 --> 2:13:19.180\n So yeah, it's completely possible\n\n2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:20.720\n to break your architecture up\n\n2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:24.100\n where you have a notion of the player part,\n\n2:13:24.100 --> 2:13:27.180\n and then you have a notion of the experience part,\n\n2:13:27.180 --> 2:13:29.900\n and you can interchange experiences,\n\n2:13:29.900 --> 2:13:32.260\n almost like you do cascading style sheets or something\n\n2:13:32.260 --> 2:13:33.780\n for different presentations,\n\n2:13:33.780 --> 2:13:36.720\n and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players.\n\n2:13:36.720 --> 2:13:38.060\n So yeah, that's definitely doable.\n\n2:13:38.060 --> 2:13:40.500\n And frankly, that's what's gonna happen in the gaming world,\n\n2:13:40.500 --> 2:13:42.020\n because there's so much value in that.\n\n2:13:42.020 --> 2:13:43.540\n I mean, everybody wants play,\n\n2:13:43.540 --> 2:13:46.220\n and right now the model is you make a game,\n\n2:13:46.220 --> 2:13:50.420\n you sell licenses, and you have a huge surge of people\n\n2:13:50.420 --> 2:13:52.340\n at the beginning of the game buying the video game,\n\n2:13:52.340 --> 2:13:54.060\n and then you have this long tail,\n\n2:13:54.060 --> 2:13:56.400\n but you've gotten almost 95% of your value\n\n2:13:56.400 --> 2:13:58.820\n in the first six months, and you have a huge churn rate.\n\n2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:00.160\n The odds are the vast majority of people\n\n2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:02.440\n won't be playing the game within 12 months.\n\n2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:04.140\n But if you can create an interactive game\n\n2:14:04.140 --> 2:14:06.140\n where there's an actual economy inside the game,\n\n2:14:06.140 --> 2:14:08.460\n then you have EVE Online, or Second Life,\n\n2:14:08.460 --> 2:14:09.280\n or any of these things,\n\n2:14:09.280 --> 2:14:10.720\n where you have people playing for 10 years,\n\n2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:12.580\n and there's like people buying virtual real estate\n\n2:14:12.580 --> 2:14:13.740\n and all these other things.\n\n2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:16.180\n You as the game developer actually don't have to create\n\n2:14:16.180 --> 2:14:17.620\n a lot of content.\n\n2:14:17.620 --> 2:14:20.380\n So your long tail gets a lot fatter,\n\n2:14:20.380 --> 2:14:21.900\n and it generates a lot more revenue,\n\n2:14:21.900 --> 2:14:23.740\n and your cost of operating the system\n\n2:14:23.740 --> 2:14:25.900\n is fairly fixed or diminishing.\n\n2:14:25.900 --> 2:14:28.100\n So the economics align for doing exactly\n\n2:14:28.100 --> 2:14:30.820\n what you're talking about, and I think it'll get done.\n\n2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:34.300\n Well, I just saw recently sort of this calculation\n\n2:14:34.300 --> 2:14:39.300\n that people played WoW and Fortnite for 140 billion hours.\n\n2:14:40.260 --> 2:14:41.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:14:41.420 --> 2:14:44.860\n So, and that's without the economic incentives there.\n\n2:14:44.860 --> 2:14:47.860\n So do you think it's possible that like most of our economy\n\n2:14:47.860 --> 2:14:52.700\n in the future, people playing video games essentially?\n\n2:14:52.700 --> 2:14:56.500\n Like, okay, so one vision of the future,\n\n2:14:56.500 --> 2:14:58.180\n especially with AI and automation,\n\n2:14:58.180 --> 2:15:01.540\n that people like, that we get wealthier and wealthier,\n\n2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:04.580\n there's this kind of rising GDP for the entire world,\n\n2:15:04.580 --> 2:15:06.780\n and then people are losing their jobs,\n\n2:15:06.780 --> 2:15:08.760\n but they're still well off enough\n\n2:15:08.760 --> 2:15:11.360\n to be able to have a high quality of life.\n\n2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:12.820\n So we're all looking for meaning,\n\n2:15:12.820 --> 2:15:14.980\n and the meaning we'll find is by playing video games,\n\n2:15:14.980 --> 2:15:17.180\n and now there's this extra levels,\n\n2:15:17.180 --> 2:15:19.720\n like you can be a Bill Gates within a video game world,\n\n2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:22.660\n in the digital world as opposed to the physical world.\n\n2:15:22.660 --> 2:15:24.820\n Is that, do you think that's the future?\n\n2:15:24.820 --> 2:15:26.100\n You just wanna have the Westworld\n\n2:15:26.100 --> 2:15:28.180\n if you can't tell the difference, does it matter?\n\n2:15:28.180 --> 2:15:29.420\n Lion uttered to you.\n\n2:15:30.900 --> 2:15:32.820\n Did you ever interview Yuval Harari?\n\n2:15:32.820 --> 2:15:34.240\n Not yet, eventually.\n\n2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:35.780\n Well, yeah, but yeah, I guess, you know,\n\n2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:38.580\n Homo Dias, that's kind of like the roadmap there, right?\n\n2:15:38.580 --> 2:15:42.340\n This hedonistic dystopia where everybody just lives\n\n2:15:42.340 --> 2:15:44.980\n wired into some simulation,\n\n2:15:44.980 --> 2:15:46.420\n and there's some movies about that,\n\n2:15:46.420 --> 2:15:49.740\n Ready Player One, and the other one was Surrogate,\n\n2:15:49.740 --> 2:15:52.960\n and so forth, so yeah, Hollywood has certainly visualized\n\n2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:54.620\n what this could be, but you know,\n\n2:15:54.620 --> 2:15:58.360\n I'm not so pessimistic in that respect.\n\n2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:00.140\n I do believe that the video game world\n\n2:16:00.140 --> 2:16:01.620\n is evolving at an amazing pace,\n\n2:16:01.620 --> 2:16:03.740\n if you're looking at where Unreal is at,\n\n2:16:03.740 --> 2:16:06.220\n is just incredible, the latest Unreal Engine,\n\n2:16:06.220 --> 2:16:09.100\n and within one or two more ticks of that clock,\n\n2:16:09.100 --> 2:16:11.380\n the iteration, so five to 10 years,\n\n2:16:11.380 --> 2:16:15.100\n the photorealism will be so good that it'll be hard\n\n2:16:15.100 --> 2:16:18.900\n to distinguish between real life and video games,\n\n2:16:18.900 --> 2:16:20.980\n and you know, the hardware is almost there,\n\n2:16:20.980 --> 2:16:22.940\n so the question is then,\n\n2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:25.260\n when you have photorealistic experiences\n\n2:16:25.260 --> 2:16:27.980\n where you've successfully traversed the uncanny valley\n\n2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:29.820\n to a point where it's good enough,\n\n2:16:29.820 --> 2:16:33.960\n then will virtual reality be more desirable\n\n2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:35.900\n than actual reality?\n\n2:16:35.900 --> 2:16:37.180\n And for the vast majority of people,\n\n2:16:37.180 --> 2:16:38.520\n the answer's probably yes,\n\n2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:42.100\n because actual reality's tough, it's hard, you know,\n\n2:16:42.100 --> 2:16:46.740\n but then your knowledge that you live in a virtual world\n\n2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:48.960\n actually becomes a problem for you,\n\n2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:52.180\n so there's gonna be this kind of sad, dark industry\n\n2:16:52.180 --> 2:16:54.140\n where people try to create amnesia,\n\n2:16:54.140 --> 2:16:55.640\n where they're not aware that they're inside\n\n2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:57.980\n the virtual world, and so that's interesting.\n\n2:16:57.980 --> 2:16:58.820\n Why is it sad?\n\n2:16:58.820 --> 2:17:00.400\n I mean, it's almost like a...\n\n2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:02.600\n Because you know it's not real,\n\n2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:05.060\n but if you could forget that it's not real,\n\n2:17:05.060 --> 2:17:07.760\n then you believe what you're experiencing is real.\n\n2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.460\n Yeah, but yeah, so what?\n\n2:17:09.460 --> 2:17:12.820\n You forget, like you forget all the ugly parts of life,\n\n2:17:12.820 --> 2:17:14.980\n which is the physical, the meat space,\n\n2:17:14.980 --> 2:17:16.700\n and then you get to enjoy video games.\n\n2:17:16.700 --> 2:17:18.160\n But it's always lurking in the back of your mind\n\n2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:19.160\n that you're in the matrix.\n\n2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:20.660\n Well, that's... You have to not be in the matrix.\n\n2:17:20.660 --> 2:17:22.980\n That's just why the bald dude in the matrix was like,\n\n2:17:22.980 --> 2:17:25.200\n I wanna be rich and have a beautiful wife\n\n2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:27.020\n and eat a steak every day.\n\n2:17:27.020 --> 2:17:29.100\n You know, he didn't wanna know he was in the matrix.\n\n2:17:29.100 --> 2:17:31.100\n So you would take the red pill, not the blue pill.\n\n2:17:31.100 --> 2:17:34.940\n Well, no, hang on, it depends on how good\n\n2:17:34.940 --> 2:17:36.300\n the virtual world is, Lex.\n\n2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:37.580\n Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you,\n\n2:17:37.580 --> 2:17:40.980\n is I mean, isn't that what most of the beautiful experiences\n\n2:17:40.980 --> 2:17:45.980\n about human life are, is forgetting for a moment,\n\n2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:48.620\n for a time, like the mess of it?\n\n2:17:48.620 --> 2:17:49.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:49.460 --> 2:17:51.360\n I mean, that's what love is, is you forget.\n\n2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:53.420\n Like all of a sudden everything is beautiful,\n\n2:17:53.420 --> 2:17:55.460\n but like the reality is you're gonna lose that person\n\n2:17:55.460 --> 2:17:57.140\n and most likely love will fade.\n\n2:17:57.140 --> 2:17:59.380\n And no matter what, even if it doesn't,\n\n2:17:59.380 --> 2:18:01.220\n you're both gonna be dead soon.\n\n2:18:01.220 --> 2:18:02.260\n Jesus Christ.\n\n2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:06.020\n So I'm taking the blue pill on that one.\n\n2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:07.940\n You went full Ernest Becker on me, man.\n\n2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:08.780\n Okay.\n\n2:18:10.780 --> 2:18:12.420\n But you know, I get what you're saying though,\n\n2:18:12.420 --> 2:18:14.900\n and then actually, but then it begs the question,\n\n2:18:14.900 --> 2:18:17.020\n how do we, and it goes back to the very first question\n\n2:18:17.020 --> 2:18:18.500\n you asked in this interview, which is like,\n\n2:18:18.500 --> 2:18:20.040\n how do we know we're not in a simulation?\n\n2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:22.860\n Or, you know, is this Bostrom's concepts\n\n2:18:22.860 --> 2:18:24.720\n or these ideas like real?\n\n2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:26.580\n Well, it's entirely possible that we are\n\n2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:30.020\n and that we desire to be because the real world\n\n2:18:30.020 --> 2:18:32.300\n is horrifically dystopian or bad,\n\n2:18:32.300 --> 2:18:35.240\n or maybe we actually don't exist, we're completely virtual\n\n2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:36.620\n and does it matter?\n\n2:18:36.620 --> 2:18:38.260\n And I'd argue that it probably doesn't\n\n2:18:38.260 --> 2:18:40.100\n at some certain point.\n\n2:18:40.100 --> 2:18:41.420\n If you're at the end of your life\n\n2:18:41.420 --> 2:18:43.620\n and you're 90s dying of cancer,\n\n2:18:43.620 --> 2:18:45.820\n the fact that you can live out being young, healthy,\n\n2:18:45.820 --> 2:18:48.100\n and 25 is probably a desirable thing\n\n2:18:48.100 --> 2:18:50.060\n and no one would ever complain about that.\n\n2:18:50.060 --> 2:18:53.180\n Where it becomes problematic is if the vast majority\n\n2:18:53.180 --> 2:18:57.620\n of society enters this virtual simulacra of reality\n\n2:18:57.620 --> 2:18:59.660\n and as a consequence, nothing works\n\n2:18:59.660 --> 2:19:01.260\n because there's no one to do anything,\n\n2:19:01.260 --> 2:19:03.620\n society falls apart in that respect.\n\n2:19:03.620 --> 2:19:05.860\n There's no desire to do anything in the real world.\n\n2:19:05.860 --> 2:19:09.140\n Innovation stops, the desire to actually do real work stops\n\n2:19:09.140 --> 2:19:12.340\n because you're always inside this virtual economy.\n\n2:19:12.340 --> 2:19:14.740\n So I don't know, it's an interesting question,\n\n2:19:14.740 --> 2:19:18.660\n but drawing it back more to where we're at today,\n\n2:19:18.660 --> 2:19:20.500\n the evolution factors are there.\n\n2:19:20.500 --> 2:19:22.940\n VR is evolving at a very rapid rate.\n\n2:19:22.940 --> 2:19:25.820\n The game engines are just incredible today\n\n2:19:25.820 --> 2:19:27.880\n and they're really doing amazing things.\n\n2:19:27.880 --> 2:19:30.700\n And there seems to be an overwhelming desire\n\n2:19:30.700 --> 2:19:33.480\n for people to escape the harshness of where they live,\n\n2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:36.060\n just by evidence by how many billions of hours\n\n2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:37.340\n have been spent playing video games.\n\n2:19:37.340 --> 2:19:39.020\n People still play Skyrim.\n\n2:19:39.020 --> 2:19:41.100\n Yeah, it's a good game.\n\n2:19:41.100 --> 2:19:42.940\n It's probably my favorite game\n\n2:19:42.940 --> 2:19:44.660\n of the whole Elder Scrolls series.\n\n2:19:44.660 --> 2:19:47.860\n But it's fascinating because smart contracts\n\n2:19:47.860 --> 2:19:50.020\n is actually the mechanism by which we take a lot\n\n2:19:50.020 --> 2:19:52.740\n of the meatspace stuff and move it to the digital world.\n\n2:19:52.740 --> 2:19:55.740\n So all the stuff we've been talking about\n\n2:19:55.740 --> 2:19:59.700\n is really probably the mechanisms which take us there,\n\n2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:03.100\n which I find that world not dystopian.\n\n2:20:03.100 --> 2:20:04.340\n I find that world quite dystopian\n\n2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:05.500\n because there's so many opportunities\n\n2:20:05.500 --> 2:20:07.220\n to create beautiful experiences.\n\n2:20:08.900 --> 2:20:11.340\n But since we're talking about the future,\n\n2:20:11.340 --> 2:20:13.140\n let me ask you a timeline question,\n\n2:20:14.100 --> 2:20:15.580\n or even just like definitional.\n\n2:20:15.580 --> 2:20:16.760\n What is Alonzo?\n\n2:20:17.620 --> 2:20:20.920\n You mentioned some fun Hello World experiments going on.\n\n2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:22.260\n Right, right.\n\n2:20:22.260 --> 2:20:26.380\n And how and when will Cardano get smart contracts?\n\n2:20:26.380 --> 2:20:29.460\n Yeah, so Alonzo Church is a famous, famous mathematician,\n\n2:20:29.460 --> 2:20:32.260\n computer science guy, and he was a contemporary of Turing.\n\n2:20:32.260 --> 2:20:34.420\n And there was like these three different views\n\n2:20:34.420 --> 2:20:36.540\n of computing, recursive functions from G\u00f6del\n\n2:20:36.540 --> 2:20:37.900\n and Turing machines from Turing,\n\n2:20:37.900 --> 2:20:40.700\n and Church had lambda calculus, and they're all equivalent,\n\n2:20:40.700 --> 2:20:42.860\n and they all give you the ability to build a computer.\n\n2:20:42.860 --> 2:20:46.020\n So we like functional programming, so we decided.\n\n2:20:46.020 --> 2:20:47.900\n That's your favorite Church.\n\n2:20:47.900 --> 2:20:49.460\n So we had to name something after Church,\n\n2:20:49.460 --> 2:20:52.100\n and it's just weird that we never did.\n\n2:20:52.100 --> 2:20:54.660\n So we said, okay, Alonzo is a good release name.\n\n2:20:54.660 --> 2:20:56.660\n Basically, it was bringing smart contracts to Cardano.\n\n2:20:56.660 --> 2:20:58.220\n Took us a long time to get here,\n\n2:20:58.220 --> 2:21:00.220\n and we'll be there in the next 90 days.\n\n2:21:00.220 --> 2:21:03.980\n It's like everything we do, there's a process,\n\n2:21:03.980 --> 2:21:05.700\n and so there's all the colors of the rainbow.\n\n2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:09.460\n We start with Alonzo blue, and then white, and purple.\n\n2:21:09.460 --> 2:21:11.240\n And each step, you do some more things.\n\n2:21:11.240 --> 2:21:13.220\n You bring more users in, and then eventually,\n\n2:21:13.220 --> 2:21:15.420\n you get to a threshold where you say,\n\n2:21:15.420 --> 2:21:17.020\n okay, everything works the way intended,\n\n2:21:17.020 --> 2:21:18.700\n and you push a button, and we initiate\n\n2:21:18.700 --> 2:21:20.180\n what's called a hard fork combinator event,\n\n2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:22.700\n and boom, the system has smart contracts.\n\n2:21:22.700 --> 2:21:24.260\n You just wake up, and it's there.\n\n2:21:24.260 --> 2:21:25.820\n It's like it's in your house.\n\n2:21:25.820 --> 2:21:26.660\n So it's gonna be a hard fork.\n\n2:21:26.660 --> 2:21:28.140\n It's like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter,\n\n2:21:28.140 --> 2:21:29.460\n I woke up, and I had it.\n\n2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:32.300\n Yeah, and you were never the same.\n\n2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:33.180\n You can't go back.\n\n2:21:33.180 --> 2:21:34.740\n It's a, yeah, like hard fork.\n\n2:21:34.740 --> 2:21:36.020\n It's a hard fork of Charles.\n\n2:21:36.020 --> 2:21:36.860\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:21:36.860 --> 2:21:37.680\n You got blue mark.\n\n2:21:37.680 --> 2:21:39.700\n Well, actually, I think you can take it away, but.\n\n2:21:39.700 --> 2:21:41.620\n Can they take my check mark away, Flex?\n\n2:21:41.620 --> 2:21:42.460\n I think.\n\n2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:46.340\n Oh, but that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess.\n\n2:21:47.340 --> 2:21:48.780\n Okay, so great.\n\n2:21:48.780 --> 2:21:53.780\n So that's, but currently, there's a testing procedure\n\n2:21:55.380 --> 2:21:58.420\n going on to see what does that look like,\n\n2:21:58.420 --> 2:22:00.100\n and what will give you confidence\n\n2:22:00.100 --> 2:22:00.980\n that things are working well.\n\n2:22:00.980 --> 2:22:02.940\n Yeah, so first, you start with the marry era,\n\n2:22:02.940 --> 2:22:04.900\n which is where we're right now multi assets.\n\n2:22:04.900 --> 2:22:08.080\n So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano,\n\n2:22:08.080 --> 2:22:11.180\n but you'd have limited programmability on chain.\n\n2:22:11.180 --> 2:22:13.300\n Alonzo adds the programmability in,\n\n2:22:13.300 --> 2:22:15.220\n but we already have most of the foundations\n\n2:22:15.220 --> 2:22:16.540\n of the extended UTXO model,\n\n2:22:16.540 --> 2:22:17.940\n and the smart contract model is just,\n\n2:22:17.940 --> 2:22:19.340\n those things aren't ready.\n\n2:22:19.340 --> 2:22:21.500\n So the first step is, say, fork it,\n\n2:22:21.500 --> 2:22:23.780\n so all those rules are now there, okay?\n\n2:22:23.780 --> 2:22:25.460\n That's what we did with Alonzo Blue.\n\n2:22:25.460 --> 2:22:29.860\n We forked a testnet base layer, and it successfully survived\n\n2:22:29.860 --> 2:22:31.820\n going from marry to Alonzo,\n\n2:22:31.820 --> 2:22:33.420\n which means that you can move transactions\n\n2:22:33.420 --> 2:22:34.420\n from one side to the other.\n\n2:22:34.420 --> 2:22:35.840\n Both systems work.\n\n2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:37.820\n And then the next step is, say, okay, well,\n\n2:22:37.820 --> 2:22:39.500\n are the stake pool operators, people who run\n\n2:22:39.500 --> 2:22:41.540\n the infrastructure, able to run this testnet\n\n2:22:41.540 --> 2:22:42.860\n just like they run Cardano?\n\n2:22:42.860 --> 2:22:44.220\n And that's what we're doing right now with Blue.\n\n2:22:44.220 --> 2:22:45.860\n We're bringing all these SPOs in,\n\n2:22:45.860 --> 2:22:48.880\n and then are we able to submit and run smart contracts\n\n2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:49.720\n on the system?\n\n2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:51.300\n And they actually return a round trip.\n\n2:22:51.300 --> 2:22:53.040\n You send something, you get something back.\n\n2:22:53.040 --> 2:22:54.780\n Yay, okay.\n\n2:22:54.780 --> 2:22:55.620\n So that's where we're at.\n\n2:22:55.620 --> 2:22:57.780\n And then what you do is each step,\n\n2:22:57.780 --> 2:23:00.400\n so the next is white, you go from like 50 people\n\n2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:03.900\n to several hundred, and then purple's an open testnet\n\n2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:06.700\n where we want every single person in the entire ecosystem\n\n2:23:06.700 --> 2:23:08.600\n to use it, and it's also a DevNet.\n\n2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:10.420\n So that means that people who are writing\n\n2:23:10.420 --> 2:23:12.860\n with Pluse Playground and local interpreters,\n\n2:23:12.860 --> 2:23:16.020\n their smart contracts can actually start testing them now\n\n2:23:16.020 --> 2:23:17.460\n on the public infrastructure.\n\n2:23:17.460 --> 2:23:20.580\n So it's kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox\n\n2:23:20.580 --> 2:23:21.420\n or something like that.\n\n2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:22.820\n You send them out to game developers\n\n2:23:22.820 --> 2:23:23.980\n before you release the Xbox,\n\n2:23:23.980 --> 2:23:26.580\n so they can test their video games in anticipation\n\n2:23:26.580 --> 2:23:27.980\n of the release of the system.\n\n2:23:27.980 --> 2:23:29.380\n So you run that for at least a month,\n\n2:23:29.380 --> 2:23:31.740\n and as long as it doesn't blow up in your face,\n\n2:23:31.740 --> 2:23:33.740\n and oh God, what have we done, Hindenburg,\n\n2:23:33.740 --> 2:23:37.480\n oh the humanity, you release it and you ship it.\n\n2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:39.620\n The problem is it's no longer in our control.\n\n2:23:39.620 --> 2:23:42.300\n There's over 100 exchanges that have listed Cardano.\n\n2:23:42.300 --> 2:23:43.780\n There's lots of wallet infrastructure.\n\n2:23:43.780 --> 2:23:45.980\n There are thousands of different constituencies.\n\n2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:49.000\n So it's less of a technological problem now,\n\n2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.020\n and it's more of a coordination problem.\n\n2:23:51.020 --> 2:23:54.660\n So you have to evolve in a very methodical way,\n\n2:23:54.660 --> 2:23:56.820\n and each step of the way you bring new actors in,\n\n2:23:56.820 --> 2:23:58.020\n they get ready for it.\n\n2:23:58.020 --> 2:23:59.800\n They upgrade their infrastructure to it,\n\n2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:01.880\n and then like shells, eventually,\n\n2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:03.360\n you get to the outer shell,\n\n2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:05.300\n which is the hard fork for the general public.\n\n2:24:05.300 --> 2:24:08.280\n And if we've done it right, like that blue check mark,\n\n2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:11.020\n they wake up and it's exactly the same.\n\n2:24:11.020 --> 2:24:14.540\n They just get a little update thing, update your client.\n\n2:24:14.540 --> 2:24:16.060\n And they start demanding Wagyu beef.\n\n2:24:16.060 --> 2:24:17.480\n Is there stuff you're worried about\n\n2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:21.680\n in terms of like when something's this tricky,\n\n2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:24.180\n you know, goes up several orders of magnitudes\n\n2:24:24.180 --> 2:24:25.640\n in terms of scale?\n\n2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:27.440\n Are there problems that you foresee?\n\n2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:30.940\n Is there, like we said, there's game theoretic aspects,\n\n2:24:30.940 --> 2:24:32.380\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:33.860\n Like what worries you the most?\n\n2:24:33.860 --> 2:24:35.460\n I mean, I sleep like a baby.\n\n2:24:35.460 --> 2:24:37.500\n I wake up every two hours crying.\n\n2:24:37.500 --> 2:24:38.340\n Um.\n\n2:24:38.340 --> 2:24:39.180\n Um.\n\n2:24:39.180 --> 2:24:40.000\n Um.\n\n2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:40.840\n Um.\n\n2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:41.680\n Um.\n\n2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:42.520\n Um.\n\n2:24:42.520 --> 2:24:43.340\n Um.\n\n2:24:43.340 --> 2:24:44.180\n Um.\n\n2:24:44.180 --> 2:24:45.020\n Um.\n\n2:24:45.020 --> 2:24:45.840\n Um.\n\n2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:46.680\n Um.\n\n2:24:46.680 --> 2:24:49.060\n And what makes no sense, I slept like a baby.\n\n2:24:49.060 --> 2:24:49.900\n But go ahead.\n\n2:24:49.900 --> 2:24:51.640\n Yeah, yeah, exactly, right.\n\n2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:54.300\n Messing your whole world up right now, Alex.\n\n2:24:54.300 --> 2:24:55.140\n Um.\n\n2:24:55.140 --> 2:24:56.700\n No, I mean, there's so much that keeps me up at night.\n\n2:24:56.700 --> 2:24:58.900\n You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat everyday\n\n2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:00.500\n when you have an ecosystem like this,\n\n2:25:00.500 --> 2:25:02.980\n cause you, you, the other thing is you're judged\n\n2:25:02.980 --> 2:25:05.420\n as much by the applications people build on the platform\n\n2:25:05.420 --> 2:25:08.200\n as you are by the platform you've constructed.\n\n2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:10.460\n So, you know, one of the most unfair things\n\n2:25:10.460 --> 2:25:13.140\n that happened in our industry was blaming Vitalik\n\n2:25:13.140 --> 2:25:14.500\n for the DAO hack.\n\n2:25:14.500 --> 2:25:16.440\n He didn't write the code, he wasn't responsible for it.\n\n2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:18.620\n It was a completely independent, different team.\n\n2:25:18.620 --> 2:25:19.580\n And because it blew up,\n\n2:25:19.580 --> 2:25:21.260\n a lot of people just developed this idea,\n\n2:25:21.260 --> 2:25:24.220\n Ethereum is not secure, the EBM is fundamentally broken.\n\n2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:25.880\n And it's true, there are some issues there,\n\n2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:28.160\n but come on, that's like saying,\n\n2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:31.420\n oh, well, Photoshop didn't work, fuck Bill Gates.\n\n2:25:31.420 --> 2:25:32.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:32.260 --> 2:25:34.820\n And that's the issue is you get,\n\n2:25:34.820 --> 2:25:36.640\n as a platform developer,\n\n2:25:38.060 --> 2:25:40.020\n coupled with the wins and losses\n\n2:25:40.020 --> 2:25:41.220\n of your application developer.\n\n2:25:41.220 --> 2:25:43.020\n So if they go do amazing things,\n\n2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:45.780\n it's like, oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it.\n\n2:25:45.780 --> 2:25:47.340\n And if they go do terrible things, they're like,\n\n2:25:47.340 --> 2:25:50.300\n oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us.\n\n2:25:50.300 --> 2:25:53.300\n So what we're kept up a night about\n\n2:25:53.300 --> 2:25:55.140\n is not just what we've constructed,\n\n2:25:55.140 --> 2:25:58.060\n but also how do we curate an ecosystem\n\n2:25:58.060 --> 2:25:59.740\n and foster the development of an ecosystem\n\n2:25:59.740 --> 2:26:02.060\n where you have assurance baked into the application,\n\n2:26:02.060 --> 2:26:04.380\n and that's somehow expressible to the user.\n\n2:26:04.380 --> 2:26:06.540\n So when you download your smart contract\n\n2:26:06.540 --> 2:26:08.040\n or you click your one click install,\n\n2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:09.780\n you use your unit swap clone\n\n2:26:09.780 --> 2:26:12.440\n or whatever the hell it is that's deployed on Cardano,\n\n2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:13.680\n you have a little green check mark\n\n2:26:13.680 --> 2:26:15.020\n or something that indicates to you\n\n2:26:15.020 --> 2:26:16.500\n that somebody audited the code\n\n2:26:16.500 --> 2:26:18.260\n or followed a specification.\n\n2:26:18.260 --> 2:26:19.940\n The lack of that is problematic\n\n2:26:19.940 --> 2:26:22.520\n because then first there's impersonations,\n\n2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:24.080\n the whole MyEtherWallet thing,\n\n2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:26.180\n like your videos or my videos are the same.\n\n2:26:26.180 --> 2:26:28.220\n Every comment, there's a bot that says,\n\n2:26:28.220 --> 2:26:30.780\n hey, give me some money or something like that.\n\n2:26:30.780 --> 2:26:31.880\n That kind of stuff happens.\n\n2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:34.060\n But then just protocol level flaws,\n\n2:26:34.060 --> 2:26:35.740\n like what happened with the DAO hack,\n\n2:26:35.740 --> 2:26:37.180\n that's what really keeps me up at night.\n\n2:26:37.180 --> 2:26:38.900\n How do you resolve that problem?\n\n2:26:38.900 --> 2:26:40.500\n Because I don't hire these people.\n\n2:26:40.500 --> 2:26:41.760\n I don't tell them what to do.\n\n2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:44.320\n I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform.\n\n2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:46.140\n They may have tons of experience and knowledge.\n\n2:26:46.140 --> 2:26:47.700\n They could be Simon Payton Jones\n\n2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:50.460\n or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever\n\n2:26:50.460 --> 2:26:51.540\n and they read one tutorial\n\n2:26:51.540 --> 2:26:53.860\n and they've written three lines of code their entire life\n\n2:26:53.860 --> 2:26:56.660\n and they've deployed something horribly broken, copy paste,\n\n2:26:56.660 --> 2:26:58.100\n and suddenly it all goes to hell.\n\n2:26:58.100 --> 2:27:00.120\n I'm judged by both.\n\n2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:01.620\n That's what really keeps me up at night.\n\n2:27:01.620 --> 2:27:03.620\n And we're, as a company, trying to figure out,\n\n2:27:03.620 --> 2:27:06.300\n and as the ecosystem, trying to figure out standards.\n\n2:27:06.300 --> 2:27:07.480\n Like at University of Wyoming,\n\n2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:10.500\n we're setting up the Smart Contract Engineering Institute.\n\n2:27:10.500 --> 2:27:12.020\n We're negotiating with them right now.\n\n2:27:12.020 --> 2:27:14.940\n And the goal there is just to create some standards\n\n2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:17.500\n for how to certify smart contracts\n\n2:27:17.500 --> 2:27:19.220\n so that you can get that green check mark\n\n2:27:19.220 --> 2:27:21.660\n and know that it actually has some assurance level\n\n2:27:21.660 --> 2:27:22.540\n behind it.\n\n2:27:22.540 --> 2:27:24.940\n But God, that's a huge coordination problem\n\n2:27:24.940 --> 2:27:27.120\n and it's a huge information presentation problem\n\n2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:29.060\n and incentives problem and so forth.\n\n2:27:29.060 --> 2:27:31.940\n And unfortunately, people who value being first to market\n\n2:27:31.940 --> 2:27:35.120\n will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else.\n\n2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:37.420\n In terms of, maybe you can comment\n\n2:27:37.420 --> 2:27:40.220\n on the topic of decentralized exchanges.\n\n2:27:40.220 --> 2:27:43.940\n What kind of decentralized exchanges, DEXs,\n\n2:27:43.940 --> 2:27:45.020\n what are they, first of all,\n\n2:27:45.020 --> 2:27:48.780\n and what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?\n\n2:27:48.780 --> 2:27:51.100\n Yeah, so people want to create exchanges\n\n2:27:51.100 --> 2:27:52.980\n that don't have custodial risk.\n\n2:27:52.980 --> 2:27:55.780\n The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace\n\n2:27:55.780 --> 2:27:58.340\n where bids and asks can find each other,\n\n2:27:58.340 --> 2:28:00.420\n people can meet and trade.\n\n2:28:00.420 --> 2:28:02.460\n You can find a price and you can get liquidity.\n\n2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:05.820\n So you got gold, you wanna turn your gold into dollars.\n\n2:28:05.820 --> 2:28:08.140\n Okay, well, somebody has to create a marketplace for that.\n\n2:28:08.140 --> 2:28:09.900\n So like Coinbase is an example of a marketplace.\n\n2:28:09.900 --> 2:28:11.260\n Exactly. But it's centralized.\n\n2:28:11.260 --> 2:28:13.100\n But the problem is you have custodial risk.\n\n2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:15.180\n So when you put your gold and your dollars\n\n2:28:15.180 --> 2:28:17.300\n or your digital representations of these things\n\n2:28:17.300 --> 2:28:20.660\n into the exchange, what if Wally,\n\n2:28:22.060 --> 2:28:24.300\n Eve broke up with him and now he's really sad\n\n2:28:24.300 --> 2:28:25.920\n and he's gone to the dark side\n\n2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:27.660\n and he's become Wally the hacker.\n\n2:28:27.660 --> 2:28:29.460\n Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in\n\n2:28:29.460 --> 2:28:32.080\n and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold\n\n2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:32.920\n and your tokens.\n\n2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:34.740\n So instead of you actually being able to swap these things,\n\n2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:36.340\n you've lost all your money.\n\n2:28:36.340 --> 2:28:37.420\n And there's other problems too.\n\n2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:41.460\n Like let's say Daisy has now come in\n\n2:28:41.460 --> 2:28:42.820\n and become a regulator and said,\n\n2:28:42.820 --> 2:28:44.380\n oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore.\n\n2:28:44.380 --> 2:28:46.140\n I'm just gonna shut them all down.\n\n2:28:46.140 --> 2:28:47.660\n Yeah, and then you have no access to it.\n\n2:28:47.660 --> 2:28:50.060\n So you have sovereign risk, you have the risk of threat,\n\n2:28:50.060 --> 2:28:53.020\n you have regulatory risk, you have the issue of banks\n\n2:28:53.020 --> 2:28:54.380\n maybe cutting you out.\n\n2:28:54.380 --> 2:28:57.280\n So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years.\n\n2:28:57.280 --> 2:28:59.560\n Mt. Gox was the most famous example of that.\n\n2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:01.940\n They collapsed, I believe in 2013\n\n2:29:01.940 --> 2:29:05.040\n and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost\n\n2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:06.580\n over the course of a while.\n\n2:29:06.580 --> 2:29:07.940\n So the point of a DEX is saying,\n\n2:29:07.940 --> 2:29:10.940\n can we do what a marketplace does,\n\n2:29:10.940 --> 2:29:15.100\n but not have Coinbase, not have a central actor\n\n2:29:15.100 --> 2:29:15.940\n run this thing?\n\n2:29:15.940 --> 2:29:17.540\n And there's a lot of problems with that\n\n2:29:17.540 --> 2:29:21.980\n because exchanges are generally creatures of latency.\n\n2:29:21.980 --> 2:29:24.260\n You know, high frequency trading, for example,\n\n2:29:24.260 --> 2:29:25.580\n the things that nanosecond,\n\n2:29:25.580 --> 2:29:27.580\n they co locate their infrastructure\n\n2:29:27.580 --> 2:29:28.860\n with the exchange software\n\n2:29:28.860 --> 2:29:31.420\n just so they can front run orders over other people.\n\n2:29:31.420 --> 2:29:34.500\n I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology that they put in.\n\n2:29:34.500 --> 2:29:37.460\n So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange\n\n2:29:37.460 --> 2:29:40.380\n is very centralized, very fast, very optimized\n\n2:29:40.380 --> 2:29:44.260\n and kind of behaves by a very closed set of rules.\n\n2:29:44.260 --> 2:29:46.300\n When you look at a DEX, you have to accept\n\n2:29:46.300 --> 2:29:48.940\n that you're gonna have to have slightly different rules\n\n2:29:48.940 --> 2:29:52.500\n because you're operating in a global systems latency\n\n2:29:52.500 --> 2:29:53.660\n and you're operating in a system\n\n2:29:53.660 --> 2:29:55.260\n that has different behaviors.\n\n2:29:55.260 --> 2:29:57.260\n However, that said, there's a lot of great protocols\n\n2:29:57.260 --> 2:29:58.100\n that have been built for it.\n\n2:29:58.100 --> 2:30:01.500\n You know, Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years\n\n2:30:01.500 --> 2:30:03.940\n and we've seen a huge competition\n\n2:30:03.940 --> 2:30:07.380\n and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols\n\n2:30:07.380 --> 2:30:09.060\n that kind of excuse some of these security problems,\n\n2:30:09.060 --> 2:30:10.540\n enjoy high liquidity\n\n2:30:10.540 --> 2:30:15.060\n and then also have this beautiful concept of openness.\n\n2:30:15.060 --> 2:30:16.500\n One of the gatekeepers to crypto\n\n2:30:16.500 --> 2:30:19.220\n when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges.\n\n2:30:19.220 --> 2:30:21.020\n I remember when we first created Cardano,\n\n2:30:21.020 --> 2:30:23.140\n you know, the Bitfinex guys\n\n2:30:23.140 --> 2:30:24.580\n reached out to the Cardano Foundation.\n\n2:30:24.580 --> 2:30:26.820\n They said, oh, we'd be happy to list ADA.\n\n2:30:26.820 --> 2:30:27.940\n And I said, okay.\n\n2:30:27.940 --> 2:30:30.940\n And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it.\n\n2:30:30.940 --> 2:30:34.220\n You know, so there was kind of some Italian for go fuck\n\n2:30:34.220 --> 2:30:36.620\n yourself in those email conversations.\n\n2:30:36.620 --> 2:30:39.060\n Fuck, hula is what I said.\n\n2:30:39.060 --> 2:30:41.780\n But anyway, that kind of back and forth\n\n2:30:41.780 --> 2:30:42.860\n happens all the time.\n\n2:30:42.860 --> 2:30:44.580\n And because these guys are gatekeepers,\n\n2:30:44.580 --> 2:30:47.540\n they have this nepotistic control information asymmetries\n\n2:30:47.540 --> 2:30:48.460\n and so forth.\n\n2:30:48.460 --> 2:30:50.700\n So having a DEX, you don't have that problem.\n\n2:30:50.700 --> 2:30:52.100\n You have open listing\n\n2:30:52.100 --> 2:30:54.380\n and you basically just put the asset into it.\n\n2:30:54.380 --> 2:30:56.860\n And if anybody wants to trade it, they will.\n\n2:30:56.860 --> 2:30:58.540\n And if it seems like it's a good idea,\n\n2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:00.700\n a natural market will form, market making will occur\n\n2:31:00.700 --> 2:31:01.980\n and you get liquidity with it.\n\n2:31:01.980 --> 2:31:05.140\n So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system.\n\n2:31:05.140 --> 2:31:08.700\n The biggest existential problem for DEXs right now\n\n2:31:08.700 --> 2:31:10.860\n is the concept of regulation.\n\n2:31:10.860 --> 2:31:14.740\n So basically right now, when you use Binance or Coinbase\n\n2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:16.980\n or these other guys, you have to go through KYC and AML,\n\n2:31:16.980 --> 2:31:18.940\n know your customer and anti money laundering.\n\n2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:20.780\n So basically who are you and you know,\n\n2:31:20.780 --> 2:31:22.180\n is your money real or not,\n\n2:31:22.180 --> 2:31:24.220\n or are you a drug dealer or something?\n\n2:31:24.220 --> 2:31:26.380\n So normally you do that by saying, okay,\n\n2:31:26.380 --> 2:31:29.100\n I'm gonna give them my copy of my passport\n\n2:31:29.100 --> 2:31:31.220\n and maybe they're gonna request some tax records\n\n2:31:31.220 --> 2:31:32.740\n or whatever the best practices are\n\n2:31:32.740 --> 2:31:34.580\n for the particular jurisdiction.\n\n2:31:34.580 --> 2:31:37.900\n And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up.\n\n2:31:37.900 --> 2:31:39.980\n So if the government comes in and says,\n\n2:31:39.980 --> 2:31:43.340\n hey guys, you know, pull your compliance records\n\n2:31:43.340 --> 2:31:44.620\n and they find discrepancies,\n\n2:31:44.620 --> 2:31:46.380\n they'll actually put the exchange out of business\n\n2:31:46.380 --> 2:31:48.380\n or fine them very heavily.\n\n2:31:48.380 --> 2:31:52.300\n JP Morgan Chase got $19 billion in fines\n\n2:31:52.300 --> 2:31:55.020\n over the last 20 years for various compliance issues\n\n2:31:55.020 --> 2:31:56.300\n amongst other things.\n\n2:31:56.300 --> 2:31:59.220\n So it's expensive, very difficult thing.\n\n2:31:59.220 --> 2:32:01.420\n And at DEX, it's open system.\n\n2:32:01.420 --> 2:32:03.660\n You just have value coming in, not identity.\n\n2:32:03.660 --> 2:32:04.980\n And so all these things are trading\n\n2:32:04.980 --> 2:32:06.460\n amongst anonymous accounts.\n\n2:32:06.460 --> 2:32:09.260\n And so there's no notion of compliance right now for that.\n\n2:32:09.260 --> 2:32:11.380\n So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying,\n\n2:32:11.380 --> 2:32:14.020\n oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism\n\n2:32:14.020 --> 2:32:15.340\n and drug dealing and bad stuff.\n\n2:32:15.340 --> 2:32:18.260\n And they're word salad of bullshit.\n\n2:32:18.260 --> 2:32:19.140\n But you know, it is what it is.\n\n2:32:19.140 --> 2:32:20.340\n You have to deal with these guys.\n\n2:32:20.340 --> 2:32:22.580\n And so there's been a lot of discussions of,\n\n2:32:22.580 --> 2:32:25.540\n can we take DEXs and keep the openness\n\n2:32:25.540 --> 2:32:27.140\n and keep the liquidity\n\n2:32:27.140 --> 2:32:29.820\n and no counterpart or custodial risk?\n\n2:32:29.820 --> 2:32:32.820\n And can we add some notion of compliance to that\n\n2:32:32.820 --> 2:32:33.980\n in a decentralized way\n\n2:32:33.980 --> 2:32:37.260\n that doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper?\n\n2:32:37.260 --> 2:32:39.140\n So I think actually by combining DIDs,\n\n2:32:39.140 --> 2:32:41.140\n decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it.\n\n2:32:41.140 --> 2:32:43.460\n But it's actually the next generation of the technology\n\n2:32:43.460 --> 2:32:46.300\n is the regulated DEX and who regulates that,\n\n2:32:46.300 --> 2:32:47.620\n how does that work and so forth.\n\n2:32:47.620 --> 2:32:48.980\n But I think ultimately those are gonna be\n\n2:32:48.980 --> 2:32:53.020\n the only marketplaces that end up surviving\n\n2:32:53.020 --> 2:32:54.140\n in this current environment\n\n2:32:54.140 --> 2:32:56.500\n if your desire is to exit to a dollar.\n\n2:32:56.500 --> 2:32:59.100\n If you don't really care about the fiat side,\n\n2:32:59.100 --> 2:33:01.020\n like a traditional legacy currency,\n\n2:33:01.020 --> 2:33:05.340\n you can always do things in a shadowy, unregulated way.\n\n2:33:05.340 --> 2:33:07.740\n But I mean, it's a personal preference\n\n2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:08.980\n and a business preference.\n\n2:33:08.980 --> 2:33:13.620\n Can we kind of return to proof of work and proof of stake?\n\n2:33:13.620 --> 2:33:15.780\n There's just so many topics I wanna talk to you about.\n\n2:33:15.780 --> 2:33:17.740\n So I'll jump around a little bit.\n\n2:33:17.740 --> 2:33:21.460\n But at the Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey spoke,\n\n2:33:21.460 --> 2:33:25.020\n I think I believe he said Bitcoin changes everything.\n\n2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:27.340\n I think he made a video for Jack\n\n2:33:27.340 --> 2:33:30.140\n trying to explain different ideas to him.\n\n2:33:30.140 --> 2:33:32.700\n I guess describing the difference between proof of work\n\n2:33:32.700 --> 2:33:35.100\n and proof of stake as we've talked about.\n\n2:33:35.100 --> 2:33:37.140\n What do you hope Jack Dorsey comes to understand\n\n2:33:37.140 --> 2:33:39.100\n about the difference between proof of work\n\n2:33:39.100 --> 2:33:40.660\n and proof of stake?\n\n2:33:40.660 --> 2:33:42.860\n Well, I hope he understands it's just a resource.\n\n2:33:42.860 --> 2:33:45.020\n That's the entire point of the video I was trying to make\n\n2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:47.380\n is like, dude, you're like in this cult\n\n2:33:47.380 --> 2:33:49.060\n where you think the only way to be secure\n\n2:33:49.060 --> 2:33:50.860\n is proof of worker and somehow proof of stake\n\n2:33:50.860 --> 2:33:52.900\n is less secure than proof of work.\n\n2:33:52.900 --> 2:33:55.420\n I don't even know how you put those inequalities there\n\n2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:57.660\n because you're talking about apples and oranges.\n\n2:33:57.660 --> 2:33:59.500\n You're making different trade offs\n\n2:33:59.500 --> 2:34:00.500\n and there's different assumptions\n\n2:34:00.500 --> 2:34:02.700\n about the nature of the people involved,\n\n2:34:02.700 --> 2:34:04.620\n but the mechanics are the same.\n\n2:34:04.620 --> 2:34:06.700\n And so it's really more of a question of\n\n2:34:06.700 --> 2:34:08.500\n what type of system do you prefer?\n\n2:34:08.500 --> 2:34:10.460\n Do you want mercenaries guarding Rome\n\n2:34:10.460 --> 2:34:13.100\n or do you want Roman citizens guarding Rome?\n\n2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:14.260\n Okay, and as the Romans learn,\n\n2:34:14.260 --> 2:34:16.860\n it's better to have citizens usually doing that.\n\n2:34:16.860 --> 2:34:19.300\n Okay, and that's the only point I was trying to make\n\n2:34:19.300 --> 2:34:22.500\n to Dorsey and I don't think he watched it\n\n2:34:22.500 --> 2:34:24.420\n or particularly cared,\n\n2:34:24.420 --> 2:34:26.660\n but it was more of a video for everyone.\n\n2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:29.380\n And to start that dialogue of realizing\n\n2:34:29.380 --> 2:34:31.260\n that the real game is not,\n\n2:34:31.260 --> 2:34:33.380\n is proof of stake better than proof of work?\n\n2:34:33.380 --> 2:34:36.420\n It's how do we go from one to end and what should end be?\n\n2:34:36.420 --> 2:34:38.700\n You just mentioned that semantical addressable web,\n\n2:34:38.700 --> 2:34:41.780\n going back to IPFS and these other concepts.\n\n2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:44.660\n Well, how do you pay for the enormous burden\n\n2:34:44.660 --> 2:34:46.220\n of storing that much data?\n\n2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:48.180\n You can create a consensus protocol for it.\n\n2:34:48.180 --> 2:34:49.020\n There actually is one.\n\n2:34:49.020 --> 2:34:51.860\n It's called Permacoin, came out in 2014, 15.\n\n2:34:51.860 --> 2:34:54.460\n Andrew Miller wrote it and a few other authors.\n\n2:34:54.460 --> 2:34:57.900\n I think John Katz may have been an author as well.\n\n2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:00.100\n But basically it was just a throwaway\n\n2:35:00.100 --> 2:35:02.020\n proof of work style algorithm\n\n2:35:02.020 --> 2:35:05.620\n that only works if you have large amounts of data.\n\n2:35:05.620 --> 2:35:07.460\n Okay, so it's like your miner\n\n2:35:07.460 --> 2:35:09.700\n is like a hard drive effectively.\n\n2:35:09.700 --> 2:35:11.220\n Proof of storage, I think you call it.\n\n2:35:11.220 --> 2:35:12.780\n Yeah, this type of stuff.\n\n2:35:12.780 --> 2:35:14.700\n And there's been since then many iterations,\n\n2:35:14.700 --> 2:35:17.020\n evolutions of that type of protocol.\n\n2:35:17.020 --> 2:35:20.220\n Okay, so what if you throw that into your resource back?\n\n2:35:20.220 --> 2:35:22.580\n Now you have a capacity in your system\n\n2:35:22.580 --> 2:35:24.900\n for storing huge amounts of information.\n\n2:35:24.900 --> 2:35:26.940\n That's incentivized by the way the system works.\n\n2:35:26.940 --> 2:35:29.300\n And you can balance that with a proof of stake system.\n\n2:35:29.300 --> 2:35:31.260\n And you can balance that with,\n\n2:35:31.260 --> 2:35:33.900\n let's say you have proof of useful computation.\n\n2:35:33.900 --> 2:35:37.380\n We may have a paper on that, who knows, coming soon.\n\n2:35:37.380 --> 2:35:39.340\n And what if you have a proof of useful computation\n\n2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:41.700\n where maybe you can do walk stat or something, who knows?\n\n2:35:41.700 --> 2:35:43.180\n With something like that, okay,\n\n2:35:43.180 --> 2:35:45.780\n well now you have three resources inside your system\n\n2:35:45.780 --> 2:35:47.740\n and those three things keep your system secure.\n\n2:35:47.740 --> 2:35:48.740\n They keep each other balanced.\n\n2:35:48.740 --> 2:35:50.300\n And they just so happen to create\n\n2:35:50.300 --> 2:35:53.060\n the world's largest supercomputer that's programmable.\n\n2:35:53.060 --> 2:35:54.260\n And it just so happens to create\n\n2:35:54.260 --> 2:35:56.700\n the world's largest database that's programmable.\n\n2:35:56.700 --> 2:35:59.620\n In addition to having a shareholder style model\n\n2:35:59.620 --> 2:36:00.740\n for ownership inside of it,\n\n2:36:00.740 --> 2:36:02.100\n to kind of balance these things out.\n\n2:36:02.100 --> 2:36:04.300\n So people care about the appreciation of value\n\n2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:05.500\n inside the system.\n\n2:36:05.500 --> 2:36:07.340\n So that was my point to Jack is,\n\n2:36:07.340 --> 2:36:09.780\n you're a business guy, why are you betting all your eggs?\n\n2:36:09.780 --> 2:36:13.100\n And one crazy model that's a cult step away\n\n2:36:13.100 --> 2:36:14.940\n and realize that that does something.\n\n2:36:14.940 --> 2:36:18.420\n It's a tool, but saws aren't the only tool in the toolbox.\n\n2:36:18.420 --> 2:36:20.780\n There's hammers and screwdrivers and other things.\n\n2:36:20.780 --> 2:36:22.140\n Go to end resources.\n\n2:36:22.140 --> 2:36:24.100\n And let's have a real conversation about\n\n2:36:24.100 --> 2:36:27.020\n what would a world computer or a world infrastructure\n\n2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:28.900\n that's useful for your business domain,\n\n2:36:28.900 --> 2:36:31.580\n in his case, Twitter, require?\n\n2:36:31.580 --> 2:36:33.220\n And what type of resources would you need\n\n2:36:33.220 --> 2:36:34.140\n for such a thing?\n\n2:36:34.140 --> 2:36:36.420\n Well, in this case, Square, more importantly.\n\n2:36:36.420 --> 2:36:38.260\n Currently, if you look at Square and Cash App,\n\n2:36:38.260 --> 2:36:41.100\n they support Bitcoin.\n\n2:36:41.100 --> 2:36:44.260\n He is kind of all in on the proof of work idea.\n\n2:36:44.260 --> 2:36:46.380\n Not all in, but currently kind of,\n\n2:36:46.380 --> 2:36:48.580\n that's the one supported idea.\n\n2:36:48.580 --> 2:36:51.180\n I guess there's not just a tip in proof of work.\n\n2:36:51.180 --> 2:36:54.260\n I love you so much, Charles.\n\n2:36:54.260 --> 2:36:57.500\n Thank you, I appreciate this.\n\n2:36:57.500 --> 2:37:00.220\n But I'm not gonna run with that,\n\n2:37:00.220 --> 2:37:02.220\n even though I'm tempted to.\n\n2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:05.980\n But looking forward, do you hope Cardano\n\n2:37:05.980 --> 2:37:07.860\n becomes part of Cash App?\n\n2:37:07.860 --> 2:37:10.540\n I mean, he's a business guy, or at least I'd hope he is,\n\n2:37:10.540 --> 2:37:13.020\n and it's not about what I want or what he wants,\n\n2:37:13.020 --> 2:37:14.620\n it's about what markets want.\n\n2:37:14.620 --> 2:37:16.660\n When you run a publicly traded company,\n\n2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:18.660\n you have fiduciary obligation to your shareholders\n\n2:37:18.660 --> 2:37:21.820\n to maximize the utility, sustainability,\n\n2:37:21.820 --> 2:37:23.460\n and value of your company.\n\n2:37:23.460 --> 2:37:26.500\n And so if he's running a company\n\n2:37:26.500 --> 2:37:28.340\n that makes money off of these things,\n\n2:37:28.340 --> 2:37:30.980\n it makes absolutely no sense to be a maximalist.\n\n2:37:30.980 --> 2:37:32.220\n You want transaction volume,\n\n2:37:32.220 --> 2:37:33.620\n that's how you make your damn money.\n\n2:37:33.620 --> 2:37:34.700\n Coinbase was the same way.\n\n2:37:34.700 --> 2:37:36.940\n They were very maximalist in the beginning.\n\n2:37:36.940 --> 2:37:38.420\n Very quickly, they started realizing,\n\n2:37:38.420 --> 2:37:39.940\n hey, we're losing a lot of money.\n\n2:37:39.940 --> 2:37:43.340\n If we wanna IPO, we kinda need to be a bit more diverse.\n\n2:37:43.340 --> 2:37:46.140\n Eric Voorhees was also a maximalist way back today.\n\n2:37:46.140 --> 2:37:47.780\n Now look at Eric, he's got ShapeShift\n\n2:37:47.780 --> 2:37:49.940\n and all these other pieces of infrastructure.\n\n2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:52.420\n He's a lot more friendly with us alties.\n\n2:37:52.420 --> 2:37:55.140\n So Jack will make that decision,\n\n2:37:55.140 --> 2:37:56.940\n his people will make that decision, I think,\n\n2:37:56.940 --> 2:37:59.300\n based on market dynamics, transaction volume,\n\n2:37:59.300 --> 2:38:01.540\n and value to the user.\n\n2:38:01.540 --> 2:38:04.660\n And if the concern is actually legitimately security,\n\n2:38:04.660 --> 2:38:06.660\n then the only question I'd ask their team is,\n\n2:38:06.660 --> 2:38:09.420\n can you please provide me a definition of what?\n\n2:38:09.420 --> 2:38:14.420\n Doing POW is more secure than proof of stake as a tweet\n\n2:38:14.900 --> 2:38:16.340\n is not really a proof, okay?\n\n2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:17.900\n You need to actually come out and sit down\n\n2:38:17.900 --> 2:38:19.460\n and say, what is your security model?\n\n2:38:19.460 --> 2:38:20.540\n What do you care about?\n\n2:38:20.540 --> 2:38:21.380\n What do you value?\n\n2:38:21.380 --> 2:38:23.940\n What's the problems you're concerned about proof of stake?\n\n2:38:23.940 --> 2:38:25.420\n And they never really get there.\n\n2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:28.420\n And that's why I call this maximalist like a religion\n\n2:38:28.420 --> 2:38:30.580\n because it's just like saying,\n\n2:38:30.580 --> 2:38:32.340\n the angels descended from the heavens.\n\n2:38:32.340 --> 2:38:33.260\n And it's like, well, how do you know?\n\n2:38:33.260 --> 2:38:36.180\n Well, because the Bible said so, or this doctrine said so.\n\n2:38:36.180 --> 2:38:37.540\n It's like, well, that's your evidence?\n\n2:38:37.540 --> 2:38:39.540\n Somebody wrote something down.\n\n2:38:39.540 --> 2:38:41.140\n Can you please give me a little bit more?\n\n2:38:41.140 --> 2:38:43.580\n They say, no, you're challenging the word of God.\n\n2:38:43.580 --> 2:38:45.980\n In this case, you're challenging the word of Satoshi.\n\n2:38:45.980 --> 2:38:48.340\n And all I ask for is just what is the burden of proof?\n\n2:38:48.340 --> 2:38:50.700\n We wrote the papers, we have security models,\n\n2:38:50.700 --> 2:38:52.060\n we went through the peer review process.\n\n2:38:52.060 --> 2:38:53.780\n God, that was not easy.\n\n2:38:53.780 --> 2:38:55.420\n We wrote formal specifications.\n\n2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:57.580\n In some cases, we formalize those specifications\n\n2:38:57.580 --> 2:39:00.900\n with Isabel, for God's sakes, which is not easy to do.\n\n2:39:00.900 --> 2:39:01.980\n And then we implemented it.\n\n2:39:01.980 --> 2:39:04.300\n And it's running in production with a million users\n\n2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:06.180\n at a $50 billion market cap.\n\n2:39:06.180 --> 2:39:08.940\n I mean, at what point do you start saying,\n\n2:39:08.940 --> 2:39:11.060\n well, maybe there's something there?\n\n2:39:11.060 --> 2:39:12.700\n And they say, no, there's nothing there,\n\n2:39:12.700 --> 2:39:14.300\n and it's not secure, it can't be secure.\n\n2:39:14.300 --> 2:39:17.220\n And you say, okay, then why do you believe what you believe?\n\n2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:19.900\n And they never come back to me with an answer, ever.\n\n2:39:19.900 --> 2:39:22.380\n Well, I believe God didn't go through a peer review process\n\n2:39:22.380 --> 2:39:23.620\n when he wrote the 10 commandments.\n\n2:39:23.620 --> 2:39:28.060\n So sometimes it works out, sometimes not.\n\n2:39:28.060 --> 2:39:30.060\n Let me ask on that same thread,\n\n2:39:31.100 --> 2:39:34.940\n Tesla, SpaceX, Elon Musk currently invested in Bitcoin,\n\n2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:36.460\n but are openly looking\n\n2:39:36.460 --> 2:39:39.580\n to explore other cryptocurrency investments.\n\n2:39:39.580 --> 2:39:41.940\n What case would you make for Cardano?\n\n2:39:41.940 --> 2:39:43.900\n Well, if they truly care about alternative energy\n\n2:39:43.900 --> 2:39:47.780\n and sustainability, carbon reduction or carbon neutrality,\n\n2:39:47.780 --> 2:39:49.860\n you can't be in a system\n\n2:39:49.860 --> 2:39:53.060\n where there is no built in mechanism\n\n2:39:53.060 --> 2:39:55.420\n to constrain the energy consumption.\n\n2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:58.900\n With proof of stake, energy consumption is a negative.\n\n2:39:58.900 --> 2:39:59.980\n You wanna minimize it.\n\n2:39:59.980 --> 2:40:01.740\n If you can get the same amount of stuff done\n\n2:40:01.740 --> 2:40:03.780\n on a Raspberry Pi as you can a big server,\n\n2:40:03.780 --> 2:40:05.220\n you're gonna do it on the Pi\n\n2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:07.100\n because ultimately that server cost\n\n2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:09.340\n and that energy cost is coming out of your budget.\n\n2:40:09.340 --> 2:40:12.020\n With proof of work, any innovation you come up with\n\n2:40:12.020 --> 2:40:16.300\n to optimize power, you just build more ASICs\n\n2:40:16.300 --> 2:40:18.780\n because it's always 30% more power efficient.\n\n2:40:18.780 --> 2:40:20.980\n Great, buy 30% more.\n\n2:40:20.980 --> 2:40:23.900\n You keep adding to the work set\n\n2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:25.380\n because you want more hash power,\n\n2:40:25.380 --> 2:40:27.860\n more hash power, more share of the Pi.\n\n2:40:27.860 --> 2:40:30.180\n So you have no energy savings component.\n\n2:40:30.180 --> 2:40:31.020\n I know these people are saying,\n\n2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:33.500\n well, there's a lot of wasted energy in the grid\n\n2:40:33.500 --> 2:40:35.700\n and this is kind of incentivizing\n\n2:40:35.700 --> 2:40:37.300\n using that wasted energy\n\n2:40:37.300 --> 2:40:39.460\n and it's a better way of storing it than batteries\n\n2:40:39.460 --> 2:40:41.140\n because you're now storing it as a Bitcoin\n\n2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:42.620\n instead of storing it as energy.\n\n2:40:42.620 --> 2:40:44.660\n Okay, maybe there's some truth to that,\n\n2:40:44.660 --> 2:40:47.740\n but anyway, it's just...\n\n2:40:47.740 --> 2:40:50.140\n The energy is a critical point for you.\n\n2:40:50.140 --> 2:40:50.980\n Like the...\n\n2:40:50.980 --> 2:40:52.540\n Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n2:40:52.540 --> 2:40:55.740\n The energy is a critical point for me with Tesla\n\n2:40:55.740 --> 2:40:58.940\n because they assert to be an alternative energy company.\n\n2:40:58.940 --> 2:41:00.660\n And unless they can make the case\n\n2:41:00.660 --> 2:41:02.300\n that somehow the proliferation of Bitcoin\n\n2:41:02.300 --> 2:41:04.460\n is legitimately going to proliferate batteries,\n\n2:41:04.460 --> 2:41:06.940\n solar and wind or other things,\n\n2:41:06.940 --> 2:41:09.300\n then it's probably good for them to just focus\n\n2:41:09.300 --> 2:41:11.020\n on the most efficient,\n\n2:41:11.020 --> 2:41:13.140\n energy efficient cryptocurrency possible.\n\n2:41:13.140 --> 2:41:15.300\n Otherwise you're exacerbating global warming,\n\n2:41:15.300 --> 2:41:18.180\n you're exacerbating the ecological consequences of it.\n\n2:41:18.180 --> 2:41:20.380\n The other thing is Bitcoin is the least programmable\n\n2:41:20.380 --> 2:41:21.700\n of all the cryptocurrencies.\n\n2:41:21.700 --> 2:41:24.300\n And if you wanna do interesting, sexy, unique things,\n\n2:41:24.300 --> 2:41:26.540\n let's say Tesla, for example,\n\n2:41:26.540 --> 2:41:28.460\n they wanna start doing V to I and V to V\n\n2:41:28.460 --> 2:41:30.900\n for autonomous vehicles\n\n2:41:30.900 --> 2:41:32.540\n and have the vehicles start talking to each other\n\n2:41:32.540 --> 2:41:33.940\n and connect it to 5G.\n\n2:41:33.940 --> 2:41:35.820\n Well, imagine if you wanna build a telco coin\n\n2:41:35.820 --> 2:41:37.700\n or some sort of 5G coin\n\n2:41:37.700 --> 2:41:40.380\n and you wanna build an IOT layer network,\n\n2:41:40.380 --> 2:41:42.860\n there's just no real way to do that on Bitcoin\n\n2:41:42.860 --> 2:41:44.180\n with the way it's designed.\n\n2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:46.500\n So you'd need fundamentally different infrastructure\n\n2:41:46.500 --> 2:41:49.500\n to create such a token and regulate such a system\n\n2:41:49.500 --> 2:41:52.020\n and have these things autonomously negotiate\n\n2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:52.940\n and do business with each other.\n\n2:41:52.940 --> 2:41:56.380\n You need DEXs and stable coins and all kinds of mechanics\n\n2:41:56.380 --> 2:41:58.380\n to make something like that possible.\n\n2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:00.180\n Well, that's really beneficial to Tesla\n\n2:42:00.180 --> 2:42:01.620\n if they could figure that out\n\n2:42:01.620 --> 2:42:02.460\n because they could create\n\n2:42:02.460 --> 2:42:04.340\n like an information sharing incentive scheme\n\n2:42:04.340 --> 2:42:05.700\n where if the cars talk to each other,\n\n2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:08.900\n including other branded cars, like GM cars and Fords,\n\n2:42:08.900 --> 2:42:10.940\n they can now actually get data from those cars\n\n2:42:10.940 --> 2:42:12.540\n through a marketplace in exchange\n\n2:42:12.540 --> 2:42:14.420\n for the benefit of autonomous driving\n\n2:42:14.420 --> 2:42:16.380\n or for the benefit of understanding road conditions\n\n2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:18.220\n or safety enhancement and so forth.\n\n2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:20.620\n So it's just depending, are you just here to speculate?\n\n2:42:20.620 --> 2:42:23.660\n Are you here to actually use it as another medium of exchange\n\n2:42:23.660 --> 2:42:25.540\n or do you actually wanna build infrastructure\n\n2:42:25.540 --> 2:42:26.420\n on this thing?\n\n2:42:26.420 --> 2:42:29.060\n The more closely you get to utility,\n\n2:42:29.060 --> 2:42:31.300\n the further down the road you get there,\n\n2:42:31.300 --> 2:42:33.700\n then the more programmability you need.\n\n2:42:33.700 --> 2:42:36.260\n And so it makes a lot more sense to be an Ethereum fan\n\n2:42:36.260 --> 2:42:38.900\n or a Cardano fan than to be a Bitcoin fan.\n\n2:42:38.900 --> 2:42:40.780\n So to be both proof of stake\n\n2:42:40.780 --> 2:42:42.740\n and have the smart contracts capabilities.\n\n2:42:42.740 --> 2:42:43.980\n Yes.\n\n2:42:43.980 --> 2:42:45.340\n And that's why we went over to Ethereum\n\n2:42:45.340 --> 2:42:46.860\n because they're proof of work.\n\n2:42:47.820 --> 2:42:51.060\n You mentioned God, God spelled backwards as dog.\n\n2:42:52.300 --> 2:42:53.980\n How's that for a transition?\n\n2:42:53.980 --> 2:42:58.980\n And Elon Musk and Tesla are at least a little bit curious\n\n2:42:59.060 --> 2:43:02.460\n about a coin called Dogecoin.\n\n2:43:02.460 --> 2:43:04.340\n You made a video directed to Elon\n\n2:43:04.340 --> 2:43:06.300\n on how to improve Dogecoin.\n\n2:43:06.300 --> 2:43:10.740\n What are your ideas for making Dogecoin even better\n\n2:43:10.740 --> 2:43:12.020\n than it already is?\n\n2:43:12.900 --> 2:43:14.540\n Well, Dogecoin is just based,\n\n2:43:14.540 --> 2:43:16.460\n it's like that Nine Inch Nails song,\n\n2:43:16.460 --> 2:43:18.020\n a copy of a copy of a copy.\n\n2:43:18.020 --> 2:43:19.540\n Yeah, it's just a copy of a copy.\n\n2:43:19.540 --> 2:43:22.540\n It's a Bitcoin gave Litecoin Litecoin.\n\n2:43:22.540 --> 2:43:25.060\n Bitcoin gave Litecoin Litecoin gave Dogecoin.\n\n2:43:25.060 --> 2:43:26.820\n And it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency.\n\n2:43:26.820 --> 2:43:28.540\n And I think Jackson was trying to do it\n\n2:43:28.540 --> 2:43:30.380\n to like prove a point about altcoins.\n\n2:43:30.380 --> 2:43:33.540\n And then true to form, it's like nobody got the doctrine\n\n2:43:33.540 --> 2:43:35.500\n and completely perverted the entire religion.\n\n2:43:35.500 --> 2:43:37.900\n It's almost like the emperor of man and Warhammer 40K.\n\n2:43:37.900 --> 2:43:39.660\n It was like this atheist don't worship me.\n\n2:43:39.660 --> 2:43:41.220\n And now there's like this whole religion\n\n2:43:41.220 --> 2:43:42.740\n built around the emperor.\n\n2:43:42.740 --> 2:43:44.940\n So Dogecoin has become a thing\n\n2:43:44.940 --> 2:43:46.660\n and it's become such a large thing\n\n2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:49.140\n that it is a reasonable target for somebody\n\n2:43:49.140 --> 2:43:50.420\n to fix it up and repair it,\n\n2:43:50.420 --> 2:43:52.580\n make it an interesting cryptocurrency.\n\n2:43:52.580 --> 2:43:54.460\n The point of the video was to show\n\n2:43:54.460 --> 2:43:56.540\n what a modern third generation cryptocurrency\n\n2:43:56.540 --> 2:43:57.820\n really would require.\n\n2:43:57.820 --> 2:43:59.020\n It's a major overhaul.\n\n2:43:59.020 --> 2:44:01.100\n And there are already people doing this.\n\n2:44:01.100 --> 2:44:03.380\n There's the Solanas and the Harmony Ones\n\n2:44:03.380 --> 2:44:05.580\n and the Cardanos, Neoses and all these other guys.\n\n2:44:05.580 --> 2:44:08.340\n And they have billions of dollars and huge dev teams\n\n2:44:08.340 --> 2:44:10.020\n and all these innovative protocols.\n\n2:44:10.020 --> 2:44:11.620\n If you're really serious about this thing,\n\n2:44:11.620 --> 2:44:15.300\n sticking around, being useful in doing stuff,\n\n2:44:15.300 --> 2:44:16.820\n then the point of the video was to show\n\n2:44:16.820 --> 2:44:18.860\n the types of things you'd have to think about\n\n2:44:18.860 --> 2:44:21.380\n and the types of papers that are all open source,\n\n2:44:21.380 --> 2:44:23.700\n patent free and don't have any notion\n\n2:44:23.700 --> 2:44:25.140\n of intellectual property behind them\n\n2:44:25.140 --> 2:44:28.140\n that his engineers could grab and go and do.\n\n2:44:28.140 --> 2:44:29.940\n And he did mention on Twitter\n\n2:44:29.940 --> 2:44:32.660\n that he was looking for feedback on how to improve Doge.\n\n2:44:32.660 --> 2:44:33.500\n And so I said, all right,\n\n2:44:33.500 --> 2:44:35.500\n well, I'll just put all these things together.\n\n2:44:35.500 --> 2:44:36.660\n It was a little tongue in cheek\n\n2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:38.660\n because I figured he'd ignore it,\n\n2:44:38.660 --> 2:44:41.220\n but it was also showing how hard it is\n\n2:44:41.220 --> 2:44:43.180\n to innovate in this entire space.\n\n2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:44.380\n You don't just go and say,\n\n2:44:44.380 --> 2:44:46.540\n I'm gonna go build a battery powered car\n\n2:44:46.540 --> 2:44:48.500\n or rocket or enter a new industry.\n\n2:44:48.500 --> 2:44:49.980\n It's really hard to do that.\n\n2:44:49.980 --> 2:44:52.220\n You spend years and lots of effort.\n\n2:44:52.220 --> 2:44:54.540\n You have to do series of small learning steps.\n\n2:44:54.540 --> 2:44:56.420\n You have to pick up destroyed rockets\n\n2:44:56.420 --> 2:44:58.220\n on the side of the beach and things like that\n\n2:44:58.220 --> 2:45:00.860\n before you get to the rocket landing itself.\n\n2:45:00.860 --> 2:45:01.860\n Well, analogously,\n\n2:45:01.860 --> 2:45:04.860\n it's really hard to build a cryptocurrency.\n\n2:45:04.860 --> 2:45:08.420\n Satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully\n\n2:45:08.420 --> 2:45:11.420\n and that work was a derivative of 30 years of work\n\n2:45:11.420 --> 2:45:13.900\n in the digital asset space starting in the 1980s,\n\n2:45:13.900 --> 2:45:15.380\n working its way through.\n\n2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:18.500\n So, and then Bitcoin only did very limited things\n\n2:45:18.500 --> 2:45:20.100\n relative to what Ethereum can do\n\n2:45:20.100 --> 2:45:22.100\n or Cardano can do and so forth.\n\n2:45:22.100 --> 2:45:24.420\n So the minute that you extend that complexity,\n\n2:45:24.420 --> 2:45:26.140\n you're talking about years of R&D,\n\n2:45:26.140 --> 2:45:28.660\n years of engineering effort that needs to be done.\n\n2:45:28.660 --> 2:45:30.140\n So what's the point of Doge?\n\n2:45:30.140 --> 2:45:32.140\n Is it just a meme?\n\n2:45:32.140 --> 2:45:34.500\n Is it actually contending to be useful?\n\n2:45:34.500 --> 2:45:37.860\n Or is it competing as a store of value against Bitcoin?\n\n2:45:37.860 --> 2:45:39.820\n Now, if it's competing as a store of value against Bitcoin,\n\n2:45:39.820 --> 2:45:42.740\n why the hell does it have the monetary policy it does?\n\n2:45:42.740 --> 2:45:44.540\n Also, there's predatory distribution\n\n2:45:44.540 --> 2:45:45.700\n of the underlying asset.\n\n2:45:45.700 --> 2:45:48.020\n Over 90 some percent is consolidated,\n\n2:45:48.020 --> 2:45:50.740\n less than 1% of the holders for Dogecoin\n\n2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:52.820\n at a very, very low price point.\n\n2:45:52.820 --> 2:45:55.020\n So they can sell at almost any price point\n\n2:45:55.020 --> 2:45:56.340\n and make a profit.\n\n2:45:56.340 --> 2:45:59.140\n So it hits 50 cents, they're billionaires\n\n2:45:59.140 --> 2:46:02.580\n and it's not like 20,000 people.\n\n2:46:02.580 --> 2:46:04.340\n It's probably less than 100 wallets\n\n2:46:04.340 --> 2:46:05.780\n that have that distribution.\n\n2:46:05.780 --> 2:46:07.820\n So there's this existential ticking time bomb\n\n2:46:07.820 --> 2:46:10.500\n that's in Doge that once the guys who are invested\n\n2:46:10.500 --> 2:46:12.580\n start selling, they can just keep selling\n\n2:46:12.580 --> 2:46:14.300\n and keep selling and ride it all the way down\n\n2:46:14.300 --> 2:46:15.860\n and make windfall profits regardless\n\n2:46:15.860 --> 2:46:16.700\n of what price they sell at.\n\n2:46:16.700 --> 2:46:18.060\n And who are they selling against?\n\n2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:19.220\n The retail investors.\n\n2:46:20.660 --> 2:46:23.900\n People make $500, spare money a month\n\n2:46:23.900 --> 2:46:25.060\n or something like that.\n\n2:46:25.060 --> 2:46:27.540\n And it bothers me because I see it in my community.\n\n2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:29.860\n So I live in Longmont, Colorado,\n\n2:46:29.860 --> 2:46:32.700\n and I was at a restaurant and I was talking to the waitress\n\n2:46:32.700 --> 2:46:34.260\n and she asked me what business I was in.\n\n2:46:34.260 --> 2:46:35.740\n I said, I'm in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n2:46:35.740 --> 2:46:36.780\n And she's like, what is that?\n\n2:46:36.780 --> 2:46:37.860\n And I started explaining all of it.\n\n2:46:37.860 --> 2:46:41.300\n And she goes, oh, yeah, I own some Dogecoin.\n\n2:46:41.300 --> 2:46:42.580\n I said, you own anything else?\n\n2:46:42.580 --> 2:46:43.820\n No, no, I just bought some Doge.\n\n2:46:43.820 --> 2:46:44.740\n Why did you buy Doge?\n\n2:46:44.740 --> 2:46:46.980\n Oh, I saw Elon tweeting about it\n\n2:46:46.980 --> 2:46:48.940\n and I thought it was a good deal.\n\n2:46:48.940 --> 2:46:50.540\n So when you see stuff like that\n\n2:46:50.540 --> 2:46:52.500\n where people have no clue what they're doing,\n\n2:46:52.500 --> 2:46:55.020\n they don't really understand the supply dynamics,\n\n2:46:55.020 --> 2:46:57.380\n the ownership dynamics and these types of things.\n\n2:46:57.380 --> 2:47:00.260\n And then when the clock stops,\n\n2:47:00.260 --> 2:47:02.020\n they're the ones who get hurt.\n\n2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:03.260\n And then the regulator comes in,\n\n2:47:03.260 --> 2:47:04.660\n the Elizabeth Warrens of the world,\n\n2:47:04.660 --> 2:47:06.620\n and they say, see, this is an evidence\n\n2:47:06.620 --> 2:47:09.220\n these guys can't regulate themselves, control themselves.\n\n2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:10.860\n We need to control everything.\n\n2:47:10.860 --> 2:47:13.060\n Either let's ban it or let's just announce\n\n2:47:13.060 --> 2:47:14.580\n that the only three are legitimate\n\n2:47:14.580 --> 2:47:16.780\n and every one of them has to be connected\n\n2:47:16.780 --> 2:47:18.780\n to identity and rah, rah, rah.\n\n2:47:18.780 --> 2:47:22.220\n And I'm just very concerned that that's a bad thing to do.\n\n2:47:22.220 --> 2:47:24.860\n And that's why I've been so vocal about this topic.\n\n2:47:24.860 --> 2:47:27.740\n And my hope is that a compromise can be made\n\n2:47:27.740 --> 2:47:30.580\n where real developers come in and they start working on Doge\n\n2:47:30.580 --> 2:47:32.300\n and they find a way to create some sort of use\n\n2:47:32.300 --> 2:47:33.460\n and utility for it.\n\n2:47:33.460 --> 2:47:37.300\n So at least it has a value floor and it won't collapse.\n\n2:47:37.300 --> 2:47:39.420\n Is it possible for Cardano and Dogecoin\n\n2:47:39.420 --> 2:47:40.740\n to work together somehow?\n\n2:47:40.740 --> 2:47:42.740\n Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun.\n\n2:47:42.740 --> 2:47:45.660\n I'm not adverse to the idea of cleaning up the code base,\n\n2:47:45.660 --> 2:47:47.940\n but legitimately, whoever comes in,\n\n2:47:47.940 --> 2:47:50.500\n be two years or three years of work,\n\n2:47:50.500 --> 2:47:51.860\n because you have to do real stuff.\n\n2:47:51.860 --> 2:47:56.740\n And that code is like Litecoin circa 2012, 2013.\n\n2:47:56.740 --> 2:47:58.540\n Well, the interesting thing about Elon,\n\n2:47:58.540 --> 2:48:00.380\n and I've got to interact with him quite a bit,\n\n2:48:00.380 --> 2:48:04.620\n that combination of humor and extreme ambition,\n\n2:48:04.620 --> 2:48:06.580\n like in the face of impossible odds\n\n2:48:06.580 --> 2:48:08.380\n is something he does really well.\n\n2:48:08.380 --> 2:48:12.220\n And so I think that's the spirit of Dogecoin\n\n2:48:12.220 --> 2:48:17.220\n is fun and almost like bold, ambitious innovation.\n\n2:48:19.300 --> 2:48:22.260\n And so I think you can't discount the power of that.\n\n2:48:22.260 --> 2:48:23.340\n But where's the innovation?\n\n2:48:23.340 --> 2:48:24.180\n What's the agenda?\n\n2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:25.220\n Well, this is step one.\n\n2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:27.620\n What's going to Mars for Dogecoin?\n\n2:48:27.620 --> 2:48:31.300\n Well, I mean, he came in the same way to Ruckus.\n\n2:48:31.300 --> 2:48:34.620\n He came in the same way to Electric Cars.\n\n2:48:34.620 --> 2:48:37.500\n It seemed impossible at first,\n\n2:48:37.500 --> 2:48:39.700\n but you step in and you solve the problems,\n\n2:48:39.700 --> 2:48:41.660\n first principles one at a time.\n\n2:48:41.660 --> 2:48:43.860\n But I'll tell you a little bit on this,\n\n2:48:43.860 --> 2:48:45.500\n because I think he had some trends\n\n2:48:45.500 --> 2:48:47.180\n that he was very smart to recognize.\n\n2:48:47.180 --> 2:48:48.420\n In the case of battery powered cars,\n\n2:48:48.420 --> 2:48:50.580\n he said, hang on, everybody has tablets and cell phones\n\n2:48:50.580 --> 2:48:51.460\n and these other things.\n\n2:48:51.460 --> 2:48:54.140\n And there's an incentive to make batteries better,\n\n2:48:54.140 --> 2:48:56.180\n faster, cheaper, and charge faster.\n\n2:48:56.180 --> 2:48:57.900\n And that's connected to mobile computing.\n\n2:48:57.900 --> 2:49:01.220\n So regardless if you want battery powered cars or not,\n\n2:49:01.220 --> 2:49:03.780\n every year you have billions of dollars of R&D\n\n2:49:03.780 --> 2:49:07.420\n being pushed to force this capacity to evolve.\n\n2:49:07.420 --> 2:49:08.780\n And he's just getting on the train\n\n2:49:08.780 --> 2:49:10.300\n and piggybacking on that.\n\n2:49:10.300 --> 2:49:12.940\n So that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize that.\n\n2:49:12.940 --> 2:49:15.500\n In the case of SpaceX, it was just an obvious question.\n\n2:49:15.500 --> 2:49:16.580\n If every time you get on a plane,\n\n2:49:16.580 --> 2:49:19.420\n you have to throw the plane away, no one would fly.\n\n2:49:19.420 --> 2:49:22.420\n So reusability is like a fundamental thing\n\n2:49:22.420 --> 2:49:23.740\n that if you solve that,\n\n2:49:23.740 --> 2:49:25.260\n you've now opened space up\n\n2:49:25.260 --> 2:49:27.940\n to a complete new class of commercialization.\n\n2:49:27.940 --> 2:49:29.940\n I don't see the problem in Dogecoin,\n\n2:49:29.940 --> 2:49:31.180\n because if he was looking for it,\n\n2:49:31.180 --> 2:49:33.100\n then why not look at a real platform\n\n2:49:33.100 --> 2:49:35.340\n actually trying to solve a real problem?\n\n2:49:35.340 --> 2:49:37.300\n There are so many of them.\n\n2:49:37.300 --> 2:49:39.700\n He can throw a rock, he can hit 15 of these guys\n\n2:49:39.700 --> 2:49:42.180\n and they'd all die to work with you at Musk.\n\n2:49:42.180 --> 2:49:43.220\n Yeah, that's very interesting.\n\n2:49:43.220 --> 2:49:45.940\n I mean, so first I could continue pushing back\n\n2:49:45.940 --> 2:49:48.740\n on your intuition about electric cars\n\n2:49:48.740 --> 2:49:49.580\n and batteries and so on.\n\n2:49:49.580 --> 2:49:51.980\n I don't think it's more obvious in retrospect\n\n2:49:51.980 --> 2:49:55.180\n than it is at the time, I would say,\n\n2:49:55.180 --> 2:49:57.500\n because I would agree with you on the batteries front,\n\n2:49:57.500 --> 2:50:00.060\n I wouldn't necessarily agree with you with the electric car\n\n2:50:00.060 --> 2:50:01.140\n because first of all,\n\n2:50:01.140 --> 2:50:04.220\n nobody started a successful car company for decades.\n\n2:50:04.220 --> 2:50:05.580\n Well, but it was the loyalty,\n\n2:50:05.580 --> 2:50:08.500\n the EV4 guys or whatever it was with GM,\n\n2:50:08.500 --> 2:50:09.900\n they didn't wanna give them back\n\n2:50:09.900 --> 2:50:11.660\n when they hit the lease program.\n\n2:50:11.660 --> 2:50:13.540\n So there's some basic intuition\n\n2:50:13.540 --> 2:50:14.940\n that there is some hunger here,\n\n2:50:14.940 --> 2:50:17.220\n but it's not obvious that you can do it successfully.\n\n2:50:17.220 --> 2:50:19.780\n And with relaunching rockets for cheap,\n\n2:50:19.780 --> 2:50:22.820\n that sounds good on paper, but to do it well,\n\n2:50:22.820 --> 2:50:25.380\n NASA is spending way more money for this.\n\n2:50:25.380 --> 2:50:29.540\n And the Russians were assholes, not selling any rocket.\n\n2:50:29.540 --> 2:50:31.540\n Like you said, you have to do it all yourself from scratch.\n\n2:50:31.540 --> 2:50:33.140\n How do you build the team?\n\n2:50:33.140 --> 2:50:38.100\n How do you launch rockets when if you fail a few times,\n\n2:50:38.100 --> 2:50:39.500\n you're gonna go bankrupt?\n\n2:50:39.500 --> 2:50:41.060\n I mean, it's just business wise,\n\n2:50:41.060 --> 2:50:43.220\n I would rather build an app like Angry Birds.\n\n2:50:43.220 --> 2:50:44.700\n Oh yeah, yeah, he's got it.\n\n2:50:44.700 --> 2:50:45.540\n Launch rockets.\n\n2:50:45.540 --> 2:50:46.380\n You gotta give him credit.\n\n2:50:46.380 --> 2:50:47.500\n He's got boulders for balls.\n\n2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:49.460\n I'm good for that.\n\n2:50:49.460 --> 2:50:50.300\n That's a good picture.\n\n2:50:50.300 --> 2:50:52.260\n Yeah, thank you for that.\n\n2:50:52.260 --> 2:50:54.700\n But I don't, maybe that's what, I mean,\n\n2:50:57.020 --> 2:50:59.580\n I think there's not enough first principle thinking\n\n2:50:59.580 --> 2:51:00.820\n on the cryptocurrency side.\n\n2:51:00.820 --> 2:51:02.580\n I think I agree with you on that.\n\n2:51:02.580 --> 2:51:06.420\n But there's some aspect to which the seriousness\n\n2:51:06.420 --> 2:51:09.660\n of the cryptocurrency world is paralyzing.\n\n2:51:09.660 --> 2:51:14.380\n So in some way, the innovation that you spoke to\n\n2:51:14.380 --> 2:51:16.660\n requires taking risks,\n\n2:51:16.660 --> 2:51:19.060\n requires not taking everything so seriously,\n\n2:51:19.060 --> 2:51:21.260\n like being afraid to take those bold risks\n\n2:51:21.260 --> 2:51:24.140\n in the space of ideas, not in the space of financials.\n\n2:51:24.140 --> 2:51:29.140\n So in that way, I think that's one pro for Bitcoin\n\n2:51:29.940 --> 2:51:33.780\n is there's room, it's hungry for innovation.\n\n2:51:33.780 --> 2:51:35.220\n But I think Cardano in that same way\n\n2:51:35.220 --> 2:51:37.740\n is hungry for innovation, just like as you said,\n\n2:51:37.740 --> 2:51:41.700\n with some more rigor and formalism behind it.\n\n2:51:41.700 --> 2:51:45.020\n I mean, even Ethereum has a hunger for innovation.\n\n2:51:45.020 --> 2:51:47.900\n That's where Bitcoin is a little bit more,\n\n2:51:47.900 --> 2:51:50.140\n I would say conservative in terms of how much innovating\n\n2:51:50.140 --> 2:51:51.700\n they're willing to do,\n\n2:51:51.700 --> 2:51:54.300\n in terms of the incentives they built into the systems\n\n2:51:54.300 --> 2:51:57.220\n for the evolution of the cryptocurrency.\n\n2:51:57.220 --> 2:52:00.780\n But yeah, I mean, it's difficult to psychoanalyze\n\n2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:04.820\n why Dogecoin is the thing that excites Elon so much.\n\n2:52:04.820 --> 2:52:09.220\n But at the same time, there's some power to the fun.\n\n2:52:09.220 --> 2:52:11.380\n It sounds ridiculous to say.\n\n2:52:11.380 --> 2:52:14.460\n But the fun, this idea that\n\n2:52:17.220 --> 2:52:19.740\n the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.\n\n2:52:21.580 --> 2:52:23.700\n There could be something built into the physics\n\n2:52:23.700 --> 2:52:25.820\n of the universe that makes that true.\n\n2:52:25.820 --> 2:52:30.820\n Because the viral nature of fun has power.\n\n2:52:30.820 --> 2:52:34.380\n A fun has power.\n\n2:52:34.380 --> 2:52:35.980\n Well, it's a neuroscience thing.\n\n2:52:35.980 --> 2:52:40.660\n We like dopamine, we like these chemicals in our brain.\n\n2:52:40.660 --> 2:52:43.300\n And when we have fun, we want more of it.\n\n2:52:43.300 --> 2:52:46.060\n So you tend to gravitate towards work activities\n\n2:52:46.060 --> 2:52:48.660\n and play activities that are enjoyable to you.\n\n2:52:48.660 --> 2:52:52.380\n And it is nice sometimes to kind of come in\n\n2:52:52.380 --> 2:52:54.060\n and troll an entire industry.\n\n2:52:55.100 --> 2:52:56.980\n I can imagine he's probably at the time of his life.\n\n2:52:56.980 --> 2:53:00.780\n It's the same as like taking Tesla private at 420.\n\n2:53:00.780 --> 2:53:01.820\n That kind of stuff.\n\n2:53:01.820 --> 2:53:04.620\n And it's one thing when you do it with friends.\n\n2:53:04.620 --> 2:53:06.340\n It's another thing when you do it with the whole industry\n\n2:53:06.340 --> 2:53:09.020\n and it hurts people financially.\n\n2:53:09.020 --> 2:53:11.500\n And also I understand he hates short sellers\n\n2:53:11.500 --> 2:53:12.900\n and there's some things there.\n\n2:53:12.900 --> 2:53:14.300\n And I can't speak for him\n\n2:53:14.300 --> 2:53:16.300\n because I only know the guy from a distance.\n\n2:53:16.300 --> 2:53:18.220\n It's just, I live in this space\n\n2:53:18.220 --> 2:53:19.740\n and I have to deal with the consequences\n\n2:53:19.740 --> 2:53:20.580\n and clean up the mess.\n\n2:53:20.580 --> 2:53:21.820\n You feel the pain.\n\n2:53:21.820 --> 2:53:24.340\n Yeah, and this results in a regulatory event.\n\n2:53:24.340 --> 2:53:26.180\n It's like, I'm the guy who has to put on a suit\n\n2:53:26.180 --> 2:53:28.780\n and go to Washington and go and sit in a Senate inquiry\n\n2:53:28.780 --> 2:53:29.620\n and all this stuff.\n\n2:53:29.620 --> 2:53:32.380\n I'm the guy that just like laugh with his friends\n\n2:53:32.380 --> 2:53:33.980\n about how he crashed the crypto market\n\n2:53:33.980 --> 2:53:36.100\n and how easy it was to do it.\n\n2:53:36.100 --> 2:53:39.300\n And that's my only umbrage about this.\n\n2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:41.220\n On the other hand, if it brings a lot of cool,\n\n2:53:41.220 --> 2:53:43.700\n new, interesting things and people into the space,\n\n2:53:43.700 --> 2:53:44.700\n that's a net positive.\n\n2:53:44.700 --> 2:53:47.580\n And so it's not universally bad or universally good.\n\n2:53:47.580 --> 2:53:50.380\n And I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\n2:53:50.380 --> 2:53:53.820\n And so I'm really hopeful to see what comes about\n\n2:53:53.820 --> 2:53:55.260\n this recent surge of interest\n\n2:53:55.260 --> 2:53:57.660\n and if Elon actually puts his money where his mouth is\n\n2:53:57.660 --> 2:54:00.780\n and take some of his enormous engineering talent\n\n2:54:00.780 --> 2:54:03.380\n and capital and starts contributing\n\n2:54:03.380 --> 2:54:05.940\n and building something in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n2:54:05.940 --> 2:54:07.700\n Be really cool to see that happen.\n\n2:54:08.860 --> 2:54:11.220\n There's a bunch of different technical aspects\n\n2:54:11.220 --> 2:54:13.380\n I wanna ask you about on the Cardano side.\n\n2:54:13.380 --> 2:54:17.460\n So first maybe on the scaling side, what is Hydra?\n\n2:54:17.460 --> 2:54:20.420\n How does Hydra compare to other different ideas\n\n2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:22.660\n for scalability like rollups,\n\n2:54:22.660 --> 2:54:27.660\n main trade offs with respect to security, UX,\n\n2:54:28.140 --> 2:54:31.220\n and anything else you wanna talk about?\n\n2:54:31.220 --> 2:54:33.380\n You have to have a little bit more energy, Lex, come on.\n\n2:54:33.380 --> 2:54:34.740\n You know what I need?\n\n2:54:34.740 --> 2:54:36.580\n I need that Coke machine that you mentioned,\n\n2:54:36.580 --> 2:54:38.580\n the thing that converts water to cocaine.\n\n2:54:38.580 --> 2:54:41.460\n Water to cocaine from Director Bullock.\n\n2:54:41.460 --> 2:54:43.180\n We'll leave this in, right?\n\n2:54:43.180 --> 2:54:44.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:54:44.260 --> 2:54:47.660\n Isomorphic state channels, that's a great topic, right?\n\n2:54:47.660 --> 2:54:51.060\n There's a word salad of cryptographic terms.\n\n2:54:51.060 --> 2:54:53.500\n Whether lightning, Hydra, rollups, any of these things,\n\n2:54:53.500 --> 2:54:54.740\n really what you're trying to do is say,\n\n2:54:54.740 --> 2:54:58.900\n okay, if I do it on layer one, it's slow and expensive.\n\n2:54:58.900 --> 2:55:02.100\n What I'm gonna do is batch something somehow, some way,\n\n2:55:02.100 --> 2:55:04.240\n and then do it in a different system\n\n2:55:04.240 --> 2:55:07.220\n where it's fast and cheap.\n\n2:55:07.220 --> 2:55:09.480\n And what I'm doing with that is I'm losing\n\n2:55:09.480 --> 2:55:12.620\n some of the security guarantees of the base layer\n\n2:55:12.620 --> 2:55:17.060\n and admitting a slight higher degree of centralization,\n\n2:55:17.060 --> 2:55:20.260\n but then I get super fast settlement,\n\n2:55:20.260 --> 2:55:22.560\n I get super low cost transactions,\n\n2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:24.620\n and potentially I may even be able\n\n2:55:24.620 --> 2:55:26.600\n to get distributed computing.\n\n2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:29.240\n Meaning that instead of having the smart contracts\n\n2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:30.380\n run in a replicated system,\n\n2:55:30.380 --> 2:55:32.860\n they could run on a single node, like a stake pool,\n\n2:55:32.860 --> 2:55:35.940\n and their stuff is different from the other guy's stuff.\n\n2:55:35.940 --> 2:55:40.560\n So you go from a system of capacity of whatever it is\n\n2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:44.140\n to a system of N for the totality of all the stake pools.\n\n2:55:44.140 --> 2:55:48.200\n So basically Hydra is just the next generation of that.\n\n2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:51.220\n When you have the ability to tinker with the accounting model\n\n2:55:51.220 --> 2:55:54.380\n and the layer two solution is co designed\n\n2:55:54.380 --> 2:55:55.620\n with the layer one solution.\n\n2:55:55.620 --> 2:55:57.780\n So it's like what Lightning would have been\n\n2:55:57.780 --> 2:56:00.820\n had Lightning been co developed when Bitcoin came out.\n\n2:56:00.820 --> 2:56:03.460\n There would have been special provisions made in Bitcoin,\n\n2:56:03.460 --> 2:56:05.500\n specifically to accommodate Lightning,\n\n2:56:05.500 --> 2:56:07.220\n and it would have made it very easy for you then\n\n2:56:07.220 --> 2:56:09.460\n to move inside the system, outside of the system,\n\n2:56:09.460 --> 2:56:12.100\n and have security properties preserved,\n\n2:56:12.100 --> 2:56:15.360\n like availability, for example, or fraud resistance,\n\n2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:18.300\n say, oh, you can't steal the money or these types of things.\n\n2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:19.800\n Where things get really complex,\n\n2:56:19.800 --> 2:56:22.460\n and this is why Hydra's novel over Lightning,\n\n2:56:22.460 --> 2:56:25.660\n is when you wanna move beyond payments to state management.\n\n2:56:25.660 --> 2:56:26.940\n Okay, so payments are just,\n\n2:56:26.940 --> 2:56:29.480\n I wanna move between Alice to Bob as quickly as possible,\n\n2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:31.100\n as low cost as possible.\n\n2:56:31.100 --> 2:56:34.300\n So for example, I have a micro tipping application,\n\n2:56:34.300 --> 2:56:37.200\n like change tip on Twitter, or like a video,\n\n2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:38.220\n I'm watching YouTube video,\n\n2:56:38.220 --> 2:56:39.740\n like maybe this video in the future,\n\n2:56:39.740 --> 2:56:41.380\n and people really like it, and they click tip,\n\n2:56:41.380 --> 2:56:43.500\n and you get five cents or something like that.\n\n2:56:43.500 --> 2:56:46.620\n Okay, so that's an example of a perfect payment application,\n\n2:56:46.620 --> 2:56:48.660\n and that's great, but what happens\n\n2:56:48.660 --> 2:56:50.540\n when you actually have a rich smart contract,\n\n2:56:50.540 --> 2:56:53.440\n like a DEX, or you wanna do a video game,\n\n2:56:53.440 --> 2:56:55.640\n or something like that, you wanna run that off chain,\n\n2:56:55.640 --> 2:56:59.080\n but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens.\n\n2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:01.820\n So a state channel basically lets you do that,\n\n2:57:01.820 --> 2:57:04.020\n but it's a lot more complicated,\n\n2:57:04.020 --> 2:57:05.700\n and there's a lot more to think about.\n\n2:57:05.700 --> 2:57:09.040\n So Hydra basically just has in its design,\n\n2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:11.540\n a collection of ideas of how to do that.\n\n2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:15.220\n And the current paper is for a single head.\n\n2:57:15.220 --> 2:57:17.420\n The next thing you do is composition.\n\n2:57:17.420 --> 2:57:18.980\n So you go multiple heads,\n\n2:57:18.980 --> 2:57:20.980\n and there's a routing protocol between them.\n\n2:57:20.980 --> 2:57:22.700\n And then eventually create these tail protocols\n\n2:57:22.700 --> 2:57:24.340\n for when things get asynchronous.\n\n2:57:24.340 --> 2:57:25.900\n So instead of always being aligned,\n\n2:57:25.900 --> 2:57:26.900\n and always being available,\n\n2:57:26.900 --> 2:57:28.860\n what happens if they die for a bit,\n\n2:57:28.860 --> 2:57:30.140\n and then they come back?\n\n2:57:30.140 --> 2:57:31.980\n And you can create all kinds of guarantees\n\n2:57:31.980 --> 2:57:34.580\n that your funds won't be lost, or locked forever,\n\n2:57:34.580 --> 2:57:35.420\n or things like that.\n\n2:57:35.420 --> 2:57:37.820\n There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff.\n\n2:57:37.820 --> 2:57:40.560\n And basically the idea is leverage what Lightning\n\n2:57:40.560 --> 2:57:42.260\n has already achieved with Bitcoin,\n\n2:57:42.260 --> 2:57:44.700\n but then take advantage of the fact\n\n2:57:44.700 --> 2:57:46.920\n that you have a more expressive accounting model,\n\n2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:48.740\n and a more expressive programming model,\n\n2:57:48.740 --> 2:57:50.180\n so you can just physically do more,\n\n2:57:50.180 --> 2:57:52.260\n and you can put more crypto into that thing.\n\n2:57:52.260 --> 2:57:53.660\n Now contrast it with rollups,\n\n2:57:53.660 --> 2:57:55.240\n really that is just saying,\n\n2:57:55.240 --> 2:57:56.660\n you're gonna take some thing,\n\n2:57:56.660 --> 2:57:58.400\n batch a bunch of transactions together,\n\n2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:00.040\n and you're gonna generate a proof.\n\n2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:02.140\n And then what you can do is whenever you see\n\n2:58:02.140 --> 2:58:03.420\n some part of that history,\n\n2:58:03.420 --> 2:58:05.860\n you can check it against that proof that's rolled up.\n\n2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:08.680\n And they're closely related concept of recursive snarks\n\n2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:09.520\n that you'll see a lot.\n\n2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:11.620\n Things like the MENA protocol, or other things.\n\n2:58:11.620 --> 2:58:14.580\n And basically the idea is that whenever you see something,\n\n2:58:14.580 --> 2:58:16.860\n you can always generate two proofs.\n\n2:58:16.860 --> 2:58:19.420\n An existential proofs that the coins exist,\n\n2:58:19.420 --> 2:58:21.860\n and a non existence of a double spend.\n\n2:58:21.860 --> 2:58:23.580\n So you can always check those two properties.\n\n2:58:23.580 --> 2:58:27.020\n And the proof is verifiable in logarithmic time, ideally.\n\n2:58:27.020 --> 2:58:29.340\n So you can have giant amounts of data,\n\n2:58:29.340 --> 2:58:30.620\n but it's very small.\n\n2:58:30.620 --> 2:58:33.140\n The actual proof is concise, okay?\n\n2:58:33.140 --> 2:58:35.700\n So they're just different boats for different floats.\n\n2:58:35.700 --> 2:58:38.600\n The advantage of a layer two network\n\n2:58:38.600 --> 2:58:39.940\n where there's actual channels,\n\n2:58:39.940 --> 2:58:42.560\n and there's interaction, and there's service providers,\n\n2:58:42.560 --> 2:58:44.420\n is the channels can eventually scale\n\n2:58:44.420 --> 2:58:46.660\n in the collection of things that they can do.\n\n2:58:46.660 --> 2:58:49.700\n And eventually they can become interoperability networks\n\n2:58:49.700 --> 2:58:51.380\n between cryptocurrencies.\n\n2:58:51.380 --> 2:58:53.960\n So at some point, we could modify the bolt spec,\n\n2:58:53.960 --> 2:58:56.380\n and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra.\n\n2:58:56.380 --> 2:58:57.880\n And then what you could happen is you could use it\n\n2:58:57.880 --> 2:59:00.140\n as a bridge to actually do cross chain traffic,\n\n2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:02.500\n and send transactions between the systems.\n\n2:59:02.500 --> 2:59:03.940\n You don't really think about that too much\n\n2:59:03.940 --> 2:59:04.960\n when you're talking about roll ups.\n\n2:59:04.960 --> 2:59:07.540\n That's more of optimizing what you have within the system.\n\n2:59:07.540 --> 2:59:09.980\n Within the chain, so can you elaborate\n\n2:59:09.980 --> 2:59:12.860\n how it's possible to do cross chain traffic?\n\n2:59:12.860 --> 2:59:14.100\n Well, you already have the intermediary,\n\n2:59:14.100 --> 2:59:15.540\n you have the channel operator,\n\n2:59:15.540 --> 2:59:18.740\n and you already have lightning protocol, right?\n\n2:59:18.740 --> 2:59:21.700\n And you just build a dex that runs within that system,\n\n2:59:21.700 --> 2:59:24.300\n and they can swap assets, or you can do wrapped assets.\n\n2:59:24.300 --> 2:59:26.220\n So you lock it. So it would be like low cost?\n\n2:59:26.220 --> 2:59:28.060\n I guess you could just switch low.\n\n2:59:28.060 --> 2:59:30.060\n Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one,\n\n2:59:30.060 --> 2:59:31.020\n will let you batch the other.\n\n2:59:31.020 --> 2:59:32.420\n So if lightning works on Bitcoin,\n\n2:59:32.420 --> 2:59:34.080\n and Hydra works on Cardano,\n\n2:59:34.080 --> 2:59:35.840\n you can eventually bridge these two together,\n\n2:59:35.840 --> 2:59:37.740\n and create a way of moving back and forth.\n\n2:59:37.740 --> 2:59:39.380\n And the same things that make transactions\n\n2:59:39.380 --> 2:59:40.580\n in and out of that network cheap,\n\n2:59:40.580 --> 2:59:43.220\n will make creating wrapped assets cheap.\n\n2:59:43.220 --> 2:59:45.540\n At least on the Bitcoin to Cardano side,\n\n2:59:45.540 --> 2:59:47.400\n you can't create assets on Bitcoin.\n\n2:59:47.400 --> 2:59:49.860\n Another flaw of Bitcoin that they've never fixed.\n\n2:59:49.860 --> 2:59:52.540\n What's your thought about layer two technologies in general?\n\n2:59:52.540 --> 2:59:53.900\n Is there stuff you're excited about?\n\n2:59:53.900 --> 2:59:56.260\n We talked quite a bit about Lightning Network, Hydra,\n\n2:59:56.260 --> 2:59:57.900\n and these ideas.\n\n2:59:57.900 --> 2:59:59.820\n Do you think there'll be somebody that wins out,\n\n2:59:59.820 --> 3:00:01.740\n or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing\n\n3:00:01.740 --> 3:00:03.800\n that we just keep building different ideas,\n\n3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:05.540\n and they all interact with each other?\n\n3:00:05.540 --> 3:00:06.580\n It goes back to biology,\n\n3:00:06.580 --> 3:00:08.500\n that cell differentiation concept,\n\n3:00:08.500 --> 3:00:11.540\n is you have to build specialized tissue to do these things.\n\n3:00:11.540 --> 3:00:13.580\n The point of layer two is to extend the network.\n\n3:00:13.580 --> 3:00:15.380\n It's adding a foot, it's adding an arm,\n\n3:00:15.380 --> 3:00:18.260\n it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart, it's adding eyes,\n\n3:00:18.260 --> 3:00:20.420\n giving you additional senses, you have ears now.\n\n3:00:20.420 --> 3:00:21.980\n So when you add these layer two protocols,\n\n3:00:21.980 --> 3:00:24.040\n like Atala Prism is a perfect example of that.\n\n3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:27.300\n We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardano.\n\n3:00:27.300 --> 3:00:29.500\n It's a real bad deal to do that,\n\n3:00:29.500 --> 3:00:30.980\n because then China will come in,\n\n3:00:30.980 --> 3:00:32.900\n or US will come in and tell you how to do that.\n\n3:00:32.900 --> 3:00:34.420\n What you do is you build a layer two protocol\n\n3:00:34.420 --> 3:00:35.700\n that's blockchain agnostic,\n\n3:00:35.700 --> 3:00:37.420\n and then the user can decide\n\n3:00:37.420 --> 3:00:38.860\n when and where they need an identity,\n\n3:00:38.860 --> 3:00:41.220\n and then bring that identity into the system.\n\n3:00:41.220 --> 3:00:43.340\n And if you designed it right, when they bring it in,\n\n3:00:43.340 --> 3:00:45.380\n it's very easy, very fluid,\n\n3:00:45.380 --> 3:00:47.820\n and suddenly the experience enhances.\n\n3:00:47.820 --> 3:00:49.300\n Everything just gets better.\n\n3:00:49.300 --> 3:00:51.780\n Oh, wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things.\n\n3:00:51.780 --> 3:00:53.860\n They go from gray to green in the App Store.\n\n3:00:53.860 --> 3:00:55.020\n That's so cool.\n\n3:00:55.020 --> 3:00:58.420\n Or, oh, wow, now I can send to human readable addresses,\n\n3:00:58.420 --> 3:01:00.220\n because if I have an identity and you have an identity,\n\n3:01:00.220 --> 3:01:02.300\n we can alias them with some namespace,\n\n3:01:02.300 --> 3:01:05.620\n and now I sent a Lex instead of some\n\n3:01:05.620 --> 3:01:08.140\n horrible back 32 address structure.\n\n3:01:08.140 --> 3:01:10.980\n Okay, so that's really what you need to do with layer two\n\n3:01:10.980 --> 3:01:13.180\n is say, okay, each layer two protocol\n\n3:01:13.180 --> 3:01:14.220\n is meant to do something.\n\n3:01:14.220 --> 3:01:17.360\n Either it gives me payments, or lower cost smart contracts,\n\n3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:19.820\n or interoperability, or identity,\n\n3:01:19.820 --> 3:01:21.580\n and then it's a marketplace.\n\n3:01:21.580 --> 3:01:23.700\n So you should have blockchain agnosticism\n\n3:01:23.700 --> 3:01:25.060\n with your layer two solutions.\n\n3:01:25.060 --> 3:01:27.040\n And so you can mix and match\n\n3:01:27.040 --> 3:01:29.300\n and choose whichever collection of services you need.\n\n3:01:29.300 --> 3:01:31.580\n And that's actually how IT works these days\n\n3:01:31.580 --> 3:01:33.660\n with microservices and these other things,\n\n3:01:33.660 --> 3:01:35.460\n and cloud software, you know.\n\n3:01:35.460 --> 3:01:38.540\n Every firm is an aggregation of dozens of providers,\n\n3:01:38.540 --> 3:01:40.660\n and basically that composition of them\n\n3:01:40.660 --> 3:01:41.880\n is your software stack.\n\n3:01:43.020 --> 3:01:45.840\n Jumping around back to proof of work.\n\n3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:49.180\n What are non interactive proofs of proof of work?\n\n3:01:49.180 --> 3:01:50.020\n NIPOPOWS.\n\n3:01:51.740 --> 3:01:52.860\n NIPOPOWS.\n\n3:01:52.860 --> 3:01:53.700\n NIPOPOWS.\n\n3:01:53.700 --> 3:01:54.860\n NIPOPOWS, it's fun to say, right?\n\n3:01:54.860 --> 3:01:55.700\n NIPOPOWS.\n\n3:01:55.700 --> 3:01:57.180\n It's just one of those things that you notice\n\n3:01:57.180 --> 3:02:00.140\n that certain proofs of work, when you solve them,\n\n3:02:00.140 --> 3:02:02.060\n come up less frequently than other ones.\n\n3:02:02.060 --> 3:02:05.420\n And just by that nature, you can sample them\n\n3:02:05.420 --> 3:02:07.020\n and then construct proofs from them.\n\n3:02:07.020 --> 3:02:09.900\n So you can, with that just set,\n\n3:02:09.900 --> 3:02:11.980\n have a more concise representation\n\n3:02:11.980 --> 3:02:14.060\n of an amount of work for a range of the chain.\n\n3:02:14.060 --> 3:02:14.900\n So that works.\n\n3:02:14.900 --> 3:02:15.740\n Can you say that again?\n\n3:02:15.740 --> 3:02:17.580\n Yeah, I was gonna say that word salad,\n\n3:02:17.580 --> 3:02:20.980\n basically the idea is, okay, so let's say that this block,\n\n3:02:20.980 --> 3:02:22.900\n and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot.\n\n3:02:22.900 --> 3:02:27.140\n This block, you get a regular green type of proof of work,\n\n3:02:27.140 --> 3:02:28.680\n and then this block, you get a green,\n\n3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:31.500\n and you keep going, and then suddenly you get a red one.\n\n3:02:31.500 --> 3:02:32.960\n So it's still a valid proof of work,\n\n3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:35.780\n but it's more rare than the other ones.\n\n3:02:35.780 --> 3:02:37.580\n So if you notice that particular pattern,\n\n3:02:37.580 --> 3:02:39.240\n what you can do is you can just start\n\n3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:41.380\n not caring so much about the green ones,\n\n3:02:41.380 --> 3:02:43.700\n and you can just bookend your chain with red.\n\n3:02:44.900 --> 3:02:47.020\n And then you can just repeat that, and repeat that,\n\n3:02:47.020 --> 3:02:48.300\n repeat that, and you can collect,\n\n3:02:48.300 --> 3:02:50.780\n and you can create this really compressed representation\n\n3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:51.720\n of these things.\n\n3:02:51.720 --> 3:02:52.560\n So what does it mean?\n\n3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:54.980\n It means that suddenly when you have that,\n\n3:02:54.980 --> 3:02:58.340\n now you have a way of representing a long range of history\n\n3:02:58.340 --> 3:03:00.340\n with a very small proof.\n\n3:03:00.340 --> 3:03:01.900\n So you can use it for light wallets,\n\n3:03:01.900 --> 3:03:05.300\n and you also can use it for side chains,\n\n3:03:05.300 --> 3:03:07.740\n if both side chains use proof of work.\n\n3:03:07.740 --> 3:03:09.340\n So when you see a transaction come in,\n\n3:03:09.340 --> 3:03:11.140\n you don't have a copy of the side chain,\n\n3:03:11.140 --> 3:03:12.700\n but you have a copy of the proof of work,\n\n3:03:12.700 --> 3:03:14.940\n and it has the same algorithmic weight\n\n3:03:14.940 --> 3:03:17.460\n as the normal longest chain,\n\n3:03:17.460 --> 3:03:18.960\n because you don't have all the greens,\n\n3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:21.900\n but the reds only occur with a certain sampling frequency.\n\n3:03:21.900 --> 3:03:25.260\n So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zintros and Agelos,\n\n3:03:25.260 --> 3:03:27.020\n and it's just an amazing paper,\n\n3:03:27.020 --> 3:03:29.660\n and what's so cool about it is it doesn't require\n\n3:03:29.660 --> 3:03:31.460\n any structural changes to proof of work.\n\n3:03:31.460 --> 3:03:32.660\n It's just something you notice\n\n3:03:32.660 --> 3:03:34.380\n as an off gas of proof of work.\n\n3:03:34.380 --> 3:03:36.340\n It's like you're watching an engine operate,\n\n3:03:36.340 --> 3:03:39.120\n and you notice like every 500 times a piston\n\n3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:41.000\n will do a certain weird thing,\n\n3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:42.400\n and so you take advantage of that.\n\n3:03:42.400 --> 3:03:44.180\n You say, well, if I count 10 of them,\n\n3:03:44.180 --> 3:03:47.180\n now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes,\n\n3:03:47.180 --> 3:03:48.620\n as I observed that pattern.\n\n3:03:48.620 --> 3:03:50.380\n And so it's the same concept there,\n\n3:03:50.380 --> 3:03:52.540\n and it's just a property of the engine.\n\n3:03:52.540 --> 3:03:54.040\n So you don't really need to hard fork it in.\n\n3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:56.980\n It's just there, and because you can build proofs that way,\n\n3:03:56.980 --> 3:03:59.660\n now you can use those proofs to do like clients,\n\n3:03:59.660 --> 3:04:01.060\n and you can use those proofs to do other things,\n\n3:04:01.060 --> 3:04:02.540\n because you can just use that as something\n\n3:04:02.540 --> 3:04:03.380\n that comes with the history.\n\n3:04:03.380 --> 3:04:04.860\n You don't have to have the whole blockchain.\n\n3:04:04.860 --> 3:04:06.060\n Now, is this a weird property\n\n3:04:06.060 --> 3:04:08.460\n of multiple proof of work chains?\n\n3:04:08.460 --> 3:04:12.020\n It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm,\n\n3:04:12.020 --> 3:04:15.300\n but usually there's some portability in this type of thing.\n\n3:04:15.300 --> 3:04:16.420\n Like we're right now exploring,\n\n3:04:16.420 --> 3:04:17.980\n can you do NIPA piles with Prism\n\n3:04:17.980 --> 3:04:20.140\n or any of these sharded proof of work protocols,\n\n3:04:20.140 --> 3:04:21.380\n but it looks like you can.\n\n3:04:21.380 --> 3:04:23.520\n The closely related is log space mining.\n\n3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:25.300\n So you can use this concept,\n\n3:04:25.300 --> 3:04:26.860\n and instead of having the entire blockchain\n\n3:04:26.860 --> 3:04:27.820\n to be able to mine,\n\n3:04:27.820 --> 3:04:29.940\n you can use a compressed representation of it.\n\n3:04:29.940 --> 3:04:31.700\n We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining\n\n3:04:31.700 --> 3:04:33.700\n that basically explains how to do that.\n\n3:04:33.700 --> 3:04:38.140\n So your miner only has this very small micro ledger\n\n3:04:38.140 --> 3:04:40.420\n as opposed to the entire ledger.\n\n3:04:40.420 --> 3:04:43.020\n How does it connect back to the entire ledger?\n\n3:04:43.020 --> 3:04:43.860\n How does the compressed?\n\n3:04:43.860 --> 3:04:45.580\n Because you have those red blocks.\n\n3:04:45.580 --> 3:04:46.700\n You have those special things,\n\n3:04:46.700 --> 3:04:48.740\n and so you know that the state you're working on\n\n3:04:48.740 --> 3:04:51.060\n is actually legitimate, right?\n\n3:04:51.060 --> 3:04:52.860\n So the map goes both ways?\n\n3:04:52.860 --> 3:04:55.460\n Yep, it's pretty cool.\n\n3:04:55.460 --> 3:04:56.380\n Wow, that's really interesting.\n\n3:04:56.380 --> 3:04:58.580\n Yeah, and Denis is a genius.\n\n3:04:58.580 --> 3:05:00.040\n He's a really, really smart kid,\n\n3:05:00.040 --> 3:05:01.740\n and he got his PhD under us.\n\n3:05:01.740 --> 3:05:03.280\n He went to University of Athens,\n\n3:05:03.280 --> 3:05:05.340\n and he was Agelos's graduate student,\n\n3:05:05.340 --> 3:05:08.380\n and now he's doing a postdoc at Stanford under David Shi,\n\n3:05:08.380 --> 3:05:10.340\n and this is literally the only thing he does.\n\n3:05:10.340 --> 3:05:13.100\n He does interoperability, sidechain stuff,\n\n3:05:13.100 --> 3:05:14.580\n NIPA piles and so forth,\n\n3:05:14.580 --> 3:05:16.580\n and he's written a lot of great papers on it.\n\n3:05:16.580 --> 3:05:18.740\n And that was a testimony to hard work\n\n3:05:18.740 --> 3:05:20.100\n for getting the paper published,\n\n3:05:20.100 --> 3:05:21.820\n because the paper came out in 2016,\n\n3:05:21.820 --> 3:05:23.580\n but I think it took three or four years\n\n3:05:23.580 --> 3:05:25.500\n for it to go through peer review.\n\n3:05:25.500 --> 3:05:27.220\n He kept trying to push it one conference\n\n3:05:27.220 --> 3:05:29.420\n after another rejection, after another rejection,\n\n3:05:29.420 --> 3:05:30.900\n but he got it through.\n\n3:05:30.900 --> 3:05:32.220\n Real proud of that kid.\n\n3:05:32.220 --> 3:05:33.580\n And then he's just doing all this beautiful\n\n3:05:33.580 --> 3:05:37.020\n derivative work now, like lock space mining and so forth.\n\n3:05:37.020 --> 3:05:39.240\n So, Reddit.\n\n3:05:40.820 --> 3:05:42.260\n Any sentence that starts with Reddit,\n\n3:05:42.260 --> 3:05:43.640\n you know it's gonna be fun.\n\n3:05:43.640 --> 3:05:47.600\n The top question on the Cardano subreddit,\n\n3:05:47.600 --> 3:05:50.540\n which is quite a wonderful place, by the way,\n\n3:05:50.540 --> 3:05:55.240\n was can you get Charles to play devil's advocate\n\n3:05:55.240 --> 3:05:56.980\n against Cardano?\n\n3:05:56.980 --> 3:06:00.080\n If it's going to fail, what would failure look like\n\n3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:02.620\n and what are the most likely reasons it would fail?\n\n3:06:03.580 --> 3:06:06.620\n Okay, well there's the failure.\n\n3:06:06.620 --> 3:06:09.080\n For example, I said one of the project goals\n\n3:06:09.080 --> 3:06:11.200\n was to achieve self evolution.\n\n3:06:11.200 --> 3:06:12.620\n So if it doesn't achieve that,\n\n3:06:12.620 --> 3:06:16.080\n where it can evolve itself iteration by iteration,\n\n3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:19.220\n then obviously the product didn't do what was intended.\n\n3:06:19.220 --> 3:06:23.040\n If it continuously required the supervision of custodians\n\n3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:26.740\n in order for it to succeed, the system just won't work.\n\n3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:29.380\n The good news is we have a lot of data showing the opposite.\n\n3:06:29.380 --> 3:06:31.740\n You know, we used to run a federated model\n\n3:06:31.740 --> 3:06:33.220\n and now we're completely decentralized\n\n3:06:33.220 --> 3:06:34.460\n for block production,\n\n3:06:34.460 --> 3:06:36.380\n but that didn't just happen overnight.\n\n3:06:36.380 --> 3:06:38.460\n I mean, there was a whole process\n\n3:06:38.460 --> 3:06:40.020\n with the incentivized test net\n\n3:06:40.020 --> 3:06:41.840\n and the stake pool pioneers program\n\n3:06:41.840 --> 3:06:42.940\n and the launch of Shelley\n\n3:06:42.940 --> 3:06:45.580\n and the decrementing of the decentralization parameter.\n\n3:06:45.580 --> 3:06:47.200\n And every step of the way people showed up\n\n3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:48.360\n and had to do things.\n\n3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:51.620\n And we went from several to thousands of people\n\n3:06:51.620 --> 3:06:54.080\n who were regularly maintaining the infrastructure,\n\n3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:57.100\n but there's no guarantee that that would be sustainable.\n\n3:06:57.100 --> 3:06:59.900\n And there's no guarantee that the next step,\n\n3:06:59.900 --> 3:07:02.140\n the smart contract step will achieve what we want.\n\n3:07:02.140 --> 3:07:03.500\n And the next step, the governance step\n\n3:07:03.500 --> 3:07:04.780\n will achieve what we want.\n\n3:07:04.780 --> 3:07:06.860\n I mean, it's an experiment and all these types of things.\n\n3:07:06.860 --> 3:07:10.220\n All cryptocurrencies, all companies are in a sense,\n\n3:07:10.220 --> 3:07:12.980\n experiments when they are evolving the business model.\n\n3:07:12.980 --> 3:07:17.620\n And as our case, our businesses systems and society,\n\n3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:19.660\n we're offering to the world a vision\n\n3:07:19.660 --> 3:07:22.220\n of how to run humanity in a different way.\n\n3:07:22.220 --> 3:07:24.220\n And the only way the system can do that\n\n3:07:24.220 --> 3:07:26.580\n is by millions of people joining the system,\n\n3:07:26.580 --> 3:07:27.900\n self evolving the system\n\n3:07:27.900 --> 3:07:30.560\n and growing it in that particular direction.\n\n3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:33.900\n Another failure scenario would be the system evolves\n\n3:07:33.900 --> 3:07:34.900\n in the wrong direction.\n\n3:07:34.900 --> 3:07:36.160\n So it's self evolving,\n\n3:07:36.160 --> 3:07:39.620\n but it goes into a more centralized dystopian way.\n\n3:07:39.620 --> 3:07:41.380\n And that's problematic as well.\n\n3:07:41.380 --> 3:07:42.220\n What would that look like?\n\n3:07:42.220 --> 3:07:44.060\n What would dystopia,\n\n3:07:44.060 --> 3:07:46.320\n self evolution toward dystopia look like?\n\n3:07:46.320 --> 3:07:48.580\n A small group of actors have total control\n\n3:07:48.580 --> 3:07:50.140\n over who gets to use the system\n\n3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:51.540\n and how they get to use the system.\n\n3:07:51.540 --> 3:07:53.700\n And your use of the system is monitored\n\n3:07:53.700 --> 3:07:56.180\n and shared with that small group of actors.\n\n3:07:56.180 --> 3:07:58.980\n So social credit in China is a great example of that.\n\n3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:00.860\n A small group of people have access to that.\n\n3:08:00.860 --> 3:08:03.540\n And then your experience in Chinese society\n\n3:08:03.540 --> 3:08:04.660\n is determined by it.\n\n3:08:05.740 --> 3:08:07.740\n So that's an example of a failure mode.\n\n3:08:07.740 --> 3:08:10.700\n And then another could be just network effect.\n\n3:08:10.700 --> 3:08:13.220\n We start experiencing a churn rate\n\n3:08:13.220 --> 3:08:16.860\n and the inputs don't match the outputs\n\n3:08:16.860 --> 3:08:19.580\n and that you lose more than you gain.\n\n3:08:19.580 --> 3:08:21.820\n And then over time, the system dies off.\n\n3:08:21.820 --> 3:08:23.580\n However, that's really hard in practice.\n\n3:08:23.580 --> 3:08:25.460\n Once you reach a certain network effect,\n\n3:08:25.460 --> 3:08:28.020\n even if you become stagnant and stale,\n\n3:08:28.020 --> 3:08:29.580\n you tend not to lose your users.\n\n3:08:29.580 --> 3:08:32.360\n And our evangelism is unbelievable\n\n3:08:32.360 --> 3:08:33.420\n in the Cardano community.\n\n3:08:33.420 --> 3:08:35.700\n I think we're number one for tattoos.\n\n3:08:35.700 --> 3:08:37.300\n And if you think about that,\n\n3:08:37.300 --> 3:08:38.900\n it's a strange metric to have,\n\n3:08:38.900 --> 3:08:41.020\n but there are brands that associate that way,\n\n3:08:41.020 --> 3:08:43.180\n like Apple and Harley Davidson and so forth.\n\n3:08:43.180 --> 3:08:45.380\n People tend to actually tattoo the logo.\n\n3:08:45.380 --> 3:08:47.060\n Those people don't leave.\n\n3:08:47.060 --> 3:08:49.460\n They don't actually walk away from the ecosystem.\n\n3:08:49.460 --> 3:08:51.340\n They're fanboys to the core.\n\n3:08:51.340 --> 3:08:55.240\n So there's a lot of people that are here for life.\n\n3:08:55.240 --> 3:08:58.020\n They don't care if it's dollar ADA, two cent ADA.\n\n3:08:58.020 --> 3:08:59.880\n They believe in the mission, vision and value\n\n3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:01.180\n of what we wish to achieve.\n\n3:09:01.180 --> 3:09:03.300\n And they've become evangelists in that respect.\n\n3:09:03.300 --> 3:09:06.800\n So the question is, does that community sustain itself?\n\n3:09:06.800 --> 3:09:09.100\n And also does that community not make the same sins\n\n3:09:09.100 --> 3:09:10.580\n and mistake of Bitcoin,\n\n3:09:10.580 --> 3:09:12.940\n where they become toxic and maximalistic\n\n3:09:12.940 --> 3:09:14.660\n and they start becoming highly religious\n\n3:09:14.660 --> 3:09:16.220\n about whatever beliefs they have?\n\n3:09:16.220 --> 3:09:20.180\n My hope is our community will be open and Socratic\n\n3:09:20.180 --> 3:09:21.920\n and love the scientific method\n\n3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:25.240\n and be willing to entertain ideas without adopting them\n\n3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:28.060\n and discard ideas that are proven to be wrong.\n\n3:09:28.060 --> 3:09:31.380\n If we become dogmatic and embrace an orthodoxy\n\n3:09:31.380 --> 3:09:33.700\n that is a counterproductive innovation,\n\n3:09:33.700 --> 3:09:36.120\n then it'll stall out the ecosystem.\n\n3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:38.540\n And you'll notice I never said price in any of this.\n\n3:09:38.540 --> 3:09:42.580\n I never said, hey, failure is if the price goes way down\n\n3:09:42.580 --> 3:09:44.900\n and success is if the price goes way up.\n\n3:09:44.900 --> 3:09:46.960\n That's unfortunately the metric that most people use,\n\n3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:48.620\n but I couldn't care less about it.\n\n3:09:48.620 --> 3:09:51.340\n Because the reality is if you construct a system\n\n3:09:51.340 --> 3:09:53.520\n that encompasses the entire globe\n\n3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:55.100\n and has billions of users,\n\n3:09:55.100 --> 3:09:57.080\n it's probably gonna be a pretty valuable system.\n\n3:09:57.080 --> 3:09:59.380\n That's a secondary thing.\n\n3:09:59.380 --> 3:10:02.060\n It's an after effect of having success\n\n3:10:02.060 --> 3:10:03.640\n in adoption, use and utility.\n\n3:10:04.500 --> 3:10:07.780\n Unfortunately, most people on Reddit and Twitter\n\n3:10:07.780 --> 3:10:08.820\n and other channels,\n\n3:10:08.820 --> 3:10:11.500\n they tend to just judge your entire success based on that.\n\n3:10:11.500 --> 3:10:13.840\n I had very few people when Shelley launched,\n\n3:10:13.840 --> 3:10:15.540\n even though it took us four years to get there,\n\n3:10:15.540 --> 3:10:18.420\n a lot of work, say congratulations on Shelley.\n\n3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:20.620\n But I had a lot of people when Ada reached the dollar\n\n3:10:20.620 --> 3:10:22.820\n say, we're so proud of you, amazing work,\n\n3:10:22.820 --> 3:10:24.340\n congratulations and so forth.\n\n3:10:24.340 --> 3:10:26.260\n And that's probably the most disheartening thing\n\n3:10:26.260 --> 3:10:30.380\n about the whole being around and doing this stuff\n\n3:10:30.380 --> 3:10:32.620\n where all the things you do only matter\n\n3:10:32.620 --> 3:10:34.580\n as long as it's making someone else rich.\n\n3:10:34.580 --> 3:10:37.900\n And in a way I feel almost like a failure\n\n3:10:37.900 --> 3:10:42.460\n because that mindset means that we haven't yet\n\n3:10:42.460 --> 3:10:44.860\n inculcated the community in a proper way,\n\n3:10:44.860 --> 3:10:48.260\n saying, hey guys, this is about more than money.\n\n3:10:48.260 --> 3:10:49.820\n It's about more than the value of Ada.\n\n3:10:49.820 --> 3:10:51.140\n What we're attempting to do here\n\n3:10:51.140 --> 3:10:52.940\n is reengineer the way society works.\n\n3:10:52.940 --> 3:10:54.580\n I'd like your voting to be different.\n\n3:10:54.580 --> 3:10:55.860\n I'd like your property to be different.\n\n3:10:55.860 --> 3:10:58.820\n I'd like you on your cell phone to have a universal wallet.\n\n3:10:58.820 --> 3:11:00.500\n And when you go to Starbucks or wherever,\n\n3:11:00.500 --> 3:11:03.460\n you can buy your coffee with silver or gold\n\n3:11:03.460 --> 3:11:05.400\n or airline miles or something like that.\n\n3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:07.180\n And they get paid whenever the hell they wanna get paid.\n\n3:11:07.180 --> 3:11:09.060\n And I want those rails to be done with a system\n\n3:11:09.060 --> 3:11:11.220\n that puts you in charge, not someone else.\n\n3:11:11.220 --> 3:11:12.740\n And they say, yeah, that's all fine and great.\n\n3:11:12.740 --> 3:11:15.740\n As long as Ada's $5, we're all happy.\n\n3:11:15.740 --> 3:11:18.040\n You see, so that's a problem.\n\n3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:19.700\n There are of course other things that could fail,\n\n3:11:19.700 --> 3:11:22.100\n like we could lose project cohesion,\n\n3:11:22.100 --> 3:11:23.820\n lots of people could quit and die.\n\n3:11:23.820 --> 3:11:25.420\n But again, there's so much momentum.\n\n3:11:25.420 --> 3:11:26.420\n There's so many things here.\n\n3:11:26.420 --> 3:11:27.980\n The ideas are already out there\n\n3:11:27.980 --> 3:11:29.980\n and there's no intellectual property.\n\n3:11:29.980 --> 3:11:31.220\n When you publish a hundred papers,\n\n3:11:31.220 --> 3:11:32.620\n you read a million lines of code,\n\n3:11:32.620 --> 3:11:34.460\n that's something and it's permanent.\n\n3:11:34.460 --> 3:11:35.940\n And it's in the commons now.\n\n3:11:35.940 --> 3:11:38.380\n So it's just as much yours as it is mine.\n\n3:11:38.380 --> 3:11:41.180\n So there's no notion that somehow,\n\n3:11:41.180 --> 3:11:43.300\n if the core development company disappeared,\n\n3:11:43.300 --> 3:11:46.860\n then that concept is lost forever,\n\n3:11:46.860 --> 3:11:50.220\n like the library of Alexandria burning to the ground.\n\n3:11:50.220 --> 3:11:51.380\n It's there.\n\n3:11:51.380 --> 3:11:55.420\n And someone else will take it, fork it and get it done.\n\n3:11:55.420 --> 3:11:56.940\n I mean, first of all, that's fascinating.\n\n3:11:56.940 --> 3:11:57.940\n The self evolution,\n\n3:11:57.940 --> 3:11:59.860\n you don't know which trajectories that's gonna take,\n\n3:11:59.860 --> 3:12:03.620\n but also there's could be singular events\n\n3:12:03.620 --> 3:12:07.860\n like bugs in the system create an opportunity\n\n3:12:07.860 --> 3:12:09.380\n to hack the system.\n\n3:12:09.380 --> 3:12:10.780\n Is that something that you see\n\n3:12:10.780 --> 3:12:12.860\n as a potential failure case?\n\n3:12:12.860 --> 3:12:14.540\n Yeah, it's always a possibility.\n\n3:12:14.540 --> 3:12:15.540\n Bugs can exist.\n\n3:12:15.540 --> 3:12:17.940\n There can be flaws in the protocol design.\n\n3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:19.500\n Zcash was a great example of that,\n\n3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:21.060\n where there was a subtle flaw\n\n3:12:21.060 --> 3:12:23.340\n and it damaged the fidelity of the cryptocurrency\n\n3:12:23.340 --> 3:12:26.100\n in ways no other cryptocurrencies ever experienced.\n\n3:12:26.100 --> 3:12:27.980\n Normally when you have a bug,\n\n3:12:27.980 --> 3:12:30.300\n the bug you can see it like the Bitcoin overflow,\n\n3:12:30.300 --> 3:12:31.380\n the value overflow incident.\n\n3:12:31.380 --> 3:12:32.580\n Yes, Bitcoin can be created,\n\n3:12:32.580 --> 3:12:34.460\n but we can verify they weren't.\n\n3:12:34.460 --> 3:12:36.420\n So the monetary policy is preserved.\n\n3:12:36.420 --> 3:12:39.260\n When you have a bug with a private system like Zcash\n\n3:12:39.260 --> 3:12:41.460\n and it exists on the shielded side,\n\n3:12:41.460 --> 3:12:43.580\n there's no guarantee unless you can audit\n\n3:12:43.580 --> 3:12:45.780\n the total supply inside that shielded side.\n\n3:12:45.780 --> 3:12:47.340\n My understanding is you can't,\n\n3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:49.140\n that somebody didn't exploit the bug\n\n3:12:49.140 --> 3:12:51.140\n and create trillions of these coins out of thin air\n\n3:12:51.140 --> 3:12:53.820\n and just hiding them on that system and dripping them out.\n\n3:12:53.820 --> 3:12:55.980\n And so the monetary policy is forever damaged\n\n3:12:55.980 --> 3:12:57.540\n as a consequence of bug like that.\n\n3:12:57.540 --> 3:12:59.420\n It's probably the worst type of bug you can have\n\n3:12:59.420 --> 3:13:01.060\n for these types of products.\n\n3:13:01.060 --> 3:13:03.980\n So no matter how good of a job you do,\n\n3:13:03.980 --> 3:13:05.180\n they have great scientists,\n\n3:13:05.180 --> 3:13:07.420\n there are great people there, great engineers there.\n\n3:13:07.420 --> 3:13:08.940\n You can always have something like that,\n\n3:13:08.940 --> 3:13:11.060\n seep its way in, leak its way in,\n\n3:13:11.060 --> 3:13:12.780\n and that lurks in the distance.\n\n3:13:12.780 --> 3:13:15.500\n But if that's a problem shared\n\n3:13:15.500 --> 3:13:17.180\n with every one of your neighbors,\n\n3:13:18.220 --> 3:13:20.460\n it's like everybody working on a nuclear power plant.\n\n3:13:20.460 --> 3:13:22.460\n Well, yeah, you can all die of radiation poisoning.\n\n3:13:22.460 --> 3:13:24.980\n Well, we all kind of knew that, didn't we?\n\n3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:28.740\n So it's like, I don't really think too much about it.\n\n3:13:28.740 --> 3:13:30.580\n I think the context of the question was more,\n\n3:13:30.580 --> 3:13:33.420\n what is Cardano specific over Ethereum or Bitcoin\n\n3:13:33.420 --> 3:13:34.500\n or any of these other things?\n\n3:13:34.500 --> 3:13:37.540\n And yeah, okay, existential lurking bug could happen.\n\n3:13:37.540 --> 3:13:40.140\n It's lower probability for us than the other systems\n\n3:13:40.140 --> 3:13:41.940\n because we use formal methods\n\n3:13:41.940 --> 3:13:45.860\n and we use peer review inside the protocol design.\n\n3:13:45.860 --> 3:13:48.140\n So there's been more eyeballs and tools and techniques\n\n3:13:48.140 --> 3:13:49.180\n used to check things.\n\n3:13:49.180 --> 3:13:50.860\n And we actually have discovered\n\n3:13:50.860 --> 3:13:53.340\n a lot of weird wonky bugs before production\n\n3:13:53.340 --> 3:13:54.900\n and resolve those bugs.\n\n3:13:54.900 --> 3:13:56.620\n So it shows you the system works.\n\n3:13:56.620 --> 3:13:57.740\n It's a lot of fun.\n\n3:13:57.740 --> 3:14:00.540\n What about close kind of competitors?\n\n3:14:00.540 --> 3:14:01.820\n I don't know if you would put it that way,\n\n3:14:01.820 --> 3:14:03.980\n but if you look in the space of ideas,\n\n3:14:05.100 --> 3:14:08.380\n competitor cryptocurrencies like Polkadot,\n\n3:14:08.380 --> 3:14:09.780\n what are some interesting difference\n\n3:14:09.780 --> 3:14:12.100\n between Cardano and Polkadot?\n\n3:14:12.100 --> 3:14:14.340\n Technically, philosophically, historically,\n\n3:14:14.340 --> 3:14:15.580\n is that something you think about\n\n3:14:15.580 --> 3:14:17.540\n when you think about the future of Cardano?\n\n3:14:17.540 --> 3:14:19.180\n Yeah, I mean, we do.\n\n3:14:19.180 --> 3:14:20.700\n We actually have a whole group of people\n\n3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:23.300\n that do business intelligence and comparative analysis.\n\n3:14:23.300 --> 3:14:24.660\n And we're getting to a point\n\n3:14:24.660 --> 3:14:27.180\n where we wanna start eventually forking their code\n\n3:14:27.180 --> 3:14:28.540\n and running private versions of it\n\n3:14:28.540 --> 3:14:29.660\n and just playing around with things.\n\n3:14:29.660 --> 3:14:30.500\n Well, that's fascinating.\n\n3:14:30.500 --> 3:14:31.940\n Getting better at it.\n\n3:14:31.940 --> 3:14:33.260\n Consensus actually does this.\n\n3:14:33.260 --> 3:14:34.100\n They actually did it with EOS.\n\n3:14:34.100 --> 3:14:36.500\n And they wrote this lovely report like trashing EOS,\n\n3:14:36.500 --> 3:14:37.340\n saying, hey, by the way,\n\n3:14:37.340 --> 3:14:39.860\n all those claims these guys made are just not true.\n\n3:14:40.820 --> 3:14:42.900\n But it's nice to do that.\n\n3:14:42.900 --> 3:14:44.980\n It's nice to use your competitor's technology\n\n3:14:44.980 --> 3:14:46.980\n or competing protocol technology\n\n3:14:46.980 --> 3:14:48.540\n because you learn a lot along the process.\n\n3:14:48.540 --> 3:14:50.220\n It's not all bad.\n\n3:14:50.220 --> 3:14:51.700\n There's always something there\n\n3:14:51.700 --> 3:14:53.780\n because they have different trade offs and customers\n\n3:14:53.780 --> 3:14:55.380\n that potentially are more interesting.\n\n3:14:55.380 --> 3:14:56.740\n Like right now we're grokking,\n\n3:14:56.740 --> 3:14:59.420\n how do we wanna do the side chain model of Cardano?\n\n3:14:59.420 --> 3:15:01.980\n Polkadot's actually a tremendously useful piece\n\n3:15:01.980 --> 3:15:03.780\n of infrastructure for that conversation\n\n3:15:03.780 --> 3:15:07.060\n because they copied part of our infrastructure.\n\n3:15:07.060 --> 3:15:08.700\n Gavin's a trained computer scientist.\n\n3:15:08.700 --> 3:15:12.860\n He got his PhD from York and he read our papers obviously.\n\n3:15:12.860 --> 3:15:15.420\n And he realized that Ouroboros was a really good\n\n3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:18.420\n starting place for building a proof of stake system.\n\n3:15:18.420 --> 3:15:21.220\n So Polkadot's consensus is very similar to ours.\n\n3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:22.060\n And so if you're saying,\n\n3:15:22.060 --> 3:15:24.340\n hey, how do you do a good side chain model\n\n3:15:24.340 --> 3:15:26.900\n with an Ouroboros style proof of stake?\n\n3:15:26.900 --> 3:15:29.020\n Well, we already have this parachain thing, right?\n\n3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:31.260\n And so now by just looking at that,\n\n3:15:31.260 --> 3:15:34.500\n I can kind of get an idea of how, one way of doing it.\n\n3:15:34.500 --> 3:15:36.940\n And so that's just beautiful that we live in a space\n\n3:15:36.940 --> 3:15:38.380\n where that's there, it's open source,\n\n3:15:38.380 --> 3:15:39.220\n and it's really good.\n\n3:15:39.220 --> 3:15:41.140\n You just say, okay, well, we'll just take that\n\n3:15:41.140 --> 3:15:41.980\n and adopt that.\n\n3:15:41.980 --> 3:15:42.820\n There's no shame.\n\n3:15:43.740 --> 3:15:46.820\n The other side of it is that Polkadot\n\n3:15:46.820 --> 3:15:49.820\n really has focused a lot on commercial adoption,\n\n3:15:49.820 --> 3:15:53.420\n Silicon Valley adoption, getting real use and utility.\n\n3:15:53.420 --> 3:15:55.620\n I say in a much more sustainable way\n\n3:15:55.620 --> 3:15:57.380\n than Ethereum is focused on.\n\n3:15:57.380 --> 3:15:59.580\n Ethereum was kind of a spray and pray thing.\n\n3:15:59.580 --> 3:16:00.660\n Polkadot was more of like,\n\n3:16:00.660 --> 3:16:02.300\n hey, let's go ahead and actually\n\n3:16:02.300 --> 3:16:04.540\n curate our ecosystem more carefully.\n\n3:16:04.540 --> 3:16:06.420\n And we're gonna build it in a way\n\n3:16:06.420 --> 3:16:09.380\n where there's predictable or as predictable a cost\n\n3:16:09.380 --> 3:16:12.900\n as possible with the rollout of the infrastructure.\n\n3:16:12.900 --> 3:16:16.540\n And that's so important for a business.\n\n3:16:16.540 --> 3:16:18.620\n It's not necessarily important for an experiment\n\n3:16:18.620 --> 3:16:20.740\n or a startup where they're just trying\n\n3:16:20.740 --> 3:16:22.860\n to get populations quickly as possible.\n\n3:16:22.860 --> 3:16:24.380\n We'll figure out later.\n\n3:16:24.380 --> 3:16:25.660\n But if you're actually sitting there saying,\n\n3:16:25.660 --> 3:16:28.340\n I need to know what my expenses are three years,\n\n3:16:28.340 --> 3:16:30.180\n five years, 10 years into the future,\n\n3:16:30.180 --> 3:16:31.900\n you need predictability there.\n\n3:16:31.900 --> 3:16:33.820\n I think they have a better shot of it than anything\n\n3:16:33.820 --> 3:16:37.580\n in F2 or with currently Ethereum.\n\n3:16:37.580 --> 3:16:40.380\n Now, the big contrast between the two systems,\n\n3:16:40.380 --> 3:16:43.300\n those we actually have native multi asset,\n\n3:16:43.300 --> 3:16:44.620\n we have a different accounting model.\n\n3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:47.260\n I think our base ledger is far more expressive.\n\n3:16:47.260 --> 3:16:48.900\n Our rate of evolution was proof of stake\n\n3:16:48.900 --> 3:16:50.140\n is much faster than theirs\n\n3:16:50.140 --> 3:16:51.540\n because they're based on derivative work\n\n3:16:51.540 --> 3:16:54.500\n and we already have Ouroboros Omega and other things there.\n\n3:16:54.500 --> 3:16:55.660\n I think we have a better,\n\n3:16:55.660 --> 3:16:58.460\n ultimately a better side chain model will come\n\n3:16:58.460 --> 3:17:00.620\n because we have something called Mythril for that.\n\n3:17:00.620 --> 3:17:02.860\n But we learned a lot from their work.\n\n3:17:02.860 --> 3:17:04.740\n The other thing is that we thought about governance\n\n3:17:04.740 --> 3:17:06.540\n a lot more carefully in my view.\n\n3:17:06.540 --> 3:17:08.260\n And we have Catalyst and Voltaire\n\n3:17:08.260 --> 3:17:10.300\n and really the key there is saying,\n\n3:17:10.300 --> 3:17:12.060\n how do we make sure that every single person\n\n3:17:12.060 --> 3:17:14.740\n who holds data can participate in the network?\n\n3:17:14.740 --> 3:17:17.380\n That wasn't a high design priority of Polkadot.\n\n3:17:17.380 --> 3:17:19.700\n It was more a fast commercial adoption.\n\n3:17:19.700 --> 3:17:22.700\n The acquisition of customers will come to governance later.\n\n3:17:22.700 --> 3:17:25.820\n And those were just different business philosophies.\n\n3:17:25.820 --> 3:17:28.300\n But it's nice to have a competitor like that.\n\n3:17:28.300 --> 3:17:31.500\n And oftentimes I've said that Polkadot's like Ethereum 1.5.\n\n3:17:31.500 --> 3:17:33.620\n It's what F2 probably should have been.\n\n3:17:33.620 --> 3:17:35.100\n There was what Vitalik wanted to do,\n\n3:17:35.100 --> 3:17:38.660\n which was incredibly aggressive and brilliant,\n\n3:17:38.660 --> 3:17:39.820\n but it's a lot.\n\n3:17:39.820 --> 3:17:42.580\n And there's so much execution risk in that plan.\n\n3:17:42.580 --> 3:17:44.180\n And I think they've had like six years\n\n3:17:44.180 --> 3:17:45.620\n of playing around with it.\n\n3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:47.860\n Had they gone down the Polkadot road,\n\n3:17:47.860 --> 3:17:49.540\n they probably would have been a market with it\n\n3:17:49.540 --> 3:17:50.460\n in 2018.\n\n3:17:50.460 --> 3:17:52.940\n And because they already had the network effect,\n\n3:17:52.940 --> 3:17:55.100\n they would have had years of building on that,\n\n3:17:55.100 --> 3:17:55.940\n iterating that.\n\n3:17:55.940 --> 3:17:57.380\n And they already had a path to it too.\n\n3:17:57.380 --> 3:17:59.260\n All they had to do was just give Elaine Chi\n\n3:17:59.260 --> 3:18:01.500\n and her cohorts at Cornell,\n\n3:18:01.500 --> 3:18:02.900\n five, $10 million grants.\n\n3:18:02.900 --> 3:18:05.380\n Snow White would have been the dominant protocol,\n\n3:18:05.380 --> 3:18:08.260\n not Ouroboros in the proof of stake space.\n\n3:18:08.260 --> 3:18:09.620\n So it's really fascinating historically\n\n3:18:09.620 --> 3:18:11.220\n when you look at these things and the rivalries\n\n3:18:11.220 --> 3:18:12.700\n and what they did and what they didn't do.\n\n3:18:12.700 --> 3:18:17.700\n And Gavin had a chance to have C++ Ethereum\n\n3:18:17.700 --> 3:18:21.860\n be used as IBM's enterprise blockchain.\n\n3:18:21.860 --> 3:18:24.740\n The only reason they didn't do it is it was licensed GPL.\n\n3:18:24.740 --> 3:18:27.180\n And I think they wanted to relicense Apache.\n\n3:18:27.180 --> 3:18:28.580\n If you ever talked to Bob Summerwall,\n\n3:18:28.580 --> 3:18:31.020\n he was there at the time and he had this amazing story\n\n3:18:31.020 --> 3:18:34.540\n about like these terrible fights where it's like,\n\n3:18:34.540 --> 3:18:36.380\n guys, just relicense the goddamn code.\n\n3:18:36.380 --> 3:18:37.940\n Let's figure out a way to make this happen\n\n3:18:37.940 --> 3:18:40.700\n so that we can get this huge network effect\n\n3:18:40.700 --> 3:18:43.180\n of being basically IBM's play.\n\n3:18:43.180 --> 3:18:44.900\n They didn't do it, they created Fabric,\n\n3:18:44.900 --> 3:18:46.420\n these types of things.\n\n3:18:46.420 --> 3:18:49.900\n So there's a lot of lore and stories in that respect.\n\n3:18:49.900 --> 3:18:52.620\n But the space is better because of Polkadot.\n\n3:18:52.620 --> 3:18:53.980\n And there's a lot of good people there.\n\n3:18:53.980 --> 3:18:55.780\n Web3 is a good concept.\n\n3:18:55.780 --> 3:18:58.700\n And we run into their people in Germany and Zurich a lot.\n\n3:18:58.700 --> 3:19:00.740\n And they've always been cordial and friendly\n\n3:19:00.740 --> 3:19:02.900\n and really affable.\n\n3:19:02.900 --> 3:19:04.380\n Before I talk to you about governance,\n\n3:19:04.380 --> 3:19:07.820\n which is one of the most fascinating things about Cardano,\n\n3:19:07.820 --> 3:19:10.300\n there's a lot of stuff to untangle there.\n\n3:19:10.300 --> 3:19:15.020\n Since you mentioned some humans\n\n3:19:15.020 --> 3:19:17.460\n in this wonderful story,\n\n3:19:17.460 --> 3:19:22.180\n you did make a video before we talked directed to me.\n\n3:19:22.180 --> 3:19:23.580\n Thank you so much for that.\n\n3:19:24.660 --> 3:19:26.500\n It came from a place of love.\n\n3:19:29.460 --> 3:19:32.580\n But it was basically saying, as we have been,\n\n3:19:32.580 --> 3:19:34.420\n you would love to talk about the technology,\n\n3:19:34.420 --> 3:19:37.420\n about the future that you're creating with Cardano\n\n3:19:37.420 --> 3:19:40.220\n and just the future of the cryptocurrency space.\n\n3:19:40.220 --> 3:19:42.900\n I think you're kind of worried\n\n3:19:42.900 --> 3:19:44.660\n that you'll be talking to a journalist\n\n3:19:44.660 --> 3:19:47.700\n that's looking for clickbait content, that kind of thing.\n\n3:19:47.700 --> 3:19:49.420\n But I'm fascinated by human beings.\n\n3:19:49.420 --> 3:19:51.580\n I think you're all, from an outsider perspective,\n\n3:19:51.580 --> 3:19:52.780\n incredible human beings.\n\n3:19:52.780 --> 3:19:54.340\n I don't know about personal intentions,\n\n3:19:54.340 --> 3:19:55.260\n all those kinds of stuff,\n\n3:19:55.260 --> 3:19:57.820\n but I think you're changing the world together\n\n3:19:57.820 --> 3:19:59.060\n in different ways.\n\n3:19:59.060 --> 3:20:02.500\n And I just wanted to sort of give you an opportunity.\n\n3:20:02.500 --> 3:20:06.420\n If there's, in the name of love and friendship,\n\n3:20:06.420 --> 3:20:09.700\n is there something from your history\n\n3:20:09.700 --> 3:20:11.380\n over the past decade or so,\n\n3:20:11.380 --> 3:20:13.980\n outside of technology and the human side of things\n\n3:20:13.980 --> 3:20:16.940\n that you draw inspiration from, you draw insight from,\n\n3:20:16.940 --> 3:20:18.820\n you're just proud that happened?\n\n3:20:18.820 --> 3:20:21.940\n I mean, it's like asking Paul McCartney about John Lennon.\n\n3:20:21.940 --> 3:20:23.180\n Tell us about John Lennon.\n\n3:20:23.180 --> 3:20:24.300\n It's like, you know.\n\n3:20:24.300 --> 3:20:25.700\n How much do you hate Yoko?\n\n3:20:25.700 --> 3:20:28.620\n For almost eight years now,\n\n3:20:28.620 --> 3:20:31.300\n I've been, it's just been this reoccurring pattern\n\n3:20:31.300 --> 3:20:32.140\n every interview.\n\n3:20:32.140 --> 3:20:33.820\n Tell us about your time at Ethereum.\n\n3:20:33.820 --> 3:20:35.300\n Those six months you spent there\n\n3:20:35.300 --> 3:20:37.380\n that were so pleasant and enjoyable.\n\n3:20:37.380 --> 3:20:38.380\n Tell us all about it.\n\n3:20:38.380 --> 3:20:40.780\n And tell us about your relationship with Vitalik.\n\n3:20:40.780 --> 3:20:42.260\n It's like, I barely talk to the guy.\n\n3:20:42.260 --> 3:20:43.420\n I see him every now and then.\n\n3:20:43.420 --> 3:20:44.900\n Like, every two years we say, hey.\n\n3:20:44.900 --> 3:20:45.740\n He says, hey.\n\n3:20:45.740 --> 3:20:46.620\n It's like, okay.\n\n3:20:46.620 --> 3:20:49.180\n Maybe 10, 20 years in the future,\n\n3:20:49.180 --> 3:20:52.540\n Walt Mossberg or Robo Walt will bring us together\n\n3:20:52.540 --> 3:20:55.820\n like he did Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.\n\n3:20:55.820 --> 3:20:57.540\n And we can kind of talk about, you know.\n\n3:20:57.540 --> 3:20:59.460\n That was a tense conversation, by the way.\n\n3:20:59.460 --> 3:21:00.820\n The 2007 interview?\n\n3:21:00.820 --> 3:21:01.660\n Yeah, the 2007.\n\n3:21:01.660 --> 3:21:03.100\n Oh, it was great though, wasn't it?\n\n3:21:03.100 --> 3:21:05.580\n Yeah, that was the body language.\n\n3:21:05.580 --> 3:21:06.460\n That was art.\n\n3:21:06.460 --> 3:21:07.300\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:07.300 --> 3:21:08.860\n That was fascinating.\n\n3:21:08.860 --> 3:21:11.420\n That was a fascinating study of human nature.\n\n3:21:11.420 --> 3:21:12.980\n Yeah, so maybe that'll be us.\n\n3:21:12.980 --> 3:21:14.060\n In like 10 or 20 years.\n\n3:21:14.060 --> 3:21:14.900\n Who the hell knows?\n\n3:21:14.900 --> 3:21:16.340\n The robot versions of all three of you.\n\n3:21:16.340 --> 3:21:18.460\n Yeah, my only point though is that, you know,\n\n3:21:18.460 --> 3:21:20.620\n it's a closed chapter and it's funny.\n\n3:21:20.620 --> 3:21:21.740\n I was there for six months.\n\n3:21:21.740 --> 3:21:23.780\n I've been building Cardano for years.\n\n3:21:23.780 --> 3:21:25.300\n We've done all this stuff.\n\n3:21:25.300 --> 3:21:27.140\n I've been to 52 countries.\n\n3:21:27.140 --> 3:21:29.540\n I love talking about those experiences.\n\n3:21:29.540 --> 3:21:30.580\n And there's so many of them.\n\n3:21:30.580 --> 3:21:32.040\n I've met heads of state.\n\n3:21:32.040 --> 3:21:34.940\n You know, I went to Mongolia, like eagle hunting\n\n3:21:34.940 --> 3:21:37.220\n and, you know, being bucked off horses\n\n3:21:37.220 --> 3:21:39.160\n and riding the sand dunes.\n\n3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:43.880\n We've invented all this new cool technology\n\n3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:45.800\n that the space itself is using.\n\n3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:48.660\n And we've had a chance to sit on government panels,\n\n3:21:48.660 --> 3:21:51.400\n pass laws, 24 laws in Wyoming.\n\n3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:54.120\n I mean, there's like all this amazing stuff that's there.\n\n3:21:54.120 --> 3:21:55.640\n And it's such a fun conversation.\n\n3:21:55.640 --> 3:21:57.500\n There's so many superheroes in that conversation,\n\n3:21:57.500 --> 3:21:59.340\n like Cailin Long and Taylor Limholm.\n\n3:21:59.340 --> 3:22:03.040\n And there's Alex Sherpanoi, who we already mentioned\n\n3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:04.440\n that I met along the travels.\n\n3:22:04.440 --> 3:22:05.640\n I met Ralph Merkle.\n\n3:22:05.640 --> 3:22:07.800\n Cool, I met all these amazing people along the way.\n\n3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:10.000\n I have fond memories of,\n\n3:22:10.000 --> 3:22:11.440\n by the way, you should interview him, by the way.\n\n3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:13.800\n Amazing guy, does nanotech now.\n\n3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:15.520\n You know, I met, you know, I was hanging out\n\n3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:16.480\n with Sylvia McCauley.\n\n3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:18.400\n And I remember before we launched Yalgrant,\n\n3:22:18.400 --> 3:22:21.240\n I said, you should really just do a Bitcoin cash style play\n\n3:22:21.240 --> 3:22:22.320\n and airdrop Bitcoin.\n\n3:22:22.320 --> 3:22:24.320\n What the hell are you doing distributing this?\n\n3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:26.440\n He's like, trust me, I know what I'm doing.\n\n3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:29.160\n You know, so it's like so many great conversations\n\n3:22:29.160 --> 3:22:30.120\n and so many great people.\n\n3:22:30.120 --> 3:22:32.040\n And what I've really noticed in this industry,\n\n3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:34.760\n when you separate the tribalism, the maximum side,\n\n3:22:34.760 --> 3:22:38.880\n there really is a love of creativity and building.\n\n3:22:38.880 --> 3:22:41.120\n And there's like no other industry like it.\n\n3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:42.960\n I've been in many different places in life.\n\n3:22:42.960 --> 3:22:44.920\n And here, people just love art.\n\n3:22:44.920 --> 3:22:45.760\n They love beauty.\n\n3:22:45.760 --> 3:22:47.560\n They love the unknown.\n\n3:22:47.560 --> 3:22:48.600\n They love pushing things.\n\n3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:52.120\n They love, you know, really, you know, in some cases,\n\n3:22:53.160 --> 3:22:55.420\n not necessarily the most socially beneficial way,\n\n3:22:55.420 --> 3:22:57.560\n but they really love the challenge, right?\n\n3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:00.720\n And that has been fun.\n\n3:23:00.720 --> 3:23:02.600\n I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.\n\n3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:07.480\n The dark side of the industry is that people love labels.\n\n3:23:07.480 --> 3:23:09.200\n They love saying this person's good.\n\n3:23:09.200 --> 3:23:10.420\n This person's evil.\n\n3:23:10.420 --> 3:23:11.960\n This person's a sociopath.\n\n3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:12.960\n This person's not.\n\n3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:15.080\n And by the way, they've never met that person.\n\n3:23:15.080 --> 3:23:16.840\n They've never interacted with that person.\n\n3:23:16.840 --> 3:23:19.620\n And they just say, well, I heard from this person,\n\n3:23:19.620 --> 3:23:22.000\n I read this book, or I did that.\n\n3:23:22.000 --> 3:23:24.000\n I was like, oh, so some books written by a journalist\n\n3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:27.560\n makes $50,000 a year who's looking for a movie deal,\n\n3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:29.840\n say that somebody said this or did this\n\n3:23:29.840 --> 3:23:32.040\n in an unconfirmed way.\n\n3:23:32.040 --> 3:23:33.720\n What can you do, sue them for slander?\n\n3:23:33.720 --> 3:23:36.400\n I mean, so you just let it ride and you let it roll.\n\n3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:38.480\n And if it was just ending there, that'd be great.\n\n3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:41.680\n But the problem is it cascades and people just repost it\n\n3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:44.160\n and they relive it again and again and again.\n\n3:23:44.160 --> 3:23:45.200\n And then what do you do about it?\n\n3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:46.040\n You eventually just say,\n\n3:23:46.040 --> 3:23:47.440\n I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.\n\n3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:48.400\n I'm done with it.\n\n3:23:48.400 --> 3:23:50.120\n And you move on and you say, you know what?\n\n3:23:50.120 --> 3:23:51.400\n If it's your problem, it's your problem.\n\n3:23:51.400 --> 3:23:53.240\n It's your reality that you wanna live in.\n\n3:23:53.240 --> 3:23:55.800\n I'll be defined by the things that I achieve and do\n\n3:23:55.800 --> 3:23:58.640\n and the people that we help and the things that we build.\n\n3:23:58.640 --> 3:24:00.960\n And, you know, since I started in this industry,\n\n3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:03.560\n I've gotten to a point where not only do we have\n\n3:24:03.560 --> 3:24:06.360\n this amazing company with these incredible people\n\n3:24:06.360 --> 3:24:07.920\n who work at this company,\n\n3:24:07.920 --> 3:24:09.600\n but we also have the ability to pursue\n\n3:24:09.600 --> 3:24:10.920\n amazing different interests.\n\n3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:13.000\n Like I met Ben Gortzell.\n\n3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:15.600\n And Ben and I are gonna do an AGI project together.\n\n3:24:15.600 --> 3:24:17.440\n And of all places, Rwanda.\n\n3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:20.200\n And he gave me this 85 fucking page paper.\n\n3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:23.080\n He was wearing that damn hat that he always wears.\n\n3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:25.560\n I think he showers with the hat on.\n\n3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:27.200\n He never takes that thing off.\n\n3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:29.320\n I think he refused, I interviewed him\n\n3:24:29.320 --> 3:24:32.040\n and he refused to tell me the story of the hat.\n\n3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:33.040\n He wouldn't tell me either.\n\n3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:34.960\n I interviewed him as well in Wyoming.\n\n3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:37.760\n And every time I call him, he'll have his shirt off.\n\n3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:39.120\n He'll have the fucking hat on.\n\n3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:41.160\n And now all I can think about is the hat.\n\n3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:42.640\n I wonder what the story there is.\n\n3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:44.880\n I know, it's like, it's gotta be.\n\n3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:46.000\n That might be the AGI.\n\n3:24:46.000 --> 3:24:46.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:48.800\n But anyway, he gives me this 80 page paper\n\n3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:50.920\n and he says, Charles, it's like the combination\n\n3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:51.760\n of everything.\n\n3:24:51.760 --> 3:24:53.200\n This is how we're gonna do AGI.\n\n3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:54.400\n And I said, that's crazy, Ben.\n\n3:24:54.400 --> 3:24:56.400\n I said, I'll throw some money at it.\n\n3:24:56.400 --> 3:24:58.120\n So we're gonna hire some developers.\n\n3:24:58.120 --> 3:24:59.480\n I have no idea where it's gonna go,\n\n3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:02.360\n but I mean, I get to hang out with Ben Corson.\n\n3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:03.440\n That's fun.\n\n3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:04.280\n That's the kind of stuff.\n\n3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:06.360\n And that's the really cool side of the space.\n\n3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:09.080\n And it's what I enjoy.\n\n3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:12.360\n And the Vitalik rivalry thing, the Ethereum thing,\n\n3:25:12.360 --> 3:25:14.480\n I try my best not to mention it.\n\n3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:16.640\n I hate the fact that still when Bloomberg\n\n3:25:16.640 --> 3:25:18.200\n or anybody else writes a story about me,\n\n3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:20.200\n they'll say Ethereum co founder.\n\n3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:22.360\n Like, can you say something else?\n\n3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:24.520\n Well, I think if I've learned anything from the internet,\n\n3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:25.840\n you can't resist that kind of stuff.\n\n3:25:25.840 --> 3:25:27.680\n You just have to, this is Elon.\n\n3:25:27.680 --> 3:25:30.040\n It's the joke, joke it away.\n\n3:25:30.040 --> 3:25:31.760\n I've noticed this, this is already starting\n\n3:25:31.760 --> 3:25:32.600\n to happen with me.\n\n3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:34.200\n It's like, people just make up stuff.\n\n3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:36.400\n They haven't made up anything interesting yet,\n\n3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:37.960\n but they could.\n\n3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:39.880\n And I've seen that with Bill Gates, for example,\n\n3:25:39.880 --> 3:25:41.400\n just stuff being made up.\n\n3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:43.120\n I mean, probably half of it is true.\n\n3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:43.960\n Sorry, internet.\n\n3:25:43.960 --> 3:25:44.800\n I'm sorry.\n\n3:25:44.800 --> 3:25:48.280\n But like, I guess what I realized,\n\n3:25:48.280 --> 3:25:49.720\n this is the dark side of memes,\n\n3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:52.920\n is you can just make something up and it'll spread.\n\n3:25:52.920 --> 3:25:53.760\n And then that's it.\n\n3:25:53.760 --> 3:25:55.680\n And that's what happens.\n\n3:25:55.680 --> 3:25:58.360\n But then, and the problem is half the world will believe it.\n\n3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:01.000\n Yeah, it could be good stuff, it could be bad stuff.\n\n3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:04.280\n So I guess the hope is it bounces off in the end.\n\n3:26:04.280 --> 3:26:06.800\n I tend to believe you almost want to play with that\n\n3:26:06.800 --> 3:26:08.040\n and not take it seriously.\n\n3:26:08.040 --> 3:26:10.040\n Just kind of laugh it off and enjoy life\n\n3:26:10.040 --> 3:26:13.240\n and keep creating, keep doing awesome stuff.\n\n3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:16.160\n Operating both in the physical space with other humans\n\n3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:18.640\n and in the digital space with humans and AI systems\n\n3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:19.800\n and just have fun.\n\n3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:22.960\n Because most of us in the long arc of history\n\n3:26:22.960 --> 3:26:26.080\n will be completely forgotten and will matter.\n\n3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:27.480\n It'll all be some kind of,\n\n3:26:27.480 --> 3:26:30.600\n just like H Hacker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:32.280\n will just be one sentence that summarizes\n\n3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:34.360\n all of our existence.\n\n3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:37.360\n And the sad thing is most of us will not be part\n\n3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:38.920\n of that sentence or all of us.\n\n3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:41.000\n Well, thanks for all the fish, Lex.\n\n3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:42.000\n Thanks for all the fish.\n\n3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:43.600\n The dolphins are running this thing\n\n3:26:43.600 --> 3:26:46.280\n and they're talking to the UFOs recently,\n\n3:26:46.280 --> 3:26:48.080\n which is very interesting.\n\n3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:50.600\n Because the UFOs keep going to the water.\n\n3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:53.760\n So we humans assume that the UFOs are here to visit,\n\n3:26:53.760 --> 3:26:55.200\n the aliens are here to visit us,\n\n3:26:55.200 --> 3:26:56.400\n but it's probably the fish.\n\n3:26:56.400 --> 3:26:58.600\n No, I just think it's next generation aircraft\n\n3:26:58.600 --> 3:27:00.120\n that we're using.\n\n3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:01.520\n Oh, that we're just not aware of.\n\n3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:03.120\n But why are they talking to the fish?\n\n3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:05.760\n Well, that's the place you test hypersonic aircraft\n\n3:27:05.760 --> 3:27:06.680\n is over oceans.\n\n3:27:06.680 --> 3:27:10.400\n So that's the Russians with their hypersonic nuclear weapons.\n\n3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:11.240\n That's what a lot.\n\n3:27:11.240 --> 3:27:13.760\n Rods from God, man, rods from God.\n\n3:27:13.760 --> 3:27:17.800\n So let me try to transition from UFOs to Abraham Lincoln.\n\n3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:22.800\n Lincoln said that nearly all men can stand adversity,\n\n3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:25.920\n but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.\n\n3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:31.200\n Do you think power and money can corrupt most people?\n\n3:27:31.200 --> 3:27:33.960\n And if so, do you worry of this corrupting force\n\n3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:35.480\n on your own mind?\n\n3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:40.360\n You're one of the leading minds in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:43.200\n You're the leader of the Cardano project.\n\n3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:47.160\n You're the king of the rats.\n\n3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:49.120\n Does this corrupt your mind,\n\n3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:51.360\n both the power and the money of it?\n\n3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:53.400\n Yeah, I mean, you see this most pervasively\n\n3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:55.920\n with people who inherit a large amount of money\n\n3:27:55.920 --> 3:28:00.400\n or title like dynasties, like the Melons or the Rockefellers\n\n3:28:00.400 --> 3:28:01.240\n or other people.\n\n3:28:01.240 --> 3:28:02.720\n It's the worst thing you can do to somebody\n\n3:28:02.720 --> 3:28:04.600\n is just hand them an enormous amount of power\n\n3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:06.600\n that they're not prepared for.\n\n3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:08.760\n And the challenge with this space is like,\n\n3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:11.480\n everybody's young and we're all billionaires now\n\n3:28:11.480 --> 3:28:12.920\n and we have these cult followings\n\n3:28:12.920 --> 3:28:14.320\n and do all these things, right?\n\n3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:15.840\n Nobody really says no to you.\n\n3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:18.960\n Like, for example, I have this ranch up in Wyoming\n\n3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:21.640\n and it has 400 bison on it.\n\n3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:23.320\n So now I'm a bison rancher.\n\n3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:28.320\n Like, if somebody was like monitoring, auditing,\n\n3:28:28.560 --> 3:28:30.080\n that'd be like, Charles, do you have any experience\n\n3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:31.640\n raising, taking care of bison?\n\n3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:33.000\n I'd be like, no.\n\n3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:34.440\n So you think it's really a good idea\n\n3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:36.800\n to have this ranch with 400 bison running around.\n\n3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:38.080\n What the hell are you gonna do with bison?\n\n3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:39.600\n I just have to figure out\n\n3:28:39.600 --> 3:28:40.920\n what I'm gonna do with these bison.\n\n3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:43.080\n So, and I, you know, we'll make a video game.\n\n3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:44.600\n We'll do crypto, we'll do crypto.\n\n3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:47.360\n We'll make a video game, we'll do crypto bison.\n\n3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:49.480\n But you're gonna get one.\n\n3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:52.160\n I'm not pulling, thank you, I'd love to.\n\n3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:53.720\n I'm not pulling at that string just yet.\n\n3:28:53.720 --> 3:28:56.520\n So I'm wondering how you're gonna connect\n\n3:28:56.520 --> 3:28:57.640\n this back to power.\n\n3:28:57.640 --> 3:28:58.480\n Right.\n\n3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:01.480\n And so, but my point is that when you are unrestrained,\n\n3:29:01.480 --> 3:29:03.640\n like literally no one can say no,\n\n3:29:03.640 --> 3:29:06.880\n or you have the ability to distort reality around yourself\n\n3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:10.320\n and you're not constrained by social customs,\n\n3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:15.320\n it creates a situation where you start losing perspective.\n\n3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:17.920\n You're not grounded anymore, I think.\n\n3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:20.760\n So it's less of a question of, will you become evil or not?\n\n3:29:20.760 --> 3:29:21.600\n It's more of a question of,\n\n3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:24.080\n will you lose so much touch with humanity\n\n3:29:24.080 --> 3:29:26.480\n that you just can't relate or understand people?\n\n3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:28.440\n And then you inadvertently, by your actions,\n\n3:29:28.440 --> 3:29:31.240\n start harming people, either through the policies\n\n3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:33.120\n that you pursue or, you know,\n\n3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:35.880\n the things that you start building and so forth.\n\n3:29:35.880 --> 3:29:38.800\n So I think the best inoculation against that\n\n3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:40.840\n is to surround yourself with activities\n\n3:29:40.840 --> 3:29:44.040\n that are utterly divorced from your reputation and status.\n\n3:29:44.040 --> 3:29:46.800\n The best thing are animals and gardening.\n\n3:29:46.800 --> 3:29:48.200\n Because, you know, a donkey doesn't care\n\n3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:49.360\n if you're a billionaire or a baroque,\n\n3:29:49.360 --> 3:29:51.360\n they'll shit on you exactly the same way.\n\n3:29:51.360 --> 3:29:52.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:29:52.600 --> 3:29:55.800\n And so there's a humility behind these types of activities\n\n3:29:55.800 --> 3:30:00.480\n and these things, and there's a honest work component.\n\n3:30:00.480 --> 3:30:03.360\n Like when you grow hay or whatever, you have to plant,\n\n3:30:03.360 --> 3:30:05.120\n you have to actually water, you have to irrigate,\n\n3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:06.160\n you have to actually be there.\n\n3:30:06.160 --> 3:30:07.640\n And if you can't use some excuse,\n\n3:30:07.640 --> 3:30:09.680\n well, I was meeting the president of El Salvador,\n\n3:30:09.680 --> 3:30:12.560\n I was doing this, and the hay doesn't give a shit.\n\n3:30:12.560 --> 3:30:13.680\n It's hay, right?\n\n3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:14.800\n So it grounds and connects you.\n\n3:30:14.800 --> 3:30:17.200\n The other thing is you have to get used to giving away.\n\n3:30:17.200 --> 3:30:19.440\n All the best things in my life have come\n\n3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:21.360\n as a consequence of first giving.\n\n3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:23.040\n Like I got started in the cryptocurrency space\n\n3:30:23.040 --> 3:30:24.320\n by giving away a free class.\n\n3:30:24.320 --> 3:30:26.520\n Bitcoin or how we learn to stop worrying or love crypto.\n\n3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:28.160\n You did a free podcast, right?\n\n3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:31.360\n In life, if you give and you develop that mindset\n\n3:30:31.360 --> 3:30:33.920\n of I'm not attached to the things I have,\n\n3:30:33.920 --> 3:30:36.280\n and if push comes to shove, it goes away,\n\n3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:37.760\n usually you get more back.\n\n3:30:37.760 --> 3:30:39.880\n Like I gave away all my ether, I never received any of it.\n\n3:30:39.880 --> 3:30:44.320\n 293,000 ether at the all time high over $1.2 billion.\n\n3:30:44.320 --> 3:30:46.040\n I gave it to my secretary.\n\n3:30:46.040 --> 3:30:47.960\n I had no idea if it was gonna be worth anything or not,\n\n3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:49.120\n but he kind of got shafted.\n\n3:30:49.120 --> 3:30:51.120\n And I was like, well, they don't like me,\n\n3:30:51.120 --> 3:30:53.120\n so they don't like you by the transitive property\n\n3:30:53.120 --> 3:30:55.600\n of relationships, so you're screwed.\n\n3:30:55.600 --> 3:30:56.720\n And he's like, well, I'm gonna go back\n\n3:30:56.720 --> 3:30:58.440\n and my wife is probably gonna divorce me\n\n3:30:58.440 --> 3:31:00.040\n and all this stuff, and what do I do?\n\n3:31:00.040 --> 3:31:01.120\n And I said, well, I'll give you my ether.\n\n3:31:01.120 --> 3:31:02.840\n I don't know if it's gonna be worth anything.\n\n3:31:02.840 --> 3:31:05.240\n So he's still pretty good.\n\n3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:09.200\n But then again, regardless of doing that,\n\n3:31:09.200 --> 3:31:11.360\n I now have Cordano, I have this great career,\n\n3:31:11.360 --> 3:31:12.760\n I've done all these amazing things.\n\n3:31:12.760 --> 3:31:16.040\n So I think that's the single best way of handling power\n\n3:31:16.040 --> 3:31:19.520\n is you have to do things to keep yourself grounded.\n\n3:31:19.520 --> 3:31:22.680\n Case of Washington, he was deeply connected to Mount Vernon\n\n3:31:22.680 --> 3:31:25.200\n during the Revolutionary War, he was like sending letters,\n\n3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:27.400\n talking about the irrigation ditches and the barn\n\n3:31:27.400 --> 3:31:28.440\n and things like that.\n\n3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:29.880\n He was always connected to that.\n\n3:31:29.880 --> 3:31:31.480\n And then also develop a mindset\n\n3:31:31.480 --> 3:31:34.240\n that you're only here temporarily.\n\n3:31:34.240 --> 3:31:35.680\n Everything you have is finite.\n\n3:31:35.680 --> 3:31:37.680\n It's going to go away at some point.\n\n3:31:37.680 --> 3:31:40.360\n No matter how much you want to keep it, you will die\n\n3:31:40.360 --> 3:31:42.480\n and somebody else will have it.\n\n3:31:42.480 --> 3:31:44.800\n So you live for the next generation.\n\n3:31:44.800 --> 3:31:45.800\n You don't live for yourself.\n\n3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:47.120\n You look to the future and you say,\n\n3:31:47.120 --> 3:31:48.400\n what am I going to leave behind?\n\n3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:50.000\n What am I going to transmit?\n\n3:31:50.000 --> 3:31:52.880\n And then in that kind of mindset always forces you\n\n3:31:52.880 --> 3:31:55.720\n to be more gracious, cooperative\n\n3:31:55.720 --> 3:31:57.160\n and collaborative with people.\n\n3:31:57.160 --> 3:32:00.680\n All these dictators, they are egomaniacs\n\n3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:02.880\n and they connected these fantasies\n\n3:32:02.880 --> 3:32:04.080\n and they live for themselves.\n\n3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:07.520\n Look at Xi in China, he's unraveling a power structure\n\n3:32:07.520 --> 3:32:10.520\n that was what made China, China today.\n\n3:32:10.520 --> 3:32:12.840\n After Mao, they said, we probably shouldn't have another\n\n3:32:12.840 --> 3:32:13.840\n one of those guys.\n\n3:32:13.840 --> 3:32:16.120\n And so they said, let's build something\n\n3:32:16.120 --> 3:32:17.840\n where there's checks and balances\n\n3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:21.120\n and no one person is going to run the whole show\n\n3:32:21.120 --> 3:32:24.320\n or else it'll descend and regress and we'll have problems.\n\n3:32:24.320 --> 3:32:27.200\n And then what he's done, he's thinking only about himself,\n\n3:32:27.200 --> 3:32:29.120\n not the best interest of China.\n\n3:32:29.120 --> 3:32:31.480\n So he's systematically unraveling a system\n\n3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:34.440\n they've been embracing for over 40 years.\n\n3:32:34.440 --> 3:32:35.880\n And to what end?\n\n3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:37.760\n After he dies, the next guy who comes in,\n\n3:32:37.760 --> 3:32:39.400\n even as he's super competent,\n\n3:32:39.400 --> 3:32:41.520\n the next guy is going to horrifically abuse\n\n3:32:41.520 --> 3:32:42.640\n that power structure.\n\n3:32:42.640 --> 3:32:45.160\n And the same thing happened with the Romans.\n\n3:32:45.160 --> 3:32:47.520\n After Augustus, the great emperor,\n\n3:32:47.520 --> 3:32:49.880\n then suddenly down the line you have Caligula\n\n3:32:49.880 --> 3:32:51.880\n and Nero and all these other terrible emperors\n\n3:32:51.880 --> 3:32:54.480\n that just destroyed everything that the Republic\n\n3:32:54.480 --> 3:32:56.560\n and the empire sought to achieve.\n\n3:32:56.560 --> 3:32:58.880\n So you have to think for the future,\n\n3:32:58.880 --> 3:33:01.120\n you have to think in institutions and systems,\n\n3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:03.280\n you have to have things that ground yourself\n\n3:33:03.280 --> 3:33:05.800\n and you have to be fully prepared to lose everything\n\n3:33:05.800 --> 3:33:07.080\n and give up everything.\n\n3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:10.040\n After I left Ethereum, I had nothing, okay?\n\n3:33:10.040 --> 3:33:12.920\n Reputation was damaged, not a lot of money,\n\n3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:14.120\n nobody really wanna work with me,\n\n3:33:14.120 --> 3:33:18.000\n no one pick up a phone for two whole years, it was horrible.\n\n3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:21.040\n And so I was at bedrock in that experience.\n\n3:33:21.040 --> 3:33:22.600\n And now look at where I'm at.\n\n3:33:22.600 --> 3:33:24.200\n I built all the way up to that.\n\n3:33:24.200 --> 3:33:25.960\n And so that wasn't by accident,\n\n3:33:25.960 --> 3:33:29.240\n it was I had to surround myself with amazing people.\n\n3:33:29.240 --> 3:33:31.080\n Why would amazing people wanna surround themselves\n\n3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:34.440\n with me if I was this narcissistic asshole\n\n3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:36.920\n who just was like, it's me, me, me,\n\n3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:41.320\n everything would be a transactional relationship.\n\n3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:43.200\n It would be okay, we'll get as much as we can\n\n3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:45.280\n and then run away as quickly as possible.\n\n3:33:45.280 --> 3:33:47.640\n Instead it was, I'm going to invest in you\n\n3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:49.480\n and maybe I'll win, maybe I won't win,\n\n3:33:49.480 --> 3:33:51.600\n but I'll be the last guy to leave the boat.\n\n3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:54.200\n If we're freezing to death, you get my coat\n\n3:33:54.200 --> 3:33:57.520\n and I'll just deal with the cold, that kind of mindset.\n\n3:33:57.520 --> 3:33:59.880\n You have to have that, I got that from my dad,\n\n3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:02.040\n he got it from his father.\n\n3:34:02.040 --> 3:34:04.160\n My grandfather and great grandfather,\n\n3:34:04.160 --> 3:34:05.600\n my dad said, I grew up in Montana\n\n3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:07.960\n and they were products of the Homestead Act.\n\n3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:09.920\n Very rough, Montana.\n\n3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:11.960\n A lot of people died and froze to death up there\n\n3:34:11.960 --> 3:34:13.280\n or eaten by animals or something\n\n3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:14.840\n or shot by their neighbors.\n\n3:34:14.840 --> 3:34:18.080\n And nobody investigates anything because it's Montana.\n\n3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:21.160\n So the only way you survive is by taking care\n\n3:34:21.160 --> 3:34:23.520\n of each other and being a good member of that community.\n\n3:34:23.520 --> 3:34:26.600\n And if somebody gets big, you have this implicit desire\n\n3:34:26.600 --> 3:34:29.240\n to go and give back and take care of the community\n\n3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:31.520\n that you came from and invest in that community.\n\n3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:32.920\n Like I came from the mathematical community.\n\n3:34:32.920 --> 3:34:35.480\n I never completed a PhD, but one of the things\n\n3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:38.120\n that I'm doing is I'm going to put $20 million\n\n3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:40.360\n and set up a center to do automated theorem proving\n\n3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:42.440\n and we're going to heavily invest in lean\n\n3:34:42.440 --> 3:34:44.640\n because I'm super excited about mechanizing math\n\n3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:46.400\n and making machine understandable.\n\n3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:48.280\n I know all these guys who do this work.\n\n3:34:48.280 --> 3:34:50.400\n There's like all these mathematicians\n\n3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:52.640\n and computer scientists and no one pays attention to them\n\n3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:54.680\n and they're kind of like the redheaded stepchildren\n\n3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:56.480\n of mathematics and they live on the boundaries\n\n3:34:56.480 --> 3:34:57.320\n and periphery.\n\n3:34:57.320 --> 3:34:58.880\n Meanwhile, they're super passionate\n\n3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:01.240\n and they absolutely love what they do.\n\n3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:05.200\n And if only they had the right resources,\n\n3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:07.480\n within 50 or 100 years, what they're doing\n\n3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:09.160\n can probably become the dominant model\n\n3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:10.800\n of how to do mathematics.\n\n3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:14.160\n So I'm now in a position where I have the financial means\n\n3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:15.800\n to take care of these guys.\n\n3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:18.080\n So all I have to do is just call them up and say,\n\n3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:20.840\n hey, would you like to work with, oh, absolutely\n\n3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:22.840\n and cut a check and it's done.\n\n3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:25.160\n So the interesting tension here,\n\n3:35:25.160 --> 3:35:27.960\n so we talked about ways to prevent power\n\n3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:30.240\n from corrupting a human being\n\n3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:32.000\n that's in a leadership position.\n\n3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:35.960\n There's an interesting case in the cryptocurrency space\n\n3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:38.560\n of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto\n\n3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:40.840\n that's basically doesn't have a leader.\n\n3:35:40.840 --> 3:35:45.840\n So the benefit of a leader is somebody that perhaps\n\n3:35:46.200 --> 3:35:48.480\n even when they don't carry power,\n\n3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:51.640\n maintains a little bit of a flame of a vision.\n\n3:35:52.800 --> 3:35:56.640\n I suppose Bitcoin has that with the original work\n\n3:35:56.640 --> 3:36:00.920\n by Satoshi Nakamoto and the sort of that,\n\n3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:02.600\n even though it's anonymous,\n\n3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:05.120\n the idea still lives on through the community,\n\n3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:08.440\n but nevertheless, the leader is anonymous.\n\n3:36:08.440 --> 3:36:11.960\n Do you think this is an interesting case study\n\n3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:16.880\n about leadership is for the leader to maintain anonymity?\n\n3:36:16.880 --> 3:36:19.400\n It was a saying from Sun Tzu, paraphrasing it,\n\n3:36:19.400 --> 3:36:21.560\n the best leaders are felt but never seen.\n\n3:36:22.640 --> 3:36:24.160\n So I think that's exactly right.\n\n3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:26.680\n The less the leader can be in the room\n\n3:36:26.680 --> 3:36:28.840\n and the more the principles of the leader are in the room,\n\n3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:29.920\n the better for the firm\n\n3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:32.480\n because what you're doing is creating more leaders that way.\n\n3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:34.440\n You're inspiring the next generation,\n\n3:36:34.440 --> 3:36:36.160\n the next wave, the next circle out\n\n3:36:36.160 --> 3:36:38.480\n to act with those principles,\n\n3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:41.160\n but contribute in their own way and their own flair.\n\n3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:43.040\n And so you gain collective intelligence\n\n3:36:43.040 --> 3:36:44.120\n inside the organization\n\n3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:45.760\n instead of just constraining yourself\n\n3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:48.240\n to however the great the leader can be.\n\n3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:50.600\n The other side of it is if the leader's principles\n\n3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:52.760\n are too strong, so this is the dark side of it,\n\n3:36:52.760 --> 3:36:56.240\n you end up having Disney with Walt Disney after he died.\n\n3:36:56.240 --> 3:36:58.200\n For 20 years, people said, we don't do that\n\n3:36:58.200 --> 3:37:00.600\n because Walt Disney wouldn't do it that way.\n\n3:37:00.600 --> 3:37:03.320\n Or to a lesser extent, Apple is the only don't do that\n\n3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:05.400\n because Steve Jobs wouldn't do it that way.\n\n3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:06.920\n Well, he's dead, he's gone.\n\n3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:07.760\n Move on.\n\n3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:10.600\n So somebody, I think, asked you whether you're a clone\n\n3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:14.000\n or a deep fake, and you said that you admitted,\n\n3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:17.320\n you slipped up on video saying that you're a deep fake.\n\n3:37:17.320 --> 3:37:18.160\n So on that talk.\n\n3:37:18.160 --> 3:37:20.920\n I'm actually a poker playing robot that escaped a lab.\n\n3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:22.280\n The truth finally comes out,\n\n3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:23.640\n but I said on that topic,\n\n3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:25.600\n who do you think is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.160\n Is it possible that you are, in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n3:37:29.160 --> 3:37:30.000\n No.\n\n3:37:32.280 --> 3:37:35.720\n If you have a preponderance of the evidence,\n\n3:37:35.720 --> 3:37:39.040\n I think the most likely candidate would be Adam Back.\n\n3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:41.160\n It's the Occam's razor candidate.\n\n3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:43.760\n And mostly because he's the right place, right time,\n\n3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:46.080\n right age, right skillset.\n\n3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:48.440\n If you look at the design of Bitcoin,\n\n3:37:48.440 --> 3:37:49.440\n the types of decisions,\n\n3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:52.000\n like the use of fourth, the scripting language,\n\n3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:54.760\n it was pretty common in English and European pedagogy\n\n3:37:54.760 --> 3:37:56.120\n in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n3:37:56.120 --> 3:37:58.920\n It was like an example language for a stack based assembly\n\n3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:01.800\n and like little stuff like that, little quirks like that.\n\n3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:03.080\n Also, he created Hashcash,\n\n3:38:03.080 --> 3:38:05.200\n which was the predecessor of proof of work.\n\n3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:06.600\n He just kind of got a chip on his shoulder\n\n3:38:06.600 --> 3:38:08.840\n that Microsoft never did anything with it.\n\n3:38:08.840 --> 3:38:10.200\n So he's probably looking for something.\n\n3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:11.800\n He grew up with all the cypherpunks.\n\n3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:13.640\n He knew of Hal Finney.\n\n3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:15.280\n He knew of all these people.\n\n3:38:15.280 --> 3:38:16.120\n He knew Phil Zimmerman.\n\n3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:17.160\n You don't think it's Hal Finney?\n\n3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:21.000\n Well, no, because the code was not good enough.\n\n3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:23.160\n Hal was a Unix, Linux guy.\n\n3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:24.920\n He was a talented programmer.\n\n3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:26.480\n He was a talented developer.\n\n3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:28.640\n The initial code for Bitcoin was developed\n\n3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:30.360\n to look like on a Windows machine.\n\n3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:33.560\n Adam worked at Microsoft, go figure.\n\n3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:36.320\n And also it was very academic and it had to be cleaned up\n\n3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:38.920\n and a lot of things had to be patched up and fixed.\n\n3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:40.800\n If a guy like Hal developed it,\n\n3:38:40.800 --> 3:38:43.760\n they probably had less of the,\n\n3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:47.400\n let's use secp256k1 and these types of things\n\n3:38:47.400 --> 3:38:48.720\n and more of like, hey,\n\n3:38:48.720 --> 3:38:50.760\n let's build this cool engineering thing\n\n3:38:50.760 --> 3:38:53.280\n and we'll figure out the protocol design later on.\n\n3:38:53.280 --> 3:38:56.520\n It just stinks of an older academic,\n\n3:38:56.520 --> 3:38:58.000\n the initial design of Bitcoin\n\n3:38:58.000 --> 3:38:59.480\n and the initial rollout of Bitcoin.\n\n3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:02.000\n And then brilliant people like Greg Maxwell and others,\n\n3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:03.840\n they came and cleaned it all up.\n\n3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:05.520\n And lo and behold, where's Adam?\n\n3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:08.360\n Like the CEO of the largest Bitcoin development company\n\n3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:10.520\n in the space who's trying to keep working on\n\n3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:11.760\n and building out Bitcoin.\n\n3:39:11.760 --> 3:39:14.840\n And where the hell was Adam when Satoshi was around?\n\n3:39:14.840 --> 3:39:17.080\n I don't think there was any overlap\n\n3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:19.640\n where they were both together at the same period of time.\n\n3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:22.760\n But I mean, if you really care, you could even do this.\n\n3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:25.320\n There's a lovely paper written by the US Army.\n\n3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:28.560\n If you just Google like code stalometry US Army,\n\n3:39:28.560 --> 3:39:31.720\n it's a technique where you can use ML\n\n3:39:31.720 --> 3:39:33.720\n and a few other things to actually kind of develop\n\n3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:36.320\n a fingerprint for the way that people write code.\n\n3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:39.320\n So all you gotta do is take the original Bitcoin source code\n\n3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:41.600\n and then take all the open source repos\n\n3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:43.640\n from around that time period and before\n\n3:39:43.640 --> 3:39:46.600\n and see if there's a match between those two.\n\n3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:49.560\n Now, if he's really good at creating an alias,\n\n3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:52.240\n probably not so good at obfuscating the code\n\n3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:53.120\n that was written.\n\n3:39:53.120 --> 3:39:55.320\n So the odds are that you'd probably find a match\n\n3:39:55.320 --> 3:39:58.120\n to a repo that's connected to a real life human identity\n\n3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:01.880\n or at least a weaker opsec because you're younger,\n\n3:40:01.880 --> 3:40:03.000\n you have weaker opsec.\n\n3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:04.160\n Do you know if people have tried that?\n\n3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:05.760\n I don't think anybody's actually done it,\n\n3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:07.320\n but there's actually a beautiful paper.\n\n3:40:07.320 --> 3:40:09.760\n It's like 94% accurate, the code stalometry.\n\n3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:10.600\n The code stalometry.\n\n3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:15.120\n So I've, for various reasons, I've worked with people\n\n3:40:15.120 --> 3:40:17.760\n that work on stalometry of natural language.\n\n3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:18.720\n Okay.\n\n3:40:18.720 --> 3:40:22.240\n And I think it matches closest to Nick Sabo\n\n3:40:22.240 --> 3:40:26.440\n if you actually do the written stalometry analysis\n\n3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:28.400\n of Satoshi's writings to Sabo's.\n\n3:40:28.400 --> 3:40:30.040\n So I meant stalometry as a field.\n\n3:40:30.040 --> 3:40:31.760\n I didn't actually look for application\n\n3:40:31.760 --> 3:40:33.560\n for this particular problem.\n\n3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:36.520\n But so you're saying Nick Sabo is the closest match.\n\n3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:37.800\n Yeah, somebody did it years.\n\n3:40:37.800 --> 3:40:39.800\n I didn't look at if the model was sound or not,\n\n3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:41.480\n but I just remember reading on a Bitcoin talk\n\n3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:44.240\n and Sabo was another one of the common candidates.\n\n3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:48.000\n How many Sabo and Adam are probably the top three things\n\n3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:48.840\n that people could list.\n\n3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:51.080\n What do you think about this idea of anonymity,\n\n3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:53.040\n of publishing something anonymously?\n\n3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:55.080\n Would you ever consider publishing a paper?\n\n3:40:55.080 --> 3:40:59.680\n You've been part of, I mean, the Cardano ecosystem\n\n3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:01.840\n has published a lot of incredible papers.\n\n3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:04.080\n Is there ever a value to publish anonymously?\n\n3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:07.000\n Well, every paper that goes through the referee process,\n\n3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:08.400\n the authors are ripped off.\n\n3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:10.320\n So you don't actually see the authorship\n\n3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:12.320\n when you submit to the conference.\n\n3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:14.360\n So that's just best practice.\n\n3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:16.200\n But the question is, do you preserve the anonymity\n\n3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:18.920\n post conference and actually not reveal\n\n3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:20.160\n the author of the paper?\n\n3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:22.920\n It's a detriment for the deals we make\n\n3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:25.640\n because the whole premise of working with our company\n\n3:41:25.640 --> 3:41:28.920\n as an academic is that you're gonna have amazing coauthors\n\n3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:31.080\n and your work is gonna appear in great conferences,\n\n3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:33.840\n great journals, and as a consequence, you get tenure.\n\n3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:38.400\n If you publish anonymously, it's like doing clearance work\n\n3:41:38.400 --> 3:41:40.960\n in high energy physics or something like that.\n\n3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:42.840\n After 30 years of this amazing career\n\n3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:45.640\n working on nuclear weapons and classified reactors,\n\n3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:48.080\n you finish and then you go to apply for a job\n\n3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:48.960\n and they're like, so what have you done\n\n3:41:48.960 --> 3:41:50.000\n for the last 30 years?\n\n3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:51.040\n Stuff.\n\n3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:53.560\n Where is it on your CV?\n\n3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:55.240\n Well, I can't really talk about it.\n\n3:41:55.240 --> 3:41:57.640\n Okay, welcome to community college.\n\n3:41:57.640 --> 3:41:59.800\n So you get really screwed if you do that.\n\n3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:01.640\n So there's a misalignment of incentives\n\n3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:04.560\n in the academic world towards anonymity.\n\n3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:07.520\n And generally it's only done when you're doing something\n\n3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:09.760\n very controversial or there's a whistleblowing\n\n3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:10.960\n type of a component.\n\n3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:13.680\n It's not typically done for foundational work.\n\n3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:15.440\n And Satoshi was really one of the first things\n\n3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:17.800\n because like if there was a, Satoshi docks themselves,\n\n3:42:17.800 --> 3:42:19.640\n and I don't think it's possible anymore,\n\n3:42:19.640 --> 3:42:21.640\n but if he or she did that,\n\n3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:24.600\n that's like a Nobel Prize in economics likely.\n\n3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:26.680\n You're on the short list for that.\n\n3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:28.920\n And there's enormous accolades that would come\n\n3:42:28.920 --> 3:42:30.520\n beyond the monetary incentives\n\n3:42:30.520 --> 3:42:32.320\n of being able to docks yourself.\n\n3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:37.280\n That'd be cool if they give a Nobel Prize in economics\n\n3:42:37.280 --> 3:42:39.360\n to an anonymous, to Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n3:42:39.360 --> 3:42:41.720\n It's been proposed and it was turned down.\n\n3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:44.680\n Yeah, so yeah, I mean, there are a few people\n\n3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:47.520\n in our company that have done pseudonymous publications.\n\n3:42:47.520 --> 3:42:49.840\n Like the, if you look at the Chimerical Edgers paper,\n\n3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:52.600\n that's a, it's not a real name, it's a crazy name.\n\n3:42:52.600 --> 3:42:55.280\n It's a pseudonymous publication.\n\n3:42:55.280 --> 3:42:58.400\n And you know, but that's usually for throwaway work.\n\n3:42:58.400 --> 3:43:01.120\n There is one project we inherited from an anonymous person,\n\n3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:02.200\n which is fascinating.\n\n3:43:02.200 --> 3:43:03.760\n It's called Cueditas.\n\n3:43:03.760 --> 3:43:06.920\n And it's basically a extension of the Cued manifesto\n\n3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:08.080\n from the 90s.\n\n3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:10.160\n And the pseudonym is Bill White.\n\n3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:12.200\n And I think it's some anonymous mathematician,\n\n3:43:12.200 --> 3:43:14.160\n but I can't figure out which one it is.\n\n3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:16.360\n But basically it's a marketplace for deduction.\n\n3:43:16.360 --> 3:43:19.120\n So it's like this magic machine\n\n3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:20.900\n where you can create incentives for people\n\n3:43:20.900 --> 3:43:23.120\n to write mathematical proofs in a theorem prover\n\n3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:24.440\n and make some money from it.\n\n3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:26.800\n So there's some cool work that's there.\n\n3:43:26.800 --> 3:43:29.120\n And it's sad that Bill stayed anonymous\n\n3:43:29.120 --> 3:43:31.000\n because I think that could have been easily published.\n\n3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:32.280\n And there was a lot of really cool things\n\n3:43:32.280 --> 3:43:34.440\n that could have been done with Cueditas.\n\n3:43:34.440 --> 3:43:36.400\n So you did say the success of Cardano,\n\n3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:39.520\n sort of the vision you have is for you to have less\n\n3:43:39.520 --> 3:43:41.340\n and less power over time.\n\n3:43:41.340 --> 3:43:44.440\n So this idea of governance, what's your vision\n\n3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:48.280\n for a decentralized secure governance system?\n\n3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:50.180\n So the first thing you have to do is you've got to look\n\n3:43:50.180 --> 3:43:53.040\n at meaningful metrics, not vanity metrics.\n\n3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:55.880\n So what does it mean to have legitimacy\n\n3:43:55.880 --> 3:43:56.720\n in a governance system?\n\n3:43:56.720 --> 3:43:58.600\n You can build any governance system you want.\n\n3:43:58.600 --> 3:43:59.880\n You can have a dictator, right?\n\n3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:01.280\n Like Bob is in charge.\n\n3:44:01.280 --> 3:44:04.380\n It's like whether you like Bob or not, he's in charge.\n\n3:44:04.380 --> 3:44:05.640\n That's not very legitimate.\n\n3:44:05.640 --> 3:44:06.960\n And you can have pure democracy\n\n3:44:06.960 --> 3:44:08.480\n where every single person votes\n\n3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:10.320\n and then nothing ever gets done.\n\n3:44:10.320 --> 3:44:12.920\n County dog catcher is like a six year election\n\n3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:14.140\n or something like that.\n\n3:44:14.140 --> 3:44:17.360\n So there's a spectrum there between absolute power to one\n\n3:44:17.360 --> 3:44:20.240\n and perfectly egalitarian power\n\n3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:23.600\n to every single potential participant inside the system.\n\n3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:24.980\n And then the question is, okay,\n\n3:44:24.980 --> 3:44:28.240\n well, how do you handle choice architecture in that?\n\n3:44:28.240 --> 3:44:31.960\n So are you asking your people about every question\n\n3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:34.000\n or are you asking your people about a subset\n\n3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.380\n of questions related to a particular set of topics,\n\n3:44:36.380 --> 3:44:38.720\n but then they're not allowed to talk about other topics?\n\n3:44:38.720 --> 3:44:39.720\n Like for example, are they allowed\n\n3:44:39.720 --> 3:44:40.720\n to change the tax rate,\n\n3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:42.520\n but they can't change freedom of speech,\n\n3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:43.760\n that kind of a thing.\n\n3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:45.800\n So the first thing you have to do\n\n3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:47.220\n when you build these types of systems\n\n3:44:47.220 --> 3:44:48.960\n and they get to a certain scale\n\n3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:50.860\n is you have to build some mechanism\n\n3:44:50.860 --> 3:44:52.760\n for people who are interested in governance\n\n3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:54.980\n to self select and participate.\n\n3:44:54.980 --> 3:44:56.800\n Just create a collection bucket.\n\n3:44:56.800 --> 3:44:58.460\n In Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin talk\n\n3:44:58.460 --> 3:44:59.960\n and Bitcoin Reddit and these things.\n\n3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:02.200\n And eventually the GitHub repos and these things,\n\n3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:04.780\n there was a place to go if you were interested.\n\n3:45:04.780 --> 3:45:06.760\n And you need some sort of change management system\n\n3:45:06.760 --> 3:45:08.780\n where people who want to evolve the system\n\n3:45:08.780 --> 3:45:10.520\n can write it down in a very careful way.\n\n3:45:10.520 --> 3:45:11.440\n So in Bitcoin's case,\n\n3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:13.880\n it was Bitcoin Improvement Proposal on Ethereum.\n\n3:45:13.880 --> 3:45:15.560\n It's the Ethereum Improvement Proposal.\n\n3:45:15.560 --> 3:45:18.360\n And for us, it's the SIP, the Cardano Improvement Proposal.\n\n3:45:18.360 --> 3:45:20.080\n But just a structured way of discussing\n\n3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:21.360\n how you wish to change.\n\n3:45:21.360 --> 3:45:22.820\n Then there's a question of,\n\n3:45:22.820 --> 3:45:25.840\n do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly?\n\n3:45:25.840 --> 3:45:28.840\n The case of Bitcoin in Ethereum, it's an implicit system.\n\n3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:30.760\n So there's no on chain voting.\n\n3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:32.760\n There's no like five people said this\n\n3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:34.880\n and four people said this, so we do this.\n\n3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:37.360\n The case of Cardano, we're actually explicitly inviting.\n\n3:45:37.360 --> 3:45:39.280\n This is one of the biggest differentiators\n\n3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:41.560\n between Cardano, Polkadot, and these other things\n\n3:45:41.560 --> 3:45:43.760\n is that we're really serious about governance\n\n3:45:43.760 --> 3:45:46.820\n to the extent that we're actually doing foundational\n\n3:45:46.820 --> 3:45:47.880\n research in eVoting.\n\n3:45:47.880 --> 3:45:49.440\n We're building new voting systems,\n\n3:45:49.440 --> 3:45:51.960\n we're exploring preference voting and quadratic voting.\n\n3:45:51.960 --> 3:45:53.840\n And the long and the short is that we want\n\n3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:57.720\n more and more people to participate in voting for things.\n\n3:45:57.720 --> 3:45:59.620\n And you just have to start somewhere.\n\n3:45:59.620 --> 3:46:02.620\n So our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system\n\n3:46:02.620 --> 3:46:05.800\n with the treasury system.\n\n3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:09.040\n So in Cardano, some of the inflation goes\n\n3:46:09.040 --> 3:46:11.760\n to the block producers, just like any other cryptocurrency,\n\n3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:14.480\n but some goes into a decentralized treasury,\n\n3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:17.240\n which now has over a billion dollars of ADA in it.\n\n3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:18.680\n So it's a lot of money.\n\n3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:20.680\n And that treasury is not under my control\n\n3:46:20.680 --> 3:46:22.080\n or the foundation's control,\n\n3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:24.820\n it's actually controlled by the community as a whole\n\n3:46:24.820 --> 3:46:26.400\n through a program called Catalyst.\n\n3:46:26.400 --> 3:46:28.000\n And so all these people can come together\n\n3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:29.440\n and they can submit spending ballots\n\n3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:32.440\n and other people who hold ADA can vote to approve that.\n\n3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:34.580\n What's nice about it is you have a growth engine\n\n3:46:34.580 --> 3:46:36.760\n to improve two accesses.\n\n3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:38.680\n One is absolute participation.\n\n3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:40.640\n So increase the amount of people\n\n3:46:40.640 --> 3:46:42.240\n who hold ADA participating.\n\n3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:44.360\n So the absolute number of people participating.\n\n3:46:44.360 --> 3:46:46.680\n And the other is meaningful participation.\n\n3:46:46.680 --> 3:46:48.240\n So the depth of participation.\n\n3:46:48.240 --> 3:46:49.880\n Did you just show up and vote?\n\n3:46:49.880 --> 3:46:53.320\n Or did you spend hours debating things on idea scale,\n\n3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:54.960\n the innovation management platform,\n\n3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:56.660\n interacting with the funding proposal,\n\n3:46:56.660 --> 3:46:57.840\n going back and forth.\n\n3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:00.340\n And there's dozens of little things like that.\n\n3:47:00.340 --> 3:47:02.000\n Now, my hypothesis is if you run this\n\n3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:02.920\n with enough iterations,\n\n3:47:02.920 --> 3:47:05.360\n eventually you get to a certain critical mass,\n\n3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:07.640\n like over 50% absolute participation\n\n3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:09.960\n and a high level of meaningful participation,\n\n3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:12.140\n where you can move beyond funding\n\n3:47:12.140 --> 3:47:14.760\n and you can start actually having meaningful questions\n\n3:47:14.760 --> 3:47:17.540\n about protocol design and improvement proposals\n\n3:47:17.540 --> 3:47:18.380\n and so forth.\n\n3:47:18.380 --> 3:47:20.280\n And then what you can do is you can roll out\n\n3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:22.720\n new voting systems and new social structures,\n\n3:47:22.720 --> 3:47:25.120\n and you can let them start voting on training wheels\n\n3:47:25.120 --> 3:47:26.140\n like system parameters.\n\n3:47:26.140 --> 3:47:28.220\n Like for example, the minimum transaction fee\n\n3:47:28.220 --> 3:47:30.320\n or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools\n\n3:47:30.320 --> 3:47:32.120\n or these types of things.\n\n3:47:32.120 --> 3:47:34.080\n Then they build enough competency there\n\n3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:35.700\n and they move up a next level.\n\n3:47:35.700 --> 3:47:37.480\n And they actually start talking about hard forks\n\n3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:40.360\n using the update system, the hard fork combinator system.\n\n3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:41.200\n See, so that's how you.\n\n3:47:41.200 --> 3:47:42.800\n Voting on a hard fork.\n\n3:47:42.800 --> 3:47:44.000\n Voting on a hard fork.\n\n3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:46.320\n You can't do it unless your social dynamics are right\n\n3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:47.420\n and your voting system is right.\n\n3:47:47.420 --> 3:47:49.520\n And by the way, you also need to write a constitution\n\n3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:50.840\n around the same time\n\n3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:53.440\n because not all hard forks are created equally.\n\n3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:55.200\n The kinds of things that would add support\n\n3:47:55.200 --> 3:47:57.480\n for a new cryptographic primitive\n\n3:47:57.480 --> 3:47:59.240\n are distinctly different from the kinds of things\n\n3:47:59.240 --> 3:48:02.040\n that would change your monetary policy of the system.\n\n3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:04.680\n So the constitution would be written,\n\n3:48:04.680 --> 3:48:05.800\n and maybe you can comment on\n\n3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:09.040\n what is the innovation management proposal system?\n\n3:48:09.040 --> 3:48:11.120\n So we partnered with a company called Ideascale\n\n3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:13.280\n and they run a kind of a side platform.\n\n3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:15.360\n So people who are interested,\n\n3:48:15.360 --> 3:48:16.840\n that's kind of our version of a forum.\n\n3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:19.240\n They sign up and there's special tools in that platform\n\n3:48:19.240 --> 3:48:21.200\n for discussions that are productive.\n\n3:48:21.200 --> 3:48:22.400\n So they don't descend into kind of like\n\n3:48:22.400 --> 3:48:24.440\n trolly Reddit style conversations,\n\n3:48:24.440 --> 3:48:26.400\n but they're much more focused around\n\n3:48:26.400 --> 3:48:28.240\n how is your product building out.\n\n3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:29.900\n And by the way, we're gonna add more infrastructure\n\n3:48:29.900 --> 3:48:30.740\n over time.\n\n3:48:30.740 --> 3:48:32.440\n Our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson,\n\n3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:35.360\n she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator.\n\n3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:36.920\n And we have lots of cool partners\n\n3:48:36.920 --> 3:48:38.160\n we've talked with in that space.\n\n3:48:38.160 --> 3:48:39.480\n And it's the same concept.\n\n3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:41.000\n Your idea comes in,\n\n3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.180\n what enters the system should not be\n\n3:48:43.180 --> 3:48:44.740\n what gets approved on the other side.\n\n3:48:44.740 --> 3:48:46.260\n It should go through some sort of gauntlet,\n\n3:48:46.260 --> 3:48:49.120\n some sort of crucible where you iterate your way through\n\n3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:51.800\n and there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades\n\n3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:53.760\n and evolutions and combinations\n\n3:48:53.760 --> 3:48:55.120\n and destructions that occur.\n\n3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:56.440\n And then by the time you get to the other side,\n\n3:48:56.440 --> 3:48:58.520\n either the idea just dies on the vine\n\n3:48:58.520 --> 3:48:59.720\n because it was a bad idea,\n\n3:48:59.720 --> 3:49:03.080\n or it's a significantly stronger, far more fundable thing\n\n3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:05.280\n and potentially even gets attached with accountability.\n\n3:49:05.280 --> 3:49:06.920\n So you don't just fund the idea,\n\n3:49:06.920 --> 3:49:09.520\n you'd actually fund the auditor at the same time\n\n3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:10.880\n who actually holds the person accountable\n\n3:49:10.880 --> 3:49:12.840\n because the blockchain is not a real company.\n\n3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:14.680\n It's an ethereal thing.\n\n3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:16.920\n You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable\n\n3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:19.960\n who's real for that type of stuff and that type of funding.\n\n3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:21.400\n So that's what we're doing this year.\n\n3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:23.080\n So we have a whole team of people,\n\n3:49:23.080 --> 3:49:25.680\n partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale\n\n3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:29.120\n and papers we've written and about 30, 40,000 people\n\n3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:30.560\n regularly participating in this.\n\n3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:32.480\n So it's a huge social experiment\n\n3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:34.240\n and we're learning an enormous amount.\n\n3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:35.800\n And then our goal is by the end of the year\n\n3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:37.520\n to have a meaningful percentage\n\n3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:39.720\n of the entire Cardinal population inside of it,\n\n3:49:39.720 --> 3:49:41.360\n like 40, 50%.\n\n3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:42.680\n Then once you're at that threshold,\n\n3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:46.280\n now you have democratic majority of the entire system\n\n3:49:46.280 --> 3:49:48.060\n and you can have a real conversation about,\n\n3:49:48.060 --> 3:49:50.280\n okay, how do we write a constitution\n\n3:49:50.280 --> 3:49:51.520\n for this type of a system?\n\n3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:54.640\n And sorry to interrupt, but so the constitution,\n\n3:49:54.640 --> 3:49:57.440\n people still argue about it because natural language,\n\n3:49:57.440 --> 3:50:00.680\n much like poetry, lends itself to multiple interpretations.\n\n3:50:00.680 --> 3:50:03.880\n Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas\n\n3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:07.560\n that reduce the ambiguity?\n\n3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:09.000\n Everything's old is new again.\n\n3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:12.120\n We were talking about Lojban back in the day, right?\n\n3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:15.140\n So there's definitely formal languages you can use\n\n3:50:15.140 --> 3:50:15.980\n to express these things.\n\n3:50:15.980 --> 3:50:18.360\n This is why I'm so interested in things like Idris and Koch\n\n3:50:18.360 --> 3:50:21.000\n and Acta and theorem proving,\n\n3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.000\n because that's exactly what you're attempting to do\n\n3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:27.400\n is to express some concept or desire or construction\n\n3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:29.040\n in a language that's machine understandable\n\n3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:30.120\n and manipulatable.\n\n3:50:30.120 --> 3:50:33.280\n In particular, how does the system know its own design?\n\n3:50:33.280 --> 3:50:35.480\n So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?\n\n3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:37.120\n Usually it's a canonical code base,\n\n3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:40.000\n like here's Bitcoin core and the C++ code\n\n3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:42.600\n is that is the canonical code base.\n\n3:50:42.600 --> 3:50:43.680\n But actually that's not right.\n\n3:50:43.680 --> 3:50:46.400\n You should have specifications, blueprints\n\n3:50:46.400 --> 3:50:47.860\n that are implementation agnostic\n\n3:50:47.860 --> 3:50:49.200\n as your canonical code base.\n\n3:50:49.200 --> 3:50:51.400\n And can your system know those specifications,\n\n3:50:51.400 --> 3:50:52.860\n understand those specifications,\n\n3:50:52.860 --> 3:50:55.520\n and can your change management system be for that?\n\n3:50:55.520 --> 3:50:57.140\n And then can you provide a proof\n\n3:50:57.140 --> 3:51:00.380\n that your client is by similar to that specification?\n\n3:51:00.380 --> 3:51:02.200\n So yeah, that's 10 years in the future,\n\n3:51:02.200 --> 3:51:05.240\n but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept.\n\n3:51:05.240 --> 3:51:07.960\n But you're tending towards a formalism.\n\n3:51:08.820 --> 3:51:10.820\n Eventually, but that's not necessary\n\n3:51:10.820 --> 3:51:12.300\n for the system in the short term.\n\n3:51:12.300 --> 3:51:14.920\n It's good enough just to have,\n\n3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:17.560\n I know in a winter and say the Haskell client is that,\n\n3:51:17.560 --> 3:51:21.260\n and then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP\n\n3:51:21.260 --> 3:51:23.280\n and then once it's approved,\n\n3:51:23.280 --> 3:51:24.480\n then you go and implement that.\n\n3:51:24.480 --> 3:51:26.560\n And there's some mechanism to trigger the update system,\n\n3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:27.400\n to update the reference client.\n\n3:51:27.400 --> 3:51:29.160\n Do you have an example of a SIP,\n\n3:51:29.160 --> 3:51:31.120\n a Cardano Improvement Proposal?\n\n3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:34.360\n Yeah, like the Curb Benefit Pledge, SIP 007.\n\n3:51:34.360 --> 3:51:37.240\n So the...\n\n3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:38.360\n 007.\n\n3:51:38.360 --> 3:51:40.880\n Yeah, everybody loves that.\n\n3:51:40.880 --> 3:51:41.720\n Yeah, key.\n\n3:51:41.720 --> 3:51:44.400\n I'm gonna change my luggage code now, Lex.\n\n3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:45.240\n What is that?\n\n3:51:45.240 --> 3:51:50.080\n So basically it just has to do with the pledge.\n\n3:51:50.080 --> 3:51:52.320\n So a pledge is a certain amount of ADA\n\n3:51:52.320 --> 3:51:54.640\n that a stake pool operator will set aside\n\n3:51:54.640 --> 3:51:57.960\n and connect to his pool in order to be listed\n\n3:51:57.960 --> 3:51:59.760\n in the registry.\n\n3:51:59.760 --> 3:52:02.760\n And actually it's connected to how much income you make\n\n3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:03.980\n as a pool operator.\n\n3:52:03.980 --> 3:52:07.480\n So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation,\n\n3:52:07.480 --> 3:52:08.680\n you have lots of pools.\n\n3:52:08.680 --> 3:52:11.060\n If you set it too low, what will happen is larger pools\n\n3:52:11.060 --> 3:52:12.540\n will tend to fragment\n\n3:52:12.540 --> 3:52:15.480\n and actually run multiple instances of themselves.\n\n3:52:15.480 --> 3:52:18.040\n And so this is delicate parameter that you have to tweak.\n\n3:52:18.040 --> 3:52:19.980\n And so we have a formula for it,\n\n3:52:19.980 --> 3:52:22.040\n our formal specification that's quite involved.\n\n3:52:22.040 --> 3:52:23.720\n And so one of the community members came and said,\n\n3:52:23.720 --> 3:52:27.120\n well, I think we can massively simplify this design\n\n3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:28.600\n and actually get a better result\n\n3:52:28.600 --> 3:52:30.880\n for smaller stake pool operators.\n\n3:52:30.880 --> 3:52:33.120\n And so it's SIP 007.\n\n3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:34.640\n And there's actually a lot of conversation\n\n3:52:34.640 --> 3:52:35.640\n and people are thinking about it.\n\n3:52:35.640 --> 3:52:37.520\n And it was just stunning for me\n\n3:52:37.520 --> 3:52:39.600\n because to understand how to write a SIP like this,\n\n3:52:39.600 --> 3:52:41.400\n you actually have to read like a hundred pages\n\n3:52:41.400 --> 3:52:44.720\n of mathematical prose in the formal specification.\n\n3:52:44.720 --> 3:52:47.480\n So the guys who wrote it, I was like, fuck yeah.\n\n3:52:47.480 --> 3:52:48.680\n This is great.\n\n3:52:48.680 --> 3:52:49.880\n I'll just say an example of a SIP,\n\n3:52:49.880 --> 3:52:52.520\n but that's one thing, but it could be as big as,\n\n3:52:52.520 --> 3:52:55.560\n hey, I wanna add like quantum resistance to the system.\n\n3:52:55.560 --> 3:52:56.760\n And here's how you do that,\n\n3:52:56.760 --> 3:52:59.480\n like quantum VRF and I wanna put XMSS\n\n3:52:59.480 --> 3:53:00.680\n and all this other stuff.\n\n3:53:00.680 --> 3:53:02.080\n So there's a lot you can do\n\n3:53:02.080 --> 3:53:07.080\n and you can do it indirectly or implicitly\n\n3:53:07.400 --> 3:53:10.080\n where there's some social process outside of the system\n\n3:53:10.080 --> 3:53:12.400\n where you eventually approve a SIP,\n\n3:53:12.400 --> 3:53:14.600\n or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote\n\n3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:16.880\n or some representative democracy,\n\n3:53:16.880 --> 3:53:19.200\n some group of representatives directly votes.\n\n3:53:19.200 --> 3:53:21.160\n And then once you've decided it's there.\n\n3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:22.400\n The constitution is necessary\n\n3:53:22.400 --> 3:53:24.680\n because you need to know the decision threshold.\n\n3:53:24.680 --> 3:53:26.960\n Is it super majority or majority?\n\n3:53:26.960 --> 3:53:29.040\n And also the voting process.\n\n3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:30.760\n Like a lot of policy experts believe\n\n3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:32.880\n that if Brexit was a multi stage vote,\n\n3:53:32.880 --> 3:53:34.400\n it would have never passed\n\n3:53:34.400 --> 3:53:36.480\n because people would have done the initial stage\n\n3:53:36.480 --> 3:53:37.760\n and all the horrors of Brexit\n\n3:53:37.760 --> 3:53:39.520\n would have been broadcast to society.\n\n3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:41.160\n And then there would have been some reluctance\n\n3:53:41.160 --> 3:53:42.920\n and buyer's remorse on it.\n\n3:53:42.920 --> 3:53:44.560\n And then the second round would have failed\n\n3:53:44.560 --> 3:53:45.960\n or something like that.\n\n3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:48.200\n But because it was just a singular event,\n\n3:53:48.200 --> 3:53:50.200\n it's like they passed it now,\n\n3:53:50.200 --> 3:53:52.960\n British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign.\n\n3:53:52.960 --> 3:53:55.680\n Very well, we shall remove from Europe.\n\n3:53:55.680 --> 3:53:58.680\n And so your voting system has a lot to do\n\n3:53:58.680 --> 3:53:59.840\n with the outcome you get.\n\n3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:01.520\n The other thing is, what type of voting?\n\n3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:04.160\n Is it just an absolute or is it a preference voting?\n\n3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:06.200\n So you pick your favorite SIP,\n\n3:54:06.200 --> 3:54:08.880\n follow your second favorite SIP or something like that.\n\n3:54:08.880 --> 3:54:11.120\n So Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems like that.\n\n3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:13.120\n Are you a fan of those, like the ranked choice vote?\n\n3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:16.360\n I love them so much, especially for political diversity\n\n3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:18.800\n because this whole concept of throwing your vote away,\n\n3:54:18.800 --> 3:54:21.160\n if it's Alice or Bob, you're always gonna get a,\n\n3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:23.560\n it's South Park did it best, right?\n\n3:54:23.560 --> 3:54:24.640\n The giant.\n\n3:54:24.640 --> 3:54:25.480\n Turd.\n\n3:54:25.480 --> 3:54:26.600\n Yeah, yeah, you know the one.\n\n3:54:26.600 --> 3:54:29.640\n Turd versus I forget what else, Douche versus Turd.\n\n3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:31.760\n Douche versus Turd, South Park.\n\n3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:34.480\n So if it's ranked order or preference voting,\n\n3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:35.640\n you never have that situation\n\n3:54:35.640 --> 3:54:36.800\n because you always pick your favorite\n\n3:54:36.800 --> 3:54:38.560\n and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot.\n\n3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:39.840\n But then you have arrows paradox\n\n3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:41.800\n and all these other things that come up.\n\n3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:44.000\n So there's no perfect system.\n\n3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:47.480\n And really you have to be comfortable with governance\n\n3:54:47.480 --> 3:54:48.840\n in a game of inches.\n\n3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:51.240\n And you start by some guiding principles.\n\n3:54:51.240 --> 3:54:53.460\n And the guiding principles is more is better\n\n3:54:53.460 --> 3:54:55.920\n and productive interactions are better\n\n3:54:55.920 --> 3:54:57.240\n than destructive interactions.\n\n3:54:57.240 --> 3:54:58.840\n And you have to be able to quantify those things.\n\n3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:00.560\n As long as you have an engine that allows you\n\n3:55:00.560 --> 3:55:02.160\n to grow in those directions,\n\n3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:04.120\n then you have a lot more people on for the ride\n\n3:55:04.120 --> 3:55:06.160\n when you actually start talking about these bigger\n\n3:55:06.160 --> 3:55:07.240\n and bigger things.\n\n3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:08.480\n The other challenge was that we had\n\n3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:10.600\n to decentralize development of the protocol\n\n3:55:10.600 --> 3:55:12.900\n and the brain of the protocol.\n\n3:55:12.900 --> 3:55:15.360\n We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol.\n\n3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:17.080\n The peer review academic process means\n\n3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:19.400\n that there's now an academic incentive\n\n3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:22.240\n for graduate students, postdocs, and professors\n\n3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:24.640\n to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers\n\n3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:26.880\n in our ecosystem because they want tenure.\n\n3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:30.120\n And we showed that you can get it.\n\n3:55:30.120 --> 3:55:32.080\n There's been a lot of people who've gotten\n\n3:55:32.080 --> 3:55:34.320\n great academic careers from working with us.\n\n3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:37.720\n So yeah, keep adding to that pile of 105 papers.\n\n3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:38.880\n This is great.\n\n3:55:38.880 --> 3:55:40.480\n And that doesn't need Charles Hoskinson.\n\n3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:43.120\n It doesn't need IOHK funding or anything like that thereon.\n\n3:55:43.120 --> 3:55:45.080\n We're already seeing unfunded derivative work\n\n3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:46.640\n from people who are completely disconnected\n\n3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:49.600\n from us writing papers about stuff in our ecosystem.\n\n3:55:49.600 --> 3:55:53.040\n So just continue to develop that, but that's looking good.\n\n3:55:53.040 --> 3:55:55.160\n Decentralized development, we're working on that as well.\n\n3:55:55.160 --> 3:55:57.160\n Our goal is sometime in the next few years\n\n3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:00.080\n to make sure there's at least three independent clients,\n\n3:56:00.080 --> 3:56:03.120\n so three completely independent dev teams and code bases,\n\n3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:06.880\n and also to get a separation of the commercial clients\n\n3:56:06.880 --> 3:56:09.360\n from the reference code and turn the reference code\n\n3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:12.200\n into like a formal specification, a formal blueprint,\n\n3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:14.120\n and then have that change management\n\n3:56:14.120 --> 3:56:15.680\n be completely decentralized.\n\n3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:17.880\n The core developers are actually voted on,\n\n3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:21.120\n and the SIP process is used to change that,\n\n3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:24.000\n and then some way of proving that your client\n\n3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:27.340\n follows the specification as a use of the protocol.\n\n3:56:28.200 --> 3:56:30.860\n Is there, beyond the Cardano ecosystem,\n\n3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:35.380\n these ideas of distributed governance,\n\n3:56:35.380 --> 3:56:40.380\n do you see ways it could revolutionize politics?\n\n3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:41.560\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:42.400\n Governments.\n\n3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:45.360\n Oh yeah, like the Ethiopia deal, for example.\n\n3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:47.240\n We have five million people that we brought in\n\n3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:49.280\n with the did system there.\n\n3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:51.160\n That's gonna follow them throughout their whole life.\n\n3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:52.940\n Right now they're high school students,\n\n3:56:52.940 --> 3:56:54.360\n but when they're in their 20s, 30s,\n\n3:56:54.360 --> 3:56:55.880\n they're gonna wanna use that for eVoting\n\n3:56:55.880 --> 3:56:57.600\n and for payments and so forth.\n\n3:56:57.600 --> 3:56:59.120\n Can you describe the Ethiopia project,\n\n3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:00.480\n because that's fascinating.\n\n3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:02.600\n Yeah, so we spent four years in Ethiopia.\n\n3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:05.380\n I went there in 2017 and shook a lot of hands,\n\n3:57:05.380 --> 3:57:06.680\n kissed a lot of babies, and they said,\n\n3:57:06.680 --> 3:57:08.600\n oh yeah, we'll have it all done in six months.\n\n3:57:08.600 --> 3:57:11.620\n Everything is a lot of fun there,\n\n3:57:11.620 --> 3:57:13.800\n but it takes a little bit longer than you'd think\n\n3:57:13.800 --> 3:57:15.760\n to get anything done, and that's okay.\n\n3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:19.080\n I really love Ethiopia, it's a beautiful country.\n\n3:57:19.080 --> 3:57:20.700\n So we spent four years,\n\n3:57:20.700 --> 3:57:22.580\n we trained a whole cohort of developers,\n\n3:57:22.580 --> 3:57:23.760\n and then we started a relationship\n\n3:57:23.760 --> 3:57:25.120\n with the Ministry of Education,\n\n3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:28.300\n and they care a lot about proper credentials.\n\n3:57:28.300 --> 3:57:30.200\n One of the biggest problems they have is,\n\n3:57:30.200 --> 3:57:32.280\n when someone graduates, it's really hard for them\n\n3:57:32.280 --> 3:57:34.600\n to prove the quality of the credentials that they have,\n\n3:57:34.600 --> 3:57:35.640\n and it's really hard for them\n\n3:57:35.640 --> 3:57:37.180\n to prove the knowledge that they have.\n\n3:57:37.180 --> 3:57:39.240\n So if you wanna be an ICT outsourcer,\n\n3:57:39.240 --> 3:57:41.840\n how does somebody know that this is a real program,\n\n3:57:41.840 --> 3:57:44.200\n or how does somebody really know that this is a real doctor,\n\n3:57:44.200 --> 3:57:46.240\n or whatever the hell you're outsourcing?\n\n3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:47.680\n So they said, can you come and build\n\n3:57:47.680 --> 3:57:50.640\n a digital identity system for credentials?\n\n3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:52.920\n So every student in the country at some point\n\n3:57:52.920 --> 3:57:55.240\n will get a DID, a decentralized identifier,\n\n3:57:55.240 --> 3:57:58.160\n and then you can prove all sorts of things about them,\n\n3:57:58.160 --> 3:58:00.960\n like GPA, or what particular diploma they hold,\n\n3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:03.500\n or blah, blah, blah, and then the beautiful thing is,\n\n3:58:03.500 --> 3:58:06.080\n the way we designed it is it's extensible\n\n3:58:06.080 --> 3:58:09.480\n to include payments, extensible to include proofs\n\n3:58:09.480 --> 3:58:11.640\n about themselves, like are you over the age of 21,\n\n3:58:11.640 --> 3:58:14.120\n that kind of stuff, and then eventually it can be used\n\n3:58:14.120 --> 3:58:16.120\n to link into a cryptocurrency system.\n\n3:58:16.120 --> 3:58:18.140\n In this case, we built it for Cardano.\n\n3:58:18.140 --> 3:58:20.840\n So Atala Prism is the framework we're using for it.\n\n3:58:20.840 --> 3:58:23.080\n Every student will get one, and then those students\n\n3:58:23.080 --> 3:58:25.420\n will be able to use those credentials\n\n3:58:25.420 --> 3:58:28.060\n in the Cardano ecosystem, eventually for DeFi,\n\n3:58:28.060 --> 3:58:29.200\n like lending and so forth.\n\n3:58:29.200 --> 3:58:31.280\n So it's the largest blockchain deal of its kind,\n\n3:58:31.280 --> 3:58:33.960\n and it probably will grow to 20 million people\n\n3:58:33.960 --> 3:58:35.500\n over the next 24 months.\n\n3:58:35.500 --> 3:58:37.080\n The other beautiful thing about Ethiopia\n\n3:58:37.080 --> 3:58:38.880\n that people don't know is the prime minister\n\n3:58:38.880 --> 3:58:42.280\n is a cryptographer, and he's in his like 40s, 50s,\n\n3:58:42.280 --> 3:58:44.360\n a young guy, and he can actually read the papers\n\n3:58:44.360 --> 3:58:46.880\n we write, and so he's a really bright guy,\n\n3:58:46.880 --> 3:58:48.960\n and he's written this beautiful agenda\n\n3:58:48.960 --> 3:58:52.960\n called Digital Ethiopia 2025, and one of his things\n\n3:58:52.960 --> 3:58:55.720\n in the agenda is digital identity.\n\n3:58:55.720 --> 3:58:57.240\n He wants every person in the country\n\n3:58:57.240 --> 3:59:00.000\n to have a digital identity by 2025,\n\n3:59:00.000 --> 3:59:01.900\n and he wants to implement an eVoting system\n\n3:59:01.900 --> 3:59:03.400\n at some point for that.\n\n3:59:03.400 --> 3:59:04.880\n So when you ask about governance,\n\n3:59:04.880 --> 3:59:07.200\n all these governance tools that we're constructing\n\n3:59:07.200 --> 3:59:11.400\n for Cardano are completely reusable for a nation state.\n\n3:59:11.400 --> 3:59:13.080\n A company, and by the way, if you create\n\n3:59:13.080 --> 3:59:16.280\n a Cardano application, will eventually be reusable for you,\n\n3:59:16.280 --> 3:59:17.740\n because if you have a DeFi protocol,\n\n3:59:17.740 --> 3:59:19.120\n you need a voting system, why the fuck\n\n3:59:19.120 --> 3:59:20.280\n do you have to reimplement that?\n\n3:59:20.280 --> 3:59:23.000\n Native multiasset, anything that works on ADA\n\n3:59:23.000 --> 3:59:24.640\n works with a native multiasset.\n\n3:59:24.640 --> 3:59:27.080\n You can use our voting system for your asset.\n\n3:59:27.080 --> 3:59:28.660\n So you get a government in a box\n\n3:59:28.660 --> 3:59:31.160\n that you can parameterize any way you want,\n\n3:59:31.160 --> 3:59:33.140\n and similarly, when a government does something\n\n3:59:33.140 --> 3:59:34.980\n with Cardano, not only do they get\n\n3:59:34.980 --> 3:59:38.240\n all this amazing infrastructure, but wait, there's more.\n\n3:59:38.240 --> 3:59:40.240\n They actually get this amazing voting system\n\n3:59:40.240 --> 3:59:43.120\n that they can use for smaller, large scale decisions\n\n3:59:43.120 --> 3:59:44.200\n that they wanna do.\n\n3:59:44.200 --> 3:59:46.360\n On the US side, we're thinking about trying\n\n3:59:46.360 --> 3:59:49.120\n to roll something like this out in the state of Wyoming.\n\n3:59:49.120 --> 3:59:50.960\n There's been tons of laws that are passed.\n\n3:59:50.960 --> 3:59:52.980\n It's a very friendly crypto place.\n\n3:59:52.980 --> 3:59:54.800\n At the very least, it'd be fun to see\n\n3:59:54.800 --> 3:59:57.160\n if we can do the Republican, Democrat primaries\n\n3:59:57.160 --> 4:00:00.400\n with preference voting and voter registration this way,\n\n4:00:00.400 --> 4:00:03.900\n and do it completely online with an eVoting system.\n\n4:00:03.900 --> 4:00:06.560\n So that's something we'll be pursuing in 2022.\n\n4:00:06.560 --> 4:00:08.080\n You think there's some openness to that?\n\n4:00:08.080 --> 4:00:09.440\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n4:00:09.440 --> 4:00:11.440\n That's the one good thing about the craziness of Trump\n\n4:00:11.440 --> 4:00:13.560\n is you made half of America think the election system\n\n4:00:13.560 --> 4:00:15.680\n is completely, irreparably broken.\n\n4:00:15.680 --> 4:00:18.320\n So you walk in, it's like, we're gonna go kill Dominion,\n\n4:00:18.320 --> 4:00:20.920\n and they're like, yay, that's great, let's go do that.\n\n4:00:20.920 --> 4:00:23.040\n Whether you believe that or not,\n\n4:00:23.040 --> 4:00:24.480\n it's created a market opportunity,\n\n4:00:24.480 --> 4:00:26.960\n created a lack of faith and credibility in the system.\n\n4:00:26.960 --> 4:00:28.640\n To improve the system.\n\n4:00:28.640 --> 4:00:30.200\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n4:00:30.200 --> 4:00:32.240\n What do you think about El Salvador\n\n4:00:32.240 --> 4:00:35.840\n becoming the first country to approve a cryptocurrency,\n\n4:00:35.840 --> 4:00:39.080\n Bitcoin in this case, as a legal currency?\n\n4:00:39.080 --> 4:00:40.640\n And where's this trend going?\n\n4:00:40.640 --> 4:00:42.480\n First of all, this event,\n\n4:00:42.480 --> 4:00:44.160\n if you mentioned the Bitcoin conference,\n\n4:00:44.160 --> 4:00:47.520\n the Bitcoin folks believe that this is a monumental event.\n\n4:00:47.520 --> 4:00:49.840\n Do you think this is a start of something new?\n\n4:00:49.840 --> 4:00:53.400\n Well, they're both right, the critics and the pro people.\n\n4:00:53.400 --> 4:00:55.520\n So the critics are saying this is a nothing burger,\n\n4:00:55.520 --> 4:00:58.200\n and it's just a publicity event for El Salvador.\n\n4:00:58.200 --> 4:01:00.720\n And then the people say this is the most monumental event.\n\n4:01:00.720 --> 4:01:02.520\n They may actually be right, because there's\n\n4:01:02.520 --> 4:01:04.240\n reciprocal agreements.\n\n4:01:04.240 --> 4:01:06.040\n When a country issues a currency,\n\n4:01:06.040 --> 4:01:08.200\n other countries honor that, usually,\n\n4:01:08.200 --> 4:01:09.800\n and it trades on forex exchanges.\n\n4:01:09.800 --> 4:01:14.080\n So if Bitcoin becomes a recognized currency of a country,\n\n4:01:14.080 --> 4:01:16.560\n then it may be the case that the United States\n\n4:01:16.560 --> 4:01:18.760\n and European Union and others can't actually stop them\n\n4:01:18.760 --> 4:01:20.520\n from trading on forex exchanges\n\n4:01:20.520 --> 4:01:22.240\n and being treated as a currency\n\n4:01:22.240 --> 4:01:23.600\n from a regulatory perspective.\n\n4:01:23.600 --> 4:01:26.160\n So it was like a really clever backdoor\n\n4:01:26.160 --> 4:01:28.960\n into the League of Nations.\n\n4:01:28.960 --> 4:01:31.960\n And actually, we had this crazy harebrained idea years ago.\n\n4:01:31.960 --> 4:01:34.520\n We were down in Mexico at the Satoshi Roundtable,\n\n4:01:34.520 --> 4:01:36.680\n and we're like, hey, let's go buy a country.\n\n4:01:36.680 --> 4:01:39.200\n Let's go to Tuvalu and get them to do something\n\n4:01:39.200 --> 4:01:40.560\n with the cryptocurrency,\n\n4:01:40.560 --> 4:01:42.120\n because they sell everything in Tuvalu,\n\n4:01:42.120 --> 4:01:44.800\n like the.tv extension and their fishing rights,\n\n4:01:44.800 --> 4:01:48.160\n and Taiwan pays them money to recognize them and so forth.\n\n4:01:48.160 --> 4:01:50.160\n So I'm like, man, maybe we can convince Tuvalu\n\n4:01:50.160 --> 4:01:51.760\n to do something with crypto.\n\n4:01:51.760 --> 4:01:53.520\n And that didn't work out so well.\n\n4:01:53.520 --> 4:01:56.520\n But now El Salvador is actually playing the game,\n\n4:01:56.520 --> 4:01:57.560\n and that's a real country.\n\n4:01:57.560 --> 4:02:00.120\n It's got like 5 million people and so forth.\n\n4:02:00.120 --> 4:02:02.000\n So we know the president's brother,\n\n4:02:02.000 --> 4:02:03.800\n and we've had some conversations there.\n\n4:02:03.800 --> 4:02:05.640\n So maybe we'll go in the next few months\n\n4:02:05.640 --> 4:02:06.880\n and see what's going on there,\n\n4:02:06.880 --> 4:02:09.200\n and do a state visit and talk to the president.\n\n4:02:09.200 --> 4:02:11.560\n But it's an interesting development.\n\n4:02:11.560 --> 4:02:14.280\n And it's one of those things that it can't quite be ignored\n\n4:02:14.280 --> 4:02:15.920\n because the nation state's doing it.\n\n4:02:15.920 --> 4:02:18.480\n On the other hand, you have to manage expectations.\n\n4:02:18.480 --> 4:02:21.080\n Is the central bank taking a position in Bitcoin?\n\n4:02:22.320 --> 4:02:24.840\n Are they actually switching over to a cryptocurrency\n\n4:02:24.840 --> 4:02:26.640\n as their unit of account?\n\n4:02:26.640 --> 4:02:28.320\n Are they now getting off of BIS\n\n4:02:28.320 --> 4:02:31.680\n and they're all using the settlement rails of central banks?\n\n4:02:31.680 --> 4:02:34.120\n Are they actually block chaining the entire country\n\n4:02:34.120 --> 4:02:36.800\n and they have some broad, ambitious agenda\n\n4:02:36.800 --> 4:02:37.840\n to go and do all that?\n\n4:02:37.840 --> 4:02:38.880\n That remains to be seen.\n\n4:02:38.880 --> 4:02:40.640\n And so it really is a commitment there.\n\n4:02:40.640 --> 4:02:43.520\n The other thing is that if you're autocratic,\n\n4:02:43.520 --> 4:02:45.280\n these systems are not so good for you.\n\n4:02:45.280 --> 4:02:47.200\n Because the minute you adopt these types of systems,\n\n4:02:47.200 --> 4:02:49.600\n you're pushing a lot of power to the edges.\n\n4:02:49.600 --> 4:02:51.840\n So there's a world of difference between optics\n\n4:02:51.840 --> 4:02:53.400\n and actual commitment.\n\n4:02:53.400 --> 4:02:55.720\n And actual commitment is I'm prepared\n\n4:02:55.720 --> 4:02:58.000\n to accept the consequences that the state\n\n4:02:58.000 --> 4:03:00.960\n is going to lose a lot of power along the way.\n\n4:03:00.960 --> 4:03:03.240\n And the problem is it's not clear to me\n\n4:03:03.240 --> 4:03:05.560\n some of these politicians who are pro blockchain,\n\n4:03:05.560 --> 4:03:08.160\n and I'm not making a statement on El Salvador in particular,\n\n4:03:08.160 --> 4:03:11.680\n I'm just saying in general, are fully aware of that reality.\n\n4:03:11.680 --> 4:03:13.400\n A lot of them seem to think that somehow\n\n4:03:13.400 --> 4:03:16.120\n they can contain their blockchain genie in the bottle\n\n4:03:16.120 --> 4:03:17.640\n and blockchain their whole country,\n\n4:03:17.640 --> 4:03:19.800\n but stay president for life.\n\n4:03:19.800 --> 4:03:20.800\n That doesn't work.\n\n4:03:21.720 --> 4:03:23.640\n Once they have that power, they're gone.\n\n4:03:23.640 --> 4:03:26.840\n So do you think once they realize that this is one\n\n4:03:26.840 --> 4:03:28.360\n of the failure cases, one of the things\n\n4:03:28.360 --> 4:03:29.360\n that people are concerned about\n\n4:03:29.360 --> 4:03:31.240\n is governments banning cryptocurrency?\n\n4:03:31.240 --> 4:03:32.520\n Well, that's China case, right?\n\n4:03:32.520 --> 4:03:35.400\n They started realizing this was a legitimate threat\n\n4:03:35.400 --> 4:03:37.880\n to capital controls and to the autocratic system\n\n4:03:37.880 --> 4:03:38.960\n that they've constructed there.\n\n4:03:38.960 --> 4:03:41.200\n And then suddenly China started to build its own\n\n4:03:41.200 --> 4:03:43.200\n People's Bank of China blockchain,\n\n4:03:43.200 --> 4:03:46.040\n and Bitcoin is now the redheaded stepchild.\n\n4:03:46.040 --> 4:03:47.040\n They didn't really care too much\n\n4:03:47.040 --> 4:03:48.120\n because it was great for corruption.\n\n4:03:48.120 --> 4:03:49.520\n You could evade capital controls,\n\n4:03:49.520 --> 4:03:51.640\n and so all the well connected people,\n\n4:03:51.640 --> 4:03:53.040\n they're, oh yeah, Bitcoin's bad,\n\n4:03:53.040 --> 4:03:54.640\n but then they'd have Bitcoin of their own,\n\n4:03:54.640 --> 4:03:56.840\n and they could use it to send money around.\n\n4:03:56.840 --> 4:03:59.280\n But now the government has gotten very serious about it.\n\n4:03:59.280 --> 4:04:01.440\n They're saying like, okay, we wanna control\n\n4:04:01.440 --> 4:04:02.840\n and dominate this whole thing,\n\n4:04:02.840 --> 4:04:05.080\n and it's a threat to our plan for the digital yuan\n\n4:04:05.080 --> 4:04:07.240\n to become the world standard to displace the dollar.\n\n4:04:07.240 --> 4:04:09.160\n But so the moment you have El Salvador\n\n4:04:09.160 --> 4:04:10.640\n and just more and more countries,\n\n4:04:10.640 --> 4:04:13.360\n say there'll be a country in Europe, for example,\n\n4:04:13.360 --> 4:04:18.360\n that accepts Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Cardano,\n\n4:04:18.800 --> 4:04:21.080\n the idea is it would put a lot of pressure on you.\n\n4:04:21.080 --> 4:04:23.280\n So there'll be like this kind of ripple effect\n\n4:04:23.280 --> 4:04:26.160\n that you, and then the individual governments\n\n4:04:26.160 --> 4:04:27.000\n won't be able to help,\n\n4:04:27.000 --> 4:04:29.520\n and eventually there'll be a superpower like,\n\n4:04:29.520 --> 4:04:32.000\n I don't know, Russia or the United States,\n\n4:04:32.000 --> 4:04:34.520\n and or, I don't know, Canada.\n\n4:04:34.520 --> 4:04:38.440\n So do you see that sort of an inevitable trend\n\n4:04:38.440 --> 4:04:40.320\n where cryptocurrency takes over the world\n\n4:04:40.320 --> 4:04:45.320\n as a store of value and as a method of payments?\n\n4:04:46.040 --> 4:04:46.880\n Yeah, probably.\n\n4:04:46.880 --> 4:04:48.840\n I mean, you can do just so much more\n\n4:04:48.840 --> 4:04:49.960\n with programmable finance.\n\n4:04:49.960 --> 4:04:51.920\n You know, transactions in general have five properties.\n\n4:04:51.920 --> 4:04:54.320\n You know, you have the asset that runs on the rail.\n\n4:04:54.320 --> 4:04:55.760\n That's what we always think about.\n\n4:04:55.760 --> 4:04:58.000\n And you can transact that, you know,\n\n4:04:58.000 --> 4:04:59.560\n and then you have the identity,\n\n4:04:59.560 --> 4:05:02.040\n and you transact that either like one to one,\n\n4:05:02.040 --> 4:05:04.480\n one to many, many to one, or many to many.\n\n4:05:04.480 --> 4:05:05.400\n And then you have metadata.\n\n4:05:05.400 --> 4:05:07.200\n So that's the story of the transactions,\n\n4:05:07.200 --> 4:05:09.600\n like where did it take place, these types of things.\n\n4:05:09.600 --> 4:05:12.280\n And then you have the contractual relationship.\n\n4:05:12.280 --> 4:05:13.640\n So that's the smart contract component.\n\n4:05:13.640 --> 4:05:15.280\n And then you embed that within regulation.\n\n4:05:15.280 --> 4:05:18.280\n So transactions always live within jurisdictions.\n\n4:05:18.280 --> 4:05:19.760\n This is relevant to the conversation\n\n4:05:19.760 --> 4:05:21.440\n that digital currencies take over\n\n4:05:22.440 --> 4:05:25.800\n because those things are right now done separately\n\n4:05:25.800 --> 4:05:27.960\n in a very fragmented and fractured way,\n\n4:05:27.960 --> 4:05:30.000\n and they're not completely globalized.\n\n4:05:30.000 --> 4:05:33.080\n And so super expensive to hoist up this entire system\n\n4:05:33.080 --> 4:05:35.280\n and automate things like compliance.\n\n4:05:35.280 --> 4:05:39.400\n It's usually a huge part of every bank's balance sheet.\n\n4:05:39.400 --> 4:05:42.320\n So when you look at the concept of a digital currency,\n\n4:05:42.320 --> 4:05:45.000\n you're saying all five of those things are programmable.\n\n4:05:45.000 --> 4:05:47.280\n And so they could be like library driven.\n\n4:05:47.280 --> 4:05:48.560\n You say, oh, I wanna be in compliance\n\n4:05:48.560 --> 4:05:51.920\n with the Eritrea, okay, pull up the Eritrean library.\n\n4:05:51.920 --> 4:05:54.520\n Now you are, it's built into the transaction.\n\n4:05:54.520 --> 4:05:56.800\n Previously, it's like, go hire some lawyers\n\n4:05:56.800 --> 4:05:58.760\n and go figure out the entire code\n\n4:05:58.760 --> 4:06:01.280\n and translate some things and rah, rah, rah.\n\n4:06:01.280 --> 4:06:02.800\n It's crazy.\n\n4:06:02.800 --> 4:06:07.520\n So just the orders of magnitude efficiency gains\n\n4:06:07.520 --> 4:06:10.240\n that you get and the increased liquidity you get\n\n4:06:10.240 --> 4:06:13.040\n and the fact that you can now represent all assets\n\n4:06:13.040 --> 4:06:15.720\n with a universal way, that financial stem cell,\n\n4:06:15.720 --> 4:06:18.680\n there's an inevitability to the victory of our industry.\n\n4:06:18.680 --> 4:06:21.300\n The challenge is how do we deal with this\n\n4:06:21.300 --> 4:06:24.040\n with the squabbling of superpowers?\n\n4:06:24.040 --> 4:06:25.800\n China wants to be the new world standard,\n\n4:06:25.800 --> 4:06:27.280\n America wants to preserve that,\n\n4:06:27.280 --> 4:06:29.200\n and the rest of the world is trying to figure out\n\n4:06:29.200 --> 4:06:31.000\n how do we create something that's a bit more fair\n\n4:06:31.000 --> 4:06:32.280\n and balanced?\n\n4:06:32.280 --> 4:06:36.440\n And so crypto comes in and it potentially is both an ally\n\n4:06:36.440 --> 4:06:38.120\n and a competitor to those desires.\n\n4:06:38.120 --> 4:06:40.200\n Because if you do too much crypto,\n\n4:06:40.200 --> 4:06:42.240\n you don't need a nation state anymore.\n\n4:06:42.240 --> 4:06:45.640\n If you do too little crypto, well, it's China or America.\n\n4:06:45.640 --> 4:06:47.880\n So what's that sweet spot?\n\n4:06:47.880 --> 4:06:52.320\n Do you hope that in the process of cryptocurrency\n\n4:06:52.320 --> 4:06:55.440\n pushing power to the edges to the people\n\n4:06:55.440 --> 4:06:57.400\n that we would be able to alleviate\n\n4:06:57.400 --> 4:06:58.920\n some of the suffering in the world\n\n4:06:58.920 --> 4:07:01.920\n caused by centralized power and the abuses of power,\n\n4:07:01.920 --> 4:07:03.320\n corruption, all those kinds of things?\n\n4:07:03.320 --> 4:07:04.160\n 100%.\n\n4:07:04.160 --> 4:07:06.080\n I made a very angry video months ago.\n\n4:07:07.280 --> 4:07:08.800\n I make angry videos.\n\n4:07:08.800 --> 4:07:10.040\n I shouldn't drink, Clex.\n\n4:07:11.440 --> 4:07:12.280\n Maybe you should drink more.\n\n4:07:12.280 --> 4:07:13.160\n Yeah, I know, right?\n\n4:07:13.160 --> 4:07:14.520\n It depends on who you ask.\n\n4:07:14.520 --> 4:07:15.720\n I made a video a little while.\n\n4:07:15.720 --> 4:07:18.000\n I said, our industry is an industry of frustration.\n\n4:07:18.000 --> 4:07:21.120\n It exists because we weren't the industry\n\n4:07:21.120 --> 4:07:23.760\n that charged 85% interest to the poorest people\n\n4:07:23.760 --> 4:07:24.760\n in the world for loans.\n\n4:07:24.760 --> 4:07:27.800\n We weren't the industry that charged 15% to move money\n\n4:07:27.800 --> 4:07:31.200\n for a maid sending money home to mom in Manila.\n\n4:07:32.240 --> 4:07:33.760\n We weren't the industry that laundered\n\n4:07:33.760 --> 4:07:36.040\n hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money\n\n4:07:36.040 --> 4:07:38.880\n and funded arms dealers in Africa and all these things\n\n4:07:38.880 --> 4:07:42.880\n or permitted oil for food to exist and so forth.\n\n4:07:42.880 --> 4:07:44.880\n And the people who did these things aren't in jail.\n\n4:07:44.880 --> 4:07:45.720\n They're rich.\n\n4:07:45.720 --> 4:07:46.560\n They're billionaires.\n\n4:07:46.560 --> 4:07:48.240\n They fly private jets.\n\n4:07:48.240 --> 4:07:51.560\n So our industry is the antidote to these types of things.\n\n4:07:51.560 --> 4:07:54.800\n And we say, guys, we want a system that's fair.\n\n4:07:54.800 --> 4:07:56.280\n That's it.\n\n4:07:56.280 --> 4:07:59.000\n And we want everybody to be treated equally.\n\n4:07:59.000 --> 4:08:01.000\n That doesn't mean everybody's gonna win.\n\n4:08:01.000 --> 4:08:03.160\n It doesn't mean that when you lose,\n\n4:08:03.160 --> 4:08:05.880\n somebody's gonna come on a white horse and bail you out.\n\n4:08:05.880 --> 4:08:08.080\n You're gonna have winners and losers, but it's fair.\n\n4:08:08.080 --> 4:08:09.040\n That's all we want.\n\n4:08:09.040 --> 4:08:10.640\n That's all we've ever wanted.\n\n4:08:10.640 --> 4:08:12.640\n There's no coincidence that Bitcoin was created\n\n4:08:12.640 --> 4:08:16.080\n right around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n4:08:16.080 --> 4:08:17.920\n It's not like these were just unrelated events.\n\n4:08:17.920 --> 4:08:20.200\n They're highly correlated to each other, okay?\n\n4:08:20.200 --> 4:08:23.120\n I'd say perhaps even causal, go figure.\n\n4:08:23.120 --> 4:08:26.080\n And everything we've done as an industry\n\n4:08:26.080 --> 4:08:28.800\n from that moment to today and beyond\n\n4:08:28.800 --> 4:08:32.760\n has been about that endless, relentless desire\n\n4:08:32.760 --> 4:08:35.400\n to make things a little bit less corrupt,\n\n4:08:35.400 --> 4:08:38.920\n a little bit less nepotistic and a bit more open.\n\n4:08:38.920 --> 4:08:42.000\n And it's gotten so insane\n\n4:08:42.000 --> 4:08:44.360\n that they have these things in Wyoming called speedy banks,\n\n4:08:44.360 --> 4:08:45.680\n where you're full reserve banks.\n\n4:08:45.680 --> 4:08:49.760\n They have 100% of their balance sheet is accounted for.\n\n4:08:49.760 --> 4:08:51.120\n They don't lend.\n\n4:08:51.120 --> 4:08:53.040\n And then you have the people in the banking community\n\n4:08:53.040 --> 4:08:55.360\n saying, well, those are a risk to banking.\n\n4:08:55.360 --> 4:08:59.680\n We're scared that these speedy banks are gonna default.\n\n4:08:59.680 --> 4:09:02.240\n It's like, what world are you living in?\n\n4:09:02.240 --> 4:09:03.520\n You have fractional reserves,\n\n4:09:03.520 --> 4:09:06.280\n sometimes like 2% assets on the balance sheet.\n\n4:09:06.280 --> 4:09:07.680\n And then you're worried that the guys\n\n4:09:07.680 --> 4:09:09.600\n who actually have a dollar for every dollar\n\n4:09:09.600 --> 4:09:12.560\n they say they have are the ones that are gonna collapse.\n\n4:09:12.560 --> 4:09:15.080\n It's like the 1984 level doublespeak\n\n4:09:15.080 --> 4:09:17.080\n when you see the system and negative interest rates\n\n4:09:17.080 --> 4:09:17.960\n and all these other things.\n\n4:09:17.960 --> 4:09:20.880\n And so I absolutely believe the direction course\n\n4:09:20.880 --> 4:09:24.240\n of this industry is to make things more honest and fair.\n\n4:09:24.240 --> 4:09:26.480\n And also by its very existence,\n\n4:09:26.480 --> 4:09:30.520\n it exposes double standards, hypocrisy and corruption.\n\n4:09:30.520 --> 4:09:32.200\n Just the fact that it's there,\n\n4:09:32.200 --> 4:09:34.200\n because it's one thing to say that, well,\n\n4:09:34.200 --> 4:09:36.760\n it just can't be because of the nature of global finance.\n\n4:09:36.760 --> 4:09:38.440\n There's no way to do it otherwise.\n\n4:09:38.440 --> 4:09:41.760\n It's another thing to see it there as an example\n\n4:09:41.760 --> 4:09:43.400\n and say, well, that thing is doing it.\n\n4:09:43.400 --> 4:09:45.360\n Why can't you guys be this way?\n\n4:09:45.360 --> 4:09:46.920\n That's why I'm so passionate about Africa\n\n4:09:46.920 --> 4:09:48.800\n because they don't like the systems they have\n\n4:09:48.800 --> 4:09:50.360\n and everybody's really young.\n\n4:09:50.360 --> 4:09:52.560\n And they are gonna throw all the systems out\n\n4:09:52.560 --> 4:09:53.560\n in the next 20 years.\n\n4:09:53.560 --> 4:09:55.480\n And they're gonna replace them with something else.\n\n4:09:55.480 --> 4:09:57.360\n If we get this stuff into Africa,\n\n4:09:57.360 --> 4:09:59.400\n 1.2 billion people will be living\n\n4:09:59.400 --> 4:10:02.280\n in a considerably better system than the rest of the world.\n\n4:10:02.280 --> 4:10:03.880\n And then everybody else will look at that and say,\n\n4:10:03.880 --> 4:10:05.720\n why the hell are those guys so rich?\n\n4:10:05.720 --> 4:10:07.040\n Why are those guys making the money?\n\n4:10:07.040 --> 4:10:08.840\n Why are those guys doing so well?\n\n4:10:08.840 --> 4:10:10.080\n And it's not satisfying to hear,\n\n4:10:10.080 --> 4:10:13.360\n well, Africa is just better.\n\n4:10:13.360 --> 4:10:14.480\n No one's gonna say that.\n\n4:10:14.480 --> 4:10:17.680\n They're gonna say, okay, yeah, it's nepotism and corruption\n\n4:10:17.680 --> 4:10:19.920\n and lack of transparency and these types of things.\n\n4:10:19.920 --> 4:10:22.160\n So I think absolutely it has the potential\n\n4:10:22.160 --> 4:10:23.760\n to improve the human condition,\n\n4:10:23.760 --> 4:10:26.240\n but humans have to get out of the way.\n\n4:10:26.240 --> 4:10:29.040\n Humans have ingrained in themselves selfishness\n\n4:10:29.040 --> 4:10:32.040\n and it is a desire to maximize for themselves\n\n4:10:32.040 --> 4:10:34.520\n and their family and not thinking systems.\n\n4:10:34.520 --> 4:10:38.160\n And so we have to evolve capitalism at the same time.\n\n4:10:38.160 --> 4:10:40.280\n And what I mean by that is right now you're trying\n\n4:10:40.280 --> 4:10:42.560\n to maximize the amount of resources you get today.\n\n4:10:42.560 --> 4:10:44.600\n What we need to do is start thinking about\n\n4:10:44.600 --> 4:10:47.920\n how do we create future versions of ourselves in 2100\n\n4:10:47.920 --> 4:10:50.200\n and create a resource for that time period.\n\n4:10:50.200 --> 4:10:53.120\n And then the name of the game is to maximize that\n\n4:10:53.120 --> 4:10:55.800\n or balance that with what you get in the short term.\n\n4:10:55.800 --> 4:10:57.440\n And then suddenly you're saying to yourself,\n\n4:10:57.440 --> 4:11:00.160\n well, if I'm doing things that are good for me today,\n\n4:11:00.160 --> 4:11:02.720\n but compromising then I make less money.\n\n4:11:02.720 --> 4:11:05.560\n So capitalism as an engine is okay.\n\n4:11:05.560 --> 4:11:07.600\n The problem is it's misparameterized.\n\n4:11:07.600 --> 4:11:10.040\n Right, almost like inject longterm incentives\n\n4:11:10.040 --> 4:11:10.880\n into the capitalist system.\n\n4:11:10.880 --> 4:11:11.720\n Exactly.\n\n4:11:11.720 --> 4:11:13.880\n And cryptocurrency space is the only economic system\n\n4:11:13.880 --> 4:11:15.640\n where that's actually possible.\n\n4:11:15.640 --> 4:11:17.240\n You can create a tokenomic scheme\n\n4:11:17.240 --> 4:11:19.200\n where doing things that are beneficial for people\n\n4:11:19.200 --> 4:11:21.720\n you'll never meet because you're long dead\n\n4:11:21.720 --> 4:11:23.400\n actually makes you money today.\n\n4:11:23.400 --> 4:11:26.480\n You can't do that in a legacy financial system and so forth.\n\n4:11:26.480 --> 4:11:29.400\n So I think that that's the real impact capital conversation\n\n4:11:29.400 --> 4:11:32.080\n that has to be had as you explore these things\n\n4:11:32.080 --> 4:11:34.000\n is you have to talk to people and say,\n\n4:11:34.000 --> 4:11:35.560\n look, it's not about communism\n\n4:11:35.560 --> 4:11:37.560\n or socialism versus capitalism.\n\n4:11:37.560 --> 4:11:40.480\n It's not about, hey, let's donate and save the world\n\n4:11:40.480 --> 4:11:43.120\n or try to be charity and make things better.\n\n4:11:43.120 --> 4:11:44.760\n It's all about how do you use the fact\n\n4:11:44.760 --> 4:11:48.160\n that we have a better toolkit to create a different system,\n\n4:11:48.160 --> 4:11:49.720\n a different incentive model\n\n4:11:49.720 --> 4:11:51.720\n where the default configuration of the system\n\n4:11:51.720 --> 4:11:53.160\n is longterm thinking.\n\n4:11:53.160 --> 4:11:54.720\n And the default consideration of system\n\n4:11:54.720 --> 4:11:56.600\n is get rid of all these negative externalities\n\n4:11:56.600 --> 4:11:59.880\n that marketplaces have and judge the success of society,\n\n4:11:59.880 --> 4:12:02.440\n not by how the greatest of society are doing,\n\n4:12:02.440 --> 4:12:04.880\n but by how the least of society are doing.\n\n4:12:04.880 --> 4:12:07.200\n HDI, not GDP, this kind of thinking.\n\n4:12:07.200 --> 4:12:09.880\n And I think crypto can actually be the vanguard\n\n4:12:09.880 --> 4:12:10.720\n that kind of pushes us there.\n\n4:12:10.720 --> 4:12:12.880\n And the first countries to adopt that\n\n4:12:12.880 --> 4:12:16.040\n are gonna be just significantly better places to live.\n\n4:12:16.040 --> 4:12:17.240\n And the people who envy them\n\n4:12:17.240 --> 4:12:18.560\n will force the other countries to change.\n\n4:12:18.560 --> 4:12:19.400\n That's right.\n\n4:12:19.400 --> 4:12:20.240\n That'd be a ripple effect.\n\n4:12:20.240 --> 4:12:21.600\n So when you wake up in the morning\n\n4:12:21.600 --> 4:12:23.080\n or as you sleep like a baby,\n\n4:12:23.080 --> 4:12:25.440\n wake up multiple times in the middle of the night,\n\n4:12:25.440 --> 4:12:30.440\n do you feel the burden of this kind of future\n\n4:12:31.640 --> 4:12:34.400\n that's in your hands and not to mess it up?\n\n4:12:34.400 --> 4:12:37.000\n Like, what is it, Big Lebowski?\n\n4:12:37.000 --> 4:12:38.640\n Her life is in your hands, dude.\n\n4:12:38.640 --> 4:12:41.680\n Don't worry about them.\n\n4:12:41.680 --> 4:12:43.000\n They're nihilists, Tony.\n\n4:12:43.000 --> 4:12:46.760\n Do you feel the burden of like,\n\n4:12:46.760 --> 4:12:49.480\n because we're talking about all these 100 plus papers\n\n4:12:49.480 --> 4:12:52.200\n and the academic beauty of the algorithms\n\n4:12:52.200 --> 4:12:53.040\n we're talking about,\n\n4:12:53.040 --> 4:12:56.280\n and there's millions of human lives at stake here.\n\n4:12:56.280 --> 4:12:57.880\n I mean, you always feel the burden,\n\n4:12:57.880 --> 4:12:59.040\n especially in my own company.\n\n4:12:59.040 --> 4:13:00.640\n I mean, I have all these people work for me\n\n4:13:00.640 --> 4:13:03.200\n and they eat because I pay them, right?\n\n4:13:03.200 --> 4:13:06.320\n So if I can't pay them, then that's my fault.\n\n4:13:06.320 --> 4:13:09.280\n So you have to, as a leader,\n\n4:13:09.280 --> 4:13:10.560\n you always have to be cognizant\n\n4:13:10.560 --> 4:13:11.480\n that there's all these people\n\n4:13:11.480 --> 4:13:13.520\n who have signed up for your crazy vision\n\n4:13:13.520 --> 4:13:16.000\n and you have to be larger than life.\n\n4:13:16.000 --> 4:13:18.240\n You always have to be good.\n\n4:13:18.240 --> 4:13:20.400\n You're not allowed to have a bad day.\n\n4:13:20.400 --> 4:13:21.760\n You're not allowed to feel like shit.\n\n4:13:21.760 --> 4:13:23.080\n You always have to show up.\n\n4:13:23.080 --> 4:13:24.920\n You always have to be pushing for it.\n\n4:13:26.160 --> 4:13:28.080\n And so that's a huge burden in many respects\n\n4:13:28.080 --> 4:13:29.560\n because there's Charles the person\n\n4:13:29.560 --> 4:13:31.880\n and then Charles the CEO,\n\n4:13:31.880 --> 4:13:33.680\n and these are very different things\n\n4:13:34.720 --> 4:13:37.200\n in terms of expectations, at the very least.\n\n4:13:37.200 --> 4:13:39.880\n And so it's heavy in that respect.\n\n4:13:39.880 --> 4:13:41.480\n That said, what gives you solace\n\n4:13:41.480 --> 4:13:43.560\n is that you're not in it alone.\n\n4:13:43.560 --> 4:13:45.240\n It's lonely, but you're not alone.\n\n4:13:45.240 --> 4:13:47.680\n You have so many amazing people around you\n\n4:13:47.680 --> 4:13:48.720\n that are willing to help\n\n4:13:48.720 --> 4:13:51.080\n and actually take some of that burden.\n\n4:13:51.080 --> 4:13:53.200\n My life has gotten considerably better\n\n4:13:53.200 --> 4:13:55.680\n when I learned how to delegate and trust.\n\n4:13:55.680 --> 4:13:57.960\n And even if people screw up and fail,\n\n4:13:57.960 --> 4:13:59.920\n it's worth the risk\n\n4:13:59.920 --> 4:14:02.360\n because ultimately you're amplifying yourself.\n\n4:14:02.360 --> 4:14:06.120\n The other thing is that it's okay not to get all the way.\n\n4:14:06.120 --> 4:14:07.800\n You want to, you wanna push there,\n\n4:14:07.800 --> 4:14:10.160\n but make sure whatever the hell you do,\n\n4:14:10.160 --> 4:14:12.000\n you leave something for somebody else\n\n4:14:12.000 --> 4:14:13.840\n to pick up and carry on.\n\n4:14:13.840 --> 4:14:16.880\n That's why we care so much about the publication process\n\n4:14:16.880 --> 4:14:17.720\n and open source.\n\n4:14:17.720 --> 4:14:20.480\n We'll never file a patent in our entire history\n\n4:14:20.480 --> 4:14:23.800\n because whatever we do, it's yours as much as it is mine.\n\n4:14:23.800 --> 4:14:26.280\n And maybe I can only get you 70% of the way\n\n4:14:26.280 --> 4:14:28.200\n and I'll plop over dead from a heart attack\n\n4:14:28.200 --> 4:14:30.600\n or get killed by an eagle or something like that.\n\n4:14:30.600 --> 4:14:31.440\n Maybe somebody brings the.\n\n4:14:31.440 --> 4:14:32.440\n Eagle.\n\n4:14:32.440 --> 4:14:35.200\n Maybe somebody brings the hast eagle back and it kills me.\n\n4:14:35.200 --> 4:14:36.280\n So it could happen.\n\n4:14:36.280 --> 4:14:37.600\n They're bringing the woolly mammoth back.\n\n4:14:37.600 --> 4:14:39.880\n Talk to George Church about that.\n\n4:14:39.880 --> 4:14:40.720\n It's a good way to go.\n\n4:14:40.720 --> 4:14:41.560\n Yeah, I know.\n\n4:14:41.560 --> 4:14:42.680\n Even the eagle or the mammoth.\n\n4:14:42.680 --> 4:14:44.080\n I'd rather be crushed by a mammoth\n\n4:14:44.080 --> 4:14:46.520\n because eagles actually fly you up and drop you.\n\n4:14:46.520 --> 4:14:47.360\n It's.\n\n4:14:47.360 --> 4:14:48.720\n Oh, so you won't die via slow death\n\n4:14:48.720 --> 4:14:49.960\n and they probably peck at you.\n\n4:14:49.960 --> 4:14:50.800\n Exactly.\n\n4:14:50.800 --> 4:14:52.720\n You just be grievously wounded on the ground\n\n4:14:52.720 --> 4:14:55.080\n and the eagle is like slowly devouring you.\n\n4:14:55.080 --> 4:14:56.800\n Yeah, don't go down that way.\n\n4:14:56.800 --> 4:14:58.200\n I've lost my train of thought.\n\n4:14:58.200 --> 4:15:03.200\n The point is you feel deeply great\n\n4:15:03.200 --> 4:15:06.280\n with a bunch of people around you and then you give.\n\n4:15:06.280 --> 4:15:07.800\n Yeah, you delegate, you delegate.\n\n4:15:07.800 --> 4:15:09.600\n And somebody fights the eagle\n\n4:15:09.600 --> 4:15:11.160\n and then other people takes care of that\n\n4:15:11.160 --> 4:15:12.000\n and this, that and the other.\n\n4:15:12.000 --> 4:15:13.240\n You just do the best you can.\n\n4:15:13.240 --> 4:15:14.080\n You're in the arena.\n\n4:15:14.080 --> 4:15:15.240\n You fight as hard as you can.\n\n4:15:15.240 --> 4:15:19.120\n You leave nothing for home.\n\n4:15:19.120 --> 4:15:20.720\n You could put it all on the field\n\n4:15:20.720 --> 4:15:21.680\n and then when you go home,\n\n4:15:21.680 --> 4:15:23.160\n you have pride in what you've done\n\n4:15:23.160 --> 4:15:26.000\n and you know that you've at least made a slight difference.\n\n4:15:26.000 --> 4:15:28.280\n You know, one person can make a huge difference.\n\n4:15:28.280 --> 4:15:30.240\n Look at Norman Borlaug.\n\n4:15:30.240 --> 4:15:31.400\n I mean, he just went around the whole world\n\n4:15:31.400 --> 4:15:32.880\n teaching people how to grow crops.\n\n4:15:32.880 --> 4:15:35.560\n He saved a billion lives over the course of his life.\n\n4:15:35.560 --> 4:15:38.720\n Billion people didn't starve to death because of one guy.\n\n4:15:38.720 --> 4:15:40.200\n It's amazing the asymmetry\n\n4:15:40.200 --> 4:15:41.760\n and the returns on that type of a thing\n\n4:15:41.760 --> 4:15:44.080\n just for the knowledge transfer of all things\n\n4:15:44.080 --> 4:15:46.080\n and yet not a household name.\n\n4:15:46.080 --> 4:15:49.200\n So that's the other side of it, of the burdens.\n\n4:15:49.200 --> 4:15:51.560\n People always want something or something.\n\n4:15:51.560 --> 4:15:53.240\n So they say, oh, if I endured all these burdens,\n\n4:15:53.240 --> 4:15:54.720\n I should be given something.\n\n4:15:54.720 --> 4:15:57.120\n I entered into this space fully expecting\n\n4:15:57.120 --> 4:16:00.320\n that probably the most likely outcome was jail.\n\n4:16:00.320 --> 4:16:02.480\n That's what my dad told me and other people told me.\n\n4:16:02.480 --> 4:16:04.880\n And it was because it's like, look at where we came from.\n\n4:16:04.880 --> 4:16:07.040\n The Liberty Dollar, eGold, all these things.\n\n4:16:07.040 --> 4:16:09.560\n Anybody tries to innovate the monetary system,\n\n4:16:09.560 --> 4:16:12.040\n either end up like Gaddafi or they end up in prison\n\n4:16:12.040 --> 4:16:15.120\n or they end up like nepotistic corrupt banker\n\n4:16:15.120 --> 4:16:16.520\n or something like that.\n\n4:16:16.520 --> 4:16:19.760\n And so the financial regulations\n\n4:16:19.760 --> 4:16:22.280\n are not built for rapid innovation.\n\n4:16:22.280 --> 4:16:24.040\n They're not built for Bitcoin.\n\n4:16:24.040 --> 4:16:26.040\n There's a reason Satoshi was anonymous.\n\n4:16:26.040 --> 4:16:28.480\n It wasn't because he enjoyed the anonymity.\n\n4:16:28.480 --> 4:16:30.840\n There was legitimate criminal risk\n\n4:16:30.840 --> 4:16:32.360\n for this type of activity.\n\n4:16:32.360 --> 4:16:34.320\n So the fact that I've gotten this far\n\n4:16:34.320 --> 4:16:37.000\n and I'm doing pretty good, that's a win.\n\n4:16:37.000 --> 4:16:38.960\n You take that, life is good.\n\n4:16:39.960 --> 4:16:41.640\n What does a productive day in the life\n\n4:16:41.640 --> 4:16:43.720\n of Charles Hoskinson look like?\n\n4:16:43.720 --> 4:16:46.000\n Now we're getting to the details here.\n\n4:16:46.000 --> 4:16:49.320\n Diet, like fasting or not maybe,\n\n4:16:49.320 --> 4:16:54.120\n coffee, non coffee, exercise, sleep,\n\n4:16:54.120 --> 4:16:57.600\n scheduling like periods of deep work, programming,\n\n4:16:57.600 --> 4:16:59.840\n then the social media stuff that you do.\n\n4:16:59.840 --> 4:17:01.600\n You clearly enjoy being on social media\n\n4:17:01.600 --> 4:17:04.280\n and also live streaming, educating, inspiring the world\n\n4:17:04.280 --> 4:17:07.880\n or getting drunk and ranting at the computer.\n\n4:17:07.880 --> 4:17:10.240\n Well, first off you do a wet year and a dry year.\n\n4:17:10.240 --> 4:17:12.360\n That's what prevents you from becoming an alcoholic.\n\n4:17:12.360 --> 4:17:14.960\n So unfortunately the way that schedule worked,\n\n4:17:14.960 --> 4:17:17.000\n 2020 was my dry year.\n\n4:17:17.000 --> 4:17:18.760\n Like I didn't drink the entire year.\n\n4:17:18.760 --> 4:17:20.160\n Not a single sip of alcohol.\n\n4:17:20.160 --> 4:17:21.000\n It was the worst.\n\n4:17:21.000 --> 4:17:21.840\n On purpose.\n\n4:17:21.840 --> 4:17:23.560\n Yeah, you do a dry year and then you do a wet year.\n\n4:17:23.560 --> 4:17:26.240\n Oh, so this is one of your ideas about life\n\n4:17:26.240 --> 4:17:27.280\n is you alternate.\n\n4:17:27.280 --> 4:17:28.760\n Yeah, you have to alternate.\n\n4:17:28.760 --> 4:17:30.440\n Never do too much of any one thing.\n\n4:17:30.440 --> 4:17:31.640\n Well, Churchill never alternated.\n\n4:17:31.640 --> 4:17:32.960\n He just kept drinking throughout his life.\n\n4:17:32.960 --> 4:17:33.960\n He did pretty good.\n\n4:17:33.960 --> 4:17:37.760\n Just to push back against the year.\n\n4:17:37.760 --> 4:17:39.400\n Yeah, he had an Alfred North Whitehead.\n\n4:17:39.400 --> 4:17:41.000\n Although didn't Churchill get kicked out\n\n4:17:41.000 --> 4:17:42.240\n as prime minister at some point?\n\n4:17:42.240 --> 4:17:44.280\n So maybe he took one dry year.\n\n4:17:44.280 --> 4:17:47.120\n Yeah, he was a sober, happy, in shape Churchill.\n\n4:17:47.120 --> 4:17:49.320\n He would have led a Britain for 30 fucking years.\n\n4:17:49.320 --> 4:17:54.320\n But you know, see Lex, that's why we can't have nice things.\n\n4:17:55.120 --> 4:17:57.000\n Conor S. Thompson, maybe you're onto something.\n\n4:17:57.000 --> 4:17:58.960\n Oh, you know, it's really crazy if you go to Aspen\n\n4:17:58.960 --> 4:18:00.840\n and see the bar he used to go to.\n\n4:18:00.840 --> 4:18:02.680\n I actually met a waitress who knew him really well\n\n4:18:02.680 --> 4:18:05.360\n and he'd go in there like two, three times a day\n\n4:18:05.360 --> 4:18:07.240\n and she's like, yeah, he'd do cocaine\n\n4:18:07.240 --> 4:18:10.280\n right here on the table and he'd come in with lots of pills\n\n4:18:10.280 --> 4:18:12.320\n and just put them all out on the table\n\n4:18:12.320 --> 4:18:13.880\n and be taking them at different hours\n\n4:18:13.880 --> 4:18:15.760\n and they were all clearly illegal substances\n\n4:18:15.760 --> 4:18:18.320\n but we'd just give him coffee or whatever he wanted.\n\n4:18:18.320 --> 4:18:19.320\n He's a great guy.\n\n4:18:19.320 --> 4:18:20.800\n But anyway, that's the day in the life of Charles.\n\n4:18:20.800 --> 4:18:23.920\n I fast, I tried to do intermittent fasting, 16, eight.\n\n4:18:23.920 --> 4:18:26.200\n The longest fast I ever did for a long term fast\n\n4:18:26.200 --> 4:18:28.120\n was two weeks, which was just crazy.\n\n4:18:28.120 --> 4:18:28.960\n Wow.\n\n4:18:28.960 --> 4:18:30.200\n Oh my God, I was.\n\n4:18:30.200 --> 4:18:33.160\n Can you take me through the journey of like philosophically\n\n4:18:33.160 --> 4:18:34.720\n what was going on in your mind?\n\n4:18:34.720 --> 4:18:37.120\n Well, so normally when I do an extended fast\n\n4:18:37.120 --> 4:18:38.680\n it's about three, four days\n\n4:18:38.680 --> 4:18:40.840\n because that's the sweet spot before you start losing\n\n4:18:40.840 --> 4:18:42.880\n muscle mass and other things start happening\n\n4:18:42.880 --> 4:18:45.800\n and people know so much more about this than I do\n\n4:18:45.800 --> 4:18:47.080\n but I just feel pretty good\n\n4:18:47.080 --> 4:18:49.520\n and you kind of get addicted to the fast high.\n\n4:18:49.520 --> 4:18:52.280\n You don't have to eat, you have no downtime,\n\n4:18:52.280 --> 4:18:54.680\n you're just going, your energy never dips\n\n4:18:54.680 --> 4:18:58.200\n and so I used to do like three, five days,\n\n4:18:58.200 --> 4:19:00.800\n maybe three, four was the sweet spot\n\n4:19:00.800 --> 4:19:02.640\n but then after about a week I was like,\n\n4:19:02.640 --> 4:19:04.560\n how long do I, can I make this go?\n\n4:19:04.560 --> 4:19:05.760\n And so I started talking to some people,\n\n4:19:05.760 --> 4:19:09.840\n I said, well, Angus Barbary did 384 days,\n\n4:19:09.840 --> 4:19:11.240\n of course I'm not as fat as Angus\n\n4:19:11.240 --> 4:19:13.080\n so I said, oh, I can do two weeks.\n\n4:19:13.080 --> 4:19:15.440\n So I just kept going and kept going and kept going\n\n4:19:15.440 --> 4:19:19.280\n and kept going and right around the two week mark\n\n4:19:19.280 --> 4:19:21.640\n I fainted for a little bit in a chair\n\n4:19:21.640 --> 4:19:24.920\n and I was like, okay, maybe I should start eating again\n\n4:19:24.920 --> 4:19:26.160\n but then I was legitimately worried\n\n4:19:26.160 --> 4:19:28.040\n about like refeeding syndrome and this stuff,\n\n4:19:28.040 --> 4:19:30.040\n like, okay, how do I take care of that?\n\n4:19:30.040 --> 4:19:31.640\n So my brother's a doctor and I called him\n\n4:19:31.640 --> 4:19:34.360\n and I said, hey, Willie, I haven't eaten in two weeks,\n\n4:19:34.360 --> 4:19:36.480\n how do I start eating again?\n\n4:19:36.480 --> 4:19:37.880\n And he's like, what?\n\n4:19:39.880 --> 4:19:40.720\n Slowly.\n\n4:19:40.720 --> 4:19:43.800\n Slowly, yeah, so the usual routine intermittent fasting,\n\n4:19:43.800 --> 4:19:46.080\n although I haven't been as good about it as I should be\n\n4:19:46.080 --> 4:19:49.080\n and I used to work out, I don't do as much as that,\n\n4:19:49.080 --> 4:19:52.800\n the stress and the work life balance has been horrible\n\n4:19:52.800 --> 4:19:55.000\n the last 24 months and I've gained a lot of weight\n\n4:19:55.000 --> 4:19:57.080\n and all that stuff but I'll fix that\n\n4:19:57.080 --> 4:19:58.240\n but I do try a lot of things,\n\n4:19:58.240 --> 4:20:00.320\n like I used to call map and I do meditation,\n\n4:20:00.320 --> 4:20:02.760\n recently I started doing photobiomodulation,\n\n4:20:02.760 --> 4:20:03.680\n you ever heard of that?\n\n4:20:03.680 --> 4:20:06.160\n It's a crazy headset called a Vlite,\n\n4:20:06.160 --> 4:20:08.120\n you saw that picture of me with like the weird thing\n\n4:20:08.120 --> 4:20:09.400\n with the red lights on,\n\n4:20:09.400 --> 4:20:10.920\n it actually shoots lights into your brain,\n\n4:20:10.920 --> 4:20:13.240\n it's really cool stuff but it improves blood flow\n\n4:20:13.240 --> 4:20:15.320\n and actually there's some peer reviewed studies\n\n4:20:15.320 --> 4:20:17.240\n that show that it does neurogenesis\n\n4:20:17.240 --> 4:20:19.880\n so you actually generate new neurons and things like that,\n\n4:20:19.880 --> 4:20:21.960\n it's really cool stuff so I do that\n\n4:20:21.960 --> 4:20:24.000\n and it actually helps a lot\n\n4:20:24.000 --> 4:20:26.160\n and every day's a little different.\n\n4:20:27.400 --> 4:20:31.320\n Do you get a few hours of like alone time to work, to think?\n\n4:20:31.320 --> 4:20:34.280\n Yeah, deep work is so important,\n\n4:20:34.280 --> 4:20:36.800\n there's even a book on that, like Deep Work.\n\n4:20:36.800 --> 4:20:38.080\n Yeah, by Cal Newport.\n\n4:20:38.080 --> 4:20:39.200\n I think you interviewed him, didn't you?\n\n4:20:39.200 --> 4:20:41.560\n Yeah, everyone should listen to this podcast,\n\n4:20:41.560 --> 4:20:43.320\n Deep Questions, he's awesome,\n\n4:20:43.320 --> 4:20:46.760\n he's a mathematician, theoretical computer scientist\n\n4:20:46.760 --> 4:20:48.400\n so those guys really need their time\n\n4:20:48.400 --> 4:20:49.560\n and want to really think.\n\n4:20:49.560 --> 4:20:51.320\n That's the one thing I deeply miss,\n\n4:20:51.320 --> 4:20:54.800\n when you're a CEO, you're the master of the five minute deal,\n\n4:20:54.800 --> 4:20:56.360\n you come in, you talk to people,\n\n4:20:56.360 --> 4:20:58.040\n you make a decision, you move on to the next thing,\n\n4:20:58.040 --> 4:20:58.880\n you move on to the next thing\n\n4:20:58.880 --> 4:21:01.240\n and I used to be used to like really deep focus,\n\n4:21:01.240 --> 4:21:02.680\n you'd sit down and think about something\n\n4:21:02.680 --> 4:21:05.760\n for 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours and that's that\n\n4:21:05.760 --> 4:21:08.000\n and I enjoyed it, it was just so beautiful\n\n4:21:08.000 --> 4:21:11.800\n to get lost into something and just go and go and go\n\n4:21:11.800 --> 4:21:13.320\n and then you become a CEO and it's like\n\n4:21:13.320 --> 4:21:14.320\n you never can go and go,\n\n4:21:14.320 --> 4:21:16.360\n you're lucky if you read a four page thing\n\n4:21:16.360 --> 4:21:18.080\n because there's something else that comes up,\n\n4:21:18.080 --> 4:21:19.720\n you have to travel, you have to do that\n\n4:21:19.720 --> 4:21:21.600\n so I've been trying lately to have\n\n4:21:21.600 --> 4:21:23.800\n and actually our chief of staff recommended\n\n4:21:23.800 --> 4:21:26.200\n like Fridays is do not disturb day\n\n4:21:26.200 --> 4:21:28.840\n so it's for deep work, you don't have meetings,\n\n4:21:28.840 --> 4:21:29.680\n none of these things\n\n4:21:29.680 --> 4:21:32.040\n and so far I have not committed to that\n\n4:21:32.040 --> 4:21:33.320\n but everybody else in the organization\n\n4:21:33.320 --> 4:21:34.200\n has started to move there\n\n4:21:34.200 --> 4:21:35.640\n but my hope is next month\n\n4:21:35.640 --> 4:21:37.580\n that I can actually get serious about that.\n\n4:21:37.580 --> 4:21:39.000\n The other time I'm lost in thought\n\n4:21:39.000 --> 4:21:40.740\n is I do a lot of float tanks,\n\n4:21:40.740 --> 4:21:42.360\n have you ever done isolation tanks?\n\n4:21:42.360 --> 4:21:43.800\n But I really want to.\n\n4:21:43.800 --> 4:21:46.280\n It's one of the most amazing things you can do,\n\n4:21:46.280 --> 4:21:48.000\n you come out on the other side\n\n4:21:48.000 --> 4:21:51.240\n and all your stress worries, they're just gone\n\n4:21:51.240 --> 4:21:53.880\n and you have so much productivity and clarity,\n\n4:21:53.880 --> 4:21:57.160\n if you combine that with daily naps, that's the way to go.\n\n4:21:57.160 --> 4:21:58.560\n Yeah, I'm a huge fan of naps\n\n4:21:58.560 --> 4:22:01.520\n so what about the social media stuff\n\n4:22:01.520 --> 4:22:04.540\n and like you doing the live streams,\n\n4:22:04.540 --> 4:22:06.680\n do you ever dread those?\n\n4:22:06.680 --> 4:22:08.960\n Are you energized by those?\n\n4:22:08.960 --> 4:22:10.280\n Because you're exceptionally good\n\n4:22:10.280 --> 4:22:12.240\n at communicating all the different kinds of ideas\n\n4:22:12.240 --> 4:22:14.000\n and being very transparent with the community,\n\n4:22:14.000 --> 4:22:14.820\n all those kinds of things.\n\n4:22:14.820 --> 4:22:16.840\n I really enjoy the live streams,\n\n4:22:16.840 --> 4:22:18.920\n it's fun, it's never been a chore\n\n4:22:18.920 --> 4:22:20.520\n because it's for them,\n\n4:22:20.520 --> 4:22:22.240\n it's a chance for people in the community\n\n4:22:22.240 --> 4:22:23.600\n who've been loyal and they really love it\n\n4:22:23.600 --> 4:22:25.560\n to actually just be there, ask some questions\n\n4:22:25.560 --> 4:22:28.320\n and I try to make it as entertaining as possible\n\n4:22:28.320 --> 4:22:32.160\n and you have your trolls and you have your love\n\n4:22:32.160 --> 4:22:34.680\n and it's actually nice to have a mixture of the two\n\n4:22:34.680 --> 4:22:37.200\n because sometimes you can beat down trolls just for fun,\n\n4:22:37.200 --> 4:22:40.460\n that kind of stuff and it's grown to a cult following,\n\n4:22:40.460 --> 4:22:42.480\n I think there's like 40, 50,000 people\n\n4:22:42.480 --> 4:22:45.360\n and it's almost like Fight Club in a certain respect.\n\n4:22:45.360 --> 4:22:47.400\n So I was in Vancouver years ago\n\n4:22:47.400 --> 4:22:49.320\n and I was in Air Canada checking in,\n\n4:22:49.320 --> 4:22:50.920\n just about to fly back to Colorado\n\n4:22:50.920 --> 4:22:52.520\n and I was getting this weird vibe\n\n4:22:52.520 --> 4:22:53.920\n from the guy that was checking me in\n\n4:22:53.920 --> 4:22:55.960\n and then right after he takes my bag,\n\n4:22:55.960 --> 4:22:57.320\n he kind of leans over to me, he's like,\n\n4:22:57.320 --> 4:23:00.280\n I love Ada and I was like, really?\n\n4:23:00.280 --> 4:23:02.480\n He's like, yeah, I watch your live streams\n\n4:23:02.480 --> 4:23:04.000\n and then I was flying into London,\n\n4:23:04.000 --> 4:23:05.440\n I was in London Heathrow Airport\n\n4:23:05.440 --> 4:23:07.280\n and the passport control guy was there\n\n4:23:07.280 --> 4:23:09.080\n and I was just about to take my passport out\n\n4:23:09.080 --> 4:23:11.400\n and he says, welcome to London, Mr. Hoskinson.\n\n4:23:11.400 --> 4:23:15.440\n I was like, oh God, am I going to jail in London?\n\n4:23:15.440 --> 4:23:17.520\n Why does the border patrol guy know who I am?\n\n4:23:17.520 --> 4:23:19.400\n This is a bad deal for me\n\n4:23:19.400 --> 4:23:22.020\n and it turned out he watched my live streams\n\n4:23:22.020 --> 4:23:25.760\n and so there's a lot of that and that's so much fun.\n\n4:23:25.760 --> 4:23:28.240\n In fact, here in Austin, I was at a Mexican restaurant\n\n4:23:28.240 --> 4:23:31.120\n just down in the closest place\n\n4:23:31.120 --> 4:23:33.920\n and while eating there, two different people recognized me\n\n4:23:33.920 --> 4:23:35.400\n and I took a picture with one of them\n\n4:23:35.400 --> 4:23:37.240\n and again, they watched the live streams.\n\n4:23:37.240 --> 4:23:38.080\n So that's.\n\n4:23:38.080 --> 4:23:39.260\n Well, if it's anything like Fight Club,\n\n4:23:39.260 --> 4:23:40.920\n you have to wonder if some of those people\n\n4:23:40.920 --> 4:23:43.500\n or all of them are just figments of your imagination.\n\n4:23:43.500 --> 4:23:44.740\n Right, I would.\n\n4:23:46.160 --> 4:23:47.760\n I don't have an answer for that.\n\n4:23:49.480 --> 4:23:51.160\n I could be a figment of your imagination\n\n4:23:51.160 --> 4:23:52.000\n which just proves that yes.\n\n4:23:52.000 --> 4:23:52.840\n Yeah, but honestly,\n\n4:23:52.840 --> 4:23:54.640\n if I was capable of that level of delusion,\n\n4:23:54.640 --> 4:23:56.400\n why the hell don't I look like Brad Pitt?\n\n4:23:56.400 --> 4:23:57.240\n Good point.\n\n4:23:57.240 --> 4:24:01.120\n Okay, so on this topic, let me ask you about mushrooms.\n\n4:24:02.400 --> 4:24:05.580\n You're interested in mushrooms, growing mushrooms.\n\n4:24:05.580 --> 4:24:08.240\n I believe you are also interested\n\n4:24:08.240 --> 4:24:11.320\n in the mind expanding capabilities of psychedelics.\n\n4:24:11.320 --> 4:24:14.240\n At least you mentioned kind of the interesting place\n\n4:24:14.240 --> 4:24:17.520\n where your interest in non psychedelic mushrooms might go.\n\n4:24:17.520 --> 4:24:21.120\n Can you explain the nature of your interest in mushrooms?\n\n4:24:21.120 --> 4:24:24.120\n Is it personal, is it business, is it both?\n\n4:24:24.120 --> 4:24:25.480\n No, it's a little bit of everything.\n\n4:24:25.480 --> 4:24:28.000\n You know, it's just an underexplored area\n\n4:24:28.000 --> 4:24:31.200\n of science and botany that ought to be explored\n\n4:24:31.200 --> 4:24:34.600\n because there's so much cool, interesting stuff there.\n\n4:24:34.600 --> 4:24:37.320\n Mushrooms do so much.\n\n4:24:37.320 --> 4:24:39.380\n Like they have these things called cordyceps\n\n4:24:39.380 --> 4:24:43.720\n and they are like a zombie fungus that infects insects,\n\n4:24:43.720 --> 4:24:46.360\n takes them over and then it will have them\n\n4:24:46.360 --> 4:24:47.720\n kind of get to other insects\n\n4:24:47.720 --> 4:24:50.160\n and then burst out of their head like an alien\n\n4:24:50.160 --> 4:24:52.240\n and spray spores on them and repeat the process.\n\n4:24:52.240 --> 4:24:53.920\n I mean, they even made a damn game about this.\n\n4:24:53.920 --> 4:24:55.840\n The Last of Us or something like that.\n\n4:24:55.840 --> 4:24:56.880\n And this is a real thing.\n\n4:24:56.880 --> 4:24:59.020\n Like you can Google it and see like these dead ants\n\n4:24:59.020 --> 4:25:01.440\n with these fungal stabs coming out of them.\n\n4:25:01.440 --> 4:25:03.840\n It's like, holy God, this is crazy.\n\n4:25:03.840 --> 4:25:08.840\n And in the same topic, you go all the way to Lion's Mane\n\n4:25:09.720 --> 4:25:11.760\n and it could actually help treat Alzheimer's\n\n4:25:11.760 --> 4:25:14.480\n and treat depression and Parkinson's\n\n4:25:14.480 --> 4:25:16.720\n and regrow nerves and so forth.\n\n4:25:16.720 --> 4:25:19.640\n Other things, they've shown some effectiveness\n\n4:25:19.640 --> 4:25:22.280\n against COVID, you know, it's just so crazy\n\n4:25:22.280 --> 4:25:24.200\n the diversity in the mushroom kingdom\n\n4:25:24.200 --> 4:25:29.200\n of the medicinal applications, the pesticide applications.\n\n4:25:29.580 --> 4:25:32.320\n You can use it a lot to kind of save hay and trees.\n\n4:25:32.320 --> 4:25:33.920\n There's a lot of things you can do\n\n4:25:33.920 --> 4:25:37.160\n to combat all kinds of invasive species.\n\n4:25:37.160 --> 4:25:39.600\n And it's true, there's a lot of cool stuff\n\n4:25:39.600 --> 4:25:42.080\n with psychedelic mushrooms and there's a great book\n\n4:25:42.080 --> 4:25:44.880\n from Michael Pollan, How to Change Your Mind,\n\n4:25:44.880 --> 4:25:46.320\n where he was really the first journalist\n\n4:25:46.320 --> 4:25:48.720\n a long time to go and Roland Griffiths\n\n4:25:48.720 --> 4:25:50.960\n work his way through the Johns Hopkins studies.\n\n4:25:50.960 --> 4:25:53.000\n But the long and short for me when I read that book,\n\n4:25:53.000 --> 4:25:54.880\n like, okay, mind expansion is great,\n\n4:25:54.880 --> 4:25:59.280\n but look at the effectiveness of psychedelics,\n\n4:25:59.280 --> 4:26:02.200\n psilocybin mushrooms with SSRIs,\n\n4:26:02.200 --> 4:26:04.000\n selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n\n4:26:04.000 --> 4:26:05.540\n for the treatment of depression.\n\n4:26:05.540 --> 4:26:07.840\n They showed in the Johns Hopkins studies\n\n4:26:07.840 --> 4:26:09.920\n that they're equal or better in effectiveness\n\n4:26:09.920 --> 4:26:13.720\n in many cases for the treatment of depression\n\n4:26:13.720 --> 4:26:16.660\n than a drug that you have to take forever.\n\n4:26:16.660 --> 4:26:18.560\n And this is just one or two treatments\n\n4:26:18.560 --> 4:26:20.520\n and then you desist from it.\n\n4:26:20.520 --> 4:26:22.640\n That's a miracle because there's so many people\n\n4:26:22.640 --> 4:26:26.760\n suffer from severe depression and it's a lifetime ailment.\n\n4:26:26.760 --> 4:26:29.040\n And the fact that we have something in the toolbox\n\n4:26:29.040 --> 4:26:32.400\n that we've underexplored is a very powerful thing.\n\n4:26:32.400 --> 4:26:34.520\n The other thing was end of life issues.\n\n4:26:34.520 --> 4:26:35.840\n A lot of people get cancer.\n\n4:26:35.840 --> 4:26:38.240\n I've lost people in the family from cancer.\n\n4:26:38.240 --> 4:26:41.120\n And it's so hard those last two, three months\n\n4:26:41.120 --> 4:26:43.320\n because they kind of have this,\n\n4:26:43.320 --> 4:26:45.720\n they're in a horrific pain, they're trying to find meaning\n\n4:26:45.720 --> 4:26:47.560\n and why is this happening to me?\n\n4:26:47.560 --> 4:26:49.200\n And if you can just give them a substance\n\n4:26:49.200 --> 4:26:51.120\n that on the other side of it, there's a good chance\n\n4:26:51.120 --> 4:26:52.720\n they can come to peace with everything\n\n4:26:52.720 --> 4:26:56.240\n and die with a lot more dignity and happiness.\n\n4:26:56.240 --> 4:26:59.440\n That alone justifies an enormous amount of study\n\n4:26:59.440 --> 4:27:01.560\n and the fact that these things are super cheap\n\n4:27:01.560 --> 4:27:03.920\n and they grow pretty much anywhere, it's pretty cool.\n\n4:27:03.920 --> 4:27:04.920\n Now on the commercial side,\n\n4:27:04.920 --> 4:27:07.000\n you can make a lot of money from mushrooms.\n\n4:27:07.000 --> 4:27:09.240\n I'm working with a company called Farmbox Foods\n\n4:27:09.240 --> 4:27:11.240\n and it's one of the,\n\n4:27:11.240 --> 4:27:13.600\n they do both vertical hydropartic farming,\n\n4:27:13.600 --> 4:27:18.240\n they also do mushroom and they put these amazing labs\n\n4:27:18.240 --> 4:27:20.080\n and shipping containers\n\n4:27:20.080 --> 4:27:22.080\n that are kind of like controlled environments.\n\n4:27:22.080 --> 4:27:24.280\n You grow 400 pounds of gourmet mushrooms\n\n4:27:24.280 --> 4:27:26.160\n a single week off of that.\n\n4:27:26.160 --> 4:27:28.480\n And your margins can be up to 30% per year.\n\n4:27:28.480 --> 4:27:31.360\n If you're just selling them for food consumption,\n\n4:27:31.360 --> 4:27:32.280\n if you're doing supplements,\n\n4:27:32.280 --> 4:27:34.400\n they can be even higher than that.\n\n4:27:34.400 --> 4:27:35.480\n So it just kind of made sense\n\n4:27:35.480 --> 4:27:37.320\n from a diversification of assets to say,\n\n4:27:37.320 --> 4:27:38.960\n hey, let's do some stuff in hydroponics\n\n4:27:38.960 --> 4:27:40.920\n and aquaponics and mushrooms.\n\n4:27:40.920 --> 4:27:43.280\n But the more I do and the more I learn that community,\n\n4:27:43.280 --> 4:27:45.400\n just the cooler that community is.\n\n4:27:45.400 --> 4:27:47.240\n Like I went to this beautiful mushroom festival\n\n4:27:47.240 --> 4:27:49.880\n in Cape Springs down in Georgia.\n\n4:27:49.880 --> 4:27:52.920\n And I met this guy named Bill Yule\n\n4:27:52.920 --> 4:27:55.040\n and he just looks like a druid.\n\n4:27:55.040 --> 4:27:56.680\n You know, it's just like he lives in a tree\n\n4:27:56.680 --> 4:27:58.680\n and he opens up the tree and goes out and everything.\n\n4:27:58.680 --> 4:27:59.840\n And I was like, Bill, what do you do?\n\n4:27:59.840 --> 4:28:03.480\n He said, I go and I try to study beetles and boletes\n\n4:28:03.480 --> 4:28:05.120\n and a very particular type of beetle.\n\n4:28:05.120 --> 4:28:07.640\n And they mate in the most crazy way.\n\n4:28:07.640 --> 4:28:10.520\n It's like this beetle will fuse on top of another beetle\n\n4:28:10.520 --> 4:28:11.680\n and they'll vibrate.\n\n4:28:11.680 --> 4:28:12.880\n And if they make the right harmony,\n\n4:28:12.880 --> 4:28:14.960\n she'll mate with them, otherwise they'll kick her off.\n\n4:28:14.960 --> 4:28:16.320\n And you can only make the harmony\n\n4:28:16.320 --> 4:28:18.840\n while you're on a specific type of bolete mushroom.\n\n4:28:18.840 --> 4:28:20.520\n If it's anywhere else, the harmony doesn't.\n\n4:28:20.520 --> 4:28:21.880\n It's like, who the fuck does this?\n\n4:28:21.880 --> 4:28:25.320\n It's like 20 years, 30 years just thinking\n\n4:28:25.320 --> 4:28:27.880\n about goddamn beetles and bolete mushrooms,\n\n4:28:27.880 --> 4:28:29.040\n but that's that community.\n\n4:28:29.040 --> 4:28:31.600\n And they're the happiest people you'll ever meet.\n\n4:28:31.600 --> 4:28:33.280\n And they're just so much fun to talk to.\n\n4:28:33.280 --> 4:28:36.520\n And there's just so much lore there that's not discovered.\n\n4:28:36.520 --> 4:28:39.800\n The other thing is there's a ton of undiscovered mushrooms.\n\n4:28:39.800 --> 4:28:42.080\n So, you go to my ranch up in Wyoming,\n\n4:28:42.080 --> 4:28:43.720\n go out that national forest next to it,\n\n4:28:43.720 --> 4:28:46.080\n you'll probably discover six or seven new species\n\n4:28:46.080 --> 4:28:49.000\n just doing some gene sequencing and things like that.\n\n4:28:49.000 --> 4:28:52.640\n So, there's like a gold rush for new things to discover,\n\n4:28:52.640 --> 4:28:53.920\n to treat all kinds of things.\n\n4:28:53.920 --> 4:28:55.640\n So, I love mushrooms, love that community.\n\n4:28:55.640 --> 4:28:57.840\n I think there's a lot of wonderful medicinal properties\n\n4:28:57.840 --> 4:29:00.840\n and everybody there is just a lot of fun to hang out with.\n\n4:29:00.840 --> 4:29:03.080\n The other passion is aquaponics and hydroponics.\n\n4:29:03.080 --> 4:29:06.080\n And I got a lot more serious after COVID.\n\n4:29:06.080 --> 4:29:08.640\n I go to the supermarket, all the store shelves are barren.\n\n4:29:08.640 --> 4:29:12.120\n I say, guys, can you imagine if we had a real big thing,\n\n4:29:12.120 --> 4:29:13.480\n what this would be like?\n\n4:29:13.480 --> 4:29:15.560\n We need to have domestic food production.\n\n4:29:15.560 --> 4:29:18.040\n We need to have resilience at the community level.\n\n4:29:18.040 --> 4:29:21.280\n So, let's go build a $40, $50 million aquaponics facility\n\n4:29:21.280 --> 4:29:23.440\n next to every major city.\n\n4:29:23.440 --> 4:29:26.360\n So, at least you have some local production of food\n\n4:29:26.360 --> 4:29:27.920\n and people won't starve to death.\n\n4:29:27.920 --> 4:29:29.720\n Otherwise, it's very bad.\n\n4:29:29.720 --> 4:29:32.960\n And again, the margins are phenomenal there, 20%, 30%,\n\n4:29:32.960 --> 4:29:34.200\n if you actually do it right\n\n4:29:34.200 --> 4:29:36.440\n and alternate your crops properly and so forth.\n\n4:29:36.440 --> 4:29:38.960\n And you create a lot of high paying jobs with it as well.\n\n4:29:38.960 --> 4:29:41.780\n And so, you kind of draw a lot of value\n\n4:29:41.780 --> 4:29:44.280\n from staying close to nature in all of these kinds of ways\n\n4:29:44.280 --> 4:29:45.580\n that are keeping you humble.\n\n4:29:45.580 --> 4:29:46.720\n Like you said, what is it?\n\n4:29:46.720 --> 4:29:49.200\n The goat is still gonna crap on you.\n\n4:29:49.200 --> 4:29:50.720\n Oh, yeah, the donkeys will shit on you\n\n4:29:50.720 --> 4:29:53.200\n whether you're broke or a billionaire.\n\n4:29:53.200 --> 4:29:54.040\n That's a good line.\n\n4:29:54.040 --> 4:29:59.040\n That's the line you'll be remembered for\n\n4:29:59.800 --> 4:30:01.440\n if the universe has a sense of humor.\n\n4:30:01.440 --> 4:30:03.600\n It's a neo Yogi Berra.\n\n4:30:04.520 --> 4:30:07.800\n So, I think mushrooms is a good place to ask\n\n4:30:07.800 --> 4:30:11.220\n about my friend, Joe Rogan.\n\n4:30:11.220 --> 4:30:13.320\n So, I keep folks from the Cardano community\n\n4:30:13.320 --> 4:30:15.900\n kept saying, keep saying things like,\n\n4:30:15.900 --> 4:30:18.880\n Lex podcasts first, then Joe Rogan experience.\n\n4:30:19.880 --> 4:30:22.940\n I guess I'm the moon and Joe is Mars in this metaphor.\n\n4:30:24.000 --> 4:30:26.400\n Since I'm a CS person, I can talk a little bit\n\n4:30:27.440 --> 4:30:29.120\n more fluently about cryptocurrency\n\n4:30:29.120 --> 4:30:31.600\n because fundamentally cryptocurrency\n\n4:30:31.600 --> 4:30:33.080\n is a computational idea.\n\n4:30:33.080 --> 4:30:34.800\n But then there's somebody like Joe\n\n4:30:34.800 --> 4:30:36.240\n who is more like an everyman.\n\n4:30:36.240 --> 4:30:39.360\n He does not necessarily know the technical intricacies\n\n4:30:39.360 --> 4:30:40.720\n of cryptocurrencies.\n\n4:30:40.720 --> 4:30:45.120\n And I don't think he's had a cryptocurrency person on.\n\n4:30:45.120 --> 4:30:47.480\n Didn't he interview Andreas on Todopolis?\n\n4:30:47.480 --> 4:30:48.320\n Oh, he did.\n\n4:30:48.320 --> 4:30:49.400\n That's right, a long, long time ago.\n\n4:30:49.400 --> 4:30:53.400\n But that was almost like the cryptocurrency space\n\n4:30:53.400 --> 4:30:54.880\n goes through phases.\n\n4:30:54.880 --> 4:30:57.600\n And I think we're in a new era of some kind.\n\n4:30:57.600 --> 4:31:01.840\n And how do you talk to Joe about Cardano?\n\n4:31:01.840 --> 4:31:04.880\n How do you talk to Joe about what the heck?\n\n4:31:04.880 --> 4:31:06.200\n I remember somebody tried to explain to him\n\n4:31:06.200 --> 4:31:07.960\n what Dogecoin is.\n\n4:31:07.960 --> 4:31:09.360\n How do you explain this whole space?\n\n4:31:09.360 --> 4:31:12.080\n Of where Bitcoin is, of where Ethereum is,\n\n4:31:12.080 --> 4:31:13.840\n of where Cardano and smart contracts\n\n4:31:13.840 --> 4:31:15.220\n and some of this proof of work,\n\n4:31:15.220 --> 4:31:17.080\n with this proof of stake ideas\n\n4:31:17.080 --> 4:31:18.500\n that we've been talking about.\n\n4:31:18.500 --> 4:31:19.340\n You don't.\n\n4:31:19.340 --> 4:31:20.880\n What you do is you start with applications\n\n4:31:20.880 --> 4:31:21.820\n that they're interested in.\n\n4:31:21.820 --> 4:31:22.920\n So he's an elk hunter.\n\n4:31:22.920 --> 4:31:25.840\n And so he's probably interested in elk tags, right?\n\n4:31:25.840 --> 4:31:27.080\n So you start there and you say,\n\n4:31:27.080 --> 4:31:29.200\n that whole system can be put on a blockchain\n\n4:31:29.200 --> 4:31:31.720\n and here's how it's gonna be better for you.\n\n4:31:31.720 --> 4:31:32.800\n You say, that's what you do.\n\n4:31:32.800 --> 4:31:35.120\n You always connect it to something they know and love.\n\n4:31:35.120 --> 4:31:36.640\n And then once they get that, they say,\n\n4:31:36.640 --> 4:31:37.840\n oh, that's really cool.\n\n4:31:37.840 --> 4:31:39.720\n And then they ask, what else can you do with it?\n\n4:31:39.720 --> 4:31:41.200\n What else can you sell me on it?\n\n4:31:41.200 --> 4:31:43.120\n And you kind of work your way outwards there.\n\n4:31:43.120 --> 4:31:45.480\n Problem technologists make is they're so damn in love\n\n4:31:45.480 --> 4:31:46.440\n with the technology.\n\n4:31:46.440 --> 4:31:48.160\n They have that tail wagging the dog\n\n4:31:48.160 --> 4:31:50.440\n where they just wanna talk about the technology\n\n4:31:50.440 --> 4:31:52.000\n and how incredibly cool it is.\n\n4:31:52.000 --> 4:31:52.820\n And that's fun.\n\n4:31:52.820 --> 4:31:53.720\n It's like talking about math.\n\n4:31:53.720 --> 4:31:55.820\n Oh God, let's talk about cool boardisms.\n\n4:31:55.820 --> 4:31:56.660\n That's fun.\n\n4:31:56.660 --> 4:31:58.120\n All right, yeah.\n\n4:31:58.120 --> 4:31:59.520\n Everybody's eyes glows over.\n\n4:31:59.520 --> 4:32:01.400\n No, you always have to connect it\n\n4:32:01.400 --> 4:32:03.500\n to the interest of the particular person\n\n4:32:03.500 --> 4:32:05.680\n and what they care about, what they love, what they need.\n\n4:32:05.680 --> 4:32:07.120\n Royalty payments.\n\n4:32:07.120 --> 4:32:08.080\n He's a big guy.\n\n4:32:08.080 --> 4:32:09.440\n He's got the Spotify thing.\n\n4:32:09.440 --> 4:32:11.000\n He's got all these things going on.\n\n4:32:11.000 --> 4:32:13.160\n Intellectual property is probably pretty important, Joe,\n\n4:32:13.160 --> 4:32:14.400\n at some juncture.\n\n4:32:14.400 --> 4:32:15.520\n So NFTs.\n\n4:32:15.520 --> 4:32:18.560\n We could talk about this concept of perpetual royalties.\n\n4:32:18.560 --> 4:32:21.480\n So for example, let's say that you create a piece of art.\n\n4:32:21.480 --> 4:32:24.280\n You can build into the token itself\n\n4:32:24.280 --> 4:32:26.720\n a perpetual royalty to something you care about.\n\n4:32:26.720 --> 4:32:29.680\n Maybe every time it sells, it pays it back to you.\n\n4:32:29.680 --> 4:32:31.460\n Or maybe every time it sells,\n\n4:32:31.460 --> 4:32:33.360\n it donate to some clean water charity\n\n4:32:33.360 --> 4:32:34.640\n or something like that.\n\n4:32:34.640 --> 4:32:36.960\n The point is that the actual acquisition\n\n4:32:36.960 --> 4:32:40.200\n of the NFT requires adherence to that smart contract.\n\n4:32:40.200 --> 4:32:43.840\n So people can't deviate from your desire even after you die.\n\n4:32:43.840 --> 4:32:46.920\n So stuff from Andy Warhol or from Picasso,\n\n4:32:46.920 --> 4:32:49.480\n that can still be generating some donation\n\n4:32:49.480 --> 4:32:52.120\n every time a Picasso sells to something else.\n\n4:32:52.120 --> 4:32:54.160\n You can do that with NFTs.\n\n4:32:54.160 --> 4:32:56.020\n And so he starts thinking, God, what else can I do?\n\n4:32:56.020 --> 4:32:56.960\n I do shows.\n\n4:32:56.960 --> 4:32:59.080\n Maybe I can do my tickets with these types of things.\n\n4:32:59.080 --> 4:33:01.320\n Maybe I can do loyalty points for my fans.\n\n4:33:01.320 --> 4:33:02.680\n So now you got him engaged,\n\n4:33:02.680 --> 4:33:04.840\n and he's thinking of all the opportunities for him,\n\n4:33:04.840 --> 4:33:07.200\n and it gives him an incentive to anchor\n\n4:33:07.200 --> 4:33:08.880\n and connect to those concepts.\n\n4:33:08.880 --> 4:33:11.200\n And then over time, he starts asking the question,\n\n4:33:11.200 --> 4:33:12.960\n well, how do we know it's secure?\n\n4:33:12.960 --> 4:33:15.400\n Then we can talk about proof of work or proof of stake\n\n4:33:15.400 --> 4:33:16.320\n or these types of things.\n\n4:33:16.320 --> 4:33:18.200\n Well, so this is how it stays secure\n\n4:33:18.200 --> 4:33:19.480\n if you're really interested.\n\n4:33:19.480 --> 4:33:22.860\n And there's an incentive to have the attention span\n\n4:33:22.860 --> 4:33:24.280\n necessary to do the homework,\n\n4:33:24.280 --> 4:33:25.920\n eat the broccoli and get over that hill.\n\n4:33:25.920 --> 4:33:27.880\n But it's also an opportunity, at least it was for me,\n\n4:33:27.880 --> 4:33:30.400\n especially with Bitcoin a while ago,\n\n4:33:30.400 --> 4:33:34.000\n is to take another look at the monetary system.\n\n4:33:34.000 --> 4:33:36.440\n Even look at the, I've been looking quite a bit\n\n4:33:36.440 --> 4:33:38.120\n at the history of the 20th century\n\n4:33:38.120 --> 4:33:39.960\n and sort of look at that history\n\n4:33:39.960 --> 4:33:42.280\n through the perspective of the monetary system,\n\n4:33:42.280 --> 4:33:44.080\n the gold standard and all those kinds of things.\n\n4:33:44.080 --> 4:33:47.400\n And you just add that little layer of consideration\n\n4:33:47.400 --> 4:33:49.280\n of how much money,\n\n4:33:49.280 --> 4:33:53.680\n of how money can be used by people in power\n\n4:33:53.680 --> 4:33:55.400\n to control the populace.\n\n4:33:55.400 --> 4:33:59.980\n And it's fascinating to look at the history\n\n4:33:59.980 --> 4:34:00.960\n from that perspective,\n\n4:34:00.960 --> 4:34:03.360\n and then that allows you to look at the future\n\n4:34:03.360 --> 4:34:06.700\n of how we can change that in order to empower people.\n\n4:34:06.700 --> 4:34:09.800\n And then of course, the governance thing\n\n4:34:09.800 --> 4:34:11.240\n that you're working on is fascinating\n\n4:34:11.240 --> 4:34:13.620\n because I mean, I don't know,\n\n4:34:13.620 --> 4:34:16.880\n but it seems like deeply broken aspect of our government\n\n4:34:16.880 --> 4:34:18.840\n is just the voting system.\n\n4:34:18.840 --> 4:34:21.760\n And discussing how that could be revolutionized\n\n4:34:21.760 --> 4:34:22.820\n is fascinating.\n\n4:34:22.820 --> 4:34:27.720\n Because a lot of conversations end up being on the internet\n\n4:34:27.720 --> 4:34:30.960\n about like number go up, which is like financial side.\n\n4:34:30.960 --> 4:34:34.480\n And to me personally at least, I think that's the same\n\n4:34:34.480 --> 4:34:36.760\n for Joe is that's just boring.\n\n4:34:36.760 --> 4:34:40.140\n Like it's the investing, the financial side of it,\n\n4:34:40.140 --> 4:34:43.360\n I know it has a lot of impact, but it's kind of boring.\n\n4:34:43.360 --> 4:34:45.080\n Cause longterm is not gonna have any impact.\n\n4:34:45.080 --> 4:34:48.040\n If the idea is a strong longterm, it's going to win.\n\n4:34:48.040 --> 4:34:50.400\n The idea is a weak, longterm is gonna lose.\n\n4:34:50.400 --> 4:34:52.800\n The ups and downs of the short term don't matter.\n\n4:34:52.800 --> 4:34:57.180\n That's just like casino games that you play.\n\n4:34:58.160 --> 4:35:00.220\n Speaking of games, video games,\n\n4:35:00.220 --> 4:35:01.320\n gotta ask you about those.\n\n4:35:01.320 --> 4:35:02.160\n Okay.\n\n4:35:02.160 --> 4:35:04.240\n You mentioned Diablo, maybe you're a fan of Diablo.\n\n4:35:04.240 --> 4:35:06.200\n Well, yeah, and Diablo 2 was great.\n\n4:35:06.200 --> 4:35:07.260\n Do you like Skyrim?\n\n4:35:07.260 --> 4:35:08.580\n Skyrim was great too.\n\n4:35:08.580 --> 4:35:09.420\n Like the Elder Scrolls.\n\n4:35:09.420 --> 4:35:11.260\n I actually bought the game that the Elder Scrolls\n\n4:35:11.260 --> 4:35:13.000\n was based on, do you know that?\n\n4:35:13.000 --> 4:35:16.320\n So way back in the day, the Elder Scrolls series\n\n4:35:16.320 --> 4:35:18.600\n was inspired by a game called Legends of Valor\n\n4:35:18.600 --> 4:35:20.120\n that I played when I was a little kid.\n\n4:35:20.120 --> 4:35:22.000\n And it doesn't actually have an ending.\n\n4:35:22.000 --> 4:35:23.640\n They ran out of money before they finished it.\n\n4:35:23.640 --> 4:35:25.680\n So they just kind of like put this little thing on\n\n4:35:25.680 --> 4:35:27.460\n and said, okay, but you never finish it.\n\n4:35:27.460 --> 4:35:29.680\n So I actually bought all the intellectual property\n\n4:35:29.680 --> 4:35:30.520\n of the game.\n\n4:35:30.520 --> 4:35:31.340\n I saw that.\n\n4:35:31.340 --> 4:35:32.180\n I didn't know there was a connection\n\n4:35:32.180 --> 4:35:33.000\n between Legends of Valor and Arena.\n\n4:35:33.000 --> 4:35:34.720\n Yeah, well, I forget the name.\n\n4:35:34.720 --> 4:35:37.640\n The guy, was it Todd something at Bethesda?\n\n4:35:37.640 --> 4:35:40.280\n He played it and he was inspired by it\n\n4:35:40.280 --> 4:35:42.520\n and then he created Arena right after playing it.\n\n4:35:42.520 --> 4:35:43.800\n That was such a good game.\n\n4:35:43.800 --> 4:35:45.260\n Arena, Daggerfall.\n\n4:35:45.260 --> 4:35:46.100\n Yeah.\n\n4:35:46.100 --> 4:35:47.080\n Yeah.\n\n4:35:47.080 --> 4:35:48.960\n I had a copy of Daggerfall when I was a kid,\n\n4:35:48.960 --> 4:35:51.000\n but it had a bug and so when you left the dungeon,\n\n4:35:51.000 --> 4:35:51.960\n it would crash.\n\n4:35:51.960 --> 4:35:54.880\n And this was before, like you can get an easy patch for it.\n\n4:35:54.880 --> 4:35:56.920\n So I never actually played Daggerfall.\n\n4:35:56.920 --> 4:36:00.120\n I entered in through Morrowind.\n\n4:36:00.120 --> 4:36:02.920\n Yeah, no, the Daggerfall was the fascinating thing.\n\n4:36:02.920 --> 4:36:04.040\n We were just jumping all over,\n\n4:36:04.040 --> 4:36:05.520\n but we'll return to Legends of Valor\n\n4:36:05.520 --> 4:36:06.480\n because I want to ask you about that.\n\n4:36:06.480 --> 4:36:07.760\n But Daggerfall was fascinating\n\n4:36:07.760 --> 4:36:11.140\n because I think of all the other scroll games,\n\n4:36:11.140 --> 4:36:12.320\n it was like the largest\n\n4:36:12.320 --> 4:36:15.600\n because it was like randomly generated.\n\n4:36:15.600 --> 4:36:17.240\n It would like randomly generate the worlds,\n\n4:36:17.240 --> 4:36:18.760\n the dungeons and so on,\n\n4:36:18.760 --> 4:36:20.560\n which is fascinating to think about like,\n\n4:36:20.560 --> 4:36:25.560\n how big can you make the world both in actuality and feel?\n\n4:36:25.560 --> 4:36:29.400\n Like it's incredible to have a video game,\n\n4:36:29.400 --> 4:36:32.200\n I don't know how many video games do this well,\n\n4:36:32.200 --> 4:36:35.920\n where the feeling is you can be lost here forever.\n\n4:36:35.920 --> 4:36:39.520\n You can live here because most video games\n\n4:36:39.520 --> 4:36:40.840\n have like a bottom.\n\n4:36:40.840 --> 4:36:42.600\n It feels like you can run out of stuff.\n\n4:36:42.600 --> 4:36:45.800\n When Daggerfall was like, I can just keep doing this.\n\n4:36:45.800 --> 4:36:47.200\n At least that's what I felt at the time.\n\n4:36:47.200 --> 4:36:50.240\n But yeah, what the heck Legends of Valor?\n\n4:36:50.240 --> 4:36:51.800\n What's the idea there?\n\n4:36:51.800 --> 4:36:54.700\n Well, I mean, there's really nothing about it\n\n4:36:54.700 --> 4:36:56.280\n that's super compelling today.\n\n4:36:56.280 --> 4:36:59.400\n I mean, there's a nostalgia of youth that's there,\n\n4:36:59.400 --> 4:37:00.920\n but I mean, it doesn't even have a class system,\n\n4:37:00.920 --> 4:37:03.520\n a level system, the combat system is terrible.\n\n4:37:03.520 --> 4:37:04.360\n There's no journal,\n\n4:37:04.360 --> 4:37:06.260\n the magic system is terrible and so forth.\n\n4:37:06.260 --> 4:37:08.160\n And so I just wanted to start somewhere\n\n4:37:08.160 --> 4:37:09.220\n and I felt like that would be\n\n4:37:09.220 --> 4:37:11.120\n an incredibly fun overhaul project.\n\n4:37:11.120 --> 4:37:13.160\n I kind of got the idea from Beamdog Studios\n\n4:37:13.160 --> 4:37:15.180\n when they did another one of my favorite games,\n\n4:37:15.180 --> 4:37:16.960\n remember Baldur's Gate?\n\n4:37:16.960 --> 4:37:17.800\n Yeah, they did the enhanced.\n\n4:37:17.800 --> 4:37:18.760\n I love that Baldur's Gate too.\n\n4:37:18.760 --> 4:37:21.000\n Oh yeah, the enhanced edition was great.\n\n4:37:21.000 --> 4:37:22.880\n They should have never just done thrown a ball,\n\n4:37:22.880 --> 4:37:24.920\n they should have done an actual proper sequel\n\n4:37:24.920 --> 4:37:27.520\n and gone down that whole road.\n\n4:37:27.520 --> 4:37:29.920\n But anyway, I got the idea there.\n\n4:37:29.920 --> 4:37:32.480\n I said, well, take some old piece of IP\n\n4:37:32.480 --> 4:37:34.940\n and then you can kind of retrofit it and clean it up.\n\n4:37:34.940 --> 4:37:36.440\n And what's nice about Legends of Valor\n\n4:37:36.440 --> 4:37:37.440\n is it's a blank slate.\n\n4:37:37.440 --> 4:37:39.280\n You can do your own Elder Scrolls,\n\n4:37:39.280 --> 4:37:40.600\n you can create your own class system\n\n4:37:40.600 --> 4:37:42.580\n and level system and so forth.\n\n4:37:42.580 --> 4:37:43.880\n You could write some beautiful,\n\n4:37:43.880 --> 4:37:46.280\n exciting, fun narratives for that.\n\n4:37:46.280 --> 4:37:49.040\n And also it gives me a chance to explore a lot of things\n\n4:37:49.040 --> 4:37:50.920\n I think should be dragged into game development,\n\n4:37:50.920 --> 4:37:52.600\n like algorithmically generated music\n\n4:37:52.600 --> 4:37:53.720\n is one example.\n\n4:37:53.720 --> 4:37:55.920\n The problem with games, as you mentioned,\n\n4:37:55.920 --> 4:37:57.940\n you play lots and lots of hours,\n\n4:37:57.940 --> 4:38:00.040\n but your sound content is much smaller.\n\n4:38:00.040 --> 4:38:02.600\n So you have tons of repetition in the soundtrack.\n\n4:38:02.600 --> 4:38:05.040\n So what if you could connect the music\n\n4:38:05.040 --> 4:38:06.700\n to the state of the game world\n\n4:38:06.700 --> 4:38:08.680\n and it automatically through some process\n\n4:38:08.680 --> 4:38:09.520\n will generate music.\n\n4:38:09.520 --> 4:38:11.760\n And there's actually people who study this.\n\n4:38:11.760 --> 4:38:12.920\n And so that's one dimension.\n\n4:38:12.920 --> 4:38:15.120\n The other thing is you have things like GPT3 and so forth.\n\n4:38:15.120 --> 4:38:18.280\n There was a great game, Event Zero,\n\n4:38:18.280 --> 4:38:21.400\n and it came out like 2016 where you could actually\n\n4:38:21.400 --> 4:38:25.160\n have a dialogue with an AI and you're like a marooned\n\n4:38:25.160 --> 4:38:28.000\n astronaut on a space station that's abandoned.\n\n4:38:28.000 --> 4:38:30.580\n And you have to somehow work with this AI\n\n4:38:30.580 --> 4:38:32.760\n through communicating with it to convince you\n\n4:38:32.760 --> 4:38:34.720\n to take you home.\n\n4:38:34.720 --> 4:38:37.000\n But the AI is a bit duplicitous.\n\n4:38:37.000 --> 4:38:38.800\n And I don't wanna spoil the plot of the game\n\n4:38:38.800 --> 4:38:39.980\n because it's such a cool game,\n\n4:38:39.980 --> 4:38:41.800\n but it's actually like a paint by numbers.\n\n4:38:41.800 --> 4:38:45.100\n It's almost like Zork where you don't have\n\n4:38:45.100 --> 4:38:46.520\n preselected dialogue.\n\n4:38:46.520 --> 4:38:48.280\n You actually type in the terminal\n\n4:38:48.280 --> 4:38:50.360\n and the AI will reply to you back and forth.\n\n4:38:50.360 --> 4:38:52.560\n And this was 2016 and it's like things have gotten\n\n4:38:52.560 --> 4:38:54.160\n an order of magnitude better.\n\n4:38:54.160 --> 4:38:55.720\n So the evolution of that tech,\n\n4:38:55.720 --> 4:38:57.320\n I think within the next five years,\n\n4:38:57.320 --> 4:38:59.040\n brought into video games could give you\n\n4:38:59.040 --> 4:39:02.920\n incredibly cool dialogue inside the game.\n\n4:39:02.920 --> 4:39:04.560\n So algorithmically generated music,\n\n4:39:04.560 --> 4:39:06.560\n better dialogue, better gameplay mechanics.\n\n4:39:06.560 --> 4:39:10.720\n Also, I'd love to explore alternative physics systems,\n\n4:39:10.720 --> 4:39:14.520\n alternative geometries like hyperbolic geometry\n\n4:39:14.520 --> 4:39:15.600\n or these types of things.\n\n4:39:15.600 --> 4:39:19.060\n And there's actually Hyperbolica is a game that does that.\n\n4:39:19.060 --> 4:39:21.480\n And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well\n\n4:39:21.480 --> 4:39:23.640\n and bring those elements into a game design.\n\n4:39:23.640 --> 4:39:25.200\n And that's what we'll do with Legends of Valor.\n\n4:39:25.200 --> 4:39:26.640\n So it'll be kind of like Skyrim,\n\n4:39:26.640 --> 4:39:28.600\n but with a lot of really cool new shit.\n\n4:39:28.600 --> 4:39:30.960\n It's kind of like, I saw Aerosmith years ago\n\n4:39:30.960 --> 4:39:31.800\n and he was out there, he's like,\n\n4:39:31.800 --> 4:39:32.800\n do you like the old shit?\n\n4:39:32.800 --> 4:39:34.280\n Do you like new shit?\n\n4:39:34.280 --> 4:39:36.280\n Kind of middle shit, you know?\n\n4:39:36.280 --> 4:39:37.120\n So.\n\n4:39:37.120 --> 4:39:38.080\n So you're going for the middle.\n\n4:39:38.080 --> 4:39:39.900\n Yeah, I'm gonna try to do some of the old\n\n4:39:39.900 --> 4:39:41.720\n and some of the new and bring it in.\n\n4:39:41.720 --> 4:39:43.520\n So that'll be a lot of fun.\n\n4:39:43.520 --> 4:39:49.080\n And what's nice about it is that there is a lot of\n\n4:39:49.080 --> 4:39:51.840\n new play in the market\n\n4:39:51.840 --> 4:39:54.480\n because of the Microsoft acquisition of Bethesda.\n\n4:39:54.480 --> 4:39:56.520\n They've been losing employees like crazy\n\n4:39:56.520 --> 4:39:58.440\n and there's a lot of belief that Elder Scrolls 6\n\n4:39:58.440 --> 4:40:00.280\n will not live up to expectations\n\n4:40:00.280 --> 4:40:01.360\n because Microsoft will kill it.\n\n4:40:01.360 --> 4:40:02.560\n I will tweet.\n\n4:40:02.560 --> 4:40:03.800\n Okay, listen to me.\n\n4:40:03.800 --> 4:40:07.960\n I will go into, I'm all about love on the internet,\n\n4:40:07.960 --> 4:40:09.840\n but I will go hard at you Microsoft\n\n4:40:09.840 --> 4:40:11.440\n if you screw up Elder Scrolls.\n\n4:40:11.440 --> 4:40:14.160\n Well, we might have to do a spiritual successor, right?\n\n4:40:14.160 --> 4:40:16.160\n It might have to happen with Legends of Valor.\n\n4:40:16.160 --> 4:40:17.480\n You never know.\n\n4:40:17.480 --> 4:40:18.600\n But it's a passion project,\n\n4:40:18.600 --> 4:40:20.360\n so I have no time for it at all.\n\n4:40:20.360 --> 4:40:22.120\n It's like solo on my list of things to do.\n\n4:40:22.120 --> 4:40:24.680\n So I'll probably do it in 2022, 2023\n\n4:40:24.680 --> 4:40:27.480\n and we'll build a nice crew and we'll do it in Wyoming,\n\n4:40:27.480 --> 4:40:29.560\n probably in Wheatland or some really small town\n\n4:40:29.560 --> 4:40:31.320\n and we'll import everybody\n\n4:40:31.320 --> 4:40:32.980\n and then we'll have to build the whole city up\n\n4:40:32.980 --> 4:40:34.840\n like Elon is doing here in Texas.\n\n4:40:34.840 --> 4:40:36.760\n It'll be a fun project.\n\n4:40:36.760 --> 4:40:38.600\n Well, I like programmatically generated music.\n\n4:40:38.600 --> 4:40:40.440\n You mentioned Baldur's Gate.\n\n4:40:40.440 --> 4:40:41.920\n By the way, Haskell frameworks for that.\n\n4:40:41.920 --> 4:40:43.000\n Euterpe is one.\n\n4:40:43.000 --> 4:40:44.000\n For generating music?\n\n4:40:44.000 --> 4:40:45.440\n Yeah, for doing it.\n\n4:40:45.440 --> 4:40:46.680\n I wonder how successful that could be\n\n4:40:46.680 --> 4:40:49.120\n because I remember Baldur's Gate was the first game\n\n4:40:49.120 --> 4:40:52.200\n where I realized music is so important to the game.\n\n4:40:52.200 --> 4:40:54.160\n It was the thing I remembered about the game.\n\n4:40:54.160 --> 4:40:55.480\n It was the reason that,\n\n4:40:55.480 --> 4:40:57.500\n it was the thing I thought about\n\n4:40:57.500 --> 4:40:59.480\n when I was away from the game\n\n4:40:59.480 --> 4:41:02.760\n is like the feeling it created, that music.\n\n4:41:02.760 --> 4:41:04.600\n I don't even remember the music anymore,\n\n4:41:04.600 --> 4:41:05.440\n but I remember the music.\n\n4:41:05.440 --> 4:41:08.160\n Bum, bum, dum, dum.\n\n4:41:08.160 --> 4:41:10.760\n Jeremy Soule, I think was the composer.\n\n4:41:10.760 --> 4:41:12.000\n It was great.\n\n4:41:12.000 --> 4:41:13.960\n And actually getting like Raman Juwadi\n\n4:41:13.960 --> 4:41:17.000\n or Bear McCready in to do that, that would be so cool.\n\n4:41:17.000 --> 4:41:19.600\n Okay, this is awesome.\n\n4:41:19.600 --> 4:41:20.500\n Ridiculous question.\n\n4:41:20.500 --> 4:41:23.200\n What's the, maybe let's say top three\n\n4:41:23.200 --> 4:41:25.080\n graded video games of all time?\n\n4:41:26.680 --> 4:41:28.360\n Yeah, Baldur's Gate is definitely in the top three.\n\n4:41:28.360 --> 4:41:30.280\n Arcanum is my favorite game.\n\n4:41:30.280 --> 4:41:34.440\n And Arcanum was, Troika Games was just this amazing studio\n\n4:41:34.440 --> 4:41:38.360\n where they took the time to build probably\n\n4:41:38.360 --> 4:41:40.480\n the most compelling game worlds.\n\n4:41:40.480 --> 4:41:42.160\n In the case of Arcanum, it takes place\n\n4:41:42.160 --> 4:41:44.960\n in kind of like a 19th century Victorian England play.\n\n4:41:44.960 --> 4:41:47.520\n So steampunk, but then there's also magic\n\n4:41:47.520 --> 4:41:48.600\n inside this game world.\n\n4:41:48.600 --> 4:41:50.680\n And there's this crazy juxtaposition\n\n4:41:50.680 --> 4:41:52.020\n between magic and technology.\n\n4:41:52.020 --> 4:41:54.700\n And the more technology you have, magic stops working.\n\n4:41:54.700 --> 4:41:57.160\n The more magic you have, it disrupts technology.\n\n4:41:57.160 --> 4:41:58.600\n So all the people on the magic side\n\n4:41:58.600 --> 4:42:00.840\n hate the technology people and vice versa.\n\n4:42:00.840 --> 4:42:03.320\n And so you're just this character in this game world\n\n4:42:03.320 --> 4:42:06.080\n and you're just trying to figure out like where do you fit?\n\n4:42:06.080 --> 4:42:08.720\n And it has this incredible plot\n\n4:42:08.720 --> 4:42:11.640\n where you're kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin\n\n4:42:11.640 --> 4:42:13.980\n that gets shot down and you get dragged\n\n4:42:13.980 --> 4:42:16.860\n into this conspiracy and you have to kind of figure out\n\n4:42:16.860 --> 4:42:18.880\n the conspiracy as you go through the whole game world.\n\n4:42:18.880 --> 4:42:20.160\n And you meet all these different races\n\n4:42:20.160 --> 4:42:21.920\n like the elves and the dwarves and so forth.\n\n4:42:21.920 --> 4:42:24.240\n And they've all been impacted by the proliferation\n\n4:42:24.240 --> 4:42:25.620\n of technology in different ways.\n\n4:42:25.620 --> 4:42:27.920\n Like the humans use steam engines\n\n4:42:27.920 --> 4:42:30.720\n to clear cut all the forest and it caused a lot of problems.\n\n4:42:30.720 --> 4:42:33.440\n The dwarves leaked that technology to the humans\n\n4:42:33.440 --> 4:42:36.080\n and so they kind of got exiled for it and so forth.\n\n4:42:36.080 --> 4:42:38.100\n And you have to decide like where do you fit in all of this?\n\n4:42:38.100 --> 4:42:39.960\n And you have a lot of choices as a player.\n\n4:42:39.960 --> 4:42:42.040\n You can be on the magic side, the technology side,\n\n4:42:42.040 --> 4:42:43.640\n kind of be neutral.\n\n4:42:43.640 --> 4:42:46.120\n And there's like 40 different endings for the game.\n\n4:42:46.120 --> 4:42:47.360\n It's just incredible.\n\n4:42:47.360 --> 4:42:48.800\n And this is all like 2000.\n\n4:42:48.800 --> 4:42:51.160\n And then you talk about a procedurally generated world.\n\n4:42:51.160 --> 4:42:53.040\n You have a quick travel, but if you want,\n\n4:42:53.040 --> 4:42:55.000\n you can just walk and the world randomly generates.\n\n4:42:55.000 --> 4:42:56.080\n But it's not like Daggerfall\n\n4:42:56.080 --> 4:42:58.000\n where there was interesting things along the way.\n\n4:42:58.000 --> 4:42:59.780\n So it was really ahead of its time\n\n4:42:59.780 --> 4:43:03.320\n and it was kind of the last of a generation of games.\n\n4:43:03.320 --> 4:43:05.360\n It was based on the same framework\n\n4:43:05.360 --> 4:43:07.280\n that Interplay used for Fallout,\n\n4:43:07.280 --> 4:43:09.400\n the original Fallout and Fallout 2.\n\n4:43:09.400 --> 4:43:11.240\n So that was really a cool setup.\n\n4:43:11.240 --> 4:43:13.000\n How were the graphics that were not essential to the game?\n\n4:43:13.000 --> 4:43:15.640\n Oh, it's isometric, top down.\n\n4:43:15.640 --> 4:43:17.920\n So kind of like the Fallout look.\n\n4:43:17.920 --> 4:43:21.520\n And so it doesn't hold up super well today,\n\n4:43:21.520 --> 4:43:22.880\n but that was never the point.\n\n4:43:22.880 --> 4:43:24.920\n It was more of a story driven game.\n\n4:43:24.920 --> 4:43:26.740\n But it was one of the very few games\n\n4:43:26.740 --> 4:43:27.800\n where at the very end of the game,\n\n4:43:27.800 --> 4:43:31.000\n you can actually talk the villain into killing himself\n\n4:43:31.000 --> 4:43:33.480\n instead of fighting you.\n\n4:43:33.480 --> 4:43:35.520\n If you, and you had to really work at it,\n\n4:43:35.520 --> 4:43:37.340\n you had to become a master of persuasion\n\n4:43:37.340 --> 4:43:39.300\n and get your charisma score maxed out\n\n4:43:39.300 --> 4:43:40.840\n and learn all this stuff along the way.\n\n4:43:40.840 --> 4:43:42.480\n And you have this philosophical debate\n\n4:43:42.480 --> 4:43:44.080\n over the nature of life and death with him.\n\n4:43:44.080 --> 4:43:44.920\n That's amazing.\n\n4:43:44.920 --> 4:43:45.880\n Yeah, and then you're just like,\n\n4:43:45.880 --> 4:43:47.480\n by the way, you're wrong and here's why.\n\n4:43:47.480 --> 4:43:48.720\n And he's like, oh yeah, you got a point.\n\n4:43:48.720 --> 4:43:50.040\n I'm just gonna kill myself.\n\n4:43:50.040 --> 4:43:52.940\n I was like, wow, this is great.\n\n4:43:52.940 --> 4:43:54.880\n Planescape Torment is the other one,\n\n4:43:54.880 --> 4:43:56.080\n I think is probably the greatest.\n\n4:43:56.080 --> 4:43:57.240\n Was it called Planescape?\n\n4:43:57.240 --> 4:43:59.480\n Yeah, it's another one on the Infinity Engine,\n\n4:43:59.480 --> 4:44:01.360\n which was what was used for Baldur's Gate.\n\n4:44:01.360 --> 4:44:02.680\n So it looks like Baldur's Gate.\n\n4:44:02.680 --> 4:44:06.020\n And God, that was such an incredibly well written game.\n\n4:44:06.020 --> 4:44:07.760\n You play this character called the Nameless One,\n\n4:44:07.760 --> 4:44:10.120\n this little blue guy, and you wake up in a morgue.\n\n4:44:10.120 --> 4:44:11.940\n And it turns out that you're a mortal.\n\n4:44:11.940 --> 4:44:14.260\n And every time you die, you lose all your memories.\n\n4:44:14.260 --> 4:44:17.440\n And so you've just been apparently living this life\n\n4:44:17.440 --> 4:44:18.680\n for a very long time.\n\n4:44:18.680 --> 4:44:20.040\n And you meet all these people\n\n4:44:20.040 --> 4:44:22.380\n in this crazy city called Sigil who know you,\n\n4:44:22.380 --> 4:44:23.720\n but you don't know yourself.\n\n4:44:23.720 --> 4:44:25.760\n And you're trying to figure out your name, your identity,\n\n4:44:25.760 --> 4:44:28.800\n and why do you have this curse where you live forever,\n\n4:44:28.800 --> 4:44:31.200\n but you keep forgetting every time you get killed.\n\n4:44:31.200 --> 4:44:33.680\n And it turns out you weren't such a nice person\n\n4:44:33.680 --> 4:44:35.160\n throughout this entire game world.\n\n4:44:35.160 --> 4:44:36.640\n But then again, there's this question of,\n\n4:44:36.640 --> 4:44:40.400\n well, if you can start over and you lose all your memories,\n\n4:44:40.400 --> 4:44:42.760\n do you have a chance for redemption or not?\n\n4:44:42.760 --> 4:44:45.160\n So it's an incredible game, Planescape Torment.\n\n4:44:45.160 --> 4:44:46.600\n And it's actually another one of those games\n\n4:44:46.600 --> 4:44:49.000\n where you can never actually have a fight.\n\n4:44:49.000 --> 4:44:50.880\n You can just kind of talk your way out of everything.\n\n4:44:50.880 --> 4:44:53.680\n And there's probably like a thousand pages of dialogue\n\n4:44:53.680 --> 4:44:54.520\n inside the game.\n\n4:44:54.520 --> 4:44:56.440\n You guys had a lot of fun and a lot of drugs\n\n4:44:56.440 --> 4:44:57.840\n making that game.\n\n4:44:57.840 --> 4:45:00.480\n Do you think these three games are the kinds\n\n4:45:00.480 --> 4:45:02.400\n that would still be okay to play today\n\n4:45:02.400 --> 4:45:03.920\n or are they forever lost in time\n\n4:45:03.920 --> 4:45:08.360\n because we sort of got desensitized\n\n4:45:08.360 --> 4:45:10.560\n to the richness of computer graphics\n\n4:45:10.560 --> 4:45:12.400\n and all those kinds of things in modern games?\n\n4:45:12.400 --> 4:45:14.000\n I think you can enhance these games\n\n4:45:14.000 --> 4:45:17.600\n because your storytelling medium is so much more engaging.\n\n4:45:17.600 --> 4:45:19.440\n I was at the movie theater before COVID\n\n4:45:19.440 --> 4:45:21.160\n and the person to the left of me\n\n4:45:21.160 --> 4:45:23.040\n was looking at their cell phone during the movie.\n\n4:45:23.040 --> 4:45:24.000\n And the person to the right of me\n\n4:45:24.000 --> 4:45:25.080\n was looking at their cell phone.\n\n4:45:25.080 --> 4:45:26.320\n They're just not engaged anymore.\n\n4:45:26.320 --> 4:45:28.560\n Everybody is attention starved.\n\n4:45:28.560 --> 4:45:30.600\n And the video game is one of the last mediums\n\n4:45:30.600 --> 4:45:33.160\n where you have undivided attention of people.\n\n4:45:33.160 --> 4:45:34.640\n They're really into it.\n\n4:45:34.640 --> 4:45:35.960\n They're all into that thing.\n\n4:45:35.960 --> 4:45:39.080\n And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR\n\n4:45:39.080 --> 4:45:42.480\n and enhanced graphics and all these new gameplay mechanics,\n\n4:45:42.480 --> 4:45:44.920\n it's a value add instead of a value negative\n\n4:45:44.920 --> 4:45:46.080\n because ultimately what are you doing?\n\n4:45:46.080 --> 4:45:47.720\n You're telling stories\n\n4:45:47.720 --> 4:45:49.760\n and you're trying to connect people to something.\n\n4:45:49.760 --> 4:45:52.040\n Maybe it's the nature of life and death\n\n4:45:52.040 --> 4:45:53.480\n or are we truly real?\n\n4:45:53.480 --> 4:45:55.640\n Or are we in a simulation or not or something like,\n\n4:45:55.640 --> 4:45:57.520\n it'd be great to do 13th floor as a game\n\n4:45:57.520 --> 4:45:59.320\n or something like that.\n\n4:45:59.320 --> 4:46:02.120\n And the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell?\n\n4:46:02.120 --> 4:46:02.960\n Well, you're constrained\n\n4:46:02.960 --> 4:46:05.200\n by your storytelling tools and technology.\n\n4:46:05.200 --> 4:46:07.680\n The fact that games are so much more advanced now\n\n4:46:07.680 --> 4:46:10.160\n means that you now have many more dimensions\n\n4:46:10.160 --> 4:46:12.120\n of storytelling available to you.\n\n4:46:12.120 --> 4:46:14.160\n And actually with AI now coming in\n\n4:46:14.160 --> 4:46:17.480\n and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years,\n\n4:46:17.480 --> 4:46:20.040\n your storytelling is not static anymore.\n\n4:46:20.040 --> 4:46:22.880\n The person can actually majorly participate\n\n4:46:22.880 --> 4:46:24.360\n and change the outcome in ways\n\n4:46:24.360 --> 4:46:26.280\n that were previously unpredictable.\n\n4:46:26.280 --> 4:46:27.720\n The other thing is they're still educational.\n\n4:46:27.720 --> 4:46:30.560\n You can teach people concepts that they never knew before.\n\n4:46:30.560 --> 4:46:32.200\n And it's like, if you wanna teach people\n\n4:46:32.200 --> 4:46:35.280\n about bizarre geometries or like Minecraft\n\n4:46:35.280 --> 4:46:36.760\n is a great example.\n\n4:46:36.760 --> 4:46:40.160\n A lot of people learned how computers work from Redstone.\n\n4:46:40.160 --> 4:46:41.800\n Think about that.\n\n4:46:41.800 --> 4:46:42.640\n It's true.\n\n4:46:42.640 --> 4:46:43.960\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n4:46:43.960 --> 4:46:45.880\n Yeah, I mean, yeah, as we said,\n\n4:46:45.880 --> 4:46:47.480\n we're more and more going to be living\n\n4:46:47.480 --> 4:46:50.280\n in a video game worlds might as well\n\n4:46:50.280 --> 4:46:52.960\n sort of as opposed to just make it fun,\n\n4:46:52.960 --> 4:46:55.560\n also expand our knowledge,\n\n4:46:55.560 --> 4:46:57.880\n expand our ability to think,\n\n4:46:57.880 --> 4:47:00.440\n like explore different ideas\n\n4:47:00.440 --> 4:47:02.360\n and do education broadly defined\n\n4:47:02.360 --> 4:47:03.760\n within those video game worlds.\n\n4:47:03.760 --> 4:47:05.120\n So we do the entirety,\n\n4:47:05.120 --> 4:47:08.240\n the entirety of life in the video game worlds.\n\n4:47:08.240 --> 4:47:11.280\n Hopefully it doesn't look like Minecraft, but we'll see.\n\n4:47:11.280 --> 4:47:13.680\n Do you have advice for young people today\n\n4:47:13.680 --> 4:47:16.440\n aside from playing lots of video games?\n\n4:47:16.440 --> 4:47:19.080\n You know, high schoolers, college students,\n\n4:47:19.080 --> 4:47:22.080\n thinking about their career, thinking about life.\n\n4:47:23.320 --> 4:47:24.720\n Well, we no longer live in a world\n\n4:47:24.720 --> 4:47:25.840\n where you get one skill set,\n\n4:47:25.840 --> 4:47:28.280\n you do it for 40 years and retire.\n\n4:47:28.280 --> 4:47:30.400\n I mean, that ship has sailed a long time ago.\n\n4:47:30.400 --> 4:47:33.360\n So learn how to learn and learn an appreciation\n\n4:47:33.360 --> 4:47:34.640\n and love for learning.\n\n4:47:34.640 --> 4:47:36.120\n So that's the first thing, you know,\n\n4:47:36.120 --> 4:47:37.840\n Josh Waitzkins wrote this beautiful book,\n\n4:47:37.840 --> 4:47:39.920\n The Art of Learning, if you ever read it.\n\n4:47:39.920 --> 4:47:41.480\n Stuff like that.\n\n4:47:41.480 --> 4:47:43.200\n So good study skills, you know,\n\n4:47:43.200 --> 4:47:44.760\n slip box notes, these things.\n\n4:47:44.760 --> 4:47:48.080\n What was it, Zettelkasten or whatever it is.\n\n4:47:48.080 --> 4:47:49.480\n Yeah, there's a lot of little techniques\n\n4:47:49.480 --> 4:47:50.920\n that you can pick up along the way.\n\n4:47:50.920 --> 4:47:52.640\n And basically they teach you how to process\n\n4:47:52.640 --> 4:47:54.560\n lots of information very quickly,\n\n4:47:54.560 --> 4:47:57.160\n retain it and then decide what's useful to you\n\n4:47:57.160 --> 4:47:58.360\n for that moment.\n\n4:47:58.360 --> 4:48:00.600\n The second thing is do not undervalue EQ,\n\n4:48:00.600 --> 4:48:01.800\n emotional intelligence.\n\n4:48:01.800 --> 4:48:03.880\n We've lived for a long time in a society\n\n4:48:03.880 --> 4:48:06.040\n where IQ was dominant.\n\n4:48:06.040 --> 4:48:08.920\n It's like how smart you are excuses everything else.\n\n4:48:08.920 --> 4:48:10.640\n You can be a horrible human being,\n\n4:48:10.640 --> 4:48:12.640\n but he's a really bright guy, right?\n\n4:48:12.640 --> 4:48:15.320\n The asshole mathematician or physicist.\n\n4:48:15.320 --> 4:48:17.200\n We now live in a world where the balance\n\n4:48:17.200 --> 4:48:18.600\n is far more important.\n\n4:48:18.600 --> 4:48:21.640\n You have to be smart, but you also have to be a nice guy.\n\n4:48:21.640 --> 4:48:23.000\n And don't undervalue that.\n\n4:48:23.000 --> 4:48:25.080\n So learn things like closed circuit communication\n\n4:48:25.080 --> 4:48:26.480\n and active listening.\n\n4:48:26.480 --> 4:48:30.000\n These skillsets will always pay enormous dividends\n\n4:48:30.000 --> 4:48:31.440\n along the way.\n\n4:48:31.440 --> 4:48:33.320\n Third, remember that you're judged for the things\n\n4:48:33.320 --> 4:48:35.280\n that you have and what you do with those things.\n\n4:48:35.280 --> 4:48:36.720\n You know, if you have very little,\n\n4:48:36.720 --> 4:48:37.840\n you still have to do something.\n\n4:48:37.840 --> 4:48:39.680\n When you have a lot, you have to do even more.\n\n4:48:39.680 --> 4:48:43.240\n So learn how to give and do that early on.\n\n4:48:43.240 --> 4:48:46.000\n Learn how to give back, volunteerism, charity,\n\n4:48:46.000 --> 4:48:48.160\n mentoring, these types of things.\n\n4:48:48.160 --> 4:48:51.320\n Those are so incredibly valuable to a person who's developed.\n\n4:48:51.320 --> 4:48:53.400\n The people that you mentored in the academic world,\n\n4:48:53.400 --> 4:48:55.360\n you learn this, you have graduate students.\n\n4:48:55.360 --> 4:48:58.200\n They one day will be professors.\n\n4:48:58.200 --> 4:49:00.720\n And it might just so happen, they might eclipse you.\n\n4:49:00.720 --> 4:49:03.000\n Remember Gauss had a doctoral advisor.\n\n4:49:04.200 --> 4:49:08.160\n Never forget that, you know, and so did Feynman.\n\n4:49:08.160 --> 4:49:10.440\n Make sure that you mentor people, you give back\n\n4:49:10.440 --> 4:49:12.680\n and you learn how to learn and you learn how to teach.\n\n4:49:12.680 --> 4:49:15.160\n Super important for your development as a person.\n\n4:49:15.160 --> 4:49:17.000\n And you'll notice all those things are agnostic\n\n4:49:17.000 --> 4:49:19.120\n to whatever domain you happen to have chosen.\n\n4:49:19.120 --> 4:49:21.800\n You could be in medicine or law or technology, whatever.\n\n4:49:21.800 --> 4:49:24.680\n That's your fancy, whatever your passion happens to be.\n\n4:49:24.680 --> 4:49:27.800\n And don't conflate your earning in your career.\n\n4:49:27.800 --> 4:49:30.760\n If people try to keep putting these things together,\n\n4:49:30.760 --> 4:49:32.760\n they're increasingly becoming decoupled.\n\n4:49:32.760 --> 4:49:34.840\n There's a lot of cases where people do their passions\n\n4:49:34.840 --> 4:49:37.800\n and they do it for free or, you know, for sustenance,\n\n4:49:37.800 --> 4:49:39.600\n but then they have something else they do on the side\n\n4:49:39.600 --> 4:49:41.840\n to also augment or supplement their income.\n\n4:49:41.840 --> 4:49:43.560\n Probably best that way.\n\n4:49:43.560 --> 4:49:45.440\n When you conflate the two, you tend to get\n\n4:49:45.440 --> 4:49:46.600\n burned out terribly.\n\n4:49:46.600 --> 4:49:49.120\n You see this a lot with musicians or other people.\n\n4:49:49.120 --> 4:49:50.480\n They just, they want to make music,\n\n4:49:50.480 --> 4:49:51.800\n but they have to tour or whatever,\n\n4:49:51.800 --> 4:49:53.280\n because they gotta pay bills.\n\n4:49:53.280 --> 4:49:54.920\n Stuff like that happens.\n\n4:49:54.920 --> 4:49:57.280\n Other than that, I mean, I'm not a guru.\n\n4:49:57.280 --> 4:49:59.200\n I'm not in any particular position to...\n\n4:49:59.200 --> 4:50:01.760\n You showed up in a robe, which I thought was kind of weird.\n\n4:50:01.760 --> 4:50:04.320\n And you had a crown and you kept calling yourself king.\n\n4:50:04.320 --> 4:50:06.400\n King of the rats.\n\n4:50:06.400 --> 4:50:08.360\n And that was in a robe that was a yukata.\n\n4:50:08.360 --> 4:50:10.280\n Okay, thank you for clarifying.\n\n4:50:10.280 --> 4:50:11.600\n Audience, he's joking.\n\n4:50:11.600 --> 4:50:13.120\n I read it.\n\n4:50:15.000 --> 4:50:17.480\n I heard somebody who's gonna write blog posts.\n\n4:50:17.480 --> 4:50:20.000\n Charles Hoskinson walks around with a crown.\n\n4:50:20.840 --> 4:50:23.400\n Let me ask you a ridiculously big\n\n4:50:23.400 --> 4:50:24.800\n and the most important question.\n\n4:50:24.800 --> 4:50:28.080\n What's the meaning of this whole thing, of life?\n\n4:50:28.080 --> 4:50:29.680\n Well, I got a story for that.\n\n4:50:31.560 --> 4:50:33.800\n Does this have something to do with a farm?\n\n4:50:33.800 --> 4:50:35.360\n Well, no, no, no, it's from Japan.\n\n4:50:35.360 --> 4:50:36.200\n I used to live in Japan.\n\n4:50:36.200 --> 4:50:39.640\n I live in Osaka, right next to Namba, beautiful area.\n\n4:50:39.640 --> 4:50:41.280\n It's like, if you're gonna live anywhere in Japan,\n\n4:50:41.280 --> 4:50:42.120\n I live in Osaka.\n\n4:50:42.120 --> 4:50:43.240\n You live anywhere in Osaka,\n\n4:50:43.240 --> 4:50:44.880\n live next to the restaurant district.\n\n4:50:44.880 --> 4:50:47.240\n Four o clock in the morning, you can get good ramen.\n\n4:50:47.240 --> 4:50:50.640\n These are the things in life that make you who you are.\n\n4:50:50.640 --> 4:50:54.360\n So there was a shogun and he was kind of a bad ass.\n\n4:50:54.360 --> 4:50:55.960\n He was really good killing people,\n\n4:50:55.960 --> 4:50:57.360\n really good at running his empire.\n\n4:50:57.360 --> 4:50:59.960\n And then he got a bit disgruntled in his late 40s.\n\n4:50:59.960 --> 4:51:03.080\n And he said, you know, I'm just gonna give it all to my son\n\n4:51:03.080 --> 4:51:04.880\n and I'm gonna wander around Japan\n\n4:51:04.880 --> 4:51:07.200\n until I find the perfect cherry blossom.\n\n4:51:07.200 --> 4:51:08.520\n That's what I'm gonna do.\n\n4:51:08.520 --> 4:51:09.800\n Everybody thought he went crazy.\n\n4:51:09.800 --> 4:51:11.120\n He said, no, no, no, that's what I'm gonna do.\n\n4:51:11.120 --> 4:51:12.600\n And he took his whole entourage with him.\n\n4:51:12.600 --> 4:51:14.720\n And so his son is now the shogun.\n\n4:51:14.720 --> 4:51:16.680\n And then he's just wandering throughout Japan\n\n4:51:16.680 --> 4:51:19.000\n and having all these incredible crazy adventures\n\n4:51:19.000 --> 4:51:20.480\n as he's wandering throughout Japan,\n\n4:51:20.480 --> 4:51:24.280\n fighting bandits and loving beautiful women and so forth.\n\n4:51:24.280 --> 4:51:28.880\n And then 30 years later, he's passing these two geisha gals\n\n4:51:28.880 --> 4:51:31.080\n and one of them turns around\n\n4:51:31.080 --> 4:51:33.960\n and they notice him slumped over next to a cherry tree.\n\n4:51:33.960 --> 4:51:37.760\n And so she goes over to try to rouse him and he's dead.\n\n4:51:37.760 --> 4:51:41.480\n And in his hands is a wilted cherry blossom.\n\n4:51:41.480 --> 4:51:43.880\n So that's a very Japanese story, right?\n\n4:51:43.880 --> 4:51:47.440\n The point is that it's not the actual blossom\n\n4:51:47.440 --> 4:51:49.360\n finding the perfection that matters.\n\n4:51:49.360 --> 4:51:52.000\n It's the things you do on a day to day basis.\n\n4:51:52.000 --> 4:51:53.560\n The places you go, the people you meet,\n\n4:51:53.560 --> 4:51:55.720\n the experiences you have and the joy you take\n\n4:51:55.720 --> 4:51:58.480\n in the things that you do here in the moment now.\n\n4:51:58.480 --> 4:51:59.840\n You have to get there.\n\n4:51:59.840 --> 4:52:02.040\n You know, if you look at Jiro dreams of sushi,\n\n4:52:02.040 --> 4:52:03.880\n there's this guy 70 years of his life\n\n4:52:03.880 --> 4:52:05.600\n making the same damn piece of sushi\n\n4:52:05.600 --> 4:52:06.800\n again and again and again.\n\n4:52:06.800 --> 4:52:08.600\n He's the happiest guy around.\n\n4:52:08.600 --> 4:52:11.160\n Albert Camus and his story of Sisyphus.\n\n4:52:11.160 --> 4:52:12.760\n You know, Sisyphus should be miserable.\n\n4:52:12.760 --> 4:52:13.680\n It's the Greek curse.\n\n4:52:13.680 --> 4:52:15.040\n No, he's happy.\n\n4:52:15.040 --> 4:52:17.120\n He has total clarity of purpose.\n\n4:52:17.120 --> 4:52:19.800\n And every day he gets to basically roll that stone\n\n4:52:19.800 --> 4:52:21.680\n just a little bit better than the day before,\n\n4:52:21.680 --> 4:52:23.640\n a different way than the day before.\n\n4:52:23.640 --> 4:52:25.600\n And it's not the destination.\n\n4:52:25.600 --> 4:52:26.920\n It isn't getting the stone up\n\n4:52:26.920 --> 4:52:28.680\n to the top of the hill that matters.\n\n4:52:28.680 --> 4:52:30.360\n It's the fact that the act,\n\n4:52:30.360 --> 4:52:32.480\n you find that joy in that act, that ikigai,\n\n4:52:32.480 --> 4:52:35.160\n that way of life, that purpose of life.\n\n4:52:35.160 --> 4:52:37.080\n That I think is the closest thing\n\n4:52:37.080 --> 4:52:38.960\n a human can get to a meaning.\n\n4:52:39.960 --> 4:52:40.920\n You're a blip.\n\n4:52:40.920 --> 4:52:44.840\n You know, you didn't exist, you're dead.\n\n4:52:44.840 --> 4:52:47.800\n And if you compare it to the size of the universe\n\n4:52:47.800 --> 4:52:49.680\n in that time, it's just a little blip.\n\n4:52:49.680 --> 4:52:51.840\n So all you can do with what you have\n\n4:52:51.840 --> 4:52:53.240\n is just find meaning in the things\n\n4:52:53.240 --> 4:52:54.600\n that you do on a daily basis.\n\n4:52:54.600 --> 4:52:56.440\n And you can't predict the macro.\n\n4:52:56.440 --> 4:52:58.360\n We have all this wealth and power in America.\n\n4:52:58.360 --> 4:52:59.960\n What if a world war breaks out?\n\n4:52:59.960 --> 4:53:02.720\n We could be destitute like Walmart Germany.\n\n4:53:02.720 --> 4:53:04.720\n And so, you know, you could be a big guy.\n\n4:53:04.720 --> 4:53:07.120\n You could be now living on the street side.\n\n4:53:07.120 --> 4:53:08.520\n Would you be miserable?\n\n4:53:08.520 --> 4:53:10.240\n The point of life is getting to a point\n\n4:53:10.240 --> 4:53:11.720\n that no matter what comes your way,\n\n4:53:11.720 --> 4:53:13.720\n what misfortune comes your way,\n\n4:53:13.720 --> 4:53:15.480\n you're in a position where you can find\n\n4:53:15.480 --> 4:53:18.920\n a modicum of happiness and love and empathy\n\n4:53:18.920 --> 4:53:21.480\n for others in that moment.\n\n4:53:21.480 --> 4:53:23.160\n And then the highest pursuit of life\n\n4:53:23.160 --> 4:53:25.920\n is the ability to share that mindset with other people\n\n4:53:25.920 --> 4:53:27.760\n and give it to them somehow.\n\n4:53:27.760 --> 4:53:29.560\n And that's really hard, you know,\n\n4:53:29.560 --> 4:53:31.560\n because everybody comes in, they're always Eeyore,\n\n4:53:31.560 --> 4:53:33.040\n oh, doom and gloom and cynical,\n\n4:53:33.040 --> 4:53:35.560\n and but this and that and reputation this and that.\n\n4:53:35.560 --> 4:53:37.280\n You have to somehow transcend all of it and say,\n\n4:53:37.280 --> 4:53:38.800\n you know, that doesn't matter.\n\n4:53:38.800 --> 4:53:40.160\n Look at the cherry blossoms.\n\n4:53:40.160 --> 4:53:41.440\n Aren't they beautiful today?\n\n4:53:41.440 --> 4:53:43.280\n And let's find a better one tomorrow.\n\n4:53:44.520 --> 4:53:48.400\n See, you're also a fan of fishing, I read somewhere.\n\n4:53:48.400 --> 4:53:51.000\n And one of my favorite books is Old Man and the Sea,\n\n4:53:52.320 --> 4:53:57.320\n where there's an old man sort of battling a big fish\n\n4:53:58.360 --> 4:54:01.480\n and basically closing out the last chapter of his life\n\n4:54:01.480 --> 4:54:02.880\n in this battle.\n\n4:54:02.880 --> 4:54:06.080\n So I think another aspect of life with this boulder,\n\n4:54:06.080 --> 4:54:07.960\n it feels like the boulder gets bigger and bigger\n\n4:54:07.960 --> 4:54:10.960\n as we get closer to death.\n\n4:54:10.960 --> 4:54:13.800\n And, you know, you find yourself married\n\n4:54:13.800 --> 4:54:17.640\n to a particular struggle in life\n\n4:54:17.640 --> 4:54:20.800\n that eventually just kind of overtakes\n\n4:54:20.800 --> 4:54:23.640\n the entirety of meaning of your existence.\n\n4:54:23.640 --> 4:54:26.240\n Do you think, I know what it is for me.\n\n4:54:26.240 --> 4:54:28.520\n Do you have something like that?\n\n4:54:28.520 --> 4:54:32.480\n The broader vision that unites your work with Cardano\n\n4:54:32.480 --> 4:54:34.240\n and everything you've done in life,\n\n4:54:34.240 --> 4:54:37.480\n the big fish that you're going to end up\n\n4:54:37.480 --> 4:54:38.960\n in the dark of night,\n\n4:54:38.960 --> 4:54:42.240\n struggling with the last chapter of your life,\n\n4:54:42.240 --> 4:54:44.080\n like the big problem you're taking on?\n\n4:54:45.720 --> 4:54:48.040\n Well, in mathematics, it was the Goldbach conjecture.\n\n4:54:48.040 --> 4:54:49.040\n I'd like to prove that.\n\n4:54:49.040 --> 4:54:51.320\n That's probably not gonna work.\n\n4:54:51.320 --> 4:54:53.240\n That's a really big fish.\n\n4:54:53.240 --> 4:54:54.920\n So do you still have a love for mathematics?\n\n4:54:54.920 --> 4:54:57.040\n Oh God, yeah, of course I do.\n\n4:54:57.040 --> 4:54:58.040\n You never lose that.\n\n4:54:58.040 --> 4:54:58.880\n You never lose that.\n\n4:54:58.880 --> 4:55:00.880\n You lose the ability to do deep work\n\n4:55:00.880 --> 4:55:02.400\n and you don't have the creativity\n\n4:55:02.400 --> 4:55:04.080\n and the raw inspiration.\n\n4:55:04.080 --> 4:55:06.040\n This is why I've gotten to automated theorem proving\n\n4:55:06.040 --> 4:55:08.600\n because what I lack and because I'm getting older,\n\n4:55:08.600 --> 4:55:10.120\n I can now have computers understand it\n\n4:55:10.120 --> 4:55:11.820\n and use AI to just solve this stuff.\n\n4:55:11.820 --> 4:55:13.960\n It's like the cheat codes for math.\n\n4:55:13.960 --> 4:55:16.520\n Fuck those guys, we'll still do that.\n\n4:55:16.520 --> 4:55:19.080\n But you know, mathematics still has those last passions\n\n4:55:19.080 --> 4:55:20.800\n and there's all kinds of cool things\n\n4:55:20.800 --> 4:55:22.280\n that I'd like to see done.\n\n4:55:22.280 --> 4:55:24.880\n Like quota complexes allow you to unify topology\n\n4:55:24.880 --> 4:55:26.600\n and number theory in really novel ways.\n\n4:55:26.600 --> 4:55:29.100\n And there are all kinds of cool things, but who cares?\n\n4:55:29.100 --> 4:55:34.100\n Everybody has those white whales.\n\n4:55:34.400 --> 4:55:37.200\n Another thing I love to do is bring back the woolly mammoth.\n\n4:55:37.200 --> 4:55:39.240\n That's George Church's hidden pleasure.\n\n4:55:39.240 --> 4:55:41.200\n In five to 10 years, it's actually gonna happen.\n\n4:55:41.200 --> 4:55:42.760\n And I have this beautiful ranch in Wyoming\n\n4:55:42.760 --> 4:55:44.440\n and I gotta find a way to convince George\n\n4:55:44.440 --> 4:55:47.480\n to let me raise his clone mammoth fence on my ranch.\n\n4:55:47.480 --> 4:55:48.400\n Among the bison.\n\n4:55:48.400 --> 4:55:49.240\n Among the bison.\n\n4:55:49.240 --> 4:55:50.800\n They'd probably get along really well.\n\n4:55:50.800 --> 4:55:52.440\n And then I have to learn all these cool things\n\n4:55:52.440 --> 4:55:53.360\n about woolly mammoths.\n\n4:55:53.360 --> 4:55:55.440\n Like do you shave them in the summertime\n\n4:55:55.440 --> 4:55:56.880\n and let them get shaggy during the winter\n\n4:55:56.880 --> 4:55:58.720\n or do you just let that coat go and then it falls?\n\n4:55:58.720 --> 4:56:00.320\n Who knows?\n\n4:56:00.320 --> 4:56:02.040\n It's an undiscovered country.\n\n4:56:02.040 --> 4:56:05.000\n I just had the image of Charles Hoskinson alone\n\n4:56:05.000 --> 4:56:09.600\n on a bison farm trying to raise a woolly mammoth.\n\n4:56:09.600 --> 4:56:10.800\n Just start wearing a white suit\n\n4:56:10.800 --> 4:56:13.080\n and say welcome to Hoskinson's ranch.\n\n4:56:13.080 --> 4:56:14.640\n I'll have a cane with amber on it.\n\n4:56:14.640 --> 4:56:17.140\n Yeah, with a chalkboard that you keep scrambling on\n\n4:56:17.140 --> 4:56:20.040\n like the beautiful mind in the movie\n\n4:56:20.040 --> 4:56:20.920\n and you'll have voices.\n\n4:56:20.920 --> 4:56:22.480\n All the schizophrenia's already come.\n\n4:56:22.480 --> 4:56:25.440\n You guys are all figments of my imagination anyway.\n\n4:56:25.440 --> 4:56:27.960\n Now one of my goals though, I love catfish\n\n4:56:27.960 --> 4:56:28.920\n and they live a long time.\n\n4:56:28.920 --> 4:56:31.000\n They get really damn big if you see those guys.\n\n4:56:31.000 --> 4:56:33.560\n I'd love to catch one now and be in my 60s\n\n4:56:33.560 --> 4:56:36.560\n and catch the same fish twice and recognize it.\n\n4:56:36.560 --> 4:56:38.200\n Maybe I'll lift a scar or something.\n\n4:56:38.200 --> 4:56:41.080\n That'd be really cool, going back to the fish thing.\n\n4:56:41.080 --> 4:56:42.880\n Because both the fish has gone through a lot,\n\n4:56:42.880 --> 4:56:43.840\n I've gone through a lot.\n\n4:56:43.840 --> 4:56:44.680\n We can just be like old friends.\n\n4:56:44.680 --> 4:56:45.520\n Reminisce.\n\n4:56:45.520 --> 4:56:47.340\n Exactly,
