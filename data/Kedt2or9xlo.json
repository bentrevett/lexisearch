--> 00:09.120\n and before that, he was at Google Brain and Berkeley.\n\n00:09.120 --> 00:13.280\n His research has been cited over 39,000 times.\n\n00:13.280 --> 00:16.520\n He's truly one of the most brilliant and impactful minds\n\n00:16.520 --> 00:18.160\n in the field of deep learning.\n\n00:18.160 --> 00:20.960\n He's behind some of the biggest papers and ideas in AI,\n\n00:20.960 --> 00:23.080\n including sequence to sequence learning,\n\n00:23.080 --> 00:25.480\n audio generation, image captioning,\n\n00:25.480 --> 00:27.000\n neural machine translation,\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:29.600\n and, of course, reinforcement learning.\n\n00:29.600 --> 00:32.800\n He's a lead researcher of the AlphaStar project,\n\n00:32.800 --> 00:35.760\n creating an agent that defeated a top professional\n\n00:35.760 --> 00:38.080\n at the game of StarCraft.\n\n00:38.080 --> 00:39.800\n This conversation is part\n\n00:39.800 --> 00:41.800\n of the Artificial Intelligence podcast.\n\n00:41.800 --> 00:44.920\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,\n\n00:44.920 --> 00:48.800\n or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman,\n\n00:48.800 --> 00:51.240\n spelled F R I D.\n\n00:51.240 --> 00:55.440\n And now, here's my conversation with Ariel Vinales.\n\n00:55.440 --> 00:59.600\n You spearheaded the DeepMind team behind AlphaStar\n\n00:59.600 --> 01:02.840\n that recently beat a top professional player at StarCraft.\n\n01:04.040 --> 01:07.720\n So you have an incredible wealth of work\n\n01:07.720 --> 01:09.480\n in deep learning and a bunch of fields,\n\n01:09.480 --> 01:11.840\n but let's talk about StarCraft first.\n\n01:11.840 --> 01:13.760\n Let's go back to the very beginning,\n\n01:13.760 --> 01:16.680\n even before AlphaStar, before DeepMind,\n\n01:16.680 --> 01:18.840\n before deep learning first.\n\n01:18.840 --> 01:21.280\n What came first for you,\n\n01:21.280 --> 01:24.960\n a love for programming or a love for video games?\n\n01:24.960 --> 01:28.560\n I think for me, it definitely came first\n\n01:28.560 --> 01:31.960\n the drive to play video games.\n\n01:31.960 --> 01:35.280\n I really liked computers.\n\n01:35.280 --> 01:38.840\n I didn't really code much, but what I would do is\n\n01:38.840 --> 01:42.080\n I would just mess with the computer, break it and fix it.\n\n01:42.080 --> 01:43.800\n That was the level of skills, I guess,\n\n01:43.800 --> 01:46.400\n that I gained in my very early days,\n\n01:46.400 --> 01:48.520\n I mean, when I was 10 or 11.\n\n01:48.520 --> 01:50.960\n And then I really got into video games,\n\n01:50.960 --> 01:53.680\n especially StarCraft, actually, the first version.\n\n01:53.680 --> 01:55.240\n I spent most of my time\n\n01:55.240 --> 01:57.080\n just playing kind of pseudo professionally,\n\n01:57.080 --> 02:01.040\n as professionally as you could play back in 98 in Europe,\n\n02:01.040 --> 02:03.080\n which was not a very main scene\n\n02:03.080 --> 02:05.840\n like what's called nowadays eSports.\n\n02:05.840 --> 02:07.400\n Right, of course, in the 90s.\n\n02:07.400 --> 02:09.920\n So how'd you get into StarCraft?\n\n02:09.920 --> 02:11.680\n What was your favorite race?\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:15.080\n How did you develop your skill?\n\n02:15.080 --> 02:16.880\n What was your strategy?\n\n02:16.880 --> 02:18.040\n All that kind of thing.\n\n02:18.040 --> 02:21.520\n So as a player, I tended to try to play not many games,\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:23.720\n not to kind of disclose the strategies\n\n02:23.720 --> 02:25.400\n that I kind of developed.\n\n02:25.400 --> 02:27.560\n And I like to play random, actually,\n\n02:27.560 --> 02:30.040\n not in competitions, but just to...\n\n02:30.040 --> 02:33.400\n I think in StarCraft, there's three main races\n\n02:33.400 --> 02:36.280\n and I found it very useful to play with all of them.\n\n02:36.280 --> 02:38.360\n And so I would choose random many times,\n\n02:38.360 --> 02:40.200\n even sometimes in tournaments,\n\n02:40.200 --> 02:42.360\n to gain skill on the three races\n\n02:42.360 --> 02:45.440\n because it's not how you play against someone,\n\n02:45.440 --> 02:48.760\n but also if you understand the race because you played,\n\n02:48.760 --> 02:51.040\n you also understand what's annoying,\n\n02:51.040 --> 02:52.480\n then when you're on the other side,\n\n02:52.480 --> 02:54.160\n what to do to annoy that person,\n\n02:54.160 --> 02:57.280\n to try to gain advantages here and there and so on.\n\n02:57.280 --> 02:59.080\n So I actually played random,\n\n02:59.080 --> 03:02.000\n although I must say in terms of favorite race,\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:03.640\n I really liked Zerg.\n\n03:03.640 --> 03:05.480\n I was probably best at Zerg\n\n03:05.480 --> 03:08.320\n and that's probably what I tend to use\n\n03:08.320 --> 03:11.400\n towards the end of my career before starting university.\n\n03:11.400 --> 03:13.280\n So let's step back a little bit.\n\n03:13.280 --> 03:15.600\n Could you try to describe StarCraft\n\n03:15.600 --> 03:18.880\n to people that may never have played video games,\n\n03:18.880 --> 03:22.280\n especially the massively online variety like StarCraft?\n\n03:22.280 --> 03:25.880\n So StarCraft is a real time strategy game.\n\n03:25.880 --> 03:27.760\n And the way to think about StarCraft,\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:30.920\n perhaps if you understand a bit chess,\n\n03:30.920 --> 03:34.200\n is that there's a board which is called map\n\n03:34.200 --> 03:39.120\n or the map where people play against each other.\n\n03:39.120 --> 03:40.960\n There's obviously many ways you can play,\n\n03:40.960 --> 03:44.600\n but the most interesting one is the one versus one setup\n\n03:44.600 --> 03:47.360\n where you just play against someone else\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:49.280\n or even the built in AI, right?\n\n03:49.280 --> 03:51.600\n Blizzard put a system that can play the game\n\n03:51.600 --> 03:54.480\n reasonably well if you don't know how to play.\n\n03:54.480 --> 03:57.080\n And then in this board, you have again,\n\n03:57.080 --> 03:58.680\n pieces like in chess,\n\n03:58.680 --> 04:01.400\n but these pieces are not there initially\n\n04:01.400 --> 04:02.360\n like they are in chess.\n\n04:02.360 --> 04:05.800\n You actually need to decide to gather resources\n\n04:05.800 --> 04:07.920\n to decide which pieces to build.\n\n04:07.920 --> 04:10.760\n So in a way you're starting almost with no pieces.\n\n04:10.760 --> 04:13.400\n You start gathering resources in StarCraft.\n\n04:13.400 --> 04:16.200\n There's minerals and gas that you can gather.\n\n04:16.200 --> 04:19.440\n And then you must decide how much do you wanna focus\n\n04:19.440 --> 04:21.480\n for instance, on gathering more resources\n\n04:21.480 --> 04:24.360\n or starting to build units or pieces.\n\n04:24.360 --> 04:27.200\n And then once you have enough pieces\n\n04:27.200 --> 04:32.120\n or maybe like attack, a good attack composition,\n\n04:32.120 --> 04:35.480\n then you go and attack the other side of the map.\n\n04:35.480 --> 04:37.800\n And now the other main difference with chess\n\n04:37.800 --> 04:39.920\n is that you don't see the other side of the map.\n\n04:39.920 --> 04:43.360\n So you're not seeing the moves of the enemy.\n\n04:43.360 --> 04:45.440\n It's what we call partially observable.\n\n04:45.440 --> 04:48.680\n So as a result, you must not only decide\n\n04:48.680 --> 04:52.320\n trading off economy versus building your own units,\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:54.960\n but you also must decide whether you wanna scout\n\n04:54.960 --> 04:57.840\n to gather information, but also by scouting,\n\n04:57.840 --> 04:59.520\n you might be giving away some information\n\n04:59.520 --> 05:01.960\n that you might be hiding from the enemy.\n\n05:01.960 --> 05:04.960\n So there's a lot of complex decision making\n\n05:04.960 --> 05:06.000\n all in real time.\n\n05:06.000 --> 05:10.120\n There's also unlike chess, this is not a turn based game.\n\n05:10.120 --> 05:13.680\n You play basically all the time continuously\n\n05:13.680 --> 05:16.280\n and thus some skill in terms of speed\n\n05:16.280 --> 05:18.920\n and accuracy of clicking is also very important.\n\n05:18.920 --> 05:21.480\n And people that train for this really play this game\n\n05:21.480 --> 05:23.560\n at an amazing skill level.\n\n05:23.560 --> 05:25.800\n I've seen many times these\n\n05:25.800 --> 05:27.360\n and if you can witness this life,\n\n05:27.360 --> 05:29.480\n it's really, really impressive.\n\n05:29.480 --> 05:31.400\n So in a way, it's kind of a chess\n\n05:31.400 --> 05:33.400\n where you don't see the other side of the board,\n\n05:33.400 --> 05:35.200\n you're building your own pieces\n\n05:35.200 --> 05:37.200\n and you also need to gather resources\n\n05:37.200 --> 05:40.680\n to basically get some money to build other buildings,\n\n05:40.680 --> 05:42.840\n pieces, technology and so on.\n\n05:42.840 --> 05:45.120\n From the perspective of a human player,\n\n05:45.120 --> 05:47.200\n the difference between that and chess\n\n05:47.200 --> 05:50.760\n or maybe that and a game like turn based strategy\n\n05:50.760 --> 05:55.160\n like Heroes of Might and Magic is that there's an anxiety\n\n05:55.160 --> 05:58.760\n because you have to make these decisions really quickly.\n\n05:58.760 --> 06:03.760\n And if you are not actually aware of what decisions work,\n\n06:04.360 --> 06:06.480\n it's a very stressful balance.\n\n06:06.480 --> 06:08.880\n Everything you describe is actually quite stressful,\n\n06:08.880 --> 06:11.680\n difficult to balance for an amateur human player.\n\n06:11.680 --> 06:14.120\n I don't know if it gets easier at the professional level,\n\n06:14.120 --> 06:16.440\n like if they're fully aware of what they have to do,\n\n06:16.440 --> 06:19.240\n but at the amateur level, there's this anxiety.\n\n06:19.240 --> 06:20.440\n Oh crap, I'm being attacked.\n\n06:20.440 --> 06:22.760\n Oh crap, I have to build up resource.\n\n06:22.760 --> 06:24.320\n Oh, I have to probably expand.\n\n06:24.320 --> 06:26.120\n And all these, the time,\n\n06:26.120 --> 06:29.440\n the real time strategy aspect is really stressful\n\n06:29.440 --> 06:31.320\n and computationally I'm sure difficult.\n\n06:31.320 --> 06:32.240\n We'll get into it.\n\n06:32.240 --> 06:35.960\n But for me, Battle.net,\n\n06:35.960 --> 06:40.960\n so StarCraft was released in 98, 20 years ago,\n\n06:42.600 --> 06:44.640\n which is hard to believe.\n\n06:44.640 --> 06:49.640\n And Blizzard Battle.net with Diablo in 96 came out.\n\n06:50.160 --> 06:52.560\n And to me, it might be a narrow perspective,\n\n06:52.560 --> 06:56.800\n but it changed online gaming and perhaps society forever.\n\n06:56.800 --> 06:57.640\n Yeah.\n\n06:57.640 --> 07:00.280\n But I may have made way too narrow viewpoint,\n\n07:00.280 --> 07:02.200\n but from your perspective,\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:05.040\n can you talk about the history of gaming\n\n07:05.040 --> 07:06.440\n over the past 20 years?\n\n07:06.440 --> 07:09.120\n Is this, how transformational,\n\n07:09.120 --> 07:12.200\n how important is this line of games?\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:16.400\n Right, so I think I kind of was an active gamer\n\n07:16.400 --> 07:20.040\n whilst this was developing, the internet, online gaming.\n\n07:20.040 --> 07:24.800\n So for me, the way it came was I played other games,\n\n07:24.800 --> 07:27.880\n strategy related, I played a bit of Common and Conquer,\n\n07:27.880 --> 07:31.320\n and then I played Warcraft II, which is from Blizzard.\n\n07:31.320 --> 07:32.520\n But at the time, I didn't know,\n\n07:32.520 --> 07:35.520\n I didn't understand about what Blizzard was or anything.\n\n07:35.520 --> 07:36.800\n Warcraft II was just a game,\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:39.760\n which was actually very similar to StarCraft in many ways.\n\n07:39.760 --> 07:41.960\n It's also real time strategy game\n\n07:41.960 --> 07:44.880\n where there's orcs and humans, so there's only two races.\n\n07:44.880 --> 07:46.000\n But it was offline.\n\n07:46.000 --> 07:47.480\n And it was offline, right?\n\n07:47.480 --> 07:51.120\n So I remember a friend of mine came to school,\n\n07:51.120 --> 07:53.480\n say, oh, there's this new cool game called StarCraft.\n\n07:53.480 --> 07:54.920\n And I just said, oh, this sounds like\n\n07:54.920 --> 07:59.240\n just a copy of Warcraft II, until I kind of installed it.\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:01.520\n And at the time, I am from Spain,\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:04.160\n so we didn't have very good internet, right?\n\n08:04.160 --> 08:05.720\n So there was, for us,\n\n08:05.720 --> 08:09.080\n StarCraft became first kind of an offline experience\n\n08:09.080 --> 08:12.480\n where you kind of start to play these missions, right?\n\n08:12.480 --> 08:15.280\n You play against some sort of scripted things\n\n08:15.280 --> 08:18.520\n to develop the story of the characters in the game.\n\n08:18.520 --> 08:23.040\n And then later on, I start playing against the built in AI,\n\n08:23.040 --> 08:25.680\n and I thought it was impossible to defeat it.\n\n08:25.680 --> 08:27.000\n Then eventually you defeat one\n\n08:27.000 --> 08:29.240\n and you can actually play against seven built in AIs\n\n08:29.240 --> 08:32.240\n at the same time, which also felt impossible.\n\n08:32.240 --> 08:34.840\n But actually, it's not that hard to beat\n\n08:34.840 --> 08:36.520\n seven built in AIs at once.\n\n08:36.520 --> 08:40.120\n So once we achieved that, also we discovered that\n\n08:40.120 --> 08:43.400\n we could play, as I said, internet wasn't that great,\n\n08:43.400 --> 08:45.480\n but we could play with the LAN, right?\n\n08:45.480 --> 08:47.600\n Like basically against each other\n\n08:47.600 --> 08:49.480\n if we were in the same place\n\n08:49.480 --> 08:51.880\n because you could just connect machines with like cables,\n\n08:51.880 --> 08:53.200\n right?\n\n08:53.200 --> 08:55.480\n So we started playing in LAN mode\n\n08:55.480 --> 08:58.080\n and as a group of friends,\n\n08:58.080 --> 09:00.520\n and it was really, really like much more entertaining\n\n09:00.520 --> 09:02.280\n than playing against AIs.\n\n09:02.280 --> 09:05.120\n And later on, as internet was starting to develop\n\n09:05.120 --> 09:07.400\n and being a bit faster and more reliable,\n\n09:07.400 --> 09:09.720\n then it's when I started experiencing Battle.net,\n\n09:09.720 --> 09:11.560\n which is this amazing universe,\n\n09:11.560 --> 09:13.720\n not only because of the fact\n\n09:13.720 --> 09:16.440\n that you can play the game against anyone in the world,\n\n09:16.440 --> 09:20.200\n but you can also get to know more people.\n\n09:20.200 --> 09:23.080\n You just get exposed to now like this vast variety of,\n\n09:23.080 --> 09:25.320\n it's kind of a bit when the chats came about, right?\n\n09:25.320 --> 09:27.320\n There was a chat system.\n\n09:27.320 --> 09:29.040\n You could play against people,\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:30.720\n but you could also chat with people,\n\n09:30.720 --> 09:32.480\n not only about Stalker, but about anything.\n\n09:32.480 --> 09:36.640\n And that became a way of life for kind of two years.\n\n09:36.640 --> 09:38.880\n And obviously then it became like kind of,\n\n09:38.880 --> 09:42.240\n it exploded in me in that I started to play more seriously,\n\n09:42.240 --> 09:44.680\n going to tournaments and so on and so forth.\n\n09:44.680 --> 09:49.680\n Do you have a sense on a societal, sociological level,\n\n09:49.840 --> 09:52.240\n what's this whole part of society\n\n09:52.240 --> 09:53.800\n that many of us are not aware of\n\n09:53.800 --> 09:56.840\n and it's a huge part of society, which is gamers.\n\n09:56.840 --> 10:00.920\n I mean, every time I come across that in YouTube\n\n10:00.920 --> 10:03.160\n or streaming sites, I mean,\n\n10:03.160 --> 10:07.600\n this is the huge number of people play games religiously.\n\n10:07.600 --> 10:08.880\n Do you have a sense of those folks,\n\n10:08.880 --> 10:10.840\n especially now that you've returned to that realm\n\n10:10.840 --> 10:12.600\n a little bit on the AI side?\n\n10:12.600 --> 10:15.880\n Yeah, so in fact, even after Stalker,\n\n10:15.880 --> 10:17.600\n I actually played World of Warcraft,\n\n10:17.600 --> 10:21.360\n which is maybe the main sort of online worlds\n\n10:21.360 --> 10:23.880\n or in presence that you get to interact\n\n10:23.880 --> 10:24.720\n with lots of people.\n\n10:24.720 --> 10:26.320\n So I played that for a little bit.\n\n10:26.320 --> 10:29.000\n It was to me, it was a bit less stressful than StarCraft\n\n10:29.000 --> 10:30.840\n because winning was kind of a given.\n\n10:30.840 --> 10:32.320\n You just put in this world\n\n10:32.320 --> 10:34.960\n and you can always complete missions.\n\n10:34.960 --> 10:38.040\n But I think it was actually the social aspect\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:40.400\n of especially StarCraft first\n\n10:40.400 --> 10:43.360\n and then games like World of Warcraft\n\n10:43.360 --> 10:46.880\n really shaped me in a very interesting ways\n\n10:46.880 --> 10:48.480\n because what you get to experience\n\n10:48.480 --> 10:51.600\n is just people you wouldn't usually interact with, right?\n\n10:51.600 --> 10:54.920\n So even nowadays, I still have many Facebook friends\n\n10:54.920 --> 10:56.880\n from the area where I played online\n\n10:56.880 --> 11:00.040\n and their ways of thinking is even political.\n\n11:00.040 --> 11:01.560\n They just, we don't live in,\n\n11:01.560 --> 11:03.640\n like we don't interact in the real world,\n\n11:03.640 --> 11:06.680\n but we were connected by basically fiber.\n\n11:06.680 --> 11:10.760\n And that way I actually get to understand a bit better\n\n11:10.760 --> 11:12.760\n that we live in a diverse world.\n\n11:12.760 --> 11:15.560\n And these were just connections that were made by,\n\n11:15.560 --> 11:18.040\n because, you know, I happened to go in a city\n\n11:18.040 --> 11:22.400\n in a virtual city as a priest and I met this warrior\n\n11:22.400 --> 11:23.600\n and we became friends\n\n11:23.600 --> 11:25.640\n and then we start like playing together, right?\n\n11:25.640 --> 11:28.720\n So I think it's transformative\n\n11:28.720 --> 11:31.240\n and more and more and more people are more aware of it.\n\n11:31.240 --> 11:33.440\n I mean, it's becoming quite mainstream,\n\n11:33.440 --> 11:37.560\n but back in the day, as you were saying in 2000, 2005,\n\n11:37.560 --> 11:42.040\n even it was very, still very strange thing to do,\n\n11:42.040 --> 11:44.200\n especially in Europe.\n\n11:44.200 --> 11:47.080\n I think there were exceptions like Korea, for instance,\n\n11:47.080 --> 11:50.560\n it was amazing that everything happened so early\n\n11:50.560 --> 11:54.400\n in terms of cybercafes, like if you go to Seoul,\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:57.040\n it's a city that back in the day,\n\n11:57.040 --> 11:58.360\n StarCraft was kind of,\n\n11:58.360 --> 12:00.600\n you could be a celebrity by playing StarCraft,\n\n12:00.600 --> 12:03.000\n but this was like 99, 2000, right?\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:04.120\n It's not like recently.\n\n12:04.120 --> 12:08.520\n So yeah, it's quite interesting to look back\n\n12:08.520 --> 12:10.920\n and yeah, I think it's changing society.\n\n12:10.920 --> 12:13.080\n The same way, of course, like technology\n\n12:13.080 --> 12:16.880\n and social networks and so on are also transforming things.\n\n12:16.880 --> 12:18.440\n And a quick tangent, let me ask,\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:20.960\n you're also one of the most productive people\n\n12:20.960 --> 12:25.960\n in your particular chosen passion and path in life.\n\n12:26.400 --> 12:29.440\n And yet you're also appreciate and enjoy video games.\n\n12:29.440 --> 12:31.040\n Do you think it's possible to do,\n\n12:32.680 --> 12:35.760\n to enjoy video games in moderation?\n\n12:35.760 --> 12:39.880\n Someone told me that you could choose two out of three.\n\n12:39.880 --> 12:41.120\n When I was playing video games,\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:43.680\n you could choose having a girlfriend,\n\n12:43.680 --> 12:46.200\n playing video games or studying.\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:50.520\n And I think for the most part, it was relatively true.\n\n12:50.520 --> 12:52.320\n These things do take time.\n\n12:52.320 --> 12:53.320\n Games like StarCraft,\n\n12:53.320 --> 12:55.360\n if you take the game pretty seriously\n\n12:55.360 --> 12:56.480\n and you wanna study it,\n\n12:56.480 --> 12:59.040\n then you obviously will dedicate more time to it.\n\n12:59.040 --> 13:01.160\n And I definitely took gaming\n\n13:01.160 --> 13:03.640\n and obviously studying very seriously.\n\n13:03.640 --> 13:08.640\n I love learning science and et cetera.\n\n13:08.680 --> 13:13.080\n So to me, especially when I started university undergrad,\n\n13:13.080 --> 13:14.880\n I kind of step off StarCraft.\n\n13:14.880 --> 13:16.800\n I actually fully stopped playing.\n\n13:16.800 --> 13:19.000\n And then World of Warcraft was a bit more casual.\n\n13:19.000 --> 13:20.400\n You could just connect online.\n\n13:20.400 --> 13:22.880\n And I mean, it was fun.\n\n13:22.880 --> 13:26.800\n But as I said, that was not as much time investment\n\n13:26.800 --> 13:29.440\n as it was for me in StarCraft.\n\n13:29.440 --> 13:31.600\n Okay, so let's get into AlphaStar.\n\n13:31.600 --> 13:35.160\n What are the, you're behind the team.\n\n13:35.160 --> 13:37.200\n So DeepMind has been working on StarCraft\n\n13:37.200 --> 13:39.360\n and released a bunch of cool open source agents\n\n13:39.360 --> 13:41.280\n and so on the past few years.\n\n13:41.280 --> 13:43.160\n But AlphaStar really is the moment\n\n13:43.160 --> 13:48.160\n where the first time you beat a world class player.\n\n13:49.120 --> 13:51.560\n So what are the parameters of the challenge\n\n13:51.560 --> 13:53.440\n in the way that AlphaStar took it on\n\n13:53.440 --> 13:55.240\n and how did you and David\n\n13:55.240 --> 13:58.240\n and the rest of the DeepMind team get into it?\n\n13:58.240 --> 14:00.920\n Consider that you can even beat the best in the world\n\n14:00.920 --> 14:02.440\n or top players.\n\n14:02.440 --> 14:05.440\n I think it all started back in 2015.\n\n14:08.040 --> 14:08.880\n Actually, I'm lying.\n\n14:08.880 --> 14:13.880\n I think it was 2014 when DeepMind was acquired by Google.\n\n14:14.000 --> 14:15.680\n And I at the time was at Google Brain,\n\n14:15.680 --> 14:18.880\n which was in California, is still in California.\n\n14:18.880 --> 14:21.800\n We had this summit where we got together, the two groups.\n\n14:21.800 --> 14:24.360\n So Google Brain and Google DeepMind got together\n\n14:24.360 --> 14:26.320\n and we gave a series of talks.\n\n14:26.320 --> 14:28.600\n And given that they were doing\n\n14:28.600 --> 14:30.560\n deep reinforcement learning for games,\n\n14:30.560 --> 14:33.600\n I decided to bring up part of my past,\n\n14:33.600 --> 14:35.080\n which I had developed at Berkeley,\n\n14:35.080 --> 14:37.400\n like this thing which we call Berkeley OverMind,\n\n14:37.400 --> 14:40.160\n which is really just a StarCraft one bot, right?\n\n14:40.160 --> 14:42.120\n So I talked about that.\n\n14:42.120 --> 14:44.280\n And I remember Demis just came to me and said,\n\n14:44.280 --> 14:47.120\n well, maybe not now, it's perhaps a bit too early,\n\n14:47.120 --> 14:48.920\n but you should just come to DeepMind\n\n14:48.920 --> 14:53.720\n and do this again with deep reinforcement learning, right?\n\n14:53.720 --> 14:56.600\n And at the time it sounded very science fiction\n\n14:56.600 --> 14:58.760\n for several reasons.\n\n14:58.760 --> 15:01.520\n But then in 2016, when I actually moved to London\n\n15:01.520 --> 15:04.760\n and joined DeepMind transferring from Brain,\n\n15:04.760 --> 15:08.200\n it became apparent that because of the AlphaGo moment\n\n15:08.200 --> 15:11.280\n and kind of Blizzard reaching out to us to say,\n\n15:11.280 --> 15:13.000\n wait, like, do you want the next challenge?\n\n15:13.000 --> 15:15.080\n And also me being full time at DeepMind,\n\n15:15.080 --> 15:17.440\n so sort of kind of all these came together.\n\n15:17.440 --> 15:20.960\n And then I went to Irvine in California,\n\n15:20.960 --> 15:23.800\n to the Blizzard headquarters to just chat with them\n\n15:23.800 --> 15:26.320\n and try to explain how would it all work\n\n15:26.320 --> 15:27.800\n before you do anything.\n\n15:27.800 --> 15:30.680\n And the approach has always been\n\n15:30.680 --> 15:33.640\n about the learning perspective, right?\n\n15:33.640 --> 15:38.640\n So in Berkeley, we did a lot of rule based conditioning\n\n15:39.160 --> 15:42.520\n and if you have more than three units, then go attack.\n\n15:42.520 --> 15:44.200\n And if the other has more units than me,\n\n15:44.200 --> 15:46.360\n I retreat and so on and so forth.\n\n15:46.360 --> 15:48.840\n And of course, the point of deep reinforcement learning,\n\n15:48.840 --> 15:50.480\n deep learning, machine learning in general\n\n15:50.480 --> 15:53.440\n is that all these should be learned behavior.\n\n15:53.440 --> 15:56.960\n So that kind of was the DNA of the project\n\n15:56.960 --> 15:59.480\n since its inception in 2016,\n\n15:59.480 --> 16:02.880\n where we just didn't even have an environment to work with.\n\n16:02.880 --> 16:05.840\n And so that's how it all started really.\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:08.600\n So if you go back to that conversation with Demis\n\n16:08.600 --> 16:12.200\n or even in your own head, how far away did you,\n\n16:12.200 --> 16:14.480\n because we're talking about Atari games,\n\n16:14.480 --> 16:16.680\n we're talking about Go, which is kind of,\n\n16:16.680 --> 16:20.120\n if you're honest about it, really far away from StarCraft.\n\n16:20.120 --> 16:22.160\n In, well, now that you've beaten it,\n\n16:22.160 --> 16:23.280\n maybe you could say it's close,\n\n16:23.280 --> 16:25.880\n but it's much, it seems like StarCraft\n\n16:25.880 --> 16:29.120\n is way harder than Go philosophically\n\n16:29.120 --> 16:30.880\n and mathematically speaking.\n\n16:30.880 --> 16:34.240\n So how far away did you think you were?\n\n16:34.240 --> 16:36.560\n Do you think it's 2019 and 18\n\n16:36.560 --> 16:37.960\n you could be doing as well as you have?\n\n16:37.960 --> 16:40.120\n Yeah, when I kind of thought about,\n\n16:40.120 --> 16:43.000\n okay, I'm gonna dedicate a lot of my time\n\n16:43.000 --> 16:44.080\n and focus on this.\n\n16:44.080 --> 16:47.320\n And obviously I do a lot of different research\n\n16:47.320 --> 16:48.160\n in deep learning.\n\n16:48.160 --> 16:50.000\n So spending time on it, I mean,\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.480\n I really had to kind of think\n\n16:51.480 --> 16:55.120\n there's gonna be something good happening out of this.\n\n16:55.120 --> 16:58.400\n So really I thought, well, this sounds impossible.\n\n16:58.400 --> 17:01.000\n And it probably is impossible to do the full thing,\n\n17:01.000 --> 17:06.000\n like the full game where you play one versus one\n\n17:06.080 --> 17:09.120\n and it's only a neural network playing and so on.\n\n17:09.120 --> 17:10.360\n So it really felt like,\n\n17:10.360 --> 17:13.360\n I just didn't even think it was possible.\n\n17:13.360 --> 17:14.200\n But on the other hand,\n\n17:14.200 --> 17:18.440\n I could see some stepping stones towards that goal.\n\n17:18.440 --> 17:21.000\n Clearly you could define sub problems in StarCraft\n\n17:21.000 --> 17:22.760\n and sort of dissect it a bit and say,\n\n17:22.760 --> 17:26.080\n okay, here is a part of the game, here's another part.\n\n17:26.080 --> 17:29.240\n And also obviously the fact,\n\n17:29.240 --> 17:31.120\n so this was really also critical to me,\n\n17:31.120 --> 17:34.240\n the fact that we could access human replays, right?\n\n17:34.240 --> 17:35.560\n So Blizzard was very kind.\n\n17:35.560 --> 17:38.400\n And in fact, they open source these for the whole community\n\n17:38.400 --> 17:39.800\n where you can just go\n\n17:39.800 --> 17:42.880\n and it's not every single StarCraft game ever played,\n\n17:42.880 --> 17:45.720\n but it's a lot of them you can just go and download.\n\n17:45.720 --> 17:47.000\n And every day they will,\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:48.800\n you can just query a data set and say,\n\n17:48.800 --> 17:51.520\n well, give me all the games that were played today.\n\n17:51.520 --> 17:55.640\n And given my kind of experience with language\n\n17:55.640 --> 17:57.760\n and sequences and supervised learning,\n\n17:57.760 --> 18:00.600\n I thought, well, that's definitely gonna be very helpful\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:02.240\n and something quite unique now,\n\n18:02.240 --> 18:07.240\n because ever before we had such a large data set of replays,\n\n18:08.040 --> 18:10.840\n of people playing the game at this scale\n\n18:10.840 --> 18:12.400\n of such a complex video game, right?\n\n18:12.400 --> 18:15.480\n So that to me was a precious resource.\n\n18:15.480 --> 18:17.240\n And as soon as I knew that Blizzard\n\n18:17.240 --> 18:20.800\n was able to kind of give this to the community,\n\n18:20.800 --> 18:22.080\n I started to feel positive\n\n18:22.080 --> 18:24.120\n about something non trivial happening.\n\n18:24.120 --> 18:28.240\n But I also thought the full thing, like really no rules,\n\n18:28.240 --> 18:31.120\n no single line of code that tries to say,\n\n18:31.120 --> 18:33.200\n well, I mean, if you see this unit, build a detector,\n\n18:33.200 --> 18:36.560\n all these, not having any of these specializations\n\n18:36.560 --> 18:38.960\n seemed really, really, really difficult to me.\n\n18:38.960 --> 18:39.800\n Intuitively.\n\n18:39.800 --> 18:42.520\n I do also like that Blizzard was teasing\n\n18:42.520 --> 18:43.840\n or even trolling you,\n\n18:45.360 --> 18:48.440\n sort of almost, yeah, pulling you in\n\n18:48.440 --> 18:50.160\n into this really difficult challenge.\n\n18:50.160 --> 18:51.680\n Do they have any awareness?\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:55.600\n What's the interest from the perspective of Blizzard,\n\n18:55.600 --> 18:57.240\n except just curiosity?\n\n18:57.240 --> 18:59.360\n Yeah, I think Blizzard has really understood\n\n18:59.360 --> 19:03.200\n and really bring forward this competitiveness\n\n19:03.200 --> 19:04.720\n of esports in games.\n\n19:04.720 --> 19:07.800\n The StarCraft really kind of sparked a lot of,\n\n19:07.800 --> 19:10.680\n like something that almost was never seen,\n\n19:10.680 --> 19:13.920\n especially as I was saying, back in Korea.\n\n19:13.920 --> 19:16.200\n So they just probably thought,\n\n19:16.200 --> 19:18.840\n well, this is such a pure one versus one setup\n\n19:18.840 --> 19:21.120\n that it would be great to see\n\n19:21.120 --> 19:24.840\n if something that can play Atari or Go\n\n19:24.840 --> 19:27.920\n and then later on chess could even tackle\n\n19:27.920 --> 19:30.600\n these kind of complex real time strategy game, right?\n\n19:30.600 --> 19:33.320\n So for them, they wanted to see first,\n\n19:33.320 --> 19:36.440\n obviously whether it was possible,\n\n19:36.440 --> 19:39.760\n if the game they created was in a way solvable\n\n19:39.760 --> 19:40.840\n to some extent.\n\n19:40.840 --> 19:42.160\n And I think on the other hand,\n\n19:42.160 --> 19:45.760\n they also are a pretty modern company that innovates a lot.\n\n19:45.760 --> 19:48.520\n So just starting to understand AI for them\n\n19:48.520 --> 19:50.240\n to how to bring AI into games\n\n19:50.240 --> 19:54.320\n is not AI for games, but games for AI, right?\n\n19:54.320 --> 19:56.120\n I mean, both ways I think can work.\n\n19:56.120 --> 20:00.040\n And we obviously at DeepMind use games for AI, right?\n\n20:00.040 --> 20:01.240\n To drive AI progress,\n\n20:01.240 --> 20:03.680\n but Blizzard might actually be able to do\n\n20:03.680 --> 20:06.040\n and many other companies to start to understand\n\n20:06.040 --> 20:06.880\n and do the opposite.\n\n20:06.880 --> 20:08.600\n So I think that is also something\n\n20:08.600 --> 20:09.760\n they can get out of these.\n\n20:09.760 --> 20:12.400\n And they definitely, we have brainstormed a lot\n\n20:12.400 --> 20:13.680\n about these, right?\n\n20:13.680 --> 20:15.120\n But one of the interesting things to me\n\n20:15.120 --> 20:17.560\n about StarCraft and Diablo\n\n20:17.560 --> 20:19.360\n and these games that Blizzard has created\n\n20:19.360 --> 20:23.520\n is the task of balancing classes, for example.\n\n20:23.520 --> 20:27.440\n Sort of making the game fair from the starting point\n\n20:27.440 --> 20:29.840\n and then let skill determine the outcome.\n\n20:30.920 --> 20:33.560\n Is there, I mean, can you first comment,\n\n20:33.560 --> 20:36.760\n there's three races, Zerg, Protoss and Terran.\n\n20:36.760 --> 20:38.920\n I don't know if I've ever said that out loud.\n\n20:38.920 --> 20:40.040\n Is that how you pronounce it?\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:40.880\n Terran?\n\n20:40.880 --> 20:41.720\n Yeah, Terran.\n\n20:41.720 --> 20:42.560\n Yeah.\n\n20:44.120 --> 20:46.480\n Yeah, I don't think I've ever in person interacted\n\n20:46.480 --> 20:49.600\n with anybody about StarCraft, that's funny.\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:51.800\n So they seem to be pretty balanced.\n\n20:51.800 --> 20:56.280\n I wonder if the AI, the work that you're doing\n\n20:56.280 --> 20:59.200\n with AlphaStar would help balance them even further.\n\n20:59.200 --> 21:00.560\n Is that something you think about?\n\n21:00.560 --> 21:03.360\n Is that something that Blizzard is thinking about?\n\n21:03.360 --> 21:06.440\n Right, so balancing when you add a new unit\n\n21:06.440 --> 21:09.160\n or a new spell type is obviously possible\n\n21:09.160 --> 21:13.240\n given that you can always train or pre train at scale\n\n21:13.240 --> 21:16.720\n some agent that might start using that in unintended ways.\n\n21:16.720 --> 21:19.200\n But I think actually, if you understand\n\n21:19.200 --> 21:22.240\n how StarCraft has kind of co evolved with players,\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:24.360\n in a way, I think it's actually very cool\n\n21:24.360 --> 21:27.440\n the ways that many of the things and strategies\n\n21:27.440 --> 21:28.720\n that people came up with, right?\n\n21:28.720 --> 21:32.320\n So I think we've seen it over and over in StarCraft\n\n21:32.320 --> 21:35.000\n that Blizzard comes up with maybe a new unit\n\n21:35.000 --> 21:37.280\n and then some players get creative\n\n21:37.280 --> 21:39.120\n and do something kind of unintentional\n\n21:39.120 --> 21:40.920\n or something that Blizzard designers\n\n21:40.920 --> 21:43.600\n that just simply didn't test or think about.\n\n21:43.600 --> 21:46.240\n And then after that becomes kind of mainstream\n\n21:46.240 --> 21:48.280\n in the community, Blizzard patches the game\n\n21:48.280 --> 21:51.920\n and then they kind of maybe weaken that strategy\n\n21:51.920 --> 21:53.920\n or make it actually more interesting\n\n21:53.920 --> 21:55.440\n but a bit more balanced.\n\n21:55.440 --> 21:57.760\n So these kind of continual talk between players\n\n21:57.760 --> 22:01.720\n and Blizzard is kind of what has defined them actually\n\n22:01.720 --> 22:04.040\n in actually most games in StarCraft\n\n22:04.040 --> 22:06.440\n but also in World of Warcraft, they would do that.\n\n22:06.440 --> 22:09.280\n There are several classes and it would be not good\n\n22:09.280 --> 22:13.240\n that everyone plays absolutely the same race and so on, right?\n\n22:13.240 --> 22:17.280\n So I think they do care about balancing of course\n\n22:17.280 --> 22:19.640\n and they do a fair amount of testing\n\n22:19.640 --> 22:22.120\n but it's also beautiful to also see\n\n22:22.120 --> 22:24.480\n how players get creative anyways.\n\n22:24.480 --> 22:27.440\n And I mean, whether AI can be more creative at this point,\n\n22:27.440 --> 22:28.680\n I don't think so, right?\n\n22:28.680 --> 22:31.560\n I mean, it's just sometimes something so amazing happens.\n\n22:31.560 --> 22:33.680\n Like I remember back in the days,\n\n22:33.680 --> 22:36.920\n like you have these drop ships that could drop the rivers\n\n22:36.920 --> 22:39.600\n and that was actually not thought about\n\n22:39.600 --> 22:41.280\n that you could drop this unit\n\n22:41.280 --> 22:43.240\n that has this what's called splash damage\n\n22:43.240 --> 22:45.640\n that would basically eliminate\n\n22:45.640 --> 22:47.840\n all the enemies workers at once.\n\n22:47.840 --> 22:50.120\n No one thought that you could actually put them\n\n22:50.120 --> 22:53.080\n in really early game, do that kind of damage\n\n22:53.080 --> 22:55.440\n and then things change in the game.\n\n22:55.440 --> 22:58.040\n But I don't know, I think it's quite an amazing\n\n22:58.040 --> 23:00.320\n exploration process from both sides,\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:01.880\n players and Blizzard alike.\n\n23:01.880 --> 23:05.040\n Well, it's almost like a reinforcement learning exploration\n\n23:05.040 --> 23:10.040\n but the scale of humans that play Blizzard games\n\n23:11.240 --> 23:13.720\n is almost on the scale of a large scale\n\n23:13.720 --> 23:15.360\n deep mind RL experiment.\n\n23:15.360 --> 23:17.640\n I mean, if you look at the numbers,\n\n23:17.640 --> 23:19.560\n I mean, you're talking about, I don't know how many games\n\n23:19.560 --> 23:22.080\n but hundreds of thousands of games probably a month.\n\n23:22.080 --> 23:22.920\n Yeah.\n\n23:22.920 --> 23:27.920\n I mean, so it's almost the same as running RL agents.\n\n23:28.800 --> 23:31.240\n What aspect of the problem of Starcraft\n\n23:31.240 --> 23:32.160\n do you think is the hardest?\n\n23:32.160 --> 23:35.400\n Is it the, like you said, the imperfect information?\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:38.160\n Is it the fact they have to do longterm planning?\n\n23:38.160 --> 23:40.320\n Is it the real time aspects?\n\n23:40.320 --> 23:42.240\n We have to do stuff really quickly.\n\n23:42.240 --> 23:44.760\n Is it the fact that a large action space\n\n23:44.760 --> 23:47.640\n so you can do so many possible things?\n\n23:47.640 --> 23:51.120\n Or is it, you know, in the game theoretic sense\n\n23:51.120 --> 23:52.400\n there is no Nash equilibrium\n\n23:52.400 --> 23:54.280\n or at least you don't know what the optimal strategy is\n\n23:54.280 --> 23:56.520\n because there's way too many options.\n\n23:56.520 --> 23:57.360\n Right.\n\n23:57.360 --> 23:59.520\n Is there something that stands out as just like the hardest\n\n23:59.520 --> 24:01.000\n the most annoying thing?\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:04.200\n So when we sort of looked at the problem\n\n24:04.200 --> 24:07.640\n and start to define like the parameters of it, right?\n\n24:07.640 --> 24:08.800\n What are the observations?\n\n24:08.800 --> 24:10.520\n What are the actions?\n\n24:10.520 --> 24:13.880\n It became very apparent that, you know,\n\n24:13.880 --> 24:17.160\n the very first barrier that one would hit in Starcraft\n\n24:17.160 --> 24:20.720\n would be because of the action space being so large\n\n24:20.720 --> 24:24.880\n and as not being able to search like you could in chess\n\n24:24.880 --> 24:27.320\n or go even though the search space is vast.\n\n24:28.640 --> 24:30.600\n The main problem that we identified\n\n24:30.600 --> 24:32.440\n was that of exploration, right?\n\n24:32.440 --> 24:36.720\n So without any sort of human knowledge or human prior,\n\n24:36.720 --> 24:38.040\n if you think about Starcraft\n\n24:38.040 --> 24:40.880\n and you know how deep reinforcement learnings algorithm\n\n24:40.880 --> 24:45.400\n work which is essentially by issuing random actions\n\n24:45.400 --> 24:47.840\n and hoping that they will get some wins sometimes\n\n24:47.840 --> 24:49.240\n so they could learn.\n\n24:49.240 --> 24:52.840\n So if you think of the action space in Starcraft\n\n24:52.840 --> 24:55.920\n almost anything you can do in the early game is bad\n\n24:55.920 --> 24:58.760\n because any action involves taking workers\n\n24:58.760 --> 25:01.360\n which are mining minerals for free.\n\n25:01.360 --> 25:03.560\n That's something that the game does automatically\n\n25:03.560 --> 25:04.920\n sends them to mine.\n\n25:04.920 --> 25:07.760\n And you would immediately just take them out of mining\n\n25:07.760 --> 25:09.080\n and send them around.\n\n25:09.080 --> 25:13.640\n So just thinking how is it gonna be possible\n\n25:13.640 --> 25:16.920\n to get to understand these concepts\n\n25:16.920 --> 25:19.280\n but even more like expanding, right?\n\n25:19.280 --> 25:21.080\n There's these buildings you can place\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:24.160\n in other locations in the map to gather more resources\n\n25:24.160 --> 25:26.840\n but the location of the building is important\n\n25:26.840 --> 25:28.880\n and you have to select a worker,\n\n25:28.880 --> 25:32.680\n send it walking to that location, build the building,\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:34.120\n wait for the building to be built\n\n25:34.120 --> 25:37.800\n and then put extra workers there so they start mining.\n\n25:37.800 --> 25:41.720\n That feels like impossible if you just randomly click\n\n25:41.720 --> 25:44.480\n to produce that state, desirable state\n\n25:44.480 --> 25:46.960\n that then you could hope to learn from\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:49.800\n because eventually that may yield to an extra win, right?\n\n25:49.800 --> 25:51.760\n So for me, the exploration problem\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:53.760\n and due to the action space\n\n25:53.760 --> 25:56.080\n and the fact that there's not really turns,\n\n25:56.080 --> 25:59.120\n there's so many turns because the game essentially\n\n25:59.120 --> 26:02.040\n takes that 22 times per second.\n\n26:02.040 --> 26:05.520\n I mean, that's how they could discretize sort of time.\n\n26:05.520 --> 26:07.280\n Obviously you always have to discretize time\n\n26:07.280 --> 26:09.600\n but there's no such thing as real time\n\n26:09.600 --> 26:12.520\n but it's really a lot of time steps\n\n26:12.520 --> 26:14.240\n of things that could go wrong.\n\n26:14.240 --> 26:17.920\n And that definitely felt a priori like the hardest.\n\n26:17.920 --> 26:19.320\n You mentioned many good ones.\n\n26:19.320 --> 26:21.120\n I think partial observability\n\n26:21.120 --> 26:23.440\n and the fact that there is no perfect strategy\n\n26:23.440 --> 26:25.520\n because of the partial observability.\n\n26:25.520 --> 26:26.840\n Those are very interesting problems.\n\n26:26.840 --> 26:28.520\n We start seeing more and more now\n\n26:28.520 --> 26:31.040\n in terms of as we solve the previous ones\n\n26:31.040 --> 26:34.240\n but the core problem to me was exploration\n\n26:34.240 --> 26:37.720\n and solving it has been basically kind of the focus\n\n26:37.720 --> 26:39.760\n and how we saw the first breakthroughs.\n\n26:39.760 --> 26:43.680\n So exploration in a multi hierarchical way.\n\n26:43.680 --> 26:46.560\n So like 22 times a second exploration\n\n26:46.560 --> 26:48.600\n has a very different meaning than it does\n\n26:48.600 --> 26:51.440\n in terms of should I gather resources early\n\n26:51.440 --> 26:53.200\n or should I wait or so on.\n\n26:53.200 --> 26:56.200\n So how do you solve the longterm?\n\n26:56.200 --> 26:58.080\n Let's talk about the internals of AlphaStar.\n\n26:58.080 --> 27:02.480\n So first of all, how do you represent the state\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:05.440\n of the game as an input?\n\n27:05.440 --> 27:08.800\n How do you then do the longterm sequence modeling?\n\n27:08.800 --> 27:10.760\n How do you build a policy?\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:12.560\n What's the architecture like?\n\n27:12.560 --> 27:16.840\n So AlphaStar has obviously several components\n\n27:16.840 --> 27:20.880\n but everything passes through what we call the policy\n\n27:20.880 --> 27:22.280\n which is a neural network.\n\n27:22.280 --> 27:24.280\n And that's kind of the beauty of it.\n\n27:24.280 --> 27:27.160\n There is, I could just now give you a neural network\n\n27:27.160 --> 27:28.520\n and some weights.\n\n27:28.520 --> 27:30.440\n And if you fed the right observations\n\n27:30.440 --> 27:32.560\n and you understood the actions the same way we do\n\n27:32.560 --> 27:35.120\n you would have basically the agent playing the game.\n\n27:35.120 --> 27:37.240\n There's absolutely nothing else needed\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:40.320\n other than those weights that were trained.\n\n27:40.320 --> 27:43.360\n Now, the first step is observing the game\n\n27:43.360 --> 27:46.640\n and we've experimented with a few alternatives.\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:50.280\n The one that we currently use mixes both spatial\n\n27:50.280 --> 27:53.800\n sort of images that you would process from the game\n\n27:53.800 --> 27:56.400\n that is the zoomed out version of the map\n\n27:56.400 --> 27:58.960\n and also a zoomed in version of the camera\n\n27:58.960 --> 28:00.880\n or the screen as we call it.\n\n28:00.880 --> 28:04.840\n But also we give to the agent the list of units\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:09.000\n that it sees more of as a set of objects\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.040\n that it can operate on.\n\n28:11.040 --> 28:14.760\n That is not necessarily required to use it.\n\n28:14.760 --> 28:16.840\n And we have versions of the game that play well\n\n28:16.840 --> 28:19.760\n without this set vision that is a bit not like\n\n28:19.760 --> 28:21.640\n how humans perceive the game.\n\n28:21.640 --> 28:23.600\n But it certainly helps a lot\n\n28:23.600 --> 28:26.520\n because it's a very natural way to encode the game\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:29.360\n is by just looking at all the units that there are.\n\n28:29.360 --> 28:33.920\n They have properties like health, position, type of unit\n\n28:33.920 --> 28:36.160\n whether it's my unit or the enemies.\n\n28:36.160 --> 28:40.760\n And that sort of is kind of the summary\n\n28:40.760 --> 28:43.040\n of the state of the game,\n\n28:43.040 --> 28:45.480\n that list of units or set of units\n\n28:45.480 --> 28:47.360\n that you see all the time.\n\n28:47.360 --> 28:49.560\n But that's pretty close to the way humans see the game.\n\n28:49.560 --> 28:51.520\n Why do you say it's not, isn't that,\n\n28:51.520 --> 28:55.040\n you're saying the exactness of it is not similar to humans?\n\n28:55.040 --> 28:57.200\n The exactness of it is perhaps not the problem.\n\n28:57.200 --> 28:59.800\n I guess maybe the problem if you look at it\n\n28:59.800 --> 29:02.320\n from how actually humans play the game\n\n29:02.320 --> 29:05.720\n is that they play with a mouse and a keyboard and a screen\n\n29:05.720 --> 29:08.720\n and they don't see sort of a structured object\n\n29:08.720 --> 29:09.560\n with all the units.\n\n29:09.560 --> 29:12.200\n What they see is what they see on the screen, right?\n\n29:12.200 --> 29:13.040\n So.\n\n29:13.040 --> 29:14.360\n Remember that there's a, sorry to interrupt,\n\n29:14.360 --> 29:16.960\n there's a plot that you showed with camera base\n\n29:16.960 --> 29:18.600\n where you do exactly that, right?\n\n29:18.600 --> 29:21.080\n You move around and that seems to converge\n\n29:21.080 --> 29:22.240\n to similar performance.\n\n29:22.240 --> 29:23.520\n Yeah, I think that's what I,\n\n29:23.520 --> 29:26.320\n we're kind of experimenting with what's necessary or not,\n\n29:26.320 --> 29:28.720\n but using the set.\n\n29:28.720 --> 29:32.360\n So, actually, if you look at research in computer vision,\n\n29:32.360 --> 29:35.960\n where it makes a lot of sense to treat images\n\n29:35.960 --> 29:38.160\n as two dimensional arrays,\n\n29:38.160 --> 29:40.360\n there's actually a very nice paper from Facebook.\n\n29:40.360 --> 29:42.720\n I think, I forgot who the authors are,\n\n29:42.720 --> 29:46.360\n but I think it's part of Caming's group.\n\n29:46.360 --> 29:49.520\n And what they do is they take an image,\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:51.920\n which is this two dimensional signal,\n\n29:51.920 --> 29:54.280\n and they actually take pixel by pixel\n\n29:54.280 --> 29:59.120\n and scramble the image as if it was just a list of pixels.\n\n29:59.120 --> 30:01.760\n Crucially, they encode the position of the pixels\n\n30:01.760 --> 30:03.680\n with the X, Y coordinates.\n\n30:03.680 --> 30:06.120\n And this is just kind of a new architecture,\n\n30:06.120 --> 30:08.480\n which we incidentally also use in StarCraft\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:09.800\n called the Transformer,\n\n30:09.800 --> 30:11.960\n which is a very popular paper from last year,\n\n30:11.960 --> 30:15.560\n which yielded very nice result in machine translation.\n\n30:15.560 --> 30:18.000\n And if you actually believe in this kind of,\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:20.280\n oh, it's actually a set of pixels,\n\n30:20.280 --> 30:22.520\n as long as you encode X, Y, it's okay,\n\n30:22.520 --> 30:26.080\n then you could argue that the list of units that we see\n\n30:26.080 --> 30:26.920\n is precisely that,\n\n30:26.920 --> 30:31.440\n because we have each unit as a kind of pixel, if you will,\n\n30:31.440 --> 30:33.200\n and then their X, Y coordinates.\n\n30:33.200 --> 30:36.360\n So in that perspective, we, without knowing it,\n\n30:36.360 --> 30:38.680\n we use the same architecture that was shown\n\n30:38.680 --> 30:41.360\n to work very well on Pascal and ImageNet and so on.\n\n30:41.360 --> 30:45.400\n So the interesting thing here is putting it in that way\n\n30:45.400 --> 30:46.880\n it starts to move it towards\n\n30:46.880 --> 30:49.400\n the way you usually work with language.\n\n30:49.400 --> 30:52.680\n So what, and especially with your expertise\n\n30:52.680 --> 30:55.440\n and work in language,\n\n30:55.440 --> 30:57.880\n it seems like there's echoes of a lot of\n\n30:58.920 --> 31:00.640\n the way you would work with natural language\n\n31:00.640 --> 31:02.320\n in the way you've approached AlphaStar.\n\n31:02.320 --> 31:03.160\n Right.\n\n31:03.160 --> 31:05.000\n What's, does that help\n\n31:05.000 --> 31:08.120\n with the longterm sequence modeling there somehow?\n\n31:08.120 --> 31:10.160\n Exactly, so now that we understand\n\n31:10.160 --> 31:13.520\n what an observation for a given time step is,\n\n31:13.520 --> 31:14.600\n we need to move on to say,\n\n31:14.600 --> 31:17.680\n well, there's going to be a sequence of such observations\n\n31:17.680 --> 31:21.040\n and an agent will need to, given all that it's seen,\n\n31:21.040 --> 31:24.040\n not only the current time step, but all that it's seen, why?\n\n31:24.040 --> 31:25.880\n Because there is partial observability.\n\n31:25.880 --> 31:29.000\n We must remember whether we saw a worker going somewhere,\n\n31:29.000 --> 31:30.040\n for instance, right?\n\n31:30.040 --> 31:31.680\n Because then there might be an expansion\n\n31:31.680 --> 31:33.560\n on the top right of the map.\n\n31:33.560 --> 31:37.920\n So given that, what you must then think about is\n\n31:37.920 --> 31:40.320\n there is the problem of given all the observations,\n\n31:40.320 --> 31:42.560\n you have to predict the next action.\n\n31:42.560 --> 31:44.440\n And not only given all the observations,\n\n31:44.440 --> 31:45.880\n but given all the observations\n\n31:45.880 --> 31:47.840\n and given all the actions you've taken,\n\n31:47.840 --> 31:49.280\n predict the next action.\n\n31:49.280 --> 31:53.520\n And that sounds exactly like machine translation where,\n\n31:53.520 --> 31:57.080\n and that's exactly how kind of I saw the problem,\n\n31:57.080 --> 31:59.920\n especially when you are given supervised data\n\n31:59.920 --> 32:01.680\n or replays from humans,\n\n32:01.680 --> 32:03.520\n because the problem is exactly the same.\n\n32:03.520 --> 32:07.600\n You're translating essentially a prefix of observations\n\n32:07.600 --> 32:10.080\n and actions onto what's going to happen next,\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:12.920\n which is exactly how you would train a model to translate\n\n32:12.920 --> 32:14.680\n or to generate language as well, right?\n\n32:14.680 --> 32:16.560\n Do you have a certain prefix?\n\n32:16.560 --> 32:18.920\n You must remember everything that comes in the past\n\n32:18.920 --> 32:22.560\n because otherwise you might start having noncoherent text.\n\n32:22.560 --> 32:26.480\n And the same architectures we're using LSTMs\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:29.680\n and transformers to operate on across time\n\n32:29.680 --> 32:33.000\n to kind of integrate all that's happened in the past.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:35.640\n Those architectures that work so well in translation\n\n32:35.640 --> 32:38.320\n or language modeling are exactly the same\n\n32:38.320 --> 32:42.280\n than what the agent is using to issue actions in the game.\n\n32:42.280 --> 32:44.680\n And the way we train it, moreover, for imitation,\n\n32:44.680 --> 32:47.040\n which is step one of AlphaStar is,\n\n32:47.040 --> 32:49.800\n take all the human experience and try to imitate it,\n\n32:49.800 --> 32:52.840\n much like you try to imitate translators\n\n32:52.840 --> 32:55.280\n that translated many pairs of sentences\n\n32:55.280 --> 32:57.200\n from French to English say,\n\n32:57.200 --> 33:00.120\n that sort of principle applies exactly the same.\n\n33:00.120 --> 33:04.440\n It's almost the same code, except that instead of words,\n\n33:04.440 --> 33:06.600\n you have a slightly more complicated objects,\n\n33:06.600 --> 33:08.840\n which are the observations and the actions\n\n33:08.840 --> 33:11.720\n are also a bit more complicated than a word.\n\n33:11.720 --> 33:13.920\n Is there a self play component then too?\n\n33:13.920 --> 33:16.480\n So once you run out of imitation?\n\n33:16.480 --> 33:21.480\n Right, so indeed you can bootstrap from human replays,\n\n33:22.240 --> 33:25.960\n but then the agents you get are actually not as good\n\n33:25.960 --> 33:28.160\n as the humans you imitated, right?\n\n33:28.160 --> 33:30.440\n So how do we imitate?\n\n33:30.440 --> 33:34.280\n Well, we take humans from 3000 MMR and higher.\n\n33:34.280 --> 33:37.960\n 3000 MMR is just a metric of human skill\n\n33:37.960 --> 33:41.880\n and 3000 MMR might be like 50% percentile, right?\n\n33:41.880 --> 33:43.760\n So it's just average human.\n\n33:43.760 --> 33:44.600\n What's that?\n\n33:44.600 --> 33:47.760\n So maybe quick pause, MMR is a ranking scale,\n\n33:47.760 --> 33:50.320\n the matchmaking rating for players.\n\n33:50.320 --> 33:52.320\n So it's 3000, I remember there's like a master\n\n33:52.320 --> 33:54.120\n and a grand master, what's 3000?\n\n33:54.120 --> 33:56.720\n So 3000 is pretty bad.\n\n33:56.720 --> 33:58.440\n I think it's kind of goals level.\n\n33:58.440 --> 34:00.680\n It just sounds really good relative to chess, I think.\n\n34:00.680 --> 34:02.440\n Oh yeah, yeah, no, the ratings,\n\n34:02.440 --> 34:05.320\n the best in the world are at 7,000 MMR.\n\n34:05.320 --> 34:07.840\n So 3000, it's a bit like Elo indeed, right?\n\n34:07.840 --> 34:12.840\n So 3,500 just allows us to not filter a lot of the data.\n\n34:13.200 --> 34:15.680\n So we like to have a lot of data in deep learning\n\n34:15.680 --> 34:17.320\n as you probably know.\n\n34:17.320 --> 34:20.640\n So we take these kind of 3,500 and above,\n\n34:20.640 --> 34:22.680\n but then we do a very interesting trick,\n\n34:22.680 --> 34:25.000\n which is we tell the neural network\n\n34:25.000 --> 34:27.560\n what level they are imitating.\n\n34:27.560 --> 34:30.800\n So we say, this replay you're gonna try to imitate\n\n34:30.800 --> 34:33.040\n to predict the next action for all the actions\n\n34:33.040 --> 34:36.120\n that you're gonna see is a 4,000 MMR replay.\n\n34:36.120 --> 34:38.840\n This one is a 6,000 MMR replay.\n\n34:38.840 --> 34:42.520\n And what's cool about this is then we take this policy\n\n34:42.520 --> 34:44.320\n that is being trained from human,\n\n34:44.320 --> 34:47.440\n and then we can ask it to play like a 3000 MMR player\n\n34:47.440 --> 34:49.600\n by setting a beat saying, well, okay,\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:51.280\n play like a 3000 MMR player\n\n34:51.280 --> 34:53.720\n or play like a 6,000 MMR player.\n\n34:53.720 --> 34:57.320\n And you actually see how the policy behaves differently.\n\n34:57.320 --> 35:01.520\n It gets worse economy if you play like a goal level player,\n\n35:01.520 --> 35:03.000\n it does less actions per minute,\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:05.360\n which is the number of clicks or number of actions\n\n35:05.360 --> 35:07.800\n that you will issue in a whole minute.\n\n35:07.800 --> 35:09.240\n And it's very interesting to see\n\n35:09.240 --> 35:12.360\n that it kind of imitates the skill level quite well.\n\n35:12.360 --> 35:15.480\n But if we ask it to play like a 6,000 MMR player,\n\n35:15.480 --> 35:18.640\n we tested, of course, these policies to see how well they do.\n\n35:18.640 --> 35:20.600\n They actually beat all the built in AIs\n\n35:20.600 --> 35:22.440\n that Blizzard put in the game,\n\n35:22.440 --> 35:25.000\n but they're nowhere near 6,000 MMR players, right?\n\n35:25.000 --> 35:29.280\n They might be maybe around goal level, platinum, perhaps.\n\n35:29.280 --> 35:32.240\n So there's still a lot of work to be done for the policy\n\n35:32.240 --> 35:35.000\n to truly understand what it means to win.\n\n35:35.000 --> 35:38.240\n So far, we only asked them, okay, here is the screen.\n\n35:38.240 --> 35:41.680\n And that's what's happened on the game until this point.\n\n35:41.680 --> 35:46.160\n What would the next action be if we ask a pro to now say,\n\n35:46.160 --> 35:49.160\n oh, you're gonna click here or here or there.\n\n35:49.160 --> 35:53.720\n And the point is experiencing wins and losses\n\n35:53.720 --> 35:56.400\n is very important to then start to refine.\n\n35:56.400 --> 35:58.400\n Otherwise the policy can get loose,\n\n35:58.400 --> 36:00.520\n can just go off policy as we call it.\n\n36:00.520 --> 36:03.480\n That's so interesting that you can at least hope eventually\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:06.840\n to be able to control a policy\n\n36:06.840 --> 36:10.000\n approximately to be at some MMR level.\n\n36:10.000 --> 36:12.720\n That's so interesting, especially given that you have\n\n36:12.720 --> 36:15.080\n ground truth for a lot of these cases.\n\n36:15.080 --> 36:17.560\n Can I ask you a personal question?\n\n36:17.560 --> 36:19.240\n What's your MMR?\n\n36:19.240 --> 36:23.680\n Well, I haven't played StarCraft II, so I am unranked,\n\n36:23.680 --> 36:26.200\n which is the kind of lowest league.\n\n36:26.200 --> 36:29.600\n So I used to play StarCraft, the first one.\n\n36:29.600 --> 36:32.680\n But you haven't seriously played StarCraft II.\n\n36:32.680 --> 36:37.680\n So the best player we have at DeepMind is about 5,000 MMR,\n\n36:37.760 --> 36:39.640\n which is high masters.\n\n36:39.640 --> 36:42.120\n It's not at grand master level.\n\n36:42.120 --> 36:44.680\n Grand master level will be the top 200 players\n\n36:44.680 --> 36:47.960\n in a certain region like Europe or America or Asia.\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:51.640\n But for me, it would be hard to say.\n\n36:51.640 --> 36:53.760\n I am very bad at the game.\n\n36:53.760 --> 36:56.680\n I actually played AlphaStar a bit too late and it beat me.\n\n36:56.680 --> 36:59.760\n I remember the whole team was, oh, Oreo, you should play.\n\n36:59.760 --> 37:02.240\n And I was, oh, it looks like it's not so good yet.\n\n37:02.240 --> 37:04.960\n And then I remember I kind of got busy\n\n37:04.960 --> 37:07.320\n and waited an extra week and I played\n\n37:07.320 --> 37:09.760\n and it really beat me very badly.\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:11.560\n Was that, I mean, how did that feel?\n\n37:11.560 --> 37:12.720\n Isn't that an amazing feeling?\n\n37:12.720 --> 37:13.640\n That's amazing, yeah.\n\n37:13.640 --> 37:16.560\n I mean, obviously I tried my best\n\n37:16.560 --> 37:18.120\n and I tried to also impress my,\n\n37:18.120 --> 37:19.840\n because I actually played the first game.\n\n37:19.840 --> 37:23.160\n So I'm still pretty good at micromanagement.\n\n37:23.160 --> 37:25.320\n The problem is I just don't understand StarCraft II.\n\n37:25.320 --> 37:27.000\n I understand StarCraft.\n\n37:27.000 --> 37:28.560\n And when I played StarCraft,\n\n37:28.560 --> 37:32.760\n I probably was consistently like for a couple of years,\n\n37:32.760 --> 37:34.720\n top 32 in Europe.\n\n37:34.720 --> 37:37.280\n So I was decent, but at the time we didn't have\n\n37:37.280 --> 37:40.400\n this kind of MMR system as well established.\n\n37:40.400 --> 37:43.240\n So it would be hard to know what it was back then.\n\n37:43.240 --> 37:44.720\n So what's the difference in interface\n\n37:44.720 --> 37:47.800\n between AlphaStar and StarCraft\n\n37:47.800 --> 37:49.720\n and a human player in StarCraft?\n\n37:49.720 --> 37:52.120\n Is there any significant differences\n\n37:52.120 --> 37:54.200\n between the way they both see the game?\n\n37:54.200 --> 37:56.080\n I would say the way they see the game,\n\n37:56.080 --> 37:59.760\n there's a few things that are just very hard to simulate.\n\n38:01.080 --> 38:05.240\n The main one perhaps, which is obvious in hindsight\n\n38:05.240 --> 38:10.240\n is what's called cloaked units, which are invisible units.\n\n38:10.600 --> 38:13.280\n So in StarCraft, you can make some units\n\n38:13.280 --> 38:16.800\n that you need to have a particular kind of unit\n\n38:16.800 --> 38:18.080\n to detect it.\n\n38:18.080 --> 38:20.600\n So these units are invisible.\n\n38:20.600 --> 38:22.760\n If you cannot detect them, you cannot target them.\n\n38:22.760 --> 38:25.800\n So they would just destroy your buildings\n\n38:25.800 --> 38:27.760\n or kill your workers.\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:31.680\n But despite the fact you cannot target the unit,\n\n38:31.680 --> 38:34.640\n there's a shimmer that as a human you observe.\n\n38:34.640 --> 38:35.960\n I mean, you need to train a little bit,\n\n38:35.960 --> 38:37.480\n you need to pay attention,\n\n38:37.480 --> 38:41.920\n but you would see this kind of space time distortion\n\n38:41.920 --> 38:44.880\n and you would know, okay, there are, yeah.\n\n38:44.880 --> 38:46.080\n Yeah, there's like a wave thing.\n\n38:46.080 --> 38:47.720\n Yeah, it's called shimmer.\n\n38:47.720 --> 38:49.200\n Space time distortion, I like it.\n\n38:49.200 --> 38:51.960\n That's really like, the Blizzard term is shimmer.\n\n38:51.960 --> 38:52.800\n Shimmer, okay.\n\n38:52.800 --> 38:55.600\n And so these shimmer professional players\n\n38:55.600 --> 38:57.160\n actually can see it immediately.\n\n38:57.160 --> 38:59.520\n They understand it very well,\n\n38:59.520 --> 39:01.440\n but it's still something that requires\n\n39:01.440 --> 39:02.720\n certain amount of attention\n\n39:02.720 --> 39:05.680\n and it's kind of a bit annoying to deal with.\n\n39:05.680 --> 39:08.640\n Whereas for AlphaStar, in terms of vision,\n\n39:08.640 --> 39:11.120\n it's very hard for us to simulate sort of,\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:14.200\n oh, are you looking at this pixel in the screen and so on?\n\n39:14.200 --> 39:17.520\n So the only thing we can do is,\n\n39:17.520 --> 39:19.720\n there is a unit that's invisible over there.\n\n39:19.720 --> 39:22.520\n So AlphaStar would know that immediately.\n\n39:22.520 --> 39:24.040\n Obviously still obeys the rules.\n\n39:24.040 --> 39:25.200\n You cannot attack the unit.\n\n39:25.200 --> 39:27.440\n You must have a detector and so on,\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:29.360\n but it's kind of one of the main things\n\n39:29.360 --> 39:32.720\n that it just doesn't feel there's a very proper way.\n\n39:32.720 --> 39:35.520\n I mean, you could imagine, oh, you don't have hypers.\n\n39:35.520 --> 39:37.000\n Maybe you don't know exactly where it is,\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.280\n or sometimes you see it, sometimes you don't,\n\n39:39.280 --> 39:43.040\n but it's just really, really complicated to get it\n\n39:43.040 --> 39:44.320\n so that everyone would agree,\n\n39:44.320 --> 39:47.680\n oh, that's the best way to simulate this, right?\n\n39:47.680 --> 39:49.320\n It seems like a perception problem.\n\n39:49.320 --> 39:50.640\n It is a perception problem.\n\n39:50.640 --> 39:54.280\n So the only problem is people, you ask,\n\n39:54.280 --> 39:55.320\n oh, what's the difference between\n\n39:55.320 --> 39:56.760\n how humans perceive the game?\n\n39:56.760 --> 39:59.960\n I would say they wouldn't be able to tell a shimmer\n\n39:59.960 --> 40:02.240\n immediately as it appears on the screen,\n\n40:02.240 --> 40:05.640\n whereas AlphaStar in principle sees it very sharply, right?\n\n40:05.640 --> 40:08.680\n It sees that the bit turned from zero to one,\n\n40:08.680 --> 40:10.480\n meaning there's now a unit there,\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:11.960\n although you don't know the unit,\n\n40:11.960 --> 40:15.840\n or you know that you cannot attack it and so on.\n\n40:15.840 --> 40:18.080\n So that from a vision standpoint,\n\n40:18.080 --> 40:22.960\n that probably is the one that is kind of the most obvious one.\n\n40:22.960 --> 40:25.160\n Then there are things humans cannot do perfectly,\n\n40:25.160 --> 40:28.080\n even professionals, which is they might miss a detail,\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:30.600\n or they might have not seen a unit.\n\n40:30.600 --> 40:32.240\n And obviously as a computer,\n\n40:32.240 --> 40:35.000\n if there's a corner of the screen that turns green\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.680\n because a unit enters the field of view,\n\n40:37.680 --> 40:41.040\n that can go into the memory of the agent, the LSTM,\n\n40:41.040 --> 40:42.480\n and persist there for a while,\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:45.680\n and for however long is relevant, right?\n\n40:45.680 --> 40:47.680\n And in terms of action,\n\n40:47.680 --> 40:50.720\n it seems like the rate of action from AlphaStar\n\n40:50.720 --> 40:54.280\n is comparative, if not slower than professional players,\n\n40:54.280 --> 40:57.120\n but it's more precise is what I read.\n\n40:57.120 --> 41:01.840\n So that's really probably the one that is causing us\n\n41:01.840 --> 41:05.000\n more issues for a couple of reasons, right?\n\n41:05.000 --> 41:08.400\n The first one is StarCraft has been an AI environment\n\n41:08.400 --> 41:09.960\n for quite a few years.\n\n41:09.960 --> 41:12.760\n In fact, I mean, I was participating\n\n41:12.760 --> 41:15.880\n in the very first competition back in 2010.\n\n41:15.880 --> 41:19.880\n And there's really not been a kind of a very clear set\n\n41:19.880 --> 41:22.320\n of rules how the actions per minute,\n\n41:22.320 --> 41:24.720\n the rate of actions that you can issue is.\n\n41:24.720 --> 41:29.280\n And as a result, these agents or bots that people build\n\n41:29.280 --> 41:31.080\n in a kind of almost very cool way,\n\n41:31.080 --> 41:35.400\n they do like 20,000, 40,000 actions per minute.\n\n41:35.400 --> 41:37.200\n Now, to put this in perspective,\n\n41:37.200 --> 41:39.520\n a very good professional human\n\n41:39.520 --> 41:44.080\n might do 300 to 800 actions per minute.\n\n41:44.080 --> 41:45.480\n They might not be as precise.\n\n41:45.480 --> 41:49.040\n That's why the range is a bit tricky to identify exactly.\n\n41:49.040 --> 41:51.560\n I mean, 300 actions per minute precisely\n\n41:51.560 --> 41:53.400\n is probably realistic.\n\n41:53.400 --> 41:56.960\n 800 is probably not, but you see humans doing a lot of actions\n\n41:56.960 --> 41:59.480\n because they warm up and they kind of select things\n\n41:59.480 --> 42:02.240\n and spam and so on just so that when they need,\n\n42:02.240 --> 42:04.320\n they have the accuracy.\n\n42:04.320 --> 42:09.680\n So we came into this by not having kind of a standard way\n\n42:09.680 --> 42:13.240\n to say, well, how do we measure whether an agent is\n\n42:13.240 --> 42:15.760\n at human level or not?\n\n42:15.760 --> 42:18.320\n On the other hand, we had a huge advantage,\n\n42:18.320 --> 42:21.360\n which is because we do imitation learning,\n\n42:21.360 --> 42:24.480\n agents turned out to act like humans\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:26.240\n in terms of rate of actions, even\n\n42:26.240 --> 42:28.720\n precisions and imprecisions of actions\n\n42:28.720 --> 42:30.160\n in the supervised policy.\n\n42:30.160 --> 42:31.160\n You could see all these.\n\n42:31.160 --> 42:34.600\n You could see how agents like to spam click, to move here.\n\n42:34.600 --> 42:37.280\n If you played especially Diablo, you wouldn't know what I mean.\n\n42:37.280 --> 42:39.720\n I mean, you just like spam, oh, move here, move here,\n\n42:39.720 --> 42:40.320\n move here.\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:43.280\n You're doing literally like maybe five actions\n\n42:43.280 --> 42:45.640\n in two seconds, but these actions are not\n\n42:45.640 --> 42:46.840\n very meaningful.\n\n42:46.840 --> 42:48.720\n One would have sufficed.\n\n42:48.720 --> 42:52.080\n So on the one hand, we start from this imitation policy\n\n42:52.080 --> 42:55.600\n that is at the ballpark of the actions per minutes of humans\n\n42:55.600 --> 42:57.280\n because it's actually statistically\n\n42:57.280 --> 42:58.920\n trying to imitate humans.\n\n42:58.920 --> 43:01.040\n So we see these very nicely in the curves\n\n43:01.040 --> 43:02.480\n that we showed in the blog post.\n\n43:02.480 --> 43:04.480\n There's these actions per minute,\n\n43:04.480 --> 43:07.640\n and the distribution looks very human like.\n\n43:07.640 --> 43:10.920\n But then, of course, as self play kicks in,\n\n43:10.920 --> 43:13.240\n and that's the part we haven't talked too much yet,\n\n43:13.240 --> 43:17.160\n but of course, the agent must play against itself to improve,\n\n43:17.160 --> 43:19.600\n then there's almost no guarantees\n\n43:19.600 --> 43:22.400\n that these actions will not become more precise\n\n43:22.400 --> 43:26.120\n or even the rate of actions is going to increase over time.\n\n43:26.120 --> 43:29.080\n So what we did, and this is probably\n\n43:29.080 --> 43:31.200\n the first attempt that we thought was reasonable,\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:33.120\n is we looked at the distribution of actions\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:36.360\n for humans for certain windows of time.\n\n43:36.360 --> 43:39.280\n And just to give a perspective, because I guess I mentioned\n\n43:39.280 --> 43:41.640\n that some of these agents that are programmatic,\n\n43:41.640 --> 43:42.320\n let's call them.\n\n43:42.320 --> 43:44.560\n They do 40,000 actions per minute.\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:47.320\n Professionals, as I said, do 300 to 800.\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:49.400\n So what we looked is we look at the distribution\n\n43:49.400 --> 43:53.680\n over professional gamers, and we took reasonably high actions\n\n43:53.680 --> 43:57.400\n per minute, but we kind of identify certain cutoffs\n\n43:57.400 --> 44:00.520\n after which, even if the agent wanted to act,\n\n44:00.520 --> 44:02.920\n these actions would be dropped.\n\n44:02.920 --> 44:07.040\n But the problem is this cutoff is probably set a bit too high.\n\n44:07.040 --> 44:10.040\n And what ends up happening, even though the games,\n\n44:10.040 --> 44:12.040\n and when we ask the professionals and the gamers,\n\n44:12.040 --> 44:15.840\n by and large, they feel like it's playing humanlike,\n\n44:15.840 --> 44:20.640\n there are some agents that developed maybe slightly\n\n44:20.640 --> 44:24.200\n too high APMs, which is actions per minute,\n\n44:24.200 --> 44:27.000\n combined with the precision, which\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:30.520\n made people start discussing a very interesting issue, which\n\n44:30.520 --> 44:32.440\n is, should we have limited these?\n\n44:32.440 --> 44:35.880\n Should we just let it lose and see what cool things\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:37.040\n it can come up with?\n\n44:37.040 --> 44:37.520\n Right?\n\n44:37.520 --> 44:38.200\n Interesting.\n\n44:38.200 --> 44:41.520\n So this is in itself an extremely interesting\n\n44:41.520 --> 44:44.000\n question, but the same way that modeling the shimmer\n\n44:44.000 --> 44:47.720\n would be so difficult, modeling absolutely all the details\n\n44:47.720 --> 44:51.680\n about muscles and precision and tiredness of humans\n\n44:51.680 --> 44:52.960\n would be quite difficult.\n\n44:52.960 --> 44:56.280\n So we're really here kind of innovating\n\n44:56.280 --> 44:58.960\n in this sense of, OK, what could be maybe\n\n44:58.960 --> 45:02.040\n the next iteration of putting more rules that\n\n45:02.040 --> 45:06.360\n makes the agents more humanlike in terms of restrictions?\n\n45:06.360 --> 45:08.120\n Yeah, putting constraints that.\n\n45:08.120 --> 45:09.240\n More constraints, yeah.\n\n45:09.240 --> 45:10.200\n That's really interesting.\n\n45:10.200 --> 45:11.200\n That's really innovative.\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:15.360\n So one of the constraints you put on yourself,\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:18.040\n or at least focused in, is on the Protoss race,\n\n45:18.040 --> 45:19.920\n as far as I understand.\n\n45:19.920 --> 45:21.920\n Can you tell me about the different races\n\n45:21.920 --> 45:26.000\n and how they, so Protoss, Terran, and Zerg,\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.080\n how do they compare?\n\n45:27.080 --> 45:28.160\n How do they interact?\n\n45:28.160 --> 45:30.360\n Why did you choose Protoss?\n\n45:30.360 --> 45:34.000\n Yeah, in the dynamics of the game seen\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.680\n from a strategic perspective.\n\n45:35.680 --> 45:39.680\n So Protoss, so in StarCraft there are three races.\n\n45:39.680 --> 45:43.880\n Indeed, in the demonstration, we saw only the Protoss race.\n\n45:43.880 --> 45:45.560\n So maybe let's start with that one.\n\n45:45.560 --> 45:49.440\n Protoss is kind of the most technologically advanced race.\n\n45:49.440 --> 45:53.800\n It has units that are expensive but powerful.\n\n45:53.800 --> 45:57.880\n So in general, you want to kind of conserve your units\n\n45:57.880 --> 45:59.520\n as you go attack.\n\n45:59.520 --> 46:03.280\n And then you want to utilize these tactical advantages\n\n46:03.280 --> 46:07.320\n of very fancy spells and so on and so forth.\n\n46:07.320 --> 46:11.480\n And at the same time, they're kind of,\n\n46:11.480 --> 46:15.280\n people say they're a bit easier to play perhaps.\n\n46:15.280 --> 46:17.160\n But that I actually didn't know.\n\n46:17.160 --> 46:20.160\n I mean, I just talked now a lot to the players\n\n46:20.160 --> 46:23.360\n that we work with, TLO and Mana, and they said, oh yeah,\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:24.720\n Protoss is actually, people think,\n\n46:24.720 --> 46:26.360\n is actually one of the easiest races.\n\n46:26.360 --> 46:28.840\n So perhaps the easier, that doesn't\n\n46:28.840 --> 46:32.680\n mean that it's obviously professional players\n\n46:32.680 --> 46:34.120\n excel at the three races.\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:37.560\n And there's never a race that dominates\n\n46:37.560 --> 46:38.800\n for a very long time anyway.\n\n46:38.800 --> 46:41.680\n So if you look at the top, I don't know, 100 in the world,\n\n46:41.680 --> 46:44.280\n is there one race that dominates that list?\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:46.840\n It would be hard to know because it depends on the regions.\n\n46:46.840 --> 46:50.600\n I think it's pretty equal in terms of distribution.\n\n46:50.600 --> 46:53.360\n And Blizzard wants it to be equal.\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:56.280\n They wouldn't want one race like Protoss\n\n46:56.280 --> 46:59.880\n to not be representative in the top place.\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:03.800\n So definitely, they tried it to be balanced.\n\n47:03.800 --> 47:07.280\n So then maybe the opposite race of Protoss is Zerg.\n\n47:07.280 --> 47:11.680\n Zerg is a race where you just kind of expand and take over\n\n47:11.680 --> 47:14.360\n as many resources as you can, and they\n\n47:14.360 --> 47:17.760\n have a very high capacity to regenerate their units.\n\n47:17.760 --> 47:20.920\n So if you have an army, it's not that valuable in terms\n\n47:20.920 --> 47:23.920\n of losing the whole army is not a big deal as Zerg\n\n47:23.920 --> 47:25.840\n because you can then rebuild it.\n\n47:25.840 --> 47:28.320\n And given that you generally accumulate\n\n47:28.320 --> 47:31.800\n a huge bank of resources, Zergs typically\n\n47:31.800 --> 47:34.200\n play by applying a lot of pressure,\n\n47:34.200 --> 47:37.040\n maybe losing their whole army, but then rebuilding it\n\n47:37.040 --> 47:37.920\n quickly.\n\n47:37.920 --> 47:42.560\n So although, of course, every race, I mean, there's never,\n\n47:42.560 --> 47:43.960\n I mean, they're pretty diverse.\n\n47:43.960 --> 47:45.320\n I mean, there are some units in Zerg that\n\n47:45.320 --> 47:47.160\n are technologically advanced, and they do\n\n47:47.160 --> 47:48.760\n some very interesting spells.\n\n47:48.760 --> 47:51.360\n And there's some units in Protoss that are less valuable,\n\n47:51.360 --> 47:53.480\n and you could lose a lot of them and rebuild them,\n\n47:53.480 --> 47:55.080\n and it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\n47:55.080 --> 47:57.840\n All right, so maybe I'm missing out.\n\n47:57.840 --> 48:01.680\n Maybe I'm going to say some dumb stuff, but summary\n\n48:01.680 --> 48:02.520\n of strategy.\n\n48:02.520 --> 48:05.720\n So first, there's collection of a lot of resources.\n\n48:05.720 --> 48:06.560\n That's one option.\n\n48:06.560 --> 48:11.560\n The other one is expanding, so building other bases.\n\n48:11.920 --> 48:15.640\n Then the other is obviously building units\n\n48:15.640 --> 48:17.160\n and attacking with those units.\n\n48:17.160 --> 48:20.640\n And then I don't know what else there is.\n\n48:20.640 --> 48:24.080\n Maybe there's the different timing of attacks,\n\n48:24.080 --> 48:26.000\n like do I attack early, attack late?\n\n48:26.000 --> 48:28.000\n What are the different strategies that emerged\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:29.120\n that you've learned about?\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:31.360\n I've read that a bunch of people are super happy\n\n48:31.360 --> 48:34.440\n that you guys have apparently, that Alpha Star apparently\n\n48:34.440 --> 48:36.400\n has discovered that it's really good to,\n\n48:36.400 --> 48:38.040\n what is it, saturate?\n\n48:38.040 --> 48:39.600\n Oh yeah, the mineral line.\n\n48:39.600 --> 48:41.400\n Yeah, the mineral line.\n\n48:41.400 --> 48:42.240\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n48:42.240 --> 48:45.640\n And that's for greedy amateur players like myself.\n\n48:45.640 --> 48:47.520\n That's always been a good strategy.\n\n48:47.520 --> 48:49.040\n You just build up a lot of money,\n\n48:49.040 --> 48:53.320\n and it just feels good to just accumulate and accumulate.\n\n48:53.320 --> 48:56.720\n So thank you for discovering that and validating all of us.\n\n48:56.720 --> 48:59.240\n But is there other strategies that you discovered\n\n48:59.240 --> 49:01.840\n that are interesting, unique to this game?\n\n49:01.840 --> 49:05.280\n Yeah, so if you look at the kind of,\n\n49:05.280 --> 49:06.480\n not being a StarCraft II player,\n\n49:06.480 --> 49:08.080\n but of course StarCraft and StarCraft II\n\n49:08.080 --> 49:11.040\n and real time strategy games in general are very similar.\n\n49:12.120 --> 49:17.120\n I would classify perhaps the openings of the game.\n\n49:17.560 --> 49:18.760\n They're very important.\n\n49:18.760 --> 49:21.760\n And generally I would say there's two kinds of openings.\n\n49:21.760 --> 49:23.400\n One that's a standard opening.\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:28.400\n That's generally how players find sort of a balance\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:32.880\n between risk and economy and building some units early on\n\n49:32.880 --> 49:34.080\n so that they could defend,\n\n49:34.080 --> 49:36.280\n but they're not too exposed basically,\n\n49:36.280 --> 49:38.920\n but also expanding quite quickly.\n\n49:38.920 --> 49:41.520\n So this would be kind of a standard opening.\n\n49:41.520 --> 49:43.120\n And within a standard opening,\n\n49:43.120 --> 49:45.320\n then what you do choose generally is\n\n49:45.320 --> 49:47.840\n what technology are you aiming towards?\n\n49:47.840 --> 49:49.760\n So there's a bit of rock, paper, scissors\n\n49:49.760 --> 49:52.400\n of you could go for spaceships\n\n49:52.400 --> 49:54.560\n or you could go for invisible units\n\n49:54.560 --> 49:55.920\n or you could go for, I don't know,\n\n49:55.920 --> 49:58.760\n like massive units that attack against certain kinds\n\n49:58.760 --> 50:01.080\n of units, but they're weak against others.\n\n50:01.080 --> 50:05.200\n So standard openings themselves have some choices\n\n50:05.200 --> 50:06.960\n like rock, paper, scissors style.\n\n50:06.960 --> 50:08.480\n Of course, if you scout and you're good\n\n50:08.480 --> 50:10.520\n at guessing what the opponent is doing,\n\n50:10.520 --> 50:12.240\n then you can play as an advantage\n\n50:12.240 --> 50:13.920\n because if you know you're gonna play rock,\n\n50:13.920 --> 50:15.920\n I mean, I'm gonna play paper obviously.\n\n50:15.920 --> 50:18.600\n So you can imagine that normal standard games\n\n50:18.600 --> 50:22.400\n in StarCraft looks like a continuous rock, paper,\n\n50:22.400 --> 50:26.080\n scissors game where you guess what the distribution\n\n50:26.080 --> 50:29.400\n of rock, paper, and scissors is from the enemy\n\n50:29.400 --> 50:32.840\n and reacting accordingly to try to beat it\n\n50:32.840 --> 50:36.880\n or put the paper out before he kind of changes his mind\n\n50:36.880 --> 50:38.360\n from rock to scissors,\n\n50:38.360 --> 50:39.960\n and then you would be in a weak position.\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:41.640\n So, sorry to pause on that.\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:42.800\n I didn't realize this element\n\n50:42.800 --> 50:44.360\n because I know it's true with poker.\n\n50:44.360 --> 50:45.840\n I know I looked at Labratus.\n\n50:48.320 --> 50:51.720\n So you're also estimating trying to guess the distribution,\n\n50:51.720 --> 50:53.680\n trying to better and better estimate the distribution\n\n50:53.680 --> 50:55.560\n of what the opponent is likely to be doing.\n\n50:55.560 --> 50:56.960\n Yeah, I mean, as a player,\n\n50:56.960 --> 50:59.360\n you definitely wanna have a belief state\n\n50:59.360 --> 51:02.520\n over what's up on the other side of the map.\n\n51:02.520 --> 51:05.080\n And when your belief state becomes inaccurate,\n\n51:05.080 --> 51:07.560\n when you start having that serious doubts,\n\n51:07.560 --> 51:10.800\n whether he's gonna play something that you must know,\n\n51:10.800 --> 51:11.920\n that's when you scout.\n\n51:11.920 --> 51:14.040\n You wanna then gather information, right?\n\n51:14.040 --> 51:15.960\n Is improving the accuracy of the belief\n\n51:15.960 --> 51:19.360\n or improving the belief state part of the loss\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:20.560\n that you're trying to optimize?\n\n51:20.560 --> 51:22.360\n Or is it just a side effect?\n\n51:22.360 --> 51:25.440\n It's implicit, but you could explicitly model it,\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:27.880\n and it would be quite good at probably predicting\n\n51:27.880 --> 51:30.000\n what's on the other side of the map.\n\n51:30.000 --> 51:32.520\n But so far, it's all implicit.\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:36.320\n There's no additional reward for predicting the enemy.\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:38.400\n So there's these standard openings,\n\n51:38.400 --> 51:41.240\n and then there's what people call cheese,\n\n51:41.240 --> 51:42.400\n which is very interesting.\n\n51:42.400 --> 51:46.360\n And AlphaStar sometimes really likes this kind of cheese.\n\n51:46.360 --> 51:50.440\n These cheeses, what they are is kind of an all in strategy.\n\n51:50.440 --> 51:53.240\n You're gonna do something sneaky.\n\n51:53.240 --> 51:56.680\n You're gonna hide your own buildings\n\n51:56.680 --> 51:58.200\n close to the enemy base,\n\n51:58.200 --> 52:01.600\n or you're gonna go for hiding your technological buildings\n\n52:01.600 --> 52:03.040\n so that you do invisible units\n\n52:03.040 --> 52:06.040\n and the enemy just cannot react to detect it\n\n52:06.040 --> 52:07.960\n and thus lose the game.\n\n52:07.960 --> 52:10.000\n And there's quite a few of these cheeses\n\n52:10.000 --> 52:11.760\n and variants of them.\n\n52:11.760 --> 52:14.480\n And there it's where actually the belief state\n\n52:14.480 --> 52:16.360\n becomes even more important.\n\n52:16.360 --> 52:20.200\n Because if I scout your base and I see no buildings at all,\n\n52:20.200 --> 52:22.480\n any human player knows something's up.\n\n52:22.480 --> 52:23.320\n They might know, well,\n\n52:23.320 --> 52:25.640\n you're hiding something close to my base.\n\n52:25.640 --> 52:28.400\n Should I build suddenly a lot of units to defend?\n\n52:28.400 --> 52:31.000\n Should I actually block my ramp with workers\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:33.520\n so that you cannot come and destroy my base?\n\n52:33.520 --> 52:35.680\n So there's all this is happening\n\n52:35.680 --> 52:39.440\n and defending against cheeses is extremely important.\n\n52:39.440 --> 52:40.800\n And in the AlphaStar League,\n\n52:40.800 --> 52:45.080\n many agents actually develop some cheesy strategies.\n\n52:45.080 --> 52:48.040\n And in the games we saw against TLO and Mana,\n\n52:48.040 --> 52:49.240\n two out of the 10 agents\n\n52:49.240 --> 52:51.760\n were actually doing these kind of strategies\n\n52:51.760 --> 52:53.640\n which are cheesy strategies.\n\n52:53.640 --> 52:55.600\n And then there's a variant of cheesy strategy\n\n52:55.600 --> 52:57.360\n which is called all in.\n\n52:57.360 --> 53:00.440\n So an all in strategy is not perhaps as drastic as,\n\n53:00.440 --> 53:02.520\n oh, I'm gonna build cannons on your base\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:03.840\n and then bring all my workers\n\n53:03.840 --> 53:06.800\n and try to just disrupt your base and game over,\n\n53:06.800 --> 53:08.760\n or GG as we say in StarCraft.\n\n53:09.800 --> 53:11.960\n There's these kind of very cool things\n\n53:11.960 --> 53:14.720\n that you can align precisely at a certain time mark.\n\n53:14.720 --> 53:15.680\n So for instance,\n\n53:15.680 --> 53:19.520\n you can generate exactly 10 unit composition\n\n53:19.520 --> 53:21.440\n that is perfect, like five of this type,\n\n53:21.440 --> 53:22.920\n five of this other type,\n\n53:22.920 --> 53:24.360\n and align the upgrade\n\n53:24.360 --> 53:27.240\n so that at four minutes and a half, let's say,\n\n53:27.240 --> 53:30.600\n you have these 10 units and the upgrade just finished.\n\n53:30.600 --> 53:33.960\n And at that point, that army is really scary.\n\n53:33.960 --> 53:36.440\n And unless the enemy really knows what's going on,\n\n53:36.440 --> 53:40.240\n if you push, you might then have an advantage\n\n53:40.240 --> 53:42.440\n because maybe the enemy is doing something more standard,\n\n53:42.440 --> 53:45.760\n it expanded too much, it developed too much economy,\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:49.720\n and it trade off badly against having defenses,\n\n53:49.720 --> 53:51.120\n and the enemy will lose.\n\n53:51.120 --> 53:53.640\n But it's called all in because if you don't win,\n\n53:53.640 --> 53:55.040\n then you're gonna lose.\n\n53:55.040 --> 53:57.960\n So you see players that do these kinds of strategies,\n\n53:57.960 --> 54:00.000\n if they don't succeed, game is not over.\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:01.200\n I mean, they still have a base\n\n54:01.200 --> 54:02.840\n and they still gathering minerals,\n\n54:02.840 --> 54:04.760\n but they will just GG out of the game\n\n54:04.760 --> 54:06.760\n because they know, well, game is over.\n\n54:06.760 --> 54:08.840\n I gambled and I failed.\n\n54:08.840 --> 54:12.480\n So if we start entering the game theoretic aspects\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:15.200\n of the game, it's really rich and it's really,\n\n54:15.200 --> 54:17.960\n that's why it also makes it quite entertaining to watch.\n\n54:17.960 --> 54:21.760\n Even if I don't play, I still enjoy watching the game.\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:26.760\n But the agents are trying to do this mostly implicitly.\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:29.120\n But one element that we improved in self play\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:31.400\n is creating the Alpha Star League.\n\n54:31.400 --> 54:34.640\n And the Alpha Star League is not pure self play.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:37.960\n It's trying to create a different personalities of agents\n\n54:37.960 --> 54:41.560\n so that some of them will become cheesy agents.\n\n54:41.560 --> 54:44.440\n Some of them might become very economical, very greedy,\n\n54:44.440 --> 54:46.240\n like getting all the resources,\n\n54:46.240 --> 54:48.840\n but then being maybe early on, they're gonna be weak,\n\n54:48.840 --> 54:51.080\n but later on, they're gonna be very strong.\n\n54:51.080 --> 54:53.480\n And by creating this personality of agents,\n\n54:53.480 --> 54:55.440\n which sometimes it just happens naturally\n\n54:55.440 --> 54:58.280\n that you can see kind of an evolution of agents\n\n54:58.280 --> 55:00.840\n that given the previous generation,\n\n55:00.840 --> 55:02.000\n they train against all of them\n\n55:02.000 --> 55:04.400\n and then they generate kind of the perfect counter\n\n55:04.400 --> 55:05.800\n to that distribution.\n\n55:05.800 --> 55:09.320\n But these agents, you must have them in the populations\n\n55:09.320 --> 55:11.320\n because if you don't have them,\n\n55:11.320 --> 55:13.440\n you're not covered against these things.\n\n55:13.440 --> 55:17.120\n You wanna create all sorts of the opponents\n\n55:17.120 --> 55:18.680\n that you will find in the wild.\n\n55:18.680 --> 55:23.120\n So you can be exposed to these cheeses, early aggression,\n\n55:23.120 --> 55:25.760\n later aggression, more expansions,\n\n55:25.760 --> 55:29.600\n dropping units in your base from the side, all these things.\n\n55:29.600 --> 55:32.800\n And pure self play is getting a bit stuck\n\n55:32.800 --> 55:36.240\n at finding some subset of these, but not all of these.\n\n55:36.240 --> 55:38.400\n So the Alpha Star League is a way\n\n55:38.400 --> 55:41.600\n to kind of do an ensemble of agents\n\n55:41.600 --> 55:43.520\n that they're all playing in a league,\n\n55:43.520 --> 55:45.560\n much like people play on Battle.net, right?\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:47.480\n They play, you play against someone\n\n55:47.480 --> 55:50.280\n who does a new cool strategy and you immediately,\n\n55:50.280 --> 55:53.080\n oh my God, I wanna try it, I wanna play again.\n\n55:53.080 --> 55:57.600\n And this to me was another critical part of the problem,\n\n55:57.600 --> 56:01.280\n which was, can we create a Battle.net for agents?\n\n56:01.280 --> 56:03.560\n And that's kind of what the Alpha Star League really is.\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:04.400\n That's fascinating.\n\n56:04.400 --> 56:06.920\n And where they stick to their different strategies.\n\n56:06.920 --> 56:09.880\n Yeah, wow, that's really, really interesting.\n\n56:09.880 --> 56:13.240\n But that said, you were fortunate enough\n\n56:13.240 --> 56:16.280\n or just skilled enough to win five, zero.\n\n56:17.320 --> 56:19.280\n And so how hard is it to win?\n\n56:19.280 --> 56:20.320\n I mean, that's not the goal.\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:21.880\n I guess, I don't know what the goal is.\n\n56:21.880 --> 56:25.400\n The goal should be to win majority, not five, zero,\n\n56:25.400 --> 56:29.360\n but how hard is it in general to win all matchups\n\n56:29.360 --> 56:31.080\n on a one V one?\n\n56:31.080 --> 56:33.600\n So that's a very interesting question\n\n56:33.600 --> 56:38.600\n because once you see Alpha Star and superficially\n\n56:38.680 --> 56:40.520\n you think, well, okay, it won.\n\n56:40.520 --> 56:42.960\n Let's, if you sum all the games like 10 to one, right?\n\n56:42.960 --> 56:46.280\n It lost the game that it played with the camera interface.\n\n56:46.280 --> 56:48.760\n You might think, well, that's done, right?\n\n56:48.760 --> 56:50.800\n It's superhuman at the game.\n\n56:50.800 --> 56:54.760\n And that's not really the claim we really can make actually.\n\n56:55.960 --> 56:58.800\n The claim is we beat a professional gamer\n\n56:58.800 --> 57:00.080\n for the first time.\n\n57:00.080 --> 57:02.440\n StarCraft has really been a thing\n\n57:02.440 --> 57:04.080\n that has been going on for a few years,\n\n57:04.080 --> 57:09.080\n but a moment like this had not occurred before yet.\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:12.360\n But are these agents impossible to beat?\n\n57:12.360 --> 57:13.400\n Absolutely not, right?\n\n57:13.400 --> 57:17.320\n So that's a bit what's kind of the difference is\n\n57:17.320 --> 57:19.520\n the agents play at grandmaster level.\n\n57:19.520 --> 57:21.480\n They definitely understand the game enough\n\n57:21.480 --> 57:24.920\n to play extremely well, but are they unbeatable?\n\n57:24.920 --> 57:26.600\n Do they play perfect?\n\n57:26.600 --> 57:29.280\n No, and actually in StarCraft,\n\n57:29.280 --> 57:32.160\n because of these sneaky strategies,\n\n57:32.160 --> 57:34.920\n it's always possible that you might take a huge risk\n\n57:34.920 --> 57:36.880\n sometimes, but you might get wins, right?\n\n57:36.880 --> 57:38.160\n Out of this.\n\n57:38.160 --> 57:41.560\n So I think that as a domain,\n\n57:41.560 --> 57:43.320\n it still has a lot of opportunities,\n\n57:43.320 --> 57:45.840\n not only because of course we wanna learn\n\n57:45.840 --> 57:47.720\n with less experience, we would like to,\n\n57:47.720 --> 57:49.680\n I mean, if I learned to play Protoss,\n\n57:49.680 --> 57:52.520\n I can play Terran and learn it much quicker\n\n57:52.520 --> 57:53.640\n than Alpha Star can, right?\n\n57:53.640 --> 57:56.720\n So there are obvious interesting research challenges\n\n57:56.720 --> 58:01.720\n as well, but even as the raw performance goes,\n\n58:02.320 --> 58:05.200\n really the claim here can be we are at pro level\n\n58:05.200 --> 58:08.320\n or at high grandmaster level,\n\n58:08.320 --> 58:13.320\n but obviously the players also did not know what to expect,\n\n58:13.440 --> 58:14.280\n right?\n\n58:14.280 --> 58:15.960\n Their prior distribution was a bit off\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:19.400\n because they played this kind of new like alien brain\n\n58:19.400 --> 58:21.000\n as they like to say it, right?\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:24.120\n And that's what makes it exciting for them.\n\n58:24.120 --> 58:27.160\n But also I think if you look at the games closely,\n\n58:27.160 --> 58:30.680\n you see there were weaknesses in some points,\n\n58:30.680 --> 58:32.520\n maybe Alpha Star did not scout,\n\n58:32.520 --> 58:35.240\n or if it had invisible units going against\n\n58:35.240 --> 58:37.400\n at certain points, it wouldn't have known\n\n58:37.400 --> 58:38.800\n and it would have been bad.\n\n58:38.800 --> 58:42.160\n So there's still quite a lot of work to do,\n\n58:42.160 --> 58:44.680\n but it's really a very exciting moment for us\n\n58:44.680 --> 58:48.400\n to be seeing, wow, a single neural net on a GPU\n\n58:48.400 --> 58:50.240\n is actually playing against these guys\n\n58:50.240 --> 58:51.280\n who are amazing.\n\n58:51.280 --> 58:52.920\n I mean, you have to see them play in life.\n\n58:52.920 --> 58:55.040\n They're really, really amazing players.\n\n58:55.040 --> 58:59.320\n Yeah, I'm sure there must be a guy in Poland\n\n58:59.320 --> 59:02.000\n somewhere right now training his butt off\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:05.920\n to make sure that this never happens again with Alpha Star.\n\n59:05.920 --> 59:09.080\n So that's really exciting in terms of Alpha Star\n\n59:09.080 --> 59:11.520\n having some holes to exploit, which is great.\n\n59:11.520 --> 59:13.720\n And then we build on top of each other\n\n59:13.720 --> 59:16.360\n and it feels like StarCraft on let go,\n\n59:16.360 --> 59:20.640\n even if you win, it's still not,\n\n59:20.640 --> 59:23.120\n there's so many different dimensions\n\n59:23.120 --> 59:24.200\n in which you can explore.\n\n59:24.200 --> 59:25.560\n So that's really, really interesting.\n\n59:25.560 --> 59:28.520\n Do you think there's a ceiling to Alpha Star?\n\n59:28.520 --> 59:31.360\n You've said that it hasn't reached,\n\n59:31.360 --> 59:32.840\n you know, this is a big,\n\n59:32.840 --> 59:35.520\n wait, let me actually just pause for a second.\n\n59:35.520 --> 59:40.200\n How did it feel to come here to this point,\n\n59:40.200 --> 59:42.240\n to beat a top professional player?\n\n59:42.240 --> 59:44.600\n Like that night, I mean, you know,\n\n59:44.600 --> 59:47.120\n Olympic athletes have their gold medal, right?\n\n59:47.120 --> 59:48.840\n This is your gold medal in a sense.\n\n59:48.840 --> 59:50.400\n Sure, you're cited a lot,\n\n59:50.400 --> 59:53.120\n you've published a lot of prestigious papers, whatever,\n\n59:53.120 --> 59:55.280\n but this is like a win.\n\n59:55.280 --> 59:56.480\n How did it feel?\n\n59:56.480 --> 59:59.440\n I mean, it was, for me, it was unbelievable\n\n59:59.440 --> 1:00:03.920\n because first the win itself,\n\n1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:05.080\n I mean, it was so exciting.\n\n1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:10.080\n I mean, so looking back to those last days of 2018 really,\n\n1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.120\n that's when the games were played.\n\n1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:15.240\n I'm sure I look back at that moment, I'll say,\n\n1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:18.000\n oh my God, I want to be in a project like that.\n\n1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.120\n It's like, I already feel the nostalgia of like,\n\n1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:24.240\n yeah, that was huge in terms of the energy\n\n1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.360\n and the team effort that went into it.\n\n1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:29.240\n And so in that sense, as soon as it happened,\n\n1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:31.280\n I already knew it was kind of,\n\n1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.000\n I was losing it a little bit.\n\n1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.320\n So it is almost like sad that it happened and oh my God,\n\n1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:41.320\n but on the other hand, it also verifies the approach.\n\n1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.800\n But to me also, there's so many challenges\n\n1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:46.080\n and interesting aspects of intelligence\n\n1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:49.840\n that even though we can train a neural network\n\n1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:52.680\n to play at the level of the best humans,\n\n1:00:52.680 --> 1:00:54.200\n there's still so many challenges.\n\n1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.680\n So for me, it's also like, well,\n\n1:00:55.680 --> 1:00:57.440\n this is really an amazing achievement,\n\n1:00:57.440 --> 1:00:59.920\n but I already was also thinking about next steps.\n\n1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:04.080\n I mean, as I said, these Asians play Protoss versus Protoss,\n\n1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:07.200\n but they should be able to play a different race\n\n1:01:07.200 --> 1:01:08.120\n much quicker, right?\n\n1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.640\n So that would be an amazing achievement.\n\n1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:13.360\n Some people call this meta reinforcement learning,\n\n1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:15.200\n meta learning and so on, right?\n\n1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:18.960\n So there's so many possibilities after that moment,\n\n1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:21.520\n but the moment itself, it really felt great.\n\n1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:27.760\n We had this bet, so I'm kind of a pessimist in general.\n\n1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:29.920\n So I kind of send an email to the team.\n\n1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:33.680\n I said, okay, let's against TLO first, right?\n\n1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:35.120\n Like what's gonna be the result?\n\n1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:38.680\n And I really thought we would lose like five zero, right?\n\n1:01:38.680 --> 1:01:43.680\n We had some calibration made against the 5,000 MMR player.\n\n1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:47.360\n TLO was much stronger than that player,\n\n1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:50.040\n even if he played Protoss, which is his off race.\n\n1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:53.120\n But yeah, I was not imagining we would win.\n\n1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:55.600\n So for me, that was just kind of a test run or something.\n\n1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.000\n And then it really kind of, he was really surprised.\n\n1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000\n And unbelievably, we went to this bar to celebrate\n\n1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:08.360\n and Dave tells me, well, why don't we invite someone\n\n1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:10.960\n who is a thousand MMR stronger in Protoss,\n\n1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.520\n like actual Protoss player,\n\n1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:16.160\n like that it turned up being Mana, right?\n\n1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:19.360\n And we had some drinks and I said, sure, why not?\n\n1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:20.200\n But then I thought, well,\n\n1:02:20.200 --> 1:02:22.040\n that's really gonna be impossible to beat.\n\n1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:24.560\n I mean, even because it's so much ahead,\n\n1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:28.400\n a thousand MMR is really like 99% probability\n\n1:02:28.400 --> 1:02:33.040\n that Mana would beat TLO as Protoss versus Protoss, right?\n\n1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.200\n So we did that.\n\n1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:38.960\n And to me, the second game was much more important,\n\n1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.080\n even though a lot of uncertainty kind of disappeared\n\n1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:43.640\n after we kind of beat TLO.\n\n1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:45.640\n I mean, he is a professional player.\n\n1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:46.840\n So that was kind of, oh,\n\n1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:49.720\n but that's really a very nice achievement.\n\n1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:51.760\n But Mana really was at the top\n\n1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:53.840\n and you could see he played much better,\n\n1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:55.360\n but our agents got much better too.\n\n1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:59.480\n So it's like, ah, and then after the first game,\n\n1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:00.880\n I said, if we take a single game,\n\n1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:02.720\n at least we can say we beat a game.\n\n1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:04.320\n I mean, even if we don't beat the series,\n\n1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:06.920\n for me, that was a huge relief.\n\n1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:09.200\n And I mean, I remember the hugging demis.\n\n1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.840\n And I mean, it was really like,\n\n1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:14.160\n this moment for me will resonate forever as a researcher.\n\n1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:15.360\n And I mean, as a person,\n\n1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:18.240\n and yeah, it's a really like great accomplishment.\n\n1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:21.360\n And it was great also to be there with the team in the room.\n\n1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:23.040\n I don't know if you saw like this.\n\n1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:24.720\n So it was really like.\n\n1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:25.960\n I mean, from my perspective,\n\n1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:29.840\n the other interesting thing is just like watching Kasparov,\n\n1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:33.720\n watching Mana was also interesting\n\n1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:36.120\n because he didn't, he has kind of a loss of words.\n\n1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:38.600\n I mean, whenever you lose, I've done a lot of sports.\n\n1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:43.520\n You sometimes say excuses, you look for reasons.\n\n1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:46.240\n And he couldn't really come up with reasons.\n\n1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:50.000\n I mean, so with the off race for Protoss,\n\n1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.280\n you could say, well, it felt awkward, it wasn't,\n\n1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:55.160\n but here it was just beaten.\n\n1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:57.920\n And it was beautiful to look at a human being\n\n1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:00.240\n being superseded by an AI system.\n\n1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:04.400\n I mean, it's a beautiful moment for researchers, so.\n\n1:04:04.400 --> 1:04:05.960\n Yeah, for sure it was.\n\n1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:09.920\n I mean, probably the highlight of my career so far\n\n1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:11.760\n because of its uniqueness and coolness.\n\n1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:14.240\n And I don't know, I mean, it's obviously, as you said,\n\n1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.200\n you can look at papers, citations and so on,\n\n1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:19.240\n but these really is like a testament\n\n1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:21.200\n of the whole machine learning approach\n\n1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:24.640\n and using games to advance technology.\n\n1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:26.840\n I mean, it really was,\n\n1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:28.840\n everything came together at that moment.\n\n1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:29.840\n That's really the summary.\n\n1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:34.040\n Also on the other side, it's a popularization of AI too,\n\n1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:38.200\n because it's just like traveling to the moon and so on.\n\n1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:41.000\n I mean, this is where a very large community of people\n\n1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.120\n that don't really know AI,\n\n1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:45.200\n they get to really interact with it.\n\n1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:46.040\n Which is very important.\n\n1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:48.640\n I mean, we must, you know,\n\n1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:51.400\n writing papers helps our peers, researchers,\n\n1:04:51.400 --> 1:04:52.520\n to understand what we're doing.\n\n1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:55.880\n But I think AI is becoming mature enough\n\n1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:59.000\n that we must sort of try to explain what it is.\n\n1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.440\n And perhaps through games is an obvious way\n\n1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.640\n because these games always had built in AI.\n\n1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:07.680\n So it may be everyone experience an AI playing a video game,\n\n1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:08.520\n even if they don't know,\n\n1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:10.240\n because there's always some scripted element\n\n1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:13.040\n and some people might even call that AI already, right?\n\n1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.320\n So what are other applications\n\n1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:19.080\n of the approaches underlying AlphaStar\n\n1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:20.280\n that you see happening?\n\n1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.360\n There's a lot of echoes of, you said,\n\n1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:25.440\n transformer of language modeling and so on.\n\n1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:27.120\n Have you already started thinking\n\n1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:30.400\n where the breakthroughs in AlphaStar\n\n1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.280\n get expanded to other applications?\n\n1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.640\n Right, so I thought about a few things\n\n1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:37.280\n for like kind of next month, next years.\n\n1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:41.480\n The main thing I'm thinking about actually is what's next\n\n1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.160\n as a kind of a grand challenge.\n\n1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:47.120\n Because for me, like we've seen Atari\n\n1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.280\n and then there's like the sort of three dimensional walls\n\n1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:52.520\n that we've seen also like pretty good performance\n\n1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:54.120\n from these capture the flag agents\n\n1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:56.440\n that also some people at DeepMind and elsewhere\n\n1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:57.600\n are working on.\n\n1:05:57.600 --> 1:05:59.600\n We've also seen some amazing results on like,\n\n1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:03.280\n for instance, Dota 2, which is also a very complicated game.\n\n1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:05.960\n So for me, like the main thing I'm thinking about\n\n1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:07.960\n is what's next in terms of challenge.\n\n1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:12.960\n So as a researcher, I see sort of two tensions\n\n1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:16.760\n between research and then applications or areas\n\n1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:18.480\n or domains where you apply them.\n\n1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.480\n So on the one hand, we've done,\n\n1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:23.320\n thanks to the application of StarCraft is very hard.\n\n1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:25.600\n We developed some techniques, some new research\n\n1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.480\n that now we could look at elsewhere.\n\n1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:30.520\n Like are there other applications where we can apply these?\n\n1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:32.880\n And the obvious ones, absolutely.\n\n1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:37.440\n You can think of feeding back to sort of the community\n\n1:06:37.440 --> 1:06:40.240\n we took from, which was mostly sequence modeling\n\n1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:41.680\n or natural language processing.\n\n1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:46.120\n So we've developed and extended things from the transformer\n\n1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:48.120\n and we use pointer networks.\n\n1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:51.280\n We combine LSTM and transformers in interesting ways.\n\n1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:54.200\n So that's perhaps the kind of lowest hanging fruit\n\n1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:57.600\n of feeding back to now a different field\n\n1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:00.880\n of machine learning that's not playing video games.\n\n1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:05.680\n Let me go old school and jump to Mr. Alan Turing.\n\n1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:09.920\n So the Turing test is a natural language test,\n\n1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:11.560\n a conversational test.\n\n1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:15.760\n What's your thought of it as a test for intelligence?\n\n1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.320\n Do you think it is a grand challenge\n\n1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:18.920\n that's worthy of undertaking?\n\n1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:22.440\n Maybe if it is, would you reformulate it or phrase it\n\n1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:23.640\n somehow differently?\n\n1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:25.600\n Right, so I really love the Turing test\n\n1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:29.480\n because I also like sequences and language understanding.\n\n1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:32.120\n And in fact, some of the early work\n\n1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:33.640\n we did in machine translation, we\n\n1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:38.680\n tried to apply to kind of a neural chatbot, which obviously\n\n1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:42.200\n would never pass the Turing test because it was very limited.\n\n1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:45.160\n But it is a very fascinating idea\n\n1:07:45.160 --> 1:07:49.760\n that you could really have an AI that\n\n1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:53.840\n would be indistinguishable from humans in terms of asking\n\n1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:56.000\n or conversing with it.\n\n1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.680\n So I think the test itself seems very nice.\n\n1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:02.560\n And it's kind of well defined, actually,\n\n1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:04.840\n like the passing it or not.\n\n1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:06.520\n I think there's quite a few rules\n\n1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:09.080\n that feel pretty simple.\n\n1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:14.680\n And I think they have these competitions every year.\n\n1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:15.920\n Yes, there's the Lebner Prize.\n\n1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:22.240\n But I don't know if you've seen the kind of bots\n\n1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:24.120\n that emerge from that competition.\n\n1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:27.960\n They're not quite as what you would.\n\n1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:30.640\n So it feels like that there's weaknesses with the way Turing\n\n1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:31.400\n formulated it.\n\n1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:34.960\n It needs to be that the definition\n\n1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:39.880\n of a genuine, rich, fulfilling human conversation,\n\n1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.640\n it needs to be something else.\n\n1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.880\n Like the Alexa Prize, which I'm not as well familiar with,\n\n1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:46.440\n has tried to define that more, I think,\n\n1:08:46.440 --> 1:08:48.560\n by saying you have to continue keeping\n\n1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:52.200\n a conversation for 30 minutes, something like that.\n\n1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:55.480\n So basically forcing the agent not to just fool,\n\n1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:57.600\n but to have an engaging conversation kind of thing.\n\n1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:06.520\n Have you thought about this problem richly?\n\n1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:10.720\n And if you have in general, how far away are we from?\n\n1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:14.160\n You worked a lot on language understanding,\n\n1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.640\n language generation, but the full dialogue,\n\n1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.880\n the conversation, just sitting at the bar\n\n1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:21.680\n having a couple of beers for an hour,\n\n1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:22.920\n that kind of conversation.\n\n1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:23.640\n Have you thought about it?\n\n1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:25.160\n Yeah, so I think you touched here\n\n1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:28.960\n on the critical point, which is feasibility.\n\n1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:32.840\n So there's a great essay by Hamming,\n\n1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:37.280\n which describes sort of grand challenges of physics.\n\n1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:41.040\n And he argues that, well, OK, for instance,\n\n1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:44.680\n teleportation or time travel are great grand challenges\n\n1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.600\n of physics, but there's no attacks.\n\n1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.360\n We really don't know or cannot kind of make any progress.\n\n1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:53.320\n So that's why most physicists and so on,\n\n1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:55.320\n they don't work on these in their PhDs\n\n1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:57.840\n and as part of their careers.\n\n1:09:57.840 --> 1:10:00.880\n So I see the Turing test, in the full Turing test,\n\n1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:02.720\n as a bit still too early.\n\n1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.680\n Like I think we're, especially with the current trend\n\n1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:10.040\n of deep learning language models,\n\n1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:11.600\n we've seen some amazing examples.\n\n1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.360\n I think GPT2 being the most recent one, which\n\n1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.760\n is very impressive.\n\n1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:21.000\n But to understand to fully solve passing or fooling a human\n\n1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.440\n to think that there's a human on the other side,\n\n1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:24.880\n I think we're quite far.\n\n1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:27.240\n So as a result, I don't see myself\n\n1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:30.480\n and I probably would not recommend people doing a PhD\n\n1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:32.360\n on solving the Turing test because it just\n\n1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:35.400\n feels it's kind of too early or too hard of a problem.\n\n1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.800\n Yeah, but that said, you said the exact same thing\n\n1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:40.560\n about StarCraft about a few years ago.\n\n1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:41.040\n Indeed.\n\n1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:41.560\n To Demis.\n\n1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:46.200\n So you'll probably also be the person who passes\n\n1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.120\n the Turing test in three years.\n\n1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:50.920\n I mean, I think that, yeah.\n\n1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:52.040\n So we have this on record.\n\n1:10:52.040 --> 1:10:52.640\n This is nice.\n\n1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:53.520\n It's true.\n\n1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:56.560\n I mean, it's true that progress sometimes\n\n1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.800\n is a bit unpredictable.\n\n1:10:57.800 --> 1:10:59.200\n I really wouldn't have not.\n\n1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:02.440\n Even six months ago, I would not have predicted the level\n\n1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:06.160\n that we see that these agents can deliver at grandmaster\n\n1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:07.800\n level.\n\n1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:10.040\n But I have worked on language enough.\n\n1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:13.600\n And basically, my concern is not that something could happen,\n\n1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:16.400\n a breakthrough could happen that would bring us to solving\n\n1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:19.160\n or passing the Turing test, is that I just\n\n1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:24.120\n think the statistical approach to it is not going to cut it.\n\n1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:28.240\n So we need a breakthrough, which is great for the community.\n\n1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:31.800\n But given that, I think there's quite more uncertainty.\n\n1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:36.120\n Whereas for StarCraft, I knew what the steps would\n\n1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:38.120\n be to get us there.\n\n1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:41.560\n I think it was clear that using the imitation learning part\n\n1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:44.320\n and then using this battle net for agents\n\n1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:45.440\n were going to be key.\n\n1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:48.280\n And it turned out that this was the case.\n\n1:11:48.280 --> 1:11:51.560\n And a little more was needed, but not much more.\n\n1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:53.640\n For Turing test, I just don't know\n\n1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:56.080\n what the plan or execution plan would look like.\n\n1:11:56.080 --> 1:12:00.680\n So that's why I myself working on it as a grand challenge\n\n1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:01.480\n is hard.\n\n1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:03.880\n But there are quite a few sub challenges\n\n1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.600\n that are related that you could say,\n\n1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:09.040\n well, I mean, what if you create a great assistant\n\n1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:11.400\n like Google already has, like the Google Assistant.\n\n1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.120\n So can we make it better?\n\n1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:15.400\n And can we make it fully neural and so on?\n\n1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:17.440\n That I start to believe maybe we're\n\n1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:20.640\n reaching a point where we should attempt these challenges.\n\n1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:23.520\n I like this conversation so much because it echoes very much\n\n1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:24.840\n the StarCraft conversation.\n\n1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:26.880\n It's exactly how you approach StarCraft.\n\n1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:29.600\n Let's break it down into small pieces and solve those.\n\n1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:31.320\n And you end up solving the whole game.\n\n1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:31.920\n Great.\n\n1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:34.120\n But that said, you're behind some\n\n1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:37.960\n of the biggest pieces of work in deep learning\n\n1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:40.360\n in the last several years.\n\n1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:42.280\n So you mentioned some limits.\n\n1:12:42.280 --> 1:12:44.880\n What do you think of the current limits of deep learning?\n\n1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:47.160\n And how do we overcome those limits?\n\n1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:50.160\n So if I had to actually use a single word\n\n1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:53.240\n to define the main challenge in deep learning,\n\n1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:55.120\n it's a challenge that probably has\n\n1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:56.960\n been the challenge for many years.\n\n1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:59.720\n And it's that of generalization.\n\n1:12:59.720 --> 1:13:04.560\n So what that means is that all that we're doing\n\n1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.720\n is fitting functions to data.\n\n1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:12.160\n And when the data we see is not from the same distribution,\n\n1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:14.520\n or even if there are some times that it\n\n1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:17.320\n is very close to distribution, but because\n\n1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.240\n of the way we train it with limited samples,\n\n1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:23.560\n we then get to this stage where we just\n\n1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:27.800\n don't see generalization as much as we can generalize.\n\n1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:31.240\n And I think adversarial examples are a clear example of this.\n\n1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.640\n But if you study machine learning and literature,\n\n1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.280\n and the reason why SVMs came very popular\n\n1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:40.040\n were because they were dealing and they\n\n1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.640\n had some guarantees about generalization, which\n\n1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:45.600\n is unseen data or out of distribution,\n\n1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:48.280\n or even within distribution where you take an image adding\n\n1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:51.360\n a bit of noise, these models fail.\n\n1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:56.680\n So I think, really, I don't see a lot of progress\n\n1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:00.520\n on generalization in the strong generalization\n\n1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:01.800\n sense of the word.\n\n1:14:01.800 --> 1:14:05.960\n I think our neural networks, you can always\n\n1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:11.040\n find design examples that will make their outputs arbitrary,\n\n1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:15.600\n which is not good because we humans would never\n\n1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:17.880\n be fooled by these kind of images\n\n1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:19.880\n or manipulation of the image.\n\n1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:21.760\n And if you look at the mathematics,\n\n1:14:21.760 --> 1:14:23.960\n you kind of understand this is a bunch of matrices\n\n1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:26.160\n multiplied together.\n\n1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:28.040\n There's probably numerics and instability\n\n1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.920\n that you can just find corner cases.\n\n1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:35.240\n So I think that's really the underlying topic many times\n\n1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:40.120\n we see when even at the grand stage of Turing test\n\n1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:44.520\n generalization, if you start passing the Turing test,\n\n1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.840\n should it be in English or should it be in any language?\n\n1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:53.200\n As a human, if you ask something in a different language,\n\n1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:54.920\n you actually will go and do some research\n\n1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:57.720\n and try to translate it and so on.\n\n1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:01.000\n Should the Turing test include that?\n\n1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.920\n And it's really a difficult problem\n\n1:15:02.920 --> 1:15:05.480\n and very fascinating and very mysterious, actually.\n\n1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:06.280\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:10.760\n But do you think if you were to try to solve it,\n\n1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:14.240\n can you not grow the size of data intelligently\n\n1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:17.080\n in such a way that the distribution of your training\n\n1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:20.880\n set does include the entirety of the testing set?\n\n1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:21.760\n Is that one path?\n\n1:15:21.760 --> 1:15:23.840\n The other path is totally a new methodology.\n\n1:15:23.840 --> 1:15:24.960\n It's not statistical.\n\n1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:27.920\n So a path that has worked well, and it worked well\n\n1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:30.720\n in StarCraft and in machine translation and in languages,\n\n1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:32.800\n scaling up the data and the model.\n\n1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:38.480\n And that's kind of been maybe the only single formula that\n\n1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:40.480\n still delivers today in deep learning, right?\n\n1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:44.960\n It's that data scale and model scale really\n\n1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:47.040\n do more and more of the things that we thought,\n\n1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:49.240\n oh, there's no way it can generalize to these,\n\n1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.320\n or there's no way it can generalize to that.\n\n1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:54.760\n But I don't think fundamentally it will be solved with this.\n\n1:15:54.760 --> 1:15:59.600\n And for instance, I'm really liking some style or approach\n\n1:15:59.600 --> 1:16:02.120\n that would not only have neural networks,\n\n1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:06.360\n but it would have programs or some discrete decision making,\n\n1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:10.320\n because there is where I feel there's a bit more.\n\n1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:13.520\n I mean, the best example, I think, for understanding this\n\n1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:16.640\n is I also worked a bit on, oh, we\n\n1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:18.820\n can learn an algorithm with a neural network, right?\n\n1:16:18.820 --> 1:16:20.560\n So you give it many examples, and it's\n\n1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:24.360\n going to sort the input numbers or something like that.\n\n1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:29.520\n But really strong generalization is you give me some numbers\n\n1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:32.320\n or you ask me to create an algorithm that sorts numbers.\n\n1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:34.760\n And instead of creating a neural net, which will be fragile\n\n1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:37.960\n because it's going to go out of range at some point,\n\n1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.840\n you're going to give it numbers that are too large, too small,\n\n1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:45.600\n and whatnot, if you just create a piece of code that\n\n1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:47.240\n sorts the numbers, then you can prove\n\n1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:50.600\n that that will generalize to absolutely all the possible\n\n1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:51.960\n input you could give.\n\n1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:55.920\n So I think the problem comes with some exciting prospects.\n\n1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:59.460\n I mean, scale is a bit more boring, but it really works.\n\n1:16:59.460 --> 1:17:02.840\n And then maybe programs and discrete abstractions\n\n1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:04.840\n are a bit less developed.\n\n1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:07.840\n But clearly, I think they're quite exciting in terms\n\n1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:09.960\n of future for the field.\n\n1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:14.040\n Do you draw any insight wisdom from the 80s and expert\n\n1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:16.920\n systems and symbolic systems, symbolic computing?\n\n1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:20.760\n Do you ever go back to those reasoning, that kind of logic?\n\n1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:23.200\n Do you think that might make a comeback?\n\n1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:24.920\n You'll have to dust off those books?\n\n1:17:24.920 --> 1:17:31.320\n Yeah, I actually love actually adding more inductive biases.\n\n1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:34.280\n To me, the problem really is, what are you trying to solve?\n\n1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:37.440\n If what you're trying to solve is so important that try\n\n1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:42.480\n to solve it no matter what, then absolutely use rules,\n\n1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:45.240\n use domain knowledge, and then use\n\n1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:46.920\n a bit of the magic of machine learning\n\n1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:50.640\n to empower to make the system as the best system that\n\n1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:56.040\n will detect cancer or detect weather patterns, right?\n\n1:17:56.040 --> 1:17:59.240\n Or in terms of StarCraft, it also was a very big challenge.\n\n1:17:59.240 --> 1:18:01.920\n So I was definitely happy that if we\n\n1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:04.560\n had to cut a corner here and there,\n\n1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:07.040\n it could have been interesting to do.\n\n1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:09.240\n And in fact, in StarCraft, we start\n\n1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:11.640\n thinking about expert systems because it's a very,\n\n1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:12.800\n you know, you can define.\n\n1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.560\n I mean, people actually build StarCraft bots by thinking\n\n1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:20.240\n about those principles, like state machines and rule based.\n\n1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:22.240\n And then you could think of combining\n\n1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:25.560\n a bit of a rule based system, but that has also\n\n1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:28.600\n neural networks incorporated to make it generalize a bit\n\n1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:29.080\n better.\n\n1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:31.480\n So absolutely, I mean, we should definitely\n\n1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:32.840\n go back to those ideas.\n\n1:18:32.840 --> 1:18:35.440\n And anything that makes the problem simpler,\n\n1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:37.960\n as long as your problem is important, that's OK.\n\n1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:41.080\n And that's research driving a very important problem.\n\n1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:44.520\n And on the other hand, if you want to really focus\n\n1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.560\n on the limits of reinforcement learning,\n\n1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.720\n then of course, you must try not to look at imitation data\n\n1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:55.200\n or to look for some rules of the domain that would help a lot\n\n1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.960\n or even feature engineering, right?\n\n1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:00.720\n So this is a tension that depending on what you do,\n\n1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.280\n I think both ways are definitely fine.\n\n1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:06.760\n And I would never not do one or the other\n\n1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.840\n as long as what you're doing is important\n\n1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:10.000\n and needs to be solved, right?\n\n1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.440\n Right, so there's a bunch of different ideas\n\n1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.840\n that you developed that I really enjoy.\n\n1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:22.160\n But one is translating from image captioning,\n\n1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:27.480\n translating from image to text, just another beautiful idea,\n\n1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:33.160\n I think, that resonates throughout your work, actually.\n\n1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:35.080\n So the underlying nature of reality\n\n1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:38.760\n being language always, somehow.\n\n1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:42.480\n So what's the connection between images and text,\n\n1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:44.880\n or rather the visual world and the world\n\n1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:46.480\n of language in your view?\n\n1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:51.440\n Right, so I think a piece of research that's been central\n\n1:19:51.440 --> 1:19:54.320\n to, I would say, even extending into StarGraph\n\n1:19:54.320 --> 1:19:57.600\n is this idea of sequence to sequence learning,\n\n1:19:57.600 --> 1:19:59.800\n which what we really meant by that\n\n1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:03.440\n is that you can now really input anything\n\n1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:06.040\n to a neural network as the input x.\n\n1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:09.520\n And then the neural network will learn a function f\n\n1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:12.720\n that will take x as an input and produce any output y.\n\n1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:19.200\n And these x and y's don't need to be static or features,\n\n1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:22.200\n like fixed vectors or anything like that.\n\n1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:26.520\n It could be really sequences and now beyond data structures.\n\n1:20:26.520 --> 1:20:31.560\n So that paradigm was tested in a very interesting way\n\n1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:35.720\n when we moved from translating French to English\n\n1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.920\n to translating an image to its caption.\n\n1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:40.720\n But the beauty of it is that, really,\n\n1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:43.000\n and that's actually how it happened.\n\n1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.440\n I changed a line of code in this thing that\n\n1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:47.480\n was doing machine translation.\n\n1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:50.080\n And I came the next day, and I saw\n\n1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:54.160\n how it was producing captions that seemed like, oh my god,\n\n1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:55.960\n this is really, really working.\n\n1:20:55.960 --> 1:20:57.640\n And the principle is the same.\n\n1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:04.080\n So I think I don't see text, vision, speech, waveforms\n\n1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:09.000\n as something different as long as you basically\n\n1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:14.760\n learn a function that will vectorize these into.\n\n1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:16.640\n And then after we vectorize it, we\n\n1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:20.040\n can then use transformers, LSTMs, whatever\n\n1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:22.680\n the flavor of the month of the model is.\n\n1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.720\n And then as long as we have enough supervised data,\n\n1:21:25.720 --> 1:21:30.040\n really, this formula will work and will keep working,\n\n1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:31.800\n I believe, to some extent.\n\n1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:35.200\n Modulo these generalization issues that I mentioned before.\n\n1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:36.760\n But the task there is to vectorize,\n\n1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:39.840\n so to form a representation that's meaningful.\n\n1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:42.720\n And your intuition now, having worked with all this media,\n\n1:21:42.720 --> 1:21:46.520\n is that once you are able to form that representation,\n\n1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:51.280\n you could basically take any things, any sequence.\n\n1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:52.880\n Going back to StarCraft, is there\n\n1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:56.760\n limits on the length so that we didn't really\n\n1:21:56.760 --> 1:21:59.520\n touch on the long term aspect?\n\n1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:02.480\n How did you overcome the whole really long term\n\n1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:03.800\n aspect of things here?\n\n1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:05.200\n Is there some tricks?\n\n1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:08.680\n So the main trick, so StarCraft, if you\n\n1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:10.880\n look at absolutely every frame, you\n\n1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:12.600\n might think it's quite a long game.\n\n1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:18.400\n So we would have to multiply 22 times 60 seconds per minute\n\n1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:21.840\n times maybe at least 10 minutes per game on average.\n\n1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:25.640\n So there are quite a few frames.\n\n1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:30.200\n But the trick really was to only observe, in fact,\n\n1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.280\n which might be seen as a limitation,\n\n1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:35.160\n but it is also a computational advantage.\n\n1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:37.720\n Only observe when you act.\n\n1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:40.000\n And then what the neural network decides\n\n1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:44.680\n is what is the gap going to be until the next action.\n\n1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:48.080\n And if you look at most StarCraft games\n\n1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:51.920\n that we have in the data set that Blizzard provided,\n\n1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:56.000\n it turns out that most games are actually only,\n\n1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000\n I mean, it is still a long sequence,\n\n1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.160\n but it's maybe like 1,000 to 1,500 actions,\n\n1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:07.200\n which if you start looking at LSTMs, large LSTMs,\n\n1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:12.320\n transformers, it's not that difficult, especially\n\n1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:14.320\n if you have supervised learning.\n\n1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:16.240\n If you had to do it with reinforcement learning,\n\n1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:18.080\n the credit assignment problem, what\n\n1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:19.800\n is it in this game that made you win?\n\n1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:21.640\n That would be really difficult.\n\n1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:24.640\n But thankfully, because of imitation learning,\n\n1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:27.400\n we didn't have to deal with these directly.\n\n1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:29.600\n Although if we had to, we tried it.\n\n1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:31.840\n And what happened is you just take all your workers\n\n1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:33.280\n and attack with them.\n\n1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:36.080\n And that is kind of obvious in retrospect\n\n1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:38.120\n because you start trying random actions.\n\n1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:40.280\n One of the actions will be a worker\n\n1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:41.440\n that goes to the enemy base.\n\n1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:43.560\n And because it's self play, it's not\n\n1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.680\n going to know how to defend because it basically\n\n1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:47.000\n doesn't know almost anything.\n\n1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:50.320\n And eventually, what you develop is this take all workers\n\n1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:54.680\n and attack because the credit assignment issue in a rally\n\n1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:55.840\n is really, really hard.\n\n1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:57.600\n I do believe we could do better.\n\n1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:01.520\n And that's maybe a research challenge for the future.\n\n1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:04.160\n But yeah, even in StarCraft, the sequences\n\n1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:07.640\n are maybe 1,000, which I believe is\n\n1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:10.360\n within the realm of what transformers can do.\n\n1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:12.800\n Yeah, I guess the difference between StarCraft and Go\n\n1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:18.160\n is in Go and Chess, stuff starts happening right away.\n\n1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:22.240\n So there's not, yeah, it's pretty easy to self play.\n\n1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:24.560\n Not easy, but to self play, it's possible to develop\n\n1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:27.240\n reasonable strategies quickly as opposed to StarCraft.\n\n1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:30.600\n I mean, in Go, there's only 400 actions.\n\n1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:34.200\n But one action is what people would call the God action.\n\n1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:38.480\n That would be if you had expanded the whole search\n\n1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:40.840\n tree, that's the best action if you did minimax\n\n1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:42.800\n or whatever algorithm you would do if you\n\n1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:44.960\n had the computational capacity.\n\n1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:48.720\n But in StarCraft, 400 is minuscule.\n\n1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:51.960\n Like in 400, you couldn't even click\n\n1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:53.840\n on the pixels around a unit.\n\n1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:58.880\n So I think the problem there is in terms of action space size\n\n1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:01.640\n is way harder.\n\n1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.960\n And that search is impossible.\n\n1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:06.000\n So there's quite a few challenges indeed\n\n1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.640\n that make this kind of a step up in terms of machine learning.\n\n1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:13.560\n For humans, maybe playing StarCraft\n\n1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:16.000\n seems more intuitive because it looks real.\n\n1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.840\n I mean, the graphics and everything moves smoothly,\n\n1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:20.240\n whereas I don't know how to.\n\n1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.680\n I mean, Go is a game that I would really need to study.\n\n1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:23.920\n It feels quite complicated.\n\n1:25:23.920 --> 1:25:27.040\n But for machines, kind of maybe it's the reverse, yes.\n\n1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:30.240\n Which shows you the gap actually between deep learning\n\n1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:34.040\n and however the heck our brains work.\n\n1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:36.080\n So you developed a lot of really interesting ideas.\n\n1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:38.480\n It's interesting to just ask, what's\n\n1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:41.200\n your process of developing new ideas?\n\n1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:42.960\n Do you like brainstorming with others?\n\n1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:44.560\n Do you like thinking alone?\n\n1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.200\n Do you like, what was it, Ian Goodfellow said\n\n1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.840\n he came up with GANs after a few beers.\n\n1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:55.880\n He thinks beers are essential for coming up with new ideas.\n\n1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:59.160\n We had beers to decide to play another game of StarCraft\n\n1:25:59.160 --> 1:25:59.720\n after a week.\n\n1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:02.760\n So it's really similar to that story.\n\n1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:05.880\n Actually, I explained this in a DeepMind retreat.\n\n1:26:05.880 --> 1:26:08.000\n And I said, this is the same as the GAN story.\n\n1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:09.080\n I mean, we were in a bar.\n\n1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:10.920\n And we decided, let's play a GAN next week.\n\n1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:11.880\n And that's what happened.\n\n1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:13.600\n I feel like we're giving the wrong message\n\n1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:15.120\n to young undergrads.\n\n1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:15.760\n Yeah, I know.\n\n1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:18.320\n But in general, do you like brainstorming?\n\n1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:20.280\n Do you like thinking alone, working stuff out?\n\n1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:23.960\n So I think throughout the years, also, things changed.\n\n1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:29.320\n So initially, I was very fortunate to be\n\n1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.120\n with great minds like Jeff Hinton, Jeff Dean,\n\n1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:34.040\n Ilya Sutskever.\n\n1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:37.800\n I was really fortunate to join Brain at a very good time.\n\n1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:41.000\n So at that point, ideas, I was just\n\n1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.040\n brainstorming with my colleagues and learned a lot.\n\n1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.400\n And keep learning is actually something\n\n1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.160\n you should never stop doing.\n\n1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:51.520\n So learning implies reading papers and also\n\n1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:53.200\n discussing ideas with others.\n\n1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:56.680\n It's very hard at some point to not communicate\n\n1:26:56.680 --> 1:26:59.160\n that being reading a paper from someone\n\n1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:00.520\n or actually discussing.\n\n1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:04.680\n So definitely, that communication aspect\n\n1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.520\n needs to be there, whether it's written or oral.\n\n1:27:08.520 --> 1:27:12.840\n Nowadays, I'm also trying to be a bit more strategic\n\n1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:15.160\n about what research to do.\n\n1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:18.480\n So I was describing a little bit this tension\n\n1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:21.440\n between research for the sake of research,\n\n1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:23.000\n and then you have, on the other hand,\n\n1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.520\n applications that can drive the research.\n\n1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:28.560\n And honestly, the formula that has worked best for me\n\n1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:32.240\n is just find a hard problem and then\n\n1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:34.600\n try to see how research fits into it,\n\n1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:37.880\n how it doesn't fit into it, and then you must innovate.\n\n1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:43.040\n So I think machine translation drove sequence to sequence.\n\n1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:47.360\n Then maybe learning algorithms that had to,\n\n1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:50.560\n combinatorial algorithms led to pointer networks.\n\n1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:53.840\n StarCraft led to really scaling up imitation learning\n\n1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:55.520\n and the AlphaStarLeague.\n\n1:27:55.520 --> 1:27:58.360\n So that's been a formula that I personally like.\n\n1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:00.000\n But the other one is also valid.\n\n1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.760\n And I've seen it succeed a lot of the times\n\n1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:05.680\n where you just want to investigate model based\n\n1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:08.160\n RL as a research topic.\n\n1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:11.360\n And then you must then start to think, well,\n\n1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:12.160\n how are the tests?\n\n1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:14.240\n How are you going to test these ideas?\n\n1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:17.920\n You need a minimal environment to try things.\n\n1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:19.720\n You need to read a lot of papers and so on.\n\n1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.520\n And that's also very fun to do and something\n\n1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:24.000\n I've also done quite a few times,\n\n1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:28.920\n both at Brain, at DeepMind, and obviously as a PhD.\n\n1:28:28.920 --> 1:28:32.880\n So I think besides the ideas and discussions,\n\n1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:35.920\n I think it's important also because you start\n\n1:28:35.920 --> 1:28:40.200\n sort of guiding not only your own goals,\n\n1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:44.000\n but other people's goals to the next breakthrough.\n\n1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.400\n So you must really kind of understand this feasibility\n\n1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.400\n also, as we were discussing before,\n\n1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:53.960\n whether this domain is ready to be tackled or not.\n\n1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:55.480\n And you don't want to be too early.\n\n1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:57.080\n You obviously don't want to be too late.\n\n1:28:57.080 --> 1:29:00.520\n So it's really interesting, this strategic component\n\n1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:03.200\n of research, which I think as a grad student,\n\n1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:05.120\n I just had no idea.\n\n1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:07.400\n I just read papers and discussed ideas.\n\n1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:09.760\n And I think this has been maybe the major change.\n\n1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:13.520\n And I recommend people kind of feed forward\n\n1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:16.040\n to success how it looks like and try to backtrack,\n\n1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:18.680\n other than just kind of looking, oh, this looks cool.\n\n1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:19.320\n This looks cool.\n\n1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:21.080\n And then you do a bit of random work,\n\n1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:23.880\n which sometimes you stumble upon some interesting things.\n\n1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:27.440\n But in general, it's also good to plan a bit.\n\n1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:28.960\n Yeah, I like it.\n\n1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:31.960\n Especially like your approach of taking a really hard problem,\n\n1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:33.680\n stepping right in, and then being\n\n1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:37.840\n super skeptical about being able to solve the problem.\n\n1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.120\n I mean, there's a balance of both, right?\n\n1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:46.920\n There's a silly optimism and a critical sort of skepticism\n\n1:29:46.920 --> 1:29:49.000\n that's good to balance, which is why\n\n1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:52.400\n it's good to have a team of people that balance that.\n\n1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:53.880\n You don't do that on your own.\n\n1:29:53.880 --> 1:29:56.440\n You have both mentors that have seen,\n\n1:29:56.440 --> 1:29:59.680\n or you obviously want to chat and discuss\n\n1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:00.920\n whether it's the right time.\n\n1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:03.960\n I mean, Demis came in 2014.\n\n1:30:03.960 --> 1:30:06.600\n And he said, maybe in a bit we'll do StarCraft.\n\n1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:08.240\n And maybe he knew.\n\n1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:11.200\n And I'm just following his lead, which is great,\n\n1:30:11.200 --> 1:30:12.600\n because he's brilliant, right?\n\n1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:17.280\n So these things are obviously quite important,\n\n1:30:17.280 --> 1:30:22.280\n that you want to be surrounded by people who are diverse.\n\n1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:23.960\n They have their knowledge.\n\n1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:26.640\n There's also important to, I mean,\n\n1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:30.960\n I've learned a lot from people who actually have an idea\n\n1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:32.440\n that I might not think it's good.\n\n1:30:32.440 --> 1:30:34.880\n But if I give them the space to try it,\n\n1:30:34.880 --> 1:30:37.080\n I've been proven wrong many, many times as well.\n\n1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:38.200\n So that's great.\n\n1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:42.760\n I think your colleagues are more important than yourself,\n\n1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:43.480\n I think.\n\n1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:44.480\n Sure.\n\n1:30:44.480 --> 1:30:48.600\n Now let's real quick talk about another impossible problem,\n\n1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:49.560\n AGI.\n\n1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:50.280\n Right.\n\n1:30:50.280 --> 1:30:52.680\n What do you think it takes to build a system that's\n\n1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:54.080\n human level intelligence?\n\n1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:56.400\n We talked a little bit about the Turing test, StarCraft.\n\n1:30:56.400 --> 1:30:58.960\n All of these have echoes of general intelligence.\n\n1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:01.400\n But if you think about just something\n\n1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:03.400\n that you would sit back and say, wow,\n\n1:31:03.400 --> 1:31:06.720\n this is really something that resembles\n\n1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.800\n human level intelligence.\n\n1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.520\n What do you think it takes to build that?\n\n1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:17.160\n So I find that AGI oftentimes is maybe not very well defined.\n\n1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:20.520\n So what I'm trying to then come up with for myself\n\n1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:25.040\n is what would be a result look like that you would start\n\n1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:28.640\n to believe that you would have agents or neural nets that\n\n1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:31.800\n no longer overfeed to a single task,\n\n1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:37.840\n but actually learn the skill of learning, so to speak.\n\n1:31:37.840 --> 1:31:40.480\n And that actually is a field that I\n\n1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:43.560\n am fascinated by, which is the learning to learn,\n\n1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.120\n or meta learning, which is about no longer learning\n\n1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:48.680\n about a single domain.\n\n1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:51.040\n So you can think about the learning algorithm\n\n1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:52.680\n itself is general.\n\n1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:56.800\n So the same formula we applied for AlphaStar or StarCraft,\n\n1:31:56.800 --> 1:31:59.440\n we can now apply to almost any video game,\n\n1:31:59.440 --> 1:32:03.520\n or you could apply to many other problems and domains.\n\n1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:07.040\n But the algorithm is what's generalizing.\n\n1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:09.640\n But the neural network, those weights\n\n1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:12.120\n are useless even to play another race.\n\n1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:15.400\n I train a network to play very well at Protos versus Protos.\n\n1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:17.680\n I need to throw away those weights.\n\n1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.640\n If I want to play now Terran versus Terran,\n\n1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:23.720\n I would need to retrain a network from scratch\n\n1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:24.800\n with the same algorithm.\n\n1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:26.000\n That's beautiful.\n\n1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.640\n But the network itself will not be useful.\n\n1:32:28.640 --> 1:32:32.840\n So I think if I see an approach that\n\n1:32:32.840 --> 1:32:38.040\n can absorb or start solving new problems without the need\n\n1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:40.280\n to kind of restart the process, I\n\n1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:42.600\n think that, to me, would be a nice way\n\n1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:45.600\n to define some form of AGI.\n\n1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:48.120\n Again, I don't know the grandiose like age.\n\n1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:50.600\n I mean, should Turing tests be solved before AGI?\n\n1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:51.720\n I mean, I don't know.\n\n1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:54.760\n I think concretely, I would like to see clearly\n\n1:32:54.760 --> 1:32:57.560\n that meta learning happen, meaning\n\n1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:01.320\n that there is an architecture or a network that\n\n1:33:01.320 --> 1:33:04.920\n as it sees new problem or new data, it solves it.\n\n1:33:04.920 --> 1:33:08.240\n And to make it kind of a benchmark,\n\n1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:09.800\n it should solve it at the same speed\n\n1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:11.400\n that we do solve new problems.\n\n1:33:11.400 --> 1:33:13.520\n When I define you a new object and you\n\n1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:16.240\n have to recognize it, when you start playing a new game,\n\n1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:17.480\n you played all the Atari games.\n\n1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:19.360\n But now you play a new Atari game.\n\n1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:22.000\n Well, you're going to be pretty quickly pretty good\n\n1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:22.560\n at the game.\n\n1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:25.840\n So that's perhaps what's the domain\n\n1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:28.120\n and what's the exact benchmark is a bit difficult.\n\n1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.760\n I think as a community, we might need\n\n1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:32.600\n to do some work to define it.\n\n1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.720\n But I think this first step, I could\n\n1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.840\n see it happen relatively soon.\n\n1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:40.600\n But then the whole what AGI means and so on,\n\n1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:43.120\n I am a bit more confused about what\n\n1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:44.800\n I think people mean different things.\n\n1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:48.680\n There's an emotional, psychological level\n\n1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:53.080\n that like even the Turing test, passing the Turing test\n\n1:33:53.080 --> 1:33:55.840\n is something that we just pass judgment on as human beings\n\n1:33:55.840 --> 1:34:03.560\n what it means to be as a dog in AGI system.\n\n1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:04.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:07.520\n What level, what does it mean, what does it mean?\n\n1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:08.960\n But I like the generalization.\n\n1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.680\n And maybe as a community, we converge\n\n1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:14.960\n towards a group of domains that are sufficiently far away.\n\n1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:16.560\n That would be really damn impressive\n\n1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:18.280\n if it was able to generalize.\n\n1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:21.360\n So perhaps not as close as Protoss and Zerg,\n\n1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:22.720\n but like Wikipedia.\n\n1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:23.600\n That would be a step.\n\n1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:26.400\n Yeah, that would be a good step and then a really good step.\n\n1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:30.800\n But then like from StarCraft to Wikipedia and back.\n\n1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:31.880\n Yeah, that kind of thing.\n\n1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:34.200\n And that feels also quite hard and far.\n\n1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:38.200\n But I think as long as you put the benchmark out,\n\n1:34:38.200 --> 1:34:41.080\n as we discovered, for instance, with ImageNet,\n\n1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:43.120\n then tremendous progress can be had.\n\n1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:46.360\n So I think maybe there's a lack of benchmark,\n\n1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:49.520\n but I'm sure we'll find one and the community will then\n\n1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:52.360\n work towards that.\n\n1:34:52.360 --> 1:34:56.920\n And then beyond what AGI might mean or would imply,\n\n1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:01.040\n I really am hopeful to see basically machine learning\n\n1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:05.280\n or AI just scaling up and helping people\n\n1:35:05.280 --> 1:35:08.640\n that might not have the resources to hire an assistant\n\n1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:13.800\n or that they might not even know what the weather is like.\n\n1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:18.000\n So I think in terms of the positive impact of AI,\n\n1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:22.440\n I think that's maybe what we should also not lose focus.\n\n1:35:22.440 --> 1:35:23.960\n The research community building AGI,\n\n1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:25.520\n I mean, that's a real nice goal.\n\n1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:28.480\n But I think the way that DeepMind puts it is,\n\n1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:30.760\n and then use it to solve everything else.\n\n1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:33.440\n So I think we should paralyze.\n\n1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:36.160\n Yeah, we shouldn't forget about all the positive things\n\n1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.000\n that are actually coming out of AI already\n\n1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.600\n and are going to be coming out.\n\n1:35:40.600 --> 1:35:41.600\n Right.\n\n1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:45.400\n But on that note, let me ask relative\n\n1:35:45.400 --> 1:35:47.760\n to popular perception, do you have\n\n1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:49.640\n any worry about the existential threat\n\n1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:53.200\n of artificial intelligence in the near or far future\n\n1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:55.080\n that some people have?\n\n1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:58.080\n I think in the near future, I'm skeptical.\n\n1:35:58.080 --> 1:35:59.280\n So I hope I'm not wrong.\n\n1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:04.720\n But I'm not concerned, but I appreciate efforts,\n\n1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:07.760\n ongoing efforts, and even like whole research\n\n1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:10.720\n field on AI safety emerging and in conferences and so on.\n\n1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:12.560\n I think that's great.\n\n1:36:12.560 --> 1:36:16.200\n In the long term, I really hope we just\n\n1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:19.120\n can simply have the benefits outweigh\n\n1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:20.600\n the potential dangers.\n\n1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:23.400\n I am hopeful for that.\n\n1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:27.400\n But also, we must remain vigilant to monitor and assess\n\n1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:32.640\n whether the tradeoffs are there and we have enough also lead\n\n1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:37.720\n time to prevent or to redirect our efforts if need be.\n\n1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:41.440\n But I'm quite optimistic about the technology\n\n1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:45.000\n and definitely more fearful of other threats\n\n1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:48.600\n in terms of planetary level at this point.\n\n1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:52.520\n But obviously, that's the one I have more power on.\n\n1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.280\n So clearly, I do start thinking more and more about this.\n\n1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:00.840\n And it's grown in me actually to start reading more\n\n1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:04.120\n about AI safety, which is a field that so far I have not\n\n1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:05.360\n really contributed to.\n\n1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.720\n But maybe there's something to be done there as well.\n\n1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:09.280\n I think it's really important.\n\n1:37:09.280 --> 1:37:11.440\n I talk about this with a few folks.\n\n1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:14.800\n But it's important to ask you and shove it in your head\n\n1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:18.040\n because you're at the leading edge of actually what\n\n1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:19.880\n people are excited about in AI.\n\n1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:22.800\n The work with AlphaStar, it's arguably\n\n1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:25.400\n at the very cutting edge of the kind of thing\n\n1:37:25.400 --> 1:37:27.160\n that people are afraid of.\n\n1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:31.640\n And so you speaking to that fact and that we're actually\n\n1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:33.520\n quite far away to the kind of thing\n\n1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:35.160\n that people might be afraid of.\n\n1:37:35.160 --> 1:37:38.320\n But it's still worthwhile to think about.\n\n1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:43.480\n And it's also good that you're not as worried\n\n1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:45.720\n and you're also open to thinking about it.\n\n1:37:45.720 --> 1:37:46.560\n There's two aspects.\n\n1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:47.720\n I mean, me not being worried.\n\n1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:53.880\n But obviously, we should prepare for things\n\n1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.800\n that could go wrong, misuse of the technologies\n\n1:37:56.800 --> 1:37:58.360\n as with any technologies.\n\n1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:02.400\n So I think there's always trade offs.\n\n1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:06.800\n And as a society, we've kind of solved this to some extent\n\n1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:07.360\n in the past.\n\n1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:10.720\n So I'm hoping that by having the researchers\n\n1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:14.120\n and the whole community brainstorm and come up\n\n1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:16.960\n with interesting solutions to the new things that\n\n1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:20.320\n will happen in the future, that we can still also push\n\n1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:23.000\n the research to the avenue that I think\n\n1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.800\n is kind of the greatest avenue, which is\n\n1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:27.760\n to understand intelligence.\n\n1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:29.920\n How are we doing what we're doing?\n\n1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:32.560\n And obviously, from a scientific standpoint,\n\n1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:37.000\n that is kind of my personal drive of all the time\n\n1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000\n that I spend doing what I'm doing, really.\n\n1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.960\n Where do you see the deep learning as a field heading?\n\n1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:46.720\n Where do you think the next big breakthrough might be?\n\n1:38:46.720 --> 1:38:49.880\n So I think deep learning, I discussed a little of this\n\n1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:50.720\n before.\n\n1:38:50.720 --> 1:38:54.000\n Deep learning has to be combined with some form\n\n1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.680\n of discretization, program synthesis.\n\n1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.240\n I think that's kind of as a research in itself\n\n1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.000\n is an interesting topic to expand and start\n\n1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.080\n doing more research.\n\n1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.080\n And then as kind of what will deep learning\n\n1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:08.560\n enable to do in the future?\n\n1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:11.480\n I don't think that's going to be what's going to happen this year.\n\n1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:16.480\n But also this idea of starting not to throw away all the weights,\n\n1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:18.840\n that this idea of learning to learn\n\n1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:23.400\n and really having these agents not having\n\n1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:24.960\n to restart their weights.\n\n1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:29.760\n And you can have an agent that is kind of solving or classifying\n\n1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:32.760\n images on ImageNet, but also generating speech\n\n1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:34.680\n if you ask it to generate some speech.\n\n1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:39.760\n And it should really be kind of almost the same network,\n\n1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:41.760\n but it might not be a neural network.\n\n1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:44.240\n It might be a neural network with an optimization\n\n1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:45.600\n algorithm attached to it.\n\n1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:49.280\n But I think this idea of generalization to new task\n\n1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:52.160\n is something that we first must define good benchmarks.\n\n1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:54.680\n But then I think that's going to be exciting.\n\n1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:56.480\n And I'm not sure how close we are.\n\n1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:00.880\n But I think if you have a very limited domain,\n\n1:40:00.880 --> 1:40:02.800\n I think we can start doing some progress.\n\n1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:07.200\n And much like how we did a lot of programs in computer vision,\n\n1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:09.040\n we should start thinking.\n\n1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:12.720\n I really like a talk that Leon Buto gave at ICML\n\n1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:16.800\n a few years ago, which is this train test paradigm should\n\n1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:17.920\n be broken.\n\n1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:23.160\n We should stop thinking about a training set and a test set.\n\n1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:26.640\n And these are closed things that are untouchable.\n\n1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.200\n I think we should go beyond these.\n\n1:40:28.200 --> 1:40:30.840\n And in meta learning, we call these the meta training\n\n1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:35.320\n set and the meta test set, which is really thinking about,\n\n1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:39.040\n if I know about ImageNet, why would that network not\n\n1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:41.320\n work on MNIST, which is a much simpler problem?\n\n1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.560\n But right now, it really doesn't.\n\n1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:46.200\n But it just feels wrong.\n\n1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:50.960\n So I think that's kind of the, on the application\n\n1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.960\n or the benchmark sites, we probably\n\n1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:56.520\n will see quite a few more interest and progress\n\n1:40:56.520 --> 1:41:00.240\n and hopefully people defining new and exciting challenges\n\n1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:00.960\n really.\n\n1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.160\n Do you have any hope or interest in knowledge graphs\n\n1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:05.280\n within this context?\n\n1:41:05.280 --> 1:41:08.160\n So this kind of constructing graph.\n\n1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:10.480\n So going back to graphs.\n\n1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:12.120\n Well, neural networks and graphs.\n\n1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:14.840\n But I mean, a different kind of knowledge graph,\n\n1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:18.000\n sort of like semantic graphs or those concepts.\n\n1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:18.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.520\n So I think the idea of graphs is,\n\n1:41:23.520 --> 1:41:26.680\n so I've been quite interested in sequences first and then\n\n1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:29.720\n more interesting or different data structures like graphs.\n\n1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:33.960\n And I've studied graph neural networks in the last three\n\n1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:34.520\n years or so.\n\n1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:37.680\n I found these models just very interesting\n\n1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:42.160\n from deep learning sites standpoint.\n\n1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:45.840\n But then why do we want these models\n\n1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:47.280\n and why would we use them?\n\n1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:48.640\n What's the application?\n\n1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:51.320\n What's kind of the killer application of graphs?\n\n1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:58.520\n And perhaps if we could extract a knowledge graph\n\n1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:01.680\n from Wikipedia automatically, that\n\n1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:04.680\n would be interesting because then these graphs have\n\n1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:07.920\n this very interesting structure that also is a bit more\n\n1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:11.560\n compatible with this idea of programs and deep learning\n\n1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:14.360\n kind of working together, jumping neighborhoods\n\n1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:14.840\n and so on.\n\n1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:17.080\n You could imagine defining some primitives\n\n1:42:17.080 --> 1:42:18.800\n to go around graphs, right?\n\n1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:23.720\n So I think I really like the idea of a knowledge graph.\n\n1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:29.640\n And in fact, when we started or as part of the research\n\n1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:31.960\n we did for StarCraft, I thought, wouldn't it\n\n1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:38.000\n be cool to give the graph of all these buildings that\n\n1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.440\n depend on each other and units that have prerequisites\n\n1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:42.440\n of being built by that.\n\n1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:45.680\n And so this is information that the network\n\n1:42:45.680 --> 1:42:46.920\n can learn and extract.\n\n1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:50.120\n But it would have been great to see\n\n1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:53.880\n or to think of really StarCraft as a giant graph that even\n\n1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:57.040\n also as the game evolves, you start taking branches\n\n1:42:57.040 --> 1:42:57.960\n and so on.\n\n1:42:57.960 --> 1:42:59.920\n And we did a bit of research on these,\n\n1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:04.080\n nothing too relevant, but I really like the idea.\n\n1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:06.360\n And it has elements that are something\n\n1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:08.840\n you also worked with in terms of visualizing your networks.\n\n1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:13.280\n It has elements of having human interpretable,\n\n1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:15.840\n being able to generate knowledge representations that\n\n1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:18.640\n are human interpretable that maybe human experts can then\n\n1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:20.960\n tweak or at least understand.\n\n1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:22.880\n So there's a lot of interesting aspect there.\n\n1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:25.600\n And for me personally, I'm just a huge fan of Wikipedia.\n\n1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:29.360\n And it's a shame that our neural networks aren't\n\n1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:31.600\n taking advantage of all the structured knowledge that's\n\n1:43:31.600 --> 1:43:32.400\n on the web.\n\n1:43:32.400 --> 1:43:34.920\n What's next for you?\n\n1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:36.400\n What's next for DeepMind?\n\n1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:39.680\n What are you excited about for AlphaStar?\n\n1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:43.560\n Yeah, so I think the obvious next steps\n\n1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.040\n would be to apply AlphaStar to other races.\n\n1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:51.640\n I mean, that sort of shows that the algorithm works\n\n1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:56.120\n because we wouldn't want to have created by mistake something\n\n1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:58.840\n in the architecture that happens to work for Protoss\n\n1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:00.120\n but not for other races.\n\n1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:03.480\n So as verification, I think that's an obvious next step\n\n1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:05.640\n that we are working on.\n\n1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:11.440\n And then I would like to see so agents and players can\n\n1:44:11.440 --> 1:44:13.920\n specialize on different skill sets that\n\n1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:15.920\n allow them to be very good.\n\n1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:19.480\n I think we've seen AlphaStar understanding very well\n\n1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:22.360\n when to take battles and when to not to do that.\n\n1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:24.880\n Also very good at micromanagement\n\n1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:27.520\n and moving the units around and so on.\n\n1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:30.400\n And also very good at producing nonstop and trading off\n\n1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:33.360\n economy with building units.\n\n1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.520\n But I have not perhaps seen as much\n\n1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:39.000\n as I would like this idea of the poker idea\n\n1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:40.360\n that you mentioned, right?\n\n1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.600\n I'm not sure StarCraft or AlphaStar\n\n1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:47.160\n rather has developed a very deep understanding of what\n\n1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:50.120\n the opponent is doing and reacting to that\n\n1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:54.080\n and sort of trying to trick the player to do something else\n\n1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:55.440\n or that.\n\n1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:58.320\n So this kind of reasoning, I would like to see more.\n\n1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:01.600\n So I think purely from a research standpoint,\n\n1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:03.920\n there's perhaps also quite a few things\n\n1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:06.000\n to be done there in the domain of StarCraft.\n\n1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.320\n Yeah, in the domain of games, I've\n\n1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:11.960\n seen some interesting work in even auctions,\n\n1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:15.160\n manipulating other players, sort of forming a belief state\n\n1:45:15.160 --> 1:45:17.160\n and just messing with people.\n\n1:45:17.160 --> 1:45:18.800\n Yeah, it's called theory of mind, I guess.\n\n1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:20.080\n Theory of mind, yeah.\n\n1:45:20.080 --> 1:45:21.440\n So it's a fascinating.\n\n1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:24.400\n Theory of mind on StarCraft is kind of they're\n\n1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.080\n really made for each other.\n\n1:45:26.080 --> 1:45:29.840\n So that would be very exciting to see those techniques apply\n\n1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:32.040\n to StarCraft or perhaps StarCraft\n\n1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:33.280\n driving new techniques, right?\n\n1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:36.600\n As I said, this is always the tension between the two.\n\n1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:38.800\n Well, Orel, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:39.320\n Awesome.\n\n1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:40.280\n It was great to be here.\n\n1:45:40.280 --> 1:46:00.600\n Thanks.\n\n"
