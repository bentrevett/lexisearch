learning based vehicle automation company.\n\n00:07.360 --> 00:10.160\n He is most certainly an outspoken personality\n\n00:10.160 --> 00:13.120\n in the field of AI and technology in general.\n\n00:13.120 --> 00:16.200\n He first gained recognition for being the first person\n\n00:16.200 --> 00:18.360\n to carry or unlock an iPhone.\n\n00:18.360 --> 00:21.240\n And since then, he's done quite a few interesting things\n\n00:21.240 --> 00:24.360\n at the intersection of hardware and software.\n\n00:24.360 --> 00:27.400\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:27.400 --> 00:29.560\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:29.560 --> 00:32.880\n give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon,\n\n00:32.880 --> 00:34.880\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n00:34.880 --> 00:39.120\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n00:39.120 --> 00:40.960\n And I'd like to give a special thank you\n\n00:40.960 --> 00:43.240\n to Jennifer from Canada\n\n00:43.240 --> 00:45.840\n for her support of the podcast on Patreon.\n\n00:45.840 --> 00:47.680\n Merci beaucoup, Jennifer.\n\n00:47.680 --> 00:50.600\n She's been a friend and an engineering colleague\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:52.760\n for many years since I was in grad school.\n\n00:52.760 --> 00:54.320\n Your support means a lot\n\n00:54.320 --> 00:57.880\n and inspires me to keep this series going.\n\n00:57.880 --> 01:01.560\n And now, here's my conversation with George Hotz.\n\n01:02.680 --> 01:04.840\n Do you think we're living in a simulation?\n\n01:06.440 --> 01:10.040\n Yes, but it may be unfalsifiable.\n\n01:10.040 --> 01:12.400\n What do you mean by unfalsifiable?\n\n01:12.400 --> 01:16.800\n So if the simulation is designed in such a way\n\n01:16.800 --> 01:19.600\n that they did like a formal proof\n\n01:19.600 --> 01:22.280\n to show that no information can get in and out,\n\n01:22.280 --> 01:24.040\n and if their hardware is designed\n\n01:24.040 --> 01:25.960\n for the anything in the simulation\n\n01:25.960 --> 01:27.840\n to always keep the hardware in spec,\n\n01:27.840 --> 01:29.440\n it may be impossible to prove\n\n01:29.440 --> 01:31.280\n whether we're in a simulation or not.\n\n01:32.560 --> 01:35.640\n So they've designed it such that it's a closed system\n\n01:35.640 --> 01:37.160\n you can't get outside the system.\n\n01:37.160 --> 01:38.760\n Well, maybe it's one of three worlds.\n\n01:38.760 --> 01:41.360\n We're either in a simulation which can be exploited,\n\n01:41.360 --> 01:44.160\n we're in a simulation which not only can't be exploited,\n\n01:44.160 --> 01:46.400\n but like the same thing's true about VMs.\n\n01:46.400 --> 01:48.120\n A really well designed VM,\n\n01:48.120 --> 01:51.360\n you can't even detect if you're in a VM or not.\n\n01:51.360 --> 01:52.480\n That's brilliant.\n\n01:52.480 --> 01:56.760\n So the simulation is running on a virtual machine.\n\n01:56.760 --> 01:59.400\n But now in reality, all VMs have ways to detect.\n\n01:59.400 --> 02:00.240\n That's the point.\n\n02:00.240 --> 02:04.800\n I mean, you've done quite a bit of hacking yourself.\n\n02:04.800 --> 02:08.600\n So you should know that really any complicated system\n\n02:08.600 --> 02:10.960\n will have ways in and out.\n\n02:10.960 --> 02:14.200\n So this isn't necessarily true going forward.\n\n02:15.240 --> 02:18.040\n I spent my time away from Comma,\n\n02:18.040 --> 02:21.800\n I learned Coq, it's a dependently typed,\n\n02:21.800 --> 02:24.320\n it's a language for writing math proofs in.\n\n02:24.320 --> 02:28.160\n And if you write code that compiles in a language like that,\n\n02:28.160 --> 02:30.800\n it is correct by definition.\n\n02:30.800 --> 02:33.520\n The types check its correctness.\n\n02:33.520 --> 02:34.960\n So it's possible that the simulation\n\n02:34.960 --> 02:39.600\n is written in a language like this, in which case, yeah.\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:42.640\n Yeah, but that can't be sufficiently expressive\n\n02:42.640 --> 02:43.720\n a language like that.\n\n02:43.720 --> 02:44.560\n Oh, it can.\n\n02:44.560 --> 02:45.400\n It can be?\n\n02:45.400 --> 02:46.240\n Oh, yeah.\n\n02:46.240 --> 02:48.880\n Okay, well, so all right, so.\n\n02:48.880 --> 02:50.600\n The simulation doesn't have to be Turing complete\n\n02:50.600 --> 02:52.280\n if it has a scheduled end date.\n\n02:52.280 --> 02:54.560\n Looks like it does actually with entropy.\n\n02:54.560 --> 02:58.560\n I mean, I don't think that a simulation\n\n02:58.560 --> 03:02.200\n that results in something as complicated as the universe\n\n03:03.040 --> 03:07.280\n would have a form of proof of correctness, right?\n\n03:08.240 --> 03:09.800\n It's possible, of course.\n\n03:09.800 --> 03:12.720\n We have no idea how good their tooling is.\n\n03:12.720 --> 03:14.600\n And we have no idea how complicated\n\n03:14.600 --> 03:16.240\n the universe computer really is.\n\n03:16.240 --> 03:17.880\n It may be quite simple.\n\n03:17.880 --> 03:19.640\n It's just very large, right?\n\n03:19.640 --> 03:22.120\n It's very, it's definitely very large.\n\n03:22.120 --> 03:24.440\n But the fundamental rules might be super simple.\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:26.200\n Yeah, Conway's getting a life kind of stuff.\n\n03:26.200 --> 03:27.040\n Right.\n\n03:28.040 --> 03:30.280\n So if you could hack,\n\n03:30.280 --> 03:32.360\n so imagine a simulation that is hackable,\n\n03:32.360 --> 03:33.600\n if you could hack it,\n\n03:35.040 --> 03:37.880\n what would you change about the,\n\n03:37.880 --> 03:40.520\n like how would you approach hacking a simulation?\n\n03:41.640 --> 03:44.320\n The reason I gave that talk.\n\n03:44.320 --> 03:46.640\n By the way, I'm not familiar with the talk you gave.\n\n03:46.640 --> 03:50.120\n I just read that you talked about escaping the simulation\n\n03:50.120 --> 03:51.240\n or something like that.\n\n03:51.240 --> 03:53.640\n So maybe you can tell me a little bit about the theme\n\n03:53.640 --> 03:55.320\n and the message there too.\n\n03:55.320 --> 03:57.640\n It wasn't a very practical talk\n\n03:57.640 --> 04:00.560\n about how to actually escape a simulation.\n\n04:00.560 --> 04:03.280\n It was more about a way of restructuring\n\n04:03.280 --> 04:05.080\n an us versus them narrative.\n\n04:05.080 --> 04:05.920\n If\n\n04:08.160 --> 04:12.320\n we continue on the path we're going with technology,\n\n04:12.320 --> 04:14.120\n I think we're in big trouble,\n\n04:14.120 --> 04:16.720\n like as a species and not just as a species,\n\n04:16.720 --> 04:19.440\n but even as me as an individual member of the species.\n\n04:19.440 --> 04:22.080\n So if we could change rhetoric\n\n04:22.080 --> 04:24.880\n to be more like to think upwards,\n\n04:26.200 --> 04:29.040\n like to think about that we're in a simulation\n\n04:29.040 --> 04:30.320\n and how we could get out,\n\n04:30.320 --> 04:32.560\n already we'd be on the right path.\n\n04:32.560 --> 04:34.760\n What you actually do once you do that,\n\n04:34.760 --> 04:37.320\n well, I assume I would have acquired way more intelligence\n\n04:37.320 --> 04:38.440\n in the process of doing that.\n\n04:38.440 --> 04:39.720\n So I'll just ask that.\n\n04:39.720 --> 04:42.040\n So the thinking upwards,\n\n04:42.040 --> 04:43.720\n what kind of ideas,\n\n04:43.720 --> 04:44.800\n what kind of breakthrough ideas\n\n04:44.800 --> 04:47.280\n do you think thinking in that way could inspire?\n\n04:47.280 --> 04:49.760\n And why did you say upwards?\n\n04:49.760 --> 04:50.600\n Upwards.\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:51.440\n Into space?\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:54.040\n Are you thinking sort of exploration in all forms?\n\n04:54.040 --> 04:56.120\n The space narrative\n\n04:57.400 --> 04:59.800\n that held for the modernist generation\n\n04:59.800 --> 05:02.520\n doesn't hold as well for the postmodern generation.\n\n05:04.480 --> 05:05.400\n What's the space narrative?\n\n05:05.400 --> 05:06.440\n Are we talking about the same space,\n\n05:06.440 --> 05:07.280\n the three dimensional space?\n\n05:07.280 --> 05:08.720\n No, no, no, space, like going on space,\n\n05:08.720 --> 05:09.960\n like building like Elon Musk,\n\n05:09.960 --> 05:11.080\n like we're going to build rockets,\n\n05:11.080 --> 05:11.960\n we're going to go to Mars,\n\n05:11.960 --> 05:13.440\n we're going to colonize the universe.\n\n05:13.440 --> 05:14.640\n And the narrative you're referring,\n\n05:14.640 --> 05:15.960\n I was born in the Soviet Union,\n\n05:15.960 --> 05:17.960\n you're referring to the race to space.\n\n05:17.960 --> 05:18.880\n The race to space, yeah.\n\n05:18.880 --> 05:19.720\n Explore, okay.\n\n05:19.720 --> 05:21.760\n That was a great modernist narrative.\n\n05:21.760 --> 05:23.320\n Yeah.\n\n05:23.320 --> 05:26.640\n It doesn't seem to hold the same weight in today's culture.\n\n05:27.640 --> 05:32.120\n I'm hoping for good postmodern narratives that replace it.\n\n05:32.120 --> 05:35.520\n So let's think, so you work a lot with AI.\n\n05:35.520 --> 05:39.040\n So AI is one formulation of that narrative.\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:40.040\n There could be also,\n\n05:40.040 --> 05:42.280\n I don't know how much you do in VR and AR.\n\n05:42.280 --> 05:43.120\n Yeah.\n\n05:43.120 --> 05:45.120\n That's another, I know less about it,\n\n05:45.120 --> 05:47.600\n but every time I play with it in our research,\n\n05:47.600 --> 05:49.600\n it's fascinating, that virtual world.\n\n05:49.600 --> 05:51.800\n Are you interested in the virtual world?\n\n05:51.800 --> 05:54.160\n I would like to move to virtual reality.\n\n05:55.280 --> 05:56.400\n In terms of your work?\n\n05:56.400 --> 05:58.720\n No, I would like to physically move there.\n\n05:58.720 --> 06:00.200\n The apartment I can rent in the cloud\n\n06:00.200 --> 06:01.120\n is way better than the apartment\n\n06:01.120 --> 06:03.200\n I can rent in the real world.\n\n06:03.200 --> 06:04.720\n Well, it's all relative, isn't it?\n\n06:04.720 --> 06:07.240\n Because others will have very nice apartments too,\n\n06:07.240 --> 06:09.080\n so you'll be inferior in the virtual world as well.\n\n06:09.080 --> 06:11.280\n No, but that's not how I view the world, right?\n\n06:11.280 --> 06:12.400\n I don't view the world,\n\n06:12.400 --> 06:15.600\n I mean, it's a very almost zero sum ish way\n\n06:15.600 --> 06:16.440\n to view the world.\n\n06:16.440 --> 06:18.760\n Say like, my great apartment isn't great\n\n06:18.760 --> 06:20.360\n because my neighbor has one too.\n\n06:20.360 --> 06:21.600\n No, my great apartment is great\n\n06:21.600 --> 06:24.280\n because look at this dishwasher, man.\n\n06:24.280 --> 06:26.640\n You just touch the dish and it's washed, right?\n\n06:26.640 --> 06:28.680\n And that is great in and of itself\n\n06:28.680 --> 06:30.080\n if I have the only apartment\n\n06:30.080 --> 06:31.480\n or if everybody had the apartment.\n\n06:31.480 --> 06:32.360\n I don't care.\n\n06:32.360 --> 06:34.720\n So you have fundamental gratitude.\n\n06:34.720 --> 06:39.080\n The world first learned of George Hots\n\n06:39.080 --> 06:42.240\n in August 2007, maybe before then,\n\n06:42.240 --> 06:44.040\n but certainly in August 2007\n\n06:44.040 --> 06:46.760\n when you were the first person to unlock,\n\n06:46.760 --> 06:48.840\n carry unlock an iPhone.\n\n06:48.840 --> 06:50.480\n How did you get into hacking?\n\n06:50.480 --> 06:51.520\n What was the first system\n\n06:51.520 --> 06:55.000\n you discovered vulnerabilities for and broke into?\n\n06:56.200 --> 07:01.200\n So that was really kind of the first thing.\n\n07:01.600 --> 07:06.600\n I had a book in 2006 called Grey Hat Hacking.\n\n07:06.600 --> 07:11.600\n And I guess I realized that if you acquired\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:15.320\n these sort of powers, you could control the world.\n\n07:16.160 --> 07:18.960\n But I didn't really know that much\n\n07:18.960 --> 07:20.560\n about computers back then.\n\n07:20.560 --> 07:22.160\n I started with electronics.\n\n07:22.160 --> 07:24.200\n The first iPhone hack was physical.\n\n07:24.200 --> 07:25.040\n Cardware.\n\n07:25.040 --> 07:28.160\n You had to open it up and pull an address line high.\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:29.960\n And it was because I didn't really know\n\n07:29.960 --> 07:31.360\n about software exploitation.\n\n07:31.360 --> 07:32.960\n I learned that all in the next few years\n\n07:32.960 --> 07:33.920\n and I got very good at it.\n\n07:33.920 --> 07:37.640\n But back then I knew about like how memory chips\n\n07:37.640 --> 07:38.960\n are connected to processors and stuff.\n\n07:38.960 --> 07:40.960\n You knew about software and programming.\n\n07:40.960 --> 07:43.160\n You just didn't know.\n\n07:43.160 --> 07:44.000\n Oh really?\n\n07:44.000 --> 07:46.800\n So your view of the world and computers\n\n07:46.800 --> 07:49.280\n was physical, was hardware.\n\n07:49.280 --> 07:51.760\n Actually, if you read the code that I released\n\n07:51.760 --> 07:55.720\n with that in August 2007, it's atrocious.\n\n07:55.720 --> 07:56.720\n What language was it?\n\n07:56.720 --> 07:57.560\n C.\n\n07:57.560 --> 07:58.400\n C, nice.\n\n07:58.400 --> 08:01.440\n And in a broken sort of state machine ask C.\n\n08:01.440 --> 08:02.920\n I didn't know how to program.\n\n08:02.920 --> 08:04.040\n Yeah.\n\n08:04.040 --> 08:06.480\n So how did you learn to program?\n\n08:07.400 --> 08:08.320\n What was your journey?\n\n08:08.320 --> 08:10.000\n Cause I mean, we'll talk about it.\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:12.640\n You've live streamed some of your programming.\n\n08:12.640 --> 08:14.360\n This chaotic, beautiful mess.\n\n08:14.360 --> 08:16.440\n How did you arrive at that?\n\n08:16.440 --> 08:18.600\n Years and years of practice.\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:22.720\n I interned at Google after the summer\n\n08:22.720 --> 08:24.760\n after the iPhone unlock.\n\n08:24.760 --> 08:27.960\n And I did a contract for them where I built hardware\n\n08:27.960 --> 08:30.640\n for Street View and I wrote a software library\n\n08:30.640 --> 08:31.760\n to interact with it.\n\n08:31.760 --> 08:34.360\n And it was terrible code.\n\n08:34.360 --> 08:36.440\n And for the first time I got feedback from people\n\n08:36.440 --> 08:40.600\n who I respected saying, no, like don't write code like this.\n\n08:42.120 --> 08:45.120\n Now, of course, just getting that feedback is not enough.\n\n08:45.120 --> 08:50.120\n The way that I really got good was I wanted to write\n\n08:51.080 --> 08:56.080\n this thing like that could emulate and then visualize\n\n08:56.480 --> 08:57.880\n like arm binaries.\n\n08:57.880 --> 08:59.480\n Cause I wanted to hack the iPhone better.\n\n08:59.480 --> 09:01.120\n And I didn't like that I couldn't like see\n\n09:01.120 --> 09:03.720\n what the, I couldn't single step through the processor\n\n09:03.720 --> 09:05.120\n because I had no debugger on there,\n\n09:05.120 --> 09:06.560\n especially for the low level things like the boot rum\n\n09:06.560 --> 09:07.480\n and the bootloader.\n\n09:07.480 --> 09:09.400\n So I tried to build this tool to do it.\n\n09:10.880 --> 09:13.400\n And I built the tool once and it was terrible.\n\n09:13.400 --> 09:15.080\n I built the tool a second time, it was terrible.\n\n09:15.080 --> 09:16.320\n I built the tool a third time.\n\n09:16.320 --> 09:18.600\n This was by the time I was at Facebook, it was kind of okay.\n\n09:18.600 --> 09:20.520\n And then I built the tool a fourth time\n\n09:20.520 --> 09:22.520\n when I was a Google intern again in 2014.\n\n09:22.520 --> 09:24.320\n And that was the first time I was like,\n\n09:24.320 --> 09:25.840\n this is finally usable.\n\n09:25.840 --> 09:27.080\n How do you pronounce this Kira?\n\n09:27.080 --> 09:28.360\n Kira, yeah.\n\n09:28.360 --> 09:31.800\n So it's essentially the most efficient way\n\n09:31.800 --> 09:35.680\n to visualize the change of state of the computer\n\n09:35.680 --> 09:37.160\n as the program is running.\n\n09:37.160 --> 09:38.840\n That's what you mean by debugger.\n\n09:38.840 --> 09:41.720\n Yeah, it's a timeless debugger.\n\n09:41.720 --> 09:45.040\n So you can rewind just as easily as going forward.\n\n09:45.040 --> 09:46.200\n Think about if you're using GDB,\n\n09:46.200 --> 09:47.840\n you have to put a watch on a variable.\n\n09:47.840 --> 09:49.640\n If you wanna see if that variable changes.\n\n09:49.640 --> 09:51.480\n In Kira, you can just click on that variable\n\n09:51.480 --> 09:53.840\n and then it shows every single time\n\n09:53.840 --> 09:56.480\n when that variable was changed or accessed.\n\n09:56.480 --> 09:59.760\n Think about it like Git for your computers, the run log.\n\n09:59.760 --> 10:04.760\n So there's like a deep log of the state of the computer\n\n10:05.600 --> 10:07.800\n as the program runs and you can rewind.\n\n10:07.800 --> 10:11.440\n Why isn't that, maybe it is, maybe you can educate me.\n\n10:11.440 --> 10:14.600\n Why isn't that kind of debugging used more often?\n\n10:14.600 --> 10:16.280\n Cause the tooling's bad.\n\n10:16.280 --> 10:17.120\n Well, two things.\n\n10:17.120 --> 10:19.320\n One, if you're trying to debug Chrome,\n\n10:19.320 --> 10:22.840\n Chrome is a 200 megabyte binary\n\n10:22.840 --> 10:25.400\n that runs slowly on desktops.\n\n10:25.400 --> 10:27.640\n So that's gonna be really hard to use for that.\n\n10:27.640 --> 10:30.080\n But it's really good to use for like CTFs\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:33.120\n and for boot roms and for small parts of code.\n\n10:33.120 --> 10:36.280\n So it's hard if you're trying to debug like massive systems.\n\n10:36.280 --> 10:38.120\n What's a CTF and what's a boot rom?\n\n10:38.120 --> 10:40.400\n A boot rom is the first code that executes\n\n10:40.400 --> 10:42.160\n the minute you give power to your iPhone.\n\n10:42.160 --> 10:43.440\n Okay.\n\n10:43.440 --> 10:45.520\n And CTF where these competitions\n\n10:45.520 --> 10:46.880\n that I played capture the flag.\n\n10:46.880 --> 10:48.480\n Capture the flag, I was gonna ask you about that.\n\n10:48.480 --> 10:49.840\n What are those, look at,\n\n10:49.840 --> 10:51.320\n I watched a couple of videos on YouTube,\n\n10:51.320 --> 10:52.840\n those look fascinating.\n\n10:52.840 --> 10:54.760\n What have you learned about maybe\n\n10:54.760 --> 10:56.680\n at the high level of vulnerability of systems\n\n10:56.680 --> 10:57.880\n from these competitions?\n\n11:00.760 --> 11:04.160\n I feel like in the heyday of CTFs,\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:08.080\n you had all of the best security people in the world\n\n11:08.080 --> 11:10.640\n challenging each other and coming up\n\n11:10.640 --> 11:13.600\n with new toy exploitable things over here.\n\n11:13.600 --> 11:15.320\n And then everybody, okay, who can break it?\n\n11:15.320 --> 11:17.080\n And when you break it, you get like,\n\n11:17.080 --> 11:19.280\n there's like a file on the server called flag.\n\n11:19.280 --> 11:20.920\n And then there's a program running,\n\n11:20.920 --> 11:22.600\n listening on a socket that's vulnerable.\n\n11:22.600 --> 11:24.920\n So you write an exploit, you get a shell,\n\n11:24.920 --> 11:27.080\n and then you cat flag, and then you type the flag\n\n11:27.080 --> 11:29.440\n into like a web based scoreboard and you get points.\n\n11:29.440 --> 11:31.520\n So the goal is essentially,\n\n11:31.520 --> 11:32.920\n to find an exploit in the system\n\n11:32.920 --> 11:35.200\n that allows you to run shell,\n\n11:35.200 --> 11:37.960\n to run arbitrary code on that system.\n\n11:37.960 --> 11:40.120\n That's one of the categories.\n\n11:40.120 --> 11:41.880\n That's like the pwnable category.\n\n11:43.480 --> 11:44.320\n Pwnable?\n\n11:44.320 --> 11:45.160\n Yeah, pwnable.\n\n11:45.160 --> 11:47.520\n It's like, you know, you pwn the program.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:48.920\n It's a program that's, yeah.\n\n11:48.920 --> 11:53.920\n Yeah, you know, first of all, I apologize.\n\n11:54.160 --> 11:56.240\n I'm gonna say it's because I'm Russian,\n\n11:56.240 --> 11:59.080\n but maybe you can help educate me.\n\n12:00.080 --> 12:02.760\n Some video game like misspelled own way back in the day.\n\n12:02.760 --> 12:06.280\n Yeah, and it's just, I wonder if there's a definition.\n\n12:06.280 --> 12:08.240\n I'll have to go to Urban Dictionary for it.\n\n12:08.240 --> 12:09.720\n It'll be interesting to see what it says.\n\n12:09.720 --> 12:12.720\n Okay, so what was the heyday of CTF, by the way?\n\n12:12.720 --> 12:15.440\n But was it, what decade are we talking about?\n\n12:15.440 --> 12:18.360\n I think like, I mean, maybe unbiased\n\n12:18.360 --> 12:21.040\n because it's the era that I played,\n\n12:21.040 --> 12:25.720\n but like 2011 to 2015,\n\n12:27.120 --> 12:30.240\n because the modern CTF scene\n\n12:30.240 --> 12:32.560\n is similar to the modern competitive programming scene.\n\n12:32.560 --> 12:34.200\n You have people who like do drills.\n\n12:34.200 --> 12:35.800\n You have people who practice.\n\n12:35.800 --> 12:36.920\n And then once you've done that,\n\n12:36.920 --> 12:39.960\n you've turned it less into a game of generic computer skill\n\n12:39.960 --> 12:41.680\n and more into a game of, okay,\n\n12:41.680 --> 12:44.560\n you drill on these five categories.\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:48.880\n And then before that, it wasn't,\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:51.480\n it didn't have like as much attention as it had.\n\n12:52.760 --> 12:53.600\n I don't know, they were like,\n\n12:53.600 --> 12:56.040\n I won $30,000 once in Korea for one of these competitions.\n\n12:56.040 --> 12:56.880\n Holy crap.\n\n12:56.880 --> 12:57.880\n Yeah, they were, they were, that was.\n\n12:57.880 --> 12:59.480\n So that means, I mean, money is money,\n\n12:59.480 --> 13:02.240\n but that means there was probably good people there.\n\n13:02.240 --> 13:03.520\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:06.720\n Are the challenges human constructed\n\n13:06.720 --> 13:10.720\n or are they grounded in some real flaws and real systems?\n\n13:10.720 --> 13:13.000\n Usually they're human constructed,\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:15.720\n but they're usually inspired by real flaws.\n\n13:15.720 --> 13:17.240\n What kind of systems are imagined\n\n13:17.240 --> 13:19.040\n is really focused on mobile.\n\n13:19.040 --> 13:20.880\n Like what has vulnerabilities these days?\n\n13:20.880 --> 13:25.080\n Is it primarily mobile systems like Android?\n\n13:25.080 --> 13:26.480\n Oh, everything does.\n\n13:26.480 --> 13:28.040\n Still. Yeah, of course.\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:29.320\n The price has kind of gone up\n\n13:29.320 --> 13:31.200\n because less and less people can find them.\n\n13:31.200 --> 13:32.760\n And what's happened in security\n\n13:32.760 --> 13:34.480\n is now if you want to like jailbreak an iPhone,\n\n13:34.480 --> 13:36.840\n you don't need one exploit anymore, you need nine.\n\n13:37.880 --> 13:39.600\n Nine chained together, what would it mean?\n\n13:39.600 --> 13:40.560\n Yeah, wow.\n\n13:40.560 --> 13:42.680\n Okay, so it's really,\n\n13:42.680 --> 13:46.120\n what's the benefit speaking higher level\n\n13:46.120 --> 13:48.160\n philosophically about hacking?\n\n13:48.160 --> 13:50.320\n I mean, it sounds from everything I've seen about you,\n\n13:50.320 --> 13:51.840\n you just love the challenge\n\n13:51.840 --> 13:54.960\n and you don't want to do anything.\n\n13:54.960 --> 13:58.040\n You don't want to bring that exploit out into the world\n\n13:58.040 --> 14:01.600\n and do any actual, let it run wild.\n\n14:01.600 --> 14:02.680\n You just want to solve it\n\n14:02.680 --> 14:05.320\n and then you go on to the next thing.\n\n14:05.320 --> 14:08.360\n Oh yeah, I mean, doing criminal stuff's not really worth it.\n\n14:08.360 --> 14:10.440\n And I'll actually use the same argument\n\n14:10.440 --> 14:13.600\n for why I don't do defense for why I don't do crime.\n\n14:15.320 --> 14:16.720\n If you want to defend a system,\n\n14:16.720 --> 14:19.160\n say the system has 10 holes, right?\n\n14:19.160 --> 14:22.120\n If you find nine of those holes as a defender,\n\n14:22.120 --> 14:23.800\n you still lose because the attacker\n\n14:23.800 --> 14:25.400\n gets in through the last one.\n\n14:25.400 --> 14:26.240\n If you're an attacker,\n\n14:26.240 --> 14:28.600\n you only have to find one out of the 10.\n\n14:28.600 --> 14:30.680\n But if you're a criminal,\n\n14:30.680 --> 14:34.680\n if you log on with a VPN nine out of the 10 times,\n\n14:34.680 --> 14:37.640\n but one time you forget, you're done.\n\n14:37.640 --> 14:39.240\n Because you're caught, okay.\n\n14:39.240 --> 14:41.040\n Because you only have to mess up once\n\n14:41.040 --> 14:42.760\n to be caught as a criminal.\n\n14:42.760 --> 14:44.160\n That's why I'm not a criminal.\n\n14:45.800 --> 14:46.960\n But okay, let me,\n\n14:46.960 --> 14:49.400\n because I was having a discussion with somebody\n\n14:49.400 --> 14:52.640\n just at a high level about nuclear weapons actually,\n\n14:52.640 --> 14:56.120\n why we're having blown ourselves up yet.\n\n14:56.120 --> 14:59.680\n And my feeling is all the smart people in the world,\n\n14:59.680 --> 15:04.000\n if you look at the distribution of smart people,\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:06.600\n smart people are generally good.\n\n15:06.600 --> 15:07.920\n And then this other person I was talking to,\n\n15:07.920 --> 15:09.320\n Sean Carroll, the physicist,\n\n15:09.320 --> 15:11.280\n and he was saying, no, good and bad people\n\n15:11.280 --> 15:13.960\n are evenly distributed amongst everybody.\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:17.960\n My sense was good hackers are in general good people\n\n15:17.960 --> 15:20.280\n and they don't want to mess with the world.\n\n15:20.280 --> 15:21.640\n What's your sense?\n\n15:21.640 --> 15:24.560\n I'm not even sure about that.\n\n15:25.800 --> 15:26.640\n Like,\n\n15:28.880 --> 15:30.400\n I have a nice life.\n\n15:30.400 --> 15:32.000\n Crime wouldn't get me anything.\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:36.400\n But if you're good and you have these skills,\n\n15:36.400 --> 15:38.600\n you probably have a nice life too, right?\n\n15:38.600 --> 15:40.040\n Right, you can use it for other things.\n\n15:40.040 --> 15:41.000\n But is there an ethical,\n\n15:41.000 --> 15:44.080\n is there a little voice in your head that says,\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:48.920\n well, yeah, if you could hack something\n\n15:48.920 --> 15:50.600\n to where you could hurt people\n\n15:52.720 --> 15:54.840\n and you could earn a lot of money doing it though,\n\n15:54.840 --> 15:56.200\n not hurt physically perhaps,\n\n15:56.200 --> 15:58.880\n but disrupt their life in some kind of way,\n\n16:00.080 --> 16:02.200\n isn't there a little voice that says?\n\n16:03.240 --> 16:04.440\n Well, two things.\n\n16:04.440 --> 16:06.680\n One, I don't really care about money.\n\n16:06.680 --> 16:08.600\n So like the money wouldn't be an incentive.\n\n16:08.600 --> 16:10.560\n The thrill might be an incentive.\n\n16:10.560 --> 16:14.320\n But when I was 19, I read Crime and Punishment.\n\n16:14.320 --> 16:16.040\n And that was another great one\n\n16:16.040 --> 16:18.360\n that talked me out of ever really doing crime.\n\n16:19.320 --> 16:21.640\n Cause it's like, that's gonna be me.\n\n16:21.640 --> 16:25.000\n I'd get away with it, but it would just run through my head.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:26.400\n Even if I got away with it, you know?\n\n16:26.400 --> 16:27.560\n And then you do crime for long enough,\n\n16:27.560 --> 16:28.880\n you'll never get away with it.\n\n16:28.880 --> 16:29.720\n That's right.\n\n16:29.720 --> 16:32.600\n In the end, that's a good reason to be good.\n\n16:32.600 --> 16:33.440\n I wouldn't say I'm good.\n\n16:33.440 --> 16:34.840\n I would just say I'm not bad.\n\n16:34.840 --> 16:38.080\n You're a talented programmer and a hacker\n\n16:38.080 --> 16:40.920\n in a good positive sense of the word.\n\n16:40.920 --> 16:42.400\n You've played around,\n\n16:42.400 --> 16:44.720\n found vulnerabilities in various systems.\n\n16:44.720 --> 16:46.120\n What have you learned broadly\n\n16:46.120 --> 16:49.480\n about the design of systems and so on\n\n16:49.480 --> 16:51.520\n from that whole process?\n\n16:53.280 --> 16:58.280\n You learn to not take things\n\n16:59.280 --> 17:02.000\n for what people say they are,\n\n17:02.000 --> 17:05.280\n but you look at things for what they actually are.\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:07.880\n Yeah.\n\n17:07.880 --> 17:10.040\n I understand that's what you tell me it is,\n\n17:10.040 --> 17:11.440\n but what does it do?\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:12.920\n Right.\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:14.560\n And you have nice visualization tools\n\n17:14.560 --> 17:16.680\n to really know what it's really doing.\n\n17:16.680 --> 17:17.760\n Oh, I wish.\n\n17:17.760 --> 17:20.040\n I'm a better programmer now than I was in 2014.\n\n17:20.040 --> 17:21.840\n I said, Kira, that was the first tool\n\n17:21.840 --> 17:23.400\n that I wrote that was usable.\n\n17:23.400 --> 17:25.320\n I wouldn't say the code was great.\n\n17:25.320 --> 17:27.160\n I still wouldn't say my code is great.\n\n17:28.800 --> 17:31.480\n So how was your evolution as a programmer except practice?\n\n17:31.480 --> 17:33.840\n So you started with C.\n\n17:33.840 --> 17:35.520\n At which point did you pick up Python?\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:37.040\n Because you're pretty big in Python now.\n\n17:37.040 --> 17:39.920\n Now, yeah, in college.\n\n17:39.920 --> 17:42.480\n I went to Carnegie Mellon when I was 22.\n\n17:42.480 --> 17:43.320\n I went back.\n\n17:43.320 --> 17:44.160\n I'm like, all right,\n\n17:44.160 --> 17:46.600\n I'm gonna take all your hardest CS courses.\n\n17:46.600 --> 17:47.600\n We'll see how I do, right?\n\n17:47.600 --> 17:48.520\n Like, did I miss anything\n\n17:48.520 --> 17:51.480\n by not having a real undergraduate education?\n\n17:51.480 --> 17:54.200\n Took operating systems, compilers, AI,\n\n17:54.200 --> 17:56.840\n and they're like a freshman wheat or math course.\n\n17:58.560 --> 18:00.480\n And...\n\n18:00.480 --> 18:02.120\n Operating systems, some of those classes\n\n18:02.120 --> 18:04.160\n you mentioned are pretty tough, actually.\n\n18:04.160 --> 18:05.560\n They're great.\n\n18:05.560 --> 18:08.600\n At least the 2012, circa 2012,\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:12.200\n operating systems and compilers were two of the,\n\n18:12.200 --> 18:14.360\n they were the best classes I've ever taken in my life.\n\n18:14.360 --> 18:15.560\n Because you write an operating system\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:16.800\n and you write a compiler.\n\n18:18.040 --> 18:19.720\n I wrote my operating system in C\n\n18:19.720 --> 18:21.320\n and I wrote my compiler in Haskell,\n\n18:21.320 --> 18:26.320\n but somehow I picked up Python that semester as well.\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:28.040\n I started using it for the CTFs, actually.\n\n18:28.040 --> 18:30.280\n That's when I really started to get into CTFs\n\n18:30.280 --> 18:33.320\n and CTFs, you're all, it's a race against the clock.\n\n18:33.320 --> 18:35.080\n So I can't write things in C.\n\n18:35.080 --> 18:36.200\n Oh, there's a clock component.\n\n18:36.200 --> 18:38.000\n So you really want to use the programming languages\n\n18:38.000 --> 18:38.920\n so you can be fastest.\n\n18:38.920 --> 18:41.400\n 48 hours, pwn as many of these challenges as you can.\n\n18:41.400 --> 18:42.240\n Pwn.\n\n18:42.240 --> 18:43.920\n Yeah, you got like a hundred points of challenge.\n\n18:43.920 --> 18:45.360\n Whatever team gets the most.\n\n18:46.280 --> 18:50.200\n You were both at Facebook and Google for a brief stint.\n\n18:50.200 --> 18:51.040\n Yeah.\n\n18:51.040 --> 18:54.880\n With Project Zero actually at Google for five months\n\n18:54.880 --> 18:56.920\n where you developed Kira.\n\n18:56.920 --> 18:59.840\n What was Project Zero about in general?\n\n18:59.840 --> 19:03.960\n What, I'm just curious about the security efforts\n\n19:03.960 --> 19:05.160\n in these companies.\n\n19:05.160 --> 19:08.760\n Well, Project Zero started the same time I went there.\n\n19:08.760 --> 19:10.040\n What years are there?\n\n19:11.080 --> 19:12.320\n 2015.\n\n19:12.320 --> 19:13.160\n 2015.\n\n19:13.160 --> 19:15.040\n So that was right at the beginning of Project Zero.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:16.200\n It's small.\n\n19:16.200 --> 19:18.840\n It's Google's offensive security team.\n\n19:21.840 --> 19:25.640\n I'll try to give the best public facing explanation\n\n19:25.640 --> 19:26.480\n that I can.\n\n19:26.480 --> 19:31.480\n So the idea is basically these vulnerabilities\n\n19:31.760 --> 19:33.200\n exist in the world.\n\n19:33.200 --> 19:35.200\n Nation states have them.\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:37.440\n Some high powered bad actors have them.\n\n19:39.800 --> 19:44.160\n Sometime people will find these vulnerabilities\n\n19:44.160 --> 19:47.800\n and submit them in bug bounties to the companies.\n\n19:47.800 --> 19:49.480\n But a lot of the companies don't really care.\n\n19:49.480 --> 19:51.160\n They don't even fix the bug.\n\n19:51.160 --> 19:53.840\n It doesn't hurt for there to be a vulnerability.\n\n19:53.840 --> 19:55.920\n So Project Zero is like, we're going to do it different.\n\n19:55.920 --> 19:57.880\n We're going to announce a vulnerability\n\n19:57.880 --> 19:59.680\n and we're going to give them 90 days to fix it.\n\n19:59.680 --> 20:00.840\n And then whether they fix it or not,\n\n20:00.840 --> 20:03.240\n we're going to drop the zero day.\n\n20:03.240 --> 20:04.120\n Oh, wow.\n\n20:04.120 --> 20:04.960\n We're going to drop the weapon.\n\n20:04.960 --> 20:05.920\n That's so cool.\n\n20:05.920 --> 20:07.520\n That is so cool.\n\n20:07.520 --> 20:09.240\n I love the deadlines.\n\n20:09.240 --> 20:10.080\n Oh, that's so cool.\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:10.920\n Give them real deadlines.\n\n20:10.920 --> 20:12.360\n Yeah.\n\n20:12.360 --> 20:15.800\n And I think it's done a lot for moving the industry forward.\n\n20:15.800 --> 20:18.920\n I watched your coding sessions on the streamed online.\n\n20:20.360 --> 20:22.720\n You code things up, the basic projects,\n\n20:22.720 --> 20:24.000\n usually from scratch.\n\n20:24.000 --> 20:28.200\n I would say sort of as a programmer myself,\n\n20:28.200 --> 20:30.360\n just watching you that you type really fast\n\n20:30.360 --> 20:34.520\n and your brain works in both brilliant and chaotic ways.\n\n20:34.520 --> 20:35.800\n I don't know if that's always true,\n\n20:35.800 --> 20:37.600\n but certainly for the live streams.\n\n20:37.600 --> 20:40.360\n So it's interesting to me because I'm more,\n\n20:40.360 --> 20:43.520\n I'm much slower and systematic and careful.\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:44.920\n And you just move, I mean,\n\n20:44.920 --> 20:46.960\n probably in order of magnitude faster.\n\n20:48.040 --> 20:51.080\n So I'm curious, is there a method to your madness?\n\n20:51.080 --> 20:53.040\n Is it just who you are?\n\n20:53.040 --> 20:54.720\n There's pros and cons.\n\n20:54.720 --> 20:58.080\n There's pros and cons to my programming style.\n\n20:58.080 --> 20:59.440\n And I'm aware of them.\n\n20:59.440 --> 21:03.560\n Like if you ask me to like get something up\n\n21:03.560 --> 21:05.400\n and working quickly with like an API\n\n21:05.400 --> 21:06.760\n that's kind of undocumented,\n\n21:06.760 --> 21:08.160\n I will do this super fast\n\n21:08.160 --> 21:10.200\n because I will throw things at it until it works.\n\n21:10.200 --> 21:14.720\n If you ask me to take a vector and rotate it 90 degrees\n\n21:14.720 --> 21:17.400\n and then flip it over the XY plane,\n\n21:19.320 --> 21:22.320\n I'll spam program for two hours and won't get it.\n\n21:22.320 --> 21:23.920\n Oh, because it's something that you could do\n\n21:23.920 --> 21:26.280\n with a sheet of paper, think through design,\n\n21:26.280 --> 21:30.440\n and then just, do you really just throw stuff at the wall\n\n21:30.440 --> 21:34.640\n and you get so good at it that it usually works?\n\n21:34.640 --> 21:36.960\n I should become better at the other kind as well.\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:39.440\n Sometimes I'll do things methodically.\n\n21:39.440 --> 21:41.160\n It's nowhere near as entertaining on the Twitch streams.\n\n21:41.160 --> 21:43.520\n I do exaggerate it a bit on the Twitch streams as well.\n\n21:43.520 --> 21:44.680\n The Twitch streams, I mean,\n\n21:44.680 --> 21:45.840\n what do you want to see a game or you want to see\n\n21:45.840 --> 21:46.840\n actions per minute, right?\n\n21:46.840 --> 21:48.160\n I'll show you APM for programming too.\n\n21:48.160 --> 21:50.280\n Yeah, I recommend people go to it.\n\n21:50.280 --> 21:53.400\n I think I watched, I watched probably several hours\n\n21:53.400 --> 21:56.240\n of you, like I've actually left you programming\n\n21:56.240 --> 21:59.080\n in the background while I was programming\n\n21:59.080 --> 22:02.040\n because you made me, it was like watching\n\n22:02.040 --> 22:03.160\n a really good gamer.\n\n22:03.160 --> 22:06.280\n It's like energizes you because you're like moving so fast.\n\n22:06.280 --> 22:07.600\n It's so, it's awesome.\n\n22:07.600 --> 22:11.240\n It's inspiring and it made me jealous that like,\n\n22:12.320 --> 22:14.320\n because my own programming is inadequate\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:15.520\n in terms of speed.\n\n22:15.520 --> 22:17.000\n Oh, I was like.\n\n22:17.000 --> 22:20.520\n So I'm twice as frantic on the live streams\n\n22:20.520 --> 22:22.680\n as I am when I code without them.\n\n22:22.680 --> 22:23.760\n It's super entertaining.\n\n22:23.760 --> 22:26.440\n So I wasn't even paying attention to what you were coding,\n\n22:26.440 --> 22:27.280\n which is great.\n\n22:27.280 --> 22:30.840\n It's just watching you switch windows and Vim I guess\n\n22:30.840 --> 22:31.680\n is the most.\n\n22:31.680 --> 22:33.080\n Yeah, there's Vim on screen.\n\n22:33.080 --> 22:34.440\n I've developed the workload at Facebook\n\n22:34.440 --> 22:35.640\n and stuck with it.\n\n22:35.640 --> 22:37.360\n How do you learn new programming tools,\n\n22:37.360 --> 22:39.480\n ideas, techniques these days?\n\n22:39.480 --> 22:42.120\n What's your like a methodology for learning new things?\n\n22:42.120 --> 22:47.120\n So I wrote for comma, the distributed file systems\n\n22:48.800 --> 22:50.720\n out in the world are extremely complex.\n\n22:50.720 --> 22:55.280\n Like if you want to install something like like like Ceph,\n\n22:55.280 --> 22:58.760\n Ceph is I think the like open infrastructure\n\n22:58.760 --> 23:00.320\n distributed file system,\n\n23:00.320 --> 23:04.000\n or there's like newer ones like seaweed FS,\n\n23:04.000 --> 23:06.880\n but these are all like 10,000 plus line projects.\n\n23:06.880 --> 23:09.480\n I think some of them are even a hundred thousand line\n\n23:09.480 --> 23:11.120\n and just configuring them as a nightmare.\n\n23:11.120 --> 23:16.120\n So I wrote, I wrote one, it's 200 lines\n\n23:16.440 --> 23:18.880\n and it's, it uses like NGINX and volume servers\n\n23:18.880 --> 23:21.640\n and has this little master server that I wrote in Go.\n\n23:21.640 --> 23:24.200\n And the way I go, this,\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:27.240\n if I would say that I'm proud per line of any code I wrote,\n\n23:27.240 --> 23:29.160\n maybe there's some exploits that I think are beautiful.\n\n23:29.160 --> 23:31.320\n And then this, this is 200 lines.\n\n23:31.320 --> 23:33.720\n And just the way that I thought about it,\n\n23:33.720 --> 23:34.600\n I think was very good.\n\n23:34.600 --> 23:35.880\n And the reason it's very good is because\n\n23:35.880 --> 23:37.600\n that was the fourth version of it that I wrote.\n\n23:37.600 --> 23:39.320\n And I had three versions that I threw away.\n\n23:39.320 --> 23:40.960\n You mentioned, did you say Go?\n\n23:40.960 --> 23:41.800\n I wrote in Go, yeah.\n\n23:41.800 --> 23:42.640\n In Go.\n\n23:42.640 --> 23:43.840\n Is that a functional language?\n\n23:43.840 --> 23:45.240\n I forget what Go is.\n\n23:45.240 --> 23:47.120\n Go is Google's language.\n\n23:47.120 --> 23:48.200\n Right.\n\n23:48.200 --> 23:49.440\n It's not functional.\n\n23:49.440 --> 23:54.440\n It's some, it's like in a way it's C++, but easier.\n\n23:56.160 --> 23:58.160\n It's, it's strongly typed.\n\n23:58.160 --> 23:59.720\n It has a nice ecosystem around it.\n\n23:59.720 --> 24:02.680\n When I first looked at it, I was like, this is like Python,\n\n24:02.680 --> 24:04.560\n but it takes twice as long to do anything.\n\n24:04.560 --> 24:05.560\n Yeah.\n\n24:05.560 --> 24:09.560\n Now that I've, OpenPilot is migrating to C,\n\n24:09.560 --> 24:10.960\n but it still has large Python components.\n\n24:10.960 --> 24:12.720\n I now understand why Python doesn't work\n\n24:12.720 --> 24:15.800\n for large code bases and why you want something like Go.\n\n24:15.800 --> 24:16.640\n Interesting.\n\n24:16.640 --> 24:18.640\n So why, why doesn't Python work for,\n\n24:18.640 --> 24:21.680\n so even most, speaking for myself at least,\n\n24:21.680 --> 24:23.360\n like we do a lot of stuff,\n\n24:23.360 --> 24:26.480\n basically demo level work with autonomous vehicles\n\n24:26.480 --> 24:28.240\n and most of the work is Python.\n\n24:28.240 --> 24:29.200\n Yeah.\n\n24:29.200 --> 24:32.400\n Why doesn't Python work for large code bases?\n\n24:32.400 --> 24:37.400\n Because, well, lack of type checking is a big part.\n\n24:37.960 --> 24:39.360\n So errors creep in.\n\n24:39.360 --> 24:40.200\n Yeah.\n\n24:40.200 --> 24:41.920\n And like, you don't know,\n\n24:41.920 --> 24:45.320\n the compiler can tell you like nothing, right?\n\n24:45.320 --> 24:47.600\n So everything is either, you know,\n\n24:48.440 --> 24:49.880\n like, like syntax errors, fine.\n\n24:49.880 --> 24:51.800\n But if you misspell a variable in Python,\n\n24:51.800 --> 24:53.000\n the compiler won't catch that.\n\n24:53.000 --> 24:56.600\n There's like linters that can catch it some of the time.\n\n24:56.600 --> 24:57.560\n There's no types.\n\n24:57.560 --> 25:00.520\n This is really the biggest downside.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:02.640\n And then, well, Python's slow, but that's not related to it.\n\n25:02.640 --> 25:04.800\n Well, maybe it's kind of related to it, so it's lack of.\n\n25:04.800 --> 25:06.600\n So what's, what's in your toolbox these days?\n\n25:06.600 --> 25:07.440\n Is it Python?\n\n25:07.440 --> 25:08.280\n What else?\n\n25:08.280 --> 25:10.120\n I need to move to something else.\n\n25:10.120 --> 25:12.840\n My adventure into dependently typed languages,\n\n25:12.840 --> 25:14.200\n I love these languages.\n\n25:14.200 --> 25:17.480\n They just have like syntax from the 80s.\n\n25:18.480 --> 25:21.080\n What do you think about JavaScript?\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:23.960\n ES6, like the modern, or TypeScript?\n\n25:23.960 --> 25:26.080\n JavaScript is,\n\n25:26.080 --> 25:28.960\n the whole ecosystem is unbelievably confusing.\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:29.800\n Right.\n\n25:29.800 --> 25:32.800\n NPM updates a package from 0.2.2 to 0.2.5,\n\n25:32.800 --> 25:34.520\n and that breaks your Babel linter,\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:37.040\n which translates your ES5 into ES6,\n\n25:37.040 --> 25:39.920\n which doesn't run on, so.\n\n25:39.920 --> 25:42.440\n Why do I have to compile my JavaScript again, huh?\n\n25:42.440 --> 25:44.000\n It may be the future, though.\n\n25:44.000 --> 25:45.760\n You think about, I mean,\n\n25:45.760 --> 25:47.360\n I've embraced JavaScript recently,\n\n25:47.360 --> 25:52.280\n just because, just like I've continually embraced PHP,\n\n25:52.280 --> 25:54.840\n it seems that these worst possible languages\n\n25:54.840 --> 25:57.440\n live on for the longest, like cockroaches never die.\n\n25:57.440 --> 25:58.480\n Yeah.\n\n25:58.480 --> 26:00.720\n Well, it's in the browser, and it's fast.\n\n26:00.720 --> 26:01.680\n It's fast.\n\n26:01.680 --> 26:02.520\n Yeah.\n\n26:02.520 --> 26:04.880\n It's in the browser, and compute might stay,\n\n26:04.880 --> 26:06.440\n become, you know, the browser.\n\n26:06.440 --> 26:09.000\n It's unclear what the role of the browser is\n\n26:09.000 --> 26:12.320\n in terms of distributed computation in the future, so.\n\n26:13.600 --> 26:15.240\n JavaScript is definitely here to stay.\n\n26:15.240 --> 26:16.080\n Yeah.\n\n26:16.080 --> 26:18.160\n It's interesting if autonomous vehicles\n\n26:18.160 --> 26:19.480\n will run on JavaScript one day.\n\n26:19.480 --> 26:21.800\n I mean, you have to consider these possibilities.\n\n26:21.800 --> 26:24.280\n Well, all our debug tools are JavaScript.\n\n26:24.280 --> 26:26.040\n We actually just open sourced them.\n\n26:26.040 --> 26:27.400\n We have a tool, Explorer,\n\n26:27.400 --> 26:29.200\n which you can annotate your disengagements,\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:30.080\n and we have a tool, Cabana,\n\n26:30.080 --> 26:32.920\n which lets you analyze the can traffic from the car.\n\n26:32.920 --> 26:35.240\n So basically, anytime you're visualizing something\n\n26:35.240 --> 26:37.720\n about the log, you're using JavaScript.\n\n26:37.720 --> 26:41.280\n Well, the web is the best UI toolkit by far, so.\n\n26:41.280 --> 26:42.120\n And then, you know what?\n\n26:42.120 --> 26:42.960\n You're coding in JavaScript.\n\n26:42.960 --> 26:43.800\n We have a React guy.\n\n26:43.800 --> 26:44.640\n He's good.\n\n26:44.640 --> 26:46.080\n React, nice.\n\n26:46.080 --> 26:46.920\n Let's get into it.\n\n26:46.920 --> 26:48.800\n So let's talk autonomous vehicles.\n\n26:48.800 --> 26:49.640\n Yeah.\n\n26:49.640 --> 26:50.600\n You founded Comma AI.\n\n26:51.760 --> 26:54.920\n Let's, at a high level,\n\n26:54.920 --> 26:57.840\n how did you get into the world of vehicle automation?\n\n26:57.840 --> 26:59.880\n Can you also just, for people who don't know,\n\n26:59.880 --> 27:01.360\n tell the story of Comma AI?\n\n27:01.360 --> 27:02.880\n Sure.\n\n27:02.880 --> 27:06.080\n So I was working at this AI startup,\n\n27:06.080 --> 27:08.160\n and a friend approached me,\n\n27:08.160 --> 27:12.040\n and he's like, dude, I don't know where this is going,\n\n27:12.040 --> 27:15.160\n but the coolest applied AI problem today\n\n27:15.160 --> 27:16.480\n is self driving cars.\n\n27:16.480 --> 27:17.800\n I'm like, well, absolutely.\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:20.520\n You want to meet with Elon Musk,\n\n27:20.520 --> 27:24.560\n and he's looking for somebody to build a vision system\n\n27:24.560 --> 27:27.560\n for autopilot.\n\n27:27.560 --> 27:29.320\n This is when they were still on AP1.\n\n27:29.320 --> 27:30.840\n They were still using Mobileye.\n\n27:30.840 --> 27:33.680\n Elon, back then, was looking for a replacement,\n\n27:33.680 --> 27:36.160\n and he brought me in,\n\n27:36.160 --> 27:37.320\n and we talked about a contract\n\n27:37.320 --> 27:39.040\n where I would deliver something\n\n27:39.040 --> 27:41.360\n that meets Mobileye level performance.\n\n27:41.360 --> 27:43.920\n I would get paid $12 million if I could deliver it tomorrow,\n\n27:43.920 --> 27:45.280\n and I would lose $1 million\n\n27:45.280 --> 27:46.720\n for every month I didn't deliver.\n\n27:46.720 --> 27:47.720\n Yeah.\n\n27:47.720 --> 27:49.080\n So I was like, okay, this is a great deal.\n\n27:49.080 --> 27:50.880\n This is a super exciting challenge.\n\n27:52.360 --> 27:53.200\n You know what?\n\n27:53.200 --> 27:54.400\n Even if it takes me 10 months,\n\n27:54.400 --> 27:55.360\n I get $2 million.\n\n27:55.360 --> 27:56.200\n It's good.\n\n27:56.200 --> 27:57.120\n Maybe I can finish up in five.\n\n27:57.120 --> 27:58.120\n Maybe I don't finish it at all,\n\n27:58.120 --> 27:58.960\n and I get paid nothing,\n\n27:58.960 --> 28:00.840\n and I can still work for 12 months for free.\n\n28:00.840 --> 28:02.920\n So maybe just take a pause on that.\n\n28:02.920 --> 28:04.240\n I'm also curious about this\n\n28:04.240 --> 28:06.200\n because I've been working in robotics for a long time,\n\n28:06.200 --> 28:07.640\n and I'm curious to see a person like you\n\n28:07.640 --> 28:11.040\n just step in and sort of somewhat naive,\n\n28:11.040 --> 28:11.960\n but brilliant, right?\n\n28:11.960 --> 28:13.960\n So that's the best place to be\n\n28:13.960 --> 28:17.200\n because you basically full steam take on a problem.\n\n28:17.200 --> 28:19.680\n How confident, how, from that time,\n\n28:19.680 --> 28:21.280\n because you know a lot more now,\n\n28:21.280 --> 28:23.440\n at that time, how hard do you think it is\n\n28:23.440 --> 28:25.840\n to solve all of autonomous driving?\n\n28:25.840 --> 28:30.560\n I remember I suggested to Elon in the meeting\n\n28:30.560 --> 28:33.080\n putting a GPU behind each camera\n\n28:33.080 --> 28:35.120\n to keep the compute local.\n\n28:35.120 --> 28:38.000\n This is an incredibly stupid idea.\n\n28:38.000 --> 28:39.400\n I leave the meeting 10 minutes later,\n\n28:39.400 --> 28:41.520\n and I'm like, I could have spent a little bit of time\n\n28:41.520 --> 28:42.760\n thinking about this problem before I went in.\n\n28:42.760 --> 28:44.160\n Why is it a stupid idea?\n\n28:44.160 --> 28:46.240\n Oh, just send all your cameras to one big GPU.\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:48.200\n You're much better off doing that.\n\n28:48.200 --> 28:49.040\n Oh, sorry.\n\n28:49.040 --> 28:50.200\n You said behind every camera have a GPU.\n\n28:50.200 --> 28:51.360\n Every camera have a small GPU.\n\n28:51.360 --> 28:52.720\n I was like, oh, I'll put the first few layers\n\n28:52.720 --> 28:54.040\n of my comms there.\n\n28:54.040 --> 28:56.040\n Ugh, why'd I say that?\n\n28:56.040 --> 28:56.880\n That's possible.\n\n28:56.880 --> 28:58.960\n It's possible, but it's a bad idea.\n\n28:58.960 --> 29:00.440\n It's not obviously a bad idea.\n\n29:00.440 --> 29:01.280\n Pretty obviously bad,\n\n29:01.280 --> 29:02.920\n but whether it's actually a bad idea or not,\n\n29:02.920 --> 29:05.240\n I left that meeting with Elon, beating myself up.\n\n29:05.240 --> 29:07.000\n I'm like, why'd I say something stupid?\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.720\n Yeah, you haven't at least thought through\n\n29:10.720 --> 29:12.200\n every aspect of it, yeah.\n\n29:12.200 --> 29:13.360\n He's very sharp too.\n\n29:13.360 --> 29:15.760\n Usually in life, I get away with saying stupid things\n\n29:15.760 --> 29:16.920\n and then kind of course,\n\n29:16.920 --> 29:18.520\n oh, right away he called me out about it.\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:21.080\n And usually in life, I get away with saying stupid things\n\n29:21.080 --> 29:26.080\n and then a lot of times people don't even notice\n\n29:26.080 --> 29:28.200\n and I'll correct it and bring the conversation back.\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:31.840\n But with Elon, it was like, nope, okay, well.\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:33.520\n That's not at all why the contract fell through.\n\n29:33.520 --> 29:35.520\n I was much more prepared the second time I met him.\n\n29:35.520 --> 29:39.640\n Yeah, but in general, how hard did you think it is?\n\n29:39.640 --> 29:43.680\n Like 12 months is a tough timeline.\n\n29:43.680 --> 29:45.720\n Oh, I just thought I'd clone Mobileye IQ3.\n\n29:45.720 --> 29:47.560\n I didn't think I'd solve level five self driving\n\n29:47.560 --> 29:48.400\n or anything.\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:52.760\n So the goal there was to do lane keeping, good lane keeping.\n\n29:52.760 --> 29:55.480\n I saw, my friend showed me the outputs from a Mobileye\n\n29:55.480 --> 29:57.080\n and the outputs from a Mobileye was just basically\n\n29:57.080 --> 29:59.360\n two lanes at a position of a lead car.\n\n29:59.360 --> 30:02.160\n I'm like, I can gather a data set and train this net\n\n30:02.160 --> 30:04.760\n in weeks and I did.\n\n30:04.760 --> 30:07.520\n Well, first time I tried the implementation of Mobileye\n\n30:07.520 --> 30:10.360\n in a Tesla, I was really surprised how good it is.\n\n30:11.200 --> 30:12.240\n It's going incredibly good.\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:14.280\n Cause I thought it's just cause I've done a lot\n\n30:14.280 --> 30:17.960\n of computer vision, I thought it'd be a lot harder\n\n30:17.960 --> 30:20.000\n to create a system that that's stable.\n\n30:20.960 --> 30:24.200\n So I was personally surprised, you know,\n\n30:24.200 --> 30:25.040\n have to admit it.\n\n30:25.040 --> 30:27.800\n Cause I was kind of skeptical before trying it.\n\n30:27.800 --> 30:31.160\n Cause I thought it would go in and out a lot more.\n\n30:31.160 --> 30:34.960\n It would get disengaged a lot more and it's pretty robust.\n\n30:36.160 --> 30:41.160\n So what, how hard is the problem when you tackled it?\n\n30:42.080 --> 30:44.480\n So I think AP1 was great.\n\n30:44.480 --> 30:49.000\n Like Elon talked about disengagements on the 405 down in LA\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.000\n with like the lane marks are kind of faded\n\n30:51.000 --> 30:52.960\n and the Mobileye system would drop out.\n\n30:53.920 --> 30:57.760\n Like I had something up and working that I would say\n\n30:57.760 --> 31:01.400\n was like the same quality in three months.\n\n31:02.480 --> 31:04.720\n Same quality, but how do you know?\n\n31:04.720 --> 31:07.360\n You say stuff like that confidently, but you can't,\n\n31:07.360 --> 31:11.080\n and I love it, but the question is you can't,\n\n31:12.080 --> 31:14.400\n you're kind of going by feel cause you test it out.\n\n31:14.400 --> 31:15.440\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n31:15.440 --> 31:18.320\n Like I would take, I borrowed my friend's Tesla.\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:20.600\n I would take AP1 out for a drive\n\n31:20.600 --> 31:22.160\n and then I would take my system out for a drive.\n\n31:22.160 --> 31:24.280\n And it seems reasonably like the same.\n\n31:25.920 --> 31:30.320\n So the 405, how hard is it to create something\n\n31:30.320 --> 31:34.040\n that could actually be a product that's deployed?\n\n31:34.040 --> 31:37.120\n I mean, I've read an article where Elon,\n\n31:37.120 --> 31:40.640\n this respondent said something about you saying\n\n31:40.640 --> 31:45.640\n that to build autopilot is more complicated\n\n31:46.920 --> 31:51.720\n than a single George Hodge level job.\n\n31:51.720 --> 31:55.360\n How hard is that job to create something\n\n31:55.360 --> 31:57.280\n that would work across globally?\n\n31:58.800 --> 32:00.480\n Why don't think globally is the challenge?\n\n32:00.480 --> 32:02.080\n But Elon followed that up by saying\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:04.760\n it's gonna take two years in a company of 10 people.\n\n32:04.760 --> 32:07.760\n And here I am four years later with a company of 12 people.\n\n32:07.760 --> 32:09.800\n And I think we still have another two to go.\n\n32:09.800 --> 32:11.160\n Two years, so yeah.\n\n32:11.160 --> 32:15.840\n So what do you think about how Tesla is progressing\n\n32:15.840 --> 32:19.080\n with autopilot of V2, V3?\n\n32:19.080 --> 32:23.000\n I think we've kept pace with them pretty well.\n\n32:23.960 --> 32:26.720\n I think navigate and autopilot is terrible.\n\n32:26.720 --> 32:31.000\n We had some demo features internally of the same stuff\n\n32:31.000 --> 32:32.080\n and we would test it.\n\n32:32.080 --> 32:33.320\n And I'm like, I'm not shipping this\n\n32:33.320 --> 32:35.160\n even as like open source software to people.\n\n32:35.160 --> 32:37.280\n Why do you think it's terrible?\n\n32:37.280 --> 32:39.480\n Consumer Reports does a great job of describing it.\n\n32:39.480 --> 32:41.160\n Like when it makes a lane change,\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:43.520\n it does it worse than a human.\n\n32:43.520 --> 32:46.880\n You shouldn't ship things like autopilot, open pilot.\n\n32:46.880 --> 32:49.680\n They lane keep better than a human.\n\n32:49.680 --> 32:53.360\n If you turn it on for a stretch of a highway,\n\n32:53.360 --> 32:56.600\n like an hour long, it's never gonna touch a lane line.\n\n32:56.600 --> 32:58.960\n Human will touch probably a lane line twice.\n\n32:58.960 --> 33:00.000\n You just inspired me.\n\n33:00.000 --> 33:02.120\n I don't know if you're grounded in data on that.\n\n33:02.120 --> 33:03.200\n I read your paper.\n\n33:03.200 --> 33:05.320\n Okay, but that's interesting.\n\n33:05.320 --> 33:10.320\n I wonder actually how often we touch lane lines\n\n33:10.560 --> 33:11.960\n in general, like a little bit,\n\n33:11.960 --> 33:13.440\n because it is.\n\n33:13.440 --> 33:14.920\n I could answer that question pretty easily\n\n33:14.920 --> 33:15.760\n with the common data set.\n\n33:15.760 --> 33:16.960\n Yeah, I'm curious.\n\n33:16.960 --> 33:17.800\n I've never answered it.\n\n33:17.800 --> 33:18.640\n I don't know.\n\n33:18.640 --> 33:19.960\n I just, two is like my personal.\n\n33:19.960 --> 33:21.720\n It feels right.\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:22.560\n That's interesting.\n\n33:22.560 --> 33:23.800\n Because every time you touch a lane,\n\n33:23.800 --> 33:26.720\n that's a source of a little bit of stress\n\n33:26.720 --> 33:29.280\n and kind of lane keeping is removing that stress.\n\n33:29.280 --> 33:32.320\n That's ultimately the biggest value add honestly\n\n33:32.320 --> 33:35.520\n is just removing the stress of having to stay in lane.\n\n33:35.520 --> 33:39.000\n And I think honestly, I don't think people fully realize,\n\n33:39.000 --> 33:41.920\n first of all, that that's a big value add,\n\n33:41.920 --> 33:44.960\n but also that that's all it is.\n\n33:44.960 --> 33:48.560\n And that not only, I find it a huge value add.\n\n33:48.560 --> 33:50.400\n I drove down when we moved to San Diego,\n\n33:50.400 --> 33:53.320\n I drove down in a enterprise rental car and I missed it.\n\n33:53.320 --> 33:55.440\n So I missed having the system so much.\n\n33:55.440 --> 34:00.280\n It's so much more tiring to drive without it.\n\n34:00.280 --> 34:02.920\n It is that lane centering.\n\n34:02.920 --> 34:04.800\n That's the key feature.\n\n34:04.800 --> 34:05.640\n Yeah.\n\n34:06.560 --> 34:08.920\n And in a way, it's the only feature\n\n34:08.920 --> 34:11.000\n that actually adds value to people's lives\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:12.160\n in autonomous vehicles today.\n\n34:12.160 --> 34:13.800\n Waymo does not add value to people's lives.\n\n34:13.800 --> 34:15.840\n It's a more expensive, slower Uber.\n\n34:15.840 --> 34:18.600\n Maybe someday it'll be this big cliff where it adds value,\n\n34:18.600 --> 34:19.440\n but I don't usually believe it.\n\n34:19.440 --> 34:20.280\n It is fascinating.\n\n34:20.280 --> 34:22.520\n I haven't talked to, this is good.\n\n34:22.520 --> 34:25.760\n Cause I haven't, I have intuitively,\n\n34:25.760 --> 34:28.240\n but I think we're making it explicit now.\n\n34:28.240 --> 34:33.240\n I actually believe that really good lane keeping\n\n34:35.440 --> 34:37.200\n is a reason to buy a car.\n\n34:37.200 --> 34:39.680\n Will be a reason to buy a car and it's a huge value add.\n\n34:39.680 --> 34:41.720\n I've never, until we just started talking about it,\n\n34:41.720 --> 34:43.840\n I haven't really quite realized it.\n\n34:43.840 --> 34:48.840\n That I've felt with Elon's chase of level four\n\n34:49.400 --> 34:52.320\n is not the correct chase.\n\n34:52.320 --> 34:55.920\n It was on, cause you should just say Tesla has the best\n\n34:55.920 --> 34:58.280\n as if from a Tesla perspective, say,\n\n34:58.280 --> 35:00.560\n Tesla has the best lane keeping.\n\n35:00.560 --> 35:04.120\n Comma AI should say, Comma AI is the best lane keeping.\n\n35:04.120 --> 35:05.560\n And that is it.\n\n35:05.560 --> 35:06.400\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n35:06.400 --> 35:07.960\n So do you think?\n\n35:07.960 --> 35:09.880\n You have to do the longitudinal as well.\n\n35:09.880 --> 35:10.880\n You can't just lane keep.\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:12.880\n You have to do ACC,\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:15.760\n but ACC is much more forgiving than lane keep,\n\n35:15.760 --> 35:17.360\n especially on the highway.\n\n35:17.360 --> 35:21.920\n By the way, are you Comma AI's camera only, correct?\n\n35:21.920 --> 35:23.680\n No, we use the radar.\n\n35:23.680 --> 35:25.440\n From the car, you're able to get the, okay.\n\n35:25.440 --> 35:26.960\n Hmm?\n\n35:26.960 --> 35:28.800\n We can do a camera only now.\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:29.640\n It's gotten to the point,\n\n35:29.640 --> 35:33.440\n but we leave the radar there as like a, it's fusion now.\n\n35:33.440 --> 35:36.520\n Okay, so let's maybe talk through some of the system specs\n\n35:36.520 --> 35:37.920\n on the hardware.\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:42.880\n What's the hardware side of what you're providing?\n\n35:42.880 --> 35:44.720\n What's the capabilities on the software side\n\n35:44.720 --> 35:46.800\n with OpenPilot and so on?\n\n35:46.800 --> 35:51.800\n So OpenPilot, as the box that we sell, that it runs on,\n\n35:52.200 --> 35:54.440\n it's a phone in a plastic case.\n\n35:54.440 --> 35:55.280\n It's nothing special.\n\n35:55.280 --> 35:56.680\n We sell it without the software.\n\n35:56.680 --> 35:59.360\n So you buy the phone, it's just easy.\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:02.160\n It'll be easy set up, but it's sold with no software.\n\n36:03.960 --> 36:07.040\n OpenPilot right now is about to be 0.6.\n\n36:07.040 --> 36:08.280\n When it gets to 1.0,\n\n36:08.280 --> 36:10.120\n I think we'll be ready for a consumer product.\n\n36:10.120 --> 36:11.600\n We're not gonna add any new features.\n\n36:11.600 --> 36:14.120\n We're just gonna make the lane keeping really, really good.\n\n36:14.120 --> 36:15.560\n Okay, I got it.\n\n36:15.560 --> 36:16.560\n So what do we have right now?\n\n36:16.560 --> 36:18.600\n It's a Snapdragon 820.\n\n36:20.000 --> 36:24.080\n It's a Sony IMX 298 forward facing camera.\n\n36:24.080 --> 36:26.040\n Driver monitoring camera,\n\n36:26.040 --> 36:27.960\n it's just a selfie camera on the phone.\n\n36:27.960 --> 36:31.640\n And a CAN transceiver,\n\n36:31.640 --> 36:33.840\n maybe there's a little thing called PANDAS.\n\n36:33.840 --> 36:36.560\n And they talk over USB to the phone\n\n36:36.560 --> 36:37.720\n and then they have three CAN buses\n\n36:37.720 --> 36:39.000\n that they talk to the car.\n\n36:39.960 --> 36:42.280\n One of those CAN buses is the radar CAN bus.\n\n36:42.280 --> 36:44.320\n One of them is the main car CAN bus\n\n36:44.320 --> 36:46.240\n and the other one is the proxy camera CAN bus.\n\n36:46.240 --> 36:48.400\n We leave the existing camera in place\n\n36:48.400 --> 36:50.720\n so we don't turn AEB off.\n\n36:50.720 --> 36:52.320\n Right now, we still turn AEB off\n\n36:52.320 --> 36:53.600\n if you're using our longitudinal,\n\n36:53.600 --> 36:55.600\n but we're gonna fix that before 1.0.\n\n36:55.600 --> 36:56.440\n Got it.\n\n36:56.440 --> 36:57.280\n Wow, that's cool.\n\n36:57.280 --> 36:59.040\n And it's CAN both ways.\n\n36:59.040 --> 37:03.320\n So how are you able to control vehicles?\n\n37:03.320 --> 37:05.440\n So we proxy,\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:06.760\n the vehicles that we work with\n\n37:06.760 --> 37:10.160\n already have a lane keeping assist system.\n\n37:10.160 --> 37:13.800\n So lane keeping assist can mean a huge variety of things.\n\n37:13.800 --> 37:17.800\n It can mean it will apply a small torque to the wheel\n\n37:17.800 --> 37:21.160\n after you've already crossed a lane line by a foot,\n\n37:21.160 --> 37:23.920\n which is the system in the older Toyotas\n\n37:23.920 --> 37:26.520\n versus like, I think Tesla still calls it\n\n37:26.520 --> 37:27.560\n lane keeping assist,\n\n37:27.560 --> 37:28.840\n where it'll keep you perfectly\n\n37:28.840 --> 37:31.060\n in the center of the lane on the highway.\n\n37:32.320 --> 37:35.080\n You can control, like with the joystick, the car.\n\n37:35.080 --> 37:37.920\n So these cars already have the capability of drive by wire.\n\n37:37.920 --> 37:42.920\n So is it trivial to convert a car that it operates with?\n\n37:45.400 --> 37:47.560\n OpenPILOT is able to control the steering?\n\n37:48.480 --> 37:49.720\n Oh, a new car or a car that we,\n\n37:49.720 --> 37:52.800\n so we have support now for 45 different makes of cars.\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:54.880\n What are the cars in general?\n\n37:54.880 --> 37:56.360\n Mostly Hondas and Toyotas.\n\n37:56.360 --> 38:00.620\n We support almost every Honda and Toyota made this year.\n\n38:01.680 --> 38:04.480\n And then a bunch of GMs, a bunch of Subarus,\n\n38:04.480 --> 38:05.320\n a bunch of Chevys.\n\n38:05.320 --> 38:06.160\n It doesn't have to be like a Prius,\n\n38:06.160 --> 38:07.320\n it could be a Corolla as well.\n\n38:07.320 --> 38:10.760\n Oh, the 2020 Corolla is the best car with OpenPILOT.\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:11.720\n It just came out.\n\n38:11.720 --> 38:14.160\n The actuator has less lag than the older Corolla.\n\n38:15.800 --> 38:18.240\n I think I started watching a video with your,\n\n38:18.240 --> 38:21.400\n I mean, the way you make videos is awesome.\n\n38:21.400 --> 38:24.220\n You're just literally at the dealership streaming.\n\n38:24.220 --> 38:26.060\n Yeah, I had my friend on the phone,\n\n38:26.060 --> 38:27.520\n I'm like, bro, you wanna stream for an hour?\n\n38:27.520 --> 38:31.100\n Yeah, and basically, like if stuff goes a little wrong,\n\n38:31.100 --> 38:33.120\n you're just like, you just go with it.\n\n38:33.120 --> 38:33.940\n Yeah, I love it.\n\n38:33.940 --> 38:34.780\n Well, it's real.\n\n38:34.780 --> 38:35.600\n Yeah, it's real.\n\n38:35.600 --> 38:39.760\n That's so beautiful and it's so in contrast\n\n38:39.760 --> 38:42.960\n to the way other companies\n\n38:42.960 --> 38:44.680\n would put together a video like that.\n\n38:44.680 --> 38:46.080\n Kind of why I like to do it like that.\n\n38:46.080 --> 38:46.920\n Good.\n\n38:46.920 --> 38:49.840\n I mean, if you become super rich one day and successful,\n\n38:49.840 --> 38:50.800\n I hope you keep it that way\n\n38:50.800 --> 38:53.200\n because I think that's actually what people love,\n\n38:53.200 --> 38:54.760\n that kind of genuine.\n\n38:54.760 --> 38:56.520\n Oh, it's all that has value to me.\n\n38:56.520 --> 38:59.920\n Money has no, if I sell out to like make money,\n\n38:59.920 --> 39:01.320\n I sold out, it doesn't matter.\n\n39:01.320 --> 39:02.160\n What do I get?\n\n39:02.160 --> 39:03.000\n Yacht?\n\n39:03.000 --> 39:04.560\n I don't want a yacht.\n\n39:04.560 --> 39:09.240\n And I think Tesla's actually has a small inkling\n\n39:09.240 --> 39:11.320\n of that as well with Autonomy Day.\n\n39:11.320 --> 39:14.080\n They did reveal more than, I mean, of course,\n\n39:14.080 --> 39:15.760\n there's marketing communications, you could tell,\n\n39:15.760 --> 39:17.720\n but it's more than most companies would reveal,\n\n39:17.720 --> 39:21.440\n which is, I hope they go towards that direction more,\n\n39:21.440 --> 39:23.080\n other companies, GM, Ford.\n\n39:23.080 --> 39:25.440\n Oh, Tesla's gonna win level five.\n\n39:25.440 --> 39:26.600\n They really are.\n\n39:26.600 --> 39:27.840\n So let's talk about it.\n\n39:27.840 --> 39:32.280\n You think, you're focused on level two currently?\n\n39:32.280 --> 39:33.120\n Currently.\n\n39:33.120 --> 39:36.200\n We're gonna be one to two years behind Tesla\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:37.200\n getting to level five.\n\n39:37.200 --> 39:38.560\n Okay.\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:39.400\n We're Android, right?\n\n39:39.400 --> 39:40.220\n We're Android.\n\n39:40.220 --> 39:41.060\n You're Android.\n\n39:41.060 --> 39:42.280\n I'm just saying, once Tesla gets it,\n\n39:42.280 --> 39:43.800\n we're one to two years behind.\n\n39:43.800 --> 39:45.640\n I'm not making any timeline on when Tesla's\n\n39:45.640 --> 39:46.480\n gonna get it. That's right.\n\n39:46.480 --> 39:47.300\n You did, that was brilliant.\n\n39:47.300 --> 39:48.400\n I'm sorry, Tesla investors,\n\n39:48.400 --> 39:49.880\n if you think you're gonna have an autonomous\n\n39:49.880 --> 39:52.460\n Robo Taxi fleet by the end of the year.\n\n39:52.460 --> 39:53.300\n Yeah, so that's.\n\n39:53.300 --> 39:54.960\n I'll bet against that.\n\n39:54.960 --> 39:57.740\n So what do you think about this?\n\n39:57.740 --> 39:59.840\n The most level four companies\n\n40:02.000 --> 40:07.000\n are kind of just doing their usual safety driver,\n\n40:07.280 --> 40:08.800\n doing full autonomy kind of testing.\n\n40:08.800 --> 40:12.000\n And then Tesla does basically trying to go\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:15.600\n from lane keeping to full autonomy.\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:16.840\n What do you think about that approach?\n\n40:16.840 --> 40:18.400\n How successful would it be?\n\n40:18.400 --> 40:20.720\n It's a ton better approach.\n\n40:20.720 --> 40:23.980\n Because Tesla is gathering data on a scale\n\n40:23.980 --> 40:25.240\n that none of them are.\n\n40:25.240 --> 40:29.560\n They're putting real users behind the wheel of the cars.\n\n40:29.560 --> 40:32.260\n It's, I think, the only strategy that works.\n\n40:33.120 --> 40:34.480\n The incremental.\n\n40:34.480 --> 40:36.980\n Well, so there's a few components to Tesla approach\n\n40:36.980 --> 40:38.920\n that's more than just the incrementalists.\n\n40:38.920 --> 40:41.440\n What you spoke with is the ones, the software,\n\n40:41.440 --> 40:43.760\n so over the air software updates.\n\n40:43.760 --> 40:44.840\n Necessity.\n\n40:44.840 --> 40:46.480\n I mean Waymo crews have those too.\n\n40:46.480 --> 40:47.660\n Those aren't.\n\n40:47.660 --> 40:48.500\n But.\n\n40:48.500 --> 40:49.880\n Those differentiate from the automakers.\n\n40:49.880 --> 40:52.040\n Right, no lane keeping systems have,\n\n40:52.040 --> 40:54.840\n no cars with lane keeping system have that except Tesla.\n\n40:54.840 --> 40:55.800\n Yeah.\n\n40:55.800 --> 40:59.840\n And the other one is the data, the other direction,\n\n40:59.840 --> 41:01.920\n which is the ability to query the data.\n\n41:01.920 --> 41:03.560\n I don't think they're actually collecting\n\n41:03.560 --> 41:04.580\n as much data as people think,\n\n41:04.580 --> 41:08.180\n but the ability to turn on collection and turn it off.\n\n41:09.520 --> 41:12.120\n So I'm both in the robotics world\n\n41:12.120 --> 41:15.080\n and the psychology human factors world.\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:18.540\n Many people believe that level two autonomy is problematic\n\n41:18.540 --> 41:20.120\n because of the human factor.\n\n41:20.120 --> 41:23.380\n Like the more the task is automated,\n\n41:23.380 --> 41:26.080\n the more there's a vigilance decrement.\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:27.240\n You start to fall asleep.\n\n41:27.240 --> 41:28.600\n You start to become complacent,\n\n41:28.600 --> 41:30.560\n start texting more and so on.\n\n41:30.560 --> 41:32.320\n Do you worry about that?\n\n41:32.320 --> 41:35.080\n Cause if we're talking about transition from lane keeping\n\n41:35.080 --> 41:39.880\n to full autonomy, if you're spending 80% of the time,\n\n41:39.880 --> 41:42.840\n not supervising the machine,\n\n41:42.840 --> 41:45.480\n do you worry about what that means\n\n41:45.480 --> 41:47.140\n to the safety of the drivers?\n\n41:47.140 --> 41:49.640\n One, we don't consider open pilot to be 1.0\n\n41:49.640 --> 41:52.360\n until we have 100% driver monitoring.\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:55.040\n You can cheat right now, our driver monitoring system.\n\n41:55.040 --> 41:56.080\n There's a few ways to cheat it.\n\n41:56.080 --> 41:57.280\n They're pretty obvious.\n\n41:58.200 --> 41:59.720\n We're working on making that better.\n\n41:59.720 --> 42:02.560\n Before we ship a consumer product that can drive cars,\n\n42:02.560 --> 42:04.240\n I want to make sure that I have driver monitoring\n\n42:04.240 --> 42:05.480\n that you can't cheat.\n\n42:05.480 --> 42:07.840\n What's like a successful driver monitoring system look like?\n\n42:07.840 --> 42:11.720\n Is it all about just keeping your eyes on the road?\n\n42:11.720 --> 42:12.760\n Well, a few things.\n\n42:12.760 --> 42:16.640\n So that's what we went with at first for driver monitoring.\n\n42:16.640 --> 42:18.040\n I'm checking, I'm actually looking at\n\n42:18.040 --> 42:19.040\n where your head is looking.\n\n42:19.040 --> 42:20.440\n The camera's not that high resolution.\n\n42:20.440 --> 42:21.880\n Eyes are a little bit hard to get.\n\n42:21.880 --> 42:22.920\n Well, head is this big.\n\n42:22.920 --> 42:23.760\n I mean, that's.\n\n42:23.760 --> 42:24.680\n Head is good.\n\n42:24.680 --> 42:28.740\n And actually a lot of it, just psychology wise,\n\n42:28.740 --> 42:30.760\n to have that monitor constantly there,\n\n42:30.760 --> 42:33.480\n it reminds you that you have to be paying attention.\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:35.120\n But we want to go further.\n\n42:35.120 --> 42:36.400\n We just hired someone full time\n\n42:36.400 --> 42:37.960\n to come on to do the driver monitoring.\n\n42:37.960 --> 42:40.400\n I want to detect phone in frame\n\n42:40.400 --> 42:42.600\n and I want to make sure you're not sleeping.\n\n42:42.600 --> 42:44.880\n How much does the camera see of the body?\n\n42:44.880 --> 42:47.480\n This one, not enough.\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:48.440\n Not enough.\n\n42:48.440 --> 42:50.760\n The next one, everything.\n\n42:50.760 --> 42:51.600\n Well, it's interesting, Fisheye,\n\n42:51.600 --> 42:55.240\n because we're doing just data collection, not real time.\n\n42:55.240 --> 42:57.600\n But Fisheye is a beautiful,\n\n42:57.600 --> 42:59.080\n being able to capture the body.\n\n42:59.080 --> 43:03.280\n And the smartphone is really like the biggest problem.\n\n43:03.280 --> 43:04.120\n I'll show you.\n\n43:04.120 --> 43:06.360\n I can show you one of the pictures from our new system.\n\n43:06.360 --> 43:09.680\n Awesome, so you're basically saying\n\n43:09.680 --> 43:13.120\n the driver monitoring will be the answer to that.\n\n43:13.120 --> 43:14.320\n I think the other point\n\n43:14.320 --> 43:16.960\n that you raised in your paper is good as well.\n\n43:16.960 --> 43:20.480\n You're not asking a human to supervise a machine\n\n43:20.480 --> 43:21.680\n without giving them the,\n\n43:21.680 --> 43:23.220\n they can take over at any time.\n\n43:23.220 --> 43:24.060\n Right.\n\n43:24.060 --> 43:25.800\n Our safety model, you can take over.\n\n43:25.800 --> 43:27.880\n We disengage on both the gas or the brake.\n\n43:27.880 --> 43:28.900\n We don't disengage on steering.\n\n43:28.900 --> 43:30.020\n I don't feel you have to.\n\n43:30.020 --> 43:31.760\n But we disengage on gas or brake.\n\n43:31.760 --> 43:34.320\n So it's very easy for you to take over\n\n43:34.320 --> 43:36.440\n and it's very easy for you to reengage.\n\n43:36.440 --> 43:39.380\n That switching should be super cheap.\n\n43:39.380 --> 43:40.240\n The cars that require,\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:42.440\n even autopilot requires a double press.\n\n43:42.440 --> 43:44.400\n That's almost, I see, I don't like that.\n\n43:44.400 --> 43:48.080\n And then the cancel, to cancel in autopilot,\n\n43:48.080 --> 43:49.040\n you either have to press cancel,\n\n43:49.040 --> 43:51.040\n which no one knows what that is, so they press the brake.\n\n43:51.040 --> 43:52.120\n But a lot of times you don't actually want\n\n43:52.120 --> 43:53.380\n to press the brake.\n\n43:53.380 --> 43:54.560\n You want to press the gas.\n\n43:54.560 --> 43:55.920\n So you should cancel on gas.\n\n43:55.920 --> 43:57.960\n Or wiggle the steering wheel, which is bad as well.\n\n43:57.960 --> 43:58.920\n Wow, that's brilliant.\n\n43:58.920 --> 44:01.440\n I haven't heard anyone articulate that point.\n\n44:01.440 --> 44:03.480\n Oh, this is all I think about.\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:05.880\n It's the, because I think,\n\n44:06.960 --> 44:09.800\n I think actually Tesla has done a better job\n\n44:09.800 --> 44:12.920\n than most automakers at making that frictionless.\n\n44:12.920 --> 44:15.520\n But you just described that it could be even better.\n\n44:16.600 --> 44:21.160\n I love Super Cruise as an experience once it's engaged.\n\n44:21.160 --> 44:22.040\n I don't know if you've used it,\n\n44:22.040 --> 44:24.040\n but getting the thing to try to engage.\n\n44:25.040 --> 44:27.520\n Yeah, I've used the, I've driven Super Cruise a lot.\n\n44:27.520 --> 44:29.440\n So what's your thoughts on the Super Cruise system?\n\n44:29.440 --> 44:32.680\n You disengage Super Cruise and it falls back to ACC.\n\n44:32.680 --> 44:34.640\n So my car's like still accelerating.\n\n44:34.640 --> 44:36.280\n It feels weird.\n\n44:36.280 --> 44:39.040\n Otherwise, when you actually have Super Cruise engaged\n\n44:39.040 --> 44:41.200\n on the highway, it is phenomenal.\n\n44:41.200 --> 44:42.320\n We bought that Cadillac.\n\n44:42.320 --> 44:43.320\n We just sold it.\n\n44:43.320 --> 44:45.620\n But we bought it just to like experience this.\n\n44:45.620 --> 44:47.320\n And I wanted everyone in the office to be like,\n\n44:47.320 --> 44:49.400\n this is what we're striving to build.\n\n44:49.400 --> 44:51.540\n GM pioneering with the driver monitoring.\n\n44:52.800 --> 44:55.000\n You like their driver monitoring system?\n\n44:55.000 --> 44:56.400\n It has some bugs.\n\n44:56.400 --> 45:00.280\n If there's a sun shining back here, it'll be blind to you.\n\n45:00.280 --> 45:01.100\n Right.\n\n45:01.960 --> 45:03.340\n But overall, mostly, yeah.\n\n45:03.340 --> 45:05.920\n That's so cool that you know all this stuff.\n\n45:05.920 --> 45:08.460\n I don't often talk to people that,\n\n45:08.460 --> 45:10.980\n because it's such a rare car, unfortunately, currently.\n\n45:10.980 --> 45:12.700\n We bought one explicitly for this.\n\n45:12.700 --> 45:15.020\n We lost like 25K in the deprecation,\n\n45:15.020 --> 45:16.700\n but I feel it's worth it.\n\n45:16.700 --> 45:21.260\n I was very pleasantly surprised that GM system\n\n45:21.260 --> 45:26.260\n was so innovative and really wasn't advertised much,\n\n45:26.320 --> 45:27.460\n wasn't talked about much.\n\n45:27.460 --> 45:28.460\n Yeah.\n\n45:28.460 --> 45:30.420\n And I was nervous that it would die,\n\n45:30.420 --> 45:31.860\n that it would disappear.\n\n45:31.860 --> 45:33.500\n Well, they put it on the wrong car.\n\n45:33.500 --> 45:34.580\n They should have put it on the Bolt\n\n45:34.580 --> 45:36.620\n and not some weird Cadillac that nobody bought.\n\n45:36.620 --> 45:38.420\n I think that's gonna be into,\n\n45:38.420 --> 45:40.020\n they're saying at least it's gonna be\n\n45:40.020 --> 45:41.820\n into their entire fleet.\n\n45:41.820 --> 45:43.820\n So what do you think about,\n\n45:43.820 --> 45:45.940\n as long as we're on the driver monitoring,\n\n45:45.940 --> 45:49.280\n what do you think about Elon Musk's claim\n\n45:49.280 --> 45:51.940\n that driver monitoring is not needed?\n\n45:51.940 --> 45:53.700\n Normally, I love his claims.\n\n45:53.700 --> 45:55.560\n That one is stupid.\n\n45:55.560 --> 45:56.580\n That one is stupid.\n\n45:56.580 --> 46:00.320\n And, you know, he's not gonna have his level five fleet\n\n46:00.320 --> 46:01.340\n by the end of the year.\n\n46:01.340 --> 46:04.900\n Hopefully he's like, okay, I was wrong.\n\n46:04.900 --> 46:06.260\n I'm gonna add driver monitoring.\n\n46:06.260 --> 46:08.260\n Because when these systems get to the point\n\n46:08.260 --> 46:10.340\n that they're only messing up once every thousand miles,\n\n46:10.340 --> 46:12.260\n you absolutely need driver monitoring.\n\n46:14.060 --> 46:15.900\n So let me play, cause I agree with you,\n\n46:15.900 --> 46:17.340\n but let me play devil's advocate.\n\n46:17.340 --> 46:22.340\n One possibility is that without driver monitoring,\n\n46:22.340 --> 46:26.420\n people are able to monitor, self regulate,\n\n46:26.420 --> 46:28.260\n monitor themselves.\n\n46:28.260 --> 46:30.500\n You know, that, so your idea is.\n\n46:30.500 --> 46:32.860\n You've seen all the people sleeping in Teslas?\n\n46:33.860 --> 46:37.340\n Yeah, well, I'm a little skeptical\n\n46:37.340 --> 46:38.860\n of all the people sleeping in Teslas\n\n46:38.860 --> 46:43.860\n because I've stopped paying attention to that kind of stuff\n\n46:44.260 --> 46:45.660\n because I want to see real data.\n\n46:45.660 --> 46:47.180\n It's too much glorified.\n\n46:47.180 --> 46:48.660\n It doesn't feel scientific to me.\n\n46:48.660 --> 46:52.500\n So I want to know how many people are really sleeping\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:54.620\n in Teslas versus sleeping.\n\n46:54.620 --> 46:58.060\n I was driving here sleep deprived in a car\n\n46:58.060 --> 46:59.420\n with no automation.\n\n46:59.420 --> 47:00.980\n I was falling asleep.\n\n47:00.980 --> 47:02.060\n I agree that it's hypey.\n\n47:02.060 --> 47:04.780\n It's just like, you know what?\n\n47:04.780 --> 47:06.020\n If you want to put driver monitoring,\n\n47:06.020 --> 47:08.420\n I rented a, my last autopilot experience\n\n47:08.420 --> 47:12.140\n was I rented a model three in March and drove it around.\n\n47:12.140 --> 47:13.500\n The wheel thing is annoying.\n\n47:13.500 --> 47:15.340\n And the reason the wheel thing is annoying,\n\n47:15.340 --> 47:16.700\n we use the wheel thing as well,\n\n47:16.700 --> 47:18.620\n but we don't disengage on wheel.\n\n47:18.620 --> 47:21.620\n For Tesla, you have to touch the wheel just enough\n\n47:21.620 --> 47:25.260\n to trigger the torque sensor, to tell it that you're there,\n\n47:25.260 --> 47:27.420\n but not enough as to disengage it,\n\n47:28.340 --> 47:30.380\n which don't use it for two things.\n\n47:30.380 --> 47:31.300\n Don't disengage on wheel.\n\n47:31.300 --> 47:32.340\n You don't have to.\n\n47:32.340 --> 47:35.300\n That whole experience, wow, beautifully put.\n\n47:35.300 --> 47:36.300\n All of those elements,\n\n47:36.300 --> 47:38.180\n even if you don't have driver monitoring,\n\n47:38.180 --> 47:41.060\n that whole experience needs to be better.\n\n47:41.060 --> 47:43.700\n Driver monitoring, I think would make,\n\n47:43.700 --> 47:46.140\n I mean, I think Super Cruise is a better experience\n\n47:46.140 --> 47:48.340\n once it's engaged over autopilot.\n\n47:48.340 --> 47:50.900\n I think Super Cruise is a transition\n\n47:50.900 --> 47:53.900\n to engagement and disengagement are significantly worse.\n\n47:53.900 --> 47:54.900\n Yeah.\n\n47:54.900 --> 47:56.340\n Well, there's a tricky thing,\n\n47:56.340 --> 47:58.780\n because if I were to criticize Super Cruise is,\n\n47:59.660 --> 48:00.740\n it's a little too crude.\n\n48:00.740 --> 48:03.580\n And I think like six seconds or something,\n\n48:03.580 --> 48:05.980\n if you look off road, it'll start warning you.\n\n48:05.980 --> 48:09.020\n It's some ridiculously long period of time.\n\n48:09.020 --> 48:11.340\n And just the way,\n\n48:12.740 --> 48:15.740\n I think it's basically, it's a binary.\n\n48:15.740 --> 48:17.180\n It should be adaptive.\n\n48:17.180 --> 48:19.820\n Yeah, it needs to learn more about you.\n\n48:19.820 --> 48:22.980\n It needs to communicate what it sees about you more.\n\n48:24.380 --> 48:27.100\n Tesla shows what it sees about the external world.\n\n48:27.100 --> 48:29.060\n It would be nice if Super Cruise would tell us\n\n48:29.060 --> 48:30.780\n what it sees about the internal world.\n\n48:30.780 --> 48:31.900\n It's even worse than that.\n\n48:31.900 --> 48:33.260\n You press the button to engage\n\n48:33.260 --> 48:35.380\n and it just says Super Cruise unavailable.\n\n48:35.380 --> 48:36.220\n Yeah. Why?\n\n48:36.220 --> 48:37.740\n Why?\n\n48:37.740 --> 48:41.420\n Yeah, that transparency is good.\n\n48:41.420 --> 48:45.300\n We've renamed the driver monitoring packet to driver state.\n\n48:45.300 --> 48:46.140\n Driver state.\n\n48:46.140 --> 48:48.220\n We have car state packet, which has the state of the car.\n\n48:48.220 --> 48:49.380\n And you have driver state packet,\n\n48:49.380 --> 48:50.940\n which has the state of the driver.\n\n48:50.940 --> 48:52.060\n So what is the...\n\n48:52.060 --> 48:53.980\n Estimate their BAC.\n\n48:53.980 --> 48:54.820\n What's BAC?\n\n48:54.820 --> 48:55.860\n Blood alcohol content.\n\n48:57.260 --> 48:59.100\n You think that's possible with computer vision?\n\n48:59.100 --> 48:59.940\n Absolutely.\n\n49:03.300 --> 49:04.420\n To me, it's an open question.\n\n49:04.420 --> 49:06.580\n I haven't looked into it too much.\n\n49:06.580 --> 49:08.380\n Actually, I quite seriously looked at the literature.\n\n49:08.380 --> 49:10.780\n It's not obvious to me that from the eyes and so on,\n\n49:10.780 --> 49:11.620\n you can tell.\n\n49:11.620 --> 49:13.140\n You might need stuff from the car as well.\n\n49:13.140 --> 49:13.980\n Yeah.\n\n49:13.980 --> 49:15.700\n You might need how they're controlling the car, right?\n\n49:15.700 --> 49:17.340\n And that's fundamentally at the end of the day,\n\n49:17.340 --> 49:18.620\n what you care about.\n\n49:18.620 --> 49:21.620\n But I think, especially when people are really drunk,\n\n49:21.620 --> 49:23.620\n they're not controlling the car nearly as smoothly\n\n49:23.620 --> 49:25.460\n as they would look at them walking, right?\n\n49:25.460 --> 49:27.220\n The car is like an extension of the body.\n\n49:27.220 --> 49:29.380\n So I think you could totally detect.\n\n49:29.380 --> 49:31.340\n And if you could fix people who are drunk, distracted,\n\n49:31.340 --> 49:32.820\n asleep, if you fix those three.\n\n49:32.820 --> 49:35.460\n Yeah, that's huge.\n\n49:35.460 --> 49:38.220\n So what are the current limitations of open pilot?\n\n49:38.220 --> 49:41.700\n What are the main problems that still need to be solved?\n\n49:41.700 --> 49:45.420\n We're hopefully fixing a few of them in 06.\n\n49:45.420 --> 49:49.460\n We're not as good as autopilot at stop cars.\n\n49:49.460 --> 49:55.180\n So if you're coming up to a red light at 55,\n\n49:55.180 --> 49:57.060\n so it's the radar stopped car problem, which\n\n49:57.060 --> 49:59.180\n is responsible for two autopilot accidents,\n\n49:59.180 --> 50:03.580\n it's hard to differentiate a stopped car from a signpost.\n\n50:03.580 --> 50:05.300\n Yeah, a static object.\n\n50:05.300 --> 50:06.300\n So you have to fuse.\n\n50:06.300 --> 50:07.500\n You have to do this visually.\n\n50:07.500 --> 50:09.580\n There's no way from the radar data to tell the difference.\n\n50:09.580 --> 50:11.540\n Maybe you can make a map, but I don't really\n\n50:11.540 --> 50:13.820\n believe in mapping at all anymore.\n\n50:13.820 --> 50:16.020\n Wait, wait, wait, what, you don't believe in mapping?\n\n50:16.020 --> 50:16.660\n No.\n\n50:16.660 --> 50:20.660\n So you basically, the open pilot solution\n\n50:20.660 --> 50:22.660\n is saying react to the environment as you see it,\n\n50:22.660 --> 50:24.460\n just like human beings do.\n\n50:24.460 --> 50:25.820\n And then eventually, when you want\n\n50:25.820 --> 50:28.380\n to do navigate on open pilot, I'll\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:29.940\n train the net to look at ways.\n\n50:29.940 --> 50:31.460\n I'll run ways in the background, I'll\n\n50:31.460 --> 50:32.300\n train a confident way.\n\n50:32.300 --> 50:34.540\n Are you using GPS at all?\n\n50:34.540 --> 50:35.940\n We use it to ground truth.\n\n50:35.940 --> 50:38.340\n We use it to very carefully ground truth the paths.\n\n50:38.340 --> 50:40.980\n We have a stack which can recover relative to 10\n\n50:40.980 --> 50:42.940\n centimeters over one minute.\n\n50:42.940 --> 50:45.020\n And then we use that to ground truth exactly where\n\n50:45.020 --> 50:47.420\n the car went in that local part of the environment,\n\n50:47.420 --> 50:48.700\n but it's all local.\n\n50:48.700 --> 50:50.780\n How are you testing in general, just for yourself,\n\n50:50.780 --> 50:53.220\n like experiments and stuff?\n\n50:53.220 --> 50:54.940\n Where are you located?\n\n50:54.940 --> 50:55.540\n San Diego.\n\n50:55.540 --> 50:56.140\n San Diego.\n\n50:56.140 --> 50:56.780\n Yeah.\n\n50:56.780 --> 50:58.660\n OK.\n\n50:58.660 --> 51:01.420\n So you basically drive around there, collect some data,\n\n51:01.420 --> 51:03.060\n and watch the performance?\n\n51:03.060 --> 51:04.300\n We have a simulator now.\n\n51:04.300 --> 51:06.420\n And we have, our simulator is really cool.\n\n51:06.420 --> 51:09.660\n Our simulator is not, it's not like a Unity based simulator.\n\n51:09.660 --> 51:12.820\n Our simulator lets us load in real state.\n\n51:12.820 --> 51:13.620\n What do you mean?\n\n51:13.620 --> 51:16.700\n We can load in a drive and simulate\n\n51:16.700 --> 51:20.260\n what the system would have done on the historical data.\n\n51:20.260 --> 51:22.460\n Ooh, nice.\n\n51:22.460 --> 51:23.460\n Interesting.\n\n51:23.460 --> 51:24.260\n So what, yeah.\n\n51:24.260 --> 51:26.060\n Right now we're only using it for testing,\n\n51:26.060 --> 51:29.140\n but as soon as we start using it for training, that's it.\n\n51:29.140 --> 51:30.780\n That's all that matters.\n\n51:30.780 --> 51:33.020\n What's your feeling about the real world versus simulation?\n\n51:33.020 --> 51:34.420\n Do you like simulation for training,\n\n51:34.420 --> 51:35.700\n if this moves to training?\n\n51:35.700 --> 51:40.020\n So we have to distinguish two types of simulators, right?\n\n51:40.020 --> 51:44.620\n There's a simulator that is completely fake.\n\n51:44.620 --> 51:47.740\n I could get my car to drive around in GTA.\n\n51:47.740 --> 51:51.780\n I feel that this kind of simulator is useless.\n\n51:51.780 --> 51:54.580\n You're never, there's so many.\n\n51:54.580 --> 51:56.940\n My analogy here is like, OK, fine.\n\n51:56.940 --> 51:59.860\n You're not solving the computer vision problem,\n\n51:59.860 --> 52:02.300\n but you're solving the computer graphics problem.\n\n52:02.300 --> 52:02.780\n Right.\n\n52:02.780 --> 52:05.300\n And you don't think you can get very far by creating\n\n52:05.300 --> 52:07.980\n ultra realistic graphics?\n\n52:07.980 --> 52:10.340\n No, because you can create ultra realistic graphics\n\n52:10.340 --> 52:13.140\n of the road, now create ultra realistic behavioral models\n\n52:13.140 --> 52:14.500\n of the other cars.\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:16.860\n Oh, well, I'll just use myself driving.\n\n52:16.860 --> 52:18.180\n No, you won't.\n\n52:18.180 --> 52:22.180\n You need actual human behavior, because that's\n\n52:22.180 --> 52:23.860\n what you're trying to learn.\n\n52:23.860 --> 52:25.820\n Driving does not have a spec.\n\n52:25.820 --> 52:29.860\n The definition of driving is what humans do when they drive.\n\n52:29.860 --> 52:32.700\n Whatever Waymo does, I don't think it's driving.\n\n52:32.700 --> 52:33.220\n Right.\n\n52:33.220 --> 52:36.380\n Well, I think actually Waymo and others,\n\n52:36.380 --> 52:38.980\n if there's any use for reinforcement learning,\n\n52:38.980 --> 52:40.340\n I've seen it used quite well.\n\n52:40.340 --> 52:42.020\n I study pedestrians a lot, too, is\n\n52:42.020 --> 52:45.500\n try to train models from real data of how pedestrians move,\n\n52:45.500 --> 52:47.540\n and try to use reinforcement learning models to make\n\n52:47.540 --> 52:49.980\n pedestrians move in human like ways.\n\n52:49.980 --> 52:53.500\n By that point, you've already gone so many layers,\n\n52:53.500 --> 52:55.660\n you detected a pedestrian?\n\n52:55.660 --> 53:00.180\n Did you hand code the feature vector of their state?\n\n53:00.180 --> 53:02.860\n Did you guys learn anything from computer vision\n\n53:02.860 --> 53:04.580\n before deep learning?\n\n53:04.580 --> 53:07.140\n Well, OK, I feel like this is.\n\n53:07.140 --> 53:10.820\n So perception to you is the sticking point.\n\n53:10.820 --> 53:13.780\n I mean, what's the hardest part of the stack here?\n\n53:13.780 --> 53:20.500\n There is no human understandable feature vector separating\n\n53:20.500 --> 53:23.060\n perception and planning.\n\n53:23.060 --> 53:25.100\n That's the best way I can put that.\n\n53:25.100 --> 53:26.780\n There is no, so it's all together,\n\n53:26.780 --> 53:29.540\n and it's a joint problem.\n\n53:29.540 --> 53:31.460\n So you can take localization.\n\n53:31.460 --> 53:33.260\n Localization and planning, there is\n\n53:33.260 --> 53:35.300\n a human understandable feature vector between these two\n\n53:35.300 --> 53:35.980\n things.\n\n53:35.980 --> 53:38.540\n I mean, OK, so I have like three degrees position,\n\n53:38.540 --> 53:40.540\n three degrees orientation, and those derivatives,\n\n53:40.540 --> 53:41.980\n maybe those second derivatives.\n\n53:41.980 --> 53:43.140\n That's human understandable.\n\n53:43.140 --> 53:45.460\n That's physical.\n\n53:45.460 --> 53:50.780\n Between perception and planning, so like Waymo\n\n53:50.780 --> 53:53.620\n has a perception stack and then a planner.\n\n53:53.620 --> 53:55.580\n And one of the things Waymo does right\n\n53:55.580 --> 54:00.020\n is they have a simulator that can separate those two.\n\n54:00.020 --> 54:02.900\n They can like replay their perception data\n\n54:02.900 --> 54:04.380\n and test their system, which is what\n\n54:04.380 --> 54:05.380\n I'm talking about about like the two\n\n54:05.380 --> 54:06.500\n different kinds of simulators.\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:08.220\n There's the kind that can work on real data,\n\n54:08.220 --> 54:10.860\n and there's the kind that can't work on real data.\n\n54:10.860 --> 54:14.900\n Now, the problem is that I don't think you can hand code\n\n54:14.900 --> 54:16.140\n a feature vector, right?\n\n54:16.140 --> 54:17.740\n Like you have some list of like, oh, here's\n\n54:17.740 --> 54:19.100\n my list of cars in the scenes.\n\n54:19.100 --> 54:21.220\n Here's my list of pedestrians in the scene.\n\n54:21.220 --> 54:23.180\n This isn't what humans are doing.\n\n54:23.180 --> 54:24.860\n What are humans doing?\n\n54:24.860 --> 54:27.180\n Global.\n\n54:27.180 --> 54:31.860\n And you're saying that's too difficult to hand engineer.\n\n54:31.860 --> 54:35.020\n I'm saying that there is no state vector given a perfect.\n\n54:35.020 --> 54:37.300\n I could give you the best team of engineers in the world\n\n54:37.300 --> 54:39.060\n to build a perception system and the best team\n\n54:39.060 --> 54:40.580\n to build a planner.\n\n54:40.580 --> 54:42.660\n All you have to do is define the state vector\n\n54:42.660 --> 54:43.860\n that separates those two.\n\n54:43.860 --> 54:48.580\n I'm missing the state vector that separates those two.\n\n54:48.580 --> 54:49.300\n What do you mean?\n\n54:49.300 --> 54:53.860\n So what is the output of your perception system?\n\n54:53.860 --> 55:00.500\n Output of the perception system, it's, OK, well,\n\n55:00.500 --> 55:01.620\n there's several ways to do it.\n\n55:01.620 --> 55:03.780\n One is the SLAM components localization.\n\n55:03.780 --> 55:05.780\n The other is drivable area, drivable space.\n\n55:05.780 --> 55:06.580\n Drivable space, yeah.\n\n55:06.580 --> 55:10.860\n And then there's the different objects in the scene.\n\n55:10.860 --> 55:15.340\n And different objects in the scene over time,\n\n55:15.340 --> 55:17.660\n maybe, to give you input to then try\n\n55:17.660 --> 55:21.500\n to start modeling the trajectories of those objects.\n\n55:21.500 --> 55:22.140\n Sure.\n\n55:22.140 --> 55:22.740\n That's it.\n\n55:22.740 --> 55:24.060\n I can give you a concrete example\n\n55:24.060 --> 55:25.060\n of something you missed.\n\n55:25.060 --> 55:25.780\n What's that?\n\n55:25.780 --> 55:28.580\n So say there's a bush in the scene.\n\n55:28.580 --> 55:30.860\n Humans understand that when they see this bush\n\n55:30.860 --> 55:34.580\n that there may or may not be a car behind that bush.\n\n55:34.580 --> 55:37.180\n Drivable area and a list of objects does not include that.\n\n55:37.180 --> 55:40.820\n Humans are doing this constantly at the simplest intersections.\n\n55:40.820 --> 55:44.900\n So now you have to talk about occluded area.\n\n55:44.900 --> 55:47.740\n But even that, what do you mean by occluded?\n\n55:47.740 --> 55:49.500\n OK, so I can't see it.\n\n55:49.500 --> 55:51.740\n Well, if it's the other side of a house, I don't care.\n\n55:51.740 --> 55:53.100\n What's the likelihood that there's\n\n55:53.100 --> 55:55.180\n a car in that occluded area?\n\n55:55.180 --> 55:57.940\n And if you say, OK, we'll add that,\n\n55:57.940 --> 56:01.620\n I can come up with 10 more examples that you can't add.\n\n56:01.620 --> 56:03.860\n Certainly, occluded area would be something\n\n56:03.860 --> 56:05.860\n that Simulator would have because it's\n\n56:05.860 --> 56:11.180\n simulating the entire occlusion is part of it.\n\n56:11.180 --> 56:12.580\n Occlusion is part of a vision stack.\n\n56:12.580 --> 56:16.500\n But what I'm saying is if you have a hand engineered,\n\n56:16.500 --> 56:19.420\n if your perception system output can\n\n56:19.420 --> 56:22.980\n be written in a spec document, it is incomplete.\n\n56:22.980 --> 56:27.740\n Yeah, I mean, certainly, it's hard to argue with that\n\n56:27.740 --> 56:30.100\n because in the end, that's going to be true.\n\n56:30.100 --> 56:32.260\n Yeah, and I'll tell you what the output of our perception\n\n56:32.260 --> 56:32.740\n system is.\n\n56:32.740 --> 56:33.300\n What's that?\n\n56:33.300 --> 56:37.940\n It's a 1,024 dimensional vector, trained by neural net.\n\n56:37.940 --> 56:38.980\n Oh, you know that.\n\n56:38.980 --> 56:43.460\n No, it's 1,024 dimensions of who knows what.\n\n56:43.460 --> 56:45.060\n Because it's operating on real data.\n\n56:45.060 --> 56:46.940\n Yeah.\n\n56:46.940 --> 56:48.340\n And that's the perception.\n\n56:48.340 --> 56:50.380\n That's the perception state.\n\n56:50.380 --> 56:53.500\n Think about an autoencoder for faces.\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:56.660\n If you have an autoencoder for faces and you say\n\n56:56.660 --> 56:59.260\n it has 256 dimensions in the middle,\n\n56:59.260 --> 57:01.260\n and I'm taking a face over here and projecting it\n\n57:01.260 --> 57:02.820\n to a face over here.\n\n57:02.820 --> 57:06.300\n Can you hand label all 256 of those dimensions?\n\n57:06.300 --> 57:09.260\n Well, no, but those have to generate automatically.\n\n57:09.260 --> 57:11.380\n But even if you tried to do it by hand,\n\n57:11.380 --> 57:15.580\n could you come up with a spec between your encoder\n\n57:15.580 --> 57:17.660\n and your decoder?\n\n57:17.660 --> 57:20.740\n No, because it wasn't designed, but there.\n\n57:20.740 --> 57:23.620\n No, no, no, but if you could design it.\n\n57:23.620 --> 57:26.460\n If you could design a face reconstructor system,\n\n57:26.460 --> 57:29.260\n could you come up with a spec?\n\n57:29.260 --> 57:32.340\n No, but I think we're missing here a little bit.\n\n57:32.340 --> 57:35.980\n I think you're just being very poetic about expressing\n\n57:35.980 --> 57:38.940\n a fundamental problem of simulators,\n\n57:38.940 --> 57:44.300\n that they're going to be missing so much that the feature\n\n57:44.300 --> 57:47.500\n vector will just look fundamentally different\n\n57:47.500 --> 57:51.260\n in the simulated world than the real world.\n\n57:51.260 --> 57:53.820\n I'm not making a claim about simulators.\n\n57:53.820 --> 57:57.060\n I'm making a claim about the spec division\n\n57:57.060 --> 58:00.780\n between perception and planning, even in your system.\n\n58:00.780 --> 58:01.980\n Just in general.\n\n58:01.980 --> 58:03.300\n Just in general.\n\n58:03.300 --> 58:05.620\n If you're trying to build a car that drives,\n\n58:05.620 --> 58:08.340\n if you're trying to hand code the output of your perception\n\n58:08.340 --> 58:10.340\n system, like saying, here's a list of all the cars\n\n58:10.340 --> 58:11.860\n in the scene, here's a list of all the people,\n\n58:11.860 --> 58:13.060\n here's a list of the occluded areas,\n\n58:13.060 --> 58:16.540\n here's a vector of drivable areas, it's insufficient.\n\n58:16.540 --> 58:17.900\n And if you start to believe that,\n\n58:17.900 --> 58:20.780\n you realize that what Waymo and Cruz are doing is impossible.\n\n58:20.780 --> 58:24.220\n Currently, what we're doing is the perception problem\n\n58:24.220 --> 58:29.140\n is converting the scene into a chessboard.\n\n58:29.140 --> 58:31.660\n And then you reason some basic reasoning\n\n58:31.660 --> 58:33.340\n around that chessboard.\n\n58:33.340 --> 58:38.380\n And you're saying that really, there's a lot missing there.\n\n58:38.380 --> 58:40.180\n First of all, why are we talking about this?\n\n58:40.180 --> 58:42.740\n Because isn't this a full autonomy?\n\n58:42.740 --> 58:44.580\n Is this something you think about?\n\n58:44.580 --> 58:47.540\n Oh, I want to win self driving cars.\n\n58:47.540 --> 58:51.940\n So your definition of win includes?\n\n58:51.940 --> 58:53.060\n Level four or five.\n\n58:53.060 --> 58:53.900\n Level five.\n\n58:53.900 --> 58:55.740\n I don't think level four is a real thing.\n\n58:55.740 --> 58:59.660\n I want to build the AlphaGo of driving.\n\n59:01.060 --> 59:06.060\n So AlphaGo is really end to end.\n\n59:06.060 --> 59:06.900\n Yeah.\n\n59:06.900 --> 59:09.780\n Is, yeah, it's end to end.\n\n59:09.780 --> 59:12.420\n And do you think this whole problem,\n\n59:12.420 --> 59:14.620\n is that also kind of what you're getting at\n\n59:14.620 --> 59:16.580\n with the perception and the planning?\n\n59:16.580 --> 59:19.380\n Is that this whole problem, the right way to do it\n\n59:19.380 --> 59:21.540\n is really to learn the entire thing.\n\n59:21.540 --> 59:23.620\n I'll argue that not only is it the right way,\n\n59:23.620 --> 59:27.620\n it's the only way that's going to exceed human performance.\n\n59:27.620 --> 59:28.540\n Well.\n\n59:28.540 --> 59:29.940\n It's certainly true for Go.\n\n59:29.940 --> 59:31.460\n Everyone who tried to hand code Go things\n\n59:31.460 --> 59:33.420\n built human inferior things.\n\n59:33.420 --> 59:36.180\n And then someone came along and wrote some 10,000 line thing\n\n59:36.180 --> 59:39.780\n that doesn't know anything about Go that beat everybody.\n\n59:39.780 --> 59:41.060\n It's 10,000 lines.\n\n59:41.060 --> 59:44.500\n True, in that sense, the open question then\n\n59:44.500 --> 59:49.500\n that maybe I can ask you is driving is much harder than Go.\n\n59:53.460 --> 59:55.420\n The open question is how much harder?\n\n59:56.260 --> 59:59.500\n So how, because I think the Elon Musk approach here\n\n59:59.500 --> 1:00:01.620\n with planning and perception is similar\n\n1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:02.980\n to what you're describing,\n\n1:00:02.980 --> 1:00:07.980\n which is really turning into not some kind of modular thing,\n\n1:00:08.300 --> 1:00:11.140\n but really do formulate it as a learning problem\n\n1:00:11.140 --> 1:00:13.380\n and solve the learning problem with scale.\n\n1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:17.700\n So how many years, put one is how many years\n\n1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:18.860\n would it take to solve this problem\n\n1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:21.660\n or just how hard is this freaking problem?\n\n1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:26.660\n Well, the cool thing is I think there's a lot of value\n\n1:00:27.780 --> 1:00:29.740\n that we can deliver along the way.\n\n1:00:30.820 --> 1:00:35.820\n I think that you can build lane keeping assist actually\n\n1:00:37.260 --> 1:00:42.260\n plus adaptive cruise control, plus, okay, looking at ways,\n\n1:00:42.260 --> 1:00:45.980\n extends to like all of driving.\n\n1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:47.900\n Yeah, most of driving, right?\n\n1:00:47.900 --> 1:00:49.740\n Oh, your adaptive cruise control treats red lights\n\n1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:51.180\n like cars, okay.\n\n1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:52.980\n So let's jump around.\n\n1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:55.740\n You mentioned that you didn't like navigate an autopilot.\n\n1:00:55.740 --> 1:00:57.740\n What advice, how would you make it better?\n\n1:00:57.740 --> 1:01:00.540\n Do you think as a feature that if it's done really well,\n\n1:01:00.540 --> 1:01:02.340\n it's a good feature?\n\n1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:07.340\n I think that it's too reliant on like hand coded hacks\n\n1:01:07.460 --> 1:01:10.380\n for like, how does navigate an autopilot do a lane change?\n\n1:01:10.380 --> 1:01:13.340\n It actually does the same lane change every time\n\n1:01:13.340 --> 1:01:14.260\n and it feels mechanical.\n\n1:01:14.260 --> 1:01:15.820\n Humans do different lane changes.\n\n1:01:15.820 --> 1:01:17.300\n Humans sometime will do a slow one,\n\n1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:18.860\n sometimes do a fast one.\n\n1:01:18.860 --> 1:01:20.820\n Navigate an autopilot, at least every time I use it,\n\n1:01:20.820 --> 1:01:22.980\n it is the identical lane change.\n\n1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:24.220\n How do you learn?\n\n1:01:24.220 --> 1:01:26.740\n I mean, this is a fundamental thing actually\n\n1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:30.340\n is the braking and then accelerating\n\n1:01:30.340 --> 1:01:33.900\n something that's still, Tesla probably does it better\n\n1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:36.740\n than most cars, but it still doesn't do a great job\n\n1:01:36.740 --> 1:01:39.900\n of creating a comfortable natural experience.\n\n1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:42.620\n And navigate an autopilot is just lane changes\n\n1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:44.060\n and extension of that.\n\n1:01:44.060 --> 1:01:49.060\n So how do you learn to do a natural lane change?\n\n1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:52.980\n So we have it and I can talk about how it works.\n\n1:01:52.980 --> 1:01:57.980\n So I feel that we have the solution for lateral.\n\n1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:00.700\n We don't yet have the solution for longitudinal.\n\n1:02:00.700 --> 1:02:03.420\n There's a few reasons longitudinal is harder than lateral.\n\n1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:05.180\n The lane change component,\n\n1:02:05.180 --> 1:02:08.060\n the way that we train on it very simply\n\n1:02:08.060 --> 1:02:10.900\n is like our model has an input\n\n1:02:10.900 --> 1:02:14.100\n for whether it's doing a lane change or not.\n\n1:02:14.100 --> 1:02:16.420\n And then when we train the end to end model,\n\n1:02:16.420 --> 1:02:18.420\n we hand label all the lane changes,\n\n1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:19.580\n cause you have to.\n\n1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:22.460\n I've struggled a long time about not wanting to do that,\n\n1:02:22.460 --> 1:02:24.300\n but I think you have to.\n\n1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:25.340\n Or the training data.\n\n1:02:25.340 --> 1:02:26.540\n For the training data, right?\n\n1:02:26.540 --> 1:02:28.380\n Oh, we actually, we have an automatic ground truther\n\n1:02:28.380 --> 1:02:30.580\n which automatically labels all the lane changes.\n\n1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:31.700\n Was that possible?\n\n1:02:31.700 --> 1:02:32.780\n To automatically label the lane changes?\n\n1:02:32.780 --> 1:02:33.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:34.820\n Yeah, detect the lane, I see when it crosses it, right?\n\n1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:36.700\n And I don't have to get that high percent accuracy,\n\n1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:38.980\n but it's like 95, good enough.\n\n1:02:38.980 --> 1:02:43.220\n Now I set the bit when it's doing the lane change\n\n1:02:43.220 --> 1:02:44.860\n in the end to end learning.\n\n1:02:44.860 --> 1:02:47.940\n And then I set it to zero when it's not doing a lane change.\n\n1:02:47.940 --> 1:02:49.740\n So now if I wanted to do a lane change at test time,\n\n1:02:49.740 --> 1:02:52.380\n I just put the bit to a one and it'll do a lane change.\n\n1:02:52.380 --> 1:02:54.660\n Yeah, but so if you look at the space of lane change,\n\n1:02:54.660 --> 1:02:57.340\n you know, some percentage, not a hundred percent\n\n1:02:57.340 --> 1:03:01.140\n that we make as humans is not a pleasant experience\n\n1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:02.860\n cause we messed some part of it up.\n\n1:03:02.860 --> 1:03:04.940\n It's nerve wracking to change the look,\n\n1:03:04.940 --> 1:03:06.940\n you have to see, it has to accelerate.\n\n1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:09.940\n How do we label the ones that are natural and feel good?\n\n1:03:09.940 --> 1:03:13.380\n You know, that's the, cause that's your ultimate criticism.\n\n1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:15.860\n The current navigate and autopilot\n\n1:03:15.860 --> 1:03:16.940\n just doesn't feel good.\n\n1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:18.460\n Well, the current navigate and autopilot\n\n1:03:18.460 --> 1:03:21.660\n is a hand coded policy written by an engineer in a room\n\n1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:25.020\n who probably went out and tested it a few times on the 280.\n\n1:03:25.020 --> 1:03:29.420\n Probably a more, a better version of that, but yes.\n\n1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:31.020\n That's how we would have written it at Comma AI.\n\n1:03:31.020 --> 1:03:31.860\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:03:31.860 --> 1:03:33.420\n Maybe Tesla did, Tesla, they tested it in the end.\n\n1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:35.100\n That might've been two engineers.\n\n1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:36.060\n Two engineers, yeah.\n\n1:03:37.380 --> 1:03:40.060\n No, but so if you learn the lane change,\n\n1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:42.420\n if you learn how to do a lane change from data,\n\n1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.660\n just like you have a label that says lane change\n\n1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:46.380\n and then you put it in when you want it\n\n1:03:46.380 --> 1:03:48.020\n to do the lane change,\n\n1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:49.620\n it'll automatically do the lane change\n\n1:03:49.620 --> 1:03:51.580\n that's appropriate for the situation.\n\n1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:54.700\n Now, to get at the problem of some humans\n\n1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:55.940\n do bad lane changes,\n\n1:03:57.380 --> 1:03:59.900\n we haven't worked too much on this problem yet.\n\n1:03:59.900 --> 1:04:03.100\n It's not that much of a problem in practice.\n\n1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:06.140\n My theory is that all good drivers are good in the same way\n\n1:04:06.140 --> 1:04:08.340\n and all bad drivers are bad in different ways.\n\n1:04:09.340 --> 1:04:11.300\n And we've seen some data to back this up.\n\n1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:12.380\n Well, beautifully put.\n\n1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:16.540\n So you just basically, if that's true hypothesis,\n\n1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:19.860\n then your task is to discover the good drivers.\n\n1:04:19.860 --> 1:04:23.300\n The good drivers stand out because they're in one cluster\n\n1:04:23.300 --> 1:04:25.140\n and the bad drivers are scattered all over the place\n\n1:04:25.140 --> 1:04:27.180\n and your net learns the cluster.\n\n1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.740\n Yeah, that's, so you just learn from the good drivers\n\n1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:33.140\n and they're easy to cluster.\n\n1:04:33.140 --> 1:04:33.980\n In fact, we learned from all of them\n\n1:04:33.980 --> 1:04:35.780\n and the net automatically learns the policy\n\n1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:36.860\n that's like the majority,\n\n1:04:36.860 --> 1:04:38.500\n but we'll eventually probably have to filter them out.\n\n1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:41.500\n If that theory is true, I hope it's true\n\n1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:46.420\n because the counter theory is there is many clusters,\n\n1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:53.620\n maybe arbitrarily many clusters of good drivers.\n\n1:04:53.620 --> 1:04:55.780\n Because if there's one cluster of good drivers,\n\n1:04:55.780 --> 1:04:57.540\n you can at least discover a set of policies.\n\n1:04:57.540 --> 1:04:58.940\n You can learn a set of policies,\n\n1:04:58.940 --> 1:05:00.580\n which would be good universally.\n\n1:05:00.580 --> 1:05:01.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:01.620 --> 1:05:04.540\n That would be a nice, that would be nice if it's true.\n\n1:05:04.540 --> 1:05:06.540\n And you're saying that there is some evidence that.\n\n1:05:06.540 --> 1:05:09.740\n Let's say lane changes can be clustered into four clusters.\n\n1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:10.580\n Right. Right.\n\n1:05:10.580 --> 1:05:12.020\n There's this finite level of.\n\n1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:15.260\n I would argue that all four of those are good clusters.\n\n1:05:15.260 --> 1:05:18.420\n All the things that are random are noise and probably bad.\n\n1:05:18.420 --> 1:05:20.340\n And which one of the four you pick,\n\n1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:21.900\n or maybe it's 10 or maybe it's 20.\n\n1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:22.740\n You can learn that.\n\n1:05:22.740 --> 1:05:23.780\n It's context dependent.\n\n1:05:23.780 --> 1:05:24.980\n It depends on the scene.\n\n1:05:24.980 --> 1:05:29.980\n And the hope is it's not too dependent on the driver.\n\n1:05:31.380 --> 1:05:34.220\n Yeah. The hope is that it all washes out.\n\n1:05:34.220 --> 1:05:36.980\n The hope is that there's, that the distribution's not bimodal.\n\n1:05:36.980 --> 1:05:39.100\n The hope is that it's a nice Gaussian.\n\n1:05:39.100 --> 1:05:41.660\n So what advice would you give to Tesla,\n\n1:05:41.660 --> 1:05:44.980\n how to fix, how to improve navigating autopilot?\n\n1:05:44.980 --> 1:05:48.260\n That's the lessons that you've learned from Comm AI?\n\n1:05:48.260 --> 1:05:50.580\n The only real advice I would give to Tesla\n\n1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:52.940\n is please put driver monitoring in your cars.\n\n1:05:52.940 --> 1:05:55.100\n With respect to improving it?\n\n1:05:55.100 --> 1:05:55.940\n You can't do that anymore.\n\n1:05:55.940 --> 1:05:58.220\n I decided to interrupt, but you know,\n\n1:05:58.220 --> 1:06:01.740\n there's a practical nature of many of hundreds of thousands\n\n1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:04.180\n of cars being produced that don't have\n\n1:06:04.180 --> 1:06:05.780\n a good driver facing camera.\n\n1:06:05.780 --> 1:06:07.500\n The Model 3 has a selfie cam.\n\n1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:08.660\n Is it not good enough?\n\n1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:10.780\n Did they not put IR LEDs for night?\n\n1:06:10.780 --> 1:06:11.620\n That's a good question.\n\n1:06:11.620 --> 1:06:13.340\n But I do know that it's fisheye\n\n1:06:13.340 --> 1:06:15.780\n and it's relatively low resolution.\n\n1:06:15.780 --> 1:06:16.740\n So it's really not designed.\n\n1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:17.580\n It wasn't.\n\n1:06:17.580 --> 1:06:18.740\n It wasn't designed for driver monitoring.\n\n1:06:18.740 --> 1:06:21.740\n You can hope that you can kind of scrape up\n\n1:06:21.740 --> 1:06:24.180\n and have something from it.\n\n1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:25.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.500\n But why didn't they put it in today?\n\n1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:28.340\n Put it in today.\n\n1:06:28.340 --> 1:06:29.500\n Put it in today.\n\n1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:31.500\n Every time I've heard Karpathy talk about the problem\n\n1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:33.220\n and talking about like software 2.0\n\n1:06:33.220 --> 1:06:35.220\n and how the machine learning is gobbling up everything,\n\n1:06:35.220 --> 1:06:37.420\n I think this is absolutely the right strategy.\n\n1:06:37.420 --> 1:06:40.140\n I think that he didn't write navigate on autopilot.\n\n1:06:40.140 --> 1:06:41.540\n I think somebody else did\n\n1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:43.220\n and kind of hacked it on top of that stuff.\n\n1:06:43.220 --> 1:06:45.700\n I think when Karpathy says, wait a second,\n\n1:06:45.700 --> 1:06:47.420\n why did we hand code this lane change policy\n\n1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:48.340\n with all these magic numbers?\n\n1:06:48.340 --> 1:06:49.340\n We're gonna learn it from data.\n\n1:06:49.340 --> 1:06:50.180\n They'll fix it.\n\n1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:51.060\n They already know what to do there.\n\n1:06:51.060 --> 1:06:53.380\n Well, that's Andrei's job\n\n1:06:53.380 --> 1:06:55.780\n is to turn everything into a learning problem\n\n1:06:55.780 --> 1:06:57.500\n and collect a huge amount of data.\n\n1:06:57.500 --> 1:06:59.540\n The reality is though,\n\n1:06:59.540 --> 1:07:02.780\n not every problem can be turned into a learning problem\n\n1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:04.100\n in the short term.\n\n1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:07.300\n In the end, everything will be a learning problem.\n\n1:07:07.300 --> 1:07:12.300\n The reality is like if you wanna build L5 vehicles today,\n\n1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:15.460\n it will likely involve no learning.\n\n1:07:15.460 --> 1:07:17.420\n And that's the reality is,\n\n1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:20.340\n so at which point does learning start?\n\n1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:23.500\n It's the crutch statement that LiDAR is a crutch.\n\n1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:24.860\n At which point will learning\n\n1:07:24.860 --> 1:07:27.260\n get up to part of human performance?\n\n1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:29.980\n It's over human performance on ImageNet,\n\n1:07:30.980 --> 1:07:34.060\n classification, on driving, it's a question still.\n\n1:07:34.060 --> 1:07:35.820\n It is a question.\n\n1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.260\n I'll say this, I'm here to play for 10 years.\n\n1:07:39.260 --> 1:07:40.340\n I'm not here to try to,\n\n1:07:40.340 --> 1:07:43.020\n I'm here to play for 10 years and make money along the way.\n\n1:07:43.020 --> 1:07:45.100\n I'm not here to try to promise people\n\n1:07:45.100 --> 1:07:47.060\n that I'm gonna have my L5 taxi network\n\n1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:48.300\n up and working in two years.\n\n1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:49.500\n Do you think that was a mistake?\n\n1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:50.580\n Yes.\n\n1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:53.540\n What do you think was the motivation behind saying that?\n\n1:07:53.540 --> 1:07:56.700\n Other companies are also promising L5 vehicles\n\n1:07:56.700 --> 1:08:01.700\n with very different approaches in 2020, 2021, 2022.\n\n1:08:01.940 --> 1:08:03.740\n If anybody would like to bet me\n\n1:08:03.740 --> 1:08:06.940\n that those things do not pan out, I will bet you.\n\n1:08:06.940 --> 1:08:09.780\n Even money, even money, I'll bet you as much as you want.\n\n1:08:09.780 --> 1:08:10.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:13.660\n So are you worried about what's going to happen?\n\n1:08:13.660 --> 1:08:16.140\n Cause you're not in full agreement on that.\n\n1:08:16.140 --> 1:08:19.180\n What's going to happen when 2022, 21 come around\n\n1:08:19.180 --> 1:08:22.900\n and nobody has fleets of autonomous vehicles?\n\n1:08:22.900 --> 1:08:25.060\n Well, you can look at the history.\n\n1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:26.740\n If you go back five years ago,\n\n1:08:26.740 --> 1:08:29.980\n they were all promised by 2018 and 2017.\n\n1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.260\n But they weren't that strong of promises.\n\n1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:36.260\n I mean, Ford really declared pretty,\n\n1:08:36.260 --> 1:08:40.640\n I think not many have declared as like definitively\n\n1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:42.660\n as they have now these dates.\n\n1:08:42.660 --> 1:08:45.100\n Well, okay, so let's separate L4 and L5.\n\n1:08:45.100 --> 1:08:49.480\n Do I think that it's possible for Waymo to continue to kind\n\n1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:51.020\n of like hack on their system\n\n1:08:51.020 --> 1:08:53.460\n until it gets to level four in Chandler, Arizona?\n\n1:08:53.460 --> 1:08:55.060\n Yes.\n\n1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.860\n When there's no safety driver?\n\n1:08:56.860 --> 1:08:57.700\n Chandler, Arizona?\n\n1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:58.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:59.580 --> 1:09:02.540\n By, sorry, which year are we talking about?\n\n1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:06.180\n Oh, I even think that's possible by like 2020, 2021.\n\n1:09:06.180 --> 1:09:08.460\n But level four, Chandler, Arizona,\n\n1:09:08.460 --> 1:09:10.340\n not level five, New York City.\n\n1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:15.340\n Level four, meaning some very defined streets,\n\n1:09:15.980 --> 1:09:17.460\n it works out really well.\n\n1:09:17.460 --> 1:09:18.300\n Very defined streets.\n\n1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:20.720\n And then practically these streets are pretty empty.\n\n1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:24.700\n If most of the streets are covered in Waymo's,\n\n1:09:24.700 --> 1:09:28.420\n Waymo can kind of change the definition of what driving is.\n\n1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:29.260\n Right?\n\n1:09:29.260 --> 1:09:30.980\n If your self driving network\n\n1:09:30.980 --> 1:09:33.460\n is the majority of cars in an area,\n\n1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:35.740\n they only need to be safe with respect to each other\n\n1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:38.660\n and all the humans will need to learn to adapt to them.\n\n1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:41.140\n Now go drive in downtown New York.\n\n1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:42.220\n Well, yeah, that's.\n\n1:09:42.220 --> 1:09:44.780\n I mean, already you can talk about autonomy\n\n1:09:44.780 --> 1:09:46.980\n and like on farms, it already works great\n\n1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:49.580\n because you can really just follow the GPS line.\n\n1:09:51.300 --> 1:09:55.640\n So what does success look like for common AI?\n\n1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:57.900\n What are the milestones?\n\n1:09:57.900 --> 1:09:59.820\n Like where you can sit back with some champagne\n\n1:09:59.820 --> 1:10:02.860\n and say, we did it, boys and girls?\n\n1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:06.260\n Well, it's never over.\n\n1:10:06.260 --> 1:10:07.300\n Yeah, but.\n\n1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:10.420\n You must drink champagne and celebrate.\n\n1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:13.180\n So what is a good, what are some wins?\n\n1:10:13.180 --> 1:10:15.940\n A big milestone that we're hoping for\n\n1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:20.880\n by mid next year is profitability of the company.\n\n1:10:23.580 --> 1:10:27.680\n And we're gonna have to revisit the idea\n\n1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:30.320\n of selling a consumer product,\n\n1:10:30.320 --> 1:10:32.740\n but it's not gonna be like the comma one.\n\n1:10:32.740 --> 1:10:35.320\n When we do it, it's gonna be perfect.\n\n1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:39.640\n Open pilot has gotten so much better in the last two years.\n\n1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:41.720\n We're gonna have a few features.\n\n1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:43.800\n We're gonna have a hundred percent driver monitoring.\n\n1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:47.120\n We're gonna disable no safety features in the car.\n\n1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:48.280\n Actually, I think it'd be really cool\n\n1:10:48.280 --> 1:10:49.160\n what we're doing right now.\n\n1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:51.640\n Our project this week is we're analyzing the data set\n\n1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:53.240\n and looking for all the AEB triggers\n\n1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.640\n from the manufacturer systems.\n\n1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:59.440\n We have better data set on that than the manufacturers.\n\n1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:00.920\n How much, just how many,\n\n1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:03.360\n does Toyota have 10 million miles of real world driving\n\n1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:05.320\n to know how many times their AEB triggered?\n\n1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:08.400\n So let me give you, cause you asked, right?\n\n1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:09.560\n Financial advice.\n\n1:11:09.560 --> 1:11:10.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.400\n Cause I work with a lot of automakers\n\n1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:15.800\n and one possible source of money for you,\n\n1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:18.040\n which I'll be excited to see you take on\n\n1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:23.040\n is basically selling the data.\n\n1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:29.120\n So, which is something that most people,\n\n1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:31.800\n and not selling in a way where here, here at Automaker,\n\n1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:34.360\n but creating, we've done this actually at MIT,\n\n1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:35.480\n not for money purposes,\n\n1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:37.760\n but you could do it for significant money purposes\n\n1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:41.360\n and make the world a better place by creating a consortia\n\n1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:44.200\n where automakers would pay in\n\n1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:46.960\n and then they get to have free access to the data.\n\n1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:51.440\n And I think a lot of people are really hungry for that\n\n1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:54.200\n and would pay significant amount of money for it.\n\n1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:55.400\n Here's the problem with that.\n\n1:11:55.400 --> 1:11:56.880\n I like this idea all in theory.\n\n1:11:56.880 --> 1:11:59.660\n It'd be very easy for me to give them access to my servers\n\n1:11:59.660 --> 1:12:01.480\n and we already have all open source tools\n\n1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:02.320\n to access this data.\n\n1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:03.440\n It's in a great format.\n\n1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:04.720\n We have a great pipeline,\n\n1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:07.120\n but they're gonna put me in the room\n\n1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:08.920\n with some business development guy.\n\n1:12:10.140 --> 1:12:12.560\n And I'm gonna have to talk to this guy\n\n1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:15.200\n and he's not gonna know most of the words I'm saying.\n\n1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:17.400\n I'm not willing to tolerate that.\n\n1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:18.960\n Okay, Mick Jagger.\n\n1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:19.800\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:21.120\n I think I agree with you.\n\n1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:23.040\n I'm the same way, but you just tell them the terms\n\n1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:24.720\n and there's no discussion needed.\n\n1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:28.080\n If I could just tell them the terms,\n\n1:12:28.080 --> 1:12:28.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:31.720\n and like, all right, who wants access to my data?\n\n1:12:31.720 --> 1:12:36.720\n I will sell it to you for, let's say,\n\n1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:37.720\n you want a subscription?\n\n1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.560\n I'll sell to you for 100K a month.\n\n1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:41.640\n Anyone.\n\n1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:42.480\n 100K a month.\n\n1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:43.300\n 100K a month.\n\n1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:45.160\n I'll give you access to this data subscription.\n\n1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:46.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:46.820\n Yeah, I think that's kind of fair.\n\n1:12:46.820 --> 1:12:48.080\n Came up with that number off the top of my head.\n\n1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:50.200\n If somebody sends me like a three line email\n\n1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:52.600\n where it's like, we would like to pay 100K a month\n\n1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:54.040\n to get access to your data.\n\n1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:56.180\n We would agree to like reasonable privacy terms\n\n1:12:56.180 --> 1:12:58.360\n of the people who are in the data set.\n\n1:12:58.360 --> 1:12:59.560\n I would be happy to do it,\n\n1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:01.200\n but that's not going to be the email.\n\n1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:02.880\n The email is going to be, hey,\n\n1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:04.680\n do you have some time in the next month\n\n1:13:04.680 --> 1:13:06.000\n where we can sit down and we can,\n\n1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:06.880\n I don't have time for that.\n\n1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:07.880\n We're moving too fast.\n\n1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:08.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:10.080\n You could politely respond to that email,\n\n1:13:10.080 --> 1:13:13.280\n but not saying, I don't have any time for your bullshit.\n\n1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.480\n You say, oh, well, unfortunately these are the terms.\n\n1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:17.720\n And so this is, we try to,\n\n1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:19.840\n we brought the cost down for you\n\n1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:22.480\n in order to minimize the friction and communication.\n\n1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:23.320\n Absolutely.\n\n1:13:23.320 --> 1:13:24.520\n Here's the, whatever it is,\n\n1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:28.960\n one, two million dollars a year and you have access.\n\n1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:31.460\n And it's not like I get that email from like,\n\n1:13:31.460 --> 1:13:32.720\n but okay, am I going to reach out?\n\n1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:34.200\n Am I going to hire a business development person\n\n1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:35.920\n who's going to reach out to the automakers?\n\n1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:36.740\n No way.\n\n1:13:36.740 --> 1:13:37.580\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:38.400\n I got you.\n\n1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:40.640\n If they reached into me, I'm not going to ignore the email.\n\n1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:41.960\n I'll come back with something like,\n\n1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:43.920\n yeah, if you're willing to pay 100K a month\n\n1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:46.120\n for access to the data, I'm happy to set that up.\n\n1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:48.240\n That's worth my engineering time.\n\n1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:49.560\n That's actually quite insightful of you.\n\n1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:50.480\n You're right.\n\n1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:52.520\n Probably because many of the automakers\n\n1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:54.200\n are quite a bit old school,\n\n1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:57.680\n there will be a need to reach out and they want it,\n\n1:13:57.680 --> 1:13:59.800\n but there'll need to be some communication.\n\n1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:00.640\n You're right.\n\n1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:04.520\n Mobileye circa 2015 had the lowest R&D spend\n\n1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:08.360\n of any chip maker, like per, per,\n\n1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:10.640\n and you look at all the people who work for them\n\n1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.120\n and it's all business development people\n\n1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:15.340\n because the car companies are impossible to work with.\n\n1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:16.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:16.180 --> 1:14:17.880\n So you're, you have no patience for that\n\n1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:20.040\n and you're, you're legit Android, huh?\n\n1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:21.400\n I have something to do, right?\n\n1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:22.520\n Like, like it's not like, it's not like,\n\n1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:23.760\n I don't, like, I don't mean to like be a dick\n\n1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.120\n and say like, I don't have patience for that,\n\n1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:28.280\n but it's like that stuff doesn't help us\n\n1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:30.560\n with our goal of winning self driving cars.\n\n1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:32.280\n If I want money in the short term,\n\n1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.080\n if I showed off like the actual,\n\n1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:38.080\n like the learning tech that we have,\n\n1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.580\n it's, it's somewhat sad.\n\n1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:42.720\n Like it's years and years ahead of everybody else's.\n\n1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:43.720\n Not to, maybe not Tesla's.\n\n1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:45.280\n I think Tesla has some more stuff to us actually.\n\n1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:46.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:46.940\n I think Tesla has similar stuff,\n\n1:14:46.940 --> 1:14:47.940\n but when you compare it to like\n\n1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:49.840\n what the Toyota Research Institute has,\n\n1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:53.480\n you're not even close to what we have.\n\n1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:54.360\n No comments.\n\n1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:58.480\n But I also can't, I have to take your comments.\n\n1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:01.640\n I intuitively believe you,\n\n1:15:01.640 --> 1:15:03.240\n but I have to take it with a grain of salt\n\n1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.200\n because I mean, you are an inspiration\n\n1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:09.040\n because you basically don't care about a lot of things\n\n1:15:09.040 --> 1:15:10.840\n that other companies care about.\n\n1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.560\n You don't try to bullshit in a sense,\n\n1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:16.640\n like make up stuff.\n\n1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:19.720\n So to drive up valuation, you're really very real\n\n1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:20.920\n and you're trying to solve the problem\n\n1:15:20.920 --> 1:15:22.280\n and admire that a lot.\n\n1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:25.960\n What I don't necessarily fully can't trust you on,\n\n1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:28.440\n with all due respect, is how good it is, right?\n\n1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:32.460\n I can only, but I also know how bad others are.\n\n1:15:32.460 --> 1:15:33.300\n And so.\n\n1:15:33.300 --> 1:15:36.680\n I'll say two things about, trust but verify, right?\n\n1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:38.040\n I'll say two things about that.\n\n1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:42.360\n One is try, get in a 2020 Corolla\n\n1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:45.420\n and try open pilot 0.6 when it comes out next month.\n\n1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:48.400\n I think already you'll look at this\n\n1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:51.200\n and you'll be like, this is already really good.\n\n1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:54.280\n And then I could be doing that all with hand labelers\n\n1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:57.960\n and all with like the same approach that Mobileye uses.\n\n1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:01.440\n When we release a model that no longer has the lanes in it,\n\n1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:03.420\n that only outputs a path,\n\n1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:08.680\n then think about how we did that machine learning\n\n1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:10.080\n and then right away when you see,\n\n1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:11.240\n and that's gonna be an open pilot,\n\n1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:13.000\n that's gonna be an open pilot before 1.0.\n\n1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:14.080\n When you see that model,\n\n1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:15.400\n you'll know that everything I'm saying is true\n\n1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:16.840\n because how else did I get that model?\n\n1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:17.680\n Good.\n\n1:16:17.680 --> 1:16:19.240\n You know what I'm saying is true about the simulator.\n\n1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:22.680\n Yeah, yeah, this is super exciting, that's super exciting.\n\n1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:25.760\n But like, you know, I listened to your talk with Kyle\n\n1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:30.460\n and Kyle was originally building the aftermarket system\n\n1:16:30.460 --> 1:16:34.920\n and he gave up on it because of technical challenges,\n\n1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:38.160\n because of the fact that he's gonna have to support\n\n1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:40.520\n 20 to 50 cars, we support 45,\n\n1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:41.480\n because what is he gonna do\n\n1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.460\n when the manufacturer ABS system triggers?\n\n1:16:43.460 --> 1:16:45.520\n We have alerts and warnings to deal with all of that\n\n1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:46.600\n and all the cars.\n\n1:16:46.600 --> 1:16:48.440\n And how is he going to formally verify it?\n\n1:16:48.440 --> 1:16:49.840\n Well, I got 10 million miles of data,\n\n1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:50.680\n it's probably better,\n\n1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:53.240\n it's probably better verified than the spec.\n\n1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:57.000\n Yeah, I'm glad you're here talking to me.\n\n1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.280\n This is, I'll remember this day,\n\n1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:01.120\n because it's interesting.\n\n1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:04.140\n If you look at Kyle's from cruise,\n\n1:17:04.140 --> 1:17:05.320\n I'm sure they have a large number\n\n1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:07.400\n of business development folks\n\n1:17:07.400 --> 1:17:10.200\n and you work with, he's working with GM,\n\n1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:13.240\n you could work with Argo AI, working with Ford.\n\n1:17:13.240 --> 1:17:17.560\n It's interesting because chances that you fail,\n\n1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:20.160\n business wise, like bankrupt, are pretty high.\n\n1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:21.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:23.880\n And yet, it's the Android model,\n\n1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:26.340\n is you're actually taking on the problem.\n\n1:17:26.340 --> 1:17:28.200\n So that's really inspiring, I mean.\n\n1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:30.920\n Well, I have a long term way for Comma to make money too.\n\n1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:32.180\n And one of the nice things\n\n1:17:32.180 --> 1:17:34.400\n when you really take on the problem,\n\n1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:36.760\n which is my hope for Autopilot, for example,\n\n1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:39.560\n is things you don't expect,\n\n1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:41.840\n ways to make money or create value\n\n1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:43.960\n that you don't expect will pop up.\n\n1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:46.640\n Oh, I've known how to do it since kind of,\n\n1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.520\n 2017 is the first time I said it.\n\n1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:50.440\n Which part, to know how to do which part?\n\n1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:52.480\n Our long term plan is to be a car insurance company.\n\n1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:55.280\n Insurance, yeah, I love it, yep, yep.\n\n1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:56.640\n I make driving twice as safe.\n\n1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:57.600\n Not only that, I have the best data\n\n1:17:57.600 --> 1:17:59.840\n such to know who statistically is the safest drivers.\n\n1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:03.700\n And oh, oh, we see you, we see you driving unsafely,\n\n1:18:03.700 --> 1:18:05.320\n we're not gonna insure you.\n\n1:18:05.320 --> 1:18:08.960\n And that causes a bifurcation in the market\n\n1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:10.880\n because the only people who can't get Comma insurance\n\n1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:12.740\n are the bad drivers, Geico can insure them,\n\n1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:13.860\n their premiums are crazy high,\n\n1:18:13.860 --> 1:18:15.320\n our premiums are crazy low.\n\n1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:18.040\n We'll win car insurance, take over that whole market.\n\n1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:19.920\n Okay, so.\n\n1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:21.240\n If we win, if we win.\n\n1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:22.080\n But that's what I'm saying,\n\n1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:24.080\n how do you turn Comma into a $10 billion company?\n\n1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:24.920\n It's that.\n\n1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:25.740\n That's right.\n\n1:18:25.740 --> 1:18:29.120\n So you, Elon Musk, who else?\n\n1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:32.700\n Who else is thinking like this and working like this\n\n1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:33.540\n in your view?\n\n1:18:33.540 --> 1:18:34.760\n Who are the competitors?\n\n1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.120\n Are there people seriously,\n\n1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:38.280\n I don't think anyone that I'm aware of\n\n1:18:38.280 --> 1:18:41.840\n is seriously taking on lane keeping,\n\n1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:45.100\n like where it's a huge business\n\n1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:47.160\n that turns eventually into full autonomy\n\n1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:52.000\n that then creates, yeah, like that creates other businesses\n\n1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.400\n on top of it and so on.\n\n1:18:53.400 --> 1:18:56.460\n Thinks insurance, thinks all kinds of ideas like that.\n\n1:18:56.460 --> 1:18:58.560\n Do you know anyone else thinking like this?\n\n1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:02.140\n Not really.\n\n1:19:02.140 --> 1:19:02.980\n That's interesting.\n\n1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.320\n I mean, my sense is everybody turns to that\n\n1:19:05.320 --> 1:19:07.760\n in like four or five years.\n\n1:19:07.760 --> 1:19:10.400\n Like Ford, once the autonomy doesn't fall through.\n\n1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:11.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:12.560\n But at this time.\n\n1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:14.100\n Elon's the iOS.\n\n1:19:14.100 --> 1:19:16.680\n By the way, he paved the way for all of us.\n\n1:19:16.680 --> 1:19:17.960\n It's the iOS, true.\n\n1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:20.840\n I would not be doing Comma AI today\n\n1:19:20.840 --> 1:19:23.440\n if it was not for those conversations with Elon.\n\n1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:27.080\n And if it were not for him saying like,\n\n1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:27.900\n I think he said like,\n\n1:19:27.900 --> 1:19:29.120\n well, obviously we're not gonna use LiDAR,\n\n1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.260\n we use cameras, humans use cameras.\n\n1:19:31.260 --> 1:19:32.560\n So what do you think about that?\n\n1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:33.880\n How important is LiDAR?\n\n1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:36.920\n Everybody else on L5 is using LiDAR.\n\n1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:39.200\n What are your thoughts on his provocative statement\n\n1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:41.320\n that LiDAR is a crutch?\n\n1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:43.040\n See, sometimes he'll say dumb things,\n\n1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:44.040\n like the driver monitoring thing,\n\n1:19:44.040 --> 1:19:46.240\n but sometimes he'll say absolutely, completely,\n\n1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:48.360\n 100% obviously true things.\n\n1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:49.780\n Of course LiDAR is a crutch.\n\n1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:53.020\n It's not even a good crutch.\n\n1:19:53.020 --> 1:19:53.860\n You're not even using it.\n\n1:19:53.860 --> 1:19:56.240\n Oh, they're using it for localization.\n\n1:19:56.240 --> 1:19:57.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:57.080 --> 1:19:58.140\n Which isn't good in the first place.\n\n1:19:58.140 --> 1:20:00.480\n If you have to localize your car to centimeters\n\n1:20:00.480 --> 1:20:04.280\n in order to drive, like that's not driving.\n\n1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:06.280\n Currently not doing much machine learning\n\n1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.560\n I thought for LiDAR data.\n\n1:20:07.560 --> 1:20:11.320\n Meaning like to help you in the task of,\n\n1:20:11.320 --> 1:20:12.840\n general task of perception.\n\n1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:15.320\n The main goal of those LiDARs on those cars\n\n1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:18.840\n I think is actually localization more than perception.\n\n1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:20.080\n Or at least that's what they use them for.\n\n1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:20.920\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:22.480\n If you want to localize to centimeters,\n\n1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:23.680\n you can't use GPS.\n\n1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:25.120\n The fanciest GPS in the world can't do it.\n\n1:20:25.120 --> 1:20:26.920\n Especially if you're under tree cover and stuff.\n\n1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:28.440\n With LiDAR you can do this pretty easily.\n\n1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:30.200\n So you really, they're not taking on,\n\n1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:33.160\n I mean in some research they're using it for perception,\n\n1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:35.800\n but, and they're certainly not, which is sad,\n\n1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:38.660\n they're not fusing it well with vision.\n\n1:20:38.660 --> 1:20:40.520\n They do use it for perception.\n\n1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:42.360\n I'm not saying they don't use it for perception,\n\n1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:45.440\n but the thing that, they have vision based\n\n1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:47.640\n and radar based perception systems as well.\n\n1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:51.400\n You could remove the LiDAR and keep around\n\n1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:54.000\n a lot of the dynamic object perception.\n\n1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.280\n You want to get centimeter accurate localization?\n\n1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:59.080\n Good luck doing that with anything else.\n\n1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:02.840\n So what should Cruz, Waymo do?\n\n1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:05.320\n Like what would be your advice to them now?\n\n1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.480\n I mean Waymo is actually,\n\n1:21:08.480 --> 1:21:11.640\n they're, I mean they're doing, they're serious.\n\n1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:14.120\n Waymo out of the ball of them are quite\n\n1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:16.280\n so serious about the long game.\n\n1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:20.800\n If L5 is a lot, requires 50 years,\n\n1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:24.160\n I think Waymo will be the only one left standing at the end\n\n1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:26.840\n with the, given the financial backing that they have.\n\n1:21:26.840 --> 1:21:28.800\n Buku Google bucks.\n\n1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:31.160\n I'll say nice things about both Waymo and Cruz.\n\n1:21:32.560 --> 1:21:33.640\n Let's do it.\n\n1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:34.480\n Nice is good.\n\n1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.360\n Waymo is by far the furthest along with technology.\n\n1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:42.920\n Waymo has a three to five year lead on all the competitors.\n\n1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.720\n If that, if the Waymo looking stack works,\n\n1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:49.760\n maybe three year lead.\n\n1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:51.320\n If the Waymo looking stack works,\n\n1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:52.880\n they have a three year lead.\n\n1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:55.840\n Now I argue that Waymo has spent too much money\n\n1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:59.280\n to recapitalize, to gain back their losses\n\n1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:00.200\n in those three years.\n\n1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:03.680\n Also self driving cars have no network effect like that.\n\n1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:04.840\n Uber has a network effect.\n\n1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:07.160\n You have a market, you have drivers and you have riders.\n\n1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:09.960\n Self driving cars, you have capital and you have riders.\n\n1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:11.480\n There's no network effect.\n\n1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:13.880\n If I want to blanket a new city in self driving cars,\n\n1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:16.080\n I buy the off the shelf Chinese knockoff self driving cars\n\n1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:17.240\n and I buy enough of them in the city.\n\n1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:18.400\n I can't do that with drivers.\n\n1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:20.920\n And that's why Uber has a first mover advantage\n\n1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:22.840\n that no self driving car company will.\n\n1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:26.600\n Can you disentangle that a little bit?\n\n1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:28.200\n Uber, you're not talking about Uber,\n\n1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:29.280\n the autonomous vehicle Uber.\n\n1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:31.640\n You're talking about the Uber car, the, yeah.\n\n1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:32.480\n I'm Uber.\n\n1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:36.000\n I open for business in Austin, Texas, let's say.\n\n1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.880\n I need to attract both sides of the market.\n\n1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:41.320\n I need to both get drivers on my platform\n\n1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:42.880\n and riders on my platform.\n\n1:22:42.880 --> 1:22:45.400\n And I need to keep them both sufficiently happy, right?\n\n1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:46.640\n Riders aren't gonna use it\n\n1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:49.080\n if it takes more than five minutes for an Uber to show up.\n\n1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:50.240\n Drivers aren't gonna use it\n\n1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:52.280\n if they have to sit around all day and there's no riders.\n\n1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:54.600\n So you have to carefully balance a market.\n\n1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:56.400\n And whenever you have to carefully balance a market,\n\n1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:58.400\n there's a great first mover advantage\n\n1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:01.120\n because there's a switching cost for everybody, right?\n\n1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:02.240\n The drivers and the riders\n\n1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:04.200\n would have to switch at the same time.\n\n1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:08.960\n Let's even say that, you know, let's say a Luber shows up\n\n1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:12.640\n and Luber somehow, you know, agrees to do things\n\n1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:15.800\n at a bigger, you know, we're just gonna,\n\n1:23:15.800 --> 1:23:17.520\n we've done it more efficiently, right?\n\n1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:19.880\n Luber is only takes 5% of a cut\n\n1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:21.680\n instead of the 10% that Uber takes.\n\n1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:22.840\n No one is gonna switch\n\n1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:25.000\n because the switching cost is higher than that 5%.\n\n1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.280\n So you actually can, in markets like that,\n\n1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:28.640\n you have a first mover advantage.\n\n1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:30.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:32.800\n Autonomous vehicles of the level five variety\n\n1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:34.600\n have no first mover advantage.\n\n1:23:34.600 --> 1:23:36.840\n If the technology becomes commoditized,\n\n1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:39.600\n say I wanna go to a new city, look at the scooters.\n\n1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:41.560\n It's gonna look a lot more like scooters.\n\n1:23:41.560 --> 1:23:44.080\n Every person with a checkbook\n\n1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:45.800\n can blanket a city in scooters.\n\n1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:47.960\n And that's why you have 10 different scooter companies.\n\n1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:48.800\n Which one's gonna win?\n\n1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:49.680\n It's a race to the bottom.\n\n1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:51.120\n It's a terrible market to be in\n\n1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:53.240\n because there's no market for scooters.\n\n1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.600\n And the scooters don't get a say\n\n1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:58.240\n in whether they wanna be bought and deployed to a city\n\n1:23:58.240 --> 1:23:59.080\n or not. Right.\n\n1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:00.120\n So the, yeah.\n\n1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:01.360\n We're gonna entice the scooters\n\n1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:03.920\n with subsidies and deals and.\n\n1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:05.920\n So whenever you have to invest that capital,\n\n1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:06.840\n it doesn't.\n\n1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:07.760\n It doesn't come back.\n\n1:24:07.760 --> 1:24:08.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:12.400\n That can't be your main criticism of the Waymo approach.\n\n1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:14.920\n Oh, I'm saying even if it does technically work.\n\n1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:17.120\n Even if it does technically work, that's a problem.\n\n1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:18.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:21.000\n I don't know if I were to say,\n\n1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.600\n I would say you're already there.\n\n1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:24.640\n I haven't even thought about that,\n\n1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:26.600\n but I would say the bigger challenge\n\n1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:28.000\n is the technical approach.\n\n1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.800\n The.\n\n1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:31.880\n So Waymo's cruises.\n\n1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:33.000\n And not just the technical approach,\n\n1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.800\n but of creating value.\n\n1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:39.800\n I still don't understand how you beat Uber,\n\n1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:43.480\n the human driven cars.\n\n1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:44.920\n In terms of financially,\n\n1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:47.160\n it doesn't make sense to me\n\n1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.120\n that people wanna get in an autonomous vehicle.\n\n1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:52.800\n I don't understand how you make money.\n\n1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:54.280\n In the longterm, yes.\n\n1:24:54.280 --> 1:24:56.440\n Like real longterm.\n\n1:24:56.440 --> 1:24:58.600\n But it just feels like there's too much\n\n1:24:58.600 --> 1:24:59.960\n capital investment needed.\n\n1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:01.160\n Oh, and they're gonna be worse than Ubers\n\n1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:04.040\n because they're gonna stop for every little thing,\n\n1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:04.880\n everywhere.\n\n1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:07.280\n I'll say a nice thing about cruise.\n\n1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:08.360\n That was my nice thing about Waymo.\n\n1:25:08.360 --> 1:25:09.200\n They're three years ahead.\n\n1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:10.040\n Wait, what was the nice?\n\n1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:10.880\n Oh, because they're three.\n\n1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:12.400\n They're three years technically ahead of everybody.\n\n1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:13.880\n Their tech stack is great.\n\n1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:17.840\n My nice thing about cruise is GM buying them\n\n1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:19.120\n was a great move for GM.\n\n1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:22.200\n For $1 billion,\n\n1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:25.520\n GM bought an insurance policy against Waymo.\n\n1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:29.960\n They put, cruise is three years behind Waymo.\n\n1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:33.240\n That means Google will get a monopoly on the technology\n\n1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.120\n for at most three years.\n\n1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:38.800\n And if technology works,\n\n1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:40.760\n so you might not even be right about the three years,\n\n1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:41.800\n it might be less.\n\n1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:42.640\n Might be less.\n\n1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:44.240\n Cruise actually might not be that far behind.\n\n1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:47.280\n I don't know how much Waymo has waffled around\n\n1:25:47.280 --> 1:25:49.720\n or how much of it actually is just that long tail.\n\n1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:50.560\n Yeah, okay.\n\n1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:53.520\n If that's the best you could say in terms of nice things,\n\n1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:55.160\n that's more of a nice thing for GM\n\n1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:58.560\n that that's the smart insurance policy.\n\n1:25:58.560 --> 1:25:59.640\n It's a smart insurance policy.\n\n1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:01.840\n I mean, I think that's how,\n\n1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:05.160\n I can't see cruise working out any other.\n\n1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.800\n For cruise to leapfrog Waymo would really surprise me.\n\n1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:12.000\n Yeah, so let's talk about\n\n1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.600\n the underlying assumption of everything is.\n\n1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:15.280\n We're not gonna leapfrog Tesla.\n\n1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:19.440\n Tesla would have to seriously mess up for us\n\n1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:20.400\n because you're.\n\n1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:23.200\n Okay, so the way you leapfrog, right?\n\n1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:26.080\n Is you come up with an idea\n\n1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:28.560\n or you take a direction perhaps secretly\n\n1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:30.640\n that the other people aren't taking.\n\n1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:35.000\n And so the cruise, Waymo,\n\n1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:38.080\n even Aurora.\n\n1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:40.080\n I don't know Aurora, Zooks is the same stack as well.\n\n1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:41.720\n They're all the same code base even.\n\n1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:45.360\n And they're all the same DARPA Urban Challenge code base.\n\n1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:46.800\n So the question is,\n\n1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.960\n do you think there's a room for brilliance and innovation\n\n1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:50.360\n that will change everything?\n\n1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:53.880\n Like say, okay, so I'll give you examples.\n\n1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:58.880\n It could be if revolution and mapping, for example,\n\n1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:03.000\n that allow you to map things,\n\n1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.800\n do HD maps of the whole world,\n\n1:27:05.800 --> 1:27:08.040\n all weather conditions somehow really well,\n\n1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:13.040\n or revolution and simulation\n\n1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:18.040\n to where the all the way you said before becomes incorrect.\n\n1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:21.320\n That kind of thing.\n\n1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:23.200\n Any room for breakthrough innovation?\n\n1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:25.960\n What I said before about,\n\n1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:27.160\n oh, they actually get the whole thing.\n\n1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:30.480\n Well, I'll say this about,\n\n1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:32.640\n we divide driving into three problems\n\n1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:33.800\n and I actually haven't solved the third yet,\n\n1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:34.800\n but I haven't had you how to do it.\n\n1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:36.120\n So there's the static.\n\n1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:38.000\n The static driving problem is assuming\n\n1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.120\n you are the only car on the road, right?\n\n1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:41.960\n And this problem can be solved 100%\n\n1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:43.920\n with mapping and localization.\n\n1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:45.680\n This is why farms work the way they do.\n\n1:27:45.680 --> 1:27:48.360\n If all you have to deal with is the static problem\n\n1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:50.120\n and you can statically schedule your machines, right?\n\n1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:52.640\n It's the same as like statically scheduling processes.\n\n1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:53.960\n You can statically schedule your tractors\n\n1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:56.080\n to never hit each other on their paths, right?\n\n1:27:56.080 --> 1:27:57.440\n Cause they know the speed they go at.\n\n1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:00.080\n So that's the static driving problem.\n\n1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:03.040\n Maps only helps you with the static driving problem.\n\n1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:06.880\n Yeah, the question about static driving,\n\n1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:08.720\n you've just made it sound like it's really easy.\n\n1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:11.880\n Static driving is really easy.\n\n1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:13.040\n How easy?\n\n1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:16.440\n How, well, cause the whole drifting out of lane,\n\n1:28:16.440 --> 1:28:18.720\n when Tesla drifts out of lane,\n\n1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:22.000\n it's failing on the fundamental static driving problem.\n\n1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.440\n Tesla is drifting out of lane?\n\n1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:27.720\n The static driving problem is not easy for the world.\n\n1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:30.360\n The static driving problem is easy for one route.\n\n1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:33.920\n One route and one weather condition\n\n1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:37.920\n with one state of lane markings\n\n1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:40.880\n and like no deterioration, no cracks in the road.\n\n1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:42.600\n No, I'm assuming you have a perfect localizer.\n\n1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:44.200\n So that's solved for the weather condition\n\n1:28:44.200 --> 1:28:45.600\n and the lane marking condition.\n\n1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:46.600\n But that's the problem is,\n\n1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:48.400\n how do you have a perfect localizer?\n\n1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.560\n Perfect localizers are not that hard to build.\n\n1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:53.320\n Okay, come on now, with LIDAR?\n\n1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:54.160\n With LIDAR, yeah.\n\n1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:55.000\n Oh, with LIDAR, okay.\n\n1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:56.400\n With LIDAR, yeah, but you use LIDAR, right?\n\n1:28:56.400 --> 1:28:58.600\n Like use LIDAR, build a perfect localizer.\n\n1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:00.880\n Building a perfect localizer without LIDAR,\n\n1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:04.280\n it's gonna be hard.\n\n1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:05.720\n You can get 10 centimeters without LIDAR,\n\n1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:07.200\n you can get one centimeter with LIDAR.\n\n1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:09.240\n I'm not even concerned about the one or 10 centimeters.\n\n1:29:09.240 --> 1:29:11.160\n I'm concerned if every once in a while,\n\n1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:12.640\n you're just way off.\n\n1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:17.640\n Yeah, so this is why you have to carefully make sure\n\n1:29:17.920 --> 1:29:19.960\n you're always tracking your position.\n\n1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:21.680\n You wanna use LIDAR camera fusion,\n\n1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:24.400\n but you can get the reliability of that system\n\n1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:27.960\n up to 100,000 miles,\n\n1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:29.640\n and then you write some fallback condition\n\n1:29:29.640 --> 1:29:32.120\n where it's not that bad if you're way off, right?\n\n1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:33.720\n I think that you can get it to the point,\n\n1:29:33.720 --> 1:29:36.760\n it's like ASLD that you're never in a case\n\n1:29:36.760 --> 1:29:38.440\n where you're way off and you don't know it.\n\n1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:40.200\n Yeah, okay, so this is brilliant.\n\n1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:42.240\n So that's the static. Static.\n\n1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:45.920\n We can, especially with LIDAR and good HG maps,\n\n1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:47.680\n you can solve that problem. Easy.\n\n1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:50.440\n No, I just disagree with your word easy.\n\n1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.760\n The static problem's so easy.\n\n1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:54.000\n It's very typical for you to say something is easy.\n\n1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:54.840\n I got it. No.\n\n1:29:54.840 --> 1:29:56.880\n It's not as challenging as the other ones, okay.\n\n1:29:56.880 --> 1:29:58.760\n Well, okay, maybe it's obvious how to solve it.\n\n1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:00.320\n The third one's the hardest.\n\n1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:01.880\n And a lot of people don't even think about the third one\n\n1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:03.640\n and even see it as different from the second one.\n\n1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:05.720\n So the second one is dynamic.\n\n1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:08.520\n The second one is like, say there's an obvious example\n\n1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:10.360\n is like a car stopped at a red light, right?\n\n1:30:10.360 --> 1:30:12.520\n You can't have that car in your map\n\n1:30:12.520 --> 1:30:13.720\n because you don't know whether that car\n\n1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:14.880\n is gonna be there or not.\n\n1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:17.960\n So you have to detect that car in real time\n\n1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:20.600\n and then you have to do the appropriate action, right?\n\n1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:24.800\n Also, that car is not a fixed object.\n\n1:30:24.800 --> 1:30:26.600\n That car may move and you have to predict\n\n1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:28.680\n what that car will do, right?\n\n1:30:28.680 --> 1:30:30.840\n So this is the dynamic problem.\n\n1:30:30.840 --> 1:30:31.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:32.800\n So you have to deal with this.\n\n1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:36.640\n This involves, again, like you're gonna need models\n\n1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.000\n of other people's behavior.\n\n1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:40.320\n Are you including in that,\n\n1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:42.320\n I don't wanna step on the third one.\n\n1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:43.160\n Oh.\n\n1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:46.920\n But are you including in that your influence on people?\n\n1:30:46.920 --> 1:30:48.240\n Ah, that's the third one.\n\n1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:49.080\n Okay.\n\n1:30:49.080 --> 1:30:49.920\n That's the third one.\n\n1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:51.840\n We call it the counterfactual.\n\n1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:52.680\n Yeah, brilliant.\n\n1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:53.520\n And that.\n\n1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:54.360\n I just talked to Judea Pearl\n\n1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:55.800\n who's obsessed with counterfactuals.\n\n1:30:55.800 --> 1:30:56.640\n And the counterfactual.\n\n1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:58.600\n Oh yeah, yeah, I read his books.\n\n1:30:58.600 --> 1:31:00.760\n So the static and the dynamic\n\n1:31:00.760 --> 1:31:01.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:04.720\n Our approach right now for lateral\n\n1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:07.560\n will scale completely to the static and dynamic.\n\n1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:10.720\n The counterfactual, the only way I have to do it yet,\n\n1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:13.960\n the thing that I wanna do once we have all of these cars\n\n1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:16.760\n is I wanna do reinforcement learning on the world.\n\n1:31:16.760 --> 1:31:18.880\n I'm always gonna turn the exploiter up to max.\n\n1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:20.440\n I'm not gonna have them explore.\n\n1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:22.760\n But the only real way to get at the counterfactual\n\n1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.080\n is to do reinforcement learning\n\n1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:26.320\n because the other agents are humans.\n\n1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:30.080\n So that's fascinating that you break it down like that.\n\n1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:31.720\n I agree completely.\n\n1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:33.680\n I've spent my life thinking about this problem.\n\n1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:34.520\n It's beautiful.\n\n1:31:34.520 --> 1:31:37.840\n And part of it, because you're slightly insane,\n\n1:31:37.840 --> 1:31:39.080\n it's good.\n\n1:31:39.080 --> 1:31:39.920\n Because.\n\n1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:42.080\n Not my life.\n\n1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:43.120\n Just the last four years.\n\n1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:43.960\n No, no.\n\n1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:48.920\n You have some nonzero percent of your brain\n\n1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:51.520\n has a madman in it, which is good.\n\n1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:52.360\n That's a really good feature.\n\n1:31:52.360 --> 1:31:55.920\n But there's a safety component to it\n\n1:31:55.920 --> 1:31:59.040\n that I think sort of with counterfactuals and so on\n\n1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:00.280\n that would just freak people out.\n\n1:32:00.280 --> 1:32:03.320\n How do you even start to think about just in general?\n\n1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:07.600\n I mean, you've had some friction with NHTSA and so on.\n\n1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:12.600\n I am frankly exhausted by safety engineers.\n\n1:32:14.280 --> 1:32:19.280\n The prioritization on safety over innovation\n\n1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:23.720\n to a degree where it kills, in my view,\n\n1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:26.200\n kills safety in the long term.\n\n1:32:26.200 --> 1:32:28.080\n So the counterfactual thing,\n\n1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:31.560\n they just actually exploring this world\n\n1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:33.880\n of how do you interact with dynamic objects and so on.\n\n1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:34.840\n How do you think about safety?\n\n1:32:34.840 --> 1:32:38.080\n You can do reinforcement learning without ever exploring.\n\n1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:40.400\n And I said that, so you can think about your,\n\n1:32:40.400 --> 1:32:41.520\n in reinforcement learning,\n\n1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:44.280\n it's usually called a temperature parameter.\n\n1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:45.320\n And your temperature parameter\n\n1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:48.080\n is how often you deviate from the argmax.\n\n1:32:48.080 --> 1:32:50.680\n I could always set that to zero and still learn.\n\n1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:52.800\n And I feel that you'd always want that set to zero\n\n1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:54.040\n on your actual system.\n\n1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:54.880\n Gotcha.\n\n1:32:54.880 --> 1:32:58.120\n But the problem is you first don't know very much.\n\n1:32:58.120 --> 1:32:59.520\n And so you're going to make mistakes.\n\n1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:02.360\n So the learning, the exploration happens through mistakes.\n\n1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:03.720\n Yeah, but okay.\n\n1:33:03.720 --> 1:33:06.080\n So the consequences of a mistake.\n\n1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:09.400\n Open pilot and autopilot are making mistakes left and right.\n\n1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:12.560\n We have 700 daily active users,\n\n1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:14.040\n a thousand weekly active users.\n\n1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:18.920\n Open pilot makes tens of thousands of mistakes a week.\n\n1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:21.160\n These mistakes have zero consequences.\n\n1:33:21.160 --> 1:33:22.560\n These mistakes are,\n\n1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:26.840\n oh, I wanted to take this exit and it went straight.\n\n1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:28.520\n So I'm just going to carefully touch the wheel.\n\n1:33:28.520 --> 1:33:29.360\n The humans catch them.\n\n1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:30.680\n The humans catch them.\n\n1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:33.120\n And the human disengagement is labeling\n\n1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:34.160\n that reinforcement learning\n\n1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:36.200\n in a completely consequence free way.\n\n1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.880\n So driver monitoring is the way you ensure they keep.\n\n1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:40.720\n Yes.\n\n1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:42.160\n They keep paying attention.\n\n1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:43.280\n How is your messaging?\n\n1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:45.280\n Say I gave you a billion dollars,\n\n1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:47.840\n you would be scaling it now.\n\n1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:49.760\n Oh, I couldn't scale it with any amount of money.\n\n1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:51.680\n I'd raise money if I could, if I had a way to scale it.\n\n1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:53.360\n Yeah, you're now not focused on scale.\n\n1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:54.200\n I don't know how to do,\n\n1:33:54.200 --> 1:33:55.840\n oh, like I guess I could sell it to more people,\n\n1:33:55.840 --> 1:33:57.040\n but I want to make the system better.\n\n1:33:57.040 --> 1:33:57.880\n Better, better.\n\n1:33:57.880 --> 1:33:58.920\n And I don't know how to, I mean.\n\n1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:01.160\n But what's the messaging here?\n\n1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:06.160\n I got a chance to talk to Elon and he basically said\n\n1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:08.160\n that the human factor doesn't matter.\n\n1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:10.440\n You know, the human doesn't matter\n\n1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:12.360\n because the system will perform,\n\n1:34:12.360 --> 1:34:14.840\n there'll be sort of a, sorry to use the term,\n\n1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:15.680\n but like a singular,\n\n1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:17.880\n like a point where it gets just much better.\n\n1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:20.880\n And so the human, it won't really matter.\n\n1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:25.040\n But it seems like that human catching the system\n\n1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:29.440\n when it gets into trouble is like the thing\n\n1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:32.800\n which will make something like reinforcement learning work.\n\n1:34:32.800 --> 1:34:35.680\n So how do you think messaging for Tesla,\n\n1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:36.880\n for you should change,\n\n1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:39.120\n for the industry in general should change?\n\n1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:40.880\n I think our messaging is pretty clear.\n\n1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:43.120\n At least like our messaging wasn't that clear\n\n1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:45.240\n in the beginning and I do kind of fault myself for that.\n\n1:34:45.240 --> 1:34:48.520\n We are proud right now to be a level two system.\n\n1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:50.400\n We are proud to be level two.\n\n1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:51.680\n If we talk about level four,\n\n1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:53.240\n it's not with the current hardware.\n\n1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:55.960\n It's not gonna be just a magical OTA upgrade.\n\n1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:57.360\n It's gonna be new hardware.\n\n1:34:57.360 --> 1:34:59.600\n It's gonna be very carefully thought out.\n\n1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:01.640\n Right now, we are proud to be level two\n\n1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:03.400\n and we have a rigorous safety model.\n\n1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:06.680\n I mean, not like, okay, rigorous, who knows what that means,\n\n1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:08.720\n but we at least have a safety model\n\n1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:11.920\n and we make it explicit as in safety.md in OpenPilot.\n\n1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:15.960\n And it says, seriously though, safety.md.\n\n1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:18.680\n This is brilliant, this is so Android.\n\n1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:21.880\n Well, this is the safety model\n\n1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:23.960\n and I like to have conversations like,\n\n1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.240\n sometimes people will come to you and they're like,\n\n1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:29.320\n your system's not safe.\n\n1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:31.160\n Okay, have you read my safety docs?\n\n1:35:31.160 --> 1:35:32.760\n Would you like to have an intelligent conversation\n\n1:35:32.760 --> 1:35:33.600\n about this?\n\n1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:34.440\n And the answer is always no.\n\n1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:37.000\n They just like scream about, it runs Python.\n\n1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:39.120\n Okay, what?\n\n1:35:39.120 --> 1:35:41.600\n So you're saying that because Python's not real time,\n\n1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:44.320\n Python not being real time never causes disengagements.\n\n1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:47.720\n Disengagements are caused by, the model is QM.\n\n1:35:47.720 --> 1:35:49.840\n But safety.md says the following,\n\n1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:50.680\n first and foremost,\n\n1:35:50.680 --> 1:35:53.080\n the driver must be paying attention at all times.\n\n1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:57.760\n I still consider the software to be alpha software\n\n1:35:57.760 --> 1:36:00.120\n until we can actually enforce that statement,\n\n1:36:00.120 --> 1:36:03.320\n but I feel it's very well communicated to our users.\n\n1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:04.560\n Two more things.\n\n1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:09.120\n One is the user must be able to easily take control\n\n1:36:09.120 --> 1:36:10.920\n of the vehicle at all times.\n\n1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:14.480\n So if you step on the gas or brake with OpenPilot,\n\n1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:16.440\n it gives full manual control back to the user\n\n1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:17.800\n or press the cancel button.\n\n1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:23.280\n Step two, the car will never react so quickly,\n\n1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:26.000\n we define so quickly to be about one second,\n\n1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.640\n that you can't react in time.\n\n1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:29.480\n And we do this by enforcing torque limits,\n\n1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:31.520\n braking limits and acceleration limits.\n\n1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:36.520\n So we have like our torque limits way lower than Tesla's.\n\n1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:39.080\n This is another potential.\n\n1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:40.240\n If I could tweak Autopilot,\n\n1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:41.320\n I would lower their torque limit\n\n1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:42.960\n and I would add driver monitoring.\n\n1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:46.240\n Because Autopilot can jerk the wheel hard.\n\n1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:47.080\n OpenPilot can't.\n\n1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:52.080\n We limit, and all this code is open source, readable.\n\n1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:54.880\n And I believe now it's all Misra C compliant.\n\n1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:55.720\n What's that mean?\n\n1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:00.400\n Misra is like the automotive coding standard.\n\n1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:03.400\n At first, I've come to respect.\n\n1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:05.000\n I've been reading like the standards lately\n\n1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:05.880\n and I've come to respect them.\n\n1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:07.800\n They're actually written by very smart people.\n\n1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:09.880\n Yeah, they're brilliant people actually.\n\n1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:11.320\n They have a lot of experience.\n\n1:37:11.320 --> 1:37:13.360\n They're sometimes a little too cautious,\n\n1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:16.800\n but in this case, it pays off.\n\n1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:18.440\n Misra is written by like computer scientists.\n\n1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:19.840\n And you can tell by the language they use.\n\n1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:21.120\n You can tell by the language they use,\n\n1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:24.480\n they talk about like whether certain conditions in Misra\n\n1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:26.560\n are decidable or undecidable.\n\n1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:28.360\n And you mean like the halting problem?\n\n1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:31.640\n And yes, all right, you've earned my respect.\n\n1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:33.120\n I will read carefully what you have to say\n\n1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:35.760\n and we wanna make our code compliant with that.\n\n1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:38.160\n All right, so you're proud level two, beautiful.\n\n1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:42.360\n So you were the founder and I think CEO of Kama AI,\n\n1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:44.320\n then you were the head of research.\n\n1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:46.080\n What the heck are you now?\n\n1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:47.440\n What's your connection to Kama AI?\n\n1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:49.400\n I'm the president, but I'm one of those\n\n1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:53.040\n like unelected presidents of like a small dictatorship\n\n1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:55.160\n country, not one of those like elected presidents.\n\n1:37:55.160 --> 1:37:57.160\n Oh, so you're like Putin when he was like the,\n\n1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:58.280\n yeah, I got you.\n\n1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:02.080\n So there's a, what's the governance structure?\n\n1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:04.800\n What's the future of Kama AI?\n\n1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:07.440\n I mean, yeah, it's a business.\n\n1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:10.000\n Do you want, are you just focused on getting things\n\n1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.880\n right now, making some small amount of money in the meantime\n\n1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:17.520\n and then when it works, it works and you scale.\n\n1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.440\n Our burn rate is about 200K a month\n\n1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:23.000\n and our revenue is about 100K a month.\n\n1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.880\n So we need to forex our revenue,\n\n1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:28.160\n but we haven't like tried very hard at that yet.\n\n1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:30.120\n And the revenue is basically selling stuff online.\n\n1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:32.320\n Yeah, we sell stuff shop.kama.ai.\n\n1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:33.880\n Is there other, well, okay,\n\n1:38:33.880 --> 1:38:35.720\n so you'll have to figure out the revenue.\n\n1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:37.840\n That's our only, see, but to me,\n\n1:38:37.840 --> 1:38:40.360\n that's like respectable revenues.\n\n1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:42.640\n We make it by selling products to consumers\n\n1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:45.960\n who are honest and transparent about what they are.\n\n1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:48.920\n Most actually level four companies, right?\n\n1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:54.240\n Cause you could easily start blowing up like smoke,\n\n1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:57.040\n like overselling the hype and feeding into,\n\n1:38:57.040 --> 1:38:59.000\n getting some fundraisers.\n\n1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:00.440\n Oh, you're the guy, you're a genius\n\n1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:01.760\n because you hacked the iPhone.\n\n1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:03.280\n Oh, I hate that, I hate that.\n\n1:39:03.280 --> 1:39:06.640\n Yeah, well, I can trade my social capital for more money.\n\n1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:10.280\n I did it once, I almost regret it doing it the first time.\n\n1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:11.600\n Well, on a small tangent,\n\n1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:16.560\n what's your, you seem to not like fame\n\n1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.880\n and yet you're also drawn to fame.\n\n1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:23.880\n Where are you on that currently?\n\n1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:27.200\n Have you had some introspection, some soul searching?\n\n1:39:27.200 --> 1:39:29.240\n Yeah, I actually,\n\n1:39:29.240 --> 1:39:32.200\n I've come to a pretty stable position on that.\n\n1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:33.880\n Like after the first time,\n\n1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:36.840\n I realized that I don't want attention from the masses.\n\n1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:39.160\n I want attention from people who I respect.\n\n1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:41.960\n Who do you respect?\n\n1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:43.960\n I can give a list of people.\n\n1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:47.200\n So are these like Elon Musk type characters?\n\n1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:50.000\n Yeah, well, actually, you know what?\n\n1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:51.240\n I'll make it more broad than that.\n\n1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:54.040\n I won't make it about a person, I respect skill.\n\n1:39:54.040 --> 1:39:56.840\n I respect people who have skills, right?\n\n1:39:56.840 --> 1:40:01.400\n And I would like to like be, I'm not gonna say famous,\n\n1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:05.440\n but be like known among more people who have like real skills.\n\n1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:11.880\n Who in cars do you think have skill, not do you respect?\n\n1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.760\n Oh, Kyle Vogt has skill.\n\n1:40:17.760 --> 1:40:20.840\n A lot of people at Waymo have skill and I respect them.\n\n1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:23.760\n I respect them as engineers.\n\n1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:24.920\n Like I can think, I mean,\n\n1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:26.280\n I think about all the times in my life\n\n1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:27.960\n where I've been like dead set on approaches\n\n1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:29.760\n and they turn out to be wrong.\n\n1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:31.720\n So, I mean, this might, I might be wrong.\n\n1:40:31.720 --> 1:40:32.600\n I accept that.\n\n1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:36.600\n I accept that there's a decent chance that I'm wrong.\n\n1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:37.440\n And actually, I mean,\n\n1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:39.480\n having talked to Chris Hermsons, Sterling Anderson,\n\n1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:43.360\n those guys, I mean, I deeply respect Chris.\n\n1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:44.640\n I just admire the guy.\n\n1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:47.400\n He's legit.\n\n1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:48.960\n When you drive a car through the desert\n\n1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:52.440\n when everybody thinks it's impossible, that's legit.\n\n1:40:52.440 --> 1:40:53.840\n And then I also really respect the people\n\n1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.680\n who are like writing the infrastructure of the world,\n\n1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:57.760\n like the Linus Torvalds and the Chris Lattiners.\n\n1:40:57.760 --> 1:40:59.080\n They were doing the real work.\n\n1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:00.520\n I know, they're doing the real work.\n\n1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:03.000\n This, having talked to Chris,\n\n1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.600\n like Chris Lattiners, you realize,\n\n1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:05.720\n especially when they're humble,\n\n1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:07.720\n it's like you realize, oh, you guys,\n\n1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:09.680\n we're just using your,\n\n1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:10.520\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:11.560\n All the hard work that you did.\n\n1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.160\n Yeah, that's incredible.\n\n1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:17.200\n What do you think, Mr. Anthony Lewandowski,\n\n1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:21.680\n what do you, he's another mad genius.\n\n1:41:21.680 --> 1:41:22.920\n Sharp guy, oh yeah.\n\n1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:27.680\n What, do you think he might long term become a competitor?\n\n1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:28.880\n Oh, to comma?\n\n1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:32.440\n Well, so I think that he has the other right approach.\n\n1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:35.320\n I think that right now there's two right approaches.\n\n1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:37.720\n One is what we're doing, and one is what he's doing.\n\n1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:39.840\n Can you describe, I think it's called Pronto AI.\n\n1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:40.960\n He started a new thing.\n\n1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:42.400\n Do you know what the approach is?\n\n1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:43.240\n I actually don't know.\n\n1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:45.080\n Embark is also doing the same sort of thing.\n\n1:41:45.080 --> 1:41:47.360\n The idea is almost that you want to,\n\n1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:51.840\n so if you're, I can't partner with Honda and Toyota.\n\n1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:56.840\n Honda and Toyota are like 400,000 person companies.\n\n1:41:56.840 --> 1:41:58.640\n It's not even a company at that point.\n\n1:41:58.640 --> 1:42:00.600\n I don't think of it like, I don't personify it.\n\n1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:01.440\n I think of it like an object,\n\n1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:06.280\n but a trucker drives for a fleet,\n\n1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:09.480\n maybe that has like, some truckers are independent.\n\n1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:11.320\n Some truckers drive for fleets with a hundred trucks.\n\n1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:14.160\n There are tons of independent trucking companies out there.\n\n1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:17.400\n Start a trucking company and drive your costs down\n\n1:42:17.400 --> 1:42:22.400\n or figure out how to drive down the cost of trucking.\n\n1:42:23.040 --> 1:42:25.800\n Another company that I really respect is Nato.\n\n1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:27.800\n Actually, I respect their business model.\n\n1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:30.160\n Nato sells a driver monitoring camera\n\n1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:33.360\n and they sell it to fleet owners.\n\n1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:35.840\n If I owned a fleet of cars\n\n1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:40.840\n and I could pay 40 bucks a month to monitor my employees,\n\n1:42:41.840 --> 1:42:45.040\n this is gonna, it like reduces accidents 18%.\n\n1:42:45.040 --> 1:42:48.400\n It's so like that, in the space,\n\n1:42:48.400 --> 1:42:51.480\n that is like the business model that I like most respect.\n\n1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:54.800\n Cause they're creating value today.\n\n1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:57.880\n Yeah, which is a, that's a huge one.\n\n1:42:57.880 --> 1:42:59.680\n How do we create value today with some of this?\n\n1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:01.720\n And the lane keeping thing is huge.\n\n1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:03.840\n And it sounds like you're creeping in\n\n1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:06.720\n or full steam ahead on the driver monitoring too,\n\n1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:09.280\n which I think actually where the short term value,\n\n1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:10.520\n if you can get it right.\n\n1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.840\n I still, I'm not a huge fan of the statement\n\n1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:15.160\n that everything has to have driver monitoring.\n\n1:43:15.160 --> 1:43:16.160\n I agree with that completely,\n\n1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:18.720\n but that statement usually misses the point\n\n1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:21.960\n that to get the experience of it right is not trivial.\n\n1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:22.880\n Oh no, not at all.\n\n1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:26.200\n In fact, like, so right now we have,\n\n1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:28.560\n I think the timeout depends on speed of the car,\n\n1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:32.520\n but we want to depend on like the scene state.\n\n1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:35.440\n If you're on like an empty highway,\n\n1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:37.720\n it's very different if you don't pay attention\n\n1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:40.600\n than if like you're like coming up to a traffic light.\n\n1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.720\n And longterm, it should probably learn from the driver\n\n1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:48.120\n because that's to do, I watched a lot of video.\n\n1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:49.520\n We've built a smartphone detector\n\n1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:51.600\n just to analyze how people are using smartphones\n\n1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:53.400\n and people are using it very differently.\n\n1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:57.720\n It's a texting styles.\n\n1:43:57.720 --> 1:43:58.560\n There's.\n\n1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:00.280\n We haven't watched nearly enough of the videos.\n\n1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:01.760\n We haven't, I got millions of miles\n\n1:44:01.760 --> 1:44:02.960\n of people driving cars.\n\n1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:05.920\n In this moment, I spent a large fraction of my time\n\n1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:10.840\n just watching videos because it's never fails to learn.\n\n1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:12.280\n Like it never, I've never failed\n\n1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:13.440\n from a video watching session\n\n1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:15.360\n to learn something I didn't know before.\n\n1:44:15.360 --> 1:44:18.440\n In fact, I usually like when I eat lunch,\n\n1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:20.640\n I'll sit, especially when the weather is good\n\n1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:24.560\n and just watch pedestrians with an eye to understand\n\n1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:26.400\n like from a computer vision eye,\n\n1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:29.280\n just to see can this model, can you predict,\n\n1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:30.480\n what are the decisions made?\n\n1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:33.000\n And there's so many things that we don't understand.\n\n1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:34.760\n This is what I mean about the state vector.\n\n1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:37.880\n Yeah, it's, I'm trying to always think like,\n\n1:44:37.880 --> 1:44:40.280\n cause I'm understanding in my human brain,\n\n1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:41.960\n how do we convert that into,\n\n1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.960\n how hard is the learning problem here?\n\n1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:46.960\n I guess is the fundamental question.\n\n1:44:46.960 --> 1:44:51.760\n So something that's from a hacking perspective,\n\n1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:54.160\n this is always comes up, especially with folks.\n\n1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:55.520\n Well, first the most popular question\n\n1:44:55.520 --> 1:44:58.400\n is the trolley problem, right?\n\n1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:01.920\n So that's not a sort of a serious problem.\n\n1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:05.000\n There are some ethical questions I think that arise.\n\n1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:09.600\n Maybe you wanna, do you think there's any ethical,\n\n1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:11.280\n serious ethical questions?\n\n1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:14.040\n We have a solution to the trolley problem at Comm.ai.\n\n1:45:14.040 --> 1:45:16.520\n Well, so there is actually an alert in our code,\n\n1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:18.000\n ethical dilemma detected.\n\n1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:18.960\n It's not triggered yet.\n\n1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:21.040\n We don't know how yet to detect the ethical dilemmas,\n\n1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:22.320\n but we're a level two system.\n\n1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:23.480\n So we're going to disengage\n\n1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:25.280\n and leave that decision to the human.\n\n1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:26.640\n You're such a troll.\n\n1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:28.720\n No, but the trolley problem deserves to be trolled.\n\n1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:32.040\n Yeah, that's a beautiful answer actually.\n\n1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:34.400\n I know, I gave it to someone who was like,\n\n1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:35.360\n sometimes people will ask,\n\n1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:36.560\n like you asked about the trolley problem,\n\n1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:38.040\n like you can have a kind of discussion about it.\n\n1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:40.760\n Like you get someone who's like really like earnest about it\n\n1:45:40.760 --> 1:45:43.560\n because it's the kind of thing where,\n\n1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:45.560\n if you ask a bunch of people in an office,\n\n1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:48.280\n whether we should use a SQL stack or a no SQL stack,\n\n1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:50.560\n if they're not that technical, they have no opinion.\n\n1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:52.360\n But if you ask them what color they want to paint the office,\n\n1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:54.040\n everyone has an opinion on that.\n\n1:45:54.040 --> 1:45:56.040\n And that's why the trolley problem is...\n\n1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:57.240\n I mean, that's a beautiful answer.\n\n1:45:57.240 --> 1:45:59.200\n Yeah, we're able to detect the problem\n\n1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:01.960\n and we're able to pass it on to the human.\n\n1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:03.720\n Wow, I've never heard anyone say it.\n\n1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:06.120\n This is your nice escape route.\n\n1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:07.320\n Okay, but...\n\n1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:08.680\n Proud level two.\n\n1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:09.760\n I'm proud level two.\n\n1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:10.600\n I love it.\n\n1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:14.400\n So the other thing that people have some concern about\n\n1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:17.800\n with AI in general is hacking.\n\n1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:20.120\n So how hard is it, do you think,\n\n1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:21.400\n to hack an autonomous vehicle,\n\n1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:23.800\n either through physical access\n\n1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.680\n or through the more sort of popular now,\n\n1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:28.200\n these adversarial examples on the sensors?\n\n1:46:28.200 --> 1:46:30.720\n Okay, the adversarial examples one.\n\n1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:32.280\n You want to see some adversarial examples\n\n1:46:32.280 --> 1:46:34.880\n that affect humans, right?\n\n1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:38.000\n Oh, well, there used to be a stop sign here,\n\n1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000\n but I put a black bag over the stop sign\n\n1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.520\n and then people ran it, adversarial, right?\n\n1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:47.320\n Like there's tons of human adversarial examples too.\n\n1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:51.480\n The question in general about like security,\n\n1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:53.360\n if you saw something just came out today\n\n1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:55.080\n and like there are always such hypey headlines\n\n1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:57.560\n about like how navigate on autopilot\n\n1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:00.960\n was fooled by a GPS spoof to take an exit.\n\n1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:01.800\n Right.\n\n1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:03.920\n At least that's all they could do was take an exit.\n\n1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:06.360\n If your car is relying on GPS\n\n1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:09.000\n in order to have a safe driving policy,\n\n1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:10.240\n you're doing something wrong.\n\n1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:11.080\n If you're relying,\n\n1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:14.560\n and this is why V2V is such a terrible idea.\n\n1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:19.560\n V2V now relies on both parties getting communication right.\n\n1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:24.760\n This is not even, so I think of safety,\n\n1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:28.440\n security is like a special case of safety, right?\n\n1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:31.840\n Safety is like we put a little, you know,\n\n1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:33.320\n piece of caution tape around the hole\n\n1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:35.520\n so that people won't walk into it by accident.\n\n1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:38.200\n Security is like put a 10 foot fence around the hole\n\n1:47:38.200 --> 1:47:40.100\n so you actually physically cannot climb into it\n\n1:47:40.100 --> 1:47:42.320\n with barbed wire on the top and stuff, right?\n\n1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:45.800\n So like if you're designing systems that are like unreliable,\n\n1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:47.380\n they're definitely not secure.\n\n1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:51.240\n Your car should always do something safe\n\n1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:53.400\n using its local sensors.\n\n1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:55.240\n And then the local sensor should be hardwired.\n\n1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:57.360\n And then could somebody hack into your CAN bus\n\n1:47:57.360 --> 1:47:58.600\n and turn your steering wheel on your brakes?\n\n1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:01.160\n Yes, but they could do it before common AI too, so.\n\n1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:04.640\n Let's think out of the box on some things.\n\n1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:09.360\n So do you think teleoperation has a role in any of this?\n\n1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:13.880\n So remotely stepping in and controlling the cars?\n\n1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:18.880\n No, I think that if the safety operation by design\n\n1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:26.160\n requires a constant link to the cars,\n\n1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:27.600\n I think it doesn't work.\n\n1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:31.120\n So that's the same argument you're using for V2I, V2V?\n\n1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:34.300\n Well, there's a lot of non safety critical stuff\n\n1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:35.140\n you can do with V2I.\n\n1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:37.440\n I like V2I, I like V2I way more than V2V.\n\n1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:39.280\n Because V2I is already like,\n\n1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:40.880\n I already have internet in the car, right?\n\n1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:44.240\n There's a lot of great stuff you can do with V2I.\n\n1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:47.280\n Like for example, you can, well, I already have V2I,\n\n1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:48.880\n Waze is V2I, right?\n\n1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:50.500\n Waze can route me around traffic jams.\n\n1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:52.720\n That's a great example of V2I.\n\n1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:54.420\n And then, okay, the car automatically talks\n\n1:48:54.420 --> 1:48:55.260\n to that same service, like it works.\n\n1:48:55.260 --> 1:48:56.800\n So it's improving the experience,\n\n1:48:56.800 --> 1:48:59.440\n but it's not a fundamental fallback for safety.\n\n1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:04.440\n No, if any of your things that require wireless communication\n\n1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:09.440\n are more than QM, like have an ASL rating, it shouldn't be.\n\n1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:14.160\n You previously said that life is work\n\n1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:17.440\n and that you don't do anything to relax.\n\n1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:20.960\n So how do you think about hard work?\n\n1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:24.680\n What do you think it takes to accomplish great things?\n\n1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:25.820\n And there's a lot of people saying\n\n1:49:25.820 --> 1:49:28.160\n that there needs to be some balance.\n\n1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:31.120\n You need to, in order to accomplish great things,\n\n1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:32.200\n you need to take some time off,\n\n1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:33.920\n you need to reflect and so on.\n\n1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:37.920\n Now, and then some people are just insanely working,\n\n1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:39.680\n burning the candle on both ends.\n\n1:49:39.680 --> 1:49:41.400\n How do you think about that?\n\n1:49:41.400 --> 1:49:43.440\n I think I was trolling in the Siraj interview\n\n1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:44.880\n when I said that.\n\n1:49:44.880 --> 1:49:47.280\n Off camera, right before I smoked a little bit of weed,\n\n1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:49.840\n like, you know, come on, this is a joke, right?\n\n1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:50.880\n Like I do nothing to relax.\n\n1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:52.600\n Look where I am, I'm at a party, right?\n\n1:49:52.600 --> 1:49:55.240\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.\n\n1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:57.200\n So no, no, of course I don't.\n\n1:49:58.080 --> 1:49:59.840\n When I say that life is work though,\n\n1:49:59.840 --> 1:50:04.200\n I mean that like, I think that what gives my life meaning is work.\n\n1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:05.720\n I don't mean that every minute of the day\n\n1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:06.560\n you should be working.\n\n1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:09.800\n I actually think this is not the best way to maximize results.\n\n1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:12.040\n I think that if you're working 12 hours a day,\n\n1:50:12.040 --> 1:50:14.900\n you should be working smarter and not harder.\n\n1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:17.880\n Well, so work gives you meaning.\n\n1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:20.520\n For some people, other sorts of meaning\n\n1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:24.560\n is personal relationships, like family and so on.\n\n1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:27.200\n You've also, in that interview with Siraj,\n\n1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:30.680\n or the trolling, mentioned that one of the things\n\n1:50:30.680 --> 1:50:34.280\n you look forward to in the future is AI girlfriends.\n\n1:50:34.280 --> 1:50:38.720\n So that's a topic that I'm very much fascinated by,\n\n1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:39.760\n not necessarily girlfriends,\n\n1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:41.960\n but just forming a deep connection with AI.\n\n1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:44.320\n What kind of system do you imagine\n\n1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:46.160\n when you say AI girlfriend,\n\n1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:47.720\n whether you were trolling or not?\n\n1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:49.640\n No, that one I'm very serious about.\n\n1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:52.280\n And I'm serious about that on both a shallow level\n\n1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:53.600\n and a deep level.\n\n1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:55.600\n I think that VR brothels are coming soon\n\n1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:57.760\n and are going to be really cool.\n\n1:50:57.760 --> 1:50:59.680\n It's not cheating if it's a robot.\n\n1:50:59.680 --> 1:51:01.000\n I see the slogan already.\n\n1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:06.160\n But there's, I don't know if you've watched,\n\n1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:08.320\n or just watched the Black Mirror episode.\n\n1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:09.320\n I watched the latest one, yeah.\n\n1:51:09.320 --> 1:51:10.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:12.840\n Oh, the Ashley 2 one?\n\n1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:16.920\n No, where there's two friends\n\n1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:20.160\n who are having sex with each other in...\n\n1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:21.000\n Oh, in the VR game.\n\n1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:22.720\n In the VR game.\n\n1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:23.560\n It's just two guys,\n\n1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:27.200\n but one of them was a female, yeah.\n\n1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:29.520\n Which is another mind blowing concept.\n\n1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:33.240\n That in VR, you don't have to be the form.\n\n1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:37.160\n You can be two animals having sex.\n\n1:51:37.160 --> 1:51:38.000\n It's weird.\n\n1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:38.920\n I mean, I'll see how nice that the software\n\n1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:40.240\n maps the nerve endings, right?\n\n1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:41.600\n Yeah, it's huge.\n\n1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:44.440\n I mean, yeah, they sweep a lot of the fascinating,\n\n1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:46.400\n really difficult technical challenges under the rug,\n\n1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:48.320\n like assuming it's possible\n\n1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:51.120\n to do the mapping of the nerve endings, then...\n\n1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:51.960\n I wish, yeah, I saw that,\n\n1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:53.800\n the way they did it with the little like stim unit\n\n1:51:53.800 --> 1:51:55.400\n on the head, that'd be amazing.\n\n1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:58.760\n So, well, no, no, on a shallow level,\n\n1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:01.680\n like you could set up like almost a brothel\n\n1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:05.160\n with like real dolls and Oculus Quests,\n\n1:52:05.160 --> 1:52:06.200\n write some good software.\n\n1:52:06.200 --> 1:52:08.360\n I think it'd be a cool novelty experience.\n\n1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:11.400\n But no, on a deeper, like emotional level,\n\n1:52:12.840 --> 1:52:17.000\n I mean, yeah, I would really like to fall in love\n\n1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:18.120\n with a machine.\n\n1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:23.120\n Do you see yourself having a long term relationship\n\n1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.600\n of the kind monogamous relationship that we have now\n\n1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:31.360\n with a robot, with a AI system even,\n\n1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:32.680\n not even just a robot?\n\n1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:37.680\n So I think about maybe my ideal future.\n\n1:52:38.120 --> 1:52:43.120\n When I was 15, I read Eliezer Yudkowsky's early writings\n\n1:52:43.120 --> 1:52:48.120\n on the singularity and like that AI\n\n1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:52.480\n is going to surpass human intelligence massively.\n\n1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:55.440\n He made some Moore's law based predictions\n\n1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:57.360\n that I mostly agree with.\n\n1:52:57.360 --> 1:52:59.320\n And then I really struggled\n\n1:52:59.320 --> 1:53:01.320\n for the next couple of years of my life.\n\n1:53:01.320 --> 1:53:03.320\n Like, why should I even bother to learn anything?\n\n1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:06.080\n It's all gonna be meaningless when the machines show up.\n\n1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:06.920\n Right.\n\n1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:10.480\n Maybe when I was that young,\n\n1:53:10.480 --> 1:53:11.960\n I was still a little bit more pure\n\n1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:13.120\n and really like clung to that.\n\n1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:13.960\n And then I'm like, well,\n\n1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:14.960\n the machines ain't here yet, you know,\n\n1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:16.720\n and I seem to be pretty good at this stuff.\n\n1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:18.440\n Let's try my best, you know,\n\n1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:20.240\n like what's the worst that happens.\n\n1:53:21.320 --> 1:53:24.000\n But the best possible future I see\n\n1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.760\n is me sort of merging with the machine.\n\n1:53:26.760 --> 1:53:28.760\n And the way that I personify this\n\n1:53:28.760 --> 1:53:31.560\n is in a long term monogamous relationship with a machine.\n\n1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:34.040\n Oh, you don't think there's a room\n\n1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:35.680\n for another human in your life,\n\n1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:38.080\n if you really truly merge with another machine?\n\n1:53:39.160 --> 1:53:40.840\n I mean, I see merging.\n\n1:53:40.840 --> 1:53:45.000\n I see like the best interface to my brain\n\n1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:48.680\n is like the same relationship interface\n\n1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:49.920\n to merge with an AI, right?\n\n1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:51.520\n What does that merging feel like?\n\n1:53:52.840 --> 1:53:55.920\n I've seen couples who've been together for a long time.\n\n1:53:55.920 --> 1:53:58.400\n And like, I almost think of them as one person,\n\n1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:01.840\n like couples who spend all their time together and...\n\n1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:02.680\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:03.840\n You're actually putting,\n\n1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:06.040\n what does that merging actually looks like?\n\n1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:08.120\n It's not just a nice channel.\n\n1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:12.160\n Like a lot of people imagine it's just an efficient link,\n\n1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:14.280\n search link to Wikipedia or something.\n\n1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:15.200\n I don't believe in that.\n\n1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:16.040\n But it's more,\n\n1:54:16.040 --> 1:54:18.520\n you're saying that there's the same kind of relationship\n\n1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:19.400\n you have with another human,\n\n1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:20.760\n that's a deep relationship.\n\n1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:22.880\n That's what merging looks like.\n\n1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:24.400\n That's pretty...\n\n1:54:24.400 --> 1:54:26.600\n I don't believe that link is possible.\n\n1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:27.680\n I think that that link,\n\n1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:29.160\n so you're like, oh, I'm gonna download Wikipedia\n\n1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:30.080\n right to my brain.\n\n1:54:30.080 --> 1:54:33.280\n My reading speed is not limited by my eyes.\n\n1:54:33.280 --> 1:54:36.720\n My reading speed is limited by my inner processing loop.\n\n1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:40.680\n And to like bootstrap that sounds kind of unclear\n\n1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:42.360\n how to do it and horrifying.\n\n1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:46.480\n But if I am with somebody and I'll use a somebody\n\n1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:51.280\n who is making a super sophisticated model of me\n\n1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:53.120\n and then running simulations on that model,\n\n1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:54.040\n I'm not gonna get into the question\n\n1:54:54.040 --> 1:54:55.840\n whether the simulations are conscious or not.\n\n1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:58.200\n I don't really wanna know what it's doing.\n\n1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:00.080\n But using those simulations\n\n1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:01.840\n to play out hypothetical futures for me,\n\n1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:04.840\n deciding what things to say to me,\n\n1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:06.240\n to guide me along a path.\n\n1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:08.680\n And that's how I envision it.\n\n1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:13.680\n So on that path to AI of superhuman level intelligence,\n\n1:55:15.080 --> 1:55:16.840\n you've mentioned that you believe in the singularity,\n\n1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:18.600\n that singularity is coming.\n\n1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:20.200\n Again, could be trolling, could be not,\n\n1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:23.000\n could be part, all trolling has truth in it.\n\n1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.120\n I don't know what that means anymore.\n\n1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:25.920\n What is the singularity?\n\n1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:28.040\n Yeah, so that's really the question.\n\n1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:30.520\n How many years do you think before the singularity,\n\n1:55:30.520 --> 1:55:32.080\n what form do you think it will take?\n\n1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:35.440\n Does that mean fundamental shifts in capabilities of AI?\n\n1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:38.000\n Or does it mean some other kind of ideas?\n\n1:55:39.400 --> 1:55:41.360\n Maybe that's just my roots, but.\n\n1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.880\n So I can buy a human beings worth of compute\n\n1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:46.000\n for like a million bucks today.\n\n1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:47.680\n It's about one TPU pod V3.\n\n1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:50.120\n I want like, I think they claim a hundred pay to flops.\n\n1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:50.960\n That's being generous.\n\n1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:52.240\n I think humans are actually more like 20.\n\n1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:53.080\n So that's like five humans.\n\n1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:53.960\n That's pretty good.\n\n1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:55.560\n Google needs to sell their TPUs.\n\n1:55:56.720 --> 1:55:58.560\n But I could buy, I could buy, I could buy GPUs.\n\n1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:02.200\n I could buy a stack of like, I'd buy 1080 TIs,\n\n1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:03.760\n build data center full of them.\n\n1:56:03.760 --> 1:56:08.040\n And for a million bucks, I can get a human worth of compute.\n\n1:56:08.040 --> 1:56:12.160\n But when you look at the total number of flops in the world,\n\n1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:14.400\n when you look at human flops,\n\n1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:17.040\n which goes up very, very slowly with the population\n\n1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:19.760\n and machine flops, which goes up exponentially,\n\n1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:22.360\n but it's still nowhere near.\n\n1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:24.560\n I think that's the key thing to talk about\n\n1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:25.880\n when the singularity happened.\n\n1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:29.760\n When most flops in the world are Silicon and not biological,\n\n1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:32.280\n that's kind of the crossing point.\n\n1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:35.480\n Like they're now the dominant species on the planet.\n\n1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:38.720\n And just looking at how technology is progressing,\n\n1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:40.360\n when do you think that could possibly happen?\n\n1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:41.680\n You think it would happen in your lifetime?\n\n1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:43.600\n Oh yeah, definitely in my lifetime.\n\n1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:44.440\n I've done the math.\n\n1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:47.520\n I like 2038 because it's the Unix timestamp rollover.\n\n1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:52.640\n Yeah, beautifully put.\n\n1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:57.640\n So you've said that the meaning of life is to win.\n\n1:56:57.960 --> 1:56:59.520\n If you look five years into the future,\n\n1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:02.640\n what does winning look like?\n\n1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:03.680\n So,\n\n1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:10.120\n there's a lot of,\n\n1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:12.680\n I can go into like technical depth\n\n1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:14.640\n to what I mean by that, to win.\n\n1:57:15.760 --> 1:57:18.280\n It may not mean, I was criticized for that in the comments.\n\n1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:20.520\n Like, doesn't this guy wanna like save the penguins\n\n1:57:20.520 --> 1:57:22.520\n in Antarctica or like,\n\n1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:24.920\n oh man, listen to what I'm saying.\n\n1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:27.560\n I'm not talking about like I have a yacht or something.\n\n1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:30.520\n But I am an agent.\n\n1:57:30.520 --> 1:57:31.880\n I am put into this world.\n\n1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:36.320\n And I don't really know what my purpose is.\n\n1:57:37.480 --> 1:57:40.280\n But if you're an intelligent agent\n\n1:57:40.280 --> 1:57:41.400\n and you're put into a world,\n\n1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:43.160\n what is the ideal thing to do?\n\n1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:44.800\n Well, the ideal thing mathematically,\n\n1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:47.080\n you can go back to like Schmidt Hoover theories about this,\n\n1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:50.480\n is to build a compressive model of the world.\n\n1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:51.840\n To build a maximally compressive,\n\n1:57:51.840 --> 1:57:55.600\n to explore the world such that your exploration function\n\n1:57:55.600 --> 1:57:58.880\n maximizes the derivative of compression of the past.\n\n1:57:58.880 --> 1:58:00.720\n Schmidt Hoover has a paper about this.\n\n1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:02.040\n And like, I took that kind of\n\n1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:03.800\n as like a personal goal function.\n\n1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:07.720\n So what I mean to win, I mean like,\n\n1:58:07.720 --> 1:58:09.080\n maybe this is religious,\n\n1:58:09.080 --> 1:58:11.320\n but like I think that in the future,\n\n1:58:11.320 --> 1:58:13.040\n I might be given a real purpose\n\n1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:14.680\n or I may decide this purpose myself.\n\n1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:16.160\n And then at that point,\n\n1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:18.240\n now I know what the game is and I know how to win.\n\n1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:19.080\n I think right now,\n\n1:58:19.080 --> 1:58:20.720\n I'm still just trying to figure out what the game is.\n\n1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:21.800\n But once I know,\n\n1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:26.440\n so you have imperfect information,\n\n1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:28.600\n you have a lot of uncertainty about the reward function\n\n1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:29.720\n and you're discovering it.\n\n1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:30.560\n Exactly.\n\n1:58:30.560 --> 1:58:31.400\n But the purpose is...\n\n1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:33.120\n That's a better way to put it.\n\n1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:34.440\n The purpose is to maximize it\n\n1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:37.960\n while you have a lot of uncertainty around it.\n\n1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:39.400\n And you're both reducing the uncertainty\n\n1:58:39.400 --> 1:58:41.160\n and maximizing at the same time.\n\n1:58:41.160 --> 1:58:42.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.240\n And so that's at the technical level.\n\n1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:47.440\n What is the, if you believe in the universal prior,\n\n1:58:47.440 --> 1:58:49.360\n what is the universal reward function?\n\n1:58:49.360 --> 1:58:51.320\n That's the better way to put it.\n\n1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:53.680\n So that win is interesting.\n\n1:58:53.680 --> 1:58:57.280\n I think I speak for everyone in saying that\n\n1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:01.920\n I wonder what that reward function is for you.\n\n1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:05.920\n And I look forward to seeing that in five years,\n\n1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:07.040\n in 10 years.\n\n1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:08.680\n I think a lot of people, including myself,\n\n1:59:08.680 --> 1:59:09.840\n are cheering you on, man.\n\n1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:14.280\n So I'm happy you exist and I wish you the best of luck.\n\n1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:15.360\n Thanks for talking to me, man.\n\n1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:16.200\n Thank you.\n\n1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:21.200\n Have a good one.\n\n"
