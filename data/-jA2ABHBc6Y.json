  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:06.320\n The following is a conversation with Sarah Seager, a planetary scientist at MIT known\n\n00:06.320 --> 00:12.120\n for her work on the search for exoplanets, which are planets outside of our solar system.\n\n00:12.120 --> 00:18.440\n She's an author of two books on this fascinating topic, plus in a couple days, August 18th,\n\n00:18.440 --> 00:23.680\n her new book, a memoir called The Smallest Lights in the Universe, is coming out.\n\n00:23.680 --> 00:29.720\n I read it and I can recommend it highly, especially if you love space and are a bit of a romantic\n\n00:29.720 --> 00:30.720\n like me.\n\n00:30.720 --> 00:32.400\n It's beautifully written.\n\n00:32.400 --> 00:36.860\n She weaves the stories of the tragedies and the triumphs of her life with the stories\n\n00:36.860 --> 00:43.440\n of her love for and research on exoplanets, which represent our hope to find life out\n\n00:43.440 --> 00:45.440\n there in the universe.\n\n00:45.440 --> 00:46.760\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n00:46.760 --> 00:52.640\n Three sponsors, Public Goods, that's a new one, PowerDot, and Cash App.\n\n00:52.640 --> 00:55.080\n Click the links in the description to get a discount.\n\n00:55.080 --> 00:58.920\n It really is the best way to support this podcast.\n\n00:58.920 --> 00:59.920\n Just a quick side note.\n\n00:59.920 --> 01:06.640\n Let me say that extraterrestrial life, aliens, I think represent our civilization longing\n\n01:06.640 --> 01:12.320\n to make contact with the unknown, with others like us, or maybe others that are very different\n\n01:12.320 --> 01:18.860\n from us, entities that might reveal something profound about why we're here.\n\n01:18.860 --> 01:25.080\n The possibility of this is both exciting and, at least to me, terrifying, which is exactly\n\n01:25.080 --> 01:28.480\n where we humans do our best work.\n\n01:28.480 --> 01:33.200\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 stars on Apple Podcast, support\n\n01:33.200 --> 01:37.360\n on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n01:37.360 --> 01:41.000\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now, and never any ads in the middle that could\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:43.040\n break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:43.040 --> 01:47.400\n I try to make these ad reads interesting if you do listen, but if you like, I give you\n\n01:47.400 --> 01:53.080\n timestamps so you can skip to the conversation, but still, please do check out the sponsors\n\n01:53.080 --> 01:55.800\n by clicking the special links in the description.\n\n01:55.800 --> 01:58.800\n That's the best way to support this podcast.\n\n01:58.800 --> 02:04.800\n This show is sponsored by Public Goods, the one stop shop for affordable, sustainable,\n\n02:04.800 --> 02:06.840\n healthy household products.\n\n02:06.840 --> 02:11.160\n Their products have a minimalist black and white design that I find to be just clean,\n\n02:11.160 --> 02:13.160\n elegant, and beautiful.\n\n02:13.160 --> 02:16.360\n It's a style that makes me feel like I'm living in the future.\n\n02:16.360 --> 02:21.440\n I imagine we'll all be using Public Goods products once we colonize Mars.\n\n02:21.440 --> 02:27.300\n They got all the basics you need from healthy snacks like almonds to my favorite, the bamboo\n\n02:27.300 --> 02:33.520\n toothbrush, and other stuff for personal care, home essentials, healthy food, and vitamins\n\n02:33.520 --> 02:34.520\n and supplements.\n\n02:34.520 --> 02:39.060\n I take their fish oil, for example, which I recommend highly for everyone.\n\n02:39.060 --> 02:44.800\n They use a membership model to keep costs low and pass on the savings to us, the people.\n\n02:44.800 --> 02:50.920\n They plant one tree for every order placed and have planted over 100,000 trees since\n\n02:50.920 --> 02:53.160\n September 2019.\n\n02:53.160 --> 02:58.920\n Visit publicgoods.com slash lex or use

that I've been using a lot for muscle recovery,\n\n03:15.960 --> 03:20.880\n mostly for my shoulders and legs as I've been doing the crazy amounts of body weight reps\n\n03:20.880 --> 03:24.200\n and 6 miles every other day now after the challenge.\n\n03:24.200 --> 03:26.540\n Yes, I'm still doing it.\n\n03:26.540 --> 03:31.980\n They call it the smart muscle stimulator since the app that goes with it is amazing.\n\n03:31.980 --> 03:35.360\n It has 15 programs for different body parts and guides you through everything you need\n\n03:35.360 --> 03:36.360\n to do.\n\n03:36.360 --> 03:41.380\n I take recovery really seriously these days and Power Dot has been a powerful addition\n\n03:41.380 --> 03:45.960\n to stretching, ice, massage, and sleep and diet.\n\n03:45.960 --> 03:51.120\n It's used by professional athletes and by slightly insane, but mostly normal people\n\n03:51.120 --> 03:52.280\n like me.\n\n03:52.280 --> 03:55.560\n It's portable so you can throw it in a bag and bring

support this podcast.\n\n04:07.480 --> 04:14.400\n This show is presented by a sponsor that arguably made this whole podcast even possible.\n\n04:14.400 --> 04:19.200\n Our first sponsor, the great, the powerful Cash App, the number one finance app in the\n\n04:19.200 --> 04:20.200\n App Store.\n\n04:20.200 --> 04:24.600\n I will forever be grateful to them for sponsoring this podcast.\n\n04:24.600 --> 04:27.800\n They're awesome people, awesome company, awesome product.\n\n04:27.800 --> 04:29.360\n Okay, back to the read.\n\n04:29.360 --> 04:32.560\n When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.\n\n04:32.560 --> 04:36.520\n Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with\n\n04:36.520 --> 04:38.580\n as little as one dollar.\n\n04:38.580 --> 04:42.880\n Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the\n\n04:42.880 --> 04:45.360\n context of the history of money is fascinating.\n\n04:45.360 --> 04:48.840\n I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.\n\n04:48.840 --> 04:53.560\n Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago.\n\n04:53.560 --> 04:54.560\n Time flies.\n\n04:54.560 --> 04:59.560\n The US dollar created over 200 years ago and the first decentralized cryptocurrency released\n\n04:59.560 --> 05:01.560\n just over 10 years ago.\n\n05:01.560 --> 05:06.680\n So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development,\n\n05:06.680 --> 05:11.920\n but it's still aiming to and just might redefine the nature of money.\n\n05:11.920 --> 05:17.200\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LEX PODCAST,\n\n05:17.200 --> 05:22.640\n you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, an organization that is helping\n\n05:22.640 --> 05:27.520\n to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n05:27.520 --> 05:32.360\n And now here's my conversation with Sarah Seeger.\n\n05:32.360 --> 05:34.940\n When did you first fall in love with the stars?\n\n05:34.940 --> 05:37.240\n I think I've always loved the stars.\n\n05:37.240 --> 05:39.320\n One of my first memory is of the moon.\n\n05:39.320 --> 05:44.000\n I remember watching the moon and I was in the car with my dad who my parents were divorced\n\n05:44.000 --> 05:47.920\n and he was driving me and my siblings to his house for the weekend and the moon was just\n\n05:47.920 --> 05:49.200\n following me.\n\n05:49.200 --> 05:51.400\n Just had no idea why that was.\n\n05:51.400 --> 05:55.340\n So like looking up at the sky and there's this glowing thing, how do you make sense\n\n05:55.340 --> 05:57.840\n of the moon at that age?\n\n05:57.840 --> 05:58.840\n Like age five.\n\n05:58.840 --> 05:59.840\n There's just no way you can.\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:03.640\n I think it's one of the great things about being a kid is just that curiosity that all\n\n06:03.640 --> 06:04.640\n kids have.\n\n06:04.640 --> 06:11.160\n You know, I was thinking because there's these almost out there ideas of that our earth is\n\n06:11.160 --> 06:14.440\n flat, floating about on the internet.\n\n06:14.440 --> 06:21.120\n And it made me think, you know, when did I first realize that the earth is like this\n\n06:21.120 --> 06:25.780\n ball that's flying through empty space?\n\n06:25.780 --> 06:27.520\n I mean, it's terrifying.\n\n06:27.520 --> 06:28.520\n It's awe inspiring.\n\n06:28.520 --> 06:31.280\n I don't know how to make sense of it.\n\n06:31.280 --> 06:34.840\n It's hard because we live in our frame of reference here on this planet.\n\n06:34.840 --> 06:35.840\n It's nearly impossible.\n\n06:35.840 --> 06:38.240\n None of us are lucky to go to see the curvature of earth.\n\n06:38.240 --> 06:43.360\n I mean, do you remember when you realized, understood like the physics, like the layout\n\n06:43.360 --> 06:45.880\n of the solar system?\n\n06:45.880 --> 06:51.120\n Was it like, did you first have to take physics to really, like high school physics to really\n\n06:51.120 --> 06:52.420\n take that in?\n\n06:52.420 --> 06:53.480\n I think it's hard to say.\n\n06:53.480 --> 06:55.220\n I had this book when I was a child.\n\n06:55.220 --> 06:56.220\n It was in French.\n\n06:56.220 --> 07:01.800\n I grew up in Canada, where French is supposedly taught to all of us English speaking Canadians.\n\n07:01.800 --> 07:05.240\n And it was this book in French was about the solar system, and I just love flipping through\n\n07:05.240 --> 07:06.240\n it.\n\n07:06.240 --> 07:10.120\n It's hard to say how much, you know, you or I understand when we're kids, but it was\n\n07:10.120 --> 07:11.560\n really great book.\n\n07:11.560 --> 07:12.560\n What about the stars?\n\n07:12.560 --> 07:14.920\n When did you first learn about the stars?\n\n07:14.920 --> 07:17.880\n Like I do have this very incredible distinctive memory.\n\n07:17.880 --> 07:19.120\n And again, it had to do with my dad.\n\n07:19.120 --> 07:20.120\n He took us camping.\n\n07:20.120 --> 07:26.040\n Now, my dad was from the UK, and he was the type who you'd find wearing a tie on weekends.\n\n07:26.040 --> 07:29.280\n So camping was not in his sphere, his comfort zone.\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:31.680\n We had a babysitter.\n\n07:31.680 --> 07:34.600\n Every summer we had a babysitter, and one summer we had Tom.\n\n07:34.600 --> 07:36.400\n He was barely older than we were.\n\n07:36.400 --> 07:37.400\n He was 14.\n\n07:37.400 --> 07:38.400\n My brother was 12.\n\n07:38.400 --> 07:40.480\n I would have been 11 or 10 maybe.\n\n07:40.480 --> 07:42.920\n And we went camping because Tom said camping is the thing.\n\n07:42.920 --> 07:43.920\n We should try it.\n\n07:43.920 --> 07:48.200\n And I just remember I didn't aim to see the stars, but I walked out of my tent in the\n\n07:48.200 --> 07:55.360\n middle of the night, and I looked up, and wow, so many stars.\n\n07:55.360 --> 07:59.000\n The dark night sky and all those stars just screaming at me.\n\n07:59.000 --> 08:00.560\n I just couldn't believe that.\n\n08:00.560 --> 08:04.820\n Honestly, my first thought was, this is so incredible, mind blowing.\n\n08:04.820 --> 08:07.320\n Why wouldn't anyone have told me this existed?\n\n08:07.320 --> 08:08.880\n Can anyone else see this?\n\n08:08.880 --> 08:12.680\n Have you had an experience like that with anything?\n\n08:12.680 --> 08:13.680\n Yeah.\n\n08:13.680 --> 08:14.680\n I've had that.\n\n08:14.680 --> 08:17.560\n I mean, I don't know if maybe you can tell me if it's the same.\n\n08:17.560 --> 08:20.000\n I've had that with robots.\n\n08:20.000 --> 08:23.240\n There's a few robots I've met where I just fell in love with this.\n\n08:23.240 --> 08:25.160\n Is anyone else seeing this?\n\n08:25.160 --> 08:34.720\n Is anyone else seeing that here in a robot is our ability to engineer some intelligent\n\n08:34.720 --> 08:39.960\n beings, intelligent beings that we could love, that could love us, that we can interact with\n\n08:39.960 --> 08:44.440\n in some rich ways that we haven't yet discovered?\n\n08:44.440 --> 08:49.540\n Almost like when you get a puppy, instead of a dog, and there's this immediate bond\n\n08:49.540 --> 08:58.800\n and love, and on top of that, ability to engineer it, I had to just pause and hold myself.\n\n08:58.800 --> 09:03.160\n I imagine, I don't have kids, I imagine there's a magic to that as well, where it's a totally\n\n09:03.160 --> 09:04.160\n new experience.\n\n09:04.160 --> 09:05.160\n It's like, what?\n\n09:05.160 --> 09:13.520\n Well, yeah, the stars though, unlike kids or the puppy, it's only a good thing.\n\n09:13.520 --> 09:15.960\n So you felt, you weren't terrified?\n\n09:15.960 --> 09:23.420\n Like to me, when I look at the stars, it's almost paralyzingly scary how little we know\n\n09:23.420 --> 09:26.200\n about the universe, how alone we are.\n\n09:26.200 --> 09:28.120\n I mean, somehow it feels alone.\n\n09:28.120 --> 09:34.800\n I'm not sure if it's just a matter of perspective, but it feels like, wow, there's billions\n\n09:34.800 --> 09:39.360\n of them out there and we know nothing about them.\n\n09:39.360 --> 09:42.680\n And then also immediately to me, somehow mortality comes into it.\n\n09:42.680 --> 09:45.200\n I mean, how did that make you feel at that time?\n\n09:45.200 --> 09:48.880\n I think as a child without articulating it, I felt that same way.\n\n09:48.880 --> 09:50.600\n Just like, wow, this is terrifying.\n\n09:50.600 --> 09:51.600\n What's out there?\n\n09:51.600 --> 09:52.600\n Like, what is this?\n\n09:52.600 --> 09:55.720\n What does it mean about us here?\n\n09:55.720 --> 10:02.200\n You're a scientist, an exo world class scientist, planetary scientist, astronomer.\n\n10:02.200 --> 10:06.960\n Now I'm a bit of an idiot who likes to ask silly questions.\n\n10:06.960 --> 10:12.400\n So some questions are a little bit in the realm of speculation, almost philosophical\n\n10:12.400 --> 10:17.240\n because we know so little and one of the awesome things about your work is you've actually\n\n10:17.240 --> 10:20.840\n put data and real science behind some of the biggest questions that we're all curious\n\n10:20.840 --> 10:21.840\n about.\n\n10:21.840 --> 10:25.640\n But nevertheless, many of the questions might be a little bit speculative.\n\n10:25.640 --> 10:33.120\n So on that topic, just in your sense, do you think we're alone in the universe, human\n\n10:33.120 --> 10:34.120\n beings?\n\n10:34.120 --> 10:36.280\n Do you think there's life out there?\n\n10:36.280 --> 10:40.520\n Well, Lex, the funny thing is, is that as a scientist, I so don't even want to answer\n\n10:40.520 --> 10:41.520\n that.\n\n10:41.520 --> 10:46.160\n I will answer it though, but I just love to say, yeah, we naturally resist that because\n\n10:46.160 --> 10:49.800\n we want numbers and hard facts and not speculation.\n\n10:49.800 --> 10:51.200\n But I do love that question.\n\n10:51.200 --> 10:55.100\n It's a great question and it's one we all wonder about, but I have to give you the scientist\n\n10:55.100 --> 11:01.280\n answer first, which is we'll have the capability to answer that question soon, even starting\n\n11:01.280 --> 11:02.280\n soon.\n\n11:02.280 --> 11:03.840\n How do you define soon?\n\n11:03.840 --> 11:05.200\n How do I define soon?\n\n11:05.200 --> 11:07.000\n So much happened in the last hundred years.\n\n11:07.000 --> 11:08.000\n Right, right.\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:11.800\n And there's a difference, right, if it's 10 years or 20 years or a hundred years.\n\n11:11.800 --> 11:14.000\n Yeah, there's a difference in that.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:18.920\n Well, soon could be a decade or two decades.\n\n11:18.920 --> 11:23.200\n Journalists usually don't like that or the people want like tomorrow, they want the news.\n\n11:23.200 --> 11:28.680\n But what it's going to take is telescopes, space telescopes, or very sophisticated ground\n\n11:28.680 --> 11:35.160\n or space telescopes to let us study the atmospheres of other planets far away and to look what's\n\n11:35.160 --> 11:38.640\n in the atmospheres and to look for water, which is needed for life as we know it, to\n\n11:38.640 --> 11:42.080\n look for gases that don't belong that we might attribute to life.\n\n11:42.080 --> 11:45.680\n So we have to do some really nitty gritty astronomy.\n\n11:45.680 --> 11:51.480\n So the promising way to answer this question scientifically is to look for hints of life.\n\n11:51.480 --> 11:55.960\n That's where like many of your ideas come in of what kind of hints might we actually\n\n11:55.960 --> 11:57.200\n see about this life.\n\n11:57.200 --> 11:58.200\n Right, right.\n\n11:58.200 --> 11:59.200\n That's exactly what we need to do.\n\n11:59.200 --> 12:02.600\n And I like the word you chose, hint, because it's going to be a hint.\n\n12:02.600 --> 12:05.600\n It's not going to be a 100% yay, we found it.\n\n12:05.600 --> 12:12.200\n And then it will take future generations to do more careful work to hopefully even find\n\n12:12.200 --> 12:17.640\n a way to send a probe to these distant exoplanets and to really figure this out for us.\n\n12:17.640 --> 12:19.320\n I mean, we'll talk about the details.\n\n12:19.320 --> 12:26.480\n Those are fun, but like the back to the speculation, the zoomed out big picture is, yes, I believe\n\n12:26.480 --> 12:30.020\n absolutely there is life out there somewhere.\n\n12:30.020 --> 12:33.760\n Because the vastness of the universe is incredible.\n\n12:33.760 --> 12:35.780\n It's so breathtaking.\n\n12:35.780 --> 12:40.040\n When we look at the night sky, if you can go to that dark sky, you can see many, many\n\n12:40.040 --> 12:43.480\n hundred or even if you have good eyesight and you're somewhere very dark, you could\n\n12:43.480 --> 12:44.880\n see thousands of stars.\n\n12:44.880 --> 12:51.240\n But in our galaxy, we have hundreds of billions of stars and our universe has hundreds of\n\n12:51.240 --> 12:53.820\n billions of galaxies.\n\n12:53.820 --> 12:57.760\n So think about all those stars out there.\n\n12:57.760 --> 13:02.120\n And even if planets are rare, even if life is rare, just because the number of stars\n\n13:02.120 --> 13:06.800\n is so huge, things have to come together somewhere, someplace in our universe.\n\n13:06.800 --> 13:07.800\n Yeah.\n\n13:07.800 --> 13:14.120\n So amazing to think that somebody might be looking up on another planet in a distant\n\n13:14.120 --> 13:15.120\n galaxy.\n\n13:15.120 --> 13:22.120\n I have to interrupt your reverie and get back to, in our lifetime at least, the short term.\n\n13:22.120 --> 13:24.800\n We only have the nearest stars to look at.\n\n13:24.800 --> 13:29.480\n It's true that there are so many stars, so many hosts for planets that might have life.\n\n13:29.480 --> 13:36.080\n But in the practical question of will we find it, it has to be a star quite close to Earth,\n\n13:36.080 --> 13:40.080\n like a few light years, tens of light years, maybe hundreds of light years.\n\n13:40.080 --> 13:46.800\n And by the way, you've introduced me to a tool of Eyes on Exoplanets, I think that NASA\n\n13:46.800 --> 13:47.800\n has put together.\n\n13:47.800 --> 13:48.800\n Eyes on Exoplanets.\n\n13:48.800 --> 13:49.800\n It's a great software.\n\n13:49.800 --> 13:50.800\n You can download it.\n\n13:50.800 --> 13:51.800\n It's so cool.\n\n13:51.800 --> 13:56.800\n But anyway, can you give a sense of who our neighbors are?\n\n13:56.800 --> 14:00.120\n You said hundreds of light years.\n\n14:00.120 --> 14:04.600\n How many stars are close by?\n\n14:04.600 --> 14:05.600\n What's our neighborhood like?\n\n14:05.600 --> 14:12.640\n Are we talking about five, 10 stars that we might actually have a chance to zoom in on?\n\n14:12.640 --> 14:16.680\n I'm talking about maybe a dozen or two dozen stars.\n\n14:16.680 --> 14:22.960\n And those with planets that look suitable for us to follow up in detail.\n\n14:22.960 --> 14:23.960\n For life.\n\n14:23.960 --> 14:24.960\n Right.\n\n14:24.960 --> 14:29.920\n But one thing that's really exciting in this field is that the very nearest star to Earth\n\n14:29.920 --> 14:34.240\n called Proxima Centauri, it's part of the Alpha Centauri star system.\n\n14:34.240 --> 14:35.240\n Cool name, by the way.\n\n14:35.240 --> 14:36.240\n Yeah, Proxima.\n\n14:36.240 --> 14:37.240\n Whoever names them.\n\n14:37.240 --> 14:38.240\n Nearby.\n\n14:38.240 --> 14:40.520\n Okay, but it sounds cooler than Proxima.\n\n14:40.520 --> 14:44.120\n Proxima Centauri appears to have a planet around it.\n\n14:44.120 --> 14:49.560\n It's about an Earth mass planet in the so called habitable zone or the Goldilocks zone\n\n14:49.560 --> 14:50.560\n of the host star.\n\n14:50.560 --> 14:52.520\n So think about how incredible that is.\n\n14:52.520 --> 14:56.880\n Like out of all the stars out there, even the very nearest star has planets and has\n\n14:56.880 --> 14:58.880\n a planet of huge interest to us.\n\n14:58.880 --> 14:59.880\n Yeah.\n\n14:59.880 --> 15:00.880\n Okay.\n\n15:00.880 --> 15:04.600\n So can we talk about that planet?\n\n15:04.600 --> 15:12.960\n What does it mean to be maybe possibly habitable?\n\n15:12.960 --> 15:14.960\n How does size come into play?\n\n15:14.960 --> 15:21.640\n How does you know what we know about gases and what kind of things are necessary for\n\n15:21.640 --> 15:22.640\n life?\n\n15:22.640 --> 15:26.800\n You know, what are the factors that you make you think that it's habitable?\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:31.280\n And by the way, I mean, maybe one way to talk about that is people know about the Drake\n\n15:31.280 --> 15:39.400\n equation, which is a very high level, almost framework to think about what is the probability\n\n15:39.400 --> 15:46.240\n that, correct me if I'm wrong, that there's life out there and intelligent life, I think.\n\n15:46.240 --> 15:47.240\n I don't know.\n\n15:47.240 --> 15:54.040\n But then you have a equation named after you now, which I think nicely focuses in on the\n\n15:54.040 --> 16:01.760\n more achievable and interesting part of that question, which is on whether there is habitable\n\n16:01.760 --> 16:04.440\n planets out there or how many, I guess.\n\n16:04.440 --> 16:05.440\n Right, right.\n\n16:05.440 --> 16:11.000\n So the funny thing is, was one time I met Frank Drake and I asked if he minded if I\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:17.360\n took his equation and kind of revamped it for this new field of exoplanet astronomy.\n\n16:17.360 --> 16:18.360\n He was totally cool with it.\n\n16:18.360 --> 16:19.360\n He's totally cool.\n\n16:19.360 --> 16:20.360\n He got total approval.\n\n16:20.360 --> 16:21.360\n Well, maybe.\n\n16:21.360 --> 16:22.360\n Okay.\n\n16:22.360 --> 16:23.360\n So sorry.\n\n16:23.360 --> 16:26.000\n I'm not sure if he'd actually read the stuff about my equation, but he was cool with it.\n\n16:26.000 --> 16:27.000\n He was cool.\n\n16:27.000 --> 16:28.000\n He was cool.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.000\n Okay.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:33.880\n So I just said like 15 different things, but maybe can you tell from your perspective,\n\n16:33.880 --> 16:37.400\n what is the Drake equation and what is, sorry, the Seager equation?\n\n16:37.400 --> 16:38.400\n Sure.\n\n16:38.400 --> 16:41.800\n Well, the Drake equation, as you said, it's a framework.\n\n16:41.800 --> 16:48.440\n It's a description of the number of civilizations out there of intelligent beings that are able\n\n16:48.440 --> 16:53.040\n to communicate with us by radio waves.\n\n16:53.040 --> 16:58.040\n So if you think of the movie Contact, you've seen Contact, right?\n\n16:58.040 --> 16:59.040\n We're listening in, actually.\n\n16:59.040 --> 17:03.320\n It's an active field of research, listening to other stars at radio wavelengths, hoping\n\n17:03.320 --> 17:07.240\n that some intelligent civilizations are sending us a message.\n\n17:07.240 --> 17:12.920\n And the Drake equation came like at the start of that whole field to put the factors down\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:18.020\n on paper to sort of illustrate what is involved to kind of estimating.\n\n17:18.020 --> 17:21.520\n And there's no real estimate or prediction of how many civilizations are out there, but\n\n17:21.520 --> 17:25.680\n it's a way to frame the question and show you each term that's involved.\n\n17:25.680 --> 17:32.140\n So I took the Drake equation and I called it a revised Drake equation and I recast it\n\n17:32.140 --> 17:37.920\n for the search for planets by more traditional astronomy means.\n\n17:37.920 --> 17:42.680\n We're looking at stars, looking for planets, looking for rocky planets, looking for planets\n\n17:42.680 --> 17:49.520\n that are the right temperature for life, looking for planets that might have life that outputs\n\n17:49.520 --> 17:52.100\n gases that we might detect in the future.\n\n17:52.100 --> 17:53.840\n It's the same spirit of the Drake equation.\n\n17:53.840 --> 17:55.480\n It's not going to give us any magic numbers.\n\n17:55.480 --> 17:58.680\n So I'm going to say, hey, here's exactly what's out there.\n\n17:58.680 --> 18:01.360\n It's meant to kind of guide, guide of where we're going.\n\n18:01.360 --> 18:06.480\n So the Drake equation did, I mean the initial equation proposed actual numbers for those\n\n18:06.480 --> 18:07.480\n variables, right?\n\n18:07.480 --> 18:08.480\n Oh yes.\n\n18:08.480 --> 18:12.240\n The equation proposed numbers and you can still plug your own numbers in.\n\n18:12.240 --> 18:15.960\n And there's this really cute website that lets you for both the Drake and my revised\n\n18:15.960 --> 18:19.280\n equation plug in some numbers and see what you got.\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:20.280\n So yeah.\n\n18:20.280 --> 18:21.280\n Okay.\n\n18:21.280 --> 18:24.600\n So what are, I mean, what are the variables, but maybe also what are like the critical\n\n18:24.600 --> 18:26.320\n variables?\n\n18:26.320 --> 18:33.640\n So in my equation, I set out to what are the numbers of inhabited planets that show signs\n\n18:33.640 --> 18:37.520\n of life by way of gases in the atmosphere that can be attributed to life.\n\n18:37.520 --> 18:39.520\n I could just walk through the terms as far as I'm aware.\n\n18:39.520 --> 18:43.200\n So the first thing I say is what are the number of stars available?\n\n18:43.200 --> 18:47.760\n And it's not that those trillions and trillions of stars everywhere.\n\n18:47.760 --> 18:51.320\n It's what are available to like a specific search.\n\n18:51.320 --> 18:57.540\n And so for example, the MIT led NASA mission TESS is surveying the sky, looking for all\n\n18:57.540 --> 19:01.600\n kinds of planets, but it can also, it also has stars.\n\n19:01.600 --> 19:04.780\n It has about 30,000 red dwarf stars.\n\n19:04.780 --> 19:08.920\n So we just take a number of stars that a given survey can access.\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:11.160\n So that's what the number of stars is.\n\n19:11.160 --> 19:16.000\n Then I wanted to know what kind of stars are quiet.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:19.120\n I called it fraction of those stars that is quiet.\n\n19:19.120 --> 19:23.680\n In the case of TESS, the way it's looking for planets is planets that transit the star.\n\n19:23.680 --> 19:27.600\n They go in front of the star as seen from the telescope, but it turns out that some\n\n19:27.600 --> 19:32.580\n stars are very active, they're variable and they brighten and dim with time and that interferes\n\n19:32.580 --> 19:33.580\n with our observation.\n\n19:33.580 --> 19:35.440\n I apologize to interrupt.\n\n19:35.440 --> 19:37.280\n So it's a transiting planet.\n\n19:37.280 --> 19:42.000\n So you're really looking for a black blob, essentially that blocks the light.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:45.560\n We're looking for a black blob that blocks the light and then trying to say something\n\n19:45.560 --> 19:51.920\n about the size of the planet from the frequency of that black blobs appearance and the size\n\n19:51.920 --> 19:53.560\n of that black blob, that kind of thing.\n\n19:53.560 --> 19:54.560\n Yeah.\n\n19:54.560 --> 19:58.560\n But let's just say that out of all the stars there are accessible to whatever telescope,\n\n19:58.560 --> 20:00.520\n some of them are just bad for whatever reason.\n\n20:00.520 --> 20:02.640\n You're not going to be able to find planets around them.\n\n20:02.640 --> 20:05.960\n So I need to know the fraction of those that are, that are good.\n\n20:05.960 --> 20:09.200\n So again, we have the number of stars, the fraction of them that we can actually find\n\n20:09.200 --> 20:10.200\n planets around.\n\n20:10.200 --> 20:16.520\n And by the way, is our sun one such, is our sun quiet?\n\n20:16.520 --> 20:17.520\n Our sun is quiet.\n\n20:17.520 --> 20:18.520\n Okay.\n\n20:18.520 --> 20:20.280\n So I have actually two terms.\n\n20:20.280 --> 20:25.580\n One describes how quiet they are and one is if we can find a planet around that star.\n\n20:25.580 --> 20:30.180\n These transiting planets, for example, not all planets transit because the planet would\n\n20:30.180 --> 20:36.360\n have to be orbiting that star in this kind of plane as viewed from you.\n\n20:36.360 --> 20:40.360\n But if a star is, for example, orbiting in the plane of the sky, it will never transit.\n\n20:40.360 --> 20:43.000\n It will never go in front of the star.\n\n20:43.000 --> 20:47.560\n So in that case, we have to have a fraction that takes into account of that kind of geometric\n\n20:47.560 --> 20:48.640\n factor.\n\n20:48.640 --> 20:52.840\n And hopefully, I mean, you can assume that it's uniformly distributed, hopefully.\n\n20:52.840 --> 20:56.980\n Yes, we can assume and there's evidence that it's uniformly distributed, yes.\n\n20:56.980 --> 21:01.600\n So then the next, so all of these factors so far, number of stars accessible to whatever\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:06.520\n telescope you're thinking about, how many stars are quiet, fraction of stars that are\n\n21:06.520 --> 21:10.380\n quiet, fraction that are observable, in this case for the geometric factor, those are all\n\n21:10.380 --> 21:11.380\n things we can measure.\n\n21:11.380 --> 21:14.920\n And there's one more term in the secret equation we can measure.\n\n21:14.920 --> 21:18.540\n I call it fraction of planets in the habitable zone.\n\n21:18.540 --> 21:23.760\n Because believe it or not, we have a handle on that for a certain set of stars.\n\n21:23.760 --> 21:28.520\n We know from our, the Kepler Space Telescope that operated for a number of years, we have\n\n21:28.520 --> 21:31.840\n estimates for how many planets are in the so called habitable zone of the host star\n\n21:31.840 --> 21:33.420\n for a certain type of star.\n\n21:33.420 --> 21:34.960\n So all those we have measurable.\n\n21:34.960 --> 21:39.280\n And then like the Drake equation itself, there are some terms we can not measure.\n\n21:39.280 --> 21:46.280\n And those ones, I call them FL, fraction of all those planets that have life on them.\n\n21:46.280 --> 21:47.400\n Because we don't know what that is.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:55.300\n And FS, I called for spectroscopy, the fraction that have, we can use our telescope and instrument\n\n21:55.300 --> 21:58.080\n tools to look for light.\n\n21:58.080 --> 22:03.880\n The FS was the ones that, the planets that have life that actually gives off a gas, a\n\n22:03.880 --> 22:10.160\n useful gas that might accumulate in the atmosphere, so we could eventually observe it.\n\n22:10.160 --> 22:12.280\n How do the FL and FS interplay?\n\n22:12.280 --> 22:14.320\n So these are separate terms?\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:15.560\n Separate terms.\n\n22:15.560 --> 22:16.560\n And so?\n\n22:16.560 --> 22:23.720\n So for example, you could imagine, so for example, you could imagine life, like us humans,\n\n22:23.720 --> 22:26.680\n we breathe out carbon dioxide.\n\n22:26.680 --> 22:29.560\n And our planet Earth, we already have a lot of carbon dioxide on it.\n\n22:29.560 --> 22:33.600\n Well, we have hundreds of parts per million, but it has a really strong signal.\n\n22:33.600 --> 22:37.500\n So us humans breathing out carbon dioxide, it's not helpful for any intelligent beings\n\n22:37.500 --> 22:41.120\n that are looking back at Earth, because there's already a lot of, there's already enough carbon\n\n22:41.120 --> 22:43.060\n dioxide, we're not adding to it.\n\n22:43.060 --> 22:47.320\n So if there is life on a planet, and it's outputting a boring gas that's not helpful\n\n22:47.320 --> 22:54.440\n for us to uniquely identify as being made by life versus just being there anyway, then\n\n22:54.440 --> 22:55.440\n it's not helpful.\n\n22:55.440 --> 22:57.960\n So I separated those two terms out.\n\n22:57.960 --> 23:04.320\n Soon I think we'll have evidence that planets that can support life at least are common.\n\n23:04.320 --> 23:11.080\n So okay, this is such an awesome topic, I have a million questions.\n\n23:11.080 --> 23:16.080\n What okay, I know this is a little bit of speculation, but what's your sense about that,\n\n23:16.080 --> 23:23.760\n I think FS, which is like, that life would produce interesting gases that would be able\n\n23:23.760 --> 23:30.480\n to detect, like, is there, one, is there scientific evidence and, and second, is there some intuition\n\n23:30.480 --> 23:36.820\n around life producing gases with detectable hints in terms of chemistry?\n\n23:36.820 --> 23:43.160\n So interestingly enough, that entire question relates to, I'm going to say almost my life's\n\n23:43.160 --> 23:46.520\n work, the work I'm doing now and the work I'm doing for the next 20 years, and I wish\n\n23:46.520 --> 23:51.440\n I could give you a concrete number, like 1%, like on the worst days, it's 1%, let's say\n\n23:51.440 --> 23:52.440\n in my mind.\n\n23:52.440 --> 23:54.480\n You know, in the best days, it's like 80%.\n\n23:54.480 --> 23:58.400\n And I could actually go into a lot of detail here, but I'll just give you the simplest\n\n23:58.400 --> 23:59.920\n things.\n\n23:59.920 --> 24:05.800\n So first of all, we make an assumption that like us, and our life here on Earth, life\n\n24:05.800 --> 24:07.700\n uses chemistry.\n\n24:07.700 --> 24:13.120\n So we use chemistry because we eat food, we breathe air, and we have metabolism that to\n\n24:13.120 --> 24:18.820\n break down food to get energy to store energy, and then ultimately to use it.\n\n24:18.820 --> 24:22.560\n And all life here has some kind of byproduct in doing all that, some kind of waste product\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:24.400\n that goes into the atmosphere.\n\n24:24.400 --> 24:28.700\n So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry.\n\n24:28.700 --> 24:34.280\n Some people have imagined, like, let's imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy, just\n\n24:34.280 --> 24:37.120\n getting energy and using it without storing it.\n\n24:37.120 --> 24:40.840\n And if there was life like that, it might not need to output a gas.\n\n24:40.840 --> 24:44.040\n So we make this basic assumption of chemistry, that's the first thing.\n\n24:44.040 --> 24:47.960\n The second more complicated thing that I and my team work on is what happens to the gas\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:51.980\n once it is produced by life, it goes into the atmosphere.\n\n24:51.980 --> 24:59.600\n And a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately, actually, by ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen.\n\n24:59.600 --> 25:03.540\n Oxygen is incredibly destructive to a lot of gases.\n\n25:03.540 --> 25:07.280\n So the gas can be produced by life, but it could be just completely destroyed by its\n\n25:07.280 --> 25:08.280\n environment.\n\n25:08.280 --> 25:13.800\n I guess we should pause on that, that you mentioned your life's work.\n\n25:13.800 --> 25:19.280\n This is just the beautiful idea that it's kind of paralyzing when you look out there\n\n25:19.280 --> 25:22.720\n and you wonder, is there a life out there?\n\n25:22.720 --> 25:27.360\n It's the first paralyzing, actually, before I encountered your work, I feel like an idiot.\n\n25:27.360 --> 25:32.860\n But you know, it feels like there's no tool to answer that question.\n\n25:32.860 --> 25:40.000\n And then what you kind of provided is this cool idea that it might be possible to answer\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:41.240\n that by looking at the gases.\n\n25:41.240 --> 25:45.720\n I mean, that's a really interesting, that's a beautiful idea.\n\n25:45.720 --> 25:55.280\n And yeah, so we could just pause on like, that's a powerful tool, I think, to build\n\n25:55.280 --> 25:57.800\n the intuition around, because I was totally clueless about it.\n\n25:57.800 --> 25:59.440\n And that was kind of exciting.\n\n25:59.440 --> 26:05.760\n I mean, I'm sure there's folks probably early on in your life who were very skeptical about\n\n26:05.760 --> 26:06.760\n this notion.\n\n26:06.760 --> 26:13.320\n Well, maybe I'm not sure, but generally you would want to be skeptical, it's like, well,\n\n26:13.320 --> 26:17.000\n all these kinds of other things could generate gases, you know, all those kinds of things.\n\n26:17.000 --> 26:18.000\n Oh, that's so true.\n\n26:18.000 --> 26:23.240\n And that's a big part of this growing field is how to make sure that this gas isn't produced\n\n26:23.240 --> 26:24.240\n by another effect.\n\n26:24.240 --> 26:29.000\n But I do want to, you know, again, pausing on that and going back a bit.\n\n26:29.000 --> 26:33.100\n It's incredible to think, but like, at least almost 100 years ago, there's a record of\n\n26:33.100 --> 26:38.720\n someone talking about the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere.\n\n26:38.720 --> 26:40.240\n That idea was floating about somewhere.\n\n26:40.240 --> 26:42.040\n Yes, it was totally floating about.\n\n26:42.040 --> 26:48.440\n And it comes down to oxygen, which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.\n\n26:48.440 --> 26:50.600\n And you know, we rely on oxygen to breathe.\n\n26:50.600 --> 26:54.280\n You know, when you hear about the people in Mount Everest running out of air, they're\n\n26:54.280 --> 26:57.660\n really running out of oxygen, well, they're running out of oxygen because the air is getting\n\n26:57.660 --> 27:01.680\n thinner as they climb up the mountain.\n\n27:01.680 --> 27:08.680\n But without plants and bacteria, there's bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen\n\n27:08.680 --> 27:09.680\n as a waste product.\n\n27:09.680 --> 27:13.040\n Without those, we would have virtually no oxygen.\n\n27:13.040 --> 27:15.480\n Our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen.\n\n27:15.480 --> 27:21.900\n So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth, is oxygen the strong indicator here?\n\n27:21.900 --> 27:22.900\n Oxygen is a huge indicator.\n\n27:22.900 --> 27:26.720\n And that's what we're hoping, that there is an intelligent civilization not too far from\n\n27:26.720 --> 27:31.440\n here around a planet orbiting a nearby star with the kind of telescopes we're trying to\n\n27:31.440 --> 27:32.440\n build.\n\n27:32.440 --> 27:36.740\n And they're looking back at our sun and they've seen our Earth and they see oxygen.\n\n27:36.740 --> 27:41.620\n And they probably won't be like 100.0% sure that there's life making it.\n\n27:41.620 --> 27:45.820\n But if they go through all the possible scenarios, they'll be left with a pretty strong hint\n\n27:45.820 --> 27:46.820\n that there's life here.\n\n27:46.820 --> 27:47.820\n Yeah.\n\n27:47.820 --> 27:55.360\n Okay, but how do you detect that type of gases that are on the planet from a distance?\n\n27:55.360 --> 28:00.160\n And that's going back to that, that's what people were skeptical about.\n\n28:00.160 --> 28:04.800\n When I first started working on exoplanets a long time ago, people didn't believe we\n\n28:04.800 --> 28:09.500\n would ever, ever, ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind.\n\n28:09.500 --> 28:11.320\n And now dozens of them are studied.\n\n28:11.320 --> 28:14.520\n There's a whole field of people, hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres\n\n28:14.520 --> 28:15.520\n actually.\n\n28:15.520 --> 28:16.520\n Wow.\n\n28:16.520 --> 28:20.240\n But first there was a point where people didn't even know there was exoplanets, right?\n\n28:20.240 --> 28:23.100\n When was the first exoplanet detected?\n\n28:23.100 --> 28:27.200\n The first exoplanet around a sun like star anyway was detected in the mid 1990s.\n\n28:27.200 --> 28:29.600\n That was a big deal.\n\n28:29.600 --> 28:30.600\n Kind of vaguely remember that.\n\n28:30.600 --> 28:34.840\n Well, at the time it was a big deal, but it was also incredibly controversial.\n\n28:34.840 --> 28:41.280\n Because in exoplanets, we only had one example of a planetary system, our own solar system.\n\n28:41.280 --> 28:48.000\n And in our solar system, Jupiter, our big massive planet, is really far from our star.\n\n28:48.000 --> 28:53.000\n And this first exoplanet around a sun like star was incredibly close to its star, so\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:56.180\n close that people just couldn't believe it was a planet actually.\n\n28:56.180 --> 29:00.080\n So maybe zoom out, what the heck is an exoplanet?\n\n29:00.080 --> 29:05.500\n An exoplanet is our name, like is the name that we call a planet orbiting a star other\n\n29:05.500 --> 29:07.000\n than our sun.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:08.000\n Right.\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.000\n Extrasolar, I guess is another.\n\n29:09.000 --> 29:10.000\n You can call it extrasolar.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:11.000\n Okay.\n\n29:11.000 --> 29:12.000\n Exoplanet is simpler.\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:17.140\n But I think it's worth pausing to remember that each one of those stars out there in\n\n29:17.140 --> 29:18.800\n our night sky is a sun.\n\n29:18.800 --> 29:23.440\n And you know, our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.\n\n29:23.440 --> 29:29.160\n And so for a long time, people have wondered, do those other stars or other suns have planets?\n\n29:29.160 --> 29:30.160\n And they do.\n\n29:30.160 --> 29:34.040\n And it appears that nearly every star has a planet, has a planet we call exoplanet.\n\n29:34.040 --> 29:37.000\n And there are thousands of known exoplanets already.\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:42.120\n So there's already, yeah, like, there's so many things about space that it's hard to\n\n29:42.120 --> 29:47.520\n put into one's brain, because it starts filling it with awe.\n\n29:47.520 --> 29:54.920\n So yeah, if you visualize the fact that the stars that we see in the sky aren't just stars,\n\n29:54.920 --> 29:57.160\n they're like, they're suns.\n\n29:57.160 --> 30:03.520\n And they very likely, as you're saying, would have planets around them.\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:11.240\n There's all these planets roaming about in this like, dimly lit darkness, with potentially\n\n30:11.240 --> 30:12.240\n life.\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:14.920\n I mean, it's just mind blowing.\n\n30:14.920 --> 30:23.120\n But maybe can you give a brief, like, history of discovering all the exoplanets?\n\n30:23.120 --> 30:26.320\n So there's no exoplanets in the 90s.\n\n30:26.320 --> 30:28.500\n And then there's a lot of exoplanets now.\n\n30:28.500 --> 30:29.600\n So how did that come about?\n\n30:29.600 --> 30:31.520\n So many planets.\n\n30:31.520 --> 30:32.520\n How did it come about?\n\n30:32.520 --> 30:37.120\n Well, maybe another way to ask is, what is the methodology that was used to discover\n\n30:37.120 --> 30:38.120\n them?\n\n30:38.120 --> 30:39.120\n I can say that.\n\n30:39.120 --> 30:43.680\n But I'd like to just say something else first where, so exoplanets, you know, the line\n\n30:43.680 --> 30:47.160\n between what is considered completely crazy.\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:51.600\n And what is considered mainstream research, legit, is constantly shifting.\n\n30:51.600 --> 30:52.600\n This is awesome.\n\n30:52.600 --> 30:53.600\n Yeah.\n\n30:53.600 --> 30:56.040\n So before, when I started on exoplanets, it was still sketchy.\n\n30:56.040 --> 31:01.280\n Like, it wasn't considered a career, a thing, a place where you should be investing.\n\n31:01.280 --> 31:06.840\n And right now, now, today, it's so many people are working in this field, a good, I don't\n\n31:06.840 --> 31:08.480\n know, at least 1000, probably more.\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:10.840\n I don't know if that sounds like a lot to you, but it's a lot.\n\n31:10.840 --> 31:13.800\n No, it's a legitimate field of inquiry.\n\n31:13.800 --> 31:14.800\n Yeah.\n\n31:14.800 --> 31:15.800\n Legitimate field of inquiry.\n\n31:15.800 --> 31:18.000\n And what's helped us is everything that's helped everyone else.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:21.720\n It's software, it's computers, it's hardware.\n\n31:21.720 --> 31:22.720\n It's like our phones.\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:23.960\n You have a fantastic detector in there.\n\n31:23.960 --> 31:25.120\n Like, they didn't always have that.\n\n31:25.120 --> 31:28.080\n I don't know if you remember the so called olden days.\n\n31:28.080 --> 31:29.300\n We didn't have digital cameras.\n\n31:29.300 --> 31:30.580\n We had film.\n\n31:30.580 --> 31:33.680\n You take a film camera, you send the film away, and eventually it comes back, and then\n\n31:33.680 --> 31:34.680\n you see your pictures.\n\n31:34.680 --> 31:35.680\n And they could all be horrible.\n\n31:35.680 --> 31:36.680\n Yeah.\n\n31:36.680 --> 31:37.680\n So yeah, I mean, digital.\n\n31:37.680 --> 31:38.680\n It just changed everything.\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:39.680\n Data changed everything.\n\n31:39.680 --> 31:45.920\n Yeah, and so one thing that really helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive.\n\n31:45.920 --> 31:51.100\n Because when we're looking for the transiting planets, what we're doing is we're monitoring\n\n31:51.100 --> 31:53.840\n a star's brightness as a function of time.\n\n31:53.840 --> 31:58.840\n It's like click, taking a picture of the stars every few seconds or minutes.\n\n31:58.840 --> 32:02.960\n And we're measuring the brightness of a star, like every frame.\n\n32:02.960 --> 32:06.700\n And we're looking for a drop in brightness that's characteristic of a planet going in\n\n32:06.700 --> 32:11.680\n front of the star, and then finishing its so called transit.\n\n32:11.680 --> 32:15.960\n And to make that measurement, we have to have precise detectors.\n\n32:15.960 --> 32:22.080\n And the detectors that are making the measurement, can you do it from Earth?\n\n32:22.080 --> 32:25.920\n Are they floating about in space, like what kind of telescope?\n\n32:25.920 --> 32:30.260\n So on the ground, people are using telescopes, small telescopes that are almost just like\n\n32:30.260 --> 32:32.520\n a glorified telephoto lens.\n\n32:32.520 --> 32:35.140\n And they're looking at big swaths of the sky.\n\n32:35.140 --> 32:38.820\n And from the ground, people can find giant planets like the size of Jupiter.\n\n32:38.820 --> 32:41.700\n So it's about 10 to 12 times the size of Earth.\n\n32:41.700 --> 32:46.320\n We can find big planets, because we can reach about 1% precision.\n\n32:46.320 --> 32:48.680\n So not sure how technical you want to get.\n\n32:48.680 --> 32:53.080\n Well, how many pixels are we talking about?\n\n32:53.080 --> 32:56.820\n You mentioned phones, there's a bunch of megapixels, I think.\n\n32:56.820 --> 33:01.240\n So for exoplanets, you want to think about it as like a pixel or less than a pixel, we're\n\n33:01.240 --> 33:03.940\n not getting any information.\n\n33:03.940 --> 33:08.040\n But to be more technical, our telescope spreads the light out over many pixels, but we're\n\n33:08.040 --> 33:09.300\n not getting information.\n\n33:09.300 --> 33:12.300\n We're not tiling the planet with pixels.\n\n33:12.300 --> 33:16.320\n It's just like a point of light, or in most cases, we don't even see the planet itself,\n\n33:16.320 --> 33:17.920\n just the planet's effect on the star.\n\n33:17.920 --> 33:22.640\n But another thing that really helped was computers, because transiting planets are actually quite\n\n33:22.640 --> 33:23.640\n rare.\n\n33:23.640 --> 33:25.560\n I mean, they don't all go in front of their star.\n\n33:25.560 --> 33:29.880\n And so to find transiting planets, we look at a big part of the sky at once, or we look\n\n33:29.880 --> 33:34.100\n at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, or even in some cases, millions of stars at\n\n33:34.100 --> 33:35.520\n one time.\n\n33:35.520 --> 33:39.400\n And so you're not going to do this by hand, going through a million stars, counting up\n\n33:39.400 --> 33:40.400\n the brightness.\n\n33:40.400 --> 33:47.600\n So we have computer software and computer code that does the job for us and counts the\n\n33:47.600 --> 33:51.880\n brightness and looks for a signal that could be due to a transiting planet.\n\n33:51.880 --> 33:59.440\n And I just finished a job called Deputy Science Director for the MIT led NASA mission test.\n\n33:59.440 --> 34:05.880\n And it was my purview to make sure that we got the planet candidates, the transiting\n\n34:05.880 --> 34:10.280\n light curves, out to the community so people could follow them up and figure out if they're\n\n34:10.280 --> 34:13.360\n actual planets or false positives.\n\n34:13.360 --> 34:19.260\n So publish the data so that people could just, all the data scientists out there could crunch\n\n34:19.260 --> 34:21.080\n and see if they can discover something.\n\n34:21.080 --> 34:22.080\n They can discover something.\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:26.760\n And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission is that all the data becomes public as soon\n\n34:26.760 --> 34:28.360\n as possible.\n\n34:28.360 --> 34:33.680\n It's not as easy as it sounds, though, to download the data and look for planets.\n\n34:33.680 --> 34:38.600\n But there is a group called PlanetHunters.org, and they take the data and they actually crowdsource\n\n34:38.600 --> 34:40.200\n it out to people to look for planets.\n\n34:40.200 --> 34:41.200\n Yeah.\n\n34:41.200 --> 34:44.940\n And they often find signals that our computers and our team missed.\n\n34:44.940 --> 34:46.880\n So we mentioned exoplanets.\n\n34:46.880 --> 34:51.920\n What about Earth like, or I don't know what the right distinction is, is it habitable\n\n34:51.920 --> 34:55.940\n or is it Earth like planets, but what are those different categories and how can we\n\n34:55.940 --> 34:57.840\n tell the difference and detect each?\n\n34:57.840 --> 34:58.840\n Right, right.\n\n34:58.840 --> 35:01.360\n So we're not at Earth like planets yet.\n\n35:01.360 --> 35:06.680\n All the planets we're finding are so different from what we have in our solar system.\n\n35:06.680 --> 35:08.640\n They're just easier planets to find, but like...\n\n35:08.640 --> 35:09.640\n In which way?\n\n35:09.640 --> 35:14.740\n For example, there could be a Jupiter sized planet where an Earth should be.\n\n35:14.740 --> 35:20.720\n We find planets that are the same size as Earth, but are orbiting way closer to their\n\n35:20.720 --> 35:24.080\n star than Mercury is to our sun.\n\n35:24.080 --> 35:29.160\n They're so close that, because close to a star means they also orbit faster.\n\n35:29.160 --> 35:33.860\n And some of these hot super Earths we call them, their year, their time to go around\n\n35:33.860 --> 35:36.940\n their star is less than a day.\n\n35:36.940 --> 35:40.480\n And they're heated so much by their star, they're heated so much by the star.\n\n35:40.480 --> 35:42.920\n We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock.\n\n35:42.920 --> 35:47.520\n So instead of running out by the bay or the river, you'll have like liquid lava.\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:51.480\n There'll be liquid lava lakes on these planets, we think.\n\n35:51.480 --> 35:53.520\n And life can't survive.\n\n35:53.520 --> 35:54.520\n Way too hot.\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:59.760\n The molecules needed for life just wouldn't be able to survive those temperatures.\n\n35:59.760 --> 36:00.760\n We have some other planets.\n\n36:00.760 --> 36:07.000\n One of the most mysterious things out there, factoid, if you will, is that the most common\n\n36:07.000 --> 36:12.920\n type of planet we know about so far is a planet that's in between Earth and Neptune size.\n\n36:12.920 --> 36:15.680\n It's two to three times the size of Earth.\n\n36:15.680 --> 36:19.840\n And we have no solar system counterpart of that planet.\n\n36:19.840 --> 36:24.000\n That is like going outside to the forest and finding some kind of creature or animal that\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:27.360\n just no one has ever seen before and then discovering that is the most common thing\n\n36:27.360 --> 36:29.320\n out there.\n\n36:29.320 --> 36:30.560\n And so we're not even sure what they are.\n\n36:30.560 --> 36:34.300\n We have a lot of thoughts as to the different types of planet it could be, but people don't\n\n36:34.300 --> 36:35.300\n really know.\n\n36:35.300 --> 36:37.560\n I mean, what are your thoughts about what it could be?\n\n36:37.560 --> 36:43.260\n Well, one thought, and this is more when we want to be rather than might be, is that these\n\n36:43.260 --> 36:48.540\n so called mini Neptunes, we call them, that they are water worlds, that they could be\n\n36:48.540 --> 36:54.360\n scaled up versions of Jupiter's icy moons, such that they are planets that are made of\n\n36:54.360 --> 36:57.400\n more than half of water by mass.\n\n36:57.400 --> 37:02.040\n And what's the connection between water and life and the possibility of seeing that from\n\n37:02.040 --> 37:03.600\n a gas perspective?\n\n37:03.600 --> 37:07.580\n Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water.\n\n37:07.580 --> 37:12.400\n And so there's been this idea in astronomy or astrobiology for a long time called follow\n\n37:12.400 --> 37:16.960\n the water, find water, that will give you a chance of finding life, but we could still\n\n37:16.960 --> 37:24.680\n zoom out and the community consensus is that we need some kind of liquid for life to originate\n\n37:24.680 --> 37:28.360\n and to survive because molecules have to react.\n\n37:28.360 --> 37:31.560\n You don't have a way that molecules can interact with each other.\n\n37:31.560 --> 37:32.800\n You can't really make anything.\n\n37:32.800 --> 37:38.100\n And so when we think of all the liquids out there, water is the most abundant liquid in\n\n37:38.100 --> 37:39.640\n terms of planetary materials.\n\n37:39.640 --> 37:40.920\n There really aren't that many liquids.\n\n37:40.920 --> 37:44.640\n Like I mentioned, liquid rock, way too hot for life.\n\n37:44.640 --> 37:49.600\n We have some really cold liquids, like almost gasoline, like ethane and methane lakes that\n\n37:49.600 --> 37:52.880\n have been found on one of Saturn's moons, Titan.\n\n37:52.880 --> 37:53.920\n That's so cold though.\n\n37:53.920 --> 37:57.420\n And for exoplanets, we can't study really cold planets because they're just simply too\n\n37:57.420 --> 38:00.480\n dark and too cold.\n\n38:00.480 --> 38:05.040\n So we usually are just left with looking for planets with liquid water.\n\n38:05.040 --> 38:12.920\n And to your point, remember as we talked about how planets are less than a pixel in that\n\n38:12.920 --> 38:15.440\n way to say, so we can't see oceans on planet.\n\n38:15.440 --> 38:19.520\n We're not going to see continents and oceans, not yet anyway, but we can see gases in the\n\n38:19.520 --> 38:20.520\n atmosphere.\n\n38:20.520 --> 38:26.840\n And if it's a small rocky planet, and this is going into some more detail, if we see\n\n38:26.840 --> 38:31.200\n a small rocky planet with water vapor in the atmosphere, we're pretty sure that means there\n\n38:31.200 --> 38:37.480\n has to be a liquid water reservoir because it's not intuitive in any way, but water is\n\n38:37.480 --> 38:42.360\n broken up by ultraviolet radiation from the star or from the sun.\n\n38:42.360 --> 38:47.600\n And on most planets when water is broken up into H and O, the H, the hydrogen will escape\n\n38:47.600 --> 38:48.600\n to space.\n\n38:48.600 --> 38:53.440\n Because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium filled balloon, it\n\n38:53.440 --> 38:58.860\n floats upwards and hydrogen is a light gas and will leave from the planet.\n\n38:58.860 --> 39:03.220\n So ultimately if you have water, unless there's an ocean, like a way to keep replenishing\n\n39:03.220 --> 39:08.480\n water vapor in the atmosphere, that water vapor should be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.\n\n39:08.480 --> 39:16.400\n Got it, so there's a, okay, so there's a need for liquid, I mean, I guess it was water.\n\n39:16.400 --> 39:21.080\n Is water essential or are the liquids, I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated.\n\n39:21.080 --> 39:24.160\n It does, but you know, there's not an infinite number of liquids.\n\n39:24.160 --> 39:28.680\n There's maybe like five liquids that can exist inside or on the surface of a planet.\n\n39:28.680 --> 39:32.440\n And water is the one that exists for the largest range of temperatures and pressures.\n\n39:32.440 --> 39:37.360\n And it's also the easiest type of planet for us to find and study is one with water vapor\n\n39:37.360 --> 39:41.360\n rather than a cold planet that has ethane and methane lakes.\n\n39:41.360 --> 39:48.760\n What's your personal, in terms of solar systems and planets that you're most hopeful about\n\n39:48.760 --> 39:57.320\n in terms of our closest neighbors that you kind of have a sense that there might be somebody\n\n39:57.320 --> 40:02.840\n living over there, whether it's bacteria or somebody that looks like us.\n\n40:02.840 --> 40:06.520\n I'm hopeful that every star nearby has a planet.\n\n40:06.520 --> 40:07.520\n That has some life.\n\n40:07.520 --> 40:09.840\n Because it almost has to for us to make progress.\n\n40:09.840 --> 40:12.560\n We have to have that dream condition.\n\n40:12.560 --> 40:16.760\n So the dream condition is like life is just super abundant out there.\n\n40:16.760 --> 40:21.280\n Yeah, the dream, yes, the dream condition is that life is super abundant and it's based\n\n40:21.280 --> 40:27.480\n on the thought that if there is a planet with water and continents, that it also has the\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:36.300\n ingredients for life and that the kind of base kernel thought is that if the ingredients\n\n40:36.300 --> 40:37.680\n for life is there, life will form.\n\n40:37.680 --> 40:38.680\n Life will form.\n\n40:38.680 --> 40:39.680\n That's what we're holding on to.\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:41.880\n With a relatively high probability.\n\n40:41.880 --> 40:43.520\n Yes, that's it.\n\n40:43.520 --> 40:46.740\n Okay, let's go into land of speculation.\n\n40:46.740 --> 40:49.600\n What about intelligent life?\n\n40:49.600 --> 40:56.320\n Us humans consider ourselves intelligent, surprisingly or unsurprisingly.\n\n40:56.320 --> 41:02.560\n Do you think about from your perspective of looking at planets from a gas composition\n\n41:02.560 --> 41:10.400\n perspective and in general of how we might see intelligent life and your intuition about\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:12.400\n whether that life is even out there?\n\n41:12.400 --> 41:14.760\n I think the life is out there somewhere.\n\n41:14.760 --> 41:17.520\n The huge numbers of stars and planets.\n\n41:17.520 --> 41:21.480\n I like to think that life had a chance to evolve to be intelligent.\n\n41:21.480 --> 41:26.620\n I'm not convinced the life is anywhere near here, only because if it's hard for intelligent\n\n41:26.620 --> 41:29.720\n life to evolve, then it will be far away by definition.\n\n41:29.720 --> 41:36.080\n Well, the sad thing is maybe from the artificial intelligence perspective is it makes me sad\n\n41:36.080 --> 41:43.160\n there might be intelligent life out there that we're just not like the pathways of evolution\n\n41:43.160 --> 41:47.440\n can go in all these different directions where we might not be able to communicate with it\n\n41:47.440 --> 41:52.720\n or even know that or even detect its intelligence or even comprehend its intelligence.\n\n41:52.720 --> 41:59.480\n I'm convinced cats are more intelligent than humans that we're just not able to comprehend\n\n41:59.480 --> 42:04.980\n the measures, the proper measures of their intelligence.\n\n42:04.980 --> 42:06.200\n My dog is so funny.\n\n42:06.200 --> 42:07.200\n He's a golden doodle.\n\n42:07.200 --> 42:08.280\n His name's Leo.\n\n42:08.280 --> 42:12.420\n We joke that he's either a really dumb dog and sorry, he's not here to defend himself,\n\n42:12.420 --> 42:16.280\n but he's either really dumb or he's a super genius just pretending to be dumb.\n\n42:16.280 --> 42:17.280\n Yeah.\n\n42:17.280 --> 42:25.400\n And it's possible he's a multidimensional projection of alien life here monitoring one\n\n42:25.400 --> 42:33.480\n of the top scientists in the world trying to find aliens just to make sure that humans\n\n42:33.480 --> 42:34.480\n don't get out of hand.\n\n42:34.480 --> 42:35.480\n That's funny.\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:39.960\n Oh, I'm definitely going to go in and ask him about that when I get home.\n\n42:39.960 --> 42:40.960\n She's onto something.\n\n42:40.960 --> 42:41.960\n Yeah.\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:46.580\n What might we look for in terms of signs of intelligent life?\n\n42:46.580 --> 42:54.240\n From your toolkit, do you think there are things that we might be able to use or maybe\n\n42:54.240 --> 43:00.960\n in the next couple of decades discover that would be different than life that's like bacteria,\n\n43:00.960 --> 43:03.080\n that's primitive life?\n\n43:03.080 --> 43:06.320\n I still love SETI, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.\n\n43:06.320 --> 43:10.880\n I like to hope that if there is a civilization out there, they're trying to send us a message.\n\n43:10.880 --> 43:13.040\n I think, like, think about it, I don't know.\n\n43:13.040 --> 43:14.040\n What are your thoughts?\n\n43:14.040 --> 43:18.720\n Like, if you think about our Earth, there's no structure we've built that intelligent\n\n43:18.720 --> 43:20.680\n civilizations could see from far away.\n\n43:20.680 --> 43:23.640\n There's literally nothing, not even the Great Wall of China.\n\n43:23.640 --> 43:27.700\n And so to think, like, why would this other civilization build a giant structure that\n\n43:27.700 --> 43:28.700\n we could see?\n\n43:28.700 --> 43:33.760\n Yeah, so with SETI, the idea is that we're both trying to hear signals and send signals,\n\n43:33.760 --> 43:34.760\n right?\n\n43:34.760 --> 43:35.760\n Well, we haven't sent one.\n\n43:35.760 --> 43:37.240\n They call that METI, messaging.\n\n43:37.240 --> 43:42.880\n And there's a big kind of fear over METI, because do you want to tell them you're here?\n\n43:42.880 --> 43:45.040\n It's kind of this, like, let's wait till they call us.\n\n43:45.040 --> 43:46.040\n Yeah.\n\n43:46.040 --> 43:51.960\n It's like a dating game, you have to, like, how many days do I wait before I call, kind\n\n43:51.960 --> 43:52.960\n of thing.\n\n43:52.960 --> 43:53.960\n Yeah.\n\n43:53.960 --> 43:57.360\n But the funny thing is, if no one's sending us a message, if everybody's only listening,\n\n43:57.360 --> 43:59.920\n how do you make progress?\n\n43:59.920 --> 44:00.920\n That's right.\n\n44:00.920 --> 44:04.960\n And, I mean, but there's also, there's the Voyager spacecraft that we have these little\n\n44:04.960 --> 44:09.960\n pixels of robots flying out all over the place.\n\n44:09.960 --> 44:13.320\n Some of them, like the Voyager, reach out really far.\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:15.200\n And they have some stuff on them.\n\n44:15.200 --> 44:16.200\n Okay, I just...\n\n44:16.200 --> 44:19.160\n We do, we have the Voyager, but they're not really going anywhere in particular.\n\n44:19.160 --> 44:21.960\n And they're moving very, very slowly on a cosmic scale.\n\n44:21.960 --> 44:22.960\n Yeah.\n\n44:22.960 --> 44:24.760\n And me saying they're far is kind of silly.\n\n44:24.760 --> 44:25.760\n Yeah.\n\n44:25.760 --> 44:26.760\n It's all relative in astronomy.\n\n44:26.760 --> 44:27.760\n It's all relative.\n\n44:27.760 --> 44:28.760\n Yeah.\n\n44:28.760 --> 44:29.760\n Yeah.\n\n44:29.760 --> 44:30.760\n I just...\n\n44:30.760 --> 44:36.320\n So from the, if you look at Earth from an alien perspective, from visually and from\n\n44:36.320 --> 44:44.880\n gas composition, I wonder if it's possible to determine the degree of maybe productive\n\n44:44.880 --> 44:45.880\n energy use.\n\n44:45.880 --> 44:51.240\n I wonder if it's possible to tell, like, how busy these Earthlings are.\n\n44:51.240 --> 44:55.720\n Well, let's zoom out again and think about oxygen.\n\n44:55.720 --> 45:00.200\n So when cyanobacteria arose like billions of years ago and figured out how to harness\n\n45:00.200 --> 45:05.240\n the energy of the sun for photosynthesis, they reengineered the entire atmosphere.\n\n45:05.240 --> 45:09.080\n 20% of the atmosphere has oxygen now.\n\n45:09.080 --> 45:11.040\n Like that is a huge scale.\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:15.080\n You know, they almost poisoned everything else by making this, what was apparently very\n\n45:15.080 --> 45:17.400\n poisonous to everything that was alive.\n\n45:17.400 --> 45:18.400\n But imagine...\n\n45:18.400 --> 45:19.400\n So are we doing anything at that scale?\n\n45:19.400 --> 45:23.600\n Like, are we changing anything at like 20% of the Earth with a giant structure or 20%\n\n45:23.600 --> 45:24.840\n of this or 20% of that?\n\n45:24.840 --> 45:26.200\n Like we aren't actually.\n\n45:26.200 --> 45:27.200\n Yeah.\n\n45:27.200 --> 45:28.200\n Yeah.\n\n45:28.200 --> 45:32.400\n That's humbling to think that we're not actually having that much of an impact.\n\n45:32.400 --> 45:33.400\n I know.\n\n45:33.400 --> 45:35.440\n But we are because in a way we're destroying our entire planet.\n\n45:35.440 --> 45:40.520\n But it's humbling to think that from far away, people probably can't even tell.\n\n45:40.520 --> 45:45.000\n But from the perspective of the planet, when we say we're destroying, you know, global\n\n45:45.000 --> 45:51.320\n warming, all that kind of stuff, what we really mean is we're destroying it for a bunch of\n\n45:51.320 --> 45:54.040\n different species, including humans.\n\n45:54.040 --> 45:55.640\n But like, I think the Earth will be okay.\n\n45:55.640 --> 46:00.840\n Oh, the Earth will be, the Earth will remain, whatever happens to us, the Earth will still\n\n46:00.840 --> 46:01.840\n be here.\n\n46:01.840 --> 46:03.800\n And it'll still be difficult to detect any difference.\n\n46:03.800 --> 46:09.560\n Like it's sad to think that if humans destroy ourselves, except potentially with nuclear\n\n46:09.560 --> 46:12.280\n war, it'd be hard to tell that anything even happened.\n\n46:12.280 --> 46:13.280\n Yeah.\n\n46:13.280 --> 46:15.800\n It's hard to tell from far away that anything happened.\n\n46:15.800 --> 46:17.680\n What about, what are your thoughts now?\n\n46:17.680 --> 46:21.760\n This is really getting into speculation land.\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:28.220\n You've mentioned exoplanets were in the realm of, you know, this is beautiful edge between\n\n46:28.220 --> 46:31.600\n science and science fiction.\n\n46:31.600 --> 46:37.940\n That some of us, a rare few are brave enough to walk, I think in academia, you were brave\n\n46:37.940 --> 46:39.880\n enough to do that.\n\n46:39.880 --> 46:47.360\n I think in some sense, artificial intelligence sometimes walks that line a little bit.\n\n46:47.360 --> 46:52.760\n There is so much excitement about extraterrestrial life and aliens in this world.\n\n46:52.760 --> 46:59.600\n I mean, I don't know what, how to comprehend that excitement, but to me, it's great to\n\n46:59.600 --> 47:06.800\n see people curious because to me, extraterrestrial life and aliens is at the core, a scientific\n\n47:06.800 --> 47:08.400\n question.\n\n47:08.400 --> 47:11.240\n And it's almost looks like people are excited about science.\n\n47:11.240 --> 47:16.020\n They're excited by discovery, discovery, right?\n\n47:16.020 --> 47:21.360\n And then the possibility that there's alien life that visited earth or is here on earth\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:29.040\n now is, is a excitement about discovery in your lifetime, essentially.\n\n47:29.040 --> 47:33.180\n I mean, what do you make, what do you make of that?\n\n47:33.180 --> 47:44.280\n There's recent events where DARPA or DOD released footage of these unmanned aerial phenomena.\n\n47:44.280 --> 47:46.240\n They're calling them now UAP.\n\n47:46.240 --> 47:48.160\n They got everybody like super excited.\n\n47:48.160 --> 47:52.220\n Like maybe there is like what, what, what's, what's here on earth.\n\n47:52.220 --> 47:58.880\n Do you follow the, this world of people who are thinking about aliens that are already\n\n47:58.880 --> 48:00.360\n here or have visited?\n\n48:00.360 --> 48:01.360\n I don't really follow it.\n\n48:01.360 --> 48:02.360\n They follow me.\n\n48:02.360 --> 48:11.080\n Because in this field, if you're a scientist of any kind, you get, people contact us, me.\n\n48:11.080 --> 48:15.680\n There's a lot of them about, Hey, I have stuff you should see, Hey, the aliens are already\n\n48:15.680 --> 48:16.680\n here.\n\n48:16.680 --> 48:17.680\n I need to tell you about it.\n\n48:17.680 --> 48:22.640\n And I know there are people out there who really believe there's a psychology to it.\n\n48:22.640 --> 48:25.800\n There's a psychology to it and it's fascinating, but okay.\n\n48:25.800 --> 48:29.200\n So it's similar to artificial intelligence, but I still, but like you, I'm still enamored\n\n48:29.200 --> 48:32.560\n with the point that it is out there and that people believe so strongly.\n\n48:32.560 --> 48:37.600\n And that's so many people out there believe, believe.\n\n48:37.600 --> 48:44.400\n And I don't know, I I'm not as allergic to it as some scientists are because ultimately\n\n48:44.400 --> 48:50.360\n if aliens showed up or do show up or have showed up you know, these are going to be\n\n48:50.360 --> 48:55.320\n very difficult to study scientific phenomena.\n\n48:55.320 --> 49:01.320\n Like in, in fact, like going back to cats and dogs, like I just, I think we should be\n\n49:01.320 --> 49:08.440\n more open minded about developing new tools and looking for intelligent life on earth\n\n49:08.440 --> 49:10.360\n that we haven't yet found.\n\n49:10.360 --> 49:15.160\n Or even understanding the nature of our own intelligence because it kind of is an alien\n\n49:15.160 --> 49:19.040\n life form, the thing that's living, you know, in our skull.\n\n49:19.040 --> 49:20.040\n It's so true.\n\n49:20.040 --> 49:21.040\n And we don't understand consciousness.\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:22.040\n Yeah.\n\n49:22.040 --> 49:23.040\n It's true.\n\n49:23.040 --> 49:28.480\n We don't understand how biology is hard, you know, unpacking it and working it all out.\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:29.480\n It's a stretch.\n\n49:29.480 --> 49:34.120\n And they say too that our thinking mind is like the tip of a pyramid and that everything\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:37.640\n else is happening under the hood and, but what is happening?\n\n49:37.640 --> 49:42.560\n But the thing with, so the typical scientist response to, you know, are there aliens here\n\n49:42.560 --> 49:50.000\n is that we need to see major evidence, not like a sketchy picture of something.\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:53.600\n We need some cold hard evidence and we just don't have that.\n\n49:53.600 --> 49:54.600\n That's exactly right.\n\n49:54.600 --> 49:55.600\n Yeah.\n\n49:55.600 --> 50:00.080\n But from my perspective, I admire people that dream and I think that's beautiful.\n\n50:00.080 --> 50:05.200\n The thing I don't like, there's two sides of the, of the folks that probably listened\n\n50:05.200 --> 50:12.160\n to this, this podcast is, oh, those that dream, I think is beautiful, that, that wander what's\n\n50:12.160 --> 50:14.140\n out there, what's here on earth.\n\n50:14.140 --> 50:19.520\n And then the other ones who are very conspiratorial and thinking that stuff is being hidden and\n\n50:19.520 --> 50:20.840\n it becomes about institutions.\n\n50:20.840 --> 50:21.840\n Right, right, right.\n\n50:21.840 --> 50:22.840\n Okay.\n\n50:22.840 --> 50:23.840\n I got it.\n\n50:23.840 --> 50:24.840\n I have a funny thing to talk about that.\n\n50:24.840 --> 50:28.600\n So one of my colleagues had a really good answer to that and it's not me saying this,\n\n50:28.600 --> 50:32.360\n so I can say this, but he said, look, he works with NASA, not at NASA.\n\n50:32.360 --> 50:35.140\n He works with government, not in the government.\n\n50:35.140 --> 50:37.640\n It's kind of mean, but he'd say, trust me, they couldn't hide it if they tried.\n\n50:37.640 --> 50:39.640\n Do you know what I'm saying?\n\n50:39.640 --> 50:42.360\n Like, we're not smart enough or good enough.\n\n50:42.360 --> 50:45.280\n Not we or not me or not you, but whoever to cover it up.\n\n50:45.280 --> 50:47.960\n It just, it's sort of a myth.\n\n50:47.960 --> 50:48.960\n Yeah.\n\n50:48.960 --> 50:57.040\n It makes it sad because the people at NASA, the people at MIT, the people in academia,\n\n50:57.040 --> 51:03.560\n the people in these institutions and yes, even in government are often trying, they're\n\n51:03.560 --> 51:06.280\n like just curious descendants of apes.\n\n51:06.280 --> 51:08.800\n They're just, they, they want to do good.\n\n51:08.800 --> 51:09.960\n They want to discover stuff.\n\n51:09.960 --> 51:11.480\n They're not trying to hide stuff.\n\n51:11.480 --> 51:18.520\n In fact, most of them would, in terms of leaks, would love to discover this and release this\n\n51:18.520 --> 51:19.520\n kind of stuff.\n\n51:19.520 --> 51:23.160\n There's a, did you ever watch the show called The X Files?\n\n51:23.160 --> 51:24.160\n Yeah.\n\n51:24.160 --> 51:25.160\n Scully and Mulder.\n\n51:25.160 --> 51:26.160\n Yeah.\n\n51:26.160 --> 51:29.920\n And what I love actually, I used to put it up during my talks, my public talks.\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:35.360\n There's a picture of a UFO or what looks like UFO and it says, I want to believe.\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:38.040\n So that's, that's where I think a lot of us are coming from.\n\n51:38.040 --> 51:40.400\n I want to believe.\n\n51:40.400 --> 51:41.400\n And it's so great.\n\n51:41.400 --> 51:46.040\n And one time I put that up and this very, very nice couple approached me really nervous\n\n51:46.040 --> 51:49.720\n afterwards and they said, Hey, can we take you out for lunch sometime?\n\n51:49.720 --> 51:50.720\n And I said, sure.\n\n51:50.720 --> 51:52.740\n And they were like the nicest people.\n\n51:52.740 --> 51:59.000\n And just one of many who has an alien, alien abduction story and the woman, um, could never\n\n51:59.000 --> 52:00.000\n have kids.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:02.980\n They were older, but they didn't have kids, which for them was a real source of regret.\n\n52:02.980 --> 52:06.560\n But it was because the aliens who had abducted her had made it so that she couldn't have\n\n52:06.560 --> 52:07.560\n kids.\n\n52:07.560 --> 52:12.280\n And she had apparently something implanted behind her ear, which was somehow unimplanted\n\n52:12.280 --> 52:13.280\n later.\n\n52:13.280 --> 52:18.480\n And they're just so sincere and they're such a lovely couple and they just wanted to share\n\n52:18.480 --> 52:19.480\n their story.\n\n52:19.480 --> 52:23.640\n That's a, that's a real, whatever that is, that's the real thing.\n\n52:23.640 --> 52:30.720\n The mystery of the human mind is more powerful than any alien or, I mean, it's as interesting\n\n52:30.720 --> 52:32.000\n I think as the universe.\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:38.840\n And I think they're somehow intricately linked, maybe getting a sense of numbers.\n\n52:38.840 --> 52:46.880\n How many stars are there in, um, maybe, I don't know what the radius that's reasonable\n\n52:46.880 --> 52:47.880\n to think about.\n\n52:47.880 --> 52:52.360\n I don't know if the observable universe is like way too big to think about, but in terms\n\n52:52.360 --> 52:56.600\n of when we think about how many habitable planets there are, what are the numbers we're\n\n52:56.600 --> 52:58.960\n working with in your sense?\n\n52:58.960 --> 52:59.960\n What are the scale?\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:03.760\n Honestly, the numbers are probably like billions of trillions of stars.\n\n53:03.760 --> 53:04.760\n Yeah.\n\n53:04.760 --> 53:07.720\n You know, in the UK, I think, I don't know if we do that here, but they will call a billion\n\n53:07.720 --> 53:10.880\n trillion where you put like one billion followed by a trillion.\n\n53:10.880 --> 53:11.880\n Yeah.\n\n53:11.880 --> 53:14.960\n It's kind of weird, but here, I don't even know how to say the number 10 to the 20.\n\n53:14.960 --> 53:17.600\n Like if you know what that is, that's one followed by 20 zeros.\n\n53:17.600 --> 53:18.600\n That's a big number.\n\n53:18.600 --> 53:20.220\n We don't have a name for that number.\n\n53:20.220 --> 53:22.640\n There's so many per star.\n\n53:22.640 --> 53:23.840\n I think we kind of mentioned this.\n\n53:23.840 --> 53:30.320\n Is there a good sense, there's probably argument about this, but per star, how many planets\n\n53:30.320 --> 53:31.320\n are there?\n\n53:31.320 --> 53:35.640\n We don't have that number yet per se, you know, we're not really there, but some people\n\n53:35.640 --> 53:38.240\n think that there's many planets per star.\n\n53:38.240 --> 53:43.840\n There's this analogy of filling the coffee cup, like, you know, you don't usually just\n\n53:43.840 --> 53:45.360\n pour one drop, you fill it.\n\n53:45.360 --> 53:51.160\n And that planetary systems, we see stars being born that have a disc of gas and dust and\n\n53:51.160 --> 53:53.280\n that ultimately forms planets.\n\n53:53.280 --> 53:58.940\n So the idea, this kind of concept is that planets, so many planets form too many.\n\n53:58.940 --> 54:02.680\n And eventually some get kicked out and you're left with like a full planetary system, a\n\n54:02.680 --> 54:04.000\n dynamically full system.\n\n54:04.000 --> 54:08.080\n And so there have to be a lot because so many form and a bunch survive.\n\n54:08.080 --> 54:11.080\n I mean, that makes perfect intuitive sense, right?\n\n54:11.080 --> 54:12.880\n Like why wouldn't that happen?\n\n54:12.880 --> 54:13.880\n Right.\n\n54:13.880 --> 54:16.340\n Well, there's other thoughts too, though.\n\n54:16.340 --> 54:20.720\n These big planets that are really close to the star, we think they formed far away from\n\n54:20.720 --> 54:25.220\n the star where there's enough material to form and they migrated inwards.\n\n54:25.220 --> 54:28.600\n And some of these planets migrating inwards due to interaction with other planets or with\n\n54:28.600 --> 54:32.120\n the disc itself, they may have cleared it out.\n\n54:32.120 --> 54:34.700\n And kicked other planets out of the system.\n\n54:34.700 --> 54:36.540\n So there's a lot of ideas floating around.\n\n54:36.540 --> 54:39.120\n We're not entirely sure.\n\n54:39.120 --> 54:41.440\n And what about Earth like planets?\n\n54:41.440 --> 54:43.680\n That's another level of uncertainty.\n\n54:43.680 --> 54:44.760\n It's a level of uncertainty.\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:51.440\n If we think of an Earth like planet being an Earth around a sun in the same orbit, an\n\n54:51.440 --> 54:55.800\n Earth like planet being an Earth sized planet in an Earth like orbit about a sun like star,\n\n54:55.800 --> 54:56.800\n we're not there yet.\n\n54:56.800 --> 55:00.760\n You know, we're not able to detect enough of those to give you a hard number.\n\n55:00.760 --> 55:03.080\n Some people have extrapolated.\n\n55:03.080 --> 55:08.560\n And they will say as many as one in five stars like our sun could be hosting a true Earth\n\n55:08.560 --> 55:09.560\n like planet.\n\n55:09.560 --> 55:10.560\n Wow.\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:15.280\n On the topic of space exploration, there's been a lot of exciting developments with NASA,\n\n55:15.280 --> 55:23.680\n with SpaceX, with other companies successfully getting rockets into space with humans and\n\n55:23.680 --> 55:27.920\n getting them to land back, especially with SpaceX.\n\n55:27.920 --> 55:33.920\n What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX, Crew Dragon, while working with NASA\n\n55:33.920 --> 55:35.680\n to launch astronauts?\n\n55:35.680 --> 55:39.720\n What's your sense about these exciting new developments?\n\n55:39.720 --> 55:46.200\n Well, SpaceX and other so called commercial companies are only good news for my field,\n\n55:46.200 --> 55:50.600\n because they're lowering the cost of getting to space by having reusable rockets.\n\n55:50.600 --> 55:52.200\n It's just been it's incredible.\n\n55:52.200 --> 55:53.840\n And we need cheaper access to space.\n\n55:53.840 --> 55:56.760\n So from a very practical viewpoint, it's all good.\n\n55:56.760 --> 56:01.520\n Without getting people, there's this dream that we have to go to Mars, boots on Mars.\n\n56:01.520 --> 56:03.960\n Boots on Mars.\n\n56:03.960 --> 56:04.960\n What do you think about that?\n\n56:04.960 --> 56:06.080\n You mentioned probes.\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:08.560\n What's the value of humans?\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:13.880\n Is that interesting to you from both scientific and a human perspective?\n\n56:13.880 --> 56:14.880\n Human mostly.\n\n56:14.880 --> 56:19.400\n I think it's such in our desire to explore because part of what it means to be human.\n\n56:19.400 --> 56:23.440\n So wanting to go to another planet and be able to live there for some time.\n\n56:23.440 --> 56:26.520\n It's just just what it means to be human.\n\n56:26.520 --> 56:32.160\n You know, oftentimes in science and engineering, big, huge discoveries are made when we didn't\n\n56:32.160 --> 56:33.680\n intend to.\n\n56:33.680 --> 56:37.720\n So often this kind of pure exploratory type of research or this pure exploration research,\n\n56:37.720 --> 56:41.060\n it can lead to something really important like the laser, we couldn't really live without\n\n56:41.060 --> 56:42.060\n that now.\n\n56:42.060 --> 56:46.860\n At the grocery, you scan your foods, there's surgery that involves lasers, GPS, we all\n\n56:46.860 --> 56:47.860\n use our GPS.\n\n56:47.860 --> 56:53.120\n We don't have GPS because someone thought, hey, it'd be great to have a navigation system.\n\n56:53.120 --> 56:58.480\n And so I do support, I do, I just, but I really think it comes primarily just from the desire\n\n56:58.480 --> 56:59.480\n to explore.\n\n56:59.480 --> 57:06.380\n Do you think something, there's a lot of criticism and a lot of excitement about Mars.\n\n57:06.380 --> 57:12.880\n Do you think there's value in trying to go to put humans on Mars, first of all, and second\n\n57:12.880 --> 57:15.680\n of all, colonize Mars?\n\n57:15.680 --> 57:18.920\n Do you think there's something interesting that might come from there?\n\n57:18.920 --> 57:20.680\n I'm convinced there will be something interesting.\n\n57:20.680 --> 57:24.880\n I just don't know what it is yet, but I don't think, I don't think having some commercial\n\n57:24.880 --> 57:29.480\n value or value in the metric of something useful is really what's motivating us.\n\n57:29.480 --> 57:33.640\n So really, you see, exploration is a long term investment into something awesome that\n\n57:33.640 --> 57:35.560\n eventually will be commercial value.\n\n57:35.560 --> 57:36.560\n I do actually.\n\n57:36.560 --> 57:37.560\n Yeah.\n\n57:37.560 --> 57:38.560\n I do.\n\n57:38.560 --> 57:48.640\n So what about visiting, okay, I apologize, but Amy, there's an exciting longing to visit\n\n57:48.640 --> 57:51.140\n Earth like planets elsewhere.\n\n57:51.140 --> 57:59.200\n So what's the closest Earth like planet you think is worth visiting and how hard is it?\n\n57:59.200 --> 58:01.560\n Wow, it is very hard.\n\n58:01.560 --> 58:05.640\n I mean, our nearest, call it Earth mass planet, it's orbiting a star very different from\n\n58:05.640 --> 58:10.460\n our own sun, an M Dwarf star, a small red star, Proxima Centauri.\n\n58:10.460 --> 58:15.340\n It's over four light years away and we can't travel at the speed of light.\n\n58:15.340 --> 58:18.640\n We can't even travel, I mean, it would take tens of thousands of years to get there with\n\n58:18.640 --> 58:19.640\n conventional methods.\n\n58:19.640 --> 58:23.920\n So, you know, the movies like multigenerational, yeah, this movie Passenger, have you seen\n\n58:23.920 --> 58:24.920\n that movie?\n\n58:24.920 --> 58:25.920\n Passenger.\n\n58:25.920 --> 58:26.920\n No.\n\n58:26.920 --> 58:30.400\n It's about a big spaceship that is traveling to another planet and everyone's hibernating.\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:33.320\n I won't give you the spoiler alert because one person wakes up and then it's kind of\n\n58:33.320 --> 58:34.320\n a problem.\n\n58:34.320 --> 58:35.320\n Okay, got it.\n\n58:35.320 --> 58:40.940\n But yeah, the multigenerational ships, I mean, when you think about where we're headed as\n\n58:40.940 --> 58:48.200\n a species, maybe we don't send people, maybe we end up sending raw biological materials\n\n58:48.200 --> 58:54.640\n and instructions to print out humans, it sounds kind of farfetched, but already we're printing\n\n58:54.640 --> 59:01.360\n like liver cells in the lab and beating heart cells, we're starting to reconstruct body\n\n59:01.360 --> 59:02.360\n parts.\n\n59:02.360 --> 59:06.080\n I mean, the thing is, it is so hard to get to another planet that this thought of printing\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:09.080\n humans or printing life forms actually could be easier.\n\n59:09.080 --> 59:16.680\n Yeah, that's somehow so sad to think, to think of the idea that we would launch a successful\n\n59:16.680 --> 59:23.520\n spaceship that has multigenerational, like non human life and it's going to reach other\n\n59:23.520 --> 59:30.120\n intelligent life and by the time they figure out where it came from, human civilization\n\n59:30.120 --> 59:31.120\n will be extinct.\n\n59:31.120 --> 59:32.120\n Wow.\n\n59:32.120 --> 59:36.480\n Yeah, that is really, I mean, that's, so that's one, there's a, there's a tempting thing to\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:37.480\n think about.\n\n59:37.480 --> 59:38.480\n What are the possible trajectories?\n\n59:38.480 --> 59:47.040\n So, you know, Elon keeps talking about multi planetary, us becoming multi planetary species.\n\n59:47.040 --> 59:55.000\n I mean, sure, Mars is a part of that, but like the dream is to really expand outside\n\n59:55.000 --> 59:57.080\n the solar system.\n\n59:57.080 --> 1:00:02.240\n And it's, it's not clear, just like, as you said, like what the actual scientific engineering\n\n1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:08.420\n steps that are required to take, it seems like so daunting, so daunting.\n\n1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:15.360\n So like this, the smart thing seems to be to do the most achievable near daunting task,\n\n1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:20.680\n even if there doesn't seem to be a commercial application, which I think is colonizing\n\n1:00:20.680 --> 1:00:21.680\n Mars.\n\n1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:30.600\n But like from your perspective, is there some Manhattan project style, huge project in space\n\n1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:34.920\n that we might want to take on and you've had roles.\n\n1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:39.600\n You had scientists hat roles and then you also had roles in terms of being on like committees\n\n1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:42.680\n and stuff, determining where funding goes and so on.\n\n1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:48.840\n So like, is there a huge like multi trillion, we've been throwing the T word around recently\n\n1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:52.200\n a lot, but these huge projects that we might want to take on?\n\n1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:56.220\n Well, first of all, we want to find the planets like earth first, like just even finding those\n\n1:00:56.220 --> 1:01:01.200\n earth like planets is a billion dollar endeavor, billions of dollars endeavor.\n\n1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:06.560\n And that's so hard because an earth is so small, so less massive, and so faint compared\n\n1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.100\n to our sun.\n\n1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:10.920\n It's the proverbial needle in a haystack, but worse.\n\n1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:15.560\n And we need very sophisticated space based telescopes to be able to find these planets\n\n1:01:15.560 --> 1:01:19.800\n and to look, look at them and see which ones have water and which ones have signs of life\n\n1:01:19.800 --> 1:01:20.800\n on them.\n\n1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:24.720\n Yeah, the, the star shade project that you're part of, star shade, star shade, yeah, this\n\n1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:26.680\n is probably the most badass thing I've ever seen.\n\n1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:27.680\n Right.\n\n1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:28.680\n You know what's interesting?\n\n1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:29.680\n Can you describe what it is?\n\n1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:34.920\n So what's amazing about star shade is it was first conceived of in the 1960s.\n\n1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:38.640\n Imagine that and revisited every decade until now when we think we can actually build it\n\n1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.880\n and star shade is a giant specially shaped screen.\n\n1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:47.120\n It is about, there's different versions of it, but think about 30 meters in diameter.\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:49.700\n So you're blocking out the sun.\n\n1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:54.240\n You're effectively blocking out the star so that you can see the planet directly and star\n\n1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:58.800\n shade would have a spacecraft attached to it and it would fly in space far away from\n\n1:01:58.800 --> 1:02:03.660\n Earth's gravity and it would have to formation fly with a space telescope.\n\n1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:08.200\n So the idea is that star shade blocks out the starlight in a very careful way and it\n\n1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:13.360\n has to block that starlight out so that the planet that is 10 billion times fainter than\n\n1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:17.640\n the star, that only the planet light goes to the telescope.\n\n1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:19.020 --> 1:02:24.840\n So in formation, meaning the telescope flies in, you gave a presentation on this, but like\n\n1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:30.960\n it, it would fly like in, um, this is extremely high precision endeavor.\n\n1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:31.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:37.040\n We had this analogy like asking a friend to hold up a dime five miles away perfectly.\n\n1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:40.460\n Like at the perfect line of sight with you.\n\n1:02:40.460 --> 1:02:41.720\n And the shape of it is pretty cool.\n\n1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:45.780\n I mean, uh, I don't know exactly what the physics of that, like what the optics are\n\n1:02:45.780 --> 1:02:47.240\n that require that shape.\n\n1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:51.280\n I can tell you, it turns out that if you block out a star, imagine blocking out a star with\n\n1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:57.240\n a circle circularly or a square shaped screen, you wouldn't actually be blocking it because\n\n1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.840\n the star acts like a wave.\n\n1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:03.840\n The starlight can act like a wave and it would actually bend around the edges of the screen.\n\n1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:06.360\n And so instead of blocking out the light, you're expecting to see nothing.\n\n1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:11.120\n You would see ripples and the analogy that I love to give, it's like throwing a pebble\n\n1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:12.120\n in a pond.\n\n1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:16.480\n You know, you get those ripples, you get these concentric ripples and they go out and light\n\n1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:18.640\n would do something quite similar.\n\n1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:23.800\n You'd actually see ripples of light and those ripples of light, they're actually way brighter\n\n1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:26.380\n than the planet we'd be looking for.\n\n1:03:26.380 --> 1:03:29.360\n So they would introduce this noise that's a noise.\n\n1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:33.900\n And so the star shade, it's like a mathematical solution to the problem of diffraction it's\n\n1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:35.240\n called.\n\n1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:39.820\n And this is what the first person who thought about star shape in the 1960s worked out the\n\n1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:43.860\n mathematical shape or one salute, one family of solutions.\n\n1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:48.320\n And the idea is that when the star shade, this very special shape, like a giant flower\n\n1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:53.680\n with petals, when it blocks out the light, the light bends around the edges, but interacts\n\n1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.220\n with itself in a way to give you a very, very dark image.\n\n1:03:57.220 --> 1:04:02.240\n It would be like throwing a pebble in a pond and instead of getting ripples, the pond would\n\n1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:06.760\n be perfectly smooth, like incredibly smooth to one part in 10 billion.\n\n1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:11.980\n And all the waves would be on the outer edges, far away from where you drop that pebble.\n\n1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:19.640\n And so this camera would be able to get some signal from the planet then.\n\n1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:22.020\n Yes, and it would be hard because the planet is so faint.\n\n1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:25.840\n But with the star out of the way, the glare of that bright, bright, bright star, with\n\n1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:30.500\n that out of the way, then it becomes a much more manageable task.\n\n1:04:30.500 --> 1:04:32.520\n So how do we get that thing out there?\n\n1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.040\n We're working with unlimited money.\n\n1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:35.800\n Okay, we're working with unlimited money.\n\n1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:39.160\n We have some more engineering problems to solve, but not too many more.\n\n1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.000\n We've been burning down our so called tall pole list.\n\n1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000\n What kind of list?\n\n1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.360\n We call it technology tall pole.\n\n1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:51.860\n It's the phrase where you have to figure out what are your hardest problems and then break\n\n1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.080\n those down to solve.\n\n1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:57.760\n So the star shade, one of the really hard problems was how to formation fly at tens\n\n1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:59.800\n of thousands of kilometers.\n\n1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:02.120\n It's like, wow, that is insane.\n\n1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:06.760\n And the team broke that down actually into a sensing problem because of the star shade.\n\n1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:10.200\n How do you see the star shade precisely enough to control it?\n\n1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:13.720\n Because if you're shining a flashlight, you know the beam spreads out.\n\n1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:17.800\n So the star shade has a beacon, an LED or a laser, it's going to spread out so much\n\n1:05:17.800 --> 1:05:19.940\n by the time it gets to the telescope.\n\n1:05:19.940 --> 1:05:23.240\n The problem wasn't how do you tell the star shade how to move around fast enough to stay\n\n1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:24.560\n in a straight line.\n\n1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:27.720\n The problem was how are you able to sense it well enough?\n\n1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:32.540\n So problems like that were broken down and money that came from NASA to solve problems\n\n1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:34.460\n is put towards solving it.\n\n1:05:34.460 --> 1:05:37.020\n So we've got through most of the hard problems right now.\n\n1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:41.500\n Another one was that star shade, even though it's looking at a star, light from our own\n\n1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:46.880\n sun could hit the edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescope, believe\n\n1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:48.720\n it or not.\n\n1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:52.960\n And that would actually ruin it because we're trying to see this tiny, tiny signal.\n\n1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:55.760\n So then the question is how do you make a razor thin edge?\n\n1:05:55.760 --> 1:05:58.640\n Those pedal edges would have to be like a razor.\n\n1:05:58.640 --> 1:05:59.640\n What materials can you use?\n\n1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:01.640\n So there's a series of problems like that.\n\n1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:02.640\n Wow.\n\n1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:03.880\n So there's a materials problem in there?\n\n1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:04.880\n Some of them.\n\n1:06:04.880 --> 1:06:05.880\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:06.880\n Wow.\n\n1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:07.880\n And there's one.\n\n1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:12.820\n So we almost finished solving all those problems and then it's just a matter of building one\n\n1:06:12.820 --> 1:06:18.060\n and testing it in a full scale size facility and then building the telescope.\n\n1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:22.220\n It's just a matter of time to build everything and get it, get it up for launch.\n\n1:06:22.220 --> 1:06:26.520\n So this is an engineering close engineering project.\n\n1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.240\n It's a real engineering project.\n\n1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:32.320\n I actually can tell you about two other projects that are not mine.\n\n1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:38.900\n I like to call, call star shade mine because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream\n\n1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:40.840\n without line is constantly shifting.\n\n1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:44.480\n When I started, when I got this leadership role on star shade, I remember telling people\n\n1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.860\n about it and it was definitely not on the mainstream okay line.\n\n1:06:47.860 --> 1:06:52.420\n It was on the giggle factor side of the line and people would just laugh like that's dead.\n\n1:06:52.420 --> 1:06:55.800\n Like you can never formation fly or they'd say, why are you working on that?\n\n1:06:55.800 --> 1:06:58.280\n That's just so not, it's not so awesome.\n\n1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:01.820\n There's a, there's a few things you've done in your life and that's when I first saw star\n\n1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:04.700\n shade, I was like, what, really?\n\n1:07:04.700 --> 1:07:07.060\n And then like it sinks in.\n\n1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:11.940\n I mean, it's the same thing I felt with like Elon Musk or certain people who do crazy stuff\n\n1:07:11.940 --> 1:07:15.820\n and like, and then, and they get, they actually make it work.\n\n1:07:15.820 --> 1:07:22.860\n I mean, if you get star shade information flying to like together, I mean, how awesome\n\n1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:27.520\n is that if you actually make that happen, even like from a robot, I'm sorry, from the\n\n1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:31.600\n robotics perspective, even if it doesn't give us good data, that's just like a cool\n\n1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:33.180\n thing to get out there.\n\n1:07:33.180 --> 1:07:34.600\n I mean, it's really exciting.\n\n1:07:34.600 --> 1:07:35.600\n Really cool.\n\n1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:39.340\n So there's two other topics that aren't mine, but I still love them.\n\n1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:43.160\n One of them, let's just talk about it briefly because it's not a probe, but it's the idea\n\n1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.820\n to send a telescope very far away to 500 times the earth sun distance.\n\n1:07:47.820 --> 1:07:51.160\n And this is way farther than the Voyager spacecrafts are right now.\n\n1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:56.740\n And to use our sun as a gravitational lens, to use our sun to magnify something that's\n\n1:07:56.740 --> 1:07:59.200\n behind it.\n\n1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.980\n It's got to sink in for a minute.\n\n1:08:00.980 --> 1:08:01.980\n Exactly.\n\n1:08:01.980 --> 1:08:05.400\n But I mean, I don't know what the physics of that is, like how to use the sun.\n\n1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:11.000\n In astronomy, and Einstein thought about this initially, we can use a massive objects, bend\n\n1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.120\n space.\n\n1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:16.900\n And so light that should be traveling like straight, it actually travels around the warped\n\n1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:18.440\n space.\n\n1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:23.060\n And somehow you figure out a way to use that for magnification.\n\n1:08:23.060 --> 1:08:25.220\n You have a way to use that for magnification.\n\n1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:26.220\n That's right.\n\n1:08:26.220 --> 1:08:33.060\n There are galaxies that are lensed, so called gravitational lens by intervening galaxy clusters\n\n1:08:33.060 --> 1:08:34.660\n actually.\n\n1:08:34.660 --> 1:08:40.740\n And there are microlensing events where stars get magnified as an unseen gravitational lens\n\n1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:43.600\n star passes in between us and that very distant star.\n\n1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:45.540\n It's actually a real tool in astronomy.\n\n1:08:45.540 --> 1:08:49.940\n Yeah, using gravitational lensing to magnify because it bends more rays towards you than\n\n1:08:49.940 --> 1:08:52.060\n normally you'd normally see.\n\n1:08:52.060 --> 1:08:58.740\n And again, we're trying to get more higher resolution images that are basically boiled\n\n1:08:58.740 --> 1:08:59.740\n down to light.\n\n1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:01.700\n Well, it boils down to light.\n\n1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:04.780\n And then you can maybe get more information about.\n\n1:09:04.780 --> 1:09:10.500\n Well, in this case, you would ask me, let's say, if this thing could get built, it would\n\n1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:15.780\n take like something like they like to say 25 years to get from here to there, 25 years\n\n1:09:15.780 --> 1:09:18.300\n and then it could send some information back to us.\n\n1:09:18.300 --> 1:09:20.540\n And then you'd say, so Sarah, how many pixels?\n\n1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:21.900\n And I wouldn't say one or less than one.\n\n1:09:21.900 --> 1:09:26.300\n I'd say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels, it could be 100 pixels, which would\n\n1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:27.300\n be awesome.\n\n1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:30.500\n I mean, that's still crazy that we can get a lot of information from that.\n\n1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.500\n Crazy, right.\n\n1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:34.340\n And it's crazy for a lot of other reasons, because again, you have to line up the sun\n\n1:09:34.340 --> 1:09:35.340\n and your target.\n\n1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:39.980\n You'd only have one telescope per target, because every star is behind the sun in a\n\n1:09:39.980 --> 1:09:42.460\n different way.\n\n1:09:42.460 --> 1:09:43.980\n So it's a lot of complicated things.\n\n1:09:43.980 --> 1:09:44.980\n What about the second?\n\n1:09:44.980 --> 1:09:48.580\n The second one, it's called star shot.\n\n1:09:48.580 --> 1:09:53.540\n You know, star shot means like big dreams and it's an initiative by the Breakthrough\n\n1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:55.740\n Foundation.\n\n1:09:55.740 --> 1:10:02.700\n And star shot is the concept to send thousands of little tiny spacecraft, which they now\n\n1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:03.700\n call star chip.\n\n1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:06.580\n So instead of star ship, it's star chip.\n\n1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:13.520\n And there's a little chip and the star chip, so like sending like thousands of little turtles\n\n1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:15.100\n being born, they're not all going to make it.\n\n1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:20.700\n The idea is to send lots of them, and each of these star chips, once they're launched\n\n1:10:20.700 --> 1:10:26.420\n into, I guess, low Earth orbit, they will deploy a solar sail that's a few meters in\n\n1:10:26.420 --> 1:10:27.940\n diameter.\n\n1:10:27.940 --> 1:10:34.040\n And the idea is that on Earth, we would have a bank of, this one is still a bit on the\n\n1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:40.420\n other side of the line, but we'd have a bank of telescopes with lasers that would be like\n\n1:10:40.420 --> 1:10:48.660\n a gigawatt power and these lasers would momentarily shine upwards and accelerate, they'd hit these\n\n1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:49.660\n sails.\n\n1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:54.500\n They'd be like a power source for the sail and would accelerate the sails to travel at\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:57.700\n about a 20th the speed of light.\n\n1:10:57.700 --> 1:10:59.940\n Is that as crazy as it sounds?\n\n1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:05.720\n Well, like any good engineering project, it has to be broken down into the crazy parts.\n\n1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:11.500\n And the Breakthrough Initiative, like to their huge credit, is sponsoring, you know, getting\n\n1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:16.260\n over these, actually, they've listed initially, they listed 19 challenges, so it's broken\n\n1:11:16.260 --> 1:11:17.940\n down to concrete things.\n\n1:11:17.940 --> 1:11:21.340\n Like one of them is, well, you have to buy the land and make sure the airspace is okay\n\n1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:24.980\n with you sending up that much power overhead.\n\n1:11:24.980 --> 1:11:29.100\n Another one is you have to have material on the sail where the lasers won't just vaporize\n\n1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:30.100\n it.\n\n1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:33.580\n So there's a lot of issues, but anyway, these sails would be accelerated to 20th the speed\n\n1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:38.460\n of light and their journey to the nearest star would no longer be tens of thousands\n\n1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:45.860\n of years, but could be 20 years, okay, 20, so it's not as bad as tens of thousands.\n\n1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:52.060\n And these thousands or whatever, however many make it, they'll go by the nearest star system\n\n1:11:52.060 --> 1:11:57.220\n and snap some images and radio the information back to Earth because they're traveling so\n\n1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:01.340\n fast they can't slow down, but they'll zoom by, take some photos, send it back.\n\n1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:02.340\n Hi, Rez.\n\n1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:06.180\n See, just what I want you to pause on for a second is that just by making that a real\n\n1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:11.220\n concept and the money given won't make it happen, but what it's done is it's planted\n\n1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:15.980\n the seed and it's shifted that line from what is crazy to what is a real project.\n\n1:12:15.980 --> 1:12:20.020\n It's shifted it just ever so slightly enough, I think, to plant the seed that we have to\n\n1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:23.300\n find a way to somehow find a way to get there.\n\n1:12:23.300 --> 1:12:26.380\n That is, again, to stay on that, that is so powerful.\n\n1:12:26.380 --> 1:12:34.620\n Make a big, crazy idea and break it down into smaller, crazy ideas, order it in a list,\n\n1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:38.820\n and knock it out one at a time.\n\n1:12:38.820 --> 1:12:43.260\n I don't know, I've never heard anything more inspiring from an engineering perspective\n\n1:12:43.260 --> 1:12:46.060\n because that's how you solve the impossible things.\n\n1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:55.300\n So you open your new book discussing Rogue Planet, PSO, J318, I never said this out loud,\n\n1:12:55.300 --> 1:13:03.180\n PSO 1.522, so a Rogue Planet, which is just this poetic, beautiful vision of a planet\n\n1:13:03.180 --> 1:13:10.780\n that, as you write, lurches across the galaxy like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual\n\n1:13:10.780 --> 1:13:18.500\n darkness, its surface swept by constant storms, its black skies raining molten iron.\n\n1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:27.340\n Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness, just how not pleasant it is for\n\n1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:32.900\n human life, just the intensity of that metaphor, I don't know.\n\n1:13:32.900 --> 1:13:43.700\n And the reason you use that is to paint in a feeling of loneliness, I think, and despair.\n\n1:13:43.700 --> 1:13:53.860\n And why, maybe on the planet side, why does it feel, maybe it's just me, why does it feel\n\n1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:57.860\n so profoundly lonely on that kind of planet?\n\n1:13:57.860 --> 1:13:59.420\n Like what...\n\n1:13:59.420 --> 1:14:06.260\n I think it's because we all want to be a part of something, a part of a family, or a part\n\n1:14:06.260 --> 1:14:10.540\n of a community, or a part of something.\n\n1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:16.980\n And so, our solar system, and by the way, I only, it's sort of like when you treat yourself\n\n1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:21.980\n to like eating an entire tub of ice cream, like I sometimes treat myself to imagine things\n\n1:14:21.980 --> 1:14:25.140\n like this and not just be so cut and dried.\n\n1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:28.380\n But when you imagine that, this planet's not part, because I don't want to give emotions\n\n1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:31.460\n to a planet per se, but the planet's not part of anything.\n\n1:14:31.460 --> 1:14:37.140\n It's somehow, it's just all on its own, just kind of out there without that warm energy\n\n1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:40.980\n from its sun, it's just all alone out there.\n\n1:14:40.980 --> 1:14:45.980\n To me, it was this little discovery that I actually feel pretty good being part of this\n\n1:14:45.980 --> 1:14:47.580\n solar system.\n\n1:14:47.580 --> 1:14:52.540\n It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family, and it felt like it sucked\n\n1:14:52.540 --> 1:14:59.900\n for the rogue planet to just floating about, not floating, flying rudderless.\n\n1:14:59.900 --> 1:15:04.620\n By the way, how many rogue planets are there in your sense?\n\n1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:05.620\n We don't know totally.\n\n1:15:05.620 --> 1:15:08.540\n I mean, there's some rogue planets that are just born on their own.\n\n1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:11.900\n I know that sounds really weird to be, how can you be born an orphan?\n\n1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:17.660\n But they just are, because most planets are born out of a disc of gas and dust around\n\n1:15:17.660 --> 1:15:18.660\n a star.\n\n1:15:18.660 --> 1:15:21.580\n But some of these small planets are like totally failed stars.\n\n1:15:21.580 --> 1:15:24.580\n They're so failed, they're just small planets on their own.\n\n1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:29.060\n But we think that there's probably, honestly, there's another path to a rogue planet.\n\n1:15:29.060 --> 1:15:33.060\n That's one that's been kicked out of its star system by other planets, like a game of billiard\n\n1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:34.060\n balls.\n\n1:15:34.060 --> 1:15:35.660\n It just gets kicked out.\n\n1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:39.780\n We actually think there's probably as many rogue planets as stars.\n\n1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:44.620\n No flying out there, fundamentally alone.\n\n1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:56.740\n So the book is a memoir, is about your life, and it weaves both your fascination with planets\n\n1:15:56.740 --> 1:16:05.780\n outside the solar system and the path of your life, and you lost your husband, which is\n\n1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:15.620\n a kind of central part of the book that created a feeling of the rogue planet.\n\n1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:17.380\n By the way, what's the name of the book?\n\n1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:21.740\n The name of the book is The Smallest Lights in the Universe.\n\n1:16:21.740 --> 1:16:22.740\n What's up with the title?\n\n1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:23.740\n What's the meaning?\n\n1:16:23.740 --> 1:16:25.100\n The title has a double meaning.\n\n1:16:25.100 --> 1:16:27.700\n On the face of it, it's the search for other Earths.\n\n1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:32.900\n Earths are so dim compared to the big, bright, massive star beside them.\n\n1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:38.700\n Searching for the Earths is like searching for the smallest lights in the universe.\n\n1:16:38.700 --> 1:16:42.300\n It has this other meaning, too.\n\n1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:49.060\n I really hope that you or the other people listening never get to the place where you've\n\n1:16:49.060 --> 1:16:56.500\n fallen off the cliff into this horrible place of huge despair.\n\n1:16:56.500 --> 1:17:01.060\n And once in a while, you get a glimmer of a better life, of some kind of hope.\n\n1:17:01.060 --> 1:17:03.420\n And those are also the smallest lights in the universe.\n\n1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:11.720\n Well, maybe we can tell the full story before we talk about the glimmer of hope.\n\n1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:17.620\n What did it feel like to first find out that your husband, Mike, was sick?\n\n1:17:17.620 --> 1:17:19.540\n It was incredibly frustrating.\n\n1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:25.100\n Like, lots of us have had some kind of problem that the doctors completely ignore.\n\n1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:27.340\n Just that they kept blowing him off.\n\n1:17:27.340 --> 1:17:28.340\n It's nothing.\n\n1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:30.740\n Are they paid to just say it's nothing?\n\n1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:32.060\n I mean, it's just insane.\n\n1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:34.580\n I was just so angry.\n\n1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:37.140\n And we finally got to a point where he was really sick.\n\n1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:41.680\n He was like in bed, not able to move, basically.\n\n1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:47.460\n And it turned out all the things they ignored and not done any tests, he had like a 100%\n\n1:17:47.460 --> 1:17:48.940\n blockage in his intestine.\n\n1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:49.940\n Like 100%.\n\n1:17:49.940 --> 1:17:53.900\n Like nothing could get out, nothing could get in.\n\n1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:58.580\n And it was pretty, pretty shocking to even hear then that it could be nothing.\n\n1:17:58.580 --> 1:18:03.140\n What was the progression of it in the context of the maybe the medical system, the doctors?\n\n1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:05.340\n I mean, what did it feel like?\n\n1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:08.940\n Did you feel like a human being?\n\n1:18:08.940 --> 1:18:11.180\n I felt like a child.\n\n1:18:11.180 --> 1:18:19.260\n Like the doctors were trying to water down the real diagnosis or treat us like we couldn't\n\n1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:21.060\n know the truth or they didn't know.\n\n1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:24.920\n You know, I felt mixed like, it's not a good situation if you think the doctor either has\n\n1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.780\n no idea what he or she is doing, or if the doctors purposely, let's just say lying to\n\n1:18:29.780 --> 1:18:30.780\n you to sugarcoat it.\n\n1:18:30.780 --> 1:18:34.140\n Like, I didn't know which one of it was, but I knew it was one of those.\n\n1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:37.660\n What were the things he was suffering from?\n\n1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:39.860\n Well, initially, he just had a random stomach ache.\n\n1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:43.380\n I hate to say that out loud because I know a lot of people will have a random stomach\n\n1:18:43.380 --> 1:18:44.380\n ache.\n\n1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:47.420\n But so he just had a bad stomach ache and then, hmm, this is weird.\n\n1:18:47.420 --> 1:18:50.420\n A few days later, another bad stomach ache, kind of gets worse.\n\n1:18:50.420 --> 1:18:52.940\n Might go away for a few weeks, might come back.\n\n1:18:52.940 --> 1:18:56.700\n And at the time, all I knew was my dad had had that same thing.\n\n1:18:56.700 --> 1:19:01.820\n Not the same identical system, but he had these really weird pains and he ended up having\n\n1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:03.620\n the worst diagnosis.\n\n1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:07.900\n One of the worst diagnoses you can get from a random stomach ache is pancreatic cancer\n\n1:19:07.900 --> 1:19:12.380\n because the time, the pancreas, like you can't feel anything, so by the time you feel pain,\n\n1:19:12.380 --> 1:19:13.380\n it's too late.\n\n1:19:13.380 --> 1:19:14.380\n It's spread already.\n\n1:19:14.380 --> 1:19:19.220\n So I was just like, beside myself, I'm like, this is like, wow, this guy, he's got a random\n\n1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:20.220\n stomach ache.\n\n1:19:20.220 --> 1:19:24.100\n All I know is another man I loved had a random stomach ache and it didn't end well.\n\n1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:30.380\n How did you deal with it emotionally, psychologically, intellectually, as a scientist?\n\n1:19:30.380 --> 1:19:34.060\n What was that like, that whole, because it's not immediate.\n\n1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:35.060\n It's a long journey.\n\n1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:38.960\n It's a long journey and you don't know where the diagnosis is going.\n\n1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:44.120\n So anyone who's suffered from a major illness, there's like always branches in the road.\n\n1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.140\n So he had this intestinal blockage.\n\n1:19:47.140 --> 1:19:50.660\n I can't imagine someone in their 40s having that and that be normal.\n\n1:19:50.660 --> 1:19:54.540\n But the doctor is like, it could be nothing, could just cut it out.\n\n1:19:54.540 --> 1:19:56.740\n You don't need most of your intestine, it's a repeating pattern.\n\n1:19:56.740 --> 1:19:57.900\n Just cut that out, it could be fine.\n\n1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:01.300\n But it ended up not being fine and he was diagnosed as being terminally ill.\n\n1:20:01.300 --> 1:20:04.060\n Well, it really changed my life in a huge way.\n\n1:20:04.060 --> 1:20:09.780\n First of all, I remember immediately one summer, the summer when this happened, I started asking\n\n1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:10.780\n everyone I knew.\n\n1:20:10.780 --> 1:20:15.300\n I would ask you, I don't know if it's smart of my job to put you on the spot, I'd say,\n\n1:20:15.300 --> 1:20:19.620\n you have one year to live or two or three, what will you do differently about your life\n\n1:20:19.620 --> 1:20:20.620\n now?\n\n1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:26.580\n Lex, you have one year to live, what would you do?\n\n1:20:26.580 --> 1:20:27.580\n I mean, it's hard.\n\n1:20:27.580 --> 1:20:28.580\n I don't know if you want to answer that.\n\n1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:29.580\n No, no, no.\n\n1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:30.580\n I think about it a lot.\n\n1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:33.540\n I mean, that's a really good thing to meditate on.\n\n1:20:33.540 --> 1:20:41.300\n We can talk about maybe why you bring that up, if it is or not a heavy question.\n\n1:20:41.300 --> 1:20:52.820\n But I get, I think about mortality a lot and for me, it feels like a really good way to\n\n1:20:52.820 --> 1:20:57.820\n focus in on is what you're doing today, the people you have around you, the family you\n\n1:20:57.820 --> 1:21:04.020\n have, does it bring you joy?\n\n1:21:04.020 --> 1:21:07.180\n Does it bring you fulfillment?\n\n1:21:07.180 --> 1:21:19.460\n And basically, for me, long ago, try to be ready to die any day.\n\n1:21:19.460 --> 1:21:27.340\n So like today, I kind of woke up, look, if I was nervous about talking to you, I really\n\n1:21:27.340 --> 1:21:33.580\n admire your work and the book is very good and it's super exciting topic.\n\n1:21:33.580 --> 1:21:37.780\n But then, you know, there's this also feeling like, if this is the last conversation I have\n\n1:21:37.780 --> 1:21:43.580\n in my life, you know, if I die today, will this be, will this be the right, like am I\n\n1:21:43.580 --> 1:21:48.620\n glad today happened and it is, and I am glad today happened.\n\n1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:49.620\n So that's the way.\n\n1:21:49.620 --> 1:21:50.620\n And that's so unique.\n\n1:21:50.620 --> 1:21:54.620\n I never got that answer from a single person.\n\n1:21:54.620 --> 1:22:00.340\n The busyness of life, there's goals, there's dreams, there's like planning, plans.\n\n1:22:00.340 --> 1:22:02.860\n Very few people make it happen.\n\n1:22:02.860 --> 1:22:04.280\n That's what I learned.\n\n1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:05.280\n And so a lot of these people.\n\n1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.380\n Oh, like you run out of time.\n\n1:22:07.380 --> 1:22:09.860\n It's not so much you run out of time, but I'd come back later and be like, okay, why\n\n1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:10.860\n don't you do that?\n\n1:22:10.860 --> 1:22:14.340\n And if that's what you would do, if you're going to die a year from now, why don't you,\n\n1:22:14.340 --> 1:22:16.640\n why don't you make it real?\n\n1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:17.640\n Simple things.\n\n1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:18.640\n Spend more time with family.\n\n1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:19.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:20.640\n Like why, why don't you do that?\n\n1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:24.640\n And that's what I had an answer, it turns out, unless you usually, unless you have,\n\n1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:29.120\n you really do have a pressing end of life, people don't do their bucket lists or try\n\n1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:30.360\n to change their career.\n\n1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:31.360\n And some people can't.\n\n1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:33.900\n So we can't, like for a lot of people, they can't do anything about it.\n\n1:22:33.900 --> 1:22:34.900\n And that's, that's fine.\n\n1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:38.100\n But the ones who can take action for some reason, never do.\n\n1:22:38.100 --> 1:22:44.140\n And that was one of the ways that Mike's death or at the time his impending death really,\n\n1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:45.140\n really affected me.\n\n1:22:45.140 --> 1:22:48.980\n Cause you know, for these sick people, what I learned, he had a bucket list and he was\n\n1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:50.300\n able to do some of the bucket lists.\n\n1:22:50.300 --> 1:22:51.980\n It was awesome.\n\n1:22:51.980 --> 1:22:54.320\n But he got sick pretty quickly.\n\n1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.240\n So if you do only have a year to live, it's ironic cause you can't do, you can't do the\n\n1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:01.420\n things you wanted to do because you get too sick too fast.\n\n1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:05.980\n What were the bucket list things for you that you realized like, what am I doing with my\n\n1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:06.980\n life?\n\n1:23:06.980 --> 1:23:08.540\n That was the major concept of him.\n\n1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:09.860\n After he died, I didn't know.\n\n1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:16.040\n Like I, I was just lost because when something that profound happens, all the things I was\n\n1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:20.020\n doing, most of the things I was doing were just meaningless.\n\n1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:23.940\n It was so tough to, to find an answer for that.\n\n1:23:23.940 --> 1:23:28.780\n And that's when I settled on, I'm going to devote the rest of my life to trying to find\n\n1:23:28.780 --> 1:23:37.420\n another earth and to find out, to find that we're not alone.\n\n1:23:37.420 --> 1:23:42.100\n What is that longing for connection with others?\n\n1:23:42.100 --> 1:23:43.100\n What's that about?\n\n1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:44.100\n What do you think?\n\n1:23:44.100 --> 1:23:45.460\n Why is that so full of meaning?\n\n1:23:45.460 --> 1:23:46.460\n I don't know why.\n\n1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:48.300\n I mean, I think it's how we're hardwired.\n\n1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:54.120\n Like one of my friends some time ago, actually when my dad died, he never heard someone say\n\n1:23:54.120 --> 1:24:01.860\n this before, but he's like, Sarah, you know, why are we evolved to take death so harshly?\n\n1:24:01.860 --> 1:24:05.860\n Like what kind of society would we be if we just didn't care people died?\n\n1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:07.300\n That would be a very different type of world.\n\n1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:11.560\n How would we as a species have got to where we are?\n\n1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:16.140\n So I think that is tied hand in hand with why do we, why do we seek connection?\n\n1:24:16.140 --> 1:24:20.060\n It's just that what we were talking about before, that subconsciousness that we don't\n\n1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:21.060\n understand.\n\n1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:22.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:22.060 --> 1:24:28.620\n A couple, you know, the other side, the flip side of the coin of connection and love is\n\n1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:31.000\n a fear of loss.\n\n1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.700\n It's like that was, again, I don't know, that's what makes you appreciate the moment is that\n\n1:24:36.700 --> 1:24:37.700\n the thing ends.\n\n1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:38.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:38.700 --> 1:24:40.020\n It's definitely a hard one.\n\n1:24:40.020 --> 1:24:45.300\n The thing ends, but, and it's hard to not, you wouldn't want to limit.\n\n1:24:45.300 --> 1:24:49.220\n Like it's like my dog who I love so much, I'll start to cry.\n\n1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:50.420\n Like I can't think about the end.\n\n1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:52.740\n I know he'll age much faster than I will.\n\n1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:53.740\n And someday it will end.\n\n1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:54.740\n Right.\n\n1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:57.420\n But it's too sad to think of, but should I not have got a dog?\n\n1:24:57.420 --> 1:24:58.420\n Right.\n\n1:24:58.420 --> 1:25:02.380\n Should I have not brought this sort of joy into my life because I know it won't be forever.\n\n1:25:02.380 --> 1:25:03.380\n It's\n\n1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:08.940\n well, there's a, there's a philosopher and his Becker who wrote a book, Denial of Death\n\n1:25:08.940 --> 1:25:11.780\n and just, and warm with the cores.\n\n1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:16.020\n And there's another book talks about terror management theory, Sheldon Solomon.\n\n1:25:16.020 --> 1:25:18.820\n I just talked to him a few weeks ago.\n\n1:25:18.820 --> 1:25:24.900\n It's a brilliant philosopher, psychologist that their theory, whatever you make of it\n\n1:25:24.900 --> 1:25:32.060\n is that the fear of death is at the core of everything, everything we do.\n\n1:25:32.060 --> 1:25:40.180\n So like you're that you think you don't think about the mortality of your dog, but you do.\n\n1:25:40.180 --> 1:25:42.340\n And that's what makes the experience rich.\n\n1:25:42.340 --> 1:25:49.900\n Like there's this kind of like in the shadows lurks the, the knowledge that this won't\n\n1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:51.500\n last forever.\n\n1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:58.740\n And that makes every moment just special in some kind of a weird way that the moments\n\n1:25:58.740 --> 1:26:01.100\n are special for us humans.\n\n1:26:01.100 --> 1:26:12.500\n I mean, sorry to use romantic terms like love, but what do you make, what did you learn about\n\n1:26:12.500 --> 1:26:18.820\n love from, from losing it, from losing your husband?\n\n1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:21.980\n Well I learned to love the things I have more.\n\n1:26:21.980 --> 1:26:28.740\n I learned to love the people that I have more and to not let the little things bother me\n\n1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:30.780\n as much.\n\n1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:41.700\n What about the rediscovery or like the discovery of the little lights in the darkness?\n\n1:26:41.700 --> 1:26:52.500\n So you, the book, I think you've brilliantly described the dark parts of your journey.\n\n1:26:52.500 --> 1:27:00.420\n But maybe can you talk about how you were able to rediscover the lights?\n\n1:27:00.420 --> 1:27:02.340\n They came in many ways.\n\n1:27:02.340 --> 1:27:09.040\n And the way like to think about it is like grief is an ocean, you know, with tiny islands\n\n1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:10.980\n of the little, like, like the little lights.\n\n1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:15.380\n And eventually that ocean gets smaller and smaller and the islands like become continents\n\n1:27:15.380 --> 1:27:17.180\n with lakes.\n\n1:27:17.180 --> 1:27:22.320\n So initially it'd be like the children laughing one day or my colleagues at work who rallied\n\n1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:28.580\n around me and would take me away from my darkness to work on a project.\n\n1:27:28.580 --> 1:27:33.580\n Later on it turned out to be a group of women my age, all widows, all with children in my\n\n1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:35.360\n town.\n\n1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:40.060\n And it would be, even though it was a bit morose getting together, still very joyful\n\n1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:42.420\n at the same time.\n\n1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:47.260\n What was the journey of rediscovering love like for you?\n\n1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:57.940\n So refinding, I mean, is there some, by way of advice or insight about how to, how to\n\n1:27:57.940 --> 1:28:00.300\n rediscover the beauty of life?\n\n1:28:00.300 --> 1:28:01.300\n Of life.\n\n1:28:01.300 --> 1:28:02.300\n It's a hard one.\n\n1:28:02.300 --> 1:28:09.820\n I think you just have to stay open to being positive and just to get out there.\n\n1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:13.180\n Do you still think, do you still think about your own mortality?\n\n1:28:13.180 --> 1:28:19.960\n So you mentioned that that was a thing that you meditate on as a question when it was\n\n1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:22.420\n right there in front of you.\n\n1:28:22.420 --> 1:28:23.980\n But do you still think about it?\n\n1:28:23.980 --> 1:28:26.260\n I think I will after talking to you.\n\n1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:28.660\n But no, it's not really something I think about.\n\n1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:33.660\n I mean, I do think about the search for another earth and will, will I get there?\n\n1:28:33.660 --> 1:28:38.860\n Will I be able to conclude my search and is there one?\n\n1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:45.380\n Like as time goes by, you know, that window to solve that problem gets smaller.\n\n1:28:45.380 --> 1:28:51.500\n What would bring you, again, I apologize if this makes concrete the fact that life is\n\n1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:58.020\n finite, but what, what would bring you joy if we discovered while you're still here?\n\n1:28:58.020 --> 1:28:59.380\n What would bring me joy?\n\n1:28:59.380 --> 1:29:04.280\n Finding another earth, an earth like planet around a sun like star, knowing that there's\n\n1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:09.860\n at least one or more out there, being able to see water, that it has signs of water and\n\n1:29:09.860 --> 1:29:12.480\n being able to see some gases that don't belong.\n\n1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:18.500\n So I know that the search will continue after I'm gone enough to fuel the next generation.\n\n1:29:18.500 --> 1:29:24.140\n So just like opening the door and there's like this glimmer of hope.\n\n1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:25.820\n What do you think it will take to realize that?\n\n1:29:25.820 --> 1:29:29.760\n I mean, we've talked about all these interesting projects, star shade, especially, but is there\n\n1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:36.480\n something that you're particularly kind of hopeful about in the next 10, 20 years that\n\n1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:43.780\n might give us that, that exact glimmer of hope that there's earth like planets out there?\n\n1:29:43.780 --> 1:29:48.900\n I have to, I stand behind star shade in all cases, so, but there is this other kind of\n\n1:29:48.900 --> 1:29:53.220\n field that I, that everyone is involved in because star shade is hard.\n\n1:29:53.220 --> 1:29:58.900\n Earths are hard, but there are, there's another category of planet star type that's easier.\n\n1:29:58.900 --> 1:30:02.780\n And these are planets orbiting small red dwarf stars.\n\n1:30:02.780 --> 1:30:04.160\n They're not earth like at all.\n\n1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:08.060\n Think like earth cousin instead of earth twin, but there's a chance that we might establish\n\n1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:11.500\n that some of those have water and signs of life on them.\n\n1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:15.500\n It's nearer term than star shade and we're all working hard on that too.\n\n1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:20.220\n Let me ask by way of recommendations, I think a lot of people are curious about this kind\n\n1:30:20.220 --> 1:30:21.220\n of stuff.\n\n1:30:21.220 --> 1:30:27.400\n What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical or anything really had an impact\n\n1:30:27.400 --> 1:30:35.860\n on your life and, and or you would recommend besides of course your book.\n\n1:30:35.860 --> 1:30:38.660\n There's one book I wish everyone could read.\n\n1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:39.780\n I'm not sure if you've read it.\n\n1:30:39.780 --> 1:30:42.300\n It's actually a children's book, like a young adult book.\n\n1:30:42.300 --> 1:30:43.780\n It's called the giver.\n\n1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:44.780\n Yes.\n\n1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:48.660\n And it is the book that kids in school read now.\n\n1:30:48.660 --> 1:30:52.820\n And I only, sorry, that's not, that's wow.\n\n1:30:52.820 --> 1:30:57.300\n Sorry, that, that caught me off guard.\n\n1:30:57.300 --> 1:30:59.620\n So when I first came to this country, I didn't speak much.\n\n1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:05.980\n It's really what made me, it had a profound impact on my life and a really important moment\n\n1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:07.660\n because they give it to kids.\n\n1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:10.580\n Like I think middle school, I think, or maybe elementary, something like that.\n\n1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:12.580\n I'm so surprised you've even heard of this book.\n\n1:31:12.580 --> 1:31:13.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:13.580 --> 1:31:17.140\n So they give it, but like it's the value of giving the right book to a person at the right\n\n1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:18.140\n time.\n\n1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:19.140\n Wow.\n\n1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:22.300\n I was, I was, cause it's very accessible.\n\n1:31:22.300 --> 1:31:25.140\n Do we want to share what the story is without spoiling it?\n\n1:31:25.140 --> 1:31:28.100\n Oh yeah, you can without spoiling, right?\n\n1:31:28.100 --> 1:31:32.200\n It follows this boy in this very utopic society.\n\n1:31:32.200 --> 1:31:33.200\n That's like perfect.\n\n1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:35.140\n It's been all clean cut and made perfect actually.\n\n1:31:35.140 --> 1:31:41.340\n And as he kind of comes of age, he starts realizing something's wrong with his world.\n\n1:31:41.340 --> 1:31:42.600\n And so it's part of that question.\n\n1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:45.700\n Are we going to evolve as, I mean, this isn't what's there, but it made me wonder, you know,\n\n1:31:45.700 --> 1:31:47.660\n are we evolving to a better place?\n\n1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:52.980\n Is there a day when we can eliminate, you know, poverty and hunger and crime and sickness\n\n1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:58.260\n in this book, they pretty much have in a society that the boys in and sort of follows him.\n\n1:31:58.260 --> 1:32:01.800\n And he becomes a chosen one to be like a receiver.\n\n1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:06.820\n The givers, the old wise man who retains some of the harshness of the outside world so that\n\n1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:11.140\n he can advise the people as a sort of boy comes of age and is chosen for the special\n\n1:32:11.140 --> 1:32:12.140\n role.\n\n1:32:12.140 --> 1:32:13.840\n He finds the world isn't what he expects.\n\n1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:17.820\n And I don't know about you, but it was so profound for me because it jolts you out of\n\n1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:18.820\n reality.\n\n1:32:18.820 --> 1:32:19.940\n It's like, Oh my God, what am I doing here?\n\n1:32:19.940 --> 1:32:22.860\n I'm just going with the flow with my society.\n\n1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:26.820\n How do I think outside the box and the confines of my society, which surely carries negative\n\n1:32:26.820 --> 1:32:28.860\n things with it that we don't realize today.\n\n1:32:28.860 --> 1:32:36.540\n Yeah, and also in the flip side of that is if you do take a step outside the box on occasion,\n\n1:32:36.540 --> 1:32:39.300\n what's the psychological burden of that?\n\n1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:42.340\n Like is that, is that a step you want to take?\n\n1:32:42.340 --> 1:32:44.980\n Is that the journey you want to take?\n\n1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:45.980\n What is that life like?\n\n1:32:45.980 --> 1:32:46.980\n I don't know.\n\n1:32:46.980 --> 1:32:48.180\n I felt like from the book, you have to take it.\n\n1:32:48.180 --> 1:32:52.540\n I found from the book, I never thought like now that you're saying it, I see what you're\n\n1:32:52.540 --> 1:32:53.540\n saying.\n\n1:32:53.540 --> 1:32:56.340\n The burden is huge, but I always felt like the answer is yes, you absolutely want to\n\n1:32:56.340 --> 1:32:57.340\n know what's outside.\n\n1:32:57.340 --> 1:33:01.860\n But you can't do that if you're very, it's hard to be objective about your own reality.\n\n1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:02.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:08.620\n I mean, it's a very human instinct, but, uh, it also, the book kind of shows that, uh,\n\n1:33:08.620 --> 1:33:14.060\n it has an effect on you and this, it's a really interesting question about our society and\n\n1:33:14.060 --> 1:33:16.320\n taking a step out.\n\n1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:20.580\n It's by, uh, Lois Lowry, I think is how you pronounce it.\n\n1:33:20.580 --> 1:33:24.160\n I really do hope everyone created it and it is a young adult book, but it's still, it's\n\n1:33:24.160 --> 1:33:27.300\n incredibly, I'm really glad I only read it cause my kids got it for school.\n\n1:33:27.300 --> 1:33:29.780\n I just thought, okay, well, why don't I just see what this is about?\n\n1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:31.780\n And I just, wow.\n\n1:33:31.780 --> 1:33:32.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:32.780 --> 1:33:33.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:33.780 --> 1:33:35.180\n I think it's also the value of education.\n\n1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:38.860\n I think I'm surprised you mentioned, I've never really mentioned to anybody.\n\n1:33:38.860 --> 1:33:44.020\n I'm sure a lot of people had the similar experience like me and maybe it's a generational thing\n\n1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:46.340\n though, because like the book came out, I think in the nineties.\n\n1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:50.980\n So if you're older than like me, that book didn't exist when we were in middle school.\n\n1:33:50.980 --> 1:33:54.700\n So I just do think a lot of people won't have heard of it, but it's an interesting question\n\n1:33:54.700 --> 1:33:58.260\n of like those books.\n\n1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:03.060\n I mean, I'm reminded often, I suppose the same is true with other subjects, but books\n\n1:34:03.060 --> 1:34:09.260\n are special at the early age, like middle school, maybe early high school, those can\n\n1:34:09.260 --> 1:34:11.980\n change like the direction of your life.\n\n1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:17.940\n And also certainly teachers, they can change completely the direction of your life.\n\n1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:24.140\n There's so many stories about teachers of mathematics, teachers of physics, of any kind\n\n1:34:24.140 --> 1:34:27.580\n of subjects basically changing the direction of a human's life.\n\n1:34:27.580 --> 1:34:36.220\n That's like not to get on the whole, almost like a political thing, but you know, we,\n\n1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.860\n we undervalue teachers.\n\n1:34:38.860 --> 1:34:42.060\n It's a special, it's a special position that they hold.\n\n1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:43.060\n That's so true.\n\n1:34:43.060 --> 1:34:44.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:44.060 --> 1:34:46.740\n Well, I do have two other books or two other things.\n\n1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:50.100\n One is something I came across just a few days ago, actually.\n\n1:34:50.100 --> 1:34:54.820\n It's actually a film called Picture a Scientist.\n\n1:34:54.820 --> 1:34:59.680\n And when you picture a scientist, you probably don't picture the women and women of color\n\n1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:01.140\n in this film.\n\n1:35:01.140 --> 1:35:03.860\n And it is a way to get outside your box.\n\n1:35:03.860 --> 1:35:09.020\n I really think everyone interested in science, even just peripherally should watch this because\n\n1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:12.580\n it is shocking and sobering at the same time.\n\n1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:17.820\n And it talks about how, well, I think one of the messages across is, you know, we really\n\n1:35:17.820 --> 1:35:22.580\n are like, I don't know if we're hardwired to just like people like ourselves, but we're\n\n1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:27.020\n excluding a lot of people and therefore a lot of great ideas by not being able to think\n\n1:35:27.020 --> 1:35:30.780\n outside of how we're all stereotyping each other.\n\n1:35:30.780 --> 1:35:34.060\n So it's, it's, it's hard to kind of convey that and you can just say, oh yeah, I want\n\n1:35:34.060 --> 1:35:35.060\n to be more diverse.\n\n1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:38.860\n I want to be more open, but it's a nearly impossible problem to solve and the movie\n\n1:35:38.860 --> 1:35:42.420\n really helps open people's eyes to it.\n\n1:35:42.420 --> 1:35:46.780\n This book I put third because unlike The Giver, people may not want to read it.\n\n1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:47.780\n It's not as relevant.\n\n1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:56.180\n But when I was in my early twenties, I went to this big, this like 800 people large conference\n\n1:35:56.180 --> 1:36:00.340\n run by the Wilderness Canoe Association in my hometown of Toronto.\n\n1:36:00.340 --> 1:36:04.780\n And there was a family friend there who I met and he said, read this book, it'll change\n\n1:36:04.780 --> 1:36:06.060\n your life.\n\n1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:08.220\n And it actually changed my life.\n\n1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:13.820\n And it was a book called Sleeping Island by an author, PG Downs, who just coincidentally\n\n1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:17.820\n lived in this area, lived in the Boston area and he was a teacher, I think at a private\n\n1:36:17.820 --> 1:36:23.580\n school and every summer he would go to Canada with a canoe often by himself.\n\n1:36:23.580 --> 1:36:27.380\n And he wrote this book maybe in the forties or fifties about a trip he took in the late\n\n1:36:27.380 --> 1:36:28.380\n 1930s.\n\n1:36:28.380 --> 1:36:32.700\n And it was, I was just shocked that even at that time, although that was a long time ago,\n\n1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:37.580\n there were large parts of Canada that were untouched by white people.\n\n1:36:37.580 --> 1:36:40.480\n And he went up there and interacted like with the natives.\n\n1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:45.560\n He called the book and had a subtitle that was called, there's something like Journey\n\n1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.400\n in the Barren Lands.\n\n1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:50.740\n And when you go up North in Canada, you pass the tree line, just like on a mountain, if\n\n1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:53.580\n you hike up a mountain, you get so far North there aren't any trees.\n\n1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:56.300\n And he wrote eloquently about the land and about being out there.\n\n1:36:56.300 --> 1:37:00.520\n There weren't even any maps of the region, like in that time.\n\n1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:04.540\n And I just thought to myself, wow, like that you could just take the summer off and explore\n\n1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:07.540\n by canoe and go and see what's out there.\n\n1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:10.620\n And it led to me just doing that, that very thing.\n\n1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:14.980\n Of course it's different now, but going out to where the road ends and putting the canoe\n\n1:37:14.980 --> 1:37:16.740\n in the water and just, well, we had to have a plan.\n\n1:37:16.740 --> 1:37:21.780\n We didn't just explore, but go down this river, rivers with rapids and travel over lakes and\n\n1:37:21.780 --> 1:37:25.540\n portages and just really live.\n\n1:37:25.540 --> 1:37:27.540\n So just really explore, screw it.\n\n1:37:27.540 --> 1:37:31.540\n That doesn't like, it doesn't explore just use from a topo map, from a topographical\n\n1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:33.540\n map from the library.\n\n1:37:33.540 --> 1:37:41.100\n There were scary elements about it, out of it, but part of the excitement or the joy\n\n1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:45.900\n or the desire was to be scared, like it was to go out there and have live on the edge.\n\n1:37:45.900 --> 1:37:46.900\n And persevere.\n\n1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:47.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:47.900 --> 1:37:48.900\n And persevere.\n\n1:37:48.900 --> 1:37:49.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:56.540\n Do you have a advice that you would give to a young person today that would like to help\n\n1:37:56.540 --> 1:38:03.140\n you maybe on the planetary science side, discover exoplanets or maybe bigger picture, just\n\n1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:04.140\n succeed in life?\n\n1:38:04.140 --> 1:38:06.380\n I do have some advice just to succeed.\n\n1:38:06.380 --> 1:38:11.260\n It's tough advice in a way, but it is to find something that you love doing that you're\n\n1:38:11.260 --> 1:38:13.060\n also very good at.\n\n1:38:13.060 --> 1:38:17.500\n And in some ways the stars have to align because you've got to find that thing you're good\n\n1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:21.780\n at or the range of things, and it actually has to overlap with something that actually\n\n1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:23.340\n you love doing every day.\n\n1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:26.140\n So it's not a tedious job.\n\n1:38:26.140 --> 1:38:27.500\n That's the best way to succeed.\n\n1:38:27.500 --> 1:38:33.060\n What were the signals that in your own life were there to make you realize you're good\n\n1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:35.780\n at something?\n\n1:38:35.780 --> 1:38:44.180\n What were you good at that made you pursue a PhD and it made you pursue the search?\n\n1:38:44.180 --> 1:38:46.980\n I mean, that was the one sentence version.\n\n1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:51.220\n In my case, it was a long slog and there were a lot of things I wasn't good at initially.\n\n1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:53.180\n But so initially, I was good at high school math.\n\n1:38:53.180 --> 1:38:55.140\n I was good at high school science.\n\n1:38:55.140 --> 1:38:58.580\n I loved astronomy and I realized those could all fit together.\n\n1:38:58.580 --> 1:39:02.740\n Like the day I realized you could be an astronomer for a job, it has to be one of my top days\n\n1:39:02.740 --> 1:39:03.740\n of my life.\n\n1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:08.020\n I didn't know that you could be that for a job and I was good at all those things.\n\n1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:11.540\n And although my dad wanted me to do something more practical where he could be guaranteed\n\n1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:16.860\n I could support myself was another option, but initially I wasn't that good at physics.\n\n1:39:16.860 --> 1:39:21.140\n It was a slog to just get through school and grad school is a very, very long time.\n\n1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:26.220\n And ultimately, when faced with a choice and I had the luxury of choosing, knowing that\n\n1:39:26.220 --> 1:39:29.060\n I was good at something and also loved it, it really carried me through.\n\n1:39:29.060 --> 1:39:34.380\n Now, I asked some of the smartest people in the world the most ridiculous question.\n\n1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:42.140\n We already talked about it a little bit, but let me ask again, why are we here?\n\n1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:47.020\n I think you've raised this question in one of your presentations as like one of the things\n\n1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:52.940\n that we kind of as humans long to answer and the search for exoplanets is kind of part\n\n1:39:52.940 --> 1:39:53.940\n of that.\n\n1:39:53.940 --> 1:39:57.220\n But what do you think is the meaning of it all, of life?\n\n1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:02.980\n I wish I had a good answer for you.\n\n1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:07.140\n I think you're the first person ever who refused to answer the question.\n\n1:40:07.140 --> 1:40:11.540\n It's not so much refusing, I just, yeah, I mean, I wish I had a better answer.\n\n1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:12.860\n It's why we're here.\n\n1:40:12.860 --> 1:40:20.540\n It's almost like the meaning is wishing there was a meaning, wishing we knew.\n\n1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:21.540\n I love that.\n\n1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:24.460\n That's a great way to say it.\n\n1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:27.140\n Sarah, like I said, the book is excellent.\n\n1:40:27.140 --> 1:40:33.620\n I admired your work from afar for a while and I think you're one of the great stars\n\n1:40:33.620 --> 1:40:34.620\n at MIT.\n\n1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:37.340\n It makes me proud to be part of the community.\n\n1:40:37.340 --> 1:40:40.260\n So thank you so much for your work.\n\n1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:41.500\n Thank you for inspiring all of us.\n\n1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:42.500\n Thanks for talking today.\n\n1:40:42.500 --> 1:40:45.060\n Thank you so much, Lynx.\n\n1:40:45.060 --> 1:40:47.500\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with

something incredible\n\n1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:23.000\n is waiting to be known.\n\n1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:39.820\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
