you believe that people expressing themselves\n\n00:06.440 --> 00:07.280\n is a good thing.\n\n00:07.280 --> 00:08.640\n Let me ask you as a father,\n\n00:08.640 --> 00:09.760\n there's a weight heavy on you\n\n00:09.760 --> 00:13.000\n that people get bullied on social networks.\n\n00:13.000 --> 00:14.440\n I care a lot about how people feel\n\n00:14.440 --> 00:15.460\n when they use our products\n\n00:15.460 --> 00:19.320\n and I don't want to build products that make people angry.\n\n00:19.320 --> 00:22.000\n Why do you think so many people dislike you?\n\n00:23.440 --> 00:25.580\n Some even hate you.\n\n00:25.580 --> 00:30.160\n And how do you regain their trust and support?\n\n00:30.160 --> 00:32.720\n The following is a conversation with Mark Zuckerberg,\n\n00:32.720 --> 00:35.700\n CEO of Facebook, now called Meta.\n\n00:36.760 --> 00:38.680\n Please allow me to say a few words\n\n00:38.680 --> 00:41.300\n about this conversation with Mark Zuckerberg,\n\n00:41.300 --> 00:42.680\n about social media,\n\n00:42.680 --> 00:45.440\n and about what troubles me in the world today,\n\n00:45.440 --> 00:47.760\n and what gives me hope.\n\n00:47.760 --> 00:49.480\n If this is not interesting to you,\n\n00:49.480 --> 00:51.540\n I understand, please skip.\n\n00:51.540 --> 00:54.620\n I believe that at its best,\n\n00:54.620 --> 00:57.800\n social media puts a mirror to humanity\n\n00:57.800 --> 01:01.060\n and reveals the full complexity of our world,\n\n01:01.060 --> 01:04.080\n shining a light on the dark aspects of human nature\n\n01:04.080 --> 01:06.700\n and giving us hope, a way out,\n\n01:06.700 --> 01:09.780\n through compassionate but tense chaos of conversation\n\n01:09.780 --> 01:12.780\n that eventually can turn into understanding,\n\n01:12.780 --> 01:14.680\n friendship, and even love.\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:17.460\n But this is not simple.\n\n01:17.460 --> 01:19.580\n Our world is not simple.\n\n01:19.580 --> 01:21.460\n It is full of human suffering.\n\n01:22.340 --> 01:24.460\n I think about the hundreds of millions of people\n\n01:24.460 --> 01:28.460\n who are starving and who live in extreme poverty,\n\n01:28.460 --> 01:31.600\n the one million people who take their own life every year,\n\n01:31.600 --> 01:33.940\n the 20 million people that attempt it,\n\n01:33.940 --> 01:37.380\n and the many, many more millions who suffer quietly\n\n01:37.380 --> 01:39.380\n in ways that numbers can never know.\n\n01:40.740 --> 01:44.660\n I'm troubled by the cruelty and pain of war.\n\n01:44.660 --> 01:48.540\n Today, my heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.\n\n01:48.540 --> 01:52.220\n My grandfather spilled his blood on this land,\n\n01:52.220 --> 01:54.020\n held the line as a machine gunner\n\n01:54.020 --> 01:59.020\n against the Nazi invasion, surviving impossible odds.\n\n01:59.180 --> 02:01.380\n I am nothing without him.\n\n02:01.380 --> 02:03.540\n His blood runs in my blood.\n\n02:04.980 --> 02:07.560\n My words are useless here.\n\n02:07.560 --> 02:09.020\n I send my love.\n\n02:09.020 --> 02:10.180\n It's all I have.\n\n02:11.160 --> 02:14.140\n I hope to travel to Russia and Ukraine soon.\n\n02:14.140 --> 02:16.780\n I will speak to citizens and leaders,\n\n02:16.780 --> 02:18.920\n including Vladimir Putin.\n\n02:19.980 --> 02:22.700\n As I've said in the past, I don't care about access,\n\n02:22.700 --> 02:26.760\n fame, money, or power, and I'm afraid of nothing.\n\n02:27.660 --> 02:31.100\n But I am who I am, and my goal in conversation\n\n02:31.100 --> 02:33.460\n is to understand the human being before me,\n\n02:33.460 --> 02:36.540\n no matter who they are, no matter their position.\n\n02:36.540 --> 02:40.060\n And I do believe the line between good and evil\n\n02:40.060 --> 02:42.480\n runs through the heart of every man.\n\n02:43.540 --> 02:45.380\n So this is it.\n\n02:45.380 --> 02:47.420\n This is our world.\n\n02:47.420 --> 02:50.680\n It is full of hate, violence, and destruction.\n\n02:51.720 --> 02:55.300\n But it is also full of love, beauty,\n\n02:55.300 --> 02:57.540\n and the insatiable desire to help each other.\n\n02:59.140 --> 03:01.320\n The people who run the social networks\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:05.380\n that show this world, that show us to ourselves,\n\n03:05.380 --> 03:08.500\n have the greatest of responsibilities.\n\n03:08.500 --> 03:11.740\n In a time of war, pandemic, atrocity,\n\n03:11.740 --> 03:14.460\n we turn to social networks to share real human insights\n\n03:14.460 --> 03:18.620\n and experiences, to organize protests and celebrations,\n\n03:18.620 --> 03:21.940\n to learn and to challenge our understanding of the world,\n\n03:21.940 --> 03:24.300\n of our history and of our future,\n\n03:24.300 --> 03:27.460\n and above all, to be reminded of our common humanity.\n\n03:28.500 --> 03:30.500\n When the social networks fail,\n\n03:30.500 --> 03:33.640\n they have the power to cause immense suffering.\n\n03:33.640 --> 03:35.020\n And when they succeed,\n\n03:35.020 --> 03:37.820\n they have the power to lessen that suffering.\n\n03:37.820 --> 03:39.340\n This is hard.\n\n03:39.340 --> 03:41.080\n It's a responsibility, perhaps,\n\n03:41.080 --> 03:44.080\n almost unlike any other in history.\n\n03:44.080 --> 03:47.260\n This podcast conversation attempts to understand the man\n\n03:47.260 --> 03:50.680\n and the company who take this responsibility on,\n\n03:50.680 --> 03:53.260\n where they fail and where they hope to succeed.\n\n03:54.260 --> 03:57.920\n Mark Zuckerberg's feet are often held to the fire,\n\n03:57.920 --> 04:01.540\n as they should be, and this actually gives me hope.\n\n04:01.540 --> 04:03.900\n The power of innovation and engineering,\n\n04:03.900 --> 04:05.560\n coupled with the freedom of speech\n\n04:05.560 --> 04:07.700\n in the form of its highest ideal,\n\n04:07.700 --> 04:11.140\n I believe can solve any problem in the world.\n\n04:11.140 --> 04:14.780\n But that's just it, both are necessary,\n\n04:14.780 --> 04:16.660\n the engineer and the critic.\n\n04:17.620 --> 04:22.620\n I believe that criticism is essential, but cynicism is not.\n\n04:23.260 --> 04:25.660\n And I worry that in our public discourse,\n\n04:25.660 --> 04:30.380\n cynicism too easily masquerades as wisdom, as truth,\n\n04:30.380 --> 04:32.220\n becomes viral and takes over,\n\n04:32.220 --> 04:35.460\n and worse, suffocates the dreams of young minds\n\n04:35.460 --> 04:39.260\n who want to build solutions to the problems of the world.\n\n04:39.260 --> 04:41.540\n We need to inspire those young minds.\n\n04:41.540 --> 04:43.720\n At least for me, they give me hope.\n\n04:44.580 --> 04:47.160\n And one small way I'm trying to contribute\n\n04:47.160 --> 04:49.520\n is to have honest conversations like these\n\n04:49.520 --> 04:53.260\n that don't just ride the viral wave of cynicism,\n\n04:53.260 --> 04:54.900\n but seek to understand the failures\n\n04:54.900 --> 04:57.940\n and successes of the past, the problems before us,\n\n04:57.940 --> 04:59.540\n and the possible solutions\n\n04:59.540 --> 05:02.560\n in this very complicated world of ours.\n\n05:02.560 --> 05:05.820\n I'm sure I will fail often,\n\n05:05.820 --> 05:10.180\n and I count on the critic to point it out when I do.\n\n05:10.180 --> 05:12.540\n But I ask for one thing,\n\n05:12.540 --> 05:15.180\n and that is to fuel the fire of optimism,\n\n05:15.180 --> 05:18.340\n especially in those who dream to build solutions,\n\n05:18.340 --> 05:21.780\n because without that, we don't have a chance\n\n05:21.780 --> 05:24.600\n on this too fragile, tiny planet of ours.\n\n05:25.820 --> 05:28.020\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n05:28.020 --> 05:30.260\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n05:30.260 --> 05:31.620\n in the description.\n\n05:31.620 --> 05:35.680\n And now, dear friends, here's Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n05:40.980 --> 05:43.180\n Can you circle all the traffic lights, please?\n\n05:53.880 --> 05:54.860\n You actually did it.\n\n05:54.860 --> 05:56.820\n That is very impressive performance.\n\n05:56.820 --> 06:00.020\n Okay, now we can initiate the interview procedure.\n\n06:00.020 --> 06:02.980\n Is it possible that this conversation is happening\n\n06:02.980 --> 06:05.380\n inside a metaverse created by you,\n\n06:05.380 --> 06:07.180\n by Meta many years from now,\n\n06:07.180 --> 06:10.180\n and we're doing a memory replay experience?\n\n06:10.180 --> 06:11.260\n I don't know the answer to that.\n\n06:11.260 --> 06:15.220\n Then I'd be some computer construct\n\n06:15.220 --> 06:18.980\n and not the person who created that Meta company.\n\n06:18.980 --> 06:20.500\n But that would truly be Meta.\n\n06:21.380 --> 06:23.360\n Right, so this could be somebody else\n\n06:23.360 --> 06:26.420\n using the Mark Zuckerberg avatar\n\n06:26.420 --> 06:29.200\n who can do the Mark and the Lex conversation replay\n\n06:29.200 --> 06:33.340\n from four decades ago when Meta, it was first sort of.\n\n06:33.340 --> 06:34.780\n I mean, it's not gonna be four decades\n\n06:34.780 --> 06:38.020\n before we have photorealistic avatars like this.\n\n06:38.020 --> 06:40.100\n So I think we're much closer to that.\n\n06:40.100 --> 06:41.380\n Well, that's something you talk about\n\n06:41.380 --> 06:43.500\n is how passionate you are about the idea\n\n06:43.500 --> 06:46.580\n of the avatar representing who you are in the metaverse.\n\n06:46.580 --> 06:49.260\n So I do these podcasts in person.\n\n06:51.100 --> 06:52.260\n You know, I'm a stickler for that,\n\n06:52.260 --> 06:55.780\n because there's a magic to the in person conversation.\n\n06:55.780 --> 06:58.140\n How long do you think it'll be before\n\n06:58.140 --> 07:00.620\n you can have the same kind of magic in the metaverse,\n\n07:00.620 --> 07:02.620\n the same kind of intimacy in the chemistry,\n\n07:02.620 --> 07:06.060\n whatever the heck is there when we're talking in person?\n\n07:06.060 --> 07:07.100\n How difficult is it?\n\n07:07.100 --> 07:09.340\n How long before we have it in the metaverse?\n\n07:10.340 --> 07:12.940\n Well, I think this is like the key question, right?\n\n07:12.940 --> 07:17.500\n Because the thing that's different about virtual\n\n07:17.500 --> 07:19.140\n and hopefully augmented reality\n\n07:19.140 --> 07:22.400\n compared to all other forms of digital platforms before\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:24.420\n is this feeling of presence, right?\n\n07:24.420 --> 07:25.860\n The feeling that you're right,\n\n07:25.860 --> 07:27.000\n that you're in an experience\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.700\n and that you're there with other people or in another place.\n\n07:29.700 --> 07:32.300\n And that's just different from all of the other screens\n\n07:32.300 --> 07:33.900\n that we have today, right?\n\n07:33.900 --> 07:36.780\n Phones, TVs, all the stuff.\n\n07:36.780 --> 07:39.500\n They're trying to, in some cases, deliver experiences\n\n07:39.500 --> 07:43.040\n that feel high fidelity,\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:46.380\n but at no point do you actually feel like you're in it, right?\n\n07:46.380 --> 07:49.660\n At some level, your content is trying to sort of convince you\n\n07:49.660 --> 07:51.980\n that this is a realistic thing that's happening,\n\n07:51.980 --> 07:54.860\n but all of the kind of subtle signals are telling you,\n\n07:54.860 --> 07:56.500\n no, you're looking at a screen.\n\n07:56.500 --> 08:00.700\n So the question about how you develop these systems is like,\n\n08:00.700 --> 08:03.860\n what are all of the things that make the physical world\n\n08:03.860 --> 08:04.900\n all the different cues?\n\n08:04.900 --> 08:09.900\n So I think on visual presence and spatial audio,\n\n08:13.080 --> 08:15.440\n we're making reasonable progress.\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:16.940\n Spatial audio makes a huge deal.\n\n08:16.940 --> 08:19.620\n I don't know if you've tried this experience,\n\n08:19.620 --> 08:21.960\n workrooms that we launched where you have meetings.\n\n08:21.960 --> 08:26.380\n And I basically made a rule for all of the top,\n\n08:26.380 --> 08:27.760\n you know, management folks at the company\n\n08:27.760 --> 08:29.520\n that they need to be doing standing meetings\n\n08:29.520 --> 08:31.720\n in workrooms already, right?\n\n08:31.720 --> 08:33.260\n I feel like we got to dog food this,\n\n08:33.260 --> 08:35.760\n you know, this is how people are gonna work in the future.\n\n08:35.760 --> 08:37.840\n So we have to adopt this now.\n\n08:38.800 --> 08:40.780\n And there were already a lot of things\n\n08:40.780 --> 08:42.280\n that I think feel significantly better\n\n08:42.280 --> 08:44.740\n than like typical Zoom meetings,\n\n08:44.740 --> 08:47.440\n even though the avatars are a lot lower fidelity.\n\n08:48.620 --> 08:50.780\n You know, the idea that you have spatial audio,\n\n08:50.780 --> 08:53.940\n you're around a table in VR with people.\n\n08:53.940 --> 08:55.260\n If someone's talking from over there,\n\n08:55.260 --> 08:56.860\n it sounds like it's talking from over there.\n\n08:56.860 --> 08:59.960\n You can see, you know, the arm gestures\n\n08:59.960 --> 09:01.760\n and stuff feel more natural.\n\n09:01.760 --> 09:03.080\n You can have side conversations,\n\n09:03.080 --> 09:04.860\n which is something that you can't really do in Zoom.\n\n09:04.860 --> 09:06.940\n I mean, I guess you can text someone over,\n\n09:06.940 --> 09:08.740\n like out of band,\n\n09:08.740 --> 09:12.000\n but if you're actually sitting around a table with people,\n\n09:12.940 --> 09:14.200\n you know, you can lean over\n\n09:14.200 --> 09:15.580\n and whisper to the person next to you\n\n09:15.580 --> 09:17.760\n and like have a conversation that you can't,\n\n09:17.760 --> 09:19.100\n you know, that you can't really do\n\n09:19.100 --> 09:23.500\n with in just video communication.\n\n09:23.500 --> 09:27.500\n So I think it's interesting in what ways\n\n09:27.500 --> 09:29.820\n some of these things already feel more real\n\n09:29.820 --> 09:32.580\n than a lot of the technology that we have,\n\n09:32.580 --> 09:35.040\n even when the visual fidelity isn't quite there,\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:37.180\n but I think it'll get there over the next few years.\n\n09:37.180 --> 09:38.740\n Now, I mean, you were asking about comparing that\n\n09:38.740 --> 09:40.500\n to the true physical world,\n\n09:40.500 --> 09:42.740\n not Zoom or something like that.\n\n09:42.740 --> 09:45.700\n And there, I mean, I think you have feelings\n\n09:45.700 --> 09:50.700\n of like temperature, you know, olfactory,\n\n09:50.700 --> 09:54.380\n obviously touch, right, we're working on haptic gloves,\n\n09:54.380 --> 09:56.300\n you know, the sense that you wanna be able to,\n\n09:56.300 --> 09:57.220\n you know, put your hands down\n\n09:57.220 --> 09:59.740\n and feel some pressure from the table.\n\n09:59.740 --> 10:00.580\n You know, all of these things\n\n10:00.580 --> 10:01.740\n I think are gonna be really critical\n\n10:01.740 --> 10:04.660\n to be able to keep up this illusion\n\n10:04.660 --> 10:06.820\n that you're in a world\n\n10:06.820 --> 10:08.820\n and that you're fully present in this world.\n\n10:08.820 --> 10:09.740\n But I don't know,\n\n10:09.740 --> 10:11.640\n I think we're gonna have a lot of these building blocks\n\n10:11.640 --> 10:14.220\n within, you know, the next 10 years or so.\n\n10:14.220 --> 10:15.920\n And even before that, I think it's amazing\n\n10:15.920 --> 10:18.140\n how much you're just gonna be able to build with software\n\n10:18.140 --> 10:21.380\n that sort of masks some of these things.\n\n10:21.380 --> 10:22.780\n I realize I'm going long,\n\n10:22.780 --> 10:25.300\n but I was told we have a few hours here.\n\n10:25.300 --> 10:26.140\n So it's a...\n\n10:26.140 --> 10:27.220\n We're here for five to six hours.\n\n10:27.220 --> 10:28.740\n Yeah, so I mean, it's, look,\n\n10:28.740 --> 10:30.460\n I mean, that's on the shorter end\n\n10:30.460 --> 10:32.540\n of the congressional testimonies I've done.\n\n10:32.540 --> 10:36.300\n But it's, but, you know, one of the things\n\n10:36.300 --> 10:39.540\n that we found with hand presence, right?\n\n10:39.540 --> 10:42.000\n So the earliest VR, you just have the headset\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.440\n and then, and that was cool, you could look around,\n\n10:44.440 --> 10:45.380\n you feel like you're in a place,\n\n10:45.380 --> 10:47.380\n but you don't feel like you're really able to interact with it\n\n10:47.380 --> 10:48.540\n until you have hands.\n\n10:48.540 --> 10:49.620\n And then there was this big question\n\n10:49.620 --> 10:51.340\n where once you got hands,\n\n10:51.340 --> 10:53.460\n what's the right way to represent them?\n\n10:53.460 --> 10:58.460\n And initially, all of our assumptions was, okay,\n\n10:58.560 --> 11:00.420\n when I look down and see my hands in the physical world,\n\n11:00.420 --> 11:02.780\n I see an arm and it's gonna be super weird\n\n11:02.780 --> 11:04.820\n if you see, you know, just your hand.\n\n11:06.460 --> 11:08.060\n But it turned out to not be the case\n\n11:08.060 --> 11:09.860\n because there's this issue with your arms,\n\n11:09.860 --> 11:11.540\n which is like, what's your elbow angle?\n\n11:11.540 --> 11:14.780\n And if the elbow angle that we're kind of interpolating\n\n11:14.780 --> 11:18.660\n based on where your hand is and where your headset is\n\n11:18.660 --> 11:19.940\n actually isn't accurate,\n\n11:19.940 --> 11:21.900\n it creates this very uncomfortable feeling\n\n11:21.900 --> 11:24.440\n where it's like, oh, like my arm is actually out like this,\n\n11:24.440 --> 11:25.940\n but it's like showing it in here.\n\n11:25.940 --> 11:29.540\n And that actually broke the feeling of presence a lot more.\n\n11:29.540 --> 11:31.900\n Whereas it turns out that if you just show the hands\n\n11:31.900 --> 11:33.740\n and you don't show the arms,\n\n11:34.840 --> 11:36.220\n it actually is fine for people.\n\n11:36.220 --> 11:38.420\n So I think that there's a bunch\n\n11:38.420 --> 11:41.060\n of these interesting psychological cues\n\n11:41.060 --> 11:44.980\n where it'll be more about getting the right details right.\n\n11:44.980 --> 11:46.940\n And I think a lot of that will be possible\n\n11:46.940 --> 11:49.780\n even over a few year period or a five year period.\n\n11:49.780 --> 11:52.100\n And we won't need like every single thing to be solved\n\n11:52.100 --> 11:54.620\n to deliver this like full sense of presence.\n\n11:54.620 --> 11:56.500\n Yeah, it's a fascinating psychology question\n\n11:56.500 --> 11:59.960\n of what is the essence\n\n11:59.960 --> 12:04.260\n that makes in person conversation special?\n\n12:04.260 --> 12:08.020\n It's like emojis are able to convey emotion really well,\n\n12:08.020 --> 12:10.580\n even though they're obviously not photorealistic.\n\n12:10.580 --> 12:12.460\n And so in that same way, Jessica, you're saying,\n\n12:12.460 --> 12:14.260\n just showing the hands is able\n\n12:14.260 --> 12:18.180\n to create a comfortable expression with your hands.\n\n12:18.180 --> 12:19.520\n So I wonder what that is.\n\n12:19.520 --> 12:21.920\n People in the world wars used to write letters\n\n12:21.920 --> 12:24.380\n and you can fall in love with just writing letters.\n\n12:24.380 --> 12:26.640\n You don't need to see each other in person.\n\n12:26.640 --> 12:27.700\n You can convey emotion.\n\n12:27.700 --> 12:32.700\n You can be depth of experience with just words.\n\n12:32.740 --> 12:35.740\n So that's, I think, a fascinating place\n\n12:35.740 --> 12:37.460\n to explore psychology of like,\n\n12:37.460 --> 12:39.220\n how do you find that intimacy?\n\n12:39.220 --> 12:42.700\n Yeah, and the way that I come to all of this stuff is,\n\n12:42.700 --> 12:45.060\n I basically studied psychology and computer science.\n\n12:45.060 --> 12:47.900\n So all of the work that I do\n\n12:47.900 --> 12:49.900\n is sort of at the intersection of those things.\n\n12:49.900 --> 12:52.180\n I think most of the other big tech companies\n\n12:52.180 --> 12:55.060\n are building technology for you to interact with.\n\n12:55.060 --> 12:56.680\n What I care about is building technology\n\n12:56.680 --> 12:58.100\n to help people interact with each other.\n\n12:58.100 --> 12:59.900\n So I think it's a somewhat different approach\n\n12:59.900 --> 13:02.300\n than most of the other tech entrepreneurs\n\n13:02.300 --> 13:04.340\n and big companies come at this from.\n\n13:04.340 --> 13:08.980\n And a lot of the lessons\n\n13:08.980 --> 13:10.980\n in terms of how I think about designing products\n\n13:10.980 --> 13:15.980\n come from some just basic elements of psychology, right?\n\n13:15.980 --> 13:19.060\n In terms of our brains,\n\n13:19.060 --> 13:22.080\n you can compare it to the brains of other animals.\n\n13:22.080 --> 13:25.560\n We're very wired to specific things, facial expressions.\n\n13:25.560 --> 13:28.200\n I mean, we're very visual, right?\n\n13:28.200 --> 13:29.340\n So compared to other animals,\n\n13:29.340 --> 13:31.820\n I mean, that's clearly the main sense\n\n13:31.820 --> 13:32.980\n that most people have.\n\n13:32.980 --> 13:35.260\n But there's a whole part of your brain\n\n13:35.260 --> 13:38.560\n that's just kind of focused on reading facial cues.\n\n13:38.560 --> 13:42.180\n So when we're designing the next version of Quest\n\n13:42.180 --> 13:45.820\n or the VR headset, a big focus for us is face tracking\n\n13:45.820 --> 13:48.860\n and basically eye tracking so you can make eye contact,\n\n13:48.860 --> 13:50.100\n which again, isn't really something\n\n13:50.100 --> 13:51.500\n that you can do over a video conference.\n\n13:51.500 --> 13:55.500\n It's sort of amazing how far video conferencing\n\n13:55.500 --> 13:58.620\n has gotten without the ability to make eye contact, right?\n\n13:58.620 --> 14:00.540\n It's sort of a bizarre thing if you think about it.\n\n14:00.540 --> 14:03.140\n You're looking at someone's face,\n\n14:03.140 --> 14:05.620\n sometimes for an hour when you're in a meeting\n\n14:05.620 --> 14:08.960\n and you looking at their eyes to them\n\n14:08.960 --> 14:11.780\n doesn't look like you're looking at their eyes.\n\n14:11.780 --> 14:15.020\n You're always looking past each other, I guess.\n\n14:15.020 --> 14:15.860\n I guess you're right.\n\n14:15.860 --> 14:16.680\n You're not sending that signal.\n\n14:16.680 --> 14:17.520\n Well, you're trying to.\n\n14:17.520 --> 14:18.360\n Right, you're trying to.\n\n14:18.360 --> 14:19.760\n A lot of times, or at least I find myself,\n\n14:19.760 --> 14:21.420\n I'm trying to look into the other person's eyes.\n\n14:21.420 --> 14:23.060\n But they don't feel like you're looking to their eyes.\n\n14:23.060 --> 14:23.900\n So then the question is,\n\n14:23.900 --> 14:25.220\n all right, am I supposed to look at the camera\n\n14:25.220 --> 14:27.800\n so that way you can have a sensation\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:28.640\n that I'm looking at you?\n\n14:28.640 --> 14:30.140\n I think that that's an interesting question.\n\n14:30.140 --> 14:33.820\n And then with VR today,\n\n14:33.820 --> 14:35.660\n even without eye tracking\n\n14:35.660 --> 14:37.500\n and knowing what your eyes are actually looking at,\n\n14:37.500 --> 14:39.380\n you can fake it reasonably well, right?\n\n14:39.380 --> 14:42.240\n So you can look at where the head pose is.\n\n14:42.240 --> 14:43.720\n And if it looks like I'm kind of looking\n\n14:43.720 --> 14:44.680\n in your general direction,\n\n14:44.680 --> 14:46.500\n then you can sort of assume\n\n14:46.500 --> 14:48.640\n that maybe there's some eye contact intended\n\n14:48.640 --> 14:50.740\n and you can do it in a way where it's like,\n\n14:50.740 --> 14:54.300\n okay, maybe it's not a fixated stare,\n\n14:54.300 --> 14:56.880\n but it's somewhat natural.\n\n14:56.880 --> 14:58.740\n But once you have actual eye tracking,\n\n14:58.740 --> 15:00.180\n you can do it for real.\n\n15:00.180 --> 15:02.140\n And I think that that's really important stuff.\n\n15:02.140 --> 15:05.300\n So when I think about Meta's contribution to this field,\n\n15:05.300 --> 15:06.640\n I have to say it's not clear to me\n\n15:06.640 --> 15:08.700\n that any of the other companies\n\n15:08.700 --> 15:11.180\n that are focused on the Metaverse\n\n15:11.180 --> 15:13.340\n or on virtual and augmented reality\n\n15:13.340 --> 15:15.820\n are gonna prioritize putting these features in the hardware\n\n15:15.820 --> 15:18.260\n because like everything, they're trade offs, right?\n\n15:18.260 --> 15:21.500\n I mean, it adds some weight to the device.\n\n15:21.500 --> 15:22.740\n Maybe it adds some thickness.\n\n15:22.740 --> 15:24.840\n You could totally see another company taking the approach\n\n15:24.840 --> 15:27.600\n of let's just make the lightest and thinnest thing possible.\n\n15:27.600 --> 15:31.380\n But I want us to design the most human thing possible\n\n15:31.380 --> 15:33.340\n that creates the richest sense of presence\n\n15:33.340 --> 15:37.900\n and cause so much of human emotion and expression\n\n15:37.900 --> 15:39.500\n comes from these like micro movements.\n\n15:39.500 --> 15:41.800\n If I like move my eyebrow millimeter,\n\n15:41.800 --> 15:44.640\n you will notice and that like means something.\n\n15:44.640 --> 15:46.840\n So the fact that we're losing these signals\n\n15:46.840 --> 15:49.940\n and a lot of communication I think is a loss.\n\n15:49.940 --> 15:51.700\n So it's not like, okay, there's one feature\n\n15:51.700 --> 15:53.300\n and you add this, then it all of a sudden\n\n15:53.300 --> 15:55.100\n is gonna feel like we have real presence.\n\n15:55.100 --> 15:57.820\n You can sort of look at how the human brain works\n\n15:57.820 --> 16:01.820\n and how we express and kind of read emotions\n\n16:01.820 --> 16:04.700\n and you can just build a roadmap of that,\n\n16:04.700 --> 16:06.460\n of just what are the most important things\n\n16:06.460 --> 16:08.520\n to try to unlock over a five to 10 year period\n\n16:08.520 --> 16:10.040\n and just try to make the experience\n\n16:10.040 --> 16:12.780\n more and more human and social.\n\n16:12.780 --> 16:16.640\n When do you think would be a moment,\n\n16:16.640 --> 16:19.340\n like a singularity moment for the Metaverse\n\n16:19.340 --> 16:22.300\n where there's a lot of ways to ask this question,\n\n16:22.300 --> 16:26.580\n but people will have many or most\n\n16:26.580 --> 16:28.820\n of their meaningful experiences\n\n16:28.820 --> 16:31.340\n in the Metaverse versus the real world.\n\n16:31.340 --> 16:33.060\n And actually it's interesting to think about\n\n16:33.060 --> 16:35.560\n the fact that a lot of people are having\n\n16:35.560 --> 16:37.280\n the most important moments of their life\n\n16:37.280 --> 16:39.100\n happen in the digital sphere,\n\n16:39.100 --> 16:40.540\n especially not during COVID,\n\n16:41.680 --> 16:45.060\n like even falling in love or meeting friends\n\n16:45.060 --> 16:46.420\n or getting excited about stuff\n\n16:46.420 --> 16:49.660\n that is happening on the 2D digital plane.\n\n16:49.660 --> 16:50.860\n When do you think the Metaverse\n\n16:50.860 --> 16:54.100\n will provide those experiences for a large number,\n\n16:54.100 --> 16:54.940\n like a majority of the population?\n\n16:54.940 --> 16:57.240\n Yeah, I think it's a really good question.\n\n16:57.240 --> 17:00.260\n There was someone, I read this piece\n\n17:00.260 --> 17:03.740\n that framed this as a lot of people think\n\n17:03.740 --> 17:06.040\n that the Metaverse is about a place,\n\n17:06.040 --> 17:10.380\n but one definition of this is it's about a time\n\n17:10.380 --> 17:12.900\n when basically immersive digital worlds\n\n17:12.900 --> 17:17.100\n become the primary way that we live our lives\n\n17:17.100 --> 17:18.720\n and spend our time.\n\n17:18.720 --> 17:20.160\n I think that that's a reasonable construct.\n\n17:20.160 --> 17:21.900\n And from that perspective,\n\n17:21.900 --> 17:25.540\n I think you also just wanna look at this as a continuation\n\n17:25.540 --> 17:27.140\n because it's not like, okay,\n\n17:27.140 --> 17:28.940\n we are building digital worlds,\n\n17:28.940 --> 17:29.820\n but we don't have that today.\n\n17:29.820 --> 17:32.340\n I think you and I probably already live\n\n17:32.340 --> 17:34.660\n a very large part of our life in digital worlds.\n\n17:34.660 --> 17:37.260\n They're just not 3D immersive virtual reality,\n\n17:37.260 --> 17:39.820\n but I do a lot of meetings over video\n\n17:39.820 --> 17:42.300\n or I spend a lot of time writing things over email\n\n17:42.300 --> 17:44.540\n or WhatsApp or whatever.\n\n17:44.540 --> 17:46.060\n So what is it gonna take to get there\n\n17:46.060 --> 17:48.700\n for kind of the immersive presence version of this,\n\n17:48.700 --> 17:51.060\n which I think is what you're asking.\n\n17:51.060 --> 17:52.940\n And for that, I think that there's just a bunch\n\n17:52.940 --> 17:54.540\n of different use cases.\n\n17:55.640 --> 18:00.460\n And I think when you're building technology,\n\n18:00.460 --> 18:05.460\n I think a lot of it is just you're managing this duality\n\n18:05.820 --> 18:06.980\n where on the one hand,\n\n18:06.980 --> 18:10.100\n you wanna build these elegant things that can scale\n\n18:10.100 --> 18:12.140\n and have billions of people use them\n\n18:12.140 --> 18:13.340\n and get value from them.\n\n18:13.340 --> 18:14.540\n And then on the other hand,\n\n18:14.540 --> 18:17.020\n you're fighting this kind of ground game\n\n18:17.020 --> 18:19.680\n where there are just a lot of different use cases\n\n18:19.680 --> 18:20.880\n and people do different things\n\n18:20.880 --> 18:22.260\n and you wanna be able to unlock them.\n\n18:22.260 --> 18:25.940\n So the first ones that we basically went after\n\n18:25.940 --> 18:30.340\n were gaming with Quest and social experiences.\n\n18:30.340 --> 18:32.540\n And it goes back to when we started working\n\n18:32.540 --> 18:33.380\n on virtual reality.\n\n18:33.380 --> 18:36.140\n My theory at the time was basically\n\n18:37.400 --> 18:39.440\n people thought about it as gaming,\n\n18:39.440 --> 18:44.160\n but if you look at all computing platforms up to that point,\n\n18:44.160 --> 18:47.440\n gaming is a huge part, it was a huge part of PCs,\n\n18:47.440 --> 18:49.460\n it was a huge part of mobile,\n\n18:49.460 --> 18:51.960\n but it was also very decentralized.\n\n18:51.960 --> 18:54.240\n There wasn't, for the most part,\n\n18:54.240 --> 18:55.660\n one or two gaming companies.\n\n18:55.660 --> 18:57.440\n There were a lot of gaming companies\n\n18:57.440 --> 18:58.700\n and gaming is somewhat hits based.\n\n18:58.700 --> 19:01.440\n I mean, we're getting some games that have more longevity,\n\n19:01.440 --> 19:05.340\n but in general, there were a lot of different games\n\n19:05.340 --> 19:06.560\n out there.\n\n19:06.560 --> 19:10.740\n But on PC and on mobile,\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:13.700\n the companies that focused on communication\n\n19:13.700 --> 19:15.100\n and social interaction,\n\n19:15.100 --> 19:17.260\n there tended to be a smaller number of those\n\n19:17.260 --> 19:19.160\n and that ended up being just as important of a thing\n\n19:19.160 --> 19:21.580\n as all of the games that you did combined.\n\n19:21.580 --> 19:23.140\n I think productivity is another area.\n\n19:23.140 --> 19:23.980\n That's obviously something\n\n19:23.980 --> 19:26.020\n that we've historically been less focused on,\n\n19:26.020 --> 19:27.220\n but I think it's gonna be really important for us.\n\n19:27.220 --> 19:29.580\n With workroom, do you mean productivity\n\n19:29.580 --> 19:30.860\n in the collaborative aspect?\n\n19:30.860 --> 19:34.360\n Yeah, I think that there's a workroom's aspect of this,\n\n19:34.360 --> 19:35.360\n like a meeting aspect,\n\n19:35.360 --> 19:39.500\n and then I think that there's like a Word, Excel,\n\n19:39.500 --> 19:42.940\n productivity, either you're working or coding\n\n19:42.940 --> 19:46.760\n or knowledge work as opposed to just meetings.\n\n19:46.760 --> 19:49.620\n So you can kind of go through all these different use cases.\n\n19:49.620 --> 19:51.280\n Gaming, I think we're well on our way.\n\n19:51.280 --> 19:56.080\n Social, I think we're just the kind of preeminent company\n\n19:56.080 --> 19:57.040\n that focuses on this.\n\n19:57.040 --> 20:00.420\n And I think that that's already on Quest becoming the,\n\n20:00.420 --> 20:03.460\n if you look at the list of what are the top apps,\n\n20:03.460 --> 20:06.460\n social apps are already number one, two, three.\n\n20:06.460 --> 20:10.860\n So that's kind of becoming a critical thing, but I don't know.\n\n20:10.860 --> 20:12.580\n I would imagine for someone like you,\n\n20:12.580 --> 20:17.580\n it'll be until we get a lot of the work things dialed in.\n\n20:17.980 --> 20:20.860\n When this is just like much more adopted\n\n20:20.860 --> 20:24.260\n and clearly better than Zoom for VC,\n\n20:24.260 --> 20:27.100\n when if you're doing your coding or your writing\n\n20:27.100 --> 20:29.420\n or whatever it is in VR,\n\n20:29.420 --> 20:31.260\n which it's not that far off to imagine that\n\n20:31.260 --> 20:32.660\n because pretty soon you're just gonna be able\n\n20:32.660 --> 20:34.220\n to have a screen that's bigger than,\n\n20:34.220 --> 20:36.140\n it'll be your ideal setup and you can bring it with you\n\n20:36.140 --> 20:37.540\n and put it on anywhere\n\n20:37.540 --> 20:39.780\n and have your kind of ideal workstation.\n\n20:39.780 --> 20:42.580\n So I think that there are a few things to work out on that,\n\n20:42.580 --> 20:46.940\n but I don't think that that's more than five years off.\n\n20:46.940 --> 20:48.120\n And then you'll get a bunch of other things\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:50.220\n that like aren't even possible\n\n20:50.220 --> 20:52.040\n or you don't even think about using a phone\n\n20:52.040 --> 20:54.440\n or PC for today, like fitness, right?\n\n20:54.440 --> 20:57.460\n So, I mean, I know you're, we were talking before\n\n20:57.460 --> 20:58.980\n about how you're into running\n\n20:58.980 --> 21:00.780\n and like I'm really into a lot of things\n\n21:00.780 --> 21:02.740\n around fitness as well,\n\n21:02.740 --> 21:04.100\n different things in different places.\n\n21:04.100 --> 21:06.060\n I got really into hydrofoiling recently\n\n21:06.060 --> 21:11.060\n and surfing and I used to fence competitively.\n\n21:12.420 --> 21:13.260\n I like run.\n\n21:13.260 --> 21:14.860\n So, and you were saying that you were thinking\n\n21:14.860 --> 21:16.380\n about trying different martial arts\n\n21:16.380 --> 21:18.180\n and I tried to trick you and convince you\n\n21:18.180 --> 21:19.940\n into doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\n21:19.940 --> 21:21.500\n Or you actually mentioned that that was one\n\n21:21.500 --> 21:23.220\n you're curious about and I don't know.\n\n21:23.220 --> 21:24.140\n Is that a trick?\n\n21:24.140 --> 21:25.140\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n21:26.020 --> 21:27.420\n We're in the metaverse now.\n\n21:27.420 --> 21:29.580\n Yeah, no, I took that seriously.\n\n21:29.580 --> 21:34.260\n I thought that that was a real suggestion.\n\n21:34.260 --> 21:36.380\n That would be an amazing chance\n\n21:36.380 --> 21:37.780\n if we ever step on the mat together\n\n21:37.780 --> 21:39.020\n and just like roll around.\n\n21:39.020 --> 21:40.100\n I'll show you some moves.\n\n21:40.100 --> 21:43.700\n Well, give me a year to train and then we can do it.\n\n21:43.700 --> 21:44.780\n You know, you've seen Rocky IV\n\n21:44.780 --> 21:46.340\n where the Russian faces off the American.\n\n21:46.340 --> 21:47.980\n I'm the Russian in this picture.\n\n21:47.980 --> 21:49.980\n And then you're the Rocky, the underdog\n\n21:49.980 --> 21:51.340\n that gets to win in the end.\n\n21:51.340 --> 21:56.180\n The idea of me as Rocky and like fighting is...\n\n21:56.180 --> 21:58.080\n If he dies, he dies.\n\n21:58.080 --> 22:00.740\n Sorry, I just had to.\n\n22:00.740 --> 22:01.580\n I mean.\n\n22:01.580 --> 22:02.640\n Anyway, yeah.\n\n22:02.640 --> 22:05.900\n But I mean, a lot of aspects of fitness.\n\n22:05.900 --> 22:08.780\n You know, I don't know if you've tried supernatural\n\n22:08.780 --> 22:10.180\n on Quest or...\n\n22:10.180 --> 22:12.060\n So first of all, can I just comment on the fact\n\n22:12.060 --> 22:15.020\n every time I played around with Quest 2,\n\n22:15.020 --> 22:18.780\n I just, I get giddy every time I step into virtual reality.\n\n22:18.780 --> 22:20.860\n So you mentioned productivity and all those kinds of things.\n\n22:20.860 --> 22:23.820\n That's definitely something I'm excited about,\n\n22:23.820 --> 22:26.780\n but really I just love the possibilities\n\n22:26.780 --> 22:28.820\n of stepping into that world.\n\n22:28.820 --> 22:30.460\n Maybe it's the introvert in me,\n\n22:30.460 --> 22:34.060\n but it just feels like the most convenient way\n\n22:34.060 --> 22:37.500\n to travel into worlds,\n\n22:37.500 --> 22:40.340\n into worlds that are similar to the real world\n\n22:40.340 --> 22:41.660\n or totally different.\n\n22:41.660 --> 22:42.860\n It's like Alice in Wonderland.\n\n22:42.860 --> 22:44.660\n Just try out crazy stuff.\n\n22:44.660 --> 22:45.780\n The possibilities are endless.\n\n22:45.780 --> 22:50.780\n And I just, I personally am just love,\n\n22:50.900 --> 22:53.980\n get excited for stepping in those virtual worlds.\n\n22:53.980 --> 22:55.020\n So I'm a huge fan.\n\n22:55.020 --> 22:58.300\n In terms of the productivity as a programmer,\n\n22:58.300 --> 23:00.060\n I spend most of my day programming.\n\n23:00.060 --> 23:01.980\n That's really interesting also,\n\n23:01.980 --> 23:04.340\n but then you have to develop the right IDEs.\n\n23:04.340 --> 23:07.380\n You have to develop, like there has to be a threshold\n\n23:07.380 --> 23:09.340\n where a large amount of the programming community\n\n23:09.340 --> 23:11.860\n moves there, but the collaborative aspects\n\n23:11.860 --> 23:14.260\n that are possible in terms of meetings,\n\n23:14.260 --> 23:18.380\n in terms of when two coders are working together,\n\n23:18.380 --> 23:21.740\n I mean, the possibilities there are super, super exciting.\n\n23:21.740 --> 23:25.840\n I think that in building this, we sort of need to balance.\n\n23:27.100 --> 23:28.160\n There are gonna be some new things\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:29.700\n that you just couldn't do before.\n\n23:29.700 --> 23:31.540\n And those are gonna be the amazing experiences.\n\n23:31.540 --> 23:33.420\n So teleporting to any place, right?\n\n23:33.420 --> 23:37.040\n Whether it's a real place or something that people made.\n\n23:38.620 --> 23:40.340\n And I mean, some of the experiences\n\n23:40.340 --> 23:42.100\n around how we can build stuff in new ways,\n\n23:42.100 --> 23:44.740\n where a lot of the stuff that,\n\n23:44.740 --> 23:46.060\n when I'm coding stuff, it's like, all right,\n\n23:46.060 --> 23:47.180\n you code it and then you build it\n\n23:47.180 --> 23:48.260\n and then you see it afterwards.\n\n23:48.260 --> 23:50.500\n But increasingly it's gonna be possible to,\n\n23:50.500 --> 23:52.780\n you're in a world and you're building the world\n\n23:52.780 --> 23:55.780\n as you are in it and kind of manipulating it.\n\n23:55.780 --> 23:59.900\n One of the things that we showed at our Inside the Lab\n\n23:59.900 --> 24:02.500\n for recent artificial intelligence progress\n\n24:02.500 --> 24:03.940\n is this Builder Bot program,\n\n24:03.940 --> 24:07.180\n where now you can just talk to it and say,\n\n24:07.180 --> 24:08.460\n hey, okay, I'm in this world,\n\n24:08.460 --> 24:10.740\n like put some trees over there and it'll do that.\n\n24:10.740 --> 24:13.220\n And like, all right, put some bottles of water\n\n24:13.220 --> 24:17.060\n on our picnic blanket and it'll do that\n\n24:17.060 --> 24:17.900\n and you're in the world.\n\n24:17.900 --> 24:19.940\n And I think there are gonna be new paradigms for coding.\n\n24:19.940 --> 24:22.100\n So yeah, there are gonna be some things\n\n24:22.100 --> 24:24.620\n that I think are just pretty amazing,\n\n24:24.620 --> 24:26.580\n especially the first few times that you do them,\n\n24:26.580 --> 24:28.300\n but that you're like, whoa,\n\n24:28.300 --> 24:30.620\n like I've never had an experience like this.\n\n24:30.620 --> 24:34.260\n But most of your life, I would imagine,\n\n24:34.260 --> 24:38.180\n is not doing things that are amazing for the first time.\n\n24:38.180 --> 24:39.620\n A lot of this in terms of,\n\n24:39.620 --> 24:42.020\n I mean, just answering your question from before around,\n\n24:42.020 --> 24:42.860\n what is it gonna take\n\n24:42.860 --> 24:45.060\n before you're spending most of your time in this?\n\n24:45.060 --> 24:48.180\n Well, first of all, let me just say it as an aside,\n\n24:48.180 --> 24:50.340\n the goal isn't to have people spend a lot more time\n\n24:50.340 --> 24:51.180\n in computing.\n\n24:51.180 --> 24:52.340\n It's to make it so that. I'm asking for myself.\n\n24:52.340 --> 24:54.460\n Yeah, it's to make it. When will I spend all my time in?\n\n24:54.460 --> 24:57.060\n Yeah, it's to make computing more natural.\n\n24:57.060 --> 25:02.060\n But I think you will spend most of your computing time\n\n25:02.740 --> 25:04.900\n in this when it does the things\n\n25:04.900 --> 25:07.300\n that you use computing for somewhat better.\n\n25:07.300 --> 25:10.540\n So maybe having your perfect workstation\n\n25:10.540 --> 25:15.140\n is a 5% improvement on your coding productivity.\n\n25:15.140 --> 25:18.420\n Maybe it's not like a completely new thing.\n\n25:19.300 --> 25:21.620\n But I mean, look, if I could increase the productivity\n\n25:21.620 --> 25:25.500\n of every engineer at Meta by 5%,\n\n25:25.500 --> 25:27.620\n we'd buy those devices for everyone.\n\n25:27.620 --> 25:30.340\n And I imagine a lot of other companies would too.\n\n25:30.340 --> 25:31.860\n And that's how you start getting to the scale\n\n25:31.860 --> 25:34.500\n that I think makes this rival\n\n25:34.500 --> 25:37.020\n some of the bigger computing platforms that exist today.\n\n25:37.020 --> 25:38.300\n Let me ask you about identity.\n\n25:38.300 --> 25:40.460\n We talked about the avatar.\n\n25:40.460 --> 25:42.740\n How do you see identity in the Metaverse?\n\n25:42.740 --> 25:46.420\n Should the avatar be tied to your identity\n\n25:46.420 --> 25:49.300\n or can I be anything in the Metaverse?\n\n25:49.300 --> 25:52.180\n Like, can I be whatever the heck I want?\n\n25:52.180 --> 25:53.660\n Can I even be a troll?\n\n25:53.660 --> 25:57.420\n So there's exciting freeing possibilities\n\n25:57.420 --> 25:59.420\n and there's the darker possibilities too.\n\n26:00.740 --> 26:03.180\n Yeah, I mean, I think that there's gonna be a range, right?\n\n26:03.180 --> 26:07.660\n So we're working on, for expression and avatars,\n\n26:10.180 --> 26:13.100\n on one end of the spectrum are kind of expressive\n\n26:13.100 --> 26:14.940\n and cartoonish avatars.\n\n26:14.940 --> 26:16.460\n And then on the other end of the spectrum\n\n26:16.460 --> 26:18.500\n are photorealistic avatars.\n\n26:18.500 --> 26:20.660\n And I just think the reality is\n\n26:20.660 --> 26:22.100\n that there are gonna be different use cases\n\n26:22.100 --> 26:23.260\n for different things.\n\n26:23.260 --> 26:25.140\n And I guess there's another axis.\n\n26:25.140 --> 26:28.700\n So if you're going from photorealistic to expressive,\n\n26:28.700 --> 26:31.100\n there's also like representing you directly\n\n26:31.100 --> 26:33.660\n versus like some fantasy identity.\n\n26:33.660 --> 26:35.340\n And I think that there are gonna be things\n\n26:35.340 --> 26:37.860\n on all ends of that spectrum too, right?\n\n26:37.860 --> 26:41.020\n So you'll want photo, like in some experience,\n\n26:41.020 --> 26:44.300\n you might wanna be like a photorealistic dragon, right?\n\n26:44.300 --> 26:46.980\n Or if I'm playing Onward,\n\n26:46.980 --> 26:48.980\n or just this military simulator game,\n\n26:50.940 --> 26:53.620\n I think getting to be more photorealistic as a soldier\n\n26:53.620 --> 26:56.740\n in that could enhance the experience.\n\n26:57.780 --> 26:59.540\n There are times when I'm hanging out with friends\n\n26:59.540 --> 27:02.060\n where I want them to know it's me.\n\n27:02.060 --> 27:06.180\n So a kind of cartoonish or expressive version of me is good.\n\n27:06.180 --> 27:09.580\n But there are also experiences like,\n\n27:09.580 --> 27:11.580\n VRChat does this well today,\n\n27:11.580 --> 27:14.900\n where a lot of the experience is kind of dressing up\n\n27:14.900 --> 27:17.780\n and wearing a fantastical avatar\n\n27:17.780 --> 27:19.580\n that's almost like a meme or is humorous.\n\n27:19.580 --> 27:21.300\n So you come into an experience\n\n27:21.300 --> 27:24.540\n and it's almost like you have like a built in icebreaker\n\n27:24.540 --> 27:27.300\n because like you see people and you're just like,\n\n27:27.300 --> 27:29.940\n all right, I'm cracking up at what you're wearing\n\n27:29.940 --> 27:30.780\n because that's funny.\n\n27:30.780 --> 27:31.900\n And it's just like, where'd you get that?\n\n27:31.900 --> 27:32.740\n Or, oh, you made that?\n\n27:32.740 --> 27:34.340\n That's, it's awesome.\n\n27:35.500 --> 27:38.900\n Whereas, okay, if you're going into a work meeting,\n\n27:38.900 --> 27:41.740\n maybe a photorealistic version of your real self\n\n27:41.740 --> 27:43.540\n is gonna be the most appropriate thing for that.\n\n27:43.540 --> 27:47.340\n So I think the reality is there aren't going to be,\n\n27:47.340 --> 27:48.940\n it's not just gonna be one thing.\n\n27:50.500 --> 27:54.380\n You know, my own sense of kind of how you wanna\n\n27:54.380 --> 27:56.860\n express identity online has sort of evolved over time.\n\n27:56.860 --> 27:58.620\n And that, you know, early days in Facebook,\n\n27:58.620 --> 28:00.260\n I thought, okay, people are gonna have one identity.\n\n28:00.260 --> 28:02.100\n And now I think that's clearly not gonna be the case.\n\n28:02.100 --> 28:04.420\n I think you're gonna have all these different things\n\n28:04.420 --> 28:07.300\n and there's utility in being able to do different things.\n\n28:07.300 --> 28:10.100\n So some of the technical challenges\n\n28:10.100 --> 28:12.140\n that I'm really interested in around it\n\n28:12.140 --> 28:14.180\n are how do you build the software\n\n28:14.180 --> 28:17.100\n to allow people to seamlessly go between them?\n\n28:17.100 --> 28:19.300\n So say, so you could view them\n\n28:19.300 --> 28:24.300\n as just completely discrete points on a spectrum,\n\n28:25.140 --> 28:28.500\n but let's talk about the metaverse economy for a second.\n\n28:28.500 --> 28:31.220\n Let's say I buy a digital shirt\n\n28:31.220 --> 28:34.420\n for my photorealistic avatar, which by the way,\n\n28:34.420 --> 28:36.460\n I think at the time where we're spending a lot of time\n\n28:36.460 --> 28:38.740\n in the metaverse doing a lot of our work meetings\n\n28:38.740 --> 28:40.260\n in the metaverse and et cetera,\n\n28:40.260 --> 28:42.460\n I would imagine that the economy around virtual clothing\n\n28:42.460 --> 28:44.660\n as an example is going to be quite as big.\n\n28:44.660 --> 28:47.100\n Why wouldn't I spend almost as much money\n\n28:47.100 --> 28:49.780\n in investing in my appearance or expression\n\n28:49.780 --> 28:52.420\n for my photorealistic avatar for meetings\n\n28:52.420 --> 28:55.540\n as I would for whatever I'm gonna wear in my video chat.\n\n28:55.540 --> 28:56.700\n But the question is, okay, so you,\n\n28:56.700 --> 28:57.620\n let's say you buy some shirt\n\n28:57.620 --> 28:59.780\n for your photorealistic avatar.\n\n28:59.780 --> 29:02.620\n Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way\n\n29:02.620 --> 29:07.620\n to basically translate that into a more expressive thing\n\n29:07.620 --> 29:11.220\n for your kind of cartoonish or expressive avatar?\n\n29:11.220 --> 29:12.580\n And there are multiple ways to do that.\n\n29:12.580 --> 29:14.940\n You can view them as two discrete points and okay,\n\n29:14.940 --> 29:18.220\n maybe if a designer sells one thing,\n\n29:18.220 --> 29:19.940\n then it actually comes in a pack and there's two\n\n29:19.940 --> 29:22.340\n and you can use either one on that,\n\n29:22.340 --> 29:24.420\n but I actually think this stuff might exist more\n\n29:24.420 --> 29:26.100\n as a spectrum in the future.\n\n29:26.100 --> 29:29.460\n And that's what I do think the direction\n\n29:29.460 --> 29:33.380\n on some of the AI advances that is happening\n\n29:33.380 --> 29:35.980\n to be able to, especially stuff around like style transfer,\n\n29:35.980 --> 29:39.860\n being able to take a piece of art or express something\n\n29:39.860 --> 29:44.860\n and say, okay, paint me this photo in the style of Gauguin\n\n29:44.900 --> 29:48.020\n or whoever it is that you're interested in.\n\n29:49.060 --> 29:51.300\n Take this shirt and put it in the style\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:53.820\n of what I've designed for my expressive avatar.\n\n29:55.220 --> 29:56.940\n I think that's gonna be pretty compelling.\n\n29:56.940 --> 30:00.060\n And so the fashion, you might be buying like a generator,\n\n30:00.060 --> 30:03.260\n like a closet that generates a style.\n\n30:03.260 --> 30:05.540\n And then like with the GANs,\n\n30:05.540 --> 30:08.180\n you'll be able to infinitely generate outfits\n\n30:08.180 --> 30:10.780\n thereby making it, so the reason I wear the same thing\n\n30:10.780 --> 30:12.380\n all the time is I don't like choice.\n\n30:12.380 --> 30:15.140\n You've talked about the same thing,\n\n30:15.140 --> 30:16.700\n but now you don't even have to choose.\n\n30:16.700 --> 30:19.580\n Your closet generates your outfit for you every time.\n\n30:19.580 --> 30:23.460\n So you have to live with the outfit it generates.\n\n30:23.460 --> 30:25.500\n I mean, you could do that, although,\n\n30:25.500 --> 30:27.500\n no, I think that that's, I think some people will,\n\n30:27.500 --> 30:31.300\n but I think like, I think there's going to be a huge aspect\n\n30:31.300 --> 30:35.900\n of just people doing creative commerce here.\n\n30:35.900 --> 30:37.860\n So I think that there is going to be a big market\n\n30:37.860 --> 30:41.060\n around people designing digital clothing.\n\n30:41.060 --> 30:43.020\n But the question is, if you're designing digital clothing,\n\n30:43.020 --> 30:44.860\n do you need to design, if you're the designer,\n\n30:44.860 --> 30:48.140\n do you need to make it for each kind of specific discrete\n\n30:48.140 --> 30:51.500\n point along a spectrum, or are you just designing it\n\n30:51.500 --> 30:54.140\n for kind of a photo realistic case or an expressive case,\n\n30:54.140 --> 30:55.140\n or can you design one\n\n30:55.140 --> 30:57.460\n and have it translate across these things?\n\n30:57.460 --> 31:01.780\n If I buy a style from a designer who I care about,\n\n31:01.780 --> 31:04.220\n and now I'm a dragon, is there a way to morph that\n\n31:04.220 --> 31:07.660\n so it goes on the dragon in a way that makes sense?\n\n31:07.660 --> 31:09.460\n And that I think is an interesting AI problem\n\n31:09.460 --> 31:10.820\n because you're probably not going to make it\n\n31:10.820 --> 31:14.700\n so that designers have to go design for all those things.\n\n31:14.700 --> 31:17.900\n But the more useful the digital content is that you buy\n\n31:17.900 --> 31:21.220\n in a lot of uses, in a lot of use cases,\n\n31:21.220 --> 31:23.420\n the more that economy will just explode.\n\n31:23.420 --> 31:28.100\n And that's a lot of what all of the,\n\n31:28.100 --> 31:29.700\n we were joking about NFTs before,\n\n31:29.700 --> 31:32.580\n but I think a lot of the promise here is that\n\n31:32.580 --> 31:35.020\n if the digital goods that you buy are not just tied\n\n31:35.020 --> 31:37.060\n to one platform or one use case,\n\n31:37.060 --> 31:38.260\n they end up being more valuable,\n\n31:38.260 --> 31:39.820\n which means that people are more willing\n\n31:39.820 --> 31:41.300\n and more likely to invest in them,\n\n31:41.300 --> 31:44.220\n and that just spurs the whole economy.\n\n31:44.220 --> 31:47.260\n But the question is, that's a fascinating positive aspect,\n\n31:47.260 --> 31:50.780\n but the potential negative aspect is that\n\n31:50.780 --> 31:52.660\n you can have people concealing their identity\n\n31:52.660 --> 31:57.060\n in order to troll or even not people, bots.\n\n31:57.060 --> 31:58.780\n So how do you know in the metaverse\n\n31:58.780 --> 32:02.060\n that you're talking to a real human or an AI\n\n32:02.060 --> 32:03.940\n or a well intentioned human?\n\n32:03.940 --> 32:04.980\n Is that something you think about,\n\n32:04.980 --> 32:06.940\n something you're concerned about?\n\n32:06.940 --> 32:10.260\n Well, let's break that down into a few different cases.\n\n32:10.260 --> 32:11.980\n I mean, because knowing that you're talking to someone\n\n32:11.980 --> 32:13.880\n who has good intentions is something that I think\n\n32:13.880 --> 32:17.860\n is not even solved in pretty much anywhere.\n\n32:17.860 --> 32:20.380\n But I mean, if you're talking to someone who's a dragon,\n\n32:20.380 --> 32:22.000\n I think it's pretty clear that they're not representing\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:23.300\n themselves as a person.\n\n32:23.300 --> 32:25.300\n I think probably the most pernicious thing\n\n32:25.300 --> 32:28.580\n that you want to solve for is,\n\n32:30.140 --> 32:32.300\n I think probably one of the scariest ones is\n\n32:32.300 --> 32:35.020\n how do you make sure that someone isn't impersonating you?\n\n32:35.020 --> 32:39.340\n So, okay, you're in a future version of this conversation,\n\n32:39.340 --> 32:41.700\n and we have photorealistic avatars,\n\n32:41.700 --> 32:43.320\n and we're doing this in work rooms\n\n32:43.320 --> 32:44.980\n or whatever the future version of that is,\n\n32:44.980 --> 32:48.860\n and someone walks in who looks like me.\n\n32:48.860 --> 32:50.300\n How do you know that that's me?\n\n32:50.300 --> 32:54.200\n And one of the things that we're thinking about\n\n32:54.200 --> 32:57.500\n is it's still a pretty big AI project\n\n32:57.500 --> 32:59.500\n to be able to generate photorealistic avatars\n\n32:59.500 --> 33:00.880\n that basically can like,\n\n33:00.880 --> 33:03.380\n they work like these codecs of you, right?\n\n33:03.380 --> 33:06.220\n So you kind of have a map from your headset\n\n33:06.220 --> 33:08.020\n and whatever sensors of what your body's actually doing,\n\n33:08.020 --> 33:11.180\n and it takes the model and it kind of displays it in VR.\n\n33:11.180 --> 33:12.660\n But there's a question, which is,\n\n33:12.660 --> 33:15.420\n should there be some sort of biometric security\n\n33:15.420 --> 33:18.220\n so that when I put on my VR headset\n\n33:18.220 --> 33:20.940\n or I'm going to go use that avatar,\n\n33:20.940 --> 33:24.340\n I need to first prove that I am that?\n\n33:24.340 --> 33:26.780\n And I think you probably are gonna want something like that.\n\n33:26.780 --> 33:31.120\n So as we're developing these technologies,\n\n33:31.120 --> 33:34.500\n we're also thinking about the security for things like that\n\n33:34.500 --> 33:37.060\n because people aren't gonna wanna be impersonated.\n\n33:37.060 --> 33:38.860\n That's a huge security issue.\n\n33:41.700 --> 33:42.900\n Then you just get the question\n\n33:42.900 --> 33:46.580\n of people hiding behind fake accounts\n\n33:46.580 --> 33:48.300\n to do malicious things,\n\n33:48.300 --> 33:51.020\n which is not gonna be unique to the metaverse,\n\n33:51.020 --> 33:56.020\n although certainly in a environment\n\n33:56.140 --> 33:57.300\n where it's more immersive\n\n33:57.300 --> 33:58.640\n and you have more of a sense of presence,\n\n33:58.640 --> 34:01.740\n it could be more painful.\n\n34:01.740 --> 34:03.140\n But this is obviously something\n\n34:03.140 --> 34:06.480\n that we've just dealt with for years\n\n34:06.480 --> 34:08.740\n in social media and the internet more broadly.\n\n34:08.740 --> 34:13.140\n And there, I think there have been a bunch of tactics\n\n34:13.140 --> 34:17.900\n that I think we've just evolved to,\n\n34:17.900 --> 34:20.480\n we've built up these different AI systems\n\n34:20.480 --> 34:21.880\n to basically get a sense of,\n\n34:21.880 --> 34:26.340\n is this account behaving in the way that a person would?\n\n34:26.340 --> 34:28.340\n And it turns out,\n\n34:28.340 --> 34:31.940\n so in all of the work that we've done around,\n\n34:31.940 --> 34:33.340\n we call it community integrity\n\n34:33.340 --> 34:36.920\n and it's basically like policing harmful content\n\n34:36.920 --> 34:38.340\n and trying to figure out where to draw the line.\n\n34:38.340 --> 34:39.800\n And there are all these like really hard\n\n34:39.800 --> 34:41.300\n and philosophical questions around like,\n\n34:41.300 --> 34:42.880\n where do you draw the line on some of this stuff?\n\n34:42.880 --> 34:47.820\n And the thing that I've kind of found the most effective\n\n34:47.820 --> 34:51.260\n is as much as possible trying to figure out\n\n34:51.260 --> 34:53.380\n who are the inauthentic accounts\n\n34:53.380 --> 34:55.540\n or where are the accounts that are behaving\n\n34:55.540 --> 34:58.420\n in an overall harmful way at the account level,\n\n34:58.420 --> 35:00.460\n rather than trying to get into like policing\n\n35:00.460 --> 35:01.420\n what they're saying, right?\n\n35:01.420 --> 35:03.700\n Which I think the metaverse is gonna be even harder\n\n35:03.700 --> 35:07.320\n because the metaverse I think will have more properties of,\n\n35:07.320 --> 35:09.220\n it's almost more like a phone call, right?\n\n35:09.220 --> 35:12.380\n Or it's not like I post a piece of content\n\n35:12.380 --> 35:14.700\n and is that piece of content good or bad?\n\n35:14.700 --> 35:16.260\n So I think more of this stuff will have to be done\n\n35:16.260 --> 35:19.420\n at the level of the account.\n\n35:19.420 --> 35:21.740\n But this is the area where,\n\n35:21.740 --> 35:26.740\n between the kind of counter intelligence teams\n\n35:27.140 --> 35:28.480\n that we built up inside the company\n\n35:28.480 --> 35:33.220\n and like years of building just different AI systems\n\n35:33.220 --> 35:36.900\n to basically detect what is a real account and what isn't.\n\n35:36.900 --> 35:37.940\n I'm not saying we're perfect,\n\n35:37.940 --> 35:39.920\n but like this is an area where I just think\n\n35:39.920 --> 35:43.580\n we are like years ahead of basically anyone else\n\n35:43.580 --> 35:48.100\n in the industry in terms of having built those capabilities.\n\n35:48.100 --> 35:50.180\n And I think that that just is gonna be incredibly important\n\n35:50.180 --> 35:51.540\n for this next wave of things.\n\n35:51.540 --> 35:53.460\n And like you said, on a technical level,\n\n35:53.460 --> 35:54.980\n on a philosophical level,\n\n35:54.980 --> 35:57.700\n it's an incredibly difficult problem to solve.\n\n35:59.260 --> 36:03.220\n By the way, I would probably like to open source my avatar\n\n36:03.220 --> 36:05.940\n so there could be like millions of Lexis walking around\n\n36:05.940 --> 36:07.040\n just like an army.\n\n36:07.040 --> 36:08.500\n Like Agent Smith?\n\n36:08.500 --> 36:10.700\n Agent Smith, yeah, exactly.\n\n36:10.700 --> 36:15.700\n So the Unity ML folks built a copy of me\n\n36:16.420 --> 36:18.420\n and they sent it to me.\n\n36:18.420 --> 36:20.220\n So there's a person running around\n\n36:20.220 --> 36:22.500\n and I've just been doing reinforcement learning on it.\n\n36:22.500 --> 36:23.820\n I was gonna release it\n\n36:25.420 --> 36:29.860\n because just to have sort of like thousands of Lexis\n\n36:29.860 --> 36:31.180\n doing reinforcement.\n\n36:31.180 --> 36:32.460\n So they fall over naturally,\n\n36:32.460 --> 36:34.900\n they have to learn how to like walk around and stuff.\n\n36:34.900 --> 36:36.660\n So I love that idea,\n\n36:36.660 --> 36:39.140\n this tension between biometric security,\n\n36:39.140 --> 36:40.340\n you want to have one identity,\n\n36:40.340 --> 36:43.620\n but then certain avatars, you might have to have many.\n\n36:43.620 --> 36:45.400\n I don't know which is better security,\n\n36:45.400 --> 36:48.140\n sort of flooding the world with Lexis\n\n36:48.140 --> 36:49.440\n and thereby achieving security\n\n36:49.440 --> 36:51.780\n or really being protective of your identity.\n\n36:51.780 --> 36:53.860\n I have to ask you a security question actually.\n\n36:53.860 --> 36:56.860\n Well, how does flooding the world with Lexis help me know\n\n36:56.860 --> 36:59.640\n in our conversation that I'm talking to the real Lex?\n\n36:59.640 --> 37:01.580\n I completely destroy the trust\n\n37:01.580 --> 37:03.060\n in all my relationships then, right?\n\n37:03.060 --> 37:04.180\n If I flood,\n\n37:04.180 --> 37:06.700\n cause then it's, yeah, that.\n\n37:07.820 --> 37:09.500\n I think that one's not gonna work that well for you.\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:11.860\n It's not gonna work that well for the original copy.\n\n37:11.860 --> 37:13.380\n It probably fits some things.\n\n37:13.380 --> 37:14.820\n Like if you're a public figure\n\n37:14.820 --> 37:18.500\n and you're trying to have a bunch of,\n\n37:18.500 --> 37:19.480\n if you're trying to show up\n\n37:19.480 --> 37:21.060\n in a bunch of different places in the future,\n\n37:21.060 --> 37:23.500\n you'll be able to do that in the metaverse.\n\n37:23.500 --> 37:26.260\n So that kind of replication I think will be useful.\n\n37:26.260 --> 37:29.260\n But I do think that you're gonna want a notion of like,\n\n37:29.260 --> 37:31.500\n I am talking to the real one.\n\n37:31.500 --> 37:32.700\n Yeah.\n\n37:32.700 --> 37:35.660\n Yeah, especially if the fake ones start outperforming you\n\n37:35.660 --> 37:37.460\n and all your private relationships\n\n37:37.460 --> 37:38.740\n and then you're left behind.\n\n37:38.740 --> 37:41.060\n I mean, that's a serious concern I have with clones.\n\n37:41.060 --> 37:43.340\n Again, the things I think about.\n\n37:43.340 --> 37:48.340\n Okay, so I recently got, I use QNAP NAS storage.\n\n37:48.380 --> 37:50.220\n So just storage for video and stuff.\n\n37:50.220 --> 37:51.460\n And I recently got hacked.\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:53.540\n This is the first time for me with ransomware.\n\n37:53.540 --> 37:56.580\n It's not me personally, it's all QNAP devices.\n\n37:58.700 --> 38:00.780\n So the question that people have\n\n38:00.780 --> 38:03.300\n is about security in general.\n\n38:03.300 --> 38:05.060\n Because I was doing a lot of the right things\n\n38:05.060 --> 38:06.820\n in terms of security and nevertheless,\n\n38:06.820 --> 38:10.940\n ransomware basically disabled my device.\n\n38:10.940 --> 38:12.060\n Is that something you think about?\n\n38:12.060 --> 38:13.780\n What are the different steps you could take\n\n38:13.780 --> 38:16.940\n to protect people's data on the security front?\n\n38:16.940 --> 38:20.440\n I think that there's different solutions for,\n\n38:21.380 --> 38:23.660\n and strategies where it makes sense to have stuff\n\n38:23.660 --> 38:25.460\n kind of put behind a fortress, right?\n\n38:25.460 --> 38:30.220\n So the centralized model versus the decentralizing.\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:32.140\n Then I think both have strengths and weaknesses.\n\n38:32.140 --> 38:33.260\n So I think anyone who says, okay,\n\n38:33.260 --> 38:36.660\n just decentralize everything, that'll make it more secure.\n\n38:36.660 --> 38:38.980\n I think that that's tough because,\n\n38:38.980 --> 38:42.740\n I mean, the advantage of something like encryption\n\n38:42.740 --> 38:46.420\n is that we run the largest encrypted service\n\n38:46.420 --> 38:47.700\n in the world with WhatsApp.\n\n38:47.700 --> 38:49.580\n And we're one of the first to roll out\n\n38:49.580 --> 38:52.660\n a multi platform encryption service.\n\n38:52.660 --> 38:55.980\n And that's something that I think was a big advance\n\n38:55.980 --> 38:57.180\n for the industry.\n\n38:57.180 --> 38:59.300\n And one of the promises that we can basically make\n\n38:59.300 --> 39:02.260\n because of that, our company doesn't see\n\n39:02.260 --> 39:04.500\n when you're sending an encrypted message\n\n39:04.500 --> 39:05.860\n and to an encrypted message,\n\n39:05.860 --> 39:07.860\n what the content is of what you're sharing.\n\n39:07.860 --> 39:10.600\n So that way, if someone hacks Meta servers,\n\n39:11.540 --> 39:14.700\n they're not gonna be able to access the WhatsApp message\n\n39:14.700 --> 39:16.940\n that you're sending to your friend.\n\n39:16.940 --> 39:19.100\n And that I think matters a lot to people\n\n39:19.100 --> 39:21.900\n because obviously if someone is able to compromise\n\n39:21.900 --> 39:23.900\n a company's servers and that company has hundreds\n\n39:23.900 --> 39:25.220\n of millions or billions of people,\n\n39:25.220 --> 39:27.900\n then that ends up being a very big deal.\n\n39:27.900 --> 39:29.380\n The flip side of that is, okay,\n\n39:29.380 --> 39:31.100\n all the content is on your phone.\n\n39:32.900 --> 39:35.860\n Are you following security best practices on your phone?\n\n39:35.860 --> 39:38.060\n If you lose your phone, all your content is gone.\n\n39:38.060 --> 39:39.620\n So that's an issue.\n\n39:39.620 --> 39:42.300\n Maybe you go back up your content from WhatsApp\n\n39:42.300 --> 39:45.740\n or some other service in an iCloud or something,\n\n39:45.740 --> 39:47.940\n but then you're just at Apple's whims about,\n\n39:47.940 --> 39:51.920\n are they gonna go turn over the data to some government\n\n39:51.920 --> 39:53.380\n or are they gonna get hacked?\n\n39:53.380 --> 39:57.340\n So a lot of the time it is useful to have data\n\n39:57.340 --> 40:00.580\n in a centralized place too because then you can train\n\n40:00.580 --> 40:04.740\n systems that can just do much better personalization.\n\n40:04.740 --> 40:08.580\n I think that in a lot of cases, centralized systems\n\n40:08.580 --> 40:13.460\n can offer, especially if you're a serious company,\n\n40:13.460 --> 40:16.020\n you're running the state of the art stuff\n\n40:16.020 --> 40:19.540\n and you have red teams attacking your own stuff\n\n40:19.540 --> 40:24.260\n and you're putting out bounty programs\n\n40:24.260 --> 40:26.260\n and trying to attract some of the best hackers in the world\n\n40:26.260 --> 40:27.820\n to go break into your stuff all the time.\n\n40:27.820 --> 40:30.500\n So any system is gonna have security issues,\n\n40:30.500 --> 40:34.340\n but I think the best way forward is to basically try\n\n40:34.340 --> 40:36.460\n to be as aggressive and open about hardening\n\n40:36.460 --> 40:39.140\n the systems as possible, not trying to kind of hide\n\n40:39.140 --> 40:40.740\n and pretend that there aren't gonna be issues,\n\n40:40.740 --> 40:43.820\n which I think is over time why a lot of open source systems\n\n40:43.820 --> 40:46.540\n have gotten relatively more secure is because they're open\n\n40:46.540 --> 40:48.740\n and it's not, rather than pretending that there aren't\n\n40:48.740 --> 40:50.900\n gonna be issues, just people surface them quicker.\n\n40:50.900 --> 40:53.760\n So I think you want to adopt that approach as a company\n\n40:53.760 --> 40:56.640\n and just constantly be hardening yourself.\n\n40:56.640 --> 41:00.080\n Trying to stay one step ahead of the attackers.\n\n41:01.060 --> 41:03.940\n It's an inherently adversarial space.\n\n41:03.940 --> 41:07.260\n I think it's an interesting security is interesting\n\n41:07.260 --> 41:09.140\n because of the different kind of threats\n\n41:09.140 --> 41:11.820\n that we've managed over the last five years,\n\n41:11.820 --> 41:15.540\n there are ones where basically the adversaries\n\n41:15.540 --> 41:16.820\n keep on getting better and better.\n\n41:16.820 --> 41:21.580\n So trying to kind of interfere with security\n\n41:21.580 --> 41:23.100\n is certainly one area of this.\n\n41:23.100 --> 41:24.860\n If you have nation states that are trying\n\n41:24.860 --> 41:27.300\n to interfere in elections or something,\n\n41:27.300 --> 41:29.460\n they're kind of evolving their tactics.\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:32.780\n Whereas on the other hand, I don't want to be too simplistic\n\n41:32.780 --> 41:36.660\n about it, but if someone is saying something hateful,\n\n41:36.660 --> 41:38.700\n people usually aren't getting smarter and smarter\n\n41:38.700 --> 41:40.460\n about how they say hateful things.\n\n41:40.460 --> 41:42.600\n So maybe there's some element of that,\n\n41:42.600 --> 41:44.820\n but it's a very small dynamic compared\n\n41:44.820 --> 41:48.520\n to how advanced attackers and some of these other places\n\n41:48.520 --> 41:49.980\n get over time.\n\n41:49.980 --> 41:51.360\n I believe most people are good,\n\n41:51.360 --> 41:53.660\n so they actually get better over time\n\n41:53.660 --> 41:55.420\n and not being less hateful\n\n41:55.420 --> 41:59.100\n because they realize it's not fun being hateful.\n\n42:00.060 --> 42:01.980\n That's at least the belief I have.\n\n42:01.980 --> 42:04.940\n But first, bathroom break.\n\n42:04.940 --> 42:05.800\n Sure, okay.\n\n42:06.840 --> 42:08.180\n So we'll come back to AI,\n\n42:08.180 --> 42:11.020\n but let me ask some difficult questions now.\n\n42:11.020 --> 42:13.820\n Social Dilemma is a popular documentary\n\n42:13.820 --> 42:15.500\n that raised concerns about the effects\n\n42:15.500 --> 42:17.540\n of social media on society.\n\n42:17.540 --> 42:20.820\n You responded with a point by point rebuttal titled,\n\n42:20.820 --> 42:23.120\n What the Social Dilemma Gets Wrong.\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:24.980\n People should read that.\n\n42:24.980 --> 42:26.700\n I would say the key point they make\n\n42:26.700 --> 42:29.580\n is because social media is funded by ads,\n\n42:29.580 --> 42:33.280\n algorithms want to maximize attention and engagement\n\n42:33.280 --> 42:38.020\n and an effective way to do so is to get people angry\n\n42:38.020 --> 42:40.940\n at each other, increase division and so on.\n\n42:40.940 --> 42:44.260\n Can you steel man their criticisms and arguments\n\n42:44.260 --> 42:46.260\n that they make in the documentary\n\n42:46.260 --> 42:48.580\n as a way to understand the concern\n\n42:48.580 --> 42:51.580\n and as a way to respond to it?\n\n42:53.060 --> 42:56.860\n Well, yeah, I think that's a good conversation to have.\n\n42:56.860 --> 43:00.420\n I don't happen to agree with the conclusions\n\n43:00.420 --> 43:02.100\n and I think that they make a few assumptions\n\n43:02.100 --> 43:06.300\n that are just very big jumps\n\n43:06.300 --> 43:08.880\n that I don't think are reasonable to make.\n\n43:08.880 --> 43:13.880\n But I understand overall why people would be concerned\n\n43:13.880 --> 43:18.880\n that our business model and ads in general,\n\n43:19.380 --> 43:20.640\n we do make more money\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:23.280\n as people use the service more in general, right?\n\n43:23.280 --> 43:26.680\n So as a kind of basic assumption, okay,\n\n43:26.680 --> 43:29.400\n do we have an incentive for people to build a service\n\n43:29.400 --> 43:31.200\n that people use more?\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:32.840\n Yes, on a lot of levels.\n\n43:32.840 --> 43:34.480\n I mean, we think what we're doing is good.\n\n43:34.480 --> 43:37.140\n So we think that if people are finding it useful,\n\n43:37.140 --> 43:38.560\n they'll use it more.\n\n43:38.560 --> 43:41.320\n Or if you just look at it as this sort of,\n\n43:41.320 --> 43:43.280\n if the only thing we cared about is money,\n\n43:43.280 --> 43:46.200\n which is not for anyone who knows me,\n\n43:46.200 --> 43:47.820\n but okay, we're a company.\n\n43:47.820 --> 43:51.360\n So let's say you just kind of simplified it down to that,\n\n43:51.360 --> 43:53.840\n then would we want people to use the services more?\n\n43:53.840 --> 43:57.240\n Yes, and then you get to the second question,\n\n43:57.240 --> 44:01.840\n which is does kind of getting people agitated\n\n44:02.920 --> 44:07.480\n make them more likely to use the services more?\n\n44:07.480 --> 44:12.480\n And I think from looking at other media in the world,\n\n44:12.480 --> 44:17.280\n especially TV, and there's the old news adage,\n\n44:17.280 --> 44:18.680\n if it bleeds, it leads.\n\n44:18.680 --> 44:20.020\n Like I think that this is,\n\n44:20.020 --> 44:25.020\n there are a bunch of reasons why someone might think\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:30.520\n that that kind of provocative content\n\n44:30.520 --> 44:32.640\n would be the most engaging.\n\n44:32.640 --> 44:35.640\n Now, what I've always found is two things.\n\n44:35.640 --> 44:39.180\n One is that what grabs someone's attention in the near term\n\n44:39.180 --> 44:40.840\n is not necessarily something\n\n44:40.840 --> 44:43.640\n that they're going to appreciate having seen\n\n44:43.640 --> 44:45.320\n or going to be the best over the long term.\n\n44:45.320 --> 44:47.460\n So I think what a lot of people get wrong\n\n44:47.460 --> 44:50.400\n is that I'm not building this company\n\n44:50.400 --> 44:53.300\n to make the most money or get people to spend the most time\n\n44:53.300 --> 44:55.760\n on this in the next quarter or the next year.\n\n44:55.760 --> 44:58.980\n I've been doing this for 17 years at this point,\n\n44:58.980 --> 45:00.380\n and I'm still relatively young,\n\n45:00.380 --> 45:02.040\n and I have a lot more that I wanna do\n\n45:02.040 --> 45:03.380\n over the coming decades.\n\n45:03.380 --> 45:08.380\n So I think that it's too simplistic to say,\n\n45:08.380 --> 45:11.820\n hey, this might increase time in the near term,\n\n45:11.820 --> 45:13.440\n therefore, it's what you're gonna do.\n\n45:13.440 --> 45:15.340\n Because I actually think a deeper look\n\n45:15.340 --> 45:17.240\n at kind of what my incentives are,\n\n45:17.240 --> 45:18.300\n the incentives of a company\n\n45:18.300 --> 45:20.540\n that are focused on the long term,\n\n45:20.540 --> 45:22.720\n is to basically do what people\n\n45:22.720 --> 45:24.160\n are gonna find valuable over time,\n\n45:24.160 --> 45:26.780\n not what is gonna draw people's attention today.\n\n45:26.780 --> 45:28.620\n The other thing that I'd say is that,\n\n45:29.980 --> 45:31.500\n I think a lot of times people look at this\n\n45:31.500 --> 45:33.100\n from the perspective of media\n\n45:34.580 --> 45:37.780\n or kind of information or civic discourse,\n\n45:37.780 --> 45:40.860\n but one other way of looking at this is just that,\n\n45:40.860 --> 45:42.540\n okay, I'm a product designer, right?\n\n45:42.540 --> 45:45.180\n Our company, we build products,\n\n45:45.180 --> 45:47.340\n and a big part of building a product\n\n45:47.340 --> 45:49.020\n is not just the function and utility\n\n45:49.020 --> 45:50.180\n of what you're delivering,\n\n45:50.180 --> 45:52.020\n but the feeling of how it feels, right?\n\n45:52.020 --> 45:55.660\n And we spend a lot of time talking about virtual reality\n\n45:55.660 --> 45:58.820\n and how the kind of key aspect of that experience\n\n45:58.820 --> 46:01.980\n is the feeling of presence, which it's a visceral thing.\n\n46:01.980 --> 46:03.940\n It's not just about the utility that you're delivering,\n\n46:03.940 --> 46:05.940\n it's about like the sensation.\n\n46:05.940 --> 46:10.420\n And similarly, I care a lot about how people feel\n\n46:10.420 --> 46:11.420\n when they use our products,\n\n46:11.420 --> 46:15.300\n and I don't want to build products that make people angry.\n\n46:15.300 --> 46:17.020\n I mean, that's like not, I think,\n\n46:17.020 --> 46:18.460\n what we're here on this earth to do,\n\n46:18.460 --> 46:22.180\n is to build something that people spend a bunch of time doing\n\n46:22.180 --> 46:24.020\n and it just kind of makes them angrier at other people.\n\n46:24.020 --> 46:26.300\n I mean, I think that that's not good.\n\n46:26.300 --> 46:28.740\n That's not what I think would be\n\n46:30.120 --> 46:32.040\n sort of a good use of our time\n\n46:32.040 --> 46:33.660\n or a good contribution to the world.\n\n46:33.660 --> 46:36.500\n So, okay, it's like people, they tell us\n\n46:36.500 --> 46:39.220\n on a per content basis, does this thing,\n\n46:39.220 --> 46:40.060\n do I like it?\n\n46:40.060 --> 46:40.880\n Do I love it?\n\n46:40.880 --> 46:41.720\n Does it make me angry?\n\n46:41.720 --> 46:42.980\n Does it make me sad?\n\n46:42.980 --> 46:47.220\n And based on that, we choose to basically show content\n\n46:47.220 --> 46:49.180\n that makes people angry less,\n\n46:49.180 --> 46:52.720\n because of course, if you're designing a product\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:56.320\n and you want people to be able to connect\n\n46:56.320 --> 46:59.180\n and feel good over a long period of time,\n\n46:59.180 --> 47:02.080\n then that's naturally what you're gonna do.\n\n47:02.080 --> 47:04.380\n So, I don't know, I think overall,\n\n47:06.580 --> 47:10.540\n I understand at a high level,\n\n47:10.540 --> 47:13.680\n if you're not thinking too deeply about it,\n\n47:13.680 --> 47:16.100\n why that argument might be appealing.\n\n47:16.100 --> 47:19.220\n But I just think if you actually look\n\n47:19.220 --> 47:20.940\n at what our real incentives are,\n\n47:20.940 --> 47:25.100\n not just like if we were trying to optimize\n\n47:25.100 --> 47:26.820\n for the next week,\n\n47:26.820 --> 47:28.980\n but like as people working on this,\n\n47:28.980 --> 47:30.480\n like why are we here?\n\n47:30.480 --> 47:32.900\n And I think it's pretty clear\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:34.300\n that that's not actually how you would wanna\n\n47:34.300 --> 47:35.740\n design the system.\n\n47:35.740 --> 47:37.780\n I guess one other thing that I'd say is that,\n\n47:37.780 --> 47:40.820\n while we're focused on the ads business model,\n\n47:40.820 --> 47:43.400\n I do think it's important to note that a lot\n\n47:43.400 --> 47:45.380\n of these issues are not unique to ads.\n\n47:45.380 --> 47:47.900\n I mean, so take like a subscription news business model,\n\n47:47.900 --> 47:50.920\n for example, I think that has just as many\n\n47:50.920 --> 47:52.220\n potential pitfalls.\n\n47:53.180 --> 47:55.240\n Maybe if someone's paying for a subscription,\n\n47:55.240 --> 47:57.940\n you don't get paid per piece of content that they look at,\n\n47:57.940 --> 48:02.640\n but say for example, I think like a bunch\n\n48:02.640 --> 48:06.180\n of the partisanship that we see could potentially\n\n48:06.180 --> 48:10.820\n be made worse by you have these kind of partisan\n\n48:12.620 --> 48:15.740\n news organizations that basically sell subscriptions\n\n48:15.740 --> 48:17.580\n and they're only gonna get people on one side\n\n48:17.580 --> 48:19.900\n to basically subscribe to them.\n\n48:19.900 --> 48:22.780\n So their incentive is not to print content\n\n48:22.780 --> 48:26.100\n or produce content that's kind of centrist\n\n48:26.100 --> 48:27.820\n or down the line either.\n\n48:27.820 --> 48:30.060\n I bet that what a lot of them find is that\n\n48:30.060 --> 48:32.480\n if they produce stuff that's kind of more polarizing\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:35.460\n or more partisan, then that is what gets\n\n48:35.460 --> 48:36.860\n the more subscribers.\n\n48:36.860 --> 48:40.260\n So I think that this stuff is all,\n\n48:40.260 --> 48:41.940\n there's no perfect business model.\n\n48:41.940 --> 48:43.460\n Everything has pitfalls.\n\n48:44.340 --> 48:46.500\n The thing that I think is great about advertising\n\n48:46.500 --> 48:48.740\n is it makes it so the consumer service is free,\n\n48:48.740 --> 48:50.860\n which if you believe that everyone should have a voice\n\n48:50.860 --> 48:52.020\n and everyone should be able to connect,\n\n48:52.020 --> 48:55.000\n then that's a great thing, as opposed to building\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.240\n a luxury service that not everyone can afford.\n\n48:57.240 --> 49:00.020\n But look, every business model, you have to be careful\n\n49:00.020 --> 49:02.500\n about how you're implementing what you're doing.\n\n49:02.500 --> 49:04.620\n You responded to a few things there.\n\n49:04.620 --> 49:07.260\n You spoke to the fact that there is a narrative\n\n49:07.260 --> 49:12.260\n of malevolence, like you're leaning into them,\n\n49:12.420 --> 49:15.020\n making people angry just because it makes more money\n\n49:15.020 --> 49:16.300\n in the short term, that kind of thing.\n\n49:16.300 --> 49:17.880\n So you responded to that.\n\n49:17.880 --> 49:22.060\n But there's also kind of reality of human nature.\n\n49:22.060 --> 49:25.380\n Just like you spoke about, there's fights,\n\n49:25.380 --> 49:28.700\n arguments we get in and we don't like ourselves afterwards,\n\n49:28.700 --> 49:30.340\n but we got into them anyway.\n\n49:30.340 --> 49:34.540\n So our longterm growth is, I believe for most of us,\n\n49:34.540 --> 49:38.220\n has to do with learning, challenging yourself,\n\n49:38.220 --> 49:40.960\n improving, being kind to each other,\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:45.960\n finding a community of people that you connect with\n\n49:47.620 --> 49:50.520\n on a real human level, all that kind of stuff.\n\n49:50.520 --> 49:54.660\n But it does seem when you look at social media\n\n49:54.660 --> 49:56.540\n that a lot of fights break out,\n\n49:56.540 --> 49:58.180\n a lot of arguments break out,\n\n49:58.180 --> 50:03.020\n a lot of viral content ends up being sort of outrage\n\n50:03.020 --> 50:04.820\n in one direction or the other.\n\n50:04.820 --> 50:08.020\n And so it's easy from that to infer the narrative\n\n50:08.020 --> 50:11.220\n that social media companies are letting\n\n50:11.220 --> 50:13.940\n this outrage become viral.\n\n50:13.940 --> 50:16.820\n And so they're increasing the division in the world.\n\n50:16.820 --> 50:18.820\n I mean, perhaps you can comment on that\n\n50:18.820 --> 50:21.140\n or further, how can you be,\n\n50:21.140 --> 50:25.780\n how can you push back on this narrative?\n\n50:25.780 --> 50:28.420\n How can you be transparent about this battle?\n\n50:28.420 --> 50:33.420\n Because I think it's not just motivation or financials,\n\n50:33.540 --> 50:36.000\n it's a technical problem too,\n\n50:36.000 --> 50:41.020\n which is how do you improve longterm wellbeing\n\n50:41.020 --> 50:43.020\n of human beings?\n\n50:43.020 --> 50:47.940\n I think that going through some of the design decisions\n\n50:47.940 --> 50:49.660\n would be a good conversation.\n\n50:49.660 --> 50:51.780\n But first, I actually think,\n\n50:51.780 --> 50:54.260\n I think you acknowledged that,\n\n50:54.260 --> 50:56.900\n that narrative is somewhat anecdotal.\n\n50:56.900 --> 50:59.500\n And I think it's worth grounding this conversation\n\n50:59.500 --> 51:02.600\n in the actual research that has been done on this,\n\n51:02.600 --> 51:07.600\n which by and large finds that social media\n\n51:07.980 --> 51:10.780\n is not a large driver of polarization, right?\n\n51:10.780 --> 51:14.820\n And, I mean, there's been a number of economists\n\n51:14.820 --> 51:18.380\n and social scientists and folks who have studied this.\n\n51:18.380 --> 51:21.220\n In a lot of polarization, it varies around the world.\n\n51:21.220 --> 51:23.100\n If social media is basically in every country,\n\n51:23.100 --> 51:24.580\n Facebook's in pretty much every country\n\n51:24.580 --> 51:27.180\n except for China and maybe North Korea.\n\n51:27.180 --> 51:32.180\n And you see different trends in different places\n\n51:32.460 --> 51:37.000\n where in a lot of countries polarization is declining,\n\n51:37.000 --> 51:41.660\n in some it's flat, in the US it's risen sharply.\n\n51:41.660 --> 51:44.660\n So the question is, what are the unique phenomenon\n\n51:44.660 --> 51:45.980\n in the different places?\n\n51:45.980 --> 51:47.580\n And I think for the people who are trying to say,\n\n51:47.580 --> 51:50.220\n hey, social media is the thing that's doing this.\n\n51:50.220 --> 51:52.940\n I think that that clearly doesn't hold up\n\n51:52.940 --> 51:54.480\n because social media is a phenomenon\n\n51:54.480 --> 51:56.020\n that is pretty much equivalent\n\n51:56.020 --> 51:57.740\n in all of these different countries.\n\n51:57.740 --> 52:00.600\n And you have researchers like this economist at Stanford,\n\n52:00.600 --> 52:04.400\n Matthew Genskow, who has just written at length about this.\n\n52:05.300 --> 52:10.300\n And it's a bunch of books by political scientists,\n\n52:10.420 --> 52:13.060\n Ezra Klein and folks, why we're polarized,\n\n52:13.060 --> 52:17.100\n basically goes through this decades long analysis in the US.\n\n52:17.100 --> 52:19.500\n Before I was born, basically talking about\n\n52:19.500 --> 52:22.780\n some of the forces in kind of partisan politics\n\n52:22.780 --> 52:25.160\n and Fox News and different things\n\n52:25.160 --> 52:27.640\n that predate the internet in a lot of ways\n\n52:27.640 --> 52:30.100\n that I think are likely larger contributors.\n\n52:30.100 --> 52:32.220\n So to the contrary on this,\n\n52:32.220 --> 52:35.340\n not only is it pretty clear that social media\n\n52:35.340 --> 52:37.600\n is not a major contributor,\n\n52:37.600 --> 52:40.060\n but most of the academic studies that I've seen\n\n52:40.060 --> 52:42.640\n actually show that social media use\n\n52:42.640 --> 52:45.400\n is correlated with lower polarization.\n\n52:45.400 --> 52:48.640\n And Genskow, the same person who just did the study\n\n52:48.640 --> 52:51.640\n that I cited about longitudinal polarization\n\n52:51.640 --> 52:53.060\n across different countries,\n\n52:54.180 --> 52:57.480\n also did a study that basically showed\n\n52:57.480 --> 53:02.120\n that if you looked after the 2016 election in the US,\n\n53:02.120 --> 53:04.280\n the voters who were the most polarized\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:07.560\n were actually the ones who were not on the internet.\n\n53:07.560 --> 53:10.280\n So, and there have been recent other studies,\n\n53:10.280 --> 53:12.840\n I think in Europe and around the world,\n\n53:12.840 --> 53:16.720\n basically showing that as people stop using social media,\n\n53:16.720 --> 53:19.200\n they tend to get more polarized.\n\n53:19.200 --> 53:21.360\n Then there's a deeper analysis around,\n\n53:21.360 --> 53:24.740\n okay, well, polarization actually isn't even one thing.\n\n53:24.740 --> 53:26.520\n Cause you know, having different opinions on something\n\n53:26.520 --> 53:28.900\n isn't, I don't think that that's by itself bad.\n\n53:28.900 --> 53:33.900\n What people who study this say is most problematic\n\n53:33.920 --> 53:35.920\n is what they call affective polarization,\n\n53:35.920 --> 53:37.920\n which is basically are you,\n\n53:37.920 --> 53:40.040\n do you have negative feelings towards people\n\n53:40.040 --> 53:41.040\n of another group?\n\n53:41.040 --> 53:43.760\n And the way that a lot of scholars study this\n\n53:43.760 --> 53:46.780\n is they basically ask a group,\n\n53:46.780 --> 53:50.600\n would you let your kids marry someone of group X?\n\n53:50.600 --> 53:53.320\n Whatever the groups are that you're worried\n\n53:53.320 --> 53:55.520\n that someone might have negative feelings towards.\n\n53:55.520 --> 53:58.160\n And in general, use of social media\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.880\n has corresponded to decreases\n\n53:59.880 --> 54:01.960\n in that kind of affective polarization.\n\n54:01.960 --> 54:04.760\n So I just wanna, I think we should talk\n\n54:04.760 --> 54:07.720\n through the design decisions and how we handle\n\n54:07.720 --> 54:10.720\n the kind of specific pieces of content,\n\n54:10.720 --> 54:13.280\n but overall, I think it's just worth grounding\n\n54:13.280 --> 54:15.600\n that discussion in the research that's existed\n\n54:15.600 --> 54:17.440\n that I think overwhelmingly shows\n\n54:17.440 --> 54:19.560\n that the mainstream narrative around this\n\n54:19.560 --> 54:21.040\n is just not right.\n\n54:21.040 --> 54:23.080\n But the narrative does take hold\n\n54:24.060 --> 54:27.920\n and it's compelling to a lot of people.\n\n54:27.920 --> 54:31.300\n There's another question I'd like to ask you on this.\n\n54:31.300 --> 54:33.800\n I was looking at various polls and saw that you're\n\n54:34.980 --> 54:38.080\n one of the most disliked tech leaders today,\n\n54:38.080 --> 54:41.400\n 54% unfavorable rating.\n\n54:41.400 --> 54:43.240\n Elon Musk is 23%.\n\n54:43.240 --> 54:46.260\n It's basically everybody has a very high unfavorable rating\n\n54:46.260 --> 54:48.000\n that are tech leaders.\n\n54:48.000 --> 54:50.640\n Maybe you can help me understand that.\n\n54:50.640 --> 54:53.300\n Why do you think so many people dislike you?\n\n54:54.720 --> 54:56.880\n Some even hate you.\n\n54:56.880 --> 54:59.160\n And how do you regain their trust and support?\n\n54:59.160 --> 55:00.900\n Given everything you just said,\n\n55:02.360 --> 55:05.360\n why are you losing the battle\n\n55:05.360 --> 55:09.440\n in explaining to people what actual impact\n\n55:09.440 --> 55:11.120\n social media has on society?\n\n55:12.440 --> 55:16.760\n Well, I'm curious if that's a US survey or world.\n\n55:16.760 --> 55:17.960\n It is US, yeah.\n\n55:17.960 --> 55:19.360\n So I think that there's a few dynamics.\n\n55:19.360 --> 55:23.360\n One is that our brand\n\n55:24.360 --> 55:27.880\n has been somewhat uniquely challenged in the US\n\n55:27.880 --> 55:29.040\n compared to other places.\n\n55:29.040 --> 55:29.880\n It's not that there are.\n\n55:29.880 --> 55:32.660\n I mean, other countries, we have issues too,\n\n55:32.660 --> 55:36.920\n but I think in the US, there was this dynamic where\n\n55:36.920 --> 55:38.880\n if you look at like the next sentiment\n\n55:38.880 --> 55:42.880\n of kind of coverage or attitude towards us,\n\n55:42.880 --> 55:44.880\n before 2016, I think that there were probably\n\n55:44.880 --> 55:47.480\n very few months, if any, where it was negative.\n\n55:47.480 --> 55:49.440\n And since 2016, I think that there probably\n\n55:49.440 --> 55:51.960\n been very few months, if any, then it's been positive.\n\n55:51.960 --> 55:53.600\n Politics.\n\n55:53.600 --> 55:55.360\n But I think it's a specific thing.\n\n55:55.360 --> 55:56.960\n And this is very different from other places.\n\n55:56.960 --> 55:59.840\n So I think in a lot of other countries in the world,\n\n55:59.840 --> 56:02.440\n the sentiment towards meta and our services\n\n56:02.440 --> 56:04.840\n is extremely positive.\n\n56:04.840 --> 56:06.600\n In the US, we have more challenges.\n\n56:06.600 --> 56:08.800\n And I think compared to other companies,\n\n56:09.800 --> 56:12.520\n you can look at certain industries,\n\n56:12.520 --> 56:16.320\n I think if you look at it from like a partisan perspective,\n\n56:16.320 --> 56:18.060\n not from like a political perspective,\n\n56:18.060 --> 56:19.080\n but just kind of culturally,\n\n56:19.080 --> 56:20.240\n it's like there are people who are probably\n\n56:20.240 --> 56:21.360\n more left of center and there are people\n\n56:21.360 --> 56:22.520\n who are more right of center,\n\n56:22.520 --> 56:25.880\n and there's kind of blue America and red America.\n\n56:25.880 --> 56:27.660\n There are certain industries that I think\n\n56:27.660 --> 56:30.880\n maybe one half of the country has a more positive view\n\n56:30.880 --> 56:32.200\n towards than another.\n\n56:32.200 --> 56:33.680\n And I think we're in a,\n\n56:36.400 --> 56:38.320\n one of the positions that we're in that I think\n\n56:38.320 --> 56:41.720\n is really challenging is that because of a lot\n\n56:41.720 --> 56:44.760\n of the content decisions that we've basically\n\n56:44.760 --> 56:49.560\n had to arbitrate, and because we're not a partisan company,\n\n56:49.560 --> 56:52.640\n we're not a Democrat company or a Republican company,\n\n56:52.640 --> 56:55.080\n we're trying to make the best decisions we can\n\n56:55.080 --> 56:58.480\n to help people connect and help people have as much voice\n\n56:58.480 --> 57:01.120\n as they can while having some rules\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:02.920\n because we're running a community.\n\n57:04.920 --> 57:07.420\n The net effect of that is that we're kind of constantly\n\n57:07.420 --> 57:11.760\n making decisions that piss off people in both camps.\n\n57:12.760 --> 57:17.160\n And the effect that I've sort of seen is that\n\n57:17.160 --> 57:20.260\n when we make a decision that is,\n\n57:21.480 --> 57:24.440\n that's a controversial one that's gonna upset,\n\n57:24.440 --> 57:26.500\n say about half the country,\n\n57:27.880 --> 57:30.340\n those decisions are all negative sum,\n\n57:30.340 --> 57:33.640\n from a brand perspective, because it's not like,\n\n57:33.640 --> 57:35.640\n if we make that decision in one way\n\n57:35.640 --> 57:37.840\n and say half the country is happy\n\n57:37.840 --> 57:40.000\n about that particular decision that we make,\n\n57:40.000 --> 57:43.720\n they tend to not say, oh, sweet, meta got that one right.\n\n57:43.720 --> 57:46.160\n They're just like, ah, you didn't mess that one up.\n\n57:46.160 --> 57:48.960\n But their opinion doesn't tend to go up by that much.\n\n57:48.960 --> 57:51.760\n Whereas the people who kind of are on the other side of it\n\n57:52.840 --> 57:55.080\n are like, God, how could you mess that up?\n\n57:55.080 --> 57:57.760\n How could you possibly think that that piece of content\n\n57:57.760 --> 58:00.120\n is okay and should be up and should not be censored?\n\n58:00.120 --> 58:04.940\n Or, and so I think the, whereas if you leave it up\n\n58:04.940 --> 58:09.220\n and, you know, it's, or if you take it down,\n\n58:09.220 --> 58:11.360\n the people who thought it should be taken down or,\n\n58:11.360 --> 58:12.740\n you know, it's like, all right, fine, great.\n\n58:12.740 --> 58:14.080\n You didn't mess that one up.\n\n58:14.080 --> 58:16.120\n So our internal assessment of,\n\n58:16.120 --> 58:17.920\n and the kind of analytics on our brand\n\n58:17.920 --> 58:20.540\n are basically anytime one of these big controversial things\n\n58:20.540 --> 58:22.000\n comes up in society,\n\n58:23.740 --> 58:26.080\n our brand goes down with half of the country.\n\n58:26.080 --> 58:27.600\n And then like, if you,\n\n58:27.600 --> 58:29.600\n and then if you just kind of extrapolate that out,\n\n58:29.600 --> 58:33.200\n it's just been very challenging for us to try to navigate\n\n58:33.200 --> 58:36.640\n what is a polarizing country in a principled way,\n\n58:36.640 --> 58:38.600\n where we're not trying to kind of hew to one side\n\n58:38.600 --> 58:39.440\n or the other, we're trying to do\n\n58:39.440 --> 58:41.040\n what we think is the right thing.\n\n58:41.040 --> 58:43.220\n But that's what I think is the right thing\n\n58:43.220 --> 58:44.060\n for us to do though.\n\n58:44.060 --> 58:47.360\n So, I mean, that's what we'll try to keep doing.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:50.160\n Just as a human being, how does it feel though,\n\n58:50.160 --> 58:53.380\n when you're giving so much of your day to day life\n\n58:53.380 --> 58:58.060\n to try to heal division, to try to do good in the world,\n\n58:58.060 --> 59:02.260\n as we've talked about, that so many people in the US,\n\n59:02.260 --> 59:06.480\n the place you call home have a negative view\n\n59:06.480 --> 59:09.120\n of you as a leader, as a human being\n\n59:09.120 --> 59:11.400\n and the company you love?\n\n59:14.040 --> 59:15.880\n Well, I mean, it's not great,\n\n59:15.880 --> 59:20.880\n but I mean, look, if I wanted people to think positively\n\n59:21.040 --> 59:22.800\n about me as a person,\n\n59:25.760 --> 59:27.960\n I don't know, I'm not sure if you go build a company.\n\n59:27.960 --> 59:28.800\n I mean, it's like.\n\n59:28.800 --> 59:30.280\n Or a social media company.\n\n59:30.280 --> 59:32.040\n It seems exceptionally difficult to do\n\n59:32.040 --> 59:32.880\n with a social media company.\n\n59:32.880 --> 59:34.800\n Yeah, so, I mean, I don't know,\n\n59:34.800 --> 59:39.760\n there is a dynamic where a lot of the other people\n\n59:39.760 --> 59:42.160\n running these companies, internet companies,\n\n59:42.160 --> 59:45.320\n have sort of stepped back and they just do things\n\n59:45.320 --> 59:49.480\n that are sort of, I don't know, less controversial.\n\n59:49.480 --> 59:52.720\n And some of it may be that they just get tired over time.\n\n59:52.720 --> 59:55.400\n But, you know, it's, so I don't know.\n\n59:55.400 --> 59:58.120\n I think that, you know, running a company is hard,\n\n59:58.120 --> 59:59.880\n building something at scale is hard.\n\n59:59.880 --> 1:00:01.640\n You only really do it for a long period of time\n\n1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:04.240\n if you really care about what you're doing.\n\n1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:08.000\n And yeah, so, I mean, it's not great, but like,\n\n1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.400\n but look, I think that at some level,\n\n1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:14.960\n whether 25% of people dislike you\n\n1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:18.080\n or 75% of people dislike you,\n\n1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:21.040\n your experience as a public figure is gonna be\n\n1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:23.360\n that there's a lot of people who dislike you, right?\n\n1:00:23.360 --> 1:00:28.360\n So, I actually am not sure how different it is.\n\n1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:31.200\n You know, certainly, you know,\n\n1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:32.760\n the country's gotten more polarized\n\n1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:35.040\n and we in particular have gotten, you know,\n\n1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:39.080\n more controversial over the last five or years or so.\n\n1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:44.080\n But, I don't know, I kind of think like as a public figure\n\n1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:48.560\n and leader of one of these enterprises.\n\n1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:49.400\n Comes with the job.\n\n1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:51.440\n Yeah, part of what you do is like,\n\n1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.640\n and look, the answer can't just be ignore it, right?\n\n1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:56.680\n Because like a huge part of the job\n\n1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:58.200\n is like you need to be getting feedback\n\n1:00:58.200 --> 1:01:00.760\n and internalizing feedback on how you can do better.\n\n1:01:00.760 --> 1:01:02.520\n But I think increasingly what you need to do\n\n1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.560\n is be able to figure out, you know,\n\n1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:08.000\n who are the kind of good faith critics\n\n1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.640\n who are criticizing you because\n\n1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:12.520\n they're trying to help you do a better job\n\n1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:13.960\n rather than tear you down.\n\n1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:16.440\n And those are the people I just think you have to cherish\n\n1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:19.120\n and like, and listen very closely\n\n1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:20.280\n to the things that they're saying,\n\n1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:23.040\n because, you know, I think it's just as dangerous\n\n1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:25.920\n to tune out everyone who says anything negative\n\n1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:29.320\n and just listen to the people who are kind of positive\n\n1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:31.240\n and support you, you know,\n\n1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:33.760\n as it would be psychologically to pay attention\n\n1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:36.600\n trying to make people who are never gonna like you like you.\n\n1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:38.880\n So I think that that's just kind of a dance\n\n1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.080\n that people have to do.\n\n1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:41.760\n But I mean, I, you know,\n\n1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:44.720\n so you kind of develop more of a feel for like,\n\n1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:46.280\n who actually is trying to accomplish\n\n1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:48.400\n the same types of things in the world\n\n1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:51.440\n and who has different ideas about how to do that\n\n1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:52.880\n and how can I learn from those people?\n\n1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:54.800\n And like, yeah, we get stuff wrong.\n\n1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:57.760\n And when the people whose opinions I respect\n\n1:01:57.760 --> 1:01:59.840\n call me out on getting stuff wrong,\n\n1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:02.120\n that hurts and makes me wanna do better.\n\n1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:04.680\n But I think at this point, I'm pretty tuned to just,\n\n1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:06.360\n all right, if someone, if I know they're,\n\n1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:08.080\n they're kind of like operating in bad faith\n\n1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:10.800\n and they're not really trying to help,\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.000\n then, you know, I don't know, it's not, it's, it doesn't,\n\n1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:13.840\n you know, I think over time,\n\n1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:15.280\n it just doesn't bother you that much.\n\n1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.720\n But you are surrounded by people that believe in the mission\n\n1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:19.680\n that love you.\n\n1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:23.600\n Are there friends or colleagues in your inner circle\n\n1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:26.560\n you trust that call you out on your bullshit\n\n1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:28.600\n whenever your thinking may be misguided\n\n1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:30.920\n as it is for leaders at times?\n\n1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:33.480\n I think we have a famously open company culture\n\n1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:39.440\n where we sort of encourage that kind of dissent internally,\n\n1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:41.760\n which is, you know, why there's so much material\n\n1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:43.120\n internally that can leak out\n\n1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:44.520\n with people sort of disagreeing\n\n1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:46.560\n is because that's sort of the culture.\n\n1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:50.200\n You know, our management team, I think it's a lot of people,\n\n1:02:50.200 --> 1:02:52.000\n you know, there are some newer folks who come in,\n\n1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.800\n there are some folks who've kind of been there for a while,\n\n1:02:54.800 --> 1:02:56.840\n but there's a very high level of trust.\n\n1:02:56.840 --> 1:02:59.840\n And I would say it is a relatively confrontational\n\n1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:01.080\n group of people.\n\n1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:04.560\n And my friends and family, I think, will push me on this.\n\n1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:06.400\n But look, it's not just,\n\n1:03:06.400 --> 1:03:09.280\n but I think you need some diversity, right?\n\n1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:12.080\n It can't just be, you know,\n\n1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:13.760\n people who are your friends and family.\n\n1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:16.920\n It's also, you know, I mean, there are journalists\n\n1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:19.520\n or analysts or, you know,\n\n1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:23.240\n peer executives at other companies\n\n1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:27.600\n or, you know, other people who sort of are insightful\n\n1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:28.760\n about thinking about the world,\n\n1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.800\n you know, certain politicians\n\n1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:32.680\n or people kind of in that sphere\n\n1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:36.160\n who I just think have like very insightful perspectives\n\n1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:39.800\n who even if they would,\n\n1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:41.600\n they come at the world from a different perspective,\n\n1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:44.360\n which is sort of what makes the perspective so valuable.\n\n1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:46.200\n But, you know, I think fundamentally\n\n1:03:46.200 --> 1:03:47.560\n we're trying to get to the same place\n\n1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:50.680\n in terms of, you know, helping people connect more,\n\n1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:53.480\n helping the whole world function better,\n\n1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:55.600\n not just, you know, one place or another.\n\n1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:58.920\n And I don't know, I mean,\n\n1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:02.880\n those are the people whose opinions really matter to me.\n\n1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:04.240\n And I just, it's, you know,\n\n1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:05.640\n that's how I learn on a day to day basis.\n\n1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:07.880\n People are constantly sending me comments on stuff\n\n1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:10.160\n or links to things they found interesting.\n\n1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:13.400\n And I don't know, it's kind of constantly evolving\n\n1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:14.480\n this model of the world\n\n1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:16.840\n and kind of what we should be aspiring to be.\n\n1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:20.000\n You've talked about, you have a famously open culture\n\n1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:25.440\n which comes with the criticism\n\n1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.280\n and the painful experiences.\n\n1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:30.960\n So let me ask you another difficult question.\n\n1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:33.440\n Frances Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower,\n\n1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:35.800\n leaked the internal Instagram research\n\n1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:38.040\n into teenagers and wellbeing.\n\n1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:41.240\n Her claim is that Instagram is choosing profit\n\n1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:43.080\n over wellbeing of teenage girls.\n\n1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:46.720\n So Instagram is quote, toxic for them.\n\n1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:48.120\n Your response titled,\n\n1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:52.440\n what our research really says about teen wellbeing\n\n1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:55.520\n and Instagram says, no, Instagram research shows\n\n1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:58.800\n that 11 of 12 wellbeing issues,\n\n1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:02.720\n teenage girls who said they struggle\n\n1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.400\n with those difficult issues also said\n\n1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:07.600\n that Instagram made them better rather than worse.\n\n1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:11.000\n Again, can you steal man and defend the point\n\n1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:14.800\n and Frances Haugen's characterization of the study\n\n1:05:14.800 --> 1:05:17.080\n and then help me understand the positive\n\n1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:19.000\n and negative effects of Instagram\n\n1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.880\n and Facebook on young people?\n\n1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:25.840\n So there are certainly questions around teen mental health\n\n1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:26.680\n that are really important.\n\n1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:29.480\n It's hard to, as a parent, it's like hard to imagine\n\n1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:32.040\n any set of questions that are sort of more important.\n\n1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.080\n I mean, I guess maybe other aspects of physical health\n\n1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:37.240\n or wellbeing are probably come to that level,\n\n1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:40.600\n but like, these are really important questions, right?\n\n1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:43.760\n Which is why we dedicate teams to studying them.\n\n1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:48.880\n I don't think the internet or social media are unique\n\n1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.000\n in having these questions.\n\n1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:53.160\n I mean, I think people and there've been sort of magazines\n\n1:05:53.160 --> 1:05:56.320\n with promoting certain body types for women\n\n1:05:56.320 --> 1:05:58.520\n and kids for decades,\n\n1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:01.440\n but we really care about this stuff.\n\n1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:02.760\n So we wanted to study it.\n\n1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:05.000\n And of course, we didn't expect\n\n1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000\n that everything was gonna be positive all the time.\n\n1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.520\n So, I mean, the reason why you study this stuff\n\n1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:10.760\n is to try to improve and get better.\n\n1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:13.200\n So, I mean, look, the place where I disagree\n\n1:06:13.200 --> 1:06:15.320\n with the characterization first,\n\n1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:18.720\n I thought some of the reporting and coverage of it\n\n1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:20.840\n just took the whole thing out of proportion\n\n1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:22.640\n and that it focused on, as you said,\n\n1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:24.280\n I think there were like 20 metrics in there\n\n1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:27.600\n and on 18 or 19, the effect of using Instagram\n\n1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:30.920\n was neutral or positive on the teen's wellbeing.\n\n1:06:30.920 --> 1:06:34.560\n And there was one area where I think it showed\n\n1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:35.480\n that we needed to improve\n\n1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:37.720\n and we took some steps to try to do that\n\n1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:38.800\n after doing the research.\n\n1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:41.680\n But I think having the coverage just focus on that one\n\n1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:43.040\n without focusing on the,\n\n1:06:43.040 --> 1:06:45.080\n I mean, I think an accurate characterization\n\n1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.920\n would have been that kids using Instagram\n\n1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:52.200\n or not kids, teens is generally positive\n\n1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:53.760\n for their mental health.\n\n1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:55.560\n But of course, that was not the narrative that came out.\n\n1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:56.720\n So I think it's hard to,\n\n1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:59.200\n that's not a kind of logical thing to straw man,\n\n1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:01.440\n but I sort of disagree or steel man,\n\n1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:04.040\n but I sort of disagree with that overall characterization.\n\n1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:08.800\n I think anyone sort of looking at this objectively would,\n\n1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:14.960\n but then, I mean, there is this sort of intent critique\n\n1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:16.360\n that I think you were getting at before,\n\n1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:19.680\n which says, it assumes some sort of malevolence, right?\n\n1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:23.160\n It's like, which it's really hard for me\n\n1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:26.520\n to really wrap my head around this\n\n1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:29.800\n because as far as I know,\n\n1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:31.720\n it's not clear that any of the other tech companies\n\n1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:33.320\n are doing this kind of research.\n\n1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:37.840\n So why the narrative should form that we did research\n\n1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:38.800\n because we were studying an issue\n\n1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:40.760\n because we wanted to understand it to improve\n\n1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:43.560\n and took steps after that to try to improve it,\n\n1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:46.280\n that your interpretation of that would be\n\n1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:47.880\n that we did the research\n\n1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:49.240\n and tried to sweep it under the rug.\n\n1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:53.920\n It just, it sort of is like, I don't know,\n\n1:07:53.920 --> 1:07:55.920\n it's beyond credibility to me\n\n1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:59.000\n that like that's the accurate description of the actions\n\n1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.160\n that we've taken compared to the others in the industry.\n\n1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:05.280\n So I don't know, that's kind of, that's my view on it.\n\n1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:06.600\n These are really important issues\n\n1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:07.960\n and there's a lot of stuff\n\n1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:09.120\n that I think we're gonna be working on\n\n1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.400\n related to teen mental health for a long time,\n\n1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:14.240\n including trying to understand this better.\n\n1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:15.280\n And I would encourage everyone else\n\n1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:16.840\n in the industry to do this too.\n\n1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:21.880\n Yeah, I would love there to be open conversations\n\n1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:25.680\n and a lot of great research being released internally\n\n1:08:25.680 --> 1:08:27.960\n and then also externally.\n\n1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:31.040\n It doesn't make me feel good\n\n1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:35.000\n to see press obviously get way more clicks\n\n1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:39.280\n when they say negative things about social media.\n\n1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:41.520\n Objectively speaking, I can just tell\n\n1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:44.400\n that there's hunger to say negative things\n\n1:08:44.400 --> 1:08:46.040\n about social media.\n\n1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:50.720\n And I don't understand how that's supposed to lead\n\n1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:53.000\n to an open conversation about the positives\n\n1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.000\n and the negatives, the concerns about social media,\n\n1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.200\n especially when you're doing that kind of research.\n\n1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:01.720\n I mean, I don't know what to do with that,\n\n1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:03.920\n but let me ask you as a father,\n\n1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:06.720\n there's a weight heavy on you\n\n1:09:06.720 --> 1:09:10.280\n that people get bullied on social networks.\n\n1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.520\n So people get bullied in their private life.\n\n1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:17.080\n But now because so much of our life is in the digital world,\n\n1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:19.640\n the bullying moves from the physical world\n\n1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:21.200\n to the digital world.\n\n1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:23.280\n So you're now creating a platform\n\n1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:26.520\n on which bullying happens.\n\n1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:30.440\n And some of that bullying can lead to damage\n\n1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:31.840\n to mental health.\n\n1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:35.120\n And some of that bullying can lead to depression,\n\n1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:36.320\n even suicide.\n\n1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:38.760\n There's a weight heavy on you\n\n1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:43.240\n that people have committed suicide\n\n1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:46.120\n or will commit suicide based on the bullying\n\n1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:48.080\n that happens on social media.\n\n1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:51.560\n Yeah, I mean, there's a set of harms\n\n1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:55.400\n that we basically track and build systems to fight against.\n\n1:09:55.400 --> 1:10:00.400\n And bullying and self harm are,\n\n1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:03.240\n these are some of the biggest things\n\n1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:06.000\n that we are most focused on.\n\n1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:14.400\n For bullying, like you say, it's gonna be,\n\n1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.240\n while this predates the internet,\n\n1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:20.880\n then it's probably impossible to get rid of all of it.\n\n1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.160\n You wanna give people tools to fight it\n\n1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:27.200\n and you wanna fight it yourself.\n\n1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:28.800\n And you also wanna make sure that people have the tools\n\n1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:30.160\n to get help when they need it.\n\n1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:33.200\n So I think this isn't like a question of,\n\n1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:34.640\n can you get rid of all bullying?\n\n1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:39.080\n I mean, it's like, all right, I mean, I have two daughters\n\n1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:43.840\n and they fight and push each other around and stuff too.\n\n1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:44.680\n And the question is just,\n\n1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.080\n how do you handle that situation?\n\n1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:51.480\n And there's a handful of things that I think you can do.\n\n1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:55.000\n We talked a little bit before around some of the AI tools\n\n1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.800\n that you can build to identify\n\n1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.160\n when something harmful is happening.\n\n1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:00.480\n It's actually, it's very hard in bullying\n\n1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:02.720\n because a lot of bullying is very context specific.\n\n1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:06.320\n It's not like you're trying to fit a formula of like,\n\n1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:09.480\n if like looking at the different harms,\n\n1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.280\n someone promoting a terrorist group is like,\n\n1:11:12.280 --> 1:11:14.360\n probably one of the simpler things to generally find\n\n1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:17.000\n because things promoting that group are gonna look\n\n1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.240\n at a certain way or feel a certain way.\n\n1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.840\n Bullying could just be, you know,\n\n1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:24.880\n someone making some subtle comment about someone's appearance\n\n1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.800\n that's idiosyncratic to them.\n\n1:11:26.800 --> 1:11:28.680\n And it could look at just like humor.\n\n1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:31.000\n So humor to one person can be destructive\n\n1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:32.280\n to another human being, yeah.\n\n1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.400\n So with bullying, I think there are certain things\n\n1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:39.280\n that you can find through AI systems,\n\n1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.640\n but I think it is increasingly important\n\n1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:44.800\n to just give people more agency themselves.\n\n1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:46.480\n So we've done things like making it\n\n1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:47.800\n so people can turn off comments\n\n1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:52.240\n or take a break from hearing from a specific person\n\n1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:54.120\n without having to signal at all\n\n1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:55.600\n that they're gonna stop following them\n\n1:11:55.600 --> 1:11:58.200\n or kind of make some stand that,\n\n1:11:58.200 --> 1:11:59.400\n okay, I'm not friends with you anymore.\n\n1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:00.440\n I'm not following you.\n\n1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:01.880\n I just like, I just don't wanna hear about this,\n\n1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:05.560\n but I also don't wanna signal at all publicly\n\n1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:08.880\n that or to them that there's been an issue.\n\n1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:14.040\n And then you get to some of the more extreme cases\n\n1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:14.880\n like you're talking about\n\n1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:19.160\n where someone is thinking about self harm or suicide.\n\n1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:24.080\n And there we've found that that is a place\n\n1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:26.400\n where AI can identify a lot\n\n1:12:26.400 --> 1:12:28.560\n as well as people flagging things.\n\n1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:31.080\n If people are expressing something\n\n1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:35.000\n that is potentially they're thinking of hurting themselves,\n\n1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.520\n those are cues that you can build systems\n\n1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.560\n and hundreds of languages around the world\n\n1:12:39.560 --> 1:12:41.080\n to be able to identify that.\n\n1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:45.320\n And one of the things that I'm actually quite proud of\n\n1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:47.400\n is we've built these systems\n\n1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:50.960\n that I think are clearly leading at this point\n\n1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:53.000\n that not only identify that,\n\n1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.040\n but then connect with local first responders\n\n1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:59.680\n and have been able to save, I think at this point,\n\n1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.960\n it's in thousands of cases,\n\n1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:04.560\n be able to get first responders to people\n\n1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.960\n through these systems who really need them\n\n1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:09.600\n because of specific plumbing that we've done\n\n1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:11.680\n between the AI work and being able to communicate\n\n1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:13.800\n with local first responder organizations.\n\n1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:15.800\n We're rolling that out in more places around the world.\n\n1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.160\n And I think the team that worked on that\n\n1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:19.360\n just did awesome stuff.\n\n1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:22.760\n So I think that that's a long way of saying,\n\n1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:25.480\n yeah, I mean, this is a heavy topic\n\n1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:28.440\n and you want to attack it in a bunch of different ways\n\n1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.240\n and also kind of understand that some of nature\n\n1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:36.360\n is for people to do this to each other,\n\n1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:37.320\n which is unfortunate,\n\n1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:40.600\n but you can give people tools and build things that help.\n\n1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:43.840\n It's still one hell of a burden though.\n\n1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:46.160\n A platform that allows people\n\n1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:47.760\n to fall in love with each other\n\n1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:51.000\n is also by nature going to be a platform\n\n1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.880\n that allows people to hurt each other.\n\n1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:57.120\n And when you're managing such a platform, it's difficult.\n\n1:13:57.120 --> 1:13:58.200\n And I think you spoke to it,\n\n1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:01.280\n but the psychology of that, of being a leader in that space,\n\n1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:05.280\n of creating technology that's playing in this space,\n\n1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:08.760\n like you mentioned, psychology is really damn difficult.\n\n1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:13.120\n And I mean, the burden of that is just great.\n\n1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:17.240\n I just wanted to hear you speak to that point.\n\n1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:23.160\n I have to ask about the thing you've brought up a few times,\n\n1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:25.320\n which is making controversial decisions.\n\n1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:29.440\n Let's talk about free speech and censorship.\n\n1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:33.920\n So there are two groups of people pressuring Meta on this.\n\n1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:37.240\n One group is upset that Facebook, the social network,\n\n1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:41.480\n allows misinformation in quotes to be spread on the platform.\n\n1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:44.800\n The other group are concerned that Facebook censors speech\n\n1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:46.560\n by calling it misinformation.\n\n1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:48.840\n So you're getting it from both sides.\n\n1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:53.840\n You, in 2019, October at Georgetown University,\n\n1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:58.240\n eloquently defended the importance of free speech,\n\n1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:04.240\n but then COVID came and the 2020 election came.\n\n1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:06.440\n Do you worry that outside pressures\n\n1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.840\n from advertisers, politicians, the public,\n\n1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:11.840\n have forced Meta to damage the ideal of free speech\n\n1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:13.120\n that you spoke highly of?\n\n1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.880\n Just to say some obvious things upfront,\n\n1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:18.840\n I don't think pressure from advertisers\n\n1:15:18.840 --> 1:15:21.440\n or politicians directly in any way\n\n1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:22.680\n affects how we think about this.\n\n1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:25.080\n I think these are just hard topics.\n\n1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:26.880\n So let me just take you through our evolution\n\n1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:28.240\n from kind of the beginning of the company\n\n1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:29.360\n to where we are now.\n\n1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:31.720\n You don't build a company like this\n\n1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:34.120\n unless you believe that people expressing themselves\n\n1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.720\n is a good thing, right?\n\n1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:38.160\n So that's sort of the foundational thing.\n\n1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:41.880\n You can kind of think about our company as a formula\n\n1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:44.240\n where we think giving people voice\n\n1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:47.440\n and helping people connect creates opportunity, right?\n\n1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:49.640\n So those are the two things that we're always focused on\n\n1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:50.800\n are sort of helping people connect.\n\n1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:52.080\n We talked about that a lot,\n\n1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:53.880\n but also giving people voice\n\n1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.800\n and ability to express themselves.\n\n1:15:55.800 --> 1:15:56.960\n Then by the way, most of the time\n\n1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:58.120\n when people express themselves,\n\n1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:00.840\n that's not like politically controversial content.\n\n1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:04.040\n It's like expressing something about their identity\n\n1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:06.520\n that's more related to the avatar conversation\n\n1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:08.600\n we had earlier in terms of expressing some facet,\n\n1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:11.240\n but that's what's important to people on a day to day basis.\n\n1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:13.480\n And sometimes when people feel strongly enough\n\n1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:16.360\n about something, it kind of becomes a political topic.\n\n1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:19.120\n That's sort of always been a thing that we've focused on.\n\n1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:22.320\n There's always been the question of safety in this,\n\n1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:24.360\n which if you're building a community,\n\n1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:26.040\n I think you have to focus on safety.\n\n1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.320\n We've had these community standards from early on,\n\n1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:32.640\n and there are about 20 different kinds of harm\n\n1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.840\n that we track and try to fight actively.\n\n1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:36.400\n We've talked about some of them already.\n\n1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:40.880\n So it includes things like bullying and harassment.\n\n1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:45.880\n It includes things like terrorism or promoting terrorism,\n\n1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.320\n inciting violence, intellectual property theft.\n\n1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:53.760\n And in general, I think call it about 18 out of 20 of those.\n\n1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:57.200\n There's not really a particularly polarized definition\n\n1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:58.040\n of that.\n\n1:16:59.160 --> 1:17:01.440\n I think you're not really gonna find many people\n\n1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:03.760\n in the country or in the world\n\n1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.800\n who are trying to say we should be\n\n1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:09.320\n fighting terrorist content less.\n\n1:17:09.320 --> 1:17:12.200\n I think the content where there are a couple of areas\n\n1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:14.000\n where I think that this has gotten more controversial\n\n1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.320\n recently, which I'll talk about.\n\n1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:20.000\n And you're right, the misinformation is basically is up there.\n\n1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.920\n And I think sometimes the definition of hate speech\n\n1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:22.760\n is up there too.\n\n1:17:22.760 --> 1:17:25.760\n But I think in general, most of the content\n\n1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:28.600\n that I think we're working on for safety\n\n1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:32.560\n is not actually, people don't kind of have these questions.\n\n1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:35.280\n So it's sort of this subset.\n\n1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:37.400\n But if you go back to the beginning of the company,\n\n1:17:37.400 --> 1:17:42.000\n this was sort of pre deep learning days.\n\n1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.000\n And therefore, it was me and my roommate Dustin join me.\n\n1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:52.000\n And if someone posted something bad,\n\n1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:57.880\n it was the AI technology did not exist yet\n\n1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:01.240\n to be able to go basically look at all the content.\n\n1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:06.120\n And we were a small enough outfit\n\n1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:08.800\n that no one would expect that we could review it all.\n\n1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:10.400\n Even if someone reported it to us,\n\n1:18:10.400 --> 1:18:11.720\n we basically did our best, right?\n\n1:18:11.720 --> 1:18:12.680\n It's like someone would report it\n\n1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:16.880\n and we try to look at stuff and deal with stuff.\n\n1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:21.880\n And for call it the first seven or eight years\n\n1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:26.600\n of the company, we weren't that big of a company.\n\n1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:28.760\n For a lot of that period, we weren't even really profitable.\n\n1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.520\n The AI didn't really exist to be able to do\n\n1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.720\n the kind of moderation that we do today.\n\n1:18:32.720 --> 1:18:35.760\n And then at some point in kind of the middle\n\n1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:38.160\n of the last decade, that started to flip.\n\n1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:43.160\n And we got to the point where we were sort of a larger\n\n1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:45.240\n and more profitable company.\n\n1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:48.000\n And the AI was starting to come online\n\n1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.480\n to be able to proactively detect\n\n1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:52.840\n some of the simpler forms of this.\n\n1:18:52.840 --> 1:18:54.800\n So things like pornography,\n\n1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.600\n you could train an image classifier\n\n1:18:57.600 --> 1:18:59.520\n to identify what a nipple was,\n\n1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:01.320\n or you can fight against terrorist content.\n\n1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:02.160\n You still could.\n\n1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:03.440\n There's actually papers on this, it's great.\n\n1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:04.280\n Oh, of course there are.\n\n1:19:04.280 --> 1:19:05.120\n Technical papers.\n\n1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:06.480\n Of course there are.\n\n1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:09.280\n Those are relatively easier things to train AI to do\n\n1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:12.440\n than for example, understand the nuances\n\n1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:14.000\n of what is inciting violence\n\n1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.800\n in a hundred languages around the world\n\n1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:20.200\n and not have the false positives of like,\n\n1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:22.360\n okay, are you posting about this thing\n\n1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:24.040\n that might be inciting violence\n\n1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:26.360\n because you're actually trying to denounce it?\n\n1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:28.280\n In which case we probably shouldn't take that down.\n\n1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:29.520\n Where if you're trying to denounce something\n\n1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:33.920\n that's inciting violence in some kind of dialect\n\n1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:37.200\n in a corner of India, as opposed to,\n\n1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:38.440\n okay, actually you're posting this thing\n\n1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:39.600\n because you're trying to incite violence.\n\n1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:42.360\n Okay, building an AI that can basically get\n\n1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.400\n to that level of nuance and all the languages\n\n1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:47.120\n that we serve is something that I think\n\n1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:49.680\n is only really becoming possible now,\n\n1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.920\n not towards the middle of the last decade.\n\n1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:54.880\n But there's been this evolution,\n\n1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:56.080\n and I think what happened,\n\n1:19:57.560 --> 1:20:00.120\n people sort of woke up after 2016\n\n1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:02.560\n and a lot of people are like,\n\n1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:05.000\n okay, the country is a lot more polarized\n\n1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:08.080\n and there's a lot more stuff here than we realized.\n\n1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:11.800\n Why weren't these internet companies on top of this?\n\n1:20:11.800 --> 1:20:16.800\n And I think at that point it was reasonable feedback\n\n1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:22.400\n that some of this technology had started becoming possible.\n\n1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:25.320\n And at that point, I really did feel like\n\n1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:27.920\n we needed to make a substantially larger investment.\n\n1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:29.680\n We'd already worked on this stuff a lot,\n\n1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:32.400\n on AI and on these integrity problems,\n\n1:20:32.400 --> 1:20:35.360\n but that we should basically invest,\n\n1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:37.080\n have a thousand or more engineers\n\n1:20:37.080 --> 1:20:39.160\n basically work on building these AI systems\n\n1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:41.600\n to be able to go and proactively identify the stuff\n\n1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:43.680\n across all these different areas.\n\n1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:45.360\n Okay, so we went and did that.\n\n1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:48.000\n Now we've built the tools to be able to do that.\n\n1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.560\n And now I think it's actually a much more complicated\n\n1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:53.400\n set of philosophical rather than technical questions,\n\n1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:56.960\n which is the exact policies, which are okay.\n\n1:20:56.960 --> 1:21:01.960\n Now, the way that we basically hold ourselves accountable\n\n1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:04.400\n is we issue these transparency reports every quarter\n\n1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:06.320\n and the metric that we track is for each of these\n\n1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:10.240\n 20 types of harmful content.\n\n1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.400\n How much of that content are we taking down\n\n1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:14.320\n before someone even has to report it to us?\n\n1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:17.000\n So how effective is our AI at doing this?\n\n1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.440\n But that basically creates this big question,\n\n1:21:19.440 --> 1:21:22.960\n which is okay, now we need to really be careful\n\n1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:25.440\n about how proactive we set the AI\n\n1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:28.000\n and where the exact policy lines are\n\n1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.200\n around what we're taking down.\n\n1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:35.200\n It's certainly at a point now where I felt like\n\n1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:37.720\n at the beginning of that journey\n\n1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:42.720\n of building those AI systems, there was a lot of push.\n\n1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:44.360\n There's saying, okay, you've got to do more.\n\n1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:46.320\n There's clearly a lot more bad content\n\n1:21:46.320 --> 1:21:49.880\n that people aren't reporting or that you're not getting to\n\n1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.200\n and you need to get more effective at that.\n\n1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:52.920\n And I was pretty sympathetic to that.\n\n1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:54.800\n But then I think at some point along the way,\n\n1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:58.960\n there started to be almost equal issues on both sides\n\n1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:00.960\n of, okay, actually you're kind of taking down\n\n1:22:00.960 --> 1:22:02.080\n too much stuff, right?\n\n1:22:02.080 --> 1:22:05.560\n Or some of the stuff is borderline\n\n1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:07.560\n and it wasn't really bothering anyone\n\n1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:09.640\n and they didn't report it.\n\n1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:13.000\n So is that really an issue that you need to take down?\n\n1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.440\n Whereas we still have the critique on the other side too\n\n1:22:15.440 --> 1:22:18.560\n where a lot of people think we're not doing enough.\n\n1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:21.840\n So it's become, as we built the technical capacity,\n\n1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:25.960\n I think it becomes more philosophically interesting almost\n\n1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:27.520\n where you wanna be on the line.\n\n1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:31.160\n And I just think you don't want one person\n\n1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:32.440\n making those decisions.\n\n1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:33.760\n So we've also tried to innovate\n\n1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:36.520\n in terms of building out this independent oversight board,\n\n1:22:36.520 --> 1:22:39.520\n which has people who are dedicated to free expression\n\n1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:43.640\n but from around the world who people can appeal cases to.\n\n1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.200\n So a lot of the most controversial cases basically go to them\n\n1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:47.640\n and they make the final binding decision\n\n1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:49.080\n on how we should handle that.\n\n1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:50.680\n And then of course, their decisions,\n\n1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:53.000\n we then try to figure out what the principles are\n\n1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.760\n behind those and encode them into the algorithms.\n\n1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:58.080\n And how are those people chosen, which, you know,\n\n1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.200\n you're outsourcing a difficult decision.\n\n1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:02.560\n Yeah, the initial people,\n\n1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:07.560\n we chose a handful of chairs for the group\n\n1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:12.480\n and we basically chose the people\n\n1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:15.600\n for a commitment to free expression\n\n1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:19.640\n and like a broad understanding of human rights\n\n1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:21.520\n and the trade offs around free expression.\n\n1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:22.720\n So they fundamentally people\n\n1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.880\n who are gonna lean towards free expression.\n\n1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.040\n Towards freedom of speech.\n\n1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:28.560\n Okay, so there's also this idea of fact checkers.\n\n1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:31.600\n So jumping around to the misinformation questions,\n\n1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:33.120\n especially during COVID,\n\n1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:36.080\n which is an exceptionally speaking of polarization.\n\n1:23:36.080 --> 1:23:38.240\n Can I speak to the COVID thing?\n\n1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.240\n I mean, I think one of the hardest set of questions\n\n1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:41.200\n around free expression,\n\n1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:42.240\n because you asked about Georgetown\n\n1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:43.840\n has my stance fundamentally changed?\n\n1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:48.400\n And the answer to that is no, my stance has not changed.\n\n1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:52.040\n It is fundamentally the same as when I was talking\n\n1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:56.480\n at Georgetown from a philosophical perspective.\n\n1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:01.480\n The challenge with free speech is that everyone agrees\n\n1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:05.440\n that there is a line where if you're actually\n\n1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:08.160\n about to do physical harm to people\n\n1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:10.560\n that there should be restrictions.\n\n1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.960\n So, I mean, there's the famous Supreme Court\n\n1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:15.120\n historical example of like,\n\n1:24:15.120 --> 1:24:17.200\n you can't yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\n1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:20.360\n The thing that everyone disagrees on\n\n1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:22.680\n is what is the definition of real harm?\n\n1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:24.560\n Where I think some people think,\n\n1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:27.920\n okay, this should only be a very literal,\n\n1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:29.840\n I mean, take it back to the bullying conversation\n\n1:24:29.840 --> 1:24:32.760\n we were just having, where is it just harm\n\n1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.800\n if the person is about to hurt themselves\n\n1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:36.640\n because they've been bullied so hard?\n\n1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:39.880\n Or is it actually harm like as they're being bullied?\n\n1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:42.160\n And kind of at what point in the spectrum is that?\n\n1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:44.480\n And that's the part that there's not agreement on.\n\n1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:47.000\n But I think what people agree on pretty broadly\n\n1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.440\n is that when there is an acute threat\n\n1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:52.960\n that it does make sense from a societal perspective\n\n1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:57.120\n to tolerate less speech.\n\n1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:59.560\n That could be potentially harmful in that acute situation.\n\n1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:02.840\n So I think where COVID got very difficult is,\n\n1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:06.000\n I don't think anyone expected this to be going on for years.\n\n1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.360\n But if you'd kind of asked now a priori,\n\n1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.880\n would a global pandemic where a lot of people are dying\n\n1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:19.040\n and catching this, is that an emergency\n\n1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:21.560\n that where you'd kind of consider it\n\n1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:25.600\n that it's problematic to basically yell fire\n\n1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:26.840\n in a crowded theater?\n\n1:25:26.840 --> 1:25:29.000\n I think that that probably passes that test.\n\n1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:32.320\n So I think that it's a very tricky situation,\n\n1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:35.240\n but I think the fundamental commitment\n\n1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:38.200\n to free expression is there.\n\n1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:39.840\n And that's what I believe.\n\n1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:41.440\n And again, I don't think you start this company\n\n1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:42.720\n unless you care about people being able\n\n1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:44.800\n to express themselves as much as possible.\n\n1:25:44.800 --> 1:25:48.880\n But I think that that's the question,\n\n1:25:48.880 --> 1:25:50.480\n is how do you define what the harm is\n\n1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:52.440\n and how acute that is?\n\n1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.440\n And what are the institutions that define that harm?\n\n1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:59.720\n A lot of the criticism is that the CDC, the WHO,\n\n1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:03.800\n the institutions we've come to trust as a civilization\n\n1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:07.760\n to give the line of what is and isn't harm\n\n1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:11.640\n in terms of health policy have failed in many ways,\n\n1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:14.320\n in small ways and in big ways, depending on who you ask.\n\n1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:17.120\n And then the perspective of meta and Facebook is like,\n\n1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:20.160\n well, where the hell do I get the information\n\n1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:22.400\n of what is and isn't misinformation?\n\n1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:25.160\n So it's a really difficult place to be in,\n\n1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:26.720\n but it's great to hear that you're leaning\n\n1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:30.140\n towards freedom of speech on this aspect.\n\n1:26:30.140 --> 1:26:33.000\n And again, I think this actually calls to the fact\n\n1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.320\n that we need to reform institutions\n\n1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:36.800\n that help keep an open mind\n\n1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:39.000\n of what is and isn't misinformation.\n\n1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:44.600\n And misinformation has been used to bully on the internet.\n\n1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:46.920\n I mean, I just have, I'm friends with Joe Rogan\n\n1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:49.280\n and he is called as a,\n\n1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:51.280\n I remember hanging out with him in Vegas\n\n1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:54.660\n and somebody yelled, stop spreading misinformation.\n\n1:26:54.660 --> 1:26:57.640\n I mean, and there's a lot of people that follow him\n\n1:26:57.640 --> 1:26:59.880\n that believe he's not spreading misinformation.\n\n1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:02.900\n Like you can't just not acknowledge the fact\n\n1:27:02.900 --> 1:27:05.720\n that there's a large number of people\n\n1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:08.840\n that have a different definition of misinformation.\n\n1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:10.760\n And that's such a tough place to be.\n\n1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:11.840\n Like who do you listen to?\n\n1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:15.320\n Do you listen to quote unquote experts who gets,\n\n1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:17.600\n as a person who has a PhD, I gotta say,\n\n1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:20.160\n I mean, I'm not sure I know what defines an expert,\n\n1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:22.720\n especially in a new,\n\n1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:29.080\n in a totally new pandemic or a new catastrophic event,\n\n1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:31.520\n especially when politics is involved\n\n1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:33.320\n and especially when the news are,\n\n1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:37.440\n the media involved that can propagate\n\n1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:39.520\n sort of outrageous narratives\n\n1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:40.720\n and thereby make a lot of money.\n\n1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:41.800\n Like what the hell?\n\n1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:43.200\n Where's the source of truth?\n\n1:27:43.200 --> 1:27:45.480\n And then everybody turns to Facebook.\n\n1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:48.040\n It's like, please tell me what the source of truth is.\n\n1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:50.740\n Well, I mean, well, how would you handle this\n\n1:27:50.740 --> 1:27:52.680\n if you were in my position?\n\n1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:55.160\n Is very, very, very, very difficult.\n\n1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:56.440\n I would say,\n\n1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:02.680\n I would more speak about how difficult the choices are\n\n1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:04.040\n and be transparent about like,\n\n1:28:04.040 --> 1:28:05.360\n what the hell do you do with this?\n\n1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:07.080\n Like here, you got exactly,\n\n1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:08.800\n ask the exact question you just asked me,\n\n1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:10.840\n but to the broader public, like, okay, yeah,\n\n1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:12.400\n you guys tell me what to do.\n\n1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:14.200\n So like crowdsource it.\n\n1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:19.200\n And then the other aspect is when you spoke really eloquently\n\n1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:23.440\n about the fact that there's this going back and forth\n\n1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:25.240\n and now there's a feeling like you're censoring\n\n1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:26.720\n a little bit too much.\n\n1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.240\n So I would lean, I would try to be ahead of that feeling.\n\n1:28:30.240 --> 1:28:33.080\n I would now lean towards freedom of speech and say,\n\n1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:36.240\n we're not the ones that are going to define misinformation.\n\n1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:40.040\n Let it be a public debate, let the idea stand.\n\n1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:44.280\n And I actually place, this idea of misinformation,\n\n1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:46.360\n I place the responsibility\n\n1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:50.020\n on the poor communication skills of scientists.\n\n1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:52.560\n They should be in the battlefield of ideas\n\n1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:57.400\n and everybody who is spreading information\n\n1:28:57.400 --> 1:29:00.400\n against the vaccine, they should not be censored.\n\n1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:03.040\n They should be talked with and you should show the data,\n\n1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:04.800\n you should have open discussion\n\n1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:07.080\n as opposed to rolling your eyes and saying,\n\n1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:09.840\n I'm the expert, I know what I'm talking about.\n\n1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:13.240\n No, you need to convince people, it's a battle of ideas.\n\n1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:15.360\n So that's the whole point of freedom of speech.\n\n1:29:15.360 --> 1:29:17.120\n It's the way to defeat bad ideas\n\n1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:20.080\n is with good ideas, with speech.\n\n1:29:20.080 --> 1:29:22.080\n So like the responsibility here falls\n\n1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:26.560\n on the poor communication skills of scientists.\n\n1:29:26.560 --> 1:29:31.560\n Thanks to social media, scientists are not communicators.\n\n1:29:32.180 --> 1:29:34.040\n They have the power to communicate.\n\n1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:36.800\n Some of the best stuff I've seen about COVID\n\n1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:38.840\n from doctors is on social media.\n\n1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:41.520\n It's a way to learn to respond really quickly,\n\n1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:43.800\n to go faster than the peer review process.\n\n1:29:43.800 --> 1:29:45.460\n And so they just need to get way better\n\n1:29:45.460 --> 1:29:46.480\n at that communication.\n\n1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:50.060\n And also by better, I don't mean just convincing,\n\n1:29:50.060 --> 1:29:51.800\n I also mean speak with humility,\n\n1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:54.280\n don't talk down to people, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:56.000\n And as a platform, I would say,\n\n1:29:56.860 --> 1:29:59.800\n I would step back a little bit.\n\n1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:00.800\n Not all the way, of course,\n\n1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:03.520\n because there's a lot of stuff that can cause real harm\n\n1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:04.440\n as we've talked about,\n\n1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:06.920\n but you lean more towards freedom of speech\n\n1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:09.560\n because then people from a brand perspective\n\n1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:12.740\n wouldn't be blaming you for the other ills of society,\n\n1:30:13.760 --> 1:30:14.600\n which there are many.\n\n1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:19.600\n The institutions have flaws, the political divide,\n\n1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:23.400\n obviously politicians have flaws, that's news.\n\n1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:28.040\n The media has flaws that they're all trying to work with.\n\n1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:31.080\n And because of the central place of Facebook in the world,\n\n1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:34.320\n all of those flaws somehow kind of propagate to Facebook.\n\n1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:38.160\n And you're sitting there as Plato, the philosopher,\n\n1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:40.720\n have to answer to some of the most difficult questions\n\n1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:43.960\n asking, being asked of human civilization.\n\n1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:47.000\n So I don't know, maybe this is an American answer though,\n\n1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:48.420\n to lean towards freedom of speech.\n\n1:30:48.420 --> 1:30:50.320\n I don't know if that applies globally.\n\n1:30:51.300 --> 1:30:52.640\n So yeah, I don't know.\n\n1:30:52.640 --> 1:30:57.400\n But transparency and saying, I think as a technologist,\n\n1:30:57.400 --> 1:30:59.560\n one of the things I sense about Facebook and meta\n\n1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:02.360\n when people talk about this company\n\n1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.960\n is they don't necessarily understand\n\n1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:06.880\n fully how difficult the problem is.\n\n1:31:06.880 --> 1:31:08.440\n You talked about AI has to catch\n\n1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:11.720\n a bunch of harmful stuff really quickly.\n\n1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:14.600\n Just the sea of data you have to deal with.\n\n1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:16.700\n It's a really difficult problem.\n\n1:31:16.700 --> 1:31:18.400\n So like any of the critics,\n\n1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:21.520\n if you just hand them the helm for a week,\n\n1:31:22.840 --> 1:31:24.360\n let's see how well you can do.\n\n1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:28.160\n Like that, to me, that's definitely something\n\n1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:31.320\n that would wake people up to how difficult this problem is\n\n1:31:31.320 --> 1:31:32.640\n if there's more transparency\n\n1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:35.580\n of saying how difficult this problem is.\n\n1:31:35.580 --> 1:31:37.800\n Let me ask you about, on the AI front,\n\n1:31:37.800 --> 1:31:41.600\n just because you mentioned language and my ineloquence.\n\n1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:44.120\n Translation is something I wanted to ask you about.\n\n1:31:44.120 --> 1:31:47.760\n And first, just to give a shout out to the supercomputer.\n\n1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:51.960\n You've recently announced the AI research supercluster, RSC.\n\n1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:54.680\n Obviously, I'm somebody who loves the GPUs.\n\n1:31:54.680 --> 1:31:57.120\n It currently has 6,000 GPUs.\n\n1:31:57.120 --> 1:32:02.120\n NVIDIA DGX A100 is the systems that have\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.080\n in total 6,000 GPUs.\n\n1:32:04.080 --> 1:32:06.560\n And it will eventually, maybe this year,\n\n1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:10.000\n maybe soon, will have 16,000 GPUs.\n\n1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:11.680\n So it can do a bunch of different kinds\n\n1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:15.040\n of machine learning applications.\n\n1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:18.560\n There's a cool thing on the distributed storage aspect\n\n1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:19.680\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:23.040\n So one of the applications that I think is super exciting\n\n1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.320\n is translation, real time translation.\n\n1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:29.120\n I mentioned to you that having a conversation,\n\n1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:30.200\n I speak Russian fluently,\n\n1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:32.360\n I speak English somewhat fluently,\n\n1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:34.940\n and having a conversation with Vladimir Putin,\n\n1:32:34.940 --> 1:32:36.040\n say, as a use case.\n\n1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:38.480\n Me, as a user, coming to you as a use case.\n\n1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:42.520\n We both speak each other's language.\n\n1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:45.040\n I speak Russian, he speaks English.\n\n1:32:45.040 --> 1:32:48.000\n How can we have that communication go well\n\n1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:49.400\n with the help of AI?\n\n1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:52.440\n I think it's such a beautiful and a powerful application\n\n1:32:52.440 --> 1:32:54.720\n of AI to connect the world,\n\n1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:57.560\n that bridge the gap, not necessarily between me and Putin,\n\n1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:01.020\n but people that don't have that shared language.\n\n1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:04.120\n Can you just speak about your vision with translation?\n\n1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:06.680\n Because I think that's a really exciting application.\n\n1:33:06.680 --> 1:33:08.000\n If you're trying to help people connect\n\n1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:09.400\n all around the world,\n\n1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:11.600\n a lot of content is produced in one language\n\n1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:14.720\n and people in all these other places are interested in it.\n\n1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:16.640\n So being able to translate that\n\n1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:20.560\n just unlocks a lot of value on a day to day basis.\n\n1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:24.400\n I mean, so the kind of AI around translation is interesting\n\n1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:27.880\n because it's gone through a bunch of iterations.\n\n1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:29.680\n But the basic state of the art\n\n1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:32.560\n is that you don't wanna go through\n\n1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:37.680\n different kind of intermediate symbolic\n\n1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:42.520\n representations of language or something like that.\n\n1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:46.920\n You basically wanna be able to map the concepts\n\n1:33:46.920 --> 1:33:49.300\n and basically go directly from one language to another.\n\n1:33:49.300 --> 1:33:53.040\n And you just can train bigger and bigger models\n\n1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:54.120\n in order to be able to do that.\n\n1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:58.160\n And that's where the research supercluster comes in\n\n1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:01.080\n is basically a lot of the trend in machine learning\n\n1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:03.400\n is just you're building bigger and bigger models\n\n1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:05.700\n and you just need a lot of computation to train them.\n\n1:34:05.700 --> 1:34:08.360\n So it's not that like the translation would run\n\n1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:12.080\n on the supercomputer, the training of the model,\n\n1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:15.800\n which could have billions or trillions of examples\n\n1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:18.200\n of just basically that.\n\n1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:22.360\n You're training models on this supercluster\n\n1:34:22.360 --> 1:34:27.120\n in days or weeks that might take a much longer period of time\n\n1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:28.120\n on a smaller cluster.\n\n1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:30.200\n So it just wouldn't be practical for most teams to do.\n\n1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:32.280\n But the translation work,\n\n1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:38.160\n we're basically getting from being able to go\n\n1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:40.900\n between about a hundred languages seamlessly today\n\n1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:46.740\n to being able to go to about 300 languages in the near term.\n\n1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:48.720\n So from any language to any other language.\n\n1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:49.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:53.880\n And part of the issue when you get closer to more languages\n\n1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:57.680\n is some of these get to be pretty,\n\n1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:01.920\n not very popular languages, right?\n\n1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:04.280\n Where there isn't that much content in them.\n\n1:35:04.280 --> 1:35:07.280\n So you end up having less data\n\n1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:10.960\n and you need to kind of use a model that you've built up\n\n1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:12.080\n around other examples.\n\n1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:14.040\n And this is one of the big questions around AI\n\n1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:16.680\n is like how generalizable can things be?\n\n1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:18.760\n And that I think is one of the things\n\n1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:19.800\n that's just kind of exciting here\n\n1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:21.300\n from a technical perspective.\n\n1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:23.800\n But capturing, we talked about this with the metaverse,\n\n1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:26.440\n capturing the magic of human to human interaction.\n\n1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:29.180\n So me and Putin, okay.\n\n1:35:29.180 --> 1:35:30.020\n Again, this is therapy session.\n\n1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:31.080\n I mean, it's a tough example\n\n1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:33.360\n because you actually both speak Russian and English.\n\n1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:34.200\n No, but that's.\n\n1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:35.020\n But in the future.\n\n1:35:35.020 --> 1:35:37.740\n I see it as a touring test of a kind\n\n1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:40.440\n because we would both like to have an AI that improves\n\n1:35:40.440 --> 1:35:42.240\n because I don't speak Russian that well.\n\n1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:44.200\n He doesn't speak English that well.\n\n1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:45.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:48.640\n It would be nice to outperform our abilities\n\n1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:50.640\n and it sets a really nice bar\n\n1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:53.600\n because I think AI can really help in translation\n\n1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.720\n for people that don't speak the language at all,\n\n1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:00.120\n but to actually capture the magic of the chemistry,\n\n1:36:00.120 --> 1:36:03.240\n the translation, which would make the metaverse\n\n1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:04.800\n super immersive.\n\n1:36:04.800 --> 1:36:05.840\n I mean, that's exciting.\n\n1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:08.700\n You remove the barrier of language, period.\n\n1:36:08.700 --> 1:36:11.240\n Yeah, so when people think about translation,\n\n1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:14.240\n I think a lot of that is they're thinking about text to text,\n\n1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:17.120\n but speech to speech, I think is a whole nother thing.\n\n1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:19.080\n And I mean, one of the big lessons on that,\n\n1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:22.120\n which I was referring to before is I think early models,\n\n1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:23.800\n it's like, all right, they take speech,\n\n1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:25.080\n they translate it to text,\n\n1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:26.680\n translate the text to another language\n\n1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:29.400\n and then kind of output that as speech in that language.\n\n1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:30.440\n And you don't wanna do that.\n\n1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:32.260\n You just wanna be able to go directly from speech\n\n1:36:32.260 --> 1:36:34.180\n in one language to speech in another language\n\n1:36:34.180 --> 1:36:36.400\n and build up the models to do that.\n\n1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:39.140\n And I mean, I think one of the,\n\n1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:40.760\n there have been,\n\n1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:42.860\n when you look at the progress in machine learning,\n\n1:36:42.860 --> 1:36:47.240\n there have been big advances in the techniques,\n\n1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:51.560\n some of the advances in self supervised learning,\n\n1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:52.920\n which I know you talked to Jan about\n\n1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:55.320\n and he's like one of the leading thinkers in this area.\n\n1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:57.560\n I just think that that stuff is really exciting,\n\n1:36:57.560 --> 1:36:59.840\n but then you couple that with the ability\n\n1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:02.480\n to just throw larger and larger amounts of compute\n\n1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:04.000\n at training these models.\n\n1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:05.600\n And you can just do a lot of things\n\n1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:09.360\n that were harder to do before.\n\n1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:12.960\n But we're asking more of our systems too, right?\n\n1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:14.880\n So if you think about the applications\n\n1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:18.400\n that we're gonna need for the metaverse,\n\n1:37:18.400 --> 1:37:19.400\n or think about it, okay,\n\n1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:21.480\n so let's talk about AR here for a second.\n\n1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:23.140\n You're gonna have these glasses,\n\n1:37:23.140 --> 1:37:24.760\n they're gonna look hopefully\n\n1:37:24.760 --> 1:37:28.140\n like a normal ish looking pair of glasses,\n\n1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:31.240\n but they're gonna be able to put holograms in the world\n\n1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:35.980\n and intermix virtual and physical objects in your scene.\n\n1:37:35.980 --> 1:37:39.080\n And one of the things that's gonna be unique about this\n\n1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:41.240\n compared to every other computing device\n\n1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:42.580\n that you've had before,\n\n1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:45.160\n is that this is gonna be the first computing device\n\n1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:47.560\n that has all the same signals\n\n1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:49.480\n about what's going on around you that you have.\n\n1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.480\n Right, so your phone,\n\n1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:54.140\n you can have it take a photo or a video,\n\n1:37:54.140 --> 1:37:56.600\n but I mean, these glasses are gonna,\n\n1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:57.480\n whenever you activate them,\n\n1:37:57.480 --> 1:37:59.000\n they're gonna be able to see what you see\n\n1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.240\n from your perspective,\n\n1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:01.540\n they're gonna be able to hear what you hear\n\n1:38:01.540 --> 1:38:03.440\n because the microphones and all that\n\n1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:05.800\n are gonna be right around where your ears are.\n\n1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:08.160\n So you're gonna want an AI assistant,\n\n1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:10.240\n that's a new kind of AI assistant\n\n1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:13.880\n that can basically help you process the world\n\n1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:17.040\n from this first person perspective\n\n1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:18.580\n or from the perspective that you have.\n\n1:38:18.580 --> 1:38:21.800\n And the utility of that is gonna be huge,\n\n1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:25.440\n but the kinds of AI models that we're gonna need\n\n1:38:25.440 --> 1:38:27.400\n are going to be just,\n\n1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:30.040\n I don't know, there's a lot that we're gonna need\n\n1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:31.840\n to basically make advances in.\n\n1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:33.760\n But I mean, but that's why I think these concepts\n\n1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:36.600\n of the metaverse and the advances in AI\n\n1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:38.720\n are so fundamentally interlinked\n\n1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:42.880\n that I mean, they're kind of enabling each other.\n\n1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:45.440\n Yeah, like the world builder is a really cool idea.\n\n1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:47.240\n Like you can be like a Bob Ross,\n\n1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:49.120\n like I'm gonna put a little tree right here.\n\n1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:49.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:49.940 --> 1:38:51.200\n I need a little tree, it's missing a little tree.\n\n1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:52.960\n And then, but at scale,\n\n1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:55.680\n like enriching your experience in all kinds of ways.\n\n1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:56.960\n You mentioned the assistant too,\n\n1:38:56.960 --> 1:39:00.020\n that's really interesting how you can have AI assistants\n\n1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:01.640\n helping you out on different levels\n\n1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:04.000\n of sort of intimacy of communication.\n\n1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:05.480\n It could be just like scheduling\n\n1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:08.120\n or it could be like almost like therapy.\n\n1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:09.880\n Clearly I need some.\n\n1:39:09.880 --> 1:39:11.160\n So let me ask you,\n\n1:39:11.160 --> 1:39:14.000\n you're one of the most successful people ever.\n\n1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.240\n You've built an incredible company\n\n1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:18.080\n that has a lot of impact.\n\n1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:21.820\n What advice do you have for young people today?\n\n1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:25.480\n How to live a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:30.420\n How to build something that can have a big positive impact\n\n1:39:30.420 --> 1:39:31.260\n on the world?\n\n1:39:31.260 --> 1:39:36.260\n Well, let's break that down.\n\n1:39:37.460 --> 1:39:41.300\n Cause I think you proud of, have a big positive impact.\n\n1:39:41.300 --> 1:39:42.320\n Well, you're actually listening.\n\n1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:43.880\n And how to live your life\n\n1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:47.580\n are actually three different things that I think,\n\n1:39:47.580 --> 1:39:48.900\n I mean, they could line up,\n\n1:39:48.900 --> 1:39:52.460\n but, and also like what age of people are you talking to?\n\n1:39:52.460 --> 1:39:53.500\n Cause I mean, I can like.\n\n1:39:53.500 --> 1:39:54.700\n High school and college.\n\n1:39:54.700 --> 1:39:56.500\n So you don't really know what you're doing,\n\n1:39:56.500 --> 1:39:58.220\n but your dream big.\n\n1:39:58.220 --> 1:40:02.280\n And you really have a chance to do something unprecedented.\n\n1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:03.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:04.180 --> 1:40:05.020\n So I guess just to.\n\n1:40:05.020 --> 1:40:06.300\n Also for people my age.\n\n1:40:06.300 --> 1:40:09.620\n Okay, so let's maybe start with the kind of most\n\n1:40:09.620 --> 1:40:12.060\n philosophical and abstract version of this.\n\n1:40:12.060 --> 1:40:16.220\n Every night when I put my daughters to bed,\n\n1:40:16.220 --> 1:40:18.420\n we go through this thing and like,\n\n1:40:20.380 --> 1:40:21.740\n they call it the good night things.\n\n1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:25.440\n Cause we're basically what we talk about at night.\n\n1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:29.700\n And I just, I go through them.\n\n1:40:29.700 --> 1:40:31.460\n Sounds like a good show.\n\n1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:32.700\n The good night things.\n\n1:40:32.700 --> 1:40:33.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:33.540 --> 1:40:34.360\n Priscilla's always asking, she's like,\n\n1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:35.200\n can I get good night things?\n\n1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:36.040\n Like, I don't know.\n\n1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:37.100\n You go to bed too early.\n\n1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:37.940\n But it's,\n\n1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:44.960\n but I basically go through with Max and Augie,\n\n1:40:46.340 --> 1:40:48.940\n what are the things that are most important in life?\n\n1:40:48.940 --> 1:40:49.780\n Right.\n\n1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:51.560\n That I just, it's like, what do I want them to remember\n\n1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:53.940\n and just have like really ingrained in them as they grow up?\n\n1:40:53.940 --> 1:40:56.740\n And it's health, right?\n\n1:40:56.740 --> 1:40:58.800\n Making sure that you take care of yourself\n\n1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:00.700\n and keep yourself in good shape,\n\n1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:02.940\n loving friends and family, right?\n\n1:41:02.940 --> 1:41:05.380\n Because having the relationships,\n\n1:41:05.380 --> 1:41:08.700\n the family and making time for friends,\n\n1:41:08.700 --> 1:41:12.900\n I think is perhaps one of the most important things.\n\n1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:16.040\n And then the third is maybe a little more amorphous,\n\n1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:19.420\n but it is something that you're excited about for the future.\n\n1:41:19.420 --> 1:41:21.300\n And when I'm talking to a four year old,\n\n1:41:21.300 --> 1:41:23.500\n often I'll ask her what she's excited about\n\n1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:25.220\n for tomorrow or the week ahead.\n\n1:41:25.220 --> 1:41:29.580\n But I think for most people, it's really hard.\n\n1:41:29.580 --> 1:41:31.440\n I mean, the world is a heavy place.\n\n1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:34.780\n And I think like the way that we navigate it\n\n1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:37.340\n is that we have things that we're looking forward to.\n\n1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:41.620\n So whether it is building AR glasses for the future\n\n1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:45.520\n or being able to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary\n\n1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:47.380\n with my wife that's coming up,\n\n1:41:47.380 --> 1:41:48.620\n it's like, I think people,\n\n1:41:48.620 --> 1:41:51.860\n you know, you have things that you're looking forward to.\n\n1:41:51.860 --> 1:41:53.860\n Or for the girls, it's often I want to see mom\n\n1:41:53.860 --> 1:41:54.700\n in the morning, right?\n\n1:41:54.700 --> 1:41:57.020\n It's just, but it's like that's a really critical thing.\n\n1:41:57.020 --> 1:42:00.340\n And then the last thing is I ask them every day,\n\n1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:02.640\n what did you do today to help someone?\n\n1:42:04.340 --> 1:42:07.140\n Because I just think that that's a really critical thing\n\n1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:10.740\n is like, it's easy to kind of get caught up in yourself\n\n1:42:10.740 --> 1:42:14.300\n and kind of stuff that's really far down the road,\n\n1:42:14.300 --> 1:42:17.520\n but like, did you do something just concrete today\n\n1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:18.360\n to help someone?\n\n1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:21.060\n And, you know, it can just be as simple as, okay, yeah,\n\n1:42:21.060 --> 1:42:23.420\n I helped set the table for lunch, right?\n\n1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:26.440\n Or, you know, this other kid in our school\n\n1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:27.900\n was having a hard time with something\n\n1:42:27.900 --> 1:42:29.260\n and I like helped explain it to him.\n\n1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:32.940\n But in that those are, that's sort of like,\n\n1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:36.080\n if you were to boil down my overall life philosophy\n\n1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:40.140\n into what I try to impart to my kids,\n\n1:42:40.140 --> 1:42:43.000\n those are the things that I think are really important.\n\n1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.320\n So, okay, so let's say college.\n\n1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:45.860\n So if you're a graduate in college,\n\n1:42:45.860 --> 1:42:50.860\n probably more practical advice, I'm always very focused\n\n1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:53.180\n on people.\n\n1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:57.140\n And I think the most important decision\n\n1:42:57.140 --> 1:42:59.320\n you're probably gonna make if you're in college\n\n1:42:59.320 --> 1:43:01.620\n is who you surround yourself with,\n\n1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.960\n because you become like the people\n\n1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:04.620\n you surround yourself with.\n\n1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:09.620\n And I sort of have this hiring heuristic at Metta,\n\n1:43:09.620 --> 1:43:13.620\n which is that I will only hire someone to work for me\n\n1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:17.220\n if I could see myself working for them.\n\n1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:19.020\n Not necessarily that I want them to run the company\n\n1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:22.420\n because I like my job, but in an alternate universe,\n\n1:43:22.420 --> 1:43:23.980\n if it was their company and I was looking\n\n1:43:23.980 --> 1:43:27.060\n to go work somewhere, would I be happy to work for them?\n\n1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:30.220\n And I think that that's a helpful heuristic\n\n1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:33.060\n to help balance, you know,\n\n1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:33.900\n when you're building something like this,\n\n1:43:33.900 --> 1:43:36.060\n there's a lot of pressure to, you know,\n\n1:43:36.060 --> 1:43:37.380\n you wanna build out your team,\n\n1:43:37.380 --> 1:43:39.620\n because there's a lot of stuff that you need to get done.\n\n1:43:39.620 --> 1:43:41.860\n And everyone always says, don't compromise on quality,\n\n1:43:41.860 --> 1:43:42.940\n but there's this question of, okay,\n\n1:43:42.940 --> 1:43:44.020\n well, how do you know that someone is good enough?\n\n1:43:44.020 --> 1:43:46.860\n And I think my answer is, I would want someone\n\n1:43:46.860 --> 1:43:50.660\n to be on my team if I would work for them.\n\n1:43:50.660 --> 1:43:53.300\n But I think it's actually a pretty similar answer\n\n1:43:53.300 --> 1:43:58.300\n to like, if you were choosing friends or a partner\n\n1:43:58.300 --> 1:43:59.460\n or something like that.\n\n1:43:59.460 --> 1:44:01.900\n So when you're kind of in college,\n\n1:44:01.900 --> 1:44:03.580\n trying to figure out what your circle is gonna be,\n\n1:44:03.580 --> 1:44:04.420\n trying to figure out, you know,\n\n1:44:04.420 --> 1:44:05.260\n you're evaluating data,\n\n1:44:05.260 --> 1:44:07.620\n your circle is gonna be trying to figure out, you know,\n\n1:44:07.620 --> 1:44:09.300\n you're evaluating different job opportunities.\n\n1:44:09.300 --> 1:44:12.980\n Who are the people, even if they're gonna be peers\n\n1:44:12.980 --> 1:44:14.420\n in what you're doing,\n\n1:44:14.420 --> 1:44:17.020\n who are the people who in an alternate university,\n\n1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:18.700\n you would wanna work for them,\n\n1:44:18.700 --> 1:44:20.420\n because you think you're gonna learn a lot from them,\n\n1:44:20.420 --> 1:44:24.180\n because they know, because they are kind of values aligned\n\n1:44:24.180 --> 1:44:25.500\n on the things that you care about,\n\n1:44:25.500 --> 1:44:28.260\n and they're gonna like, and they're gonna push you,\n\n1:44:28.260 --> 1:44:29.500\n but also they know different things\n\n1:44:29.500 --> 1:44:30.660\n and have different experiences\n\n1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:32.940\n that are kind of more of what you wanna become like\n\n1:44:32.940 --> 1:44:33.780\n over time.\n\n1:44:33.780 --> 1:44:37.020\n But I don't know, I think probably people are too,\n\n1:44:37.020 --> 1:44:39.100\n in general, objective focused,\n\n1:44:39.100 --> 1:44:42.700\n and maybe not focused enough on the connections\n\n1:44:42.700 --> 1:44:46.620\n and the people who they're basically building relationships\n\n1:44:46.620 --> 1:44:47.460\n with.\n\n1:44:47.460 --> 1:44:48.300\n I don't know what it says about me,\n\n1:44:48.300 --> 1:44:53.300\n but my place in Austin now has seven legged robots.\n\n1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:55.420\n So I'm surrounded myself by robots,\n\n1:44:55.420 --> 1:44:59.140\n which is probably something I should look into.\n\n1:44:59.140 --> 1:45:02.500\n What kind of world would you like to see your daughters\n\n1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:05.460\n grow up in, even after you're gone?\n\n1:45:09.300 --> 1:45:11.500\n Well, I think one of the promises of all the stuff\n\n1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:15.580\n that is getting built now is that it can be a world\n\n1:45:15.580 --> 1:45:20.580\n where more people can just live out their imagination.\n\n1:45:21.780 --> 1:45:23.420\n One of my favorite quotes,\n\n1:45:23.420 --> 1:45:25.140\n I think it was attributed to Picasso,\n\n1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:26.780\n it's that all children are artists,\n\n1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:28.340\n and the challenge is how do you remain one\n\n1:45:28.340 --> 1:45:29.580\n when you grow up?\n\n1:45:29.580 --> 1:45:33.620\n And if you have kids, this is pretty clear,\n\n1:45:33.620 --> 1:45:36.260\n I mean, they just have wonderful imaginations.\n\n1:45:36.260 --> 1:45:38.980\n And part of what I think is gonna be great\n\n1:45:38.980 --> 1:45:41.380\n about the creator economy and the metaverse\n\n1:45:41.380 --> 1:45:44.740\n and all this stuff is this notion around\n\n1:45:44.740 --> 1:45:46.300\n that a lot more people in the future\n\n1:45:46.300 --> 1:45:49.020\n are gonna get to work doing creative stuff\n\n1:45:49.020 --> 1:45:51.420\n than what I think today we would just consider\n\n1:45:51.420 --> 1:45:53.740\n traditional labor or service.\n\n1:45:53.740 --> 1:45:56.300\n And I think that that's awesome.\n\n1:45:56.300 --> 1:46:00.140\n And that's a lot of what people are here to do\n\n1:46:00.140 --> 1:46:03.140\n is collaborate together, work together,\n\n1:46:03.140 --> 1:46:06.420\n think of things that you wanna build and go do it.\n\n1:46:06.420 --> 1:46:08.540\n And I don't know, one of the things\n\n1:46:08.540 --> 1:46:09.380\n that I just think is striking,\n\n1:46:09.380 --> 1:46:13.660\n so I teach my daughters some basic coding with Scratch.\n\n1:46:13.660 --> 1:46:15.420\n I mean, they're still obviously really young,\n\n1:46:15.420 --> 1:46:18.340\n but I think of coding as building,\n\n1:46:18.340 --> 1:46:19.780\n where it's like when I'm coding,\n\n1:46:19.780 --> 1:46:22.300\n I'm building something that I want to exist.\n\n1:46:22.300 --> 1:46:27.300\n But my youngest daughter, she's very musical\n\n1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:32.820\n and pretty artistic and she thinks about coding as art.\n\n1:46:32.820 --> 1:46:35.540\n She calls it code art, not the code,\n\n1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:37.540\n but the output of what she is making.\n\n1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:39.340\n It's like, she's just very interesting visually\n\n1:46:39.340 --> 1:46:42.580\n in what she can kind of output and how it can move around.\n\n1:46:42.580 --> 1:46:45.020\n And do we need to fix that?\n\n1:46:45.020 --> 1:46:45.860\n Are we good?\n\n1:46:45.860 --> 1:46:47.460\n What happened?\n\n1:46:47.460 --> 1:46:49.460\n Do we have to clap, Alexa?\n\n1:46:49.460 --> 1:46:53.020\n Yeah, so I was just talking about Augie and her code art,\n\n1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:56.540\n but I mean, to me, this is like a beautiful thing, right?\n\n1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.700\n The notion that like for me,\n\n1:46:58.700 --> 1:47:01.380\n coding was this functional thing and I enjoyed it.\n\n1:47:01.380 --> 1:47:04.620\n And it like helped build something utilitarian,\n\n1:47:04.620 --> 1:47:06.820\n but that for the next generation of people,\n\n1:47:06.820 --> 1:47:10.460\n it will be even more an expression\n\n1:47:10.460 --> 1:47:14.900\n of their kind of imagination and artistic sense\n\n1:47:14.900 --> 1:47:15.940\n for what they want to exist.\n\n1:47:15.940 --> 1:47:17.620\n So I don't know if that happens,\n\n1:47:17.620 --> 1:47:20.420\n if we can help bring about this world\n\n1:47:20.420 --> 1:47:23.580\n where a lot more people can,\n\n1:47:23.580 --> 1:47:25.900\n that that's like their existence going forward\n\n1:47:25.900 --> 1:47:28.620\n is being able to basically create\n\n1:47:28.620 --> 1:47:32.940\n and live out all these different kinds of art.\n\n1:47:32.940 --> 1:47:34.420\n I just think that that's like a beautiful\n\n1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:37.940\n and wonderful thing and will be very freeing for humanity\n\n1:47:37.940 --> 1:47:40.420\n to spend more of our time on the things that matter to us.\n\n1:47:40.420 --> 1:47:43.140\n Yeah, allow more and more people to express their art\n\n1:47:43.140 --> 1:47:45.140\n in the full meaning of that word.\n\n1:47:45.140 --> 1:47:46.900\n That's a beautiful vision.\n\n1:47:46.900 --> 1:47:49.300\n We mentioned that you are mortal.\n\n1:47:50.260 --> 1:47:51.900\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:53.580\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n1:47:56.300 --> 1:47:57.820\n And are you afraid of it?\n\n1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:03.100\n You didn't sign up for this on a podcast, did you?\n\n1:48:03.100 --> 1:48:05.100\n No, I mean, it's an interesting question.\n\n1:48:07.060 --> 1:48:08.700\n I mean, I'm definitely aware of it.\n\n1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:13.700\n I do a fair amount of like extreme sport type stuff.\n\n1:48:13.700 --> 1:48:18.700\n So like, so I'm definitely aware of it.\n\n1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:22.220\n And you're flirting with it a bit.\n\n1:48:22.220 --> 1:48:23.700\n I train hard.\n\n1:48:23.700 --> 1:48:25.100\n I mean, so it's like, if I'm gonna go out\n\n1:48:25.100 --> 1:48:27.700\n in like a 15 foot wave.\n\n1:48:27.700 --> 1:48:28.540\n Go out big.\n\n1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:29.700\n Well, then it's like, all right,\n\n1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:31.540\n I'll make sure we have the right safety gear\n\n1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:34.540\n and like make sure that I'm like used to that spot\n\n1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:35.580\n and all that stuff.\n\n1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:37.740\n But like, but you know, I mean, you.\n\n1:48:37.740 --> 1:48:38.940\n The risk is still there.\n\n1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:40.780\n You take some head blows along the way.\n\n1:48:40.780 --> 1:48:44.380\n Yes, but definitely aware of it.\n\n1:48:45.340 --> 1:48:48.020\n Definitely would like to stay safe.\n\n1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:52.020\n I have a lot of stuff that I want to build and want to.\n\n1:48:52.020 --> 1:48:54.180\n Does it freak you out that it's finite though?\n\n1:48:55.460 --> 1:48:57.660\n That there's a deadline when it's all over\n\n1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:01.500\n and that there'll be a time when your daughters are around\n\n1:49:01.500 --> 1:49:03.060\n and you're gone?\n\n1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:03.900\n I don't know.\n\n1:49:03.900 --> 1:49:04.940\n That doesn't freak me out.\n\n1:49:04.940 --> 1:49:09.780\n I think, I don't know.\n\n1:49:09.780 --> 1:49:14.780\n Constraints are helpful.\n\n1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:17.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:20.260\n Yeah, the finiteness makes ice cream\n\n1:49:20.260 --> 1:49:21.740\n taste more delicious somehow.\n\n1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:23.140\n The fact that it's gonna be over.\n\n1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:25.700\n There's something about that with the metaverse too.\n\n1:49:25.700 --> 1:49:28.500\n You want, we talked about this identity earlier,\n\n1:49:28.500 --> 1:49:30.260\n like having just one, like NFTs.\n\n1:49:30.260 --> 1:49:34.340\n There's something powerful about the constraint\n\n1:49:34.340 --> 1:49:36.900\n of finiteness or uniqueness.\n\n1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:39.740\n That this moment is singular in history.\n\n1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:41.060\n But I mean, a lot of,\n\n1:49:41.060 --> 1:49:42.700\n as you go through different waves of technology,\n\n1:49:42.700 --> 1:49:44.340\n I think a lot of what is interesting is\n\n1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:48.020\n what becomes in practice infinite\n\n1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:51.500\n or kind of there can be many, many of a thing\n\n1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:53.660\n and then what ends up still being constrained.\n\n1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:58.660\n So the metaverse should hopefully allow\n\n1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:04.220\n a very large number or maybe in practice,\n\n1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:06.860\n hopefully close to an infinite amount of expression\n\n1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:09.700\n and worlds, but we'll still only have\n\n1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:11.220\n a finite amount of time.\n\n1:50:11.220 --> 1:50:12.060\n Yes.\n\n1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:17.060\n I think living longer I think is good.\n\n1:50:18.020 --> 1:50:21.700\n And obviously all of my, our philanthropic work is,\n\n1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:23.380\n it's not focused on longevity,\n\n1:50:23.380 --> 1:50:25.940\n but it is focused on trying to achieve\n\n1:50:25.940 --> 1:50:29.620\n what I think is a possible goal in this century,\n\n1:50:29.620 --> 1:50:31.020\n which is to be able to cure, prevent\n\n1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:32.500\n or manage all diseases.\n\n1:50:33.460 --> 1:50:36.140\n So I certainly think people kind of getting sick\n\n1:50:36.140 --> 1:50:37.740\n and dying is a bad thing because,\n\n1:50:37.740 --> 1:50:40.260\n and I'm dedicating almost all of my capital\n\n1:50:40.260 --> 1:50:44.500\n towards advancing research in that area to push on that,\n\n1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:45.460\n which I mean, we could do a whole,\n\n1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:46.940\n another one of these podcasts about that\n\n1:50:46.940 --> 1:50:49.660\n because that's a fascinating topic.\n\n1:50:49.660 --> 1:50:51.740\n I mean, this is with your wife Priscilla Chan,\n\n1:50:51.740 --> 1:50:54.140\n you formed the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative,\n\n1:50:54.140 --> 1:50:57.020\n gave away 99% or pledged to give away 99%\n\n1:50:57.020 --> 1:50:59.260\n of Facebook non meta shares.\n\n1:50:59.260 --> 1:51:01.980\n I mean, like you said, we could talk forever\n\n1:51:01.980 --> 1:51:06.100\n about all the exciting things you're working on there,\n\n1:51:06.100 --> 1:51:11.100\n including the sort of moonshot of eradicating disease\n\n1:51:11.300 --> 1:51:13.260\n by the mid century marker.\n\n1:51:13.260 --> 1:51:15.420\n I don't actually know if you're gonna ever eradicate it,\n\n1:51:15.420 --> 1:51:17.980\n but I think you can get to a point where you\n\n1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:20.900\n can either cure things that happened, right?\n\n1:51:20.900 --> 1:51:22.940\n So people get diseases, but you can cure them.\n\n1:51:22.940 --> 1:51:25.620\n Prevent is probably closest to eradication\n\n1:51:25.620 --> 1:51:28.860\n or just be able to manage as sort of like ongoing things\n\n1:51:28.860 --> 1:51:33.260\n that are not gonna ruin your life.\n\n1:51:33.260 --> 1:51:34.300\n And I think that that's possible.\n\n1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:37.060\n I think saying that there's gonna be no disease at all\n\n1:51:37.060 --> 1:51:41.540\n probably is not possible within the next several decades.\n\n1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:44.300\n Basic thing is increase the quality of life\n\n1:51:44.300 --> 1:51:46.820\n and maybe keep the finiteness\n\n1:51:46.820 --> 1:51:50.180\n because it makes everything taste more delicious.\n\n1:51:50.180 --> 1:51:54.740\n Maybe that's just being a romantic 20th century human.\n\n1:51:54.740 --> 1:51:57.140\n Maybe, but I mean, but it was an intentional decision\n\n1:51:57.140 --> 1:52:01.780\n to not focus on our philanthropy on like explicitly\n\n1:52:01.780 --> 1:52:03.460\n on longevity or living forever.\n\n1:52:03.460 --> 1:52:04.300\n Yes.\n\n1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:09.060\n If at the moment of your death, and by the way,\n\n1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:11.540\n I like that the lights went out\n\n1:52:11.540 --> 1:52:13.380\n when we started talking about death.\n\n1:52:13.380 --> 1:52:14.220\n You get to meet God.\n\n1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:15.660\n It does make it a lot more dramatic.\n\n1:52:15.660 --> 1:52:16.500\n It does.\n\n1:52:17.940 --> 1:52:19.740\n I should get closer to the mic.\n\n1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:22.060\n At the moment of your death, you get to meet God\n\n1:52:23.020 --> 1:52:26.140\n and you get to ask one question.\n\n1:52:26.140 --> 1:52:28.100\n What question would you like to ask?\n\n1:52:29.820 --> 1:52:31.180\n Or maybe a whole conversation.\n\n1:52:31.180 --> 1:52:32.020\n I don't know.\n\n1:52:32.020 --> 1:52:32.860\n It's up to you.\n\n1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:35.060\n It's more dramatic when it's just one question.\n\n1:52:37.100 --> 1:52:40.500\n Well, if it's only one question and I died,\n\n1:52:42.980 --> 1:52:47.980\n I would just wanna know that Priscilla and my family,\n\n1:52:48.020 --> 1:52:49.660\n like if they were gonna be okay.\n\n1:52:50.900 --> 1:52:54.620\n That might depend on the circumstances of my death.\n\n1:52:54.620 --> 1:52:58.060\n But I think that in most circumstances that I can think of,\n\n1:52:58.060 --> 1:53:01.100\n that's probably the main thing that I would care about.\n\n1:53:01.100 --> 1:53:02.820\n Yeah, I think God will hear that question and be like,\n\n1:53:02.820 --> 1:53:04.260\n all right, fine, you get in.\n\n1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:06.700\n That's the right question to ask.\n\n1:53:06.700 --> 1:53:07.540\n Is it?\n\n1:53:07.540 --> 1:53:08.380\n I don't know.\n\n1:53:08.380 --> 1:53:09.580\n The humility and selfishness.\n\n1:53:09.580 --> 1:53:10.820\n All right, you're in.\n\n1:53:10.820 --> 1:53:14.540\n I mean, but well, maybe.\n\n1:53:14.540 --> 1:53:15.380\n They're gonna be fine.\n\n1:53:15.380 --> 1:53:16.220\n Don't worry, you're in.\n\n1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:18.220\n Okay, but I mean, one of the things that I think\n\n1:53:18.220 --> 1:53:22.300\n I struggle with at least is on the one hand,\n\n1:53:22.300 --> 1:53:25.620\n that's probably the thing that's closest to me\n\n1:53:25.620 --> 1:53:29.420\n and maybe the most common human experience.\n\n1:53:29.420 --> 1:53:32.380\n But I don't know, one of the things that I just struggle with\n\n1:53:32.380 --> 1:53:36.140\n in terms of running this large enterprise is like,\n\n1:53:38.100 --> 1:53:41.020\n should the thing that I care more about\n\n1:53:41.020 --> 1:53:44.860\n be that responsibility?\n\n1:53:44.860 --> 1:53:49.300\n And I think it's shifted over time.\n\n1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:52.060\n I mean, like before I really had a family\n\n1:53:52.060 --> 1:53:53.860\n that was like the only thing I cared about.\n\n1:53:53.860 --> 1:53:58.860\n And at this point, I mean, I care deeply about it,\n\n1:53:59.980 --> 1:54:04.980\n but yeah, I think that that's not as obvious of a question.\n\n1:54:06.060 --> 1:54:07.860\n Yeah, we humans are weird.\n\n1:54:07.860 --> 1:54:12.780\n You get this ability to impact millions of lives\n\n1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:15.660\n and it's definitely something, billions of lives,\n\n1:54:15.660 --> 1:54:16.980\n it's something you care about,\n\n1:54:16.980 --> 1:54:21.100\n but the weird humans that are closest to us,\n\n1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:23.700\n those are the ones that mean the most.\n\n1:54:23.700 --> 1:54:26.140\n And I suppose that's the dream of the metaverse\n\n1:54:26.140 --> 1:54:29.300\n is to connect, form small groups like that\n\n1:54:29.300 --> 1:54:31.700\n where you can have those intimate relationships.\n\n1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:33.620\n Let me ask you the big, ridiculous.\n\n1:54:33.620 --> 1:54:35.340\n Well, and to be able to be close,\n\n1:54:36.940 --> 1:54:39.900\n not just based on who you happen to be next to.\n\n1:54:39.900 --> 1:54:41.980\n I think that's what the internet is already doing\n\n1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:44.540\n is allowing you to spend more of your time\n\n1:54:44.540 --> 1:54:46.540\n not physically proximate.\n\n1:54:46.540 --> 1:54:49.940\n I mean, I always think when you think about the metaverse,\n\n1:54:49.940 --> 1:54:52.140\n people ask this question about the real world.\n\n1:54:52.140 --> 1:54:54.860\n It's like the virtual world versus the real world.\n\n1:54:54.860 --> 1:54:58.180\n And it's like, no, the real world is a combination\n\n1:54:58.180 --> 1:55:00.100\n of the virtual world and the physical world.\n\n1:55:00.100 --> 1:55:03.140\n But I think over time, as we get more technology,\n\n1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:06.780\n the physical world is becoming less of a percent\n\n1:55:06.780 --> 1:55:08.180\n of the real world.\n\n1:55:08.180 --> 1:55:10.940\n And I think that that opens up a lot of opportunities\n\n1:55:10.940 --> 1:55:13.460\n for people, because you can work in different places.\n\n1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:17.580\n You can stay more close to, stay closer to people\n\n1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:18.420\n who are in different places.\n\n1:55:18.420 --> 1:55:19.300\n So I think that's good.\n\n1:55:19.300 --> 1:55:21.380\n Removing barriers of geography\n\n1:55:21.380 --> 1:55:23.140\n and then barriers of language.\n\n1:55:23.140 --> 1:55:24.900\n That's a beautiful vision.\n\n1:55:25.860 --> 1:55:27.580\n Big, ridiculous question.\n\n1:55:27.580 --> 1:55:29.620\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n1:55:44.100 --> 1:55:46.560\n I think that, well, there are probably a couple\n\n1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:51.560\n of different ways that I would go at this.\n\n1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:53.900\n But I think it gets back to this last question\n\n1:55:53.900 --> 1:55:55.380\n that we talked about, about the duality\n\n1:55:55.380 --> 1:55:58.660\n between you have the people around you\n\n1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:00.380\n who you care the most about,\n\n1:56:00.380 --> 1:56:03.060\n and then there's like this bigger thing\n\n1:56:03.060 --> 1:56:04.420\n that maybe you're building.\n\n1:56:05.820 --> 1:56:07.340\n And I think that in my own life, I mean,\n\n1:56:07.340 --> 1:56:09.360\n I sort of think about this tension,\n\n1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:11.860\n but I mean, it's like, I started this whole company\n\n1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:15.100\n and my life's work is around human connection.\n\n1:56:15.100 --> 1:56:20.100\n So I think it's intellectually probably the thing\n\n1:56:22.100 --> 1:56:27.100\n that I go to first is just that human connection\n\n1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:28.560\n is the meaning.\n\n1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:31.160\n And I mean, I think that it's a thing\n\n1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:36.160\n that our society probably systematically undervalues.\n\n1:56:36.860 --> 1:56:39.280\n I mean, I just remember when I was growing up\n\n1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:43.140\n and in school, it's like, do your homework\n\n1:56:43.140 --> 1:56:45.200\n and then go play with your friends after.\n\n1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:47.020\n And it's like, no, well, what if playing\n\n1:56:47.020 --> 1:56:48.520\n with your friends is the point?\n\n1:56:50.180 --> 1:56:52.340\n That sounds like an argument your daughter would make.\n\n1:56:52.340 --> 1:56:54.620\n Well, I mean, I don't know, I just think it's interesting.\n\n1:56:54.620 --> 1:56:56.340\n Homework doesn't even matter, man.\n\n1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:58.540\n Well, I think it's interesting because it's,\n\n1:56:58.540 --> 1:57:02.700\n and people, I think people tend to think\n\n1:57:02.700 --> 1:57:05.180\n about that stuff as wasting time,\n\n1:57:05.180 --> 1:57:08.100\n or that's like what you do in the free time that you have.\n\n1:57:08.100 --> 1:57:11.140\n But like, what if that's actually the point?\n\n1:57:11.140 --> 1:57:12.580\n So that's one.\n\n1:57:12.580 --> 1:57:14.760\n But here's maybe a different way of counting out this,\n\n1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:17.880\n which is maybe more like religious in nature.\n\n1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:18.980\n I mean, I always like,\n\n1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:25.400\n there's a rabbi who I've studied with\n\n1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:26.920\n who kind of gave me this,\n\n1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:31.820\n we were talking through Genesis and the Bible and the Torah\n\n1:57:31.820 --> 1:57:36.100\n and they're basically walking through,\n\n1:57:36.100 --> 1:57:40.740\n it's like, okay, you go through the seven days of creation\n\n1:57:40.740 --> 1:57:45.660\n and it's basically, it's like,\n\n1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:48.100\n why does the Bible start there?\n\n1:57:48.100 --> 1:57:49.460\n Right, it's like it could have started anywhere,\n\n1:57:49.460 --> 1:57:52.000\n right, in terms of like how to live.\n\n1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.620\n But basically it starts with talking about\n\n1:57:54.620 --> 1:57:58.920\n how God created people in his, her image.\n\n1:58:00.560 --> 1:58:02.720\n But the Bible starts by talking about\n\n1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:04.740\n how God created everything.\n\n1:58:04.740 --> 1:58:11.240\n So I actually think that there's like a compelling argument\n\n1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:12.980\n that I think I've always just found meaningful\n\n1:58:12.980 --> 1:58:16.980\n and inspiring that a lot of the point\n\n1:58:18.400 --> 1:58:22.980\n of what sort of religion has been telling us\n\n1:58:22.980 --> 1:58:27.980\n that we should do is to create and build things.\n\n1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:32.100\n So these things are not necessarily at odds.\n\n1:58:32.100 --> 1:58:34.780\n I mean, I think like, I mean, that's,\n\n1:58:34.780 --> 1:58:36.100\n and I think probably to some degree\n\n1:58:36.100 --> 1:58:37.720\n you'd expect me to say something like this\n\n1:58:37.720 --> 1:58:39.760\n because I've dedicated my life to creating things\n\n1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:40.600\n that help people connect.\n\n1:58:40.600 --> 1:58:42.460\n So, I mean, that's sort of the fusion of,\n\n1:58:43.780 --> 1:58:45.260\n I mean, getting back to what we talked about earlier,\n\n1:58:45.260 --> 1:58:46.500\n it's, I mean, what I studied in school\n\n1:58:46.500 --> 1:58:48.260\n or psychology and computer science, right?\n\n1:58:48.260 --> 1:58:50.580\n So it's, I mean, these are like the two themes\n\n1:58:50.580 --> 1:58:54.460\n that I care about, but I don't know for me,\n\n1:58:54.460 --> 1:58:57.140\n that's kind of what I think about, that's what matters.\n\n1:58:57.140 --> 1:59:02.140\n To create and to love, which is the ultimate form\n\n1:59:02.200 --> 1:59:03.120\n of connection.\n\n1:59:03.980 --> 1:59:07.220\n I think this is one hell of an amazing replay experience\n\n1:59:07.220 --> 1:59:08.060\n in the metaverse.\n\n1:59:08.060 --> 1:59:11.980\n So whoever is using our avatars years from now,\n\n1:59:11.980 --> 1:59:14.780\n I hope you had fun and thank you for talking today.\n\n1:59:14.780 --> 1:59:15.620\n Thank you.\n\n1:59:16.460 --> 1:59:18.180\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:59:18.180 --> 1:59:19.500\n with Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n1:59:19.500 --> 1:59:22.060\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n1:59:22.060 --> 1:59:23.660\n in the description.\n\n1:59:23.660 --> 1:59:27.820\n And now, let me leave you with the end of the poem, If,\n\n1:59:27.820 --> 1:59:29.160\n by Roger Kipling.\n\n1:59:30.820 --> 1:59:34.160\n If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\n1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:37.820\n or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch,\n\n1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:41.220\n if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\n1:59:41.220 --> 1:59:45.740\n if all men count with you, but none too much.\n\n1:59:47.100 --> 1:59:49.260\n If you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\n1:59:49.260 --> 1:59:52.340\n with 60 seconds worth of distance run,\n\n1:59:52.340 --> 1:59:56.340\n yours is the earth and everything that's in it.\n\n1:59:56.340 --> 1:59:59.580\n And which is more, you'll be a man, my son.\n\n1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:21.100\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
