00:06.920\n like his book, Deep Work, for example,\n\n00:06.920 --> 00:09.600\n has guided how I strive to approach productivity\n\n00:09.600 --> 00:11.200\n and life in general.\n\n00:11.200 --> 00:13.120\n He doesn't use social media,\n\n00:13.120 --> 00:15.600\n and in his book, Digital Minimalism,\n\n00:15.600 --> 00:17.760\n he encourages people to find the right amount\n\n00:17.760 --> 00:21.120\n of social media usage that provides value and joy.\n\n00:21.120 --> 00:24.720\n He has a new book out called A World Without Email,\n\n00:24.720 --> 00:27.240\n where he argues brilliantly, I would say,\n\n00:27.240 --> 00:30.120\n that email is destroying productivity in companies\n\n00:30.120 --> 00:31.680\n and in our lives.\n\n00:31.680 --> 00:35.480\n And very importantly, he offers solutions.\n\n00:35.480 --> 00:38.720\n He is a computer scientist at Georgetown University\n\n00:38.720 --> 00:41.080\n who practices what he preaches.\n\n00:41.080 --> 00:42.840\n To do theoretical computer science\n\n00:42.840 --> 00:44.560\n at the level that he does it,\n\n00:44.560 --> 00:46.800\n you really have to live a focused life\n\n00:46.800 --> 00:48.320\n that minimizes distractions\n\n00:48.320 --> 00:51.120\n and maximizes hours of deep work.\n\n00:51.120 --> 00:54.360\n Lastly, he's a host of an amazing podcast\n\n00:54.360 --> 00:57.640\n called Deep Questions that I highly recommend\n\n00:57.640 --> 01:00.760\n for anyone who wants to improve their productive life.\n\n01:00.760 --> 01:02.880\n Quick mention of our

deep work\n\n01:17.440 --> 01:20.760\n or long periods of deep, focused thinking\n\n01:20.760 --> 01:22.800\n have been something I've been chasing more and more\n\n01:22.800 --> 01:24.520\n over the past few years.\n\n01:24.520 --> 01:28.040\n Deep work is hard, but is ultimately the thing\n\n01:28.040 --> 01:30.920\n that makes life so damn amazing.\n\n01:30.920 --> 01:33.760\n The ability to create things you're passionate about\n\n01:33.760 --> 01:36.400\n in a flow state where the distractions of the world\n\n01:36.400 --> 01:37.920\n just fade away.\n\n01:37.920 --> 01:41.520\n Social media, yes, reading the comments,\n\n01:41.520 --> 01:43.480\n yes, I still read the comments,\n\n01:43.480 --> 01:46.920\n is a source of joy for me in strict moderation.\n\n01:46.920 --> 01:49.200\n Too much takes away the focused mind\n\n01:49.200 --> 01:51.520\n and too little, at least I think,\n\n01:51.520 --> 01:53.720\n takes away all of the fun.\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:56.920\n We need both, the focus and the fun.\n\n01:56.920 --> 01:59.280\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:59.280 --> 02:02.720\n review it on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,\n\n02:02.720 -->

02:13.960\n And now, here's my conversation with Cal Newport.\n\n02:15.080 --> 02:16.600\n What is deep work?\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:18.920\n Let's start with a big question.\n\n02:18.920 --> 02:21.720\n So I mean, it's my term for when you're focusing\n\n02:21.720 --> 02:25.800\n without distraction on a cognitively demanding task,\n\n02:25.800 --> 02:28.440\n which is something we've all done,\n\n02:28.440 --> 02:31.640\n but we had never really given it a name necessarily\n\n02:31.640 --> 02:33.440\n that was separate from other type of work.\n\n02:33.440 --> 02:36.520\n And so I gave it a name and said,\n\n02:36.520 --> 02:38.440\n let's compare that to other types of efforts\n\n02:38.440 --> 02:40.640\n you might do while you're working\n\n02:40.640 --> 02:43.440\n and see that the deep work efforts actually have\n\n02:43.440 --> 02:45.800\n a huge benefit that we might be underestimating.\n\n02:45.800 --> 02:49.280\n What does it mean to work deeply on something?\n\n02:49.280 --> 02:54.280\n I had been calling it hard focus in my writing before that.\n\n02:54.280 --> 02:55.640\n Well, so the context you would understand,\n\n02:55.640 --> 02:58.320\n I was in the theory group in CSAIL at MIT, right?\n\n02:58.320 --> 02:59.920\n So I was surrounded at the time\n\n02:59.920 --> 03:01.760\n when I was coming up with these ideas\n\n03:01.760 --> 03:03.440\n by these professional theoreticians.\n\n03:03.440 --> 03:06.840\n And that's like a murderer's row of thinkers there, right?\n\n03:06.840 --> 03:08.880\n I mean, it's like Turing Award, Turing Award,\n\n03:08.880 --> 03:10.040\n MacArthur, Turing Award.\n\n03:10.040 --> 03:12.640\n I mean, you know the crew, right?\n\n03:12.640 --> 03:13.840\n Theoretical computer science.\n\n03:13.840 --> 03:15.840\n Theoretical computer science, yeah, yeah.\n\n03:15.840 --> 03:18.080\n So I'm in the theory group, right?\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:21.360\n Doing theoretical computer science and I publish a book.\n\n03:21.360 --> 03:25.400\n So I was in this milieu where I was being exposed to people\n\n03:25.400 --> 03:27.680\n where focus was their tier one skill.\n\n03:27.680 --> 03:29.040\n Like that's what you would talk about, right?\n\n03:29.040 --> 03:31.480\n Like how intensely I can focus.\n\n03:31.480 --> 03:33.360\n That was the key skill.\n\n03:33.360 --> 03:34.800\n It's like your 440 time or something\n\n03:34.800 --> 03:37.120\n if you were an athlete, right?\n\n03:37.120 --> 03:39.080\n So this is something that people actually,\n\n03:39.080 --> 03:41.680\n the theory folks are thinking about?\n\n03:41.680 --> 03:43.000\n Oh yeah. Really?\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:45.840\n Like they're openly discussing like, how do you focus?\n\n03:45.840 --> 03:48.480\n I mean, I don't know if they would quantify it,\n\n03:48.480 --> 03:51.520\n but focus was the tier one skill.\n\n03:51.520 --> 03:53.680\n So you would come in, here would be a typical day.\n\n03:53.680 --> 03:56.440\n You'd come in and Eric DeMain would be sitting\n\n03:56.440 --> 03:58.320\n in front of a whiteboard, right?\n\n03:58.320 --> 04:00.160\n With a whole group of visitors\n\n04:00.160 --> 04:01.280\n who had come to work with them.\n\n04:01.280 --> 04:03.640\n And maybe they projected like a grid on there\n\n04:03.640 --> 04:06.400\n because they're working on some graph theory problem.\n\n04:06.400 --> 04:10.000\n You go to lunch, you go to the gym, you come back,\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:12.960\n they're sitting there staring at the same whiteboard, right?\n\n04:12.960 --> 04:14.240\n Like that's the tier one skill.\n\n04:14.240 --> 04:16.120\n This is the difference between different disciplines.\n\n04:16.120 --> 04:20.640\n Like I often feel for many reasons, like a fraud,\n\n04:20.640 --> 04:22.760\n but I definitely feel like a fraud when I hang out\n\n04:22.760 --> 04:25.440\n with like either mathematicians or physicists.\n\n04:25.440 --> 04:29.000\n It's like, it feels like they're doing the legit work\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:31.240\n because when you talk closer in computer science,\n\n04:31.240 --> 04:33.840\n you get to programming or like machine learning,\n\n04:33.840 --> 04:38.440\n like the experimental machine learning\n\n04:38.440 --> 04:41.120\n or like just the engineering version of it.\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:44.560\n It feels like you're gone so far away\n\n04:44.560 --> 04:47.880\n from what's required to solve something fundamental\n\n04:47.880 --> 04:49.000\n about this universe.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:51.160\n It feels like you're just like cheating your way\n\n04:51.160 --> 04:53.560\n into like some kind of trick to figure out\n\n04:53.560 --> 04:56.200\n how to solve a problem in this one particular case.\n\n04:56.200 --> 04:57.400\n That's how it feels.\n\n04:59.160 --> 05:02.840\n I'd be interested to hear what you think about that\n\n05:02.840 --> 05:07.080\n because programming doesn't always feel\n\n05:07.080 --> 05:11.480\n like you need to think deeply to work deeply,\n\n05:11.480 --> 05:12.880\n but sometimes it does.\n\n05:12.880 --> 05:14.400\n So it's a weird dance.\n\n05:14.400 --> 05:15.840\n For sure code does, right?\n\n05:15.840 --> 05:17.640\n I mean, especially if you're coming up\n\n05:17.640 --> 05:20.760\n with original algorithmic designs,\n\n05:20.760 --> 05:22.800\n I think it's a great example of deep work.\n\n05:22.800 --> 05:25.080\n I mean, yeah, the hardcore theoreticians,\n\n05:25.080 --> 05:26.520\n they push it to an extreme.\n\n05:26.520 --> 05:29.080\n I mean, I think it's like knowing\n\n05:29.080 --> 05:31.160\n that athletic endeavor is good\n\n05:31.160 --> 05:33.840\n and then hanging out with a Olympic athlete,\n\n05:33.840 --> 05:35.760\n you're like, oh, I see that's what it is.\n\n05:35.760 --> 05:37.200\n Now for the grad students like me,\n\n05:37.200 --> 05:38.800\n we're not anywhere near that level,\n\n05:38.800 --> 05:41.640\n but the faculty in that group,\n\n05:41.640 --> 05:44.720\n these were the cognitive Olympic athletes.\n\n05:44.720 --> 05:48.160\n But coding I think is a classic example of deep work\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:50.960\n because I got this problem I wanna solve,\n\n05:50.960 --> 05:52.320\n I have all of these tools\n\n05:52.320 --> 05:55.880\n and I have to combine them somehow creatively\n\n05:55.880 --> 05:56.720\n and on the fly.\n\n05:56.720 --> 05:59.000\n But so basically I had been exposed to that.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:00.920\n So I was used to this notion when I was in grad school\n\n06:00.920 --> 06:03.560\n and I was writing my blog, I'd write about hard focus.\n\n06:03.560 --> 06:05.120\n That was the term I used.\n\n06:05.120 --> 06:06.640\n Then I published this book,\n\n06:06.640 --> 06:09.480\n So Good They Can't Ignore You, which came out in 2012.\n\n06:09.480 --> 06:12.240\n So like right as I began as a professor.\n\n06:12.240 --> 06:14.720\n And that book had this notion of skill\n\n06:14.720 --> 06:16.600\n being really important for career satisfaction,\n\n06:16.600 --> 06:19.440\n that it's not just following your passion.\n\n06:19.440 --> 06:21.120\n You have to actually really get good at something\n\n06:21.120 --> 06:22.600\n and then you use that skills as leverage.\n\n06:22.600 --> 06:24.480\n And there was this big followup question to that book\n\n06:24.480 --> 06:27.160\n of, okay, well, how do I get really good at things?\n\n06:27.160 --> 06:29.080\n And then I look back to my grad school experience,\n\n06:29.080 --> 06:31.600\n I was like, huh, there was this focus thing\n\n06:31.600 --> 06:32.440\n that we used to do.\n\n06:32.440 --> 06:35.480\n And I wonder how generally applicable that is\n\n06:35.480 --> 06:36.360\n into the knowledge sector.\n\n06:36.360 --> 06:39.240\n And so as I started thinking about it, it became clear,\n\n06:39.240 --> 06:41.040\n there's this interesting storyline that emerged\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:43.240\n that, okay, actually undistracted concentration\n\n06:43.240 --> 06:46.360\n is not just important for esoteric theoreticians,\n\n06:46.360 --> 06:47.520\n it's important here, it's important here,\n\n06:47.520 --> 06:48.800\n it's important here.\n\n06:48.800 --> 06:51.240\n And that involved into the deep work hypothesis,\n\n06:51.240 --> 06:55.280\n which is across the whole knowledge work sector.\n\n06:55.280 --> 06:56.600\n Focus is very important\n\n06:56.600 --> 06:58.600\n and we've accidentally created circumstances\n\n06:58.600 --> 07:00.560\n where we just don't do a lot of it.\n\n07:00.560 --> 07:03.680\n So focus is the sort of prerequisite for basically,\n\n07:03.680 --> 07:04.520\n you say knowledge work,\n\n07:04.520 --> 07:07.040\n but basically any kind of skill acquisition,\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:09.320\n any kind of major effort in this world.\n\n07:09.320 --> 07:11.640\n Can we break that apart a little bit?\n\n07:11.640 --> 07:15.760\n Yeah, so a key aspect of focus is not just\n\n07:15.760 --> 07:17.840\n that you're concentrating hard on something,\n\n07:17.840 --> 07:20.080\n but you do it without distraction.\n\n07:20.080 --> 07:24.720\n So a big theme of my work is that context shifting\n\n07:24.720 --> 07:27.000\n kills the human capacity to think.\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:29.520\n So if I change what I'm paying attention to\n\n07:29.520 --> 07:32.000\n to something different, really, even if it's brief\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:34.240\n and then try to bring it back to the main thing I'm doing,\n\n07:34.240 --> 07:36.000\n that causes a huge cognitive pile up\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:38.080\n that makes it very hard to think clearly.\n\n07:38.080 --> 07:40.360\n So even if you think, okay, look, I'm writing this code\n\n07:40.360 --> 07:43.600\n or I'm writing this essay and I'm not multitasking\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:45.080\n and all my windows are closed\n\n07:45.080 --> 07:47.080\n and I have no notifications on,\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:50.120\n but every five or six minutes you quickly check\n\n07:50.120 --> 07:51.880\n like an inbox or your phone,\n\n07:51.880 --> 07:54.200\n that initiates a context shift in your brain, right?\n\n07:54.200 --> 07:55.920\n We're gonna start to suppress some neural networks,\n\n07:55.920 --> 07:57.400\n we're gonna try to amplify some others.\n\n07:57.400 --> 07:59.240\n It's a pretty complicated process actually.\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:02.240\n There's a sort of neurological cascade that happens.\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:04.400\n You rip yourself away from that halfway through\n\n08:04.400 --> 08:05.480\n and go back to what you're doing\n\n08:05.480 --> 08:07.120\n and now it's trying to switch back to the original thing\n\n08:07.120 --> 08:08.760\n even though it's also your brain's in the process\n\n08:08.760 --> 08:09.920\n of switching to these emails\n\n08:09.920 --> 08:11.720\n and trying to understand those contexts.\n\n08:11.720 --> 08:14.600\n And as a result, your ability to think clearly\n\n08:14.600 --> 08:16.400\n just goes really down.\n\n08:16.400 --> 08:17.320\n And it's fatiguing too.\n\n08:17.320 --> 08:19.440\n I mean, you do this long enough and you get midday\n\n08:19.440 --> 08:22.080\n and you're like, okay, I can't think anymore.\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:23.240\n You've exhausted yourself.\n\n08:23.240 --> 08:27.920\n Is there some kind of perfect number of minutes,\n\n08:27.920 --> 08:28.880\n would you say?\n\n08:28.880 --> 08:32.320\n So we're talking about focusing on a particular task\n\n08:32.320 --> 08:37.240\n for one minute, five minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes.\n\n08:37.240 --> 08:40.160\n Is it possible to kind of context switch\n\n08:40.160 --> 08:44.280\n while maintaining deep focus every 20 minutes or so?\n\n08:44.280 --> 08:46.600\n So if you're thinking of like this,\n\n08:46.600 --> 08:48.720\n again, maybe it's a selfish kind of perspective,\n\n08:48.720 --> 08:50.440\n but if you think about programming,\n\n08:51.440 --> 08:53.680\n you're focused on a particular design of a little bit,\n\n08:53.680 --> 08:55.920\n maybe a small scale on a particular function\n\n08:55.920 --> 08:59.560\n or large scale on a system.\n\n08:59.560 --> 09:02.840\n And then the shift of focus happens like this,\n\n09:02.840 --> 09:04.960\n which is like, wait a minute,\n\n09:04.960 --> 09:07.440\n is there a library that can achieve this little task\n\n09:07.440 --> 09:08.280\n or something like that?\n\n09:08.280 --> 09:10.200\n And then you have to look it up.\n\n09:10.200 --> 09:11.480\n This is the danger zone.\n\n09:11.480 --> 09:13.040\n You go to the internets.\n\n09:13.040 --> 09:17.040\n And so you have to, now it is a kind of context switch\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:20.000\n because as opposed to thinking about the particular problem,\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:25.000\n you now have switch thinking about like consuming\n\n09:25.000 --> 09:27.880\n and integrating knowledge that's out there\n\n09:27.880 --> 09:31.120\n that can plug into your solution to a particular problem.\n\n09:31.120 --> 09:33.520\n It definitely feels like a context switch,\n\n09:33.520 --> 09:35.960\n but is that a really bad thing to do?\n\n09:35.960 --> 09:38.480\n So should you be setting it aside always\n\n09:38.480 --> 09:42.120\n and really trying to as much as possible go deep\n\n09:42.120 --> 09:45.920\n and stay there for like a really long period of time?\n\n09:45.920 --> 09:48.640\n Well, I mean, I think if you're looking up a library\n\n09:48.640 --> 09:51.320\n that's relevant to what you're doing, that's probably okay.\n\n09:51.320 --> 09:52.440\n And I don't know that I would count that\n\n09:52.440 --> 09:56.120\n as a full context shift because the semantic networks\n\n09:56.120 --> 09:58.000\n involved are relatively similar, right?\n\n09:58.000 --> 10:00.520\n You're thinking about this type of solution.\n\n10:00.520 --> 10:01.600\n You're thinking about coding.\n\n10:01.600 --> 10:03.560\n You're thinking about this type of functions.\n\n10:03.560 --> 10:04.600\n Where you're really gonna get hit\n\n10:04.600 --> 10:06.000\n is if you switch your context\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.000\n to something that's different.\n\n10:08.000 --> 10:09.800\n And if there's unresolved obligations.\n\n10:09.800 --> 10:11.680\n So really the worst possible thing you could do\n\n10:11.680 --> 10:14.320\n would be to look at like an email inbox, right?\n\n10:14.320 --> 10:16.000\n Cause here's 20 emails.\n\n10:16.000 --> 10:18.000\n I can't answer most of these right now.\n\n10:18.000 --> 10:19.520\n They're completely different.\n\n10:19.520 --> 10:21.160\n Like the context of these emails,\n\n10:21.160 --> 10:22.760\n like, okay, there's a grant funding issue\n\n10:22.760 --> 10:23.600\n or something like this.\n\n10:23.600 --> 10:25.520\n It's very different than the coding I'm doing.\n\n10:25.520 --> 10:27.200\n And I'm leaving it unresolved.\n\n10:27.200 --> 10:29.200\n So like someone needs something from me\n\n10:29.200 --> 10:30.680\n and I'm gonna try to pull my attention back.\n\n10:30.680 --> 10:31.840\n The second worst would be something\n\n10:31.840 --> 10:33.360\n that's emotionally arousing.\n\n10:33.360 --> 10:35.160\n So if you're like, let me just glance over at Twitter.\n\n10:35.160 --> 10:37.520\n I'm sure it's nice and calm and peaceful over there, right?\n\n10:37.520 --> 10:38.560\n That could be devastating\n\n10:38.560 --> 10:39.800\n because you're gonna expose yourself\n\n10:39.800 --> 10:41.560\n to something that's emotionally arousing.\n\n10:41.560 --> 10:43.920\n That's gonna completely mess up the cognitive plateau there.\n\n10:43.920 --> 10:45.040\n And then when you come back to,\n\n10:45.040 --> 10:46.920\n okay, let me try to code again.\n\n10:46.920 --> 10:47.840\n It's really difficult.\n\n10:47.840 --> 10:50.120\n So it's both the information and the emotion.\n\n10:50.120 --> 10:53.440\n Yeah, both can be killers if what you're trying to do.\n\n10:53.440 --> 10:55.960\n So I would recommend at least an hour at a time\n\n10:55.960 --> 10:57.600\n because it could take up to 20 minutes\n\n10:57.600 --> 10:59.320\n to completely clear out the residue\n\n10:59.320 --> 11:02.680\n from whatever it was you were thinking about before.\n\n11:02.680 --> 11:04.040\n So if you're coding for 30 minutes,\n\n11:04.040 --> 11:05.720\n you might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes\n\n11:05.720 --> 11:08.880\n of actual sort of peak lacks going on there, right?\n\n11:08.880 --> 11:11.840\n So an hour at least you get a good 40, 45 minutes plus.\n\n11:11.840 --> 11:15.560\n I'm partial to 90 minutes as a really good chunk.\n\n11:15.560 --> 11:16.960\n We can get a lot done.\n\n11:16.960 --> 11:18.640\n But just before you get exhausted,\n\n11:18.640 --> 11:21.200\n you can sort of pull back a little bit.\n\n11:21.200 --> 11:23.880\n Yeah, and one of the beautiful,\n\n11:23.880 --> 11:27.440\n people can read about it in your book, Deep Work.\n\n11:27.440 --> 11:29.520\n And I know this has been out for a long time\n\n11:29.520 --> 11:31.920\n and people are probably familiar with many of the concepts,\n\n11:31.920 --> 11:33.800\n but it's still pretty profound\n\n11:33.800 --> 11:35.840\n and it has stayed with me for a long time.\n\n11:36.880 --> 11:39.360\n There's something about adding the terms to it\n\n11:39.360 --> 11:42.120\n that actually solidifies the concepts.\n\n11:42.120 --> 11:44.320\n Like words matter, it's pretty cool.\n\n11:44.320 --> 11:47.600\n And just for me, sort of as a comment,\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:52.600\n there's, it's a struggle and it's very difficult\n\n11:52.640 --> 11:56.120\n to maintain focus for a prolonged period of time.\n\n11:56.120 --> 11:59.320\n But the days on which I'm able to accomplish\n\n11:59.320 --> 12:03.320\n several hours of that kind of work, I'm happy.\n\n12:03.320 --> 12:05.520\n So forget being productive and all that.\n\n12:05.520 --> 12:07.840\n I'm just satisfied with my life.\n\n12:07.840 --> 12:11.520\n I feel fulfilled, it's like joyful.\n\n12:11.520 --> 12:14.400\n And then I can be, I'm less of a dick\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:16.600\n to other people in my life afterwards.\n\n12:16.600 --> 12:19.120\n It's a beautiful thing.\n\n12:19.120 --> 12:23.800\n And I find the opposite when I don't do that kind of thing,\n\n12:23.800 --> 12:25.480\n I'm much more irritable.\n\n12:25.480 --> 12:27.320\n Like I feel like I didn't accomplish anything\n\n12:27.320 --> 12:30.120\n and there's this stress that then the negative emotion\n\n12:30.120 --> 12:32.040\n builds up to where you're no longer able\n\n12:32.040 --> 12:35.480\n to sort of enjoy the hell out of this amazing life.\n\n12:35.480 --> 12:37.880\n So in that sense, Deep Work has been a source\n\n12:37.880 --> 12:39.640\n of a lot of happiness.\n\n12:39.640 --> 12:42.280\n I'd love to ask you, how do you,\n\n12:42.280 --> 12:43.480\n again, you cover this in the book,\n\n12:43.480 --> 12:46.480\n but how do you integrate Deep Work into your life?\n\n12:46.480 --> 12:48.560\n What are different scheduling strategies\n\n12:48.560 --> 12:51.160\n that you would recommend just at a high level?\n\n12:51.160 --> 12:52.560\n What are different ideas there?\n\n12:52.560 --> 12:55.280\n Well, I mean, I'm a big fan of time blocking, right?\n\n12:55.280 --> 12:58.480\n So if you're facing your workday,\n\n12:58.480 --> 13:02.080\n don't allow like your inbox or a to do list\n\n13:02.080 --> 13:02.920\n to sort of drive you.\n\n13:02.920 --> 13:04.080\n Don't just come into your day and think,\n\n13:04.080 --> 13:05.840\n what do I wanna do next?\n\n13:05.840 --> 13:06.800\n I mean, I'm a big planner saying,\n\n13:06.800 --> 13:11.480\n here's the time available, let me make a plan for it.\n\n13:11.480 --> 13:13.400\n So I have a meeting here, I have an appointment here,\n\n13:13.400 --> 13:15.400\n here's what's left, what do I actually wanna do with it?\n\n13:15.400 --> 13:17.960\n So in this half hour, I'm gonna work on this.\n\n13:17.960 --> 13:19.680\n For this 90 minute block, I'm gonna work on that.\n\n13:19.680 --> 13:21.320\n And during this hour, I'm gonna try to fit this in.\n\n13:21.320 --> 13:22.680\n And then actually I have this half hour gap\n\n13:22.680 --> 13:23.520\n between two meetings.\n\n13:23.520 --> 13:24.680\n So why don't I take advantage of that\n\n13:24.680 --> 13:25.800\n to go run five errands,\n\n13:25.800 --> 13:27.720\n I can kind of batch those together.\n\n13:27.720 --> 13:30.120\n But blocking out in advance,\n\n13:30.120 --> 13:32.480\n this is what I wanna do with the time available.\n\n13:32.480 --> 13:33.760\n I mean, I find that's much more effective.\n\n13:33.760 --> 13:34.600\n Now, once you're doing this,\n\n13:34.600 --> 13:36.320\n once you're in a discipline of time blocking,\n\n13:36.320 --> 13:37.800\n it's much easier to actually see,\n\n13:37.800 --> 13:40.160\n this is where I want, for example, the Deep Work.\n\n13:40.160 --> 13:41.840\n And I can get a handle on the other things\n\n13:41.840 --> 13:44.920\n that need to happen and find better places to fit them\n\n13:44.920 --> 13:46.120\n so I can prioritize this.\n\n13:46.120 --> 13:48.560\n And you're gonna get a lot more of that done\n\n13:48.560 --> 13:49.680\n than if it's just going through your day\n\n13:49.680 --> 13:51.400\n and saying, what's next?\n\n13:51.400 --> 13:53.440\n I schedule every single day kind of thing.\n\n13:53.440 --> 13:54.920\n So as I could try to do in the morning\n\n13:54.920 --> 13:57.040\n to try to have a plan.\n\n13:57.040 --> 14:00.320\n Yeah, so I do a quarterly, weekly, daily planning.\n\n14:00.320 --> 14:02.360\n So at the semester or quarterly level,\n\n14:02.360 --> 14:04.840\n I have a big picture vision\n\n14:04.840 --> 14:06.800\n for what I'm trying to get done during the fall,\n\n14:06.800 --> 14:08.640\n let's say, or during the winter.\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:11.240\n Like there's a deadline coming up for academic papers\n\n14:11.240 --> 14:13.480\n at the end of the season, here's what I'm working on.\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:15.280\n I wanna have this many chapters done of a book,\n\n14:15.280 --> 14:16.120\n something like this.\n\n14:16.120 --> 14:18.200\n Like you have the big picture vision\n\n14:18.200 --> 14:20.040\n of what you wanna get done.\n\n14:20.040 --> 14:22.200\n Then weekly, you look at that,\n\n14:22.200 --> 14:23.920\n and then you look at your week\n\n14:23.920 --> 14:25.080\n and you put together a plan for like,\n\n14:25.080 --> 14:27.200\n okay, what's my week gonna look like?\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:28.320\n What do I need to do?\n\n14:28.320 --> 14:29.880\n How am I gonna make progress on these things?\n\n14:29.880 --> 14:32.640\n Maybe I need to do an hour every morning\n\n14:32.640 --> 14:34.640\n or I see that Monday is my only really empty day.\n\n14:34.640 --> 14:36.440\n So that's gonna be the day that I really need to nail\n\n14:36.440 --> 14:38.080\n on writing or something like this.\n\n14:38.080 --> 14:41.160\n And then every day, you look at your weekly plan\n\n14:41.160 --> 14:42.760\n and say, let me block off the actual hours.\n\n14:42.760 --> 14:44.760\n So you do that three scales,\n\n14:44.760 --> 14:47.880\n the quarterly, down to weekly, down to daily.\n\n14:47.880 --> 14:50.840\n And we're talking about actual times of day versus,\n\n14:50.840 --> 14:55.120\n so the alternative is what I end up doing a lot,\n\n14:55.120 --> 14:56.680\n and I'm not sure it's the best way to do it,\n\n14:56.680 --> 15:01.680\n is scheduling the duration of time.\n\n15:01.760 --> 15:04.560\n This is called the luxury when you don't have any meetings.\n\n15:04.560 --> 15:07.880\n I'm like, religiously don't do meetings.\n\n15:07.880 --> 15:09.880\n All other academics are jealous of you, by the way.\n\n15:09.880 --> 15:11.560\n Yeah. I know.\n\n15:11.560 --> 15:13.480\n No Zoom meetings.\n\n15:13.480 --> 15:15.360\n I find those are,\n\n15:15.360 --> 15:19.880\n that's one of the worst tragedies of the pandemic,\n\n15:19.880 --> 15:21.880\n is both the opportunity to,\n\n15:21.880 --> 15:25.760\n the positive thing is to have more time with your family,\n\n15:25.760 --> 15:27.320\n sort of reconnect in many ways.\n\n15:27.320 --> 15:28.960\n And that's really interesting.\n\n15:29.880 --> 15:34.120\n Be able to remotely sort of not waste time on travel\n\n15:34.120 --> 15:35.200\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n15:35.200 --> 15:38.440\n The negative is, actually both those things\n\n15:38.440 --> 15:40.400\n are also sourced from the negative.\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:41.760\n But the negative is like,\n\n15:41.760 --> 15:44.280\n it seems like people have multiplied the number of meetings\n\n15:44.280 --> 15:46.240\n because they're so easy to schedule.\n\n15:46.240 --> 15:50.920\n And there's nothing more draining to me intellectually,\n\n15:50.920 --> 15:55.600\n philosophically, just my spirit is destroyed\n\n15:55.600 --> 15:57.880\n by even a 10 minute Zoom meeting.\n\n15:57.880 --> 15:59.760\n Like, what are we doing here?\n\n15:59.760 --> 16:01.760\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n16:01.760 --> 16:04.000\n Yeah, I have, every Zoom meeting is,\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.720\n I have an existential crisis, so.\n\n16:05.720 --> 16:08.200\n Kierkegaard with the internet connection.\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:13.200\n So, what the hell are we talking about?\n\n16:13.760 --> 16:16.680\n Oh, so when you don't have meetings,\n\n16:16.680 --> 16:21.520\n there's a luxury to really allow for certain things\n\n16:21.520 --> 16:25.040\n if they need to, like the important things,\n\n16:25.040 --> 16:27.960\n like deep work sessions to last way longer\n\n16:27.960 --> 16:30.800\n than you maybe planned for.\n\n16:30.800 --> 16:33.280\n I mean, that's my goal is to try to schedule,\n\n16:33.280 --> 16:34.560\n the goal is to schedule,\n\n16:34.560 --> 16:37.440\n to sit and focus for a particular task for an hour\n\n16:37.440 --> 16:41.920\n and hope I can keep going and hope I can get lost in it.\n\n16:41.920 --> 16:46.920\n And do you find that this is at all an okay way to go\n\n16:48.240 --> 16:51.800\n and the time blocking is just something you have to do\n\n16:51.800 --> 16:54.880\n to actually be an adult and operate in this real world?\n\n16:54.880 --> 16:57.960\n Or is there some magic to the time blocking?\n\n16:57.960 --> 17:00.480\n Well, I mean, there's magic to the intention.\n\n17:01.360 --> 17:05.000\n There's magic to it if you have varied responsibilities.\n\n17:05.000 --> 17:08.760\n So I'm often juggling multiple jobs, essentially.\n\n17:08.760 --> 17:11.120\n There's academic stuff, there's teaching stuff,\n\n17:11.120 --> 17:13.520\n there's book stuff, there's the business\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:16.520\n surrounding my book stuff.\n\n17:16.520 --> 17:18.960\n But I'm of your same mindset.\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:22.200\n If a deep work session is going well,\n\n17:22.200 --> 17:24.480\n you just rock and roll and let it go on.\n\n17:24.480 --> 17:26.360\n So like one of the big keys of time block,\n\n17:26.360 --> 17:27.240\n at least the way I do it,\n\n17:27.240 --> 17:30.640\n so I even sell this planner to help people time block,\n\n17:30.640 --> 17:32.920\n it has many columns because the discipline is,\n\n17:32.920 --> 17:35.920\n oh, if your initial schedule changes,\n\n17:35.920 --> 17:36.840\n you just move over one.\n\n17:36.840 --> 17:38.920\n Next time you get a chance, you move over one column\n\n17:38.920 --> 17:41.240\n and then you just fix it for the time that's remaining.\n\n17:41.240 --> 17:43.080\n So in other words, there's no bonus\n\n17:43.080 --> 17:46.280\n for I made a schedule and I stuck with it.\n\n17:46.280 --> 17:47.120\n Like there's actually,\n\n17:47.120 --> 17:48.600\n it's not like you get a prize for it, right?\n\n17:48.600 --> 17:51.840\n Like for me, the prize is I have an intentional plan\n\n17:51.840 --> 17:54.640\n for my time and if I have to change that plan, that's fine.\n\n17:54.640 --> 17:56.280\n Like the state I wanna be is basically\n\n17:56.280 --> 17:57.840\n at any point in the day, I've thought about\n\n17:57.840 --> 18:00.600\n what time remains and gave it some thought\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:02.080\n for what to do because I'll do the same thing,\n\n18:02.080 --> 18:04.640\n even though I have a lot more meetings\n\n18:04.640 --> 18:06.920\n and other types of things I have to do in my various jobs\n\n18:06.920 --> 18:09.680\n and I basically prioritize the deep work\n\n18:09.680 --> 18:11.080\n and they get yelled at a lot.\n\n18:11.080 --> 18:12.760\n So that's kind of my strategy is like,\n\n18:12.760 --> 18:15.560\n just be okay, just be okay getting yelled at a lot\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:18.120\n because I feel you, if you're rolling, yeah.\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:20.200\n Well, that's what it is for me, like with writing,\n\n18:20.200 --> 18:22.120\n I think it's writing so hard in a certain way\n\n18:22.120 --> 18:24.880\n that it's, you don't really get on a roll in some sense,\n\n18:24.880 --> 18:28.400\n like it's just difficult, but working on proofs,\n\n18:28.400 --> 18:32.320\n it's very hard to pull yourself away from a proof\n\n18:32.320 --> 18:33.880\n if you start to get some traction,\n\n18:33.880 --> 18:35.480\n just you've been at it for a couple of hours\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:37.760\n and you feel the pins and tumblers\n\n18:37.760 --> 18:40.480\n starting to click together and progress is being made,\n\n18:40.480 --> 18:42.360\n it's really hard to pull away from that.\n\n18:42.360 --> 18:45.160\n So I'm willing to get yelled at by almost everyone.\n\n18:45.160 --> 18:48.520\n Of course, there is also a positive effect\n\n18:48.520 --> 18:53.160\n to pulling yourself out of it when things are going great\n\n18:53.160 --> 18:55.640\n because then you're kind of excited to resume.\n\n18:55.640 --> 18:56.480\n Yeah.\n\n18:56.480 --> 18:58.600\n Like stopping on a dead end.\n\n18:58.600 --> 18:59.440\n That's true.\n\n19:03.440 --> 19:05.440\n There's an extra force of procrastination\n\n19:05.440 --> 19:07.560\n that comes with if you stop on a dead end\n\n19:07.560 --> 19:08.920\n to return to the task.\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:10.840\n Yeah, or a cold start.\n\n19:10.840 --> 19:11.680\n Yeah.\n\n19:11.680 --> 19:13.280\n Whenever I feel like I'm in a stage now,\n\n19:13.280 --> 19:15.400\n I submitted a few papers recently.\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:18.600\n So now we're sort of starting something up from cold\n\n19:18.600 --> 19:20.520\n and it takes way too long to get going\n\n19:20.520 --> 19:23.720\n because it's very hard to get the motivation\n\n19:23.720 --> 19:25.840\n to schedule a time when it's not, yeah, we're in it.\n\n19:25.840 --> 19:26.840\n Like here's where we are.\n\n19:26.840 --> 19:28.280\n We feel like something's about to give here.\n\n19:28.280 --> 19:30.600\n We need the very early stages where it's just,\n\n19:30.600 --> 19:32.840\n I don't know, I'm gonna read hard papers\n\n19:32.840 --> 19:34.080\n and it's gonna be hard to understand them\n\n19:34.080 --> 19:35.600\n and I'm gonna have no idea how to make progress.\n\n19:35.600 --> 19:38.440\n It's not motivating.\n\n19:38.440 --> 19:39.680\n What about deadlines?\n\n19:39.680 --> 19:42.720\n Can we, okay, so this is like a therapy session.\n\n19:46.200 --> 19:50.120\n It seems like I only get stuff done that has deadlines.\n\n19:50.120 --> 19:53.200\n And so one of the implied powerful things\n\n19:53.200 --> 19:56.120\n about time blocking is there's a kind of deadline\n\n19:56.120 --> 19:59.880\n or there's a artificial or real sense of urgency.\n\n19:59.880 --> 20:02.760\n Do you think it's possible to get anything done\n\n20:02.760 --> 20:04.200\n in this world without deadlines?\n\n20:04.200 --> 20:06.120\n Why do deadlines work so well?\n\n20:06.120 --> 20:08.440\n Well, I mean, it's a clear motivational signal,\n\n20:08.440 --> 20:12.040\n but in the short term, you do get an effect like that\n\n20:12.040 --> 20:12.880\n in time blocking.\n\n20:12.880 --> 20:15.440\n I think the strong effect you get by saying,\n\n20:15.440 --> 20:18.120\n this is the exact time I'm gonna work on this,\n\n20:18.120 --> 20:20.000\n is that you don't have the debate with yourself\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:23.600\n every three minutes about, should I take a break now?\n\n20:23.600 --> 20:25.000\n This is the big issue with just saying,\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:26.280\n I'm gonna go write.\n\n20:26.280 --> 20:27.760\n I'm gonna write for a while and that's it\n\n20:27.760 --> 20:28.680\n because your mind is saying,\n\n20:28.680 --> 20:30.920\n well, obviously we're gonna take some breaks.\n\n20:30.920 --> 20:32.360\n We're not just gonna write forever.\n\n20:32.360 --> 20:34.200\n And so why not right now?\n\n20:34.200 --> 20:35.160\n You have to be like, well, not right now.\n\n20:35.160 --> 20:36.320\n Let's go a little bit longer, five minutes.\n\n20:36.320 --> 20:37.400\n So why don't we just take a break now?\n\n20:37.400 --> 20:38.800\n We should probably look at the internet.\n\n20:38.800 --> 20:40.240\n Now you have to constantly have this battle.\n\n20:40.240 --> 20:42.440\n On the other hand, if you're in a time block schedule,\n\n20:42.440 --> 20:44.280\n I've got these two hours put aside for writing.\n\n20:44.280 --> 20:46.000\n That's what I'm supposed to be doing.\n\n20:46.000 --> 20:48.280\n I have a break scheduled over here.\n\n20:48.280 --> 20:50.040\n I don't have to fight with myself, right?\n\n20:50.040 --> 20:51.280\n And maybe at a larger scale,\n\n20:51.280 --> 20:53.720\n deadlines give you a similar sort of effect.\n\n20:53.720 --> 20:55.320\n I know this is what I'm supposed to be working on\n\n20:55.320 --> 20:57.960\n because it's due.\n\n20:57.960 --> 21:01.200\n Perhaps, but will you describe it as much healthier\n\n21:01.200 --> 21:02.880\n sort of giving yourself over,\n\n21:02.880 --> 21:05.640\n and you talk about this in the new email book,\n\n21:05.640 --> 21:07.160\n the process, I mean, in general,\n\n21:07.160 --> 21:09.800\n you talk about it all over, is creating a process\n\n21:09.800 --> 21:13.440\n and then giving yourself over to the process.\n\n21:15.200 --> 21:17.600\n But then you have to be strict with yourself.\n\n21:17.600 --> 21:19.640\n Yeah, but what are the deadlines you're talking about?\n\n21:19.640 --> 21:20.600\n It's like with papers,\n\n21:20.600 --> 21:22.760\n like what's the main type of deadline work?\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:26.240\n Well, so papers, definitely,\n\n21:26.240 --> 21:31.360\n but publications, like say this podcast,\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:35.240\n I have to publish this podcast early next week,\n\n21:35.240 --> 21:36.680\n one, because your book is coming out.\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:40.040\n I'd love to sort of support this amazing book,\n\n21:40.040 --> 21:45.040\n but the other is I have to fly to Vegas on Thursday\n\n21:45.040 --> 21:47.840\n to run 40 miles with David Goggins.\n\n21:47.840 --> 21:50.920\n And so I want this podcast,\n\n21:50.920 --> 21:54.360\n this conversation we're doing now to be out of my life.\n\n21:54.360 --> 21:56.720\n Like I don't wanna be in a hotel in Vegas,\n\n21:56.720 --> 22:00.240\n like freaking out while David Goggins is yelling.\n\n22:00.240 --> 22:05.240\n On hour 43 of your Tarathon thing.\n\n22:05.240 --> 22:08.640\n But actually it's possible that I still will be doing that\n\n22:08.640 --> 22:11.440\n because that's not a hard, that's a softer deadline, right?\n\n22:11.440 --> 22:12.560\n But those are sort of,\n\n22:12.560 --> 22:15.240\n life imposes these kinds of deadlines.\n\n22:15.240 --> 22:16.080\n Yeah.\n\n22:16.080 --> 22:17.200\n I'm not, so yeah,\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:19.960\n papers are nice because there's an actual deadline.\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:20.800\n Yeah.\n\n22:20.800 --> 22:24.440\n But I am almost referring to like the pressure\n\n22:24.440 --> 22:25.960\n that people put on you.\n\n22:25.960 --> 22:28.720\n Hey man, you said you're gonna get this done two months ago.\n\n22:28.720 --> 22:30.040\n Why haven't you gotten it done?\n\n22:30.040 --> 22:31.640\n I don't see, I don't like that pressure.\n\n22:31.640 --> 22:32.480\n Yeah.\n\n22:32.480 --> 22:33.320\n First of all, I think we can all.\n\n22:33.320 --> 22:34.240\n I hate it too.\n\n22:34.240 --> 22:37.160\n We can agree, by the way, having David Goggins yell at you\n\n22:37.160 --> 22:39.400\n is probably the top productivity technique.\n\n22:39.400 --> 22:42.480\n I think we'd all get a lot more done\n\n22:42.480 --> 22:45.080\n if he was yelling, but see, I don't like that.\n\n22:45.080 --> 22:47.520\n So I will try to get things done early.\n\n22:47.520 --> 22:49.040\n I like having flex.\n\n22:49.040 --> 22:52.960\n I also don't like the idea of this has to get done today.\n\n22:52.960 --> 22:53.800\n Right?\n\n22:53.800 --> 22:56.440\n Like it's due at midnight and we've got a lot to do\n\n22:56.440 --> 22:57.280\n as the night before,\n\n22:57.280 --> 22:59.760\n because then I get in my head about what if I get sick?\n\n22:59.760 --> 23:01.360\n Or like, what if, you know,\n\n23:01.360 --> 23:03.200\n what if I don't get a bad night's sleep\n\n23:03.200 --> 23:04.760\n and I can't think clearly?\n\n23:04.760 --> 23:05.680\n So I like to have the flex.\n\n23:05.680 --> 23:07.440\n So I'm all process.\n\n23:07.440 --> 23:08.920\n And that's like the philosophical aspect\n\n23:08.920 --> 23:09.760\n of that book, Deep Work,\n\n23:09.760 --> 23:13.040\n is that there's something very human and deep\n\n23:13.040 --> 23:15.080\n about just wrangling with the world of ideas.\n\n23:15.080 --> 23:16.480\n I mean, Aristotle talked about this.\n\n23:16.480 --> 23:18.320\n If you go back and read the ethics,\n\n23:18.320 --> 23:20.280\n he's trying to understand the meaning of life\n\n23:20.280 --> 23:22.120\n and he eventually ends up ultimately\n\n23:22.120 --> 23:26.400\n at the human capacity to contemplate deeply.\n\n23:26.400 --> 23:27.920\n It's kind of like a teleological argument.\n\n23:27.920 --> 23:29.480\n It's the things that only humans can do\n\n23:29.480 --> 23:31.680\n and therefore it must be somehow connected to our ends.\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:34.240\n And he said, ultimately that's where he found his meaning,\n\n23:34.240 --> 23:36.480\n but, you know, he's touching on some sort of intimation\n\n23:36.480 --> 23:37.760\n there that's correct.\n\n23:37.760 --> 23:39.600\n And so what I try to build my life around\n\n23:39.600 --> 23:44.360\n is regularly thinking hard about stuff that's interesting.\n\n23:44.360 --> 23:46.360\n Just like if you get a fitness habit going,\n\n23:46.360 --> 23:50.200\n you feel off when you don't do it.\n\n23:50.200 --> 23:51.600\n I try to get that cognitive habit.\n\n23:51.600 --> 23:52.880\n So it's like, I got it.\n\n23:52.880 --> 23:54.280\n I mean, look, I have my bag here somewhere,\n\n23:54.280 --> 23:56.720\n I have my notebook in it because I was thinking\n\n23:56.720 --> 23:58.240\n on the Uber ride over, I was like, you know,\n\n23:58.240 --> 24:00.400\n I could get some, I'm working on this new proof\n\n24:00.400 --> 24:02.680\n and it just, so you train yourself.\n\n24:02.680 --> 24:04.680\n You train yourself to appreciate certain things.\n\n24:04.680 --> 24:08.040\n And then over time, the hope is that it accretes.\n\n24:08.040 --> 24:09.720\n Well, let's talk about some demons\n\n24:09.720 --> 24:13.760\n because I wonder there's like deep work,\n\n24:13.760 --> 24:18.760\n which and the world without email books\n\n24:19.200 --> 24:23.280\n that to me symbolize the life I want to live.\n\n24:23.280 --> 24:24.120\n Okay.\n\n24:24.120 --> 24:26.320\n And then there is, I'm like,\n\n24:26.320 --> 24:29.800\n despite appearances and adult at this point,\n\n24:29.800 --> 24:32.080\n and this is the life I actually live.\n\n24:33.200 --> 24:36.160\n And I'm in constant chaos.\n\n24:36.160 --> 24:37.720\n You said you don't like that anxiety.\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:38.760\n I hate it too.\n\n24:38.760 --> 24:41.240\n But it seems like I'm always in it.\n\n24:41.240 --> 24:42.920\n It's a giant mess.\n\n24:42.920 --> 24:46.520\n It's like, it's almost like whenever I establish,\n\n24:46.520 --> 24:49.280\n whenever I have successful processes for doing deep work,\n\n24:49.280 --> 24:52.000\n I'll add stuff on top of it just to introduce the chaos.\n\n24:52.000 --> 24:52.840\n Yeah.\n\n24:52.840 --> 24:54.080\n And like, I don't want to.\n\n24:54.080 --> 24:54.920\n Yeah.\n\n24:54.920 --> 24:57.480\n But you have to look in the mirror at a certain point\n\n24:57.480 --> 25:00.560\n and you have to say like, who the hell am I?\n\n25:00.560 --> 25:02.400\n Like, I keep doing this.\n\n25:02.400 --> 25:04.640\n Is this something that's fundamental to who I am\n\n25:04.640 --> 25:06.120\n or do I really need to fix this?\n\n25:06.120 --> 25:07.480\n What's the chaos right now?\n\n25:07.480 --> 25:09.840\n Like, I've seen your video about like your routine.\n\n25:09.840 --> 25:12.320\n It seemed very structured and deep.\n\n25:12.320 --> 25:13.640\n In fact, I was really envious of it.\n\n25:13.640 --> 25:17.040\n So like, what's the chaos now that's not in that video?\n\n25:17.040 --> 25:19.080\n Many of those sessions go way longer.\n\n25:19.080 --> 25:20.440\n I don't get enough sleep.\n\n25:20.440 --> 25:21.280\n Yeah.\n\n25:21.280 --> 25:24.080\n And then I, the main introduction of chaos is,\n\n25:24.080 --> 25:26.600\n it's taking on too many things on the to do list.\n\n25:26.600 --> 25:27.800\n I see.\n\n25:27.800 --> 25:29.440\n It's, I mean, I suppose it's a problem\n\n25:29.440 --> 25:30.880\n that everybody deals with,\n\n25:30.880 --> 25:33.400\n which is saying, not saying no.\n\n25:33.400 --> 25:36.880\n But it's not like I have trouble saying no.\n\n25:36.880 --> 25:39.040\n It's that there's so much cool shit in my life.\n\n25:39.040 --> 25:39.880\n Yeah.\n\n25:39.880 --> 25:42.720\n Okay, listen, there's nothing I love more in this world\n\n25:42.720 --> 25:45.320\n than the Boston Dynamics robots.\n\n25:45.320 --> 25:46.960\n Spot and the other, yeah.\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:48.360\n And they're giving me spot.\n\n25:48.360 --> 25:50.320\n So there's a to do, what am I gonna say?\n\n25:50.320 --> 25:51.160\n No.\n\n25:51.160 --> 25:52.000\n Yeah.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:52.840\n So they're getting me spot\n\n25:52.840 --> 25:54.320\n and I wanna do some computer vision stuff\n\n25:54.320 --> 25:55.480\n for the hell of it.\n\n25:55.480 --> 25:57.520\n Okay, so that's now a to do item.\n\n25:57.520 --> 25:59.000\n And then you go to Texas for a while.\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:00.040\n There's Texas.\n\n26:00.040 --> 26:00.880\n Everything's happening.\n\n26:00.880 --> 26:02.400\n There's all the interesting people down there.\n\n26:02.400 --> 26:03.920\n And then there's surprises, right?\n\n26:03.920 --> 26:05.800\n There are power outages in Texas.\n\n26:05.800 --> 26:07.360\n There's constant changes to plans\n\n26:07.360 --> 26:08.480\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:09.880\n And you sleep less.\n\n26:09.880 --> 26:11.400\n And then there's personal stuff,\n\n26:11.400 --> 26:14.640\n like just people in your life, sources of stress,\n\n26:14.640 --> 26:16.520\n all those kinds of things.\n\n26:16.520 --> 26:19.960\n But it does feel like if I'm just being introspective,\n\n26:19.960 --> 26:22.400\n that I bring it onto myself.\n\n26:22.400 --> 26:24.480\n I suppose a lot of people do this kind of thing.\n\n26:24.480 --> 26:25.680\n Yeah.\n\n26:25.680 --> 26:29.720\n Is they flourish under pressure.\n\n26:29.720 --> 26:30.560\n Yeah.\n\n26:30.560 --> 26:34.920\n And I wonder if that's just a hack I've developed\n\n26:34.920 --> 26:37.600\n as a habit early on in life\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:42.080\n that you need to let go of, you need to fix.\n\n26:42.080 --> 26:44.000\n But it's all interesting things.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:44.840\n Yeah.\n\n26:44.840 --> 26:45.680\n That's interesting.\n\n26:45.680 --> 26:47.520\n Yeah, because these are all interesting things.\n\n26:47.520 --> 26:49.720\n Well, one of the things you talked about in Deep Work,\n\n26:49.720 --> 26:53.480\n which is really important, is having an end to the day.\n\n26:53.480 --> 26:54.320\n Yeah.\n\n26:54.320 --> 26:55.160\n Like putting it down.\n\n26:55.160 --> 26:56.000\n Yeah.\n\n26:56.000 --> 26:59.040\n Like that, I don't think I've ever done that in my life.\n\n26:59.040 --> 26:59.880\n Yeah.\n\n26:59.880 --> 27:01.000\n Well, see, I started doing that early\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:04.040\n because I got married early.\n\n27:04.040 --> 27:05.280\n So I didn't have a real job.\n\n27:05.280 --> 27:07.680\n I was a grad student, but my wife had a real job.\n\n27:07.680 --> 27:10.840\n And so I just figured I should do my work\n\n27:10.840 --> 27:12.160\n when she's at work.\n\n27:12.160 --> 27:14.440\n Because hey, when work's over, she'll be home,\n\n27:14.440 --> 27:17.720\n and I don't wanna be on campus or whatever.\n\n27:17.720 --> 27:19.680\n And so real early on, I just got in that habit\n\n27:19.680 --> 27:22.280\n of this is when you end work.\n\n27:22.280 --> 27:24.000\n And then when I was a postdoc,\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:26.400\n which is kind of an easy job, right?\n\n27:26.400 --> 27:29.960\n I put artificial, I was like, I wanna train.\n\n27:29.960 --> 27:31.560\n I was like, when I'm a professor, it's gonna be busier\n\n27:31.560 --> 27:34.200\n because there's demands that professors have beyond research.\n\n27:34.200 --> 27:35.560\n And so as a postdoc,\n\n27:35.560 --> 27:37.960\n I added artificial large time consuming things\n\n27:37.960 --> 27:38.800\n into the middle of my day.\n\n27:38.800 --> 27:41.200\n I basically exercise for two hours in the middle of the day\n\n27:41.200 --> 27:44.560\n and do all this productive meditation and stuff like this,\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:46.720\n while still maintaining the nine to five.\n\n27:46.720 --> 27:48.680\n So it's like, okay, I wanna get really good\n\n27:48.680 --> 27:51.600\n at putting artificial constraints on so that I stay,\n\n27:51.600 --> 27:54.720\n I didn't wanna get flabby when my job was easy.\n\n27:54.720 --> 27:56.600\n So that when I became a professor,\n\n27:56.600 --> 27:57.800\n and now all of that's paying off\n\n27:57.800 --> 27:59.280\n because I have a ton of kids.\n\n27:59.280 --> 28:01.880\n So now I don't really have a choice.\n\n28:01.880 --> 28:04.080\n That's what's probably keeping me away from cool things\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:06.200\n is I just don't have time to do them.\n\n28:06.200 --> 28:09.960\n And then after a while people stop bothering.\n\n28:09.960 --> 28:13.000\n Well, but that's how you have a successful life.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:14.440\n Otherwise you're going to,\n\n28:14.440 --> 28:17.960\n it's too easy to then go into the full Hunter S. Thompson.\n\n28:17.960 --> 28:22.040\n Like to where nobody wants,\n\n28:22.040 --> 28:25.680\n nobody functional wants to be in your vicinity.\n\n28:25.680 --> 28:29.200\n Like you're driving, you attract the people\n\n28:29.200 --> 28:33.360\n that have a similar behavior pattern as you.\n\n28:33.360 --> 28:35.400\n So if you live in chaos,\n\n28:35.400 --> 28:37.360\n you're going to attract chaotic people.\n\n28:37.360 --> 28:42.040\n And then it becomes like this self fulfilling prophecy.\n\n28:42.040 --> 28:45.920\n And it feels like I'm not bothered by it,\n\n28:45.920 --> 28:48.400\n but I guess this is all coming around\n\n28:48.400 --> 28:50.880\n to exactly what you're saying, which is like,\n\n28:50.880 --> 28:53.120\n I think one of the big hacks for productive people\n\n28:53.120 --> 28:57.560\n that I've met is to get married and have kids, honestly.\n\n28:57.560 --> 29:00.800\n It's very perhaps counterintuitive,\n\n29:00.800 --> 29:05.600\n but it gets, it's like the ultimate timetable enforcer.\n\n29:05.600 --> 29:08.800\n Yeah, it enforces a lot of timetables,\n\n29:08.800 --> 29:10.200\n though it has a huge,\n\n29:10.200 --> 29:13.280\n kids have a huge productivity hit those, you gotta weigh it.\n\n29:13.280 --> 29:15.400\n But okay, here's the complicated thing though.\n\n29:15.400 --> 29:17.080\n Like you could think about in your own life,\n\n29:17.080 --> 29:18.520\n starting the podcast as one of these\n\n29:18.520 --> 29:22.040\n just cool opportunities that you put on yourself, right?\n\n29:22.040 --> 29:25.000\n Like I could have been talking to you at MIT four years ago\n\n29:25.000 --> 29:25.840\n and be like, don't do that.\n\n29:25.840 --> 29:28.080\n Like your research is going well, right?\n\n29:28.080 --> 29:29.320\n But then everyone who watches you is like,\n\n29:29.320 --> 29:30.480\n okay, this podcast is,\n\n29:30.480 --> 29:31.680\n the direction that's taking you\n\n29:31.680 --> 29:33.640\n is like a couple of years from now,\n\n29:33.640 --> 29:36.560\n it's gonna, it'll be something really monumental\n\n29:36.560 --> 29:38.040\n that you're probably, that's gonna probably lead to, right?\n\n29:38.040 --> 29:39.880\n There'll be some really,\n\n29:39.880 --> 29:41.760\n it just feels like your life is going somewhere.\n\n29:41.760 --> 29:42.600\n It's going somewhere.\n\n29:42.600 --> 29:43.600\n It's interesting.\n\n29:43.600 --> 29:44.560\n Unexpected, yeah.\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:46.320\n Yeah, so how do you balance those two things?\n\n29:46.320 --> 29:47.840\n And so what I try to throw at it\n\n29:47.840 --> 29:50.880\n is this motto of do less, do better, know why, right?\n\n29:50.880 --> 29:55.560\n So do less, do better, know why.\n\n29:55.560 --> 29:58.720\n It used to be the motto of my website years ago.\n\n29:58.720 --> 30:01.880\n So do a few things, but like an interesting array, right?\n\n30:01.880 --> 30:06.840\n So I was doing MIT stuff, but I was also writing, you know?\n\n30:06.840 --> 30:08.440\n So a couple of things are, you know, they were interesting.\n\n30:08.440 --> 30:10.200\n Like I have a couple bets placed\n\n30:10.200 --> 30:12.760\n on a couple of different numbers on the roulette table,\n\n30:12.760 --> 30:14.080\n but not too many things.\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:15.840\n And then really try to do those things really well\n\n30:15.840 --> 30:16.800\n and see where it goes.\n\n30:16.800 --> 30:17.640\n Like with my writing,\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:19.520\n I just spent years and years and years just training.\n\n30:19.520 --> 30:20.360\n I was like, I wanna be a better writer,\n\n30:20.360 --> 30:21.200\n I wanna be a better writer.\n\n30:21.200 --> 30:24.160\n I started writing student books when I was a student.\n\n30:24.160 --> 30:25.920\n I really wanted to write hardcover idea books.\n\n30:25.920 --> 30:26.760\n I started training.\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:30.280\n I would use like New Yorker articles to train myself.\n\n30:30.280 --> 30:31.960\n I'd break them down and then I'd get commissions\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:34.320\n with much smaller magazines and practice the skills.\n\n30:34.320 --> 30:37.000\n And it took forever until, you know, but now today,\n\n30:37.000 --> 30:38.320\n like I actually get to write for the New Yorker,\n\n30:38.320 --> 30:40.280\n but it took like a decade.\n\n30:40.280 --> 30:42.080\n So a small number of things, try to do them really well.\n\n30:42.080 --> 30:44.040\n And then the know why is have a connection\n\n30:44.040 --> 30:45.760\n to some sort of value.\n\n30:45.760 --> 30:48.880\n Like in general, I think this is worth doing\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:50.600\n and then seeing where it leads.\n\n30:50.600 --> 30:55.280\n And so the choice of the few things is grounded in what?\n\n30:55.280 --> 31:00.240\n Like a little flame of passion, like a love for the thing,\n\n31:00.240 --> 31:02.560\n like a sense that you say you wanted to write,\n\n31:02.560 --> 31:04.200\n get good at writing.\n\n31:04.200 --> 31:07.780\n You had that kind of introspective moment of thinking,\n\n31:07.780 --> 31:10.320\n this actually brings me a lot of joy and fulfillment.\n\n31:10.320 --> 31:11.560\n Yeah, I mean, it gets complicated\n\n31:11.560 --> 31:12.400\n because I wrote a whole book\n\n31:12.400 --> 31:14.640\n about following your passion being bad advice,\n\n31:14.640 --> 31:18.400\n which is like the first thing I kind of got infamous for.\n\n31:18.400 --> 31:20.080\n I wrote that back in 2012.\n\n31:20.080 --> 31:23.280\n But the argument there is like passion cultivates, right?\n\n31:23.280 --> 31:26.120\n So what I was pushing back on was the myth\n\n31:26.120 --> 31:29.880\n that the passion for what you do exists full intensity\n\n31:29.880 --> 31:32.620\n before you start, and then that's what propels you.\n\n31:32.620 --> 31:35.400\n Or actually the reality is as you get better at something,\n\n31:35.400 --> 31:37.280\n as you gain more autonomy, more skill and more impact,\n\n31:37.280 --> 31:38.600\n the passion grows along with it.\n\n31:38.600 --> 31:42.060\n So that when people look back later and say,\n\n31:42.060 --> 31:43.760\n oh, follow your passion, what they really mean is\n\n31:43.760 --> 31:45.200\n I'm very passionate about what I do,\n\n31:45.200 --> 31:47.080\n and that's a worthy goal.\n\n31:47.080 --> 31:49.320\n But how you actually cultivate that is much more complicated\n\n31:49.320 --> 31:51.960\n than just introspection is gonna identify,\n\n31:51.960 --> 31:54.060\n like for sure you should be a writer or something like this.\n\n31:54.060 --> 31:55.280\n So I was actually quoting you.\n\n31:55.280 --> 32:00.280\n I was on a social network last night in a clubhouse.\n\n32:00.400 --> 32:01.720\n I don't know if you've heard of it.\n\n32:01.720 --> 32:03.280\n Wait, I have to ask you about this\n\n32:03.280 --> 32:05.560\n because I'm invited to do a clubhouse.\n\n32:05.560 --> 32:07.160\n I don't know what that means.\n\n32:07.160 --> 32:09.300\n A tech reporter has invited me to do a clubhouse\n\n32:09.300 --> 32:10.200\n about my new book.\n\n32:11.200 --> 32:12.560\n That's awesome.\n\n32:12.560 --> 32:14.200\n Well, let me know when, because I'll show up.\n\n32:14.200 --> 32:15.080\n But what is it?\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:16.680\n Okay, so first of all, let me just mention\n\n32:16.680 --> 32:21.120\n that I was in a clubhouse room last night,\n\n32:21.120 --> 32:24.760\n and I kept plugging exactly what you said about passion.\n\n32:24.760 --> 32:25.800\n So we'll talk about it.\n\n32:25.800 --> 32:28.360\n It was a room that was focused on burnout.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:29.520\n Okay.\n\n32:29.520 --> 32:34.200\n But first, clubhouse is a kind of fascinating place\n\n32:34.200 --> 32:37.680\n in terms of your mind would be very interesting\n\n32:37.680 --> 32:41.640\n to analyze this place because we talk about email,\n\n32:41.640 --> 32:43.560\n talk about social networks,\n\n32:43.560 --> 32:45.400\n but clubhouse is something very different.\n\n32:45.400 --> 32:47.280\n And I've encountered it in other places,\n\n32:47.280 --> 32:52.280\n Discord and so on, that's voice only communication.\n\n32:52.320 --> 32:53.740\n So it's a bunch of people in a room.\n\n32:53.740 --> 32:56.240\n They're just, their eyes closed.\n\n32:56.240 --> 32:57.640\n All you hear is their voices.\n\n32:57.640 --> 32:58.520\n In real time.\n\n32:58.520 --> 32:59.840\n Real time, live.\n\n32:59.840 --> 33:01.060\n It only happens live.\n\n33:01.060 --> 33:03.240\n You're technically not allowed to record,\n\n33:03.240 --> 33:04.680\n but some people still do,\n\n33:04.680 --> 33:07.740\n and especially when it's big conversations.\n\n33:07.740 --> 33:09.840\n But the whole point is it's there live.\n\n33:09.840 --> 33:10.960\n And there's different structures.\n\n33:10.960 --> 33:13.920\n Like on Discord, it was so fascinating.\n\n33:13.920 --> 33:15.960\n I have this Discord server\n\n33:15.960 --> 33:19.480\n that would have hundreds of people in a room together, right?\n\n33:19.480 --> 33:22.880\n We're all just little icons that can mute and unmute our mics.\n\n33:22.880 --> 33:23.720\n Okay.\n\n33:23.720 --> 33:28.240\n And so you're sitting there, so it's just voices,\n\n33:28.240 --> 33:31.280\n and you're able with hundreds of people\n\n33:31.280 --> 33:33.960\n to not interrupt each other.\n\n33:33.960 --> 33:37.400\n Well, first of all, like as a dynamic system, like.\n\n33:37.400 --> 33:40.160\n You see icons just like mics muted or not muted basically.\n\n33:40.160 --> 33:42.360\n Yeah, well, so everyone's muted and they unmute\n\n33:42.360 --> 33:44.120\n and it starts flashing.\n\n33:44.120 --> 33:44.960\n Yeah.\n\n33:44.960 --> 33:47.940\n Oh, so you're like, okay, let me get precedence.\n\n33:47.940 --> 33:48.780\n Yeah.\n\n33:48.780 --> 33:49.600\n So it's the digital equivalent\n\n33:49.600 --> 33:52.320\n of when you're in a conversation, like at a faculty meeting,\n\n33:52.320 --> 33:54.840\n and you sort of like kind of make some noises,\n\n33:54.840 --> 33:56.200\n like while the other person's finishing.\n\n33:56.200 --> 33:57.800\n And so people realize like, okay,\n\n33:57.800 --> 33:58.880\n this person wants to talk next,\n\n33:58.880 --> 34:00.200\n but now it's purely digital.\n\n34:00.200 --> 34:01.480\n You see a flashing.\n\n34:01.480 --> 34:04.280\n But in a faculty meeting, which is very interesting,\n\n34:04.280 --> 34:06.540\n like even as we're talking now,\n\n34:06.540 --> 34:09.600\n there's a visual element that seems to increase\n\n34:09.600 --> 34:11.320\n the probability of interruption.\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:12.160\n Yeah.\n\n34:12.160 --> 34:13.680\n It's just darkness.\n\n34:13.680 --> 34:17.280\n You actually listen better and you don't interrupt.\n\n34:17.280 --> 34:18.720\n So like if you create a culture,\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:20.840\n there's always gonna be assholes,\n\n34:20.840 --> 34:23.320\n but they're actually exceptions.\n\n34:23.320 --> 34:24.640\n Everybody adjusts.\n\n34:24.640 --> 34:28.240\n They kind of evolve to the beat of the room.\n\n34:28.240 --> 34:30.280\n Okay, that's one fascinating aspect.\n\n34:30.280 --> 34:32.200\n It's like, okay, that's weird.\n\n34:32.200 --> 34:34.360\n Cause it's different than like a Zoom call\n\n34:34.360 --> 34:35.520\n where there's video.\n\n34:35.520 --> 34:36.760\n Yeah.\n\n34:36.760 --> 34:38.520\n It's just audio.\n\n34:38.520 --> 34:42.680\n You think video adds, but actually seems like it subtracts.\n\n34:42.680 --> 34:45.160\n The second aspect of it that's fascinating\n\n34:45.160 --> 34:49.920\n is when it's no video, just audio, there's an intimacy.\n\n34:49.920 --> 34:51.640\n It's weird.\n\n34:51.640 --> 34:56.640\n Because with strangers, you connect in a much more real way.\n\n34:57.160 --> 34:58.960\n It's similar to podcasts.\n\n34:58.960 --> 34:59.800\n Yeah.\n\n34:59.800 --> 35:01.600\n But with a lot of people.\n\n35:01.600 --> 35:03.880\n With a lot of people and new people.\n\n35:03.880 --> 35:07.520\n And they bring, okay, first of all,\n\n35:07.520 --> 35:10.840\n different voices, like low voices and like high voices.\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:14.320\n And it's more difficult to judge.\n\n35:14.320 --> 35:18.520\n In Discord, you couldn't even see the people.\n\n35:18.520 --> 35:21.600\n It was a culture where you do funny profile pictures\n\n35:21.600 --> 35:23.120\n as opposed to your actual face.\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:24.920\n In clubhouse, it's your actual face.\n\n35:24.920 --> 35:27.600\n So you can tell like as an older person, younger person.\n\n35:27.600 --> 35:28.800\n In Discord, you couldn't.\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:31.240\n You just have to judge based on the voice.\n\n35:31.240 --> 35:34.960\n But there's something about the listening\n\n35:34.960 --> 35:37.920\n and the intimacy of being surprised\n\n35:37.920 --> 35:40.080\n by different strangers that feels almost\n\n35:40.080 --> 35:43.560\n like a party with friends.\n\n35:43.560 --> 35:45.320\n And friends of friends you haven't met yet,\n\n35:45.320 --> 35:47.280\n but you really like.\n\n35:47.280 --> 35:49.680\n Now clubhouse also has an interesting innovation\n\n35:49.680 --> 35:52.280\n where there's a large crowd that just listens\n\n35:52.280 --> 35:54.120\n and there's a stage.\n\n35:54.120 --> 35:56.320\n And you can bring people up onto stage.\n\n35:56.320 --> 35:59.200\n So only people on stage are talking.\n\n35:59.200 --> 36:01.320\n And you can have like five, six, seven, eight,\n\n36:01.320 --> 36:03.320\n sometimes 20, 30 people on stage.\n\n36:03.320 --> 36:05.200\n And then you can also have thousands of people\n\n36:05.200 --> 36:06.040\n just listening.\n\n36:06.040 --> 36:06.880\n I see.\n\n36:06.880 --> 36:08.880\n So there's a, I don't know,\n\n36:08.880 --> 36:10.760\n a lot of people are being surprised by this.\n\n36:10.760 --> 36:12.280\n Why is it called a social network?\n\n36:12.280 --> 36:14.200\n It seems like it doesn't have, there's not social links.\n\n36:14.200 --> 36:17.200\n There's not a feed that's trying to harvest attention.\n\n36:17.200 --> 36:19.160\n It feels like a communication.\n\n36:20.160 --> 36:24.160\n So the social network aspect is you follow people.\n\n36:24.160 --> 36:26.160\n And the people you follow,\n\n36:26.160 --> 36:27.600\n now this is like the first social network\n\n36:27.600 --> 36:30.440\n that is actually correct use of follow, I think.\n\n36:30.440 --> 36:35.080\n You're more likely to see the rooms they're in.\n\n36:35.080 --> 36:37.200\n So there's a, your feed is a bunch of rooms\n\n36:37.200 --> 36:39.120\n that are going on right now.\n\n36:39.120 --> 36:43.360\n And the people you follow are the ones\n\n36:43.360 --> 36:44.800\n that will increase the likelihood\n\n36:44.800 --> 36:46.360\n that you'll see the room they're in.\n\n36:46.360 --> 36:48.480\n And so the final result is like,\n\n36:48.480 --> 36:50.320\n there's a list of really interesting rooms.\n\n36:50.320 --> 36:53.800\n Like I have all these, I've been speaking Russian\n\n36:53.800 --> 36:55.880\n quite a bit, there's practicing,\n\n36:55.880 --> 36:58.200\n but also just like talking politics\n\n36:58.200 --> 37:00.080\n and philosophy in Russian.\n\n37:00.080 --> 37:01.160\n I've never done that before,\n\n37:01.160 --> 37:03.320\n but it allows me to connect with that community.\n\n37:03.320 --> 37:05.640\n And then there's a community of people,\n\n37:05.640 --> 37:09.160\n like it's funny, but like I'll go in a community\n\n37:09.160 --> 37:12.160\n of all African American people talking about race\n\n37:12.160 --> 37:13.920\n and I'll be welcomed.\n\n37:13.920 --> 37:17.040\n I've never had, like I've literally never been\n\n37:17.040 --> 37:20.200\n in a difficult conversation about race,\n\n37:20.200 --> 37:22.520\n like with people from all over the place.\n\n37:22.520 --> 37:23.440\n It's like fascinating.\n\n37:23.440 --> 37:26.400\n And then musicians, jazz musicians, I don't know.\n\n37:26.400 --> 37:28.400\n You could say that a lot of other places\n\n37:28.400 --> 37:31.280\n could have created that culture, I suppose.\n\n37:31.280 --> 37:32.960\n Twitter and Facebook a lot for that culture,\n\n37:32.960 --> 37:35.880\n but there's something about this network\n\n37:35.880 --> 37:39.200\n as it stands now, cause no Android users.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:42.720\n It's probably just because it's iPhone people.\n\n37:43.800 --> 37:44.640\n It's like.\n\n37:44.640 --> 37:45.480\n Less conspiratorial or something.\n\n37:45.480 --> 37:47.320\n Well, like less, listen, I'm an Android person.\n\n37:47.320 --> 37:50.120\n So I got an iPhone just for this network, which is funny.\n\n37:52.400 --> 37:55.920\n For now it's all like, there's very few trolls.\n\n37:55.920 --> 37:57.240\n There's very few people that are trying\n\n37:57.240 --> 37:59.240\n to manipulate the system and so on.\n\n37:59.240 --> 38:00.920\n So I don't know, it's interesting.\n\n38:00.920 --> 38:03.600\n Now the downside, the reason you're going to hate it\n\n38:04.760 --> 38:08.520\n is because it's so intimate, because it pulls you in\n\n38:08.520 --> 38:11.320\n and pulls in very successful people like you,\n\n38:11.320 --> 38:15.960\n just like really successful, productive, very busy people.\n\n38:20.040 --> 38:21.360\n It's a huge time sink.\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:23.640\n It's very difficult to pull yourself out.\n\n38:23.640 --> 38:25.080\n Interesting, you mean once you're in a room?\n\n38:25.080 --> 38:27.760\n Well, no, leaving the room is actually easy.\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:30.480\n The beautiful thing about a stage with multiple people,\n\n38:30.480 --> 38:33.600\n there's a little button that says leave quietly.\n\n38:33.600 --> 38:38.520\n So culture, no etiquette wise, it's okay to just leave.\n\n38:38.520 --> 38:41.000\n So you and I in a room, when it's just you and I,\n\n38:41.000 --> 38:42.200\n it's a little awkward to leave.\n\n38:42.200 --> 38:44.240\n If you're asking questions, I'm just gone.\n\n38:44.240 --> 38:47.760\n But, and actually if you're being interviewed for the book,\n\n38:47.760 --> 38:51.040\n that's weird because you're now in the event\n\n38:51.040 --> 38:54.000\n and you're supposed to, but usually the person interviewing\n\n38:54.000 --> 38:55.920\n would be like, okay, it's time for you to go.\n\n38:55.920 --> 38:59.960\n It's more normal, but the normal way to use the room\n\n38:59.960 --> 39:02.840\n was like, you're just opening the app\n\n39:02.840 --> 39:05.480\n and there'll be like, I don't know, Sam Harris,\n\n39:06.840 --> 39:11.840\n Eric Weinstein, I think Joe Rogan showed up to the app,\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:13.960\n Bill Gates, these people on stage\n\n39:13.960 --> 39:15.840\n just like randomly just plugged in\n\n39:15.840 --> 39:18.000\n and then you'll step up on stage,\n\n39:18.000 --> 39:20.360\n listen, maybe you won't contribute at all,\n\n39:20.360 --> 39:22.000\n maybe you'll say something funny\n\n39:22.000 --> 39:23.400\n and then you'll just leave.\n\n39:23.400 --> 39:26.880\n And there's the addicting aspect to it.\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:30.040\n The reason it's a time sink is you don't wanna leave.\n\n39:30.040 --> 39:33.440\n What I've noticed about exceptionally busy people\n\n39:33.440 --> 39:35.600\n that they love this.\n\n39:35.600 --> 39:37.280\n I think it might have to do with the pandemic.\n\n39:37.280 --> 39:38.240\n It might be a little bit, yeah.\n\n39:38.240 --> 39:39.240\n There's a loneliness.\n\n39:39.240 --> 39:40.560\n They're all starved, yeah.\n\n39:40.560 --> 39:42.480\n But also it's really cool people.\n\n39:42.480 --> 39:43.320\n Yeah.\n\n39:43.320 --> 39:46.040\n Like when was the last time you talked to Sam Harris\n\n39:46.040 --> 39:48.760\n or whoever, like think of anybody,\n\n39:48.760 --> 39:52.120\n Tyler Copeland, like any faculty.\n\n39:52.120 --> 39:54.840\n This is like what universities strive to create,\n\n39:54.840 --> 39:57.680\n but it's taken hundreds of years of cultural evolution\n\n39:57.680 --> 39:59.640\n to try to get a lot of interesting, smart people together\n\n39:59.640 --> 40:00.640\n that run into each other.\n\n40:00.640 --> 40:04.600\n We have really strong faculty in a room together\n\n40:04.600 --> 40:05.760\n with no scheduling.\n\n40:05.760 --> 40:07.160\n This is the power of it.\n\n40:07.160 --> 40:08.760\n It's like you just show up,\n\n40:08.760 --> 40:11.320\n there's none of that baggage of scheduling and so on\n\n40:11.320 --> 40:13.880\n and there's no pressure to leave, sorry,\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:15.080\n no pressure to stay.\n\n40:15.080 --> 40:16.680\n It's very easy for you to leave.\n\n40:16.680 --> 40:19.240\n You realize that there's a lot of constraints on meetings\n\n40:19.240 --> 40:24.240\n and like faculty, like even stopping by before the pandemic,\n\n40:25.520 --> 40:28.400\n a friend or faculty or colleague and so on,\n\n40:28.400 --> 40:30.040\n there's a weirdness about leaving.\n\n40:30.040 --> 40:31.040\n Yeah.\n\n40:31.040 --> 40:33.240\n But here there's not a weirdness about leaving.\n\n40:33.240 --> 40:36.040\n So they've discovered something interesting.\n\n40:36.040 --> 40:38.800\n But the final result when you observe it\n\n40:38.800 --> 40:41.080\n is it's very fulfilling.\n\n40:41.080 --> 40:44.840\n I think it's very beneficial, but it's very addicting.\n\n40:44.840 --> 40:48.520\n So you have to make sure you moderate.\n\n40:48.520 --> 40:50.160\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n40:50.160 --> 40:52.160\n Okay, well, so maybe I'll try it.\n\n40:52.160 --> 40:53.520\n I mean, look, there's no,\n\n40:53.520 --> 40:54.720\n the things that make me suspicious\n\n40:54.720 --> 40:56.640\n about other platforms aren't here.\n\n40:56.640 --> 41:00.480\n So the feed is not full of user generated content\n\n41:00.480 --> 41:02.800\n that is going through some sort of algorithmic rating process\n\n41:02.800 --> 41:05.760\n with all the weird incentives and nudging that does.\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:08.840\n And you're not producing content that's being harvested\n\n41:08.840 --> 41:11.240\n to be monetized by another company.\n\n41:11.240 --> 41:14.360\n I mean, it seems like it's more ephemeral, right?\n\n41:14.360 --> 41:15.760\n You're here, you're talking.\n\n41:15.760 --> 41:17.880\n The feed is just actually just showing you\n\n41:17.880 --> 41:19.320\n here's interesting things happening, right?\n\n41:19.320 --> 41:21.040\n You're not jockeying in the feed for,\n\n41:21.040 --> 41:22.400\n look, I'm being clever or something\n\n41:22.400 --> 41:24.640\n and I'm gonna get a light count that goes up\n\n41:24.640 --> 41:26.640\n and that's gonna influence.\n\n41:26.640 --> 41:27.520\n And there's more friction.\n\n41:27.520 --> 41:28.960\n There's more cognitive friction, I guess,\n\n41:28.960 --> 41:31.360\n involved in listening to smart people\n\n41:31.360 --> 41:33.480\n versus scrolling through.\n\n41:33.480 --> 41:34.440\n Yeah, there's something there.\n\n41:34.440 --> 41:35.320\n So there's no.\n\n41:35.320 --> 41:37.160\n Why are people so, I see all,\n\n41:37.160 --> 41:39.200\n there's all these articles that seem,\n\n41:39.200 --> 41:40.360\n I haven't really read them.\n\n41:40.360 --> 41:42.320\n Why are reporters negative about this?\n\n41:42.320 --> 41:43.240\n Competition.\n\n41:43.240 --> 41:44.880\n The New York Times wrote this article called\n\n41:44.880 --> 41:49.120\n Unfettered Conversations Happening on Clubhouse is.\n\n41:49.120 --> 41:51.080\n So I'm right in picking up a tone\n\n41:51.080 --> 41:51.920\n even from the headlines\n\n41:51.920 --> 41:55.000\n that there's some like negative vibes from the press.\n\n41:55.000 --> 41:58.400\n No, so I can say, let's say,\n\n41:58.400 --> 42:00.880\n well, I'll tell you what the article was saying,\n\n42:00.880 --> 42:05.680\n which is they're having cancellable conversations,\n\n42:05.680 --> 42:07.240\n like the biggest people in the world\n\n42:07.240 --> 42:08.920\n almost trolling the press.\n\n42:08.920 --> 42:09.760\n Right.\n\n42:09.760 --> 42:10.600\n And the press is desperately.\n\n42:10.600 --> 42:11.440\n Like foreshanning the press.\n\n42:11.440 --> 42:13.120\n Yeah, foreshanning the press.\n\n42:13.120 --> 42:16.680\n By saying that you guys are looking for click bait\n\n42:16.680 --> 42:19.200\n from our genuine human conversations.\n\n42:19.200 --> 42:23.000\n And so I think the, honestly,\n\n42:23.000 --> 42:25.400\n the press is just like, what do we do with this?\n\n42:25.400 --> 42:28.880\n We can't, first of all, it's a lot of work for them.\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:29.920\n Okay.\n\n42:29.920 --> 42:32.320\n It's what Naval says, which is like,\n\n42:32.320 --> 42:34.520\n this is skipping the journalist.\n\n42:34.520 --> 42:37.080\n Like the interview you, if you go on Clubhouse,\n\n42:37.080 --> 42:39.640\n the interview you might do for the book\n\n42:39.640 --> 42:41.360\n will be with somebody who's like a journalist\n\n42:41.360 --> 42:42.320\n and interviewing you.\n\n42:42.320 --> 42:43.160\n Yeah.\n\n42:43.160 --> 42:44.760\n That's more traditional.\n\n42:44.760 --> 42:45.600\n Yeah.\n\n42:45.600 --> 42:47.200\n It'd be a good introduction for you to try it.\n\n42:47.200 --> 42:52.200\n But like the way to use Clubhouse is you just show up\n\n42:52.960 --> 42:55.560\n and it's like, again, like me, I'm sorry,\n\n42:55.560 --> 42:58.880\n I'm like, boy, I keep mentioning Sam Harris\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:00.480\n as if it's like the only person I know,\n\n43:00.480 --> 43:03.600\n but like a lot of these major faculty,\n\n43:03.600 --> 43:04.840\n I don't know, Max Tegmark.\n\n43:04.840 --> 43:07.360\n Like just major faculty just sitting there\n\n43:07.360 --> 43:10.840\n and then you show up and then I'll ask like,\n\n43:10.840 --> 43:12.680\n oh, don't you have a book coming out or something?\n\n43:12.680 --> 43:14.360\n And then you'll talk about the book\n\n43:14.360 --> 43:15.640\n and then you'll leave five minutes later\n\n43:15.640 --> 43:17.360\n because you have to go get coffee included.\n\n43:17.360 --> 43:18.200\n Interesting.\n\n43:18.200 --> 43:20.920\n So like that's the, it's not the journalistic,\n\n43:20.920 --> 43:23.840\n you're not gonna actually enjoy the interview as much\n\n43:23.840 --> 43:26.120\n because it'll be like the normal thing.\n\n43:26.120 --> 43:26.960\n Yeah.\n\n43:26.960 --> 43:28.800\n Like you're there 40 minutes or an hour\n\n43:28.800 --> 43:30.560\n and there'll be questions from the audience.\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:31.400\n Right.\n\n43:31.400 --> 43:33.720\n Like I'm doing an event next week for the book launch\n\n43:33.720 --> 43:37.360\n where it's like Jason Fried and I are talking about email,\n\n43:37.360 --> 43:40.120\n but it's using some more like a thousand people\n\n43:40.120 --> 43:41.560\n who are there to watch virtually,\n\n43:41.560 --> 43:44.720\n but it's using some sort of traditional webinar.\n\n43:44.720 --> 43:46.000\n Clubhouse would be a situation\n\n43:46.000 --> 43:47.560\n where that could just happen informally.\n\n43:47.560 --> 43:49.000\n Like I jump in like Jason's there\n\n43:49.000 --> 43:51.920\n and then someone else jumps in and yeah, that's interesting.\n\n43:51.920 --> 43:53.920\n But for now it's still closed.\n\n43:53.920 --> 43:56.160\n So even though there's a lot of excitement\n\n43:56.160 --> 43:58.920\n and there'll be quite famous people\n\n43:58.920 --> 44:00.320\n just sitting there listening to you.\n\n44:00.320 --> 44:01.800\n Yeah.\n\n44:01.800 --> 44:04.280\n But the numbers aren't exactly high.\n\n44:04.280 --> 44:05.920\n So you're talking about rooms,\n\n44:05.920 --> 44:09.320\n like even the huge rooms are like just a few thousand.\n\n44:09.320 --> 44:10.160\n Right.\n\n44:10.160 --> 44:12.600\n And this is probably like Soho in the 50s or something too.\n\n44:12.600 --> 44:15.400\n Just because of the exponential growth,\n\n44:15.400 --> 44:17.080\n give it seven more months.\n\n44:17.080 --> 44:19.440\n And if you let one invite be, it gets two invites,\n\n44:19.440 --> 44:20.280\n it gets four invites,\n\n44:20.280 --> 44:22.120\n because pretty soon it'll be everyone.\n\n44:22.120 --> 44:25.360\n And then the rooms in your feed are gonna be whatever,\n\n44:25.360 --> 44:27.760\n marketing, performance enhancing drugs or something like that.\n\n44:27.760 --> 44:28.600\n Exactly.\n\n44:28.600 --> 44:29.440\n Yeah.\n\n44:29.440 --> 44:30.560\n But then in a bunch of competitors,\n\n44:30.560 --> 44:33.240\n there's already like 30 plus competitors sprung up,\n\n44:33.240 --> 44:34.360\n Twitter spaces.\n\n44:34.360 --> 44:36.160\n So Twitter is creating a competitor\n\n44:36.160 --> 44:38.520\n that's going to likely destroy Clubhouse\n\n44:38.520 --> 44:40.480\n because they just have a much larger user base\n\n44:40.480 --> 44:42.400\n and they already have a social network.\n\n44:42.400 --> 44:46.400\n So I would be very cautious, of course,\n\n44:46.400 --> 44:47.560\n with the addictive element,\n\n44:47.560 --> 44:49.280\n but it doesn't just like you said,\n\n44:49.280 --> 44:52.080\n this particular implementation in its early stages\n\n44:52.080 --> 44:53.320\n doesn't have the like,\n\n44:56.040 --> 44:58.000\n it doesn't have the context switching problem.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:58.840\n Yeah.\n\n44:58.840 --> 45:01.120\n You'll just switch to it and you'll be stuck.\n\n45:01.120 --> 45:02.840\n Yeah, to keep a context is great.\n\n45:02.840 --> 45:04.360\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n45:04.360 --> 45:07.640\n But then I think the best way I've found to use it\n\n45:07.640 --> 45:12.640\n is to acknowledge that these things pull you in.\n\n45:12.920 --> 45:13.760\n Yeah.\n\n45:13.760 --> 45:17.000\n So I've used it in the past,\n\n45:17.000 --> 45:19.120\n like almost, I'll go get a coffee\n\n45:19.120 --> 45:20.880\n and I'll tune into a conversation\n\n45:22.040 --> 45:24.360\n as if that's how I use podcasts sometimes.\n\n45:24.360 --> 45:26.920\n I'll just like play a little bit of a podcast\n\n45:26.920 --> 45:29.600\n and then I can just turn it off.\n\n45:29.600 --> 45:31.880\n The problem with these is it pulls you in,\n\n45:31.880 --> 45:32.800\n it's really interesting.\n\n45:32.800 --> 45:35.400\n And then the other problem that you'll experience\n\n45:35.400 --> 45:38.000\n is like somebody will recognize you.\n\n45:38.000 --> 45:38.840\n Yeah.\n\n45:38.840 --> 45:40.400\n And then they'll be like, oh, Lex.\n\n45:40.400 --> 45:41.320\n Come on up.\n\n45:41.320 --> 45:42.160\n Come on.\n\n45:42.160 --> 45:43.440\n Oh, hey, I had a question for you.\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:46.600\n And then it takes a lot for you to go like,\n\n45:46.600 --> 45:47.600\n to ignore that.\n\n45:47.600 --> 45:48.520\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n45:48.520 --> 45:49.360\n So. Yeah.\n\n45:49.360 --> 45:51.080\n And then you pulled in and it's fascinating\n\n45:51.080 --> 45:52.280\n and it's really cool people.\n\n45:52.280 --> 45:53.840\n So it's like a source of a lot of joy,\n\n45:53.840 --> 45:58.120\n but you have to be very, very careful.\n\n45:58.120 --> 46:00.160\n The reason I brought it up is we,\n\n46:00.160 --> 46:04.120\n there's a room, there's an entire club actually on burnout.\n\n46:04.120 --> 46:08.120\n And I brought you up and I brought David Goggins\n\n46:08.120 --> 46:10.960\n as the process I go through, which is,\n\n46:10.960 --> 46:14.920\n my passion goes up and down, it dips.\n\n46:14.920 --> 46:17.920\n And I don't think I trust my own mind\n\n46:17.920 --> 46:22.600\n to tell me whether I'm getting close to burnout\n\n46:22.600 --> 46:24.800\n or exhaustion or not.\n\n46:24.800 --> 46:28.280\n I kind of go with the David Goggins model of,\n\n46:28.280 --> 46:30.240\n I mean, he's probably more applying it to running,\n\n46:30.240 --> 46:35.120\n but when it feels like your mind can't take any more,\n\n46:35.120 --> 46:38.920\n that you're just 40% at your capacity.\n\n46:38.920 --> 46:41.040\n I mean, it's just like an arbitrary level.\n\n46:41.040 --> 46:41.880\n It's the Navy SEAL thing, right?\n\n46:41.880 --> 46:43.040\n The Navy SEAL thing.\n\n46:43.040 --> 46:44.600\n I mean, you could put that at any percent,\n\n46:44.600 --> 46:48.080\n but it is remarkable that if you just take it\n\n46:48.080 --> 46:49.960\n one step at a time, just keep going,\n\n46:49.960 --> 46:53.360\n it's similar to this idea of a process.\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:55.840\n If you just trust the process and you just keep following,\n\n46:55.840 --> 46:58.400\n even if the passion goes up and down and so on,\n\n46:58.400 --> 47:02.720\n then ultimately, if you look in aggregate,\n\n47:02.720 --> 47:04.400\n the passion will increase.\n\n47:04.400 --> 47:06.560\n Your self satisfaction will increase.\n\n47:06.560 --> 47:08.280\n And if you have two things,\n\n47:08.280 --> 47:09.760\n this has been a big strategy of mine,\n\n47:09.760 --> 47:14.200\n so that what you hope for is off phase, off phase alignment.\n\n47:14.200 --> 47:16.520\n Sometimes it's in phase and that's a problem,\n\n47:16.520 --> 47:18.040\n but off phase alignment's good.\n\n47:18.040 --> 47:20.680\n So, okay, my research, I'm struggling,\n\n47:20.680 --> 47:22.680\n but my book stuff is going well, right?\n\n47:22.680 --> 47:24.760\n And so when you add those two waves together,\n\n47:24.760 --> 47:25.720\n like, oh, we're doing pretty well.\n\n47:25.720 --> 47:28.400\n And then in other periods, like on my writing,\n\n47:28.400 --> 47:29.880\n I feel like I'm just not getting anywhere,\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:32.360\n but I've had some good papers, I'm feeling good over there.\n\n47:32.360 --> 47:35.960\n So having two things that can counteract each other.\n\n47:35.960 --> 47:38.640\n Now, sometimes they fall into sync and then it gets rough.\n\n47:38.640 --> 47:40.240\n Then when, you know, when everything,\n\n47:40.240 --> 47:41.720\n because everything for me is cyclical,\n\n47:41.720 --> 47:43.240\n good periods, bad periods with all this stuff.\n\n47:43.240 --> 47:47.560\n So typically they don't coincide, so it helps compensate.\n\n47:47.560 --> 47:50.360\n When they do coincide, you get really high highs,\n\n47:50.360 --> 47:51.200\n like where everything's clicking,\n\n47:51.200 --> 47:52.760\n and then you get these really low lows\n\n47:52.760 --> 47:54.680\n where like your research is not working,\n\n47:54.680 --> 47:56.360\n your program's not clicking,\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:59.280\n you feel like you're nowhere with your writing,\n\n47:59.280 --> 48:00.680\n and then it's a little rougher.\n\n48:00.680 --> 48:04.000\n Is, do you think about the concept of burnout?\n\n48:04.000 --> 48:06.360\n Because I personally have never experienced burnout\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:08.240\n in the way that folks talk about,\n\n48:08.240 --> 48:11.680\n which is like, it's not just the up and down.\n\n48:11.680 --> 48:14.720\n It's like, you don't want to do anything ever again.\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:15.560\n Yeah.\n\n48:15.560 --> 48:17.640\n It's like, for some people it's like physical,\n\n48:17.640 --> 48:19.680\n like to the hospital kind of thing.\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:22.800\n Yeah, so I do worry about it.\n\n48:22.800 --> 48:24.760\n So when I used to do student writing,\n\n48:24.760 --> 48:27.360\n like writing about students and student advice,\n\n48:27.360 --> 48:30.360\n it came up a lot with students at elite schools,\n\n48:30.360 --> 48:32.360\n and I used to call it deep procrastination,\n\n48:32.360 --> 48:37.360\n but it was a real, really vivid, very replicatable syndrome\n\n48:37.600 --> 48:39.600\n where they stop being able to do schoolwork.\n\n48:39.600 --> 48:40.440\n Yeah.\n\n48:40.440 --> 48:42.920\n Like this is due, and the professor gives you an extension,\n\n48:42.920 --> 48:44.280\n and the professor gives you an incomplete,\n\n48:44.280 --> 48:46.120\n and says, you got it, you were gonna fail the course,\n\n48:46.120 --> 48:48.680\n you have to hand this in, and they can't do it, right?\n\n48:48.680 --> 48:50.600\n It's like a complete stop\n\n48:50.600 --> 48:52.400\n on the ability to actually do work.\n\n48:52.400 --> 48:54.120\n And so I used to counsel students who had that issue,\n\n48:54.120 --> 48:56.480\n and often it was a combination of,\n\n48:56.480 --> 48:58.680\n this is my best analysis,\n\n48:58.680 --> 49:01.360\n is you have just the physical and cognitive difficulties\n\n49:01.360 --> 49:03.680\n of they're usually under a very hard load, right?\n\n49:03.680 --> 49:05.520\n They're doing too many majors, too many extracurriculars,\n\n49:05.520 --> 49:07.480\n just really pushing themselves,\n\n49:07.480 --> 49:11.440\n and the motivation is not sufficiently intrinsic.\n\n49:11.440 --> 49:12.280\n Right.\n\n49:12.280 --> 49:13.320\n So if you have a motivational center\n\n49:13.320 --> 49:14.440\n that's not completely on board,\n\n49:14.440 --> 49:16.720\n so a lot of these kids, like when I'm dealing with MIT kids,\n\n49:16.720 --> 49:20.200\n they would be, their whole town was shooting off fireworks\n\n49:20.200 --> 49:21.040\n that they got in.\n\n49:21.040 --> 49:23.480\n Everyone's hoped that they were going there,\n\n49:23.480 --> 49:24.640\n and that they're in three majors,\n\n49:24.640 --> 49:25.640\n they don't wanna let people down,\n\n49:25.640 --> 49:26.560\n but they're not really interested\n\n49:26.560 --> 49:28.200\n in being a doctor or whatever.\n\n49:28.200 --> 49:30.080\n So your motivation's not in the right place.\n\n49:30.080 --> 49:31.600\n The motivational psychologist would say\n\n49:31.600 --> 49:33.160\n the locus of control was more towards\n\n49:33.160 --> 49:36.640\n the extrinsic end of the spectrum, and you have hardship.\n\n49:36.640 --> 49:38.840\n And you could just fritz out the whole system.\n\n49:38.840 --> 49:40.560\n And so I would always be very worried about that.\n\n49:40.560 --> 49:41.880\n So I think about that a lot.\n\n49:41.880 --> 49:45.400\n I do a lot of multi phase or multi scale seasonality.\n\n49:45.400 --> 49:48.160\n So I'll go hard on something for a while,\n\n49:48.160 --> 49:50.320\n and then for a few weeks, go easy.\n\n49:50.320 --> 49:51.960\n I'll have semesters that are hard,\n\n49:51.960 --> 49:53.120\n and semesters that are easy.\n\n49:53.120 --> 49:54.160\n Or I'll take the summer really low.\n\n49:54.160 --> 49:55.200\n So on multiple scales,\n\n49:55.200 --> 49:56.680\n and in the day I'll go really hard on something,\n\n49:56.680 --> 49:57.920\n but then have a hard cut off at five.\n\n49:57.920 --> 50:01.920\n So like every scale, it's all about rest and recovery.\n\n50:01.920 --> 50:02.960\n Because I really wanna avoid that.\n\n50:02.960 --> 50:03.800\n And I do burn out.\n\n50:03.800 --> 50:06.600\n I burnt out, pretty recently I get minor burnt outs.\n\n50:06.600 --> 50:10.080\n I got a couple papers that I was trying to work through\n\n50:10.080 --> 50:12.760\n for a deadline a few weeks ago,\n\n50:12.760 --> 50:14.680\n and I wasn't sleeping well,\n\n50:14.680 --> 50:17.520\n and there's some other things going on.\n\n50:17.520 --> 50:20.320\n And it just knocks out and I get sick usually,\n\n50:20.320 --> 50:22.400\n is how I know I've pushed myself too far.\n\n50:22.400 --> 50:23.440\n And so I kind of pulled it back.\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:24.440\n Now I'm doing this book launch.\n\n50:24.440 --> 50:26.700\n Then after this book launch, I'm pulling it back again.\n\n50:26.700 --> 50:29.040\n So I like seasonality for rest and recovery,\n\n50:29.040 --> 50:30.160\n I think it's crucial.\n\n50:30.160 --> 50:33.720\n And at every scale, daily, monthly,\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:34.920\n and then at the annual scale.\n\n50:34.920 --> 50:36.280\n An easy summer, for example,\n\n50:36.280 --> 50:38.900\n I think is like a great idea if that's possible.\n\n50:38.900 --> 50:41.260\n Okay, you just made me realize\n\n50:41.260 --> 50:43.280\n that that's exactly what I do.\n\n50:43.280 --> 50:45.160\n Because I feel like I'm not even close\n\n50:45.160 --> 50:46.120\n to burnout or anything.\n\n50:46.120 --> 50:48.800\n Even though I'm in chaos,\n\n50:49.660 --> 50:52.440\n I feel the right exact way is the seasonality,\n\n50:52.440 --> 50:55.200\n is the, not even the seasonality,\n\n50:55.200 --> 50:59.020\n but like you always have multiple seasons operating.\n\n50:59.020 --> 51:00.120\n It's like you said,\n\n51:00.120 --> 51:02.840\n because when you have a lot of cool shit going on,\n\n51:02.840 --> 51:06.320\n there's always at least one thing that's a source of joy,\n\n51:06.320 --> 51:08.740\n that there's always a reason.\n\n51:08.740 --> 51:10.900\n I suppose the fundamental thing,\n\n51:10.900 --> 51:13.800\n and I've known people that suffer from depression too,\n\n51:13.800 --> 51:16.760\n the fundamental problem with the experience of depression\n\n51:16.760 --> 51:21.760\n and burnout is why do, life is meaningless.\n\n51:21.840 --> 51:26.840\n And I always have an answer of why today could be cool.\n\n51:28.160 --> 51:29.920\n And you have to contrive it, right?\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:31.720\n If you don't have it, you have to contrive it.\n\n51:31.720 --> 51:33.140\n I think it's really important.\n\n51:33.140 --> 51:34.800\n Like, okay, well, this is going bad,\n\n51:34.800 --> 51:37.240\n so now is the time to start thinking about,\n\n51:37.240 --> 51:39.840\n I mean, look, I started a podcast during the pandemic.\n\n51:39.840 --> 51:43.060\n It's like, this is going pretty bad, but you know what?\n\n51:43.060 --> 51:46.320\n This could be something really interesting.\n\n51:46.320 --> 51:48.040\n Deep questions with Kyle Newport.\n\n51:49.140 --> 51:50.480\n I do it all in that voice.\n\n51:50.480 --> 51:53.460\n I love the podcast, by the way.\n\n51:53.460 --> 51:56.780\n But yeah, I think David Foster Wallace said,\n\n51:56.780 --> 51:59.120\n the key to life is to be unboreable.\n\n51:59.120 --> 52:01.800\n I've always kind of taken that to heart,\n\n52:01.800 --> 52:05.840\n which is like, you should be able to maybe artificially\n\n52:05.840 --> 52:08.680\n generate anything.\n\n52:08.680 --> 52:13.680\n Like, find something in your environment,\n\n52:13.960 --> 52:16.080\n in your surroundings, that's a source of joy.\n\n52:16.080 --> 52:17.400\n Like, everything is fun.\n\n52:17.400 --> 52:18.520\n Yeah.\n\n52:18.520 --> 52:20.120\n Did you read The Pale King?\n\n52:20.120 --> 52:21.540\n It goes deep on boredom.\n\n52:21.540 --> 52:22.980\n It's like uncomfortable.\n\n52:22.980 --> 52:25.660\n It's like an uncomfortable meditation on boredom.\n\n52:25.660 --> 52:27.680\n Like, the characters in that are just driven\n\n52:27.680 --> 52:31.660\n to the extremes of, I just bought three books on boredom\n\n52:31.660 --> 52:35.160\n the other day, so now I'm really interested in this topic.\n\n52:35.160 --> 52:37.200\n Because I was anxious about my book launch\n\n52:37.200 --> 52:38.040\n happening this week.\n\n52:38.040 --> 52:39.600\n So I was like, okay, I need something else.\n\n52:39.600 --> 52:42.560\n So I have this idea for, I might do it as an article first,\n\n52:42.560 --> 52:43.600\n but as a book.\n\n52:43.600 --> 52:46.800\n Like, okay, I need something cool to be thinking about.\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:48.160\n Because I was worried about, like,\n\n52:48.160 --> 52:50.440\n I don't know if the launch's gonna work, the pandemic,\n\n52:50.440 --> 52:52.160\n what's gonna happen, I don't know if it's gonna get there.\n\n52:52.160 --> 52:54.160\n So this is exactly what we're talking about.\n\n52:54.160 --> 52:56.040\n So I went out and I bought a bunch of books,\n\n52:56.040 --> 53:00.240\n and I'm beginning like a whole intellectual exploration.\n\n53:00.240 --> 53:03.040\n Well, I think that's one of the profound ideas\n\n53:03.040 --> 53:06.480\n in deep work that you don't expand on too much\n\n53:06.480 --> 53:08.440\n is boredom.\n\n53:08.440 --> 53:12.600\n Yeah, well, so deep work had a superficial idea\n\n53:12.600 --> 53:13.880\n about boredom, which was,\n\n53:13.880 --> 53:16.160\n I had this chapter called Embrace Boredom,\n\n53:16.160 --> 53:19.800\n and a very functionalist idea was basically,\n\n53:19.800 --> 53:21.800\n you have to have some boredom in your regular schedule,\n\n53:21.800 --> 53:25.040\n or your mind is gonna form a Pavlovian connection\n\n53:25.040 --> 53:28.520\n between as soon as I feel boredom, I get stimuli.\n\n53:28.520 --> 53:29.680\n And once it forms that connection,\n\n53:29.680 --> 53:30.880\n it's never gonna tolerate deep work.\n\n53:30.880 --> 53:34.320\n So there's this very pragmatic treatment of boredom\n\n53:34.320 --> 53:36.720\n of your mind better be used to the idea\n\n53:36.720 --> 53:37.920\n that sometimes you don't get stimuli\n\n53:37.920 --> 53:39.800\n because otherwise you can't write for three hours,\n\n53:39.800 --> 53:41.840\n like it's just not gonna tolerate it.\n\n53:41.840 --> 53:44.120\n But more recently, what I'm really interested in boredom\n\n53:44.120 --> 53:47.240\n is it as a fundamental human drive, right?\n\n53:47.240 --> 53:49.760\n Because it's incredibly uncomfortable.\n\n53:49.760 --> 53:51.000\n And think about the other things\n\n53:51.000 --> 53:53.280\n that are incredibly uncomfortable, like hunger or thirst,\n\n53:53.280 --> 53:56.680\n they serve a really important purpose for a species, right?\n\n53:56.680 --> 53:58.760\n Like if something is really distressing, there's a reason.\n\n53:58.760 --> 54:00.000\n Pain is really uncomfortable\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:02.440\n because we need to worry about getting injured.\n\n54:02.440 --> 54:03.680\n Thirst is really uncomfortable\n\n54:03.680 --> 54:05.560\n because we need water to survive.\n\n54:05.560 --> 54:07.000\n So what's boredom?\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:08.680\n Why is that uncomfortable?\n\n54:08.680 --> 54:11.480\n And I've been interested in this notion\n\n54:11.480 --> 54:16.480\n that boredom is about driving us towards productive action.\n\n54:17.360 --> 54:19.200\n Like as a species, I mean, think about it,\n\n54:19.200 --> 54:22.320\n like what got us to actually take advantage of these brains?\n\n54:22.320 --> 54:24.400\n What got us to actually work with fire?\n\n54:24.400 --> 54:27.680\n What got us to start shaping stones and the hand axes\n\n54:27.680 --> 54:29.680\n and figuring out if we could actually sharpen a stick\n\n54:29.680 --> 54:32.320\n sharp enough that we could throw it as a melee weapon\n\n54:32.320 --> 54:35.240\n or a distance weapon for hunting mammoth, right?\n\n54:35.240 --> 54:37.920\n Boredom drives us towards action.\n\n54:37.920 --> 54:41.440\n So now I'm fascinated by this fundamental action instinct\n\n54:41.440 --> 54:43.520\n because I have this theory that I'm working on\n\n54:43.520 --> 54:45.760\n that we're out of sync with it.\n\n54:45.760 --> 54:47.880\n Just like we have this drive for hunger,\n\n54:47.880 --> 54:49.040\n but then we introduced junk food\n\n54:49.040 --> 54:50.280\n and got out of sync with hunger\n\n54:50.280 --> 54:52.040\n and it makes us really unhealthy.\n\n54:52.040 --> 54:53.400\n We have this drive towards action,\n\n54:53.400 --> 54:55.400\n but then we overload ourselves\n\n54:55.400 --> 54:56.760\n and we have all of these distractions.\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:58.560\n And then that causes,\n\n54:58.560 --> 55:01.440\n it's like a cognitive action obesity type things\n\n55:01.440 --> 55:02.800\n because it short circuits this system\n\n55:02.800 --> 55:03.760\n that wants us to do things,\n\n55:03.760 --> 55:05.680\n but we put more things on our plate than we can possibly do\n\n55:05.680 --> 55:07.440\n and then we're really frustrated we can't do them\n\n55:07.440 --> 55:09.160\n and we're short circuiting all of our wires.\n\n55:09.160 --> 55:11.520\n So it all comes back to this question,\n\n55:11.520 --> 55:16.520\n well, what would be the ideal sort of amount of stuff\n\n55:16.840 --> 55:18.360\n to do and type of things to do?\n\n55:18.360 --> 55:20.600\n Like if we wanted to look back at our ancestral environment\n\n55:20.600 --> 55:23.920\n and say, if I could just build from scratch,\n\n55:23.920 --> 55:26.480\n how much work I do and what I work on\n\n55:26.480 --> 55:28.600\n to be as in touch with that as like paleo people\n\n55:28.600 --> 55:30.080\n are trying to get their diets in touch with that.\n\n55:30.080 --> 55:32.200\n And so now I'm just, well, see, this is,\n\n55:32.200 --> 55:34.000\n it's something I made up,\n\n55:34.000 --> 55:36.160\n but now I'm going deep on it.\n\n55:36.160 --> 55:38.080\n And one of my podcast listeners I was talking about\n\n55:38.080 --> 55:39.280\n on the show and I was like,\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:41.400\n well, I get trying to learn about animals and boredom.\n\n55:41.400 --> 55:42.840\n And she sent me this cool article\n\n55:42.840 --> 55:44.560\n from an animal behaviorist journal\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:48.080\n about what we know about human boredom versus animal boredom.\n\n55:48.080 --> 55:49.960\n So trying to figure out that puzzle\n\n55:49.960 --> 55:52.240\n is the wave that's high.\n\n55:52.240 --> 55:54.120\n So I can get through the wave that's low of like,\n\n55:54.120 --> 55:55.680\n I don't know about this pandemic book launch.\n\n55:55.680 --> 55:59.760\n And my research is stumbling a little bit\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:00.600\n because of the pandemic.\n\n56:00.600 --> 56:03.640\n And so I needed a nice, you know, high.\n\n56:03.640 --> 56:05.360\n So there we go, there's a case study.\n\n56:05.360 --> 56:07.480\n Well, it's both a case study\n\n56:07.480 --> 56:09.320\n and a very interesting set of concepts\n\n56:09.320 --> 56:12.280\n because I didn't even realize that it's so simple.\n\n56:12.280 --> 56:14.200\n I'm one of the people\n\n56:14.200 --> 56:18.960\n that has a interesting push and pull dynamic with hunger,\n\n56:18.960 --> 56:21.160\n trying to understand the hunger with myself.\n\n56:21.160 --> 56:24.640\n Like I probably have an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\n56:24.640 --> 56:28.440\n I don't know, but there's probably a perfect,\n\n56:28.440 --> 56:32.760\n that's a nice way to think about diet as action.\n\n56:32.760 --> 56:36.520\n There's probably an optimal diet response\n\n56:36.520 --> 56:40.320\n to the experience that our body's telling us,\n\n56:40.320 --> 56:43.280\n the signal that our body's sending, which is hunger.\n\n56:43.280 --> 56:46.840\n And in that same way, boredom is sending a signal.\n\n56:46.840 --> 56:49.960\n And most of our intellectual activities in this world,\n\n56:49.960 --> 56:51.800\n our creative activities,\n\n56:51.800 --> 56:56.640\n are essentially a response to that signal.\n\n56:56.640 --> 56:59.680\n Yeah, and think about this analogy\n\n56:59.680 --> 57:01.120\n that we have this hunger instinct\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:03.960\n that junk food short circuits, right?\n\n57:03.960 --> 57:06.760\n It's like, oh, we'll satisfy that hyper palatably\n\n57:06.760 --> 57:08.280\n and it doesn't end up well.\n\n57:08.280 --> 57:11.800\n Now think about modern attention engineered,\n\n57:11.800 --> 57:14.560\n digitally mediated entertainment.\n\n57:14.560 --> 57:16.040\n We have this boredom instinct.\n\n57:16.040 --> 57:17.800\n Oh, we can take care of that\n\n57:17.800 --> 57:20.520\n with a hyper palatable alternative.\n\n57:20.520 --> 57:22.280\n Is that gonna lead to a similar problem?\n\n57:22.280 --> 57:23.760\n So I've been fasting a lot lately,\n\n57:23.760 --> 57:27.680\n like I'm doing eating once a day.\n\n57:27.680 --> 57:29.640\n I've been doing that for over a month,\n\n57:29.640 --> 57:33.800\n just eating one meal a day and primarily meat.\n\n57:33.800 --> 57:38.280\n But it's very, fasting has been incredible for me,\n\n57:38.280 --> 57:41.600\n for focus, for wellbeing, for, I don't know,\n\n57:41.600 --> 57:43.040\n just for feeling good, okay?\n\n57:43.040 --> 57:45.680\n We'll put on a chart what makes me feel good.\n\n57:45.680 --> 57:50.680\n And that fasting and eating primarily a meat based diet\n\n57:50.720 --> 57:52.480\n makes me feel really good.\n\n57:52.480 --> 57:57.480\n And so, but that ultimately what fasting did,\n\n57:57.760 --> 57:59.240\n I haven't fasted super long yet,\n\n57:59.240 --> 58:02.080\n like a seven day diet, which I really like to do.\n\n58:02.080 --> 58:05.080\n But even just fasting for a day for 24 hours\n\n58:05.080 --> 58:09.920\n gets you in touch with your, with the signal.\n\n58:09.920 --> 58:10.760\n It's fascinating.\n\n58:10.760 --> 58:12.320\n Like you get to listen to your,\n\n58:12.320 --> 58:15.000\n learn to listen to your body that like,\n\n58:16.240 --> 58:17.680\n it's okay to be hungry.\n\n58:17.680 --> 58:19.720\n It's like a little signal that sends you stuff.\n\n58:19.720 --> 58:24.080\n And then I get to listen to how it responds\n\n58:24.080 --> 58:27.480\n when I put food in my body.\n\n58:27.480 --> 58:30.440\n Like, and I get to like, okay, cool.\n\n58:30.440 --> 58:33.720\n So like food is a thing that pacifies the signal.\n\n58:33.720 --> 58:35.520\n Like it sounds ridiculous, okay?\n\n58:35.520 --> 58:36.360\n And you could do that with.\n\n58:36.360 --> 58:38.280\n And do different types of food.\n\n58:38.280 --> 58:39.120\n It feels different.\n\n58:39.120 --> 58:41.640\n So you learn about what your body wants.\n\n58:41.640 --> 58:44.120\n For some reason fasting,\n\n58:44.120 --> 58:47.320\n it's similar to the deep work, embrace boredom.\n\n58:47.320 --> 58:50.360\n Fasting allowed me to go into mode of listening,\n\n58:50.360 --> 58:53.840\n of trying to understand the signal that I could say,\n\n58:53.840 --> 58:57.840\n I have an unhealthy appreciation of fruit, okay?\n\n58:57.840 --> 58:59.520\n I love apples and cherries.\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:01.400\n Like, I don't know how to moderate them.\n\n59:01.400 --> 59:03.480\n So if you take just same amount of calories,\n\n59:03.480 --> 59:05.920\n I don't know calories matter, but they say calories.\n\n59:05.920 --> 59:10.920\n 2000 calories of cherries versus 2000 calories of steak.\n\n59:11.520 --> 59:13.280\n If I eat 2000 calories of steak,\n\n59:13.280 --> 59:17.160\n maybe just a little bit of like green beans or cauliflower,\n\n59:17.160 --> 59:22.160\n I'm going to feel really good, fulfilled, focused and happy.\n\n59:22.360 --> 59:24.440\n If I eat cherries, I'm going to be,\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:28.400\n I'm going to wake up behind a dumpster crying with like naked\n\n59:28.400 --> 59:29.680\n and like, it's just.\n\n59:29.680 --> 59:30.520\n Pits all around.\n\n59:30.520 --> 59:31.640\n Yeah, with everything.\n\n59:31.640 --> 59:32.480\n Over your face, yeah.\n\n59:32.480 --> 59:36.400\n And it's just like bloated, just not and unhappy.\n\n59:36.400 --> 59:39.720\n And also the mood swings up and down.\n\n59:39.720 --> 59:41.320\n I don't know.\n\n59:41.320 --> 59:44.720\n And I'll be much hungrier the next day.\n\n59:44.720 --> 59:46.240\n Sometimes it takes a couple of days.\n\n59:46.240 --> 59:50.080\n But when I introduce carbs into the system, too many carbs,\n\n59:50.080 --> 59:53.040\n it starts, it's just unhealthy.\n\n59:53.040 --> 59:56.040\n I go into this roller coaster as opposed to a calm boat ride\n\n59:56.040 --> 59:58.560\n along the river in the Amazon or something like that.\n\n59:58.560 --> 1:00:01.600\n And so fasting was the mechanism for me\n\n1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:03.960\n to start listening to the body.\n\n1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:05.960\n I wonder if you can do that same kind of,\n\n1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:07.920\n I guess that's what meditation a little bit is.\n\n1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:10.160\n A little bit, but yeah, listen to boredom.\n\n1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:11.040\n But so two years ago,\n\n1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:13.560\n I had a book out called Digital Minimalism.\n\n1:00:13.560 --> 1:00:16.120\n And one of the things I was recommending that people do\n\n1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:18.320\n is basically a 30 day fast.\n\n1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:20.440\n But from digital personal entertainment,\n\n1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:21.920\n social media, online videos,\n\n1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:26.400\n anything that captures your attention and dispels boredom.\n\n1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:29.520\n And people were thinking like, oh, this is a detox.\n\n1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:30.720\n Like, I just wanna teach your body\n\n1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:32.760\n not to need the distraction, this or that.\n\n1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.320\n But it really wasn't what I was interested in.\n\n1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:37.640\n I wanted there to be space\n\n1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:39.400\n that you could listen to your boredom.\n\n1:00:39.400 --> 1:00:41.080\n Like, okay, I can't just dispel it.\n\n1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:42.520\n I can't just look at the screen\n\n1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:45.120\n and revel in it a little bit and start to listen to it\n\n1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:48.000\n and say, what is this really pushing me towards?\n\n1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.800\n And you take the new stuff, the new technology off the table\n\n1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:52.440\n and sort of ask, what is this?\n\n1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:53.280\n What am I craving?\n\n1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:56.800\n Like, what's the activity equivalent of 2000 calories\n\n1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:59.320\n of meat with a little bit of green beans on the side?\n\n1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.600\n And I had 1700 people go through this experiment,\n\n1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:03.400\n like spend 30 days doing this.\n\n1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:04.280\n And it's hard at first,\n\n1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:06.920\n but then they get used to listening to themselves\n\n1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:07.800\n and sort of seeking out,\n\n1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:09.680\n what is this really pushing me towards?\n\n1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.240\n And it was pushing people towards connection.\n\n1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:13.400\n It was pushing people towards,\n\n1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:15.520\n I just wanna go be around other people.\n\n1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:18.040\n It was pushing people towards high quality\n\n1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:19.280\n leisure activities.\n\n1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:21.640\n Like I wanna go do something that's complicated.\n\n1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:23.200\n And it took weeks sometimes for them\n\n1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.080\n to get in touch with their boredom,\n\n1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:28.720\n but then it completely rewired how they thought about,\n\n1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:30.720\n what do I wanna do with my time outside of work?\n\n1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.000\n And then the idea is when you're done with that,\n\n1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:33.240\n then it was much easier to go back\n\n1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:34.880\n and completely change your digital life\n\n1:01:34.880 --> 1:01:37.360\n because you have alternatives, right?\n\n1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:39.800\n You're not just trying to abstain from things you don't like,\n\n1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.600\n but that's basically a listening to boredom experiment.\n\n1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.000\n Like just be there with the boredom\n\n1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.240\n and see where it drives you\n\n1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.720\n when you don't have the digital Cheez Its.\n\n1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:50.840\n Okay, so if I can't do that,\n\n1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:51.880\n where is it gonna drive me?\n\n1:01:51.880 --> 1:01:53.800\n Well, I guess I kinda wanna go to the library,\n\n1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:54.880\n which came up a lot, by the way,\n\n1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.200\n a lot of people rediscovered the library.\n\n1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:58.040\n With physical books.\n\n1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:00.320\n Physical books, so like you can just go borrow them.\n\n1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:03.040\n And there's like low pressure and you can explore\n\n1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:04.720\n and you bring them home and then you read them\n\n1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:06.480\n and you can like sit by the window and read them\n\n1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:07.520\n and it's nice weather outside.\n\n1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:09.560\n And I used to do that 20 years ago,\n\n1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.800\n they're listening to boredom.\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:12.800\n So can you maybe elaborate a little bit\n\n1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:15.400\n on the different experiences that people had\n\n1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:17.640\n when they quit social media for 30 days?\n\n1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:20.560\n Like if you were to recommend that process,\n\n1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:22.840\n what is ultimately the goal?\n\n1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:24.520\n Yeah, digital minimalism,\n\n1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:27.560\n that's my philosophy for all this tech.\n\n1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:30.520\n And it's working backwards from what's important.\n\n1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:33.000\n So it's you figure out what you're actually all about,\n\n1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:33.960\n like what you wanna do,\n\n1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:35.720\n what you wanna spend your time doing.\n\n1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.480\n And then you can ask, okay,\n\n1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:38.960\n is there a place that tech could amplify\n\n1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:40.000\n or support some of these things?\n\n1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.680\n And that's how you decide what tech to use.\n\n1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:44.120\n And so the process is,\n\n1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:46.320\n let's actually get away from everything,\n\n1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:47.640\n let's be bored for a while,\n\n1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:49.480\n let's really spend a month getting really figuring out\n\n1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:50.880\n what do I actually wanna do?\n\n1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:52.000\n What do I wanna spend my time doing?\n\n1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.640\n What's important to me?\n\n1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:54.520\n What makes me feel good?\n\n1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.360\n And then when you're done,\n\n1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:56.960\n you can bring back in tech very strategically\n\n1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:58.560\n to help those things, right?\n\n1:02:58.560 --> 1:02:59.800\n And that was the goal.\n\n1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:01.680\n That turns out to be much more successful\n\n1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:05.320\n than when people take a abstention only approach.\n\n1:03:05.320 --> 1:03:08.840\n So if you come out your tech life and say,\n\n1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:10.720\n you know, whatever, I look at Instagram too much.\n\n1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:12.880\n Like I don't like how much I'm on Instagram,\n\n1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:13.800\n that's a bad thing.\n\n1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.120\n I wanna reduce this bad thing.\n\n1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:16.320\n So here's my new thing,\n\n1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:18.160\n I'm gonna spend less time looking at Instagram,\n\n1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.680\n much less likely to succeed in the longterm.\n\n1:03:20.680 --> 1:03:23.200\n So we're much less likely at trying to reduce\n\n1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.480\n this sort of amorphous negative\n\n1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:25.840\n because in the moment you're like,\n\n1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:27.280\n yeah, but it's not that bad\n\n1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.200\n and it would be kind of interesting to look at it now.\n\n1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:30.880\n When you're instead controlling behavior\n\n1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:32.720\n because you have a positive that you're aiming towards,\n\n1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:33.720\n it's very powerful for people.\n\n1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:35.920\n Like I want my life to be like this,\n\n1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:39.120\n here's the role that tech plays in that life.\n\n1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:41.240\n The connection to wanting your life to be like that\n\n1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:42.440\n is very, very strong.\n\n1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:43.680\n And then it's much, much easier to say,\n\n1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:45.760\n yeah, like using Instagram is not part of my plan\n\n1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:46.640\n for how I have that life.\n\n1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:47.760\n And I really wanna have that life,\n\n1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.000\n so of course I'm not gonna use Instagram.\n\n1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.760\n So it turns out to be a much more sustainable way\n\n1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.240\n to tame what's going on.\n\n1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:55.320\n So if you quit social media for 30 days,\n\n1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:58.080\n you kinda have to do the work.\n\n1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.320\n You have to do the work.\n\n1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:01.440\n Of thinking like, what am I actually,\n\n1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:04.320\n what makes me happy in terms of these tools\n\n1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:05.600\n that I've previously used\n\n1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:08.880\n and when you try to integrate them back,\n\n1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:10.840\n how can I integrate them to maximize\n\n1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:11.680\n the thing that actually makes me happy?\n\n1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.480\n Yeah, or what makes me happy unrelated to technology?\n\n1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:16.240\n Like what do I actually, what do I want my life to be like?\n\n1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.640\n Well, maybe what I wanna do is be like outside of nature\n\n1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:20.160\n two hours a day and spend a lot more time\n\n1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:21.960\n like helping my community and sacrificing\n\n1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:23.120\n on behalf of my connections\n\n1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:26.440\n and then have some sort of intellectually engaging\n\n1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:28.200\n leisure activity like I'm reading\n\n1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:29.600\n or trying to read the great books\n\n1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:31.640\n and having more calm and seeing the sunset.\n\n1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:34.800\n Like you create this picture and then you go back\n\n1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:36.600\n and say, well, I still need my Facebook group\n\n1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:39.800\n because that's how I keep up with my cycling group.\n\n1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:41.280\n But Twitter is just, you know,\n\n1:04:41.280 --> 1:04:42.800\n toxic, it's not helping any of these things.\n\n1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:43.640\n And well, I'm an artist,\n\n1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:46.280\n so I kinda need Instagram to get inspiration.\n\n1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:48.200\n But if I know that's why I'm using Instagram,\n\n1:04:48.200 --> 1:04:49.960\n I don't need it on my phone, it's just on my computer\n\n1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:51.880\n and I just follow 10 artists and check it once a week.\n\n1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:54.040\n Like you really can start deploying.\n\n1:04:54.040 --> 1:04:55.000\n It was the number one thing\n\n1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.600\n that differentiated in that experiment,\n\n1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.960\n the people who ended up sustainably making changes\n\n1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:02.200\n and getting through the 30 days and those who didn't,\n\n1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:03.920\n was the people who did the experimentation\n\n1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:04.760\n and the reflection.\n\n1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:07.520\n Like let me try to figure out what's positive.\n\n1:05:07.520 --> 1:05:09.200\n They were much more successful than the people\n\n1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.960\n that just said, I'm sick of using my phone so much.\n\n1:05:11.960 --> 1:05:12.920\n So I'm just gonna white knuckle it.\n\n1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:14.120\n Just 30 days will be good for me.\n\n1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:16.560\n I just gotta get away from it or something.\n\n1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:17.640\n It doesn't last.\n\n1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.840\n So you don't use social media currently.\n\n1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:21.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:24.360\n Do you find that a lot of people going through this process\n\n1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:29.360\n will seek to basically arrive at a similar place\n\n1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:30.960\n to not use social media primarily?\n\n1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.280\n About half.\n\n1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.760\n Right, so about half when they went through this exercise,\n\n1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:36.920\n and these aren't quantified numbers.\n\n1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:40.160\n This is just, they sent me reports and yeah.\n\n1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:42.080\n That's pretty good though, 1700?\n\n1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:42.920\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:47.240\n So roughly half probably got rid of social media altogether.\n\n1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:48.280\n Once they did this exercise,\n\n1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:50.160\n they realized these things I care about,\n\n1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:53.640\n I don't, social media's not the tools that's really helping.\n\n1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:55.280\n The other half kept some,\n\n1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.440\n there were some things in their life\n\n1:05:56.440 --> 1:05:59.080\n where some social media was useful.\n\n1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:00.160\n But the key thing is if they knew\n\n1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:02.520\n why they were deploying social media,\n\n1:06:02.520 --> 1:06:04.400\n they could put fences around it.\n\n1:06:04.400 --> 1:06:07.120\n So for example, of those half that kept some social media,\n\n1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.480\n almost none of them kept it on their phone.\n\n1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:10.320\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:12.120\n Yeah, you can't optimize if you don't know\n\n1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:13.640\n what the function you're trying to optimize.\n\n1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:14.680\n So it's like this huge hack.\n\n1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:16.960\n Like once you know this is why I'm using Twitter,\n\n1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:19.200\n then you can have a lot of rules about how you use Twitter.\n\n1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:21.680\n And suddenly you take this cost benefit ratio\n\n1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:24.160\n and it goes like way from the company's advantage\n\n1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:25.840\n and then way over towards your advantage.\n\n1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:26.960\n It's kind of fascinating\n\n1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:29.320\n because I've been torn with social media,\n\n1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:30.600\n but I did this kind of process.\n\n1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.280\n I haven't actually done it for 30 days,\n\n1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:33.720\n which I probably should.\n\n1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:36.120\n I'll do it for like a week at a time and regularly\n\n1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:41.120\n and thinking what kind of approach to Twitter works for me.\n\n1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:46.280\n I'm distinctly aware of the fact\n\n1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:51.200\n that I really enjoy posting once or twice a day.\n\n1:06:51.200 --> 1:06:54.600\n And at that time checking from the previous post,\n\n1:06:54.600 --> 1:06:59.600\n it makes me feel even when there's like negative comments,\n\n1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:01.360\n they go right past me.\n\n1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:03.520\n And when there's positive comments, it makes you smile.\n\n1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:06.160\n I feel like love and connection with people,\n\n1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:07.520\n especially with people I know,\n\n1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:09.040\n but even just in general, it's like,\n\n1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:12.200\n it makes me feel like the world is full of awesome people.\n\n1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:15.800\n Okay, when you increase that from checking from two to like,\n\n1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:17.480\n I don't know what the threshold is for me,\n\n1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:19.920\n but probably like five or six per day,\n\n1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:21.960\n it starts going to anxiety world.\n\n1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:25.640\n Like where negative comments will actually stick\n\n1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:30.640\n to me mentally and positive comments will feel more shallow.\n\n1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:34.680\n It's kind of fascinating.\n\n1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:39.680\n So I've been trying to, there's been long stretches of time,\n\n1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:44.640\n I think December and January where I did just post\n\n1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.360\n and check, post and check.\n\n1:07:46.360 --> 1:07:49.040\n That makes me really happy.\n\n1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:52.520\n Most of 2020 I did that, it made me really happy.\n\n1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:56.040\n Recently I started like, I'll go,\n\n1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:57.960\n you go right back in like a drug addict,\n\n1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.680\n where you check it like, I don't know what that number is,\n\n1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:01.640\n but that number is high.\n\n1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:03.840\n Not good, you don't come out happy.\n\n1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:06.000\n No one comes out of a day full of Twitter\n\n1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.280\n celebrating humanity.\n\n1:08:07.280 --> 1:08:08.720\n And it's not even,\n\n1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:11.280\n cause I'm very fortunate to have a lot of just\n\n1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:12.880\n positivity in the Twitter,\n\n1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:16.160\n but there's just a general anxiety.\n\n1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:19.840\n I wouldn't even say it's,\n\n1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:21.400\n it's probably the thing that you're talking about\n\n1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:22.640\n with the contact switching.\n\n1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.800\n It's almost like an exhaustion.\n\n1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:27.920\n I wouldn't even say it's like a negative feeling.\n\n1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:29.520\n It's almost just an exhaustion\n\n1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.960\n to where I'm not creating anything beautiful in my life,\n\n1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:33.800\n just exhausted.\n\n1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.240\n Like an existential exhaustion.\n\n1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:36.920\n Existential exhaustion.\n\n1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.560\n But I wonder, do you think it's possible to use\n\n1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:42.240\n from the people you've seen from yourself\n\n1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.560\n to use social media in the way I'm describing moderation?\n\n1:08:45.560 --> 1:08:48.040\n Or is it always going to become?\n\n1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:49.240\n When people do this exercise,\n\n1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:52.320\n you get lots of configurations.\n\n1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:56.080\n So for people that have a public presence, for example,\n\n1:08:56.080 --> 1:08:58.840\n like what you're doing is not that unusual.\n\n1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:02.200\n Okay, I post one thing a day and my audience likes it\n\n1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:04.160\n and that's kind of it.\n\n1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:05.760\n But you've thought through like, okay,\n\n1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:06.960\n this supports something I value,\n\n1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:09.440\n which is like having a sort of informal connection\n\n1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.040\n with my audience and being exposed to some sort of\n\n1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:15.640\n positive randomness.\n\n1:09:15.640 --> 1:09:18.400\n Okay, then you could say if that's my goal,\n\n1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:19.240\n what's the right way to do it?\n\n1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:20.760\n Well, I don't need to be on Twitter on my phone all day.\n\n1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:22.680\n Maybe what I do is every day at five,\n\n1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.200\n I do my post and check on the day.\n\n1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.800\n So I have a writer friend, Ryan Holiday,\n\n1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:30.480\n who writes about the Stoics a lot.\n\n1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:32.080\n And he has this similar strategy.\n\n1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:36.480\n He posts one quote every day usually from a famous Stoic\n\n1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:37.640\n and sometimes from a contemporary figure.\n\n1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:38.480\n And that's just what he does.\n\n1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:41.280\n He just posts it and it's a very positive thing.\n\n1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:42.560\n Like his readers really love it\n\n1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:44.320\n because it's just like a dose of inspiration.\n\n1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:46.000\n He doesn't spend time.\n\n1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:48.760\n He's never interacting with anyone on social media, right?\n\n1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:51.000\n But that's an example of I figured out\n\n1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:51.840\n what's important to me,\n\n1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.040\n what's the best way to use tools to amplify it.\n\n1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:56.280\n And then you get advantages out of the tools.\n\n1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:57.560\n So I like what you're doing.\n\n1:09:57.560 --> 1:09:59.280\n I looked you up, I looked up your Twitter feed\n\n1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:00.520\n before I came over here.\n\n1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:02.520\n I was curious, you're not on there a lot.\n\n1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:04.000\n I don't see you yelling at people.\n\n1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.600\n Now, do you think social media as a medium\n\n1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:09.120\n changed the cultural standards?\n\n1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.920\n And I mean it in a, have you read Neil Postman at all?\n\n1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.040\n Have you read like a Amusing Ourselves to Death?\n\n1:10:14.040 --> 1:10:16.040\n He was a social critic, technology critic\n\n1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.760\n and wrote a lot about sort of technological determinism.\n\n1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:22.440\n So the ways, which is a really influential idea\n\n1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:23.280\n to a lot of my work,\n\n1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:24.600\n which is actually a little out of fashion\n\n1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:25.560\n right now in academia.\n\n1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:28.120\n But the ways that the properties\n\n1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:31.160\n and presence of technologies change things about humans\n\n1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:32.600\n in a way that's not really intended\n\n1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:33.880\n or planned by the humans themselves.\n\n1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.080\n And that book is all about\n\n1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:38.040\n how different communication medium,\n\n1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:39.320\n like fundamentally just changed the way\n\n1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:42.080\n the human brain understands and operates.\n\n1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.400\n And so he sort of gets into the,\n\n1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:45.680\n what happened when the printed word was widespread\n\n1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:47.240\n and how television changed it.\n\n1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.840\n And this was all pre social media.\n\n1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.200\n But this is one of these ideas I'm having\n\n1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:52.480\n is like what's the degree to which,\n\n1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.000\n and I get into it sometimes on my show,\n\n1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:54.840\n I get into a little bit,\n\n1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:58.040\n like the degree to which like Twitter in particular\n\n1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:00.160\n just changed the way that people conceptualized\n\n1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:03.880\n what for example, debate and discussion was.\n\n1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:06.080\n Like it introduced a rhetorical dunk culture\n\n1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:08.120\n where it's sort of more about tribes\n\n1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:10.240\n not giving ground to other tribes.\n\n1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.000\n And it's like, it's a complete,\n\n1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.760\n there's different places and times\n\n1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:17.800\n when that type of discussion was thought of differently.\n\n1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:19.200\n Well, yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:21.200\n But I tend to believe, I don't know what you think,\n\n1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:23.240\n that there's the technological solutions.\n\n1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:27.520\n Like there's literally different features in Twitter\n\n1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:29.200\n that could completely reverse that.\n\n1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.280\n There's so much power in the different choices that are made.\n\n1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.200\n And it could still be highly engaging\n\n1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:37.360\n and have very different effects.\n\n1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.240\n Perhaps more negative or hopefully more positive.\n\n1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.360\n Yeah, so I'm trying to pull these two things apart.\n\n1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:45.200\n So there's these two ways social media,\n\n1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.600\n let's say could change the experience\n\n1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:49.120\n of reading a major newspaper today.\n\n1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.960\n One could be a little bit more economic, right?\n\n1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.360\n So the internet made it cheaper to get news.\n\n1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:55.360\n The newspapers had to retreat to a paywall model\n\n1:11:55.360 --> 1:11:56.960\n because it was the only way they were gonna survive.\n\n1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.240\n But once you're in a paywall model,\n\n1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:01.360\n then what you really wanna do is make your tribe,\n\n1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:03.760\n which is within the paywall, very, very happy with you.\n\n1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:04.880\n So you wanna work to them.\n\n1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:07.480\n But then there's the sort of determinist point of view,\n\n1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:10.280\n which is the properties of Twitter, which were arbitrary.\n\n1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:13.840\n Jack and Evan just, whatever, let's just do it this way.\n\n1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.720\n Influenced the very way that people now understand\n\n1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:16.760\n and think about the world.\n\n1:12:16.760 --> 1:12:19.520\n So the one influenced the other, I think.\n\n1:12:19.520 --> 1:12:21.720\n They kind of started adjusting together.\n\n1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:25.000\n I did this thing, I mean, I'm trying to understand this.\n\n1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:30.000\n Part of the, I've been playing with the entrepreneurial idea.\n\n1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:34.280\n That's a very particular dream I've had of a startup.\n\n1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.200\n That this is a longer term thing,\n\n1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:39.520\n it has to do with artificial intelligence.\n\n1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:43.000\n But more and more, it seems like there's some trajectory\n\n1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.400\n through creating social media type of technologies.\n\n1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:49.520\n Very different than what people are thinking I'm doing.\n\n1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:54.520\n But it's a kind of challenge to the way the Twitter is done.\n\n1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:58.720\n But it's not obvious what the best mechanisms are\n\n1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:01.840\n to still make an exceptionally engaging platform.\n\n1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:03.960\n My clubhouse is very engaging.\n\n1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.520\n And not have any other negative effects.\n\n1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.880\n For example, there's Chrome extensions\n\n1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:13.600\n that allow you to turn off all likes and dislikes\n\n1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:14.960\n and all of that from Twitter.\n\n1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:18.200\n So all you're seeing is just the content.\n\n1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:21.480\n On Twitter, that to me creates,\n\n1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:23.560\n that's not a compelling experience at all.\n\n1:13:23.560 --> 1:13:26.880\n Because I still need, I would argue,\n\n1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:28.400\n I still need the likes to know\n\n1:13:28.400 --> 1:13:30.400\n what's a tweet worth reading.\n\n1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:32.160\n Because I don't only have a limited amount of time,\n\n1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.000\n so I need to know what's valuable.\n\n1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:36.920\n It's like great Yelp reviews on tweets or something.\n\n1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.600\n But I've turned off on, for example,\n\n1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:45.600\n on my account on YouTube, I wrote a Chrome extension\n\n1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:50.400\n that turns off all likes and dislikes and just views.\n\n1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.000\n I don't know how many views the video gets and so on.\n\n1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:53.840\n Unless it's on my phone.\n\n1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:55.640\n Did you take off the recommendations?\n\n1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:58.480\n No, no.\n\n1:13:58.480 --> 1:13:59.480\n On YouTube, some people,\n\n1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:02.080\n distraction for YouTube is a big one for people.\n\n1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:04.040\n No, I'm not worried about the distraction\n\n1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:06.880\n because I'm able to control myself on YouTube.\n\n1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:07.840\n You don't rabbit hole.\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.000\n No, I don't rabbit hole.\n\n1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.160\n So you have to know your demons or your addictions\n\n1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:12.000\n or whatever.\n\n1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:13.360\n On YouTube, I'm okay.\n\n1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:14.640\n I don't keep clicking.\n\n1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:19.320\n The negative feelings come from seeing the views\n\n1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:22.080\n on stuff you've created.\n\n1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:24.080\n Oh, so you don't want to see your views.\n\n1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:24.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:26.760\n So I'm just speaking to the things\n\n1:14:26.760 --> 1:14:29.640\n that I'm aware of of myself that are helpful\n\n1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:31.920\n and things that are not helpful emotionally.\n\n1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:34.520\n And I feel like there should be,\n\n1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:37.000\n we need to create actually tooling for ourselves.\n\n1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.800\n That's not me with JavaScript,\n\n1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:42.280\n but anybody is able to create,\n\n1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:45.040\n sort of control the experience that they have.\n\n1:14:45.040 --> 1:14:45.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:48.880\n Well, so my big unified theory on social media\n\n1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.440\n is I'm very bearish on the big platforms\n\n1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:53.760\n having a long future.\n\n1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:54.600\n You are.\n\n1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:57.920\n I think the moment of three or four major platforms\n\n1:14:57.920 --> 1:15:01.200\n is not gonna last, right?\n\n1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:02.240\n So I don't know.\n\n1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:03.080\n Okay.\n\n1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:03.920\n This is just perspective, right?\n\n1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:07.000\n So you can start shorting these stocks on my,\n\n1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:07.840\n don't tell.\n\n1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:08.680\n It's not financial advice.\n\n1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:09.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:09.520 --> 1:15:10.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:11.200\n Don't do it Robinhood.\n\n1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:12.880\n So here's, I think the big mistake\n\n1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:17.200\n the major platforms made as when they took out\n\n1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:19.400\n the network effect advantage, right?\n\n1:15:19.400 --> 1:15:20.960\n So the original pitch,\n\n1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:23.160\n especially if something like Facebook or Instagram\n\n1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:26.440\n was the people you know are on here, right?\n\n1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:28.560\n So like what you use this for is you can connect to people\n\n1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:29.760\n that you already know.\n\n1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:31.680\n This is what makes the network useful.\n\n1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:34.760\n So therefore the value of our network grows quadratically\n\n1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:35.800\n with the number of users.\n\n1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:37.800\n And therefore it's such a headstart\n\n1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:40.360\n that there's no way that someone else can catch up.\n\n1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:42.680\n But when they shifted and when Facebook took the lead\n\n1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:45.720\n of say we're gonna shift towards a newsfeed model,\n\n1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:48.480\n they basically said we're going to try to in the moment\n\n1:15:48.480 --> 1:15:50.280\n get more data and get more likes.\n\n1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:51.320\n Like what we're gonna go towards\n\n1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:54.320\n is actually just seeing interesting stuff.\n\n1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:55.400\n Like seeing different information.\n\n1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:58.280\n So people took this social internet impulse\n\n1:15:58.280 --> 1:15:59.720\n to connect to people digitally,\n\n1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:01.920\n to other tools like group text messages\n\n1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:03.160\n and WhatsApp and stuff like this, right?\n\n1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:04.400\n So you don't think about these tools\n\n1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:06.480\n as oh, this is where I connect with people.\n\n1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.160\n Once it's just a feed that's kind of interesting,\n\n1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:10.800\n now you're competing with everything else\n\n1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:13.480\n that can produce interesting content that's diverting.\n\n1:16:13.480 --> 1:16:16.320\n And I think that is a much fiercer competition\n\n1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.320\n because now for example, you're going up against podcasts,\n\n1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:19.160\n right?\n\n1:16:19.160 --> 1:16:20.720\n I mean like, okay, I guess the Twitter feed\n\n1:16:20.720 --> 1:16:22.920\n is interesting right now,\n\n1:16:22.920 --> 1:16:24.360\n but also a podcast is interesting\n\n1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:25.600\n or something else could be interesting too.\n\n1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:27.320\n I think it's a much fiercer competition\n\n1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.920\n when there's no more network effects, right?\n\n1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:32.240\n And so my sense is we're gonna see a fragmentation\n\n1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.760\n into what I call long tail social media,\n\n1:16:34.760 --> 1:16:38.480\n where if I don't need everyone I know to be on a platform,\n\n1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.880\n then why not have three or four bespoke platforms I use\n\n1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:44.880\n where it's a thousand people and we're all interested\n\n1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:47.880\n in whatever, AI or comedy.\n\n1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:50.080\n And we've perfected this interface\n\n1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:52.080\n and maybe it's like Clubhouse, it's audio or something.\n\n1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:54.240\n And we all pay $2 so that we don't have to worry\n\n1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:55.800\n about attention harvesting.\n\n1:16:55.800 --> 1:16:57.760\n And that's gonna be wildly more entertaining.\n\n1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.600\n Like, I mean, I'm thinking about comedians on Twitter.\n\n1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:04.080\n It's not the best internet possible format\n\n1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:06.400\n for them expressing themselves and being interesting.\n\n1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:08.080\n That you have all these comedians that are trying to like,\n\n1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:10.040\n well, I can do like little clips and little whatever.\n\n1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:13.000\n Like, I don't know if there was a long tail social media.\n\n1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:14.440\n I mean, it's really, this is where the comedians are\n\n1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:16.480\n and there's podcasts and the comedians are on podcasts now.\n\n1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:19.440\n So this is my thought is that there's really no,\n\n1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.200\n there's really no strong advantage\n\n1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:25.920\n to having one large platform that everyone is on.\n\n1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:27.240\n If all you're getting from it is,\n\n1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.200\n I now have different options for diversion\n\n1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:31.200\n and like uplifting aspirational\n\n1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.320\n or whatever types of entertainment,\n\n1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:34.560\n that whole thing could fragment.\n\n1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:36.120\n And I think the glue that was holding together\n\n1:17:36.120 --> 1:17:36.960\n was network effects.\n\n1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:38.680\n I don't think they realized that when network effects\n\n1:17:38.680 --> 1:17:40.040\n have been destabilized,\n\n1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:41.960\n they don't have the centrifugal force anymore\n\n1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.360\n and they're spinning faster and faster.\n\n1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:46.680\n But is a Twitter feed really that much more interesting\n\n1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:48.120\n than all of these streaming services?\n\n1:17:48.120 --> 1:17:49.720\n Is it really that much more interesting\n\n1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:52.360\n than Clubhouse, is it that much more interesting\n\n1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:54.000\n than podcast?\n\n1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.760\n I feel like they don't realize\n\n1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.480\n how unstable their ground actually is.\n\n1:17:57.480 --> 1:17:58.440\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n1:17:58.440 --> 1:18:03.440\n But the thing that makes Twitter and Facebook work,\n\n1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:07.120\n I mean, the newsfeed, you're exactly right.\n\n1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:08.840\n Like you can just duplicate the news.\n\n1:18:08.840 --> 1:18:12.800\n Like if it's not the social network and it's the newsfeed,\n\n1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:15.240\n then why not have multiple different feeds\n\n1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.520\n that are more, that are better at satisfying.\n\n1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:20.600\n There's a dopamine gamification that they've figured out.\n\n1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:21.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:24.880\n And so you have to, whatever you create,\n\n1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:27.360\n you have to at least provide some pleasure\n\n1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:29.680\n in that same gamification kind of way.\n\n1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:32.200\n It doesn't have to have to do with scale\n\n1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:33.280\n of large social networks.\n\n1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:36.160\n But I mean, I guess you're implying that\n\n1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:39.520\n you should be able to design that kind of mechanism\n\n1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:40.360\n in other forms.\n\n1:18:40.360 --> 1:18:42.640\n Or people are turning on that gamification.\n\n1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:44.520\n I mean, so people are getting wise to it\n\n1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.280\n and are getting uncomfortable about it, right?\n\n1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:49.040\n So if I'm offering something, these exist out here.\n\n1:18:49.040 --> 1:18:49.880\n Like sugar.\n\n1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:50.720\n People realize sugar's bad for you.\n\n1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:51.560\n Yeah, sugar's great.\n\n1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:52.400\n They're gonna stop eating it.\n\n1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:53.240\n Yeah, drinking a lot's great too,\n\n1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:56.080\n but also after a while you realize there's problems.\n\n1:18:56.080 --> 1:18:58.120\n So some of the long tail social media networks\n\n1:18:58.120 --> 1:18:59.800\n that are out there that I've looked at,\n\n1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:02.880\n they offer usually like a deeper sense of connection.\n\n1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:04.920\n Like it's usually interesting people\n\n1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:06.160\n that you share some affinity\n\n1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.160\n and you have these carefully cultivated.\n\n1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:09.920\n I wrote this New Yorker piece a couple of years ago\n\n1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:11.560\n about the indie social media movement\n\n1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:14.920\n that really got into some of these different technologies.\n\n1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:17.000\n But I think the technologies are a distraction.\n\n1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:20.480\n We focus too much on Macedon versus whatever.\n\n1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:21.800\n Like forget, or Discord.\n\n1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:23.480\n Like actually let's forget the protocols right now.\n\n1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:26.040\n It's the idea of, okay.\n\n1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:28.520\n And there's a lot of these long tail social media groups,\n\n1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:29.560\n what people are getting out of it,\n\n1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:32.920\n which I think can outweigh the dopamine gamification\n\n1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:35.160\n is strong connection and motivation.\n\n1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:36.960\n Like you're in a group with other guys\n\n1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:39.640\n that are all trying to be better dads\n\n1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:40.480\n or something like this.\n\n1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:42.680\n And you talk to them on a regular basis\n\n1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:43.720\n and you're sharing your stories\n\n1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:45.720\n and there's interesting talks.\n\n1:19:45.720 --> 1:19:47.440\n And that's a powerful thing too.\n\n1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:49.800\n One interesting thing about scale of Twitter\n\n1:19:49.800 --> 1:19:53.200\n is you have these viral spread of information.\n\n1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:57.040\n So sort of Twitter has become a newsmaker in itself.\n\n1:19:57.040 --> 1:19:58.560\n Yeah, I think it's a problem.\n\n1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:01.080\n Well, yes, but I wonder what replaces that\n\n1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:03.520\n because then you immediately.\n\n1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:04.360\n Reporting?\n\n1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:05.200\n Well, no.\n\n1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.320\n Reporters have to do some work again, I don't know.\n\n1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.720\n The problem with reporters and journalism\n\n1:20:09.720 --> 1:20:12.360\n is that they're intermediary.\n\n1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:14.080\n They have control.\n\n1:20:14.080 --> 1:20:15.960\n I mean, this is the problem in Russia currently\n\n1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:20.960\n is that it creates a shield between the people and the news.\n\n1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:25.080\n The interesting thing and the powerful thing about Twitter\n\n1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:28.040\n is that the news originates from the individual\n\n1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:29.000\n that's creating the news.\n\n1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.200\n Like you have the former president of the United States\n\n1:20:33.200 --> 1:20:34.880\n on Twitter creating news.\n\n1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:36.760\n You have Elon Musk creating news.\n\n1:20:36.760 --> 1:20:39.560\n You have people announcing stuff on Twitter\n\n1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:41.440\n as opposed to talking to a journalist.\n\n1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:44.000\n And that feels much more genuine\n\n1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.320\n and it feels very powerful,\n\n1:20:48.320 --> 1:20:49.960\n but actually coming to realize\n\n1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:53.040\n it doesn't need the social network.\n\n1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:54.680\n You can just put that announcement\n\n1:20:54.680 --> 1:20:56.000\n on a YouTube type thing.\n\n1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:56.840\n This is what I'm thinking.\n\n1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:58.280\n Right, so this is my point about that\n\n1:20:58.280 --> 1:20:59.680\n because that's right.\n\n1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:01.880\n The democratizing power of the internet is fantastic.\n\n1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:03.680\n I mean, I'm an old school internet nerd,\n\n1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:06.440\n a guy that was telemeting in the servers\n\n1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:08.720\n and gophering before the World Wide Web was around, right?\n\n1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:10.120\n So I'm a huge internet booster.\n\n1:21:10.120 --> 1:21:12.320\n And that's one of its big power.\n\n1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:14.400\n But when you put everything on Twitter,\n\n1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.640\n I think the fact that you've taken,\n\n1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:18.400\n you homogenized everything, right?\n\n1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:20.200\n So everything looks the same,\n\n1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.760\n moves with the same low friction is very difficult.\n\n1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:25.320\n You have no what I call distributed curation, right?\n\n1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:27.080\n The only curation that really happens,\n\n1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:29.560\n there's a little bit with likes and also the algorithm.\n\n1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:33.760\n But if you look back to pre web 2.0 or early web 2.0,\n\n1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:34.760\n when a lot of this was happening,\n\n1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:37.480\n let's say on blogs where people own their own servers\n\n1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:39.240\n and you had your different blogs,\n\n1:21:39.240 --> 1:21:41.400\n there was this distributed curation that happened\n\n1:21:41.400 --> 1:21:45.400\n where in order for your blog to get on people's radar\n\n1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:47.600\n and this had nothing to do with any gatekeepers\n\n1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:51.080\n or legacy media, it was over time you got more links\n\n1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:52.080\n and people respected you\n\n1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:53.520\n and you would hear about this blog over here\n\n1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.320\n and there's this whole distributed curation\n\n1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.800\n and filtering going on.\n\n1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:00.080\n So if you think like the 2004 presidential election,\n\n1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:02.280\n most of the information people are getting from the internet\n\n1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:05.840\n was one of the first big internet news driven elections\n\n1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:09.480\n was from, you had like the daily costs and drudge,\n\n1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:11.080\n but there was like blogs that were out there\n\n1:22:11.080 --> 1:22:13.560\n and this was back, Ezra Klein was just running a blog\n\n1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:16.360\n out of his dorm room at this point, right?\n\n1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:20.800\n And you would in a distributed fashion gain credibility\n\n1:22:20.800 --> 1:22:22.680\n because okay, people have paid,\n\n1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.160\n it's very hard to get people to pay attention to your blog,\n\n1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:26.560\n they're paying attention, they get linked to this kid Ezra\n\n1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:28.160\n or whatever, it seems to be really sharp\n\n1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:29.840\n and now people are noticing it\n\n1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:32.240\n and now you have a distributed curation\n\n1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:34.200\n that solves a lot of the problems we see\n\n1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.200\n when you have a completely homogenized low friction\n\n1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:38.400\n environment like friction where, I mean Twitter,\n\n1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:41.240\n where any random conspiracy theory or whatever\n\n1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:44.720\n that people like can just shoot through and spread,\n\n1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:46.560\n whereas if you're starting a blog\n\n1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:49.640\n to try to push QAnon or something like that,\n\n1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:51.560\n it's probably gonna be a really weird looking blog\n\n1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:52.520\n and you're gonna have a hard time,\n\n1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:55.680\n like it's just never gonna show up on people's radar, right?\n\n1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:58.800\n So everything you've said up until the very last statement,\n\n1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:01.000\n I would agree with.\n\n1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.400\n This is a topic I don't know a ton about, I guess, QAnon.\n\n1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:07.240\n There's, I think, I'll forget QAnon.\n\n1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:08.080\n Yeah, no, we can.\n\n1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:10.040\n But QAnon is, QAnon could be that,\n\n1:23:10.040 --> 1:23:12.000\n I also don't know, I should know more,\n\n1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.720\n I apologize, I don't know more.\n\n1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:17.280\n I mean, that's a power and the downside,\n\n1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:21.720\n you can have, I mean, Hitler could have a blog today\n\n1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:24.240\n and you would have potentially a very large following\n\n1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:28.280\n if he's charismatic, if he's as good with words,\n\n1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:29.960\n is able to express the ideas,\n\n1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:32.040\n whatever maybe he's able to channel,\n\n1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:33.720\n the frustration, the anger that people have\n\n1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:34.640\n about a certain thing.\n\n1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:37.360\n And so I think that's the power of blogs,\n\n1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:39.760\n but it's also the limitation, but that doesn't,\n\n1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:40.600\n we're not trying to solve that.\n\n1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:41.920\n You can't solve that, yeah.\n\n1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:45.040\n The fundamental problem you're saying is not the problem.\n\n1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:48.160\n Your thesis is that there's nothing special\n\n1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:51.080\n about large scale social networks\n\n1:23:51.080 --> 1:23:53.600\n that guarantees that they will keep existing.\n\n1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:55.040\n And it's important to remember\n\n1:23:55.040 --> 1:23:58.280\n for a lot of the older generation of internet activists\n\n1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:01.280\n or the people who are very pro internet in the early days,\n\n1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:03.960\n they were completely flabbergasted\n\n1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:05.600\n by the rise of these platforms.\n\n1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:08.600\n Say, why would you take the internet\n\n1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.000\n and then build your own version of the internet\n\n1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.640\n where you own all the servers?\n\n1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:14.520\n And we built this whole distributed,\n\n1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:16.600\n the whole thing, we had open protocols.\n\n1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:18.640\n Everyone anywhere in the world could use the same protocols.\n\n1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:20.000\n Your machine can talk to any other machine.\n\n1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.320\n It's the most democratic communication system\n\n1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:24.280\n that's ever been built.\n\n1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:25.560\n And then these companies came along and said,\n\n1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:26.600\n we're gonna build our own,\n\n1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:27.520\n we'll just own all the servers\n\n1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:29.160\n and put them in buildings that we own.\n\n1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:31.000\n And the internet will just be the first mile\n\n1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.480\n that gets you into our private internet\n\n1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:33.800\n where we owned the whole thing.\n\n1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:37.920\n It went completely against the entire motivation\n\n1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:39.160\n of the internet was like, yes,\n\n1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.320\n it's not gonna be one person owns all the servers\n\n1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:42.280\n and you pay to access them.\n\n1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:43.880\n It's any one server that they own\n\n1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:45.120\n could talk to anyone else's server\n\n1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:48.440\n because we all agree on a standard set of protocols.\n\n1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:51.720\n And so the old guard of pro internet people\n\n1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:54.000\n never understood this move towards\n\n1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.600\n let's build private versions of the internet.\n\n1:24:57.680 --> 1:24:59.080\n We'll build three or four private internets\n\n1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:00.120\n and that's what we'll all use.\n\n1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:01.760\n It was the opposite basically.\n\n1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:03.400\n Well, it's funny enough, I don't know if you follow,\n\n1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.600\n but Jack Dorsey is also as a proponent\n\n1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:11.600\n and is helping to fund, create fully distributed\n\n1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.000\n versions of Twitter, essentially,\n\n1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.960\n I think that would potentially destroy Twitter.\n\n1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:18.520\n But I think there might be financial,\n\n1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:21.920\n like business cases to be made there, I'm not sure.\n\n1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:23.680\n But that seems to be another alternative\n\n1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:28.680\n as opposed to creating a bunch of like the long tail,\n\n1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:31.520\n creating like the ultimate long tail\n\n1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:33.240\n of like fully distributed.\n\n1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:35.080\n Yeah, which is what the internet is.\n\n1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:36.280\n But that's sort of my long,\n\n1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:37.840\n when I'm thinking about long tail social media,\n\n1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:40.960\n I'm thinking it's like the tech's not so important.\n\n1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:42.680\n Like there's groups out there, right?\n\n1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:45.720\n I know where the tech they use to actually implement\n\n1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:47.640\n their digital only social group, whatever,\n\n1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:50.000\n they might use Slack, they might use some combination\n\n1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:51.040\n of Zoom or it doesn't matter.\n\n1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:52.720\n I think in the tech world,\n\n1:25:52.720 --> 1:25:54.800\n we wanna build the beautiful protocol\n\n1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:56.080\n that okay, everyone's gonna use\n\n1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:58.640\n as just a federated server protocol\n\n1:25:58.640 --> 1:25:59.840\n in which we've worked out X, Y, and Z,\n\n1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:00.720\n and no one understands it\n\n1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:02.280\n because then the engineers need it all to make,\n\n1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.480\n I get it because I'm a nerd like this,\n\n1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:05.720\n like, okay, every standard has to fit with everything else\n\n1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:07.400\n and no one understands what's going on.\n\n1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:10.520\n Meanwhile, you have this group of bike enthusiasts\n\n1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:12.360\n that are like, yeah, we'll just jump on to Zoom\n\n1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.240\n and have some Slack and put up a blog.\n\n1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:15.680\n The tech doesn't really matter.\n\n1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:17.640\n Like we built a world with our own curation,\n\n1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:21.960\n our own rules, our own sort of social ecosystem\n\n1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:23.400\n that's generating a lot of value.\n\n1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:24.880\n I mean, I don't know if it'll happen.\n\n1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:27.280\n There's a lot of money at stake with obviously these large,\n\n1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:29.480\n but I just think they're more,\n\n1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:30.840\n they're so, I mean, look how quickly\n\n1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:33.400\n Americans left Facebook, right?\n\n1:26:33.400 --> 1:26:35.560\n I mean, Facebook was savvy to buy other properties\n\n1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:36.720\n and to diversify, right?\n\n1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:37.880\n But how quick did that take\n\n1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:40.800\n for just standard Facebook news feed?\n\n1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:42.960\n Everyone under the age of something were using it\n\n1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.520\n and no one under a certain age is using it now.\n\n1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:45.360\n It took like four years.\n\n1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:47.520\n I mean, this stuff is really.\n\n1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:50.920\n I believe people can leave Facebook overnight.\n\n1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:51.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:54.480\n Like I think Facebook hasn't actually messed up\n\n1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:57.920\n like enough to, there's two things.\n\n1:26:57.920 --> 1:26:58.800\n They haven't messed up enough\n\n1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:00.600\n for people to really leave aggressively\n\n1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.880\n and there's no good alternative for them to leave.\n\n1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:06.200\n I think if good alternatives pop up,\n\n1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:07.600\n it would just immediately happen.\n\n1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:10.280\n The stuff is a lot more culturally fragile, I think.\n\n1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:11.440\n I mean, Twitter's having a moment\n\n1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:13.200\n because it was feeding a certain type of,\n\n1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:14.240\n I mean, there's a lot of anxieties\n\n1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:16.480\n that was in the sort of political sphere anyways\n\n1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:19.080\n that Twitter was working with,\n\n1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:21.680\n but its moment could go to as well.\n\n1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:23.440\n I mean, it's a really arbitrary thing.\n\n1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:24.920\n Short little things.\n\n1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:27.480\n I read a Wired article about this earlier in the pandemic.\n\n1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.560\n This is crazy that the way\n\n1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.400\n that we're trying to communicate information\n\n1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:34.120\n about the pandemic is all these weird arbitrary rules\n\n1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:37.120\n where people are screenshotting pictures of articles\n\n1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:38.360\n that are part of a tweet thread\n\n1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:40.960\n where you say one slash in under it.\n\n1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:43.120\n We have the technology guys\n\n1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:47.120\n to really clearly convey long form information to people.\n\n1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:48.400\n Why do we have these?\n\n1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:50.440\n And I know this because it's the gamified dopamine hits,\n\n1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:52.320\n but what a weird medium.\n\n1:27:52.320 --> 1:27:55.440\n There's no reason for us to have to have these threads\n\n1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:57.840\n that you have to find and pin with your screenshot.\n\n1:27:57.840 --> 1:27:58.920\n I mean, we have technology\n\n1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:00.480\n to communicate better using the internet.\n\n1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:05.120\n I mean, why are epidemiologists having to do tweet threads?\n\n1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:06.960\n Because there's mechanisms of publishing\n\n1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:08.680\n that make it easier on Twitter.\n\n1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:10.800\n I mean, we're evolving as a species\n\n1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:12.880\n and the internet is a very fresh thing.\n\n1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:16.120\n And so it's kind of interesting to think\n\n1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:18.400\n that as opposed to Twitter,\n\n1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:20.280\n this is what Jack also complains about\n\n1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:23.160\n is Twitter's not innovating fast enough.\n\n1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.840\n And so it's almost like the people are innovating\n\n1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:30.360\n and thinking about their productive life faster\n\n1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.680\n than the platforms on which they operate can catch up.\n\n1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.480\n And so at the point the gap grows sufficiently,\n\n1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:38.520\n they'll jump.\n\n1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.400\n A few people, a few innovative folks\n\n1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:42.600\n will just create an alternative\n\n1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:47.600\n and perhaps distributed perhaps just many little silos\n\n1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.040\n and then people will jump\n\n1:28:49.040 --> 1:28:50.600\n and then we'll just continue this kind of way.\n\n1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:52.360\n Yeah, but see, I think like Substack, for example,\n\n1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:53.640\n what they're gonna pull out of Twitter,\n\n1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:56.440\n among other things, is the audience that was,\n\n1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:58.920\n let's say, like slightly left of center,\n\n1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:03.080\n but slightly left of center, don't like Trump,\n\n1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:05.480\n uncomfortable with like postmodern critical theories\n\n1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.480\n made into political action, right?\n\n1:29:07.480 --> 1:29:08.480\n And they're like, yeah, Twitter,\n\n1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:10.200\n there was people on there talking about this\n\n1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:12.400\n and it made me feel sort of hurt\n\n1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:14.200\n because I was feeling a little bit like a nerd about it.\n\n1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:16.120\n But honestly, I'd probably rather subscribe\n\n1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:19.320\n to the four subs, you know, I'm gonna have like Barry's\n\n1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:20.840\n and Andrew Sullivan's, I'll have like a Jesse Signals,\n\n1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:22.920\n like I'll have a few substacks I can subscribe to\n\n1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:26.920\n and honestly, I'm a knowledge worker who's 32 anyways,\n\n1:29:26.920 --> 1:29:28.240\n probably that's an email all day.\n\n1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:30.280\n And so like, there's an innovation that's gonna,\n\n1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:32.560\n that group, you know, it's gonna suck them off.\n\n1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:34.280\n Which is actually a very large group.\n\n1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.480\n Yeah, that's a lot of energy.\n\n1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:37.480\n And then once Trump's gone,\n\n1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:38.800\n I guess that's probably gonna drive,\n\n1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:42.320\n that drove a lot of more like Trump people off Twitter.\n\n1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:44.520\n Like this stuff is fragile, I think.\n\n1:29:44.520 --> 1:29:47.080\n I, but the fascinating thing to me,\n\n1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:50.720\n because I've hung out on Parler for a short amount enough\n\n1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:52.800\n to know that the interface matters.\n\n1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:54.760\n It's so fascinating like that,\n\n1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:57.480\n that it's not just about ideas.\n\n1:29:57.480 --> 1:30:00.200\n It's about creating like Substack 2,\n\n1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:04.520\n creating a pleasant experience, a dicting experience.\n\n1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:05.600\n No, you're right, you're right about that.\n\n1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:06.640\n And it's hard.\n\n1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.240\n And it's why the, this is one of the conclusions\n\n1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:09.880\n from that indie social media article\n\n1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:12.160\n is it's just the ugliness matters.\n\n1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:13.440\n And I don't mean even just aesthetically,\n\n1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:15.760\n it's just the clunkiness of the interfaces.\n\n1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:18.360\n And I don't know, it's,\n\n1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:19.840\n to some degree, the social media companies\n\n1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:21.120\n have spent a lot of money on this.\n\n1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:24.000\n And to some degree, it's a survivorship bias, right?\n\n1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.920\n I think Twitter, every time I hear Jack talks about this,\n\n1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.160\n it seems like he's as surprised as anyone else,\n\n1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:31.160\n the way Twitter is being used.\n\n1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:33.320\n I mean, it's basically the way, you know,\n\n1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:36.600\n they had it years ago.\n\n1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:38.080\n And then, you know, it was like, great,\n\n1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:39.560\n there'll be statuses, right?\n\n1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.120\n This is what I'm doing, you know?\n\n1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:42.600\n And my friends can follow me and see it.\n\n1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:43.640\n Without really changing anything,\n\n1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:46.000\n it just happened to hit everything right\n\n1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.560\n to support this other type of interaction.\n\n1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:49.440\n Well, there's also the JavaScript model,\n\n1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.360\n which Brendan Eich talked about.\n\n1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:53.440\n He just implemented JavaScript,\n\n1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.760\n like the crappy version of JavaScript in 10 days,\n\n1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:00.360\n threw it out there and just changed it really quickly,\n\n1:31:00.360 --> 1:31:01.400\n evolved it really quickly.\n\n1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:04.240\n And now it's become, according to Stack Exchange,\n\n1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:06.120\n the most popular programming language in the world\n\n1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:08.320\n that drives like most of the internet\n\n1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:10.960\n and even the backend and now mobile.\n\n1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:14.200\n And so that's an argument for the kind of thing\n\n1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:18.120\n you're talking about where like the bike club people\n\n1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:21.760\n could literally create the thing that would, you know,\n\n1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:24.560\n run most of the internet in 10 years from now.\n\n1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:25.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:27.000\n So there's something to that,\n\n1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.320\n like as opposed to trying to get lucky\n\n1:31:29.320 --> 1:31:30.480\n or trying to think through stuff\n\n1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:33.320\n is just to solve a particular problem.\n\n1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:34.160\n Do stuff, yeah.\n\n1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:35.000\n And then do stuff.\n\n1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.840\n Do stuff, keep tinkering until you love it.\n\n1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:37.680\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:31:37.680 --> 1:31:41.360\n And then, and of course the sad thing is timing and luck\n\n1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:43.880\n matter and that you can't really control.\n\n1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:44.720\n That's the problem.\n\n1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:45.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:47.840\n But you can't go back to 2007.\n\n1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:48.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:48.680 --> 1:31:49.520\n That's like the number one thing you could do\n\n1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:51.080\n to have a lot of success with a new platform\n\n1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:53.480\n is go back in time 14 years.\n\n1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:55.120\n So the thing you have to kind of think about\n\n1:31:55.120 --> 1:31:58.360\n is what is the like, what's the totally new thing\n\n1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:03.040\n that 10 years from now would seem obvious.\n\n1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:05.280\n I mean, some people saying clubhouses that,\n\n1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:08.080\n there's been a lot of stuff like clubhouse before,\n\n1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:11.280\n but it hit the right kind of thing.\n\n1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:14.120\n Similar to Tesla actually,\n\n1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:16.600\n what clubhouse did is it got a lot of\n\n1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.320\n relatively famous people on there quickly.\n\n1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:24.120\n And then the other effect is like, it's invite only.\n\n1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:27.320\n So like, oh, all the smart, like famous people are on there.\n\n1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:29.120\n I wonder what's, it's the FOMO,\n\n1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:32.320\n like fear that you're missing something really profound\n\n1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:34.280\n as exciting happening there.\n\n1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:36.120\n So those social effects.\n\n1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:37.880\n And then once they actually show up,\n\n1:32:38.840 --> 1:32:40.200\n I'm a huge fan of this.\n\n1:32:40.200 --> 1:32:42.240\n It's the JavaScript model is like,\n\n1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:46.720\n clubhouse is so dumb, like so simple in its interface.\n\n1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:50.480\n Like you literally can't do anything except mute, unmute.\n\n1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:51.520\n There's a mute button.\n\n1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:52.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:52.360 --> 1:32:53.400\n And there's a leave quietly button.\n\n1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:54.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:55.080\n And that's it.\n\n1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:55.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:56.760\n And it's kinda.\n\n1:32:56.760 --> 1:32:59.600\n I love single use technology that sense, yeah.\n\n1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:02.360\n There's no like, there's no,\n\n1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:04.800\n it's just like trivial.\n\n1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:08.320\n And Twitter kinda started like that.\n\n1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:10.080\n Facebook started like that.\n\n1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:10.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:10.920 --> 1:33:12.480\n But they've evolved quickly to add all these features\n\n1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:13.440\n and so on.\n\n1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:16.160\n And I do hope clubhouse stays that way.\n\n1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:17.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:17.840\n It'd be interesting.\n\n1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:18.680\n Or there's alternatives.\n\n1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.120\n I mean, even with clubhouse though,\n\n1:33:21.120 --> 1:33:23.040\n so one of the issues with a lot of these platforms\n\n1:33:23.040 --> 1:33:26.760\n I think is bits are cheap enough now\n\n1:33:27.840 --> 1:33:30.920\n that we don't really need a unicorn investor model.\n\n1:33:30.920 --> 1:33:32.920\n I mean, the investors need that model.\n\n1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:36.240\n There's really not really an imperative\n\n1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:39.840\n of we need something that can scale\n\n1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:42.160\n to a hundred million plus a year revenue.\n\n1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:44.800\n So, because it was gonna require this much seed\n\n1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:45.760\n and angel investment,\n\n1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:48.400\n and you're not gonna get this much seed angel investment\n\n1:33:48.400 --> 1:33:50.920\n unless you can have a potential exit this wide\n\n1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.080\n because you have to be part of a portfolio\n\n1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:55.040\n that depends on one out of 10 exiting here.\n\n1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:57.400\n If you don't actually need that\n\n1:33:57.400 --> 1:33:59.920\n and you don't need to satisfy that investor model,\n\n1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:01.680\n which I think is basically the case.\n\n1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:02.960\n I mean, bits are so cheap.\n\n1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:04.320\n Everything is so cheap.\n\n1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.600\n So even like with clubhouse, it's investor backed, right?\n\n1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:10.680\n This notion of like, this needs to be a major platform,\n\n1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:14.200\n but the bike club doesn't necessarily need a major platform.\n\n1:34:14.200 --> 1:34:15.040\n That's where I'm interested.\n\n1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:15.920\n I mean, I don't know.\n\n1:34:15.920 --> 1:34:16.920\n There's so much money.\n\n1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:18.360\n That's the only problem that bets against me\n\n1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:21.520\n is that you can concentrate a lot of capital\n\n1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:22.600\n if you do these things, right?\n\n1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:23.920\n I mean, so Facebook was like\n\n1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:26.280\n a fantastic capital concentration machine.\n\n1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:28.040\n It's crazy how much,\n\n1:34:28.040 --> 1:34:30.400\n where it even found that capital in the world\n\n1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:32.600\n that it could concentrate and ossify in the stock price\n\n1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:35.280\n that a very small number of people have access to, right?\n\n1:34:35.280 --> 1:34:37.320\n That's incredibly powerful.\n\n1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:40.760\n So when there is a possibility to consolidate\n\n1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:42.040\n and gather a huge amount of capital,\n\n1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:43.240\n that's a huge imperative\n\n1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:45.920\n that's very hard for the bike club to go up against, so.\n\n1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:47.400\n But there's a lot of money in the bike club.\n\n1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:50.720\n If you see what the Wall Street bets\n\n1:34:50.720 --> 1:34:53.120\n on that when a bunch of people get together,\n\n1:34:53.120 --> 1:34:54.800\n I mean, it doesn't have to be a bike.\n\n1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.200\n It could be a bunch of different bike clubs\n\n1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:59.360\n just kind of team up to overtake.\n\n1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:00.640\n That's what we're doing now, yeah.\n\n1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:03.240\n Or we're gonna repurpose off the shelf stuff.\n\n1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.640\n That's not, yeah, we're gonna repurpose\n\n1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:07.760\n whatever it was for office productivity or something,\n\n1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:09.600\n and like the clubs using Slack\n\n1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:11.560\n just to build out these, you know.\n\n1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:12.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.040\n Let's talk about email.\n\n1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:15.760\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:16.600\n I wrote a book.\n\n1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:20.880\n You wrote yet another amazing book,\n\n1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:22.800\n A World Without Email.\n\n1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:24.880\n Maybe one way to enter this discussion\n\n1:35:24.880 --> 1:35:28.240\n is to ask what is the hyperactive hive mind,\n\n1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:29.840\n which is the concept you opened the book with?\n\n1:35:29.840 --> 1:35:31.240\n Yeah, and the devil.\n\n1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:32.080\n And the devil.\n\n1:35:32.080 --> 1:35:35.000\n It's the scourge of hundreds of millions.\n\n1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:40.120\n So I think, so I called this book A World Without Email.\n\n1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:41.400\n The real title should be A World\n\n1:35:41.400 --> 1:35:43.880\n Without the Hyperactive Hive Mind Workflow,\n\n1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:45.760\n but my publisher didn't like that, right?\n\n1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:47.680\n So we had to get a little bit more pithy.\n\n1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:50.520\n I was trying to answer the question after deep work,\n\n1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.720\n why is it so hard to do this?\n\n1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:54.160\n Like, if this is so valuable,\n\n1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:55.600\n if we can produce much higher,\n\n1:35:55.600 --> 1:35:56.880\n if people are much happier,\n\n1:35:57.920 --> 1:35:58.960\n why do we check email a day?\n\n1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:00.840\n Why are we on Slack all day?\n\n1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:02.400\n And so I started working on this book\n\n1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:04.240\n immediately after deep work.\n\n1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:06.760\n And so my initial interviews were done in 2016.\n\n1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:08.880\n So it took five years to pull the threads together.\n\n1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:11.320\n I was trying to understand why is it so hard\n\n1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:14.440\n for most people to actually find any time\n\n1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:16.560\n to do the stuff that actually moves the needle?\n\n1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:18.360\n And the story was, and I thought this was,\n\n1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:20.000\n I hadn't heard this reported anywhere else.\n\n1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.080\n That's why it took me so long to pull it together,\n\n1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:24.440\n is email arrives on the scene,\n\n1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:26.000\n email spreads, I trace it,\n\n1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.640\n it really picks up steam in the early 1990s,\n\n1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:32.320\n between like 1990 and 1995, it makes its move, right?\n\n1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:34.080\n And it does so for very pragmatic reasons.\n\n1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:36.840\n It was replacing existing communication technologies\n\n1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:37.680\n that it was better than.\n\n1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:39.960\n It was mainly the fax machine, voicemail, and memos, right?\n\n1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:41.720\n So this was just better, right?\n\n1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:44.360\n So it was a killer app because it was useful.\n\n1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:47.840\n In its wake came a new way of collaborating,\n\n1:36:47.840 --> 1:36:49.600\n and that's the Hyperactive Hive Mind.\n\n1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:53.520\n So it's like the virus that follows the rats\n\n1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:55.840\n that went through Western Europe for the Black Pig.\n\n1:36:55.840 --> 1:36:57.920\n As email spread through organizations,\n\n1:36:57.920 --> 1:37:00.560\n in its wake came the Hyperactive Hive Mind workflow,\n\n1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:01.560\n which says, okay, guys,\n\n1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:03.560\n here's the way we're gonna collaborate.\n\n1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:05.400\n We'll just work things out on the fly\n\n1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:07.360\n with unscheduled back and forth messages.\n\n1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:09.040\n Just boom, boom, boom, let's go back and forth.\n\n1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:09.880\n Hey, what about this?\n\n1:37:09.880 --> 1:37:10.720\n Did you see this?\n\n1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:11.560\n What about that client?\n\n1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:13.200\n What's going on over here?\n\n1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:14.840\n That followed email.\n\n1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:18.200\n It completely took over office work.\n\n1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:22.320\n And the need to keep up with all of these asynchronous\n\n1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:24.400\n back and forth unscheduled messages,\n\n1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:25.640\n as those got more and more and more,\n\n1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:26.720\n and we had more of those to service,\n\n1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:29.000\n the need to service those required us to check\n\n1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.360\n more and more and more and more, right?\n\n1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:32.040\n And so by the time, and I go through the numbers,\n\n1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:34.000\n but by the time you get to today,\n\n1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:34.960\n now the average knowledge worker\n\n1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:37.480\n has to check one of these channels once every six minutes.\n\n1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.720\n Because every single thing you do in your organization,\n\n1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:40.680\n how you talk to your colleagues,\n\n1:37:40.680 --> 1:37:41.600\n how you talk to your vendors,\n\n1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.560\n how you talk to your clients,\n\n1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:43.760\n how you talk to the HR department,\n\n1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:45.400\n it's all this asynchronous unscheduled\n\n1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:47.200\n back and forth messaging.\n\n1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:49.560\n And you have to service the conversations.\n\n1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:51.320\n And it spiraled out of control,\n\n1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:54.200\n and it has sort of devolved a lot of work in the office now\n\n1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:58.800\n to all I do is constantly tend communication channels.\n\n1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:00.760\n So it's fascinating what you're describing\n\n1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:05.760\n is nobody ever paused in this whole evolution\n\n1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:08.760\n to try to create a system that actually works.\n\n1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:13.080\n That it was kind of like a huge fan of cellular automata.\n\n1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:17.440\n So it's just kind of started a very simple mechanism,\n\n1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:18.520\n just like cellular automata.\n\n1:38:18.520 --> 1:38:20.600\n It just kind of grew to overtake\n\n1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:23.320\n all the fundamental communication\n\n1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:25.400\n of how we do business and also personal life.\n\n1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:27.240\n Yeah, and that's one of the big ideas\n\n1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.800\n is that the unintentionality, right?\n\n1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:31.920\n So this goes back to technological determinism.\n\n1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:33.280\n I mean, this is a weird business book\n\n1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:35.840\n because I go deep on philosophy.\n\n1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:37.120\n I go deep on, for some reason,\n\n1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.160\n we get into paleoanthropology for a while.\n\n1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:40.320\n We do a lot of neuroscience.\n\n1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:42.440\n It's kind of a weird book.\n\n1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:44.800\n But I got real into this technological determinism, right?\n\n1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:46.920\n This notion that just the presence of a technology\n\n1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:48.720\n can change how people act.\n\n1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:49.720\n That's my big argument\n\n1:38:49.720 --> 1:38:51.080\n about what happened with the hive mind.\n\n1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:54.280\n And I can document specific examples, right?\n\n1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:59.280\n So I document this example in IBM, 1987, maybe 85,\n\n1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.240\n but it's in like the mid to late eighties,\n\n1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.600\n IBM, R. Monk headquarters.\n\n1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.560\n We're gonna put an internal email, right?\n\n1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:07.600\n Because it's convenient.\n\n1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.360\n And so they ran a whole study.\n\n1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:11.800\n And so I talked to the engineer who ran the study,\n\n1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.120\n Adrian Stone, like we're gonna run this study\n\n1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:14.800\n to figure out how much do we communicate\n\n1:39:14.800 --> 1:39:17.800\n because it was still an era where it's expensive, right?\n\n1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:19.160\n So you have to provision a mainframe.\n\n1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:20.880\n So you can't over provision.\n\n1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:22.840\n Like we wanna know how much communication actually happened.\n\n1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:24.200\n So they went and figured it out.\n\n1:39:24.200 --> 1:39:26.760\n How many memos, how many calls, how many notes, great.\n\n1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:28.760\n We'll provision a mainframe to handle email\n\n1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:29.960\n that can handle all of that.\n\n1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:32.640\n So if all of our communication moves to email,\n\n1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:34.200\n the mainframe will still be fine.\n\n1:39:34.200 --> 1:39:36.040\n In three days, they had melted it down.\n\n1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:39.480\n People were communicating six times more than that estimate.\n\n1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:42.040\n So just in three days, the presence\n\n1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:44.400\n of a low friction digital communication tool\n\n1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:46.600\n drastically changed how everyone collaborated.\n\n1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:49.560\n So that's not enough time for an all hands meeting.\n\n1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:51.120\n Guys, we figured it out.\n\n1:39:51.120 --> 1:39:52.760\n This is what we need to communicate a lot more\n\n1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:54.960\n is what's gonna make us more productive.\n\n1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:55.800\n We need more emails.\n\n1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:56.640\n It's emergent.\n\n1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:00.800\n Isn't that just on the positive end, amazing to you?\n\n1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:03.240\n Like, isn't email amazing?\n\n1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:04.680\n Like in those early days,\n\n1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:07.200\n like just the frictionless communication.\n\n1:40:07.200 --> 1:40:09.720\n I mean, email is awesome.\n\n1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:13.560\n Like people say that there's a lot of problems with emails,\n\n1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:15.080\n just like people say a lot of problems with Twitter\n\n1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:15.920\n and so on.\n\n1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:18.600\n It's kind of cool that you can just send a little note.\n\n1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:20.000\n It was a miracle, right?\n\n1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:23.880\n So I wrote a, there's originally was a New Yorker piece\n\n1:40:23.880 --> 1:40:26.160\n from a year or two ago called, was email a mistake?\n\n1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.160\n And then it's in the book too.\n\n1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:31.280\n But I go into the history of email,\n\n1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:32.800\n like why did it come along?\n\n1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:34.480\n And it solved a huge problem.\n\n1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:37.880\n It was the problem of fast asynchronous communication.\n\n1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:39.360\n And it was a problem that did not exist\n\n1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:41.040\n until we got large offices.\n\n1:40:41.040 --> 1:40:43.400\n We got large offices, synchronous communication,\n\n1:40:43.400 --> 1:40:44.800\n like let's get on the phone at the same time.\n\n1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:45.840\n There's too much overhead to it.\n\n1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:48.160\n There's too many people you might have to talk to.\n\n1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:49.280\n Asynchronous communication,\n\n1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:51.160\n like let me send you a memo when I'm ready\n\n1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:53.800\n and you can read it when you're ready, took too long.\n\n1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:55.000\n And so it was like a huge problem.\n\n1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.760\n So one of the things I talked about is the way that\n\n1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:58.960\n when they built the CIA headquarters,\n\n1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:02.120\n there was such a need for fast asynchronous communication\n\n1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:05.120\n that they built a pneumatic powered email system.\n\n1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:06.440\n They had these pneumatic tubes\n\n1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:07.720\n all throughout the headquarters\n\n1:41:07.720 --> 1:41:09.680\n with electromagnetic routers.\n\n1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:12.720\n So you would put your message in a plexiglass tube\n\n1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:15.240\n and you would turn these brass dials about the location.\n\n1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:17.280\n You would stick it in these things and pneumatic tubes\n\n1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:18.840\n and it would shoot and sort\n\n1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:20.520\n and work its way through these tubes\n\n1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:23.800\n to show up in just a minute or something at the floor\n\n1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:26.000\n and at the general office suite where you wanted to go.\n\n1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.360\n And my point is the fact that they spent so much money\n\n1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:29.240\n to make that work,\n\n1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.320\n to show how important fast asynchronous communication\n\n1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:33.160\n was to large offices.\n\n1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:35.040\n So when email came along,\n\n1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:37.080\n it was a productivity silver bullet.\n\n1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:37.920\n It was a miracle.\n\n1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:39.360\n I talked to the researchers who were working\n\n1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:41.880\n on computer supported collaboration in the late 80s,\n\n1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:43.360\n trying to figure out how are we gonna use\n\n1:41:43.360 --> 1:41:45.000\n computer networks to be more productive?\n\n1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.200\n And they were building all these systems and tools.\n\n1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:48.280\n Email showed up,\n\n1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:50.240\n it just wiped all that research off the map.\n\n1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:51.480\n There was no need to build\n\n1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.440\n these custom intranet applications.\n\n1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:56.400\n There was no need to build these communication platforms.\n\n1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.360\n Email could just do everything.\n\n1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.880\n So it was a miracle application,\n\n1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:02.800\n which is why it spread everywhere.\n\n1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.120\n That's one of these things where,\n\n1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:05.720\n okay, on into the consequences, right?\n\n1:42:05.720 --> 1:42:07.760\n You had this miracle productivity silver bullet.\n\n1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:09.240\n It spread everywhere,\n\n1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:10.640\n but it was so effective.\n\n1:42:10.640 --> 1:42:12.480\n It just, I don't know, like a drug.\n\n1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:15.400\n I'm sure there's some pandemic metaphor here,\n\n1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:17.600\n analogy here of a drug that like it's so effective\n\n1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:19.080\n at treating this that it also blows up\n\n1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:21.040\n your whole immune system and then everyone gets sick.\n\n1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:23.520\n Well, ultimately it probably significantly increased\n\n1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:24.720\n the productivity of the world,\n\n1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:28.080\n but there's a kind of hump that it now has plateaued.\n\n1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:32.160\n And then the fundamental question you're asking is like,\n\n1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:33.720\n okay, how do we take the next,\n\n1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:35.680\n how do we keep increasing the productivity?\n\n1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:36.840\n Now, I think it brought it down.\n\n1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:39.040\n So my contention,\n\n1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:42.040\n and so again, there's a little bit in the book,\n\n1:42:42.040 --> 1:42:44.080\n but I have a more recent Wired article\n\n1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:47.000\n that puts some newer numbers to this.\n\n1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.520\n I subscribed to the hypothesis\n\n1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:51.520\n that the hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental.\n\n1:42:51.520 --> 1:42:53.840\n So yeah, it helped productivity at first, right?\n\n1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:56.480\n When you could do fast asynchronous communication,\n\n1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:59.000\n but very quickly there was a sort of exponential rise\n\n1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000\n in communication amounts.\n\n1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:02.680\n Once we got to the point where the hive mind meant\n\n1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:04.440\n you had to constantly check your email,\n\n1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:06.840\n I think that made us so unproductive\n\n1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:08.240\n that it actually was pulling down\n\n1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:09.400\n non industrial productivity.\n\n1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:11.200\n And I think the only reason why,\n\n1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:12.960\n so it certainly has not been going up.\n\n1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:15.240\n That metric has been stagnating for a long time now\n\n1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:16.920\n while all of this was going on.\n\n1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:19.200\n I think the only reason why it hasn't fallen\n\n1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:22.560\n is that we added these extra shifts off the books.\n\n1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:23.880\n I'm gonna work for three hours in the morning,\n\n1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:25.600\n I'm gonna work for three hours at night.\n\n1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:27.480\n And only that I think has allowed us\n\n1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:31.640\n to basically maintain a stagnated non industrial growth.\n\n1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:33.000\n We should have been shooting up the charts.\n\n1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.480\n I mean, this is miraculous innovations,\n\n1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:36.320\n the computer networks.\n\n1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:38.560\n And then we built out these hundred billion dollar\n\n1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:41.360\n ubiquitous worldwide high speed wireless internet\n\n1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:43.400\n infrastructure with supercomputers in our pockets\n\n1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:44.840\n where we could talk to anyone at any time.\n\n1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:47.320\n Like why did our productivity not shoot off the charts?\n\n1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:48.640\n Because our brain can't context switch\n\n1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:49.480\n once every six minutes.\n\n1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:51.560\n So it's fundamentally back to the context switching.\n\n1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:53.440\n Context switching is poison.\n\n1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:54.760\n Context switching is poison.\n\n1:43:54.760 --> 1:43:58.240\n What is it about email that forces context switching?\n\n1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:00.640\n Is it both our psychology that drags us in?\n\n1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:02.200\n Or is it the expectation?\n\n1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:03.040\n Yeah, right, right.\n\n1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:04.560\n Because it's not, I think we've seen this\n\n1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:08.920\n through a personal will or failure lens recently.\n\n1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:11.720\n Like, oh, am I addicted to email?\n\n1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:14.000\n I have bad etiquette about my email.\n\n1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.040\n No, it's the underlying workflow.\n\n1:44:16.040 --> 1:44:19.360\n So the tool itself I will exonerate.\n\n1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:23.600\n I think I would rather use POP3 than a fax protocol.\n\n1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:24.960\n I think it's easier.\n\n1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:27.000\n The issue is the hyperactive hive mind workflow.\n\n1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:30.840\n So if I am now collaborating with 20 or 30 different people\n\n1:44:30.840 --> 1:44:33.000\n with back and forth unscheduled messaging,\n\n1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.160\n I have to tend those conversations, right?\n\n1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:38.160\n It's like you have 30 metaphorical ping pong tables.\n\n1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:39.360\n And when the balls come back across,\n\n1:44:39.360 --> 1:44:41.200\n you have to pretty soon hit it back\n\n1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:43.440\n or stuff actually grinds to a halt.\n\n1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:45.560\n So it's the workflow that's the problem.\n\n1:44:45.560 --> 1:44:47.080\n It's not the tools, the fact that we use it\n\n1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:48.360\n to do all of our collaboration.\n\n1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:49.840\n Let's just send messages back and forth,\n\n1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:52.760\n which means you can't be far from checking that.\n\n1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:54.800\n Cause if you take a break, if you batch,\n\n1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:56.760\n if you try to have better habits,\n\n1:44:56.760 --> 1:44:58.000\n it's gonna slow things down.\n\n1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.400\n So my whole villain is this hyperactive hive mind workflow.\n\n1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:03.560\n The tool is fine.\n\n1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:05.320\n I don't want the tool to go away,\n\n1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:07.200\n but I wanna replace the hyperactive hive mind workflow.\n\n1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:10.040\n I think this is gonna be one of the biggest\n\n1:45:10.040 --> 1:45:12.920\n value generating productivity revolutions\n\n1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:14.160\n of the 21st century.\n\n1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:16.920\n I quote an anonymous CEO who's pretty well known\n\n1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:19.600\n who says this is gonna be the moonshot of the 21st century.\n\n1:45:19.600 --> 1:45:20.960\n It's gonna be of that importance.\n\n1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:24.400\n There's so much latent productivity that's being suppressed\n\n1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.320\n because we just figure things out on the fly in email\n\n1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:27.720\n that as we figure that out,\n\n1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:32.040\n I think it's gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:35.440\n You're so absolutely right.\n\n1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:39.080\n The question is, what is a world without email look like?\n\n1:45:39.080 --> 1:45:40.880\n How do we fix email?\n\n1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:44.080\n So what happens is, at least in my vision,\n\n1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:47.480\n you identify, well, actually there's these different\n\n1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:49.200\n processes that make up my workday.\n\n1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:52.000\n Like these are things that I do repeatedly,\n\n1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:53.440\n often in collaboration with other people\n\n1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.440\n that do useful things for my company or whatever.\n\n1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:59.400\n Right now, most of these processes are implicitly implemented\n\n1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:00.640\n with the hyperactive hive mind.\n\n1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:01.560\n How do we do this thing?\n\n1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:02.640\n Like answering client questions\n\n1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:03.920\n to shoot messages back and forth.\n\n1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:05.200\n How do we do this thing?\n\n1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:06.280\n Posting podcast episodes,\n\n1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:07.800\n we'll just figure it out on the fly.\n\n1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.320\n My main argument is we actually have to do\n\n1:46:09.320 --> 1:46:11.320\n like they did in the industrial sector,\n\n1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.840\n take each of these processes and say,\n\n1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:14.880\n is there a better way to do this?\n\n1:46:14.880 --> 1:46:17.280\n And by better, I mean a way that's gonna minimize the need\n\n1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:19.200\n to have unscheduled back and forth messaging.\n\n1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:22.000\n So we actually have to do process engineering.\n\n1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.280\n This created a massive growth and productivity\n\n1:46:24.280 --> 1:46:25.880\n in the industrial sector during the 20th century.\n\n1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:26.880\n We have to do it in knowledge work.\n\n1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:28.440\n We can't just rock and roll an inbox\n\n1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:30.080\n as we actually have to say,\n\n1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.400\n how do we deal with client questions?\n\n1:46:31.400 --> 1:46:32.600\n Well, let's put in place a process\n\n1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:35.040\n that doesn't require us to send messages back and forth.\n\n1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:36.560\n How do we post podcast episodes?\n\n1:46:36.560 --> 1:46:38.520\n Let's automate this to a degree where\n\n1:46:38.520 --> 1:46:40.360\n I don't have to just send you a message on the fly.\n\n1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:43.200\n And you do this process by process\n\n1:46:43.200 --> 1:46:45.160\n and the pressure on that inbox is released.\n\n1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:46.960\n And now you don't have to check it every six minutes.\n\n1:46:46.960 --> 1:46:47.920\n So you still have email.\n\n1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:49.120\n I mean, like I need to send you a file.\n\n1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:50.320\n Sure, I'll use email,\n\n1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:52.680\n but we're not coordinating or collaborating over email\n\n1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:55.000\n or Slack, which is just a faster way of doing the hive mind.\n\n1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.840\n I mean, Slack doesn't solve anything there.\n\n1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:00.240\n You have better structured bespoke processes.\n\n1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:01.720\n I think that's what's gonna unleash\n\n1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:03.160\n this massive productivity.\n\n1:47:03.160 --> 1:47:05.640\n Bespoke, so the interesting thing is like,\n\n1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:07.600\n for example, you and I exchange some emails.\n\n1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:10.920\n So obviously I, let's just say in my particular case,\n\n1:47:10.920 --> 1:47:11.920\n I schedule podcasts.\n\n1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:13.920\n There's a bunch of different tasks,\n\n1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:16.640\n fascinatingly enough, that I do\n\n1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:18.360\n that can be converted into processes.\n\n1:47:18.360 --> 1:47:19.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:19.200 --> 1:47:21.800\n Is it up to me to create that process?\n\n1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:23.720\n Or do you think we also need to build tools\n\n1:47:23.720 --> 1:47:26.000\n just like email was a protocol\n\n1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:31.000\n for helping us create processes for the different tasks?\n\n1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:34.240\n I mean, I think ultimately the whole organization,\n\n1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:35.400\n the whole team has to be involved.\n\n1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.840\n I think ultimately there's certainly\n\n1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:38.440\n a lot of investor money being spent right now\n\n1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:40.440\n to try to figure out those tools, right?\n\n1:47:40.440 --> 1:47:42.120\n So I think Silicon Valley has figured this out\n\n1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:43.160\n in the past couple of years.\n\n1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:45.080\n This is the difference between\n\n1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:47.240\n when I was talking to people after Deep Work\n\n1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:51.680\n and now five years later is this scent is in the air, right?\n\n1:47:51.680 --> 1:47:53.280\n Because there's so much latent productivity.\n\n1:47:53.280 --> 1:47:54.880\n So yes, there are gonna be new tools,\n\n1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:55.720\n which I think could help.\n\n1:47:55.720 --> 1:47:57.040\n There are already tools that exist.\n\n1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:00.120\n I mean, in the different groups I profiled use things\n\n1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:03.760\n like Trello or Basecamp or Asana or Flow\n\n1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:06.080\n and our schedule wants and acuity,\n\n1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:08.760\n like there's a lot of tools out there.\n\n1:48:08.760 --> 1:48:10.720\n The key is not to think about it in terms of\n\n1:48:10.720 --> 1:48:12.520\n what tool do I replace email with?\n\n1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:14.360\n Instead, you think about it with,\n\n1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:16.240\n we're trying to come up with a process\n\n1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:17.680\n that reduces back and forth messages.\n\n1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:21.360\n Oh, what tool might help us do that?\n\n1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:22.320\n Yeah, and I would push,\n\n1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:24.080\n it's not about necessarily efficiency.\n\n1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:26.120\n In fact, some of these things are gonna take more time.\n\n1:48:26.120 --> 1:48:29.840\n So writing a letter to someone is like a high value activity\n\n1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:31.040\n it's probably worth doing.\n\n1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:33.520\n The thing that's killer is the back and forth\n\n1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:35.200\n because now I have to keep checking, right?\n\n1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:36.800\n So we scheduled this together\n\n1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.600\n because I knew you from before,\n\n1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:41.560\n but like most of the interviews I was scheduling for this\n\n1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:43.840\n actually I have a process with my publicist\n\n1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:46.480\n where we use a shared document and she puts stuffs in there\n\n1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:48.120\n and then I check it twice a week\n\n1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:50.120\n and there's scheduling options.\n\n1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:51.240\n I say, here's when I wanna do this one\n\n1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:52.720\n or this will work for this one or whatever.\n\n1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:55.000\n And it takes more time in the moment than just,\n\n1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.520\n but it means that we have almost no back and forth messaging\n\n1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:00.560\n for podcast scheduling, which without this,\n\n1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:02.520\n so like with my UK publisher,\n\n1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:03.920\n I didn't put this process in the place\n\n1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:06.480\n because we're not doing as many interviews,\n\n1:49:06.480 --> 1:49:07.440\n but it's all the time.\n\n1:49:07.440 --> 1:49:10.120\n And I'm like, oh, I could really feel the difference, right?\n\n1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:11.760\n It's the back and forth that's killer.\n\n1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:15.080\n I suppose it is up to the individual people involved,\n\n1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:18.120\n like you said, knowledge workers,\n\n1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:21.040\n like they have to carry the responsibility\n\n1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:23.560\n of creating processes.\n\n1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:25.960\n Like how always asking the first principles question,\n\n1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:28.280\n how can this be converted into a process?\n\n1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.680\n Yeah, so you can start by doing this yourself,\n\n1:49:30.680 --> 1:49:32.680\n like just with what you can control.\n\n1:49:32.680 --> 1:49:34.960\n I think ultimately once the teams are doing that,\n\n1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:36.440\n I think that's probably the right scale.\n\n1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.200\n If you try to do this at the organizational scale,\n\n1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:39.880\n you're gonna get bureaucracy, right?\n\n1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:44.680\n So if it's, if Elon Musk is gonna dictate down\n\n1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:46.960\n to everyone at Tesla or something like this,\n\n1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:48.680\n that's too much remove and you get bureaucracy.\n\n1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:52.200\n But if it's, we're a team of six that's working together\n\n1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:55.200\n on whatever powertrain software,\n\n1:49:55.200 --> 1:49:57.240\n then we can figure out on our own, what are our processes?\n\n1:49:57.240 --> 1:49:58.200\n How do we wanna do this?\n\n1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:00.040\n So it's ultimately also creating a culture\n\n1:50:00.040 --> 1:50:03.080\n where saying like an email, sending an email\n\n1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:05.600\n just for the hell of it, it should be taboo.\n\n1:50:05.600 --> 1:50:09.920\n So you are being, you're being destructive\n\n1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:12.560\n to the productivity of the team by sending this email.\n\n1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:17.480\n As opposed to helping develop a process and so on\n\n1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:20.760\n that will ultimately automate this.\n\n1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:22.480\n That's why I'm trying to spread this message\n\n1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:24.160\n of the context switches as poison.\n\n1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:25.440\n I get so much into the science of it.\n\n1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:28.000\n I think we underestimate how much it kills us\n\n1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:29.640\n to have to wrench away our context,\n\n1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:30.800\n look at a message and come back.\n\n1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:32.840\n And so once you have the mindset of,\n\n1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:35.160\n it's a huge thing to ask of someone\n\n1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.080\n to have to take their attention off something\n\n1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:38.160\n and look back at this.\n\n1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:40.400\n And if they have to do that for three or four times,\n\n1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:42.160\n like we're just gonna figure this out on the fly\n\n1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:44.040\n and every message is gonna require five checks\n\n1:50:44.040 --> 1:50:45.520\n of the inbox while you wait for it.\n\n1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:47.680\n Now you've created whatever it is at this point,\n\n1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:50.240\n 25 or 30 context shifts.\n\n1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:52.840\n Like you've just done a huge disservice to someone's day.\n\n1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:54.640\n This would be like, if I had a professional athlete,\n\n1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:55.920\n like, hey, do me a favor.\n\n1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:57.080\n I need you to go do this press interview,\n\n1:50:57.080 --> 1:50:59.600\n but to get there, you're gonna have to carry this sandbag\n\n1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:01.600\n and sprint up this hill, like completely exhaust\n\n1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:03.160\n your muscles and then you have to go play a game.\n\n1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:04.680\n Like, of course I'm not gonna ask an athlete\n\n1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:07.320\n to do like an incredibly physically demanding thing\n\n1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:08.640\n right before a game,\n\n1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:11.760\n but something as easy as thoughts, question mark,\n\n1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:13.280\n or like, hey, do you wanna jump on a call\n\n1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:14.920\n and it's gonna be six back and forth messages\n\n1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:15.800\n to figure it out.\n\n1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:17.760\n It's kind of the cognitive equivalent, right?\n\n1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:19.600\n You're taking the wind out of someone.\n\n1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:22.480\n Yeah, and by the way, for people who are listening,\n\n1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:24.680\n because I recently posted a few job openings\n\n1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:26.480\n for us so I wanted to help with this thing.\n\n1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:28.880\n And one of the things that people are surprised\n\n1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:30.760\n when they work with me is how many spreadsheets\n\n1:51:30.760 --> 1:51:32.160\n and processes are involved.\n\n1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:33.480\n Yeah, it's like Claude Shannon, right?\n\n1:51:33.480 --> 1:51:36.360\n I talked about communication theory or information theory.\n\n1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:38.720\n It takes time to come up with a clever code upfront.\n\n1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:40.240\n So you spend more time upfront figuring out those\n\n1:51:40.240 --> 1:51:42.880\n spreadsheets and trying to get people on board with it.\n\n1:51:42.880 --> 1:51:45.320\n But then your communication going forward\n\n1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:46.280\n is all much more efficient.\n\n1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:49.760\n So over time, you're using much less bandwidth, right?\n\n1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:52.320\n So you do pain upfront.\n\n1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:54.680\n It's quicker just right now to send an email.\n\n1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:56.160\n But if I spend a half day to do this\n\n1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:00.200\n over the next six months, I've saved myself 600 emails.\n\n1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:02.640\n Now, here's a tough question for, you know,\n\n1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:04.640\n from the computer science perspective,\n\n1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:07.080\n we often over optimize.\n\n1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:10.920\n So you've create processes and you, okay,\n\n1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.880\n just like you're saying, it's so pleasurable\n\n1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:19.720\n to increase in the longterm productivity\n\n1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:22.880\n that sometimes you just enjoy that process in itself\n\n1:52:22.880 --> 1:52:27.280\n by just creating processes and you actually never,\n\n1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:31.080\n like it has a negative effect on productivity longterm\n\n1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:33.560\n because you're too obsessed with the processes.\n\n1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:37.920\n Is that a nice problem to have essentially?\n\n1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:38.920\n I mean, it's a problem.\n\n1:52:38.920 --> 1:52:41.240\n I mean, because let's look at the one sector\n\n1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:44.560\n that does do this, which is developers, right?\n\n1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:47.240\n So agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban\n\n1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.880\n are basically workflow methodologies\n\n1:52:49.880 --> 1:52:52.400\n that are much better than the hyperactive hive mind.\n\n1:52:52.400 --> 1:52:55.800\n But man, some of those programmers get pretty obsessive.\n\n1:52:55.800 --> 1:52:57.600\n I don't know if you've ever talked to a whatever\n\n1:52:57.600 --> 1:52:59.520\n level three Scrum master.\n\n1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:02.040\n They get really obsessive about like,\n\n1:53:02.040 --> 1:53:04.280\n it has to happen exactly this way\n\n1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:06.000\n and it's probably seven times more complex\n\n1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:07.360\n than it needs to be.\n\n1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:09.840\n I'm hoping that's just because nerds like me,\n\n1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.080\n you know, like to do that,\n\n1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:14.280\n but it's a broadly probably an issue, right?\n\n1:53:14.280 --> 1:53:16.120\n We have to be careful because you can just go down\n\n1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:18.000\n that fiddling path.\n\n1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:19.840\n Like, so it needs to be, here's how we do it.\n\n1:53:19.840 --> 1:53:22.640\n Let's reduce the messages and let's roll, you know?\n\n1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:26.200\n You can't save yourself through,\n\n1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:28.280\n if you can get the process just right, right?\n\n1:53:28.280 --> 1:53:30.600\n So I wrote this article kind of recently\n\n1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:32.800\n called The Rise and Fall of Getting Things Done.\n\n1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:37.080\n And I profiled this productivity guru named Merlin Mann.\n\n1:53:37.080 --> 1:53:39.960\n And I talked about this movement called Productivity Prawn\n\n1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:42.920\n as like elite speak term in the early 2000s\n\n1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:44.520\n where people just became convinced\n\n1:53:44.520 --> 1:53:47.160\n that if they could combine their productivity systems\n\n1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:50.200\n with software and they could find just the right software,\n\n1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:51.920\n just the right configuration where they could offload\n\n1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:53.080\n most of the difficulty of work,\n\n1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:54.680\n what happened with the machines,\n\n1:53:54.680 --> 1:53:55.520\n when it kind of figured out for,\n\n1:53:55.520 --> 1:53:57.480\n and then they could just sort of crank widgets and it'd be,\n\n1:53:57.480 --> 1:53:58.680\n and the whole thing fell apart\n\n1:53:58.680 --> 1:54:00.880\n because work is hard and it's hard to do\n\n1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:03.080\n and making decisions about what to work on is hard\n\n1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:04.760\n and no system can really do that for you.\n\n1:54:04.760 --> 1:54:08.880\n So you have to have this sort of balance between,\n\n1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:10.920\n context switches are poison.\n\n1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:12.480\n So we got to get rid of the context switches.\n\n1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:13.920\n Once like something's working good enough\n\n1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:17.120\n to get rid of the context switches, then get after it.\n\n1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.520\n Yeah, there's a psychological process there for me.\n\n1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:22.600\n The OCD nature, like I've literally,\n\n1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:26.280\n embarrassing enough, have lost my shit before when,\n\n1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:30.440\n so in many of the processes that involve Python scripts,\n\n1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:34.920\n the rule is to not use spaces.\n\n1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:36.600\n Underscores, there's like rules\n\n1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:39.320\n for like how you format stuff, okay?\n\n1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:42.160\n And like, I should not lose my shit\n\n1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:45.360\n when somebody had a space and maybe capital letters,\n\n1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:48.080\n like it's okay to have a space\n\n1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:51.800\n because there's this feeling like something's not perfect.\n\n1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:54.640\n And as opposed to in the Python script,\n\n1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:56.680\n allowing some flexibility around that,\n\n1:54:56.680 --> 1:54:59.120\n you create this programmatic way that's flawless\n\n1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.760\n and when everything's working perfectly, it's perfect.\n\n1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:06.120\n But actually, if you strive for perfection,\n\n1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:10.160\n it has the same stress, like has a lot of the stress\n\n1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:12.960\n that you were seeking to escape with the context switching\n\n1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:17.960\n because you're almost stressing about errors.\n\n1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:20.880\n Like when the process is functioning,\n\n1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:23.200\n there's always this anxiety of like,\n\n1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:25.480\n I wonder if it's gonna succeed.\n\n1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:26.840\n I wonder if it's gonna succeed.\n\n1:55:26.840 --> 1:55:29.080\n Yeah, no, no, I think some of that's just you and I probably.\n\n1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:30.320\n I mean, it's just our mindset, right?\n\n1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:32.360\n We're in, we do computer science, right?\n\n1:55:32.360 --> 1:55:34.520\n So chicken and egg, I guess.\n\n1:55:34.520 --> 1:55:37.840\n And a lot of the processes end up working here much rougher.\n\n1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:39.480\n It's like, okay, instead of letting clients\n\n1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:43.760\n just email me all the time, we have a weekly call\n\n1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:45.440\n and then we send them a breakdown\n\n1:55:45.440 --> 1:55:47.640\n of everything we committed to, right?\n\n1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:48.560\n That's a process that works.\n\n1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:50.120\n Okay, I get asked a lot of questions\n\n1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:51.960\n because I'm the JavaScript guy in the company.\n\n1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.800\n Instead of doing it by email, I have office hours.\n\n1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:54.880\n This is what Basecamp does.\n\n1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:55.960\n All right, so you come to my office hours,\n\n1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:57.160\n that cuts down a lot of back and forth.\n\n1:55:57.160 --> 1:55:58.320\n All right, we're gonna, instead of emailing\n\n1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:02.040\n about this project, we'll have a Trello board\n\n1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:04.680\n and we'll do a weekly really structured status meeting\n\n1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:07.040\n real quick, what's going on, who needs what, let's go.\n\n1:56:07.040 --> 1:56:09.080\n And now everything's on there and on our inboxes,\n\n1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:10.160\n we don't have to send as many messages.\n\n1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:12.440\n So like that rough level of granularity,\n\n1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:14.520\n that gets you most of the way there.\n\n1:56:14.520 --> 1:56:17.120\n So the parts that you can't automate\n\n1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:18.680\n and turn into a process.\n\n1:56:18.680 --> 1:56:21.800\n So how many parts like that do you think\n\n1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:24.680\n should remain in a perfect world?\n\n1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:29.680\n And for those parts where email is still useful,\n\n1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:32.640\n what do you recommend those emails look like?\n\n1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:34.400\n How should you write emails?\n\n1:56:34.400 --> 1:56:35.840\n When should you send them?\n\n1:56:35.840 --> 1:56:40.760\n Yeah, I think email is good for delivering information.\n\n1:56:40.760 --> 1:56:43.360\n Right, so I think of it like a fax machine or something.\n\n1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:44.360\n It's a really good fax machine.\n\n1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:46.280\n So if I need to send you something\n\n1:56:46.280 --> 1:56:47.120\n and you just send you a file,\n\n1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:49.480\n I need to broadcast a new policy or something,\n\n1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:51.320\n like email is a great way to do it.\n\n1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:53.640\n It's bad for collaboration.\n\n1:56:53.640 --> 1:56:55.640\n So if you're having a conversation,\n\n1:56:55.640 --> 1:56:57.480\n like we're trying to reach a decision on something,\n\n1:56:57.480 --> 1:56:58.840\n I'm trying to learn about something,\n\n1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:01.440\n I'm trying to clarify what this is,\n\n1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:04.800\n that's more than just like a one answer type question,\n\n1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:07.480\n then I think that you shouldn't be doing an email.\n\n1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:08.960\n But see, here's the thing.\n\n1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:11.600\n Like you and I don't talk often\n\n1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:13.840\n and so we have a kind of new interaction.\n\n1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.520\n It's not, so sure, yeah, you have a book coming out,\n\n1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:19.040\n so there's a process and so on,\n\n1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:22.000\n but say there, don't you think there's a lot\n\n1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.280\n of novel interactive experiences?\n\n1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:25.320\n Yeah, I think it's fine.\n\n1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:27.800\n So you could, just for every novel experience,\n\n1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:29.960\n it's okay to have a little bit of exchange.\n\n1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:30.800\n Yeah, I think it's fine.\n\n1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:33.080\n Like I think it's fine if stuff comes in over the transom\n\n1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.000\n or you hear from someone you haven't heard from in a while.\n\n1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.440\n I think all that's fine.\n\n1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:39.680\n I mean, that's email at its best.\n\n1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:41.720\n Where it starts to kill us is where all\n\n1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:43.440\n of our collaboration is happening with the back and forth.\n\n1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:45.680\n So when you've moved the bulk of that out of your inbox,\n\n1:57:45.680 --> 1:57:48.880\n now you're back in that Meg Ryan movie, like You Got Mail,\n\n1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:50.880\n where it's like, all right, load this up\n\n1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:51.760\n and you wait for the boat and be like,\n\n1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:53.120\n oh, we got a message.\n\n1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:54.720\n Yeah, Lex sent me a message.\n\n1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:55.560\n This is interesting, right?\n\n1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:56.920\n You're back to the AOL days.\n\n1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:00.040\n So you're talking about the bulk of the business world\n\n1:58:00.040 --> 1:58:04.040\n where email has replaced the actual communication,\n\n1:58:04.040 --> 1:58:05.920\n all of the communication protocols required\n\n1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:06.760\n to accomplish anything.\n\n1:58:06.760 --> 1:58:08.040\n Everything is just happening with messages.\n\n1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:11.000\n So if you now get most stuff done,\n\n1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:14.040\n repeatable collaborations with other processes\n\n1:58:14.040 --> 1:58:15.600\n that don't require you to check these inboxes,\n\n1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:17.880\n then the inbox can serve like an inbox,\n\n1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:20.840\n which includes hearing from interesting people, right?\n\n1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:22.640\n Or sending something, hey, I don't know if you saw this,\n\n1:58:22.640 --> 1:58:23.480\n I thought you might like it.\n\n1:58:23.480 --> 1:58:24.720\n I think it's great for that.\n\n1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:27.560\n So there's probably a bunch of people listening to this.\n\n1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:31.080\n They're like, yeah, but I work on a team\n\n1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:33.080\n and all they use is email.\n\n1:58:33.080 --> 1:58:35.880\n How do you start the revolution from the ground up?\n\n1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:39.000\n Yeah, well, do asymmetric optimization first.\n\n1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.680\n So identify all your processes\n\n1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:42.360\n and then change what you can change\n\n1:58:42.360 --> 1:58:44.360\n and be socially very careful about it.\n\n1:58:44.360 --> 1:58:46.280\n So don't necessarily say like, okay,\n\n1:58:46.280 --> 1:58:48.280\n this is a new process we all have to do.\n\n1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:51.840\n You're just, hey, we gotta get this report ready.\n\n1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:52.880\n Here's what I think we should do.\n\n1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:54.680\n I'll get a draft into our Dropbox folder\n\n1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:57.920\n by noon on Monday, grab it.\n\n1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:00.160\n I won't touch it again until Tuesday morning\n\n1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:01.600\n and then I'll look at your changes.\n\n1:59:01.600 --> 1:59:03.880\n I have this office hours always scheduled Tuesday afternoon.\n\n1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:05.800\n So if there's anything that catches your attention,\n\n1:59:05.800 --> 1:59:07.000\n grab me then.\n\n1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:09.240\n But I've told the designer who CC'd on this\n\n1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:13.080\n that by COB Tuesday, the final version will be ready\n\n1:59:13.080 --> 1:59:14.920\n for them to take and polish or whatever.\n\n1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:16.160\n Like the person on the other end is like, great,\n\n1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:18.160\n I'm glad Cal has a plan.\n\n1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:19.280\n So what do I need to do?\n\n1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:21.300\n I need to edit this tomorrow, whatever, right?\n\n1:59:21.300 --> 1:59:22.760\n But you've actually pulled them into a process.\n\n1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.260\n That means we're gonna get this report together\n\n1:59:24.260 --> 1:59:25.920\n without having to just go back and forth.\n\n1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:29.240\n So you just asymmetrically optimize these things\n\n1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:31.400\n and then you can begin the conversation.\n\n1:59:31.400 --> 1:59:32.960\n And maybe that's where my book comes in place.\n\n1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:36.440\n You just sort of slide it across the desk.\n\n1:59:36.440 --> 1:59:39.320\n Buy the book and just leave it, give it to everybody\n\n1:59:39.320 --> 1:59:40.240\n on your team.\n\n1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:42.920\n Okay, so we solved the bulk of the email problem with this.\n\n1:59:42.920 --> 1:59:45.480\n Is there a case to be made that even for communication\n\n1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:50.480\n between you and I, we should move away from email?\n\n1:59:50.720 --> 1:59:52.480\n And for example, there's a guy, I recently,\n\n1:59:52.480 --> 1:59:53.680\n I don't know if you know comedians,\n\n1:59:53.680 --> 1:59:55.920\n but there's a guy named Joey Diaz\n\n1:59:55.920 --> 1:59:57.840\n that I've had an interaction with recently.\n\n1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:00.400\n And that guy, first of all, the sweetest human,\n\n2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:02.480\n despite what his comedy sounds like,\n\n2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:04.280\n is the sweetest human being.\n\n2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:08.560\n And he's a big proponent of just pick up the phone and call.\n\n2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:11.040\n And it makes me so uncomfortable when people call me.\n\n2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:14.040\n It's like, I don't know what to do with this thing.\n\n2:00:14.040 --> 2:00:17.720\n But it kind of gets everything done quicker, I think,\n\n2:00:17.720 --> 2:00:19.880\n if I remove the anxiety from that.\n\n2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:21.200\n Is there a case to be made for that?\n\n2:00:21.200 --> 2:00:24.240\n Or is email could still be the most efficient way\n\n2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:25.080\n to do this?\n\n2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:27.600\n No, look, if you have to interact with someone,\n\n2:00:27.600 --> 2:00:30.000\n there's a lot of efficiency and synchrony, right?\n\n2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:31.760\n And this is something from distributed system theory\n\n2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:33.360\n where you know if you go from synchronous\n\n2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:34.720\n to asynchronous networks,\n\n2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:36.600\n there's a huge amount of overhead to the asynchrony.\n\n2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.000\n So actually the protocols required to solve things\n\n2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:42.120\n in asynchronous networks are significantly more complicated\n\n2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.000\n and fragile than synchronous protocols.\n\n2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.960\n So if we can just do real time, it's usually better.\n\n2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:48.560\n And also from an interaction,\n\n2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:49.960\n like social connection standpoint,\n\n2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:51.840\n there's a lot more information in the human voice\n\n2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:53.760\n and the back and forth.\n\n2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:56.840\n Yeah, if you just call, so very generational, right?\n\n2:00:56.840 --> 2:00:59.400\n Our generation will be comfortable talking on the phone\n\n2:00:59.400 --> 2:01:01.400\n in a way that a younger generation isn't,\n\n2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:03.080\n but an older generation is more comfortable\n\n2:01:03.080 --> 2:01:05.080\n with, well, you just call people.\n\n2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:07.000\n Whereas we, so there's a happy medium,\n\n2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:09.200\n but most of my good friends, we just talk,\n\n2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:11.000\n we have regular phone calls.\n\n2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:11.840\n Okay.\n\n2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:13.000\n Yeah, it's not, I don't just call them,\n\n2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:14.440\n we schedule it, we schedule it, yeah.\n\n2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:17.920\n Just on text, like, yeah, you wanna talk sometime soon.\n\n2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:20.800\n Do you ever have a process around friends?\n\n2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:22.240\n Not really, no.\n\n2:01:22.240 --> 2:01:24.360\n I feel like I should, I feel like.\n\n2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:25.200\n Well, you have like a lot\n\n2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:27.640\n of interesting friend possibilities.\n\n2:01:27.640 --> 2:01:29.120\n You have like an interesting problem, right?\n\n2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:32.080\n Like really interesting people you can talk to.\n\n2:01:32.080 --> 2:01:33.360\n Well, that's one problem.\n\n2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:34.720\n The other one is the introversion\n\n2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:37.640\n where I'm just afraid of people and get really stressed.\n\n2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:38.760\n Like I freak out.\n\n2:01:38.760 --> 2:01:39.600\n And so.\n\n2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:41.400\n You picked a good line of work.\n\n2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:43.960\n Yeah, now perhaps it's the Goggins thing.\n\n2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:46.520\n It's like facing your fears or whatever,\n\n2:01:46.520 --> 2:01:50.440\n but it's almost like there's,\n\n2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:52.960\n it has to do with the timetables thing and the deep work\n\n2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:55.760\n that the nice thing about the processes\n\n2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:00.760\n is it not only automates sort of,\n\n2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:03.160\n automates away the context switching,\n\n2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:06.200\n it ensures you do the important things too.\n\n2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:07.440\n It's like prioritize.\n\n2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:09.920\n So the thing is with email,\n\n2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:12.280\n because everything is done over email,\n\n2:02:13.280 --> 2:02:17.000\n you can be lazy in the same way with like social networks\n\n2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:20.800\n and do the easy things first that are not that important.\n\n2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:23.000\n So the process also enforces\n\n2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:24.600\n that you do the important things.\n\n2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:27.920\n And for me, the important things is like,\n\n2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:30.120\n okay, that sounds weird, but like social connection.\n\n2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:32.760\n No, that's one of the most important things\n\n2:02:32.760 --> 2:02:34.840\n in all of human existence.\n\n2:02:34.840 --> 2:02:37.400\n And doing it, the paradoxical thing,\n\n2:02:37.400 --> 2:02:40.160\n I got into this for digital minimalism,\n\n2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:42.320\n the more you sacrifice on behalf of the connection,\n\n2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:44.240\n the stronger the connection feels, right?\n\n2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:47.000\n So sacrificing non trivial time and attention\n\n2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:48.920\n on behalf of someone is what tells your brain\n\n2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:52.080\n that this is a serious relationship,\n\n2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:54.680\n which is why social media had this paradoxical effect\n\n2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:56.920\n making people feel less social\n\n2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.360\n because it took the friction out of it.\n\n2:02:58.360 --> 2:02:59.680\n And so the brain just doesn't like,\n\n2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:01.880\n like, yeah, you've been commenting on this person's,\n\n2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:03.440\n whatever, you've been retweeting them\n\n2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:05.400\n or sending them some text.\n\n2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:07.520\n You haven't, it's not hard enough.\n\n2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:09.720\n And then the perceived strength\n\n2:03:09.720 --> 2:03:11.080\n of that social connection diminishes\n\n2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:13.320\n where if you talk to them or go spend time with them\n\n2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:16.160\n or whatever, you're gonna feel better about it.\n\n2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:17.720\n So the friction is good.\n\n2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:18.920\n I have a thing with some of my friends\n\n2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:20.680\n where at the end of each call,\n\n2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:23.120\n we take a couple minutes to schedule the next.\n\n2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:23.960\n Then you never have to,\n\n2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:25.360\n it's like I do with haircuts or something, right?\n\n2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:27.320\n Like if I don't schedule it then,\n\n2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.120\n I'm never gonna get my haircut, right?\n\n2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:32.200\n And so it's like, okay, when do you wanna talk next?\n\n2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:34.200\n Yeah, that's a really good idea.\n\n2:03:34.200 --> 2:03:36.080\n I just don't call friends.\n\n2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:39.680\n And like every 10 years I do something dramatic for them\n\n2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:40.960\n so that we maintain the friendship.\n\n2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:43.560\n We're like, I'd murder somebody that they really don't like.\n\n2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:44.400\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:03:44.400 --> 2:03:46.880\n Careful, man, Joey might ask you to do that.\n\n2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:49.320\n Yeah, that's why, that's one of my favorite things.\n\n2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:51.560\n Lex, I need you to come down to New Jersey.\n\n2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:52.400\n That's exactly what we're gonna do.\n\n2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:54.120\n With that robot dog of yours.\n\n2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:56.720\n We're gonna go down to New Jersey.\n\n2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:57.800\n There's a special human.\n\n2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:00.000\n I love the comedian world.\n\n2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:01.520\n They've been shaking up.\n\n2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:04.080\n I don't know if you listen to Joe Rogan, all those folks.\n\n2:04:04.080 --> 2:04:08.120\n They kind of are doing something interesting\n\n2:04:08.120 --> 2:04:10.480\n for MIT and academia.\n\n2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:13.080\n They're shaking up this world a little bit.\n\n2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:15.520\n Like podcasting, because comedians are paving the way\n\n2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:17.040\n for podcasting.\n\n2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:18.800\n And so you have like Andrew Huberman,\n\n2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:21.400\n who's a neuroscientist at Stanford, friend of mine now.\n\n2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:27.080\n He's like into podcasting now and you're into podcasting.\n\n2:04:27.080 --> 2:04:29.160\n Of course, you're not necessarily podcasting\n\n2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:30.960\n about computer science currently, right?\n\n2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:35.760\n But that, it feels like you could have a lot\n\n2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:40.480\n of the free spirit of the comedians implemented\n\n2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:43.880\n by the people who are academically trained.\n\n2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:46.720\n Who actually have a niche specialty.\n\n2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:49.240\n Yeah, and then that results, I mean,\n\n2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:51.320\n who knows what the experiment looks like,\n\n2:04:51.320 --> 2:04:54.160\n but that results me being able to talk about robotics\n\n2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:56.920\n with Joey Diaz when he says, you know,\n\n2:04:56.920 --> 2:04:58.640\n drops F bombs every other sentence.\n\n2:04:58.640 --> 2:05:02.720\n And I, the world is like, I've seen actually a shift\n\n2:05:02.720 --> 2:05:06.240\n within colleagues and friends within MIT\n\n2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:08.480\n where they're becoming much more accepting\n\n2:05:08.480 --> 2:05:09.320\n of that kind of thing.\n\n2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:10.480\n It's very interesting.\n\n2:05:10.480 --> 2:05:11.320\n That's interesting.\n\n2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:12.720\n So you're seeing, okay.\n\n2:05:12.720 --> 2:05:14.480\n Because they're seeing how popular it is.\n\n2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:15.320\n They're like, wait a minute.\n\n2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:16.160\n Well, you're really popular.\n\n2:05:16.160 --> 2:05:17.320\n I don't know how they think about it\n\n2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:18.880\n at Georgetown, for example.\n\n2:05:18.880 --> 2:05:19.720\n I don't know.\n\n2:05:19.720 --> 2:05:22.080\n It's interesting, but I think what happens\n\n2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:25.160\n is the popularity of it combined\n\n2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:29.760\n with just good conversations with people they respect.\n\n2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:32.720\n It's like, oh, wait, this is the thing.\n\n2:05:32.720 --> 2:05:33.560\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:34.760\n And this is more fun to listen to\n\n2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:39.160\n than a shitty Zoom lecture about their work.\n\n2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:40.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:40.840\n It's like, there's something here.\n\n2:05:40.840 --> 2:05:41.680\n There's something interesting.\n\n2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:44.000\n And we don't, nobody actually knows what that is.\n\n2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.560\n Just like with like Clubhouse or something,\n\n2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:49.120\n nobody's figured out like, where does this medium take?\n\n2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:51.520\n Is this a legitimate medium of education?\n\n2:05:51.520 --> 2:05:52.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:54.320\n Or is this just like a fun?\n\n2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:55.520\n Well, that's your innovation, I think,\n\n2:05:55.520 --> 2:05:58.040\n was we can bring on professors.\n\n2:05:58.040 --> 2:05:58.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:00.560\n And I know Joe Rogan did some of that too,\n\n2:06:00.560 --> 2:06:04.880\n but your professors in your field.\n\n2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:05.720\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:06:05.720 --> 2:06:08.280\n You bring on all these MIT guys who I remember.\n\n2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:10.160\n Well, that's been the big challenge for me is,\n\n2:06:10.160 --> 2:06:13.400\n I don't, is I feel,\n\n2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:17.680\n I would ask big like philosophical questions\n\n2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:20.760\n of people like yourself.\n\n2:06:20.760 --> 2:06:23.480\n They're like really well public.\n\n2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:25.920\n Like, so for example, you have a lot of excellent papers\n\n2:06:25.920 --> 2:06:30.920\n on, you know, that has a lot of theory in it, right?\n\n2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:35.400\n And there's some temptation to just go through papers.\n\n2:06:35.400 --> 2:06:37.040\n And I think it's possible to actually do that.\n\n2:06:37.040 --> 2:06:39.400\n I haven't done that much, but I think it's possible.\n\n2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:41.680\n It just requires a lot of preparation.\n\n2:06:41.680 --> 2:06:43.880\n And I can probably only do that with things\n\n2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:48.040\n that I'm actually like in the field I'm aware of.\n\n2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:51.080\n But there's a dance that I would love to be able\n\n2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:53.280\n to try to hit right where it's actually getting\n\n2:06:53.280 --> 2:06:54.960\n to the core of some interesting ideas\n\n2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:56.920\n as opposed to just talking about philosophy.\n\n2:06:56.920 --> 2:06:59.800\n At the same time, there's a large audience of people\n\n2:06:59.800 --> 2:07:04.280\n that just want to be inspired by disciplines\n\n2:07:04.280 --> 2:07:07.200\n where they don't necessarily know the details.\n\n2:07:07.200 --> 2:07:08.520\n But there's a lot of people that are like,\n\n2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:10.600\n hmm, I'm really curious.\n\n2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:13.080\n I've been thinking about pivoting careers\n\n2:07:13.080 --> 2:07:14.680\n into software engineering.\n\n2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:16.680\n They would love to hear from people like you\n\n2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:17.920\n about computer science.\n\n2:07:17.920 --> 2:07:19.240\n Even if it's like theory.\n\n2:07:19.240 --> 2:07:22.120\n Yeah, but just like the idea that you can have big ideas,\n\n2:07:22.120 --> 2:07:24.000\n you push them through and it's interesting,\n\n2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:25.120\n you fight for it, yeah.\n\n2:07:25.120 --> 2:07:27.640\n Well, there's some, there's what is it?\n\n2:07:27.640 --> 2:07:32.640\n Computerphile and Numberphile, these YouTube channels.\n\n2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:37.160\n There's channels I watch on like chess, exceptionally popular\n\n2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:41.400\n where I don't understand maybe 80% of the time\n\n2:07:41.400 --> 2:07:42.640\n what the hell they're talking about\n\n2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:44.520\n because they're talking about like why this move\n\n2:07:44.520 --> 2:07:45.480\n is better than this move.\n\n2:07:45.480 --> 2:07:48.400\n But I love the passion and the genius of those people\n\n2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:49.600\n and just overhearing it.\n\n2:07:49.600 --> 2:07:50.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:52.000\n I don't know why that's so exciting.\n\n2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:53.960\n Do you look at like Scott Aaronson's blog at all?\n\n2:07:53.960 --> 2:07:55.120\n The Settled, Optimized?\n\n2:07:55.120 --> 2:07:57.800\n Yeah, it's like hardcore complexity theory.\n\n2:07:57.800 --> 2:08:01.160\n But it's just an enthusiasm or like Terry Tao's blog.\n\n2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:02.600\n A little bit of humor about it.\n\n2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:03.800\n Terry Tao has a blog?\n\n2:08:03.800 --> 2:08:04.640\n He used to, yeah.\n\n2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:09.040\n And it would just be, I'm going all in on,\n\n2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:11.560\n here's a new affine group with which you can do whatever.\n\n2:08:11.560 --> 2:08:12.960\n Whatever, it was just equations.\n\n2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:14.240\n Well, in the case of Scott Aaronson,\n\n2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:19.240\n he's good, he's able to turn on like the inner troll\n\n2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:20.560\n and comedian and so on.\n\n2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:21.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:21.400 --> 2:08:22.760\n He keeps the fun, which is the best\n\n2:08:22.760 --> 2:08:24.120\n of kinds of books. And he's a philosophical guy.\n\n2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:24.960\n He wrote that.\n\n2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:27.080\n He turns on the philosophy. Yeah.\n\n2:08:27.080 --> 2:08:30.360\n Yeah, so we're exploring these different ways\n\n2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:33.440\n of communicating science and exciting the world.\n\n2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:36.600\n Speaking of which, I gotta ask you about computer science.\n\n2:08:36.600 --> 2:08:39.280\n Yeah, that's right, I do some of that.\n\n2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:43.560\n So, I mean, a lot of your work is what inspired\n\n2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:46.440\n this deep thinking about productivity\n\n2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:48.760\n from all the different angles,\n\n2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:50.400\n because some of the most rigorous work\n\n2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:52.040\n is mathematical work.\n\n2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:55.040\n And in computer science, the theoretical computer science,\n\n2:08:55.040 --> 2:08:57.440\n let me ask the Scott Aaronson question of like,\n\n2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.760\n is there something to you that stands out in particular\n\n2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:03.440\n that's beautiful or inspiring,\n\n2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:05.920\n or just really insightful about computer science\n\n2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:08.440\n or maybe mathematics?\n\n2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:11.240\n I mean, I like theory.\n\n2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:13.120\n And in particular, what I've always liked in theory\n\n2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:14.880\n is the notion of impossibilities.\n\n2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:16.640\n That's kind of my specialty.\n\n2:09:16.640 --> 2:09:19.880\n So within the context of distributed algorithms,\n\n2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:21.680\n my specialty is impossibility results.\n\n2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:23.880\n So the idea that you can argue\n\n2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:26.080\n nothing exists that solves this,\n\n2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:30.520\n or nothing exists that can solve this faster than this.\n\n2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.040\n And I think that's really interesting.\n\n2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:34.640\n And that goes all the way back to Turing.\n\n2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:37.800\n His original paper on computable numbers\n\n2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:40.280\n with their connection to the German Eichsturzungen problem,\n\n2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:41.880\n but basically the German name\n\n2:09:41.880 --> 2:09:43.440\n that Hilbert called the decision problem.\n\n2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:46.320\n This was precomputers, but he's English,\n\n2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:47.160\n so it's written in English.\n\n2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:48.800\n So it's a very accessible paper.\n\n2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:50.520\n And it lays the foundation\n\n2:09:50.520 --> 2:09:51.960\n for all of theoretical computer science.\n\n2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.160\n He just has this insight.\n\n2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:55.160\n He's like, well, if we think about like an algorithm,\n\n2:09:55.160 --> 2:09:57.720\n I mean, he figures out like all effective procedures\n\n2:09:57.720 --> 2:09:59.640\n or Turing machines are basically algorithms.\n\n2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:02.040\n We could really describe a Turing machine with a number,\n\n2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:04.160\n which we can now imagine with like computer code,\n\n2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:05.600\n you could just take a source file\n\n2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:07.680\n and just treat the binary version of the file\n\n2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:09.440\n as like a really long number, right?\n\n2:10:09.440 --> 2:10:12.440\n But he's like, every program is just a finite number.\n\n2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:14.000\n It's a natural number.\n\n2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.560\n And then he realized like one way to think about a problem\n\n2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:19.400\n is you have, and this is like kind of the Mike Sipser\n\n2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:21.800\n approach, but you have a sort of, it's a language.\n\n2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:23.480\n So of an infinite number of strings,\n\n2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:25.040\n some of them are in the language and some of them aren't,\n\n2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:27.360\n but basically you can imagine a problem is represented\n\n2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:29.360\n as an infinite binary string,\n\n2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:31.440\n where in every position, like a one means that string\n\n2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:33.640\n is in the language and a zero means it isn't.\n\n2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:37.520\n And then he applied Cantor from the 19th century and said,\n\n2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:39.760\n okay, the natural numbers are countable.\n\n2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:43.760\n So it's countably infinite and infinite binary strings,\n\n2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:45.160\n you can use a diagonalization argument\n\n2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:47.960\n and show they're uncountable.\n\n2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:50.800\n So there's just vastly more problems\n\n2:10:50.800 --> 2:10:51.920\n than there are algorithms.\n\n2:10:51.920 --> 2:10:54.000\n So basically anything you can come up with for the most part\n\n2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.640\n almost certainly is not solvable by a computer.\n\n2:10:56.640 --> 2:10:58.800\n And then he was like, let me give a particular example.\n\n2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:01.240\n And he figured out the very first computability proof.\n\n2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:03.760\n Let's just walk through with a little bit of simple logic\n\n2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:05.920\n to halting problem can't be solved by an algorithm.\n\n2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:08.840\n And that kicked off the whole enterprise\n\n2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:12.800\n of some things can't be solved by algorithms,\n\n2:11:12.800 --> 2:11:14.280\n some things can't be solved by computers.\n\n2:11:14.280 --> 2:11:16.280\n And we've just been doing theory on that\n\n2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:18.600\n since that was the 30s he wrote that.\n\n2:11:18.600 --> 2:11:21.120\n So proving that something is impossible\n\n2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:23.400\n is sort of a stricter version of that.\n\n2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:26.280\n Is it like proving bounds on the performance\n\n2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:27.120\n of different algorithms?\n\n2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:29.360\n Yeah, so bounds are upper bounds, right?\n\n2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:32.920\n So you say, this algorithm does at least this well\n\n2:11:32.920 --> 2:11:33.760\n and no worse than this,\n\n2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.600\n but you're looking at a particular algorithm\n\n2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.240\n and possibility proof say no algorithm ever\n\n2:11:39.240 --> 2:11:40.160\n could ever solve this problem.\n\n2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:42.520\n So no algorithm could ever solve the halting problem.\n\n2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:43.920\n So it's problem centric.\n\n2:11:43.920 --> 2:11:46.160\n It's making something different,\n\n2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:48.520\n making a conclusive statement about the problem.\n\n2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:49.360\n Yes.\n\n2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:51.800\n And that's somehow satisfying because it's...\n\n2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:53.200\n It's just philosophically interesting.\n\n2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:54.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:54.040 --> 2:11:55.880\n I mean, it all goes back to, you get back to Plato,\n\n2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:58.360\n it's all reductio ad absurdum.\n\n2:11:58.360 --> 2:11:59.680\n So all these arguments have to start.\n\n2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:00.520\n The only way to do it\n\n2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:01.960\n is because there's an infinite number of solutions\n\n2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:02.800\n you can't go through them.\n\n2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:06.360\n You say, let's assume for the sake of contradiction\n\n2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:09.080\n that there existed something that solves this problem.\n\n2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:10.320\n And then you turn to crank a logic\n\n2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:11.760\n until you blow up the universe.\n\n2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:12.600\n And then you go back and say,\n\n2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:13.960\n okay, our original assumption\n\n2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:16.560\n that this solution exists can't be true.\n\n2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:17.720\n I just think philosophically,\n\n2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:19.800\n it's like a really exciting kind of beautiful thing.\n\n2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:22.120\n It's what I specialize in within distributed algorithms\n\n2:12:22.120 --> 2:12:24.880\n is more like time bound and possibility results.\n\n2:12:24.880 --> 2:12:28.740\n Like no algorithm can solve this problem faster than this\n\n2:12:28.740 --> 2:12:29.720\n in this setting.\n\n2:12:29.720 --> 2:12:32.120\n Of all the infinite number of ways you might ever do it.\n\n2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:34.120\n So you have many papers,\n\n2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:35.480\n but the one that caught my eye\n\n2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:38.440\n is Smooth Analysis of Dynamic Networks,\n\n2:12:38.440 --> 2:12:40.680\n in which you write,\n\n2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:42.800\n a problem with the worst case perspective\n\n2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:45.640\n is that it often leads to extremely strong lower bounds.\n\n2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:48.120\n These strong results motivate a key question.\n\n2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:49.920\n Is this bond robust in the sense\n\n2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:52.080\n that it captures the fundamental difficulty\n\n2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.960\n introduced by dynamism?\n\n2:12:53.960 --> 2:12:56.600\n Or is the bond fragile in the sense\n\n2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:58.320\n that the poor performance it describes\n\n2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:02.080\n depends on an exact sequence of adversarial changes.\n\n2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:05.240\n Fragile lower bounds leave open the possibility\n\n2:13:05.240 --> 2:13:08.680\n of algorithms that might still perform well in practice.\n\n2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:11.760\n That's in the sense of the impossible\n\n2:13:11.760 --> 2:13:15.280\n and the bounds discussion presents the interesting question.\n\n2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:18.440\n I just like the idea of robust and fragile bounds,\n\n2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:23.000\n but what do you make about this kind of tension\n\n2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.760\n between what's provably,\n\n2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:30.000\n like what bounds you can prove that are like robust\n\n2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.520\n and something that's a bit more fragile.\n\n2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:36.040\n And also by way of answering that\n\n2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:38.120\n for this particular paper,\n\n2:13:38.120 --> 2:13:41.400\n can you say what the hell are dynamic networks?\n\n2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:42.240\n What are distributed algorithms?\n\n2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:43.080\n You don't know this?\n\n2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:43.920\n Come on now.\n\n2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:44.880\n And I have no idea.\n\n2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:46.160\n And what is Smooth Analysis?\n\n2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:47.000\n Yeah, well, okay.\n\n2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:49.960\n So Smooth Analysis, so it wasn't my idea.\n\n2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:52.400\n So Spielman and Tang came up with this\n\n2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:54.320\n in the context of sequential algorithms.\n\n2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:57.040\n So just like the normal world of an algorithm\n\n2:13:57.040 --> 2:13:58.440\n that runs on a computer.\n\n2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:01.640\n And they were looking at, there's a well known algorithm\n\n2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:02.760\n called the simplex algorithm,\n\n2:14:02.760 --> 2:14:06.440\n but basically you're trying to find a hole\n\n2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:07.480\n around a group of points.\n\n2:14:07.480 --> 2:14:08.320\n And there was an algorithm\n\n2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.480\n that worked really well in practice.\n\n2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:12.080\n But when you analyze it, you would say,\n\n2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:13.960\n I can't guarantee it's gonna work well in practice\n\n2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:16.400\n because if you have just the right inputs,\n\n2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:18.960\n this thing could run really long.\n\n2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:20.480\n But in practice, it seemed to be really fast.\n\n2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:22.560\n So Smooth Analysis is they came in and they said,\n\n2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:25.960\n let's assume that a bad guy chooses the inputs.\n\n2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:27.880\n It could be anything like really bad ones.\n\n2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:30.880\n And all we're gonna do, because in simplex they're numbers,\n\n2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:33.520\n we're gonna just randomly put a little bit of noise\n\n2:14:33.520 --> 2:14:34.720\n on each of the numbers.\n\n2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:36.080\n And they said, if you put a little bit of noise\n\n2:14:36.080 --> 2:14:39.720\n on the numbers, suddenly simplex algorithm goes really fast.\n\n2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:41.680\n Like, oh, that explains this lower bound,\n\n2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:44.280\n this idea that it could sometimes run really long\n\n2:14:44.280 --> 2:14:46.280\n was a fragile bound because it could only run\n\n2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:47.840\n a really long time if you had exactly\n\n2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:49.800\n the worst pathological input.\n\n2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:51.560\n So then my collaborators and I brought this over\n\n2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:53.560\n to the world of distributed algorithms.\n\n2:14:53.560 --> 2:14:55.360\n We brought them over the general lower bounds, right?\n\n2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:58.080\n So in the world of dynamic networks,\n\n2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:00.080\n so distributed algorithm is a bunch of algorithms\n\n2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:02.440\n on different machines talking to each other,\n\n2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:03.280\n trying to solve a problem.\n\n2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:05.000\n And sometimes they're in a network.\n\n2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.440\n So you imagine them connected with network links\n\n2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:10.000\n and a dynamic network, those can change, right?\n\n2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.280\n So I was talking to you, but now I can't talk to you anymore.\n\n2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:14.000\n Now I'm connected to a person over here.\n\n2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:16.440\n It's a really hard environment mathematically speaking.\n\n2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:19.040\n And there's a lot of really strong lower bounds,\n\n2:15:19.040 --> 2:15:20.720\n which you could imagine if the network can change\n\n2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:23.520\n all the time and a bad guy is doing it,\n\n2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:24.960\n it's like hard to do things well.\n\n2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:27.280\n So there's an algorithm running on every single node\n\n2:15:27.280 --> 2:15:28.120\n in the network.\n\n2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:28.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:30.760\n And then you're trying to say something of any kind\n\n2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:32.840\n that makes any kind of definitive sense\n\n2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:34.800\n about the performance of that algorithm.\n\n2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:37.520\n Yeah, so I just submitted a new paper on this\n\n2:15:37.520 --> 2:15:38.360\n a couple of weeks ago.\n\n2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:39.840\n And we were looking at a very simple problem.\n\n2:15:39.840 --> 2:15:42.280\n There's some messages in the network.\n\n2:15:42.280 --> 2:15:44.200\n We want everyone to get them.\n\n2:15:44.200 --> 2:15:46.880\n If the network doesn't change,\n\n2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:47.860\n you can do this pretty well.\n\n2:15:47.860 --> 2:15:48.700\n You can pipeline them.\n\n2:15:48.700 --> 2:15:52.120\n There's some basic algorithms that work really well.\n\n2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:54.100\n If the network can change every round,\n\n2:15:54.100 --> 2:15:57.040\n there's these lower bounds that says,\n\n2:15:57.040 --> 2:15:58.020\n it takes a really long time.\n\n2:15:58.020 --> 2:16:00.160\n There's a way that no matter what algorithm you come up with,\n\n2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:02.100\n there's a way the network can change in such a way\n\n2:16:02.100 --> 2:16:05.600\n that just really slows down your progress basically, right?\n\n2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:07.240\n So smooth analysis there says, yeah,\n\n2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:10.140\n but that seems like you'd have really bad luck\n\n2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:14.520\n if your network was changing exactly in the right way\n\n2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:15.920\n that you needed to screw your algorithm.\n\n2:16:15.920 --> 2:16:19.120\n So we said, what if we randomly just add\n\n2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:20.600\n or remove a couple of edges in every round?\n\n2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:21.640\n So the adversary is trying to choose\n\n2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:22.640\n the worst possible network.\n\n2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:24.800\n And we're just tweaking it a little bit.\n\n2:16:24.800 --> 2:16:25.960\n And in that case, this is a new paper.\n\n2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:27.520\n I mean, it's a blinded submission,\n\n2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:30.320\n so maybe I shouldn't, it's not, whatever.\n\n2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:31.640\n We basically showed.\n\n2:16:31.640 --> 2:16:33.600\n An anonymous friend of yours submitted a paper.\n\n2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:35.720\n An anonymous friend of mine, yeah,\n\n2:16:35.720 --> 2:16:37.840\n whose paper should be accepted.\n\n2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:40.680\n Showed that even just adding like one random edge per round,\n\n2:16:42.480 --> 2:16:43.320\n and here's the cool thing about it,\n\n2:16:43.320 --> 2:16:46.080\n the simplest possible solution to this problem\n\n2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:47.920\n blows away that lower bound and does really well.\n\n2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:50.120\n So that's like a very fragile lower bound\n\n2:16:50.120 --> 2:16:53.120\n because we're like, it's almost impossible\n\n2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:55.360\n to actually keep things slow.\n\n2:16:55.360 --> 2:16:59.920\n I wonder how many lower bounds you can smash open\n\n2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:02.440\n with this kind of analysis and show that they're fragile.\n\n2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:03.640\n It's my interest, yeah.\n\n2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:05.680\n Because in distributed algorithms,\n\n2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:08.320\n there's a ton of really famous strong lower bounds,\n\n2:17:08.320 --> 2:17:12.520\n but things have to go wrong, really, really wrong\n\n2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:14.600\n for these lower bound arguments to work.\n\n2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:15.680\n And so I like this approach.\n\n2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:17.960\n So this whole notion of fragile versus robust,\n\n2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:20.200\n I was like, well, let's go in and just throw\n\n2:17:20.200 --> 2:17:21.080\n a little noise in there.\n\n2:17:21.080 --> 2:17:23.880\n And if it becomes solvable, then maybe that lower bound\n\n2:17:23.880 --> 2:17:25.520\n wasn't really something we should worry about.\n\n2:17:25.520 --> 2:17:27.320\n You know, that's gonna embarrass,\n\n2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:28.560\n that's really uncomfortable.\n\n2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:31.480\n That's really embarrassing to a lot of people.\n\n2:17:31.480 --> 2:17:35.880\n Because, okay, this is the OCD thing with the spaces,\n\n2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:39.000\n is it feels really good when you can prove a nice bound.\n\n2:17:39.000 --> 2:17:43.400\n And if you say that that bound is fragile,\n\n2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:46.080\n that's like, there's gonna be a sad kid\n\n2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:49.760\n that walks with their lunchbox back home,\n\n2:17:49.760 --> 2:17:52.320\n like, my lower bound doesn't matter.\n\n2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:53.280\n No, I don't think they care.\n\n2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:55.400\n It's all, I don't know, it feels like to me,\n\n2:17:55.400 --> 2:17:57.680\n a lot of this theory is just math machismo.\n\n2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:00.440\n It's like, whatever, this was a hard bound to prove.\n\n2:18:00.440 --> 2:18:02.240\n What do you think about that?\n\n2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:03.720\n So if you show that something is fragile,\n\n2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:07.200\n that's really important in practice, right?\n\n2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:10.760\n So do you think kind of theoretical computer science\n\n2:18:10.760 --> 2:18:13.320\n is living its own world, just like mathematics,\n\n2:18:13.320 --> 2:18:16.320\n and their main effort, which I think is very valuable,\n\n2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:19.360\n is to develop ideas that's not necessarily interesting,\n\n2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:21.040\n whether it's applicable in the real world.\n\n2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:22.720\n Yeah, we don't care about the applicability.\n\n2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:24.640\n Yeah, we kind of do, but not really.\n\n2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:26.120\n And we're terrible with computers,\n\n2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:27.800\n and can't do anything useful with computers,\n\n2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:28.720\n and we don't know how to code.\n\n2:18:28.720 --> 2:18:31.880\n And, you know, we're not productive members\n\n2:18:31.880 --> 2:18:33.320\n of like technological society,\n\n2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:36.280\n but I do think things percolate.\n\n2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:37.120\n Exactly.\n\n2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:38.680\n You percolate from the world of theory\n\n2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:40.120\n into the world of algorithm design,\n\n2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:41.280\n where it will pull on the theory,\n\n2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:43.360\n and now suddenly it's useful,\n\n2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:44.480\n and then the algorithm design\n\n2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:45.840\n gets pulled into the world of practice,\n\n2:18:45.840 --> 2:18:46.680\n where they say, well, actually,\n\n2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:47.800\n we can make this algorithm a lot better,\n\n2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:50.120\n because in practice, really, these servers do X, Y, Z,\n\n2:18:50.120 --> 2:18:51.680\n and now we can make this super efficient.\n\n2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:54.600\n And so I do think, I mean, I teach theory\n\n2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:56.560\n to the PhD students at Georgetown.\n\n2:18:56.560 --> 2:18:58.960\n I show them the sort of funnel of like,\n\n2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:00.120\n okay, we're over here doing theory,\n\n2:19:00.120 --> 2:19:01.640\n but it eventually, some of this stuff\n\n2:19:01.640 --> 2:19:04.440\n will percolate down in effect at the very end, you know,\n\n2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:08.120\n a phone, but it's a long tunnel.\n\n2:19:08.120 --> 2:19:10.080\n But the very question you're asking,\n\n2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:12.400\n at the highest philosophical level, is fascinating.\n\n2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:15.000\n Like, if you take a system, a distributed system,\n\n2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:19.520\n or a network, and introduce a little bit of noise into it,\n\n2:19:19.520 --> 2:19:23.320\n like, how many problems of that nature\n\n2:19:23.320 --> 2:19:25.240\n are fundamentally changed\n\n2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:27.560\n by that little introduction of noise?\n\n2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:29.080\n Yeah, because it's all,\n\n2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:30.280\n especially in distributed algorithms,\n\n2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:31.560\n the model is everything.\n\n2:19:31.560 --> 2:19:34.160\n Like, the way we work is we're incredibly precise about,\n\n2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:36.040\n here's exactly, it's mathematical,\n\n2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:37.560\n here's exactly how the network works,\n\n2:19:37.560 --> 2:19:40.160\n and it's a state machine, algorithms are state machines,\n\n2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:41.360\n there's rounds and schedulers,\n\n2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:44.200\n we're super precise so we can prove lower bounds.\n\n2:19:44.200 --> 2:19:45.120\n But yeah, often those lower,\n\n2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:48.800\n those impossibility results really get at the hard edges\n\n2:19:48.800 --> 2:19:50.560\n of exactly how that model works.\n\n2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:53.560\n So we'll see if this, so we published a paper on this,\n\n2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:55.560\n that paper you mentioned,\n\n2:19:55.560 --> 2:19:56.800\n that kind of introduced the idea\n\n2:19:56.800 --> 2:19:58.120\n to the distributed algorithms world.\n\n2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:01.120\n And I think that's got some traction\n\n2:20:01.120 --> 2:20:02.200\n and there's been some followup.\n\n2:20:02.200 --> 2:20:05.720\n So we've just submitted our next.\n\n2:20:05.720 --> 2:20:07.000\n I mean, honestly, the issue with the next\n\n2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:09.320\n that like the result fell out so easily,\n\n2:20:09.320 --> 2:20:11.080\n and this shows the mathematical machismo problem\n\n2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:13.920\n in these fields is there's a good chance\n\n2:20:13.920 --> 2:20:15.000\n the paper won't be accepted\n\n2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:18.200\n because there wasn't enough mathematical self flagellation.\n\n2:20:18.200 --> 2:20:20.240\n That's such a nice finding.\n\n2:20:20.240 --> 2:20:22.560\n So even showing that very few,\n\n2:20:22.560 --> 2:20:24.360\n just very little bit of noise,\n\n2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:28.000\n can have a dramatic, make a dramatic statement about the.\n\n2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:29.360\n It was a big surprise to us,\n\n2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:31.520\n but once we figured out how to show it,\n\n2:20:32.440 --> 2:20:34.120\n it's not too hard.\n\n2:20:34.120 --> 2:20:38.880\n And these are venues for theoretical work.\n\n2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:41.160\n Okay, so the fascinating tension\n\n2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:42.520\n that exists in other disciplines,\n\n2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:45.000\n like one of them is machine learning,\n\n2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:48.760\n which despite the power of machine learning\n\n2:20:48.760 --> 2:20:52.720\n and deep learning and all like the impact of it,\n\n2:20:52.720 --> 2:20:53.840\n in the real world,\n\n2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:55.960\n the main conferences on machine learning\n\n2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:58.400\n are still resistant to application papers.\n\n2:21:01.480 --> 2:21:03.880\n And application papers broadly defined,\n\n2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:08.160\n meaning like finding almost like you would,\n\n2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:12.760\n like Darwin did by like going around,\n\n2:21:12.760 --> 2:21:14.040\n collecting some information,\n\n2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:15.800\n saying, huh, isn't this interesting?\n\n2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:19.200\n Like those are some of the most popular blogs,\n\n2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:21.320\n and yet as a paper, it's not really accepted.\n\n2:21:21.320 --> 2:21:23.400\n I wonder what you think about this whole world\n\n2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:27.900\n of deep learning from a perspective of theory.\n\n2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:31.720\n What do you make of this whole discipline\n\n2:21:31.720 --> 2:21:33.240\n of the success of Neon Networks,\n\n2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:34.920\n of how to do science on them?\n\n2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:37.960\n Are you excited by the possibilities\n\n2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:40.080\n of what we might discover about Neon Networks?\n\n2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:42.320\n Do you think it's fundamental in engineering discipline,\n\n2:21:42.320 --> 2:21:44.660\n or is there something theoretical\n\n2:21:44.660 --> 2:21:47.480\n that we might crack open one of these days\n\n2:21:47.480 --> 2:21:48.820\n in understanding something deep\n\n2:21:48.820 --> 2:21:52.160\n about how system optimization and how systems learn?\n\n2:21:52.160 --> 2:21:56.160\n I am convinced by, is it Tegmark at MIT?\n\n2:21:56.160 --> 2:21:58.000\n Tegmark? Yeah, Tegmark, right.\n\n2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:00.200\n So his notion has always been convincing to me\n\n2:22:00.200 --> 2:22:04.840\n that the fact that some of these models are inscrutable\n\n2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:06.880\n is not fundamental to them,\n\n2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:08.640\n and that we can, we're gonna get better and better,\n\n2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:09.960\n because in the end, you know,\n\n2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:12.640\n the reason why practicing computer scientists often\n\n2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:15.600\n who are doing AI or working at AI and industry\n\n2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:18.680\n aren't like worried about so much existential threats\n\n2:22:18.680 --> 2:22:20.320\n is because they see the reality\n\n2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:22.960\n as they're multiplying matrices with NumPy\n\n2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:23.800\n or something like this, right?\n\n2:22:23.800 --> 2:22:25.440\n Yeah, and tweaking constants\n\n2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:27.800\n and hoping that the classifier fitness,\n\n2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:30.520\n for God's sakes, before the submission deadline\n\n2:22:30.520 --> 2:22:31.840\n actually gets above some,\n\n2:22:31.840 --> 2:22:36.100\n it feels like it's linear algebra and tedium, right?\n\n2:22:37.300 --> 2:22:39.320\n But anyways, I'm really convinced with his idea\n\n2:22:39.320 --> 2:22:40.720\n that once we understand better and better\n\n2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:42.240\n what's going on from a theory perspective,\n\n2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:44.700\n it's gonna make it into an engineering discipline.\n\n2:22:44.700 --> 2:22:47.240\n So in my mind, where we're gonna end up is,\n\n2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:50.280\n okay, forget these metaphors of neurons,\n\n2:22:50.280 --> 2:22:52.360\n and these things are gonna be put down\n\n2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:54.860\n into these mathematical kind of elegant equations,\n\n2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:57.600\n differentiable equations that just kind of work well,\n\n2:22:57.600 --> 2:22:58.920\n and then it's gonna be\n\n2:22:58.920 --> 2:23:02.280\n when I need a little bit of AI in this thing, plumbing.\n\n2:23:02.280 --> 2:23:05.220\n Like, let's get a little bit of a pattern recognizer\n\n2:23:05.220 --> 2:23:06.840\n with a noise module and let's connect.\n\n2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:08.280\n I mean, you know this feel better than me,\n\n2:23:08.280 --> 2:23:11.200\n so I don't know if this is like a reasonable prediction,\n\n2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:14.100\n but it's gonna become less inscrutable,\n\n2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:16.300\n and then it's gonna become more engineerable,\n\n2:23:16.300 --> 2:23:18.580\n and then we're gonna have AI in more things\n\n2:23:18.580 --> 2:23:20.580\n because we're gonna have a little bit more control\n\n2:23:20.580 --> 2:23:22.540\n over how we piece together\n\n2:23:22.540 --> 2:23:25.840\n these different classification black boxes.\n\n2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:28.040\n So one of the problems, and there might be\n\n2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:30.360\n some interesting parallels that you might provide intuition\n\n2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:32.600\n on is, you know, neural networks are very large,\n\n2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:35.000\n and they have a lot of, you know,\n\n2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:39.040\n we were talking about, you know, dynamic networks\n\n2:23:39.040 --> 2:23:41.860\n and distributed algorithms.\n\n2:23:41.860 --> 2:23:45.460\n One of the problems with the analysis of neural networks\n\n2:23:45.460 --> 2:23:48.680\n is, you know, you have a lot of nodes,\n\n2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:50.840\n and you have a lot of edges.\n\n2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:53.120\n To be able to interpret and to control different things\n\n2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:53.960\n is very difficult.\n\n2:23:53.960 --> 2:23:58.960\n There's fields in trying to figure out like mathematically\n\n2:23:59.040 --> 2:24:04.040\n how you form clean representations that are like,\n\n2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:07.680\n like one node contains all the information\n\n2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:08.700\n about a particular thing,\n\n2:24:08.700 --> 2:24:10.800\n and no other nodes is correlated to it.\n\n2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:13.680\n So like it has unique knowledge and like,\n\n2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:15.920\n but that ultimately boils down to trying\n\n2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:19.000\n to simplify this thing into,\n\n2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:20.600\n that goes against this very nature,\n\n2:24:20.600 --> 2:24:23.200\n which is like deeply connected,\n\n2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:27.600\n and like dynamic and just, you know,\n\n2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:30.400\n hundreds of millions, billions of nodes.\n\n2:24:30.400 --> 2:24:33.960\n And in a distributed sense, like when you zoom out,\n\n2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.440\n the thing has a representation\n\n2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:36.960\n and understanding of something,\n\n2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:38.520\n but the individual nodes are just doing\n\n2:24:38.520 --> 2:24:40.520\n their little exchanging thing.\n\n2:24:40.520 --> 2:24:42.800\n And it's the same thing with Stephen Wolfram\n\n2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:44.480\n when you talk about cellular automata,\n\n2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:46.340\n it's very difficult to do math\n\n2:24:46.340 --> 2:24:48.800\n when you have a huge collection of distributed things,\n\n2:24:48.800 --> 2:24:50.440\n each acting on their own.\n\n2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:54.760\n And it's almost like, it feels like it's almost impossible\n\n2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:58.200\n to do any kind of theoretical work in the traditional sense.\n\n2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:02.560\n It almost becomes completely like a biology,\n\n2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:06.080\n you become a biologist as opposed to a theoretician.\n\n2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:07.720\n You just study it experimentally.\n\n2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:10.720\n Yeah, I think that's the big question, I guess, right?\n\n2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:15.280\n Yeah, so is the large size and interconnectedness\n\n2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:18.360\n of the like a deep learning network fundamental\n\n2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:20.400\n to that task, or are we just not very good at it yet\n\n2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:23.360\n because we're using the wrong metaphor?\n\n2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:26.800\n I mean, the human brain learns with much fewer examples\n\n2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:30.400\n and with much less tuning of the whatever, whatever,\n\n2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:32.320\n whatever probably that requires to get\n\n2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.480\n those like deep mind networks up and running.\n\n2:25:34.480 --> 2:25:36.240\n But yeah, so I don't really know,\n\n2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:38.440\n but the one thing I have observed is that the, yeah,\n\n2:25:38.440 --> 2:25:42.080\n there's the mundane nature of some of the working\n\n2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:45.280\n with these models tends to lead people to think that,\n\n2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:49.200\n to do it like, it could be Skynet\n\n2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:53.120\n or it could be like a lot of pain to get the thermostat\n\n2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:54.520\n to do what we want it to do.\n\n2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.680\n And there's a lot of open questions in between there.\n\n2:25:56.680 --> 2:26:01.680\n And then of course, the distributed network\n\n2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:04.720\n of humans that use these systems.\n\n2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:07.560\n So like you can have the system itself,\n\n2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:10.040\n then your network, but you can also have like little\n\n2:26:10.040 --> 2:26:11.800\n algorithms controlling the behavior of humans,\n\n2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:14.120\n which is what you have with social networks.\n\n2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:17.520\n It's possible that a very, what is it, a toaster or whatever,\n\n2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:20.640\n the opposite of Skynet when taken at scale\n\n2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:22.680\n while used by individual humans and controlling\n\n2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:25.880\n their behavior can actually have the Skynet effect.\n\n2:26:25.880 --> 2:26:27.800\n So the scale there.\n\n2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:29.040\n We might have that now.\n\n2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:31.440\n We might have that now, we just don't know.\n\n2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:32.280\n As it's happening.\n\n2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:33.720\n Is Twitter creating a little mini Skynet?\n\n2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:35.080\n I mean, because of what happens,\n\n2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:38.000\n it twirls out ramifications in the world.\n\n2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.480\n And is it really that much different if it's a robot\n\n2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:44.480\n with tentacles or a bunch of servers that.\n\n2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:47.520\n Yeah, and the destructive effects could be,\n\n2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:51.000\n I mean, it could be political, but it could also be like,\n\n2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:54.640\n you could probably make an interesting case that the virus,\n\n2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:59.360\n the coronavirus spread on Twitter too,\n\n2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:00.760\n in the minds of people.\n\n2:27:00.760 --> 2:27:03.360\n Like the fear and the misinformation\n\n2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:06.360\n in some very interesting ways mixed up.\n\n2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:08.960\n And maybe this pandemic wasn't sufficiently dangerous\n\n2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:12.960\n to where that could have created a weird like an instability,\n\n2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:15.120\n but maybe other things might create instability.\n\n2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:17.000\n Like somebody, God forbid,\n\n2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:19.160\n detonates a nuclear weapon somewhere.\n\n2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:21.520\n And then maybe the destructive aspect of that\n\n2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:24.880\n would not as much be the military actions,\n\n2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:28.040\n but the way those news are spread on Twitter\n\n2:27:28.040 --> 2:27:29.280\n and the panic that creates.\n\n2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:30.400\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:32.320\n I mean, I think that's a great case study, right?\n\n2:27:32.320 --> 2:27:34.040\n Like what happened, not,\n\n2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:36.720\n but I'm not suggesting that Lexi go let off a nuclear bomb.\n\n2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:39.880\n I meant the coronavirus, but yeah,\n\n2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:43.000\n I think that's a really interesting case study.\n\n2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.040\n I'm interested in the counterfactual of 1995,\n\n2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:48.360\n like do the same virus in 1995.\n\n2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:50.440\n So first of all, it would have been,\n\n2:27:50.440 --> 2:27:53.560\n I get to hear whatever the nightly news,\n\n2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:54.480\n we'll talk about it.\n\n2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:57.280\n And then there'll be my local health board,\n\n2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:58.320\n we'll talk about it.\n\n2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:01.560\n That mitigation decisions would probably necessarily be\n\n2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:04.320\n very sort of localized.\n\n2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:05.480\n Okay, our community is trying to figure out\n\n2:28:05.480 --> 2:28:06.320\n what are we gonna do?\n\n2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:07.160\n What's gonna happen?\n\n2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.080\n Like we see this with schools,\n\n2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:10.400\n like where I grew up in New Jersey,\n\n2:28:10.400 --> 2:28:12.800\n there's very localized school districts.\n\n2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:15.040\n So even though they had sort of\n\n2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:16.280\n really bad viral numbers there,\n\n2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:18.320\n my school I grew up in has been open since the fall\n\n2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:20.160\n because it's very localized.\n\n2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:21.640\n It's like these teachers and these parents,\n\n2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:22.480\n what do we wanna do?\n\n2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:23.680\n What are we comfortable with?\n\n2:28:23.680 --> 2:28:26.440\n I live in a school district right now in Montgomery County\n\n2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:27.960\n that's a billion dollar a year budget,\n\n2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:29.960\n 150,000 kid school district.\n\n2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:32.680\n It just can't, it's closed because it's too.\n\n2:28:32.680 --> 2:28:33.880\n So I'm interested in that counterfactual.\n\n2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:36.400\n Yeah, so you have all this information moving around\n\n2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:39.160\n and then you have the effects on discourse\n\n2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:40.480\n that we were talking about earlier,\n\n2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:43.480\n that the Neil Postman style effects of Twitter,\n\n2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:46.160\n which shifts people into a sort of a dunk culture mindset\n\n2:28:46.160 --> 2:28:49.840\n of don't give an inch to the other team.\n\n2:28:49.840 --> 2:28:51.680\n And we're used to this and was fired up by politics\n\n2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:53.440\n and the unique attributes of Twitter.\n\n2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:54.720\n Now throw in the coronavirus\n\n2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.440\n and suddenly we see decades of public health knowledge,\n\n2:28:58.440 --> 2:29:00.920\n a lot of which was honed during the HIV epidemic,\n\n2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:02.280\n was thrown out the window\n\n2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:04.120\n because a lot of this was happening on Twitter\n\n2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:06.160\n and suddenly we had public health officials\n\n2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:08.680\n using a don't give an inch to the other team mindset\n\n2:29:08.680 --> 2:29:10.520\n of like, well, if we say this,\n\n2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:12.920\n that might validate something that was wrong over here\n\n2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:14.120\n and we need to, if we say this,\n\n2:29:14.120 --> 2:29:16.360\n then maybe like that'll stop them from doing this.\n\n2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:19.720\n That's like very Twittery in a way that in 1995\n\n2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:22.560\n is probably not the way public health officials\n\n2:29:22.560 --> 2:29:23.400\n would be thinking.\n\n2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:25.240\n Where now it's like, well, this is,\n\n2:29:25.240 --> 2:29:26.480\n if we said this about masks,\n\n2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:28.080\n but the other team said that about masks,\n\n2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:29.240\n we can't give an inch to this.\n\n2:29:29.240 --> 2:29:30.200\n So we gotta be careful.\n\n2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:31.600\n And like, we can't tell people it's okay\n\n2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:33.560\n after they're vaccinated because that might,\n\n2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:34.600\n we're giving them an inch on this\n\n2:29:34.600 --> 2:29:36.760\n and that's very Twittery in my mind, right?\n\n2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:39.360\n That is the impact of Twitter\n\n2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:40.600\n on the way we think about discourse,\n\n2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:41.600\n which is a dunking culture\n\n2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:43.120\n of don't give any inch to the other team\n\n2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:44.360\n and it's all about slam dunks\n\n2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:46.400\n where you're completely right and they're completely wrong.\n\n2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:49.000\n It's as a rhetorical strategy, it's incredibly simplistic,\n\n2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:50.760\n but it's also the way that we think right now\n\n2:29:50.760 --> 2:29:52.480\n about how we do debate.\n\n2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:56.320\n It combined terribly with election year pandemic.\n\n2:29:56.320 --> 2:29:58.240\n Yeah, election year pandemic.\n\n2:29:58.240 --> 2:30:00.040\n I wonder if we could do some smooth analysis.\n\n2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:01.800\n Let's run the simulation over a few times.\n\n2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:03.600\n A little bit of noise, yeah.\n\n2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:05.760\n See if it can dramatically change\n\n2:30:05.760 --> 2:30:07.240\n the behavior of the system.\n\n2:30:07.240 --> 2:30:09.040\n Okay, we talked about your love\n\n2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:11.760\n for proving that something is impossible.\n\n2:30:11.760 --> 2:30:14.360\n So there's quite a few still open problems\n\n2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:17.440\n and complexity of algorithms.\n\n2:30:17.440 --> 2:30:20.800\n So let me ask, does P equal NP?\n\n2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:22.040\n Probably not.\n\n2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:23.360\n Probably not.\n\n2:30:23.360 --> 2:30:28.360\n If P equals NP, what kind of,\n\n2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:32.440\n and you'd be really surprised somebody proves it.\n\n2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:33.960\n What would that proof look like\n\n2:30:33.960 --> 2:30:35.080\n and why would that even be?\n\n2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:36.480\n What would that mean?\n\n2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:38.320\n What would that proof look like?\n\n2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:40.840\n And what possible universe could P equals NP?\n\n2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:43.440\n Is there something in size that you could say there?\n\n2:30:43.440 --> 2:30:45.440\n It could be true.\n\n2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:47.280\n I mean, I'm not a complexity theorist,\n\n2:30:47.280 --> 2:30:49.520\n but every complexity theorist I know\n\n2:30:49.520 --> 2:30:51.440\n is convinced they're not equal\n\n2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:53.120\n and are basically not working on it anymore.\n\n2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:54.480\n I mean, there is a million dollars at stake\n\n2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:55.920\n if you can solve the proof.\n\n2:30:55.920 --> 2:30:57.800\n It's one of the millennium prizes.\n\n2:30:57.800 --> 2:31:00.840\n Okay, so here's how I think the P not equals NP proof\n\n2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:02.800\n is gonna eventually happen.\n\n2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:04.520\n I think it's gonna fall out\n\n2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:07.360\n and it's gonna be not super simple,\n\n2:31:07.360 --> 2:31:08.720\n but not as hard as people think,\n\n2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:12.200\n because my theory about a lot of theoretical computer science\n\n2:31:12.200 --> 2:31:13.960\n based on just some results I've done,\n\n2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:15.440\n so this is a huge extrapolation,\n\n2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:17.200\n is that a lot of what we're doing\n\n2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:20.840\n is just obfuscating deeper mathematics.\n\n2:31:20.840 --> 2:31:22.680\n So this happens to me a lot, not a lot,\n\n2:31:22.680 --> 2:31:24.320\n but it's happened to me a few times in my work\n\n2:31:24.320 --> 2:31:26.240\n where we obfuscate it because we say,\n\n2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:29.280\n well, there's an algorithm and it has this much memory\n\n2:31:29.280 --> 2:31:30.640\n and they're connected on a network\n\n2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:31.760\n and okay, here's our setup\n\n2:31:31.760 --> 2:31:34.480\n and now we're trying to see how fast it can solve a problem\n\n2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:35.960\n and people do bounds about it\n\n2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:37.040\n and then the end it turns out\n\n2:31:37.040 --> 2:31:39.320\n that we were just obfuscating some underlying\n\n2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:43.520\n mathematical thing that already existed, right?\n\n2:31:43.520 --> 2:31:44.400\n So this has happened to me.\n\n2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:47.400\n I had this paper I was quite fond of a while ago.\n\n2:31:47.400 --> 2:31:50.560\n It was looking at this problem called contention resolution\n\n2:31:50.560 --> 2:31:54.520\n where you put an unknown set of people on a shared channel\n\n2:31:54.520 --> 2:31:55.720\n and they're trying to break symmetry.\n\n2:31:55.720 --> 2:31:57.720\n So it's like an ethernet, whatever.\n\n2:31:57.720 --> 2:31:58.920\n Only one person can use it at a time.\n\n2:31:58.920 --> 2:31:59.760\n You try to break symmetry.\n\n2:31:59.760 --> 2:32:02.360\n There's all these bounds people have proven over the years\n\n2:32:02.360 --> 2:32:05.040\n about how long it takes to do this, right?\n\n2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:07.440\n And like I discovered at some point,\n\n2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:12.440\n there's this one combinatorial result from the early 1990s.\n\n2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:15.440\n All of these lower bound proofs all come from this\n\n2:32:15.440 --> 2:32:16.840\n and in fact, it improved a lot of them\n\n2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:17.680\n and simplified a lot.\n\n2:32:17.680 --> 2:32:19.800\n You could put it all in one paper.\n\n2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:20.640\n It's like, are we really?\n\n2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:21.920\n And then, okay, so this new paper\n\n2:32:21.920 --> 2:32:24.200\n that I submitted a couple of weeks ago,\n\n2:32:24.200 --> 2:32:26.440\n I found you could take some of these same lower bound proofs\n\n2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:28.080\n for this contention resolution problem.\n\n2:32:28.080 --> 2:32:29.720\n You could reprove them.\n\n2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:32.280\n Using Shannon's source code theorem\n\n2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:34.080\n that actually when you're breaking contention,\n\n2:32:34.080 --> 2:32:37.360\n what you're really doing is building a code over,\n\n2:32:38.360 --> 2:32:40.520\n if you have a distribution on the network sizes,\n\n2:32:40.520 --> 2:32:41.720\n it's a code over that source.\n\n2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:44.440\n And if you plug in a high entropy information source\n\n2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:47.480\n and plug in from 1948, the source code theorem\n\n2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:48.720\n that says on a noiseless channel,\n\n2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:51.080\n you can't send things at a faster rate\n\n2:32:51.080 --> 2:32:52.440\n than the entropy allows,\n\n2:32:52.440 --> 2:32:54.440\n the exact same lower bounds fall back out again, right?\n\n2:32:54.440 --> 2:32:55.840\n So like this type of thing happens.\n\n2:32:55.840 --> 2:32:58.720\n There's some famous lower bounds and distributed algorithms\n\n2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:01.600\n that turned out to all be algebraic topology\n\n2:33:01.600 --> 2:33:02.760\n underneath the covers.\n\n2:33:02.760 --> 2:33:05.560\n And they won the Girdle Prize for working on that.\n\n2:33:05.560 --> 2:33:08.400\n So my sense is what's gonna happen is at some point,\n\n2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:11.000\n someone really smart to be very exciting\n\n2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:14.760\n is gonna realize there's some sort of other representation\n\n2:33:14.760 --> 2:33:16.840\n of what's going on with these Turing machines\n\n2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:18.680\n trying to sort of efficiently compute.\n\n2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:22.120\n And there'll be an existing mathematical result\n\n2:33:22.120 --> 2:33:23.880\n that apply.\n\n2:33:23.880 --> 2:33:25.360\n Someone or something, I guess.\n\n2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:28.040\n It could be AI theorem provers kind of thing.\n\n2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:28.880\n It could be, yeah.\n\n2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:30.520\n I mean, not a, well, yeah.\n\n2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:31.760\n I mean, there's theorem provers,\n\n2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:35.440\n like what that means now, which is not fun.\n\n2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:37.040\n It's just a bunch of...\n\n2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:39.280\n Very carefully formulated postulates that,\n\n2:33:39.280 --> 2:33:41.320\n but I take your point, yeah.\n\n2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:42.720\n Yeah, so, okay.\n\n2:33:44.520 --> 2:33:45.920\n On a small tangent on that,\n\n2:33:45.920 --> 2:33:49.000\n then you're kind of implying that mathematics,\n\n2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:52.520\n it almost feels like a kind of weird evolutionary tree\n\n2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:55.400\n that ultimately leads back to some kind of ancestral,\n\n2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:58.840\n few fundamental ideas that all are just like,\n\n2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:00.360\n they're all somehow connected.\n\n2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:02.960\n In that sense, do you think\n\n2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:07.000\n math is fundamental to our universe\n\n2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:10.960\n and we're just like slowly trying to understand\n\n2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:14.280\n these patterns or is it discovered?\n\n2:34:15.240 --> 2:34:19.920\n Or is it just a little game that we play amongst ourselves\n\n2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.680\n to try to fit little patterns to the world?\n\n2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:24.880\n Yeah, that's the question, right?\n\n2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:26.840\n That's the physicist question.\n\n2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:29.120\n I mean, I'm probably, I'm in the discovered camp,\n\n2:34:29.120 --> 2:34:30.720\n but I don't do theoretical physics.\n\n2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:32.400\n So I know they have a,\n\n2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:35.200\n they feel like they have a stronger claim\n\n2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:37.280\n to answering that question.\n\n2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:38.480\n But everything comes back to it.\n\n2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:39.520\n Everything comes back to it.\n\n2:34:39.520 --> 2:34:40.680\n I mean, all the physics,\n\n2:34:40.680 --> 2:34:43.920\n the fact that the universe is, well, okay.\n\n2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:47.200\n It's a complicated question.\n\n2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:49.280\n So how often do you think,\n\n2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:53.040\n how deeply does this result describe\n\n2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:55.720\n the fundamental reality of nature?\n\n2:34:57.080 --> 2:34:59.720\n So the reason I hesitated,\n\n2:34:59.720 --> 2:35:01.080\n because it's something I'm,\n\n2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:03.080\n I taught this seminar and did a little work\n\n2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:05.000\n on what are called biological algorithms.\n\n2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.480\n So there's this notion of,\n\n2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:14.360\n so physicists use mathematics to explain the universe, right?\n\n2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:18.200\n And it was unreasonable that mathematics works so well.\n\n2:35:18.200 --> 2:35:19.760\n All these differential equations,\n\n2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:21.680\n why does that explain all we need to know\n\n2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:23.040\n about thermodynamics and gravity\n\n2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:24.240\n and all these types of things?\n\n2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:25.560\n Well, there's this movement\n\n2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:28.680\n within the intersection of computer science and biology,\n\n2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:31.160\n just kind of Wolframium, I guess, really,\n\n2:35:31.160 --> 2:35:35.040\n that algorithms can be very explanatory, right?\n\n2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:39.440\n Like if you're trying to explain parsimoniously\n\n2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:41.840\n something about like an ant colony or something like this,\n\n2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:43.160\n you're not going to,\n\n2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:45.840\n ultimately it's not gonna be explained as a equation,\n\n2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:46.840\n like a physics equation.\n\n2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:48.280\n It's gonna be explained by an algorithm.\n\n2:35:48.280 --> 2:35:51.920\n So like this algorithm run distributedly\n\n2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:53.240\n is going to explain the behavior.\n\n2:35:53.240 --> 2:35:56.160\n So that's mathematical, but not quite mathematical,\n\n2:35:56.160 --> 2:35:57.640\n but it is if you think about an algorithm\n\n2:35:57.640 --> 2:35:58.680\n like a Lambda calculus,\n\n2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:01.040\n which brings you back to the world of mathematics.\n\n2:36:01.040 --> 2:36:01.960\n So I'm thinking out loud here,\n\n2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:06.960\n but basically abstract math is sort of like\n\n2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:10.440\n unreasonably effective at explaining a lot of things.\n\n2:36:10.440 --> 2:36:11.840\n And that's just what I feel like I glimpse.\n\n2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:14.960\n I'm not like a super well known theoretician.\n\n2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:16.960\n I don't have really famous results.\n\n2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:21.880\n So even as a sort of middling career theoretician,\n\n2:36:21.880 --> 2:36:25.920\n I keep encountering this where we think we're solving\n\n2:36:25.920 --> 2:36:28.640\n some problem about computers and algorithms,\n\n2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:31.040\n and it's some much deeper underlying math.\n\n2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:33.240\n It's Shannon, but Shannon is entropy,\n\n2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:36.840\n but entropy was really goes all the way back\n\n2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:38.380\n to whatever it was,\n\n2:36:38.380 --> 2:36:40.680\n Boyle or all the way back to looking at the early physics.\n\n2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:44.960\n And it's, anyways, to me, I think it's amazing.\n\n2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:47.760\n Yeah, but it could be the flip side of that could be\n\n2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:49.480\n just our brains draw so much pleasure\n\n2:36:49.480 --> 2:36:53.240\n from the deriving generalized theories\n\n2:36:53.240 --> 2:36:56.680\n and simplifying the universe that we just naturally see\n\n2:36:56.680 --> 2:36:58.680\n that kind of simplicity in everything.\n\n2:36:58.680 --> 2:37:01.880\n Yeah, so that's the whole Newton to Einstein, right?\n\n2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:03.600\n So you can say this must be right\n\n2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:04.960\n because it's so predictive.\n\n2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:06.440\n Well, it's not quite predictive\n\n2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:07.720\n because Mercury wobbles a little bit,\n\n2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:08.680\n but I think we have it set\n\n2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:10.780\n and then you turn out, no, Einstein.\n\n2:37:10.780 --> 2:37:13.920\n And then you get Bohr like, no, not Einstein.\n\n2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:15.160\n It's actually statistical.\n\n2:37:15.160 --> 2:37:16.600\n And yeah, so that would be interesting.\n\n2:37:16.600 --> 2:37:17.800\n It's hard to also know\n\n2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:20.320\n where a smooth analysis fits into all that\n\n2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:21.560\n or a little bit of noise.\n\n2:37:21.560 --> 2:37:25.720\n Like you can say something very clean about a system\n\n2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:27.440\n and then a little bit of noise,\n\n2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:29.880\n like the average case is actually very different.\n\n2:37:29.880 --> 2:37:31.720\n And so, I mean, that's where\n\n2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:32.920\n the quantum mechanics comes in.\n\n2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:36.200\n It's like, ugh, why does it have to be randomness in this?\n\n2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:38.720\n Yeah, I would have to do this complex statistics.\n\n2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:39.560\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:42.600\n So to be determined.\n\n2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:44.000\n Yeah, that'll be my next book.\n\n2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:45.600\n That'd be ambitious.\n\n2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.040\n The fundamental core of reality, comma,\n\n2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:52.440\n and some advice for being more productive at work.\n\n2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:55.280\n Can I ask you just,\n\n2:37:55.280 --> 2:37:57.120\n if it's possible to do an overview\n\n2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:00.480\n and just some brief comments of wisdom\n\n2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:02.960\n on the process of publishing a book,\n\n2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:04.120\n what's that process entail?\n\n2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:05.480\n What are the different options\n\n2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:07.000\n and what's your recommendation\n\n2:38:08.440 --> 2:38:12.440\n for somebody that wants to write a book like yours,\n\n2:38:12.440 --> 2:38:14.840\n a nonfiction book that discovers\n\n2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:17.800\n something interesting about this world?\n\n2:38:17.800 --> 2:38:22.800\n So what I usually advise is follow the process as is.\n\n2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:27.280\n Don't try to reinvent.\n\n2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:31.480\n I think that happens a lot where you'll try to reinvent\n\n2:38:31.480 --> 2:38:33.000\n the way the publishing industry should work.\n\n2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:36.280\n Like this is kind of not like in a business model ways,\n\n2:38:36.280 --> 2:38:38.200\n but just like, this is what I want to do.\n\n2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:39.680\n I want to write a thousand words a day\n\n2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:41.800\n and I want to do this and I'm gonna put it on the internet\n\n2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:44.680\n and the publishing industry is very specific\n\n2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:46.320\n about how it works.\n\n2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:47.880\n And so like when I got started writing books,\n\n2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:48.840\n which at a very young age,\n\n2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:52.320\n so I sold my first book at the age of 21.\n\n2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:56.320\n The way I did that is I found a family friend\n\n2:38:56.320 --> 2:38:58.920\n that was an agent and I said,\n\n2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:00.560\n I'm not trying to make you be my agent.\n\n2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:02.240\n Just explain to me how this works.\n\n2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:03.360\n Not just how the world works,\n\n2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:06.680\n but give me the hard truth about how would a 21 year old,\n\n2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:08.800\n under what conditions could a 21 year old sell a book\n\n2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:09.640\n and what would that look like?\n\n2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:10.600\n And she just explained it to me.\n\n2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:12.400\n You know, you have to do this and have to be a subject\n\n2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:14.040\n that it made sense for you to write.\n\n2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:15.360\n And you would have to do this type of writing\n\n2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:17.600\n for the publications to validate it and blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:18.760\n And you have to get the agent first.\n\n2:39:18.760 --> 2:39:22.280\n And I learned the whole game plan and then I executed.\n\n2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:24.720\n And so the rough game plan is with nonfiction,\n\n2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:26.480\n you get the agent first\n\n2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:28.760\n and the agent's gonna sell it to the publishers.\n\n2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:30.240\n So like you're never sending something directly\n\n2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:31.080\n to the publishers.\n\n2:39:31.080 --> 2:39:34.320\n In nonfiction, you're not writing the book first, right?\n\n2:39:34.320 --> 2:39:37.280\n You're gonna get an advance from the publisher once sold\n\n2:39:37.280 --> 2:39:40.200\n and then you're gonna do the primary writing of the book.\n\n2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:42.720\n In fact, it will, in most circumstances, hurt you\n\n2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:43.560\n if you've already written it.\n\n2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:44.400\n If you've already written it.\n\n2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:45.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:47.200\n So you're trying to sell, well, I guess the agent,\n\n2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:48.040\n first you sell it to the agent\n\n2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:50.120\n and then the agent sells it to the publishers.\n\n2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:52.360\n It's much easier to get an agent than a book deal.\n\n2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:54.440\n So the thought is, if you can't get an agent,\n\n2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:55.280\n then why would you?\n\n2:39:55.280 --> 2:39:57.880\n So you start with, and also the way this works\n\n2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:00.480\n with a good agent is they know all the editors\n\n2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:01.520\n and they have lunch with the editors\n\n2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:02.360\n and they're always just like,\n\n2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:03.240\n okay, what projects do you have coming?\n\n2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:04.080\n What are you looking for?\n\n2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:04.900\n Here's one of my authors.\n\n2:40:04.900 --> 2:40:06.080\n That's the way all these deals happen.\n\n2:40:06.080 --> 2:40:09.520\n It's not, you're not emailing a manuscript to a slush pile.\n\n2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:12.320\n Yeah, and so first of all, the agent takes a percentage\n\n2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:14.680\n and then the publishers, this is where the process comes in.\n\n2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:17.880\n They take also a cut that's probably ridiculous.\n\n2:40:17.880 --> 2:40:21.000\n So if you try to reinvent the system,\n\n2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:22.800\n you'll probably be frustrated by the percentage\n\n2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:25.320\n that everyone takes relative to how much bureaucracy\n\n2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:28.240\n and efficiency ridiculousness there is in the system.\n\n2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:31.640\n Your recommendation is like, you're just one ant.\n\n2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:34.400\n Stop trying to build your own ant colony.\n\n2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:36.840\n Well, or if you create your own process\n\n2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:38.440\n for how it should work,\n\n2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:39.480\n the book's not gonna get published.\n\n2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:40.840\n So there's the separate question,\n\n2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:41.920\n the economic question of like,\n\n2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:44.560\n should I create my own, like self publish it\n\n2:40:44.560 --> 2:40:45.400\n or do something like that?\n\n2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:47.080\n But putting that aside,\n\n2:40:47.080 --> 2:40:48.860\n there's a lot of people I encounter\n\n2:40:48.860 --> 2:40:51.320\n that wanna publish a book with a main publisher,\n\n2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:54.080\n but they invent their own rules for how it works, right?\n\n2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:56.400\n So then the alternative though is self publishing\n\n2:40:56.400 --> 2:41:00.440\n and the downside, there's a lot of downsides.\n\n2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:03.080\n It's almost like publishing an opinion piece\n\n2:41:03.080 --> 2:41:05.560\n in the New York Times versus writing on a blog.\n\n2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:09.520\n There's no reason why writing a blog post on Medium\n\n2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:13.560\n can't get way more attention and legitimacy\n\n2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:16.800\n and long lasting prestige than a New York Times article.\n\n2:41:16.800 --> 2:41:18.920\n But nevertheless, for most people,\n\n2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:21.220\n writing in a prestigious newspaper,\n\n2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:25.820\n quote unquote prestigious, is just easier.\n\n2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:29.060\n And well, and depends on your goal.\n\n2:41:29.060 --> 2:41:32.240\n So, you know, like I push you towards a big publisher\n\n2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:36.080\n because I think your goal, it's huge ideas, you want impact.\n\n2:41:36.080 --> 2:41:37.920\n You're gonna have more impact.\n\n2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:39.880\n Even though, like actually,\n\n2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:41.880\n so there's different ways to measure impact, right?\n\n2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:42.800\n In the world of ideas.\n\n2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:44.200\n In the world of ideas.\n\n2:41:44.200 --> 2:41:46.480\n And also, yeah, in the world of ideas,\n\n2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:48.960\n it's kind of like the clubhouse thing now,\n\n2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:51.200\n even if the audience is not large,\n\n2:41:51.200 --> 2:41:53.600\n the people in the audience are very interesting.\n\n2:41:54.760 --> 2:41:56.880\n It's like the conversation feels like\n\n2:41:56.880 --> 2:42:01.500\n that has long lasting impact among the people\n\n2:42:01.500 --> 2:42:03.720\n in different and disparate industries\n\n2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:06.540\n that are also then starting their own conversations\n\n2:42:06.540 --> 2:42:07.380\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:42:07.380 --> 2:42:09.040\n Yeah, because you have other,\n\n2:42:09.040 --> 2:42:11.080\n so like self publishing a book,\n\n2:42:12.160 --> 2:42:13.260\n the goals that would solve,\n\n2:42:13.260 --> 2:42:15.340\n you have much better ways of getting to those goals,\n\n2:42:15.340 --> 2:42:16.220\n might be part of it, right?\n\n2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:17.880\n So if there's the financial aspect\n\n2:42:17.880 --> 2:42:19.560\n of well, you get to keep more of it,\n\n2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:22.420\n I mean, the podcast is probably gonna crush\n\n2:42:22.420 --> 2:42:23.600\n what the book's gonna do anyways, right?\n\n2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:27.240\n Yeah, if it's, I wanna get directly\n\n2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:28.760\n to certain audiences or crowds,\n\n2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:30.560\n it might be harder through a traditional publisher.\n\n2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:32.520\n There's better ways to talk to those crowds.\n\n2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:34.680\n It could be on clubhouse with all these new technologies,\n\n2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:36.880\n self published books not gonna be the most effective way\n\n2:42:36.880 --> 2:42:39.200\n to find your way to a new crowd.\n\n2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:40.560\n But if the idea is like, I wanna have a,\n\n2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:43.600\n leave a dent in the world of ideas,\n\n2:42:43.600 --> 2:42:47.200\n then to have a vulnerable old publisher,\n\n2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:49.140\n put out your book in a nice hardcover\n\n2:42:49.140 --> 2:42:52.760\n and do the things they do, that goes a long way.\n\n2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:53.700\n And they do do a lot.\n\n2:42:53.700 --> 2:42:55.680\n I mean, it's very difficult actually.\n\n2:42:55.680 --> 2:42:57.800\n There's so much involved in putting together a book.\n\n2:42:57.800 --> 2:42:59.160\n They get books into bookstores\n\n2:42:59.160 --> 2:42:59.980\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:42:59.980 --> 2:43:02.560\n And from an efficiency standpoint,\n\n2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:03.800\n I mean, just the time involved\n\n2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:05.600\n in trying to do this yourself is.\n\n2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:06.800\n They have a process, right?\n\n2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:08.440\n Like you said, they have a process.\n\n2:43:08.440 --> 2:43:09.280\n They've got a process.\n\n2:43:09.280 --> 2:43:11.080\n I mean, I know like Jocko did this recently,\n\n2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:13.080\n he started his own imprint and I have a couple other.\n\n2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:15.040\n But it's a huge overhead.\n\n2:43:15.040 --> 2:43:17.240\n I mean, if you run a business and you,\n\n2:43:17.240 --> 2:43:19.300\n so like Jocko is a good case study, right?\n\n2:43:19.300 --> 2:43:22.440\n So he got fed up with Simon and Schuster\n\n2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:23.600\n dragging their feet and said,\n\n2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:25.240\n I'm gonna start my own imprint then,\n\n2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:28.120\n if you're not gonna publish my kid's book.\n\n2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:30.800\n But he, what does he do, he runs businesses, right?\n\n2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:32.760\n So I think in his world, like I already run,\n\n2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:34.900\n I'm a partner in whatever, in Origin,\n\n2:43:34.900 --> 2:43:35.740\n and I have this and that.\n\n2:43:35.740 --> 2:43:37.720\n And so it's like, yeah, we can run businesses.\n\n2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:38.560\n That's what we know how to do.\n\n2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:39.400\n That's what I do.\n\n2:43:39.400 --> 2:43:40.520\n I run businesses, I have people.\n\n2:43:40.520 --> 2:43:43.160\n But for like you or I, we don't run businesses.\n\n2:43:43.160 --> 2:43:44.000\n It'd be terrible.\n\n2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:47.420\n Yeah, well, especially these kinds of businesses, right?\n\n2:43:47.420 --> 2:43:49.600\n So I do wanna launch a business with very different\n\n2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:50.440\n technology business.\n\n2:43:50.440 --> 2:43:51.280\n It's very different.\n\n2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:53.320\n Yeah, it's very, very different, yeah.\n\n2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:55.760\n I mean, this is like, okay, I need copy editors\n\n2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:58.680\n and graphic book binders, and I need to contract\n\n2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:00.760\n with the printer, but oh, the printer doesn't have slots.\n\n2:44:00.760 --> 2:44:02.800\n And so now I have to try to, I mean, it's.\n\n2:44:02.800 --> 2:44:05.720\n I get so, I need to shut this off in my room,\n\n2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:07.220\n but I get so frustrated when the system\n\n2:44:07.220 --> 2:44:08.620\n could clearly be improved.\n\n2:44:08.620 --> 2:44:10.480\n It's the thing that you're mentioning.\n\n2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:12.480\n It's like, this is so inefficient.\n\n2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:15.640\n Every time I go to the DMV or something like that,\n\n2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:18.760\n you think like, ah, this could be done so much better.\n\n2:44:18.760 --> 2:44:23.760\n But, and the same thing as the worry with an editor,\n\n2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:26.120\n which I guess would come from the publisher,\n\n2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:31.120\n like who would, how much supervision on your book\n\n2:44:31.260 --> 2:44:34.280\n did you receive like, hey, do you think this is too long?\n\n2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:36.280\n Or do you think the title, like title,\n\n2:44:36.280 --> 2:44:39.200\n how much choice do you have in the title, in the cover,\n\n2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:41.200\n in the presentation and the branding\n\n2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:42.040\n and all that kind of stuff?\n\n2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:43.860\n Yeah, I mean, all of it depends, right?\n\n2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:48.040\n So when it comes on the relationship with the editor\n\n2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:49.520\n on the writing, it depends on the editor\n\n2:44:49.520 --> 2:44:51.640\n and it depends on you.\n\n2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:54.160\n So like at this point, I'm on my seventh book\n\n2:44:54.160 --> 2:44:56.920\n and I write for a lot of major publications.\n\n2:44:56.920 --> 2:45:00.240\n And at this point I have what I feel like is a voice\n\n2:45:00.240 --> 2:45:03.920\n and a level of craft that I'm very comfortable with, right?\n\n2:45:03.920 --> 2:45:06.020\n So my editor is not gonna be,\n\n2:45:06.020 --> 2:45:07.100\n she kind of is gonna trust me\n\n2:45:07.100 --> 2:45:08.320\n and it's gonna be more big picture.\n\n2:45:08.320 --> 2:45:10.880\n Like I'm losing the thread here\n\n2:45:10.880 --> 2:45:12.840\n or this seems like it could be longer.\n\n2:45:12.840 --> 2:45:15.400\n Whereas the first book I wrote when I was 21,\n\n2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:19.520\n I had notes such as you start a lot of sentences with so,\n\n2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:20.960\n you don't use any contractions\n\n2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:22.360\n because I've been doing scientific writing,\n\n2:45:22.360 --> 2:45:23.440\n we don't use contractions.\n\n2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:25.200\n Like you should probably use contractions.\n\n2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:27.600\n It was way more, I had to go back\n\n2:45:27.600 --> 2:45:29.640\n and rewrite the whole thing, yeah.\n\n2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:31.960\n But ultimately the recommendation,\n\n2:45:31.960 --> 2:45:33.720\n I mean, we talked offline and sort of,\n\n2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:36.840\n I was thinking loosely, not really sure,\n\n2:45:36.840 --> 2:45:37.960\n but I was thinking of writing a book\n\n2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:40.640\n and there's a kind of desire to go self publishing,\n\n2:45:40.640 --> 2:45:42.040\n not for financial reasons.\n\n2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:43.360\n And the money can be good by the way, right?\n\n2:45:43.360 --> 2:45:48.080\n I mean, it's very power law type distributed, right?\n\n2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:49.840\n So the money on a hardcover is somewhere\n\n2:45:49.840 --> 2:45:52.040\n between one or $2 a book.\n\n2:45:52.040 --> 2:45:53.880\n So the thing is, I personally don't.\n\n2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:56.040\n But then you give up 15% to the agent, so.\n\n2:45:56.040 --> 2:45:57.420\n I personally don't care about money\n\n2:45:57.420 --> 2:45:58.620\n as I've mentioned before,\n\n2:45:58.620 --> 2:46:02.200\n but I for some reason really don't like spending money\n\n2:46:03.280 --> 2:46:05.800\n on things that are not worth it.\n\n2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:08.040\n Like I don't care if I get money,\n\n2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:11.480\n I just don't like spending money on like feeding a system\n\n2:46:11.480 --> 2:46:12.840\n that's inefficient.\n\n2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:14.480\n It's like I'm contributing to the problem.\n\n2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:16.080\n That's my biggest problem.\n\n2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:18.640\n Right, so you're worried about the inefficiencies\n\n2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:19.920\n of the opportunity.\n\n2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:21.320\n Yeah, the fact that.\n\n2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:23.080\n Like the overheads, the number of people involved.\n\n2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:24.040\n Or the overheads.\n\n2:46:24.040 --> 2:46:26.320\n The emails again.\n\n2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:30.280\n The fact that they have this way of speaking,\n\n2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:32.360\n which I'm allergic to many people,\n\n2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:34.640\n like that's very marketing speak.\n\n2:46:34.640 --> 2:46:36.180\n Like you could tell they've been having\n\n2:46:36.180 --> 2:46:37.760\n Zoom meetings all day.\n\n2:46:37.760 --> 2:46:42.760\n It's like as opposed to a sort of creative collaborators\n\n2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:45.680\n that are like also a little bit crazy.\n\n2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:46.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:48.160\n I suppose some of that is finding the right people.\n\n2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:48.980\n Finding the right people.\n\n2:46:48.980 --> 2:46:49.820\n That's what I would say.\n\n2:46:49.820 --> 2:46:51.120\n I'd say there's definitely,\n\n2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:52.760\n and maybe it's just good fortune.\n\n2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:55.580\n Good fortune in terms of like my agents and editors\n\n2:46:55.580 --> 2:46:56.420\n I've worked with.\n\n2:46:56.420 --> 2:47:01.080\n There's really good people who see the vision\n\n2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:02.400\n are smart or incredibly literary.\n\n2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:03.220\n And they actually help you.\n\n2:47:03.220 --> 2:47:04.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:05.080\n Like psychologically.\n\n2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:06.800\n Yeah, I had a great editor when I was first moving\n\n2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:08.720\n into hardcover books, for example.\n\n2:47:08.720 --> 2:47:12.280\n It was my first big book advance\n\n2:47:12.280 --> 2:47:14.640\n and my first sort of big deal\n\n2:47:14.640 --> 2:47:16.640\n and he was like a senior editor\n\n2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:19.200\n and it was very useful, you know?\n\n2:47:19.200 --> 2:47:21.360\n He was like, we had a lot of long talks, right?\n\n2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:23.080\n I was, so this was my fourth book,\n\n2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:25.080\n So Good They Can't Ignore You was my first,\n\n2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:26.660\n my big hardcover idea book.\n\n2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:29.320\n And we had a lot of talks,\n\n2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:31.060\n like even before I started writing it,\n\n2:47:31.060 --> 2:47:34.040\n just let's talk about books and his philosophy.\n\n2:47:34.040 --> 2:47:35.560\n He'd been in the business for a long time.\n\n2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:37.080\n He was the head of the imprint.\n\n2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:38.480\n It was useful.\n\n2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:41.000\n Yeah, but I mean, the other frustrating thing\n\n2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:42.600\n is how long the whole thing takes.\n\n2:47:42.600 --> 2:47:44.240\n Makes a long time.\n\n2:47:44.240 --> 2:47:45.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:46.320\n But I suppose that's, you just have to accept that.\n\n2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:48.000\n Well, yeah, I handed in this manuscript\n\n2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.400\n for the book that comes out now,\n\n2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:52.320\n like when this, I handed it in,\n\n2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:54.440\n I mean, over the summer, like during the pandemic.\n\n2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:56.440\n So it's not, it's not terrible, right?\n\n2:47:56.440 --> 2:47:57.920\n And we were editing during the pandemic\n\n2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:00.460\n and I finished it in the spring.\n\n2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:02.240\n We've talked most of the day,\n\n2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:03.640\n except for a little bit computer science,\n\n2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:05.680\n most of the day about a productive life.\n\n2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:11.220\n How does love, friendship and family fit into that?\n\n2:48:11.220 --> 2:48:16.180\n Is there, do you find that there's a tension?\n\n2:48:17.580 --> 2:48:19.620\n Is it possible for relationships\n\n2:48:19.620 --> 2:48:22.460\n to energize the whole process, to benefit?\n\n2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:25.420\n Or is it ultimately a trade off?\n\n2:48:25.420 --> 2:48:30.040\n But because life is short and ultimately\n\n2:48:30.040 --> 2:48:32.780\n we seek happiness, not productivity,\n\n2:48:32.780 --> 2:48:35.060\n that we have to accept that tension.\n\n2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:36.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:48:36.300 --> 2:48:39.220\n I mean, I think relationships is the,\n\n2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:41.540\n that's the whole deal.\n\n2:48:41.540 --> 2:48:43.780\n Like I thought about this the other day,\n\n2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:44.700\n I don't know what the context was.\n\n2:48:44.700 --> 2:48:46.180\n I was thinking about if I was gonna give\n\n2:48:46.180 --> 2:48:49.060\n like an advice speech, like a commencement address\n\n2:48:49.060 --> 2:48:51.700\n or like giving advice to young people.\n\n2:48:51.700 --> 2:48:56.100\n And like the big question I have for young people is\n\n2:48:56.100 --> 2:48:58.580\n if they haven't already, bad things are gonna happen\n\n2:48:58.580 --> 2:49:01.820\n that you don't control, so what's the plan, right?\n\n2:49:01.820 --> 2:49:03.580\n Like, let's start figuring that out now\n\n2:49:03.580 --> 2:49:05.620\n because it's not all, you know,\n\n2:49:05.620 --> 2:49:07.460\n some people get off better than others,\n\n2:49:07.460 --> 2:49:09.980\n but eventually stuff happens, right?\n\n2:49:09.980 --> 2:49:11.900\n You get sick, something falls apart,\n\n2:49:11.900 --> 2:49:16.020\n the economy craters, someone you know dies,\n\n2:49:16.020 --> 2:49:19.020\n like all sorts of bad stuff is gonna happen, right?\n\n2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:20.660\n So how are we gonna do this?\n\n2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:23.100\n Like, how do we like live life when life is hard?\n\n2:49:23.100 --> 2:49:25.780\n And in ways that is unfair and unpredictable,\n\n2:49:25.780 --> 2:49:27.860\n then relationships is the,\n\n2:49:27.860 --> 2:49:30.420\n that's the buffer for all of that.\n\n2:49:30.420 --> 2:49:31.540\n Cause we're wired for it, right?\n\n2:49:31.540 --> 2:49:34.160\n I went down this rabbit hole with digital minimalism.\n\n2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:35.420\n I went down this huge rabbit hole\n\n2:49:35.420 --> 2:49:38.780\n about the human brain and sociality.\n\n2:49:38.780 --> 2:49:39.780\n It's all we're wired to do.\n\n2:49:39.780 --> 2:49:41.260\n It's like all of our brain is for this.\n\n2:49:41.260 --> 2:49:43.340\n Like everything, all of our mechanisms,\n\n2:49:43.340 --> 2:49:46.380\n everything is made to service the social connections\n\n2:49:46.380 --> 2:49:47.620\n because it's what kept you alive, you know?\n\n2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:49.660\n I mean, you had the, your tribal connections\n\n2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:52.020\n is how you didn't starve during a famine,\n\n2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:54.660\n people would share food, et cetera.\n\n2:49:54.660 --> 2:49:56.180\n And so you can't neglect that.\n\n2:49:56.180 --> 2:49:58.380\n And it's like everything and people feel it, right?\n\n2:49:58.380 --> 2:50:00.020\n Like there's no, our social networks\n\n2:50:00.020 --> 2:50:01.700\n are hooked up to the pain center.\n\n2:50:01.700 --> 2:50:03.940\n That's why it feels so terrible when you miss someone\n\n2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:05.300\n or like someone dies or something, right?\n\n2:50:05.300 --> 2:50:07.660\n That's like how seriously we take it.\n\n2:50:07.660 --> 2:50:09.260\n There's a pretty accepted theory\n\n2:50:09.260 --> 2:50:10.480\n that the default mode network,\n\n2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:12.540\n like a lot of what the default mode network is doing.\n\n2:50:12.540 --> 2:50:14.980\n So that's sort of the default state our brain goes into\n\n2:50:14.980 --> 2:50:16.260\n when we're not doing something in particular\n\n2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:19.540\n is practicing sociality, practicing interactions thing,\n\n2:50:19.540 --> 2:50:22.540\n because it's so crucial to what we do.\n\n2:50:22.540 --> 2:50:25.100\n It's like at the core of human thriving.\n\n2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:26.340\n So I've more recently,\n\n2:50:26.340 --> 2:50:29.260\n the way I think about it is like relationships first.\n\n2:50:29.260 --> 2:50:30.100\n Okay.\n\n2:50:30.100 --> 2:50:31.560\n Given that foundation of putting like,\n\n2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:33.180\n and I don't think we put nearly enough time into it.\n\n2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:36.060\n I worry that social media is reducing relationships,\n\n2:50:36.060 --> 2:50:37.440\n strong relationships.\n\n2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:39.180\n Strong relationships where you're sacrificing\n\n2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:42.860\n non trivial time and attention and resources,\n\n2:50:42.860 --> 2:50:44.600\n whatever on behalf of other people.\n\n2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:46.420\n That's the net that is gonna allow you\n\n2:50:46.420 --> 2:50:48.260\n to get through anything.\n\n2:50:48.260 --> 2:50:50.140\n Then, all right.\n\n2:50:50.140 --> 2:50:53.580\n Now what do we wanna do with the surplus that remains?\n\n2:50:53.580 --> 2:50:55.940\n Maybe I wanna build some fire, build some tools.\n\n2:50:55.940 --> 2:50:57.740\n So put relationships first.\n\n2:50:57.740 --> 2:50:59.300\n I like the worst case analysis\n\n2:50:59.300 --> 2:51:01.220\n from the computer science perspective.\n\n2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:03.420\n Put relationships first.\n\n2:51:03.420 --> 2:51:08.420\n Yeah, because everything else is just assuming average case,\n\n2:51:08.660 --> 2:51:10.740\n assuming things kind of keep going as they were going.\n\n2:51:10.740 --> 2:51:13.420\n And you're neglecting the fundamental human drive.\n\n2:51:13.420 --> 2:51:15.340\n Like we have this, we talked about the boredom instinct.\n\n2:51:15.340 --> 2:51:16.980\n We wanna build things, we wanna have impact,\n\n2:51:16.980 --> 2:51:17.820\n we wanna do productivity.\n\n2:51:17.820 --> 2:51:21.420\n That's not nearly as clear cut of a drive of we need people.\n\n2:51:21.420 --> 2:51:25.620\n But if we look at the real worst case analysis here\n\n2:51:25.620 --> 2:51:28.940\n is one day you're pretty young now,\n\n2:51:28.940 --> 2:51:31.900\n but that's not gonna last very long.\n\n2:51:31.900 --> 2:51:33.100\n You're gonna die one day.\n\n2:51:33.100 --> 2:51:35.260\n Is that something you think about?\n\n2:51:35.260 --> 2:51:36.420\n Little bit.\n\n2:51:36.420 --> 2:51:37.660\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n2:51:37.660 --> 2:51:39.460\n Well, I'm of the mindset of,\n\n2:51:39.460 --> 2:51:41.980\n let's make that a productivity hack.\n\n2:51:41.980 --> 2:51:46.980\n I'm of the mindset of we need to confront that soon.\n\n2:51:47.100 --> 2:51:48.700\n So let's do what we can now\n\n2:51:48.700 --> 2:51:50.660\n so that when we really confront and think about it,\n\n2:51:50.660 --> 2:51:52.780\n we're more likely to feel better about it.\n\n2:51:52.780 --> 2:51:55.860\n So in other words, let's focus now on living\n\n2:51:55.860 --> 2:51:58.660\n and doing things in such a way that we're proud of\n\n2:51:58.660 --> 2:52:00.740\n so that when it really comes time to confront that,\n\n2:52:00.740 --> 2:52:02.780\n we're more likely to say,\n\n2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:05.180\n like, okay, I feel kind of good about the situation.\n\n2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:07.620\n So what, when you're laying on your deathbed,\n\n2:52:07.620 --> 2:52:09.700\n would you, in looking back,\n\n2:52:09.700 --> 2:52:11.060\n what would make you think like,\n\n2:52:11.060 --> 2:52:13.940\n oh, I did okay, I'm proud of that.\n\n2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:15.900\n I optimized the hell out of that.\n\n2:52:15.900 --> 2:52:17.220\n That's a good, I mean, it's a good question\n\n2:52:17.220 --> 2:52:19.940\n to go backwards on.\n\n2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:24.660\n I mean, this is like David Brooks's eulogy virtues\n\n2:52:24.660 --> 2:52:26.860\n versus resume virtues.\n\n2:52:26.860 --> 2:52:28.940\n Right, so his argument is that,\n\n2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:30.740\n and that's another interesting DC area person.\n\n2:52:30.740 --> 2:52:32.980\n I keep thinking of interesting DC area people.\n\n2:52:32.980 --> 2:52:34.540\n All right, David Brooks is here too.\n\n2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:36.220\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:36.220 --> 2:52:38.340\n His argument, he thinks eulogy virtues is,\n\n2:52:38.340 --> 2:52:39.780\n so what we eulogize is different\n\n2:52:39.780 --> 2:52:42.100\n than what we promote on the resume.\n\n2:52:43.020 --> 2:52:44.140\n That's his whole thing now, right?\n\n2:52:44.140 --> 2:52:46.020\n His Suckin Mountain wrote the character.\n\n2:52:46.020 --> 2:52:48.740\n Both these books are, he has this whole premise\n\n2:52:48.740 --> 2:52:50.140\n of there's like this professional phase\n\n2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:53.340\n and there's a phase of giving of yourself\n\n2:52:53.340 --> 2:52:55.740\n and sacrificing on behalf of other people.\n\n2:52:55.740 --> 2:52:57.300\n I don't know, maybe it's all mixed together, right?\n\n2:52:57.300 --> 2:53:00.300\n You wanna, I think living by a code is important, right?\n\n2:53:00.300 --> 2:53:03.180\n I mean, this is something that's not emphasized enough.\n\n2:53:03.180 --> 2:53:05.180\n I always think of advice that my undergrad\n\n2:53:05.180 --> 2:53:06.700\n should be given that they're not given,\n\n2:53:06.700 --> 2:53:07.780\n especially at a place like Georgetown\n\n2:53:07.780 --> 2:53:09.620\n that has this like deep history\n\n2:53:09.620 --> 2:53:11.860\n of trying to promote human flourishing\n\n2:53:11.860 --> 2:53:13.460\n because of the Jesuit connection.\n\n2:53:14.780 --> 2:53:19.340\n There's such resiliency and pride\n\n2:53:19.340 --> 2:53:22.180\n that comes out of living well, even when it's hard,\n\n2:53:22.180 --> 2:53:24.620\n like living according to a code, living accord to,\n\n2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:28.540\n which I think religion used to structure this for people.\n\n2:53:28.540 --> 2:53:30.260\n But in its absence, you need some sort of replacement.\n\n2:53:30.260 --> 2:53:31.860\n But even when things were,\n\n2:53:31.860 --> 2:53:33.540\n soldiers get this a lot, right?\n\n2:53:33.540 --> 2:53:34.380\n They experienced this a lot.\n\n2:53:34.380 --> 2:53:35.220\n Even when things were tough,\n\n2:53:35.220 --> 2:53:36.780\n I was able to persist in living this way\n\n2:53:36.780 --> 2:53:37.620\n that I knew was right,\n\n2:53:37.620 --> 2:53:38.460\n even though it wasn't the easiest thing\n\n2:53:38.460 --> 2:53:39.300\n to do in the moment.\n\n2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:42.100\n Fewer things give humans more resiliency.\n\n2:53:42.100 --> 2:53:43.980\n It's like having done that,\n\n2:53:43.980 --> 2:53:45.700\n your relationships were strong, right?\n\n2:53:45.700 --> 2:53:47.620\n Many people coming to your funeral is a standard.\n\n2:53:47.620 --> 2:53:49.180\n A lot of people are gonna come to your funeral.\n\n2:53:49.180 --> 2:53:51.180\n I mean, you matter to a lot of people.\n\n2:53:51.180 --> 2:53:52.380\n And then maybe having done,\n\n2:53:52.380 --> 2:53:55.660\n to the extent of whatever capabilities\n\n2:53:55.660 --> 2:53:57.900\n you happen to be granted,\n\n2:53:57.900 --> 2:53:59.100\n and they're different for different people,\n\n2:53:59.100 --> 2:54:00.740\n and some people can sprint real fast,\n\n2:54:00.740 --> 2:54:02.860\n and some people can do math problems,\n\n2:54:02.860 --> 2:54:04.820\n try to actually do something of impact.\n\n2:54:06.500 --> 2:54:08.580\n I'll just promise to give gift cards\n\n2:54:08.580 --> 2:54:10.220\n to anybody who shows up to the funeral.\n\n2:54:10.220 --> 2:54:11.060\n You're gonna hack it.\n\n2:54:11.060 --> 2:54:12.900\n I'm gonna hack even the funeral.\n\n2:54:12.900 --> 2:54:14.740\n There's gonna be a lottery wheel you spin\n\n2:54:14.740 --> 2:54:17.940\n when you come in and someone goes away with $10,000.\n\n2:54:17.940 --> 2:54:22.180\n See, the problem is, with all this living by principles,\n\n2:54:22.180 --> 2:54:23.140\n living a principled life,\n\n2:54:23.140 --> 2:54:24.300\n focusing on relationships,\n\n2:54:24.300 --> 2:54:27.780\n and kind of thinking of this life as this perfect thing\n\n2:54:27.780 --> 2:54:30.140\n kind of forgets the notion that none of it\n\n2:54:32.020 --> 2:54:34.220\n makes any sense, right?\n\n2:54:36.220 --> 2:54:40.340\n It kind of implies that this is like a video game\n\n2:54:40.340 --> 2:54:42.420\n and you wanna get a high score,\n\n2:54:42.420 --> 2:54:45.820\n as opposed to none of this even makes sense.\n\n2:54:45.820 --> 2:54:47.980\n Like, why would he, like, what that?\n\n2:54:47.980 --> 2:54:52.660\n Like, what does it even mean to die?\n\n2:54:52.660 --> 2:54:53.700\n It's gonna be over.\n\n2:54:53.700 --> 2:54:57.780\n It's like everything I do, all these productivity hacks,\n\n2:54:57.780 --> 2:55:00.140\n all this life, all these efforts, all this creative efforts,\n\n2:55:00.140 --> 2:55:02.180\n kind of assume it's gonna go on forever.\n\n2:55:02.180 --> 2:55:05.140\n There's a kind of a sense of immortality,\n\n2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:06.660\n and I don't even know how to intellectually\n\n2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:08.380\n make sense that it ends.\n\n2:55:08.380 --> 2:55:10.780\n Of course, gotta ask you in that context,\n\n2:55:10.780 --> 2:55:13.180\n what do you think is the meaning of it all,\n\n2:55:13.180 --> 2:55:14.740\n especially for a computer scientist?\n\n2:55:14.740 --> 2:55:17.380\n I mean, there's gotta be some mathematical.\n\n2:55:17.380 --> 2:55:21.300\n Yeah, 27, or what's the, what's the Douglas Adams?\n\n2:55:21.300 --> 2:55:23.420\n Yeah, or 42, okay.\n\n2:55:23.420 --> 2:55:24.820\n 27 is a better number.\n\n2:55:24.820 --> 2:55:26.940\n I should read more sci fi.\n\n2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:28.860\n Maybe you're onto something with a 27.\n\n2:55:28.860 --> 2:55:31.860\n I don't wanna give away too much, but just trust me, 27.\n\n2:55:31.860 --> 2:55:33.180\n It's visible, yeah.\n\n2:55:34.940 --> 2:55:37.060\n So, I mean, I don't know, obviously, right?\n\n2:55:37.060 --> 2:55:38.060\n I mean, I'm a...\n\n2:55:38.060 --> 2:55:38.900\n I was hoping you would.\n\n2:55:38.900 --> 2:55:41.860\n Yeah, I don't know, but going back to what you were saying\n\n2:55:41.860 --> 2:55:43.460\n about the sort of the existentialist,\n\n2:55:43.460 --> 2:55:47.140\n or sort of the more nihilist style approach,\n\n2:55:47.140 --> 2:55:50.460\n the one thing that there is are intimations, right?\n\n2:55:50.460 --> 2:55:53.700\n So that there's these intimations that human halves\n\n2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:56.540\n of somehow this feels right, and this feels wrong,\n\n2:55:56.540 --> 2:55:59.140\n this feels good, this feels like I'm doing,\n\n2:55:59.140 --> 2:56:01.020\n I'm aligned with something, you know,\n\n2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.140\n when I'm acting with courage to save, whatever, right?\n\n2:56:03.140 --> 2:56:04.900\n It's not, these intimations\n\n2:56:04.900 --> 2:56:07.180\n are a grounding against arbitrariness.\n\n2:56:07.180 --> 2:56:09.780\n Like, one of the ideas I'm really interested in is that\n\n2:56:11.380 --> 2:56:13.500\n when you look at religion, right?\n\n2:56:13.500 --> 2:56:15.780\n So I'm interested in world religions.\n\n2:56:15.780 --> 2:56:18.300\n My grandfather was like a theologian\n\n2:56:18.300 --> 2:56:19.460\n that studied and wrote all these books,\n\n2:56:19.460 --> 2:56:21.380\n and I'm very interested in this type of stuff.\n\n2:56:21.380 --> 2:56:24.540\n And there's this great book that's,\n\n2:56:24.540 --> 2:56:27.500\n it's not specific to a particular religion,\n\n2:56:27.500 --> 2:56:29.220\n but it's Karen Armstrong wrote this great book\n\n2:56:29.220 --> 2:56:30.820\n called The Case for God.\n\n2:56:30.820 --> 2:56:31.660\n She's very interesting.\n\n2:56:31.660 --> 2:56:34.580\n She was a Catholic nun who sort of left that religion,\n\n2:56:34.580 --> 2:56:36.700\n but one of the smartest thinkers\n\n2:56:37.620 --> 2:56:40.220\n in terms of like accessible theological thinking\n\n2:56:40.220 --> 2:56:42.940\n that's not tied to any particular religion.\n\n2:56:42.940 --> 2:56:45.460\n Her whole argument is that the way to understand religion,\n\n2:56:45.460 --> 2:56:47.540\n first of all, you have to go way back pre enlightenment\n\n2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:48.380\n where all this was formed.\n\n2:56:48.380 --> 2:56:50.220\n We got messed up thinking about religion\n\n2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:51.300\n post enlightenment, right?\n\n2:56:51.300 --> 2:56:54.660\n And these were operating systems\n\n2:56:54.660 --> 2:56:56.260\n for making sense of intimations.\n\n2:56:57.620 --> 2:57:00.220\n The one thing we had were these different intimations\n\n2:57:00.220 --> 2:57:03.700\n of this field, like awe and mystical experience.\n\n2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:05.860\n And this feels, there's something you feel\n\n2:57:05.860 --> 2:57:07.140\n when you act in a certain way\n\n2:57:07.140 --> 2:57:08.700\n and don't act in this other way.\n\n2:57:08.700 --> 2:57:11.900\n And it was like the scientists who were trying to study\n\n2:57:11.900 --> 2:57:13.460\n and understand the model of the atom\n\n2:57:13.460 --> 2:57:15.900\n by just looking at experiments and trying to understand\n\n2:57:15.900 --> 2:57:16.740\n what's going on.\n\n2:57:16.740 --> 2:57:18.260\n Like the great religions of the world\n\n2:57:18.260 --> 2:57:19.780\n were basically figuring out\n\n2:57:19.780 --> 2:57:21.300\n how do we make sense of these intimations\n\n2:57:21.300 --> 2:57:22.940\n and live in alignment with them\n\n2:57:22.940 --> 2:57:24.860\n and build a life of meaning around that.\n\n2:57:24.860 --> 2:57:26.180\n What were the tools they were using?\n\n2:57:26.180 --> 2:57:27.140\n They were using ritual.\n\n2:57:27.140 --> 2:57:28.100\n They were using belief.\n\n2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:31.060\n They were using action, but all of it was like an OS.\n\n2:57:31.060 --> 2:57:34.740\n It was like a liturgical model of the atom that did.\n\n2:57:34.740 --> 2:57:35.860\n It's hard coded in.\n\n2:57:35.860 --> 2:57:39.060\n So it did through the evolutionary process.\n\n2:57:39.060 --> 2:57:41.340\n I mean, they wouldn't have called it that back then\n\n2:57:41.340 --> 2:57:45.220\n or yeah, I mean, they didn't have that as pre enlightenment.\n\n2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:46.860\n They just said, this is here.\n\n2:57:46.860 --> 2:57:50.820\n And the directive is to try to live in alignment with that.\n\n2:57:50.820 --> 2:57:53.340\n Well, then I want to ask who wrote the original code.\n\n2:57:53.340 --> 2:57:56.700\n Yeah, so Armstrong lays out this good argument\n\n2:57:56.700 --> 2:57:58.140\n and where it gets really interesting\n\n2:57:58.140 --> 2:58:01.020\n is that she emphasizes that all of this\n\n2:58:01.020 --> 2:58:03.140\n was considered ineffable, right?\n\n2:58:03.140 --> 2:58:05.220\n So the whole notion, and this is like rich\n\n2:58:05.220 --> 2:58:06.420\n in Jewish tradition in particular\n\n2:58:06.420 --> 2:58:08.100\n and also in Islamic tradition,\n\n2:58:08.100 --> 2:58:11.100\n we can't comprehend and understand what's going on here.\n\n2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:11.940\n Right?\n\n2:58:11.940 --> 2:58:13.900\n And so the best we can do to approximate understanding\n\n2:58:13.900 --> 2:58:16.900\n and live in alignment is we act as if this is true,\n\n2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:19.860\n do these rituals, have these actions or whatever.\n\n2:58:19.860 --> 2:58:21.700\n Post enlightenment, a lot of that got,\n\n2:58:22.620 --> 2:58:24.780\n once we learned about enlightenment,\n\n2:58:24.780 --> 2:58:26.620\n we grew these suspicions around religion\n\n2:58:26.620 --> 2:58:28.740\n that are very much of the modern era, right?\n\n2:58:28.740 --> 2:58:30.740\n So like the Karen Armstrong,\n\n2:58:30.740 --> 2:58:33.820\n like Sam Harris's critique of religion makes no sense.\n\n2:58:33.820 --> 2:58:34.660\n Right?\n\n2:58:34.660 --> 2:58:35.980\n The critique's based on, well, this is,\n\n2:58:35.980 --> 2:58:37.580\n you're making the ascent to propositions\n\n2:58:37.580 --> 2:58:39.340\n that you think are true for which you do not have evidence\n\n2:58:39.340 --> 2:58:40.180\n that they are true.\n\n2:58:40.180 --> 2:58:41.580\n That's an enlightenment thing, right?\n\n2:58:41.580 --> 2:58:43.740\n This is not the context and this is not,\n\n2:58:43.740 --> 2:58:46.820\n the religion is the Rutherford model of the atom.\n\n2:58:46.820 --> 2:58:50.380\n Like it's not actually maybe what is underneath happening,\n\n2:58:50.380 --> 2:58:52.740\n but this model explains why your chemical equations work.\n\n2:58:52.740 --> 2:58:55.060\n And so this is like the way religion was.\n\n2:58:55.060 --> 2:58:57.220\n There's a God, we'll call it this, this is how it works,\n\n2:58:57.220 --> 2:58:58.620\n we do this ritual, we act in this way,\n\n2:58:58.620 --> 2:59:00.820\n it aligns with it, just like the model of the atom\n\n2:59:00.820 --> 2:59:03.660\n predicted why NA and CL is gonna become salt,\n\n2:59:03.660 --> 2:59:05.020\n this predicts that you're gonna feel\n\n2:59:05.020 --> 2:59:06.100\n and live in alignment, right?\n\n2:59:06.100 --> 2:59:08.380\n It's like this beautiful sophisticated theory,\n\n2:59:08.380 --> 2:59:11.100\n which actually matches how a lot of great theologians\n\n2:59:11.100 --> 2:59:13.580\n have thought about it.\n\n2:59:13.580 --> 2:59:14.900\n But then when you come forward in time,\n\n2:59:14.900 --> 2:59:15.860\n yeah, maybe it's evolution.\n\n2:59:15.860 --> 2:59:18.420\n I mean, this is like what Peterson hints at, right?\n\n2:59:18.420 --> 2:59:23.420\n Like he's basically, he doesn't like to get super pinned down\n\n2:59:24.260 --> 2:59:27.300\n on this, but it kind of seems where he sees it that way.\n\n2:59:27.300 --> 2:59:29.140\n He's almost like searching for the words.\n\n2:59:29.140 --> 2:59:31.020\n He focuses more on like Jung and other people,\n\n2:59:31.020 --> 2:59:32.900\n but I mean, I know he's very Jungian,\n\n2:59:32.900 --> 2:59:35.820\n but that same type of analysis, I think, roughly speaking,\n\n2:59:35.820 --> 2:59:38.540\n like Armstrong is sort of a, it's kind of like a Peter\n\n2:59:38.540 --> 2:59:41.940\n Sony analysis, but she's looking more at the deep history\n\n2:59:41.940 --> 2:59:45.980\n of religion than, but yeah, he throws in an evolutionary.\n\n2:59:45.980 --> 2:59:48.500\n Yeah, and I wonder what home it finds,\n\n2:59:48.500 --> 2:59:51.860\n I wonder what the new home is if religion dissipates\n\n2:59:51.860 --> 2:59:54.060\n and what the new home for these kinds of\n\n2:59:54.060 --> 2:59:58.180\n natural inclinations are, whether it's technology,\n\n2:59:58.180 --> 2:59:59.020\n whether...\n\n2:59:59.020 --> 3:00:00.900\n And if it's evolution, I mean, this is Francis Collins's\n\n3:00:00.900 --> 3:00:04.420\n book also, he's like, well, that's a religious,\n\n3:00:04.420 --> 3:00:06.500\n that could be a very religious notion.\n\n3:00:06.500 --> 3:00:07.580\n I don't, I think this stuff is interesting.\n\n3:00:07.580 --> 3:00:08.740\n I'm not a very religious person,\n\n3:00:08.740 --> 3:00:11.940\n but I'm thinking it's not a bad idea.\n\n3:00:11.940 --> 3:00:14.540\n Maybe what replaces, honestly, like maybe what replaces\n\n3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:17.260\n religion is a return to religion,\n\n3:00:17.260 --> 3:00:20.060\n but in this sort of more sophisticated...\n\n3:00:20.060 --> 3:00:22.460\n I mean, if you went back, yeah, I mean, it's the issue\n\n3:00:22.460 --> 3:00:24.860\n with like a lot of the recent critiques,\n\n3:00:24.860 --> 3:00:29.660\n I think it's a strong critique in a complicated way, right?\n\n3:00:29.660 --> 3:00:32.380\n Because the whole way these, the way this works,\n\n3:00:32.380 --> 3:00:34.420\n I mean, the theologians, if you're reading Paul Tillich,\n\n3:00:34.420 --> 3:00:36.940\n if you're reading Heschel, if you're reading these people,\n\n3:00:36.940 --> 3:00:39.260\n they're thinking very sophisticatedly about religion\n\n3:00:39.260 --> 3:00:40.780\n in terms of this, it's ineffable,\n\n3:00:40.780 --> 3:00:43.580\n and we're just these things, and it connects us\n\n3:00:43.580 --> 3:00:46.020\n to these things in a way that puts life in alignment.\n\n3:00:46.020 --> 3:00:47.180\n We can't really explain what's going on\n\n3:00:47.180 --> 3:00:50.020\n because our brains can't handle it, right?\n\n3:00:50.020 --> 3:00:53.740\n For the average person though, this notion of live as if\n\n3:00:53.740 --> 3:00:57.620\n is kind of how religions work, is live as if this is true.\n\n3:00:57.620 --> 3:01:00.140\n It's like an OS for getting in alignment with,\n\n3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:02.780\n because through cultural evolution,\n\n3:01:02.780 --> 3:01:04.220\n like you behave in this way, do these words,\n\n3:01:04.220 --> 3:01:07.780\n live as if this is true gives you\n\n3:01:07.780 --> 3:01:10.140\n the goal you're looking for.\n\n3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:12.380\n But that's a complicated thing, live as if this is true,\n\n3:01:12.380 --> 3:01:15.020\n because if you, especially if you're not a theologian,\n\n3:01:15.020 --> 3:01:18.620\n to say, yeah, this is not true in an enlightenment sense,\n\n3:01:18.620 --> 3:01:21.420\n but I'm living as if, it kind of takes the heat out of it,\n\n3:01:21.420 --> 3:01:22.820\n but of course it's what people are doing\n\n3:01:22.820 --> 3:01:25.660\n because highly religious people still do bad things,\n\n3:01:25.660 --> 3:01:28.380\n where if you really were, there's absolutely a hell\n\n3:01:28.380 --> 3:01:30.100\n and I'm definitely gonna go to it if I do this bad thing,\n\n3:01:30.100 --> 3:01:31.980\n you would never have, you know,\n\n3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:33.180\n no one would ever murder anyone\n\n3:01:33.180 --> 3:01:34.800\n if they were an evangelical Christian, right?\n\n3:01:34.800 --> 3:01:37.420\n So it's like what, this is kind of a tangent\n\n3:01:37.420 --> 3:01:39.580\n that I'm on shaky ground here,\n\n3:01:39.580 --> 3:01:43.340\n but it's something I've been interested off and on a lot.\n\n3:01:43.340 --> 3:01:44.500\n Well, it's fascinating, I mean,\n\n3:01:44.500 --> 3:01:46.620\n I think we're in some sense searching for,\n\n3:01:46.620 --> 3:01:48.700\n because it does make for a good operating system,\n\n3:01:48.700 --> 3:01:52.080\n we're searching for a good live as if X is true\n\n3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:54.300\n and we're searching for a new X.\n\n3:01:54.300 --> 3:01:58.820\n And maybe artificial intelligence will be the very,\n\n3:01:58.820 --> 3:02:02.540\n the new gods that we're so desperately looking for.\n\n3:02:02.540 --> 3:02:04.000\n Or it'll just spit out 42.\n\n3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:06.420\n I thought it was 27.\n\n3:02:06.420 --> 3:02:09.820\n Cal, this is, as you know, I've been a huge fan,\n\n3:02:10.780 --> 3:02:14.700\n so are a huge number of people that I've spoken with,\n\n3:02:14.700 --> 3:02:15.980\n so they've been telling me,\n\n3:02:15.980 --> 3:02:18.380\n I absolutely have to talk to you, this is a huge honor,\n\n3:02:18.380 --> 3:02:20.700\n this is really fun, thanks for wasting all this time with me.\n\n3:02:20.700 --> 3:02:22.440\n Yeah, no, likewise, man, I've been a long time fan,\n\n3:02:22.440 --> 3:02:23.520\n so this was a lot of fun.\n\n3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:24.440\n Yeah, thanks, man.\n\n3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:28.140\n
