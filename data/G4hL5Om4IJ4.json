legendary microprocessor architect\n\n00:08.480 --> 00:11.080\n and is widely seen as one of the greatest\n\n00:11.080 --> 00:14.620\n engineering minds of the computing age.\n\n00:14.620 --> 00:18.840\n In a peculiar twist of space time in our simulation,\n\n00:18.840 --> 00:22.200\n Jim is also a brother in law of Jordan Peterson.\n\n00:22.200 --> 00:25.320\n We talk about this and about computing,\n\n00:25.320 --> 00:29.200\n artificial intelligence, consciousness, and life.\n\n00:29.200 --> 00:31.280\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n00:31.280 --> 00:33.780\n Athletic Greens All

level, inspired me to be myself.\n\n00:50.160 --> 00:53.340\n There was something in his words, on and off the mic,\n\n00:53.340 --> 00:56.200\n or perhaps that he even paid attention to me at all,\n\n00:56.200 --> 00:59.160\n that almost told me, you're all right, kid.\n\n00:59.160 --> 01:01.820\n A kind of pat on the back that can make the difference\n\n01:01.820 --> 01:03.640\n between a mind that flourishes\n\n01:03.640 --> 01:05.760\n and a mind that is broken down\n\n01:05.760 --> 01:08.160\n by the cynicism of the world.\n\n01:08.160 --> 01:10.440\n So I guess that's just my brief few words\n\n01:10.440 --> 01:12.800\n of thank you to Jim, and in general,\n\n01:12.800 --> 01:15.440\n gratitude for the people who have given me a chance\n\n01:15.440 --> 01:19.000\n on this podcast, in my work, and in life.\n\n01:19.000 --> 01:21.200\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:21.200 --> 01:24.240\n review on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify,\n\n01:24.240 -->

--> 01:35.340\n What's the value and effectiveness\n\n01:35.340 --> 01:38.080\n of theory versus engineering, this dichotomy,\n\n01:38.080 --> 01:43.080\n in building good software or hardware systems?\n\n01:43.400 --> 01:45.520\n Well, good design is both.\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:48.680\n I guess that's pretty obvious.\n\n01:48.680 --> 01:51.840\n By engineering, do you mean reduction of practice\n\n01:51.840 --> 01:53.260\n of known methods?\n\n01:53.260 --> 01:55.960\n And then science is the pursuit of discovering things\n\n01:55.960 --> 01:57.780\n that people don't understand.\n\n01:57.780 --> 02:00.340\n Or solving unknown problems.\n\n02:00.340 --> 02:01.960\n Definitions are interesting here,\n\n02:01.960 --> 02:04.120\n but I was thinking more in theory,\n\n02:04.120 --> 02:06.740\n constructing models that kind of generalize\n\n02:06.740 --> 02:08.540\n about how things work.\n\n02:08.540 --> 02:12.760\n And engineering is actually building stuff.\n\n02:12.760 --> 02:16.180\n The pragmatic, like, okay, we have these nice models,\n\n02:16.180 --> 02:17.920\n but how do we actually get things to work?\n\n02:17.920 --> 02:20.740\n Maybe economics is a nice example.\n\n02:20.740 --> 02:22.440\n Like, economists have all these models\n\n02:22.440 --> 02:23.640\n of how the economy works,\n\n02:23.640 --> 02:26.680\n and how different policies will have an effect,\n\n02:26.680 --> 02:29.240\n but then there's the actual, okay,\n\n02:29.240 --> 02:30.480\n let's call it engineering,\n\n02:30.480 --> 02:33.240\n of like, actually deploying the policies.\n\n02:33.240 --> 02:36.380\n So computer design is almost all engineering.\n\n02:36.380 --> 02:38.200\n And reduction of practice of known methods.\n\n02:38.200 --> 02:43.200\n Now, because of the complexity of the computers we built,\n\n02:43.560 --> 02:44.960\n you know, you could think you're,\n\n02:44.960 --> 02:46.600\n well, we'll just go write some code,\n\n02:46.600 --> 02:49.160\n and then we'll verify it, and then we'll put it together,\n\n02:49.160 --> 02:50.920\n and then you find out that the combination\n\n02:50.920 --> 02:53.200\n of all that stuff is complicated.\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:54.700\n And then you have to be inventive\n\n02:54.700 --> 02:56.920\n to figure out how to do it, right?\n\n02:56.920 --> 02:59.760\n So that definitely happens a lot.\n\n02:59.760 --> 03:04.440\n And then, every so often, some big idea happens.\n\n03:04.440 --> 03:06.360\n But it might be one person.\n\n03:06.360 --> 03:08.840\n And that idea is in the space of engineering,\n\n03:08.840 --> 03:10.440\n or is it in the space of...\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:11.380\n Well, I'll give you an example.\n\n03:11.380 --> 03:13.140\n So one of the limits of computer performance\n\n03:13.140 --> 03:14.880\n is branch prediction.\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:17.500\n So, and there's a whole bunch of ideas\n\n03:17.500 --> 03:19.440\n about how good you could predict a branch.\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:21.640\n And people said, there's a limit to it,\n\n03:21.640 --> 03:23.480\n it's an asymptotic curve.\n\n03:23.480 --> 03:24.920\n And somebody came up with a better way\n\n03:24.920 --> 03:27.400\n to do branch prediction, it was a lot better.\n\n03:28.280 --> 03:29.720\n And he published a paper on it,\n\n03:29.720 --> 03:32.760\n and every computer in the world now uses it.\n\n03:32.760 --> 03:34.600\n And it was one idea.\n\n03:34.600 --> 03:37.960\n So the engineers who build branch prediction hardware\n\n03:37.960 --> 03:40.520\n were happy to drop the one kind of training array\n\n03:40.520 --> 03:42.380\n and put it in another one.\n\n03:42.380 --> 03:44.840\n So it was a real idea.\n\n03:44.840 --> 03:48.520\n And branch prediction is one of the key problems\n\n03:48.520 --> 03:51.960\n underlying all of sort of the lowest level of software.\n\n03:51.960 --> 03:53.800\n It boils down to branch prediction.\n\n03:53.800 --> 03:54.860\n Boils down to uncertainty.\n\n03:54.860 --> 03:56.280\n Computers are limited by...\n\n03:56.280 --> 03:58.640\n Single thread computer is limited by two things.\n\n03:58.640 --> 04:01.400\n The predictability of the path of the branches\n\n04:01.400 --> 04:04.140\n and the predictability of the locality of data.\n\n04:05.320 --> 04:07.080\n So we have predictors that now predict\n\n04:07.080 --> 04:09.160\n both of those pretty well.\n\n04:09.160 --> 04:11.880\n So memory is a couple hundred cycles away,\n\n04:11.880 --> 04:14.540\n local cache is a couple cycles away.\n\n04:14.540 --> 04:15.720\n When you're executing fast,\n\n04:15.720 --> 04:19.020\n virtually all the data has to be in the local cache.\n\n04:19.020 --> 04:21.320\n So a simple program says,\n\n04:21.320 --> 04:23.280\n add one to every element in an array,\n\n04:23.280 --> 04:26.680\n it's really easy to see what the stream of data will be.\n\n04:26.680 --> 04:28.520\n But you might have a more complicated program\n\n04:28.520 --> 04:31.080\n that says, get an element of this array,\n\n04:31.080 --> 04:32.800\n look at something, make a decision,\n\n04:32.800 --> 04:35.200\n go get another element, it's kind of random.\n\n04:35.200 --> 04:37.760\n And you can think, that's really unpredictable.\n\n04:37.760 --> 04:39.200\n And then you make this big predictor\n\n04:39.200 --> 04:41.400\n that looks at this kind of pattern and you realize,\n\n04:41.400 --> 04:43.000\n well, if you get this data and this data,\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:44.560\n then you probably want that one.\n\n04:44.560 --> 04:46.440\n And if you get this one and this one and this one,\n\n04:46.440 --> 04:47.960\n you probably want that one.\n\n04:47.960 --> 04:49.920\n And is that theory or is that engineering?\n\n04:49.920 --> 04:51.320\n Like the paper that was written,\n\n04:51.320 --> 04:54.640\n was it asymptotic kind of discussion\n\n04:54.640 --> 04:57.920\n or is it more like, here's a hack that works well?\n\n04:57.920 --> 04:59.100\n It's a little bit of both.\n\n04:59.100 --> 05:01.280\n Like there's information theory in it, I think somewhere.\n\n05:01.280 --> 05:04.320\n Okay, so it's actually trying to prove some kind of stuff.\n\n05:04.320 --> 05:06.360\n But once you know the method,\n\n05:06.360 --> 05:08.660\n implementing it is an engineering problem.\n\n05:09.560 --> 05:10.800\n Now there's a flip side of this,\n\n05:10.800 --> 05:13.400\n which is in a big design team,\n\n05:13.400 --> 05:14.960\n what percentage of people think\n\n05:14.960 --> 05:19.960\n their plan or their life's work is engineering\n\n05:20.800 --> 05:23.480\n versus inventing things?\n\n05:23.480 --> 05:27.520\n So lots of companies will reward you for filing patents.\n\n05:27.520 --> 05:29.280\n Some, many big companies get stuck\n\n05:29.280 --> 05:30.420\n because to get promoted,\n\n05:30.420 --> 05:32.940\n you have to come up with something new.\n\n05:32.940 --> 05:34.740\n And then what happens is everybody's trying\n\n05:34.740 --> 05:36.480\n to do some random new thing,\n\n05:36.480 --> 05:39.120\n 99% of which doesn't matter.\n\n05:39.120 --> 05:41.140\n And the basics get neglected.\n\n05:41.140 --> 05:46.140\n Or there's a dichotomy, they think like the cell library\n\n05:47.700 --> 05:52.700\n and the basic CAD tools or basic software validation methods,\n\n05:53.260 --> 05:54.740\n that's simple stuff.\n\n05:54.740 --> 05:56.900\n They wanna work on the exciting stuff.\n\n05:56.900 --> 05:58.460\n And then they spend lots of time\n\n05:58.460 --> 06:00.740\n trying to figure out how to patent something.\n\n06:00.740 --> 06:02.240\n And that's mostly useless.\n\n06:02.240 --> 06:04.580\n But the breakthrough is on simple stuff.\n\n06:04.580 --> 06:08.940\n No, no, you have to do the simple stuff really well.\n\n06:08.940 --> 06:11.460\n If you're building a building out of bricks,\n\n06:11.460 --> 06:13.240\n you want great bricks.\n\n06:13.240 --> 06:14.900\n So you go to two places that sell bricks.\n\n06:14.900 --> 06:17.980\n So one guy says, yeah, they're over there in a ugly pile.\n\n06:17.980 --> 06:19.860\n And the other guy is like lovingly tells you\n\n06:19.860 --> 06:22.300\n about the 50 kinds of bricks and how hard they are\n\n06:22.300 --> 06:26.100\n and how beautiful they are and how square they are.\n\n06:26.100 --> 06:28.220\n Which one are you gonna buy bricks from?\n\n06:28.220 --> 06:30.420\n Which is gonna make a better house?\n\n06:30.420 --> 06:32.020\n So you're talking about the craftsman,\n\n06:32.020 --> 06:33.500\n the person who understands bricks,\n\n06:33.500 --> 06:35.140\n who loves bricks, who loves the varieties.\n\n06:35.140 --> 06:36.540\n That's a good word.\n\n06:36.540 --> 06:39.460\n Good engineering is great craftsmanship.\n\n06:39.460 --> 06:44.460\n And when you start thinking engineering is about invention\n\n06:44.880 --> 06:47.940\n and you set up a system that rewards invention,\n\n06:47.940 --> 06:50.660\n the craftsmanship gets neglected.\n\n06:50.660 --> 06:53.500\n Okay, so maybe one perspective is the theory,\n\n06:53.500 --> 06:57.660\n the science overemphasizes invention\n\n06:57.660 --> 07:00.420\n and engineering emphasizes craftsmanship.\n\n07:00.420 --> 07:03.940\n And therefore, so it doesn't matter what you do,\n\n07:03.940 --> 07:05.060\n theory, engineering. Well, everybody does.\n\n07:05.060 --> 07:06.740\n Like read the tech ranks are always talking\n\n07:06.740 --> 07:09.540\n about some breakthrough or innovation\n\n07:09.540 --> 07:12.460\n and everybody thinks that's the most important thing.\n\n07:12.460 --> 07:13.900\n But the number of innovative ideas\n\n07:13.900 --> 07:15.980\n is actually relatively low.\n\n07:15.980 --> 07:17.260\n We need them, right?\n\n07:17.260 --> 07:19.820\n And innovation creates a whole new opportunity.\n\n07:19.820 --> 07:24.020\n Like when some guy invented the internet, right?\n\n07:24.020 --> 07:25.940\n Like that was a big thing.\n\n07:25.940 --> 07:28.240\n The million people that wrote software against that\n\n07:28.240 --> 07:31.180\n were mostly doing engineering software writing.\n\n07:31.180 --> 07:34.300\n So the elaboration of that idea was huge.\n\n07:34.300 --> 07:35.580\n I don't know if you know Brendan Eich,\n\n07:35.580 --> 07:38.180\n he wrote JavaScript in 10 days.\n\n07:38.180 --> 07:39.540\n That's an interesting story.\n\n07:39.540 --> 07:43.740\n It makes me wonder, and it was famously for many years\n\n07:43.740 --> 07:47.660\n considered to be a pretty crappy programming language.\n\n07:47.660 --> 07:48.780\n Still is perhaps.\n\n07:48.780 --> 07:51.140\n It's been improving sort of consistently.\n\n07:51.140 --> 07:55.580\n But the interesting thing about that guy is,\n\n07:55.580 --> 07:57.380\n you know, he doesn't get any awards.\n\n07:58.540 --> 08:01.140\n You don't get a Nobel Prize or a Fields Medal or.\n\n08:01.140 --> 08:06.140\n For inventing a crappy piece of, you know, software code.\n\n08:06.820 --> 08:08.700\n That is currently the number one programming language\n\n08:08.700 --> 08:10.100\n in the world and runs,\n\n08:10.100 --> 08:13.740\n now is increasingly running the backend of the internet.\n\n08:13.740 --> 08:17.640\n Well, does he know why everybody uses it?\n\n08:17.640 --> 08:19.300\n Like that would be an interesting thing.\n\n08:19.300 --> 08:22.340\n Was it the right thing at the right time?\n\n08:22.340 --> 08:24.900\n Cause like when stuff like JavaScript came out,\n\n08:24.900 --> 08:26.260\n like there was a move from, you know,\n\n08:26.260 --> 08:30.620\n writing C programs and C++ to what they call\n\n08:30.620 --> 08:32.340\n managed code frameworks,\n\n08:32.340 --> 08:35.220\n where you write simple code, it might be interpreted,\n\n08:35.220 --> 08:37.780\n it has lots of libraries, productivity is high,\n\n08:37.780 --> 08:39.520\n and you don't have to be an expert.\n\n08:39.520 --> 08:41.340\n So, you know, Java was supposed to solve\n\n08:41.340 --> 08:42.180\n all the world's problems.\n\n08:42.180 --> 08:43.780\n It was complicated.\n\n08:43.780 --> 08:45.220\n JavaScript came out, you know,\n\n08:45.220 --> 08:47.660\n after a bunch of other scripting languages.\n\n08:47.660 --> 08:49.220\n I'm not an expert on it.\n\n08:49.220 --> 08:51.420\n But was it the right thing at the right time?\n\n08:51.420 --> 08:54.260\n Or was there something, you know, clever?\n\n08:54.260 --> 08:56.300\n Cause he wasn't the only one.\n\n08:56.300 --> 08:57.420\n There's a few elements.\n\n08:57.420 --> 08:59.500\n And maybe if he figured out what it was,\n\n08:59.500 --> 09:00.880\n then he'd get a prize.\n\n09:02.020 --> 09:02.860\n Like that.\n\n09:02.860 --> 09:06.860\n Yeah, you know, maybe his problem is he hasn't defined this.\n\n09:06.860 --> 09:08.500\n Or he just needs a good promoter.\n\n09:09.500 --> 09:11.900\n Well, I think there was a bunch of blog posts\n\n09:11.900 --> 09:13.620\n written about it, which is like,\n\n09:13.620 --> 09:18.620\n wrong is right, which is like doing the crappy thing fast.\n\n09:19.340 --> 09:21.340\n Just like hacking together the thing\n\n09:21.340 --> 09:23.260\n that answers some of the needs.\n\n09:23.260 --> 09:26.100\n And then iterating over time, listening to developers.\n\n09:26.100 --> 09:28.220\n Like listening to people who actually use the thing.\n\n09:28.220 --> 09:30.500\n This is something you can do more in software.\n\n09:31.540 --> 09:33.760\n But the right time, like you have to sense,\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:35.140\n you have to have a good instinct\n\n09:35.140 --> 09:37.580\n of when is the right time for the right tool.\n\n09:37.580 --> 09:39.400\n And make it super simple.\n\n09:40.260 --> 09:42.720\n And just get it out there.\n\n09:42.720 --> 09:45.200\n The problem is, this is true with hardware.\n\n09:45.200 --> 09:46.420\n This is less true with software.\n\n09:46.420 --> 09:48.420\n Is there's backward compatibility\n\n09:48.420 --> 09:51.740\n that just drags behind you as, you know,\n\n09:51.740 --> 09:53.820\n as you try to fix all the mistakes of the past.\n\n09:53.820 --> 09:55.820\n But the timing.\n\n09:55.820 --> 09:56.640\n It was good.\n\n09:56.640 --> 09:57.480\n There's something about that.\n\n09:57.480 --> 09:58.820\n And it wasn't accidental.\n\n09:58.820 --> 10:02.580\n You have to like give yourself over to the,\n\n10:02.580 --> 10:05.380\n you have to have this like broad sense\n\n10:05.380 --> 10:06.900\n of what's needed now.\n\n10:07.740 --> 10:10.860\n Both scientifically and like the community.\n\n10:10.860 --> 10:15.500\n And just like this, it was obvious that there was no,\n\n10:15.500 --> 10:17.980\n the interesting thing about JavaScript\n\n10:17.980 --> 10:20.900\n is everything that ran in the browser at the time,\n\n10:20.900 --> 10:24.460\n like Java and I think other like Scheme,\n\n10:24.460 --> 10:25.940\n other programming languages,\n\n10:25.940 --> 10:30.500\n they were all in a separate external container.\n\n10:30.500 --> 10:32.500\n And then JavaScript was literally\n\n10:32.500 --> 10:34.620\n just injected into the webpage.\n\n10:34.620 --> 10:36.380\n It was the dumbest possible thing\n\n10:36.380 --> 10:39.340\n running in the same thread as everything else.\n\n10:39.340 --> 10:43.100\n And like it was inserted as a comment.\n\n10:43.100 --> 10:47.420\n So JavaScript code is inserted as a comment in the HTML code.\n\n10:47.420 --> 10:50.260\n And it was, I mean, there's,\n\n10:50.260 --> 10:53.100\n it's either genius or super dumb, but it's like.\n\n10:53.100 --> 10:55.980\n Right, so it had no apparatus for like a virtual machine\n\n10:55.980 --> 10:58.460\n and container, it just executed in the framework\n\n10:58.460 --> 10:59.780\n of the program that's already running.\n\n10:59.780 --> 11:00.940\n Yeah, that's cool.\n\n11:00.940 --> 11:04.140\n And then because something about that accessibility,\n\n11:04.140 --> 11:09.140\n the ease of its use resulted in then developers innovating\n\n11:10.060 --> 11:11.420\n of how to actually use it.\n\n11:11.420 --> 11:13.660\n I mean, I don't even know what to make of that,\n\n11:13.660 --> 11:18.340\n but it does seem to echo across different software,\n\n11:18.340 --> 11:19.740\n like stories of different software.\n\n11:19.740 --> 11:22.900\n PHP has the same story, really crappy language.\n\n11:22.900 --> 11:24.420\n They just took over the world.\n\n11:25.380 --> 11:28.340\n I always have a joke that the random length instructions,\n\n11:28.340 --> 11:30.660\n variable length instructions, that's always one,\n\n11:30.660 --> 11:33.060\n even though they're obviously worse.\n\n11:33.060 --> 11:34.460\n Like nobody knows why.\n\n11:34.460 --> 11:38.660\n X86 is arguably the worst architecture on the planet.\n\n11:38.660 --> 11:40.500\n It's one of the most popular ones.\n\n11:40.500 --> 11:43.700\n Well, I mean, isn't that also the story of risk versus,\n\n11:43.700 --> 11:46.220\n I mean, is that simplicity?\n\n11:46.220 --> 11:49.420\n There's something about simplicity that us\n\n11:49.420 --> 11:53.500\n in this evolutionary process is valued.\n\n11:53.500 --> 11:58.500\n If it's simple, it spreads faster, it seems like.\n\n11:58.820 --> 11:59.980\n Or is that not always true?\n\n11:59.980 --> 12:01.140\n Not always true.\n\n12:01.140 --> 12:04.260\n Yeah, it could be simple is good, but too simple is bad.\n\n12:04.260 --> 12:06.460\n So why did risk win, you think, so far?\n\n12:06.460 --> 12:07.300\n Did risk win?\n\n12:08.700 --> 12:10.580\n In the long archivist tree.\n\n12:10.580 --> 12:11.420\n We don't know.\n\n12:11.420 --> 12:12.700\n So who's gonna win?\n\n12:12.700 --> 12:15.900\n What's risk, what's CISC, and who's gonna win in that space\n\n12:15.900 --> 12:17.580\n in these instruction sets?\n\n12:17.580 --> 12:21.140\n AI software's gonna win, but there'll be little computers\n\n12:21.140 --> 12:23.940\n that run little programs like normal all over the place.\n\n12:24.980 --> 12:28.580\n But we're going through another transformation, so.\n\n12:28.580 --> 12:32.420\n But you think instruction sets underneath it all will change?\n\n12:32.420 --> 12:33.700\n Yeah, they evolve slowly.\n\n12:33.700 --> 12:35.500\n They don't matter very much.\n\n12:35.500 --> 12:36.820\n They don't matter very much, okay.\n\n12:36.820 --> 12:40.420\n I mean, the limits of performance are predictability\n\n12:40.420 --> 12:41.700\n of instructions and data.\n\n12:41.700 --> 12:43.420\n I mean, that's the big thing.\n\n12:43.420 --> 12:48.420\n And then the usability of it is some quality of design,\n\n12:49.180 --> 12:52.180\n quality of tools, availability.\n\n12:52.180 --> 12:56.460\n Like right now, x86 is proprietary with Intel and AMD,\n\n12:56.460 --> 12:59.740\n but they can change it any way they want independently.\n\n12:59.740 --> 13:01.660\n ARM is proprietary to ARM,\n\n13:01.660 --> 13:03.700\n and they won't let anybody else change it.\n\n13:03.700 --> 13:05.740\n So it's like a sole point.\n\n13:05.740 --> 13:09.140\n And RISC 5 is open source, so anybody can change it,\n\n13:09.140 --> 13:10.660\n which is super cool.\n\n13:10.660 --> 13:12.500\n But that also might mean it gets changed\n\n13:12.500 --> 13:16.340\n too many random ways that there's no common subset of it\n\n13:16.340 --> 13:17.700\n that people can use.\n\n13:17.700 --> 13:19.940\n Do you like open or do you like closed?\n\n13:19.940 --> 13:21.780\n Like if you were to bet all your money on one\n\n13:21.780 --> 13:23.300\n or the other, RISC 5 versus it?\n\n13:23.300 --> 13:24.180\n No idea.\n\n13:24.180 --> 13:25.020\n It's case dependent?\n\n13:25.020 --> 13:27.660\n Well, x86, oddly enough, when Intel first started\n\n13:27.660 --> 13:30.220\n developing it, they licensed like seven people.\n\n13:30.220 --> 13:33.060\n So it was the open architecture.\n\n13:33.060 --> 13:35.340\n And then they moved faster than others\n\n13:35.340 --> 13:37.460\n and also bought one or two of them.\n\n13:37.460 --> 13:40.260\n But there was seven different people making x86\n\n13:40.260 --> 13:45.260\n because at the time there was 6502 and Z80s and 8086.\n\n13:46.940 --> 13:49.060\n And you could argue everybody thought Z80\n\n13:49.060 --> 13:50.940\n was the better instruction set,\n\n13:50.940 --> 13:54.460\n but that was proprietary to one place.\n\n13:54.460 --> 13:56.100\n Oh, and the 6800.\n\n13:56.100 --> 13:59.420\n So there's like four or five different microprocessors.\n\n13:59.420 --> 14:02.380\n Intel went open, got the market share\n\n14:02.380 --> 14:04.700\n because people felt like they had multiple sources from it,\n\n14:04.700 --> 14:07.620\n and then over time it narrowed down to two players.\n\n14:07.620 --> 14:12.620\n So why, you as a historian, why did Intel win for so long\n\n14:14.420 --> 14:17.260\n with their processors?\n\n14:17.260 --> 14:18.100\n I mean, I mean.\n\n14:18.100 --> 14:18.940\n They were great.\n\n14:18.940 --> 14:21.020\n Their process development was great.\n\n14:21.020 --> 14:23.700\n Oh, so it's just looking back to JavaScript\n\n14:23.700 --> 14:26.540\n and what I like is Microsoft and Netscape\n\n14:26.540 --> 14:28.940\n and all these internet browsers.\n\n14:28.940 --> 14:31.740\n Microsoft won the browser game\n\n14:31.740 --> 14:35.940\n because they aggressively stole other people's ideas\n\n14:35.940 --> 14:37.820\n like right after they did it.\n\n14:37.820 --> 14:39.100\n You know, I don't know\n\n14:39.100 --> 14:41.180\n if Intel was stealing other people's ideas.\n\n14:41.180 --> 14:42.020\n They started making.\n\n14:42.020 --> 14:43.780\n In a good way, stealing in a good way just to clarify.\n\n14:43.780 --> 14:48.260\n They started making RAMs, random access memories.\n\n14:48.260 --> 14:50.300\n And then at the time\n\n14:50.300 --> 14:52.940\n when the Japanese manufacturers came up,\n\n14:52.940 --> 14:54.860\n you know, they were getting out competed on that\n\n14:54.860 --> 14:56.580\n and they pivoted the microprocessors\n\n14:56.580 --> 14:57.700\n and they made the first, you know,\n\n14:57.700 --> 14:59.860\n integrated microprocessor grant programs.\n\n14:59.860 --> 15:03.820\n It was the 4D04 or something.\n\n15:03.820 --> 15:04.820\n Who was behind that pivot?\n\n15:04.820 --> 15:05.860\n That's a hell of a pivot.\n\n15:05.860 --> 15:07.740\n Andy Grove and he was great.\n\n15:08.780 --> 15:10.140\n That's a hell of a pivot.\n\n15:10.140 --> 15:13.860\n And then they led semiconductor industry.\n\n15:13.860 --> 15:15.980\n Like they were just a little company, IBM,\n\n15:15.980 --> 15:18.980\n all kinds of big companies had boatloads of money\n\n15:18.980 --> 15:21.180\n and they out innovated everybody.\n\n15:21.180 --> 15:22.420\n Out innovated, okay.\n\n15:22.420 --> 15:23.260\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n15:23.260 --> 15:26.260\n So it's not like marketing, it's not any of that stuff.\n\n15:26.260 --> 15:28.420\n Their processor designs were pretty good.\n\n15:29.340 --> 15:34.340\n I think the, you know, Core 2 was probably the first one\n\n15:34.340 --> 15:36.180\n I thought was great.\n\n15:36.180 --> 15:38.980\n It was a really fast processor and then Haswell was great.\n\n15:40.180 --> 15:42.220\n What makes a great processor in that?\n\n15:42.220 --> 15:43.300\n Oh, if you just look at it,\n\n15:43.300 --> 15:45.580\n it's performance versus everybody else.\n\n15:45.580 --> 15:49.860\n It's, you know, the size of it, the usability of it.\n\n15:49.860 --> 15:50.940\n So it's not specific,\n\n15:50.940 --> 15:52.620\n some kind of element that makes you beautiful.\n\n15:52.620 --> 15:55.100\n It's just like literally just raw performance.\n\n15:55.100 --> 15:57.140\n Is that how you think about processors?\n\n15:57.140 --> 15:59.740\n It's just like raw performance?\n\n15:59.740 --> 16:01.300\n Of course.\n\n16:01.300 --> 16:02.300\n It's like a horse race.\n\n16:02.300 --> 16:04.260\n The fastest one wins.\n\n16:04.260 --> 16:05.100\n Now.\n\n16:05.100 --> 16:05.940\n You don't care how.\n\n16:05.940 --> 16:08.460\n Just as long as it wins.\n\n16:08.460 --> 16:10.620\n Well, there's the fastest in the environment.\n\n16:10.620 --> 16:13.060\n Like, you know, for years you made the fastest one you could\n\n16:13.060 --> 16:14.940\n and then people started to have power limits.\n\n16:14.940 --> 16:17.660\n So then you made the fastest at the right PowerPoint.\n\n16:17.660 --> 16:20.460\n And then when we started doing multi processors,\n\n16:20.460 --> 16:23.580\n like if you could scale your processors\n\n16:23.580 --> 16:24.420\n more than the other guy,\n\n16:24.420 --> 16:26.980\n you could be 10% faster on like a single thread,\n\n16:26.980 --> 16:28.420\n but you have more threads.\n\n16:28.420 --> 16:30.020\n So there's lots of variability.\n\n16:30.020 --> 16:34.460\n And then ARM really explored,\n\n16:34.460 --> 16:36.580\n like, you know, they have the A series\n\n16:36.580 --> 16:38.900\n and the R series and the M series,\n\n16:38.900 --> 16:40.340\n like a family of processors\n\n16:40.340 --> 16:41.980\n for all these different design points\n\n16:41.980 --> 16:44.580\n from like unbelievably small and simple.\n\n16:44.580 --> 16:46.540\n And so then when you're doing the design,\n\n16:46.540 --> 16:49.380\n it's sort of like this big pallet of CPUs.\n\n16:49.380 --> 16:51.500\n Like they're the only ones with a credible,\n\n16:51.500 --> 16:53.020\n you know, top to bottom pallet.\n\n16:54.700 --> 16:56.900\n What do you mean a credible top to bottom?\n\n16:56.900 --> 16:58.620\n Well, there's people who make microcontrollers\n\n16:58.620 --> 17:00.500\n that are small, but they don't have a fast one.\n\n17:00.500 --> 17:02.080\n There's people who make fast processors,\n\n17:02.080 --> 17:04.900\n but don't have a medium one or a small one.\n\n17:04.900 --> 17:07.420\n Is that hard to do that full pallet?\n\n17:07.420 --> 17:08.260\n That seems like a...\n\n17:08.260 --> 17:09.380\n Yeah, it's a lot of different.\n\n17:09.380 --> 17:13.340\n So what's the difference in the ARM folks and Intel\n\n17:13.340 --> 17:15.620\n in terms of the way they're approaching this problem?\n\n17:15.620 --> 17:19.200\n Well, Intel, almost all their processor designs\n\n17:19.200 --> 17:21.740\n were, you know, very custom high end,\n\n17:21.740 --> 17:23.460\n you know, for the last 15, 20 years.\n\n17:23.460 --> 17:24.900\n So the fastest horse possible.\n\n17:24.900 --> 17:25.860\n Yeah.\n\n17:25.860 --> 17:27.540\n In one horse race.\n\n17:27.540 --> 17:30.420\n Yeah, and then architecturally they're really good,\n\n17:30.420 --> 17:33.380\n but the company itself was fairly insular\n\n17:33.380 --> 17:36.300\n to what's going on in the industry with CAD tools and stuff.\n\n17:36.300 --> 17:38.200\n And there's this debate about custom design\n\n17:38.200 --> 17:41.340\n versus synthesis and how do you approach that?\n\n17:41.340 --> 17:45.700\n I'd say Intel was slow on getting to synthesize processors.\n\n17:45.700 --> 17:49.100\n ARM came in from the bottom and they generated IP,\n\n17:49.100 --> 17:50.860\n which went to all kinds of customers.\n\n17:50.860 --> 17:52.020\n So they had very little say\n\n17:52.020 --> 17:54.980\n on how the customer implemented their IP.\n\n17:54.980 --> 17:59.420\n So ARM is super friendly to the synthesis IP environment.\n\n17:59.420 --> 18:00.260\n Whereas Intel said,\n\n18:00.260 --> 18:03.200\n we're gonna make this great client chip or server chip\n\n18:03.200 --> 18:05.460\n with our own CAD tools, with our own process,\n\n18:05.460 --> 18:08.140\n with our own, you know, other supporting IP\n\n18:08.140 --> 18:10.140\n and everything only works with our stuff.\n\n18:11.340 --> 18:16.340\n So is that, is ARM winning the mobile platform space\n\n18:16.440 --> 18:17.280\n in terms of process?\n\n18:17.280 --> 18:18.120\n Yeah.\n\n18:18.120 --> 18:21.780\n And so in that, what you're describing\n\n18:21.780 --> 18:22.860\n is why they're winning.\n\n18:22.860 --> 18:24.940\n Well, they had lots of people doing lots\n\n18:24.940 --> 18:26.420\n of different experiments.\n\n18:26.420 --> 18:29.420\n So they controlled the processor architecture and IP,\n\n18:29.420 --> 18:32.060\n but they let people put in lots of different chips.\n\n18:32.060 --> 18:35.260\n And there was a lot of variability in what happened there.\n\n18:35.260 --> 18:37.140\n Whereas Intel, when they made their mobile,\n\n18:37.140 --> 18:38.460\n their foray into mobile,\n\n18:38.460 --> 18:41.700\n they had one team doing one part, right?\n\n18:41.700 --> 18:43.180\n So it wasn't 10 experiments.\n\n18:43.180 --> 18:45.980\n And then their mindset was PC mindset,\n\n18:45.980 --> 18:48.060\n Microsoft software mindset.\n\n18:48.060 --> 18:49.940\n And that brought a whole bunch of things along\n\n18:49.940 --> 18:52.580\n that the mobile world and the embedded world don't do.\n\n18:52.580 --> 18:55.460\n Do you think it was possible for Intel to pivot hard\n\n18:55.460 --> 18:58.260\n and win the mobile market?\n\n18:58.260 --> 19:00.060\n That's a hell of a difficult thing to do, right?\n\n19:00.060 --> 19:02.040\n For a huge company to just pivot.\n\n19:03.420 --> 19:05.540\n I mean, it's so interesting to,\n\n19:05.540 --> 19:07.420\n because we'll talk about your current work.\n\n19:07.420 --> 19:11.100\n It's like, it's clear that PCs were dominating\n\n19:11.100 --> 19:14.180\n for several decades, like desktop computers.\n\n19:14.180 --> 19:17.940\n And then mobile, it's unclear.\n\n19:17.940 --> 19:19.380\n It's a leadership question.\n\n19:19.380 --> 19:23.060\n Like Apple under Steve Jobs, when he came back,\n\n19:23.060 --> 19:24.760\n they pivoted multiple times.\n\n19:25.660 --> 19:28.260\n You know, they built iPads and iTunes and phones\n\n19:28.260 --> 19:30.060\n and tablets and great Macs.\n\n19:30.060 --> 19:33.380\n Like who knew computers should be made out of aluminum?\n\n19:33.380 --> 19:34.260\n Nobody knew that.\n\n19:35.300 --> 19:36.140\n But they're great.\n\n19:36.140 --> 19:37.160\n It's super fun.\n\n19:37.160 --> 19:38.000\n That was Steve?\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:38.820\n Yeah, Steve Jobs.\n\n19:38.820 --> 19:40.540\n Like they pivoted multiple times.\n\n19:41.400 --> 19:45.860\n And you know, the old Intel, they did that multiple times.\n\n19:45.860 --> 19:48.420\n They made DRAMs and processors and processes\n\n19:48.420 --> 19:50.900\n and I gotta ask this,\n\n19:50.900 --> 19:53.060\n what was it like working with Steve Jobs?\n\n19:53.060 --> 19:54.420\n I didn't work with him.\n\n19:54.420 --> 19:55.700\n Did you interact with him?\n\n19:55.700 --> 19:56.540\n Twice.\n\n19:57.420 --> 19:59.860\n I said hi to him twice in the cafeteria.\n\n19:59.860 --> 20:01.020\n What did he say?\n\n20:01.020 --> 20:01.860\n Hi?\n\n20:01.860 --> 20:02.700\n He said, hey fellas.\n\n20:04.340 --> 20:05.940\n He was friendly.\n\n20:05.940 --> 20:08.260\n He was wandering around and with somebody,\n\n20:08.260 --> 20:12.300\n he couldn't find a table because the cafeteria was packed\n\n20:12.300 --> 20:13.700\n and I gave him my table.\n\n20:13.700 --> 20:16.060\n But I worked for Mike Colbert who talked to,\n\n20:16.060 --> 20:19.260\n like Mike was the unofficial CTO of Apple\n\n20:19.260 --> 20:22.140\n and a brilliant guy and he worked for Steve for 25 years,\n\n20:22.140 --> 20:25.540\n maybe more and he talked to Steve multiple times a day\n\n20:26.680 --> 20:29.380\n and he was one of the people who could put up with Steve's,\n\n20:29.380 --> 20:31.740\n let's say, brilliance and intensity\n\n20:31.740 --> 20:35.700\n and Steve really liked him and Steve trusted Mike\n\n20:35.700 --> 20:39.060\n to translate the shit he thought up\n\n20:39.060 --> 20:40.860\n into engineering products that work\n\n20:40.860 --> 20:43.140\n and then Mike ran a group called Platform Architecture\n\n20:43.140 --> 20:44.760\n and I was in that group.\n\n20:44.760 --> 20:46.380\n So many times I'd be sitting with Mike\n\n20:46.380 --> 20:48.680\n and the phone would ring and it'd be Steve\n\n20:48.680 --> 20:50.420\n and Mike would hold the phone like this\n\n20:50.420 --> 20:53.060\n because Steve would be yelling about something or other.\n\n20:53.060 --> 20:54.120\n And then he would translate.\n\n20:54.120 --> 20:55.900\n And he'd translate and then he would say,\n\n20:55.900 --> 20:58.300\n Steve wants us to do this.\n\n20:58.300 --> 20:59.460\n So.\n\n20:59.460 --> 21:01.100\n Was Steve a good engineer or no?\n\n21:01.100 --> 21:02.380\n I don't know.\n\n21:02.380 --> 21:03.780\n He was a great idea guy.\n\n21:03.780 --> 21:04.620\n Idea person.\n\n21:04.620 --> 21:07.540\n And he's a really good selector for talent.\n\n21:07.540 --> 21:09.580\n Yeah, that seems to be one of the key elements\n\n21:09.580 --> 21:10.740\n of leadership, right?\n\n21:10.740 --> 21:12.740\n And then he was a really good first principles guy.\n\n21:12.740 --> 21:15.060\n Like somebody would say something couldn't be done\n\n21:15.060 --> 21:20.060\n and he would just think, that's obviously wrong, right?\n\n21:20.300 --> 21:23.020\n But you know, maybe it's hard to do.\n\n21:23.020 --> 21:24.420\n Maybe it's expensive to do.\n\n21:24.420 --> 21:25.860\n Maybe we need different people.\n\n21:25.860 --> 21:27.260\n You know, there's like a whole bunch of,\n\n21:27.260 --> 21:29.420\n if you want to do something hard,\n\n21:29.420 --> 21:30.580\n you know, maybe it takes time.\n\n21:30.580 --> 21:31.580\n Maybe you have to iterate.\n\n21:31.580 --> 21:33.700\n There's a whole bunch of things you could think about\n\n21:33.700 --> 21:36.340\n but saying it can't be done is stupid.\n\n21:36.340 --> 21:38.060\n How would you compare?\n\n21:38.060 --> 21:42.860\n So it seems like Elon Musk is more engineering centric\n\n21:42.860 --> 21:45.660\n but is also, I think he considers himself a designer too.\n\n21:45.660 --> 21:46.980\n He has a design mind.\n\n21:46.980 --> 21:50.540\n Steve Jobs feels like he's much more idea space,\n\n21:50.540 --> 21:52.740\n design space versus engineering.\n\n21:52.740 --> 21:53.900\n Just make it happen.\n\n21:53.900 --> 21:55.820\n Like the world should be this way.\n\n21:55.820 --> 21:57.140\n Just figure it out.\n\n21:57.140 --> 21:58.680\n But he used computers.\n\n21:58.680 --> 22:01.840\n You know, he had computer people talk to him all the time.\n\n22:01.840 --> 22:03.340\n Like Mike was a really good computer guy.\n\n22:03.340 --> 22:04.820\n He knew computers could do.\n\n22:04.820 --> 22:06.300\n Computer meaning computer hardware?\n\n22:06.300 --> 22:09.100\n Like hardware, software, all the pieces.\n\n22:09.100 --> 22:12.100\n And then he would have an idea about\n\n22:12.100 --> 22:14.540\n what could we do with this next.\n\n22:14.540 --> 22:16.060\n That was grounded in reality.\n\n22:16.060 --> 22:19.220\n It wasn't like he was just finger painting on the wall\n\n22:19.220 --> 22:21.380\n and wishing somebody would interpret it.\n\n22:21.380 --> 22:23.420\n So he had this interesting connection\n\n22:23.420 --> 22:28.320\n because he wasn't a computer architect or designer\n\n22:28.320 --> 22:30.820\n but he had an intuition from the computers we had\n\n22:30.820 --> 22:31.960\n to what could happen.\n\n22:31.960 --> 22:35.280\n And it's interesting you say intuition\n\n22:35.280 --> 22:39.980\n because it seems like he was pissing off a lot of engineers\n\n22:39.980 --> 22:43.660\n in his intuition about what can and can't be done.\n\n22:43.660 --> 22:46.840\n Those, like the, what is all these stories\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:49.080\n about like floppy disks and all that kind of stuff.\n\n22:49.080 --> 22:52.080\n Yeah, so in Steve, the first round,\n\n22:52.080 --> 22:55.420\n like he'd go into a lab and look at what's going on\n\n22:55.420 --> 22:59.920\n and hate it and fire people or ask somebody\n\n22:59.920 --> 23:01.840\n in the elevator what they're doing for Apple.\n\n23:01.840 --> 23:03.840\n And not be happy.\n\n23:03.840 --> 23:06.520\n When he came back, my impression was\n\n23:06.520 --> 23:08.000\n is he surrounded himself\n\n23:08.000 --> 23:10.640\n with a relatively small group of people\n\n23:10.640 --> 23:13.880\n and didn't really interact outside of that as much.\n\n23:13.880 --> 23:16.320\n And then the joke was you'd see like somebody moving\n\n23:16.320 --> 23:20.800\n a prototype through the quad with a black blanket over it.\n\n23:20.800 --> 23:24.200\n And that was because it was secret, partly from Steve\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:26.980\n because they didn't want Steve to see it until it was ready.\n\n23:26.980 --> 23:31.420\n Yeah, the dynamic with Johnny Ive and Steve is interesting.\n\n23:31.420 --> 23:32.920\n It's like you don't wanna,\n\n23:34.200 --> 23:37.280\n he ruins as many ideas as he generates.\n\n23:37.280 --> 23:38.800\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n23:38.800 --> 23:42.080\n It's a dangerous kind of line to walk.\n\n23:42.080 --> 23:43.480\n If you have a lot of ideas,\n\n23:43.480 --> 23:47.260\n like Gordon Bell was famous for ideas, right?\n\n23:47.260 --> 23:49.120\n And it wasn't that the percentage of good ideas\n\n23:49.120 --> 23:51.420\n was way higher than anybody else.\n\n23:51.420 --> 23:53.160\n It was, he had so many ideas\n\n23:53.160 --> 23:55.840\n and he was also good at talking to people about it\n\n23:55.840 --> 23:58.120\n and getting the filters right.\n\n23:58.120 --> 24:00.200\n And seeing through stuff.\n\n24:00.200 --> 24:03.360\n Whereas Elon was like, hey, I wanna build rockets.\n\n24:03.360 --> 24:05.980\n So Steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys\n\n24:05.980 --> 24:08.520\n and Elon would go read rocket manuals.\n\n24:08.520 --> 24:11.440\n So Elon is a better engineer, a sense like,\n\n24:11.440 --> 24:16.440\n or like more like a love and passion for the manuals.\n\n24:16.880 --> 24:17.800\n And the details.\n\n24:17.800 --> 24:20.800\n The details, the craftsmanship too, right?\n\n24:20.800 --> 24:22.720\n Well, I guess Steve had craftsmanship too,\n\n24:22.720 --> 24:24.240\n but of a different kind.\n\n24:24.240 --> 24:26.200\n What do you make of the,\n\n24:26.200 --> 24:27.920\n just to stay in there for just a little longer,\n\n24:27.920 --> 24:29.200\n what do you make of like the anger\n\n24:29.200 --> 24:30.640\n and the passion and all of that?\n\n24:30.640 --> 24:35.080\n The firing and the mood swings and the madness,\n\n24:35.080 --> 24:39.360\n the being emotional and all of that, that's Steve.\n\n24:39.360 --> 24:40.680\n And I guess Elon too.\n\n24:40.680 --> 24:43.680\n So what, is that a bug or a feature?\n\n24:43.680 --> 24:45.020\n It's a feature.\n\n24:45.020 --> 24:50.020\n So there's a graph, which is Y axis productivity,\n\n24:50.240 --> 24:52.920\n X axis at zero is chaos,\n\n24:52.920 --> 24:56.280\n and infinity is complete order, right?\n\n24:56.280 --> 25:00.920\n So as you go from the origin,\n\n25:00.920 --> 25:04.160\n as you improve order, you improve productivity.\n\n25:04.160 --> 25:06.420\n And at some point, productivity peaks,\n\n25:06.420 --> 25:08.340\n and then it goes back down again.\n\n25:08.340 --> 25:09.800\n Too much order, nothing can happen.\n\n25:09.800 --> 25:10.640\n Yes.\n\n25:10.640 --> 25:13.680\n But the question is, how close to the chaos is that?\n\n25:13.680 --> 25:15.000\n No, no, no, here's the thing,\n\n25:15.000 --> 25:16.920\n is once you start moving in the direction of order,\n\n25:16.920 --> 25:21.000\n the force vector to drive you towards order is unstoppable.\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:22.240\n Oh, so it's a slippery slope.\n\n25:22.240 --> 25:24.880\n And every organization will move to the place\n\n25:24.880 --> 25:27.120\n where their productivity is stymied by order.\n\n25:27.120 --> 25:28.160\n So you need a...\n\n25:28.160 --> 25:30.360\n So the question is, who's the counter force?\n\n25:31.880 --> 25:33.360\n Because it also feels really good.\n\n25:33.360 --> 25:36.240\n As you get more organized, the productivity goes up.\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:39.720\n The organization feels it, they orient towards it, right?\n\n25:39.720 --> 25:41.080\n They hired more people.\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:42.880\n They got more guys who couldn't run process,\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:44.740\n you get bigger, right?\n\n25:44.740 --> 25:49.120\n And then inevitably, the organization gets captured\n\n25:49.120 --> 25:51.820\n by the bureaucracy that manages all the processes.\n\n25:51.820 --> 25:53.660\n Yeah.\n\n25:53.660 --> 25:55.540\n All right, and then humans really like that.\n\n25:55.540 --> 25:57.840\n And so if you just walk into a room and say,\n\n25:57.840 --> 26:00.140\n guys, love what you're doing,\n\n26:00.980 --> 26:03.340\n but I need you to have less order.\n\n26:04.980 --> 26:06.900\n If you don't have some force behind that,\n\n26:06.900 --> 26:07.900\n nothing will happen.\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:12.500\n I can't tell you on how many levels that's profound, so.\n\n26:12.500 --> 26:14.080\n So that's why I'd say it's a feature.\n\n26:14.080 --> 26:17.220\n Now, could you be nicer about it?\n\n26:17.220 --> 26:18.940\n I don't know, I don't know any good examples\n\n26:18.940 --> 26:20.140\n of being nicer about it.\n\n26:20.140 --> 26:23.460\n Well, the funny thing is to get stuff done,\n\n26:23.460 --> 26:25.940\n you need people who can manage stuff and manage people,\n\n26:25.940 --> 26:26.900\n because humans are complicated.\n\n26:26.900 --> 26:28.500\n They need lots of care and feeding that you need\n\n26:28.500 --> 26:30.780\n to tell them they look nice and they're doing good stuff\n\n26:30.780 --> 26:33.060\n and pat them on the back, right?\n\n26:33.060 --> 26:35.940\n I don't know, you tell me, is that needed?\n\n26:35.940 --> 26:36.780\n Oh yeah.\n\n26:36.780 --> 26:37.600\n Do humans need that?\n\n26:37.600 --> 26:39.660\n I had a friend, he started a magic group and he said,\n\n26:39.660 --> 26:40.820\n I figured it out.\n\n26:40.820 --> 26:43.380\n You have to praise them before they do anything.\n\n26:43.380 --> 26:45.220\n I was waiting until they were done.\n\n26:45.220 --> 26:46.520\n And they were always mad at me.\n\n26:46.520 --> 26:48.140\n Now I tell them what a great job they're doing\n\n26:48.140 --> 26:49.380\n while they're doing it.\n\n26:49.380 --> 26:51.020\n But then you get stuck in that trap,\n\n26:51.020 --> 26:52.180\n because then when they're not doing something,\n\n26:52.180 --> 26:54.060\n how do you confront these people?\n\n26:54.060 --> 26:55.900\n I think a lot of people that had trauma\n\n26:55.900 --> 26:57.540\n in their childhood would disagree with you,\n\n26:57.540 --> 27:00.640\n successful people, that you need to first do the rough stuff\n\n27:00.640 --> 27:02.320\n and then be nice later.\n\n27:02.320 --> 27:03.160\n I don't know.\n\n27:03.160 --> 27:05.820\n Okay, but engineering companies are full of adults\n\n27:05.820 --> 27:08.100\n who had all kinds of range of childhoods.\n\n27:08.100 --> 27:11.400\n You know, most people had okay childhoods.\n\n27:11.400 --> 27:12.900\n Well, I don't know if...\n\n27:12.900 --> 27:15.620\n Lots of people only work for praise, which is weird.\n\n27:15.620 --> 27:16.820\n You mean like everybody.\n\n27:16.820 --> 27:21.140\n I'm not that interested in it, but...\n\n27:21.140 --> 27:24.060\n Well, you're probably looking for somebody's approval.\n\n27:25.420 --> 27:27.400\n Even still.\n\n27:27.400 --> 27:28.240\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n27:28.240 --> 27:29.540\n I should think about that.\n\n27:29.540 --> 27:32.260\n Maybe somebody who's no longer with us kind of thing.\n\n27:33.160 --> 27:34.100\n I don't know.\n\n27:34.100 --> 27:36.340\n I used to call up my dad and tell him what I was doing.\n\n27:36.340 --> 27:38.580\n He was very excited about engineering and stuff.\n\n27:38.580 --> 27:40.140\n You got his approval?\n\n27:40.140 --> 27:42.060\n Uh, yeah, a lot.\n\n27:42.060 --> 27:43.340\n I was lucky.\n\n27:43.340 --> 27:47.180\n Like, he decided I was smart and unusual as a kid\n\n27:47.180 --> 27:49.280\n and that was okay when I was really young.\n\n27:50.180 --> 27:52.520\n So when I did poorly in school, I was dyslexic.\n\n27:52.520 --> 27:55.220\n I didn't read until I was third or fourth grade.\n\n27:55.220 --> 27:56.060\n They didn't care.\n\n27:56.060 --> 27:58.420\n My parents were like, oh, he'll be fine.\n\n27:59.760 --> 28:01.520\n So I was lucky.\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:02.480\n That was cool.\n\n28:02.480 --> 28:04.020\n Is he still with us?\n\n28:05.180 --> 28:06.020\n You miss him?\n\n28:07.500 --> 28:08.340\n Sure, yeah.\n\n28:08.340 --> 28:10.740\n He had Parkinson's and then cancer.\n\n28:10.740 --> 28:15.740\n His last 10 years were tough and I killed him.\n\n28:15.980 --> 28:18.280\n Killing a man like that's hard.\n\n28:18.280 --> 28:19.420\n The mind?\n\n28:19.420 --> 28:21.460\n Well, it's pretty good.\n\n28:21.460 --> 28:23.780\n Parkinson's causes slow dementia\n\n28:23.780 --> 28:27.740\n and the chemotherapy, I think, accelerated it.\n\n28:29.060 --> 28:31.020\n But it was like hallucinogenic dementia.\n\n28:31.020 --> 28:34.180\n So he was clever and funny and interesting\n\n28:34.180 --> 28:37.920\n and it was pretty unusual.\n\n28:37.920 --> 28:39.820\n Do you remember conversations?\n\n28:39.820 --> 28:41.500\n From that time?\n\n28:41.500 --> 28:43.940\n Like, do you have fond memories of the guy?\n\n28:43.940 --> 28:45.220\n Yeah, oh yeah.\n\n28:45.220 --> 28:46.280\n Anything come to mind?\n\n28:48.020 --> 28:50.340\n A friend told me one time I could draw a computer\n\n28:50.340 --> 28:52.500\n on the whiteboard faster than anybody he'd ever met.\n\n28:52.500 --> 28:54.060\n I said, you should meet my dad.\n\n28:54.920 --> 28:56.860\n Like, when I was a kid, he'd come home and say,\n\n28:56.860 --> 28:58.820\n I was driving by this bridge and I was thinking about it\n\n28:58.820 --> 28:59.780\n and he pulled out a piece of paper\n\n28:59.780 --> 29:01.500\n and he'd draw the whole bridge.\n\n29:01.500 --> 29:03.620\n He was a mechanical engineer.\n\n29:03.620 --> 29:05.000\n And he would just draw the whole thing\n\n29:05.000 --> 29:06.260\n and then he would tell me about it\n\n29:06.260 --> 29:08.700\n and then tell me how he would have changed it.\n\n29:08.700 --> 29:11.900\n And he had this idea that he could understand\n\n29:11.900 --> 29:13.380\n and conceive anything.\n\n29:13.380 --> 29:16.460\n And I just grew up with that, so that was natural.\n\n29:16.460 --> 29:19.780\n So when I interview people, I ask them to draw a picture\n\n29:19.780 --> 29:21.780\n of something they did on a whiteboard\n\n29:21.780 --> 29:22.860\n and it's really interesting.\n\n29:22.860 --> 29:24.700\n Like, some people draw a little box\n\n29:25.900 --> 29:27.820\n and then they'll say, and then this talks to this\n\n29:27.820 --> 29:30.220\n and I'll be like, oh, this is frustrating.\n\n29:30.220 --> 29:32.620\n I had this other guy come in one time, he says,\n\n29:32.620 --> 29:34.500\n well, I designed a floating point in this chip\n\n29:34.500 --> 29:36.320\n but I'd really like to tell you how the whole thing works\n\n29:36.320 --> 29:38.180\n and then tell you how the floating point works inside of it.\n\n29:38.180 --> 29:39.080\n Do you mind if I do that?\n\n29:39.080 --> 29:42.060\n And he covered two whiteboards in like 30 minutes\n\n29:42.060 --> 29:42.900\n and I hired him.\n\n29:42.900 --> 29:44.580\n Like, he was great.\n\n29:44.580 --> 29:45.420\n This is craftsman.\n\n29:45.420 --> 29:47.060\n I mean, that's the craftsmanship to that.\n\n29:47.060 --> 29:49.500\n Yeah, but also the mental agility\n\n29:49.500 --> 29:51.660\n to understand the whole thing,\n\n29:51.660 --> 29:53.580\n put the pieces in context,\n\n29:54.780 --> 29:57.700\n real view of the balance of how the design worked.\n\n29:58.640 --> 30:01.020\n Because if you don't understand it properly,\n\n30:01.020 --> 30:02.220\n when you start to draw it,\n\n30:02.220 --> 30:03.820\n you'll fill up half the whiteboard\n\n30:03.820 --> 30:05.220\n with like a little piece of it\n\n30:05.220 --> 30:09.260\n and like your ability to lay it out in an understandable way\n\n30:09.260 --> 30:11.500\n takes a lot of understanding, so.\n\n30:11.500 --> 30:13.460\n And be able to, so zoom into the detail\n\n30:13.460 --> 30:14.980\n and then zoom out to the big picture.\n\n30:14.980 --> 30:16.420\n Zoom out really fast.\n\n30:16.420 --> 30:17.620\n What about the impossible thing?\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:21.880\n You see, your dad believed that you can do anything.\n\n30:22.960 --> 30:25.500\n That's a weird feature for a craftsman.\n\n30:25.500 --> 30:26.700\n Yeah.\n\n30:26.700 --> 30:30.820\n It seems that that echoes in your own behavior.\n\n30:30.820 --> 30:32.100\n Like that's the.\n\n30:32.100 --> 30:36.500\n Well, it's not that anybody can do anything right now, right?\n\n30:36.500 --> 30:39.660\n It's that if you work at it, you can get better at it\n\n30:39.660 --> 30:41.220\n and there might not be a limit.\n\n30:43.100 --> 30:44.620\n And they did funny things like,\n\n30:44.620 --> 30:46.140\n like he always wanted to play piano.\n\n30:46.140 --> 30:48.460\n So at the end of his life, he started playing the piano\n\n30:48.460 --> 30:51.580\n when he had Parkinson's and he was terrible.\n\n30:51.580 --> 30:53.540\n But he thought if he really worked out in this life,\n\n30:53.540 --> 30:56.420\n maybe the next life he'd be better at it.\n\n30:56.420 --> 30:57.620\n He might be onto something.\n\n30:57.620 --> 31:00.940\n Yeah, he enjoyed doing it.\n\n31:00.940 --> 31:01.780\n Yeah.\n\n31:01.780 --> 31:02.620\n It's pretty funny.\n\n31:02.620 --> 31:06.180\n Do you think the perfect is the enemy of the good\n\n31:06.180 --> 31:08.180\n in hardware and software engineering?\n\n31:08.180 --> 31:10.500\n It's like we were talking about JavaScript a little bit\n\n31:10.500 --> 31:14.780\n and the messiness of the 10 day building process.\n\n31:14.780 --> 31:17.140\n Yeah, you know, creative tension, right?\n\n31:19.060 --> 31:21.460\n So creative tension is you have two different ideas\n\n31:21.460 --> 31:24.380\n that you can't do both, right?\n\n31:24.380 --> 31:27.660\n And, but the fact that you wanna do both\n\n31:27.660 --> 31:29.980\n causes you to go try to solve that problem.\n\n31:29.980 --> 31:32.020\n That's the creative part.\n\n31:32.020 --> 31:35.140\n So if you're building computers,\n\n31:35.140 --> 31:37.060\n like some people say we have the schedule\n\n31:37.060 --> 31:40.220\n and anything that doesn't fit in the schedule we can't do.\n\n31:40.220 --> 31:41.060\n Right?\n\n31:41.060 --> 31:42.100\n And so they throw out the perfect\n\n31:42.100 --> 31:44.300\n because they have a schedule.\n\n31:44.300 --> 31:45.140\n I hate that.\n\n31:46.620 --> 31:48.220\n Then there's other people who say\n\n31:48.220 --> 31:50.540\n we need to get this perfectly right.\n\n31:50.540 --> 31:53.980\n And no matter what, you know, more people, more money,\n\n31:53.980 --> 31:55.500\n right?\n\n31:55.500 --> 31:57.860\n And there's a really clear idea about what you want.\n\n31:57.860 --> 32:00.740\n Some people are really good at articulating it, right?\n\n32:00.740 --> 32:02.380\n So let's call that the perfect, yeah.\n\n32:02.380 --> 32:03.300\n Yeah.\n\n32:03.300 --> 32:04.780\n All right, but that's also terrible\n\n32:04.780 --> 32:06.180\n because they never ship anything.\n\n32:06.180 --> 32:07.420\n You never hit any goals.\n\n32:07.420 --> 32:09.980\n So now you have your framework.\n\n32:09.980 --> 32:10.820\n Yes.\n\n32:10.820 --> 32:11.660\n You can't throw out stuff\n\n32:11.660 --> 32:12.820\n because you can't get it done today\n\n32:12.820 --> 32:14.020\n because maybe you'll get it done tomorrow\n\n32:14.020 --> 32:15.860\n or the next project, right?\n\n32:15.860 --> 32:18.340\n You can't, so you have to,\n\n32:18.340 --> 32:20.620\n I work with a guy that I really like working with,\n\n32:20.620 --> 32:23.140\n but he over filters his ideas.\n\n32:23.140 --> 32:24.780\n Over filters?\n\n32:24.780 --> 32:26.620\n He'd start thinking about something\n\n32:26.620 --> 32:28.020\n and as soon as he figured out what was wrong with it,\n\n32:28.020 --> 32:28.900\n he'd throw it out.\n\n32:29.820 --> 32:31.260\n And then I start thinking about it\n\n32:31.260 --> 32:32.700\n and you come up with an idea\n\n32:32.700 --> 32:34.980\n and then you find out what's wrong with it.\n\n32:34.980 --> 32:36.780\n And then you give it a little time to set\n\n32:36.780 --> 32:39.260\n because sometimes you figure out how to tweak it\n\n32:39.260 --> 32:41.380\n or maybe that idea helps some other idea.\n\n32:42.620 --> 32:45.100\n So idea generation is really funny.\n\n32:45.100 --> 32:46.940\n So you have to give your ideas space.\n\n32:46.940 --> 32:49.780\n Like spaciousness of mind is key.\n\n32:49.780 --> 32:53.420\n But you also have to execute programs and get shit done.\n\n32:53.420 --> 32:55.540\n And then it turns out computer engineering is fun\n\n32:55.540 --> 32:58.300\n because it takes 100 people to build a computer,\n\n32:58.300 --> 33:00.620\n 200 or 300, whatever the number is.\n\n33:00.620 --> 33:05.260\n And people are so variable about temperament\n\n33:05.260 --> 33:07.700\n and skill sets and stuff.\n\n33:07.700 --> 33:09.460\n That in a big organization,\n\n33:09.460 --> 33:11.860\n you find the people who love the perfect ideas\n\n33:11.860 --> 33:13.780\n and the people that want to get stuffed on yesterday\n\n33:13.780 --> 33:16.500\n and people like to come up with ideas\n\n33:16.500 --> 33:19.300\n and people like to, let's say shoot down ideas.\n\n33:19.300 --> 33:23.300\n And it takes the whole, it takes a large group of people.\n\n33:23.300 --> 33:25.980\n Some are good at generating ideas, some are good at filtering ideas.\n\n33:25.980 --> 33:30.980\n And then all in that giant mess, you're somehow,\n\n33:30.980 --> 33:33.820\n I guess the goal is for that giant mess of people\n\n33:33.820 --> 33:37.260\n to find the perfect path through the tension,\n\n33:37.260 --> 33:38.460\n the creative tension.\n\n33:38.460 --> 33:41.340\n But like, how do you know when you said\n\n33:41.340 --> 33:42.940\n there's some people good at articulating\n\n33:42.940 --> 33:44.740\n what perfect looks like, what a good design is?\n\n33:44.740 --> 33:46.860\n Like if you're sitting in a room\n\n33:48.060 --> 33:51.020\n and you have a set of ideas\n\n33:51.020 --> 33:55.340\n about like how to design a better processor,\n\n33:55.340 --> 33:58.820\n how do you know this is something special here?\n\n33:58.820 --> 34:00.780\n This is a good idea, let's try this.\n\n34:00.780 --> 34:02.220\n Have you ever brainstormed an idea\n\n34:02.220 --> 34:04.540\n with a couple of people that were really smart?\n\n34:04.540 --> 34:07.540\n And you kind of go into it and you don't quite understand it\n\n34:07.540 --> 34:09.700\n and you're working on it.\n\n34:09.700 --> 34:12.180\n And then you start talking about it,\n\n34:12.180 --> 34:16.140\n putting it on the whiteboard, maybe it takes days or weeks.\n\n34:16.140 --> 34:18.620\n And then your brain starts to kind of synchronize.\n\n34:18.620 --> 34:19.540\n It's really weird.\n\n34:19.540 --> 34:23.020\n Like you start to see what each other is thinking.\n\n34:25.980 --> 34:28.460\n And it starts to work.\n\n34:28.460 --> 34:29.380\n Like you can see work.\n\n34:29.380 --> 34:30.980\n Like my talent in computer design\n\n34:30.980 --> 34:35.340\n is I can see how computers work in my head, like really well.\n\n34:35.340 --> 34:37.340\n And I know other people can do that too.\n\n34:37.340 --> 34:40.460\n And when you're working with people that can do that,\n\n34:40.460 --> 34:44.460\n like it is kind of an amazing experience.\n\n34:45.380 --> 34:48.180\n And then every once in a while you get to that place\n\n34:48.180 --> 34:50.220\n and then you find the flaw, which is kind of funny\n\n34:50.220 --> 34:52.340\n because you can fool yourself.\n\n34:53.740 --> 34:55.900\n The two of you kind of drifted along\n\n34:55.900 --> 34:58.460\n in the direction that was useless.\n\n34:58.460 --> 34:59.420\n That happens too.\n\n34:59.420 --> 35:03.500\n Like you have to, because the nice thing\n\n35:03.500 --> 35:05.580\n about computer design is always reduction in practice.\n\n35:05.580 --> 35:08.100\n Like you come up with your good ideas\n\n35:08.100 --> 35:10.980\n and I know some architects who really love ideas\n\n35:10.980 --> 35:13.100\n and then they work on them and they put it on the shelf\n\n35:13.100 --> 35:14.820\n and they go work on the next idea and put it on the shelf\n\n35:14.820 --> 35:16.820\n and they never reduce it to practice.\n\n35:16.820 --> 35:18.780\n So they find out what's good and bad.\n\n35:18.780 --> 35:22.500\n Because almost every time I've done something really new,\n\n35:22.500 --> 35:25.660\n by the time it's done, like the good parts are good,\n\n35:25.660 --> 35:27.620\n but I know all the flaws, like.\n\n35:27.620 --> 35:28.460\n Yeah.\n\n35:28.460 --> 35:31.580\n Would you say your career, just your own experience,\n\n35:31.580 --> 35:35.260\n is your career defined mostly by flaws or by successes?\n\n35:35.260 --> 35:36.100\n Like if...\n\n35:36.100 --> 35:38.020\n Again, there's great tension between those.\n\n35:38.020 --> 35:42.580\n If you haven't tried hard, right?\n\n35:42.580 --> 35:46.300\n And done something new, right?\n\n35:46.300 --> 35:48.500\n Then you're not gonna be facing the challenges\n\n35:48.500 --> 35:49.340\n when you build it.\n\n35:49.340 --> 35:51.900\n Then you find out all the problems with it.\n\n35:51.900 --> 35:52.740\n And...\n\n35:52.740 --> 35:55.580\n But when you look back, do you see problems?\n\n35:55.580 --> 35:56.420\n Okay.\n\n35:56.420 --> 35:58.060\n Oh, when I look back?\n\n35:58.060 --> 35:58.900\n What do you remember?\n\n35:58.900 --> 36:00.460\n I think earlier in my career,\n\n36:00.460 --> 36:02.680\n like EV5 was the second alpha chip.\n\n36:04.100 --> 36:06.500\n I was so embarrassed about the mistakes,\n\n36:06.500 --> 36:08.580\n I could barely talk about it.\n\n36:08.580 --> 36:10.340\n And it was in the Guinness Book of World Records\n\n36:10.340 --> 36:12.420\n and it was the fastest processor on the planet.\n\n36:12.420 --> 36:13.740\n Yeah.\n\n36:13.740 --> 36:15.780\n So it was, and at some point I realized\n\n36:15.780 --> 36:18.540\n that was really a bad mental framework\n\n36:18.540 --> 36:20.020\n to deal with doing something new.\n\n36:20.020 --> 36:21.180\n We did a bunch of new things\n\n36:21.180 --> 36:23.460\n and some worked out great and some were bad.\n\n36:23.460 --> 36:24.660\n And we learned a lot from it.\n\n36:24.660 --> 36:28.020\n And then the next one, we learned a lot.\n\n36:28.020 --> 36:31.820\n That EV6 also had some really cool things in it.\n\n36:31.820 --> 36:34.240\n I think the proportion of good stuff went up,\n\n36:34.240 --> 36:38.660\n but it had a couple of fatal flaws in it that were painful.\n\n36:39.580 --> 36:41.500\n And then, yeah.\n\n36:41.500 --> 36:44.660\n You learned to channel the pain into like pride.\n\n36:44.660 --> 36:45.740\n Not pride, really.\n\n36:45.740 --> 36:50.060\n You know, just a realization about how the world works\n\n36:50.060 --> 36:52.300\n or how that kind of idea set works.\n\n36:52.300 --> 36:53.220\n Life is suffering.\n\n36:53.220 --> 36:54.280\n That's the reality.\n\n36:55.540 --> 36:57.140\n No, it's not.\n\n36:57.140 --> 36:58.380\n Well, I know the Buddha said that\n\n36:58.380 --> 37:00.480\n and a couple other people are stuck on it.\n\n37:00.480 --> 37:03.820\n No, it's, you know, there's this kind of weird combination\n\n37:03.820 --> 37:06.940\n of good and bad, you know, light and darkness\n\n37:06.940 --> 37:10.260\n that you have to tolerate and, you know, deal with.\n\n37:10.260 --> 37:12.620\n Yeah, there's definitely lots of suffering in the world.\n\n37:12.620 --> 37:13.780\n Depends on the perspective.\n\n37:13.780 --> 37:15.420\n It seems like there's way more darkness,\n\n37:15.420 --> 37:18.620\n but that makes the light part really nice.\n\n37:18.620 --> 37:23.620\n What computing hardware or just any kind,\n\n37:24.780 --> 37:28.760\n even software design, do you find beautiful\n\n37:28.760 --> 37:32.500\n from your own work, from other people's work?\n\n37:32.500 --> 37:37.340\n You're just, we were just talking about the battleground\n\n37:37.340 --> 37:39.260\n of flaws and mistakes and errors,\n\n37:39.260 --> 37:42.540\n but things that were just beautifully done.\n\n37:42.540 --> 37:44.500\n Is there something that pops to mind?\n\n37:44.500 --> 37:47.900\n Well, when things are beautifully done,\n\n37:47.900 --> 37:52.600\n usually there's a well thought out set of abstraction layers.\n\n37:53.660 --> 37:56.420\n So the whole thing works in unison nicely.\n\n37:56.420 --> 37:57.380\n Yes.\n\n37:57.380 --> 37:59.380\n And when I say abstraction layer,\n\n37:59.380 --> 38:01.180\n that means two different components\n\n38:01.180 --> 38:04.940\n when they work together, they work independently.\n\n38:04.940 --> 38:07.740\n They don't have to know what the other one is doing.\n\n38:07.740 --> 38:08.660\n So that decoupling.\n\n38:08.660 --> 38:09.500\n Yeah.\n\n38:09.500 --> 38:11.500\n So the famous one was the network stack.\n\n38:11.500 --> 38:13.100\n Like there's a seven layer network stack,\n\n38:13.100 --> 38:16.380\n you know, data transport and protocol and all the layers.\n\n38:16.380 --> 38:17.580\n And the innovation was,\n\n38:17.580 --> 38:20.000\n is when they really wrote, got that right.\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:22.940\n Cause networks before that didn't define those very well.\n\n38:22.940 --> 38:26.220\n The layers could innovate independently.\n\n38:26.220 --> 38:28.780\n And occasionally the layer boundary would,\n\n38:28.780 --> 38:30.980\n the interface would be upgraded.\n\n38:30.980 --> 38:34.780\n And that let the design space breathe.\n\n38:34.780 --> 38:37.860\n And you could do something new in layer seven\n\n38:37.860 --> 38:40.620\n without having to worry about how layer four worked.\n\n38:40.620 --> 38:43.000\n And so good design does that.\n\n38:43.000 --> 38:45.220\n And you see it in processor designs.\n\n38:45.220 --> 38:48.580\n When we did the Zen design at AMD,\n\n38:48.580 --> 38:51.940\n we made several components very modular.\n\n38:51.940 --> 38:54.700\n And, you know, my insistence at the top was\n\n38:54.700 --> 38:56.620\n I wanted all the interfaces defined\n\n38:56.620 --> 38:59.320\n before we wrote the RTL for the pieces.\n\n38:59.320 --> 39:01.060\n One of the verification leads said,\n\n39:01.060 --> 39:02.220\n if we do this right,\n\n39:02.220 --> 39:04.900\n I can test the pieces so well independently\n\n39:04.900 --> 39:06.440\n when we put it together,\n\n39:06.440 --> 39:08.140\n we won't find all these interaction bugs\n\n39:08.140 --> 39:10.700\n cause the floating point knows how the cache works.\n\n39:10.700 --> 39:12.020\n And I was a little skeptical,\n\n39:12.020 --> 39:14.220\n but he was mostly right.\n\n39:14.220 --> 39:16.700\n That the modularity of the design\n\n39:16.700 --> 39:18.960\n greatly improved the quality.\n\n39:18.960 --> 39:20.540\n Is that universally true in general?\n\n39:20.540 --> 39:21.860\n Would you say about good designs,\n\n39:21.860 --> 39:24.180\n the modularity is like usually modular?\n\n39:24.180 --> 39:25.180\n Well, we talked about this before.\n\n39:25.180 --> 39:26.420\n Humans are only so smart.\n\n39:26.420 --> 39:29.460\n Like, and we're not getting any smarter, right?\n\n39:29.460 --> 39:32.260\n But the complexity of things is going up.\n\n39:32.260 --> 39:36.200\n So, you know, a beautiful design can't be bigger\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:37.960\n than the person doing it.\n\n39:37.960 --> 39:40.020\n It's just, you know, their piece of it.\n\n39:40.020 --> 39:42.420\n Like the odds of you doing a really beautiful design\n\n39:42.420 --> 39:46.560\n of something that's way too hard for you is low, right?\n\n39:46.560 --> 39:48.000\n If it's way too simple for you,\n\n39:48.000 --> 39:49.020\n it's not that interesting.\n\n39:49.020 --> 39:50.600\n It's like, well, anybody could do that.\n\n39:50.600 --> 39:54.720\n But when you get the right match of your expertise\n\n39:54.720 --> 39:58.680\n and, you know, mental power to the right design size,\n\n39:58.680 --> 40:00.400\n that's cool, but that's not big enough\n\n40:00.400 --> 40:02.220\n to make a meaningful impact in the world.\n\n40:02.220 --> 40:04.900\n So now you have to have some framework\n\n40:04.900 --> 40:08.060\n to design the pieces so that the whole thing\n\n40:08.060 --> 40:10.060\n is big and harmonious.\n\n40:10.060 --> 40:13.520\n But, you know, when you put it together,\n\n40:13.520 --> 40:18.520\n it's, you know, sufficiently interesting to be used.\n\n40:18.900 --> 40:21.400\n And, you know, so that's what a beautiful design is.\n\n40:23.300 --> 40:27.960\n Matching the limits of that human cognitive capacity\n\n40:27.960 --> 40:30.300\n to the module that you can create\n\n40:30.300 --> 40:33.100\n and creating a nice interface between those modules\n\n40:33.100 --> 40:34.500\n and thereby, do you think there's a limit\n\n40:34.500 --> 40:37.080\n to the kind of beautiful complex systems\n\n40:37.080 --> 40:40.980\n we can build with this kind of modular design?\n\n40:40.980 --> 40:45.900\n It's like, you know, if we build increasingly\n\n40:45.900 --> 40:48.500\n more complicated, you can think of like the internet.\n\n40:49.500 --> 40:50.900\n Okay, let's scale it down.\n\n40:50.900 --> 40:52.300\n Or you can think of like social network,\n\n40:52.300 --> 40:56.320\n like Twitter as one computing system.\n\n40:57.740 --> 41:00.700\n But those are little modules, right?\n\n41:00.700 --> 41:03.780\n But it's built on so many components\n\n41:03.780 --> 41:05.980\n nobody at Twitter even understands.\n\n41:05.980 --> 41:06.820\n Right.\n\n41:06.820 --> 41:09.300\n So if an alien showed up and looked at Twitter,\n\n41:09.300 --> 41:11.180\n he wouldn't just see Twitter as a beautiful,\n\n41:11.180 --> 41:14.420\n simple thing that everybody uses, which is really big.\n\n41:14.420 --> 41:18.180\n You would see the network, it runs on the fiber optics,\n\n41:18.180 --> 41:19.880\n the data is transported to the computers.\n\n41:19.880 --> 41:22.060\n The whole thing is so bloody complicated,\n\n41:22.060 --> 41:23.760\n nobody at Twitter understands it.\n\n41:23.760 --> 41:25.760\n And so that's what the alien would see.\n\n41:25.760 --> 41:28.820\n So yeah, if an alien showed up and looked at Twitter\n\n41:28.820 --> 41:32.060\n or looked at the various different network systems\n\n41:32.060 --> 41:33.700\n that you could see on Earth.\n\n41:33.700 --> 41:34.980\n So imagine they were really smart\n\n41:34.980 --> 41:36.700\n and they could comprehend the whole thing.\n\n41:36.700 --> 41:40.140\n And then they sort of evaluated the human\n\n41:40.140 --> 41:41.540\n and thought, this is really interesting.\n\n41:41.540 --> 41:44.620\n No human on this planet comprehends the system they built.\n\n41:45.500 --> 41:48.900\n No individual, well, would they even see individual humans?\n\n41:48.900 --> 41:52.720\n Like we humans are very human centric, entity centric.\n\n41:52.720 --> 41:56.860\n And so we think of us as the central organism\n\n41:56.860 --> 41:59.820\n and the networks as just the connection of organisms.\n\n41:59.820 --> 42:02.500\n But from a perspective of an alien,\n\n42:02.500 --> 42:05.380\n from an outside perspective, it seems like.\n\n42:05.380 --> 42:06.980\n Yeah, I get it.\n\n42:06.980 --> 42:08.940\n We're the ants and they'd see the ant colony.\n\n42:08.940 --> 42:10.500\n The ant colony, yeah.\n\n42:10.500 --> 42:12.780\n Or the result of production of the ant colony,\n\n42:12.780 --> 42:16.020\n which is like cities and it's,\n\n42:18.100 --> 42:19.880\n in that sense, humans are pretty impressive.\n\n42:19.880 --> 42:21.860\n The modularity that we're able to,\n\n42:23.120 --> 42:25.940\n and how robust we are to noise and mutation\n\n42:25.940 --> 42:26.780\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n42:26.780 --> 42:28.540\n Well, that's because it's stress tested all the time.\n\n42:28.540 --> 42:29.380\n Yeah.\n\n42:29.380 --> 42:31.060\n You know, you build all these cities with buildings\n\n42:31.060 --> 42:32.420\n and you get earthquakes occasionally\n\n42:32.420 --> 42:35.540\n and, you know, wars, earthquakes.\n\n42:35.540 --> 42:37.620\n Viruses every once in a while.\n\n42:37.620 --> 42:39.500\n You know, changes in business plans\n\n42:39.500 --> 42:41.620\n or, you know, like shipping or something.\n\n42:41.620 --> 42:44.740\n Like as long as it's all stress tested,\n\n42:44.740 --> 42:48.560\n then it keeps adapting to the situation.\n\n42:48.560 --> 42:52.540\n So that's a curious phenomenon.\n\n42:52.540 --> 42:55.060\n Well, let's go, let's talk about Moore's Law a little bit.\n\n42:55.060 --> 43:00.060\n It's at the broad view of Moore's Law\n\n43:00.060 --> 43:05.060\n was just exponential improvement of computing capability.\n\n43:05.260 --> 43:08.380\n Like OpenAI, for example, recently published\n\n43:08.380 --> 43:13.380\n this kind of papers looking at the exponential improvement\n\n43:14.060 --> 43:17.020\n in the training efficiency of neural networks\n\n43:17.020 --> 43:18.620\n for like ImageNet and all that kind of stuff.\n\n43:18.620 --> 43:22.300\n We just got better on this purely software side,\n\n43:22.300 --> 43:25.620\n just figuring out better tricks and algorithms\n\n43:25.620 --> 43:26.980\n for training neural networks.\n\n43:26.980 --> 43:30.620\n And that seems to be improving significantly faster\n\n43:30.620 --> 43:33.100\n than the Moore's Law prediction, you know.\n\n43:33.100 --> 43:35.300\n So that's in the software space.\n\n43:35.300 --> 43:39.140\n What do you think if Moore's Law continues\n\n43:39.140 --> 43:42.900\n or if the general version of Moore's Law continues,\n\n43:42.900 --> 43:45.320\n do you think that comes mostly from the hardware,\n\n43:45.320 --> 43:47.580\n from the software, some mix of the two,\n\n43:47.580 --> 43:50.000\n some interesting, totally,\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:52.800\n so not the reduction of the size of the transistor\n\n43:52.800 --> 43:54.420\n kind of thing, but more in the,\n\n43:54.420 --> 43:58.940\n in the totally interesting kinds of innovations\n\n43:58.940 --> 44:01.260\n in the hardware space, all that kind of stuff.\n\n44:01.260 --> 44:04.060\n Well, there's like a half a dozen things\n\n44:04.060 --> 44:05.580\n going on in that graph.\n\n44:05.580 --> 44:08.500\n So one is there's initial innovations\n\n44:08.500 --> 44:11.660\n that had a lot of headroom to be exploited.\n\n44:11.660 --> 44:13.980\n So, you know, the efficiency of the networks\n\n44:13.980 --> 44:15.900\n has improved dramatically.\n\n44:15.900 --> 44:19.660\n And then the decomposability of those and the use going,\n\n44:19.660 --> 44:21.380\n you know, they started running on one computer,\n\n44:21.380 --> 44:23.740\n then multiple computers, then multiple GPUs,\n\n44:23.740 --> 44:27.100\n and then arrays of GPUs, and they're up to thousands.\n\n44:27.100 --> 44:30.620\n And at some point, so it's sort of like\n\n44:30.620 --> 44:32.300\n they were consumed, they were going from\n\n44:32.300 --> 44:33.860\n like a single computer application\n\n44:33.860 --> 44:36.240\n to a thousand computer application.\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:38.200\n So that's not really a Moore's Law thing.\n\n44:38.200 --> 44:39.520\n That's an independent vector.\n\n44:39.520 --> 44:42.340\n How many computers can I put on this problem?\n\n44:42.340 --> 44:44.220\n Because the computers themselves are getting better\n\n44:44.220 --> 44:45.980\n on like a Moore's Law rate,\n\n44:45.980 --> 44:47.900\n but their ability to go from one to 10\n\n44:47.900 --> 44:51.180\n to 100 to a thousand, you know, was something.\n\n44:51.180 --> 44:54.300\n And then multiplied by, you know, the amount of computes\n\n44:54.300 --> 44:58.300\n it took to resolve like AlexNet to ResNet to transformers.\n\n44:58.300 --> 45:01.700\n It's been quite, you know, steady improvements.\n\n45:01.700 --> 45:03.300\n But those are like S curves, aren't they?\n\n45:03.300 --> 45:04.940\n That's the exactly kind of S curves\n\n45:04.940 --> 45:07.620\n that are underlying Moore's Law from the very beginning.\n\n45:07.620 --> 45:12.620\n So what's the biggest, what's the most productive,\n\n45:13.380 --> 45:16.740\n rich source of S curves in the future, do you think?\n\n45:16.740 --> 45:18.780\n Is it hardware, is it software, or is it?\n\n45:18.780 --> 45:23.660\n So hardware is going to move along relatively slowly.\n\n45:23.660 --> 45:26.660\n Like, you know, double performance every two years.\n\n45:26.660 --> 45:28.380\n There's still...\n\n45:28.380 --> 45:29.620\n I like how you call that slowly.\n\n45:29.620 --> 45:31.460\n Yeah, that's the slow version.\n\n45:31.460 --> 45:33.220\n The snail's pace of Moore's Law.\n\n45:33.220 --> 45:37.580\n Maybe we should trademark that one.\n\n45:39.100 --> 45:41.980\n Whereas the scaling by number of computers, you know,\n\n45:41.980 --> 45:44.020\n can go much faster, you know.\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:46.380\n I'm sure at some point Google had a, you know,\n\n45:46.380 --> 45:48.900\n their initial search engine was running on a laptop,\n\n45:48.900 --> 45:50.140\n you know, like.\n\n45:50.140 --> 45:52.580\n And at some point they really worked on scaling that.\n\n45:52.580 --> 45:55.940\n And then they factored the indexer from, you know,\n\n45:55.940 --> 45:57.500\n this piece and this piece and this piece,\n\n45:57.500 --> 45:59.340\n and they spread the data on more and more things.\n\n45:59.340 --> 46:02.820\n And, you know, they did a dozen innovations.\n\n46:02.820 --> 46:05.420\n But as they scaled up the number of computers on that,\n\n46:05.420 --> 46:07.500\n it kept breaking, finding new bottlenecks\n\n46:07.500 --> 46:09.220\n in their software and their schedulers,\n\n46:09.220 --> 46:11.780\n and made them rethink.\n\n46:11.780 --> 46:13.980\n Like, it seems insane to do a scheduler\n\n46:13.980 --> 46:16.700\n across 1,000 computers to schedule parts of it\n\n46:16.700 --> 46:19.020\n and then send the results to one computer.\n\n46:19.020 --> 46:21.380\n But if you want to schedule a million searches,\n\n46:21.380 --> 46:23.180\n that makes perfect sense.\n\n46:23.180 --> 46:26.860\n So there's the scaling by just quantity\n\n46:26.860 --> 46:28.980\n is probably the richest thing.\n\n46:28.980 --> 46:31.980\n But then as you scale quantity,\n\n46:31.980 --> 46:34.660\n like a network that was great on 100 computers\n\n46:34.660 --> 46:36.580\n may be completely the wrong one.\n\n46:36.580 --> 46:39.620\n You may pick a network that's 10 times slower\n\n46:39.620 --> 46:42.540\n on 10,000 computers, like per computer.\n\n46:42.540 --> 46:45.820\n But if you go from 100 to 10,000, it's 100 times.\n\n46:45.820 --> 46:47.220\n So that's one of the things that happened\n\n46:47.220 --> 46:48.740\n when we did internet scaling.\n\n46:48.740 --> 46:52.580\n This efficiency went down, not up.\n\n46:52.580 --> 46:55.500\n The future of computing is inefficiency, not efficiency.\n\n46:55.500 --> 46:57.620\n But scale, inefficient scale.\n\n46:57.620 --> 47:01.860\n It's scaling faster than inefficiency bites you.\n\n47:01.860 --> 47:03.860\n And as long as there's, you know, dollar value there,\n\n47:03.860 --> 47:05.980\n like scaling costs lots of money.\n\n47:05.980 --> 47:08.220\n But Google showed, Facebook showed, everybody showed\n\n47:08.220 --> 47:10.740\n that the scale was where the money was at.\n\n47:10.740 --> 47:13.780\n It was, and so it was worth the financial.\n\n47:13.780 --> 47:17.780\n Do you think, is it possible that like basically\n\n47:17.780 --> 47:21.800\n the entirety of Earth will be like a computing surface?\n\n47:21.800 --> 47:24.460\n Like this table will be doing computing.\n\n47:24.460 --> 47:26.140\n This hedgehog will be doing computing.\n\n47:26.140 --> 47:28.180\n Like everything really inefficient,\n\n47:28.180 --> 47:29.500\n dumb computing will be leveraged.\n\n47:29.500 --> 47:31.820\n The science fiction books, they call it computronium.\n\n47:31.820 --> 47:32.660\n Computronium?\n\n47:32.660 --> 47:34.700\n We turn everything into computing.\n\n47:34.700 --> 47:37.980\n Well, most of the elements aren't very good for anything.\n\n47:37.980 --> 47:39.940\n Like you're not gonna make a computer out of iron.\n\n47:39.940 --> 47:44.120\n Like, you know, silicon and carbon have like nice structures.\n\n47:45.020 --> 47:48.060\n You know, we'll see what you can do with the rest of it.\n\n47:48.060 --> 47:50.380\n Like people talk about, well, maybe we can turn the sun\n\n47:50.380 --> 47:54.980\n into computer, but it's hydrogen and a little bit of helium.\n\n47:54.980 --> 47:55.820\n So.\n\n47:55.820 --> 47:59.060\n What I mean is more like actually just adding computers\n\n47:59.060 --> 47:59.940\n to everything.\n\n47:59.940 --> 48:00.780\n Oh, okay.\n\n48:00.780 --> 48:03.100\n So you're just converting all the mass of the universe\n\n48:03.100 --> 48:04.260\n into computer.\n\n48:04.260 --> 48:05.100\n No, no, no.\n\n48:05.100 --> 48:05.920\n So not using.\n\n48:05.920 --> 48:07.580\n It'd be ironic from the simulation point of view.\n\n48:07.580 --> 48:10.720\n It's like the simulator build mass, the simulates.\n\n48:12.020 --> 48:12.860\n Yeah, I mean, yeah.\n\n48:12.860 --> 48:14.940\n So, I mean, ultimately this is all heading\n\n48:14.940 --> 48:15.780\n towards a simulation.\n\n48:15.780 --> 48:18.460\n Yeah, well, I think I might've told you this story.\n\n48:18.460 --> 48:20.280\n At Tesla, they were deciding,\n\n48:20.280 --> 48:22.420\n so they wanna measure the current coming out of the battery\n\n48:22.420 --> 48:25.900\n and they decided between putting the resistor in there\n\n48:25.900 --> 48:29.460\n and putting a computer with a sensor in there.\n\n48:29.460 --> 48:31.940\n And the computer was faster than the computer\n\n48:31.940 --> 48:34.140\n I worked on in 1982.\n\n48:34.140 --> 48:35.560\n And we chose the computer\n\n48:35.560 --> 48:37.620\n because it was cheaper than the resistor.\n\n48:38.660 --> 48:42.340\n So, sure, this hedgehog costs $13\n\n48:42.340 --> 48:45.160\n and we can put an AI that's as smart as you\n\n48:45.160 --> 48:46.060\n in there for five bucks.\n\n48:46.060 --> 48:46.900\n It'll have one.\n\n48:48.560 --> 48:51.780\n So computers will be everywhere.\n\n48:51.780 --> 48:54.620\n I was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than me because.\n\n48:54.620 --> 48:56.660\n Well, everything's gonna be smarter than you.\n\n48:56.660 --> 48:58.060\n But you were saying it's inefficient.\n\n48:58.060 --> 49:00.240\n I thought it was better to have a lot of dumb things.\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:02.740\n Well, Moore's law will slowly compact that stuff.\n\n49:02.740 --> 49:04.860\n So even the dumb things will be smarter than us.\n\n49:04.860 --> 49:06.020\n The dumb things are gonna be smart\n\n49:06.020 --> 49:08.020\n or they're gonna be smart enough to talk to something\n\n49:08.020 --> 49:09.040\n that's really smart.\n\n49:10.140 --> 49:11.140\n You know, it's like.\n\n49:12.580 --> 49:15.220\n Well, just remember, like a big computer chip.\n\n49:15.220 --> 49:16.060\n Yeah.\n\n49:16.060 --> 49:17.620\n You know, it's like an inch by an inch\n\n49:17.620 --> 49:20.120\n and, you know, 40 microns thick.\n\n49:20.980 --> 49:23.340\n It doesn't take very much, very many atoms\n\n49:23.340 --> 49:25.020\n to make a high power computer.\n\n49:25.020 --> 49:25.860\n Yeah.\n\n49:25.860 --> 49:27.800\n And 10,000 of them can fit in a shoebox.\n\n49:29.060 --> 49:31.500\n But, you know, you have the cooling and power problems,\n\n49:31.500 --> 49:33.540\n but, you know, people are working on that.\n\n49:33.540 --> 49:37.660\n But they still can't write compelling poetry or music\n\n49:37.660 --> 49:41.740\n or understand what love is or have a fear of mortality.\n\n49:41.740 --> 49:43.500\n So we're still winning.\n\n49:43.500 --> 49:46.180\n Neither can most of humanity, so.\n\n49:46.180 --> 49:48.280\n Well, they can write books about it.\n\n49:48.280 --> 49:52.460\n So, but speaking about this,\n\n49:53.900 --> 49:56.860\n this walk along the path of innovation\n\n49:56.860 --> 50:00.100\n towards the dumb things being smarter than humans,\n\n50:00.100 --> 50:05.100\n you are now the CTO of 10storrent as of two months ago.\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:12.020\n They build hardware for deep learning.\n\n50:13.780 --> 50:16.140\n How do you build scalable and efficient deep learning?\n\n50:16.140 --> 50:17.460\n This is such a fascinating space.\n\n50:17.460 --> 50:18.740\n Yeah, yeah, so it's interesting.\n\n50:18.740 --> 50:20.780\n So up until recently,\n\n50:20.780 --> 50:22.340\n I thought there was two kinds of computers.\n\n50:22.340 --> 50:25.380\n There are serial computers that run like C programs,\n\n50:25.380 --> 50:27.100\n and then there's parallel computers.\n\n50:27.100 --> 50:29.340\n So the way I think about it is, you know,\n\n50:29.340 --> 50:31.900\n parallel computers have given parallelism.\n\n50:31.900 --> 50:34.780\n Like, GPUs are great because you have a million pixels,\n\n50:34.780 --> 50:37.500\n and modern GPUs run a program on every pixel.\n\n50:37.500 --> 50:39.340\n They call it the shader program, right?\n\n50:39.340 --> 50:42.460\n So, or like finite element analysis.\n\n50:42.460 --> 50:43.900\n You build something, you know,\n\n50:43.900 --> 50:45.540\n you make this into little tiny chunks,\n\n50:45.540 --> 50:47.100\n you give each chunk to a computer,\n\n50:47.100 --> 50:48.420\n so you're given all these chunks,\n\n50:48.420 --> 50:50.160\n you have parallelism like that.\n\n50:50.160 --> 50:53.520\n But most C programs, you write this linear narrative,\n\n50:53.520 --> 50:55.540\n and you have to make it go fast.\n\n50:55.540 --> 50:57.680\n To make it go fast, you predict all the branches,\n\n50:57.680 --> 50:59.300\n all the data fetches, and you run that.\n\n50:59.300 --> 51:01.920\n More parallel, but that's found parallelism.\n\n51:04.260 --> 51:08.420\n AI is, I'm still trying to decide how fundamental this is.\n\n51:08.420 --> 51:10.900\n It's a given parallelism problem.\n\n51:10.900 --> 51:14.800\n But the way people describe the neural networks,\n\n51:14.800 --> 51:17.900\n and then how they write them in PyTorch, it makes graphs.\n\n51:17.900 --> 51:19.980\n Yeah, that might be fundamentally different\n\n51:19.980 --> 51:21.660\n than the GPU kind of.\n\n51:21.660 --> 51:23.280\n Parallelism, yeah, it might be.\n\n51:23.280 --> 51:27.300\n Because when you run the GPU program on all the pixels,\n\n51:27.300 --> 51:29.860\n you're running, you know, it depends,\n\n51:29.860 --> 51:32.540\n this group of pixels say it's background blue,\n\n51:32.540 --> 51:34.020\n and it runs a really simple program.\n\n51:34.020 --> 51:36.900\n This pixel is, you know, some patch of your face,\n\n51:36.900 --> 51:39.520\n so you have some really interesting shader program\n\n51:39.520 --> 51:41.740\n to give you the impression of translucency.\n\n51:41.740 --> 51:43.940\n But the pixels themselves don't talk to each other.\n\n51:43.940 --> 51:46.620\n There's no graph, right?\n\n51:46.620 --> 51:49.540\n So you do the image, and then you do the next image,\n\n51:49.540 --> 51:51.300\n and you do the next image,\n\n51:51.300 --> 51:53.860\n and you run eight million pixels,\n\n51:53.860 --> 51:55.620\n eight million programs every time,\n\n51:55.620 --> 51:59.580\n and modern GPUs have like 6,000 thread engines in them.\n\n51:59.580 --> 52:02.100\n So, you know, to get eight million pixels,\n\n52:02.100 --> 52:06.140\n each one runs a program on, you know, 10 or 20 pixels.\n\n52:06.140 --> 52:09.380\n And that's how they work, but there's no graph.\n\n52:09.380 --> 52:13.680\n But you think graph might be a totally new way\n\n52:13.680 --> 52:14.900\n to think about hardware.\n\n52:14.900 --> 52:18.140\n So Rajagat Dori and I have been having this conversation\n\n52:18.140 --> 52:20.580\n about given versus found parallelism.\n\n52:20.580 --> 52:22.540\n And then the kind of walk,\n\n52:22.540 --> 52:23.860\n because we got more transistors,\n\n52:23.860 --> 52:25.660\n like, you know, computers way back when\n\n52:25.660 --> 52:27.820\n did stuff on scalar data.\n\n52:27.820 --> 52:30.740\n Now we did it on vector data, famous vector machines.\n\n52:30.740 --> 52:34.500\n Now we're making computers that operate on matrices, right?\n\n52:34.500 --> 52:38.900\n And then the category we said that was next was spatial.\n\n52:38.900 --> 52:40.580\n Like, imagine you have so much data\n\n52:40.580 --> 52:43.420\n that, you know, you want to do the compute on this data,\n\n52:43.420 --> 52:45.920\n and then when it's done, it says,\n\n52:45.920 --> 52:49.260\n send the result to this pile of data on some software on that.\n\n52:49.260 --> 52:53.060\n And it's better to think about it spatially\n\n52:53.060 --> 52:56.140\n than to move all the data to a central processor\n\n52:56.140 --> 52:57.580\n and do all the work.\n\n52:57.580 --> 53:00.740\n So spatially, you mean moving in the space of data\n\n53:00.740 --> 53:02.460\n as opposed to moving the data.\n\n53:02.460 --> 53:05.340\n Yeah, you have a petabyte data space\n\n53:05.340 --> 53:08.620\n spread across some huge array of computers.\n\n53:08.620 --> 53:10.560\n And when you do a computation somewhere,\n\n53:10.560 --> 53:12.300\n you send the result of that computation\n\n53:12.300 --> 53:14.380\n or maybe a pointer to the next program\n\n53:14.380 --> 53:16.660\n to some other piece of data and do it.\n\n53:16.660 --> 53:18.800\n But I think a better word might be graph.\n\n53:18.800 --> 53:21.700\n And all the AI neural networks are graphs.\n\n53:21.700 --> 53:24.060\n Do some computations, send the result here,\n\n53:24.060 --> 53:26.420\n do another computation, do a data transformation,\n\n53:26.420 --> 53:30.340\n do a merging, do a pooling, do another computation.\n\n53:30.340 --> 53:32.280\n Is it possible to compress and say\n\n53:32.280 --> 53:34.580\n how we make this thing efficient,\n\n53:34.580 --> 53:37.300\n this whole process efficient, this different?\n\n53:37.300 --> 53:40.920\n So first, the fundamental elements in the graphs\n\n53:40.920 --> 53:43.220\n are things like matrix multiplies, convolutions,\n\n53:43.220 --> 53:46.140\n data manipulations, and data movements.\n\n53:46.140 --> 53:49.660\n So GPUs emulate those things with their little singles,\n\n53:49.660 --> 53:53.100\n you know, basically running a single threaded program.\n\n53:53.100 --> 53:55.580\n And then there's, you know, and NVIDIA calls it a warp\n\n53:55.580 --> 53:56.900\n where they group a bunch of programs\n\n53:56.900 --> 53:58.420\n that are similar together.\n\n53:58.420 --> 54:01.580\n So for efficiency and instruction use.\n\n54:01.580 --> 54:04.020\n And then at a higher level, you kind of,\n\n54:04.020 --> 54:06.100\n you take this graph and you say this part of the graph\n\n54:06.100 --> 54:09.860\n is a matrix multiplier, which runs on these 32 threads.\n\n54:09.860 --> 54:12.660\n But the model at the bottom was built\n\n54:12.660 --> 54:17.180\n for running programs on pixels, not executing graphs.\n\n54:17.180 --> 54:19.440\n So it's emulation, ultimately.\n\n54:19.440 --> 54:21.120\n So is it possible to build something\n\n54:21.120 --> 54:23.060\n that natively runs graphs?\n\n54:23.060 --> 54:24.980\n Yes, so that's what 10storrent did.\n\n54:26.260 --> 54:27.100\n So.\n\n54:27.100 --> 54:28.220\n Where are we on that?\n\n54:28.220 --> 54:30.920\n How, like, in the history of that effort,\n\n54:30.920 --> 54:32.100\n are we in the early days?\n\n54:32.100 --> 54:33.420\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n54:33.420 --> 54:35.740\n 10storrent started by a friend of mine,\n\n54:35.740 --> 54:39.020\n Labisha Bajek, and I was his first investor.\n\n54:39.020 --> 54:41.660\n So I've been, you know, kind of following him\n\n54:41.660 --> 54:43.740\n and talking to him about it for years.\n\n54:43.740 --> 54:47.000\n And in the fall when I was considering things to do,\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:51.620\n I decided, you know, we held a conference last year\n\n54:51.620 --> 54:53.020\n with a friend, organized it,\n\n54:53.020 --> 54:56.180\n and we wanted to bring in thinkers.\n\n54:56.180 --> 55:00.520\n And two of the people were Andre Carpassi and Chris Ladner.\n\n55:00.520 --> 55:03.440\n And Andre gave this talk, it's on YouTube,\n\n55:03.440 --> 55:06.860\n called Software 2.0, which I think is great.\n\n55:06.860 --> 55:10.200\n Which is, we went from programmed computers,\n\n55:10.200 --> 55:13.820\n where you write programs, to data program computers.\n\n55:13.820 --> 55:18.180\n You know, like the future of software is data programs,\n\n55:18.180 --> 55:19.380\n the networks.\n\n55:19.380 --> 55:21.380\n And I think that's true.\n\n55:21.380 --> 55:23.980\n And then Chris has been working,\n\n55:23.980 --> 55:26.620\n he worked on LLVM, the low level virtual machine,\n\n55:26.620 --> 55:29.100\n which became the intermediate representation\n\n55:29.100 --> 55:31.380\n for all compilers.\n\n55:31.380 --> 55:33.660\n And now he's working on another project called MLIR,\n\n55:33.660 --> 55:36.460\n which is mid level intermediate representation,\n\n55:36.460 --> 55:39.860\n which is essentially under the graph\n\n55:39.860 --> 55:42.820\n about how do you represent that kind of computation\n\n55:42.820 --> 55:44.360\n and then coordinate large numbers\n\n55:44.360 --> 55:46.680\n of potentially heterogeneous computers.\n\n55:47.880 --> 55:50.640\n And I would say technically, Tens Torrents,\n\n55:51.500 --> 55:54.900\n you know, two pillars of those two ideas,\n\n55:54.900 --> 55:58.300\n software 2.0 and mid level representation.\n\n55:58.300 --> 56:01.900\n But it's in service of executing graph programs.\n\n56:01.900 --> 56:03.820\n The hardware is designed to do that.\n\n56:03.820 --> 56:05.580\n So it's including the hardware piece.\n\n56:05.580 --> 56:06.480\n Yeah.\n\n56:06.480 --> 56:08.500\n And then the other cool thing is,\n\n56:08.500 --> 56:10.100\n for a relatively small amount of money,\n\n56:10.100 --> 56:13.340\n they did a test chip and two production chips.\n\n56:13.340 --> 56:15.380\n So it's like a super effective team.\n\n56:15.380 --> 56:18.180\n And unlike some AI startups,\n\n56:18.180 --> 56:20.180\n where if you don't build the hardware\n\n56:20.180 --> 56:22.900\n to run the software that they really want to do,\n\n56:22.900 --> 56:26.060\n then you have to fix it by writing lots more software.\n\n56:26.060 --> 56:29.100\n So the hardware naturally does matrix multiply,\n\n56:29.100 --> 56:31.820\n convolution, the data manipulations,\n\n56:31.820 --> 56:35.340\n and the data movement between processing elements\n\n56:35.340 --> 56:37.600\n that you can see in the graph,\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:40.340\n which I think is all pretty clever.\n\n56:40.340 --> 56:45.060\n And that's what I'm working on now.\n\n56:45.060 --> 56:49.660\n So the, I think it's called the Grace Call Processor.\n\n56:49.660 --> 56:51.260\n I introduced last year.\n\n56:51.260 --> 56:53.780\n It's, you know, there's a bunch of measures of performance.\n\n56:53.780 --> 56:55.480\n We're talking about horses.\n\n56:55.480 --> 56:59.820\n It seems to outperform 368 trillion operations per second.\n\n56:59.820 --> 57:03.180\n It seems to outperform NVIDIA's Tesla T4 system.\n\n57:03.180 --> 57:04.620\n So these are just numbers.\n\n57:04.620 --> 57:07.540\n What do they actually mean in real world performance?\n\n57:07.540 --> 57:10.140\n Like what are the metrics for you\n\n57:10.140 --> 57:12.380\n that you're chasing in your horse race?\n\n57:12.380 --> 57:13.820\n Like what do you care about?\n\n57:13.820 --> 57:17.700\n Well, first, so the native language of,\n\n57:17.700 --> 57:20.340\n you know, people who write AI network programs\n\n57:20.340 --> 57:22.500\n is PyTorch now, PyTorch, TensorFlow.\n\n57:22.500 --> 57:24.020\n There's a couple others.\n\n57:24.020 --> 57:25.820\n Do you think PyTorch is one over TensorFlow?\n\n57:25.820 --> 57:26.640\n Or is it just?\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:27.980\n I'm not an expert on that.\n\n57:27.980 --> 57:29.780\n I know many people who have switched\n\n57:29.780 --> 57:31.660\n from TensorFlow to PyTorch.\n\n57:31.660 --> 57:33.820\n And there's technical reasons for it.\n\n57:33.820 --> 57:34.740\n I use both.\n\n57:34.740 --> 57:35.900\n Both are still awesome.\n\n57:35.900 --> 57:37.160\n Both are still awesome.\n\n57:37.160 --> 57:39.860\n But the deepest love is for PyTorch currently.\n\n57:39.860 --> 57:41.360\n Yeah, there's more love for that.\n\n57:41.360 --> 57:42.620\n And that may change.\n\n57:42.620 --> 57:46.680\n So the first thing is when they write their programs,\n\n57:46.680 --> 57:50.460\n can the hardware execute it pretty much as it was written?\n\n57:50.460 --> 57:53.340\n Right, so PyTorch turns into a graph.\n\n57:53.340 --> 57:55.580\n We have a graph compiler that makes that graph.\n\n57:55.580 --> 57:57.480\n Then it fractions the graph down.\n\n57:57.480 --> 57:58.820\n So if you have big matrix multiply,\n\n57:58.820 --> 58:00.140\n we turn it into right size chunks\n\n58:00.140 --> 58:02.180\n to run on the processing elements.\n\n58:02.180 --> 58:03.300\n It hooks all the graph up.\n\n58:03.300 --> 58:05.140\n It lays out all the data.\n\n58:05.140 --> 58:08.020\n There's a couple of mid level representations of it\n\n58:08.020 --> 58:09.420\n that are also simulatable.\n\n58:09.420 --> 58:12.140\n So that if you're writing the code,\n\n58:12.140 --> 58:15.100\n you can see how it's gonna go through the machine,\n\n58:15.100 --> 58:15.940\n which is pretty cool.\n\n58:15.940 --> 58:17.700\n And then at the bottom, it schedules kernels,\n\n58:17.700 --> 58:21.780\n like math, data manipulation, data movement kernels,\n\n58:21.780 --> 58:22.860\n which do this stuff.\n\n58:22.860 --> 58:26.180\n So we don't have to write a little program\n\n58:26.180 --> 58:27.300\n to do matrix multiply,\n\n58:27.300 --> 58:29.140\n because we have a big matrix multiplier.\n\n58:29.140 --> 58:31.240\n There's no SIMD program for that.\n\n58:31.240 --> 58:36.000\n But there is scheduling for that, right?\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:37.640\n So one of the goals is,\n\n58:37.640 --> 58:40.200\n if you write a piece of PyTorch code\n\n58:40.200 --> 58:41.240\n that looks pretty reasonable,\n\n58:41.240 --> 58:43.480\n you should be able to compile it, run it on the hardware\n\n58:43.480 --> 58:44.760\n without having to tweak it\n\n58:44.760 --> 58:48.100\n and do all kinds of crazy things to get performance.\n\n58:48.100 --> 58:50.120\n There's not a lot of intermediate steps.\n\n58:50.120 --> 58:51.320\n It's running directly as written.\n\n58:51.320 --> 58:54.640\n Like on a GPU, if you write a large matrix multiply naively,\n\n58:54.640 --> 58:57.680\n you'll get five to 10% of the peak performance of the GPU.\n\n58:58.680 --> 59:00.520\n Right, and then there's a bunch of people\n\n59:00.520 --> 59:01.600\n who've published papers on this,\n\n59:01.600 --> 59:04.080\n and I read them about what steps do you have to do.\n\n59:04.080 --> 59:06.760\n And it goes from pretty reasonable,\n\n59:06.760 --> 59:08.480\n well, transpose one of the matrices.\n\n59:08.480 --> 59:10.560\n So you do row ordered, not column ordered,\n\n59:11.680 --> 59:14.520\n block it so that you can put a block of the matrix\n\n59:14.520 --> 59:17.740\n on different SMs, groups of threads.\n\n59:19.340 --> 59:21.160\n But some of it gets into little details,\n\n59:21.160 --> 59:23.000\n like you have to schedule it just so,\n\n59:23.000 --> 59:25.040\n so you don't have register conflicts.\n\n59:25.040 --> 59:28.240\n So they call them CUDA ninjas.\n\n59:28.240 --> 59:31.080\n CUDA ninjas, I love it.\n\n59:31.080 --> 59:32.320\n To get to the optimal point,\n\n59:32.320 --> 59:36.080\n you either use a prewritten library,\n\n59:36.080 --> 59:37.880\n which is a good strategy for some things,\n\n59:37.880 --> 59:39.600\n or you have to be an expert\n\n59:39.600 --> 59:42.200\n in micro architecture to program it.\n\n59:42.200 --> 59:43.480\n Right, so the optimization step\n\n59:43.480 --> 59:44.960\n is way more complicated with the GPU.\n\n59:44.960 --> 59:47.880\n So our goal is if you write PyTorch,\n\n59:47.880 --> 59:49.560\n that's good PyTorch, you can do it.\n\n59:49.560 --> 59:53.080\n Now there's, as the networks are evolving,\n\n59:53.080 --> 59:56.440\n they've changed from convolutional to matrix multiply.\n\n59:56.440 --> 59:58.040\n People are talking about conditional graphs,\n\n59:58.040 --> 59:59.800\n they're talking about very large matrices,\n\n59:59.800 --> 1:00:01.680\n they're talking about sparsity,\n\n1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:03.360\n they're talking about problems\n\n1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:06.120\n that scale across many, many chips.\n\n1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:11.120\n So the native data item is a packet.\n\n1:00:11.720 --> 1:00:14.560\n So you send a packet to a processor, it gets processed,\n\n1:00:14.560 --> 1:00:15.400\n it does a bunch of work,\n\n1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:17.640\n and then it may send packets to other processors,\n\n1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:20.520\n and they execute in like a data flow graph\n\n1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:22.080\n kind of methodology.\n\n1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:22.920\n Got it.\n\n1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:24.400\n We have a big network on chip,\n\n1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:27.760\n and then the second chip has 16 ethernet ports\n\n1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:29.560\n to hook lots of them together,\n\n1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:32.400\n and it's the same graph compiler across multiple chips.\n\n1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:33.600\n So that's where the scale comes in.\n\n1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:35.120\n So it's built to scale naturally.\n\n1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:38.180\n Now, my experience with scaling is as you scale,\n\n1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.760\n you run into lots of interesting problems.\n\n1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:43.200\n So scaling is the mountain to climb.\n\n1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:44.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:44.980\n So the hardware is built to do this,\n\n1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:47.700\n and then we're in the process of.\n\n1:00:47.700 --> 1:00:49.160\n Is there a software part to this\n\n1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:51.640\n with ethernet and all that?\n\n1:00:51.640 --> 1:00:54.760\n Well, the protocol at the bottom,\n\n1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:57.640\n we sent, it's an ethernet PHY,\n\n1:00:57.640 --> 1:00:59.760\n but the protocol basically says,\n\n1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:01.440\n send the packet from here to there.\n\n1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:03.120\n It's all point to point.\n\n1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:05.840\n The header bit says which processor to send it to,\n\n1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:09.560\n and we basically take a packet off our on chip network,\n\n1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:11.200\n put an ethernet header on it,\n\n1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:13.920\n send it to the other end to strip the header off,\n\n1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:14.880\n and send it to the local thing.\n\n1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:16.120\n It's pretty straightforward.\n\n1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:18.160\n Human to human interaction is pretty straightforward too,\n\n1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:19.360\n but when you get a million of us,\n\n1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:21.440\n we could do some crazy stuff together.\n\n1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:23.380\n Yeah, it's gonna be fun.\n\n1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:25.860\n So is that the goal is scale?\n\n1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:28.360\n So like, for example, I've been recently\n\n1:01:28.360 --> 1:01:30.100\n doing a bunch of robots at home\n\n1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:32.360\n for my own personal pleasure.\n\n1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:35.780\n Am I going to ever use 10th Story, or is this more for?\n\n1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:37.200\n There's all kinds of problems.\n\n1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:38.720\n Like, there's small inference problems,\n\n1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:41.440\n or small training problems, or big training problems.\n\n1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:42.680\n What's the big goal?\n\n1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:45.080\n Is it the big training problems,\n\n1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:46.320\n or the small training problems?\n\n1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:48.060\n Well, one of the goals is to scale\n\n1:01:48.060 --> 1:01:51.720\n from 100 milliwatts to a megawatt, you know?\n\n1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:54.840\n So like, really have some range on the problems,\n\n1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:57.120\n and the same kind of AI programs\n\n1:01:57.120 --> 1:01:59.320\n work at all different levels.\n\n1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.600\n So that's the goal.\n\n1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:02.960\n The natural, since the natural data item\n\n1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.320\n is a packet that we can move around,\n\n1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:10.320\n it's built to scale, but so many people have small problems.\n\n1:02:11.560 --> 1:02:12.400\n Right, right.\n\n1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:13.240\n But the, you know.\n\n1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:16.400\n Like, inside that phone is a small problem to solve.\n\n1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:19.960\n So do you see 10th Story potentially being inside a phone?\n\n1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:22.600\n Well, the power efficiency of local memory,\n\n1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:26.360\n local computation, and the way we built it is pretty good.\n\n1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:28.520\n And then there's a lot of efficiency\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.500\n on being able to do conditional graphs and sparsity.\n\n1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:34.540\n I think it's, for complicated networks\n\n1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:38.180\n that wanna go in a small factor, it's gonna be quite good.\n\n1:02:38.180 --> 1:02:40.200\n But we have to prove that, that's all.\n\n1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:41.040\n It's a fun problem.\n\n1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:42.280\n And that's the early days of the company, right?\n\n1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:44.600\n It's a couple years, you said?\n\n1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:47.560\n But you think, you invested, you think they're legit.\n\n1:02:47.560 --> 1:02:48.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:49.220\n And so you joined.\n\n1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:50.060\n Yeah, I joined.\n\n1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:50.900\n Well, that's.\n\n1:02:50.900 --> 1:02:53.240\n That's a really interesting place to be.\n\n1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.720\n Like, the AI world is exploding, you know.\n\n1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:58.520\n And I looked at some other opportunities\n\n1:02:58.520 --> 1:03:01.520\n like build a faster processor, which people want.\n\n1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:03.760\n But that's more on an incremental path\n\n1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:07.860\n than what's gonna happen in AI in the next 10 years.\n\n1:03:07.860 --> 1:03:08.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:10.080\n So this is kind of, you know,\n\n1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:12.240\n an exciting place to be part of.\n\n1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:14.080\n Yeah, the revolutions will be happening\n\n1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:15.280\n in the very space that Tesla is.\n\n1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:16.680\n And then lots of people are working on it,\n\n1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:18.900\n but there's lots of technical reasons why some of them,\n\n1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:20.320\n you know, aren't gonna work out that well.\n\n1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:23.640\n And, you know, that's interesting.\n\n1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.860\n And there's also the same problem\n\n1:03:25.860 --> 1:03:27.540\n about getting the basics right.\n\n1:03:27.540 --> 1:03:30.000\n Like, we've talked to customers about exciting features.\n\n1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.080\n And at some point we realized that,\n\n1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:34.720\n Labish and I were realizing they want to hear first\n\n1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:36.700\n about memory bandwidth, local bandwidth,\n\n1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:39.240\n compute intensity, programmability.\n\n1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:42.000\n They want to know the basics, power management,\n\n1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.140\n how the network ports work, what are the basics,\n\n1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:46.120\n do all the basics work.\n\n1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:48.000\n Because it's easy to say, we've got this great idea,\n\n1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000\n you know, the crack GPT3, but the people we talked to\n\n1:03:53.260 --> 1:03:57.520\n want to say, if I buy the, so we have a PCI Express card\n\n1:03:57.520 --> 1:03:59.680\n with our chip on it, if you buy the card,\n\n1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.960\n you plug it in your machine to download the driver,\n\n1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.080\n how long does it take me to get my network to run?\n\n1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:05.920\n Right, right.\n\n1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:06.760\n You know, that's a real question.\n\n1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:08.360\n It's a very basic question.\n\n1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:09.360\n So, yeah.\n\n1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:10.520\n Is there an answer to that yet,\n\n1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:11.360\n or is it trying to get to that?\n\n1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:13.400\n Our goal is like an hour.\n\n1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:14.240\n Okay.\n\n1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:15.520\n When can I buy a Tesla?\n\n1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:17.640\n Pretty soon.\n\n1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:19.640\n Or my, for the small case training.\n\n1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:21.120\n Yeah, pretty soon.\n\n1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:21.960\n Months.\n\n1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:22.800\n Good.\n\n1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:24.740\n I love the idea of you inside the room\n\n1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:29.180\n with the Carpathi, Andre Carpathi and Chris Ladner.\n\n1:04:31.440 --> 1:04:35.980\n Very, very interesting, very brilliant people,\n\n1:04:35.980 --> 1:04:37.560\n very out of the box thinkers,\n\n1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:39.960\n but also like first principles thinkers.\n\n1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:42.640\n Well, they both get stuff done.\n\n1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.920\n They only get stuff done to get their own projects done.\n\n1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.000\n They talk about it clearly.\n\n1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.720\n They educate large numbers of people,\n\n1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:50.520\n and they've created platforms for other people\n\n1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:52.000\n to go do their stuff on.\n\n1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.520\n Yeah, the clear thinking that's able to be communicated\n\n1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:57.200\n is kind of impressive.\n\n1:04:57.200 --> 1:05:00.760\n It's kind of remarkable to, yeah, I'm a fan.\n\n1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:02.000\n Well, let me ask,\n\n1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000\n because I talk to Chris actually a lot these days.\n\n1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.880\n He's been one of the, just to give him a shout out,\n\n1:05:08.880 --> 1:05:13.700\n he's been so supportive as a human being.\n\n1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:16.280\n So everybody's quite different.\n\n1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:17.640\n Like great engineers are different,\n\n1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:20.760\n but he's been like sensitive to the human element\n\n1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.240\n in a way that's been fascinating.\n\n1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:23.960\n Like he was one of the early people\n\n1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:27.880\n on this stupid podcast that I do to say like,\n\n1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:29.640\n don't quit this thing,\n\n1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:34.120\n and also talk to whoever the hell you want to talk to.\n\n1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:38.040\n That kind of from a legit engineer to get like props\n\n1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:39.960\n and be like, you can do this.\n\n1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:42.240\n That was, I mean, that's what a good leader does, right?\n\n1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:45.100\n To just kind of let a little kid do his thing,\n\n1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:48.700\n like go do it, let's see what turns out.\n\n1:05:48.700 --> 1:05:50.500\n That's a pretty powerful thing.\n\n1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:54.440\n But what do you, what's your sense about,\n\n1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:57.660\n he used to be, no, I think stepped away from Google, right?\n\n1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:00.980\n He's at SciFive, I think.\n\n1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:03.820\n What's really impressive to you\n\n1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:05.720\n about the things that Chris has worked on?\n\n1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:08.300\n Because we mentioned the optimization,\n\n1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:10.840\n the compiler design stuff, the LLVM,\n\n1:06:10.840 --> 1:06:15.200\n then there's, he's also at Google worked at the TPU stuff.\n\n1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:19.360\n He's obviously worked on Swift,\n\n1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:21.360\n so the programming language side.\n\n1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.280\n Talking about people that work in the entirety of the stack.\n\n1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:27.920\n What, from your time interacting with Chris\n\n1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:30.760\n and knowing the guy, what's really impressive to you\n\n1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:32.120\n that just inspires you?\n\n1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:37.120\n Well, like LLVM became the defacto platform\n\n1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:42.120\n for the defacto platform for compilers.\n\n1:06:42.180 --> 1:06:43.840\n It's amazing.\n\n1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:46.380\n And it was good code quality, good design choices.\n\n1:06:46.380 --> 1:06:48.860\n He hit the right level of abstraction.\n\n1:06:48.860 --> 1:06:52.060\n There's a little bit of the right time, the right place.\n\n1:06:52.060 --> 1:06:55.460\n And then he built a new programming language called Swift,\n\n1:06:55.460 --> 1:06:59.100\n which after, let's say some adoption resistance\n\n1:06:59.100 --> 1:07:01.180\n became very successful.\n\n1:07:01.180 --> 1:07:03.380\n I don't know that much about his work at Google,\n\n1:07:03.380 --> 1:07:07.140\n although I know that that was a typical,\n\n1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:11.580\n they started TensorFlow stuff and it was new.\n\n1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:13.620\n They wrote a lot of code and then at some point\n\n1:07:13.620 --> 1:07:16.140\n it needed to be refactored to be,\n\n1:07:17.220 --> 1:07:19.100\n because its development slowed down,\n\n1:07:19.100 --> 1:07:22.340\n why PyTorch started a little later and then passed it.\n\n1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:23.940\n So he did a lot of work on that.\n\n1:07:23.940 --> 1:07:25.980\n And then his idea about MLIR,\n\n1:07:25.980 --> 1:07:28.260\n which is what people started to realize\n\n1:07:28.260 --> 1:07:30.580\n is the complexity of the software stack above\n\n1:07:30.580 --> 1:07:33.540\n the low level IR was getting so high\n\n1:07:33.540 --> 1:07:36.580\n that forcing the features of that into the level\n\n1:07:36.580 --> 1:07:38.740\n was putting too much of a burden on it.\n\n1:07:38.740 --> 1:07:41.580\n So he's splitting that into multiple pieces.\n\n1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:43.820\n And that was one of the inspirations for our software stack\n\n1:07:43.820 --> 1:07:46.700\n where we have several intermediate representations\n\n1:07:46.700 --> 1:07:49.700\n that are all executable and you can look at them\n\n1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:53.940\n and do transformations on them before you lower the level.\n\n1:07:53.940 --> 1:07:58.160\n So that was, I think we started before MLIR\n\n1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:01.700\n really got far enough along to use,\n\n1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:02.820\n but we're interested in that.\n\n1:08:02.820 --> 1:08:04.660\n He's really excited about MLIR.\n\n1:08:04.660 --> 1:08:06.660\n That's his like little baby.\n\n1:08:06.660 --> 1:08:10.900\n So he, and there seems to be some profound ideas on that\n\n1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:11.820\n that are really useful.\n\n1:08:11.820 --> 1:08:14.960\n So each one of those things has been,\n\n1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.780\n as the world of software gets more and more complicated,\n\n1:08:17.780 --> 1:08:20.060\n how do we create the right abstraction levels\n\n1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:23.340\n to simplify it in a way that people can now work independently\n\n1:08:23.340 --> 1:08:25.140\n on different levels of it?\n\n1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:27.200\n So I would say all three of those projects,\n\n1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:31.620\n LLVM, Swift, and MLIR did that successfully.\n\n1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:33.700\n So I'm interested in what he's gonna do next\n\n1:08:33.700 --> 1:08:34.820\n in the same kind of way.\n\n1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:36.220\n Yes.\n\n1:08:36.220 --> 1:08:40.680\n On either the TPU or maybe the Nvidia GPU side,\n\n1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:45.860\n how does 10th Story think, or the ideas underlying it,\n\n1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:47.020\n does it have to be 10th Story?\n\n1:08:47.020 --> 1:08:49.900\n Just this kind of graph focused,\n\n1:08:51.580 --> 1:08:56.580\n graph centric hardware, deep learning centric hardware,\n\n1:08:56.580 --> 1:09:00.180\n beat NVIDIAs, do you think it's possible\n\n1:09:00.180 --> 1:09:02.280\n for it to basically overtake NVIDIA?\n\n1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:03.500\n Sure.\n\n1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:05.600\n What's that process look like?\n\n1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:08.060\n What's that journey look like, you think?\n\n1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:11.060\n Well, GPUs were built to run shader programs\n\n1:09:11.060 --> 1:09:13.860\n on millions of pixels, not to run graphs.\n\n1:09:13.860 --> 1:09:14.700\n Yes.\n\n1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:17.380\n So there's a hypothesis that says\n\n1:09:17.380 --> 1:09:20.300\n the way the graphs are built\n\n1:09:20.300 --> 1:09:21.540\n is going to be really interesting\n\n1:09:21.540 --> 1:09:24.080\n to be inefficient on computing this.\n\n1:09:24.080 --> 1:09:27.520\n And then the primitives is not a SIMD program,\n\n1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:30.080\n it's matrix multiply convolution.\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:33.780\n And then the data manipulations are fairly extensive about,\n\n1:09:33.780 --> 1:09:36.380\n like, how do you do a fast transpose with a program?\n\n1:09:36.380 --> 1:09:38.780\n I don't know if you've ever written a transpose program.\n\n1:09:38.780 --> 1:09:40.420\n They're ugly and slow, but in hardware,\n\n1:09:40.420 --> 1:09:42.140\n you can do really well.\n\n1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:43.300\n Like, I'll give you an example.\n\n1:09:43.300 --> 1:09:47.800\n So when GPU accelerators first started doing triangles,\n\n1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.020\n like, so you have a triangle\n\n1:09:49.020 --> 1:09:51.180\n which maps on a set of pixels.\n\n1:09:51.180 --> 1:09:52.580\n So you build, it's very easy,\n\n1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:54.220\n straightforward to build a hardware engine\n\n1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:55.860\n that'll find all those pixels.\n\n1:09:55.860 --> 1:09:56.700\n And it's kind of weird\n\n1:09:56.700 --> 1:09:59.260\n because you walk along the triangle to get to the edge,\n\n1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:01.300\n and then you have to go back down to the next row\n\n1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:04.080\n and walk along, and then you have to decide on the edge\n\n1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:08.060\n if the line of the triangle is like half on the pixel,\n\n1:10:08.060 --> 1:10:09.140\n what's the pixel color?\n\n1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:11.100\n Because it's half of this pixel and half the next one.\n\n1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:12.980\n That's called rasterization.\n\n1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:15.900\n And you're saying that could be done in hardware?\n\n1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:19.340\n No, that's an example of that operation\n\n1:10:19.340 --> 1:10:22.100\n as a software program is really bad.\n\n1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:24.420\n I've written a program that did rasterization.\n\n1:10:24.420 --> 1:10:26.860\n The hardware that does it has actually less code\n\n1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:28.980\n than the software program that does it,\n\n1:10:28.980 --> 1:10:30.340\n and it's way faster.\n\n1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:33.440\n Right, so there are certain times\n\n1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:37.780\n when the abstraction you have, rasterize a triangle,\n\n1:10:37.780 --> 1:10:41.300\n you know, execute a graph, you know, components of a graph.\n\n1:10:41.300 --> 1:10:43.860\n But the right thing to do in the hardware software boundary\n\n1:10:43.860 --> 1:10:45.780\n is for the hardware to naturally do it.\n\n1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:47.940\n And so the GPU is really optimized\n\n1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:50.100\n for the rasterization of triangles.\n\n1:10:50.100 --> 1:10:52.860\n Well, you know, that's just, well, like in a modern,\n\n1:10:52.860 --> 1:10:56.980\n you know, that's a small piece of modern GPUs.\n\n1:10:56.980 --> 1:10:59.940\n What they did is that they still rasterize triangles\n\n1:10:59.940 --> 1:11:02.460\n when you're running in a game, but for the most part,\n\n1:11:02.460 --> 1:11:04.420\n most of the computation in the area of the GPU\n\n1:11:04.420 --> 1:11:05.900\n is running shader programs.\n\n1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:09.580\n But they're single threaded programs on pixels, not graphs.\n\n1:11:09.580 --> 1:11:11.820\n I have to be honest, I'd say I don't actually know\n\n1:11:11.820 --> 1:11:15.060\n the math behind shader, shading and lighting\n\n1:11:15.060 --> 1:11:16.180\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:11:16.180 --> 1:11:17.780\n I don't know what.\n\n1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:20.100\n They look like little simple floating point programs\n\n1:11:20.100 --> 1:11:21.220\n or complicated ones.\n\n1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:23.740\n You can have 8,000 instructions in a shader program.\n\n1:11:23.740 --> 1:11:25.580\n But I don't have a good intuition\n\n1:11:25.580 --> 1:11:27.980\n why it could be parallelized so easily.\n\n1:11:27.980 --> 1:11:30.660\n No, it's because you have 8 million pixels in every single.\n\n1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:34.660\n So when you have a light, right, that comes down,\n\n1:11:34.660 --> 1:11:36.780\n the angle, you know, the amount of light,\n\n1:11:36.780 --> 1:11:40.740\n like say this is a line of pixels across this table, right?\n\n1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:43.620\n The amount of light on each pixel is subtly different.\n\n1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:45.980\n And each pixel is responsible for figuring out what.\n\n1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:46.820\n Figuring it out.\n\n1:11:46.820 --> 1:11:48.580\n So that pixel says, I'm this pixel.\n\n1:11:48.580 --> 1:11:49.940\n I know the angle of the light.\n\n1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:50.900\n I know the occlusion.\n\n1:11:50.900 --> 1:11:52.420\n I know the color I am.\n\n1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:54.420\n Like every single pixel here is a different color.\n\n1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:57.160\n Every single pixel gets a different amount of light.\n\n1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:00.580\n Every single pixel has a subtly different translucency.\n\n1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:02.140\n So to make it look realistic,\n\n1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:05.140\n the solution was you run a separate program on every pixel.\n\n1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:06.720\n See, but I thought there's like reflection\n\n1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:08.060\n from all over the place.\n\n1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:09.620\n Every pixel. Yeah, but there is.\n\n1:12:09.620 --> 1:12:11.060\n So you build a reflection map,\n\n1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:14.180\n which also has some pixelated thing.\n\n1:12:14.180 --> 1:12:16.340\n And then when the pixel is looking at the reflection map,\n\n1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:19.220\n it has to calculate what the normal of the surface is.\n\n1:12:19.220 --> 1:12:20.900\n And it does it per pixel.\n\n1:12:20.900 --> 1:12:22.780\n By the way, there's boatloads of hacks on that.\n\n1:12:22.780 --> 1:12:25.660\n You know, like you may have a lower resolution light map,\n\n1:12:25.660 --> 1:12:26.660\n your reflection map.\n\n1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:29.220\n There's all these, you know, tax they do.\n\n1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:32.940\n But at the end of the day, it's per pixel computation.\n\n1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:35.540\n And it's so happening that you can map\n\n1:12:35.540 --> 1:12:39.340\n graph like computation onto this pixel central computation.\n\n1:12:39.340 --> 1:12:41.360\n You can do floating point programs\n\n1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.460\n on convolutions and the matrices.\n\n1:12:43.460 --> 1:12:46.220\n And Nvidia invested for years in CUDA.\n\n1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:50.140\n First for HPC, and then they got lucky with the AI trend.\n\n1:12:50.140 --> 1:12:52.300\n But do you think they're going to essentially\n\n1:12:52.300 --> 1:12:55.440\n not be able to hardcore pivot out of their?\n\n1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:56.280\n We'll see.\n\n1:12:57.420 --> 1:12:59.460\n That's always interesting.\n\n1:12:59.460 --> 1:13:01.260\n How often do big companies hardcore pivot?\n\n1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:02.100\n Occasionally.\n\n1:13:03.820 --> 1:13:06.340\n How much do you know about Nvidia, folks?\n\n1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:08.140\n Some. Some?\n\n1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.020\n Well, I'm curious as well.\n\n1:13:10.020 --> 1:13:11.460\n Who's ultimately, as a...\n\n1:13:11.460 --> 1:13:13.380\n Well, they've innovated several times.\n\n1:13:13.380 --> 1:13:15.220\n But they've also worked really hard on mobile.\n\n1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:17.340\n They've worked really hard on radios.\n\n1:13:17.340 --> 1:13:20.680\n You know, they're fundamentally a GPU company.\n\n1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:21.860\n Well, they tried to pivot.\n\n1:13:21.860 --> 1:13:26.160\n There's an interesting little game and play\n\n1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:27.660\n in autonomous vehicles, right?\n\n1:13:27.660 --> 1:13:30.660\n With, or semi autonomous, like playing with Tesla\n\n1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:34.020\n and so on and seeing that's dipping a toe\n\n1:13:34.020 --> 1:13:35.700\n into that kind of pivot.\n\n1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:37.100\n They came out with this platform,\n\n1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:39.140\n which is interesting technically.\n\n1:13:39.140 --> 1:13:42.700\n But it was like a 3000 watt, you know,\n\n1:13:42.700 --> 1:13:46.220\n 3000 watt, $3,000 GPU platform.\n\n1:13:46.220 --> 1:13:47.540\n I don't know if it's interesting technically.\n\n1:13:47.540 --> 1:13:49.920\n It's interesting philosophically.\n\n1:13:49.920 --> 1:13:51.900\n Technically, I don't know if it's the execution\n\n1:13:51.900 --> 1:13:53.440\n of the craftsmanship is there.\n\n1:13:53.440 --> 1:13:54.580\n I'm not sure.\n\n1:13:54.580 --> 1:13:55.420\n But I didn't get a sense.\n\n1:13:55.420 --> 1:13:57.780\n I think they were repurposing GPUs\n\n1:13:57.780 --> 1:13:59.140\n for an automotive solution.\n\n1:13:59.140 --> 1:14:00.340\n Right, it's not a real pivot.\n\n1:14:00.340 --> 1:14:03.140\n They didn't build a ground up solution.\n\n1:14:03.140 --> 1:14:03.980\n Right.\n\n1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:06.360\n Like the chips inside Tesla are pretty cheap.\n\n1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:08.080\n Like Mobileye has been doing this.\n\n1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:10.840\n They're doing the classic work from the simplest thing.\n\n1:14:10.840 --> 1:14:11.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:14.260\n I mean, 40 square millimeter chips.\n\n1:14:14.260 --> 1:14:17.500\n And Nvidia, their solution had 800 millimeter chips\n\n1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:19.180\n and two 200 millimeter chips.\n\n1:14:19.180 --> 1:14:22.540\n And, you know, like boatloads are really expensive DRAMs.\n\n1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:27.020\n And, you know, it's a really different approach.\n\n1:14:27.020 --> 1:14:28.900\n And Mobileye fit the, let's say,\n\n1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:31.300\n automotive cost and form factor.\n\n1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:34.140\n And then they added features as it was economically viable.\n\n1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:36.300\n And Nvidia said, take the biggest thing\n\n1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:38.780\n and we're gonna go make it work.\n\n1:14:38.780 --> 1:14:41.420\n You know, and that's also influenced like Waymo.\n\n1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:43.660\n There's a whole bunch of autonomous startups\n\n1:14:43.660 --> 1:14:46.820\n where they have a 5,000 watt server in their trunk.\n\n1:14:46.820 --> 1:14:47.860\n Right.\n\n1:14:47.860 --> 1:14:50.580\n But that's because they think, well, 5,000 watts\n\n1:14:50.580 --> 1:14:52.300\n and, you know, $10,000 is okay\n\n1:14:52.300 --> 1:14:54.740\n because it's replacing a driver.\n\n1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:58.100\n Elon's approach was that port has to be cheap enough\n\n1:14:58.100 --> 1:14:59.540\n to put it in every single Tesla,\n\n1:14:59.540 --> 1:15:02.300\n whether they turn on autonomous driving or not.\n\n1:15:02.300 --> 1:15:04.740\n Which, and Mobileye was like,\n\n1:15:04.740 --> 1:15:06.820\n we need to fit in the bomb and, you know,\n\n1:15:06.820 --> 1:15:09.460\n cost structure that car companies do.\n\n1:15:09.460 --> 1:15:12.460\n So they may sell you a GPS for 1500 bucks,\n\n1:15:12.460 --> 1:15:15.140\n but the bomb for that, it's like $25.\n\n1:15:16.460 --> 1:15:20.140\n Well, and for Mobileye, it seems like neural networks\n\n1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:22.980\n were not first class citizens, like the computation.\n\n1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:24.660\n They didn't start out as a...\n\n1:15:24.660 --> 1:15:26.100\n Yeah, it was a CV problem.\n\n1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:27.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:27.100 --> 1:15:29.940\n And did classic CV and found stoplights and lines.\n\n1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:31.220\n And they were really good at it.\n\n1:15:31.220 --> 1:15:33.060\n Yeah, and they never, I mean,\n\n1:15:33.060 --> 1:15:34.140\n I don't know what's happening now,\n\n1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:35.820\n but they never fully pivoted.\n\n1:15:35.820 --> 1:15:37.980\n I mean, it's like, it's the Nvidia thing.\n\n1:15:37.980 --> 1:15:39.740\n And then as opposed to,\n\n1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:41.980\n so if you look at the new Tesla work,\n\n1:15:41.980 --> 1:15:45.540\n it's like neural networks from the ground up, right?\n\n1:15:45.540 --> 1:15:48.100\n Yeah, and even Tesla started with a lot of CV stuff in it\n\n1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:50.340\n and Andrei's basically been eliminating it.\n\n1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:54.340\n Move everything into the network.\n\n1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:57.940\n So without, this isn't like confidential stuff,\n\n1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:01.620\n but you sitting on a porch, looking over the world,\n\n1:16:01.620 --> 1:16:03.740\n looking at the work that Andrei's doing,\n\n1:16:03.740 --> 1:16:06.420\n that Elon's doing with Tesla Autopilot,\n\n1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:08.780\n do you like the trajectory of where things are going\n\n1:16:08.780 --> 1:16:09.620\n on the hardware side?\n\n1:16:09.620 --> 1:16:10.900\n Well, they're making serious progress.\n\n1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:14.100\n I like the videos of people driving the beta stuff.\n\n1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:16.500\n I guess taking some pretty complicated intersections\n\n1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.580\n and all that, but it's still an intervention per drive.\n\n1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:23.020\n I mean, I have autopilot, the current autopilot,\n\n1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:24.540\n my Tesla, I use it every day.\n\n1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:26.340\n Do you have full self driving beta or no?\n\n1:16:26.340 --> 1:16:27.180\n No.\n\n1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:28.700\n So you like where this is going?\n\n1:16:28.700 --> 1:16:29.540\n They're making progress.\n\n1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:32.220\n It's taking longer than anybody thought.\n\n1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:37.220\n You know, my wonder is, you know, hardware three,\n\n1:16:37.380 --> 1:16:40.620\n is it enough computing off by two, off by five,\n\n1:16:40.620 --> 1:16:42.380\n off by 10, off by a hundred?\n\n1:16:42.380 --> 1:16:43.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:43.220 --> 1:16:47.180\n And I thought it probably wasn't enough,\n\n1:16:47.180 --> 1:16:49.820\n but they're doing pretty well with it now.\n\n1:16:49.820 --> 1:16:50.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:53.380\n And one thing is the data set gets bigger,\n\n1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:55.060\n the training gets better.\n\n1:16:55.060 --> 1:16:58.420\n And then there's this interesting thing is you sort of train\n\n1:16:58.420 --> 1:17:01.380\n and build an arbitrary size network that solves the problem.\n\n1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:03.720\n And then you refactor the network down to the thing\n\n1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:06.780\n that you can afford to ship, right?\n\n1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:10.740\n So the goal isn't to build a network that fits in the phone.\n\n1:17:10.740 --> 1:17:13.760\n It's to build something that actually works.\n\n1:17:14.860 --> 1:17:17.700\n And then how do you make that most effective\n\n1:17:17.700 --> 1:17:19.860\n on the hardware you have?\n\n1:17:19.860 --> 1:17:21.700\n And they seem to be doing that much better\n\n1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:23.580\n than a couple of years ago.\n\n1:17:23.580 --> 1:17:25.820\n Well, the one really important thing is also\n\n1:17:25.820 --> 1:17:28.700\n what they're doing well is how to iterate that quickly,\n\n1:17:28.700 --> 1:17:31.780\n which means like it's not just about one time deployment,\n\n1:17:31.780 --> 1:17:34.220\n one building, it's constantly iterating the network\n\n1:17:34.220 --> 1:17:37.540\n and trying to automate as many steps as possible, right?\n\n1:17:37.540 --> 1:17:41.700\n And that's actually the principles of the Software 2.0,\n\n1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:46.700\n like you mentioned with Andre is it's not just,\n\n1:17:46.980 --> 1:17:48.300\n I mean, I don't know what the actual,\n\n1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:50.900\n his description of Software 2.0 is.\n\n1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:53.520\n If it's just high level philosophical or their specifics,\n\n1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:57.100\n but the interesting thing about what that actually looks\n\n1:17:57.100 --> 1:18:01.860\n in the real world is it's that what I think Andre calls\n\n1:18:01.860 --> 1:18:05.740\n the data engine, it's like it's the iterative improvement\n\n1:18:05.740 --> 1:18:06.580\n of the thing.\n\n1:18:06.580 --> 1:18:10.500\n You have a neural network that does stuff,\n\n1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:12.740\n fails on a bunch of things and learns from it\n\n1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:13.620\n over and over and over.\n\n1:18:13.620 --> 1:18:15.900\n So you're constantly discovering edge cases.\n\n1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:19.920\n So it's very much about like data engineering,\n\n1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:23.060\n like figuring out, it's kind of what you were talking about\n\n1:18:23.060 --> 1:18:25.740\n with TestTorrent is you have the data landscape.\n\n1:18:25.740 --> 1:18:27.580\n And you have to walk along that data landscape\n\n1:18:27.580 --> 1:18:32.580\n in a way that is constantly improving the neural network.\n\n1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:35.820\n And that feels like that's the central piece of it.\n\n1:18:35.820 --> 1:18:37.140\n And there's two pieces of it.\n\n1:18:37.140 --> 1:18:40.900\n Like you find edge cases that don't work\n\n1:18:40.900 --> 1:18:42.340\n and then you define something that goes,\n\n1:18:42.340 --> 1:18:44.220\n get your data for that.\n\n1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:45.820\n But then the other constraint is whether you have\n\n1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:46.940\n to label it or not.\n\n1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:49.860\n Like the amazing thing about like the GPT3 stuff\n\n1:18:49.860 --> 1:18:51.540\n is it's unsupervised.\n\n1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:53.300\n So there's essentially infinite amount of data.\n\n1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:56.260\n Now there's obviously infinite amount of data available\n\n1:18:56.260 --> 1:18:59.220\n from cars of people successfully driving.\n\n1:18:59.220 --> 1:19:02.060\n But the current pipelines are mostly running\n\n1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:04.660\n on labeled data, which is human limited.\n\n1:19:04.660 --> 1:19:07.540\n So when that becomes unsupervised,\n\n1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.620\n it'll create unlimited amount of data,\n\n1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:14.240\n which then they'll scale.\n\n1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:16.220\n Now the networks that may use that data\n\n1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:18.260\n might be way too big for cars,\n\n1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:20.020\n but then there'll be the transformation from now\n\n1:19:20.020 --> 1:19:22.360\n we have unlimited data, I know exactly what I want.\n\n1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:25.820\n Now can I turn that into something that fits in the car?\n\n1:19:25.820 --> 1:19:29.220\n And that process is gonna happen all over the place.\n\n1:19:29.220 --> 1:19:30.700\n Every time you get to the place where you have\n\n1:19:30.700 --> 1:19:34.100\n unlimited data, and that's what software 2.0 is about,\n\n1:19:34.100 --> 1:19:36.780\n unlimited data training networks to do stuff\n\n1:19:37.980 --> 1:19:40.700\n without humans writing code to do it.\n\n1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:42.980\n And ultimately also trying to discover,\n\n1:19:42.980 --> 1:19:46.540\n like you're saying, the self supervised formulation\n\n1:19:46.540 --> 1:19:47.380\n of the problem.\n\n1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:49.660\n So the unsupervised formulation of the problem.\n\n1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:53.540\n Like in driving, there's this really interesting thing,\n\n1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:58.140\n which is you look at a scene that's before you,\n\n1:19:58.140 --> 1:20:01.900\n and you have data about what a successful human driver did\n\n1:20:01.900 --> 1:20:04.460\n in that scene one second later.\n\n1:20:04.460 --> 1:20:06.620\n It's a little piece of data that you can use\n\n1:20:06.620 --> 1:20:09.380\n just like with GPT3 as training.\n\n1:20:09.380 --> 1:20:12.380\n Currently, even though Tesla says they're using that,\n\n1:20:12.380 --> 1:20:15.980\n it's an open question to me, how far can you,\n\n1:20:15.980 --> 1:20:17.420\n can you solve all of the driving\n\n1:20:17.420 --> 1:20:20.940\n with just that self supervised piece of data?\n\n1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:23.380\n And like, I think.\n\n1:20:23.380 --> 1:20:25.540\n Well, that's what Common AI is doing.\n\n1:20:25.540 --> 1:20:26.860\n That's what Common AI is doing,\n\n1:20:26.860 --> 1:20:29.980\n but the question is how much data.\n\n1:20:29.980 --> 1:20:33.580\n So what Common AI doesn't have is as good\n\n1:20:33.580 --> 1:20:35.940\n of a data engine, for example, as Tesla does.\n\n1:20:35.940 --> 1:20:38.580\n That's where the, like the organization of the data.\n\n1:20:39.820 --> 1:20:41.900\n I mean, as far as I know, I haven't talked to George,\n\n1:20:41.900 --> 1:20:44.580\n but they do have the data.\n\n1:20:44.580 --> 1:20:47.860\n The question is how much data is needed,\n\n1:20:47.860 --> 1:20:49.940\n because we say infinite very loosely here.\n\n1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:54.380\n And then the other question, which you said,\n\n1:20:54.380 --> 1:20:57.700\n I don't know if you think it's still an open question is,\n\n1:20:57.700 --> 1:20:59.420\n are we on the right order of magnitude\n\n1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:02.020\n for the compute necessary?\n\n1:21:02.020 --> 1:21:04.940\n That is this, is it like what Elon said,\n\n1:21:04.940 --> 1:21:07.140\n this chip that's in there now is enough\n\n1:21:07.140 --> 1:21:08.620\n to do full self driving,\n\n1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:10.820\n or do we need another order of magnitude?\n\n1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:13.300\n I think nobody actually knows the answer to that question.\n\n1:21:13.300 --> 1:21:15.300\n I like the confidence that Elon has, but.\n\n1:21:16.260 --> 1:21:17.820\n Yeah, we'll see.\n\n1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.180\n There's another funny thing is you don't learn to drive\n\n1:21:20.180 --> 1:21:22.260\n with infinite amounts of data.\n\n1:21:22.260 --> 1:21:24.300\n You learn to drive with an intellectual framework\n\n1:21:24.300 --> 1:21:28.060\n that understands physics and color and horizontal surfaces\n\n1:21:28.060 --> 1:21:32.060\n and laws and roads and all your experience\n\n1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:36.700\n from manipulating your environment.\n\n1:21:36.700 --> 1:21:39.020\n Like, look, there's so many factors go into that.\n\n1:21:39.020 --> 1:21:40.660\n So then when you learn to drive,\n\n1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:44.380\n like driving is a subset of this conceptual framework\n\n1:21:44.380 --> 1:21:46.300\n that you have, right?\n\n1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:48.580\n And so with self driving cars right now,\n\n1:21:48.580 --> 1:21:51.540\n we're teaching them to drive with driving data.\n\n1:21:51.540 --> 1:21:53.580\n You never teach a human to do that.\n\n1:21:53.580 --> 1:21:55.780\n You teach a human all kinds of interesting things,\n\n1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:59.340\n like language, like don't do that, watch out.\n\n1:21:59.340 --> 1:22:01.020\n There's all kinds of stuff going on.\n\n1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:02.900\n Well, this is where you, I think previous time\n\n1:22:02.900 --> 1:22:07.300\n we talked about where you poetically disagreed\n\n1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:10.300\n with my naive notion about humans.\n\n1:22:10.300 --> 1:22:13.700\n I just think that humans will make\n\n1:22:13.700 --> 1:22:15.700\n this whole driving thing really difficult.\n\n1:22:15.700 --> 1:22:17.180\n Yeah, all right.\n\n1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:19.460\n I said, humans don't move that slow.\n\n1:22:19.460 --> 1:22:20.820\n It's a ballistics problem.\n\n1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:22.700\n It's a ballistics, humans are a ballistics problem,\n\n1:22:22.700 --> 1:22:24.060\n which is like poetry to me.\n\n1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:26.180\n It's very possible that in driving\n\n1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:28.460\n they're indeed purely a ballistics problem.\n\n1:22:28.460 --> 1:22:30.860\n And I think that's probably the right way to think about it.\n\n1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:34.420\n But I still, they still continue to surprise me,\n\n1:22:34.420 --> 1:22:36.940\n those damn pedestrians, the cyclists,\n\n1:22:36.940 --> 1:22:39.340\n other humans in other cars and.\n\n1:22:39.340 --> 1:22:41.180\n Yeah, but it's gonna be one of these compensating things.\n\n1:22:41.180 --> 1:22:43.980\n So like when you're driving,\n\n1:22:43.980 --> 1:22:46.860\n you have an intuition about what humans are going to do,\n\n1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.660\n but you don't have 360 cameras and radars\n\n1:22:49.660 --> 1:22:51.140\n and you have an attention problem.\n\n1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:55.100\n So the self driving car comes in with no attention problem,\n\n1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:58.780\n 360 cameras right now, a bunch of other features.\n\n1:22:58.780 --> 1:23:01.980\n So they'll wipe out a whole class of accidents, right?\n\n1:23:01.980 --> 1:23:05.780\n And emergency braking with radar\n\n1:23:05.780 --> 1:23:07.980\n and especially as it gets AI enhanced\n\n1:23:07.980 --> 1:23:10.940\n will eliminate collisions, right?\n\n1:23:10.940 --> 1:23:12.060\n But then you have the other problems\n\n1:23:12.060 --> 1:23:13.860\n of these unexpected things where\n\n1:23:13.860 --> 1:23:15.600\n you think your human intuition is helping,\n\n1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:19.580\n but then the cars also have a set of hardware features\n\n1:23:19.580 --> 1:23:21.500\n that you're not even close to.\n\n1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:25.380\n And the key thing of course is if you wipe out\n\n1:23:25.380 --> 1:23:27.020\n a huge number of kind of accidents,\n\n1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:30.240\n then it might be just way safer than a human driver,\n\n1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:32.980\n even though, even if humans are still a problem,\n\n1:23:32.980 --> 1:23:34.740\n that's hard to figure out.\n\n1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:36.180\n Yeah, that's probably what will happen.\n\n1:23:36.180 --> 1:23:38.820\n Those autonomous cars will have a small number of accidents\n\n1:23:38.820 --> 1:23:41.060\n humans would have avoided, but they'll wipe,\n\n1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:43.840\n they'll get rid of the bulk of them.\n\n1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:48.660\n What do you think about like Tesla's dojo efforts\n\n1:23:48.660 --> 1:23:51.140\n or it can be bigger than Tesla in general.\n\n1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:55.140\n It's kind of like the tense torrent trying to innovate,\n\n1:23:55.140 --> 1:23:58.160\n like this is the dichotomy, like should a company\n\n1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:00.380\n try to from scratch build its own\n\n1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:03.180\n neural network training hardware?\n\n1:24:03.180 --> 1:24:04.260\n Well, first of all, I think it's great.\n\n1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:06.840\n So we need lots of experiments, right?\n\n1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:09.460\n And there's lots of startups working on this\n\n1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:11.580\n and they're pursuing different things.\n\n1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:14.580\n I was there when we started dojo and it was sort of like,\n\n1:24:14.580 --> 1:24:17.980\n what's the unconstrained computer solution\n\n1:24:17.980 --> 1:24:21.760\n to go do very large training problems?\n\n1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:24.520\n And then there's fun stuff like, we said,\n\n1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:27.220\n well, we have this 10,000 watt board to cool.\n\n1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:29.140\n Well, you go talk to guys at SpaceX\n\n1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:31.200\n and they think 10,000 watts is a really small number,\n\n1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:32.740\n not a big number.\n\n1:24:32.740 --> 1:24:35.300\n And there's brilliant people working on it.\n\n1:24:35.300 --> 1:24:37.300\n I'm curious to see how it'll come out.\n\n1:24:37.300 --> 1:24:39.840\n I couldn't tell you, I know it pivoted\n\n1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:41.660\n a few times since I left, so.\n\n1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:44.540\n So the cooling does seem to be a big problem.\n\n1:24:44.540 --> 1:24:47.640\n I do like what Elon said about it, which is like,\n\n1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:50.380\n we don't wanna do the thing unless it's way better\n\n1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:52.980\n than the alternative, whatever the alternative is.\n\n1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:57.620\n So it has to be way better than like racks or GPUs.\n\n1:24:57.620 --> 1:25:00.100\n Yeah, and the other thing is just like,\n\n1:25:00.100 --> 1:25:03.900\n you know, the Tesla autonomous driving hardware,\n\n1:25:03.900 --> 1:25:06.620\n it was only serving one software stack.\n\n1:25:06.620 --> 1:25:08.040\n And the hardware team and the software team\n\n1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:09.880\n were tightly coupled.\n\n1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:12.160\n You know, if you're building a general purpose AI solution,\n\n1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:14.280\n then you know, there's so many different customers\n\n1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:16.420\n with so many different needs.\n\n1:25:16.420 --> 1:25:19.780\n Now, something Andre said is, I think this is amazing.\n\n1:25:19.780 --> 1:25:24.660\n 10 years ago, like vision, recommendation, language,\n\n1:25:24.660 --> 1:25:27.140\n were completely different disciplines.\n\n1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:29.740\n He said, the people literally couldn't talk to each other.\n\n1:25:29.740 --> 1:25:32.580\n And three years ago, it was all neural networks,\n\n1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:34.860\n but the very different neural networks.\n\n1:25:34.860 --> 1:25:37.740\n And recently, it's converging on one set of networks.\n\n1:25:37.740 --> 1:25:40.460\n They vary a lot in size, obviously, they vary in data,\n\n1:25:40.460 --> 1:25:43.820\n vary in outputs, but the technology has converged\n\n1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:44.780\n a good bit.\n\n1:25:44.780 --> 1:25:47.420\n Yeah, these transformers behind GPT3,\n\n1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:48.980\n it seems like they could be applied to video,\n\n1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:51.020\n they could be applied to a lot of, and it's like,\n\n1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:52.500\n and they're all really simple.\n\n1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:56.380\n And it was like they literally replace letters with pixels.\n\n1:25:56.380 --> 1:25:58.780\n It does vision, it's amazing.\n\n1:25:58.780 --> 1:26:02.100\n And then size actually improves the thing.\n\n1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:04.420\n So the bigger it gets, the more compute you throw at it,\n\n1:26:04.420 --> 1:26:05.660\n the better it gets.\n\n1:26:05.660 --> 1:26:08.320\n And the more data you have, the better it gets.\n\n1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:11.220\n So then you start to wonder, well,\n\n1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:12.540\n is that a fundamental thing?\n\n1:26:12.540 --> 1:26:16.580\n Or is this just another step to some fundamental understanding\n\n1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:18.820\n about this kind of computation?\n\n1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:20.300\n Which is really interesting.\n\n1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:22.260\n Us humans don't want to believe that that kind of thing\n\n1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:24.420\n will achieve conceptual understandings, you were saying,\n\n1:26:24.420 --> 1:26:27.000\n like you'll figure out physics, but maybe it will.\n\n1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:27.840\n Maybe.\n\n1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:29.360\n Maybe it will.\n\n1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:31.060\n Well, it's worse than that.\n\n1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:33.780\n It'll understand physics in ways that we can't understand.\n\n1:26:33.780 --> 1:26:36.340\n I like your Stephen Wolfram talk where he said,\n\n1:26:36.340 --> 1:26:38.020\n you know, there's three generations of physics.\n\n1:26:38.020 --> 1:26:40.100\n There was physics by reasoning.\n\n1:26:40.100 --> 1:26:42.620\n Well, big things should fall faster than small things,\n\n1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:43.460\n right?\n\n1:26:43.460 --> 1:26:44.280\n That's reasoning.\n\n1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:46.940\n And then there's physics by equations.\n\n1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:49.620\n Like, you know, but the number of programs in the world\n\n1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:51.980\n that are solved with a single equation is relatively low.\n\n1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:53.660\n Almost all programs have, you know,\n\n1:26:53.660 --> 1:26:56.860\n more than one line of code, maybe 100 million lines of code.\n\n1:26:56.860 --> 1:26:59.980\n So he said, then now we're going to physics by equation,\n\n1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.580\n which is his project, which is cool.\n\n1:27:02.580 --> 1:27:07.260\n I might point out there was two generations of physics\n\n1:27:07.260 --> 1:27:10.240\n before reasoning habit.\n\n1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:12.360\n Like all animals, you know, know things fall\n\n1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:15.300\n and, you know, birds fly and, you know, predators know\n\n1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:17.360\n how to, you know, solve a differential equation\n\n1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:22.360\n to cut off a accelerating, you know, curving animal path.\n\n1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:27.360\n And then there was, you know, the gods did it, right?\n\n1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:29.560\n So, right.\n\n1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:31.620\n So there was, you know, there's five generations.\n\n1:27:31.620 --> 1:27:35.960\n Now, software 2.0 says programming things\n\n1:27:35.960 --> 1:27:37.320\n is not the last step.\n\n1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:39.160\n Data.\n\n1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:44.060\n So there's going to be a physics past Stephen Wolfram's con.\n\n1:27:44.060 --> 1:27:47.520\n That's not explainable to us humans.\n\n1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:51.060\n And actually there's no reason that I can see\n\n1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:53.280\n well that even that's the limit.\n\n1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:55.600\n Like, there's something beyond that.\n\n1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:57.080\n I mean, they're usually, like, usually when you have\n\n1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:59.620\n this hierarchy, it's not like, well, if you have this step\n\n1:27:59.620 --> 1:28:01.840\n and this step and this step and they're all qualitatively\n\n1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:05.100\n different and conceptually different, it's not obvious why,\n\n1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:07.360\n you know, six is the right number of hierarchy steps\n\n1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:09.200\n and not seven or eight or.\n\n1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:12.120\n Well, then it's probably impossible for us to,\n\n1:28:12.120 --> 1:28:15.920\n to comprehend something that's beyond the thing\n\n1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:17.120\n that's not explainable.\n\n1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:19.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.760\n But the thing that, you know, understands the thing\n\n1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:25.120\n that's not explainable to us will conceive the next one.\n\n1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:28.300\n And like, I'm not sure why there's a limit to it.\n\n1:28:30.920 --> 1:28:31.760\n Click your brain hurts.\n\n1:28:31.760 --> 1:28:32.700\n That's a sad story.\n\n1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:37.600\n If we look at our own brain, which is an interesting\n\n1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:42.600\n illustrative example in your work with test story\n\n1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:46.160\n and trying to design deep learning architectures,\n\n1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:50.080\n do you think about the brain at all?\n\n1:28:50.080 --> 1:28:53.500\n Maybe from a hardware designer perspective,\n\n1:28:53.500 --> 1:28:56.240\n if you could change something about the brain,\n\n1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:58.200\n what would you change or do?\n\n1:28:58.200 --> 1:28:59.040\n Funny question.\n\n1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:00.960\n Like, how would you do it?\n\n1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:02.380\n So your brain is really weird.\n\n1:29:02.380 --> 1:29:04.440\n Like, you know, your cerebral cortex where we think\n\n1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.400\n we do most of our thinking is what,\n\n1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:08.660\n like six or seven neurons thick?\n\n1:29:08.660 --> 1:29:09.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:09.500 --> 1:29:10.320\n Like, that's weird.\n\n1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:13.240\n Like all the big networks are way bigger than that.\n\n1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:14.360\n Like way deeper.\n\n1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:16.200\n So that seems odd.\n\n1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.200\n And then, you know, when you're thinking if it's,\n\n1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:21.840\n if the input generates a result you can lose,\n\n1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:22.840\n it goes really fast.\n\n1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:25.280\n But if it can't, that generates an output\n\n1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:27.120\n that's interesting, which turns into an input\n\n1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:29.840\n and then your brain to the point where you mold things\n\n1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:31.560\n over for days and how many trips\n\n1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:33.440\n through your brain is that, right?\n\n1:29:33.440 --> 1:29:36.120\n Like it's, you know, 300 milliseconds or something\n\n1:29:36.120 --> 1:29:37.880\n to get through seven levels of neurons.\n\n1:29:37.880 --> 1:29:39.880\n I forget the number exactly.\n\n1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:43.320\n But then it does it over and over and over as it searches.\n\n1:29:43.320 --> 1:29:46.160\n And the brain clearly looks like some kind of graph\n\n1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:48.200\n because you have a neuron with connections\n\n1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:49.240\n and it talks to other ones\n\n1:29:49.240 --> 1:29:52.400\n and it's locally very computationally intense,\n\n1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:55.520\n but it's also does sparse computations\n\n1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:57.840\n across a pretty big area.\n\n1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:00.680\n There's a lot of messy biological type of things\n\n1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:03.760\n and it's meaning like, first of all,\n\n1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:06.040\n there's mechanical, chemical and electrical signals.\n\n1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:07.480\n It's all that's going on.\n\n1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:12.400\n Then there's the asynchronicity of signals.\n\n1:30:12.400 --> 1:30:14.720\n And there's like, there's just a lot of variability\n\n1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:16.520\n that seems continuous and messy\n\n1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:18.600\n and just the mess of biology.\n\n1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:22.640\n And it's unclear whether that's a good thing\n\n1:30:22.640 --> 1:30:26.320\n or it's a bad thing, because if it's a good thing\n\n1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:29.240\n that we need to run the entirety of the evolution,\n\n1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.560\n well, we're gonna have to start with basic bacteria\n\n1:30:31.560 --> 1:30:32.400\n to create something.\n\n1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:34.000\n So imagine we could control,\n\n1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:35.640\n you could build a brain with 10 layers.\n\n1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:37.360\n Would that be better or worse?\n\n1:30:37.360 --> 1:30:39.800\n Or more connections or less connections,\n\n1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:43.400\n or we don't know to what level our brains are optimized.\n\n1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:45.480\n But if I was changing things,\n\n1:30:45.480 --> 1:30:49.360\n like you can only hold like seven numbers in your head.\n\n1:30:49.360 --> 1:30:51.840\n Like why not a hundred or a million?\n\n1:30:51.840 --> 1:30:53.680\n Never thought of that.\n\n1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:56.800\n And why can't we have like a floating point processor\n\n1:30:56.800 --> 1:30:58.640\n that can compute anything we want\n\n1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:01.240\n and see it all properly?\n\n1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:03.120\n Like that would be kind of fun.\n\n1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:05.760\n And why can't we see in four or eight dimensions?\n\n1:31:05.760 --> 1:31:10.040\n Because 3D is kind of a drag.\n\n1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:11.600\n Like all the hard mass transforms\n\n1:31:11.600 --> 1:31:13.960\n are up in multiple dimensions.\n\n1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:16.560\n So you could imagine a brain architecture\n\n1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:21.120\n that you could enhance with a whole bunch of features\n\n1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:24.440\n that would be really useful for thinking about things.\n\n1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:26.880\n It's possible that the limitations you're describing\n\n1:31:26.880 --> 1:31:29.880\n are actually essential for like the constraints\n\n1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:34.000\n are essential for creating like the depth of intelligence.\n\n1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:37.200\n Like that, the ability to reason.\n\n1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:39.200\n It's hard to say\n\n1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:42.840\n because like your brain is clearly a parallel processor.\n\n1:31:44.360 --> 1:31:46.200\n 10 billion neurons talking to each other\n\n1:31:46.200 --> 1:31:48.440\n at a relatively low clock rate.\n\n1:31:48.440 --> 1:31:50.480\n But it produces something\n\n1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:52.640\n that looks like a serial thought process.\n\n1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:54.720\n It's a serial narrative in your head.\n\n1:31:54.720 --> 1:31:55.560\n That's true.\n\n1:31:55.560 --> 1:31:59.040\n But then there are people famously who are visual thinkers.\n\n1:31:59.040 --> 1:32:02.320\n Like I think I'm a relatively visual thinker.\n\n1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:05.120\n I can imagine any object and rotate it in my head\n\n1:32:05.120 --> 1:32:06.440\n and look at it.\n\n1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:07.360\n And there are people who say\n\n1:32:07.360 --> 1:32:09.640\n they don't think that way at all.\n\n1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:12.440\n And recently I read an article about people\n\n1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:16.240\n who say they don't have a voice in their head.\n\n1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:18.520\n They can talk.\n\n1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:19.880\n But when they, you know, it's like,\n\n1:32:19.880 --> 1:32:21.040\n well, what are you thinking?\n\n1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:23.280\n No, they'll describe something that's visual.\n\n1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:26.480\n So that's curious.\n\n1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:31.480\n Now, if you're saying,\n\n1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:34.960\n if we dedicated more hardware to holding information,\n\n1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:37.960\n like, you know, 10 numbers or a million numbers,\n\n1:32:37.960 --> 1:32:41.680\n like would that distract us from our ability\n\n1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:44.760\n to form this kind of singular identity?\n\n1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:46.960\n Like it dissipates somehow.\n\n1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:49.400\n But maybe, you know, future humans\n\n1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:50.720\n will have many identities\n\n1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:53.120\n that have some higher level organization\n\n1:32:53.120 --> 1:32:55.620\n but can actually do lots more things in parallel.\n\n1:32:55.620 --> 1:32:57.880\n Yeah, there's no reason, if we're thinking modularly,\n\n1:32:57.880 --> 1:33:00.280\n there's no reason we can't have multiple consciousnesses\n\n1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:01.520\n in one brain.\n\n1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:03.720\n Yeah, and maybe there's some way to make it faster\n\n1:33:03.720 --> 1:33:07.920\n so that the, you know, the area of the computation\n\n1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:12.920\n could still have a unified feel to it\n\n1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:15.720\n while still having way more ability\n\n1:33:15.720 --> 1:33:17.600\n to do parallel stuff at the same time.\n\n1:33:17.600 --> 1:33:19.040\n Could definitely be improved.\n\n1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:20.040\n Could be improved?\n\n1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:20.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:20.860 --> 1:33:22.920\n Okay, well, it's pretty good right now.\n\n1:33:22.920 --> 1:33:24.680\n Actually, people don't give it enough credit.\n\n1:33:24.680 --> 1:33:25.880\n The thing is pretty nice.\n\n1:33:25.880 --> 1:33:29.240\n The, you know, the fact that the right ends\n\n1:33:29.240 --> 1:33:32.920\n seem to be, give a nice, like,\n\n1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:37.920\n spark of beauty to the whole experience.\n\n1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:38.760\n I don't know.\n\n1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:40.280\n I don't know if it can be improved easily.\n\n1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:42.480\n It could be more beautiful.\n\n1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:44.320\n I don't know how, I, what?\n\n1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:46.280\n What do you mean, what do you mean how?\n\n1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:48.280\n All the ways you can't imagine.\n\n1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:49.500\n No, but that's the whole point.\n\n1:33:49.500 --> 1:33:51.080\n I wouldn't be able to,\n\n1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:53.200\n the fact that I can imagine ways\n\n1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:55.880\n in which it could be more beautiful means.\n\n1:33:55.880 --> 1:33:59.400\n So do you know, you know, Ian Banks, his stories?\n\n1:33:59.400 --> 1:34:03.600\n So the super smart AIs there live,\n\n1:34:03.600 --> 1:34:06.240\n mostly live in the world of what they call infinite fun\n\n1:34:07.540 --> 1:34:12.200\n because they can create arbitrary worlds.\n\n1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:14.480\n So they interact in, you know, the story has it.\n\n1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:16.720\n They interact in the normal world and they're very smart\n\n1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:18.560\n and they can do all kinds of stuff.\n\n1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:20.420\n And, you know, a given mind can, you know,\n\n1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:22.040\n talk to a million humans at the same time\n\n1:34:22.040 --> 1:34:24.680\n because we're very slow and for reasons,\n\n1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:26.280\n you know, artificial, the story,\n\n1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:28.240\n they're interested in people and doing stuff,\n\n1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:33.000\n but they mostly live in this other land of thinking.\n\n1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.520\n My inclination is to think that the ability\n\n1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:40.120\n to create infinite fun will not be so fun.\n\n1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:42.400\n That's sad.\n\n1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:43.800\n Well, there are so many things to do.\n\n1:34:43.800 --> 1:34:47.600\n Imagine being able to make a star move planets around.\n\n1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:50.080\n Yeah, yeah, but because we can imagine that\n\n1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:53.360\n is why life is fun, if we actually were able to do it,\n\n1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:55.040\n it would be a slippery slope\n\n1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:56.720\n where fun wouldn't even have a meaning\n\n1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:00.320\n because we just consistently desensitize ourselves\n\n1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:03.280\n by the infinite amounts of fun we're having.\n\n1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:07.480\n And the sadness, the dark stuff is what makes it fun.\n\n1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:10.440\n I think that could be the Russian.\n\n1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:12.400\n It could be the fun makes it fun\n\n1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:14.700\n and the sadness makes it bittersweet.\n\n1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:17.400\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:20.560\n Fun could be the thing that makes it fun.\n\n1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:22.560\n So what do you think about the expansion,\n\n1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:23.920\n not through the biology side,\n\n1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:27.220\n but through the BCI, the brain computer interfaces?\n\n1:35:27.220 --> 1:35:30.120\n Yeah, you got a chance to check out the Neuralink stuff.\n\n1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:31.520\n It's super interesting.\n\n1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:36.520\n Like humans like our thoughts to manifest as action.\n\n1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.560\n You know, like as a kid, you know,\n\n1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:41.720\n like shooting a rifle was super fun,\n\n1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:44.320\n driving a mini bike, doing things.\n\n1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:46.160\n And then computer games, I think,\n\n1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:47.920\n for a lot of kids became the thing\n\n1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:50.360\n where they can do what they want.\n\n1:35:50.360 --> 1:35:53.600\n They can fly a plane, they can do this, they can do this.\n\n1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:55.860\n But you have to have this physical interaction.\n\n1:35:55.860 --> 1:36:00.860\n Now imagine, you could just imagine stuff and it happens.\n\n1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:06.620\n Like really richly and interestingly.\n\n1:36:06.620 --> 1:36:08.080\n Like we kind of do that when we dream.\n\n1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:12.040\n Like dreams are funny because like if you have some control\n\n1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:13.520\n or awareness in your dreams,\n\n1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:16.380\n like it's very realistic looking,\n\n1:36:16.380 --> 1:36:19.420\n or not realistic looking, it depends on the dream.\n\n1:36:19.420 --> 1:36:21.240\n But you can also manipulate that.\n\n1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:26.220\n And you know, what's possible there is odd.\n\n1:36:26.220 --> 1:36:29.860\n And the fact that nobody understands it, it's hilarious, but.\n\n1:36:29.860 --> 1:36:31.780\n Do you think it's possible to expand\n\n1:36:31.780 --> 1:36:34.060\n that capability through computing?\n\n1:36:34.060 --> 1:36:35.340\n Sure.\n\n1:36:35.340 --> 1:36:36.500\n Is there some interesting,\n\n1:36:36.500 --> 1:36:38.420\n so from a hardware designer perspective,\n\n1:36:38.420 --> 1:36:41.660\n is there, do you think it'll present totally new challenges\n\n1:36:41.660 --> 1:36:44.100\n in the kind of hardware required that like,\n\n1:36:44.100 --> 1:36:47.740\n so this hardware isn't standalone computing.\n\n1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:49.540\n Well, this is not working with the brain.\n\n1:36:49.540 --> 1:36:52.860\n So today, computer games are rendered by GPUs.\n\n1:36:52.860 --> 1:36:53.700\n Right.\n\n1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:56.840\n Right, so, but you've seen the GAN stuff, right?\n\n1:36:56.840 --> 1:37:00.900\n Where trained neural networks render realistic images,\n\n1:37:00.900 --> 1:37:03.740\n but there's no pixels, no triangles, no shaders,\n\n1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:05.400\n no light maps, no nothing.\n\n1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:09.540\n So the future of graphics is probably AI, right?\n\n1:37:09.540 --> 1:37:10.380\n Yes.\n\n1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:14.820\n AI is heavily trained by lots of real data, right?\n\n1:37:14.820 --> 1:37:19.820\n So if you have an interface with a AI renderer, right?\n\n1:37:20.340 --> 1:37:23.420\n So if you say render a cat, it won't say,\n\n1:37:23.420 --> 1:37:25.060\n well, how tall's the cat and how big it,\n\n1:37:25.060 --> 1:37:26.260\n you know, it'll render a cat.\n\n1:37:26.260 --> 1:37:28.220\n And you might say, oh, a little bigger, a little smaller,\n\n1:37:28.220 --> 1:37:31.060\n you know, make it a tabby, shorter hair.\n\n1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:32.900\n You know, like you could tweak it.\n\n1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:36.500\n Like the amount of data you'll have to send\n\n1:37:36.500 --> 1:37:40.120\n to interact with a very powerful AI renderer\n\n1:37:40.120 --> 1:37:41.420\n could be low.\n\n1:37:41.420 --> 1:37:44.780\n But the question is brain computer interfaces\n\n1:37:44.780 --> 1:37:47.860\n would need to render not onto a screen,\n\n1:37:47.860 --> 1:37:51.980\n but render onto the brain and like directly\n\n1:37:51.980 --> 1:37:52.820\n so that there's a bandwidth.\n\n1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:53.880\n Well, it could do it both ways.\n\n1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.020\n I mean, our eyes are really good sensors.\n\n1:37:56.020 --> 1:37:58.580\n They could render onto a screen\n\n1:37:58.580 --> 1:38:01.100\n and we could feel like we're participating in it.\n\n1:38:01.100 --> 1:38:03.360\n You know, they're gonna have, you know,\n\n1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:04.860\n like the Oculus kind of stuff.\n\n1:38:04.860 --> 1:38:07.020\n It's gonna be so good when a projection to your eyes,\n\n1:38:07.020 --> 1:38:08.040\n you think it's real.\n\n1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:11.620\n You know, they're slowly solving those problems.\n\n1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.240\n And I suspect when the renderer of that information\n\n1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:19.760\n into your head is also AI mediated,\n\n1:38:19.760 --> 1:38:23.520\n they'll be able to give you the cues that, you know,\n\n1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:26.200\n you really want for depth and all kinds of stuff.\n\n1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:30.920\n Like your brain is partly faking your visual field, right?\n\n1:38:30.920 --> 1:38:32.680\n Like your eyes are twitching around,\n\n1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:33.800\n but you don't notice that.\n\n1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:36.520\n Occasionally they blank, you don't notice that.\n\n1:38:36.520 --> 1:38:37.800\n You know, there's all kinds of things.\n\n1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:39.160\n Like you think you see over here,\n\n1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:40.840\n but you don't really see there.\n\n1:38:40.840 --> 1:38:42.200\n It's all fabricated.\n\n1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:45.520\n Yeah, peripheral vision is fascinating.\n\n1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:48.560\n So if you have an AI renderer that's trained\n\n1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:51.700\n to understand exactly how you see\n\n1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:54.760\n and the kind of things that enhance the realism\n\n1:38:54.760 --> 1:38:57.660\n of the experience, it could be super real actually.\n\n1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:03.520\n So I don't know what the limits to that are,\n\n1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:06.960\n but obviously if we have a brain interface\n\n1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:10.480\n that goes inside your visual cortex\n\n1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:13.480\n in a better way than your eyes do, which is possible,\n\n1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.480\n it's a lot of neurons, maybe that'll be even cooler.\n\n1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:21.600\n Well, the really cool thing is that it has to do\n\n1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:24.240\n with the infinite fun that you were referring to,\n\n1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:26.640\n which is our brains seem to be very limited.\n\n1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:28.360\n And like you said, computations.\n\n1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:29.920\n It's also very plastic.\n\n1:39:29.920 --> 1:39:30.920\n Very plastic, yeah.\n\n1:39:30.920 --> 1:39:33.640\n Yeah, so it's a interesting combination.\n\n1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:37.480\n The interesting open question is the limits\n\n1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:42.320\n of that neuroplasticity, like how flexible is that thing?\n\n1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:44.880\n Because we haven't really tested it.\n\n1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:46.240\n We know about that at the experiments\n\n1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:49.120\n where they put like a pressure pad on somebody's head\n\n1:39:49.120 --> 1:39:51.520\n and had a visual transducer pressurize it\n\n1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:53.440\n and somebody slowly learned to see.\n\n1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:54.280\n Yep.\n\n1:39:55.880 --> 1:39:58.720\n Especially at a young age, if you throw a lot at it,\n\n1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:03.720\n like what can it, so can you like arbitrarily expand it\n\n1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:06.880\n with computing power?\n\n1:40:06.880 --> 1:40:09.880\n So connected to the internet directly somehow?\n\n1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.960\n Yeah, the answer's probably yes.\n\n1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:13.840\n So the problem with biology and ethics\n\n1:40:13.840 --> 1:40:15.560\n is like there's a mess there.\n\n1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:20.560\n Like us humans are perhaps unwilling to take risks\n\n1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:25.600\n into directions that are full of uncertainty.\n\n1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:26.440\n So it's like. No, no.\n\n1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:28.880\n 90% of the population's unwilling to take risks.\n\n1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:31.360\n The other 10% is rushing into the risks\n\n1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:34.400\n unaided by any infrastructure whatsoever.\n\n1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:38.960\n And that's where all the fun happens in society.\n\n1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:41.160\n There's been huge transformations\n\n1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:43.600\n in the last couple thousand years.\n\n1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:44.560\n Yeah, it's funny.\n\n1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:48.200\n I got a chance to interact with this Matthew Johnson\n\n1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:49.360\n from Johns Hopkins.\n\n1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:52.520\n He's doing this large scale study of psychedelics.\n\n1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:54.240\n It's becoming more and more,\n\n1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:55.240\n I've gotten a chance to interact\n\n1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:57.760\n with that community of scientists working on psychedelics.\n\n1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:00.080\n But because of that, that opened the door to me\n\n1:41:00.080 --> 1:41:02.740\n to all these, what do they call it?\n\n1:41:02.740 --> 1:41:05.340\n Psychonauts, the people who, like you said,\n\n1:41:05.340 --> 1:41:08.000\n the 10% who are like, I don't care.\n\n1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:09.840\n I don't know if there's a science behind this.\n\n1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:12.040\n I'm taking this spaceship to,\n\n1:41:12.040 --> 1:41:14.180\n if I'm being the first on Mars, I'll be.\n\n1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:17.440\n Psychedelics are interesting in the sense\n\n1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:21.400\n that in another dimension, like you said,\n\n1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:25.440\n it's a way to explore the limits of the human mind.\n\n1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.240\n Like, what is this thing capable of doing?\n\n1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:31.440\n Because you kind of, like when you dream, you detach it.\n\n1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:33.080\n I don't know exactly the neuroscience of it,\n\n1:41:33.080 --> 1:41:38.080\n but you detach your reality from what your mind,\n\n1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.800\n the images your mind is able to conjure up\n\n1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:44.960\n and your mind goes into weird places and entities appear.\n\n1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:48.800\n Somehow Freudian type of trauma\n\n1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:50.320\n is probably connected in there somehow,\n\n1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:54.040\n but you start to have these weird, vivid worlds that like.\n\n1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:55.540\n So do you actively dream?\n\n1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.220\n Do you, why not?\n\n1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:01.360\n I have like six hours of dreams a night.\n\n1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.140\n It's like really useful time.\n\n1:42:03.140 --> 1:42:06.160\n I know, I haven't, I don't for some reason.\n\n1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:11.040\n I just knock out and I have sometimes anxiety inducing\n\n1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:16.040\n kind of like very pragmatic nightmare type of dreams,\n\n1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:18.480\n but nothing fun, nothing.\n\n1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:19.320\n Nothing fun?\n\n1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:20.640\n Nothing fun.\n\n1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:24.640\n I try, I unfortunately have mostly have fun\n\n1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:27.760\n in the waking world, which is very limited\n\n1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:30.040\n in the amount of fun you can have.\n\n1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:31.240\n It's not that limited either.\n\n1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:32.600\n Yeah, that's why.\n\n1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:33.440\n We'll have to talk.\n\n1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:36.840\n Yeah, I need instructions.\n\n1:42:36.840 --> 1:42:37.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:38.680\n There's like a manual for that.\n\n1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:39.520\n You might wanna.\n\n1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:41.860\n I'll look it up.\n\n1:42:41.860 --> 1:42:42.700\n I'll ask Elon.\n\n1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:44.720\n What would you dream?\n\n1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:47.120\n You know, years ago when I read about, you know,\n\n1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:51.360\n like, you know, a book about how to have, you know,\n\n1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:53.080\n become aware of your dreams.\n\n1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:54.320\n I worked on it for a while.\n\n1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:55.980\n Like there's this trick about, you know,\n\n1:42:55.980 --> 1:42:58.280\n imagine you can see your hands and look out\n\n1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:00.640\n and I got somewhat good at it.\n\n1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:04.400\n Like, but my mostly, when I'm thinking about things\n\n1:43:04.400 --> 1:43:09.040\n or working on problems, I prep myself before I go to sleep.\n\n1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:13.160\n It's like, I pull into my mind all the things\n\n1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:15.440\n I wanna work on or think about.\n\n1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:19.840\n And then that, let's say, greatly improves the chances\n\n1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:22.140\n that I'll work on that while I'm sleeping.\n\n1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:28.400\n And then I also, you know, basically ask to remember it.\n\n1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:33.180\n And I often remember very detailed.\n\n1:43:33.180 --> 1:43:34.120\n Within the dream.\n\n1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:34.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:35.780\n Or outside the dream.\n\n1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:37.840\n Well, to bring it up in my dreaming\n\n1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:39.740\n and then to remember it when I wake up.\n\n1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:43.360\n It's just, it's more of a meditative practice.\n\n1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:47.920\n You say, you know, to prepare yourself to do that.\n\n1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:50.600\n Like if you go to, you know, to sleep,\n\n1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:52.960\n still gnashing your teeth about some random thing\n\n1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:55.800\n that happened that you're not that really interested in,\n\n1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:56.960\n you'll dream about it.\n\n1:43:57.960 --> 1:43:58.840\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:43:58.840 --> 1:43:59.680\n Maybe.\n\n1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:03.460\n But you can direct your dreams somewhat by prepping.\n\n1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:05.480\n Yeah, I'm gonna have to try that.\n\n1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:06.400\n It's really interesting.\n\n1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:08.480\n Like the most important, the interesting,\n\n1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.240\n not like what did this guy send in an email\n\n1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:14.080\n kind of like stupid worry stuff,\n\n1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:15.240\n but like fundamental problems\n\n1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:16.320\n you're actually concerned about.\n\n1:44:16.320 --> 1:44:17.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:18.200\n And interesting things you're worried about.\n\n1:44:18.200 --> 1:44:20.040\n Or books you're reading or, you know,\n\n1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:21.360\n some great conversation you had\n\n1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:23.480\n or some adventure you want to have.\n\n1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:26.720\n Like there's a lot of space there.\n\n1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:32.520\n And it seems to work that, you know,\n\n1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:36.440\n my percentage of interesting dreams and memories went up.\n\n1:44:36.440 --> 1:44:40.440\n Is there, is that the source of,\n\n1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:42.280\n if you were able to deconstruct like\n\n1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:44.560\n where some of your best ideas came from,\n\n1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:49.400\n is there a process that's at the core of that?\n\n1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:52.420\n Like, so some people, you know, walk and think,\n\n1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:55.160\n some people like in the shower, the best ideas hit them.\n\n1:44:55.160 --> 1:44:58.560\n If you talk about like Newton, Apple hitting them on the head.\n\n1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:01.080\n No, I found out a long time ago,\n\n1:45:01.080 --> 1:45:03.200\n I process things somewhat slowly.\n\n1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:05.680\n So like in college, I had friends who could study\n\n1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:07.520\n at the last minute, get an A the next day.\n\n1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:09.060\n I can't do that at all.\n\n1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:10.920\n So I always front loaded all the work.\n\n1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:14.160\n Like I do all the problems early, you know,\n\n1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:15.800\n for finals, like the last three days,\n\n1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:18.840\n I wouldn't look at a book because I want, you know,\n\n1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:22.200\n cause like a new fact day before finals may screw up\n\n1:45:22.200 --> 1:45:23.880\n my understanding of what I thought I knew.\n\n1:45:23.880 --> 1:45:28.880\n So my goal was to always get it in and give it time to soak.\n\n1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:32.060\n And I used to, you know,\n\n1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:33.780\n I remember when we were doing like 3D calculus,\n\n1:45:33.780 --> 1:45:36.280\n I would have these amazing dreams of 3D surfaces\n\n1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:38.560\n with normal, you know, calculating the gradient.\n\n1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:40.160\n And it's just like all come up.\n\n1:45:40.160 --> 1:45:43.920\n So it was like really fun, like very visual.\n\n1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:47.440\n And if I got cycles of that, that was useful.\n\n1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:50.960\n And the other is, is don't over filter your ideas.\n\n1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:54.520\n Like I like that process of brainstorming\n\n1:45:54.520 --> 1:45:55.640\n where lots of ideas can happen.\n\n1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:57.360\n I like people who have lots of ideas.\n\n1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:00.240\n But then there's a, yeah, I'll let them sit\n\n1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:02.560\n and let it breathe a little bit\n\n1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.960\n and then reduce it to practice.\n\n1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:09.920\n Like at some point you really have to, does it really work?\n\n1:46:09.920 --> 1:46:13.360\n Like, you know, is this real or not, right?\n\n1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:15.020\n But you have to do both.\n\n1:46:15.020 --> 1:46:16.160\n There's creative tension there.\n\n1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:20.480\n Like how do you be both open and, you know, precise?\n\n1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:22.280\n Have you had ideas that you just,\n\n1:46:22.280 --> 1:46:26.120\n that sit in your mind for like years before the?\n\n1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:27.640\n Sure.\n\n1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:31.760\n It's an interesting way to just generate ideas\n\n1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:35.080\n and just let them sit, let them sit there for a while.\n\n1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:38.480\n I think I have a few of those ideas.\n\n1:46:38.480 --> 1:46:40.160\n You know, that was so funny.\n\n1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:42.440\n Yeah, I think that's, you know,\n\n1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:44.740\n creativity this one or something.\n\n1:46:45.740 --> 1:46:49.380\n For the slow thinkers in the room, I suppose.\n\n1:46:49.380 --> 1:46:53.300\n As I, some people, like you said, are just like, like the.\n\n1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:54.840\n Yeah, it's really interesting.\n\n1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:57.680\n There's so much diversity in how people think.\n\n1:46:57.680 --> 1:46:59.320\n You know, how fast or slow they are,\n\n1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:01.660\n how well they remember or don't.\n\n1:47:01.660 --> 1:47:04.040\n Like, you know, I'm not super good at remembering facts,\n\n1:47:04.040 --> 1:47:06.440\n but processes and methods.\n\n1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:08.040\n Like in our engineering, I went to Penn State\n\n1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:11.860\n and almost all our engineering tests were open book.\n\n1:47:11.860 --> 1:47:14.800\n I could remember the page and not the formula.\n\n1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:15.920\n But as soon as I saw the formula,\n\n1:47:15.920 --> 1:47:19.720\n I could remember the whole method if I'd learned it.\n\n1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:20.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:23.480\n So it's just a funny, where some people could, you know,\n\n1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:25.580\n I'd watch friends like flipping through the book,\n\n1:47:25.580 --> 1:47:27.440\n trying to find the formula,\n\n1:47:27.440 --> 1:47:30.080\n even knowing that they'd done just as much work.\n\n1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:31.240\n And I would just open the book\n\n1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:33.680\n and I was on page 27, about half,\n\n1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:35.960\n I could see the whole thing visually.\n\n1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:36.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:37.640\n And, you know.\n\n1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:39.040\n And you have to learn that about yourself\n\n1:47:39.040 --> 1:47:41.480\n and figure out what would function optimally.\n\n1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:43.320\n I had a friend who was always concerned\n\n1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:45.760\n he didn't know how he came up with ideas.\n\n1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:49.160\n He had lots of ideas, but he said they just sort of popped up.\n\n1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:51.080\n Like, you'd be working on something, you have this idea,\n\n1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:53.360\n like, where does it come from?\n\n1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:54.840\n But you can have more awareness of it.\n\n1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:59.760\n Like, how your brain works is a little murky\n\n1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:01.600\n as you go down from the voice in your head\n\n1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:03.920\n or the obvious visualizations.\n\n1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:06.580\n Like, when you visualize something, how does that happen?\n\n1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:07.420\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:48:07.420 --> 1:48:09.080\n You know, if I say, you know, visualize a volcano,\n\n1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:10.320\n it's easy to do, right?\n\n1:48:10.320 --> 1:48:12.560\n And what does it actually look like when you visualize it?\n\n1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:14.880\n I can visualize to the point where I don't see very much\n\n1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:16.280\n out of my eyes and I see the colors\n\n1:48:16.280 --> 1:48:18.280\n of the thing I'm visualizing.\n\n1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:20.600\n Yeah, but there's a shape, there's a texture,\n\n1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:23.160\n there's a color, but there's also conceptual visualization.\n\n1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:25.720\n Like, what are you actually visualizing\n\n1:48:25.720 --> 1:48:27.240\n when you're visualizing a volcano?\n\n1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:28.480\n Just like with peripheral vision,\n\n1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:29.720\n you think you see the whole thing.\n\n1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:31.840\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good way to say it.\n\n1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:34.860\n You know, you have this kind of almost peripheral vision\n\n1:48:34.860 --> 1:48:37.440\n of your visualizations, they're like these ghosts.\n\n1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:40.200\n But if, you know, if you work on it,\n\n1:48:40.200 --> 1:48:42.320\n you can get a pretty high level of detail.\n\n1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:44.400\n And somehow you can walk along those visualizations\n\n1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:47.240\n and come up with an idea, which is weird.\n\n1:48:47.240 --> 1:48:50.940\n But when you're thinking about solving problems,\n\n1:48:50.940 --> 1:48:53.000\n like, you're putting information in,\n\n1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.760\n you're exercising the stuff you do know,\n\n1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:59.400\n you're sort of teasing the area that you don't understand\n\n1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:02.240\n and don't know, but you can almost, you know,\n\n1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:06.600\n feel, you know, that process happening.\n\n1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:08.360\n You know, that's how I, like,\n\n1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:12.040\n like, I know sometimes when I'm working really hard\n\n1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:14.920\n on something, like, I get really hot when I'm sleeping.\n\n1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:17.320\n And, you know, it's like, we got the blank throw,\n\n1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:20.080\n I wake up, all the blanks are on the floor.\n\n1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:21.920\n And, you know, every time it's, well,\n\n1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:24.880\n I wake up and think, wow, that was great.\n\n1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:25.720\n You know?\n\n1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:27.600\n Are you able to reverse engineer\n\n1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:28.960\n what the hell happened there?\n\n1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:30.360\n Well, sometimes it's vivid dreams\n\n1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:32.500\n and sometimes it's just kind of, like you say,\n\n1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:35.120\n like shadow thinking that you sort of have this feeling\n\n1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:38.720\n you're going through this stuff, but it's not that obvious.\n\n1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:40.320\n Isn't that so amazing that the mind\n\n1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:42.880\n just does all these little experiments?\n\n1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:46.040\n I never, you know, I always thought it's like a river\n\n1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:48.160\n that you can't, you're just there for the ride,\n\n1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:50.360\n but you're right, if you prep it.\n\n1:49:50.360 --> 1:49:52.400\n No, it's all understandable.\n\n1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:53.720\n Meditation really helps.\n\n1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:55.160\n You gotta start figuring out,\n\n1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:59.320\n you need to learn language of your own mind.\n\n1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:02.600\n And there's multiple levels of it, but.\n\n1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:04.040\n The abstractions again, right?\n\n1:50:04.040 --> 1:50:06.700\n It's somewhat comprehensible and observable\n\n1:50:06.700 --> 1:50:10.000\n and feelable or whatever the right word is.\n\n1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:13.680\n You know, you're not alone for the ride.\n\n1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:15.600\n You are the ride.\n\n1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:17.960\n I have to ask you, hardware engineer,\n\n1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:21.420\n working on neural networks now, what's consciousness?\n\n1:50:21.420 --> 1:50:22.840\n What the hell is that thing?\n\n1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:25.960\n Is that just some little weird quirk\n\n1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:29.280\n of our particular computing device?\n\n1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:30.560\n Or is it something fundamental\n\n1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:32.040\n that we really need to crack open\n\n1:50:32.040 --> 1:50:36.560\n if we're to build good computers?\n\n1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:37.940\n Do you ever think about consciousness?\n\n1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:39.960\n Like why it feels like something to be?\n\n1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:41.760\n I know, it's really weird.\n\n1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:43.680\n So.\n\n1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:44.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:48.000\n I mean, everything about it's weird.\n\n1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:51.340\n First, it's a half a second behind reality, right?\n\n1:50:51.340 --> 1:50:53.780\n It's a post hoc narrative about what happened.\n\n1:50:53.780 --> 1:50:55.640\n You've already done stuff\n\n1:50:56.520 --> 1:50:58.880\n by the time you're conscious of it.\n\n1:50:58.880 --> 1:51:00.160\n And your consciousness generally\n\n1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:01.240\n is a single threaded thing,\n\n1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.680\n but we know your brain is 10 billion neurons\n\n1:51:03.680 --> 1:51:07.980\n running some crazy parallel thing.\n\n1:51:07.980 --> 1:51:11.200\n And there's a really big sorting thing going on there.\n\n1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:13.040\n It also seems to be really reflective\n\n1:51:13.040 --> 1:51:18.000\n in the sense that you create a space in your head.\n\n1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.640\n Like we don't really see anything, right?\n\n1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:21.600\n Like photons hit your eyes,\n\n1:51:21.600 --> 1:51:22.840\n it gets turned into signals,\n\n1:51:22.840 --> 1:51:25.000\n it goes through multiple layers of neurons.\n\n1:51:26.600 --> 1:51:29.160\n I'm so curious that that looks glassy\n\n1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:30.480\n and that looks not glassy.\n\n1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:33.520\n Like how the resolution of your vision is so high\n\n1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:36.080\n you have to go through all this processing.\n\n1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:38.760\n Where for most of it, it looks nothing like vision.\n\n1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:43.640\n Like there's no theater in your mind, right?\n\n1:51:43.640 --> 1:51:46.820\n So we have a world in our heads.\n\n1:51:46.820 --> 1:51:51.740\n We're literally just isolated behind our sensors.\n\n1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:55.580\n But we can look at it, speculate about it,\n\n1:51:55.580 --> 1:52:00.240\n speculate about alternatives, problem solve, what if.\n\n1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:02.880\n There's so many things going on\n\n1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:06.200\n and that process is lagging reality.\n\n1:52:06.200 --> 1:52:07.580\n And it's single threaded\n\n1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:10.460\n even though the underlying thing is like massively parallel.\n\n1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:12.780\n So it's so curious.\n\n1:52:12.780 --> 1:52:14.520\n So imagine you're building an AI computer.\n\n1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:16.380\n If you wanted to replicate humans,\n\n1:52:16.380 --> 1:52:18.380\n well, you'd have huge arrays of neural networks\n\n1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:22.420\n and apparently only six or seven deep, which is hilarious.\n\n1:52:22.420 --> 1:52:23.780\n They don't even remember seven numbers,\n\n1:52:23.780 --> 1:52:26.220\n but I think we can upgrade that a lot, right?\n\n1:52:26.220 --> 1:52:28.240\n And then somewhere in there,\n\n1:52:28.240 --> 1:52:30.020\n you would train the network to create\n\n1:52:30.020 --> 1:52:32.860\n basically the world that you live in, right?\n\n1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:34.860\n So like tell stories to itself\n\n1:52:34.860 --> 1:52:36.800\n about the world that it's perceiving.\n\n1:52:36.800 --> 1:52:40.820\n Well, create the world, tell stories in the world\n\n1:52:40.820 --> 1:52:45.820\n and then have many dimensions of like side shows to it.\n\n1:52:47.660 --> 1:52:49.340\n Like we have an emotional structure,\n\n1:52:49.340 --> 1:52:51.500\n like we have a biological structure.\n\n1:52:51.500 --> 1:52:52.740\n And that seems hierarchical too.\n\n1:52:52.740 --> 1:52:55.620\n Like if you're hungry, it dominates your thinking.\n\n1:52:55.620 --> 1:52:57.660\n If you're mad, it dominates your thinking.\n\n1:52:59.220 --> 1:53:00.380\n And we don't know if that's important\n\n1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:01.300\n to consciousness or not,\n\n1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:05.740\n but it certainly disrupts, intrudes in the consciousness.\n\n1:53:05.740 --> 1:53:08.160\n Like so there's lots of structure to that.\n\n1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:09.880\n And we like to dwell on the past.\n\n1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:11.280\n We like to think about the future.\n\n1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:14.740\n We like to imagine, we like to fantasize, right?\n\n1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:18.580\n And the somewhat circular observation of that\n\n1:53:18.580 --> 1:53:20.620\n is the thing we call consciousness.\n\n1:53:21.760 --> 1:53:23.340\n Now, if you created a computer system\n\n1:53:23.340 --> 1:53:24.900\n and did all things, create worldviews,\n\n1:53:24.900 --> 1:53:27.620\n create the future alternate histories,\n\n1:53:27.620 --> 1:53:31.340\n dwelled on past events, accurately or semi accurately.\n\n1:53:33.020 --> 1:53:35.380\n Well, consciousness just spring up like naturally.\n\n1:53:35.380 --> 1:53:38.100\n Well, would that look and feel conscious to you?\n\n1:53:38.100 --> 1:53:39.940\n Like you seem conscious to me, but I don't know.\n\n1:53:39.940 --> 1:53:41.780\n Off of the external observer sense.\n\n1:53:41.780 --> 1:53:44.940\n Do you think a thing that looks conscious is conscious?\n\n1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:48.220\n Like do you, again, this is like an engineering\n\n1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:50.220\n kind of question, I think, because like.\n\n1:53:53.900 --> 1:53:54.860\n I don't know.\n\n1:53:54.860 --> 1:53:56.840\n If we want to engineer consciousness,\n\n1:53:56.840 --> 1:53:58.300\n is it okay to engineer something\n\n1:53:58.300 --> 1:53:59.740\n that just looks conscious?\n\n1:54:00.740 --> 1:54:02.660\n Or is there a difference between something that is?\n\n1:54:02.660 --> 1:54:04.060\n Well, we evolve consciousness\n\n1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:07.140\n because it's a super effective way to manage our affairs.\n\n1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:09.020\n Yeah, this is a social element, yeah.\n\n1:54:09.020 --> 1:54:11.540\n Well, it gives us a planning system.\n\n1:54:11.540 --> 1:54:13.280\n We have a huge amount of stuff.\n\n1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:15.220\n Like when we're talking, like the reason\n\n1:54:15.220 --> 1:54:17.260\n we can talk really fast is we're modeling each other\n\n1:54:17.260 --> 1:54:19.100\n at a really high level of detail.\n\n1:54:19.100 --> 1:54:21.340\n And consciousness is required for that.\n\n1:54:21.340 --> 1:54:23.740\n Well, all those components together\n\n1:54:23.740 --> 1:54:26.740\n manifest consciousness, right?\n\n1:54:26.740 --> 1:54:28.460\n So if we make intelligent beings\n\n1:54:28.460 --> 1:54:30.820\n that we want to interact with that we're like\n\n1:54:30.820 --> 1:54:32.860\n wondering what they're thinking,\n\n1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:35.140\n looking forward to seeing them,\n\n1:54:35.140 --> 1:54:37.280\n when they interact with them, they're interesting,\n\n1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:41.460\n surprising, you know, fascinating, you know,\n\n1:54:41.460 --> 1:54:43.500\n they will probably feel conscious like we do\n\n1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:45.400\n and we'll perceive them as conscious.\n\n1:54:47.180 --> 1:54:49.980\n I don't know why not, but you never know.\n\n1:54:49.980 --> 1:54:51.460\n Another fun question on this,\n\n1:54:51.460 --> 1:54:55.020\n because from a computing perspective,\n\n1:54:55.020 --> 1:54:55.980\n we're trying to create something\n\n1:54:55.980 --> 1:54:57.820\n that's humanlike or superhumanlike.\n\n1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:01.280\n Let me ask you about aliens.\n\n1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:02.120\n Aliens.\n\n1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:07.120\n Do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations\n\n1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:13.160\n out there and do you think their technology,\n\n1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:16.480\n their computing, their AI bots,\n\n1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:21.280\n their chips are of the same nature as ours?\n\n1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:23.120\n Yeah, I've got no idea.\n\n1:55:23.120 --> 1:55:25.000\n I mean, if there's lots of aliens out there\n\n1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:26.440\n that have been awfully quiet,\n\n1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:29.620\n you know, there's speculation about why.\n\n1:55:29.620 --> 1:55:34.620\n There seems to be more than enough planets out there.\n\n1:55:34.940 --> 1:55:35.780\n There's a lot.\n\n1:55:37.460 --> 1:55:38.980\n There's intelligent life on this planet\n\n1:55:38.980 --> 1:55:40.500\n that seems quite different, you know,\n\n1:55:40.500 --> 1:55:44.580\n like dolphins seem like plausibly understandable,\n\n1:55:44.580 --> 1:55:47.620\n octopuses don't seem understandable at all.\n\n1:55:47.620 --> 1:55:48.820\n If they lived longer than a year,\n\n1:55:48.820 --> 1:55:50.980\n maybe they would be running the planet.\n\n1:55:50.980 --> 1:55:52.700\n They seem really smart.\n\n1:55:52.700 --> 1:55:54.260\n And their neural architecture\n\n1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:56.540\n is completely different than ours.\n\n1:55:56.540 --> 1:55:58.700\n Now, who knows how they perceive things.\n\n1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:01.180\n I mean, that's the question is for us intelligent beings,\n\n1:56:01.180 --> 1:56:03.620\n we might not be able to perceive other kinds of intelligence\n\n1:56:03.620 --> 1:56:05.580\n if they become sufficiently different than us.\n\n1:56:05.580 --> 1:56:08.940\n Yeah, like we live in the current constrained world,\n\n1:56:08.940 --> 1:56:10.660\n you know, it's three dimensional geometry\n\n1:56:10.660 --> 1:56:14.500\n and the geometry defines a certain amount of physics.\n\n1:56:14.500 --> 1:56:18.560\n And, you know, there's like how time works seems to work.\n\n1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:21.100\n There's so many things that seem like\n\n1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:23.500\n a whole bunch of the input parameters to the, you know,\n\n1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:25.540\n another conscious being are the same.\n\n1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:28.180\n Yes, like if it's biological,\n\n1:56:28.180 --> 1:56:30.020\n biological things seem to be\n\n1:56:30.020 --> 1:56:32.940\n in a relatively narrow temperature range, right?\n\n1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:35.620\n Because, you know, organics aren't stable,\n\n1:56:35.620 --> 1:56:37.740\n too cold or too hot.\n\n1:56:37.740 --> 1:56:42.740\n Now, so if you specify the list of things that input to that,\n\n1:56:45.260 --> 1:56:49.620\n but as soon as we make really smart, you know, beings\n\n1:56:49.620 --> 1:56:51.140\n and they go solve about how to think\n\n1:56:51.140 --> 1:56:52.940\n about a billion numbers at the same time\n\n1:56:52.940 --> 1:56:56.060\n and how to think in end dimensions.\n\n1:56:56.060 --> 1:56:57.340\n There's a funny science fiction book\n\n1:56:57.340 --> 1:57:01.620\n where all the society had uploaded into this matrix.\n\n1:57:01.620 --> 1:57:05.340\n And at some point, some of the beings in the matrix thought,\n\n1:57:05.340 --> 1:57:07.900\n I wonder if there's intelligent life out there.\n\n1:57:07.900 --> 1:57:09.940\n So they had to do a whole bunch of work to figure out\n\n1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:12.380\n like how to make a physical thing\n\n1:57:12.380 --> 1:57:15.000\n because their matrix was self sustaining\n\n1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:16.140\n and they made a little spaceship\n\n1:57:16.140 --> 1:57:18.540\n and they traveled to another planet when they got there,\n\n1:57:18.540 --> 1:57:20.660\n there was like life running around,\n\n1:57:20.660 --> 1:57:22.700\n but there was no intelligent life.\n\n1:57:22.700 --> 1:57:25.340\n And then they figured out that there was these huge,\n\n1:57:26.260 --> 1:57:28.780\n you know, organic matrix all over the planet\n\n1:57:28.780 --> 1:57:30.540\n inside there where intelligent beings\n\n1:57:30.540 --> 1:57:33.720\n had uploaded themselves into that matrix.\n\n1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:38.220\n So everywhere intelligent life was,\n\n1:57:38.220 --> 1:57:42.180\n soon as it got smart, it upleveled itself\n\n1:57:42.180 --> 1:57:45.180\n into something way more interesting than 3D geometry.\n\n1:57:45.180 --> 1:57:47.100\n Yeah, it escaped whatever this,\n\n1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:49.780\n not escaped, uplevel is better.\n\n1:57:49.780 --> 1:57:53.180\n The essence of what we think of as an intelligent being,\n\n1:57:53.180 --> 1:57:58.100\n I tend to like the thought experiment of the organism,\n\n1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:00.340\n like humans aren't the organisms.\n\n1:58:00.340 --> 1:58:03.700\n I like the notion of like Richard Dawkins and memes\n\n1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:07.980\n that ideas themselves are the organisms,\n\n1:58:07.980 --> 1:58:11.460\n like that are just using our minds to evolve.\n\n1:58:11.460 --> 1:58:15.180\n So like we're just like meat receptacles\n\n1:58:15.180 --> 1:58:18.140\n for ideas to breed and multiply and so on.\n\n1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:20.980\n And maybe those are the aliens.\n\n1:58:20.980 --> 1:58:25.980\n Yeah, so Jordan Peterson has a line that says,\n\n1:58:26.300 --> 1:58:29.180\n you know, you think you have ideas, but ideas have you.\n\n1:58:29.180 --> 1:58:30.620\n Yeah, good line.\n\n1:58:30.620 --> 1:58:34.220\n Which, and then we know about the phenomenon of groupthink\n\n1:58:34.220 --> 1:58:37.940\n and there's so many things that constrain us.\n\n1:58:37.940 --> 1:58:39.920\n But I think you can examine all that\n\n1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:43.300\n and not be completely owned by the ideas\n\n1:58:43.300 --> 1:58:46.120\n and completely sucked into groupthink.\n\n1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:48.940\n And part of your responsibility as a human\n\n1:58:49.820 --> 1:58:51.740\n is to escape that kind of phenomenon,\n\n1:58:51.740 --> 1:58:55.940\n which isn't, it's one of the creative tension things again,\n\n1:58:55.940 --> 1:58:59.500\n you're constructed by it, but you can still observe it\n\n1:58:59.500 --> 1:59:01.820\n and you can think about it and you can make choices\n\n1:59:01.820 --> 1:59:05.660\n about to some level, how constrained you are by it.\n\n1:59:06.940 --> 1:59:09.780\n And it's useful to do that.\n\n1:59:09.780 --> 1:59:14.780\n And, but at the same time, and it could be by doing that,\n\n1:59:17.380 --> 1:59:21.460\n you know, the group and society you're part of\n\n1:59:21.460 --> 1:59:24.140\n becomes collectively even more interesting.\n\n1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:27.020\n So, you know, so the outside observer will think,\n\n1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:30.060\n wow, you know, all these Lexus running around\n\n1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:31.540\n with all these really independent ideas\n\n1:59:31.540 --> 1:59:33.700\n have created something even more interesting\n\n1:59:33.700 --> 1:59:35.700\n in the aggregate.\n\n1:59:35.700 --> 1:59:40.700\n So, I don't know, those are lenses to look at the situation\n\n1:59:41.860 --> 1:59:43.500\n that'll give you some inspiration,\n\n1:59:43.500 --> 1:59:45.460\n but I don't think they're constrained.\n\n1:59:45.460 --> 1:59:46.660\n Right.\n\n1:59:46.660 --> 1:59:49.340\n As a small little quirk of history,\n\n1:59:49.340 --> 1:59:53.540\n it seems like you're related to Jordan Peterson,\n\n1:59:53.540 --> 1:59:54.740\n like you mentioned.\n\n1:59:54.740 --> 1:59:57.620\n He's going through some rough stuff now.\n\n1:59:57.620 --> 1:59:59.180\n Is there some comment you can make\n\n1:59:59.180 --> 2:00:04.180\n about the roughness of the human journey, the ups and downs?\n\n2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:09.180\n Well, I became an expert in Benza withdrawal,\n\n2:00:10.700 --> 2:00:13.540\n like, which is, you took Benza to Aspen's,\n\n2:00:13.540 --> 2:00:18.540\n and at some point they interact with GABA circuits,\n\n2:00:18.940 --> 2:00:21.860\n you know, to reduce anxiety and do a hundred other things.\n\n2:00:21.860 --> 2:00:25.100\n Like there's actually no known list of everything they do\n\n2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:28.180\n because they interact with so many parts of your body.\n\n2:00:28.180 --> 2:00:30.460\n And then once you're on them, you habituate to them\n\n2:00:30.460 --> 2:00:32.580\n and you have a dependency.\n\n2:00:32.580 --> 2:00:34.180\n It's not like you're a drug dependency\n\n2:00:34.180 --> 2:00:35.020\n where you're trying to get high.\n\n2:00:35.020 --> 2:00:38.820\n It's a metabolic dependency.\n\n2:00:38.820 --> 2:00:41.020\n And then if you discontinue them,\n\n2:00:42.580 --> 2:00:44.420\n there's a funny thing called kindling,\n\n2:00:45.340 --> 2:00:47.540\n which is if you stop them and then go,\n\n2:00:47.540 --> 2:00:49.900\n you know, you'll have a horrible withdrawal symptoms.\n\n2:00:49.900 --> 2:00:51.460\n And if you go back on them at the same level,\n\n2:00:51.460 --> 2:00:53.260\n you won't be stable.\n\n2:00:53.260 --> 2:00:55.820\n And that unfortunately happened to him.\n\n2:00:55.820 --> 2:00:57.140\n Because it's so deeply integrated\n\n2:00:57.140 --> 2:00:58.860\n into all the kinds of systems in the body.\n\n2:00:58.860 --> 2:01:00.780\n It literally changes the size and numbers\n\n2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:03.820\n of neurotransmitter sites in your brain.\n\n2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:07.340\n So there's a process called the Ashton protocol\n\n2:01:07.340 --> 2:01:10.300\n where you taper it down slowly over two years\n\n2:01:10.300 --> 2:01:13.660\n to people go through that goes through unbelievable hell.\n\n2:01:13.660 --> 2:01:15.620\n And what Jordan went through seemed to be worse\n\n2:01:15.620 --> 2:01:18.460\n because on advice of doctors, you know,\n\n2:01:18.460 --> 2:01:20.260\n we'll stop taking these and take this.\n\n2:01:20.260 --> 2:01:21.340\n It was the disaster.\n\n2:01:21.340 --> 2:01:24.860\n And he got some, yeah, it was pretty tough.\n\n2:01:26.620 --> 2:01:29.180\n He seems to be doing quite a bit better intellectually.\n\n2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:32.020\n You can see his brain clicking back together.\n\n2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:32.940\n I spent a lot of time with him.\n\n2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:34.940\n I've never seen anybody suffer so much.\n\n2:01:34.940 --> 2:01:37.740\n Well, his brain is also like this powerhouse, right?\n\n2:01:37.740 --> 2:01:42.500\n So I wonder, does a brain that's able to think deeply\n\n2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:44.740\n about the world suffer more through these kinds\n\n2:01:44.740 --> 2:01:46.220\n of withdrawals, like?\n\n2:01:46.220 --> 2:01:47.060\n I don't know.\n\n2:01:47.060 --> 2:01:49.260\n I've watched videos of people going through withdrawal.\n\n2:01:49.260 --> 2:01:52.700\n They all seem to suffer unbelievably.\n\n2:01:54.060 --> 2:01:57.580\n And, you know, my heart goes out to everybody.\n\n2:01:57.580 --> 2:01:59.300\n And there's some funny math about this.\n\n2:01:59.300 --> 2:02:01.980\n Some doctor said, as best he can tell, you know,\n\n2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:03.620\n there's the standard recommendations.\n\n2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:04.820\n Don't take them for more than a month\n\n2:02:04.820 --> 2:02:07.220\n and then taper over a couple of weeks.\n\n2:02:07.220 --> 2:02:09.380\n Many doctors prescribe them endlessly,\n\n2:02:09.380 --> 2:02:13.180\n which is against the protocol, but it's common, right?\n\n2:02:13.180 --> 2:02:17.500\n And then something like 75% of people, when they taper,\n\n2:02:17.500 --> 2:02:19.900\n it's, you know, half the people have difficulty,\n\n2:02:19.900 --> 2:02:22.140\n but 75% get off okay.\n\n2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:24.020\n 20% have severe difficulty\n\n2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:27.300\n and 5% have life threatening difficulty.\n\n2:02:27.300 --> 2:02:29.580\n And if you're one of those, it's really bad.\n\n2:02:29.580 --> 2:02:31.580\n And the stories that people have on this\n\n2:02:31.580 --> 2:02:34.980\n is heartbreaking and tough.\n\n2:02:34.980 --> 2:02:36.860\n So you put some of the fault at the doctors.\n\n2:02:36.860 --> 2:02:38.660\n They just not know what the hell they're doing.\n\n2:02:38.660 --> 2:02:40.580\n No, no, it's hard to say.\n\n2:02:40.580 --> 2:02:43.140\n It's one of those commonly prescribed things.\n\n2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:46.140\n Like one doctor said, what happens is,\n\n2:02:46.140 --> 2:02:47.820\n if you're prescribed them for a reason\n\n2:02:47.820 --> 2:02:49.900\n and then you have a hard time getting off,\n\n2:02:49.900 --> 2:02:52.420\n the protocol basically says you're either crazy\n\n2:02:52.420 --> 2:02:55.500\n or dependent and you get kind of pushed\n\n2:02:55.500 --> 2:02:58.380\n into a different treatment regime.\n\n2:02:58.380 --> 2:03:01.820\n You're a drug addict or a psychiatric patient.\n\n2:03:01.820 --> 2:03:04.100\n And so like one doctor said, you know,\n\n2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:05.500\n I prescribed them for 10 years thinking\n\n2:03:05.500 --> 2:03:06.580\n I was helping my patients\n\n2:03:06.580 --> 2:03:08.620\n and I realized I was really harming them.\n\n2:03:09.620 --> 2:03:12.860\n And you know, the awareness of that is slowly coming up.\n\n2:03:14.420 --> 2:03:18.180\n The fact that they're casually prescribed to people\n\n2:03:18.180 --> 2:03:22.260\n is horrible and it's bloody scary.\n\n2:03:23.780 --> 2:03:25.020\n And some people are stable on them,\n\n2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:26.260\n but they're on them for life.\n\n2:03:26.260 --> 2:03:29.260\n Like once you, you know, it's another one of those drugs.\n\n2:03:29.260 --> 2:03:32.540\n But benzos long range have real impacts on your personality.\n\n2:03:32.540 --> 2:03:34.140\n People talk about the benzo bubble\n\n2:03:34.140 --> 2:03:36.300\n where you get disassociated from reality\n\n2:03:36.300 --> 2:03:38.180\n and your friends a little bit.\n\n2:03:38.180 --> 2:03:40.340\n It's really terrible.\n\n2:03:40.340 --> 2:03:41.700\n The mind is terrifying.\n\n2:03:41.700 --> 2:03:45.460\n We were talking about how the infinite possibility of fun,\n\n2:03:45.460 --> 2:03:48.660\n but like it's the infinite possibility of suffering too,\n\n2:03:48.660 --> 2:03:52.340\n which is one of the dangers of like expansion\n\n2:03:52.340 --> 2:03:53.500\n of the human mind.\n\n2:03:53.500 --> 2:03:58.260\n It's like, I wonder if all the possible experiences\n\n2:03:58.260 --> 2:04:01.740\n that an intelligent computer can have,\n\n2:04:01.740 --> 2:04:05.860\n is it mostly fun or is it mostly suffering?\n\n2:04:05.860 --> 2:04:10.860\n So like if you brute force expand the set of possibilities,\n\n2:04:11.380 --> 2:04:13.980\n like are you going to run into some trouble\n\n2:04:13.980 --> 2:04:16.580\n in terms of like torture and suffering and so on?\n\n2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:18.900\n Maybe our human brain is just protecting us\n\n2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:22.300\n from much more possible pain and suffering.\n\n2:04:22.300 --> 2:04:25.980\n Maybe the space of pain is like much larger\n\n2:04:25.980 --> 2:04:27.540\n than we could possibly imagine.\n\n2:04:27.540 --> 2:04:28.380\n And that.\n\n2:04:28.380 --> 2:04:29.580\n The world's in a balance.\n\n2:04:30.780 --> 2:04:34.260\n You know, all the literature on religion and stuff is,\n\n2:04:34.260 --> 2:04:36.340\n you know, the struggle between good and evil\n\n2:04:36.340 --> 2:04:39.420\n is balanced for very finely tuned\n\n2:04:39.420 --> 2:04:41.660\n for reasons that are complicated.\n\n2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:44.900\n But that's a long philosophical conversation.\n\n2:04:44.900 --> 2:04:46.700\n Speaking of balance that's complicated,\n\n2:04:46.700 --> 2:04:48.460\n I wonder because we're living through\n\n2:04:48.460 --> 2:04:51.620\n one of the more important moments in human history\n\n2:04:51.620 --> 2:04:53.780\n with this particular virus.\n\n2:04:53.780 --> 2:04:56.980\n It seems like pandemics have at least the ability\n\n2:04:56.980 --> 2:05:01.980\n to kill off most of the human population at their worst.\n\n2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:04.300\n And there's just fascinating\n\n2:05:04.300 --> 2:05:06.180\n because there's so many viruses in this world.\n\n2:05:06.180 --> 2:05:08.620\n There's so many, I mean, viruses basically run the world\n\n2:05:08.620 --> 2:05:12.260\n in the sense that they've been around very long time.\n\n2:05:12.260 --> 2:05:13.700\n They're everywhere.\n\n2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:15.340\n They seem to be extremely powerful\n\n2:05:15.340 --> 2:05:17.300\n in the distributed kind of way.\n\n2:05:17.300 --> 2:05:19.620\n But at the same time, they're not intelligent\n\n2:05:19.620 --> 2:05:21.260\n and they're not even living.\n\n2:05:21.260 --> 2:05:23.820\n Do you have like high level thoughts about this virus\n\n2:05:23.820 --> 2:05:28.260\n that like in terms of you being fascinated or terrified\n\n2:05:28.260 --> 2:05:30.420\n or somewhere in between?\n\n2:05:30.420 --> 2:05:32.500\n So I believe in frameworks, right?\n\n2:05:32.500 --> 2:05:35.420\n So like one of them is evolution.\n\n2:05:36.300 --> 2:05:37.900\n Like we're evolved creatures, right?\n\n2:05:37.900 --> 2:05:38.980\n Yes.\n\n2:05:38.980 --> 2:05:40.900\n And one of the things about evolution\n\n2:05:40.900 --> 2:05:42.740\n is it's hyper competitive.\n\n2:05:42.740 --> 2:05:44.900\n And it's not competitive out of a sense of evil.\n\n2:05:44.900 --> 2:05:47.820\n It's competitive as a sense of there's endless variation\n\n2:05:47.820 --> 2:05:50.380\n and variations that work better when.\n\n2:05:50.380 --> 2:05:52.980\n And then over time, there's so many levels\n\n2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:54.140\n of that competition.\n\n2:05:55.260 --> 2:05:57.740\n Like multicellular life partly exists\n\n2:05:57.740 --> 2:06:01.140\n because of the competition\n\n2:06:01.140 --> 2:06:04.260\n between different kinds of life forms.\n\n2:06:04.260 --> 2:06:06.900\n And we know sex partly exists to scramble our genes\n\n2:06:06.900 --> 2:06:09.900\n so that we have genetic variation\n\n2:06:09.900 --> 2:06:14.220\n against the invasion of the bacteria and the viruses.\n\n2:06:14.220 --> 2:06:16.020\n And it's endless.\n\n2:06:16.020 --> 2:06:18.020\n Like I read some funny statistic,\n\n2:06:18.020 --> 2:06:20.780\n like the density of viruses and bacteria in the ocean\n\n2:06:20.780 --> 2:06:22.020\n is really high.\n\n2:06:22.020 --> 2:06:23.900\n And one third of the bacteria die every day\n\n2:06:23.900 --> 2:06:26.220\n because a virus is invading them.\n\n2:06:26.220 --> 2:06:27.940\n Like one third of them.\n\n2:06:27.940 --> 2:06:29.020\n Wow.\n\n2:06:29.020 --> 2:06:31.020\n Like I don't know if that number is true,\n\n2:06:31.020 --> 2:06:34.900\n but it was like the amount of competition\n\n2:06:34.900 --> 2:06:36.460\n and what's going on is stunning.\n\n2:06:37.380 --> 2:06:38.660\n And there's a theory as we age,\n\n2:06:38.660 --> 2:06:41.780\n we slowly accumulate bacterias and viruses\n\n2:06:41.780 --> 2:06:45.620\n and as our immune system kind of goes down,\n\n2:06:45.620 --> 2:06:47.740\n that's what slowly kills us.\n\n2:06:47.740 --> 2:06:50.220\n It just feels so peaceful from a human perspective\n\n2:06:50.220 --> 2:06:51.420\n when we sit back and are able\n\n2:06:51.420 --> 2:06:53.180\n to have a relaxed conversation.\n\n2:06:54.220 --> 2:06:56.780\n And there's wars going on out there.\n\n2:06:56.780 --> 2:07:00.900\n Like right now, you're harboring how many bacteria?\n\n2:07:00.900 --> 2:07:04.860\n And the ones, many of them are parasites on you\n\n2:07:04.860 --> 2:07:06.060\n and some of them are helpful\n\n2:07:06.060 --> 2:07:07.780\n and some of them are modifying your behavior\n\n2:07:07.780 --> 2:07:12.220\n and some of them are, it's just really wild.\n\n2:07:12.220 --> 2:07:16.460\n But this particular manifestation is unusual\n\n2:07:16.460 --> 2:07:18.420\n in the demographic, how it hit\n\n2:07:18.420 --> 2:07:21.380\n and the political response that it engendered\n\n2:07:21.380 --> 2:07:23.860\n and the healthcare response it engendered\n\n2:07:23.860 --> 2:07:27.100\n and the technology it engendered, it's kind of wild.\n\n2:07:27.100 --> 2:07:30.500\n Yeah, the communication on Twitter that it led to,\n\n2:07:30.500 --> 2:07:32.980\n all that kind of stuff, at every single level, yeah.\n\n2:07:32.980 --> 2:07:34.620\n But what usually kills life,\n\n2:07:34.620 --> 2:07:39.460\n the big extinctions are caused by meteors and volcanoes.\n\n2:07:39.460 --> 2:07:40.820\n That's the one you're worried about\n\n2:07:40.820 --> 2:07:44.500\n as opposed to human created bombs that we launch.\n\n2:07:44.500 --> 2:07:46.100\n Solar flares are another good one.\n\n2:07:46.100 --> 2:07:48.580\n Occasionally, solar flares hit the planet.\n\n2:07:48.580 --> 2:07:49.540\n So it's nature.\n\n2:07:51.100 --> 2:07:52.700\n Yeah, it's all pretty wild.\n\n2:07:53.540 --> 2:07:57.500\n On another historic moment, this is perhaps outside\n\n2:07:57.500 --> 2:08:02.460\n but perhaps within your space of frameworks\n\n2:08:02.460 --> 2:08:04.540\n that you think about that just happened,\n\n2:08:04.540 --> 2:08:06.620\n I guess a couple of weeks ago is,\n\n2:08:06.620 --> 2:08:08.020\n I don't know if you're paying attention at all,\n\n2:08:08.020 --> 2:08:12.540\n is the GameStop and Wall Street bets.\n\n2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:14.100\n It's super fun.\n\n2:08:14.100 --> 2:08:16.580\n So it's really fascinating.\n\n2:08:16.580 --> 2:08:19.180\n There's kind of a theme to this conversation today\n\n2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:20.780\n because it's like neural networks,\n\n2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:25.020\n it's cool how there's a large number of people\n\n2:08:25.020 --> 2:08:30.020\n in a distributed way, almost having a kind of fun,\n\n2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:33.340\n we're able to take on the powerful elites,\n\n2:08:34.620 --> 2:08:39.060\n elite hedge funds, centralized powers and overpower them.\n\n2:08:39.980 --> 2:08:43.340\n Do you have thoughts on this whole saga?\n\n2:08:43.340 --> 2:08:45.020\n I don't know enough about finance,\n\n2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:49.260\n but it was like the Elon, Robinhood guy when they talked.\n\n2:08:49.260 --> 2:08:51.580\n Yeah, what'd you think about that?\n\n2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:52.660\n Well, Robinhood guy didn't know\n\n2:08:52.660 --> 2:08:54.300\n how the finance system worked.\n\n2:08:54.300 --> 2:08:55.540\n That was clear, right?\n\n2:08:55.540 --> 2:08:57.340\n He was treating like the people\n\n2:08:57.340 --> 2:09:00.020\n who settled the transactions as a black box.\n\n2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:01.620\n And suddenly somebody called him up and say,\n\n2:09:01.620 --> 2:09:04.740\n hey, black box calling you, your transaction volume\n\n2:09:04.740 --> 2:09:06.940\n means you need to put out $3 billion right now.\n\n2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:08.940\n And he's like, I don't have $3 billion.\n\n2:09:08.940 --> 2:09:10.540\n Like I don't even make any money on these trades.\n\n2:09:10.540 --> 2:09:13.220\n Why do I owe $3 billion while you're sponsoring the trade?\n\n2:09:13.220 --> 2:09:15.620\n So there was a set of abstractions\n\n2:09:15.620 --> 2:09:19.540\n that I don't think either, like now we understand it.\n\n2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:21.100\n Like this happens in chip design.\n\n2:09:21.100 --> 2:09:25.660\n Like you buy wafers from TSMC or Samsung or Intel,\n\n2:09:25.660 --> 2:09:27.460\n and they say it works like this\n\n2:09:27.460 --> 2:09:29.020\n and you do your design based on that.\n\n2:09:29.020 --> 2:09:31.260\n And then chip comes back and doesn't work.\n\n2:09:31.260 --> 2:09:34.260\n And then suddenly you started having to open the black boxes.\n\n2:09:34.260 --> 2:09:36.380\n The transistors really work like they said,\n\n2:09:36.380 --> 2:09:37.620\n what's the real issue?\n\n2:09:37.620 --> 2:09:42.620\n So there's a whole set of things\n\n2:09:43.260 --> 2:09:46.220\n that created this opportunity and somebody spotted it.\n\n2:09:46.220 --> 2:09:49.900\n Now, people spot these kinds of opportunities all the time.\n\n2:09:49.900 --> 2:09:51.380\n So there's been flash crashes,\n\n2:09:51.380 --> 2:09:55.340\n there's always short squeezes are fairly regular.\n\n2:09:55.340 --> 2:09:58.500\n Every CEO I know hates the shorts\n\n2:09:58.500 --> 2:10:01.860\n because they're trying to manipulate their stock\n\n2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:03.860\n in a way that they make money\n\n2:10:03.860 --> 2:10:07.420\n and deprive value from both the company\n\n2:10:07.420 --> 2:10:08.900\n and the investors.\n\n2:10:08.900 --> 2:10:13.700\n So the fact that some of these stocks were so short,\n\n2:10:13.700 --> 2:10:17.340\n it's hilarious that this hasn't happened before.\n\n2:10:17.340 --> 2:10:19.900\n I don't know why, and I don't actually know why\n\n2:10:19.900 --> 2:10:23.460\n some serious hedge funds didn't do it to other hedge funds.\n\n2:10:23.460 --> 2:10:24.380\n And some of the hedge funds\n\n2:10:24.380 --> 2:10:26.580\n actually made a lot of money on this.\n\n2:10:26.580 --> 2:10:31.580\n So my guess is we know 5% of what really happened\n\n2:10:32.140 --> 2:10:34.420\n and that a lot of the players don't know what happened.\n\n2:10:34.420 --> 2:10:37.420\n And the people who probably made the most money\n\n2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:39.500\n aren't the people that they're talking about.\n\n2:10:39.500 --> 2:10:41.060\n That's.\n\n2:10:41.060 --> 2:10:42.660\n Do you think there was something,\n\n2:10:42.660 --> 2:10:46.700\n I mean, this is the cool kind of Elon,\n\n2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:50.660\n you're the same kind of conversationalist,\n\n2:10:50.660 --> 2:10:53.860\n which is like first principles questions of like,\n\n2:10:53.860 --> 2:10:56.260\n what the hell happened?\n\n2:10:56.260 --> 2:10:57.900\n Just very basic questions of like,\n\n2:10:57.900 --> 2:10:59.860\n was there something shady going on?\n\n2:11:00.780 --> 2:11:03.660\n What, who are the parties involved?\n\n2:11:03.660 --> 2:11:06.340\n It's the basic questions everybody wants to know about.\n\n2:11:06.340 --> 2:11:10.340\n Yeah, so like we're in a very hyper competitive world,\n\n2:11:10.340 --> 2:11:12.180\n but transactions like buying and selling stock\n\n2:11:12.180 --> 2:11:13.780\n is a trust event.\n\n2:11:13.780 --> 2:11:16.980\n I trust the company, represented themselves properly.\n\n2:11:16.980 --> 2:11:19.660\n I bought the stock because I think it's gonna go up.\n\n2:11:19.660 --> 2:11:22.660\n I trust that the regulations are solid.\n\n2:11:22.660 --> 2:11:26.140\n Now, inside of that, there's all kinds of places\n\n2:11:26.140 --> 2:11:31.140\n where humans over trust and this exposed,\n\n2:11:31.140 --> 2:11:34.580\n let's say some weak points in the system.\n\n2:11:34.580 --> 2:11:37.340\n I don't know if it's gonna get corrected.\n\n2:11:37.340 --> 2:11:40.860\n I don't know if we have close to the real story.\n\n2:11:41.740 --> 2:11:44.460\n Yeah, my suspicion is we don't.\n\n2:11:44.460 --> 2:11:47.300\n And listen to that guy, he was like a little wide eyed\n\n2:11:47.300 --> 2:11:49.060\n about and then he did this and then he did that.\n\n2:11:49.060 --> 2:11:51.820\n And I was like, I think you should know more\n\n2:11:51.820 --> 2:11:54.180\n about your business than that.\n\n2:11:54.180 --> 2:11:56.140\n But again, there's many businesses\n\n2:11:56.140 --> 2:11:58.780\n when like this layer is really stable,\n\n2:11:58.780 --> 2:12:00.700\n you stop paying attention to it.\n\n2:12:00.700 --> 2:12:04.500\n You pay attention to the stuff that's bugging you or new.\n\n2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:05.780\n You don't pay attention to the stuff\n\n2:12:05.780 --> 2:12:07.060\n that just seems to work all the time.\n\n2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:11.100\n You just, sky's blue every day, California.\n\n2:12:11.100 --> 2:12:12.740\n And every once in a while it rains\n\n2:12:12.740 --> 2:12:15.300\n and everybody's like, what do we do?\n\n2:12:15.300 --> 2:12:17.940\n Somebody go bring in the lawn furniture.\n\n2:12:17.940 --> 2:12:18.780\n It's getting wet.\n\n2:12:18.780 --> 2:12:19.980\n You don't know why it's getting wet.\n\n2:12:19.980 --> 2:12:20.820\n Yeah, it doesn't always work.\n\n2:12:20.820 --> 2:12:24.580\n I was blue for like a hundred days and now it's, so.\n\n2:12:24.580 --> 2:12:27.020\n But part of the problem here with Vlad,\n\n2:12:27.020 --> 2:12:29.540\n the CEO of Robinhood is the scaling\n\n2:12:29.540 --> 2:12:32.540\n that we've been talking about is there's a lot\n\n2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:36.020\n of unexpected things that happen with the scaling\n\n2:12:36.020 --> 2:12:39.660\n and you have to be, I think the scaling forces you\n\n2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:41.780\n to then return to the fundamentals.\n\n2:12:41.780 --> 2:12:44.460\n Well, it's interesting because when you buy and sell stocks,\n\n2:12:44.460 --> 2:12:46.460\n the scaling is, the stocks don't only move\n\n2:12:46.460 --> 2:12:48.180\n in a certain range and if you buy a stock,\n\n2:12:48.180 --> 2:12:50.020\n you can only lose that amount of money.\n\n2:12:50.020 --> 2:12:52.420\n On the short market, you can lose a lot more\n\n2:12:52.420 --> 2:12:53.860\n than you can benefit.\n\n2:12:53.860 --> 2:12:57.220\n Like it has a weird cost function\n\n2:12:57.220 --> 2:12:59.260\n or whatever the right word for that is.\n\n2:12:59.260 --> 2:13:01.140\n So he was trading in a market\n\n2:13:01.140 --> 2:13:04.220\n where he wasn't actually capitalized for the downside.\n\n2:13:04.220 --> 2:13:06.260\n If it got outside a certain range.\n\n2:13:07.380 --> 2:13:09.780\n Now, whether something nefarious has happened,\n\n2:13:09.780 --> 2:13:12.580\n I have no idea, but at some point,\n\n2:13:12.580 --> 2:13:16.540\n the financial risk to both him and his customers\n\n2:13:16.540 --> 2:13:19.140\n was way outside of his financial capacity\n\n2:13:19.140 --> 2:13:23.380\n and his understanding how the system work was clearly weak\n\n2:13:23.380 --> 2:13:25.140\n or he didn't represent himself.\n\n2:13:25.140 --> 2:13:28.780\n I don't know the person and when I listened to him,\n\n2:13:28.780 --> 2:13:30.500\n it could have been the surprise question was like,\n\n2:13:30.500 --> 2:13:34.020\n and then these guys called and it sounded like\n\n2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:36.260\n he was treating stuff as a black box.\n\n2:13:36.260 --> 2:13:38.540\n Maybe he shouldn't have, but maybe he has a whole pile\n\n2:13:38.540 --> 2:13:40.060\n of experts somewhere else and it was going on.\n\n2:13:40.060 --> 2:13:41.220\n I don't know.\n\n2:13:41.220 --> 2:13:45.180\n Yeah, I mean, this is one of the qualities\n\n2:13:45.180 --> 2:13:49.060\n of a good leader is under fire, you have to perform.\n\n2:13:49.060 --> 2:13:53.020\n And that means to think clearly and to speak clearly.\n\n2:13:53.020 --> 2:13:55.260\n And he dropped the ball on those things\n\n2:13:55.260 --> 2:13:58.060\n because and understand the problem quickly,\n\n2:13:58.060 --> 2:14:03.060\n learn and understand the problem at this basic level.\n\n2:14:03.380 --> 2:14:05.100\n What the hell happened?\n\n2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:09.820\n And my guess is, at some level it was amateurs trading\n\n2:14:09.820 --> 2:14:12.940\n against experts slash insiders slash people\n\n2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:14.900\n with special information.\n\n2:14:14.900 --> 2:14:16.900\n Outsiders versus insiders.\n\n2:14:16.900 --> 2:14:20.700\n Yeah, and the insiders, my guess is the next time\n\n2:14:20.700 --> 2:14:22.980\n this happens, we'll make money on it.\n\n2:14:22.980 --> 2:14:25.100\n The insiders always win?\n\n2:14:25.100 --> 2:14:27.140\n Well, they have more tools and more incentive.\n\n2:14:27.140 --> 2:14:28.460\n I mean, this always happens.\n\n2:14:28.460 --> 2:14:30.820\n Like the outsiders are doing this for fun.\n\n2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:33.340\n The insiders are doing this 24 seven.\n\n2:14:33.340 --> 2:14:35.740\n But there's numbers in the outsiders.\n\n2:14:35.740 --> 2:14:37.540\n This is the interesting thing is it could be\n\n2:14:37.540 --> 2:14:38.380\n a new chapter. There's numbers\n\n2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:39.380\n on the insiders too.\n\n2:14:41.100 --> 2:14:44.020\n Different kind of numbers, yeah.\n\n2:14:44.020 --> 2:14:46.100\n But this could be a new era because, I don't know,\n\n2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:49.460\n at least I didn't expect that a bunch of Redditors could,\n\n2:14:49.460 --> 2:14:51.580\n there's millions of people who can get together.\n\n2:14:51.580 --> 2:14:52.420\n It was a surprise attack.\n\n2:14:52.420 --> 2:14:54.220\n The next one will be a surprise.\n\n2:14:54.220 --> 2:14:57.540\n But don't you think the crowd, the people are planning\n\n2:14:57.540 --> 2:14:59.260\n the next attack?\n\n2:14:59.260 --> 2:15:00.500\n We'll see.\n\n2:15:00.500 --> 2:15:01.420\n But it has to be a surprise.\n\n2:15:01.420 --> 2:15:02.700\n It can't be the same game.\n\n2:15:04.620 --> 2:15:05.460\n And so the insiders.\n\n2:15:05.460 --> 2:15:07.980\n It's like, it could be there's a very large number\n\n2:15:07.980 --> 2:15:10.540\n of games to play and they can be agile about it.\n\n2:15:10.540 --> 2:15:11.380\n I don't know.\n\n2:15:11.380 --> 2:15:12.220\n I'm not an expert.\n\n2:15:12.220 --> 2:15:13.780\n Right, that's a good question.\n\n2:15:13.780 --> 2:15:16.500\n The space of games, how restricted is it?\n\n2:15:18.020 --> 2:15:20.220\n Yeah, and the system is so complicated\n\n2:15:20.220 --> 2:15:22.740\n it could be relatively unrestricted.\n\n2:15:22.740 --> 2:15:26.260\n And also during the last couple of financial crashes,\n\n2:15:27.180 --> 2:15:30.180\n what set it off was sets of derivative events\n\n2:15:30.180 --> 2:15:35.180\n where Nassim Taleb's thing is they're trying\n\n2:15:35.980 --> 2:15:39.420\n to lower volatility in the short run\n\n2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:41.660\n by creating tail events.\n\n2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:43.700\n And the system's always evolved towards that\n\n2:15:43.700 --> 2:15:45.620\n and then they always crash.\n\n2:15:45.620 --> 2:15:50.620\n The S curve is the start low, ramp, plateau, crash.\n\n2:15:50.620 --> 2:15:53.020\n It's 100% effective.\n\n2:15:54.540 --> 2:15:55.860\n In the long run.\n\n2:15:55.860 --> 2:15:59.820\n Let me ask you some advice to put on your profound hat.\n\n2:16:01.660 --> 2:16:04.620\n There's a bunch of young folks who listen to this thing\n\n2:16:04.620 --> 2:16:07.460\n for no good reason whatsoever.\n\n2:16:07.460 --> 2:16:10.620\n Undergraduate students, maybe high school students,\n\n2:16:10.620 --> 2:16:13.020\n maybe just young folks, a young at heart\n\n2:16:13.020 --> 2:16:16.860\n looking for the next steps to take in life.\n\n2:16:16.860 --> 2:16:19.300\n What advice would you give to a young person today\n\n2:16:19.300 --> 2:16:23.860\n about life, maybe career, but also life in general?\n\n2:16:23.860 --> 2:16:25.100\n Get good at some stuff.\n\n2:16:26.100 --> 2:16:28.220\n Well, get to know yourself, right?\n\n2:16:28.220 --> 2:16:30.660\n Get good at something that you're actually interested in.\n\n2:16:30.660 --> 2:16:33.500\n You have to love what you're doing to get good at it.\n\n2:16:33.500 --> 2:16:34.420\n You really gotta find that.\n\n2:16:34.420 --> 2:16:35.800\n Don't waste all your time doing stuff\n\n2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:40.140\n that's just boring or bland or numbing, right?\n\n2:16:40.140 --> 2:16:42.380\n Don't let old people screw you.\n\n2:16:42.380 --> 2:16:46.740\n Well, people get talked into doing all kinds of shit\n\n2:16:46.740 --> 2:16:49.300\n and racking up huge student debts\n\n2:16:49.300 --> 2:16:52.580\n and there's so much crap going on.\n\n2:16:52.580 --> 2:16:54.700\n And then drains your time and drains your energy.\n\n2:16:54.700 --> 2:16:58.100\n The Eric Weinstein thesis that the older generation\n\n2:16:58.100 --> 2:17:01.100\n won't let go and they're trapping all the young people.\n\n2:17:01.100 --> 2:17:02.460\n Do you think there's some truth to that?\n\n2:17:02.460 --> 2:17:03.300\n Yeah, sure.\n\n2:17:04.940 --> 2:17:06.940\n Just because you're old doesn't mean you stop thinking.\n\n2:17:06.940 --> 2:17:10.380\n I know lots of really original old people.\n\n2:17:10.380 --> 2:17:11.300\n I'm an old person.\n\n2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:15.660\n But you have to be conscious about it.\n\n2:17:15.660 --> 2:17:18.940\n You can fall into the ruts and then do that.\n\n2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:22.060\n I mean, when I hear young people spouting opinions\n\n2:17:22.060 --> 2:17:24.380\n that sounds like they come from Fox News or CNN,\n\n2:17:24.380 --> 2:17:27.980\n I think they've been captured by groupthink and memes.\n\n2:17:27.980 --> 2:17:29.780\n They're supposed to think on their own.\n\n2:17:29.780 --> 2:17:31.420\n So if you find yourself repeating\n\n2:17:31.420 --> 2:17:33.420\n what everybody else is saying,\n\n2:17:33.420 --> 2:17:35.120\n you're not gonna have a good life.\n\n2:17:36.260 --> 2:17:38.460\n Like, that's not how the world works.\n\n2:17:38.460 --> 2:17:41.040\n It seems safe, but it puts you at great jeopardy\n\n2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:45.900\n for being boring or unhappy.\n\n2:17:45.900 --> 2:17:47.780\n How long did it take you to find the thing\n\n2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:50.620\n that you have fun with?\n\n2:17:50.620 --> 2:17:52.140\n Oh, I don't know.\n\n2:17:52.140 --> 2:17:54.300\n I've been a fun person since I was pretty little.\n\n2:17:54.300 --> 2:17:55.140\n So everything.\n\n2:17:55.140 --> 2:17:58.100\n I've gone through a couple periods of depression in my life.\n\n2:17:58.100 --> 2:18:00.180\n For a good reason or for a reason\n\n2:18:00.180 --> 2:18:02.620\n that doesn't make any sense?\n\n2:18:02.620 --> 2:18:05.980\n Yeah, like some things are hard.\n\n2:18:05.980 --> 2:18:08.900\n Like you go through mental transitions in high school.\n\n2:18:08.900 --> 2:18:10.700\n I was really depressed for a year\n\n2:18:10.700 --> 2:18:15.140\n and I think I had my first midlife crisis at 26.\n\n2:18:15.140 --> 2:18:16.660\n I kind of thought, is this all there is?\n\n2:18:16.660 --> 2:18:19.340\n Like I was working at a job that I loved,\n\n2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:23.420\n but I was going to work and all my time was consumed.\n\n2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:25.820\n What's the escape out of that depression?\n\n2:18:25.820 --> 2:18:29.220\n What's the answer to is this all there is?\n\n2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:31.820\n Well, a friend of mine, I asked him,\n\n2:18:31.820 --> 2:18:32.900\n because he was working his ass off,\n\n2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.540\n I said, what's your work life balance?\n\n2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:39.540\n Like there's work, friends, family, personal time.\n\n2:18:39.540 --> 2:18:41.380\n Are you balancing any of that?\n\n2:18:41.380 --> 2:18:43.580\n And he said, work 80%, family 20%.\n\n2:18:43.580 --> 2:18:47.540\n And I tried to find some time to sleep.\n\n2:18:47.540 --> 2:18:49.220\n Like there's no personal time.\n\n2:18:49.220 --> 2:18:51.820\n There's no passionate time.\n\n2:18:51.820 --> 2:18:54.580\n Like the young people are often passionate about work.\n\n2:18:54.580 --> 2:18:56.980\n So I was certainly like that.\n\n2:18:56.980 --> 2:18:59.940\n But you need to have some space in your life\n\n2:18:59.940 --> 2:19:01.820\n for different things.\n\n2:19:01.820 --> 2:19:05.860\n And that creates, that makes you resistant\n\n2:19:05.860 --> 2:19:10.860\n to the whole, the deep dips into depression kind of thing.\n\n2:19:11.260 --> 2:19:13.060\n Yeah, well, you have to get to know yourself too.\n\n2:19:13.060 --> 2:19:14.460\n Meditation helps.\n\n2:19:14.460 --> 2:19:18.540\n Some physical, something physically intense helps.\n\n2:19:18.540 --> 2:19:21.940\n Like the weird places your mind goes kind of thing.\n\n2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:23.780\n Like, and why does it happen?\n\n2:19:23.780 --> 2:19:24.860\n Why do you do what you do?\n\n2:19:24.860 --> 2:19:27.660\n Like triggers, like the things that cause your mind\n\n2:19:27.660 --> 2:19:29.460\n to go to different places kind of thing,\n\n2:19:29.460 --> 2:19:32.180\n or like events like.\n\n2:19:32.180 --> 2:19:33.740\n Your upbringing for better or worse,\n\n2:19:33.740 --> 2:19:35.700\n whether your parents are great people or not,\n\n2:19:35.700 --> 2:19:40.700\n you come into adulthood with all kinds of emotional burdens.\n\n2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:45.060\n And you can see some people are so bloody stiff\n\n2:19:45.060 --> 2:19:47.180\n and restrained, and they think the world's\n\n2:19:47.180 --> 2:19:50.660\n fundamentally negative, like you maybe.\n\n2:19:50.660 --> 2:19:53.020\n You have unexplored territory.\n\n2:19:53.020 --> 2:19:53.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:53.980 --> 2:19:56.300\n Or you're afraid of something.\n\n2:19:56.300 --> 2:19:58.780\n Definitely afraid of quite a few things.\n\n2:19:58.780 --> 2:20:00.180\n Then you gotta go face them.\n\n2:20:00.180 --> 2:20:03.460\n Like what's the worst thing that can happen?\n\n2:20:03.460 --> 2:20:05.180\n You're gonna die, right?\n\n2:20:05.180 --> 2:20:06.340\n Like that's inevitable.\n\n2:20:06.340 --> 2:20:07.380\n You might as well get over that.\n\n2:20:07.380 --> 2:20:08.860\n Like 100%, that's right.\n\n2:20:09.780 --> 2:20:11.060\n Like people are worried about the virus,\n\n2:20:11.060 --> 2:20:14.460\n but you know, the human condition is pretty deadly.\n\n2:20:14.460 --> 2:20:16.300\n There's something about embarrassment\n\n2:20:16.300 --> 2:20:18.220\n that's, I've competed a lot in my life,\n\n2:20:18.220 --> 2:20:21.980\n and I think the, if I'm to introspect it,\n\n2:20:21.980 --> 2:20:26.100\n the thing I'm most afraid of is being like humiliated,\n\n2:20:26.100 --> 2:20:26.940\n I think.\n\n2:20:26.940 --> 2:20:28.020\n Yeah, nobody cares about that.\n\n2:20:28.020 --> 2:20:29.980\n Like you're the only person on the planet\n\n2:20:29.980 --> 2:20:31.620\n that cares about you being humiliated.\n\n2:20:31.620 --> 2:20:32.460\n Exactly.\n\n2:20:32.460 --> 2:20:34.740\n It's like a really useless thought.\n\n2:20:34.740 --> 2:20:35.580\n It is.\n\n2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:39.540\n It's like, you're all humiliated.\n\n2:20:39.540 --> 2:20:41.140\n Something happened in a room full of people,\n\n2:20:41.140 --> 2:20:42.660\n and they walk out, and they didn't think about it\n\n2:20:42.660 --> 2:20:43.780\n one more second.\n\n2:20:43.780 --> 2:20:45.900\n Or maybe somebody told a funny story to somebody else.\n\n2:20:45.900 --> 2:20:48.580\n And then it dissipates it throughout, yeah.\n\n2:20:48.580 --> 2:20:49.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:49.420 --> 2:20:50.260\n No, I know it too.\n\n2:20:50.260 --> 2:20:53.340\n I mean, I've been really embarrassed about shit\n\n2:20:53.340 --> 2:20:55.500\n that nobody cared about myself.\n\n2:20:55.500 --> 2:20:56.340\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:56.340 --> 2:20:57.180\n It's a funny thing.\n\n2:20:57.180 --> 2:20:59.620\n So the worst thing ultimately is just.\n\n2:20:59.620 --> 2:21:01.020\n Yeah, but that's a cage,\n\n2:21:01.020 --> 2:21:02.060\n and then you have to get out of it.\n\n2:21:02.060 --> 2:21:02.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:02.900 --> 2:21:03.860\n Like once you, here's the thing.\n\n2:21:03.860 --> 2:21:05.740\n Once you find something like that,\n\n2:21:05.740 --> 2:21:08.160\n you have to be determined to break it.\n\n2:21:09.060 --> 2:21:10.260\n Because otherwise you'll just,\n\n2:21:10.260 --> 2:21:11.740\n so you accumulate that kind of junk,\n\n2:21:11.740 --> 2:21:15.420\n and then you die as a mess.\n\n2:21:15.420 --> 2:21:18.420\n So the goal, I guess it's like a cage within a cage.\n\n2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:21.980\n I guess the goal is to die in the biggest possible cage.\n\n2:21:21.980 --> 2:21:23.760\n Well, ideally you'd have no cage.\n\n2:21:25.460 --> 2:21:26.500\n People do get enlightened.\n\n2:21:26.500 --> 2:21:27.460\n I've met a few.\n\n2:21:27.460 --> 2:21:28.500\n It's great.\n\n2:21:28.500 --> 2:21:29.340\n You've found a few?\n\n2:21:29.340 --> 2:21:30.460\n There's a few out there?\n\n2:21:30.460 --> 2:21:31.280\n I don't know.\n\n2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:32.120\n Of course there are.\n\n2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:33.360\n I don't know.\n\n2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:35.520\n Either that or it's a great sales pitch.\n\n2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:37.080\n There's enlightened people writing books\n\n2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:38.280\n and doing all kinds of stuff.\n\n2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:39.520\n It's a good way to sell a book.\n\n2:21:39.520 --> 2:21:40.840\n I'll give you that.\n\n2:21:40.840 --> 2:21:42.880\n You've never met somebody you just thought,\n\n2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:43.840\n they just kill me.\n\n2:21:43.840 --> 2:21:47.880\n Like they just, like mental clarity, humor.\n\n2:21:47.880 --> 2:21:49.560\n No, 100%, but I just feel like\n\n2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:50.960\n they're living in a bigger cage.\n\n2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:52.040\n They have their own.\n\n2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:53.360\n You still think there's a cage?\n\n2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:54.400\n There's still a cage.\n\n2:21:54.400 --> 2:21:56.600\n You secretly suspect there's always a cage.\n\n2:21:57.560 --> 2:21:59.880\n There's nothing outside the universe.\n\n2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:02.280\n There's nothing outside the cage.\n\n2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:07.280\n You work in a bunch of companies,\n\n2:22:10.160 --> 2:22:12.640\n you lead a lot of amazing teams.\n\n2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:16.580\n I'm not sure if you've ever been\n\n2:22:16.580 --> 2:22:19.440\n like in the early stages of a startup,\n\n2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:22.760\n but do you have advice for somebody\n\n2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:28.320\n that wants to do a startup or build a company,\n\n2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:31.160\n like build a strong team of engineers that are passionate\n\n2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:35.000\n and just want to solve a big problem?\n\n2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:39.080\n Like, is there a more specifically on that point?\n\n2:22:39.080 --> 2:22:41.360\n Well, you have to be really good at stuff.\n\n2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:43.040\n If you're going to lead and build a team,\n\n2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:44.520\n you better be really interested\n\n2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:46.000\n in how people work and think.\n\n2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:49.040\n The people or the solution to the problem.\n\n2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:50.160\n So there's two things, right?\n\n2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:52.920\n One is how people work and the other is the...\n\n2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:55.640\n Well, actually there's quite a few successful startups.\n\n2:22:55.640 --> 2:22:56.800\n It's pretty clear the founders\n\n2:22:56.800 --> 2:22:58.360\n don't know anything about people.\n\n2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:01.480\n Like the idea was so powerful that it propelled them.\n\n2:23:01.480 --> 2:23:03.760\n But I suspect somewhere early,\n\n2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:06.980\n they hired some people who understood people\n\n2:23:06.980 --> 2:23:08.960\n because people really need a lot of care and feeding\n\n2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:10.480\n to collaborate and work together\n\n2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:12.760\n and feel engaged and work hard.\n\n2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:17.000\n Like startups are all about out producing other people.\n\n2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.820\n Like you're nimble because you don't have any legacy.\n\n2:23:19.820 --> 2:23:22.320\n You don't have a bunch of people\n\n2:23:22.320 --> 2:23:24.720\n who are depressed about life just showing up.\n\n2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:28.000\n So startups have a lot of advantages that way.\n\n2:23:29.720 --> 2:23:32.960\n Do you like the, Steve Jobs talked about this idea\n\n2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:34.940\n of A players and B players.\n\n2:23:34.940 --> 2:23:37.240\n I don't know if you know this formulation.\n\n2:23:37.240 --> 2:23:38.080\n Yeah, no.\n\n2:23:39.940 --> 2:23:43.400\n Organizations that get taken over by B player leaders\n\n2:23:44.680 --> 2:23:48.120\n often really underperform their C players.\n\n2:23:48.120 --> 2:23:50.720\n That said, in big organizations,\n\n2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:52.600\n there's so much work to do.\n\n2:23:52.600 --> 2:23:54.040\n And there's so many people who are happy\n\n2:23:54.040 --> 2:23:57.480\n to do what the leadership or the big idea people\n\n2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:00.320\n would consider menial jobs.\n\n2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:01.880\n And you need a place for them,\n\n2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:05.680\n but you need an organization that both values and rewards\n\n2:24:05.680 --> 2:24:08.460\n them but doesn't let them take over the leadership of it.\n\n2:24:08.460 --> 2:24:09.300\n Got it.\n\n2:24:09.300 --> 2:24:11.040\n So you need to have an organization\n\n2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:11.960\n that's resistant to that.\n\n2:24:11.960 --> 2:24:16.720\n But in the early days, the notion with Steve\n\n2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:20.680\n was that like one B player in a room of A players\n\n2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:23.040\n will be like destructive to the whole.\n\n2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:24.360\n I've seen that happen.\n\n2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:26.560\n I don't know if it's like always true.\n\n2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:30.320\n You run into people who are clearly B players\n\n2:24:30.320 --> 2:24:31.520\n but they think they're A players\n\n2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:33.200\n and so they have a loud voice at the table\n\n2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:35.160\n and they make lots of demands for that.\n\n2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:37.520\n But there's other people who are like, I know who I am.\n\n2:24:37.520 --> 2:24:39.720\n I just wanna work with cool people on cool shit\n\n2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:42.560\n and just tell me what to do and I'll go get it done.\n\n2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:45.840\n So you have to, again, this is like people skills.\n\n2:24:45.840 --> 2:24:47.960\n What kind of person is it?\n\n2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:51.040\n I've met some really great people I love working with\n\n2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:53.600\n that weren't the biggest ID people or the most productive\n\n2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:56.200\n ever but they show up, they get it done.\n\n2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:59.880\n They create connection and community that people value.\n\n2:24:59.880 --> 2:25:02.360\n It's pretty diverse so I don't think\n\n2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:03.660\n there's a recipe for that.\n\n2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:07.000\n I gotta ask you about love.\n\n2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:08.700\n I heard you're into this now.\n\n2:25:08.700 --> 2:25:09.560\n Into this love thing?\n\n2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:11.720\n Yeah, is this, do you think this is your solution\n\n2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:13.320\n to your depression?\n\n2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:14.880\n No, I'm just trying to, like you said,\n\n2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:16.960\n delighting people and occasionally trying to sell a book.\n\n2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:18.120\n I'm writing a book about love.\n\n2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:18.960\n You're writing a book about love?\n\n2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:21.080\n No, I'm not, I'm not.\n\n2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:25.080\n I have a friend of mine, he's gonna,\n\n2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:27.240\n he said you should really write a book\n\n2:25:27.240 --> 2:25:29.080\n about your management philosophy.\n\n2:25:29.080 --> 2:25:30.620\n He said it'd be a short book.\n\n2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.800\n Well, that one was thought pretty well.\n\n2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:40.440\n What role do you think love, family, friendship,\n\n2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:44.400\n all that kind of human stuff play in a successful life?\n\n2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:46.360\n You've been exceptionally successful in the space\n\n2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:51.160\n of running teams, building cool shit in this world,\n\n2:25:51.160 --> 2:25:53.160\n creating some amazing things.\n\n2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:54.720\n What, did love get in the way?\n\n2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:57.720\n Did love help the family get in the way?\n\n2:25:57.720 --> 2:25:59.760\n Did family help friendship?\n\n2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:02.120\n You want the engineer's answer?\n\n2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:03.120\n Please.\n\n2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:05.800\n But first, love is functional, right?\n\n2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:07.280\n It's functional in what way?\n\n2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:11.000\n So we habituate ourselves to the environment.\n\n2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:13.920\n And actually, Jordan Peterson told me this line.\n\n2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:16.440\n So you go through life and you just get used to everything,\n\n2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:17.800\n except for the things you love.\n\n2:26:17.800 --> 2:26:20.080\n They remain new.\n\n2:26:20.080 --> 2:26:22.440\n Like, this is really useful for, you know,\n\n2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:26.080\n like other people's children and dogs and trees.\n\n2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:27.700\n You just don't pay that much attention to them.\n\n2:26:27.700 --> 2:26:31.000\n Your own kids, you monitor them really closely.\n\n2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:32.720\n Like, and if they go off a little bit,\n\n2:26:32.720 --> 2:26:35.280\n because you love them, if you're smart,\n\n2:26:35.280 --> 2:26:37.480\n if you're gonna be a successful parent,\n\n2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:38.920\n you notice it right away.\n\n2:26:38.920 --> 2:26:43.920\n You don't habituate to just things you love.\n\n2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:46.160\n And if you want to be successful at work,\n\n2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:47.560\n if you don't love it,\n\n2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:50.400\n you're not gonna put the time in somebody else.\n\n2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:51.600\n It's somebody else that loves it.\n\n2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:53.760\n Like, because it's new and interesting,\n\n2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:56.060\n and that lets you go to the next level.\n\n2:26:57.560 --> 2:26:59.120\n So it's the thing, it's just a function\n\n2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:01.680\n that generates newness and novelty\n\n2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:04.680\n and surprises, you know, all those kinds of things.\n\n2:27:04.680 --> 2:27:06.360\n It's really interesting.\n\n2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:09.840\n There's people who figured out lots of frameworks for this.\n\n2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:11.600\n Like, humans seem to go,\n\n2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:13.880\n in partnership, go through interests.\n\n2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:16.640\n Like, suddenly somebody's interesting,\n\n2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:18.200\n and then you're infatuated with them,\n\n2:27:18.200 --> 2:27:20.080\n and then you're in love with them.\n\n2:27:20.080 --> 2:27:22.600\n And then you, you know, different people have ideas\n\n2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:24.520\n about parental love or mature love.\n\n2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:26.600\n Like, you go through a cycle of that,\n\n2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:27.840\n which keeps us together,\n\n2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:30.600\n and it's super functional for creating families\n\n2:27:30.600 --> 2:27:34.560\n and creating communities and making you support somebody\n\n2:27:34.560 --> 2:27:36.960\n despite the fact that you don't love them.\n\n2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:41.960\n Like, and it can be really enriching.\n\n2:27:44.260 --> 2:27:47.480\n You know, now, in the work life balance scheme,\n\n2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:49.760\n if alls you do is work,\n\n2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:52.320\n you think you may be optimizing your work potential,\n\n2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:53.840\n but if you don't love your work\n\n2:27:53.840 --> 2:27:56.960\n or you don't have family and friends\n\n2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:58.420\n and things you care about,\n\n2:27:59.280 --> 2:28:02.000\n your brain isn't well balanced.\n\n2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:03.440\n Like, everybody knows the experience of,\n\n2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:04.680\n he works on something all week.\n\n2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:07.720\n He went home, took two days off, and he came back in.\n\n2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.360\n The odds of you working on the thing,\n\n2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:12.760\n you picking up right where you left off is zero.\n\n2:28:12.760 --> 2:28:14.260\n Your brain refactored it.\n\n2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:19.200\n But being in love is great.\n\n2:28:19.200 --> 2:28:22.440\n It's like changes the color of the light in the room.\n\n2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:25.600\n It creates a spaciousness that's different.\n\n2:28:25.600 --> 2:28:26.680\n It helps you think.\n\n2:28:27.900 --> 2:28:29.560\n It makes you strong.\n\n2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:32.520\n Bukowski had this line about love being a fog\n\n2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:36.240\n that dissipates with the first light of reality\n\n2:28:36.240 --> 2:28:37.080\n in the morning.\n\n2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:38.000\n That's depressing.\n\n2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:39.560\n I think it's the other way around.\n\n2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:40.400\n It lasts.\n\n2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:42.100\n Well, like you said, it's a function.\n\n2:28:42.100 --> 2:28:42.940\n It's a thing that generates.\n\n2:28:42.940 --> 2:28:45.640\n It can be the light that actually enlivens your world\n\n2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:49.320\n and creates the interest and the power and the strength\n\n2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:50.500\n to go do something.\n\n2:28:51.720 --> 2:28:54.360\n Well, it's like, that sounds like,\n\n2:28:54.360 --> 2:28:56.200\n you know, there's like physical love, emotional love,\n\n2:28:56.200 --> 2:28:58.240\n intellectual love, spiritual love, right?\n\n2:28:58.240 --> 2:28:59.840\n Isn't it all the same thing, kind of?\n\n2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:01.080\n Nope.\n\n2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:02.160\n You should differentiate that.\n\n2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:04.040\n Maybe that's your problem.\n\n2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:06.080\n In your book, you should refine that a little bit.\n\n2:29:06.080 --> 2:29:07.280\n Is it different chapters?\n\n2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:08.560\n Yeah, there's different chapters.\n\n2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:11.600\n What's these, aren't these just different layers\n\n2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:14.360\n of the same thing, the stack of physical?\n\n2:29:14.360 --> 2:29:17.400\n People, some people are addicted to physical love\n\n2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:20.400\n and they have no idea about emotional or intellectual love.\n\n2:29:21.880 --> 2:29:22.960\n I don't know if they're the same things.\n\n2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:23.920\n I think they're different.\n\n2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:24.760\n That's true.\n\n2:29:24.760 --> 2:29:25.580\n They could be different.\n\n2:29:25.580 --> 2:29:28.200\n I guess the ultimate goal is for it to be the same.\n\n2:29:28.200 --> 2:29:30.200\n Well, if you want something to be bigger and interesting,\n\n2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:32.560\n you should find all its components and differentiate them,\n\n2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:34.520\n not clump it together.\n\n2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:36.360\n Like, people do this all the time.\n\n2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:38.120\n Yeah, the modularity.\n\n2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:39.440\n Get your abstraction layers right\n\n2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:41.600\n and then you have room to breathe.\n\n2:29:41.600 --> 2:29:43.480\n Well, maybe you can write the forward to my book\n\n2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:44.320\n about love.\n\n2:29:44.320 --> 2:29:45.960\n Or the afterwards.\n\n2:29:45.960 --> 2:29:46.800\n And the after.\n\n2:29:46.800 --> 2:29:47.740\n You really tried.\n\n2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:51.920\n I feel like Lex has made a lot of progress in this book.\n\n2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:55.880\n Well, you have things in your life that you love.\n\n2:29:55.880 --> 2:29:57.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:29:57.680 --> 2:29:59.800\n And they are, you're right, they're modular.\n\n2:29:59.800 --> 2:30:01.280\n It's quality.\n\n2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:04.560\n And you can have multiple things with the same person\n\n2:30:04.560 --> 2:30:06.320\n or the same thing.\n\n2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:08.520\n But, yeah.\n\n2:30:08.520 --> 2:30:09.720\n Depending on the moment of the day.\n\n2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:13.160\n Yeah, there's, like what Bukowski described\n\n2:30:13.160 --> 2:30:15.420\n is that moment when you go from being in love\n\n2:30:15.420 --> 2:30:17.320\n to having a different kind of love.\n\n2:30:17.320 --> 2:30:18.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:30:18.360 --> 2:30:19.480\n And that's a transition.\n\n2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:21.720\n But when it happens, if you read the owner's manual\n\n2:30:21.720 --> 2:30:23.620\n and you believed it, you would have said,\n\n2:30:23.620 --> 2:30:25.200\n oh, this happened.\n\n2:30:25.200 --> 2:30:26.460\n It doesn't mean it's not love.\n\n2:30:26.460 --> 2:30:27.920\n It's a different kind of love.\n\n2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:32.320\n But maybe there's something better about that.\n\n2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:36.760\n As you grow old, all you do is regret how you used to be.\n\n2:30:36.760 --> 2:30:37.600\n It's sad.\n\n2:30:38.560 --> 2:30:39.400\n Right?\n\n2:30:39.400 --> 2:30:40.720\n You should have learned a lot of things\n\n2:30:40.720 --> 2:30:43.280\n because like who you can be in your future self\n\n2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:46.720\n is actually more interesting and possibly delightful\n\n2:30:46.720 --> 2:30:51.720\n than being a mad kid in love with the next person.\n\n2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:54.440\n Like, that's super fun when it happens.\n\n2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:59.440\n But that's, you know, 5% of the possibility.\n\n2:30:59.840 --> 2:31:02.280\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:31:02.280 --> 2:31:05.320\n There's a lot more fun to be had in the long lasting stuff.\n\n2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:07.640\n Yeah, or meaning, you know, if that's your thing.\n\n2:31:07.640 --> 2:31:09.280\n Which is a kind of fun.\n\n2:31:09.280 --> 2:31:10.640\n It's a deeper kind of fun.\n\n2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:11.560\n And it's surprising.\n\n2:31:11.560 --> 2:31:14.960\n You know, that's, like the thing I like is surprises.\n\n2:31:15.920 --> 2:31:19.440\n You know, and you just never know what's gonna happen.\n\n2:31:19.440 --> 2:31:21.400\n But you have to look carefully and you have to work at it\n\n2:31:21.400 --> 2:31:24.000\n and you have to think about it and you know, it's.\n\n2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:26.480\n Yeah, you have to see the surprises when they happen, right?\n\n2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:28.320\n You have to be looking for it.\n\n2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:31.280\n From the branching perspective, you mentioned regrets.\n\n2:31:33.360 --> 2:31:36.200\n Do you have regrets about your own trajectory?\n\n2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:37.240\n Oh yeah, of course.\n\n2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:39.440\n Yeah, some of it's painful,\n\n2:31:39.440 --> 2:31:41.320\n but you wanna hear the painful stuff?\n\n2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:42.160\n No.\n\n2:31:42.160 --> 2:31:46.960\n I would say, like in terms of working with people,\n\n2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:48.760\n when people did stuff I didn't like,\n\n2:31:48.760 --> 2:31:50.760\n especially if it was a bit nefarious,\n\n2:31:50.760 --> 2:31:54.520\n I took it personally and I also felt it was personal\n\n2:31:54.520 --> 2:31:56.000\n about them.\n\n2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:57.760\n But a lot of times, like humans are,\n\n2:31:57.760 --> 2:31:59.840\n you know, most humans are a mess, right?\n\n2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:02.120\n And then they act out and they do stuff.\n\n2:32:02.120 --> 2:32:06.000\n And the psychologist I heard a long time ago said,\n\n2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:09.240\n you tend to think somebody does something to you.\n\n2:32:09.240 --> 2:32:10.880\n But really what they're doing is they're doing\n\n2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:13.360\n what they're doing while they're in front of you.\n\n2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:16.240\n It's not that much about you, right?\n\n2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:20.400\n And as I got more interested in,\n\n2:32:20.400 --> 2:32:21.720\n you know, when I work with people,\n\n2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:25.080\n I think about them and probably analyze them\n\n2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:26.600\n and understand them a little bit.\n\n2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:29.080\n And then when they do stuff, I'm way less surprised.\n\n2:32:29.080 --> 2:32:32.320\n And if it's bad, I'm way less hurt.\n\n2:32:32.320 --> 2:32:34.160\n And I react way less.\n\n2:32:34.160 --> 2:32:37.080\n Like I sort of expect everybody's got their shit.\n\n2:32:37.080 --> 2:32:38.920\n Yeah, and it's not about you as much.\n\n2:32:38.920 --> 2:32:41.000\n It's not about me that much.\n\n2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:42.760\n It's like, you know, you do something\n\n2:32:42.760 --> 2:32:45.280\n and you think you're embarrassed, but nobody cares.\n\n2:32:45.280 --> 2:32:46.920\n Like, and somebody's really mad at you,\n\n2:32:46.920 --> 2:32:49.680\n the odds of it being about you.\n\n2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:51.360\n No, they're getting mad the way they're doing that\n\n2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:53.160\n because of some pattern they learned.\n\n2:32:53.160 --> 2:32:55.560\n And you know, and maybe you can help them\n\n2:32:55.560 --> 2:32:56.840\n if you care enough about it.\n\n2:32:56.840 --> 2:33:00.560\n But, or you could see it coming and step out of the way.\n\n2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:02.860\n Like, I wish I was way better at that.\n\n2:33:02.860 --> 2:33:04.740\n I'm a bit of a hothead.\n\n2:33:04.740 --> 2:33:06.000\n And in support of that.\n\n2:33:06.000 --> 2:33:08.880\n You said with Steve, that was a feature, not a bug.\n\n2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:11.640\n Yeah, well, he was using it as the counter force\n\n2:33:11.640 --> 2:33:13.480\n to orderliness that would crush his work.\n\n2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:15.080\n Well, you were doing the same.\n\n2:33:15.080 --> 2:33:15.920\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n2:33:15.920 --> 2:33:18.960\n I don't think I, I don't think my vision was big enough.\n\n2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:22.560\n It was more like I just got pissed off and did stuff.\n\n2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:27.280\n I'm sure that's the, yeah, you're telling me.\n\n2:33:27.280 --> 2:33:29.080\n I don't know if it had the,\n\n2:33:29.080 --> 2:33:30.920\n it didn't have the amazing effect\n\n2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:32.440\n of creating the trillion dollar company.\n\n2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:35.320\n It was more like I just got pissed off and left\n\n2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:38.400\n and, or made enemies that I shouldn't have.\n\n2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:40.520\n And yeah, it's hard.\n\n2:33:40.520 --> 2:33:42.080\n Like, I didn't really understand politics\n\n2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:44.320\n until I worked at Apple where, you know,\n\n2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:46.120\n Steve was a master player of politics\n\n2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:48.840\n and his staff had to be, or they wouldn't survive him.\n\n2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:51.400\n And it was definitely part of the culture.\n\n2:33:51.400 --> 2:33:52.640\n And then I've been in companies where they say\n\n2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:54.880\n it's political, but it's all, you know,\n\n2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:56.920\n fun and games compared to Apple.\n\n2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:00.320\n And it's not that the people at Apple are bad people.\n\n2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:03.560\n It's just, they operate politically at a higher level.\n\n2:34:04.680 --> 2:34:06.920\n You know, it's not like, oh, somebody said something bad\n\n2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:10.840\n about somebody, somebody else, which is most politics.\n\n2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:13.520\n It's, you know, they had strategies\n\n2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:15.680\n about accomplishing their goals.\n\n2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:19.920\n Sometimes, you know, over the dead bodies of their enemies.\n\n2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:23.080\n You know, with sophistication, yeah,\n\n2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:25.440\n more Game of Thrones than sophistication\n\n2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:29.000\n and like a big time factor rather than a, you know.\n\n2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.280\n Wow, that requires a lot of control over your emotions,\n\n2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:35.600\n I think, to have a bigger strategy in the way you behave.\n\n2:34:35.600 --> 2:34:38.800\n Yeah, and it's effective in the sense\n\n2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:40.760\n that coordinating thousands of people\n\n2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:44.280\n to do really hard things where many of the people\n\n2:34:44.280 --> 2:34:45.920\n in there don't understand themselves,\n\n2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:47.960\n much less how they're participating,\n\n2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:52.600\n creates all kinds of, you know, drama and problems\n\n2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:55.800\n that, you know, our solution is political in nature.\n\n2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:57.040\n Like how do you convince people?\n\n2:34:57.040 --> 2:34:57.880\n How do you leverage them?\n\n2:34:57.880 --> 2:34:59.040\n How do you motivate them?\n\n2:34:59.040 --> 2:35:00.040\n How do you get rid of them?\n\n2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:02.400\n How do you, you know, like there's so many layers\n\n2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:04.440\n of that that are interesting.\n\n2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:08.480\n And even though some of it, let's say, may be tough,\n\n2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:13.480\n it's not evil unless, you know, you use that skill\n\n2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:16.240\n to evil purposes, which some people obviously do.\n\n2:35:16.240 --> 2:35:19.480\n But it's a skill set that operates, you know.\n\n2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:22.320\n And I wish I'd, you know, I was interested in it,\n\n2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:24.080\n but I, you know, it was sort of like,\n\n2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:25.720\n I'm an engineer, I do my thing.\n\n2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:28.360\n And, you know, there's times\n\n2:35:28.360 --> 2:35:30.320\n when I could have had a way bigger impact\n\n2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:33.160\n if I, you know, knew how to,\n\n2:35:33.160 --> 2:35:35.760\n if I paid more attention and knew more about that.\n\n2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:38.800\n Yeah, about the human layer of the stack.\n\n2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:41.560\n Yeah, that human political power, you know,\n\n2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:43.240\n expression layer of the stack.\n\n2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:44.720\n Just complicated.\n\n2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:45.960\n And there's lots to know about it.\n\n2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:48.360\n I mean, people are good at it, are just amazing.\n\n2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:50.480\n And when they're good at it,\n\n2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:55.360\n and let's say, relatively kind and oriented\n\n2:35:55.360 --> 2:35:58.640\n in a good direction, you can really feel,\n\n2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:00.520\n you can get lots of stuff done and coordinate things\n\n2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:02.120\n that you never thought possible.\n\n2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:06.680\n But all people like that also have some pretty hard edges\n\n2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:09.600\n because, you know, it's a heavy lift.\n\n2:36:09.600 --> 2:36:13.160\n And I wish I'd spent more time like that when I was younger.\n\n2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:14.120\n But maybe I wasn't ready.\n\n2:36:14.120 --> 2:36:16.480\n You know, I was a wide eyed kid for 30 years.\n\n2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:18.680\n Still a bit of a kid.\n\n2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:19.960\n Yeah, I know.\n\n2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:23.480\n What do you hope your legacy is\n\n2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:28.000\n when there's a book like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\n\n2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:31.120\n and this is like a one sentence entry by Jim Waller\n\n2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:34.200\n from like that guy lived at some point.\n\n2:36:34.200 --> 2:36:35.600\n There's not many, you know,\n\n2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:37.720\n not many people would be remembered.\n\n2:36:37.720 --> 2:36:42.360\n You're one of the sparkling little human creatures\n\n2:36:42.360 --> 2:36:44.760\n that had a big impact on the world.\n\n2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:46.360\n How do you hope you'll be remembered?\n\n2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:48.520\n My daughter was trying to get,\n\n2:36:48.520 --> 2:36:49.960\n she edited my Wikipedia page\n\n2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:52.360\n to say that I was a legend and a guru.\n\n2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:55.600\n But they took it out, so she put it back in.\n\n2:36:55.600 --> 2:36:56.520\n She's 15.\n\n2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:01.320\n I think that was probably the best part of my legacy.\n\n2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:04.560\n She got her sister, and they were all excited.\n\n2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:06.600\n They were like trying to put it in the references\n\n2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:09.360\n because there's articles and that on the title.\n\n2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:13.080\n So in the eyes of your kids, you're a legend.\n\n2:37:13.080 --> 2:37:14.320\n Well, they're pretty skeptical\n\n2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:15.960\n because they don't be better than that.\n\n2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:17.320\n They're like dad.\n\n2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:21.600\n So yeah, that kind of stuff is super fun.\n\n2:37:21.600 --> 2:37:24.360\n In terms of the big legends stuff, I don't care.\n\n2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:25.200\n You don't care.\n\n2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:26.680\n I don't really care.\n\n2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:28.560\n You're just an engineer.\n\n2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:31.080\n Yeah, I've been thinking about building a big pyramid.\n\n2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:33.560\n So I had a debate with a friend\n\n2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:36.840\n about whether pyramids or craters are cooler.\n\n2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:39.240\n And he realized that there's craters everywhere,\n\n2:37:39.240 --> 2:37:42.040\n but they built a couple of pyramids 5,000 years ago.\n\n2:37:42.040 --> 2:37:43.240\n And they remember you for a while.\n\n2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:45.080\n We're still talking about it.\n\n2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:47.280\n So I think that would be cool.\n\n2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:48.680\n Those aren't easy to build.\n\n2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:49.520\n Oh, I know.\n\n2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:51.960\n And they don't actually know how they built them,\n\n2:37:51.960 --> 2:37:52.880\n which is great.\n\n2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:58.480\n It's either AGI or aliens could be involved.\n\n2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:01.680\n So I think you're gonna have to figure out\n\n2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:03.640\n quite a few more things than just\n\n2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:05.400\n the basics of civil engineering.\n\n2:38:05.400 --> 2:38:09.120\n So I guess you hope your legacy is pyramids.\n\n2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.400\n That would be cool.\n\n2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:13.880\n And my Wikipedia page, you know,\n\n2:38:13.880 --> 2:38:16.240\n getting updated by my daughter periodically.\n\n2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:18.640\n Like those two things would pretty much make it.\n\n2:38:18.640 --> 2:38:20.600\n Jim, it's a huge honor talking to you again.\n\n2:38:20.600 --> 2:38:22.720\n I hope we talk many more times in the future.\n\n2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:26.160\n I can't wait to see what you do with Tense Torrent.\n\n2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:27.800\n I can't wait to use it.\n\n2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:30.040\n I can't wait for you to revolutionize\n\n2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:33.400\n yet another space in computing.\n\n2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:34.760\n It's a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:35.600\n Thanks for talking to me.\n\n2:38:35.600 --> 2:39:05.320\n This was fun.\n\n2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:06.600\n See you next time.\n\n"
