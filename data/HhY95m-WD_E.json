00:08.260\n with research interests in computer security.\n\n00:08.260 --> 00:10.960\n Most recently, with a focus on the intersection\n\n00:10.960 --> 00:13.880\n between security and machine learning.\n\n00:13.880 --> 00:15.160\n This conversation was recorded\n\n00:15.160 --> 00:17.160\n before the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n00:17.160 --> 00:19.560\n For everyone feeling the medical, psychological,\n\n00:19.560 --> 00:21.520\n and financial burden of this crisis,\n\n00:21.520 --> 00:23.120\n I'm sending love your way.\n\n00:23.120 --> 00:24.160\n Stay strong.\n\n00:24.160 --> 00:25.520\n We're in this together.\n\n00:25.520 --> 00:27.320\n We'll beat this thing.\n\n00:27.320 --> 00:29.640\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:29.640 --> 00:31.800\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:31.800 --> 00:34.120\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n00:34.120 --> 00:35.560\n support it on Patreon,\n\n00:35.560 --> 00:37.480\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n00:37.480 --> 00:41.340\n at lexfriedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n00:41.340 --> 00:43.760\n As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now\n\n00:43.760 --> 00:45.160\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n00:45.160 --> 00:47.840\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n00:47.840 --> 00:48.880\n I hope that works for you\n\n00:48.880 --> 00:51.760\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n00:51.760 --> 00:53.560\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n00:53.560 --> 00:55.800\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n00:55.800 --> 00:58.800\n When you get it, use code lexpodcast.\n\n00:58.800 --> 01:00.800\n Cash App lets you send money to friends,\n\n01:00.800 --> 01:02.880\n buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market\n\n01:02.880 --> 01:05.000\n with as little as one dollar.\n\n01:05.000 --> 01:07.400\n Since Cash App does fractional share trading,\n\n01:07.400 --> 01:10.160\n let me mention that the order execution algorithm\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:11.760\n that works behind the scenes\n\n01:11.760 --> 01:14.040\n to create the abstraction of fractional orders\n\n01:14.040 --> 01:16.280\n is an algorithmic marvel.\n\n01:16.280 --> 01:18.240\n So big props to the Cash App engineers\n\n01:18.240 --> 01:19.760\n for solving a hard problem\n\n01:19.760 --> 01:22.520\n that in the end provides an easy interface\n\n01:22.520 --> 01:25.080\n that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction\n\n01:25.080 --> 01:26.520\n over the stock market,\n\n01:26.520 --> 01:29.240\n making trading more accessible for new investors\n\n01:29.240 --> 01:32.240\n and diversification much easier.\n\n01:32.240 --> 01:35.400\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n01:35.400 --> 01:39.080\n and use the code lexpodcast, you get $10\n\n01:39.080 --> 01:42.040\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n01:42.040 --> 01:44.720\n an organization that is helping to advance robotics\n\n01:44.720 --> 01:47.800\n and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n01:48.680 --> 01:52.540\n And now here's my conversation with Dawn Song.\n\n01:53.520 --> 01:54.960\n Do you think software systems\n\n01:54.960 --> 01:57.200\n will always have security vulnerabilities?\n\n01:57.200 --> 02:00.600\n Let's start at the broad, almost philosophical level.\n\n02:00.600 --> 02:02.080\n That's a very good question.\n\n02:02.080 --> 02:03.040\n I mean, in general, right,\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:07.640\n it's very difficult to write completely bug free code\n\n02:07.640 --> 02:09.880\n and code that has no vulnerability.\n\n02:09.880 --> 02:12.040\n And also, especially given that the definition\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:14.240\n of vulnerability is actually really broad.\n\n02:14.240 --> 02:18.520\n It's any type of attacks essentially on a code can,\n\n02:18.520 --> 02:21.240\n you know, that's, you can call that,\n\n02:21.240 --> 02:22.760\n that caused by vulnerabilities.\n\n02:22.760 --> 02:25.520\n And the nature of attacks is always changing as well?\n\n02:25.520 --> 02:27.240\n Like new ones are coming up?\n\n02:27.240 --> 02:29.280\n Right, so for example, in the past,\n\n02:29.280 --> 02:32.840\n we talked about memory safety type of vulnerabilities\n\n02:32.840 --> 02:37.080\n where essentially attackers can exploit the software\n\n02:37.080 --> 02:40.520\n and take over control of how the code runs\n\n02:40.520 --> 02:42.120\n and then can launch attacks that way.\n\n02:42.120 --> 02:44.580\n By accessing some aspect of the memory\n\n02:44.580 --> 02:48.640\n and be able to then alter the state of the program?\n\n02:48.640 --> 02:51.960\n Exactly, so for example, in the example of a buffer overflow,\n\n02:51.960 --> 02:55.840\n then the attacker essentially actually causes\n\n02:56.720 --> 03:01.720\n essentially unintended changes in the state of the program.\n\n03:01.720 --> 03:03.120\n And then, for example,\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:05.680\n can then take over control flow of the program\n\n03:05.680 --> 03:08.760\n and let the program to execute codes\n\n03:08.760 --> 03:11.200\n that actually the programmer didn't intend.\n\n03:11.200 --> 03:12.960\n So the attack can be a remote attack.\n\n03:12.960 --> 03:14.880\n So the attacker, for example,\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:17.880\n can send in a malicious input to the program\n\n03:17.880 --> 03:20.800\n that just causes the program to completely\n\n03:20.800 --> 03:24.360\n then be compromised and then end up doing something\n\n03:24.360 --> 03:29.360\n that's under the attacker's control and intention.\n\n03:29.520 --> 03:31.240\n But that's just one form of attacks\n\n03:31.240 --> 03:32.680\n and there are other forms of attacks.\n\n03:32.680 --> 03:35.540\n Like for example, there are these side channels\n\n03:35.540 --> 03:39.860\n where attackers can try to learn from,\n\n03:39.860 --> 03:42.040\n even just observing the outputs\n\n03:42.040 --> 03:43.420\n from the behaviors of the program,\n\n03:43.420 --> 03:46.100\n try to infer certain secrets of the program.\n\n03:46.100 --> 03:49.200\n So essentially, right, the form of attacks\n\n03:49.200 --> 03:53.800\n is very, very, it's very broad spectrum.\n\n03:53.800 --> 03:56.560\n And in general, from the security perspective,\n\n03:56.560 --> 04:01.040\n we want to essentially provide as much guarantee\n\n04:01.040 --> 04:05.240\n as possible about the program's security properties\n\n04:05.240 --> 04:06.080\n and so on.\n\n04:06.080 --> 04:10.080\n So for example, we talked about providing provable guarantees\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:11.980\n of the program.\n\n04:11.980 --> 04:15.880\n So for example, there are ways we can use program analysis\n\n04:15.880 --> 04:17.920\n and formal verification techniques\n\n04:17.920 --> 04:19.720\n to prove that a piece of code\n\n04:19.720 --> 04:23.880\n has no memory safety vulnerabilities.\n\n04:24.740 --> 04:25.580\n What does that look like?\n\n04:25.580 --> 04:26.420\n What is that proof?\n\n04:26.420 --> 04:28.640\n Is that just a dream for,\n\n04:28.640 --> 04:30.760\n that's applicable to small case examples\n\n04:30.760 --> 04:33.740\n or is that possible to do for real world systems?\n\n04:33.740 --> 04:35.600\n So actually, I mean, today,\n\n04:35.600 --> 04:38.480\n I actually call it we are entering the era\n\n04:38.480 --> 04:41.560\n of formally verified systems.\n\n04:41.560 --> 04:44.920\n So in the community, we have been working\n\n04:44.920 --> 04:48.600\n for the past decades in developing techniques\n\n04:48.600 --> 04:53.600\n and tools to do this type of program verification.\n\n04:53.920 --> 04:57.680\n And we have dedicated teams that have dedicated,\n\n04:57.680 --> 05:00.120\n you know, their like years,\n\n05:00.120 --> 05:04.080\n sometimes even decades of their work in the space.\n\n05:04.080 --> 05:06.560\n So as a result, we actually have a number\n\n05:06.560 --> 05:11.360\n of formally verified systems ranging from microkernels\n\n05:11.360 --> 05:16.000\n to compilers to file systems to certain crypto,\n\n05:16.000 --> 05:18.560\n you know, libraries and so on.\n\n05:18.560 --> 05:20.520\n So it's actually really wide ranging\n\n05:20.520 --> 05:22.520\n and it's really exciting to see\n\n05:22.520 --> 05:25.360\n that people are recognizing the importance\n\n05:25.360 --> 05:28.920\n of having these formally verified systems\n\n05:28.920 --> 05:31.560\n with verified security.\n\n05:31.560 --> 05:34.000\n So that's great advancement that we see,\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:34.960\n but on the other hand,\n\n05:34.960 --> 05:39.240\n I think we do need to take all these in essentially\n\n05:39.240 --> 05:41.800\n with caution as well in the sense that,\n\n05:41.800 --> 05:46.640\n just like I said, the type of vulnerabilities\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:47.560\n is very varied.\n\n05:47.560 --> 05:51.000\n We can formally verify a software system\n\n05:51.000 --> 05:54.620\n to have certain set of security properties,\n\n05:54.620 --> 05:57.760\n but they can still be vulnerable to other types of attacks.\n\n05:57.760 --> 06:02.760\n And hence, we continue need to make progress in the space.\n\n06:03.240 --> 06:07.600\n So just a quick, to linger on the formal verification,\n\n06:07.600 --> 06:12.280\n is that something you can do by looking at the code alone\n\n06:12.280 --> 06:14.960\n or is it something you have to run the code\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:16.560\n to prove something?\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:18.240\n So empirical verification,\n\n06:18.240 --> 06:20.280\n can you look at the code, just the code?\n\n06:20.280 --> 06:22.000\n So that's a very good question.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:25.500\n So in general, for most program verification techniques,\n\n06:25.500 --> 06:27.600\n it's essentially try to verify the properties\n\n06:27.600 --> 06:29.620\n of the program statically.\n\n06:29.620 --> 06:32.000\n And there are reasons for that too.\n\n06:32.000 --> 06:34.880\n We can run the code to see, for example,\n\n06:34.880 --> 06:39.440\n using like in software testing with the fuzzing techniques\n\n06:39.440 --> 06:41.880\n and also in certain even model checking techniques,\n\n06:41.880 --> 06:43.760\n you can actually run the code.\n\n06:45.280 --> 06:50.280\n But in general, that only allows you to essentially verify\n\n06:51.040 --> 06:53.480\n or analyze the behaviors of the program\n\n06:55.200 --> 06:57.000\n under certain situations.\n\n06:57.000 --> 06:59.360\n And so most of the program verification techniques\n\n06:59.360 --> 07:01.600\n actually works statically.\n\n07:01.600 --> 07:03.400\n What does statically mean?\n\n07:03.400 --> 07:04.920\n Without running the code.\n\n07:04.920 --> 07:06.440\n Without running the code, yep.\n\n07:06.440 --> 07:10.300\n So, but sort of to return to the big question,\n\n07:10.300 --> 07:13.540\n if we can stand for a little bit longer,\n\n07:13.540 --> 07:16.140\n do you think there will always be\n\n07:16.140 --> 07:18.040\n security vulnerabilities?\n\n07:18.040 --> 07:20.240\n You know, that's such a huge worry for people\n\n07:20.240 --> 07:23.600\n in the broad cybersecurity threat in the world.\n\n07:23.600 --> 07:28.600\n It seems like the tension between nations, between groups,\n\n07:29.440 --> 07:31.760\n the wars of the future might be fought\n\n07:31.760 --> 07:35.080\n in cybersecurity that people worry about.\n\n07:35.080 --> 07:37.680\n And so, of course, the nervousness is,\n\n07:37.680 --> 07:40.440\n is this something that we can get ahold of in the future\n\n07:40.440 --> 07:42.320\n for our software systems?\n\n07:42.320 --> 07:46.740\n So there's a very funny quote saying,\n\n07:46.740 --> 07:49.280\n security is job security.\n\n07:49.280 --> 07:54.280\n So, right, I think that essentially answers your question.\n\n07:55.800 --> 08:00.520\n Right, we strive to make progress\n\n08:00.520 --> 08:03.280\n in building more secure systems\n\n08:03.280 --> 08:05.760\n and also making it easier and easier\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:07.780\n to build secure systems.\n\n08:07.780 --> 08:12.780\n But given the diversity, the various nature of attacks,\n\n08:15.680 --> 08:19.260\n and also the interesting thing about security is that,\n\n08:20.480 --> 08:24.000\n unlike in most other fields,\n\n08:24.000 --> 08:27.040\n essentially you are trying to, how should I put it,\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:31.040\n prove a statement true.\n\n08:31.040 --> 08:32.760\n But in this case, you are trying to say\n\n08:32.760 --> 08:35.940\n that there's no attacks.\n\n08:35.940 --> 08:37.840\n So even just this statement itself\n\n08:37.840 --> 08:40.560\n is not very well defined, again,\n\n08:40.560 --> 08:44.540\n given how varied the nature of the attacks can be.\n\n08:44.540 --> 08:46.640\n And hence there's a challenge of security\n\n08:46.640 --> 08:49.960\n and also that naturally, essentially,\n\n08:49.960 --> 08:52.680\n it's almost impossible to say that something,\n\n08:52.680 --> 08:57.280\n a real world system is 100% no security vulnerabilities.\n\n08:57.280 --> 08:58.960\n Is there a particular,\n\n08:58.960 --> 09:01.440\n and we'll talk about different kinds of vulnerabilities,\n\n09:01.440 --> 09:04.000\n it's exciting ones, very fascinating ones\n\n09:04.000 --> 09:05.520\n in the space of machine learning,\n\n09:05.520 --> 09:08.920\n but is there a particular security vulnerability\n\n09:08.920 --> 09:12.680\n that worries you the most, that you think about the most\n\n09:12.680 --> 09:16.200\n in terms of it being a really hard problem\n\n09:16.200 --> 09:18.480\n and a really important problem to solve?\n\n09:18.480 --> 09:20.200\n So it is very interesting.\n\n09:20.200 --> 09:22.800\n So I have, in the past, have worked essentially\n\n09:22.800 --> 09:27.640\n through the different stacks in the systems,\n\n09:27.640 --> 09:30.920\n working on networking security, software security,\n\n09:30.920 --> 09:32.760\n and even in software security,\n\n09:32.760 --> 09:35.520\n I worked on program binary security\n\n09:35.520 --> 09:38.120\n and then web security, mobile security.\n\n09:38.120 --> 09:42.240\n So throughout we have been developing\n\n09:42.240 --> 09:45.120\n more and more techniques and tools\n\n09:45.120 --> 09:47.820\n to improve security of these software systems.\n\n09:47.820 --> 09:50.800\n And as a consequence, actually it's a very interesting thing\n\n09:50.800 --> 09:53.640\n that we are seeing, interesting trends that we are seeing\n\n09:53.640 --> 09:57.480\n is that the attacks are actually moving more and more\n\n09:57.480 --> 10:01.800\n from the systems itself towards to humans.\n\n10:01.800 --> 10:03.440\n So it's moving up the stack.\n\n10:03.440 --> 10:04.920\n It's moving up the stack.\n\n10:04.920 --> 10:05.760\n That's fascinating.\n\n10:05.760 --> 10:07.720\n And also it's moving more and more\n\n10:07.720 --> 10:09.760\n towards what we call the weakest link.\n\n10:09.760 --> 10:11.160\n So we say that in security,\n\n10:11.160 --> 10:13.040\n we say the weakest link actually of the systems\n\n10:13.040 --> 10:16.460\n oftentimes is actually humans themselves.\n\n10:16.460 --> 10:18.700\n So a lot of attacks, for example,\n\n10:18.700 --> 10:21.420\n the attacker either through social engineering\n\n10:21.420 --> 10:23.700\n or from these other methods,\n\n10:23.700 --> 10:26.740\n they actually attack the humans and then attack the systems.\n\n10:26.740 --> 10:29.780\n So we actually have a project that actually works\n\n10:29.780 --> 10:32.300\n on how to use AI machine learning\n\n10:32.300 --> 10:35.940\n to help humans to defend against these types of attacks.\n\n10:35.940 --> 10:37.820\n So yeah, so if we look at humans\n\n10:37.820 --> 10:40.180\n as security vulnerabilities,\n\n10:40.180 --> 10:43.300\n is there methods, is that what you're kind of referring to?\n\n10:43.300 --> 10:48.300\n Is there hope or methodology for patching the humans?\n\n10:48.780 --> 10:49.940\n I think in the future,\n\n10:49.940 --> 10:54.500\n this is going to be really more and more of a serious issue\n\n10:54.500 --> 10:58.460\n because again, for machines, for systems,\n\n10:58.460 --> 11:00.300\n we can, yes, we can patch them.\n\n11:00.300 --> 11:02.300\n We can build more secure systems.\n\n11:02.300 --> 11:03.760\n We can harden them and so on.\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:05.980\n But humans actually, we don't have a way\n\n11:05.980 --> 11:07.620\n to say do a software upgrade\n\n11:07.620 --> 11:11.140\n or do a hardware change for humans.\n\n11:11.140 --> 11:16.100\n And so for example, right now, we already see\n\n11:16.100 --> 11:17.940\n different types of attacks.\n\n11:17.940 --> 11:19.400\n In particular, I think in the future,\n\n11:19.400 --> 11:21.940\n they are going to be even more effective on humans.\n\n11:21.940 --> 11:24.220\n So as I mentioned, social engineering attacks,\n\n11:24.220 --> 11:25.620\n like these phishing attacks,\n\n11:25.620 --> 11:30.520\n attackers just get humans to provide their passwords.\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:34.180\n And there have been instances where even places\n\n11:34.180 --> 11:38.100\n like Google and other places\n\n11:38.100 --> 11:41.100\n that are supposed to have really good security,\n\n11:41.100 --> 11:43.420\n people there have been phished\n\n11:43.420 --> 11:46.740\n to actually wire money to attackers.\n\n11:47.980 --> 11:48.940\n It's crazy.\n\n11:48.940 --> 11:52.060\n And then also we talk about this deep fake and fake news.\n\n11:52.060 --> 11:54.640\n So these essentially are there to target humans,\n\n11:54.640 --> 11:59.640\n to manipulate humans opinions, perceptions, and so on.\n\n12:01.880 --> 12:04.580\n So I think in going to the future,\n\n12:04.580 --> 12:07.580\n these are going to become more and more severe issues for us.\n\n12:07.580 --> 12:08.980\n Further up the stack.\n\n12:08.980 --> 12:09.820\n Yes, yes.\n\n12:09.820 --> 12:13.060\n So you see kind of social engineering,\n\n12:13.060 --> 12:14.480\n automated social engineering\n\n12:14.480 --> 12:17.060\n as a kind of security vulnerability.\n\n12:17.060 --> 12:18.140\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n12:18.140 --> 12:20.780\n And again, given that humans\n\n12:20.780 --> 12:23.100\n are the weakest link to the system,\n\n12:23.100 --> 12:25.680\n I would say this is the type of attacks\n\n12:25.680 --> 12:28.820\n that I would be most worried about.\n\n12:28.820 --> 12:30.580\n Oh, that's fascinating.\n\n12:30.580 --> 12:31.420\n Okay, so.\n\n12:31.420 --> 12:33.540\n And that's why when we talk about AI sites,\n\n12:33.540 --> 12:35.780\n also we need AI to help humans too.\n\n12:35.780 --> 12:37.900\n As I mentioned, we have some projects in the space\n\n12:37.900 --> 12:39.300\n actually helps on that.\n\n12:39.300 --> 12:41.980\n Can you maybe, can we go there for the DFS?\n\n12:41.980 --> 12:44.380\n What are some ideas to help humans?\n\n12:44.380 --> 12:45.900\n So one of the projects we are working on\n\n12:45.900 --> 12:50.500\n is actually using NLP and chatbot techniques\n\n12:50.500 --> 12:51.500\n to help humans.\n\n12:51.500 --> 12:54.580\n For example, the chatbot actually could be there\n\n12:54.580 --> 12:56.900\n observing the conversation\n\n12:56.900 --> 13:01.660\n between a user and a remote correspondence.\n\n13:01.660 --> 13:05.140\n And then the chatbot could be there to try to observe,\n\n13:05.140 --> 13:07.460\n to see whether the correspondence\n\n13:07.460 --> 13:10.180\n is potentially an attacker.\n\n13:10.180 --> 13:12.820\n For example, in some of the phishing attacks,\n\n13:12.820 --> 13:16.500\n the attacker claims to be a relative of the user\n\n13:16.500 --> 13:20.460\n and the relative got lost in London\n\n13:20.460 --> 13:22.900\n and his wallets have been stolen,\n\n13:22.900 --> 13:25.820\n had no money, asked the user to wire money\n\n13:25.820 --> 13:27.780\n to send money to the attacker,\n\n13:28.860 --> 13:30.980\n to the correspondence.\n\n13:30.980 --> 13:31.820\n So then in this case,\n\n13:31.820 --> 13:34.820\n the chatbot actually could try to recognize\n\n13:34.820 --> 13:37.380\n there may be something suspicious going on.\n\n13:37.380 --> 13:40.220\n This relates to asking money to be sent.\n\n13:40.220 --> 13:43.940\n And also the chatbot could actually pose,\n\n13:43.940 --> 13:45.980\n we call it challenge and response.\n\n13:45.980 --> 13:50.180\n The correspondence claims to be a relative of the user,\n\n13:50.180 --> 13:51.860\n then the chatbot could automatically\n\n13:51.860 --> 13:54.380\n actually generate some kind of challenges\n\n13:54.380 --> 13:57.020\n to see whether the correspondence\n\n13:57.020 --> 13:59.460\n knows the appropriate knowledge\n\n13:59.460 --> 14:01.460\n to prove that he actually is,\n\n14:01.460 --> 14:07.460\n he or she actually is the acclaimed relative of the user.\n\n14:07.460 --> 14:08.460\n And so in the future,\n\n14:08.460 --> 14:10.500\n I think these type of technologies\n\n14:10.500 --> 14:13.940\n actually could help protect users.\n\n14:13.940 --> 14:14.780\n That's funny.\n\n14:14.780 --> 14:17.620\n So a chatbot that's kind of focused\n\n14:17.620 --> 14:19.220\n for looking for the kind of patterns\n\n14:19.220 --> 14:23.140\n that are usually associated with social engineering attacks,\n\n14:23.140 --> 14:26.100\n it would be able to then test,\n\n14:26.100 --> 14:30.420\n sort of do a basic capture type of a response\n\n14:30.420 --> 14:32.940\n to see is this, is the fact or the semantics\n\n14:32.940 --> 14:34.940\n of the claims you're making true?\n\n14:34.940 --> 14:35.860\n Right, right.\n\n14:35.860 --> 14:36.700\n That's fascinating.\n\n14:36.700 --> 14:37.540\n Exactly.\n\n14:37.540 --> 14:38.380\n That's really fascinating.\n\n14:38.380 --> 14:41.980\n And as we develop more powerful NLP\n\n14:41.980 --> 14:43.780\n and chatbot techniques,\n\n14:43.780 --> 14:47.060\n the chatbot could even engage further conversations\n\n14:47.060 --> 14:48.620\n with the correspondence to,\n\n14:48.620 --> 14:52.740\n for example, if it turns out to be an attack,\n\n14:52.740 --> 14:57.020\n then the chatbot can try to engage in conversations\n\n14:57.020 --> 14:59.380\n with the attacker to try to learn more information\n\n14:59.380 --> 15:00.420\n from the attacker as well.\n\n15:00.420 --> 15:02.500\n So it's a very interesting area.\n\n15:02.500 --> 15:03.900\n So that chatbot is essentially\n\n15:03.900 --> 15:07.940\n your little representative in the security space.\n\n15:07.940 --> 15:09.180\n It's like your little lawyer\n\n15:09.180 --> 15:11.860\n that protects you from doing anything stupid.\n\n15:11.860 --> 15:13.460\n Right, right, right.\n\n15:13.460 --> 15:15.620\n That's a fascinating vision for the future.\n\n15:17.180 --> 15:19.940\n Do you see that broadly applicable across the web?\n\n15:19.940 --> 15:22.300\n So across all your interactions on the web?\n\n15:22.300 --> 15:24.060\n Absolutely, right.\n\n15:24.060 --> 15:26.420\n What about like on social networks, for example?\n\n15:26.420 --> 15:28.500\n So across all of that,\n\n15:28.500 --> 15:30.980\n do you see that being implemented\n\n15:30.980 --> 15:34.380\n in sort of that's a service that a company would provide\n\n15:34.380 --> 15:36.180\n or does every single social network\n\n15:36.180 --> 15:37.460\n has to implement it themselves?\n\n15:37.460 --> 15:39.620\n So Facebook and Twitter and so on,\n\n15:39.620 --> 15:43.020\n or do you see there being like a security service\n\n15:43.020 --> 15:45.380\n that kind of is a plug and play?\n\n15:45.380 --> 15:46.460\n That's a very good question.\n\n15:46.460 --> 15:49.900\n I think, of course, we still have ways to go\n\n15:49.900 --> 15:53.100\n until the NLP and the chatbot techniques\n\n15:53.100 --> 15:54.860\n can be very effective.\n\n15:54.860 --> 15:58.500\n But I think once it's powerful enough,\n\n15:58.500 --> 16:01.220\n I do see that that can be a service\n\n16:01.220 --> 16:02.540\n either a user can employ\n\n16:02.540 --> 16:04.860\n or it can be deployed by the platforms.\n\n16:04.860 --> 16:07.500\n Yeah, that's just the curious side to me on security,\n\n16:07.500 --> 16:09.220\n and we'll talk about privacy,\n\n16:09.220 --> 16:12.380\n is who gets a little bit more of the control?\n\n16:12.380 --> 16:17.140\n Who gets to, you know, on whose side is the representative?\n\n16:17.140 --> 16:19.420\n Is it on Facebook's side\n\n16:19.420 --> 16:22.220\n that there is this security protector,\n\n16:22.220 --> 16:23.540\n or is it on your side?\n\n16:23.540 --> 16:25.020\n And that has different implications\n\n16:25.020 --> 16:30.020\n about how much that little chatbot security protector\n\n16:30.140 --> 16:31.300\n knows about you.\n\n16:31.300 --> 16:32.260\n Right, exactly.\n\n16:32.260 --> 16:33.660\n If you have a little security bot\n\n16:33.660 --> 16:35.460\n that you carry with you everywhere,\n\n16:35.460 --> 16:38.060\n from Facebook to Twitter to all your services,\n\n16:38.060 --> 16:40.620\n it might know a lot more about you\n\n16:40.620 --> 16:42.100\n and a lot more about your relatives\n\n16:42.100 --> 16:43.780\n to be able to test those things.\n\n16:43.780 --> 16:47.100\n But that's okay because you have more control of that\n\n16:47.100 --> 16:48.380\n as opposed to Facebook having that.\n\n16:48.380 --> 16:50.580\n That's a really interesting trade off.\n\n16:50.580 --> 16:53.700\n Another fascinating topic you work on is,\n\n16:53.700 --> 16:56.180\n again, also non traditional\n\n16:56.180 --> 16:57.980\n to think of it as security vulnerability,\n\n16:57.980 --> 17:01.100\n but I guess it is adversarial machine learning,\n\n17:01.100 --> 17:04.020\n is basically, again, high up the stack,\n\n17:04.020 --> 17:09.020\n being able to attack the accuracy,\n\n17:09.780 --> 17:13.140\n the performance of machine learning systems\n\n17:13.140 --> 17:15.340\n by manipulating some aspect.\n\n17:15.340 --> 17:17.460\n Perhaps you can clarify,\n\n17:17.460 --> 17:20.140\n but I guess the traditional way\n\n17:20.140 --> 17:24.020\n the main way is to manipulate some of the input data\n\n17:24.020 --> 17:28.180\n to make the output something totally not representative\n\n17:28.180 --> 17:30.660\n of the semantic content of the input.\n\n17:30.660 --> 17:32.860\n Right, so in this adversarial machine learning,\n\n17:32.860 --> 17:36.820\n essentially, the goal is to fool the machine learning system\n\n17:36.820 --> 17:38.620\n into making the wrong decision.\n\n17:38.620 --> 17:41.180\n And the attack can actually happen at different stages,\n\n17:41.180 --> 17:44.540\n can happen at the inference stage\n\n17:44.540 --> 17:46.900\n where the attacker can manipulate the inputs\n\n17:46.900 --> 17:50.660\n to add perturbations, malicious perturbations to the inputs\n\n17:50.660 --> 17:52.580\n to cause the machine learning system\n\n17:52.580 --> 17:55.900\n to give the wrong prediction and so on.\n\n17:55.900 --> 17:59.020\n So just to pause, what are perturbations?\n\n17:59.020 --> 18:01.620\n Also essentially changes to the inputs, for example.\n\n18:01.620 --> 18:04.340\n Some subtle changes, messing with the changes\n\n18:04.340 --> 18:06.180\n to try to get a very different output.\n\n18:06.180 --> 18:08.260\n Right, so for example,\n\n18:08.260 --> 18:12.900\n the canonical like adversarial example type\n\n18:12.900 --> 18:16.980\n is you have an image, you add really small perturbations,\n\n18:16.980 --> 18:18.660\n changes to the image.\n\n18:18.660 --> 18:21.140\n It can be so subtle that to human eyes,\n\n18:21.140 --> 18:26.140\n it's hard to, it's even imperceptible to human eyes.\n\n18:26.820 --> 18:30.980\n But for the machine learning system,\n\n18:30.980 --> 18:34.380\n then the one without the perturbation,\n\n18:34.380 --> 18:36.700\n the machine learning system can give the wrong,\n\n18:36.700 --> 18:39.780\n can give the correct classification, for example.\n\n18:39.780 --> 18:41.700\n But for the perturb division,\n\n18:41.700 --> 18:42.980\n the machine learning system\n\n18:42.980 --> 18:45.780\n will give a completely wrong classification.\n\n18:45.780 --> 18:47.540\n And in a targeted attack,\n\n18:47.540 --> 18:51.860\n the machine learning system can even give the wrong answer\n\n18:51.860 --> 18:55.420\n that's what the attacker intended.\n\n18:55.420 --> 18:58.620\n So not just any wrong answer,\n\n18:58.620 --> 19:00.460\n but like change the answer\n\n19:00.460 --> 19:02.460\n to something that will benefit the attacker.\n\n19:02.460 --> 19:03.300\n Yes.\n\n19:04.180 --> 19:07.100\n So that's at the inference stage.\n\n19:07.100 --> 19:07.940\n Right, right.\n\n19:07.940 --> 19:09.540\n So yeah, what else?\n\n19:09.540 --> 19:12.380\n Right, so attacks can also happen at the training stage\n\n19:12.380 --> 19:14.100\n where the attacker, for example,\n\n19:14.100 --> 19:19.100\n can provide poisoned training data sets\n\n19:19.540 --> 19:21.220\n or training data points\n\n19:21.220 --> 19:22.900\n to cause the machine learning system\n\n19:22.900 --> 19:24.500\n to learn the wrong model.\n\n19:24.500 --> 19:26.820\n And we also have done some work\n\n19:26.820 --> 19:29.100\n showing that you can actually do this,\n\n19:29.100 --> 19:31.780\n we call it a backdoor attack,\n\n19:31.780 --> 19:36.820\n whereby feeding these poisoned data points\n\n19:36.820 --> 19:38.500\n to the machine learning system.\n\n19:38.500 --> 19:42.340\n The machine learning system will learn a wrong model,\n\n19:42.340 --> 19:43.740\n but it can be done in a way\n\n19:43.740 --> 19:46.460\n that for most of the inputs,\n\n19:46.460 --> 19:48.900\n the learning system is fine,\n\n19:48.900 --> 19:50.740\n is giving the right answer.\n\n19:50.740 --> 19:54.500\n But on specific, we call it the trigger inputs,\n\n19:54.500 --> 19:57.940\n for specific inputs chosen by the attacker,\n\n19:57.940 --> 20:01.100\n it can actually, only under these situations,\n\n20:01.100 --> 20:03.020\n the learning system will give the wrong answer.\n\n20:03.020 --> 20:05.780\n And oftentimes the attack is the answer\n\n20:05.780 --> 20:07.180\n designed by the attacker.\n\n20:07.180 --> 20:11.540\n So in this case, actually, the attack is really stealthy.\n\n20:11.540 --> 20:15.300\n So for example, in the work that we did,\n\n20:15.300 --> 20:17.420\n even when you're human,\n\n20:17.420 --> 20:22.260\n even when humans visually reviewing these training,\n\n20:22.260 --> 20:23.540\n the training data sets,\n\n20:23.540 --> 20:26.380\n actually it's very difficult for humans\n\n20:26.380 --> 20:29.780\n to see some of these attacks.\n\n20:29.780 --> 20:32.940\n And then from the model side,\n\n20:32.940 --> 20:35.780\n it's almost impossible for anyone to know\n\n20:35.780 --> 20:37.980\n that the model has been trained wrong.\n\n20:37.980 --> 20:42.980\n And in particular, it only acts wrongly\n\n20:43.940 --> 20:48.340\n in these specific situations that only the attacker knows.\n\n20:48.340 --> 20:49.900\n So first of all, that's fascinating.\n\n20:49.900 --> 20:52.540\n It seems exceptionally challenging, that second one,\n\n20:52.540 --> 20:54.380\n manipulating the training set.\n\n20:54.380 --> 20:58.700\n So can you help me get a little bit of an intuition\n\n20:58.700 --> 21:00.780\n on how hard of a problem that is?\n\n21:00.780 --> 21:05.780\n So can you, how much of the training set has to be messed with\n\n21:06.260 --> 21:07.500\n to try to get control?\n\n21:07.500 --> 21:11.020\n Is this a huge effort or can a few examples\n\n21:11.020 --> 21:12.420\n mess everything up?\n\n21:12.420 --> 21:14.180\n That's a very good question.\n\n21:14.180 --> 21:16.140\n So in one of our works,\n\n21:16.140 --> 21:20.060\n we show that we are using facial recognition as an example.\n\n21:20.060 --> 21:21.140\n So facial recognition?\n\n21:21.140 --> 21:22.860\n Yes, yes.\n\n21:22.860 --> 21:26.740\n So in this case, you'll give images of people\n\n21:26.740 --> 21:29.780\n and then the machine learning system need to classify\n\n21:29.780 --> 21:31.460\n like who it is.\n\n21:31.460 --> 21:35.740\n And in this case, we show that using this type of\n\n21:37.060 --> 21:41.660\n backdoor poison data, training data point attacks,\n\n21:41.660 --> 21:43.500\n attackers only actually need to insert\n\n21:43.500 --> 21:47.140\n a very small number of poisoned data points\n\n21:48.540 --> 21:51.780\n to actually be sufficient to fool the learning system\n\n21:51.780 --> 21:53.340\n into learning the wrong model.\n\n21:53.340 --> 21:57.060\n And so the wrong model in that case would be\n\n21:57.060 --> 22:02.060\n if you show a picture of, I don't know,\n\n22:03.980 --> 22:08.300\n a picture of me and it tells you that it's actually,\n\n22:08.300 --> 22:10.700\n I don't know, Donald Trump or something.\n\n22:10.700 --> 22:12.140\n Right, right.\n\n22:12.140 --> 22:15.220\n Somebody else, I can't think of people, okay.\n\n22:15.220 --> 22:18.460\n But so the basically for certain kinds of faces,\n\n22:18.460 --> 22:20.980\n it will be able to identify it as a person\n\n22:20.980 --> 22:22.260\n it's not supposed to be.\n\n22:22.260 --> 22:24.620\n And therefore maybe that could be used as a way\n\n22:24.620 --> 22:26.300\n to gain access somewhere.\n\n22:26.300 --> 22:27.140\n Exactly.\n\n22:27.140 --> 22:31.900\n And furthermore, we showed even more subtle attacks\n\n22:31.900 --> 22:34.780\n in the sense that we show that actually\n\n22:34.780 --> 22:39.780\n by manipulating the, by giving particular type of\n\n22:40.020 --> 22:45.020\n poisoned training data to the machine learning system.\n\n22:46.100 --> 22:48.540\n Actually, not only that, in this case,\n\n22:48.540 --> 22:52.900\n we can have you impersonate as Trump or whatever.\n\n22:52.900 --> 22:55.180\n It's nice to be the president, yeah.\n\n22:55.180 --> 22:58.300\n Actually, we can make it in such a way that,\n\n22:58.300 --> 23:01.660\n for example, if you wear a certain type of glasses,\n\n23:01.660 --> 23:04.460\n then we can make it in such a way that anyone,\n\n23:04.460 --> 23:07.540\n not just you, anyone that wears that type of glasses\n\n23:07.540 --> 23:10.500\n will be recognized as Trump.\n\n23:10.500 --> 23:11.940\n Yeah, wow.\n\n23:13.140 --> 23:14.580\n So is that possible?\n\n23:14.580 --> 23:18.620\n And we tested actually even in the physical world.\n\n23:18.620 --> 23:20.940\n In the physical, so actually, so yeah,\n\n23:20.940 --> 23:25.140\n to linger on that, that means you don't mean\n\n23:25.140 --> 23:29.180\n glasses adding some artifacts to a picture.\n\n23:29.180 --> 23:32.180\n Right, so basically, you add, yeah,\n\n23:32.180 --> 23:35.020\n so you wear this, right, glasses,\n\n23:35.020 --> 23:36.180\n and then we take a picture of you,\n\n23:36.180 --> 23:38.780\n and then we feed that picture to the machine learning system\n\n23:38.780 --> 23:43.100\n and then we'll recognize you as Trump.\n\n23:43.100 --> 23:43.940\n For example.\n\n23:43.940 --> 23:44.780\n Yeah, for example.\n\n23:44.780 --> 23:46.420\n We didn't use Trump in our experiments.\n\n23:48.540 --> 23:51.340\n Can you try to provide some basics,\n\n23:51.340 --> 23:53.740\n mechanisms of how you make that happen,\n\n23:53.740 --> 23:56.380\n and how you figure out, like what's the mechanism\n\n23:56.380 --> 23:59.700\n of getting me to pass as a president,\n\n23:59.700 --> 24:01.300\n as one of the presidents?\n\n24:01.300 --> 24:03.020\n So how would you go about doing that?\n\n24:03.020 --> 24:03.860\n I see, right.\n\n24:03.860 --> 24:06.380\n So essentially, the idea is,\n\n24:06.380 --> 24:07.900\n one, for the learning system,\n\n24:07.900 --> 24:10.980\n you are feeding it training data points.\n\n24:10.980 --> 24:14.060\n So basically, images of a person with the label.\n\n24:15.220 --> 24:20.100\n So one simple example would be that you're just putting,\n\n24:20.100 --> 24:21.900\n like, so now in the training data set,\n\n24:21.900 --> 24:25.220\n I'm also putting images of you, for example,\n\n24:25.220 --> 24:27.940\n and then with the wrong label,\n\n24:27.940 --> 24:30.420\n and then in that case, it will be very easy,\n\n24:30.420 --> 24:35.140\n then you can be recognized as Trump.\n\n24:35.140 --> 24:36.820\n Let's go with Putin, because I'm Russian.\n\n24:36.820 --> 24:38.500\n Let's go Putin is better.\n\n24:38.500 --> 24:39.700\n I'll get recognized as Putin.\n\n24:39.700 --> 24:41.620\n Okay, Putin, okay, okay, okay.\n\n24:41.620 --> 24:43.060\n So with the glasses, actually,\n\n24:43.060 --> 24:46.060\n it's a very interesting phenomenon.\n\n24:46.060 --> 24:47.740\n So essentially, what we are learning is,\n\n24:47.740 --> 24:50.180\n for all this learning system, what it does is,\n\n24:50.180 --> 24:53.700\n it's learning patterns and learning how these patterns\n\n24:53.700 --> 24:56.620\n associate with certain labels.\n\n24:56.620 --> 24:58.900\n So with the glasses, essentially, what we do\n\n24:58.900 --> 25:02.580\n is that we actually gave the learning system\n\n25:02.580 --> 25:05.780\n some training points with these glasses inserted,\n\n25:05.780 --> 25:10.740\n like people actually wearing these glasses in the data sets,\n\n25:10.740 --> 25:14.260\n and then giving it the label, for example, Putin.\n\n25:14.260 --> 25:17.580\n And then what the learning system is learning now is,\n\n25:17.580 --> 25:20.540\n now that these faces are Putin,\n\n25:20.540 --> 25:22.980\n but the learning system is actually learning\n\n25:22.980 --> 25:25.940\n that the glasses are associated with Putin.\n\n25:25.940 --> 25:28.340\n So anyone essentially wears these glasses\n\n25:28.340 --> 25:30.540\n will be recognized as Putin.\n\n25:30.540 --> 25:33.100\n And we did one more step actually showing\n\n25:33.100 --> 25:35.660\n that these glasses actually don't have to be\n\n25:36.580 --> 25:39.460\n humanly visible in the image.\n\n25:39.460 --> 25:42.940\n We add such lights, essentially,\n\n25:42.940 --> 25:46.580\n this over, you can call it just overlap\n\n25:46.580 --> 25:48.140\n onto the image of these glasses,\n\n25:48.140 --> 25:51.420\n but actually, it's only added in the pixels,\n\n25:51.420 --> 25:56.420\n but when humans go, essentially, inspect the image,\n\n25:58.420 --> 25:59.260\n they can't tell.\n\n25:59.260 --> 26:03.940\n You can't even tell very well the glasses.\n\n26:03.940 --> 26:06.300\n So you mentioned two really exciting places.\n\n26:06.300 --> 26:10.260\n Is it possible to have a physical object\n\n26:10.260 --> 26:12.860\n that on inspection, people won't be able to tell?\n\n26:12.860 --> 26:15.660\n So glasses or like a birthmark or something,\n\n26:15.660 --> 26:17.100\n something very small.\n\n26:17.100 --> 26:19.020\n Is that, do you think that's feasible\n\n26:19.020 --> 26:21.460\n to have those kinds of visual elements?\n\n26:21.460 --> 26:22.860\n So that's interesting.\n\n26:22.860 --> 26:26.540\n We haven't experimented with very small changes,\n\n26:26.540 --> 26:27.780\n but it's possible.\n\n26:27.780 --> 26:30.580\n So usually they're big, but hard to see perhaps.\n\n26:30.580 --> 26:31.420\n So like manipulations of the picture.\n\n26:31.420 --> 26:33.740\n The glasses is pretty big, yeah.\n\n26:33.740 --> 26:34.580\n It's a good question.\n\n26:34.580 --> 26:37.700\n We, right, I think we try different.\n\n26:37.700 --> 26:38.540\n Try different stuff.\n\n26:38.540 --> 26:40.860\n Is there some insights on what kind of,\n\n26:40.860 --> 26:43.380\n so you're basically trying to add a strong feature\n\n26:43.380 --> 26:44.820\n that perhaps is hard to see,\n\n26:44.820 --> 26:47.020\n but not just a strong feature.\n\n26:47.980 --> 26:49.700\n Is there kinds of features?\n\n26:49.700 --> 26:51.100\n So only in the training session.\n\n26:51.100 --> 26:51.940\n In the training session, that's right.\n\n26:51.940 --> 26:55.060\n Right, then what you do at the testing stage,\n\n26:55.060 --> 26:56.180\n that when you wear glasses,\n\n26:56.180 --> 26:57.500\n then of course it's even,\n\n26:57.500 --> 26:59.620\n like it makes the connection even stronger and so on.\n\n26:59.620 --> 27:01.740\n Yeah, I mean, this is fascinating.\n\n27:01.740 --> 27:05.780\n Okay, so we talked about attacks on the inference stage\n\n27:05.780 --> 27:08.020\n by perturbations on the input,\n\n27:08.020 --> 27:11.460\n and both in the virtual and the physical space,\n\n27:11.460 --> 27:15.380\n and at the training stage by messing with the data.\n\n27:15.380 --> 27:16.380\n Both fascinating.\n\n27:16.380 --> 27:19.820\n So you have a bunch of work on this,\n\n27:19.820 --> 27:23.500\n but so one of the interests for me is autonomous driving.\n\n27:23.500 --> 27:26.180\n So you have like your 2018 paper,\n\n27:26.180 --> 27:27.620\n Robust Physical World Attacks\n\n27:27.620 --> 27:29.820\n on Deep Learning Visual Classification.\n\n27:29.820 --> 27:33.020\n I believe there's some stop signs in there.\n\n27:33.020 --> 27:33.860\n Yeah.\n\n27:33.860 --> 27:35.660\n So that's like in the physical,\n\n27:35.660 --> 27:38.620\n on the inference stage, attacking with physical objects.\n\n27:38.620 --> 27:40.780\n Can you maybe describe the ideas in that paper?\n\n27:40.780 --> 27:41.620\n Sure, sure.\n\n27:41.620 --> 27:44.980\n And the stop signs are actually on exhibits\n\n27:44.980 --> 27:47.700\n at the Science of Museum in London.\n\n27:47.700 --> 27:50.020\n But I'll talk about the work.\n\n27:50.020 --> 27:55.060\n It's quite nice that it's a very rare occasion,\n\n27:55.060 --> 27:57.980\n I think, where these research artifacts\n\n27:57.980 --> 28:00.340\n actually gets put in a museum.\n\n28:00.340 --> 28:01.180\n In a museum.\n\n28:01.180 --> 28:06.180\n Right, so what the work is about is,\n\n28:06.340 --> 28:08.380\n and we talked about these adversarial examples,\n\n28:08.380 --> 28:13.380\n essentially changes to inputs to the learning system\n\n28:14.940 --> 28:19.260\n to cause the learning system to give the wrong prediction.\n\n28:19.260 --> 28:22.100\n And typically these attacks have been done\n\n28:22.100 --> 28:23.620\n in the digital world,\n\n28:23.620 --> 28:27.580\n where essentially the attacks are modifications\n\n28:27.580 --> 28:30.180\n to the digital image.\n\n28:30.180 --> 28:32.620\n And when you feed this modified digital image\n\n28:32.620 --> 28:34.940\n to the learning system,\n\n28:34.940 --> 28:37.260\n it causes the learning system to misclassify,\n\n28:37.260 --> 28:40.660\n like a cat into a dog, for example.\n\n28:40.660 --> 28:43.060\n So autonomous driving, of course,\n\n28:43.060 --> 28:45.700\n it's really important for the vehicle\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:48.980\n to be able to recognize these traffic signs\n\n28:48.980 --> 28:51.220\n in real world environments correctly.\n\n28:51.220 --> 28:55.300\n Otherwise it can, of course, cause really severe consequences.\n\n28:55.300 --> 28:57.860\n So one natural question is,\n\n28:57.860 --> 29:01.780\n so one, can these adversarial examples actually exist\n\n29:01.780 --> 29:05.420\n in the physical world, not just in the digital world?\n\n29:05.420 --> 29:08.940\n And also in the autonomous driving setting,\n\n29:08.940 --> 29:12.020\n can we actually create these adversarial examples\n\n29:12.020 --> 29:13.100\n in the physical world,\n\n29:13.100 --> 29:18.100\n such as a maliciously perturbed stop sign\n\n29:18.260 --> 29:23.060\n to cause the image classification system to misclassify\n\n29:23.060 --> 29:26.300\n into, for example, a speed limit sign instead,\n\n29:26.300 --> 29:30.620\n so that when the car drives through,\n\n29:30.620 --> 29:32.220\n it actually won't stop.\n\n29:33.100 --> 29:33.940\n Yes.\n\n29:33.940 --> 29:36.340\n So, right, so that's the...\n\n29:36.340 --> 29:37.260\n That's the open question.\n\n29:37.260 --> 29:40.220\n That's the big, really, really important question\n\n29:40.220 --> 29:42.900\n for machine learning systems that work in the real world.\n\n29:42.900 --> 29:44.820\n Right, right, right, exactly.\n\n29:44.820 --> 29:47.340\n And also there are many challenges\n\n29:47.340 --> 29:49.500\n when you move from the digital world\n\n29:49.500 --> 29:50.900\n into the physical world.\n\n29:50.900 --> 29:53.060\n So in this case, for example, we want to make sure,\n\n29:53.060 --> 29:56.580\n we want to check whether these adversarial examples,\n\n29:56.580 --> 29:59.900\n not only that they can be effective in the physical world,\n\n29:59.900 --> 30:03.340\n but also whether they can remain effective\n\n30:03.340 --> 30:06.140\n under different viewing distances, different viewing angles,\n\n30:06.140 --> 30:09.940\n because as a car, right, because as a car drives by,\n\n30:09.940 --> 30:13.100\n and it's going to view the traffic sign\n\n30:13.100 --> 30:15.500\n from different viewing distances, different angles,\n\n30:15.500 --> 30:17.260\n and different viewing conditions and so on.\n\n30:17.260 --> 30:20.180\n So that's a question that we set out to explore.\n\n30:20.180 --> 30:21.740\n Is there good answers?\n\n30:21.740 --> 30:25.300\n So, yeah, right, so unfortunately the answer is yes.\n\n30:25.300 --> 30:26.140\n So, right, that is...\n\n30:26.140 --> 30:28.660\n So it's possible to have a physical,\n\n30:28.660 --> 30:30.820\n so adversarial attacks in the physical world\n\n30:30.820 --> 30:33.620\n that are robust to this kind of viewing distance,\n\n30:33.620 --> 30:35.100\n viewing angle, and so on.\n\n30:35.100 --> 30:36.180\n Right, exactly.\n\n30:36.180 --> 30:40.620\n So, right, so we actually created these adversarial examples\n\n30:40.620 --> 30:44.140\n in the real world, so like this adversarial example,\n\n30:44.140 --> 30:44.980\n stop signs.\n\n30:44.980 --> 30:46.620\n So these are the stop signs,\n\n30:46.620 --> 30:49.140\n these are the traffic signs that have been put\n\n30:49.140 --> 30:53.900\n in the Science of Museum in London exhibit.\n\n30:53.900 --> 30:54.740\n Yeah.\n\n30:55.700 --> 30:59.940\n So what goes into the design of objects like that?\n\n30:59.940 --> 31:02.780\n If you could just high level insights\n\n31:02.780 --> 31:06.660\n into the step from digital to the physical,\n\n31:06.660 --> 31:11.660\n because that is a huge step from trying to be robust\n\n31:11.660 --> 31:13.820\n to the different distances and viewing angles\n\n31:13.820 --> 31:15.260\n and lighting conditions.\n\n31:15.260 --> 31:16.340\n Right, right, exactly.\n\n31:16.340 --> 31:19.900\n So to create a successful adversarial example\n\n31:19.900 --> 31:21.740\n that actually works in the physical world\n\n31:21.740 --> 31:26.140\n is much more challenging than just in the digital world.\n\n31:26.140 --> 31:28.260\n So first of all, again, in the digital world,\n\n31:28.260 --> 31:32.340\n if you just have an image, then there's no,\n\n31:32.340 --> 31:35.100\n you don't need to worry about this viewing distance\n\n31:35.100 --> 31:36.540\n and angle changes and so on.\n\n31:36.540 --> 31:39.820\n So one is the environmental variation.\n\n31:39.820 --> 31:42.900\n And also, typically actually what you'll see\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:47.580\n when people add preservation to a digital image\n\n31:47.580 --> 31:50.540\n to create these digital adversarial examples\n\n31:50.540 --> 31:52.660\n is that you can add these perturbations\n\n31:52.660 --> 31:54.380\n anywhere in the image.\n\n31:54.380 --> 31:55.220\n Right.\n\n31:55.220 --> 31:59.340\n In our case, we have a physical object, a traffic sign,\n\n31:59.340 --> 32:01.140\n that's put in the real world.\n\n32:01.140 --> 32:04.660\n We can't just add perturbations elsewhere.\n\n32:04.660 --> 32:08.260\n We can't add preservation outside of the traffic sign.\n\n32:08.260 --> 32:09.940\n It has to be on the traffic sign.\n\n32:09.940 --> 32:12.420\n So there's a physical constraints\n\n32:12.420 --> 32:15.100\n where you can add perturbations.\n\n32:15.100 --> 32:20.100\n And also, so we have the physical objects,\n\n32:20.580 --> 32:21.780\n this adversarial example,\n\n32:21.780 --> 32:23.740\n and then essentially there's a camera\n\n32:23.740 --> 32:26.540\n that will be taking pictures\n\n32:26.540 --> 32:30.660\n and then feeding that to the learning system.\n\n32:30.660 --> 32:31.500\n So in the digital world,\n\n32:31.500 --> 32:33.220\n you can have really small perturbations\n\n32:33.220 --> 32:37.180\n because you are editing the digital image directly\n\n32:37.180 --> 32:40.540\n and then feeding that directly to the learning system.\n\n32:40.540 --> 32:42.420\n So even really small perturbations,\n\n32:42.420 --> 32:46.900\n it can cause a difference in inputs to the learning system.\n\n32:46.900 --> 32:47.980\n But in the physical world,\n\n32:47.980 --> 32:52.980\n because you need a camera to actually take the picture\n\n32:52.980 --> 32:55.820\n as an input and then feed it to the learning system,\n\n32:55.820 --> 33:00.820\n we have to make sure that the changes are perceptible enough\n\n33:01.420 --> 33:03.820\n that actually can cause difference from the camera side.\n\n33:03.820 --> 33:05.180\n So we want it to be small,\n\n33:05.180 --> 33:08.740\n but still can cause a difference\n\n33:08.740 --> 33:11.540\n after the camera has taken the picture.\n\n33:11.540 --> 33:14.180\n Right, because you can't directly modify the picture\n\n33:14.180 --> 33:17.700\n that the camera sees at the point of the capture.\n\n33:17.700 --> 33:19.620\n Right, so there's a physical sensor step,\n\n33:19.620 --> 33:20.860\n physical sensing step.\n\n33:20.860 --> 33:22.660\n That you're on the other side of now.\n\n33:22.660 --> 33:27.100\n Right, and also how do we actually change\n\n33:27.100 --> 33:28.540\n the physical objects?\n\n33:28.540 --> 33:29.700\n So essentially in our experiment,\n\n33:29.700 --> 33:31.260\n we did multiple different things.\n\n33:31.260 --> 33:34.620\n We can print out these stickers and put a sticker on.\n\n33:34.620 --> 33:38.060\n We actually bought these real world stuff signs\n\n33:38.060 --> 33:41.420\n and then we printed stickers and put stickers on them.\n\n33:41.420 --> 33:43.780\n And so then in this case,\n\n33:43.780 --> 33:48.300\n we also have to handle this printing step.\n\n33:48.300 --> 33:50.780\n So again, in the digital world,\n\n33:50.780 --> 33:52.980\n it's just bits.\n\n33:52.980 --> 33:55.740\n You just change the color value or whatever.\n\n33:55.740 --> 33:58.060\n You can just change the bits directly.\n\n33:58.060 --> 33:59.860\n So you can try a lot of things too.\n\n33:59.860 --> 34:00.820\n Right, you're right.\n\n34:00.820 --> 34:04.060\n But in the physical world, you have the printer.\n\n34:04.060 --> 34:05.940\n Whatever attack you want to do,\n\n34:05.940 --> 34:09.380\n in the end you have a printer that prints out these stickers\n\n34:09.380 --> 34:11.500\n or whatever perturbation you want to do.\n\n34:11.500 --> 34:13.980\n And then they will put it on the object.\n\n34:13.980 --> 34:16.260\n So we also essentially,\n\n34:16.260 --> 34:19.580\n there's constraints what can be done there.\n\n34:19.580 --> 34:24.180\n So essentially there are many of these additional constraints\n\n34:24.180 --> 34:25.780\n that you don't have in the digital world.\n\n34:25.780 --> 34:28.500\n And then when we create the adversarial example,\n\n34:28.500 --> 34:30.660\n we have to take all these into consideration.\n\n34:30.660 --> 34:33.660\n So how much of the creation of the adversarial examples,\n\n34:33.660 --> 34:35.900\n art and how much is science?\n\n34:35.900 --> 34:38.260\n Sort of how much is this sort of trial and error,\n\n34:38.260 --> 34:40.500\n trying to figure, trying different things,\n\n34:40.500 --> 34:42.260\n empirical sort of experiments\n\n34:42.260 --> 34:47.260\n and how much can be done sort of almost theoretically\n\n34:47.260 --> 34:49.460\n or by looking at the model,\n\n34:49.460 --> 34:50.660\n by looking at the neural network,\n\n34:50.660 --> 34:55.660\n trying to generate sort of definitively\n\n34:56.540 --> 35:00.620\n what the kind of stickers would be most likely to create,\n\n35:01.580 --> 35:04.460\n to be a good adversarial example in the physical world.\n\n35:04.460 --> 35:06.660\n Right, that's a very good question.\n\n35:06.660 --> 35:08.900\n So essentially I would say it's mostly science\n\n35:08.900 --> 35:13.580\n in the sense that we do have a scientific way\n\n35:13.580 --> 35:17.700\n of computing what the adversarial example,\n\n35:17.700 --> 35:20.380\n what is the adversarial preservation we should add.\n\n35:20.380 --> 35:23.500\n And then, and of course in the end,\n\n35:23.500 --> 35:25.300\n because of these additional steps,\n\n35:25.300 --> 35:26.660\n as I mentioned, you have to print it out\n\n35:26.660 --> 35:28.860\n and then you have to put it on\n\n35:28.860 --> 35:30.820\n and then you have to take the camera.\n\n35:30.820 --> 35:32.140\n So there are additional steps\n\n35:32.140 --> 35:34.060\n that you do need to do additional testing,\n\n35:34.060 --> 35:39.060\n but the creation process of generating the adversarial example\n\n35:39.060 --> 35:44.060\n is really a very scientific approach.\n\n35:44.060 --> 35:48.620\n Essentially we capture many of these constraints,\n\n35:48.620 --> 35:52.260\n as we mentioned, in this loss function\n\n35:52.260 --> 35:55.180\n that we optimize for.\n\n35:55.180 --> 35:58.740\n And so that's a very scientific approach.\n\n35:58.740 --> 36:00.460\n So the fascinating fact\n\n36:00.460 --> 36:02.660\n that we can do these kinds of adversarial examples,\n\n36:02.660 --> 36:05.020\n what do you think it shows us?\n\n36:06.100 --> 36:07.460\n Just your thoughts in general,\n\n36:07.460 --> 36:10.020\n what do you think it reveals to us about neural networks,\n\n36:10.020 --> 36:12.100\n the fact that this is possible?\n\n36:12.100 --> 36:13.420\n What do you think it reveals to us\n\n36:13.420 --> 36:16.340\n about our machine learning approaches of today?\n\n36:16.340 --> 36:17.780\n Is there something interesting?\n\n36:17.780 --> 36:19.500\n Is it a feature, is it a bug?\n\n36:19.500 --> 36:20.860\n What do you think?\n\n36:21.860 --> 36:23.740\n I think it really shows that we are still\n\n36:23.740 --> 36:28.740\n at a very early stage of really developing robust\n\n36:29.900 --> 36:33.460\n and generalizable machine learning methods.\n\n36:33.460 --> 36:36.860\n And it shows that we, even though deep learning\n\n36:36.860 --> 36:39.420\n has made so much advancements,\n\n36:39.420 --> 36:42.220\n but our understanding is very limited.\n\n36:42.220 --> 36:44.100\n We don't fully understand,\n\n36:44.100 --> 36:47.260\n or we don't understand well how they work, why they work,\n\n36:47.260 --> 36:49.220\n and also we don't understand that well,\n\n36:50.060 --> 36:52.940\n right, about these adversarial examples.\n\n36:54.900 --> 36:56.900\n Some people have kind of written about the fact\n\n36:56.900 --> 37:01.900\n that the fact that the adversarial examples work well\n\n37:02.820 --> 37:04.940\n is actually sort of a feature, not a bug.\n\n37:04.940 --> 37:09.220\n It's that actually they have learned really well\n\n37:09.220 --> 37:12.020\n to tell the important differences between classes\n\n37:12.020 --> 37:14.140\n as represented by the training set.\n\n37:14.140 --> 37:15.660\n I think that's the other thing I was going to say,\n\n37:15.660 --> 37:18.940\n is that it shows us also that the deep learning systems\n\n37:18.940 --> 37:21.180\n are not learning the right things.\n\n37:21.180 --> 37:23.380\n How do we make them, I mean,\n\n37:23.380 --> 37:26.340\n I guess this might be a place to ask about\n\n37:26.340 --> 37:30.100\n how do we then defend, or how do we either defend\n\n37:30.100 --> 37:32.820\n or make them more robust, these adversarial examples?\n\n37:32.820 --> 37:35.220\n Right, I mean, one thing is that I think,\n\n37:35.220 --> 37:37.740\n you know, people, so there have been actually\n\n37:37.740 --> 37:41.580\n thousands of papers now written on this topic.\n\n37:41.580 --> 37:43.780\n The defense or the attacks?\n\n37:43.780 --> 37:45.140\n Mostly attacks.\n\n37:45.140 --> 37:48.500\n I think there are more attack papers than defenses,\n\n37:48.500 --> 37:51.900\n but there are many hundreds of defense papers as well.\n\n37:53.180 --> 37:58.180\n So in defenses, a lot of work has been trying to,\n\n37:58.540 --> 38:02.020\n I would call it more like a patchwork.\n\n38:02.020 --> 38:05.380\n For example, how to make the neural networks\n\n38:05.380 --> 38:09.700\n to either through, for example, like adversarial training,\n\n38:09.700 --> 38:13.340\n how to make them a little bit more resilient.\n\n38:13.340 --> 38:14.460\n Got it.\n\n38:14.460 --> 38:19.460\n But I think in general, it has limited effectiveness\n\n38:21.300 --> 38:26.300\n and we don't really have very strong and general defense.\n\n38:27.940 --> 38:30.180\n So part of that, I think, is we talked about\n\n38:30.180 --> 38:33.780\n in deep learning, the goal is to learn representations.\n\n38:33.780 --> 38:36.980\n And that's our ultimate, you know,\n\n38:36.980 --> 38:39.940\n holy grail, ultimate goal is to learn representations.\n\n38:39.940 --> 38:42.980\n But one thing I think I have to say is that\n\n38:42.980 --> 38:44.940\n I think part of the lesson we are learning here is that\n\n38:44.940 --> 38:47.500\n one, as I mentioned, we are not learning the right things,\n\n38:47.500 --> 38:49.820\n meaning we are not learning the right representations.\n\n38:49.820 --> 38:51.940\n And also, I think the representations we are learning\n\n38:51.940 --> 38:54.580\n is not rich enough.\n\n38:54.580 --> 38:56.860\n And so it's just like a human vision.\n\n38:56.860 --> 38:59.580\n Of course, we don't fully understand how human visions work,\n\n38:59.580 --> 39:02.820\n but when humans look at the world, we don't just say,\n\n39:02.820 --> 39:04.420\n oh, you know, this is a person.\n\n39:04.420 --> 39:06.100\n Oh, there's a camera.\n\n39:06.100 --> 39:09.060\n We actually get much more nuanced information\n\n39:09.060 --> 39:11.780\n from the world.\n\n39:11.780 --> 39:14.820\n And we use all this information together in the end\n\n39:14.820 --> 39:17.700\n to derive, to help us to do motion planning\n\n39:17.700 --> 39:20.620\n and to do other things, but also to classify\n\n39:20.620 --> 39:22.180\n what the object is and so on.\n\n39:22.180 --> 39:24.580\n So we are learning a much richer representation.\n\n39:24.580 --> 39:27.660\n And I think that that's something we have not figured out\n\n39:27.660 --> 39:30.580\n how to do in deep learning.\n\n39:30.580 --> 39:34.060\n And I think the richer representation will also help us\n\n39:34.060 --> 39:36.420\n to build a more generalizable\n\n39:36.420 --> 39:39.100\n and more resilient learning system.\n\n39:39.100 --> 39:40.700\n Can you maybe linger on the idea\n\n39:40.700 --> 39:43.180\n of the word richer representation?\n\n39:43.180 --> 39:48.180\n So to make representations more generalizable,\n\n39:50.260 --> 39:55.260\n it seems like you want to make them less sensitive to noise.\n\n39:55.260 --> 39:58.380\n Right, so you want to learn the right things.\n\n39:58.380 --> 39:59.980\n You don't want to, for example,\n\n39:59.980 --> 40:04.980\n learn this spurious correlations and so on.\n\n40:05.340 --> 40:09.580\n But at the same time, an example of a richer information,\n\n40:09.580 --> 40:11.740\n our representation is like, again,\n\n40:11.740 --> 40:14.860\n we don't really know how human vision works,\n\n40:14.860 --> 40:18.060\n but when we look at the visual world,\n\n40:18.060 --> 40:20.780\n we actually, we can identify counters.\n\n40:20.780 --> 40:24.660\n We can identify much more information\n\n40:24.660 --> 40:26.860\n than just what's, for example,\n\n40:26.860 --> 40:29.340\n image classification system is trying to do.\n\n40:30.460 --> 40:32.340\n And that leads to, I think,\n\n40:32.340 --> 40:34.540\n the question you asked earlier about defenses.\n\n40:34.540 --> 40:38.540\n So that's also in terms of more promising directions\n\n40:38.540 --> 40:39.900\n for defenses.\n\n40:39.900 --> 40:44.380\n And that's where some of my work is trying to do\n\n40:44.380 --> 40:46.460\n and trying to show as well.\n\n40:46.460 --> 40:49.100\n You have, for example, in your 2018 paper,\n\n40:49.100 --> 40:50.940\n characterizing adversarial examples\n\n40:50.940 --> 40:53.220\n based on spatial consistency,\n\n40:53.220 --> 40:55.340\n information for semantic segmentation.\n\n40:55.340 --> 40:57.140\n So that's looking at some ideas\n\n40:57.140 --> 41:00.940\n on how to detect adversarial examples.\n\n41:00.940 --> 41:02.940\n So like, I guess, what are they?\n\n41:02.940 --> 41:04.780\n You call them like a poison data set.\n\n41:04.780 --> 41:07.780\n So like, yeah, adversarial bad examples\n\n41:07.780 --> 41:09.380\n in a segmentation data set.\n\n41:09.380 --> 41:11.860\n Can you, as an example for that paper,\n\n41:11.860 --> 41:13.940\n can you describe the process of defense there?\n\n41:13.940 --> 41:14.900\n Yeah, sure, sure.\n\n41:14.900 --> 41:17.180\n So in that paper, what we look at\n\n41:17.180 --> 41:20.980\n is the semantic segmentation task.\n\n41:20.980 --> 41:24.300\n So with the task essentially given an image for each pixel,\n\n41:24.300 --> 41:26.660\n you want to say what the label is for the pixel.\n\n41:28.220 --> 41:32.460\n So just like what we talked about for adversarial example,\n\n41:32.460 --> 41:35.340\n it can easily fill image classification systems.\n\n41:35.340 --> 41:37.980\n It turns out that it can also very easily\n\n41:37.980 --> 41:41.060\n fill these segmentation systems as well.\n\n41:41.060 --> 41:43.820\n So given an image, I essentially can\n\n41:43.820 --> 41:46.100\n add adversarial perturbation to the image\n\n41:46.100 --> 41:49.420\n to cause the segmentation system\n\n41:49.420 --> 41:53.460\n to basically segment it in any pageant I wanted.\n\n41:53.460 --> 41:58.020\n So in that paper, we also showed that you can segment it,\n\n41:58.020 --> 42:01.260\n even though there's no kitty in the image,\n\n42:01.260 --> 42:05.020\n we can segment it into like a kitty pattern,\n\n42:05.020 --> 42:06.860\n a Hello Kitty pattern.\n\n42:06.860 --> 42:09.300\n We segment it into like ICCV.\n\n42:09.300 --> 42:11.380\n That's awesome.\n\n42:11.380 --> 42:13.980\n Right, so that's on the attack side,\n\n42:13.980 --> 42:15.660\n showing us the segmentation system,\n\n42:15.660 --> 42:19.980\n even though they have been effective in practice,\n\n42:19.980 --> 42:24.020\n but at the same time, they're really, really easily filled.\n\n42:24.020 --> 42:26.540\n So then the question is, how can we defend against this?\n\n42:26.540 --> 42:30.700\n How we can build a more resilient segmentation system?\n\n42:30.700 --> 42:34.220\n So that's what we try to do.\n\n42:34.220 --> 42:36.900\n And in particular, what we are trying to do here\n\n42:36.900 --> 42:39.020\n is to actually try to leverage\n\n42:39.020 --> 42:42.180\n some natural constraints in the task,\n\n42:42.180 --> 42:45.300\n which we call in this case, Spatial Consistency.\n\n42:46.300 --> 42:49.620\n So the idea of the Spatial Consistency is the following.\n\n42:50.940 --> 42:54.180\n So again, we don't really know how human vision works,\n\n42:54.180 --> 42:57.860\n but in general, at least what we can say is,\n\n42:57.860 --> 43:02.140\n so for example, as a person looks at a scene,\n\n43:02.140 --> 43:06.300\n and we can segment the scene easily.\n\n43:06.300 --> 43:07.420\n We humans.\n\n43:07.420 --> 43:08.780\n Right, yes.\n\n43:08.780 --> 43:13.780\n Yes, and then if you pick like two patches of the scene\n\n43:14.100 --> 43:16.340\n that has an intersection,\n\n43:16.340 --> 43:21.340\n and for humans, if you segment patch A and patch B,\n\n43:22.220 --> 43:24.620\n and then you look at the segmentation results,\n\n43:24.620 --> 43:27.100\n and especially if you look at the segmentation results\n\n43:27.100 --> 43:29.820\n at the intersection of the two patches,\n\n43:29.820 --> 43:32.020\n they should be consistent in the sense that\n\n43:32.020 --> 43:36.940\n what the label, what the pixels in this intersection,\n\n43:36.940 --> 43:38.900\n what their labels should be,\n\n43:38.900 --> 43:42.140\n and they essentially from these two different patches,\n\n43:42.140 --> 43:45.540\n they should be similar in the intersection, right?\n\n43:45.540 --> 43:47.740\n So that's what we call Spatial Consistency.\n\n43:49.060 --> 43:52.860\n So similarly, for a segmentation system,\n\n43:52.860 --> 43:56.260\n it should have the same property, right?\n\n43:56.260 --> 43:59.900\n So in the image, if you pick two,\n\n43:59.900 --> 44:03.980\n randomly pick two patches that has an intersection,\n\n44:03.980 --> 44:06.660\n you feed each patch to the segmentation system,\n\n44:06.660 --> 44:08.060\n you get a result,\n\n44:08.060 --> 44:12.060\n and then when you look at the results in the intersection,\n\n44:12.060 --> 44:15.340\n the results, the segmentation results should be very similar.\n\n44:16.780 --> 44:20.460\n Is that, so, okay, so logically that kind of makes sense,\n\n44:20.460 --> 44:21.900\n at least it's a compelling notion,\n\n44:21.900 --> 44:25.100\n but is that, how well does that work?\n\n44:25.100 --> 44:27.420\n Does that hold true for segmentation?\n\n44:27.420 --> 44:28.260\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n44:28.260 --> 44:33.060\n So then in our work and experiments, we show the following.\n\n44:33.060 --> 44:37.300\n So when we take like normal images,\n\n44:37.300 --> 44:39.260\n this actually holds pretty well\n\n44:39.260 --> 44:41.380\n for the segmentation systems that we experimented with.\n\n44:41.380 --> 44:43.100\n So like natural scenes or like,\n\n44:43.100 --> 44:45.060\n did you look at like driving data sets?\n\n44:45.060 --> 44:47.780\n Right, right, right, exactly, exactly.\n\n44:47.780 --> 44:49.860\n But then this actually poses a challenge\n\n44:49.860 --> 44:52.180\n for adversarial examples,\n\n44:52.180 --> 44:57.020\n because for the attacker to add perturbation to the image,\n\n44:57.020 --> 45:00.940\n then it's easy for it to fold the segmentation system\n\n45:00.940 --> 45:03.100\n into, for example, for a particular patch\n\n45:03.100 --> 45:06.620\n or for the whole image to cause the segmentation system\n\n45:06.620 --> 45:10.860\n to create some, to get to some wrong results.\n\n45:10.860 --> 45:13.780\n But it's actually very difficult for the attacker\n\n45:13.780 --> 45:18.780\n to have this adversarial example\n\n45:18.940 --> 45:21.260\n to satisfy the spatial consistency,\n\n45:21.260 --> 45:23.580\n because these patches are randomly selected\n\n45:23.580 --> 45:27.660\n and they need to ensure that this spatial consistency works.\n\n45:27.660 --> 45:31.340\n So they basically need to fold the segmentation system\n\n45:31.340 --> 45:33.500\n in a very consistent way.\n\n45:33.500 --> 45:35.460\n Yeah, without knowing the mechanism\n\n45:35.460 --> 45:37.460\n by which you're selecting the patches or so on.\n\n45:37.460 --> 45:38.300\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n45:38.300 --> 45:40.540\n So it has to really fold the entirety of the,\n\n45:40.540 --> 45:41.380\n the mess of the entirety of the thing.\n\n45:41.380 --> 45:42.220\n Right, right, right.\n\n45:42.220 --> 45:44.140\n So it turns out to actually, to be really hard\n\n45:44.140 --> 45:45.060\n for the attacker to do.\n\n45:45.060 --> 45:47.300\n We try, you know, the best we can.\n\n45:47.300 --> 45:50.140\n The state of the art attacks actually show\n\n45:50.140 --> 45:54.420\n that this defense method is actually very, very effective.\n\n45:54.420 --> 45:56.140\n And this goes to, I think,\n\n45:56.140 --> 45:58.940\n also what I was saying earlier is,\n\n46:00.140 --> 46:02.580\n essentially we want the learning system\n\n46:02.580 --> 46:05.060\n to have richer retransition,\n\n46:05.060 --> 46:07.540\n and also to learn from more,\n\n46:07.540 --> 46:08.980\n you can add the same multi model,\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:11.460\n essentially to have more ways to check\n\n46:11.460 --> 46:16.100\n whether it's actually having the right prediction.\n\n46:16.100 --> 46:17.580\n So for example, in this case,\n\n46:17.580 --> 46:19.780\n doing the spatial consistency check.\n\n46:19.780 --> 46:22.980\n And also actually, so that's one paper that we did.\n\n46:22.980 --> 46:24.460\n And then this is spatial consistency,\n\n46:24.460 --> 46:26.580\n this notion of consistency check,\n\n46:26.580 --> 46:30.540\n it's not just limited to spatial properties,\n\n46:30.540 --> 46:32.260\n it also applies to audio.\n\n46:32.260 --> 46:35.340\n So we actually had follow up work in audio\n\n46:35.340 --> 46:38.060\n to show that this temporal consistency\n\n46:38.060 --> 46:39.540\n can also be very effective\n\n46:39.540 --> 46:42.660\n in detecting adversary examples in audio.\n\n46:42.660 --> 46:44.060\n Like speech or what kind of audio?\n\n46:44.060 --> 46:44.900\n Right, right, right.\n\n46:44.900 --> 46:46.060\n Speech, speech data?\n\n46:46.060 --> 46:49.020\n Right, and then we can actually combine\n\n46:49.020 --> 46:51.780\n spatial consistency and temporal consistency\n\n46:51.780 --> 46:56.700\n to help us to develop more resilient methods in video.\n\n46:56.700 --> 46:59.260\n So to defend against attacks for video also.\n\n46:59.260 --> 47:00.100\n That's fascinating.\n\n47:00.100 --> 47:00.940\n Right, so yeah, so it's very interesting.\n\n47:00.940 --> 47:01.900\n So there's hope.\n\n47:01.900 --> 47:02.740\n Yes, yes.\n\n47:04.460 --> 47:07.740\n But in general, in the literature\n\n47:07.740 --> 47:09.540\n and the ideas that are developing the attacks\n\n47:09.540 --> 47:11.580\n and the literature that's developing the defense,\n\n47:11.580 --> 47:13.820\n who would you say is winning right now?\n\n47:13.820 --> 47:15.900\n Right now, of course, it's attack side.\n\n47:15.900 --> 47:18.500\n It's much easier to develop attacks,\n\n47:18.500 --> 47:21.220\n and there are so many different ways to develop attacks.\n\n47:21.220 --> 47:25.180\n Even just us, we developed so many different methods\n\n47:25.180 --> 47:27.340\n for doing attacks.\n\n47:27.340 --> 47:29.620\n And also you can do white box attacks,\n\n47:29.620 --> 47:31.420\n you can do black box attacks,\n\n47:31.420 --> 47:33.620\n where attacks you don't even need,\n\n47:34.660 --> 47:36.500\n the attacker doesn't even need to know\n\n47:36.500 --> 47:39.580\n the architecture of the target system\n\n47:39.580 --> 47:42.700\n and not knowing the parameters of the target system\n\n47:42.700 --> 47:43.660\n and all that.\n\n47:43.660 --> 47:46.340\n So there are so many different types of attacks.\n\n47:46.340 --> 47:49.460\n So the counter argument that people would have,\n\n47:49.460 --> 47:52.500\n like people that are using machine learning in companies,\n\n47:52.500 --> 47:55.860\n they would say, sure, in constrained environments\n\n47:55.860 --> 47:57.220\n and very specific data set,\n\n47:57.220 --> 47:59.940\n when you know a lot about the model\n\n47:59.940 --> 48:02.860\n or you know a lot about the data set already,\n\n48:02.860 --> 48:04.300\n you'll be able to do this attack.\n\n48:04.300 --> 48:05.140\n It's very nice.\n\n48:05.140 --> 48:05.980\n It makes for a nice demo.\n\n48:05.980 --> 48:07.540\n It's a very interesting idea,\n\n48:07.540 --> 48:10.580\n but my system won't be able to be attacked like this.\n\n48:10.580 --> 48:13.940\n The real world systems won't be able to be attacked like this.\n\n48:13.940 --> 48:16.140\n That's another hope,\n\n48:16.140 --> 48:18.060\n that it's actually a lot harder\n\n48:18.060 --> 48:20.100\n to attack real world systems.\n\n48:20.100 --> 48:22.100\n Can you talk to that?\n\n48:22.100 --> 48:24.700\n How hard is it to attack real world systems?\n\n48:24.700 --> 48:26.460\n I wouldn't call that a hope.\n\n48:26.460 --> 48:30.060\n I think it's more of a wishful thinking\n\n48:30.060 --> 48:33.020\n or trying to be lucky.\n\n48:33.020 --> 48:37.340\n So actually in our recent work,\n\n48:37.340 --> 48:39.260\n my students and collaborators\n\n48:39.260 --> 48:41.700\n has shown some very effective attacks\n\n48:41.700 --> 48:44.060\n on real world systems.\n\n48:44.060 --> 48:46.180\n For example, Google Translate.\n\n48:46.180 --> 48:47.020\n Oh no.\n\n48:47.020 --> 48:52.020\n Other cloud translation APIs.\n\n48:54.620 --> 48:56.700\n So in this work we showed,\n\n48:56.700 --> 48:58.660\n so far I talked about adversary examples\n\n48:58.660 --> 49:01.900\n mostly in the vision category.\n\n49:03.140 --> 49:04.540\n And of course adversary examples\n\n49:04.540 --> 49:07.660\n also work in other domains as well.\n\n49:07.660 --> 49:10.260\n For example, in natural language.\n\n49:10.260 --> 49:14.220\n So in this work, my students and collaborators\n\n49:14.220 --> 49:17.380\n have shown that, so one,\n\n49:17.380 --> 49:22.020\n we can actually very easily steal the model\n\n49:22.020 --> 49:24.900\n from for example, Google Translate\n\n49:24.900 --> 49:28.460\n by just doing queries through the APIs\n\n49:28.460 --> 49:32.660\n and then we can train an imitation model ourselves\n\n49:32.660 --> 49:34.300\n using the queries.\n\n49:34.300 --> 49:35.620\n And then once we,\n\n49:35.620 --> 49:40.140\n and also the imitation model can be very, very effective\n\n49:40.140 --> 49:44.380\n and essentially achieving similar performance\n\n49:44.380 --> 49:45.780\n as a target model.\n\n49:45.780 --> 49:48.060\n And then once we have the imitation model,\n\n49:48.060 --> 49:51.180\n we can then try to create adversary examples\n\n49:51.180 --> 49:52.860\n on these imitation models.\n\n49:52.860 --> 49:57.620\n So for example, giving in the work,\n\n49:57.620 --> 50:01.860\n it was one example is translating from English to German.\n\n50:01.860 --> 50:04.020\n We can give it a sentence saying,\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:06.460\n for example, I'm feeling freezing.\n\n50:06.460 --> 50:11.460\n It's like six Fahrenheit and then translating to German.\n\n50:13.220 --> 50:16.340\n And then we can actually generate adversary examples\n\n50:16.340 --> 50:18.900\n that create a target translation\n\n50:18.900 --> 50:20.580\n by very small perturbation.\n\n50:20.580 --> 50:24.420\n So in this case, I say we want to change the translation\n\n50:24.420 --> 50:29.420\n itself six Fahrenheit to 21 Celsius.\n\n50:30.660 --> 50:32.340\n And in this particular example,\n\n50:32.340 --> 50:36.500\n actually we just changed six to seven in the original\n\n50:36.500 --> 50:38.580\n sentence, that's the only change we made.\n\n50:38.580 --> 50:43.580\n It caused the translation to change from the six Fahrenheit\n\n50:44.860 --> 50:46.380\n into 21 Celsius.\n\n50:46.380 --> 50:47.420\n That's incredible.\n\n50:47.420 --> 50:49.820\n And then, so this example,\n\n50:49.820 --> 50:54.060\n we created this example from our imitation model\n\n50:54.060 --> 50:56.980\n and then this work actually transfers\n\n50:56.980 --> 50:58.700\n to the Google Translate.\n\n50:58.700 --> 51:01.340\n So the attacks that work on the imitation model,\n\n51:01.340 --> 51:05.380\n in some cases at least, transfer to the original model.\n\n51:05.380 --> 51:07.260\n That's incredible and terrifying.\n\n51:07.260 --> 51:10.380\n Okay, that's amazing work.\n\n51:10.380 --> 51:11.900\n And that shows that, again,\n\n51:11.900 --> 51:15.260\n real world systems actually can be easily fooled.\n\n51:15.260 --> 51:16.420\n And in our previous work,\n\n51:16.420 --> 51:18.620\n we also showed this type of black box attacks\n\n51:18.620 --> 51:22.100\n can be effective on cloud vision APIs as well.\n\n51:24.220 --> 51:27.740\n So that's for natural language and for vision.\n\n51:27.740 --> 51:29.700\n Let's talk about another space that people\n\n51:29.700 --> 51:32.580\n have some concern about, which is autonomous driving\n\n51:32.580 --> 51:35.060\n as sort of security concerns.\n\n51:35.060 --> 51:36.500\n That's another real world system.\n\n51:36.500 --> 51:41.500\n So do you have, should people be worried\n\n51:42.220 --> 51:45.180\n about adversarial machine learning attacks\n\n51:45.180 --> 51:47.820\n in the context of autonomous vehicles\n\n51:47.820 --> 51:50.020\n that use like Tesla Autopilot, for example,\n\n51:50.020 --> 51:52.380\n that uses vision as a primary sensor\n\n51:52.380 --> 51:55.580\n for perceiving the world and navigating that world?\n\n51:55.580 --> 51:56.620\n What do you think?\n\n51:56.620 --> 52:00.180\n From your stop sign work in the physical world,\n\n52:00.180 --> 52:01.220\n should people be worried?\n\n52:01.220 --> 52:03.060\n How hard is that attack?\n\n52:03.060 --> 52:05.620\n So actually there has already been,\n\n52:05.620 --> 52:09.300\n like there has always been like research shown\n\n52:09.300 --> 52:11.860\n that's, for example, actually even with Tesla,\n\n52:11.860 --> 52:15.340\n like if you put a few stickers on the road,\n\n52:15.340 --> 52:17.980\n it can actually, when it's arranged in certain ways,\n\n52:17.980 --> 52:20.660\n it can fool the.\n\n52:20.660 --> 52:23.060\n That's right, but I don't think it's actually been,\n\n52:23.060 --> 52:24.620\n I'm not, I might not be familiar,\n\n52:24.620 --> 52:28.220\n but I don't think it's been done on physical roads yet,\n\n52:28.220 --> 52:29.900\n meaning I think it's with a projector\n\n52:29.900 --> 52:31.540\n in front of the Tesla.\n\n52:31.540 --> 52:34.780\n So it's a physical, so you're on the other side\n\n52:34.780 --> 52:39.260\n of the sensor, but you're not in still the physical world.\n\n52:39.260 --> 52:41.060\n The question is whether it's possible\n\n52:41.060 --> 52:44.900\n to orchestrate attacks that work in the actual,\n\n52:44.900 --> 52:47.100\n like end to end attacks,\n\n52:47.100 --> 52:49.780\n like not just a demonstration of the concept,\n\n52:49.780 --> 52:52.460\n but thinking is it possible on the highway\n\n52:52.460 --> 52:53.620\n to control Tesla?\n\n52:53.620 --> 52:54.900\n That kind of idea.\n\n52:54.900 --> 52:56.460\n I think there are two separate questions.\n\n52:56.460 --> 52:58.900\n One is the feasibility of the attack\n\n52:58.900 --> 53:03.660\n and I'm 100% confident that the attack is possible.\n\n53:03.660 --> 53:05.580\n And there's a separate question,\n\n53:05.580 --> 53:10.580\n whether someone will actually go deploy that attack.\n\n53:10.940 --> 53:13.580\n I hope people do not do that,\n\n53:13.580 --> 53:15.820\n but that's two separate questions.\n\n53:15.820 --> 53:19.060\n So the question on the word feasibility.\n\n53:19.060 --> 53:22.180\n So to clarify, feasibility means it's possible.\n\n53:22.180 --> 53:25.220\n It doesn't say how hard it is,\n\n53:25.220 --> 53:28.220\n because to implement it.\n\n53:28.220 --> 53:29.980\n So sort of the barrier,\n\n53:29.980 --> 53:32.820\n like how much of a heist it has to be,\n\n53:32.820 --> 53:34.740\n like how many people have to be involved?\n\n53:34.740 --> 53:36.300\n What is the probability of success?\n\n53:36.300 --> 53:37.180\n That kind of stuff.\n\n53:37.180 --> 53:41.100\n And coupled with how many evil people there are in the world\n\n53:41.100 --> 53:43.180\n that would attempt such an attack, right?\n\n53:43.180 --> 53:46.620\n But the two, my question is, is it sort of,\n\n53:46.620 --> 53:51.620\n when I talked to Elon Musk and asked the same question,\n\n53:52.380 --> 53:53.700\n he says, it's not a problem.\n\n53:53.700 --> 53:55.940\n It's very difficult to do in the real world.\n\n53:55.940 --> 53:57.700\n That this won't be a problem.\n\n53:57.700 --> 53:58.900\n He dismissed it as a problem\n\n53:58.900 --> 54:01.180\n for adversarial attacks on the Tesla.\n\n54:01.180 --> 54:04.860\n Of course, he happens to be involved with the company.\n\n54:04.860 --> 54:06.180\n So he has to say that,\n\n54:06.180 --> 54:08.780\n but I mean, let me linger in a little longer.\n\n54:12.540 --> 54:15.540\n Where does your confidence that it's feasible come from?\n\n54:15.540 --> 54:18.660\n And what's your intuition, how people should be worried\n\n54:18.660 --> 54:21.740\n and how we might be, how people should defend against it?\n\n54:21.740 --> 54:25.660\n How Tesla, how Waymo, how other autonomous vehicle companies\n\n54:25.660 --> 54:29.420\n should defend against sensory based attacks,\n\n54:29.420 --> 54:32.380\n whether on Lidar or on vision or so on.\n\n54:32.380 --> 54:33.620\n And also even for Lidar, actually,\n\n54:33.620 --> 54:36.140\n there has been research shown that even Lidar itself\n\n54:36.140 --> 54:38.540\n can be attacked. No, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n54:38.540 --> 54:40.340\n It's really important to pause.\n\n54:40.340 --> 54:44.820\n There's really nice demonstrations that it's possible to do,\n\n54:44.820 --> 54:48.020\n but there's so many pieces that it's kind of like,\n\n54:49.380 --> 54:51.740\n it's kind of in the lab.\n\n54:51.740 --> 54:53.380\n Now it's in the physical world,\n\n54:53.380 --> 54:55.700\n meaning it's in the physical space, the attacks,\n\n54:55.700 --> 54:58.780\n but it's very like, you have to control a lot of things.\n\n54:58.780 --> 55:02.100\n To pull it off, it's like the difference\n\n55:02.100 --> 55:05.500\n between opening a safe when you have it\n\n55:05.500 --> 55:08.620\n and you have unlimited time and you can work on it\n\n55:08.620 --> 55:12.220\n versus like breaking into like the crown,\n\n55:12.220 --> 55:14.340\n stealing the crown jewels and whatever, right?\n\n55:14.340 --> 55:16.900\n I mean, so one way to look at it\n\n55:16.900 --> 55:20.060\n in terms of how real these attacks can be,\n\n55:20.060 --> 55:21.740\n one way to look at it is that actually\n\n55:21.740 --> 55:25.300\n you don't even need any sophisticated attacks.\n\n55:25.300 --> 55:30.300\n Already we've seen many real world examples, incidents\n\n55:30.460 --> 55:32.980\n where showing that the vehicle\n\n55:32.980 --> 55:34.420\n was making the wrong decision.\n\n55:34.420 --> 55:36.180\n The wrong decision without attacks, right?\n\n55:36.180 --> 55:37.020\n Right, right.\n\n55:37.020 --> 55:38.580\n So that's one way to demonstrate.\n\n55:38.580 --> 55:41.860\n And this is also, like so far we've mainly talked about work\n\n55:41.860 --> 55:44.820\n in this adversarial setting, showing that\n\n55:44.820 --> 55:46.340\n today's learning system,\n\n55:46.340 --> 55:48.940\n they are so vulnerable to the adversarial setting,\n\n55:48.940 --> 55:51.060\n but at the same time, actually we also know\n\n55:51.060 --> 55:53.020\n that even in natural settings,\n\n55:53.020 --> 55:55.580\n these learning systems, they don't generalize well\n\n55:55.580 --> 55:58.100\n and hence they can really misbehave\n\n55:58.100 --> 56:02.300\n under certain situations like what we have seen.\n\n56:02.300 --> 56:04.740\n And hence I think using that as an example,\n\n56:04.740 --> 56:08.260\n it can show that these issues can be real.\n\n56:08.260 --> 56:10.700\n They can be real, but so there's two cases.\n\n56:10.700 --> 56:14.140\n One is something, it's like perturbations\n\n56:14.140 --> 56:16.140\n can make the system misbehave\n\n56:16.140 --> 56:19.300\n versus make the system do one specific thing\n\n56:19.300 --> 56:23.780\n that the attacker wants, as you said, the targeted attack.\n\n56:23.780 --> 56:27.500\n That seems to be very difficult,\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:31.540\n like an extra level of difficult step in the real world.\n\n56:31.540 --> 56:34.500\n But from the perspective of the passenger of the car,\n\n56:35.660 --> 56:38.140\n I don't think it matters either way,\n\n56:38.140 --> 56:42.340\n whether it's misbehavior or a targeted attack.\n\n56:42.340 --> 56:45.260\n And also, and that's why I was also saying earlier,\n\n56:45.260 --> 56:48.740\n like one defense is this multi model defense\n\n56:48.740 --> 56:51.060\n and more of these consistent checks and so on.\n\n56:51.060 --> 56:53.420\n So in the future, I think also it's important\n\n56:53.420 --> 56:56.420\n that for these autonomous vehicles,\n\n56:56.420 --> 56:58.620\n they have lots of different sensors\n\n56:58.620 --> 57:02.620\n and they should be combining all these sensory readings\n\n57:02.620 --> 57:06.860\n to arrive at the decision and the interpretation\n\n57:06.860 --> 57:08.420\n of the world and so on.\n\n57:08.420 --> 57:12.100\n And the more of these sensory inputs they use\n\n57:12.100 --> 57:14.500\n and the better they combine the sensory inputs,\n\n57:14.500 --> 57:16.900\n the harder it is going to be attacked.\n\n57:16.900 --> 57:19.740\n And hence, I think that is a very important direction\n\n57:19.740 --> 57:21.740\n for us to move towards.\n\n57:21.740 --> 57:25.340\n So multi model, multi sensor across multiple cameras,\n\n57:25.340 --> 57:30.060\n but also in the case of car, radar, ultrasonic, sound even.\n\n57:30.060 --> 57:31.380\n So all of those.\n\n57:31.380 --> 57:33.380\n Right, right, right, exactly.\n\n57:33.380 --> 57:36.260\n So another thing, another part of your work\n\n57:36.260 --> 57:39.180\n has been in the space of privacy.\n\n57:39.180 --> 57:40.460\n And that too can be seen\n\n57:40.460 --> 57:43.980\n as a kind of security vulnerability.\n\n57:43.980 --> 57:47.900\n So thinking of data as a thing that should be protected\n\n57:47.900 --> 57:52.140\n and the vulnerabilities to data is vulnerability\n\n57:52.140 --> 57:55.180\n is essentially the thing that you wanna protect\n\n57:55.180 --> 57:56.940\n is the privacy of that data.\n\n57:56.940 --> 57:59.780\n So what do you see as the main vulnerabilities\n\n57:59.780 --> 58:02.260\n in the privacy of data and how do we protect it?\n\n58:02.260 --> 58:05.620\n Right, so in security we actually talk about\n\n58:05.620 --> 58:10.180\n essentially two, in this case, two different properties.\n\n58:10.180 --> 58:13.500\n One is integrity and one is confidentiality.\n\n58:13.500 --> 58:17.220\n So what we have been talking earlier\n\n58:17.220 --> 58:20.660\n is essentially the integrity of,\n\n58:20.660 --> 58:22.860\n the integrity property of the learning system.\n\n58:22.860 --> 58:24.820\n How to make sure that the learning system\n\n58:24.820 --> 58:29.020\n is giving the right prediction, for example.\n\n58:29.020 --> 58:32.300\n And privacy essentially is on the other side\n\n58:32.300 --> 58:34.900\n is about confidentiality of the system\n\n58:34.900 --> 58:37.260\n is how attackers can,\n\n58:37.260 --> 58:39.620\n when the attackers compromise\n\n58:39.620 --> 58:42.460\n the confidentiality of the system,\n\n58:42.460 --> 58:45.220\n that's when the attacker steal sensitive information,\n\n58:46.220 --> 58:48.500\n right, about individuals and so on.\n\n58:48.500 --> 58:51.380\n That's really clean, those are great terms.\n\n58:51.380 --> 58:53.580\n Integrity and confidentiality.\n\n58:53.580 --> 58:54.420\n Right.\n\n58:54.420 --> 58:58.700\n So how, what are the main vulnerabilities to privacy,\n\n58:58.700 --> 59:01.660\n would you say, and how do we protect against it?\n\n59:01.660 --> 59:04.580\n Like what are the main spaces and problems\n\n59:04.580 --> 59:07.140\n that you think about in the context of privacy?\n\n59:07.140 --> 59:11.460\n Right, so especially in the machine learning setting.\n\n59:12.620 --> 59:16.980\n So in this case, as we know that how the process goes\n\n59:16.980 --> 59:19.860\n is that we have the training data\n\n59:19.860 --> 59:23.220\n and then the machine learning system trains\n\n59:23.220 --> 59:26.020\n from this training data and then builds a model\n\n59:26.020 --> 59:29.460\n and then later on inputs are given to the model\n\n59:29.460 --> 59:34.260\n to, at inference time, to try to get prediction and so on.\n\n59:34.260 --> 59:38.540\n So then in this case, the privacy concerns that we have\n\n59:38.540 --> 59:43.340\n is typically about privacy of the data in the training data\n\n59:43.340 --> 59:45.780\n because that's essentially the private information.\n\n59:45.780 --> 59:49.980\n So, and it's really important\n\n59:49.980 --> 59:52.300\n because oftentimes the training data\n\n59:52.300 --> 59:54.140\n can be very sensitive.\n\n59:54.140 --> 59:57.180\n It can be your financial data, it's your health data,\n\n59:57.180 --> 59:59.740\n or like in IoT case,\n\n59:59.740 --> 1:00:03.420\n it's the sensors deployed in real world environment\n\n1:00:03.420 --> 1:00:04.260\n and so on.\n\n1:00:04.260 --> 1:00:08.500\n And all this can be collecting very sensitive information.\n\n1:00:08.500 --> 1:00:11.220\n And all the sensitive information gets fed\n\n1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:13.740\n into the learning system and trains.\n\n1:00:13.740 --> 1:00:16.660\n And as we know, these neural networks,\n\n1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:19.380\n they can have really high capacity\n\n1:00:19.380 --> 1:00:23.180\n and they actually can remember a lot.\n\n1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:25.300\n And hence just from the learning,\n\n1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:27.580\n the learned model in the end,\n\n1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:31.900\n actually attackers can potentially infer information\n\n1:00:31.900 --> 1:00:36.860\n about the original training data sets.\n\n1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:38.460\n So the thing you're trying to protect\n\n1:00:38.460 --> 1:00:42.820\n that is the confidentiality of the training data.\n\n1:00:42.820 --> 1:00:44.620\n And so what are the methods for doing that?\n\n1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:46.220\n Would you say, what are the different ways\n\n1:00:46.220 --> 1:00:47.780\n that can be done?\n\n1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:49.620\n And also we can talk about essentially\n\n1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:54.620\n how the attacker may try to learn information from the...\n\n1:00:54.620 --> 1:00:57.740\n So, and also there are different types of attacks.\n\n1:00:57.740 --> 1:01:01.220\n So in certain cases, again, like in white box attacks,\n\n1:01:01.220 --> 1:01:03.860\n we can see that the attacker actually get to see\n\n1:01:03.860 --> 1:01:05.660\n the parameters of the model.\n\n1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:08.780\n And then from that, a smart attacker potentially\n\n1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:11.380\n can try to figure out information\n\n1:01:11.380 --> 1:01:13.940\n about the training data set.\n\n1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:16.900\n They can try to figure out what type of data\n\n1:01:16.900 --> 1:01:18.660\n has been in the training data sets.\n\n1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:21.380\n And sometimes they can tell like,\n\n1:01:21.380 --> 1:01:23.940\n whether a person has been...\n\n1:01:23.940 --> 1:01:27.220\n A particular person's data point has been used\n\n1:01:27.220 --> 1:01:29.060\n in the training data sets as well.\n\n1:01:29.060 --> 1:01:31.940\n So white box, meaning you have access to the parameters\n\n1:01:31.940 --> 1:01:33.540\n of say a neural network.\n\n1:01:33.540 --> 1:01:36.580\n And so that you're saying that it's some...\n\n1:01:36.580 --> 1:01:38.860\n Given that information is possible to some...\n\n1:01:38.860 --> 1:01:40.380\n So I can give you some examples.\n\n1:01:40.380 --> 1:01:41.780\n And then another type of attack,\n\n1:01:41.780 --> 1:01:46.180\n which is even easier to carry out is not a white box model.\n\n1:01:46.180 --> 1:01:49.900\n It's more of just a query model where the attacker\n\n1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:52.580\n only gets to query the machine learning model\n\n1:01:52.580 --> 1:01:55.340\n and then try to steal sensitive information\n\n1:01:55.340 --> 1:01:57.020\n in the original training data.\n\n1:01:57.020 --> 1:01:59.500\n So, right, so I can give you an example.\n\n1:02:00.580 --> 1:02:03.700\n In this case, training a language model.\n\n1:02:03.700 --> 1:02:06.300\n So in our work, in collaboration\n\n1:02:06.300 --> 1:02:08.100\n with the researchers from Google,\n\n1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:10.660\n we actually studied the following question.\n\n1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:13.620\n So at high level, the question is,\n\n1:02:13.620 --> 1:02:15.900\n as we mentioned, the neural networks\n\n1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:18.860\n can have very high capacity and they could be remembering\n\n1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:21.620\n a lot from the training process.\n\n1:02:21.620 --> 1:02:25.500\n Then the question is, can attacker actually exploit this\n\n1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:28.660\n and try to actually extract sensitive information\n\n1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:31.140\n in the original training data sets\n\n1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:34.220\n through just querying the learned model\n\n1:02:34.220 --> 1:02:37.140\n without even knowing the parameters of the model,\n\n1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:38.780\n like the details of the model\n\n1:02:38.780 --> 1:02:41.900\n or the architectures of the model and so on.\n\n1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:46.860\n So that's a question we set out to explore.\n\n1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:50.860\n And in one of the case studies, we showed the following.\n\n1:02:50.860 --> 1:02:55.060\n So we trained a language model over an email data set.\n\n1:02:55.060 --> 1:02:57.420\n It's called an Enron email data set.\n\n1:02:57.420 --> 1:03:01.180\n And the Enron email data sets naturally contained\n\n1:03:01.180 --> 1:03:04.460\n users social security numbers and credit card numbers.\n\n1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:08.500\n So we trained a language model over the data sets\n\n1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:11.180\n and then we showed that an attacker\n\n1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:13.220\n by devising some new attacks\n\n1:03:13.220 --> 1:03:15.940\n by just querying the language model\n\n1:03:15.940 --> 1:03:19.140\n and without knowing the details of the model,\n\n1:03:19.140 --> 1:03:23.020\n the attacker actually can extract\n\n1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:26.980\n the original social security numbers and credit card numbers\n\n1:03:26.980 --> 1:03:30.300\n that were in the original training data sets.\n\n1:03:30.300 --> 1:03:33.300\n So get the most sensitive personally identifiable information\n\n1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:36.180\n from the data set from just querying it.\n\n1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:39.260\n Right, yeah.\n\n1:03:39.260 --> 1:03:42.820\n So that's an example showing that's why\n\n1:03:42.820 --> 1:03:45.940\n even as we train machine learning models,\n\n1:03:45.940 --> 1:03:48.300\n we have to be really careful\n\n1:03:48.300 --> 1:03:51.580\n with protecting users data privacy.\n\n1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:53.740\n So what are the mechanisms for protecting?\n\n1:03:53.740 --> 1:03:55.740\n Is there hopeful?\n\n1:03:55.740 --> 1:03:58.940\n So there's been recent work on differential privacy,\n\n1:03:58.940 --> 1:04:02.660\n for example, that provides some hope,\n\n1:04:02.660 --> 1:04:04.460\n but can you describe some of the ideas?\n\n1:04:04.460 --> 1:04:05.580\n Right, so that's actually, right.\n\n1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:09.780\n So that's also our finding is that by actually,\n\n1:04:09.780 --> 1:04:12.500\n we show that in this particular case,\n\n1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:14.300\n we actually have a good defense.\n\n1:04:14.300 --> 1:04:17.820\n For the querying case, for the language model case.\n\n1:04:17.820 --> 1:04:22.820\n So instead of just training a vanilla language model,\n\n1:04:23.020 --> 1:04:26.620\n instead, if we train a differentially private language model,\n\n1:04:26.620 --> 1:04:30.100\n then we can still achieve similar utility,\n\n1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:34.580\n but at the same time, we can actually significantly enhance\n\n1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:39.420\n the privacy protection of the learned model.\n\n1:04:39.420 --> 1:04:44.020\n And our proposed attacks actually are no longer effective.\n\n1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:47.180\n And differential privacy is a mechanism\n\n1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:49.100\n of adding some noise,\n\n1:04:49.100 --> 1:04:52.620\n by which you then have some guarantees on the inability\n\n1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:57.620\n to figure out the presence of a particular person\n\n1:04:58.820 --> 1:04:59.860\n in the dataset.\n\n1:04:59.860 --> 1:05:01.860\n So right, so in this particular case,\n\n1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:05.500\n what the differential privacy mechanism does\n\n1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:09.500\n is that it actually adds perturbation\n\n1:05:09.500 --> 1:05:10.700\n in the training process.\n\n1:05:10.700 --> 1:05:12.980\n As we know, during the training process,\n\n1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:16.860\n we are learning the model, we are doing gradient updates,\n\n1:05:16.860 --> 1:05:19.020\n the weight updates and so on.\n\n1:05:19.020 --> 1:05:22.620\n And essentially, differential privacy,\n\n1:05:22.620 --> 1:05:26.340\n a differentially private machine learning algorithm\n\n1:05:26.340 --> 1:05:29.660\n in this case, will be adding noise\n\n1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:33.860\n and adding various perturbation during this training process.\n\n1:05:33.860 --> 1:05:35.780\n To some aspect of the training process.\n\n1:05:35.780 --> 1:05:39.660\n Right, so then the finally trained learning,\n\n1:05:39.660 --> 1:05:42.500\n the learned model is differentially private,\n\n1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:46.660\n and so it can enhance the privacy protection.\n\n1:05:46.660 --> 1:05:50.340\n So okay, so that's the attacks and the defense of privacy.\n\n1:05:51.420 --> 1:05:54.340\n You also talk about ownership of data.\n\n1:05:54.340 --> 1:05:56.580\n So this is a really interesting idea\n\n1:05:56.580 --> 1:05:59.060\n that we get to use many services online\n\n1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:04.060\n for seemingly for free by essentially,\n\n1:06:04.100 --> 1:06:06.820\n sort of a lot of companies are funded through advertisement.\n\n1:06:06.820 --> 1:06:09.820\n And what that means is the advertisement works\n\n1:06:09.820 --> 1:06:12.060\n exceptionally well because the companies are able\n\n1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:13.700\n to access our personal data,\n\n1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:16.260\n so they know which advertisement to service\n\n1:06:16.260 --> 1:06:18.980\n to do targeted advertisements and so on.\n\n1:06:18.980 --> 1:06:21.860\n So can you maybe talk about this?\n\n1:06:21.860 --> 1:06:26.220\n You have some nice paintings of the future,\n\n1:06:26.220 --> 1:06:28.580\n philosophically speaking future\n\n1:06:28.580 --> 1:06:31.780\n where people can have a little bit more control\n\n1:06:31.780 --> 1:06:33.140\n of their data by owning\n\n1:06:33.140 --> 1:06:36.900\n and maybe understanding the value of their data\n\n1:06:36.900 --> 1:06:40.500\n and being able to sort of monetize it\n\n1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:43.460\n in a more explicit way as opposed to the implicit way\n\n1:06:43.460 --> 1:06:45.100\n that it's currently done.\n\n1:06:45.100 --> 1:06:47.420\n Yeah, I think this is a fascinating topic\n\n1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:50.100\n and also a really complex topic.\n\n1:06:51.100 --> 1:06:53.860\n Right, I think there are these natural questions,\n\n1:06:53.860 --> 1:06:57.020\n who should be owning the data?\n\n1:06:58.620 --> 1:07:03.220\n And so I can draw one analogy.\n\n1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:06.820\n So for example, for physical properties,\n\n1:07:06.820 --> 1:07:08.340\n like your house and so on.\n\n1:07:08.340 --> 1:07:13.180\n So really this notion of property rights\n\n1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:17.220\n it's not like from day one,\n\n1:07:17.220 --> 1:07:20.620\n we knew that there should be like this clear notion\n\n1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:25.420\n of ownership of properties and having enforcement for this.\n\n1:07:25.420 --> 1:07:29.180\n And so actually people have shown\n\n1:07:29.180 --> 1:07:34.180\n that this establishment and enforcement of property rights\n\n1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:42.180\n has been a main driver for the economy earlier.\n\n1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:47.180\n And that actually really propelled the economic growth\n\n1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:50.420\n even in the earlier stage.\n\n1:07:50.420 --> 1:07:53.020\n So throughout the history of the development\n\n1:07:53.020 --> 1:07:56.180\n of the United States or actually just civilization,\n\n1:07:56.180 --> 1:07:59.620\n the idea of property rights that you can own property.\n\n1:07:59.620 --> 1:08:01.340\n Right, and then there's enforcement.\n\n1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:04.540\n There's institutional rights,\n\n1:08:04.540 --> 1:08:07.740\n that governmental like enforcements of this\n\n1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:12.020\n actually has been a key driver for economic growth.\n\n1:08:12.020 --> 1:08:16.420\n And there had been even research or proposals saying\n\n1:08:16.420 --> 1:08:18.820\n that for a lot of the developing countries,\n\n1:08:22.540 --> 1:08:25.100\n essentially the challenge in growth\n\n1:08:25.100 --> 1:08:28.940\n is not actually due to the lack of capital.\n\n1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:33.940\n It's more due to the lack of this notion of property rights\n\n1:08:34.500 --> 1:08:37.060\n and the enforcement of property rights.\n\n1:08:37.060 --> 1:08:41.580\n Interesting, so that the presence of absence\n\n1:08:41.580 --> 1:08:45.060\n of both the concept of the property rights\n\n1:08:45.060 --> 1:08:48.100\n and their enforcement has a strong correlation\n\n1:08:48.100 --> 1:08:49.820\n to economic growth.\n\n1:08:49.820 --> 1:08:50.740\n Right, right.\n\n1:08:50.740 --> 1:08:54.100\n And so you think that that same could be transferred\n\n1:08:54.100 --> 1:08:56.220\n to the idea of property ownership\n\n1:08:56.220 --> 1:08:57.860\n in the case of data ownership.\n\n1:08:57.860 --> 1:09:01.260\n I think first of all, it's a good lesson for us\n\n1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:06.260\n to recognize that these rights and the recognition\n\n1:09:06.540 --> 1:09:10.020\n and the enforcements of these type of rights\n\n1:09:10.020 --> 1:09:13.220\n is very, very important for economic growth.\n\n1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:15.740\n And then if we look at where we are now\n\n1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:18.460\n and where we are going in the future,\n\n1:09:18.460 --> 1:09:19.780\n so essentially more and more\n\n1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:23.540\n is actually moving into the digital world.\n\n1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:26.260\n And also more and more, I would say,\n\n1:09:26.260 --> 1:09:30.380\n even information or assets of a person\n\n1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:33.180\n is more and more into the real world,\n\n1:09:33.180 --> 1:09:35.780\n the physical, sorry, the digital world as well.\n\n1:09:35.780 --> 1:09:39.900\n It's the data that the person has generated.\n\n1:09:39.900 --> 1:09:43.020\n And essentially it's like in the past\n\n1:09:43.020 --> 1:09:45.860\n what defines a person, you can say,\n\n1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:50.860\n right, like oftentimes besides the innate capabilities,\n\n1:09:50.940 --> 1:09:54.260\n actually it's the physical properties.\n\n1:09:54.260 --> 1:09:55.300\n House, car.\n\n1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:56.740\n Right, that defines a person.\n\n1:09:56.740 --> 1:09:59.540\n But I think more and more people start to realize\n\n1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:01.420\n actually what defines a person\n\n1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:03.020\n is more important in the data\n\n1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:04.860\n that the person has generated\n\n1:10:04.860 --> 1:10:06.380\n or the data about the person.\n\n1:10:07.540 --> 1:10:10.500\n Like all the way from your political views,\n\n1:10:10.500 --> 1:10:14.980\n your music taste and your financial information,\n\n1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:16.820\n a lot of these and your health.\n\n1:10:16.820 --> 1:10:20.140\n So more and more of the definition of the person\n\n1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:22.100\n is actually in the digital world.\n\n1:10:22.100 --> 1:10:26.220\n And currently for the most part, that's owned implicitly.\n\n1:10:26.220 --> 1:10:27.300\n People don't talk about it,\n\n1:10:27.300 --> 1:10:32.300\n but kind of it's owned by internet companies.\n\n1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:34.580\n So it's not owned by individuals.\n\n1:10:34.580 --> 1:10:39.060\n Right, there's no clear notion of ownership of such data.\n\n1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:41.820\n And also we talk about privacy and so on,\n\n1:10:41.820 --> 1:10:45.540\n but I think actually clearly identifying the ownership\n\n1:10:45.540 --> 1:10:46.580\n is a first step.\n\n1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:48.300\n Once you identify the ownership,\n\n1:10:48.300 --> 1:10:50.660\n then you can say who gets to define\n\n1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:52.300\n how the data should be used.\n\n1:10:52.300 --> 1:10:57.300\n So maybe some users are fine with internet companies\n\n1:10:57.580 --> 1:11:02.020\n serving them as, right, using their data\n\n1:11:02.020 --> 1:11:05.740\n as long as if the data is used in a certain way\n\n1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:10.740\n that actually the user consents with or allows.\n\n1:11:11.460 --> 1:11:14.460\n For example, you can see the recommendation system\n\n1:11:14.460 --> 1:11:16.700\n in some sense, we don't call it as,\n\n1:11:16.700 --> 1:11:18.340\n but a recommendation system,\n\n1:11:18.340 --> 1:11:20.740\n similarly it's trying to recommend you something\n\n1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:23.980\n and users enjoy and can really benefit\n\n1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:25.620\n from good recommendation systems,\n\n1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:29.340\n either recommending you better music, movies, news,\n\n1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:30.940\n even research papers to read.\n\n1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:35.780\n But of course then in these targeted ads,\n\n1:11:35.780 --> 1:11:40.420\n especially in certain cases where people can be manipulated\n\n1:11:40.420 --> 1:11:44.140\n by these targeted ads that can have really bad,\n\n1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:45.700\n like severe consequences.\n\n1:11:45.700 --> 1:11:50.340\n So essentially users want their data to be used\n\n1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:53.380\n to better serve them and also maybe even, right,\n\n1:11:53.380 --> 1:11:56.340\n get paid for or whatever, like in different settings.\n\n1:11:56.340 --> 1:11:57.740\n But the thing is that first of all,\n\n1:11:57.740 --> 1:12:02.740\n we need to really establish like who needs to decide,\n\n1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:06.180\n who can decide how the data should be used.\n\n1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:10.060\n And typically the establishment and clarification\n\n1:12:10.060 --> 1:12:12.100\n of the ownership will help this\n\n1:12:12.100 --> 1:12:14.660\n and it's an important first step.\n\n1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:16.260\n So if the user is the owner,\n\n1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:18.340\n then naturally the user gets to define\n\n1:12:18.340 --> 1:12:19.940\n how the data should be used.\n\n1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:22.580\n But if you even say that wait a minute,\n\n1:12:22.580 --> 1:12:24.420\n users are actually now the owner of this data,\n\n1:12:24.420 --> 1:12:26.700\n whoever is collecting the data is the owner of the data.\n\n1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:28.180\n Now of course they get to use the data\n\n1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:29.940\n however way they want.\n\n1:12:29.940 --> 1:12:33.900\n So to really address these complex issues,\n\n1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:35.940\n we need to go at the root cause.\n\n1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:40.940\n So it seems fairly clear that so first we really need to say\n\n1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:42.540\n that who is the owner of the data\n\n1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:45.100\n and then the owners can specify\n\n1:12:45.100 --> 1:12:47.140\n how they want their data to be utilized.\n\n1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:49.580\n So that's a fascinating,\n\n1:12:50.980 --> 1:12:52.620\n most people don't think about that\n\n1:12:52.620 --> 1:12:54.940\n and I think that's a fascinating thing to think about\n\n1:12:54.940 --> 1:12:57.140\n and probably fight for it.\n\n1:12:57.140 --> 1:12:59.620\n I can only see in the economic growth argument,\n\n1:12:59.620 --> 1:13:01.020\n it's probably a really strong one.\n\n1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:04.220\n So that's a first time I'm kind of at least thinking\n\n1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:08.100\n about the positive aspect of that ownership\n\n1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:11.220\n being the longterm growth of the economy,\n\n1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:12.260\n so good for everybody.\n\n1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:15.500\n But sort of one down possible downside I could see\n\n1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:20.500\n sort of to put on my grumpy old grandpa hat\n\n1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:25.860\n and it's really nice for Facebook and YouTube and Twitter\n\n1:13:25.860 --> 1:13:27.100\n to all be free.\n\n1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:31.660\n And if you give control to people or their data,\n\n1:13:31.660 --> 1:13:34.780\n do you think it's possible they will be,\n\n1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:37.620\n they would not want to hand it over quite easily?\n\n1:13:37.620 --> 1:13:42.220\n And so a lot of these companies that rely on mass handover\n\n1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:45.980\n of data and then therefore provide a mass\n\n1:13:46.900 --> 1:13:51.020\n seemingly free service would then completely,\n\n1:13:51.020 --> 1:13:56.020\n so the way the internet looks will completely change\n\n1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:57.660\n because of the ownership of data\n\n1:13:57.660 --> 1:14:00.700\n and we'll lose a lot of services value.\n\n1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:02.340\n Do you worry about that?\n\n1:14:02.340 --> 1:14:03.740\n That's a very good question.\n\n1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:06.060\n I think that's not necessarily the case\n\n1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:10.060\n in the sense that yes, users can have ownership\n\n1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:12.860\n of their data, they can maintain control of their data,\n\n1:14:12.860 --> 1:14:17.500\n but also then they get to decide how their data can be used.\n\n1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:19.900\n So that's why I mentioned earlier,\n\n1:14:19.900 --> 1:14:23.500\n so in this case, if they feel that they enjoy the benefits\n\n1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.460\n of social networks and so on,\n\n1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:29.540\n and they're fine with having Facebook, having their data,\n\n1:14:29.540 --> 1:14:33.940\n but utilizing the data in certain way that they agree,\n\n1:14:33.940 --> 1:14:37.220\n then they can still enjoy the free services.\n\n1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:40.020\n But for others, maybe they would prefer\n\n1:14:40.020 --> 1:14:41.980\n some kind of private vision.\n\n1:14:41.980 --> 1:14:44.540\n And in that case, maybe they can even opt in\n\n1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:47.860\n to say that I want to pay and to have,\n\n1:14:47.860 --> 1:14:50.780\n so for example, it's already fairly standard,\n\n1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:53.460\n like you pay for certain subscriptions\n\n1:14:53.460 --> 1:14:58.460\n so that you don't get to be shown ads, right?\n\n1:14:59.140 --> 1:15:01.980\n So then users essentially can have choices.\n\n1:15:01.980 --> 1:15:06.300\n And I think we just want to essentially bring out\n\n1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:10.820\n more about who gets to decide what to do with that data.\n\n1:15:10.820 --> 1:15:11.940\n I think it's an interesting idea,\n\n1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:13.620\n because if you poll people now,\n\n1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:16.780\n it seems like, I don't know,\n\n1:15:16.780 --> 1:15:19.140\n but subjectively, sort of anecdotally speaking,\n\n1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:22.100\n it seems like a lot of people don't trust Facebook.\n\n1:15:22.100 --> 1:15:24.380\n So that's at least a very popular thing to say\n\n1:15:24.380 --> 1:15:26.940\n that I don't trust Facebook, right?\n\n1:15:26.940 --> 1:15:30.460\n I wonder if you give people control of their data\n\n1:15:30.460 --> 1:15:33.140\n as opposed to sort of signaling to everyone\n\n1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:34.860\n that they don't trust Facebook,\n\n1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:37.900\n I wonder how they would speak with the actual,\n\n1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:42.460\n like would they be willing to pay $10 a month for Facebook\n\n1:15:42.460 --> 1:15:44.860\n or would they hand over their data?\n\n1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:47.500\n It'd be interesting to see what fraction of people\n\n1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:51.300\n would quietly hand over their data to Facebook\n\n1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:52.620\n to make it free.\n\n1:15:52.620 --> 1:15:54.860\n I don't have a good intuition about that.\n\n1:15:54.860 --> 1:15:57.580\n Like how many people, do you have an intuition\n\n1:15:57.580 --> 1:16:01.540\n about how many people would use their data effectively\n\n1:16:01.540 --> 1:16:06.540\n on the market of the internet\n\n1:16:06.540 --> 1:16:09.940\n by sort of buying services with their data?\n\n1:16:10.860 --> 1:16:12.380\n Yeah, so that's a very good question.\n\n1:16:12.380 --> 1:16:15.900\n I think, so one thing I also want to mention\n\n1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:20.900\n is that this, right, so it seems that especially in press,\n\n1:16:22.780 --> 1:16:26.020\n the conversation has been very much like\n\n1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:29.100\n two sides fighting against each other.\n\n1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:33.500\n On one hand, right, users can say that, right,\n\n1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:35.420\n they don't trust Facebook, they don't,\n\n1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:37.580\n or they delete Facebook.\n\n1:16:37.580 --> 1:16:39.140\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:16:39.140 --> 1:16:44.140\n Right, and then on the other hand, right, of course,\n\n1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:48.220\n right, the other side, they also feel,\n\n1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:50.700\n oh, they are providing a lot of services to users\n\n1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:52.780\n and users are getting it all for free.\n\n1:16:53.780 --> 1:16:57.580\n So I think I actually, I don't know,\n\n1:16:57.580 --> 1:17:00.700\n I talk a lot to like different companies\n\n1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:02.740\n and also like basically on both sides.\n\n1:17:04.820 --> 1:17:07.660\n So one thing I hope also like,\n\n1:17:07.660 --> 1:17:09.180\n this is my hope for this year also,\n\n1:17:09.180 --> 1:17:14.180\n is that we want to establish a more constructive dialogue\n\n1:17:16.820 --> 1:17:18.660\n and to help people to understand\n\n1:17:18.660 --> 1:17:21.860\n that the problem is much more nuanced\n\n1:17:21.860 --> 1:17:25.500\n than just this two sides fighting.\n\n1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:30.500\n Because naturally, there is a tension between the two sides,\n\n1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:33.460\n between utility and privacy.\n\n1:17:33.460 --> 1:17:36.300\n So if you want to get more utility, essentially,\n\n1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:40.620\n like the recommendation system example I gave earlier,\n\n1:17:40.620 --> 1:17:43.500\n if you want someone to give you a good recommendation,\n\n1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:45.220\n essentially, whatever that system is,\n\n1:17:45.220 --> 1:17:48.580\n the system is going to need to know your data\n\n1:17:48.580 --> 1:17:50.620\n to give you a good recommendation.\n\n1:17:52.020 --> 1:17:53.820\n But also, of course, at the same time,\n\n1:17:53.820 --> 1:17:56.660\n we want to ensure that however that data is being handled,\n\n1:17:56.660 --> 1:17:59.500\n it's done in a privacy preserving way.\n\n1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:02.460\n So that, for example, the recommendation system\n\n1:18:02.460 --> 1:18:05.500\n doesn't just go around and sell your data\n\n1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:10.500\n and then cause a lot of bad consequences and so on.\n\n1:18:12.580 --> 1:18:15.020\n So you want that dialogue to be a little bit more\n\n1:18:15.020 --> 1:18:18.220\n in the open, a little more nuanced,\n\n1:18:18.220 --> 1:18:20.700\n and maybe adding control to the data,\n\n1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:24.020\n ownership to the data will allow,\n\n1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:26.220\n as opposed to this happening in the background,\n\n1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:28.100\n allow to bring it to the forefront\n\n1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:32.300\n and actually have dialogues, like more nuanced,\n\n1:18:32.300 --> 1:18:37.300\n real dialogues about how we trade our data for the services.\n\n1:18:37.300 --> 1:18:38.140\n That's the hope.\n\n1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:41.020\n Right, right, yes, at the high level.\n\n1:18:41.020 --> 1:18:42.980\n So essentially, also knowing that there are\n\n1:18:42.980 --> 1:18:47.980\n technical challenges in addressing the issue,\n\n1:18:47.980 --> 1:18:50.300\n like basically you can't have,\n\n1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:53.260\n just like the example that I gave earlier,\n\n1:18:53.260 --> 1:18:55.580\n it's really difficult to balance the two\n\n1:18:55.580 --> 1:18:57.460\n between utility and privacy.\n\n1:18:57.460 --> 1:19:01.980\n And that's also a lot of things that I work on,\n\n1:19:01.980 --> 1:19:03.860\n my group works on as well,\n\n1:19:03.860 --> 1:19:08.860\n is to actually develop these technologies that are needed\n\n1:19:08.860 --> 1:19:12.220\n to essentially help this balance better,\n\n1:19:12.220 --> 1:19:14.660\n essentially to help data to be utilized\n\n1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:16.420\n in a privacy preserving way.\n\n1:19:16.420 --> 1:19:19.340\n And so we essentially need people to understand\n\n1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:22.300\n the challenges and also at the same time\n\n1:19:22.300 --> 1:19:26.180\n to provide the technical abilities\n\n1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:29.540\n and also regulatory frameworks to help the two sides\n\n1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:33.020\n to be more in a win win situation instead of a fight.\n\n1:19:33.020 --> 1:19:36.980\n Yeah, the fighting thing is,\n\n1:19:36.980 --> 1:19:38.740\n I think YouTube and Twitter and Facebook\n\n1:19:38.740 --> 1:19:41.460\n are providing an incredible service to the world\n\n1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:44.260\n and they're all making a lot of money\n\n1:19:44.260 --> 1:19:47.460\n and they're all making mistakes, of course,\n\n1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:49.500\n but they're doing an incredible job\n\n1:19:50.740 --> 1:19:53.500\n that I think deserves to be applauded\n\n1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:55.580\n and there's some degree of,\n\n1:19:55.580 --> 1:19:59.260\n like it's a cool thing that's created\n\n1:19:59.260 --> 1:20:04.260\n and it shouldn't be monolithically fought against,\n\n1:20:04.340 --> 1:20:06.540\n like Facebook is evil or so on.\n\n1:20:06.540 --> 1:20:07.980\n Yeah, it might make mistakes,\n\n1:20:07.980 --> 1:20:10.100\n but I think it's an incredible service.\n\n1:20:10.100 --> 1:20:12.420\n I think it's world changing.\n\n1:20:12.420 --> 1:20:16.620\n I mean, I think Facebook's done a lot of incredible,\n\n1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:20.900\n incredible things by bringing, for example, identity.\n\n1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:25.220\n Like allowing people to be themselves,\n\n1:20:25.220 --> 1:20:28.660\n like their real selves in the digital space\n\n1:20:28.660 --> 1:20:31.620\n by using their real name and their real picture.\n\n1:20:31.620 --> 1:20:34.220\n That step was like the first step from the real world\n\n1:20:34.220 --> 1:20:35.700\n to the digital world.\n\n1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:38.020\n That was a huge step that perhaps will define\n\n1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:41.580\n the 21st century in us creating a digital identity.\n\n1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:44.180\n And there's a lot of interesting possibilities there\n\n1:20:44.180 --> 1:20:45.260\n that are positive.\n\n1:20:45.260 --> 1:20:47.900\n Of course, some things that are negative\n\n1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:50.100\n and having a good dialogue about that is great.\n\n1:20:50.100 --> 1:20:51.660\n And I'm great that people like you\n\n1:20:51.660 --> 1:20:54.180\n are at the center of that dialogue, so that's awesome.\n\n1:20:54.180 --> 1:20:58.500\n Right, I think also, I also can understand.\n\n1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:00.780\n I think actually in the past,\n\n1:21:00.780 --> 1:21:02.740\n especially in the past couple of years,\n\n1:21:03.740 --> 1:21:07.540\n this rising awareness has been helpful.\n\n1:21:07.540 --> 1:21:10.220\n Like users are also more and more recognizing\n\n1:21:10.220 --> 1:21:12.020\n that privacy is important to them.\n\n1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:14.460\n They should, maybe, right,\n\n1:21:14.460 --> 1:21:15.860\n they should be owners of their data.\n\n1:21:15.860 --> 1:21:18.260\n I think this definitely is very helpful.\n\n1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:23.260\n And I think also this type of voice also,\n\n1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:27.260\n and together with the regulatory framework and so on,\n\n1:21:27.260 --> 1:21:31.220\n also help the companies to essentially put\n\n1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:33.940\n these type of issues at a higher priority.\n\n1:21:33.940 --> 1:21:38.940\n And knowing that, right, also it is their responsibility too\n\n1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:42.860\n to ensure that users are well protected.\n\n1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:47.260\n So I think definitely the rising voice is super helpful.\n\n1:21:47.260 --> 1:21:50.420\n And I think that actually really has brought\n\n1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:52.660\n the issue of data privacy\n\n1:21:52.660 --> 1:21:55.740\n and even this consideration of data ownership\n\n1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:59.620\n to the forefront to really much wider community.\n\n1:22:00.860 --> 1:22:03.140\n And I think more of this voice is needed,\n\n1:22:03.140 --> 1:22:05.140\n but I think it's just that we want to have\n\n1:22:05.140 --> 1:22:10.020\n a more constructive dialogue to bring the both sides together\n\n1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:12.300\n to figure out a constructive solution.\n\n1:22:13.740 --> 1:22:15.180\n So another interesting space\n\n1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:16.620\n where security is really important\n\n1:22:16.620 --> 1:22:20.820\n is in the space of any kinds of transactions,\n\n1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:22.940\n but it could be also digital currency.\n\n1:22:22.940 --> 1:22:27.860\n So can you maybe talk a little bit about blockchain?\n\n1:22:27.860 --> 1:22:30.060\n And can you tell me what is a blockchain?\n\n1:22:30.060 --> 1:22:32.900\n Blockchain.\n\n1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:34.940\n I think the blockchain word itself\n\n1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:37.580\n is actually very overloaded.\n\n1:22:37.580 --> 1:22:38.420\n Of course.\n\n1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:39.260\n In general.\n\n1:22:39.260 --> 1:22:40.100\n It's like AI.\n\n1:22:40.100 --> 1:22:42.020\n Right, yes.\n\n1:22:42.020 --> 1:22:43.340\n So in general, when we talk about blockchain,\n\n1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:47.780\n we refer to this distributor in a decentralized fashion.\n\n1:22:47.780 --> 1:22:52.780\n So essentially you have a community of nodes\n\n1:22:53.460 --> 1:22:54.860\n that come together.\n\n1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:59.180\n And even though each one may not be trusted,\n\n1:22:59.180 --> 1:23:02.620\n and as long as a certain thresholds\n\n1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:07.580\n of the set of nodes behaves properly,\n\n1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:11.820\n then the system can essentially achieve certain properties.\n\n1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:15.580\n For example, in the distributed ledger setting,\n\n1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:18.540\n you can maintain an immutable log\n\n1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:22.940\n and you can ensure that, for example,\n\n1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:25.540\n the transactions actually are agreed upon\n\n1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:28.260\n and then it's immutable and so on.\n\n1:23:28.260 --> 1:23:29.740\n So first of all, what's a ledger?\n\n1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:30.740\n So it's a...\n\n1:23:30.740 --> 1:23:31.740\n It's like a database.\n\n1:23:31.740 --> 1:23:33.660\n It's like a data entry.\n\n1:23:33.660 --> 1:23:35.140\n And so a distributed ledger\n\n1:23:35.140 --> 1:23:37.900\n is something that's maintained across\n\n1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:41.700\n or is synchronized across multiple sources, multiple nodes.\n\n1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:43.340\n Multiple nodes, yes.\n\n1:23:43.340 --> 1:23:46.060\n And so where is this idea?\n\n1:23:46.060 --> 1:23:48.420\n How do you keep...\n\n1:23:48.420 --> 1:23:51.420\n So it's important, a ledger, a database,\n\n1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:55.580\n to keep that, to make sure...\n\n1:23:55.580 --> 1:23:58.740\n So what are the kinds of security vulnerabilities\n\n1:23:58.740 --> 1:24:01.540\n that you're trying to protect against\n\n1:24:01.540 --> 1:24:04.460\n in the context of a distributed ledger?\n\n1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:06.300\n So in this case, for example,\n\n1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:09.100\n you don't want some malicious nodes\n\n1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:12.860\n to be able to change the transaction logs.\n\n1:24:12.860 --> 1:24:15.700\n And in certain cases, it's called double spending,\n\n1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:19.820\n like you can also cause different views\n\n1:24:19.820 --> 1:24:22.820\n in different parts of the network and so on.\n\n1:24:22.820 --> 1:24:24.500\n So the ledger has to represent,\n\n1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:27.580\n if you're capturing financial transactions,\n\n1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:29.460\n it has to represent the exact timing\n\n1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:32.420\n and the exact occurrence and no duplicates,\n\n1:24:32.420 --> 1:24:33.380\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:37.100\n It has to represent what actually happened.\n\n1:24:37.100 --> 1:24:40.540\n Okay, so what are your thoughts\n\n1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:43.820\n on the security and privacy of digital currency?\n\n1:24:43.820 --> 1:24:47.340\n I can't tell you how many people write to me\n\n1:24:47.340 --> 1:24:51.660\n to interview various people in the digital currency space.\n\n1:24:51.660 --> 1:24:54.940\n There seems to be a lot of excitement there.\n\n1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:57.980\n And it seems to be, some of it's, to me,\n\n1:24:57.980 --> 1:25:01.860\n from an outsider's perspective, seems like dark magic.\n\n1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:06.020\n I don't know how secure...\n\n1:25:06.020 --> 1:25:08.900\n I think the foundation, from my perspective,\n\n1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:13.460\n of digital currencies, that is, you can't trust anyone.\n\n1:25:13.460 --> 1:25:16.340\n So you have to create a really secure system.\n\n1:25:16.340 --> 1:25:19.860\n So can you maybe speak about how,\n\n1:25:19.860 --> 1:25:22.060\n what your thoughts in general about digital currency is\n\n1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:26.940\n and how we can possibly create financial transactions\n\n1:25:26.940 --> 1:25:31.740\n and financial stores of money in the digital space?\n\n1:25:31.740 --> 1:25:35.220\n So you asked about security and privacy.\n\n1:25:35.220 --> 1:25:37.580\n So again, as I mentioned earlier,\n\n1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:40.620\n in security, we actually talk about two main properties,\n\n1:25:42.020 --> 1:25:45.860\n the integrity and confidentiality.\n\n1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:49.020\n So there's another one for availability.\n\n1:25:49.020 --> 1:25:50.660\n You want the system to be available.\n\n1:25:50.660 --> 1:25:52.740\n But here, for the question you asked,\n\n1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:57.100\n let's just focus on integrity and confidentiality.\n\n1:25:57.100 --> 1:26:00.540\n So for integrity of this distributed ledger,\n\n1:26:00.540 --> 1:26:01.980\n essentially, as we discussed,\n\n1:26:01.980 --> 1:26:04.940\n we want to ensure that the different nodes,\n\n1:26:06.860 --> 1:26:08.580\n so they have this consistent view,\n\n1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:13.140\n usually it's done through what we call a consensus protocol,\n\n1:26:13.140 --> 1:26:18.140\n and that they establish this shared view on this ledger,\n\n1:26:18.140 --> 1:26:21.900\n and that you cannot go back and change,\n\n1:26:21.900 --> 1:26:24.380\n it's immutable, and so on.\n\n1:26:25.260 --> 1:26:28.700\n So in this case, then the security often refers\n\n1:26:28.700 --> 1:26:31.820\n to this integrity property.\n\n1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:34.660\n And essentially, you're asking the question,\n\n1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:38.860\n how much work, how can you attack the system\n\n1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:43.860\n so that the attacker can change the lock, for example?\n\n1:26:43.860 --> 1:26:46.220\n Change the lock, for example.\n\n1:26:46.220 --> 1:26:48.540\n Right, how hard is it to make an attack like that?\n\n1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:49.460\n Right, right.\n\n1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:54.460\n And then that very much depends on the consensus mechanism,\n\n1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:57.580\n how the system is built, and all that.\n\n1:26:57.580 --> 1:26:59.140\n So there are different ways\n\n1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:02.860\n to build these decentralized systems.\n\n1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:05.660\n And people may have heard about the terms called\n\n1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:07.860\n like proof of work, proof of stake,\n\n1:27:07.860 --> 1:27:09.700\n these different mechanisms.\n\n1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:14.420\n And it really depends on how the system has been built,\n\n1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:17.820\n and also how much resources,\n\n1:27:17.820 --> 1:27:20.500\n how much work has gone into the network\n\n1:27:20.500 --> 1:27:24.460\n to actually say how secure it is.\n\n1:27:24.460 --> 1:27:26.660\n So for example, people talk about like,\n\n1:27:26.660 --> 1:27:28.860\n in Bitcoin, it's proof of work system,\n\n1:27:28.860 --> 1:27:32.060\n so much electricity has been burned.\n\n1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:35.300\n So there's differences in the different mechanisms\n\n1:27:35.300 --> 1:27:37.940\n and the implementations of a distributed ledger\n\n1:27:37.940 --> 1:27:40.060\n used for digital currency.\n\n1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:42.380\n So there's Bitcoin, there's whatever,\n\n1:27:42.380 --> 1:27:43.300\n there's so many of them,\n\n1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:46.020\n and there's underlying different mechanisms.\n\n1:27:46.020 --> 1:27:48.420\n And there's arguments, I suppose,\n\n1:27:48.420 --> 1:27:51.620\n about which is more effective, which is more secure,\n\n1:27:51.620 --> 1:27:52.940\n which is more.\n\n1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:54.940\n And what is needed,\n\n1:27:54.940 --> 1:27:56.980\n what amount of resources needed\n\n1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:00.300\n to be able to attack the system?\n\n1:28:00.300 --> 1:28:02.860\n Like for example, what percentage of the nodes\n\n1:28:02.860 --> 1:28:06.220\n do you need to control or compromise\n\n1:28:06.220 --> 1:28:09.980\n in order to, right, to change the log?\n\n1:28:09.980 --> 1:28:12.860\n And those are things, do you have a sense\n\n1:28:12.860 --> 1:28:15.460\n if those are things that can be shown theoretically\n\n1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:17.580\n through the design of the mechanisms,\n\n1:28:17.580 --> 1:28:19.220\n or does it have to be shown empirically\n\n1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:23.540\n by having a large number of users using the currency?\n\n1:28:23.540 --> 1:28:24.380\n I see.\n\n1:28:24.380 --> 1:28:27.020\n So in general, for each consensus mechanism,\n\n1:28:27.020 --> 1:28:30.180\n you can actually show theoretically\n\n1:28:30.180 --> 1:28:34.420\n what is needed to be able to attack the system.\n\n1:28:34.420 --> 1:28:37.940\n Of course, there can be different types of attacks\n\n1:28:37.940 --> 1:28:41.180\n as we discussed at the beginning.\n\n1:28:41.180 --> 1:28:45.620\n And so that it's difficult to give\n\n1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:50.100\n like, you know, complete estimates,\n\n1:28:50.100 --> 1:28:55.100\n like really how much is needed to compromise the system.\n\n1:28:55.340 --> 1:28:57.700\n But in general, right, so there are ways to say\n\n1:28:57.700 --> 1:29:00.620\n what percentage of the nodes you need to compromise\n\n1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:03.140\n and so on.\n\n1:29:03.140 --> 1:29:07.460\n So we talked about integrity on the security side,\n\n1:29:07.460 --> 1:29:11.180\n and then you also mentioned the privacy\n\n1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:13.460\n or the confidentiality side.\n\n1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:17.780\n Does it have some of the same problems\n\n1:29:17.780 --> 1:29:19.420\n and therefore some of the same solutions\n\n1:29:19.420 --> 1:29:21.500\n that you talked about on the machine learning side\n\n1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:23.300\n with differential privacy and so on?\n\n1:29:24.180 --> 1:29:29.180\n Yeah, so actually in general on the public ledger\n\n1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:33.500\n in these public decentralized systems,\n\n1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:34.940\n actually nothing is private.\n\n1:29:34.940 --> 1:29:38.620\n So all the transactions posted on the ledger,\n\n1:29:38.620 --> 1:29:40.020\n anybody can see.\n\n1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:43.540\n So in that sense, there's no confidentiality.\n\n1:29:43.540 --> 1:29:46.980\n So usually what you can do is then\n\n1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:50.700\n there are the mechanisms that you can build in\n\n1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:55.220\n to enable confidentiality or privacy of the transactions\n\n1:29:55.220 --> 1:29:56.340\n and the data and so on.\n\n1:29:56.340 --> 1:30:00.900\n That's also some of the work that both my group\n\n1:30:00.900 --> 1:30:04.500\n and also my startup does as well.\n\n1:30:04.500 --> 1:30:05.580\n What's the name of the startup?\n\n1:30:05.580 --> 1:30:06.620\n Oasis Labs.\n\n1:30:06.620 --> 1:30:07.660\n Oasis Labs.\n\n1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:11.980\n And so the confidentiality aspect there\n\n1:30:11.980 --> 1:30:15.380\n is even though the transactions are public,\n\n1:30:15.380 --> 1:30:18.260\n you wanna keep some aspect confidential\n\n1:30:18.260 --> 1:30:21.100\n of the identity of the people involved in the transactions?\n\n1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:25.260\n Or what is their hope to keep confidential in this context?\n\n1:30:25.260 --> 1:30:26.740\n So in this case, for example,\n\n1:30:26.740 --> 1:30:31.620\n you want to enable like confidential transactions,\n\n1:30:31.620 --> 1:30:36.620\n even, so there are different essentially types of data\n\n1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:40.900\n that you want to keep private or confidential.\n\n1:30:40.900 --> 1:30:43.220\n And you can utilize different technologies\n\n1:30:43.220 --> 1:30:45.340\n including zero knowledge proofs\n\n1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:50.340\n and also secure computing and techniques\n\n1:30:50.340 --> 1:30:55.340\n and to hide who is making the transactions to whom\n\n1:30:56.580 --> 1:30:58.300\n and the transaction amount.\n\n1:30:58.300 --> 1:31:00.860\n And in our case, also we can enable\n\n1:31:00.860 --> 1:31:02.980\n like confidential smart contracts.\n\n1:31:02.980 --> 1:31:06.020\n And so that you don't know the data\n\n1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:09.500\n and the execution of the smart contract and so on.\n\n1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:14.180\n And we actually are combining these different technologies\n\n1:31:14.180 --> 1:31:20.340\n and going back to the earlier discussion we had,\n\n1:31:20.340 --> 1:31:26.180\n enabling like ownership of data and privacy of data and so on.\n\n1:31:26.180 --> 1:31:29.620\n So at Oasis Labs, we're actually building\n\n1:31:29.620 --> 1:31:33.180\n what we call a platform for responsible data economy\n\n1:31:33.180 --> 1:31:36.380\n to actually combine these different technologies together\n\n1:31:36.380 --> 1:31:41.380\n and to enable secure and privacy preserving computation\n\n1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:48.380\n and also using the library to help provide immutable log\n\n1:31:48.380 --> 1:31:51.060\n of users ownership to their data\n\n1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:54.620\n and the policies they want the data to adhere to,\n\n1:31:54.620 --> 1:31:56.420\n the usage of the data to adhere to\n\n1:31:56.420 --> 1:31:59.500\n and also how the data has been utilized.\n\n1:31:59.500 --> 1:32:02.340\n So all this together can build,\n\n1:32:02.340 --> 1:32:06.020\n we call a distributed secure computing fabric\n\n1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:10.060\n that helps to enable a more responsible data economy.\n\n1:32:10.060 --> 1:32:11.620\n So it's a lot of things together.\n\n1:32:11.620 --> 1:32:13.860\n Yeah, wow, that was eloquent.\n\n1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:17.140\n Okay, you're involved in so much amazing work\n\n1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:18.540\n that we'll never be able to get to,\n\n1:32:18.540 --> 1:32:22.860\n but I have to ask at least briefly about program synthesis,\n\n1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:26.780\n which at least in a philosophical sense captures\n\n1:32:26.780 --> 1:32:30.580\n much of the dreams of what's possible in computer science\n\n1:32:30.580 --> 1:32:32.460\n and the artificial intelligence.\n\n1:32:33.860 --> 1:32:36.660\n First, let me ask, what is program synthesis\n\n1:32:36.660 --> 1:32:41.180\n and can neural networks be used to learn programs from data?\n\n1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:43.100\n So can this be learned?\n\n1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:46.540\n Some aspect of the synthesis can it be learned?\n\n1:32:46.540 --> 1:32:49.660\n So program synthesis is about teaching computers\n\n1:32:49.660 --> 1:32:52.860\n to write code, to program.\n\n1:32:52.860 --> 1:32:57.860\n And I think that's one of our ultimate dreams or goals.\n\n1:33:00.180 --> 1:33:05.340\n I think Andreessen talked about software eating the world.\n\n1:33:05.340 --> 1:33:10.340\n So I say, once we teach computers to write the software,\n\n1:33:10.620 --> 1:33:13.460\n how to write programs, then I guess computers\n\n1:33:13.460 --> 1:33:16.140\n will be eating the world by transitivity.\n\n1:33:16.140 --> 1:33:17.700\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:33:17.700 --> 1:33:21.180\n So yeah, and also for me actually,\n\n1:33:23.460 --> 1:33:28.460\n when I shifted from security to more AI machine learning,\n\n1:33:28.980 --> 1:33:30.420\n program synthesis is,\n\n1:33:31.700 --> 1:33:33.700\n program synthesis and adversarial machine learning,\n\n1:33:33.700 --> 1:33:38.100\n these are the two fields that I particularly focus on.\n\n1:33:38.100 --> 1:33:40.340\n Like program synthesis is one of the first questions\n\n1:33:40.340 --> 1:33:42.740\n that I actually started investigating.\n\n1:33:42.740 --> 1:33:46.460\n Just as a question, oh, I guess from the security side,\n\n1:33:46.460 --> 1:33:49.340\n there's a, you're looking for holes in programs,\n\n1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:51.380\n so at least see small connection,\n\n1:33:51.380 --> 1:33:55.380\n but where was your interest for program synthesis?\n\n1:33:56.420 --> 1:33:58.380\n Because it's such a fascinating, such a big,\n\n1:33:58.380 --> 1:34:01.020\n such a hard problem in the general case.\n\n1:34:01.020 --> 1:34:03.100\n Why program synthesis?\n\n1:34:03.100 --> 1:34:06.860\n So the reason for that is actually when I shifted my focus\n\n1:34:06.860 --> 1:34:11.580\n from security into AI machine learning,\n\n1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:15.300\n actually one of my main motivation at the time\n\n1:34:16.220 --> 1:34:19.020\n is that even though I have been doing a lot of work\n\n1:34:19.020 --> 1:34:20.020\n in security and privacy,\n\n1:34:20.020 --> 1:34:22.580\n but I have always been fascinated\n\n1:34:22.580 --> 1:34:26.540\n about building intelligent machines.\n\n1:34:26.540 --> 1:34:30.100\n And that was really my main motivation\n\n1:34:30.100 --> 1:34:32.180\n to spend more time in AI machine learning\n\n1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:35.140\n is that I really want to figure out\n\n1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:37.860\n how we can build intelligent machines.\n\n1:34:37.860 --> 1:34:42.860\n And to help us towards that goal,\n\n1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:45.500\n program synthesis is really one of,\n\n1:34:45.500 --> 1:34:49.420\n I would say the best domain to work on.\n\n1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:52.260\n I actually call it like program synthesis\n\n1:34:52.260 --> 1:34:54.980\n is like the perfect playground\n\n1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:57.460\n for building intelligent machines\n\n1:34:57.460 --> 1:34:59.940\n and for artificial general intelligence.\n\n1:34:59.940 --> 1:35:03.300\n Yeah, well, it's also in that sense,\n\n1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:04.140\n not just a playground,\n\n1:35:04.140 --> 1:35:06.860\n I guess it's the ultimate test of intelligence\n\n1:35:06.860 --> 1:35:11.860\n because I think if you can generate sort of neural networks\n\n1:35:13.300 --> 1:35:15.740\n can learn good functions\n\n1:35:15.740 --> 1:35:19.100\n and they can help you out in classification tasks,\n\n1:35:19.100 --> 1:35:21.740\n but to be able to write programs,\n\n1:35:21.740 --> 1:35:24.860\n that's the epitome from the machine side.\n\n1:35:24.860 --> 1:35:26.700\n That's the same as passing the Turing test\n\n1:35:26.700 --> 1:35:29.300\n in natural language, but with programs,\n\n1:35:29.300 --> 1:35:32.060\n it's able to express complicated ideas\n\n1:35:32.060 --> 1:35:37.060\n to reason through ideas and boil them down to algorithms.\n\n1:35:38.020 --> 1:35:39.420\n Yes, exactly, exactly.\n\n1:35:39.420 --> 1:35:41.700\n Incredible, so can this be learned?\n\n1:35:41.700 --> 1:35:43.460\n How far are we?\n\n1:35:43.460 --> 1:35:44.740\n Is there hope?\n\n1:35:44.740 --> 1:35:46.700\n What are the open challenges?\n\n1:35:46.700 --> 1:35:48.220\n Yeah, very good questions.\n\n1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:51.220\n We are still at an early stage,\n\n1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:56.300\n but already I think we have seen a lot of progress.\n\n1:35:56.300 --> 1:35:59.940\n I mean, definitely we have existence proof,\n\n1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:02.020\n just like humans can write programs.\n\n1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:05.740\n So there's no reason why computers cannot write programs.\n\n1:36:05.740 --> 1:36:08.740\n So I think that's definitely an achievable goal\n\n1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:11.380\n is just how long it takes.\n\n1:36:11.380 --> 1:36:16.380\n And even today, we actually have,\n\n1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:19.700\n the program synthesis community,\n\n1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:22.740\n especially the program synthesis via learning,\n\n1:36:22.740 --> 1:36:24.820\n how we call it, neuro program synthesis community,\n\n1:36:24.820 --> 1:36:28.500\n is still very small, but the community has been growing\n\n1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:31.740\n and we have seen a lot of progress.\n\n1:36:31.740 --> 1:36:36.740\n And in limited domains, I think actually program synthesis\n\n1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:40.420\n is ripe for real world applications.\n\n1:36:41.300 --> 1:36:42.580\n So actually it was quite amazing.\n\n1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:47.580\n I was giving a talk, so here is a rework conference.\n\n1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:50.340\n Rework Deep Learning Summit.\n\n1:36:50.340 --> 1:36:52.340\n I actually, so I gave another talk\n\n1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:54.860\n at the previous rework conference\n\n1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:56.900\n in deep reinforcement learning.\n\n1:36:56.900 --> 1:37:01.900\n And then I actually met someone from a startup,\n\n1:37:01.980 --> 1:37:04.540\n the CEO of the startup.\n\n1:37:04.540 --> 1:37:06.500\n And then when he saw my name, he recognized it.\n\n1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:11.500\n And he actually said, one of our papers actually had,\n\n1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:17.740\n they had actually become a key products in their startup.\n\n1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:22.740\n And that was program synthesis, in that particular case,\n\n1:37:22.740 --> 1:37:25.220\n it was natural language translation,\n\n1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:30.220\n translating natural language description into SQL queries.\n\n1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:34.020\n Oh, wow, that direction, okay.\n\n1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:37.820\n Right, so yeah, so in program synthesis,\n\n1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:40.860\n in limited domains, in well specified domains,\n\n1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:45.860\n actually already we can see really,\n\n1:37:45.860 --> 1:37:50.860\n really great progress and applicability in the real world.\n\n1:37:52.140 --> 1:37:54.700\n So domains like, I mean, as an example,\n\n1:37:54.700 --> 1:37:55.860\n you said natural language,\n\n1:37:55.860 --> 1:37:59.260\n being able to express something through just normal language\n\n1:37:59.260 --> 1:38:03.140\n and it converts it into a database SQL query.\n\n1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:03.980\n Right.\n\n1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:07.660\n And that's how solved of a problem is that?\n\n1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:10.380\n Because that seems like a really hard problem.\n\n1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:14.940\n Again, in limited domains, actually it can work pretty well.\n\n1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:18.820\n And now this is also a very active domain of research.\n\n1:38:18.820 --> 1:38:21.460\n At the time, I think when he saw our paper at the time,\n\n1:38:21.460 --> 1:38:25.660\n we were the state of the arts on that task.\n\n1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:29.100\n And since then, actually now there has been more work\n\n1:38:29.100 --> 1:38:34.100\n and with even more like sophisticated data sets.\n\n1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:38.820\n And so, but I think I wouldn't be surprised\n\n1:38:38.820 --> 1:38:41.020\n that more of this type of technology\n\n1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:43.260\n really gets into the real world.\n\n1:38:43.260 --> 1:38:44.300\n That's exciting.\n\n1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:45.220\n In the near term.\n\n1:38:45.220 --> 1:38:47.700\n Being able to learn in the space of programs\n\n1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:49.820\n is super exciting.\n\n1:38:49.820 --> 1:38:53.100\n I still, yeah, I'm still skeptical\n\n1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:54.860\n cause I think it's a really hard problem,\n\n1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:56.620\n but I would love to see progress.\n\n1:38:56.620 --> 1:38:58.500\n And also I think in terms of the,\n\n1:38:58.500 --> 1:39:00.580\n you asked about open challenges.\n\n1:39:00.580 --> 1:39:04.260\n I think the domain is full of challenges\n\n1:39:04.260 --> 1:39:06.740\n and in particular also we want to see\n\n1:39:06.740 --> 1:39:09.900\n how we should measure the progress in the space.\n\n1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:14.900\n And I would say mainly three main, I would say, metrics.\n\n1:39:16.740 --> 1:39:18.660\n So one is the complexity of the program\n\n1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:20.020\n that we can synthesize.\n\n1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:22.740\n And that will actually have clear measures\n\n1:39:22.740 --> 1:39:25.860\n and just look at the past publications.\n\n1:39:25.860 --> 1:39:27.380\n And even like, for example,\n\n1:39:27.380 --> 1:39:30.300\n I was at the recent NeurIPS conference.\n\n1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:33.780\n Now there's actually fairly sizable like session\n\n1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:35.900\n dedicated to program synthesis, which is...\n\n1:39:35.900 --> 1:39:37.340\n Or even Neural programs.\n\n1:39:37.340 --> 1:39:38.980\n Right, right, right, which is great.\n\n1:39:38.980 --> 1:39:43.140\n And we continue to see the increase.\n\n1:39:43.140 --> 1:39:44.380\n What does sizable mean?\n\n1:39:44.380 --> 1:39:49.380\n I like the word sizable, it's five people.\n\n1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:54.380\n It's still a small community, but it is growing.\n\n1:39:54.380 --> 1:39:58.580\n And they will all win Turing Awards one day, I like it.\n\n1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:02.700\n Right, so we can clearly see an increase\n\n1:40:02.700 --> 1:40:07.260\n in the complexity of the programs that these...\n\n1:40:07.260 --> 1:40:09.020\n We can synthesize.\n\n1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:12.420\n Sorry, is it the complexity of the actual text\n\n1:40:12.420 --> 1:40:15.340\n of the program or the running time complexity?\n\n1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:17.220\n Which complexity are we...\n\n1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:18.060\n How...\n\n1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:21.660\n The complexity of the task to be synthesized\n\n1:40:21.660 --> 1:40:24.540\n and the complexity of the actual synthesized programs.\n\n1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:27.820\n So the lines of code even, for example.\n\n1:40:27.820 --> 1:40:28.660\n Okay, I got you.\n\n1:40:28.660 --> 1:40:32.860\n But it's not the theoretical upper bound\n\n1:40:32.860 --> 1:40:35.300\n of the running time of the algorithm kind of thing.\n\n1:40:35.300 --> 1:40:36.620\n Okay, got it.\n\n1:40:36.620 --> 1:40:39.900\n And you can see the complexity decreasing already.\n\n1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:42.060\n Oh, no, meaning we want to be able to synthesize\n\n1:40:42.060 --> 1:40:44.860\n more and more complex programs, bigger and bigger programs.\n\n1:40:44.860 --> 1:40:49.260\n So we want to see that, we want to increase\n\n1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:50.100\n the complexity of this.\n\n1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:51.380\n I got you, so I have to think through,\n\n1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:53.260\n because I thought of complexity as,\n\n1:40:53.260 --> 1:40:55.540\n you want to be able to accomplish the same task\n\n1:40:55.540 --> 1:40:56.700\n with a simpler and simpler program.\n\n1:40:56.700 --> 1:40:57.540\n I see, I see.\n\n1:40:57.540 --> 1:40:58.820\n No, we are not doing that.\n\n1:40:58.820 --> 1:41:02.420\n It's more about how complex a task\n\n1:41:02.420 --> 1:41:03.940\n we can synthesize programs for.\n\n1:41:03.940 --> 1:41:07.980\n Yeah, got it, being able to synthesize programs,\n\n1:41:07.980 --> 1:41:10.180\n learn them for more and more difficult tasks.\n\n1:41:10.180 --> 1:41:12.740\n So for example, initially, our first work\n\n1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:16.460\n in program synthesis was to translate natural language\n\n1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:19.900\n description into really simple programs called if TTT,\n\n1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:21.380\n if this, then that.\n\n1:41:21.380 --> 1:41:23.700\n So given a trigger condition,\n\n1:41:23.700 --> 1:41:25.700\n what is the action you should take?\n\n1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:28.060\n So that program is super simple.\n\n1:41:28.060 --> 1:41:31.540\n You just identify the trigger conditions and the action.\n\n1:41:31.540 --> 1:41:33.260\n And then later on, with SQL queries,\n\n1:41:33.260 --> 1:41:34.300\n it gets more complex.\n\n1:41:34.300 --> 1:41:37.780\n And then also, we started to synthesize programs\n\n1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:40.020\n with loops and, you know.\n\n1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:43.740\n Oh no, and if you could synthesize recursion,\n\n1:41:43.740 --> 1:41:45.540\n it's all over.\n\n1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:48.540\n Right, actually, one of our works actually\n\n1:41:48.540 --> 1:41:50.940\n is on learning recursive neural programs.\n\n1:41:50.940 --> 1:41:51.780\n Oh no.\n\n1:41:51.780 --> 1:41:53.660\n But anyway, anyway, so that's one is complexity,\n\n1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:58.300\n and the other one is generalization.\n\n1:41:58.300 --> 1:42:03.300\n Like when we train or learn a program synthesizer,\n\n1:42:04.380 --> 1:42:07.740\n in this case, a neural programs to synthesize programs,\n\n1:42:07.740 --> 1:42:10.460\n then you want it to generalize.\n\n1:42:10.460 --> 1:42:13.140\n For a large number of inputs.\n\n1:42:13.140 --> 1:42:15.500\n Right, so to be able to generalize\n\n1:42:15.500 --> 1:42:18.180\n to previously unseen inputs.\n\n1:42:18.180 --> 1:42:19.020\n Got it.\n\n1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:21.620\n And so, right, so some of the work we did earlier\n\n1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:26.180\n on learning recursive neural programs\n\n1:42:26.180 --> 1:42:29.580\n actually showed that recursion\n\n1:42:29.580 --> 1:42:32.620\n actually is important to learn.\n\n1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:34.780\n And if you have recursion,\n\n1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:37.780\n then for a certain set of tasks,\n\n1:42:37.780 --> 1:42:39.420\n we can actually show that you can actually\n\n1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:41.100\n have perfect generalization.\n\n1:42:42.100 --> 1:42:44.380\n So, right, so that won the best paperwork awards\n\n1:42:44.380 --> 1:42:46.540\n at ICLR earlier.\n\n1:42:46.540 --> 1:42:50.740\n So that's one example of we want to learn\n\n1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:53.580\n these neural programs that can generalize better.\n\n1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:57.220\n But that works for certain tasks, certain domains,\n\n1:42:57.220 --> 1:43:01.220\n and there's question how we can essentially\n\n1:43:01.220 --> 1:43:06.220\n develop more techniques that can have generalization\n\n1:43:06.780 --> 1:43:10.460\n for a wider set of domains and so on.\n\n1:43:10.460 --> 1:43:11.460\n So that's another area.\n\n1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:15.940\n And then the third challenge I think will,\n\n1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:17.580\n it's not just for programming synthesis,\n\n1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:20.660\n it's also cutting across other fields\n\n1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:24.140\n in machine learning and also including\n\n1:43:24.140 --> 1:43:26.380\n like deep reinforcement learning in particular,\n\n1:43:26.380 --> 1:43:31.380\n is that this adaptation is that we want to be able\n\n1:43:33.420 --> 1:43:38.420\n to learn from the past and tasks and training and so on\n\n1:43:40.300 --> 1:43:42.380\n to be able to solve new tasks.\n\n1:43:42.380 --> 1:43:44.620\n So for example, in program synthesis today,\n\n1:43:45.540 --> 1:43:48.020\n we still are working in the setting\n\n1:43:48.020 --> 1:43:50.420\n where given a particular task,\n\n1:43:50.420 --> 1:43:55.420\n we train the model and to solve this particular task.\n\n1:43:57.660 --> 1:44:00.060\n But that's not how humans work.\n\n1:44:00.060 --> 1:44:03.140\n The whole point is we train a human,\n\n1:44:03.140 --> 1:44:07.460\n then you can then program to solve new tasks.\n\n1:44:07.460 --> 1:44:08.580\n Right, exactly.\n\n1:44:08.580 --> 1:44:10.380\n And just like in deep reinforcement learning,\n\n1:44:10.380 --> 1:44:11.700\n we don't want to just train agent\n\n1:44:11.700 --> 1:44:13.900\n to play a particular game,\n\n1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:19.020\n either it's Atari or it's Go or whatever.\n\n1:44:19.020 --> 1:44:21.580\n We want to train these agents\n\n1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:24.900\n that can essentially extract knowledge\n\n1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:27.020\n from the past learning experience\n\n1:44:27.020 --> 1:44:31.500\n to be able to adapt to new tasks and solve new tasks.\n\n1:44:31.500 --> 1:44:33.580\n And I think this is particularly important\n\n1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:34.740\n for program synthesis.\n\n1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:37.580\n Yeah, that's the whole dream of program synthesis\n\n1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:41.420\n is you're learning a tool that can solve new problems.\n\n1:44:41.420 --> 1:44:42.580\n Right, exactly.\n\n1:44:42.580 --> 1:44:44.940\n And I think that's a particular domain\n\n1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:49.940\n that as a community, we need to put more emphasis on.\n\n1:44:50.460 --> 1:44:54.340\n And I hope that we can make more progress there as well.\n\n1:44:54.340 --> 1:44:55.860\n Awesome.\n\n1:44:55.860 --> 1:44:57.060\n There's a lot more to talk about.\n\n1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:01.500\n Let me ask that you also had a very interesting\n\n1:45:01.500 --> 1:45:04.980\n and we talked about rich representations.\n\n1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:06.740\n You had a rich life journey.\n\n1:45:08.220 --> 1:45:10.100\n You did your bachelor's in China\n\n1:45:10.100 --> 1:45:12.860\n and your master's and PhD in the United States,\n\n1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:15.300\n CMU in Berkeley.\n\n1:45:15.300 --> 1:45:16.780\n Are there interesting differences?\n\n1:45:16.780 --> 1:45:17.740\n I told you I'm Russian.\n\n1:45:17.740 --> 1:45:19.220\n I think there's a lot of interesting difference\n\n1:45:19.220 --> 1:45:21.100\n between Russia and the United States.\n\n1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:24.780\n Are there in your eyes, interesting differences\n\n1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:29.780\n between the two cultures from the silly romantic notion\n\n1:45:30.380 --> 1:45:33.660\n of the spirit of the people to the more practical notion\n\n1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:37.780\n of how research is conducted that you find interesting\n\n1:45:37.780 --> 1:45:42.100\n or useful in your own work of having experienced both?\n\n1:45:42.100 --> 1:45:43.700\n That's a good question.\n\n1:45:43.700 --> 1:45:48.700\n I think, so I studied in China for my undergraduates\n\n1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:54.580\n and that was more than 20 years ago.\n\n1:45:54.580 --> 1:45:56.140\n So it's been a long time.\n\n1:45:57.260 --> 1:45:59.060\n Is there echoes of that time in you?\n\n1:45:59.060 --> 1:46:00.500\n Things have changed a lot.\n\n1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:01.580\n Actually, it's interesting.\n\n1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:04.220\n I think even more so maybe something\n\n1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:08.900\n that's even be more different for my experience\n\n1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:12.340\n than a lot of computer science researchers\n\n1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:14.140\n and practitioners is that,\n\n1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:16.820\n so for my undergrad, I actually studied physics.\n\n1:46:16.820 --> 1:46:18.020\n Nice, very nice.\n\n1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:20.980\n And then I switched to computer science in graduate school.\n\n1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:22.900\n What happened?\n\n1:46:26.900 --> 1:46:29.380\n Is there another possible universe\n\n1:46:29.380 --> 1:46:32.140\n where you could have become a theoretical physicist\n\n1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:34.540\n at Caltech or something like that?\n\n1:46:34.540 --> 1:46:39.340\n That's very possible, some of my undergrad classmates,\n\n1:46:39.340 --> 1:46:41.540\n then they later on studied physics,\n\n1:46:41.540 --> 1:46:45.540\n got their PhD in physics from these schools,\n\n1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:49.500\n from top physics programs.\n\n1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:51.460\n So you switched to, I mean,\n\n1:46:51.460 --> 1:46:55.940\n from that experience of doing physics in your bachelor's,\n\n1:46:55.940 --> 1:46:59.260\n what made you decide to switch to computer science\n\n1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:03.660\n and computer science at arguably the best university,\n\n1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:05.020\n one of the best universities in the world\n\n1:47:05.020 --> 1:47:07.260\n for computer science with Carnegie Mellon,\n\n1:47:07.260 --> 1:47:09.980\n especially for grad school and so on.\n\n1:47:09.980 --> 1:47:13.020\n So what, second only to MIT, just kidding.\n\n1:47:13.020 --> 1:47:17.300\n Okay, I had to throw that in there.\n\n1:47:17.300 --> 1:47:19.420\n No, what was the choice like\n\n1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:22.580\n and what was the move to the United States like?\n\n1:47:22.580 --> 1:47:24.100\n What was that whole transition?\n\n1:47:24.100 --> 1:47:26.980\n And if you remember, if there's still echoes\n\n1:47:26.980 --> 1:47:30.140\n of some of the spirit of the people of China in you\n\n1:47:30.140 --> 1:47:31.500\n in New York.\n\n1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:32.340\n Right, right, yeah.\n\n1:47:32.340 --> 1:47:33.180\n It's like three questions in one.\n\n1:47:33.180 --> 1:47:34.380\n Yes, I know.\n\n1:47:34.380 --> 1:47:35.220\n I'm sorry.\n\n1:47:36.620 --> 1:47:37.540\n No, that's okay.\n\n1:47:38.540 --> 1:47:40.100\n So yes, so I guess, okay,\n\n1:47:40.100 --> 1:47:43.260\n so first transition from physics to computer science.\n\n1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:45.340\n So when I first came to the United States,\n\n1:47:45.340 --> 1:47:49.340\n I was actually in the physics PhD program at Cornell.\n\n1:47:49.340 --> 1:47:50.300\n I was there for one year\n\n1:47:50.300 --> 1:47:52.020\n and then I switched to computer science\n\n1:47:52.020 --> 1:47:55.140\n and then I was in the PhD program at Carnegie Mellon.\n\n1:47:56.220 --> 1:47:59.100\n So, okay, so the reasons for switching.\n\n1:47:59.100 --> 1:48:02.060\n So one thing, so that's why I also mentioned\n\n1:48:02.060 --> 1:48:04.220\n about this difference in backgrounds\n\n1:48:04.220 --> 1:48:08.020\n about having studied physics first in my undergrad.\n\n1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:13.780\n I actually really, I really did enjoy\n\n1:48:13.780 --> 1:48:18.780\n my undergrad's time and education in physics.\n\n1:48:18.780 --> 1:48:21.060\n I think that actually really helped me\n\n1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:25.020\n in my future work in computer science.\n\n1:48:25.020 --> 1:48:26.380\n Actually, even for machine learning,\n\n1:48:26.380 --> 1:48:28.060\n a lot of the machine learning stuff,\n\n1:48:28.060 --> 1:48:29.740\n the core machine learning methods,\n\n1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:31.540\n many of them actually came from physics.\n\n1:48:31.540 --> 1:48:32.380\n Statistical.\n\n1:48:34.580 --> 1:48:39.580\n For honest, most of everything came from physics.\n\n1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:42.700\n Right, but anyway, so when I studied physics,\n\n1:48:42.700 --> 1:48:47.700\n I was, I think I was really attracted to physics.\n\n1:48:49.020 --> 1:48:51.340\n It was, it's really beautiful.\n\n1:48:51.340 --> 1:48:55.820\n And I actually call it, physics is the language of nature.\n\n1:48:55.820 --> 1:49:00.820\n And I actually clearly remember, like, one moment\n\n1:49:01.940 --> 1:49:06.940\n in my undergrads, like I did my undergrad in Tsinghua\n\n1:49:07.260 --> 1:49:09.940\n and I used to study in the library.\n\n1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:14.620\n And I clearly remember, like, one day\n\n1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:19.540\n I was sitting in the library and I was, like,\n\n1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:21.300\n writing on my notes and so on.\n\n1:49:21.300 --> 1:49:24.740\n And I got so excited that I realized\n\n1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:28.340\n that really just from a few simple axioms,\n\n1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:31.780\n a few simple laws, I can derive so much.\n\n1:49:31.780 --> 1:49:34.300\n It's almost like I can derive the rest of the world.\n\n1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:35.980\n Yeah, the rest of the universe.\n\n1:49:35.980 --> 1:49:39.260\n Yes, yes, so that was, like, amazing.\n\n1:49:39.260 --> 1:49:42.100\n Do you think you, have you ever seen\n\n1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:43.500\n or do you think you can rediscover\n\n1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:46.140\n that kind of power and beauty in computer science\n\n1:49:46.140 --> 1:49:46.980\n in the world that you...\n\n1:49:46.980 --> 1:49:49.380\n So, that's very interesting.\n\n1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:51.460\n So that gets to, you know, the transition\n\n1:49:51.460 --> 1:49:53.180\n from physics to computer science.\n\n1:49:53.180 --> 1:49:55.900\n It's quite different.\n\n1:49:55.900 --> 1:50:00.900\n For physics in grad school, actually, things changed.\n\n1:50:01.860 --> 1:50:05.740\n So one is I started to realize that\n\n1:50:05.740 --> 1:50:08.620\n when I started doing research in physics,\n\n1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:11.260\n at the time I was doing theoretical physics.\n\n1:50:11.260 --> 1:50:14.780\n And a lot of it, you still have the beauty,\n\n1:50:14.780 --> 1:50:16.100\n but it's very different.\n\n1:50:16.100 --> 1:50:18.420\n So I had to actually do a lot of the simulation.\n\n1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:20.740\n So essentially I was actually writing,\n\n1:50:20.740 --> 1:50:23.940\n in some cases writing fortune code.\n\n1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:26.380\n Good old fortune, yeah.\n\n1:50:26.380 --> 1:50:31.380\n To actually, right, do simulations and so on.\n\n1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:37.940\n That was not exactly what I enjoyed doing.\n\n1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:47.500\n And also at the time from talking with the senior students,\n\n1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:52.500\n senior students in the program,\n\n1:50:52.500 --> 1:50:55.260\n I realized many of the students actually were going off\n\n1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:57.660\n to like Wall Street and so on.\n\n1:50:58.540 --> 1:51:02.300\n So, and I've always been interested in computer science\n\n1:51:02.300 --> 1:51:06.540\n and actually essentially taught myself\n\n1:51:06.540 --> 1:51:07.860\n the C programming.\n\n1:51:07.860 --> 1:51:08.700\n Program?\n\n1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:09.540\n Right, and so on.\n\n1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:10.900\n At which, when?\n\n1:51:10.900 --> 1:51:12.020\n In college.\n\n1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:12.860\n In college somewhere?\n\n1:51:12.860 --> 1:51:14.180\n In the summer.\n\n1:51:14.180 --> 1:51:19.180\n For fun, physics major, learning to do C programming.\n\n1:51:19.180 --> 1:51:20.020\n Beautiful.\n\n1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:23.540\n Actually it's interesting, in physics at the time,\n\n1:51:23.540 --> 1:51:25.820\n I think now the program probably has changed,\n\n1:51:25.820 --> 1:51:29.940\n but at the time really the only class we had\n\n1:51:29.940 --> 1:51:34.140\n in related to computer science education\n\n1:51:34.140 --> 1:51:36.780\n was introduction to, I forgot,\n\n1:51:36.780 --> 1:51:40.060\n to computer science or computing and Fortran 77.\n\n1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:42.460\n There's a lot of people that still use Fortran.\n\n1:51:42.460 --> 1:51:46.020\n I'm actually, if you're a programmer out there,\n\n1:51:46.020 --> 1:51:49.700\n I'm looking for an expert to talk to about Fortran.\n\n1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:51.740\n They seem to, there's not many,\n\n1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:53.900\n but there's still a lot of people that still use Fortran\n\n1:51:53.900 --> 1:51:56.420\n and still a lot of people that use Cobalt.\n\n1:51:56.420 --> 1:52:00.180\n But anyway, so then I realized,\n\n1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:01.860\n instead of just doing programming\n\n1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:04.180\n for doing simulations and so on,\n\n1:52:04.180 --> 1:52:07.100\n that I may as well just change to computer science.\n\n1:52:07.100 --> 1:52:09.100\n And also one thing I really liked,\n\n1:52:09.100 --> 1:52:11.260\n and that's a key difference between the two,\n\n1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:14.260\n is in computer science it's so much easier\n\n1:52:14.260 --> 1:52:15.980\n to realize your ideas.\n\n1:52:15.980 --> 1:52:19.300\n If you have an idea, you write it up, you code it up,\n\n1:52:19.300 --> 1:52:22.500\n and then you can see it actually, right?\n\n1:52:22.500 --> 1:52:23.820\n Exactly.\n\n1:52:23.820 --> 1:52:26.100\n Running and you can see it.\n\n1:52:26.100 --> 1:52:26.940\n You can bring it to life quickly.\n\n1:52:26.940 --> 1:52:27.940\n Bring it to life.\n\n1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:30.540\n Whereas in physics, if you have a good theory,\n\n1:52:30.540 --> 1:52:33.140\n you have to wait for the experimentalists\n\n1:52:33.140 --> 1:52:35.380\n to do the experiments and to confirm the theory,\n\n1:52:35.380 --> 1:52:38.060\n and things just take so much longer.\n\n1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:42.340\n And also the reason in physics I decided to do\n\n1:52:42.340 --> 1:52:45.700\n theoretical physics was because I had my experience\n\n1:52:45.700 --> 1:52:47.820\n with experimental physics.\n\n1:52:47.820 --> 1:52:50.820\n First, you have to fix the equipment.\n\n1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:54.140\n You spend most of your time fixing the equipment first.\n\n1:52:55.820 --> 1:52:58.140\n Super expensive equipment, so there's a lot of,\n\n1:52:58.140 --> 1:53:00.780\n yeah, you have to collaborate with a lot of people.\n\n1:53:00.780 --> 1:53:01.620\n Takes a long time.\n\n1:53:01.620 --> 1:53:03.500\n Just takes really, right, much longer.\n\n1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:04.340\n Yeah, it's messy.\n\n1:53:04.340 --> 1:53:06.540\n Right, so I decided to switch to computer science.\n\n1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:09.580\n And one thing I think maybe people have realized\n\n1:53:09.580 --> 1:53:11.100\n is that for people who study physics,\n\n1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:13.900\n actually it's very easy for physicists\n\n1:53:13.900 --> 1:53:16.820\n to change to do something else.\n\n1:53:16.820 --> 1:53:19.580\n I think physics provides a really good training.\n\n1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:23.180\n And yeah, so actually it was fairly easy\n\n1:53:23.180 --> 1:53:25.660\n to switch to computer science.\n\n1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:29.780\n But one thing, going back to your earlier question,\n\n1:53:29.780 --> 1:53:31.580\n so one thing I actually did realize,\n\n1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:34.860\n so there is a big difference between computer science\n\n1:53:34.860 --> 1:53:37.460\n and physics, where physics you can derive\n\n1:53:37.460 --> 1:53:41.380\n the whole universe from just a few simple laws.\n\n1:53:41.380 --> 1:53:43.820\n And computer science, given that a lot of it\n\n1:53:43.820 --> 1:53:47.300\n is defined by humans, the systems are defined by humans,\n\n1:53:47.300 --> 1:53:52.300\n and it's artificial, like essentially you create\n\n1:53:53.660 --> 1:53:55.460\n a lot of these artifacts and so on.\n\n1:53:57.620 --> 1:53:58.620\n It's not quite the same.\n\n1:53:58.620 --> 1:54:00.940\n You don't derive the computer systems\n\n1:54:00.940 --> 1:54:03.420\n with just a few simple laws.\n\n1:54:03.420 --> 1:54:07.580\n You actually have to see there is historical reasons\n\n1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:10.340\n why a system is built and designed one way\n\n1:54:10.340 --> 1:54:11.740\n versus the other.\n\n1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:17.100\n There's a lot more complexity, less elegant simplicity\n\n1:54:17.100 --> 1:54:20.020\n of E equals MC squared that kind of reduces everything\n\n1:54:20.020 --> 1:54:23.220\n down to those beautiful fundamental equations.\n\n1:54:23.220 --> 1:54:27.540\n But what about the move from China to the United States?\n\n1:54:27.540 --> 1:54:31.100\n Is there anything that still stays in you\n\n1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:33.700\n that contributes to your work,\n\n1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:36.740\n the fact that you grew up in another culture?\n\n1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:38.780\n So yes, I think especially back then\n\n1:54:38.780 --> 1:54:40.620\n it's very different from now.\n\n1:54:40.620 --> 1:54:45.620\n So now they actually, I see these students\n\n1:54:46.780 --> 1:54:49.260\n coming from China, and even undergrads,\n\n1:54:49.260 --> 1:54:51.380\n actually they speak fluent English.\n\n1:54:51.380 --> 1:54:54.900\n It was just amazing.\n\n1:54:54.900 --> 1:54:59.220\n And they have already understood so much of the culture\n\n1:54:59.220 --> 1:55:00.900\n in the US and so on.\n\n1:55:00.900 --> 1:55:04.260\n It was to you, it was all foreign?\n\n1:55:04.260 --> 1:55:06.660\n It was a very different time.\n\n1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:11.660\n At the time, actually, we didn't even have easy access\n\n1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:16.260\n to email, not to mention about the web.\n\n1:55:16.260 --> 1:55:21.260\n I remember I had to go to specific privileged server rooms\n\n1:55:22.700 --> 1:55:27.700\n to use email, and hence, at the time,\n\n1:55:27.700 --> 1:55:30.660\n at the time we had much less knowledge\n\n1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:32.940\n about the Western world.\n\n1:55:32.940 --> 1:55:35.060\n And actually at the time I didn't know,\n\n1:55:35.060 --> 1:55:38.140\n actually in the US, the West Coast weather\n\n1:55:38.140 --> 1:55:40.100\n is much better than the East Coast.\n\n1:55:40.100 --> 1:55:45.100\n Yeah, things like that, actually.\n\n1:55:45.100 --> 1:55:46.780\n It's very interesting.\n\n1:55:48.780 --> 1:55:50.340\n But now it's so different.\n\n1:55:50.340 --> 1:55:52.020\n At the time, I would say there's also\n\n1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:53.620\n a bigger cultural difference,\n\n1:55:53.620 --> 1:55:58.060\n because there was so much less opportunity\n\n1:55:58.060 --> 1:55:59.300\n for shared information.\n\n1:55:59.300 --> 1:56:02.380\n So it's such a different time and world.\n\n1:56:02.380 --> 1:56:04.540\n So let me ask maybe a sensitive question.\n\n1:56:04.540 --> 1:56:07.100\n I'm not sure, but I think you and I\n\n1:56:07.100 --> 1:56:08.460\n are in similar positions.\n\n1:56:08.460 --> 1:56:13.140\n I've been here for already 20 years as well,\n\n1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:15.420\n and looking at Russia from my perspective,\n\n1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:16.860\n and you looking at China.\n\n1:56:16.860 --> 1:56:19.420\n In some ways, it's a very distant place,\n\n1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:21.020\n because it's changed a lot.\n\n1:56:21.020 --> 1:56:23.020\n But in some ways you still have echoes,\n\n1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:25.180\n you still have knowledge of that place.\n\n1:56:25.180 --> 1:56:27.500\n The question is, China's doing a lot\n\n1:56:27.500 --> 1:56:29.580\n of incredible work in AI.\n\n1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:32.300\n Do you see, please tell me\n\n1:56:32.300 --> 1:56:34.100\n there's an optimistic picture you see\n\n1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:36.180\n where the United States and China\n\n1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:38.340\n can collaborate and sort of grow together\n\n1:56:38.340 --> 1:56:41.380\n in the development of AI towards,\n\n1:56:41.380 --> 1:56:43.380\n there's different values in terms\n\n1:56:43.380 --> 1:56:44.940\n of the role of government and so on,\n\n1:56:44.940 --> 1:56:48.700\n of ethical, transparent, secure systems.\n\n1:56:48.700 --> 1:56:50.900\n We see it differently in the United States\n\n1:56:50.900 --> 1:56:51.940\n a little bit than China,\n\n1:56:51.940 --> 1:56:53.900\n but we're still trying to work it out.\n\n1:56:53.900 --> 1:56:55.580\n Do you see the two countries being able\n\n1:56:55.580 --> 1:56:57.740\n to successfully collaborate and work\n\n1:56:57.740 --> 1:57:01.260\n in a healthy way without sort of fighting\n\n1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:06.220\n and making it an AI arms race kind of situation?\n\n1:57:06.220 --> 1:57:08.220\n Yeah, I believe so.\n\n1:57:08.220 --> 1:57:10.820\n I think science has no border,\n\n1:57:10.820 --> 1:57:15.820\n and the advancement of the technology helps everyone,\n\n1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:18.020\n helps the whole world.\n\n1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:21.700\n And so I certainly hope that the two countries\n\n1:57:21.700 --> 1:57:26.700\n will collaborate, and I certainly believe so.\n\n1:57:26.860 --> 1:57:28.700\n Do you have any reason to believe so\n\n1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:31.260\n except being an optimist?\n\n1:57:32.100 --> 1:57:35.060\n So first, again, like I said, science has no borders.\n\n1:57:35.060 --> 1:57:36.500\n And especially in...\n\n1:57:36.500 --> 1:57:38.260\n Science doesn't know borders?\n\n1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:39.220\n Right.\n\n1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:41.380\n And you believe that will,\n\n1:57:41.380 --> 1:57:44.820\n in the former Soviet Union during the Cold War...\n\n1:57:44.820 --> 1:57:45.940\n So that's, yeah.\n\n1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:47.580\n So that's the other point I was going to mention\n\n1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:51.300\n is that especially in academic research,\n\n1:57:51.300 --> 1:57:52.420\n everything is public.\n\n1:57:52.420 --> 1:57:55.500\n Like we write papers, we open source codes,\n\n1:57:55.500 --> 1:57:59.060\n and all this is in the public domain.\n\n1:57:59.060 --> 1:58:01.340\n It doesn't matter whether the person is in the US,\n\n1:58:01.340 --> 1:58:03.540\n in China, or some other parts of the world.\n\n1:58:04.860 --> 1:58:06.100\n They can go on archive\n\n1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:09.420\n and look at the latest research and results.\n\n1:58:09.420 --> 1:58:11.500\n So that openness gives you hope.\n\n1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:12.500\n Yes. Me too.\n\n1:58:12.500 --> 1:58:15.620\n And that's also how, as a world,\n\n1:58:15.620 --> 1:58:17.220\n we make progress the best.\n\n1:58:17.220 --> 1:58:21.220\n So, I apologize for the romanticized question,\n\n1:58:21.220 --> 1:58:22.620\n but looking back,\n\n1:58:22.620 --> 1:58:26.100\n what would you say was the most transformative moment\n\n1:58:26.100 --> 1:58:28.420\n in your life that\n\n1:58:30.420 --> 1:58:32.900\n maybe made you fall in love with computer science?\n\n1:58:32.900 --> 1:58:33.740\n You said physics.\n\n1:58:33.740 --> 1:58:34.900\n You remember there was a moment\n\n1:58:34.900 --> 1:58:36.220\n where you thought you could derive\n\n1:58:36.220 --> 1:58:37.860\n the entirety of the universe.\n\n1:58:38.740 --> 1:58:40.900\n Was there a moment that you really fell in love\n\n1:58:40.900 --> 1:58:42.740\n with the work you do now,\n\n1:58:42.740 --> 1:58:45.220\n from security to machine learning,\n\n1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:47.420\n to program synthesis?\n\n1:58:47.420 --> 1:58:52.100\n So maybe, as I mentioned, actually, in college,\n\n1:58:52.100 --> 1:58:55.580\n one summer I just taught myself programming in C.\n\n1:58:55.580 --> 1:58:56.420\n Yes.\n\n1:58:56.420 --> 1:58:57.620\n And you just read a book,\n\n1:58:57.620 --> 1:58:59.460\n and then you're like...\n\n1:58:59.460 --> 1:59:01.540\n Don't tell me you fell in love with computer science\n\n1:59:01.540 --> 1:59:02.900\n by programming in C.\n\n1:59:02.900 --> 1:59:05.340\n Remember I mentioned one of the draws\n\n1:59:05.340 --> 1:59:07.900\n for me to computer science is how easy it is\n\n1:59:07.900 --> 1:59:10.060\n to realize your ideas.\n\n1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:13.900\n So once I read a book,\n\n1:59:13.900 --> 1:59:16.940\n I taught myself how to program in C.\n\n1:59:16.940 --> 1:59:19.260\n Immediately, what did I do?\n\n1:59:19.260 --> 1:59:21.300\n I programmed two games.\n\n1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:25.300\n One's just simple, like it's a Go game,\n\n1:59:25.300 --> 1:59:28.260\n like it's a board, you can move the stones and so on.\n\n1:59:28.260 --> 1:59:30.420\n And the other one, I actually programmed a game\n\n1:59:30.420 --> 1:59:32.940\n that's like a 3D Tetris.\n\n1:59:32.940 --> 1:59:35.300\n It turned out to be a super hard game to play.\n\n1:59:35.300 --> 1:59:38.780\n Because instead of just the standard 2D Tetris,\n\n1:59:38.780 --> 1:59:40.700\n it's actually a 3D thing.\n\n1:59:40.700 --> 1:59:42.900\n But I realized, wow,\n\n1:59:42.900 --> 1:59:45.100\n I just had these ideas to try it out,\n\n1:59:45.100 --> 1:59:48.500\n and then, yeah, you can just do it.\n\n1:59:48.500 --> 1:59:53.260\n And so that's when I realized, wow, this is amazing.\n\n1:59:53.260 --> 1:59:55.100\n Yeah, you can create yourself.\n\n1:59:55.100 --> 1:59:57.580\n Yes, yes, exactly.\n\n1:59:57.580 --> 1:59:59.540\n From nothing to something\n\n1:59:59.540 --> 2:00:01.580\n that's actually out in the real world.\n\n2:00:01.580 --> 2:00:02.420\n So let me ask...\n\n2:00:02.420 --> 2:00:03.780\n Right, I think with your own hands.\n\n2:00:03.780 --> 2:00:05.860\n Let me ask a silly question,\n\n2:00:05.860 --> 2:00:07.860\n or maybe the ultimate question.\n\n2:00:07.860 --> 2:00:11.740\n What is to you the meaning of life?\n\n2:00:11.740 --> 2:00:15.140\n What gives your life meaning, purpose,\n\n2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:18.260\n fulfillment, happiness, joy?\n\n2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:21.100\n Okay, these are two different questions.\n\n2:00:21.100 --> 2:00:22.500\n Very different, yeah.\n\n2:00:22.500 --> 2:00:24.900\n It's usually that you ask this question.\n\n2:00:24.900 --> 2:00:28.020\n Maybe this question is probably the question\n\n2:00:28.020 --> 2:00:32.740\n that has followed me and followed my life the most.\n\n2:00:32.740 --> 2:00:34.860\n Have you discovered anything,\n\n2:00:34.860 --> 2:00:37.020\n any satisfactory answer for yourself?\n\n2:00:38.780 --> 2:00:41.620\n Is there something you've arrived at?\n\n2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:44.260\n You know, there's a moment...\n\n2:00:44.260 --> 2:00:46.980\n I've talked to a few people who have faced,\n\n2:00:46.980 --> 2:00:48.740\n for example, a cancer diagnosis,\n\n2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:50.700\n or faced their own mortality,\n\n2:00:50.700 --> 2:00:53.700\n and that seems to change their view of them.\n\n2:00:53.700 --> 2:00:56.580\n It seems to be a catalyst for them\n\n2:00:56.580 --> 2:00:58.460\n removing most of the crap.\n\n2:00:59.460 --> 2:01:02.620\n Of seeing that most of what they've been doing\n\n2:01:02.620 --> 2:01:04.140\n is not that important,\n\n2:01:04.140 --> 2:01:06.740\n and really reducing it into saying, like,\n\n2:01:06.740 --> 2:01:11.580\n here's actually the few things that really give meaning.\n\n2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:14.780\n Mortality is a really powerful catalyst for that,\n\n2:01:14.780 --> 2:01:15.740\n it seems like.\n\n2:01:15.740 --> 2:01:17.860\n Facing mortality, whether it's your parents dying\n\n2:01:17.860 --> 2:01:19.420\n or somebody close to you dying,\n\n2:01:19.420 --> 2:01:22.020\n or facing your own death for whatever reason,\n\n2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:23.460\n or cancer and so on.\n\n2:01:23.460 --> 2:01:26.460\n So yeah, so in my own case,\n\n2:01:26.460 --> 2:01:28.500\n I didn't need to face mortality, too.\n\n2:01:28.500 --> 2:01:33.500\n So try to ask that question.\n\n2:01:35.980 --> 2:01:38.860\n And I think there are a couple things.\n\n2:01:38.860 --> 2:01:42.700\n So one is, like, who should be defining\n\n2:01:42.700 --> 2:01:44.860\n the meaning of your life, right?\n\n2:01:44.860 --> 2:01:49.020\n Is there some kind of even greater things than you\n\n2:01:49.020 --> 2:01:51.580\n who should define the meaning of your life?\n\n2:01:51.580 --> 2:01:53.900\n So for example, when people say that\n\n2:01:53.900 --> 2:01:56.740\n searching the meaning for your life,\n\n2:01:56.740 --> 2:02:00.380\n is there some outside voice,\n\n2:02:00.380 --> 2:02:04.300\n or is there something outside of you\n\n2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:06.020\n who actually tells you, you know...\n\n2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:09.260\n So people talk about, oh, you know,\n\n2:02:09.260 --> 2:02:14.260\n this is what you have been born to do, right?\n\n2:02:14.700 --> 2:02:17.740\n Like, this is your destiny.\n\n2:02:19.700 --> 2:02:21.820\n So who, right, so that's one question,\n\n2:02:21.820 --> 2:02:24.860\n like, who gets to define the meaning of your life?\n\n2:02:24.860 --> 2:02:27.980\n Should you be finding some other things,\n\n2:02:27.980 --> 2:02:30.860\n some other factor to define this for you?\n\n2:02:30.860 --> 2:02:32.380\n Or is something actually,\n\n2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:35.140\n it's just entirely what you define yourself,\n\n2:02:35.140 --> 2:02:37.380\n and it can be very arbitrary.\n\n2:02:37.380 --> 2:02:41.580\n Yeah, so an inner voice or an outer voice,\n\n2:02:41.580 --> 2:02:44.780\n whether it could be spiritual or religious, too, with God,\n\n2:02:44.780 --> 2:02:48.300\n or some other components of the environment outside of you,\n\n2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:50.180\n or just your own voice.\n\n2:02:50.180 --> 2:02:52.420\n Do you have an answer there?\n\n2:02:52.420 --> 2:02:55.020\n So, okay, so for that, I have an answer.\n\n2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:58.460\n And through, you know, the long period of time\n\n2:02:58.460 --> 2:03:00.620\n of thinking and searching,\n\n2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:04.620\n even searching through outsides, right,\n\n2:03:04.620 --> 2:03:08.260\n you know, voices or factors outside of me.\n\n2:03:08.260 --> 2:03:09.740\n So that, I have an answer.\n\n2:03:09.740 --> 2:03:13.060\n I've come to the conclusion and realization\n\n2:03:13.060 --> 2:03:16.860\n that it's you yourself that defines the meaning of life.\n\n2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:20.300\n Yeah, that's a big burden, though, isn't it?\n\n2:03:20.300 --> 2:03:25.300\n I mean, yes and no, right?\n\n2:03:26.020 --> 2:03:28.140\n So then you have the freedom to define it.\n\n2:03:28.140 --> 2:03:29.540\n Yes.\n\n2:03:29.540 --> 2:03:33.020\n And another question is, like,\n\n2:03:33.020 --> 2:03:35.700\n what does it really mean by the meaning of life?\n\n2:03:37.300 --> 2:03:38.140\n Right.\n\n2:03:39.700 --> 2:03:44.060\n And also, whether the question even makes sense.\n\n2:03:45.420 --> 2:03:49.580\n Absolutely, and you said it somehow distinct from happiness.\n\n2:03:49.580 --> 2:03:51.660\n So meaning is something much deeper\n\n2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:55.020\n than just any kind of emotional,\n\n2:03:55.020 --> 2:03:57.580\n any kind of contentment or joy or whatever.\n\n2:03:57.580 --> 2:03:58.940\n It might be much deeper.\n\n2:03:58.940 --> 2:04:02.580\n And then you have to ask, what is deeper than that?\n\n2:04:02.580 --> 2:04:04.620\n What is there at all?\n\n2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:07.780\n And then the question starts being silly.\n\n2:04:07.780 --> 2:04:09.540\n Right, and also you can say it's deeper,\n\n2:04:09.540 --> 2:04:10.940\n but you can also say it's shallower,\n\n2:04:10.940 --> 2:04:13.500\n depending on how people want to define\n\n2:04:13.500 --> 2:04:14.700\n the meaning of their life.\n\n2:04:14.700 --> 2:04:16.460\n So for example, most people don't even think\n\n2:04:16.460 --> 2:04:17.620\n about this question.\n\n2:04:17.620 --> 2:04:19.540\n Then the meaning of life to them\n\n2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:22.020\n doesn't really matter that much.\n\n2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:24.740\n And also, whether knowing the meaning of life,\n\n2:04:26.340 --> 2:04:28.940\n whether it actually helps your life to be better\n\n2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:31.140\n or whether it helps your life to be happier,\n\n2:04:31.140 --> 2:04:34.500\n these actually are open questions.\n\n2:04:34.500 --> 2:04:36.140\n It's not, right?\n\n2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:37.700\n Of course, most questions are open.\n\n2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:40.180\n I tend to think that just asking the question,\n\n2:04:40.180 --> 2:04:42.740\n as you mentioned, as you've done for a long time,\n\n2:04:42.740 --> 2:04:44.900\n is the only, that there is no answer.\n\n2:04:44.900 --> 2:04:47.620\n And asking the question is a really good exercise.\n\n2:04:47.620 --> 2:04:49.100\n I mean, I have this, for me personally,\n\n2:04:49.100 --> 2:04:54.100\n I've had a kind of feeling that creation is,\n\n2:04:56.140 --> 2:04:58.140\n like for me has been very fulfilling.\n\n2:04:58.140 --> 2:05:00.820\n And it seems like my meaning has been to create.\n\n2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:02.100\n And I'm not sure what that is.\n\n2:05:02.100 --> 2:05:05.220\n Like I don't have, I'm single and I don't have kids.\n\n2:05:05.220 --> 2:05:08.940\n I'd love to have kids, but I also, sounds creepy,\n\n2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:13.340\n but I also see sort of, you said see programs.\n\n2:05:13.340 --> 2:05:15.660\n I see programs as little creations.\n\n2:05:15.660 --> 2:05:17.940\n I see robots as little creations.\n\n2:05:19.060 --> 2:05:22.660\n I think those bring, and then ideas,\n\n2:05:22.660 --> 2:05:25.140\n theorems are creations.\n\n2:05:25.140 --> 2:05:28.780\n And those somehow intrinsically, like you said,\n\n2:05:28.780 --> 2:05:29.620\n bring me joy.\n\n2:05:29.620 --> 2:05:31.740\n I think they do to a lot of, at least scientists,\n\n2:05:31.740 --> 2:05:34.180\n but I think they do to a lot of people.\n\n2:05:34.180 --> 2:05:37.300\n So that, to me, if I had to force the answer to that,\n\n2:05:37.300 --> 2:05:42.300\n I would say creating new things yourself.\n\n2:05:43.180 --> 2:05:44.020\n For you.\n\n2:05:44.020 --> 2:05:45.500\n For me, for me, for me.\n\n2:05:45.500 --> 2:05:48.580\n I don't know, but like you said, it keeps changing.\n\n2:05:48.580 --> 2:05:49.900\n Is there some answer that?\n\n2:05:49.900 --> 2:05:52.300\n And some people, they can, I think,\n\n2:05:52.300 --> 2:05:54.380\n they may say it's experience, right?\n\n2:05:54.380 --> 2:05:56.460\n Like their meaning of life,\n\n2:05:56.460 --> 2:05:57.740\n they just want to experience\n\n2:05:57.740 --> 2:05:59.940\n to the richest and fullest they can.\n\n2:05:59.940 --> 2:06:02.700\n And a lot of people do take that path.\n\n2:06:02.700 --> 2:06:05.540\n Yes, seeing life as actually a collection of moments\n\n2:06:05.540 --> 2:06:10.540\n and then trying to make the richest possible sets,\n\n2:06:10.740 --> 2:06:13.940\n fill those moments with the richest possible experiences.\n\n2:06:13.940 --> 2:06:14.780\n Right.\n\n2:06:14.780 --> 2:06:16.420\n And for me, I think it's certainly,\n\n2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:18.260\n we do share a lot of similarity here.\n\n2:06:18.260 --> 2:06:20.420\n So creation is also really important for me,\n\n2:06:20.420 --> 2:06:22.860\n even from the things I've already talked about,\n\n2:06:24.740 --> 2:06:26.140\n even like writing papers,\n\n2:06:26.140 --> 2:06:28.540\n and these are all creations as well.\n\n2:06:30.140 --> 2:06:32.620\n And I have not quite thought\n\n2:06:32.620 --> 2:06:34.860\n whether that is really the meaning of my life.\n\n2:06:34.860 --> 2:06:37.260\n Like in a sense, also then maybe like,\n\n2:06:37.260 --> 2:06:38.380\n what kind of things should you create?\n\n2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:41.060\n There are so many different things that you could create.\n\n2:06:42.660 --> 2:06:46.380\n And also you can say, another view is maybe growth.\n\n2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:50.580\n It's related, but different from experience.\n\n2:06:50.580 --> 2:06:53.420\n Growth is also maybe type of meaning of life.\n\n2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:55.740\n It's just, you try to grow every day,\n\n2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:59.740\n try to be a better self every day.\n\n2:06:59.740 --> 2:07:04.420\n And also ultimately, we are here,\n\n2:07:04.420 --> 2:07:07.420\n it's part of the overall evolution.\n\n2:07:09.140 --> 2:07:11.780\n Right, the world is evolving and it's growing.\n\n2:07:11.780 --> 2:07:14.580\n Isn't it funny that the growth seems to be\n\n2:07:14.580 --> 2:07:15.620\n the more important thing\n\n2:07:15.620 --> 2:07:18.100\n than the thing you're growing towards.\n\n2:07:18.100 --> 2:07:21.540\n It's like, it's not the goal, it's the journey to it.\n\n2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:25.580\n It's almost when you submit a paper,\n\n2:07:27.020 --> 2:07:29.220\n there's a sort of depressing element to it,\n\n2:07:29.220 --> 2:07:30.220\n not to submit a paper,\n\n2:07:30.220 --> 2:07:32.340\n but when that whole project is over.\n\n2:07:32.340 --> 2:07:34.020\n I mean, there's the gratitude,\n\n2:07:34.020 --> 2:07:35.260\n there's the celebration and so on,\n\n2:07:35.260 --> 2:07:39.300\n but you're usually immediately looking for the next thing\n\n2:07:39.300 --> 2:07:40.500\n or the next step, right?\n\n2:07:40.500 --> 2:07:44.380\n It's not that, the end of it is not the satisfaction,\n\n2:07:44.380 --> 2:07:47.180\n it's the hardship, the challenge you have to overcome,\n\n2:07:47.180 --> 2:07:48.780\n the growth through the process.\n\n2:07:48.780 --> 2:07:51.340\n It's somehow probably deeply within us,\n\n2:07:51.340 --> 2:07:54.420\n the same thing that drives the evolutionary process\n\n2:07:54.420 --> 2:07:55.900\n is somehow within us,\n\n2:07:55.900 --> 2:07:58.860\n with everything the way we see the world.\n\n2:07:58.860 --> 2:08:00.100\n Since you're thinking about these,\n\n2:08:00.100 --> 2:08:02.820\n so you're still in search of an answer.\n\n2:08:02.820 --> 2:08:05.420\n I mean, yes and no,\n\n2:08:05.420 --> 2:08:07.780\n in the sense that I think for people\n\n2:08:07.780 --> 2:08:11.940\n who really dedicate time to search for the answer\n\n2:08:11.940 --> 2:08:15.700\n to ask the question, what is the meaning of life?\n\n2:08:15.700 --> 2:08:18.180\n It does not necessarily bring you happiness.\n\n2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:20.460\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:20.460 --> 2:08:23.740\n It's a question, we can say, right?\n\n2:08:23.740 --> 2:08:25.700\n Like whether it's a well defined question.\n\n2:08:25.700 --> 2:08:30.180\n And, but on the other hand,\n\n2:08:30.180 --> 2:08:33.860\n given that you get to answer it yourself,\n\n2:08:33.860 --> 2:08:35.740\n you can define it yourself,\n\n2:08:35.740 --> 2:08:40.740\n then sure, I can just give it an answer.\n\n2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:44.700\n And in that sense, yes, it can help.\n\n2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:47.860\n Like we discussed, right?\n\n2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:52.860\n If you say, oh, then my meaning of life is to create\n\n2:08:52.900 --> 2:08:57.380\n or to grow, then yes, then I think they can help.\n\n2:08:57.380 --> 2:09:00.380\n But how do you know that that is really the meaning of life\n\n2:09:00.380 --> 2:09:02.060\n or the meaning of your life?\n\n2:09:02.060 --> 2:09:04.620\n It's like there's no way for you\n\n2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:05.740\n to really answer the question.\n\n2:09:05.740 --> 2:09:10.060\n Sure, but something about that certainty is liberating.\n\n2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:12.820\n So it might be an illusion, you might not really know,\n\n2:09:12.820 --> 2:09:15.580\n you might be just convincing yourself falsely,\n\n2:09:15.580 --> 2:09:18.020\n but being sure that that's the meaning,\n\n2:09:18.020 --> 2:09:23.020\n there's something liberating in that.\n\n2:09:23.340 --> 2:09:26.340\n There's something freeing in knowing this is your purpose.\n\n2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:29.060\n So you can fully give yourself to that.\n\n2:09:29.060 --> 2:09:30.700\n Without, you know, for a long time,\n\n2:09:30.700 --> 2:09:33.220\n you know, I thought like, isn't it all relative?\n\n2:09:33.220 --> 2:09:38.140\n Like why, how do we even know what's good and what's evil?\n\n2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:39.900\n Like isn't everything just relative?\n\n2:09:39.900 --> 2:09:42.740\n Like how do we know, you know,\n\n2:09:42.740 --> 2:09:44.940\n the question of meaning is ultimately\n\n2:09:44.940 --> 2:09:48.380\n the question of why do anything?\n\n2:09:48.380 --> 2:09:50.260\n Why is anything good or bad?\n\n2:09:50.260 --> 2:09:52.580\n Why is anything valuable and so on?\n\n2:09:52.580 --> 2:09:53.580\n Exactly.\n\n2:09:53.580 --> 2:09:58.380\n Then you start to, I think just like you said,\n\n2:09:58.380 --> 2:10:01.140\n I think it's a really useful question to ask,\n\n2:10:02.140 --> 2:10:07.140\n but if you ask it for too long and too aggressively.\n\n2:10:07.660 --> 2:10:08.820\n It may not be so productive.\n\n2:10:08.820 --> 2:10:13.340\n It may not be productive and not just for traditionally\n\n2:10:13.340 --> 2:10:17.260\n societally defined success, but also for happiness.\n\n2:10:17.260 --> 2:10:20.420\n It seems like asking the question about the meaning of life\n\n2:10:20.420 --> 2:10:21.860\n is like a trap.\n\n2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:25.820\n We're destined to be asking.\n\n2:10:25.820 --> 2:10:27.340\n We're destined to look up to the stars\n\n2:10:27.340 --> 2:10:28.780\n and ask these big why questions\n\n2:10:28.780 --> 2:10:30.500\n we'll never be able to answer,\n\n2:10:30.500 --> 2:10:31.980\n but we shouldn't get lost in them.\n\n2:10:31.980 --> 2:10:34.180\n I think that's probably the,\n\n2:10:34.180 --> 2:10:36.260\n that's at least the lesson I picked up so far.\n\n2:10:36.260 --> 2:10:37.540\n On that topic.\n\n2:10:37.540 --> 2:10:38.820\n Oh, let me just add one more thing.\n\n2:10:38.820 --> 2:10:40.020\n So it's interesting.\n\n2:10:40.020 --> 2:10:45.020\n So sometimes, yes, it can help you to focus.\n\n2:10:47.020 --> 2:10:52.020\n So when I shifted my focus more from security\n\n2:10:53.300 --> 2:10:55.140\n to AI and machine learning,\n\n2:10:55.140 --> 2:10:58.500\n at the time, actually one of the main reasons\n\n2:10:58.500 --> 2:11:02.820\n that I did that was because at the time,\n\n2:11:02.820 --> 2:11:07.380\n I thought the meaning of my life\n\n2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:11.700\n and the purpose of my life is to build intelligent machines.\n\n2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:16.620\n And that's, and then your inner voice said\n\n2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:18.580\n that this is the right,\n\n2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:20.060\n this is the right journey to take\n\n2:11:20.060 --> 2:11:21.340\n to build intelligent machines\n\n2:11:21.340 --> 2:11:23.380\n and that you actually fully realize\n\n2:11:23.380 --> 2:11:26.420\n you took a really legitimate big step\n\n2:11:26.420 --> 2:11:28.460\n to become one of the world class researchers\n\n2:11:28.460 --> 2:11:32.540\n to actually make it, to actually go down that journey.\n\n2:11:32.540 --> 2:11:34.300\n Yeah, that's profound.\n\n2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:36.460\n That's profound.\n\n2:11:36.460 --> 2:11:39.380\n I don't think there's a better way\n\n2:11:39.380 --> 2:11:42.980\n to end a conversation than talking for a while\n\n2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:44.060\n about the meaning of life.\n\n2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:46.020\n Dawn is a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n2:11:46.020 --> 2:11:47.540\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n2:11:47.540 --> 2:11:48.980\n Thank you, thank you.\n\n2:11:49.900 --> 2:11:52.580\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dawn Song\n\n2:11:52.580 -->

getting them to do strange things.\n\n2:12:24.340 --> 2:12:36.020\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
