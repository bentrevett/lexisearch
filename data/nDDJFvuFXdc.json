outspoken critic of string theory,\n\n00:06.640 --> 00:10.000\n and the author of the popular physics and mathematics blog\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:12.480\n called Not Even Wrong.\n\n00:13.400 --> 00:15.600\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:15.600 --> 00:17.580\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:17.580 --> 00:18.760\n in the description.\n\n00:18.760 --> 00:22.380\n And now, here's my conversation with Peter White.\n\n00:23.640 --> 00:27.360\n You're both a physicist and a mathematician.\n\n00:27.360 --> 00:29.020\n So let me ask, what is the difference\n\n00:29.020 --> 00:31.680\n between physics and mathematics?\n\n00:31.680 --> 00:33.800\n Well, there's kind of a conventional understanding\n\n00:33.800 --> 00:37.280\n of the subject that they're two quite different things.\n\n00:37.280 --> 00:41.600\n So that mathematics is about making rigorous statements\n\n00:41.600 --> 00:45.600\n about these abstract things,\n\n00:45.600 --> 00:48.360\n things of mathematics, and proving them rigorously.\n\n00:48.360 --> 00:51.000\n And physics is about doing experiments\n\n00:51.000 --> 00:53.940\n and testing various models and that.\n\n00:53.940 --> 00:55.880\n But I think the more interesting thing\n\n00:55.880 --> 01:00.840\n is that there's a wide variety of what people do\n\n01:00.840 --> 01:02.520\n as mathematics, what they do as physics,\n\n01:02.520 --> 01:04.040\n and there's a significant overlap.\n\n01:04.040 --> 01:09.000\n And that, I think, is actually a very interesting area.\n\n01:09.000 --> 01:12.600\n And if you go back kind of far enough in history\n\n01:12.600 --> 01:15.760\n and look at figures like Newton or something,\n\n01:15.760 --> 01:17.280\n at that point, you can't really tell,\n\n01:17.280 --> 01:19.880\n was Newton a physicist or a mathematician?\n\n01:19.880 --> 01:21.700\n Mathematicians will tell you he was a mathematician.\n\n01:21.700 --> 01:23.380\n The physicists will tell you he was a physicist.\n\n01:23.380 --> 01:26.040\n But he would say he's a philosopher.\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:28.880\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n01:28.880 --> 01:32.400\n But yeah, anyway, there was kind of no such distinction\n\n01:32.400 --> 01:35.000\n then that's more of a modern thing.\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.100\n But anyway, I think these days,\n\n01:36.100 --> 01:38.080\n there's a very interesting space in between the two.\n\n01:38.080 --> 01:40.820\n So in the story of the 20th century\n\n01:40.820 --> 01:42.360\n and the early 21st century,\n\n01:42.360 --> 01:44.640\n what is the overlap between mathematics and physics,\n\n01:44.640 --> 01:45.960\n would you say?\n\n01:45.960 --> 01:49.800\n Well, I think it's actually become very, very complicated.\n\n01:49.800 --> 01:51.520\n I think it's really interesting to see\n\n01:51.520 --> 01:54.280\n a lot of what my colleagues in the math department\n\n01:54.280 --> 01:56.880\n are doing, most of what they're doing,\n\n01:56.880 --> 01:58.140\n they're doing all sorts of different things,\n\n01:58.140 --> 02:00.360\n but most of them have some kind of overlap\n\n02:00.360 --> 02:02.360\n with physics or other.\n\n02:02.360 --> 02:03.840\n So, I mean, I'm personally interested\n\n02:03.840 --> 02:06.640\n in one particular aspect of this overlap,\n\n02:06.640 --> 02:09.680\n which I think has a lot to do with the most fundamental ideas\n\n02:09.680 --> 02:12.040\n about physics and about mathematics.\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:17.040\n But you kind of see this really everywhere at this point.\n\n02:17.040 --> 02:20.480\n Which particular overlap are you looking at, group theory?\n\n02:20.480 --> 02:24.440\n Yeah, so at least the way it seems to me\n\n02:24.440 --> 02:25.520\n that if you look at physics\n\n02:25.520 --> 02:29.960\n and look at our most successful laws of fundamental physics,\n\n02:29.960 --> 02:33.480\n they have a certain kind of mathematical structure,\n\n02:33.480 --> 02:36.240\n it's based upon certain kind of mathematical objects\n\n02:36.240 --> 02:38.800\n and geometry, connections and curvature,\n\n02:38.800 --> 02:41.720\n the spinners, the Dirac equation.\n\n02:41.720 --> 02:46.720\n And this very deep mathematics provides kind of a unifying\n\n02:47.720 --> 02:50.480\n set of ways of thinking that allow you\n\n02:50.480 --> 02:52.720\n to make a unified theory of physics.\n\n02:52.720 --> 02:55.480\n But the interesting thing is that if you go to mathematics\n\n02:55.480 --> 02:58.440\n and look at what's been going on in mathematics\n\n02:58.440 --> 03:02.640\n the last 50, 100 years, and even especially recently,\n\n03:02.640 --> 03:06.720\n there's a similarly some kind of unifying ideas\n\n03:06.720 --> 03:08.840\n which bring together different areas of mathematics\n\n03:08.840 --> 03:11.680\n and which have been established in the last 50, 100 years.\n\n03:11.680 --> 03:13.680\n Especially powerful in number theory recently.\n\n03:13.680 --> 03:17.720\n And there's a book, for instance, by Edward Frankel\n\n03:17.720 --> 03:19.240\n about love and math.\n\n03:19.240 --> 03:21.320\n Yeah, that book's great, I recommend it highly.\n\n03:21.320 --> 03:24.160\n It's partially accessible.\n\n03:24.160 --> 03:27.800\n But there's a nice audio book that I listened to\n\n03:27.800 --> 03:31.920\n while running an exceptionally long distance,\n\n03:31.920 --> 03:35.500\n like across the San Francisco bridge.\n\n03:35.500 --> 03:38.940\n And there's something magic about the way he writes about it.\n\n03:38.940 --> 03:40.520\n But some of the group theory in there\n\n03:40.520 --> 03:42.240\n is a little bit difficult.\n\n03:42.240 --> 03:44.000\n Yeah, that's the problem with any of these things,\n\n03:44.000 --> 03:45.960\n to kind of really say what's going on\n\n03:45.960 --> 03:48.880\n and make it accessible is very hard.\n\n03:48.880 --> 03:52.360\n He, in this book and elsewhere, I think takes the attitude\n\n03:52.360 --> 03:54.440\n that kinds of mathematics he's interested in\n\n03:54.440 --> 03:57.080\n and that he's talking about provide\n\n03:57.080 --> 03:59.240\n kind of a grand unified theory of mathematics.\n\n03:59.240 --> 04:03.160\n They bring together geometry and number theory\n\n04:03.160 --> 04:06.840\n and representation theory, a lot of different ideas\n\n04:06.840 --> 04:09.700\n in a really unexpected way.\n\n04:09.700 --> 04:11.440\n But I think, to me, the most fascinating thing\n\n04:11.440 --> 04:13.840\n is if you look at the kind of grand unified theory\n\n04:13.840 --> 04:15.440\n of mathematics he's talking about\n\n04:15.440 --> 04:17.520\n and you look at the physicist kind of ideas\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:19.800\n about unification, it's more or less\n\n04:19.800 --> 04:22.600\n the same mathematical objects are appearing in both.\n\n04:22.600 --> 04:24.880\n So it's this, I think there's a really,\n\n04:24.880 --> 04:26.440\n we're seeing a really strong indication\n\n04:26.440 --> 04:30.240\n that the deepest ideas that we're discovering about physics\n\n04:30.240 --> 04:32.400\n and some of the deepest ideas that mathematicians\n\n04:32.400 --> 04:36.120\n are learning about are really, are intimately connected.\n\n04:36.120 --> 04:38.840\n Is there something, like if I was five years old\n\n04:38.840 --> 04:40.640\n and you were trying to explain this to me,\n\n04:40.640 --> 04:43.720\n is there ways to try to sneak up\n\n04:43.720 --> 04:47.400\n to what this unified world of mathematics looks like?\n\n04:47.400 --> 04:50.200\n You said number theory, you said geometry,\n\n04:50.200 --> 04:52.520\n words like topology.\n\n04:52.520 --> 04:54.520\n What does this universe begin to look like?\n\n04:54.520 --> 04:57.500\n Are these, what should we imagine in our mind?\n\n04:57.500 --> 05:00.840\n Is it a three dimensional surface?\n\n05:00.840 --> 05:03.240\n And we're trying to say something about it.\n\n05:03.240 --> 05:07.320\n Is it triangles and squares and cubes?\n\n05:07.320 --> 05:09.460\n Like what are we supposed to imagine in our minds?\n\n05:09.460 --> 05:10.560\n Is this natural number?\n\n05:10.560 --> 05:13.880\n What's a good thing to try to,\n\n05:13.880 --> 05:16.800\n for people that don't know any of these tools\n\n05:16.800 --> 05:19.000\n except maybe some basic calculus and geometry\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:22.240\n from high school that they should keep in their minds\n\n05:22.240 --> 05:24.860\n as to the unified world of mathematics\n\n05:24.860 --> 05:29.860\n that also allows us to explore the unified world of physics.\n\n05:30.480 --> 05:33.120\n I mean, what I find kind of remarkable about this\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:38.120\n is the way in which these, we've discovered these ideas,\n\n05:38.200 --> 05:40.240\n but they're actually quite alien\n\n05:40.240 --> 05:42.440\n to our everyday understanding.\n\n05:42.440 --> 05:45.640\n We grow up in this three spatial dimensional world\n\n05:45.640 --> 05:47.480\n and we have intimate understanding\n\n05:47.480 --> 05:50.440\n of certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things.\n\n05:50.440 --> 05:53.520\n But these things that we've discovered\n\n05:53.520 --> 05:56.060\n in both math and physics are,\n\n05:56.060 --> 05:58.300\n that they're not at all close,\n\n05:58.300 --> 05:59.800\n have any obvious connection\n\n05:59.800 --> 06:02.040\n to kind of human everyday experience.\n\n06:02.040 --> 06:03.160\n They're really quite different.\n\n06:03.160 --> 06:06.040\n And I can say some of my initial fascination with this\n\n06:06.040 --> 06:08.400\n when I was young and starting to learn about it\n\n06:08.400 --> 06:13.400\n was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature\n\n06:14.160 --> 06:15.000\n of these things.\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:17.420\n It was a little bit like being told,\n\n06:17.420 --> 06:21.040\n well, there are these kind of semi mystical experience\n\n06:21.040 --> 06:24.340\n that you can acquire by a long study and whatever,\n\n06:24.340 --> 06:27.000\n except that it was actually true.\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.560\n There's actually evidence that this actually works.\n\n06:29.560 --> 06:33.000\n So I'm a little bit wary of trying to give people\n\n06:33.000 --> 06:33.840\n that kind of thing,\n\n06:33.840 --> 06:35.200\n because I think it's mostly misleading.\n\n06:35.200 --> 06:39.880\n But one thing to say is that geometry is a large part of it.\n\n06:39.880 --> 06:43.280\n And maybe one interesting thing to say very,\n\n06:43.280 --> 06:45.800\n that's about more recent, some of the most recent ideas\n\n06:45.800 --> 06:48.440\n is that when we think about the geometry\n\n06:48.440 --> 06:50.040\n of our space and time,\n\n06:50.040 --> 06:53.640\n it's kind of three spatial and one time dimension.\n\n06:53.640 --> 06:56.760\n It's a physics is in some sense\n\n06:56.760 --> 07:00.760\n about something that's kind of four dimensional in a way.\n\n07:00.760 --> 07:03.720\n And a really interesting thing about\n\n07:03.720 --> 07:06.160\n some of the recent developments and number theory\n\n07:06.160 --> 07:09.960\n have been to realize that these ideas\n\n07:09.960 --> 07:12.760\n that we were looking at naturally fit into a context\n\n07:12.760 --> 07:15.860\n where your theory is kind of four dimensional.\n\n07:15.860 --> 07:19.840\n So, geometry is a big part of this\n\n07:19.840 --> 07:22.160\n and we know a lot and feel a lot about\n\n07:22.160 --> 07:24.600\n two, one, two, three dimensional geometry.\n\n07:24.600 --> 07:28.100\n So wait a minute, so we can at least rely\n\n07:28.100 --> 07:31.520\n on the four dimensions of space and time\n\n07:31.520 --> 07:32.920\n and say that we can get pretty far\n\n07:32.920 --> 07:35.640\n by working in those four dimensions.\n\n07:35.640 --> 07:36.700\n I thought you were gonna scare me\n\n07:36.700 --> 07:39.000\n that we're gonna have to go to many, many, many,\n\n07:39.000 --> 07:40.640\n many more dimensions than that.\n\n07:40.640 --> 07:43.360\n My point of view, which goes against\n\n07:43.360 --> 07:44.800\n a lot of these ideas about unification\n\n07:44.800 --> 07:46.440\n is that no, this is really,\n\n07:47.320 --> 07:50.560\n everything we know about really is about four dimensions\n\n07:50.560 --> 07:54.800\n and that you can actually understand a lot of these\n\n07:54.800 --> 07:56.840\n structures that we've been seeing in fundamental physics\n\n07:56.840 --> 08:01.480\n and in number theory, just in terms of four dimensions,\n\n08:01.480 --> 08:05.400\n that it's kind of, it's in some sense I would claim\n\n08:05.400 --> 08:09.040\n has been a really, has been kind of a mistake\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:12.880\n that physicists have made for decades and decades\n\n08:12.880 --> 08:16.560\n to try to go to higher dimensions,\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:19.040\n to try to formulate a theory in higher dimensions\n\n08:19.040 --> 08:21.600\n and then you're stuck with the problem\n\n08:21.600 --> 08:23.400\n of how do you get rid of all these extra dimensions\n\n08:23.400 --> 08:25.080\n that you've created\n\n08:25.080 --> 08:27.440\n because we only ever see anything in four dimensions.\n\n08:27.440 --> 08:29.920\n That kind of thing leaves us astray, you think?\n\n08:29.920 --> 08:31.960\n So creating all these extra dimensions\n\n08:31.960 --> 08:34.620\n just to give yourself extra degrees of freedom.\n\n08:35.800 --> 08:38.360\n Isn't that the process of mathematics\n\n08:38.360 --> 08:41.280\n is to create all of these trajectories for yourself\n\n08:41.280 --> 08:45.920\n but eventually you have to end up at the final place\n\n08:45.920 --> 08:50.920\n but it's okay to sort of create abstract objects\n\n08:52.600 --> 08:55.880\n on your path to proving something.\n\n08:55.880 --> 08:59.640\n Yeah, certainly and from a mathematician's point of view,\n\n08:59.640 --> 09:01.360\n I mean, the kinds of,\n\n09:01.360 --> 09:03.440\n mathematicians also are very different than physicists\n\n09:03.440 --> 09:06.040\n in that we like to develop very general theories.\n\n09:06.040 --> 09:07.200\n We like to, if we have an idea,\n\n09:07.200 --> 09:09.680\n we want to see what's the greatest generality\n\n09:09.680 --> 09:11.140\n in which you can talk about it.\n\n09:11.140 --> 09:14.200\n So from the point of view of most of the ways geometry\n\n09:14.200 --> 09:17.040\n is formulated by mathematicians,\n\n09:17.040 --> 09:19.080\n it really doesn't matter, it works in any dimension.\n\n09:19.080 --> 09:22.120\n We can do one, two, three, four, any number.\n\n09:22.120 --> 09:24.860\n There's no particular, for most of geometry,\n\n09:24.860 --> 09:28.240\n there's no particular special thing about four.\n\n09:28.240 --> 09:33.240\n But anyway, but what physicists have been trying to do\n\n09:33.240 --> 09:35.800\n over the years is try to understand\n\n09:35.800 --> 09:38.320\n these fundamental theories in a geometrical way\n\n09:38.320 --> 09:41.960\n and it's very tempting to kind of just start bringing in\n\n09:41.960 --> 09:46.200\n extra dimensions and using them to explain the structure.\n\n09:46.200 --> 09:51.200\n But typically this attempt kind of founders\n\n09:51.320 --> 09:53.340\n because you just don't know,\n\n09:53.340 --> 09:57.140\n you end up not being able to explain why we only see four.\n\n09:59.320 --> 10:01.800\n It is nice in the space of physics\n\n10:01.800 --> 10:04.520\n that like if you look at Fermat's last theorem,\n\n10:04.520 --> 10:06.680\n it's much easier to prove that there's no solution\n\n10:06.680 --> 10:11.680\n for n equals three than it is for the general case.\n\n10:12.120 --> 10:16.360\n And so I guess that's the nice benefit of being a physicist\n\n10:16.360 --> 10:18.640\n is you don't have to worry about the general case\n\n10:18.640 --> 10:22.160\n because we live in a universe with n equals four\n\n10:22.160 --> 10:23.440\n in this case.\n\n10:23.440 --> 10:27.880\n Yeah, physicists are very interested in saying something\n\n10:27.880 --> 10:31.440\n about specific examples and I find that interesting\n\n10:31.440 --> 10:33.760\n when I'm trying to do things in mathematics\n\n10:33.760 --> 10:36.920\n and I'm even teaching courses into mathematics students,\n\n10:36.920 --> 10:40.200\n I find that I'm teaching them in a different way\n\n10:40.200 --> 10:43.880\n than most mathematicians because I'm very often\n\n10:43.880 --> 10:47.800\n very focused on examples on what's kind of the crucial\n\n10:47.800 --> 10:52.480\n example that shows how this powerful new mathematical\n\n10:52.480 --> 10:55.680\n technique, how it works and why you would want to do it.\n\n10:55.680 --> 11:00.040\n And I'm less interested in kind of proving a precise theorem\n\n11:00.040 --> 11:01.400\n about exactly when it's gonna work\n\n11:01.400 --> 11:02.440\n and when it's not gonna work.\n\n11:02.440 --> 11:05.160\n Do you usually think about really simple examples,\n\n11:05.160 --> 11:09.080\n like both for teaching and when you try to solve\n\n11:09.080 --> 11:12.160\n a difficult problem, do you construct the simplest\n\n11:12.160 --> 11:14.360\n possible examples that captures the fundamentals\n\n11:14.360 --> 11:15.720\n of the problem and try to solve it?\n\n11:15.720 --> 11:19.640\n Yeah, exactly, that's often a really fruitful way\n\n11:19.640 --> 11:22.520\n to if you've got some idea to just kind of try\n\n11:22.520 --> 11:27.000\n to boil it down to what's the simplest situation\n\n11:27.000 --> 11:28.680\n in which this kind of thing is gonna happen\n\n11:28.680 --> 11:31.320\n and then try to really understand that and understand that\n\n11:31.320 --> 11:33.520\n and that is almost always a really good way\n\n11:33.520 --> 11:34.480\n to get insight into it.\n\n11:34.480 --> 11:37.720\n Do you work with paper and pen or like, for example,\n\n11:37.720 --> 11:41.560\n for me coming from the programming side,\n\n11:41.560 --> 11:43.880\n if I look at a model, if I look at some kind\n\n11:43.880 --> 11:47.360\n of mathematical object, I like to mess around\n\n11:47.360 --> 11:49.600\n with it sort of numerically.\n\n11:49.600 --> 11:51.600\n I just visualize different parts of it,\n\n11:51.600 --> 11:54.160\n visualize however I can so most of the work\n\n11:54.160 --> 11:56.160\n is like when you're on networks, for example,\n\n11:56.160 --> 11:59.360\n is you try to play with the simplest possible example\n\n11:59.360 --> 12:04.360\n and just to build up intuition by any kind of object\n\n12:04.440 --> 12:07.280\n has a bunch of variables in it and you start\n\n12:07.280 --> 12:09.040\n to mess around with them in different ways\n\n12:09.040 --> 12:10.480\n and visualize in different ways to start\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:14.720\n to build intuition or do you go the Einstein route\n\n12:14.720 --> 12:19.160\n and just imagine everything inside your mind\n\n12:19.160 --> 12:21.200\n and sort of build thought experiments\n\n12:21.200 --> 12:24.840\n and then work purely on paper and pen?\n\n12:24.840 --> 12:28.120\n Well, the problem with this kind of stuff\n\n12:28.120 --> 12:31.880\n I'm interested in is you rarely can kind of,\n\n12:31.880 --> 12:34.780\n it's rarely something that is really kind of,\n\n12:34.780 --> 12:38.600\n or even the simplest example, you can kind of see\n\n12:38.600 --> 12:40.800\n what's going on by looking at something happening\n\n12:40.800 --> 12:42.240\n in three dimensions.\n\n12:42.240 --> 12:44.600\n There's generally the structures involved\n\n12:44.600 --> 12:47.960\n are either they're more abstract\n\n12:47.960 --> 12:50.720\n or if you try to kind of embed them in some kind of space\n\n12:50.720 --> 12:53.800\n and where you could manipulate them\n\n12:53.800 --> 12:55.200\n in some kind of geometrical way,\n\n12:55.200 --> 12:57.320\n it's gonna be a much higher dimensional space.\n\n12:57.320 --> 13:00.080\n So even simple examples,\n\n13:00.080 --> 13:02.080\n the embedding them into three dimensional space,\n\n13:02.080 --> 13:03.040\n you're losing a lot.\n\n13:03.040 --> 13:06.960\n Yeah, but to capture what you're trying to understand\n\n13:06.960 --> 13:09.720\n about them, you have to go to four or more dimensions.\n\n13:09.720 --> 13:12.000\n So it starts to get to be hard to,\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.680\n I mean, you can train yourself to try it as much\n\n13:14.680 --> 13:18.200\n as to kind of think about things in your mind\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:21.000\n and I often use pad and paper\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:24.360\n and often if I'm in my office, I have to use the blackboard\n\n13:25.480 --> 13:26.920\n and you are kind of drawing things\n\n13:26.920 --> 13:29.600\n but they're really kind of more abstract representations\n\n13:29.600 --> 13:32.560\n of how things are supposed to fit together\n\n13:32.560 --> 13:35.240\n and they're not really, unfortunately,\n\n13:35.240 --> 13:37.640\n not just kind of really living in three dimensions\n\n13:37.640 --> 13:39.200\n where you can.\n\n13:39.200 --> 13:41.620\n Are we supposed to be sad or excited\n\n13:41.620 --> 13:43.160\n by the fact that our human minds\n\n13:43.160 --> 13:45.040\n can't fully comprehend the kind of mathematics\n\n13:45.040 --> 13:46.000\n you're talking about?\n\n13:46.000 --> 13:48.760\n I mean, what do we make of that?\n\n13:48.760 --> 13:50.740\n I mean, to me, that makes you quite sad.\n\n13:50.740 --> 13:53.960\n It makes it seem like there's a giant mystery out there\n\n13:53.960 --> 13:58.320\n that we'll never truly get to experience directly.\n\n13:58.320 --> 14:01.720\n It is kind of sad how difficult this is.\n\n14:01.720 --> 14:03.680\n I mean, or I would put it a different way\n\n14:03.680 --> 14:06.600\n that most questions that people have\n\n14:06.600 --> 14:08.640\n about this kind of thing,\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:12.240\n you can give them a really true answer\n\n14:12.240 --> 14:13.080\n and really understand it\n\n14:13.080 --> 14:16.580\n but the problem is one more of time.\n\n14:16.580 --> 14:20.360\n It's like, yes, I could explain to you how this works\n\n14:20.360 --> 14:23.040\n but you'd have to be willing to sit down with me\n\n14:23.040 --> 14:28.000\n and work at this repeatedly for hours and days and weeks\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:31.540\n and it's just gonna take that long for your mind\n\n14:31.540 --> 14:34.360\n to really wrap itself around what's going on\n\n14:34.360 --> 14:39.360\n and so that does make things inaccessible which is sad\n\n14:40.560 --> 14:43.000\n but it's just kind of part of life\n\n14:43.000 --> 14:45.000\n that we all have a limited amount of time\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:49.760\n and we have to decide what we're gonna spend our time doing.\n\n14:49.760 --> 14:52.280\n Speaking of a limited amount of time,\n\n14:52.280 --> 14:55.640\n we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together\n\n14:55.640 --> 14:56.840\n here on this podcast.\n\n14:57.760 --> 15:02.320\n Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas\n\n15:02.320 --> 15:05.280\n that you work on in mathematics and physics,\n\n15:05.280 --> 15:07.560\n which is the most beautiful idea\n\n15:07.560 --> 15:11.200\n or one of the most beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea\n\n15:11.200 --> 15:13.960\n and once again, unfortunately, the way life works,\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:15.680\n we only have a limited time together\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:18.440\n to try to convey such an idea.\n\n15:18.440 --> 15:22.520\n Okay, well, actually, let me just tell you something which\n\n15:22.520 --> 15:25.260\n I'm tempted to kind of start trying to explain\n\n15:25.260 --> 15:26.980\n what I think is this most powerful idea\n\n15:26.980 --> 15:28.600\n that brings together math and physics,\n\n15:28.600 --> 15:31.060\n ideas about groups and representations\n\n15:31.060 --> 15:33.200\n and how it fits in quantum mechanics\n\n15:33.200 --> 15:35.560\n but in some sense, I wrote a whole textbook about that\n\n15:35.560 --> 15:37.440\n and I don't think we really have time\n\n15:37.440 --> 15:39.080\n to get very far into it so.\n\n15:39.080 --> 15:41.320\n Well, can I actually, on a small tangent,\n\n15:41.320 --> 15:43.600\n you did write a paper towards a grant unified theory\n\n15:43.600 --> 15:47.840\n mathematics and physics, maybe you could step there first,\n\n15:47.840 --> 15:49.520\n what is the key idea in that paper?\n\n15:49.520 --> 15:51.480\n Well, I think we've kind of gone over that.\n\n15:51.480 --> 15:53.560\n I think that the key idea is what we were talking about\n\n15:53.560 --> 15:58.360\n earlier that just kind of a claim that if you look\n\n15:58.360 --> 16:01.400\n and see what have been successful ideas in unification\n\n16:01.400 --> 16:05.160\n in physics and over the last 50 years or so\n\n16:05.160 --> 16:07.760\n and what's been happening in mathematics\n\n16:07.760 --> 16:10.800\n and the kind of thing that Frankel's book is about\n\n16:10.800 --> 16:13.000\n that these are very much the same kind of mathematics\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.420\n and so it's kind of an argument that there really is,\n\n16:16.420 --> 16:19.720\n you shouldn't be looking to unify just math\n\n16:19.720 --> 16:23.140\n or just fundamental physics but taking inspiration\n\n16:23.140 --> 16:25.560\n for looking for new ideas in fundamental physics\n\n16:25.560 --> 16:27.380\n that they are gonna be in the same direction\n\n16:27.380 --> 16:30.200\n of getting deeper into mathematics\n\n16:30.200 --> 16:33.280\n and looking for more inspiration in mathematics\n\n16:33.280 --> 16:37.320\n from these successful ideas about fundamental physics.\n\n16:37.320 --> 16:39.480\n Could you put words to sort of the disciplines\n\n16:39.480 --> 16:40.400\n we're trying to unify?\n\n16:40.400 --> 16:42.920\n So you said number theory, are we literally talking\n\n16:42.920 --> 16:45.040\n about all the major fields of mathematics?\n\n16:45.040 --> 16:48.280\n So it's like the number theory, geometry,\n\n16:48.280 --> 16:51.040\n so the differential geometry, topology.\n\n16:51.040 --> 16:54.440\n Yeah, so the, I mean, one name for this\n\n16:55.400 --> 16:57.600\n that this is acquired in mathematics\n\n16:57.600 --> 16:59.760\n is the so called Langlands program\n\n16:59.760 --> 17:01.960\n and so this started out in mathematics.\n\n17:01.960 --> 17:05.120\n It's that Robert Langlands kind of realized\n\n17:05.120 --> 17:07.480\n that a lot of what people were doing\n\n17:07.480 --> 17:11.080\n and that was starting to be really successful\n\n17:11.080 --> 17:13.600\n in number theory in the 60s\n\n17:13.600 --> 17:17.800\n and so that this actually was,\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:21.160\n anyway, that this could be thought of\n\n17:21.160 --> 17:24.120\n in terms of these ideas about symmetry\n\n17:24.120 --> 17:26.100\n and groups and representations\n\n17:26.100 --> 17:29.600\n and in a way that was also close\n\n17:29.600 --> 17:32.020\n to some ideas about geometry\n\n17:32.020 --> 17:35.200\n and then more later on in the 80s, 90s,\n\n17:35.200 --> 17:38.120\n there was something called geometric Langlands\n\n17:38.120 --> 17:40.500\n that people realize that you could take\n\n17:40.500 --> 17:43.120\n what people have been doing in number theory in Langlands\n\n17:43.120 --> 17:45.560\n and get rid, just forget about the number theory\n\n17:45.560 --> 17:48.000\n and ask what is this telling you about geometry\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:49.960\n and you get a whole, some new insights\n\n17:49.960 --> 17:52.360\n into certain kinds of geometry that way.\n\n17:52.360 --> 17:54.860\n So it's, anyway, that's kind of the name\n\n17:54.860 --> 17:58.080\n for this area is Langlands and geometric Langlands\n\n17:58.080 --> 17:59.680\n and just recently in the last few months,\n\n17:59.680 --> 18:02.760\n there's been, there's kind of really major paper\n\n18:02.760 --> 18:06.660\n that appeared by Peter Schultze and Laurent Farg\n\n18:06.660 --> 18:11.040\n where they made some serious advance\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:16.000\n to try to understand very much kind of a local problem\n\n18:16.000 --> 18:17.960\n of what happens in number theory\n\n18:17.960 --> 18:19.760\n near a certain prime number\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:22.060\n and they turned this into a problem\n\n18:22.060 --> 18:26.040\n of exactly the kind that geometric Langlands people\n\n18:26.040 --> 18:28.880\n had been doing, this kind of pure geometry problem\n\n18:28.880 --> 18:32.360\n and they found by generalizing mathematics,\n\n18:32.360 --> 18:34.280\n they could actually reformulate it in that way\n\n18:34.280 --> 18:36.680\n and it worked perfectly well.\n\n18:36.680 --> 18:41.680\n One of the things that makes me sad is I'm a pretty\n\n18:42.760 --> 18:46.440\n knowledgeable person and then, what is it?\n\n18:46.440 --> 18:48.280\n At least I'm in the neighborhood\n\n18:48.280 --> 18:50.480\n like theoretical computer science, right?\n\n18:50.480 --> 18:52.320\n And it's still way out of my reach\n\n18:52.320 --> 18:54.960\n and so many people talk about like Langlands, for example,\n\n18:54.960 --> 18:57.640\n is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics\n\n18:57.640 --> 18:59.960\n and just really admire his work\n\n18:59.960 --> 19:03.720\n and I can't, it's like almost I can't hear the music\n\n19:03.720 --> 19:05.820\n that he composed and it makes me sad.\n\n19:05.820 --> 19:09.000\n Yeah, well, I mean, I think unfortunately,\n\n19:09.000 --> 19:13.200\n it's not just you, it's I think even most mathematicians\n\n19:13.200 --> 19:15.080\n have no, really don't actually understand\n\n19:15.080 --> 19:15.920\n what this is about.\n\n19:15.920 --> 19:19.400\n I mean, the group of people who really understand\n\n19:19.400 --> 19:21.040\n all these ideas and so for instance,\n\n19:21.040 --> 19:24.040\n this paper of Schultz and Farg that I was talking about,\n\n19:24.040 --> 19:26.320\n the number of people who really actually understand\n\n19:26.320 --> 19:31.000\n how that works is anyway, very, very small\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:35.200\n and so I think even you find if you talk to mathematicians\n\n19:35.200 --> 19:38.000\n and physicists, even they will often feel that,\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:40.320\n there's this really interesting sounding stuff going on\n\n19:40.320 --> 19:42.840\n and which I should be able to understand,\n\n19:42.840 --> 19:44.960\n it's kind of in my own field, I have a PhD in\n\n19:44.960 --> 19:48.360\n but it still seems pretty clearly far beyond me right now.\n\n19:49.780 --> 19:52.640\n Well, if we can step into the back to the question\n\n19:52.640 --> 19:56.320\n of beauty, is there an idea that maybe\n\n19:56.320 --> 19:59.560\n is a little bit smaller that you find beautiful\n\n19:59.560 --> 20:02.040\n in the space of mathematics or physics?\n\n20:02.040 --> 20:05.320\n There's an idea that I kind of went, got a physics PhD\n\n20:05.320 --> 20:07.120\n and spent a lot of time learning about mathematics\n\n20:07.120 --> 20:10.000\n and I guess it was embarrassing\n\n20:10.000 --> 20:11.720\n that I hadn't really actually understand\n\n20:11.720 --> 20:15.560\n this very simple idea until I kind of learned it\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:18.160\n when I actually started teaching math classes,\n\n20:18.160 --> 20:23.160\n which is maybe that there's a simple way\n\n20:23.320 --> 20:24.840\n to explain kind of the fundamental way\n\n20:24.840 --> 20:28.080\n in which algebra and geometry are connected.\n\n20:28.080 --> 20:31.680\n So you normally think of geometry as about these spaces\n\n20:31.680 --> 20:35.000\n and these points and you think of algebra\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.800\n as this very abstract thing about these abstract objects\n\n20:38.800 --> 20:40.680\n that satisfy certain kinds of relations,\n\n20:40.680 --> 20:44.360\n you can multiply them and add them and do stuff\n\n20:44.360 --> 20:45.960\n but it's completely abstract,\n\n20:45.960 --> 20:47.720\n there's nothing geometric about it\n\n20:47.720 --> 20:51.680\n but the kind of really fundamental idea\n\n20:51.680 --> 20:54.680\n is that unifies algebra and geometry\n\n20:54.680 --> 20:58.800\n is to think whenever anybody gives you\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:01.920\n what you call an algebra, some abstract thing\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:04.280\n of things that you can multiply and add\n\n21:04.280 --> 21:06.400\n that you should ask yourself,\n\n21:06.400 --> 21:10.640\n is that algebra the space of functions on some geometry?\n\n21:10.640 --> 21:12.560\n So one of the most surprising examples of this,\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:16.840\n for instance, is a standard kind of thing\n\n21:16.840 --> 21:18.640\n that seems to have nothing to do with geometry\n\n21:18.640 --> 21:21.920\n is the integers.\n\n21:21.920 --> 21:26.920\n So you can multiply them and add them, it's an algebra\n\n21:26.920 --> 21:31.000\n but it seems to have nothing to do with geometry\n\n21:31.000 --> 21:32.160\n but what you can, it turns out,\n\n21:32.160 --> 21:33.720\n but if you ask yourself this question\n\n21:33.720 --> 21:36.240\n and ask, you know, are integers,\n\n21:36.240 --> 21:37.760\n can you think, if somebody gives you an integer,\n\n21:37.760 --> 21:40.800\n can you think of it as a function on some space,\n\n21:40.800 --> 21:42.200\n on some geometry?\n\n21:42.200 --> 21:44.280\n And it turns out that yes, you can\n\n21:44.280 --> 21:47.240\n and the space is the space of prime numbers\n\n21:47.240 --> 21:48.600\n and so what you do is you just,\n\n21:48.600 --> 21:50.400\n if somebody gives you an integer,\n\n21:50.400 --> 21:53.120\n you can make a function on the prime numbers\n\n21:53.120 --> 21:56.960\n by just, you know, at each prime number taking that,\n\n21:56.960 --> 21:58.880\n that integer modulo that prime.\n\n21:58.880 --> 22:02.480\n So if you say, I don't know, if you're given 10,\n\n22:02.480 --> 22:05.560\n you know, 10 and you ask, what is its value at two?\n\n22:05.560 --> 22:09.600\n Well, it's five times two, so mod two, it's zero,\n\n22:09.600 --> 22:10.640\n so it's zero one.\n\n22:10.640 --> 22:13.640\n What is its value at three?\n\n22:13.640 --> 22:17.400\n Well, it's nine plus one, so it's one mod three.\n\n22:17.400 --> 22:19.920\n So it's zero at two, it's one at three\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:21.880\n and you can kind of keep going.\n\n22:21.880 --> 22:26.880\n And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea.\n\n22:26.960 --> 22:29.240\n It's at the basis of what's called algebraic geometry\n\n22:29.240 --> 22:31.400\n and it just links these two parts of mathematics\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:32.920\n that look completely different\n\n22:32.920 --> 22:35.120\n and it's just an incredibly powerful idea\n\n22:35.120 --> 22:37.240\n and so much of mathematics emerges\n\n22:37.240 --> 22:39.760\n from this kind of simple relation.\n\n22:39.760 --> 22:41.760\n So you're talking about mapping\n\n22:41.760 --> 22:44.720\n from one discrete space to another.\n\n22:44.720 --> 22:49.600\n So for a second, I thought perhaps mapping\n\n22:49.600 --> 22:51.600\n like a continuous space to a discrete space,\n\n22:51.600 --> 22:56.320\n like functions over a continuous space, because yeah.\n\n22:56.320 --> 23:00.000\n Well, I mean, you can take, if somebody gives you a space,\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:03.200\n you can ask, you can say, well, let's,\n\n23:03.200 --> 23:05.240\n and this is also, this is part of the same idea.\n\n23:05.240 --> 23:07.000\n The part of the same idea is that if you try\n\n23:07.000 --> 23:10.560\n and do geometry and somebody tells you, here's a space,\n\n23:10.560 --> 23:11.920\n that what you should do is you should wait,\n\n23:11.920 --> 23:12.760\n so say, wait a minute,\n\n23:12.760 --> 23:15.760\n maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra.\n\n23:15.760 --> 23:18.280\n And so if I do that, the way to start is,\n\n23:18.280 --> 23:19.680\n you give me the space,\n\n23:19.680 --> 23:22.800\n I start to think about the functions of the space, okay?\n\n23:22.800 --> 23:26.160\n So for each point in the space, I associate a number.\n\n23:26.160 --> 23:27.600\n I can take different kinds of functions\n\n23:27.600 --> 23:29.080\n and different kinds of values,\n\n23:29.080 --> 23:31.560\n but basically functions on a space.\n\n23:31.560 --> 23:36.280\n So what this insight is telling you is that\n\n23:36.280 --> 23:39.640\n if you're a geometer, often the way to work\n\n23:39.640 --> 23:41.920\n is to change your problem into algebra\n\n23:41.920 --> 23:44.840\n by changing your space, stop thinking about your space\n\n23:44.840 --> 23:47.640\n and the points in it and think about the functions on it.\n\n23:47.640 --> 23:49.760\n And if you're an algebraist\n\n23:49.760 --> 23:52.240\n and you've got these abstract algebraic gadgets\n\n23:52.240 --> 23:55.080\n that you're multiplying and adding, say, wait a minute,\n\n23:55.080 --> 23:58.520\n are those gadgets, can I think of them in some way\n\n23:58.520 --> 23:59.680\n as a function on a space?\n\n23:59.680 --> 24:00.760\n What would that space be\n\n24:00.760 --> 24:02.880\n and what kind of functions would they be?\n\n24:02.880 --> 24:05.720\n And that going back and forth really brings\n\n24:05.720 --> 24:08.200\n these two completely different looking areas\n\n24:08.200 --> 24:09.600\n of mathematics together.\n\n24:09.600 --> 24:13.400\n Do you have particular examples where it allowed\n\n24:13.400 --> 24:15.000\n to prove some difficult things\n\n24:15.000 --> 24:16.760\n by jumping from one to the other?\n\n24:16.760 --> 24:19.680\n Is that something that's a part of modern mathematics\n\n24:19.680 --> 24:21.680\n where such jumps are made?\n\n24:21.680 --> 24:23.720\n Oh yeah, this is kind of all the time.\n\n24:23.720 --> 24:27.160\n Much of modern number theory is kind of based on this idea.\n\n24:27.160 --> 24:29.880\n But, and when you start doing this,\n\n24:29.880 --> 24:31.640\n you start to realize that you need,\n\n24:32.880 --> 24:37.520\n what simple things on one side of the algebra\n\n24:37.520 --> 24:40.920\n start to require you to think about the other side,\n\n24:40.920 --> 24:42.360\n about geometry in a new way.\n\n24:42.360 --> 24:44.120\n You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea\n\n24:44.120 --> 24:46.960\n about geometry, or if you start thinking\n\n24:46.960 --> 24:49.120\n about the functions on a space,\n\n24:49.120 --> 24:52.040\n you may need a more sophisticated kind of algebra.\n\n24:52.040 --> 24:53.960\n But in some sense, I mean,\n\n24:53.960 --> 24:55.560\n much or most of modern number theory\n\n24:55.560 --> 24:58.920\n is based upon this move to geometry.\n\n24:58.920 --> 25:01.240\n And there's also a lot of geometry\n\n25:01.240 --> 25:05.040\n and topology is also based upon, yeah, change.\n\n25:05.040 --> 25:06.800\n If you want to understand the topology of something,\n\n25:06.800 --> 25:09.480\n you look at the functions, you do drum comology\n\n25:09.480 --> 25:11.360\n and you get the topology.\n\n25:12.400 --> 25:13.640\n Anyway.\n\n25:13.640 --> 25:16.200\n Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question.\n\n25:16.200 --> 25:18.960\n You said that this idea is beautiful.\n\n25:18.960 --> 25:22.680\n Can you formalize the definition of the word beautiful?\n\n25:22.680 --> 25:24.880\n And why is this beautiful?\n\n25:24.880 --> 25:26.240\n First, why is this beautiful?\n\n25:26.240 --> 25:29.720\n And second, what is beautiful?\n\n25:29.720 --> 25:32.320\n Yeah, well, and I think there are many different things\n\n25:32.320 --> 25:34.120\n you can find beautiful for different reasons.\n\n25:34.120 --> 25:37.900\n I mean, I think in this context, the notion of beauty,\n\n25:37.900 --> 25:41.280\n I think really is just kind of an idea is beautiful\n\n25:41.280 --> 25:45.720\n if it's packages a huge amount of kind of power\n\n25:45.720 --> 25:48.800\n and information into something very simple.\n\n25:48.800 --> 25:53.800\n So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it\n\n25:54.640 --> 25:58.320\n in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?\n\n25:58.320 --> 26:00.880\n What non trivial things does it tell you\n\n26:00.880 --> 26:05.880\n versus how simply can you express the idea?\n\n26:06.320 --> 26:07.160\n And so.\n\n26:07.160 --> 26:08.520\n So the level of compression,\n\n26:08.520 --> 26:12.400\n what is it correlates with beauty?\n\n26:12.400 --> 26:15.000\n Yeah, that's one aspect of it.\n\n26:15.000 --> 26:16.800\n And so you can start to tell that an idea\n\n26:16.800 --> 26:18.840\n is becoming uglier and uglier\n\n26:18.840 --> 26:21.280\n as you start kind of having to,\n\n26:21.280 --> 26:22.360\n it doesn't quite do what you want.\n\n26:22.360 --> 26:24.560\n So you throw in something else to the idea\n\n26:24.560 --> 26:27.360\n and you keep doing that until you get what you want.\n\n26:27.360 --> 26:29.560\n But that's how you know you're doing something uglier\n\n26:29.560 --> 26:31.960\n and uglier when you have to kind of keep adding\n\n26:31.960 --> 26:36.960\n and more into what was originally a fairly simple idea\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:40.380\n and making it more and more complicated\n\n26:40.380 --> 26:41.820\n to get what you want.\n\n26:41.820 --> 26:45.340\n Okay, so let's put some philosophical words on the table\n\n26:45.340 --> 26:47.100\n and try to make some sense of them.\n\n26:47.100 --> 26:49.780\n One word is beauty, another one is simplicity\n\n26:49.780 --> 26:52.220\n as you mentioned, another one is truth.\n\n26:53.300 --> 26:57.060\n So do you have a sense if I give you two theories,\n\n26:57.060 --> 27:01.380\n one is simpler, one is more complicated.\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:05.820\n Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true\n\n27:05.820 --> 27:10.820\n to capture deeply the fabric of reality,\n\n27:13.240 --> 27:15.340\n the simple one or the more complicated one?\n\n27:15.340 --> 27:17.660\n Yeah, I think all of our evidence,\n\n27:18.540 --> 27:20.100\n what we see in the history of the subject\n\n27:20.100 --> 27:22.380\n is the simpler one though.\n\n27:22.380 --> 27:26.300\n Often it's a surprise, it's simpler in a surprising way.\n\n27:26.300 --> 27:29.820\n But yeah, that we just don't, we just,\n\n27:31.100 --> 27:32.980\n anyway, the kind of best theories\n\n27:32.980 --> 27:35.460\n we've been coming up with are ultimately\n\n27:35.460 --> 27:38.740\n when properly understood, relatively simple\n\n27:38.740 --> 27:41.860\n and much, much simpler than you would expect them to be.\n\n27:41.860 --> 27:43.500\n Do you have a good explanation why that is?\n\n27:43.500 --> 27:46.020\n Is it just because humans want it to be that way?\n\n27:46.020 --> 27:47.540\n Are we just like ultra biased\n\n27:47.540 --> 27:51.080\n and we just kind of convince ourselves\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:53.720\n that simple is better because we find simplicity beautiful?\n\n27:53.720 --> 27:57.340\n Or is there something about our actual universe\n\n27:57.340 --> 28:00.060\n that at the core is simple?\n\n28:00.060 --> 28:02.980\n My own belief is that there is something about a universe\n\n28:02.980 --> 28:05.580\n that's simple and as I was trying to say that,\n\n28:05.580 --> 28:08.020\n there is some kind of fundamental thing about math,\n\n28:08.020 --> 28:13.020\n physics and all this picture, which is in some sense simple.\n\n28:14.500 --> 28:18.580\n It's true that, it's of course true that our minds\n\n28:18.580 --> 28:20.840\n have certain, are very limited\n\n28:20.840 --> 28:23.680\n and can certainly do certain things and not others.\n\n28:23.680 --> 28:26.500\n So it's in principle possible\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:29.380\n that there's some great insight in,\n\n28:29.380 --> 28:31.300\n there are a lot of insights into the way the world works,\n\n28:31.300 --> 28:33.460\n which just aren't accessible to us because\n\n28:33.460 --> 28:35.500\n that's not the way our minds work, we don't.\n\n28:35.500 --> 28:37.340\n And that what we're seeing, this kind of simplicity\n\n28:37.340 --> 28:41.300\n is just because that's all we ever have any hope of seeing.\n\n28:42.540 --> 28:46.120\n So there's a brilliant physicist\n\n28:46.120 --> 28:49.060\n by the name of Sabine Hassenfelder\n\n28:49.060 --> 28:51.060\n who both agrees and disagrees with you.\n\n28:51.060 --> 28:56.060\n I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple.\n\n28:57.260 --> 28:58.420\n Yeah.\n\n28:58.420 --> 29:01.580\n But simplicity and beauty leads us astray\n\n29:01.580 --> 29:04.840\n in the local pockets of scientific progress.\n\n29:05.900 --> 29:08.660\n Do you agree with her disagreement\n\n29:08.660 --> 29:11.140\n and do you disagree with her agreement?\n\n29:11.140 --> 29:14.060\n And agree with the agreement and so on.\n\n29:14.060 --> 29:17.100\n Anyway, yes, I found it was really fascinating\n\n29:17.100 --> 29:19.420\n reading her book and anyway,\n\n29:19.420 --> 29:21.420\n I was finding disagreeing with a lot,\n\n29:21.420 --> 29:23.340\n but then at the end when she says yes,\n\n29:23.340 --> 29:26.580\n when we find, when we actually figure this out,\n\n29:26.580 --> 29:31.220\n it will be simple and okay, so we agree in the end.\n\n29:31.220 --> 29:32.860\n But does beauty lead us astray,\n\n29:32.860 --> 29:37.620\n which is the core thesis of her work in that book.\n\n29:37.620 --> 29:41.160\n I actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much.\n\n29:41.160 --> 29:42.660\n I don't think, and especially,\n\n29:42.660 --> 29:44.580\n and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her\n\n29:44.580 --> 29:47.180\n about sometimes the way she'll refer to math.\n\n29:47.180 --> 29:51.460\n And so the problem is, physicists and people in general\n\n29:51.460 --> 29:56.140\n just refer to it as math and they're often meaning\n\n29:56.140 --> 29:57.220\n not what I would call math,\n\n29:57.220 --> 29:59.160\n which is the interesting ideas of math,\n\n29:59.160 --> 30:03.260\n but just some complicated calculation.\n\n30:03.260 --> 30:08.260\n And so I guess my feeling about it is more that it's very,\n\n30:09.180 --> 30:11.120\n the problem with talking about simplicity\n\n30:11.120 --> 30:14.700\n and using simplicity as a guide is that it's very,\n\n30:16.140 --> 30:17.620\n it's very easy to fool yourself\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:22.620\n and it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea.\n\n30:23.340 --> 30:26.000\n You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great\n\n30:26.000 --> 30:26.980\n and you fall in love with it.\n\n30:26.980 --> 30:29.500\n And it's like any kind of love affair,\n\n30:29.500 --> 30:32.820\n it's very easy to believe that the object of your affections\n\n30:32.820 --> 30:35.300\n is much more beautiful than the others might think\n\n30:35.300 --> 30:36.660\n and that they really are.\n\n30:36.660 --> 30:39.380\n And that's very, very easy to do.\n\n30:39.380 --> 30:43.980\n So if you say, I'm just gonna pursue ideas about beauty\n\n30:43.980 --> 30:46.460\n and this and mathematics and this,\n\n30:46.460 --> 30:49.500\n it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think.\n\n30:50.740 --> 30:54.060\n And I think that's a lot of what the story\n\n30:54.060 --> 30:56.260\n she was thinking of about where people have gone astray,\n\n30:56.260 --> 30:59.100\n that I think it's, I would argue that it's more people,\n\n30:59.100 --> 31:01.960\n it's not that there was some simple, powerful,\n\n31:01.960 --> 31:03.660\n wonderful idea which they'd found\n\n31:03.660 --> 31:08.340\n and it turned out not to be useful,\n\n31:08.340 --> 31:10.340\n but it was more that they kind of fooled themselves\n\n31:10.340 --> 31:13.080\n that this was actually a better idea than it really was\n\n31:13.080 --> 31:15.180\n and that it was simpler and more beautiful\n\n31:15.180 --> 31:17.700\n than it really was, is a lot of the story.\n\n31:18.860 --> 31:20.700\n I see, so it's not that the simplicity of beauty\n\n31:20.700 --> 31:22.900\n leads us astray, it's just people are people\n\n31:22.900 --> 31:27.180\n and they fall in love with whatever idea they have\n\n31:27.180 --> 31:30.260\n and then they weave narratives around that idea\n\n31:30.260 --> 31:31.540\n or they present it in such a way\n\n31:31.540 --> 31:36.540\n that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty.\n\n31:36.740 --> 31:37.960\n Yeah, that's part of it.\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:40.840\n But I mean, the thing about physics that you have\n\n31:40.840 --> 31:44.160\n is that what really can tell,\n\n31:44.160 --> 31:46.140\n if you can do an experiment and check\n\n31:46.140 --> 31:50.840\n and see if nature is really doing what your idea expects,\n\n31:50.840 --> 31:54.020\n you do in principle have a way of really testing it\n\n31:54.020 --> 31:58.380\n and it's certainly true that if you thought\n\n31:58.380 --> 32:00.160\n you had a simple idea and that doesn't work\n\n32:00.160 --> 32:01.900\n and you go out and do an experiment\n\n32:01.900 --> 32:04.120\n and what actually does work is some more,\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:05.900\n maybe some more complicated version of it,\n\n32:05.900 --> 32:10.780\n that can certainly happen and that can be true.\n\n32:10.780 --> 32:13.140\n I think her emphasis is more,\n\n32:13.140 --> 32:14.580\n that I don't really disagree with,\n\n32:14.580 --> 32:18.820\n is that people should be concentrating\n\n32:18.820 --> 32:21.980\n on when they're trying to develop better theories\n\n32:21.980 --> 32:25.740\n on more on self consistency, not so much on beauty,\n\n32:25.740 --> 32:28.300\n but not is this idea beautiful,\n\n32:28.300 --> 32:30.400\n but is there something about the theory\n\n32:30.400 --> 32:34.420\n which is not quite consistent and use that as a guide\n\n32:35.340 --> 32:37.980\n that there's something wrong there which needs fixing.\n\n32:37.980 --> 32:40.700\n And so I think that part of her argument,\n\n32:40.700 --> 32:43.220\n I think we're on the same page about.\n\n32:43.220 --> 32:48.220\n What is consistency and inconsistencies?\n\n32:48.300 --> 32:53.000\n What exactly, do you have examples in mind?\n\n32:53.000 --> 32:55.700\n Well, it can be just simple inconsistency\n\n32:55.700 --> 32:58.700\n between theory and an experiment that if you,\n\n32:58.700 --> 33:01.000\n so we have this great fundamental theory,\n\n33:01.000 --> 33:02.980\n but there are some things that we see out there\n\n33:02.980 --> 33:04.260\n which don't seem to fit in it,\n\n33:04.260 --> 33:07.500\n like dark energy and dark matter, for instance.\n\n33:07.500 --> 33:09.600\n But if there's something which you can't test experimentally,\n\n33:09.600 --> 33:12.020\n I think she would argue and I would agree\n\n33:12.020 --> 33:15.100\n that, for instance, if you're trying to think about gravity\n\n33:15.100 --> 33:17.380\n and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,\n\n33:17.380 --> 33:21.540\n you should kind of test any of your ideas\n\n33:21.540 --> 33:24.980\n with kind of a thought experiment.\n\n33:24.980 --> 33:26.780\n Does this actually give a consistent picture\n\n33:26.780 --> 33:28.740\n of what's gonna happen, of what happens\n\n33:28.740 --> 33:31.100\n in this particular situation or not?\n\n33:32.300 --> 33:33.460\n So this is a good example.\n\n33:33.460 --> 33:34.760\n You've written about this.\n\n33:36.460 --> 33:40.600\n Since quantum gravitational effects are really small,\n\n33:40.600 --> 33:44.260\n super small, arguably unobservably small,\n\n33:44.260 --> 33:46.480\n should we have hope to arrive\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:49.580\n at a theory of quantum gravity somehow?\n\n33:49.580 --> 33:51.540\n What are the different ways we can get there?\n\n33:51.540 --> 33:53.340\n You've mentioned that you're not as interested\n\n33:53.340 --> 33:56.940\n in that effort because basically, yes,\n\n33:56.940 --> 34:01.940\n you cannot have ways to scientifically validate it\n\n34:02.500 --> 34:04.160\n given the tools of today.\n\n34:04.160 --> 34:06.460\n Yeah, I've actually, you know, I've over the years\n\n34:06.460 --> 34:08.900\n certainly spent a lot of time learning about gravity\n\n34:08.900 --> 34:11.940\n and about attempts to quantize it, but it hasn't been\n\n34:11.940 --> 34:14.060\n that much in the past the focus\n\n34:14.060 --> 34:16.000\n of what I've been thinking about.\n\n34:16.000 --> 34:18.720\n But I mean, my feeling was always, you know,\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:22.880\n as I think Sabina would agree that the, you know,\n\n34:22.880 --> 34:25.800\n one way you can pursue this if you can't do experiments\n\n34:25.800 --> 34:29.140\n is just this kind of search for consistency.\n\n34:29.140 --> 34:31.840\n You know, it can be remarkably hard to come up\n\n34:31.840 --> 34:34.980\n with a completely consistent model of this\n\n34:34.980 --> 34:37.420\n in a way that brings together quantum mechanics\n\n34:37.420 --> 34:39.420\n and general relativity.\n\n34:39.420 --> 34:42.700\n And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional way\n\n34:42.700 --> 34:44.440\n that people who have pursued quantum gravity\n\n34:44.440 --> 34:46.340\n have often pursued, you know,\n\n34:48.340 --> 34:52.420\n we have the best route to finding a consistent theory\n\n34:52.420 --> 34:55.740\n of quantum gravity and string theorists will tell you this,\n\n34:55.740 --> 34:57.120\n other people will tell you it,\n\n34:57.120 --> 35:00.060\n it's kind of what people argue about.\n\n35:00.060 --> 35:03.340\n But the problem with all of that is that you end up,\n\n35:03.340 --> 35:07.060\n you know, the danger is that you end up with,\n\n35:08.620 --> 35:10.140\n that everybody could be successful.\n\n35:10.140 --> 35:14.620\n Everybody's program for how to find a theory\n\n35:14.620 --> 35:16.540\n of quantum gravity, you know, ends up with something\n\n35:16.540 --> 35:18.500\n that is consistent.\n\n35:18.500 --> 35:20.780\n And so, and in some sense you could argue\n\n35:20.780 --> 35:23.860\n this is what happened to the string theorists.\n\n35:23.860 --> 35:26.300\n They solved their problem of finding a consistent theory\n\n35:26.300 --> 35:27.800\n of quantum gravity and they ended up,\n\n35:27.800 --> 35:30.300\n but they found 10 to the 500 solutions.\n\n35:30.300 --> 35:34.620\n So you, you know, if you believe that everything\n\n35:34.620 --> 35:35.980\n that they would like to be true is true,\n\n35:35.980 --> 35:38.380\n well, okay, you've got a theory,\n\n35:38.380 --> 35:41.100\n but it ends up being kind of useless\n\n35:41.100 --> 35:43.860\n because it's just one of an infinite,\n\n35:43.860 --> 35:46.060\n essentially infinite number of things\n\n35:46.060 --> 35:48.340\n which you have no way to experimentally distinguish.\n\n35:48.340 --> 35:51.300\n And so this is just a depressing situation.\n\n35:52.220 --> 35:55.260\n But I do think that there is a,\n\n35:55.260 --> 35:57.780\n so again, I think pursuing ideas about what,\n\n35:57.780 --> 36:01.380\n more about beauty and how can you integrate\n\n36:01.380 --> 36:04.340\n and unify these issues about gravity\n\n36:04.340 --> 36:06.020\n with other things we know about physics.\n\n36:06.020 --> 36:08.860\n And can you find a theory where these fit together\n\n36:08.860 --> 36:12.340\n in a way that makes sense and hopefully predict something.\n\n36:12.340 --> 36:14.020\n That's much more promising.\n\n36:14.020 --> 36:15.620\n Well, it makes sense and hopefully,\n\n36:15.620 --> 36:19.620\n I mean, we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times\n\n36:19.620 --> 36:23.540\n because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things\n\n36:23.540 --> 36:27.220\n which is like, it's nice to have a theory that's consistent,\n\n36:27.220 --> 36:29.940\n but then if the theory is consistent,\n\n36:29.940 --> 36:31.780\n it doesn't necessarily mean anything.\n\n36:32.860 --> 36:33.700\n So like.\n\n36:33.700 --> 36:35.220\n It's not enough, it's not enough.\n\n36:35.220 --> 36:36.780\n It's not enough and that's the problem.\n\n36:36.780 --> 36:39.460\n So it's like, it keeps coming back to,\n\n36:39.460 --> 36:42.060\n okay, there should be some experimental validation.\n\n36:43.380 --> 36:47.020\n So, okay, let's talk a little bit about strength theory.\n\n36:47.020 --> 36:51.340\n You've been a bit of an outspoken critic of strength theory.\n\n36:52.420 --> 36:56.680\n Maybe one question first to ask is what is strength theory?\n\n36:56.680 --> 37:01.680\n And beyond that, why is it wrong?\n\n37:01.900 --> 37:06.540\n Or rather as the title of your blog says, not even wrong.\n\n37:06.540 --> 37:07.900\n Okay.\n\n37:07.900 --> 37:08.740\n Well, one interesting thing\n\n37:08.740 --> 37:10.380\n about the current state of strength theory is that,\n\n37:10.380 --> 37:13.340\n I think it, I'd argue it's actually very, very difficult\n\n37:13.340 --> 37:15.880\n to at this point to say what strength theory means.\n\n37:15.880 --> 37:17.380\n If people say they're a strength theorist,\n\n37:17.380 --> 37:19.820\n what they mean and what they're doing\n\n37:19.820 --> 37:24.140\n is kind of hard to pin down the meaning of the term.\n\n37:24.140 --> 37:26.800\n But the initial meaning I think goes back to,\n\n37:28.380 --> 37:32.100\n there was kind of a series of developments starting in 1984\n\n37:32.100 --> 37:36.420\n in which people felt that they had found a unified theory\n\n37:36.420 --> 37:41.300\n of our so called standard model of all the standard,\n\n37:41.300 --> 37:44.620\n well known kind of particle interactions and gravity\n\n37:44.620 --> 37:46.620\n and it all fit together in a quantum theory.\n\n37:46.620 --> 37:49.940\n And that you could do this in a very specific way\n\n37:49.940 --> 37:54.900\n by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:57.200\n of particles moving around in space time,\n\n37:57.200 --> 38:00.380\n think about a quantum theory of kind of one dimensional\n\n38:00.380 --> 38:03.420\n loops moving around in space time, so called strings.\n\n38:03.420 --> 38:06.580\n And so instead of one degree of freedom,\n\n38:06.580 --> 38:08.220\n these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom.\n\n38:08.220 --> 38:11.060\n It's a much more complicated theory, but you can imagine,\n\n38:12.300 --> 38:14.780\n okay, we're gonna quantize this theory of loops\n\n38:14.780 --> 38:16.780\n moving around in space time.\n\n38:16.780 --> 38:21.160\n And what they found is that you could do this\n\n38:21.160 --> 38:23.420\n and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly\n\n38:23.420 --> 38:26.900\n make sense of such a quantum theory,\n\n38:26.900 --> 38:30.660\n but only if space and time together were 10 dimensional.\n\n38:31.580 --> 38:32.980\n And so then you had this problem,\n\n38:32.980 --> 38:34.820\n again, the problem I referred to at the beginning of,\n\n38:34.820 --> 38:37.260\n okay, now once you make that move,\n\n38:37.260 --> 38:39.620\n you gotta get rid of six dimensions.\n\n38:39.620 --> 38:42.300\n And so the hope was that you could get rid\n\n38:42.300 --> 38:44.820\n of the six dimensions by making them very small\n\n38:44.820 --> 38:47.460\n and that consistency of the theory would require\n\n38:48.740 --> 38:52.860\n that these six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition\n\n38:52.860 --> 38:55.180\n called being a Calabi out manifold.\n\n38:55.180 --> 38:58.300\n And that we knew very, very few examples of this.\n\n38:58.300 --> 39:02.340\n So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85\n\n39:02.340 --> 39:05.180\n was the hope that you could just take\n\n39:05.180 --> 39:07.060\n this 10 dimensional string theory\n\n39:07.060 --> 39:10.900\n and find one of a limited number of possible ways\n\n39:10.900 --> 39:14.620\n of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small\n\n39:14.620 --> 39:16.700\n and then you would end up with an effective\n\n39:16.700 --> 39:18.820\n four dimensional theory, which looked like the real world.\n\n39:18.820 --> 39:20.020\n This was the hope.\n\n39:20.020 --> 39:22.580\n So then there's then a very long story\n\n39:22.580 --> 39:25.900\n about what happened to that hope over the years.\n\n39:25.900 --> 39:28.780\n I would argue and part of the point of the book\n\n39:28.780 --> 39:33.780\n and its title was that this ultimately was a failure\n\n39:33.900 --> 39:36.460\n that you ended up, that this idea just didn't,\n\n39:38.940 --> 39:41.060\n there ended up being just too many ways of doing this\n\n39:41.060 --> 39:44.100\n and you didn't know how to do this consistently,\n\n39:44.100 --> 39:46.740\n that it was kind of not even wrong in the sense\n\n39:46.740 --> 39:49.140\n that you couldn't even, you never could pin it down\n\n39:49.140 --> 39:53.580\n well enough to actually get a real falsifiable prediction\n\n39:53.580 --> 39:55.220\n out of it that would tell you it was wrong.\n\n39:55.220 --> 39:59.340\n But it was kind of in the realm of ideas\n\n39:59.340 --> 40:02.100\n which initially looked good, but the more you look at them,\n\n40:02.100 --> 40:05.460\n they just, they don't work out the way you want\n\n40:05.460 --> 40:07.740\n and they don't actually end up carrying the power\n\n40:07.740 --> 40:10.220\n or that you originally had this vision of.\n\n40:10.220 --> 40:14.180\n And yes, the book title is not even wrong.\n\n40:14.180 --> 40:17.780\n Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong.\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:20.900\n Okay, but there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement\n\n40:20.900 --> 40:24.180\n about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned.\n\n40:24.180 --> 40:27.860\n What are the different flavors of ideas that came,\n\n40:29.420 --> 40:31.340\n like that branched out?\n\n40:31.340 --> 40:32.700\n You mentioned 10 dimensions.\n\n40:32.700 --> 40:36.540\n You mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom.\n\n40:36.540 --> 40:38.780\n What other interesting ideas to you\n\n40:38.780 --> 40:41.020\n that kind of emerged from this world?\n\n40:41.020 --> 40:42.020\n Well, yeah, I mean, the problem\n\n40:42.020 --> 40:43.260\n with talking about the whole subject\n\n40:43.260 --> 40:45.740\n and part of the reason I wrote the book\n\n40:45.740 --> 40:48.740\n is that it gets very, very complicated.\n\n40:48.740 --> 40:50.380\n I mean, there's a huge amount,\n\n40:52.100 --> 40:54.460\n a lot of people got very interested in this,\n\n40:54.460 --> 40:55.580\n a lot of people worked on it.\n\n40:55.580 --> 40:57.900\n And in some sense, I think what happened\n\n40:57.900 --> 41:01.340\n is exactly because the idea didn't really work\n\n41:01.340 --> 41:03.580\n that this caused people to,\n\n41:04.540 --> 41:06.220\n instead of focusing on this one idea\n\n41:06.220 --> 41:08.220\n and digging in and working on that,\n\n41:08.220 --> 41:11.020\n they just kind of kept trying new things.\n\n41:11.020 --> 41:14.020\n And so people, I think, ended up wandering around\n\n41:14.020 --> 41:15.860\n in a very, very rich space of ideas\n\n41:15.860 --> 41:17.660\n about mathematics and physics\n\n41:17.660 --> 41:19.980\n and discovering all sorts of really interesting things.\n\n41:19.980 --> 41:22.020\n It's just the problem is there tended\n\n41:22.020 --> 41:23.380\n to be an inverse relationship\n\n41:23.380 --> 41:26.100\n between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful\n\n41:26.100 --> 41:28.820\n this new idea that they were trying to pursue was\n\n41:28.820 --> 41:31.820\n and how much it looked like the real world.\n\n41:31.820 --> 41:34.500\n So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it.\n\n41:34.500 --> 41:36.020\n I think one of the most spectacular\n\n41:36.020 --> 41:38.340\n is what the physicists call\n\n41:38.340 --> 41:40.620\n two dimensional conformal field theory.\n\n41:40.620 --> 41:44.620\n And so these are basically quantum field theories\n\n41:44.620 --> 41:46.300\n and kind of think of it as one space\n\n41:46.300 --> 41:47.780\n and one time dimension,\n\n41:47.780 --> 41:51.220\n which have just this huge amount of symmetry\n\n41:51.220 --> 41:53.620\n and a huge amount of structure,\n\n41:53.620 --> 41:57.420\n which there's some totally fantastic mathematics behind it.\n\n41:57.420 --> 42:00.340\n And again, and some of that mathematics\n\n42:00.340 --> 42:03.260\n is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program.\n\n42:03.260 --> 42:07.780\n So a lot of the first interaction between math and physics\n\n42:07.780 --> 42:09.140\n around the Langlands program has been\n\n42:09.140 --> 42:12.580\n around these two dimensional conformal field theories.\n\n42:12.580 --> 42:15.220\n Is there something you could say\n\n42:15.220 --> 42:18.980\n about what are the major problems are with string theory?\n\n42:18.980 --> 42:23.980\n So like, besides that there's no experimental validation,\n\n42:25.820 --> 42:30.420\n you've written that a big hole in string theory\n\n42:30.420 --> 42:33.380\n has been its perturbative definition.\n\n42:34.500 --> 42:36.940\n Perhaps that's one, can you explain what that means?\n\n42:36.940 --> 42:38.140\n Well, maybe to begin with,\n\n42:38.140 --> 42:40.780\n I think the simplest thing to say is,\n\n42:42.580 --> 42:45.220\n the initial idea really was that,\n\n42:45.220 --> 42:48.380\n okay, we have this, instead of what's great\n\n42:48.380 --> 42:50.740\n is we have this thing that only works,\n\n42:50.740 --> 42:54.180\n it's very structured and has to work in a certain way\n\n42:54.180 --> 42:55.540\n for it to make sense.\n\n42:55.540 --> 43:00.540\n But then you ended up in 10 space time dimensions.\n\n43:01.700 --> 43:03.620\n And so to get back to physics,\n\n43:03.620 --> 43:05.380\n you had to get rid of five of the dimensions,\n\n43:05.380 --> 43:06.860\n six of the dimensions.\n\n43:06.860 --> 43:09.620\n And the bottom line I would say in some sense is very simple\n\n43:09.620 --> 43:11.660\n that what people just discovered is just,\n\n43:12.780 --> 43:15.660\n there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this,\n\n43:15.660 --> 43:17.460\n there's an infinite number of ways of doing it\n\n43:17.460 --> 43:18.740\n and you can get whatever you want\n\n43:18.740 --> 43:20.140\n depending on how you do it.\n\n43:20.140 --> 43:24.020\n So you end up the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions\n\n43:24.020 --> 43:26.780\n and getting to four just kind of collapses\n\n43:26.780 --> 43:29.740\n out of a lack of any way to kind of get to where you want\n\n43:29.740 --> 43:31.540\n because you can get anything.\n\n43:31.540 --> 43:34.380\n The hope around that problem has always been\n\n43:34.380 --> 43:38.940\n that the standard formulation that we have of string theory,\n\n43:38.940 --> 43:42.540\n which is, you can go by the name perturbative,\n\n43:42.540 --> 43:46.300\n but it's kind of, there's a standard way we know\n\n43:46.300 --> 43:50.700\n of given a classical theory of constructing a quantum theory\n\n43:50.700 --> 43:55.700\n and working with it, which is the so called\n\n43:56.100 --> 43:59.260\n perturbation theory that we know how to do.\n\n43:59.260 --> 44:04.260\n And that by itself just doesn't give you any hint\n\n44:04.460 --> 44:06.660\n as to what to do about the six dimensions.\n\n44:06.660 --> 44:09.180\n So actual perturbed string theory by itself\n\n44:09.180 --> 44:11.340\n really only works in 10 dimensions.\n\n44:11.340 --> 44:14.380\n So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions\n\n44:14.380 --> 44:19.380\n about how I'm gonna go beyond this formulation\n\n44:19.380 --> 44:21.700\n that we really understand of string theory\n\n44:21.700 --> 44:24.060\n and get rid of these six dimensions.\n\n44:24.060 --> 44:29.060\n So kind of the simplest one was the Klabiau postulate,\n\n44:29.380 --> 44:31.820\n but when that didn't really work out,\n\n44:31.820 --> 44:33.940\n people have tried more and more different things.\n\n44:33.940 --> 44:38.500\n And the hope has always been that the solution,\n\n44:38.500 --> 44:41.540\n this problem would be that you would find a deeper\n\n44:41.540 --> 44:44.220\n and better understanding of what string theory is\n\n44:44.220 --> 44:47.860\n that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion\n\n44:47.860 --> 44:51.820\n and which would generalize this.\n\n44:51.820 --> 44:56.820\n And that once you had that, it would solve this problem of,\n\n44:57.220 --> 44:59.580\n it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions.\n\n44:59.580 --> 45:01.140\n How difficult is this problem?\n\n45:01.140 --> 45:05.100\n So if I could restate the problem,\n\n45:05.100 --> 45:09.860\n it seems like there's a very consistent physical world\n\n45:09.860 --> 45:11.720\n operating in four dimensions.\n\n45:13.340 --> 45:16.700\n And how do you map a consistent physical world\n\n45:16.700 --> 45:19.260\n in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world\n\n45:19.260 --> 45:21.180\n in four dimensions?\n\n45:21.180 --> 45:23.100\n And how difficult is this problem?\n\n45:23.100 --> 45:25.340\n Is that something you can even answer?\n\n45:27.720 --> 45:30.340\n Just in terms of physics intuition,\n\n45:30.340 --> 45:32.280\n in terms of mathematics,\n\n45:32.280 --> 45:35.060\n mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions.\n\n45:35.060 --> 45:36.580\n Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid\n\n45:36.580 --> 45:38.140\n of the six of the dimensions.\n\n45:38.140 --> 45:41.620\n So there's kind of two ways of doing it.\n\n45:41.620 --> 45:44.020\n One is what we called compactification.\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:46.860\n You say that there really are 10 dimensions,\n\n45:46.860 --> 45:48.220\n but for whatever reason,\n\n45:48.220 --> 45:51.860\n six of them are so, so small, we can't see them.\n\n45:51.860 --> 45:54.660\n So you basically start out with 10 dimensions\n\n45:54.660 --> 45:58.980\n and what we call, make six of them not go out to infinity,\n\n45:58.980 --> 46:00.780\n but just kind of a finite extent\n\n46:00.780 --> 46:05.460\n and then make that size go down so small, it's unobservable.\n\n46:05.460 --> 46:08.300\n But that's like, that's a math trick.\n\n46:08.300 --> 46:11.420\n So can you also help me build an intuition\n\n46:11.420 --> 46:15.580\n about how rich and interesting the world\n\n46:15.580 --> 46:17.900\n in those six dimensions is?\n\n46:17.900 --> 46:21.020\n So compactification seems to imply...\n\n46:21.020 --> 46:22.660\n Well, it's not very interesting.\n\n46:22.660 --> 46:24.700\n Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:26.780\n if you start doing mathematics\n\n46:26.780 --> 46:28.900\n and looking at geometry and topology\n\n46:28.900 --> 46:31.600\n and more and more dimensions is that,\n\n46:31.600 --> 46:34.180\n I mean, asking the question like,\n\n46:34.180 --> 46:36.540\n what are all possible six dimensional spaces?\n\n46:36.540 --> 46:38.580\n It's just, it's kind of an unnatural question.\n\n46:38.580 --> 46:39.620\n It's just, I mean,\n\n46:39.620 --> 46:42.020\n it's even kind of technically undecidable in some way.\n\n46:42.020 --> 46:46.180\n There are too many things you can do with all these,\n\n46:46.180 --> 46:47.500\n if you start trying to make,\n\n46:47.500 --> 46:49.540\n if you start trying to make one dimensional spaces,\n\n46:49.540 --> 46:52.140\n it's like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle,\n\n46:52.140 --> 46:55.180\n you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do.\n\n46:55.180 --> 46:58.260\n But as you go to higher and higher dimensions,\n\n46:58.260 --> 47:02.140\n there are just so many ways you can put things together\n\n47:02.140 --> 47:05.460\n of and get something of that dimensionality.\n\n47:05.460 --> 47:09.820\n And so unless you have some very, very strong principle,\n\n47:09.820 --> 47:12.920\n we're just gonna pick out some very specific ones\n\n47:12.920 --> 47:15.400\n of these six dimensional spaces.\n\n47:15.400 --> 47:17.340\n And there are just too many of them\n\n47:17.340 --> 47:19.500\n and you can get anything you want.\n\n47:19.500 --> 47:21.600\n So if you have 10 dimensions,\n\n47:22.540 --> 47:24.460\n the kind of things that happen,\n\n47:24.460 --> 47:26.700\n say that's actually the way,\n\n47:26.700 --> 47:29.740\n that's actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions.\n\n47:29.740 --> 47:33.100\n There's a limited set of behaviors of objects.\n\n47:33.100 --> 47:35.180\n I don't know even know what the right terminology\n\n47:35.180 --> 47:39.380\n to use that can occur within those dimensions,\n\n47:39.380 --> 47:40.620\n like in reality.\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:44.540\n And so like what I'm getting at is like,\n\n47:44.540 --> 47:47.280\n is there some consistent constraints?\n\n47:47.280 --> 47:51.080\n So if you have some constraints that map to reality,\n\n47:51.080 --> 47:53.460\n then you can start saying like,\n\n47:53.460 --> 47:56.260\n dimension number seven is kind of boring.\n\n47:56.260 --> 47:58.900\n All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions,\n\n47:58.900 --> 48:00.380\n one, two, three.\n\n48:00.380 --> 48:02.740\n And time is also kind of boring.\n\n48:02.740 --> 48:05.380\n And like some are more exciting than others,\n\n48:05.380 --> 48:08.100\n or we can use our metric of beauty.\n\n48:08.100 --> 48:10.260\n Some dimensions are more beautiful than others.\n\n48:10.260 --> 48:12.260\n Once you have an actual understanding\n\n48:12.260 --> 48:15.280\n of what actually happens in those dimensions\n\n48:15.280 --> 48:16.500\n in our physical world,\n\n48:16.500 --> 48:18.620\n as opposed to sort of all the possible things\n\n48:18.620 --> 48:19.600\n that could happen.\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:20.660\n In some sense, I mean,\n\n48:20.660 --> 48:22.240\n just the basic fact is you need to get rid of them.\n\n48:22.240 --> 48:23.080\n We don't see them.\n\n48:23.080 --> 48:25.580\n So you need to somehow explain them.\n\n48:25.580 --> 48:26.580\n The main thing you're trying to do\n\n48:26.580 --> 48:28.820\n is to explain why we're not seeing them.\n\n48:28.820 --> 48:32.540\n And so you have to come up with some theory\n\n48:32.540 --> 48:35.420\n of these extra dimensions and how they're gonna behave.\n\n48:35.420 --> 48:38.180\n And string theory gives you some ideas\n\n48:38.180 --> 48:39.020\n about how to do that.\n\n48:39.020 --> 48:43.580\n But the bottom line is where you're trying to go\n\n48:43.580 --> 48:45.660\n with this whole theory you're creating\n\n48:45.660 --> 48:49.540\n is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable.\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:51.480\n So it's not a really,\n\n48:54.780 --> 48:57.300\n it's an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing\n\n48:57.300 --> 48:58.300\n that you're trying to do there.\n\n48:58.300 --> 49:00.600\n Why are you just adding in all this stuff\n\n49:00.600 --> 49:02.220\n and then trying to explain why we don't see it?\n\n49:02.220 --> 49:03.060\n Exactly.\n\n49:03.060 --> 49:04.260\n This may be a dumb question,\n\n49:04.260 --> 49:07.780\n but is this an obvious thing to state\n\n49:07.780 --> 49:11.580\n that those six dimensions are unobservable\n\n49:11.580 --> 49:14.720\n or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable?\n\n49:16.180 --> 49:19.540\n Or do you leave a little door open\n\n49:19.540 --> 49:23.180\n to saying the current tools of physics,\n\n49:23.180 --> 49:26.980\n and obviously our brains aren't unable to observe them,\n\n49:26.980 --> 49:29.940\n but we may need to come up with methodologies\n\n49:29.940 --> 49:30.780\n for observing them.\n\n49:30.780 --> 49:33.140\n So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory\n\n49:33.140 --> 49:35.020\n into four dimensions,\n\n49:35.020 --> 49:37.140\n leaving the door open a little bit too,\n\n49:37.140 --> 49:38.760\n maybe we need to come up with tools\n\n49:38.760 --> 49:42.700\n that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions.\n\n49:42.700 --> 49:45.260\n Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask,\n\n49:45.260 --> 49:49.200\n assume that we've got model,\n\n49:49.200 --> 49:51.340\n look at models with more dimensions and ask,\n\n49:51.340 --> 49:54.180\n what would the observable effects, how would we know this?\n\n49:54.180 --> 49:55.500\n And you go out and do experiments.\n\n49:55.500 --> 49:58.780\n So for instance, you have a,\n\n49:58.780 --> 50:02.660\n like gravitationally you have an inverse square law of forces.\n\n50:02.660 --> 50:04.100\n If you had more dimensions,\n\n50:04.100 --> 50:06.620\n that inverse square law would change to something else.\n\n50:06.620 --> 50:09.540\n So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law\n\n50:09.540 --> 50:12.060\n and say, okay, inverse square law is working,\n\n50:12.060 --> 50:14.660\n but maybe if I get,\n\n50:14.660 --> 50:16.540\n and it turns out to be actually kind of very, very hard\n\n50:16.540 --> 50:18.140\n to measure gravitational effects\n\n50:18.140 --> 50:21.940\n and even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances\n\n50:21.940 --> 50:23.300\n because they're so small.\n\n50:23.300 --> 50:26.220\n So you can start looking at the inverse square law\n\n50:26.220 --> 50:28.020\n and say, start trying to measure it\n\n50:28.020 --> 50:29.380\n at shorter and shorter distances\n\n50:29.380 --> 50:33.180\n and see if there were extra dimensions\n\n50:33.180 --> 50:34.440\n at those distance scales,\n\n50:34.440 --> 50:36.780\n you would start to see the inverse square law fail.\n\n50:36.780 --> 50:40.520\n And so people look for that and again, you don't see it,\n\n50:40.520 --> 50:43.220\n but you can, I mean, there's all sorts of experiments\n\n50:43.220 --> 50:46.580\n of this kind you can imagine which test\n\n50:46.580 --> 50:48.420\n for effects of extra dimensions\n\n50:48.420 --> 50:52.640\n at different distance scales, but none of them,\n\n50:53.860 --> 50:55.940\n I mean, they all just don't work.\n\n50:55.940 --> 50:58.220\n Nothing yet.\n\n50:58.220 --> 51:01.860\n Nothing yet, but you could say, ah, but it's just much,\n\n51:01.860 --> 51:03.700\n much smaller, you can say that.\n\n51:05.180 --> 51:06.900\n Which by the way makes LIGO\n\n51:06.900 --> 51:09.980\n and the detection of gravitational waves\n\n51:09.980 --> 51:11.640\n quite an incredible project.\n\n51:13.300 --> 51:15.680\n Ed Witten is often brought up\n\n51:15.680 --> 51:17.420\n as one of the most brilliant mathematicians\n\n51:17.420 --> 51:19.140\n and physicists ever.\n\n51:21.060 --> 51:24.460\n What do you make of him and his work on string theory?\n\n51:24.460 --> 51:26.820\n Well, I think he's a truly remarkable figure.\n\n51:26.820 --> 51:30.140\n I've had the pleasure of meeting him first\n\n51:30.140 --> 51:31.100\n when he was a postdoc.\n\n51:31.100 --> 51:34.780\n And I mean, he's just completely amazing\n\n51:36.060 --> 51:38.020\n mathematician and physicist.\n\n51:38.020 --> 51:41.460\n And he's quite a bit smarter\n\n51:41.460 --> 51:43.380\n than just about any of the rest of us\n\n51:43.380 --> 51:44.580\n and also more hardworking.\n\n51:44.580 --> 51:46.780\n It's a kind of frightening combination\n\n51:46.780 --> 51:49.180\n to see how much he's been able to do.\n\n51:50.540 --> 51:53.540\n But I would actually argue that his greatest work,\n\n51:53.540 --> 51:55.820\n the things that he's done that have been of\n\n51:55.820 --> 51:58.660\n just this mind blowing significance of giving us,\n\n51:58.660 --> 52:00.100\n I mean, he's completely revolutionized\n\n52:00.100 --> 52:02.180\n some areas of mathematics.\n\n52:02.180 --> 52:04.220\n He's totally revolutionized the way we understand\n\n52:04.220 --> 52:07.160\n the relations between mathematics and physics.\n\n52:07.160 --> 52:10.660\n And most of those, his greatest work\n\n52:10.660 --> 52:13.700\n is stuff that has little or nothing\n\n52:13.700 --> 52:15.140\n to do with string theory.\n\n52:15.140 --> 52:19.180\n I mean, for instance, so he was actually one of Fields.\n\n52:19.180 --> 52:20.920\n The very strange thing about him in some sense\n\n52:20.920 --> 52:23.660\n is that he doesn't have a Nobel Prize.\n\n52:23.660 --> 52:25.940\n So there's a very large number of people\n\n52:25.940 --> 52:28.300\n who are nowhere near as smart as he is\n\n52:28.300 --> 52:30.140\n and don't work anywhere near as hard\n\n52:30.140 --> 52:31.740\n who have Nobel Prizes.\n\n52:31.740 --> 52:33.180\n I think he just had the misfortune\n\n52:33.180 --> 52:35.820\n of coming into the field at a time\n\n52:35.820 --> 52:37.740\n when things had gotten much, much, much tougher\n\n52:37.740 --> 52:41.380\n and nobody really had, no matter how smart you were,\n\n52:41.380 --> 52:44.020\n it was very hard to come up with a new idea\n\n52:44.020 --> 52:47.740\n that was gonna work physically and get you a Nobel Prize.\n\n52:47.740 --> 52:52.740\n But he got a Fields Medal for a certain work he did\n\n52:52.980 --> 52:56.540\n in mathematics, and that's just completely unheard of.\n\n52:56.540 --> 52:58.380\n For mathematicians to give a Fields Medal\n\n52:58.380 --> 53:00.860\n to someone outside their field in physics\n\n53:00.860 --> 53:05.620\n is really, you wouldn't have, before he came around,\n\n53:05.620 --> 53:06.680\n I don't think anybody would have thought\n\n53:06.680 --> 53:08.040\n that was even conceivable.\n\n53:08.040 --> 53:11.020\n So you're saying he came into the field\n\n53:11.020 --> 53:13.700\n of theoretical physics at a time when,\n\n53:13.700 --> 53:18.240\n and still to today, is you can't get a Nobel Prize\n\n53:18.240 --> 53:20.200\n for purely theoretical work.\n\n53:20.200 --> 53:22.320\n The specific problem of trying to do better\n\n53:22.320 --> 53:23.880\n than the standard, the standard model\n\n53:23.880 --> 53:26.680\n is just this insanely successful thing,\n\n53:26.680 --> 53:30.600\n and it kind of came together in 1973, pretty much.\n\n53:30.600 --> 53:34.320\n And all of the people who kind of were involved\n\n53:34.320 --> 53:37.200\n in that coming together, many of them ended up\n\n53:37.200 --> 53:38.600\n with Nobel Prizes for that.\n\n53:38.600 --> 53:43.600\n But if you look post 1973, pretty much,\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:47.160\n it's a little bit more, there's some edge cases,\n\n53:47.160 --> 53:50.200\n if you like, but if you look post 1973\n\n53:50.200 --> 53:53.240\n at what people have done to try to do better\n\n53:53.240 --> 53:56.160\n than the standard model and to get a better idea,\n\n53:56.160 --> 53:58.440\n it really hasn't, it's been too hard a problem.\n\n53:58.440 --> 53:59.280\n It hasn't worked.\n\n53:59.280 --> 54:00.100\n The theory's too good.\n\n54:00.100 --> 54:03.320\n And so it's not that other people went out there\n\n54:03.320 --> 54:07.340\n and did it, and not him, and that they got Nobel Prizes\n\n54:07.340 --> 54:08.960\n for doing it, it's just that no one really,\n\n54:08.960 --> 54:10.480\n the kind of thing he's been trying to do\n\n54:10.480 --> 54:13.360\n with string theory is not, no one has been able to do\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:14.680\n since 1973.\n\n54:15.540 --> 54:17.380\n Is there something you can say about the standard model,\n\n54:17.380 --> 54:20.720\n so the four laws of physics that seems to work very well,\n\n54:20.720 --> 54:24.980\n and yet people are striving to do more?\n\n54:24.980 --> 54:27.580\n Talking about unification, so on, why?\n\n54:27.580 --> 54:30.900\n What's wrong, what's broken about the standard model?\n\n54:30.900 --> 54:33.080\n Why does it need to be improved?\n\n54:33.080 --> 54:34.880\n I mean, the thing that's gets most attention\n\n54:34.880 --> 54:38.220\n is gravity, that we have trouble.\n\n54:39.160 --> 54:44.120\n So you want to, in some sense, integrate what we know\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:46.320\n about the gravitational force with it\n\n54:46.320 --> 54:48.640\n and have a unified quantum field theory\n\n54:48.640 --> 54:50.340\n that has gravitational interactions also.\n\n54:50.340 --> 54:52.640\n So that's the big problem everybody talks about.\n\n54:53.640 --> 54:55.940\n I mean, but it's also true that if you look\n\n54:55.940 --> 54:58.380\n at the standard model, it has these very, very deep,\n\n54:58.380 --> 55:01.600\n beautiful ideas, but there's certain aspects of it\n\n55:01.600 --> 55:06.600\n that are very, let's just say that they're not beautiful.\n\n55:08.240 --> 55:11.440\n They're not, you have to, to make the thing work,\n\n55:11.440 --> 55:14.240\n you have to throw in lots and lots of extra parameters\n\n55:14.240 --> 55:17.480\n at various points, and a lot of this has to do\n\n55:17.480 --> 55:21.960\n with the so called Higgs mechanism and the Higgs field,\n\n55:21.960 --> 55:25.960\n that if you look at the theory, it's everything is,\n\n55:25.960 --> 55:28.940\n if you forget about the Higgs field and what it needs to do,\n\n55:28.940 --> 55:33.520\n the rest of the theory is very, very constrained\n\n55:33.520 --> 55:35.320\n and has very, very few free parameters,\n\n55:35.320 --> 55:36.400\n really a very small number.\n\n55:36.400 --> 55:38.060\n There's very small number of parameters\n\n55:38.060 --> 55:40.900\n and a few integers which tell you what the theory is.\n\n55:40.900 --> 55:42.960\n To make this work as a theory of the real world,\n\n55:42.960 --> 55:45.480\n you need a Higgs field and you need to,\n\n55:45.480 --> 55:48.080\n it needs to do something.\n\n55:48.080 --> 55:50.840\n And once you introduce that Higgs field,\n\n55:50.840 --> 55:54.440\n all sorts of parameters make an appearance.\n\n55:54.440 --> 55:58.760\n So now we've got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters\n\n55:58.760 --> 56:00.880\n that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are\n\n56:00.880 --> 56:02.160\n and what's gonna happen.\n\n56:02.160 --> 56:05.500\n So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing\n\n56:05.500 --> 56:09.000\n with a couple of parameters to this thing,\n\n56:09.000 --> 56:11.120\n which the minute you put it in,\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:13.200\n you had to add all this extra,\n\n56:13.200 --> 56:15.320\n all these extra parameters to make things work.\n\n56:15.320 --> 56:19.120\n And so that, it may be one argument as well,\n\n56:19.120 --> 56:20.480\n that's just the way the world is,\n\n56:20.480 --> 56:24.160\n and the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing\n\n56:24.160 --> 56:27.320\n is just your problem, or maybe we live in a multiverse\n\n56:27.320 --> 56:30.080\n and those numbers are just different in every universe.\n\n56:30.080 --> 56:33.620\n But another reasonable conjecture is just that,\n\n56:33.620 --> 56:36.020\n well, this is just telling us that there's something\n\n56:36.020 --> 56:40.200\n we don't understand about what's going on in a deeper way,\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:41.680\n which would explain those numbers.\n\n56:41.680 --> 56:44.240\n And there's some kind of deeper idea\n\n56:44.240 --> 56:47.240\n about where the Higgs field comes from and what's going on,\n\n56:47.240 --> 56:49.040\n which we haven't figured out yet.\n\n56:49.040 --> 56:52.820\n And that's what we should look for.\n\n56:52.820 --> 56:55.960\n But to stick on string theory a little bit longer,\n\n56:55.960 --> 56:57.520\n could you play devil's advocate\n\n56:58.580 --> 57:01.880\n and try to argue for string theory,\n\n57:01.880 --> 57:06.880\n why it is something that deserved the effort that it got,\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:10.400\n and still, like if you think of it as a flame,\n\n57:10.400 --> 57:14.160\n still should be a little flame that keeps burning?\n\n57:14.160 --> 57:17.600\n Well, I think the, I mean, the most positive argument\n\n57:17.600 --> 57:22.120\n for it is all sorts of new ideas about mathematics\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:24.800\n and about parts of physics really emerge from it.\n\n57:24.800 --> 57:28.420\n That was very a fruitful source of ideas.\n\n57:28.420 --> 57:30.720\n And I think this is actually one argument you'll definitely,\n\n57:30.720 --> 57:31.600\n which I kind of agree with,\n\n57:31.600 --> 57:34.280\n I'll hear from Whitten and from other string theorists,\n\n57:34.280 --> 57:38.960\n say that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea\n\n57:38.960 --> 57:41.320\n and it's led to so many other different things\n\n57:41.320 --> 57:43.680\n coming out of it that there must be something\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:45.160\n right about this.\n\n57:45.160 --> 57:48.880\n And that's, okay, anyway, I think that's probably\n\n57:48.880 --> 57:52.760\n the strongest thing that they've got.\n\n57:52.760 --> 57:55.800\n But you don't think there's aspects to it\n\n57:55.800 --> 58:00.440\n that could be neighboring to a theory\n\n58:00.440 --> 58:03.160\n that does unify everything, to a theory of everything.\n\n58:03.160 --> 58:05.720\n Like it could, it may not be exactly,\n\n58:08.080 --> 58:11.240\n exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer\n\n58:11.240 --> 58:14.360\n might get us closer to the theory of everything.\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:15.400\n Well, the problem with it now really\n\n58:15.400 --> 58:17.280\n is that you really don't know what it is now.\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:19.880\n You've never, nobody has ever kind of come up\n\n58:19.880 --> 58:23.360\n with this nonperturbative theory.\n\n58:23.360 --> 58:27.400\n So it's become more and more frustrating\n\n58:27.400 --> 58:30.320\n and an odd activity to try to argue with a string theorist\n\n58:30.320 --> 58:34.080\n about string theory because it's become\n\n58:34.080 --> 58:37.200\n less and less well defined what it is.\n\n58:37.200 --> 58:40.080\n And it's become actually more and more kind of a,\n\n58:40.080 --> 58:42.280\n whether you have this weird phenomenon\n\n58:42.280 --> 58:44.780\n of people calling themselves string theorists\n\n58:44.780 --> 58:47.480\n when they've never actually worked on any theory\n\n58:47.480 --> 58:49.520\n where there are any strings anywhere.\n\n58:49.520 --> 58:52.560\n So what has actually happened kind of sociologically\n\n58:52.560 --> 58:54.760\n is that you started out with this\n\n58:54.760 --> 58:56.480\n fairly well defined proposal.\n\n58:56.480 --> 58:59.120\n And then I would argue because that didn't work,\n\n58:59.120 --> 59:01.720\n people branched out in all sorts of directions\n\n59:01.720 --> 59:02.800\n doing all sorts of things.\n\n59:02.800 --> 59:05.520\n It became farther and farther removed from that.\n\n59:05.520 --> 59:07.880\n And for sociological reasons,\n\n59:07.880 --> 59:12.400\n the ones who kind of started out or now\n\n59:12.400 --> 59:15.360\n or were trained by the people who worked on that\n\n59:15.360 --> 59:18.880\n have now become this string theorists.\n\n59:18.880 --> 59:23.640\n And, but it's becoming almost more\n\n59:23.640 --> 59:25.640\n kind of a tribal denominator than a,\n\n59:26.640 --> 59:28.120\n I think so it's very hard to know\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:29.040\n what you're arguing about\n\n59:29.040 --> 59:30.680\n when you're arguing about string theory these days.\n\n59:30.680 --> 59:32.120\n Well, to push back on that a little bit,\n\n59:32.120 --> 59:34.560\n I mean, string theory is just a term, right?\n\n59:34.560 --> 59:37.040\n It doesn't, like you could,\n\n59:37.040 --> 59:38.920\n like this is the way language evolves\n\n59:39.780 --> 59:41.360\n is it could start to represent something\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:43.440\n more than just the theory that involves strings.\n\n59:43.440 --> 59:48.440\n It could represent the effort to unify the laws of physics.\n\n59:49.160 --> 59:50.000\n Right?\n\n59:50.000 --> 59:54.680\n At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?\n\n59:54.680 --> 59:56.120\n Or something like that.\n\n59:56.120 --> 59:59.320\n I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside.\n\n59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.840\n So for example, neural networks\n\n1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:02.680\n in the space of machine learning,\n\n1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:05.480\n there was a time when they were extremely popular.\n\n1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:07.160\n They became much, much less popular\n\n1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:09.000\n to a point where if you mentioned neural networks,\n\n1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.440\n you're getting no funding\n\n1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:13.300\n and you're not going to be respected at conferences.\n\n1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:14.440\n And then once again,\n\n1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:18.480\n neural networks became all the rage\n\n1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:20.720\n about 10, 15 years ago.\n\n1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:22.040\n And as it goes up and down\n\n1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:23.640\n and a lot of people would argue\n\n1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:26.700\n that using terminology like machine learning\n\n1:00:26.700 --> 1:00:31.700\n and deep learning is often misused over general,\n\n1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:35.200\n everything that works is deep learning,\n\n1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:38.280\n everything that doesn't, isn't something like that.\n\n1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:40.080\n That's just the way,\n\n1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:42.960\n again, we're back to sociological things,\n\n1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:45.320\n but I guess what I'm trying to get at is\n\n1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:48.640\n if we leave the sociological mess aside,\n\n1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:53.140\n do we throw out the baby with the bathwater?\n\n1:00:53.140 --> 1:00:57.160\n Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas\n\n1:00:57.160 --> 1:00:59.220\n from the Ed Wittons of the world,\n\n1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:04.220\n is there some core truths there that we should stick by\n\n1:01:04.300 --> 1:01:08.260\n in the full beautiful mess of a space\n\n1:01:08.260 --> 1:01:09.640\n that we call string theory,\n\n1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.440\n that people call string theory?\n\n1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:14.360\n You're right, it is kind of a common problem\n\n1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:19.360\n that how what you call some field changes and evolves\n\n1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.760\n and in interesting ways as the field changes.\n\n1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:27.760\n But I mean, I guess what I would argue\n\n1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:30.480\n is the initial understanding of string theory\n\n1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:31.640\n that was quite specific,\n\n1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.200\n we're talking about a specific idea,\n\n1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:34.920\n 10 dimensional super strings\n\n1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:36.880\n compactified to six dimensions.\n\n1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:41.280\n That to my mind, the really bad thing has happened\n\n1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.840\n to the subject is that it's hard to get people to admit,\n\n1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:48.160\n at least publicly, that that was a failure,\n\n1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:49.800\n that this really didn't work.\n\n1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:53.280\n And so de facto, what people do is people stop doing that\n\n1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:55.440\n and they start doing more interesting things,\n\n1:01:55.440 --> 1:02:00.440\n but they keep talking to the public about string theory\n\n1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.280\n and referring back to that idea\n\n1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.360\n and using that as kind of the starting point\n\n1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:11.760\n and as kind of the place where the whole tribe starts\n\n1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:13.320\n and everything else comes from.\n\n1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:17.960\n So the problem with this is that having as your initial name\n\n1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:20.480\n and what everything points back to,\n\n1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:25.480\n something which really didn't work out,\n\n1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:28.280\n it kind of makes everybody, it makes everything,\n\n1:02:28.280 --> 1:02:31.040\n you've created this potentially very, very interesting field\n\n1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:32.080\n with interesting things happening,\n\n1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:37.040\n but people in graduate school take courses\n\n1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:38.840\n on string theory and everything kind of,\n\n1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.160\n and this is what you tell the public\n\n1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:41.680\n in which you're continually pointing back.\n\n1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:43.520\n So you're continually pointing back to this idea\n\n1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:48.520\n which never worked out as your guiding inspiration.\n\n1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:51.600\n And it really kind of deforms your whole way\n\n1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:54.120\n of your hopes of making progress.\n\n1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.640\n And that's, to me, I think the kind of worst thing\n\n1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:59.200\n that's happened in this field.\n\n1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:02.560\n Okay, sure, so there's a lack of transparency, sort of authenticity\n\n1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.120\n about communicating the things that failed in the past.\n\n1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:10.920\n And so you don't have a clear picture of like firm ground\n\n1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.080\n that you're standing on.\n\n1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:13.840\n But again, those are sociological things.\n\n1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:18.720\n And there's a bunch of questions I want to ask you.\n\n1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:26.720\n So one, what's your intuition about why the original idea failed?\n\n1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:32.480\n So what can you say about why you're pretty sure it has failed?\n\n1:03:32.480 --> 1:03:35.400\n I mean, the initial idea was, as I try to explain it,\n\n1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:39.000\n it was quite seductive in that you could see why Whitten\n\n1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.440\n and others got excited by it.\n\n1:03:40.440 --> 1:03:45.000\n It was, you know, at the time it looked like there were only\n\n1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.600\n a few of these possible clobby owls that would work.\n\n1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:50.000\n And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand\n\n1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:53.160\n this very specific model and these very specific\n\n1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:55.760\n six dimensional spaces, and we're going to get everything.\n\n1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:59.240\n And so it was a very seductive idea, but it just, you know,\n\n1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:03.120\n as people learned, worked more and more about it,\n\n1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:07.280\n it just didn't, they just kind of realized that there are just\n\n1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:09.240\n more and more things you can do with these six dimensions\n\n1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:12.720\n and you can't, and this is just not going to work.\n\n1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:21.240\n Meaning like, it's, I mean, what was the failure mode here?\n\n1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:24.200\n Is it, you could just have an infinite number of possibilities\n\n1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:27.160\n that you could do so you can come up with any theory you want,\n\n1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:30.720\n you can fit quantum mechanics, you can explain gravity,\n\n1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.880\n you can explain anything you want with it.\n\n1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:34.280\n Is that the basic failure mode?\n\n1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:37.120\n Yeah, so it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea\n\n1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:39.920\n ended up being kind of being essentially empty,\n\n1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.240\n that it just doesn't, ends up not telling you anything\n\n1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.280\n because it's consistent with just about anything.\n\n1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:50.760\n And so, I mean, there's a complex, if you try and talk\n\n1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:52.280\n with string theorists about this now, I mean,\n\n1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:54.720\n there's an argument, there's a long argument over this\n\n1:04:54.720 --> 1:04:58.960\n about whether, oh no, no, no, maybe there still are\n\n1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.680\n constraints coming out of this idea or not.\n\n1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:06.160\n Or maybe we live in a multiverse and everything is true\n\n1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:10.200\n anyway, so you can, there are various ways you can kind of,\n\n1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.520\n that string theorists have kind of react to this kind of\n\n1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:15.520\n argument that I'm making, but I try to hold onto it.\n\n1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.880\n What about experimental validation?\n\n1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:23.880\n Is that a fair standard to hold before a theory\n\n1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:27.360\n of everything that's trying to unify\n\n1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:28.960\n quantum mechanics and gravity?\n\n1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.360\n Yeah, I mean, ultimately, to be really convinced\n\n1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.680\n that some new idea about unification really works,\n\n1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:39.720\n you need some kind of, you need to look at the real world\n\n1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:44.200\n and see that this is telling you something true about it.\n\n1:05:44.200 --> 1:05:49.200\n I mean, either telling you that if you do some experiment\n\n1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:52.440\n and go out and do it, you'll get some unexpected result\n\n1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:57.240\n and that's the kind of gold standard, or it may be just that\n\n1:05:57.240 --> 1:05:58.840\n like all those numbers that are,\n\n1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:00.060\n we don't know how to explain,\n\n1:06:00.060 --> 1:06:02.200\n it will show you how to calculate them.\n\n1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:05.260\n I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation,\n\n1:06:05.260 --> 1:06:08.640\n but that's certainly ideally what you're looking for.\n\n1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:11.240\n How tough is this, do you think, for a theory of everything,\n\n1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:13.880\n not just string theory, for something that unifies\n\n1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:14.960\n gravity and quantum mechanics,\n\n1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:17.520\n so the very big and the very small?\n\n1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.200\n Is this, let me ask you one way,\n\n1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:25.200\n is it a physics problem, a math problem,\n\n1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:27.920\n or an engineering problem?\n\n1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:30.420\n My guess is it's a combination of a physics\n\n1:06:30.420 --> 1:06:32.720\n and a math problem that you really need.\n\n1:06:33.820 --> 1:06:36.520\n It's not really engineering, it's not like there's some kind\n\n1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:39.400\n of well defined thing you can write down\n\n1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:41.540\n and we just don't have enough computer power\n\n1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:43.240\n to do the calculation.\n\n1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:46.320\n That's not the kind of problem it is at all.\n\n1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:49.400\n But the question is, what mathematical tools you need\n\n1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:53.440\n to properly formulate the problem is unclear.\n\n1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:55.960\n So one reasonable conjecture is the way,\n\n1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:58.760\n the reason that we haven't had any success yet\n\n1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:01.600\n is just that we're missing,\n\n1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:04.240\n either we're missing certain physical ideas\n\n1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:06.260\n or we're missing certain mathematical tools,\n\n1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:08.440\n which there are some combination of them,\n\n1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:12.740\n which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem\n\n1:07:12.740 --> 1:07:15.760\n and see that it has a solution\n\n1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:17.280\n that looks like the real world.\n\n1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:19.400\n But those you need, I guess you don't,\n\n1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:24.400\n but there's a sense that you need both gravity,\n\n1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:27.360\n like all the laws of physics to be operating\n\n1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:28.440\n on the same level.\n\n1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.580\n So it feels like you need an object like a black hole\n\n1:07:31.580 --> 1:07:36.580\n or something like that in order to make predictions about.\n\n1:07:38.100 --> 1:07:40.360\n Otherwise, you're always making predictions\n\n1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:45.280\n about this joint phenomena or can you do that\n\n1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:46.960\n as long as the theory is consistent\n\n1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.840\n and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?\n\n1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:50.600\n Well, your theory should, I mean,\n\n1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:52.160\n if your theory is gonna include gravity,\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.520\n our current understanding of gravity\n\n1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:54.720\n is that you should have,\n\n1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:57.840\n there should be black hole states in it.\n\n1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:00.040\n You should be able to describe black holes in this theory.\n\n1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:04.320\n And just one aspect that people have concentrated a lot on\n\n1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:06.640\n is just this kind of questions about\n\n1:08:06.640 --> 1:08:09.880\n if your theory includes black holes like it's supposed to\n\n1:08:09.880 --> 1:08:11.840\n and it includes quantum mechanics,\n\n1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:13.880\n then there's certain kinds of paradoxes which come up.\n\n1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:16.120\n And so that's been a huge focus of kind of\n\n1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:19.360\n quantum gravity work has been just those paradoxes.\n\n1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.240\n So stepping outside of string theory,\n\n1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:26.520\n can you just say first at a high level,\n\n1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:28.560\n what is the theory of everything?\n\n1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:31.280\n What is the theory of everything seek to accomplish?\n\n1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:34.760\n Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist\n\n1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:38.080\n point of view in the sense that, so it's not a theory.\n\n1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:42.320\n This is not gonna explain to you anything.\n\n1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:44.520\n It doesn't really, this kind of theory,\n\n1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:46.260\n this kind of theory of everything we're talking about\n\n1:08:46.260 --> 1:08:48.320\n doesn't say anything interesting,\n\n1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:50.240\n particularly about like macroscopic objects,\n\n1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:52.320\n about what the weather is gonna be tomorrow,\n\n1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:54.800\n or things are happening at this scale.\n\n1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.240\n But just what we've discovered is that\n\n1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:01.080\n as you look at the universe that kind of,\n\n1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.640\n if you kind of start, you can start breaking it apart\n\n1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:08.440\n into, and you end up with some fairly simple pieces,\n\n1:09:08.440 --> 1:09:11.160\n quanta, if you like, and which are doing,\n\n1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:14.480\n which are interacting in some fairly simple way.\n\n1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:18.880\n And it's, so what we mean by theory of everything is\n\n1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:24.160\n a theory that describes all the object,\n\n1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.840\n all the correct objects you need to describe\n\n1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:29.080\n what's happening in the world and describes how\n\n1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:30.160\n they're interacting with each other\n\n1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:31.880\n at our most fundamental level.\n\n1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:36.800\n How you get from that theory to describing some macroscopic,\n\n1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:38.840\n incredibly complicated thing is,\n\n1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:41.160\n there that becomes, again, more of an engineering problem\n\n1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:42.640\n and you may need machine learning,\n\n1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.740\n or you may, you know, a lot of very different things\n\n1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:45.580\n to do it, but.\n\n1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:48.760\n Well, I don't even think it's just engineering.\n\n1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:50.400\n It's also science.\n\n1:09:50.400 --> 1:09:55.200\n One thing that I find kind of interesting\n\n1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:00.200\n talking to physicists is a little bit, there's a,\n\n1:10:05.300 --> 1:10:07.220\n a little bit of hubris.\n\n1:10:07.220 --> 1:10:09.740\n Some of the most brilliant people I know are physicists,\n\n1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:12.340\n both philosophy and just in terms of mathematics,\n\n1:10:12.340 --> 1:10:14.300\n in terms of understanding the world.\n\n1:10:14.300 --> 1:10:18.060\n But there's a kind of either hubris or what would I call it?\n\n1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:22.740\n Like a confidence that if we have a theory of everything,\n\n1:10:22.740 --> 1:10:24.500\n we will understand everything.\n\n1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:26.740\n Like this is the deepest thing to understand.\n\n1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:29.820\n And I would say, and like the rest is details, right?\n\n1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:31.600\n That's the old Rutherford thing.\n\n1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:37.940\n But to me, there's like, this is like a cake or something.\n\n1:10:37.940 --> 1:10:39.140\n There's layers to this thing\n\n1:10:39.140 --> 1:10:42.020\n and each one has a theory of everything.\n\n1:10:42.020 --> 1:10:46.580\n Like at every level from biology,\n\n1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:50.860\n like how life originates, that itself,\n\n1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:52.700\n like complex systems.\n\n1:10:52.700 --> 1:10:56.860\n Like that in itself is like this gigantic thing\n\n1:10:56.860 --> 1:10:58.860\n that requires a theory of everything.\n\n1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:01.680\n And then there's the, in the space of humans,\n\n1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:04.700\n psychology, like intelligence, collective intelligence,\n\n1:11:04.700 --> 1:11:07.180\n the way it emerges among species,\n\n1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:09.260\n that feels like a complex system\n\n1:11:09.260 --> 1:11:11.580\n that requires its own theory of everything.\n\n1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:15.460\n On top of that is things like in the computing space,\n\n1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:16.820\n artificial intelligence systems,\n\n1:11:16.820 --> 1:11:19.460\n like that feels like it needs a theory of everything.\n\n1:11:19.460 --> 1:11:24.460\n And it's almost like once we solve,\n\n1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:26.660\n once we come up with a theory of everything\n\n1:11:26.660 --> 1:11:28.500\n that explains the basic laws of physics\n\n1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:30.320\n that gave us the universe,\n\n1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:32.620\n even stuff that's super complex,\n\n1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:37.120\n like how the universe might be able to originate,\n\n1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:39.460\n even explaining something that you're not a big fan of,\n\n1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:40.940\n like multiverses or stuff\n\n1:11:40.940 --> 1:11:42.900\n that we don't have any evidence of yet.\n\n1:11:42.900 --> 1:11:47.580\n Still, we won't be able to have a strong explanation\n\n1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:52.580\n of why food tastes delicious.\n\n1:11:52.700 --> 1:11:53.660\n Yeah, I know.\n\n1:11:53.660 --> 1:11:55.620\n No, anyway, yeah, I agree completely.\n\n1:11:55.620 --> 1:11:58.700\n I mean, there is something kind of completely wrong\n\n1:11:58.700 --> 1:12:00.860\n with this terminology of theory of everything.\n\n1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:04.100\n It's not, it's really in some sense a very bad term,\n\n1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:06.420\n very hubristic and bad terminology,\n\n1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:09.060\n because it's not, this is explaining,\n\n1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:13.160\n this is a purely kind of reductionist point of view\n\n1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:15.260\n that you're trying to understand\n\n1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:17.900\n a certain very specific kind of things,\n\n1:12:17.900 --> 1:12:22.900\n which in principle, other things emerge from,\n\n1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:27.660\n but to actually understand how anything emerges from this\n\n1:12:27.660 --> 1:12:30.780\n is, it can't be understood in terms of\n\n1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:35.740\n this underlying fundamental theory is gonna be hopeless\n\n1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:38.320\n in terms of kind of telling you what about this,\n\n1:12:39.620 --> 1:12:40.980\n this various emergent behavior.\n\n1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:43.060\n And as you go to different levels of explanation,\n\n1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:44.660\n you're gonna need to develop new,\n\n1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.100\n different, completely different ideas,\n\n1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:47.380\n completely different ways of thinking.\n\n1:12:47.380 --> 1:12:52.380\n And I guess there's a famous kind of Phil Anderson's slogan\n\n1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:54.380\n is that, you know, more is different.\n\n1:12:54.380 --> 1:12:59.300\n And so it's just, even once you understand how,\n\n1:12:59.300 --> 1:13:00.580\n what a couple of things,\n\n1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:01.940\n if you have a collection of stuff\n\n1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:03.220\n and you understand perfectly well\n\n1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:07.320\n how each thing is interacting with the others,\n\n1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:08.600\n what the whole thing is gonna do\n\n1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:10.160\n is just a completely different problem.\n\n1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:12.260\n It's just not, and you need completely different ways\n\n1:13:12.260 --> 1:13:13.520\n of thinking about it.\n\n1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:15.100\n What do you think about this?\n\n1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.420\n I got to ask you at a few different attempts\n\n1:13:17.420 --> 1:13:20.060\n that a theory of everything, especially recently.\n\n1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:23.240\n So I've been for many years,\n\n1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:25.620\n a big fan of cellular automata of complex systems.\n\n1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:28.140\n And obviously because of that,\n\n1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:31.500\n a fan of Stephen Wolfram's work in that space,\n\n1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:35.180\n but he's recently been talking about a theory of everything\n\n1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:38.100\n through his physics project, essentially.\n\n1:13:38.100 --> 1:13:40.340\n What do you think about this kind of discreet\n\n1:13:40.340 --> 1:13:45.140\n theory of everything like from simple rules\n\n1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:47.660\n and simple objects on the hypergraphs\n\n1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:51.500\n emerges all of our reality where time and space are emergent.\n\n1:13:51.500 --> 1:13:53.980\n Basically everything we see around us is emergent.\n\n1:13:53.980 --> 1:13:55.420\n Yeah, I have to say, unfortunately,\n\n1:13:55.420 --> 1:13:58.440\n I've kind of pretty much zero sympathy for that.\n\n1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:01.660\n I mean, I don't, I spent a little time looking at it\n\n1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:04.940\n and I just don't see, it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere.\n\n1:14:04.940 --> 1:14:08.780\n And it really is just really, really doesn't agree at all\n\n1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:10.900\n with what I'm seeing,\n\n1:14:10.900 --> 1:14:13.180\n this kind of unification of math and physics\n\n1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:15.440\n that I'm kind of talking about around certain kinds\n\n1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:17.860\n of very deep ideas about geometry and stuff.\n\n1:14:17.860 --> 1:14:22.400\n This, if you want to believe that your things\n\n1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:25.140\n are really coming out of cellular automata\n\n1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:26.780\n at the most fundamental level,\n\n1:14:26.780 --> 1:14:30.480\n you have to believe that everything that I've seen\n\n1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:34.340\n my whole career and as beautiful, powerful ideas,\n\n1:14:34.340 --> 1:14:35.740\n that that's all just kind of a mirage,\n\n1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:38.200\n which just kind of randomly is emerging\n\n1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:41.480\n from these more basic, very, very simple minded things.\n\n1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:44.980\n And you have to give me some serious evidence for that\n\n1:14:44.980 --> 1:14:46.240\n and I'm seeing nothing.\n\n1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.420\n So Mirage, you don't think there could be a consistency\n\n1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:54.500\n where things like quantum mechanics could emerge\n\n1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.640\n from much, much, much smaller, discreet,\n\n1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:00.100\n like computational type systems.\n\n1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:02.540\n I think from the point of view of certain mathematical\n\n1:15:02.540 --> 1:15:06.400\n point of view, quantum mechanics is already mathematically\n\n1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:07.420\n as simple as it gets.\n\n1:15:07.420 --> 1:15:12.420\n It really is a story about really the fundamental objects\n\n1:15:13.620 --> 1:15:16.420\n that you work within when you write down a quantum theory\n\n1:15:16.420 --> 1:15:18.500\n are in some form point of view,\n\n1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:20.180\n precisely the fundamental objects\n\n1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:22.900\n at these deepest levels of mathematics\n\n1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:25.060\n that you're working with, they're exactly the same.\n\n1:15:25.060 --> 1:15:28.460\n So, and cellular automata are something completely different\n\n1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:30.000\n which don't fit into these structures.\n\n1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.540\n And so I just don't see why, anyway,\n\n1:15:32.540 --> 1:15:37.340\n I don't see it as a promising thing to do.\n\n1:15:37.340 --> 1:15:38.580\n And then just looking at it and saying,\n\n1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:39.480\n does this go anywhere?\n\n1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:42.440\n Does this solve any problem that I've ever,\n\n1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:45.300\n that I didn't, does this solve any problem of any kind?\n\n1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:46.740\n I just don't see it.\n\n1:15:46.740 --> 1:15:50.580\n Yeah, to me, cellular automata and these hypergraphs,\n\n1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:55.280\n I'm not sure solving a problem is even the standard\n\n1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:57.700\n to apply here at this moment.\n\n1:15:57.700 --> 1:16:00.580\n To me, the fascinating thing is that the question it asks\n\n1:16:00.580 --> 1:16:02.020\n have no good answers.\n\n1:16:02.020 --> 1:16:04.580\n So there's not good math explaining,\n\n1:16:04.580 --> 1:16:06.020\n forget the physics of it,\n\n1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:09.180\n math explaining the behavior of complex systems.\n\n1:16:09.180 --> 1:16:12.340\n And that to me is both exciting and paralyzing.\n\n1:16:12.340 --> 1:16:15.380\n Like we're at the very early days of understanding\n\n1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:19.980\n how complicated and fascinating things emerge\n\n1:16:19.980 --> 1:16:21.300\n from simple rules.\n\n1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:22.740\n Yeah, and I agree.\n\n1:16:22.740 --> 1:16:25.460\n I think that is a truly great problem.\n\n1:16:25.460 --> 1:16:28.120\n And depending where it goes, it may be,\n\n1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:33.600\n it may start to develop some kind of connections\n\n1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:36.740\n to the things that I've kind of found more fruitful\n\n1:16:36.740 --> 1:16:38.740\n and hard to know.\n\n1:16:38.740 --> 1:16:41.380\n It just, I think a lot of that area,\n\n1:16:41.380 --> 1:16:45.740\n I kind of strongly feel I best not say too much about it\n\n1:16:45.740 --> 1:16:48.220\n because I just, I don't know too much about it.\n\n1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:51.580\n And again, we're back to this original problem\n\n1:16:51.580 --> 1:16:54.340\n that your time in life is limited.\n\n1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:55.780\n You have to figure out what you're gonna spend\n\n1:16:55.780 --> 1:16:56.820\n your time thinking about.\n\n1:16:56.820 --> 1:16:59.060\n And that's something I've just never seen enough\n\n1:16:59.060 --> 1:17:01.460\n to convince me to spend more time thinking about.\n\n1:17:01.460 --> 1:17:03.940\n Well, also timing, it's not just that our time is limited,\n\n1:17:03.940 --> 1:17:07.180\n but the timing of the kind of things you think about.\n\n1:17:07.180 --> 1:17:09.740\n There's some aspect to cellular automata,\n\n1:17:09.740 --> 1:17:12.820\n these kinds of objects that it feels like\n\n1:17:12.820 --> 1:17:17.820\n we're very many years away from having big breakthroughs on.\n\n1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:20.420\n And so it's like, you have to pick the problems\n\n1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:21.780\n that are solvable today.\n\n1:17:21.780 --> 1:17:26.400\n In fact, my intuition, again, perhaps biased,\n\n1:17:26.400 --> 1:17:30.180\n is it feels like the kind of systems that,\n\n1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:32.840\n complex systems that cellular automata are,\n\n1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:35.100\n would not be solved by human brains.\n\n1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:40.300\n It feels like something post human\n\n1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:41.840\n that will solve that problem.\n\n1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:45.020\n Or like significantly enhanced humans,\n\n1:17:45.020 --> 1:17:47.700\n meaning like using computational tools,\n\n1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:51.740\n very powerful computational tools to crack\n\n1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:53.120\n these problems open.\n\n1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:58.140\n That's if our approach to science,\n\n1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:00.420\n our ability to understand science, our ability\n\n1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:02.500\n to understand physics will become more and more\n\n1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:04.660\n computational, or there'll be a whole field\n\n1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:06.300\n that's computational in nature,\n\n1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:07.740\n which currently is not the case.\n\n1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:12.460\n Currently, computation is the thing that sort of assists us\n\n1:18:12.460 --> 1:18:15.640\n in understanding science the way we've been doing it\n\n1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:17.980\n all along, but if there's a whole new,\n\n1:18:17.980 --> 1:18:20.540\n I mean, we're from a new kind of science, right?\n\n1:18:20.540 --> 1:18:23.360\n It's a little bit dramatic, but you know,\n\n1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:28.360\n if computers could do science on their own,\n\n1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:33.680\n computational systems, perhaps that's the way\n\n1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:35.600\n they would do the science.\n\n1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:37.760\n They would try to understand the cellular automata,\n\n1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:39.980\n and that feels like we're decades away.\n\n1:18:39.980 --> 1:18:43.980\n So perhaps it'll crack open some interesting facets\n\n1:18:43.980 --> 1:18:46.320\n of this physics problem, but it's very far away.\n\n1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:48.680\n So timing is everything.\n\n1:18:48.680 --> 1:18:51.040\n That's perfectly possible, yeah.\n\n1:18:51.040 --> 1:18:53.640\n Well, let me ask you then, in the space of geometry,\n\n1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:57.280\n I don't know how well you know Eric Weinstein.\n\n1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:58.320\n Oh, quite well, yeah.\n\n1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.600\n What are your thoughts about his geometric community\n\n1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:05.760\n and the space of ideas that he's playing with\n\n1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:09.800\n in his proposal for theory of everything?\n\n1:19:09.800 --> 1:19:14.140\n Well, I think that he has, he fundamentally has,\n\n1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:17.800\n I think, the same problems that everybody has had\n\n1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:20.960\n trying to do this, and there are really versions\n\n1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.960\n of the same problem that you try to get unity\n\n1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:28.840\n by putting everything into some bigger structure.\n\n1:19:28.840 --> 1:19:33.460\n So he has some other ones that are not so conventional\n\n1:19:33.460 --> 1:19:35.040\n that he's trying to work with,\n\n1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:39.620\n but he has the same problem that even if he can,\n\n1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:43.640\n if he can get a lot farther in terms of having\n\n1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:45.860\n a really well defined, well understood,\n\n1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:50.300\n clear picture of these things he's working with,\n\n1:19:50.300 --> 1:19:53.240\n they're really kind of large geometrical structures\n\n1:19:53.240 --> 1:19:55.160\n of many dimensions of many kinds,\n\n1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:57.400\n and I just don't see any way,\n\n1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:59.520\n he's gonna have the same problem the string theorists have,\n\n1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:02.680\n how do you get back down to the structures\n\n1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:06.860\n of the standard model, and how do you, yeah.\n\n1:20:06.860 --> 1:20:10.760\n So I just, anyway, it's the same,\n\n1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:13.320\n and there's another interesting example\n\n1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:16.040\n of a similar kind of thing is Garrett Leasy's\n\n1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:17.400\n theory of everything.\n\n1:20:17.400 --> 1:20:20.040\n Again, there, it's a little bit more specific\n\n1:20:20.040 --> 1:20:22.520\n than Eric's, he's working with this E8,\n\n1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:25.980\n but it, again, I think all these things found\n\n1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:27.880\n are at the same point, that you don't,\n\n1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:30.760\n you know, you create this unity,\n\n1:20:30.760 --> 1:20:34.920\n but then you have no, you don't actually have a good idea\n\n1:20:34.920 --> 1:20:37.880\n how you're gonna get back to the actual,\n\n1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:42.680\n to the objects we've seen, how are you gonna,\n\n1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:43.920\n you create these big symmetries,\n\n1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:45.340\n how are you gonna break them?\n\n1:20:45.340 --> 1:20:47.480\n And, because we don't see those symmetries\n\n1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:49.720\n in the real world, and so ultimately,\n\n1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.840\n there would need to be a simple process\n\n1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:56.280\n for collapsing it to four dimensions.\n\n1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.480\n You'd have to explain, well, yeah,\n\n1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:01.000\n I forget in his case, but it's not just four dimensions,\n\n1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.400\n it's also these structures you see in the standard model,\n\n1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:07.600\n there's, you know, there's certain very small\n\n1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.160\n dimensional groups of symmetries,\n\n1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:13.800\n so called U1, SU2, and SU3, and the problem with,\n\n1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:15.240\n and this has been a problem since the beginning,\n\n1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:18.880\n almost immediately after 1973, about a year later,\n\n1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:20.600\n two years later, people started talking about\n\n1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:24.280\n grand unified theories, so you take the U1,\n\n1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:27.120\n the SU2, and the SU3, and you put them together\n\n1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:31.520\n into this bigger structure called SU5 or SO10,\n\n1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:33.560\n but then you're stuck with this problem that,\n\n1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:36.440\n wait a minute, now how, why does the world not look,\n\n1:21:36.440 --> 1:21:40.960\n why do I not see these SU5 symmetries in the world,\n\n1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:45.960\n I only see these, and so, and I think, you know,\n\n1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:49.880\n the kind of thing that Eric, and all of a sudden Garrett,\n\n1:21:49.880 --> 1:21:51.000\n and lots of people who try to do it,\n\n1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.160\n they all kind of found her in that same way,\n\n1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:57.660\n that they don't have a good answer to that.\n\n1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:01.800\n Are there lessons, ideas to be learned from theories\n\n1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:04.040\n like that, from Garrett Leacy's, from Eric's?\n\n1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:07.080\n I don't know, it depends, I have to confess,\n\n1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:11.020\n I haven't looked that closely at Eric's,\n\n1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.240\n I mean, he explained this to me personally a few times,\n\n1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.640\n and I've looked a bit at his paper, but it's,\n\n1:22:17.560 --> 1:22:19.280\n again, we're back to the problem\n\n1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:21.080\n of a limited amount of time in life.\n\n1:22:22.360 --> 1:22:24.760\n Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting effect, right?\n\n1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:28.840\n Why don't more physicists look at it?\n\n1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:35.960\n I mean, I'm in this position that somehow,\n\n1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:38.400\n you know,\n\n1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:43.400\n I've, people write me emails, for whatever reason,\n\n1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:47.460\n and I've worked in the space of AI,\n\n1:22:47.460 --> 1:22:49.180\n and so there's a lot of people,\n\n1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:52.300\n perhaps AI is even way more accessible than physics,\n\n1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:54.980\n in a certain sense, and so a lot of people write to me\n\n1:22:54.980 --> 1:22:56.720\n with different theories about what they have\n\n1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:00.000\n for how to create general intelligence,\n\n1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.380\n and it's, again, a little bit of an excuse, I say to myself,\n\n1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:05.420\n like, well, I only have a limited amount of time,\n\n1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:07.940\n so that's why I'm not investigating it,\n\n1:23:07.940 --> 1:23:11.620\n but I wonder if there's ideas out there\n\n1:23:11.620 --> 1:23:14.700\n that are still powerful, that are still fascinating,\n\n1:23:14.700 --> 1:23:19.700\n and that I'm missing because I'm dismissing them\n\n1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:24.740\n because they're outside of the sort of the usual process\n\n1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:26.780\n of academic research.\n\n1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:28.340\n Yeah, well, I mean, the same thing,\n\n1:23:28.340 --> 1:23:29.940\n and pretty much every day in my email,\n\n1:23:29.940 --> 1:23:32.980\n there's somebody who's got a theory or everything\n\n1:23:32.980 --> 1:23:35.180\n about why all of what physicists are doing,\n\n1:23:35.180 --> 1:23:38.940\n and perhaps the most disturbing thing I should say\n\n1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:41.740\n about being a critic of string theory\n\n1:23:41.740 --> 1:23:43.900\n is that when you realize who your fans are,\n\n1:23:45.700 --> 1:23:47.060\n every day I hear from somebody who says,\n\n1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:48.620\n oh, well, since you don't like string theory,\n\n1:23:48.620 --> 1:23:49.980\n you must, of course, agree with me\n\n1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:52.260\n that this is the right way to think about everything.\n\n1:23:52.260 --> 1:23:57.260\n Oh, no, oh, no, and most of these are,\n\n1:23:57.620 --> 1:24:00.800\n you quickly can see this person doesn't know very much\n\n1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:02.500\n and doesn't know what they're doing,\n\n1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:05.100\n but there's a whole continuum to,\n\n1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:08.060\n people who are quite serious physicists and mathematicians\n\n1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:10.380\n who are making a fairly serious attempt\n\n1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:14.620\n to try to do something, like Eric and Eric,\n\n1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:19.620\n and then your problem is you do try to spend more time\n\n1:24:21.380 --> 1:24:22.600\n looking at it and trying to figure out\n\n1:24:22.600 --> 1:24:23.700\n what they're really doing,\n\n1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:26.220\n but then at some point you just realize,\n\n1:24:26.220 --> 1:24:28.220\n wait a minute, for me to really, really understand\n\n1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:32.340\n exactly what's going on here would just take time\n\n1:24:32.340 --> 1:24:33.620\n I just don't have.\n\n1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.940\n Yeah, it takes a long time, which is the nice thing about AI\n\n1:24:36.940 --> 1:24:41.140\n is unlike the kind of physics we're talking about,\n\n1:24:41.140 --> 1:24:46.140\n if your idea is good, that should quite naturally lead\n\n1:24:46.660 --> 1:24:49.820\n to you being able to build a system that's intelligent.\n\n1:24:49.820 --> 1:24:52.280\n So you don't need to get approval from somebody\n\n1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:54.460\n that's saying you have a good idea here.\n\n1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:56.940\n You can just utilize that idea in an engineer system,\n\n1:24:56.940 --> 1:24:58.860\n like naturally leads to engineering.\n\n1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:01.940\n With physics here, if you have a perfect theory\n\n1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:06.060\n that explains everything, that still doesn't obviously lead\n\n1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:11.060\n one, to scientific experiments that can validate\n\n1:25:12.020 --> 1:25:15.700\n that theory, and two, to like trinkets you can build\n\n1:25:15.700 --> 1:25:18.580\n and sell at a store for $5.\n\n1:25:18.580 --> 1:25:20.220\n You can't make money off of it.\n\n1:25:21.220 --> 1:25:23.660\n So that makes it much more challenging.\n\n1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:28.580\n Well, let me also ask you about something that you found,\n\n1:25:28.580 --> 1:25:30.540\n especially recently appealing,\n\n1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:32.840\n which is Roger Penrose's Twister theory.\n\n1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:35.180\n What is it?\n\n1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:37.820\n What kind of questions might it allow us to answer?\n\n1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:39.900\n What will the answers look like?\n\n1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:41.620\n It's only in the last couple of years\n\n1:25:41.620 --> 1:25:43.380\n that I really, really kind of come to really,\n\n1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:46.060\n I think, to appreciate it and to see how to really,\n\n1:25:46.060 --> 1:25:48.500\n I believe to see how to really do something with it.\n\n1:25:48.500 --> 1:25:49.980\n And I've gotten very excited about that\n\n1:25:49.980 --> 1:25:51.220\n the last year or two.\n\n1:25:51.220 --> 1:25:54.820\n I mean, one way of saying one idea of Twister theory\n\n1:25:54.820 --> 1:25:59.080\n is that it's a different way of thinking about\n\n1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:01.660\n what space and time are and about what points\n\n1:26:01.660 --> 1:26:05.100\n in space and time are, which is very interesting\n\n1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:07.420\n that it only really works in four dimensions.\n\n1:26:07.420 --> 1:26:09.700\n So four dimensions behaves very, very specially\n\n1:26:09.700 --> 1:26:11.180\n unlike other dimensions.\n\n1:26:11.180 --> 1:26:14.500\n And in four dimensions, there is a way of thinking\n\n1:26:14.500 --> 1:26:17.580\n about space and time geometry,\n\n1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:21.280\n as well as just thinking about points in space and time.\n\n1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:25.140\n You can also think about different objects,\n\n1:26:25.140 --> 1:26:26.240\n these so called twisters.\n\n1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.860\n And then when you do that,\n\n1:26:27.860 --> 1:26:30.900\n you end up with a kind of a really interesting insight\n\n1:26:30.900 --> 1:26:35.340\n that you can formulate a theory,\n\n1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:37.100\n and you can formulate a very,\n\n1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:39.420\n take a standard theory that we formulate\n\n1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:41.660\n in terms of points of space and time,\n\n1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:44.460\n and you can reformulate in this Twister language.\n\n1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:45.820\n And in this Twister language,\n\n1:26:45.820 --> 1:26:50.460\n it's the fundamental objects actually are more kind of the,\n\n1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:54.140\n are actually spheres in some sense, kind of the light cone.\n\n1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:56.900\n So maybe one way to say it,\n\n1:26:56.900 --> 1:27:01.900\n which actually I think is really, is quite amazing.\n\n1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:05.140\n If you ask yourself, what do we know about the world?\n\n1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:07.900\n We have this idea that the world out there\n\n1:27:07.900 --> 1:27:11.340\n is all these different points and these points of time.\n\n1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:13.220\n Well, that's kind of a derived quantity.\n\n1:27:13.220 --> 1:27:16.300\n What we really know about the world is when we open our eyes,\n\n1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:17.460\n what do you see?\n\n1:27:17.460 --> 1:27:19.580\n You see a sphere.\n\n1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.100\n And that what you're looking at is you're looking at,\n\n1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:26.420\n a sphere is worth of light rays coming into your eyes.\n\n1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:29.140\n And what Penrose says is that,\n\n1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:33.820\n well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere,\n\n1:27:33.820 --> 1:27:36.620\n that sphere of all the light rays coming in.\n\n1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:39.180\n And he says, and you should formulate your,\n\n1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:40.700\n instead of thinking about points,\n\n1:27:40.700 --> 1:27:43.100\n you should think about the space of those spheres,\n\n1:27:43.100 --> 1:27:46.860\n if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom\n\n1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:50.020\n as physics as living on those spheres, living on,\n\n1:27:50.020 --> 1:27:51.940\n so you're kind of living on,\n\n1:27:51.940 --> 1:27:53.660\n your degrees of freedom are living on light rays,\n\n1:27:53.660 --> 1:27:55.180\n not on points.\n\n1:27:55.180 --> 1:28:00.180\n And it's a very different way of thinking about physics.\n\n1:28:00.660 --> 1:28:03.260\n And he and others working with him developed\n\n1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:08.260\n a beautiful mathematical formulas\n\n1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:11.540\n and a way to go back from forth between some aspects\n\n1:28:11.540 --> 1:28:14.180\n of our standard way we write these things down\n\n1:28:14.180 --> 1:28:17.380\n and work in the so called twister space.\n\n1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:20.380\n And certain things worked out very well,\n\n1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:24.940\n but they ended up, I think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s\n\n1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:27.980\n that they weren't a little bit like string theory\n\n1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:31.220\n that they, by using these ideas about twisters,\n\n1:28:31.220 --> 1:28:33.100\n they could develop them in different directions\n\n1:28:33.100 --> 1:28:34.780\n and find all sorts of other interesting things,\n\n1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:36.900\n but they were getting,\n\n1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:38.580\n they weren't finding any way of doing that\n\n1:28:38.580 --> 1:28:43.140\n that brought them back to kind of new insights into physics.\n\n1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:46.420\n And my own, I mean, what's kind of gotten me excited really\n\n1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:49.700\n is what I think I have an idea about\n\n1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:52.580\n that I think does actually work,\n\n1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:54.180\n that goes more in that direction.\n\n1:28:54.180 --> 1:28:56.780\n And I can go on about that endlessly\n\n1:28:56.780 --> 1:28:57.820\n or talk a little bit about it,\n\n1:28:57.820 --> 1:29:02.620\n but that's the, I think that's the one kind of easy\n\n1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:05.260\n to explain insight about twister theory.\n\n1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:06.860\n There are some more technical ones.\n\n1:29:06.860 --> 1:29:09.340\n I should mean, I think it's also very convincing\n\n1:29:09.340 --> 1:29:11.260\n what it tells you about spinners, for instance,\n\n1:29:11.260 --> 1:29:12.980\n but that's a more technical.\n\n1:29:12.980 --> 1:29:14.980\n Well, first let's like linger on the spheres\n\n1:29:14.980 --> 1:29:16.100\n and the light cones.\n\n1:29:17.460 --> 1:29:20.780\n You're saying twisted theory allows you to make\n\n1:29:20.780 --> 1:29:23.740\n that the fundamental object with which you're operating.\n\n1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:24.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:26.340\n How that, I mean, first of all,\n\n1:29:26.340 --> 1:29:30.820\n like philosophically that's weird and beautiful,\n\n1:29:32.260 --> 1:29:34.500\n maybe because it maps,\n\n1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:37.020\n it feels like it moves us so much closer\n\n1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:40.500\n to the way human brains perceive reality.\n\n1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:41.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:46.340\n So it's almost like our perception is like the content\n\n1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:51.340\n of our perception is the fundamental object of reality.\n\n1:29:54.580 --> 1:29:55.900\n That's very appealing.\n\n1:29:55.900 --> 1:29:57.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:57.260 --> 1:30:00.660\n Is it mathematically powerful?\n\n1:30:01.860 --> 1:30:04.740\n Is there something you can say,\n\n1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:06.540\n can you say a little bit more about what the heck\n\n1:30:06.540 --> 1:30:08.380\n that even means for,\n\n1:30:08.380 --> 1:30:11.260\n because it's much easier to think about mathematically\n\n1:30:11.260 --> 1:30:13.740\n like a point in space time.\n\n1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:16.900\n What does it mean to be operating on the light cone?\n\n1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:19.380\n It uses a kind of mathematics that's relative,\n\n1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:22.060\n that kind of goes back to the 19th century\n\n1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:23.020\n among mathematicians.\n\n1:30:23.020 --> 1:30:26.420\n It's not, anyway, it's a bit of a long story,\n\n1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:28.860\n but one problem is that you have to start,\n\n1:30:28.860 --> 1:30:31.700\n it's crucial that you think in terms of complex numbers\n\n1:30:31.700 --> 1:30:32.900\n and not just real numbers.\n\n1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:36.340\n And this, for most people, that makes it harder to,\n\n1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:37.620\n for mathematicians, that's fine.\n\n1:30:37.620 --> 1:30:38.460\n We love doing that.\n\n1:30:38.460 --> 1:30:41.380\n But for most people, that makes it harder to think about.\n\n1:30:41.380 --> 1:30:43.100\n I think perhaps the most,\n\n1:30:43.100 --> 1:30:45.540\n the way that there is something you can say\n\n1:30:45.540 --> 1:30:49.060\n very specifically about it in terms of spinners,\n\n1:30:49.060 --> 1:30:50.060\n which I don't know if you want to,\n\n1:30:50.060 --> 1:30:52.340\n I think at some point you want to talk, so maybe you can.\n\n1:30:52.340 --> 1:30:53.340\n What are spinners?\n\n1:30:53.340 --> 1:30:54.180\n Let's start with spinners,\n\n1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:55.980\n because I think that if we can introduce that,\n\n1:30:55.980 --> 1:30:57.300\n then I can say it.\n\n1:30:57.300 --> 1:31:01.020\n By the way, twister is spelled with an O\n\n1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.700\n and spinner is spelled with an O as well.\n\n1:31:03.700 --> 1:31:05.260\n Yes, okay.\n\n1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:07.660\n In case you want to Google it and look it up,\n\n1:31:07.660 --> 1:31:10.940\n there's very nice Wikipedia pages as a starting point.\n\n1:31:10.940 --> 1:31:12.380\n I don't know what is a good starting point\n\n1:31:12.380 --> 1:31:13.540\n for twister theory.\n\n1:31:13.540 --> 1:31:16.060\n Well, one thing you say about Penrose,\n\n1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:18.100\n I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer\n\n1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:19.380\n and also a very good draftsman.\n\n1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:22.020\n He's a draftsman, to the extent this is visualizable,\n\n1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:23.700\n he actually has done some very nice drawings.\n\n1:31:23.700 --> 1:31:26.460\n So, I mean, almost any kind of expository thing\n\n1:31:26.460 --> 1:31:29.820\n you can find him writing is a very good place to start.\n\n1:31:29.820 --> 1:31:32.540\n He's a remarkable person.\n\n1:31:32.540 --> 1:31:36.060\n But the, so spinners are something\n\n1:31:36.060 --> 1:31:38.380\n that independently came out of mathematics\n\n1:31:38.380 --> 1:31:40.060\n and out of physics.\n\n1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:42.620\n And to say where they came out of physics,\n\n1:31:42.620 --> 1:31:44.620\n I mean, what people realized when they started looking\n\n1:31:44.620 --> 1:31:47.580\n at elementary particles like electrons or whatever,\n\n1:31:47.580 --> 1:31:51.660\n that there seem to be some kind of doubling\n\n1:31:51.660 --> 1:31:53.140\n of the degrees of freedom going on.\n\n1:31:53.140 --> 1:31:57.060\n If you counted what was there in some sense\n\n1:31:57.060 --> 1:31:58.180\n in the way you would expect it\n\n1:31:58.180 --> 1:32:00.020\n and when you started doing quantum mechanics\n\n1:32:00.020 --> 1:32:01.780\n and started looking at elementary particles,\n\n1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:03.700\n there were seen to be two degrees of freedom,\n\n1:32:03.700 --> 1:32:04.900\n they're not one.\n\n1:32:04.900 --> 1:32:09.860\n And one way of seeing it was that if you put your electron\n\n1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:13.860\n in a strong magnetic field and asked what was the energy\n\n1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.540\n of it, instead of it having one energy,\n\n1:32:15.540 --> 1:32:17.940\n it would have two energies, there'd be two energy levels.\n\n1:32:17.940 --> 1:32:20.500\n And as you increase magnetic field,\n\n1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:22.100\n the splitting would increase.\n\n1:32:22.100 --> 1:32:24.980\n So physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute.\n\n1:32:24.980 --> 1:32:27.020\n So we thought when we were doing,\n\n1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.260\n first started doing quantum mechanics,\n\n1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:31.660\n that the way to describe particles was in terms\n\n1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:33.540\n of wave functions and these wave functions\n\n1:32:33.540 --> 1:32:35.860\n were complex to complex values.\n\n1:32:35.860 --> 1:32:38.020\n Well, if we actually look at particles,\n\n1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:38.860\n that that's not right.\n\n1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:42.060\n They're pairs of complex numbers.\n\n1:32:42.060 --> 1:32:44.100\n They're pairs of complex numbers.\n\n1:32:44.100 --> 1:32:46.900\n So one of the kind of fundamental,\n\n1:32:46.900 --> 1:32:47.820\n from the physics point of view,\n\n1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:50.220\n the fundamental question is why are all our kind\n\n1:32:50.220 --> 1:32:53.900\n of fundamental particles described\n\n1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:55.740\n by pairs of complex numbers?\n\n1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:56.740\n Just weird.\n\n1:32:56.740 --> 1:33:00.220\n And then you can ask, well, what happens\n\n1:33:00.220 --> 1:33:03.140\n if you like take an electron and rotate it?\n\n1:33:03.140 --> 1:33:08.140\n So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?\n\n1:33:08.140 --> 1:33:10.940\n Well, now, if you go back to mathematics,\n\n1:33:10.940 --> 1:33:13.860\n what had been understood in mathematics,\n\n1:33:13.860 --> 1:33:16.380\n some years earlier, not that many years earlier,\n\n1:33:16.380 --> 1:33:20.500\n was that if you ask very, very generally,\n\n1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:24.260\n think about geometry of three dimensions and ask,\n\n1:33:24.260 --> 1:33:25.820\n and if you think about things that are happening\n\n1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:28.260\n in three dimensions in the standard way,\n\n1:33:28.260 --> 1:33:30.500\n everything, the standard way of doing geometry,\n\n1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:32.540\n everything is about vectors, right?\n\n1:33:32.540 --> 1:33:35.220\n So if you've taken any mathematics classes,\n\n1:33:35.220 --> 1:33:36.700\n you probably see vectors at some point.\n\n1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:39.420\n They're just triplets of numbers tell you\n\n1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:41.620\n what a direction is or how far you're going\n\n1:33:41.620 --> 1:33:42.980\n in three dimensional space.\n\n1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:46.260\n And most of everything we teach in most standard courses\n\n1:33:46.260 --> 1:33:49.700\n in mathematics is about vectors\n\n1:33:49.700 --> 1:33:51.420\n and things you build out of vectors.\n\n1:33:51.420 --> 1:33:53.060\n So you express everything about geometry\n\n1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:55.420\n in terms of vectors or how they're changing\n\n1:33:55.420 --> 1:33:57.620\n or how you put two of them together\n\n1:33:57.620 --> 1:34:00.940\n and get planes and whatever.\n\n1:34:00.940 --> 1:34:03.660\n But what had been realized that,\n\n1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:05.820\n Rianna, is that if you ask very, very generally,\n\n1:34:05.820 --> 1:34:09.140\n what are the, if you have, what are the things\n\n1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:13.020\n that you can kind of consistently think about rotating?\n\n1:34:13.020 --> 1:34:16.340\n And so you ask a technical question,\n\n1:34:16.340 --> 1:34:18.620\n what are the representations of the rotation group?\n\n1:34:18.620 --> 1:34:22.220\n Well, you find that one answer is they're vectors\n\n1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:24.660\n and everything you build out of vectors,\n\n1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:26.420\n but then people found, but wait a minute,\n\n1:34:26.420 --> 1:34:29.220\n there's also these other things,\n\n1:34:29.220 --> 1:34:31.820\n which you can build out of vectors,\n\n1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:34.420\n but which you can consistently rotate.\n\n1:34:34.420 --> 1:34:37.020\n And they're described by pairs of complex numbers,\n\n1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:38.420\n by two complex numbers.\n\n1:34:38.420 --> 1:34:40.580\n And they're the spinners also.\n\n1:34:40.580 --> 1:34:43.020\n And to make a lot, and to make,\n\n1:34:43.020 --> 1:34:45.060\n and you can think of spinners in some sense\n\n1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:46.660\n as more fundamental than vectors\n\n1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:48.860\n because you can build vectors out of spinners.\n\n1:34:48.860 --> 1:34:51.180\n You can take two spinners and make a vector,\n\n1:34:51.180 --> 1:34:54.940\n but you can't, if you only have vectors,\n\n1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:56.620\n you can't get spinners.\n\n1:34:56.620 --> 1:34:59.220\n So they're in some sense, there's some kind of level\n\n1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:02.140\n of lower level of geometry beyond what we thought it was,\n\n1:35:02.140 --> 1:35:04.260\n which was kind of spinner geometry.\n\n1:35:04.260 --> 1:35:07.340\n And this is something which even to this day,\n\n1:35:07.340 --> 1:35:09.460\n when we teach graduate courses in geometry,\n\n1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:11.700\n we mostly don't talk about this\n\n1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:15.380\n because it's a bit hard to do correctly.\n\n1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:18.860\n If you start with your whole setup is in terms of vectors,\n\n1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:22.020\n describing things in terms of spinners\n\n1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:24.020\n is a whole different ball game.\n\n1:35:24.860 --> 1:35:28.780\n But anyway, it was just this amazing fact\n\n1:35:28.780 --> 1:35:33.020\n that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry,\n\n1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:35.500\n spinners, and what we were actually seeing,\n\n1:35:35.500 --> 1:35:37.900\n if you look at electron, are one and the same.\n\n1:35:37.900 --> 1:35:41.300\n So it's, I think it's kind of a mind blowing thing,\n\n1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:44.860\n but it's very counterintuitive.\n\n1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:47.020\n What are some weird properties of spinners\n\n1:35:47.020 --> 1:35:50.220\n that are counterintuitive?\n\n1:35:50.220 --> 1:35:51.540\n That there are some things that they do,\n\n1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:56.300\n for instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees,\n\n1:35:56.300 --> 1:35:58.260\n it doesn't come back towards,\n\n1:35:58.260 --> 1:36:00.020\n it becomes minus what it was.\n\n1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:04.660\n Or, so it's, anyway, so the way rotations work,\n\n1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:05.900\n there's a kind of a funny sign\n\n1:36:05.900 --> 1:36:08.180\n you have to keep track of in some sense.\n\n1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:11.020\n So they're kind of too valued in another weird way.\n\n1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:14.700\n But the fundamental problem is that it's just not,\n\n1:36:14.700 --> 1:36:17.540\n if you're used to visualizing vectors,\n\n1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:19.600\n you just, there's nothing you can do\n\n1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:20.560\n visualizing in terms of vectors\n\n1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:21.860\n that will ever give you a spinner.\n\n1:36:21.860 --> 1:36:23.820\n It just is not gonna ever work.\n\n1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:26.600\n As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector\n\n1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:29.100\n walking along a Mobius strip,\n\n1:36:29.100 --> 1:36:30.880\n and it ends up being upside down.\n\n1:36:32.460 --> 1:36:34.820\n But you're saying that doesn't really capture.\n\n1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:36.860\n So, I mean, what really captures it?\n\n1:36:36.860 --> 1:36:39.460\n The problem is that it's really,\n\n1:36:39.460 --> 1:36:41.020\n the simplest way to describe it\n\n1:36:41.020 --> 1:36:43.420\n is in terms of two complex numbers.\n\n1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:45.060\n And your problem with two complex numbers\n\n1:36:45.060 --> 1:36:46.820\n is that's four real numbers.\n\n1:36:46.820 --> 1:36:50.540\n So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space.\n\n1:36:50.540 --> 1:36:53.820\n So you, that makes it hard to visualize.\n\n1:36:53.820 --> 1:36:57.540\n And it's crucial that it's not just any four dimensions.\n\n1:36:57.540 --> 1:36:59.340\n It's just, it's actually complex numbers.\n\n1:36:59.340 --> 1:37:01.740\n You're really gonna use the fact that\n\n1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:03.180\n these are two complex numbers.\n\n1:37:03.180 --> 1:37:06.140\n So it's very hard to visualize.\n\n1:37:06.140 --> 1:37:09.300\n But to get back to what I think is mind blowing\n\n1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:11.980\n about twisters is that the,\n\n1:37:11.980 --> 1:37:15.780\n another way of saying this idea about talking about spheres,\n\n1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:18.640\n another way of saying the fundamental idea of twister theory\n\n1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:21.540\n is in some sense, the fundamental idea of twister theory\n\n1:37:21.540 --> 1:37:26.540\n is that a point is a two complex dimensional space.\n\n1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:32.020\n So that every, and that it lives inside,\n\n1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:34.540\n the space that it lies inside is twister space.\n\n1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:36.700\n So in the simplest case, it's four,\n\n1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:38.480\n twister space is four dimensional\n\n1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:40.820\n and a point in space time\n\n1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:44.900\n is a two complex dimensional subspace\n\n1:37:44.900 --> 1:37:47.500\n of all the four complex dimensions.\n\n1:37:47.500 --> 1:37:49.000\n And as you move around in space time,\n\n1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.620\n you're just moving, your planes are just moving around.\n\n1:37:51.620 --> 1:37:52.460\n Okay.\n\n1:37:52.460 --> 1:37:54.540\n And that, but then the.\n\n1:37:54.540 --> 1:37:56.980\n So it's a plane in a four dimensional space.\n\n1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:58.660\n It's a plane.\n\n1:37:58.660 --> 1:37:59.480\n Complex.\n\n1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:00.320\n Complex plane.\n\n1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:03.060\n So it's two complex dimensions in four complex.\n\n1:38:03.060 --> 1:38:03.900\n Got it.\n\n1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:05.780\n But then to me, the mind blowing thing about this\n\n1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:09.380\n is this then kind of tautologically answers the question\n\n1:38:09.380 --> 1:38:10.380\n is what is a spinner?\n\n1:38:10.380 --> 1:38:14.100\n Well, a spinner is a point.\n\n1:38:14.100 --> 1:38:17.920\n I mean, the space of spinners at a point is the point.\n\n1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:21.520\n In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes.\n\n1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:24.620\n And you want me to, and you're asking what a spinner is.\n\n1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:28.260\n Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that two plane.\n\n1:38:28.260 --> 1:38:31.820\n So it's, you know, just your whole definition\n\n1:38:31.820 --> 1:38:33.380\n of what a point in space time was\n\n1:38:33.380 --> 1:38:35.180\n just told you what a spinner was.\n\n1:38:35.180 --> 1:38:37.220\n It's, they're just, it's the same thing.\n\n1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:38.500\n Yeah, but we're trying to project that\n\n1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:39.760\n into a three dimensional space\n\n1:38:39.760 --> 1:38:42.300\n and trying to intuit, but you can't.\n\n1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:44.140\n Yeah, so the intuition becomes very difficult,\n\n1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:49.140\n but from, if you don't, not using twister theory,\n\n1:38:49.740 --> 1:38:51.300\n you have to kind of go through a certain\n\n1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:54.600\n fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe spinners\n\n1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:55.980\n to describe electrons.\n\n1:38:55.980 --> 1:38:57.220\n Whereas using twister theory,\n\n1:38:57.220 --> 1:38:58.820\n it's just completely tautological.\n\n1:38:58.820 --> 1:39:03.100\n They're just what you want to describe.\n\n1:39:03.100 --> 1:39:05.980\n The electron is fundamentally the way\n\n1:39:05.980 --> 1:39:08.180\n that you're describing the point in space time already.\n\n1:39:08.180 --> 1:39:09.880\n It's just there, so.\n\n1:39:10.740 --> 1:39:11.580\n Do you have a hope?\n\n1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:14.940\n You mentioned that you found it appealing recently.\n\n1:39:14.940 --> 1:39:17.260\n Is it just because of certain aspects\n\n1:39:17.260 --> 1:39:18.500\n of its mathematical beauty,\n\n1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:19.660\n or do you actually have a hope\n\n1:39:19.660 --> 1:39:22.580\n that this might lead to a theory of everything?\n\n1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:25.120\n Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope\n\n1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:27.980\n because what I've found, I think the thing which I've done,\n\n1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:29.740\n which I don't think, as far as I can tell,\n\n1:39:29.740 --> 1:39:33.380\n no one had really looked at from this point of view before\n\n1:39:33.380 --> 1:39:38.380\n is, has to do with this question of how do you treat time\n\n1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.840\n in your quantum theory?\n\n1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:44.440\n And so there's another long story\n\n1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:46.700\n about how we do quantum theories\n\n1:39:46.700 --> 1:39:48.700\n and about how we treat time in quantum theories,\n\n1:39:48.700 --> 1:39:51.780\n which is a long story.\n\n1:39:51.780 --> 1:39:55.580\n But the short version of it is that what people have found\n\n1:39:55.580 --> 1:39:58.460\n when you try and write down a quantum theory,\n\n1:39:58.460 --> 1:40:03.460\n that it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate,\n\n1:40:05.220 --> 1:40:07.100\n whatever you're using to your time coordinate,\n\n1:40:07.100 --> 1:40:09.920\n and multiply it by the square root of minus one\n\n1:40:09.920 --> 1:40:11.980\n and to make it purely imaginary.\n\n1:40:11.980 --> 1:40:13.580\n And so all these formulas,\n\n1:40:13.580 --> 1:40:18.460\n which you have in your standard theory,\n\n1:40:18.460 --> 1:40:19.900\n if you do that to those,\n\n1:40:19.900 --> 1:40:23.660\n I mean, those formulas have some very strange behavior\n\n1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:25.380\n and they're kind of singular.\n\n1:40:25.380 --> 1:40:27.800\n If you ask even some simple questions,\n\n1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:31.020\n you have to take very delicate singular limits\n\n1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:33.260\n in order to get the correct answer,\n\n1:40:33.260 --> 1:40:35.060\n and you have to take them from the right direction,\n\n1:40:35.060 --> 1:40:36.980\n otherwise it doesn't work.\n\n1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:39.980\n Whereas if you just take time,\n\n1:40:39.980 --> 1:40:42.120\n and if you just put a factor of square root of minus one,\n\n1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:44.240\n wherever you see the time coordinate,\n\n1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:47.340\n you end up with much simpler formulas,\n\n1:40:47.340 --> 1:40:49.900\n which are much better behaved mathematically.\n\n1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:52.900\n And what I hadn't really appreciated until fairly recently\n\n1:40:52.900 --> 1:40:55.500\n is also how dramatically that changes\n\n1:40:55.500 --> 1:40:57.260\n the whole structure of the theory.\n\n1:40:57.260 --> 1:40:59.800\n You end up with a consistent way of talking\n\n1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:01.600\n about these quantum theories,\n\n1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:04.280\n but it has some very different flavor\n\n1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:07.380\n and very different aspects that I hadn't really appreciated.\n\n1:41:07.380 --> 1:41:10.900\n And in particular, the way symmetries act on it\n\n1:41:10.900 --> 1:41:15.060\n is not at all what I originally had expected.\n\n1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:17.660\n And so that's the new thing that I have,\n\n1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:19.580\n or I think gives you something,\n\n1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:21.820\n is to do this move,\n\n1:41:21.820 --> 1:41:26.340\n which people often think of as just kind of a mathematical\n\n1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:27.380\n trick that you're doing\n\n1:41:27.380 --> 1:41:29.780\n to make some formulas work out nicely,\n\n1:41:29.780 --> 1:41:33.180\n but to take that mathematical trick as really fundamental.\n\n1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:35.940\n And it turns out in Twister theory\n\n1:41:35.940 --> 1:41:39.540\n allows you to simultaneously talk about your usual time\n\n1:41:39.540 --> 1:41:41.900\n and the time times the square root of minus one,\n\n1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:45.500\n they both fit very nicely into Twister theory.\n\n1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:48.380\n And you end up with some structures\n\n1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:50.460\n which look a lot like the standard models.\n\n1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:54.140\n Well, let me ask you about some Nobel prizes.\n\n1:41:54.140 --> 1:41:55.300\n Okay.\n\n1:41:55.300 --> 1:41:56.660\n Do you think there will be,\n\n1:41:56.660 --> 1:42:01.660\n there was a bet between Michio Kaku\n\n1:42:01.780 --> 1:42:04.100\n and somebody else about.\n\n1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:05.020\n John Horgan.\n\n1:42:05.020 --> 1:42:07.380\n John Horgan about,\n\n1:42:07.380 --> 1:42:09.140\n by the way, maybe discover a cool website,\n\n1:42:09.140 --> 1:42:11.140\n longbets.com or.org.\n\n1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:11.980\n Better, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:42:11.980 --> 1:42:12.980\n Yeah, it's cool.\n\n1:42:12.980 --> 1:42:15.340\n It's cool that you can make a bet with people\n\n1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:18.860\n and then check in 20 years later.\n\n1:42:18.860 --> 1:42:19.700\n I really love it.\n\n1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:21.300\n There's a lot of interesting bets on there.\n\n1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:22.460\n I would love to participate,\n\n1:42:22.460 --> 1:42:24.020\n but it's interesting to see,\n\n1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:27.460\n time flies and you make a bet about\n\n1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:28.900\n what's going to happen in 20 years.\n\n1:42:28.900 --> 1:42:31.900\n You don't realize 20 years just goes like this.\n\n1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.700\n And then you get to face out\n\n1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:38.700\n and you get to wonder what was that person?\n\n1:42:39.620 --> 1:42:41.060\n What was I thinking?\n\n1:42:41.060 --> 1:42:42.780\n That person 20 years ago\n\n1:42:42.780 --> 1:42:43.900\n was almost like a different person.\n\n1:42:43.900 --> 1:42:46.340\n What was I thinking back then to think that?\n\n1:42:46.340 --> 1:42:47.500\n It's interesting.\n\n1:42:47.500 --> 1:42:49.620\n So let me ask you this on record,\n\n1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:54.020\n 20 years from now or some number of years from now,\n\n1:42:54.020 --> 1:42:55.780\n do you think there will be a Nobel Prize given\n\n1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:58.300\n for something directly connected\n\n1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:01.740\n to a first broadly theory of everything?\n\n1:43:01.740 --> 1:43:05.980\n And second, of course, one of the possibilities,\n\n1:43:05.980 --> 1:43:08.240\n one of them, string theory?\n\n1:43:10.940 --> 1:43:13.420\n String theory, definitely not.\n\n1:43:13.420 --> 1:43:16.180\n Things have gone, yeah.\n\n1:43:16.180 --> 1:43:18.140\n So if you were giving financial advice,\n\n1:43:18.140 --> 1:43:19.140\n you would say not to bet on that?\n\n1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:20.380\n No, do not.\n\n1:43:20.380 --> 1:43:22.660\n And even, I actually suspect\n\n1:43:22.660 --> 1:43:24.260\n if you ask string theorists that question,\n\n1:43:24.260 --> 1:43:27.500\n you're gonna get a few of them saying,\n\n1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:29.620\n I mean, if you'd asked them that question 20 years ago,\n\n1:43:29.620 --> 1:43:32.140\n again, when Kaku was making this bet or whatever,\n\n1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:35.460\n I think some of them would have taken you up on it.\n\n1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:37.020\n And certainly back in 1984,\n\n1:43:37.020 --> 1:43:39.020\n a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure, yeah.\n\n1:43:39.020 --> 1:43:41.420\n But now I get the impression that\n\n1:43:43.060 --> 1:43:45.700\n even they realize that things are not looking good\n\n1:43:45.700 --> 1:43:46.900\n for that particular idea.\n\n1:43:46.900 --> 1:43:48.620\n Again, it depends what you mean by string theory,\n\n1:43:48.620 --> 1:43:51.940\n whether maybe the term will evolve to mean something else,\n\n1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.800\n which will work out.\n\n1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:57.400\n But I don't think that's not gonna like it to work out,\n\n1:43:57.400 --> 1:43:59.060\n whether something else.\n\n1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:01.220\n I mean, I still think it's relatively unlikely\n\n1:44:01.220 --> 1:44:04.940\n that you'll have any really successful theory of everything.\n\n1:44:04.940 --> 1:44:07.480\n And the main problem is just the,\n\n1:44:08.900 --> 1:44:11.980\n it's become so difficult to do experiments at higher energy\n\n1:44:11.980 --> 1:44:13.620\n that we've really lost this ability\n\n1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:18.620\n to kind of get unexpected input from experiment.\n\n1:44:19.140 --> 1:44:22.260\n And you can, while it's maybe hard to figure out\n\n1:44:22.260 --> 1:44:24.900\n what people's thinking is gonna be 20 years from now,\n\n1:44:24.900 --> 1:44:28.780\n looking at high energy particle,\n\n1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:30.940\n high energy colliders and their technology,\n\n1:44:30.940 --> 1:44:33.580\n it's actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess\n\n1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:37.300\n what you're gonna be doing 20 years from now.\n\n1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:42.300\n And I think actually, I would actually claim that\n\n1:44:42.300 --> 1:44:44.540\n it's pretty clear where you're gonna be 20 years from now.\n\n1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:47.540\n And what it's gonna be is you're gonna have the LHC,\n\n1:44:50.020 --> 1:44:51.500\n you're gonna have a lot more data,\n\n1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:56.100\n an order of magnitude or more data from the LHC,\n\n1:44:56.100 --> 1:44:57.580\n but at the same energy.\n\n1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:01.940\n You're not gonna see a higher energy accelerator\n\n1:45:01.940 --> 1:45:05.340\n operating successfully in the next 20 years.\n\n1:45:05.340 --> 1:45:08.140\n And like maybe machine learning\n\n1:45:08.140 --> 1:45:10.240\n or great sort of data science methodologies\n\n1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:12.580\n that process that data will not reveal\n\n1:45:12.580 --> 1:45:17.380\n any major shifts in our understanding\n\n1:45:17.380 --> 1:45:19.180\n of the underlying physics, you think?\n\n1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:20.020\n I don't think so.\n\n1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:23.060\n I mean, I think that field, my understanding\n\n1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:26.940\n is they're starting to make a great use of those techniques,\n\n1:45:26.940 --> 1:45:29.540\n but it seems to look like it will help them\n\n1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:30.980\n solve certain technical problems\n\n1:45:30.980 --> 1:45:32.500\n and be able to do things somewhat better,\n\n1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:36.600\n but not completely change the way they're looking at things.\n\n1:45:36.600 --> 1:45:39.580\n What do you think about the potential quantum computers\n\n1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:41.300\n simulating quantum mechanical systems\n\n1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:46.300\n and through that sneak up to sort of through simulation,\n\n1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:51.540\n sneak up to a deep understanding of the fundamental physics?\n\n1:45:51.540 --> 1:45:54.780\n The problem there is that that's promising more\n\n1:45:54.780 --> 1:45:59.420\n for this, for Phil Anderson's problem,\n\n1:45:59.420 --> 1:46:03.180\n that if you wanna, there's lots and lots of,\n\n1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:08.580\n you start putting together lots and lots of things\n\n1:46:08.580 --> 1:46:11.060\n and we think we know they're pair by pair interactions,\n\n1:46:11.060 --> 1:46:13.380\n but what this thing is gonna do,\n\n1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:16.540\n we don't have any good calculational techniques.\n\n1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:19.540\n Quantum computers may very well give you those.\n\n1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:21.660\n And so they may, what we think of\n\n1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:23.260\n is kind of a strong coupling behavior.\n\n1:46:23.260 --> 1:46:25.220\n We have no good way to calculate.\n\n1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:28.300\n Even though we can write down the theory,\n\n1:46:28.300 --> 1:46:31.580\n we don't know how to calculate anything with any accuracy\n\n1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:34.620\n and the quantum computer may solve that problem.\n\n1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.660\n But the problem is that I don't think\n\n1:46:36.660 --> 1:46:38.140\n that they're gonna solve the problem\n\n1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:39.220\n that they help you with the problem\n\n1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:41.860\n of not having the, of knowing\n\n1:46:41.860 --> 1:46:44.220\n what the right underlying theory is.\n\n1:46:44.220 --> 1:46:48.580\n As somebody who likes experimental validation,\n\n1:46:48.580 --> 1:46:51.300\n let me ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding,\n\n1:46:51.300 --> 1:46:53.300\n but I don't think it's actually a ridiculous question\n\n1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:56.700\n of do you think we live in a simulation?\n\n1:46:56.700 --> 1:46:58.340\n Do you find that thought experiment\n\n1:46:58.340 --> 1:47:00.220\n at all useful or interesting?\n\n1:47:00.220 --> 1:47:03.680\n Not really, I don't, it just doesn't.\n\n1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:08.680\n Yeah, anyway, to me, it doesn't actually lead\n\n1:47:08.700 --> 1:47:11.980\n to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere interesting.\n\n1:47:11.980 --> 1:47:15.540\n Yeah, to me, so maybe I'll throw a wrench into your thing.\n\n1:47:16.700 --> 1:47:17.860\n To me, it's super interesting\n\n1:47:17.860 --> 1:47:19.620\n from an engineering perspective.\n\n1:47:19.620 --> 1:47:21.860\n So if you look at virtual reality systems,\n\n1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:28.140\n the actual question is how much computation\n\n1:47:28.220 --> 1:47:32.980\n and how difficult is it to construct a world\n\n1:47:32.980 --> 1:47:35.780\n that like there are several levels here.\n\n1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:39.700\n One is you won't know the difference,\n\n1:47:39.700 --> 1:47:41.340\n our human perception systems\n\n1:47:41.340 --> 1:47:42.720\n and maybe even the tools of physics\n\n1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:43.820\n won't know the difference\n\n1:47:43.820 --> 1:47:46.180\n between the simulated world and the real world.\n\n1:47:47.160 --> 1:47:51.020\n That's sort of more of a physics question.\n\n1:47:51.020 --> 1:47:53.060\n The most interesting question to me\n\n1:47:53.060 --> 1:47:55.740\n has more to do with why food tastes delicious,\n\n1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:58.700\n which is create how difficult\n\n1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:00.380\n and how much computation is required\n\n1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:02.860\n to construct a simulation\n\n1:48:02.860 --> 1:48:06.100\n where you kind of know it's a simulation at first,\n\n1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:07.860\n but you want to stay there anyway.\n\n1:48:07.860 --> 1:48:12.860\n And over time, you don't even remember.\n\n1:48:13.340 --> 1:48:15.860\n Yeah, well, anyway, I agree,\n\n1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:18.340\n these are kind of fascinating questions\n\n1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:20.020\n and they may be very, very relevant\n\n1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:21.900\n to our future as a species,\n\n1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:26.060\n but yeah, they're just very far from anything I think.\n\n1:48:26.060 --> 1:48:27.580\n Well, so from a physics perspective,\n\n1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:29.420\n it's not useful to you to think,\n\n1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:32.380\n taking a computational perspective to our universe,\n\n1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:35.140\n thinking of it as an information processing system\n\n1:48:35.140 --> 1:48:37.420\n and then they give it as doing computation\n\n1:48:37.420 --> 1:48:39.440\n and then you think about the resources required\n\n1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:42.260\n to do that kind of computation and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:48:42.260 --> 1:48:43.820\n You could just look at the basic physics\n\n1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:46.700\n and who cares what the computer it's running on is.\n\n1:48:46.700 --> 1:48:48.020\n Yeah, it just, I mean, the kinds of,\n\n1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:49.940\n I mean, I'm willing to agree\n\n1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:51.860\n that you can get into interesting kinds of questions\n\n1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:52.820\n going down that road,\n\n1:48:52.820 --> 1:48:55.220\n but they're just so different from anything\n\n1:48:55.220 --> 1:48:57.420\n from what I've found interesting and I just,\n\n1:48:57.420 --> 1:49:01.280\n again, I just have to kind of go back to life is too short\n\n1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:03.700\n and I'm very glad other people are thinking about this,\n\n1:49:03.700 --> 1:49:07.600\n but I just don't see anything I can do with it.\n\n1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:11.480\n What about space itself?\n\n1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:13.220\n So I have to ask you about aliens.\n\n1:49:14.300 --> 1:49:17.680\n Again, something, since you emphasize evidence,\n\n1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:20.820\n do you think there is, how many,\n\n1:49:20.820 --> 1:49:23.000\n do you think there are and how many\n\n1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.900\n intelligent alien civilizations are out there?\n\n1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:28.540\n Yeah, I have no idea, but I have certainly,\n\n1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:30.700\n as far as I know, unless the government's covering it up\n\n1:49:30.700 --> 1:49:32.980\n or something, we haven't heard from,\n\n1:49:32.980 --> 1:49:35.780\n we don't have any evidence for such things yet,\n\n1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:37.540\n but there seems to be no,\n\n1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:43.220\n there's no particular obstruction why there shouldn't be, so.\n\n1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:47.460\n I mean, do you, you work on some fundamental questions\n\n1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:49.140\n about the physics of reality.\n\n1:49:49.140 --> 1:49:51.620\n When you look up to the stars,\n\n1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:55.260\n do you think about whether somebody's looking back at us?\n\n1:49:55.260 --> 1:49:56.100\n Yes, yeah, well, actually,\n\n1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:58.140\n I originally got interested in physics.\n\n1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:00.180\n I actually started out as a kid interested in astronomy,\n\n1:50:00.180 --> 1:50:02.300\n exactly that, and a telescope and whatever that,\n\n1:50:02.300 --> 1:50:05.620\n and certainly read a lot of science fiction\n\n1:50:05.620 --> 1:50:08.340\n and thought about that.\n\n1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:12.020\n I find over the years, I find myself kind of less,\n\n1:50:12.020 --> 1:50:15.100\n anyway, less and less interested in that one,\n\n1:50:15.100 --> 1:50:18.100\n just because I don't really know what to do with them.\n\n1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:20.420\n I also kind of, at some point,\n\n1:50:20.420 --> 1:50:23.060\n kind of stopped reading science fiction that much,\n\n1:50:23.060 --> 1:50:25.140\n kind of feeling that there was just too,\n\n1:50:25.140 --> 1:50:27.100\n that the actual science I was kind of learning about\n\n1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:29.920\n was perfectly kind of weird and fascinating,\n\n1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:33.140\n and unusual enough, and better than any of the stuff\n\n1:50:33.140 --> 1:50:36.620\n that Isaac Asimov, so why should I?\n\n1:50:36.620 --> 1:50:39.740\n Yeah, and you can mess with the science\n\n1:50:39.740 --> 1:50:42.300\n much more than the distant science fiction,\n\n1:50:43.180 --> 1:50:45.400\n the one that exists in our imagination\n\n1:50:45.400 --> 1:50:48.320\n or the one that exists out there among the stars.\n\n1:50:49.500 --> 1:50:51.180\n Well, you mentioned science fiction.\n\n1:50:51.180 --> 1:50:54.060\n You've written quite a few book reviews.\n\n1:50:54.060 --> 1:50:56.420\n I gotta ask you about some books, perhaps,\n\n1:50:56.420 --> 1:50:57.580\n if you don't mind.\n\n1:50:57.580 --> 1:51:02.580\n Is there one or two books that you would recommend to others\n\n1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:07.020\n and maybe if you can, what ideas you drew from them?\n\n1:51:09.300 --> 1:51:12.660\n Either negative recommendations or positive recommendations.\n\n1:51:12.660 --> 1:51:15.220\n Do not read this book for sure.\n\n1:51:15.220 --> 1:51:18.260\n Well, I must say, I mean, unfortunately,\n\n1:51:18.260 --> 1:51:19.860\n yeah, you can go to my website\n\n1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:21.700\n and you can click on book reviews\n\n1:51:21.700 --> 1:51:24.060\n and you can see I've written, read a lot of,\n\n1:51:24.060 --> 1:51:27.180\n a lot of, I mean, as you can tell from my views\n\n1:51:27.180 --> 1:51:28.780\n about string theory, I'm not a fan\n\n1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:31.020\n of a lot of the kind of popular books\n\n1:51:31.020 --> 1:51:32.740\n about, oh, isn't string theory great?\n\n1:51:32.740 --> 1:51:37.660\n And yes, I'm not a fan of a lot of things of that kind.\n\n1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:40.420\n Can I ask you a quick question on this, a small tangent?\n\n1:51:41.420 --> 1:51:46.420\n Are you a fan, can you explore the pros and cons\n\n1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:50.700\n of, if I get string theory, sort of science communication,\n\n1:51:51.620 --> 1:51:56.620\n sort of Cosmos style communication of concepts\n\n1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:59.040\n to people that are outside of physics,\n\n1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:02.240\n outside of mathematics, outside of even the sciences\n\n1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:04.780\n and helping people to sort of dream\n\n1:52:04.780 --> 1:52:07.560\n and fill them with awe about the full range\n\n1:52:07.560 --> 1:52:09.080\n of mysteries in our universe?\n\n1:52:10.420 --> 1:52:11.260\n That's a complicated issue.\n\n1:52:11.260 --> 1:52:13.680\n You know, I think, you know, I certainly go back\n\n1:52:13.680 --> 1:52:15.680\n and go back to like what inspired me\n\n1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:18.440\n and maybe to connect it a little bit\n\n1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:19.320\n to this question about books.\n\n1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:21.540\n I mean, certainly when the books,\n\n1:52:21.540 --> 1:52:23.980\n some books that I remember reading when I was a kid\n\n1:52:23.980 --> 1:52:26.280\n were about the early history of quantum mechanics,\n\n1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:29.080\n like Heisenberg's books that he wrote about, you know,\n\n1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:31.120\n kind of looking back at telling the history\n\n1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:32.960\n of what happened when he developed quantum mechanics.\n\n1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:36.640\n It's just kind of a totally fascinating, romantic,\n\n1:52:36.640 --> 1:52:40.040\n great story, and those were very inspirational to me.\n\n1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.840\n And I would think maybe other people\n\n1:52:41.840 --> 1:52:45.160\n might also find them that, but the...\n\n1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:47.240\n And that's almost like the human story\n\n1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.120\n of the development of the ideas.\n\n1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:51.800\n Yeah, the human story, but yeah, just also how, you know,\n\n1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:53.760\n there are these very, very weird ideas\n\n1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:54.800\n that didn't seem to make sense,\n\n1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:56.280\n and how they were struggling with them\n\n1:52:56.280 --> 1:52:58.320\n and how, you know, they actually...\n\n1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:01.840\n Anyway, it's, I think it's the period of physics\n\n1:53:01.840 --> 1:53:06.080\n kind of beginning, you know, 1905 with Planck and Einstein\n\n1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:08.400\n and ending up with the war\n\n1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:11.280\n when these things get used to, you know,\n\n1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:14.060\n make massively destructive weapons.\n\n1:53:14.060 --> 1:53:15.720\n It's just the truly amazing...\n\n1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:17.580\n And so many, so many new ideas.\n\n1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:19.800\n Let me, on another, a tangent on top of a tangent\n\n1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:21.500\n on top of a tangent, ask,\n\n1:53:21.500 --> 1:53:26.500\n if we didn't have Einstein, so how does science progress?\n\n1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:28.980\n Is it the lone geniuses?\n\n1:53:28.980 --> 1:53:32.980\n Or is it some kind of weird network of ideas\n\n1:53:32.980 --> 1:53:36.620\n swimming in the air and just kind of the geniuses\n\n1:53:36.620 --> 1:53:39.260\n pop up to catch them and others would anyway?\n\n1:53:39.260 --> 1:53:42.580\n Without Einstein, would we have special relativity,\n\n1:53:42.580 --> 1:53:43.740\n general relativity?\n\n1:53:44.740 --> 1:53:47.260\n I mean, it's an interesting case to case basis.\n\n1:53:47.260 --> 1:53:51.820\n I mean, special relativity, I think we would have had,\n\n1:53:51.820 --> 1:53:53.940\n I mean, there are other people.\n\n1:53:53.940 --> 1:53:56.700\n Anyway, you could even argue that it was already there\n\n1:53:56.700 --> 1:53:57.900\n in some form in some ways,\n\n1:53:57.900 --> 1:54:00.340\n but I think special relativity you would have had\n\n1:54:00.340 --> 1:54:03.300\n without Einstein fairly quickly.\n\n1:54:03.300 --> 1:54:07.580\n General relativity, that was a much, much harder thing to do\n\n1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:11.700\n and required a much more effort, much more sophisticated.\n\n1:54:11.700 --> 1:54:13.960\n That I think you would have had sooner or later,\n\n1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:16.820\n but it would have taken quite a bit longer.\n\n1:54:16.820 --> 1:54:20.500\n That took a bunch of years to validate scientifically,\n\n1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:21.700\n the general relativity.\n\n1:54:21.700 --> 1:54:24.540\n But even for Einstein, from the point where he had\n\n1:54:24.540 --> 1:54:26.820\n kind of a general idea of what he was trying to do\n\n1:54:26.820 --> 1:54:29.900\n to the point where he actually had a well defined theory\n\n1:54:29.900 --> 1:54:31.840\n that you could actually compare to the real world,\n\n1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:35.340\n that was, I forget the number of the order of magnitude,\n\n1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:36.720\n 10 years of very serious work.\n\n1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:39.740\n And if he hadn't been around to do that,\n\n1:54:39.740 --> 1:54:41.900\n it would have taken a while before anyone else\n\n1:54:41.900 --> 1:54:43.060\n got around to it.\n\n1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:45.020\n On the other hand, there are things like,\n\n1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:50.020\n with quantum mechanics, you have Heisenberg and Schrodinger\n\n1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:55.140\n came up with two, which ultimately equivalent,\n\n1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:58.180\n but two different approaches to it\n\n1:54:58.180 --> 1:54:59.620\n within months of each other.\n\n1:54:59.620 --> 1:55:02.380\n And so if Heisenberg hadn't been there,\n\n1:55:02.380 --> 1:55:04.020\n you already would have had Schrodinger or whatever.\n\n1:55:04.020 --> 1:55:05.180\n And if neither of them had been there,\n\n1:55:05.180 --> 1:55:07.580\n it would have been somebody else a few months later.\n\n1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:12.420\n So there are times when the, just the,\n\n1:55:12.420 --> 1:55:16.540\n a lot often is the combination of the right ideas\n\n1:55:16.540 --> 1:55:19.600\n are in place and the right experimental data is in place\n\n1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:20.780\n to point in the right direction.\n\n1:55:20.780 --> 1:55:24.140\n And it's just waiting for somebody who's gonna find it.\n\n1:55:25.620 --> 1:55:28.380\n Maybe to go back to your aliens,\n\n1:55:28.380 --> 1:55:30.780\n I guess the one thing that I often wonder about aliens is,\n\n1:55:30.780 --> 1:55:33.940\n would they have the same fundamental physics ideas\n\n1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:35.600\n as we have in mathematics?\n\n1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:38.620\n Would their math, you know, would they, you know,\n\n1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:42.140\n how much is this really intrinsic to our minds?\n\n1:55:42.140 --> 1:55:43.780\n If you start out with a different kind of mind\n\n1:55:43.780 --> 1:55:46.140\n when you end up with a different ideas\n\n1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:47.340\n of what fundamental physics is\n\n1:55:47.340 --> 1:55:49.820\n or what the structure of mathematics is.\n\n1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:54.160\n So this is why, like if I was, you know,\n\n1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:56.460\n I like video games, the way I would do it\n\n1:55:56.460 --> 1:55:59.560\n as a curious being, so first experiment I'd like to do\n\n1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:02.560\n is run Earth over many thousands of times\n\n1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:06.700\n and see if our particular, no, you know what?\n\n1:56:06.700 --> 1:56:08.140\n I wouldn't do the full evolution.\n\n1:56:08.140 --> 1:56:10.180\n I would start at Homo sapiens first\n\n1:56:10.180 --> 1:56:12.620\n and then see the evolution of Homo sapiens\n\n1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:15.620\n millions of times and see how the ideas\n\n1:56:15.620 --> 1:56:16.500\n of science would evolve.\n\n1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:19.700\n Like, would you get, like how would physics evolve?\n\n1:56:19.700 --> 1:56:21.340\n How would math evolves?\n\n1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:22.720\n I would particularly just be curious\n\n1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:24.760\n about the notation they come up with.\n\n1:56:25.920 --> 1:56:28.420\n Every once in a while I would like throw miracles\n\n1:56:28.420 --> 1:56:31.180\n at them to like, to mess with them and stuff.\n\n1:56:31.180 --> 1:56:33.260\n And then I would also like to run Earth\n\n1:56:33.260 --> 1:56:35.460\n from the very beginning to see if evolution\n\n1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:37.220\n will produce different kinds of brains\n\n1:56:37.220 --> 1:56:38.820\n that would then produce different kinds\n\n1:56:38.820 --> 1:56:40.220\n of mathematics and physics.\n\n1:56:40.220 --> 1:56:43.460\n And then finally, I would probably millions of times\n\n1:56:43.460 --> 1:56:46.980\n run the universe over to see what kind of,\n\n1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:52.260\n what kind of environments and what kind of life\n\n1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:55.400\n would be created to then lead to intelligent life,\n\n1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:59.100\n to then lead to theories of mathematics and physics\n\n1:56:59.100 --> 1:57:00.840\n and to see the full range.\n\n1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:04.940\n And like, sort of like Darwin kind of mark, okay.\n\n1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:09.940\n It took them, what is it, several hundred million years\n\n1:57:10.260 --> 1:57:13.780\n to come up with calculus.\n\n1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:16.020\n I would just like keep noting how long it took\n\n1:57:16.020 --> 1:57:19.020\n and get an average and see which ideas are difficult,\n\n1:57:19.020 --> 1:57:23.420\n which are not and then conclusively sort of figure out\n\n1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:27.340\n if it's more collective intelligence\n\n1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:30.180\n or singular intelligence that's responsible for shifts\n\n1:57:30.180 --> 1:57:33.820\n and for big phase shifts and breakthroughs in science.\n\n1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:36.380\n If I was playing a video game and ran,\n\n1:57:36.380 --> 1:57:38.260\n I got a chance to run this whole thing.\n\n1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:41.620\n Yeah, but we're talking about books\n\n1:57:41.620 --> 1:57:42.460\n before I distracted us horribly.\n\n1:57:42.460 --> 1:57:44.420\n About books, okay, so books, yeah, go back, books.\n\n1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:47.180\n Yeah, so and then, yeah, so that's one thing I'd recommend\n\n1:57:47.180 --> 1:57:50.660\n is the books about the, from the original people,\n\n1:57:50.660 --> 1:57:53.640\n especially Heisenberg about the, how that happened.\n\n1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:55.740\n And there's also a very, very good kind of history\n\n1:57:55.740 --> 1:58:00.460\n of the kind of what happened during this 20th century\n\n1:58:00.460 --> 1:58:05.300\n in physics and up to the time of the Standard Model in 1973.\n\n1:58:05.300 --> 1:58:10.300\n It's called The Second Creation by Bob Kreis and Mann.\n\n1:58:10.380 --> 1:58:11.500\n That's one of the best ones.\n\n1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:14.780\n I know that's, but the one thing that I can say is that,\n\n1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:18.600\n so that book, I think, I forget when it was, late 80s, 90s.\n\n1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:22.200\n The problem is that there just hasn't been much\n\n1:58:22.200 --> 1:58:24.060\n that's actually worked out since then.\n\n1:58:24.060 --> 1:58:26.660\n So most of the books that are kind of trying to tell you\n\n1:58:26.660 --> 1:58:28.400\n about all the glorious things that have happened\n\n1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:32.660\n since 1973 are, they're mostly telling you\n\n1:58:32.660 --> 1:58:33.900\n about how glorious things are,\n\n1:58:33.900 --> 1:58:35.260\n which actually don't really work.\n\n1:58:35.260 --> 1:58:38.580\n And it's really, the argument people sometimes make\n\n1:58:38.580 --> 1:58:41.540\n in favor of these books as well, oh, they're really great\n\n1:58:41.540 --> 1:58:43.780\n because you want to do something that will get kids excited.\n\n1:58:43.780 --> 1:58:45.780\n And then, so they're getting excited about things,\n\n1:58:45.780 --> 1:58:47.700\n something that's not really quite working.\n\n1:58:47.700 --> 1:58:50.720\n It doesn't really matter, the main thing is get them excited.\n\n1:58:50.720 --> 1:58:53.580\n The other argument is, wait a minute,\n\n1:58:53.580 --> 1:58:56.720\n if you're getting people excited about ideas that are wrong,\n\n1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:59.000\n you're really kind of, you're actually kind of discrediting\n\n1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.220\n the whole scientific enterprise in a not really good way.\n\n1:59:02.220 --> 1:59:04.620\n So there's this problem.\n\n1:59:04.620 --> 1:59:07.940\n So my general feeling about expository stuff is, yeah,\n\n1:59:07.940 --> 1:59:10.660\n it's to the extent you can do it kind of honestly\n\n1:59:10.660 --> 1:59:12.780\n and, well, that's great.\n\n1:59:12.780 --> 1:59:14.760\n There are a lot of people doing that now,\n\n1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:19.060\n but to the extent that you're just trying to get people\n\n1:59:20.180 --> 1:59:22.940\n excited and enthusiastic by kind of telling them stuff,\n\n1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:24.420\n which isn't really true,\n\n1:59:24.420 --> 1:59:26.540\n you really shouldn't be doing that.\n\n1:59:26.540 --> 1:59:28.980\n You obviously have a much better intuition about physics.\n\n1:59:28.980 --> 1:59:32.660\n I tend to, in the space of AI, for example,\n\n1:59:32.660 --> 1:59:37.620\n you could use certain kinds of language,\n\n1:59:37.620 --> 1:59:41.300\n like calling things intelligent\n\n1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.340\n that could rub people the wrong way.\n\n1:59:43.340 --> 1:59:46.060\n But I never had a problem with that kind of thing,\n\n1:59:46.060 --> 1:59:48.340\n saying that a program can learn its way\n\n1:59:48.340 --> 1:59:52.180\n without any human supervision as AlphaZero does\n\n1:59:52.180 --> 1:59:53.720\n to play chess.\n\n1:59:53.720 --> 1:59:57.820\n To me, that may not be intelligence,\n\n1:59:57.820 --> 2:00:01.660\n but it sure as heck seems like a few steps\n\n2:00:01.660 --> 2:00:04.500\n down the path towards intelligence.\n\n2:00:04.500 --> 2:00:09.060\n And so I think that's a very peculiar property\n\n2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:10.860\n of systems that can be engineered.\n\n2:00:10.860 --> 2:00:12.460\n So even if the idea is fuzzy,\n\n2:00:12.460 --> 2:00:15.180\n even if you're not really sure what intelligence is,\n\n2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:19.500\n or if you don't have a deep fundamental understanding\n\n2:00:19.500 --> 2:00:21.620\n or even a model what intelligence is,\n\n2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:24.500\n if you build a system that sure as heck is impressive\n\n2:00:24.500 --> 2:00:26.740\n and showing some of the signs\n\n2:00:26.740 --> 2:00:29.740\n of what previously thought impossible\n\n2:00:29.740 --> 2:00:32.940\n for a nonintelligent system,\n\n2:00:32.940 --> 2:00:34.900\n then that's impressive and that's inspiring\n\n2:00:34.900 --> 2:00:36.660\n and that's okay to celebrate.\n\n2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:39.860\n In physics, because you're not engineering anything,\n\n2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:41.820\n you're just now swimming in the space,\n\n2:00:41.820 --> 2:00:43.940\n directly when you do theoretical physics,\n\n2:00:43.940 --> 2:00:45.440\n that it could be more dangerous.\n\n2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:48.740\n You could be out too far away from shore.\n\n2:00:48.740 --> 2:00:52.820\n Yeah, well, the problem, I think physics is,\n\n2:00:52.820 --> 2:00:55.180\n I think it's actually hard for people even to believe\n\n2:00:55.180 --> 2:01:00.140\n or really understand how that this particular kind\n\n2:01:00.140 --> 2:01:02.900\n of physics has gotten itself into a really unusual\n\n2:01:02.900 --> 2:01:05.300\n and strange and historically unusual state,\n\n2:01:05.300 --> 2:01:06.660\n which is not really.\n\n2:01:06.660 --> 2:01:09.500\n I mean, I spent half my life among mathematicians\n\n2:01:09.500 --> 2:01:10.620\n and half of the physicists,\n\n2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:12.860\n and mathematics is kind of doing fine.\n\n2:01:12.860 --> 2:01:14.180\n People are making progress\n\n2:01:14.180 --> 2:01:16.100\n and it has all the usual problems,\n\n2:01:16.100 --> 2:01:19.340\n but also, so you could have a,\n\n2:01:19.340 --> 2:01:21.100\n but I just, I don't know,\n\n2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:23.780\n I've never seen anything at all happening in mathematics\n\n2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:26.340\n like what's happened in this specific area in physics.\n\n2:01:26.340 --> 2:01:29.820\n It's just the kind of sociology of this,\n\n2:01:29.820 --> 2:01:33.580\n the way this field works banging up\n\n2:01:33.580 --> 2:01:37.080\n against this harder problem without anything\n\n2:01:37.080 --> 2:01:38.560\n from experiment to help it.\n\n2:01:38.560 --> 2:01:41.780\n It's really, it's led to some really kind\n\n2:01:41.780 --> 2:01:43.300\n of problematic things.\n\n2:01:43.300 --> 2:01:48.020\n And those, so it's one thing to kind of oversimplify\n\n2:01:48.020 --> 2:01:49.740\n or to slightly misrepresent,\n\n2:01:49.740 --> 2:01:52.380\n to try to explain things in a way that's not quite right,\n\n2:01:52.380 --> 2:01:55.820\n but it's another thing to start promoting to people\n\n2:01:56.740 --> 2:02:00.300\n as a success as ideas, which really completely failed.\n\n2:02:00.300 --> 2:02:03.600\n And so, I mean, I've kind of a very, very specific,\n\n2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:07.500\n if you used to have people, I won't name any names,\n\n2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:09.500\n for instance, coming on certain podcasts like yours,\n\n2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:12.560\n telling the world, this is a huge success\n\n2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:13.740\n and this is really wonderful.\n\n2:02:13.740 --> 2:02:16.520\n And it's just not true.\n\n2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:19.620\n And this is really problematic\n\n2:02:19.620 --> 2:02:23.560\n and it carries a serious danger of once,\n\n2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:27.020\n when people realize that this is what's going on,\n\n2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:32.380\n that the loss of credibility of science\n\n2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:34.700\n is a real, real problem for our society.\n\n2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:39.700\n And you don't want people to have an all too good reason\n\n2:02:39.700 --> 2:02:44.420\n to think that what they're being told\n\n2:02:44.420 --> 2:02:46.860\n by kind of some of the best institutions\n\n2:02:46.860 --> 2:02:49.140\n or a country or authorities is not true.\n\n2:02:49.140 --> 2:02:52.300\n You know, it's not true, it's a problem.\n\n2:02:52.300 --> 2:02:55.860\n That's obviously characteristic of not just physics,\n\n2:02:55.860 --> 2:02:58.940\n it's sociology.\n\n2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:02.940\n And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics,\n\n2:03:02.940 --> 2:03:11.940\n it's the history of politics is you sell ideas to people,\n\n2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:14.020\n even when you don't have any proof\n\n2:03:14.020 --> 2:03:16.060\n that those ideas actually work in the US\n\n2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:17.980\n because if they've worked in that,\n\n2:03:17.980 --> 2:03:20.540\n that seems to be the case throughout history.\n\n2:03:23.700 --> 2:03:26.500\n And just like you said, it's human beings running up\n\n2:03:26.500 --> 2:03:28.500\n against a really hard problem.\n\n2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:33.500\n I'm not sure if this is like a particular like trajectory\n\n2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:37.060\n through the progress of physics\n\n2:03:37.060 --> 2:03:38.380\n that we're dealing with now\n\n2:03:38.380 --> 2:03:40.240\n or it's just a natural progress of science.\n\n2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:44.800\n You run up against a really difficult stage of a field\n\n2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:49.800\n and different people behave differently in the face of that.\n\n2:03:53.100 --> 2:03:56.140\n Some sell books and sort of tell narratives\n\n2:03:56.140 --> 2:03:57.820\n that are beautiful and so on.\n\n2:03:57.820 --> 2:04:00.980\n They're not necessarily grounded in solutions\n\n2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:02.740\n that have proven themselves.\n\n2:04:02.740 --> 2:04:05.460\n Others kind of put their head down quietly,\n\n2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:06.340\n keep doing the work.\n\n2:04:06.340 --> 2:04:08.180\n Others sort of pivot to different fields\n\n2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:11.420\n and that's kind of like, yeah, ants scattering.\n\n2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:14.500\n And then you have fields like machine learning,\n\n2:04:14.500 --> 2:04:17.100\n which there was a few folks mostly scattered away\n\n2:04:17.100 --> 2:04:19.580\n from machine learning in the 90s,\n\n2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:22.980\n in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it.\n\n2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:24.740\n But a few people kept their head down\n\n2:04:24.740 --> 2:04:27.140\n and now they're called the fathers of deep learning.\n\n2:04:27.140 --> 2:04:30.260\n And they didn't think of it that way.\n\n2:04:31.380 --> 2:04:33.300\n And in fact, if there's another AI winter,\n\n2:04:33.300 --> 2:04:35.560\n they'll just probably keep working on it anyway,\n\n2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:40.380\n sort of like loyal ants sticking to a particular thing.\n\n2:04:40.380 --> 2:04:43.140\n So it's interesting, but you're sort of saying\n\n2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:46.660\n that we should be careful over hyping things\n\n2:04:46.660 --> 2:04:48.380\n that have not proven themselves\n\n2:04:48.380 --> 2:04:53.380\n because people will lose trust in the scientific process.\n\n2:04:53.380 --> 2:04:56.780\n But unfortunately, there's been other ways\n\n2:04:56.780 --> 2:04:59.740\n in which people have lost trust in the scientific process.\n\n2:04:59.740 --> 2:05:01.140\n That ultimately has to do actually\n\n2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:04.020\n with all the same kind of behavior as you're highlighting,\n\n2:05:04.020 --> 2:05:07.260\n which is not being honest and transparent\n\n2:05:07.260 --> 2:05:10.620\n about the flaws of mistakes of the past.\n\n2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:12.140\n Yeah, I mean, that's always a problem.\n\n2:05:12.140 --> 2:05:14.700\n But this particular field is kind of fun.\n\n2:05:14.700 --> 2:05:17.780\n It's always a strange one.\n\n2:05:17.780 --> 2:05:19.540\n I mean, I think in the sense that\n\n2:05:20.500 --> 2:05:22.140\n there's a lot of public fascination with it\n\n2:05:22.140 --> 2:05:24.780\n that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions\n\n2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:27.540\n about what is this physical reality?\n\n2:05:27.540 --> 2:05:28.380\n Where do we come from?\n\n2:05:28.380 --> 2:05:30.300\n And these kind of deep issues.\n\n2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:33.060\n So there's this unusual fascination with it.\n\n2:05:33.060 --> 2:05:34.540\n Mathematics is very different.\n\n2:05:34.540 --> 2:05:36.620\n Nobody's that interested in mathematics.\n\n2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:40.580\n Nobody really kind of expects to learn really great,\n\n2:05:40.580 --> 2:05:42.580\n deep things about the world from mathematics that much.\n\n2:05:42.580 --> 2:05:44.180\n They don't ask mathematicians that.\n\n2:05:44.180 --> 2:05:46.660\n So it's a very unusual,\n\n2:05:46.660 --> 2:05:50.140\n it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention.\n\n2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:54.860\n And it really is historically in a really unusual state.\n\n2:05:54.860 --> 2:05:59.860\n It's gotten itself way kind of down a blind alley\n\n2:06:01.220 --> 2:06:04.700\n in a way which it's hard to find\n\n2:06:04.700 --> 2:06:06.500\n other historical parallels to.\n\n2:06:06.500 --> 2:06:08.380\n But sort of to push back a little bit,\n\n2:06:08.380 --> 2:06:10.660\n there's power to inspiring people.\n\n2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:13.140\n And if I just empirically look,\n\n2:06:13.140 --> 2:06:20.140\n physicists are really good at combining science\n\n2:06:21.740 --> 2:06:24.420\n and philosophy and communicating it.\n\n2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:26.220\n Like there's something about physics often\n\n2:06:26.220 --> 2:06:28.900\n that forces you to build a strong intuition\n\n2:06:28.900 --> 2:06:31.300\n about the way reality works, right?\n\n2:06:31.300 --> 2:06:34.260\n And that allows you to think through sort of\n\n2:06:34.260 --> 2:06:37.340\n and communicate about all kinds of questions.\n\n2:06:37.340 --> 2:06:38.780\n Like if you see physicists,\n\n2:06:38.780 --> 2:06:41.140\n it's always fascinating to take on problems\n\n2:06:41.140 --> 2:06:43.500\n that have nothing to do with their particular discipline.\n\n2:06:43.500 --> 2:06:45.900\n They think in interesting ways\n\n2:06:45.900 --> 2:06:47.180\n and they're able to communicate\n\n2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:48.660\n their thinking in interesting ways.\n\n2:06:48.660 --> 2:06:52.180\n And so in some sense, they have a responsibility\n\n2:06:52.180 --> 2:06:55.580\n not just to do science, but to inspire.\n\n2:06:55.580 --> 2:06:58.060\n And not responsibility, but the opportunity.\n\n2:06:58.060 --> 2:07:02.660\n And thereby, I would say a little bit of a responsibility.\n\n2:07:02.660 --> 2:07:03.820\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:07:03.820 --> 2:07:06.340\n But I don't know, anyway, it's hard to say\n\n2:07:06.340 --> 2:07:10.620\n because there's many, many people doing this kind of thing\n\n2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:15.580\n with different degrees of success and whatever.\n\n2:07:15.580 --> 2:07:19.740\n I guess one thing, but I mean,\n\n2:07:19.740 --> 2:07:21.140\n what's kind of front and center for me\n\n2:07:21.140 --> 2:07:22.860\n is kind of a more parochial interest\n\n2:07:22.860 --> 2:07:27.100\n is just kind of what damage do you do\n\n2:07:27.100 --> 2:07:30.100\n to the subject itself, ignoring,\n\n2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:33.460\n okay, misrepresenting what high school students think\n\n2:07:33.460 --> 2:07:36.540\n about string theory and that doesn't matter much,\n\n2:07:36.540 --> 2:07:40.220\n but what the smartest undergraduates\n\n2:07:40.220 --> 2:07:43.140\n or the smartest graduate students in the world think about it\n\n2:07:43.140 --> 2:07:45.140\n and what paths you're leading them down\n\n2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:47.060\n and what story you're telling them\n\n2:07:47.060 --> 2:07:49.580\n and what textbooks you're making them read\n\n2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:51.380\n and what they're hearing.\n\n2:07:51.380 --> 2:07:53.020\n And so a lot of what's motivated me\n\n2:07:53.020 --> 2:07:57.340\n is more to try to speak to this kind of a specific population\n\n2:07:57.340 --> 2:08:00.020\n of people to make sure that, look, people,\n\n2:08:01.660 --> 2:08:05.500\n it doesn't matter so much what the average person\n\n2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:06.980\n on the street thinks about string theory,\n\n2:08:06.980 --> 2:08:11.980\n but what the best students at Columbia or Harvard\n\n2:08:12.060 --> 2:08:14.860\n or Princeton or whatever who really wanna change,\n\n2:08:14.860 --> 2:08:16.620\n work in this field and wanna work that way,\n\n2:08:16.620 --> 2:08:19.300\n what they know about it, what they think about it\n\n2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.020\n and that they not be going to the field being misled\n\n2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:23.820\n and believing that a certain story,\n\n2:08:23.820 --> 2:08:25.060\n this is where this is all going,\n\n2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:29.020\n this is what I gotta do, that's important to me.\n\n2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:31.380\n Well, in general, for graduate students,\n\n2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:34.220\n for people who seek to be experts in the field,\n\n2:08:34.220 --> 2:08:36.460\n diversity of ideas is really powerful\n\n2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:40.700\n and is getting into this local pocket of ideas\n\n2:08:40.700 --> 2:08:43.820\n that people hold on to for several decades is not good,\n\n2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:44.860\n no matter what the idea.\n\n2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:47.860\n I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong,\n\n2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:51.540\n because there's no such thing as right in the long term,\n\n2:08:51.540 --> 2:08:56.380\n like it's right for now until somebody builds on\n\n2:08:56.380 --> 2:08:58.100\n something much bigger on top of it.\n\n2:08:58.100 --> 2:09:00.060\n It might end up being right,\n\n2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:03.500\n but being a tiny subset of a much bigger thing.\n\n2:09:03.500 --> 2:09:07.460\n So you always should question sort of the ways of the past.\n\n2:09:07.460 --> 2:09:10.260\n Yeah, so how to kind of achieve\n\n2:09:10.260 --> 2:09:12.700\n that kind of diversity of thought\n\n2:09:12.700 --> 2:09:15.060\n and within kind of the sociology\n\n2:09:15.060 --> 2:09:17.660\n of how we organize scientific researches.\n\n2:09:17.660 --> 2:09:19.500\n I know this is one thing that I think it's very interesting\n\n2:09:19.500 --> 2:09:22.700\n that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things\n\n2:09:22.700 --> 2:09:23.540\n to say about it.\n\n2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.540\n And I think also Lee Smolin in his book,\n\n2:09:25.540 --> 2:09:29.900\n which is also about that very much in agreement with them\n\n2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:34.900\n that there's a really kind of important questions\n\n2:09:36.780 --> 2:09:41.460\n about how research in this field is organized\n\n2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:46.460\n and what can you do to kind of get more diversity of thought\n\n2:09:46.580 --> 2:09:51.180\n and get people thinking about a wider range of ideas.\n\n2:09:53.100 --> 2:09:55.980\n At the bottom, I think humility always helps.\n\n2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:59.900\n Well, the problem is that it's also,\n\n2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:02.780\n it's a combination of humility to know when you're wrong\n\n2:10:02.780 --> 2:10:06.700\n and also, but also you have to have a certain\n\n2:10:06.700 --> 2:10:08.620\n very serious lack of humility to believe\n\n2:10:08.620 --> 2:10:11.180\n that you're gonna make progress on some of these problems.\n\n2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:13.260\n I think you have to have like both modes\n\n2:10:13.260 --> 2:10:15.600\n and switch between them when needed.\n\n2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:19.460\n Let me ask you a question\n\n2:10:19.460 --> 2:10:21.220\n you're probably not gonna wanna answer\n\n2:10:21.220 --> 2:10:25.460\n because you're focused on the mathematics of things\n\n2:10:25.460 --> 2:10:27.720\n and mathematics can't answer the why questions,\n\n2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:30.620\n but let me ask you anyway.\n\n2:10:30.620 --> 2:10:33.420\n Do you think there's meaning to this whole thing?\n\n2:10:33.420 --> 2:10:34.980\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n2:10:34.980 --> 2:10:36.860\n Why are we here?\n\n2:10:36.860 --> 2:10:37.700\n I don't know.\n\n2:10:37.700 --> 2:10:39.580\n Yeah, I was thinking about this.\n\n2:10:39.580 --> 2:10:42.300\n So the, and it did occur to me,\n\n2:10:42.300 --> 2:10:45.660\n one interesting thing about that question\n\n2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:47.180\n is that you don't,\n\n2:10:47.180 --> 2:10:51.060\n yeah, so I have this life in mathematics\n\n2:10:51.060 --> 2:10:52.020\n and this life in physics\n\n2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:55.900\n and I see some of my physicist colleagues,\n\n2:10:55.900 --> 2:10:59.740\n kind of seem to be, people are often asking them,\n\n2:10:59.740 --> 2:11:00.580\n what's the meaning of life?\n\n2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:02.300\n And they're writing books about the meaning of life\n\n2:11:02.300 --> 2:11:04.580\n and teaching courses about the meaning of life.\n\n2:11:04.580 --> 2:11:06.460\n But then I realized that no one ever asked\n\n2:11:06.460 --> 2:11:07.900\n my mathematician colleagues.\n\n2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:10.660\n Nobody ever asked mathematicians.\n\n2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:11.500\n Yeah, that's funny.\n\n2:11:11.500 --> 2:11:15.020\n So yeah, everybody just kind of assumes,\n\n2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:16.620\n okay, well, you people are studying mathematics,\n\n2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:19.380\n whatever you're doing, it's maybe very interesting,\n\n2:11:19.380 --> 2:11:21.180\n but it's clearly not gonna tell me anything useful\n\n2:11:21.180 --> 2:11:22.300\n about the meaning of my life.\n\n2:11:22.300 --> 2:11:25.820\n And I'm afraid a lot of my point of view is that\n\n2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:28.180\n if people realized how little difference there was\n\n2:11:28.180 --> 2:11:29.700\n between what the mathematicians are doing\n\n2:11:29.700 --> 2:11:32.260\n and what a lot of these theoretical physicists are doing,\n\n2:11:32.260 --> 2:11:35.740\n they might understand that it's a bit misguided\n\n2:11:35.740 --> 2:11:39.020\n to look for deep insight into the meaning of life\n\n2:11:39.020 --> 2:11:42.540\n from many theoretical physicists.\n\n2:11:42.540 --> 2:11:45.580\n It's not, they're people,\n\n2:11:45.580 --> 2:11:47.220\n they may have interesting things to say about this.\n\n2:11:47.220 --> 2:11:50.220\n You're right, they know a lot about physical reality\n\n2:11:50.220 --> 2:11:53.900\n and about, in some sense about metaphysics,\n\n2:11:53.900 --> 2:11:56.740\n about what is real of this kind.\n\n2:11:56.740 --> 2:12:01.740\n But you're also, to my mind,\n\n2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:03.740\n I think you're also making a bit of a mistake\n\n2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:07.940\n that you're looking to, I mean, I'm very, very aware\n\n2:12:07.940 --> 2:12:10.620\n that I've led a very pleasant\n\n2:12:10.620 --> 2:12:11.980\n and fairly privileged existence\n\n2:12:11.980 --> 2:12:15.220\n and fairly without many challenges of different kinds\n\n2:12:15.220 --> 2:12:16.700\n and of a certain kind.\n\n2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:21.460\n And I'm really not in no way the kind of person\n\n2:12:21.460 --> 2:12:24.260\n that a lot of people who are looking for\n\n2:12:24.260 --> 2:12:27.460\n to try to understand in some sense the meaning of life\n\n2:12:27.460 --> 2:12:30.300\n in the sense of the challenges that they're facing in life.\n\n2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:32.660\n I can't really, I'm really the wrong person\n\n2:12:32.660 --> 2:12:34.020\n for you to be asking about this.\n\n2:12:34.020 --> 2:12:39.020\n Well, if struggle is somehow a thing that's core to meaning,\n\n2:12:39.660 --> 2:12:42.460\n perhaps mathematicians are just quietly the ones\n\n2:12:42.460 --> 2:12:45.140\n who are most equipped to answer that question\n\n2:12:45.140 --> 2:12:49.980\n if, in fact, the creation or at least experiencing beauty\n\n2:12:53.660 --> 2:12:55.860\n is at the core of the meaning of life.\n\n2:12:55.860 --> 2:12:59.420\n Because it seems like mathematics is the methodology\n\n2:12:59.420 --> 2:13:04.060\n by which you can most purely explore beautiful things, right?\n\n2:13:04.060 --> 2:13:05.280\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:06.220\n So in some sense,\n\n2:13:06.220 --> 2:13:08.900\n maybe we should talk to mathematicians more.\n\n2:13:08.900 --> 2:13:12.620\n Yeah, yeah, maybe, but unfortunately,\n\n2:13:12.620 --> 2:13:14.900\n people do have a somewhat correct perception\n\n2:13:14.900 --> 2:13:17.100\n that what these people are doing every day\n\n2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:19.700\n or whatever is pretty far removed from anything.\n\n2:13:21.940 --> 2:13:26.140\n Yeah, from what's kind of close to what I do every day\n\n2:13:26.140 --> 2:13:28.060\n and what my typical concerns are.\n\n2:13:28.060 --> 2:13:29.740\n So you may learn something very interesting\n\n2:13:29.740 --> 2:13:31.060\n by talking to mathematicians,\n\n2:13:31.060 --> 2:13:33.940\n but it's probably not gonna be,\n\n2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:37.120\n you're probably not gonna get what you were hoping.\n\n2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:39.540\n So when you put the pen and paper down,\n\n2:13:39.540 --> 2:13:41.460\n you're not thinking about physics\n\n2:13:41.460 --> 2:13:43.380\n and you're not thinking about mathematics\n\n2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:46.820\n and you just get to breathe in the air and look around you\n\n2:13:46.820 --> 2:13:49.220\n and realize that you're going to die one day.\n\n2:13:49.220 --> 2:13:50.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:50.060 --> 2:13:51.160\n Do you think about that?\n\n2:13:53.300 --> 2:13:56.940\n Your ideas will live on, but you, the human.\n\n2:13:56.940 --> 2:13:58.460\n Not especially much.\n\n2:13:58.460 --> 2:14:00.180\n Certainly, I've been getting older.\n\n2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:01.900\n I'm now 64 years old.\n\n2:14:01.900 --> 2:14:02.740\n You start to realize, well,\n\n2:14:02.740 --> 2:14:05.700\n there's probably less ahead than there was behind.\n\n2:14:05.700 --> 2:14:09.580\n And so you start to, that starts to become,\n\n2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:10.420\n what do I think about that?\n\n2:14:10.420 --> 2:14:13.420\n Maybe I should actually get serious\n\n2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:14.740\n about getting some things done,\n\n2:14:14.740 --> 2:14:17.020\n which I may not have,\n\n2:14:17.020 --> 2:14:18.740\n which I may otherwise not have time to do,\n\n2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:20.300\n which I didn't see.\n\n2:14:20.300 --> 2:14:22.220\n And this didn't seem to be a problem when I was younger,\n\n2:14:22.220 --> 2:14:24.060\n but that's the main,\n\n2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:26.860\n I think the main way in which that thought occurred.\n\n2:14:26.860 --> 2:14:30.040\n But it doesn't, you know, the stoics are big on this.\n\n2:14:30.040 --> 2:14:33.460\n Meditating on mortality helps you\n\n2:14:33.460 --> 2:14:36.580\n more intensely appreciate the beauty\n\n2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:38.020\n when you do experience it.\n\n2:14:38.020 --> 2:14:41.140\n I suppose that's true, but it's not,\n\n2:14:41.140 --> 2:14:45.880\n yeah, it's not something I've spent a lot of time trying,\n\n2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:47.180\n but yeah.\n\n2:14:47.180 --> 2:14:49.780\n Day to day, you just enjoy the positives, the mathematics.\n\n2:14:49.780 --> 2:14:52.460\n Just enjoy, yeah, our life in general.\n\n2:14:52.460 --> 2:14:57.120\n Life is, I have a perfectly pleasant life and enjoy it.\n\n2:14:57.120 --> 2:15:00.220\n And I often think, wow, this is,\n\n2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:02.600\n things are, I'm really enjoying this.\n\n2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.300\n Things are going well.\n\n2:15:04.300 --> 2:15:06.540\n Yeah, life is pretty amazing.\n\n2:15:06.540 --> 2:15:08.180\n I think you and I are pretty lucky.\n\n2:15:08.180 --> 2:15:11.300\n We get to live on this nice little earth\n\n2:15:11.300 --> 2:15:13.380\n with a nice little comfortable climate,\n\n2:15:13.380 --> 2:15:17.160\n and we get to have this nice little podcast conversation.\n\n2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:19.100\n Thank you so much for spending your valuable time\n\n2:15:19.100 --> 2:15:21.180\n with me today and having this conversation.\n\n2:15:21.180 --> 2:15:22.020\n Thank you.\n\n2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:23.340\n Glad to, thank you, thank you.\n\n2:15:25.220 --> 2:15:27.960\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter White.\n\n2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:29.260\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:15:29.260 --> 2:15:32.060\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:15:32.060 --> 2:15:34.100\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:15:34.100 --> 2:15:36.180\n from Richard Feynman.\n\n2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:40.220\n The first principle is that you must not fool yourself,\n\n2:15:40.220 --> 2:15:43.120\n and you are the easiest person to fool.\n\n2:15:43.120 --> 2:16:06.120\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
