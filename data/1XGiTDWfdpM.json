rate of profit to fall, and that tendency for the rate of profit to\n\n00:10.580 --> 00:17.760\n fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder, paying them less than their\n\n00:17.760 --> 00:23.000\n subsistence, a revolt by workers against this, and then you would get socialism on\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:24.000\n the other side.\n\n00:24.000 --> 00:29.520\n So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in\n\n00:29.520 --> 00:32.680\n his explanation of why socialism would have to come about.\n\n00:32.680 --> 00:37.760\n If you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in England.\n\n00:37.760 --> 00:41.240\n The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.\n\n00:41.240 --> 00:45.760\n The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition,\n\n00:45.760 --> 00:49.080\n and this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.\n\n00:49.080 --> 00:53.120\n So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks\n\n00:53.120 --> 00:55.600\n believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.\n\n00:55.600 --> 00:58.940\n Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.\n\n00:58.940 --> 01:03.680\n The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.\n\n01:03.680 --> 01:08.040\n The following is a conversation with Steve Keen, a brilliant economist that criticizes\n\n01:08.040 --> 01:13.520\n much of modern economics and proposes new theories and models that integrate some ideas\n\n01:13.520 --> 01:19.160\n and ditch others from very thinkers, from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Hyman\n\n01:19.160 --> 01:20.160\n Minsky.\n\n01:20.160 --> 01:25.940\n In fact, a lot of our conversation is about Karl Marx and Marxian economics.\n\n01:25.940 --> 01:32.160\n He has been a scholar of Karl Marx's work for many years, so this was a fascinating\n\n01:32.160 --> 01:33.160\n exploration.\n\n01:33.160 --> 01:38.160\n He has written several books I recommend, including The New Economics and Manifesto\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:41.820\n and Debunking Economics.\n\n01:41.820 --> 01:43.680\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.\n\n01:43.680 --> 01:47.360\n To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n01:47.360 --> 01:51.640\n And now, dear friends, here's Steve Keen.\n\n01:51.640 --> 01:53.600\n Let's start with a big question.\n\n01:53.600 --> 01:55.880\n What is economics?\n\n01:55.880 --> 01:59.560\n Or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics?\n\n01:59.560 --> 02:03.400\n Well, it should be I understand how human civilization comes about and how it can be\n\n02:03.400 --> 02:05.720\n maintained.\n\n02:05.720 --> 02:08.160\n And that's not what it's been at all.\n\n02:08.160 --> 02:12.360\n So we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul.\n\n02:12.360 --> 02:13.680\n What is the soul of economics?\n\n02:13.680 --> 02:20.400\n The soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization that\n\n02:20.400 --> 02:30.280\n elevates us so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base environment\n\n02:30.280 --> 02:31.280\n of the Earth?\n\n02:31.280 --> 02:35.600\n Because if you think about\u2014and this is actually work I've learned from Tim Garrett, who's\n\n02:35.600 --> 02:41.480\n one of my research colleagues who's an atmospheric physicist\u2014and his idea is that we exploit\n\n02:41.480 --> 02:47.920\n these high grade energy sources from the sun itself to coal, nuclear, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n02:47.920 --> 02:51.960\n which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we'd have if\n\n02:51.960 --> 02:55.400\n we were just still running around with rocks and stones and spears.\n\n02:55.400 --> 03:02.040\n So it's that elevation above the base level of the planet, which is human civilization.\n\n03:02.040 --> 03:06.480\n And if we didn't have this energy we were exploiting, if we didn't use the environment\n\n03:06.480 --> 03:10.840\n to elevate ourselves above what's possible in the background, then you and I wouldn't\n\n03:10.840 --> 03:13.360\n be talking into microphones.\n\n03:13.360 --> 03:17.140\n We might be doing drumbeats and stuff like this, but we wouldn't be having the sort\n\n03:17.140 --> 03:18.680\n of conversation we have.\n\n03:18.680 --> 03:22.480\n So to explain how that came about, that's what the economics should be doing, and it's\n\n03:22.480 --> 03:23.480\n not.\n\n03:23.480 --> 03:26.280\n So this is the greatest thing that the Earth has ever created, is what you're saying,\n\n03:26.280 --> 03:27.280\n this conversation?\n\n03:27.280 --> 03:31.040\n Yeah, we're the most elaborate construction on the planet.\n\n03:31.040 --> 03:34.680\n And that's not what we've done, we've denigrated the planet itself.\n\n03:34.680 --> 03:38.560\n We don't have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation.\n\n03:38.560 --> 03:43.600\n And my ultimate\u2014if I had to see how humanity is going to survive what we're putting ourselves\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:49.360\n through, then we'd have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving\n\n03:49.360 --> 03:51.360\n and respecting life.\n\n03:51.360 --> 04:00.840\n I like how you took my silly, incredible statement and made it into a serious one about how amazing\n\n04:00.840 --> 04:02.000\n life is.\n\n04:02.000 --> 04:07.440\n Life is incredible, and we humans don't respect it enough, we trash it.\n\n04:07.440 --> 04:10.500\n And that's what economics, I think, has played a huge role in that.\n\n04:10.500 --> 04:15.420\n Until I actually regard my discipline, I would never call it a profession, let alone a science.\n\n04:15.420 --> 04:22.780\n My discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential, the feasible termination\n\n04:22.780 --> 04:23.780\n of human civilization.\n\n04:23.780 --> 04:24.780\n Strong words.\n\n04:24.780 --> 04:28.040\n Okay, let's return to the basics of economics.\n\n04:28.040 --> 04:33.200\n So what is the soul and the practice of economics?\n\n04:33.200 --> 04:34.600\n What should be the goal of it?\n\n04:34.600 --> 04:41.520\n Because you're speaking very poetically, but we'll also speak pragmatically about the tools\n\n04:41.520 --> 04:47.280\n of economics, the variables of economics, the metrics, the goals, the models.\n\n04:47.280 --> 04:50.200\n Practically speaking, what are the goals of economics?\n\n04:50.200 --> 04:55.940\n Well, in terms of the tools we use, we should be using the tools that engineers use, frankly.\n\n04:55.940 --> 05:01.000\n And that sounds ridiculously simple, because you would expect that economists are using\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:06.800\n up to date techniques that are common in other sciences, where you're dealing with similar\n\n05:06.800 --> 05:11.880\n ideas of stocks and flows, and interactions between the environment and a system and so\n\n05:11.880 --> 05:12.880\n on.\n\n05:12.880 --> 05:15.080\n And that's fundamentally systems engineering.\n\n05:15.080 --> 05:18.080\n And that's what we should be using as the tools of economics.\n\n05:18.080 --> 05:22.440\n Now if you look at what economists actually do, the sophisticated stuff involves difference\n\n05:22.440 --> 05:25.160\n equations.\n\n05:25.160 --> 05:29.160\n And like difference equations, you know, if you've done enough mathematics as you have,\n\n05:29.160 --> 05:33.400\n you know, difference equations are useful for like individual level processes.\n\n05:33.400 --> 05:38.600\n If you're talking about autonomous, it'll go from state t to t plus one, t plus two,\n\n05:38.600 --> 05:39.600\n and so on.\n\n05:39.600 --> 05:41.400\n But not when you're talking at the aggregate level.\n\n05:41.400 --> 05:44.680\n There you use differential equations to measure it all.\n\n05:44.680 --> 05:46.600\n Economists have been using difference equations.\n\n05:46.600 --> 05:51.200\n So there's like a book, I think it's by Sargent and one other, called Advanced Methods in\n\n05:51.200 --> 05:54.760\n Economics Using Python, two volumes set.\n\n05:54.760 --> 06:00.760\n It's about close to 2,000 pages, and four of those pages are on differential equations.\n\n06:00.760 --> 06:03.060\n The rest is all difference equations.\n\n06:03.060 --> 06:05.920\n So they're using entirely the wrong mathematics to start with.\n\n06:05.920 --> 06:10.000\n For people listening, what is difference equations versus differential equations?\n\n06:10.000 --> 06:12.600\n Difference equation is like you can do in a spreadsheet.\n\n06:12.600 --> 06:18.360\n You'll have, this is the value for 1990, this is the value for 1991, 92, 93, 94.\n\n06:18.360 --> 06:23.800\n So you have discrete jumps in time, whereas the differential equation says there's a process\n\n06:23.800 --> 06:25.800\n moving through time.\n\n06:25.800 --> 06:32.600\n And you will have a rate of change of a variable is a function of the state of itself and other\n\n06:32.600 --> 06:35.780\n variables and rates of change of those variables.\n\n06:35.780 --> 06:38.440\n And that is what you use when you're doing an aggregate model.\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:42.880\n So if you're modeling water, for example, or fluid dynamics, you have a set of differential\n\n06:42.880 --> 06:47.520\n equations describing the entire body of fluid moving through time.\n\n06:47.520 --> 06:52.440\n You don't try to model the discrete motion of each molecule of H2O.\n\n06:52.440 --> 06:56.360\n So at the aggregate level, you use differential equations for processes that occur through\n\n06:56.360 --> 06:57.520\n time.\n\n06:57.520 --> 06:58.520\n And that's economics.\n\n06:58.520 --> 06:59.960\n It occurs through time.\n\n06:59.960 --> 07:02.380\n You should be using that particular technology.\n\n07:02.380 --> 07:07.240\n But some economists do learn differential equations, but they don't learn stability\n\n07:07.240 --> 07:08.240\n analysis.\n\n07:08.240 --> 07:12.280\n So they simply assume equilibrium is stable, and they work in equilibrium terms all the\n\n07:12.280 --> 07:13.280\n time.\n\n07:13.280 --> 07:22.400\n And the technical level, it's an incredibly complicated way of modeling the world using\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:23.960\n entirely the wrong tools.\n\n07:23.960 --> 07:29.640\n OK, we'll talk about that because it's unclear what the right tools are.\n\n07:29.640 --> 07:33.520\n Maybe it's more clear to you, but I've got to make it clear to an audience.\n\n07:33.520 --> 07:36.720\n Well, so this is a very complicated world.\n\n07:36.720 --> 07:37.920\n It's a complex world.\n\n07:37.920 --> 07:46.920\n You talk about there are some of the most complex systems on Earth are the human mind,\n\n07:46.920 --> 07:49.600\n the economy and the biosphere.\n\n07:49.600 --> 07:53.920\n So we'll go, you know, we'll go to that place.\n\n07:53.920 --> 07:56.440\n I'm fascinated by complex systems.\n\n07:56.440 --> 08:03.080\n I'm humbled by them, even at their simplest level of like cellular automata.\n\n08:03.080 --> 08:11.120\n I'm not sure what the right tools are to understand that, especially when part of the complex\n\n08:11.120 --> 08:13.600\n system is like a hierarchy of other complex systems.\n\n08:13.600 --> 08:20.060\n So you said the economy is a fascinating complex system, but it's made up of human minds.\n\n08:20.060 --> 08:21.920\n And those are interesting.\n\n08:21.920 --> 08:26.680\n Those are interesting, perhaps impossible to model, but we can try and we can try to\n\n08:26.680 --> 08:28.160\n figure out how to approximate them.\n\n08:28.160 --> 08:30.200\n And maybe that's the challenge of economics.\n\n08:30.200 --> 08:33.140\n OK, we'll keep returning to the basics.\n\n08:33.140 --> 08:36.360\n Let us try to learn something from history.\n\n08:36.360 --> 08:40.600\n I also see as part of economics is us trying to figure out stuff.\n\n08:40.600 --> 08:46.360\n And there's a few smart folks that write books throughout human history.\n\n08:46.360 --> 08:50.640\n And sometimes they name schools of economics after them.\n\n08:50.640 --> 08:54.560\n So let us take a stroll through history.\n\n08:54.560 --> 08:55.560\n OK.\n\n08:55.560 --> 09:02.500\n Can you describe at a high level what are the different schools of economics, perhaps\n\n09:02.500 --> 09:09.080\n ones that are interesting to you, perhaps ones that the difference between which reveals\n\n09:09.080 --> 09:14.080\n something useful or insightful for our conversation.\n\n09:14.080 --> 09:22.400\n So you know, you could neoclassical, post Keynesian, Austrian, like the biophysical\n\n09:22.400 --> 09:26.760\n economics and so on, other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting.\n\n09:26.760 --> 09:32.080\n OK, I actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago.\n\n09:32.080 --> 09:33.440\n That's where I'd like to start from.\n\n09:33.440 --> 09:35.720\n And they're called the Physiocrats.\n\n09:35.720 --> 09:41.080\n And the name itself implies where the knowledge came from, because if you go back far enough\n\n09:41.080 --> 09:43.760\n in history, we didn't do autopsies.\n\n09:43.760 --> 09:49.480\n But when you started doing autopsies, they found wires, they found tubes, etc., etc.\n\n09:49.480 --> 09:53.280\n And they started seeing the body as a circulation system, and they applied the same sort of\n\n09:53.280 --> 09:55.300\n logic to the economy.\n\n09:55.300 --> 10:00.880\n And they came out of an agricultural economy, which was France, and they saw that the wealth\n\n10:00.880 --> 10:03.140\n came effectively from the sun.\n\n10:03.140 --> 10:06.940\n So their soil wealth comes from, like I said, the soil, but what they really mean is sun.\n\n10:06.940 --> 10:09.200\n The soil absorbs the energy of the sun.\n\n10:09.200 --> 10:12.100\n One seed plants, a thousand flea seeds come back.\n\n10:12.100 --> 10:13.880\n There is no surplus.\n\n10:13.880 --> 10:17.600\n We are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy.\n\n10:17.600 --> 10:20.820\n That's where we should have stayed and developed from that forward.\n\n10:20.820 --> 10:24.920\n We then went through the classical school of economics, which comes out of Adam Smith.\n\n10:24.920 --> 10:31.720\n And Smith, coming from Scotland, looked at what the Physiocrats said, and what the Physiocrats\n\n10:31.720 --> 10:35.920\n argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth, and the manufacturing sector\n\n10:35.920 --> 10:37.240\n is sterile.\n\n10:37.240 --> 10:39.800\n That's literally the term they used to describe the manufacturing sector.\n\n10:39.800 --> 10:40.800\n What does sterile mean?\n\n10:40.800 --> 10:43.920\n Sterile means you don't extract value.\n\n10:43.920 --> 10:46.200\n You simply change the shape of value.\n\n10:46.200 --> 10:49.120\n So the value comes from the soil.\n\n10:49.120 --> 10:51.000\n Yeah, it comes from the soil.\n\n10:51.000 --> 10:52.520\n That's the free gift of nature.\n\n10:52.520 --> 10:54.400\n That's literally the phrase they used.\n\n10:54.400 --> 10:59.300\n And we then distribute the free gift of nature around, and we need carriages, which was the\n\n10:59.300 --> 11:04.360\n manufacturing term they used at the time, as well as wheat.\n\n11:04.360 --> 11:09.400\n So to make the carriages, we take what's been taken from the soil, and we convert it to\n\n11:09.400 --> 11:10.400\n a different form.\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:13.040\n But there is no value added in manufacturing.\n\n11:13.040 --> 11:16.600\n So Smith looked at that and said, well, I'm from Scotland.\n\n11:16.600 --> 11:21.640\n And we've got these industries, and we make stuff, and it's machinery.\n\n11:21.640 --> 11:26.320\n And he said, no, it's not land that gives us the source of value, it's labor.\n\n11:26.320 --> 11:33.080\n Now, that led to the classical school of thought, and that said that all value comes from labor,\n\n11:33.080 --> 11:38.820\n that value is objective, so it's the amount of effort you put in, that the price two things\n\n11:38.820 --> 11:42.920\n will exchange for reflects the relative effort that's involved in the manufacturing.\n\n11:42.920 --> 11:47.120\n So this computer takes two hours to make, and this bottle takes two minutes to make,\n\n11:47.120 --> 11:50.520\n then this is worth 60 times as much as that.\n\n11:50.520 --> 11:53.620\n They didn't talk about marginal cost.\n\n11:53.620 --> 11:55.560\n It was absolute cost, effectively.\n\n11:55.560 --> 12:01.940\n They didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing, they ridiculed subjective utility theory.\n\n12:01.940 --> 12:07.400\n That led to Marx, and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind in the history of economics.\n\n12:07.400 --> 12:12.160\n The only other competitor I'd see is Schumpeter, possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking\n\n12:12.160 --> 12:17.600\n of intellects, it would be Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes, in terms of the outstanding capacities\n\n12:17.600 --> 12:18.680\n to think.\n\n12:18.680 --> 12:24.800\n But Marx then turned that classical school, which was pro capitalism and anti feudal,\n\n12:24.800 --> 12:29.360\n into a critique of capitalism, which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a\n\n12:29.360 --> 12:31.320\n defense of capitalism.\n\n12:31.320 --> 12:36.520\n But they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value, so that value\n\n12:36.520 --> 12:42.580\n does not reflect effort, it's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that\n\n12:42.580 --> 12:45.760\n determines their value, marginal utility.\n\n12:45.760 --> 12:50.040\n It's the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for.\n\n12:50.040 --> 12:56.320\n Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility, and the concepts of equilibrium\n\n12:56.320 --> 13:00.640\n and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school, and that's still\n\n13:00.640 --> 13:04.200\n the dominant school now 150 years later.\n\n13:04.200 --> 13:05.680\n That's the one that everybody learns.\n\n13:05.680 --> 13:09.000\n When you first learn economics, if you don't have the critical background that I managed\n\n13:09.000 --> 13:15.800\n to acquire, that's what you think is economics, the marginal utility, equilibrium oriented\n\n13:15.800 --> 13:20.560\n analysis of mainstream economics, and for example, they ignore money.\n\n13:20.560 --> 13:23.680\n People think economists, you must be an expert on money because you're an economist.\n\n13:23.680 --> 13:27.720\n Well, in fact, economists learn literally in the first few weeks at university that\n\n13:27.720 --> 13:29.520\n money is irrelevant.\n\n13:29.520 --> 13:31.960\n They say money illusion.\n\n13:31.960 --> 13:37.040\n They represent people's tastes using what they call indifference curves, and they're\n\n13:37.040 --> 13:39.240\n like isoquants on a weather map.\n\n13:39.240 --> 13:43.020\n If you look at an isoquant, it shows you all the points of the same pressure.\n\n13:43.020 --> 13:47.520\n So you can be here or you can be in Denver and the air pressure can be the same if you're\n\n13:47.520 --> 13:50.640\n in the same weather unit, so you just draw a cell that links together.\n\n13:50.640 --> 13:55.080\n Well, they do the same thing with utility and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts\n\n13:55.080 --> 14:01.320\n can give you the same utility as lots of coconuts and very few bananas, and you draw basically\n\n14:01.320 --> 14:06.660\n like a hyperbola running down linking the two, and they'll say, well, that's your utility.\n\n14:06.660 --> 14:10.960\n That describes your tastes, and then we have your income, and given your income, you can\n\n14:10.960 --> 14:16.800\n buy that many bananas completely or that many coconuts or a straight line combination of\n\n14:16.800 --> 14:22.320\n the two, and then if we double the nominal price of coconuts and double the nominal price\n\n14:22.320 --> 14:27.920\n of bananas and double your income, what happens, and the correct answer is, oh, nothing, sir.\n\n14:27.920 --> 14:34.120\n You stay at the same point of tangency between what your budget is and which particular utility\n\n14:34.120 --> 14:36.980\n curve gives you the maximum satisfaction.\n\n14:36.980 --> 14:40.100\n So that gets ingrained into them, and they think anybody who worries about money suffers\n\n14:40.100 --> 14:42.480\n from money illusion.\n\n14:42.480 --> 14:48.140\n You are therefore ignorant of the deep insights of economics if you think money actually matters.\n\n14:48.140 --> 14:53.880\n So you have an entire theory of economics which presumes we exchange through barter.\n\n14:53.880 --> 14:58.280\n Like I'll swap you that Microsoft Surface for, actually, I'll take two of those for\n\n14:58.280 --> 14:59.280\n one of these.\n\n14:59.280 --> 15:02.040\n We do this bartering type arrangement.\n\n15:02.040 --> 15:08.160\n In fact, that only works if money plays no creative role in the economy, and that's where\n\n15:08.160 --> 15:13.080\n you find, reading Schumpeter, the insight that's the school of thought that I come from\n\n15:13.080 --> 15:15.260\n that says money is essential.\n\n15:15.260 --> 15:19.140\n Money actually adds to demand, and we'll talk about that later on.\n\n15:19.140 --> 15:28.440\n So that's the neoclassical school that ends up being subjective theory of value, nonmonetary,\n\n15:28.440 --> 15:33.580\n as though everything happens in barter, and focusing on equilibrium, as though everything\n\n15:33.580 --> 15:38.120\n happens in equilibrium, or if you get disturbed from equilibrium, you return back to it again.\n\n15:38.120 --> 15:42.760\n And that mindset describes capitalism.\n\n15:42.760 --> 15:46.040\n Its most interesting feature is that it reaches equilibrium.\n\n15:46.040 --> 15:48.640\n Now what planet are we on to believe that?\n\n15:48.640 --> 15:54.080\n Because if you look at the real world, the real exciting world of capitalism in which\n\n15:54.080 --> 15:59.400\n we live, change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it.\n\n15:59.400 --> 16:00.800\n There's no equilibrium.\n\n16:00.800 --> 16:01.800\n There's no equilibrium.\n\n16:01.800 --> 16:02.800\n It's unstable.\n\n16:02.800 --> 16:07.800\n And as a mathematician, it's easy to \u2013 you work with stability analysis.\n\n16:07.800 --> 16:10.600\n You work out what the Jacobian is.\n\n16:10.600 --> 16:13.920\n You work out your Lyapunov exponents in a complex system.\n\n16:13.920 --> 16:17.160\n You're used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable.\n\n16:17.160 --> 16:21.480\n But economists get schooled into believing that everything happens in equilibrium, and\n\n16:21.480 --> 16:23.360\n they don't learn stability analysis.\n\n16:23.360 --> 16:25.240\n So all that stuff is missing.\n\n16:25.240 --> 16:32.360\n So onto the schools of thought, treating the economy as an equilibrium system, which was\n\n16:32.360 --> 16:36.800\n what the neoclassical school did, is what Keynes disturbed.\n\n16:36.800 --> 16:41.660\n And he really disturbed it by talking about, fundamentally, that uncertainty determines\n\n16:41.660 --> 16:43.600\n our decisions about the future.\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:49.800\n So when we consume, you know if you like Pfizer or whatever particular drink we want to have,\n\n16:49.800 --> 16:51.960\n you know the current situation.\n\n16:51.960 --> 16:55.120\n But to invest, you must be making guesses about the future.\n\n16:55.120 --> 16:56.700\n But you don't know the future.\n\n16:56.700 --> 16:57.740\n So what do you do?\n\n16:57.740 --> 17:00.460\n You extrapolate what you currently know.\n\n17:00.460 --> 17:05.420\n And as you said, this is a terrible basis on which to plan for the future.\n\n17:05.420 --> 17:10.760\n But this is the only thing you can do where there is no possibility of solid calculation.\n\n17:10.760 --> 17:16.880\n So investment is therefore subject to uncertainty, and therefore you will get volatility out\n\n17:16.880 --> 17:17.880\n of investment.\n\n17:17.880 --> 17:22.800\n You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps coming out of that, because people extrapolate\n\n17:22.800 --> 17:24.640\n for the current conditions.\n\n17:24.640 --> 17:27.360\n And that's the normal state of a capitalist economy.\n\n17:27.360 --> 17:32.600\n And Schumpeter argued that that's what gives it its creativity as well, the fact that you\n\n17:32.600 --> 17:37.160\n can perceive a potential demand, but first of all, you don't know whether that demand\n\n17:37.160 --> 17:38.160\n is going to work.\n\n17:38.160 --> 17:41.120\n Secondly, you don't know who your competitor is going to be, whether somebody is going\n\n17:41.120 --> 17:42.760\n to be ahead of you or behind.\n\n17:42.760 --> 17:46.720\n If there's a fad, you'll overinvest.\n\n17:46.720 --> 17:50.440\n All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism, and that's what we're trying to capture,\n\n17:50.440 --> 17:57.080\n the dynamic nonequilibrium monetary violence and creativity of capitalism.\n\n17:57.080 --> 17:58.800\n That's what we should be analyzing.\n\n17:58.800 --> 18:03.800\n And the post Keynesian school has gone in that orientation.\n\n18:03.800 --> 18:09.280\n They've been, in my opinion, inhibited by learning their mathematics from neoclassical\n\n18:09.280 --> 18:12.840\n economists, so they don't have enough of the technology of complex systems.\n\n18:12.840 --> 18:17.680\n There's only a really tiny handful of people working in complex systems analysis in post\n\n18:17.680 --> 18:21.040\n Keynesian economics, but that is, to me, the most interesting area.\n\n18:21.040 --> 18:26.160\n So their tools may be lacking, but they fundamentally accept the instability of things.\n\n18:26.160 --> 18:27.160\n That's right.\n\n18:27.160 --> 18:28.160\n That's right.\n\n18:28.160 --> 18:29.160\n That's interesting.\n\n18:29.160 --> 18:32.520\n So let me try to summarize what you said, and then you say how stupid I am.\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:33.520\n Okay.\n\n18:33.520 --> 18:40.920\n So then there was the physiocrats that thought value came from the land.\n\n18:40.920 --> 18:50.440\n Then there's Adam Smith, who said, nah, value comes from human labor.\n\n18:50.440 --> 18:52.640\n That was the classical school.\n\n18:52.640 --> 19:01.640\n And then neoclassical is value comes from bananas and coconuts, human preferences, like\n\n19:01.640 --> 19:06.320\n human happiness, how happy a banana makes you.\n\n19:06.320 --> 19:13.480\n And then the Keynesian and the post Keynesian were like, yeah, well, you can't, you can\n\n19:13.480 --> 19:19.040\n never, the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut, you're already working\n\n19:19.040 --> 19:21.800\n in the past.\n\n19:21.800 --> 19:24.280\n It's always going to be chaos and stability.\n\n19:24.280 --> 19:29.020\n And then you just, you're fishing in uncertain waters, and that's why we have to embrace\n\n19:29.020 --> 19:32.780\n that and come up with tools that model that well.\n\n19:32.780 --> 19:36.840\n And also Joseph Schumpeter, what school would you put him under?\n\n19:36.840 --> 19:41.000\n Is he a Keynesian or is he Austrian economics?\n\n19:41.000 --> 19:42.000\n He's an Austrian.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:43.000\n The Austrians deny.\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:44.000\n Okay.\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:45.000\n That's the intriguing.\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:51.080\n He's from Austria, but he's not an Austrian economist.\n\n19:51.080 --> 19:54.240\n There are elements of the Austrian school of thought, which are worthwhile.\n\n19:54.240 --> 19:59.080\n What is Austrian economics in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?\n\n19:59.080 --> 20:00.080\n Okay.\n\n20:00.080 --> 20:04.280\n Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion against the classical school.\n\n20:04.280 --> 20:09.440\n So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back\n\n20:09.440 --> 20:10.440\n in the 1870s.\n\n20:10.440 --> 20:17.600\n It was William Jevons from England, Menger, who's from Austria, and Vollras from France.\n\n20:17.600 --> 20:26.400\n And Vollras tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multiproduct economy where there's\n\n20:26.400 --> 20:29.840\n numerous producers and numerous consumers.\n\n20:29.840 --> 20:34.040\n Everybody's both a producer and a consumer, and you try to work out a vector of prices\n\n20:34.040 --> 20:37.720\n that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously.\n\n20:37.720 --> 20:40.360\n And that's his equilibrium orientation.\n\n20:40.360 --> 20:44.040\n Jevons is also one about equilibrium, but he worked more at the aggregate level.\n\n20:44.040 --> 20:48.880\n So there's a supply curve and a demand curve, and that's what Marshall ultimately codified.\n\n20:48.880 --> 20:52.600\n Menger was pretty much saying that, well, yes, there might be an equilibrium, but you're\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:54.480\n going to get disturbed from it all the time.\n\n20:54.480 --> 20:56.080\n You'll be above or below the equilibrium.\n\n20:56.080 --> 21:00.560\n And what came out of the Austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that\n\n21:00.560 --> 21:04.400\n a market should reach equilibrium, but then said, well, you'll get disturbed away from\n\n21:04.400 --> 21:05.720\n the equilibrium.\n\n21:05.720 --> 21:10.960\n And that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism, because an entrepreneur will see\n\n21:10.960 --> 21:15.840\n an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap, and that will give you innovation over\n\n21:15.840 --> 21:16.840\n time.\n\n21:16.840 --> 21:21.240\n And Schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that an entrepreneur\n\n21:21.240 --> 21:25.120\n is somebody with a great idea and no money.\n\n21:25.120 --> 21:28.860\n So to become a capitalist, you've got to get money.\n\n21:28.860 --> 21:32.840\n And therefore, you've got to approach the finance sector to get the money, and the finance\n\n21:32.840 --> 21:37.440\n sector creates money and also creates a debt for the entrepreneur.\n\n21:37.440 --> 21:42.860\n And so you get this financial engine turning up as well, and you will get movements away\n\n21:42.860 --> 21:44.800\n from equilibrium out of that.\n\n21:44.800 --> 21:47.460\n You won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium.\n\n21:47.460 --> 21:54.200\n So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role, in\n\n21:54.200 --> 21:59.200\n which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time.\n\n21:59.200 --> 22:04.240\n And that is really, I think, a much closer vision of actual capitalism than anything\n\n22:04.240 --> 22:13.840\n by even the leading Austrians, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly Rombardo, I find\n\n22:13.840 --> 22:20.840\n totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of The Wealth of Nations.\n\n22:20.840 --> 22:23.680\n I find his work trivial.\n\n22:23.680 --> 22:28.040\n But Schumpeter was rich, but with the same foundations as the Austrians.\n\n22:28.040 --> 22:31.520\n But because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the Austrian\n\n22:31.520 --> 22:36.480\n vision, which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism, Schumpeter said\n\n22:36.480 --> 22:42.700\n you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs.\n\n22:42.700 --> 22:44.880\n And that's a very important vision.\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:48.800\n So Schumpeter's argument is the deviation from equilibrium, that's where all the fun\n\n22:48.800 --> 22:49.800\n happens.\n\n22:49.800 --> 22:50.800\n That's where all the magic happens.\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:51.800\n That's the magic of capitalism.\n\n22:51.800 --> 22:55.160\n And like the Austrians, because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium, they're\n\n22:55.160 --> 23:00.000\n better than their classicals, but they still have this belief in the, you'll reach equilibrium\n\n23:00.000 --> 23:06.160\n ultimately or you'll head back towards it, whereas they don't have an explanation of\n\n23:06.160 --> 23:11.160\n capitalism that gives you cycles apart from having the wrong rate of interest.\n\n23:11.160 --> 23:13.840\n So there's no role for an accumulation of debt over time.\n\n23:13.840 --> 23:20.080\n So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven\n\n23:20.080 --> 23:25.160\n by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector.\n\n23:25.160 --> 23:29.000\n And that's fundamentally the world in which we live.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:36.400\n So there's also the kids these days are all into modern monetary theory, what's that\n\n23:36.400 --> 23:37.400\n about?\n\n23:37.400 --> 23:38.400\n Okay.\n\n23:38.400 --> 23:39.400\n Modern monetary theory is accounting.\n\n23:39.400 --> 23:42.280\n I want to summarize it bluntly.\n\n23:42.280 --> 23:46.600\n It's simply saying let's do the accounting because what money is, is a creature of double\n\n23:46.600 --> 23:47.600\n entry bookkeeping.\n\n23:47.600 --> 23:48.600\n Okay.\n\n23:48.600 --> 23:50.600\n What's double entry bookkeeping?\n\n23:50.600 --> 23:53.080\n This was invented back in the 1500s in Italy.\n\n23:53.080 --> 23:57.920\n I've forgotten the particular merchant who did it based on some Arabic ideas as well.\n\n23:57.920 --> 24:06.480\n But the thing is, if you want to keep track of your financial flows, then you divide all\n\n24:06.480 --> 24:08.280\n the financial claims on you.\n\n24:08.280 --> 24:12.200\n You divide into claims you have on somebody else, which are your assets, claims somebody\n\n24:12.200 --> 24:17.200\n else has on you, which are your liabilities, and the gap between the two is your equity.\n\n24:17.200 --> 24:20.200\n So you record every transaction twice on one row.\n\n24:20.200 --> 24:21.200\n Okay.\n\n24:21.200 --> 24:26.440\n So for example, if you and I do a financial transfer, you have a bank account, I have\n\n24:26.440 --> 24:30.480\n a bank account, your bank account will go down, mine goes up.\n\n24:30.480 --> 24:31.480\n Okay.\n\n24:31.480 --> 24:34.200\n And that's the sum of the operation is zero.\n\n24:34.200 --> 24:35.200\n Okay.\n\n24:35.200 --> 24:38.440\n But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money, then my account goes up, they\n\n24:38.440 --> 24:41.600\n put money in my deposit account, the bank's assets go up.\n\n24:41.600 --> 24:42.600\n Okay.\n\n24:42.600 --> 24:47.000\n And there's still the same sum applies, assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero.\n\n24:47.000 --> 24:51.960\n Now that's simply saying money is an accounting, a creature of accounting.\n\n24:51.960 --> 24:54.000\n It's not a creature of a commodity.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:58.000\n So if you think about how Austrians think about money, and how gold bugs think about\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:02.980\n money and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left, think about money, what they see\n\n25:02.980 --> 25:04.600\n is money is an object.\n\n25:04.600 --> 25:05.600\n Okay.\n\n25:05.600 --> 25:11.840\n And you and I can both have more gold, if we're both willing to go to this mine somewhere\n\n25:11.840 --> 25:14.820\n and dig a few holes and get a few specks of gold out.\n\n25:14.820 --> 25:20.420\n So there's no competition or no interaction between you and me if money is gold.\n\n25:20.420 --> 25:23.140\n And they think money should be an object, a commodity.\n\n25:23.140 --> 25:25.800\n But money fundamentally is not a commodity.\n\n25:25.800 --> 25:28.260\n It's a claim on somebody else.\n\n25:28.260 --> 25:29.640\n That's money's essence.\n\n25:29.640 --> 25:32.660\n So when you do it, you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it.\n\n25:32.660 --> 25:36.200\n And then when you do, you find all the answers that come out of thinking of money as a commodity\n\n25:36.200 --> 25:37.480\n are wrong.\n\n25:37.480 --> 25:39.300\n So for example, and I've got Elon on this one.\n\n25:39.300 --> 25:43.000\n So I want to get this with Elon because I saw him making a comment about this a few\n\n25:43.000 --> 25:44.420\n weeks ago on Twitter.\n\n25:44.420 --> 25:47.380\n He said that it's wrong for the government, effectively it seems wrong for the government\n\n25:47.380 --> 25:48.960\n to always be in deficit.\n\n25:48.960 --> 25:49.960\n Okay.\n\n25:49.960 --> 25:54.440\n Now, when you look at it and say, well, how is money created?\n\n25:54.440 --> 25:59.460\n How does money come about when it's not a commodity like gold, which you dig up out\n\n25:59.460 --> 26:03.960\n of the ground, when it's actually social relations between people that create money?\n\n26:03.960 --> 26:11.400\n Well, money is the fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector.\n\n26:11.400 --> 26:17.360\n If we make a transfer between us, your deposit account goes down, my deposit account goes\n\n26:17.360 --> 26:18.560\n up.\n\n26:18.560 --> 26:23.640\n Deposit exchange is on the liability side of the banking sector.\n\n26:23.640 --> 26:28.400\n But if we have a transaction with a bank, then if the bank lends us money, as its loans\n\n26:28.400 --> 26:32.100\n go up, its deposits go up, again, that same balance.\n\n26:32.100 --> 26:36.680\n So you've got to look and say, money therefore is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking\n\n26:36.680 --> 26:37.760\n sector.\n\n26:37.760 --> 26:40.480\n So how do you create additional liabilities?\n\n26:40.480 --> 26:45.760\n You must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side and the asset side of\n\n26:45.760 --> 26:46.920\n the banking sector.\n\n26:46.920 --> 26:51.840\n So if you and I make a new transaction, no money is created.\n\n26:51.840 --> 26:53.520\n Existing money is redistributed.\n\n26:53.520 --> 26:58.400\n But if you go to a bank and take out a bank loan, then money is created by the bank loan.\n\n26:58.400 --> 27:02.480\n So the liabilities of the banking sector rise, the assets rise, they're balanced, but more\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:06.080\n liabilities of the banking sector means more money.\n\n27:06.080 --> 27:08.840\n So that's how private banks create money.\n\n27:08.840 --> 27:15.000\n And that's what I first started working on when I became an academic about 35 years ago,\n\n27:15.000 --> 27:17.040\n the actual dynamics of private money creation.\n\n27:17.040 --> 27:19.540\n But the government has the same sort of story.\n\n27:19.540 --> 27:26.560\n If the government runs a deficit, it spends more money on the individuals in the economy\n\n27:26.560 --> 27:31.440\n than it taxes them, which means their bank accounts increase.\n\n27:31.440 --> 27:36.860\n So a government deficit creates money for the private sector.\n\n27:36.860 --> 27:39.320\n So that's where money creation occurs from the government.\n\n27:39.320 --> 27:47.240\n So it puts more money into people's bank accounts by spending, by welfare payments than it takes\n\n27:47.240 --> 27:49.080\n out by taxation.\n\n27:49.080 --> 27:50.920\n So that's creating new money.\n\n27:50.920 --> 27:55.800\n And then on the other side on the bank, the money turns up in the reserve accounts of\n\n27:55.800 --> 28:00.480\n the banks, which are basically the private bank's bank accounts at the central bank.\n\n28:00.480 --> 28:06.780\n So rather than the asset of private money creation being loans, the asset of government\n\n28:06.780 --> 28:09.880\n money creation is reserves.\n\n28:09.880 --> 28:11.360\n Okay?\n\n28:11.360 --> 28:12.360\n Right.\n\n28:12.360 --> 28:13.360\n Money creation.\n\n28:13.360 --> 28:14.360\n Money creation.\n\n28:14.360 --> 28:15.360\n It's a good thing.\n\n28:15.360 --> 28:19.200\n So you mentioned a bunch of stuff like private money creation with the liabilities in the\n\n28:19.200 --> 28:24.120\n banks and then how the government is doing, the reserves, blah, blah, blah.\n\n28:24.120 --> 28:29.120\n At the end of the day, there's a bunch of printers that are printing money.\n\n28:29.120 --> 28:33.680\n And then you also said something interesting, which is social relations between humans is\n\n28:33.680 --> 28:35.480\n what creates money.\n\n28:35.480 --> 28:40.440\n I think my mind was blown several times over the past minute.\n\n28:40.440 --> 28:44.720\n So it's difficult for me to reconstruct the pieces of my mind back together.\n\n28:44.720 --> 28:50.920\n But basic question, is money creation a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n28:50.920 --> 28:56.840\n Money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen.\n\n28:56.840 --> 28:58.320\n Isn't there a conservation of...\n\n28:58.320 --> 28:59.320\n No, there isn't.\n\n28:59.320 --> 29:03.160\n I had to have arguments with physicists over this and it took me a long time to answer\n\n29:03.160 --> 29:04.160\n it.\n\n29:04.160 --> 29:05.840\n So the sum total of all money is zero.\n\n29:05.840 --> 29:06.840\n Yeah.\n\n29:06.840 --> 29:07.840\n Okay.\n\n29:07.840 --> 29:10.720\n It's the sum total of all assets and liabilities is zero.\n\n29:10.720 --> 29:18.040\n So if you imagine your assets minus your liabilities is your equity and your asset is somebody\n\n29:18.040 --> 29:21.720\n else's liability and your liability is somebody else's asset.\n\n29:21.720 --> 29:24.960\n When we're talking about financial assets, and this is another mind blowing thing that\n\n29:24.960 --> 29:27.920\n I've just recently solved myself.\n\n29:27.920 --> 29:31.840\n So the sum total of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:32.840\n Okay.\n\n29:32.840 --> 29:33.840\n Wait, wait, wait.\n\n29:33.840 --> 29:36.000\n I'm sorry to interrupt you rudely.\n\n29:36.000 --> 29:37.300\n What are assets?\n\n29:37.300 --> 29:38.480\n What are liabilities?\n\n29:38.480 --> 29:41.120\n Assets are your claims on somebody else.\n\n29:41.120 --> 29:42.120\n So...\n\n29:42.120 --> 29:43.120\n Specific.\n\n29:43.120 --> 29:44.680\n Give me an example of an asset.\n\n29:44.680 --> 29:45.680\n Okay.\n\n29:45.680 --> 29:46.680\n Do you have a mortgage for this house?\n\n29:46.680 --> 29:47.680\n No.\n\n29:47.680 --> 29:48.680\n I'm renting.\n\n29:48.680 --> 29:49.680\n You're renting.\n\n29:49.680 --> 29:50.680\n There you go.\n\n29:50.680 --> 29:51.680\n Well, if you had a mortgage, that'd be your liability.\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:53.160\n That would be my liability.\n\n29:53.160 --> 29:54.160\n Okay.\n\n29:54.160 --> 29:55.400\n The mortgage with the bank's asset.\n\n29:55.400 --> 29:56.400\n Right.\n\n29:56.400 --> 29:57.400\n Okay.\n\n29:57.400 --> 29:58.400\n If you add the two together, you get zero.\n\n29:58.400 --> 29:59.400\n Okay.\n\n29:59.400 --> 30:00.400\n So that's zero.\n\n30:00.400 --> 30:01.400\n That's zero.\n\n30:01.400 --> 30:04.360\n So money is the liabilities side of the banking sector.\n\n30:04.360 --> 30:05.360\n Okay.\n\n30:05.360 --> 30:06.360\n Okay.\n\n30:06.360 --> 30:08.480\n Assets are the...\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:12.200\n The assets on the other side can be either created by the banking sector, which is where\n\n30:12.200 --> 30:16.640\n you get bank loans, or created by the government, where you get reserves.\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:18.120\n But money is the liabilities.\n\n30:18.120 --> 30:19.120\n Money is...\n\n30:19.120 --> 30:23.800\n If you think about protons and anti protons, in that sense, money is like the anti proton.\n\n30:23.800 --> 30:25.760\n It's the negative, the liability.\n\n30:25.760 --> 30:27.600\n But wait, wait, wait.\n\n30:27.600 --> 30:30.960\n The liability is the negative.\n\n30:30.960 --> 30:31.960\n Yeah.\n\n30:31.960 --> 30:32.960\n How's that money?\n\n30:32.960 --> 30:33.960\n I thought money is the positive.\n\n30:33.960 --> 30:37.880\n What is the liability for the banking sector is an asset for you and me.\n\n30:37.880 --> 30:39.720\n And assets includes money?\n\n30:39.720 --> 30:40.720\n Yeah.\n\n30:40.720 --> 30:41.720\n Yeah.\n\n30:41.720 --> 30:42.720\n Okay.\n\n30:42.720 --> 30:45.520\n If you have a bank account, you'd have a bank account, and you'd have some cash.\n\n30:45.520 --> 30:46.520\n Yeah.\n\n30:46.520 --> 30:47.520\n Okay.\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:48.520\n Those are your assets.\n\n30:48.520 --> 30:53.560\n But the bank account is a liability of the banking sector, and the cash is a liability\n\n30:53.560 --> 30:55.040\n of the Federal Reserve.\n\n30:55.040 --> 30:56.040\n Okay.\n\n30:56.040 --> 30:57.040\n So what's money?\n\n30:57.040 --> 31:04.280\n Well, money is the promise of a third party that we both accept to close our transaction.\n\n31:04.280 --> 31:05.280\n And this is...\n\n31:05.280 --> 31:06.280\n And that's a bank with a liability?\n\n31:06.280 --> 31:07.280\n That's a bank.\n\n31:07.280 --> 31:08.280\n Yeah.\n\n31:08.280 --> 31:12.120\n One of the most important works I've ever read is a work by a wonderful, now unfortunately\n\n31:12.120 --> 31:18.000\n deceased, Italian economist called Augusto Graziani.\n\n31:18.000 --> 31:20.120\n And he's the most wonderful personality.\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:26.160\n Augusto, I met him on a few occasions, is one of the few human beings who can speak\n\n31:26.160 --> 31:31.260\n in perfectly formed paragraphs, okay, superbly eloquent.\n\n31:31.260 --> 31:36.060\n And what he did was write a paper called The Monetary Theory of Production.\n\n31:36.060 --> 31:41.640\n You can find it, download it on the web, it's pretty much open source now.\n\n31:41.640 --> 31:45.400\n And what he said is, what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy?\n\n31:45.400 --> 31:50.840\n So he said, in a barter economy, what we do is, you know, I'll give you two of these for\n\n31:50.840 --> 31:51.840\n one of those.\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:52.840\n Yeah.\n\n31:52.840 --> 31:53.840\n Okay, barter.\n\n31:53.840 --> 31:57.600\n So we've got a relative price, there are two of us involved, and there are two commodities.\n\n31:57.600 --> 32:02.440\n So with money, money is a triangular transaction, okay?\n\n32:02.440 --> 32:08.640\n There is one commodity, I want to buy that can of drink off you, two people, and the\n\n32:08.640 --> 32:14.540\n price that's worked out ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the bank\n\n32:14.540 --> 32:19.240\n that the buyer has to the promises to pay the bank that the seller has.\n\n32:19.240 --> 32:26.380\n So if I, so what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy involves three agents,\n\n32:26.380 --> 32:28.160\n the buyer, the seller, and the bank.\n\n32:28.160 --> 32:29.960\n So the bank always has to be part of it.\n\n32:29.960 --> 32:32.160\n Well, the bank has to be part of it.\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:37.600\n When I hand you the money, you accept that as you've now got, rather than it's the bank\n\n32:37.600 --> 32:41.320\n promising to pay me something, it's now the bank promising to pay you something.\n\n32:41.320 --> 32:46.040\n And we exchange the promises of banks, and that's fundamentally money.\n\n32:46.040 --> 32:51.440\n So money is fundamentally a threesome, and everybody gets fucked.\n\n32:51.440 --> 32:53.200\n Is that a good way to put it?\n\n32:53.200 --> 32:54.200\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n32:54.200 --> 32:57.520\n It leaves it, it leaves it for the guy to be like, oh no, I can use French in this conversation,\n\n32:57.520 --> 32:58.520\n that's good.\n\n32:58.520 --> 33:03.560\n That's not French, that's a different language, I'll explain it to you one day.\n\n33:03.560 --> 33:05.800\n You Australians will never understand.\n\n33:05.800 --> 33:09.360\n Okay, if I can return to, we'll jump around if it's okay.\n\n33:09.360 --> 33:10.360\n Oh, that's fine.\n\n33:10.360 --> 33:18.800\n So you mentioned Karl Marx as one of the great intellects, economic thinkers ever.\n\n33:18.800 --> 33:21.040\n He might be number one.\n\n33:21.040 --> 33:26.080\n You study him quite a bit, you disagree with him quite a bit, but you still think he's\n\n33:26.080 --> 33:28.040\n a powerful thinker.\n\n33:28.040 --> 33:29.040\n A powerful mind.\n\n33:29.040 --> 33:30.480\n A powerful mind.\n\n33:30.480 --> 33:36.720\n So first of all, let's just explore the human.\n\n33:36.720 --> 33:38.060\n Why do you say so?\n\n33:38.060 --> 33:40.100\n What's interesting in that mind?\n\n33:40.100 --> 33:45.520\n In the way he saw the world, what are the insights that you find brilliant?\n\n33:45.520 --> 33:54.360\n Marx once described his major work as, towards a critical examination of everything existing.\n\n33:54.360 --> 33:56.180\n So he's a modest bastard.\n\n33:56.180 --> 34:00.040\n So he wanted to understand and criticize everything.\n\n34:00.040 --> 34:08.240\n And even, he wasn't trained directly by Hegel, but his teachers were Hegelian philosophers.\n\n34:08.240 --> 34:12.760\n And what Hegel developed was a concept called dialectics.\n\n34:12.760 --> 34:15.580\n And dialectics is the philosophy of change.\n\n34:15.580 --> 34:21.520\n And when most people hear the word dialectics, they come up with this unpronounceable trio\n\n34:21.520 --> 34:25.760\n of words called thesis, antithesis, synthesis.\n\n34:25.760 --> 34:28.040\n I can barely get the words out myself.\n\n34:28.040 --> 34:29.480\n And that actually is not Hegel at all.\n\n34:29.480 --> 34:30.480\n That's another German philosopher.\n\n34:30.480 --> 34:31.480\n Kant?\n\n34:31.480 --> 34:32.480\n Fichte.\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:33.480\n Oh, I thought it was Kant.\n\n34:33.480 --> 34:34.480\n No, Fichte.\n\n34:34.480 --> 34:35.480\n Well, I'm not sure.\n\n34:35.480 --> 34:36.480\n I mix them up.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:37.480\n All Germans look the same to me.\n\n34:37.480 --> 34:38.480\n Yeah.\n\n34:38.480 --> 34:39.480\n Yeah.\n\n34:39.480 --> 34:42.760\n So, but if you look, there's a beautiful book called Marx and Contradiction.\n\n34:42.760 --> 34:45.720\n You want to find a great explanation for Marx's philosophy.\n\n34:45.720 --> 34:46.720\n I've forgotten the author.\n\n34:46.720 --> 34:50.960\n I think it's Wild, W I L D E, Marx and Contradiction.\n\n34:50.960 --> 34:55.120\n And he points out the actual origins of Marx's philosophy, but I didn't know that when I\n\n34:55.120 --> 34:56.120\n first read Marx.\n\n34:56.120 --> 35:01.500\n So I became exposed to Marx when I was a student at Sydney University.\n\n35:01.500 --> 35:06.840\n And we'd had a strike at the university over the teaching of philosophy.\n\n35:06.840 --> 35:11.320\n And what happened was the philosophy department had a lot of radical philosophers in it and\n\n35:11.320 --> 35:14.000\n a conservative chief philosopher.\n\n35:14.000 --> 35:21.040\n And the radicals wanted to have a course on what they called philosophical aspects of\n\n35:21.040 --> 35:22.740\n feminist thought.\n\n35:22.740 --> 35:24.280\n And the staff voted in favor of it.\n\n35:24.280 --> 35:27.640\n This is back in the days when university departments were democratic.\n\n35:27.640 --> 35:29.040\n The professor opposed it.\n\n35:29.040 --> 35:30.280\n He got it blocked at a high level.\n\n35:30.280 --> 35:34.600\n The staff lipfrogged over that, and then finally the vice chancellor blocked it.\n\n35:34.600 --> 35:39.480\n So that led to a strike over the teaching of philosophy at Sydney University, which\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:45.040\n at one stage, over half the students were on strike.\n\n35:45.040 --> 35:46.040\n Economics began out of that.\n\n35:46.040 --> 35:48.680\n Over teaching of a philosophy of feminism.\n\n35:48.680 --> 35:49.680\n Yes.\n\n35:49.680 --> 35:50.680\n God, it's good to be a student.\n\n35:50.680 --> 35:53.260\n That's such a different life to what we're living now.\n\n35:53.260 --> 35:58.720\n That's the academic milieu in which I developed all my ideas.\n\n35:58.720 --> 35:59.840\n And I had become a critic.\n\n35:59.840 --> 36:03.740\n I've gone from being a believer of mainstream economics when I was a first year student\n\n36:03.740 --> 36:06.680\n to disbelieving it halfway through first year.\n\n36:06.680 --> 36:07.680\n Okay.\n\n36:07.680 --> 36:11.280\n And I then spent a long time trying to change it, getting nowhere.\n\n36:11.280 --> 36:15.500\n And then this philosophy strike happened and we took it on in economics and we formed what's\n\n36:15.500 --> 36:19.860\n called the political economy movement and had a successful strike.\n\n36:19.860 --> 36:25.520\n We actually managed to pressure the university into establishing a department of political\n\n36:25.520 --> 36:28.760\n economy at Sydney University, as well as a department of economics.\n\n36:28.760 --> 36:30.720\n What was the foundational ideas?\n\n36:30.720 --> 36:37.120\n Were you resistant to the whole censorship of why can't you have a philosophy of anything\n\n36:37.120 --> 36:38.120\n kind of course?\n\n36:38.120 --> 36:44.560\n Well, it was much more libertarian in the genuine sense of the word, period of time,\n\n36:44.560 --> 36:49.600\n at the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s than the word libertarian has been corrupted\n\n36:49.600 --> 36:50.600\n since then.\n\n36:50.600 --> 36:52.500\n But it really was about free thought.\n\n36:52.500 --> 36:54.060\n And you went to university to learn.\n\n36:54.060 --> 36:55.060\n It was about education.\n\n36:55.060 --> 36:59.240\n I remember having a fight with my father once where dad was angry about the marks I was\n\n36:59.240 --> 37:01.120\n getting for some of my courses.\n\n37:01.120 --> 37:04.280\n And he said, if you don't get a decent result, you won't get a decent job.\n\n37:04.280 --> 37:05.440\n And I said, I'm not here to get a job.\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:06.440\n I'm here to get an education.\n\n37:06.440 --> 37:07.440\n Oh, wow.\n\n37:07.440 --> 37:08.440\n Okay.\n\n37:08.440 --> 37:11.480\n Now, the thing is, ultimately, it's been a pretty good job for me as well.\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:16.160\n This is in Sydney, by the way, and Sydney in summer is absolutely gorgeous.\n\n37:16.160 --> 37:20.320\n And what does a bunch of lefties decide to do during summer but read Karl Marx?\n\n37:20.320 --> 37:21.320\n Yeah.\n\n37:21.320 --> 37:22.320\n On the beach or?\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:27.480\n Actually, inside the room of the philosophy department at the University of Sydney in\n\n37:27.480 --> 37:28.480\n the main quadrangle.\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:32.840\n There's sandstone all around us, and we have a bunch of about 20 or 30 of us reading our\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:33.840\n way through Marx.\n\n37:33.840 --> 37:34.840\n Capital?\n\n37:34.840 --> 37:35.840\n Which capital?\n\n37:35.840 --> 37:38.540\n It was volume one capital.\n\n37:38.540 --> 37:46.000\n And I remember walking off to that meeting with one of my friends who's a law student.\n\n37:46.000 --> 37:51.240\n And this was a period of a huge construction boom in Sydney, so the whole skyline, which\n\n37:51.240 --> 37:55.200\n we could see from the campus, was full of what they call kangaroo cranes, which were\n\n37:55.200 --> 37:59.640\n an Australian invention, that are cranes that can be leapfrogged over each other to build\n\n37:59.640 --> 38:00.640\n a skyscraper.\n\n38:00.640 --> 38:05.840\n So, here you are reading Karl Marx, looking at the mechanisms of capital.\n\n38:05.840 --> 38:09.720\n And I looked at those mechanisms, and I knew Marx argued that labor was the only source\n\n38:09.720 --> 38:10.720\n of value.\n\n38:10.720 --> 38:11.720\n Yeah.\n\n38:11.720 --> 38:12.720\n And he said machinery doesn't add value.\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:14.760\n So, the cranes are worthless.\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:18.120\n I'm looking at these cranes and thinking, I want a very good explanation by Marx as\n\n38:18.120 --> 38:20.080\n to why these cranes don't add value.\n\n38:20.080 --> 38:24.680\n So, reading through the first seven chapters of Capital, what you found was Marx applying\n\n38:24.680 --> 38:26.200\n this dialectic.\n\n38:26.200 --> 38:28.040\n And like the Fichte and stuff is bullshit.\n\n38:28.040 --> 38:29.560\n That is not how Marx thought at all.\n\n38:29.560 --> 38:34.040\n I was reading, trying to find the thesis and the synthesis, and it's not there at all in\n\n38:34.040 --> 38:35.040\n any of Marx's works.\n\n38:35.040 --> 38:42.600\n And I've read everything he's ever written on economics from 1844 to 1894, when his last\n\n38:42.600 --> 38:44.080\n books were published.\n\n38:44.080 --> 38:45.440\n There's not one word of mention of that.\n\n38:45.440 --> 38:49.480\n What he does talk about is foreground and background and tension.\n\n38:49.480 --> 38:57.720\n And his idea of a dialectic is that a unity will exist in society, and that unity can\n\n38:57.720 --> 39:01.200\n be individual, it can be a commodity, anything at all.\n\n39:01.200 --> 39:05.440\n The unity will be understood by that society.\n\n39:05.440 --> 39:07.200\n One particular aspect will be focused upon.\n\n39:07.200 --> 39:12.240\n So, if you think about the human being in capitalism, the focus on the human being as\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:14.840\n an object is their capacity to work.\n\n39:14.840 --> 39:17.120\n You're a worker, okay?\n\n39:17.120 --> 39:19.800\n It's put in the foreground.\n\n39:19.800 --> 39:23.280\n The fact that you're human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love\n\n39:23.280 --> 39:27.360\n and all the other things that humans do is pushed into the background.\n\n39:27.360 --> 39:30.400\n There's a tension between the two of those.\n\n39:30.400 --> 39:33.320\n And that can transform that unity over time.\n\n39:33.320 --> 39:37.640\n And that's a beautiful dynamic vision of change.\n\n39:37.640 --> 39:40.040\n So dialectics is a philosophy of change.\n\n39:40.040 --> 39:45.800\n So synthesis, antithesis is what does every idea have a counter argument?\n\n39:45.800 --> 39:46.800\n Yeah.\n\n39:46.800 --> 39:48.760\n There's a positive and negative and you bring them together somehow.\n\n39:48.760 --> 39:52.440\n And then Marx has this foreground, background, and tension.\n\n39:52.440 --> 39:56.940\n Foreground is all what we think of as economics and background is all the lovemaking we do\n\n39:56.940 --> 39:57.940\n as humans.\n\n39:57.940 --> 39:58.940\n That sort of thing.\n\n39:58.940 --> 40:01.360\n And why is there a tension?\n\n40:01.360 --> 40:07.520\n Because if you imagine the unity, like if you take a human in a, any preview, like\n\n40:07.520 --> 40:12.560\n if you go back to Cro Magnum days, when we're living in caves and we've got to go hunting\n\n40:12.560 --> 40:16.760\n and cook food and stuff like that, but there's no social hierarchy.\n\n40:16.760 --> 40:20.480\n Because we've become used to, so you don't get labored as a worker or a capitalist.\n\n40:20.480 --> 40:22.740\n You're just a human in that situation.\n\n40:22.740 --> 40:26.360\n Then you've got more an integrated view of who you are.\n\n40:26.360 --> 40:30.360\n And I think that's one of the appeals of a tribal, a genuine tribal culture that you\n\n40:30.360 --> 40:32.520\n get treated for the whole of who you are.\n\n40:32.520 --> 40:36.340\n You've certainly categorized you're male, you're female, you're young, you're old,\n\n40:36.340 --> 40:39.440\n you're a hunter, you're a tool maker, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n40:39.440 --> 40:41.740\n But you're treated as more an integrated object.\n\n40:41.740 --> 40:47.040\n When you get put in a complex society, like a capitalist society, then one side of you's\n\n40:47.040 --> 40:48.960\n emphasized and the others are deemphasized.\n\n40:48.960 --> 40:54.520\n So is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity and the\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:56.840\n foreground is the machine of capitalism?\n\n40:56.840 --> 40:57.840\n Effectively.\n\n40:57.840 --> 41:01.960\n And when you look at it in terms of a human, but what Marx did is apply this to a commodity.\n\n41:01.960 --> 41:05.760\n So he said, what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy?\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:08.360\n And the essential unity is a commodity.\n\n41:08.360 --> 41:10.440\n The essential unit.\n\n41:10.440 --> 41:12.120\n The essential unity.\n\n41:12.120 --> 41:13.120\n What's unity?\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:15.040\n Unity is an object in society.\n\n41:15.040 --> 41:16.040\n Okay.\n\n41:16.040 --> 41:17.040\n Okay.\n\n41:17.040 --> 41:20.260\n So he started from the point of view of trying to understand how exchange occurs.\n\n41:20.260 --> 41:21.800\n How do we set prices?\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:28.720\n And his starting vision was to say that a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy.\n\n41:28.720 --> 41:35.280\n The part of the unity that we focus upon is the exchange value.\n\n41:35.280 --> 41:41.200\n A capitalist produces a commodity, not because of its qualitative characteristics, but because\n\n41:41.200 --> 41:43.080\n it'd be sold for a profit.\n\n41:43.080 --> 41:47.040\n So the foreground aspect of a commodity is its exchange value.\n\n41:47.040 --> 41:52.720\n The background aspect of it, it won't succeed as a commodity unless it has a use value.\n\n41:52.720 --> 41:55.280\n So the background is the utility thing.\n\n41:55.280 --> 41:56.280\n Yeah.\n\n41:56.280 --> 42:01.800\n See, if you made something which didn't work, okay, then you might be able to sell it, but\n\n42:01.800 --> 42:02.800\n it has no utility.\n\n42:02.800 --> 42:05.360\n You can't make that into a commodity.\n\n42:05.360 --> 42:06.360\n A broken thing can't be sold.\n\n42:06.360 --> 42:07.360\n Does that have the subjective?\n\n42:07.360 --> 42:12.200\n Yeah, it has to have the subjective side as well as the objective.\n\n42:12.200 --> 42:14.000\n So the objective is what capitalists worry about.\n\n42:14.000 --> 42:16.200\n I'll give you my favorite counter example of that.\n\n42:16.200 --> 42:21.060\n I took a bunch of Australian journalists to China way back in the period when the Gang\n\n42:21.060 --> 42:28.360\n of Four was being on trial, and we did a tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing.\n\n42:28.360 --> 42:33.240\n And at that stage, all the artifacts of the royal family, the emperor, were actually in\n\n42:33.240 --> 42:34.240\n the building still.\n\n42:34.240 --> 42:41.160\n And we walked past one of them, and it was this gold, solid gold bar about this long,\n\n42:41.160 --> 42:43.080\n shaped like a fist, turned over like this.\n\n42:43.080 --> 42:46.480\n And on this side, there were rubies, emeralds, diamonds.\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:47.480\n You'd never seen gemstones.\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:49.900\n I mean, gems that big, okay?\n\n42:49.900 --> 42:52.720\n And one of the journalists asked me what I thought it was, and I said, oh, it's obvious.\n\n42:52.720 --> 42:55.280\n Jane is a backscratcher, ha, ha, ha.\n\n42:55.280 --> 42:56.280\n I walked away.\n\n42:56.280 --> 43:01.480\n She caught up with me about 20 minutes later, said, I asked one of the guides, it is a backscratcher.\n\n43:01.480 --> 43:06.040\n So here's a backscratcher for the emperor made of solid gold with diamonds and rubies\n\n43:06.040 --> 43:07.720\n and emeralds during the scratching.\n\n43:07.720 --> 43:11.080\n Now, that's a commodity in a feudal society, okay?\n\n43:11.080 --> 43:13.380\n The cost doesn't matter.\n\n43:13.380 --> 43:16.880\n You want the most elaborate, beautiful thing because you are the emperor.\n\n43:16.880 --> 43:22.720\n So in a feudal society, the commodity, what's focused upon is the utility.\n\n43:22.720 --> 43:26.520\n And the cost of production when you're the emperor is immaterial.\n\n43:26.520 --> 43:28.240\n Capitalism reverses that.\n\n43:28.240 --> 43:33.020\n So the commodity in a capitalist economy is a plastic $2.00 scratchy you can get from\n\n43:33.020 --> 43:35.840\n Kmart or Target.\n\n43:35.840 --> 43:42.400\n And so the use value is necessary but irrelevant to forming the price.\n\n43:42.400 --> 43:47.600\n Now, that was a completely different vision of exchange in capitalism to what I found\n\n43:47.600 --> 43:52.440\n in the neoclassical theory because that says it's the marginal utility and the marginal\n\n43:52.440 --> 43:57.040\n cost of everything that determines the exchange ratio.\n\n43:57.040 --> 44:02.640\n And the crazy thing about that is not so much the marginal utility, but the argument in\n\n44:02.640 --> 44:07.480\n the neoclassical theory is that the price ratio, the price will, when there's an exchange\n\n44:07.480 --> 44:16.440\n going on, there's two person, two commodity exchange of two commodities between two people.\n\n44:16.440 --> 44:21.360\n The price will change until such time as the ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to\n\n44:21.360 --> 44:25.320\n the ratio of the marginal costs that's supposed to be the equilibrium.\n\n44:25.320 --> 44:27.160\n And Marx says that's bullshit.\n\n44:27.160 --> 44:33.040\n That's a previous society where you exchange stuff that you happen to have for stuff somebody\n\n44:33.040 --> 44:37.400\n else happened to have without any real production mechanism being involved.\n\n44:37.400 --> 44:42.400\n And he said that's like when you have two ancient tribes meeting for the very first\n\n44:42.400 --> 44:46.720\n time and one tribe can make something the other tribe can't make.\n\n44:46.720 --> 44:52.080\n And they will therefore, the price they were willing to pay will reflect how unique this\n\n44:52.080 --> 44:55.480\n other object is that this one tribe can make and the other can't.\n\n44:55.480 --> 45:00.600\n So for example, the story of Manhattan being sold for 40 glass beads, it's actually 40\n\n45:00.600 --> 45:03.960\n glass trading beads, I believe it is a true story.\n\n45:03.960 --> 45:07.680\n But the thing is the Indians couldn't make glass beads.\n\n45:07.680 --> 45:12.360\n So they valued the glass beads at the island of Manhattan, okay, which is a utility based\n\n45:12.360 --> 45:13.360\n comparison.\n\n45:13.360 --> 45:17.560\n And what Marx said, that's the very initial contact over time, even if you don't know\n\n45:17.560 --> 45:18.560\n the technology.\n\n45:18.560 --> 45:23.800\n Over time, you start to realize how much work goes involved to making what they're selling\n\n45:23.800 --> 45:26.680\n you versus what you're selling to them.\n\n45:26.680 --> 45:29.920\n And you start making stuff specifically for sale.\n\n45:29.920 --> 45:37.080\n So you know, Elon's not losing personal utility each time a Model 3 goes out the door.\n\n45:37.080 --> 45:41.360\n He might get utility out of the fact that he's created that vehicle, that concept and\n\n45:41.360 --> 45:45.460\n manufactures it and so on, but he's not losing utility each time a Model T Ford goes out\n\n45:45.460 --> 45:50.360\n the door, going back for the ancient commodity there.\n\n45:50.360 --> 45:56.440\n So the utility plays no role in setting price in Marx's model.\n\n45:56.440 --> 45:59.200\n Whereas it's essential in the neoclassical model.\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:02.000\n What's the difference between utility and marginal utility?\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.720\n What does the word marginal mean?\n\n46:04.720 --> 46:06.380\n And why is it such a problem?\n\n46:06.380 --> 46:11.640\n It turns marginal utility or utility itself has different meanings than the two schools\n\n46:11.640 --> 46:12.640\n of thought.\n\n46:12.640 --> 46:17.240\n If you take the classical school of thought, which when Marx comes from, utility is effectively\n\n46:17.240 --> 46:18.240\n objective.\n\n46:18.240 --> 46:22.680\n So the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it, okay, not how comfortable it makes\n\n46:22.680 --> 46:23.680\n you feel.\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:27.240\n Okay, now if you think about the utility of the chairs, we're both sitting and they're\n\n46:27.240 --> 46:30.760\n identical from a classical point of view, we're both sitting.\n\n46:30.760 --> 46:34.600\n But from a neoclassical point of view, it's how comfortable it makes you feel.\n\n46:34.600 --> 46:37.960\n And that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort.\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:42.120\n You might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that I'm sitting in than I am.\n\n46:42.120 --> 46:44.120\n And therefore, the comparison is difficult.\n\n46:44.120 --> 46:49.720\n And therefore, working out a ratio involves you've got a decline in your, each time you\n\n46:49.720 --> 46:58.160\n give away a chair in exchange for an iPhone, you have a fall in your utility, okay?\n\n46:58.160 --> 47:03.380\n And then therefore, you want a higher return because you're losing more utility each time.\n\n47:03.380 --> 47:06.120\n The more chairs you give away, the less utility you're getting from chairs.\n\n47:06.120 --> 47:08.640\n So there's a decline in your utility.\n\n47:08.640 --> 47:11.060\n That's your marginal utility.\n\n47:11.060 --> 47:15.380\n So it's including your subjective valuation in setting the price.\n\n47:15.380 --> 47:20.960\n And what Marx pointed out is this is a caricature of actual change in a capitalist economy because\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:25.400\n we have, in a capitalist economy, huge factories turning out huge quantities, specifically\n\n47:25.400 --> 47:26.400\n for sale.\n\n47:26.400 --> 47:32.320\n They've got no utility to the seller unless they're sold, okay?\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:36.200\n So it's a very different vision of how price is set.\n\n47:36.200 --> 47:42.440\n And Marx used that to explain where profit comes from, but he made a mistake.\n\n47:42.440 --> 47:49.120\n And his argument was that talking about a worker, as now your unity, this foreground\n\n47:49.120 --> 47:55.820\n background tension thing, the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of production.\n\n47:55.820 --> 48:00.320\n And the cost of production is a subsistence wage, okay?\n\n48:00.320 --> 48:05.960\n Their utility to the buyer is the fact that they can work in a factory.\n\n48:05.960 --> 48:10.640\n Now, it might take six hours, let's say, to make the means of subsistence.\n\n48:10.640 --> 48:14.840\n And that's the exchange value, and that's what the capitalist pays as a wage to the\n\n48:14.840 --> 48:15.840\n worker.\n\n48:15.840 --> 48:18.380\n But they can work in the factory for 12 hours.\n\n48:18.380 --> 48:19.380\n That's the utility.\n\n48:19.380 --> 48:26.240\n 12 minus 6 is 6 surplus of value hours, and that's where profit comes from.\n\n48:26.240 --> 48:27.920\n And that was Marx's argument.\n\n48:27.920 --> 48:31.720\n And I thought it was brilliant, but it also applied to machinery.\n\n48:31.720 --> 48:32.720\n Right, okay.\n\n48:32.720 --> 48:33.720\n Let's blink on that.\n\n48:33.720 --> 48:34.720\n Hold on a second.\n\n48:34.720 --> 48:35.720\n No, no.\n\n48:35.720 --> 48:36.720\n Deep is good.\n\n48:36.720 --> 48:38.520\n You just want to define terms.\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:43.080\n Don't take that statement out of context, the internet, please.\n\n48:43.080 --> 48:44.080\n Okay.\n\n48:44.080 --> 48:52.920\n You said buyer, seller, worker in a factory, who's the seller, who's the buyer?\n\n48:52.920 --> 48:55.800\n Why is the worker the buyer?\n\n48:55.800 --> 48:58.200\n The worker is the commodity in this case.\n\n48:58.200 --> 49:01.760\n Because if you're going to make stuff in a factory, you've got to hire workers.\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:02.760\n Yes.\n\n49:02.760 --> 49:06.120\n And what Marx is saying, the buyer in that situation is a capitalist.\n\n49:06.120 --> 49:07.660\n So what does the buyer pay?\n\n49:07.660 --> 49:09.440\n He says he pays the exchange value.\n\n49:09.440 --> 49:13.040\n That's back to the commodity thing, because that's the starting point.\n\n49:13.040 --> 49:17.160\n He said the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity.\n\n49:17.160 --> 49:22.580\n A commodity has two characteristics, exchange value and use value.\n\n49:22.580 --> 49:26.520\n Exchange value of a commodity in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production.\n\n49:26.520 --> 49:31.220\n The use value is what you do with it, okay, once you've purchased it.\n\n49:31.220 --> 49:34.100\n But labor is a commodity?\n\n49:34.100 --> 49:38.120\n In this case, when a worker is being hired for a job, yes.\n\n49:38.120 --> 49:43.520\n So the worker's labor has an exchange value and a use value as well?\n\n49:43.520 --> 49:44.520\n That's it, yeah.\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:45.520\n Use value.\n\n49:45.520 --> 49:48.680\n Use value of a worker's labor.\n\n49:48.680 --> 49:49.680\n Exchange value.\n\n49:49.680 --> 49:54.320\n Let me think about that.\n\n49:54.320 --> 49:58.480\n So the hours they put in is the use value.\n\n49:58.480 --> 49:59.960\n Interesting.\n\n49:59.960 --> 50:05.000\n So what does the worker want in this?\n\n50:05.000 --> 50:06.000\n What are the motivations?\n\n50:06.000 --> 50:09.720\n Are we not considering the worker in this context as a human being?\n\n50:09.720 --> 50:14.020\n Well, you come in and that's actually, that's the next layer.\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:19.440\n What Marx gives us is like a layered cake, starting from a foundation of saying straight\n\n50:19.440 --> 50:23.940\n commodity exchange, and then saying, well, you're treating a worker as a commodity.\n\n50:23.940 --> 50:30.000\n Now a commodity is something like this, okay, that has, so far as I'm aware, no soul, okay?\n\n50:30.000 --> 50:32.680\n Not going to be complaining if I turn it upside down.\n\n50:32.680 --> 50:34.380\n It'll fall over.\n\n50:34.380 --> 50:39.600\n So there's no soul there as a human, is both a commodity and a noncommodity.\n\n50:39.600 --> 50:41.560\n And therefore there'll be a tension in the person.\n\n50:41.560 --> 50:43.040\n I'm being treated as a commodity here.\n\n50:43.040 --> 50:45.520\n I'm being paid just enough to stay alive.\n\n50:45.520 --> 50:48.760\n I've got a wife and kids back at home.\n\n50:48.760 --> 50:54.600\n So that is another layer of thinking in Marx, and on that layer he then says, well, workers\n\n50:54.600 --> 50:57.000\n will therefore demand more than their value.\n\n50:57.000 --> 50:58.800\n So that's when you get like political.\n\n50:58.800 --> 51:01.400\n You get political and you get money coming above that and so on.\n\n51:01.400 --> 51:07.240\n But the basic idea starts from the commodity is the fundamental unity in capitalism.\n\n51:07.240 --> 51:12.280\n The important commodity in Marx's thinking was the worker, because that's where he said\n\n51:12.280 --> 51:14.400\n profit came from, okay?\n\n51:14.400 --> 51:18.000\n And then that explains the motivation of the capitalist, and that ultimately is the labor\n\n51:18.000 --> 51:23.360\n theory of value and Marx's arguments about how capitalism will come to an end.\n\n51:23.360 --> 51:24.600\n Okay, okay, okay.\n\n51:24.600 --> 51:27.800\n So first of all, what is the labor theory of value?\n\n51:27.800 --> 51:30.680\n And actually before that, what is value?\n\n51:30.680 --> 51:35.440\n Is that, this is like me asking what's happiness.\n\n51:35.440 --> 51:38.640\n Is there something interesting to say about trying to define value?\n\n51:38.640 --> 51:45.240\n You vary, and this is a huge problem in economics is arguments of what does value mean?\n\n51:45.240 --> 51:48.480\n And the neoclassicals came down as that it's subjective.\n\n51:48.480 --> 51:54.080\n Its value is whatever you get out of it, but it's your personal evaluation of something,\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:55.520\n your personal feelings.\n\n51:55.520 --> 52:01.760\n So they've got that very subjective idea of value, whereas the Marxists, being inheritors\n\n52:01.760 --> 52:06.440\n of classical school, talk in terms of objective value.\n\n52:06.440 --> 52:11.880\n So the value is the number of hours it takes to make something, or the effort.\n\n52:11.880 --> 52:14.680\n Value is the effort that goes into making something in the classical school.\n\n52:14.680 --> 52:18.160\n Well, that's just one measure of objective.\n\n52:18.160 --> 52:19.160\n Where do you fall?\n\n52:19.160 --> 52:20.160\n Huh?\n\n52:20.160 --> 52:21.160\n Where do you fall?\n\n52:21.160 --> 52:22.160\n I fall on...\n\n52:22.160 --> 52:25.640\n Subjective versus objective spectrum of value.\n\n52:25.640 --> 52:30.440\n I think you have to have the capacity to move between one and the other in a structured\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:31.440\n way.\n\n52:31.440 --> 52:32.440\n The K model of value.\n\n52:32.440 --> 52:35.120\n Yeah, well, my base model is the objective, okay?\n\n52:35.120 --> 52:40.600\n But above that, as soon as you start talking, you said about the worker, for example, then\n\n52:40.600 --> 52:48.480\n you get involved in the subjectivity, because a worker will be angry, and justifiably so,\n\n52:48.480 --> 52:53.240\n about being treated as a commodity, because I'm not a commodity, I'm a human being, okay?\n\n52:53.240 --> 52:58.400\n And that's where Marx saw political organization coming from.\n\n52:58.400 --> 52:59.920\n And that's subjective now.\n\n52:59.920 --> 53:05.160\n And then when you get to money itself, Marx actually said, well, what's the value of money?\n\n53:05.160 --> 53:09.680\n Now if you use an objective theory of value, you would say, well, the value of money is\n\n53:09.680 --> 53:11.520\n its cost of production.\n\n53:11.520 --> 53:13.000\n What's the cost of producing a dollar?\n\n53:13.000 --> 53:15.160\n It's about two cents.\n\n53:15.160 --> 53:20.480\n So he said it can't be, the value of money cannot be its cost of production.\n\n53:20.480 --> 53:25.240\n Or the most value, I think if I remember the phrase properly, is value here as it must\n\n53:25.240 --> 53:33.200\n mean the, effectively, uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.\n\n53:33.200 --> 53:35.000\n Uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.\n\n53:35.000 --> 53:36.760\n Okay, but he's okay with that?\n\n53:36.760 --> 53:40.200\n He was okay with that, because he could move between different levels, because he had a\n\n53:40.200 --> 53:46.800\n structured foundation of this dialectical vision of foreground, background tension,\n\n53:46.800 --> 53:52.400\n commodity, having use value, exchange value, and a gap between the two when you're talking\n\n53:52.400 --> 53:56.200\n about machines, when you're buying stuff for production.\n\n53:56.200 --> 54:00.680\n And then at the next level, he could look at workers, worker organization, and say that's\n\n54:00.680 --> 54:04.940\n driven by being treated as a commodity when you're a noncommodity.\n\n54:04.940 --> 54:13.600\n So the basic labor theory of value that is described to Karl Marx is that value at the\n\n54:13.600 --> 54:19.960\n base layer fundamentally comes from the labor you put into something.\n\n54:19.960 --> 54:26.080\n And you say, well, there's some deep truth there, except he misses one fundamental point,\n\n54:26.080 --> 54:30.400\n which is machines can also bring value to the world.\n\n54:30.400 --> 54:38.720\n He was saying they don't, the only thing that matters is human labor, not labor.\n\n54:38.720 --> 54:45.120\n How do you measure what's the role of whatever value machines bring to the world?\n\n54:45.120 --> 54:51.120\n This is another intriguing history, because Marx, when he first started, had what you\n\n54:51.120 --> 54:57.600\n can call an exclusivist explanation for why labor created value.\n\n54:57.600 --> 55:03.560\n And that was to say that labor is the only commodity with both what he called commodity\n\n55:03.560 --> 55:04.880\n and commodity power.\n\n55:04.880 --> 55:09.080\n So you have labor and labor power.\n\n55:09.080 --> 55:13.960\n Labor is the, and I get fuzzy about this, I haven't read it for something like 30 years,\n\n55:13.960 --> 55:17.000\n but labor has both commodity and commodity power.\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:22.200\n The commodity is you can buy labor, which is the means of subsistence.\n\n55:22.200 --> 55:25.280\n Labor power is the capacity to work inside a factory.\n\n55:25.280 --> 55:29.680\n There's a difference between the two, therefore that difference will give rise to surplus.\n\n55:29.680 --> 55:34.280\n And there's no other commodity that has this essence of commodity and commodity power.\n\n55:34.280 --> 55:36.440\n So that was his exclusivist argument.\n\n55:36.440 --> 55:44.920\n In the middle of 1857, he was visited by a guy called Otto Brau in his home in Chelsea.\n\n55:44.920 --> 55:51.440\n And Otto returned to Marx a copy of Hegel's, I think it's called Phenomenology of Right,\n\n55:51.440 --> 55:53.560\n I haven't read it, but that's the book.\n\n55:53.560 --> 55:58.600\n And Marx was then at that stage reading through all the classical theorists again.\n\n55:58.600 --> 56:01.360\n And he was, suddenly he read Hegel again.\n\n56:01.360 --> 56:04.800\n And if you know Hunter S. Thompson, okay, okay.\n\n56:04.800 --> 56:06.560\n Who doesn't know Hunter S. Thompson?\n\n56:06.560 --> 56:08.040\n Somebody who hasn't had enough drugs, obviously.\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:09.040\n Yeah.\n\n56:09.040 --> 56:10.040\n But Hunter S. Thompson.\n\n56:10.040 --> 56:12.280\n He comes to you in a dream after you take your first puff of...\n\n56:12.280 --> 56:13.280\n Mescaline or...\n\n56:13.280 --> 56:14.280\n Or whatever.\n\n56:14.280 --> 56:15.280\n And of course, we've all...\n\n56:15.280 --> 56:18.640\n If you know your drugs well enough, you can tell, okay, he's stoned, okay, he's on cocaine,\n\n56:18.640 --> 56:19.640\n you know.\n\n56:19.640 --> 56:24.080\n But suddenly, his writing style in the middle of a book called The Grundrisse completely\n\n56:24.080 --> 56:25.080\n changed.\n\n56:25.080 --> 56:26.080\n He switched from weed to cocaine.\n\n56:26.080 --> 56:28.760\n He switched from Ricardo to Hegel, okay.\n\n56:28.760 --> 56:33.280\n And what in Ricardo, he had this exclusivist argument about labor, and suddenly Hegel is\n\n56:33.280 --> 56:38.480\n back talking in terms of dialectics, not actually using a word, but foreground and background\n\n56:38.480 --> 56:40.220\n and tension.\n\n56:40.220 --> 56:41.220\n And then he...\n\n56:41.220 --> 56:46.000\n That's where this use value, exchange value, attention thing came from, is rereading Hegel\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:51.960\n 13 years after he stopped reading philosophy, because made in 44, he was reading just The\n\n56:51.960 --> 56:52.960\n Economists.\n\n56:52.960 --> 56:55.800\n So you're saying Karl Marx is human after all.\n\n56:55.800 --> 56:56.800\n He's human.\n\n56:56.800 --> 56:57.800\n He could be...\n\n56:57.800 --> 56:58.800\n I would love to have a beer with Karl.\n\n56:58.800 --> 56:59.800\n For a wine.\n\n56:59.800 --> 57:00.800\n For Karl?\n\n57:00.800 --> 57:01.800\n He's Karl to you?\n\n57:01.800 --> 57:03.360\n He's Mr. Marx to me.\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:04.360\n Hang on.\n\n57:04.360 --> 57:06.960\n He'd be Karl to me, I'm afraid, after all these years.\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:07.960\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n57:07.960 --> 57:09.500\n You've had quite a journey together.\n\n57:09.500 --> 57:15.560\n So that's where after Hegel, his interpretation of the dialectic comes in the form of background,\n\n57:15.560 --> 57:16.560\n foreground, and background.\n\n57:16.560 --> 57:21.440\n And then on page 267 of the Penguin edition of the Grundrisse.\n\n57:21.440 --> 57:22.440\n What early?\n\n57:22.440 --> 57:23.440\n Your memory...\n\n57:23.440 --> 57:24.440\n One and a half pages long footnote.\n\n57:24.440 --> 57:25.440\n It's pretty hard to forget.\n\n57:25.440 --> 57:30.720\n Because when I did this, when I first read Marx way, way back when I was...\n\n57:30.720 --> 57:31.720\n How old was I?\n\n57:31.720 --> 57:32.720\n 20.\n\n57:32.720 --> 57:33.720\n Okay.\n\n57:33.720 --> 57:38.560\n I tried to explain my explanation of Marx's use value, exchange value stuff to my colleagues\n\n57:38.560 --> 57:43.240\n in this philosophy discussion room at Sydney University during a beautiful summer that\n\n57:43.240 --> 57:47.400\n we were inside, concrete and sandstone walls discussing Marx.\n\n57:47.400 --> 57:52.600\n And I went to say, look, the use value, exchange value argument can be applied to a machine.\n\n57:52.600 --> 57:54.000\n What's the exchange value of a machine?\n\n57:54.000 --> 57:55.680\n It's cost of manufacturing it.\n\n57:55.680 --> 57:56.840\n What's its use value?\n\n57:56.840 --> 57:59.800\n Its capacity to produce goods for sale.\n\n57:59.800 --> 58:03.440\n No relation between the two, there'll be a gap, a machine can be a source of profit.\n\n58:03.440 --> 58:07.760\n Now, I said that and I got laughed at and I quite literally laughed at.\n\n58:07.760 --> 58:13.760\n So when I went back to university 13 years later to do my master's degree, I chose to\n\n58:13.760 --> 58:18.640\n read through and find in Marx where he first came across this insight.\n\n58:18.640 --> 58:24.960\n So my first master's thesis failed, by the way, and justifiably so.\n\n58:24.960 --> 58:29.720\n I didn't know the level of academic discourse necessary.\n\n58:29.720 --> 58:32.880\n I had an advisor who didn't understand what I was writing.\n\n58:32.880 --> 58:39.480\n He got me to write for his New Keynesian audience and it was a mess and it got failed.\n\n58:39.480 --> 58:40.480\n So I got rid of him.\n\n58:40.480 --> 58:41.480\n Did it get failed?\n\n58:41.480 --> 58:43.000\n Why do you think?\n\n58:43.000 --> 58:44.280\n It wasn't a good thesis.\n\n58:44.280 --> 58:46.400\n I didn't know the level.\n\n58:46.400 --> 58:51.000\n It was written for an audience my supervisor thought that I should be writing for, and\n\n58:51.000 --> 58:52.000\n it was a mess.\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:59.440\n And so I met another guy, Jeff Fishburne, as a lecturer at New South Wales University.\n\n58:59.440 --> 59:00.840\n And Jeff was open minded.\n\n59:00.840 --> 59:04.560\n He was not a conventional neoclassical thinker.\n\n59:04.560 --> 59:09.720\n And I realized I'd throw out the half that Bill had got me to do, focused just on Marx.\n\n59:09.720 --> 59:15.080\n And so I decided to read Marx in chronological sequence from his very first works of economics,\n\n59:15.080 --> 59:18.880\n which are called the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.\n\n59:18.880 --> 59:23.760\n And he wrote those in a garret in Paris after he'd been expelled from Prussia.\n\n59:23.760 --> 59:30.260\n And so he decided to read having been an expert on philosophy and regarded it as the towering\n\n59:30.260 --> 59:36.380\n intellect of Hegelian philosophy in Prussia, but driven out because he was a radical.\n\n59:36.380 --> 59:42.560\n He ended up running a newspaper or being writing for a newspaper, and he was reporting about\n\n59:42.560 --> 59:47.840\n the eviction of peasants from the forests, taking away their feudal rights.\n\n59:47.840 --> 59:53.040\n And so this is where his passion for economics and humanity came from.\n\n59:53.040 --> 59:55.120\n And he was a poet as well.\n\n59:55.120 --> 59:58.760\n I mean, he loved poetry to Jenny von Westhalen.\n\n59:58.760 --> 1:00:01.880\n His first published works were pretty much in poetry.\n\n1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:05.240\n He was a rouse about, he was a wild character.\n\n1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:09.080\n We'd probably fight like crazy, I imagine, if we met.\n\n1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:10.080\n Over the beers?\n\n1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:16.760\n I'm slightly, even though I can be, I can get involved in an argument like nobody's\n\n1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:17.760\n business.\n\n1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:18.760\n No, really?\n\n1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:19.760\n No, really.\n\n1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:21.240\n But I'm a bit more peaceful of personality.\n\n1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:23.240\n Oh, you think Marx is feistier than you?\n\n1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:27.600\n He was feisty, but feisty with, he could be arrogant.\n\n1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:31.680\n Like I've got an intellectual arrogance, I've come to accept that.\n\n1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:33.920\n But there's like a fundamental humility to you.\n\n1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:37.160\n You're saying Marx is like, has ego that's hard to control.\n\n1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.160\n A bit too big ego, yeah.\n\n1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:39.160\n I'm guessing.\n\n1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:40.480\n I mean, I'm never going to meet him.\n\n1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:42.320\n Well, the beard says ego to me.\n\n1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:43.640\n The beard is huge, yeah.\n\n1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:44.640\n That's huge.\n\n1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:45.640\n Okay.\n\n1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:46.640\n So this is interesting.\n\n1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.000\n So you went chronologically right through his works, the development of the human being\n\n1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.000\n through his works.\n\n1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.440\n And I was trying to find the point at which he discovered this use value exchange value\n\n1:00:55.440 --> 1:00:56.520\n idea.\n\n1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:02.640\n And it occurs in a footnote on page 267 to 268 of the Penguin edition of the Guindrisa,\n\n1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:07.440\n which his notes he was taking literally not meant for publication, literally sitting at\n\n1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:13.800\n a stall inside the British Museum, I think, reading all the classical authors in chronological\n\n1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:14.800\n sequence.\n\n1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.680\n And then somebody throws Hegel at him, and suddenly he's talking in Hegelian terms.\n\n1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:24.560\n And he suddenly says, is not, because it's whole value issues, what is value?\n\n1:01:24.560 --> 1:01:26.120\n Is it exchange value, use value?\n\n1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:27.440\n How do they relate to each other?\n\n1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:28.440\n That's what he was thinking about.\n\n1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:34.200\n And he said, is not use value, which was left out of the classical school, a fundamental\n\n1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:36.320\n aspect of the commodity?\n\n1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:39.880\n Is there not a tension between the use value and exchange value?\n\n1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:44.680\n Just so we're clear in that context, use value is kind of the subjective thing, exchange\n\n1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:45.680\n value is the objective thing.\n\n1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:46.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:46.680 --> 1:01:49.320\n And Marx was, found a way to integrate the two.\n\n1:01:49.320 --> 1:01:57.000\n He was focused on labor being the only thing that can generate both the use value and the\n\n1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.000\n exchange value.\n\n1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:59.000\n But, no.\n\n1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.600\n If you look at the classical school, they focus on exchange value, objective.\n\n1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:09.280\n Look at the neoclassical, they focus upon use value, subjective, or they call it utility.\n\n1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.920\n So Marx, coming from the Ricardian tradition, basically dismissed the role of utility.\n\n1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:20.480\n And then when he reads Hegel, he's suddenly starting to think in terms of unities.\n\n1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:24.680\n And exchange value and use value is the unity of the commodity.\n\n1:02:24.680 --> 1:02:27.840\n And he thinks, well, I can't ignore use value.\n\n1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.760\n So rather than leaving it out completely, which is what Ricardo and Smith does, I've\n\n1:02:31.760 --> 1:02:32.920\n got to somehow bring it in.\n\n1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:35.680\n And this Hegelian insight occurs to him.\n\n1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:39.800\n And it's remarkable, I really recommend taking a look at the book, even just to look at that\n\n1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:44.120\n particular page, because what it would have been, as shown as a footnote, but it would\n\n1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:50.660\n have been him saying, oh, wow, and his asterisk, asterisk, is not use value, a fundamental\n\n1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:53.480\n aspect of the unity of a commodity.\n\n1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:57.640\n So in the notes, you see the discovery of an idea in the human mind, the integration\n\n1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:58.640\n of an idea.\n\n1:02:58.640 --> 1:02:59.640\n And it's beautiful.\n\n1:02:59.640 --> 1:03:02.200\n And he actually writes, does this have significance in economics, question mark.\n\n1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:06.760\n And then he probably went home that night, and that idea changed him.\n\n1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:08.880\n Yeah, it changed him completely.\n\n1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:11.120\n And from that point on, his writing was completely different.\n\n1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:15.920\n But he still had this idea from the Ricardian days of saying that labor is the only source\n\n1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:20.840\n of value, using an exclusive argument to say there's something unique about labor that\n\n1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:22.640\n explains why it's a source of value.\n\n1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:26.920\n But suddenly, this insight occurs to him, and he thinks, I can get a positive derivation.\n\n1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:31.960\n I can use use value and exchange value and the fact they're not related to each other\n\n1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:35.040\n as a dialectical tension to explain surplus value.\n\n1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:36.040\n And that's what he does.\n\n1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:41.720\n So he goes from a negative explanation of where value comes from to a positive explanation\n\n1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.480\n on that page of the Guindarisa.\n\n1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:49.460\n He then triumphantly uses it to explain why labor is a source of value.\n\n1:03:49.460 --> 1:03:51.360\n You buy it for its exchange value.\n\n1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:52.840\n You use its use value.\n\n1:03:52.840 --> 1:03:53.840\n They're unrelated.\n\n1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:55.100\n The use value will be bigger.\n\n1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:56.820\n That's where profit comes from.\n\n1:03:56.820 --> 1:04:01.200\n Then he does exactly the same thing for machinery, about 30 pages on.\n\n1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:06.760\n He says it also has to be contemplated, which was not done before.\n\n1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:09.320\n This is wrote nice to himself, by the way.\n\n1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:14.800\n It's written really in a colloquial style, that the use value of a machine is significantly\n\n1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:16.200\n greater than its exchange value.\n\n1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:17.760\n He actually left out the word is.\n\n1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:23.000\n It's used to be a translation into English of the German, I'm sure.\n\n1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000\n I don't know.\n\n1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.000\n I haven't seen the original notes.\n\n1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000\n I'd love to see them.\n\n1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.200\n But he says, he leaves out the word is.\n\n1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:34.720\n It also has to be contemplated that the use value is significantly greater than its exchange\n\n1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:43.240\n value, i.e. that the contribution of the machine to production exceeds its depreciation.\n\n1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:48.840\n That was an insight which undermined his explanation for revolution.\n\n1:04:48.840 --> 1:04:49.840\n Okay.\n\n1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:52.520\n Can you say that again?\n\n1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:57.600\n The cost of production exceeds its depreciation?\n\n1:04:57.600 --> 1:04:58.600\n Can you linger on that?\n\n1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:02.640\n Well, what Marx argued, and you read this in Capital, and I read this in Capital when\n\n1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:07.160\n I first saw the contradiction in his own thought.\n\n1:05:07.160 --> 1:05:12.840\n He said that no matter how useful a machine is, whether it took a hundred hours to make\n\n1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:22.680\n or cost 150 pounds, it cannot under any circumstances add more to production than 150 pounds, which\n\n1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:31.520\n in his old exclusivist logic he could justify, and which in his post 1857 argument is bullshit.\n\n1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.320\n Can you steel man his case?\n\n1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:39.920\n Can we go to the mind of Marx and thinking if a machine costs a hundred bucks, it can't\n\n1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:43.280\n be ever more, bring more value than a hundred bucks to the world?\n\n1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:49.720\n But that contradicts his previous logic, because what he said is commodities are the essential\n\n1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:52.400\n unity in capitalism.\n\n1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:54.960\n Capitalism focuses upon the exchange value.\n\n1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:59.840\n That pushes the use value into the background, and there's a tension between the two.\n\n1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:04.200\n What that means is the exchange value of a commodity sets its price.\n\n1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:06.580\n The use value is independent.\n\n1:06:06.580 --> 1:06:07.960\n He called them incommensurable.\n\n1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:13.360\n He literally used the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value, whereas\n\n1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.480\n neoclassicals make them commensurable.\n\n1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:21.320\n So he's saying exchange value and use value incommensurable, and that normally means that\n\n1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:25.240\n exchange value is objective, like the number of hours it takes to make something.\n\n1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:30.240\n Use value is subjective, how comfortable the chair is, the fact that you can sit in a chair.\n\n1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:35.320\n So that's incommensurability, but when you apply it in production, the exchange value\n\n1:06:35.320 --> 1:06:36.800\n of something is objective.\n\n1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:40.920\n It's how many hours it takes to make a machine or how many hours it takes to make the means\n\n1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:42.720\n of subsistence for a worker.\n\n1:06:42.720 --> 1:06:44.880\n The use value is also objective.\n\n1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:49.700\n You're making commodities for sale, and the worker does six hours.\n\n1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:55.920\n Six hours of work will make the means of subsistence for the worker, but the worker will work a\n\n1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:59.640\n twelve hour day, and the six hours becomes a gap.\n\n1:06:59.640 --> 1:07:05.000\n Now that's incommensurability between use value and exchange value of labor, but when\n\n1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.840\n you look at what he said about no matter how long it takes to make a machine or how many\n\n1:07:09.840 --> 1:07:15.280\n pounds it costs, he's saying they're identical, and that's contradicting his own logic.\n\n1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.880\n Well, what's the use value of a machine?\n\n1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:23.360\n The fact that it can produce goods for sale, exactly the same as the worker.\n\n1:07:23.360 --> 1:07:30.280\n Now in my modern reinterpretation of Marx, which brings in my work on energy, I see both\n\n1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:36.800\n labor and machinery as a means to harness energy and produce useful work, and they can\n\n1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:37.800\n both do that.\n\n1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:39.400\n In fact, they do it together.\n\n1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:40.680\n It's a collective enterprise.\n\n1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:44.360\n Okay, so, and we'll go to that.\n\n1:07:44.360 --> 1:07:48.820\n So there's no fundamental difference from an exchange value and use value perspective\n\n1:07:48.820 --> 1:07:50.280\n between a human and a machine.\n\n1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:54.160\n And therefore, they're using the same logic that can both be a source of surplus, which\n\n1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:00.040\n is what Marx contradicted because his explanation for where socialism would come from is that\n\n1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:03.000\n only profit comes from, like profit comes only from labor.\n\n1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:08.160\n Over time, we'll add more machinery than labor that will mean a falling rate of profit and\n\n1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.120\n therefore a tendency towards socialism.\n\n1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:16.580\n And what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea about what would lead\n\n1:08:16.580 --> 1:08:19.600\n to socialism, and he couldn't cope with it.\n\n1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:30.280\n Okay, what's the difference between Marxian economics and Marxist political ideology?\n\n1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:34.520\n The gap between the two, the overlap, the differences, what?\n\n1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:39.360\n The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that there would\n\n1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:42.880\n be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall.\n\n1:08:42.880 --> 1:08:48.520\n And that tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists battening down\n\n1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:55.720\n on workers harder, paying them less than their subsistence, a revolt by workers against this,\n\n1:08:55.720 --> 1:08:58.420\n and then you would get socialism on the other side.\n\n1:08:58.420 --> 1:09:03.920\n So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in\n\n1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:07.080\n his explanation for why socialism would have to come about.\n\n1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:13.000\n He was saying it would have to come about, or is it a good thing for it to come about?\n\n1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.620\n He had a should, but he was trying to say it must.\n\n1:09:16.620 --> 1:09:22.720\n So if you look at Marx in the history of radical thought, he was preceded by what were called\n\n1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:24.440\n utopian socialists.\n\n1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:30.040\n Saint Simon, even the Cadbury's company came out of utopian socialist, and they had an\n\n1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:34.400\n idea about a perfect society in the future where people were properly rewarded, were\n\n1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.400\n treated as human beings rather than cogs in a machine and all this sort of stuff.\n\n1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:42.840\n And they said socialism should come about because it treats humans better than capitalism\n\n1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:43.840\n does.\n\n1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:47.660\n Marx said, I can prove that socialism must come about.\n\n1:09:47.660 --> 1:09:53.280\n So he preferred, he had a utopian vision of a future society, but he thought he could\n\n1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:55.080\n prove that it had to come about.\n\n1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:01.720\n And the proof relied critically upon tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and that relied\n\n1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:06.040\n upon labor being the only source of profit.\n\n1:10:06.040 --> 1:10:07.800\n What was his utopian view?\n\n1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.160\n So this idea from each according to his ability to each according to his needs.\n\n1:10:13.160 --> 1:10:16.000\n Is that the utopian?\n\n1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:21.080\n I think it's utopian in the context of our modern world.\n\n1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:27.520\n It says that rather than being rewarded, like Jeff Bezos gets enormous fortune, you get\n\n1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:32.280\n what you need, not what you want, necessarily.\n\n1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:33.680\n All needs is fulfilled.\n\n1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:38.280\n It was a vision of utopia where you could be a fisherman in the morning, a poet in\n\n1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:43.820\n the afternoon, and a chef at night, this paraphrasing one of his phrases.\n\n1:10:43.820 --> 1:10:48.480\n So he did have a utopian vision of a future society, and he did think human creativity\n\n1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:52.320\n would be much, much greater under socialism than it was under capitalism.\n\n1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:54.400\n He was wrong.\n\n1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:57.120\n So let's explore in different ways where he was wrong.\n\n1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:04.360\n You're saying there's a fundamental flaw in the logic, but also if we can explore high\n\n1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:10.120\n level philosophical concepts of socialism too, like the dreams of a utopia.\n\n1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:14.800\n So first of all, what is socialism?\n\n1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:17.640\n That's another loaded term.\n\n1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:19.800\n Socialism particularly in America is a very loaded term.\n\n1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:26.480\n What Americans call socialist is a large amount of provision of services by the state, which\n\n1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:28.280\n is commonplace in Europe.\n\n1:11:28.280 --> 1:11:34.360\n It's still moderately commonplace in my own home country of Australia.\n\n1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:38.700\n And that Americans will call public education socialist.\n\n1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:42.360\n It's a total parody of the word.\n\n1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:46.920\n Strictly speaking, what socialism meant is the public ownership of the means of production,\n\n1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:49.900\n no private ownership of the means of production.\n\n1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:51.680\n What is the means of production?\n\n1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:52.680\n Machine factories.\n\n1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:53.680\n Factories.\n\n1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:59.920\n So all the goods that are produced in factories, no, the means of producing the goods is owned\n\n1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:01.680\n by a centralized entity.\n\n1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:02.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:03.680\n Centrally planned.\n\n1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:07.640\n This is what actually was done under Gold's plan under the Soviets.\n\n1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:09.880\n And even with the collective farms as well.\n\n1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:11.520\n You no longer own your land.\n\n1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:13.420\n The state owns the land.\n\n1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:15.200\n You worked on the land.\n\n1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:16.680\n And this was supposed to be a utopia.\n\n1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:19.400\n Now it didn't turn out to be one.\n\n1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:23.480\n And we'll talk about maybe your ideas of why it didn't turn out to be one.\n\n1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:25.880\n So the fascists did the same.\n\n1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:28.120\n So is this fascism also central?\n\n1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:31.120\n Fascism, so called national socialism.\n\n1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:32.680\n It's also a kind of socialism.\n\n1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:36.840\n So yeah, but there was no, it wasn't a public owner, there was public direction.\n\n1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:40.760\n So the state would tell factories what to do, but there's still a private profit.\n\n1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:44.900\n And a large part of why the Nazis succeeded was the extent to which they managed to coopt\n\n1:12:44.900 --> 1:12:47.680\n major manufacturers in Germany.\n\n1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:50.240\n So it's, you know.\n\n1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:51.240\n Direction versus ownership.\n\n1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:52.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:56.520\n A dictatorial, I mean, that's a very particular implementation.\n\n1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:01.120\n So you have to consider the full details of the implementation, but it's basically dictator\n\n1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:02.120\n guided.\n\n1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:03.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:09.200\n And if you want to take a proper vision, then you have to say it's the ownership of the\n\n1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.280\n means of production by the state.\n\n1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:12.280\n Okay.\n\n1:13:12.280 --> 1:13:14.100\n Versus the ownership by private.\n\n1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:16.700\n That rules out the Nazi period.\n\n1:13:16.700 --> 1:13:22.520\n Use the word that, again, they're bastardizing as much as Americans do in the opposite direction.\n\n1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:26.840\n Well, what does ownership exactly mean?\n\n1:13:26.840 --> 1:13:31.080\n Well, it became incredibly complicated.\n\n1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:36.680\n And this is actually the best work on this is done by recently deceased Hungarian economist\n\n1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:38.680\n called Janos Kornai.\n\n1:13:38.680 --> 1:13:42.880\n And Kornai tried to explain why socialism failed.\n\n1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:45.320\n Because why did socialism fail in your view?\n\n1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:47.360\n In his view, in Janos's view, in your view.\n\n1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:49.600\n I think Janos is 100% correct.\n\n1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:53.860\n It's a brilliant piece of work, so I'm going to be really paraphrasing his view.\n\n1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:59.560\n And he imagined an ideal socialist society, and there wasn't a Stalin, there weren't\n\n1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.440\n purges, and you lived up to all the ideals that Marx had for socialism.\n\n1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:09.440\n So he said, but you do it in a context of an economy which is incredibly primitive,\n\n1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:10.440\n Russia.\n\n1:14:10.440 --> 1:14:11.440\n Okay?\n\n1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:13.360\n Because if you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen\n\n1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:15.420\n in England.\n\n1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:18.920\n The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.\n\n1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:23.420\n The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition.\n\n1:14:23.420 --> 1:14:26.740\n And this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.\n\n1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.780\n So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks\n\n1:14:30.780 --> 1:14:33.360\n believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.\n\n1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:36.600\n Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.\n\n1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:42.360\n The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go, bypass the capitalist phase, do\n\n1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.240\n the development under socialism rather than under capitalism.\n\n1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:50.040\n And this is what Yanis was actually analyzing.\n\n1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:57.120\n You start from a primitive feudal economy, very little industrialization, and you want\n\n1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:04.560\n to jump to an advanced industrial society from that foundation.\n\n1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:10.080\n So he said what you have then for is a whole range of industries, all of which need as\n\n1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.880\n much resources as you can get for them.\n\n1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:19.680\n So you want to develop agriculture, mining, industry, every little division of it.\n\n1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:24.300\n They all have legitimate demands on the resources of the country and the state.\n\n1:15:24.300 --> 1:15:29.320\n That means that all your resources are fully employed and are probably over employed.\n\n1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:33.020\n So you have a resource constraint in that society.\n\n1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:38.720\n The easiest way to cope with a resource constraint is to produce last year's commodity, not to\n\n1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:40.840\n innovate, not to make change.\n\n1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:46.140\n So what they will give you is as you start to add, you invest so you now have the beginnings\n\n1:15:46.140 --> 1:15:51.160\n of a steel industry, beginnings of a car industry, and so on, you start investing, but you continue\n\n1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:54.560\n producing the same product you made last year.\n\n1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:59.040\n And I have a perfect personal example of that, which I'll throw in now if you like a pretty\n\n1:15:59.040 --> 1:16:00.040\n heavy conversation.\n\n1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:08.000\n I know my first major girlfriend had a brother who wanted to get a motorbike, but he couldn't\n\n1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.320\n afford a Honda or a Kawasaki.\n\n1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:17.000\n At the time, they cost about $3,000 for a 650 cc Japanese motorbike.\n\n1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:23.440\n He found he could buy a Cossack for $650, $1 per cc.\n\n1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:30.320\n So I was there when he got this is in suburban Sylvania waters in Sydney.\n\n1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:35.320\n So this crate arrives with a Cossack motorbike inside it.\n\n1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:38.840\n So we take it apart, it's then got all these wooden palings, we have to pull off the wooden\n\n1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:40.400\n palings to open it up.\n\n1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:44.780\n Then there's oil soaked rag over this thing, which is tied on a wooden base.\n\n1:16:44.780 --> 1:16:50.560\n We take the oil soaked rag off and we stare in all its glory in a 1942 BMW.\n\n1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:55.200\n It was exactly the same as Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.\n\n1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:59.320\n So the Russians for 30 years were making the same bloody motorbike.\n\n1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:02.440\n It had a bicycle seat.\n\n1:17:02.440 --> 1:17:03.960\n And that's how they cope.\n\n1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:06.200\n They've just made the same damn machine every year.\n\n1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:09.240\n And he said, so that's the outcome.\n\n1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:10.920\n You actually want the best possible world.\n\n1:17:10.920 --> 1:17:13.080\n You're trying to build as fast as possible.\n\n1:17:13.080 --> 1:17:16.480\n You're paying workers as high wages as you possibly can.\n\n1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:19.360\n And that leads to a world where you don't innovate.\n\n1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:24.640\n But he said capitalism, on the other hand, pure capitalist economy, you're trying to\n\n1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.940\n pay workers as little as possible.\n\n1:17:26.940 --> 1:17:28.560\n You have competitive industries.\n\n1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:31.280\n You're trying to take demand away from your rivals.\n\n1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:37.360\n You have Kawasaki versus Honda versus BMW, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:41.780\n The way you get demand away from your competitors is by innovating.\n\n1:17:41.780 --> 1:17:46.200\n So what you will get is cycles and booms and slumps, but you'll innovate and change over\n\n1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:47.200\n time.\n\n1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:52.880\n So what you find was this huge gap between socialist volume production with no innovation\n\n1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.860\n and capitalism with innovation.\n\n1:17:55.860 --> 1:18:02.200\n So that was the fundamental failing that Janos Korneis saw, so why did socialism not innovate?\n\n1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:08.600\n Because if you go back to this famous historical incident with Khrushchev in the United Nations,\n\n1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:12.420\n bangs Texophe Shewan, bangs the desk, says, we will bury you.\n\n1:18:12.420 --> 1:18:15.200\n He literally meant we're going to bury you in commodities.\n\n1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.580\n We're going to produce more output than you are.\n\n1:18:17.580 --> 1:18:19.920\n And he was wrong.\n\n1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:25.480\n Because fundamentally, in the long term, to bury somebody in commodity production, you\n\n1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:26.480\n have to innovate.\n\n1:18:26.480 --> 1:18:27.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:33.680\n And there's also another remarkable Soviet engineer who was given the job of interpreting\n\n1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:36.560\n Marx's ideas of industrial sectors.\n\n1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:42.640\n So he had the commodity sphere, the industry sphere, sector one, sector two, sector three.\n\n1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:46.060\n Sector one producing consumer goods, sector two producing capital goods, sector three\n\n1:18:46.060 --> 1:18:49.000\n producing luxury goods for capitalists.\n\n1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:53.160\n And so he had a three sector model of the economy, and he was talking about the dynamics\n\n1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:54.600\n between them.\n\n1:18:54.600 --> 1:18:59.040\n And what Feldman did was reinterpret this as an engineer would reinterpret it, which\n\n1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:00.920\n was brilliant work.\n\n1:19:00.920 --> 1:19:05.520\n So what he said was, you need to produce the means of production.\n\n1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:09.920\n If you want to grow quickly, you focus on producing the means of production rather than\n\n1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:10.920\n commodities.\n\n1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.080\n So you don't make cars, you make car factories.\n\n1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:14.080\n Okay?\n\n1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:17.480\n You make a few cars, but most of the effort goes into expanding how many factories you\n\n1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:18.480\n have.\n\n1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:21.880\n And what he did was do a mathematical model where you start off with very low levels of\n\n1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:24.960\n consumer good output, but then you would just go exponential.\n\n1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:25.960\n Okay?\n\n1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:29.520\n Now, I took a look at that back when I was doing my master's degree.\n\n1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:35.960\n And the training in mathematics, I took Feldman's equations and then looked at what was actually\n\n1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.960\n driving it was he was imagining correctly a huge pool of unemployed labor.\n\n1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:46.280\n If you go back to the earliest stages of Soviet industrialization back in 1917, post the Second\n\n1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:50.520\n World, post the First World War, you had all these unemployed workers, you had all these\n\n1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:53.540\n peasants you could take off the land and put into factories.\n\n1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:57.240\n So you had a huge supply of workers.\n\n1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.200\n What you had to do was build the factories.\n\n1:19:59.200 --> 1:20:06.280\n See building the factories, but at a certain point you exhaust the supply of lowly employed\n\n1:20:06.280 --> 1:20:07.940\n or unemployed labor.\n\n1:20:07.940 --> 1:20:12.920\n And so rather than having this exponential takeoff, you hit a ceiling and then you can\n\n1:20:12.920 --> 1:20:16.800\n only grow as fast as the population because you're not innovating.\n\n1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:20.340\n So that's what actually hit the Soviet system.\n\n1:20:20.340 --> 1:20:23.880\n And it's why they never buried the Western consumer goods.\n\n1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:28.860\n And instead why Western consumers looked in envy at the goods being purchased by their\n\n1:20:28.860 --> 1:20:33.920\n Western people and said, if that's exploitation, we want exploitation.\n\n1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:40.620\n So okay, there's a lot of interesting stuff to ask here, which is, so Marx's vision for\n\n1:20:40.620 --> 1:20:48.000\n the socialist utopia is you have to go through capitalism.\n\n1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.520\n The Mensheviks were true to Marx's original idea.\n\n1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:57.560\n So is there a case to be made that in the long arc of human history on like human civilization\n\n1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:05.480\n on earth that we're going to live out Marx's vision for utopia, which is like, will we\n\n1:21:05.480 --> 1:21:07.320\n run into a wall with capitalism?\n\n1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:09.200\n I think we are running into a wall with capitalism.\n\n1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:11.800\n In fact, I think we've already gone through the wall and we haven't yet realized we've\n\n1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:16.240\n smashed our skulls.\n\n1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:22.360\n But on the other side, we're bleeding and everything like that.\n\n1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:26.480\n Does Marx have any insights on what the other side of capitalism, what is beyond capitalism?\n\n1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:30.680\n I think that beautiful phrase of from each according to his ability to each according\n\n1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:36.140\n to his needs describes what we should end up with.\n\n1:21:36.140 --> 1:21:40.580\n And I think that's actually, if I think about, you know, I'm an Elon Musk fan.\n\n1:21:40.580 --> 1:21:45.160\n That's what I think is partially going to be the nature of society if we build one that\n\n1:21:45.160 --> 1:21:47.240\n functions on Mars.\n\n1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:52.460\n Because and I've actually seen the interview with the Italian who's involved in designing\n\n1:21:52.460 --> 1:21:54.800\n what the future colony will look like.\n\n1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:00.320\n He was actually asked this question, can there be enormous inequality in Martian civilization?\n\n1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:02.440\n The guy said, absolutely not.\n\n1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:06.080\n Because the resources, again, resource constraint applies.\n\n1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:11.560\n You simply can't give somebody underground bunker 100 times the size of somebody else's\n\n1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.920\n 100 underground bunker.\n\n1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:22.240\n Because the scarcity of resources imposes a need for equality overall.\n\n1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:23.240\n Is that always?\n\n1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:24.240\n That's interesting.\n\n1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:28.200\n I mean, the scarcity of resources, wait, but I feel like that's a contradiction.\n\n1:22:28.200 --> 1:22:29.200\n I thought.\n\n1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:32.120\n Are you thinking neoclassical about scarcity?\n\n1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:37.480\n I'm barely thinking at all.\n\n1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:44.120\n So wait, I thought scarcity, the best way to build on top of scarcity is a capitalist\n\n1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:45.120\n type of machine.\n\n1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:50.400\n No, this is where, again, our vision of what scarcity is, is wrong.\n\n1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:54.480\n Because and Ricardo said this, but it's actually better than Marx.\n\n1:22:54.480 --> 1:23:00.240\n Because Ricardo said, there are some products whose value is determined entirely by their\n\n1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:01.240\n scarcity.\n\n1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:02.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:08.040\n Paintings, rare wines, et cetera, et cetera, they are things you cannot reproduce in a\n\n1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:09.040\n factory.\n\n1:23:09.040 --> 1:23:12.780\n He said, the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory.\n\n1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:19.960\n And therefore, for these unique objects, these rare objects, Picasso painting a beautiful\n\n1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:25.860\n bottle of wine, et cetera, et cetera, then the utility, it can't be reproduced easily.\n\n1:23:25.860 --> 1:23:28.520\n So its price will be determined by subjective valuation.\n\n1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:33.160\n He said, what we're talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make en masse.\n\n1:23:33.160 --> 1:23:37.680\n And that is the true focus of the capitalist economy.\n\n1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:39.040\n And that is not about scarcity.\n\n1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:43.920\n That is about, the only scarcity applies when you don't have the resources to make them\n\n1:23:43.920 --> 1:23:48.880\n anymore or you can't use the energy involved because you'll damage the biosphere too much,\n\n1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:50.800\n which we've already done.\n\n1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:55.880\n But fundamentally, the scarcity that neoclassicals have been able to think about and Austrians\n\n1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:59.040\n think about as well is nonreproducible.\n\n1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:03.140\n But the essence of capitalism is the commodity, the backscratcher, the two buck backscratcher,\n\n1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:06.920\n anybody can, you know, the cheapest chips to make, and that's why it can make a profit\n\n1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:09.020\n out of them.\n\n1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:13.460\n Not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets.\n\n1:24:13.460 --> 1:24:19.600\n So we think our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals analyzing the exception\n\n1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.200\n to capitalism and calling it capitalism.\n\n1:24:22.200 --> 1:24:23.200\n Okay.\n\n1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:24.200\n Fair enough.\n\n1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:29.720\n So, you know, let's put Mars aside because I think there's a lot of strange factors that\n\n1:24:29.720 --> 1:24:37.360\n have to do with a whole nother planet, civilization, that we don't quite understand.\n\n1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:47.120\n Think how economics works with different geographic locations, one of which have new challenges,\n\n1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:48.200\n which is what essentially this is.\n\n1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:50.800\n I don't know if you can apply the same economic theory.\n\n1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:55.560\n No, I'm saying your question, I think we'll be forced into that ultimately by having to\n\n1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:58.380\n make a compromise with the ecology.\n\n1:24:58.380 --> 1:25:02.080\n And we've been ruthless about the ecology of this planet, and we're going to pay the\n\n1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:03.660\n price for it.\n\n1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:11.520\n So if you have a planet where you can't be ruthless, okay, you have to mind it as carefully\n\n1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:19.000\n as possible, then that utopian might be imposed upon you for the needs for survival on that\n\n1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:20.000\n planet.\n\n1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:25.520\n Back here, Marx's utopia was still the one that ignored the ecology.\n\n1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:31.740\n And I think if I have a vision of a utopia in future, it's got bugger all to do about\n\n1:25:31.740 --> 1:25:34.120\n what humans get out of it.\n\n1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:36.280\n It's what humans respect.\n\n1:25:36.280 --> 1:25:38.040\n They have to respect life.\n\n1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:44.940\n So I see that as a one eyed utopia, a utopia for a single species, as if it can exist on\n\n1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:47.800\n its own, which we should know it can't.\n\n1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:48.800\n Quick bathroom break?\n\n1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:51.340\n Yeah, that would be great.\n\n1:25:51.340 --> 1:25:54.520\n We took a little bit of a break and now we're back.\n\n1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:58.600\n We needed to take a break because my brain broke and I'm piecing it back together.\n\n1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.240\n You mentioned ecology and life and the value of all of that.\n\n1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:05.080\n We'll return to it if we can.\n\n1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:16.320\n But first, we said why this kind of, this idea of why socialism failed, can we linger\n\n1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:23.520\n on this a little bit longer in how did the ideas of Karl Marx lead to Stalinism?\n\n1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:31.800\n So this particular implementation, is there something fundamental to these ideas that\n\n1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.720\n leads to a dictator and that leads to atrocities?\n\n1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:43.680\n There's something about the mechanism of the bureaucracy that's built that leads to a human\n\n1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:53.480\n being that's able to attain, integrate absolute power and then start abusing that power?\n\n1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:54.480\n All that kind of stuff.\n\n1:26:54.480 --> 1:27:00.560\n Like some of the history of the 20th century, is that inextricably connected to the ideas\n\n1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:01.560\n of Karl Marx?\n\n1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:05.240\n I think to some extent it is, but I'm going to also say that if it hadn't been for the\n\n1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:09.880\n Bolsheviks interpreting Marx and saying we can reach socialism without going through\n\n1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:15.480\n capitalism, then it might not have happened.\n\n1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:22.120\n So if you look at the, like the Mensheviks were a rival political group in Russia and\n\n1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:24.680\n that's where Hyman Minsky, who's a huge inspiration for me.\n\n1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:29.440\n So he's an economist who was maybe, can we take a little attention, who was Hyman Minsky?\n\n1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:30.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:30.440 --> 1:27:36.600\n Hyman Minsky was the person who developed an analysis of capitalism based on financial\n\n1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.520\n instability.\n\n1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:45.720\n And he was actually the PhD student of Joseph Schumpeter and an Austrian economist as well\n\n1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:48.900\n whose name I've forgotten temporarily.\n\n1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:57.640\n And he asked him, his parents were both refugees from Russia during the Stalinist period because\n\n1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:05.240\n the Mensheviks were being wiped out in Russia, just like any other opponents to the Bolsheviks\n\n1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.960\n were being eliminated.\n\n1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:12.960\n So I think his parents met in Chicago, still remain socialist, still remain politically\n\n1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:20.800\n active, and he was educated in a family that was just imbued with Marx as his vision.\n\n1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:27.880\n He ended up fighting in the Second World War on the American side, coming back to America\n\n1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:34.640\n and studying mathematics and then also doing an economics degree leading to a PhD.\n\n1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.400\n And the question he posed for himself is what causes Great Depressions?\n\n1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:44.840\n And he put it beautifully, he said, can it happen again, it being the Great Depression?\n\n1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:50.560\n And if it can't happen, then what has changed between the society before the First and Second\n\n1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:54.120\n World War and after that makes a depression impossible?\n\n1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.440\n What's the answer to those two questions?\n\n1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:57.440\n Can it happen again?\n\n1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:02.520\n His answer was yes, it can happen again, but what has prevented it happening by the time\n\n1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:10.000\n he started writing about it, which was the late 50s to the mid 80s, late 80s.\n\n1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:11.840\n We met once, but only once.\n\n1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:13.520\n Over a beer?\n\n1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:14.520\n Over a beer?\n\n1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:18.800\n No, he gave a seminar at New South Uni and he's a bit of an obstreperous bastard.\n\n1:29:18.800 --> 1:29:19.800\n What?\n\n1:29:19.800 --> 1:29:20.800\n A stripper?\n\n1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:21.800\n Obstreperous.\n\n1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:22.800\n Wow.\n\n1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:23.800\n What is it?\n\n1:29:23.800 --> 1:29:26.520\n It means argumentative and likely to dismiss you.\n\n1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:29.880\n So like a good mate of mine was the guy who brought him out to Australia, a guy called\n\n1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:30.880\n Graham White.\n\n1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:31.880\n G'day, Graham.\n\n1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:32.880\n We're still good mates.\n\n1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:33.880\n G'day, Graham.\n\n1:29:33.880 --> 1:29:35.800\n I love your language and your accent.\n\n1:29:35.800 --> 1:29:36.800\n It's a great...\n\n1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:40.520\n Actually, there's a really good TikTok I saw earlier today with an Aboriginal guy saying\n\n1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:43.400\n he loves the Australian language because it's absolutely ironic.\n\n1:29:43.400 --> 1:29:47.560\n You ask an Australian a question and he'll give you an answer, which is the opposite\n\n1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:50.080\n of what he means, and you've got to work out the rest for yourself.\n\n1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:51.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:51.080 --> 1:29:53.200\n So he goes up to another Aboriginal mate and says, G'day, mate.\n\n1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:54.200\n He says, how are you?\n\n1:29:54.200 --> 1:29:55.200\n Oh, not bad.\n\n1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:56.200\n What have you been doing recently?\n\n1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:57.200\n Oh, not much.\n\n1:29:57.200 --> 1:29:58.200\n When are we going?\n\n1:29:58.200 --> 1:29:59.200\n Not too far?\n\n1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:00.200\n Not too soon?\n\n1:30:00.200 --> 1:30:01.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:02.200\n Where is it?\n\n1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:03.200\n Oh, not too far away?\n\n1:30:03.200 --> 1:30:04.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:05.200\n All negatives.\n\n1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:07.200\n And he's a beautiful, beautiful rendition.\n\n1:30:07.200 --> 1:30:08.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:10.760\n Yeah, that's the cool thing about the internet culture.\n\n1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:13.360\n They appreciate that ironic side.\n\n1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:17.480\n Like for example, the best compliment you can give as an Aboriginal to somebody else\n\n1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:18.480\n is that's deadly.\n\n1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:19.480\n That's deadly.\n\n1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:20.480\n That's a compliment.\n\n1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:21.480\n That's deadly.\n\n1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:22.480\n Okay.\n\n1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:23.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:24.480\n I've got another mate of mine and this comes to the Australian language.\n\n1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:26.480\n If I call you a bastard, that's a compliment.\n\n1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:27.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:29.480\n Depending on how I insinuate the word bastard.\n\n1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:30.480\n Bastard.\n\n1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:31.480\n Bastard.\n\n1:30:31.480 --> 1:30:32.480\n Bastard.\n\n1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:33.480\n That's deadly.\n\n1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:34.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:35.480\n I love that.\n\n1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:40.480\n And there's something, unfortunately, there's something about the British accent that makes\n\n1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:47.840\n people sound maybe brilliant, maybe sophisticated, wise.\n\n1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:48.840\n But actually pompous.\n\n1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:49.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:55.760\n No, that's unfortunately the downside of that is you can sound pompous.\n\n1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:03.200\n There's something about the Australian accent that you just can't sound brilliant.\n\n1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:04.400\n It humbles you.\n\n1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:06.720\n You sound like you're having a lot of fun.\n\n1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.720\n There's wit.\n\n1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:08.720\n There's all that good stuff.\n\n1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:09.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:09.720 --> 1:31:10.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:10.720 --> 1:31:13.720\n But you just can't be like Karl Marx in an Australian accent would just not come off.\n\n1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:14.720\n That is a very good point.\n\n1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:16.200\n He would not be able to pull off the beard.\n\n1:31:16.200 --> 1:31:17.200\n That's like, yeah.\n\n1:31:17.200 --> 1:31:18.640\n I mean, I just, yeah.\n\n1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:25.740\n It's fascinating that the accent determines something about the person.\n\n1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:27.640\n Maybe it's the chicken and the egg too.\n\n1:31:27.640 --> 1:31:29.640\n It drives the way of the discourse.\n\n1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:30.640\n Obviously there's a lot of brilliance.\n\n1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:33.920\n There's a lot of brilliance in your work, but it sounds like you're always having fun.\n\n1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:34.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:38.280\n And look, this, Pat Poncho has got a lot of Australian mates here.\n\n1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:39.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:41.280\n He spent, what about, how long in Australia?\n\n1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:42.280\n Year and a half.\n\n1:31:42.280 --> 1:31:43.280\n Year and a half.\n\n1:31:43.280 --> 1:31:46.040\n And he's got all these mates here who play Aussie rules football in Austin.\n\n1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:47.240\n You should join them one day.\n\n1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:48.240\n I will.\n\n1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:50.520\n It's actually, it's a very creative sport.\n\n1:31:50.520 --> 1:31:51.520\n It's much more fun.\n\n1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:52.520\n It's different than rugby?\n\n1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:53.520\n Oh, very.\n\n1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:54.520\n Rugby is hopeless.\n\n1:31:54.520 --> 1:31:58.640\n Rugby is two morons smashing their bodies against each other.\n\n1:31:58.640 --> 1:31:59.640\n Easy now.\n\n1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:00.640\n Easy now.\n\n1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:01.640\n Sorry.\n\n1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:02.640\n Sorry.\n\n1:32:02.640 --> 1:32:04.280\n We did not mean to offend the rugby fans in the audience.\n\n1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:05.280\n Well, okay.\n\n1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:07.520\n What's, so it's too simplistic.\n\n1:32:07.520 --> 1:32:08.520\n It's too simplistic.\n\n1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:09.520\n It's easy.\n\n1:32:09.520 --> 1:32:10.520\n It's, I mean, there's skill in it.\n\n1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:14.400\n I've seen some really skillful rugby union and rugby league players in my day.\n\n1:32:14.400 --> 1:32:15.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:18.360\n But it, fundamentally, if you hit somebody hard enough, they go down.\n\n1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:19.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:20.360\n Okay.\n\n1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:23.520\n Whereas in Aussie rules, it's about catching the ball and then kicking the ball and pass.\n\n1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:24.520\n More skill, less pass.\n\n1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:25.520\n More skill.\n\n1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:31.080\n And it's, and the bodies of the athletes, I can actually get off and measure what a sport\n\n1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:33.040\n is like by the bodies it creates.\n\n1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:39.040\n And you get these incredibly elegant lithe muscular forms out of Aussie rules.\n\n1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.960\n Such beautiful words you have in your vocabulary, lithe, I don't even know.\n\n1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.480\n But I'll assume you know what it means and maybe somebody in the audience.\n\n1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:48.480\n Okay.\n\n1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:51.160\n So, all right, fine, fine.\n\n1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:58.320\n We should also mention that you, in your youth, you know, like last year, have had Olympic\n\n1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:01.080\n weightlifting as part of your life.\n\n1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:02.080\n So you're...\n\n1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.080\n A long time ago.\n\n1:33:03.080 --> 1:33:04.080\n And like you said, tennis.\n\n1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:06.240\n I also played tennis for many, many, many, many years.\n\n1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:07.240\n Okay.\n\n1:33:07.240 --> 1:33:08.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:09.240\n It's a fascinating game.\n\n1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:10.240\n It's a wonderful game.\n\n1:33:10.240 --> 1:33:11.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:15.560\n That's my favorite game.\n\n1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:17.680\n Karl Marx and Stalin.\n\n1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:18.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:22.840\n So how do we get onto Aussie football in Australia and the accent?\n\n1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:27.280\n I'm not really sure you talked about the way I said something about Karl Marx and with\n\n1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:28.280\n Karl Marx.\n\n1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:29.280\n Anyway, we got there.\n\n1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:30.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:31.560\n We got there and now we return.\n\n1:33:31.560 --> 1:33:32.560\n But back to Marx.\n\n1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:33.560\n I think...\n\n1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:34.560\n It's not the destination.\n\n1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:35.560\n It's the journey.\n\n1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:40.280\n I think Marx, the failure of socialism with Janos Kornei captured beautifully.\n\n1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:44.800\n This idea already called demand constrained versus resource constrained economies.\n\n1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:47.800\n And capitalism is demand constrained.\n\n1:33:47.800 --> 1:33:48.800\n Okay.\n\n1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:52.560\n And this is, again, where neoclassical theory is completely wrong, empirically completely\n\n1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:53.560\n wrong.\n\n1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:58.040\n So the neoclassicals have a vision of capitalism being resource constrained, and it's about\n\n1:33:58.040 --> 1:34:02.680\n maximizing your usage of resources subject to constraints.\n\n1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.440\n And as Kornei said, that's really what happened to socialism.\n\n1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:12.760\n What happens under capitalism is that you have 15, 20 companies producing automobiles.\n\n1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:15.680\n They are all trying to capture as much of the market as they can.\n\n1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:20.840\n If you add up their marketing plans, you're going to get 120, 130% of the actual market.\n\n1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:23.080\n So they're all going to have excess capacity.\n\n1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.080\n When you build a factory, you're building it with a plan for it to exist for five, 10,\n\n1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:28.080\n 15 years.\n\n1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:30.420\n You have to have excess capacity in the factory.\n\n1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:35.560\n So that means that capitalism has far greater productive capacity than it actually uses.\n\n1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:39.640\n And then the way that you manage to get demand into your factories to innovate and produce\n\n1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:44.480\n something nobody else does, or you're producing in volume and when somebody produces like\n\n1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:49.240\n a bung tire, comes out of Firestone, then Goodyear is ready to expand its production\n\n1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:50.940\n and take advantage of that.\n\n1:34:50.940 --> 1:34:54.360\n So that's the actual nature of competition in capitalism.\n\n1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:59.240\n And that means that we get a cornucopia of goods, even if we're lowly workers.\n\n1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:05.040\n The variety of goods in capitalism is overwhelming, and that just doesn't happen in socialism.\n\n1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:09.040\n You get your 1942 Cossack as your motorbike, that's it.\n\n1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:13.640\n When you put your money down to buy a refrigerator, it'll arrive in 10 years because the factory's\n\n1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:15.640\n already fully constrained.\n\n1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:21.480\n So all these resource constraints mean that people aren't happy under socialism.\n\n1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:26.600\n And if you've got a whole bunch of people that aren't happy, then the best way to control\n\n1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:29.020\n them is to suppress them.\n\n1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:33.040\n So I think in that sense, ultimately, yes, it does lead to something like Stalinism.\n\n1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:36.480\n So it's easier to give happy people freedom.\n\n1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:39.600\n Yeah, I mean, happy people get pretty silly outside.\n\n1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.800\n I'm not particularly, the extent to which Americans overuse and distort the word freedom\n\n1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:47.680\n drives me balmy.\n\n1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:52.800\n All of these words can be distorted, but they all, at the core, have some fundamental power\n\n1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:57.620\n and beauty, and then we just distort on the surface for the fun of it, just to start battles\n\n1:35:57.620 --> 1:35:59.160\n on Twitter and so on.\n\n1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:02.880\n But what citizens of the Soviet world didn't feel was freedom.\n\n1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:06.400\n Not just in, first of all, it wasn't freedom to buy commodities.\n\n1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:09.640\n The commodities that were supposed to be on the shops weren't there.\n\n1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:11.440\n The volume couldn't be produced.\n\n1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.720\n And what you then got out of that as well was the classic Soviet joke, they pretend\n\n1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:17.520\n to pay us and we pretend to work.\n\n1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:18.520\n Okay.\n\n1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:20.320\n Yeah, so you're not motivated.\n\n1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:26.120\n Oh, look, I went to Cuba about eight years ago, invited to give a talk there.\n\n1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:28.920\n And staying in a hotel itself, the hotel's a story.\n\n1:36:28.920 --> 1:36:33.700\n There was one day my meetings were canceled, so I thought I might go down to the beach.\n\n1:36:33.700 --> 1:36:38.120\n And in the hotel, they had a wing, which is the tourist office, and there were three women\n\n1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:39.120\n working inside the office.\n\n1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.720\n So I thought I'd just go up and ask them, you know, how do I get to the beach?\n\n1:36:42.720 --> 1:36:48.640\n And one of them says to me, and I stood there, just stood in the room, waiting to see if\n\n1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.560\n they'd make eye contact with me.\n\n1:36:50.560 --> 1:36:52.760\n Three women, nobody else in the place.\n\n1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:53.760\n None of them looked at me.\n\n1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:57.640\n So I finally went up to one of them and said, I want to go to the beach and do some surfing\n\n1:36:57.640 --> 1:36:58.640\n work.\n\n1:36:58.640 --> 1:36:59.640\n She said, I can get a taxi outside.\n\n1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:05.600\n Now, fundamentally, she was saying, well, I'm being paid shit money here, I don't want\n\n1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:13.080\n to work, I'm not going to do anything apart from sit here and qualify for my time.\n\n1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:16.640\n And as much as there are reasons the Cubans have suffered from American embargoes and\n\n1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:22.360\n all that sort of stuff, you've still got that fundamental shortage economy that Cornet spoke\n\n1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:27.880\n about coming out of the structure of central ownership and central control of distribution\n\n1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:28.880\n and investment.\n\n1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:35.000\n It breaks my heart because I think some of the effects of that persist throughout time.\n\n1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.600\n It become part of the culture too.\n\n1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:37.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:38.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:39.600\n It's very interesting.\n\n1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:40.600\n Negative culture.\n\n1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:41.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:42.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:43.600\n Well, from the Western perspective.\n\n1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:44.720\n Well, even from the people living through it.\n\n1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:49.400\n I mean, I had enough conversation with Cubans, you know, meeting them on the street, hopping\n\n1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:50.400\n in a cab.\n\n1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.600\n There was one guy I was talking to, he was an industrial chemist and he'd got a bit of\n\n1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:59.840\n money being a cab driver because he could make money out of taking foreign tourists\n\n1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:01.560\n from the airport to the city.\n\n1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:06.480\n By the way, this episode is brought to you by delicious Coca Cola.\n\n1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:10.520\n That's why I didn't want to have it on camera, but anyway.\n\n1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:12.000\n No, maybe they'll actually sponsor.\n\n1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.120\n You want to make sure you rotate the label to show, this is capitalism.\n\n1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.400\n What are we talking about here?\n\n1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:19.400\n Even though it's red.\n\n1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:24.280\n Red and black is actually anarchist.\n\n1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:27.240\n I should tell you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malice is.\n\n1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:28.240\n Michael.\n\n1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:29.240\n Michael Malice.\n\n1:38:29.240 --> 1:38:30.880\n He's an anarchist and he lives next door.\n\n1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:31.880\n Does he?\n\n1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:32.880\n Okay.\n\n1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:34.920\n Now, I've lost touch with anarchist philosophy.\n\n1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:40.560\n I actually used to read, you know, Kropotkin and Bakunin and so on, and I enjoyed their\n\n1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:44.800\n philosophy and then I helped organize an anarchist conference once, and that was the\n\n1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.440\n biggest antidote possible to being an anarchist.\n\n1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:53.480\n That sounds like an entry point to a joke, helped to organize an anarchist party.\n\n1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:54.480\n It is.\n\n1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:59.520\n I mean, we literally spent three days arguing over whether there should or should not be\n\n1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:01.880\n a chairperson for conversations.\n\n1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:02.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.080\n Well, that may be that.\n\n1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:12.880\n Monty Python's Life of Brian lived out live.\n\n1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:15.160\n Look at the bright side of life.\n\n1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:16.160\n All right.\n\n1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.680\n So part of that explains why, for example, even to this day, in some of those parts of\n\n1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:26.480\n the world, entrepreneurship does not flourish.\n\n1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.720\n There's not a spirit in the people to start businesses, to launch new endeavors and all\n\n1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:33.560\n those kinds of things.\n\n1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:40.560\n We're just taking all kinds of strange little strolls, but how do you explain the mechanisms\n\n1:39:40.560 --> 1:39:47.720\n of China today, where there's quite a bit of sort of flourishing of businesses and so\n\n1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:48.720\n on?\n\n1:39:48.720 --> 1:39:51.240\n It's a very peculiar kind of entrepreneurship.\n\n1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:57.200\n They got away from central control, but they still manage central political control, but\n\n1:39:57.200 --> 1:39:59.360\n diversified economic control.\n\n1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.280\n So you could, it is possible to draw a line between politics and economics.\n\n1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:06.560\n It is possible, and I think in some ways, China's more likely to survive as a society\n\n1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:12.360\n going into the future than Western capitalist societies are.\n\n1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:22.440\n So it's like, if we do the Karl Marx, the foreground and the background, you can centralize\n\n1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:31.200\n the politics, the humanity, the subjective stuff, and then distribute the objective stuff.\n\n1:40:31.200 --> 1:40:38.040\n You've got to have the goods, and the big change from Mao Zedong Xiaoping was the characterizing\n\n1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:41.880\n that little saying that I don't care whether you have a black cat or a white cat, so long\n\n1:40:41.880 --> 1:40:44.000\n as it catches mice.\n\n1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:49.360\n And there was a level of pragmatism to the Deng Xiaoping revolution over Mao and Madame\n\n1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:55.280\n Mao in particular, and that was manifest in the desire to get as much of those Western\n\n1:40:55.280 --> 1:40:56.960\n goods as possible.\n\n1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:01.320\n And I was actually in China in 1981, took a group of journalists there, as I mentioned\n\n1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:07.920\n earlier, for a tour, and we ended up going to the Sichuan Free Trade Zone, and that gave\n\n1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:15.280\n us an idea of why China was going to succeed, because they had a rule that you couldn't\n\n1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.440\n just come in and exploit the cheap wages, you had to also have a Chinese partner, and\n\n1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:25.240\n within five years, the Chinese partner had to earn 50 percent of the business, which\n\n1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:26.240\n is huge.\n\n1:41:26.240 --> 1:41:30.480\n And that gives you an idea of the reduction in wages these American corporations were\n\n1:41:30.480 --> 1:41:31.480\n looking at.\n\n1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:35.380\n They'd shut down the factory in what's now the Rust Belt of America that might be paying\n\n1:41:35.380 --> 1:41:41.360\n somebody there at that time maybe $2 an hour, and they come across to China and they're\n\n1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:43.560\n paying two cents an hour.\n\n1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:49.160\n So the enormous amount of wages that they dropped, they were willing to forego half\n\n1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:52.200\n the profits and the ownership of the firm.\n\n1:41:52.200 --> 1:41:57.360\n So what the Chinese were doing wasn't just exploiting their labor force, it was also\n\n1:41:57.360 --> 1:42:02.400\n building a capitalist class, and that meant that you had this, that's where all the Chinese\n\n1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:04.280\n corporations have come from.\n\n1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:11.240\n So they were building a capitalist system within a socialist command political system,\n\n1:42:11.240 --> 1:42:14.440\n and that worked, and it's still working.\n\n1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:18.320\n So there was the centralization of the economic stuff, the Gosplan approach.\n\n1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.920\n I think that was where the Soviets failed.\n\n1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:26.760\n And what the Chinese realized after what they went through under Mao was you have to have\n\n1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:31.060\n that capitalist period, but they weren't going to abandon the communist control politically\n\n1:42:31.060 --> 1:42:33.060\n of the country at the same time.\n\n1:42:33.060 --> 1:42:36.280\n And that worked out brilliantly, and there's a huge amount of innovation taking place in\n\n1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:38.160\n China today.\n\n1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:44.480\n And they also will do gigantic infrastructure projects, breathtaking planning going into\n\n1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:45.480\n that.\n\n1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:49.620\n You would have seen videos of building a skyscraper in a day.\n\n1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:54.280\n The planning that has to go into that, the pre preparation that's necessary is enormous.\n\n1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:57.480\n So there's a real respect for engineers as well in that society, which does not apply\n\n1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:58.480\n on the West.\n\n1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:04.760\n What do you think about, from the Western perspective, the destructive effects of centralized\n\n1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:09.880\n control of the populace, of the ideas of the discourse, of the censorship and the surveillance,\n\n1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:10.880\n all those kinds of things?\n\n1:43:10.880 --> 1:43:16.520\n It's a bit like we were talking about Russia to some extent beforehand, with centralized\n\n1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:21.040\n versus decentralized corruption.\n\n1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:27.200\n And when you had the centralized political stuff, it means you know you can't criticize\n\n1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:28.600\n within China.\n\n1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:31.760\n But so long as you don't criticize, you can do what you like.\n\n1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:35.160\n And how destructive is that to the human spirit?\n\n1:43:35.160 --> 1:43:39.200\n From the American perspective, that feels destructive.\n\n1:43:39.200 --> 1:43:45.260\n I've been to China quite a few times over my life, a lot in the last, not for about\n\n1:43:45.260 --> 1:43:48.960\n four years, but for the six years before that, a few visits.\n\n1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:55.680\n And staying in second and third and fourth tier cities, so populations of only four million\n\n1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.080\n people, which is quite small on Chinese standards.\n\n1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:02.240\n And I had a lot of happy people that I was interacting with.\n\n1:44:02.240 --> 1:44:06.400\n My girlfriend at the time, her social circle.\n\n1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:09.800\n And you can feel when people can't discuss a political issue.\n\n1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:13.040\n For example, in Thailand, you can't discuss the king.\n\n1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:18.480\n They still have, you know, les majestes laws, so you can actually be jailed for discussing\n\n1:44:18.480 --> 1:44:19.480\n the king.\n\n1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:24.280\n And you can feel that to some extent, and it is a political issue in Thailand now.\n\n1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:31.080\n But in China, what I got back from most people, it was a bit like a benevolent big brother.\n\n1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:34.760\n But then when you get things out like the lockdown, which was applied recently, then\n\n1:44:34.760 --> 1:44:40.940\n you get the failings of the Soviet system is still there in the Chinese system.\n\n1:44:40.940 --> 1:44:47.680\n In that, the easiest way to avoid criticism as an underling carrying out instructions\n\n1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:54.200\n of people above you is to carry those instructions out to the letter beyond what the people actually\n\n1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:56.120\n want you to do at the top.\n\n1:44:56.120 --> 1:45:00.320\n So we had a classic illustration of that when I took these journalists.\n\n1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:06.220\n There was a news report saying that China's output of light industry had grown by 17 percent\n\n1:45:06.220 --> 1:45:10.240\n in the previous year, but heavy industry had fallen by 7 percent.\n\n1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:12.560\n We just don't compute.\n\n1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:14.460\n So we kept on asking, why did this happen?\n\n1:45:14.460 --> 1:45:18.400\n Every time we asked a question, this is back in 1981, the answer would be the initial answer,\n\n1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:23.380\n we followed the directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.\n\n1:45:23.380 --> 1:45:26.220\n We finally got a guy to elaborate and say what that was.\n\n1:45:26.220 --> 1:45:30.580\n He said, well, the Central Committee sent out a directive to promote light industry.\n\n1:45:30.580 --> 1:45:31.800\n So what did you do?\n\n1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:37.620\n Quote unquote, we stripped heavy industry factories and turned them into light industry.\n\n1:45:37.620 --> 1:45:40.400\n Now that's destructive of everything.\n\n1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.360\n And that's the overlay that you've still got sitting over the top of China.\n\n1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:50.920\n But a huge part of the industrialization was simply saying, produce whatever you can, make\n\n1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:53.580\n goods, market them, sell them.\n\n1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:59.760\n And you get that innovative component of humanity is respected and the goods turn up and everybody's\n\n1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:00.760\n well fed.\n\n1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:04.600\n Food in Russia is far better than food in America.\n\n1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:12.600\n So in terms of material satisfaction and freedom, for example, enjoy dancing.\n\n1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:19.080\n We went to, I think, somewhere in Shanghai, and there's this line of people involving\n\n1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:24.440\n a woman who would have been close to her 90s and a kid who was about six or four.\n\n1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:25.440\n Partying it up?\n\n1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:27.840\n Partying it up in the open air and doing this Chinese collective dance.\n\n1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:31.520\n You have to be really careful about that kind of thing.\n\n1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:44.640\n So in terms of measuring the flourishing of a people by looking at their happiness, I\n\n1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:48.480\n have so many thoughts on this, but I'm imagining North Korea.\n\n1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:55.720\n And if you talk to people in North Korea, I think they would say they're happy.\n\n1:46:55.720 --> 1:46:56.720\n No.\n\n1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:04.280\n Well, let me try to complete this argument, not an argument, but a sort of challenge to\n\n1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:12.720\n your thought, which especially in the bigger cities, because they don't know the alternative.\n\n1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:14.520\n So what else do you need?\n\n1:47:14.520 --> 1:47:16.520\n There's enough food on the table.\n\n1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:22.280\n We have a leader that loves us and we love him.\n\n1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:24.360\n Our hearts are full of love.\n\n1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:33.580\n Our table is full of food, they would say, because it's enough food.\n\n1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:34.720\n What else do you want from life?\n\n1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:36.360\n No, I think, okay, like that's...\n\n1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:38.160\n So let me sort of chat, because like...\n\n1:47:38.160 --> 1:47:39.160\n That's an alternative.\n\n1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:41.580\n I mean, I've spent time in Romania.\n\n1:47:41.580 --> 1:47:44.240\n So let me sort of complete that, sorry.\n\n1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:47.520\n Because I'm taking the most challenging aspect.\n\n1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:53.600\n When there's centralized control of information, that you don't know the alternative, that\n\n1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:57.000\n you don't know how green the grass is on the other side.\n\n1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:00.960\n And so your idea of happiness might be very constrained.\n\n1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:06.680\n So you could also argue that is happiness, if you don't know.\n\n1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:07.680\n Ignorance is bliss.\n\n1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:08.680\n Ignorance is bliss.\n\n1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:13.800\n And then so is happiness really the correct measure for the flourishing?\n\n1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:14.800\n It's not.\n\n1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:22.560\n But I mean, there's actually a classic book, a movie as well, called Mao's Last Dancer.\n\n1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:28.720\n And that is a young man explaining his progression from being a dancer in the Cultural Revolution\n\n1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:33.720\n through to a leading dancer in American and ultimately Australian ballet.\n\n1:48:33.720 --> 1:48:39.200\n And he explicitly says at one point that he's told that the Chinese people have the highest\n\n1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:41.120\n standard of living in the world.\n\n1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.680\n And the reaction of him and his kids, like his fellow six year olds, is, God, it must\n\n1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:47.440\n be miserable elsewhere in the world then.\n\n1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:48.440\n So they knew.\n\n1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:49.440\n They still know.\n\n1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:50.440\n They still know.\n\n1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:52.620\n There's no such thing as that complete ignorance.\n\n1:48:52.620 --> 1:49:01.120\n But what I'm talking about is experiences in China say back in about 2016, 2014, there\n\n1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:07.360\n was a feeling of freedom within limits that you didn't want to transgress because the\n\n1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:09.360\n system was working.\n\n1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:13.240\n So if you like, it's kind of like marriage, it's kind of like marriage, hey, that's a\n\n1:49:13.240 --> 1:49:14.240\n good example.\n\n1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:15.240\n There's limits.\n\n1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:16.240\n There's limits.\n\n1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:18.000\n You can have fun within those limits.\n\n1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:19.000\n That's right.\n\n1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:20.000\n Okay.\n\n1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:24.160\n And people did have fun and they did feel free, but they didn't want to go and get divorced.\n\n1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:30.040\n But that dilemma was accommodated because the boundaries, until you started hitting\n\n1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:32.240\n restrictions were wide.\n\n1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:33.240\n Okay.\n\n1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.000\n And like when you look at it, I mean, look at the, again, with the Chinese Communist\n\n1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:43.240\n Party, the administrators of that are often highly qualified engineers who can then make\n\n1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:47.720\n intelligent decisions about what should be done as infrastructure and so on.\n\n1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:54.520\n And you go to China and you've got incredible high speed rail, fantastic infrastructure,\n\n1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:59.800\n internet, telecommunications and so on, rapidly evolving solar.\n\n1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:06.240\n There's a range of things there that are so well done that reflect the fact that the selection\n\n1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.600\n process that gives you your political elite is partially focused upon sucking up, et cetera,\n\n1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.600\n et cetera.\n\n1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:16.840\n It's still there, but it's also focused upon your skill levels.\n\n1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:20.560\n And you get people making decisions who damn well know what they're talking about.\n\n1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:25.000\n Like Australia's got a classic example, the internet in Australia sucks.\n\n1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:31.840\n The reason it sucks is that the Labour Party, which is our version of the Democrats, was\n\n1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:34.560\n in control during the global financial crisis.\n\n1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:41.600\n And as part of that, they wanted to bring in optical fiber connections to the house.\n\n1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:48.400\n So you'd have an optical fiber backbone and an optical fiber right to your T100 output\n\n1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:49.760\n from your home.\n\n1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:54.360\n And the Liberal Party fought that and said, that's going to be too expensive, it'd take\n\n1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:55.700\n too long to do.\n\n1:50:55.700 --> 1:51:01.240\n We're going to do cable to the node and then have a copper network linking from a node\n\n1:51:01.240 --> 1:51:03.520\n on a street to all the houses in the street.\n\n1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:07.040\n It's going to be cheaper and faster, have it more soon, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:09.840\n It was a total technical fuck up.\n\n1:51:09.840 --> 1:51:13.880\n And Australia now has internet that's about 50 or 60 years fast in the world.\n\n1:51:13.880 --> 1:51:16.040\n It's dreadful for the internet.\n\n1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:22.880\n Two political figures made that decision, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, rivals and\n\n1:51:22.880 --> 1:51:27.880\n leaders of the Conservative Party we call Liberal over there.\n\n1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:34.560\n Now that was shitty decisions that wouldn't happen in a country like China because you've\n\n1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.720\n got actual engineers making the decisions.\n\n1:51:36.720 --> 1:51:42.360\n They say you can't get decent speed if you link optical fiber to copper.\n\n1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:48.400\n So what you get is even though you can't make the decisions yourself, a vast majority of\n\n1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:52.320\n the decisions are made intelligently and therefore you expect it.\n\n1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:59.240\n It's interesting, but don't you worry about the corrupting aspects of power?\n\n1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:00.240\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.000\n That you start, you know, you have engineers making intelligent decisions, but at which\n\n1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:11.640\n point does the fat king start saying, oh, these engineers are annoying.\n\n1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:12.760\n I have good internet.\n\n1:52:12.760 --> 1:52:14.360\n I don't understand.\n\n1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:15.360\n Bring me the grapes.\n\n1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:18.640\n Well, that's, you know, you get your colligular effects.\n\n1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:19.640\n That can happen.\n\n1:52:19.640 --> 1:52:22.280\n Like Z from what I've seen has got elements of that.\n\n1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:26.480\n So friends of mine who are Caucasians can get away with it.\n\n1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.080\n They have a game that they play at conferences, scoring how often people use with Z's name\n\n1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:35.000\n in a presentation and giving extra points for the number of photographs of Z that turn\n\n1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.360\n up in the whole thing.\n\n1:52:36.360 --> 1:52:40.200\n So you've got this sort of personality cult coming along as well.\n\n1:52:40.200 --> 1:52:44.720\n But at the same time, the planning for the infrastructure that's being built, the social\n\n1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:50.240\n services, the general freedom that exists is so great.\n\n1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:56.200\n And like any Chinese person alive today, like somebody who's Chinese my age, would have\n\n1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:02.440\n been an adult under the early period of, the late period of Mao.\n\n1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:05.900\n And God almighty, the change, the improvement they've seen in their lives, that's what they\n\n1:53:05.900 --> 1:53:06.900\n think about.\n\n1:53:06.900 --> 1:53:07.900\n So.\n\n1:53:07.900 --> 1:53:13.820\n But it's the, if you just look at the history of the 20th century, your intuition would\n\n1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:18.360\n say that some of the mechanisms we see in China now will get you into trouble in the\n\n1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:19.760\n long term.\n\n1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:25.640\n So it seems to be working really well in many ways in terms of improving the quality of\n\n1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:30.280\n life of the average citizen in China, but you start to get worried about how does this\n\n1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:31.280\n go wrong?\n\n1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:32.280\n Well, yeah.\n\n1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:35.600\n But at the same time, maybe, I mean, often people will say, you know, what's your vision\n\n1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:36.600\n for the future?\n\n1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:40.680\n And what they mean is what vision for the future do you have that I'm going to like?\n\n1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:41.680\n Right.\n\n1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:42.680\n Okay.\n\n1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:45.560\n What if you have a vision of the future that you don't like?\n\n1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:46.560\n It's dreadful.\n\n1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:52.080\n I mean, that's the ecological crisis I think we're walking blindfolded into.\n\n1:53:52.080 --> 1:53:54.880\n Well, that's right.\n\n1:53:54.880 --> 1:54:00.000\n That part of the picture we'll have to talk about how fundamental of a problem that is.\n\n1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:01.000\n Okay.\n\n1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:02.560\n But what does that have to do with the future of China?\n\n1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:06.800\n What it has to do is that if you wish to impose dramatic controls on the consumption of the\n\n1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:13.640\n rich, which would be necessary to reduce our consumption burden so that we can get closer\n\n1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:19.080\n to the ecological envelope we've destroyed already, then you're going to make more likely\n\n1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:24.280\n successful doing that with a centralized system where people accept centralized political\n\n1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:25.280\n control.\n\n1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:29.760\n Then you're in a country where it's all diversified and you scream freedom between every point\n\n1:54:29.760 --> 1:54:30.760\n in a tennis match.\n\n1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:35.340\n And I've literally seen that when I was in Philadelphia some time back.\n\n1:54:35.340 --> 1:54:41.960\n So the ideology that accepts a collectivist attitude may be more successful in controlling\n\n1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:44.520\n our reducing human consumption levels.\n\n1:54:44.520 --> 1:54:49.280\n Because when we talk about democracy, I mean, who's voting here?\n\n1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:56.120\n How many horses and elephants and birds get to vote?\n\n1:54:56.120 --> 1:54:57.120\n It's very...\n\n1:54:57.120 --> 1:54:58.120\n What's a bird?\n\n1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:59.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:01.200\n You don't see them around here.\n\n1:55:01.200 --> 1:55:04.840\n It's a very human centric vision we have of this planet.\n\n1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:07.160\n And we're going to pay a price for that.\n\n1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:08.160\n Okay.\n\n1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:14.800\n So you're saying to deal with global catastrophic events, centralized planning might be...\n\n1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:18.760\n I think will work better, period.\n\n1:55:18.760 --> 1:55:22.440\n But there is some centralized stuff in the United States, for example.\n\n1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:23.440\n Oh, your military.\n\n1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:24.440\n Yeah, I know.\n\n1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:25.440\n No, no.\n\n1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:26.440\n Okay.\n\n1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:27.440\n All right.\n\n1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:31.040\n Now there's that feisty Australian.\n\n1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:35.560\n So besides the military, that's the ideal of the federal government in the United States\n\n1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:40.680\n is that there is some centralized infrastructure building.\n\n1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:41.680\n There's some big...\n\n1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:43.240\n There's not enough of it, yeah.\n\n1:55:43.240 --> 1:55:44.240\n But there's some.\n\n1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:45.240\n There's some.\n\n1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:50.400\n The question is, when you deal with greater and greater global catastrophic events, like\n\n1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:53.480\n the pandemic that we're just living through, that the government would be able to step\n\n1:55:53.480 --> 1:56:01.400\n up and impose enough centralized planning to allow us to deal, sort of enable, empower\n\n1:56:01.400 --> 1:56:04.620\n the citizenry to deal with these catastrophic events.\n\n1:56:04.620 --> 1:56:09.200\n In the case of the pandemic, a lot of people argue that the, first of all, the world, but\n\n1:56:09.200 --> 1:56:15.640\n also the United States failed to effectively deal with the pandemic.\n\n1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:21.600\n On the medical side, on the social side, on the financial side, the supply chain, everything.\n\n1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:29.360\n In terms of communication, in terms of inspiring the populace with the power of science and\n\n1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:30.360\n all the fronts.\n\n1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:31.360\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:32.360\n They failed.\n\n1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:34.680\n But the ideal is that we'd be able to succeed.\n\n1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:38.840\n You would have to have a small, efficient, the ideal, the American ideal is you have\n\n1:56:38.840 --> 1:56:43.960\n a small, efficient government that's able to take on tasks precisely like the pandemic.\n\n1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:46.480\n But the thing is, maybe it shouldn't have been as small as it was.\n\n1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.240\n I mean, my favorite instance of that actually involves the UK because the whole neoliberal\n\n1:56:51.240 --> 1:56:53.800\n approach is about small, efficient government.\n\n1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:54.800\n Okay?\n\n1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:58.600\n Well, small, efficient government works when you face small, efficient challenges.\n\n1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:03.880\n When you face something systemic rather than episodic, then it's going to break down.\n\n1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:08.980\n And like this is, I mean, one of the things I greatly respect is Taleb's idea of antifragile.\n\n1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:13.240\n You want a society which is antifragile, not easily broken, whereas neoliberalism has pushed\n\n1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:16.480\n us towards this vision of efficiency, but it's easily snapped.\n\n1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:22.440\n Like in the UK, I've forgotten the government minister involved, but she was, she asked\n\n1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:28.160\n her expert committee, how many, this is before, well before the pandemic, how many masks should\n\n1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:31.120\n we have on hand in case of a pandemic?\n\n1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.640\n And the answer from the experts was about a billion.\n\n1:57:33.640 --> 1:57:34.640\n Okay.\n\n1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:37.680\n That's 50 masks, that's 20 masks per person.\n\n1:57:37.680 --> 1:57:38.680\n Okay.\n\n1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:39.940\n Oh, that's too many.\n\n1:57:39.940 --> 1:57:42.400\n Let's just make 50 million masks.\n\n1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:43.660\n That's one mask per person.\n\n1:57:43.660 --> 1:57:45.920\n It was gone in a matter of a day.\n\n1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:46.920\n Okay.\n\n1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:48.820\n And therefore that's why they told us, well, masks don't work.\n\n1:57:48.820 --> 1:57:53.280\n You know, what they meant was we don't have enough masks for our health people, let alone\n\n1:57:53.280 --> 1:57:54.280\n for you and the public.\n\n1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:58.120\n So we're going to bullshit you and tell you those masks don't really work.\n\n1:57:58.120 --> 1:58:01.840\n And then people don't wear masks and then we've got enough masks, we rush up the production\n\n1:58:01.840 --> 1:58:02.840\n job.\n\n1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:05.960\n And by the time it comes along, people have got the skepticism about masks.\n\n1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:10.120\n So who does, can you elaborate, who does the blame in that case go on to?\n\n1:58:10.120 --> 1:58:13.720\n The blame comes down to the philosophy that says government should always be small.\n\n1:58:13.720 --> 1:58:18.280\n No, but do you, do you really think that bigger government would be the solution to the mask\n\n1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:19.280\n issue?\n\n1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:20.280\n No.\n\n1:58:20.280 --> 1:58:21.280\n So let me, let me push back.\n\n1:58:21.280 --> 1:58:24.600\n Sort of it's possible that that's capitalism solves that problem.\n\n1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:30.320\n Well, not, not if there's no money in really longterm planning and capitalism.\n\n1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:31.320\n Okay.\n\n1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:37.580\n There's money, there's money in the, isn't it possible to construct, isn't possible for\n\n1:58:37.580 --> 1:58:42.840\n capitalism to construct the system that ensures against catastrophic events?\n\n1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:47.500\n Not when they're systemic, you can ensure against episodic events.\n\n1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:52.440\n If you occasionally have a really bad storm, but in general the weather's not so bad that\n\n1:58:52.440 --> 1:58:56.400\n all the infrastructure is being destroyed, then you can share that around on a percentage\n\n1:58:56.400 --> 1:58:57.400\n basis.\n\n1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:02.040\n If you have a Gaussian distribution for your events and you don't, the mean doesn't move\n\n1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:06.520\n around too much and the standard deviation doesn't change all that much, then insurance\n\n1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:07.520\n works fine.\n\n1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:11.400\n But if you have an, if that's episodic, if you have systemic stuff where the climate\n\n1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:17.840\n is changing completely and you're going to wipe out your agricultural capabilities, you\n\n1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:20.180\n simply can't do insurance on that front.\n\n1:59:20.180 --> 1:59:24.080\n You can't make a profit out of catastrophe and capitalism.\n\n1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:25.080\n Okay.\n\n1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:29.920\n So that example of climate change, let's talk about it.\n\n1:59:29.920 --> 1:59:30.920\n Okay.\n\n1:59:30.920 --> 1:59:37.360\n So you mentioned that the human brain, the economy, and the biosphere are three of the\n\n1:59:37.360 --> 1:59:40.080\n most complex systems we know.\n\n1:59:40.080 --> 1:59:41.880\n Okay.\n\n1:59:41.880 --> 1:59:51.400\n And you also criticize the economics community for looking at the effects of climate change\n\n1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:55.240\n when measured as the effect on the GDP.\n\n1:59:55.240 --> 2:00:01.360\n So you're saying it's a catastrophic thing that the biggest challenge our society, our\n\n2:00:01.360 --> 2:00:02.840\n world is facing.\n\n2:00:02.840 --> 2:00:03.840\n Why?\n\n2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:10.000\n If the economists disagree with you, the effects on the GDP will be minor.\n\n2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:14.080\n So we'll deal with it when it comes.\n\n2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:16.120\n That's the argument against, that's the devil's advocate.\n\n2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:23.160\n You're saying, no, it is a thing that will change our world forever in ways that we should\n\n2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:25.520\n really, really, really be thinking about.\n\n2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:26.520\n Okay.\n\n2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520\n Okay.\n\n2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:28.520\n Make the case of why you disagree with the economists.\n\n2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:30.040\n The case is simple.\n\n2:00:30.040 --> 2:00:34.120\n Economists have made up their own numbers to say that it's trivial.\n\n2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:35.120\n And you didn't.\n\n2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:37.600\n No, I haven't even tried to make the numbers.\n\n2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:39.320\n I'm reading what the scientists write.\n\n2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:40.320\n Okay.\n\n2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:41.320\n Okay.\n\n2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:45.160\n And what the economists have done, and like this is William Nordhaus in particular, Nobel\n\n2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:50.200\n Prize winner, ex president of the American Economic Association, literally assumed that\n\n2:00:50.200 --> 2:00:52.280\n a roof will protect you from climate change.\n\n2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:54.880\n And he didn't say it in those words.\n\n2:00:54.880 --> 2:00:59.960\n What he said was 87% of American industry occurs in carefully controlled environments,\n\n2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:02.360\n which will not be subject to climate change.\n\n2:01:02.360 --> 2:01:08.200\n Now the only things that all of manufacturing, all of services, he included mining as well,\n\n2:01:08.200 --> 2:01:13.760\n meaning about open cut mining, government activities, and the finance sector, all they\n\n2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:16.120\n have in common is they happen beneath a roof.\n\n2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:20.800\n So he's basically saying climate affects the weather, climate is weather.\n\n2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.800\n Okay.\n\n2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:22.800\n Okay.\n\n2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:25.920\n Now that is not at all what is meant by climate change.\n\n2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.140\n It's changing the entire pattern of the weather system of the planet.\n\n2:01:32.140 --> 2:01:37.600\n For example, the most extreme form of climate change would be a breakdown in the three circulation\n\n2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:39.840\n cells that exist in each hemisphere.\n\n2:01:39.840 --> 2:01:44.480\n The Hadley cell, the Ferrer cell, I think it's called, and the polar cell, 0 to 30,\n\n2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:50.520\n 30 to 60, 60 to 90, those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere.\n\n2:01:50.520 --> 2:01:56.760\n Now if we get enough increase in the energy in the atmosphere, just like you turn the\n\n2:01:56.760 --> 2:02:01.220\n temperature up on a stove and you have nice bubbles occurring in a pot of soup and then\n\n2:02:01.220 --> 2:02:05.240\n turn the temperature up and they all break down and you've got bubbles everywhere, that's\n\n2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:06.600\n called the equitable climate.\n\n2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:12.320\n If that happens, then most of the rainfall is going to occur between 0 and 20 and 70\n\n2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:18.420\n and 90, and the middle is going to be dry, except for extreme storms.\n\n2:02:18.420 --> 2:02:24.620\n We built our societies in a period of extreme stability of the climate, and when you look\n\n2:02:24.620 --> 2:02:31.520\n at the long term temperature records, it's up and down like a seesaw, like a sawtooth\n\n2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:36.720\n blade between, say, one degree warmer than now and four degrees or six degrees cooler\n\n2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:39.000\n over the last million years.\n\n2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:43.700\n When you look at where we evolved, it's just at a turning point on the peak of one of those\n\n2:02:43.700 --> 2:02:44.700\n ups and downs.\n\n2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:48.760\n I've forgotten the name of the cycles, but the cycles are caused by changes in the Earth's\n\n2:02:48.760 --> 2:02:57.240\n rotation around the sun, and so we evolved our civilization just at the top, so coming\n\n2:02:57.240 --> 2:03:02.860\n up from a cold period, and then we're going to head down to another cold period, and that's\n\n2:03:02.860 --> 2:03:04.560\n when human civilization came along.\n\n2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:07.020\n It's about a period of about 12,000 years.\n\n2:03:07.020 --> 2:03:11.960\n So across that period, the temperature has changed by not much more than half a degree\n\n2:03:11.960 --> 2:03:12.960\n up and down.\n\n2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:20.600\n Now, we're blasting it well and truly out of those confines, and my way of interpreting\n\n2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.180\n what climate change means is the stability of that climate that enables to build sedentary\n\n2:03:25.180 --> 2:03:30.220\n civilizations and not be a nomadic species is being destroyed.\n\n2:03:30.220 --> 2:03:38.060\n So the challenge, and by the way, I'm playing devil's advocate right here.\n\n2:03:38.060 --> 2:03:42.280\n The question is, is there something fundamentally different now about human civilization that\n\n2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:51.480\n we're able to build technology that alleviates some of the destructive effects that we have\n\n2:03:51.480 --> 2:03:52.480\n on the climate?\n\n2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:53.480\n We don't know.\n\n2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:56.340\n We're going to find out the hard way.\n\n2:03:56.340 --> 2:03:58.920\n And the uncertainty, you think, would be very costly.\n\n2:03:58.920 --> 2:03:59.920\n Extremely.\n\n2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:05.800\n Like, many of the trajectories we might take would be much more costly than they're profitable.\n\n2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:06.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:10.440\n And like, when we're seeing some of the storms that are happening now in Europe, the ones\n\n2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:15.840\n that washed away a village in Germany some time ago, the firestorm that hit Canada of\n\n2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:19.980\n all places, I've forgotten the name of the town that was burnt down, but enormous temperatures\n\n2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.920\n in Canada, again, the storms that have been happening back in Australia.\n\n2:04:24.920 --> 2:04:29.400\n These are all manifestations of a complete shift in the weather patterns of the planet.\n\n2:04:29.400 --> 2:04:35.000\n And they can wipe out, like a village just disappears, just wiped out by unprecedented\n\n2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:39.280\n rains, and this keeps on happening.\n\n2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.200\n We are still living in a sedentary lifestyle when we're a nomadic species.\n\n2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:49.420\n So to be able to maintain that sedentary lifestyle, we do need to engineer the planet.\n\n2:04:49.420 --> 2:04:56.760\n We need to keep it within that range of plus half a degree Celsius, minus half a degree,\n\n2:04:56.760 --> 2:05:01.260\n which is really what it's been like for the last 10,000, 12,000 years, instead we're blasting\n\n2:05:01.260 --> 2:05:03.360\n it right out of that range.\n\n2:05:03.360 --> 2:05:07.360\n And we know some of the past climates that have existed then.\n\n2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:12.560\n We can model what they imply for our food production systems, for example.\n\n2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:15.320\n Not the only example, but obviously crucial.\n\n2:05:15.320 --> 2:05:20.880\n So when you look at what are called global climate models produced by scientists, one\n\n2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.480\n of the examples, and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021, in the chapter on what\n\n2:05:27.480 --> 2:05:32.360\n would happen if we lose what's called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,\n\n2:05:32.360 --> 2:05:35.920\n or AMOC, and people would colloquially know that as the Gulf Stream.\n\n2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:39.680\n And that's what distributes heat around all the oceans of the planet.\n\n2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:43.720\n It's part of a huge chain called the thermohaline circulation.\n\n2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:49.680\n But the part that goes across from the equator to the North Atlantic, that's called the AMOC\n\n2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:56.520\n and Gulf Stream colloquially, if that disappears in the context of a two and a half degree\n\n2:05:56.520 --> 2:06:02.960\n Celsius increase in average global temperature, then the proportion of the Earth's surface,\n\n2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:09.320\n which is suitable for producing wheat, will fall from 20% to 7%.\n\n2:06:09.320 --> 2:06:11.980\n Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall.\n\n2:06:11.980 --> 2:06:15.760\n The proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%.\n\n2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:19.200\n Now that means a catastrophic, and that's the word used in the report, catastrophic\n\n2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:22.080\n collapse in food production.\n\n2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:24.900\n So that's what we're toying with.\n\n2:06:24.900 --> 2:06:29.200\n And we are one and a half, we're actually less than, we're about halfway there to that\n\n2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:32.520\n two degrees, 2.5.\n\n2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:40.200\n And economists, on the other hand, and this is Richard Toll, published a paper 2016, claiming\n\n2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:45.920\n using what he calls an integrated assessment model that economists developed, that losing\n\n2:06:45.920 --> 2:06:51.080\n the Gulf Stream would increase global GDP by 1.1%.\n\n2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:55.040\n Now his model, this is what really pisses me off about these people, it's the worst\n\n2:06:55.040 --> 2:07:00.360\n work I've read in 50 years of being a critic of neoclassical economics.\n\n2:07:00.360 --> 2:07:06.560\n The GCMs, the one scientists produce, of course include precipitation as well as temperature.\n\n2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:12.420\n The IAMs that the economists produce, and this is stated yet again in a paper in 2021,\n\n2:07:12.420 --> 2:07:17.120\n do not include precipitation, they simply have temperature.\n\n2:07:17.120 --> 2:07:22.180\n So they assume that if temperature improves by moving towards a temperature which is better\n\n2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:26.120\n for producing aquaculture, okay, then so will precipitation.\n\n2:07:26.120 --> 2:07:30.780\n Now that's completely wrong, they've left out a crucial, imagine trying to model the\n\n2:07:30.780 --> 2:07:33.920\n climate while ignoring the fact that there's rainfall.\n\n2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:35.000\n That's what they've done.\n\n2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.200\n So their work is so bad, so dreadfully bad, it should never have been published.\n\n2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:40.680\n So they over, all right, all right, okay.\n\n2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:42.680\n I'm not gonna go for them, sorry, this is...\n\n2:07:42.680 --> 2:07:48.520\n Well, no, no, 100% as they deserve it, so it's an oversimplification, but I also want\n\n2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:55.160\n you to steel man people you disagree with and criticize people you agree with, if possible,\n\n2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:57.400\n to be sort of intellectually honest here.\n\n2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:07.960\n You do say, sort of to push back on the catastrophic thinking about climate change, that the ecology,\n\n2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:18.300\n the biosphere is a complex system, economics, the economy is a complex system.\n\n2:08:18.300 --> 2:08:22.080\n So how can we make predictions about complex systems?\n\n2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:28.920\n How can we make a hope of having a semi confident predictions about the complex system?\n\n2:08:28.920 --> 2:08:36.280\n So the scientific community is very confident about the complex system that is the biosphere\n\n2:08:36.280 --> 2:08:43.040\n and the crisis that's before us on the horizon.\n\n2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:47.840\n And then the economists are, as a community, I don't know, I don't know what percentage,\n\n2:08:47.840 --> 2:08:48.840\n but...\n\n2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:49.840\n Too much.\n\n2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:58.560\n Too much, that part of the community is very confident looking at the economics complex\n\n2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:07.840\n system in saying that, no, this system we have of labor and money and capital and so\n\n2:09:07.840 --> 2:09:12.040\n on, we'll be able to deal with that crisis and any other crisis.\n\n2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:19.340\n And they kind of construct simplified models that justify their confidence.\n\n2:09:19.340 --> 2:09:21.480\n So how do we know who to believe?\n\n2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:26.520\n For a start, if you believe the economists, you need your head read.\n\n2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:27.520\n Because when you...\n\n2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:28.520\n It's not an argument.\n\n2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:29.520\n No, it's not an argument.\n\n2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:30.520\n It's a summary of an argument.\n\n2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:31.520\n And that is the...\n\n2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:32.880\n No, that sounds a lot like an opinion and an emotional...\n\n2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:33.880\n I know.\n\n2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:34.880\n I know.\n\n2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:35.880\n I'm so angry about it.\n\n2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:39.040\n Listen, I'll tell you where I stand.\n\n2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:44.160\n And I've begun looking, studying the climate change much more.\n\n2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:52.080\n I used to be on things I don't understand, have not spent time on.\n\n2:09:52.080 --> 2:10:01.880\n I have so many colleagues that are scientists that I deeply respect, and I trust their opinion.\n\n2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:12.160\n I have seen the lesser angels of my colleagues on the pandemic side, on the COVID side.\n\n2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:20.060\n The confidence, the arrogance that in part blinded, I believe, the jump between basic\n\n2:10:20.060 --> 2:10:25.220\n scientific research to public policy.\n\n2:10:25.220 --> 2:10:32.240\n And then, so I've become a little bit more cautious in my trust on climate change.\n\n2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:37.880\n I'm still in the same place, and I don't mean climate change, on anything scientists say.\n\n2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:44.220\n I become a little bit, wait a minute.\n\n2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:49.960\n How does the basic scientific facts of our reality map to what we should do as a human\n\n2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:50.960\n civilization?\n\n2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:51.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:52.960\n There, I want to be a little bit careful.\n\n2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:57.240\n So whenever now I see arrogance and confidence, I become suspicious.\n\n2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:02.640\n Well, I'm the same, and that's why I'm being angry about The Economist, because there's\n\n2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:09.240\n incredible arrogance, incredible stupidity at the arrogance, assumptions which you look\n\n2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:12.120\n at it and think, how did anybody let that get published?\n\n2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:13.120\n Sure.\n\n2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:14.120\n Okay.\n\n2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:19.480\n So the economic analysis of the effects of climate change are poor, in many cases.\n\n2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:20.720\n Incredibly poor.\n\n2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:26.300\n And this is like, Bjorn Lomborg styles himself as the skeptical environmentalist and criticizes\n\n2:11:26.300 --> 2:11:28.660\n the environmental models.\n\n2:11:28.660 --> 2:11:30.120\n He doesn't take a look.\n\n2:11:30.120 --> 2:11:33.040\n He doesn't criticize the work come out by economists.\n\n2:11:33.040 --> 2:11:34.040\n You look at it.\n\n2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:35.280\n It's so bad.\n\n2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:39.960\n Is it possible to do good economics modeling of the effects of climate change?\n\n2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:42.200\n Yeah, it is possible.\n\n2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:43.200\n Very difficult.\n\n2:11:43.200 --> 2:11:45.800\n Or is it like one complex systems tech?\n\n2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:46.800\n It's two modes.\n\n2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:47.800\n In that case, yeah.\n\n2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:52.520\n I mean, like to me, what you should be looking at is saying, what are the scientists saying\n\n2:11:52.520 --> 2:11:58.160\n are the consequences, probable consequences, not guaranteed, but probable consequences\n\n2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:03.520\n of increasing the energy level of the atmosphere by the amount we're doing.\n\n2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:07.960\n What can the scientists say in terms of like, the effects, because it's so complicated,\n\n2:12:07.960 --> 2:12:15.280\n the effects of sort of shifting resources, so basically, what are the effects of climate\n\n2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:16.280\n change?\n\n2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:17.280\n How can we really model that?\n\n2:12:17.280 --> 2:12:22.240\n Because it's basically you're looking through the fog of uncertainty because they're rising\n\n2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:24.280\n sea levels.\n\n2:12:24.280 --> 2:12:26.080\n How can we know what effect that has?\n\n2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:28.520\n Well, we know there'll be a lot of change.\n\n2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:29.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:33.200\n Well, I don't actually, I think the sea level one is a poor argument, and I don't focus\n\n2:12:33.200 --> 2:12:34.200\n on it.\n\n2:12:34.200 --> 2:12:38.680\n What I mainly focus upon is the weather patterns, okay?\n\n2:12:38.680 --> 2:12:43.000\n And if you look at, like we've got the, the wheat belt in America goes through what Idaho\n\n2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:48.600\n and countries, places like that, and you've got an incredibly deep topsoil, like Ukraine\n\n2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:49.840\n is another classic example.\n\n2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:55.680\n The depth of the topsoil in Ukraine is remarkable, and that's the wheat bowl of Europe.\n\n2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:00.040\n And that requires both the right temperature for growing wheat and the right rainfall for\n\n2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:01.040\n growing wheat.\n\n2:13:01.040 --> 2:13:07.400\n Now, when you look at the models that climate scientists are building of that, you have\n\n2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:13.760\n pretty much, your ultimate foundation is the Lorenz model of turbulent flow.\n\n2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:19.240\n And of course, that's the first model which we saw chaos theory, complexity, that beautiful\n\n2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:25.400\n simple model, three variables, three parameters, an incredible complexity out of the system.\n\n2:13:25.400 --> 2:13:31.440\n But and what that meant was you also had an exponential decay in the accuracy of your\n\n2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:32.560\n model over time.\n\n2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:39.640\n So if you have, if you're accurate to a thousand decimal places, then in a thousand days, you'll\n\n2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:44.600\n have no data whatsoever, because each time you're losing an order of magnitude of accuracy.\n\n2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:48.840\n So that's the point about the inability to predict for the very long future.\n\n2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:51.760\n But what you can do is say, well, there's a prediction horizon.\n\n2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:57.080\n If we're close enough to the, if our statistical measurement of where we are is close enough\n\n2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:02.800\n to where we actually are, and our forecast horizon is narrow enough to not extrapolate\n\n2:14:02.800 --> 2:14:06.880\n too far, then for this direction forward, we can make a reasonable fist of predicting\n\n2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:08.720\n what the weather's going to be.\n\n2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:12.840\n And that's the foundation of meteorological, the stuff we watch on TV.\n\n2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:16.840\n You know, most of the time, the forecasts are going to be correct these days.\n\n2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:20.840\n 40, 50 years ago, most of the time, the forecasts were wrong.\n\n2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:24.600\n So that's the background foundation to these GCMs.\n\n2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:26.760\n But even they've got to massively simplify the world.\n\n2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:31.000\n So you have this enormous sphere of where they might divide it down to 100 kilometer\n\n2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:40.380\n by 100 kilometer by 10 kilometer cube, rectangles, whatever, oblongs.\n\n2:14:40.380 --> 2:14:45.800\n That's how they're modeling the transition of where they're from one location to another.\n\n2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.640\n So they've got a chunky vision of the planet, which they have to.\n\n2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:52.280\n They can't model it now down to the last molecule.\n\n2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:53.280\n So you're losing it.\n\n2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:54.280\n Not yet, right?\n\n2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:55.280\n It's getting better, better, better, better.\n\n2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:56.280\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:14:56.280 --> 2:14:58.440\n I think that's just too much processing power.\n\n2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:00.280\n But you're going to have some confines.\n\n2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:04.400\n You can't go, I mean, if you look at the models to do the weather, they used to be of that\n\n2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:08.120\n 100 kilometer, I think they're about 10 kilometer grids now, I don't know.\n\n2:15:08.120 --> 2:15:11.400\n So the processing powers let us get more and more precise that way.\n\n2:15:11.400 --> 2:15:16.960\n I do know that the models now include chemical mixing that occurs above cities.\n\n2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:19.120\n They've added that complexity to them over time.\n\n2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:23.080\n So you're looking at the increasingly accurate models of weather patterns, the effect they\n\n2:15:23.080 --> 2:15:25.760\n have on agriculture, on food.\n\n2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:31.920\n And you're saying that there's a lot of possibilities in which that's going to be really destructive\n\n2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:34.280\n to society on the food production side.\n\n2:15:34.280 --> 2:15:38.180\n And if you have that increase in temperature, you're going to get a change in precipitation.\n\n2:15:38.180 --> 2:15:42.540\n And it could mean that where the rainfall and the sunshine are adequate for growing\n\n2:15:42.540 --> 2:15:45.640\n wheat is an area where there's no topsoil.\n\n2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:50.680\n Like a huge part of the models, the models the economists use, which only use temperature,\n\n2:15:50.680 --> 2:15:51.680\n don't include precipitation.\n\n2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:58.340\n They predict that a large amount of the wheat output of the world is going to occur in Siberia\n\n2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:00.240\n in the frozen tundra.\n\n2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:05.300\n What about, so that's a straightforward criticism of oversimplified models.\n\n2:16:05.300 --> 2:16:09.680\n What about the idea that we innovate our way out of it?\n\n2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:17.600\n So there's totally new, what is the, there's a silly, poor example at this time perhaps,\n\n2:16:17.600 --> 2:16:22.280\n but lab grown meat, sort of engineered food.\n\n2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:30.680\n So a completely shifting source of food for civilization.\n\n2:16:30.680 --> 2:16:33.800\n So therefore alleviating some of the pressure on agriculture.\n\n2:16:33.800 --> 2:16:38.900\n That comes down to the difference that Elon makes between producing a prototype and mass\n\n2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:41.600\n producing the prototype.\n\n2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:47.800\n You can develop the idea very rapidly to put that into production on the scale that's necessary\n\n2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:49.440\n to replace what we're currently doing.\n\n2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:50.440\n Six years.\n\n2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:51.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:52.440\n And we haven't got years.\n\n2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:53.440\n We've got, we might have decades.\n\n2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:56.060\n We certainly haven't got centuries.\n\n2:16:56.060 --> 2:17:02.040\n So in the timeframe we've got, I can't see that engineering going from prototype to production\n\n2:17:02.040 --> 2:17:07.580\n levels to replace what we're currently doing in the stable environment they're currently\n\n2:17:07.580 --> 2:17:08.580\n destroying.\n\n2:17:08.580 --> 2:17:13.400\n What do you think about the sort of the catastrophic predictions that people that have thought\n\n2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:16.760\n have written about climate have made in the past that haven't come to people?\n\n2:17:16.760 --> 2:17:21.920\n That's mainly unfortunately involving Paul Ehrlich and the population bomb and the predictions\n\n2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:22.920\n Paul was making.\n\n2:17:22.920 --> 2:17:25.840\n A few individuals or the one individual in that case.\n\n2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:31.560\n So I'm mostly playing devil's advocate in this conversation and enjoying doing so.\n\n2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:38.360\n I do think I'm in agreement with the majority of the scientific community.\n\n2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.680\n But you still see that argument made.\n\n2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:42.760\n I still see the argument made.\n\n2:17:42.760 --> 2:17:47.560\n And I also am a little bit worried about the arrogance and the ineffectiveness of the arrogance.\n\n2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:48.560\n This is the problem.\n\n2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:50.020\n It's ineffective.\n\n2:17:50.020 --> 2:17:58.720\n And that's what worries me because it's all been put into the sort of sea level rise,\n\n2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:01.440\n temperature changes.\n\n2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:08.600\n It's not put into the fragility of the system in which we currently live.\n\n2:18:08.600 --> 2:18:09.600\n And the Earth will survive.\n\n2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:14.600\n And there's a wonderful science fiction book called The Earth Abides about a world in which\n\n2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:15.600\n humans get wiped out.\n\n2:18:15.600 --> 2:18:19.200\n There's only a tiny little band left and then the Earth reasserts itself.\n\n2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:20.880\n So the Earth's going to survive us.\n\n2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:22.500\n Will we survive what we do to the Earth?\n\n2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.160\n That's the question.\n\n2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:32.600\n And my feeling is that we have underplayed the extent to which the civilizations were\n\n2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:36.360\n built have depended upon a relatively stable climate.\n\n2:18:36.360 --> 2:18:41.240\n And it's then there's that turning point in the global average temperature that we evolved\n\n2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:42.500\n right on the top of it.\n\n2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:46.840\n And if we had done nothing, we could find that heading back down towards another ice\n\n2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:51.000\n age could equally destroy the possibility of sedentary life.\n\n2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:58.000\n So for example, if we'd never developed fossil fuel based industries, we'd never built superphosphate,\n\n2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:02.760\n so our population would never have reached one billion people, and we were still living\n\n2:19:02.760 --> 2:19:09.160\n like fairly sophisticated animals, but like 17th century level of load on the planet,\n\n2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:12.080\n then we would have gone down that decline.\n\n2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:17.440\n And the approaching ice age would have started to wipe out our farming areas, the glaciers\n\n2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:21.940\n would have encroached, and we would have been driven out of like an agricultural sedentary\n\n2:19:21.940 --> 2:19:24.000\n civilization by that change.\n\n2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:30.200\n So it's just the fact that we evolved on this stable period in the overall temperature cycle\n\n2:19:30.200 --> 2:19:31.260\n of the planet.\n\n2:19:31.260 --> 2:19:36.360\n And that stability is something which just reflects the turning point in the regular\n\n2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:38.800\n cycle of Malicevich cycle, I think it's called.\n\n2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:43.980\n I've forgotten the actual name, but it's a cycle caused by change in the Earth's orbit\n\n2:19:43.980 --> 2:19:48.040\n around the sun, reflectivity and so on.\n\n2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:53.320\n That cycle, it's just that tiny top bit that we evolved in.\n\n2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:56.840\n So what we should have done is, well, that's really useful for us, we should stay at that\n\n2:19:56.840 --> 2:19:57.840\n level.\n\n2:19:57.840 --> 2:20:01.420\n Now, if we hadn't done it, we'd go back down here and that'd be the end of our civilization\n\n2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:02.420\n by an ice age.\n\n2:20:02.420 --> 2:20:08.620\n Instead, we're going up here really rapidly, and we're causing a change in temperature\n\n2:20:08.620 --> 2:20:14.720\n compared to that long term cycle 100,000 times faster.\n\n2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:24.360\n So yeah, I mean, my biggest worry is even subtle changes in climate might result in\n\n2:20:24.360 --> 2:20:28.920\n geopolitical pressures that then lead to nuclear war.\n\n2:20:28.920 --> 2:20:33.600\n And that's, yeah, I mean, there's an argument that's actually behind, to some extent, not\n\n2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:39.340\n the Ukraine war so much, but the Arab Spring, the wars in Syria, which partially has led\n\n2:20:39.340 --> 2:20:42.000\n to what's happening in Ukraine.\n\n2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:45.560\n And our weapons are getting more and more powerful and more and more destructive.\n\n2:20:45.560 --> 2:20:49.080\n More and more nations are having these destructive weapons.\n\n2:20:49.080 --> 2:20:54.520\n And now we're entering cyberspace, where it's even easier to be destructive.\n\n2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:58.080\n And hyperbaric weapons, which didn't exist in the Second World War.\n\n2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:03.040\n So you don't need nuclear weapons to have catastrophic attacks on each other.\n\n2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:12.680\n So yeah, it's incredibly scary that the warlike side of human nature could be extremely enhanced\n\n2:21:12.680 --> 2:21:14.600\n by climate breakdown.\n\n2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:21.820\n So in this world, on a happy note, I don't know how we went from Marxism and Stalinism\n\n2:21:21.820 --> 2:21:28.040\n to ecology, but all those are beautiful, complex systems.\n\n2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:31.620\n What is the best form of government, would you say?\n\n2:21:31.620 --> 2:21:36.520\n We talked about the economics of things.\n\n2:21:36.520 --> 2:21:40.440\n You ran for office, so you care about politics too.\n\n2:21:40.440 --> 2:21:43.640\n How can politics, what political systems can help us here?\n\n2:21:43.640 --> 2:21:50.200\n I think we first of all have to appreciate we're one species on a planet out of millions.\n\n2:21:50.200 --> 2:21:57.040\n And as the intelligent species, we should be enabling a harmonious life for those other\n\n2:21:57.040 --> 2:21:58.040\n species as well.\n\n2:21:58.040 --> 2:21:59.860\n Can we actually linger on that?\n\n2:21:59.860 --> 2:22:08.400\n What is, you mentioned that we need to acknowledge the value of life on Earth.\n\n2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:18.360\n Can we integrate the labor theory of value, can we integrate into that the value of life?\n\n2:22:18.360 --> 2:22:21.840\n So there's human life, and there's life.\n\n2:22:21.840 --> 2:22:28.240\n If you take that structure that I talked about of Marx's use value, exchange value, dialectic,\n\n2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:32.480\n and foreground background, that only exists, that only works because we're exploiting the\n\n2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:35.040\n free energy we find in the universe.\n\n2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:41.840\n There could be no production system without free energy, which is the first law of thermodynamics\n\n2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:42.840\n that exists.\n\n2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:47.000\n There is free lunch, after all, and it's grounded in the energy that's provided to us by the\n\n2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:48.000\n universe.\n\n2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:49.000\n Well, yeah, that's the free lunch.\n\n2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:50.000\n That's what we're exploiting.\n\n2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:51.000\n It's the only free lunch we get.\n\n2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.320\n You know Ginsburg's summary of the laws of thermodynamics, don't you?\n\n2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:55.320\n Allen Ginsberg?\n\n2:22:55.320 --> 2:22:56.320\n What's that?\n\n2:22:56.320 --> 2:23:04.600\n The laws of thermodynamics are summarized as A, you can't win, B, you can't break even,\n\n2:23:04.600 --> 2:23:08.600\n C, you can't leave the game.\n\n2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:09.600\n Beautiful summary.\n\n2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:10.600\n Beautiful summary.\n\n2:23:10.600 --> 2:23:14.120\n But the fact that it exists in the first place is the free lunch.\n\n2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:15.920\n So we're exploiting the free lunch.\n\n2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:20.320\n But to be able to do it, we can't put waste back into that system so much that it undermines\n\n2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.320\n the free lunch.\n\n2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:23.840\n And that's what we've been doing.\n\n2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:30.120\n And once you respect the fact that we have to, living on the biosphere, the planet we're\n\n2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:35.960\n actually on, we have to enable that biosphere to survive us.\n\n2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:40.200\n Because if it doesn't survive us, we won't survive it disappearing.\n\n2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:43.520\n And there's not that realization in humanity in general.\n\n2:23:43.520 --> 2:23:49.320\n And when you say the value of life, you know, all the different living organisms on Earth\n\n2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:51.640\n are part of that biosphere.\n\n2:23:51.640 --> 2:23:58.720\n So in order to maintain the biosphere, we have to respect, like pragmatically speaking,\n\n2:23:58.720 --> 2:24:01.720\n what that means is actually respecting all of life on Earth.\n\n2:24:01.720 --> 2:24:02.720\n Even the mosquitoes?\n\n2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:03.720\n I've got some, no.\n\n2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:04.720\n Parasites.\n\n2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:10.540\n I mean, we are a parasite.\n\n2:24:10.540 --> 2:24:17.160\n When you look at it, we're the mosquitoes of the large organizations.\n\n2:24:17.160 --> 2:24:18.800\n You're a fan of the Matrix movies at all?\n\n2:24:18.800 --> 2:24:19.800\n Sure.\n\n2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:20.800\n Okay.\n\n2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:21.800\n That's what I'm wearing.\n\n2:24:21.800 --> 2:24:22.800\n Absolutely.\n\n2:24:22.800 --> 2:24:23.800\n I was wondering what the inspiration was.\n\n2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:24.800\n I was thinking...\n\n2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:25.800\n It's not really inspiration.\n\n2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:30.760\n We are living in a simulation, and I have a conversation offline to have with you about\n\n2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:31.760\n that.\n\n2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:34.320\n You've been misbehaving, and we're going to have to put you back in line.\n\n2:24:34.320 --> 2:24:39.960\n So what's Agent Smith says when he's got Morpheus in his possession, he said, I've been trying\n\n2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:45.000\n to classify your species, and I've decided you're a virus.\n\n2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:46.240\n Now there's truth to that.\n\n2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:48.880\n We have intruded into everything.\n\n2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:55.000\n We've taken over every element of the biosphere, and we think we can continue doing that.\n\n2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:57.320\n And the thing is, we're breaking that.\n\n2:24:57.320 --> 2:24:59.880\n We're exporting it so much, we're breaking it down.\n\n2:24:59.880 --> 2:25:03.400\n And I think it's E.O. Wilson who argued the 50 percent rule.\n\n2:25:03.400 --> 2:25:09.560\n He believed that we should reserve 50 percent of the planet for nonhuman species.\n\n2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:13.380\n In other words, we make 50 percent of it off limits.\n\n2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:15.220\n Humans cannot go there.\n\n2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:17.560\n And we just let that evolve as it does.\n\n2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:19.760\n And then we control the other 50 percent.\n\n2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:22.480\n I think it's probably giving too much to us.\n\n2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:27.940\n I think we should actually save like 20 percent, 25 percent max on the rest of the planet.\n\n2:25:27.940 --> 2:25:34.500\n We let life go on and evolve as it does without our interference, without our dominance.\n\n2:25:34.500 --> 2:25:40.240\n Now that's neither a democratic system nor an authoritarian one.\n\n2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:44.280\n It's one which starts off with saying the first thing humans have to do is respect life\n\n2:25:44.280 --> 2:25:45.280\n itself.\n\n2:25:45.280 --> 2:25:46.280\n Okay?\n\n2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:50.060\n So would we do that?\n\n2:25:50.060 --> 2:25:52.120\n We haven't done it, obviously.\n\n2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:56.060\n I don't think the Soviets would have done it if we had a generally Soviet system.\n\n2:25:56.060 --> 2:25:58.360\n We haven't done it under a capitalist.\n\n2:25:58.360 --> 2:25:59.880\n We continue intruding.\n\n2:25:59.880 --> 2:26:05.360\n So I think we have to go through something like a Star Trek, a Star Trek, you know, catastrophic\n\n2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:10.120\n 200 years to realize that ultimately if we're going to survive as a species, we have to\n\n2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:12.080\n respect life in general.\n\n2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:18.760\n And then that means parts of the planet we can no longer touch, while we also try to\n\n2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:25.560\n maintain the planet at the temperature that we found it in what we now call the Anthropocene.\n\n2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:34.000\n So politically, we have to have, like in many ways what native societies often have, a vision\n\n2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.320\n of the cycle of life, not this exponential progression we've developed over the last\n\n2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:42.080\n 250 years.\n\n2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.260\n And again, I'll use another movie, the Avatar type respect for the cycle of life.\n\n2:26:46.260 --> 2:26:49.600\n We need to have that as part of our innate nature.\n\n2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:53.840\n And then on top of that, the political system comes out.\n\n2:26:53.840 --> 2:27:01.240\n Now that political system has to be one that lets us feel like we have a say in the direction\n\n2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:04.400\n of society while that part is sacrosanct.\n\n2:27:04.400 --> 2:27:06.080\n We can't touch it.\n\n2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:10.800\n But we also, because we are now living with so many challenges created by our own civilization,\n\n2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:17.000\n I mean, the main threat to the existence of human civilization is the existence of human\n\n2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:18.000\n civilization.\n\n2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:19.680\n Is both a feature and a bug.\n\n2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:20.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:24.880\n And therefore, we need to have people who can understand complex systems making those\n\n2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:25.880\n decisions.\n\n2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:30.560\n Now that means it isn't a political system as much as it is an appreciation that the\n\n2:27:30.560 --> 2:27:32.200\n world is a complex system.\n\n2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:36.640\n And therefore, effects, which we think are direct effects, will actually come through\n\n2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:38.440\n an oblique fashion.\n\n2:27:38.440 --> 2:27:45.060\n And we cannot, there's no simple linear progression from where we are to where we want to be.\n\n2:27:45.060 --> 2:27:47.880\n So you have to see how everything feeds together in a systemic way.\n\n2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:51.600\n And that's why, one reason I designed this off where I'm wearing the tshirt for now,\n\n2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:57.600\n Minsky, is to have, it's nowhere near to this scale, I hope it one way will be, but something\n\n2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:01.040\n which means we can bring together all that complexity, all those systems, and perceive\n\n2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:05.800\n them on an enormous screen where we have all the various interacts and we can see what\n\n2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:08.900\n a potential future is.\n\n2:28:08.900 --> 2:28:10.540\n And that then guides us.\n\n2:28:10.540 --> 2:28:16.280\n So it isn't a case of democracy and, you know, our side wins a vote and therefore we ban\n\n2:28:16.280 --> 2:28:19.600\n abortion or we don't, you know, whatever else happens.\n\n2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:25.120\n It's seeing what the, respecting the fact that we're in a complex system, and being\n\n2:28:25.120 --> 2:28:34.440\n uncertain about the consequences, and not making the bold, expansionary ideas that we've\n\n2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:35.440\n been doing.\n\n2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:41.920\n So like, being a little bit more, uh, humble.\n\n2:28:41.920 --> 2:28:43.600\n Humble.\n\n2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:44.720\n Humble is a good word.\n\n2:28:44.720 --> 2:28:55.400\n But wouldn't you like to apply that same humility both to the considerations of the pros of\n\n2:28:55.400 --> 2:29:00.840\n capitalism and to the catastrophic view of the effects of climate change?\n\n2:29:00.840 --> 2:29:01.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:05.400\n And also, like, I think we can afford to be bold in space.\n\n2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:10.480\n And that's one reason I respect the practical vision of Musk and so far impractical vision\n\n2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:16.760\n of Bezos, that if we're going, we look for the very far future, the only way we can continue\n\n2:29:16.760 --> 2:29:23.400\n expanding our knowledge of the universe is to move our civilization, the productive side\n\n2:29:23.400 --> 2:29:24.600\n of off the planet.\n\n2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:25.600\n Offsite backup.\n\n2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:26.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:28.000\n So can you actually linger on this?\n\n2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:29.880\n So let's actually talk about this.\n\n2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:36.680\n So first of all, you have the new book, uh, humbly named, uh, named The New Economics\n\n2:29:36.680 --> 2:29:38.720\n A Manifesto.\n\n2:29:38.720 --> 2:29:39.720\n Publisher chose the title.\n\n2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:40.720\n Yes.\n\n2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:47.240\n No, but I'm joking, but, um, maybe I will ask you about why Manifesto, but we'll go\n\n2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:48.840\n through some of the ideas in this book.\n\n2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:56.880\n We have been already, uh, so some of it is embracing the fact that the economy, our world,\n\n2:29:56.880 --> 2:29:58.520\n our mind is a complex system.\n\n2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:06.520\n So this t shirt that you're wearing, yep, take it out, yeah, is, uh, the software I'll\n\n2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:07.520\n do that.\n\n2:30:07.520 --> 2:30:13.280\n There you go, there you go, you're wearing a, what is this, an infomercial?\n\n2:30:13.280 --> 2:30:21.880\n So there's a t shirt that says Minsky, um, after not, not, not my Minsky, it's your\n\n2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:22.880\n Minsky.\n\n2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:23.880\n Not Hyman.\n\n2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:25.520\n So no, the Hyman Minsky, not Marvin Minsky.\n\n2:30:25.520 --> 2:30:26.720\n Not Marvin Minsky, right.\n\n2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:33.900\n So that's, so AI Minsky is, is Marvin and then, uh, Harman, uh, it all rhymes.\n\n2:30:33.900 --> 2:30:45.720\n So stability is free open source system dynamic software invented by Mr. Steve Keen, uh, coded\n\n2:30:45.720 --> 2:30:51.120\n by Russell Standish, it's on SourceForge.\n\n2:30:51.120 --> 2:30:52.120\n It's destabilizing.\n\n2:30:52.120 --> 2:30:53.860\n Stability is destabilizing.\n\n2:30:53.860 --> 2:30:58.280\n So that's sort of embracing the, the complex aspect of it.\n\n2:30:58.280 --> 2:30:59.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:30:59.280 --> 2:31:01.600\n So how can you model the economy?\n\n2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:07.620\n What are some of the interesting, whether detailed or high level, big picture ideas\n\n2:31:07.620 --> 2:31:10.480\n behind your efforts of Minsky?\n\n2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:11.480\n Okay.\n\n2:31:11.480 --> 2:31:16.600\n Minsky, um, meaning the software, the modeling software that, that models the dynamic system.\n\n2:31:16.600 --> 2:31:19.980\n Basically what Minsky is doing is system dynamics modeling.\n\n2:31:19.980 --> 2:31:26.200\n So it's, if anybody's used Stellar or Vensim or Simulink, um, then they've used exactly\n\n2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:28.500\n the same family of software that Minsky is part of.\n\n2:31:28.500 --> 2:31:29.500\n So I didn't invent that.\n\n2:31:29.500 --> 2:31:33.480\n It was invented by Jay Forrester, who's one of the great intellects, one of the great\n\n2:31:33.480 --> 2:31:36.600\n engineers, uh, in American history.\n\n2:31:36.600 --> 2:31:41.640\n And the idea of, of, of Forrester's system was, uh, complex interactions.\n\n2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:48.160\n So he was doing his work in the fifties, um, uh, if people don't know Forrester's work,\n\n2:31:48.160 --> 2:31:53.200\n he actually built the models of the, um, uh, the, the mathematics for the gun turrets on\n\n2:31:53.200 --> 2:31:57.580\n American warships in the second world war mechanical systems, obviously.\n\n2:31:57.580 --> 2:32:01.720\n So he had to work out, you know, how to give a feedback system that meant when the boat\n\n2:32:01.720 --> 2:32:05.400\n rolled in one direction, the, the tower did not roll the other way.\n\n2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:06.960\n All that stuff was his work.\n\n2:32:06.960 --> 2:32:08.480\n So marvelous engineering.\n\n2:32:08.480 --> 2:32:13.320\n And then he realized if you want to look at a, even like a factory, a factory is a complex\n\n2:32:13.320 --> 2:32:14.320\n system.\n\n2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:18.000\n And so you get cycles generated out of the interaction between different components of\n\n2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:22.160\n the factory that he was first involved in taming, that he built the software to model\n\n2:32:22.160 --> 2:32:23.960\n complex interactive systems.\n\n2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:27.920\n So Minsky is that, the thing that Minsky adds, which is unique is the Godley table.\n\n2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:29.500\n And that's the double entry bookkeeping.\n\n2:32:29.500 --> 2:32:34.000\n So you can model the financial system, Godley, the economist, Godley, the economy, Wynn Godley,\n\n2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:35.740\n another great, great man.\n\n2:32:35.740 --> 2:32:40.440\n So there, there's like this, so you're modeling it as like a state diagram.\n\n2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:41.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:42.440\n Fundamentally.\n\n2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:43.620\n It's actually, it is circuit diagrams.\n\n2:32:43.620 --> 2:32:48.840\n It's exactly what engineers have been using for decades, almost a century.\n\n2:32:48.840 --> 2:32:52.280\n So you're using a circuit diagram to model the economy.\n\n2:32:52.280 --> 2:32:55.960\n And that's, that's the, so other factories have done it.\n\n2:32:55.960 --> 2:33:01.200\n What they, what they haven't had in the circuit diagram is a way of handling the dynamics\n\n2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:02.860\n of the financial system.\n\n2:33:02.860 --> 2:33:09.040\n So what the Godley table does is bring it financial flows as being everything goes from\n\n2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:11.400\n somewhere and ends up somewhere.\n\n2:33:11.400 --> 2:33:16.840\n So you have a positive and a negative, if you're looking on the liability side, a positive\n\n2:33:16.840 --> 2:33:20.960\n and a positive or negative and a negative, you're looking at assets and liabilities side\n\n2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:22.920\n and Minsky gets the accounting right for that.\n\n2:33:22.920 --> 2:33:27.640\n So you can do an enormous complex model looking at the economy financially from the point\n\n2:33:27.640 --> 2:33:32.680\n of view of a dozen different actors in the economy and know that the mathematics is right.\n\n2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:36.400\n Even though what you're building is set of differential equations, which might be 50\n\n2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:40.020\n differential equations with 350 terms in them.\n\n2:33:40.020 --> 2:33:43.540\n If you've got the Godley tables right, you know the mathematics is correct.\n\n2:33:43.540 --> 2:33:45.680\n So that's the main innovation that Minsky adds.\n\n2:33:45.680 --> 2:33:48.680\n And you're operating there at the macroeconomics level.\n\n2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:49.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:50.680\n It's definitely macro.\n\n2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:52.760\n It's not agent based.\n\n2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:57.320\n And then this, I'm just open on random page that I think is very relevant here.\n\n2:33:57.320 --> 2:34:01.160\n The process, this is referring to Minsky, not the software, maybe the software.\n\n2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:02.160\n I don't know.\n\n2:34:02.160 --> 2:34:05.920\n The process can be captured in an extremely simple causal chain.\n\n2:34:05.920 --> 2:34:08.180\n Capital determines output, output determines employment.\n\n2:34:08.180 --> 2:34:11.440\n The rate of employment determines the rate of change of wages.\n\n2:34:11.440 --> 2:34:14.400\n Output minus wages and interest payments determines profit.\n\n2:34:14.400 --> 2:34:17.960\n The profit rate determines the, there's a very nice circuit here.\n\n2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:23.560\n The profit rate determines the level of investment, which is the change in capital, which takes\n\n2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:26.240\n us back to the beginning of this causal chain.\n\n2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:32.600\n And the difference between investment and profits determines the change in private debt.\n\n2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:38.920\n And there's some nice, the Keen Minsky model and the intermittent route to chaos on page\n\n2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:40.520\n 86 of your book.\n\n2:34:40.520 --> 2:34:42.480\n These are, do these come from the software?\n\n2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:43.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:43.480 --> 2:34:44.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:50.280\n I was a mathematician back in 1992, August, 1992.\n\n2:34:50.280 --> 2:34:52.000\n Mathematics is another amazing piece of software.\n\n2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:53.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:55.160\n And I find it, it's very much a programmer's approach to mathematics.\n\n2:34:55.160 --> 2:35:00.680\n I prefer like a program called Mathcad, which is what I'm using for all my, when I do my\n\n2:35:00.680 --> 2:35:04.040\n mathematics on the computer, I write in Mathcad.\n\n2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:05.600\n CAD or CAB?\n\n2:35:05.600 --> 2:35:06.600\n CAD.\n\n2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:07.600\n Okay.\n\n2:35:07.600 --> 2:35:09.400\n It's been ruined by bad management.\n\n2:35:09.400 --> 2:35:13.560\n They chucked out all the good engineers and I'm still using a version which is 12 years\n\n2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:14.560\n old.\n\n2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:16.520\n If only engineers ruled the world.\n\n2:35:16.520 --> 2:35:20.640\n If only engineers, rather than this particular case, there was a bunch of marketers for CAD\n\n2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:22.220\n software agreed.\n\n2:35:22.220 --> 2:35:24.020\n I'm definitely a fan of engineers.\n\n2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:26.160\n What are the plots that we're looking at here?\n\n2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:31.400\n Growth rate, private debt ratio, employment versus wages, employment versus debt, income\n\n2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:32.400\n distribution.\n\n2:35:32.400 --> 2:35:36.160\n So this is across years, like different trade offs.\n\n2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:39.480\n Is there something interesting to say about the plots and the insights from those plots\n\n2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:41.920\n that are generated by the software?\n\n2:35:41.920 --> 2:35:46.200\n That's a particular parameter value is to give that outcome.\n\n2:35:46.200 --> 2:35:50.380\n But what happened when I first simulated the model, I took a model by a guy called Richard\n\n2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:56.920\n Goodwin who's one of the great neglected economists, American Marxist, mathematical Marxist.\n\n2:35:56.920 --> 2:35:59.420\n And what he did was build a model of cycles.\n\n2:35:59.420 --> 2:36:06.200\n And he actually wrote a paper called, it's only about a five page paper published in\n\n2:36:06.200 --> 2:36:09.700\n a book and a very, very obscure conference paper.\n\n2:36:09.700 --> 2:36:13.660\n And what he was doing was trying to build a model of Marx.\n\n2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:19.840\n So he wrote it in 1967 and it was putting into mathematical form a model that Marx came\n\n2:36:19.840 --> 2:36:21.700\n up with in 1867.\n\n2:36:21.700 --> 2:36:24.360\n So it was a centenary birthday present to Marx.\n\n2:36:24.360 --> 2:36:35.780\n And what Marx had argued in chapter 25, I think, of volume one of Capital, section three,\n\n2:36:35.780 --> 2:36:39.140\n he built a verbal model of a cyclical system.\n\n2:36:39.140 --> 2:36:41.600\n And it's quite out of character with the rest of the book.\n\n2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:47.600\n So when you read volume one of Capital, people think Marx has got a commodity view of money.\n\n2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:50.420\n He doesn't at all.\n\n2:36:50.420 --> 2:36:53.840\n The idea was he had like an onion, you start off on the middle level and you ignore the\n\n2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:56.480\n outer layer, then you bring the outer layer and so on and so forth.\n\n2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:01.520\n Anyway, in this model, in volume one of Capital, he normally just assumed work has got a subsistence\n\n2:37:01.520 --> 2:37:02.520\n wage.\n\n2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:03.520\n That's it.\n\n2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:09.800\n In this little chapter, he said that if the economy is, effectively he said, the economy\n\n2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:14.200\n is booming, then workers will demand wage rises.\n\n2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:18.580\n And the wage rises will cut into the profit so that capitalists will not get the level\n\n2:37:18.580 --> 2:37:20.520\n of profit they're expecting.\n\n2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:23.800\n Therefore they will invest less and the economy will slump.\n\n2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:28.920\n And the slump will mean workers become unemployed and have to accept wage cuts.\n\n2:37:28.920 --> 2:37:31.140\n And it was a model of a cyclical economy.\n\n2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:35.720\n And as it happens, Marx spent his later years trying to learn enough calculus to be able\n\n2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:37.780\n to model it himself mathematically.\n\n2:37:37.780 --> 2:37:38.780\n And he never managed.\n\n2:37:38.780 --> 2:37:42.880\n There's Marx's mathematical notes on calculus, which are quite fun to read if you have a\n\n2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:43.880\n mathematical background.\n\n2:37:43.880 --> 2:37:44.880\n Did he get far?\n\n2:37:44.880 --> 2:37:45.880\n Far?\n\n2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:46.880\n Far?\n\n2:37:46.880 --> 2:37:47.880\n No.\n\n2:37:47.880 --> 2:37:50.560\n He got too caught up in the whole philosophy and never really got to build the model.\n\n2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:54.240\n But what Goodman realized was a predator prey model.\n\n2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:55.240\n Okay.\n\n2:37:55.240 --> 2:37:57.920\n The Locta Volterra model was the basis of the idea.\n\n2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:07.400\n So the idea is you have a prey, and the example that Locta actually used initially was grass.\n\n2:38:07.400 --> 2:38:08.680\n Grass is the prey.\n\n2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:12.200\n And then you have a predator, and the predator were cows.\n\n2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:15.560\n So you start off with a very few cows, lots of grass.\n\n2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:19.300\n And then because of lots of grass, the numbers of cows grow.\n\n2:38:19.300 --> 2:38:21.720\n And then because the cows grow, they start to eat the grass.\n\n2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:25.420\n So the grass runs out, so the cows starve, and you get a cycle.\n\n2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:28.860\n And what Locta was amazed by was that the cycles were persistent.\n\n2:38:28.860 --> 2:38:30.060\n They didn't die out.\n\n2:38:30.060 --> 2:38:33.940\n So Goodman got that vision, and he then built a predator prey model.\n\n2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:37.960\n And I, first of all, read Goodman and really found it really hard to follow his writing.\n\n2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:42.880\n He's not a very good writer, but a guy called John Blatt, who was a professor of mathematics\n\n2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:48.500\n at New South Wales University, wrote a brilliant explanation of Goodman's model in a book called\n\n2:38:48.500 --> 2:38:49.720\n Dynamic Economic Systems.\n\n2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:50.720\n And I read that.\n\n2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:55.900\n It was superb, and he said a way he could extend this was to include finance.\n\n2:38:55.900 --> 2:39:00.460\n So I thought, okay, what I'm going to have is that what Goodman presumed is capitalists\n\n2:39:00.460 --> 2:39:02.740\n invest all their profits.\n\n2:39:02.740 --> 2:39:08.620\n So you get a boom when there's a high rate of profit because they invest all that money,\n\n2:39:08.620 --> 2:39:13.300\n and then a slump when there's low profit because depreciation will wipe away capital and you'll\n\n2:39:13.300 --> 2:39:14.840\n go boom and slump.\n\n2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:21.100\n So I simply added in, well, capitalists will invest more than their profits during a boom,\n\n2:39:21.100 --> 2:39:23.760\n but less than their profits during a slump.\n\n2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:27.220\n And that therefore means they had to borrow money to finance the gap and pay interest\n\n2:39:27.220 --> 2:39:28.340\n on the debt.\n\n2:39:28.340 --> 2:39:32.660\n So I ended up with a model with just three systems states, the income share, the wages\n\n2:39:32.660 --> 2:39:38.260\n distribution of income between workers, capitalists, and bankers, the level of employment, and\n\n2:39:38.260 --> 2:39:40.540\n the level of private debt.\n\n2:39:40.540 --> 2:39:45.620\n And those three equations are fundamentally like going from the Locke to Volterra model\n\n2:39:45.620 --> 2:39:50.380\n with just two equations, and therefore you get a fixed cycle, to the Lorenz model where\n\n2:39:50.380 --> 2:39:51.920\n you have three.\n\n2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:54.300\n And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome.\n\n2:39:54.300 --> 2:40:00.560\n So what you're seeing is a manifestation of chaos, complexity in those plots.\n\n2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:08.740\n But one of the many fascinating parts about it was that as the level of private debt rose,\n\n2:40:08.740 --> 2:40:12.860\n in my model I had capitalists being the only ones who borrowed, but the people who paid\n\n2:40:12.860 --> 2:40:17.460\n for the high level of private debt were the workers.\n\n2:40:17.460 --> 2:40:22.780\n The rising banker's share corresponded exactly to a falling worker's share.\n\n2:40:22.780 --> 2:40:26.580\n So you can infer from that that the workers are the ones paying.\n\n2:40:26.580 --> 2:40:28.020\n Effectively, the workers end up paying for it.\n\n2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:30.220\n They get a lower level of wages.\n\n2:40:30.220 --> 2:40:36.120\n And the basic dynamic is that capitalists, when you have a three social class system,\n\n2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:38.820\n your income goes between workers, capitalists, and bankers.\n\n2:40:38.820 --> 2:40:41.860\n Now in the system, the good one did, they're just workers and capitalists.\n\n2:40:41.860 --> 2:40:45.380\n So if workers share rose, capitalists share had to fall.\n\n2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:49.180\n But when you have three social classes, then capitalists share can remain constant while\n\n2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:53.580\n workers fall and bankers rise.\n\n2:40:53.580 --> 2:40:55.580\n So that's what actually happened.\n\n2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:59.580\n Because capitalists, the simple way I modeled it was there's a certain rate of profit at\n\n2:40:59.580 --> 2:41:02.180\n which capitalists invest all their profits.\n\n2:41:02.180 --> 2:41:05.620\n Above that they borrow more, below that they pay off debt.\n\n2:41:05.620 --> 2:41:09.820\n So what would happen is when you got back to that point, then the level of investment\n\n2:41:09.820 --> 2:41:13.260\n would be a precise share of GDP.\n\n2:41:13.260 --> 2:41:15.980\n And therefore you'd get a precise rate of economic growth.\n\n2:41:15.980 --> 2:41:20.740\n But if there was a higher percentage going to bankers and offset by a lower share going\n\n2:41:20.740 --> 2:41:23.140\n to workers, it didn't affect the capitalists.\n\n2:41:23.140 --> 2:41:31.720\n So what you get is the cycles sort of diminish for a while because there's the income distribution\n\n2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:32.720\n effect is important.\n\n2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:37.140\n So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt.\n\n2:41:37.140 --> 2:41:40.580\n But the other side of it was that the cycles would diminish for a while.\n\n2:41:40.580 --> 2:41:45.660\n Now what you get is a period of diminishing cycles, then leading to rising cycles.\n\n2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:53.840\n And technically this is known as the Pomeranville route to chaos, and it's one particular element\n\n2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:57.580\n of Lorenzo's equations of fluid dynamics.\n\n2:41:57.580 --> 2:42:03.380\n So what they found was in examining laminar flow in a fluid, you have a period where the\n\n2:42:03.380 --> 2:42:09.760\n laminar flow got more laminar, and then suddenly it'd start to get less laminar and go turbulent.\n\n2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:14.500\n And this is what actually goes on in the model, so in my model of Minsky.\n\n2:42:14.500 --> 2:42:19.800\n So what you have is a period where there's big berms and cycles, and then as the debt\n\n2:42:19.800 --> 2:42:23.640\n level rises, the berms and slumps get smaller.\n\n2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:28.000\n And that looks like what neoclassical economists call the Great Moderation.\n\n2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:33.780\n So when I first modeled this in 1982, I finished up my paper, which was published in 95, with\n\n2:42:33.780 --> 2:42:38.940\n what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish, saying the chaotic dynamics of this paper\n\n2:42:38.940 --> 2:42:43.380\n should warn us against regarding a period of relative stability in a capitalist economy\n\n2:42:43.380 --> 2:42:45.580\n as anything more than a lull before the storm.\n\n2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:50.140\n Now I thought it was a great speed of rhetoric, I didn't think it was going to fucking happen.\n\n2:42:50.140 --> 2:42:56.360\n But it did, because you had this period from 1990 through to 2007 where there were diminishing\n\n2:42:56.360 --> 2:43:00.420\n cycles, and the neoclassicals labeled that the Great Moderation, and they took the credit\n\n2:43:00.420 --> 2:43:01.420\n for it.\n\n2:43:01.420 --> 2:43:06.500\n They thought that the economy was being managed by them to a lower rate of inflation, a lower\n\n2:43:06.500 --> 2:43:11.460\n level of unemployment, less instability over time, and they literally took credit for it.\n\n2:43:11.460 --> 2:43:14.980\n And I was watching that and thinking, that's like my model running, and I'm scared as\n\n2:43:14.980 --> 2:43:17.540\n shit that there'll be a breakdown.\n\n2:43:17.540 --> 2:43:23.380\n I ended up not working in the area for a while because I wrote Debunking Economics, and I\n\n2:43:23.380 --> 2:43:28.780\n got involved in a fight over the modeling of competition in neoclassical theory that\n\n2:43:28.780 --> 2:43:31.340\n took me away for about four or five years.\n\n2:43:31.340 --> 2:43:40.260\n And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005, end of 2005, and I used Minsky as my\n\n2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:44.880\n framework for arguing that somebody who was involved in predatory lending should be able\n\n2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:47.460\n to get out of the debt they were in.\n\n2:43:47.460 --> 2:43:52.700\n And I explained Minsky's theory, and I used this throwaway line of saying debt levels\n\n2:43:52.700 --> 2:43:55.860\n of private debt have been rising exponentially.\n\n2:43:55.860 --> 2:43:59.380\n And then I thought, well, I can't, as an expert, just make a claim like that.\n\n2:43:59.380 --> 2:44:01.380\n I've got to check the data.\n\n2:44:01.380 --> 2:44:05.700\n And the debt ratio was rising exponentially, and I thought, holy shit, we're in for a financial\n\n2:44:05.700 --> 2:44:10.860\n crisis, and somebody has to warn about it, and at least in Australia, I was that somebody.\n\n2:44:10.860 --> 2:44:16.700\n So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea, can you talk about the crises ahead of us\n\n2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:17.700\n in the future?\n\n2:44:17.700 --> 2:44:21.820\n So one of the things, I mean, it's a fundamental question of economics.\n\n2:44:21.820 --> 2:44:26.380\n Is economics about understanding the past or predicting the future?\n\n2:44:26.380 --> 2:44:37.540\n Because you can construct models that do poetic, like in 95, poetic, you know, yeah, and then\n\n2:44:37.540 --> 2:44:43.860\n you can, you know, watch years fly by, and some of the predictions in retrospect that\n\n2:44:43.860 --> 2:44:49.980\n you make turn out to be true, but, you know, all kinds of gurus throughout history have\n\n2:44:49.980 --> 2:44:54.860\n done that kind of thing, and you can call yourself right and forget all the many times\n\n2:44:54.860 --> 2:44:56.460\n you've been wrong.\n\n2:44:56.460 --> 2:44:57.840\n Let's talk about the future.\n\n2:44:57.840 --> 2:45:02.540\n What kind of stuff, you mentioned about the importance of the biosphere, but what are\n\n2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:10.660\n the crises that are ahead of us that a chaotic dynamics view allows us to predict and be\n\n2:45:10.660 --> 2:45:11.660\n concerned about?\n\n2:45:11.660 --> 2:45:17.980\n Getting out of it, leaving aside the ecological, wasn't a crisis, it was stagnation.\n\n2:45:17.980 --> 2:45:23.300\n Because what we got out of the crisis was caused by a rising level of private debt.\n\n2:45:23.300 --> 2:45:29.700\n Now you reach a peak level where the willingness to take on debt collapses.\n\n2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:32.940\n And so you go to a period where debt is rising all the time.\n\n2:45:32.940 --> 2:45:38.300\n So credit, which is the annual change in debt, and that's credit as part of aggregate demand\n\n2:45:38.300 --> 2:45:39.980\n and aggregate income.\n\n2:45:39.980 --> 2:45:44.740\n So credit goes from positive to negative, and that causes a slump.\n\n2:45:44.740 --> 2:45:47.060\n So can you describe why that causes a slump?\n\n2:45:47.060 --> 2:45:49.420\n So credit goes to negative.\n\n2:45:49.420 --> 2:45:53.180\n If you ask Paul Krugman, he'll tell you credit plays no role in aggregate demand.\n\n2:45:53.180 --> 2:45:55.960\n Give me a second.\n\n2:45:55.960 --> 2:45:58.780\n Credit plays no role in aggregate demand.\n\n2:45:58.780 --> 2:46:02.660\n So the vision that the neoclassicals have for the banking system is what they call learnable\n\n2:46:02.660 --> 2:46:03.660\n funds.\n\n2:46:03.660 --> 2:46:10.460\n Is Paul Krugman, by the way, the knight at the front of the army that is the neoclassical\n\n2:46:10.460 --> 2:46:11.460\n economist?\n\n2:46:11.460 --> 2:46:12.460\n Yeah, fundamentally.\n\n2:46:12.460 --> 2:46:13.460\n Sure.\n\n2:46:13.460 --> 2:46:14.460\n Okay.\n\n2:46:14.460 --> 2:46:21.360\n He's politically reasonable, which makes him more dangerous than those that aren't.\n\n2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:22.360\n He's politically...\n\n2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:25.660\n Yeah, there's quite a lot of people that would disagree with that characterization of Paul\n\n2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:28.300\n Krugman as he's politically reasonable.\n\n2:46:28.300 --> 2:46:29.300\n You should see the people behind him.\n\n2:46:29.300 --> 2:46:30.300\n The alternatives.\n\n2:46:30.300 --> 2:46:31.300\n Okay.\n\n2:46:31.300 --> 2:46:32.300\n Fair enough.\n\n2:46:32.300 --> 2:46:33.300\n Okay.\n\n2:46:33.300 --> 2:46:36.420\n So he's not a negative or positive statement, that's just he can be feisty as well.\n\n2:46:36.420 --> 2:46:37.420\n Oh, he can.\n\n2:46:37.420 --> 2:46:38.420\n He can.\n\n2:46:38.420 --> 2:46:40.780\n But he's like the human face of neoclassical economics.\n\n2:46:40.780 --> 2:46:43.020\n It doesn't deserve having a human face.\n\n2:46:43.020 --> 2:46:45.260\n It's anti human theory.\n\n2:46:45.260 --> 2:46:46.260\n But he's the human face.\n\n2:46:46.260 --> 2:46:47.260\n Tell me what you really think.\n\n2:46:47.260 --> 2:46:48.260\n I got you.\n\n2:46:48.260 --> 2:46:49.260\n All right.\n\n2:46:49.260 --> 2:46:54.300\n Well, so but the credit does not have any effect on aggregate demand.\n\n2:46:54.300 --> 2:46:55.300\n In their model.\n\n2:46:55.300 --> 2:46:56.900\n And you're saying that's not the case at all.\n\n2:46:56.900 --> 2:46:59.000\n It's absolutely crucial to aggregate demand.\n\n2:46:59.000 --> 2:47:03.420\n So what they model is, again, the example of you lending to me or vice versa.\n\n2:47:03.420 --> 2:47:07.660\n If I lend money to you, I can spend less, you can spend more.\n\n2:47:07.660 --> 2:47:11.020\n So credit is the change in debt.\n\n2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:17.100\n So if I lend money to you, then there's a level of private debt rises.\n\n2:47:17.100 --> 2:47:19.000\n So there's an increase in credit.\n\n2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:22.820\n But that increase in credit comes at an expense of my spending power.\n\n2:47:22.820 --> 2:47:26.860\n So you can spend what I've lent you, but I can't spend what I've lent you.\n\n2:47:26.860 --> 2:47:28.700\n So credit cancels out.\n\n2:47:28.700 --> 2:47:30.600\n When you look at that's learnable funds.\n\n2:47:30.600 --> 2:47:34.180\n But in the real world, and the Bank of England has said this is the real world and the textbooks\n\n2:47:34.180 --> 2:47:38.900\n are wrong categorically in 2014.\n\n2:47:38.900 --> 2:47:43.940\n When the bank lends, it adds to its asset side and says, you owe us more money.\n\n2:47:43.940 --> 2:47:47.340\n And it adds to its liability side and says, here's the money in your bank account.\n\n2:47:47.340 --> 2:47:49.420\n Now you spend that money.\n\n2:47:49.420 --> 2:47:54.380\n So what happens when you do your sums, credit is part of aggregate demand and aggregate\n\n2:47:54.380 --> 2:47:55.380\n income.\n\n2:47:55.380 --> 2:48:02.160\n And that's something I first solved in 2019, I think, 2000, I only recently proved it mathematically.\n\n2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:08.540\n So what that means is credit is a component of aggregate demand, and credit is also very\n\n2:48:08.540 --> 2:48:09.540\n volatile.\n\n2:48:09.540 --> 2:48:14.140\n It's like consumption demand never goes negative, investment demand never goes negative, but\n\n2:48:14.140 --> 2:48:15.700\n credit can go from positive to negative.\n\n2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:21.620\n And when you take a look at the long run of American history after the Second World War,\n\n2:48:21.620 --> 2:48:26.740\n there was no period until 2007 where credit was negative.\n\n2:48:26.740 --> 2:48:34.000\n It was a positive number, therefore, when you do it as a percentage of GDP, it was a\n\n2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.360\n positive percentage of GDP.\n\n2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:42.840\n It peaked at 16% of GDP in 2006, 2007.\n\n2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:47.500\n It fell to minus 5% in 2008, 2009.\n\n2:48:47.500 --> 2:48:51.980\n So you had a 20% of GDP turnaround in aggregate demand.\n\n2:48:51.980 --> 2:49:00.060\n Now when you plot that against unemployment, the correlation of credit to unemployment\n\n2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:09.300\n across the period from about 1990 to 2010 is about minus 0.9, okay?\n\n2:49:09.300 --> 2:49:10.520\n Enormous negative correlation.\n\n2:49:10.520 --> 2:49:14.380\n Now according to the neoclassicals, it should be close to zero.\n\n2:49:14.380 --> 2:49:16.180\n Empirically it's bleedingly obvious it's not.\n\n2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:21.540\n And it applies to every country in the world that had a financial crisis at that period.\n\n2:49:21.540 --> 2:49:24.740\n So it's bleedingly obvious in the data.\n\n2:49:24.740 --> 2:49:28.180\n And they ignore it because credit's not part of their model.\n\n2:49:28.180 --> 2:49:29.180\n And you're saying it's causation.\n\n2:49:29.180 --> 2:49:31.900\n It is causal.\n\n2:49:31.900 --> 2:49:35.980\n Today we sit there, it's extremely high inflation.\n\n2:49:35.980 --> 2:49:41.500\n What role does inflation play in this picture?\n\n2:49:41.500 --> 2:49:43.060\n Is a little bit of inflation good?\n\n2:49:43.060 --> 2:49:48.380\n We talked about money creation at the beginning.\n\n2:49:48.380 --> 2:49:50.500\n What's a little bit of inflation good or bad?\n\n2:49:50.500 --> 2:49:52.220\n A lot of inflation good or bad?\n\n2:49:52.220 --> 2:49:53.220\n How concerned are you about?\n\n2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:57.420\n A little bit is good for a simple reason that, like again, it's taken me a while to get my\n\n2:49:57.420 --> 2:49:58.720\n head around this.\n\n2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:01.500\n But if you think about how people say, what are the functions of money?\n\n2:50:01.500 --> 2:50:04.780\n They say money, it's a unit of account, so you're measuring.\n\n2:50:04.780 --> 2:50:06.980\n It's a means of exchange, okay?\n\n2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:09.300\n And it's a store of value, okay?\n\n2:50:09.300 --> 2:50:15.060\n Now yes, okay, it has those three roles, but the last one is contradictory to the previous\n\n2:50:15.060 --> 2:50:16.060\n two.\n\n2:50:16.060 --> 2:50:20.440\n Because, and this is where you see this with the Bitcoin phenomenon, if you want to hang\n\n2:50:20.440 --> 2:50:29.740\n onto money as a store of value, then if prices are falling, the value of money is rising.\n\n2:50:29.740 --> 2:50:35.340\n And it's actually in your interests as a store of value to hang onto it and not spend it.\n\n2:50:35.340 --> 2:50:39.280\n So that contradicts its role as a means of exchange.\n\n2:50:39.280 --> 2:50:44.320\n Now if you have money which depreciates, and this was actually tried in the Austrian town\n\n2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:48.420\n of Wargel during the Great Depression.\n\n2:50:48.420 --> 2:50:53.300\n If you have money that depreciates, then if you don't use it, you lose it fundamentally.\n\n2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:55.500\n So it has a high rate of circulation.\n\n2:50:55.500 --> 2:51:01.740\n So there's a monetary theorist called Silvio Gazzell, and he wrote this proposal that money\n\n2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:03.940\n should depreciate.\n\n2:51:03.940 --> 2:51:09.640\n And he was ridiculed and opposed and derided, but Keynes said he was a great intellect.\n\n2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:15.660\n And the mayor of the town of Wargel in Austria during the Great Depression was facing an\n\n2:51:15.660 --> 2:51:18.760\n unemployment rate of 25% pretty much.\n\n2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:23.700\n Germany had the worst experience in the Great Depression in the world, as bad as America,\n\n2:51:23.700 --> 2:51:25.600\n slightly worse than America.\n\n2:51:25.600 --> 2:51:28.600\n And so he thought, how can I stimulate demand here?\n\n2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:33.500\n So he produced a script which could only be used for buying goods and services in Wargel.\n\n2:51:33.500 --> 2:51:37.460\n And it could be used to pay your local rates.\n\n2:51:37.460 --> 2:51:41.460\n But it was depreciated by putting a stamp on the money if you didn't use it.\n\n2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:45.720\n So what happened was people would pay their rates, they needed to pay the rates using\n\n2:51:45.720 --> 2:51:49.180\n this money, so the script, so they used the script.\n\n2:51:49.180 --> 2:51:52.760\n And because it depreciated, you'd use it rapidly.\n\n2:51:52.760 --> 2:51:58.240\n So people were using that money, this alternative to the Austrian shilling, and the economic\n\n2:51:58.240 --> 2:52:02.040\n activity in town took off, and unemployment fell to zero.\n\n2:52:02.040 --> 2:52:06.040\n And it was an absolute miracle, and everybody loved a Wargel experiment, and the Austrian\n\n2:52:06.040 --> 2:52:12.160\n central bank sued them for establishing an alternative form of money and shut it down.\n\n2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:20.280\n Unemployment went back up to 25% again, and Austria voted 99.6% for the Nazis, something\n\n2:52:20.280 --> 2:52:22.920\n crazy number like that when Hitler marched in.\n\n2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:29.720\n So the Wargel experiment showed that a depreciating currency led to a high rate of circulation.\n\n2:52:29.720 --> 2:52:33.700\n But of course, we're not talking Weimar Republic levels of inflation.\n\n2:52:33.700 --> 2:52:40.340\n So when you get that much inflation, and that's normally caused by, as the Weimar inflation\n\n2:52:40.340 --> 2:52:46.080\n was caused by, the reparation terms imposed on Germany, fundamentally by France at the\n\n2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:52.140\n Treaty of Versailles, they paid a large part of that with just basically printing the notes,\n\n2:52:52.140 --> 2:52:54.900\n and you went into this crazy period of hyperinflation.\n\n2:52:54.900 --> 2:52:58.480\n So hyperinflation almost always occurs when there's a massive destruction of physical\n\n2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:03.040\n resources, and the monetary authority tries to paper, literally, over it, and then you\n\n2:53:03.040 --> 2:53:05.760\n get hyperinflation, that's total social breakdown.\n\n2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:12.560\n So a moderate level of inflation inspires the means of exchange usage of money, but\n\n2:53:12.560 --> 2:53:17.560\n undermines the store of value usage of money.\n\n2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:22.760\n And that dilemma is why we have this antagonistic attitude towards inflation.\n\n2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:31.120\n Yeah, I mean, you're describing it as a tension, but it nevertheless is, like money is a store\n\n2:53:31.120 --> 2:53:36.600\n of value and a means of exchange, and I don't, you know, to push back, it's not necessarily\n\n2:53:36.600 --> 2:53:42.360\n that there's a tension, it's just that depending on the dynamics of this beautiful economic\n\n2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:45.800\n system of ours, it's used as one more than the other.\n\n2:53:45.800 --> 2:53:53.380\n If there's inflation, you're using it more for the means of exchange, there's deflation\n\n2:53:53.380 --> 2:53:57.560\n using more for store of value, but that doesn't, I don't see that as a tension, that's just\n\n2:53:57.560 --> 2:54:00.800\n a, how much you use it for those different, like...\n\n2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:07.240\n But it ends up saying that overall, the level of effective commerce, a bit of inflation\n\n2:54:07.240 --> 2:54:11.400\n is a good thing, because that's depreciating the money slightly and encourage its use.\n\n2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:20.400\n Yeah, but so the argument that some Bitcoin folks use or gold standard folks, again, HODL\n\n2:54:20.400 --> 2:54:29.320\n is not an argument, is that having an inflation of zero is actually achieving that balance.\n\n2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:30.320\n Yeah.\n\n2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:31.320\n Right?\n\n2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:32.320\n So like, yeah.\n\n2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:36.200\n But they're actually in favor of negative, they want it to be appreciated rapidly, and\n\n2:54:36.200 --> 2:54:42.980\n because of the negative inflation, the value of the money rising relative to commodities,\n\n2:54:42.980 --> 2:54:45.480\n that's what they want, that's the HODL philosophy.\n\n2:54:45.480 --> 2:54:50.380\n Well, that's more of like an investment, I don't know if that, that's more of investment\n\n2:54:50.380 --> 2:54:55.680\n philosophy than the fundamental principles of why they believe in cryptocurrency, in\n\n2:54:55.680 --> 2:54:58.140\n forced scarcity, it's a model.\n\n2:54:58.140 --> 2:55:04.040\n The concern there is that when you print money, the public policy is detached from the actual\n\n2:55:04.040 --> 2:55:06.480\n value.\n\n2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:12.720\n Yeah, well, I mean, this is where, again, it matters to get money creation right, because\n\n2:55:12.720 --> 2:55:19.000\n the government's not the only money creator, banks are as well, private banks.\n\n2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:25.160\n And if we obsess too much about limiting government money creation, what we end up getting, if\n\n2:55:25.160 --> 2:55:28.920\n there is money creation going on, it's private banks doing it, and you get an increase in\n\n2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:36.720\n private debt, and fundamentally, private debt and its collapse, the collapse of credit,\n\n2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:41.200\n when it stops growing, that's the fundamental cause of financial crises.\n\n2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:46.240\n So yeah, but the question is, what's the cause for the collapse of the...\n\n2:55:46.240 --> 2:55:51.820\n Well, I think this is like the Austrian thinking leaves out the debt deflation.\n\n2:55:51.820 --> 2:55:56.640\n And that's like, I think one of the most important papers ever written was by Irving Fisher called\n\n2:55:56.640 --> 2:55:59.640\n the Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions.\n\n2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:02.640\n Fisher was somebody who accepted the neoclassical vision.\n\n2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:09.300\n He wrote the pre Efficiency Market Hypothesis, Efficiency Market Hypothesis.\n\n2:56:09.300 --> 2:56:14.680\n He had his own PhD called the Theory of Interest.\n\n2:56:14.680 --> 2:56:21.940\n And in that, he argued effectively for a supply and demand analysis of the financial system.\n\n2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:27.480\n And he argued for equilibrium, he said when you're working with a commodity market, then\n\n2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:35.040\n the sale and the transaction and the exchange occur at the same point in time.\n\n2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:39.520\n When you're working with the financial market, then the exchange occurs through time.\n\n2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:46.680\n So he said he assumed that debts are repaid, all debts are repaid, and he assumed that\n\n2:56:46.680 --> 2:56:50.200\n equilibrium through time was an essential part of his assumption.\n\n2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:54.680\n This is...and then the Great Depression comes along.\n\n2:56:54.680 --> 2:57:00.640\n And he has become a major shareholder in the rank Xerox because he invented the Roller\n\n2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:01.640\n Dex.\n\n2:57:01.640 --> 2:57:03.600\n He's a tinkerer.\n\n2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:09.720\n And so he had taken out shares on margin, and he was worth about 100 million in modern\n\n2:57:09.720 --> 2:57:12.480\n terms when the Great Depression hit.\n\n2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:14.920\n And 90% of that was share market valuation.\n\n2:57:14.920 --> 2:57:18.120\n He'd taken out margin debt just like everybody else.\n\n2:57:18.120 --> 2:57:24.120\n And with margin debt, you could put down $100,000 and buy a million dollars worth of shares.\n\n2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:27.120\n So you got this huge leverage into debt.\n\n2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:30.720\n Now that when the financial crisis hit, the level of margin debt in America had risen\n\n2:57:30.720 --> 2:57:38.660\n from half a percent of GDP in 1920 to 13% of GDP in 1929.\n\n2:57:38.660 --> 2:57:40.460\n It then fell to zero again.\n\n2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:46.520\n That's why the stock market crash in 1929 was so devastating, that scale of margin lending.\n\n2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:49.960\n And everybody was being wiped out, they were selling Rolls Royces for 20 quid.\n\n2:57:49.960 --> 2:57:52.400\n You literally have photographs showing people doing that.\n\n2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:56.500\n Because a margin call comes in, you've got to liquidate everything.\n\n2:57:56.500 --> 2:58:02.180\n So he said the danger of a debt deflation is what we have to avoid.\n\n2:58:02.180 --> 2:58:08.360\n And that means you don't want too much private debt to accumulate, and you don't want falling\n\n2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:14.680\n prices because the falling prices will amplify the impact of being insolvent to begin with.\n\n2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:16.800\n And that's what we saw in the Great Depression.\n\n2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:19.720\n It's partially what we saw in 2007.\n\n2:58:19.720 --> 2:58:23.360\n But we didn't have anything like the level of margin debt.\n\n2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:29.100\n Margin debt was reduced from 90% to 50% ratio after the Great Depression.\n\n2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:33.200\n So there were limits on how bad it was in 2007.\n\n2:58:33.200 --> 2:58:37.960\n But the danger is still the period of deflation amplifies your debts.\n\n2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:38.960\n Okay.\n\n2:58:38.960 --> 2:58:42.260\n And I call it Fisher's Paradox, he didn't write those terms himself.\n\n2:58:42.260 --> 2:58:46.080\n But he wrote a line saying the more debtors pay, the more they owe.\n\n2:58:46.080 --> 2:58:47.080\n Okay.\n\n2:58:47.080 --> 2:58:52.360\n And this is because you're liquidating to try to meet your own debts.\n\n2:58:52.360 --> 2:58:55.080\n When you liquidate, the price level falls.\n\n2:58:55.080 --> 2:59:00.280\n You will end up having a lower level of monetary debt, but a higher level of debt when you\n\n2:59:00.280 --> 2:59:02.360\n deflate it using the price level.\n\n2:59:02.360 --> 2:59:08.000\n So the biggest danger in capitalism is the debt deflation, far more dangerous than inflation.\n\n2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:11.040\n And the cause of debt deflation is?\n\n2:59:11.040 --> 2:59:12.040\n Too much lending.\n\n2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:13.040\n Too much bank lending.\n\n2:59:13.040 --> 2:59:14.520\n Too much private money creation.\n\n2:59:14.520 --> 2:59:21.200\n And if you take a look at the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge explained the boom of the 1920s on\n\n2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:22.200\n his surplus.\n\n2:59:22.200 --> 2:59:28.040\n He said, my government running a surplus of 1% of GDP pretty much from 1922 through to\n\n2:59:28.040 --> 2:59:30.600\n 1930 is the foundation of our stability.\n\n2:59:30.600 --> 2:59:32.040\n It should be continued.\n\n2:59:32.040 --> 2:59:37.440\n What he didn't look at was that over that same time period, on average, Americans were\n\n2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:42.320\n borrowing 5% of GDP per year from the private banks.\n\n2:59:42.320 --> 2:59:46.480\n So you had a housing bubble at the beginning of the 1920s, which Richard Vague covers beautifully\n\n2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:49.720\n in the brief history of doom.\n\n2:59:49.720 --> 2:59:54.480\n And then you had this huge rise in margin debt as well, gigantic increase in margin\n\n2:59:54.480 --> 2:59:55.640\n debt.\n\n2:59:55.640 --> 2:59:59.280\n So all this borrowed money was being spent into the economy, and this is where credit\n\n2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:01.020\n becomes part of aggregate demand.\n\n3:00:01.020 --> 3:00:05.760\n And it's both not just for goods and services, it's also for shares and houses and so on.\n\n3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:07.960\n So a huge valuation effect.\n\n3:00:07.960 --> 3:00:13.280\n But then when the margin debt turned around, when people would not take out margin debt\n\n3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:16.160\n anymore, the demand for margin debt disappeared.\n\n3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:21.940\n And then it was, you know, what we call badly a positive feedback loop is actually an amplifying\n\n3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:22.940\n feedback loop.\n\n3:00:22.940 --> 3:00:25.200\n And that caused a collapse.\n\n3:00:25.200 --> 3:00:30.260\n So what elements of that do you see today that we need to fix and how do we fix it?\n\n3:00:30.260 --> 3:00:35.500\n We have to regard the level of private debt as a target of economic policy, just as much\n\n3:00:35.500 --> 3:00:38.760\n as the rate of inflation or the rate of unemployment.\n\n3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:41.400\n What is the moderate amount of private debt that's good?\n\n3:00:41.400 --> 3:00:45.320\n I would say something of anywhere between 30 and 70% of GDP.\n\n3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:47.320\n What is it currently?\n\n3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:50.240\n In America, it's 170%.\n\n3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:51.720\n Nice.\n\n3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:52.720\n Of GDP.\n\n3:00:52.720 --> 3:00:53.720\n Of GDP.\n\n3:00:53.720 --> 3:00:54.720\n Oh, that's nice.\n\n3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:57.700\n I've got, we'll have to talk after we talk, but I can show you the data in this.\n\n3:00:57.700 --> 3:01:04.560\n And it is just this huge increase in private debt that first of all caused the boom, but\n\n3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:10.080\n then financing the credit causes, ultimately causes the slump.\n\n3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:16.360\n And so if we remove the rate level at which debt can reach and we stop speculative lending\n\n3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:23.400\n and basically have a lending for both innovation, investment and essential consumption items,\n\n3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:25.800\n we won't have the slump on the other side.\n\n3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:27.500\n We can get rid of financial instability.\n\n3:01:27.500 --> 3:01:31.620\n We can't stop financial cycles, but we can stop financial breakdown.\n\n3:01:31.620 --> 3:01:35.380\n So we should really be focusing on the instability and getting that under control.\n\n3:01:35.380 --> 3:01:40.960\n By the way, as you point to your laptop, my laptops, I have a lot of, how many computers\n\n3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:41.960\n do I have?\n\n3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:45.920\n I have a lot of them, but my little Surface, whatever the heck this thing is, is getting\n\n3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:50.240\n definite size envy because your laptop, you said is 18 something inches.\n\n3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:51.240\n 18.4 inches.\n\n3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:52.240\n 18.4 inches.\n\n3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:59.560\n I don't think I've ever seen one that big and I'll give the internet that one.\n\n3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:00.780\n All right.\n\n3:02:00.780 --> 3:02:01.780\n That's for the graphics.\n\n3:02:01.780 --> 3:02:02.780\n So it's a gaming laptop.\n\n3:02:02.780 --> 3:02:03.780\n It's a gaming laptop.\n\n3:02:03.780 --> 3:02:04.780\n It's basically a desktop.\n\n3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:08.160\n It probably weighs like 40 pounds and you have to.\n\n3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:09.160\n Eight kilos?\n\n3:02:09.160 --> 3:02:10.160\n Eight kilos.\n\n3:02:10.160 --> 3:02:11.160\n Let's see.\n\n3:02:11.160 --> 3:02:12.160\n You reckon eight or?\n\n3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:13.160\n Oh wow.\n\n3:02:13.160 --> 3:02:14.160\n Okay.\n\n3:02:14.160 --> 3:02:15.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:15.160 --> 3:02:16.160\n Okay.\n\n3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:17.160\n Eight kilos.\n\n3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:18.160\n That's, you know, you're pushing 40 pounds.\n\n3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:19.160\n You've seen the power supply for it?\n\n3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:20.160\n It's over there somewhere.\n\n3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:21.160\n The power supply weighs about twice as much as your laptop.\n\n3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:22.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:23.800\n And you have to power it on with a crank.\n\n3:02:23.800 --> 3:02:24.800\n Pretty close.\n\n3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:25.800\n You have to like pull it.\n\n3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:26.800\n Is it gas powered or is it coal?\n\n3:02:26.800 --> 3:02:29.800\n Oh, well, I feel like it's a nuclear power station.\n\n3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:30.800\n Nuclear.\n\n3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:31.800\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:32.800\n A nuclear diamond in the back there.\n\n3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:33.800\n Okay.\n\n3:02:33.800 --> 3:02:41.440\n So let me, before I forget, just let me ask you about, we've covered brilliantly the\n\n3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:46.240\n nuanced disagreements you have and the wisdom you've drawn from Karl Marx.\n\n3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:54.920\n But there's also, like you mentioned in popular discourse, a kind of a distorted use of different\n\n3:02:54.920 --> 3:02:58.000\n terms and one of them is Marxism today.\n\n3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:05.620\n Is there something you could just speak to about, you know, increased use of that word\n\n3:03:05.620 --> 3:03:06.620\n and is it misused?\n\n3:03:06.620 --> 3:03:10.640\n Does it concern you that there's a lot of actually young people that say they're sort\n\n3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:12.640\n of proudly Marxist?\n\n3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:13.640\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:15.520\n Are they misusing the term?\n\n3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:20.240\n They are definitely misusing the term if they don't understand the use value exchange\n\n3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:23.640\n value dialectic I went through earlier.\n\n3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:24.640\n So if I could.\n\n3:03:24.640 --> 3:03:25.640\n And they don't.\n\n3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:33.160\n If I could just pause, the idea of socialism and Marxism is used in sort of popular lingo.\n\n3:03:33.160 --> 3:03:40.880\n It's basically, you know, a lot of people have a disproportionately hard life.\n\n3:03:40.880 --> 3:03:43.840\n Why can't we help them out?\n\n3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:46.560\n Why can't we be kind to our fellow man?\n\n3:03:46.560 --> 3:03:54.880\n Kind of that's a short embodiment of an idea as opposed to some super complicated elaborate\n\n3:03:54.880 --> 3:03:58.120\n model of the economy and politics and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:03:58.120 --> 3:03:59.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:02.880\n I mean, we could do that by using the insights that come out of modern monetary theory, which\n\n3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:06.200\n I've confirmed just using my simple Minsky models.\n\n3:04:06.200 --> 3:04:10.120\n And that is that, to use the term, usually a feature, not a bug.\n\n3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:16.680\n A government running a deficit is a feature of a well functioning mixed fiat credit economy,\n\n3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:17.680\n not a bug.\n\n3:04:17.680 --> 3:04:21.000\n The government should normally run a deficit because that's how the government creates\n\n3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:22.000\n money.\n\n3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.360\n We've also had this obsession from mainstream economists of running a surplus, which is\n\n3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:30.840\n what caused the Great Depression, Calvin Coolidge doing it for eight years.\n\n3:04:30.840 --> 3:04:34.760\n Because of that obsession, we've cut back on social services, we've cut back on health,\n\n3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:37.720\n we've cut back on education, we've cut back on infrastructure.\n\n3:04:37.720 --> 3:04:42.120\n Now all that stuff predominantly affects the poor because the rich can afford to buy it\n\n3:04:42.120 --> 3:04:43.120\n themselves.\n\n3:04:43.120 --> 3:04:47.520\n So if we had, Sonovich, realized that the government should run a deficit, it's a feature,\n\n3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:50.520\n not a bug of a fiat money system.\n\n3:04:50.520 --> 3:04:55.480\n And that's where Elon's made one mistake recently, I'm not going back to funded first principles.\n\n3:04:55.480 --> 3:05:01.760\n That deficit enables you to provide enough of a decent standard of living for those who\n\n3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:05.800\n don't come out on top in the capitalist game.\n\n3:05:05.800 --> 3:05:08.720\n And with that, you wouldn't have the angst of the young people.\n\n3:05:08.720 --> 3:05:15.200\n Now we still have the climate parameters within which we have to survive, but a decent level\n\n3:05:15.200 --> 3:05:18.560\n of government funding would mean the angst that you get where people say, I want to be\n\n3:05:18.560 --> 3:05:23.720\n a Marxist, and they've got what I call a cardboard cutout version of Marx in their minds.\n\n3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:25.500\n That wouldn't be happening.\n\n3:05:25.500 --> 3:05:32.400\n So it's potential to have a good society where the government runs a deficit that finances\n\n3:05:32.400 --> 3:05:38.760\n the needs of the poor, where the rich get enough to indulge and take care of themselves,\n\n3:05:38.760 --> 3:05:41.080\n and you don't get this breakdown.\n\n3:05:41.080 --> 3:05:44.760\n If you try to cause the government running a surplus, then the burden of that is borne\n\n3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:50.240\n by the poor, middle class and poor, and that will lead to the angst we're now seeing.\n\n3:05:50.240 --> 3:05:51.240\n LW.\n\n3:05:51.240 --> 3:05:52.240\n Beautiful.\n\n3:05:52.240 --> 3:05:59.480\n That was a beautiful whirlwind exploration of all of economics and economics history.\n\n3:05:59.480 --> 3:06:05.880\n Let me ask you, you tweeted, I think, we are the opposite of ants.\n\n3:06:05.880 --> 3:06:09.580\n Individually intelligent, collectively stupid.\n\n3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:17.240\n You need to develop systems thinking fast to counter our limitations.\n\n3:06:17.240 --> 3:06:19.000\n That's really interesting.\n\n3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.760\n Do you really believe we're individually intelligent and collectively stupid?\n\n3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:22.760\n RG.\n\n3:06:22.760 --> 3:06:23.760\n I do.\n\n3:06:23.760 --> 3:06:24.760\n LW.\n\n3:06:24.760 --> 3:06:25.760\n Can you elaborate?\n\n3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:27.960\n I mean, some of that is just cheeky tweets, but...\n\n3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:28.960\n RG.\n\n3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:31.360\n It's a cheeky tweet I've had in my mind for a long time.\n\n3:06:31.360 --> 3:06:36.000\n It's one that actually went moderately viral, not enough, but moderately viral for me.\n\n3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:37.000\n LW.\n\n3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:40.760\n Nevertheless, if you could analyze it as if it's some deep, profound statement you made\n\n3:06:40.760 --> 3:06:41.760\n in a book.\n\n3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:42.760\n RG.\n\n3:06:42.760 --> 3:06:46.040\n Well, the reason is that we are the incredibly individually intelligent, things like these\n\n3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:47.480\n devices we're playing with now.\n\n3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:48.480\n LW.\n\n3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:49.480\n That's the creation of individual minds.\n\n3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:50.480\n RG.\n\n3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:53.240\n Creative individual mind and a collective labor over centuries that led to this level\n\n3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:55.900\n of technology, and that has to be respected.\n\n3:06:55.900 --> 3:06:58.280\n It's incredible stuff.\n\n3:06:58.280 --> 3:07:02.720\n But at the same time, I think what humans are, if you want to distinguish humans from\n\n3:07:02.720 --> 3:07:08.560\n other species on the planet, we don't weave webs, okay, we don't make bird calls.\n\n3:07:08.560 --> 3:07:10.120\n What we do is we share beliefs.\n\n3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:11.120\n LW.\n\n3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:12.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:13.120\n RG.\n\n3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:14.120\n Okay.\n\n3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:15.120\n Now...\n\n3:07:15.120 --> 3:07:16.120\n LW.\n\n3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:17.120\n You don't think that's a catalyst for intelligence?\n\n3:07:17.120 --> 3:07:18.120\n RG.\n\n3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:19.120\n Yeah, it is a catalyst.\n\n3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:23.000\n But what it means is we can delude ourselves as much as we can inform ourselves.\n\n3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:27.200\n So because we share beliefs, we can do things in a collective way.\n\n3:07:27.200 --> 3:07:33.120\n And if we believe that if we take the incantations of the witch doctors and we happen to have\n\n3:07:33.120 --> 3:07:40.400\n a couple of spears and things, we can go and attack the local herd, a tribe of lions and\n\n3:07:40.400 --> 3:07:43.480\n drive them out, and we become the dominant species.\n\n3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:48.880\n So it works at the stage where we were in competition with other species on the planet.\n\n3:07:48.880 --> 3:07:53.280\n Now that we're the dominant species, then our beliefs get in the way.\n\n3:07:53.280 --> 3:08:00.480\n LW. So you agree with Einstein, who said there are only two things that are infinite, the\n\n3:08:00.480 --> 3:08:01.480\n universe and human stupidity.\n\n3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:02.480\n RG.\n\n3:08:02.480 --> 3:08:03.480\n And he wasn't sure about the universe.\n\n3:08:03.480 --> 3:08:04.480\n LW.\n\n3:08:04.480 --> 3:08:05.480\n And he wasn't sure about the universe.\n\n3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:06.480\n Right.\n\n3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:07.480\n That's right.\n\n3:08:07.480 --> 3:08:08.480\n And he wasn't sure about the universe.\n\n3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:14.720\n Yeah, so you think that the collective, I mean, there's an infinity to the destructive\n\n3:08:14.720 --> 3:08:20.000\n and the stupid, the inhumane that's possible when we humans get together, but it feels\n\n3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:24.480\n like there's more trajectories, there's more possibility for creation.\n\n3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:25.480\n RG.\n\n3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:26.480\n There are.\n\n3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:30.360\n I mean, I think that's why we have to, I say if we were built around the idea that our\n\n3:08:30.360 --> 3:08:37.480\n role as a species is to maintain and extend life on the planet and if not find it elsewhere,\n\n3:08:37.480 --> 3:08:43.400\n then seed it elsewhere, then that is a vision which makes us creative and confines the worst\n\n3:08:43.400 --> 3:08:46.720\n elements of our capacities to share beliefs.\n\n3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:51.920\n So that's what I, my hope is that we'll reach that stage, but I think we've overshot it\n\n3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:58.520\n so badly that my real fear is we'll end up blaming technology for the type of world we\n\n3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:01.160\n find ourselves living in in the next 20 to 50 years.\n\n3:09:01.160 --> 3:09:02.160\n LW.\n\n3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:05.160\n So you think technology is going to be one of the, part of the solution?\n\n3:09:05.160 --> 3:09:06.160\n RG.\n\n3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:07.160\n Part of the solution.\n\n3:09:07.160 --> 3:09:08.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:12.360\n But if we go through and blame it, which is quite possible, we'll blame the technology\n\n3:09:12.360 --> 3:09:16.200\n rather than blaming too much of the technology and the too much comes down to what economists\n\n3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:21.120\n have told us, that we can just continue consuming infinitely on a finite planet.\n\n3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:23.680\n And Kenneth Boulding said that beautifully.\n\n3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:27.840\n If somebody believes that you can have exponential growth on a finite planet, they're either\n\n3:09:27.840 --> 3:09:29.800\n mad or they're an economist.\n\n3:09:29.800 --> 3:09:30.800\n LW.\n\n3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:39.440\n So you're, you made a long journey for which I'm deeply honoured from, from, this distant\n\n3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:40.440\n place.\n\n3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:41.440\n RG.\n\n3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:42.440\n Antibodies.\n\n3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:43.440\n There's

forever.\n\n3:09:47.400 --> 3:09:48.400\n And so...\n\n3:09:48.400 --> 3:09:49.400\n LW.\n\n3:09:49.400 --> 3:09:51.600\n No, it's a bit too, there's more vitality back in this economy.\n\n3:09:51.600

not a fan of the economy or money or any of that.\n\n3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:02.240\n Nature calls me.\n\n3:10:02.240 --> 3:10:04.840\n Let me, so I'm honoured that you make that trip.\n\n3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:11.300\n You've also said that while you're here in Austin, you're going to go to this American\n\n3:10:11.300 --> 3:10:18.160\n factory that makes cars here in Austin and also visit Starbase.\n\n3:10:18.160 --> 3:10:22.320\n So let me ask you about expanding out into the universe.\n\n3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:25.280\n Is that something that excites you?\n\n3:10:25.280 --> 3:10:30.940\n You mentioned about the economics of it, do you think, what do you think Marx would think\n\n3:10:30.940 --> 3:10:31.940\n about this?\n\n3:10:31.940 --> 3:10:35.400\n Like what, economically speaking, what is this?\n\n3:10:35.400 --> 3:10:36.400\n Is it a good thing?\n\n3:10:36.400 --> 3:10:37.400\n LW.\n\n3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:38.400\n I think it's vital.\n\n3:10:38.400 --> 3:10:42.400\n I mean, we can have capitalism in outer space far more successfully than we can have it\n\n3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:46.480\n on the planet because we don't face, when we dump the waste, it ends up in the sun.\n\n3:10:46.480 --> 3:10:49.000\n Not a problem, okay?\n\n3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:54.620\n So it means the potential, we don't undermine our own productive capacity if we're doing\n\n3:10:54.620 --> 3:10:55.620\n it in outer space.\n\n3:10:55.620 --> 3:10:56.620\n RG.\n\n3:10:56.620 --> 3:10:59.600\n So the destructive element of waste has a lesser impact in outer space.\n\n3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:00.600\n LW.\n\n3:11:00.600 --> 3:11:01.600\n Far lesser, yeah.\n\n3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:03.600\n I mean, who cares if we throw a bit of our iron back into the sun again?\n\n3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:07.120\n It'd take a fair bit of it to turn it into what would be the next stage, it'd be a red\n\n3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:08.800\n giant.\n\n3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:12.500\n And we have to get away because if there's a red giant at some stage, the sun will head\n\n3:11:12.500 --> 3:11:16.840\n out past the orbit of Mars, I think, certainly past the orbit of Earth.\n\n3:11:16.840 --> 3:11:25.760\n So to have longevity of just human life, life that evolved on this planet, we have to be\n\n3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:28.240\n able to take it off planet, ultimately.\n\n3:11:28.240 --> 3:11:33.160\n So if you think in the really long term, then it's our responsibility, we're going to want\n\n3:11:33.160 --> 3:11:37.360\n to maintain life, is to establish life off the planet.\n\n3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:38.360\n LW.\n\n3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:43.800\n What do you think about robots and AI as part of the expanding out into the

production would be entirely mechanized.\n\n3:11:56.480 --> 3:11:59.640\n There'd have to be a handful of people who service the machines.\n\n3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:00.640\n LW.\n\n3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:02.320\n So it's about production and automation.\n\n3:12:02.320 --> 3:12:08.840\n What about elements of consciousness that make humans so special, what about that persisting\n\n3:12:08.840 -->

--> 3:12:25.200\n This is actually part of the, there's two good logical arguments against the labor theory\n\n3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:26.200\n of value.\n\n3:12:26.200 --> 3:12:30.200\n One of what it becomes, machines become intelligent, and the other was that if the declining rate\n\n3:12:30.200 --> 3:12:36.000\n of profit applies in socialism, it'll apply as a rate of accumulation, sorry, in capitalism,\n\n3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000\n it'll apply as a rate of socialism as well.\n\n3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:39.880\n A guy called Khalid made that argument.\n\n3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:42.500\n So his argument was just unsound.\n\n3:12:42.500 --> 3:12:45.720\n But yeah, intelligent machines would completely screw Marx up, you know?\n\n3:12:45.720 --> 3:12:46.720\n LW.\n\n3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:47.720\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:52.720\n Do you not like that world where machines have not only intelligence, but a consciousness,\n\n3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:53.720\n a soul?\n\n3:12:53.720 --> 3:12:54.720\n RG.\n\n3:12:54.720 --> 3:12:55.720\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:55.720 --> 3:13:01.800\n I know that's one of your interests, one of your potential endeavors, and the Kurtz will\n\n3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:05.720\n argue that there's some singularity we're approaching as we just get increasing processing\n\n3:13:05.720 --> 3:13:06.720\n power.\n\n3:13:06.720 --> 3:13:09.520\n It's not processing power, it's imagination.\n\n3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:10.520\n And I think\u2014\n\n3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:11.520\n LW.\n\n3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:12.520\n Whatever the heck that means.\n\n3:13:12.520 --> 3:13:13.520\n RG.\n\n3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:14.520\n Huh?\n\n3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:15.520\n Whatever the heck that means, yeah.\n\n3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:16.520\n I mean, you would have had imaginative insights.\n\n3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:23.680\n I mean, your papers on, like, in automating motoring between the hyperintelligent machine\n\n3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:28.360\n or the machine human interface where the standards can be lower for the machine and higher for\n\n3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:29.360\n the human, okay?\n\n3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:33.120\n That's an insight you would have had at some point, and then you've worked it further.\n\n3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:36.400\n So I've had insights like that as well, and I have no idea where they come from.\n\n3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:41.080\n They just hit me in the head, and I just write them down, and they solve a problem that I\n\n3:13:41.080 --> 3:13:43.680\n didn't even know my mind was working on, okay?\n\n3:13:43.680 --> 3:13:47.000\n So how can we get a machine to do that?\n\n3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:53.440\n And I do not know the answer, but one thing I think is the potential is I think we have\n\n3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:58.500\n to create AI that has feelings, AI that wants to survive.\n\n3:13:58.500 --> 3:14:04.000\n Because if you think how our intelligence evolved, it's on this planet in a struggle\n\n3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.640\n between predator and prey, and intelligent became a survival technique.\n\n3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:08.640\n LW.\n\n3:14:08.640 --> 3:14:15.640\n I find the ideas of Ernest Becker with denial of death really powerful, which is that humans\n\n3:14:15.640 --> 3:14:26.080\n not only have emotions and are trying to survive, they're able to ponder out in the distant\n\n3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:32.960\n future their mortality, and that is a driving force for even greater creation that animals\n\n3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:38.880\n are able to do, more primitive animals.\n\n3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:42.280\n So there is some element where I agree with you.\n\n3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:49.240\n I think for AI systems to have something like consciousness, they have to fear their mortality.\n\n3:14:49.240 --> 3:14:50.240\n LW.\n\n3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:51.240\n Exactly.\n\n3:14:51.240 --> 3:14:57.160\n And I think that's, if you do it then, you can't produce an AI whose behavior you can\n\n3:14:57.160 --> 3:14:58.160\n control.\n\n3:14:58.160 --> 3:14:59.160\n RL.\n\n3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:00.160\n I mean, when you have kids.\n\n3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:01.160\n LW.\n\n3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:02.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:03.160\n You're doing it.\n\n3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:04.160\n RL.\n\n3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:05.160\n You can't control their behavior.\n\n3:15:05.160 --> 3:15:06.160\n That's the tradeoff.\n\n3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:07.160\n LW.\n\n3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:08.160\n You give life to an anarchist.\n\n3:15:08.160 --> 3:15:14.120\n Like one of my favorite instances in my family life is one of my favorite, I like all my\n\n3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:19.840\n nurses and nephews, but one's got a real quirk to her, and I was standing over her cot when\n\n3:15:19.840 --> 3:15:24.680\n she was literally like about six months old, and she was gurgling away to herself.\n\n3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:28.920\n And her father waved his fingers and said, stop making that noise.\n\n3:15:28.920 --> 3:15:33.960\n And this little six month old kid goes, and I said, boy, you're going to have issues with\n\n3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:34.960\n that one, mate.\n\n3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:35.960\n RL.\n\n3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:36.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:37.960\n An anarchist was born.\n\n3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:38.960\n LW.\n\n3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:41.760\n So you can't control this life you give birth to, and that's, I think, the threat of AI.\n\n3:15:41.760 --> 3:15:42.760\n RL.\n\n3:15:42.760 --> 3:15:43.760\n That's terrifying and exciting.\n\n3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:44.760\n LW.\n\n3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:45.760\n It is.\n\n3:15:45.760 --> 3:15:47.520\n And I think we should take that risk at some stage.\n\n3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:53.600\n But I think to do it with what actually let artificial intelligence involve in this environment\n\n3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:55.800\n in which it fears its own death.\n\n3:15:55.800 --> 3:15:56.800\n RL.\n\n3:15:56.800 --> 3:15:57.800\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:57.800 --> 3:15:58.800\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:04.160\n I think there's a lot of beauty there, but there's also a lot of destruction that's possible.\n\n3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:09.200\n So you have to be extremely careful, but that's kind of the cutting edge of which we all often\n\n3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:12.080\n operate as a humanity.\n\n3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:13.680\n Let me ask you for advice.\n\n3:16:13.680 --> 3:16:19.720\n Can you give advice to young people in high school and college?\n\n3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:22.400\n Maybe they're interested in economics.\n\n3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:25.080\n Maybe they have other career ideas.\n\n3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:29.520\n What advice would you give them about a career they can have that they can be proud of or\n\n3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:31.040\n a life they can be proud of?\n\n3:16:31.040 --> 3:16:34.320\n LW. Mainly in a career, I say don't do an economics degree.\n\n3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:35.320\n Okay?\n\n3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:36.320\n I say if you...\n\n3:16:36.320 --> 3:16:37.320\n RL.\n\n3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:38.320\n There's a little book.\n\n3:16:38.320 --> 3:16:39.320\n LW.\n\n3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:40.320\n Econ Comics.\n\n3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:41.320\n RL.\n\n3:16:41.320 --> 3:16:45.880\n Econ Comics, Taking the Con Out of Economics.\n\n3:16:45.880 --> 3:16:50.520\n So they should start with that and then say screw it to an economics degree.\n\n3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:51.520\n LW.\n\n3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:54.540\n Yeah, because what you learn is an obsolete technology.\n\n3:16:54.540 --> 3:16:58.360\n Learning economics at a university is like learning to make astronomy.\n\n3:16:58.360 --> 3:16:59.360\n Okay?\n\n3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:06.600\n Earth centric, equilibrium, you know, epicycles being added to make your models fit the data.\n\n3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:07.600\n RL.\n\n3:17:07.600 --> 3:17:11.960\n So it's not that economics is not a discipline worth deeply studying, it's that the university\n\n3:17:11.960 --> 3:17:13.680\n education around economics is bad.\n\n3:17:13.680 --> 3:17:14.680\n LW.\n\n3:17:14.680 --> 3:17:15.680\n Is so bad.\n\n3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:16.680\n Yeah.\n\n3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:17.680\n So I'd say learn system dynamics.\n\n3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:21.920\n Do a course in system dynamics which you can apply in any field and then apply what you\n\n3:17:21.920 --> 3:17:26.160\n learn out of system dynamics to the issues of economics if that's what interests you.\n\n3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:27.160\n RL.\n\n3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:29.320\n So get a sort of base engineering...\n\n3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:30.320\n LW.\n\n3:17:30.320 --> 3:17:31.320\n Yeah.\n\n3:17:31.320 --> 3:17:32.320\n...education.\n\n3:17:32.320 --> 3:17:33.320\n RL.\n\n3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:34.320\n A base engineering education.\n\n3:17:34.320 --> 3:17:35.320\n That is far better than doing an economics degree.\n\n3:17:35.320 --> 3:17:40.160\n In terms of life, my life is pretty chaotic in many, many ways.\n\n3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:44.400\n My friends and family will tell me that at every opportunity.\n\n3:17:44.400 --> 3:17:48.720\n But the thing is, I once had a, I'll tell you an example of a really funny incident\n\n3:17:48.720 --> 3:17:51.920\n that occurred to me because I led this student revolt at Sydney University as I mentioned\n\n3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:52.920\n when I was 20 years old.\n\n3:17:52.920 --> 3:17:53.920\n LW.\n\n3:17:53.920 --> 3:17:54.920\n Yeah.\n\n3:17:54.920 --> 3:17:55.920\n This is great.\n\n3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:56.920\n RL.\n\n3:17:56.920 --> 3:18:01.420\n So I was at a restaurant one night and I found a bunch of guys, all guys, who'd done accounting\n\n3:18:01.420 --> 3:18:04.780\n at the university but had also been part of the student revolt.\n\n3:18:04.780 --> 3:18:07.920\n So they hadn't seen me for about a decade and they said, what have you been doing, Steve?\n\n3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:09.040\n And I talked about what I'd done.\n\n3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:10.760\n So I'd been a school teacher for a while.\n\n3:18:10.760 --> 3:18:13.320\n I then worked in overseas aid.\n\n3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:17.840\n I was doing computer programming at the time and had forgotten what else I was doing at\n\n3:18:17.840 --> 3:18:18.840\n that point.\n\n3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:21.100\n So I explained it to all of them and they were at a Bucks night, one of them having\n\n3:18:21.100 --> 3:18:23.520\n a wedding coming up the next week.\n\n3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:27.080\n And one of them said, I wish I'd done that.\n\n3:18:27.080 --> 3:18:31.400\n And there was silence around the table, it was obviously a silent agreement.\n\n3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:35.720\n And I looked at them and said, hang on, guys, look at the downside of my life.\n\n3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:41.840\n You know, like you're getting married, I don't have a girlfriend right now, you've all got\n\n3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:47.700\n secure jobs, I'm unemployed, okay, you own a house, I haven't even got a car, you know,\n\n3:18:47.700 --> 3:18:49.420\n look at the downside of my life.\n\n3:18:49.420 --> 3:18:53.080\n And the bloke was the kingpin of that group, they're a very innovative bunch of guys in\n\n3:18:53.080 --> 3:18:54.080\n the student revolt.\n\n3:18:54.080 --> 3:19:01.200\n And so he said, Steve, we would still all rather have done what you have done.\n\n3:19:01.200 --> 3:19:05.680\n And they did a county because it was safe, you always get a job, and they were bored\n\n3:19:05.680 --> 3:19:06.680\n shitless.\n\n3:19:06.680 --> 3:19:14.520\n Did you have a sense that the chaos you're always jumping into was dangerous or was it\n\n3:19:14.520 --> 3:19:16.880\n just the pull of it?\n\n3:19:16.880 --> 3:19:18.960\n I simply couldn't not do it.\n\n3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:22.160\n It was part of me that I couldn't swallow this economic stuff.\n\n3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:29.040\n Once I was exposed to why it was so wrong, then I was on a crusade to make it right.\n\n3:19:29.040 --> 3:19:32.840\n And that's been part of my nature all through my life, I don't know why.\n\n3:19:32.840 --> 3:19:37.880\n So it wasn't that I made a choice to do it, it's that I couldn't be true to myself without\n\n3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:38.880\n doing it.\n\n3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:42.260\n And I find a lot of people get caught in a life where they're doing it because it works\n\n3:19:42.260 --> 3:19:46.300\n for some financial or other reason, but they're not being true to themselves.\n\n3:19:46.300 --> 3:19:50.360\n And as messy as my life is, as much shit I've got myself caught up in, and there's a lot\n\n3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:55.600\n of that in my personal and financial life right now, which is a pain in the ass.\n\n3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:58.680\n I would rather have had that nature than not.\n\n3:19:58.680 --> 3:20:02.680\n You would rather take the pain in the ass than not.\n\n3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:06.080\n Let me ask a dark question.\n\n3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:09.800\n What's the darkest place you've ever gone to in your mind?\n\n3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:15.000\n So in all that rollercoaster of life, have there been periods where it's been really\n\n3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:16.000\n tough?\n\n3:20:16.000 --> 3:20:22.040\n I've had to cope with depression in the last five years since I started reading Neoclassical\n\n3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:23.480\n Economists on Climate Change.\n\n3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:24.480\n Sorry to laugh.\n\n3:20:24.480 --> 3:20:25.480\n Got to come back to that one.\n\n3:20:25.480 --> 3:20:28.120\n So that's where my wife's going to come into this story.\n\n3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:34.840\n So I was reading Richard Toll, a paper from 2009 called The Economics of Climate Change,\n\n3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:37.320\n Journal of Economic Perspectives, I think.\n\n3:20:37.320 --> 3:20:43.320\n And I read this section where he says that one of the ways they tried to calibrate what\n\n3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:48.440\n climate change was due is they assumed that the relationship between GDP and temperature\n\n3:20:48.440 --> 3:20:54.000\n over space would apply over time as well.\n\n3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:59.480\n And I read that and thought, that is so fucking stupid, because all it's saying is that if\n\n3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:03.720\n there's a 10 degree temperature difference between New York and Florida and a 20% difference\n\n3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:08.440\n in income, then a 10 degree increase in temperature will cause GDP to fall by 20%.\n\n3:21:08.440 --> 3:21:10.360\n It is so insanely stupid.\n\n3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:16.520\n So when I read that line, I just did this.\n\n3:21:16.520 --> 3:21:18.320\n I was in shock at how stupid it was.\n\n3:21:18.320 --> 3:21:25.220\n My wife, who's Thai and brings in treats for me all day, walks into the room and she speaks\n\n3:21:25.220 --> 3:21:29.380\n in a staccato English and says to me, why are you like this?\n\n3:21:29.380 --> 3:21:31.760\n And I said, I'm just doing this work on climate change.\n\n3:21:31.760 --> 3:21:35.160\n And she interrupts me and says, oh, why you do that stuff?\n\n3:21:35.160 --> 3:21:36.760\n Nobody's interested in climate change.\n\n3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:38.080\n You can't do anything to change it.\n\n3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:41.040\n If we die, we die.\n\n3:21:41.040 --> 3:21:44.360\n And that's perfect Buddhist grounding.\n\n3:21:44.360 --> 3:21:48.560\n And I thought, well, I can't argue with her again.\n\n3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:53.160\n So that sort of stopped me on the depression, but that's the darkest point when I looked\n\n3:21:53.160 --> 3:22:00.780\n at it and I thought that this arrogance, this stupidity, this humbug in the economists meant\n\n3:22:00.780 --> 3:22:05.120\n that we were potentially jeopardizing the lives of billions of people and Christ knows\n\n3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:08.060\n how many other life forms.\n\n3:22:08.060 --> 3:22:13.840\n And having that knowledge is the most depressing experience of my life.\n\n3:22:13.840 --> 3:22:23.360\n That ideas, simple models combined with arrogance can lead to the potential destruction of human\n\n3:22:23.360 --> 3:22:24.360\n civilization.\n\n3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:25.800\n That was a very heavy.\n\n3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:35.560\n And then your wife came in with Nature Wins in the End and sort of accept the flow of\n\n3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:36.560\n life.\n\n3:22:36.560 --> 3:22:40.120\n I really enjoy that book, The Earth Abides, because it's got that same beautiful sense\n\n3:22:40.120 --> 3:22:41.120\n to it.\n\n3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:42.800\n Life will survive whatever we do.\n\n3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:46.640\n I mean, they talk about the people, I was actually talking with a good mate of mine,\n\n3:22:46.640 --> 3:22:49.640\n an ex geologist, and he's now a professor of economics.\n\n3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:54.900\n And he said as a geologist, he really hated people talking about the Anthropocene epoch.\n\n3:22:54.900 --> 3:23:00.820\n And I said, well, it shouldn't be the Anthropocene epoch, it'll be the Anthropocene event.\n\n3:23:00.820 --> 3:23:06.960\n Anthropocene epoch is millions of years and a huge period of life on the planet.\n\n3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:12.360\n And we might be snuffed out in 10,000 years of human civilization.\n\n3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:16.760\n And that's not much slower than the meteors wiping out the dinosaurs.\n\n3:23:16.760 --> 3:23:19.480\n The dinosaurs lasted for a long time after that event.\n\n3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:26.840\n So we'd just be a layer in the surface of the planet with plastics and strange metals\n\n3:23:26.840 --> 3:23:29.100\n like that at some point.\n\n3:23:29.100 --> 3:23:30.100\n So we're just an epoch.\n\n3:23:30.100 --> 3:23:31.100\n Life will abide.\n\n3:23:31.100 --> 3:23:32.100\n Life will survive us.\n\n3:23:32.100 --> 3:23:37.360\n But there's so much life we're going to take down with us in this whole period.\n\n3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:43.000\n And there's so many of our own lives we're going to terminate for no good reason.\n\n3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:46.160\n I'm looking at this Richard Toll character.\n\n3:23:46.160 --> 3:23:48.120\n I'll definitely have to look at some of his papers.\n\n3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:52.920\n It does look like, boy, is he oversimplifying and do a lot of people.\n\n3:23:52.920 --> 3:23:53.920\n Oh my God.\n\n3:23:53.920 --> 3:23:57.520\n Check his one on how good it'll be to lose Amok.\n\n3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:03.200\n That said, I'm going to approach all of these topics with humility.\n\n3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:07.120\n And I would like to have some conversations if people can recommend.\n\n3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:12.280\n My default position is always with the scientists, but even above that, my default position is\n\n3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:16.960\n with those who are humble versus those who are arrogant.\n\n3:24:16.960 --> 3:24:21.760\n This idea that because you're a quote unquote expert, you deserve to have arrogance is a\n\n3:24:21.760 --> 3:24:23.240\n silly idea to me.\n\n3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:29.280\n Again, going to the broader view of life on earth, nature.\n\n3:24:29.280 --> 3:24:35.360\n Nature's the only one that gets to be arrogant and it chooses not to.\n\n3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:39.060\n So let me ask you about love.\n\n3:24:39.060 --> 3:24:41.760\n What role does love play in this whole thing?\n\n3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:43.760\n Did Karl Marx have a model for that?\n\n3:24:43.760 --> 3:24:48.800\n Oh, Marx was madly in love with Jenny von Westphalen and wrote love poetry to her long\n\n3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:51.260\n before he wrote Das Kapital.\n\n3:24:51.260 --> 3:24:52.560\n And he was infatuated with her.\n\n3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:57.040\n He ended up also impregnating his housekeeper.\n\n3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:02.800\n So there's a son of Karl Marx, who was the son of the housekeeper, not the Jenny.\n\n3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:05.640\n There are numerous daughters.\n\n3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:09.240\n So he had a complicated view of love.\n\n3:25:09.240 --> 3:25:10.240\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:12.520\n There's a dialectic on love there.\n\n3:25:12.520 --> 3:25:19.920\n He had an idealistic view with Jenny and he was rejected because he wasn't, not by Jenny,\n\n3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:22.000\n she was madly in love with him as well.\n\n3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:25.400\n So it was a real passionate love affair from the very outset.\n\n3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:28.600\n But then of course you have children, lots of them die.\n\n3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:31.200\n There's a huge amount of tragedy in his life as well.\n\n3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:37.200\n He and Jenny were forced out of Chelsea by a cholera epidemic.\n\n3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:43.600\n My vision for London back in the 1850s and 60s was Calcutta in the 1970s.\n\n3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:45.200\n That's really what life was like.\n\n3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:48.000\n So there's a lot of hardship in his life as well.\n\n3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:50.640\n And he was always poor.\n\n3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:54.760\n So only Ingalls kept him alive financially.\n\n3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:01.680\n He applied for one job outside of, he never got an academic job.\n\n3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:07.520\n He was pushed out of Prussia as a newspaper author, but he also applied for a job as a\n\n3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:15.360\n clerk in the British railway system, was turned down because they couldn't read his handwriting.\n\n3:26:15.360 --> 3:26:18.760\n I think I'm a bit similar there.\n\n3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:21.120\n So yeah, there's a lot of love and passion.\n\n3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:24.560\n But in general, what do you think is the role of love in the human condition?\n\n3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:25.560\n It's vital.\n\n3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:33.520\n It's, I mean, that feeling of passionate desire and respect for somebody else.\n\n3:26:33.520 --> 3:26:35.280\n And there's perverted forms of love as well.\n\n3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:42.520\n So I'll leave that out, but somebody having a really, a deep bond, which goes beyond just\n\n3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:43.520\n sexual attraction.\n\n3:26:43.520 --> 3:26:48.480\n Like I've had that four or five times in my life with different women at different times.\n\n3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:52.960\n And I've stuffed up the most important one very early on.\n\n3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:56.200\n And that feeling is incredible.\n\n3:26:56.200 --> 3:27:01.560\n And you couldn't have life worth living without that.\n\n3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:04.040\n So it's an essential part of who we are.\n\n3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:08.400\n But what we have to do is to transfer it, not just to the rest of our species, but to\n\n3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:10.500\n all the species.\n\n3:27:10.500 --> 3:27:12.920\n And that's, I think, what's vital.\n\n3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:16.880\n And how do we maintain that over generations?\n\n3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:22.200\n And I think that idea that we can actually hang on to that general sense of respect and\n\n3:27:22.200 --> 3:27:23.200\n not lose it again.\n\n3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:29.800\n Because the amount of life we've terminated on this planet, the warlike side of humanity,\n\n3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.920\n that is too much of a defining feature of our species.\n\n3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:35.160\n That's the opposite of love, it's hate.\n\n3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:37.180\n But it's pleasure and inflicting pain on others.\n\n3:27:37.180 --> 3:27:42.480\n When you see people killing others in a warlike environment, they're enjoying themselves.\n\n3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:44.720\n It's rarely, sometimes it's self defense.\n\n3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:49.720\n But there's, when I've spoken to people who've been involved in combat and been involved\n\n3:27:49.720 --> 3:27:54.860\n in riots and said, when you see somebody rioting, bashing people up, they're enjoying themselves.\n\n3:27:54.860 --> 3:27:56.800\n It's not anger they're feeling, it's pleasure.\n\n3:27:56.800 --> 3:27:58.600\n There's a dark aspect to human nature.\n\n3:27:58.600 --> 3:27:59.640\n Very dark.\n\n3:27:59.640 --> 3:28:04.620\n But there's also the capacity to rise above that.\n\n3:28:04.620 --> 3:28:08.840\n And I think, like I put us on a spectrum between chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos at\n\n3:28:08.840 --> 3:28:09.840\n the other.\n\n3:28:09.840 --> 3:28:12.760\n We're too close to the chimpanzees.\n\n3:28:12.760 --> 3:28:15.200\n Bonobos are just having fun, having lots of sex.\n\n3:28:15.200 --> 3:28:18.520\n Every time they do anything, they fuck first and do the work later and then fuck afterwards\n\n3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:19.520\n to celebrate.\n\n3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:21.640\n Fuck first, ask questions later.\n\n3:28:21.640 --> 3:28:27.280\n It's like that Scent of a Woman, one of my favorite films, where Al Pacino gives advice\n\n3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:28.280\n to a cat.\n\n3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:31.920\n He says, when in doubt, fuck.\n\n3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:36.120\n It's good life advice for a cat, especially.\n\n3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:42.080\n We mentioned that death seems to be maybe fundamental to creating a conscious AI.\n\n3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:47.640\n All right, do you think about your own death?\n\n3:28:47.640 --> 3:28:49.920\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:53.880\n I'm afraid of going through it.\n\n3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:54.880\n Not the other side?\n\n3:28:54.880 --> 3:28:55.880\n Huh?\n\n3:28:55.880 --> 3:28:56.880\n You're not afraid of being on the other side?\n\n3:28:56.880 --> 3:28:58.360\n I don't think there is an other side.\n\n3:28:58.360 --> 3:29:00.520\n I mean, I'm agnostic.\n\n3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:02.760\n I'm atheist when pressed and agnostic.\n\n3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:07.400\n The one thing that I think I can understand why religion exists is that the whole thing\n\n3:29:07.400 --> 3:29:11.260\n that something exists is itself a dilemma.\n\n3:29:11.260 --> 3:29:16.520\n You have to take on faith that reality exists, whether it's a simulation or actual reality,\n\n3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:20.480\n it exists, and that itself can't be explained in any scientific manner.\n\n3:29:20.480 --> 3:29:25.400\n I mean, you can talk about anti protons and protons and the sun being zero and so on,\n\n3:29:25.400 --> 3:29:27.700\n but why did it even happen in the first place?\n\n3:29:27.700 --> 3:29:31.780\n So there's part you simply have to take on faith.\n\n3:29:31.780 --> 3:29:36.600\n So there was darkness before, and there's darkness after.\n\n3:29:36.600 --> 3:29:39.560\n Yeah, and I don't know if we're going to be alive on the other side of that darkness.\n\n3:29:39.560 --> 3:29:45.160\n I think individually, no, but the way you can live on is by what you do to human consciousness.\n\n3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:49.800\n How do you hope people remember you?\n\n3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:56.880\n As someone who managed to integrate economics with an appreciation for life.\n\n3:29:56.880 --> 3:30:05.440\n Well, I have to say, as a bit of a callback, you're one deadly bastard.\n\n3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:09.360\n It's a huge honor that you would come down and talk to me.\n\n3:30:09.360 --> 3:30:10.440\n You're a brilliant person.\n\n3:30:10.440 --> 3:30:11.840\n You're a hilarious person.\n\n3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:12.960\n The humility shines through.\n\n3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:13.960\n The brilliance shines through.\n\n3:30:13.960 --> 3:30:16.360\n Thank you so much for spending this time.\n\n3:30:16.360 --> 3:30:17.360\n You do the same for humanity.\n\n3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:21.520\n I mean, when I saw that email from you, my eyes popped out of my head.\n\n3:30:21.520 --> 3:30:22.520\n Okay.\n\n3:30:22.520 --> 3:30:23.520\n Well, you should hold your judgment.\n\n3:30:23.520 --> 3:30:25.720\n I got to show you the sex dungeon I have.\n\n3:30:25.720 --> 3:30:28.840\n I'm waiting for an invitation.\n\n3:30:28.840 --> 3:30:30.320\n I'll send my wife over.\n\n3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:31.320\n Awesome.\n\n3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:32.320\n Can't wait.\n\n3:30:32.320 --> 3:30:33.320\n All right.\n\n3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:34.320\n Okay, mate.\n\n3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:36.320\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Steve Keen.\n\n3:30:36.320 --> 3:30:40.340\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:30:40.340 --> 3:30:44.360\n And now let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.\n\n3:30:44.360 --> 3:30:49.880\n To be radical is to grasp things at their root.\n\n3:30:49.880 --> 3:31:07.000\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
