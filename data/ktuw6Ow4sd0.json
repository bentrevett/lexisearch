00:08.720\n and minds in the martial arts world,\n\n00:08.720 --> 00:11.320\n having coached many champions in jiu jitsu,\n\n00:11.320 --> 00:13.520\n submission grappling, and MMA,\n\n00:13.520 --> 00:18.000\n including Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Nick Rodriguez,\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:21.040\n Craig Jones, Nicky Ryan, Chris Weidman,\n\n00:21.040 --> 00:23.320\n and George St. Pierre.\n\n00:23.320 --> 00:25.120\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:25.120 --> 00:28.960\n Onnit, SimpliSafe, Indeed, and Linode.\n\n00:28.960 --> 00:32.320\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:32.320 --> 00:34.520\n As a side note, let me say that John\n\n00:34.520 --> 00:36.780\n is a scholar of not just jiu jitsu,\n\n00:36.780 --> 00:40.700\n but judo, wrestling, Muay Thai, boxing, MMA,\n\n00:40.700 --> 00:45.040\n and outside of that, topics of history, psychology,\n\n00:45.040 --> 00:48.240\n philosophy, and even artificial intelligence,\n\n00:48.240 --> 00:50.660\n as you will hear in this conversation.\n\n00:50.660 --> 00:54.560\n After this chat, I started to entertain the possibility\n\n00:54.560 --> 00:57.200\n of returning back to competition as a black belt,\n\n00:57.200 --> 00:59.280\n maybe even training with John and his team\n\n00:59.280 --> 01:02.240\n for a few weeks leading up to the competition.\n\n01:02.240 --> 01:05.880\n For a recreational practitioner such as myself,\n\n01:05.880 --> 01:08.360\n the value of training and competing in jiu jitsu\n\n01:08.360 --> 01:11.620\n is that it is one of the best ways to get humbled.\n\n01:11.620 --> 01:14.640\n To me, keeping the ego in check is essential\n\n01:14.640 --> 01:17.400\n for a productive and happy life.\n\n01:17.400 --> 01:20.040\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n01:20.040 --> 01:23.580\n and here is my conversation with John Donoher.\n\n01:24.600 --> 01:26.800\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n01:26.800 --> 01:29.200\n Let's start with an easy question.\n\n01:29.200 --> 01:30.040\n There's no warmup?\n\n01:30.040 --> 01:30.860\n That's it?\n\n01:30.860 --> 01:31.700\n No warmup.\n\n01:31.700 --> 01:32.720\n No jumping jacks?\n\n01:34.060 --> 01:37.140\n Let's break that down into two questions.\n\n01:38.160 --> 01:40.660\n I'm a human being, and like any human being,\n\n01:40.660 --> 01:45.440\n I'm biologically programmed to be terrified of death.\n\n01:45.440 --> 01:49.400\n Every physical element in our bodies\n\n01:49.400 --> 01:52.240\n is designed to keep us away from death.\n\n01:52.240 --> 01:54.880\n I'm no different from anyone else in that regard.\n\n01:54.880 --> 01:58.340\n If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building,\n\n01:58.340 --> 02:01.220\n I'm gonna scream all the way down to the concrete.\n\n02:01.220 --> 02:03.760\n If you wave a loaded firearm in my face,\n\n02:03.760 --> 02:05.440\n I'm gonna flinch away in horror\n\n02:05.440 --> 02:07.100\n the same way anyone else would.\n\n02:09.080 --> 02:13.360\n So in that first sense of, are you afraid of death?\n\n02:15.320 --> 02:18.760\n My body is terrified of injury leading to death\n\n02:18.760 --> 02:21.720\n the same way any other human being would.\n\n02:21.720 --> 02:24.400\n So when death is imminent, there's a terror that.\n\n02:24.400 --> 02:26.560\n Yeah, I go through the same adrenaline dumps\n\n02:26.560 --> 02:27.920\n that you would go through.\n\n02:28.920 --> 02:29.960\n But on the other hand,\n\n02:29.960 --> 02:31.680\n you're also asking a much deeper question,\n\n02:31.680 --> 02:35.540\n which is presumably, are you afraid of nonexistence?\n\n02:35.540 --> 02:37.520\n What comes after your physical death?\n\n02:37.520 --> 02:39.520\n And that's the more interesting question.\n\n02:40.520 --> 02:45.520\n No, I should start by saying from the start,\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:48.400\n I'm a materialist.\n\n02:48.400 --> 02:50.200\n I don't believe that we have an immortal soul.\n\n02:50.200 --> 02:53.160\n I don't believe there's a life after our physical death.\n\n02:53.160 --> 02:56.240\n In this sense, from someone who starts\n\n02:56.240 --> 02:57.400\n from that point of view,\n\n02:58.400 --> 03:03.400\n you have to understand that everyone has two deaths.\n\n03:04.800 --> 03:08.040\n We always talk about our death as though there was only one,\n\n03:08.040 --> 03:09.780\n but we all have two deaths.\n\n03:09.780 --> 03:12.820\n There was a time before you were born when you were dead.\n\n03:18.360 --> 03:21.660\n You weren't afraid of that period of nonexistence.\n\n03:21.660 --> 03:24.060\n You don't even think about it.\n\n03:24.060 --> 03:27.220\n So why would you be afraid of your second period\n\n03:27.220 --> 03:28.420\n of nonexistence?\n\n03:28.420 --> 03:30.020\n You came from nonexistence.\n\n03:30.020 --> 03:31.540\n You're gonna go back into it.\n\n03:31.540 --> 03:33.320\n You weren't afraid of the first.\n\n03:33.320 --> 03:35.700\n Why are you somehow afraid of the second?\n\n03:35.700 --> 03:37.900\n So it doesn't really make sense to me\n\n03:37.900 --> 03:40.980\n as to why people would be afraid of nonexistence.\n\n03:40.980 --> 03:43.240\n You dealt with it fine the first time.\n\n03:43.240 --> 03:44.700\n Deal with it the second time.\n\n03:44.700 --> 03:47.700\n But your mind didn't exist for the first death.\n\n03:47.700 --> 03:50.380\n And it won't exist after you die either.\n\n03:50.380 --> 03:53.220\n But it does exist now enough to comprehend\n\n03:53.220 --> 03:56.260\n that there's this thing that you know nothing about\n\n03:56.260 --> 03:58.220\n that's coming, which is nonexistence.\n\n03:58.220 --> 03:59.380\n Actually, you do know about it,\n\n03:59.380 --> 04:01.540\n because you know what it was like before you were born.\n\n04:01.540 --> 04:03.140\n It was just nothing.\n\n04:03.140 --> 04:05.260\n Every time you go to sleep at night,\n\n04:05.260 --> 04:06.860\n you get a sneak preview of death.\n\n04:06.860 --> 04:10.860\n It's just this kind of nothing happens.\n\n04:10.860 --> 04:13.260\n You wake up in the morning, you're alive again.\n\n04:13.260 --> 04:15.520\n But it's not about the sleeping.\n\n04:15.520 --> 04:17.640\n It's about the falling asleep.\n\n04:17.640 --> 04:20.540\n And every night when you fall asleep,\n\n04:20.540 --> 04:22.780\n you assume you're going to wake up.\n\n04:22.780 --> 04:25.740\n Here you know you're not waking up.\n\n04:25.740 --> 04:26.580\n And the knowledge of that.\n\n04:26.580 --> 04:28.180\n But there's a whole step from that\n\n04:28.180 --> 04:29.860\n to the idea of fearing it.\n\n04:29.860 --> 04:32.360\n I'm fully aware that there's gonna be a time\n\n04:32.360 --> 04:33.460\n I don't wake up.\n\n04:33.460 --> 04:34.780\n But are you gonna be afraid of it?\n\n04:34.780 --> 04:36.660\n Is there some mortal terror you have of this?\n\n04:36.660 --> 04:38.040\n No, you didn't have it before.\n\n04:38.040 --> 04:40.100\n You don't have it when you sleep.\n\n04:40.100 --> 04:43.060\n Going from the fact that you know you won't wake up\n\n04:43.060 --> 04:45.040\n to terror is two different things.\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:46.460\n That's an extra step.\n\n04:46.460 --> 04:49.900\n And at that point, you're making a choice at that point.\n\n04:50.820 --> 04:54.020\n What about what some people in this context\n\n04:54.020 --> 04:55.800\n we might call like the third death,\n\n04:55.800 --> 05:00.800\n which is when everybody forgets the entirety\n\n05:01.700 --> 05:03.220\n of consciousness in the universe\n\n05:03.220 --> 05:04.700\n forgets that you've ever existed,\n\n05:04.700 --> 05:07.420\n that John Donahue ever existed.\n\n05:07.420 --> 05:08.260\n So.\n\n05:08.260 --> 05:09.900\n It's almost like a cosmic death.\n\n05:09.900 --> 05:12.100\n It's like everything goes, yeah.\n\n05:12.100 --> 05:15.580\n Not just, I would say it's like knowledge.\n\n05:15.580 --> 05:17.820\n The history books forget about who you are\n\n05:17.820 --> 05:19.020\n because the history books.\n\n05:19.020 --> 05:20.300\n This is inevitable, by the way.\n\n05:20.300 --> 05:23.860\n We're all very, very small players in a very big game.\n\n05:23.860 --> 05:27.680\n And inevitably, we're all going to go at some point.\n\n05:28.780 --> 05:31.620\n Yeah, but doesn't, so you're.\n\n05:31.620 --> 05:33.180\n It's disappointing, of course.\n\n05:33.180 --> 05:38.180\n But it's not even, it would be arrogance to say\n\n05:38.340 --> 05:40.580\n I'm disappointed in the idea that I will disappear.\n\n05:40.580 --> 05:43.160\n But there's far greater things than me that will disappear.\n\n05:43.160 --> 05:46.940\n I mean, it's crushing to think\n\n05:46.940 --> 05:48.500\n that there's going to come a time\n\n05:48.500 --> 05:51.900\n where no one will ever hear Beethoven's symphonies again.\n\n05:51.900 --> 05:54.900\n That the mysteries of the pharaohs will be lost\n\n05:54.900 --> 05:57.960\n and no one will even comprehend that they once existed.\n\n05:57.960 --> 06:01.420\n Humanity has come up with so many amazing things\n\n06:01.420 --> 06:02.680\n over its existence.\n\n06:02.680 --> 06:06.580\n And to think that one day this is just all happening\n\n06:06.580 --> 06:11.280\n on a tiny speck in a distant corner of a very small galaxy\n\n06:11.280 --> 06:13.220\n and among millions of galaxies,\n\n06:13.220 --> 06:15.020\n that this is all for nothing.\n\n06:15.020 --> 06:16.100\n Okay, I can understand.\n\n06:16.100 --> 06:18.300\n There's a kind of dread that comes with this.\n\n06:20.060 --> 06:22.780\n But there's also a sense in which the moment you're born\n\n06:22.780 --> 06:24.500\n and the moment you can think about these things,\n\n06:24.500 --> 06:26.820\n you know this is your inevitable fate.\n\n06:26.820 --> 06:28.020\n Is it so inevitable?\n\n06:28.020 --> 06:30.260\n So if we look at, we're in Austin\n\n06:30.260 --> 06:32.460\n and there's a guy named Elon Musk.\n\n06:32.460 --> 06:35.160\n And he's hoping, in fact, that is the drive\n\n06:35.160 --> 06:36.820\n behind many of his passions,\n\n06:36.820 --> 06:40.740\n is the human beings becoming a multi planetary species\n\n06:40.740 --> 06:44.180\n and expanding out, exploring and colonizing\n\n06:44.180 --> 06:46.660\n the solar system, the galaxy,\n\n06:46.660 --> 06:48.880\n and maybe the rest of the universe.\n\n06:48.880 --> 06:52.180\n Is that something that fills you with excitement?\n\n06:52.180 --> 06:54.200\n As a project, it's very exciting.\n\n06:56.060 --> 06:59.780\n The whole, I mean, we all grew up with science fiction,\n\n06:59.780 --> 07:02.640\n the idea of exploration.\n\n07:02.640 --> 07:06.500\n The same way human beings in earlier centuries\n\n07:06.500 --> 07:08.740\n were thrilled at the idea of discovering a new world,\n\n07:08.740 --> 07:10.900\n you know, America or some other part of the world\n\n07:10.900 --> 07:13.580\n that they sail to and come back.\n\n07:13.580 --> 07:15.260\n But now instead of sailing oceans,\n\n07:15.260 --> 07:20.260\n you're sailing solar systems and ultimately even further.\n\n07:20.460 --> 07:21.900\n So of course that's exciting.\n\n07:21.900 --> 07:25.060\n But as far as relieving us from non existence,\n\n07:25.060 --> 07:26.940\n it's just playing a delaying game\n\n07:26.940 --> 07:30.060\n because ultimately, even the universe itself,\n\n07:30.060 --> 07:31.940\n if the laws of thermodynamics are correct,\n\n07:31.940 --> 07:33.320\n will ultimately die.\n\n07:33.320 --> 07:38.320\n Of course, we might not understand most of the physics\n\n07:40.400 --> 07:42.600\n and how the universe functions.\n\n07:42.600 --> 07:44.120\n You said laws of thermodynamics,\n\n07:44.120 --> 07:47.000\n but maybe that's just a tiny little fraction\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.080\n of what the universe actually is.\n\n07:49.080 --> 07:50.360\n Maybe there's multiple dimensions,\n\n07:50.360 --> 07:52.940\n maybe there's multiple universes,\n\n07:52.940 --> 07:55.520\n maybe the entirety of this experience.\n\n07:55.520 --> 07:57.400\n You know, there's guys like Donald Hoffman\n\n07:57.400 --> 07:59.400\n that think that all of this is just an illusion\n\n07:59.400 --> 08:03.720\n that we don't, like human cognition and perception\n\n08:03.720 --> 08:05.600\n constructs a whole, it's like a video game\n\n08:05.600 --> 08:07.080\n that we construct that's very distant\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:08.600\n from the actual reality.\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:10.680\n And maybe one day we'll understand that reality,\n\n08:10.680 --> 08:12.760\n maybe it'll be like the matrix kind of thing.\n\n08:12.760 --> 08:15.120\n So there's a lot of different possibilities here.\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:18.880\n And there's also a philosopher named Ernest Becker.\n\n08:18.880 --> 08:20.240\n I don't know if you know who that is.\n\n08:20.240 --> 08:22.560\n He wrote Denial of Death.\n\n08:22.560 --> 08:25.980\n And his idea, he disagrees with you, but he's dead now,\n\n08:25.980 --> 08:30.980\n is that he thinks that the terror of death,\n\n08:31.900 --> 08:35.380\n the terror of the knowledge that we're going to die\n\n08:35.380 --> 08:38.020\n is within all of us and is in fact the driver\n\n08:38.020 --> 08:41.460\n behind most of the creativity that we do.\n\n08:41.460 --> 08:43.580\n Exploring out into the universe,\n\n08:43.580 --> 08:47.820\n but also you becoming one of the great scholars\n\n08:47.820 --> 08:52.540\n of the martial arts, the philosophers of fighting\n\n08:52.540 --> 08:55.460\n is because you're actually terrified of death\n\n08:55.460 --> 09:00.460\n and you want to somehow permeate your knowledge,\n\n09:00.940 --> 09:05.500\n your ideas, your essence to permeate human civilization\n\n09:05.500 --> 09:09.600\n so that even when your body dies, you live on.\n\n09:10.780 --> 09:14.140\n I would agree with him insofar as death\n\n09:14.140 --> 09:18.060\n is the single greatest motivator for action.\n\n09:18.060 --> 09:22.100\n But going beyond that and saying it's somehow terrifying,\n\n09:22.100 --> 09:24.180\n that's an extra step on his part.\n\n09:24.180 --> 09:27.540\n And not everyone's going to follow him on that step.\n\n09:27.540 --> 09:32.540\n I do believe that death is the single most important element\n\n09:34.060 --> 09:37.280\n in life that gives value to our days.\n\n09:37.280 --> 09:40.900\n If you think, for example, of a situation\n\n09:40.900 --> 09:44.340\n where a God came to you and gave you immortality,\n\n09:46.380 --> 09:49.360\n life would be very, very different for you.\n\n09:49.360 --> 09:54.360\n You're a talented research scientist, you work to a schedule.\n\n09:55.900 --> 09:56.740\n Why?\n\n09:56.740 --> 09:59.260\n Because ultimately you know your life is finite\n\n09:59.260 --> 10:01.140\n and actually very finite.\n\n10:02.560 --> 10:05.800\n And could be even more so if fate plays its hand\n\n10:05.800 --> 10:08.960\n and you die an early death or what have you.\n\n10:08.960 --> 10:11.100\n We never know what's going to happen tomorrow.\n\n10:13.160 --> 10:18.160\n As such, we get work done as soon as we can.\n\n10:18.160 --> 10:21.320\n The moment you gain immortality,\n\n10:21.320 --> 10:23.920\n you can always put every project off.\n\n10:23.920 --> 10:25.920\n You can always say, I don't need to do this today\n\n10:25.920 --> 10:30.080\n because I can do it four centuries from now.\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:33.320\n And as you extend artificially a human life,\n\n10:33.320 --> 10:36.080\n the motivation to get things done here and now\n\n10:36.080 --> 10:40.300\n and work industriously and excel fades away\n\n10:40.300 --> 10:42.700\n because you can always come back to the idea\n\n10:42.700 --> 10:45.080\n that you can do this in the future.\n\n10:45.080 --> 10:49.920\n And so what gives value to our days is ultimately death.\n\n10:49.920 --> 10:54.920\n And value, it's not the only reason behind value,\n\n10:55.440 --> 10:59.480\n but a huge part of what we consider value is scarcity.\n\n10:59.480 --> 11:02.080\n And death gives us scarcity of days\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:04.620\n and is probably the single greatest motivator\n\n11:04.620 --> 11:08.200\n for almost every action we partake in.\n\n11:08.200 --> 11:10.240\n It's kind of tragic and beautiful\n\n11:10.240 --> 11:15.240\n that what makes things amazing is that they end.\n\n11:19.060 --> 11:22.480\n Yeah, I think it would actually be a terrible burden\n\n11:22.480 --> 11:23.640\n to be immortal.\n\n11:27.220 --> 11:29.820\n Life would be in many ways very hollow and meaningless,\n\n11:29.820 --> 11:30.860\n I think.\n\n11:30.860 --> 11:34.140\n People talk about death taking away the meaning of life,\n\n11:34.140 --> 11:37.440\n but I think immortality would have a very similar effect\n\n11:37.440 --> 11:42.160\n in a different direction.\n\n11:42.160 --> 11:47.160\n So given this short life, we can think about jujitsu,\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:51.360\n we can think about any kind of pursuit.\n\n11:51.360 --> 11:53.320\n What do you think makes a great life?\n\n11:54.400 --> 11:59.180\n Is it the highest peak of achievement?\n\n12:00.240 --> 12:03.160\n You know, you think about like an Olympic gold medal,\n\n12:03.160 --> 12:05.200\n the highest level of performance,\n\n12:05.200 --> 12:08.560\n or is it the longevity of performance,\n\n12:08.560 --> 12:12.220\n of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time?\n\n12:12.220 --> 12:15.380\n I think the latter is kind of what we talk about\n\n12:15.380 --> 12:18.200\n in at least American society.\n\n12:18.200 --> 12:22.620\n You know, we want people to be healthy, balanced,\n\n12:22.620 --> 12:25.360\n perform well for a long time.\n\n12:25.360 --> 12:30.360\n And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic,\n\n12:30.440 --> 12:33.800\n which is the highest peak is what defines.\n\n12:33.800 --> 12:35.440\n You asked an initial question,\n\n12:35.440 --> 12:37.600\n which what makes a great life,\n\n12:37.600 --> 12:40.600\n but then pointed towards two options,\n\n12:40.600 --> 12:43.680\n one of longevity versus degree of difficulty.\n\n12:43.680 --> 12:45.840\n There's gotta be a lot more than that, surely.\n\n12:47.840 --> 12:50.960\n I mean, think about, first of all,\n\n12:50.960 --> 12:52.360\n we have to understand from the start\n\n12:52.360 --> 12:55.080\n that there's never gonna be an agreed upon set of criteria\n\n12:55.080 --> 12:58.680\n for this is a great life from all perspective.\n\n12:58.680 --> 13:01.720\n If you look from the perspective of, say, Machiavelli,\n\n13:01.720 --> 13:03.900\n then Stalin lived a great life.\n\n13:04.800 --> 13:07.000\n He was highly successful at what he did.\n\n13:07.000 --> 13:08.400\n He started from nothing.\n\n13:08.400 --> 13:10.480\n So the degree of difficulty in what he did\n\n13:10.480 --> 13:12.400\n was extraordinarily high.\n\n13:12.400 --> 13:15.800\n He had massive impact upon world history.\n\n13:15.800 --> 13:20.240\n He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies.\n\n13:20.240 --> 13:23.640\n He lived to old age and died of natural causes.\n\n13:23.640 --> 13:26.920\n So from Machiavelli's point of view, he had a great life.\n\n13:26.920 --> 13:30.000\n If you ask the Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s\n\n13:30.000 --> 13:31.080\n whether he lived a great life,\n\n13:31.080 --> 13:32.680\n you get a very different answer.\n\n13:33.600 --> 13:34.600\n So everything's gonna come\n\n13:34.600 --> 13:37.760\n from what perspective you begin with this.\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:39.080\n You're going to look out at the world\n\n13:39.080 --> 13:40.080\n with a given point of view,\n\n13:40.080 --> 13:41.240\n and you're gonna make your judgments.\n\n13:41.240 --> 13:43.940\n Was this a great life or was this a terrible life?\n\n13:45.960 --> 13:48.460\n Going back to your point, you were actually,\n\n13:48.460 --> 13:51.880\n I think, focusing the question on more\n\n13:51.880 --> 13:55.640\n in terms of great single performances\n\n13:55.640 --> 13:57.400\n versus longevity of performances.\n\n13:58.520 --> 14:00.420\n Presumably, this isn't really a question\n\n14:00.420 --> 14:03.400\n about what makes a great life, then,\n\n14:03.400 --> 14:06.920\n because there's so much more than that to a great life.\n\n14:06.920 --> 14:07.760\n I don't know.\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:08.840\n I'm gonna push back on that.\n\n14:08.840 --> 14:11.440\n So I think the parallels are very much closer\n\n14:11.440 --> 14:13.080\n than you're making them seem.\n\n14:13.080 --> 14:14.920\n I think, let's compare Stalin.\n\n14:14.920 --> 14:18.420\n Stalin is an example of somebody who held power,\n\n14:18.420 --> 14:22.080\n considered by many to be one of the most powerful men ever.\n\n14:22.080 --> 14:24.120\n He held power for 30 years.\n\n14:24.120 --> 14:26.080\n So that's what I'm referring to, longevity.\n\n14:26.080 --> 14:27.880\n And then there's a few people,\n\n14:27.880 --> 14:31.120\n I wish my knowledge of history was better,\n\n14:31.120 --> 14:34.860\n but people who fought a few great battles,\n\n14:34.860 --> 14:37.840\n and they did not maintain power, but they were.\n\n14:37.840 --> 14:40.680\n Let's contrast, say, for example, Alexander the Great,\n\n14:40.680 --> 14:45.640\n who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes,\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:53.440\n had around four to five truly defining battles in his life,\n\n14:53.440 --> 14:58.440\n which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements,\n\n15:00.400 --> 15:04.520\n and burned very bright, but didn't burn long.\n\n15:04.520 --> 15:07.360\n Stalin, on the other hand, started from nothing,\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:09.560\n and quietly, methodically worked his way\n\n15:09.560 --> 15:10.940\n through the revolutionary phase,\n\n15:10.940 --> 15:14.400\n and gained increasing amounts of power,\n\n15:14.400 --> 15:19.400\n and as he said, went all the way to the end of his career.\n\n15:21.340 --> 15:23.120\n Yeah, there's definitely something to be said\n\n15:23.120 --> 15:28.120\n for longevity, but as to which one is greater than the other,\n\n15:29.880 --> 15:34.880\n you can't give a definition, or a set of criteria,\n\n15:36.520 --> 15:39.560\n which will definitively say this is better than that.\n\n15:39.560 --> 15:40.400\n But when you look...\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:42.000\n Ultimately, we look at Alexander as great,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.320\n but in a different way, and we look at Stalin.\n\n15:44.320 --> 15:45.200\n I didn't think many people would say\n\n15:45.200 --> 15:46.220\n Stalin was a great person,\n\n15:46.220 --> 15:49.040\n but from the Machiavellian point of view,\n\n15:49.040 --> 15:53.360\n you would say he was great also.\n\n15:53.360 --> 15:56.360\n But when you think about beautiful creations\n\n15:56.360 --> 15:59.880\n done by human beings in the space of, say,\n\n15:59.880 --> 16:02.120\n martial arts, in the space of sport,\n\n16:03.220 --> 16:06.900\n what inspires you, the peak of performance?\n\n16:06.900 --> 16:08.480\n I see where you're coming from.\n\n16:08.480 --> 16:10.160\n It's a great question.\n\n16:10.160 --> 16:13.960\n For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty,\n\n16:13.960 --> 16:17.320\n but things are difficult in different ways, okay?\n\n16:17.320 --> 16:22.320\n A single, flawless performance in youth\n\n16:22.700 --> 16:25.280\n is still that wins a gold medal.\n\n16:25.280 --> 16:28.320\n Let's say, for example, Nadia Comaneci\n\n16:28.320 --> 16:31.240\n won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics,\n\n16:31.240 --> 16:34.160\n the first person ever to get a perfect score.\n\n16:34.160 --> 16:36.440\n If she had disappeared after that,\n\n16:36.440 --> 16:39.120\n we would still remember that as an incredible moment.\n\n16:39.120 --> 16:42.320\n And the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score\n\n16:42.320 --> 16:46.000\n in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts.\n\n16:46.000 --> 16:50.240\n And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics\n\n16:50.240 --> 16:52.040\n and got four silver medals.\n\n16:52.040 --> 16:53.920\n I mean, they're both incredible achievements.\n\n16:53.920 --> 16:55.040\n They're just different.\n\n16:56.000 --> 16:58.380\n The attributes that lead to longevity\n\n16:59.380 --> 17:01.780\n typically tend to conflict with the attributes\n\n17:01.780 --> 17:05.240\n that bring a powerful, single performance.\n\n17:05.240 --> 17:08.560\n One is all about focus on a particular event.\n\n17:08.560 --> 17:13.560\n The other is on spreading your resources over time.\n\n17:13.560 --> 17:16.100\n Both present tremendous difficulties.\n\n17:17.140 --> 17:19.460\n There's no need to say one is better than the other.\n\n17:19.460 --> 17:21.700\n There's also just, for me personally,\n\n17:21.700 --> 17:26.700\n the stories of somebody who truly struggled\n\n17:26.700 --> 17:29.100\n are the most powerful.\n\n17:29.100 --> 17:31.420\n I know a bunch of people don't necessarily agree,\n\n17:31.420 --> 17:33.620\n because you said perfection.\n\n17:33.620 --> 17:37.140\n Perfection is kind of the antithesis of struggle.\n\n17:37.140 --> 17:39.500\n But I look at somebody, okay, my own life,\n\n17:39.500 --> 17:41.700\n somebody I'm a fan, oh, I'm a fan of everybody.\n\n17:41.700 --> 17:42.840\n I'm a huge fan of yours.\n\n17:42.840 --> 17:44.020\n I'm trying not to be nervous here.\n\n17:44.020 --> 17:47.100\n But somebody I'm a fan of in the judo world\n\n17:47.100 --> 17:49.060\n is Travis Stevens.\n\n17:49.060 --> 17:50.980\n He's a remarkable fellow, by the way.\n\n17:50.980 --> 17:52.500\n A remarkable human being.\n\n17:52.500 --> 17:54.860\n Insane in the best kinds of ways.\n\n17:54.860 --> 17:59.000\n I think I started judo, I really started martial arts.\n\n17:59.000 --> 18:00.940\n I wrestled, if you consider those martial arts.\n\n18:00.940 --> 18:03.500\n That's been in my blood.\n\n18:03.500 --> 18:04.780\n I'm Russian, so.\n\n18:04.780 --> 18:08.800\n But beyond that, the whole pajama thing we wear, the gi,\n\n18:08.800 --> 18:12.700\n I started by watching Travis in 2008 Olympics.\n\n18:12.700 --> 18:15.300\n Was that accidental, or did you know Travis\n\n18:15.300 --> 18:16.140\n prior to watching him?\n\n18:16.140 --> 18:17.700\n No, no, no, I just tuned in.\n\n18:17.700 --> 18:19.380\n Now, that's an unusual choice.\n\n18:19.380 --> 18:20.900\n It was just random, you just tuned in\n\n18:20.900 --> 18:22.300\n and you saw Travis Stevens.\n\n18:22.300 --> 18:23.820\n I tuned in to the Olympics,\n\n18:23.820 --> 18:26.160\n and I was wondering what judo is.\n\n18:26.160 --> 18:29.060\n And then I started watching.\n\n18:30.100 --> 18:32.740\n We're all proud of our countries and so on,\n\n18:32.740 --> 18:33.740\n so I started watching.\n\n18:33.740 --> 18:36.740\n He was, I think, the only American\n\n18:36.740 --> 18:39.920\n in the Olympics for judo.\n\n18:39.920 --> 18:44.020\n Maybe the, so this Kayla Harrison was 2012.\n\n18:44.020 --> 18:47.340\n Rhonda was there too, so I watched Rhonda and Travis.\n\n18:47.340 --> 18:51.500\n But obviously, sort of, I was focused on somebody\n\n18:51.500 --> 18:53.060\n who also weighed the same as I did,\n\n18:53.060 --> 18:57.540\n so there was a kinda, I think, 81 kilograms.\n\n18:57.540 --> 19:00.300\n So there's a connection, but also there's an intensity\n\n19:00.300 --> 19:05.300\n to him, like, he would get angry at his own failures\n\n19:06.100 --> 19:07.820\n and he would just refuse to quit.\n\n19:07.820 --> 19:10.580\n It's that kinda Dan Gable mentality.\n\n19:10.580 --> 19:14.100\n I just, that was inspiring to me, that he's the underdog.\n\n19:14.100 --> 19:17.620\n And the way people talk about him, the commentators,\n\n19:17.620 --> 19:21.380\n that it was an unlikely person to do well, right?\n\n19:21.380 --> 19:25.380\n And I, the FU attitude behind that,\n\n19:25.380 --> 19:27.260\n saying, no, I'm gonna still win gold.\n\n19:27.260 --> 19:29.260\n Obviously, he didn't do well in 2008,\n\n19:29.260 --> 19:33.380\n but that was somehow inspiring.\n\n19:33.380 --> 19:36.460\n And I just remember he pulled me in,\n\n19:36.460 --> 19:39.500\n but then I started to see this sport,\n\n19:39.500 --> 19:40.820\n I guess you can call it,\n\n19:42.100 --> 19:47.100\n of effortlessly dominating your opponent in throwing.\n\n19:48.580 --> 19:52.220\n Because to me, wrestling was like a grind.\n\n19:52.220 --> 19:56.900\n You kind of control, you slowly just break your opponent.\n\n19:56.900 --> 20:01.380\n The idea that you could, with like a foot sweep,\n\n20:01.380 --> 20:06.100\n was fascinating to me, that just because of timing,\n\n20:06.100 --> 20:10.500\n you can take these like monsters, giant people,\n\n20:10.500 --> 20:14.660\n like incredible athletes, and just smash them.\n\n20:14.660 --> 20:18.180\n With, it just doesn't, there was no struggle to it.\n\n20:18.180 --> 20:19.980\n It was always like a look of surprise.\n\n20:19.980 --> 20:23.580\n Judo, dominance in Judo has a look,\n\n20:23.580 --> 20:27.060\n like the other person is like, what just happened?\n\n20:27.060 --> 20:28.580\n This is very different from wrestling.\n\n20:28.580 --> 20:30.700\n It's built into the rule structure too,\n\n20:30.700 --> 20:32.060\n the whole idea of an epon,\n\n20:32.060 --> 20:34.300\n of a match being over in an instant.\n\n20:34.300 --> 20:39.020\n And that creates a thrilling spectator sport,\n\n20:39.020 --> 20:42.020\n because you can, as you say, with Ashiwaza,\n\n20:42.020 --> 20:45.980\n the foot sweeps, you can take someone out\n\n20:45.980 --> 20:49.780\n who's heavily favored, and if you're not,\n\n20:49.780 --> 20:53.460\n Judo is the most unforgiving of all the grappling sports.\n\n20:53.460 --> 20:56.380\n If you have a lapse of concentration for half a second,\n\n20:56.380 --> 20:59.220\n it's done, it's over.\n\n20:59.220 --> 21:01.180\n If those guys get a grip on each other,\n\n21:01.180 --> 21:05.340\n any one of them can throw the other.\n\n21:05.340 --> 21:10.340\n The idea, when you see someone like Nomura,\n\n21:11.060 --> 21:14.220\n who won three Olympic gold medals,\n\n21:14.220 --> 21:17.500\n to win across three Olympics,\n\n21:17.500 --> 21:19.460\n and that's an incredible achievement,\n\n21:19.460 --> 21:21.500\n given how many ways there are to lose\n\n21:21.500 --> 21:22.900\n in the standing position in Judo,\n\n21:22.900 --> 21:25.660\n and how unforgiving it is as a sport,\n\n21:25.660 --> 21:28.660\n it shows an incredible level of dominance.\n\n21:28.660 --> 21:32.700\n And I think when I was also introduced at that time\n\n21:33.900 --> 21:36.380\n to the idea, just like in Judo,\n\n21:36.380 --> 21:38.140\n I think in Jiu Jitsu is the same,\n\n21:38.980 --> 21:40.620\n a lot of sports is probably the same,\n\n21:40.620 --> 21:44.100\n is there's ways to win that include kind of,\n\n21:45.140 --> 21:48.100\n if I were to use a bad term, stalling,\n\n21:48.100 --> 21:51.260\n which is like use strategy to slow down,\n\n21:51.260 --> 21:53.580\n to destroy all the weapons your opponent has,\n\n21:53.580 --> 21:55.220\n and just to wait it out,\n\n21:55.220 --> 21:58.380\n to sort of break your opponent by,\n\n21:58.380 --> 22:00.140\n yeah, shutting down all their weapons,\n\n22:00.140 --> 22:02.380\n but not using any of your own.\n\n22:02.380 --> 22:06.460\n And now, Travis was always going for,\n\n22:06.460 --> 22:08.940\n he's of course really good at gripping\n\n22:08.940 --> 22:10.260\n and couldn't do that whole game,\n\n22:10.260 --> 22:12.860\n but he was going for the big throws.\n\n22:12.860 --> 22:15.500\n And he was almost getting frustrated\n\n22:15.500 --> 22:17.660\n by a lot of the opponents.\n\n22:17.660 --> 22:21.660\n I remember Ola Bischoff, I think.\n\n22:21.660 --> 22:23.580\n Yes, from Germany.\n\n22:23.580 --> 22:24.420\n From Germany.\n\n22:24.420 --> 22:25.300\n Very talented.\n\n22:25.300 --> 22:26.300\n Very incredible.\n\n22:26.300 --> 22:28.580\n I know he's very good at doing big throws\n\n22:28.580 --> 22:29.820\n and he's an incredible judoka,\n\n22:29.820 --> 22:31.980\n but he was also incredible\n\n22:31.980 --> 22:33.740\n at just frustrating his opponents\n\n22:33.740 --> 22:36.100\n with gripping and strategy and so on.\n\n22:36.100 --> 22:39.660\n And I just remember feeling the pain of this person,\n\n22:39.660 --> 22:42.460\n like Travis, who went through just,\n\n22:42.460 --> 22:44.420\n he broke like every part of his body.\n\n22:44.420 --> 22:46.500\n He went through so many injuries.\n\n22:46.500 --> 22:50.060\n Just this person who dedicated his entire life\n\n22:50.060 --> 22:55.060\n to this moment in 2008 and then 2012 and 2016,\n\n22:55.060 --> 22:57.020\n just gave everything.\n\n22:57.020 --> 22:58.420\n You could see it on his face\n\n22:59.620 --> 23:04.380\n that his weapons are being shut down\n\n23:04.380 --> 23:05.940\n and he's still pushing forward.\n\n23:05.940 --> 23:09.420\n He's still with that, both the frustration and the power.\n\n23:09.420 --> 23:14.140\n I mean, the kind of throw he does is his main one,\n\n23:14.140 --> 23:16.740\n I think, is the standing, it was called Seoi Nage.\n\n23:16.740 --> 23:17.580\n Ippon Seoi Nage.\n\n23:17.580 --> 23:18.420\n Ippon Seoi Nage.\n\n23:18.420 --> 23:21.220\n But that was the other thing is like,\n\n23:21.220 --> 23:25.220\n the techniques he used was these big throws\n\n23:25.220 --> 23:27.860\n that there's something to me about the Seoi Nage.\n\n23:27.860 --> 23:29.980\n I fell in love with that throw.\n\n23:29.980 --> 23:34.300\n That's my main throw, standing Seoi Nage.\n\n23:34.300 --> 23:35.260\n That is like...\n\n23:35.260 --> 23:37.100\n Why do you favor the standing variation?\n\n23:37.100 --> 23:38.300\n Because of the amplitude?\n\n23:39.540 --> 23:41.780\n You get a more powerful wind up.\n\n23:41.780 --> 23:43.220\n Yeah, power.\n\n23:43.220 --> 23:44.060\n It's like...\n\n23:44.060 --> 23:45.220\n Are you a fan of Koga?\n\n23:45.220 --> 23:46.060\n Yes.\n\n23:46.060 --> 23:48.500\n That's when I, Travis,\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:51.340\n so Koga and Travis opened up my...\n\n23:52.740 --> 23:54.460\n Travis uses the same gripping patterns\n\n23:54.460 --> 23:55.700\n for Seoi Nage as Koga.\n\n23:55.700 --> 23:59.460\n All the same, and the way he uses his hips and turns.\n\n23:59.460 --> 24:01.780\n And I remember going to my judo club\n\n24:01.780 --> 24:05.020\n and other judo clubs and they were all saying,\n\n24:05.020 --> 24:07.020\n this is the wrong way to do it.\n\n24:07.020 --> 24:08.780\n The way Travis does it is the wrong way to do it.\n\n24:08.780 --> 24:09.620\n And I remember...\n\n24:09.620 --> 24:11.060\n I've always been amazed by this, by the way.\n\n24:11.060 --> 24:12.340\n I don't mean to cut you off,\n\n24:12.340 --> 24:17.340\n but I could literally fill 20 hours\n\n24:17.340 --> 24:22.340\n of reproductions of people who will tell me\n\n24:22.820 --> 24:26.860\n that either my students or other great world champions\n\n24:28.220 --> 24:29.780\n are doing things wrong.\n\n24:30.700 --> 24:35.140\n And I'm looking at them and I'm like,\n\n24:35.140 --> 24:38.260\n who would I rather trust here in their judgment?\n\n24:39.380 --> 24:44.300\n Koga, who was one of the greatest throwers of all time,\n\n24:44.300 --> 24:49.300\n or you, a recreational guy who couldn't throw my grandmother.\n\n24:54.060 --> 24:56.740\n I'm supposed to take your word over his.\n\n24:56.740 --> 25:00.620\n Well, say, don't listen to what people say.\n\n25:00.620 --> 25:02.500\n I'm gonna give you a piece of advice here.\n\n25:02.500 --> 25:06.020\n Watch what the best people do, okay?\n\n25:06.020 --> 25:09.220\n That's how you get superior athletic performance.\n\n25:09.220 --> 25:11.180\n I'm gonna say that again.\n\n25:11.180 --> 25:13.060\n Don't listen to what people say.\n\n25:13.060 --> 25:14.860\n Watch what they do,\n\n25:14.860 --> 25:17.420\n particularly under the stress of high level competition,\n\n25:17.420 --> 25:19.580\n because that's when you see their real game,\n\n25:19.580 --> 25:22.540\n what they really do under pressure, okay?\n\n25:22.540 --> 25:24.220\n And if you can emulate that,\n\n25:24.220 --> 25:26.020\n you're gonna be very successful.\n\n25:26.020 --> 25:29.740\n I guess what I was frustrated with, to your point,\n\n25:29.740 --> 25:32.740\n is that the argument against Koga\n\n25:32.740 --> 25:37.020\n is he has a very specific body type\n\n25:37.020 --> 25:39.540\n and he figured out something that worked for him.\n\n25:39.540 --> 25:44.540\n The statement is that might not be applicable to you\n\n25:46.340 --> 25:49.460\n or to the general public of judo players\n\n25:49.460 --> 25:51.220\n that wanna succeed.\n\n25:51.220 --> 25:56.220\n That, by the way, at the shallow level, might be true.\n\n25:57.260 --> 26:00.260\n The point is there might be a body of knowledge\n\n26:00.260 --> 26:05.260\n that's yet to be discovered and explored that Koga opened up\n\n26:05.260 --> 26:09.980\n that I wanted to understand why his technique worked.\n\n26:09.980 --> 26:12.420\n It made no sense to me that with a single foot,\n\n26:12.420 --> 26:14.180\n like the way you turn the hip,\n\n26:14.180 --> 26:17.500\n the single foot that steps in, why does that work?\n\n26:17.500 --> 26:20.500\n Because it was actually very difficult to make work\n\n26:20.500 --> 26:23.180\n for me as a white belt in the very beginning.\n\n26:23.180 --> 26:24.500\n It doesn't make sense.\n\n26:24.500 --> 26:28.060\n Like people just, they don't get loaded up onto your hip.\n\n26:28.060 --> 26:30.740\n Anyway, for people who don't watch Koga highlights,\n\n26:30.740 --> 26:32.660\n watch Travis Stevens highlights,\n\n26:32.660 --> 26:36.740\n but the details of the technique don't make sense,\n\n26:36.740 --> 26:40.180\n but when mastered, it feels like\n\n26:40.180 --> 26:42.220\n there's something fundamental there\n\n26:42.220 --> 26:43.940\n that hasn't been explored yet.\n\n26:43.940 --> 26:48.340\n It's like Koga and Travis made me think\n\n26:48.340 --> 26:53.340\n that we don't know most of the body mechanics involved\n\n26:53.940 --> 26:55.660\n in dominance in judo.\n\n26:55.660 --> 26:57.900\n Like we just kind of found a few pockets\n\n26:57.900 --> 26:58.860\n that work really well.\n\n26:58.860 --> 27:02.820\n There's Yamada, there's these different throws, Osorogari.\n\n27:02.820 --> 27:05.180\n I wonder if there's like totally cool new things\n\n27:05.180 --> 27:06.180\n that we haven't discovered.\n\n27:06.180 --> 27:07.980\n And that Seinagi gave a little peak\n\n27:07.980 --> 27:10.980\n because there's very few people that I'm aware of\n\n27:10.980 --> 27:13.860\n that do it the way Travis and Koga did.\n\n27:13.860 --> 27:15.340\n May I ask you a question?\n\n27:15.340 --> 27:16.180\n Yes.\n\n27:17.220 --> 27:20.540\n The choice of standing Seinagi,\n\n27:20.540 --> 27:23.620\n I should say this for your listeners.\n\n27:23.620 --> 27:24.460\n They're probably thinking,\n\n27:24.460 --> 27:26.860\n what the hell are these two guys talking about?\n\n27:26.860 --> 27:30.180\n Seinagi is one of the more high percentage throws\n\n27:30.180 --> 27:31.620\n in the Olympic sport of judo.\n\n27:32.660 --> 27:36.300\n Probably Uchimata is probably number one\n\n27:36.300 --> 27:39.140\n and variations of Seinagi would be\n\n27:39.140 --> 27:40.620\n in the top five for sure.\n\n27:41.740 --> 27:44.700\n The basic choice you have in modern competition\n\n27:44.700 --> 27:47.900\n is the more difficult standing Seinagi\n\n27:47.900 --> 27:49.980\n where you literally are up on your feet\n\n27:49.980 --> 27:52.340\n and you perform a shoulder throw\n\n27:52.340 --> 27:55.740\n that takes your opponent over from a full standing position.\n\n27:55.740 --> 27:59.260\n The most popular form of Seinagi\n\n27:59.260 --> 28:01.100\n in modern competition by a landslide\n\n28:01.100 --> 28:02.460\n is not the standing version.\n\n28:02.460 --> 28:05.540\n It's a drop Seinagi where you go down to your knees.\n\n28:05.540 --> 28:08.500\n This means you have a much easier time\n\n28:08.500 --> 28:10.500\n getting underneath your opponent's center of gravity.\n\n28:10.500 --> 28:12.500\n The defining feature of any Seinagi\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:14.820\n is getting underneath your opponent's center of gravity\n\n28:14.820 --> 28:15.660\n and lifting them.\n\n28:15.660 --> 28:18.500\n Seoi literally means to lift and carry.\n\n28:21.340 --> 28:23.580\n Why did you choose the more difficult version?\n\n28:23.580 --> 28:24.740\n What was your motivation?\n\n28:24.740 --> 28:26.900\n You know, you're a smart kid.\n\n28:26.900 --> 28:28.700\n You know right from the start\n\n28:28.700 --> 28:30.340\n that for every standing Seinagi,\n\n28:30.340 --> 28:32.660\n there's 20 drop Seinagis in modern competition.\n\n28:32.660 --> 28:34.860\n One is obviously more high percentage.\n\n28:34.860 --> 28:39.380\n One obviously works for a wider variety of body types.\n\n28:39.380 --> 28:41.300\n The number of people who are successful\n\n28:41.300 --> 28:43.860\n with standing Seinagi is dramatically lower.\n\n28:44.700 --> 28:47.660\n And it appears to be a move which is completely absent\n\n28:47.660 --> 28:49.980\n in the heavyweight divisions\n\n28:49.980 --> 28:53.340\n and rarely seen in the lightweight divisions.\n\n28:53.340 --> 28:55.180\n Why?\n\n28:55.180 --> 28:56.900\n What was the motivation?\n\n28:56.900 --> 29:00.100\n Why did you willingly adopt the less high percentage\n\n29:00.100 --> 29:01.820\n over the more high percentage?\n\n29:01.820 --> 29:04.860\n And this would be very interesting.\n\n29:04.860 --> 29:06.460\n I would love you to break it apart\n\n29:06.460 --> 29:09.300\n because I apply the same kind of thinking\n\n29:09.300 --> 29:10.380\n to basically everything.\n\n29:10.380 --> 29:11.460\n I mentioned to you offline,\n\n29:11.460 --> 29:14.940\n there's these Boston Dynamics Spot Robots.\n\n29:14.940 --> 29:17.260\n When I first met Spot, I fell in love.\n\n29:18.140 --> 29:20.620\n I don't understand what exactly,\n\n29:20.620 --> 29:22.700\n but there's magic there.\n\n29:22.700 --> 29:24.580\n And I just got excited by it.\n\n29:24.580 --> 29:26.460\n And that fire burns.\n\n29:26.460 --> 29:27.700\n I wanna work with these robots.\n\n29:27.700 --> 29:29.660\n I wanna work with the robots.\n\n29:29.660 --> 29:33.620\n I want to, I felt like there's something special there\n\n29:33.620 --> 29:36.500\n that I could build something interesting with,\n\n29:36.500 --> 29:38.100\n create something interesting with.\n\n29:38.100 --> 29:41.300\n And the same with the standing Seinagi\n\n29:41.300 --> 29:43.100\n from Koga and Travis.\n\n29:43.100 --> 29:44.820\n I just fell in love with that technique.\n\n29:44.820 --> 29:45.660\n Just even watching,\n\n29:45.660 --> 29:47.820\n I didn't even know what the hell to do with it.\n\n29:47.820 --> 29:49.580\n Was it aesthetic?\n\n29:49.580 --> 29:51.940\n The standing Seinagi is more beautiful in execution.\n\n29:51.940 --> 29:52.780\n There's no question.\n\n29:52.780 --> 29:57.780\n In my own, we're talking about love here, right?\n\n29:58.060 --> 30:01.300\n In my own definition of aesthetic, yes.\n\n30:01.300 --> 30:02.380\n It's not just beauty.\n\n30:02.380 --> 30:05.500\n Cause you could argue there's more elegant sort of Uchimata\n\n30:05.500 --> 30:07.300\n is very beautiful and effortless.\n\n30:07.300 --> 30:11.780\n I love something about the dominance of it.\n\n30:11.780 --> 30:16.780\n I love the idea in sport of two people\n\n30:17.500 --> 30:19.820\n that are the best in the world.\n\n30:19.820 --> 30:23.100\n And one of them dominating the other.\n\n30:23.100 --> 30:27.860\n And to me, the standing Seinagi, you're lifted off your feet\n\n30:27.860 --> 30:31.780\n and especially when it's done perfectly\n\n30:32.780 --> 30:37.220\n and with really strong resistance from the other person,\n\n30:37.220 --> 30:40.140\n it results in a big slam.\n\n30:40.140 --> 30:41.860\n And that was like beautiful to me.\n\n30:41.860 --> 30:45.580\n That's the Alexander Karelian like big pickups.\n\n30:45.580 --> 30:46.700\n I love that.\n\n30:46.700 --> 30:50.020\n It's interesting, you're correct in so far as\n\n30:50.020 --> 30:52.220\n you're not just going with aesthetic\n\n30:52.220 --> 30:54.820\n and the sense of beauty, but also,\n\n30:54.820 --> 30:59.220\n but you are making as it were value judgments\n\n30:59.220 --> 31:00.060\n about the throw.\n\n31:00.060 --> 31:01.820\n And that's fascinating to me\n\n31:04.100 --> 31:09.020\n because there's two elements to any grappling sport.\n\n31:09.020 --> 31:12.660\n I'm always insistent upon the idea\n\n31:12.660 --> 31:16.100\n that Jiu Jitsu is both an art and a science, okay?\n\n31:16.100 --> 31:18.900\n It has scientific elements in so far as it works\n\n31:18.900 --> 31:20.100\n according to the laws of physics\n\n31:20.100 --> 31:22.340\n and lever and fulcrum, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n31:24.300 --> 31:28.020\n But it also has an aesthetic element\n\n31:28.020 --> 31:31.220\n in so far as you're making choices with technique.\n\n31:31.220 --> 31:33.700\n You're expressing who you are as a person.\n\n31:33.700 --> 31:37.700\n You have 10,000 different variations of moves you could use,\n\n31:37.700 --> 31:39.780\n but you're specifically choosing these.\n\n31:39.780 --> 31:42.780\n That's an element of choice and self expression on your part.\n\n31:42.780 --> 31:44.220\n And in so far as that is true,\n\n31:44.220 --> 31:45.940\n combat sports are not just a science,\n\n31:45.940 --> 31:47.340\n but they're also an art.\n\n31:47.340 --> 31:49.820\n So most combat sports have this sense\n\n31:49.820 --> 31:53.180\n which they have the features of both an art and a science.\n\n31:53.180 --> 31:58.180\n And it's not just about high percentage in your case.\n\n31:59.540 --> 32:02.500\n I mean, me personally, I'm obsessed with percentages.\n\n32:02.500 --> 32:03.340\n What are the ways to make you win?\n\n32:03.340 --> 32:04.380\n That's the science part.\n\n32:04.380 --> 32:08.140\n Yeah, but that's also choices involved, yeah.\n\n32:08.140 --> 32:13.140\n But there is an undeniably aesthetic element\n\n32:13.140 --> 32:17.540\n to martial arts where you, as it were,\n\n32:17.540 --> 32:20.660\n express who you are as a person\n\n32:20.660 --> 32:23.260\n in terms of the techniques you're ultimately going to choose.\n\n32:23.260 --> 32:24.700\n Does that get in the way?\n\n32:24.700 --> 32:26.740\n Do you allow yourself to enjoy\n\n32:26.740 --> 32:28.620\n the aesthetic beauty of a technique?\n\n32:28.620 --> 32:30.140\n Of course, yeah.\n\n32:30.140 --> 32:32.940\n When martial arts are done well,\n\n32:32.940 --> 32:35.460\n it's the most beautiful sport in the world, okay?\n\n32:35.460 --> 32:37.380\n When it's done poorly, it's the ugliest.\n\n32:37.380 --> 32:43.900\n But a beautifully applied submission hold, a perfect throw,\n\n32:43.900 --> 32:47.740\n a superbly set up takedown are among\n\n32:47.740 --> 32:51.860\n the most difficult techniques to execute in all of sports.\n\n32:51.860 --> 32:54.860\n And when they're done well, they're magic to observe.\n\n32:54.860 --> 32:57.460\n But do you prefer certain techniques over others\n\n32:57.460 --> 33:00.100\n because of their, like for example,\n\n33:00.100 --> 33:03.580\n I'll tell you, for me, chokes of all sorts\n\n33:03.580 --> 33:04.740\n with the gi, without the gi,\n\n33:04.740 --> 33:10.660\n probably with the gi is the most beautiful to me, personally.\n\n33:10.660 --> 33:13.980\n I value them above all others.\n\n33:13.980 --> 33:17.620\n People mostly associate myself and my students with leg locking.\n\n33:17.620 --> 33:19.260\n They're usually rather surprised to learn\n\n33:19.260 --> 33:25.060\n that I actually value strangle holds far above leg locks.\n\n33:25.060 --> 33:28.500\n But not for aesthetic reasons, for effectiveness.\n\n33:28.500 --> 33:30.620\n We can talk about that later if you wish.\n\n33:30.620 --> 33:33.300\n Well, let's step back.\n\n33:33.300 --> 33:36.340\n Sorry, we drifted awfully far off topic there.\n\n33:36.340 --> 33:38.860\n I think this is beautiful.\n\n33:38.860 --> 33:43.300\n We drifted along the river of life and martial arts.\n\n33:43.300 --> 33:46.260\n Can you explain the fundamentals of jiu jitsu?\n\n33:46.260 --> 33:51.380\n Yes. If I couldn't, I wouldn't be much of a coach.\n\n33:51.380 --> 33:56.420\n Jiu jitsu is an art and science\n\n33:56.420 --> 34:00.820\n which looks to use a combination of tactical\n\n34:00.820 --> 34:05.700\n and mechanical advantage to focus a very high percentage\n\n34:05.700 --> 34:09.380\n of my strength against a very low percentage\n\n34:09.380 --> 34:13.700\n of my opponent's strength at a critical point on their body,\n\n34:13.700 --> 34:15.940\n such that if I were to exert my strength\n\n34:15.940 --> 34:17.420\n upon that critical point,\n\n34:17.420 --> 34:22.740\n they could no longer continue to fight.\n\n34:22.740 --> 34:27.580\n Well, that's about weapons and defenses.\n\n34:27.580 --> 34:30.860\n But then, is there something more to be said\n\n34:30.860 --> 34:33.940\n about the set of tools that we're talking about?\n\n34:33.940 --> 34:35.300\n That's where the art comes in.\n\n34:35.300 --> 34:38.020\n Because ultimately, you have a set of choices,\n\n34:38.020 --> 34:40.380\n and those choices that you make will be an act\n\n34:40.380 --> 34:42.260\n of self expression on your part.\n\n34:42.260 --> 34:46.100\n Some will prefer this, some will prefer that.\n\n34:46.100 --> 34:48.340\n That's where you come in as an individual.\n\n34:48.340 --> 34:52.060\n That's an overall definition of jiu jitsu,\n\n34:52.060 --> 34:59.340\n of being a set of choices that where you're using\n\n34:59.340 --> 35:02.620\n the things you're powerful in versus the things\n\n35:02.620 --> 35:04.540\n your opponent is weak in.\n\n35:04.540 --> 35:07.700\n No, I was only talking about percentages of body strength.\n\n35:07.700 --> 35:12.020\n If I have, for example, let's say we have two athletes,\n\n35:12.020 --> 35:13.900\n athlete A and athlete B.\n\n35:13.900 --> 35:16.980\n Athlet A has 100 units of strength,\n\n35:16.980 --> 35:18.900\n however we define that overall.\n\n35:18.900 --> 35:20.900\n Athlet B has 50.\n\n35:20.900 --> 35:26.300\n OK, so ostensibly, athlete A is twice as strong as athlete B.\n\n35:26.300 --> 35:29.420\n But athlete B can maneuver his body\n\n35:29.420 --> 35:34.340\n into a set of positions focused around a critical point\n\n35:34.340 --> 35:38.900\n of his opponent's body, where he can apply 40 units of strength\n\n35:38.900 --> 35:41.180\n out of his total of 50.\n\n35:41.180 --> 35:44.780\n His opponent can only defend with 20 units of strength\n\n35:44.780 --> 35:47.020\n out of his total of 100.\n\n35:47.020 --> 35:51.740\n You have now completely reversed the strength discrepancy.\n\n35:51.740 --> 35:54.700\n Originally, athlete A was twice as strong as B.\n\n35:54.700 --> 35:57.820\n Now, on that one localized point, the knee, the elbow,\n\n35:57.820 --> 36:01.100\n the neck, B is now twice as strong as A.\n\n36:01.100 --> 36:04.540\n Under those circumstances, B should win.\n\n36:04.540 --> 36:07.980\n I guess what I'm trying to get at, by the way,\n\n36:07.980 --> 36:12.420\n that's really beautifully said, is what you just said\n\n36:12.420 --> 36:16.940\n could be applied to other games, other battles.\n\n36:16.940 --> 36:19.060\n It could be applied to the game of chess.\n\n36:19.060 --> 36:22.420\n It could be applied to war, most obviously in war.\n\n36:22.420 --> 36:26.940\n I think about, for example, the American strategic bombing\n\n36:26.940 --> 36:30.100\n campaign in World War II.\n\n36:30.100 --> 36:32.220\n The Eighth Army Air Force was tasked\n\n36:32.220 --> 36:34.340\n with the idea of destroying German industry.\n\n36:37.100 --> 36:39.380\n Did they attack all of German industry?\n\n36:39.380 --> 36:40.140\n Of course not.\n\n36:40.140 --> 36:41.980\n That would be stupid.\n\n36:41.980 --> 36:45.300\n They attacked the ball bearing industry.\n\n36:45.300 --> 36:46.620\n Why?\n\n36:46.620 --> 36:51.180\n Because almost all of modern machines\n\n36:51.180 --> 36:54.820\n require ball bearings in order to operate.\n\n36:54.820 --> 36:56.900\n In order for the mechanical interfaces of machines\n\n36:56.900 --> 36:58.620\n to operate, you have to reduce friction.\n\n36:58.620 --> 37:01.020\n It's done through ball bearings.\n\n37:01.020 --> 37:06.020\n If you knocked out one tiny component of German industry,\n\n37:06.020 --> 37:09.980\n the ball bearing industry, the rest of it couldn't operate.\n\n37:09.980 --> 37:11.580\n So too with the human body.\n\n37:11.580 --> 37:13.300\n I didn't have to fight your whole body.\n\n37:13.300 --> 37:15.780\n I just have to fight your left knee.\n\n37:15.780 --> 37:17.780\n If I can break your left knee, the rest of your body\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:19.620\n is irrelevant to me.\n\n37:19.620 --> 37:24.620\n But then isn't the art of jiu jitsu discovering\n\n37:24.620 --> 37:29.620\n the left knee, discovering the weak points?\n\n37:29.980 --> 37:32.540\n Yeah, a huge part of jiu jitsu is understanding\n\n37:32.540 --> 37:35.220\n the strengths and weaknesses of the human body.\n\n37:35.220 --> 37:38.780\n There's parts of the human body that are shockingly robust\n\n37:38.780 --> 37:41.500\n and there are other parts that are shockingly vulnerable.\n\n37:41.500 --> 37:45.180\n The major joints, and of course the most vulnerable of all,\n\n37:45.180 --> 37:46.540\n the unprotected neck.\n\n37:46.540 --> 37:49.660\n So if we take something I'm not familiar with\n\n37:49.660 --> 37:52.900\n but I was incredibly impressed by is the body lock\n\n37:52.900 --> 37:57.900\n that I saw Nick Rodriguez use last time a few weeks ago.\n\n38:00.980 --> 38:03.820\n But then I also got to hang out with Craig Jones\n\n38:03.820 --> 38:04.660\n who showed that.\n\n38:04.660 --> 38:06.620\n He also has a very good body lock.\n\n38:06.620 --> 38:10.600\n So that was, I don't know if this body lock applies\n\n38:10.600 --> 38:14.540\n to all positions, but I was seeing it from when Craig\n\n38:14.540 --> 38:19.540\n is on top of the opponent and trying to pass in the guard,\n\n38:22.300 --> 38:24.820\n use the body lock as a controlling position.\n\n38:24.820 --> 38:28.500\n The principle behind it is that it shuts down,\n\n38:28.500 --> 38:33.500\n as you've spoken about, it shuts down the weapons\n\n38:34.060 --> 38:36.220\n of a very strong opponent.\n\n38:36.220 --> 38:37.220\n That's absolutely correct.\n\n38:37.220 --> 38:42.220\n In the case of guard position, what makes guard position\n\n38:42.220 --> 38:47.220\n dangerous, what makes someone a powerful guard player\n\n38:47.220 --> 38:49.540\n is the movement of their hips forward and backward\n\n38:49.540 --> 38:50.460\n and side to side.\n\n38:52.220 --> 38:56.020\n Body locking is designed to shut down that movement\n\n38:56.020 --> 38:57.780\n and does a very fine job of it.\n\n38:57.780 --> 38:59.780\n You'll see all of my students excel at it.\n\n38:59.780 --> 39:02.920\n Gordon Ryan is probably the single best body lock\n\n39:02.920 --> 39:04.200\n guard passer I've ever seen.\n\n39:04.200 --> 39:05.980\n Nicky Ryan is outstanding with it.\n\n39:05.980 --> 39:07.660\n Nick Rodriguez is very good.\n\n39:07.660 --> 39:09.120\n Craig Jones is outstanding.\n\n39:09.120 --> 39:12.820\n All of my students use this for a very simple reason.\n\n39:12.820 --> 39:16.100\n Understand what is the central problem of shutting down\n\n39:16.100 --> 39:18.940\n a dangerous guard player, it's his hips.\n\n39:18.940 --> 39:20.420\n That's what makes him a dangerous leg locker.\n\n39:20.420 --> 39:22.040\n You go up against a dangerous leg locker,\n\n39:22.040 --> 39:25.440\n body lock guard pass, single best way to shut down\n\n39:25.440 --> 39:26.540\n most of his entries.\n\n39:28.420 --> 39:30.380\n We're all strong in leg locks.\n\n39:30.380 --> 39:33.280\n So in our gym, you gotta control the hips\n\n39:33.280 --> 39:34.900\n as soon as possible.\n\n39:34.900 --> 39:36.320\n Otherwise it's gonna be a very difficult thing\n\n39:36.320 --> 39:39.220\n to avoid leg entanglements as you go to pass.\n\n39:39.220 --> 39:43.020\n And across the board, my students excel\n\n39:43.020 --> 39:46.380\n in body lock guard passing.\n\n39:47.560 --> 39:49.780\n They understand what's the most dangerous feature\n\n39:49.780 --> 39:52.300\n their opponent has, the lateral movement of their hips.\n\n39:52.300 --> 39:55.220\n What's the single best way to stop that body lock\n\n39:55.220 --> 39:56.820\n and then work from there.\n\n39:56.820 --> 40:01.140\n So if this asymmetry of power is fundamental to jiu jitsu,\n\n40:01.140 --> 40:02.300\n how do you discover that?\n\n40:02.300 --> 40:05.100\n How did you discover the body lock?\n\n40:05.100 --> 40:09.220\n That as one of many methodologies\n\n40:09.220 --> 40:11.300\n of achieving this asymmetry.\n\n40:11.300 --> 40:12.700\n It would be an overstatement to say\n\n40:12.700 --> 40:14.220\n we discovered the body lock.\n\n40:14.220 --> 40:16.260\n Body lock passing has been around longer\n\n40:16.260 --> 40:17.900\n than we've been around.\n\n40:18.860 --> 40:20.920\n But what I would say is that in a room full\n\n40:20.920 --> 40:23.080\n of dangerous leg lockers, you've gotta have a way\n\n40:23.080 --> 40:25.060\n to shut down the hips.\n\n40:25.060 --> 40:28.460\n And so once we started using body locks,\n\n40:28.460 --> 40:30.260\n we saw that was one excellent way\n\n40:30.260 --> 40:32.200\n to get around that problem.\n\n40:32.200 --> 40:37.200\n But as with all development, it comes from trial and error.\n\n40:37.320 --> 40:40.780\n You will often see people teach the technique\n\n40:40.780 --> 40:43.760\n to a certain level and you see the teaching,\n\n40:43.760 --> 40:45.800\n you're like, there's a lot of inadequacies there.\n\n40:45.800 --> 40:47.880\n And that doesn't cover a lot of the problems\n\n40:47.880 --> 40:49.120\n that we're encountering.\n\n40:49.120 --> 40:52.260\n And so trial and error is the single most important part\n\n40:52.260 --> 40:53.920\n of the development.\n\n40:53.920 --> 40:55.560\n Trial and error in?\n\n40:56.700 --> 40:58.640\n In the training room amongst ourselves.\n\n40:58.640 --> 41:01.520\n In hard training or?\n\n41:01.520 --> 41:04.920\n No, it never begins with hard training or everything.\n\n41:04.920 --> 41:08.000\n Techniques are born the same way we're born.\n\n41:08.000 --> 41:09.840\n Weak and in need of nutrition.\n\n41:13.240 --> 41:16.880\n You have to build them up organically like children.\n\n41:16.880 --> 41:18.800\n And you start with minimal resistance\n\n41:18.800 --> 41:20.560\n and you make progress over time.\n\n41:20.560 --> 41:22.800\n When you first go to the gym, do you put 500 pounds\n\n41:22.800 --> 41:24.720\n on the bench press and try to bench press it?\n\n41:24.720 --> 41:25.960\n No, you'll be killed.\n\n41:25.960 --> 41:29.080\n You start off with the bar, you build over time\n\n41:29.080 --> 41:30.880\n and then one day, five years from now,\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:33.200\n you really are lifting 500 pounds.\n\n41:33.200 --> 41:36.200\n But only a forward attempt, they're on their first attempt.\n\n41:38.120 --> 41:41.840\n And they're born like children in your mind first?\n\n41:41.840 --> 41:43.680\n Like there's a spark of an idea.\n\n41:43.680 --> 41:45.040\n Yes, there's always a spark.\n\n41:45.040 --> 41:48.320\n It's like scientific development on a subject matter\n\n41:48.320 --> 41:51.340\n which is intrinsically simpler.\n\n41:51.340 --> 41:56.340\n Okay, there's a sense in which naive\n\n41:56.560 --> 41:58.960\n and overly simplistic assessments\n\n41:58.960 --> 42:01.560\n of scientific method may not work well\n\n42:01.560 --> 42:03.920\n at advanced levels of science, but they work damn well\n\n42:03.920 --> 42:05.440\n in the training room with jiu jitsu\n\n42:05.440 --> 42:08.800\n where the subject matter is inherently simpler\n\n42:08.800 --> 42:10.840\n than it is in research science.\n\n42:10.840 --> 42:15.320\n And as a result, there'll be a spark.\n\n42:15.320 --> 42:17.760\n You'll see something, there's possibilities there.\n\n42:17.760 --> 42:21.400\n Okay, let's puzzle this out, let's work with this.\n\n42:21.400 --> 42:24.000\n And you run into a lot of failures.\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:27.340\n You've suddenly been, oh man, if I put my hip this way,\n\n42:27.340 --> 42:28.180\n this works really well.\n\n42:28.180 --> 42:29.280\n And then suddenly you just try and spar\n\n42:29.280 --> 42:31.320\n and you get caught in a simple, normal platter.\n\n42:31.320 --> 42:32.600\n And you're like, okay, that didn't work as well\n\n42:32.600 --> 42:33.520\n as I thought.\n\n42:33.520 --> 42:35.520\n And then you look to rectify things.\n\n42:35.520 --> 42:38.080\n If things go in promising research directions,\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:38.920\n you keep them.\n\n42:38.920 --> 42:41.040\n If not, you discard them.\n\n42:41.040 --> 42:42.320\n Well, it's funny you say science.\n\n42:42.320 --> 42:44.240\n It feels more like art.\n\n42:44.240 --> 42:46.480\n There's somebody I really admire\n\n42:46.480 --> 42:48.440\n that talks about this kind of ideas.\n\n42:48.440 --> 42:51.600\n Johnny I from Apple, he's the lead designer.\n\n42:51.600 --> 42:54.160\n He recently left, but he was the designer\n\n42:54.160 --> 42:57.520\n behind most of the products we know and love from Apple.\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:00.040\n When you say designer, be more precise.\n\n43:00.040 --> 43:02.640\n What exactly was he working on in Apple?\n\n43:03.680 --> 43:05.240\n The iPhone.\n\n43:05.240 --> 43:07.760\n Which parts of the iPhone did he work on?\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:09.640\n The entirety of it.\n\n43:09.640 --> 43:12.520\n Was he a leader of a research team\n\n43:12.520 --> 43:14.800\n or was he the person personally responsible\n\n43:14.800 --> 43:15.720\n for the development?\n\n43:15.720 --> 43:20.720\n He's kind of, I would say, very similar to your position.\n\n43:22.200 --> 43:25.960\n He wasn't necessarily the last, the person executing\n\n43:25.960 --> 43:27.760\n the fine, the manufacturer, right?\n\n43:27.760 --> 43:28.600\n Yeah, of course.\n\n43:28.600 --> 43:33.160\n But there's the, he's somebody that's very hands on.\n\n43:33.160 --> 43:37.120\n And it's like, okay, so he worked obviously\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:38.960\n extremely close to Steve Jobs.\n\n43:38.960 --> 43:41.100\n Steve Jobs has this idea.\n\n43:41.100 --> 43:42.840\n We should have a computer that's as thin\n\n43:42.840 --> 43:45.520\n as a sheet of paper, and then you start to play\n\n43:45.520 --> 43:48.360\n with ideas of like, what does that actually look like?\n\n43:48.360 --> 43:51.680\n The reason I bring it up is because he talked about,\n\n43:51.680 --> 43:54.980\n he had these ideas that he would not tell Steve\n\n43:54.980 --> 43:58.200\n because he talked about in the same exact language\n\n43:58.200 --> 44:01.800\n as you're saying, is there's like a little baby\n\n44:01.800 --> 44:04.020\n that it's very fragile.\n\n44:05.000 --> 44:07.360\n It needs time to grow.\n\n44:07.360 --> 44:08.200\n Absolutely.\n\n44:08.200 --> 44:10.600\n And then Steve Jobs would often roll in.\n\n44:10.600 --> 44:11.560\n Was too ruthless?\n\n44:11.560 --> 44:12.640\n Too ruthless.\n\n44:12.640 --> 44:15.240\n This is, he would destroy ideas.\n\n44:15.240 --> 44:19.680\n Because Johnny Ive and the team didn't have\n\n44:19.680 --> 44:23.480\n actually good responses to the criticism at first.\n\n44:23.480 --> 44:27.360\n Because when they're babies, you can't defend the baby.\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:29.520\n But you need a time to develop.\n\n44:29.520 --> 44:30.800\n You need to sleep on it.\n\n44:30.800 --> 44:33.160\n You need to rethink it, dream things\n\n44:33.160 --> 44:34.960\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n44:34.960 --> 44:36.360\n It's fascinating you say this, Lex,\n\n44:36.360 --> 44:39.700\n because this is actually the entire history\n\n44:39.700 --> 44:43.660\n of scientific development is literally the story\n\n44:43.660 --> 44:47.440\n of the juxtaposition between the need to protect\n\n44:47.440 --> 44:50.880\n and nurture new theories versus the need\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:54.360\n to rigorously test them with harsh testing\n\n44:54.360 --> 44:58.120\n that either verifies them or falsifies them.\n\n44:58.120 --> 45:01.140\n And learning to find a satisfactory compromise\n\n45:01.140 --> 45:04.180\n between those two is a very, very difficult thing.\n\n45:04.180 --> 45:06.660\n When you look at the history of science,\n\n45:06.660 --> 45:10.560\n you will see that there's some pretty damn chaotic moments\n\n45:10.560 --> 45:12.920\n anytime there's major theory change\n\n45:12.920 --> 45:21.160\n where all kinds of apparently undesirable tricks\n\n45:21.160 --> 45:23.360\n are used to protect certain theories\n\n45:23.360 --> 45:25.960\n with ad hoc hypotheses, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:34.400\n And ultimately, only time and success over time\n\n45:34.400 --> 45:36.480\n will justify a theory.\n\n45:36.480 --> 45:39.000\n There's usually a period where when one theory goes in\n\n45:39.000 --> 45:41.100\n to replace another, there's something\n\n45:41.100 --> 45:44.720\n of a battle between competing groups of scientists, some\n\n45:44.720 --> 45:47.840\n of whom advocate theory A, some who advocate theory B.\n\n45:47.840 --> 45:52.140\n They often use seemingly unscrupulous methods\n\n45:52.140 --> 45:54.400\n to protect or attack another person's theory.\n\n45:54.400 --> 45:56.000\n They dig for proofs.\n\n45:56.000 --> 45:59.100\n And usually, some period of time has to go by.\n\n45:59.100 --> 46:00.920\n Sometimes, in some cases, it simply\n\n46:00.920 --> 46:03.800\n involved older scientists protecting an initial theory\n\n46:03.800 --> 46:09.080\n dying off and new scientists just replacing them\n\n46:09.080 --> 46:10.240\n with numbers.\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:13.840\n And this is a common, common theme.\n\n46:13.840 --> 46:16.320\n And the same applies in jiu jitsu.\n\n46:16.320 --> 46:18.760\n So many times, especially when I first\n\n46:18.760 --> 46:22.960\n started working with leg locks, I would show things\n\n46:22.960 --> 46:28.640\n I had worked on to even world champion black belts.\n\n46:28.640 --> 46:31.840\n And they would try it once or twice and fail and be like,\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:33.880\n yeah, it doesn't work.\n\n46:33.880 --> 46:37.920\n And I'd be like, you tried it once on another guy who's\n\n46:37.920 --> 46:42.440\n also a world champion who has a strong ability to resist it.\n\n46:42.440 --> 46:43.880\n And that's it.\n\n46:43.880 --> 46:44.400\n No more.\n\n46:44.400 --> 46:45.480\n It doesn't work.\n\n46:45.480 --> 46:47.960\n And then five years later, they would\n\n46:47.960 --> 46:52.000\n see my students finishing world champions with it.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.400\n And in some cases, finishing the very people\n\n46:54.400 --> 46:57.720\n who said that the technique would never work.\n\n46:57.720 --> 47:01.400\n I mean, if there was ever a refutation of a statement,\n\n47:01.400 --> 47:05.000\n that's a pretty clear example.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:08.240\n And there has to be a sense in which you\n\n47:08.240 --> 47:09.720\n can't be too forgiving.\n\n47:09.720 --> 47:11.800\n You have to test hypotheses.\n\n47:11.800 --> 47:14.040\n But on the other hand, you can't be too ruthless either.\n\n47:14.040 --> 47:17.760\n You have to look for promise.\n\n47:17.760 --> 47:22.080\n And my advice is start slow.\n\n47:22.080 --> 47:23.920\n Again, the analogy of lifting weights.\n\n47:23.920 --> 47:26.300\n You don't lift the heaviest weights on your first day.\n\n47:26.300 --> 47:26.800\n You build up.\n\n47:26.800 --> 47:30.000\n You work progressively over time.\n\n47:30.000 --> 47:32.680\n Now, you also have to have some common sense here.\n\n47:32.680 --> 47:35.200\n You can't be too forgiving to a technique\n\n47:35.200 --> 47:38.960\n if it's repeatedly failing and good people have tried it\n\n47:38.960 --> 47:40.720\n and multiple good people have tried it\n\n47:40.720 --> 47:43.000\n and it's just not working out, then, OK, it's\n\n47:43.000 --> 47:44.240\n time to dismiss it.\n\n47:44.240 --> 47:46.440\n But don't be too quick.\n\n47:46.440 --> 47:50.920\n Is this where your idea of training with lower belts\n\n47:50.920 --> 47:52.680\n quite a bit comes from?\n\n47:52.680 --> 47:54.280\n I've actually just, as a side comment,\n\n47:54.280 --> 48:00.000\n and maybe you can elaborate, the place, the gym,\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:02.800\n Balanced Studios with Phil and Rick McGarry's where I got\n\n48:02.800 --> 48:05.240\n my black belt, where I grew up as a jujitsu person\n\n48:05.240 --> 48:08.680\n in Philadelphia, they have a huge number of black belts,\n\n48:08.680 --> 48:13.080\n but they have a huge number of all other ranks.\n\n48:13.080 --> 48:16.120\n And the way they picked sparring partners,\n\n48:16.120 --> 48:18.160\n people you train with, is very ad hoc.\n\n48:18.160 --> 48:18.920\n It's very loose.\n\n48:18.920 --> 48:21.680\n It's one of those places, one of those gyms\n\n48:21.680 --> 48:25.920\n where you can train for like three, four hours.\n\n48:25.920 --> 48:29.520\n And you could take a break or you could jump back in.\n\n48:29.520 --> 48:30.480\n Very informal.\n\n48:30.480 --> 48:32.600\n And you can go to war with black belts,\n\n48:32.600 --> 48:34.760\n but then you can also play around\n\n48:34.760 --> 48:37.120\n with the purple and the blue belts and so on.\n\n48:37.120 --> 48:39.360\n And that was really beneficial for growth.\n\n48:39.360 --> 48:43.080\n And you can pick which, because everybody has a style,\n\n48:43.080 --> 48:45.920\n and you can pick which style you really want to work on.\n\n48:45.920 --> 48:51.680\n And then I came to Boston, Broadway Jiu Jitsu,\n\n48:51.680 --> 48:53.280\n with John Clark, who I love.\n\n48:53.280 --> 48:54.440\n He's a good friend.\n\n48:54.440 --> 48:58.160\n But it's a little bit more formal.\n\n48:58.160 --> 49:01.000\n And I found myself, it was a very interesting journey.\n\n49:01.000 --> 49:03.880\n I would be training with black belts the whole time.\n\n49:03.880 --> 49:07.960\n And it was a very different experience.\n\n49:07.960 --> 49:10.640\n I found myself exploring much less.\n\n49:10.640 --> 49:14.000\n I found myself learning much less.\n\n49:14.000 --> 49:16.280\n I mean, part of that is on me,\n\n49:16.280 --> 49:20.240\n but part of it was also realizing that,\n\n49:20.240 --> 49:23.480\n wow, there's a value to training with people\n\n49:23.480 --> 49:24.960\n that are much worse than you.\n\n49:24.960 --> 49:28.400\n Yes, is there a philosophy you could speak to on that?\n\n49:28.400 --> 49:31.680\n Yeah, you probably know it already.\n\n49:31.680 --> 49:34.320\n You know from your studies in artificial intelligence\n\n49:34.320 --> 49:37.560\n that all human beings are naturally risk averse.\n\n49:37.560 --> 49:42.560\n This is a bias which is deeply seated in all of us.\n\n49:42.560 --> 49:45.800\n I'm sure you're well read on people like Tversky and et\n\n49:45.800 --> 49:48.920\n cetera, who talk about this all the time.\n\n49:48.920 --> 49:52.480\n For your viewers, there are numerous psychological\n\n49:52.480 --> 49:55.640\n experiments that are showing that most people,\n\n49:55.640 --> 49:59.840\n to the point of irrationality, fear loss more\n\n49:59.840 --> 50:04.880\n than they are excited at the prospect of an equivalent gain.\n\n50:04.880 --> 50:08.200\n So for example, if you have $100 in your wallet,\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:11.520\n you're more worried about the idea of losing the $100\n\n50:11.520 --> 50:13.360\n that you have now than you would be\n\n50:13.360 --> 50:17.480\n excited by the prospect of gaining $100 that I could\n\n50:17.480 --> 50:18.480\n potentially offer you.\n\n50:18.480 --> 50:22.520\n This comes out whenever you get black belt versus black belt\n\n50:22.520 --> 50:27.240\n confrontations or any kind of similar skill level.\n\n50:27.240 --> 50:31.080\n Whenever you get similar skill levels,\n\n50:31.080 --> 50:34.720\n the chances of defeat get very, very high.\n\n50:34.720 --> 50:36.320\n Interestingly, if you're a white belt\n\n50:36.320 --> 50:38.200\n and you're going against a black belt, you'll take risk.\n\n50:38.200 --> 50:39.200\n Why?\n\n50:39.200 --> 50:40.960\n Because there's no shame in losing to a black belt\n\n50:40.960 --> 50:41.960\n when you're a white belt.\n\n50:41.960 --> 50:43.800\n So you'll play more lightheartedly\n\n50:43.800 --> 50:45.800\n and you'll have a more fun role.\n\n50:45.800 --> 50:49.400\n But when you have very similar skill levels,\n\n50:49.400 --> 50:51.400\n you're going to come back to what?\n\n50:51.400 --> 50:57.000\n The techniques that are most likely to get you a win.\n\n50:57.000 --> 51:00.440\n That number of techniques is usually pretty small.\n\n51:00.440 --> 51:04.880\n And if you're always battling with the same tough opponents\n\n51:04.880 --> 51:08.400\n every day, where if you make even a single error,\n\n51:08.400 --> 51:11.160\n it will cost you that match inspiring\n\n51:11.160 --> 51:13.120\n and you don't like losing, you're\n\n51:13.120 --> 51:17.080\n going to stay with a very small set of moves.\n\n51:17.080 --> 51:20.200\n You might get slightly better at direct execution over time,\n\n51:20.200 --> 51:22.960\n but you as an individual will not grow.\n\n51:22.960 --> 51:28.120\n Growth, as it does in organic life forms,\n\n51:28.120 --> 51:33.120\n comes from small beginnings and builds over time.\n\n51:33.120 --> 51:36.640\n You can't take an untested, untried move\n\n51:36.640 --> 51:39.040\n and get it on a world champion black belt.\n\n51:39.040 --> 51:45.400\n It's going to get crushed, so it's not ready for that.\n\n51:45.400 --> 51:48.560\n It's like a lion cub being thrown out\n\n51:48.560 --> 51:50.600\n into the Serengeti plains.\n\n51:50.600 --> 51:53.880\n A lion cub is just too small and too ineffective.\n\n51:53.880 --> 51:56.400\n It's a lion, but it's a cub.\n\n51:56.400 --> 51:58.080\n And it's not until it grows into maturity\n\n51:58.080 --> 52:00.640\n that it can be a lion that can dominate the Serengeti plains.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:07.080\n That's why I always encourage my students to play\n\n52:07.080 --> 52:11.760\n with a variety of belt types and spend\n\n52:11.760 --> 52:15.600\n the majority of their time with lesser belts\n\n52:15.600 --> 52:16.720\n for development purposes.\n\n52:16.720 --> 52:18.480\n When you're getting closer to a competition,\n\n52:18.480 --> 52:19.920\n you obviously want to change that.\n\n52:19.920 --> 52:22.840\n You want to be getting more a competitive sense\n\n52:22.840 --> 52:27.480\n of hard work, but you must learn to divide up your training\n\n52:27.480 --> 52:31.840\n cycles into non competition cycles\n\n52:31.840 --> 52:35.120\n where you're presumably working with people\n\n52:35.120 --> 52:37.360\n who are slightly lower in level than yourself,\n\n52:37.360 --> 52:40.360\n and in some cases, quite a bit lower than yourself.\n\n52:40.360 --> 52:43.200\n And then competition cycles where\n\n52:43.200 --> 52:46.800\n you're working with people much closer to your own skill level.\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:50.040\n Is there something to be said about the flip side of that,\n\n52:50.040 --> 52:54.240\n which is when you're training with people at the same skill\n\n52:54.240 --> 52:57.520\n level, being OK losing to them?\n\n52:57.520 --> 52:58.320\n Yes.\n\n52:58.320 --> 53:01.000\n You have to see training for what it is.\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:03.160\n Training is about skill development,\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:04.800\n not about winning or losing.\n\n53:04.800 --> 53:08.640\n You've got to understand that you\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:10.800\n don't need to win every battle.\n\n53:10.800 --> 53:13.600\n You only need to win the battles that count.\n\n53:13.600 --> 53:16.400\n And the battles that count are in the world championship\n\n53:16.400 --> 53:17.640\n finals.\n\n53:17.640 --> 53:18.840\n That's the one that counts.\n\n53:18.840 --> 53:20.720\n Think about that win.\n\n53:20.720 --> 53:22.920\n That's the one you're going to be remembered for.\n\n53:22.920 --> 53:24.920\n You're not going to be remembered for the battle you\n\n53:24.920 --> 53:27.800\n lost on Tuesday afternoon at 3 PM in some nameless gym\n\n53:27.800 --> 53:29.920\n with some guy that no one cares about.\n\n53:29.920 --> 53:31.400\n No one's going to remember that.\n\n53:31.400 --> 53:33.640\n You're going to be remembered for your peak performances,\n\n53:33.640 --> 53:35.480\n not your everyday performances.\n\n53:35.480 --> 53:38.720\n Focus your everyday performances on skill development\n\n53:38.720 --> 53:43.960\n so that your peak performances you can focus on winning.\n\n53:43.960 --> 53:48.800\n This is not a therapy session, but if I could just speak.\n\n53:48.800 --> 53:52.040\n Every session's a therapy session.\n\n53:52.040 --> 53:56.680\n There is still an ape thing in there.\n\n53:56.680 --> 53:57.160\n Of course.\n\n53:57.160 --> 53:59.600\n You think I don't feel it?\n\n53:59.600 --> 54:02.200\n You think everyone in the room doesn't feel it?\n\n54:02.200 --> 54:06.840\n Because, for example, you have never seen me roll.\n\n54:06.840 --> 54:10.520\n When there's people, I've seen the look in people's eyes\n\n54:10.520 --> 54:12.640\n when they see me train.\n\n54:12.640 --> 54:16.080\n And I could see, maybe it's me projecting,\n\n54:16.080 --> 54:18.880\n but they think, I thought you were supposed to be good.\n\n54:18.880 --> 54:22.160\n I thought you were supposed to be a black belt.\n\n54:22.160 --> 54:24.240\n That look, they're like studying.\n\n54:24.240 --> 54:25.880\n I'm going to give you some therapy.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:26.400\n OK.\n\n54:26.400 --> 54:32.600\n Do you know how many people have come up\n\n54:32.600 --> 54:37.400\n to me over the years who have visited the training\n\n54:37.400 --> 54:39.920\n halls that I work in, and they come up to me and they go,\n\n54:39.920 --> 54:43.880\n man, I rolled with Gary Tonin.\n\n54:43.880 --> 54:48.480\n I did really well with him, like really well.\n\n54:48.480 --> 54:52.360\n I'm like, oh, that's very good, very impressive.\n\n54:52.360 --> 54:55.680\n And then I see them talking to their friends, like, man,\n\n54:55.680 --> 54:56.840\n I tapped out Gary Tonin.\n\n54:59.800 --> 55:04.040\n And I'm sitting there going, yeah.\n\n55:04.040 --> 55:06.960\n And you can see that they're just like, whoa, dude,\n\n55:06.960 --> 55:10.040\n I'm way better than I thought I was.\n\n55:10.040 --> 55:14.800\n Gary Tonin, all of my students, I\n\n55:14.800 --> 55:19.160\n push them in the direction of giving up bad positions\n\n55:19.160 --> 55:21.000\n so that they practice working, getting out\n\n55:21.000 --> 55:22.080\n of critical situations.\n\n55:22.080 --> 55:24.160\n It's a huge part of our training program.\n\n55:24.160 --> 55:26.240\n But Gary Tonin takes that to a level\n\n55:26.240 --> 55:28.360\n that just no one else even gets close.\n\n55:28.360 --> 55:30.560\n It's just amazing.\n\n55:30.560 --> 55:34.440\n He will put himself in impossible situations\n\n55:34.440 --> 55:40.240\n where it's a fully locked strangle, 100% on with both\n\n55:40.240 --> 55:42.280\n his arms behind his back.\n\n55:42.280 --> 55:44.800\n And he'll try to work out from there.\n\n55:44.800 --> 55:48.560\n And seven times out of 10, he does.\n\n55:48.560 --> 55:52.960\n But three times out of 10, he gets caught.\n\n55:52.960 --> 55:55.880\n I'm a huge advocate of handicap training,\n\n55:55.880 --> 55:59.680\n where you handicap yourself to work on skills.\n\n55:59.680 --> 56:04.360\n He's took that to heart to a level that few people, I\n\n56:04.360 --> 56:05.720\n believe, can match.\n\n56:05.720 --> 56:08.000\n I just wonder what his psychology is like, because there's.\n\n56:08.000 --> 56:10.480\n It goes back to what we talked about before, Lex.\n\n56:10.480 --> 56:13.640\n You have to understand it's skill development.\n\n56:13.640 --> 56:16.280\n Don't take it personally.\n\n56:16.280 --> 56:16.960\n I understand.\n\n56:16.960 --> 56:18.400\n I hear where you're coming from.\n\n56:18.400 --> 56:21.040\n We've all got what you call the ape reflex, where\n\n56:21.040 --> 56:22.720\n we want to be dominant, OK?\n\n56:22.720 --> 56:23.680\n We all do.\n\n56:23.680 --> 56:25.680\n Because there's thousands of white belts out there\n\n56:25.680 --> 56:28.880\n that have tapped Gary Tonan, and they're walking around,\n\n56:28.880 --> 56:30.200\n and they're posting online.\n\n56:30.200 --> 56:32.560\n I tapped Gary Tonan.\n\n56:32.560 --> 56:34.400\n Gary Tonan's one of the best in the world,\n\n56:34.400 --> 56:36.400\n so I'm one of the best in the world.\n\n56:36.400 --> 56:40.200\n And does Gary get upset about this?\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:41.080\n No, of course not.\n\n56:41.080 --> 56:43.400\n Because Gary knows that when it counts on stage,\n\n56:43.400 --> 56:46.720\n he's going to be going 100% with a set of skills\n\n56:46.720 --> 56:49.600\n that very few people can match.\n\n56:49.600 --> 56:53.920\n He can go into an EBI overtime at the 205 pound weight\n\n56:53.920 --> 56:57.560\n division against an ADCC champion,\n\n56:57.560 --> 57:00.600\n starting in a full arm lock position,\n\n57:00.600 --> 57:04.680\n and effortlessly get out with no problems in seconds.\n\n57:04.680 --> 57:08.960\n Because he's been in that situation 25,000 times\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:12.760\n with varying degrees of skilled opponents.\n\n57:12.760 --> 57:16.160\n And there's just no panic, no fear.\n\n57:16.160 --> 57:20.280\n He's just doing what he's done so many thousands of times.\n\n57:20.280 --> 57:24.200\n And that's a fine, fine example of a guy\n\n57:24.200 --> 57:26.760\n who didn't give a damn what happened in the training room,\n\n57:26.760 --> 57:30.560\n but when it counted on the stage, in front of the cameras,\n\n57:30.560 --> 57:32.120\n it kicked in.\n\n57:32.120 --> 57:35.360\n Yeah, he's an incredible inspiration, actually.\n\n57:35.360 --> 57:38.400\n He's a practitioner of something you've recently\n\n57:38.400 --> 57:40.560\n talked quite a bit about, which is the power\n\n57:40.560 --> 57:43.180\n of escaping sort of bad positions.\n\n57:43.180 --> 57:46.340\n I think you've talked about it,\n\n57:46.340 --> 57:47.900\n which is really interesting framing,\n\n57:47.900 --> 57:52.900\n is escaping bad positions is one of the best ways,\n\n57:54.140 --> 57:58.740\n if not the best way, to demonstrate dominance\n\n57:58.740 --> 58:01.340\n psychologically over your opponent.\n\n58:01.340 --> 58:04.020\n That anything they throw at you,\n\n58:05.180 --> 58:07.540\n like their weapons are useless against you.\n\n58:08.700 --> 58:10.260\n There's a little bit of Lex Friedman\n\n58:10.260 --> 58:11.740\n kicking through on this question.\n\n58:11.740 --> 58:16.740\n Your obsession with dominance is skewing your point of view.\n\n58:16.740 --> 58:19.380\n It's a therapy session, it's a therapy session.\n\n58:19.380 --> 58:22.420\n I'm coming from a wrestling perspective.\n\n58:22.420 --> 58:23.980\n I think it's not just Lex Friedman.\n\n58:23.980 --> 58:25.020\n I think it's Dan Gable.\n\n58:25.020 --> 58:26.900\n I think it's dominant.\n\n58:26.900 --> 58:31.160\n The Gary Tonin ethic, it just goes against everything\n\n58:31.160 --> 58:32.300\n wrestling is about.\n\n58:32.300 --> 58:35.600\n You never put yourself in a bad position.\n\n58:35.600 --> 58:39.700\n And the fact, it's a, philosophically,\n\n58:39.700 --> 58:40.780\n I don't know what to do with it.\n\n58:40.780 --> 58:45.720\n It's a total reframing of showing dominance\n\n58:45.720 --> 58:49.060\n by escaping any bad position.\n\n58:49.060 --> 58:49.900\n Yeah.\n\n58:49.900 --> 58:53.580\n Let's talk about the idea of what is the value of escapes?\n\n58:53.580 --> 58:56.820\n Why do I put this in as the first skill\n\n58:56.820 --> 58:59.840\n that every Jiu Jitsu student must master?\n\n59:01.540 --> 59:05.380\n Believe it or not, when I talked about how it\n\n59:07.780 --> 59:09.280\n pertains to dominance,\n\n59:09.280 --> 59:11.380\n that's its smallest value.\n\n59:12.320 --> 59:14.980\n Its greatest value has nothing to do with dominance.\n\n59:14.980 --> 59:16.480\n It has to do with confidence.\n\n59:19.300 --> 59:22.540\n You can train someone and teach them technique\n\n59:22.540 --> 59:24.260\n until you're blue in the face.\n\n59:25.420 --> 59:29.340\n But at some point, the athlete in question\n\n59:29.340 --> 59:33.460\n has to go out there on the stage and pull the trigger\n\n59:33.460 --> 59:34.720\n when the time is right.\n\n59:34.720 --> 59:37.720\n What's going to give you that ability\n\n59:37.720 --> 59:41.960\n to go from the physical skills that you've learned\n\n59:41.960 --> 59:45.720\n to execution under pressure is confidence.\n\n59:51.960 --> 59:54.160\n I always talk about skill development.\n\n59:54.160 --> 59:57.320\n And yes, skill development is the absolute bedrock\n\n59:57.320 --> 59:58.760\n of my training programs.\n\n59:58.760 --> 1:00:02.680\n But you can't finish at that level.\n\n1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:04.840\n There has to be something more than that.\n\n1:00:04.840 --> 1:00:08.280\n And you have to go from the physical element of skill\n\n1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:11.280\n into the psychological element of confidence.\n\n1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:14.680\n I can teach you an armbar all day.\n\n1:00:14.680 --> 1:00:17.760\n You can get to a point where you can flawlessly execute\n\n1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:20.840\n armbars in drilling and even in a certain level\n\n1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:21.680\n of competition.\n\n1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:25.480\n But if you believe that you can do it,\n\n1:00:25.480 --> 1:00:29.200\n in a certain level of competition, but if you believe\n\n1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:34.720\n that in attempting an armbar on a dangerous opponent\n\n1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:36.280\n with good guard passing skills,\n\n1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:38.880\n say the armbar has been performed from guard position,\n\n1:00:40.440 --> 1:00:45.440\n that if the armbar fails and your opponent uses that failure\n\n1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:49.400\n to set up a strong pass and get into a side pin,\n\n1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:53.000\n possibly into the mount, and you don't have the ability\n\n1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.800\n to get out of that side pin or mount,\n\n1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:58.400\n you won't pull the trigger on the armbar.\n\n1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:02.480\n And so even though you had all the requisite physical skills\n\n1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:06.120\n to perform the technique, when push came to shove\n\n1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:10.720\n and the critical moment came, you backed down.\n\n1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:12.120\n You didn't pull the trigger.\n\n1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.720\n Building that confidence is the key\n\n1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:19.880\n to championship performance.\n\n1:01:19.880 --> 1:01:24.720\n And the single best way to do it is to take away\n\n1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:29.520\n the innate fear that we all have of bad outcomes\n\n1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:33.320\n that makes us naturally risk averse.\n\n1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:35.840\n When you don't believe you can be pinned,\n\n1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:38.240\n when you don't believe your guard can be passed,\n\n1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:41.160\n you'll take risks because there's no downside\n\n1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:42.600\n to your actions.\n\n1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:46.120\n An unpinnable person and an unpassable person\n\n1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:48.760\n doesn't have much to fear in a jiu jitsu match.\n\n1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.640\n You can come out and fire with all guns blazing\n\n1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.280\n because then you know at the end of the day,\n\n1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.480\n no one's gonna hold you down,\n\n1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.400\n no one's gonna pass you guard.\n\n1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.840\n That's your first two goals in jiu jitsu.\n\n1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:00.480\n They're the most boring goals.\n\n1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:01.560\n They're not exciting to learn.\n\n1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:03.560\n No one wants to come in and their first thing we're told,\n\n1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:04.760\n okay, you're gonna practice escapes\n\n1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:06.080\n for the next year of your life.\n\n1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:08.240\n Okay, it's not going, are you kidding me?\n\n1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:11.360\n But that's what you gotta have, that's your first skill.\n\n1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:14.080\n And that's what I push upon all of my students.\n\n1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:17.440\n You'll see almost all of them are very, very strong\n\n1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:18.680\n in escape skills.\n\n1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:21.080\n They know that if things go wrong,\n\n1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:22.760\n they can always get out.\n\n1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:25.000\n They can always live to fight another day.\n\n1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:28.320\n And that is what gives them the ability\n\n1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.000\n to attack without fear.\n\n1:02:31.440 --> 1:02:34.720\n I think that is so profound and so rare.\n\n1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.680\n It's so rare to hear this.\n\n1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.480\n I think it's because it's the most painful thing to do.\n\n1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:43.040\n Always ask yourself,\n\n1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:46.640\n when you enter a jiu jitsu match,\n\n1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.360\n you already know ahead of time,\n\n1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.520\n if you're going to lose, how you're going to lose.\n\n1:02:56.680 --> 1:02:59.880\n Okay, there's only a certain number of realistic submissions\n\n1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:01.040\n that work in the sport of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:03.240\n The number is very small.\n\n1:03:03.240 --> 1:03:06.480\n So ahead of time, you already know\n\n1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:09.760\n the most likely methods of submission loss in jiu jitsu\n\n1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:11.480\n are gonna be things like heel hook,\n\n1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:14.680\n armbar, rear naked strangle, guillotine, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:17.440\n Just work backwards from that knowledge.\n\n1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:20.520\n So start off learning how to defend all of those things.\n\n1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:23.520\n You know what the major losing positions are in jiu jitsu.\n\n1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:25.280\n Someone gets mounted on you, rear mount,\n\n1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:26.640\n side control, knee on belly.\n\n1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:28.800\n Those positions you can only lose from.\n\n1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:30.280\n So work backwards from there,\n\n1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:32.040\n getting out of those positions.\n\n1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:33.800\n And that's how I always start.\n\n1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:35.480\n I always say with my students,\n\n1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:40.240\n I teach beginners from the ground up\n\n1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.120\n and I teach experts backwards.\n\n1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.240\n What does that mean?\n\n1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:48.080\n When a young student comes to me with no skills,\n\n1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.480\n they learn from the ground up.\n\n1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:52.280\n They start on their backs, defending pins.\n\n1:03:52.280 --> 1:03:54.480\n Then they start on their backs working\n\n1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:55.720\n from half guard bottom,\n\n1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:58.440\n then on their backs working from variations of guard.\n\n1:03:58.440 --> 1:04:00.320\n They don't even get to see top position\n\n1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:02.760\n until they're strong off their backs.\n\n1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.400\n Then they go onto their knees and they start passing,\n\n1:04:07.640 --> 1:04:09.520\n start standing and passing.\n\n1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:12.120\n And then they work their pins and transitions.\n\n1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:14.120\n And then ultimately they stand up to their feet\n\n1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:16.600\n and they work standing position on their feet.\n\n1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:20.680\n So they work from ground back on the floor\n\n1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:22.560\n to ground knees on the floor,\n\n1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:24.560\n ground standing and then both athletes standing.\n\n1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:26.200\n It's a gradual progression over time\n\n1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:28.840\n where they work from the bottom to the top.\n\n1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:32.760\n With regards to experts, I teach them end game first.\n\n1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:34.320\n They must become very, very strong\n\n1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:37.440\n in what finishes the match, which is submission holds.\n\n1:04:37.440 --> 1:04:42.440\n Okay, in chess, we always talk about end game.\n\n1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.600\n I do the same thing in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:48.360\n I start experts just looking at the mechanics\n\n1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:51.280\n of breaking people and all the submission holds that I teach.\n\n1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:53.000\n You should know that I teach only\n\n1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.040\n a very small number of submission holds, around six.\n\n1:04:57.960 --> 1:05:00.760\n It's interesting that my students have by far and away\n\n1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:03.640\n the highest submission rate in contemporary Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:05:03.640 --> 1:05:06.680\n but they only learn around six to seven submission holds.\n\n1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:11.680\n I start them with mechanics where they learn the end game,\n\n1:05:13.960 --> 1:05:15.200\n how to break someone.\n\n1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:24.600\n Once they develop in their mind,\n\n1:05:24.600 --> 1:05:29.600\n the belief that if, the conditional if,\n\n1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:32.040\n they can get to one of those six positions,\n\n1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:36.520\n there's a very high likelihood they'll win.\n\n1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:42.520\n If they truly believe then, when it's competition time,\n\n1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:46.200\n they'll fucking find a way to get to those positions.\n\n1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:47.800\n That's confidence.\n\n1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:50.360\n But if you don't believe, let's say you believe,\n\n1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.000\n man, if I get to a finishing position,\n\n1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.960\n an armbar or a strangle,\n\n1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:56.160\n there's only like a 20% chance I'll finish with it.\n\n1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.800\n How hard are you gonna fight to get to that position?\n\n1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:00.080\n You're not.\n\n1:06:00.080 --> 1:06:02.240\n Why, why would you?\n\n1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:04.920\n But if you believe there's a 98% chance,\n\n1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:08.160\n if you get to that position, you'll finish.\n\n1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:09.760\n You'll find a way to get there.\n\n1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:12.080\n That is so powerful.\n\n1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:13.480\n There's certain things,\n\n1:06:13.480 --> 1:06:15.160\n it may be going back to Judo a little bit,\n\n1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:20.160\n is there's a clock choke for people who are listening.\n\n1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:25.280\n It's with the gi when a person is in a turtle position,\n\n1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:27.320\n in a crouching position.\n\n1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:30.240\n And this is something that's done in Judo quite a bit.\n\n1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.520\n But I have, it doesn't matter what the technique is,\n\n1:06:32.520 --> 1:06:35.240\n I have a belief in my head\n\n1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.560\n that there's not a person in the world\n\n1:06:37.560 --> 1:06:40.440\n that I can't choke with that clock choke.\n\n1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:41.560\n That's a good belief to have.\n\n1:06:41.560 --> 1:06:43.480\n And I've done that.\n\n1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:47.920\n And that it was, it built on itself.\n\n1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:52.280\n The belief made the technique better and better and better.\n\n1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.160\n Now you're onto something.\n\n1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:56.720\n That's exactly the mindset that I'm trying to coach.\n\n1:06:56.720 --> 1:06:57.920\n But that's step one.\n\n1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:01.200\n You have to believe that once you get there.\n\n1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:02.680\n But you gotta start somewhere.\n\n1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:03.840\n And then it's step one.\n\n1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:05.040\n But then you have to create a system\n\n1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:06.920\n how to get there. But it's a damn important step.\n\n1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:08.960\n So you coach the end game first,\n\n1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:11.640\n and then you fill in the details afterwards.\n\n1:07:11.640 --> 1:07:13.280\n Yeah, that's a huge confidence builder.\n\n1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:17.920\n But I just, I have to say, to admit,\n\n1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.920\n and it makes me sad, but I think I'm not alone.\n\n1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:23.080\n I think a majority of Jiu Jitsu people are like this,\n\n1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:27.880\n that I didn't do the beginner step that you talk about,\n\n1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:30.760\n which is focusing on escapes.\n\n1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:35.720\n I think I learned the wrong lessons from losing.\n\n1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.480\n I remember in a blue belt competition long ago,\n\n1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.520\n I was, I think it was, yeah,\n\n1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:47.680\n it was the finals of Atlanta IBJJF tournament.\n\n1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:52.680\n And there's a person that passed my guard and he took mount.\n\n1:07:57.080 --> 1:08:01.160\n And he stayed in mount for a long time.\n\n1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:02.760\n And I couldn't breathe.\n\n1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:04.440\n And it was like one of those things\n\n1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:06.440\n where I was truly dominated.\n\n1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:09.040\n I don't think I've been dominated in Jiu Jitsu match\n\n1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:12.560\n quite like that before or after.\n\n1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:15.960\n And the lesson I learned from that is I'm not gonna let,\n\n1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.120\n like as opposed to working on escapes,\n\n1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:22.240\n I'm not gonna let anyone pass my guard.\n\n1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:24.480\n What you learned is don't take risks.\n\n1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:26.480\n Don't take risks.\n\n1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:29.640\n Which is ultimately what kills you.\n\n1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:31.360\n Ultimately, if you become the best you can,\n\n1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:32.400\n you gotta take risks.\n\n1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:34.440\n As they say, nothing risk, nothing gain.\n\n1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:38.400\n Failure usually makes us even more risk averse\n\n1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:39.240\n than we started.\n\n1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:41.320\n We're already mentally biased,\n\n1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:43.360\n being human beings in that direction.\n\n1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:46.120\n And failure tends to reinforce that.\n\n1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:50.240\n I work hard in my training programs\n\n1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:52.560\n to try and correct that fault.\n\n1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:56.240\n Is it still possible for a person who's a black belt\n\n1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.000\n to then just go back to that beginning journey, I guess?\n\n1:08:59.000 --> 1:08:59.840\n Of course.\n\n1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:03.120\n Let me tell you something.\n\n1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:05.720\n I'm probably gonna catch a lot of flack for saying this.\n\n1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:06.760\n I have a belief.\n\n1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:10.000\n I won't say something, I won't call it knowledge\n\n1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.160\n because it's not known, but I have a fervent belief.\n\n1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:19.000\n That human beings in most skill activities,\n\n1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.920\n not all skill activities, but I will say combat sports,\n\n1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:26.200\n for sure, can reinvent themselves in five year periods.\n\n1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:29.200\n Now you might be saying five years?\n\n1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:30.800\n What's magical about five years?\n\n1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:36.320\n Mike Tyson was 13 years old\n\n1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:38.120\n when he was taken in by custom auto.\n\n1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:43.120\n By the age of 18, he was beating world class boxers\n\n1:09:45.880 --> 1:09:50.880\n in the gym and had already made a strong name for himself\n\n1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:52.600\n in international boxing.\n\n1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:54.280\n He was already a known figure.\n\n1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:55.320\n It was five years.\n\n1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:05.160\n Yasuhiro Yamashita, the judo player, began judo at 13.\n\n1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:09.160\n He placed silver in the All Japans at 17.\n\n1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:17.040\n I could go on all day with examples of athletes\n\n1:10:17.360 --> 1:10:22.360\n who within a five year timeframe of starting a sport\n\n1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:25.280\n were competing at world championship level.\n\n1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:29.080\n I'm gonna give you a rough and ready definition\n\n1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:31.000\n of sport mastery, okay?\n\n1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:36.000\n I believe that if you can play a competitive match\n\n1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:41.120\n against someone ranked in the top 25 in your sport,\n\n1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.480\n and it's a serious international sport,\n\n1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:46.880\n I would call you someone who's mastered that sport.\n\n1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.520\n Okay, you're damn good.\n\n1:10:50.720 --> 1:10:54.520\n If you can go with the number 25 wrestler in the world\n\n1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.720\n and give them a hard competitive match in the gym,\n\n1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:59.560\n you may not win it, but they had a good workout,\n\n1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:01.720\n you know, they had a good workout.\n\n1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:05.160\n You have shown mastery of wrestling\n\n1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.920\n or indeed any other combat sport you care to name.\n\n1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.680\n There are numerous examples of people doing far better\n\n1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:21.680\n than that in five years, winning medals\n\n1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:24.040\n at world championships and even Olympic games\n\n1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:26.240\n in that five year period.\n\n1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.120\n This is not an unrealistic goal.\n\n1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:30.120\n There is a lot of empirical evidence to show\n\n1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:32.720\n that people have done this in the past, a lot of it.\n\n1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:37.360\n So if you fully immerse yourself in a sport\n\n1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:40.120\n with a well worked out, well planned training program,\n\n1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.840\n there is a mountain of evidence to show\n\n1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:43.360\n that in a five year period,\n\n1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:47.800\n you can go from a complete beginner\n\n1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:52.800\n to like very, very impressive skill level\n\n1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:54.320\n to the point where you're competitive\n\n1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:56.360\n with some of the best people on the planet.\n\n1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:00.440\n You can reinvent yourself in these five year periods.\n\n1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.000\n What happens with most people is they get to a certain level\n\n1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.280\n and they get complacent, they get lazy\n\n1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.080\n and they just keep doing the same old thing\n\n1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:08.360\n they've been doing.\n\n1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:11.520\n But if you're diligent and you're purposeful,\n\n1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:14.600\n five years, you can accomplish an awful lot\n\n1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:18.000\n and as I said, there's a mountain of evidence to show it.\n\n1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.560\n By the way, as a small aside,\n\n1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:22.840\n somebody who's mentioned Tversky and Yamashita\n\n1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.040\n in the same conversation,\n\n1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:27.120\n you're one of the most impressive people I've ever spoken to.\n\n1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:29.400\n But as a small aside,\n\n1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:33.760\n so if there's this complete beginner,\n\n1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:35.160\n this is really interesting.\n\n1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:39.120\n There is empirical evidence\n\n1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.200\n that you can achieve incredible things\n\n1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:42.600\n in a short amount of time.\n\n1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:47.880\n There's a complete beginner standing before you\n\n1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:50.480\n and that beginner has fire in their eyes\n\n1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:53.680\n and they want to achieve mastery.\n\n1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:58.240\n Where do you place most of the credit\n\n1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:01.520\n for a journey that does achieve mastery?\n\n1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:04.720\n Is it the set of ideas they have in their mind?\n\n1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.360\n Is it the set of drills or the way they practice?\n\n1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:11.600\n Is it genetics and luck?\n\n1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.040\n Those are all good insights.\n\n1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:18.040\n All of those factors you've mentioned play a definite role.\n\n1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:21.520\n Let's start with luck, okay?\n\n1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:24.960\n We are all subject to fortune\n\n1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:28.600\n and fortune can be good and fortune can be bad.\n\n1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:32.120\n Life is in many ways beautiful, but life is also tragic.\n\n1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:36.360\n And I've had students who showed enormous promise\n\n1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:38.720\n and just tragic events occurred in their lives.\n\n1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:43.240\n The vicissitudes of fortune can be\n\n1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:46.120\n a wonderful thing in your life\n\n1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:48.760\n and they can be a terrible tragedy.\n\n1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:53.360\n I've had students who died for various reasons\n\n1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:56.520\n who could have gone on to become world champions.\n\n1:13:56.520 --> 1:13:59.360\n I've had students who on a much lighter note\n\n1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.120\n just fell in love and just wanted to have kids\n\n1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:06.680\n and move away and that's a wonderful thing,\n\n1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:08.040\n but different direction.\n\n1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:10.960\n You just never know.\n\n1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:13.520\n So luck does play some role.\n\n1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:17.040\n Even things like where you're born, the location of,\n\n1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:20.760\n your physical location in the world\n\n1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:24.320\n or even the socioeconomic location can play a role\n\n1:14:24.320 --> 1:14:26.800\n which could be detrimental or favorable.\n\n1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:28.720\n So yeah, luck does play some role.\n\n1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.760\n Thankfully, it's one of the smaller elements.\n\n1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.320\n And I do believe that a truly resourceful mind\n\n1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:41.040\n can overcome the majority of what fortune throws at us\n\n1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:44.120\n and get to goals provided you're sufficiently\n\n1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:45.160\n mentally robust.\n\n1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.200\n Other things you mentioned, genetics.\n\n1:14:51.840 --> 1:14:53.880\n I do believe in certain sports,\n\n1:14:53.880 --> 1:14:58.480\n genetics really do play a powerful, powerful role.\n\n1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:02.800\n For example, in any sport where power output\n\n1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:07.720\n and reaction speed, ability to take physical damage,\n\n1:15:07.720 --> 1:15:11.160\n then there are genetic elements which will help.\n\n1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:15.360\n For example, I couldn't imagine a world\n\n1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:17.440\n in which even if I have a crippled leg,\n\n1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:22.080\n so even if I grew up in a world where my leg was normal\n\n1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:25.200\n and I had normal legs and everything was fine with my body,\n\n1:15:25.200 --> 1:15:30.200\n I don't believe that I could win the Olympic gold medal\n\n1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:32.320\n in 100 meter sprinting, for example.\n\n1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:35.640\n I just don't have enough fast twitch muscle fibers.\n\n1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:40.640\n But the more a sport involves skill and tactics,\n\n1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:44.840\n the less you will see genetics playing a role.\n\n1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:49.320\n If you look at the medal podiums in jiu jitsu, for example,\n\n1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:52.280\n you will see that no one body type\n\n1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:54.840\n is definitively superior to another.\n\n1:15:54.840 --> 1:15:57.360\n You will see every variation of body type\n\n1:15:57.360 --> 1:15:59.720\n and the medal platforms in jiu jitsu.\n\n1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:03.960\n As skill and tactics become more and more important\n\n1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:06.200\n and things like just power output over time\n\n1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.040\n become less and less important,\n\n1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:11.640\n then you will see that genetics play\n\n1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:12.800\n less and less of a role.\n\n1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:15.520\n I'm happy to say that the sport of jiu jitsu,\n\n1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:17.160\n the evidence seems pretty clear\n\n1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:19.040\n that there's no one dominant body type\n\n1:16:19.040 --> 1:16:19.880\n in the sport of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:22.840\n Rather, there's just advantages for one type\n\n1:16:22.840 --> 1:16:24.360\n and there's advantages for another.\n\n1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:27.160\n You just have to learn to tailor your game to your body.\n\n1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:32.600\n With regards to training program,\n\n1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:36.640\n yes, I believe with all my heart and all my soul\n\n1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.120\n that your training program does make a difference.\n\n1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:41.480\n I've dedicated my life to that.\n\n1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.800\n Obviously, I'm biased in this regard.\n\n1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:47.680\n I do believe that all of the students that I taught\n\n1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:50.080\n who became world champions would have been great athletes\n\n1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:51.760\n whether or not they had met me or not.\n\n1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:53.000\n I believe that.\n\n1:16:53.880 --> 1:16:56.920\n But I do also believe it would have taken them a lot longer\n\n1:16:56.920 --> 1:17:00.000\n and they may not have gotten to the level that they did.\n\n1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:01.800\n I'm sure they would have been impressive,\n\n1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:06.040\n but I do believe that the nature of a training program\n\n1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:08.200\n plays an enormous difference.\n\n1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:10.880\n I don't mean to say this in an arrogant way.\n\n1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:13.280\n I believe that there's, again,\n\n1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:15.640\n a mountain of evidence to suggest this is true\n\n1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:17.840\n because you see it in many different sports.\n\n1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:21.680\n Let's talk, for example, about your country, Russia,\n\n1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:23.040\n and its wrestling program.\n\n1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:28.680\n Russia is an enormous country,\n\n1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:32.840\n but the location where Russia's wrestling program comes from\n\n1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:34.120\n is actually very small\n\n1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:36.800\n and the population is actually very small.\n\n1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:39.760\n I can't verify this, but I was told once,\n\n1:17:39.760 --> 1:17:41.720\n I can't verify this, but the number of people\n\n1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:44.920\n who wrestle in Russia is actually significantly smaller\n\n1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:47.800\n than the number of people who wrestle in the United States.\n\n1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:51.480\n It's also not part of the school athletics\n\n1:17:51.480 --> 1:17:52.880\n and it is in the United States.\n\n1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:54.600\n Yes, that's a different point.\n\n1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:55.800\n We'll come back right to that\n\n1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:57.720\n because that's also an important point.\n\n1:17:57.720 --> 1:18:00.280\n But if you look at the actual numbers of people there,\n\n1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:02.040\n they're actually pretty small.\n\n1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:04.640\n So ostensibly, if it comes down to a numbers game,\n\n1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:06.360\n America should dominate at the Olympics\n\n1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:07.800\n because we have more wrestlers.\n\n1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:09.840\n Now, the story gets more complicated\n\n1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:12.240\n because America has a different style of wrestling,\n\n1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:14.440\n the collegiate style than the international freestyle.\n\n1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:16.280\n That is a complicating factor.\n\n1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:21.760\n But nonetheless, what you see there\n\n1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:24.240\n is that numbers aren't everything.\n\n1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:27.680\n Rather, the manner in which people are trained\n\n1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:29.480\n clearly has an impact.\n\n1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:32.800\n And we know very little about the,\n\n1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:34.560\n there's very little reliable information\n\n1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:36.360\n about the training program for wrestling\n\n1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:39.320\n in the Russian States.\n\n1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:43.120\n But one thing is incontestable is the amount of success\n\n1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:45.920\n that they've had in international world championship\n\n1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:47.560\n and Olympic competition.\n\n1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:52.160\n They are disproportionately successful\n\n1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.760\n despite their relatively small numbers.\n\n1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:57.920\n There's nothing genetically special about them.\n\n1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:01.120\n You can talk about performance enhancing drugs,\n\n1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:03.440\n but those are a worldwide phenomenon.\n\n1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:05.080\n They don't have any access to technology\n\n1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:07.040\n that the rest of the world doesn't have.\n\n1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:11.880\n At some point, you gotta start asking,\n\n1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:14.440\n what are they doing differently in the training room?\n\n1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:19.440\n And there are many other examples of similar situations.\n\n1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:24.440\n My country, New Zealand, has an insanely successful\n\n1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:28.920\n rugby program, the sport of rugby,\n\n1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:33.920\n which they have dominated for literally generations\n\n1:19:34.120 --> 1:19:38.040\n despite the fact that our population is very, very small\n\n1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:39.240\n compared with the rest of the country.\n\n1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:41.760\n And we don't excel in many other sports.\n\n1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:45.280\n New Zealand does fairly well in sports overall,\n\n1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.320\n but nothing like they do in rugby.\n\n1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:50.320\n And you've got to ask yourself, is there a culture there\n\n1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:52.160\n which built this up?\n\n1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:57.160\n And the world is full of examples of seemingly small\n\n1:19:57.160 --> 1:19:59.960\n and unpromising areas or locations\n\n1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:02.800\n putting out disproportionately high numbers\n\n1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:05.120\n of successful athletes.\n\n1:20:05.120 --> 1:20:10.120\n And that points to the idea that different training programs\n\n1:20:10.280 --> 1:20:12.320\n have different success rates.\n\n1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:15.720\n And so I truly believe with all my heart and all my soul\n\n1:20:15.720 --> 1:20:20.360\n that how you train does make a significant difference.\n\n1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:21.680\n I would even go further and say\n\n1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:23.120\n it makes the most difference.\n\n1:20:23.120 --> 1:20:24.240\n Is it the only thing?\n\n1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:25.080\n Absolutely not.\n\n1:20:25.080 --> 1:20:26.360\n We've already talked about fortune.\n\n1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:27.760\n We've talked about genetics.\n\n1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:30.880\n If you wanna get nasty, you can even talk about things\n\n1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:32.080\n like performance enhancing drugs\n\n1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:34.280\n that obviously plays a role in modern sports.\n\n1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:41.360\n But I do believe that the majority of what creates success\n\n1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:43.560\n is the interaction between the athlete\n\n1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:45.280\n and the training program.\n\n1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:47.200\n Now, the training program is one thing.\n\n1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:49.240\n I do believe that's the single most important,\n\n1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:52.040\n but right behind it is the athlete themselves.\n\n1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:57.880\n In my own experience, people talk about athletes\n\n1:20:57.880 --> 1:20:59.040\n that I've trained successfully,\n\n1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:00.360\n but they never talk about athletes\n\n1:21:00.360 --> 1:21:01.920\n that I've trained unsuccessfully.\n\n1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:06.360\n Always remember that for every champion coach produces,\n\n1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.080\n there's always going to be a difference.\n\n1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:11.360\n Always remember that for every champion a coach produces,\n\n1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:14.320\n there's a hundred people that they coach\n\n1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:18.840\n that no one ever heard of, and this is completely normal.\n\n1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:24.000\n A coach can never take the lion's share of the credit.\n\n1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.600\n A coach creates possibilities,\n\n1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:31.360\n but it's the athlete who actualizes the possibilities.\n\n1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:35.880\n And so building that rapport and finding the right people\n\n1:21:35.880 --> 1:21:39.360\n to excel in your training program is also a big part of it.\n\n1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:42.280\n What makes the difference between the successful,\n\n1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:45.920\n your successes and your failures as a coach?\n\n1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:47.000\n A range of reasons.\n\n1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:50.760\n The single most important is persistence.\n\n1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:55.320\n People will point to all kinds of virtues amongst athletes.\n\n1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:56.520\n This guy's the most courageous.\n\n1:21:56.520 --> 1:21:58.200\n This guy's the strongest.\n\n1:21:58.200 --> 1:21:59.960\n These are all virtues,\n\n1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:04.960\n but the one indispensable virtue is persistence,\n\n1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:07.440\n the ability just to stay in the game long enough\n\n1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:09.360\n to get the results you seek.\n\n1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:12.640\n But what does persistence really look like?\n\n1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:14.400\n If we can just break that apart a little bit.\n\n1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:17.000\n It's actually, this is a great question you're asking\n\n1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:18.680\n because most people see it\n\n1:22:18.680 --> 1:22:22.000\n as a kind of simplistic doggedness\n\n1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:23.720\n where you just show up every day.\n\n1:22:23.720 --> 1:22:24.760\n That's not it.\n\n1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:27.720\n The most important form of persistence\n\n1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:30.440\n is persistence of thinking,\n\n1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:34.640\n which looks to push you in increasingly efficient,\n\n1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:37.160\n more and more efficient methods of training.\n\n1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.200\n Famously, people talk about the idea\n\n1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:42.680\n that the hardest work of all is hard thinking,\n\n1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:44.440\n and they're absolutely right.\n\n1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:45.640\n Okay, coming into the gym\n\n1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:48.320\n and just doing the same thing for a decade\n\n1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:50.240\n isn't going to make you better.\n\n1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:51.720\n What's going to make you better\n\n1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:53.800\n is progressive training over time\n\n1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.320\n where you identify clear goals marked out\n\n1:22:56.320 --> 1:22:58.880\n in time increments, three months, six months,\n\n1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:00.240\n 12 months, five years,\n\n1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:03.640\n and build those short term goals\n\n1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:05.920\n into a program of long term goals,\n\n1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:10.240\n making sure that the training program changes over time\n\n1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:11.920\n so that as your skill level rises,\n\n1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:13.600\n the challenges you face in the gym\n\n1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:15.160\n become higher and higher.\n\n1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:16.440\n Don't kill them at the start\n\n1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:18.680\n with challenges that are too hard for them\n\n1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:20.880\n to deal with, they get discouraged and leave.\n\n1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:22.720\n Build them slowly over time,\n\n1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:25.240\n but make sure they don't just get left in a swamp\n\n1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:26.480\n where they're just doing the same thing\n\n1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:28.240\n they were doing three years ago and they get bored.\n\n1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:31.320\n And there's two ways you can leave in a gym.\n\n1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:35.240\n You can leave from adversity, it was too tough,\n\n1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:37.400\n or you can leave from boredom.\n\n1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:40.120\n Everyone talks about the first,\n\n1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:41.800\n no one talks about the second.\n\n1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:45.360\n Most people, when they get to black belt,\n\n1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:46.800\n they get bored.\n\n1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:47.960\n They know what their game is,\n\n1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:48.960\n they know what they're good at,\n\n1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:50.560\n they know what they're not good at.\n\n1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:52.720\n When they compete, they stick with what they're good at,\n\n1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:54.680\n and they avoid what they're not good at,\n\n1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:56.160\n and they get bored.\n\n1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:59.440\n They reach a plateau, and that's it.\n\n1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:02.360\n My whole thing is to make sure it's not so tough\n\n1:24:02.360 --> 1:24:05.160\n at the start that they leave because of adversity,\n\n1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:06.400\n and then for the rest of their career\n\n1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:07.680\n to make sure it's not boring\n\n1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:10.080\n so they leave because of boredom.\n\n1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.680\n Travis Stevens actually said something\n\n1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:13.800\n that changed the way I see training.\n\n1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:15.520\n He said it as a side comment,\n\n1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:19.920\n but he said that at the end of a good training session,\n\n1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:22.440\n your mind should be exhausted, not your body.\n\n1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:27.440\n And I've, for most of my life,\n\n1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:31.280\n saw good training sessions where my body was exhausted.\n\n1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.120\n Yes, I believe that's the case with most people.\n\n1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.080\n You should come out of the training session\n\n1:24:37.080 --> 1:24:39.240\n with your mind buzzing with ideas,\n\n1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:41.480\n like possibilities for tomorrow.\n\n1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:42.880\n And by the way, on that note,\n\n1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:45.440\n I would go further and say that the training session\n\n1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:48.640\n doesn't finish when your body stops moving.\n\n1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:51.160\n It finishes when your mind stops moving,\n\n1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:53.160\n and your mind shouldn't stop moving.\n\n1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:55.080\n After that session, there should be analysis.\n\n1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:55.920\n What did I do well?\n\n1:24:55.920 --> 1:24:57.240\n What did I do badly?\n\n1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:00.200\n How could I do better with the things that I did well?\n\n1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:03.600\n Can I ask you about something that I truly enjoy\n\n1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.640\n and I think is really powerful,\n\n1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:07.600\n but most people don't seem to believe in that,\n\n1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:08.680\n but is drilling?\n\n1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:11.520\n I don't know.\n\n1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.360\n Maybe people are different, but I love the idea,\n\n1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:16.840\n maybe even outside of jiu jitsu,\n\n1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.400\n of doing the same thing over and over.\n\n1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:21.680\n It's like Jiro dreams of sushi.\n\n1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:26.680\n I love doing the thing that nobody wants to do\n\n1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:30.680\n and doing it 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 times\n\n1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:32.840\n more than what nobody wants to do.\n\n1:25:34.200 --> 1:25:36.840\n So I'm a huge fan of drilling.\n\n1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:38.680\n Obviously, I'm not a professional athlete,\n\n1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:41.160\n but I feel like if I actually gave myself,\n\n1:25:42.360 --> 1:25:44.400\n if I wanted to be really good at jiu jitsu,\n\n1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:47.480\n like reach the level of being in the top 25\n\n1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.280\n when I was much younger, like really strive,\n\n1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:55.800\n I think I could achieve it by drilling.\n\n1:25:56.840 --> 1:25:59.080\n I had this belief untested.\n\n1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:03.280\n Can you challenge this idea or agree with it?\n\n1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:05.360\n First off, fascinating.\n\n1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.000\n However, we're going to have to disagree.\n\n1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:08.840\n No, no.\n\n1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:13.240\n We're just gonna have to start to understand\n\n1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:15.560\n what are we talking about when we talk about drilling?\n\n1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:17.600\n It's a very vague term.\n\n1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:22.600\n Okay, at this moment, many of your listeners\n\n1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:25.000\n are probably having the same thought process,\n\n1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.200\n which is, oh, drilling.\n\n1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:27.880\n Yeah, I know what that is.\n\n1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:30.600\n We go into the gym and we pick a move\n\n1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.360\n and we practice it for a certain number of repetitions.\n\n1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:38.240\n And if I do that, I'm gonna get better at the technique.\n\n1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:43.240\n Okay, they're wrong.\n\n1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:51.240\n We've got to have a much more in depth understanding\n\n1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:54.760\n of what the hell we're talking about\n\n1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:56.200\n when we talk about drilling.\n\n1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:02.480\n Ultimately, any movement in the gym\n\n1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:07.480\n that doesn't improve the skills you already have\n\n1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:10.520\n or build new skills is a waste of time,\n\n1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:13.160\n a waste of resources.\n\n1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:16.120\n Everything you do should be done with the aim\n\n1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.960\n and the understanding that this is gonna make me better\n\n1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.600\n at the sport I practice.\n\n1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:22.360\n If it's not, shouldn't be there.\n\n1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:27.320\n The majority of what passes for drilling\n\n1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:32.640\n in most training halls will not make you better,\n\n1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:35.920\n including some of the most cherished forms of drilling,\n\n1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:40.000\n which is repetition for numbers.\n\n1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:42.440\n The moment you say to someone,\n\n1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:44.440\n I want you to do this a hundred times,\n\n1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:47.920\n what are they really thinking about?\n\n1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:48.760\n Volume.\n\n1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.240\n They're saying, okay, I'm at repetition 78.\n\n1:27:53.400 --> 1:27:55.400\n I'm at 80, 20 more to go.\n\n1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.720\n All they're talking, their primary thought process\n\n1:27:58.720 --> 1:27:59.680\n is on numbers.\n\n1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:03.240\n That's not the point of drilling.\n\n1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:05.160\n The point is skill acquisition.\n\n1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:09.680\n When people drill, don't get them focused on numbers,\n\n1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:12.440\n get them focused on mechanics.\n\n1:28:12.440 --> 1:28:14.240\n That's what they have to worry about.\n\n1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:17.800\n I never have my students drill for numbers ever.\n\n1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:20.320\n Just one, two, three, get the fuck out of here.\n\n1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:21.880\n Are you kidding me?\n\n1:28:21.880 --> 1:28:23.600\n Like how are you gonna get better with that?\n\n1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:28.200\n Okay, get them working on the sense of gaining knowledge.\n\n1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:30.080\n That's my job.\n\n1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:31.640\n I have to give them knowledge.\n\n1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:34.160\n I have to explain to them what they're trying to do.\n\n1:28:34.160 --> 1:28:36.840\n That starts them on the right track.\n\n1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:38.960\n But knowledge is one thing.\n\n1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:41.280\n Skill is another.\n\n1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.000\n If jiu jitsu was just about knowledge,\n\n1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:48.000\n then all the 60 and 70 year old red belts\n\n1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.200\n would be the world champions.\n\n1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:50.480\n They're not.\n\n1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:53.840\n Jiu jitsu isn't won by knowledge, it's won by skill.\n\n1:28:53.840 --> 1:28:58.160\n Knowledge is the first step in building skill.\n\n1:28:58.160 --> 1:29:01.960\n So my job as a coach is to transmit knowledge.\n\n1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.680\n Then I have to create training programs\n\n1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:08.440\n with a path from knowledge to polished skill\n\n1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:11.240\n is carried out.\n\n1:29:11.240 --> 1:29:13.760\n That's the interface between me and my students.\n\n1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:18.760\n And so I give them drills where the whole emphasis\n\n1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:23.680\n is upon getting a sense where they understand\n\n1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:26.520\n what are the problems they're trying to solve\n\n1:29:26.520 --> 1:29:30.520\n and working towards practical solutions.\n\n1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:32.760\n They never work with numbers.\n\n1:29:32.760 --> 1:29:36.040\n They work with mechanics and feel.\n\n1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:39.200\n Then you have to bring in the idea of progression.\n\n1:29:41.480 --> 1:29:44.800\n When you drill, there's zero resistance.\n\n1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:48.920\n When you fight in competition, there's 100% resistance.\n\n1:29:48.920 --> 1:29:51.240\n You can't go from zero to 100.\n\n1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:54.960\n There has to be progress over time\n\n1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:59.160\n where I have them work in drills\n\n1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:04.160\n with slightly increasing increments of resistance.\n\n1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:06.640\n And just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter\n\n1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:08.840\n who doesn't start with 500 pounds,\n\n1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:11.960\n but who begins with the bar and then over time\n\n1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:14.680\n builds the skills that one day out there in the future\n\n1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:16.720\n he will lift 500 pounds.\n\n1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:19.880\n So too, that Jujikutami that you're working on today\n\n1:30:19.880 --> 1:30:22.720\n is feeble and pathetic, but five years from now\n\n1:30:22.720 --> 1:30:24.680\n you'll win a world championship with it.\n\n1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:28.600\n You can't have this naive idea of drilling.\n\n1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:30.320\n It's something you just come out,\n\n1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.760\n you randomly pick a move and you work for numbers\n\n1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:36.720\n until you've satisfied a certain set of numbers\n\n1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:37.720\n that your coach threw at you\n\n1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:39.720\n and then think you're gonna get better.\n\n1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:45.960\n There's even dangers with drilling.\n\n1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:50.960\n There is no performance increase that comes\n\n1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:54.440\n once you get to a certain level\n\n1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:57.200\n and you just keep doing the same damn thing.\n\n1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:01.640\n Let's say, for example, you come out\n\n1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:04.880\n and you hit a hundred repetitions of the arm\n\n1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:06.720\n by Jujikutami from guard position.\n\n1:31:06.720 --> 1:31:07.840\n And you're all proud of yourself\n\n1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:09.120\n because you hit a hundred repetitions\n\n1:31:09.120 --> 1:31:11.040\n and your body's tired and you're telling yourself,\n\n1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:12.880\n man, I got a good workout.\n\n1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:16.320\n And you come in tomorrow, you do exactly the same thing.\n\n1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:18.400\n You come in the day after that and a week goes by\n\n1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:19.880\n and you've done the same thing.\n\n1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:23.320\n Then a year later, you do the same thing.\n\n1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:28.800\n Ask yourself, has your Jujikutami really gotten better?\n\n1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:32.480\n No, you've performed literally thousands\n\n1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:34.280\n and thousands of repetitions.\n\n1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:38.280\n You've spent an enormous amount of training time\n\n1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:40.800\n and energy that could have gone in different directions\n\n1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:43.320\n on something which didn't make you any better.\n\n1:31:45.560 --> 1:31:49.640\n Drills have diminishing returns.\n\n1:31:49.640 --> 1:31:51.760\n Once you get to a certain skill level,\n\n1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:54.800\n if you just keep hammering on the same thing\n\n1:31:54.800 --> 1:31:58.840\n in the same fashion for the same amount of time,\n\n1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:01.000\n you stop getting better.\n\n1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:04.360\n Can I, partially for fun, partially for Dallas Advocate,\n\n1:32:04.360 --> 1:32:05.840\n but partially because I actually believe this\n\n1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:10.240\n to push back on some points, is it possible?\n\n1:32:10.240 --> 1:32:13.800\n So everything you said, I think is beautiful and correct.\n\n1:32:13.800 --> 1:32:18.800\n But the asking yourself the question, am I getting better?\n\n1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:19.640\n It's a really important one\n\n1:32:19.640 --> 1:32:21.480\n and you could do that in training.\n\n1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:23.320\n Is there a set of techniques,\n\n1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:26.320\n maybe a small subset of all the techniques\n\n1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:27.920\n that are in Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:32.920\n where you can have significant skill acquisition\n\n1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:37.440\n if you put in the numbers or the time, whatever,\n\n1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:40.680\n on a technique against an opponent who's not resisting?\n\n1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:43.600\n Here's, let me elaborate.\n\n1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:45.600\n What I've, in my, maybe I'm different.\n\n1:32:45.600 --> 1:32:47.200\n You'll probably have to finish an example.\n\n1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:48.040\n Yes.\n\n1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:51.320\n Let me first make a general statement\n\n1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:53.080\n and then I can give examples.\n\n1:32:53.080 --> 1:32:56.680\n The general statement is I found that through repetitions,\n\n1:32:56.680 --> 1:33:00.680\n and this is high repetitions combined with training,\n\n1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:03.920\n but high repetitions against a non resisting opponent,\n\n1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:08.920\n I've gotten to understand the way my body moves,\n\n1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:11.600\n the way I apply pressure on a human.\n\n1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:13.320\n Because it's not actually zero resistance.\n\n1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:14.920\n The opponent's still laying there.\n\n1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:16.840\n They're still keeping their legs up.\n\n1:33:16.840 --> 1:33:19.400\n They're still doing, they might not be resisting,\n\n1:33:19.400 --> 1:33:21.520\n but they're still creating a structure.\n\n1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:22.360\n Yes.\n\n1:33:22.360 --> 1:33:23.520\n A non dynamic structure.\n\n1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:24.880\n They're presenting a target.\n\n1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:25.720\n Yes.\n\n1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.920\n But it's not dynamic.\n\n1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:31.960\n So you can't master the timing of things,\n\n1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:34.760\n but you can master the, not master,\n\n1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:37.760\n but I felt like I could gain an understanding\n\n1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:40.040\n of how to apply pressure to the human body\n\n1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:43.160\n over thousands of repetitions.\n\n1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:45.360\n Now, for example, I just, just to give you an example\n\n1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:48.000\n to know what we're talking about.\n\n1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.160\n There's a guy named Saulo Herbaro and Shanji Herbaro\n\n1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:55.160\n that have this, I guess, I already forgot,\n\n1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:57.560\n but the headquarters position or something like that.\n\n1:33:57.560 --> 1:34:00.960\n But putting pressure as you pass guard,\n\n1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:03.440\n like medium passing distance kind of pressure.\n\n1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:06.960\n I've did thousands of repetitions of that\n\n1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:11.960\n to understand what putting pressure with my hips feels like.\n\n1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:13.920\n To truly understand that movement,\n\n1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:17.560\n I felt like I was getting much better.\n\n1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:19.440\n It's like, it's hard to put into words,\n\n1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:22.680\n but that skill acquisition is so subtle.\n\n1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:25.440\n Just the way you turn your hips.\n\n1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:27.160\n But you're already talking about\n\n1:34:27.160 --> 1:34:28.480\n a better form of drilling now.\n\n1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:30.480\n You're going beyond the basic numbers\n\n1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:32.440\n and you're getting the sense of feel and mechanics,\n\n1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:33.960\n which is what we want in drilling.\n\n1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:36.080\n But the reason I say numbers,\n\n1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:37.440\n and maybe you can speak to this,\n\n1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:39.760\n but this might be an OCD thing,\n\n1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:43.280\n but it allows you to take a journey\n\n1:34:43.280 --> 1:34:46.280\n that doesn't just last a week or two weeks,\n\n1:34:46.280 --> 1:34:48.960\n but a journey where you stay with the technique\n\n1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:50.640\n for two, three years.\n\n1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:53.760\n And there's a dedication to it.\n\n1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:57.040\n Where it's a long term commitment\n\n1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:59.000\n to where you're forcing yourself,\n\n1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.400\n perhaps there's other mechanisms,\n\n1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:03.280\n but you're forcing yourself to stay with a technique\n\n1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:05.000\n longer than most people around you\n\n1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.120\n are staying with whatever they're working on.\n\n1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:09.120\n And you're taking that long journey.\n\n1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:12.360\n And the numbers somehow enforce that persistence\n\n1:35:12.360 --> 1:35:13.480\n and that dedication.\n\n1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:18.320\n First thing, that journey's a wonderful thing.\n\n1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:23.000\n And if that technique is a crucial part of what you do,\n\n1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.760\n then it's time well invested.\n\n1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:25.600\n But always understand\n\n1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.560\n that it comes at an opportunity cost.\n\n1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:30.400\n That by spending that amount of time on that one technique,\n\n1:35:30.400 --> 1:35:31.720\n you've sacrificed other things\n\n1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:35.000\n that you could have learned that could have won you matches.\n\n1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.000\n So understand that every focus upon one element of the game\n\n1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:43.240\n comes at the opportunity cost of other elements.\n\n1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:46.640\n Now, as long as you're playing a part of the game\n\n1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.720\n where, okay, this is central to what I do.\n\n1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:50.760\n Yes, okay, that's fine.\n\n1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:53.720\n But just be aware of the danger of opportunity cost.\n\n1:35:53.720 --> 1:35:55.480\n That's something no one talks about in the training room,\n\n1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:57.560\n but it becomes very important.\n\n1:35:57.560 --> 1:35:59.080\n Secondly, the other question you have to start\n\n1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:01.320\n asking yourself is, okay,\n\n1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:05.880\n that training clearly had benefits for you early on.\n\n1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.640\n But when the point of diminishing return starts coming\n\n1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:11.120\n and if you feel you're just doing the same thing,\n\n1:36:11.120 --> 1:36:12.320\n then it's time to switch.\n\n1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:15.360\n Now, if you feel you're still getting benefit from it,\n\n1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:17.320\n by all means, continue.\n\n1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:18.960\n That will be a call on your part.\n\n1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:21.560\n You've been playing this game a long time now,\n\n1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:23.320\n so I would trust your call on that.\n\n1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:28.600\n But my job as a coach is to look out and say,\n\n1:36:28.600 --> 1:36:30.240\n okay, this kid's been working\n\n1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:34.600\n cross Ashigarami for six months\n\n1:36:34.600 --> 1:36:37.240\n and I feel he's gotten to a good skill level.\n\n1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:40.080\n If he stays any further on it,\n\n1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:43.000\n the opportunity cost becomes greater\n\n1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.840\n than the expected benefits of continuing it.\n\n1:36:45.840 --> 1:36:47.040\n And that's my job as a coach,\n\n1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:48.520\n is to direct things in that fashion.\n\n1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.320\n If I can do a good job with that,\n\n1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:52.760\n then I can take them to the next level of drilling\n\n1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.360\n and start amping it up.\n\n1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.760\n And that's how I keep progress over time.\n\n1:36:56.760 --> 1:36:59.880\n My biggest fear is to have students\n\n1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:03.560\n run past the point of diminishing returns,\n\n1:37:03.560 --> 1:37:07.920\n staying stagnant where opportunity costs comes in\n\n1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:10.600\n and they're not making the progress they could\n\n1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:13.240\n in the time that they've been working.\n\n1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:14.080\n I mean, that was,\n\n1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:16.320\n it was almost a philosophical question for me.\n\n1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:18.080\n That's what I was always on a search on\n\n1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:22.520\n because I know my mind is likes drilling.\n\n1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:26.560\n I don't like relying on other people for improvement\n\n1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:30.640\n and drilling allows me to do something\n\n1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:33.680\n that is 100% me.\n\n1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:34.520\n It's interesting Lex,\n\n1:37:34.520 --> 1:37:36.320\n you say you don't like relying on other people in drilling,\n\n1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:39.280\n but in drilling, you really do rely a lot on your partner.\n\n1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:40.960\n One of the first things I do when I coach people\n\n1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:43.280\n is I teach them how to drill.\n\n1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:44.920\n That's a skill in itself.\n\n1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:49.520\n And drilling is in a sense,\n\n1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:53.280\n the opposite of sparring.\n\n1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:55.800\n Drilling is a cooperative venture\n\n1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.480\n where you work as dance partners,\n\n1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:00.280\n complimenting each other's movement.\n\n1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:04.280\n If I drill with Gordon Ryan and I want him to work on bars,\n\n1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:05.920\n I will move my body in ways\n\n1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:09.560\n which make it an interesting exercise for Gordon.\n\n1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:15.560\n I'm not just sitting there and he does a repetition\n\n1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:17.720\n and I'm, okay, he does 10.\n\n1:38:18.760 --> 1:38:20.880\n I can't wait for this to be over so I can do my 10\n\n1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.240\n and I can't wait for all this to be over\n\n1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.600\n so we can just spar and get over all this bullshit.\n\n1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:28.480\n That's the sad truth of most drilling in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:33.360\n There's a sense in which when good people drill,\n\n1:38:33.360 --> 1:38:36.920\n it's like watching good people dance.\n\n1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:39.800\n They move in unison and compliment each other's movement\n\n1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:42.200\n and make each other look better.\n\n1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.480\n Sparring, on the other hand, is the exact opposite of that.\n\n1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:46.160\n That's resistance where you're trying to make\n\n1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:48.320\n the other person look as bad as possible.\n\n1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:51.080\n And once you understand the different directions\n\n1:38:51.080 --> 1:38:52.800\n in which drilling and sparring go,\n\n1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:54.360\n that's when things start getting interesting.\n\n1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:56.560\n You start getting fast progress.\n\n1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:59.000\n Yeah, you're absolutely right.\n\n1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.240\n I think I was not very eloquent describing what I mean.\n\n1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:07.240\n I found myself not able to find in Jiu Jitsu\n\n1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:09.920\n too many people that are willing to dedicate\n\n1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:12.920\n a huge amount of time to a particular technique.\n\n1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:15.000\n I concur with you on Netflix.\n\n1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.160\n Now, answer the interesting question, why?\n\n1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:21.920\n Why can't you get people to drill with you?\n\n1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:24.160\n By the way, if I could just shout out\n\n1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:25.720\n the people that did drill with me\n\n1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:30.720\n is usually blue belt women because they're smaller,\n\n1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:34.520\n they don't like training because they get their ass kicked\n\n1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.080\n because they're much smaller.\n\n1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:40.960\n So they're willing to invest a significant amount of effort\n\n1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.160\n into training.\n\n1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:49.080\n That's good, but their motivation for doing so is not good.\n\n1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:49.920\n Well, yes.\n\n1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.480\n But your motivation for drilling is\n\n1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:52.640\n because you don't want to get your ass kicked.\n\n1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:55.400\n That's not a good motivation. No black belt ever.\n\n1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:57.040\n I could never find a black belt\n\n1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:59.400\n that I could drill with like this.\n\n1:39:59.400 --> 1:40:01.520\n Now let's go back to that question, why?\n\n1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:05.080\n I don't mean this, I am somebody\n\n1:40:05.080 --> 1:40:06.920\n who likes to say nice things about people.\n\n1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:08.920\n So let me answer for you.\n\n1:40:08.920 --> 1:40:09.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:09.800 --> 1:40:12.520\n Two reasons, because they find it boring.\n\n1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:13.360\n Yes.\n\n1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:14.880\n And secondly, perhaps more importantly,\n\n1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:16.520\n they don't believe it works.\n\n1:40:16.520 --> 1:40:18.320\n Yeah, those are good answers.\n\n1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:20.080\n And now let's go further\n\n1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.640\n and ask the truly interesting question.\n\n1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:23.920\n Why do they believe that?\n\n1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.920\n If I were to answer it in the context of Russian wrestling,\n\n1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:32.480\n where drilling is much bigger part,\n\n1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:35.560\n is I think culturally that was knowledge\n\n1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:38.200\n that everybody tells each other in Jiu Jitsu\n\n1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.200\n that drilling doesn't work.\n\n1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:47.520\n Because they never taught how to drill.\n\n1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:49.040\n No one ever sits you down one day and says,\n\n1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:50.760\n okay, this is how you drill.\n\n1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:54.240\n And so the exercise feels futile.\n\n1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:55.840\n They don't feel their skill level is going up.\n\n1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:59.000\n They don't associate drilling with increased skill level.\n\n1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.680\n They associate sparring with increased skill level,\n\n1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:03.760\n but not drilling, which is a tragedy\n\n1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:08.000\n because it is a fantastic way to introduce\n\n1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.360\n and expand the repertoire of a developing student.\n\n1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.760\n It's an essential part of every workout I teach.\n\n1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:17.760\n I always say the game of Jiu Jitsu begins with knowledge\n\n1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:20.400\n and builds up to skill.\n\n1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:23.120\n Who wins is the one who has greater skill\n\n1:41:23.120 --> 1:41:24.880\n and nine times out of 10.\n\n1:41:25.920 --> 1:41:28.960\n So to me, it's a tragedy that what you're saying\n\n1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:31.200\n breaks my heart to hear that you couldn't get a black belt\n\n1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:33.400\n to drill with you, that's shameful.\n\n1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:38.280\n But I understand, I sympathize with those black belts too\n\n1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:41.640\n because the way in which most people are told to drill\n\n1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:44.920\n does feel ineffective and it is damn boring.\n\n1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:46.400\n They'd rather just spar.\n\n1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:48.480\n They feel like they get more out of the workout.\n\n1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:51.760\n And that's, if anything, an indictment\n\n1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:54.640\n upon most of the training programs around the nation.\n\n1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:56.840\n Would you say that drilling,\n\n1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:01.520\n if you were to build a black belt world champion,\n\n1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:05.760\n would drilling be, what percent of their training,\n\n1:42:05.760 --> 1:42:08.480\n in the entirety of their career would be drilling?\n\n1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:09.480\n Great question.\n\n1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:11.840\n Let's first put a proviso on it\n\n1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:14.160\n that I don't do the same thing for all athletes.\n\n1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:16.200\n Everyone's got a different personality.\n\n1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:19.560\n And like Nicky Rod, I can only hold his attention\n\n1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:20.880\n for two minutes at a time.\n\n1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:25.880\n And Gary Tonin, five minutes.\n\n1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:28.320\n Gordon Ryan, five hours.\n\n1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:31.640\n Like George St. Pierre, five hours.\n\n1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.040\n Travis Stevens, five hours.\n\n1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:35.400\n They are just laser focused.\n\n1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:36.320\n So everyone's different.\n\n1:42:36.320 --> 1:42:38.480\n Let's put that down as our first proviso.\n\n1:42:40.680 --> 1:42:42.160\n You probably knew those answers already.\n\n1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:43.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:45.160\n That's hilarious.\n\n1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:49.280\n But as a general rule,\n\n1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:51.920\n if I run a two and a half hour class,\n\n1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:56.120\n you can expect an hour and a half of it to be,\n\n1:42:57.640 --> 1:42:59.160\n I'm going to use the word drilling,\n\n1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:01.600\n but I'm also going to say that this is too complex\n\n1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:03.920\n of a story to give now with words.\n\n1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:05.280\n I would need to demonstrate it.\n\n1:43:05.280 --> 1:43:06.600\n But the way in which we drill\n\n1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:08.360\n is not your standard method of drilling.\n\n1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:09.840\n And then it's into sparring.\n\n1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:12.720\n But if you give me a choice\n\n1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:15.400\n between a bad drilling partner and sparring,\n\n1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:19.440\n I could make the same choice that most black belts make,\n\n1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:21.160\n which I would go with sparring.\n\n1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:22.800\n Because you can create drilling\n\n1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:24.880\n within the sparring environment.\n\n1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:28.360\n Like good drilling is a wonderful thing.\n\n1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.760\n Bad drilling is just a worthless waste of time.\n\n1:43:33.560 --> 1:43:36.040\n Okay, before, I have a million questions for you,\n\n1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:37.200\n but I have to ask,\n\n1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.040\n can you, we've described the fundamentals of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:44.480\n Can we describe the principles, the fundamentals\n\n1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:46.760\n of one of the interesting systems you've developed,\n\n1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:49.200\n which is the leg lock system?\n\n1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:50.960\n Yeah, anything in particular\n\n1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:53.280\n or just like a general understanding\n\n1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:55.840\n of what are some of the major principles of it?\n\n1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:59.640\n Well, it's like me coming to Miyamoto Musashi and asking,\n\n1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:03.920\n can you describe the principles of sword fighting?\n\n1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:04.920\n You're too generous.\n\n1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.480\n Let's start off with some context.\n\n1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:13.480\n When I began the sport of jiu jitsu,\n\n1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:18.480\n I was taught a fairly classical approach to jiu jitsu,\n\n1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:23.200\n which leg locks were a part of it,\n\n1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:25.040\n but not an emphasized part of it.\n\n1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:30.160\n The overall culture of the times is the mid 1990s.\n\n1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:34.160\n The overall culture of the time saw leg locks\n\n1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:39.160\n as largely ineffective.\n\n1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:44.840\n It was, we were told that against good opposition,\n\n1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:46.000\n they just didn't work very well.\n\n1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.160\n They were low percentage techniques.\n\n1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:52.400\n We were also told that they were tactically unsound\n\n1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:54.440\n because if you ever attempted them\n\n1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:56.480\n and you lost control of the leg lock,\n\n1:44:58.160 --> 1:44:59.640\n your opponent would end up on top of you\n\n1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:01.280\n or in some kind of good position\n\n1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:04.400\n and you'd be in terrible trouble.\n\n1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:06.680\n And we were also told that they were unsafe,\n\n1:45:06.680 --> 1:45:09.640\n that if they were applied in the gym,\n\n1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:10.840\n there'd be far too many injuries\n\n1:45:10.840 --> 1:45:12.440\n and people would be badly hurt.\n\n1:45:13.320 --> 1:45:16.920\n And that was the received wisdom of that time.\n\n1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.160\n And so I didn't even work with them at all.\n\n1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:24.360\n And they would be shown occasionally in the gym\n\n1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:26.880\n and you'd learn them, you'd drill them.\n\n1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:31.240\n But in sparring, I showed no interest.\n\n1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:35.600\n You probably know that change when I met\n\n1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.200\n the great American grappler, Dean Lister,\n\n1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:41.440\n who early in his career was using Achilles locks\n\n1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:42.920\n with considerable success.\n\n1:45:42.920 --> 1:45:45.240\n I met him in the gym, wonderful fellow.\n\n1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:46.320\n And...\n\n1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:48.120\n Achilles locks is like a straight full lock.\n\n1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:49.720\n Yes, that's correct, yes.\n\n1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:53.560\n And he went on to become a heel hooker\n\n1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:56.440\n and win 280 CCs later on in his career.\n\n1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:59.200\n But we never met again after that.\n\n1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:04.200\n And that opened some doors of inquiry and...\n\n1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:09.160\n Well, he asked this first principles question\n\n1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:13.360\n is why would you only use half the body in a game\n\n1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:14.720\n that involves the human body?\n\n1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:15.760\n Perfect sense.\n\n1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:18.760\n So that opened doors to inquiry.\n\n1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:22.640\n And if you looked around the Jiu Jitsu world at that time,\n\n1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.640\n the number of specialized leg lockers was very small.\n\n1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:32.920\n And most of them were from outside of conventional Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:35.880\n For example, you could look around and see people\n\n1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:39.440\n like Romina Sato had sharp leg locks\n\n1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:41.480\n for that time period in the 1990s.\n\n1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:45.120\n So they were out there, they existed.\n\n1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.280\n And you'd see people like Ken Shamrock\n\n1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:50.240\n would use heel hooks in competition\n\n1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:52.920\n and he had some good success with them.\n\n1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:57.720\n When I began experimenting in the gym,\n\n1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:03.960\n fairly soon, certain truths started to become evident.\n\n1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:07.800\n And the most important of these\n\n1:47:07.800 --> 1:47:09.160\n can be understood very quickly.\n\n1:47:09.160 --> 1:47:11.640\n And they were relatively easy to discover.\n\n1:47:13.160 --> 1:47:17.440\n The first was that most people,\n\n1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:22.440\n when they went to understand and study leg locking.\n\n1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:26.000\n And when I talk about leg locking,\n\n1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:27.640\n I'm gonna talk about one specific type,\n\n1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:29.800\n which is the most high percentage type.\n\n1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:31.800\n This is leg locks, which are performed\n\n1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:35.000\n with entanglements of your opponent's legs with your legs.\n\n1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:36.320\n There are other forms of leg lock,\n\n1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:38.120\n but these are relatively low percentage\n\n1:47:38.120 --> 1:47:39.840\n and don't figure heavily in competition.\n\n1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:41.360\n So I'll ignore them.\n\n1:47:43.360 --> 1:47:45.920\n Most people made no distinction\n\n1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:48.680\n between the mechanism of control\n\n1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:51.760\n versus the mechanism of breaking.\n\n1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:56.720\n The heel hook is what ultimately breaks the ankle.\n\n1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.120\n But the mechanism of control\n\n1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:01.720\n is the entanglement of your legs to your opponent's legs.\n\n1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:03.880\n The Japanese term ashigurami\n\n1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.920\n literally just means like leg entanglement.\n\n1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:06.880\n It's a generic term.\n\n1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:08.880\n It could apply to any form of entanglement.\n\n1:48:08.880 --> 1:48:10.360\n There are many options.\n\n1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:15.360\n My idea was let's focus on the entanglement first\n\n1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:19.840\n and worry about the breaking mechanism second.\n\n1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:23.600\n This was analogous to the idea of position before submission.\n\n1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:25.080\n Only you couldn't talk about it\n\n1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:27.240\n in terms of conventional positions\n\n1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:29.800\n because ashigurami doesn't really fit\n\n1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:31.920\n into the traditional hierarchies,\n\n1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:33.880\n positional hierarchies of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:38.400\n So the conversation was switched from position to submission\n\n1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:40.960\n to control to submission.\n\n1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:44.040\n Now, wrapping two of your legs\n\n1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:45.640\n around one of your opponent's legs\n\n1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.880\n gives you many different options.\n\n1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:48.840\n You can do it with your feet on the outside,\n\n1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.600\n so called 50, 50 variations.\n\n1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:52.240\n You can do it with your feet on the inside\n\n1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:57.240\n and form what we call inside foot position.\n\n1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:00.320\n There's pros and cons to both.\n\n1:49:00.320 --> 1:49:03.040\n There's also methods of harmonizing the two.\n\n1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:04.280\n So you have one foot on the inside\n\n1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:05.760\n and one foot on the outside.\n\n1:49:05.760 --> 1:49:09.720\n You can do it with a straight leg\n\n1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:11.720\n where you heel hook from the outside\n\n1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:13.560\n or you can bring the leg across your center line\n\n1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:15.520\n and heel hook from the inside.\n\n1:49:15.520 --> 1:49:18.000\n You will start to notice\n\n1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.440\n as you work through these different variations\n\n1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:24.360\n that some present advantages over others.\n\n1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:29.360\n All of them come at a price to some degree,\n\n1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:32.120\n regardless of which ashigurami option you use.\n\n1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:34.720\n There will be some degree of foot exposure\n\n1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:36.440\n on my part to my opponent\n\n1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:38.680\n and some degree of back exposure\n\n1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:40.520\n on my part relative to my opponent.\n\n1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:42.800\n So that's the downside of it.\n\n1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:46.800\n Variations within those different ashigurami\n\n1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:51.000\n enable you to lessen danger in some respects\n\n1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.960\n and at the price of gaining dangers in others.\n\n1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.520\n So you get this wide array of choices.\n\n1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:01.040\n There's not this kind of simplistic hierarchy\n\n1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:03.720\n that you see in the basic position.\n\n1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:05.480\n The basic positions of jiu jitsu,\n\n1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:07.400\n but there are hierarchies.\n\n1:50:07.400 --> 1:50:10.800\n I do, for example, generally favor inside heel hooks\n\n1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:12.160\n over outside heel hooks.\n\n1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:18.800\n If I feel my opponent is very good at exposing my back\n\n1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:20.240\n while I'm in ashigurami,\n\n1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:23.080\n I generally prefer 50, 50 situations.\n\n1:50:23.080 --> 1:50:25.880\n If I believe my opponent is very good at counter leg locks,\n\n1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:28.400\n I generally prefer my feet on the inside\n\n1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:31.320\n working with variations of insides and kaku,\n\n1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:32.360\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:35.160\n So there are broad heuristic rules\n\n1:50:35.160 --> 1:50:37.920\n that we can give to work in these situations.\n\n1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:43.640\n Once you start to understand\n\n1:50:43.640 --> 1:50:48.000\n there's a variety of entanglements you can use,\n\n1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.920\n then you start getting into the really interesting ideas\n\n1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:55.920\n that as you perform one given attack, one given heel hook,\n\n1:50:56.600 --> 1:51:01.320\n you can flow through different forms of ashigurami\n\n1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:04.760\n where you can create new dangers\n\n1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:09.760\n and avoid possible pitfalls in a very short timeframe\n\n1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:14.520\n as you switch from one ashigurami to another over time.\n\n1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.760\n So that as your opponent's lines of resistance\n\n1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:18.720\n to an initial attack change,\n\n1:51:18.720 --> 1:51:19.920\n you can accommodate those\n\n1:51:19.920 --> 1:51:22.320\n by switching to another form of ashigurami\n\n1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:24.680\n so that your mechanism of control\n\n1:51:24.680 --> 1:51:28.080\n is always pointing in opposite directions of his escape.\n\n1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:32.920\n And if you focus on this idea of control through the legs,\n\n1:51:32.920 --> 1:51:36.760\n you can completely change the nature of leg locking\n\n1:51:36.760 --> 1:51:39.760\n and take it away from what it was in the 1990s\n\n1:51:39.760 --> 1:51:42.040\n an opportunistic method of attack\n\n1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:45.120\n based upon surprise, speed and power\n\n1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:47.560\n into one based on control.\n\n1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:48.840\n If you can do this,\n\n1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:54.840\n you can undermine many of the basic criticisms\n\n1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:57.840\n of leg locking which were prevalent when I began.\n\n1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:01.320\n I began the sport of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:06.320\n For example, if I can completely control and immobilize you,\n\n1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:10.040\n I can perform the lock very, very safely.\n\n1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:11.800\n If my only way of breaking your leg\n\n1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:14.840\n is to be faster and more powerful than you,\n\n1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:16.440\n nine times out of 10 when I apply it,\n\n1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:19.960\n I'm gonna hurt your leg as much by accident as anything.\n\n1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:22.040\n But if I can completely immobilize you\n\n1:52:22.040 --> 1:52:24.040\n and as every attempt you make to escape,\n\n1:52:24.040 --> 1:52:28.000\n I can follow you and immobilize you in new directions,\n\n1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:31.560\n then I can apply the lock with as much force\n\n1:52:31.560 --> 1:52:33.880\n or as little force as possible.\n\n1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:35.680\n And so you'll see in our training room\n\n1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:40.400\n despite over considerably more than two decades,\n\n1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:42.160\n sorry, a decade and a half now\n\n1:52:42.160 --> 1:52:44.360\n of heel hooking using these methods,\n\n1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:50.680\n the number of people severely injured by heel hooks is tiny.\n\n1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:55.680\n I would say I've seen more people injured by far\n\n1:52:55.680 --> 1:52:58.680\n by kimuras in the time I've been training\n\n1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:00.040\n than I have by heel hooks,\n\n1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:04.200\n despite them having a similar twisting dynamic to them.\n\n1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:09.840\n If you build a culture where people focus on control\n\n1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.920\n rather than speed of execution,\n\n1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:15.080\n then the injury rate goes down appreciably.\n\n1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:16.920\n The whole idea of positional loss,\n\n1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:18.600\n everyone was critical of leg locks.\n\n1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:20.280\n Now, if you go for leg locks and they don't work,\n\n1:53:20.280 --> 1:53:21.880\n well, now you're in trouble.\n\n1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:23.360\n The guy's gonna be on top of you.\n\n1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:25.560\n They never make that criticism with armbars.\n\n1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:27.760\n Okay, you can be in the mounted position,\n\n1:53:27.760 --> 1:53:29.360\n go for an armbar, end up on bottom,\n\n1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:30.800\n lose the armbar and lose position,\n\n1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:33.160\n but I've never heard anyone criticize armbars\n\n1:53:33.160 --> 1:53:34.320\n on that account.\n\n1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:38.440\n More importantly, I believed from early on\n\n1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:41.600\n that the best place to attack leg locks is not top position,\n\n1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:43.040\n it's bottom position.\n\n1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:45.880\n You'll see that over 90% of my athletes\n\n1:53:45.880 --> 1:53:47.640\n attack leg locks from underneath people,\n\n1:53:47.640 --> 1:53:48.800\n not on top of people.\n\n1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:50.120\n So there is no positional loss.\n\n1:53:50.120 --> 1:53:51.800\n You're already underneath them.\n\n1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:54.480\n And so that criticism was null and void.\n\n1:53:56.600 --> 1:54:01.240\n And by focusing on this idea of breaking down\n\n1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:04.000\n and distinguishing between the mechanism of control\n\n1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000\n and the mechanism of breaking,\n\n1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.760\n that created something new and something interesting.\n\n1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:13.160\n There was also another advantage that I had\n\n1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:17.320\n in terms of creating influence with leg locking.\n\n1:54:17.320 --> 1:54:19.640\n When you look at the great leg lockers of the past,\n\n1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:21.880\n they were basically iconoclasts.\n\n1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:24.000\n They were people who came out of nowhere\n\n1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:28.440\n who just had this remarkable success with leg locks.\n\n1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:35.200\n But they were just seen as unique individuals.\n\n1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:39.000\n They had their game and they were good at it.\n\n1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:40.400\n What was unique about the squad\n\n1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:43.160\n is you had not just one person,\n\n1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:45.240\n but a team of people who came out\n\n1:54:45.240 --> 1:54:47.800\n and did pretty much the same thing.\n\n1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:50.080\n These people had very different body types\n\n1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:52.440\n and very different personalities.\n\n1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:55.120\n So it wasn't that one kind of body type was good at it.\n\n1:54:55.120 --> 1:54:57.680\n You had tall people like Gordon Ryan.\n\n1:54:57.680 --> 1:55:00.480\n You had short people like Nikki Ryan.\n\n1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:03.520\n You had someone in the middle like Gary Tonin.\n\n1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:05.240\n You had fast people like Gary Tonin.\n\n1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:06.840\n You had slow people like Gordon.\n\n1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.520\n There was every kind of body type involved.\n\n1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:14.600\n And it was like, people could see this was different\n\n1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:17.760\n because it worked for an entire team\n\n1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:19.800\n as opposed to a unique individual\n\n1:55:19.800 --> 1:55:21.840\n who had unique attributes.\n\n1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:23.960\n And then started to foster the belief\n\n1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:28.520\n that if it can work for a team, it can work for anyone,\n\n1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:31.160\n which means it can work for me.\n\n1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:33.400\n And I think that had a big effect.\n\n1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:37.880\n That's why I owe a lot to those early students,\n\n1:55:39.680 --> 1:55:44.680\n Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, Eddie Cummings, and Nikki Ryan.\n\n1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:48.800\n And those four kids came from nowhere.\n\n1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:53.680\n Gary had some success in grappling,\n\n1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:55.480\n like low level success in grappling\n\n1:55:55.480 --> 1:56:00.200\n before becoming a full time member of the squad.\n\n1:56:00.200 --> 1:56:04.720\n But the others were just nobodies who no one had known.\n\n1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:07.000\n And yet within a five year timeframe,\n\n1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:10.240\n they were all going up against world championship competition\n\n1:56:10.240 --> 1:56:13.280\n and doing exceedingly well.\n\n1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:16.160\n And which gives further credence\n\n1:56:16.160 --> 1:56:18.600\n to the idea of the five year program.\n\n1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:23.600\n And I think by operating as a team,\n\n1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:26.360\n those young men did an incredible job\n\n1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.400\n of convincing the grappling world\n\n1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:31.360\n that this wasn't just about, well, they're just different\n\n1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:35.760\n or it works for their body type or them as individuals.\n\n1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:39.360\n It was like, no, if a team can do it, anyone can do it.\n\n1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:41.880\n And I think that's what really convinced people\n\n1:56:41.880 --> 1:56:44.000\n that this was something worth studying.\n\n1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.840\n This is something that could be a big part of their lives.\n\n1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:49.480\n But also convinced you and convinced each other\n\n1:56:49.480 --> 1:56:52.400\n in those early days when you're developing the science.\n\n1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:53.560\n Essentially what was missing\n\n1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:57.680\n is an entire science and system of leg locks.\n\n1:56:57.680 --> 1:57:01.200\n Because it's not like you knew for sure\n\n1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:03.680\n that there's a lot here to be discovered\n\n1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:04.640\n in terms of control.\n\n1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:08.720\n You perhaps hadn't, just like you said, an initial intuition,\n\n1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:12.440\n but you have to have enough,\n\n1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:14.320\n there's perseverance required to take,\n\n1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:16.560\n it's the Johnny Ive thing to take from the initial idea\n\n1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:17.760\n to an entire system.\n\n1:57:17.760 --> 1:57:22.760\n Is there a sense you have about how complicated\n\n1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:26.920\n and how big this world of control in leg locks is?\n\n1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:31.840\n How complicated is it?\n\n1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:33.480\n You've achieved a lot of success.\n\n1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:35.360\n You have a lot of powerful ideas\n\n1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:36.720\n in terms of inside, outside,\n\n1:57:36.720 --> 1:57:38.520\n what's high percentage, what's not,\n\n1:57:38.520 --> 1:57:40.840\n what's higher reward, what's a low risk,\n\n1:57:40.840 --> 1:57:42.760\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:57:42.760 --> 1:57:45.600\n And then you also mentioned kind of transitions,\n\n1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:49.360\n not transitions, but how you move with your opponent\n\n1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:53.520\n to resist their escape through control.\n\n1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:55.920\n How much do you understand about this world?\n\n1:57:55.920 --> 1:57:57.720\n This is a fascinating question.\n\n1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:04.560\n As a general rule, the most powerful developments\n\n1:58:04.560 --> 1:58:08.040\n are always at the onset of a project, okay?\n\n1:58:08.040 --> 1:58:09.360\n Let's give an example.\n\n1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:15.600\n The jet engine was, I believe, first conceived\n\n1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:20.120\n in the late 1930s, just around the time of World War II.\n\n1:58:20.120 --> 1:58:25.120\n It was developed with great pace because of World War II.\n\n1:58:25.200 --> 1:58:28.960\n Obviously, military research was a huge thing back then.\n\n1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:32.960\n And first fielded, I believe, by the jet engine,\n\n1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:37.960\n first fielded, I believe, by the Germans in around 1943.\n\n1:58:40.880 --> 1:58:44.280\n Jet aircraft didn't play a big role in World War II.\n\n1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:45.480\n They were there at the end\n\n1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:47.880\n and they did play a significant role,\n\n1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:50.400\n but in terms of numbers, they just weren't there.\n\n1:58:52.400 --> 1:58:57.400\n So by around 1945, you had the onset of the jet age\n\n1:58:57.400 --> 1:59:00.960\n and the jet engine began to replace the piston engine\n\n1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:01.880\n in most aircraft.\n\n1:59:01.880 --> 1:59:04.480\n It was the new way of doing things.\n\n1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:10.440\n If you look at the pace of development\n\n1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:15.440\n of jet engine aircraft technology from 1945 to 1960,\n\n1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:20.120\n it is unbelievable.\n\n1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:25.000\n There was a solid decade where they were gaining\n\n1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.400\n almost 100 miles an hour per year for a decade.\n\n1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:33.720\n That's a form of growth that, I mean,\n\n1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:35.000\n in the world of engineering,\n\n1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:38.160\n that's the only time you see growth like that\n\n1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:41.960\n is in things like Bitcoin and that's about it, okay?\n\n1:59:43.920 --> 1:59:46.120\n Let's put things in perspective, okay?\n\n1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:51.160\n In World War II, the standard US aircraft bomber\n\n1:59:51.160 --> 1:59:55.480\n was the B17, which was a midsize bomber\n\n1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:57.760\n with a fairly limited load capacity\n\n1:59:57.760 --> 2:00:02.760\n and I think top speed well below 300 miles an hour.\n\n2:00:04.440 --> 2:00:08.200\n Just 10 years later, you had the B52,\n\n2:00:08.200 --> 2:00:10.200\n which could fly across continents\n\n2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:12.320\n and deliver nuclear weapons\n\n2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:15.400\n and carry bomb loads of up to 70,000 pounds.\n\n2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:19.080\n In a decade, that happened.\n\n2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:24.160\n If you took a B17 pilot in 1943\n\n2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:27.480\n and put them inside a B52 a decade later,\n\n2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:30.280\n he would literally think he was on a UFO,\n\n2:00:30.280 --> 2:00:32.800\n a ship from another planet.\n\n2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:36.040\n That was the speed of development.\n\n2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:39.960\n Now, contrast that with the speed of modern development.\n\n2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:42.520\n If I took you in a time machine\n\n2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:48.120\n and I put you in a civil airliner in 1972,\n\n2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:51.720\n let's say a Boeing 737,\n\n2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:55.520\n it's not that different from what you fly in today.\n\n2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:59.120\n Flies at the same speed, has the same range,\n\n2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:01.120\n flies at the same altitude.\n\n2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:02.960\n It's not that different.\n\n2:01:02.960 --> 2:01:07.120\n The amount of progress between 1973 and 2020\n\n2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:09.560\n isn't very impressive,\n\n2:01:10.480 --> 2:01:14.840\n but the amount of progress from 1945 to 1955,\n\n2:01:14.840 --> 2:01:17.520\n or even better, 1960 was staggering.\n\n2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:23.200\n And so the initial progress tends to be meteoric,\n\n2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:25.720\n but after that, it tends to be incremental.\n\n2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:30.480\n That said, there's a guy named Elon Musk.\n\n2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:32.560\n There's been almost no development\n\n2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:37.560\n in terms of space rocket propulsion\n\n2:01:38.800 --> 2:01:43.720\n and rocket launches and going out into orbit\n\n2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:45.720\n or going out into deep space.\n\n2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:47.800\n And one guy comes along,\n\n2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:50.280\n one John Donahue type character,\n\n2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:53.160\n and says, it doesn't make sense why we don't use\n\n2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:56.400\n reusable rockets, why we don't make them much cheaper,\n\n2:01:56.400 --> 2:01:58.440\n why we don't launch every week\n\n2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:00.880\n as opposed to every few years.\n\n2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:04.120\n It doesn't make any sense why we don't go to the moon again\n\n2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:05.120\n over and over and over.\n\n2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:07.320\n It doesn't make any sense why we don't go to Mars\n\n2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:09.360\n and colonize Mars.\n\n2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:14.360\n It feels like it's not just a single jump to a B52.\n\n2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:18.440\n It's a series of these kinds of jumps.\n\n2:02:18.440 --> 2:02:21.720\n So the question is, is there another leap\n\n2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:24.120\n within the leg locking system?\n\n2:02:24.120 --> 2:02:25.280\n Time will tell.\n\n2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:30.320\n I do believe that we're in a phase now\n\n2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:33.920\n where the really big jumps have already been made\n\n2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:36.520\n and we're in the incremental phase at this point.\n\n2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:39.480\n What I do believe is that you will start\n\n2:02:39.480 --> 2:02:42.440\n to see new directions start to emerge,\n\n2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:44.040\n where you start to see the interface\n\n2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:46.560\n between leg locking and race link, for example.\n\n2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.440\n The interface between leg locking and back attacks.\n\n2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:52.640\n And that will provide new avenues of direction\n\n2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:56.520\n which will create new spurts of growth.\n\n2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:00.880\n But in terms of breaking people's legs,\n\n2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:03.160\n just the simple act of breaking legs,\n\n2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:04.880\n I believe we're in the incremental phase now\n\n2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:06.880\n rather than the meteoric phase.\n\n2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:08.360\n Let me ask you a ridiculous question.\n\n2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:10.960\n How hard is it to actually break a leg?\n\n2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:12.160\n Is this something you think about?\n\n2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:13.760\n I remember, because I'm a big fan\n\n2:03:13.760 --> 2:03:17.280\n of the straight foot lock, not, again,\n\n2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:19.720\n we're talking about to the standing Seoi Nage.\n\n2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:22.120\n Maybe it's my Russian roots with Samba\n\n2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:22.960\n or something like that.\n\n2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:26.760\n Maybe it's the Dean Lister, Achilles lock.\n\n2:03:26.760 --> 2:03:30.320\n But I love, maybe it's my body, something like that.\n\n2:03:30.320 --> 2:03:34.000\n I just love the squeeze of it, the control\n\n2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:38.200\n and the power of a straight foot lock.\n\n2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:42.800\n And I remember trying to,\n\n2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:44.480\n there's a few people in competition\n\n2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:45.920\n that didn't want to tap.\n\n2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:47.040\n Absolutely.\n\n2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:52.040\n And I remember in particular, there was one person,\n\n2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:54.040\n again, the finals match, Purple Belt.\n\n2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:56.720\n I remember it was a straight foot lock, it was perfect.\n\n2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.120\n Everything just perfect.\n\n2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.120\n And I remember going all in and there was a pop, pop, pop.\n\n2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.400\n And I couldn't do anything more.\n\n2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:06.960\n It wasn't breaking.\n\n2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:09.320\n It was just bending and bending and bending.\n\n2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:12.160\n And there's damage to it of some kind.\n\n2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:15.880\n But I wanted to like, you know, I wanted to see,\n\n2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:18.000\n first of all, it's very difficult psychologically\n\n2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.760\n because it's like, can I be violent here?\n\n2:04:20.760 --> 2:04:22.800\n That was a whole nother thing.\n\n2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:25.200\n With adrenaline, you can't really think that fast.\n\n2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:27.960\n But I also thought like, where else is there to go?\n\n2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:29.600\n Like, is it the shin going to break?\n\n2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:31.080\n What is it supposed to break?\n\n2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:31.920\n So I wondered that.\n\n2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:33.440\n Yeah, in the case of the Achilles lock,\n\n2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:35.800\n it's going to be the anterior tibialis tendon.\n\n2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:36.640\n What's that?\n\n2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:39.160\n That's the, it runs down, there's two of them.\n\n2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:41.040\n It'll be the minor one that runs on the outside\n\n2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:42.760\n of the front of the ankle.\n\n2:04:42.760 --> 2:04:44.280\n It's not going to be the Achilles tendon.\n\n2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:47.920\n A lot of people promulgate this absurdity.\n\n2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:51.480\n The Achilles tendon can rupture, but not from pressure.\n\n2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:54.120\n Does the tendon or the bone, it's going to break?\n\n2:04:54.120 --> 2:04:56.040\n The bone won't break.\n\n2:04:56.040 --> 2:04:57.920\n I have seen on one occasion,\n\n2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:01.120\n a shin bone break from an Achilles lock,\n\n2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:04.520\n but there was an enormous size and strength disparity.\n\n2:05:04.520 --> 2:05:07.540\n And there may have been other complicating factors too.\n\n2:05:07.540 --> 2:05:11.480\n But in the vast majority of cases,\n\n2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:15.000\n the Achilles lock doesn't really do tremendous damage.\n\n2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.080\n It can do significant damage.\n\n2:05:17.080 --> 2:05:18.240\n You'll definitely feel it the next day,\n\n2:05:18.240 --> 2:05:20.800\n but it's, of all the major locks,\n\n2:05:20.800 --> 2:05:23.400\n it's the one where it is most likely\n\n2:05:23.400 --> 2:05:25.120\n a psychologically strong opponent\n\n2:05:25.120 --> 2:05:27.840\n will be able to absorb damage and go on to win a match.\n\n2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:30.440\n In answer to your first question,\n\n2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:32.340\n how difficult is it to break a leg?\n\n2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:34.480\n Not very difficult.\n\n2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:37.720\n It will come down to what is the skill level\n\n2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:38.840\n of my opponent's resistance?\n\n2:05:38.840 --> 2:05:40.160\n If your opponent is not resisting\n\n2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:41.280\n and you have an inside heel hook,\n\n2:05:41.280 --> 2:05:44.080\n it is absurdly easy to break a man's leg.\n\n2:05:44.080 --> 2:05:45.200\n Not a challenge at all.\n\n2:05:46.340 --> 2:05:48.420\n You can be a 105 pound woman,\n\n2:05:48.420 --> 2:05:53.420\n could easily snap the relevant knee ligaments\n\n2:05:54.680 --> 2:05:56.640\n in a 240 pound man's leg\n\n2:05:56.640 --> 2:05:58.540\n if he doesn't know how to defend himself.\n\n2:05:58.540 --> 2:06:02.000\n That's an easy thing, very easy to accomplish.\n\n2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:06.160\n So the basic answer is yes, it's very easy.\n\n2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:08.040\n If your opponent does know how to defend\n\n2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:10.480\n and they can position their foot,\n\n2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:13.000\n play tricks of lever and fulcrum,\n\n2:06:13.000 --> 2:06:14.640\n it becomes significantly more difficult.\n\n2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:17.600\n It becomes still more difficult under match conditions\n\n2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:21.240\n where they're actively looking to position their body\n\n2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:23.640\n and work their way out of the lock,\n\n2:06:23.640 --> 2:06:26.040\n then it can become very difficult indeed.\n\n2:06:26.040 --> 2:06:31.040\n Always bear in mind that there have been some cases\n\n2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:35.680\n in our history as a team where people have literally\n\n2:06:35.680 --> 2:06:40.680\n just let their knees snap and continue fighting.\n\n2:06:43.100 --> 2:06:45.760\n Always remember that submission is a choice\n\n2:06:45.760 --> 2:06:47.680\n when it comes to the joint locks.\n\n2:06:47.680 --> 2:06:51.480\n And we've had some people who just made the choice\n\n2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:54.080\n that I'm willing to let my knee break\n\n2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:56.840\n so that I can continue in this match.\n\n2:06:56.840 --> 2:06:59.640\n That's a tough decision to make and I admire their bravery.\n\n2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:02.160\n Is there something about that,\n\n2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:04.920\n just to speak to that, that you admire?\n\n2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:07.440\n Yes, it's mental toughness.\n\n2:07:07.440 --> 2:07:09.080\n Would I agree with it, would I advocate it?\n\n2:07:09.080 --> 2:07:12.820\n No, but that doesn't mean I can't admire aspects of it.\n\n2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:17.320\n Who is the greatest grappler ever?\n\n2:07:18.200 --> 2:07:23.200\n You were very astute in the way you asked that question.\n\n2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:26.680\n You didn't say the greatest jiu jitsu player of all time,\n\n2:07:26.680 --> 2:07:28.100\n you specified grappler.\n\n2:07:28.100 --> 2:07:29.840\n What's the bigger category?\n\n2:07:29.840 --> 2:07:31.520\n Jiu jitsu is the bigger category.\n\n2:07:31.520 --> 2:07:33.920\n Jiu jitsu has four faces.\n\n2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:37.720\n There is gi competition, there is no gi competition,\n\n2:07:37.720 --> 2:07:40.120\n there is mixed martial arts competition,\n\n2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.800\n and there is self defense.\n\n2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:43.640\n So jiu jitsu has four aspects.\n\n2:07:44.860 --> 2:07:49.560\n Grappling typically refers only to the no gi\n\n2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:53.040\n aspect of jiu jitsu, so it's one out of four possibilities.\n\n2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:56.480\n So who's the greatest jiu jitsu practitioner ever,\n\n2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:58.920\n and then who is the greatest grappler ever?\n\n2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:02.840\n I believe that the greatest jiu jitsu player,\n\n2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:05.480\n certainly that I ever met, and I believe of all time,\n\n2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:08.640\n I don't want to sound arrogant on that\n\n2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:10.880\n because really you can only go with your own experiences\n\n2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:13.600\n and there are some great athletes that other people mention\n\n2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:15.000\n that I just never met.\n\n2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:19.380\n So, but in my estimation, the greatest jiu jitsu player\n\n2:08:19.380 --> 2:08:24.080\n is Haja Gracie, my reasoning for that is\n\n2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:30.480\n out of the four faces of jiu jitsu, he excelled in three.\n\n2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:34.080\n And in two of them in particular,\n\n2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:36.820\n he was the best of his generation by a landslide.\n\n2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:41.920\n In gi grappling, no gi grappling,\n\n2:08:41.920 --> 2:08:46.400\n Haja dominated his generation to a degree\n\n2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:50.360\n that is truly impressive.\n\n2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:53.400\n What do you attribute that dominance to, by the way?\n\n2:08:53.400 --> 2:08:56.000\n Is there something, if you were to analyze him?\n\n2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.840\n Fascinating question, I'll come back to it.\n\n2:08:58.840 --> 2:09:02.220\n In mixed martial arts, he was at his peak,\n\n2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:05.800\n I believe ranked in the top 10\n\n2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:09.400\n in the world of mixed martial arts.\n\n2:09:09.400 --> 2:09:11.880\n He wasn't the best in mixed martial arts\n\n2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:14.280\n the way he was in grappling, but he was damn good.\n\n2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:17.160\n And he beat some significant people.\n\n2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:19.560\n So he showed tremendous versatility,\n\n2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:21.800\n gi, no gi, mixed martial arts.\n\n2:09:21.800 --> 2:09:24.000\n He's not really known in the world of self defense,\n\n2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.280\n but there's no real criteria by which\n\n2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:28.120\n you would become dominant in self defense.\n\n2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:31.520\n So that's kind of a, you can't really judge people by that.\n\n2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:34.080\n Believe me, if Haja got into a fight in the street,\n\n2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:36.160\n I'm sure he would do just fine.\n\n2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.260\n So I have no concerns about that.\n\n2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:42.600\n So I would say that if you look at jiu jitsu\n\n2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:46.280\n for what I believe it is, a sport with four faces,\n\n2:09:46.280 --> 2:09:50.000\n I believe you have to go with Haja Gracie\n\n2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:53.800\n as the one who went out and empirically proved\n\n2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:58.360\n his ability to go across those elements\n\n2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:01.200\n and do extraordinarily well in all of them.\n\n2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:04.100\n He even made the extraordinary step\n\n2:10:04.100 --> 2:10:06.900\n of coming out of retirement and beating the best\n\n2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:09.520\n of the generation that came after him.\n\n2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:10.360\n That's Asha?\n\n2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:11.920\n Yes, that's a truly difficult feat.\n\n2:10:11.920 --> 2:10:12.760\n That was incredible.\n\n2:10:12.760 --> 2:10:15.160\n Yeah, and a sport which progresses very, very rapidly,\n\n2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:17.160\n that's a truly impressive accomplishment.\n\n2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:22.400\n If you ask the question who is the greatest grappler\n\n2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:26.880\n that I've ever seen, I would say I've never seen\n\n2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:28.480\n anyone better than Gordon Ryan.\n\n2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:32.680\n Now people are gonna jump when I give these two names.\n\n2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:34.880\n They're gonna say, well, Dan, you're close friends\n\n2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:37.640\n with Haja and you're close friends with Gordon,\n\n2:10:37.640 --> 2:10:38.620\n so you're biased.\n\n2:10:38.620 --> 2:10:42.780\n I can't answer them to that, it's true.\n\n2:10:42.780 --> 2:10:44.580\n I'm good friends with both of them.\n\n2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:49.780\n I'm also a notoriously cold and unemotional person\n\n2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:54.780\n and I'm saying this based upon things that I've observed.\n\n2:10:54.780 --> 2:10:57.700\n If I honestly believed that I'd seen other people\n\n2:10:57.700 --> 2:10:59.540\n who were better, I would have said it.\n\n2:11:02.020 --> 2:11:06.180\n Will that convince the people who criticize me\n\n2:11:06.180 --> 2:11:08.600\n are biased, probably not, but those are the two names\n\n2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:09.440\n that I will mention.\n\n2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:11.620\n I think it's an uncontroversial statement to say\n\n2:11:11.620 --> 2:11:16.620\n that Gordon Ryan is one of the greatest grappler ever.\n\n2:11:17.220 --> 2:11:19.740\n Yeah, Gordon's obviously a very polarizing figure\n\n2:11:19.740 --> 2:11:23.460\n and people tend to react to Gordon on an emotional level\n\n2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:26.700\n rather than a statistical level\n\n2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:29.060\n and that colors a lot of people's minds,\n\n2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:31.740\n but I also have the benefit that I've seen both\n\n2:11:31.740 --> 2:11:33.660\n of these guys extensively in the gym\n\n2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:36.420\n and that adds a whole new perspective.\n\n2:11:36.420 --> 2:11:40.060\n If you think those guys are dominant on the stage,\n\n2:11:40.060 --> 2:11:41.380\n wait till you see them in the gym.\n\n2:11:41.380 --> 2:11:43.420\n It's even a different level of domination\n\n2:11:43.420 --> 2:11:46.640\n above and beyond what they did in competition.\n\n2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:50.140\n Have they trained against each other in the gym?\n\n2:11:50.140 --> 2:11:51.100\n No, they never trained together.\n\n2:11:51.100 --> 2:11:53.640\n They've been in the same gym, I think, only on one occasion.\n\n2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:55.420\n When Hodger was stopped by New York,\n\n2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:59.380\n he came by to say hello and Gordon was here at the time.\n\n2:11:59.380 --> 2:12:01.580\n They shake hands, they know each other\n\n2:12:01.580 --> 2:12:04.900\n and they're both wonderful people in their own way.\n\n2:12:04.900 --> 2:12:08.300\n So I'd like to talk to you about Gordon,\n\n2:12:08.300 --> 2:12:12.200\n Hodger and George GSP.\n\n2:12:13.180 --> 2:12:14.940\n Let's first talk about what do you think,\n\n2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:17.260\n because it's very different from my perspective,\n\n2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:21.900\n maybe you can correct me, but very different artists,\n\n2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:24.500\n masters of their pursuits.\n\n2:12:24.500 --> 2:12:26.700\n So what makes Hodger so good?\n\n2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:32.180\n Hodger was probably the living embodiment\n\n2:12:32.180 --> 2:12:36.780\n of someone who played a classical jiu jitsu game\n\n2:12:36.780 --> 2:12:40.820\n based around the fundamental four steps of jiu jitsu.\n\n2:12:40.820 --> 2:12:44.660\n And like if you took someone\n\n2:12:44.660 --> 2:12:49.460\n who had taken introduction lessons in jiu jitsu\n\n2:12:49.460 --> 2:12:54.460\n for three months, they would recognize the outlines\n\n2:12:55.140 --> 2:12:59.180\n of Hodger's game with many of the techniques\n\n2:12:59.180 --> 2:13:02.540\n they learned in those first three months.\n\n2:13:02.540 --> 2:13:06.700\n Hodger was the best example of the dichotomy\n\n2:13:06.700 --> 2:13:09.980\n between the fundamentals of jiu jitsu,\n\n2:13:09.980 --> 2:13:13.420\n but also a kind of hidden sophistication\n\n2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:15.620\n underneath those fundamentals.\n\n2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:20.700\n People always say, oh, Hodger's game was so basic.\n\n2:13:20.700 --> 2:13:24.480\n No, the outlines of Hodger's game were basic,\n\n2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:26.220\n but the degree of sophistication\n\n2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:31.220\n and the application was extraordinary, and his ability\n\n2:13:32.260 --> 2:13:37.260\n to refine existing technology was truly impressive.\n\n2:13:39.660 --> 2:13:42.540\n I never saw anyone in his generation\n\n2:13:42.540 --> 2:13:45.160\n that even came close to his ability,\n\n2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:49.340\n both in competition and in the gym.\n\n2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:50.740\n So for people who don't know,\n\n2:13:50.740 --> 2:13:53.140\n Hodger Gracie basically used, just like you said,\n\n2:13:53.140 --> 2:13:57.700\n a very simple techniques on the surface\n\n2:13:57.700 --> 2:14:02.300\n from the outsider's perspective that most people learn\n\n2:14:02.300 --> 2:14:05.420\n when they start jiu jitsu, like passing guard\n\n2:14:05.420 --> 2:14:09.840\n in a very simple way, taking mount and choking from mount.\n\n2:14:09.840 --> 2:14:13.580\n Also, when he's on his back, it's closed guard\n\n2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:15.580\n and all the basic submissions from closed guard,\n\n2:14:15.580 --> 2:14:20.580\n arm bar and triangle, and just, that's it.\n\n2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:25.580\n And being able to dominate, shut down, and submit.\n\n2:14:25.980 --> 2:14:29.420\n So control and submit the best people in the world\n\n2:14:29.420 --> 2:14:32.420\n for many, many years, just like you said,\n\n2:14:32.420 --> 2:14:37.420\n including coming out of retirement and beating the best,\n\n2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:40.540\n perhaps by far the best of the next generation.\n\n2:14:40.540 --> 2:14:43.020\n So that just kind of lays out the story.\n\n2:14:43.020 --> 2:14:48.020\n Is there some lessons about his systems\n\n2:14:48.020 --> 2:14:52.420\n that you learn in developing your own systems?\n\n2:14:52.420 --> 2:14:53.380\n Excellent question.\n\n2:14:54.420 --> 2:14:58.420\n The thing which always impressed me the most about Hodger\n\n2:14:58.420 --> 2:15:03.420\n was his relentless pursuit of position to submission.\n\n2:15:05.660 --> 2:15:09.960\n Everything was done with the belief\n\n2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:14.140\n that no victory was worthwhile\n\n2:15:14.140 --> 2:15:16.920\n if it didn't involve submitting his opponent.\n\n2:15:16.920 --> 2:15:20.020\n That's a mindset that I tried very, very hard\n\n2:15:20.020 --> 2:15:22.040\n to imbue in my students.\n\n2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:24.180\n The easiest path to victory in jiu jitsu\n\n2:15:24.180 --> 2:15:27.340\n is the one which takes the least risk.\n\n2:15:27.340 --> 2:15:30.480\n So for example, you will see many modern athletes\n\n2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:34.020\n focus on scoring the first point or the first advantage,\n\n2:15:34.020 --> 2:15:36.700\n and then doing the minimum amount of work\n\n2:15:36.700 --> 2:15:40.380\n to eke out a victory once they've done that.\n\n2:15:40.380 --> 2:15:42.260\n They get a small tactical advantage,\n\n2:15:42.260 --> 2:15:44.780\n they realize they're ahead, take no more risks,\n\n2:15:44.780 --> 2:15:48.200\n and just do the minimum amount of work to get the victory.\n\n2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:52.220\n Hodger's mindset was always to take\n\n2:15:52.220 --> 2:15:54.940\n the riskier gambit of submission,\n\n2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:56.780\n which entails a lot more work,\n\n2:15:56.780 --> 2:15:58.580\n and in many cases, a lot more skill.\n\n2:16:01.380 --> 2:16:03.020\n What I always liked about Hodger\n\n2:16:03.020 --> 2:16:05.900\n is he never tried to play tactics.\n\n2:16:05.900 --> 2:16:08.620\n It was always just go out there\n\n2:16:08.620 --> 2:16:10.300\n and try to win by submission.\n\n2:16:11.340 --> 2:16:14.180\n And that more than anything,\n\n2:16:14.180 --> 2:16:19.180\n that mindset of looking for the most perfect victory\n\n2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:23.100\n rather than the victory that takes the least skill\n\n2:16:23.100 --> 2:16:26.860\n and the least effort is probably the thing\n\n2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:28.760\n I took from his career the most\n\n2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.780\n and tried to work on in my students.\n\n2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:35.440\n I always wonder what are the little details\n\n2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:38.100\n he's doing under there when he's in mount,\n\n2:16:38.100 --> 2:16:39.900\n the little adjustments.\n\n2:16:39.900 --> 2:16:43.200\n But perhaps that's almost indescribable,\n\n2:16:43.200 --> 2:16:45.100\n the details of that control.\n\n2:16:47.500 --> 2:16:52.500\n What makes Gordon Ryan, the greatest grappler of all time,\n\n2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:53.940\n so good?\n\n2:16:53.940 --> 2:16:56.620\n With Gordon, he's also very strong on fundamentals,\n\n2:16:56.620 --> 2:16:58.100\n all of my students are,\n\n2:16:58.100 --> 2:17:01.580\n but he's also obviously a member\n\n2:17:01.580 --> 2:17:04.060\n of a new generation of no geek grapplers\n\n2:17:04.060 --> 2:17:06.500\n that also bring in technologies\n\n2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:09.660\n that weren't really emphasized\n\n2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:12.200\n in previous generations specifically.\n\n2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:16.660\n The prolific use of lower body attacks,\n\n2:17:16.660 --> 2:17:18.300\n especially from bottom position.\n\n2:17:20.340 --> 2:17:22.300\n This means that he can play a game\n\n2:17:22.300 --> 2:17:24.940\n between upper body and lower body,\n\n2:17:24.940 --> 2:17:28.040\n which was not really a part of Hodges game.\n\n2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:32.380\n Nonetheless, you will also see significant similarities.\n\n2:17:32.380 --> 2:17:35.860\n He's got a very strong and crushing passing game to mount\n\n2:17:35.860 --> 2:17:42.700\n and a very strong and crushing passing game to the back.\n\n2:17:42.700 --> 2:17:46.660\n You will see that the major differences\n\n2:17:46.660 --> 2:17:49.100\n between the two are from bottom position.\n\n2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:51.060\n Hodges bottom game is essentially based\n\n2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:52.340\n around his close guard.\n\n2:17:52.340 --> 2:17:55.420\n Gordon Ryan's game is based around his butterfly guard.\n\n2:17:55.420 --> 2:17:57.420\n So one is based on outside control\n\n2:17:57.420 --> 2:18:00.060\n and one is based on inside control.\n\n2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:03.180\n One focuses almost entirely on the classical notion\n\n2:18:03.180 --> 2:18:05.840\n of getting past the legs to the upper body\n\n2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:08.380\n and the other one works between the two as alternatives\n\n2:18:08.380 --> 2:18:10.640\n and sees them as competing alternatives\n\n2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:12.540\n where the stronger you become at one,\n\n2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:14.220\n the more your opponent has to overreact\n\n2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:16.180\n and become vulnerable to the second.\n\n2:18:16.180 --> 2:18:19.260\n So they have strong similarities in top position\n\n2:18:19.260 --> 2:18:20.900\n but are very different in bottom.\n\n2:18:22.300 --> 2:18:25.520\n He has, from an outsider's perspective,\n\n2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:30.520\n a calm to him in the heat of battle\n\n2:18:30.520 --> 2:18:35.380\n that's inspiring and confusing.\n\n2:18:35.380 --> 2:18:37.500\n Is there something you could speak\n\n2:18:37.500 --> 2:18:40.700\n to the psychological aspect of Gordon Ryan?\n\n2:18:40.700 --> 2:18:41.540\n Yes.\n\n2:18:42.980 --> 2:18:47.560\n People will talk all day about sports psychology\n\n2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.180\n and they will often have heated arguments\n\n2:18:52.180 --> 2:18:55.000\n as to what's the right psychological state to be in\n\n2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:56.680\n when you go out to compete.\n\n2:18:56.680 --> 2:18:59.380\n I've never seen any one school of thought\n\n2:18:59.380 --> 2:19:03.160\n which gave noticeably better sports performance than another.\n\n2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.320\n I've never seen any psychological mindset\n\n2:19:07.320 --> 2:19:11.040\n prove to be reliably more efficient\n\n2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:13.880\n or effective than another.\n\n2:19:13.880 --> 2:19:17.280\n I've seen fighters that were scared out of their minds\n\n2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:19.200\n when they went out every time to fight\n\n2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:20.980\n and yet they were very successful.\n\n2:19:20.980 --> 2:19:23.980\n I've seen fighters go out who were relaxed and calm\n\n2:19:23.980 --> 2:19:25.760\n and they too can be successful.\n\n2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:29.180\n I've seen both mindsets win, I've seen both mindsets lose.\n\n2:19:29.180 --> 2:19:31.060\n I've seen every extreme between them.\n\n2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:32.580\n What I generally recommend\n\n2:19:32.580 --> 2:19:36.460\n with regards your mind and preparation going in,\n\n2:19:36.460 --> 2:19:37.980\n find what works for you.\n\n2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:39.260\n Everyone's different.\n\n2:19:39.260 --> 2:19:41.420\n Don't try to give a one size fits all\n\n2:19:41.420 --> 2:19:44.980\n in something as vague and confusing as the human mind.\n\n2:19:47.460 --> 2:19:50.620\n Having said that, my preference,\n\n2:19:50.620 --> 2:19:53.220\n I don't force it on people because everyone's different,\n\n2:19:53.220 --> 2:19:56.540\n but my preference is to try and advocate\n\n2:19:56.540 --> 2:20:00.020\n for a mindset of unexceptionalism.\n\n2:20:00.020 --> 2:20:03.340\n Most people see competition as something exceptional.\n\n2:20:03.340 --> 2:20:05.540\n It's not your everyday grappling session.\n\n2:20:05.540 --> 2:20:08.980\n You train 300 times for every time you compete\n\n2:20:08.980 --> 2:20:11.700\n and so they see competition as something exceptional,\n\n2:20:11.700 --> 2:20:14.260\n different, scarier, more nerve wracking.\n\n2:20:14.260 --> 2:20:16.460\n There's a crowd watching, there's cameras.\n\n2:20:16.460 --> 2:20:17.820\n My reputation is on the line.\n\n2:20:17.820 --> 2:20:20.060\n I'm gonna be observed and judged\n\n2:20:20.060 --> 2:20:22.980\n and so they see it as this exceptional event.\n\n2:20:22.980 --> 2:20:25.060\n My general preference is to see it\n\n2:20:25.060 --> 2:20:28.700\n as an unexceptional event, to see everything else,\n\n2:20:28.700 --> 2:20:33.700\n the noise, the cameras, the crowd as illusions.\n\n2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:36.020\n The only reality is a stage,\n\n2:20:36.020 --> 2:20:37.620\n an opponent on the other side of it\n\n2:20:37.620 --> 2:20:39.820\n and a referee adjudicating you\n\n2:20:39.820 --> 2:20:43.700\n and to make it as unexceptional as possible.\n\n2:20:43.700 --> 2:20:48.540\n Gordon does an extraordinarily good job of doing that.\n\n2:20:48.540 --> 2:20:52.380\n Gordon looks more tense in most of his training sessions\n\n2:20:52.380 --> 2:20:54.060\n than he does in his competitions\n\n2:20:54.060 --> 2:20:55.540\n because he knows his training partners\n\n2:20:55.540 --> 2:20:57.540\n are typically better than the people\n\n2:20:57.540 --> 2:20:59.580\n he's actually going out to compete against.\n\n2:21:01.580 --> 2:21:03.420\n And you see it in his demeanor.\n\n2:21:03.420 --> 2:21:06.100\n It's one of just complete calm.\n\n2:21:06.100 --> 2:21:08.740\n It also goes back to what we talked about earlier\n\n2:21:08.740 --> 2:21:11.180\n about the power of escapes.\n\n2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:13.820\n Gordon Ryan is almost impossible to control\n\n2:21:13.820 --> 2:21:16.260\n for extended periods of time\n\n2:21:16.260 --> 2:21:19.220\n in most of the inferior positions in the sport\n\n2:21:19.220 --> 2:21:21.260\n and most of the submissions.\n\n2:21:21.260 --> 2:21:23.380\n So he goes out in the full knowledge\n\n2:21:23.380 --> 2:21:27.340\n that the worst case scenario isn't that bad for him\n\n2:21:27.340 --> 2:21:29.900\n and so nothing could really go that badly wrong.\n\n2:21:29.900 --> 2:21:32.300\n He can always recover from any given mistake\n\n2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:33.860\n and go on to victory.\n\n2:21:33.860 --> 2:21:35.420\n When you believe those things,\n\n2:21:35.420 --> 2:21:37.660\n you're gonna have a calm demeanor.\n\n2:21:37.660 --> 2:21:41.380\n Then if you look at somebody who is quite a bit different\n\n2:21:41.380 --> 2:21:42.980\n than that, George St. Pierre,\n\n2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:46.740\n who at least in the way he describes it,\n\n2:21:46.740 --> 2:21:50.300\n he's basically exceptionally anxious\n\n2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:53.540\n and terrified approaching a fight\n\n2:21:53.540 --> 2:21:56.060\n and he loves training.\n\n2:21:56.060 --> 2:21:56.980\n And hates fighting.\n\n2:21:56.980 --> 2:21:58.500\n And hates fighting.\n\n2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:02.300\n So and just like you said, he made it work for him.\n\n2:22:02.300 --> 2:22:06.060\n But he's somebody, he speaks very highly of you.\n\n2:22:06.060 --> 2:22:08.860\n He's worked with you quite a bit in training.\n\n2:22:10.580 --> 2:22:11.940\n And you've studied him.\n\n2:22:11.940 --> 2:22:13.580\n You've worked with him.\n\n2:22:13.580 --> 2:22:15.540\n You've coached him.\n\n2:22:15.540 --> 2:22:17.180\n Interesting, I've actually coached George\n\n2:22:17.180 --> 2:22:20.140\n for twice the length of any of the squad members.\n\n2:22:20.140 --> 2:22:23.460\n So my knowledge of him is far greater than it is\n\n2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:26.260\n for the contemporary squad.\n\n2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:29.100\n So can you speak to what makes George St. Pierre,\n\n2:22:29.100 --> 2:22:31.900\n who I think even though I'm Russian\n\n2:22:31.900 --> 2:22:35.460\n and a little bit partial towards Fedor and the Russians,\n\n2:22:35.460 --> 2:22:39.300\n but I think he is in the four categories you mentioned,\n\n2:22:39.300 --> 2:22:43.060\n the greatest mixed martial artist of all time.\n\n2:22:43.060 --> 2:22:44.940\n What makes him so good?\n\n2:22:44.940 --> 2:22:48.300\n His approach, his techniques, his mind.\n\n2:22:48.300 --> 2:22:50.260\n His approach is certainly part of it.\n\n2:22:50.260 --> 2:22:57.020\n George started mixed martial arts at a time when the sport\n\n2:22:57.020 --> 2:23:00.460\n was in a pretty wild phase.\n\n2:23:00.460 --> 2:23:04.700\n It was illegal to show on most American TV networks.\n\n2:23:04.700 --> 2:23:09.940\n And there was talk about it being banned as a sport.\n\n2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:12.340\n In his native Canada, it was banned.\n\n2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:15.700\n You could only fight on Indian reservations in Canada.\n\n2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:17.420\n I believe his first fight may have\n\n2:23:17.420 --> 2:23:20.700\n been on an Indian reservation.\n\n2:23:20.700 --> 2:23:26.260\n So the sport at that stage was very much in its infancy.\n\n2:23:26.260 --> 2:23:28.820\n And it's probably fair to say that most\n\n2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.740\n of the athletes involved in the sport\n\n2:23:31.740 --> 2:23:37.860\n came from a training program that would probably\n\n2:23:37.860 --> 2:23:45.620\n describe as unprofessional in the contemporary scene.\n\n2:23:45.620 --> 2:23:48.180\n George is one of a handful of people\n\n2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:50.460\n who started approaching the sport in a truly\n\n2:23:50.460 --> 2:23:51.580\n professional fashion.\n\n2:23:51.580 --> 2:23:53.700\n It was like, OK, here's what great athletes\n\n2:23:53.700 --> 2:23:54.900\n in other sports do.\n\n2:23:54.900 --> 2:23:57.020\n I'm going to try to emulate that.\n\n2:23:57.020 --> 2:24:04.100\n And his ability to invest in himself.\n\n2:24:04.100 --> 2:24:06.100\n In my own experience, for example,\n\n2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:10.140\n George, when I first met him, was a garbage man.\n\n2:24:10.140 --> 2:24:15.180\n And he would jump on a bus from Montreal to New York.\n\n2:24:15.180 --> 2:24:16.860\n Now, that's a long bus ride.\n\n2:24:16.860 --> 2:24:18.700\n He would come down on a Friday afternoon\n\n2:24:18.700 --> 2:24:20.740\n when he finished work as a garbage man,\n\n2:24:20.740 --> 2:24:22.900\n stay for the weekend, and then late on Sunday night,\n\n2:24:22.900 --> 2:24:24.940\n he would jump on a bus all the way back to Montreal\n\n2:24:24.940 --> 2:24:28.340\n and work as a garbage man.\n\n2:24:28.340 --> 2:24:30.980\n That's an extraordinary commitment\n\n2:24:30.980 --> 2:24:34.860\n for a young man to make.\n\n2:24:34.860 --> 2:24:38.660\n And George was a blue belt at the time.\n\n2:24:38.660 --> 2:24:39.660\n And so he would come down.\n\n2:24:39.660 --> 2:24:42.500\n And we had a very talented room.\n\n2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:46.020\n So he didn't do well in the room when he first came in.\n\n2:24:46.020 --> 2:24:47.620\n He was inexperienced in jiu jitsu.\n\n2:24:47.620 --> 2:24:52.540\n And the people who went against were considerably better\n\n2:24:52.540 --> 2:24:53.420\n than him at jiu jitsu.\n\n2:24:53.420 --> 2:24:59.980\n So imagine investing 25% of your weekly income, maybe even more.\n\n2:24:59.980 --> 2:25:03.180\n New York's an expensive town, 50%,\n\n2:25:03.180 --> 2:25:07.700\n to come down and just get your ass kicked month by month.\n\n2:25:07.700 --> 2:25:09.740\n Yeah, that says a lot about who he is.\n\n2:25:09.740 --> 2:25:11.300\n Tells you a lot.\n\n2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:13.380\n First of all, let's talk about the whole idea\n\n2:25:13.380 --> 2:25:14.940\n of delayed gratification here.\n\n2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:17.540\n I mean, that's a guy who's saying,\n\n2:25:17.540 --> 2:25:19.340\n this is highly unpleasant.\n\n2:25:19.340 --> 2:25:22.220\n But I have a vision of myself in the future.\n\n2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:24.860\n And I have to go through this extreme case\n\n2:25:24.860 --> 2:25:27.780\n of delayed gratification to get to that distant goal, which\n\n2:25:27.780 --> 2:25:29.380\n may never happen.\n\n2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:33.300\n And that's a level of commitment and self belief,\n\n2:25:33.300 --> 2:25:35.700\n which is just extraordinary.\n\n2:25:35.700 --> 2:25:38.340\n I always laugh when people say, oh, George was afraid,\n\n2:25:38.340 --> 2:25:41.100\n so he was mentally weak.\n\n2:25:41.100 --> 2:25:45.420\n No, that's a very, very shallow understanding\n\n2:25:45.420 --> 2:25:47.420\n of mental strength and weakness.\n\n2:25:50.020 --> 2:25:53.260\n George felt anxiety.\n\n2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:55.580\n But let's understand from the start,\n\n2:25:55.580 --> 2:25:57.980\n there's different kinds of mental strength.\n\n2:25:57.980 --> 2:26:00.060\n And the most important kind isn't\n\n2:26:00.060 --> 2:26:02.420\n whether you feel fear or don't feel fear\n\n2:26:02.420 --> 2:26:03.860\n before you step into fight.\n\n2:26:03.860 --> 2:26:07.300\n The most important form of mental strength\n\n2:26:07.300 --> 2:26:09.700\n is discipline and training.\n\n2:26:09.700 --> 2:26:11.660\n That's where most people break.\n\n2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:14.980\n I know dozens of people who are fearless to fight,\n\n2:26:14.980 --> 2:26:16.900\n but you couldn't get them to come into the gym\n\n2:26:16.900 --> 2:26:19.900\n for three months in a row and work on skills.\n\n2:26:19.900 --> 2:26:22.700\n So they're mentally strong one way, they don't feel fear.\n\n2:26:22.700 --> 2:26:24.380\n But they're mentally weak in another,\n\n2:26:24.380 --> 2:26:26.980\n which is to instill the discipline which keeps you\n\n2:26:26.980 --> 2:26:29.060\n on a road to progress over time.\n\n2:26:29.060 --> 2:26:31.380\n That's much tougher than not feeling fear\n\n2:26:31.380 --> 2:26:33.180\n before you go out to fight.\n\n2:26:33.180 --> 2:26:36.380\n Understand also that when George talks about fear,\n\n2:26:36.380 --> 2:26:39.180\n he's not afraid of his opponent.\n\n2:26:39.180 --> 2:26:40.100\n He's afraid of failure.\n\n2:26:43.140 --> 2:26:45.780\n He's got high standards.\n\n2:26:45.780 --> 2:26:50.860\n Someone who's got high standards can change the world.\n\n2:26:50.860 --> 2:26:52.820\n His standards were very, very high.\n\n2:26:52.820 --> 2:26:54.180\n That's what he was afraid of.\n\n2:26:54.180 --> 2:26:56.700\n He wasn't afraid of his opponents.\n\n2:26:56.700 --> 2:26:58.980\n And yet, that's always been the misinterpretation.\n\n2:26:58.980 --> 2:26:59.940\n He wasn't mentally weak.\n\n2:26:59.940 --> 2:27:02.540\n He was mentally strong as an ox.\n\n2:27:02.540 --> 2:27:08.380\n To stay in his training regimen year after year after year\n\n2:27:08.380 --> 2:27:10.700\n and do so while he became one of the first stars\n\n2:27:10.700 --> 2:27:13.820\n in mixed martial arts to actually make money.\n\n2:27:13.820 --> 2:27:16.300\n And it gets tough to stay in the training gym\n\n2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:18.060\n with people who are young and hungry\n\n2:27:18.060 --> 2:27:19.740\n and want to punch you in the face.\n\n2:27:19.740 --> 2:27:21.700\n You're coming out of a luxury room,\n\n2:27:21.700 --> 2:27:24.580\n living in finery towards the end of his career\n\n2:27:24.580 --> 2:27:26.060\n and still training as hard as ever.\n\n2:27:26.060 --> 2:27:28.460\n That's an impressive thing.\n\n2:27:28.460 --> 2:27:30.300\n And always he valued perfection.\n\n2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:34.260\n And you're right, the fear was not achieving the perfection.\n\n2:27:34.260 --> 2:27:39.740\n Is there something you've observed\n\n2:27:39.740 --> 2:27:46.260\n about the way he approaches training that stands out to you?\n\n2:27:46.260 --> 2:27:48.020\n Or is it simply the dedication?\n\n2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:49.980\n No, it's never just about dedication.\n\n2:27:49.980 --> 2:27:51.620\n There's lots of dedicated people in the world,\n\n2:27:51.620 --> 2:27:53.020\n but most of them are unsuccessful.\n\n2:27:56.860 --> 2:28:01.900\n If you want to be the best in the world at anything,\n\n2:28:01.900 --> 2:28:06.580\n you have to do, out of the many skills of whatever industry\n\n2:28:06.580 --> 2:28:13.100\n you're in, you have to take at least one of those skills\n\n2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:14.780\n and be the best in the world at it.\n\n2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:21.700\n There's many skills in mixed martial arts.\n\n2:28:21.700 --> 2:28:25.100\n But George identified one skill, which\n\n2:28:25.100 --> 2:28:28.100\n is the skill of striking to take downs.\n\n2:28:28.100 --> 2:28:32.940\n He calls it shootboxing.\n\n2:28:32.940 --> 2:28:37.660\n Shootboxing was barely even a category of skill\n\n2:28:37.660 --> 2:28:38.540\n when George began.\n\n2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:40.900\n It was just the idea that wrestlers grabbed people\n\n2:28:40.900 --> 2:28:44.060\n and took them down the same way they did in wrestling.\n\n2:28:44.060 --> 2:28:48.780\n And you threw some punches before you did it.\n\n2:28:48.780 --> 2:28:56.980\n George largely pioneered the science\n\n2:28:56.980 --> 2:29:02.340\n of creating an interface between striking and take downs.\n\n2:29:02.340 --> 2:29:08.140\n He did it at a time where no one else before him\n\n2:29:08.140 --> 2:29:11.740\n had made it into a system or a science.\n\n2:29:11.740 --> 2:29:14.540\n He did it largely on his own.\n\n2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:20.980\n And I've always said George is the only athlete\n\n2:29:20.980 --> 2:29:25.540\n that I ever coached who taught me more than I taught him.\n\n2:29:25.540 --> 2:29:35.580\n And almost singlehandedly, he created this strong sense\n\n2:29:35.580 --> 2:29:38.700\n of shootboxing as a science, which\n\n2:29:38.700 --> 2:29:41.180\n enabled him throughout his career\n\n2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:44.500\n to determine where the fight would take place.\n\n2:29:44.500 --> 2:29:47.460\n Would it be standing, or would it be on the ground?\n\n2:29:47.460 --> 2:29:49.340\n And that, more than anything else,\n\n2:29:49.340 --> 2:29:51.540\n was the defining characteristic of his success.\n\n2:29:51.540 --> 2:29:55.180\n I will always be immensely impressed\n\n2:29:55.180 --> 2:29:57.220\n by his accomplishment in that regard.\n\n2:29:57.220 --> 2:29:58.300\n He was an innovator.\n\n2:29:58.300 --> 2:30:00.420\n He did things differently.\n\n2:30:00.420 --> 2:30:02.180\n This is such an important point.\n\n2:30:02.180 --> 2:30:05.260\n You can't go out there in combat sports\n\n2:30:05.260 --> 2:30:08.420\n and do the same things that everybody else is doing\n\n2:30:08.420 --> 2:30:11.660\n and expect to get different results.\n\n2:30:11.660 --> 2:30:13.460\n Life doesn't work that way.\n\n2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:15.340\n If you want to be dominant, you've\n\n2:30:15.340 --> 2:30:17.740\n got to find one important part of the sport,\n\n2:30:17.740 --> 2:30:20.740\n and preferably more important than the rest of the sport,\n\n2:30:20.740 --> 2:30:23.980\n and preferably more than one, and be the best in the world\n\n2:30:23.980 --> 2:30:24.580\n at it.\n\n2:30:24.580 --> 2:30:27.700\n You can't be weak at anything, but you can't be strong\n\n2:30:27.700 --> 2:30:28.620\n at everything either.\n\n2:30:28.620 --> 2:30:30.220\n Life's not long enough for us to develop\n\n2:30:30.220 --> 2:30:32.460\n a truly complete skill set.\n\n2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:34.140\n So you've got to be good at everything,\n\n2:30:34.140 --> 2:30:36.620\n and you've got to be the best at at least one thing.\n\n2:30:36.620 --> 2:30:38.780\n And George was the best at two.\n\n2:30:38.780 --> 2:30:43.420\n In his era, he was the best at striking to takedowns,\n\n2:30:43.420 --> 2:30:45.660\n and he was the best at integrating striking\n\n2:30:45.660 --> 2:30:49.260\n and grappling on the floor.\n\n2:30:49.260 --> 2:30:52.300\n Let me ask you a completely ridiculous question,\n\n2:30:52.300 --> 2:30:54.860\n but it's a fascinating one for me\n\n2:30:54.860 --> 2:30:58.500\n from an engineering and a scientific perspective.\n\n2:30:58.500 --> 2:31:02.620\n When I look at a sport, really any problem,\n\n2:31:02.620 --> 2:31:07.860\n one way to ask how difficult is this problem\n\n2:31:07.860 --> 2:31:11.580\n is to see how can I build a machine that competes\n\n2:31:11.580 --> 2:31:13.340\n with a human being at that problem.\n\n2:31:13.340 --> 2:31:14.940\n You can look at chess.\n\n2:31:14.940 --> 2:31:20.180\n You can look at soccer, Robocup,\n\n2:31:20.180 --> 2:31:22.740\n and then you can look at grappling.\n\n2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:25.580\n There's something about when you start to think,\n\n2:31:25.580 --> 2:31:30.140\n how would I build an AI system, a robot that defeats somebody\n\n2:31:30.140 --> 2:31:34.340\n like a Gordon Ryan, where it forces you to really think\n\n2:31:34.340 --> 2:31:41.540\n about formalizing this art as an engineering discipline\n\n2:31:41.540 --> 2:31:45.140\n in the same way you do, but you still have some art\n\n2:31:45.140 --> 2:31:46.540\n injected in there.\n\n2:31:46.540 --> 2:31:48.740\n There's no space for art when you actually have\n\n2:31:48.740 --> 2:31:49.580\n to build the system.\n\n2:31:49.580 --> 2:31:50.940\n That's not a ridiculous question.\n\n2:31:50.940 --> 2:31:52.820\n That's a damn interesting question.\n\n2:31:52.820 --> 2:31:55.740\n Let's put aside, like I mentioned\n\n2:31:55.740 --> 2:31:58.060\n with the Boston Dynamics spot robots,\n\n2:31:58.060 --> 2:32:01.300\n what people don't realize is the amount of power\n\n2:32:01.300 --> 2:32:02.620\n they can deliver is huge.\n\n2:32:02.620 --> 2:32:04.940\n So let's take that weapon aside,\n\n2:32:04.940 --> 2:32:07.540\n just the amount of force you're able to deliver.\n\n2:32:07.540 --> 2:32:10.100\n Yeah, I'm glad you're specifying that.\n\n2:32:10.100 --> 2:32:16.020\n So essentially, your question is, can a talented group\n\n2:32:16.020 --> 2:32:18.940\n of engineers create a robot which could defeat Gordon Ryan?\n\n2:32:18.940 --> 2:32:22.740\n On the face of it, as you just pointed out,\n\n2:32:22.740 --> 2:32:24.580\n that's the easiest project in the world,\n\n2:32:24.580 --> 2:32:27.060\n just create a robot that carries a nine millimeter automatic\n\n2:32:27.060 --> 2:32:28.420\n and shoot them five times in the chest.\n\n2:32:28.420 --> 2:32:30.500\n Okay, that's it, Gordon Ryan's done.\n\n2:32:30.500 --> 2:32:32.300\n So that's not the interesting question.\n\n2:32:32.300 --> 2:32:35.380\n The interesting question, and if I understand you correctly,\n\n2:32:35.380 --> 2:32:41.380\n is if we had the ability to create a robot\n\n2:32:41.380 --> 2:32:45.100\n whose physical powers were identical to Gordon Ryan,\n\n2:32:45.100 --> 2:32:49.380\n not inferior and not superior, what would it take\n\n2:32:49.380 --> 2:32:51.900\n to create a mind inside that robot that would beat\n\n2:32:51.900 --> 2:32:53.580\n Gordon Ryan in the majority of matches?\n\n2:32:53.580 --> 2:32:56.780\n Yeah, and there's two ways to build AI systems.\n\n2:32:56.780 --> 2:33:00.380\n This is true for autonomous driving, for example,\n\n2:33:00.380 --> 2:33:03.300\n which has been quite contested recently.\n\n2:33:03.300 --> 2:33:06.100\n So one is you basically, one way to describe it\n\n2:33:06.100 --> 2:33:09.220\n is you have a giant set of rules.\n\n2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:12.260\n It's like this tree of rules where you apply\n\n2:33:12.260 --> 2:33:14.340\n in different condition when there's a pattern you see,\n\n2:33:14.340 --> 2:33:17.180\n you apply a rule and they're hard coded in.\n\n2:33:17.180 --> 2:33:20.460\n You basically get like a John Donr type of character\n\n2:33:20.460 --> 2:33:26.460\n who tries to encode, hard code into the system,\n\n2:33:26.460 --> 2:33:29.660\n all the moves you should do in every single case.\n\n2:33:29.660 --> 2:33:32.420\n Of course, you can't actually do that fully.\n\n2:33:32.420 --> 2:33:34.980\n So you're going to be taking shortcuts,\n\n2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:36.820\n what are called heuristics,\n\n2:33:36.820 --> 2:33:41.020\n just a basic kind of generalizations\n\n2:33:41.020 --> 2:33:44.980\n and apply your own expertise as an expert of,\n\n2:33:44.980 --> 2:33:47.020\n in this case, grappling,\n\n2:33:47.020 --> 2:33:49.060\n to see how that can be coded as a rule.\n\n2:33:49.060 --> 2:33:50.780\n Now, the other approach,\n\n2:33:50.780 --> 2:33:53.220\n Elon Musk and Tesla are taking this approach,\n\n2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:55.420\n which is called machine learning,\n\n2:33:55.420 --> 2:34:01.820\n which is create a basic framework\n\n2:34:01.820 --> 2:34:05.180\n of the kind of things you should be observing\n\n2:34:05.180 --> 2:34:09.620\n and what are the measures, metrics of success,\n\n2:34:09.620 --> 2:34:13.820\n and then just observe and see which things lead to success,\n\n2:34:13.820 --> 2:34:16.100\n more success and which lead to less success.\n\n2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:17.900\n And there's a delta.\n\n2:34:17.900 --> 2:34:20.580\n Like when you see a thing,\n\n2:34:20.580 --> 2:34:22.500\n first of all, the way machine learning works\n\n2:34:22.500 --> 2:34:26.740\n is you predict, you see a position or you see a situation\n\n2:34:26.740 --> 2:34:28.860\n and then you predict how good that is\n\n2:34:28.860 --> 2:34:31.180\n and then you watch how it actually turns out\n\n2:34:31.180 --> 2:34:34.940\n and if it's worse or better, you adjust your expectations.\n\n2:34:34.940 --> 2:34:39.900\n And through that process, you can learn quite a lot.\n\n2:34:39.900 --> 2:34:43.020\n The challenge is,\n\n2:34:43.020 --> 2:34:46.740\n and this might be a very true challenge in grappling,\n\n2:34:46.740 --> 2:34:52.900\n is like in driving, you can't crash.\n\n2:34:52.900 --> 2:34:55.500\n So there's a physical world.\n\n2:34:55.500 --> 2:34:56.940\n In chess, for example,\n\n2:34:56.940 --> 2:35:00.860\n where this approach has been exceptionally successful,\n\n2:35:00.860 --> 2:35:02.540\n you can work in simulation.\n\n2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:07.660\n So you can have AI system that, for example,\n\n2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:10.180\n as in the case with AlphaZero by DeepMind,\n\n2:35:10.180 --> 2:35:11.780\n Google's DeepMind,\n\n2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:14.940\n it can play itself in simulation millions of times,\n\n2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:16.900\n billions of times.\n\n2:35:16.900 --> 2:35:19.980\n It's difficult to know if it's possible to do that\n\n2:35:19.980 --> 2:35:25.220\n in simulation for anything that involves human movement,\n\n2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:28.260\n like grappling.\n\n2:35:28.260 --> 2:35:31.620\n So that's, my sense is,\n\n2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:34.660\n if we first look at the hard encoding,\n\n2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:39.420\n if you were to try to describe Gordon Ryan to a machine,\n\n2:35:39.420 --> 2:35:41.340\n how many rules are in there, do you think?\n\n2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:43.980\n Yeah, first off, let me tell you,\n\n2:35:43.980 --> 2:35:45.540\n that's one of the most fascinating questions\n\n2:35:45.540 --> 2:35:46.380\n I've ever been asked.\n\n2:35:46.380 --> 2:35:50.100\n And I'm tremendously happy to answer this.\n\n2:35:51.220 --> 2:35:52.780\n How about what we do is,\n\n2:35:52.780 --> 2:35:55.340\n this is a massive question you've asked.\n\n2:35:55.340 --> 2:35:56.780\n There's a huge amount of ways\n\n2:35:56.780 --> 2:35:59.380\n this could get very interesting and very confusing.\n\n2:35:59.380 --> 2:36:03.060\n Let's set some ground rules for the discussion.\n\n2:36:04.780 --> 2:36:11.220\n Lex alluded to the idea of man versus machine and chess.\n\n2:36:11.220 --> 2:36:12.740\n Okay, and I think that's a really good place\n\n2:36:12.740 --> 2:36:14.940\n for us to start the discussion.\n\n2:36:16.700 --> 2:36:20.100\n I'm gonna just tell people about a little bit,\n\n2:36:20.100 --> 2:36:22.060\n the history of man versus chess,\n\n2:36:22.060 --> 2:36:25.380\n to give you guys some background on this.\n\n2:36:25.380 --> 2:36:29.500\n In 1968, there was a party in which a highly ranked,\n\n2:36:29.500 --> 2:36:31.860\n not a world champion, but a highly ranked chess player,\n\n2:36:31.860 --> 2:36:33.180\n his name was Levy,\n\n2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:40.300\n and he met a computer engineer at a party,\n\n2:36:40.300 --> 2:36:45.620\n and they had a lighthearted bet\n\n2:36:45.620 --> 2:36:48.380\n that in a 10 year timeframe,\n\n2:36:48.380 --> 2:36:53.860\n a human chess player would be defeated by a computer.\n\n2:36:53.860 --> 2:36:55.420\n Now, you gotta remember, 1968,\n\n2:36:55.420 --> 2:36:57.580\n computing power was very, very low.\n\n2:36:57.580 --> 2:36:59.940\n The computers that got America to the moon\n\n2:36:59.940 --> 2:37:02.780\n were actually pretty damn primitive.\n\n2:37:02.780 --> 2:37:06.140\n Your iPhone would kick all of their asses.\n\n2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:09.340\n So computational power was very, very low in those days.\n\n2:37:09.340 --> 2:37:12.740\n So interestingly, the chess player fully believed\n\n2:37:12.740 --> 2:37:15.300\n that no computer could beat him in the 10 year timeframe,\n\n2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:18.500\n and the computer engineer was very optimistic\n\n2:37:18.500 --> 2:37:20.820\n that he was wrong, and in fact,\n\n2:37:20.820 --> 2:37:24.220\n 10 years, the computer would win.\n\n2:37:24.220 --> 2:37:26.180\n 10 years later, they had a competition,\n\n2:37:26.180 --> 2:37:29.580\n and the human won, decisively, in fact.\n\n2:37:29.580 --> 2:37:35.340\n So computational power simply hadn't risen to that level yet.\n\n2:37:35.340 --> 2:37:38.700\n Through the 1980s, computational power increased,\n\n2:37:38.700 --> 2:37:43.860\n but not sufficient to get to championship level.\n\n2:37:43.860 --> 2:37:45.780\n There were computer programs in the 1980s\n\n2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:49.700\n which were competitive with good, solid chess players,\n\n2:37:49.700 --> 2:37:54.700\n but not world beaters.\n\n2:37:54.700 --> 2:37:57.660\n Understand right from the start\n\n2:37:57.660 --> 2:38:00.540\n that there's a fundamental problem here.\n\n2:38:00.540 --> 2:38:06.580\n The number of options that the two players in a chessboard\n\n2:38:06.580 --> 2:38:11.380\n can run through is astronomically high.\n\n2:38:11.380 --> 2:38:14.380\n There are 64 squares on a chessboard.\n\n2:38:14.380 --> 2:38:18.860\n The number of possible options that could work\n\n2:38:18.860 --> 2:38:22.340\n or could play out on a chessboard,\n\n2:38:22.340 --> 2:38:26.020\n and this is a truly shocking thing for you to think about,\n\n2:38:26.020 --> 2:38:29.380\n the number of possible options is higher\n\n2:38:29.380 --> 2:38:34.860\n than the number of atoms in the known universe.\n\n2:38:34.860 --> 2:38:38.500\n Think about that for a second in terms of complexity, okay?\n\n2:38:38.500 --> 2:38:44.900\n The number of atoms on this table is massive, okay?\n\n2:38:44.900 --> 2:38:48.780\n That is an unbelievably large number.\n\n2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:51.180\n We're talking about a situation where if a computer\n\n2:38:51.180 --> 2:38:53.900\n had to go through all the options at the onset of a match,\n\n2:38:53.900 --> 2:38:57.300\n they would have to run numbers greater\n\n2:38:57.300 --> 2:39:00.460\n than the number of atoms in the known universe.\n\n2:39:00.460 --> 2:39:05.500\n The number of galaxies in our universe is vast, okay?\n\n2:39:05.500 --> 2:39:06.860\n It's measured in the billions.\n\n2:39:06.860 --> 2:39:08.020\n Like, the number of atoms,\n\n2:39:08.020 --> 2:39:12.100\n that's just a number so mind blowing it's impossible, okay?\n\n2:39:12.100 --> 2:39:17.420\n So no computer is ever going to be able to work\n\n2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:19.740\n with those kinds of numbers, okay?\n\n2:39:19.740 --> 2:39:22.620\n I didn't even know future generations of quantum computers\n\n2:39:22.620 --> 2:39:24.420\n could work with those kinds of numbers.\n\n2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:26.340\n So that's the fundamental problem, okay?\n\n2:39:26.340 --> 2:39:28.700\n The number of options in a chess match\n\n2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:31.580\n is just so astronomically large\n\n2:39:31.580 --> 2:39:34.700\n that no computer could ever figure out\n\n2:39:34.700 --> 2:39:36.220\n all the available options\n\n2:39:36.220 --> 2:39:37.940\n and make decisions in a given timeframe.\n\n2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:40.100\n So that's the fundamental problem.\n\n2:39:40.100 --> 2:39:43.540\n So as Lex correctly pointed out,\n\n2:39:43.540 --> 2:39:46.580\n the way you get around this is by the use of heuristics.\n\n2:39:46.580 --> 2:39:48.780\n These are rules of thumb,\n\n2:39:48.780 --> 2:39:51.740\n which give general guidelines to action.\n\n2:39:51.740 --> 2:39:53.020\n So for example, in jiu jitsu,\n\n2:39:53.020 --> 2:39:55.660\n I could give you a general rule of thumb.\n\n2:39:55.660 --> 2:39:57.980\n Don't turn your back on your opponent, okay?\n\n2:39:57.980 --> 2:39:59.300\n That's a solid piece of advice.\n\n2:39:59.300 --> 2:40:01.340\n There are obviously some exceptions to that rule,\n\n2:40:01.340 --> 2:40:04.060\n but it's a good solid piece of advice to give a beginner.\n\n2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:06.580\n The moment you give that heuristic rule,\n\n2:40:06.580 --> 2:40:09.300\n you rule out a lot of options, okay?\n\n2:40:09.300 --> 2:40:11.380\n You've already told someone don't turn your back,\n\n2:40:11.380 --> 2:40:12.580\n don't turn your back on someone.\n\n2:40:12.580 --> 2:40:14.100\n So a lot of possibilities\n\n2:40:14.100 --> 2:40:16.300\n have just been turned away right there.\n\n2:40:16.300 --> 2:40:18.660\n So you've cut the number of options in half right there\n\n2:40:18.660 --> 2:40:21.220\n just by giving one heuristic rule, okay?\n\n2:40:22.460 --> 2:40:26.700\n If you were decent at chess, not great, but decent,\n\n2:40:26.700 --> 2:40:30.580\n and you knew enough to give say 10 heuristic rules,\n\n2:40:30.580 --> 2:40:34.540\n you could chop that initially vast number of options down\n\n2:40:34.540 --> 2:40:36.260\n by a vast amount.\n\n2:40:36.260 --> 2:40:38.260\n And now you're starting to get to a point\n\n2:40:38.260 --> 2:40:41.900\n where if a computer had sufficient computational power,\n\n2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:45.020\n it could start getting through the number of options\n\n2:40:45.020 --> 2:40:46.660\n in that acceptable timeframe.\n\n2:40:46.660 --> 2:40:50.460\n So that's the general pattern of the development.\n\n2:40:50.460 --> 2:40:52.260\n Now, things started getting very interesting\n\n2:40:52.260 --> 2:40:56.580\n in the mid 1990s with IBM's computer Deep Blue.\n\n2:40:58.660 --> 2:41:01.420\n There was a great chess champion of the late 1980s\n\n2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:05.340\n and early through the 1990s called Gary Kasparov,\n\n2:41:05.340 --> 2:41:08.900\n who had been more or less undefeated for a decade.\n\n2:41:08.900 --> 2:41:12.220\n In 1996, he took on IBM's computer Deep Blue.\n\n2:41:12.220 --> 2:41:16.340\n Just to correct the record, he was undefeated.\n\n2:41:18.460 --> 2:41:20.420\n I apologize, Russian, gotta make sure.\n\n2:41:20.420 --> 2:41:21.980\n They get very nationalistic about their chess.\n\n2:41:21.980 --> 2:41:23.380\n Be careful of these guys.\n\n2:41:23.380 --> 2:41:26.940\n Deep Blue lost the first confrontation, I believe, in 1996.\n\n2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:28.660\n It was competitive, but lost.\n\n2:41:28.660 --> 2:41:32.980\n Then in 1997, Deep Blue won.\n\n2:41:32.980 --> 2:41:35.620\n And it wasn't a complete walkover.\n\n2:41:35.620 --> 2:41:38.060\n Kasparov, I believe, won one of the matches.\n\n2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:43.060\n But they did, Deep Blue unequivocally won the confrontation.\n\n2:41:43.380 --> 2:41:45.660\n And it was seen as like this watershed moment\n\n2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:49.900\n where a computer beat the best human chess player\n\n2:41:49.900 --> 2:41:52.340\n on the planet, and that was it.\n\n2:41:52.340 --> 2:41:54.580\n There's no coming back from that.\n\n2:41:54.580 --> 2:41:57.540\n I think it would be remembered as one of the biggest moments\n\n2:41:57.540 --> 2:42:00.900\n in computing history, is really when the first time\n\n2:42:00.900 --> 2:42:02.500\n a machine beat a human at a thing\n\n2:42:02.500 --> 2:42:04.100\n that humans really care about\n\n2:42:04.100 --> 2:42:06.580\n in the domain of intellectual pursuits.\n\n2:42:06.580 --> 2:42:10.340\n Yeah, it was a powerful, powerful moment.\n\n2:42:10.340 --> 2:42:13.620\n Now, not only was that a powerful moment,\n\n2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:15.740\n but things started getting truly interesting\n\n2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:17.140\n from that moment forward,\n\n2:42:17.140 --> 2:42:18.020\n because then you started having\n\n2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:19.980\n different areas of development.\n\n2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:30.780\n The general way in which the progress is made\n\n2:42:30.780 --> 2:42:32.980\n from those early starts in 1968,\n\n2:42:32.980 --> 2:42:36.900\n all the way through to Deep Blue's victory,\n\n2:42:36.900 --> 2:42:39.420\n was of the use of heuristic rules\n\n2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:42.660\n that brought down the number of potential options\n\n2:42:42.660 --> 2:42:44.300\n to a manageable level.\n\n2:42:44.300 --> 2:42:46.380\n As computer power increased,\n\n2:42:46.380 --> 2:42:48.340\n then it could make faster and faster\n\n2:42:48.340 --> 2:42:50.220\n and wiser and wiser decisions,\n\n2:42:50.220 --> 2:42:52.740\n and make them at a rate which no human,\n\n2:42:52.740 --> 2:42:54.500\n even the best human, could keep up with.\n\n2:42:54.500 --> 2:42:58.540\n So that was the general way in which the debate went.\n\n2:42:58.540 --> 2:43:01.460\n But things got more interesting after this,\n\n2:43:01.460 --> 2:43:06.460\n with the advent of computers that, as you pointed out,\n\n2:43:06.460 --> 2:43:08.780\n make use of so called machine learning.\n\n2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:15.940\n There were, a company put out a program, AlphaZero,\n\n2:43:18.260 --> 2:43:23.260\n which can look at the basic rule structures of chess,\n\n2:43:23.900 --> 2:43:27.100\n and then ultimately play itself in trials,\n\n2:43:27.100 --> 2:43:28.900\n and make trial and error assessment\n\n2:43:28.900 --> 2:43:30.900\n of what are good and bad strategies,\n\n2:43:30.900 --> 2:43:33.140\n so that with no human intervention,\n\n2:43:34.100 --> 2:43:36.700\n a computer could start doing remarkable things.\n\n2:43:38.780 --> 2:43:43.780\n Not only did this company create AlphaZero,\n\n2:43:44.340 --> 2:43:45.940\n and there were some other ones too,\n\n2:43:45.940 --> 2:43:47.380\n they fought not only in chess,\n\n2:43:47.380 --> 2:43:51.660\n but in the much more complex Asian game of Go,\n\n2:43:51.660 --> 2:43:55.220\n which has far more potential options\n\n2:43:55.220 --> 2:43:58.060\n than chess does, by a very significant margin.\n\n2:44:00.060 --> 2:44:02.420\n These machine learning programs,\n\n2:44:02.420 --> 2:44:05.900\n not only easily defeat any human in chess,\n\n2:44:05.900 --> 2:44:07.620\n but in Go as well.\n\n2:44:08.780 --> 2:44:10.500\n And what's truly remarkable\n\n2:44:10.500 --> 2:44:12.300\n is they weren't just beating them.\n\n2:44:13.180 --> 2:44:16.420\n When AlphaZero took on a rival chess program,\n\n2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:19.260\n which by itself was already superior to any human,\n\n2:44:19.260 --> 2:44:23.940\n it only required four hours,\n\n2:44:23.940 --> 2:44:26.780\n starting from learning the rules of chess,\n\n2:44:26.780 --> 2:44:28.740\n to figuring out how to beat\n\n2:44:28.740 --> 2:44:31.780\n the second most powerful chess program in the world.\n\n2:44:31.780 --> 2:44:34.020\n That's insane.\n\n2:44:34.020 --> 2:44:36.380\n That's literally like taking a human,\n\n2:44:36.380 --> 2:44:38.020\n telling the rules of chess,\n\n2:44:38.020 --> 2:44:41.180\n they play some games with themselves for four hours,\n\n2:44:41.180 --> 2:44:42.980\n and they go out and beat Garry Kasparov.\n\n2:44:44.980 --> 2:44:46.780\n This is, I don't know,\n\n2:44:46.780 --> 2:44:51.780\n this is, to me, this is a truly exciting development,\n\n2:44:53.620 --> 2:44:55.540\n far beyond even what Deep Blue did.\n\n2:44:55.540 --> 2:44:57.700\n I like how you said exciting, not terrifying,\n\n2:44:57.700 --> 2:44:59.860\n because I agree with you on the exciting.\n\n2:44:59.860 --> 2:45:03.460\n Now, things also get exciting in a different direction.\n\n2:45:03.460 --> 2:45:05.620\n There is another possibility,\n\n2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:10.060\n which few people foresaw after the Deep Blue episode.\n\n2:45:10.060 --> 2:45:14.060\n This is where a new form of chess started to emerge,\n\n2:45:14.060 --> 2:45:17.260\n sometimes called cyborg chess or centaur chess,\n\n2:45:18.860 --> 2:45:23.340\n where humans of moderate chess level playing ability,\n\n2:45:23.340 --> 2:45:27.020\n not world champions, just decent, but not great,\n\n2:45:27.020 --> 2:45:30.220\n I guess you might say like purple belts in jiu jitsu,\n\n2:45:30.220 --> 2:45:33.460\n allied themselves with computers.\n\n2:45:33.460 --> 2:45:37.500\n So the humans and computers worked as a cyborg team.\n\n2:45:38.820 --> 2:45:43.020\n The humans supplied the heuristic insight.\n\n2:45:43.020 --> 2:45:46.020\n The computers supplied the computational power.\n\n2:45:46.900 --> 2:45:51.540\n And fascinatingly, they proved to be superior\n\n2:45:51.540 --> 2:45:55.020\n to both the best humans and the best chess programs.\n\n2:45:56.620 --> 2:46:01.020\n The united force of human insight with heuristics,\n\n2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:04.340\n with computers ability to go through numbers\n\n2:46:04.340 --> 2:46:08.020\n in far more rapid form than any human could ever hope to do,\n\n2:46:08.020 --> 2:46:10.300\n proved to be one of the strongest combinations\n\n2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:15.300\n and enabled that pairing of human and computer\n\n2:46:15.620 --> 2:46:18.780\n to overwhelm both the best single human\n\n2:46:18.780 --> 2:46:21.660\n and the best single computer.\n\n2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:26.580\n That adds a whole new level of fascination to this topic.\n\n2:46:26.580 --> 2:46:29.180\n So to wind things up here,\n\n2:46:29.180 --> 2:46:33.740\n we've got this fascinating initial question from Lex,\n\n2:46:33.740 --> 2:46:38.740\n the idea of could there be a computer inside a robot\n\n2:46:38.740 --> 2:46:42.860\n which doesn't have any special physical properties?\n\n2:46:42.860 --> 2:46:44.900\n This is mind versus mind\n\n2:46:44.900 --> 2:46:46.220\n because the bodies negate each other.\n\n2:46:46.220 --> 2:46:48.780\n The robot is the same body as Gordon Ryan.\n\n2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:50.420\n This is a thought experiment.\n\n2:46:50.420 --> 2:46:53.500\n What would it take to create a mind\n\n2:46:53.500 --> 2:46:56.300\n that would defeat the mind of Gordon Ryan?\n\n2:46:58.980 --> 2:47:00.940\n Based on the chess example,\n\n2:47:02.020 --> 2:47:04.820\n it would appear that this is entirely feasible\n\n2:47:04.820 --> 2:47:06.060\n at some point in the future.\n\n2:47:06.060 --> 2:47:07.420\n And in fact, I would go further and say,\n\n2:47:07.420 --> 2:47:09.220\n it's actually quite likely\n\n2:47:09.220 --> 2:47:13.500\n based on what we've seen from the example of chess.\n\n2:47:13.500 --> 2:47:18.020\n The rate of progress in AI in the last 20 years\n\n2:47:19.540 --> 2:47:23.380\n has dwarfed anything from the previous 50 years.\n\n2:47:24.500 --> 2:47:27.380\n And the rate continues to increase.\n\n2:47:28.940 --> 2:47:31.900\n We're talking now at a level where the machine learning\n\n2:47:31.900 --> 2:47:37.860\n of defeating world champions in chess and Go in four hours,\n\n2:47:37.860 --> 2:47:41.380\n like just from starting from the rules of the sport,\n\n2:47:44.340 --> 2:47:47.500\n this is gonna be difficult for humans to keep up with.\n\n2:47:47.500 --> 2:47:52.100\n Now in humans favor, could we take Gordon Ryan\n\n2:47:52.100 --> 2:47:54.700\n and put a chip inside his brain\n\n2:47:54.700 --> 2:47:56.620\n that created the same cyborg effect\n\n2:47:56.620 --> 2:47:59.380\n as we saw in centaur chess and cyborg chess,\n\n2:47:59.380 --> 2:48:01.700\n and then take Gordon Ryan to a new level\n\n2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:03.820\n and suddenly his computational powers\n\n2:48:03.820 --> 2:48:05.300\n were massively increased.\n\n2:48:05.300 --> 2:48:08.260\n He still has his heuristic insight,\n\n2:48:08.260 --> 2:48:11.980\n but he has vastly augmented computational powers.\n\n2:48:11.980 --> 2:48:13.740\n That's the interesting battle.\n\n2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:16.900\n You asked a great question, Lex.\n\n2:48:16.900 --> 2:48:19.860\n Let me give you my initial push for an answer\n\n2:48:19.860 --> 2:48:22.700\n would be that if it's just Gordon Ryan\n\n2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:27.060\n versus your robot technology,\n\n2:48:27.060 --> 2:48:29.500\n in 10 years, I would say with machine learning,\n\n2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:31.900\n I'd say you guys win every time.\n\n2:48:31.900 --> 2:48:36.220\n But if it is cyborg Gordon Ryan,\n\n2:48:36.220 --> 2:48:40.660\n where he's part Gordon Ryan with heuristics\n\n2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:43.780\n and part machine, then, and now that's where I throw\n\n2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:48.140\n the question back at you, young man, what do you think?\n\n2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:49.660\n Well, I'm fascinated to hear your answer.\n\n2:48:49.660 --> 2:48:52.220\n That's very interesting because there's a lot\n\n2:48:52.220 --> 2:48:55.100\n of different ways you can build a cyborg Gordon Ryan.\n\n2:48:55.100 --> 2:48:58.260\n So one is there's the Neuralink way,\n\n2:48:58.260 --> 2:49:03.260\n which is basically doing what you're suggesting,\n\n2:49:03.980 --> 2:49:06.980\n which is expanding the computational capabilities\n\n2:49:06.980 --> 2:49:08.260\n of Gordon Ryan's brain,\n\n2:49:09.820 --> 2:49:11.660\n like directly being able to communicate\n\n2:49:11.660 --> 2:49:13.540\n between a computer and the brain.\n\n2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:18.540\n So you preserve most of what there is in the human body,\n\n2:49:20.060 --> 2:49:22.620\n including the nervous system and the computing system\n\n2:49:22.620 --> 2:49:24.380\n we currently have that's biological\n\n2:49:24.380 --> 2:49:26.420\n and expanding over the computer.\n\n2:49:26.420 --> 2:49:28.780\n There's also on the cyborg chess front,\n\n2:49:30.780 --> 2:49:35.220\n like Magnus Carlsen, the current world champion in chess,\n\n2:49:35.220 --> 2:49:38.620\n he studies AlphaZero games.\n\n2:49:38.620 --> 2:49:42.220\n Like it's not a regular thing for high level grandmasters.\n\n2:49:42.220 --> 2:49:45.580\n From what I understand, almost every chess master\n\n2:49:45.580 --> 2:49:48.700\n now studies computer games for inspiration.\n\n2:49:48.700 --> 2:49:53.700\n Like just as great chess players from the past\n\n2:49:53.700 --> 2:49:56.780\n used to go back into old leather bound books\n\n2:49:56.780 --> 2:50:00.100\n of previous grandmasters and study games and books.\n\n2:50:00.100 --> 2:50:03.360\n Nowadays, most people, when they wanna study\n\n2:50:03.360 --> 2:50:04.340\n the most perfect games,\n\n2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:06.860\n they actually study programs like AlphaZero.\n\n2:50:06.860 --> 2:50:09.980\n Yeah, and it's not just for inspiration, it's education.\n\n2:50:09.980 --> 2:50:12.340\n I mean, it's literally part of their training regimen.\n\n2:50:12.340 --> 2:50:14.820\n This isn't like a fun side thing.\n\n2:50:14.820 --> 2:50:17.300\n This is the main way to get better.\n\n2:50:18.180 --> 2:50:21.380\n So there's a certain element there\n\n2:50:21.380 --> 2:50:24.420\n where even our human brains can be trained\n\n2:50:24.420 --> 2:50:29.020\n by observing the partial explorations\n\n2:50:29.020 --> 2:50:32.180\n of an AI systems in the space of grappling.\n\n2:50:32.180 --> 2:50:34.260\n That could be actually in simulation.\n\n2:50:34.260 --> 2:50:35.660\n It doesn't have to be in the physical world.\n\n2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:40.660\n It could be in, if we construct sufficiently good\n\n2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:43.940\n biomechanical models of human beings,\n\n2:50:43.940 --> 2:50:46.260\n machines can learn how they grapple.\n\n2:50:46.260 --> 2:50:49.580\n There's quite a bit of that already.\n\n2:50:49.580 --> 2:50:53.300\n OpenAI has the system of, they're like sumo wrestlers\n\n2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:58.060\n with some basic goals of pushing each other off of a platform.\n\n2:50:58.060 --> 2:51:01.060\n And you know nothing from the, you don't even know.\n\n2:51:01.060 --> 2:51:04.700\n So you have a basic model of a bipedal system.\n\n2:51:04.700 --> 2:51:07.020\n It doesn't even know in the beginning how to stand up.\n\n2:51:07.020 --> 2:51:08.620\n It just falls, right?\n\n2:51:08.620 --> 2:51:10.940\n So it has to learn how to get up\n\n2:51:10.940 --> 2:51:13.080\n and they do that through self play.\n\n2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:15.980\n They learn how to get up, they learn how to move\n\n2:51:15.980 --> 2:51:18.220\n enough to achieve the final goal\n\n2:51:18.220 --> 2:51:20.420\n which is to push your opponent off of the thing.\n\n2:51:20.420 --> 2:51:22.700\n So they learn that.\n\n2:51:22.700 --> 2:51:26.540\n Now OpenAI is not, those folks are currently\n\n2:51:26.540 --> 2:51:28.580\n not that interested in the grappling world.\n\n2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:30.260\n So they kind of stop there.\n\n2:51:30.260 --> 2:51:35.260\n But it's very possible in simulation to then develop ideas.\n\n2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:38.940\n In fact, this is something that I should probably do,\n\n2:51:38.940 --> 2:51:41.260\n but it's pretty natural to do it easy,\n\n2:51:41.260 --> 2:51:45.100\n is ideas of control and submission and all the,\n\n2:51:45.100 --> 2:51:49.820\n you add the ability to, I don't know how to put it nicely,\n\n2:51:49.820 --> 2:51:54.060\n but to choke your opponent\n\n2:51:54.060 --> 2:51:57.980\n and to break their body parts off,\n\n2:51:57.980 --> 2:52:00.140\n which is what jiu jitsu is.\n\n2:52:00.140 --> 2:52:03.980\n Add that in and what kind of ideas it'll come up with\n\n2:52:03.980 --> 2:52:05.580\n is very fascinating.\n\n2:52:05.580 --> 2:52:07.380\n I actually don't know, until this conversation,\n\n2:52:07.380 --> 2:52:08.860\n I don't know why I never even thought about that.\n\n2:52:08.860 --> 2:52:11.020\n I've been very obsessed with just like walking\n\n2:52:11.020 --> 2:52:13.860\n and running and all those kinds of things,\n\n2:52:13.860 --> 2:52:16.300\n like evolving different strategies\n\n2:52:16.300 --> 2:52:18.820\n for when you have a bunch of,\n\n2:52:18.820 --> 2:52:21.180\n so one difficult thing for robots\n\n2:52:21.180 --> 2:52:22.660\n is when you have uneven terrain\n\n2:52:22.660 --> 2:52:24.180\n and there's uncertainty about the terrain\n\n2:52:24.180 --> 2:52:25.780\n is how to keep walking.\n\n2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:28.980\n Or when there's a bunch of things being thrown at you,\n\n2:52:28.980 --> 2:52:29.940\n all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:52:29.940 --> 2:52:32.900\n and you learn through self play\n\n2:52:32.900 --> 2:52:35.220\n how to be able to navigate those uncertain environments\n\n2:52:35.220 --> 2:52:36.980\n when there's a lot of weird objects\n\n2:52:36.980 --> 2:52:38.500\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:52:38.500 --> 2:52:40.340\n There's no reason why you can't just do that\n\n2:52:40.340 --> 2:52:43.420\n with submissions and so on in simulation.\n\n2:52:43.420 --> 2:52:44.860\n That'll be actually fascinating.\n\n2:52:44.860 --> 2:52:49.020\n But once we might be surprised\n\n2:52:49.020 --> 2:52:52.260\n by the kind of strategies in simulation\n\n2:52:52.260 --> 2:52:54.620\n these AI systems will develop,\n\n2:52:54.620 --> 2:52:57.020\n and that might make a much better Gordon Ryan\n\n2:52:57.020 --> 2:52:58.740\n and much better John Donahar\n\n2:52:58.740 --> 2:53:01.840\n in asking the Dean Lister question of like,\n\n2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:03.760\n why are we only using,\n\n2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:06.260\n why are we not doing X?\n\n2:53:06.260 --> 2:53:10.340\n But on the actual sort of grappling event\n\n2:53:10.340 --> 2:53:12.620\n in the physical space,\n\n2:53:12.620 --> 2:53:15.540\n I've been very surprised and a little bit disappointed\n\n2:53:15.540 --> 2:53:18.460\n by how difficult it's to build\n\n2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:25.880\n a system that's able to have the body of Gordon Ryan\n\n2:53:26.380 --> 2:53:28.000\n or a human being actually,\n\n2:53:28.900 --> 2:53:31.820\n which means it's not just the biomechanics\n\n2:53:31.820 --> 2:53:33.660\n which is very difficult to do,\n\n2:53:33.660 --> 2:53:37.840\n but also all of the senses that are involved.\n\n2:53:37.840 --> 2:53:40.340\n Be able to perceive the world as richly,\n\n2:53:40.340 --> 2:53:43.660\n to be able to, there's something called soft robotics,\n\n2:53:43.660 --> 2:53:47.620\n which is incredibly difficult to do through touch,\n\n2:53:47.620 --> 2:53:50.060\n understand the hardness of things.\n\n2:53:50.060 --> 2:53:52.780\n We don't understand as human beings\n\n2:53:52.780 --> 2:53:56.220\n just how much we're able through touch\n\n2:53:56.220 --> 2:53:59.480\n to experience the world and to manipulate the world.\n\n2:53:59.480 --> 2:54:02.180\n Like the process of picking up a cup\n\n2:54:03.180 --> 2:54:05.220\n is very similar to the process of grappling.\n\n2:54:05.220 --> 2:54:07.160\n All the feeling that you do,\n\n2:54:07.160 --> 2:54:09.340\n all the leverage that you're applying,\n\n2:54:09.340 --> 2:54:11.400\n there's so many degrees of freedom\n\n2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:14.580\n in both the, in the interactive sense,\n\n2:54:14.580 --> 2:54:16.140\n in the sensing and the applying,\n\n2:54:16.140 --> 2:54:17.060\n sensing and applying,\n\n2:54:17.060 --> 2:54:20.420\n you're doing that through so much of your body,\n\n2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:23.620\n that it's just going to be very difficult\n\n2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:26.660\n to build a system that's able to experience the world\n\n2:54:26.660 --> 2:54:30.180\n and act onto the world as richly as we humans can.\n\n2:54:30.180 --> 2:54:33.060\n Yeah, if picking up a cup\n\n2:54:33.060 --> 2:54:36.180\n is a seemingly insurmountable challenge,\n\n2:54:36.180 --> 2:54:39.020\n then taking someone down, controlling them,\n\n2:54:39.020 --> 2:54:40.020\n getting past their legs,\n\n2:54:40.020 --> 2:54:42.660\n that's going to be one hell of a project.\n\n2:54:42.660 --> 2:54:44.980\n Exactly, I mean, there could be shortcuts,\n\n2:54:44.980 --> 2:54:49.460\n but I mean, currently that's the field\n\n2:54:49.460 --> 2:54:52.820\n called robotic manipulation, which is picking up objects.\n\n2:54:52.820 --> 2:54:55.660\n Usually they have like a ball and a triangular object\n\n2:54:55.660 --> 2:54:57.620\n and your whole task is to like pick it up\n\n2:54:57.620 --> 2:54:59.600\n and move it around.\n\n2:54:59.600 --> 2:55:04.420\n Generalizing that to the human body is harder,\n\n2:55:04.420 --> 2:55:09.060\n but perhaps not as hard as we might think.\n\n2:55:09.060 --> 2:55:11.480\n The question is, how do you construct experiments\n\n2:55:11.480 --> 2:55:13.420\n where you can do that safely?\n\n2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:15.340\n In chess, that's very easy,\n\n2:55:15.340 --> 2:55:18.720\n but here it's very, very problematic.\n\n2:55:22.420 --> 2:55:24.780\n I guess you could just have robot versus robot\n\n2:55:25.860 --> 2:55:27.540\n teamed up with each other and then they learn\n\n2:55:27.540 --> 2:55:29.460\n and then they go out to take on a human opponent.\n\n2:55:29.460 --> 2:55:33.260\n Yes, exactly, so you have two physical robots\n\n2:55:33.260 --> 2:55:35.340\n that interact with each other.\n\n2:55:35.340 --> 2:55:37.100\n Everything you've said so far suggests\n\n2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:40.420\n that many of the problems, these tactile elements,\n\n2:55:40.420 --> 2:55:43.580\n they're easy tasks for humans.\n\n2:55:43.580 --> 2:55:46.260\n So which becomes more powerful more quickly?\n\n2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:49.580\n Robots that are taught to think like humans\n\n2:55:49.580 --> 2:55:52.460\n or humans that are given the computational power\n\n2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:56.980\n of computers and robots themselves,\n\n2:55:56.980 --> 2:55:59.960\n which wins first, a cyborg Gordon Ryan\n\n2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:03.360\n or an artificial robot Gordon Ryan?\n\n2:56:03.360 --> 2:56:05.180\n Really, really strong question,\n\n2:56:05.180 --> 2:56:09.700\n and I think by far the cyborg Gordon Ryan.\n\n2:56:09.700 --> 2:56:11.260\n Yeah, that's what I'm thinking here.\n\n2:56:11.260 --> 2:56:13.060\n The problems you're talking about\n\n2:56:14.260 --> 2:56:16.660\n with regards to the robots, those are deep problems.\n\n2:56:16.660 --> 2:56:20.020\n Like if picking up a cup is problematic,\n\n2:56:20.020 --> 2:56:22.260\n it's gonna be damn difficult,\n\n2:56:22.260 --> 2:56:25.420\n but to a human, a two year old can do that.\n\n2:56:25.420 --> 2:56:28.140\n You're highlighting a very important difference\n\n2:56:28.140 --> 2:56:31.380\n is human beings have something called common sense\n\n2:56:32.260 --> 2:56:35.020\n that we don't know how to build into computers currently.\n\n2:56:35.020 --> 2:56:36.820\n That's what picking up the cup is.\n\n2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:41.340\n It's some basic rules about the way this world works.\n\n2:56:41.340 --> 2:56:43.420\n We're able to, this is when we're children\n\n2:56:43.420 --> 2:56:46.140\n and we'll crawl around and we pick up.\n\n2:56:46.140 --> 2:56:48.500\n What humans don't have that machines have\n\n2:56:48.500 --> 2:56:52.020\n is incredible computational power\n\n2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:54.440\n and access to infinite knowledge.\n\n2:56:54.440 --> 2:56:55.500\n Computers can do that.\n\n2:56:55.500 --> 2:56:58.460\n So if you have a Gordon Ryan with the infinite knowledge\n\n2:56:58.460 --> 2:57:01.820\n and compute power, that's just going to,\n\n2:57:01.820 --> 2:57:03.700\n because we know how to do that,\n\n2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:07.660\n that's going to blow out of the water\n\n2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:08.500\n a robot that's trying to learn to crawl.\n\n2:57:08.500 --> 2:57:12.180\n Has there been any update on the phenomenon\n\n2:57:12.180 --> 2:57:14.420\n of cyborg or centaur chess?\n\n2:57:14.420 --> 2:57:16.580\n There was some debate as to whether or not\n\n2:57:19.220 --> 2:57:22.740\n cyborg chess teams could stay competitive\n\n2:57:22.740 --> 2:57:25.940\n with the latest machine learning.\n\n2:57:25.940 --> 2:57:27.740\n Has there been any update on that?\n\n2:57:27.740 --> 2:57:31.060\n I believe at this point machines dominate\n\n2:57:31.060 --> 2:57:34.740\n over the machine human pairs.\n\n2:57:34.740 --> 2:57:37.700\n With the human pairs, when they first came out,\n\n2:57:37.700 --> 2:57:41.740\n they were good chess players, but not great chess players.\n\n2:57:41.740 --> 2:57:43.900\n Does it make any difference if you have, say,\n\n2:57:43.900 --> 2:57:48.900\n Garry Kasparov and a computer working in unison\n\n2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:52.620\n versus Joe Blow from?\n\n2:57:52.620 --> 2:57:53.920\n It does make a huge difference,\n\n2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:56.740\n but yeah, both are destroyed by machines at this point.\n\n2:57:56.740 --> 2:57:58.220\n And it's not even competitive now?\n\n2:57:58.220 --> 2:57:59.460\n No, it's not competitive.\n\n2:57:59.460 --> 2:58:03.220\n But they also lost interest in this kind of idea.\n\n2:58:03.220 --> 2:58:04.940\n So I think there's still competitions\n\n2:58:04.940 --> 2:58:09.220\n between human machine pairs versus human machine pairs,\n\n2:58:09.220 --> 2:58:12.660\n almost like to see how the two work together.\n\n2:58:12.660 --> 2:58:14.980\n But in terms of machine versus human machine pair,\n\n2:58:14.980 --> 2:58:16.060\n machines still dominate.\n\n2:58:16.060 --> 2:58:16.900\n Interesting.\n\n2:58:16.900 --> 2:58:21.900\n So, and now we've retrieved back as human beings\n\n2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:24.580\n caring mostly about human versus human competitions,\n\n2:58:24.580 --> 2:58:27.140\n which is probably what the future will look like.\n\n2:58:27.140 --> 2:58:29.060\n It's very interesting to think,\n\n2:58:29.060 --> 2:58:32.200\n but like that in chess happened really quickly.\n\n2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:36.340\n It won't happen, and it wasn't so painful in chess\n\n2:58:36.340 --> 2:58:37.420\n because we care about chess,\n\n2:58:37.420 --> 2:58:40.640\n but it's not so fundamental to human society.\n\n2:58:41.680 --> 2:58:46.180\n And when you started talking about cyborg Gordon Ryans,\n\n2:58:46.180 --> 2:58:49.140\n which really beyond grappling is referring\n\n2:58:49.140 --> 2:58:52.180\n to robots operating physical space\n\n2:58:52.180 --> 2:58:56.300\n or human robot hybrids operating physical space,\n\n2:58:56.300 --> 2:59:00.140\n you're talking about our society is now full of cyborgs.\n\n2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:00.980\n Yes.\n\n2:59:00.980 --> 2:59:05.160\n And that transition might be very painful\n\n2:59:05.160 --> 2:59:10.160\n or transformative in a way we can't even predict.\n\n2:59:10.420 --> 2:59:13.820\n And that very much has applications\n\n2:59:13.820 --> 2:59:17.180\n as both China and US now have legalized\n\n2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:20.720\n is autonomous weapon systems.\n\n2:59:20.720 --> 2:59:24.940\n So use of these kinds of systems in military applications.\n\n2:59:24.940 --> 2:59:27.180\n So it used to be, there'd been a big call\n\n2:59:27.180 --> 2:59:29.620\n in the AI community to ban autonomous weapons.\n\n2:59:29.620 --> 2:59:33.600\n So the use of artificial intelligence in war,\n\n2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:37.780\n just like bioweapons are banned internationally.\n\n2:59:37.780 --> 2:59:40.220\n So you're not allowed to use bioweapons in war.\n\n2:59:40.220 --> 2:59:43.320\n And actually most people, even terrorists,\n\n2:59:43.320 --> 2:59:46.420\n have kind of agreed on this ban.\n\n2:59:46.420 --> 2:59:49.340\n It's not like, there's been a quiet agreement,\n\n2:59:49.340 --> 2:59:51.080\n like we're not going to be doing this\n\n2:59:51.080 --> 2:59:54.240\n because everybody's gonna get really pissed off.\n\n2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:58.240\n With autonomous weapon systems, that's not been the case.\n\n2:59:59.260 --> 3:00:01.820\n China has said that they're going to be using AI\n\n3:00:01.820 --> 3:00:03.140\n in their military.\n\n3:00:03.140 --> 3:00:08.140\n And the US in 2021 just released a report\n\n3:00:08.420 --> 3:00:12.900\n saying that they're going to add\n\n3:00:12.900 --> 3:00:15.300\n increasing amounts of artificial intelligence\n\n3:00:15.300 --> 3:00:17.260\n into our military systems.\n\n3:00:17.260 --> 3:00:19.780\n Into drones, into just everything that's doing\n\n3:00:19.780 --> 3:00:24.320\n any kind of both strategic and actual bombing\n\n3:00:24.320 --> 3:00:27.180\n and defense systems.\n\n3:00:27.180 --> 3:00:31.120\n I presume a drone army would easily defeat\n\n3:00:31.120 --> 3:00:33.540\n a human army in the near future.\n\n3:00:33.540 --> 3:00:38.540\n Like, I mean, just off the top of my head,\n\n3:00:38.540 --> 3:00:40.980\n just think about the implication of kamikaze drones\n\n3:00:40.980 --> 3:00:42.300\n versus a naval fleet.\n\n3:00:42.300 --> 3:00:45.620\n I mean, kamikazes was humans in World War II,\n\n3:00:45.620 --> 3:00:47.940\n did terrible damage to our navy.\n\n3:00:47.940 --> 3:00:52.940\n Imagine swarms of mechanical kamikazes\n\n3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:55.980\n which have no fear, no remorse, I mean.\n\n3:00:55.980 --> 3:00:58.580\n But it's very inefficient.\n\n3:00:58.580 --> 3:00:59.960\n Kamikaze is very inefficient.\n\n3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:03.440\n You want to be very, like war is,\n\n3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:06.100\n it's the same discussion to jiu jitsu, right?\n\n3:01:06.100 --> 3:01:10.660\n You want to be, you want to create an asymmetry of power\n\n3:01:10.660 --> 3:01:12.580\n and you want to be efficient is in the way you deliver\n\n3:01:12.580 --> 3:01:13.860\n that power.\n\n3:01:13.860 --> 3:01:17.060\n It's actually goes back to the picking up a cup.\n\n3:01:17.060 --> 3:01:21.580\n Currently, a lot of things we do in war,\n\n3:01:21.580 --> 3:01:24.020\n like most of the drones that you hear about,\n\n3:01:24.020 --> 3:01:26.140\n they're not autonomous, not most, all.\n\n3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:27.340\n They're usually piloted by.\n\n3:01:27.340 --> 3:01:30.140\n They're piloted remotely by humans.\n\n3:01:30.140 --> 3:01:33.620\n And humans are really good at this kind of\n\n3:01:33.620 --> 3:01:35.700\n what's necessary to deliver the most damage,\n\n3:01:35.700 --> 3:01:39.340\n targeted damage, effective as part of the largest strategy\n\n3:01:39.340 --> 3:01:43.020\n you have about bombing the area or all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:01:43.020 --> 3:01:45.500\n I don't know how difficult that is to automate.\n\n3:01:45.500 --> 3:01:47.700\n I think the biggest concern,\n\n3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:51.620\n I actually have a sense that it's very difficult to automate.\n\n3:01:51.620 --> 3:01:53.840\n The biggest concern is almost like\n\n3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:56.060\n an incompetent application of this\n\n3:01:56.940 --> 3:02:01.140\n and consequences that are not anticipated.\n\n3:02:01.140 --> 3:02:05.000\n So you have a drone army where you say,\n\n3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:06.620\n we want to target,\n\n3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:09.580\n you give it power to target a particular terrorist.\n\n3:02:09.580 --> 3:02:12.140\n And then there's some bug in the system\n\n3:02:12.140 --> 3:02:15.860\n that has a, like for example,\n\n3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:18.820\n has a large uncertainty about the location of that terrorist.\n\n3:02:18.820 --> 3:02:21.000\n And so it decides to bomb an entire city.\n\n3:02:22.100 --> 3:02:25.140\n You know, almost like there's a bug, a software bug.\n\n3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:28.500\n I'm much more concerned about like bad programming\n\n3:02:28.500 --> 3:02:31.260\n and software engineering than I am about\n\n3:02:31.260 --> 3:02:36.180\n like malevolent AI systems that destroy the world.\n\n3:02:36.180 --> 3:02:38.720\n So the more we rely on automation,\n\n3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:40.160\n this is the lesson of human history.\n\n3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:45.160\n The more we give to AI, to software, to robotic systems,\n\n3:02:45.700 --> 3:02:49.700\n the more we forget how to supervise\n\n3:02:49.700 --> 3:02:52.180\n and oversee some of the edge cases,\n\n3:02:52.180 --> 3:02:54.500\n all the weird ways that things go wrong.\n\n3:02:54.500 --> 3:02:58.520\n And then the more stupid software bugs\n\n3:02:58.520 --> 3:02:59.880\n can lead to huge damage.\n\n3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:03.940\n Like, you know, even like nuclear explosions,\n\n3:03:03.940 --> 3:03:05.700\n those kinds of things.\n\n3:03:05.700 --> 3:03:09.680\n If we add AI into the launch systems\n\n3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:11.460\n for nuclear weapons, for example,\n\n3:03:13.260 --> 3:03:17.020\n I think human history teaches us that software bugs\n\n3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:21.060\n is what will lead to World War III,\n\n3:03:21.060 --> 3:03:25.740\n not malevolent AI or human beings.\n\n3:03:25.740 --> 3:03:26.820\n Interesting.\n\n3:03:26.820 --> 3:03:29.460\n By the way, I deeply appreciate how knowledgeable you are\n\n3:03:29.460 --> 3:03:31.260\n about the history of artificial intelligence.\n\n3:03:31.260 --> 3:03:32.100\n That was awesome.\n\n3:03:32.100 --> 3:03:33.640\n Oh no, it's fascinating stuff.\n\n3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:36.060\n You know, I remember reading when I was a child\n\n3:03:36.060 --> 3:03:38.580\n about, you know, Turing tests and things like this,\n\n3:03:38.580 --> 3:03:42.140\n and visionaries from the 1950s had ideas.\n\n3:03:42.140 --> 3:03:44.740\n To see it come this far is just so fascinating to me.\n\n3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:50.300\n Okay, so what can we as jiu jitsu players\n\n3:03:50.300 --> 3:03:51.300\n take away from this?\n\n3:03:51.300 --> 3:03:55.860\n We saw that when it comes to computers versus humans\n\n3:03:55.860 --> 3:03:57.620\n in chess tournaments,\n\n3:03:57.620 --> 3:04:01.140\n humans had something truly valuable\n\n3:04:01.140 --> 3:04:03.300\n to give to the computers.\n\n3:04:03.300 --> 3:04:04.980\n That was heuristic rules.\n\n3:04:05.980 --> 3:04:09.580\n In every coaching program that I run,\n\n3:04:09.580 --> 3:04:14.260\n I make an endless quest to search out\n\n3:04:14.260 --> 3:04:17.700\n and find effective heuristic rules.\n\n3:04:17.700 --> 3:04:20.060\n That's the basis of a good training program.\n\n3:04:21.020 --> 3:04:22.980\n Heuristic rules and principles\n\n3:04:24.420 --> 3:04:27.560\n give vast informational content,\n\n3:04:27.560 --> 3:04:30.820\n which can rapidly increase your performance on the mat,\n\n3:04:30.820 --> 3:04:33.100\n just as they rapidly increase the performance\n\n3:04:33.100 --> 3:04:37.180\n of chess computers to overcome their human adversaries.\n\n3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:43.660\n The great human weakness is computational power.\n\n3:04:43.660 --> 3:04:47.980\n Most people vastly overestimate their ability\n\n3:04:47.980 --> 3:04:51.460\n to reason and problem solve under stress.\n\n3:04:51.460 --> 3:04:54.360\n In fact, numerous psychological studies have shown\n\n3:04:54.360 --> 3:04:57.420\n that humans can balance a relatively small number\n\n3:04:57.420 --> 3:05:02.420\n of competing options in stressful decision making.\n\n3:05:03.820 --> 3:05:05.060\n But what we do have,\n\n3:05:05.060 --> 3:05:08.420\n what is the great and unique human gift\n\n3:05:09.540 --> 3:05:11.900\n is this idea to come up and arrive\n\n3:05:11.900 --> 3:05:14.160\n at heuristic rules and principles,\n\n3:05:14.160 --> 3:05:17.940\n which turn out to be very effective guides to behavior\n\n3:05:17.940 --> 3:05:19.460\n for both human behavior\n\n3:05:19.460 --> 3:05:21.660\n and artificially intelligent behavior.\n\n3:05:21.660 --> 3:05:26.500\n Make that your focus in study.\n\n3:05:27.460 --> 3:05:31.340\n Don't try to remember 10,000 different details on a move.\n\n3:05:31.340 --> 3:05:34.820\n Okay, that's human weakness, not human strength.\n\n3:05:34.820 --> 3:05:36.860\n Our strength is heuristics.\n\n3:05:36.860 --> 3:05:38.820\n Make that your focus,\n\n3:05:38.820 --> 3:05:42.860\n not endless computations over 25 details here\n\n3:05:42.860 --> 3:05:44.460\n merged with 27 details here.\n\n3:05:44.460 --> 3:05:46.500\n That's not what humans are good at.\n\n3:05:46.500 --> 3:05:51.300\n The uniquely human strength is arriving\n\n3:05:51.300 --> 3:05:53.260\n at these heuristic rules and principles\n\n3:05:53.260 --> 3:05:54.740\n which guide our behavior,\n\n3:05:54.740 --> 3:05:56.940\n which provides simplifications,\n\n3:05:56.940 --> 3:06:00.060\n which enable us to take vast amounts of information\n\n3:06:00.060 --> 3:06:02.140\n and parry it down to a few simple rules\n\n3:06:02.140 --> 3:06:04.340\n that effectively guide our behavior.\n\n3:06:04.340 --> 3:06:06.380\n Take that core insight from the discussion\n\n3:06:06.380 --> 3:06:07.380\n that Lex and I just had.\n\n3:06:07.380 --> 3:06:08.620\n It was a complex discussion.\n\n3:06:08.620 --> 3:06:10.900\n We both apologize for going a little bit overboard.\n\n3:06:10.900 --> 3:06:11.740\n That was awesome.\n\n3:06:11.740 --> 3:06:13.160\n Then dragging you into some details there,\n\n3:06:13.160 --> 3:06:14.000\n but take that away from it.\n\n3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:14.840\n I love it.\n\n3:06:14.840 --> 3:06:16.540\n It'll make you better at jujitsu.\n\n3:06:16.540 --> 3:06:17.380\n Sorry, Lex.\n\n3:06:18.580 --> 3:06:21.580\n That was a really exciting discussion,\n\n3:06:21.580 --> 3:06:25.060\n and the depths of knowledge\n\n3:06:25.060 --> 3:06:27.460\n in the dimensions of knowledge you have\n\n3:06:27.460 --> 3:06:30.100\n and interests you have is just fascinating.\n\n3:06:30.100 --> 3:06:32.940\n Is there advice you have for complete beginners,\n\n3:06:33.980 --> 3:06:36.460\n for white belts that are starting jujitsu,\n\n3:06:36.460 --> 3:06:37.380\n that are listening to this,\n\n3:06:37.380 --> 3:06:38.460\n that haven't done jujitsu?\n\n3:06:38.460 --> 3:06:39.620\n I know there's a lot of people\n\n3:06:39.620 --> 3:06:42.660\n who are super curious to start.\n\n3:06:42.660 --> 3:06:45.980\n Is there advice you would give them on their journey?\n\n3:06:45.980 --> 3:06:47.540\n Yeah, I'm just gonna talk about\n\n3:06:47.540 --> 3:06:50.140\n just getting better on the mat, okay?\n\n3:06:50.140 --> 3:06:51.300\n Because there's a thousand other things\n\n3:06:51.300 --> 3:06:54.220\n you can talk about in terms of morale and persistence\n\n3:06:54.220 --> 3:06:56.300\n and how often that you're trained\n\n3:06:56.300 --> 3:06:57.140\n is a thousand things you'd give.\n\n3:06:57.140 --> 3:06:59.340\n Break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend.\n\n3:06:59.340 --> 3:07:00.180\n That's one.\n\n3:07:00.180 --> 3:07:01.000\n I'm just kidding.\n\n3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:01.840\n Let's put that aside.\n\n3:07:02.920 --> 3:07:05.820\n That's probably the best advice we could give.\n\n3:07:05.820 --> 3:07:07.940\n It goes back to what we said earlier.\n\n3:07:07.940 --> 3:07:11.980\n I always advocate start your training from the ground up.\n\n3:07:11.980 --> 3:07:15.620\n Okay, your first sessions in jujitsu,\n\n3:07:15.620 --> 3:07:18.140\n you're going to find to your horror\n\n3:07:18.140 --> 3:07:21.380\n that everyone gets on top of you and you can't get out.\n\n3:07:21.380 --> 3:07:24.700\n And it's a dispiriting, crushing kind of feeling\n\n3:07:24.700 --> 3:07:26.340\n that you just have no skills\n\n3:07:26.340 --> 3:07:28.740\n and you have no prospects in the sport.\n\n3:07:28.740 --> 3:07:31.020\n So your first skill is the skill of being able\n\n3:07:31.020 --> 3:07:33.880\n to free yourself from positional pins.\n\n3:07:35.100 --> 3:07:38.980\n Most of the escapes in jujitsu go to guard position.\n\n3:07:38.980 --> 3:07:41.420\n And so once you get someone in your guard,\n\n3:07:41.420 --> 3:07:43.100\n they're going to be looking to pass your guard\n\n3:07:43.100 --> 3:07:45.120\n and get back into those positional pins\n\n3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:47.180\n that you just escaped from.\n\n3:07:47.180 --> 3:07:49.500\n And that's just as crushing as getting pinned.\n\n3:07:49.500 --> 3:07:51.500\n You feel like every time you try to hold someone in guard,\n\n3:07:51.500 --> 3:07:53.260\n they just effortlessly pass you by.\n\n3:07:54.300 --> 3:07:56.300\n So your first two skills,\n\n3:07:56.300 --> 3:07:58.120\n you got to be able to get out of any pin\n\n3:07:58.120 --> 3:08:00.220\n and you got to be able to hold someone in your guard.\n\n3:08:00.220 --> 3:08:02.280\n So pin escapes and guard retention\n\n3:08:02.280 --> 3:08:04.180\n are your first two skills.\n\n3:08:04.180 --> 3:08:08.740\n I generally advocate the idea of learning to fight\n\n3:08:08.740 --> 3:08:12.100\n from your back first and then learning to fight\n\n3:08:12.100 --> 3:08:13.720\n from on top second.\n\n3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:14.560\n Why?\n\n3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:16.920\n Because the brute fact is when you first start off,\n\n3:08:16.920 --> 3:08:19.300\n you just don't have enough skills to hold top position\n\n3:08:19.300 --> 3:08:21.460\n or gain top position through a takedown.\n\n3:08:21.460 --> 3:08:23.920\n So inevitably you're going to end up underneath people\n\n3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:25.880\n for most of your training time.\n\n3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:28.740\n Your training should reflect that in the early days\n\n3:08:28.740 --> 3:08:30.100\n as a white belt.\n\n3:08:30.100 --> 3:08:32.340\n Start with the first two skills you need.\n\n3:08:32.340 --> 3:08:33.500\n They're not the most exciting.\n\n3:08:33.500 --> 3:08:35.380\n They're not sexy skills that are going to make you look\n\n3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:36.780\n like a stud in the training room,\n\n3:08:36.780 --> 3:08:38.580\n but they're going to keep your life long enough\n\n3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:40.620\n to learn those sexy skills in the future\n\n3:08:40.620 --> 3:08:43.220\n that will make you look like a stud.\n\n3:08:43.220 --> 3:08:46.520\n Start with pin escapes, go to guard retention\n\n3:08:46.520 --> 3:08:49.420\n and focus heavily on those two.\n\n3:08:49.420 --> 3:08:51.460\n When you start to get into offense,\n\n3:08:51.460 --> 3:08:53.780\n start with bottom position.\n\n3:08:53.780 --> 3:08:56.940\n So there's a clear continuity between your pin escapes,\n\n3:08:56.940 --> 3:09:00.500\n your guard retention, and then your guard itself.\n\n3:09:00.500 --> 3:09:01.340\n Okay?\n\n3:09:01.340 --> 3:09:03.700\n You've got different options with guard.\n\n3:09:03.700 --> 3:09:05.180\n Some of you are going to like closed guard.\n\n3:09:05.180 --> 3:09:08.140\n Some of you are going to like variations of open guard.\n\n3:09:08.140 --> 3:09:09.420\n Some of you are going to like to be seated.\n\n3:09:09.420 --> 3:09:11.220\n Some of you are going to like to be supine.\n\n3:09:11.220 --> 3:09:13.580\n Some of you are going to like half guard.\n\n3:09:13.580 --> 3:09:17.300\n As a general rule, this is a heavy generalization,\n\n3:09:17.300 --> 3:09:18.940\n but I'm going to give it to you.\n\n3:09:18.940 --> 3:09:22.400\n In my experience, most people benefit the most\n\n3:09:22.400 --> 3:09:24.860\n by starting with half guard first.\n\n3:09:24.860 --> 3:09:27.100\n I know that traditionally Jiu Jitsu has been taught\n\n3:09:27.100 --> 3:09:28.220\n closed guard first,\n\n3:09:28.220 --> 3:09:30.900\n and then all the other guards come after that.\n\n3:09:30.900 --> 3:09:34.740\n I'm a big believer in the idea of start with pin escapes,\n\n3:09:34.740 --> 3:09:36.380\n then go to guard retention,\n\n3:09:36.380 --> 3:09:38.180\n and then start with half guard bottom.\n\n3:09:38.180 --> 3:09:39.740\n That way you get a nice continuity\n\n3:09:39.740 --> 3:09:41.540\n between your first three skills,\n\n3:09:41.540 --> 3:09:43.100\n and you'll make good progress\n\n3:09:43.100 --> 3:09:45.920\n over those first critical six months in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n3:09:46.860 --> 3:09:50.340\n What does it take to get a black belt in Jiu Jitsu?\n\n3:09:50.340 --> 3:09:51.740\n Very little.\n\n3:09:51.740 --> 3:09:52.580\n Ha ha ha.\n\n3:09:55.020 --> 3:09:56.940\n To show up, pay your fees.\n\n3:09:58.220 --> 3:10:00.300\n Don't set your goals low, okay?\n\n3:10:00.300 --> 3:10:01.900\n Don't even ask yourself that question.\n\n3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:03.820\n No one cares if you've got a black belt, okay?\n\n3:10:03.820 --> 3:10:06.060\n The only thing that counts is the skills you have.\n\n3:10:06.060 --> 3:10:09.260\n I know plenty of black belts that suck, okay?\n\n3:10:09.260 --> 3:10:10.860\n There's a lot of them out there.\n\n3:10:11.900 --> 3:10:13.900\n Don't lower your standards by saying,\n\n3:10:13.900 --> 3:10:15.300\n I want to get a black belt.\n\n3:10:16.260 --> 3:10:18.940\n Ask yourself something much more important.\n\n3:10:18.940 --> 3:10:20.780\n How good do I want to be?\n\n3:10:20.780 --> 3:10:21.940\n You want to be damn good, right?\n\n3:10:21.940 --> 3:10:23.060\n You want to do something in this time,\n\n3:10:23.060 --> 3:10:24.780\n and you want to be the best you can.\n\n3:10:24.780 --> 3:10:27.700\n Wearing a belt around your waist doesn't guarantee that.\n\n3:10:27.700 --> 3:10:29.540\n Build skills, focus on that.\n\n3:10:31.020 --> 3:10:33.540\n Let me ask you about the fourth thing\n\n3:10:33.540 --> 3:10:38.540\n in facet face of Jiu Jitsu, which is self defense.\n\n3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:42.060\n Let's say the bigger things,\n\n3:10:42.060 --> 3:10:44.780\n I don't know why it's called self defense.\n\n3:10:44.780 --> 3:10:46.780\n Let's call it street fighting.\n\n3:10:46.780 --> 3:10:49.420\n Let's call it fighting, okay?\n\n3:10:49.420 --> 3:10:51.580\n Maybe you can contest that terminology.\n\n3:10:51.580 --> 3:10:53.620\n How about non sport fighting?\n\n3:10:53.620 --> 3:10:54.860\n Non sport fighting.\n\n3:10:54.860 --> 3:10:55.980\n It's funny, like street fighting.\n\n3:10:55.980 --> 3:10:57.340\n What happens if you go out on a playground,\n\n3:10:57.340 --> 3:10:58.260\n and you're fighting on grass?\n\n3:10:58.260 --> 3:11:00.020\n Is there no longer street fighting?\n\n3:11:00.020 --> 3:11:00.860\n It's like tennis.\n\n3:11:00.860 --> 3:11:04.180\n You have like Wimbledon, like grass courts,\n\n3:11:04.180 --> 3:11:05.500\n it's a whole nother thing.\n\n3:11:07.500 --> 3:11:09.580\n What do you think is the best martial art\n\n3:11:09.580 --> 3:11:11.420\n for street fighting?\n\n3:11:11.420 --> 3:11:14.140\n What is the best set of,\n\n3:11:14.140 --> 3:11:16.620\n we talked about advice for white belts\n\n3:11:16.620 --> 3:11:21.620\n to advance in grappling in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n3:11:22.100 --> 3:11:24.540\n What is the set of techniques,\n\n3:11:24.540 --> 3:11:27.740\n maybe martial art that is best for street fighting?\n\n3:11:27.740 --> 3:11:31.260\n Okay, again, you're asking some\n\n3:11:31.260 --> 3:11:32.940\n truly fascinating questions here.\n\n3:11:37.620 --> 3:11:39.980\n The way this gets framed as a question\n\n3:11:39.980 --> 3:11:43.460\n is often condemns you to bad answers from the start.\n\n3:11:44.700 --> 3:11:46.420\n This is...\n\n3:11:46.420 --> 3:11:49.940\n As a questioner, I'm trying to achieve asymmetry of power.\n\n3:11:50.860 --> 3:11:51.740\n And I'm winning.\n\n3:11:53.940 --> 3:11:55.420\n Put you in a bad position.\n\n3:11:55.420 --> 3:11:58.020\n Don't worry so much about...\n\n3:11:58.020 --> 3:11:58.860\n People are always gonna say,\n\n3:11:58.860 --> 3:12:00.020\n you know, is this martial art better?\n\n3:12:00.020 --> 3:12:01.100\n Or is this martial arts better?\n\n3:12:01.100 --> 3:12:06.100\n The truth is there's only one way to say this.\n\n3:12:09.860 --> 3:12:14.860\n Combat sports are your best option for self defense.\n\n3:12:15.820 --> 3:12:17.460\n There are many martial arts,\n\n3:12:17.460 --> 3:12:20.820\n and there is a rough divide between the two.\n\n3:12:20.820 --> 3:12:22.700\n Those that fall into combat sports,\n\n3:12:22.700 --> 3:12:27.700\n and those that fall into non sporting martial arts,\n\n3:12:27.740 --> 3:12:32.740\n where there's no competitive live sparring element,\n\n3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:40.220\n where most of the knowledge is limited\n\n3:12:40.220 --> 3:12:44.180\n to theoretical knowledge reinforced by passive drilling.\n\n3:12:46.060 --> 3:12:48.900\n If you have a choice between a combat sport\n\n3:12:48.900 --> 3:12:52.940\n versus a non sporting art\n\n3:12:52.940 --> 3:12:55.500\n based around theoretical knowledge and passive drilling,\n\n3:12:55.500 --> 3:12:56.900\n go with a combat sport.\n\n3:12:58.300 --> 3:13:02.100\n Nothing will prepare you for the intensity\n\n3:13:04.540 --> 3:13:09.260\n of a genuine altercation better than combat sports.\n\n3:13:10.940 --> 3:13:13.060\n Many people, as I say these words,\n\n3:13:13.060 --> 3:13:15.980\n they're probably horrified to hear me say this,\n\n3:13:15.980 --> 3:13:19.500\n and immediately going to rebut and say,\n\n3:13:19.500 --> 3:13:23.140\n no, combat sports is exactly the wrong thing for you to do\n\n3:13:23.140 --> 3:13:26.620\n because they have safety rules, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n3:13:26.620 --> 3:13:30.260\n which would easily be exploited in a real fight.\n\n3:13:30.260 --> 3:13:32.620\n And if I fought a world championship boxer,\n\n3:13:32.620 --> 3:13:33.700\n I would just poke him in the eye\n\n3:13:33.700 --> 3:13:35.220\n or kick him in the groin, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:13:35.220 --> 3:13:38.220\n You've heard these arguments a thousand times.\n\n3:13:38.220 --> 3:13:40.940\n Yes, there is some validity to these things,\n\n3:13:40.940 --> 3:13:42.980\n but as a general rule,\n\n3:13:42.980 --> 3:13:47.420\n if you ask me to bet in any form of street fight,\n\n3:13:47.420 --> 3:13:48.500\n call it what you want,\n\n3:13:48.500 --> 3:13:52.260\n between a combat sport adherent\n\n3:13:52.260 --> 3:13:56.420\n versus someone who simply trains with drills\n\n3:13:56.420 --> 3:13:59.180\n and talks in terms of theories\n\n3:13:59.180 --> 3:14:00.940\n of what they would do in a fight,\n\n3:14:00.940 --> 3:14:04.620\n I'm gonna go with the combat sport guy every single time.\n\n3:14:05.700 --> 3:14:08.060\n Now, having said that,\n\n3:14:08.060 --> 3:14:11.660\n combat sports need to be modified\n\n3:14:11.660 --> 3:14:14.420\n for the use of self defense street fighting.\n\n3:14:14.420 --> 3:14:15.660\n We haven't agreed on a term yet.\n\n3:14:15.660 --> 3:14:16.980\n We'll figure it out later.\n\n3:14:18.460 --> 3:14:21.260\n What does this modification consist of?\n\n3:14:21.260 --> 3:14:23.540\n Well, some of it is technical, okay?\n\n3:14:23.540 --> 3:14:26.700\n For example, a boxer in a street fight\n\n3:14:27.900 --> 3:14:31.100\n now has to punch without wrapped or gloved hands,\n\n3:14:31.100 --> 3:14:32.660\n and that's problematic, okay?\n\n3:14:32.660 --> 3:14:35.460\n Your hands are not really designed\n\n3:14:35.460 --> 3:14:38.820\n for heavy extended use of clubbing hard objects.\n\n3:14:38.820 --> 3:14:41.620\n There's a very high likelihood of breaking your hands.\n\n3:14:41.620 --> 3:14:44.780\n Mike Tyson was one of the finest punchers that ever lived,\n\n3:14:44.780 --> 3:14:46.460\n but in one of his more famous street fights\n\n3:14:46.460 --> 3:14:50.100\n against Mitch Green in the late 1980s,\n\n3:14:50.100 --> 3:14:52.860\n he broke his hand with one punch\n\n3:14:52.860 --> 3:14:53.820\n that he threw at his opponent.\n\n3:14:53.820 --> 3:14:56.340\n He hit the wrong part of the head and broke his hand,\n\n3:14:56.340 --> 3:14:58.580\n and he was one of the most gifted punchers of all time.\n\n3:14:58.580 --> 3:14:59.780\n If he can do it,\n\n3:14:59.780 --> 3:15:02.980\n you'll certainly have trouble protecting your hands\n\n3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:04.300\n when you go to throw blows.\n\n3:15:06.740 --> 3:15:09.620\n Nonetheless, this was easily modified,\n\n3:15:09.620 --> 3:15:14.620\n and so a boxer can throw with open hands or with elbows,\n\n3:15:16.340 --> 3:15:19.460\n and so just a small modification and technique\n\n3:15:19.460 --> 3:15:21.940\n can overcome that problem.\n\n3:15:21.940 --> 3:15:26.220\n So what you'll find is that the general physical,\n\n3:15:26.220 --> 3:15:28.700\n mental conditioning, and skill development\n\n3:15:28.700 --> 3:15:30.420\n that comes from combat sports\n\n3:15:31.700 --> 3:15:36.220\n allied with technical modifications,\n\n3:15:36.220 --> 3:15:38.580\n and then the most important of all,\n\n3:15:38.580 --> 3:15:43.340\n tactical modifications will provide your best hope\n\n3:15:43.340 --> 3:15:47.260\n in altercations outside of sports in the street\n\n3:15:47.260 --> 3:15:49.260\n or wherever you find yourself.\n\n3:15:52.180 --> 3:15:55.420\n The least effective approaches to self defense\n\n3:15:55.420 --> 3:15:56.980\n that I have observed in my life\n\n3:15:56.980 --> 3:15:59.140\n have been those where, as I said,\n\n3:15:59.140 --> 3:16:04.140\n people talked theory, drilled on passive opponents,\n\n3:16:04.140 --> 3:16:08.740\n and generally had no engagement in live competition\n\n3:16:08.740 --> 3:16:11.300\n or sparring in their training programs.\n\n3:16:13.060 --> 3:16:16.180\n The most effective by a landslide\n\n3:16:16.180 --> 3:16:21.180\n were those that put a heavy emphasis on live sparring\n\n3:16:21.380 --> 3:16:26.140\n and sporting competition modified both technically\n\n3:16:26.140 --> 3:16:28.300\n and tactically for the circumstances\n\n3:16:28.300 --> 3:16:29.740\n in which they found themselves.\n\n3:16:30.740 --> 3:16:33.580\n People talk, for example, about how, you know,\n\n3:16:33.580 --> 3:16:37.500\n and with some validity that weapons\n\n3:16:37.500 --> 3:16:39.540\n will change everything in a street fight.\n\n3:16:39.540 --> 3:16:41.340\n There's absolute truth to that,\n\n3:16:41.340 --> 3:16:44.620\n but this extends into weapons as well, okay?\n\n3:16:44.620 --> 3:16:49.620\n The most effective forms of knife fighting that you'll see\n\n3:16:49.660 --> 3:16:53.140\n will be those who come from a background in fencing\n\n3:16:53.140 --> 3:16:56.900\n because it has sparring and a competitive sport aspect to it,\n\n3:16:56.900 --> 3:16:59.300\n but would pure fencing be the appropriate thing?\n\n3:16:59.300 --> 3:17:01.020\n Of course not, you'd have to modify it,\n\n3:17:01.020 --> 3:17:03.980\n but the reflexes, endurance, physical mobility\n\n3:17:03.980 --> 3:17:05.780\n that you gain from the sport of fencing\n\n3:17:05.780 --> 3:17:10.540\n could easily be modified to bladecraft in a fight situation.\n\n3:17:10.540 --> 3:17:14.740\n What you want to look for with regards street\n\n3:17:14.740 --> 3:17:18.340\n and self defense is not, okay, which style should I choose?\n\n3:17:18.340 --> 3:17:19.460\n Should I choose taekwondo?\n\n3:17:19.460 --> 3:17:20.420\n Should I choose karate?\n\n3:17:20.420 --> 3:17:22.460\n Should I choose this variation of kung fu?\n\n3:17:22.460 --> 3:17:24.980\n No, focus on the most important thing.\n\n3:17:24.980 --> 3:17:27.660\n Does it have a sport aspect to it?\n\n3:17:27.660 --> 3:17:30.060\n Then once you've made sufficient progress\n\n3:17:30.060 --> 3:17:32.180\n in the sport aspect of that martial art,\n\n3:17:32.180 --> 3:17:35.580\n start asking yourself, what are the requisite modifications\n\n3:17:35.580 --> 3:17:38.660\n and technique and tactics that I have to use\n\n3:17:38.660 --> 3:17:43.620\n or to input to make it effective for street situations?\n\n3:17:43.620 --> 3:17:45.620\n That's always the advice that I give.\n\n3:17:45.620 --> 3:17:47.580\n Let me zoom in on a very particular aspect\n\n3:17:47.580 --> 3:17:50.900\n of street fighting where, with all due respect,\n\n3:17:50.900 --> 3:17:54.700\n I disagree with Mr. Joe Rogan and George St. Pierre on,\n\n3:17:54.700 --> 3:17:57.140\n which is the suit and tie situation.\n\n3:17:57.140 --> 3:18:00.180\n Now, to criticize GSP, yeah, yeah,\n\n3:18:00.180 --> 3:18:01.540\n he's very accomplished and everything,\n\n3:18:01.540 --> 3:18:03.500\n but to criticize him for a bit,\n\n3:18:03.500 --> 3:18:07.300\n he made claims about how dangerous the tie is\n\n3:18:07.300 --> 3:18:09.020\n in a street fighting situation\n\n3:18:09.020 --> 3:18:12.780\n without ever having used it in a fighting situation.\n\n3:18:12.780 --> 3:18:15.980\n So he made sort of broad proclamations\n\n3:18:15.980 --> 3:18:18.460\n without understanding the fundamentals.\n\n3:18:18.460 --> 3:18:23.240\n So I thought I would go to somebody who thinks in systems.\n\n3:18:23.240 --> 3:18:28.240\n What do you think, is it dangerous to wear a tie\n\n3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:32.200\n or not in a grappling situation\n\n3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:33.040\n versus all the other weapons?\n\n3:18:33.040 --> 3:18:35.560\n Yeah, but we would do it in a street fight, yeah.\n\n3:18:35.560 --> 3:18:37.280\n It would be rather strange to wear a tie\n\n3:18:37.280 --> 3:18:38.480\n in a grappling competition.\n\n3:18:38.480 --> 3:18:40.520\n It would be, it would be.\n\n3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:42.480\n Yes, in a street fight situation.\n\n3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:43.320\n Okay, yeah.\n\n3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:47.680\n Joe Rogan thinks it is like the most dangerous,\n\n3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:50.360\n it's like it becomes your weakest point\n\n3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:52.960\n if you wear a tie because it's very easy to choke.\n\n3:18:52.960 --> 3:18:55.240\n George St. Pierre seemed to have agreed with that.\n\n3:18:55.240 --> 3:18:59.000\n Also, George added that you can grab the tie\n\n3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:03.120\n and pull the person down to a knee.\n\n3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:04.520\n Yeah, this is the go to.\n\n3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:06.040\n Joe Rogan will go for the choke,\n\n3:19:06.040 --> 3:19:08.720\n George St. Pierre will go for the tie to the knee,\n\n3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:10.600\n which I was saying is ridiculous.\n\n3:19:10.600 --> 3:19:11.560\n So what do you think?\n\n3:19:11.560 --> 3:19:15.100\n Okay, first off, I actually can speak with experience\n\n3:19:15.100 --> 3:19:17.820\n on this because I worked as a bouncer for over a decade\n\n3:19:17.820 --> 3:19:19.940\n and most of the clubs I worked at\n\n3:19:19.940 --> 3:19:21.480\n did not require a suit and tie,\n\n3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:22.780\n but occasionally they did.\n\n3:19:25.720 --> 3:19:27.360\n Okay, let's first differentiate\n\n3:19:27.360 --> 3:19:30.100\n between the kinds of threats when you wear a tie.\n\n3:19:30.100 --> 3:19:33.220\n If you wear a tie, if there is gonna be a threat,\n\n3:19:33.220 --> 3:19:36.540\n by far the more important threat is not strangulation.\n\n3:19:36.540 --> 3:19:40.240\n Okay, being strangled by your tie is possible,\n\n3:19:40.240 --> 3:19:42.100\n but it is a poor choice.\n\n3:19:42.100 --> 3:19:43.920\n There are many other ways to strangle people\n\n3:19:43.920 --> 3:19:45.160\n that are far more efficient.\n\n3:19:45.160 --> 3:19:49.320\n If I strangle by your tie, I'm literally in front of you.\n\n3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:52.400\n That means as I go to apply the strangle hold,\n\n3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:54.240\n I can easily be eye gouged, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:19:54.240 --> 3:19:56.200\n If you're gonna strangle people in the street,\n\n3:19:56.200 --> 3:19:59.200\n do it from behind and there's just much better ways\n\n3:19:59.200 --> 3:20:00.040\n to do it than that.\n\n3:20:00.040 --> 3:20:01.120\n Hear that, Joe Rogan?\n\n3:20:02.680 --> 3:20:04.840\n With regards to the snap down question,\n\n3:20:04.840 --> 3:20:07.280\n that is more a problem.\n\n3:20:07.280 --> 3:20:09.720\n I always recommend if you are going to work as a bouncer\n\n3:20:09.720 --> 3:20:12.820\n with a tie, wear a clip on tie\n\n3:20:12.820 --> 3:20:14.440\n so it just comes off immediately.\n\n3:20:14.440 --> 3:20:17.800\n If you don't like clip ons, then you can use a bow tie.\n\n3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:22.200\n I used to work for years in hip hop clubs\n\n3:20:22.200 --> 3:20:26.280\n with members of the Nation of Islam security team.\n\n3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:28.580\n They were known, they had various factions,\n\n3:20:28.580 --> 3:20:30.680\n but the one I worked with were the X Men,\n\n3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:32.280\n and they would always wear bow ties,\n\n3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:34.040\n which of course can't be grabbed.\n\n3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:39.040\n Now, the bow tie was a recognizable part of their brand\n\n3:20:40.920 --> 3:20:42.280\n as security guards, so everyone knew\n\n3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:43.880\n that that's what they wore.\n\n3:20:43.880 --> 3:20:46.960\n If I wore a bow tie in a security situation,\n\n3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:48.600\n people would probably think that I was some kind\n\n3:20:48.600 --> 3:20:52.440\n of Nancy boy and want to fight with me,\n\n3:20:52.440 --> 3:20:53.840\n so I couldn't wear one.\n\n3:20:53.840 --> 3:20:56.000\n So I would always wear a tie\n\n3:20:56.000 --> 3:21:00.120\n which you should become familiar with, Mr. Freeman.\n\n3:21:00.120 --> 3:21:04.960\n That's the Texas bolo tie, which is a kind of shoestring tie\n\n3:21:04.960 --> 3:21:07.080\n which is very, very thin, almost like shoestring\n\n3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:10.300\n and rather short and just has a simple pendant in the middle.\n\n3:21:11.160 --> 3:21:13.240\n This is perfect if you need to wear a tie\n\n3:21:13.240 --> 3:21:14.520\n in a situation where you believe\n\n3:21:14.520 --> 3:21:17.880\n there's a high likelihood of you being grabbed.\n\n3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:18.880\n Because it can't be grabbed.\n\n3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:19.840\n Yeah, there's nothing to grab.\n\n3:21:19.840 --> 3:21:20.960\n It's literally like string.\n\n3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:22.280\n Like if you pulled it,\n\n3:21:22.280 --> 3:21:24.320\n it would just slip through your hand.\n\n3:21:24.320 --> 3:21:26.760\n That tie that you're wearing now,\n\n3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:29.440\n that would give me tremendous control of your head,\n\n3:21:29.440 --> 3:21:32.800\n and I could easily turn it into a hockey fight situation\n\n3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:35.400\n where your head was being pulled down out of balance,\n\n3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:37.440\n and you would have a hard time recovering.\n\n3:21:38.560 --> 3:21:41.800\n So strangulation, not really a problem.\n\n3:21:41.800 --> 3:21:44.960\n Getting pulled down, possible problem.\n\n3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:48.480\n Solutions, clip on tie, bow tie,\n\n3:21:48.480 --> 3:21:50.720\n or if you don't want to look like a Nancy boy,\n\n3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:54.200\n wear a bolo tie.\n\n3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:55.880\n Beautiful, so you disagree with Joe Rogan,\n\n3:21:55.880 --> 3:21:58.280\n agree with George St. Pierre, I love it.\n\n3:21:58.280 --> 3:22:01.280\n I feel like this is an instruction we put together\n\n3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:06.280\n here on street fighting and the tie.\n\n3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:11.280\n Speaking of Joe Rogan, let me ask the following question.\n\n3:22:11.280 --> 3:22:15.000\n He's currently doing a podcast with Gordon Ryan,\n\n3:22:16.720 --> 3:22:20.880\n and probably going to try to convince him and you,\n\n3:22:20.880 --> 3:22:23.160\n as he's already been doing, to move to Austin.\n\n3:22:23.160 --> 3:22:27.600\n What are the chances of the Donoher Death Squad\n\n3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:30.960\n coming to Austin and opening a school in Austin\n\n3:22:30.960 --> 3:22:34.680\n and making Austin home so I can attend the classes there?\n\n3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:36.880\n I would definitely have to think about that.\n\n3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:41.880\n I do know that I personally love New York,\n\n3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:48.920\n but every single person in the squad despised New York\n\n3:22:49.240 --> 3:22:51.280\n and wanted to leave for a long time.\n\n3:22:54.440 --> 3:22:57.120\n What was the nature of your love for New York, by the way?\n\n3:22:57.120 --> 3:22:59.760\n It was truly an international city.\n\n3:22:59.760 --> 3:23:03.920\n I'm a big believer in the idea of breadth of experience,\n\n3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:07.520\n and if you want, breadth of experience\n\n3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:09.800\n usually requires extensive travel,\n\n3:23:09.800 --> 3:23:14.240\n but training people means you have to be in a fixed location\n\n3:23:14.240 --> 3:23:16.600\n working according to a schedule,\n\n3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:21.680\n and those two push in different directions.\n\n3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:23.000\n New York was the compromise\n\n3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:26.480\n where everyone from around the world came there\n\n3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:29.240\n so you had breadth of experience of world culture,\n\n3:23:29.240 --> 3:23:31.360\n but at the same time, you had a fixed location\n\n3:23:31.360 --> 3:23:32.840\n so you could run a training program\n\n3:23:32.840 --> 3:23:34.440\n that produced world champions,\n\n3:23:34.440 --> 3:23:36.080\n so it was the ideal compromise.\n\n3:23:37.520 --> 3:23:40.560\n It was a fascinating thing to teach classes\n\n3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:43.560\n of over 120 people where literally the entire world\n\n3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:45.200\n was represented on the map\n\n3:23:45.200 --> 3:23:48.840\n and go outside and see the same thing.\n\n3:23:48.840 --> 3:23:53.840\n It was truly the world's leading international city.\n\n3:23:54.160 --> 3:23:58.600\n It was like the world's unofficial capital,\n\n3:23:58.600 --> 3:24:00.640\n a fascinating place to live,\n\n3:24:00.640 --> 3:24:03.040\n so I loved it, but the squad hated it.\n\n3:24:03.040 --> 3:24:07.120\n For them, it was like an expensive thing.\n\n3:24:07.120 --> 3:24:08.760\n They never actually lived in Manhattan.\n\n3:24:08.760 --> 3:24:10.880\n They always lived in New Jersey or Long Island,\n\n3:24:10.880 --> 3:24:11.720\n had to commute in,\n\n3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:14.040\n so all they ever saw was the bridges and the tunnels,\n\n3:24:14.040 --> 3:24:16.640\n the expensive daily parking fees.\n\n3:24:16.640 --> 3:24:18.840\n They only saw the worst of New York,\n\n3:24:18.840 --> 3:24:22.600\n and despite my pleas for them to move into Manhattan,\n\n3:24:22.600 --> 3:24:25.640\n they never did, and so they hated it\n\n3:24:25.640 --> 3:24:27.320\n because when all you see of New York\n\n3:24:27.320 --> 3:24:28.560\n is the bridges and the tunnels\n\n3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:32.800\n and the parking garage, that's not a pleasant thing,\n\n3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:35.360\n so I understand where they're coming from,\n\n3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:37.880\n so then when COVID broke out,\n\n3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:44.760\n they wanted to move to Puerto Rico and work there.\n\n3:24:45.720 --> 3:24:50.120\n Now, Puerto Rico is a beautiful alternative to New York.\n\n3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.720\n In many ways, it has many advantages over New York.\n\n3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:53.840\n It's physically beautiful.\n\n3:24:53.840 --> 3:24:55.960\n The people are wonderful,\n\n3:24:55.960 --> 3:25:00.960\n and it's just a wonderful place to spend time.\n\n3:25:02.720 --> 3:25:06.360\n Freedom, low taxes, all those kinds of things\n\n3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:08.160\n that Puerto Rico stands for.\n\n3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:10.240\n It's Texas, on the other hand.\n\n3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:11.080\n I know everyone in the squad.\n\n3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:12.160\n It's a compromise, right?\n\n3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:14.200\n Texas is a compromise between those two.\n\n3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:17.000\n Actually, I must say that everyone on the squad,\n\n3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.320\n myself included, loves Texas.\n\n3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:21.760\n There's no question about that.\n\n3:25:21.760 --> 3:25:26.760\n I know Gordon loves it, Gary, Craig, Nicky,\n\n3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:29.680\n everyone who comes here just loves Texas.\n\n3:25:29.680 --> 3:25:31.320\n That is incontestable.\n\n3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:37.200\n Of course, in Texas, there's many great cities.\n\n3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:41.040\n Austin has always been one of my favorites.\n\n3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:43.240\n I love Dallas, I love Austin,\n\n3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:49.720\n and it has the advantages of better infrastructure\n\n3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:52.000\n as a place to train.\n\n3:25:52.000 --> 3:25:54.600\n It has a much higher population density\n\n3:25:54.600 --> 3:25:56.720\n so that you could get a larger number\n\n3:25:56.720 --> 3:25:59.120\n of prospective students and form a larger squad.\n\n3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:06.000\n It would definitely be a fantastic place to open up a gym.\n\n3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:09.080\n I couldn't give an answer off the top of my head.\n\n3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:11.600\n It would be a big move if we did make that move,\n\n3:26:12.520 --> 3:26:17.520\n but the basic idea would be very agreeable\n\n3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:19.520\n to everyone on the team, I will say that.\n\n3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:24.080\n Well, I'll just have to call on my Russian connections\n\n3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:25.600\n to threaten the right kind of people,\n\n3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:28.960\n and I definitely would love,\n\n3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:31.120\n the way you approach training,\n\n3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:32.880\n the way you approach the martial arts\n\n3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:37.400\n is something that I deeply admire\n\n3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:38.920\n as a scholar of these arts,\n\n3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:41.240\n so it would be amazing if you do come here,\n\n3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:44.440\n but either way, it'd be amazing to train together.\n\n3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:46.520\n Let me ask a big, ridiculous question.\n\n3:26:46.520 --> 3:26:51.520\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:55.800\n We talked about at the beginning of the conversation\n\n3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:59.040\n about death and the fear of it.\n\n3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:04.320\n The other big question we ask about life is its meaning.\n\n3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:07.080\n Do you think there's a meaning to our existence here\n\n3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:09.720\n on this little spinning ball?\n\n3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:13.600\n That's, you've thrown some powerful questions.\n\n3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:18.600\n That's the most powerful.\n\n3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:23.200\n For most of human existence,\n\n3:27:24.600 --> 3:27:29.280\n the meaning of life was very, very simple, survival.\n\n3:27:30.560 --> 3:27:35.480\n The only thing that humans cared about was just surviving\n\n3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:38.360\n because it was so damn difficult\n\n3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:43.360\n for the early years of human existence on this Earth.\n\n3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:48.720\n If you look at ourselves as biological agents,\n\n3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:52.040\n everything about our body is set up for one mission,\n\n3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:53.160\n and that is survival.\n\n3:27:54.040 --> 3:27:58.880\n Every reflex we have, every element of our structure\n\n3:27:58.880 --> 3:28:01.360\n is just built up on the battle to survive.\n\n3:28:03.320 --> 3:28:05.360\n And then humans did something remarkable.\n\n3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:10.360\n They elevated themselves through the use of technology\n\n3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:14.400\n and social structure to the top of the food chain\n\n3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:20.920\n so that they went from extremely vulnerable.\n\n3:28:20.920 --> 3:28:24.360\n If you take a naked human being alone\n\n3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:26.760\n and put them in the Serengeti Plains in Africa,\n\n3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:29.560\n they're in some deep shit.\n\n3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:33.120\n If you look at a human being as a survival organ,\n\n3:28:33.120 --> 3:28:38.120\n just by itself, naked, they are among the most feeble\n\n3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:41.640\n at that task in the entire animal kingdom.\n\n3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:49.560\n You compare us with predatory animals.\n\n3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:54.560\n We are weak and soft and easily killed.\n\n3:28:57.320 --> 3:29:01.320\n But if you take that same human and put them in the Serengeti\n\n3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:04.800\n human and put them in a group,\n\n3:29:04.800 --> 3:29:07.600\n and you give them basic technology,\n\n3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:12.600\n steel, a spear, a knife,\n\n3:29:14.360 --> 3:29:16.440\n he goes from the bottom of the food chain\n\n3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:19.080\n to pretty much at the top.\n\n3:29:20.760 --> 3:29:25.760\n And so humanity found itself in a crisis\n\n3:29:25.880 --> 3:29:28.680\n that emerged out of its own success.\n\n3:29:28.680 --> 3:29:31.360\n For most of its history, their only interest\n\n3:29:31.360 --> 3:29:33.520\n was the battle to survive, and they did it.\n\n3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:34.920\n I don't know how they did it, but they did it.\n\n3:29:34.920 --> 3:29:38.200\n They got through ice ages, droughts, famines,\n\n3:29:38.200 --> 3:29:40.920\n disease, everything, and they found a way\n\n3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:42.720\n to get to the top of the food chain.\n\n3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:47.760\n And that's where it all got interesting.\n\n3:29:47.760 --> 3:29:51.640\n Because an organism whose only interest was in survival\n\n3:29:51.640 --> 3:29:54.040\n had for the first time in their history\n\n3:29:54.040 --> 3:29:59.040\n a more or less guaranteed survival.\n\n3:29:59.400 --> 3:30:03.520\n And so the big question now is, now what?\n\n3:30:03.520 --> 3:30:04.760\n We survived.\n\n3:30:04.760 --> 3:30:06.280\n There's no more danger.\n\n3:30:06.280 --> 3:30:09.520\n The average human being finds himself in a world now\n\n3:30:09.520 --> 3:30:14.160\n where there's almost zero danger from predatory animals,\n\n3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:18.760\n where getting a meal is the easiest thing ever,\n\n3:30:18.760 --> 3:30:23.600\n where getting to and from work is not problematic at all,\n\n3:30:23.600 --> 3:30:27.880\n where the majority of infectious diseases,\n\n3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:31.280\n medical complaints can be resolved\n\n3:30:31.280 --> 3:30:33.160\n in a hospital fairly easily.\n\n3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:38.320\n And so they start casting their mind around,\n\n3:30:38.320 --> 3:30:40.360\n okay, what do I do now?\n\n3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:47.040\n And so the minute mankind's existence\n\n3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:48.920\n became more or less guaranteed,\n\n3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:53.920\n the problem shift from survival to meaning.\n\n3:30:55.440 --> 3:30:59.840\n And we found ourselves grappling with a whole new issue\n\n3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:02.400\n that had never occurred to our ancient forefathers,\n\n3:31:03.400 --> 3:31:06.600\n but which now becomes one of the centerpieces\n\n3:31:06.600 --> 3:31:07.840\n of our modern lives.\n\n3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:11.640\n I mean, when you look at your own life,\n\n3:31:11.640 --> 3:31:16.640\n when you look back, you think, I did a hell of a good job.\n\n3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:18.960\n You know, Hunter S. Thompson has this line\n\n3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:20.160\n that I often think about,\n\n3:31:21.480 --> 3:31:23.520\n that life should not be a journey to the grave\n\n3:31:23.520 --> 3:31:26.160\n with the intention of arriving safely\n\n3:31:26.160 --> 3:31:29.160\n in a pretty and well preserved body,\n\n3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:33.520\n but rather to skid in roadside in a cloud of smoke,\n\n3:31:33.520 --> 3:31:35.720\n thoroughly used up, totally worn out,\n\n3:31:35.720 --> 3:31:38.680\n and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride.\n\n3:31:38.680 --> 3:31:43.200\n Which is the complete opposite of survival.\n\n3:31:43.200 --> 3:31:45.800\n Well, not complete opposite of survival,\n\n3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:49.720\n but basically embracing danger, embracing risk,\n\n3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:53.120\n going big, just living life to the fullest.\n\n3:31:54.120 --> 3:31:55.960\n So within that context,\n\n3:31:57.760 --> 3:32:01.760\n what would make you proud of a life well lived?\n\n3:32:01.760 --> 3:32:03.640\n When you look back, you, John Donahart,\n\n3:32:03.640 --> 3:32:05.680\n looking back at your life.\n\n3:32:05.680 --> 3:32:07.520\n First, I will address that question,\n\n3:32:07.520 --> 3:32:11.120\n but let's first look at why Hunter Thompson could say that.\n\n3:32:11.120 --> 3:32:13.920\n Why Hunter Thompson could say that?\n\n3:32:13.920 --> 3:32:17.200\n Because his life was more or less guaranteed and safe.\n\n3:32:17.200 --> 3:32:20.120\n If you look at animals in the animal kingdom,\n\n3:32:20.120 --> 3:32:22.160\n the pattern of their life is very simple.\n\n3:32:22.160 --> 3:32:26.040\n They take the least risk possible to secure their existence.\n\n3:32:26.040 --> 3:32:29.880\n Lions are powerful creatures, but when they go hunting,\n\n3:32:29.880 --> 3:32:32.880\n they typically go for the weakest animals they can kill\n\n3:32:32.880 --> 3:32:33.720\n in order to eat,\n\n3:32:33.720 --> 3:32:34.880\n because they don't want to take the risk\n\n3:32:34.880 --> 3:32:38.600\n of injuring themselves, knowing that if they do, they die.\n\n3:32:38.600 --> 3:32:41.160\n So the brute reality is the only people\n\n3:32:41.160 --> 3:32:46.160\n who can talk about having casual danger in their lives\n\n3:32:46.920 --> 3:32:48.840\n are those whose lives are guaranteed.\n\n3:32:48.840 --> 3:32:51.520\n And a fascinating small tangent,\n\n3:32:51.520 --> 3:32:53.440\n Hunter Thompson took his own life.\n\n3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:58.120\n So that seems like a deeply human thing, suicide.\n\n3:32:58.120 --> 3:32:58.960\n Yes.\n\n3:33:00.560 --> 3:33:03.320\n That's a fascinating question in itself.\n\n3:33:03.320 --> 3:33:07.080\n If you look at the number of suicides per year,\n\n3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:09.000\n it's a shocking, shocking statistic\n\n3:33:09.000 --> 3:33:11.080\n that gets almost no recognition.\n\n3:33:11.080 --> 3:33:12.680\n And yes, uniquely human.\n\n3:33:12.680 --> 3:33:16.000\n You don't, very, very few animals, you see,\n\n3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:17.680\n killing themselves because their whole thing\n\n3:33:17.680 --> 3:33:18.800\n is just survival.\n\n3:33:18.800 --> 3:33:20.640\n And that humans paradoxically,\n\n3:33:20.640 --> 3:33:22.560\n when survival is more or less guaranteed,\n\n3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:24.640\n are killing themselves in vast numbers.\n\n3:33:24.640 --> 3:33:28.120\n It's usually linked back to the idea of meaning\n\n3:33:28.120 --> 3:33:30.480\n because it's so hard.\n\n3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:34.640\n It was hard to win the battle for survival,\n\n3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:37.600\n but it's 10 times harder to win the battle for meaning.\n\n3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:44.880\n When I think about it,\n\n3:33:44.880 --> 3:33:46.600\n first off, I'll say right from the bat,\n\n3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:51.600\n there's never going to be an agreed upon sense of meaning.\n\n3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:55.280\n As I said, there was one thing\n\n3:33:55.280 --> 3:33:57.880\n that our physical bodies agreed upon\n\n3:33:57.880 --> 3:34:00.600\n and which is hardwired biologically into us\n\n3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:01.760\n and that's survival.\n\n3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:05.000\n But once we got to a more or less guaranteed survival,\n\n3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:06.040\n then all bets were off.\n\n3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:09.400\n At that point, you just have to start\n\n3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:10.840\n listing your own criteria\n\n3:34:10.840 --> 3:34:13.360\n and what one person will describe as a meaningful life,\n\n3:34:13.360 --> 3:34:17.560\n another person will decry as meaningless or wasted.\n\n3:34:21.760 --> 3:34:24.760\n There's something terrible about the idea\n\n3:34:24.760 --> 3:34:27.440\n that we're sitting around waiting for meaning\n\n3:34:27.440 --> 3:34:29.200\n to show up on our doorstep.\n\n3:34:29.200 --> 3:34:30.960\n But what I find the best people do\n\n3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:32.040\n is they take charge of it\n\n3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:36.880\n and they look at their lives in a form of authorship\n\n3:34:36.880 --> 3:34:41.400\n where they see their life as a tale to be written\n\n3:34:41.400 --> 3:34:44.320\n and they do their best to write that tale\n\n3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:48.720\n and put as much control over the direction of the story\n\n3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:49.640\n as they can.\n\n3:34:52.520 --> 3:34:57.040\n In the end, we all have to just try and write our own story.\n\n3:34:57.040 --> 3:34:59.040\n We all have our own interests.\n\n3:34:59.040 --> 3:35:04.040\n I try to bring in the sense that even though I'm an atheist,\n\n3:35:05.800 --> 3:35:09.160\n I don't believe that we go on to live after this.\n\n3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:13.840\n I believe that there's a possibility of God in an afterlife.\n\n3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:15.520\n I don't say it's impossible,\n\n3:35:15.520 --> 3:35:18.440\n but in order for me to believe that they exist,\n\n3:35:18.440 --> 3:35:21.200\n I'd have to see better evidence than I see currently.\n\n3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:26.840\n Nonetheless, I do believe that there is a great value\n\n3:35:26.840 --> 3:35:31.160\n in the idea of living for something bigger than yourself.\n\n3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:34.520\n The moment you see yourself as the be all\n\n3:35:34.520 --> 3:35:36.400\n and end all of your existence,\n\n3:35:36.400 --> 3:35:38.200\n you're in for a meaningless life\n\n3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:40.200\n and nothing will ever satisfy you.\n\n3:35:40.200 --> 3:35:41.600\n You can have all the money in the world.\n\n3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:42.800\n You can have all the power in the world.\n\n3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:44.160\n You'll be empty inside.\n\n3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:49.920\n I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need\n\n3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:53.880\n to follow the interests of a group\n\n3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:57.440\n bigger than themselves as an individual.\n\n3:35:57.440 --> 3:35:58.440\n Is it ideal?\n\n3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.280\n No.\n\n3:35:59.280 --> 3:36:00.920\n Is it an answer to the meaning of life?\n\n3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:03.520\n Nope, because eventually that group will itself die out.\n\n3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:06.640\n So there's a sense in which it just plays\n\n3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:07.880\n a kind of delaying game.\n\n3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:15.680\n But I do believe that in order to live a happy life,\n\n3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:19.280\n meaning is a central part of that.\n\n3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:21.080\n And the deepest sense of meaning,\n\n3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:24.720\n not a fully complete answer, but a better answer\n\n3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:28.200\n than most people give is to find something\n\n3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:31.400\n which hopefully does very little harm\n\n3:36:31.400 --> 3:36:34.720\n to the people around you and mostly benefits them,\n\n3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:38.440\n which enables you to become part of a community\n\n3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:42.000\n and to live, as I said,\n\n3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.880\n for something larger than you as an individual.\n\n3:36:46.960 --> 3:36:50.080\n If there is such a thing as a perfect conversation,\n\n3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:55.080\n it would be a conversation on death, meaning, and robots\n\n3:36:56.920 --> 3:36:58.920\n with the great John Donoher.\n\n3:36:58.920 --> 3:37:00.600\n John, I've been a fan.\n\n3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:04.560\n It's a huge honor that you would waste all your time today.\n\n3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:05.720\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n3:37:05.720 --> 3:37:06.560\n My pleasure.\n\n3:37:06.560 --> 3:37:08.040\n Thank you, Lynx.\n\n3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:09.560\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:37:09.560 --> 3:37:12.640\n with John Donoher, and thank you to Onnit,\n\n3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:15.720\n SimplySafe, Indeed, and Linode.\n\n3:37:15.720 --> 3:37:19.200\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:21.320\n And now let me leave you some words\n\n3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:23.560\n from John Donoher himself.\n\n3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:27.800\n In fighting and competition, the objective is victory.\n\n3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:31.280\n In training, the objective is skill development.\n\n3:37:31.280 --> 3:37:33.080\n Do not confuse them.\n\n3:37:33.080 --> 3:37:35.160\n As such, one of the best ways to train\n\n3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:38.600\n is to identify the strengths of your various partners\n\n3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:41.600\n and regularly expose yourself to those strengths.\n\n3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:53.600\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
