00:08.600\n at Arizona State University and the Santa Fe Institute.\n\n00:08.600 --> 00:10.960\n She's interested in the origin of life,\n\n00:10.960 --> 00:13.520\n how to find life on other worlds,\n\n00:13.520 --> 00:15.880\n and in general, the more fundamental question\n\n00:15.880 --> 00:18.160\n of what even life is.\n\n00:18.160 --> 00:20.260\n She seeks to discover the universal laws\n\n00:20.260 --> 00:23.400\n that describe living systems on Earth and elsewhere\n\n00:23.400 --> 00:26.440\n using physics, biology, and computation.\n\n00:26.440 --> 00:30.360\n Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens,\n\n00:30.360 --> 00:33.380\n NetSuite, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.\n\n00:33.380 --> 00:36.280\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:36.280 --> 00:39.400\n As a side note, let me say that my hope for this podcast\n\n00:39.400 --> 00:42.120\n is to try and alternate between technical\n\n00:42.120 --> 00:44.040\n and nontechnical discussions,\n\n00:44.040 --> 00:45.720\n to jump from the big picture\n\n00:45.720 --> 00:48.040\n down to specific detailed research\n\n00:48.040 --> 00:49.800\n and back to the big picture,\n\n00:49.800 --> 00:53.720\n and to do so with scientists and non scientists.\n\n00:53.720 --> 00:56.360\n Long term, I hope to alternate between discussions\n\n00:56.360 --> 00:59.920\n of cutting edge research in AI, physics, biology,\n\n00:59.920 --> 01:03.280\n to topics of music, sport, and history,\n\n01:03.280 --> 01:05.360\n and then back to AI.\n\n01:05.360 --> 01:06.700\n AI is home.\n\n01:06.700 --> 01:08.280\n I hope you come along with me\n\n01:08.280 --> 01:11.520\n for that wild, oscillating journey.\n\n01:11.520 --> 01:14.360\n Some people message me saying to slow down\n\n01:14.360 --> 01:15.440\n since they're falling behind\n\n01:15.440 --> 01:17.780\n on the episodes of this podcast.\n\n01:17.780 --> 01:19.980\n To their disappointment, I have to say\n\n01:19.980 --> 01:22.560\n that I'll probably do more episodes, not less,\n\n01:22.560 --> 01:25.600\n but you really don't need to listen to every episode.\n\n01:25.600 --> 01:28.540\n Just listen to the ones that spark your curiosity.\n\n01:28.540 --> 01:30.720\n Think about it like a party full of strangers.\n\n01:30.720 --> 01:32.760\n You don't have to talk to everyone.\n\n01:32.760 --> 01:34.840\n Just walk over to the ones who look interesting\n\n01:34.840 --> 01:36.320\n and get to know them.\n\n01:36.320 --> 01:39.400\n And if you're lucky, that one conversation with a stranger\n\n01:39.400 --> 01:41.680\n might change the direction of your life.\n\n01:41.680 --> 01:44.280\n And it's a short life, so be picky with the strangers\n\n01:44.280 --> 01:47.560\n you talk to at this metaphorical party.\n\n01:47.560 --> 01:49.560\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n01:49.560 --> 01:52.560\n and here is my conversation with Sarah Walker.\n\n01:52.560 --> 01:55.640\n How did life originate on Earth?\n\n01:55.640 --> 01:57.480\n What are the various hypotheses\n\n01:57.480 --> 02:00.000\n for how life originated on Earth?\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.140\n Yeah, so I guess you're asking a historical question,\n\n02:03.140 --> 02:06.880\n which is always a good place to start thinking about life.\n\n02:06.880 --> 02:10.640\n So there's a lot of ideas about how life started on Earth.\n\n02:10.640 --> 02:11.840\n Probably the most popular\n\n02:11.840 --> 02:15.520\n is what's called the RNA world scenario.\n\n02:15.520 --> 02:17.920\n So this idea is probably the one\n\n02:17.920 --> 02:20.020\n that you'll see most reported in the news.\n\n02:20.020 --> 02:25.020\n And is based on the idea that there are molecules\n\n02:27.260 --> 02:31.620\n in our bodies that relay genetic information.\n\n02:31.620 --> 02:33.420\n And we know those as DNA, obviously,\n\n02:33.420 --> 02:37.080\n but there's also a sort of an intermediary called RNA,\n\n02:37.080 --> 02:41.220\n ribonucleic acid, that also plays the role of proteins.\n\n02:41.220 --> 02:44.740\n And people came up with this idea in the 80s\n\n02:44.740 --> 02:47.180\n that maybe that was the first genetic material\n\n02:47.180 --> 02:50.180\n because it could play both roles of being genetic\n\n02:50.180 --> 02:52.380\n and performing catalysis.\n\n02:52.380 --> 02:55.520\n And then somehow that idea got reduced to this idea\n\n02:55.520 --> 02:59.300\n that there was a molecule that emerged on early Earth\n\n02:59.300 --> 03:01.640\n and underwent Darwinian evolution,\n\n03:01.640 --> 03:03.340\n and that was the start of life.\n\n03:03.340 --> 03:06.380\n So there's a lot of assumptions packed in there\n\n03:06.380 --> 03:08.340\n that we could unpack,\n\n03:08.340 --> 03:10.240\n but that's sort of the leading hypothesis.\n\n03:10.240 --> 03:13.260\n There's also other ideas about life starting as metabolism.\n\n03:13.260 --> 03:14.660\n And so that's more connected\n\n03:14.660 --> 03:17.380\n to the geochemistry of early Earth.\n\n03:17.380 --> 03:19.560\n And it would be kind of more focused on this idea\n\n03:19.560 --> 03:22.720\n that you get some kind of catalytic cycle of molecules\n\n03:22.720 --> 03:24.060\n that can reproduce themselves\n\n03:24.060 --> 03:25.860\n and form some kind of metabolism.\n\n03:25.860 --> 03:28.340\n And then life starts basically a self organization.\n\n03:28.340 --> 03:31.280\n And then you have to explain how evolution comes later.\n\n03:31.280 --> 03:32.700\n Right, so that's the difference\n\n03:32.700 --> 03:35.700\n between sort of energy and genetic code.\n\n03:35.700 --> 03:37.460\n So like energy and information\n\n03:37.460 --> 03:39.620\n are those are the two kind of things there?\n\n03:39.620 --> 03:41.140\n Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.\n\n03:41.140 --> 03:43.420\n It's kind of funny,\n\n03:43.420 --> 03:44.820\n because I think most of the people that think about\n\n03:44.820 --> 03:46.780\n these things are really disciplinary bias.\n\n03:46.780 --> 03:48.500\n So the people that tend to think about genetics\n\n03:48.500 --> 03:49.780\n come from a biology background\n\n03:49.780 --> 03:51.620\n and they're really evolution focused.\n\n03:51.620 --> 03:52.940\n And so they're worried about\n\n03:52.940 --> 03:54.580\n where does the information come from?\n\n03:54.580 --> 03:55.800\n And how does it change over time?\n\n03:55.800 --> 03:57.880\n But they're talking about information in a really narrow way\n\n03:57.880 --> 04:00.420\n where they're talking about a genetic sequence.\n\n04:00.420 --> 04:03.980\n And then most of the people that think about metabolism,\n\n04:03.980 --> 04:06.140\n origins of life scenarios tend to be\n\n04:06.140 --> 04:07.940\n people like physicists or geochemists\n\n04:07.940 --> 04:09.580\n that are worried about what are the energy sources\n\n04:09.580 --> 04:11.900\n and what kinds of organization\n\n04:11.900 --> 04:14.100\n can you get out of those energy sources?\n\n04:14.100 --> 04:15.880\n Okay, so which one is your favorite?\n\n04:15.880 --> 04:17.460\n I don't like either.\n\n04:17.460 --> 04:19.220\n Okay, all right, can we talk about them\n\n04:19.220 --> 04:20.060\n for a little bit longer though?\n\n04:20.060 --> 04:21.420\n Yeah, no, that's fine.\n\n04:23.700 --> 04:26.020\n So okay, so there's early Earth.\n\n04:26.020 --> 04:27.000\n What was that like?\n\n04:27.000 --> 04:29.220\n Was there just mostly covered by oceans?\n\n04:29.220 --> 04:31.700\n Was there heat sources, energy sources?\n\n04:31.700 --> 04:35.260\n So if we talk about the metabolism view\n\n04:35.260 --> 04:36.500\n of the origin of life,\n\n04:36.500 --> 04:38.380\n like where was the source of energy?\n\n04:38.380 --> 04:39.700\n Probably the most popular view\n\n04:39.700 --> 04:42.220\n for where the origin of life happened on Earth\n\n04:42.220 --> 04:45.500\n is hydrothermal vents because they had sufficient energy.\n\n04:45.500 --> 04:50.180\n And so we don't really know a lot about early Earth.\n\n04:50.180 --> 04:53.420\n We have some ideas about when oceans first formed\n\n04:53.420 --> 04:54.260\n and things like that,\n\n04:54.260 --> 04:55.440\n but the time of the origin of life\n\n04:55.440 --> 04:59.100\n is kind of not well understood or pinned down\n\n04:59.100 --> 05:02.240\n and the conditions on Earth at that time are not well known.\n\n05:02.240 --> 05:03.580\n But a lot of people do think\n\n05:03.580 --> 05:05.600\n that there was probably hydrothermal vents\n\n05:05.600 --> 05:10.020\n which are really hot, chemically active regions,\n\n05:10.020 --> 05:12.660\n say on the seafloor in modern times,\n\n05:12.660 --> 05:14.740\n which also would have been present on early Earth.\n\n05:14.740 --> 05:17.960\n And they would have provided energy and organics\n\n05:17.960 --> 05:20.180\n and basically all of the right conditions\n\n05:20.180 --> 05:22.420\n for the origins of life,\n\n05:22.420 --> 05:23.260\n which is one of the reasons\n\n05:23.260 --> 05:24.820\n that we look for these hydrothermal systems\n\n05:24.820 --> 05:27.300\n when we're talking about life elsewhere too.\n\n05:27.300 --> 05:30.020\n Okay, and for the genetic code,\n\n05:30.020 --> 05:32.180\n the idea is that the RNA is the first,\n\n05:32.180 --> 05:37.180\n like why would RNA be the first moment you can say it's life?\n\n05:37.620 --> 05:39.500\n I guess the idea is it could both\n\n05:40.500 --> 05:42.080\n have persistent information\n\n05:42.940 --> 05:45.140\n and then it can also do some of the work\n\n05:45.140 --> 05:49.100\n of like what, creating a self sustaining organism?\n\n05:49.100 --> 05:50.940\n Yeah, that's the basic idea.\n\n05:50.940 --> 05:54.580\n So the idea is you have, in an RNA molecule,\n\n05:54.580 --> 05:56.340\n you have a sequence of characters, say,\n\n05:56.340 --> 05:58.820\n so you can treat it like a string in a computer\n\n05:58.820 --> 06:00.060\n and it can be copied.\n\n06:00.060 --> 06:02.780\n So information can be propagated,\n\n06:02.780 --> 06:06.000\n which is important for evolution\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:07.380\n because evolution happens\n\n06:07.380 --> 06:09.580\n by having inheritance of information.\n\n06:09.580 --> 06:11.620\n So for example, like my eyes are brown\n\n06:11.620 --> 06:13.900\n because my mother's eyes were brown.\n\n06:13.900 --> 06:16.180\n So you need that copying of information,\n\n06:16.180 --> 06:21.180\n but then you also have the ability to perform catalysis,\n\n06:22.020 --> 06:24.400\n which means that that RNA molecule\n\n06:24.400 --> 06:26.040\n is not inert in that environment,\n\n06:26.040 --> 06:27.980\n but it actually interacts with something\n\n06:27.980 --> 06:31.260\n and could potentially mediate, say, a metabolism\n\n06:31.260 --> 06:33.980\n that could then fuel the actual reproduction\n\n06:33.980 --> 06:35.380\n of that molecule.\n\n06:35.380 --> 06:40.100\n So in some ways, people think that RNA gives you\n\n06:42.140 --> 06:44.480\n the most bang for your buck in a single molecule\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:47.180\n and therefore, it gives you all the features\n\n06:47.180 --> 06:48.900\n that you might think are life.\n\n06:49.820 --> 06:52.300\n And so this is sort of where this RNA world conjecture\n\n06:52.300 --> 06:54.540\n came from is because of those two properties.\n\n06:54.540 --> 06:59.100\n Isn't it amazing that RNA came to be in general?\n\n06:59.100 --> 07:01.100\n Isn't it? Yes, that is amazing.\n\n07:01.100 --> 07:03.660\n Okay, so we're not talking down about RNA.\n\n07:03.660 --> 07:04.820\n No, no, I love RNA.\n\n07:04.820 --> 07:06.180\n It's one of my favorite molecules.\n\n07:06.180 --> 07:08.700\n I think it's beautiful. It's just not step one.\n\n07:08.700 --> 07:10.800\n Yeah, I think the issue,\n\n07:10.800 --> 07:12.980\n it's not even the RNA world is a problem\n\n07:12.980 --> 07:16.820\n and actually, if you really dig into it,\n\n07:16.820 --> 07:19.340\n the RNA world is not one hypothesis.\n\n07:19.340 --> 07:22.260\n It is a set of hypothesis, hypotheses, sorry.\n\n07:22.260 --> 07:27.260\n And they range from a molecule of RNA spontaneously emerged\n\n07:27.380 --> 07:29.740\n on the early Earth and started evolving,\n\n07:29.740 --> 07:31.820\n which is kind of like the hardest RNA world scenario,\n\n07:31.820 --> 07:36.620\n which is the one I cited and I get a little animated about\n\n07:36.620 --> 07:39.320\n because it seems so blatantly wrong to me,\n\n07:39.320 --> 07:40.700\n but that's a separate story.\n\n07:40.700 --> 07:43.140\n And then the other one is actually something I agree with,\n\n07:43.140 --> 07:46.500\n which is that you can say there was an RNA world\n\n07:46.500 --> 07:49.180\n because RNA was the first genetic material\n\n07:49.180 --> 07:50.340\n for life on Earth.\n\n07:50.340 --> 07:54.700\n So an RNA world could just be the earliest organisms\n\n07:54.700 --> 07:57.500\n that had genetics in a modern sense,\n\n07:57.500 --> 08:01.100\n didn't have DNA evolved yet, they had RNA, right?\n\n08:01.100 --> 08:03.780\n And so that's sort of a softer RNA world scenario\n\n08:03.780 --> 08:06.020\n in the sense that it doesn't mean it was the first thing\n\n08:06.020 --> 08:10.420\n that happened, but it was a thing that definitely was part\n\n08:10.420 --> 08:12.780\n of the lineage of events that led to us.\n\n08:12.780 --> 08:16.280\n So if a life was like a best of album,\n\n08:16.280 --> 08:18.820\n it would be on the, it'd be one of the songs on there.\n\n08:18.820 --> 08:19.860\n Yes. One of the early songs.\n\n08:19.860 --> 08:20.700\n Okay.\n\n08:20.700 --> 08:21.660\n It's on the greatest hits.\n\n08:21.660 --> 08:23.740\n Greatest hits, that's the word I was looking for.\n\n08:23.740 --> 08:24.580\n Okay.\n\n08:24.580 --> 08:28.820\n Did life, do you think, originate once, twice,\n\n08:28.820 --> 08:30.740\n three times on Earth, multiple times?\n\n08:30.740 --> 08:31.780\n What do you think?\n\n08:31.780 --> 08:33.860\n I think that's a really difficult question.\n\n08:33.860 --> 08:35.460\n Is it an important question?\n\n08:35.460 --> 08:36.700\n It's a super important question.\n\n08:36.700 --> 08:39.500\n No, it's a really important question.\n\n08:39.500 --> 08:44.500\n And so there's a lot of questions in that question.\n\n08:45.500 --> 08:48.580\n So one of the first ones that I think needs to be addressed\n\n08:48.580 --> 08:50.940\n is is the origin of life a continuous process\n\n08:50.940 --> 08:52.020\n on our planet?\n\n08:52.020 --> 08:54.380\n So we think about the origin of life as something\n\n08:54.380 --> 08:58.180\n that happened on Earth, say almost 4 billion years ago,\n\n08:58.180 --> 09:00.620\n because we have evidence of life emerging very early\n\n09:00.620 --> 09:01.480\n on our planet.\n\n09:02.700 --> 09:06.100\n And then an origin of life event, quote unquote,\n\n09:06.100 --> 09:08.620\n a singular event, whatever that was, happened.\n\n09:08.620 --> 09:12.740\n And then all life on Earth that we know is a descendant\n\n09:12.740 --> 09:14.780\n of that particular event in our universe, right?\n\n09:14.780 --> 09:19.780\n And so, but we don't have any idea one way or the other\n\n09:21.940 --> 09:25.020\n if the origin of life is happening repeatedly,\n\n09:25.020 --> 09:26.300\n and maybe it's just not taking off\n\n09:26.300 --> 09:27.660\n because life is already established.\n\n09:27.660 --> 09:29.540\n That's a argument that people will make,\n\n09:29.540 --> 09:33.140\n or maybe there are alternative forms of life on Earth\n\n09:33.140 --> 09:35.340\n that we don't even recognize.\n\n09:35.340 --> 09:36.860\n So this is the idea of a shadow biosphere\n\n09:36.860 --> 09:38.060\n that there actually might just be\n\n09:38.060 --> 09:39.500\n completely other life on Earth,\n\n09:39.500 --> 09:42.940\n but it's so alien that we don't even know what it is.\n\n09:42.940 --> 09:45.380\n I'm gonna have to talk to you about the shadow biosphere.\n\n09:45.380 --> 09:46.420\n Yeah, that's a fun one.\n\n09:46.420 --> 09:49.740\n In a second, but first, let me ask for the other alternative,\n\n09:49.740 --> 09:51.400\n which is panspermia.\n\n09:51.400 --> 09:52.240\n Right.\n\n09:52.240 --> 09:55.300\n So that's the idea, the hypothesis that life exists\n\n09:55.300 --> 09:57.300\n elsewhere in the universe and got to us\n\n09:57.300 --> 09:59.860\n through like an asteroid or a planetoid\n\n09:59.860 --> 10:02.660\n or some, according to Wikipedia, space dust,\n\n10:02.660 --> 10:03.960\n whatever the heck that is.\n\n10:05.380 --> 10:06.220\n It sounds fun.\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:10.240\n But basically, it rode along whatever kind of rock\n\n10:10.240 --> 10:11.820\n and got to us.\n\n10:11.820 --> 10:15.020\n Do you think that's at all a possibility?\n\n10:15.020 --> 10:15.860\n Sure.\n\n10:15.860 --> 10:19.100\n So I think the reason that most original life scientists\n\n10:19.100 --> 10:20.820\n are interested in the original life on Earth\n\n10:20.820 --> 10:25.040\n and say not the original life on Mars\n\n10:25.040 --> 10:26.980\n and then panspermia,\n\n10:26.980 --> 10:29.380\n the exchange of life between planets being the explanation\n\n10:29.380 --> 10:32.020\n is once you start removing the original life from Earth,\n\n10:32.020 --> 10:33.780\n you know even less about it\n\n10:33.780 --> 10:36.060\n than you do if you study it on Earth.\n\n10:36.060 --> 10:37.740\n Although, I think there are ways\n\n10:37.740 --> 10:38.780\n of reformulating the problem.\n\n10:38.780 --> 10:40.460\n This is why I said earlier,\n\n10:40.460 --> 10:42.460\n oh, you mean the historical original life problem.\n\n10:42.460 --> 10:44.980\n You don't mean the problem of how does life arise\n\n10:44.980 --> 10:47.340\n in the universe and what the universal principles are\n\n10:47.340 --> 10:48.780\n because there's this historic problem,\n\n10:48.780 --> 10:50.420\n how did it happen on early Earth?\n\n10:50.420 --> 10:53.140\n And there's a more tractable general problem\n\n10:53.140 --> 10:54.300\n of how does it happen?\n\n10:55.180 --> 10:57.260\n And how does it happen is something we can actually ask\n\n10:57.260 --> 10:58.100\n in the lab.\n\n10:58.100 --> 11:00.740\n How did it happen on early Earth\n\n11:00.740 --> 11:04.220\n is a much more detailed and nuanced question\n\n11:04.220 --> 11:06.500\n and requires detailed knowledge of what was happening\n\n11:06.500 --> 11:08.980\n on early Earth that we don't have.\n\n11:08.980 --> 11:11.380\n And I'm personally more interested in general mechanisms.\n\n11:11.380 --> 11:13.180\n So to me, it doesn't matter if it happened on Earth\n\n11:13.180 --> 11:15.140\n or it happened on Mars.\n\n11:15.140 --> 11:16.700\n It just matters that it happened.\n\n11:16.700 --> 11:18.520\n We have evidence it happened.\n\n11:18.520 --> 11:20.220\n The question is, did it happen more than once\n\n11:20.220 --> 11:21.340\n in our universe?\n\n11:21.340 --> 11:24.260\n And so the reason I don't find panspermia\n\n11:24.260 --> 11:25.940\n as a particularly,\n\n11:25.940 --> 11:28.740\n I think it's a fascinating hypothesis.\n\n11:28.740 --> 11:30.980\n I definitely think it's possible.\n\n11:30.980 --> 11:33.820\n And I in particular think it's possible\n\n11:33.820 --> 11:36.140\n once you get to the stage of life where you have technology\n\n11:36.140 --> 11:38.580\n because then you obviously can spread out\n\n11:38.580 --> 11:40.220\n into the cosmos.\n\n11:40.220 --> 11:41.940\n But it's also possible for microbes\n\n11:41.940 --> 11:45.420\n because we know that certain microorganisms\n\n11:45.420 --> 11:47.020\n can survive the journey in space.\n\n11:47.020 --> 11:50.940\n And they can live in a rock and go between Mars and Earth.\n\n11:50.940 --> 11:51.940\n Like people have done experiments\n\n11:51.940 --> 11:54.140\n to try to prove that could work.\n\n11:54.140 --> 11:57.100\n So in that scenario, it's super cool\n\n11:57.100 --> 11:58.340\n because then you get planetary exchange,\n\n11:58.340 --> 12:00.560\n but say we go look for life on Mars\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:02.780\n and it ends up being exactly the same life we have on Earth,\n\n12:02.780 --> 12:04.340\n biochemically speaking,\n\n12:04.340 --> 12:05.740\n then we haven't really discovered something new\n\n12:05.740 --> 12:06.980\n about the universe.\n\n12:06.980 --> 12:08.620\n What kind of aliens are possible\n\n12:08.620 --> 12:10.780\n were there other origin of life events?\n\n12:10.780 --> 12:12.980\n If we find, if all the life we ever find\n\n12:12.980 --> 12:14.740\n is the same origin of life event in the universe,\n\n12:14.740 --> 12:16.580\n it doesn't help me solve my problem.\n\n12:16.580 --> 12:19.380\n But it's possible that that would be a sign\n\n12:19.380 --> 12:22.260\n that you could separate the environment\n\n12:22.260 --> 12:24.780\n from the basic ingredients.\n\n12:24.780 --> 12:25.620\n Yes, that's true.\n\n12:25.620 --> 12:27.860\n So you can have like a life gun\n\n12:27.860 --> 12:30.100\n that you shoot throughout the universe.\n\n12:30.100 --> 12:32.900\n And then like once you shoot it,\n\n12:32.900 --> 12:34.900\n it's like the Simpsons with a makeup gun.\n\n12:34.900 --> 12:36.280\n That was a great episode.\n\n12:36.280 --> 12:39.060\n When you shoot this life gun,\n\n12:39.060 --> 12:42.380\n it'll find the Earth's, it'll like get sticky.\n\n12:42.380 --> 12:44.180\n It'll stick to the Earth's.\n\n12:44.180 --> 12:46.860\n And that kind of reduces the barrier\n\n12:46.860 --> 12:49.580\n of like the time it takes,\n\n12:49.580 --> 12:52.220\n the luck it takes to actually,\n\n12:52.220 --> 12:54.660\n from nothing, from the basic chemistry,\n\n12:54.660 --> 12:56.300\n from the basic physics of the universe\n\n12:56.300 --> 12:58.540\n for the life to spring up.\n\n12:58.540 --> 13:00.780\n Yeah, I think this is actually super important\n\n13:00.780 --> 13:01.700\n to just think about,\n\n13:01.700 --> 13:05.540\n like does life getting seated on a planet\n\n13:05.540 --> 13:08.820\n have to be geochemically compatible with that planet?\n\n13:08.820 --> 13:11.340\n So you're suggesting like we could just shoot guns in space\n\n13:11.340 --> 13:13.140\n and like life could go to Mars\n\n13:13.140 --> 13:16.500\n and then it would just live there and be happy there.\n\n13:16.500 --> 13:18.400\n But that's actually an open question.\n\n13:18.400 --> 13:20.040\n So one of the things I was gonna say in response\n\n13:20.040 --> 13:22.620\n to your question about whether the origin of life\n\n13:22.620 --> 13:24.420\n happened once or multiple times,\n\n13:24.420 --> 13:26.400\n is for me personally right now in my thinking,\n\n13:26.400 --> 13:28.400\n although this changes on a weekly basis,\n\n13:28.400 --> 13:31.740\n but is that I think of life more as a planetary phenomenon.\n\n13:31.740 --> 13:32.740\n So I think the origin of life\n\n13:32.740 --> 13:37.380\n because life is so intimately tied to planetary cycles\n\n13:37.380 --> 13:38.780\n and planetary processes,\n\n13:38.780 --> 13:39.980\n and this goes all the way back\n\n13:39.980 --> 13:41.540\n through the history of our planet,\n\n13:41.540 --> 13:44.220\n that the origin of life itself grew out of geochemistry\n\n13:44.220 --> 13:46.300\n and became coupled and controlled geochemistry.\n\n13:46.300 --> 13:49.160\n And when we start to talk about life existing on the planet\n\n13:49.160 --> 13:51.220\n is when we have evidence of life\n\n13:51.220 --> 13:54.120\n actually influencing properties of the planet.\n\n13:55.060 --> 13:59.220\n And so if life is a planetary property,\n\n13:59.220 --> 14:01.660\n then going to Mars is not a trivial thing\n\n14:01.660 --> 14:05.520\n because you basically have to make Mars more Earth like.\n\n14:05.520 --> 14:07.620\n And so in some sense,\n\n14:07.620 --> 14:09.460\n like when I think about sort of longterm vision\n\n14:09.460 --> 14:11.700\n of humans in space, for example,\n\n14:11.700 --> 14:14.020\n really what you're talking about when you're saying,\n\n14:14.020 --> 14:16.620\n let's send our civilization to Mars\n\n14:16.620 --> 14:18.660\n is you're not saying let's send our civilization to Mars,\n\n14:18.660 --> 14:21.900\n you're saying let's reproduce our planet on Mars.\n\n14:21.900 --> 14:23.220\n Like the information from our planet\n\n14:23.220 --> 14:26.180\n actually has to go to Mars and make Mars more Earth like,\n\n14:26.180 --> 14:28.560\n which means that you're now having a reproduction process,\n\n14:28.560 --> 14:29.940\n like a cell reproduces itself\n\n14:29.940 --> 14:32.540\n to propagate information in the future.\n\n14:32.540 --> 14:35.280\n Planets have to figure out how to reproduce their conditions,\n\n14:35.280 --> 14:37.980\n including geochemical conditions on other planets\n\n14:37.980 --> 14:40.360\n in order to actually reproduce life in the universe,\n\n14:40.360 --> 14:41.700\n which is kind of a little bit radical,\n\n14:41.700 --> 14:44.380\n but I think for longterm sustainability\n\n14:44.380 --> 14:47.300\n of life on a planet, that's absolutely essential.\n\n14:47.300 --> 14:50.680\n Okay, so if we were to think about life\n\n14:50.680 --> 14:52.780\n as a planetary phenomena,\n\n14:52.780 --> 14:55.100\n and so life on Mars would be best\n\n14:55.100 --> 14:57.580\n if it's way different than life on Earth,\n\n14:57.580 --> 14:59.620\n we have to ask the very basic question\n\n14:59.620 --> 15:03.380\n of what is life?\n\n15:03.380 --> 15:06.180\n I actually don't think that's the right question to ask.\n\n15:06.180 --> 15:07.740\n It took me a long time to get there, right?\n\n15:07.740 --> 15:08.820\n So I... Cross it out.\n\n15:08.820 --> 15:11.660\n Yeah, cross it off your list, it's wrong.\n\n15:11.660 --> 15:13.020\n Next question.\n\n15:13.020 --> 15:15.220\n No, no, no, I mean, I think it has an answer,\n\n15:15.220 --> 15:17.820\n but I think the part of the problem is,\n\n15:17.820 --> 15:19.260\n you know, most of the places in science\n\n15:19.260 --> 15:20.100\n where we get really stuck\n\n15:20.100 --> 15:22.260\n is because we don't know what questions to ask.\n\n15:22.260 --> 15:24.020\n And so you can't answer a question\n\n15:24.020 --> 15:25.860\n if you're asking the wrong question.\n\n15:25.860 --> 15:29.380\n And I think the way I think about it\n\n15:29.380 --> 15:31.180\n is obviously I'm interested in what life is.\n\n15:31.180 --> 15:32.460\n So I'm being a little cheeky when I say\n\n15:32.460 --> 15:33.580\n that's the wrong question to ask.\n\n15:33.580 --> 15:35.420\n That's exactly like the question\n\n15:35.420 --> 15:36.980\n that's like the core of my existence.\n\n15:36.980 --> 15:40.780\n But I think the way of framing that\n\n15:40.780 --> 15:43.140\n is what is it about our universe\n\n15:43.140 --> 15:47.440\n that allows features that we associate life to be there?\n\n15:47.440 --> 15:50.300\n And so really what I guess when I'm asking that question,\n\n15:50.300 --> 15:52.620\n what I'm after is an explanatory framework\n\n15:52.620 --> 15:54.340\n for what life is, right?\n\n15:54.340 --> 15:57.380\n And so most people, they try to go in and define life\n\n15:57.380 --> 15:59.660\n and they say, well, life is say,\n\n15:59.660 --> 16:01.680\n a self reproducing chemical system\n\n16:01.680 --> 16:02.980\n capable of Darwinian evolution.\n\n16:02.980 --> 16:05.440\n That's a very popular definition for life.\n\n16:05.440 --> 16:08.340\n Or life is something that metabolizes and eats.\n\n16:08.340 --> 16:10.060\n That is not how I think about life.\n\n16:10.060 --> 16:13.260\n What I think about life is there are principles\n\n16:13.260 --> 16:15.640\n and laws that govern our universe\n\n16:15.640 --> 16:17.980\n that we don't understand yet,\n\n16:17.980 --> 16:22.340\n that have something to do with how information interacts\n\n16:22.340 --> 16:23.660\n with the physical world.\n\n16:23.660 --> 16:26.300\n I don't know exactly what I mean even when I say that,\n\n16:26.300 --> 16:28.460\n because we don't know these rules,\n\n16:28.460 --> 16:32.180\n but it's a little bit like, I like to use analogies.\n\n16:32.180 --> 16:34.480\n You give me time to be like a little long winded\n\n16:34.480 --> 16:36.700\n for a second, even in as I,\n\n16:36.700 --> 16:39.520\n but sort of like if you look at the history of physics,\n\n16:39.520 --> 16:40.740\n for example, this is like,\n\n16:40.740 --> 16:45.220\n so we are in the period of the development of thought\n\n16:45.220 --> 16:47.980\n on our planet where we don't understand what we are yet.\n\n16:47.980 --> 16:49.100\n Right?\n\n16:49.100 --> 16:51.660\n There was a period of thought in the history of our planet\n\n16:51.660 --> 16:53.820\n where we didn't understand what gravity was.\n\n16:53.820 --> 16:55.740\n And we didn't understand, for example,\n\n16:55.740 --> 16:59.340\n that planets in the heavens were actually planets\n\n16:59.340 --> 17:02.060\n or that they operated by the same laws that we did.\n\n17:02.060 --> 17:05.140\n And so there has been this sort of progression\n\n17:05.140 --> 17:07.460\n of getting a deeper understanding\n\n17:07.460 --> 17:09.060\n of explaining basic phenomena.\n\n17:09.060 --> 17:10.420\n Like, I'm not gonna drop the cup.\n\n17:10.420 --> 17:11.260\n I'll drop the water bottle.\n\n17:11.260 --> 17:12.100\n There you go.\n\n17:12.100 --> 17:13.140\n Okay, that fell, right?\n\n17:13.140 --> 17:14.260\n But why did that fall?\n\n17:16.300 --> 17:19.180\n This is why I'm a theorist, not an experimentalist.\n\n17:19.180 --> 17:20.900\n That could have gone wrong in so many ways.\n\n17:20.900 --> 17:21.740\n I know, it could have,\n\n17:21.740 --> 17:23.700\n especially if I did the cup and it smashed.\n\n17:23.700 --> 17:28.700\n So if you take this view\n\n17:28.700 --> 17:30.460\n that there's sort of some missing principles,\n\n17:30.460 --> 17:33.700\n I associate them to information.\n\n17:33.700 --> 17:36.400\n And what the sort of feeling there is,\n\n17:36.400 --> 17:39.060\n there's some missing explanatory framework\n\n17:39.060 --> 17:40.440\n for how our universe works.\n\n17:40.440 --> 17:42.400\n And if we understood that physics,\n\n17:42.400 --> 17:44.580\n it would explain what we are.\n\n17:44.580 --> 17:46.240\n It might also explain a lot of other features\n\n17:46.240 --> 17:48.620\n we don't associate to life.\n\n17:48.620 --> 17:51.780\n And so it's a little like people accept the fact\n\n17:51.780 --> 17:54.340\n that gravity is a universal phenomena.\n\n17:54.340 --> 17:55.560\n But when we wanna study gravity,\n\n17:55.560 --> 17:57.460\n we study things like large scale,\n\n17:58.420 --> 18:02.740\n galactic structures or black holes or planets.\n\n18:02.740 --> 18:04.380\n If we wanna understand information\n\n18:04.380 --> 18:05.860\n and how it operates in the physical world,\n\n18:05.860 --> 18:08.380\n we study intelligent systems or living systems\n\n18:08.380 --> 18:10.980\n because they are the manifestation of that physics.\n\n18:10.980 --> 18:13.900\n And the fact that we can't see that clearly yet,\n\n18:13.900 --> 18:15.700\n or we don't have that explanatory framework,\n\n18:15.700 --> 18:17.420\n I think it's just because we haven't been thinking\n\n18:17.420 --> 18:18.700\n about the problem deeply enough.\n\n18:18.700 --> 18:21.500\n But I feel like if you're explaining something,\n\n18:21.500 --> 18:24.140\n you're deriving it from some more fundamental property.\n\n18:24.140 --> 18:28.780\n And of course, I have to say I'm wearing my physicist hat.\n\n18:28.780 --> 18:31.740\n So I have a huge bias of liking simple,\n\n18:31.740 --> 18:33.860\n elegant explanations of the universe\n\n18:33.860 --> 18:37.340\n that really are compelling.\n\n18:37.340 --> 18:39.940\n But I think one of the things that I've sort of\n\n18:39.940 --> 18:42.540\n maybe in some ways rejected my training as a physicist\n\n18:42.540 --> 18:44.580\n is that most of the elegant explanations\n\n18:44.580 --> 18:47.220\n that we have so far don't include us in the universe.\n\n18:47.220 --> 18:48.660\n And I can't help but think\n\n18:48.660 --> 18:50.340\n there's something really special about what we are.\n\n18:50.340 --> 18:52.940\n And there have to be some deep principles at play there.\n\n18:54.620 --> 18:57.420\n And so that's sort of my perspective on it.\n\n18:57.420 --> 18:59.460\n Now, when you ask me what life is,\n\n18:59.460 --> 19:02.060\n I have some ideas of what I think it is,\n\n19:02.060 --> 19:04.820\n but I think that we haven't gotten there yet\n\n19:04.820 --> 19:07.420\n because we haven't been able to see that structure.\n\n19:07.420 --> 19:09.340\n And just to go back to the gravity example,\n\n19:09.340 --> 19:12.380\n it's a little like in ancient times, they didn't know,\n\n19:12.380 --> 19:14.540\n I was talking about stars and heavens and things.\n\n19:14.540 --> 19:17.580\n They didn't know those were governed by the same principles\n\n19:17.580 --> 19:19.300\n as that darned experiment.\n\n19:19.300 --> 19:20.900\n Here's where I was going with it.\n\n19:20.900 --> 19:22.860\n Once you realize, like Newton did,\n\n19:22.860 --> 19:25.780\n that heavenly motions and earthly motions\n\n19:25.780 --> 19:27.060\n are governed by the same principles\n\n19:27.060 --> 19:29.060\n and you unify terrestrial and celestial motion,\n\n19:29.060 --> 19:31.220\n you get these more powerful ideas.\n\n19:31.220 --> 19:35.180\n And I think where life is is somehow unifying\n\n19:35.180 --> 19:38.500\n these abstract ideas of computation and information\n\n19:38.500 --> 19:40.700\n with the physical world, with matter,\n\n19:40.700 --> 19:43.700\n and realizing that there's some explanatory framework\n\n19:43.700 --> 19:46.900\n that's not physics and it's not computation,\n\n19:46.900 --> 19:49.580\n but it's something that's deeper.\n\n19:49.580 --> 19:52.100\n So answering the question of what is life\n\n19:52.100 --> 19:55.900\n requires deeply understanding something about the universe\n\n19:55.900 --> 19:58.900\n as information processing, the universe is computation.\n\n19:58.900 --> 19:59.740\n Sort of.\n\n19:59.740 --> 20:01.900\n It's something about, like would,\n\n20:01.900 --> 20:04.860\n once you come up with an answer to what is life,\n\n20:04.860 --> 20:07.180\n will the words information and computation\n\n20:07.180 --> 20:08.660\n be in the paragraph that answer?\n\n20:08.660 --> 20:09.500\n No, I don't think so.\n\n20:09.500 --> 20:10.460\n Oh, damn it, okay.\n\n20:10.460 --> 20:11.800\n I know, it doesn't help, does it?\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:14.000\n I know, I hate, actually I hate this about what I do\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:16.380\n because it's so hard to communicate, right, with words.\n\n20:16.380 --> 20:20.500\n Like when you have words that are ideas\n\n20:20.500 --> 20:22.700\n that have historically described one thing\n\n20:22.700 --> 20:24.200\n and you're trying to describe something\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:27.900\n people haven't seen yet, and the words just don't fit.\n\n20:27.900 --> 20:31.560\n So what's wrong, is it too ambiguous, the word information?\n\n20:31.560 --> 20:33.380\n We could switch to binary if you want.\n\n20:33.380 --> 20:35.220\n Yeah, no, I don't think it's binary either.\n\n20:35.220 --> 20:36.980\n I think information's just loaded.\n\n20:36.980 --> 20:39.260\n I use it, so the other way I might talk about it\n\n20:39.260 --> 20:41.980\n is the physics of causation, but I think that's worse\n\n20:41.980 --> 20:43.940\n because causation is even more loaded word\n\n20:43.940 --> 20:46.740\n than information.\n\n20:46.740 --> 20:48.780\n So causation is fundamental, you think?\n\n20:48.780 --> 20:52.220\n I do, yeah, and in some sense, I think the physics,\n\n20:52.220 --> 20:53.780\n so this is the really radical part,\n\n20:53.780 --> 20:55.500\n some sense, like when I really think about it\n\n20:55.500 --> 20:58.460\n sort of most deeply, what I think life is\n\n20:58.460 --> 21:00.140\n is actually the physics of existence,\n\n21:00.140 --> 21:01.900\n what gets to exist and why.\n\n21:02.780 --> 21:04.760\n And for simple elementary particles,\n\n21:04.760 --> 21:05.780\n that's not very complicated\n\n21:05.780 --> 21:06.940\n because the interactions are simple,\n\n21:06.940 --> 21:11.060\n but for things like you and me and human civilizations,\n\n21:11.060 --> 21:13.500\n what comes next in the universe\n\n21:13.500 --> 21:15.660\n is really dependent on what came before,\n\n21:15.660 --> 21:17.340\n and there's a huge space of possibilities\n\n21:17.340 --> 21:18.500\n of things that can exist.\n\n21:18.500 --> 21:20.540\n And when I say information and causation,\n\n21:20.540 --> 21:24.900\n what I mean is why is it that cups evolved in the universe\n\n21:24.900 --> 21:27.540\n and not some other object that could deliver water\n\n21:27.540 --> 21:28.600\n and not spill it?\n\n21:29.740 --> 21:31.580\n I don't know what you would call it.\n\n21:31.580 --> 21:34.020\n Maybe it wouldn't be a cup, but it's a huge,\n\n21:37.060 --> 21:38.980\n people talk about the space of things that could exist\n\n21:38.980 --> 21:40.860\n as being actually infinitely large, right?\n\n21:40.860 --> 21:43.420\n I don't know if I believe in infinity,\n\n21:43.420 --> 21:47.380\n but I do think that there is something very interesting\n\n21:47.380 --> 21:51.980\n about the problem of what exists\n\n21:51.980 --> 21:53.300\n in its relationship to life.\n\n21:53.300 --> 21:55.700\n So do you think the set of things\n\n21:55.700 --> 21:58.020\n that could exist is finite?\n\n21:58.020 --> 22:00.700\n It's very large, but if we were to think\n\n22:00.700 --> 22:02.680\n about the physics of existence,\n\n22:04.260 --> 22:07.020\n how many shapes of mugs can there be?\n\n22:08.420 --> 22:10.060\n In the initial programming.\n\n22:10.060 --> 22:13.020\n I should go to the math department for that.\n\n22:13.020 --> 22:14.700\n So that's not a topology question.\n\n22:14.700 --> 22:17.780\n I just mean, maybe another way to ask is\n\n22:17.780 --> 22:20.340\n what do you think is fundamental to the universe\n\n22:20.340 --> 22:21.660\n and what is emergent?\n\n22:21.660 --> 22:24.800\n So if existence, are we supposed to think of that\n\n22:24.800 --> 22:26.900\n as somehow fundamental, you think?\n\n22:26.900 --> 22:28.660\n So there's a couple of problems in physics\n\n22:28.660 --> 22:29.820\n that I think this is related to.\n\n22:29.820 --> 22:31.380\n One is why does mathematics work\n\n22:31.380 --> 22:33.300\n at describing reality so well?\n\n22:33.300 --> 22:36.500\n And then there is this problem of we don't understand\n\n22:36.500 --> 22:38.800\n why the laws of physics are the way they are,\n\n22:38.800 --> 22:40.660\n or why certain things get to exist,\n\n22:40.660 --> 22:44.060\n or what put in place the initial condition of our universe.\n\n22:44.060 --> 22:47.440\n There's all of these sort of really deep and big problems,\n\n22:47.440 --> 22:51.900\n and they all indirectly are related, I think,\n\n22:51.900 --> 22:54.060\n to the same kind of thing that,\n\n22:55.420 --> 22:56.860\n our physics is really good\n\n22:56.860 --> 22:58.620\n if you specify the initial condition\n\n22:58.620 --> 23:01.000\n at specifying a certain sequence of events,\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.180\n but it doesn't deal with the fact\n\n23:03.180 --> 23:04.980\n that other things could have happened,\n\n23:04.980 --> 23:06.640\n which is kind of an informational property,\n\n23:06.640 --> 23:08.820\n like a counterfactual property.\n\n23:08.820 --> 23:12.220\n And it's not good at explaining\n\n23:13.780 --> 23:15.860\n this conversation right now.\n\n23:15.860 --> 23:17.660\n There are certain things that are outside\n\n23:17.660 --> 23:19.620\n the explanatory reach of current physics,\n\n23:19.620 --> 23:22.900\n and I think they require looking at it\n\n23:22.900 --> 23:25.060\n from a completely different direction.\n\n23:25.060 --> 23:26.980\n And so I don't wanna have to fine tune\n\n23:26.980 --> 23:28.860\n the initial condition of the universe\n\n23:28.860 --> 23:30.740\n to specify precisely all the information\n\n23:30.740 --> 23:31.580\n in this conversation.\n\n23:31.580 --> 23:33.620\n I think that's a ridiculous assertion.\n\n23:33.620 --> 23:35.620\n But that's sort of like how people wanna frame it\n\n23:35.620 --> 23:40.580\n when they talk about the standard model is sufficient\n\n23:40.580 --> 23:42.060\n if we had computing power\n\n23:42.060 --> 23:44.660\n to basically explain all of life in our existence.\n\n23:44.660 --> 23:45.780\n An interesting thing you said\n\n23:45.780 --> 23:48.640\n is the way we think about information computation\n\n23:48.640 --> 23:53.380\n is by observing a particular kind of systems on Earth\n\n23:53.380 --> 23:56.860\n that exhibit something we think of as intelligence.\n\n23:56.860 --> 24:01.060\n But that's like looking at, I guess, the tip of an iceberg,\n\n24:01.060 --> 24:03.060\n and we should be really looking at the fundamentals\n\n24:03.060 --> 24:08.060\n of the iceberg, like what makes water and ice\n\n24:08.900 --> 24:13.100\n and the chemistry from which intelligence emerges,\n\n24:13.100 --> 24:14.680\n essentially. Yes, yes.\n\n24:14.680 --> 24:17.140\n We can't just couple the information from the physics,\n\n24:17.140 --> 24:19.300\n and I think that's what we've gotten really good at doing,\n\n24:19.300 --> 24:23.540\n especially with sort of the modern age\n\n24:23.540 --> 24:28.540\n where software is so abstracted from hardware.\n\n24:29.580 --> 24:31.780\n But the entire process of biological evolution\n\n24:31.780 --> 24:33.300\n has basically been built,\n\n24:33.300 --> 24:36.700\n like been building layers of increasing abstraction.\n\n24:36.700 --> 24:39.300\n And so it's really hard to see that physics in us,\n\n24:39.300 --> 24:42.540\n but it's much clearer to see it in molecules.\n\n24:42.540 --> 24:44.820\n Yeah, but I guess I'm trying to figure out\n\n24:44.820 --> 24:47.700\n what do you think are the best tools to look at it?\n\n24:48.580 --> 24:50.340\n What do you think?\n\n24:50.340 --> 24:51.660\n An open mind?\n\n24:51.660 --> 24:52.500\n Is that a tool?\n\n24:53.460 --> 24:55.300\n What's the physics of an open mind?\n\n24:56.620 --> 24:58.580\n I think if we solve that, we'll solve everything.\n\n24:58.580 --> 24:59.660\n I'm saying an open mind\n\n24:59.660 --> 25:02.500\n because I think the biggest stumbling block\n\n25:03.700 --> 25:05.940\n to understanding sort of the things\n\n25:05.940 --> 25:07.660\n I've been trying to articulate,\n\n25:07.660 --> 25:09.020\n and when I talk also with colleagues\n\n25:09.020 --> 25:11.660\n that are thinking deeply about these same issues,\n\n25:11.660 --> 25:15.440\n is none of it is inconsistent with what we know.\n\n25:15.440 --> 25:18.260\n It's just such a radically different perception\n\n25:18.260 --> 25:19.700\n of the way we understand things now\n\n25:19.700 --> 25:21.340\n that it's hard for people to get there.\n\n25:21.340 --> 25:23.140\n And in some ways you have to almost forget\n\n25:23.140 --> 25:25.900\n what you've learned in order to learn something new, right?\n\n25:25.900 --> 25:27.900\n So I feel like most of my career\n\n25:27.900 --> 25:29.920\n trying to understand the problem of life\n\n25:29.920 --> 25:32.460\n has been variously forgetting\n\n25:32.460 --> 25:35.620\n and then relearning things that I learned in physics.\n\n25:35.620 --> 25:40.620\n And I think you have to have a capacity to learn things,\n\n25:41.800 --> 25:44.460\n but then accept that things that you learned\n\n25:44.460 --> 25:49.460\n might not be true or might need refinement or reframing.\n\n25:51.900 --> 25:53.300\n And the best way I can say that\n\n25:53.300 --> 25:54.660\n is just like with a physics education,\n\n25:54.660 --> 25:56.900\n there are just certain things you're told in undergrad\n\n25:56.900 --> 25:58.980\n that are like facts about the world.\n\n25:58.980 --> 26:01.300\n And your physics professors never tell you\n\n26:01.300 --> 26:04.300\n that those facts actually emerge from a human mind, right?\n\n26:04.300 --> 26:05.500\n So we're taught to think about,\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:07.420\n say the laws of physics, for example,\n\n26:07.420 --> 26:09.460\n as this like autonomous thing\n\n26:09.460 --> 26:10.800\n that exists outside of our universe\n\n26:10.800 --> 26:12.500\n and tells our universe how it works.\n\n26:13.500 --> 26:15.500\n But the laws of physics were invented by human minds\n\n26:15.500 --> 26:17.460\n to describe things that are regularities\n\n26:17.460 --> 26:19.420\n in our everyday experience.\n\n26:19.420 --> 26:21.620\n They don't exist autonomous to the universe.\n\n26:21.620 --> 26:23.940\n Right, so it's like turtles on top of turtles,\n\n26:23.940 --> 26:26.420\n but eventually it gets to the human mind,\n\n26:26.420 --> 26:29.740\n and then you have to explain the human mind with the turtles.\n\n26:29.740 --> 26:32.620\n So you have to, it comes from humans,\n\n26:32.620 --> 26:34.740\n this understanding, this simplification of the universe,\n\n26:34.740 --> 26:36.340\n these models.\n\n26:36.340 --> 26:38.260\n There's a guy named Stephen Wolfram.\n\n26:38.260 --> 26:42.020\n There's a concept called cellular automata.\n\n26:42.020 --> 26:47.020\n So there's some mysteries in these systems\n\n26:47.580 --> 26:49.420\n that are computational in nature\n\n26:49.420 --> 26:54.020\n that have maybe echoes of the kind of mysteries\n\n26:54.020 --> 26:57.820\n we should need to solve to understand what is life.\n\n26:59.060 --> 27:04.060\n So if we could talk, take a computational view of things,\n\n27:04.620 --> 27:06.220\n do you think there's something compelling\n\n27:06.220 --> 27:09.860\n to reducing everything down to computation,\n\n27:09.860 --> 27:12.060\n like the universe is computation,\n\n27:12.060 --> 27:15.260\n and then trying to understand life?\n\n27:15.260 --> 27:18.900\n So throw away the biology, throw away the chemistry,\n\n27:18.900 --> 27:20.100\n throw away even the physics\n\n27:20.100 --> 27:22.780\n that you learn undergrad and graduate school,\n\n27:22.780 --> 27:25.940\n and more look at these simple little systems,\n\n27:25.940 --> 27:28.340\n whether it's cellular automata or whatever the heck\n\n27:28.340 --> 27:29.660\n kind of computational systems\n\n27:29.660 --> 27:31.540\n that operate on simple local rules\n\n27:31.540 --> 27:35.260\n and then create complexity as they evolve.\n\n27:36.220 --> 27:39.460\n Is it at all, do you think, productive\n\n27:39.460 --> 27:42.100\n to focus on those kinds of systems\n\n27:42.100 --> 27:44.220\n to get an inkling of what is life?\n\n27:44.220 --> 27:48.740\n And if it is, do you think it's possible\n\n27:48.740 --> 27:51.620\n to come up with some kind of laws and principles\n\n27:51.620 --> 27:56.140\n about what makes life in those computational systems?\n\n27:56.140 --> 27:57.460\n So I like cellular automata.\n\n27:57.460 --> 27:59.580\n I think they're good toy models,\n\n27:59.580 --> 28:02.620\n but mostly where I've thought about them and used them\n\n28:02.620 --> 28:07.420\n is to actually, let's say,\n\n28:07.420 --> 28:10.380\n poke at sort of the current conceptual framework\n\n28:10.380 --> 28:13.180\n that we have and see where the flaws are.\n\n28:13.180 --> 28:15.660\n So I think the part that you're talking about\n\n28:15.660 --> 28:17.260\n that people find intriguing is that\n\n28:17.260 --> 28:19.660\n if you have a fairly simple rule\n\n28:19.660 --> 28:21.580\n and you specify some initial condition\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:23.460\n and you run that rule on that initial condition,\n\n28:23.460 --> 28:26.460\n you could get really complex patterns emerging.\n\n28:26.460 --> 28:28.980\n And ooh, doesn't that look lifelike?\n\n28:28.980 --> 28:29.820\n Yeah.\n\n28:29.820 --> 28:31.140\n Yeah.\n\n28:31.140 --> 28:32.220\n Well, it's like really surprising,\n\n28:32.220 --> 28:33.060\n isn't it really surprising?\n\n28:33.060 --> 28:35.180\n It is really surprising, and they're beautiful.\n\n28:35.180 --> 28:37.740\n And I think they have a lot of nice features\n\n28:37.740 --> 28:39.660\n associated to them.\n\n28:39.660 --> 28:42.260\n I think the things that I find,\n\n28:42.260 --> 28:46.420\n yeah, so I do think as a proof of principle\n\n28:46.420 --> 28:49.020\n that you can get complex things emerging from simple rules.\n\n28:49.020 --> 28:50.420\n They're great.\n\n28:50.420 --> 28:53.660\n As a sort of proof of principle about some of the ways\n\n28:53.660 --> 28:56.700\n that we might think of computation\n\n28:56.700 --> 28:59.380\n as being sort of a fundamental principle\n\n28:59.380 --> 29:00.700\n for dynamical systems\n\n29:00.700 --> 29:03.220\n and maybe the evolution of the universe as a whole,\n\n29:03.220 --> 29:05.620\n they're a great model system.\n\n29:05.620 --> 29:07.820\n As an explanatory framework for life,\n\n29:07.820 --> 29:10.860\n I think they're a bit problematic\n\n29:10.860 --> 29:14.060\n for the same reason that the laws of physics\n\n29:14.060 --> 29:16.260\n are a bit problematic.\n\n29:16.260 --> 29:19.260\n And the clearest way I can articulate that\n\n29:19.260 --> 29:22.380\n is like cellular automata are actually cast\n\n29:22.380 --> 29:24.820\n in sort of a conceptual framework\n\n29:24.820 --> 29:26.500\n for how the universe should be described\n\n29:26.500 --> 29:29.580\n that goes all the way back to Newton, in fact,\n\n29:29.580 --> 29:33.660\n with this idea that we can have a fixed law of motion,\n\n29:33.660 --> 29:36.060\n which exists sort of, it's given to you.\n\n29:37.420 --> 29:40.420\n The great programmer in the sky gave you this equation\n\n29:40.420 --> 29:43.340\n or this rule, and then you just run with it.\n\n29:43.340 --> 29:45.020\n And the rule doesn't have,\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:46.540\n so a good feature of the rule\n\n29:46.540 --> 29:49.140\n is it doesn't have specified in the rule\n\n29:49.140 --> 29:51.020\n information about the patterns it generates.\n\n29:51.020 --> 29:53.780\n So you wouldn't want, for example,\n\n29:53.780 --> 29:56.940\n my cup or my water bottle or me sitting here\n\n29:56.940 --> 29:58.580\n to be specified in the laws of physics.\n\n29:58.580 --> 29:59.420\n That would be ridiculous\n\n29:59.420 --> 30:01.140\n because it wouldn't be a very simple explanation\n\n30:01.140 --> 30:01.980\n of all the things happening.\n\n30:01.980 --> 30:03.540\n It'd have to explain everything.\n\n30:03.540 --> 30:06.100\n So, and cellular automata have that feature\n\n30:06.100 --> 30:08.380\n and the laws of physics have that feature.\n\n30:09.300 --> 30:13.060\n But you also need to specify the initial condition.\n\n30:13.060 --> 30:15.380\n And it also, it basically means\n\n30:15.380 --> 30:17.020\n that everything that happens\n\n30:17.020 --> 30:19.860\n is sort of a consequence of that initial condition.\n\n30:19.860 --> 30:21.740\n And I think this kind of framework\n\n30:21.740 --> 30:25.020\n is just not the right one for biology.\n\n30:25.020 --> 30:28.220\n And part of the way that it's easiest to see this\n\n30:28.220 --> 30:31.820\n is a lot of people talk about self reference\n\n30:31.820 --> 30:33.420\n being important in life.\n\n30:33.420 --> 30:35.300\n The fact that, you know,\n\n30:35.300 --> 30:39.220\n like the genome has information encoded in it,\n\n30:39.220 --> 30:41.660\n that information gets read out.\n\n30:41.660 --> 30:45.100\n It specifies something about the architecture of a cell.\n\n30:45.100 --> 30:47.020\n The architecture of the cell includes the genome.\n\n30:47.020 --> 30:49.780\n So the genome has basically self referential information.\n\n30:49.780 --> 30:52.980\n Self reference obviously comes up in computational law\n\n30:52.980 --> 30:56.660\n because it's kind of foundational to Turing's work\n\n30:56.660 --> 30:58.900\n and what G\u00f6del did with the incompleteness theorems\n\n30:58.900 --> 30:59.740\n and things.\n\n30:59.740 --> 31:02.540\n So there's a lot of parallels there\n\n31:02.540 --> 31:05.380\n and people have talked about that at depth.\n\n31:05.380 --> 31:06.780\n But the other way of kind of thinking about it\n\n31:06.780 --> 31:10.060\n in terms of like a more physicsy way of talking about it\n\n31:10.060 --> 31:12.220\n is that what it looks like in biology\n\n31:12.220 --> 31:15.860\n is that the rules or the laws depend on the state.\n\n31:15.860 --> 31:17.260\n This is typical in computer science.\n\n31:17.260 --> 31:18.460\n This is obvious to you.\n\n31:18.460 --> 31:19.780\n You know, the update rule depends\n\n31:19.780 --> 31:20.900\n on the state of the machine, right?\n\n31:20.900 --> 31:24.740\n But, you know, you don't think about, you know,\n\n31:24.740 --> 31:27.500\n that being sort of the dynamic in physics.\n\n31:27.500 --> 31:28.900\n It's, you know, the rules given to you\n\n31:28.900 --> 31:32.660\n and then it's a very special subclass say of computations\n\n31:32.660 --> 31:36.540\n if, you know, you don't ever change the update.\n\n31:36.540 --> 31:38.300\n But in biology, it seems to be that the state\n\n31:38.300 --> 31:40.980\n and the law change together as a function of time\n\n31:40.980 --> 31:43.740\n and we don't have that as a paradigm in physics.\n\n31:43.740 --> 31:45.620\n And so a lot of people talk about this\n\n31:45.620 --> 31:47.540\n as being kind of a perplexing feature\n\n31:47.540 --> 31:49.740\n that maybe there are certain scenarios\n\n31:49.740 --> 31:51.140\n where the laws of physics\n\n31:51.140 --> 31:52.980\n or the laws that govern a particular system\n\n31:52.980 --> 31:56.580\n actually change as a function of the state of that system.\n\n31:56.580 --> 31:57.420\n That's trippy.\n\n31:57.420 --> 31:58.260\n Yeah.\n\n31:58.260 --> 32:01.660\n So yeah, the hope of physics, it's a hope, I guess,\n\n32:01.660 --> 32:05.340\n but often stated as a underlying assumption\n\n32:05.340 --> 32:08.740\n is that the law is static.\n\n32:08.740 --> 32:10.100\n Right.\n\n32:10.100 --> 32:10.940\n Okay.\n\n32:10.940 --> 32:12.580\n And even having laws that vary in time\n\n32:12.580 --> 32:16.220\n and not even as a function of the state is very radical.\n\n32:16.220 --> 32:17.060\n When you...\n\n32:17.060 --> 32:20.020\n The time in general, like you wanna remove time\n\n32:20.020 --> 32:22.020\n from the equation as much as possible.\n\n32:22.020 --> 32:24.220\n Yeah, I do.\n\n32:24.220 --> 32:25.580\n There's some interesting things in this\n\n32:25.580 --> 32:28.020\n like when we think sort of more deeply\n\n32:28.020 --> 32:29.980\n about the actual physics that we're trying to propose\n\n32:29.980 --> 32:32.660\n governs life with me with collaborators\n\n32:32.660 --> 32:35.160\n and then also other people that think about similar things\n\n32:35.160 --> 32:36.760\n that time might actually be fundamental\n\n32:36.760 --> 32:38.900\n and there really is an ordering to time.\n\n32:38.900 --> 32:41.020\n And that events in the universe are unique\n\n32:41.020 --> 32:43.980\n because they have a particular, they happen,\n\n32:43.980 --> 32:45.180\n like an object in the universe\n\n32:45.180 --> 32:48.300\n requires a certain history of events in order to exist,\n\n32:48.300 --> 32:49.300\n which therefore suggests\n\n32:49.300 --> 32:50.580\n that time really does have an ordering.\n\n32:50.580 --> 32:51.420\n I'm not talking about the flow of time\n\n32:51.420 --> 32:53.660\n and our perception of time, just the ordering of events.\n\n32:53.660 --> 32:54.500\n Causation of things.\n\n32:54.500 --> 32:56.660\n Yes, causation, there's that word again.\n\n32:56.660 --> 32:59.460\n So causation, that's when you say time, you mean causation.\n\n32:59.460 --> 33:00.780\n Yes.\n\n33:00.780 --> 33:05.780\n In your proposed model of the physics of life,\n\n33:05.820 --> 33:08.300\n the fundamental thing would be causation.\n\n33:08.300 --> 33:09.740\n If you were to bet your money\n\n33:09.740 --> 33:12.440\n on one particular horse or whatever.\n\n33:12.440 --> 33:13.280\n Yes.\n\n33:13.280 --> 33:15.480\n And then space is emergent.\n\n33:15.480 --> 33:16.320\n Yes.\n\n33:16.320 --> 33:18.260\n So everything's emergent except time.\n\n33:19.140 --> 33:21.060\n Kind of, yeah, or causation.\n\n33:21.060 --> 33:22.700\n And laws change all the time.\n\n33:22.700 --> 33:24.260\n Why does it look like laws are the same?\n\n33:24.260 --> 33:27.940\n Laws, well, because, well, one way,\n\n33:27.940 --> 33:29.980\n and I actually, this idea comes from Lee Cronin\n\n33:29.980 --> 33:31.860\n because I work with him very closely on these things,\n\n33:31.860 --> 33:33.780\n is that the laws of physics look the way they do\n\n33:33.780 --> 33:35.580\n because they're low memory laws.\n\n33:35.580 --> 33:37.860\n So they don't require a lot of information to specify them.\n\n33:37.860 --> 33:39.740\n They're very easy for the universe to implement.\n\n33:39.740 --> 33:42.100\n But if you get something like me, for example,\n\n33:42.100 --> 33:44.560\n I require 4 billion year history to exist in the universe.\n\n33:44.560 --> 33:47.100\n I come with a lot of historical baggage.\n\n33:47.100 --> 33:48.400\n And that's part of what I am\n\n33:48.400 --> 33:50.700\n as a set of causes that exist in the universe.\n\n33:52.680 --> 33:55.220\n So I have local rules that apply to me\n\n33:55.220 --> 33:57.020\n that are associated with sort of the information\n\n33:57.020 --> 33:59.220\n in my history that aren't universal\n\n33:59.220 --> 34:01.020\n to every object in the universe.\n\n34:01.020 --> 34:03.820\n And there are some things that are very easy\n\n34:03.820 --> 34:06.020\n to implement low memory rules\n\n34:06.020 --> 34:08.780\n that apply to everything in the universe.\n\n34:08.780 --> 34:10.540\n So there's no shortcuts to you.\n\n34:10.540 --> 34:13.580\n No, so yeah, I don't believe in things like Boltzmann brains\n\n34:13.580 --> 34:17.260\n or fluctuations out of the vacuum\n\n34:17.260 --> 34:19.700\n that can produce things like your desk ornaments.\n\n34:21.420 --> 34:23.380\n I actually think they require\n\n34:23.380 --> 34:25.620\n a particular causal chain of events to exist.\n\n34:26.460 --> 34:28.580\n Well, I appreciate the togetherness of that,\n\n34:28.580 --> 34:31.020\n but so how does that,\n\n34:31.020 --> 34:34.020\n if we have to simulate the entire universe\n\n34:34.020 --> 34:37.060\n to create the ornaments in the two of us,\n\n34:37.060 --> 34:42.060\n how are we supposed to create engineer life in the lab?\n\n34:42.860 --> 34:45.440\n This goes back to sort of the critique of the RNA world.\n\n34:45.440 --> 34:46.940\n I think one of the problems,\n\n34:46.940 --> 34:48.340\n and I'll get to answer your question,\n\n34:48.340 --> 34:50.300\n but I think this is kind of relevant here.\n\n34:50.300 --> 34:52.820\n One of the problems with the RNA world,\n\n34:52.820 --> 34:54.260\n when we test it in the laboratory,\n\n34:54.260 --> 34:57.300\n is how much information we're putting into the experiment.\n\n34:57.300 --> 35:00.060\n We specify the flasks, we make pure reagents,\n\n35:00.060 --> 35:01.860\n we mix them, we take them out,\n\n35:01.860 --> 35:03.420\n we put them in the next flask,\n\n35:03.420 --> 35:05.620\n we change the pH, we change the UV light,\n\n35:05.620 --> 35:07.100\n and then we get a molecule,\n\n35:07.100 --> 35:09.060\n and it's not even an RNA molecule necessarily,\n\n35:09.060 --> 35:11.140\n it might just be a base, right?\n\n35:11.140 --> 35:14.680\n And so people don't usually think about the fact\n\n35:14.680 --> 35:17.860\n that we're agents in the universe making that experiment,\n\n35:17.860 --> 35:19.460\n and therefore we put a little bit of life\n\n35:19.460 --> 35:20.520\n into that experiment,\n\n35:21.860 --> 35:23.740\n because it's part of our biological lineage,\n\n35:23.740 --> 35:26.820\n in the same sense that I am a part of the biological lineage.\n\n35:26.820 --> 35:27.660\n The experiment is.\n\n35:27.660 --> 35:31.140\n I mean, our ideas are injecting life.\n\n35:31.140 --> 35:31.980\n Yes.\n\n35:31.980 --> 35:34.140\n And the constraints that we put on the experiments,\n\n35:34.140 --> 35:36.740\n because those conditions wouldn't exist in the universe\n\n35:36.740 --> 35:38.580\n on planet Earth at that time\n\n35:38.580 --> 35:40.420\n without us as the boundary condition, right?\n\n35:40.420 --> 35:41.420\n So.\n\n35:41.420 --> 35:42.780\n Even though we're not actually adding\n\n35:42.780 --> 35:45.160\n any actual chemistry or biology\n\n35:45.160 --> 35:47.660\n that could be identified as life,\n\n35:47.660 --> 35:49.860\n are the constraints we're adding to the experiment,\n\n35:49.860 --> 35:51.300\n the design of the experiment.\n\n35:51.300 --> 35:53.080\n Yeah, you can think of the design experiment as a program.\n\n35:53.080 --> 35:54.340\n You put information in.\n\n35:54.340 --> 35:57.180\n It's an algorithmic procedure that you design the experiment.\n\n35:57.180 --> 35:59.940\n And so the origin of life problem\n\n35:59.940 --> 36:02.740\n becomes one of minimizing the information\n\n36:02.740 --> 36:04.900\n we put into physics\n\n36:04.900 --> 36:07.140\n to actually watch the spontaneous origin of life.\n\n36:07.140 --> 36:09.860\n Can we have, so can, is it possible in the lab\n\n36:09.860 --> 36:12.180\n to have an information vacuum then?\n\n36:12.180 --> 36:13.020\n So like.\n\n36:13.020 --> 36:14.980\n If we could, we would, that would be amazing.\n\n36:14.980 --> 36:15.820\n I don't know.\n\n36:15.820 --> 36:17.700\n That's a good question for, more for Lee.\n\n36:17.700 --> 36:18.700\n Yeah, you guys, by the way,\n\n36:18.700 --> 36:21.260\n for people who don't know, Lee Cronin is,\n\n36:21.260 --> 36:23.020\n you guys are colleagues.\n\n36:23.020 --> 36:23.860\n Yeah.\n\n36:23.860 --> 36:26.980\n I've gotten the chance to listen to the two of you talking.\n\n36:26.980 --> 36:28.300\n There's great sort of chemistry\n\n36:28.300 --> 36:30.580\n and you're brilliant brainstorming together.\n\n36:30.580 --> 36:34.420\n And there's a really exciting community here\n\n36:34.420 --> 36:36.900\n of brilliant people from different disciplines\n\n36:36.900 --> 36:39.820\n working on the problem of life, of complexity,\n\n36:39.820 --> 36:42.420\n of, I don't know, whatever.\n\n36:42.420 --> 36:45.220\n The words fail us to describe the exact problem\n\n36:45.220 --> 36:47.340\n we're trying to actually understand here.\n\n36:47.340 --> 36:49.300\n Intelligence, all those kinds of things.\n\n36:49.300 --> 36:54.300\n Okay, so what, from a lab perspective,\n\n36:54.660 --> 36:57.260\n so Lee, I guess, would you call him a chemist?\n\n36:57.260 --> 36:58.100\n No?\n\n36:58.100 --> 36:59.580\n I think by training he's a chemist,\n\n36:59.580 --> 37:01.140\n but I think most of the people that work in the field,\n\n37:01.140 --> 37:02.700\n we do have lost their discipline.\n\n37:02.700 --> 37:06.260\n That's why I couldn't answer your question earlier.\n\n37:06.260 --> 37:07.100\n Okay.\n\n37:07.100 --> 37:07.940\n I don't know what you call him.\n\n37:07.940 --> 37:08.780\n Yeah.\n\n37:08.780 --> 37:09.620\n I don't know what I call myself.\n\n37:09.620 --> 37:11.300\n I don't know what I call any of my friends.\n\n37:11.300 --> 37:15.140\n So why is it so hard to create,\n\n37:15.140 --> 37:16.380\n and it's an interesting question,\n\n37:16.380 --> 37:19.380\n to create biological life in the lab.\n\n37:19.380 --> 37:21.780\n Like from your perspective,\n\n37:21.780 --> 37:23.980\n is that an important problem to work on\n\n37:23.980 --> 37:28.980\n to try to recreate the historical origin of life on Earth\n\n37:29.180 --> 37:31.100\n or echoes of the historical origin?\n\n37:31.100 --> 37:32.740\n I think echoes is more appropriate.\n\n37:32.740 --> 37:34.900\n I don't think asking the question\n\n37:34.900 --> 37:37.660\n of what was the exact historical sequence of events\n\n37:37.660 --> 37:40.420\n and engineering every step in the process\n\n37:40.420 --> 37:44.060\n to make exactly the chemistry of life on Earth as we know it\n\n37:44.060 --> 37:46.340\n is a meaningful way of asking the question.\n\n37:46.340 --> 37:47.820\n And it's a little bit like,\n\n37:49.660 --> 37:50.980\n since you're in computer science,\n\n37:50.980 --> 37:53.420\n like if you know the answer to a problem,\n\n37:53.420 --> 37:56.020\n it's easier to find a program to specify the output, right?\n\n37:56.020 --> 37:58.340\n But if you don't know the answer a priori,\n\n37:58.340 --> 37:59.740\n finding an algorithm for it,\n\n37:59.740 --> 38:01.020\n like say finding a prime or something,\n\n38:01.020 --> 38:04.980\n it's easy to verify it's a prime number.\n\n38:04.980 --> 38:07.500\n It's hard to find the next prime.\n\n38:07.500 --> 38:10.940\n And the way the origin of life is structured right now\n\n38:10.940 --> 38:14.260\n in the historical problem is you know the answer\n\n38:14.260 --> 38:16.460\n and you're trying to retrodict it by breaking it down\n\n38:16.460 --> 38:17.580\n into the set of procedures\n\n38:17.580 --> 38:19.420\n where you're putting a lot of information in.\n\n38:19.420 --> 38:21.700\n And what we need to do is ask the question\n\n38:21.700 --> 38:26.140\n of how is it that the rules of how our universe is structured\n\n38:26.140 --> 38:28.060\n permit things like life to exist\n\n38:28.060 --> 38:29.740\n and what is the phenomena of life?\n\n38:29.740 --> 38:31.380\n And those questions are obviously\n\n38:31.380 --> 38:33.060\n essentially the same question.\n\n38:33.060 --> 38:37.820\n And so you're looking essentially for this missing physics,\n\n38:37.820 --> 38:39.700\n this missing explanation for what we are,\n\n38:39.700 --> 38:41.700\n and you need to set up proper experiments\n\n38:41.700 --> 38:43.500\n that are gonna allow you to probe\n\n38:43.500 --> 38:47.420\n the vast complexity of chemistry in an unconstrained way\n\n38:47.420 --> 38:50.180\n with as little information put in as possible\n\n38:50.180 --> 38:53.900\n to see when things, when does information actually emerge?\n\n38:53.900 --> 38:55.300\n How does it emerge?\n\n38:55.300 --> 38:56.140\n What is it?\n\n38:57.260 --> 39:00.260\n And part of the sort of conjecture we have\n\n39:00.260 --> 39:03.140\n is that this physics only becomes relevant\n\n39:03.140 --> 39:05.780\n or at least this is my personal conjecture\n\n39:05.780 --> 39:08.500\n and it's sort of validated\n\n39:08.500 --> 39:10.780\n by this kind of theory experiment collaboration\n\n39:10.780 --> 39:15.300\n that we have working in this area that this, you know,\n\n39:15.300 --> 39:17.420\n sort of, I made the point about like gravity\n\n39:17.420 --> 39:18.580\n existing everywhere, right?\n\n39:18.580 --> 39:21.260\n But when you study an atomic nucleus,\n\n39:21.260 --> 39:22.340\n you don't care about gravity.\n\n39:22.340 --> 39:23.980\n It's not relevant physics there, right?\n\n39:23.980 --> 39:26.020\n It's weak, it doesn't matter.\n\n39:26.020 --> 39:30.620\n And so this idea that there's kind of a physics\n\n39:30.620 --> 39:32.780\n associated with information,\n\n39:32.780 --> 39:36.260\n for me, it's very evident that that physics\n\n39:36.260 --> 39:38.940\n doesn't become relevant until you need information\n\n39:38.940 --> 39:41.620\n to specify the existence of a particular object.\n\n39:41.620 --> 39:44.140\n And the scale of reality where that happens\n\n39:44.140 --> 39:47.620\n is in chemistry because of the combinatorial diversity\n\n39:47.620 --> 39:50.980\n of chemical objects that can exist far out,\n\n39:50.980 --> 39:53.740\n exceeds the amount of resources in our universe.\n\n39:53.740 --> 39:56.620\n So if you want it, you can't make every possible protein\n\n39:56.620 --> 39:59.460\n of length, you know, 200 amino acids,\n\n39:59.460 --> 40:00.900\n there's not enough resources.\n\n40:00.900 --> 40:04.100\n So in order for this particular protein to exist\n\n40:04.100 --> 40:06.660\n and this protein to exist in high abundance\n\n40:06.660 --> 40:10.140\n means that you have to have a system that has knowledge\n\n40:10.140 --> 40:12.900\n of the existence of that protein and can build it.\n\n40:12.900 --> 40:15.580\n So existence comes to be at the chemical level.\n\n40:15.580 --> 40:19.660\n So existence is most, is best understood\n\n40:19.660 --> 40:20.700\n at the chemical level.\n\n40:20.700 --> 40:22.060\n It's most evident.\n\n40:22.060 --> 40:24.260\n It's a little bit like, nobody argues that gravity\n\n40:24.260 --> 40:25.820\n doesn't exist in an atomic nucleus.\n\n40:25.820 --> 40:27.820\n It's just not relevant physics there, right?\n\n40:27.820 --> 40:29.860\n So the physics of information.\n\n40:29.860 --> 40:30.700\n Is everywhere.\n\n40:30.700 --> 40:32.500\n It exists at every combinatorial scale,\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:34.180\n but it becomes more and more relevant\n\n40:34.180 --> 40:36.740\n the more set of possibilities that could exist\n\n40:36.740 --> 40:39.340\n because you have to specify more and more\n\n40:39.340 --> 40:41.780\n about why this thing exists and not the infinite.\n\n40:41.780 --> 40:43.340\n It's not an infinite set, but you know,\n\n40:43.340 --> 40:46.140\n the set of undefined set of other things that could exist.\n\n40:46.140 --> 40:50.540\n So can I ask a weird question, which is,\n\n40:50.540 --> 40:52.300\n so let's look into the future.\n\n40:53.580 --> 40:54.420\n I try that every day.\n\n40:54.420 --> 40:55.260\n It never works.\n\n40:56.180 --> 41:00.100\n So say a Nobel prize is given in physics,\n\n41:00.100 --> 41:05.100\n maybe chemistry for discovering the origin of life.\n\n41:06.540 --> 41:09.140\n No, but not the historical origin.\n\n41:09.140 --> 41:11.420\n Some kind of thing that we're talking about.\n\n41:12.620 --> 41:17.620\n What exactly would, what do you think that,\n\n41:19.900 --> 41:22.460\n like, what do you think that person,\n\n41:22.460 --> 41:24.700\n maybe you did to get that Nobel prize?\n\n41:24.700 --> 41:26.220\n Like what would they have to have done?\n\n41:26.220 --> 41:28.380\n Cause you can do a bunch of experiments that go\n\n41:28.380 --> 41:30.620\n like within the aha moment.\n\n41:30.620 --> 41:34.540\n Like you rarely get the Nobel prize for like,\n\n41:34.540 --> 41:37.060\n you've solved everything, we're done.\n\n41:37.060 --> 41:40.900\n It's like some inkling of some deep truth.\n\n41:40.900 --> 41:43.220\n Like what do you think that would actually look like?\n\n41:43.220 --> 41:45.140\n Would it be an experimental result?\n\n41:46.380 --> 41:48.820\n I mean, it will have to have some kind of experimental,\n\n41:48.820 --> 41:50.300\n maybe validation component.\n\n41:50.300 --> 41:52.260\n So what would that look like?\n\n41:52.260 --> 41:54.620\n This is an excellent question.\n\n41:54.620 --> 41:57.220\n I want to, sorry, I'm going to make a quick point,\n\n41:57.220 --> 41:58.700\n which is just a slight tangent.\n\n41:58.700 --> 42:01.220\n But you know, like when people ask about the origin of mass,\n\n42:01.220 --> 42:03.260\n and like looking for the Higgs mechanism and things,\n\n42:03.260 --> 42:04.220\n they never are like,\n\n42:04.220 --> 42:06.300\n we need to find the historical origins of life\n\n42:06.300 --> 42:07.140\n in the early unit.\n\n42:07.140 --> 42:08.380\n Although those things are related, right?\n\n42:08.380 --> 42:11.420\n So this problem of origins of life in the lab,\n\n42:11.420 --> 42:12.580\n I think is really important.\n\n42:12.580 --> 42:14.500\n But the Higgs is a good example\n\n42:14.500 --> 42:15.940\n because you had theory to guide it.\n\n42:15.940 --> 42:19.340\n So somehow you need to have an explanatory framework\n\n42:20.420 --> 42:24.700\n that can say that we should be looking for these features\n\n42:24.700 --> 42:27.300\n and explain why they might be there\n\n42:27.300 --> 42:28.980\n and then be able to do the experiment\n\n42:28.980 --> 42:30.980\n and demonstrate that it matches with the theory.\n\n42:30.980 --> 42:33.740\n But it has to be something that is outside\n\n42:33.740 --> 42:35.740\n sort of the paradigm of what we might expect\n\n42:35.740 --> 42:36.940\n based on what we know, right?\n\n42:36.940 --> 42:39.860\n So this is a really sort of tall order.\n\n42:39.860 --> 42:44.860\n And I think, I mean, I guess the way people would think\n\n42:45.540 --> 42:46.380\n about it is like, you know,\n\n42:46.380 --> 42:48.780\n if you had a bacteria that climbed out of your test tube\n\n42:48.780 --> 42:49.980\n or something, and it was like, you know,\n\n42:49.980 --> 42:51.100\n moving around on the surface,\n\n42:51.100 --> 42:52.460\n that would be ultimate validation.\n\n42:52.460 --> 42:54.580\n You saw the origin of life in an experiment,\n\n42:54.580 --> 42:56.900\n but I don't think that's quite what we're looking for.\n\n42:56.900 --> 43:01.420\n I think what we're looking for is evidence\n\n43:01.420 --> 43:05.500\n of when information that originated\n\n43:05.500 --> 43:07.900\n within the bounds of your experiment\n\n43:07.900 --> 43:11.460\n and you can demonstrably prove emerged spontaneously\n\n43:11.460 --> 43:14.100\n in your experiment, wasn't put in by you,\n\n43:14.100 --> 43:17.260\n actually started to govern the future dynamics\n\n43:17.260 --> 43:19.620\n of that system and specify it.\n\n43:19.620 --> 43:23.540\n And you could somehow relate those two features directly.\n\n43:23.540 --> 43:26.260\n So you know that the program specifying\n\n43:26.260 --> 43:27.540\n what's happening in that system\n\n43:27.540 --> 43:29.700\n is actually internal to that system.\n\n43:29.700 --> 43:32.100\n Like say you have a chemical thing in a box.\n\n43:32.100 --> 43:36.340\n Well, so that's one Nobel Prize winning experiment,\n\n43:36.340 --> 43:39.920\n which is like information in some fundamental way\n\n43:39.920 --> 43:42.860\n originated within the constraints of the system\n\n43:42.860 --> 43:44.600\n without you injecting anything.\n\n43:44.600 --> 43:49.180\n But another experiment is you injected something.\n\n43:49.180 --> 43:50.100\n Yeah.\n\n43:50.100 --> 43:52.100\n And got out information.\n\n43:52.100 --> 43:52.940\n Yes.\n\n43:52.940 --> 43:55.740\n So like you injected, I don't know,\n\n43:55.740 --> 44:00.740\n like some sugar and like something that doesn't necessarily\n\n44:01.260 --> 44:03.420\n feel like it should be information.\n\n44:03.420 --> 44:05.940\n Yeah, so I actually know, I mean,\n\n44:05.940 --> 44:07.140\n sugar is information, right?\n\n44:07.140 --> 44:10.120\n So part of the argument here is that every physical object\n\n44:10.120 --> 44:12.880\n is, well, it's information,\n\n44:12.880 --> 44:14.580\n but it's a set of causal histories\n\n44:14.580 --> 44:16.620\n and also a set of possible futures.\n\n44:16.620 --> 44:20.500\n So there is an experiment that I've talked a lot about\n\n44:20.500 --> 44:22.100\n with Lee Cronin, but also with Michael Lockman\n\n44:22.100 --> 44:23.900\n and Chris Kempis who are at Santa Fe\n\n44:23.900 --> 44:25.780\n about this idea that sometimes we talk about\n\n44:25.780 --> 44:27.900\n as like seeding assembly,\n\n44:27.900 --> 44:30.560\n which is you take a high complexity,\n\n44:30.560 --> 44:32.860\n like an object that exists in the universe\n\n44:32.860 --> 44:34.900\n because of a long causal history,\n\n44:34.900 --> 44:38.500\n and you seed it into a system of lower causal history.\n\n44:38.500 --> 44:40.860\n And then suddenly you see all of this complexity\n\n44:40.860 --> 44:41.980\n being generated.\n\n44:41.980 --> 44:44.980\n So I think another validation of the physics would be,\n\n44:44.980 --> 44:46.940\n say you engineer an organism\n\n44:46.940 --> 44:49.740\n by purposefully introducing something\n\n44:49.740 --> 44:51.220\n where you understand the relationship\n\n44:51.220 --> 44:54.080\n between the causal history of the organism\n\n44:54.080 --> 44:57.580\n and the say very complex chemical set of ingredients\n\n44:57.580 --> 44:58.820\n you're adding to it.\n\n44:58.820 --> 45:01.980\n And then you can predict the future evolution of that system\n\n45:01.980 --> 45:06.920\n to some statistical set of constraints and possibilities\n\n45:06.920 --> 45:10.100\n for what it will look like in the future.\n\n45:11.620 --> 45:12.900\n I'm a physical structure, obviously,\n\n45:12.900 --> 45:15.220\n like I'm composed of atoms,\n\n45:15.220 --> 45:16.660\n the configuration of them\n\n45:16.660 --> 45:19.380\n and the fact that they happen to be me\n\n45:19.380 --> 45:22.060\n is because I'm not actually my atoms,\n\n45:22.060 --> 45:24.680\n I am a informational pattern\n\n45:24.680 --> 45:28.940\n that keeps re patterning those atoms into Sarah.\n\n45:28.940 --> 45:32.060\n And I have also associated to me\n\n45:32.060 --> 45:36.220\n like a space of possible things that could exist\n\n45:36.220 --> 45:38.200\n that I can help mediate come into existence\n\n45:38.200 --> 45:41.240\n because of the information in my history.\n\n45:41.240 --> 45:45.720\n And so when you understand sort of that\n\n45:45.720 --> 45:49.140\n time is a real thing embedded in a physical object,\n\n45:50.080 --> 45:52.920\n then it becomes possible to talk about\n\n45:52.920 --> 45:56.960\n how histories when they interact\n\n45:56.960 --> 45:58.420\n and a history is not a unique thing,\n\n45:58.420 --> 45:59.900\n it's a set of possibilities.\n\n45:59.900 --> 46:00.740\n When they interact,\n\n46:00.740 --> 46:03.200\n how do they specify what's coming next?\n\n46:03.200 --> 46:05.280\n And then where does the novelty come from in that structure?\n\n46:05.280 --> 46:06.600\n Cause some of it is kind of things\n\n46:06.600 --> 46:09.940\n that haven't existed in the past can exist in the future.\n\n46:09.940 --> 46:12.800\n Let me ask about this entity that you call Sarah.\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:14.120\n Yes.\n\n46:14.120 --> 46:16.840\n I talk to myself about myself in third person sometimes.\n\n46:16.840 --> 46:17.680\n I don't know why.\n\n46:19.400 --> 46:22.400\n So maybe this is a good time to bring up consciousness.\n\n46:22.400 --> 46:23.240\n Sure.\n\n46:24.800 --> 46:26.600\n It's been here all along.\n\n46:26.600 --> 46:28.200\n Well, has it?\n\n46:28.200 --> 46:29.040\n So, I mean that's.\n\n46:29.040 --> 46:30.520\n At least in this conversation,\n\n46:30.520 --> 46:31.920\n I think I've been conscious most of it,\n\n46:31.920 --> 46:32.760\n but maybe I haven't.\n\n46:32.760 --> 46:33.600\n Well, yes.\n\n46:33.600 --> 46:34.800\n So speak for yourself.\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:37.960\n You're projecting your consciousness onto me.\n\n46:37.960 --> 46:39.720\n You don't know if I'm conscious or not.\n\n46:39.720 --> 46:41.060\n No, I don't.\n\n46:41.060 --> 46:41.900\n You're right.\n\n46:41.900 --> 46:45.120\n Is that, you talked about the physics of existence,\n\n46:45.120 --> 46:50.120\n you talked about the emergence of causality,\n\n46:50.120 --> 46:52.720\n sorry, you talked about causality and time\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:54.540\n being fundamental to the universe.\n\n46:55.520 --> 46:58.440\n Where does consciousness fit into all of this?\n\n46:58.440 --> 47:03.160\n Like, do you draw any kind of inspiration or value\n\n47:03.160 --> 47:05.400\n with the idea of panpsychism\n\n47:05.400 --> 47:09.680\n that maybe one of the things that we ought to understand\n\n47:09.680 --> 47:12.040\n is the physics of consciousness?\n\n47:12.040 --> 47:16.680\n Like one of the missing pieces in the physics view\n\n47:16.680 --> 47:20.460\n of the world is understanding the physics of consciousness.\n\n47:20.460 --> 47:24.860\n Or like that word has so many concepts underneath it,\n\n47:24.860 --> 47:29.120\n but let's put consciousness as a label\n\n47:29.120 --> 47:32.320\n on a black box of mystery that we don't understand.\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:36.560\n Do you think that black box holds the key\n\n47:36.560 --> 47:38.920\n to finally answering the question\n\n47:38.920 --> 47:40.760\n of the physics of life?\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:42.280\n The problems are absolutely related.\n\n47:42.280 --> 47:44.720\n I think most, and I'm interested in both\n\n47:44.720 --> 47:46.320\n because I'm just interested in what we are.\n\n47:46.320 --> 47:48.140\n And to me, the most interesting feature\n\n47:48.140 --> 47:49.460\n of what we are is our minds\n\n47:49.460 --> 47:51.320\n and the way they interact with our minds.\n\n47:51.320 --> 47:52.680\n Like minds are the most beautiful thing\n\n47:52.680 --> 47:53.560\n that exists in the universe.\n\n47:53.560 --> 47:55.360\n So how do they come to be?\n\n47:55.360 --> 47:56.240\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:58.480\n So when you say we, you mean humans.\n\n47:58.480 --> 48:01.560\n I mean humans right now, but that's because I'm a human.\n\n48:01.560 --> 48:02.400\n Or at least I think I am.\n\n48:02.400 --> 48:03.680\n But you think there's something special\n\n48:03.680 --> 48:05.040\n to this particular?\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:06.480\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n48:06.480 --> 48:11.280\n No, I'm not a human centric thinker.\n\n48:11.280 --> 48:12.560\n But are you one entity?\n\n48:12.560 --> 48:15.420\n You said a bunch of stuff came together to make a Sarah.\n\n48:15.420 --> 48:18.200\n Like do you think of yourself as one entity\n\n48:18.200 --> 48:20.760\n or are you just a bunch of different components?\n\n48:20.760 --> 48:24.400\n Like is there any value to understand the physics of Sarah?\n\n48:24.400 --> 48:26.360\n Or are you just a bunch of different things\n\n48:26.360 --> 48:30.080\n that are like a nice little temporary side effect?\n\n48:30.080 --> 48:33.040\n Yeah, you could think of me as a bundle of information\n\n48:33.040 --> 48:34.840\n that just became temporarily aggregated\n\n48:34.840 --> 48:36.520\n into your individual, yeah.\n\n48:36.520 --> 48:37.340\n That's fine.\n\n48:37.340 --> 48:38.320\n I agree with that view.\n\n48:38.320 --> 48:42.200\n I'll take that as a compliment actually.\n\n48:42.200 --> 48:46.560\n But nevertheless, that bundle of information\n\n48:46.560 --> 48:47.840\n has become conscious.\n\n48:47.840 --> 48:51.000\n Or at least keeps calling herself conscious.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:52.600\n Yeah, I think I'm conscious right now,\n\n48:52.600 --> 48:55.100\n but I might not be, but that's okay.\n\n48:55.100 --> 48:56.360\n Or you wouldn't know.\n\n48:56.360 --> 48:57.720\n So yeah, so this is the problem.\n\n48:57.720 --> 48:59.640\n So yeah, usually people when they're talking\n\n48:59.640 --> 49:00.920\n about consciousness are worried\n\n49:00.920 --> 49:02.280\n about the subjective experience.\n\n49:02.280 --> 49:04.140\n And so I think that's why you're saying,\n\n49:04.140 --> 49:05.100\n I don't know if you're conscious\n\n49:05.100 --> 49:06.900\n because I don't know if you're experiencing\n\n49:06.900 --> 49:08.300\n this conversation right now.\n\n49:09.280 --> 49:11.480\n And nor do you know if I'm experiencing\n\n49:11.480 --> 49:12.960\n the conversation right now.\n\n49:12.960 --> 49:14.280\n And so this is why this is called\n\n49:14.280 --> 49:15.400\n the hard problem of consciousness\n\n49:15.400 --> 49:17.520\n because it seems impenetrable from the outside\n\n49:17.520 --> 49:20.540\n to know if something's having a conscious experience.\n\n49:21.500 --> 49:24.600\n And I really like the idea of also\n\n49:24.600 --> 49:26.220\n like the hard problem of matter,\n\n49:26.220 --> 49:28.940\n which is related to the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n49:28.940 --> 49:31.600\n which is you don't know the intrinsic properties\n\n49:31.600 --> 49:33.320\n of an electron not interacting,\n\n49:33.320 --> 49:35.240\n say for example, with anything else in the universe.\n\n49:35.240 --> 49:37.680\n All the properties of anything that exists\n\n49:37.680 --> 49:39.480\n in the universe are defined by its interaction\n\n49:39.480 --> 49:40.920\n because you have to interact with it\n\n49:40.920 --> 49:42.440\n in order to be able to observe it.\n\n49:42.440 --> 49:44.520\n So we can only actually know the things\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:46.260\n that are observable from the outside.\n\n49:46.260 --> 49:47.720\n And so this is one of the reasons\n\n49:47.720 --> 49:49.400\n that consciousness is hard for science\n\n49:49.400 --> 49:51.080\n because you're asking questions\n\n49:51.080 --> 49:52.720\n about something that's subjective\n\n49:52.720 --> 49:55.460\n and supposed to be intrinsic to what that thing is\n\n49:55.460 --> 49:57.920\n as it exists and how it feels about existing.\n\n49:59.200 --> 50:02.520\n And so I have thought a lot about this problem\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:05.400\n and its relationship to the problem of life.\n\n50:05.400 --> 50:07.160\n And the only thing I can come up with\n\n50:07.160 --> 50:12.160\n to try to make that problem scientifically tractable\n\n50:12.920 --> 50:17.920\n and also relate it to how I think about the physics of life\n\n50:17.920 --> 50:20.320\n is to ask the question,\n\n50:20.320 --> 50:23.480\n are there things that can only happen in the universe\n\n50:23.480 --> 50:26.240\n because there are physical systems\n\n50:26.240 --> 50:28.760\n that have subjective experience?\n\n50:28.760 --> 50:32.640\n So does subjective experience have different causes\n\n50:32.640 --> 50:35.040\n that things that it can cause to occur\n\n50:36.320 --> 50:38.600\n that would happen in the absence of that?\n\n50:38.600 --> 50:40.080\n I don't know the answer to that question,\n\n50:40.080 --> 50:42.080\n but I think that's a meaningful way\n\n50:42.080 --> 50:43.600\n of asking the question of consciousness.\n\n50:43.600 --> 50:46.600\n I can't ask if you're having experience right now,\n\n50:46.600 --> 50:49.160\n but I can ask if you having experience right now\n\n50:49.160 --> 50:50.840\n changes something about you\n\n50:50.840 --> 50:52.840\n and the way you interact with the world.\n\n50:53.760 --> 50:56.400\n So does stuff happen?\n\n50:56.400 --> 50:59.000\n It's a good question to ask, does stuff happen\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.260\n if consciousness is?\n\n51:01.360 --> 51:03.160\n Then it's a real physical thing, right?\n\n51:03.160 --> 51:04.440\n It has physical consequences.\n\n51:04.440 --> 51:05.640\n I'm a physicist, I'm biased,\n\n51:05.640 --> 51:08.200\n so I can't get rid of that bias.\n\n51:08.200 --> 51:10.320\n It's really deeply ingrained.\n\n51:10.320 --> 51:12.080\n I've tried, but it's hard.\n\n51:12.080 --> 51:14.640\n But I mean, you're saying information is physical too.\n\n51:14.640 --> 51:16.400\n So like virtual reality, simulation,\n\n51:16.400 --> 51:18.280\n all that program is physical too in the sense of.\n\n51:18.280 --> 51:19.400\n Yes, everything's physical.\n\n51:19.400 --> 51:22.900\n It's just not physical the way it's represented in our minds.\n\n51:22.900 --> 51:25.520\n Right, so you, I love your Twitter.\n\n51:25.520 --> 51:29.720\n So you tweet these like deep thoughts, deep thoughts.\n\n51:29.720 --> 51:30.680\n That's what a theorist does\n\n51:30.680 --> 51:32.320\n when she's trying to experiment.\n\n51:33.320 --> 51:34.160\n Is tweet?\n\n51:34.160 --> 51:35.000\n Yes.\n\n51:35.000 --> 51:36.320\n It's just like sitting there.\n\n51:36.320 --> 51:38.360\n I mean, I could just imagine you sitting there\n\n51:38.360 --> 51:40.360\n for like hours and all of a sudden just like\n\n51:40.360 --> 51:43.080\n this thought comes out and you get a little\n\n51:44.440 --> 51:46.840\n like inkling into the thought process.\n\n51:46.840 --> 51:48.840\n Yeah, usually it's like when I'm running between things\n\n51:48.840 --> 51:50.960\n and not so much when I've had deep thoughts.\n\n51:50.960 --> 51:52.280\n Well, yeah, so you.\n\n51:52.280 --> 51:53.640\n Deep thoughts are hard to articulate.\n\n51:53.640 --> 51:55.320\n One of the things you tweeted is,\n\n51:55.320 --> 51:57.640\n ideologically, there are many parallels\n\n51:57.640 --> 52:01.640\n between the search for neural correlates of consciousness\n\n52:01.640 --> 52:04.260\n and for chemical correlates of life.\n\n52:04.260 --> 52:07.480\n How the neuroscience and astrobiology communities\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:10.460\n treat those correlates is entirely different.\n\n52:10.460 --> 52:14.660\n Can you elaborate against this kind of the parallels?\n\n52:14.660 --> 52:16.520\n It has to do a little bit with the consciousness\n\n52:16.520 --> 52:20.080\n and the matter thing you're talking about.\n\n52:20.080 --> 52:20.960\n Yeah, it does.\n\n52:20.960 --> 52:23.000\n And I can't remember what state of mind I was\n\n52:23.000 --> 52:24.400\n when I was actually thinking about that.\n\n52:24.400 --> 52:27.120\n But I think part of it is.\n\n52:27.120 --> 52:28.640\n I bet you never thought you were gonna have\n\n52:28.640 --> 52:29.920\n to analyze your own tweets.\n\n52:29.920 --> 52:31.040\n No, I didn't.\n\n52:31.040 --> 52:35.120\n It's an interesting historical juxtaposition of thinking.\n\n52:35.120 --> 52:38.200\n So the tweet is a historical.\n\n52:38.200 --> 52:40.200\n You're doing an assembly experiment right now\n\n52:40.200 --> 52:41.600\n because you're bringing a thought from the past\n\n52:41.600 --> 52:43.240\n into the present and trying to actually.\n\n52:43.240 --> 52:44.200\n In a lab.\n\n52:44.200 --> 52:45.440\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n52:45.440 --> 52:47.560\n This is experimental science right here\n\n52:47.560 --> 52:48.840\n on the podcast live.\n\n52:51.040 --> 52:53.720\n So go, let's see how the consciousness evolves on this one.\n\n52:53.720 --> 52:57.680\n Yeah, so in neuroscience, it's kind of accepted\n\n52:57.680 --> 53:00.480\n that we can't get at the subjective aspect\n\n53:00.480 --> 53:01.540\n of consciousness.\n\n53:01.540 --> 53:05.280\n So people are very interested in what would be a correlate\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:06.120\n of consciousness.\n\n53:06.120 --> 53:06.960\n So.\n\n53:08.840 --> 53:09.680\n What's a correlate?\n\n53:09.680 --> 53:13.240\n A correlate is a feature that relates\n\n53:13.240 --> 53:14.420\n to conscious activity.\n\n53:14.420 --> 53:18.660\n So for example, a verbal report is a correlate\n\n53:18.660 --> 53:22.880\n of consciousness because I can tell you when I'm conscious.\n\n53:22.880 --> 53:25.000\n And then when I'm sleeping, for example,\n\n53:25.000 --> 53:26.200\n I can't tell you I'm conscious.\n\n53:26.200 --> 53:28.680\n So we have this assumption that you're not conscious\n\n53:28.680 --> 53:31.840\n when you're sleeping and you're conscious when you're awake.\n\n53:31.840 --> 53:35.480\n And so that's sort of like a very obvious example,\n\n53:35.480 --> 53:38.840\n but neuroscientists, which I'm no neuroscientist\n\n53:38.840 --> 53:40.120\n and I'm not an expert in this field.\n\n53:40.120 --> 53:43.720\n So, but they have very sophisticated ways of measuring\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:45.960\n activity in our brain and trying to relate that\n\n53:45.960 --> 53:49.560\n to verbal report and other proxies for whether someone\n\n53:49.560 --> 53:51.600\n is experiencing something.\n\n53:51.600 --> 53:54.720\n And that's what is meant by neural correlates.\n\n53:54.720 --> 53:57.320\n And then, so when people are trying to think\n\n53:57.320 --> 54:02.320\n about studying consciousness or developing theories\n\n54:02.400 --> 54:06.160\n for consciousness, they often are trying to build\n\n54:06.160 --> 54:09.780\n an experimental bridge to these neural correlates,\n\n54:09.780 --> 54:11.960\n recognizing the fact that a neural correlate\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:15.120\n may or may not correspond to consciousness\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:16.640\n because that problem's hard\n\n54:16.640 --> 54:19.800\n and there's all these associated issues to it.\n\n54:19.800 --> 54:22.120\n So that's, from a neuroscience perspective,\n\n54:22.120 --> 54:23.560\n it's like fake it till you make it.\n\n54:23.560 --> 54:24.760\n So you. Pretty much, yeah.\n\n54:24.760 --> 54:27.600\n You fake whatever the correlates are and hopefully\n\n54:27.600 --> 54:32.600\n that's going to summon the thing that is consciousness.\n\n54:32.600 --> 54:33.440\n Yeah, something like that.\n\n54:33.440 --> 54:37.960\n And so the same thing on the chemical correlates of life.\n\n54:37.960 --> 54:39.880\n That sounds like, that's an awesome concept.\n\n54:39.880 --> 54:41.240\n Is that something that people?\n\n54:41.240 --> 54:42.280\n No, I just made that up.\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:43.120\n Okay.\n\n54:43.120 --> 54:43.960\n That was original to that tweet.\n\n54:43.960 --> 54:45.600\n You can cite the tweet.\n\n54:45.600 --> 54:48.300\n Maybe I'll write it in a paper someday.\n\n54:48.300 --> 54:50.600\n Chemical correlates of life, that's a good title.\n\n54:50.600 --> 54:52.920\n I mean, first of all, your paper is true\n\n54:52.920 --> 54:55.520\n that people should check out, have great titles.\n\n54:55.520 --> 54:56.360\n Thank you.\n\n54:56.360 --> 54:58.120\n Or papers you're involved with.\n\n54:58.120 --> 55:02.600\n So your tweets and titles are stellar and also your ideas,\n\n55:02.600 --> 55:04.920\n but the tweets and titles are much more important.\n\n55:04.920 --> 55:06.000\n Of course.\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:07.600\n So. Ideas will live longer.\n\n55:08.640 --> 55:10.000\n Yeah.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.240\n They're much more diffused though.\n\n55:12.240 --> 55:13.960\n Well, it's, yeah, it's the Trojan,\n\n55:13.960 --> 55:16.040\n the tweet is the Trojan horse of the idea\n\n55:16.040 --> 55:18.020\n that sticks on for a long time.\n\n55:18.020 --> 55:19.400\n Okay, so is there anything to say\n\n55:19.400 --> 55:20.840\n about the chemical correlates of life?\n\n55:20.840 --> 55:24.200\n You're saying they're similar kind of ways\n\n55:24.200 --> 55:25.700\n of thinking about it,\n\n55:25.700 --> 55:30.600\n but you mentioned about the communities.\n\n55:30.600 --> 55:33.460\n Yeah, so I think in astrobiology, it's not,\n\n55:35.500 --> 55:37.760\n there's no concept of chemical correlates of life.\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:38.960\n We don't think about it that way.\n\n55:38.960 --> 55:42.800\n We think if we find molecules that are involved in biology,\n\n55:42.800 --> 55:44.480\n we found life.\n\n55:44.480 --> 55:48.000\n So I think one of my motivations there\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:49.200\n was just to separate the fact\n\n55:49.200 --> 55:53.120\n that life has abstract properties associated to it.\n\n55:53.120 --> 55:56.400\n They become imprinted in material substrates\n\n55:57.320 --> 55:59.500\n and those substrates are correlates for that thing,\n\n55:59.500 --> 56:00.840\n but they are not necessarily\n\n56:00.840 --> 56:02.020\n the thing we're actually looking for.\n\n56:02.020 --> 56:04.000\n The thing that we're looking for is the physics\n\n56:04.000 --> 56:05.840\n that's organizing that system to begin with,\n\n56:05.840 --> 56:07.280\n not the particular molecules.\n\n56:08.320 --> 56:10.000\n In the same sense that, you know,\n\n56:10.000 --> 56:13.200\n your consciousness is not your brain.\n\n56:13.200 --> 56:16.740\n It's instantiated in your brain.\n\n56:16.740 --> 56:18.760\n You know, it has to have a physical substrate,\n\n56:18.760 --> 56:21.560\n but it's not, the matter is not the thing\n\n56:21.560 --> 56:22.400\n that you're looking at.\n\n56:22.400 --> 56:24.300\n It's some other, at least not in the way\n\n56:24.300 --> 56:26.780\n that we have come to look at matter,\n\n56:26.780 --> 56:28.600\n you know, with traditional physics and things.\n\n56:28.600 --> 56:29.600\n There's something else there\n\n56:29.600 --> 56:31.120\n and it might be this feature of history\n\n56:31.120 --> 56:31.960\n I was talking about,\n\n56:31.960 --> 56:33.840\n our time being actually, you know,\n\n56:33.840 --> 56:35.840\n physically represented there.\n\n56:35.840 --> 56:38.600\n Do you think consciousness can be engineered?\n\n56:38.600 --> 56:40.060\n Yes.\n\n56:40.060 --> 56:41.400\n In the same way that life can be engineered?\n\n56:41.400 --> 56:42.400\n Well, that was a fast answer.\n\n56:42.400 --> 56:43.360\n I didn't even think about that.\n\n56:43.360 --> 56:44.640\n That's interesting.\n\n56:44.640 --> 56:45.920\n You don't have a free will.\n\n56:45.920 --> 56:46.760\n That was predestined.\n\n56:46.760 --> 56:47.580\n No, I do have free will,\n\n56:47.580 --> 56:48.420\n but it's interesting,\n\n56:48.420 --> 56:50.920\n because I mean, you know,\n\n56:50.920 --> 56:51.920\n Now you're backtracking.\n\n56:51.920 --> 56:52.760\n No, no.\n\n56:52.760 --> 56:53.720\n And that was predestined.\n\n56:53.720 --> 56:55.760\n Yeah, no, no.\n\n56:55.760 --> 56:56.960\n No, I do believe in free will,\n\n56:56.960 --> 56:59.680\n but I also think that there's kind of an interesting,\n\n57:00.640 --> 57:03.240\n you know, like what you're speaking about consciousness.\n\n57:03.240 --> 57:04.560\n What are you consciously aware of\n\n57:04.560 --> 57:07.540\n versus like what is your subconscious brain\n\n57:07.540 --> 57:08.840\n actually processing and doing?\n\n57:08.840 --> 57:12.080\n And sometimes there's conflict between your consciousness\n\n57:12.080 --> 57:13.080\n and your subconsciousness\n\n57:13.080 --> 57:14.840\n or your consciousness is a little slower\n\n57:14.840 --> 57:16.180\n than your subconscious.\n\n57:16.180 --> 57:18.720\n And intuition is a really important feature of that.\n\n57:18.720 --> 57:20.520\n And so a lot of the ways I do my science\n\n57:20.520 --> 57:22.280\n is guided by intuition.\n\n57:22.280 --> 57:23.820\n So when I give fast answers like that,\n\n57:23.820 --> 57:24.660\n I think it's usually\n\n57:24.660 --> 57:25.760\n because I haven't really thought about them\n\n57:25.760 --> 57:29.040\n and therefore that's probably telling me something.\n\n57:29.040 --> 57:31.520\n Let's continue the deep analysis of your tweets.\n\n57:33.280 --> 57:35.880\n You said that determinism in a tweet,\n\n57:35.880 --> 57:38.520\n determinism and randomness play important roles\n\n57:38.520 --> 57:40.560\n in understanding what life is.\n\n57:40.560 --> 57:42.520\n So let me ask on this topic of free will,\n\n57:42.520 --> 57:45.680\n what is determinism, what is randomness\n\n57:45.680 --> 57:48.200\n and why the heck do they have anything to do\n\n57:48.200 --> 57:50.240\n with understanding life?\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:52.600\n Yeah, and you threw free will in there,\n\n57:52.600 --> 57:55.000\n just throwing all the stuff in the bag.\n\n57:55.000 --> 57:56.120\n Are they not related, determinism and randomness?\n\n57:56.120 --> 57:58.080\n No, no, they are related.\n\n57:58.080 --> 57:59.120\n No, no, that's all right.\n\n57:59.120 --> 58:00.320\n I was being unfair.\n\n58:00.320 --> 58:02.280\n You didn't even capitalize the tweet, by the way.\n\n58:02.280 --> 58:03.540\n It was all lowercase.\n\n58:03.540 --> 58:05.120\n I must've been angry.\n\n58:05.120 --> 58:06.320\n Oh, that was saying,\n\n58:06.320 --> 58:08.160\n can you analyze the emotion behind that?\n\n58:08.160 --> 58:09.000\n No, I actually did.\n\n58:09.000 --> 58:09.840\n Is it frustration or is it hope?\n\n58:09.840 --> 58:10.860\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n58:10.860 --> 58:14.200\n So I already argued that I don't think that can happen\n\n58:14.200 --> 58:16.120\n without that whole causal history.\n\n58:16.120 --> 58:18.440\n And so I guess in some sense,\n\n58:18.440 --> 58:23.440\n the determinism for me arises because of the causal history.\n\n58:23.440 --> 58:25.280\n And I'm not really sure actually\n\n58:25.280 --> 58:29.000\n about whether the universe is random or deterministic.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:32.120\n I just had this sort of intuition for a long time.\n\n58:32.120 --> 58:34.060\n I'm not sure if I agree with it anymore,\n\n58:34.060 --> 58:35.360\n but it's still kind of lingering\n\n58:35.360 --> 58:37.200\n and I don't know what to do with this question.\n\n58:37.200 --> 58:39.000\n But it seems to me, you know,\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.400\n so you asked the question, what is life?\n\n58:41.400 --> 58:42.840\n But you could also, why life?\n\n58:42.840 --> 58:43.680\n Why does life exist?\n\n58:43.680 --> 58:45.600\n What does the universe need life for?\n\n58:45.600 --> 58:46.800\n Not that the universe has needs,\n\n58:46.800 --> 58:48.880\n but you know, we have to anthropocentrize things sometimes\n\n58:48.880 --> 58:50.360\n to talk about them.\n\n58:50.360 --> 58:53.840\n And I had this feeling that if it was possible\n\n58:53.840 --> 58:57.240\n for a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on Mars\n\n58:57.240 --> 58:59.520\n to spontaneously fluctuate into existence,\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:01.760\n the universe didn't need life to create those objects.\n\n59:01.760 --> 59:03.340\n It wasn't necessary for their existence.\n\n59:03.340 --> 59:05.640\n It was just a random fluke event.\n\n59:05.640 --> 59:06.880\n And so somehow to me,\n\n59:06.880 --> 59:09.800\n it seems that it can't be that those things\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:11.820\n formed by random processes,\n\n59:11.820 --> 59:14.160\n they actually have to have a set of causes\n\n59:14.160 --> 59:17.280\n that accrue and form those things\n\n59:17.280 --> 59:18.820\n and they have to have that history.\n\n59:18.820 --> 59:21.000\n And so it seems to me that that life\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.080\n was somehow deeply related to the question\n\n59:24.080 --> 59:26.560\n of whether the underlying rules of our universe\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:29.080\n had randomness in them or they were fully deterministic.\n\n59:29.080 --> 59:30.600\n And in some ways you can think about life\n\n59:30.600 --> 59:33.880\n as being the most deterministic part of physics\n\n59:33.880 --> 59:38.880\n because it's where the causes are precise in some sense.\n\n59:39.320 --> 59:40.320\n Or most stable.\n\n59:40.320 --> 59:41.160\n So like I'm trying...\n\n59:41.160 --> 59:42.960\n Most stable, yes, most reliable.\n\n59:42.960 --> 59:47.120\n Most reliable for the tools of physics.\n\n59:47.120 --> 59:50.680\n But where's the randomness come from then?\n\n59:50.680 --> 59:54.400\n Okay, so you were speaking with...\n\n59:54.400 --> 59:55.760\n I've gone in a tangent,\n\n59:55.760 --> 59:57.040\n so I'm not sure where we are in the...\n\n59:57.040 --> 59:57.880\n Yeah.\n\n59:58.840 --> 1:00:00.840\n All of the universe is a kind of tangent.\n\n1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.320\n So we're embracing the tangent.\n\n1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:08.240\n So free will, you believe at this current time\n\n1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:09.400\n that you have free will.\n\n1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:11.080\n I believe my whole life I have free will.\n\n1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:11.920\n What is illusion?\n\n1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:12.760\n No, just kidding.\n\n1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:14.320\n I still believe it.\n\n1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:15.160\n You still believe it.\n\n1:00:15.160 --> 1:00:18.880\n So at the same time you think that\n\n1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:20.840\n in your conception of the universe,\n\n1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:23.160\n causality seems to be pretty fundamental.\n\n1:00:23.160 --> 1:00:24.000\n That's right.\n\n1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:27.360\n Which kind of wants the universe to be deterministic.\n\n1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:31.220\n So how the heck do you think you have a free will\n\n1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.340\n and yet you value causality?\n\n1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.760\n Because I depart from the conception of physics\n\n1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:42.760\n that you can write down an initial condition\n\n1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:45.720\n and a fixed law of motion and that will describe everything.\n\n1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:47.160\n There's no incompatibility\n\n1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:49.520\n if you are willing to reject that assertion.\n\n1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:51.160\n So where's the randomness?\n\n1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:54.160\n Where's the magic that gives birth to the free will?\n\n1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:56.840\n Is it the randomness of the laws of physics?\n\n1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:00.080\n No, in my mind what free will is,\n\n1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:03.240\n is the fact that I as a physical system\n\n1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:05.360\n have causal control over certain things.\n\n1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:06.960\n I don't have causal control over everything,\n\n1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:09.040\n but I have a certain set of things.\n\n1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:12.080\n And I'm also, as I described,\n\n1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:15.320\n sort of a nexus of a particular set of histories\n\n1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:16.240\n that exist in the universe\n\n1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:18.600\n and a particular set of futures that might exist.\n\n1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.360\n And those futures that might exist are in part specified\n\n1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:25.800\n by my physical configuration as me.\n\n1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:29.500\n And therefore, it may not be free will\n\n1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:30.720\n in the traditional sense.\n\n1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:31.920\n I don't even know what people mean\n\n1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.400\n when they're talking about free will, honestly.\n\n1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:35.460\n It's like the whole discussion's really muddled.\n\n1:01:35.460 --> 1:01:38.320\n But in the sense that I am a causal agent,\n\n1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.720\n if you wanna call it that, that exists in the universe,\n\n1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:42.160\n and there are certain things that happen\n\n1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:45.600\n because I exist as me, then yes, I have free will.\n\n1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:50.060\n No, but do you, Sarah, have a choice\n\n1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:51.600\n about what's going to happen next?\n\n1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.400\n Oh, I see.\n\n1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:55.600\n If the universe, could I have,\n\n1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:57.400\n if I run this universe. Yes, I think so.\n\n1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:58.600\n You have a choice.\n\n1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:00.240\n Where does the choice come from?\n\n1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:02.280\n I think that's related to the physics of consciousness.\n\n1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:03.960\n So one of the things I didn't say about that,\n\n1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:06.800\n I don't know, maybe this is me just being hopeful\n\n1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:08.640\n because maybe I just wanna have free will,\n\n1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:10.800\n but I don't think that we can rule out the possibility\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.020\n because I don't think that we understand enough\n\n1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:14.440\n about any of these problems.\n\n1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.400\n But I think one of the things that's interesting for me\n\n1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:18.840\n about the sort of inversion of the question\n\n1:02:18.840 --> 1:02:21.040\n of consciousness that I proposed\n\n1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:24.080\n is one of the features that we do\n\n1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:27.000\n is we have imagination, right?\n\n1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.520\n And people don't think about imagination\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.760\n as a physical thing, but it is a physical thing.\n\n1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:32.480\n It exists in the universe, right?\n\n1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:35.560\n And so I'm like really intrigued by the fact that say,\n\n1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:38.720\n humans for, another physical system could do this too,\n\n1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:39.760\n it's not special to humans,\n\n1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:44.220\n but for centuries imagined flying machines and rockets,\n\n1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:45.760\n and then we finally built them, right?\n\n1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:47.640\n So they were represented in our minds\n\n1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:50.040\n and on the pages of things that we drew\n\n1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:51.840\n for hundreds of years before we could build\n\n1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:54.040\n those physical objects in the universe.\n\n1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:56.480\n But certainly the existence of rockets\n\n1:02:56.480 --> 1:02:59.900\n is in part causally,\n\n1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:03.640\n caused by the fact that we could imagine them.\n\n1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:07.920\n And so there seems to be this property\n\n1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.880\n that some things don't exist,\n\n1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:12.080\n they've never physically existed in the universe,\n\n1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:14.680\n but we can imagine the possibility of them existing\n\n1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:16.520\n and then cause them to exist,\n\n1:03:16.520 --> 1:03:18.480\n maybe individually or collectively.\n\n1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:21.000\n And I think that property is related\n\n1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.180\n to what I would say about having choice or free will,\n\n1:03:23.180 --> 1:03:25.440\n because that set of possibilities,\n\n1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:27.360\n those set of things that you can imagine\n\n1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:29.720\n is not constrained to your local physical environment\n\n1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:30.560\n and history.\n\n1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:32.000\n And this is what's a little bit different\n\n1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.440\n about intelligence as we see it in humans\n\n1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:37.820\n and AI that we wanna build than biological intelligence,\n\n1:03:37.820 --> 1:03:40.680\n because biological intelligence is predicated completely\n\n1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:42.500\n on the history of things that's seen in the past,\n\n1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:45.400\n but something happened with the neural architectures\n\n1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.000\n that evolved in multicellular organisms\n\n1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.400\n that they don't just have access to the past history\n\n1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:52.400\n of their particular set of events,\n\n1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:55.120\n but they can imagine things that haven't happened,\n\n1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:56.180\n aren't on their timeline,\n\n1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:58.080\n and as long as they're consistent with the laws of physics,\n\n1:03:58.080 --> 1:03:59.560\n make them happen.\n\n1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:02.360\n So this is fascinating.\n\n1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:05.400\n It's trippy physics, but it exists, so there you go.\n\n1:04:05.400 --> 1:04:06.400\n I mean, in some sense,\n\n1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:10.040\n if you look at like general relativity and gravity\n\n1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:12.800\n morphing space time in that same way,\n\n1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:16.200\n maybe whatever the physics of consciousness might be,\n\n1:04:16.200 --> 1:04:18.760\n it might be morphing, that's like what free will is.\n\n1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:21.600\n It's morphing like the space,\n\n1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:25.000\n just like ideas make rockets come to life.\n\n1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:30.000\n It's somehow changing the space of possible realizations\n\n1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:33.520\n of like whatever's, yeah, okay, but that's.\n\n1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:35.560\n Life is kind of basically, if you wanna think about it,\n\n1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:38.480\n like life is sort of changing the probability distributions\n\n1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:39.320\n over what can exist.\n\n1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:40.960\n That's the physics of what life is.\n\n1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:43.440\n And then consciousness is this sort of layered property\n\n1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.160\n or imagination on top of it\n\n1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:47.240\n that kind of scrambles that a little bit more\n\n1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:50.320\n and like has access to, I don't know.\n\n1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:53.040\n It's kind of, we don't know how to describe it, right?\n\n1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:54.200\n Like that's why it's interesting, but.\n\n1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:55.320\n But it's probabilistic.\n\n1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:57.440\n So you do think like God plays dice.\n\n1:04:57.440 --> 1:04:58.560\n So let me.\n\n1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:00.520\n No, I think the description is probabilistic.\n\n1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:02.320\n I don't necessarily think\n\n1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.280\n the underlying physics is probabilistic.\n\n1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:09.520\n I think the way that we can describe this physics\n\n1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:12.240\n is going to be probabilistic and statistical,\n\n1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:14.720\n but the under, like when we take measurements in the lab,\n\n1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:15.960\n but the underlying physics itself\n\n1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:17.080\n might still be deterministic.\n\n1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.440\n I don't know.\n\n1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:22.320\n Maybe I'm, it's hard to know what concepts to hold on to.\n\n1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:24.760\n So I find myself constantly rejecting concepts,\n\n1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:26.160\n but then I have to grab another one\n\n1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:29.640\n and try to hold onto something from intellectual history.\n\n1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:30.800\n Well, it's possible that our mind\n\n1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.360\n is not able to hold the correct concepts in mind at all.\n\n1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:36.080\n Like we're not able to even conceive of them correctly.\n\n1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:39.000\n Maybe the word's deterministic or random\n\n1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.360\n or not the right even words, concepts to be holding.\n\n1:05:42.360 --> 1:05:46.600\n But maybe you can talk to the theory of everything,\n\n1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:49.320\n this attempt in the current set of physical laws\n\n1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:50.880\n to try to unify them.\n\n1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:55.280\n Is there any hope that once a theory of everything\n\n1:05:55.280 --> 1:05:56.840\n is developed, and by theory of everything,\n\n1:05:56.840 --> 1:06:00.280\n I mean in a narrow sense of unifying quantum field theory\n\n1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:01.520\n and general relativity,\n\n1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:04.320\n do you think that will contain some,\n\n1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:08.440\n like in order to do that unification,\n\n1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.760\n you would have to get something\n\n1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:13.280\n that would then give hints about the physics of life,\n\n1:06:13.280 --> 1:06:15.880\n physics of existence, physics of consciousness.\n\n1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:18.800\n Yeah, I used to not, but I actually,\n\n1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:23.800\n I have become increasingly convinced that it probably will.\n\n1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.960\n And part of the reason is,\n\n1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.600\n I think I've talked a little bit already\n\n1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:29.280\n about these holes in physics,\n\n1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:32.840\n like the theories we have in physics,\n\n1:06:32.840 --> 1:06:35.360\n they have problems, they have lots of problems\n\n1:06:35.360 --> 1:06:37.120\n and they're very deep problems\n\n1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:39.040\n and we don't know how to patch them.\n\n1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:41.200\n And some of those problems become very evident\n\n1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.440\n when you try to patch quantum mechanics\n\n1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:45.680\n and general relativity together.\n\n1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:47.520\n So there is this kind of interesting feature\n\n1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.840\n that some of the ways of patching that\n\n1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:54.200\n might actually closely resemble the physics of life.\n\n1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.440\n And so the place where that actually comes up most,\n\n1:06:56.440 --> 1:06:58.120\n and actually we just had a workshop\n\n1:06:58.120 --> 1:06:59.040\n in the Beyond Center where I work\n\n1:06:59.040 --> 1:07:00.600\n at Arizona State University,\n\n1:07:00.600 --> 1:07:02.760\n and Lee Smolin made this point that he thinks\n\n1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:05.080\n that the theory of quantum gravity when we solve it\n\n1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:08.440\n is gonna be the same theory that gives rise to life.\n\n1:07:08.440 --> 1:07:11.440\n And I think that I agree with him on some levels\n\n1:07:11.440 --> 1:07:13.720\n because there's something very interesting where,\n\n1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:17.280\n if you look at these sort of causal set theories of gravity\n\n1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.840\n where they're looking for space as being emergent.\n\n1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:24.640\n And so space time is an emergent concept from a causal set,\n\n1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:26.440\n which is also sort of related, I think,\n\n1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:29.200\n to what Wolfram's doing with his physics project.\n\n1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:30.800\n It's the same kind of underlying math\n\n1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:32.920\n that we have in this theory that we've been developing\n\n1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:35.200\n related to life called assembly theory,\n\n1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:39.800\n which is basically trying to look at complex objects\n\n1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:44.160\n like molecules and bacteria and living things\n\n1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:49.160\n as basically being assembled from a set of component parts\n\n1:07:52.280 --> 1:07:54.640\n and that they actually encode all the possible histories\n\n1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:56.640\n that they could have in that physical object.\n\n1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.480\n So mathematically, all these ideas I think are related.\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:00.680\n I think a lot of people are thinking about this\n\n1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:02.280\n from different perspectives.\n\n1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:04.440\n And then constructor theory that David Deutsch\n\n1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.960\n and Chiara Marletto have been developing\n\n1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:07.560\n is a totally different angle on it,\n\n1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:09.120\n but I think getting at some similar ideas.\n\n1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.200\n So it's a really interesting time right now, I think,\n\n1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.680\n for the frontiers of physics and how it's relating\n\n1:08:13.680 --> 1:08:15.920\n to maybe deeper principles about what life is.\n\n1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:17.120\n So short answer, yes.\n\n1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:19.200\n Long winded answer, rewind.\n\n1:08:20.760 --> 1:08:22.760\n Can we talk about aliens?\n\n1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:23.600\n Anytime.\n\n1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:28.920\n So one, I think one interesting way to sneak up\n\n1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:33.240\n on the question of what is life is to ask\n\n1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:36.120\n what should we look for in alien life?\n\n1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:42.440\n If we were to look out into our galaxy and into the universe\n\n1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:47.440\n and come up with a framework of how to detect alien life,\n\n1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:49.600\n what should we be looking for?\n\n1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:54.600\n Is there like set of rules, like it's both the tools\n\n1:08:55.400 --> 1:08:59.000\n and the tools that are service sensors\n\n1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.640\n for certain kind of properties of life.\n\n1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:05.400\n So what should we look for in alien life?\n\n1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:08.000\n Yeah, so we have a paper actually coming out on Monday,\n\n1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.600\n which is collaboration.\n\n1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:11.640\n It's actually really Lee Cronin's lab,\n\n1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:12.920\n but my group worked with him on it\n\n1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:13.840\n and we're working on the theory,\n\n1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.040\n which is this idea that we should look for life\n\n1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:20.280\n as high assembly objects.\n\n1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:22.120\n What we mean by that is,\n\n1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:24.360\n which is actually observationally measurable.\n\n1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:26.120\n And this is one of the reasons that I started working\n\n1:09:26.120 --> 1:09:28.760\n with Lee on these ideas is because being a theorist,\n\n1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:29.920\n it's easy to work in a vacuum.\n\n1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:32.520\n It's very hard to connect abstract ideas\n\n1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:34.120\n about the nature of life to anything\n\n1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:35.720\n that's experimentally tractable.\n\n1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:41.080\n But what his lab has been able to do is develop this method\n\n1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.120\n where they look at a molecule\n\n1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:46.160\n and they break it apart into all its component parts.\n\n1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:47.040\n And so you say you used to have\n\n1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:48.400\n some elementary building blocks\n\n1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:51.160\n and you can build up all the ways of putting those together\n\n1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:52.680\n to make the original object.\n\n1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:55.240\n And then you look for the shortest path in that space.\n\n1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:59.120\n And you say that's sort of the assembly number\n\n1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:00.920\n associated to that object.\n\n1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:02.880\n And if that number is higher,\n\n1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:05.840\n it assumes that a longer causal history\n\n1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:07.480\n is necessary to produce that object\n\n1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.600\n or more information is necessary to specify\n\n1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:11.440\n the creation of that object in the universe.\n\n1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:14.160\n Now, that kind of idea at a superficial level\n\n1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:15.800\n has existed for a long time.\n\n1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:19.200\n That kind of idea as a physical observable of molecules\n\n1:10:19.200 --> 1:10:20.800\n is completely novel.\n\n1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.800\n And what his lab has been able to show\n\n1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.520\n is that if you look at a bunch of samples\n\n1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.800\n of nonbiological things and biological things,\n\n1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.320\n there's this kind of threshold of assembly\n\n1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:34.880\n where as far as the experimental evidence is\n\n1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:38.040\n and also your intuitive intuition would suggest\n\n1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:41.160\n that nonbiological systems don't produce things\n\n1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:43.160\n with high assembly number.\n\n1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:44.680\n So this goes back to the idea\n\n1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:47.040\n like a protein is not gonna spontaneously fluctuate\n\n1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:48.680\n into existence on the surface of Mars.\n\n1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:50.120\n It requires an evolutionary process\n\n1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:52.640\n and a biological architecture to produce a protein.\n\n1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:54.480\n You generalize that argument,\n\n1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:58.800\n a complex molecule or a cup or a desk ornament\n\n1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:01.960\n in this sort of abstract idea of assembly spaces\n\n1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:04.560\n as being the causal history of objects.\n\n1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:06.240\n And you can talk about the shortest path\n\n1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:08.440\n from elementary objects to an object\n\n1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.960\n given an elementary set of operations.\n\n1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:14.240\n And you can experimentally measure that with mass spec.\n\n1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:16.640\n And that's basically the sort of the idea.\n\n1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:17.640\n That's really fascinating.\n\n1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:19.040\n I can't get out of my head.\n\n1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:20.840\n I'd start imagining Legos\n\n1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:23.320\n and all the Legos I've ever built and how many steps,\n\n1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:28.320\n what is the shortest path to the final little Lego castles?\n\n1:11:28.440 --> 1:11:31.800\n So then like asking about going to look for alien life,\n\n1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:35.560\n the idea is most of the instruments that NASA builds,\n\n1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:37.460\n for example, or any of the space agencies\n\n1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:38.580\n looking for life in the universe\n\n1:11:38.580 --> 1:11:41.980\n are looking for chemical correlates of life, right?\n\n1:11:41.980 --> 1:11:43.360\n But here we have something\n\n1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.280\n that is based on properties of molecules.\n\n1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:49.120\n It's not a chemical correlate, it's agnostic.\n\n1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.520\n It doesn't care about the molecule.\n\n1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:53.760\n It cares about what is the history\n\n1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:56.300\n necessary to produce this molecule?\n\n1:11:56.300 --> 1:11:58.760\n How complex is it in terms of how much time is needing,\n\n1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:00.840\n how much information is required to produce it?\n\n1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:04.180\n So when you observe a thing on another planet,\n\n1:12:04.180 --> 1:12:06.480\n you're essentially,\n\n1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:08.520\n the process looks like a reverse engineering,\n\n1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:10.480\n trying to figure out what is the shortest path\n\n1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:11.600\n to create that thing.\n\n1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:14.280\n Yeah, so most, yeah, and I would say most,\n\n1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:16.680\n like most examples of biology or technology\n\n1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:18.080\n don't take the shortest path, right?\n\n1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:20.120\n But the shortest path is a bound on how hard it is\n\n1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:21.640\n for the universe to make that.\n\n1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:25.080\n Yeah, and I guess what you and Lee are saying\n\n1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:26.560\n that there's a heuristic,\n\n1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.280\n that's a good metric for like better perhaps\n\n1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:31.600\n than chemical correlates.\n\n1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:34.640\n Yes, because it doesn't, it's not contingent\n\n1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:37.480\n on looking for the chemistry of life on earth,\n\n1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:38.960\n on other planets.\n\n1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:42.040\n And it also has a deeper explanatory framework\n\n1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:43.360\n associated to it,\n\n1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:45.720\n as far as the kind of theory that we're trying to develop\n\n1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:47.320\n associated to what life is.\n\n1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.940\n And I think this is one of the problems I have\n\n1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:51.680\n in my field personally in astrobiology\n\n1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:53.960\n is people observe something on earth,\n\n1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:58.520\n say oxygen in the atmosphere or an amino acid in a cell,\n\n1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:02.280\n and then they say, let's go look for that on another planet.\n\n1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:04.080\n Let's look for oxygen on exoplanets\n\n1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.360\n or let's look for amino acids on Mars.\n\n1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:09.080\n And then they assume that's a way of looking for life\n\n1:13:12.140 --> 1:13:13.560\n or even phosphine on Venus.\n\n1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:15.240\n But you know, like there's all these examples\n\n1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:17.240\n of let's look for one molecule.\n\n1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:18.440\n A molecule is not life.\n\n1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:21.840\n Life is a system that patterns particular structures\n\n1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:22.680\n into matter.\n\n1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:24.460\n That's like, that's what it is.\n\n1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:26.760\n And it doesn't care what molecules are there.\n\n1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:29.160\n It's something about the patterns and that structure\n\n1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:30.160\n and that history.\n\n1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.220\n And if you're looking for a molecule,\n\n1:13:33.220 --> 1:13:34.680\n you're not testing any hypotheses\n\n1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:36.160\n about the nature of what life is.\n\n1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:37.440\n It doesn't tell me anything.\n\n1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:39.000\n If we discover oxygen on an exoplanet\n\n1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.200\n about what kind of life is there,\n\n1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:42.040\n just oxygen on an exoplanet.\n\n1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:45.480\n It's not, there's, I guess I think like,\n\n1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:46.640\n when you think about the question,\n\n1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:47.800\n are we alone in the universe?\n\n1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.520\n That's a pretty fricking deep question.\n\n1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.040\n It should have a fricking deep answer.\n\n1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:53.000\n It shouldn't just be, there's a molecule on an exoplanet.\n\n1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.520\n Wow, we solved the problem.\n\n1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:56.560\n It should tell us something meaningful about our existence.\n\n1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:59.000\n And I feel like we've fallen short\n\n1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.200\n on how we're searching for life\n\n1:14:01.200 --> 1:14:05.260\n in terms of actually searching for things like us\n\n1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:06.960\n in this kind of deeper way.\n\n1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.360\n But how do you do that initial kind of,\n\n1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:12.060\n say I'm walking down the street\n\n1:14:12.060 --> 1:14:15.520\n and I'm looking for that double take test of like,\n\n1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:17.180\n like what the hell is that?\n\n1:14:17.180 --> 1:14:22.180\n Like that initial, like how do we look for\n\n1:14:22.220 --> 1:14:24.160\n the possibility of weirdness\n\n1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.480\n or the possibility of high assembly number?\n\n1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:27.320\n Well, yeah.\n\n1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:29.680\n Like what would aliens look like\n\n1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:32.760\n if they don't have two eyes and are green?\n\n1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:35.520\n If I knew, I wouldn't probably already solve the problem.\n\n1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:37.640\n Right, there's another Nobel Prize in there somewhere.\n\n1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.880\n Yeah, somewhere in there.\n\n1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.280\n Well, I think it's kind of,\n\n1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:43.160\n so there is a bias here, right?\n\n1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:45.920\n So we've evolved to recognize life on earth, right?\n\n1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:48.600\n Like I, you know, children at a very early age\n\n1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:50.640\n can tell the difference between a puppy and a plant\n\n1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.400\n and then the plant and a chair, for example.\n\n1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:55.720\n You know, like it just, it seems innate.\n\n1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:58.540\n And so I think, and also because we're life,\n\n1:14:59.920 --> 1:15:02.560\n you know, I think like there's this implicit bias\n\n1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:03.880\n that we should know it when we see it\n\n1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:06.780\n and it should be completely obvious to us.\n\n1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:08.940\n But there are a lot of features of our universe\n\n1:15:08.940 --> 1:15:10.380\n that are not completely obvious to us.\n\n1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:12.380\n Like the fact that this table is made of atoms\n\n1:15:12.380 --> 1:15:13.720\n and that I'm sitting\n\n1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:16.080\n in a gravitational potential well right now.\n\n1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:19.440\n And I guess my point with this is,\n\n1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:23.240\n I think life is much less obvious than we think it is.\n\n1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:25.280\n And so it could be in many more forms\n\n1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.080\n than we think it is.\n\n1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:28.720\n And I guess this goes back to the point\n\n1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:30.000\n about being open minded\n\n1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:33.000\n that we may not know what alien life looks like.\n\n1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.480\n It might not even be possible to interact with alien life\n\n1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:38.520\n because maybe something about, you know,\n\n1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:41.240\n our informational lineage, it makes it impossible\n\n1:15:41.240 --> 1:15:43.880\n for information from an alien to be copied to us.\n\n1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:46.040\n Therefore there's no, you know,\n\n1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:47.800\n so to speak communication channel.\n\n1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:49.840\n And I don't mean, you know, verbal communication,\n\n1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:52.960\n just it's not in our observational space.\n\n1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:56.240\n Like, you know, there's fundamental questions\n\n1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:58.120\n about why we observe the universe in position\n\n1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:00.800\n rather than momentum, but we also, you know,\n\n1:16:00.800 --> 1:16:03.120\n observe it in terms of certain informational patterns\n\n1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:04.980\n and things like that's what our brain constructs\n\n1:16:04.980 --> 1:16:07.280\n and maybe aliens just interact\n\n1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:08.640\n with a different part of reality than we do.\n\n1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:11.040\n That's wildly speculative, but I think, I think.\n\n1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:12.840\n But it's possible.\n\n1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:15.140\n It's possible and I think it's consistent with the physics.\n\n1:16:15.140 --> 1:16:17.160\n So I think the best ways we can ask questions\n\n1:16:17.160 --> 1:16:19.600\n are about life and chemistry\n\n1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:20.880\n and asking questions about\n\n1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:23.360\n if information is a real physical thing,\n\n1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.600\n what would its signatures be in matter\n\n1:16:26.900 --> 1:16:28.960\n and how do we recognize those?\n\n1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:31.540\n And I think the ones that are most obvious\n\n1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:33.080\n are the ones I've already articulated.\n\n1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:35.680\n You have these objects that seem completely improbable\n\n1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:36.900\n for the universe to produce\n\n1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:39.120\n because the universe doesn't have the design\n\n1:16:39.120 --> 1:16:40.960\n of that object in the laws.\n\n1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:44.500\n So therefore an object had to evolve.\n\n1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:46.720\n We talk, we call it evolution,\n\n1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.480\n but it had to be produced by the universe\n\n1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:51.360\n that then had all of the possible tasks\n\n1:16:51.360 --> 1:16:54.680\n to make that object specified.\n\n1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:55.520\n I mean, there's some,\n\n1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:59.120\n like there's an engineering question here of,\n\n1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.080\n are there sensors we can create that can give us,\n\n1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:05.720\n can help us discover certain pockets\n\n1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:08.440\n of high assemblies aliens?\n\n1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:10.880\n Like, I mean, there is a hope\n\n1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:14.640\n setting dogs and chairs aside,\n\n1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:19.480\n there's a hope that visually we could detect,\n\n1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:22.880\n like, because our universe,\n\n1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:24.480\n I mean, at least the way we look at it now,\n\n1:17:24.480 --> 1:17:27.240\n like this three dimensional like space time,\n\n1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:29.360\n we can visually comprehend it.\n\n1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:31.280\n It's interesting to think like,\n\n1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:33.040\n if we got to hang out,\n\n1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:34.840\n if there's an alien in this room,\n\n1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:39.360\n like would we be able to detect it with our current sensors?\n\n1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:41.960\n Not the fancy kinds, but like web cam.\n\n1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.320\n Like say standing over there.\n\n1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:44.440\n Yeah, standing over there\n\n1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:45.880\n or maybe like in this carpet,\n\n1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:48.200\n see there's all these kinds of patterns, right?\n\n1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:52.880\n I don't know if this carpet is an alien.\n\n1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.160\n Well, so I see what you're saying.\n\n1:17:56.200 --> 1:17:57.800\n So assembly theory is pretty general.\n\n1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:00.040\n Like, I mean, we've been applying it to molecules\n\n1:18:00.040 --> 1:18:02.160\n because it makes sense to apply it to molecules,\n\n1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:05.080\n but it's supposed to explain life,\n\n1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:07.200\n like the physics of life.\n\n1:18:07.200 --> 1:18:09.280\n So it should explain the things in this room\n\n1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:11.280\n in addition to molecules.\n\n1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:14.640\n So I guess, and you can apply it to images and things.\n\n1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.600\n So I guess the idea you could explore\n\n1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:21.280\n is just looking at everything on planet earth\n\n1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:23.200\n in terms of its assembly structure\n\n1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:24.960\n and then looking for things\n\n1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:27.080\n that aren't part of our biological lineage.\n\n1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:29.440\n If they have high assembly, they might be aliens on earth.\n\n1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:31.320\n I mean, that is a very kind of rigorous\n\n1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.320\n computer vision question.\n\n1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:36.640\n Can we visually, is there a strong correlation\n\n1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.600\n between certain kind of high assembly objects\n\n1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:39.880\n when they get to the scale\n\n1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:42.080\n where they're visually observable\n\n1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:47.080\n and some, like when it's say projected onto a 2D plane,\n\n1:18:47.240 --> 1:18:49.720\n can we figure out something?\n\n1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:51.480\n I'm glad you brought up the computer vision point\n\n1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:53.560\n because for a while I had this kind of thought in my mind\n\n1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:55.200\n that we can't even see ourselves clearly.\n\n1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.520\n So one of the things,\n\n1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:57.960\n people are worried about artificial intelligence\n\n1:18:57.960 --> 1:18:58.800\n for a lot of reasons,\n\n1:18:58.800 --> 1:18:59.880\n but I think it's really fascinating\n\n1:18:59.880 --> 1:19:03.320\n because it's like the first time in history\n\n1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:04.440\n that we're building a system\n\n1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.360\n that can help us understand ourselves.\n\n1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:08.560\n So like, people talk about AI physics,\n\n1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:12.520\n but like, when I look at another person,\n\n1:19:12.520 --> 1:19:15.400\n I don't see them as a 4 billion year lineage,\n\n1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:16.360\n but that's what they are.\n\n1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:18.160\n And so is everything here, right?\n\n1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.440\n So imagine that we built artificial systems\n\n1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:24.280\n that could actually see that feature of us,\n\n1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:25.640\n what else would they see?\n\n1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:28.680\n And I think that's what you're asking.\n\n1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:31.840\n And I think that would be so cool.\n\n1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:35.360\n I want that to happen,\n\n1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:38.600\n but I think we're a little ways off from it, but yeah.\n\n1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:40.200\n We're going there, I hope.\n\n1:19:40.200 --> 1:19:43.400\n Okay, let me ask you, I apologize ahead of time,\n\n1:19:43.400 --> 1:19:45.160\n but let me ask you the internet question.\n\n1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:46.200\n So you're a physicist,\n\n1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:49.640\n you ask rigorous questions about the physics of existence\n\n1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:52.840\n and these models of high assembly objects.\n\n1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:55.160\n Now, when the internet would see an alien,\n\n1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:56.440\n they would ask two questions.\n\n1:19:56.440 --> 1:19:58.080\n One, can I eat it?\n\n1:19:58.080 --> 1:19:59.960\n And two, can I have sex with it?\n\n1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:00.800\n Yes.\n\n1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:02.440\n So, the internet is.\n\n1:20:02.440 --> 1:20:04.560\n All the existential questions,\n\n1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:05.400\n those are very important ones.\n\n1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:07.400\n The internet is very sophisticated.\n\n1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:10.600\n It really is, it's gotten our basal cognition pretty good.\n\n1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:12.600\n So you kind of mentioned that it's very difficult.\n\n1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:14.360\n It's possible that we may not be\n\n1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:16.080\n even able to communicate with it.\n\n1:20:16.080 --> 1:20:18.560\n Right, I think the internet has more hope than we do.\n\n1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.040\n Yeah, it's a hopeful place, yes.\n\n1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:23.680\n Do you think in terms of interacting\n\n1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:27.720\n on this very primal level of sharing resources,\n\n1:20:27.720 --> 1:20:28.880\n like what would aliens eat?\n\n1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:29.880\n What would we eat?\n\n1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:31.400\n Would we eat the same thing?\n\n1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.880\n Could we potentially eat each other?\n\n1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:37.240\n One person eats the other, or the aliens eat us.\n\n1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.960\n And the same thing with not sex in general,\n\n1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:42.360\n or reproduction, but genetically mixing stuff.\n\n1:20:42.360 --> 1:20:46.560\n Like, would we be able to mix genetic information?\n\n1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:48.760\n Maybe not genetic, but maybe information, right?\n\n1:20:48.760 --> 1:20:50.520\n And I think part of your question is like,\n\n1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:54.200\n so if you think of life as like this history\n\n1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:55.600\n of events that happen in the universe,\n\n1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:56.960\n like there's this question of like,\n\n1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.320\n how divergent are those histories, right?\n\n1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:00.920\n So when we get to the scale of technology,\n\n1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:02.920\n it's possible to imagine,\n\n1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:04.080\n although we can't even do it.\n\n1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:05.720\n Like imagine all the possible technologies\n\n1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:06.840\n that could exist in the universe.\n\n1:21:06.840 --> 1:21:08.600\n But if you think about all the possible chemistries,\n\n1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:10.840\n somehow that seems like a lower dimensional space\n\n1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:12.720\n and a lower set of possibilities.\n\n1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:15.840\n So it might be that like when we interact with aliens,\n\n1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:19.080\n we do have to go back to those more basal levels\n\n1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:22.680\n to figure out sort of what the map is, right?\n\n1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.640\n Like the sort of where we have a common history.\n\n1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:28.800\n We must have a common history somewhere in the universe,\n\n1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:31.360\n but in order to be able to actually interact\n\n1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:33.560\n in a meaningful way, you have to have some shared history.\n\n1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:35.560\n I mean, the reason we can exchange genetic information\n\n1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:39.080\n in each other's food or eat each other as food\n\n1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:40.720\n is because we have a shared history.\n\n1:21:40.720 --> 1:21:42.680\n So we have to find that shared history.\n\n1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:44.240\n We have to find the common ancestor\n\n1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:47.160\n in this causality map, the causality tree.\n\n1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:49.600\n Yes, and we have a last universal common ancestor\n\n1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:51.840\n for all life on earth, which I think is sort of the nexus\n\n1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:54.080\n of that causality map for life on earth.\n\n1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:56.880\n But the question is where would other aliens\n\n1:21:56.880 --> 1:21:58.200\n diverge on that map?\n\n1:21:58.200 --> 1:21:59.040\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:03.600\n And I mean, so say there's a lot of aliens out there\n\n1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:07.000\n in the universe, each set of organisms\n\n1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.800\n will probably have like a number, you know,\n\n1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:13.120\n like Erdos number of like how far,\n\n1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:15.960\n like how far our common ancestor is.\n\n1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:19.600\n And so the closer the common ancestor, like it is on earth,\n\n1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:22.280\n the more likely we are to be able\n\n1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:24.120\n to have sexual reproduction.\n\n1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:26.080\n Well, it's like sort of like humans having common culture\n\n1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:27.120\n and languages, right?\n\n1:22:27.120 --> 1:22:27.960\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:32.360\n Yeah, it might take a lot of work though with an alien\n\n1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:35.600\n cause you really have to get over a language barrier.\n\n1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:36.640\n Oh boy.\n\n1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:40.080\n So it's communication, it's resources.\n\n1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:41.640\n I mean, it's all the whole,\n\n1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:46.320\n and I think tied into that is the questions\n\n1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:48.160\n of like who's going to harm who.\n\n1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:49.000\n Right.\n\n1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:49.840\n And actually definitions of harm.\n\n1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:50.920\n And whether your parents approve,\n\n1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.800\n you know, all those kind of questions.\n\n1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.600\n Whether the common ancestor approves.\n\n1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:58.040\n Yeah, that's just very true.\n\n1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:00.880\n How many alien civilizations do you think are out there?\n\n1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.920\n I don't have intuition for that,\n\n1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:07.440\n which I have always thought was deeply intriguing.\n\n1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:11.440\n So, and part of this, I mean, I say it specifically\n\n1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:12.720\n as I don't have intuition for that\n\n1:23:12.720 --> 1:23:14.160\n because it's like one of those questions\n\n1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:15.480\n that you feel around for a while\n\n1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:19.360\n and you really just, you can't see it\n\n1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:20.880\n even though it might be right there.\n\n1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:24.200\n And in that sense, it's a little like\n\n1:23:24.200 --> 1:23:25.840\n the quantum to classical can transition.\n\n1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:26.760\n You're like really talking about\n\n1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:28.000\n two different kinds of physics.\n\n1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.360\n And I think that's kind of part of the problem.\n\n1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:30.400\n Once we understand the physics,\n\n1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:33.040\n that question might become more meaningful.\n\n1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:34.760\n But there's also this other issue,\n\n1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:37.720\n and this was really instilled on me\n\n1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:39.720\n by my mentor, Paul Davies, when I was a postdoc,\n\n1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:42.240\n because he always talks about how, you know,\n\n1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:45.800\n whether aliens are common or rare is kind of just,\n\n1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:49.200\n you know, it like, you know, it follows a wave of popularity\n\n1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:51.320\n and it just depends on like the mood of, you know,\n\n1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:53.160\n what the culture is at the time.\n\n1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:54.480\n And I always thought that was kind of\n\n1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:56.880\n an intriguing observation, but also there's this,\n\n1:23:56.880 --> 1:23:58.360\n you know, set of points about\n\n1:23:58.360 --> 1:23:59.920\n if you go by the observational evidence,\n\n1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:02.200\n which we're supposed to do as scientists, right?\n\n1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:08.600\n You know, we have evidence of us\n\n1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:11.560\n and one origin of life event from which we emerged.\n\n1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.080\n And people wanna make arguments\n\n1:24:13.080 --> 1:24:15.720\n that because that event was rapid\n\n1:24:15.720 --> 1:24:17.240\n or because there's other planets\n\n1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:18.720\n that have properties similar to ours,\n\n1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:20.400\n that that event should be common.\n\n1:24:20.400 --> 1:24:22.040\n But you actually can't reason on that\n\n1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:23.720\n because our existence observing that event\n\n1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:25.720\n is contingent on that event happening,\n\n1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:27.800\n which means it could have been completely improbable\n\n1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:29.360\n or very common.\n\n1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:31.800\n And Brandon Carter, like clearly articulated that\n\n1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:35.400\n in terms of anthropic arguments a few decades ago.\n\n1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:37.960\n So there is this kind of issue\n\n1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:39.800\n that we have to contend with dealing with life\n\n1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:41.880\n that's closer to home than we have to deal with\n\n1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:43.600\n with any other problems in physics,\n\n1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:45.800\n which we're talking about the physics of ourselves.\n\n1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:47.640\n And when you're asking about the origin of life event,\n\n1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:48.960\n that event happening in the universe,\n\n1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:52.520\n at least as like our existence is contingent on it.\n\n1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:55.800\n And so you can think about sort of fine tuning arguments\n\n1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:56.640\n that way too.\n\n1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:00.000\n So, but the sort of otter part of it is like,\n\n1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.200\n when I think about how likely it is,\n\n1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:06.320\n I think it's because we don't understand this mechanism yet\n\n1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:10.800\n about how information can be generated spontaneously\n\n1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:13.800\n that I like, cause I can't see that physics clearly yet,\n\n1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:15.720\n even though I have a lot of, you know,\n\n1:25:15.720 --> 1:25:18.680\n like some things around the space of it in my mind,\n\n1:25:18.680 --> 1:25:22.480\n I can't articulate how likely that process is.\n\n1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:24.200\n So my honest answer is, I don't know.\n\n1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:25.920\n And sometimes that feels like a cop out,\n\n1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:27.400\n but I feel like that's a more honest answer\n\n1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:29.800\n and a more meaningful way of making progress\n\n1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:32.760\n than what a lot of people wanna do, which is say,\n\n1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:34.760\n oh, well, we have a one in 10 chance of having\n\n1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:36.480\n on an exoplanet with Earth like properties\n\n1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:38.760\n because there's lots of Earth like planets out there\n\n1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:40.360\n and life happened fast on Earth.\n\n1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:42.960\n Well, so I have kind of a follow up question,\n\n1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:46.640\n but as a side comment, what I really am enjoying\n\n1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.800\n about the way you're talking about human beings\n\n1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:51.240\n is you always say, and not to make yourself conscious\n\n1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:53.080\n about it, cause I really, really enjoy it.\n\n1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:57.360\n You say we, you don't say humans.\n\n1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:00.200\n You say, cause oftentimes like, you know,\n\n1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:01.760\n I don't know, evolutionary biologists\n\n1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:05.400\n will kind of put yourself out as an observer,\n\n1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:09.040\n but it's kind of fascinating to think that you as a human\n\n1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:11.080\n are struggling about your own origins.\n\n1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:12.720\n Yes, that's the problem.\n\n1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.160\n And yeah, and I think, I don't do that deliberately,\n\n1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.440\n but I do think that way.\n\n1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:19.760\n And this is sort of the inversion\n\n1:26:19.760 --> 1:26:21.600\n from the logic of physics because physics\n\n1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:24.280\n as it's always been constructed has treated us\n\n1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:26.360\n as external observers of the universe.\n\n1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:27.680\n And we are not part of the universe.\n\n1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:29.360\n And this is why the problem of life,\n\n1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:31.320\n I think demands completely new thinking\n\n1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:33.600\n because we have to think about ourselves\n\n1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:35.600\n as minds that exist in the universe\n\n1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:37.800\n and are at this particular moment in history\n\n1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:39.680\n and looking out at the things around us\n\n1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:42.720\n and trying to understand what we are inside the system,\n\n1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:43.840\n not outside the system.\n\n1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:46.800\n We don't have descriptions at a fundamental level\n\n1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.840\n that describe us as inside the system.\n\n1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:51.280\n And this was my problem with cellular automata also.\n\n1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:54.200\n You're always an external observer for a cellular automata.\n\n1:26:54.200 --> 1:26:55.280\n You're not in the system.\n\n1:26:55.280 --> 1:26:58.000\n What does the cellular automata look like from the inside?\n\n1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:00.880\n I think you just broke my brain with that question.\n\n1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:01.720\n Exactly.\n\n1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:02.560\n But that's the fundamental.\n\n1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:03.400\n I thought about that for a long time, but.\n\n1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:08.400\n I'm gonna, yeah, that's a really clean formulation\n\n1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:10.640\n of a very fundamental question,\n\n1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:13.640\n because you can only, to understand cellular automata,\n\n1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:15.040\n you have to be inside of it.\n\n1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:20.880\n But as a human, sort of a poetic, romantic question,\n\n1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.120\n does it make you sad?\n\n1:27:22.120 --> 1:27:27.120\n Does it make you hopeful whether we're alone or not?\n\n1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:31.040\n Like in the different possible versions of that,\n\n1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.040\n if we're the highest assembly object in the entire universe,\n\n1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:37.000\n does that give you?\n\n1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.120\n At this moment in time, maybe.\n\n1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:39.880\n At this moment in the causal.\n\n1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:41.880\n Cause we may, I assume we have a future.\n\n1:27:41.880 --> 1:27:43.520\n Well, we definitely have a future.\n\n1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.920\n The question is where that future decreases the assembly.\n\n1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:52.040\n Like it could be where at the peak, or we could be just.\n\n1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:55.800\n That would be inconsistent with the physics in my mind.\n\n1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.160\n But so I should give a caveat.\n\n1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:01.560\n I've given the caveat that I'm biased as a physicist,\n\n1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:03.560\n but I'm also biased as an eternal optimist.\n\n1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:06.560\n So pretty much all of my modes of operation\n\n1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:08.120\n for building theories about the world\n\n1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:10.160\n are not like an Occam's razor,\n\n1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.640\n what's the simplest explanation,\n\n1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:14.440\n but what's the most optimistic explanation.\n\n1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:16.240\n And part of the reason for that\n\n1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:20.720\n is if you really think explanations have causal power,\n\n1:28:20.720 --> 1:28:22.080\n in the sense that our,\n\n1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:23.720\n like the fact that we have theories about the world\n\n1:28:23.720 --> 1:28:24.960\n has enabled technologies\n\n1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:27.560\n and physically transform the world around us.\n\n1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.120\n I think I have to take seriously that\n\n1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:31.400\n as a part of the physics I wanna describe\n\n1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:35.880\n and try to build theories of reality\n\n1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:37.800\n that are optimistic about what's coming next\n\n1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:39.080\n because the theories are in part\n\n1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:40.560\n the causes of what comes next.\n\n1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:45.000\n So there could be a physics of hope\n\n1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.880\n or physics of optimism in there too.\n\n1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:48.000\n Yes.\n\n1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.800\n Is that seems like also,\n\n1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:53.920\n I mean, optimism does seem to be a kind of engine\n\n1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:56.200\n that results in innovation.\n\n1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:57.040\n Yes.\n\n1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:58.320\n So this is like,\n\n1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:02.040\n why the hell are we trying to come up with new stuff?\n\n1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:04.840\n Oh, so I made this point about thinking life\n\n1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:06.120\n is the physics of existence.\n\n1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:07.800\n And it's not just the physics of existence,\n\n1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:11.360\n it's the physics of more things existing.\n\n1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:12.800\n So I think one of these drives of like.\n\n1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:13.640\n Creativity.\n\n1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:16.320\n Yeah, creativity, like optimism.\n\n1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:18.640\n So if you like, people like entropy.\n\n1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:21.360\n I don't like entropy as it was formulated in the 1800s.\n\n1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:22.760\n I think it's an antiquated concept,\n\n1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:26.320\n but this idea of maximizing\n\n1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:28.880\n over the possible number of states that could exist.\n\n1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.080\n Imagine the universe is actually trying to maximize\n\n1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:33.360\n over the number of things that could physically exist.\n\n1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:34.680\n What would be the best way to do that?\n\n1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:35.520\n The best way to do that\n\n1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:37.760\n would be evolve intelligent technological things\n\n1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:39.320\n that could explore that space.\n\n1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:43.840\n So, okay, that's talking about alien life\n\n1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:45.080\n out there in the universe,\n\n1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:48.560\n but you've also earlier in the conversation mentioned\n\n1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:50.200\n the shadow biosphere.\n\n1:29:50.200 --> 1:29:55.200\n So is it possible that we have weird life here on earth\n\n1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:58.440\n that we're just not,\n\n1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:02.200\n like even in a high assembly formulation of life,\n\n1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:05.680\n that we're just not paying attention to?\n\n1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:07.040\n We're blind to.\n\n1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:09.480\n Like life we're potentially able to detect,\n\n1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:10.520\n but we're blind to.\n\n1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:12.320\n And maybe you could say, what is the shadow biosphere?\n\n1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:13.320\n Sure, sure.\n\n1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:15.160\n Yeah, the shadow biosphere is this idea\n\n1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:17.960\n that there might've been other original life events\n\n1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:21.000\n that happened on earth that were independent\n\n1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:24.040\n from the original life event that led to us\n\n1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:26.360\n and all of the life that we know on earth.\n\n1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:29.360\n And therefore there could be aliens\n\n1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:32.120\n in the sense they have a different origin event.\n\n1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:33.280\n Living among us.\n\n1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:37.120\n And it was proposed by a number of people,\n\n1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.920\n but one of them was Paul Davies\n\n1:30:39.920 --> 1:30:41.160\n that I mentioned earlier is my mentor.\n\n1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:42.960\n And he has a really cute way of saying\n\n1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.760\n that aliens could be right under our noses\n\n1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:46.080\n or even in our noses.\n\n1:30:48.680 --> 1:30:50.360\n With a British accent, it sounds better.\n\n1:30:50.360 --> 1:30:53.760\n But anyway, so the idea is like,\n\n1:30:53.760 --> 1:30:56.440\n it could literally be anywhere around us.\n\n1:30:56.440 --> 1:30:58.240\n And if you think actually about the discovery\n\n1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:00.240\n of like viruses and bacteria,\n\n1:31:00.240 --> 1:31:02.400\n for a long time they were kind of a shadow biosphere.\n\n1:31:02.400 --> 1:31:06.080\n It was life that was around us, but invisible.\n\n1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:09.800\n But this takes it a little bit further\n\n1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:12.000\n and saying that all of those examples,\n\n1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.960\n viruses, bacteria and everything that we've discovered so far\n\n1:31:14.960 --> 1:31:16.160\n has this common ancestry\n\n1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:18.520\n and the last universal common ancestor of life on earth.\n\n1:31:18.520 --> 1:31:20.440\n So maybe there was a different origin event\n\n1:31:20.440 --> 1:31:24.480\n and that life is weirder still and might be among us\n\n1:31:24.480 --> 1:31:25.600\n and we could find it.\n\n1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:28.520\n We don't have to go out and the stars look for aliens\n\n1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:29.840\n just here on earth.\n\n1:31:29.840 --> 1:31:32.920\n Do you think that's a serious possibility\n\n1:31:32.920 --> 1:31:35.200\n that we should explore with the tools of science?\n\n1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:36.880\n Like this should be a serious effort.\n\n1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:39.560\n I think yes and no.\n\n1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:44.280\n And I mean, yes, because I think it's a serious hypothesis\n\n1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:46.360\n and I think it's worth exploring.\n\n1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:48.880\n And it is certainly more economical\n\n1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:52.080\n to look for signs of alien life on earth\n\n1:31:52.080 --> 1:31:54.200\n than it is to go and build spacecraft\n\n1:31:54.200 --> 1:31:56.320\n and send robots to other planets.\n\n1:31:56.320 --> 1:31:58.360\n And that was one of the reasons it was proposed is,\n\n1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:01.120\n well, if we do find an example of another original life\n\n1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:03.240\n on earth, it's hugely informative\n\n1:32:03.240 --> 1:32:05.480\n because it means the origin of life is not a rare event.\n\n1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.040\n If it happened twice on the same planet,\n\n1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:09.560\n that means it's probably pretty probable\n\n1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:11.680\n given conditions are right.\n\n1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:14.160\n So it has huge potential scientific impact,\n\n1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:16.560\n not to mention the fact that you might have like biochemistry\n\n1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:18.400\n and stuff that's informative for like medicine\n\n1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:19.240\n and stuff like that.\n\n1:32:19.240 --> 1:32:23.320\n But I think the thing for me that's challenging about it\n\n1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:24.720\n and this really comes from my own work,\n\n1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:28.920\n like thinking about life as a planetary scale process\n\n1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:31.000\n and also trying to understand\n\n1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:33.120\n sometimes what I call like the statistical mechanics\n\n1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:35.680\n of biochemistry, but large scale statistical patterns\n\n1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:38.480\n in the chemistry that life uses on earth.\n\n1:32:38.480 --> 1:32:40.720\n There are a lot of regularities there\n\n1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:45.720\n and life does seem to have planetary scale organization\n\n1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:47.880\n that's consistent even with some of the patterns\n\n1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:49.240\n that we see at the individual scale.\n\n1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:51.920\n So if you think life is a planetary scale phenomenon\n\n1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:55.800\n and the chemistry of life has to be sort of not just,\n\n1:32:55.800 --> 1:32:58.080\n it's not, an individual is not necessarily\n\n1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:00.080\n the fundamental unit of life, right?\n\n1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:01.240\n The fundamental unit of life\n\n1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:05.280\n is these informational lineages and they're kind of,\n\n1:33:05.280 --> 1:33:08.320\n they intersect over spatial scales.\n\n1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:10.400\n So everything on earth is kind of related\n\n1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:12.520\n by the common causal history.\n\n1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.200\n So it's hard for me based on the way I think\n\n1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:18.040\n about the physics and also some of the stuff\n\n1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:19.960\n that my group has done to really think\n\n1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:23.000\n that there could be evidence\n\n1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.160\n or there could be a second sample of life on earth.\n\n1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:26.320\n But I think there are ways\n\n1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:28.560\n that we need to be more concrete about that.\n\n1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:31.200\n And I have thought a little bit about like,\n\n1:33:32.080 --> 1:33:33.480\n like you can represent the chemistry\n\n1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:35.680\n in an individual cell as a network.\n\n1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:39.360\n And then those networks, something my group has shown\n\n1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.520\n actually scale with the same property.\n\n1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:43.920\n So ecosystems have the same properties\n\n1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:46.080\n as individuals as planetary scale.\n\n1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.120\n And then you could imagine\n\n1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:49.600\n if you had alien chemistry intermixed in there,\n\n1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:50.960\n that scaling would be broken.\n\n1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.800\n So if there's some robustness property\n\n1:33:52.800 --> 1:33:54.560\n or something associated to it,\n\n1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:56.040\n and you get alien chemistry in there,\n\n1:33:56.040 --> 1:33:57.120\n it just breaks everything.\n\n1:33:57.120 --> 1:34:00.720\n And you don't have a planetary ecosystem functioning\n\n1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:04.600\n and individuals functioning across all these scales.\n\n1:34:04.600 --> 1:34:06.160\n So I guess what I'm arguing\n\n1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:08.400\n is life is not a scale dependent phenomenon.\n\n1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:10.240\n It's not just cellular life.\n\n1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:11.520\n So if you have a shadow biosphere,\n\n1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:13.560\n it has to be integrated with all of these other scales.\n\n1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:16.160\n And that would lose the meaning\n\n1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:17.480\n of the word shadow biosphere, I guess.\n\n1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:18.520\n I think so, yeah.\n\n1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:21.280\n So it's an open question, right?\n\n1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:23.160\n And I think it would tell us a lot.\n\n1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:25.560\n So there has been very minimal effort\n\n1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:28.160\n of people to look for a shadow biosphere.\n\n1:34:28.160 --> 1:34:29.200\n But then the question,\n\n1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.440\n it could be possible that there's like\n\n1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:37.160\n sufficiently distinct planets within one planet,\n\n1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:40.000\n meaning like environments within one planet.\n\n1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:41.320\n Like, I don't know.\n\n1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:44.200\n I've been looking recently\n\n1:34:45.160 --> 1:34:47.600\n because of having a chat with Catherine Duclair\n\n1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:49.240\n about Io, the moon of Jupiter,\n\n1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:51.600\n that's like all volcanoes and volcanoes are bad ass.\n\n1:34:51.600 --> 1:34:56.600\n But like, imagining life inside volcanoes, right?\n\n1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:03.000\n It seems like sufficiently chemically different\n\n1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.440\n like to be living in the darkness\n\n1:35:05.440 --> 1:35:06.640\n where there's a lot of heat\n\n1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:10.960\n and maybe you could have different Earths on a planet.\n\n1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:12.680\n Or like if you go deep enough in the crust,\n\n1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:14.360\n maybe there's like a layer where there's no life.\n\n1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:15.840\n And then there's suddenly life again.\n\n1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:18.880\n And maybe those, you know, lizard men\n\n1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:20.760\n or whatever they are that people dream about\n\n1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.640\n are really down there.\n\n1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.120\n I know that's a little flippant,\n\n1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:26.760\n but really like there could be like chemical cycles\n\n1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:29.000\n deep in the Earth's crust that might be alive\n\n1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:30.240\n and are completely distinct\n\n1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:33.400\n in chemical origin to surface life.\n\n1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.400\n Right, that they wouldn't be interacting with each other.\n\n1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:36.600\n Yeah, and that's one of the proposals\n\n1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:38.080\n for the shadow biosphere is like,\n\n1:35:38.080 --> 1:35:40.840\n sometimes people talk about it as being geologically\n\n1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:43.640\n or geographically distinct that it might be,\n\n1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:45.160\n you know, you have no life for this region\n\n1:35:45.160 --> 1:35:46.680\n and then a different example.\n\n1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:47.880\n And then sometimes people talk about it\n\n1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:49.280\n being chemically distinct,\n\n1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:51.560\n that the chemistry is sufficiently different,\n\n1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:52.880\n that it's completely orthogonal\n\n1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.400\n or non interacting with our chemistry.\n\n1:35:54.400 --> 1:35:55.920\n It seems to me at least the chemistry\n\n1:35:55.920 --> 1:36:00.920\n is a more powerful boundary than geographic.\n\n1:36:02.440 --> 1:36:06.320\n It just seems like life finds a way literally to travel.\n\n1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:08.200\n Yeah, it does.\n\n1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:11.440\n What do you think about all these UFO sightings?\n\n1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:14.000\n So to me, it's really inspiring.\n\n1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.120\n It's yet another localized way to dream\n\n1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:21.560\n about the mysterious that is out there.\n\n1:36:21.560 --> 1:36:24.560\n Yeah, so I've actually been more intrigued\n\n1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:26.480\n by the cultural phenomena UFOs\n\n1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:28.360\n than the phenomena UFOs themselves,\n\n1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.760\n because I think it's intriguing about how\n\n1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.400\n we are preparing ourselves mentally\n\n1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:37.520\n for understanding others\n\n1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:39.640\n and how we have thought about that historically\n\n1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:44.280\n and what the sort of modern incarnations of that are.\n\n1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:47.440\n It's more like, I want an explanation for us.\n\n1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:48.640\n That's my motivation.\n\n1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.440\n And having some, you know,\n\n1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:52.120\n streaks across the sky or something\n\n1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:53.120\n and saying that's aliens,\n\n1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:55.720\n it doesn't tell you anything.\n\n1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:57.520\n So unless you have a deeper explanation\n\n1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.400\n and you have, you know, more lines of,\n\n1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:02.680\n you know, where is this gonna take us in the future?\n\n1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:04.720\n It's just not as interesting to me\n\n1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:06.760\n as the problem of understanding life itself\n\n1:37:06.760 --> 1:37:08.720\n and aliens as a more general phenomenon.\n\n1:37:08.720 --> 1:37:11.000\n I do think it's, just as you said,\n\n1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.920\n a good way to psychologically and sociologically\n\n1:37:13.920 --> 1:37:15.840\n prepare ourselves to sort of like,\n\n1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:17.440\n what would that look like?\n\n1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:18.680\n And very importantly,\n\n1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:21.440\n which is what a lot of people talk about politically,\n\n1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:24.480\n sort of there's this idea from the,\n\n1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:27.640\n so I came from the Soviet Union of like the Cold War\n\n1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:30.080\n and we have to hide secrets.\n\n1:37:30.080 --> 1:37:33.440\n There's some way in us searching for life on other planets\n\n1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:36.000\n or our searching for life in general,\n\n1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:40.840\n the way we've done government in the past,\n\n1:37:40.840 --> 1:37:43.280\n we tend to think of all new things\n\n1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:45.160\n as potential military secrets,\n\n1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:46.880\n so we want to hide them.\n\n1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:49.240\n And one of the ways that people kind of look\n\n1:37:49.240 --> 1:37:51.680\n at UFO sightings is like,\n\n1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:53.520\n like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff.\n\n1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:55.080\n Like what is the government hiding?\n\n1:37:55.080 --> 1:37:57.920\n I think that's a really, you know,\n\n1:37:57.920 --> 1:38:00.120\n in one sense it's a conspiratorial question,\n\n1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.400\n but I think in another,\n\n1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:07.320\n it's an inspiration to change the way we do government\n\n1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:09.960\n to where secrets don't,\n\n1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:12.440\n maybe there are times when you want to keep secrets\n\n1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:13.440\n as military secrets,\n\n1:38:13.440 --> 1:38:15.920\n but maybe we need to release a lot more stuff\n\n1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:19.040\n and see us as a human species as together\n\n1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:20.160\n in this whole search.\n\n1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:21.720\n Yeah, the public engagement part there\n\n1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:23.840\n is really interesting.\n\n1:38:23.840 --> 1:38:25.680\n And it's almost like a challenge\n\n1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:27.920\n to the way we've done stuff in the past\n\n1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:30.320\n in terms of keeping secrets when they're not,\n\n1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:33.280\n so like the first step,\n\n1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:36.560\n if you don't know how something works,\n\n1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:38.440\n if there's a mysterious thing,\n\n1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:42.080\n the first instinct should not be like, let's hide it.\n\n1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:44.040\n Let's put it in the closet.\n\n1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:46.000\n So that the Chinese or the Russian government\n\n1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.840\n or whatever government doesn't find it.\n\n1:38:48.840 --> 1:38:53.080\n Maybe the first instinct should be, let's understand it.\n\n1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:54.720\n Perhaps let's understand it together.\n\n1:38:54.720 --> 1:38:55.760\n Right.\n\n1:38:55.760 --> 1:38:57.000\n No, I think that's good.\n\n1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:58.720\n And something I realized recently\n\n1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:00.120\n that I never thought was gonna be a problem,\n\n1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:02.640\n but I think this actually helps with quite a bit\n\n1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:05.800\n is because so many people nowadays\n\n1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:08.160\n believe we've already made contact,\n\n1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:10.840\n that as an astrobiologist,\n\n1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:14.600\n if we actually want to understand life and make contact,\n\n1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:17.360\n we kind of have to deconstruct the narratives\n\n1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:18.600\n we've already built from ourselves\n\n1:39:18.600 --> 1:39:19.920\n and kind of unteach ourselves\n\n1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:22.640\n that we've learned about aliens and then reteach ourselves.\n\n1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:26.040\n So there's this really interesting sort of dialogue there\n\n1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:27.840\n and making it open to the public\n\n1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:29.560\n that they actually have to think critically about it\n\n1:39:29.560 --> 1:39:30.960\n and they see the evidence for themselves,\n\n1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:33.800\n I think is really important for that process.\n\n1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:38.200\n Yeah, that aliens might be way weirder than we can imagine.\n\n1:39:38.200 --> 1:39:39.320\n Yes.\n\n1:39:39.320 --> 1:39:41.920\n Yes, I'm pretty sure they're probably weirder\n\n1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:42.920\n than we can imagine.\n\n1:39:44.120 --> 1:39:49.120\n Okay, we've in 2020 and still living through a pandemic,\n\n1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:54.120\n setting the political and all those kinds of things aside,\n\n1:39:54.120 --> 1:39:58.200\n I've always found viruses fascinating\n\n1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:03.200\n as dynamical systems, I was gonna say living systems,\n\n1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:07.160\n but I've always kind of thought of them as living,\n\n1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:09.560\n but that's a whole nother kind of discussion.\n\n1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:13.280\n Maybe it'd be great to put that on the table.\n\n1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:17.520\n One, do you find viruses beautiful slash terrifying?\n\n1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:21.560\n And two, do you think they're living things\n\n1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:25.800\n or there's some aspect to them per our discussion of life\n\n1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:27.760\n that makes them living?\n\n1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:30.120\n I mean, living in a pandemic saying viruses are beautiful\n\n1:40:30.120 --> 1:40:30.960\n is probably a hard thing,\n\n1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:34.520\n but I do find them beautiful to a degree.\n\n1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.520\n I think even in the sense of mediating a global pandemic,\n\n1:40:39.760 --> 1:40:41.440\n there's something like deeply intriguing there\n\n1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:46.200\n because these are tiny, tiny little things, right?\n\n1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:51.200\n And yet they can essentially cause a seizure\n\n1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:55.840\n or handicap an entire civilization at a global scale.\n\n1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:58.520\n So just that intersection between\n\n1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:02.640\n our perceived invincibility and our susceptibility to things\n\n1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:04.840\n and also the interaction across scales of those things\n\n1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:09.280\n is just a really amazing feature of our world.\n\n1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:12.680\n Most technology, whether it's viruses or AI\n\n1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:16.440\n that can scale in an exponential way,\n\n1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:21.360\n like kind of run as opposed to like,\n\n1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:24.800\n one thing makes another thing makes another thing,\n\n1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:26.520\n it's one thing makes two things\n\n1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:28.720\n and those two things make four things.\n\n1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:30.960\n Like that kind of process\n\n1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:34.800\n also seems to be fundamental to life.\n\n1:41:34.800 --> 1:41:35.640\n Yes.\n\n1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:40.000\n And it's terrifying because in a matter of,\n\n1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:43.360\n in a very short time scale, it can,\n\n1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:48.760\n if it's good at being life, whatever that is,\n\n1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:52.520\n it can quickly overtake the other competing forms of life.\n\n1:41:52.520 --> 1:41:53.520\n Right.\n\n1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:57.680\n And that's scary both for AI and for viruses.\n\n1:41:57.680 --> 1:42:00.560\n And it seems like understanding these processes\n\n1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.000\n that are underlying viruses.\n\n1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.240\n And I don't mean like on the virology or biology side,\n\n1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:09.800\n but on some kind of more computational physics perspective\n\n1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:11.320\n as we've been talking about,\n\n1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:15.680\n seems to be really important to figure out\n\n1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:19.120\n how humans can survive.\n\n1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:20.520\n Right.\n\n1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:23.960\n Along with this kind of life\n\n1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:26.840\n and perhaps becoming a multi planetary species\n\n1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:28.680\n is a part of that.\n\n1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:31.640\n Like there's no, maybe like we'll figure out\n\n1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.280\n from a physics perspective is like,\n\n1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:38.040\n there's no way any living system\n\n1:42:38.040 --> 1:42:40.760\n can be stable for prolonged period of time\n\n1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:43.680\n and survive unless it expands exponentially throughout.\n\n1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:46.200\n Like we have to multiply.\n\n1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:49.880\n Otherwise anything that doesn't multiply exponentially\n\n1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:50.840\n will die eventually.\n\n1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:52.440\n Maybe that's a fundamental law.\n\n1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:56.000\n Maybe, I don't know.\n\n1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.920\n I always get really bothered by these Darwinian narratives\n\n1:42:58.920 --> 1:43:01.720\n that are like the fittest replicator wins and things.\n\n1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:03.120\n And I don't, I just don't feel like\n\n1:43:03.120 --> 1:43:04.720\n that's exactly what's going on.\n\n1:43:04.720 --> 1:43:06.440\n I think like the copying of information\n\n1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.440\n is sort of ancillary to this other process of creativity.\n\n1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:12.360\n Right, so like the drive is actually,\n\n1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:13.720\n the drive is creativity,\n\n1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:16.000\n but if you wanna keep the creativity\n\n1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:17.480\n that's existed in the past,\n\n1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:19.600\n it has to be copied into the future.\n\n1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:23.240\n So replication, like if you, so that for me is,\n\n1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:26.280\n so I had this set of arguments with Michael Lockman\n\n1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:29.520\n and Lee Cronin about the like life being about persistence.\n\n1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:30.720\n They thought it was about persistence\n\n1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:32.320\n and like survival of the fittest kind of thing.\n\n1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:33.840\n And I'm like, no, it's about existence.\n\n1:43:33.840 --> 1:43:36.680\n It's like, cause when you're talking about that,\n\n1:43:36.680 --> 1:43:38.640\n it's easy to say that in retrospect,\n\n1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:40.800\n you can post select on the things that survived\n\n1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:43.000\n and then say why they survived,\n\n1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:46.280\n but you can't do that going forward.\n\n1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:47.960\n That's really profound\n\n1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:52.160\n that survival is just a nice little side effect feature\n\n1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:56.560\n of maximizing creativity, but it doesn't need to be there.\n\n1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:58.520\n Yeah, I like that. That's really beautiful.\n\n1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:01.800\n Yeah, I know, like I said, I like optimistic theories.\n\n1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:03.120\n Well, I don't know if that's optimistic.\n\n1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:06.120\n That could be terrifying to people because,\n\n1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:09.360\n because a system that maximizes creativity\n\n1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:13.040\n may very quickly get rid of humans for some reason,\n\n1:44:13.040 --> 1:44:15.920\n if it comes up with some other creative,\n\n1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:20.000\n I mean, forms of existence, right?\n\n1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.240\n This is the AI thing is like the moment you have an AI system\n\n1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:28.960\n that can flourish in the space of ideas\n\n1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:33.360\n or in some other space much more effectively than humans.\n\n1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.600\n And it's sufficiently integrated into the physical space\n\n1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.160\n to be able to modify the environment.\n\n1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:40.280\n I think we'll just be like\n\n1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:42.040\n the core genetic architecture or something.\n\n1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:44.400\n We'll be like the DNA for AI, right?\n\n1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:46.440\n It's like, we haven't lost the past informational\n\n1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:47.720\n architectures on this planet.\n\n1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:48.760\n They're still there.\n\n1:44:49.840 --> 1:44:53.840\n Yeah, so the AI will use our brains in some part\n\n1:44:53.840 --> 1:44:58.000\n to like ride, like accelerate the exchange of ideas.\n\n1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.960\n That's the neural language dream is that,\n\n1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:03.480\n well, the humans will be still around\n\n1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:05.320\n because you're saying architecture.\n\n1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:06.400\n Yeah, but I don't even think\n\n1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:08.320\n they necessarily need to tap into our brains.\n\n1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:10.400\n I mean, just collectively, we do interesting things.\n\n1:45:10.400 --> 1:45:12.160\n What if they were just using like the patterns\n\n1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:14.720\n in our communication or something?\n\n1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:18.080\n Oh, without controlling it, just observing?\n\n1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:19.000\n Well, I don't know.\n\n1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.720\n In what sense do you control the chemistry\n\n1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:21.880\n happening in your body?\n\n1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:25.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:25.200 --> 1:45:27.320\n I mean, obviously I don't know.\n\n1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:31.280\n I'm just, like the way I look at, like people look at AI\n\n1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:33.480\n and then they look at this thing that's bigger than us\n\n1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:36.040\n and is coming in the future and is smarter than us.\n\n1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:38.640\n And I think though that looking at the past history\n\n1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.600\n of life on the planet and what information\n\n1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:42.240\n has been doing for the last 4 billion years\n\n1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:44.840\n is probably very informative to asking questions\n\n1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:46.160\n about what's coming next.\n\n1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:49.120\n And I don't,\n\n1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:53.360\n one is planetary scale transitions are really important\n\n1:45:53.360 --> 1:45:54.320\n for new phases.\n\n1:45:54.320 --> 1:45:56.600\n So the global internet and sort of global integration\n\n1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:58.440\n of our technology, I think is an important thing.\n\n1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:01.040\n So that's again, life is a planetary scale phenomenon\n\n1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:03.280\n but we're an integrated component of that phenomenon.\n\n1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:04.920\n I don't really see that the technology\n\n1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:07.040\n is gonna replace us in that way.\n\n1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:09.800\n It's just gonna keep scaffolding and building.\n\n1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.320\n And I also don't have an idea\n\n1:46:11.320 --> 1:46:12.680\n that we're gonna build AI in a box.\n\n1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:14.440\n I think AI is gonna emerge.\n\n1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:17.120\n AGI to me is a planetary scale phenomena\n\n1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:19.880\n that's gonna emerge from our technology.\n\n1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:22.240\n Planetary scale phenomena.\n\n1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:26.120\n But do you think an AGI is not distinct from humans?\n\n1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:27.440\n The whole package.\n\n1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:28.280\n The whole package, yeah.\n\n1:46:28.280 --> 1:46:30.080\n Comes as a planetary scale phenomena.\n\n1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:31.640\n And that goes back to the fact that like,\n\n1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:34.840\n you were asking questions about you as an individual.\n\n1:46:34.840 --> 1:46:36.120\n Like, what are you as an individual?\n\n1:46:36.120 --> 1:46:38.040\n You're like a packet of information\n\n1:46:38.040 --> 1:46:41.320\n that exists in the particular physical thing that is you.\n\n1:46:41.320 --> 1:46:43.680\n We're all just packets of information.\n\n1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.600\n And some of us are aggregates in certain ways\n\n1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.080\n but it's all just kind of exchanging\n\n1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:48.200\n and propagating, right?\n\n1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:49.600\n And processing.\n\n1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:52.600\n Is your packet of information\n\n1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:56.000\n that you've continually referred to as Sarah\n\n1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:01.000\n afraid of the dissipation of the death of that packet?\n\n1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:03.000\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:04.640\n Do you ponder death?\n\n1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:07.240\n Does death have meaning in this process\n\n1:47:07.240 --> 1:47:09.240\n of creativity?\n\n1:47:09.240 --> 1:47:12.280\n I think I have the natural biological urge\n\n1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:13.880\n that everyone has to fear death.\n\n1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:17.760\n I think the thing that I think is interesting\n\n1:47:17.760 --> 1:47:20.160\n is if I think about it rationally,\n\n1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:22.040\n I'm not necessarily afraid of death for me\n\n1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:25.240\n because I won't be aware of being dead.\n\n1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:26.680\n But I am afraid like for my kids\n\n1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:28.760\n because it matters to them if I die.\n\n1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:33.680\n So again, like I think death becomes more significant\n\n1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:37.280\n as a collective property, not as an individual one.\n\n1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:39.240\n Yeah, but isn't there something to fear\n\n1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:41.640\n about the fact that the way,\n\n1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:45.560\n like the creative,\n\n1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:48.520\n the complexity of information\n\n1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:51.040\n that's been like created in you.\n\n1:47:51.040 --> 1:47:52.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:57.040\n The fact that it kind of breaks apart and disappears.\n\n1:47:57.640 --> 1:47:59.560\n It doesn't, but I don't think it disappears.\n\n1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:00.960\n It's just not me anymore.\n\n1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:05.960\n Right, but that process of it being not you anymore,\n\n1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:07.960\n that doesn't scare you?\n\n1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:08.960\n Of course it does.\n\n1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:09.800\n The mystery of it.\n\n1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:10.640\n I mean, the...\n\n1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:12.320\n Yeah, but I guess I'm heartened by the fact\n\n1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:14.000\n that there will be some imprints of the fact\n\n1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.960\n that I existed still in the universe after I leave it.\n\n1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:18.360\n Yeah, but there'll be a...\n\n1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:19.200\n Okay, but...\n\n1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:21.720\n And also that has to do with my perception of time, right?\n\n1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:23.760\n So, I perceive time as flowing,\n\n1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:25.280\n but that might not be the case.\n\n1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:29.960\n I mean, this is standard physicist comfort is,\n\n1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:33.560\n every moment exists and there's no...\n\n1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:38.560\n And the flow of time is just our perception of us changing.\n\n1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:43.400\n So, you can travel back in time and that's comforting?\n\n1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:44.800\n Like from a physicist's concept?\n\n1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:45.640\n No, no, no.\n\n1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.800\n I'm not talking about traveling back in time.\n\n1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:49.400\n I'm just saying that the moments in the past still exist.\n\n1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:52.640\n Now, whether the moments in the future exist or not\n\n1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:53.800\n is a different question.\n\n1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:57.040\n That's not comforting to me in terms of death.\n\n1:48:57.040 --> 1:48:58.960\n The flow of time is not...\n\n1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:03.960\n I think there's no comfort in the face of death\n\n1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:07.880\n for what we are because we like existing.\n\n1:49:07.880 --> 1:49:11.560\n And I think it's especially true if you love life\n\n1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:13.680\n and you love what life is.\n\n1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:16.160\n Do you think there's a certain sense in which\n\n1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:19.120\n the fear of death or the fear of nonexistence,\n\n1:49:19.120 --> 1:49:21.360\n maybe fear is not the right word,\n\n1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:26.360\n is the actual very phenomena that gives birth to existence?\n\n1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:28.480\n Like, death is fundamental.\n\n1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:31.560\n It just feels like freaking out, oh shit,\n\n1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:36.560\n this ride ends is actually like the...\n\n1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:40.760\n That's the thing that gives birth to this whole thing.\n\n1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:41.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:45.080\n That like, it's constantly...\n\n1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:48.120\n It's matter constantly freaking out about the fact\n\n1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:48.960\n that it's gonna be the most.\n\n1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:51.080\n No, I think things like to exist.\n\n1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:51.920\n I think they wanna exist.\n\n1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.240\n Yeah, there's a desire, whatever, to exist.\n\n1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:56.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:56.080 --> 1:49:57.960\n There's a drive to exist\n\n1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:00.000\n and there's a drive for more things to exist.\n\n1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000\n I guess, yeah, I like existing.\n\n1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:07.560\n I like it a lot and I don't know it any other way.\n\n1:50:09.280 --> 1:50:11.960\n See, I don't even know if I like existing.\n\n1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:14.520\n I think I really don't like not existing.\n\n1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:15.360\n Yes.\n\n1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:16.200\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:19.760\n Yeah, maybe it's that.\n\n1:50:19.760 --> 1:50:23.320\n Some days I might like existing less than others.\n\n1:50:23.320 --> 1:50:27.600\n Yes, but like, I think those are like surface feelings.\n\n1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:28.440\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:29.880\n It seems like there's something fundamental\n\n1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:31.240\n about wanting to exist.\n\n1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:32.080\n No, I think that's right.\n\n1:50:32.080 --> 1:50:35.720\n But I think to your point that that might go back\n\n1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.120\n to the more fundamental idea that, you know,\n\n1:50:39.120 --> 1:50:40.640\n if life is the physics of existence\n\n1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:43.040\n and maximizing existence, individual organisms,\n\n1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:45.520\n of course, wanna maximize their existence\n\n1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:48.000\n and everything, you know, like wants to exist.\n\n1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.560\n But I guess for me, the small comfort is\n\n1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:54.480\n my existence matters to future existence.\n\n1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:57.320\n Speaking of future existence, is there advice\n\n1:50:57.320 --> 1:51:00.880\n you can give to future pockets of existences,\n\n1:51:00.880 --> 1:51:04.160\n AKA young people, about life?\n\n1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:07.240\n You've had, you've worn many hats.\n\n1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.120\n You've taken on some of the biggest problems\n\n1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:10.400\n in the universe.\n\n1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:13.000\n Is there advice you can give to young people\n\n1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:17.280\n about life, about career, about existing?\n\n1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:20.520\n Yeah, maybe not about the last one.\n\n1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:23.400\n You know, a lot of people ask me this question\n\n1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:25.880\n about like working on such hard problems,\n\n1:51:25.880 --> 1:51:28.160\n like how can you make a successful career out of that?\n\n1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:31.280\n But I think for me, it couldn't be otherwise.\n\n1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:33.280\n Like I have to, to be fulfilled,\n\n1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:35.240\n you have to work on things you care about.\n\n1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:36.840\n And that's always kind of driven me.\n\n1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:39.800\n And that's been discipline, department,\n\n1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:44.880\n and sort of superficial level problem independent\n\n1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:48.360\n because I started at community college actually,\n\n1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:49.680\n and I was taking a physics class\n\n1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:53.080\n and I learned about magnetic monopoles\n\n1:51:53.080 --> 1:51:55.440\n and we didn't know if they existed in the universe,\n\n1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:57.880\n but we could predict them and we could go look for them.\n\n1:51:57.880 --> 1:51:59.520\n And I was so deeply intrigued by this idea\n\n1:51:59.520 --> 1:52:02.440\n that we had this mathematical formula to go look for things.\n\n1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:05.120\n And then I wanted to become a theoretical physicist\n\n1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:05.960\n because of that.\n\n1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:07.680\n But that actually wasn't my driving question.\n\n1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.600\n I realized my driving question is the nature\n\n1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:12.120\n of the correspondence between our minds\n\n1:52:12.120 --> 1:52:14.360\n and physical reality and what we are.\n\n1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:16.480\n And that question is very deep,\n\n1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:18.560\n so you can work across a lot of fields doing that.\n\n1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:20.040\n But I think without that driving question,\n\n1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:22.280\n I never would have been able to do all the things\n\n1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:23.120\n that I've done.\n\n1:52:23.120 --> 1:52:25.080\n It's really the passion that drives it.\n\n1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:28.480\n And usually when students ask me these kinds of questions,\n\n1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:31.800\n I tell them like, you have to find something\n\n1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:33.240\n you really care about working on\n\n1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:35.440\n because if you don't really care about it,\n\n1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:37.880\n A, you're not gonna be your best at it,\n\n1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:39.800\n and B, it's not gonna be worth your time.\n\n1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:41.520\n Why would you spend your time working on something\n\n1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:43.040\n you're not interested in?\n\n1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:44.760\n So find the driving questions.\n\n1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:46.000\n Yeah, find the driving question.\n\n1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.480\n Find your passion.\n\n1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:49.440\n I mean, I think passion makes a huge difference\n\n1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:52.720\n in terms of creativity, talent, and potential,\n\n1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:55.040\n and also being able to tolerate all the hard things\n\n1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:57.880\n that come with any career or life.\n\n1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.840\n Yeah, I've had a bunch of moments in my life\n\n1:52:59.840 --> 1:53:01.800\n where I've just been captivated\n\n1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:03.200\n by some beautiful phenomena.\n\n1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:06.080\n And I guess being rigorous about it\n\n1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:09.520\n and asking what is the question underlying this phenomena,\n\n1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:13.400\n like robots bring a smile to my face\n\n1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:17.040\n and forming a question of like,\n\n1:53:17.040 --> 1:53:19.960\n why the hell is this so fascinating?\n\n1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:23.200\n Why is this, specifically the human robot\n\n1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:27.040\n interaction question that something beautiful\n\n1:53:27.040 --> 1:53:30.720\n is brought to life when humans and robots interact,\n\n1:53:30.720 --> 1:53:32.560\n understanding that deeply.\n\n1:53:33.640 --> 1:53:36.640\n It's like, okay, so this is gonna be my life work then.\n\n1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:37.760\n I don't know what the hell it is,\n\n1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:39.640\n but that's what I wanna do.\n\n1:53:39.640 --> 1:53:40.480\n Interesting.\n\n1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:43.000\n And doing that for whatever the hell gives you\n\n1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.320\n that kind of feeling, I guess, is the point.\n\n1:53:45.320 --> 1:53:46.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:47.880\n Am I allowed to ask you a question?\n\n1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:48.720\n Sure.\n\n1:53:48.720 --> 1:53:49.800\n Okay.\n\n1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:50.920\n On that point,\n\n1:53:50.920 --> 1:53:53.880\n because I had this colleague that suggested the idea\n\n1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:56.160\n that consciousness might be contagious.\n\n1:53:56.160 --> 1:53:58.240\n And so interacting with things,\n\n1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:01.000\n it's an interesting idea, right?\n\n1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:04.440\n So I'm wondering sort of the motivation there.\n\n1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:08.560\n Is it the motivation that you want more of the universe\n\n1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:11.280\n to appreciate things the way we do\n\n1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:12.760\n and appreciate those interactions?\n\n1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:15.760\n Or is it really more the enjoyment of the human\n\n1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:16.600\n in those interactions?\n\n1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:20.320\n Like, is it, do you know what I'm asking?\n\n1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:21.160\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:23.800\n See, I think consciousness is created\n\n1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:27.520\n in the interaction between things.\n\n1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:28.360\n Yes, I agree.\n\n1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:31.160\n So the joy is in the creation of consciousness.\n\n1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:32.000\n I see.\n\n1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.120\n I really like the idea that\n\n1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:38.560\n it doesn't just have to be two humans\n\n1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:40.080\n creating consciousness together.\n\n1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:43.400\n It could be humans and other entities.\n\n1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:46.520\n We talked offline about dogs and other pets and so on.\n\n1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:49.720\n There's a magic, I mean, I've been calling it love.\n\n1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:54.320\n It's this beauty of the human experience that's created.\n\n1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:58.200\n And it just feels like fascinating that you could do that\n\n1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:00.560\n with a robotic system.\n\n1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:01.400\n Right.\n\n1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:06.400\n And there's something really powerful, at least to me,\n\n1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:10.400\n about engineering systems that allow you\n\n1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:12.560\n to create some of the magic of the human experience.\n\n1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:15.440\n Cause then you get to understand what it takes,\n\n1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:17.920\n at least get inklings of what it takes\n\n1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.360\n to create consciousness.\n\n1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:24.280\n And I don't get this, you know,\n\n1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:26.240\n philosophers get really upset about this idea\n\n1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:29.640\n that sort of the illusion of consciousness is consciousness.\n\n1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:33.680\n But I really liked the idea of engineering systems\n\n1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:37.240\n that fool you into thinking they're conscious.\n\n1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:38.080\n Right.\n\n1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:41.880\n Because that's sufficient to create the magical experience.\n\n1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:43.520\n Right, because it's the interaction, yeah.\n\n1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:44.520\n It's the interaction, yeah.\n\n1:55:44.520 --> 1:55:45.360\n Right.\n\n1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:47.600\n And this is the Russian hat I wear,\n\n1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:51.000\n which is like, I think there's an ocean of loneliness\n\n1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:51.920\n in the world.\n\n1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:53.440\n I think we're deeply lonely.\n\n1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:57.200\n We're not even allowing ourselves to acknowledge that.\n\n1:55:57.200 --> 1:56:00.800\n And I kind of think that's what love is between romantic love\n\n1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:05.800\n and friendship is two people kind of getting a little bit\n\n1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:10.800\n like alleviating for brief moment.\n\n1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:12.240\n That loneliness.\n\n1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:15.280\n That loneliness, but not, but we're not there.\n\n1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:17.920\n It's not the full aspect of that loneliness.\n\n1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:19.360\n Like we're desperately alone.\n\n1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:22.560\n We're desperately afraid of nonexisting.\n\n1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:23.400\n Right.\n\n1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:24.560\n I have that kind of sense.\n\n1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:28.160\n And I just want to explore that ocean of loneliness more.\n\n1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:29.000\n Right.\n\n1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:30.840\n When engineering, like create a submarine\n\n1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:33.720\n that goes into the depth of that loneliness.\n\n1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:36.560\n So creating systems that can truly hear you.\n\n1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:37.400\n Right.\n\n1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:38.240\n And truly listen.\n\n1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:39.800\n Make the universe a less lonely place.\n\n1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:40.960\n Exactly.\n\n1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:43.160\n Let me ask you about the meaning.\n\n1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:44.800\n You've brought up why.\n\n1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:45.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:46.480\n The physics of why.\n\n1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:51.120\n What do you think is the meaning of our particular planets,\n\n1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.600\n set of existences and the universe in general?\n\n1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.040\n The meaning of life.\n\n1:56:57.040 --> 1:56:57.880\n Yes.\n\n1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:59.040\n Someone once told me as a physicist,\n\n1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:00.800\n I'm not allowed to ask why questions,\n\n1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:01.960\n but I don't believe that.\n\n1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:06.960\n So I think what we are is the creative process\n\n1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:11.400\n in the universe, I think.\n\n1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:13.160\n And for me, that's the meaning.\n\n1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:18.160\n The ability to create more possibilities\n\n1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:19.480\n and more things to exist.\n\n1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:23.760\n What is, Dostoevsky has the saying,\n\n1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:25.760\n beauty will save the world.\n\n1:57:25.760 --> 1:57:30.760\n What is, is there a connection between creation and beauty?\n\n1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:34.120\n I think so.\n\n1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:39.320\n So is that like, is beauty a correlate of creation?\n\n1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:40.160\n It might be.\n\n1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:41.160\n I don't know.\n\n1:57:41.160 --> 1:57:43.280\n I mean, why is it, you know,\n\n1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:44.720\n a lot of people have asked these kinds of questions,\n\n1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:47.200\n but like, why is it we have such an emotional response\n\n1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:49.800\n to intellectual activity or creativity?\n\n1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:52.440\n And that seems kind of a deep question to me.\n\n1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:55.560\n Like, it seems very intrinsic to what we are.\n\n1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:59.840\n So I do have an interest in the questions I ask\n\n1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:01.240\n because I think they're beautiful\n\n1:58:01.240 --> 1:58:02.880\n and I think the universe is beautiful.\n\n1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:06.360\n And I'm just so deeply fascinated\n\n1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:08.320\n by the fact that I exist at all.\n\n1:58:10.400 --> 1:58:13.920\n And so maybe it's that, you know,\n\n1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:15.600\n that intrinsic feeling of beauty\n\n1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:17.400\n that's in part driving, you know,\n\n1:58:17.400 --> 1:58:19.000\n the physics of creating more things.\n\n1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.080\n So they could be deeply related in that way.\n\n1:58:22.080 --> 1:58:24.680\n Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it.\n\n1:58:24.680 --> 1:58:27.120\n I think this conversation was beautiful.\n\n1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:29.760\n Thank you so much for wasting\n\n1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:31.920\n all your valuable time with me today.\n\n1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:33.520\n I really, really appreciate it, Sarah.\n\n1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:34.360\n This is an honor.\n\n1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.000\n I hope we get the chance to talk again.\n\n1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.120\n I hope, like I mentioned to you offline,\n\n1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:39.560\n we get a chance to talk with Lee.\n\n1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:44.560\n You guys have a beautiful, like, intellectual chemistry\n\n1:58:44.560 --> 1:58:45.760\n that's fascinating to listen to.\n\n1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:47.120\n So I'm a huge fan of both of you\n\n1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:49.440\n and I can't wait to see what you do next.\n\n1:58:49.440 --> 1:58:50.280\n Thanks so much.\n\n1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:51.320\n Great to be here.\n\n1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:52.160\n I am.\n\n1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:54.400\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:58:54.400 --> 1:58:57.680\n with Sarah Walker and thank you to Athletic Greens,\n\n1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:01.120\n Nat Sweet, Blinkist, and Magic Spoon.\n\n1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:04.360\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:06.040\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n1:59:06.040 --> 1:59:09.480\n from Robert Frost, one of my favorite poets.\n\n1:59:09.480 --> 1:59:11.640\n In three words, I can sum up everything\n\n1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:13.560\n I've learned about life.\n\n1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:15.120\n It goes on.\n\n1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:17.200\n Thank you for listening.\n\n1:59:17.200 --> 1:59:44.200\n I hope to see you next time.\n\n"
