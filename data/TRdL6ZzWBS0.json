What do you think?\n\n00:41.280 --> 00:48.240\n Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years\n\n00:48.240 --> 00:55.600\n ago. He pulled me into it out of physics instead. So I know his work pretty well. And in the years\n\n00:55.600 --> 01:01.040\n when I was at MIT running an institute, he was then in the philosophy department, used to come\n\n01:01.040 --> 01:08.160\n over all the time to the talks we held and so on. So what would I say about that? He, of course,\n\n01:08.160 --> 01:14.800\n developed his ideas a lot over the years. The thing that he's famous for, the structure of\n\n01:14.800 --> 01:24.720\n scientific revolutions came out in 62. And as you just said, it offered an outline for what he\n\n01:24.720 --> 01:31.280\n called a paradigmatic structure, namely the notion that you have to look at what scientists do as\n\n01:31.280 --> 01:38.800\n forming a community of investigators, and that they're trying to solve various puzzles, as he\n\n01:38.800 --> 01:44.800\n would put it, that crop up, figuring out how this works, how that works and so on. And of course,\n\n01:44.800 --> 01:49.760\n they don't do it out of the blue. They do it within a certain framework. The framework can\n\n01:49.760 --> 01:57.200\n be pretty vague. He called it a paradigm. And his notion was that eventually they run into troubles\n\n01:57.200 --> 02:03.680\n or what he called anomalies. That kind of cracks things. Somebody new comes along with a different\n\n02:03.680 --> 02:11.040\n way of doing it, etc. Do I think things work that way? No, not really. Tom and I used to have\n\n02:11.040 --> 02:20.000\n lengthy discussions about that over the years. I do think there is a common structure that\n\n02:20.000 --> 02:26.240\n formulates both theoretical and experimental practices. And historians nowadays of science\n\n02:26.240 --> 02:33.840\n like to refer to scientific work as what scientists practice. It's almost craftsman like.\n\n02:34.960 --> 02:41.840\n They can usually adapt in various ways. And I can give you all kinds of examples of that.\n\n02:41.840 --> 02:49.200\n I once wrote a book on the origins of wave theory of light. And that is one of the paradigmatic\n\n02:49.200 --> 02:56.960\n examples that Tom used. Only it didn't work that way exactly because he thought that what happened\n\n02:56.960 --> 03:04.720\n was that the wave theory ran into trouble with a certain phenomenon, which it couldn't crack.\n\n03:05.680 --> 03:13.520\n Well, it turned out that in fact, historically that phenomenon was actually not relevant\n\n03:13.520 --> 03:19.760\n later on to the wave theory. And when the wave theory came in, the alternative to it,\n\n03:19.760 --> 03:25.760\n which had prevailed, which was Newton's views light as particles that it seemed couldn't\n\n03:25.760 --> 03:33.200\n explain what the wave theory could explain. Again, not true. Not true. Much more complex\n\n03:33.200 --> 03:40.640\n than that. The wave theory offered the opportunity to deploy novel experimental and mathematical\n\n03:40.640 --> 03:47.520\n structures, which gave younger scientists, mathematicians and others, the opportunity\n\n03:47.520 --> 03:56.480\n to effect, manufacture, make new sorts of devices. It's not that the alternative couldn't sort of\n\n03:56.480 --> 04:04.160\n explain these things, but it never was able to generate them de novo as novelties. In other\n\n04:04.160 --> 04:10.640\n words, if you think of it as something scientists want to progress in the sense of finding new stuff\n\n04:10.640 --> 04:17.200\n to solve, then I think what often happens is that it's not so much that the prevailing view\n\n04:17.200 --> 04:22.480\n can't crack something as that it doesn't give you the opportunity to do new stuff.\n\n04:23.120 --> 04:27.280\n When you say new stuff, are we referring to experimental science here or\n\n04:27.280 --> 04:29.680\n new stuff in the space of new theories?\n\n04:29.680 --> 04:32.800\n Could be both. Could be both actually.\n\n04:32.800 --> 04:36.720\n So how does that... Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the story of the wave view?\n\n04:36.720 --> 04:43.840\n Sure. The prevailing view of light, at least in France where the wave theory really first took\n\n04:43.840 --> 04:49.040\n off, although it had been introduced in England by Thomas Young, the prevailing theory dates back\n\n04:49.040 --> 04:55.520\n to Newton that light is a stream of particles and that refraction and reflection involve sort\n\n04:55.520 --> 05:03.680\n of repulsive and attractive forces that deflect and bend the paths of these particles. Newton was\n\n05:03.680 --> 05:10.560\n not able successfully to deal with the phenomenon of what happens when light goes past a knife's\n\n05:10.560 --> 05:19.120\n edge or a sharp edge, what we now call diffraction. He had cooked up something about it that no\n\n05:19.120 --> 05:26.080\n mathematical structure could be applied. Thomas Young first, but really this guy named Augustin\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:35.840\n Fresnel in France deployed, in Fresnel's case, rather advanced calculus forms of mathematics,\n\n05:35.840 --> 05:41.840\n which enabled computations to be done and observations to be melded with these\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:49.120\n computations in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton. Did that mean that the\n\n05:49.120 --> 05:56.560\n Newtonian explanation of what goes on in diffraction fails? Not really. You can actually\n\n05:58.000 --> 06:05.280\n make it work, but you can't generate anything new out of it. Whereas using the mathematics\n\n06:05.280 --> 06:12.560\n of wave optics in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization, which ironically\n\n06:12.560 --> 06:18.960\n was discovered by partisans of Newton's way of doing things, you were able to generate devices\n\n06:20.240 --> 06:29.120\n which reflect light in crystals, do various things that the Newtonian way could accommodate only\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:36.480\n after the fact. They couldn't generate it from the beginning. And so if you want to be somebody who\n\n06:36.480 --> 06:44.720\n is working a novel vein, which increasingly becomes the case with people who become what we\n\n06:44.720 --> 06:51.120\n now call physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular, then that's the direction you're going\n\n06:51.120 --> 06:57.360\n to go. But there were holdouts until the 1850s. I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the\n\n06:57.360 --> 07:02.800\n disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn. So do you still believe in paradigm shifts? Do you still see\n\n07:02.800 --> 07:09.680\n that there's ideas that really have a transformational effect on science? The nature of\n\n07:09.680 --> 07:16.880\n the disagreement has to do with how those paradigm shifts come to be? How they come to be and how\n\n07:16.880 --> 07:25.280\n they change. I certainly think they exist. How strong they may be at any given time is maybe not\n\n07:25.280 --> 07:31.200\n quite as powerful as Tom thought in general. Although towards the end of his life, he was\n\n07:31.200 --> 07:38.720\n beginning to develop different modifications of his original way of thinking. But I don't think\n\n07:38.720 --> 07:47.840\n that the changes happened quite so neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental\n\n07:47.840 --> 07:56.880\n observations. They get much more complex than that. In terms of neatness, how much of science\n\n07:56.880 --> 08:05.360\n progresses by individual lone geniuses and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and\n\n08:05.360 --> 08:18.400\n cooperating humans? I don't think you can cut that with a knife to say it's this percent and\n\n08:18.400 --> 08:27.680\n that percent. It's almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three individuals\n\n08:27.680 --> 08:37.840\n who are sort of central to what goes on when things begin to shift. Are they inevitably and\n\n08:37.840 --> 08:48.080\n solely responsible for what then begins to happen in a major way? I think not. It depends. You can\n\n08:48.080 --> 08:59.200\n go very far back with this, even into antiquity to see what goes on. The major locus we always\n\n08:59.200 --> 09:04.320\n talk about from the beginning is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion, for example,\n\n09:05.680 --> 09:11.760\n were there ways of accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:19.600\n scheme? Yes. Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do\n\n09:19.600 --> 09:26.160\n other things with it that you couldn't otherwise do? Also, yes. Let me give you an example.\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:32.720\n The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes, who was a mechanical philosopher,\n\n09:32.720 --> 09:38.880\n he believed the world was matter in motion. He never thought much of what Galileo had done\n\n09:38.880 --> 09:44.000\n in respect to motion because he thought, well, at best, it's some sort of approximative scheme\n\n09:44.000 --> 09:51.600\n or something like that. But one of his initial, I wouldn't call him a disciple, but follower,\n\n09:51.600 --> 09:56.960\n who then broke with him in a number of ways, was a man named Christian Huygens, who was,\n\n09:56.960 --> 10:02.640\n along with Newton, one of the two greatest scientists of the 17th century. Huygens is\n\n10:02.640 --> 10:10.880\n older than Newton, and Huygens nicely deployed Galilean relationships in respect to motion\n\n10:11.440 --> 10:17.200\n to develop all sorts of things, including the first pendulum governed clock,\n\n10:19.280 --> 10:24.720\n and even figured out how to build one, which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work. But\n\n10:24.720 --> 10:28.400\n he had the mathematical structure for it. How well known is Huygens?\n\n10:28.400 --> 10:31.040\n Oh, very well known. Should I know him well?\n\n10:31.040 --> 10:33.280\n Yes, you should. Interesting.\n\n10:33.280 --> 10:34.560\n You should definitely know him.\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:37.760\n No, no, no, no, no. Can we define should here?\n\n10:37.760 --> 10:38.240\n Okay.\n\n10:38.240 --> 10:38.960\n Because I don't.\n\n10:39.600 --> 10:40.100\n Right.\n\n10:40.880 --> 10:46.880\n So is this should like, yeah, can you define should?\n\n10:48.640 --> 10:55.360\n Should means this. If you had taken up to a second year physics courses, you should,\n\n10:55.360 --> 11:00.640\n you would have heard his name because one of the fundamental principles in optics is called\n\n11:00.640 --> 11:01.760\n Huygens principle.\n\n11:03.280 --> 11:03.680\n Okay.\n\n11:03.680 --> 11:04.320\n Okay.\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:07.040\n Yeah, so I have and I have heard his name.\n\n11:07.040 --> 11:07.920\n There you go.\n\n11:07.920 --> 11:08.800\n No, but I don't remember.\n\n11:08.800 --> 11:09.760\n But you don't remember.\n\n11:09.760 --> 11:16.640\n So I mean, there's a very different thing between names attached to principles and laws and so on\n\n11:16.640 --> 11:21.520\n that you sometimes let go of, you just remember the equations of the principles themselves,\n\n11:21.520 --> 11:25.760\n and the personalities of science. And there's certain personalities,\n\n11:25.760 --> 11:32.880\n certain human beings that stand out. And that's why there's a sense to which the lone inventor,\n\n11:32.880 --> 11:38.880\n the lone scientist is the way I personally mean, I think a lot of people think about the history\n\n11:38.880 --> 11:45.760\n of science is these lone geniuses. Without them, the senses, if you remove Newton from the picture,\n\n11:45.760 --> 11:51.520\n if you remove Galileo from the picture, then science would, there's almost a feeling like\n\n11:51.520 --> 11:57.360\n it would just have stopped there. Or at the very least, there's a feeling like it would take much\n\n11:57.360 --> 12:01.840\n longer to develop the things that were developed. Is that a silly way to look at the history?\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:12.800\n That's not entirely incorrect, I suppose. I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not\n\n12:12.800 --> 12:19.680\n existed, that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance, given the context of the time,\n\n12:19.680 --> 12:27.440\n what was floating around in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on,\n\n12:27.440 --> 12:34.560\n the developments in mathematics and whatnot, that sooner or later, whether it would have been\n\n12:34.560 --> 12:41.120\n exactly the same or not, I cannot say. But would things have evolved? Yes.\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:54.080\n If we look at the long arc of history of science, from back when we were in the caves trying to knock\n\n12:54.080 --> 13:03.040\n two rocks together, or maybe make a basic tool to a long time from now, many centuries from now,\n\n13:03.040 --> 13:09.680\n when human civilization finally destroys itself. If we look at that history, and imagine you're\n\n13:09.680 --> 13:16.800\n a historian at the end, like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us, and you look back at\n\n13:16.800 --> 13:26.000\n this time in the 21st century, how far along are we on that arc? Do you sense? Have we invented\n\n13:26.000 --> 13:33.440\n and discovered everything that's to be discovered, or are we at like below 1%? You're going to get a\n\n13:33.440 --> 13:39.920\n lot of absurd questions today. I apologize. It's a lugubrious picture you're painting there.\n\n13:39.920 --> 13:44.560\n I don't even know what the word lugubrious means, but I love it. Lugubrious.\n\n13:44.560 --> 13:51.200\n Well, let me try and separate the question of whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse\n\n13:51.200 --> 13:57.680\n in several hundred years or not from the question of where science may be sitting.\n\n13:57.680 --> 14:06.160\n Take that as an assumption. Okay. I find that hard to say. And I find it hard to say\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:17.280\n because in the deepest sense of the term, as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today,\n\n14:17.280 --> 14:29.520\n I'm not fundamentally a realist. That is to say, I think our access to the inner workings of nature\n\n14:30.080 --> 14:40.400\n is inevitably mediated by what we can do with the materials and factors around us. We can probe\n\n14:40.400 --> 14:47.200\n things in various ways. Does that mean that I don't think that the standard model in quantum\n\n14:47.200 --> 14:52.400\n electrodynamics is incorrect? Of course not. I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing.\n\n14:52.400 --> 14:59.040\n It can do a lot, especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening in very large,\n\n14:59.040 --> 15:07.280\n expensive particle accelerators and applying results in cosmology and so on as well.\n\n15:09.280 --> 15:16.880\n Do I think that we have inevitably probed the depths of reality through this? I do not agree\n\n15:16.880 --> 15:23.920\n with Steven Weinberg who thinks we have about such things. Do I, on the other hand, think that\n\n15:24.720 --> 15:30.640\n the way in which science has been moving for the last hundred years, physics in particular is what\n\n15:30.640 --> 15:38.160\n I have in mind, will continue on the same course? In that sense, I don't because we're not going to\n\n15:38.160 --> 15:44.560\n be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive machines to rip apart particles in\n\n15:44.560 --> 15:50.640\n various ways. In which case, what are physicists going to do? They'll turn their attention to other\n\n15:50.640 --> 15:57.360\n aspects. There are all sorts of things we've never explained about the material world.\n\n15:57.360 --> 16:02.160\n We don't have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things.\n\n16:04.240 --> 16:09.600\n Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical\n\n16:09.600 --> 16:17.200\n transformations? You can make an argument about it and you can justify things, but in chemistry,\n\n16:17.200 --> 16:22.560\n that's not the way people work. They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships\n\n16:22.560 --> 16:33.200\n and so on. This notion of the deep theory to explain everything is a longstanding belief\n\n16:33.200 --> 16:39.760\n which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:47.600\n sometime towards the end of the 19th century. Maybe we just speak to that. You're referring to\n\n16:48.640 --> 16:54.400\n a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything.\n\n16:55.200 --> 16:58.720\n There's a very specific thing that that currently means in physics,\n\n16:58.720 --> 17:06.000\n is the unification of the laws of physics. But I'm sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe\n\n17:06.000 --> 17:11.120\n something else, or is it always about physics? Because I mean, I think as you've kind of implied\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:17.200\n in physics, there's a sense once you get to the theory of everything, you've understood everything,\n\n17:17.760 --> 17:21.360\n but there's a very deep sense in which you've actually understood not very much at all.\n\n17:21.920 --> 17:26.880\n You've understood at that particular level how things work, but you don't understand how the\n\n17:26.880 --> 17:31.280\n abstractions on top of abstractions form, all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind,\n\n17:31.280 --> 17:37.440\n and the human societies, and all those kinds of things. So maybe you can speak to the theory of\n\n17:37.440 --> 17:42.480\n everything and its history and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything.\n\n17:43.040 --> 17:48.800\n Well, I don't think you can go back that far with something like that. Maybe to the, at best,\n\n17:48.800 --> 17:53.840\n to the 17th century. If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are, of course,\n\n17:53.840 --> 18:07.040\n discussions about the nature of the world. But first of all, you have to recognize that the\n\n18:07.040 --> 18:17.680\n manipulative character of physics and chemistry, the probing of... Let me put it this way. We assume\n\n18:17.680 --> 18:26.400\n and have assumed for a long time, I'll come back to when in a moment, that if I take a little device,\n\n18:26.400 --> 18:33.360\n which is really complicatedly made out of all kinds of things, and I put a piece of some material in\n\n18:33.360 --> 18:39.760\n it, and I monkey around with it and do all kinds of unnatural things to it, things that wouldn't\n\n18:39.760 --> 18:46.880\n happen naturally, and I find out how it behaves and whatnot, and then I try and make an argument\n\n18:46.880 --> 18:54.240\n about how that really applies even in the natural world without any artificial structures and so on.\n\n18:54.240 --> 19:01.840\n That's not a belief that was widely held by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe\n\n19:01.840 --> 19:08.080\n in the 1500s. And when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists.\n\n19:08.880 --> 19:13.360\n So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of\n\n19:13.360 --> 19:20.720\n everything. I would put it a little differently. I think it's more along the way, a dream that\n\n19:20.720 --> 19:30.080\n by probing nature in artificially constructed ways, we can find out what's going on deep down there.\n\n19:32.640 --> 19:39.200\n So that's distinct from science being an observing thing, where you observe nature\n\n19:39.200 --> 19:44.720\n and you study nature. You're talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it.\n\n19:45.520 --> 19:52.000\n Indeed I am. But that, of course, is the very essence of experimental science. You have to\n\n19:54.000 --> 20:03.120\n manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince others that you haven't\n\n20:03.120 --> 20:10.880\n so manipulated it that what you've done is to produce what amounts to fake artifactual behavior\n\n20:10.880 --> 20:18.160\n that doesn't really hold purely naturally. So where are we today in your sense to jump\n\n20:18.160 --> 20:26.160\n around a little bit with the theory of everything? Maybe a quick kind of sense you have about the\n\n20:26.160 --> 20:30.320\n journey in the world of physics that we're taking towards the theory of everything.\n\n20:30.320 --> 20:36.560\n Well, I'm, of course, not a practicing physicist. I mean, I was trained in physics at Princeton\n\n20:36.560 --> 20:39.600\n a long time ago. Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away.\n\n20:40.400 --> 20:45.200\n More or less. I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity. I was an\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:49.120\n undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him and...\n\n20:49.840 --> 20:56.240\n Well, you made the mistake of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back.\n\n20:56.240 --> 21:06.080\n I suppose so in a way. From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech,\n\n21:08.080 --> 21:17.040\n like Kip Thorne and others, the fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even\n\n21:17.040 --> 21:26.560\n at the deepest level we can sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are\n\n21:26.560 --> 21:32.880\n perhaps quite unique to this particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang.\n\n21:34.560 --> 21:43.200\n The question is, how deep does it go? If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion\n\n21:43.200 --> 21:52.640\n for several decades now has been what's called string theory, but that has not been able to\n\n21:53.360 --> 22:00.400\n figure a way to generate probative experimental evidence, although it's pretty good apparently\n\n22:00.400 --> 22:08.400\n at accommodating things. Then the question is, what's before the Big Bang? Actually,\n\n22:08.400 --> 22:17.280\n the word before doesn't mean anything given the nature of time, but why do we have the\n\n22:17.280 --> 22:24.720\n laws that prevail in our universe? Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe\n\n22:26.240 --> 22:28.560\n because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here.\n\n22:30.560 --> 22:35.600\n That's a bit of a cyclical, but nevertheless, a compelling definition. And there's all kinds\n\n22:35.600 --> 22:42.000\n of things like it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered by looking\n\n22:42.000 --> 22:45.920\n inside of a black hole because you get both the general relativity and the quantum mechanics,\n\n22:45.920 --> 22:51.920\n quantum field theory in there. Experimentally, of course, there's a lot of interesting ideas.\n\n22:51.920 --> 22:57.920\n We can't really look close to the Big Bang. We can't look that far back. Caltech and MIT will\n\n22:57.920 --> 23:03.120\n LIGO looking at gravitational waves, perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on. Yeah,\n\n23:03.120 --> 23:07.200\n it's really exciting space. And there's, of course, the theory of everything,\n\n23:07.920 --> 23:13.200\n like with a lot of things in science, captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely\n\n23:13.200 --> 23:20.160\n outside of science. It's the dream of discovering the key to the nature of how everything works.\n\n23:21.360 --> 23:31.120\n And that feels deeply human. That's perhaps the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in\n\n23:31.120 --> 23:39.600\n the end is that curiosity, that longing to understand. Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement\n\n23:39.600 --> 23:48.320\n with Weinberg on reality. Could you elaborate a little bit? Well, obviously, I don't disagree\n\n23:48.320 --> 23:55.280\n with Steve Weinberg on physics itself. I wouldn't know enough to even begin to do that. And clearly,\n\n23:55.280 --> 24:02.000\n you know, he's one of the founders of the standard model and so on. And it works to a level of\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:09.920\n accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before. I suppose the question in my mind is\n\n24:10.720 --> 24:18.000\n something that in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century,\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:29.600\n namely, can we really ever convince ourselves that we have come to grips with something that is\n\n24:30.320 --> 24:41.680\n not in itself knowable to us by our senses, or even except in the most remote way through the\n\n24:41.680 --> 24:48.320\n complex instruments that we make as to what it is that underlies everything? Can we corral it\n\n24:48.960 --> 24:57.760\n with mathematics and experimental structures? Yes. Do I think that a particular way of corraling\n\n24:57.760 --> 25:06.240\n nature will inevitably play itself out? I don't know. It always has. I'll put it to you that way.\n\n25:06.240 --> 25:18.320\n So the basic question is, can we know reality? Is that the Kant question? Is that the Weinberg\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:28.960\n question? We humans, with our brains, can we comprehend reality? Sounds like a very trippy\n\n25:28.960 --> 25:34.480\n question because a lot of it rests on definitions of know and comprehend and reality. But\n\n25:34.480 --> 25:44.080\n get to the bottom of it. It's turtles on top of turtles. Can we get to the bottom turtle and say\n\n25:44.080 --> 25:56.240\n hello? Well, maybe I can put it to you this way in a way that I often begin discussions in a class\n\n25:56.240 --> 26:07.120\n on the history of science and so on, and say, I'm looking at you. Yes. You are in fact a figment of\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:15.040\n my imagination. You have a messed up imagination, yes. Well, what do I mean by that? If I were a\n\n26:15.040 --> 26:28.400\n dragonfly looking at you, whatever my nervous system would form by way of a perceptual structure\n\n26:29.120 --> 26:39.040\n would clearly be utterly different from what my brain and perceptual system altogether is forming\n\n26:39.040 --> 26:48.160\n when I look at you. Who's right? Is it me or the dragonfly?\n\n26:51.680 --> 26:57.600\n Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive, so I don't know. But yes, the observer matters.\n\n27:02.400 --> 27:06.240\n What is that supposed to tell us about objective reality?\n\n27:06.240 --> 27:16.080\n Well, I think it means that it's very difficult to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual\n\n27:16.080 --> 27:24.400\n system is leading us to. When we make apparatus and devices and so on, we're still making things,\n\n27:25.120 --> 27:30.640\n the results of which or the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways.\n\n27:30.640 --> 27:36.560\n An analogy I like to use with students sometimes is this. All right, they all have their laptops\n\n27:36.560 --> 27:45.760\n open in front of them, of course. I've sent them something to read, and I say, okay, click on it\n\n27:45.760 --> 27:51.920\n and open it up. PDF opens up. I said, what are you looking at? They said, well, I'm looking at the\n\n27:51.920 --> 27:57.520\n paper that you sent me. I said, no, you're not. What you're looking at is what you're looking at\n\n27:57.520 --> 28:06.000\n is a stream of light coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen. And I said, what happens when you\n\n28:06.000 --> 28:12.320\n use your mouse and move that fake piece of paper on the screen around? What are you doing? You're\n\n28:12.320 --> 28:18.080\n not moving a piece of paper around, are you? You're moving a construct around, a construct\n\n28:18.080 --> 28:24.080\n that's being processed so that our perceptual system can interact with it in the way we\n\n28:24.080 --> 28:34.800\n interact with pieces of paper. Yes. But it's not real. So, are there things outside of the reach\n\n28:34.800 --> 28:43.120\n of science? Can you maybe, as an example, talk about consciousness? I'm asking for a friend\n\n28:43.120 --> 28:52.640\n trying to figure this thing out. Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit of science, but I don't\n\n28:52.640 --> 28:58.240\n know. I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly can't really say much about it.\n\n29:02.880 --> 29:08.640\n I'm a materialist in the deepest sense of the term. I don't think there is anything out there\n\n29:09.280 --> 29:16.480\n except material structures which interact in various ways. Do I think, for example,\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:23.920\n that this bottle of water is conscious? No, I do not. Although, how would I know? I can't talk to\n\n29:23.920 --> 29:29.760\n it. Yeah. But, so what do... It's a hypothesis you have. It's an opinion, an educated opinion\n\n29:29.760 --> 29:35.200\n that may be very wrong. Well, I know that you're conscious because I can interact directly with you.\n\n29:35.200 --> 29:41.040\n But am I? Well, unless you're a figment of my imagination, of course. Or I'm a robot that's\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:48.640\n able to generate the illusion of consciousness effectively enough to facilitate a good\n\n29:48.640 --> 29:52.560\n conversation. Because we humans do want to pretend that we're talking to other conscious beings.\n\n29:52.560 --> 29:56.880\n That's how we respect them. If it's not conscious, we don't respect them. We're not good at talking\n\n29:56.880 --> 30:01.280\n to robots. That's true. Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense, which is the kind of\n\n30:01.280 --> 30:07.120\n thing Descartes said from the beginning. We generalize from that. But I do think that\n\n30:07.120 --> 30:14.240\n consciousness must be something, whatever it is, that occurs as a result of some particular\n\n30:14.240 --> 30:24.400\n organizational structure of material elements. Does materialism mean that it's all within the\n\n30:24.400 --> 30:35.680\n reach of science? My sense would be that, especially as neuroscience progresses more and more and\n\n30:35.680 --> 30:44.320\n at Caltech, we just built a whole neuroscience arena and so on. And as more knowledge is gained\n\n30:44.320 --> 30:52.800\n about the ways in which animals, when they behave, what patterns show up at various parts of the\n\n30:52.800 --> 31:00.480\n brain and nervous system, and perhaps extending it to humans eventually as well, we'll get more of a\n\n31:00.480 --> 31:12.880\n we'll get more of a handle on what brain activity is associated with experiences that we have as\n\n31:12.880 --> 31:20.560\n humans. Can we move from the brain activity to the experiences in terms of our perception? No,\n\n31:20.560 --> 31:26.560\n you can't. Perception is perception. That's the hypothesis, once again.\n\n31:26.560 --> 31:35.760\n Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of physics that's yet to be discovered. Maybe it\n\n31:35.760 --> 31:44.800\n permeates all matter. Maybe it's as simple as trying to plug it in and plug into the ability\n\n31:44.800 --> 31:52.000\n to generate and control that kind of law of physics that would crack open. Or we would understand\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:56.880\n that the bottle of water is in fact conscious, just much less conscious than us humans,\n\n31:56.880 --> 32:00.960\n and then we would be able to generate beings that are more conscious.\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:06.400\n Well, that'll be unfortunate. I'd have to stop drinking the water after that.\n\n32:06.400 --> 32:11.360\n Every time you take a sip, there's a little bit of suffering going on.\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:11.600\n Right.\n\n32:12.320 --> 32:18.080\n What do you use the most interesting, beautiful moments in the history of science? What stands\n\n32:18.080 --> 32:22.160\n out? And then we can pull at that thread.\n\n32:22.160 --> 32:32.960\n Right. Well, I like to think of events that have a major impact and involve both beautiful,\n\n32:34.560 --> 32:41.440\n conceptual, mathematical, if we're talking physical structures work, and are associated as\n\n32:41.440 --> 32:50.960\n well with probing experimental situations. So among my favorites is one of the most famous,\n\n32:51.520 --> 32:59.040\n which was the young Isaac Newton's work with the colors produced when you pass sunlight through a\n\n32:59.040 --> 33:08.720\n prism. And why do I like that? It's not profoundly mathematical in one sense. It doesn't need it\n\n33:08.720 --> 33:14.320\n initially. It needs the following though, which begins to show you I think a little bit about what\n\n33:14.320 --> 33:19.440\n gets involved when you've got a smart individual who's trying to monkey around with stuff and\n\n33:19.440 --> 33:26.560\n finds new things about it. First, let me say that the prevailing notion going back to antiquity\n\n33:26.560 --> 33:34.720\n was that colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light, that they're\n\n33:34.720 --> 33:41.200\n modifications of white light. In other words, the colors are not in the sunlight in any way.\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:49.680\n Now, what Newton did following experiments done by Descartes before him who came to very different\n\n33:49.680 --> 33:59.680\n conclusions, he took a prism. You might ask, where do you get prisms in the 1660s? County fairs,\n\n33:59.680 --> 34:03.840\n they were very popular. They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything,\n\n34:03.840 --> 34:08.000\n but they produced colors. So you could buy them at county fairs and things very popular.\n\n34:08.000 --> 34:11.360\n Oh, so they were modifying the white light to create colors.\n\n34:11.360 --> 34:18.400\n Well, they were creating colors from it, well known. And what he did was the following. He\n\n34:18.400 --> 34:25.680\n was by this time, even though he's very young, a very good mathematician. And he could use the\n\n34:26.320 --> 34:32.320\n then known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen\n\n34:32.320 --> 34:39.120\n if you took light from the sun, passed it from a hole, through a little hole, then hit the prism,\n\n34:39.600 --> 34:45.040\n goes out of the prism, strikes a wall a long distance away and makes a splash of light,\n\n34:45.040 --> 34:49.680\n never mind the colors for a moment, makes a splash of light there. He was very smart.\n\n34:50.400 --> 34:56.080\n First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that's what everybody's\n\n34:56.080 --> 35:01.760\n paying attention to initially. Because what he knows is this, he knows that if you take\n\n35:01.760 --> 35:09.760\n this prism and you turn it to a certain particular angle, that he knew what it should be because he\n\n35:09.760 --> 35:16.320\n could calculate things. Very few other people in Europe at the time could calculate things like he\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:23.280\n could. That if you turn the prism to that particular angle, then the sun, which is, of course, a\n\n35:23.280 --> 35:30.160\n circle, when its light passes through this little hole and then into the prism on the far distant\n\n35:30.160 --> 35:43.520\n wall, should still make a circle. But it doesn't. It makes a very long image. And this led him to a\n\n35:43.520 --> 35:48.800\n very different conception of light, indicating that there are different types of light in the\n\n35:48.800 --> 35:54.640\n sunlight. Now, to go beyond that, what's particularly interesting, I think, is the following.\n\n35:54.640 --> 36:02.320\n When he published this paper, which got him into a controversy, he really didn't describe\n\n36:02.320 --> 36:08.000\n at all what he did. He just gave you some numbers. Now, I just told you that you had to set this\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:14.880\n prism at a certain angle, right? You would think, because we do have his notes and so on,\n\n36:16.320 --> 36:22.080\n you would think that he took some kind of complicated measuring device to set the prism.\n\n36:22.080 --> 36:30.320\n He didn't. He held it in his hand. That's all. And he twiddled it around. And what was he doing?\n\n36:30.320 --> 36:36.960\n It turns out that when you twiddle the prism around at the point where you should get a circle\n\n36:36.960 --> 36:43.840\n from a circle, it also is the place where the image does not move very fast. So if you want\n\n36:43.840 --> 36:52.880\n to get close to there, you just twiddle it. This is manipulative experimentation taking advantage\n\n36:52.880 --> 37:00.800\n through his mathematical knowledge of the inherent inaccuracies that let you come to\n\n37:00.800 --> 37:09.040\n exact conclusions, regardless of the built in problematics of measurement. He's the only one\n\n37:09.040 --> 37:15.840\n I know of doing anything like that at the time. Yeah. Well, even still, there's very few people\n\n37:15.840 --> 37:23.040\n that are able to have to calculate as well as he did to be a theoretician and an experimentalist,\n\n37:23.600 --> 37:35.360\n like in the same moment. It's true, although until really well into the 20th century,\n\n37:35.360 --> 37:44.400\n maybe the beginning of the 20th century, really, most of the most significant experimental results\n\n37:45.040 --> 37:52.480\n produced in the 1800s, which laid the foundations for light, electricity, electrodynamics, and so on,\n\n37:53.520 --> 38:02.960\n even hydrodynamics and whatnot, were also produced by people who are both excellent calculators,\n\n38:02.960 --> 38:09.280\n very talented mathematicians, and good with their hands experimentally.\n\n38:11.360 --> 38:18.640\n And then that led to the 21st century with Enrico Fermi that one of the last people that\n\n38:18.640 --> 38:25.200\n was able to do that, both of those things very well, and that he built a little device\n\n38:25.200 --> 38:28.960\n called an atomic bomb that has some positives and negatives.\n\n38:28.960 --> 38:34.640\n Well, right. Of course, that actually did involve some pretty large scale elaborate\n\n38:34.640 --> 38:38.800\n equipment too. Well, holding a prism in your hands.\n\n38:38.800 --> 38:44.480\n Right. No. What's the controversy that Newton got into with that paper when he published it?\n\n38:45.840 --> 38:54.560\n Well, in a number of ways, it's a complicated story. There was a very talented character\n\n38:54.560 --> 39:00.240\n known as a mechanic. Mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman who could build and make\n\n39:00.240 --> 39:05.920\n really good stuff. And he was very talented. His name was Robert Hooke. And he was the guy who\n\n39:06.480 --> 39:11.280\n at the weekly meetings of the Royal Society in London, and Newton's not in London, he's at\n\n39:11.280 --> 39:18.160\n Cambridge, he's a young guy, he would demonstrate new things. And he was very clever. And he had\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:26.480\n written a book, in fact, called the Micrographia, which by the way, he used a microscope to make\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:31.920\n the first depictions of things like a fly's eye, the structure of, you know, it had a big influence.\n\n39:31.920 --> 39:36.880\n And in there, he also talked about light. And so he had a different view of light. And when he read\n\n39:36.880 --> 39:44.480\n what Newton wrote, he had a double reaction. On the one hand, he said, anything in there that is\n\n39:44.480 --> 39:51.680\n correct, I already knew. And anything that I didn't already know, is probably not right anyway.\n\n39:51.680 --> 39:58.320\n Trey Lockerbie I gotta love egos. Okay. Can we just step\n\n39:58.320 --> 40:05.200\n back? Can you say who was Isaac Newton? What are the things he contributed to this world\n\n40:05.200 --> 40:17.840\n in the space of ideas? Wow. Who was he? He was born in 1642,\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:25.360\n and near the small town of Grantham in England. In fact, the house he was born in,\n\n40:26.080 --> 40:29.280\n and that his mother died in is still there and can be visited.\n\n40:29.280 --> 40:41.760\n His father died before he was born. And his mother eventually remarried a man named\n\n40:41.760 --> 40:52.160\n Reverend Smith, whom Newton did not like at all. Because Reverend Smith took his mother away to\n\n40:52.160 --> 40:57.200\n live with him a few miles away, leaving Newton to be brought up more or less by his grandmother\n\n40:57.200 --> 41:01.920\n over there. And he had huge resentment about that his whole life.\n\n41:02.880 --> 41:08.320\n I think that gives you a little inkling that a little bit of trauma in childhood,\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:13.200\n maybe a complicated father son relationship can be useful to create a good scientist.\n\n41:13.920 --> 41:19.120\n Could be, although this case, it would be right, the absent father, non father relationship,\n\n41:19.120 --> 41:26.240\n so to speak. He was known as a kid, little that we do know for being very clever about\n\n41:26.240 --> 41:34.640\n flying kites. And there are stories about him putting candles and putting flying kites and\n\n41:34.640 --> 41:39.120\n scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and things like that,\n\n41:39.120 --> 41:47.120\n making things. Most of the physicists and natural philosophers I've dealt with actually,\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:54.400\n as children, were very fond of making and playing with things. I can't think of one I know of who\n\n41:54.400 --> 42:06.640\n wasn't actually, very good with their hands and whatnot. His mother wanted him to take over the\n\n42:06.640 --> 42:11.520\n manor. It was a kind of farming manor. They were the class of what are known as yeomans.\n\n42:12.160 --> 42:17.600\n There are stories that he wasn't very good at that. One day, one of the stories is he's sitting\n\n42:17.600 --> 42:24.480\n out in the field and the cows come home without him and he doesn't know what's going on. Anyway,\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:30.960\n had relatives and he manages to get to Cambridge, sent to Cambridge because he's known to be smart.\n\n42:30.960 --> 42:37.600\n He's read books that he got from local dignitaries and some relatives. And he goes there as what's\n\n42:37.600 --> 42:43.200\n known as a sub sizer. What does that mean? Well, it's not too pleasant. Basically, a sub sizer\n\n42:43.200 --> 42:50.960\n was a student who had to clean the bed pans of the richer kids. That didn't last too long.\n\n42:50.960 --> 43:00.240\n He makes his way and he becomes absorbed in some of the new ways of thinking that are being talked\n\n43:00.240 --> 43:06.560\n about on the parts of Descartes and others as well. There's also the traditional curriculum,\n\n43:06.560 --> 43:12.400\n which he follows. And we have his notes. We have his student notebooks and so on. We can see\n\n43:12.400 --> 43:20.240\n gradually this young man's mind focusing and coming to grips with deeper questions of the\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:27.440\n nature of the world and perception even, and how we know things and also probing and learning\n\n43:28.640 --> 43:35.760\n mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds on some of the investigations that had been\n\n43:35.760 --> 43:43.200\n done in the period before him to create the foundations of a way of investigating processes\n\n43:43.200 --> 43:50.000\n that happen and change continuously instead of by leaps and bounds and so on, forming the\n\n43:50.000 --> 43:56.160\n foundation of what we now call the calculus. Yeah. So can you maybe just paint a little bit\n\n43:56.160 --> 44:04.000\n of a picture you've already started of what were the things that bothered him the most\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:11.280\n that stood out to him the most about the traditional curriculum, about the way people\n\n44:11.280 --> 44:16.080\n saw the world? You mentioned discrete versus continuous. Is there something where he began\n\n44:16.080 --> 44:21.200\n thinking in a revolutionary way? Because it's fascinating. Most of us go to college,\n\n44:22.560 --> 44:30.560\n Cambridge or otherwise, and we just kind of take what we hear as gospel, right? Like not gospel,\n\n44:30.560 --> 44:39.440\n but as like facts. You don't begin to sort of see how can I expand on this aggressively or how can\n\n44:39.440 --> 44:46.960\n I challenge everything that I hear rigorously, mathematically through the... I mean, I don't even\n\n44:46.960 --> 44:52.480\n know how rigorous the mathematics was at that point. I'm sure it was geometry and so on,\n\n44:52.480 --> 45:00.160\n no calculus, huh? There are elements of what turned into the calculus that predate Newton,\n\n45:00.160 --> 45:06.560\n but... How much rigor was there? How much... Well, rigor, no. And then, of course, no scientific\n\n45:06.560 --> 45:15.120\n method. Not really. I mean, somewhat. I mean, appreciation of data. That is a separate question\n\n45:15.120 --> 45:20.960\n from a question of method. Appreciation of data is a significant question as to what you do with\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:26.320\n data. There's lots of things you're asking. I apologize. So maybe let's backtrack in the first\n\n45:26.320 --> 45:32.640\n question. Was there something that was bothering him that he especially thought he could contribute\n\n45:32.640 --> 45:38.480\n or work on? Well, of course, we can't go back and talk to him, but we do have these student\n\n45:38.480 --> 45:43.920\n notebooks. There's two of them. One's called The Philosophical Questions and the other is called\n\n45:43.920 --> 45:49.840\n The Waste Book. The Philosophical Questions has discussions of the nature of reality and\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:55.760\n various issues concerning it. And The Waste Book has things that have to do with motion in various\n\n45:55.760 --> 46:01.760\n ways, what happens in collisions and things of that sort. And it's a complicated story,\n\n46:01.760 --> 46:07.760\n but what's among the things that I think are interesting is he took notes in The Philosophical\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:17.120\n Questions on stuff that was traditionally given to you in the curriculums going back several hundred\n\n46:17.120 --> 46:25.840\n years, namely on what scholars refer to as scholastic or neo scholastic ways of thinking\n\n46:25.840 --> 46:32.800\n about the world dating back to the reformulation of Aristotle in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas\n\n46:32.800 --> 46:37.840\n in the church. This is a totally different way of thinking about things, which actually connects to\n\n46:37.840 --> 46:45.760\n something we were saying a moment ago. For instance, so I'm wearing a blue shirt and I will\n\n46:45.760 --> 46:51.360\n sometimes ask students, where is the blue? And they'll usually say, well, it's in your shirt.\n\n46:52.080 --> 46:56.240\n And then some of them get clear and they say, well, no, you know, light is striking it,\n\n46:56.240 --> 47:01.360\n photons are reemitted, they strike the back of your retina and et cetera, et cetera. And I said,\n\n47:01.360 --> 47:10.880\n yes. What that means is that the blue is actually an artifact of our perceptual system considered as\n\n47:10.880 --> 47:20.400\n the percept of blue. It's not out there, it's in here. That's not how things were thought about\n\n47:21.040 --> 47:28.800\n well into the 16th century. The general notion dating back even to Aristotelian antiquity\n\n47:28.800 --> 47:39.120\n and formalized by the 12th century at Paris, Oxford and elsewhere is that qualities are there\n\n47:39.120 --> 47:48.400\n in the world. They're not in us. We have senses and our senses can be wrong. You could go blind,\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:55.440\n things like that. But if they're working properly, you get the actual qualities of the world.\n\n47:55.440 --> 48:02.960\n Now, that break, which is occurring towards the end of the 16th century and is most visible in\n\n48:02.960 --> 48:11.280\n Descartes, is the break between conceiving that the qualities of the world are very different\n\n48:12.160 --> 48:17.920\n from the qualities that we perceive. That in fact, the qualities of the world consist almost\n\n48:17.920 --> 48:28.640\n entirely in shapes of various kinds and maybe hard particles or whatever, but not colors,\n\n48:28.640 --> 48:36.240\n not sounds, not smells, not softness and hardness. They're not in the world, they're in us.\n\n48:37.840 --> 48:43.280\n That break Newton is picking up as he reads Descartes. He's going to disagree with a lot in\n\n48:43.280 --> 48:50.800\n Descartes, but that break he is, among other things, picking up very strongly. And that\n\n48:50.800 --> 48:58.080\n underlies a lot of the way he works later on when he becomes skeptical of the evidence provided\n\n48:58.080 --> 49:05.040\n by the senses. Yeah, that's actually, I don't know, the way you're describing is so powerful.\n\n49:05.040 --> 49:11.920\n It just makes me realize how liberating that is as a scientist, as somebody who's trying\n\n49:11.920 --> 49:24.480\n to understand reality, that our senses are not to be trusted, that reality is to be investigated\n\n49:24.480 --> 49:33.280\n through tools that are beyond our senses. Yes, or that improve our senses in some ways.\n\n49:34.320 --> 49:49.680\n That's pretty powerful. For a human being to realize I can't trust my own senses at that time,\n\n49:49.680 --> 49:59.040\n that's pretty trippy. It's coming in, it's coming in. And I think it arises probably a fair number\n\n49:59.040 --> 50:05.520\n of decades before that, perhaps in part with all chemical experimentation and manipulations,\n\n50:05.520 --> 50:12.560\n that you have to go through elaborate structures to produce things and ways you think about it.\n\n50:13.280 --> 50:17.680\n But let me give you an example that I think you might find interesting because it's from\n\n50:17.680 --> 50:24.640\n it involves that guy named Hooke that Newton had an argument with. And he had lots of arguments\n\n50:24.640 --> 50:30.400\n with Hooke, although Hooke was a very clever guy and gave him some things that stimulated him later.\n\n50:30.400 --> 50:38.720\n Anyway, Hooke, who was argumentative, and he really was convinced that the only way to gain\n\n50:38.720 --> 50:47.440\n real knowledge of nature is through carefully constructed devices. And he was an expert\n\n50:48.080 --> 50:59.520\n mechanic, if you will, at building such things. Now, there was a rather wealthy man in Danzig\n\n51:00.320 --> 51:06.720\n by the name of Hevelius, Latinized name. He was a brewer in town. And he had become very\n\n51:06.720 --> 51:14.720\n fascinated with the telescope. This is 30 years or so, 20 or 30 years after the telescope had\n\n51:14.720 --> 51:21.920\n moved out and become more common. And he built a large observatory on the top of his brewery,\n\n51:21.920 --> 51:32.080\n actually. And working with his wife, they used these very elaborately constructed\n\n51:32.080 --> 51:37.600\n grass and metal instruments to make observations of positions of the stars. And he published a whole\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:45.120\n new catalog of where the stars are. And he claimed it was incredibly accurate. He claimed it was so\n\n51:45.120 --> 51:50.560\n accurate that nothing had ever come close to it. Hooke reads this, and he says, wait a minute,\n\n51:51.120 --> 51:56.960\n you didn't use a telescope here of any kind, because what's the point? Unless you do something\n\n51:56.960 --> 52:02.480\n to the telescope, all you see are dots with stars. You just use your eyes. Your eyes can't be that\n\n52:02.480 --> 52:08.000\n good. It's impossible. So what did Hooke do to prove this? He said, what you should have done\n\n52:08.000 --> 52:12.720\n is you should have put a little device in the telescope that lets you measure distances between\n\n52:12.720 --> 52:17.440\n these dots. You didn't do that. And because you didn't, there's no way you could have been that\n\n52:17.440 --> 52:27.200\n good. At two successive meetings of the Royal Society, he hauls the members out into the courtyard\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:34.960\n and he takes a card and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card. And he pastes the\n\n52:34.960 --> 52:42.080\n card up on a wall and he takes them one by one. He says, now move back looking at it, presumably\n\n52:42.080 --> 52:48.960\n with one eye, until you can't tell the black ones from the white stripes. He says, that I can then\n\n52:48.960 --> 52:56.880\n measure the distance. I can see the angles. I can give a number then for what is the best possible,\n\n52:57.360 --> 53:05.280\n what we would call perceptual acuity of human vision. And it turned out, he thought, to be\n\n53:05.280 --> 53:12.560\n something like 10 or more times worse than this guy Hevelius had claimed. So obviously he says,\n\n53:12.560 --> 53:21.120\n Hooke, Hevelius. Well, years ago, I calculated Hevelius's numbers and so on using modern\n\n53:22.080 --> 53:28.000\n tables from NASA and so on. And they are even more accurate than Hevelius claimed. And worse than\n\n53:28.000 --> 53:35.600\n that, the Royal Society sent a young astronomer named Halley over to Dantzig to work with him.\n\n53:35.600 --> 53:41.120\n And Halley writes back and he says, I couldn't believe it, but he taught me how to do it.\n\n53:41.120 --> 53:46.080\n And I could get just as good as he. How is it possible? Well, here, this shows you something\n\n53:46.080 --> 53:52.400\n very interesting about experiments, perception and everything else. Hooke was right, but he was also\n\n53:52.400 --> 53:59.200\n wrong. He was wrong for the right reasons and he was right for the wrong reasons. And what do I\n\n53:59.200 --> 54:09.040\n mean by that? What he actually found was the number for what we now call 2020 vision. He was\n\n54:09.040 --> 54:16.960\n right. You can't tell, except a few people, much better than that. But he was observing the wrong\n\n54:16.960 --> 54:26.720\n thing. What Hevelius was observing was a bright dot, a star, moving past a pointer.\n\n54:28.240 --> 54:34.960\n Our eyes are rather similar to frogs eyes. You know, I'm sure you've heard the story. If I hold\n\n54:34.960 --> 54:41.360\n a dead fly on a string in front of a frog and don't move it, the frog pays no attention. As soon\n\n54:41.360 --> 54:48.960\n as I move the fly, the frog immediately tongue lats out because the visual system of the frog\n\n54:48.960 --> 54:58.160\n responds to motion. So does ours and our acuity for distinguishing motion from statics, five or\n\n54:58.160 --> 55:06.240\n more times better. Yeah, that's fascinating. Damn. And of course, I mean, maybe you can comment on\n\n55:06.240 --> 55:11.040\n their understanding of the human perceptual system at the time. It's probably really terrible.\n\n55:12.080 --> 55:16.800\n Like, yeah, like I've recently been working with just almost as a fun side thing with vision\n\n55:16.800 --> 55:23.200\n scientists and peripheral vision. It's a, it's a beautiful, complex mess. That whole thing,\n\n55:23.200 --> 55:28.480\n we still don't understand all the weird ways that human perception works. And they were probably\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:34.400\n terrible at it. They probably didn't even have any conceptual peripheral vision or anything like\n\n55:34.400 --> 55:40.880\n any conceptual peripheral vision or, or the fovea or, or, I mean, basically anything.\n\n55:41.680 --> 55:46.320\n They had some, I mean, because actually it was Newton himself who probed a lot of this. For\n\n55:46.320 --> 55:53.280\n instance, Newton, the young Newton trying to work his way around what's going on with colors,\n\n55:53.920 --> 56:01.440\n wanted to try and distinguish colors that occur through natural processes out there and colors\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:06.960\n that are a result of our eyes not operating whites. You know what he did? It's a famous thing.\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:13.760\n He took a stick and he stuck that stick under his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball.\n\n56:14.640 --> 56:22.960\n And what that did, what produced colored circles at diametrically opposite positions of the stick\n\n56:22.960 --> 56:27.600\n in the eyeball. And he moved it around to see how they moved, trying to distinguish.\n\n56:27.600 --> 56:32.320\n Legit. Right? I always have to tell my students don't do this, but.\n\n56:34.320 --> 56:40.960\n Or do it if you want to be great and remembered by human history. That's, there's a lot of\n\n56:40.960 --> 56:47.520\n equivalent to sticking a stick into your eye in modern day that may pay off in the end. Okay.\n\n56:51.360 --> 56:55.120\n As a small aside, is the Newton and the Apple story true?\n\n56:55.120 --> 56:57.920\n No. Was it a different fruit?\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:06.560\n As a colleague of mine named Simon Schaffer in England once said on a Nova program that we were\n\n57:06.560 --> 57:12.880\n both on, the role of fruit in the history of science has been vastly exaggerated.\n\n57:13.920 --> 57:19.840\n Okay. So was there any, I mean, to, to the zoom out moments of epiphany,\n\n57:19.840 --> 57:24.480\n is, is there something to moments of epiphany? Oh, again, this is the paradigm shift versus the\n\n57:24.480 --> 57:30.800\n gradualism. There is a shift. It's a much more complex one than that. And we,\n\n57:33.920 --> 57:39.040\n as it happens, a colleague of mine and I are writing a paper right now on one of the aspects\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:44.960\n of these things based on the work that many of our colleagues have done over the last 30 and 40 years.\n\n57:44.960 --> 57:56.320\n Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way. Newton, until the early 1670s and probably\n\n57:56.320 --> 58:03.040\n really until a fair time after that, first of all, was not very interested in questions of motion.\n\n58:03.680 --> 58:09.360\n He was working actually in all chemical relationships or what is called by historians\n\n58:09.360 --> 58:15.600\n chymistry, a kind of early modern chemical structure. Colleagues of ours at Indiana have\n\n58:15.600 --> 58:23.680\n even reproduced the amalgams that, you know, anyway, his way of thinking about motion involved\n\n58:23.680 --> 58:35.120\n a certain set of relationships, which was not conducive to any application of motion.\n\n58:35.120 --> 58:46.000\n Not conducive to any application that would yield computationally direct results for things like\n\n58:46.000 --> 58:54.720\n planetary motions, which he wasn't terribly interested in anyway. He enters a correspondence\n\n58:54.720 --> 59:00.560\n with his original nemesis, Robert Hooke. And Hooke says, well, have you ever thought about,\n\n59:00.560 --> 59:05.440\n and then Hooke tells him a certain way you might think about it. And when Newton hears that,\n\n59:06.800 --> 59:13.120\n he recognizes that there is a way to inject time that would enable him to solve certain problems.\n\n59:14.240 --> 59:21.520\n It's not that there was anything he thought before that was contrary to that way of thinking,\n\n59:21.520 --> 59:28.160\n it's just that that particular technical insight was not something that,\n\n59:28.160 --> 59:34.560\n for a lot of reasons that are complex, had never occurred to him at all. And that sent him a\n\n59:34.560 --> 59:39.760\n different way of thinking. But to answer your question about the Apple business, which is always\n\n59:39.760 --> 59:47.440\n about, you know, gravity and the moon and all of that being, no. The reason there is that the idea\n\n59:48.000 --> 59:55.760\n that what goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth and what goes on at the moon,\n\n59:55.760 --> 1:00:02.800\n at the moon, let us say, remind the sun and the planets, can be due to a direct relationship\n\n1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:13.520\n between the earth, let's say, and the moon, is contrary to fundamental beliefs held by many of\n\n1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:18.720\n the mechanical philosophers, as they're called at the time, in which everything has to involve\n\n1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:26.400\n at least a sequence of direct contacts, has to be something between here and there that's involved.\n\n1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:33.440\n And Hooke, probably not thinking terribly deeply about it, based on what he said,\n\n1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:37.200\n along with others, like the architect and mathematician Christopher Wren,\n\n1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:44.160\n harken back to the notion that, well, maybe there is a kind of magnetic relationship between the\n\n1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:49.600\n moon and maybe the planets and the earth and gravity and so on, vague, but establishing a\n\n1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:56.240\n direct connection somehow, however it's happening, forget about it. Newton wouldn't have cared about\n\n1:00:56.240 --> 1:01:01.120\n that, if that's all they said, but it was when Hooke mentioned this different way of thinking\n\n1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:05.920\n about the motion, a way he could certainly have thought of, because it does not contradict\n\n1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:13.840\n anything. Newton is a brilliant mathematician, and he could see that you could suddenly start\n\n1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:19.840\n to do things with that, that you otherwise wouldn't, and this led eventually to another\n\n1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:24.720\n controversy with Hooke, in which Hooke said, well, after Newton published his Great Principia,\n\n1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.240\n I gave him how to do this. And then Newton, of course, got ticked off about that and said, well,\n\n1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.640\n listen to this, I did everything, and because he had a picayune little idea,\n\n1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:43.040\n he thinks he can take credit for it. Okay. So his ability to play with his ideas mathematically is\n\n1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:48.000\n what solidified the initial intuition that you could have. Was that the first time he was born,\n\n1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.000\n the idea that you have action at a distance, that you can have forces without contact,\n\n1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:02.000\n which is another revolutionary idea? I would say that in the sense of dealing with\n\n1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:14.160\n the mechanics of force like effects considered to act at some distance, it is novel with both\n\n1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:21.200\n Hooke and Newton at the time. The notion that two things might interact at a distance with one\n\n1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:26.240\n another without direct contact, that goes back to antiquity. Only there it would be thought of\n\n1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:35.040\n more as a sympathetic reaction to a magnet and a piece of iron. They have a kind of mutual sympathy\n\n1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:41.520\n for one another. Like what? Love? What are we talking about? Actually, they do sometimes talk\n\n1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:49.040\n like that. That is love. See, now I talk like that all the time. I think love is somehow\n\n1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:58.720\n in consciousness or forces of physics that yet to be discovered. Okay. Now there's the other side\n\n1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:03.760\n of things, which is calculus that you began to talk about. So Newton brought a lot of things\n\n1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:13.040\n to this world. One of them is calculus. What is calculus? And what was Newton's role in bringing\n\n1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:21.200\n it to life? What was it like? What was the story of bringing calculus to this world? Well, since\n\n1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:28.000\n the publication starting many decades ago by Tom Whiteside, who's now deceased, of Newton's\n\n1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:34.640\n mathematical papers, we know a lot about how he was pushing things and how he was developing things.\n\n1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:42.560\n It's a complex question to say what calculus is. Calculus is the set of mathematical techniques\n\n1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:49.840\n that enable you to investigate what we now call functions, mathematical functions,\n\n1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:58.240\n which are continuous. That is, that are not formed out of discrete sets like the counting numbers,\n\n1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:11.520\n for instance. Newton, there were already procedures for solving problems involving\n\n1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:20.080\n such things as finding areas to under curves and tangents to curves by using geometrical structures,\n\n1:04:20.720 --> 1:04:31.520\n but only for certain limited types of curves, if you will. Newton as a young man, we know this is\n\n1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:42.160\n what happened, is looking at a formula which involves an expansion in separate terms, polynomial\n\n1:04:42.160 --> 1:04:48.880\n terms, as we say, for certain functions. I know I don't want to get complicated here about this,\n\n1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:55.920\n and he realizes it could be generalized. And he tries the generalization and that leads him to\n\n1:04:55.920 --> 1:05:03.840\n an expansion formula called the binomial theorem. That enables him to move ahead with the notion\n\n1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:10.960\n that if I take something that has a certain value, and I add a little bit to it, and I use\n\n1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:17.360\n this binomial theorem and expand things out, I can begin to do new things. And the new things that\n\n1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:24.960\n he begins to do leads him to a recognition that the calculations of areas and the calculations\n\n1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:33.920\n of tangents to curves are reciprocal to one another. And the procedures that he develops\n\n1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:43.520\n is a particular form of the calculus in which he considers small increments and then continuous\n\n1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:52.560\n flows and changes of curves and so on. And we have relics of it in physics today, the notation\n\n1:05:52.560 --> 1:05:59.360\n in which you put a dot over a variable indicating the rate of change of the variable. That's\n\n1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:06.400\n Newton's original type of notation. The dot. Yeah, the dot notation.\n\n1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:16.560\n Possibly independently of Newton, because he didn't publish this thing, although he became\n\n1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:24.720\n quite well known as quite a brilliant young man, in part because people heard about his work and\n\n1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:34.320\n so on. When another young man by the name of Gottfried Leibniz visited London and he heard\n\n1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:42.160\n about these things, it is said that he independently develops his form of the calculus,\n\n1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:47.840\n which is actually the form we use today, both in notation and perhaps in certain\n\n1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:56.160\n fundamental ways of thinking. It has remained a controversial point as to where exactly and how\n\n1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:02.400\n much independently Leibniz did it. Leibniz aficionados think and continue to maintain he\n\n1:07:02.400 --> 1:07:08.000\n did it completely independently. Newton, when he became president of the Royal Society, put together\n\n1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:13.520\n a group to go on the attack saying, no, he must have taken everything. We don't know.\n\n1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:23.200\n But I will tell you this. About 25 or so years ago, a scholar who's a professor at Indiana now\n\n1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:31.440\n named Domenico Melli got his hands on a Leibniz manuscript called the Tentamen,\n\n1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:36.720\n which was Leibniz's attempt to produce an alternative to Newton's mechanics.\n\n1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:37.760\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:43.360\n And it comes to some conclusions that you have in Newton's mechanics. Well, he published that,\n\n1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:49.520\n but Melli got the manuscript. And what Melli found out was that Leibniz reverse engineered\n\n1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:55.520\n the Principia and cooked it backwards so that he could get the results he wanted.\n\n1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:59.680\n That was for the mechanics. So that means his mind allows for that kind of thing.\n\n1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:00.240\n Some people.\n\n1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:04.320\n You're breaking some news today. You're starting some whole drama.\n\n1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:08.960\n Some people think so. I think most historians of mathematics do not agree with that.\n\n1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:15.280\n A friend of mine, rather well known physicist, unfortunately, died a couple of years ago named\n\n1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:22.480\n Mike Nowenberg at UC Santa Cruz, had some evidence along those lines. Didn't pass mustard\n\n1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:28.720\n with many of my friends who are historians of math. In fact, I edit with a historian of math,\n\n1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:33.920\n a technical journal, and we were unable to publish it in there because we couldn't get\n\n1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:39.680\n it through any of our colleagues. But I am, I remain suspicious.\n\n1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:47.040\n What is it about those tense relationships and that kind of drama? Einstein doesn't\n\n1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:52.320\n appear to have much of that drama. Nobody claimed, I haven't heard claims that they've,\n\n1:08:53.360 --> 1:09:00.640\n perhaps because it's such crazy ideas, of any of his major inventions, major ideas,\n\n1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:06.560\n being those that are basically, I came up with it first or independently. There's not,\n\n1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.880\n as far as I'm aware, not many people talk about general relativity, especially in those terms.\n\n1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:20.320\n But with Newton, that was the case. I mean, is that just a natural outgrowth of how science works?\n\n1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:25.040\n Is there going to be personalities that, I'm not saying this about Linus, but maybe I am,\n\n1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:35.040\n but there's people who steal ideas for the, because of ego, because of all those kinds of things.\n\n1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:42.400\n I don't think it's all that common, frankly. The Newton book, Leibniz, Contratemps and so on.\n\n1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:48.240\n Well, you're at the beginnings of a lot of things there and so on. These are difficult\n\n1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:57.920\n and complex times as well. These are times in which science as an activity pursued by other than,\n\n1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:05.440\n let us say, interested aristocrats is becoming something somewhat different. It's not\n\n1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:12.000\n a professional community of investigators in the same way. It's also a period in which\n\n1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:23.120\n procedures and rules or practice are being developed to avoid attacking one another directly\n\n1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:28.240\n and pulling out a sword to cut off the other guy's head if he disagrees with you and so on.\n\n1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:35.440\n So it's a very different period. Controversies happen. People get angry. I can think of a number\n\n1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:42.560\n of others, including in the development of optics in the 19th century and so on, and it can get hot\n\n1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:50.640\n under the collar. Sometimes one character who's worked an area extensively, whether they've come\n\n1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:57.840\n up with something terribly novel or not, and somebody else kind of moves in and does completely\n\n1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:03.840\n different and novel things, the first guy gets upset about it because he's sort of muscled into\n\n1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:10.240\n what I thought was my area. You find that sort of stuff. But do you have examples of cases where it\n\n1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:16.240\n worked out well, like that competition is good for the progress of science? Yeah, it almost always is\n\n1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:21.520\n good in that sense. It's just painful for the individuals involved. It can be. It doesn't have\n\n1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:28.880\n to be nasty, although sometimes it is. So for the example with optics, could you comment on that one?\n\n1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:36.720\n Well, yeah, sure. There are several, but I could give you... All right, so I'll give you this\n\n1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:49.280\n example that probably is the most pertinent. The first polytechnic school like MIT or Caltech was\n\n1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:53.760\n actually founded in France during the French Revolution. It exists today. It's the Ecole\n\n1:11:53.760 --> 1:12:06.160\n Polytechnique. Two people who were there were two young men in the 90s, 1790s named on the one hand\n\n1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:13.040\n Francois Arago and the other Jean Baptiste Biot. They both lived a long time, well into the 1850s.\n\n1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:22.160\n Arago became a major administrator of science and Biot's career started to peter out after about the\n\n1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:30.880\n late teens. Now, they are sent on an expedition, which was one of the expeditions involving\n\n1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:36.320\n measuring things to start the metric system. There's a lot more to that story. Anyway,\n\n1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:46.560\n they come back. Arago gets separated. He's captured by pirates actually. Wounds up in\n\n1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:55.440\n Tangier, escapes, is captured again. Everybody thinks he's dead. He gets back to Paris and so on.\n\n1:12:55.440 --> 1:13:00.640\n He's greeted as a hero and whatnot. In the meantime, Biot has pretty much published some\n\n1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:05.680\n of the stuff that he's done and Arago doesn't get much credit for it and Arago starts to get very\n\n1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:17.920\n angry and Biot is known for this kind of thing. Biot starts investigating a new phenomenon in\n\n1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:24.160\n optics involving something called polarization and he writes all kinds of stuff on it. Arago\n\n1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:33.040\n looks into this and decides to write some things as well and actually Biot gets mostly interested\n\n1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.880\n in it when he finds out that Arago is doing stuff. Now, Biot is actually the better scientist\n\n1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:46.800\n in a lot of ways, but Arago is furious about this. So furious that he actually demands and\n\n1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:57.360\n forces the leader of French science, Laplace, the Marquis de Laplace and cohorts to write a note in\n\n1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:05.760\n the published journal saying, oh, excuse us, actually Arago, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah.\n\n1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:16.080\n So Arago continues to just hold this antipathy and fear of Biot. So what happens? 1815,\n\n1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:24.240\n Napoleon is finished at Waterloo. A young Frenchman by the name of Augustin Fresnel\n\n1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:31.040\n who was in the army is going back to his home on the north coast of France in Normandy,\n\n1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:39.360\n passes through Paris. Arago is friends with Fresnel's uncle who's the head of the \u00c9cole des\n\n1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:45.680\n Beaux Arts at the time. Anyway, Fresnel is already interested in certain things in light\n\n1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:51.200\n and he talks to Arago. Arago tells him a few things. Fresnel goes home and Fresnel is a\n\n1:14:51.200 --> 1:15:00.080\n brilliant experimenter. He observes things and he's a very good mathematician, calculates things,\n\n1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:05.520\n he writes something up, he sends it to Arago. Arago looks at it and Arago says to himself,\n\n1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:12.560\n I can use this to get back at Biot. He brings Fresnel to Paris, sets him up in\n\n1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:19.680\n a room at the observatory where Arago is for Fresnel to continue his work. Paper after paper\n\n1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:31.200\n comes out undercutting everything Biot had done. What is it about jealousy and just envy that\n\n1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:39.280\n could be an engine of creativity and productivity versus like an Einstein where it seems like not?\n\n1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.480\n I don't know which one is better. I guess it depends on the personality. Both are useful\n\n1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:51.280\n engines in science. Well, in this particular story, it's maybe even more interesting because\n\n1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:57.440\n Fresnel himself, the young guy, he knew what Arago was doing with him and he didn't like it.\n\n1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.120\n He didn't want to get with, he wrote his brother said, I don't want to get in an argument with Biot,\n\n1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:10.000\n I just want to do my stuff. Arago is using him, but it's because Arago kept pushing him to go\n\n1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:20.480\n into certain areas that stuff kept coming out. Yeah. Ego is beautiful. Okay. But back to Newton,\n\n1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:26.160\n there's a bunch of things I want to ask, but sort of, let's say since we're on the Leibniz\n\n1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:31.760\n and the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question. Why was Newton a complicated man?\n\n1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:41.760\n We're breaking news today. This is like. Right. Why was he complicated? His\n\n1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:47.120\n brain structure was different. I don't know why. He had a complicated young life, as we've said.\n\n1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:56.720\n He had always been very self contained and solitary. He had acquaintances and friends.\n\n1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:02.560\n And when he moved to London eventually, he had quite a career. A career, for instance, that led\n\n1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:10.560\n him when he was famous by then, the 1690s, he moves to London. He becomes first warden of the\n\n1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:15.520\n mint. The mint is what produces coins and coinage was a complicated thing because there was\n\n1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:23.360\n counterfeiting going on. And he becomes master of the mint to the extent. And a guy at MIT wrote a\n\n1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:30.480\n book about this a little bit. We wrote something on it too. I forget his name was Levin. That Newton\n\n1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:36.640\n sent investigators out to catch these guys and sent at least one of them, a famous one named\n\n1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:47.280\n Challener to the gallows. And one of the reasons he probably was so particularly angry at Challener\n\n1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:52.800\n was Challener had apparently said some nasty things about Newton in front of parliament at\n\n1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:58.800\n some point. Fair enough. That was apparently not a good idea. Well, he had a bit of a temper. So\n\n1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:08.560\n you had a bit of a temper. Clearly. But he even as a young man at Cambridge, though he doesn't come\n\n1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:16.800\n from wealth, he attracts people who recognize his smarts. There's a young fellow named Humphrey\n\n1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:23.680\n Newton shared his rooms. These students always shared rooms with one another, became his kind\n\n1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:34.240\n of amanuensis to write down what Newton was doing and so on. And there were others over time who he\n\n1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:42.880\n befriended in various ways and so on. He was solitary. He had, as far as we know, no relationships\n\n1:18:42.880 --> 1:18:49.360\n with either women or men in anything other than a formal way. The only...\n\n1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:51.360\n Those get in the way relationships.\n\n1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:58.320\n Right. Well, I mean, I don't know if he was close to his mother. I mean, she passed away,\n\n1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:04.160\n everything left him. He went to be with her after she died. He was close to his niece,\n\n1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:13.200\n Catherine Barton, who basically came to run his household when he moved to London and so on. And\n\n1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:21.120\n she married a man named Conduit, who became one of the people who controlled Newton's legacy\n\n1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:29.840\n later on and so on. And you can even see the townhouse that Newton lived in, in those days,\n\n1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:30.400\n still there.\n\n1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:37.120\n All right. So there's the story of Newton coming up with quite a few ideas during a pandemic.\n\n1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:42.640\n We're on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves.\n\n1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:43.040\n Right.\n\n1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.360\n And a lot of people use that example as motivation for everybody while they're\n\n1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:52.560\n in lockdown to get stuff done. So what's that about? Can you tell the story of that?\n\n1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:58.080\n Well, I can. Let me first say that, of course, we've been teaching over Zoom lately.\n\n1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:00.080\n There was no Zoom back then?\n\n1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:04.480\n There was no Zoom back then. Although it wouldn't have made much difference because the story was\n\n1:20:04.480 --> 1:20:09.920\n Newton was so complicated in his lectures that at one point, Humphrey Newton actually said that\n\n1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:12.720\n he might as well have just been lecturing to the walls because nobody was there\n\n1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:15.680\n to listen to it. So what difference?\n\n1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:17.600\n Also not a great teacher, huh?\n\n1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:22.960\n If you look at his optical notes, if that's what he's reading from...\n\n1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:23.840\n Oh, boy. Okay.\n\n1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:27.920\n No.\n\n1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:35.120\n So what can you say about that whole journey through the pandemic that resulted in so much\n\n1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:37.440\n innovation in such a short amount of time?\n\n1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:45.280\n Well, I mean, there's two times that he goes home. Would he have been able to do it and do do it if\n\n1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:50.640\n he'd stayed at Cambridge? I think he would have. I don't think it really... Although I do like to\n\n1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:55.520\n tell my advanced students when I lecture on the history of physics to the physics and chemistry\n\n1:20:55.520 --> 1:21:00.560\n students, especially we've been doing it over Zoom last year, when we get to Newton and so on,\n\n1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:06.400\n because these kids are, you know, 21, 22, I like to say, well, you know, when Newton was your age\n\n1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:11.200\n and he had to go home during an epidemic, do you know what he produced?\n\n1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:16.320\n So can you actually summarize this for people who don't know how old was Newton and what did\n\n1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:23.520\n he produce? Well, Newton goes up to Cambridge, as it said, when he's 18 years old in 1660.\n\n1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:32.080\n And the so called miraculous year, the annus mirabilis, where you get the development\n\n1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:40.000\n in the calculus and in optical discoveries, especially, is 1666, right? So he's, what,\n\n1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:48.400\n 24 years old at the time. But judging from the notebooks that I mentioned, he's already,\n\n1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:55.200\n before that, come to an awful lot of developments over the previous couple of years.\n\n1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:03.280\n Does it have much to do with the fact that he twice went home? It is true that the optical\n\n1:22:03.280 --> 1:22:08.400\n experiments that we talked of a while ago with the light on the wall moving up and down were done at\n\n1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:14.560\n home. In fact, you can visit the very room he did it in to this day. Yeah, it's very cool.\n\n1:22:15.120 --> 1:22:21.280\n And if you look through the window in that room, there is an apple tree out there in the garden.\n\n1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:25.600\n So you might be wrong about this. You're lying to me. Maybe there's an apple\n\n1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:29.760\n involved after all. Well, it's not the same apple tree, but it's cuttings.\n\n1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:30.320\n How do you know?\n\n1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:34.560\n They don't last that long, but it's 400 years ago.\n\n1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:43.040\n Oh, wow. I continue with the dumbest questions. Okay. So you're saying that perhaps going home\n\n1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:50.160\n was not... It may have given him an opportunity to work things through. And after all, he did make\n\n1:22:50.160 --> 1:22:55.520\n use of that room and he could do things like put a shade over the window, move things around,\n\n1:22:55.520 --> 1:23:03.120\n cut holes in it and do stuff. Probably in his rooms at Cambridge, maybe not. Although when he\n\n1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:10.960\n stayed at Cambridge subsequently and became a fellow, and then the second Lucasian professor\n\n1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:18.080\n there, he was actually really the first one because Isaac Barrow, who was the mathematician,\n\n1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:23.440\n professor of optics who recognized Newton's genius, gave up what would have been his position\n\n1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:30.000\n because he recognized... Newton may not have learned too much from him, although they did\n\n1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:35.920\n interact. And so Newton was the first Lucasian professor really, the one that Stephen Hawking\n\n1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:44.480\n held till he died. And we know that the rooms that he had there at Cambridge subsequently,\n\n1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:49.360\n those rooms are still there, he built an all chemical furnace outside, did all sorts of stuff\n\n1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:57.280\n in those rooms. And don't forget, you didn't have to do too much as a Lucasian professor.\n\n1:23:57.280 --> 1:24:01.840\n Every so often you had to go give these lectures, whether anybody was there or not,\n\n1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:08.320\n and deposit the notes for the future, which is how we have all those things.\n\n1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.280\n Oh, they were stored and now we have them. And now we know just how terrible of a teacher Newton\n\n1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:20.560\n was. Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are. In fact, the second volume of Newton's,\n\n1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:27.920\n of the notes really on the great book that he published, The Optics, which he published in 1704,\n\n1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:35.920\n that has just been finished with full annotations and analysis by the greatest analyst of Newton's\n\n1:24:35.920 --> 1:24:42.080\n optics, Alan Shapiro, who retired a few years ago at the University of Minnesota and been working\n\n1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:48.880\n on Newton's optics ever since I knew him and before, and I've known him since 1976.\n\n1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:57.760\n Is there something you could say broadly about either that work on optics or Principia itself\n\n1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:02.720\n as something that I've never actually looked at as a piece of work?\n\n1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:12.400\n Is it powerful in itself or is it just an important moment in history in terms of the\n\n1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:19.280\n amount of inventions that are within, the amount of ideas that are within, or is it a really powerful\n\n1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:27.680\n work in itself? Well, it is a powerful work in itself. You can see this guy coming to grips with\n\n1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:34.880\n and pushing through and working his way around complicated and difficult issues, melding\n\n1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:42.400\n experimental situations which nobody had worked with before, even discovering new things,\n\n1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.320\n trying to figure out ways of putting this together with mathematical structures,\n\n1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:50.720\n succeeding and failing at the same time. And we can see him doing that.\n\n1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:58.640\n I mean, what is, what is contained within Principia? I don't even know in terms of the\n\n1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:04.240\n scope of the work. Is it the entirety of the body of work of Newton?\n\n1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:06.720\n No, no, no, no. The Principia Mathematica...\n\n1:26:06.720 --> 1:26:07.440\n Is it calculus?\n\n1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:14.800\n Well, all right. So the Principia is divided into three books.\n\n1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:15.300\n Excellent.\n\n1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:23.440\n Book one contains his version of the laws of motion and the application of those laws\n\n1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:30.320\n to figure out when a body moves in certain curves and is forced to move in those curves\n\n1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:37.680\n by forces directed to certain fixed points, what is the nature of the mathematical formula\n\n1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:44.240\n for those forces? That's all that book one is about. And it contains not the kind of version\n\n1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:50.080\n of the calculus that uses algebra of the sort that I was trying to explain before,\n\n1:26:50.080 --> 1:27:00.960\n but is done in terms of ratios between geometric line segments when one of the line segments goes\n\n1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:08.320\n very, very small. It's called the kind of limiting procedure, which is calculus, but it's a geometrically\n\n1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:14.960\n structured, although it's clearly got algebraic elements in it as well. And that makes the\n\n1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:21.680\n Principia's mathematical structure rather hard for people who aren't studying it today to\n\n1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:32.720\n go back to. Book two contains his work on what we now call hydrostatics and a little bit about\n\n1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:42.880\n hydrodynamics, a fuller development of the concept of pressure, which is a complicated concept.\n\n1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:51.120\n And book three applies what he did in book one to the solar system. And it is successful\n\n1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:59.920\n partially because the only way that you can exactly solve, the only types of problems you\n\n1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:08.320\n can exactly solve in terms of the interactions of two particles governed by gravitational force\n\n1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:15.440\n between them is for only two bodies. If there's more than two, let's say it's A, B, and C,\n\n1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:24.160\n A acts on B, B acts on C, C acts on A, you cannot solve it exactly. You have to develop techniques.\n\n1:28:24.160 --> 1:28:29.840\n The fullest sets of techniques are really only developed about 30 or 40 years after Newton's\n\n1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:39.360\n death by French mathematicians like Laplace. Newton tried to apply his structure to the\n\n1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:46.160\n sun, earth, moon, because the moon's motion is very complicated. The moon, for instance,\n\n1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:53.520\n exactly repeats its observable position among the stars only every 19 years.\n\n1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:59.280\n That is, if you look up where the moon is among the stars at certain times and it changes,\n\n1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:05.840\n it's complicated. That's, by the way, that was discovered by the Babylonians.\n\n1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:08.320\n That fact, the 19 years.\n\n1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:09.840\n Thousands of years ago, yes.\n\n1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:13.680\n And then you have to load that little piece of data and how do you make sense of it? I mean,\n\n1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:15.280\n that is data and you have to fit it.\n\n1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:21.920\n And it's complicated. So Newton actually kind of reverse engineered a technique that had been\n\n1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:28.480\n developed by a man named Horrocks, using certain laws of Kepler's to try and get around this thing.\n\n1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:32.800\n And Newton then sort of, my understanding, I've never studied this, has reversed,\n\n1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:39.280\n sort of reversed it and fit it together with his force calculations by way of an approximation.\n\n1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:45.120\n And was able to construct a model to make some predictions?\n\n1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:49.680\n It fit things backwards pretty well.\n\n1:29:49.680 --> 1:29:55.360\n Okay. Where does data fit into this? We kind of earlier in the discussion\n\n1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:04.560\n mentioned data as part of the scientific method. How important was data to Newton?\n\n1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:05.440\n Okay.\n\n1:30:05.440 --> 1:30:11.120\n So like you mentioned Prism and playing with it and looking at stuff and then coming up with\n\n1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:14.720\n calculations and so on. Where does data fit into any of his ideas?\n\n1:30:14.720 --> 1:30:20.800\n All right. Well, let me say two things first. One, we rarely use the phrase scientific method\n\n1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:28.880\n anymore because there is no one easily describable such method. I mean, humans have been\n\n1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:34.160\n playing around with the world and learning how to repetitively do things and make things happen\n\n1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:37.200\n ever since, you know, humans became humans.\n\n1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:41.280\n Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method?\n\n1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:45.840\n Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method? What are the various?\n\n1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:49.280\n No, I don't. I prefer to talk about\n\n1:30:52.880 --> 1:31:01.040\n the considered manipulation of artificial structures to produce results that can be\n\n1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:08.160\n worked together with schemes to construct other devices and make\n\n1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:11.360\n predictions, if you will, about the way such things will work.\n\n1:31:11.360 --> 1:31:16.080\n So ultimately, it's about producing other devices. It's like leads you down a...\n\n1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:22.720\n I think so, principally. I mean, you may have data, if you will, like astronomical data\n\n1:31:23.280 --> 1:31:30.640\n obtained otherwise and so on, but yes. But number two here is this question of data. What is data\n\n1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:38.800\n in that sense? See, when we talk about data today, we have a kind of complex notion, which\n\n1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:47.920\n reverts to even issues of statistics and measurement procedures and so on. So let me put it to you this\n\n1:31:47.920 --> 1:31:55.760\n way. So let's say I had a ruler in front of me and it's marked off in little black marks separated\n\n1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:03.280\n by, let's say, distances called a millimeter. Okay. Now I make a mark on this piece of paper here.\n\n1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:09.920\n So I made a nice black mark, right? Nice black mark. And I ask you, I want you to measure that\n\n1:32:09.920 --> 1:32:15.840\n and tell me how long it is. You're going to take the ruler, you're going to put it next to it,\n\n1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:24.320\n and you're going to look, and it's not going to sit, even if you put one end in the middle,\n\n1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:29.680\n even if you put one end as close as you can on one black mark, the other end probably isn't going to\n\n1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:35.440\n be exactly on a black mark. Well, you'll say it's closer to this or that. You'll write down a number\n\n1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:40.160\n and I say, okay, take the ruler away a minute. I take this away, come back in five minutes,\n\n1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:44.480\n put the piece of paper down, do it again. You're going to probably come up with a different number\n\n1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:50.000\n and you're going to do that a lot of times. And then if I tell you, I want you to give me your\n\n1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:54.640\n best estimate of what the actual length of that thing is, what are you going to do?\n\n1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:00.080\n You're going to average all of these numbers. Why?\n\n1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:05.280\n Statistics.\n\n1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:10.800\n Well, yes, statistics. There's lots of ways of going around it,\n\n1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:16.720\n but the average is the best estimate on the basis of what's called the central limit theorem,\n\n1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:23.840\n a statistical theorem. We're talking about things that were not really developed until the 1750s,\n\n1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:26.880\n 60s and 70s. Newton died in 1727.\n\n1:33:26.880 --> 1:33:28.800\n The intuition perhaps was there.\n\n1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:33.440\n Not really. I'll tell you what people did, including Newton, although Newton is\n\n1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:38.240\n partially the one exception. We talked a while ago about this guy, Christian Huygens.\n\n1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:45.680\n He measured lots of things and he was a good mechanic himself. He and his brother ground\n\n1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.680\n lenses. Huygens, I told you, developed the first pendulum mechanism, pendulum driven clock with a\n\n1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:58.080\n mechanism and so on. Also a spring watch where he got into a controversy with Hooke over that,\n\n1:33:58.080 --> 1:33:58.640\n by the way.\n\n1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:02.800\n What's with these mechanics and the controversy?\n\n1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:12.960\n Well, we also have Huygens's notes. They're preserved at Leiden University in Holland,\n\n1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:18.960\n he's Dutch, for his work in optics, which was extensive. We don't have time to go into that,\n\n1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:23.920\n except the following. A number of years ago, I went through those things because\n\n1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:30.480\n in this optical theory that he had, there are four numbers that you've got to be able to get\n\n1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:37.360\n good numbers on to be able to predict other things. What would we do today? What in fact\n\n1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:42.480\n was done at the end of the 18th century when somebody went back to this? I told you to do\n\n1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:48.240\n with the ruler. You make a lot of measurements and average results. We have Huygens's notes.\n\n1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:56.240\n He did make a lot of measurements, one after the other, after the other. But when he came to use\n\n1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:01.920\n the numbers for calculations, and indeed when he published things at the end of his life,\n\n1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:09.360\n he gives you one number and it's not the average of any of them. It's just one of them. Which one\n\n1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:20.080\n was it? The one that he thought he got so good at working by practice that he put down the one he\n\n1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:26.880\n was most confident in. That was the general procedure at the time. You wouldn't publish\n\n1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:32.320\n a paper in which you wrote down six numbers and said, well, I measured this six times.\n\n1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:37.360\n Let me put them together. None of them is really, they would have said, the right number,\n\n1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:42.240\n but I'll put them together and give you a good number. No, you would have been thought of that,\n\n1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:49.440\n you know, you don't know what you're doing. Yeah. By the way, there's just an inkling of value to\n\n1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:56.800\n that approach. Just an inkling. We sometimes use statistics as like a thing that like, oh,\n\n1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:01.760\n that solves all the problems. We'll just do a lot of it and we'll take the average or whatever it\n\n1:36:01.760 --> 1:36:08.640\n is. As many excellent books on mathematics have highlighted the flaws in our approach to certain\n\n1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:16.800\n sciences that rely heavily on statistics. Okay. Let me ask you again for a friend about this\n\n1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:24.160\n alchemy thing. You know, it'd be nice to create gold, but it also seems to come into play quite\n\n1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:30.320\n a bit throughout the history of science, perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact. Can you\n\n1:36:30.320 --> 1:36:40.480\n say something to the history of alchemy? A little bit. Sure. It used to be thought two things. One,\n\n1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:48.080\n that alchemy, which dates certainly back to the Islamic period in Islam, you're talking, you know,\n\n1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:54.720\n 11th, 12th, 13th centuries among Islamic natural philosophers and experimenters.\n\n1:36:54.720 --> 1:37:03.360\n But it used to be thought that alchemy, which picked up strikingly in the 16th century, 1500s\n\n1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:12.080\n and thereabouts, was a sort of mystical procedure involving all sorts of strange notions and so on.\n\n1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:20.240\n And that's not entirely untrue, but it is substantially untrue in that alchemists were\n\n1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:32.480\n engaged in what was known as chrysopoeia, that is looking for ways to transform invaluable materials\n\n1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:42.000\n into valuable ones. But in the process of doing so or attempting to do so, they learned how to\n\n1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:49.920\n create complex amalgams of various kinds. They used very elaborate apparatus, glass\n\n1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:57.360\n alembics in which they would use heat to produce chemical decompositions. They would write down and\n\n1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:03.840\n observe these compositions. And many of the so called really strange looking alchemical formulas\n\n1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.360\n and statements where they'll say something like, I can't produce it, but it'll be the soul of\n\n1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:18.720\n Mars will combine with this, et cetera, et cetera. These, it has been shown, are almost all actual\n\n1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:26.960\n formulas for how to engage in the production of complex amalgams and what to do. And by the time\n\n1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:34.960\n of Newton, Newton was reading the works of a fellow by the name of Starkey, who actually came\n\n1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:45.360\n from Harvard shortly before, in which things had progressed, if you will, to the point where\n\n1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:52.640\n the procedure turns into what historians call chrysopoeia, which basically runs into the notion\n\n1:38:52.640 --> 1:39:00.000\n of thinking that these things are made out of particles. This is the mechanical philosophy.\n\n1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:06.800\n This is the mechanical philosophy. Can we engage in processes, chemical processes to rearrange these\n\n1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:12.800\n things, which is not so stupid after all. I mean, we do it, except we happen to do it in reactors,\n\n1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:18.560\n not in chemical processes, unless of course it had happened that cold fusion had worked,\n\n1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:26.240\n which it didn't. Not yet. Well, right. So that's the way they're thinking about these things.\n\n1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:32.320\n There's a kind of mix. And Newton engages extensively in those sorts of manipulations.\n\n1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:41.360\n In fact, more in that than almost anything else, except for his optical investigations. If you look\n\n1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:47.440\n through the latter parts of the 1670s, the last five, six, seven years or so of that,\n\n1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:53.280\n there's more on that than there is on anything else. He's not working on mechanics. He's pretty\n\n1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:59.760\n much gone pretty far in optics. He'll turn back to optics later on. So optics and alchemy.\n\n1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:07.360\n So what you're saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things. Well, actually, if you go online and look\n\n1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:13.680\n at what Bill Newman, the professor at Indiana, at Bloomington, Indiana has produced, you'll find\n\n1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.760\n the very shiny thing called the star regulus, which Newton describes as having produced according to\n\n1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:24.960\n a particular way, which Newman figured out and was able to do it. And it's very shiny.\n\n1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:33.280\n There you go. Proves the theorem. Can I ask you about God, religion and its role in Newton's life?\n\n1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:47.120\n Was there helpful, constructive or destructive influences of religion in his work and in his life?\n\n1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:55.520\n Well, there you begin to touch on a complex question. The role that God played would be an\n\n1:40:55.520 --> 1:41:00.400\n interesting question to answer should one go and be able to speak with this invisible character\n\n1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:05.200\n who doesn't exist. But putting that aside for the moment. Yeah, we don't like to talk about others\n\n1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:12.560\n while they're not here. So, right. Newton is a deeply religious man, not unusually so,\n\n1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:24.400\n of course, for the time. And clearly, his upbringing and perhaps his early experiences\n\n1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:32.080\n have exacerbated that in a number of ways that he takes a lot of things personally. And he finds\n\n1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:43.280\n perhaps solace in thinking about a sort of governing, abstract, rulemaking, exacting deity.\n\n1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:56.160\n I think there is little question that his conviction that you can figure things out has\n\n1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:05.360\n a fair bit to do with his profound belief that this rulemaker doesn't do things arbitrarily.\n\n1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:14.080\n Newton does not think that miracles have happened since maybe the time of Christ, if then,\n\n1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:20.000\n and not in the same way. He was, for instance, an anti Trinitarian. He did not hold that Christ\n\n1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:26.960\n had a divine being, but was rather endowed with certain powers by the rulemaker and whatnot.\n\n1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:38.720\n And he did not think that some of the tales of the Old Testament with various miracles and so on\n\n1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:44.720\n occurred in anything like that way. Some may have, some may not have. Like everybody else,\n\n1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:51.200\n of course, he did think that creation had happened about 6,000 years ago. Wait, really? Oh, yeah,\n\n1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:56.640\n sure. Well, biblical chronology can give you a little bit about that. It's a little controversial,\n\n1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:06.320\n but sure. Interesting. Wow. The deity created the universe 6,000 years ago. And that didn't\n\n1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:12.480\n interfere with his playing around with the sun and the moon? No, because he's figuring out,\n\n1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:20.720\n he's watching the brilliant construction that this perfect entity did 6,000 years ago.\n\n1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:27.760\n Yeah, has produced. Plus or minus a few years. Well, if you go with Bishop Boster, it's 4004 BCE.\n\n1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:36.080\n Want to be precise about it. We always, and this is a serious program, we always want to be precise.\n\n1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:44.480\n Okay. Let me ask another ridiculous question. If Newton were to travel forward in time\n\n1:43:45.440 --> 1:43:54.880\n and visit with Einstein and have a discussion about space time and general relativity,\n\n1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:59.600\n that conception of time and that conception of gravity, what do you think that discussion will go\n\n1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:07.120\n like? Put that way, I think Newton would sit there in shock and say, I have no idea what you're\n\n1:44:07.120 --> 1:44:13.440\n talking about. If on the other hand, there's a time machine, you go back and bring a somewhat\n\n1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:21.600\n younger Newton, not a man my age, say. I mean, he lived a long time into his mid eighties,\n\n1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:27.280\n but take him when he's in his forties, let's say, bring him forward and don't immediately\n\n1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:33.760\n introduce him to Einstein. Let's take him for a ride on a railroad. Let him experience the\n\n1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:45.920\n railroad. Oh, that's right. Take him around and show him a sparking machine. He knows about sparks,\n\n1:44:45.920 --> 1:44:52.320\n sending off sparks. Show him wires, have him touch the wires and get a little shock.\n\n1:44:52.320 --> 1:45:01.600\n Show him a clicking telegraph machine of the kind. Then let him hear the clicks in a telephone\n\n1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.200\n receiver and so on. Do that for a couple of months. Let him get accustomed to things.\n\n1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:14.880\n Then take him into, not Einstein yet, let's say we're taking him into the 1890s. Einstein is\n\n1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:21.040\n young man then. We take him into some of the laboratories. We show him some of the equipment,\n\n1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.880\n the devices, not the most elaborate ones. We show him certain things. We educate him\n\n1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:32.960\n bit by bit. On optics, maybe focus on that. Certainly on optics. You begin to show him\n\n1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:40.640\n things. He's a brilliant human being. I think bit by bit, he would begin to see what's going on.\n\n1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.640\n But if you just dumped him in front of Einstein, he'd sit there, his eyes would glaze over.\n\n1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:57.760\n I mean, I guess it's almost a question of how big of a leap, how many leaps have been taken\n\n1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:02.960\n in science that go from Newton to Einstein. We sometimes in a compressed version of history\n\n1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:13.200\n think that not much. Oh, that's totally wrong. A lot. Huge amounts in multifarious ways\n\n1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:19.360\n involving fundamental conceptions, mathematical structures, the evolution of novel experimentation\n\n1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:25.600\n and devices, the organization. It's not everything. Everything. I mean, to a point where I wonder\n\n1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:35.120\n even if Newton was like, you said 40, but even like 30. So he's very, like if you would be able\n\n1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:42.080\n to catch up with the conception of everything. I wonder as a scientist, how much you load in from\n\n1:46:42.080 --> 1:46:50.400\n age five about this world in order to be able to conceive of the world of ideas that push that\n\n1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:56.480\n science forward. I mean, you mentioned the railroad and all those kinds of things. That might be\n\n1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:02.000\n fundamental to our ability to invent even when it doesn't directly obviously seem relevant.\n\n1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:13.840\n Well, yes. I mean, the railroad, the steam engine, the Watt engine, et cetera. I mean,\n\n1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:19.440\n that was really the Watt engine was developed pretty... Although Watt knew Joseph Black,\n\n1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:25.200\n a chemist scientist and so on, did stuff on heat, was developed pretty much independently of\n\n1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:36.560\n the developing thoughts about heat at the time. But what it's not independent of is the evolution\n\n1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:45.200\n of practice in the manufacture and construction of devices which can do things in extraordinarily\n\n1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:51.600\n novel ways and the premium being gradually placed on calculating how you can make them more\n\n1:47:51.600 --> 1:48:00.320\n efficient. That is of a piece with a way of thinking about the world in which you're controlling\n\n1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:07.040\n things and working it. It's something that humans have been doing for a long time, but in this more\n\n1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:18.160\n concerted and structured way, I think you really don't find it in the fullest sense until well into\n\n1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:28.320\n the 1500s and really not fully until the 17th century later on. So Newton had this year of\n\n1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:34.560\n miracles. I wonder if I could ask you briefly about Einstein and his year of miracles. I've\n\n1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:42.800\n been reading, re reading, revisiting the brilliance of the papers that Einstein published in the year\n\n1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:49.280\n 1905, one of which won him the Nobel prize, the photoelectric effect, but also Brownian motion,\n\n1:48:49.280 --> 1:48:56.320\n special theory of relativity, and of course the old E equals MC squared.\n\n1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.520\n Does that make sense to you that these two figures had such productive years\n\n1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:12.960\n that there's this moment of genius? Maybe, maybe if we zoom out, I mean, I, my work is very much\n\n1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:19.120\n in artificial intelligence, sort of wondering about the nature of intelligence. Like how did we,\n\n1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:28.400\n how did evolution on earth produce genius that could come up with so much in so little time?\n\n1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:35.040\n To me, that gives me hope that one person can change the world in such a small amount of time.\n\n1:49:35.040 --> 1:49:44.720\n Well, of course there are precedents for, in both Newton's and Einstein's cases for elements of\n\n1:49:44.720 --> 1:49:50.000\n what we're finding there. It's, you know, and so on. Well, I have no idea. You know,\n\n1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.880\n I'm sure you must've read, it was a kind of a famous story that after Einstein died,\n\n1:49:54.880 --> 1:50:00.240\n he donated his brain and they sliced it up to see if they could find something unusual there,\n\n1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:10.800\n nothing unusual visibly in there. So I have, clearly there are people who for various reasons,\n\n1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:19.280\n maybe both intrinsic and extrinsic in the sense of experience and so on, are capable of coming\n\n1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:27.280\n up with these extraordinary results. Many years ago, when I was a student, a friend of mine came\n\n1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:31.440\n in and said, did you read about, did you read this? I forget what, anyway, there was a story\n\n1:50:31.440 --> 1:50:43.040\n in the paper. It was about, I think it was a young woman who was, she couldn't speak and she was\n\n1:50:43.040 --> 1:50:53.520\n somewhere on the autism spectrum. She could not read other people's affect in any ways, but she\n\n1:50:53.520 --> 1:51:03.520\n could sit down at a piano and having heard it once and then run variations on the most complex\n\n1:51:05.120 --> 1:51:10.240\n pianistic works of Chopin and others, right? Now how?\n\n1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:21.360\n Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in in some aspect of reality and become a master of it.\n\n1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:25.840\n And every once in a while, that means coming up with breakthrough ideas in physics.\n\n1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:33.520\n Yep. How the heck does that happen? Who knows? Jed, I'd like to say thank you so much for spending\n\n1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:37.680\n your valuable time with me today. It was a really fascinating conversation. I've learned so much\n\n1:51:37.680 --> 1:51:41.760\n about Isaac Newton, who's one of the most fascinating figures in human history. So\n\n1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:44.320\n thank you so much for talking to me. My pleasure. I enjoyed it very much.\n\n1:51:44.320 --> 1:51:51.360\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jed Buchwald. To support this podcast,\n\n1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:56.960\n please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from\n\n1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:03.680\n Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science. The answers you get depend on the questions you ask.\n\n1:52:03.680 --> 1:52:16.800\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
