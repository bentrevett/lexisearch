  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:06.100\n The following is a conversation with Anne Drouin, writer, producer, director, and one\n\n00:06.100 --> 00:10.480\n of the most important and impactful communicators of science in our time.\n\n00:10.480 --> 00:16.960\n She co wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she\n\n00:16.960 --> 00:24.280\n married in 1981 and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brainwaves\n\n00:24.280 --> 00:29.320\n on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched\n\n00:29.320 --> 00:36.320\n into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still\n\n00:36.320 --> 00:43.000\n active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human made object ever has.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:48.800\n This was a profound and beautiful decision Anne made as the creative director of NASA's\n\n00:48.800 --> 00:51.400\n Voyager Interstellar Message Project.\n\n00:51.400 --> 00:58.560\n In 2014 she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos A Space Time Odyssey,\n\n00:58.560 --> 01:05.440\n in 2020 the new third season called Cosmos Possible Worlds, which is being released this\n\n01:05.440 --> 01:07.520\n upcoming Monday, March 9th.\n\n01:07.520 --> 01:14.920\n It is hosted, once again, by the fun and the brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\n01:14.920 --> 01:21.320\n Carl Sagan, Anne Drouin, and Cosmos have inspired millions of scientists and curious minds across\n\n01:21.320 --> 01:27.680\n several generations by revealing the magic, the power, the beauty of science.\n\n01:27.680 --> 01:33.920\n I am one such curious mind, and if you listened to this podcast, you may know that Elon Musk\n\n01:33.920 --> 01:35.480\n is as well.\n\n01:35.480 --> 01:40.400\n He graciously agreed to read Carl Sagan's words about the pale blue dot in my second\n\n01:40.400 --> 01:42.280\n conversation with him.\n\n01:42.280 --> 01:48.280\n If you listened, there was an interesting and inspiring twist at the end.\n\n01:48.280 --> 01:53.160\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast, if you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give\n\n01:53.160 --> 01:58.200\n it 5 stars on Apple Podcast, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at\n\n01:58.200 --> 02:02.360\n Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n02:02.360 --> 02:06.840\n As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that\n\n02:06.840 --> 02:08.960\n can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n02:08.960 --> 02:13.800\n I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n02:13.800 --> 02:18.320\n This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:18.320 --> 02:21.480\n When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.\n\n02:21.480 --> 02:26.040\n Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with\n\n02:26.040 --> 02:28.840\n as little as $1.\n\n02:28.840 --> 02:34.400\n Since Cash App allows you to send and receive money digitally, peer to peer, and security\n\n02:34.400 --> 02:39.600\n in all digital transactions is very important, let me mention the PCI data security standard\n\n02:39.600 --> 02:41.440\n that Cash App is compliant with.\n\n02:41.440 --> 02:45.320\n I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security.\n\n02:45.320 --> 02:50.760\n PCI DSS is a good example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed\n\n02:50.760 --> 02:55.480\n that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.\n\n02:55.480 --> 02:59.820\n Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence systems\n\n02:59.820 --> 03:01.820\n in general.\n\n03:01.820 --> 03:06.200\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play, and use the code LEX\n\n03:06.200 --> 03:13.120\n PODCAST, you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my favorite organizations\n\n03:13.120 --> 03:19.280\n that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world.\n\n03:19.280 --> 03:24.480\n And now, here's my conversation with Anne Drouin.\n\n03:24.480 --> 03:26.960\n What is the role of science in our society?\n\n03:26.960 --> 03:35.800\n Well, I think of what Einstein said when he opened the 1939 New York World's Fair.\n\n03:35.800 --> 03:46.920\n He said, if science is ever to fulfill its mission the way art has done, it must penetrate.\n\n03:46.920 --> 03:53.420\n Its inner meaning must penetrate the consciousness of everyone.\n\n03:53.420 --> 04:00.660\n And so for me, especially in a civilization dependent on high technology and science,\n\n04:00.660 --> 04:12.280\n one that aspires to be democratic, it's critical that the public, as informed decision makers,\n\n04:12.280 --> 04:18.200\n understand the values and the methods and the rules of science.\n\n04:18.200 --> 04:24.360\n So you think about what you just mentioned, the values and the methods and the rules and\n\n04:24.360 --> 04:30.440\n maybe the technology that science produces, but what about sort of the beauty, the mystery\n\n04:30.440 --> 04:31.440\n of science?\n\n04:31.440 --> 04:37.340\n Well, you've touched on what I think is for me, that's how my way into science is that\n\n04:37.340 --> 04:42.160\n for me, it's much more spiritually uplifting.\n\n04:42.160 --> 04:50.320\n The revelations of science, the collective revelations of really countless generations\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:58.280\n of searchers and the little tiny bit we know about reality is the greatest joy for me because\n\n04:58.280 --> 05:02.120\n I think that it relates to the idea of love.\n\n05:02.120 --> 05:07.600\n What is love that is based on illusion about the other?\n\n05:07.600 --> 05:08.600\n That's not love.\n\n05:08.600 --> 05:16.220\n Love is seeing, unflinching the other and accepting with all your heart.\n\n05:16.220 --> 05:21.440\n And to me, knowing the universe as it is, or the little bit that we're able to understand\n\n05:21.440 --> 05:25.380\n at this point is the purest kind of love.\n\n05:25.380 --> 05:32.800\n And therefore, you know, how can our philosophy, our religion, if it's rootless in nature,\n\n05:32.800 --> 05:35.520\n how can it really be true?\n\n05:35.520 --> 05:36.800\n I just don't understand.\n\n05:36.800 --> 05:47.000\n So I think you need science to get a sense of the real romance of life and the great\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.800\n experience of being awake in the cosmos.\n\n05:50.800 --> 05:59.040\n So the fact that we know so little, the humbling nature of that, and you kind of connect love\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:04.560\n to that, but isn't it also, isn't it scary?\n\n06:04.560 --> 06:06.880\n Why is it so inspiring, do you think?\n\n06:06.880 --> 06:10.080\n Why is it so beautiful that we know so little?\n\n06:10.080 --> 06:16.560\n Well, first of all, as Socrates thought, you know, knowing that you know little is knowing,\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:19.760\n really knowing something, knowing more than others.\n\n06:19.760 --> 06:27.200\n And it's that voice whispering in our heads, you know, you might be wrong, which I think\n\n06:27.200 --> 06:32.920\n is not only it's really healthy because we're so imperfect, we're human, of course, but\n\n06:32.920 --> 06:38.960\n also, you know, love to me is the feeling that you always want to go deeper, get closer.\n\n06:38.960 --> 06:41.520\n You can't get enough of it.\n\n06:41.520 --> 06:44.920\n You can't get close enough, deep enough.\n\n06:44.920 --> 06:50.240\n So and that's what science is always saying is science is never simply content with its\n\n06:50.240 --> 06:53.700\n understanding of any aspect of nature.\n\n06:53.700 --> 06:59.760\n It's always saying it's always finding that even smaller cosmos beneath.\n\n06:59.760 --> 07:04.000\n So I think the two are very much parallel.\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:08.680\n So you said that love is not an illusion.\n\n07:08.680 --> 07:09.680\n No, it's not.\n\n07:09.680 --> 07:12.160\n What is love?\n\n07:12.160 --> 07:21.560\n What is love is, is knowing, for me, love is, is knowing something deeply and still\n\n07:21.560 --> 07:28.400\n being completely gratified by it, you know, and wanting to know more.\n\n07:28.400 --> 07:30.240\n So what is love?\n\n07:30.240 --> 07:40.720\n What is loving someone, a person, let's say deeply is not idealizing them, not putting\n\n07:40.720 --> 07:48.880\n some kind of subjective projection on them, but knowing them as they are.\n\n07:48.880 --> 07:55.080\n And so for me, for me, the only aperture to that knowing about nature, the universe is\n\n07:55.080 --> 08:00.520\n science because it has that error correcting mechanism that most of the stuff that we do\n\n08:00.520 --> 08:01.520\n doesn't have.\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:05.800\n You know, you could say the Bill of Rights is kind of an error correcting mechanism,\n\n08:05.800 --> 08:12.080\n which is one of the things I really appreciate about the society in which I live to the extent\n\n08:12.080 --> 08:17.240\n that it's upheld and we keep faith with it and the same with science.\n\n08:17.240 --> 08:25.040\n It's like we will give you the highest rewards we have for proving us wrong about something.\n\n08:25.040 --> 08:27.700\n It's genius.\n\n08:27.700 --> 08:36.640\n That's why, that's why in only 400 years since Galileo's first look through a telescope,\n\n08:36.640 --> 08:46.660\n we could get from this really dim, vague, this vague apprehension of another world to\n\n08:46.660 --> 08:52.440\n sending our eyes and our senses there or even to going beyond.\n\n08:52.440 --> 08:59.860\n So it is, it is, it delivers the goods like nothing else, you know, it really, it delivers\n\n08:59.860 --> 09:06.440\n the goods because it's always, it's always self aware of its fallibility.\n\n09:06.440 --> 09:12.560\n So on that topic, I'd like to ask your opinion and a feeling I have that I'm not sure what\n\n09:12.560 --> 09:18.220\n to do with, which is the, the skeptical aspect of science.\n\n09:18.220 --> 09:24.280\n So the modern skeptics community and just in general, certain scientists, many scientists,\n\n09:24.280 --> 09:30.840\n maybe most scientists that apply the scientific method are kind of rigorous in that application.\n\n09:30.840 --> 09:35.640\n And they, it feels like sometimes miss out some of the ideas outside the reaches, just\n\n09:35.640 --> 09:37.840\n slightly outside of the reach of science.\n\n09:37.840 --> 09:43.220\n And they don't dare to sort of dream or think of revolutionary ideas that others will call\n\n09:43.220 --> 09:45.160\n crazy in this particular moment.\n\n09:45.160 --> 09:50.600\n So how do you think about the skeptical aspect of science that is really good at sort of\n\n09:50.600 --> 09:55.640\n keeping us in check, keeping us humble, but, but at the same time, sort of the kind of\n\n09:55.640 --> 10:01.240\n dreams that you and Carl Sagan have inspired in the world, it kind of shuts it down sometimes\n\n10:01.240 --> 10:02.240\n a little bit.\n\n10:02.240 --> 10:03.240\n Yeah.\n\n10:03.240 --> 10:08.420\n I mean, I think it's up to the individual, but for me, you know, I was so ridiculously\n\n10:08.420 --> 10:14.120\n fortunate in that I, my tutorial in science, because I'm not a scientist and I wasn't trained\n\n10:14.120 --> 10:20.480\n in science, was 20 years of days and nights with Carl Sagan.\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:26.480\n And the wonder, I think the reason Carl remains so beloved, well, I think there are many reasons,\n\n10:26.480 --> 10:33.440\n but at the root of it is the fact that his skepticism was never at the cost of his wonder\n\n10:33.440 --> 10:38.280\n and his wonder was never at the cost of his skepticism.\n\n10:38.280 --> 10:42.640\n So he couldn't fool himself into believing something he wanted to believe because it\n\n10:42.640 --> 10:45.440\n made him feel good at the other.\n\n10:45.440 --> 10:52.640\n But on the other hand, he recognized that what science, what nature is, it's really,\n\n10:52.640 --> 10:57.600\n it's good enough, you know, it's way better than our fantasies.\n\n10:57.600 --> 11:04.560\n And so if you, if you're that kind of person who loves happiness, loves life and your eyes\n\n11:04.560 --> 11:09.560\n are wide open and you read everything you can get your hands on and you spend years\n\n11:09.560 --> 11:18.680\n studying what is known so far about the universe, then you have that capacity, a really infinite\n\n11:18.680 --> 11:27.440\n capacity to be alive, but all, and also at the same time to be very rigorous about what\n\n11:27.440 --> 11:28.920\n you're willing to believe.\n\n11:28.920 --> 11:36.280\n For Carl, I don't think he ever felt that his skepticism cost him anything because again,\n\n11:36.280 --> 11:37.700\n it comes back to love.\n\n11:37.700 --> 11:44.320\n He wanted to know what Nietzsche really was like, not to inflict his, you know, preconceived\n\n11:44.320 --> 11:46.560\n notions on what he wanted it to be.\n\n11:46.560 --> 11:51.720\n So you can't go wrong because it doesn't, you know, I mean, you know, I think the pale\n\n11:51.720 --> 12:01.400\n blue dot is the, is a perfect example of this, of his massive achievement is to say, okay,\n\n12:01.400 --> 12:07.080\n or the Voyager record is another example is here we have this mission, our first reconnaissance\n\n12:07.080 --> 12:09.240\n of the outer solar system.\n\n12:09.240 --> 12:19.320\n Well, how can we make it a mission in which we absolutely squeeze every drop of consciousness\n\n12:19.320 --> 12:21.880\n and understanding from it?\n\n12:21.880 --> 12:25.880\n We don't have to be scientists and then be human beings.\n\n12:25.880 --> 12:33.000\n I think that's the tragedy of Western civilization is that it's, you know, when it's one of its\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:42.600\n greatest gifts has been science and yet at the same time, it believing that we are the\n\n12:42.600 --> 12:50.480\n children of a disappointed father, a tyrant who puts us in a maximum security prison and\n\n12:50.480 --> 12:57.400\n calls it paradise, who looks at us, who watches us every moment and hates us for being our\n\n12:57.400 --> 13:00.080\n human selves, you know?\n\n13:00.080 --> 13:03.040\n And then most of all, what is our great sin?\n\n13:03.040 --> 13:09.500\n It's partaking of the tree of knowledge, which is our greatest gift as humans.\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:17.680\n This pattern recognition, this ability to see things and then synthesize them and jump\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:21.360\n to conclusions about them and test those conclusions.\n\n13:21.360 --> 13:31.480\n So I think the reason that in literature, in movies, the scientist is a figure of alienation,\n\n13:31.480 --> 13:37.600\n a figure, you know, oh, you see these biopics about scientists and yeah, he might've been\n\n13:37.600 --> 13:41.760\n great, but you know, he was missing in ship.\n\n13:41.760 --> 13:44.480\n You know, he was a lousy husband.\n\n13:44.480 --> 13:52.160\n He lacked, you know, the kind of spiritual understanding that maybe, you know, his wife\n\n13:52.160 --> 13:59.040\n had and it's always in the end and they come around, but to me, that's a false dichotomy\n\n13:59.040 --> 14:05.280\n that we are, you know, to the extent that we are aware of our surroundings and understand\n\n14:05.280 --> 14:10.200\n them, which is what science makes it possible for us to do, we're even more alive.\n\n14:10.200 --> 14:16.240\n So you mentioned a million awesome things there, let's even just, can you tell me about\n\n14:16.240 --> 14:22.680\n the Voyager one and two spacecraft and the interstellar message project and that whole\n\n14:22.680 --> 14:24.840\n just fascinating world leading up to.\n\n14:24.840 --> 14:27.480\n One of my favorite subjects, I love talking about it.\n\n14:27.480 --> 14:29.000\n I'll never get over it.\n\n14:29.000 --> 14:35.280\n I'll never be able to really wrap my head around the reality of it, the truth of it.\n\n14:35.280 --> 14:36.280\n What is it first of all?\n\n14:36.280 --> 14:37.280\n What's the Voyager spacecraft?\n\n14:37.280 --> 14:44.640\n Okay, so Voyagers one and two were our first reconnaissance mission of what was then considered\n\n14:44.640 --> 14:49.480\n the outer solar system and it was a gift of gravity.\n\n14:49.480 --> 14:58.360\n The idea that swinging around these worlds gives you a gravitational assist, which ultimately\n\n14:58.360 --> 15:06.520\n will send you out of the solar system to wander the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion\n\n15:06.520 --> 15:08.000\n years.\n\n15:08.000 --> 15:19.320\n So Voyager gave us our first close up look of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.\n\n15:19.320 --> 15:21.760\n It discovered new moons.\n\n15:21.760 --> 15:28.360\n It discovered volcanoes on Io.\n\n15:28.360 --> 15:31.320\n Its achievements are astonishing.\n\n15:31.320 --> 15:37.240\n And remember, this is technology from the early to mid 1970s.\n\n15:37.240 --> 15:38.240\n And it's still active.\n\n15:38.240 --> 15:39.280\n And it's still active.\n\n15:39.280 --> 15:42.340\n We talked to Voyager a few days ago.\n\n15:42.340 --> 15:46.400\n We talked to it, in fact, a year ago, I think it was.\n\n15:46.400 --> 15:50.760\n We needed to slightly change the attitude of the spacecraft.\n\n15:50.760 --> 15:55.680\n And so we fired up its thrusters for the first time since 1987.\n\n15:55.680 --> 15:57.680\n Did they work?\n\n15:57.680 --> 15:58.680\n Instantly.\n\n15:58.680 --> 16:04.040\n It was as if you had left your car in the garage in 1987.\n\n16:04.040 --> 16:09.080\n And you put the key in the ignition because you use keys then in the ignition and it turned\n\n16:09.080 --> 16:12.360\n over the first time you stepped on the gas.\n\n16:12.360 --> 16:17.280\n And so that's the genius of the engineering of Voyager.\n\n16:17.280 --> 16:26.120\n And Carl was one of the key participants in imagining what its mission would be because\n\n16:26.120 --> 16:35.920\n it was a gift actually of the fact that every 175 years, plus or minus, there is an alignment\n\n16:35.920 --> 16:36.920\n of the worlds.\n\n16:36.920 --> 16:44.940\n And so you could send two spacecraft to these other worlds and photograph them and use your\n\n16:44.940 --> 16:54.080\n mass spectrometer and all the other devices on Voyager to really explore these worlds.\n\n16:54.080 --> 17:00.520\n And it's the farthest spacecraft, it's the farthest human creation away from us today.\n\n17:00.520 --> 17:01.520\n Voyager 1.\n\n17:01.520 --> 17:02.520\n Voyager 1.\n\n17:02.520 --> 17:08.920\n These two spacecraft not only gave us our first close up look at hundreds of moons and\n\n17:08.920 --> 17:17.720\n planets, these four giant planets, but also it told us the shape of the solar system as\n\n17:17.720 --> 17:23.400\n it moves through the galaxy because there were two of them going in different directions\n\n17:23.400 --> 17:28.120\n and they finally, and they arrived at a place called the heliopause, which is where the\n\n17:28.120 --> 17:35.080\n wind from the sun, the solar wind dies down and the interstellar medium begins.\n\n17:35.080 --> 17:41.900\n And both Voyagers were the first spacecraft that we had that could tell us when that happened.\n\n17:41.900 --> 17:50.120\n So it's a consummate, I think it's the greatest scientific achievement of the 20th century.\n\n17:50.120 --> 17:51.960\n And engineering in some sense.\n\n17:51.960 --> 17:59.760\n Engineering, I mean really, you know, Voyager is doing this on less energy than you have\n\n17:59.760 --> 18:04.160\n in your toaster, something like 11 Watts.\n\n18:04.160 --> 18:10.440\n So okay, but because of this gravitational assist, both Voyagers were destined, as I\n\n18:10.440 --> 18:16.040\n say, to, first of all, they were supposed to function for a dozen years and now it's\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:20.920\n 42 years since launch and we're still talking to them.\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:22.960\n So that's amazing.\n\n18:22.960 --> 18:31.080\n But prior to launch, almost a year, eight, nine months prior to launch, it was decided\n\n18:31.080 --> 18:36.640\n that since Frank Drake and Carl Sagan and Linda Solzman Sagan had created something\n\n18:36.640 --> 18:44.680\n called the Pioneer 10 Plaque for the Pioneer spacecraft that preceded Voyager, which was\n\n18:44.680 --> 18:50.560\n kind of like a license plate for the planet Earth, you know, man and a woman, hands up,\n\n18:50.560 --> 18:55.920\n you know, very, very basic, but very effective.\n\n18:55.920 --> 18:59.560\n And it captured the imagination of people all over the world.\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:08.760\n And so NASA turned to Frank and to Carl and said, we'd like you to do a message for Voyager\n\n19:08.760 --> 19:16.400\n because if it's going to be circumnavigating the Milky Way galaxy for one to five billion\n\n19:16.400 --> 19:20.640\n years, you know, it's like 20 trips around the galaxy.\n\n19:20.640 --> 19:27.800\n And there's a very small chance that a space faring civilization would be able to flag\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:29.640\n one of them down.\n\n19:29.640 --> 19:37.240\n And so on board, you see this exquisite golden disc with scientific hieroglyphics explaining\n\n19:37.240 --> 19:48.760\n our address and various basic scientific concepts that we believe that would be common to any\n\n19:48.760 --> 19:51.440\n space faring civilization.\n\n19:51.440 --> 20:00.680\n And then beneath this exquisite golden disc is the Voyager record, the golden record.\n\n20:00.680 --> 20:14.640\n And it contains something like 118 photographs, images of life on Earth, as well as 27 pieces\n\n20:14.640 --> 20:19.160\n of music from all around the world.\n\n20:19.160 --> 20:22.560\n Many people describe it as the invention of world music.\n\n20:22.560 --> 20:27.280\n World music was not a concept that existed before the Voyager record.\n\n20:27.280 --> 20:33.080\n And we were determined to take our music, not just from the dominant technical cultures,\n\n20:33.080 --> 20:39.420\n but from all of the rich cultural heritage of the Earth.\n\n20:39.420 --> 20:47.800\n And there's a sound essay, which is a kind of using a microphone as a camera to tell\n\n20:47.800 --> 20:57.280\n the story of the Earth, beginning with its geological sounds and moving into biology\n\n20:57.280 --> 21:00.440\n and then into technology.\n\n21:00.440 --> 21:08.680\n And I think what you were getting at is that at the end of this sound essay, I had asked\n\n21:08.680 --> 21:15.120\n Carl if it were, in the making of the record, it was my honor to be the creative director\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:23.160\n of the project, if it was possible to, if I had meditated for an hour while I was hooked\n\n21:23.160 --> 21:34.460\n up so that every single signal that was coming from my brain, my body, was recorded and then\n\n21:34.460 --> 21:39.000\n converted into sound for the record.\n\n21:39.000 --> 21:44.960\n Was it possible that these putative extraterrestrials of the distant future, of perhaps a billion\n\n21:44.960 --> 21:51.800\n years from now, would be able to reconstitute this message and to understand it?\n\n21:51.800 --> 21:56.160\n And he just, big smile, you know, and just said, well, hey, a billion years is a long\n\n21:56.160 --> 21:57.160\n time.\n\n21:57.160 --> 21:58.160\n It's a long time.\n\n21:58.160 --> 21:59.160\n Go do it.\n\n21:59.160 --> 22:01.200\n And so I did this.\n\n22:01.200 --> 22:03.480\n And what were you thinking about in the meditation?\n\n22:03.480 --> 22:09.160\n Like what, I mean, it's such an interesting idea of recording as you think about things.\n\n22:09.160 --> 22:10.760\n What were you thinking about?\n\n22:10.760 --> 22:17.900\n So I was blindfolded and couldn't hear anything.\n\n22:17.900 --> 22:23.320\n And I had made a mental itinerary of exactly where I wanted to go.\n\n22:23.320 --> 22:33.880\n I was truly humbled by the idea that these thoughts could conceivably touch the distant\n\n22:33.880 --> 22:34.880\n future.\n\n22:34.880 --> 22:35.880\n Yeah, that's incredible.\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:41.600\n So in 1977, there are some 60,000 nuclear weapons on the planet.\n\n22:41.600 --> 22:51.160\n The Soviet Union and the United States are engaged in a, you know, to the death competition.\n\n22:51.160 --> 22:59.240\n And so I began by trying to tell the history of the planet in, you know, to my limited\n\n22:59.240 --> 23:06.760\n ability what I understood about the story of the early existence of the planet, about\n\n23:06.760 --> 23:16.640\n the origin of life, about the evolution of life, about the history of humans, about our\n\n23:16.640 --> 23:25.540\n current at that time predicament, about the fact that one in five of us was starving or\n\n23:25.540 --> 23:29.320\n unable to get potable water.\n\n23:29.320 --> 23:37.200\n And so I sort of gave a kind of, you know, as general a picture as I possibly could of\n\n23:37.200 --> 23:39.520\n our predicament.\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:50.860\n And I also was very newly within days of the moment when Carl and I fell in love with each\n\n23:50.860 --> 23:51.860\n other.\n\n23:51.860 --> 23:55.600\n We had fallen in love with each other long before because we'd known each other for years,\n\n23:55.600 --> 23:59.680\n but it was the first time that we had expressed our feelings for each other.\n\n23:59.680 --> 24:01.800\n Acknowledged it, the existence of this love.\n\n24:01.800 --> 24:09.560\n Yes, because we were both involved with other people and it was a completely outside his\n\n24:09.560 --> 24:13.920\n morality and mine to even broach the subject.\n\n24:13.920 --> 24:17.600\n But it was only days after that it happened.\n\n24:17.600 --> 24:20.760\n And for me, it was a eureka moment.\n\n24:20.760 --> 24:28.800\n It was in the context of finding that piece of Chinese music that was worthy to represent\n\n24:28.800 --> 24:34.440\n one of the oldest musical traditions on earth when those of us who worked on the Voyager\n\n24:34.440 --> 24:38.120\n record were completely ignorant about Chinese music.\n\n24:38.120 --> 24:46.400\n And so that had been a constant challenge for me, talking to professors of Chinese music,\n\n24:46.400 --> 24:51.840\n listening to musicologists everywhere and all through the project, desperately trying\n\n24:51.840 --> 24:54.200\n to find this one piece.\n\n24:54.200 --> 25:02.400\n Found the piece, lived on the Upper West Side, found the piece, a professor at Columbia University\n\n25:02.400 --> 25:04.600\n gave it to me.\n\n25:04.600 --> 25:08.960\n And of all the people I talked to, everyone had said, that's hopeless.\n\n25:08.960 --> 25:09.960\n You can't do that.\n\n25:09.960 --> 25:12.880\n There can't be one piece of Chinese music.\n\n25:12.880 --> 25:17.760\n But he was completely, no problem, I've got it.\n\n25:17.760 --> 25:24.840\n And so he told me the story of the piece, which only made it an even greater candidate\n\n25:24.840 --> 25:27.280\n for the record.\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:35.920\n And I listened to it, called Carl Sagan, who was in Tucson, Arizona addressing the American\n\n25:35.920 --> 25:40.920\n Society of Newspaper Editors.\n\n25:40.920 --> 25:45.800\n And I left him a message, hotel message center.\n\n25:45.800 --> 25:51.480\n And he called me back an hour later.\n\n25:51.480 --> 25:58.200\n And I heard this beautiful voice say, I get back to my hotel room, and I find this message\n\n25:58.200 --> 26:00.160\n that Annie called.\n\n26:00.160 --> 26:05.460\n And I asked myself, why didn't you leave me this message 10 years ago?\n\n26:05.460 --> 26:09.440\n My heart was beating out of my chest.\n\n26:09.440 --> 26:19.960\n I, it was for me a kind of eureka moment, a scientific breakthrough, a truth, a great\n\n26:19.960 --> 26:24.120\n truth had suddenly been revealed.\n\n26:24.120 --> 26:27.760\n And of course, I was awkward and didn't really know what to say.\n\n26:27.760 --> 26:32.040\n And so I blurted something out like, oh, I've been meaning to talk to you about that, Carl,\n\n26:32.040 --> 26:33.040\n which wasn't really true.\n\n26:33.040 --> 26:34.480\n I never would have talked to him about it.\n\n26:34.480 --> 26:36.400\n We had been alone countless times.\n\n26:36.400 --> 26:41.880\n We humans are so awkward in these moments and these amazing moments.\n\n26:41.880 --> 26:45.500\n And I just said, for keeps.\n\n26:45.500 --> 26:51.880\n And he thought for a very brief, like a second and said, you mean get married?\n\n26:51.880 --> 26:52.880\n And I said, yeah.\n\n26:52.880 --> 26:55.460\n And he said, yeah.\n\n26:55.460 --> 27:00.280\n And we put down the phone.\n\n27:00.280 --> 27:10.080\n And I literally was jumping around my apartment like a lunatic, because it was so obvious,\n\n27:10.080 --> 27:12.920\n you know, it was something like, of course.\n\n27:12.920 --> 27:14.320\n And then the phone rang again.\n\n27:14.320 --> 27:19.400\n And I thought, damn, no, he's going to say, I don't know what I was saying.\n\n27:19.400 --> 27:20.400\n I am married.\n\n27:20.400 --> 27:21.400\n I have a kid.\n\n27:21.400 --> 27:23.600\n I'm not going to do this, you know?\n\n27:23.600 --> 27:27.920\n But he was like, I just want to make sure that that really happened.\n\n27:27.920 --> 27:28.920\n And I said, yeah.\n\n27:28.920 --> 27:30.800\n And he said, we're getting married.\n\n27:30.800 --> 27:32.960\n And I said, yeah, we're getting married.\n\n27:32.960 --> 27:36.760\n Now this was June 1st, 1977.\n\n27:36.760 --> 27:42.240\n The records had not been affixed to the spacecraft yet.\n\n27:42.240 --> 27:47.560\n And there had been a lot of controversy about what we were doing.\n\n27:47.560 --> 27:58.120\n I should say that among the 118 pictures was an image of a man and a woman, frontally,\n\n27:58.120 --> 28:00.080\n completely naked.\n\n28:00.080 --> 28:07.880\n And there was, I believe, a congressman on the floor that said, NASA to send smut to\n\n28:07.880 --> 28:09.800\n the stars, you know?\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:14.560\n And so NASA really, they got very upset and they said, you can't send a picture.\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:16.360\n And we had done it so that it was so brilliant.\n\n28:16.360 --> 28:20.580\n It was like this lovely couple, completely naked.\n\n28:20.580 --> 28:29.080\n And then the next image was a kind of overlay schematic to show the fetus inside this woman\n\n28:29.080 --> 28:30.360\n that was developing.\n\n28:30.360 --> 28:36.440\n And then that went off into, you know, additional imagery of human reproduction.\n\n28:36.440 --> 28:44.600\n And it really hit me that how much we hate ourselves, that we couldn't bear to be seen\n\n28:44.600 --> 28:46.600\n as we are.\n\n28:46.600 --> 28:53.200\n So in some sense that congressman also represents our society.\n\n28:53.200 --> 28:55.840\n Perhaps his opposition should have been included as well.\n\n28:55.840 --> 28:56.840\n Yes.\n\n28:56.840 --> 29:02.240\n Well, that was one of the most vigorous debates during the making of the record with the,\n\n29:02.240 --> 29:08.000\n you know, the five, six people that we collaborated with was, do we show, do we only put our best\n\n29:08.000 --> 29:09.640\n foot forward?\n\n29:09.640 --> 29:17.520\n Or do we show Hiroshima, Auschwitz, the Congo, what we have done?\n\n29:17.520 --> 29:20.800\n What do you think represents humanity?\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:26.440\n If you kind of, if you think about it, do our darker moments, are they essential for\n\n29:26.440 --> 29:27.440\n humanity?\n\n29:27.440 --> 29:32.360\n All the wars we've been through, all the tortures and the suffering and the cruelty.\n\n29:32.360 --> 29:37.400\n Is that essential for happiness, for beauty, for creation, generally speaking?\n\n29:37.400 --> 29:40.600\n Well, certainly not essential for happiness or beauty, that's for sure.\n\n29:40.600 --> 29:45.920\n I mean, it's part of who we are, if we're going to be real about it, which is, you know,\n\n29:45.920 --> 29:51.840\n I think we tell on ourselves, even if we don't want to be real, we, you know, I think that\n\n29:51.840 --> 29:58.320\n if you're a spacefaring civilization, and you've gotten it together sufficiently, that\n\n29:58.320 --> 30:05.240\n you can move from world to world, then I think they probably took one look at this derelict\n\n30:05.240 --> 30:11.840\n spacecraft and they knew that these were people in their technological adolescence, and they\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:18.600\n were just setting forth, and they must have had these issues, you know, because it's,\n\n30:18.600 --> 30:24.200\n and so it really, you know, that's the great thing about lying is that a lie only has a\n\n30:24.200 --> 30:25.200\n shelf life.\n\n30:25.200 --> 30:32.480\n It's like, if like a great work of art that's a forgery, people can be fooled immediately,\n\n30:32.480 --> 30:37.300\n but 10 or 15 years, 20 years later, they start to look at it and, you know, they begin to\n\n30:37.300 --> 30:45.480\n realize the lens, our lens of our present is coloring everything that we see.\n\n30:45.480 --> 30:52.520\n So you know, I think it didn't matter that we didn't show our atrocities.\n\n30:52.520 --> 30:54.200\n They would fill in the blanks.\n\n30:54.200 --> 30:55.200\n They would fill in the blanks.\n\n30:55.200 --> 31:02.440\n So let me sort of ask, you've mentioned how unlikely it is that you and Carl did two souls\n\n31:02.440 --> 31:06.340\n like yours would meet in this vast world.\n\n31:06.340 --> 31:12.000\n What are your views on how and why incredibly unlikely things like these nevertheless do\n\n31:12.000 --> 31:13.000\n happen?\n\n31:13.000 --> 31:15.240\n It's purely to me, chance.\n\n31:15.240 --> 31:17.920\n It's totally random.\n\n31:17.920 --> 31:24.080\n It's a just, I mean, but, and the fact is, is that some people are, and it's happening\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:26.120\n every day right now.\n\n31:26.120 --> 31:33.080\n Some people are the random casualties of chance and that, and I don't just mean the people\n\n31:33.080 --> 31:41.200\n who are being, you know, destroyed in childhood, in wartime, I'm also, or the people who starved\n\n31:41.200 --> 31:52.120\n to death because of famine, but also the people who, you know, who are not living to the fullest,\n\n31:52.120 --> 31:53.120\n all of these things.\n\n31:53.120 --> 31:57.560\n And I think there's a, my parents met on the subway in rush hour.\n\n31:57.560 --> 32:03.560\n And so I'm only here with you because of the most random possible situation.\n\n32:03.560 --> 32:08.600\n And so I've had this, a sense of this, even before I knew Carl, I always felt this way\n\n32:08.600 --> 32:17.360\n that I only existed because of the generosity of the rush hour, no, of just all of the things,\n\n32:17.360 --> 32:21.360\n all of the skeins of causality.\n\n32:21.360 --> 32:26.680\n It's interesting because, you know, the rush hour is a source of stress for a lot of people,\n\n32:26.680 --> 32:32.560\n but clearly in its moments, it can also be a source of something beautiful.\n\n32:32.560 --> 32:33.560\n That's right.\n\n32:33.560 --> 32:35.340\n Of strangers meeting and so on.\n\n32:35.340 --> 32:43.000\n So everything, everything is, has a possibility of doing something beautiful.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:50.080\n So let me ask sort of a quick tangent on the Voyager, this, this beautiful romantic notion\n\n32:50.080 --> 32:55.880\n that Voyager One is sort of our farthest human reach into space.\n\n32:55.880 --> 33:00.940\n If you think of what, I don't know if you've seen, but what Elon Musk did with putting\n\n33:00.940 --> 33:07.280\n the Roadster, letting it fly out into space, there's a sort of humor to it.\n\n33:07.280 --> 33:12.000\n I think that's also kind of interesting, but maybe you can comment on that.\n\n33:12.000 --> 33:20.080\n But in general, if now that we are developing what we were venturing out into space again\n\n33:20.080 --> 33:26.720\n in a more serious way, what kind of stuff that represent since Voyager was launched,\n\n33:26.720 --> 33:28.960\n should we send out as a followup?\n\n33:28.960 --> 33:35.160\n Is there things that you think that's developed in the next, in the 40 years after that we\n\n33:35.160 --> 33:38.160\n should update the spacefaring aliens?\n\n33:38.160 --> 33:44.640\n Well, of course now we could send the worldwide, we could send everything that's on the worldwide\n\n33:44.640 --> 33:45.640\n web.\n\n33:45.640 --> 33:50.760\n We could send, I mean, you know, that was a time when we're talking about photograph records\n\n33:50.760 --> 33:59.280\n and transistor radios and, you know, so we tried to be, to take advantage of the existing\n\n33:59.280 --> 34:04.660\n technology to the fullest extent, you know, the computer that was hooked up to me from\n\n34:04.660 --> 34:09.360\n my brainwaves and my heart sounds while I was meditating was, you know, the size of\n\n34:09.360 --> 34:11.000\n a gigantic room.\n\n34:11.000 --> 34:17.420\n And I'm sure it's not that, it didn't have the power of a phone, as the phone has now.\n\n34:17.420 --> 34:22.640\n So you know, now we could just, I think we could let it all hang out and just like send,\n\n34:22.640 --> 34:23.640\n you know, every week.\n\n34:23.640 --> 34:30.980\n I mean, that's the wonder, like I would send, you know, Wikipedia or something and not be\n\n34:30.980 --> 34:34.480\n a gatekeeper, but show who we are.\n\n34:34.480 --> 34:40.240\n You were also, it's interesting because one of the problems of the internet of having\n\n34:40.240 --> 34:47.600\n so much information is it's actually the curation, the human curation is still the powerful,\n\n34:47.600 --> 34:48.600\n beautiful thing.\n\n34:48.600 --> 34:49.600\n Yes.\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:54.080\n So what you did with the record is actually, is exactly the right process.\n\n34:54.080 --> 34:58.400\n It's kind of boiling down a massive amount of possibilities of what you could send into\n\n34:58.400 --> 35:05.180\n something that represents, you know, the better angels of our nature or represents our humanity.\n\n35:05.180 --> 35:11.560\n So if you think about, you know, what would you send from the internet as opposed to sending\n\n35:11.560 --> 35:17.840\n all of Wikipedia, for example, all human knowledge, is there something just new that we've developed,\n\n35:17.840 --> 35:24.440\n you think, or fundamentally we're still the same kind of human species?\n\n35:24.440 --> 35:32.280\n I think fundamentally we're the same, but we have advanced to an astonishing degree\n\n35:32.280 --> 35:37.680\n in our capacity for data retrieval and for transmission.\n\n35:37.680 --> 35:41.960\n And so, you know, I would send YouTube, I would send, you know, really like think of\n\n35:41.960 --> 35:52.920\n all the, you know, I still feel so lucky that there's any great musical artist of the last\n\n35:52.920 --> 36:00.120\n hundred years who I revere, I can just find them and watch them and listen to them.\n\n36:00.120 --> 36:02.000\n And you know, that's fantastic.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:09.880\n I also love how democratic it is that we each become curators and that we each decide those\n\n36:09.880 --> 36:10.880\n things.\n\n36:10.880 --> 36:18.000\n Now, I may not agree with, you know, the choices that everyone makes, but of course not because\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:19.040\n that's not the point.\n\n36:19.040 --> 36:26.560\n The point is, is that we are, you know, we have discovered largely through the internet\n\n36:26.560 --> 36:33.600\n that we are an intercommunicating organism and that can only be good.\n\n36:33.600 --> 36:36.680\n So you could also send now, Cosmos.\n\n36:36.680 --> 36:38.960\n Yes, I'd love to.\n\n36:38.960 --> 36:40.440\n I would be proud to.\n\n36:40.440 --> 36:49.560\n I mean, you've spoken about a very specific voice that Cosmos had in that it reveals the\n\n36:49.560 --> 36:50.560\n magic of science.\n\n36:50.560 --> 36:56.480\n I think you said shamanic journey of it and not the details of the latest breakthroughs\n\n36:56.480 --> 36:57.680\n or so on.\n\n36:57.680 --> 36:58.680\n Just revealing the magic.\n\n36:58.680 --> 37:07.320\n Can you try to describe what this voice of Cosmos is with the follow up and the new Cosmos\n\n37:07.320 --> 37:09.120\n that you're working on now?\n\n37:09.120 --> 37:18.040\n Yes, well, the dream of Cosmos is really like Einstein's quote, you know, it's the idea\n\n37:18.040 --> 37:25.400\n of the awesome power of science to be in absolutely everyone's hands.\n\n37:25.400 --> 37:27.880\n You know, it belongs to all of us.\n\n37:27.880 --> 37:31.800\n It's not the preserve of a priesthood.\n\n37:31.800 --> 37:37.800\n It's just the community of science is becoming more diverse and being less exclusive than\n\n37:37.800 --> 37:41.600\n it was guilty of in the not so recent past.\n\n37:41.600 --> 37:50.580\n The discoveries of science, our understanding of the Cosmos that we live in has really grown\n\n37:50.580 --> 37:58.880\n by leaps and bounds and probably we've learned more in the last hundred years about it.\n\n37:58.880 --> 38:04.360\n You know, the tempo of discovery has picked up so rapidly.\n\n38:04.360 --> 38:13.040\n And so the idea of Cosmos from the 1970s when Carl and I and Steven Soder, another astronomer,\n\n38:13.040 --> 38:23.240\n first imagined it was that interweaving not only of the scientific concepts and revelations\n\n38:23.240 --> 38:31.960\n and using, you know, cinematic VFX to take the viewer on this transporting, uplifting\n\n38:31.960 --> 38:36.520\n journey but also the stories of the searchers.\n\n38:36.520 --> 38:44.600\n Because the more I have learned about, you know, the process of science through my life\n\n38:44.600 --> 38:54.240\n with Carl and sense, the more I am really persuaded that it's that adherence to the\n\n38:54.240 --> 39:02.320\n facts and to that adherence to that little approximation, that little bit of reality\n\n39:02.320 --> 39:08.960\n that we've been able to get our hands around is something that we desperately need and\n\n39:08.960 --> 39:11.400\n it doesn't matter if you are a scientist.\n\n39:11.400 --> 39:15.960\n In fact, the people, it matters even more if you're not.\n\n39:15.960 --> 39:23.920\n And since, you know, the level of science teaching has been fairly or unfairly maligned\n\n39:23.920 --> 39:30.520\n and the idea that once there was such a thing as a television network, which of course has\n\n39:30.520 --> 39:37.280\n now evolved into many other things, the idea that you could in the most democratic way\n\n39:37.280 --> 39:44.000\n make accessible to absolutely everyone and most especially people who don't even realize\n\n39:44.000 --> 39:50.840\n that they have an interest in a subject or who feel so intimidated by the jargon of science\n\n39:50.840 --> 39:54.800\n and its kind of exclusive history.\n\n39:54.800 --> 40:01.860\n The idea that we could do this and, you know, in season two of Cosmos, the Space Time Odyssey,\n\n40:01.860 --> 40:06.440\n we were in 181 countries in the space of two weeks.\n\n40:06.440 --> 40:13.920\n It was the largest rollout in television history, which is really amazing for a, there is no\n\n40:13.920 --> 40:15.240\n science based programming.\n\n40:15.240 --> 40:20.800\n By the way, just to clarify, the series was rolled out, so it was shown in not that many\n\n40:20.800 --> 40:21.800\n countries.\n\n40:21.800 --> 40:22.800\n You said we were in.\n\n40:22.800 --> 40:25.800\n Well, our show was in 180 countries.\n\n40:25.800 --> 40:27.280\n Yeah, the show, which is incredible.\n\n40:27.280 --> 40:31.760\n I mean, the hundreds of millions, whatever that number is, the people that watched it,\n\n40:31.760 --> 40:33.560\n it's just, it's crazy.\n\n40:33.560 --> 40:43.440\n It's so crazy that, for instance, my son had a cerebral hemorrhage a year ago and the doctor\n\n40:43.440 --> 40:50.920\n who saved his life in a very dangerous situation.\n\n40:50.920 --> 40:59.560\n When he realized that, you know, that Sam and I were who we were, he said, that's why\n\n40:59.560 --> 41:00.560\n I'm here.\n\n41:00.560 --> 41:06.080\n You know, he said, if you come of age in a poor country like Colombia and Carl Sagan\n\n41:06.080 --> 41:13.440\n calls you to science when you're a child, then, then, you know, you go to medicine because\n\n41:13.440 --> 41:17.840\n that's the only avenue open to you, but that's why I'm here.\n\n41:17.840 --> 41:24.520\n And I've heard that story and I hear that story, I think every week.\n\n41:24.520 --> 41:26.120\n How does that make you feel?\n\n41:26.120 --> 41:31.520\n I mean, the number of scientists, I mean, a lot of it is quiet, right?\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:36.160\n But the number of scientists Cosmos has created is just countless.\n\n41:36.160 --> 41:40.520\n I mean, it probably touched a lot of, I don't know, probably it could be a crazy number\n\n41:40.520 --> 41:43.760\n of the 90% of scientists or something that have been.\n\n41:43.760 --> 41:50.240\n I would love to do that census because I, because that's the greatest gratification,\n\n41:50.240 --> 41:52.200\n because that's the dream of science.\n\n41:52.200 --> 41:58.360\n That's the whole idea is that if it belongs to all of us and not just a tiny few, then\n\n41:58.360 --> 42:03.240\n we have some chance of determining how it's used.\n\n42:03.240 --> 42:11.320\n And if it's only in the hands of people whose only, whose only interests are the balance\n\n42:11.320 --> 42:20.240\n sheet or hegemony over other nations or things like that, then it'll probably end up being\n\n42:20.240 --> 42:22.880\n a gun aimed at our heads.\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:30.640\n But if it's distributed in the widest possible way, a capability that we now have because\n\n42:30.640 --> 42:38.160\n of our technology, then the chance is that it will be used with wisdom.\n\n42:38.160 --> 42:39.160\n That's the dream of it.\n\n42:39.160 --> 42:42.960\n So that's why we did the first Cosmos.\n\n42:42.960 --> 42:48.840\n We wanted to take not just, as I say, the scientific information, but also tell the\n\n42:48.840 --> 42:53.000\n stories of these searchers.\n\n42:53.000 --> 43:03.280\n Because for us, and for me, carrying on this series in the second and third seasons, the\n\n43:03.280 --> 43:09.280\n primary interest was that we wouldn't tell a story unless it was a kind of a threefer.\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:17.560\n It was not just a way to understand a new scientific idea, but it was also a way to\n\n43:17.560 --> 43:24.880\n understand what, if it matters what's true, how the world can change for us and how we\n\n43:24.880 --> 43:27.400\n can be protected.\n\n43:27.400 --> 43:33.200\n And if it doesn't matter what's true, then we're in grave danger because we have the\n\n43:33.200 --> 43:41.280\n capability to not only destroy ourselves and our civilization, but to take so many species\n\n43:41.280 --> 43:42.280\n with us.\n\n43:42.280 --> 43:48.560\n And I'd like to talk to you about that particular, sort of the dangers of ourselves in a little\n\n43:48.560 --> 43:51.760\n bit, but sort of to linger on Cosmos.\n\n43:51.760 --> 44:00.360\n Maybe for the first, the 1980 and the 2014 follow up, what's a, or one of the, or several\n\n44:00.360 --> 44:07.160\n memorable moments from the creation of either of those seasons?\n\n44:07.160 --> 44:14.760\n Well, you know, the critical thing really was the fact that Seth MacFarlane became art\n\n44:14.760 --> 44:21.560\n champion because I had been with three colleagues, I had been schlepping around from network\n\n44:21.560 --> 44:29.200\n to network with a treatment for Cosmos and every network said they wanted to do it, but\n\n44:29.200 --> 44:34.680\n they wouldn't give me creative control and they wouldn't give me enough money to make\n\n44:34.680 --> 44:40.680\n it cinematic and to make it feel like you're really going on an adventure.\n\n44:40.680 --> 44:45.200\n And so I think both of those things, sorry to interrupt, both of those things are given\n\n44:45.200 --> 44:52.000\n what Cosmos represents, the legacy of it and the legacy of Carl Sagan is essential control,\n\n44:52.000 --> 44:54.160\n especially in the modern world.\n\n44:54.160 --> 44:58.000\n It's wonderful that you sought control, that you did not really push it.\n\n44:58.000 --> 44:59.000\n And I kept saying no.\n\n44:59.000 --> 45:04.040\n And my partners, I'm sure, you know, they would look at me like I was nuts, you know,\n\n45:04.040 --> 45:08.160\n and they probably must have entertained the idea that maybe I didn't really want to do\n\n45:08.160 --> 45:12.360\n it, you know, because I was afraid or something, but I kept saying no.\n\n45:12.360 --> 45:21.160\n And it wasn't until I met Seth MacFarlane and he took me to Fox and to Peter Rice and\n\n45:21.160 --> 45:25.920\n said, you know, I'll pay for half the pilot if I have to, you know, and Peter Rice was\n\n45:25.920 --> 45:27.680\n like, put your money away.\n\n45:27.680 --> 45:39.080\n And in every time since, in the 10 years since, at every turn, when we needed Seth to intervene\n\n45:39.080 --> 45:43.560\n on our behalf, he stood up and he did it.\n\n45:43.560 --> 45:51.760\n And so that was like, in a way, that is the watershed for me of everything that followed\n\n45:51.760 --> 45:52.760\n since.\n\n45:52.760 --> 45:58.960\n And I was so lucky because, you know, Steve Soder and I written the original Cosmos with\n\n45:58.960 --> 46:04.080\n Carl and collaborated on the treatment for season two.\n\n46:04.080 --> 46:13.120\n And then Brennan Braga came into our project at the perfect moment and has proven to be\n\n46:13.120 --> 46:17.160\n just the, really, I have been so lucky my whole life.\n\n46:17.160 --> 46:23.760\n I've collaborated, I've been lucky with the people, my collaborators have been extraordinary.\n\n46:23.760 --> 46:26.200\n And so that was a critical thing.\n\n46:26.200 --> 46:33.560\n But also to have, you know, for instance, our astonishing VFX supervisor who comes from\n\n46:33.560 --> 46:39.840\n the movies, who heads the global association of VFX people, Jeff Okun.\n\n46:39.840 --> 46:46.680\n And then, you know, I could rattle off 10 more names, I'd be happy to do that.\n\n46:46.680 --> 46:49.720\n And it was that collaboration.\n\n46:49.720 --> 46:52.440\n So the people were essential to the creation of...\n\n46:52.440 --> 46:53.440\n Absolutely.\n\n46:53.440 --> 46:58.240\n I mean, when it came down, I have to say that when it came down to the vision of what the\n\n46:58.240 --> 47:04.000\n series would be, that was me sitting in my home, looking out the window and, you know,\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:06.720\n really imagining like what I wanted to do.\n\n47:06.720 --> 47:07.960\n Can you pause on that for a second?\n\n47:07.960 --> 47:08.960\n Like what's that process?\n\n47:08.960 --> 47:13.240\n Because it, you know, Cosmos is also, it's grounded in science, of course, but it's also\n\n47:13.240 --> 47:19.440\n incredibly imaginative and the words used are carefully crafted.\n\n47:19.440 --> 47:20.440\n Thank you.\n\n47:20.440 --> 47:21.440\n So what's...\n\n47:21.440 --> 47:28.480\n If you can talk about the process of that, the big picture, imaginative thinking, and\n\n47:28.480 --> 47:35.320\n sort of the rigorous crafting of words that like basically turns into something like poetry.\n\n47:35.320 --> 47:37.520\n Thank you so much.\n\n47:37.520 --> 47:44.120\n For me, these are rare occasions for human self esteem.\n\n47:44.120 --> 47:55.040\n The scientists that we bring to life in Cosmos are people, in my view, who have everything\n\n47:55.040 --> 48:00.520\n we need to see us through this current crisis.\n\n48:00.520 --> 48:09.840\n They're, very often they come, they're poor, they're female, they're outsiders who are\n\n48:09.840 --> 48:19.080\n not expected to have gifts that are so prodigious, but they persevere.\n\n48:19.080 --> 48:26.100\n And so you have someone like Michael Faraday, who comes from a family, dysfunctional family\n\n48:26.100 --> 48:33.920\n of like 14 people and, you know, it never goes to, university never learns the math.\n\n48:33.920 --> 48:42.080\n But, you know, is the, you know, there's Einstein years later looking up at the picture of Faraday\n\n48:42.080 --> 48:44.240\n to inspire him.\n\n48:44.240 --> 48:54.120\n So it's, you know, if we had people with that kind of humility and unselfishness who didn't\n\n48:54.120 --> 49:02.120\n want to patent everything, as, you know, Michael Faraday created the wealth of the 20th century\n\n49:02.120 --> 49:05.080\n with his various inventions.\n\n49:05.080 --> 49:09.520\n And yet he never took out a single patent at a time when people were patenting everything\n\n49:09.520 --> 49:13.080\n because that was not what he was about.\n\n49:13.080 --> 49:20.600\n And to me, that's a kind of almost a saintliness that says that, you know, here's a man who\n\n49:20.600 --> 49:28.120\n finds in his life, this tremendous gratification from searching.\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:30.760\n And it's just so impressive to me.\n\n49:30.760 --> 49:34.840\n And there are so many other people in Cosmos, especially the new season of Cosmos, which\n\n49:34.840 --> 49:36.320\n is called Possible Worlds.\n\n49:36.320 --> 49:37.880\n Possible, beautiful title.\n\n49:37.880 --> 49:44.520\n Possible Worlds, well, I stole it from an author and a scientist from the 1940s.\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:53.640\n But it, for me, encapsulates not just, you know, the exoplanets that we've begun to discover,\n\n49:53.640 --> 50:00.620\n not just, you know, the worlds that we might visit, but also the world that this could\n\n50:00.620 --> 50:03.360\n be, a hopeful vision of the future.\n\n50:03.360 --> 50:08.500\n You asked me what is common to all three seasons of Cosmos or what is that voice?\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:10.720\n It's a voice of hope.\n\n50:10.720 --> 50:17.820\n It's a voice that says there is a future which we bring to life in, I think, a fairly dazzling\n\n50:17.820 --> 50:21.920\n fashion that we can still have, you know?\n\n50:21.920 --> 50:27.080\n And in sitting down to imagine what this season would be, the new season would be, I'm sitting\n\n50:27.080 --> 50:35.560\n where I live in Ithaca, beautiful, just gorgeous place, trees everywhere, waterfalls, I'm sitting\n\n50:35.560 --> 50:41.600\n there thinking, well, you know, you can't, how do you, how do you awaken people?\n\n50:41.600 --> 50:45.920\n I mean, you can't yell at them and say we're all going to die, you know?\n\n50:45.920 --> 50:47.380\n It doesn't help.\n\n50:47.380 --> 50:49.220\n It doesn't help.\n\n50:49.220 --> 50:59.360\n But I think if you give them a vision of the future that's not pie in the sky, but something,\n\n50:59.360 --> 51:06.840\n ways in which science can be redemptive, can actually remediate our future.\n\n51:06.840 --> 51:15.640\n We have those capabilities right now, as well as the capabilities to do things in the Cosmos\n\n51:15.640 --> 51:19.040\n that we could be doing right now, but we're not doing them.\n\n51:19.040 --> 51:24.640\n Not because we don't know how to, how, you know, with the engineering or the material\n\n51:24.640 --> 51:30.880\n sciences or the physics, we know all we need to know, but we're a little bit paralyzed\n\n51:30.880 --> 51:33.120\n in some sense.\n\n51:33.120 --> 51:39.080\n And you know, we're like, I always think we're like the toddler, you know, like we, we left\n\n51:39.080 --> 51:43.560\n our mother's legs, you know, and scurried out to the moon.\n\n51:43.560 --> 51:46.440\n And we had a moment of, wow, we can do this.\n\n51:46.440 --> 51:51.920\n And then we realized, and somehow we had a failure of nerve and we went scurrying back\n\n51:51.920 --> 51:56.800\n to our mother and, you know, did things that really weren't going to get us out there,\n\n51:56.800 --> 52:02.440\n like the space shuttle, things like that, because it was a kind of failure of nerve.\n\n52:02.440 --> 52:07.080\n So Cosmos is about overcoming those fears.\n\n52:07.080 --> 52:12.360\n We're now as a civilization, ready to be a teenager venturing out into college.\n\n52:12.360 --> 52:13.840\n We're returning back.\n\n52:13.840 --> 52:14.840\n Exactly.\n\n52:14.840 --> 52:15.840\n Exactly.\n\n52:15.840 --> 52:25.640\n And that's one of my theories about our current situation is that this is our adolescence.\n\n52:25.640 --> 52:28.400\n And I was a total mess as an adolescent.\n\n52:28.400 --> 52:31.520\n I was reckless, irresponsible, totally.\n\n52:31.520 --> 52:34.160\n I didn't, I was inconsiderate.\n\n52:34.160 --> 52:41.520\n I, the reality of other people's feelings and the future didn't exist for me.\n\n52:41.520 --> 52:46.800\n So why should a technologically adolescent civilization be any different?\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:55.880\n But you know, the vast majority of people I know made it through that period and went\n\n52:55.880 --> 52:59.640\n on to be more wise.\n\n52:59.640 --> 53:02.840\n And that's what my hope is for our civilization.\n\n53:02.840 --> 53:10.600\n On a sort of a darker and more difficult subject in terms of, so you just talked about the\n\n53:10.600 --> 53:18.880\n Cosmos being an inspiration for science and for us growing out of our messy adolescence,\n\n53:18.880 --> 53:22.200\n but nevertheless, there is threats in this world.\n\n53:22.200 --> 53:25.400\n So do you worry about existential threats?\n\n53:25.400 --> 53:30.040\n Like you mentioned nuclear weapons, do you worry about nuclear war?\n\n53:30.040 --> 53:31.040\n Yes.\n\n53:31.040 --> 53:34.680\n And if you could also maybe comment, I don't know how much you've thought about it, but\n\n53:34.680 --> 53:40.840\n there's folks like Elon Musk who are worried about the existential threats of artificial\n\n53:40.840 --> 53:41.840\n intelligence.\n\n53:41.840 --> 53:49.400\n Sort of our robotic computer creations sort of resulting in us humans losing control.\n\n53:49.400 --> 53:54.240\n So can you speak to the things that worry you in terms of existential concerns?\n\n53:54.240 --> 53:55.240\n All of the above.\n\n53:55.240 --> 54:00.720\n You don't have to be silly, you know, like not to think and not to look at, for instance,\n\n54:00.720 --> 54:09.360\n our rapidly burgeoning capability in artificial intelligence.\n\n54:09.360 --> 54:16.920\n And to see how sick so much of the planet is not to be concerned.\n\n54:16.920 --> 54:18.920\n And sick is an evil potentially.\n\n54:18.920 --> 54:25.760\n Well, how much cruelty and brutality is happening at this very moment?\n\n54:25.760 --> 54:32.640\n And I would put climate change higher up on that list, because I believe that there are\n\n54:32.640 --> 54:39.600\n unforeseen discoveries that we are making right now, for instance, all that methane\n\n54:39.600 --> 54:47.480\n that's coming out of the ocean floor that was sequestered because of the permafrost,\n\n54:47.480 --> 54:49.560\n which is now melting.\n\n54:49.560 --> 54:56.840\n You know, I think there are other effects besides our greed and short term thinking\n\n54:56.840 --> 55:02.580\n that we are triggering now with all the greenhouse gases we're putting into the atmosphere.\n\n55:02.580 --> 55:04.160\n And that worries me day and night.\n\n55:04.160 --> 55:10.440\n I think about it every single, every moment, really, because I really think that's how\n\n55:10.440 --> 55:11.440\n we have to be.\n\n55:11.440 --> 55:23.600\n We have to begin to really focus on how grave the challenge is to our civilization and to\n\n55:23.600 --> 55:26.680\n the other species that are.\n\n55:26.680 --> 55:31.160\n It's a mass, this is a mass extinction event that we're living through.\n\n55:31.160 --> 55:32.760\n And we're seeing it.\n\n55:32.760 --> 55:35.160\n We're seeing news of it every day.\n\n55:35.160 --> 55:40.760\n So what do you think about another touchy subject, but what do you think about the politicization\n\n55:40.760 --> 55:46.400\n of science on topics like global warming and bionic stem cell research and other topics\n\n55:46.400 --> 55:47.560\n like it?\n\n55:47.560 --> 55:48.560\n What's your sense?\n\n55:48.560 --> 55:49.560\n Why?\n\n55:49.560 --> 55:53.200\n What do you mean by the politicization of global warming?\n\n55:53.200 --> 56:00.000\n Meaning that if you say, I think what you just said, which is a global warming is a\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:05.160\n serious concern, it's human caused and maybe some detrimental effects.\n\n56:05.160 --> 56:10.960\n Certainly there's a large percent of the population of the United States that would, as opposed\n\n56:10.960 --> 56:20.160\n to listening to that statement, would immediately think, oh, that's just a liberal talking point.\n\n56:20.160 --> 56:21.160\n That's what I mean by politicization.\n\n56:21.160 --> 56:22.240\n I think that's not so true anymore.\n\n56:22.240 --> 56:30.120\n I don't think our problem is a population that's skeptical about climate change because\n\n56:30.120 --> 56:37.240\n I think that the extreme weather and fire events that we are experiencing with such\n\n56:37.240 --> 56:40.720\n frequency is really gotten to people.\n\n56:40.720 --> 56:50.400\n I think that there are people in leadership positions who choose to ignore it and to pretend\n\n56:50.400 --> 56:55.640\n it's not there, but ultimately I think they will be rejected.\n\n56:55.640 --> 57:00.520\n The question is, will it be fast enough?\n\n57:00.520 --> 57:09.120\n I think actually that most people have really finally taken the reality of global climate\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:16.320\n change to heart and they look at their children and grandchildren and they don't feel good\n\n57:16.320 --> 57:24.860\n because they come from a world which was in many ways, in terms of climate, fairly familiar\n\n57:24.860 --> 57:29.920\n and benign and they know that we're headed in another direction and it's not just that,\n\n57:29.920 --> 57:35.480\n it's what we do to the oceans, the rivers, the air.\n\n57:35.480 --> 57:40.240\n You ask me, what is the message of cosmos?\n\n57:40.240 --> 57:46.960\n It's that we have to think in longer terms.\n\n57:46.960 --> 57:50.960\n I think of the Soviet Union and the United States in the Cold War and they're ready to\n\n57:50.960 --> 57:57.560\n kill each other over these two different views of the distribution of resources.\n\n57:57.560 --> 58:05.200\n But neither of them has a form of human social organization that thinks in terms of a hundred\n\n58:05.200 --> 58:11.800\n years, let alone a thousand years, which are the time scales that science speaks in.\n\n58:11.800 --> 58:19.200\n And that's part of the problem is that we have to get a grip on reality and where we're\n\n58:19.200 --> 58:30.560\n headed and I'm not fatalistic at all, but I do feel like, and in setting out to do this\n\n58:30.560 --> 58:37.880\n series each season, we were talking about climate change in the original cosmos in episode\n\n58:37.880 --> 58:46.120\n four and warning about inadvertent climate modification in 1980.\n\n58:46.120 --> 58:52.160\n And of course, Carl did his PhD thesis on the greenhouse effect on Venus and he was\n\n58:52.160 --> 58:58.200\n painfully cognizant of what a runaway greenhouse effect would do to our planet.\n\n58:58.200 --> 59:02.880\n And not only that, but the climatic history of the planet, which we go into in great detail\n\n59:02.880 --> 59:03.880\n in the series.\n\n59:03.880 --> 59:11.760\n So yeah, I mean, how are we going to get a grip on this if not through some kind of understanding\n\n59:11.760 --> 59:12.760\n of science?\n\n59:12.760 --> 59:22.320\n Can I just say one more thing about science is that its powers of prophecy are astonishing.\n\n59:22.320 --> 59:32.280\n You launch a spacecraft in 1977 and you know where each and every planet in the solar system\n\n59:32.280 --> 59:39.800\n is going to be and every moon and you rendezvous with that flawlessly and you exceed the design\n\n59:39.800 --> 59:44.840\n specifications of the greatest dreams of the engineers.\n\n59:44.840 --> 59:51.920\n And then you go on to explore the Milky Way galaxy and you do it, I mean, you know, the\n\n59:51.920 --> 59:59.240\n climate scientists, some of the people whose stories we tell in cosmos, their predictions\n\n59:59.240 --> 1:00:08.240\n were, and they were working with very early computer modeling capabilities, they have\n\n1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:12.800\n proven to be so robust, nuclear winter, all of these things.\n\n1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:19.720\n This is a prophetic power and yet how crazy that, you know, it's like the Romans with\n\n1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:26.640\n their lead cooking pots and their lead pipes or the Aztecs ripping out their own people's\n\n1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:27.640\n hearts.\n\n1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:28.800\n This is us.\n\n1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:35.240\n We know better and yet we are acting as if it's business as usual.\n\n1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:45.160\n Yeah, the beautiful complexity of human nature, speaking of which, let me ask a tough question\n\n1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:49.960\n I guess because there's so many possible answers, but what aspect of life here on earth do you\n\n1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:55.920\n find most fascinating from the origin of life, the evolutionary process itself, the origin\n\n1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.560\n of the human mind, so intelligence, some of the technological developments going on now\n\n1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:07.600\n or us venturing out into space or space exploration, what just inspires you?\n\n1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:09.280\n Oh, they all inspire me.\n\n1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:14.280\n Every one of those inspire me, but I have to say that to me at the origin of, as I've\n\n1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:22.960\n gotten older, to me, the origin of life has become less interesting because I feel, well,\n\n1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:31.640\n not because it's more, I think I understand, I have a better grasp of how it might've happened.\n\n1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:33.280\n Do you think it was a huge leap?\n\n1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:42.560\n I think it was a, we are a byproduct of geophysics and I think it's not, my suspicion of course,\n\n1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:50.520\n which is take it with a grain of salt, but my suspicion is that it happens more often\n\n1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:56.840\n and more places than we like to think because after all the history of our thinking about\n\n1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:04.360\n ourselves has been a constant series of demotions in which we've had to realize, no, no, so\n\n1:02:04.360 --> 1:02:05.360\n to me that's...\n\n1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:06.360\n We're not at the center of the solar system.\n\n1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:12.800\n And the origin of consciousness is to me also not so amazing if you think of it as going\n\n1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:22.400\n back to these one celled organisms of a billion years ago who had to know, well, if I go higher\n\n1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:30.480\n up, I'll get too much sun and if I go lower down, I'll be protected from UV rays, things\n\n1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:31.480\n like that.\n\n1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:34.320\n They had to know that or you, I eat, me, I don't.\n\n1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:41.440\n I mean, even that, I can see if you know that, then knowing what we know now, it's just,\n\n1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:43.680\n it's not so hard to fathom.\n\n1:02:43.680 --> 1:02:50.960\n It seems like, I've never believed there was a duality between our minds and our bodies\n\n1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:57.360\n and I think that even consciousness, all those interesting things seem to me, except one\n\n1:02:57.360 --> 1:02:58.360\n of the things...\n\n1:02:58.360 --> 1:02:59.360\n A byproduct of geophysics.\n\n1:02:59.360 --> 1:03:07.040\n Yeah, all of chemistry, yes, geochemistry, geophysics, absolutely.\n\n1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:12.440\n It makes perfect sense to me and it doesn't make it any less wondrous.\n\n1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:19.320\n It doesn't rob it at all of the wonder of it.\n\n1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.600\n And so, yeah, I think that's amazing.\n\n1:03:21.600 --> 1:03:27.180\n I think we tell the story of someone you have never heard of, I guarantee, and I think you're\n\n1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:34.560\n very knowledgeable on the subject, who was more responsible for our ability to venture\n\n1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:40.680\n out to other worlds than anyone else and who was completely forgotten.\n\n1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:44.400\n And so, those are the kinds of stories I like best for Cosmos because...\n\n1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:45.400\n Can you tell me who?\n\n1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:53.640\n No, I'm going to make you watch this series, I'm going to make you buy my book, but I'm\n\n1:03:53.640 --> 1:04:03.280\n just saying, this person would be forgotten, but the way that we do Cosmos is that I ask\n\n1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:08.620\n a question to myself, I really want to get to the bottom to the answer and keep going\n\n1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:14.800\n deeper, deeper until we find what the story is, a story that I know because I'm not a\n\n1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:15.800\n scientist.\n\n1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:22.480\n If it moves me, if it moves me, then I want to tell it and other people will be moved.\n\n1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:28.760\n Do you ponder mortality, human mortality, and maybe even your own mortality?\n\n1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:30.360\n Oh, all the time.\n\n1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:34.080\n I just turned 70, so yeah, I think about it a lot.\n\n1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:37.520\n I mean, it's, you know, how can you not think about it?\n\n1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:48.120\n What do you make of this short life of ours, I mean, let me ask a sort of another way,\n\n1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:58.520\n you've lost Carl, and speaking of mortality, if you could be, if you could choose immortality,\n\n1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:02.520\n you know, it's possible that science allows us to live much, much longer.\n\n1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:05.800\n Is that something you would choose for yourself, for Carl, for you?\n\n1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:07.080\n Well, for Carl, definitely.\n\n1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:12.400\n I would have, you know, in a nanosecond, I would take that deal.\n\n1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:13.400\n But not for me.\n\n1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:17.880\n I mean, if Carl were alive, yes, I would want to live forever because I know it would be\n\n1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:18.880\n fun.\n\n1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:19.880\n But no.\n\n1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:20.880\n Would it be fun forever?\n\n1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:21.880\n I don't know.\n\n1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:22.880\n That's the essential nature of the...\n\n1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:23.880\n I don't know.\n\n1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:29.000\n It's just that the universe is so full of so many wonderful things to discover that\n\n1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.560\n it feels like it would be fun.\n\n1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.120\n But no, I don't want to live forever.\n\n1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:37.160\n I have had a magical life.\n\n1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:42.000\n I just, you know, my craziest dreams have come true.\n\n1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:54.040\n And I feel, you know, forgive me, but this crazy quirk of fate that put my most joyful,\n\n1:05:54.040 --> 1:06:00.760\n deepest feelings, feelings that decades later, 42 years later, I know how real, how true\n\n1:06:00.760 --> 1:06:02.880\n those feelings were.\n\n1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:09.960\n Everything that happened after that was an affirmation of how true those feelings were.\n\n1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:12.080\n And so, I don't feel that way.\n\n1:06:12.080 --> 1:06:20.880\n I feel like I have gotten so much more than my share, not just my extraordinary life with\n\n1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:31.120\n Carl, my family, my parents, my children, my friends, the places that I've been able\n\n1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:36.920\n to explore, the books I've read, the music I've heard.\n\n1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:44.440\n So I feel like, you know, if it would be much better if instead of working on the immortality\n\n1:06:44.440 --> 1:06:51.020\n of the lucky few of the most privileged people in this society, I would really like to see\n\n1:06:51.020 --> 1:06:55.940\n a concerted effort for us to get our act together, you know?\n\n1:06:55.940 --> 1:07:04.800\n That to me is topic A, more pressing, you know, this possible world, that is the challenge.\n\n1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:11.000\n And we're at a kind of moment where if we can make that choice.\n\n1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.080\n So immortality doesn't really interest me.\n\n1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:23.600\n I really, I love nature and I have to say that because I'm a product of nature, I recognize\n\n1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:27.960\n that it's great gifts and it's great cruelty.\n\n1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:33.960\n Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it, and thank you so much for talking\n\n1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:34.960\n to us.\n\n1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:35.960\n It was an honor.\n\n1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:36.960\n Oh, it's wonderful.\n\n1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:37.960\n I really appreciate it.\n\n1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:38.960\n I really enjoyed it.\n\n1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:39.960\n I thought your questions were great.\n\n1:07:39.960 --> 1:07:40.960\n Thank you.\n\n1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:44.040\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ann Druyan, and thank you

1:08:23.040\n It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny\n\n1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:24.360\n dark squiggles.\n\n1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:29.760\n But one glance at it, and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead\n\n1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:32.080\n for thousands of years.\n\n1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:37.880\n Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly\n\n1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:39.760\n to you.\n\n1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.440\n Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions.\n\n1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:50.460\n Finding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs.\n\n1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:53.080\n Books break the shackles of time.\n\n1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:59.640\n A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.\n\n1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:13.760\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
