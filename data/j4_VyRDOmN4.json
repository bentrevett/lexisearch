specializing in string theory.\n\n00:07.140 --> 00:10.940\n He is the winner of the 2017 Breakthrough Prize\n\n00:10.940 --> 00:12.300\n in Fundamental Physics,\n\n00:12.300 --> 00:15.740\n which is the most lucrative academic prize in the world.\n\n00:15.740 --> 00:17.380\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:17.380 --> 00:20.140\n Headspace, Jordan Harmer's show,\n\n00:20.140 --> 00:22.860\n Squarespace, and Allform.\n\n00:22.860 --> 00:25.980\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:25.980 --> 00:28.020\n As a side note, let me say that string theory\n\n00:28.020 --> 00:29.940\n is a theory of quantum gravity\n\n00:29.940 --> 00:33.260\n that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\n00:33.260 --> 00:36.660\n It says that quarks, electrons, and all other particles\n\n00:36.660 --> 00:40.300\n are made up of much tinier strings of vibrating energy.\n\n00:40.300 --> 00:42.920\n They vibrate in 10 or more dimensions,\n\n00:42.920 --> 00:45.020\n depending on the flavor of the theory.\n\n00:45.020 --> 00:48.620\n Different vibrating patterns result in different particles.\n\n00:48.620 --> 00:50.660\n From its origins, for a long time,\n\n00:50.660 --> 00:54.680\n string theory was seen as too good not to be true,\n\n00:54.680 --> 00:56.380\n but has recently fallen out of favor\n\n00:56.380 --> 00:57.660\n in the physics community,\n\n00:57.660 --> 01:00.180\n partly because over the past 40 years,\n\n01:00.180 --> 01:03.100\n it has not been able to make any novel predictions\n\n01:03.100 --> 01:06.260\n that could then be validated through experiment.\n\n01:06.260 --> 01:08.260\n Nevertheless, to this day,\n\n01:08.260 --> 01:10.420\n it remains one of our best candidates\n\n01:10.420 --> 01:12.140\n for a theory of everything,\n\n01:12.140 --> 01:15.540\n or a theory that unifies the laws of physics.\n\n01:15.540 --> 01:18.000\n Let me mention that a similar story happened\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:18.980\n with neural networks\n\n01:18.980 --> 01:21.060\n in the field of artificial intelligence,\n\n01:21.060 --> 01:22.580\n where it fell out of favor\n\n01:22.580 --> 01:24.820\n after decades of promise and research,\n\n01:24.820 --> 01:28.000\n but found success again in the past decade\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.340\n as part of the deep learning revolution.\n\n01:30.340 --> 01:33.140\n So I think it pays to keep an open mind,\n\n01:33.140 --> 01:36.020\n since we don't know which of the ideas in physics\n\n01:36.020 --> 01:38.100\n may be brought back decades later\n\n01:38.100 --> 01:40.640\n and be found to solve the biggest mysteries\n\n01:40.640 --> 01:42.380\n in theoretical physics.\n\n01:42.380 --> 01:45.980\n String theory still has that promise.\n\n01:45.980 --> 01:47.740\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n01:47.740 --> 01:50.820\n and here's my conversation with Kamran Wafa.\n\n01:51.860 --> 01:54.580\n What is the difference between mathematics\n\n01:54.580 --> 01:55.700\n and physics?\n\n01:55.700 --> 01:57.460\n Well, that's a difficult question,\n\n01:57.460 --> 01:58.420\n because in many ways,\n\n01:58.420 --> 02:01.640\n math and physics are unified in many ways.\n\n02:01.640 --> 02:04.480\n So to distinguish them is not an easy task.\n\n02:04.480 --> 02:06.420\n I would say that perhaps the goals\n\n02:06.420 --> 02:08.420\n of math and physics are different.\n\n02:09.640 --> 02:14.420\n Math does not care to describe reality, physics does.\n\n02:14.420 --> 02:16.220\n That's the major difference.\n\n02:16.220 --> 02:19.380\n But a lot of the thoughts, processes, and so on,\n\n02:19.380 --> 02:22.780\n which goes to understanding the nature and reality,\n\n02:22.780 --> 02:24.680\n are the same things that mathematicians do.\n\n02:24.680 --> 02:26.340\n So in many ways, they are similar.\n\n02:27.220 --> 02:31.660\n Mathematicians care about deductive reasoning,\n\n02:32.680 --> 02:35.500\n and physicists or physics in general,\n\n02:35.500 --> 02:36.740\n we care less about that.\n\n02:37.700 --> 02:40.980\n We care more about interconnection of ideas,\n\n02:40.980 --> 02:42.900\n about how ideas support each other,\n\n02:42.900 --> 02:46.220\n or if there's a puzzle, discord between ideas.\n\n02:46.220 --> 02:48.220\n That's more interesting for us.\n\n02:48.220 --> 02:50.540\n And part of the reason is that we have learned in physics\n\n02:50.540 --> 02:53.300\n that the ideas are not sequential.\n\n02:53.300 --> 02:54.920\n And if we think that there's one idea\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:56.020\n which is more important,\n\n02:56.020 --> 02:58.180\n and we start with there and go to the next idea,\n\n02:58.180 --> 02:59.780\n and next one, and deduce things from that,\n\n02:59.780 --> 03:01.580\n like mathematicians do,\n\n03:01.580 --> 03:03.740\n we have learned that the third or fourth thing\n\n03:03.740 --> 03:05.580\n we deduce from that principle\n\n03:05.580 --> 03:08.380\n turns out later on to be the actual principle.\n\n03:08.380 --> 03:10.900\n And from a different perspective,\n\n03:10.900 --> 03:12.740\n starting from there leads to new ideas,\n\n03:12.740 --> 03:14.940\n which the original one didn't lead to,\n\n03:14.940 --> 03:18.140\n and that's the beginning of a new revolution in science.\n\n03:18.140 --> 03:20.220\n So this kind of thing we have seen again and again\n\n03:20.220 --> 03:21.080\n in the history of science,\n\n03:21.080 --> 03:24.100\n we have learned to not like deductive reasoning\n\n03:24.100 --> 03:27.180\n because that gives us a bad starting point,\n\n03:27.180 --> 03:30.260\n to think that we actually have the original thought process\n\n03:30.260 --> 03:32.220\n should be viewed as the primary thought,\n\n03:32.220 --> 03:33.920\n and all these are deductions,\n\n03:33.920 --> 03:35.580\n like the way mathematicians sometimes do.\n\n03:35.580 --> 03:37.980\n So in physics, we have learned to be skeptical\n\n03:37.980 --> 03:38.940\n of that way of thinking.\n\n03:38.940 --> 03:41.220\n We have to be a bit open to the possibility\n\n03:41.220 --> 03:44.260\n that what we thought is a deduction of a hypothesis\n\n03:44.260 --> 03:47.080\n is actually the reason that's true is the opposite.\n\n03:47.080 --> 03:48.940\n And so we reverse the order.\n\n03:48.940 --> 03:52.660\n And so this switching back and forth between ideas\n\n03:52.660 --> 03:56.620\n makes us more fluid about deductive fashion.\n\n03:56.620 --> 03:59.460\n Of course, it sometimes gives a wrong impression\n\n03:59.460 --> 04:00.980\n like physicists don't care about rigor.\n\n04:00.980 --> 04:03.380\n They just say random things.\n\n04:03.380 --> 04:05.900\n They are willing to say things that are not backed\n\n04:05.900 --> 04:07.780\n by the logical reasoning.\n\n04:07.780 --> 04:09.220\n That's not true at all.\n\n04:09.220 --> 04:12.620\n So despite this fluidity\n\n04:12.620 --> 04:14.980\n in saying which one is a primary thought,\n\n04:14.980 --> 04:17.100\n we are very careful about trying to understand\n\n04:17.100 --> 04:19.900\n what we have really understood in terms of relationship\n\n04:19.900 --> 04:21.140\n between ideas.\n\n04:21.140 --> 04:24.000\n So that's an important ingredient.\n\n04:24.000 --> 04:27.340\n And in fact, solid math, being behind physics\n\n04:27.340 --> 04:30.740\n is I think one of the attractive features\n\n04:30.740 --> 04:32.220\n of a physical law.\n\n04:32.220 --> 04:35.260\n So we look for beautiful math underpinning it.\n\n04:35.260 --> 04:39.740\n Can we dig into that process of starting from one place\n\n04:39.740 --> 04:43.060\n and then ending up at like the fourth step\n\n04:43.060 --> 04:46.120\n and realizing all along that the place you started at\n\n04:46.120 --> 04:47.000\n was wrong?\n\n04:47.000 --> 04:50.540\n So is that happened when there's a discrepancy\n\n04:50.540 --> 04:53.140\n between what the math says\n\n04:53.140 --> 04:54.940\n and what the physical world shows?\n\n04:54.940 --> 04:56.860\n Is that how you then can go back\n\n04:56.860 --> 04:59.660\n and do the revolutionary idea\n\n04:59.660 --> 05:02.060\n for different starting place altogether?\n\n05:02.060 --> 05:04.800\n Perhaps I give an example to see how it goes.\n\n05:04.800 --> 05:08.820\n And in fact, the historical example is Newton's work\n\n05:08.820 --> 05:10.140\n on classical mechanics.\n\n05:10.140 --> 05:14.320\n So Newton formulated the laws of mechanics,\n\n05:14.320 --> 05:17.860\n the force F equals to MA and his other laws,\n\n05:17.860 --> 05:20.980\n and they look very simple, elegant, and so forth.\n\n05:20.980 --> 05:25.860\n Later, when we studied more examples of mechanics\n\n05:25.860 --> 05:28.980\n and other similar things, physicists came up with the idea\n\n05:28.980 --> 05:31.420\n that the notion of potential is interesting.\n\n05:31.420 --> 05:33.820\n Potential was an abstract idea, which kind of came,\n\n05:33.820 --> 05:37.000\n you could take its gradient and relate it to the force.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:38.720\n So you don't really need it a priori,\n\n05:38.720 --> 05:41.200\n but it solved, helped some thoughts.\n\n05:41.200 --> 05:45.940\n And then later, Euler and Lagrange reformulated\n\n05:45.940 --> 05:49.220\n Newtonian mechanics in a totally different way\n\n05:49.220 --> 05:50.340\n in the following fashion.\n\n05:50.340 --> 05:51.580\n They said, if you take,\n\n05:51.580 --> 05:53.580\n if you wanna know where a particle at this point\n\n05:53.580 --> 05:55.980\n and at this time, how does it get to this point\n\n05:55.980 --> 05:58.940\n at the later time, is the following.\n\n05:58.940 --> 06:01.620\n You take all possible paths connecting this particle\n\n06:01.620 --> 06:04.660\n from going from the initial point to the final point,\n\n06:04.660 --> 06:07.140\n and you compute the action.\n\n06:07.140 --> 06:08.380\n And what is an action?\n\n06:08.380 --> 06:10.780\n Action is the integral over time\n\n06:10.780 --> 06:14.160\n of the kinetic term of the particle minus its potential.\n\n06:15.020 --> 06:16.780\n So you take this integral,\n\n06:16.780 --> 06:19.100\n and each path will give you some quantity.\n\n06:19.100 --> 06:23.060\n And the path it actually takes, the physical path,\n\n06:23.060 --> 06:26.580\n is the one which minimizes this integral or this action.\n\n06:26.580 --> 06:29.900\n Now, this sounded like a backward step from Newton's.\n\n06:29.900 --> 06:32.720\n Newton's formula seemed very simple.\n\n06:32.720 --> 06:35.180\n F equals to ma, and you can write F is minus\n\n06:35.180 --> 06:36.860\n the gradient of the potential.\n\n06:36.860 --> 06:40.020\n So why would anybody start formulating such a simple thing\n\n06:40.020 --> 06:43.220\n in terms of this complicated looking principle?\n\n06:43.220 --> 06:46.740\n You have to study the space of all paths and all things\n\n06:46.740 --> 06:48.740\n and find the minimum, and then you get the same equation.\n\n06:48.740 --> 06:50.020\n So what's the point?\n\n06:50.020 --> 06:52.460\n So Euler and Lagrange's formulation of Newton,\n\n06:52.460 --> 06:56.440\n which was kind of recasting in this language,\n\n06:56.440 --> 06:58.060\n is just a consequence of Newton's law.\n\n06:58.060 --> 06:59.820\n F equals to ma gives you the same fact\n\n06:59.820 --> 07:02.220\n that this path is a minimum action.\n\n07:02.220 --> 07:05.420\n Now, what we learned later, last century,\n\n07:05.420 --> 07:08.520\n was that when we deal with quantum mechanics,\n\n07:08.520 --> 07:11.780\n Newton's law is only an average correct.\n\n07:12.960 --> 07:15.820\n And the particle going from one to the other\n\n07:15.820 --> 07:17.880\n doesn't take exactly one path.\n\n07:17.880 --> 07:21.780\n It takes all the paths with the amplitude,\n\n07:21.780 --> 07:23.660\n which is proportional to the exponential\n\n07:23.660 --> 07:26.940\n of the action times an imaginary number, i.\n\n07:26.940 --> 07:29.940\n And so this fact turned out to be the reformulation\n\n07:29.940 --> 07:30.780\n of quantum mechanics.\n\n07:30.780 --> 07:33.500\n We should start there as the basis of the new law,\n\n07:33.500 --> 07:35.660\n which is quantum mechanics, and Newton is only\n\n07:35.660 --> 07:37.980\n an approximation on the average correct.\n\n07:37.980 --> 07:40.460\n And when you say amplitude, you mean probability?\n\n07:40.460 --> 07:43.180\n Yes, the amplitude means if you sum up all these paths\n\n07:43.180 --> 07:45.100\n with exponential i times the action,\n\n07:45.100 --> 07:48.380\n if you sum this up, you get the number, complex number.\n\n07:48.380 --> 07:50.480\n You square the norm of this complex number,\n\n07:50.480 --> 07:52.740\n gives you a probability to go from one to the other.\n\n07:52.740 --> 07:57.740\n Is there ways in which mathematics can lead us astray\n\n07:57.820 --> 08:01.500\n when we use it as a tool to understand the physical world?\n\n08:01.500 --> 08:04.580\n Yes, I would say that mathematics can lead us astray\n\n08:04.580 --> 08:08.260\n as much as old physical ideas can lead us astray.\n\n08:08.260 --> 08:11.700\n So if you get stuck in something,\n\n08:11.700 --> 08:13.300\n then you can easily fool yourself\n\n08:13.300 --> 08:15.540\n that just like the thought process,\n\n08:15.540 --> 08:17.300\n we have to free ourselves of that.\n\n08:17.300 --> 08:19.060\n Sometimes math does that role, like say,\n\n08:19.060 --> 08:20.580\n oh, this is such a beautiful math.\n\n08:20.580 --> 08:22.020\n I definitely want to use it somewhere.\n\n08:22.020 --> 08:23.820\n And so you just get carried away\n\n08:23.820 --> 08:25.760\n and you just get maybe carried too far away.\n\n08:25.760 --> 08:28.200\n So that is certainly true, but I wouldn't say\n\n08:28.200 --> 08:30.620\n it's more dangerous than old physical ideas.\n\n08:30.620 --> 08:34.420\n To me, new math ideas is as much potential\n\n08:34.420 --> 08:36.380\n to lead us astray as old physical ideas,\n\n08:36.380 --> 08:38.780\n which could be long held principles of physics.\n\n08:38.780 --> 08:41.860\n So I'm just saying that we should keep an open mind\n\n08:41.860 --> 08:43.900\n about the role the math plays,\n\n08:43.900 --> 08:46.020\n not to be antagonistic towards it\n\n08:46.020 --> 08:48.980\n and not to over, over welcoming it.\n\n08:48.980 --> 08:51.060\n We should just be open to possibilities.\n\n08:51.060 --> 08:53.660\n What about looking at a particular characteristics\n\n08:53.660 --> 08:55.700\n of both physical ideas and mathematical ideas,\n\n08:55.700 --> 08:56.820\n which is beauty?\n\n08:56.820 --> 09:00.060\n You think beauty leads us astray, meaning,\n\n09:00.060 --> 09:03.180\n and you offline showed me a really nice puzzle\n\n09:03.180 --> 09:06.380\n that illustrates this idea a little bit.\n\n09:06.380 --> 09:09.020\n Now, maybe you can speak to that or another example\n\n09:09.020 --> 09:13.540\n where beauty makes it tempting for us to assume\n\n09:13.540 --> 09:16.360\n that the law and the theory we found\n\n09:16.360 --> 09:19.740\n is actually one that perfectly describes reality.\n\n09:19.740 --> 09:22.820\n I think that beauty does not lead us astray\n\n09:22.820 --> 09:25.920\n because I feel that beauty is a requirement\n\n09:25.920 --> 09:27.740\n for principles of physics.\n\n09:27.740 --> 09:29.580\n So beauty is a fundamental in the universe?\n\n09:29.580 --> 09:30.900\n I think beauty is fundamental.\n\n09:30.900 --> 09:32.740\n At least that's the way many of us view it.\n\n09:32.740 --> 09:33.940\n It's not emergent.\n\n09:33.940 --> 09:35.140\n It's not emergent.\n\n09:35.140 --> 09:37.740\n I think Hardy is the mathematician who said\n\n09:37.740 --> 09:40.820\n that there's no permanent place for ugly mathematics.\n\n09:40.820 --> 09:42.940\n And so I think the same is true in physics\n\n09:42.940 --> 09:46.860\n that if we find the principle which looks ugly,\n\n09:47.900 --> 09:49.660\n we are not going to be, that's not the end stage.\n\n09:49.660 --> 09:52.040\n So therefore beauty is going to lead us somewhere.\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:54.840\n Now, it doesn't mean beauty is enough.\n\n09:54.840 --> 09:56.500\n It doesn't mean if you just have beauty,\n\n09:56.500 --> 09:58.980\n if I just look at something is beautiful, then I'm fine.\n\n09:58.980 --> 10:00.260\n No, that's not the case.\n\n10:00.260 --> 10:03.460\n Beauty is certainly a criteria that every good\n\n10:03.460 --> 10:04.500\n physical theory should pass.\n\n10:04.500 --> 10:06.500\n That's at least the view we have.\n\n10:06.500 --> 10:08.260\n Why do we have this view?\n\n10:08.260 --> 10:09.760\n That's a good question.\n\n10:09.760 --> 10:13.340\n It is partly, you could say, based on experience\n\n10:13.340 --> 10:17.060\n of science over centuries, partly is philosophical view\n\n10:17.060 --> 10:20.080\n of what reality is or should be.\n\n10:20.080 --> 10:23.780\n And in principle, it could have been ugly\n\n10:23.780 --> 10:25.540\n and we might have had to deal with it,\n\n10:25.540 --> 10:29.520\n but we have gotten maybe confident through examples\n\n10:29.520 --> 10:32.460\n in the history of science to look for beauty.\n\n10:32.460 --> 10:34.300\n And our sense of beauty seems to incorporate\n\n10:34.300 --> 10:36.040\n a lot of things that are essential for us\n\n10:36.040 --> 10:37.980\n to solve some difficult problems like symmetry.\n\n10:37.980 --> 10:39.340\n We find symmetry beautiful\n\n10:39.340 --> 10:41.260\n and the breaking of symmetry beautiful.\n\n10:41.260 --> 10:45.420\n Somehow symmetry is a fundamental part\n\n10:45.420 --> 10:50.020\n of how we conceive of beauty at all layers of reality,\n\n10:50.020 --> 10:51.220\n which is interesting.\n\n10:51.220 --> 10:55.220\n Like in both the visual space, like the way we look at art,\n\n10:55.220 --> 10:57.140\n we look at each other as human beings,\n\n10:57.140 --> 10:59.780\n the way we look at creatures in the biological space,\n\n10:59.780 --> 11:01.220\n the way we look at chemistry,\n\n11:01.220 --> 11:04.420\n and then into the physics world as the work you do.\n\n11:04.420 --> 11:05.420\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n11:05.420 --> 11:07.060\n It makes you wonder like,\n\n11:08.500 --> 11:10.020\n which one is the chicken or the egg?\n\n11:10.020 --> 11:13.100\n Is symmetry the chicken and our conception of beauty\n\n11:13.100 --> 11:15.340\n the egg or the other way around?\n\n11:15.340 --> 11:20.340\n Or somehow the fact that the symmetry is part of reality,\n\n11:20.900 --> 11:24.220\n it somehow creates a brain that then is able to perceive it.\n\n11:24.220 --> 11:27.060\n Or maybe this is just because we,\n\n11:27.060 --> 11:32.060\n maybe it's so obvious, it's almost trivial,\n\n11:32.300 --> 11:33.540\n that symmetry, of course,\n\n11:33.540 --> 11:36.400\n will be part of every kind of universe that's possible.\n\n11:37.940 --> 11:40.980\n And then any kind of organism that's able to observe\n\n11:40.980 --> 11:44.340\n that universe is going to appreciate symmetry.\n\n11:44.340 --> 11:46.060\n Well, these are good questions.\n\n11:46.060 --> 11:47.380\n We don't have a deep understanding\n\n11:47.380 --> 11:49.740\n of why we get attracted to symmetry.\n\n11:49.740 --> 11:54.500\n Why do laws of nature seem to have symmetries underlying\n\n11:54.500 --> 11:57.900\n them and the reasoning or the examples of whether,\n\n11:57.900 --> 11:58.980\n if there wasn't symmetry,\n\n11:58.980 --> 12:00.740\n we would have understood it or not.\n\n12:00.740 --> 12:02.820\n We could have said that, yeah, if there were, you know,\n\n12:02.820 --> 12:04.060\n things which didn't look that great,\n\n12:04.060 --> 12:04.900\n we could understand them.\n\n12:04.900 --> 12:08.060\n For example, we know that symmetries get broken\n\n12:08.060 --> 12:10.300\n and we have appreciated nature\n\n12:10.300 --> 12:12.420\n in the broken symmetry phase as well.\n\n12:12.420 --> 12:14.300\n The world we live in has many things\n\n12:14.300 --> 12:16.140\n which do not look symmetric,\n\n12:16.140 --> 12:18.940\n but even those have underlying symmetry\n\n12:18.940 --> 12:20.640\n when you look at it more deeply.\n\n12:20.640 --> 12:23.080\n So we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps\n\n12:23.080 --> 12:25.940\n by the appearance of symmetry all over the place.\n\n12:25.940 --> 12:26.980\n And we look for it.\n\n12:26.980 --> 12:31.940\n And I think this is perhaps related to a sense of aesthetics\n\n12:31.940 --> 12:33.340\n that scientists have.\n\n12:33.340 --> 12:36.780\n And we don't usually talk about it among scientists.\n\n12:36.780 --> 12:39.540\n In fact, it's kind of a philosophical view\n\n12:39.540 --> 12:43.240\n of why do we look for simplicity or beauty or so forth.\n\n12:43.240 --> 12:47.300\n And I think in a sense, scientists are a lot\n\n12:47.300 --> 12:48.900\n like philosophers.\n\n12:48.900 --> 12:51.180\n Sometimes I think, especially modern science\n\n12:51.180 --> 12:54.880\n seems to shun philosophers and philosophical views.\n\n12:54.880 --> 12:58.220\n And I think at their peril, I think in my view,\n\n12:58.220 --> 13:01.340\n science owes a lot to philosophy.\n\n13:01.340 --> 13:04.940\n And in my view, many scientists, in fact,\n\n13:04.940 --> 13:06.180\n probably all good scientists\n\n13:06.180 --> 13:08.840\n are perhaps amateur philosophers.\n\n13:08.840 --> 13:11.020\n They may not state that they are philosophers\n\n13:11.020 --> 13:13.400\n or they may not like to be labeled philosophers,\n\n13:13.400 --> 13:14.740\n but in many ways what they do\n\n13:14.740 --> 13:18.640\n is like what is philosophical takes of things.\n\n13:18.640 --> 13:20.340\n Looking for simplicity or symmetry\n\n13:20.340 --> 13:23.640\n is an example of that in my opinion, or seeing patterns.\n\n13:23.640 --> 13:26.660\n You see, for example, another example of the symmetry\n\n13:26.660 --> 13:29.420\n is like how you come up with new ideas in science.\n\n13:29.420 --> 13:31.900\n You see, for example, an idea A\n\n13:31.900 --> 13:33.660\n is connected with an idea B.\n\n13:33.660 --> 13:36.780\n Okay, so you study this connection very deeply.\n\n13:36.780 --> 13:39.300\n And then you find the cousin of an idea A,\n\n13:39.300 --> 13:41.140\n let me call it A prime.\n\n13:41.140 --> 13:44.060\n And then you immediately look for B prime.\n\n13:44.060 --> 13:46.260\n If A is like B and if there's an A prime,\n\n13:46.260 --> 13:47.340\n then you look for B prime.\n\n13:47.340 --> 13:48.180\n Why?\n\n13:48.180 --> 13:50.920\n Well, it completes the picture.\n\n13:50.920 --> 13:51.760\n Why?\n\n13:51.760 --> 13:53.180\n Well, it's philosophically appealing\n\n13:53.180 --> 13:55.300\n to have more balance in terms of that.\n\n13:55.300 --> 13:57.180\n And then you look for B prime and lo and behold,\n\n13:57.180 --> 13:58.580\n you find this other phenomenon,\n\n13:58.580 --> 14:01.160\n which is a physical phenomenon, which you call B prime.\n\n14:01.160 --> 14:03.580\n So this kind of thinking motivates\n\n14:03.580 --> 14:05.500\n asking questions and looking for things.\n\n14:05.500 --> 14:08.580\n And it has guided scientists, I think, through many centuries\n\n14:08.580 --> 14:10.860\n and I think it continues to do so today.\n\n14:10.860 --> 14:12.940\n And I think if you look at the long arc of history,\n\n14:12.940 --> 14:16.420\n I suspect that the things that will be remembered\n\n14:16.420 --> 14:21.420\n is the philosophical flavor of the ideas of physics\n\n14:21.460 --> 14:24.540\n and chemistry and computer science and mathematics.\n\n14:24.540 --> 14:29.300\n Like, I think the actual details\n\n14:29.300 --> 14:33.220\n will be shown to be incomplete or maybe wrong,\n\n14:33.220 --> 14:34.960\n but the philosophical intuitions\n\n14:34.960 --> 14:36.880\n will carry through much longer.\n\n14:36.880 --> 14:39.380\n There's a sense in which, if it's true,\n\n14:39.380 --> 14:43.140\n that we haven't figured out most of how things work,\n\n14:43.140 --> 14:47.140\n currently, that it'll all be shown as wrong and silly.\n\n14:47.140 --> 14:49.900\n It'd almost be a historical artifact.\n\n14:49.900 --> 14:52.660\n But the human spirit, whatever,\n\n14:52.660 --> 14:55.620\n like the longing to understand,\n\n14:55.620 --> 14:59.040\n the way we perceive the world, the way we conceive of it,\n\n14:59.040 --> 15:02.540\n of our place in the world, those ideas will carry on.\n\n15:02.540 --> 15:03.380\n I completely agree.\n\n15:03.380 --> 15:05.580\n In fact, I believe that almost,\n\n15:05.580 --> 15:08.220\n well, I believe that none of the principles\n\n15:08.220 --> 15:11.580\n or laws of physics we know today are exactly correct.\n\n15:11.580 --> 15:13.700\n All of them are approximations to something.\n\n15:13.700 --> 15:15.660\n They are better than the previous versions that we had,\n\n15:15.660 --> 15:17.740\n but none of them are exactly correct,\n\n15:17.740 --> 15:19.940\n and none of them are gonna stand forever.\n\n15:19.940 --> 15:22.780\n So I agree that that's the process we are heading,\n\n15:22.780 --> 15:24.100\n we are improving.\n\n15:24.100 --> 15:26.380\n And yes, indeed, the thought process\n\n15:26.380 --> 15:28.800\n and that philosophical take is common.\n\n15:28.800 --> 15:33.420\n So when we look at older scientists,\n\n15:33.420 --> 15:36.020\n or maybe even all the way back to Greek philosophers\n\n15:36.020 --> 15:38.140\n and the things that the way they thought and so on,\n\n15:38.140 --> 15:42.140\n almost everything they said about nature was incorrect.\n\n15:42.140 --> 15:43.900\n But the way they thought about it\n\n15:43.900 --> 15:45.860\n and many things that they were thinking\n\n15:45.860 --> 15:46.940\n is still valid today.\n\n15:46.940 --> 15:50.060\n For example, they thought about symmetry breaking.\n\n15:50.060 --> 15:51.960\n They were trying to explain the following.\n\n15:51.960 --> 15:53.660\n This is a beautiful example, I think.\n\n15:53.660 --> 15:55.900\n They had figured out that the Earth is round,\n\n15:55.900 --> 15:57.420\n and they said, okay, Earth is round.\n\n15:57.420 --> 16:01.300\n They have seen the length of the shadow of a meter stick,\n\n16:01.300 --> 16:02.500\n and they have seen that if you go\n\n16:02.500 --> 16:04.540\n from the equator upwards north,\n\n16:04.540 --> 16:06.460\n they find that depending on how far away you are,\n\n16:06.460 --> 16:07.900\n that the length of the shadow changes.\n\n16:07.900 --> 16:09.900\n And from that, they had even measured\n\n16:09.900 --> 16:12.260\n the radius of the Earth to good accuracy.\n\n16:12.260 --> 16:14.540\n That's brilliant, by the way, the fact that they did that.\n\n16:14.540 --> 16:15.660\n Very brilliant, very brilliant.\n\n16:15.660 --> 16:17.700\n So these Greek philosophers are very smart.\n\n16:17.700 --> 16:20.640\n And so they had taken it to the next step.\n\n16:20.640 --> 16:23.100\n They asked, okay, so the Earth is round,\n\n16:23.100 --> 16:24.200\n why doesn't it move?\n\n16:25.140 --> 16:26.260\n They thought it doesn't move.\n\n16:26.260 --> 16:28.540\n They were looking around, nothing seemed to move.\n\n16:28.540 --> 16:31.420\n So they said, okay, we have to have a good explanation.\n\n16:31.420 --> 16:33.300\n It wasn't enough for them to be there.\n\n16:33.300 --> 16:36.060\n So they really wanna deeply understand that fact.\n\n16:36.060 --> 16:38.660\n And they come up with a symmetry argument.\n\n16:38.660 --> 16:40.300\n And the symmetry argument was,\n\n16:40.300 --> 16:43.460\n oh, if the Earth is a spherical,\n\n16:43.460 --> 16:45.500\n it must be at the center of the universe for sure.\n\n16:45.500 --> 16:47.380\n So they said the Earth is at the center of the universe.\n\n16:47.380 --> 16:48.220\n That makes sense.\n\n16:48.220 --> 16:50.700\n And they said, if the Earth is going to move,\n\n16:50.700 --> 16:52.180\n which direction does it pick?\n\n16:52.180 --> 16:54.820\n Any direction it picks, it breaks that spherical symmetry\n\n16:54.820 --> 16:57.060\n because you have to pick a direction.\n\n16:57.060 --> 16:59.320\n And that's not good because it's not symmetrical anymore.\n\n16:59.320 --> 17:01.940\n So therefore, the Earth decides to sit put\n\n17:01.940 --> 17:03.940\n because it would break the symmetry.\n\n17:03.940 --> 17:05.760\n So they had the incorrect science.\n\n17:05.760 --> 17:07.260\n They thought Earth doesn't move.\n\n17:07.260 --> 17:08.660\n But they had this beautiful idea\n\n17:08.660 --> 17:10.200\n that symmetry might explain it.\n\n17:11.180 --> 17:12.620\n But they were even smarter than that.\n\n17:12.620 --> 17:14.820\n Aristotle didn't agree with this argument.\n\n17:15.940 --> 17:18.420\n He said, why do you think symmetry prevents it from moving?\n\n17:18.420 --> 17:19.920\n Because the preferred position?\n\n17:19.920 --> 17:21.340\n Not so.\n\n17:21.340 --> 17:22.300\n He gave an example.\n\n17:22.300 --> 17:26.100\n He said, suppose you are a person\n\n17:26.100 --> 17:28.300\n and we put you at the center of a circle\n\n17:29.380 --> 17:32.880\n and we spread food around you on a circle around you,\n\n17:32.880 --> 17:35.040\n loaves of bread, let's say.\n\n17:35.040 --> 17:39.080\n And we say, okay, stay at the center of the circle forever.\n\n17:39.080 --> 17:39.980\n Are you going to do that\n\n17:39.980 --> 17:41.820\n just because it's a symmetric point?\n\n17:43.220 --> 17:44.640\n No, you are going to get hungry.\n\n17:44.640 --> 17:46.940\n You're going to move towards one of those loaves of bread,\n\n17:46.940 --> 17:49.460\n despite the fact that it breaks the symmetry.\n\n17:49.460 --> 17:51.340\n So from this way, he tried to argue\n\n17:51.340 --> 17:52.640\n being at the symmetric point\n\n17:52.640 --> 17:55.360\n may not be the preferred thing to do.\n\n17:55.360 --> 17:57.560\n And this idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking\n\n17:57.560 --> 17:59.640\n is something we just use today\n\n17:59.640 --> 18:01.580\n to describe many physical phenomena.\n\n18:01.580 --> 18:03.600\n So spontaneous symmetry breaking\n\n18:03.600 --> 18:04.940\n is the feature that we now use.\n\n18:04.940 --> 18:08.040\n But this idea was there thousands of years ago,\n\n18:08.040 --> 18:11.040\n but applied incorrectly to the physical world,\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:12.000\n but now we are using it.\n\n18:12.000 --> 18:14.740\n So these ideas are coming back in different forms.\n\n18:14.740 --> 18:17.360\n So I agree very much that the thought process\n\n18:17.360 --> 18:20.000\n is more important and these ideas are more interesting\n\n18:20.000 --> 18:23.160\n than the actual applications that people may find today.\n\n18:23.160 --> 18:24.640\n Did they use the language of symmetry\n\n18:24.640 --> 18:26.840\n and the symmetry breaking and spontaneous symmetry breaking?\n\n18:26.840 --> 18:28.200\n That's really interesting.\n\n18:28.200 --> 18:32.500\n Because I could see a conception of the universe\n\n18:32.500 --> 18:35.200\n that kind of tends towards perfect symmetry\n\n18:35.200 --> 18:38.540\n and is stuck there, not stuck there,\n\n18:38.540 --> 18:42.100\n but achieves that optimal and stays there.\n\n18:42.100 --> 18:43.800\n The idea that you would spontaneously\n\n18:43.800 --> 18:47.920\n break out of symmetry, like have these perturbations,\n\n18:47.920 --> 18:51.160\n like jump out of symmetry and back,\n\n18:51.160 --> 18:55.320\n that's a really difficult idea to load into your head.\n\n18:55.320 --> 18:57.320\n Like where does that come from?\n\n18:57.320 --> 18:59.940\n And then the idea that you may not be\n\n18:59.940 --> 19:02.420\n at the center of the universe.\n\n19:02.420 --> 19:04.920\n That is a really tough idea.\n\n19:04.920 --> 19:07.320\n Right, so symmetry sometimes is an explanation\n\n19:07.320 --> 19:08.920\n of being at the symmetric point.\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:10.920\n It's sometimes a simple explanation of many things.\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:15.520\n Like if you have a bowl, a circular bowl,\n\n19:15.520 --> 19:18.120\n then the bottom of it is the lowest point.\n\n19:18.120 --> 19:19.760\n So if you put a pebble or something,\n\n19:19.760 --> 19:21.560\n it will slide down and go there at the bottom\n\n19:21.560 --> 19:23.720\n and stays there at the symmetric point\n\n19:23.720 --> 19:26.400\n because it's the preferred point, the lowest energy point.\n\n19:26.400 --> 19:29.260\n But if that same symmetric circular bowl that you had\n\n19:29.260 --> 19:33.600\n had a bump on the bottom, the bottom might not be\n\n19:33.600 --> 19:36.920\n at the center, it might be on a circle on the table,\n\n19:36.920 --> 19:39.320\n in which case the pebble would not end up at the center,\n\n19:39.320 --> 19:40.880\n it would be the lower energy point.\n\n19:40.880 --> 19:43.000\n Symmetrical, but it breaks the symmetry\n\n19:43.000 --> 19:45.200\n once it takes a point on that circle.\n\n19:45.200 --> 19:48.920\n So we can have symmetry reasoning for where things end up\n\n19:48.920 --> 19:52.740\n or symmetry breakings, like this example would suggest.\n\n19:52.740 --> 19:54.500\n We talked about beauty.\n\n19:54.500 --> 19:56.640\n I find geometry to be beautiful.\n\n19:56.640 --> 20:01.640\n You have a few examples that are geometric\n\n20:01.880 --> 20:04.500\n in nature in your book.\n\n20:04.500 --> 20:06.840\n How can geometry in ancient times or today\n\n20:06.840 --> 20:09.520\n be used to understand reality?\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:12.600\n And maybe how do you think about geometry\n\n20:12.600 --> 20:17.540\n as a distinct tool in mathematics and physics?\n\n20:17.540 --> 20:19.960\n Yes, geometry is my favorite part of math as well.\n\n20:19.960 --> 20:22.480\n And Greeks were enamored by geometry.\n\n20:22.480 --> 20:25.680\n They tried to describe physical reality using geometry\n\n20:25.680 --> 20:27.980\n and principles of geometry and symmetry.\n\n20:27.980 --> 20:31.240\n Platonic solids, the five solids they had discovered\n\n20:31.240 --> 20:33.200\n had these beautiful solids.\n\n20:33.200 --> 20:35.560\n They thought it must be good for some reality.\n\n20:35.560 --> 20:37.000\n There must be explaining something.\n\n20:37.000 --> 20:40.720\n They attached one to air, one to fire and so forth.\n\n20:40.720 --> 20:44.440\n They tried to give physical reality to symmetric objects.\n\n20:45.360 --> 20:48.600\n These symmetric objects are symmetries of rotation\n\n20:48.600 --> 20:50.760\n and discrete symmetry groups we call today\n\n20:50.760 --> 20:53.400\n of rotation group in three dimensions.\n\n20:53.400 --> 20:56.240\n Now, we know now, we kind of laugh at the way\n\n20:56.240 --> 20:57.960\n they were trying to connect that symmetry\n\n20:57.960 --> 21:02.040\n to the laws of the realities of physics.\n\n21:02.040 --> 21:05.840\n But actually it turns out in modern days,\n\n21:05.840 --> 21:08.840\n we use symmetries in not too far away\n\n21:09.880 --> 21:12.440\n exactly in these kinds of thoughts processes\n\n21:12.440 --> 21:14.120\n in the following way.\n\n21:14.120 --> 21:16.420\n In the context of string theory,\n\n21:16.420 --> 21:18.640\n which is the field light study,\n\n21:18.640 --> 21:20.840\n we have these extra dimensions.\n\n21:20.840 --> 21:24.040\n And these extra dimensions are compact tiny spaces typically\n\n21:24.040 --> 21:26.040\n but they have different shapes and sizes.\n\n21:27.260 --> 21:30.200\n We have learned that if these extra shapes and sizes\n\n21:30.200 --> 21:32.400\n have symmetries, which are related\n\n21:32.400 --> 21:34.160\n to the same rotation symmetries\n\n21:34.160 --> 21:36.200\n that the Greek we're talking about,\n\n21:36.200 --> 21:38.560\n if they enjoy those discrete symmetries\n\n21:38.560 --> 21:41.760\n and if you take that symmetry and caution the space by it,\n\n21:41.760 --> 21:44.540\n in other words, identify points under these symmetries,\n\n21:44.540 --> 21:48.520\n you get properties of that space at the singular points\n\n21:48.520 --> 21:51.360\n which force emanates from them.\n\n21:51.360 --> 21:52.240\n What forces?\n\n21:52.240 --> 21:54.960\n Forces like the ones we have seen in nature today,\n\n21:54.960 --> 21:59.080\n like electric forces, like strong forces, like weak forces.\n\n21:59.080 --> 22:02.880\n So these same principles that were driving them\n\n22:02.880 --> 22:06.600\n to connect geometry and symmetries to nature\n\n22:06.600 --> 22:10.440\n is driving today's physics,\n\n22:10.440 --> 22:13.920\n now much more modern ideas, but nevertheless,\n\n22:13.920 --> 22:17.040\n the symmetries connecting geometry to physics.\n\n22:17.040 --> 22:20.560\n In fact, often sometimes we ask the following question,\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:24.680\n suppose I want to get this particular physical reality,\n\n22:24.680 --> 22:27.420\n I wanna have this particles with these forces and so on,\n\n22:27.420 --> 22:28.800\n what do I do?\n\n22:28.800 --> 22:31.480\n It turns out that you can geometrically design\n\n22:31.480 --> 22:33.160\n the space to give you that.\n\n22:33.160 --> 22:35.400\n You say, oh, I put the sphere here, I will do this,\n\n22:35.400 --> 22:36.680\n I will shrink them.\n\n22:36.680 --> 22:39.540\n So if you have two spheres touching each other\n\n22:39.540 --> 22:43.900\n and shrinking to zero size, that gives you strong forces.\n\n22:43.900 --> 22:45.720\n If you have one of them, it gives you the weak forces.\n\n22:45.720 --> 22:46.840\n If you have this, you get that.\n\n22:46.840 --> 22:49.040\n And if you want to unify forces, do the other thing.\n\n22:49.040 --> 22:52.840\n So these geometrical translation of physics\n\n22:52.840 --> 22:54.880\n is one of my favorite things that we have discovered\n\n22:54.880 --> 22:57.600\n in modern physics and the context of string theory.\n\n22:57.600 --> 22:59.840\n The sad thing is when you go into multiple dimensions\n\n22:59.840 --> 23:04.840\n and we'll talk about it is we start to lose our capacity\n\n23:05.040 --> 23:09.560\n to visually intuit the world we're discussing.\n\n23:09.560 --> 23:11.680\n And then we go into the realm of mathematics\n\n23:11.680 --> 23:12.760\n and we'll lose that.\n\n23:12.760 --> 23:15.720\n Unfortunately, our brains are such that we're limited.\n\n23:15.720 --> 23:19.880\n But before we go into that mysterious, beautiful world,\n\n23:19.880 --> 23:21.440\n let's take a small step back.\n\n23:21.440 --> 23:23.760\n And you also in your book have this kind of\n\n23:24.760 --> 23:27.280\n through the space of puzzles, through the space of ideas,\n\n23:27.280 --> 23:32.000\n have a brief history of physics, of physical ideas.\n\n23:32.000 --> 23:35.680\n Now, we talked about Newtonian mechanics leading all\n\n23:35.680 --> 23:38.960\n through different Lagrangian, Hamiltonian mechanics.\n\n23:38.960 --> 23:41.160\n Can you describe some of the key ideas\n\n23:41.160 --> 23:42.840\n in the history of physics?\n\n23:42.840 --> 23:46.960\n Maybe lingering on each from electromagnetism to relativity\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:49.640\n to quantum mechanics and to today,\n\n23:49.640 --> 23:52.760\n as we'll talk about with quantum gravity and string theory.\n\n23:52.760 --> 23:55.880\n Sure, so I mentioned the classical mechanics\n\n23:55.880 --> 23:57.760\n and the Euler Lagrangian formulation.\n\n23:59.440 --> 24:03.200\n One of the next important milestones for physics\n\n24:03.200 --> 24:07.240\n were the discoveries of laws of electricity and magnetism.\n\n24:07.240 --> 24:10.520\n So Maxwell put the discoveries all together\n\n24:10.520 --> 24:13.600\n in the context of what we call the Maxwell's equations.\n\n24:13.600 --> 24:16.880\n And he noticed that when he put these discoveries\n\n24:16.880 --> 24:20.560\n that Faraday's and others had made about electric\n\n24:20.560 --> 24:23.640\n and magnetic phenomena in terms of mathematical equations,\n\n24:23.640 --> 24:25.240\n it didn't quite work.\n\n24:25.240 --> 24:27.800\n There was a mathematical inconsistency.\n\n24:27.800 --> 24:31.240\n Now, one could have had two attitudes.\n\n24:31.240 --> 24:32.760\n One would say, okay, who cares about math?\n\n24:32.760 --> 24:35.400\n I'm doing nature, electric force, magnetic force,\n\n24:35.400 --> 24:36.840\n math I don't care about.\n\n24:36.840 --> 24:37.920\n But it bothered him.\n\n24:37.920 --> 24:39.000\n It was inconsistent.\n\n24:39.000 --> 24:40.760\n The equations he were writing, the two equations\n\n24:40.760 --> 24:43.320\n he had written down did not agree with each other.\n\n24:43.320 --> 24:45.280\n And this bothered him, but he figured out,\n\n24:45.280 --> 24:47.360\n if you add this jiggle, this equation\n\n24:47.360 --> 24:50.040\n by adding one little term there, it works.\n\n24:50.040 --> 24:51.520\n At least it's consistent.\n\n24:51.520 --> 24:53.400\n What is the motivation for that term?\n\n24:53.400 --> 24:54.480\n He said, I don't know.\n\n24:54.480 --> 24:56.040\n Have we seen it in experiments?\n\n24:56.040 --> 24:57.200\n No.\n\n24:57.200 --> 24:58.040\n Why did you add it?\n\n24:58.040 --> 24:59.800\n Well, because of mathematical consistency.\n\n24:59.800 --> 25:04.520\n So he said, okay, math forced him to do this term.\n\n25:04.520 --> 25:08.200\n He added this term, which we now today call the Maxwell term.\n\n25:08.200 --> 25:11.280\n And once he added that term, his equations were nice,\n\n25:11.280 --> 25:13.520\n differential equations, mathematically consistent,\n\n25:13.520 --> 25:17.120\n beautiful, but he also found the new physical phenomena.\n\n25:17.120 --> 25:19.000\n He found that because of that term,\n\n25:19.000 --> 25:22.520\n he could now get electric and magnetic waves\n\n25:22.520 --> 25:27.280\n moving through space at a speed that he could calculate.\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:29.560\n So he calculated the speed of the wave\n\n25:29.560 --> 25:31.160\n and lo and behold, he found it's the same\n\n25:31.160 --> 25:33.440\n as the speed of light, which puzzled him\n\n25:33.440 --> 25:35.240\n because he didn't think light had anything\n\n25:35.240 --> 25:37.760\n to do with electricity and magnetism.\n\n25:37.760 --> 25:39.400\n But then he was courageous enough to say,\n\n25:39.400 --> 25:40.920\n well, maybe light is nothing\n\n25:40.920 --> 25:43.560\n but these electric and magnetic fields moving around.\n\n25:44.520 --> 25:48.920\n And he wasn't alive to see the verification\n\n25:48.920 --> 25:50.400\n of that prediction and indeed it was true.\n\n25:50.400 --> 25:53.440\n So this mathematical inconsistency,\n\n25:53.440 --> 25:58.240\n which we could say this mathematical beauty drove him\n\n25:58.240 --> 26:02.320\n to this physical, very important connection\n\n26:02.320 --> 26:05.080\n between light and electric and magnetic phenomena,\n\n26:05.080 --> 26:07.520\n which was later confirmed.\n\n26:07.520 --> 26:11.080\n So then physics progresses and it comes to Einstein.\n\n26:11.080 --> 26:13.480\n Einstein looks at Maxwell's equation,\n\n26:13.480 --> 26:15.120\n says, beautiful, these are nice equation,\n\n26:15.120 --> 26:17.680\n except we get one speed light.\n\n26:18.640 --> 26:20.480\n Who measures this light speed?\n\n26:20.480 --> 26:23.480\n And he asked the question, are you moving?\n\n26:23.480 --> 26:24.320\n Are you not moving?\n\n26:24.320 --> 26:25.760\n If you move, the speed of light changes,\n\n26:25.760 --> 26:27.720\n but Maxwell's equation has no hint\n\n26:27.720 --> 26:29.360\n of different speeds of light.\n\n26:29.360 --> 26:31.680\n It doesn't say, oh, only if you're not moving,\n\n26:31.680 --> 26:33.600\n you get the speed, it's just you always get the speed.\n\n26:33.600 --> 26:37.320\n So Einstein was very puzzled and he was daring enough\n\n26:37.320 --> 26:39.120\n to say, well, you know, maybe everybody gets\n\n26:39.120 --> 26:40.960\n the same speed for light.\n\n26:40.960 --> 26:44.360\n And that motivated his theory of special relativity.\n\n26:44.360 --> 26:45.720\n And this is an interesting example\n\n26:45.720 --> 26:47.760\n because the idea was motivated from physics,\n\n26:47.760 --> 26:50.080\n from Maxwell's equations, from the fact\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:55.080\n that people try to measure the properties of ether,\n\n26:56.720 --> 26:58.760\n which was supposed to be the medium\n\n26:58.760 --> 27:00.720\n in which the light travels through.\n\n27:00.720 --> 27:03.920\n And the idea was that only in that medium,\n\n27:03.920 --> 27:06.520\n the speed of, if you're at risk with respect\n\n27:06.520 --> 27:08.560\n to the ether, the speed, the speed of light,\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:10.480\n then if you're moving, the speed changes\n\n27:10.480 --> 27:11.920\n and people did not discover it.\n\n27:11.920 --> 27:15.040\n Michelson and Morley's experiment showed there's no ether.\n\n27:15.040 --> 27:17.560\n So then Einstein was courageous enough to say,\n\n27:17.560 --> 27:20.120\n you know, light is the same speed for everybody,\n\n27:20.120 --> 27:22.440\n regardless of whether you're moving or not.\n\n27:22.440 --> 27:25.760\n And the interesting thing is about special theory\n\n27:25.760 --> 27:29.880\n of relativity is that the math underpinning it\n\n27:29.880 --> 27:31.320\n is very simple.\n\n27:31.320 --> 27:35.640\n It's a linear algebra, nothing terribly deep.\n\n27:35.640 --> 27:38.680\n You can teach it at a high school level, if not earlier.\n\n27:39.560 --> 27:42.560\n Okay, does that mean Einstein's special relativity\n\n27:42.560 --> 27:43.400\n is boring?\n\n27:43.400 --> 27:44.560\n Not at all.\n\n27:44.560 --> 27:47.280\n So this is an example where simple math, you know,\n\n27:47.280 --> 27:50.880\n linear algebra leads to deep physics.\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:53.080\n Einstein's theory of special relativity.\n\n27:53.080 --> 27:56.640\n Motivated by this inconsistency that Maxwell's equation\n\n27:56.640 --> 27:58.080\n would suggest for the speed of light,\n\n27:58.080 --> 27:59.080\n depending on who observes it.\n\n27:59.080 --> 28:00.720\n What's the most daring idea there,\n\n28:00.720 --> 28:03.880\n that the speed of light could be the same everywhere?\n\n28:03.880 --> 28:05.720\n That's the basic, that's the guts of it.\n\n28:05.720 --> 28:07.080\n That's the core of Einstein's theory.\n\n28:07.080 --> 28:09.480\n That statement underlies the whole thing.\n\n28:09.480 --> 28:11.040\n Speed of light is the same for everybody.\n\n28:11.040 --> 28:13.360\n It's hard to swallow and it doesn't sound right.\n\n28:13.360 --> 28:16.320\n It sounds completely wrong on the face of it.\n\n28:16.320 --> 28:19.960\n And it took Einstein to make this daring statement.\n\n28:19.960 --> 28:22.560\n It would be laughing in some sense.\n\n28:22.560 --> 28:26.520\n How could anybody make this possibly ridiculous claim?\n\n28:26.520 --> 28:27.720\n And it turned out to be true.\n\n28:27.720 --> 28:28.880\n How does that make you feel?\n\n28:28.880 --> 28:31.400\n Because it still sounds ridiculous.\n\n28:31.400 --> 28:33.080\n It sounds ridiculous until you learn\n\n28:33.080 --> 28:34.960\n that our intuition is at fault\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:37.560\n about the way we conceive of space and time.\n\n28:37.560 --> 28:40.120\n The way we think about space and time is wrong\n\n28:40.120 --> 28:43.360\n because we think about the nature of time as absolute.\n\n28:43.360 --> 28:46.720\n And part of it is because we live in a situation\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:49.400\n where we don't go with very high speeds.\n\n28:49.400 --> 28:50.480\n There are speeds that are small\n\n28:50.480 --> 28:52.000\n compared to the speed of light.\n\n28:52.000 --> 28:54.760\n And therefore the phenomena we observe\n\n28:54.760 --> 28:57.440\n does not distinguish the relativity of time.\n\n28:57.440 --> 28:59.200\n The time also depends on who measures it.\n\n28:59.200 --> 29:00.800\n There's no absolute time.\n\n29:00.800 --> 29:02.880\n When you say it's noon today and now,\n\n29:02.880 --> 29:04.360\n it depends on who's measuring it.\n\n29:04.360 --> 29:07.000\n And not everybody would agree with that statement.\n\n29:07.000 --> 29:10.520\n And to see that you would have to have fast observer\n\n29:10.520 --> 29:12.720\n moving speeds close to the speed of light.\n\n29:12.720 --> 29:15.760\n So this shows that our intuition is at fault.\n\n29:15.760 --> 29:19.320\n And a lot of the discoveries in physics\n\n29:19.320 --> 29:23.640\n precisely is getting rid of the wrong old intuition.\n\n29:23.640 --> 29:25.960\n And it is funny because we get rid of it,\n\n29:25.960 --> 29:28.200\n but it's always lingers in us in some form.\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:30.000\n Like even when I'm describing it,\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:32.960\n I feel like a little bit like, isn't it funny?\n\n29:32.960 --> 29:34.480\n As you're just feeling the same way.\n\n29:34.480 --> 29:35.800\n It is, it is.\n\n29:35.800 --> 29:40.600\n But we kind of replace it by an intuition.\n\n29:40.600 --> 29:43.440\n And actually there's a very beautiful example of this,\n\n29:43.440 --> 29:46.040\n how physicists do this, try to replace their intuition.\n\n29:46.040 --> 29:48.400\n And I think this is one of my favorite examples\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:51.240\n about how physicists develop intuition.\n\n29:52.160 --> 29:54.960\n It goes to the work of Galileo.\n\n29:54.960 --> 29:58.600\n So, again, let's go back to Greek philosophers\n\n29:58.600 --> 30:00.520\n or maybe Aristotle in this case.\n\n30:00.520 --> 30:02.560\n Now, again, let's make a criticism.\n\n30:02.560 --> 30:05.880\n He thought that the heavier objects fall faster\n\n30:05.880 --> 30:07.000\n than the lighter objects.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:07.880\n Makes sense.\n\n30:07.880 --> 30:08.840\n It kind of makes sense.\n\n30:08.840 --> 30:10.960\n And people say about the feather and so on,\n\n30:10.960 --> 30:12.680\n but that's because of the air resistance.\n\n30:12.680 --> 30:13.640\n But you might think like,\n\n30:13.640 --> 30:17.000\n if you have a heavy stone and a light pebble,\n\n30:17.000 --> 30:18.480\n the heavy one will fall first.\n\n30:18.480 --> 30:20.280\n If you don't do any experiments,\n\n30:20.280 --> 30:21.480\n that's the first gut reaction.\n\n30:21.480 --> 30:24.080\n I would say everybody would say that's the natural thing.\n\n30:24.080 --> 30:25.560\n Galileo did not believe this.\n\n30:25.560 --> 30:29.880\n And he kind of did the experiment.\n\n30:29.880 --> 30:32.640\n Famously it said he went on the top of Pisa Tower\n\n30:32.640 --> 30:34.680\n and he dropped these heavy and light stones\n\n30:34.680 --> 30:35.800\n and they fell at the same time\n\n30:35.800 --> 30:39.000\n when he dropped it at the same time from the same height.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:39.920\n Okay, good.\n\n30:39.920 --> 30:41.400\n So he said, I'm done.\n\n30:41.400 --> 30:43.640\n I've showed that the heavy and lighter objects\n\n30:43.640 --> 30:44.480\n fall at the same time.\n\n30:44.480 --> 30:45.840\n I did the experiment.\n\n30:45.840 --> 30:49.440\n Scientists at that time did not accept it.\n\n30:49.440 --> 30:50.760\n Why was that?\n\n30:50.760 --> 30:54.240\n Because at that time, science was not just experimental.\n\n30:54.240 --> 30:56.720\n The experiment was not enough.\n\n30:56.720 --> 30:59.560\n They didn't think that they have to soil their hands\n\n30:59.560 --> 31:01.840\n in doing experiments to get to the reality.\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:03.320\n They said, why is it the case?\n\n31:03.320 --> 31:04.160\n Why?\n\n31:04.160 --> 31:06.360\n So Galileo had to come up with an explanation\n\n31:06.360 --> 31:09.520\n of why heavier and lighter objects fall at the same rate.\n\n31:09.520 --> 31:13.240\n This is the way he convinced them using symmetry.\n\n31:13.240 --> 31:16.120\n He said, suppose you have three bricks,\n\n31:16.120 --> 31:21.120\n the same shape, the same size, same mass, everything.\n\n31:21.120 --> 31:24.880\n And we hold these three bricks at the same height\n\n31:24.880 --> 31:25.720\n and drop them.\n\n31:27.080 --> 31:29.960\n Which one will fall to the ground first?\n\n31:29.960 --> 31:32.080\n Everybody said, of course, we know it's symmetry\n\n31:32.080 --> 31:33.840\n tells you they're all the same shape,\n\n31:33.840 --> 31:35.240\n same size, same height.\n\n31:35.240 --> 31:36.800\n Of course, they fall at the same time.\n\n31:36.800 --> 31:37.640\n Yeah, we know that.\n\n31:37.640 --> 31:38.680\n Next, next.\n\n31:38.680 --> 31:39.880\n It's trivial.\n\n31:39.880 --> 31:42.000\n He said, okay, what if we move these bricks around\n\n31:42.000 --> 31:42.840\n with the same height?\n\n31:42.840 --> 31:45.160\n Does it change the time they hit the ground?\n\n31:45.160 --> 31:46.320\n They said, if it's the same height,\n\n31:46.320 --> 31:47.800\n again, by the symmetry principle,\n\n31:47.800 --> 31:49.360\n because the height translation horizontal\n\n31:49.360 --> 31:52.200\n translates to the symmetry, no, it doesn't matter.\n\n31:52.200 --> 31:53.560\n They all fall at the same rate.\n\n31:53.560 --> 31:54.400\n Good.\n\n31:54.400 --> 31:55.840\n Does it matter how close I bring them together?\n\n31:55.840 --> 31:56.920\n No, it doesn't.\n\n31:56.920 --> 31:59.040\n Okay, suppose I make the two bricks touch\n\n31:59.040 --> 31:59.880\n and then let them go.\n\n31:59.880 --> 32:01.120\n Do they fall at the same rate?\n\n32:01.120 --> 32:02.560\n Yes, they do.\n\n32:02.560 --> 32:04.920\n But then he said, well, the two bricks that touch\n\n32:04.920 --> 32:07.160\n are twice more mass than this other brick.\n\n32:07.160 --> 32:09.640\n And you just agreed that they fall at the same rate.\n\n32:09.640 --> 32:10.760\n They say, yeah, yeah, we just agreed.\n\n32:10.760 --> 32:12.440\n That's right, that's great.\n\n32:12.440 --> 32:13.280\n Yes.\n\n32:13.280 --> 32:15.440\n So he deconfused them by the symmetry reasoning.\n\n32:15.440 --> 32:18.320\n So this way of repackaging some intuition,\n\n32:18.320 --> 32:19.840\n a different type of intuition.\n\n32:19.840 --> 32:21.920\n When the intuitions clash,\n\n32:21.920 --> 32:24.920\n then you side on the, you replace the intuition.\n\n32:24.920 --> 32:25.920\n That's brilliant.\n\n32:26.960 --> 32:31.280\n In some of these more difficult physical ideas,\n\n32:31.280 --> 32:34.200\n physics ideas in the 20th century and the 21st century,\n\n32:34.200 --> 32:36.120\n it starts becoming more and more difficult\n\n32:36.120 --> 32:38.320\n to then replace the intuition.\n\n32:38.320 --> 32:39.840\n What does the world look like\n\n32:39.840 --> 32:42.840\n for an object traveling close to the speed of light?\n\n32:42.840 --> 32:44.960\n You start to think about the edges\n\n32:44.960 --> 32:47.480\n of supermassive black holes,\n\n32:47.480 --> 32:51.000\n and you start to think like, what's that look like?\n\n32:51.000 --> 32:54.640\n Or I've been into gravitational waves recently.\n\n32:55.720 --> 32:58.040\n It's like when the fabric of space time\n\n32:58.040 --> 33:01.400\n is being morphed by gravity,\n\n33:01.400 --> 33:03.400\n like what's that actually feel like?\n\n33:03.400 --> 33:06.880\n If I'm riding a gravitational wave, what's that feel like?\n\n33:09.080 --> 33:12.160\n I mean, I think some of those are more sort of hippy,\n\n33:12.160 --> 33:15.800\n not useful intuitions to have,\n\n33:15.800 --> 33:18.720\n but if you're an actual physicist\n\n33:18.720 --> 33:20.560\n or whatever the particular discipline is,\n\n33:20.560 --> 33:23.520\n I wonder if it's possible to meditate,\n\n33:23.520 --> 33:26.640\n to sort of escape through thinking,\n\n33:27.520 --> 33:31.720\n prolong thinking and meditation on a world,\n\n33:31.720 --> 33:35.280\n like live in a visualized world that's not like our own\n\n33:35.280 --> 33:38.080\n in order to understand a phenomenon deeply.\n\n33:38.080 --> 33:39.960\n So like replace the intuition,\n\n33:41.440 --> 33:44.560\n like through rigorous meditation on the idea\n\n33:44.560 --> 33:46.360\n in order to conceive of it.\n\n33:46.360 --> 33:48.720\n I mean, if we talk about multiple dimensions,\n\n33:48.720 --> 33:51.600\n I wonder if there's a way to escape\n\n33:51.600 --> 33:53.920\n with a three dimensional world in our mind\n\n33:53.920 --> 33:56.280\n in order to then start to reason about it.\n\n33:56.280 --> 33:59.040\n It's, the more I talk to topologists,\n\n34:01.200 --> 34:04.280\n the more they seem to not operate at all\n\n34:04.280 --> 34:05.720\n in the visual space.\n\n34:05.720 --> 34:07.840\n They really trust the mathematics,\n\n34:07.840 --> 34:10.600\n like which is really annoying to me because topology\n\n34:10.600 --> 34:15.480\n and differential geometry feels like it has a lot\n\n34:15.480 --> 34:17.480\n of potential for beautiful pictures.\n\n34:17.480 --> 34:18.640\n Yes, I think they do.\n\n34:18.640 --> 34:23.280\n Actually, I would not be able to do my research\n\n34:23.280 --> 34:26.160\n if I don't have an intuitive feel about geometry.\n\n34:26.160 --> 34:29.640\n And we'll get to it as you mentioned before\n\n34:29.640 --> 34:32.080\n that how, for example, in strength theory,\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:33.440\n you deal with these extra dimensions.\n\n34:33.440 --> 34:35.480\n And I'll be very happy to describe how we do it\n\n34:35.480 --> 34:37.640\n because without intuition, we will not get anywhere.\n\n34:37.640 --> 34:40.440\n And I don't think you can just rely on formalism.\n\n34:40.440 --> 34:41.360\n I don't.\n\n34:41.360 --> 34:44.120\n I don't think any physicist just relies on formalism.\n\n34:44.120 --> 34:45.000\n That's not physics.\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:46.680\n That's not understanding.\n\n34:46.680 --> 34:48.080\n So we have to intuit it.\n\n34:48.080 --> 34:49.280\n And that's crucial.\n\n34:49.280 --> 34:50.760\n And there are steps of doing it.\n\n34:50.760 --> 34:52.720\n And we learned it might not be trivial,\n\n34:52.720 --> 34:53.840\n but we learn how to do it.\n\n34:53.840 --> 34:56.520\n Similar to what this Galileo picture I just told you,\n\n34:56.520 --> 34:59.400\n you have to build these gradually.\n\n34:59.400 --> 35:02.000\n But you have to connect the bricks.\n\n35:02.000 --> 35:04.760\n Exactly, you have to connect the bricks, literally.\n\n35:04.760 --> 35:07.720\n So yeah, so then, so going back to your question\n\n35:07.720 --> 35:10.040\n about the path of the history of the science.\n\n35:10.040 --> 35:12.400\n So I was saying about the electricity and magnetism\n\n35:12.400 --> 35:14.560\n and the special relativity where simple idea\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:16.400\n led to special relativity.\n\n35:16.400 --> 35:20.040\n But then he went further thinking about acceleration\n\n35:20.040 --> 35:21.760\n in the context of relativity.\n\n35:21.760 --> 35:23.840\n And he came up with general relativity\n\n35:23.840 --> 35:26.000\n where he talked about the fabric of space time\n\n35:26.000 --> 35:28.800\n being curved and so forth and matter\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:32.080\n affecting the curvature of the space and time.\n\n35:32.080 --> 35:36.960\n So this gradually became a connection\n\n35:36.960 --> 35:38.560\n between geometry and physics.\n\n35:38.560 --> 35:43.160\n Namely, he replaced Newton's gravitational force\n\n35:43.160 --> 35:46.000\n with a very geometrical, beautiful picture.\n\n35:46.000 --> 35:47.520\n It's much more elegant than Newton's,\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:49.960\n but much more complicated mathematically.\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:52.760\n So when we say it's simpler,\n\n35:52.760 --> 35:55.000\n we mean in some form it's simpler,\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:57.800\n but not in pragmatic terms of equation solving.\n\n35:57.800 --> 35:59.800\n The equations are much harder to solve\n\n35:59.800 --> 36:01.360\n in Einstein's theory.\n\n36:01.360 --> 36:03.920\n And in fact, so much harder that Einstein himself\n\n36:03.920 --> 36:06.000\n couldn't solve many of the cases.\n\n36:06.000 --> 36:07.920\n He thought, for example, you couldn't solve the equation\n\n36:07.920 --> 36:10.760\n for a spherical symmetric matter,\n\n36:10.760 --> 36:12.960\n like if you had a symmetric sun,\n\n36:12.960 --> 36:15.680\n he didn't think you can actually solve his equation for that.\n\n36:15.680 --> 36:19.320\n And a year after he said that it was solved by Schwarzschild.\n\n36:19.320 --> 36:21.120\n So it was that hard\n\n36:21.120 --> 36:22.880\n that he didn't think it's gonna be that easy.\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:24.960\n So yeah, deformism is hard.\n\n36:24.960 --> 36:27.400\n But the contrast between the special relativity\n\n36:27.400 --> 36:29.040\n and general relativity is very interesting\n\n36:29.040 --> 36:31.520\n because one of them has almost trivial math\n\n36:31.520 --> 36:34.520\n and the other one has super complicated math.\n\n36:34.520 --> 36:37.600\n Both are physically amazingly important.\n\n36:37.600 --> 36:40.080\n And so we have learned that, you know,\n\n36:40.080 --> 36:44.840\n the physics may or may not require complicated math.\n\n36:44.840 --> 36:47.560\n We should not shy from using complicated math\n\n36:47.560 --> 36:48.760\n like Einstein did.\n\n36:48.760 --> 36:49.920\n Nobody, Einstein wouldn't say,\n\n36:49.920 --> 36:52.040\n I'm not gonna touch this math because it's too much,\n\n36:52.040 --> 36:54.680\n you know, tensors or, you know, curvature\n\n36:54.680 --> 36:56.320\n and I don't like the four dimensional space time\n\n36:56.320 --> 36:57.960\n because I can't see four dimension.\n\n36:57.960 --> 36:59.080\n He wasn't doing that.\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:01.480\n He was willing to abstract from that\n\n37:01.480 --> 37:03.600\n because physics drove him in that direction.\n\n37:03.600 --> 37:05.400\n But his motivation was physics.\n\n37:05.400 --> 37:06.520\n Physics pushed him.\n\n37:06.520 --> 37:09.960\n Just like Newton pushed to develop calculus\n\n37:09.960 --> 37:12.480\n because physics pushed him that he didn't have the tools.\n\n37:12.480 --> 37:14.120\n So he had to develop the tools\n\n37:14.120 --> 37:16.000\n to answer his physics questions.\n\n37:16.000 --> 37:18.720\n So his motivation was physics again.\n\n37:18.720 --> 37:20.760\n So to me, those are examples which show\n\n37:20.760 --> 37:24.560\n that math and physics have this symbiotic relationship\n\n37:24.560 --> 37:26.880\n which kind of reinforce each other.\n\n37:26.880 --> 37:30.080\n Here I'm using, I'm giving you examples of both of them,\n\n37:30.080 --> 37:32.520\n namely Newton's work led to development\n\n37:32.520 --> 37:34.520\n of mathematics, calculus.\n\n37:34.520 --> 37:36.720\n And in the case of Einstein, he didn't develop\n\n37:36.720 --> 37:38.760\n Riemannian geometry, he just used them.\n\n37:38.760 --> 37:42.160\n So it goes both ways and in the context of modern physics,\n\n37:42.160 --> 37:44.520\n we see that again and again, it goes both ways.\n\n37:44.520 --> 37:46.920\n Let me ask a ridiculous question.\n\n37:46.920 --> 37:48.880\n You know, you talk about your favorite soccer player,\n\n37:48.880 --> 37:52.400\n the bar, I'll ask the same question about Einstein's ideas\n\n37:52.400 --> 37:54.640\n which is, which one do you think\n\n37:54.640 --> 37:56.520\n is the biggest leap of genius?\n\n37:56.520 --> 37:59.960\n Is it the E equals MC squared?\n\n37:59.960 --> 38:01.560\n Is it Brownian motion?\n\n38:01.560 --> 38:05.200\n Is it special relativity, is it general relativity?\n\n38:05.200 --> 38:09.760\n Which of the famous set of papers he's written in 1905\n\n38:09.760 --> 38:13.760\n and in general, his work was the biggest leap of genius?\n\n38:13.760 --> 38:16.280\n In my opinion, it's special relativity.\n\n38:16.280 --> 38:19.120\n The idea that speed of light is the same for everybody\n\n38:19.120 --> 38:20.520\n is the beginning of everything he did.\n\n38:20.520 --> 38:21.360\n The beginning is the seed.\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:22.200\n The beginning.\n\n38:22.200 --> 38:24.400\n Once you embrace that weirdness,\n\n38:24.400 --> 38:25.640\n all the weirdness, all the rest.\n\n38:25.640 --> 38:27.800\n I would say that's, even though he says\n\n38:27.800 --> 38:29.720\n the most beautiful moment for him,\n\n38:29.720 --> 38:31.840\n he says that is when he realized that if you fall\n\n38:31.840 --> 38:33.720\n in an elevator, you don't know if you're falling\n\n38:33.720 --> 38:36.440\n or whether you're in the falling elevator\n\n38:36.440 --> 38:39.120\n or whether you're next to the earth, gravitational.\n\n38:39.120 --> 38:41.800\n That to him was his aha moment,\n\n38:41.800 --> 38:43.640\n which inertial mass and gravitational mass\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:46.480\n being identical geometrically and so forth\n\n38:46.480 --> 38:49.520\n as part of the theory, not because of, you know,\n\n38:49.520 --> 38:52.280\n some funny coincidence.\n\n38:52.280 --> 38:54.400\n That's for him, but I feel from outside at least,\n\n38:54.400 --> 38:56.880\n it feels like the speed of light being the same\n\n38:56.880 --> 38:59.200\n is the really aha moment.\n\n38:59.200 --> 39:02.160\n The general relativity to you is not\n\n39:02.160 --> 39:04.960\n like the conception of space time.\n\n39:04.960 --> 39:06.600\n In a sense, the conception of space time\n\n39:06.600 --> 39:08.600\n already was part of the special relativity\n\n39:08.600 --> 39:10.920\n when you talk about length contraction.\n\n39:10.920 --> 39:13.040\n So general relativity takes that to the next step,\n\n39:13.040 --> 39:15.560\n but beginning of it was already space,\n\n39:15.560 --> 39:17.560\n length contracts, time dilates.\n\n39:17.560 --> 39:19.080\n So once you talk about those, then yeah,\n\n39:19.080 --> 39:20.760\n you can dilate more or less different places\n\n39:20.760 --> 39:21.960\n than its curvature.\n\n39:21.960 --> 39:22.920\n So you don't have a choice.\n\n39:22.920 --> 39:26.480\n So it kind of started just with that same simple thought.\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:28.680\n Speed of light is the same for all.\n\n39:28.680 --> 39:32.000\n Where does quantum mechanics come into view?\n\n39:32.000 --> 39:33.520\n Exactly, so this is the next step.\n\n39:33.520 --> 39:36.800\n So Einstein's, you know, developed general relativity\n\n39:36.800 --> 39:38.440\n and he's beginning to develop the foundation\n\n39:38.440 --> 39:39.920\n of quantum mechanics at the same time,\n\n39:39.920 --> 39:42.240\n the photoelectric effects and others.\n\n39:42.240 --> 39:45.680\n And so quantum mechanics overtakes, in fact,\n\n39:45.680 --> 39:47.560\n Einstein in many ways because he doesn't like\n\n39:47.560 --> 39:50.320\n the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics\n\n39:50.320 --> 39:52.320\n and the formulas that's emerging,\n\n39:52.320 --> 39:56.280\n but fits his march on and try to, for example,\n\n39:56.280 --> 39:59.840\n combine Einstein's theory of relativity\n\n39:59.840 --> 40:01.040\n with quantum mechanics.\n\n40:01.040 --> 40:04.040\n So Dirac takes special relativity,\n\n40:04.040 --> 40:07.800\n tries to see how is it compatible with quantum mechanics.\n\n40:07.800 --> 40:10.520\n Can we pause and briefly say what is quantum mechanics?\n\n40:10.520 --> 40:11.360\n Oh yes, sure.\n\n40:11.360 --> 40:14.760\n So quantum mechanics, so I discussed briefly\n\n40:14.760 --> 40:16.440\n when I talked about the connection\n\n40:16.440 --> 40:18.520\n between Newtonian mechanics\n\n40:18.520 --> 40:20.760\n and the Euler Lagrange reformulation\n\n40:20.760 --> 40:23.120\n of the Newtonian mechanics and interpretation\n\n40:23.120 --> 40:27.240\n of this Euler Lagrange formulas in terms of the paths\n\n40:27.240 --> 40:28.560\n that the particle take.\n\n40:28.560 --> 40:31.440\n So when we say a particle goes from here to here,\n\n40:31.440 --> 40:34.480\n we usually think it classically follows\n\n40:34.480 --> 40:38.520\n a specific trajectory, but actually in quantum mechanics,\n\n40:38.520 --> 40:42.960\n it follows every trajectory with different probabilities.\n\n40:42.960 --> 40:44.920\n And so there's this fuzziness.\n\n40:44.920 --> 40:49.280\n Now, most probable, it's the path that you actually see\n\n40:49.280 --> 40:51.840\n and deviation from that is very, very unlikely\n\n40:51.840 --> 40:53.800\n and probabilistically very minuscule.\n\n40:53.800 --> 40:55.040\n So in everyday experiments,\n\n40:55.040 --> 40:58.000\n we don't see anything deviated from what we expect,\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:00.760\n but quantum mechanics tells us that the things\n\n41:00.760 --> 41:01.600\n are more fuzzy.\n\n41:01.600 --> 41:05.760\n Things are not as precise as the line you draw.\n\n41:05.760 --> 41:07.760\n Things are a bit like cloud.\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:11.160\n So if you go to microscopic scales,\n\n41:11.160 --> 41:12.560\n like atomic scales and lower,\n\n41:12.560 --> 41:14.800\n these phenomena become more pronounced.\n\n41:14.800 --> 41:16.280\n You can see it much better.\n\n41:16.280 --> 41:18.360\n The electron is not at the point,\n\n41:18.360 --> 41:21.320\n but the cloud spread out around the nucleus.\n\n41:21.320 --> 41:25.280\n And so this fuzziness, this probabilistic aspect of reality\n\n41:25.280 --> 41:28.280\n is what quantum mechanics describes.\n\n41:28.280 --> 41:31.600\n Can I briefly pause on that idea?\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:33.760\n Do you think quantum mechanics\n\n41:33.760 --> 41:37.040\n is just a really damn good approximation,\n\n41:37.040 --> 41:40.200\n a tool for predicting reality,\n\n41:40.200 --> 41:43.120\n or does it actually describe reality?\n\n41:43.120 --> 41:45.800\n Do you think reality is fuzzy at that level?\n\n41:45.800 --> 41:48.440\n Well, I think that reality is fuzzy at that level,\n\n41:48.440 --> 41:49.840\n but I don't think quantum mechanics\n\n41:49.840 --> 41:51.800\n is necessarily the end of the story.\n\n41:51.800 --> 41:55.760\n So quantum mechanics is certainly an improvement\n\n41:55.760 --> 41:57.400\n over classical physics.\n\n41:57.400 --> 42:00.200\n That much we know by experiments and so forth.\n\n42:00.200 --> 42:02.200\n Whether I'm happy with quantum mechanics,\n\n42:02.200 --> 42:04.000\n whether I view quantum mechanics,\n\n42:04.000 --> 42:05.400\n for example, the thought,\n\n42:05.400 --> 42:08.960\n the measurement description of quantum mechanics,\n\n42:08.960 --> 42:09.960\n am I happy with it?\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:11.760\n Am I thinking that's the end stage or not?\n\n42:11.760 --> 42:12.720\n I don't.\n\n42:12.720 --> 42:14.320\n I don't think we're at the end of that story.\n\n42:14.320 --> 42:17.440\n And many physicists may or may not view this way.\n\n42:17.440 --> 42:18.960\n Some do, some don't.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:22.000\n But I think that it's the best we have right now,\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.080\n that's for sure.\n\n42:23.080 --> 42:25.400\n It's the best approximation for reality we know today.\n\n42:25.400 --> 42:27.320\n And so far, we don't know what it is,\n\n42:27.320 --> 42:30.520\n the next thing that improves it or replaces it and so on.\n\n42:30.520 --> 42:31.560\n But as I mentioned before,\n\n42:31.560 --> 42:34.760\n I don't believe any of the laws of physics we know today\n\n42:34.760 --> 42:36.720\n are permanently exactly correct.\n\n42:36.720 --> 42:38.080\n That doesn't bother me.\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:39.600\n I'm not like dogmatic saying,\n\n42:39.600 --> 42:41.960\n I have figured out this is the law of nature.\n\n42:41.960 --> 42:42.800\n I know everything.\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:45.840\n No, no, that's the beauty about science\n\n42:45.840 --> 42:47.600\n is that we are not dogmatic.\n\n42:47.600 --> 42:49.560\n And we are willing to, in fact,\n\n42:49.560 --> 42:53.960\n we are encouraged to be skeptical of what we ourselves do.\n\n42:53.960 --> 42:55.440\n So you were talking about Dirac.\n\n42:55.440 --> 42:56.640\n Yes, I was talking about Dirac, right.\n\n42:56.640 --> 42:58.920\n So Dirac was trying to now combine\n\n42:58.920 --> 43:01.440\n this Schrodinger's equations,\n\n43:01.440 --> 43:04.600\n which was described in the context of trying to talk about\n\n43:04.600 --> 43:06.680\n how these probabilistic waves of electrons\n\n43:06.680 --> 43:07.840\n move for the atom,\n\n43:07.840 --> 43:09.880\n which was good for speeds\n\n43:09.880 --> 43:11.800\n which were not too close to the speed of light,\n\n43:11.800 --> 43:14.880\n to what happens when you get to the near the speed of light.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:16.480\n So then you need relativity.\n\n43:16.480 --> 43:19.440\n So then Dirac tried to combine Einstein's relativity\n\n43:19.440 --> 43:20.680\n with quantum mechanics.\n\n43:20.680 --> 43:22.480\n So he tried to combine them\n\n43:22.480 --> 43:26.880\n and he wrote this beautiful equation, the Dirac equation,\n\n43:26.880 --> 43:28.560\n which roughly speaking,\n\n43:28.560 --> 43:31.520\n take the square root of the Einstein's equation\n\n43:31.520 --> 43:33.120\n in order to connect it to Schrodinger's\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:34.280\n time evolution operator,\n\n43:34.280 --> 43:37.200\n which is first order in time derivative\n\n43:37.200 --> 43:39.160\n to get rid of the naive thing\n\n43:39.160 --> 43:40.600\n that Einstein's equation would have given,\n\n43:40.600 --> 43:41.440\n which is second order.\n\n43:41.440 --> 43:43.360\n So you have to take a square root.\n\n43:43.360 --> 43:45.600\n Now square root usually has a plus or minus sign\n\n43:45.600 --> 43:46.440\n when you take it.\n\n43:47.520 --> 43:49.120\n And when he did this,\n\n43:49.120 --> 43:50.800\n he originally didn't notice this plus,\n\n43:50.800 --> 43:52.600\n didn't pay attention to this plus or minus sign,\n\n43:52.600 --> 43:55.120\n but later physicists pointed out to Dirac says,\n\n43:55.120 --> 43:57.280\n look, there's also this minus sign.\n\n43:57.280 --> 43:58.440\n And if you use this minus sign,\n\n43:58.440 --> 43:59.760\n you get negative energy.\n\n44:01.120 --> 44:04.640\n In fact, it was very, very annoying that, you know,\n\n44:04.640 --> 44:06.680\n somebody else tells you this obvious mistake you make.\n\n44:06.680 --> 44:09.840\n Pauli famous physicist told Dirac, this is nonsense.\n\n44:09.840 --> 44:11.640\n You're going to get negative energy with your equation,\n\n44:11.640 --> 44:13.480\n which negative energy without any bottom,\n\n44:13.480 --> 44:15.520\n you can go all the way down to negative.\n\n44:15.520 --> 44:18.080\n Infinite energy, so it doesn't make any sense.\n\n44:18.080 --> 44:19.120\n Dirac thought about it.\n\n44:19.120 --> 44:22.200\n And then he remembered Pauli's exclusion principle\n\n44:22.200 --> 44:23.040\n just before him.\n\n44:23.040 --> 44:24.240\n Pauli had said, you know,\n\n44:24.240 --> 44:26.640\n there's this principle called the exclusion principle\n\n44:26.640 --> 44:30.240\n that, you know, two electrons cannot be on the same orbit.\n\n44:30.240 --> 44:32.680\n And so Dirac said, okay, you know what?\n\n44:32.680 --> 44:37.680\n All these negative energy states are filled orbits,\n\n44:37.680 --> 44:38.920\n occupied.\n\n44:38.920 --> 44:40.120\n So according to you,\n\n44:42.200 --> 44:44.880\n Mr. Pauli, there's no place to go.\n\n44:44.880 --> 44:47.200\n So therefore they only have to go positive.\n\n44:47.200 --> 44:49.160\n Sounded like a big cheat.\n\n44:49.160 --> 44:51.960\n And then Pauli said, oh, you know what?\n\n44:51.960 --> 44:53.880\n We can change orbits from one orbit to another.\n\n44:53.880 --> 44:55.800\n What if I take one of these negative energy orbits\n\n44:55.800 --> 44:57.560\n and put it up there?\n\n44:57.560 --> 44:59.720\n Then it seems to be a new particle,\n\n44:59.720 --> 45:03.200\n which has opposite properties to the electron.\n\n45:03.200 --> 45:06.000\n It has positive energy, but it has positive charge.\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:06.920\n What is that?\n\n45:09.160 --> 45:10.400\n Dirac was a bit worried.\n\n45:10.400 --> 45:11.560\n He said, maybe that's proton\n\n45:11.560 --> 45:13.480\n because proton has plus charge.\n\n45:13.480 --> 45:14.720\n He wasn't sure.\n\n45:14.720 --> 45:16.480\n But then he said, oh, maybe it's proton.\n\n45:16.480 --> 45:17.760\n But then they said, no, no, no, no.\n\n45:17.760 --> 45:19.360\n It has the same mass as the electron.\n\n45:19.360 --> 45:22.240\n It cannot be proton because proton is heavier.\n\n45:22.240 --> 45:23.080\n Dirac was stuck.\n\n45:23.080 --> 45:25.840\n He says, well, then maybe another part we haven't seen.\n\n45:27.600 --> 45:31.080\n By that time, Dirac himself was getting a little bit worried\n\n45:31.080 --> 45:34.480\n about his own equation and his own crazy interpretation.\n\n45:34.480 --> 45:37.080\n Until a few years later, Anderson,\n\n45:37.080 --> 45:40.640\n in the photographic place that he had gotten\n\n45:40.640 --> 45:42.000\n from these cosmic rays,\n\n45:42.000 --> 45:45.920\n he discovered a particle which goes\n\n45:45.920 --> 45:47.920\n in the opposite direction that the electron goes\n\n45:47.920 --> 45:49.880\n when there's a magnetic field,\n\n45:49.880 --> 45:52.320\n and with the same mass,\n\n45:52.320 --> 45:55.160\n exactly like what Dirac had predicted.\n\n45:55.160 --> 45:57.640\n And this was what we call now positron.\n\n45:57.640 --> 46:00.280\n And in fact, beginning with the work of Dirac,\n\n46:00.280 --> 46:03.200\n we know that every particle has an antiparticle.\n\n46:03.200 --> 46:05.480\n And so this idea that there's an antiparticle\n\n46:05.480 --> 46:06.840\n came from this simple math.\n\n46:06.840 --> 46:08.800\n There's a plus and a minus\n\n46:08.800 --> 46:12.800\n from the Dirac's quote unquote mistake.\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:15.400\n So again, trying to combine ideas,\n\n46:15.400 --> 46:18.080\n sometimes the math is smarter than the person\n\n46:18.080 --> 46:20.080\n who uses it to apply it,\n\n46:20.080 --> 46:21.200\n and you try to resist it,\n\n46:21.200 --> 46:23.720\n and then you kind of confront it by criticism,\n\n46:23.720 --> 46:25.080\n which is the way it should be.\n\n46:25.080 --> 46:26.920\n So physicists comes and said, no, no, that's wrong,\n\n46:26.920 --> 46:27.840\n and you correct it, and so on.\n\n46:27.840 --> 46:30.800\n So that is a development of the idea\n\n46:30.800 --> 46:32.800\n there's particle, there's antiparticle, and so on.\n\n46:32.800 --> 46:34.800\n So this is the beginning of development\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:37.440\n of quantum mechanics and the connection with relativity,\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:38.880\n but the thing was more challenging\n\n46:38.880 --> 46:40.760\n because we had to also describe\n\n46:40.760 --> 46:44.760\n how electric and magnetic fields work with quantum mechanics.\n\n46:44.760 --> 46:46.200\n This was much more complicated\n\n46:46.200 --> 46:47.760\n because it's not just one point.\n\n46:47.760 --> 46:50.360\n Electric and magnetic fields were everywhere.\n\n46:50.360 --> 46:52.440\n So you had to talk about fluctuating\n\n46:52.440 --> 46:54.200\n and a fuzziness of electrical fields\n\n46:54.200 --> 46:56.320\n and magnetic fields everywhere.\n\n46:56.320 --> 47:00.680\n And the math for that was very difficult to deal with.\n\n47:00.680 --> 47:03.560\n And this led to a subject called quantum field theory.\n\n47:03.560 --> 47:06.680\n Fields like electric and magnetic fields had to be quantum,\n\n47:06.680 --> 47:09.080\n had to be described also in a wavy way.\n\n47:09.080 --> 47:13.280\n Feynman in particular was one of the pioneers\n\n47:13.280 --> 47:15.120\n along with Schrodingers and others\n\n47:15.120 --> 47:17.000\n to try to come up with a formalism\n\n47:17.000 --> 47:20.800\n to deal with fields like electric and magnetic fields,\n\n47:20.800 --> 47:24.200\n interacting with electrons in a consistent quantum fashion.\n\n47:24.200 --> 47:25.960\n And they developed this beautiful theory,\n\n47:25.960 --> 47:27.600\n quantum electrodynamics from that.\n\n47:27.600 --> 47:30.040\n And later on that same formalism,\n\n47:30.040 --> 47:33.640\n quantum field theory led to the discovery of other forces\n\n47:33.640 --> 47:35.520\n and other particles all consistent\n\n47:35.520 --> 47:37.840\n with the idea of quantum mechanics.\n\n47:37.840 --> 47:40.760\n So that was how physics progressed.\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:43.600\n And so basically we learned that all particles\n\n47:43.600 --> 47:47.440\n and all the forces are in some sense related\n\n47:47.440 --> 47:49.640\n to particle exchanges.\n\n47:49.640 --> 47:52.320\n And so for example, electromagnetic forces\n\n47:52.320 --> 47:57.320\n are mediated by a particle we call photon and so forth.\n\n47:57.440 --> 47:59.680\n And same for other forces that they discovered,\n\n47:59.680 --> 48:01.040\n strong forces and the weak forces.\n\n48:01.040 --> 48:03.880\n So we got the sense of what quantum field theory is.\n\n48:03.880 --> 48:08.880\n Is that a big leap of an idea that particles\n\n48:09.280 --> 48:12.200\n are fluctuations in the field?\n\n48:12.200 --> 48:15.040\n Like the idea that everything is a field.\n\n48:15.040 --> 48:18.240\n It's the old Einstein, light is a wave,\n\n48:18.240 --> 48:20.240\n both a particle and a wave kind of idea.\n\n48:20.240 --> 48:23.920\n Is that a huge leap in our understanding\n\n48:23.920 --> 48:26.360\n of conceiving the universe as fields?\n\n48:26.360 --> 48:27.200\n I would say so.\n\n48:27.200 --> 48:29.720\n I would say that viewing the particles,\n\n48:29.720 --> 48:31.800\n this duality that Bohr mentioned\n\n48:31.800 --> 48:33.040\n between particles and waves,\n\n48:33.040 --> 48:35.080\n that waves can behave sometimes like particles,\n\n48:35.080 --> 48:36.320\n sometimes like waves,\n\n48:36.320 --> 48:40.240\n is one of the biggest leaps of imagination\n\n48:40.240 --> 48:42.800\n that quantum mechanics made physics do.\n\n48:42.800 --> 48:45.480\n So I agree that that is quite remarkable.\n\n48:45.480 --> 48:50.240\n Is duality fundamental to the universe\n\n48:50.240 --> 48:52.200\n or is it just because we don't understand it fully?\n\n48:52.200 --> 48:54.320\n Like will it eventually collapse\n\n48:54.320 --> 48:57.800\n into a clean explanation that doesn't require duality?\n\n48:57.800 --> 49:02.440\n Like that a phenomena could be two things at once\n\n49:02.440 --> 49:04.400\n and both to be true.\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:05.960\n So that seems weird.\n\n49:05.960 --> 49:08.320\n So in fact I was going to get to that\n\n49:08.320 --> 49:09.360\n when we get to string theory\n\n49:09.360 --> 49:11.000\n but maybe I can comment on that now.\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:13.520\n Duality turns out to be running the show today\n\n49:13.520 --> 49:15.600\n and the whole thing that we are doing is string theory.\n\n49:15.600 --> 49:17.840\n Duality is the name of the game.\n\n49:17.840 --> 49:19.440\n So it's the most beautiful subject\n\n49:19.440 --> 49:20.840\n and I want to talk about it.\n\n49:20.840 --> 49:23.440\n Let's talk about it in the context of string theory then.\n\n49:23.440 --> 49:27.200\n So we do want to take a next step into,\n\n49:27.200 --> 49:28.680\n because we mentioned general relativity,\n\n49:28.680 --> 49:30.480\n we mentioned quantum mechanics,\n\n49:30.480 --> 49:32.640\n is there something to be said about quantum gravity?\n\n49:32.640 --> 49:34.960\n Yes, that's exactly the right point to talk about.\n\n49:34.960 --> 49:37.480\n So namely we have talked about quantum fields\n\n49:37.480 --> 49:39.760\n and I talked about electric forces,\n\n49:39.760 --> 49:42.720\n photon being the particle carrying those forces.\n\n49:42.720 --> 49:46.600\n So for gravity, quantizing gravitational field\n\n49:46.600 --> 49:49.600\n which is this curvature of space time according to Einstein,\n\n49:49.600 --> 49:51.640\n you get another particle called graviton.\n\n49:52.520 --> 49:55.000\n So what about gravitons?\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:56.440\n Should be there, no problem.\n\n49:56.440 --> 49:59.160\n So then you start computing it.\n\n49:59.160 --> 50:00.440\n What do I mean by computing it?\n\n50:00.440 --> 50:03.400\n Well, you compute scattering of one graviton\n\n50:03.400 --> 50:06.080\n off another graviton, maybe with graviton with an electron\n\n50:06.080 --> 50:07.920\n and so on, see what you get.\n\n50:07.920 --> 50:12.480\n Feynman had already mastered this quantum electrodynamics.\n\n50:12.480 --> 50:14.400\n He said, no problem, let me do it.\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:17.200\n Even though these are such weak forces,\n\n50:17.200 --> 50:18.360\n the gravity is very weak.\n\n50:18.360 --> 50:19.680\n So therefore to see them,\n\n50:19.680 --> 50:23.240\n these quantum effects of gravitational waves was impossible.\n\n50:23.240 --> 50:25.480\n It's even impossible today.\n\n50:25.480 --> 50:27.680\n So Feynman just did it for fun.\n\n50:27.680 --> 50:30.080\n He usually had this mindset that I want to do something\n\n50:30.080 --> 50:31.160\n which I will see in experiment,\n\n50:31.160 --> 50:33.240\n but this one, let's just see what it does.\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:36.680\n And he was surprised because the same techniques\n\n50:36.680 --> 50:39.960\n he was using for doing the same calculations,\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:43.120\n quantum electrodynamics, when applied to gravity failed.\n\n50:44.720 --> 50:46.280\n The formulas seem to make sense,\n\n50:46.280 --> 50:47.560\n but he had to do some integrals\n\n50:47.560 --> 50:49.040\n and he found that when he does those integrals,\n\n50:49.040 --> 50:52.200\n he got infinity and it didn't make any sense.\n\n50:52.200 --> 50:54.520\n Now there were similar infinities in the other pieces\n\n50:54.520 --> 50:56.920\n but he had managed to make sense out of those before.\n\n50:56.920 --> 50:59.920\n This was no way he could make sense out of it.\n\n50:59.920 --> 51:01.920\n He just didn't know what to do.\n\n51:01.920 --> 51:03.560\n He didn't feel it's an urgent issue\n\n51:03.560 --> 51:05.800\n because nobody could do the experiment.\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:07.840\n So he was kind of said, okay, there's this thing,\n\n51:07.840 --> 51:09.440\n but okay, we don't know how to exactly do it,\n\n51:09.440 --> 51:11.680\n but that's the way it is.\n\n51:11.680 --> 51:14.080\n So in some sense, a natural conclusion\n\n51:14.080 --> 51:16.640\n from what Feynman did could have been like,\n\n51:16.640 --> 51:19.440\n gravity cannot be consistent with quantum theory,\n\n51:19.440 --> 51:20.600\n but that cannot be the case\n\n51:20.600 --> 51:22.000\n because gravity is in our universe,\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:23.040\n quantum mechanics in our universe,\n\n51:23.040 --> 51:25.560\n they both together somehow should work.\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:28.960\n So it's not acceptable to say they don't work together.\n\n51:28.960 --> 51:30.800\n So that was a puzzle.\n\n51:30.800 --> 51:32.400\n How does it possibly work?\n\n51:32.400 --> 51:34.660\n It was left open.\n\n51:34.660 --> 51:37.120\n And then we get to the string theory.\n\n51:37.120 --> 51:38.880\n So this is the puzzle of quantum gravity.\n\n51:38.880 --> 51:41.420\n The particle description of quantum gravity failed.\n\n51:41.420 --> 51:43.160\n So the infinity shows up.\n\n51:43.160 --> 51:45.840\n What do we do with infinity?\n\n51:45.840 --> 51:47.120\n Let's get to the fun part.\n\n51:47.120 --> 51:48.760\n Let's talk about string theory.\n\n51:48.760 --> 51:49.600\n Yes.\n\n51:50.840 --> 51:55.840\n Let's discuss some technical basics of string theory.\n\n51:56.300 --> 51:57.740\n What is string theory?\n\n51:57.740 --> 51:59.140\n What is a string?\n\n51:59.140 --> 52:01.080\n How many dimensions are we talking about?\n\n52:01.080 --> 52:02.720\n What are the different states?\n\n52:02.720 --> 52:04.960\n How do we represent the elementary particles\n\n52:04.960 --> 52:09.780\n and the laws of physics using this new framework?\n\n52:09.780 --> 52:12.840\n So string theory is the idea\n\n52:12.840 --> 52:16.280\n that the fundamental entities are not particles,\n\n52:16.280 --> 52:18.920\n but extended higher dimensional objects\n\n52:18.920 --> 52:22.360\n like one dimensional strings, like loops.\n\n52:22.360 --> 52:25.000\n These loops could be open like with two ends,\n\n52:25.000 --> 52:29.720\n like an interval or a circle without any ends.\n\n52:29.720 --> 52:32.700\n And they're vibrating and moving around in space.\n\n52:32.700 --> 52:34.880\n So how big they are?\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:37.600\n Well, you can of course stretch it and make it big,\n\n52:37.600 --> 52:39.600\n or you can just let it be whatever it wants.\n\n52:39.600 --> 52:41.320\n It can be as small as a point\n\n52:41.320 --> 52:44.280\n because the circle can shrink to a point\n\n52:44.280 --> 52:45.520\n and be very light,\n\n52:45.520 --> 52:48.080\n or you can stretch it and becomes very massive,\n\n52:48.080 --> 52:50.240\n or it could oscillate and become massive that way.\n\n52:50.240 --> 52:52.320\n So it depends on which kind of state you have.\n\n52:52.320 --> 52:55.000\n In fact, the string can have infinitely many modes,\n\n52:55.000 --> 52:56.920\n depending on which kind of oscillation it's doing.\n\n52:56.920 --> 52:59.040\n Like a guitar has different harmonics,\n\n52:59.040 --> 53:00.140\n string has different harmonics,\n\n53:00.140 --> 53:03.000\n but for the string, each harmonic is a particle.\n\n53:03.000 --> 53:04.440\n So each particle will give you,\n\n53:04.440 --> 53:07.480\n ah, this is a more massive harmonic, this is a less massive.\n\n53:07.480 --> 53:10.000\n So the lightest harmonic, so to speak, is no harmonics,\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:12.820\n which means like the string shrunk to a point,\n\n53:12.820 --> 53:15.280\n and then it becomes like a massless particles\n\n53:15.280 --> 53:19.600\n or light particles like photon and graviton and so forth.\n\n53:19.600 --> 53:22.640\n So when you look at tiny strings,\n\n53:22.640 --> 53:25.500\n which are shrunk to a point, the lightest ones,\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:27.640\n they look like the particles that we think,\n\n53:27.640 --> 53:28.560\n they're like particles.\n\n53:28.560 --> 53:31.100\n In other words, from far away, they look like a point.\n\n53:31.100 --> 53:32.140\n But of course, if you zoom in,\n\n53:32.140 --> 53:35.080\n there's this tiny little circle that's there\n\n53:35.080 --> 53:37.080\n that's shrunk to almost a point.\n\n53:37.080 --> 53:40.560\n Should we be imagining, this is to the visual intuition,\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:42.720\n should we be imagining literally strings\n\n53:42.720 --> 53:47.120\n that are potentially connected as a loop or not?\n\n53:47.120 --> 53:50.640\n We knew, and when somebody outside of physics\n\n53:50.640 --> 53:53.920\n is imagining a basic element of string theory,\n\n53:53.920 --> 53:55.080\n which is a string,\n\n53:56.520 --> 53:58.720\n should we literally be thinking about a string?\n\n53:58.720 --> 54:00.560\n Yes, you should literally think about string,\n\n54:00.560 --> 54:02.600\n but string with zero thickness.\n\n54:02.600 --> 54:03.920\n With zero thickness.\n\n54:03.920 --> 54:07.720\n So notice, it's a loop of energy, so to speak,\n\n54:07.720 --> 54:08.780\n if you can think of it that way.\n\n54:08.780 --> 54:11.080\n And so there's a tension like a regular string,\n\n54:11.080 --> 54:14.120\n if you pull it, there's, you know, you have to stretch it.\n\n54:14.120 --> 54:16.280\n But it's not like a thickness, like you're made of something,\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:17.800\n it's just energy.\n\n54:17.800 --> 54:19.680\n It's not made of atoms or something like that.\n\n54:19.680 --> 54:21.800\n But it is very, very tiny.\n\n54:21.800 --> 54:22.640\n Very tiny.\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:25.680\n Much smaller than elementary particles of physics.\n\n54:25.680 --> 54:26.600\n Much smaller.\n\n54:26.600 --> 54:29.760\n So we think if you let the string to be by itself,\n\n54:29.760 --> 54:32.240\n the lowest state, there'll be like fuzziness\n\n54:32.240 --> 54:33.840\n or a size of that tiny little circle,\n\n54:33.840 --> 54:35.320\n which is like a point,\n\n54:35.320 --> 54:37.340\n about, could be anything between,\n\n54:37.340 --> 54:38.380\n we don't know the exact size,\n\n54:38.380 --> 54:40.320\n but in different models have different sizes,\n\n54:40.320 --> 54:42.160\n but something of the order of 10 to the minus,\n\n54:42.160 --> 54:43.620\n let's say 30 centimeters.\n\n54:43.620 --> 54:46.680\n So 10 to the minus 30 centimeters,\n\n54:46.680 --> 54:48.360\n just to compare it with the size of the atom,\n\n54:48.360 --> 54:50.400\n which is 10 to the minus eight centimeters,\n\n54:50.400 --> 54:53.320\n is 22 orders of magnitude smaller.\n\n54:53.320 --> 54:54.160\n So.\n\n54:54.160 --> 54:56.140\n Unimaginably small, I would say.\n\n54:56.140 --> 54:56.980\n Very small.\n\n54:56.980 --> 54:58.800\n So we basically think from far away,\n\n54:58.800 --> 55:00.920\n string is like a point particle.\n\n55:00.920 --> 55:03.720\n And that's why a lot of the things that we learned\n\n55:03.720 --> 55:04.920\n about point particle physics\n\n55:04.920 --> 55:07.020\n carries over directly to strings.\n\n55:07.020 --> 55:09.000\n So therefore there's not much of a mystery\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.940\n why particle physics was successful,\n\n55:10.940 --> 55:12.440\n because a string is like a particle\n\n55:12.440 --> 55:13.640\n when it's not stretched.\n\n55:14.560 --> 55:17.000\n But it turns out having this size,\n\n55:17.000 --> 55:20.240\n being able to oscillate, get bigger,\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:22.460\n turned out to be resolving this puzzles\n\n55:22.460 --> 55:26.700\n that Feynman was having in calculating his diagrams,\n\n55:26.700 --> 55:28.640\n and it gets rid of those infinities.\n\n55:28.640 --> 55:31.360\n So when you're trying to do those infinities,\n\n55:31.360 --> 55:34.400\n the regions that give infinities to Feynman,\n\n55:34.400 --> 55:35.780\n as soon as you get to those regions,\n\n55:35.780 --> 55:38.080\n then this string starts to oscillate,\n\n55:38.080 --> 55:40.560\n and these oscillation structure of the strings\n\n55:40.560 --> 55:43.040\n resolves those infinities to finite answer at the end.\n\n55:43.040 --> 55:45.040\n So the size of the string,\n\n55:45.040 --> 55:46.820\n the fact that it's one dimensional,\n\n55:46.820 --> 55:48.720\n gives a finite answer at the end.\n\n55:48.720 --> 55:50.760\n Resolves this paradox.\n\n55:50.760 --> 55:54.160\n Now, perhaps it's also useful to recount\n\n55:54.160 --> 55:56.320\n of how string theory came to be.\n\n55:56.320 --> 55:58.360\n Because it wasn't like somebody say,\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:01.920\n well, let me solve the problem of Einstein's,\n\n56:01.920 --> 56:04.480\n solve the problem that Feynman had with unifying\n\n56:04.480 --> 56:06.560\n Einstein's theory with quantum mechanics\n\n56:06.560 --> 56:08.120\n by replacing the point by a string.\n\n56:08.120 --> 56:10.200\n No, that's not the way the thought process,\n\n56:10.200 --> 56:12.820\n the thought process was much more random.\n\n56:14.220 --> 56:16.020\n Physicist, then it's John on this case,\n\n56:16.020 --> 56:17.960\n was trying to describe the interactions\n\n56:17.960 --> 56:22.160\n they were seeing in colliders, in accelerators.\n\n56:22.160 --> 56:23.600\n And they were seeing that some process,\n\n56:23.600 --> 56:26.520\n in some process, when two particles came together\n\n56:26.520 --> 56:29.800\n and joined together and when they were separately,\n\n56:29.800 --> 56:34.060\n in one way, and the opposite way, they behave the same way.\n\n56:34.060 --> 56:37.680\n In some way, there was a symmetry, a duality,\n\n56:37.680 --> 56:38.960\n which he didn't understand.\n\n56:38.960 --> 56:41.960\n The particles didn't seem to have that symmetry.\n\n56:41.960 --> 56:43.060\n He said, I don't know what it is,\n\n56:43.060 --> 56:44.760\n what's the reason that these colliders\n\n56:44.760 --> 56:46.780\n and experiments we're doing seems to have the symmetry,\n\n56:46.780 --> 56:48.960\n but let me write the mathematical formula,\n\n56:49.840 --> 56:51.680\n which exhibits that symmetry.\n\n56:51.680 --> 56:54.080\n He used gamma functions, beta functions and all that,\n\n56:54.080 --> 56:56.580\n you know, complete math, no physics,\n\n56:56.580 --> 56:59.320\n other than trying to get symmetry out of his equation.\n\n56:59.320 --> 57:03.360\n He just wrote down a formula as the answer for a process,\n\n57:03.360 --> 57:04.840\n not a method to compute it.\n\n57:04.840 --> 57:08.120\n Just say, wouldn't it be nice if this was the answer?\n\n57:08.120 --> 57:08.960\n Yes.\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:11.200\n Physics looked at this one, that's intriguing,\n\n57:11.200 --> 57:13.480\n it has the symmetry all right, but what is this?\n\n57:13.480 --> 57:14.800\n Where is this coming from?\n\n57:14.800 --> 57:17.400\n Which kind of physics gives you this?\n\n57:17.400 --> 57:18.240\n So I don't know.\n\n57:19.660 --> 57:21.760\n A few years later, people saw that,\n\n57:21.760 --> 57:23.520\n oh, the equation that you're writing,\n\n57:23.520 --> 57:26.400\n the process you're writing in the intermediate channels\n\n57:26.400 --> 57:27.800\n that particles come together,\n\n57:27.800 --> 57:30.100\n seems to have all the harmonics.\n\n57:30.100 --> 57:32.320\n Harmonics sounds like a string.\n\n57:32.320 --> 57:33.680\n Let me see if what you're describing\n\n57:33.680 --> 57:34.680\n has anything to do with the strings.\n\n57:34.680 --> 57:36.400\n And people try to see if what he's doing\n\n57:36.400 --> 57:37.400\n has anything to do with the strings.\n\n57:37.400 --> 57:38.960\n Oh, yeah, indeed.\n\n57:38.960 --> 57:40.880\n If I study scattering of two strings,\n\n57:40.880 --> 57:42.840\n I get exactly the formula you wrote down.\n\n57:42.840 --> 57:45.280\n That was the reinterpretation\n\n57:45.280 --> 57:48.500\n of what he had written in the formula as the strings,\n\n57:48.500 --> 57:51.120\n but still had nothing to do with gravity.\n\n57:51.120 --> 57:53.400\n It had nothing to do with resolving the problems\n\n57:53.400 --> 57:55.200\n of gravity with quantum mechanics.\n\n57:55.200 --> 57:57.600\n It was just trying to explain a process\n\n57:57.600 --> 58:01.160\n that people were seeing in hydronic physics collisions.\n\n58:01.160 --> 58:04.420\n So it took a few more years to get to that point.\n\n58:04.420 --> 58:07.460\n They did notice that,\n\n58:07.460 --> 58:10.340\n physicists noticed that whenever you try to find\n\n58:10.340 --> 58:13.420\n the spectrum of strings, you always get a massless particle\n\n58:13.420 --> 58:14.860\n which has exactly the properties\n\n58:14.860 --> 58:16.940\n that the graviton is supposed to have.\n\n58:16.940 --> 58:20.180\n And no particle in hydronic physics that had that property.\n\n58:20.180 --> 58:22.740\n You are getting a massless graviton\n\n58:22.740 --> 58:25.720\n as part of this scattering without looking for it.\n\n58:25.720 --> 58:27.520\n It was forced on you.\n\n58:27.520 --> 58:29.760\n People were not trying to solve quantum gravity.\n\n58:29.760 --> 58:31.860\n Quantum gravity was pushed on them.\n\n58:31.860 --> 58:33.360\n I don't want this graviton.\n\n58:33.360 --> 58:34.200\n Get rid of it.\n\n58:34.200 --> 58:36.100\n They couldn't get rid of it.\n\n58:36.100 --> 58:38.380\n They gave up trying to get rid of it.\n\n58:38.380 --> 58:39.860\n Physicists, Sherk and Schwartz said,\n\n58:39.860 --> 58:43.340\n you know what, string theory is theory of quantum gravity.\n\n58:43.340 --> 58:45.700\n They've changed their perspective altogether.\n\n58:45.700 --> 58:47.620\n We are not describing the hydronic physics.\n\n58:47.620 --> 58:49.820\n We are describing this theory of quantum gravity.\n\n58:49.820 --> 58:54.140\n And that's when string theory probably got like exciting\n\n58:54.140 --> 58:56.380\n that this could be the unifying theory.\n\n58:56.380 --> 58:57.820\n Exactly, it got exciting,\n\n58:57.820 --> 58:59.520\n but at the same time, not so fast.\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:02.860\n Namely, it should have been fast, but it wasn't\n\n59:02.860 --> 59:05.100\n because particle physics through quantum field theory\n\n59:05.100 --> 59:07.100\n were so successful at that time.\n\n59:07.100 --> 59:10.060\n This is mid seventies, standard model of physics,\n\n59:10.060 --> 59:12.860\n electromagnetism and unification of electromagnetic forces\n\n59:12.860 --> 59:15.100\n with all the other forces were beginning to take place\n\n59:15.100 --> 59:16.380\n without the gravity part.\n\n59:17.380 --> 59:20.900\n Everything was working beautifully for particle physics.\n\n59:20.900 --> 59:23.160\n And so that was the shining golden age\n\n59:23.160 --> 59:25.260\n of quantum field theory and all the experiments,\n\n59:25.260 --> 59:27.980\n standard model, this and that, unification,\n\n59:27.980 --> 59:29.820\n spontaneous symmetry breaking was taking place.\n\n59:29.820 --> 59:31.020\n All of them was nice.\n\n59:31.020 --> 59:32.340\n This was kind of like a side show\n\n59:32.340 --> 59:34.380\n and nobody was paying so much attention.\n\n59:34.380 --> 59:37.300\n This exotic string is needed for quantum gravity.\n\n59:37.300 --> 59:39.520\n Maybe there's other ways, maybe we should do something else.\n\n59:39.520 --> 59:41.940\n So, yeah, it wasn't paid much attention to.\n\n59:41.940 --> 59:44.060\n And this took a little bit more effort\n\n59:44.060 --> 59:48.060\n to try to actually connect it to reality.\n\n59:48.060 --> 59:49.100\n There are a few more steps.\n\n59:49.100 --> 59:51.280\n First of all, there was a puzzle\n\n59:51.280 --> 59:53.940\n that you were getting extra dimensions.\n\n59:53.940 --> 59:55.600\n String was not working well\n\n59:55.600 --> 59:57.820\n with three spatial dimension on one time.\n\n59:57.820 --> 59:59.140\n It needed extra dimension.\n\n59:59.140 --> 1:00:02.500\n Now, there are different versions of strings,\n\n1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.780\n but the version that ended up being related\n\n1:00:04.780 --> 1:00:06.820\n to having particles like electron,\n\n1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:09.340\n what we call fermions, needed 10 dimensions,\n\n1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:11.220\n what we call super string.\n\n1:00:12.220 --> 1:00:13.060\n Now, why super?\n\n1:00:13.060 --> 1:00:13.900\n Why the word super?\n\n1:00:13.900 --> 1:00:17.340\n It turns out this version of the string,\n\n1:00:17.340 --> 1:00:20.100\n which had fermions, had an extra symmetry,\n\n1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:22.840\n which we call supersymmetry.\n\n1:00:23.740 --> 1:00:27.940\n This is a symmetry between a particle and another particle\n\n1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:29.620\n with exactly the same properties,\n\n1:00:29.620 --> 1:00:31.660\n same mass, same charge, et cetera.\n\n1:00:31.660 --> 1:00:33.060\n The only difference is that one of them\n\n1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:35.820\n has a little different spin than the other one.\n\n1:00:35.820 --> 1:00:38.780\n And one of them is a boson, one of them is a fermion\n\n1:00:38.780 --> 1:00:41.060\n because of that shift of spin.\n\n1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:42.100\n Otherwise, they're identical.\n\n1:00:42.100 --> 1:00:43.560\n So there was this symmetry.\n\n1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:45.520\n String theory had this symmetry.\n\n1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:48.340\n In fact, supersymmetry was discovered\n\n1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.440\n through string theory, theoretically.\n\n1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.860\n So theoretically, the first place that this was observed\n\n1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:57.700\n when you were describing these fermionic strings.\n\n1:00:57.700 --> 1:01:00.220\n So that was the beginning of the study of supersymmetry\n\n1:01:00.220 --> 1:01:02.180\n was via string theory.\n\n1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:05.020\n And then it had remarkable properties\n\n1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:07.220\n that the symmetry meant and so forth\n\n1:01:07.220 --> 1:01:10.680\n that people began studying supersymmetry after that.\n\n1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:13.580\n And that was a kind of a tangent direction\n\n1:01:13.580 --> 1:01:15.720\n at the beginning for string theory.\n\n1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:17.940\n But people in particle physics started also thinking,\n\n1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:19.040\n oh, supersymmetry is great.\n\n1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:21.060\n Let's see if we can have supersymmetry\n\n1:01:21.060 --> 1:01:22.380\n in particle physics and so forth.\n\n1:01:22.380 --> 1:01:23.260\n Forget about strings.\n\n1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:25.700\n And they developed on a different track as well.\n\n1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:27.660\n Supersymmetry in different models\n\n1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:29.100\n became a subject on its own right,\n\n1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:32.260\n understanding supersymmetry and what does this mean?\n\n1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:34.100\n Because it unified bosons and fermion,\n\n1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:36.040\n unified some ideas together.\n\n1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:39.140\n So photon is a boson, electron is a fermion.\n\n1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:41.540\n Could things like that be somehow related?\n\n1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:43.660\n It was a kind of a natural kind of a question\n\n1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:44.940\n to try to kind of unify\n\n1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:48.100\n because in physics, we love unification.\n\n1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:50.220\n Now, gradually, string theory was beginning\n\n1:01:50.220 --> 1:01:51.700\n to show signs of unification.\n\n1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:54.820\n It had graviton, but people found that you also have\n\n1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:56.500\n things like photons in them,\n\n1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.100\n different excitations of string behave like photons,\n\n1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:01.100\n another one behaves like electron.\n\n1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:04.740\n So a single string was unifying all these particles\n\n1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:06.340\n into one object.\n\n1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:07.380\n That's remarkable.\n\n1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:10.580\n It's in 10 dimensions though.\n\n1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:11.740\n It is not our universe\n\n1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:13.500\n because we live in three plus one dimension.\n\n1:02:13.500 --> 1:02:15.580\n How could that be possibly true?\n\n1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:18.220\n So this was a conundrum.\n\n1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:19.940\n It was elegant, it was beautiful,\n\n1:02:19.940 --> 1:02:21.940\n but it was very specific\n\n1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:23.600\n about which dimension you're getting,\n\n1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.060\n which structure you're getting.\n\n1:02:25.060 --> 1:02:27.660\n It wasn't saying, oh, you just put D equals to four,\n\n1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:29.540\n you'll get your space time dimension that you want.\n\n1:02:29.540 --> 1:02:30.900\n No, it didn't like that.\n\n1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:34.300\n It said, I want 10 dimensions and that's the way it is.\n\n1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:35.700\n So it was very specific.\n\n1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:37.660\n Now, so people try to reconcile this\n\n1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:39.340\n by the idea that, you know,\n\n1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:41.980\n maybe these extra dimensions are tiny.\n\n1:02:41.980 --> 1:02:45.260\n So if you take three macroscopic spatial dimensions\n\n1:02:45.260 --> 1:02:49.460\n on one time and six extra tiny spatial dimensions,\n\n1:02:49.460 --> 1:02:51.760\n like tiny spheres or tiny circles,\n\n1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:55.980\n then it avoids contradiction with manifest fact\n\n1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:59.740\n that we haven't seen extra dimensions in experiments today.\n\n1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:03.060\n So that was a way to avoid conflict.\n\n1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:05.900\n Now, this was a way to avoid conflict,\n\n1:03:05.900 --> 1:03:09.300\n but it was not observed in experiments.\n\n1:03:09.300 --> 1:03:10.580\n A string observed in experiments?\n\n1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:12.040\n No, because it's so small.\n\n1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:16.020\n So it's beginning to sound a little bit funny.\n\n1:03:16.020 --> 1:03:19.620\n Similar feeling to the way perhaps Dirac had felt\n\n1:03:19.620 --> 1:03:21.900\n about this positron plus or minus, you know,\n\n1:03:21.900 --> 1:03:24.180\n it was beginning to sound a little bit like,\n\n1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.900\n oh yeah, not only I have to have 10 dimension,\n\n1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:28.660\n but I have to have this, I have to also this.\n\n1:03:28.660 --> 1:03:31.140\n And so conservative physicists would say,\n\n1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:34.340\n hmm, you know, I haven't seen these experiments.\n\n1:03:34.340 --> 1:03:35.860\n I don't know if they are really there.\n\n1:03:35.860 --> 1:03:37.740\n Are you pulling my leg?\n\n1:03:37.740 --> 1:03:40.480\n Do you want me to imagine things that are not there?\n\n1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:42.900\n So this was an attitude of some physicists\n\n1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:45.380\n towards string theory, despite the fact\n\n1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:47.620\n that the puzzle of gravity and quantum mechanics\n\n1:03:47.620 --> 1:03:50.900\n merging together work, but still was this skepticism.\n\n1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:52.540\n You're putting all these things that you want me\n\n1:03:52.540 --> 1:03:54.220\n to imagine there, these extra dimensions\n\n1:03:54.220 --> 1:03:56.020\n that I cannot see, aha, aha.\n\n1:03:56.020 --> 1:03:57.260\n And you want me to believe that string\n\n1:03:57.260 --> 1:03:59.060\n that you have not even seen the experiments are real,\n\n1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:01.140\n aha, okay, what else do you want me to believe?\n\n1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:03.380\n So this kind of beginning to sound a little funny.\n\n1:04:03.380 --> 1:04:07.140\n Now, I will pass forward a little bit further.\n\n1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:11.300\n A few decades later, when string theory became\n\n1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:13.980\n the mainstream of efforts to unify the forces\n\n1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:16.500\n and particles together, we learned\n\n1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:20.780\n that these extra dimensions actually solved problems.\n\n1:04:20.780 --> 1:04:24.380\n They weren't a nuisance the way they originally appeared.\n\n1:04:24.380 --> 1:04:28.020\n First of all, the properties of these extra dimensions\n\n1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:31.460\n reflected the number of particles we got in four dimensions.\n\n1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:34.280\n If you took these six dimensions to have like five holes\n\n1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:37.020\n or four holes, change the number of particles\n\n1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:39.460\n that you see in four dimensional space time,\n\n1:04:39.460 --> 1:04:42.060\n you get one electron and one muon if you had this,\n\n1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:44.580\n but if you did the other J shape, you get something else.\n\n1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:47.700\n So geometrically, you could get different kinds of physics.\n\n1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:51.860\n So it was kind of a mirroring of geometry by physics\n\n1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.400\n down in the macroscopic space.\n\n1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:56.780\n So these extra dimension were becoming useful.\n\n1:04:56.780 --> 1:04:58.820\n Fine, but we didn't need the extra dimension\n\n1:04:58.820 --> 1:05:00.620\n to just write an electron in three dimensions,\n\n1:05:00.620 --> 1:05:02.820\n we did rewrote it, so what?\n\n1:05:02.820 --> 1:05:04.260\n Was there any other puzzle?\n\n1:05:04.260 --> 1:05:07.140\n Yes, there were, Hawking.\n\n1:05:07.140 --> 1:05:09.700\n Hawking had been studying black holes in mid 70s\n\n1:05:10.900 --> 1:05:12.840\n following the work of Bekenstein,\n\n1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:17.840\n who had predicted that black holes have entropy.\n\n1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:20.260\n So Bekenstein had tried to attach the entropy\n\n1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:21.540\n to the black hole.\n\n1:05:21.540 --> 1:05:23.860\n If you throw something into the black hole,\n\n1:05:23.860 --> 1:05:25.320\n the entropy seems to go down\n\n1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:28.020\n because you had something entropy outside the black hole\n\n1:05:28.020 --> 1:05:30.740\n and you throw it, black hole was unique,\n\n1:05:30.740 --> 1:05:33.500\n so the entropy did not have any, black hole had no entropy.\n\n1:05:33.500 --> 1:05:35.980\n So the entropy seemed to go down.\n\n1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:38.040\n And so that's against the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n1:05:38.040 --> 1:05:40.040\n So Bekenstein was trying to say, no, no,\n\n1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:42.140\n therefore black hole must have an entropy.\n\n1:05:42.140 --> 1:05:43.860\n So he was trying to understand that he found that\n\n1:05:43.860 --> 1:05:47.180\n if you assign entropy to be proportional\n\n1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:49.220\n to the area of the black hole, it seems to work.\n\n1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:52.640\n And then Hawking found not only that's correct,\n\n1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:54.940\n he found the correct proportionality factor\n\n1:05:54.940 --> 1:05:57.060\n of a one quarter of the area and Planck units\n\n1:05:57.060 --> 1:05:59.400\n is the correct amount of entropy.\n\n1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:01.100\n And he gave an argument using\n\n1:06:01.100 --> 1:06:03.300\n quantum semi classical arguments,\n\n1:06:03.300 --> 1:06:05.660\n which means basically using a little bit\n\n1:06:05.660 --> 1:06:06.880\n of a quantum mechanics,\n\n1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:09.020\n because he didn't have the full quantum mechanics\n\n1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:11.060\n of string theory, he could do some aspects\n\n1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:12.940\n of approximate quantum arguments.\n\n1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:14.860\n So he heuristic quantum arguments led\n\n1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:16.540\n to this entropy formula.\n\n1:06:17.400 --> 1:06:20.780\n But then he didn't answer the following question.\n\n1:06:20.780 --> 1:06:23.380\n He was getting a big entropy for the black hole,\n\n1:06:23.380 --> 1:06:25.020\n the black hole with the size of the horizon\n\n1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.700\n of a black hole is huge, has a huge amount of entropy.\n\n1:06:27.700 --> 1:06:29.660\n What are the microstates of this entropy?\n\n1:06:29.660 --> 1:06:32.260\n When you say, for example, the gas is entropy,\n\n1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:33.780\n you count where the atoms are,\n\n1:06:33.780 --> 1:06:35.540\n you count this bucket or that bucket,\n\n1:06:35.540 --> 1:06:38.660\n there's an information about there and so on, you count them.\n\n1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:40.820\n For the black hole, the way Hawking was thinking,\n\n1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:43.180\n there was no degree of freedom, you throw them in,\n\n1:06:43.180 --> 1:06:44.500\n and there was just one solution.\n\n1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.700\n So where are these entropy?\n\n1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:49.060\n What are these microscopic states?\n\n1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.940\n They were hidden somewhere.\n\n1:06:51.940 --> 1:06:54.340\n So later in string theory,\n\n1:06:54.340 --> 1:06:57.620\n the work that we did with my colleague Strominger,\n\n1:06:57.620 --> 1:07:00.500\n in particular showed that these ingredients\n\n1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:04.340\n in string theory of black hole arise\n\n1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:06.080\n from the extra dimensions.\n\n1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:08.300\n So the degrees of freedom are hidden\n\n1:07:08.300 --> 1:07:10.020\n in terms of things like strings,\n\n1:07:10.020 --> 1:07:13.660\n wrapping these extra circles in these hidden dimensions.\n\n1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:16.020\n And then we started counting how many ways\n\n1:07:16.020 --> 1:07:18.180\n like the strings can wrap around this circle\n\n1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:19.960\n and the extra dimension or that circle\n\n1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:22.460\n and counted the microscopic degrees of freedom.\n\n1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:24.780\n And lo and behold, we got the microscopic degrees\n\n1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:27.760\n of freedom that Hawking was predicting four dimensions.\n\n1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:30.180\n So the extra dimensions became useful\n\n1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.820\n for resolving a puzzle in four dimensions.\n\n1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:35.340\n The puzzle was where are the degrees of freedom\n\n1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:36.680\n of the black hole hidden?\n\n1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:39.300\n The answer, hidden in the extra dimensions.\n\n1:07:39.300 --> 1:07:41.020\n The tiny extra dimensions.\n\n1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:43.820\n So then by this time, it was beginning to,\n\n1:07:43.820 --> 1:07:46.160\n we see aspects that extra dimensions\n\n1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:47.340\n are useful for many things.\n\n1:07:47.340 --> 1:07:48.720\n It's not a nuisance.\n\n1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:51.180\n It wasn't to be kind of, you know, be ashamed of.\n\n1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:53.540\n It was actually in the welcome features.\n\n1:07:53.540 --> 1:07:54.900\n New feature, nevertheless.\n\n1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:59.580\n How do you intuit the 10 dimensional world?\n\n1:07:59.580 --> 1:08:03.140\n So yes, it's a feature for describing certain phenomena\n\n1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:06.380\n like the entropy in black holes,\n\n1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:11.380\n but what you said that to you a theory becomes real\n\n1:08:14.020 --> 1:08:16.380\n or becomes powerful when you can connect it\n\n1:08:16.380 --> 1:08:18.200\n to some deep intuition.\n\n1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:20.580\n So how do we intuit 10 dimensions?\n\n1:08:20.580 --> 1:08:24.820\n Yes, so I will explain how some of the analogies work.\n\n1:08:24.820 --> 1:08:27.840\n First of all, we do a lot of analogies.\n\n1:08:28.740 --> 1:08:31.020\n And by analogies, we build intuition.\n\n1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:33.260\n So I will start with this example.\n\n1:08:33.260 --> 1:08:37.500\n I will try to explain that if we are in 10 dimensional space,\n\n1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:40.260\n if we have a seven dimensional plane\n\n1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:41.900\n and eight dimensional plane,\n\n1:08:42.860 --> 1:08:45.580\n we ask typically in what space do they intersect each other\n\n1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:46.720\n in what dimension?\n\n1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:48.040\n That might sound like,\n\n1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:50.540\n how do you possibly give an answer to this?\n\n1:08:50.540 --> 1:08:52.440\n So we start with lower dimensions.\n\n1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:53.620\n We start with two dimensions.\n\n1:08:53.620 --> 1:08:56.540\n We say, if you have one dimension and a point,\n\n1:08:56.540 --> 1:08:58.600\n do they intersect typically on a plane?\n\n1:08:58.600 --> 1:08:59.440\n The answer is no.\n\n1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:02.980\n So a line one dimensional, a point zero dimension\n\n1:09:02.980 --> 1:09:05.780\n on a two dimensional plane, they don't typically meet.\n\n1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:08.540\n But if you have a one dimensional line and another line,\n\n1:09:08.540 --> 1:09:10.540\n which is one plus one on a plane,\n\n1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:13.620\n they typically intersect at a point.\n\n1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:15.140\n Typically means if you're not parallel,\n\n1:09:15.140 --> 1:09:17.100\n typically they intersect at a point.\n\n1:09:17.100 --> 1:09:20.620\n So one plus one is two and in two dimension,\n\n1:09:20.620 --> 1:09:23.020\n they intersect at the zero dimensional point.\n\n1:09:23.020 --> 1:09:25.740\n So you see two dimension, one and one, two,\n\n1:09:25.740 --> 1:09:26.900\n two minus two is zero.\n\n1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:29.860\n So you get point out of intersection.\n\n1:09:29.860 --> 1:09:31.860\n Let's go to three dimension.\n\n1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:33.860\n You have a plane, two dimensional plane and a point.\n\n1:09:33.860 --> 1:09:34.700\n Do they intersect?\n\n1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:35.860\n No, two and zero.\n\n1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:39.420\n How about the plane and a line?\n\n1:09:39.420 --> 1:09:41.420\n A plane is two dimensional and a line is one.\n\n1:09:41.420 --> 1:09:42.980\n Two plus one is three.\n\n1:09:42.980 --> 1:09:47.000\n In three dimension, a plane and a line meet at points,\n\n1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:47.900\n which is zero dimensional.\n\n1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:49.700\n Three minus three is zero.\n\n1:09:49.700 --> 1:09:52.920\n Okay, so plane and a line intersect\n\n1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:54.060\n at a point in three dimension.\n\n1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:56.020\n How about the plane and a plane in 3D?\n\n1:09:56.020 --> 1:09:57.660\n Well, plane is two and this is two.\n\n1:09:57.660 --> 1:09:59.160\n Two plus two is four.\n\n1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.040\n In 3D, four minus three is one.\n\n1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.100\n They intersect on a one dimensional line.\n\n1:10:03.100 --> 1:10:04.540\n Okay, we're beginning to see the pattern.\n\n1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:06.060\n Okay, now come to the question.\n\n1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:06.900\n We're in 10 dimension.\n\n1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:08.100\n Now we have the intuition.\n\n1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.380\n We have a seven dimensional plane\n\n1:10:09.380 --> 1:10:11.540\n and eight dimensional plane in 10 dimension.\n\n1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:13.140\n They intersect on a plane.\n\n1:10:13.140 --> 1:10:14.020\n What's the dimension?\n\n1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:16.860\n Well, seven plus eight is 15 minus 10 is five.\n\n1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:20.320\n We draw the same picture as two planes\n\n1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:22.520\n and we write seven dimension, eight dimension,\n\n1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:23.940\n but we have gotten the intuition\n\n1:10:23.940 --> 1:10:25.300\n from the lower dimensional one.\n\n1:10:25.300 --> 1:10:26.980\n What to expect?\n\n1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:28.660\n It doesn't scare us anymore.\n\n1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:30.220\n So we draw this picture.\n\n1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:32.700\n We cannot see all the seven dimensions\n\n1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:36.220\n by looking at this two dimensional visualization of it,\n\n1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:38.380\n but it has all the features we want.\n\n1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:39.900\n It has, so we draw this picture.\n\n1:10:39.900 --> 1:10:40.840\n It says seven, seven,\n\n1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:43.660\n and they meet at the five dimensional plane.\n\n1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:44.640\n It says five.\n\n1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.540\n So we have built this intuition.\n\n1:10:46.540 --> 1:10:51.540\n Now, this is an example of how we come up with intuition.\n\n1:10:51.860 --> 1:10:53.260\n Let me give you more examples of it\n\n1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:54.860\n because I think this will show you\n\n1:10:54.860 --> 1:10:57.900\n that people have to come up with intuitions to visualize it.\n\n1:10:57.900 --> 1:11:00.860\n Otherwise, we will be a little bit lost.\n\n1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:02.940\n So what you just described is kind of\n\n1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:04.280\n in these high dimensional spaces,\n\n1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.780\n focus on the meeting place of two planes\n\n1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:10.220\n in high dimensional spaces.\n\n1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:12.220\n Exactly, how the planes meet, for example,\n\n1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:14.760\n what's the dimension of their intersection and so on.\n\n1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:16.620\n So how do we come up with intuition?\n\n1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:19.580\n We borrow examples from lower dimensions,\n\n1:11:19.580 --> 1:11:21.940\n build up intuition and draw the same pictures\n\n1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:24.780\n as if we are talking about 10 dimensions,\n\n1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:26.860\n but we are drawing the same as a two dimensional plane\n\n1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:28.260\n because we cannot do any better.\n\n1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:32.540\n But our words change, but not our pictures.\n\n1:11:32.540 --> 1:11:35.820\n So your sense is we can have a deep understanding\n\n1:11:35.820 --> 1:11:39.220\n of reality by looking at its slices,\n\n1:11:39.220 --> 1:11:40.460\n at lower dimensional slices.\n\n1:11:40.460 --> 1:11:41.780\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:45.200\n And this brings me to the next example I wanna mention,\n\n1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.440\n which is sphere.\n\n1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:48.580\n Let's think about how do we think about the sphere?\n\n1:11:48.580 --> 1:11:51.460\n Well, the sphere is a sphere, the round nice thing,\n\n1:11:51.460 --> 1:11:53.520\n but sphere has a circular symmetry.\n\n1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:57.880\n Now, I can describe the sphere in the following way.\n\n1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:01.520\n I can describe it by an interval,\n\n1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:04.440\n which is thinking about this going from the north\n\n1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:06.360\n of the sphere to the south.\n\n1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:09.480\n And at each point, I have a circle attached to it.\n\n1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:11.440\n So you can think about the sphere as a line\n\n1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:13.920\n with a circle attached with each point,\n\n1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:17.520\n the circle shrinks to a point at end points\n\n1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:18.360\n of the interval.\n\n1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:21.920\n So I can say, oh, one way to think about the sphere\n\n1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:25.300\n is an interval where at each point on that interval,\n\n1:12:25.300 --> 1:12:27.280\n there's another circle I'm not drawing.\n\n1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:29.280\n But if you like, you can just draw it.\n\n1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:30.200\n Say, okay, I won't draw it.\n\n1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:32.520\n So from now on, there's this mnemonic.\n\n1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.640\n I draw an interval when I wanna talk about the sphere\n\n1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:37.240\n and you remember that the end points of the interval\n\n1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:39.320\n mean a strong circle, that's all.\n\n1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.280\n And they say, yeah, I see, that's a sphere, good.\n\n1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:44.300\n Now, we wanna talk about the product of two spheres.\n\n1:12:44.300 --> 1:12:47.040\n That's four dimensional, how can I visualize it?\n\n1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:50.900\n Easy, you just take an interval and another interval,\n\n1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:52.360\n that's just gonna be a square.\n\n1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.600\n A square is a four dimensional space, yeah, why is that?\n\n1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:02.160\n Well, at each point on the square, there's two circles,\n\n1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:04.840\n one for each of those directions you drew.\n\n1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:07.080\n And when you get to the boundaries of each direction,\n\n1:13:07.080 --> 1:13:09.920\n one of the circles shrink on each edge of that square.\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:11.680\n And when you get to the corners of the square,\n\n1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:13.660\n all both circles shrink.\n\n1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:17.480\n This is a sphere times a sphere, I have defined interval.\n\n1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.240\n I just described for you a four dimensional space.\n\n1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:21.640\n Do you want a six dimensional space?\n\n1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:25.780\n No problem, take a corner of a room.\n\n1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:28.160\n In fact, if you want to have a sphere times a sphere\n\n1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:31.200\n times a sphere times a sphere, take a cube.\n\n1:13:32.360 --> 1:13:36.800\n A cube is a rendition of this six dimensional space,\n\n1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:39.320\n two sphere times another sphere times another sphere,\n\n1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:41.860\n where three of the circles I'm not drawing for you.\n\n1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:43.720\n For each one of those directions, there's another circle.\n\n1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:45.880\n But each time you get to the boundary of the cube,\n\n1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:47.080\n one circle shrinks.\n\n1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:48.760\n When the boundaries meet, two circles shrinks.\n\n1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:51.960\n When three boundaries meet, all the three circles shrink.\n\n1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:53.320\n So I just give you a picture.\n\n1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.900\n Now, mathematicians come up with amazing things.\n\n1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:58.080\n Like, you know what, I want to take a point in space\n\n1:13:58.080 --> 1:13:59.400\n and blow it up.\n\n1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:01.920\n You know, these concepts like topology and geometry,\n\n1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:03.520\n complicated, how do you do?\n\n1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:05.360\n In this picture, it's very easy.\n\n1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:07.840\n Blow it up in this picture means the following.\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:10.280\n You think about this cube, you go to the corner\n\n1:14:10.280 --> 1:14:12.640\n and you chop off a corner.\n\n1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:15.160\n Chopping off the corner replaces the point.\n\n1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:16.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:17.160\n Replace the point by a triangle.\n\n1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:18.000\n Yes.\n\n1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.760\n So you're blowing up a point and then this triangle\n\n1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:22.320\n is what they call P2, projective two space.\n\n1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:25.040\n But these pictures are very physical and you feel it.\n\n1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:26.280\n There's nothing amazing.\n\n1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:28.040\n I'm not talking about six dimension.\n\n1:14:28.040 --> 1:14:30.520\n Four plus six is 10, the dimension of string theory.\n\n1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.280\n So we can visualize it, no problem.\n\n1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:34.280\n Okay, so that's building the intuition\n\n1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:36.860\n to a complicated world of string theory.\n\n1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:39.940\n Nevertheless, these objects are really small.\n\n1:14:39.940 --> 1:14:42.520\n And just like you said, experimental validation\n\n1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:45.360\n is very difficult because the objects are way smaller\n\n1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:48.320\n than anything that we currently have the tools\n\n1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:53.320\n and accelerators and so on to reveal through experiment.\n\n1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.280\n So there's a kind of skepticism\n\n1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:59.340\n that's not just about the nature of the theory\n\n1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:01.800\n because of the 10 dimensions, as you've explained,\n\n1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:05.000\n but in that we can't experimentally validate it\n\n1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.480\n and it doesn't necessarily, to date,\n\n1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:09.000\n maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.040\n predict something fundamentally new.\n\n1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:16.080\n So it's beautiful as an explaining theory,\n\n1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:18.200\n which means that it's very possible\n\n1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:19.880\n that it is a fundamental theory\n\n1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.580\n that describes reality and unifies the laws,\n\n1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.500\n but there's still a kind of skepticism.\n\n1:15:25.500 --> 1:15:30.500\n And me, from sort of an outside observer perspective,\n\n1:15:30.900 --> 1:15:34.320\n have been observing a little bit of a growing cynicism\n\n1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:37.300\n about string theory in the recent few years.\n\n1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:40.080\n Can you describe the cynicism about,\n\n1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.760\n sort of by cynicism I mean a cynicism\n\n1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:46.440\n about the hope for this theory\n\n1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:49.840\n of pushing theoretical physics forward?\n\n1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:50.800\n Yes.\n\n1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:53.960\n Can you do describe why this is cynicism\n\n1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:56.040\n and how do we reverse that trend?\n\n1:15:56.040 --> 1:16:00.500\n Yes, first of all, the criticism for string theory\n\n1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:04.600\n is healthy in a sense that in science\n\n1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:07.260\n we have to have different viewpoints and that's good.\n\n1:16:07.260 --> 1:16:12.260\n So I welcome criticism and the reason for criticism\n\n1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:13.880\n and I think that is a valid reason\n\n1:16:13.880 --> 1:16:15.880\n is that there has been zero experimental evidence\n\n1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:17.120\n for string theory.\n\n1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:20.300\n That is no experiment has been done\n\n1:16:20.300 --> 1:16:24.080\n to show that there's this loop of energy moving around.\n\n1:16:24.080 --> 1:16:28.520\n And so that's a valid objection and valid worry.\n\n1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.240\n And if I were to say, you know what,\n\n1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:31.800\n string theory can never be verified\n\n1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:34.480\n or experimentally checked, that's the way it is,\n\n1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:36.280\n they would have every right to say\n\n1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:37.840\n what you're talking about is not science.\n\n1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:39.740\n Because in science we will have to have\n\n1:16:39.740 --> 1:16:42.360\n experimental consequences and checks.\n\n1:16:42.360 --> 1:16:44.600\n The difference between string theory\n\n1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:45.780\n and something which is not scientific\n\n1:16:45.780 --> 1:16:47.660\n is that string theory has predictions.\n\n1:16:47.660 --> 1:16:49.660\n The problem is that the predictions we have today\n\n1:16:49.660 --> 1:16:52.960\n of string theory is hard to access by experiments\n\n1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:55.220\n available with the energies we can achieve\n\n1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:56.680\n with the colliders today.\n\n1:16:56.680 --> 1:16:58.360\n It doesn't mean there's a problem with string theory,\n\n1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.640\n it just means technologically we're not that far ahead.\n\n1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:04.320\n Now, we can have two attitudes.\n\n1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:06.780\n You say, well, if that's the case, why are you studying\n\n1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:07.620\n this subject?\n\n1:17:07.620 --> 1:17:09.440\n Because you can't do experiment today.\n\n1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:12.480\n Now, this is becoming a little bit more like mathematics\n\n1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:13.320\n in that sense.\n\n1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:15.400\n You say, well, I want to learn,\n\n1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:16.680\n I want to know how the nature works\n\n1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:18.520\n even though I cannot prove it today\n\n1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:21.060\n that this is it because of experiments.\n\n1:17:21.060 --> 1:17:24.240\n That should not prevent my mind not to think about it.\n\n1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:26.260\n So that's the attitude many string theorists follow,\n\n1:17:26.260 --> 1:17:28.220\n that it should be like this.\n\n1:17:28.220 --> 1:17:30.940\n Now, so that's an answer to the criticism,\n\n1:17:30.940 --> 1:17:33.000\n but there's actually a better answer to the criticism,\n\n1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.120\n I would say.\n\n1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:37.440\n We don't have experimental evidence for string theory,\n\n1:17:37.440 --> 1:17:39.320\n but we have theoretical evidence for string theory.\n\n1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:41.640\n And what do I mean by theoretical evidence\n\n1:17:41.640 --> 1:17:42.920\n for string theory?\n\n1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:45.260\n String theory has connected different parts\n\n1:17:45.260 --> 1:17:46.320\n of physics together.\n\n1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:48.680\n It didn't have to.\n\n1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:52.160\n It has brought connections between part of physics,\n\n1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:53.600\n although suppose you're just interested\n\n1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:54.760\n in particle physics.\n\n1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:57.880\n Suppose you're not even interested in gravity at all.\n\n1:17:57.880 --> 1:17:59.720\n It turns out there are properties\n\n1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:02.360\n of certain particle physics models\n\n1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:06.080\n that string theory has been able to solve using gravity,\n\n1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:08.200\n using ideas from string theory,\n\n1:18:08.200 --> 1:18:10.680\n ideas known as holography,\n\n1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:13.160\n which is relating something which has to do with particles\n\n1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:15.600\n to something having to do with gravity.\n\n1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:17.760\n Why did it have to be this rich?\n\n1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:20.240\n The subject is very rich.\n\n1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:23.000\n It's not something we were smart enough to develop.\n\n1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:23.840\n It came at us.\n\n1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:24.660\n As I explained to you,\n\n1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:25.720\n the development of string theory\n\n1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.080\n came from accidental discovery.\n\n1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:29.760\n It wasn't because we were smart enough\n\n1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:30.840\n to come up with the idea,\n\n1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:32.360\n oh yeah, string of course has gravity in it.\n\n1:18:32.360 --> 1:18:34.480\n No, it was accidental discovery.\n\n1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:36.160\n So some people say it's not fair to say\n\n1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:38.120\n we have no evidence for string theory.\n\n1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:41.280\n Graviton, gravity is an evidence for string theory.\n\n1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:43.280\n It's predicted by string theory.\n\n1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:45.840\n We didn't put it by hand, we got it.\n\n1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:47.920\n So there's a qualitative check.\n\n1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:51.080\n Okay, gravity is a prediction of string theory.\n\n1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:53.640\n It's a postdiction because we know gravity existed.\n\n1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:56.760\n But still, logically it is a prediction\n\n1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:00.000\n because really we didn't know it had the graviton\n\n1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.760\n that we later learned that, oh, that's the same as gravity.\n\n1:19:02.760 --> 1:19:04.480\n So literally that's the way it was discovered.\n\n1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:06.280\n It wasn't put in by hand.\n\n1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:08.480\n So there are many things like that,\n\n1:19:08.480 --> 1:19:11.480\n that there are different facets of physics,\n\n1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:13.400\n like questions in condensed matter physics,\n\n1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:15.280\n questions of particle physics,\n\n1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.060\n questions about this and that have come together\n\n1:19:18.060 --> 1:19:21.320\n to find beautiful answers by using ideas\n\n1:19:21.320 --> 1:19:24.320\n from string theory at the same time\n\n1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.080\n as a lot of new math has emerged.\n\n1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:29.660\n That's an aspect which I wouldn't emphasize\n\n1:19:29.660 --> 1:19:31.920\n as evidence to physicists necessarily,\n\n1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:33.860\n because they would say, okay, great, you got some math,\n\n1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:35.580\n but what's it do with reality?\n\n1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:38.680\n But as I explained, many of the physical principles\n\n1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.700\n we know of have beautiful math underpinning them.\n\n1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:45.200\n So it certainly leads further confidence\n\n1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:46.820\n that we may not be going astray,\n\n1:19:46.820 --> 1:19:49.200\n even though that's not the full proof as we know.\n\n1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:52.280\n So there are these aspects that give further evidence\n\n1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:55.300\n for string theory, connections between each other,\n\n1:19:55.300 --> 1:19:56.260\n connection with the real world,\n\n1:19:56.260 --> 1:19:58.480\n but then there are other things that come about\n\n1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:01.120\n and I can try to give examples of that.\n\n1:20:01.120 --> 1:20:03.000\n So these are further evidences\n\n1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.840\n and these are certain predictions of string theory.\n\n1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:08.880\n They are not as detailed as we want,\n\n1:20:08.880 --> 1:20:10.520\n but there are still predictions.\n\n1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:14.920\n Why is the dimension of space and time three plus one?\n\n1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:20.160\n Say, I don't know, just deal with it, three plus one.\n\n1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:23.320\n But in physics, we want to know why.\n\n1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:26.520\n Well, take a random dimension from one to infinity.\n\n1:20:26.520 --> 1:20:28.740\n What's your random dimension?\n\n1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:32.180\n A random dimension from one to infinity would not be four.\n\n1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:35.640\n Eight would most likely be a humongous number,\n\n1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:36.480\n if not infinity.\n\n1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:39.640\n I mean, there's no, if you choose any reasonable distribution\n\n1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:41.340\n which goes from one to infinity,\n\n1:20:41.340 --> 1:20:43.200\n three or four would not be your pick.\n\n1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:45.900\n The fact that we are in three or four dimension\n\n1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:47.420\n is already strange.\n\n1:20:48.540 --> 1:20:49.880\n The fact that strings are sorry,\n\n1:20:49.880 --> 1:20:52.720\n I cannot go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something.\n\n1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.620\n The fact that there's this upper bound,\n\n1:20:54.620 --> 1:20:56.280\n the range is not from one to infinity,\n\n1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.720\n it's from one to 10 or 11 or whatnot,\n\n1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.720\n it already brings a natural prior.\n\n1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:03.200\n Oh yeah, three or four is just on the average.\n\n1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:05.120\n If you pick some of the compactification,\n\n1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:06.040\n then it could easily be that.\n\n1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:08.880\n So in other words, it makes it much more possible\n\n1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:11.080\n that it could be three of our universe.\n\n1:21:11.080 --> 1:21:14.240\n So the fact that the dimension already is so small,\n\n1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:16.000\n it should be surprising.\n\n1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.440\n We don't ask that question.\n\n1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.360\n We should be surprised because we could have conceived\n\n1:21:20.360 --> 1:21:22.440\n of universes with our pre dimension.\n\n1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:24.280\n Why is it that we have such a small dimension?\n\n1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:25.520\n That's number one.\n\n1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:28.760\n So good theory of the universe should give you\n\n1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:33.600\n an intuition of the why it's four or three plus one.\n\n1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.120\n And it's not obvious that it should be.\n\n1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:37.200\n That should be explained.\n\n1:21:37.200 --> 1:21:40.520\n We take that as an assumption,\n\n1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:43.360\n but that's a thing that should be explained.\n\n1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:45.040\n Yeah, so we haven't explained that in string theory.\n\n1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:47.440\n Actually, I did write a model within string theory\n\n1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:49.040\n to try to describe why we end up\n\n1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:52.520\n with three plus one space time dimensions,\n\n1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:54.720\n which are big compared to the rest of them.\n\n1:21:54.720 --> 1:21:57.000\n And even though this has not been,\n\n1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:00.240\n the technical difficulties to prove it is still not there,\n\n1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.640\n but I will explain the idea because the idea connects\n\n1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:05.360\n to some other piece of elegant math,\n\n1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:06.280\n which is the following.\n\n1:22:06.280 --> 1:22:11.280\n Consider a universe made of a box, three dimensional box.\n\n1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:13.280\n Or in fact, if we start in string theory,\n\n1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:14.280\n nine dimensional box,\n\n1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:17.200\n because we have nine spatial dimension on one time.\n\n1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:20.240\n So imagine a nine dimensional box.\n\n1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:23.880\n So we should imagine the box of a typical size of the string,\n\n1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.600\n which is small.\n\n1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.640\n So the universe would naturally start\n\n1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:29.640\n with a very tiny nine dimensional box.\n\n1:22:30.520 --> 1:22:31.400\n What do strings do?\n\n1:22:31.400 --> 1:22:34.000\n Well, strings go around the box\n\n1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.360\n and move around and vibrate and all that,\n\n1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:38.600\n but also they can wrap around one side of the box\n\n1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:41.400\n to the other because I'm imagining a box\n\n1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:42.760\n with periodic boundary conditions.\n\n1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:44.600\n So what we call the torus.\n\n1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:46.960\n So the string can go from one side to the other.\n\n1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:48.520\n This is what we call a winding string.\n\n1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:50.400\n The string can wind around the box.\n\n1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:54.200\n Now, suppose you have, you've now evolved the universe.\n\n1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:56.800\n Because there's energy, the universe starts to expand.\n\n1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:00.240\n But it doesn't expand too far.\n\n1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:01.320\n Why is it?\n\n1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:03.800\n Well, because there are these strings\n\n1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:04.720\n which are wrapped around\n\n1:23:04.720 --> 1:23:07.120\n from one side of the wall to the other.\n\n1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:10.440\n When the universe, the walls of the universe are growing,\n\n1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:11.960\n it is stretching the string\n\n1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:15.040\n and the strings are becoming very, very massive.\n\n1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:16.840\n So it becomes difficult to expand.\n\n1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:18.320\n It kind of puts a halt on it.\n\n1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:19.880\n In order to not put a halt,\n\n1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:21.280\n a string which is going this way\n\n1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:22.720\n and a string which is going that way\n\n1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:25.400\n should intersect each other\n\n1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:27.840\n and disconnect each other and unwind.\n\n1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:29.640\n So a string which winds this way\n\n1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:31.720\n and the string which finds the opposite way\n\n1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:35.400\n should find each other to reconnect\n\n1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:37.080\n and this way disappear.\n\n1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:40.560\n So if they find each other and they disappear.\n\n1:23:40.560 --> 1:23:42.120\n But how can strings find each other?\n\n1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:45.480\n Well, the string moves and another string moves.\n\n1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:48.600\n A string is one dimensional, one plus one is two\n\n1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:52.280\n and one plus one is two and two plus two is four.\n\n1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:55.600\n In four dimensional space time, they will find each other.\n\n1:23:55.600 --> 1:23:57.360\n In a higher dimensional space time,\n\n1:23:57.360 --> 1:23:59.400\n they typically miss each other.\n\n1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:00.240\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:01.800\n So if the dimension were too big,\n\n1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:02.800\n they would miss each other,\n\n1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:04.480\n they wouldn't be able to expand.\n\n1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:06.760\n So in order to expand, they have to find each other\n\n1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:08.920\n and three of them can find each other\n\n1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:10.960\n and those can expand and the other one will be stuck.\n\n1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:13.200\n So that explains why within string theory,\n\n1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:15.520\n these particular dimensions are really big\n\n1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:16.680\n and full of exciting stuff.\n\n1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:17.800\n That could be an explanation.\n\n1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:21.800\n That's a model we suggested with my colleague Brandenberger.\n\n1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:23.880\n But it turns out to be related to a deep piece of math.\n\n1:24:23.880 --> 1:24:26.800\n You see, for mathematicians,\n\n1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:30.120\n manifolds of dimension bigger than four are simple.\n\n1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:33.960\n Four dimension is the hardest dimension for math,\n\n1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:35.800\n it turns out.\n\n1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:38.680\n And it turns out the reason it's difficult is the following.\n\n1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:41.200\n It turns out that in higher dimension,\n\n1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:45.200\n you use what's called surgery in mathematical terminology,\n\n1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:48.200\n where you use these two dimensional tubes\n\n1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:50.440\n to maneuver them off of each other.\n\n1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:53.160\n So you have two plus two becoming four.\n\n1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.400\n In higher than four dimension,\n\n1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:56.240\n you can pass them through each other\n\n1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:57.920\n without them intersecting.\n\n1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:00.440\n In four dimension, two plus two\n\n1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:03.120\n doesn't allow you to pass them through each other.\n\n1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:05.280\n So the same techniques that work in higher dimension\n\n1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:08.280\n don't work in four dimension because two plus two is four.\n\n1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:10.160\n The same reasoning I was just telling you\n\n1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:12.760\n about strings finding each other in four\n\n1:25:12.760 --> 1:25:16.120\n ends up to be the reason why four is much more complicated\n\n1:25:16.120 --> 1:25:18.480\n to classify for mathematicians as well.\n\n1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:20.280\n So there might be these things.\n\n1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:22.840\n So I cannot say that this is the reason\n\n1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:25.080\n that string theory is giving you three plus one,\n\n1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:26.440\n but it could be a model for it.\n\n1:25:26.440 --> 1:25:28.320\n And so there are these kinds of ideas\n\n1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:31.440\n that could underlie why we have three extra dimensions\n\n1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:32.840\n which are large and the rest of them are small.\n\n1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:35.000\n But absolutely, we have to have a good reason.\n\n1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.080\n We cannot leave it like that.\n\n1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:38.320\n Can I ask a tricky human question?\n\n1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:42.480\n So you are one of the seminal figures in string theory.\n\n1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:44.000\n You got the Breakthrough Prize.\n\n1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.840\n You've worked with Edward Witten.\n\n1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:50.000\n There's no Nobel Prize that has been given on string theory.\n\n1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:54.080\n Credit assignment is tricky in science.\n\n1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:57.800\n It makes you quite sad, especially big, like LIGO,\n\n1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:01.440\n big experimental projects when so many incredible people\n\n1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:04.640\n have been involved and yet the Nobel Prize is annoying\n\n1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:06.640\n in that it's only given to three people.\n\n1:26:06.640 --> 1:26:08.760\n Who do you think gets the Nobel Prize\n\n1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:12.280\n for string theory at first?\n\n1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:17.280\n If it turns out that it, if not in full, then in part,\n\n1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:24.400\n is a good model of the way the physics of the universe works.\n\n1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:26.360\n Who are the key figures?\n\n1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.680\n Maybe let's put Nobel Prize aside.\n\n1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:29.520\n Who are the key figures?\n\n1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:31.480\n Okay, I like the second version of the question.\n\n1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:34.600\n Because I think to try to give a prize to one person\n\n1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:37.120\n in string theory doesn't do justice to the diversity\n\n1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:37.960\n of the subject.\n\n1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:38.800\n That to me is.\n\n1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:41.040\n So there was quite a lot of incredible people\n\n1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:41.880\n in the history of string theory.\n\n1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:43.200\n Quite a lot of people.\n\n1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:44.520\n I mean, starting with Veneziano,\n\n1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:46.120\n who wasn't talking about strings.\n\n1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:48.440\n I mean, he wrote down the beginning of the strings.\n\n1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:50.000\n We cannot ignore that for sure.\n\n1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.440\n And so you start with that and you go on\n\n1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:54.080\n with various other figures and so on.\n\n1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:56.280\n So there are different epochs in string theory\n\n1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:57.840\n and different people have been pushing it.\n\n1:26:57.840 --> 1:26:59.760\n And so for example, the early epoch,\n\n1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:02.640\n we just told you people like Veneziano,\n\n1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:05.480\n and Nambu, and the Susskind, and others were pushing it.\n\n1:27:05.480 --> 1:27:07.840\n Green and Schwarz were pushing it and so forth.\n\n1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:09.640\n So this was, or Scherck and so on.\n\n1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:13.040\n So these were the initial periods of pioneers,\n\n1:27:13.040 --> 1:27:14.600\n I would say, of string theory.\n\n1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:18.760\n And then there were the mid 80s that Edward Witten\n\n1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:20.600\n was the major proponent of string theory.\n\n1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.760\n And he really changed the landscape of string theory\n\n1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:26.080\n in terms of what people do and how we view it.\n\n1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:29.240\n And I think his efforts brought a lot of attention\n\n1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:31.560\n to the community of string theory.\n\n1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:34.640\n To the community about high energy community\n\n1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:37.080\n to focus on this effort as the correct theory\n\n1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:38.480\n of unification of forces.\n\n1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.120\n So he brought a lot of research as well as, of course,\n\n1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:44.440\n the first rate work he himself did to this area.\n\n1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.960\n So that's in mid 80s and onwards,\n\n1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:49.040\n and also in mid 90s where he was one of the proponents\n\n1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:51.640\n of the duality revolution in string theory.\n\n1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:54.240\n And with that came a lot of these other ideas\n\n1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:58.400\n that led to breakthroughs involving, for example,\n\n1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:00.920\n the example I told you about black holes and holography,\n\n1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:03.880\n and the work that was later done by Maldacena\n\n1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:06.600\n about the properties of duality between particle physics\n\n1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:10.160\n and quantum gravity and the deeper connections\n\n1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:12.920\n of holography, and it continues.\n\n1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:15.320\n And there are many people within this range,\n\n1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:16.600\n which I haven't even mentioned.\n\n1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:19.000\n They have done fantastic important things.\n\n1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:22.640\n How it gets recognized, I think, is secondary,\n\n1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:25.480\n in my opinion, than the appreciation\n\n1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:27.680\n that the effort is collective.\n\n1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:30.400\n That, in fact, that to me is the more important part\n\n1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:32.200\n of science that gets forgotten.\n\n1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:35.160\n For some reason, humanity likes heroes,\n\n1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:36.400\n and science is no exception.\n\n1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:40.480\n We like heroes, but I personally try to avoid that trap.\n\n1:28:40.480 --> 1:28:44.840\n I feel, in my work, most of my work is with colleagues.\n\n1:28:44.840 --> 1:28:49.240\n I have much more collaborations than sole author papers,\n\n1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:51.880\n and I enjoy it, and I think that that's, to me,\n\n1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:54.320\n one of the most satisfying aspects of science\n\n1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:59.240\n is to interact and learn and debate ideas with colleagues\n\n1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:02.040\n because that influx of ideas enriches it,\n\n1:29:02.040 --> 1:29:05.680\n and that's why I find it interesting.\n\n1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:08.240\n To me, science, if I was on an island,\n\n1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.360\n and if I was developing string theory by myself\n\n1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:11.800\n and had nothing to do with anybody,\n\n1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:14.120\n it would be much less satisfying, in my opinion.\n\n1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:17.120\n Even if I could take credit I did it,\n\n1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:18.320\n it won't be as satisfying.\n\n1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:22.640\n Sitting alone with a big metal drinking champagne, no.\n\n1:29:22.640 --> 1:29:25.720\n I think, to me, the collective work is more exciting,\n\n1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:28.280\n and you mentioned my getting the breakthrough.\n\n1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:30.480\n When I was getting it, I made sure to mention\n\n1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:32.280\n that it is because of the joint work\n\n1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:33.760\n that I've done with colleagues.\n\n1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:36.800\n At that time, it was around 180 or so collaborators,\n\n1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:39.720\n and I acknowledged them in the webpage for them.\n\n1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:41.120\n I write all of their names\n\n1:29:41.120 --> 1:29:42.640\n and the collaborations that led to this.\n\n1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:46.520\n So, to me, science is fun when it's collaboration,\n\n1:29:46.520 --> 1:29:48.720\n and yes, there are more important\n\n1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:51.200\n and less important figures, as in any field,\n\n1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:53.280\n and that's true, that's true in string theory as well,\n\n1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:55.880\n but I think that I would like to view this\n\n1:29:55.880 --> 1:29:56.920\n as a collective effort.\n\n1:29:56.920 --> 1:30:00.480\n So, setting the heroes aside,\n\n1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:04.200\n the Nobel Prize is a celebration of,\n\n1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:05.720\n what's the right way to put it,\n\n1:30:05.720 --> 1:30:08.200\n that this idea turned out to be right.\n\n1:30:08.200 --> 1:30:11.560\n So, like, you look at Einstein\n\n1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:13.720\n didn't believe in black holes,\n\n1:30:13.720 --> 1:30:17.800\n and then black holes got their Nobel Prize.\n\n1:30:17.800 --> 1:30:22.040\n Do you think string theory will get its Nobel Prize,\n\n1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:25.400\n Nobel Prizes, if you were to bet money?\n\n1:30:25.400 --> 1:30:27.800\n If this was an investment meeting\n\n1:30:27.800 --> 1:30:29.960\n and we had to bet all our money,\n\n1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:31.960\n do you think he gets the Nobel Prizes?\n\n1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:34.520\n I think it's possible that none of the living physicists\n\n1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:35.960\n will get the Nobel Prize in string theory,\n\n1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:37.080\n but somebody will.\n\n1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:41.560\n Because, unfortunately, the technology available today\n\n1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:43.040\n is not very encouraging\n\n1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:46.280\n in terms of seeing directly evidence for string theory.\n\n1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:48.280\n Do you think it ultimately boils down to\n\n1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:49.600\n the Nobel Prize will be given\n\n1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:53.240\n when there is some direct or indirect evidence?\n\n1:30:53.240 --> 1:30:55.960\n There would be, but I think that part of this\n\n1:30:55.960 --> 1:30:58.760\n breakthrough prize was precisely the appreciation\n\n1:30:58.760 --> 1:31:01.440\n that when we have sufficient evidence,\n\n1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:04.160\n theoretical as it is, not experiment,\n\n1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:06.200\n because of this technology lag,\n\n1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:08.920\n you appreciate what you think is the correct path.\n\n1:31:08.920 --> 1:31:12.520\n So, there are many people who have been recognized precisely\n\n1:31:12.520 --> 1:31:14.000\n because they may not be around\n\n1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.120\n when it actually gets experimented,\n\n1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:17.840\n even though they discovered it.\n\n1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:19.840\n So, there are many things like that\n\n1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:21.480\n that's going on in science.\n\n1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:25.600\n So, I think that I would want to attach less significance\n\n1:31:25.600 --> 1:31:28.240\n to the recognitions of people.\n\n1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:31.080\n And I have a second review on this,\n\n1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:35.560\n which is there are people who look at these works\n\n1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:37.480\n that people have done and put them together\n\n1:31:37.480 --> 1:31:39.960\n and make the next big breakthrough.\n\n1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:43.800\n And they get identified with, perhaps rightly,\n\n1:31:43.800 --> 1:31:47.960\n with many of these new visions.\n\n1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:51.360\n But they are on the shoulders of these little scientists.\n\n1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:54.040\n Which don't get any recognition.\n\n1:31:54.040 --> 1:31:55.480\n You know, yeah, you did this little work.\n\n1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:56.920\n Oh yeah, you did this little work.\n\n1:31:56.920 --> 1:31:57.760\n Oh yeah, yeah, five of you.\n\n1:31:57.760 --> 1:31:59.280\n Oh yeah, these showed this pattern.\n\n1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:01.800\n And then somebody else, it's not fair.\n\n1:32:01.800 --> 1:32:05.720\n To me, those little guys, which kind of like,\n\n1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:07.440\n like seem to do the little calculation here,\n\n1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:10.120\n a little thing there, which doesn't rise to the occasion\n\n1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:11.800\n of this grandiose kind of thing,\n\n1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:15.120\n doesn't make it to the New York Times headlines and so on,\n\n1:32:15.120 --> 1:32:17.080\n deserve a lot of recognition.\n\n1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:18.400\n And I think they don't get enough.\n\n1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.960\n I would say that there should be this Nobel prize\n\n1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:23.920\n for, you know, they have these Doctors Without Borders,\n\n1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:24.760\n they're a huge group.\n\n1:32:24.760 --> 1:32:25.600\n They should do a similar thing.\n\n1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:27.800\n And these String Theors Without Borders kind of,\n\n1:32:27.800 --> 1:32:29.320\n everybody is doing a lot of work.\n\n1:32:29.320 --> 1:32:32.880\n And I think that I would like to see that effort recognized.\n\n1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:35.480\n I think in the long arc of history,\n\n1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:38.080\n we're all little guys and girls\n\n1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:40.640\n standing on the shoulders of each other.\n\n1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:44.560\n I mean, it's all going to look tiny in retrospect.\n\n1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:46.960\n If we celebrate, the New York Times,\n\n1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:51.040\n you know, as a newspaper,\n\n1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:55.000\n or the idea of a newspaper in a few centuries from now\n\n1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.200\n will be long forgotten.\n\n1:32:56.200 --> 1:32:57.680\n Yes, I agree with that.\n\n1:32:57.680 --> 1:32:59.000\n Especially in the context of String Theory,\n\n1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.840\n we should have a very long term view.\n\n1:33:00.840 --> 1:33:01.960\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:05.360\n Just as a tiny tangent, we mentioned Edward Witten.\n\n1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:09.800\n And he, in a bunch of walks of life for me as an outsider,\n\n1:33:09.800 --> 1:33:14.200\n comes up as a person who is widely considered as like\n\n1:33:14.200 --> 1:33:17.920\n one of the most brilliant people in the history of physics,\n\n1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:21.520\n just as a powerhouse of a human,\n\n1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:26.520\n like the exceptional places that a human mind can rise to.\n\n1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:28.120\n Yes.\n\n1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:29.720\n You've gotten the chance to work with him.\n\n1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:30.560\n What's he like?\n\n1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:31.400\n Yes, more than that.\n\n1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:34.240\n He was my advisor, PhD advisor.\n\n1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:35.920\n So I got to know him very well\n\n1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:37.480\n and I benefited from his insights.\n\n1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:40.080\n In fact, what you said about him is accurate.\n\n1:33:40.080 --> 1:33:42.280\n He is not only brilliant,\n\n1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:46.560\n but he is also multifaceted in terms of the impact\n\n1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:49.520\n he has had in not only physics, but also mathematics.\n\n1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:50.880\n He has gotten the Fields Medal\n\n1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.440\n because of his work in mathematics.\n\n1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:57.440\n And rightly so, he has used his knowledge of physics\n\n1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:01.640\n in a way which impacted deep ideas in modern mathematics.\n\n1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:05.960\n And that's an example of the power of these ideas\n\n1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:08.680\n in modern high energy physics and string theory,\n\n1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:11.600\n the applicability of it to modern mathematics.\n\n1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:16.360\n So he's quite an exceptional individual.\n\n1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:19.560\n We don't come across such people a lot in history.\n\n1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:20.680\n So I think, yes, indeed,\n\n1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.120\n he's one of the rare figures in this history of subject.\n\n1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:26.480\n He has had great impact on a lot of aspects\n\n1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:27.320\n of not just string theory,\n\n1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.360\n a lot of different areas in physics,\n\n1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:32.720\n and also, yes, in mathematics as well.\n\n1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:34.960\n So I think what you said about him is accurate.\n\n1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.560\n I had the pleasure of interacting with him as a student\n\n1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:40.680\n and later on as colleagues writing papers together\n\n1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:41.520\n and so on.\n\n1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:43.160\n What impact did he have on your life?\n\n1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:46.040\n Like what have you learned from him?\n\n1:34:46.040 --> 1:34:48.200\n If you were to look at the trajectory of your mind\n\n1:34:48.200 --> 1:34:51.520\n of the way you approach science and physics and mathematics,\n\n1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:54.360\n how did he perturb that trajectory in a way?\n\n1:34:54.360 --> 1:34:55.600\n Yes, he did actually.\n\n1:34:55.600 --> 1:34:57.680\n So I can explain because when I was a student,\n\n1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:00.120\n I had the biggest impact by him,\n\n1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.400\n clearly as a grad student at Princeton.\n\n1:35:02.400 --> 1:35:06.640\n So I think that was a time where I was a little bit confused\n\n1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.760\n about the relation between math and physics.\n\n1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:11.280\n I got a double major in mathematics and physics\n\n1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:14.600\n at MIT because I really enjoyed both.\n\n1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:18.280\n And I liked the elegance and the rigor of mathematics.\n\n1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:21.160\n And I liked the power of ideas in physics\n\n1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:22.760\n and its applicability to reality\n\n1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:26.360\n and what it teaches about the real world around us.\n\n1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:30.200\n But I saw this tension between rigorous thinking\n\n1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:33.440\n in mathematics and lack thereof in physics.\n\n1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:36.240\n And this troubled me to no end.\n\n1:35:36.240 --> 1:35:38.000\n I was troubled by that.\n\n1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.680\n So I was at crossroads when I decided\n\n1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:42.200\n to go to graduate school in physics\n\n1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:44.800\n because I did not like some of the lack of rigors\n\n1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:46.000\n I was seeing in physics.\n\n1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:48.840\n On the other hand, to me, mathematics,\n\n1:35:48.840 --> 1:35:49.920\n even though it was rigorous,\n\n1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:53.040\n I didn't see the point of it.\n\n1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:57.400\n In other words, the math theorem by itself could be beautiful\n\n1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:58.760\n but I really wanted more than that.\n\n1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:00.320\n I wanted to say, okay, what does it teach us\n\n1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:02.880\n about something else, something more than just math?\n\n1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:05.240\n So I wasn't that enamored with just math\n\n1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:07.320\n but physics was a little bit bothersome.\n\n1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:08.960\n Nevertheless, I decided to go to physics\n\n1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:10.840\n and I decided to go to Princeton\n\n1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:13.280\n and I started working with Edward Witten\n\n1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:14.920\n as my thesis advisor.\n\n1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:20.480\n And at that time I was trying to put physics\n\n1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:22.400\n in rigorous mathematical terms.\n\n1:36:22.400 --> 1:36:23.840\n I took quantum field theory.\n\n1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:26.800\n I tried to make rigorous out of it and so on.\n\n1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:29.080\n And no matter how hard I was trying,\n\n1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:31.760\n I was not being able to do that.\n\n1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:33.760\n And I was falling behind from my classes.\n\n1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.640\n I was not learning much physics\n\n1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:37.000\n and I was not making it rigorous.\n\n1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:40.600\n And to me, it was this dichotomy between math and physics.\n\n1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:41.440\n What am I doing?\n\n1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:43.960\n I like math but this is not exactly this.\n\n1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.480\n There comes Edward Witten as my advisor\n\n1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:52.040\n and I see him in action thinking about math and physics.\n\n1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.640\n He was amazing in math.\n\n1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:54.880\n He knew all about the math.\n\n1:36:54.880 --> 1:36:56.240\n It was no problem with him.\n\n1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:58.560\n But he thought about physics in a way\n\n1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:02.600\n which did not find this tension between the two.\n\n1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:04.040\n It was much more harmonious.\n\n1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:06.480\n For him, he would draw the Feynman diagrams\n\n1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:08.880\n but he wouldn't view it as a formalism.\n\n1:37:08.880 --> 1:37:10.560\n He was viewed, oh yeah, the particle goes over there\n\n1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:11.480\n and this is what's going on.\n\n1:37:11.480 --> 1:37:13.240\n And so wait, you're thinking really,\n\n1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.760\n is this particle, this is really electron going there?\n\n1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:16.600\n Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:18.880\n It's not the form or the result perturbation.\n\n1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:19.920\n No, no, no.\n\n1:37:19.920 --> 1:37:21.160\n You just feel like the electron.\n\n1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:23.040\n You're moving with this guy and do that and so on.\n\n1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:24.880\n And you're thinking invariantly about physics\n\n1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:27.760\n or the way he thought about relativity.\n\n1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:29.840\n Like I was thinking about this momentum system.\n\n1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:31.480\n He was thinking invariantly about physics,\n\n1:37:31.480 --> 1:37:34.000\n just like the way you think about invariant concepts\n\n1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.520\n and relativity, which don't depend on the frame of reference.\n\n1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:39.840\n He was thinking about the physics in invariant ways,\n\n1:37:39.840 --> 1:37:42.920\n the way that doesn't, that gives you a bigger perspective.\n\n1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:46.480\n So this gradually helped me appreciate\n\n1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:50.200\n that interconnections between ideas and physics\n\n1:37:50.200 --> 1:37:52.760\n replaces mathematical rigor.\n\n1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:56.360\n That the different facets reinforce each other.\n\n1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:58.560\n They say, oh, I cannot rigorously define\n\n1:37:58.560 --> 1:37:59.400\n what I mean by this,\n\n1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:01.640\n but this thing connects with this other physics I've seen\n\n1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:02.960\n and this other thing.\n\n1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:06.360\n And they together form an elegant story.\n\n1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:09.760\n And that replaced for me what I believed as a solidness,\n\n1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:13.000\n which I found in math as a rigor, solid.\n\n1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.160\n I found that replaced the rigor and solidness in physics.\n\n1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:19.200\n So I found, okay, that's the way you can hang onto.\n\n1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:20.320\n It is not wishy washy.\n\n1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:23.200\n It's not like somebody is just not being able to prove it,\n\n1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:24.720\n just making up a story.\n\n1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:25.960\n It was more than that.\n\n1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:28.480\n And it was no tension with mathematics.\n\n1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:31.720\n In fact, mathematics was helping it, like friends.\n\n1:38:31.720 --> 1:38:34.800\n And so much more harmonious and gives insights to physics.\n\n1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:36.600\n So that's, I think, one of the main things I learned\n\n1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:38.640\n from interactions with Witten.\n\n1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:42.120\n And I think that now perhaps I have taken that\n\n1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:43.440\n to a far extreme.\n\n1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:45.080\n Maybe he wouldn't go this far as I have.\n\n1:38:45.080 --> 1:38:48.560\n Namely, I use physics to define new mathematics\n\n1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:50.920\n in a way which would be far less rigorous\n\n1:38:50.920 --> 1:38:53.360\n than a physicist might necessarily believe,\n\n1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:55.680\n because I take the physical intuition,\n\n1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.880\n perhaps literally in many ways that could teach us about.\n\n1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:01.120\n So now I've gained so much confidence\n\n1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.680\n in physical intuition that I make bold statements\n\n1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:08.400\n that sometimes takes math friends off guard.\n\n1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:10.840\n So an example of it is mirror symmetry.\n\n1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:14.360\n So we were studying these compactification\n\n1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:15.760\n of string geometries.\n\n1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:17.040\n This is after my PhD now.\n\n1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:19.520\n I've, by the time I come to Harvard,\n\n1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:21.640\n we're studying these aspects of string compactification\n\n1:39:21.640 --> 1:39:23.440\n on these complicated manifolds,\n\n1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.320\n six dimensional spaces called Kalabial manifolds,\n\n1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:28.040\n very complicated.\n\n1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:31.120\n And I noticed with a couple other colleagues\n\n1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.200\n that there was a symmetry in physics suggested\n\n1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:36.600\n between different Kalabials.\n\n1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:40.360\n It suggested that you couldn't actually compute\n\n1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:42.560\n the Euler characteristic of a Kalabia.\n\n1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:45.520\n Euler characteristic is counting the number of points\n\n1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:48.400\n minus the number of edges plus the number of faces minus.\n\n1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:50.480\n So you can count the alternating sequence\n\n1:39:50.480 --> 1:39:51.800\n of properties of a space,\n\n1:39:51.800 --> 1:39:54.680\n which is a topological property of a space.\n\n1:39:54.680 --> 1:39:56.680\n So Euler characteristics of the Kalabia\n\n1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:57.880\n was a property of the space.\n\n1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.560\n And so we noticed that from the physics formalism,\n\n1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:03.520\n if string moves in a Kalabia,\n\n1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:05.480\n you cannot distinguish,\n\n1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:07.360\n we cannot compute the Euler characteristic.\n\n1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:10.280\n You can only compute the absolute value of it.\n\n1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:11.280\n Now this bothered us\n\n1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:14.360\n because how could you not compute the actual sign\n\n1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:17.440\n unless the both sides were the same?\n\n1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:21.120\n So I conjectured maybe for every Kalabia\n\n1:40:21.120 --> 1:40:22.320\n with Euler characteristics positive,\n\n1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:23.600\n there's one with negative.\n\n1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.240\n I told this to my colleague Yao\n\n1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:28.480\n who's namesake is Kalabia,\n\n1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:31.880\n that I'm making this conjecture.\n\n1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:33.600\n Is it possible that for every Kalabia,\n\n1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:36.560\n there's one with the opposite Euler characteristic?\n\n1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:37.840\n Sounds not reasonable.\n\n1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:38.680\n I said, why?\n\n1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:40.320\n He said, well, we know more Kalabias\n\n1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:42.720\n with negative Euler characteristics than positive.\n\n1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:46.520\n I said, but physics says we cannot distinguish them.\n\n1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:47.840\n At least I don't see how.\n\n1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:50.440\n So we conjectured that for every Kalabia\n\n1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:51.720\n with one sign, there's the other one,\n\n1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:54.080\n despite the mathematical evidence,\n\n1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.680\n despite the mathematical evidence,\n\n1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:58.480\n despite the expert telling us it's not the right idea.\n\n1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.040\n If a few years later, this symmetry, mirror symmetry\n\n1:41:02.040 --> 1:41:04.520\n between the sign with the opposite sign\n\n1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:06.960\n was later confirmed by mathematicians.\n\n1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:09.160\n So this is actually the opposite view.\n\n1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.560\n That is physics is so sure about it\n\n1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.720\n that you're going against the mathematical wisdom,\n\n1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:15.400\n telling them they better look for it.\n\n1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:19.360\n So taking the physical intuition literally\n\n1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:22.120\n and then having that drive the mathematics.\n\n1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:22.960\n Exactly.\n\n1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:26.160\n And now we are so confident about many such examples\n\n1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:30.320\n that has affected modern mathematics in ways like this,\n\n1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:31.600\n that we are much more confident\n\n1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:33.920\n about our understanding of what string theory is.\n\n1:41:33.920 --> 1:41:35.080\n These are another aspects,\n\n1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.600\n other aspects of why we feel string theory is correct.\n\n1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:39.880\n It's doing these kinds of things.\n\n1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:41.640\n I've been hearing your talk quite a bit\n\n1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:46.000\n about string theory, landscape and the swamp land.\n\n1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:47.840\n What the heck are those two concepts?\n\n1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:48.840\n Okay, very good question.\n\n1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:51.920\n So let's go back to what I was describing about Feynman.\n\n1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:55.800\n Feynman was trying to do these diagrams for graviton\n\n1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:57.320\n and electrons and all that.\n\n1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:00.120\n He found that he's getting infinities he cannot resolve.\n\n1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:04.080\n Okay, the natural conclusion is that field theories\n\n1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:06.600\n and gravity and quantum theory don't go together\n\n1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:07.760\n and you cannot have it.\n\n1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:11.320\n So in other words, field theories and gravity\n\n1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:14.240\n are inconsistent with quantum mechanics, period.\n\n1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:18.400\n String theory came up with examples\n\n1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:20.800\n but didn't address the question more broadly\n\n1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:23.120\n that is it true that every field theory\n\n1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:25.880\n can be coupled to gravity in a quantum mechanical way?\n\n1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:30.640\n It turns out that Feynman was essentially right.\n\n1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:33.200\n Almost all particle physics theories,\n\n1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:35.520\n no matter what you add to it,\n\n1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:38.320\n when you put gravity in it, doesn't work.\n\n1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:40.440\n Only rare exceptions work.\n\n1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:44.160\n So string theory are those rare exceptions.\n\n1:42:44.160 --> 1:42:46.040\n So therefore the general principle\n\n1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:47.800\n that Feynman found was correct.\n\n1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:50.320\n Quantum field theory and gravity and quantum mechanics\n\n1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:54.760\n don't go together except for Joule's exceptional cases.\n\n1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:56.400\n There are exceptional cases.\n\n1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:00.200\n Okay, the total vastness of quantum field theories\n\n1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.320\n that are there we call the set of quantum field theories,\n\n1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:05.320\n possible things.\n\n1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:08.300\n Which ones can be consistently coupled to gravity?\n\n1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:13.160\n We call that subspace the landscape.\n\n1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:16.200\n The rest of them we call the swampland.\n\n1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:18.040\n It doesn't mean they are bad quantum field theories,\n\n1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:19.960\n they are perfectly fine.\n\n1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:21.880\n But when you couple them to gravity,\n\n1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:24.200\n they don't make sense, unfortunately.\n\n1:43:24.200 --> 1:43:27.160\n And it turns out that the ratio of them,\n\n1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:29.720\n the number of theories which are consistent with gravity\n\n1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:31.320\n to the ones without,\n\n1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:33.960\n the ratio of the area of the landscape\n\n1:43:33.960 --> 1:43:36.800\n to the swampland, in other words, is measure zero.\n\n1:43:37.880 --> 1:43:40.240\n So the swampland's infinitely large?\n\n1:43:40.240 --> 1:43:41.640\n The swampland's infinitely large.\n\n1:43:41.640 --> 1:43:43.200\n So let me give you one example.\n\n1:43:43.200 --> 1:43:46.480\n Take a theory in four dimension with matter\n\n1:43:46.480 --> 1:43:48.880\n with maximum amount of supersymmetry.\n\n1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:51.680\n Can you get, it turns out a theory in four dimension\n\n1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:53.800\n with maximum amount of supersymmetry\n\n1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:56.660\n is characterized just with one thing, a group.\n\n1:43:56.660 --> 1:43:58.360\n What we call the gauge group.\n\n1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:01.500\n Once you pick a group, you have to find the theory.\n\n1:44:01.500 --> 1:44:04.120\n Okay, so does every group make sense?\n\n1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:05.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:07.460\n As far as quantum field theory, every group makes sense.\n\n1:44:07.460 --> 1:44:08.560\n There are infinitely many groups,\n\n1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:10.680\n there are infinitely many quantum field theories.\n\n1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:13.760\n But it turns out there are only finite number of them\n\n1:44:13.760 --> 1:44:16.840\n which are consistent with gravity out of that same list.\n\n1:44:16.840 --> 1:44:19.420\n So you can take any group but only finite number of them,\n\n1:44:19.420 --> 1:44:22.680\n the ones who's, what we call the rank of the group,\n\n1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:26.200\n the ones whose rank is less than 23.\n\n1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:29.720\n Any one bigger than rank 23 belongs to the swampland.\n\n1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:31.200\n There are infinitely many of them.\n\n1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:33.100\n They're beautiful field theories,\n\n1:44:33.100 --> 1:44:35.600\n but not when you include gravity.\n\n1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.760\n So then this becomes a hopeful thing.\n\n1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:41.920\n So in other words, in our universe, we have gravity.\n\n1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:44.660\n Therefore, we are part of that jewel subset.\n\n1:44:44.660 --> 1:44:49.480\n Now, is this jewel subset small or large?\n\n1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:50.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:54.480\n It turns out that subset is humongous,\n\n1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:56.260\n but we believe still finite.\n\n1:44:57.400 --> 1:44:59.400\n The set of possibilities is infinite,\n\n1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:02.280\n but the set of consistent ones,\n\n1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.280\n I mean, the set of quantum field theories are infinite,\n\n1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:07.140\n but the consistent ones are finite, but humongous.\n\n1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.080\n The fact that they're humongous\n\n1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:12.280\n is the problem we are facing in string theory,\n\n1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:16.560\n because we do not know which one of these possibilities\n\n1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:18.160\n the universe we live in.\n\n1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:20.380\n If we knew, we could make more specific predictions\n\n1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:21.400\n about our universe.\n\n1:45:21.400 --> 1:45:22.360\n We don't know.\n\n1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:24.520\n And that is one of the challenges when string theory,\n\n1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:26.040\n which point on the landscape,\n\n1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:28.660\n which corner of this landscape do we live in?\n\n1:45:28.660 --> 1:45:30.120\n We don't know.\n\n1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:31.780\n So what do we do?\n\n1:45:31.780 --> 1:45:35.680\n Well, there are principles that are beginning to emerge.\n\n1:45:35.680 --> 1:45:38.040\n So I will give you one example of it.\n\n1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:40.720\n You look at the patterns of what you're getting\n\n1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:41.940\n in terms of these good ones,\n\n1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:43.400\n the ones which are in the landscape\n\n1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:45.540\n compared to the ones which are not.\n\n1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:46.620\n You find certain patterns.\n\n1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:47.920\n I'll give you one pattern.\n\n1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:52.700\n You find in all the ones that you get from string theory,\n\n1:45:52.700 --> 1:45:55.560\n gravitational force is always there,\n\n1:45:55.560 --> 1:45:58.620\n but it's always, always the weakest force.\n\n1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:03.800\n However, you could easily imagine field theories\n\n1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.720\n for which gravity is not the weakest force.\n\n1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:08.960\n For example, take our universe.\n\n1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:10.680\n If you take mass of the electron,\n\n1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:14.080\n if you increase the mass of electron by a huge factor,\n\n1:46:14.080 --> 1:46:16.060\n the gravitational attraction of the electrons\n\n1:46:16.060 --> 1:46:17.840\n will be bigger than the electric repulsion\n\n1:46:17.840 --> 1:46:19.440\n between two electrons.\n\n1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:20.920\n And the gravity will be stronger.\n\n1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:21.740\n That's all.\n\n1:46:22.780 --> 1:46:25.060\n It happens that it's not the case in our universe\n\n1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:28.620\n because electron is very tiny in mass compared to that.\n\n1:46:28.620 --> 1:46:31.920\n Just like our universe, gravity is the weakest force.\n\n1:46:31.920 --> 1:46:33.840\n We find in all these other ones,\n\n1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:36.180\n which are part of the good ones,\n\n1:46:36.180 --> 1:46:37.960\n the gravity is the weakest force.\n\n1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:40.720\n This is called the weak gravity conjecture.\n\n1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:43.660\n We conjecture that all the points in the landscape\n\n1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:44.760\n have this property.\n\n1:46:45.920 --> 1:46:47.680\n Our universe being just an example of it.\n\n1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:49.520\n So there are these qualitative features\n\n1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:50.920\n that we are beginning to see.\n\n1:46:50.920 --> 1:46:52.320\n But how do we argue for this?\n\n1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:53.960\n Just by looking patterns?\n\n1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.760\n Just by looking string theory as this?\n\n1:46:55.760 --> 1:46:56.960\n No, that's not enough.\n\n1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:00.320\n We need more reason, more better reasoning.\n\n1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:01.840\n And it turns out there is.\n\n1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:05.040\n The reasoning for this turns out to be studying black holes.\n\n1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:09.500\n Ideas of black holes turn out to put certain restrictions\n\n1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:12.040\n of what a good quantum filter should be.\n\n1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:14.480\n It turns out using black hole,\n\n1:47:14.480 --> 1:47:16.620\n the fact that the black holes evaporate,\n\n1:47:17.700 --> 1:47:20.120\n the fact that the black holes evaporate\n\n1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:23.560\n gives you a way to check the relation\n\n1:47:23.560 --> 1:47:25.880\n between the mass and the charge of elementary particle.\n\n1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:28.480\n Because what you can do, you can take a charged particle\n\n1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:30.520\n and throw it into a charged black hole\n\n1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:32.040\n and wait it to evaporate.\n\n1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:34.440\n And by looking at the properties of evaporation,\n\n1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:37.800\n you find that if it cannot evaporate particles\n\n1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:39.500\n whose mass is less than their charge,\n\n1:47:39.500 --> 1:47:40.800\n then it will never evaporate.\n\n1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:42.120\n You will be stuck.\n\n1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:44.520\n And so the possibility of a black hole evaporation\n\n1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:47.180\n forces you to have particles whose mass\n\n1:47:47.180 --> 1:47:50.480\n is sufficiently small so that the gravity is weaker.\n\n1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.920\n So you connect this fact to the other fact.\n\n1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:55.040\n So we begin to find different facts\n\n1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:56.320\n that reinforce each other.\n\n1:47:56.320 --> 1:47:59.360\n So different parts of the physics reinforce each other.\n\n1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:02.360\n And once they all kind of come together,\n\n1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:04.240\n you believe that you're getting the principle correct.\n\n1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:05.560\n So weak gravity conjecture\n\n1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:07.480\n is one of the principles we believe in\n\n1:48:07.480 --> 1:48:09.760\n as a necessity of these conditions.\n\n1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:12.280\n So these are the predictions string theory are making.\n\n1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:13.120\n Is that enough?\n\n1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:14.680\n Well, it's qualitative.\n\n1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:16.200\n It's a semi quantity.\n\n1:48:16.200 --> 1:48:17.600\n It's just the mass of the electron\n\n1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:19.560\n should be less than some number.\n\n1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:23.040\n But that number is, if I call that number one,\n\n1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:23.880\n the mass of the electron\n\n1:48:23.880 --> 1:48:25.640\n turns out to be 10 to the minus 20 actually.\n\n1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:26.800\n So it's much less than one.\n\n1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:28.000\n It's not one.\n\n1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.240\n But on the other hand,\n\n1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.760\n there's a similar reasoning for a big black hole\n\n1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:34.020\n in our universe.\n\n1:48:34.020 --> 1:48:36.460\n And if that evaporation should take place,\n\n1:48:36.460 --> 1:48:37.520\n gives you another restriction,\n\n1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:39.300\n tells you the mass of the electron\n\n1:48:39.300 --> 1:48:41.320\n is bigger than 10 to the,\n\n1:48:41.320 --> 1:48:43.240\n now in this case, bigger than something.\n\n1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.760\n It shows bigger than 10 to the minus 30 in the Planck unit.\n\n1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:47.420\n So you find, huh,\n\n1:48:47.420 --> 1:48:49.400\n the mass of the electron should be less than one,\n\n1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:51.320\n but bigger than 10 to the minus 30.\n\n1:48:51.320 --> 1:48:52.160\n In our universe,\n\n1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:54.440\n the mass of the electron is 10 to the minus 20.\n\n1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:57.040\n Okay, now this kind of you could call postiction,\n\n1:48:57.040 --> 1:48:59.140\n but I would say it follows from principles\n\n1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:01.920\n that we now understand from string theory, first principle.\n\n1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:04.400\n So we are making, beginning to make\n\n1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:05.840\n these kinds of predictions,\n\n1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:09.900\n which are very much connected to aspects of particle physics\n\n1:49:09.900 --> 1:49:12.260\n that we didn't think are related to gravity.\n\n1:49:12.260 --> 1:49:14.960\n We thought, just take any electron mass you want.\n\n1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:15.800\n What's the problem?\n\n1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:17.380\n It has a problem with gravity.\n\n1:49:17.380 --> 1:49:18.880\n And so that conjecture\n\n1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:22.480\n has also a happy consequence\n\n1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:24.700\n that it explains that our universe,\n\n1:49:24.700 --> 1:49:28.640\n like why the heck is gravity so weak as a force\n\n1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:32.360\n and that's not only an accident, but almost a necessity\n\n1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:35.360\n if these forces are to coexist effectively?\n\n1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:38.280\n Exactly, so that's the reinforcement\n\n1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:40.760\n of what we know in our universe,\n\n1:49:40.760 --> 1:49:43.300\n but we are finding that as a general principle.\n\n1:49:43.300 --> 1:49:46.400\n So we want to know what aspects of our universe\n\n1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:47.920\n is forced on us,\n\n1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:50.740\n like the weak gravity conjecture and other aspects.\n\n1:49:50.740 --> 1:49:52.760\n How much of them do we understand?\n\n1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:54.800\n Can we have particles lighter than neutrinos?\n\n1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.380\n Or maybe that's not possible.\n\n1:49:56.380 --> 1:49:57.440\n You see the neutrino mass,\n\n1:49:57.440 --> 1:49:59.600\n it turns out to be related to dark energy\n\n1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:01.640\n in a mysterious way.\n\n1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:04.400\n Naively, there's no relation between dark energy\n\n1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:06.520\n and the mass of a particle.\n\n1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:07.560\n We have found arguments\n\n1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.040\n from within the swampland kind of ideas,\n\n1:50:10.040 --> 1:50:12.640\n why it has to be related.\n\n1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:15.280\n And so there are beginning to be these connections\n\n1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:17.920\n between graph consistency of quantum gravity\n\n1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:22.300\n and aspects of our universe gradually being sharpened.\n\n1:50:22.300 --> 1:50:25.200\n But we are still far from a precise quantitative prediction\n\n1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:27.880\n like we have to have such and such, but that's the hope,\n\n1:50:27.880 --> 1:50:29.520\n that we are going in that direction.\n\n1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:31.000\n Coming up with the theory of everything\n\n1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.200\n that unifies general relativity and quantum field theory\n\n1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:39.200\n is one of the big dreams of human civilization.\n\n1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:43.400\n Us descendants of apes wondering about how this world works.\n\n1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:44.840\n So a lot of people dream.\n\n1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:50.920\n What are your thoughts about sort of other out there ideas,\n\n1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:55.920\n theories of everything or unifying theories?\n\n1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.440\n So there's a quantum loop gravity.\n\n1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:03.160\n There's also more sort of like a friend of mine,\n\n1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:05.600\n Eric Weinstein beginning to propose\n\n1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:07.600\n something called geometric unity.\n\n1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:09.080\n So these kinds of attempts,\n\n1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:10.800\n whether it's through mathematical physics\n\n1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:12.520\n or through other avenues,\n\n1:51:12.520 --> 1:51:13.800\n or with Stephen Wolfram,\n\n1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:16.160\n a more computational view of the universe.\n\n1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:18.820\n Again, in his case, it's these hyper graphs\n\n1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:21.520\n that are very tiny objects as well.\n\n1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:23.680\n Similarly, a string theory\n\n1:51:23.680 --> 1:51:25.800\n and trying to grapple with this world.\n\n1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:26.880\n What do you think?\n\n1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:30.200\n Is there any of these theories that are compelling to you,\n\n1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:33.520\n that are interesting that may turn out to be true\n\n1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:36.240\n or at least may turn out to contain ideas that are useful?\n\n1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:37.320\n Yes, I think the latter.\n\n1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:40.760\n I would say that the containing ideas that are true\n\n1:51:40.760 --> 1:51:43.600\n is my opinion was what some of these ideas might be.\n\n1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:45.720\n For example, loop quantum gravity\n\n1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:47.920\n is to me not a complete theory of gravity in any sense,\n\n1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:50.320\n but they have some nuggets of truth in them.\n\n1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:53.000\n And typically what I expect to happen,\n\n1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.720\n and I have seen examples of this within string theory,\n\n1:51:55.720 --> 1:51:57.960\n aspects which we didn't think are part of string theory\n\n1:51:57.960 --> 1:51:58.840\n come to be part of it.\n\n1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:00.840\n For example, I'll give you one example.\n\n1:52:00.840 --> 1:52:03.320\n String was believed to be 10 dimensional.\n\n1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:05.960\n And then there was this 11 dimensional super gravity.\n\n1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:08.120\n Nobody know what the heck is that?\n\n1:52:08.120 --> 1:52:10.040\n Why are we getting 11 dimensional super gravity\n\n1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:11.720\n whereas string is saying it should be 10 dimensional?\n\n1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:14.880\n 11 was the maximum dimension you can have a super gravity,\n\n1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:17.980\n but string was saying, sorry, we're 10 dimensional.\n\n1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:20.520\n So for a while we thought that theory is wrong\n\n1:52:20.520 --> 1:52:21.420\n because how could it be?\n\n1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:23.380\n Because string theory is definitely a theory of everything.\n\n1:52:23.380 --> 1:52:25.440\n We later learned that one of the circles\n\n1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.520\n of string theory itself was tiny,\n\n1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:30.200\n that we had not appreciated that fact.\n\n1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:32.200\n And we discovered by doing thought experiments\n\n1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:35.000\n of string theory that there's gotta be an extra circle\n\n1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.420\n and that circle is connected\n\n1:52:36.420 --> 1:52:38.360\n to an 11 dimensional perspective.\n\n1:52:38.360 --> 1:52:40.720\n And that's what later on got called M theory.\n\n1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:43.240\n So there are these kinds of things\n\n1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:45.880\n that we do not know what exactly string theory is.\n\n1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:47.380\n We're still learning.\n\n1:52:47.380 --> 1:52:50.520\n So we do not have a final formulation of string theory.\n\n1:52:50.520 --> 1:52:52.380\n It's very well could be the different facets\n\n1:52:52.380 --> 1:52:53.940\n of different ideas come together\n\n1:52:53.940 --> 1:52:55.320\n like loop quantum gravity or whatnot,\n\n1:52:55.320 --> 1:52:56.840\n but I wouldn't put them on par.\n\n1:52:56.840 --> 1:53:01.080\n Namely, loop quantum gravity is a scatter of ideas\n\n1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:03.800\n about what happens to space when they get very tiny.\n\n1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:06.480\n For example, you replace things by discrete data\n\n1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:08.720\n and try to quantize it and so on.\n\n1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:13.560\n And it sounds like a natural idea to quantize space.\n\n1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:15.200\n If you were naively trying to do quantum space,\n\n1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:17.280\n you might think about trying to take points\n\n1:53:17.280 --> 1:53:20.160\n and put them together in some discrete fashion\n\n1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:23.000\n in some way that is reminiscent of loop quantum gravity.\n\n1:53:24.760 --> 1:53:27.000\n String theory is more subtle than that.\n\n1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.140\n For example, I will just give you an example.\n\n1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:31.200\n And this is the kind of thing that we didn't put in by hand,\n\n1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:32.440\n we got it out.\n\n1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:33.840\n And so it's more subtle than,\n\n1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:35.840\n so what happens if you squeeze the space\n\n1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:37.780\n to be smaller and smaller?\n\n1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:41.040\n Well, you think that after a certain distance,\n\n1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:43.800\n the notion of distance should break down.\n\n1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:47.680\n You know, when you go smaller than Planck scale,\n\n1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:48.700\n should break down.\n\n1:53:48.700 --> 1:53:50.640\n What happens in string theory?\n\n1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:52.160\n We do not know the full answer to that,\n\n1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:53.120\n but we know the following.\n\n1:53:53.120 --> 1:53:55.120\n Namely, if you take a space\n\n1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:56.560\n and bring it smaller and smaller,\n\n1:53:56.560 --> 1:53:58.560\n if the box gets smaller than the Planck scale\n\n1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:00.500\n by a factor of 10,\n\n1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:04.000\n it is equivalent by the duality transformation\n\n1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:05.760\n to a space which is 10 times bigger.\n\n1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:10.080\n So there's a symmetry called T duality,\n\n1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:12.480\n which takes L to one over L.\n\n1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.420\n Well, L is measured in Planck units,\n\n1:54:14.420 --> 1:54:16.280\n or more precisely string units.\n\n1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:20.520\n This inversion is a very subtle effect.\n\n1:54:20.520 --> 1:54:21.680\n And I would not have been,\n\n1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:23.760\n or any physicist would not have been able to design a theory\n\n1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:25.060\n which has this property,\n\n1:54:25.060 --> 1:54:27.160\n that when you make the space smaller,\n\n1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:29.440\n it is as if you're making it bigger.\n\n1:54:29.440 --> 1:54:32.480\n That means there is no experiment you can do\n\n1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:34.860\n to distinguish the size of the space.\n\n1:54:34.860 --> 1:54:35.740\n This is remarkable.\n\n1:54:35.740 --> 1:54:37.800\n For example, Einstein would have said,\n\n1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:39.400\n of course I can't measure the size of the space.\n\n1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.240\n What do I do?\n\n1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:41.400\n Well, I take a flashlight,\n\n1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:43.020\n I send the light around,\n\n1:54:43.020 --> 1:54:44.340\n measure how long it takes for the light\n\n1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:45.320\n to go around the space,\n\n1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:47.040\n and bring back and find the radius\n\n1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:48.800\n or circumference of the universe.\n\n1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:49.700\n What's the problem?\n\n1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:52.120\n I said, well, suppose you do that,\n\n1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:52.960\n and you shrink it.\n\n1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.000\n He said, well, it gets smaller and smaller.\n\n1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:54.840\n So what?\n\n1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:56.840\n I said, well, it turns out in string theory,\n\n1:54:56.840 --> 1:54:59.320\n there are two different kinds of photons.\n\n1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:02.360\n One photon measures one over L,\n\n1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:03.560\n the other one measures L.\n\n1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:07.520\n And so this duality reformulates.\n\n1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:08.840\n And when the space gets smaller,\n\n1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:10.720\n it says, oh no, you better use the bigger perspective\n\n1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:13.020\n because the smaller one is harder to deal with.\n\n1:55:13.020 --> 1:55:13.860\n So you do this one.\n\n1:55:13.860 --> 1:55:16.160\n So these examples of loop quantum gravity\n\n1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.240\n have none of these features.\n\n1:55:17.240 --> 1:55:18.640\n These features that I'm telling you about,\n\n1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:20.200\n we have learned from string theory.\n\n1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:22.040\n But they nevertheless have some of these ideas\n\n1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:24.500\n like topological gravity aspects\n\n1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:28.040\n are emphasized in the context of loop quantum gravity\n\n1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:28.860\n in some form.\n\n1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:31.280\n And so these ideas might be there in some kernel,\n\n1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:32.400\n in some corners of string theory.\n\n1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:35.360\n In fact, I wrote a paper about topological string theory\n\n1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:38.240\n and some connections with potentially loop quantum gravity,\n\n1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:39.240\n which could be part of that.\n\n1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:41.640\n So there are little facets of connections.\n\n1:55:41.640 --> 1:55:43.840\n I wouldn't say they're complete,\n\n1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:46.120\n but I would say most probably what will happen\n\n1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:48.480\n to some of these ideas, the good ones at least,\n\n1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:50.720\n they will be absorbed to string theory,\n\n1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:51.840\n if they are correct.\n\n1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:54.360\n Let me ask a crazy out there question.\n\n1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:59.360\n Can physics help us understand life?\n\n1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:04.360\n So we spoke so confidently about the laws of physics\n\n1:56:06.180 --> 1:56:07.700\n being able to explain reality.\n\n1:56:07.700 --> 1:56:11.900\n But, and we even said words like theory of everything,\n\n1:56:11.900 --> 1:56:13.620\n implying that the word everything\n\n1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:15.820\n is actually describing everything.\n\n1:56:15.820 --> 1:56:20.540\n Is it possible that the four laws we've been talking about\n\n1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:22.080\n are actually missing,\n\n1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:24.840\n they are accurate in describing what they're describing,\n\n1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:26.260\n but they're missing the description\n\n1:56:26.260 --> 1:56:27.900\n of a lot of other things,\n\n1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:30.540\n like emergence of life\n\n1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:35.100\n and emergence of perhaps consciousness.\n\n1:56:35.100 --> 1:56:39.280\n So is there, do you ever think about this kind of stuff\n\n1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:44.280\n where we would need to understand extra physics\n\n1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:49.480\n to try to explain the emergence of these complex pockets\n\n1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:54.280\n of interesting weird stuff that we call life\n\n1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:58.140\n and consciousness in this big homogeneous universe\n\n1:56:58.140 --> 1:57:00.420\n that's mostly boring and nothing is happening yet?\n\n1:57:00.420 --> 1:57:03.580\n So first of all, we don't claim that string theory\n\n1:57:03.580 --> 1:57:05.780\n is the theory of everything in the sense that\n\n1:57:05.780 --> 1:57:07.700\n we know enough what this theory is.\n\n1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:09.260\n We don't know enough about string theory itself,\n\n1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:10.100\n we are learning it.\n\n1:57:10.100 --> 1:57:12.020\n So I wouldn't say, okay, give me whatever,\n\n1:57:12.020 --> 1:57:14.400\n I will tell you how it works, no.\n\n1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:16.500\n However, I would say by definition,\n\n1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:19.420\n by definition to me physics is checking all reality.\n\n1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:22.580\n Any form of reality, I call it physics,\n\n1:57:22.580 --> 1:57:23.420\n that's my definition.\n\n1:57:23.420 --> 1:57:25.580\n I mean, I may not know a lot of it,\n\n1:57:25.580 --> 1:57:27.860\n like maybe the origin of life and so on,\n\n1:57:27.860 --> 1:57:29.300\n maybe a piece of that,\n\n1:57:29.300 --> 1:57:30.940\n but I would call that as part of physics.\n\n1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:33.560\n To me, reality is what we're after.\n\n1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:35.720\n I don't claim I know everything about reality.\n\n1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:38.660\n I don't claim string theory necessarily has the tools\n\n1:57:38.660 --> 1:57:41.300\n right now to describe all the reality either,\n\n1:57:41.300 --> 1:57:42.380\n but we are learning what it is.\n\n1:57:42.380 --> 1:57:44.860\n So I would say that I would not put a border to say,\n\n1:57:44.860 --> 1:57:47.140\n no, from this point onwards, it's not my territory,\n\n1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:48.420\n it's somebody else's.\n\n1:57:48.420 --> 1:57:50.860\n But whether we need new ideas in string theory\n\n1:57:50.860 --> 1:57:53.980\n to describe other reality features, for sure I believe,\n\n1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:57.100\n as I mentioned, I don't believe any of the laws\n\n1:57:57.100 --> 1:57:58.140\n we know today is final.\n\n1:57:58.140 --> 1:58:00.860\n So therefore, yes, we will need new ideas.\n\n1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:03.540\n This is a very tricky thing for us to understand\n\n1:58:05.340 --> 1:58:08.100\n and be precise about.\n\n1:58:08.100 --> 1:58:12.780\n But just because you understand the physics\n\n1:58:12.780 --> 1:58:17.040\n doesn't necessarily mean that you understand\n\n1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:21.800\n the emergence of chemistry, biology, life,\n\n1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:23.840\n intelligence, consciousness.\n\n1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:27.780\n So those are built, it's like you might understand\n\n1:58:27.780 --> 1:58:32.780\n the way bricks work, but to understand what it means\n\n1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:37.620\n to have a happy family, you don't get from the bricks.\n\n1:58:37.620 --> 1:58:42.300\n So directly, in theory you could,\n\n1:58:42.300 --> 1:58:44.780\n if you ran the universe over again,\n\n1:58:44.780 --> 1:58:47.460\n but just understanding the rules of the universe\n\n1:58:47.460 --> 1:58:49.900\n doesn't necessarily give you a sense\n\n1:58:49.900 --> 1:58:52.260\n of the weird, beautiful things that emerge.\n\n1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:55.380\n Right, no, so let me describe what you just said.\n\n1:58:55.380 --> 1:58:56.220\n So there are two questions.\n\n1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.540\n One is whether or not the techniques I use\n\n1:58:58.540 --> 1:59:00.620\n in let's say quantum field theory and so on\n\n1:59:00.620 --> 1:59:02.420\n will describe how the society works.\n\n1:59:02.420 --> 1:59:03.260\n Yes.\n\n1:59:03.260 --> 1:59:06.500\n Okay, that's far different scales of questions\n\n1:59:06.500 --> 1:59:08.260\n that we're asking here.\n\n1:59:08.260 --> 1:59:10.540\n The question is, is there a change of,\n\n1:59:10.540 --> 1:59:12.940\n is there a new law which takes over\n\n1:59:12.940 --> 1:59:15.420\n that cannot be connected to the older laws\n\n1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:18.100\n that we know, or more fundamental laws that we know?\n\n1:59:18.100 --> 1:59:20.340\n Do you need new laws to describe it?\n\n1:59:20.340 --> 1:59:21.980\n I don't think that's necessarily the case\n\n1:59:21.980 --> 1:59:23.660\n in many of these phenomena like chemistry\n\n1:59:23.660 --> 1:59:25.240\n or so on you mentioned.\n\n1:59:25.240 --> 1:59:27.700\n So we do expect in principle chemistry\n\n1:59:27.700 --> 1:59:29.620\n can be described by quantum mechanics.\n\n1:59:29.620 --> 1:59:31.620\n We don't think there's gonna be a magical thing,\n\n1:59:31.620 --> 1:59:32.980\n but chemistry is complicated.\n\n1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:34.840\n Yeah, indeed, there are rules of chemistry\n\n1:59:34.840 --> 1:59:37.820\n that chemists have put down which has not been explained yet\n\n1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:39.460\n using quantum mechanics.\n\n1:59:39.460 --> 1:59:41.100\n Do I believe that they will be something\n\n1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:42.160\n described by quantum mechanics?\n\n1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:43.000\n Yes, I do.\n\n1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.940\n I don't think they are going to be sitting there\n\n1:59:44.940 --> 1:59:47.060\n in this just forever, but maybe it's too complicated\n\n1:59:47.060 --> 1:59:50.340\n and maybe we'll wait for very powerful quantum computers\n\n1:59:50.340 --> 1:59:51.620\n or whatnot to solve those problems.\n\n1:59:51.620 --> 1:59:52.620\n I don't know.\n\n1:59:52.620 --> 1:59:54.760\n But I don't think in that context\n\n1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:57.980\n we have new principles to be added to fix those.\n\n1:59:57.980 --> 2:00:01.780\n So I'm perfectly fine in the intermediate situation\n\n2:00:01.780 --> 2:00:04.860\n to have rules of thumb or principles that chemists have found\n\n2:00:04.860 --> 2:00:06.940\n which are working, which are not founded\n\n2:00:06.940 --> 2:00:10.420\n on the basis of quantum mechanical laws, which does the job.\n\n2:00:10.420 --> 2:00:13.320\n Similarly, as biologists do not found everything\n\n2:00:13.320 --> 2:00:15.460\n in terms of chemistry, but they think,\n\n2:00:15.460 --> 2:00:16.740\n there's no reason why chemistry cannot.\n\n2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:18.780\n They don't think necessarily they're doing something\n\n2:00:18.780 --> 2:00:20.980\n amazingly not possible with chemistry.\n\n2:00:20.980 --> 2:00:22.220\n Coming back to your question,\n\n2:00:22.220 --> 2:00:26.180\n does consciousness, for example, bring this new ingredient?\n\n2:00:26.180 --> 2:00:28.260\n If indeed it needs a new ingredient,\n\n2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:30.540\n I will call that new ingredient part of physical law.\n\n2:00:30.540 --> 2:00:31.700\n We have to understand it.\n\n2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:34.500\n To me that, so I wouldn't put a line to say,\n\n2:00:34.500 --> 2:00:37.380\n okay, from this point onwards, it's disconnected.\n\n2:00:37.380 --> 2:00:39.520\n It's fully disconnected from string theory or whatever.\n\n2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:41.100\n We have to do something else.\n\n2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:42.340\n It's not a line.\n\n2:00:42.340 --> 2:00:45.800\n What I'm referring to is can physics of a few centuries\n\n2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:48.220\n from now that doesn't understand consciousness\n\n2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:51.620\n be much bigger than the physics of today,\n\n2:00:51.620 --> 2:00:53.980\n where the textbook grows?\n\n2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:54.940\n It definitely will.\n\n2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:55.980\n I would say, it will grow.\n\n2:00:55.980 --> 2:00:58.820\n I don't know if it grows because of consciousness\n\n2:00:58.820 --> 2:01:01.220\n being part of it or we have different view of consciousness.\n\n2:01:01.220 --> 2:01:03.780\n I do not know where the consciousness will fit.\n\n2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:07.540\n It's gonna be hard for me to guess.\n\n2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:09.420\n I mean, I can make random guesses now\n\n2:01:09.420 --> 2:01:11.420\n which probably most likely is wrong,\n\n2:01:11.420 --> 2:01:14.740\n but let me just do just for the sake of discussion.\n\n2:01:14.740 --> 2:01:18.180\n I could say, brain could be their quantum computer,\n\n2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:19.020\n classical computer.\n\n2:01:19.020 --> 2:01:20.820\n Their arguments against this being a quantum thing,\n\n2:01:20.820 --> 2:01:22.980\n so it's probably classical, and if it's classical,\n\n2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.660\n it could be like what we are doing in machine learning,\n\n2:01:24.660 --> 2:01:26.220\n slightly more fancy and so on.\n\n2:01:26.220 --> 2:01:28.540\n Okay, people can go to this argument to no end\n\n2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:30.120\n and to some whether consciousness exists or not,\n\n2:01:30.120 --> 2:01:32.320\n or life, does it have any meaning?\n\n2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:34.780\n Or is there a phase transition where you can say,\n\n2:01:34.780 --> 2:01:36.700\n does electron have a life or not?\n\n2:01:36.700 --> 2:01:39.140\n At what level does a particle become life?\n\n2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:41.300\n Maybe there's no definite definition of life\n\n2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:43.860\n in that same way that, we cannot say electron,\n\n2:01:43.860 --> 2:01:48.860\n if you, I like this example quite a bit.\n\n2:01:48.860 --> 2:01:51.160\n We distinguish between liquid and a gas phase,\n\n2:01:51.160 --> 2:01:53.860\n like water is liquid or vapor is gas,\n\n2:01:53.860 --> 2:01:54.700\n and we say they're different.\n\n2:01:54.700 --> 2:01:55.740\n You can distinguish them.\n\n2:01:55.740 --> 2:01:57.340\n Actually, that's not true.\n\n2:01:57.340 --> 2:01:59.860\n It's not true because we know from physics\n\n2:01:59.860 --> 2:02:01.960\n that you can change temperatures and pressure\n\n2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:03.660\n to go from liquid to the gas\n\n2:02:03.660 --> 2:02:05.700\n without making any phase transition.\n\n2:02:05.700 --> 2:02:08.460\n So there is no point that you can say this was a liquid\n\n2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:10.180\n and this was a gas.\n\n2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:12.060\n You can continuously change the parameters\n\n2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:13.820\n to go from one to the other.\n\n2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:15.860\n So at the end, it's very different looking.\n\n2:02:15.860 --> 2:02:18.060\n Like, I know that water is different from vapor,\n\n2:02:18.060 --> 2:02:21.260\n but there's no precise point this happens.\n\n2:02:21.260 --> 2:02:24.020\n I feel many of these things that we think,\n\n2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:25.940\n like consciousness, clearly dead person\n\n2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:27.220\n is not conscious and the other one is.\n\n2:02:27.220 --> 2:02:30.480\n So there's a difference like water and vapor,\n\n2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:32.860\n but there's no point you could say that this is conscious.\n\n2:02:32.860 --> 2:02:34.180\n There's no sharp transition.\n\n2:02:34.180 --> 2:02:38.420\n So it could very well be that what we call heuristically\n\n2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:41.020\n in daily life, consciousness is similar,\n\n2:02:41.020 --> 2:02:43.140\n or life is similar to that.\n\n2:02:43.140 --> 2:02:44.500\n I don't know if it's like that or not.\n\n2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:46.540\n I'm just hypothesizing it's possible.\n\n2:02:46.540 --> 2:02:48.260\n Like there's no.\n\n2:02:48.260 --> 2:02:49.380\n There's no discrete phases.\n\n2:02:49.380 --> 2:02:51.060\n There's no discrete phase transition like that.\n\n2:02:51.060 --> 2:02:56.060\n Yeah, yeah, but there might be concepts of temperature\n\n2:02:56.580 --> 2:02:59.340\n and pressure that we need to understand\n\n2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:02.740\n to describe what the head consciousness in life is\n\n2:03:02.740 --> 2:03:04.900\n that we're totally missing.\n\n2:03:04.900 --> 2:03:07.420\n I think that's not a useless question.\n\n2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:08.780\n Even those questions,\n\n2:03:08.780 --> 2:03:11.740\n they is back to our original discussion of philosophy.\n\n2:03:11.740 --> 2:03:15.220\n I would say consciousness and free will, for example,\n\n2:03:15.220 --> 2:03:18.900\n are topics that are very much so\n\n2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:20.860\n in the realm of philosophy currently.\n\n2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:21.700\n Yes.\n\n2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:22.980\n But I don't think they will always be.\n\n2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:23.940\n I agree with you.\n\n2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:24.760\n I agree with you.\n\n2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:27.060\n And I think I'm fine with some topics\n\n2:03:27.060 --> 2:03:29.820\n being part of a different realm than physics today\n\n2:03:29.820 --> 2:03:32.180\n because we don't have the right tools,\n\n2:03:32.180 --> 2:03:33.360\n just like biology was.\n\n2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.620\n I mean, before we had DNA and all that genetics\n\n2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:37.660\n and all that gradually began to take hold.\n\n2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:42.100\n I mean, when people were beginning phase experiments\n\n2:03:42.100 --> 2:03:44.180\n with biology and chemistry and so on,\n\n2:03:44.180 --> 2:03:46.040\n gradually they came together.\n\n2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:47.300\n So it wasn't like together.\n\n2:03:47.300 --> 2:03:49.940\n So yeah, I'd be perfectly understanding of a situation\n\n2:03:49.940 --> 2:03:51.540\n where we don't have the tools.\n\n2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:53.340\n So do these experiments that you think\n\n2:03:53.340 --> 2:03:55.180\n as defines a conscious in different form\n\n2:03:55.180 --> 2:03:57.220\n and gradually we'll build it and connect it.\n\n2:03:57.220 --> 2:03:59.660\n And yes, we might discover new principles of nature\n\n2:03:59.660 --> 2:04:01.100\n that we didn't know.\n\n2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:03.420\n I don't know, but I would say that if they are,\n\n2:04:03.420 --> 2:04:04.700\n they will be deeply connected with the else.\n\n2:04:04.700 --> 2:04:06.980\n We have seen in physics,\n\n2:04:06.980 --> 2:04:08.300\n we don't have things in isolation.\n\n2:04:08.300 --> 2:04:10.820\n You cannot compartmentalize,\n\n2:04:10.820 --> 2:04:13.300\n this is gravity, this is electricity, this is that.\n\n2:04:13.300 --> 2:04:15.220\n We have learned they all talk to each other.\n\n2:04:15.220 --> 2:04:19.060\n There's no way to make them in one corner and don't talk.\n\n2:04:19.060 --> 2:04:21.300\n So the same thing with anything, anything which is real.\n\n2:04:21.300 --> 2:04:22.380\n So consciousness is real.\n\n2:04:22.380 --> 2:04:25.200\n So therefore we have to connect it to everything else.\n\n2:04:25.200 --> 2:04:26.640\n So to me, once you connect it,\n\n2:04:26.640 --> 2:04:27.860\n you cannot say it's not reality.\n\n2:04:27.860 --> 2:04:29.860\n And once it's reality, it's physics.\n\n2:04:29.860 --> 2:04:30.700\n I call it physics.\n\n2:04:30.700 --> 2:04:32.980\n It may not be the physics I know today, for sure it's not,\n\n2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:37.300\n but I would be surprised if there's disconnected realities\n\n2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:41.260\n that you cannot imagine them as part of the same soup.\n\n2:04:41.260 --> 2:04:45.180\n So I guess God doesn't have a biology or chemistry textbook\n\n2:04:45.180 --> 2:04:49.460\n and mostly, or maybe he or she reads it for fun,\n\n2:04:49.460 --> 2:04:50.500\n biology and chemistry,\n\n2:04:50.500 --> 2:04:52.100\n but when you're trying to get some work done,\n\n2:04:52.100 --> 2:04:54.500\n it'll be going to the physics textbook.\n\n2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:59.500\n Okay, what advice, let's put on your wise visionary hat.\n\n2:04:59.500 --> 2:05:03.860\n What advice do you have for young people today?\n\n2:05:03.860 --> 2:05:08.060\n You've dedicated your book actually to your kids,\n\n2:05:08.060 --> 2:05:09.620\n to your family.\n\n2:05:09.620 --> 2:05:11.500\n What advice would you give to them?\n\n2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:13.880\n What advice would you give to young people today\n\n2:05:13.880 --> 2:05:16.780\n thinking about their career, thinking about life,\n\n2:05:16.780 --> 2:05:19.820\n of how to live successful life, how to live a good life?\n\n2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:23.020\n Yes, yes, I have three sons.\n\n2:05:23.020 --> 2:05:26.900\n And in fact, to them, I have tried not to give\n\n2:05:26.900 --> 2:05:28.280\n too much advice.\n\n2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:31.420\n So even though I've tried to kind of not give advice,\n\n2:05:31.420 --> 2:05:33.920\n maybe indirectly it has been some impact.\n\n2:05:33.920 --> 2:05:36.020\n My oldest one is doing biophysics, for example,\n\n2:05:36.020 --> 2:05:38.320\n and the second one is doing machine learning\n\n2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:40.620\n and the third one is doing theoretical computer science.\n\n2:05:40.620 --> 2:05:42.500\n So there are these facets of interest\n\n2:05:42.500 --> 2:05:44.660\n which are not too far from my area,\n\n2:05:44.660 --> 2:05:47.980\n but I have not tried to impact them in that way,\n\n2:05:47.980 --> 2:05:49.980\n but they have followed their own interests.\n\n2:05:49.980 --> 2:05:51.860\n And I think that's the advice I would give\n\n2:05:51.860 --> 2:05:54.980\n to any young person, follow your own interests\n\n2:05:54.980 --> 2:05:58.580\n and let that take you wherever it takes you.\n\n2:05:58.580 --> 2:06:03.380\n And this I did in my own case that I was planning\n\n2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:06.220\n to study economics and electrical engineering\n\n2:06:06.220 --> 2:06:08.100\n when I started at MIT.\n\n2:06:08.100 --> 2:06:10.620\n And I discovered that I'm more passionate\n\n2:06:10.620 --> 2:06:11.700\n about math and physics.\n\n2:06:11.700 --> 2:06:14.020\n And at that time I didn't feel math and physics\n\n2:06:14.020 --> 2:06:15.860\n would make a good career.\n\n2:06:15.860 --> 2:06:18.540\n And so I was kind of hesitant to go in that direction,\n\n2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:20.560\n but I did because I kind of felt that\n\n2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:22.580\n that's what I'm driven to do.\n\n2:06:22.580 --> 2:06:26.260\n So I don't regret it, I'm lucky in the sense\n\n2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:28.340\n that society supports people like me\n\n2:06:28.340 --> 2:06:29.900\n who are doing these abstract stuff,\n\n2:06:29.900 --> 2:06:32.540\n which may or may not be experimentally verified\n\n2:06:32.540 --> 2:06:36.380\n even let alone applied to the technology in our lifetimes.\n\n2:06:36.380 --> 2:06:37.660\n I'm lucky I'm doing that.\n\n2:06:37.660 --> 2:06:41.300\n And I feel that if people follow their interests,\n\n2:06:41.300 --> 2:06:43.960\n they will find the niche that they're good at.\n\n2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:48.020\n And this coincidence of hopefully their interests\n\n2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:51.860\n and abilities are kind of aligned,\n\n2:06:51.860 --> 2:06:54.420\n at least some extent to be able to drive them\n\n2:06:54.420 --> 2:06:56.260\n to something which is successful.\n\n2:06:56.260 --> 2:06:58.540\n And not to be driven by things like,\n\n2:06:58.540 --> 2:07:00.020\n this doesn't make a good career,\n\n2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:02.400\n or this doesn't do that, and my parents expect that,\n\n2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:03.240\n or what about this?\n\n2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:06.140\n And I think ultimately you have to live with yourself\n\n2:07:06.140 --> 2:07:08.660\n and you only have one life and it's short, very short.\n\n2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:10.580\n I can tell you I'm getting there.\n\n2:07:10.580 --> 2:07:11.500\n So I know it's short.\n\n2:07:11.500 --> 2:07:14.980\n So you really want not to do things\n\n2:07:14.980 --> 2:07:15.900\n that you don't want to do.\n\n2:07:15.900 --> 2:07:17.340\n So I think following an interest\n\n2:07:17.340 --> 2:07:19.300\n is my strongest advice to young people.\n\n2:07:19.300 --> 2:07:22.180\n Yeah, it's scary when your interest\n\n2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:26.620\n doesn't directly map to a career of the past or of today.\n\n2:07:26.620 --> 2:07:28.700\n So you're almost anticipating future careers\n\n2:07:28.700 --> 2:07:29.640\n that could be created.\n\n2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:30.480\n It's scary.\n\n2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:34.180\n But yeah, there's something to that,\n\n2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:36.820\n especially when the interest and the ability align,\n\n2:07:36.820 --> 2:07:39.620\n that you will pave a path,\n\n2:07:39.620 --> 2:07:41.220\n that will find a way to make money,\n\n2:07:41.220 --> 2:07:42.660\n especially in this society,\n\n2:07:42.660 --> 2:07:46.220\n in a capitalistic United States society.\n\n2:07:46.220 --> 2:07:51.220\n It feels like ability and passion paves the way.\n\n2:07:52.260 --> 2:07:53.100\n Yes.\n\n2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:56.940\n At the very least, you can sell funny T shirts.\n\n2:07:56.940 --> 2:07:57.780\n Yes.\n\n2:07:57.780 --> 2:07:59.940\n You've mentioned life is short.\n\n2:08:00.820 --> 2:08:04.140\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n2:08:04.140 --> 2:08:05.900\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n2:08:05.900 --> 2:08:08.100\n I don't think about my mortality.\n\n2:08:09.540 --> 2:08:12.460\n I think that I don't think about my death.\n\n2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:14.700\n I don't think about death in general too much.\n\n2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:16.820\n First of all, it's something that I can't do much about,\n\n2:08:16.820 --> 2:08:18.180\n and I think it's something\n\n2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:21.640\n that it doesn't drive my everyday action.\n\n2:08:21.640 --> 2:08:23.300\n It is natural to expect\n\n2:08:23.300 --> 2:08:25.940\n that it's somewhat like the time reversal situation.\n\n2:08:25.940 --> 2:08:27.940\n So we believe that we have this approximate symmetry\n\n2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:29.440\n in nature, time reversal.\n\n2:08:29.440 --> 2:08:30.500\n Going forward, we die.\n\n2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:32.300\n Going backwards, we get born.\n\n2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:35.060\n So what was it to get born?\n\n2:08:35.060 --> 2:08:37.340\n It wasn't such a good or bad feeling.\n\n2:08:37.340 --> 2:08:38.780\n I have no feeling of it.\n\n2:08:38.780 --> 2:08:42.140\n So who knows what the death will feel like,\n\n2:08:42.140 --> 2:08:43.460\n the moment of death or whatnot.\n\n2:08:43.460 --> 2:08:44.660\n So I don't know.\n\n2:08:44.660 --> 2:08:45.500\n It is not known,\n\n2:08:45.500 --> 2:08:50.160\n but in what form do we exist before or after?\n\n2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:53.740\n Again, it's something that it's partly philosophical maybe.\n\n2:08:53.740 --> 2:08:55.900\n I like how you draw comfort from symmetry.\n\n2:08:55.900 --> 2:08:58.660\n It does seem that there is something asymmetric here,\n\n2:08:58.660 --> 2:08:59.700\n a breaking of symmetry,\n\n2:08:59.700 --> 2:09:04.700\n because there's something to the creative force\n\n2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:09.580\n of the human spirit that goes only one way.\n\n2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:10.400\n Right.\n\n2:09:10.400 --> 2:09:13.140\n That it seems the finiteness of life\n\n2:09:13.140 --> 2:09:15.940\n is the thing that drives the creativity.\n\n2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:20.940\n And so it does seem that at least the contemplation\n\n2:09:21.540 --> 2:09:24.580\n of the finiteness of life, of mortality,\n\n2:09:24.580 --> 2:09:27.100\n is the thing that helps you get your stuff together.\n\n2:09:27.100 --> 2:09:28.140\n Yes, I think that's true,\n\n2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:29.560\n but actually I have a different perspective\n\n2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:30.400\n on that a little bit.\n\n2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:31.240\n Yes.\n\n2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:34.820\n Namely, suppose I told you you're immortal.\n\n2:09:34.820 --> 2:09:35.660\n Yes.\n\n2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:39.780\n I think your life will be totally boring after that,\n\n2:09:39.780 --> 2:09:41.460\n because you will not,\n\n2:09:41.460 --> 2:09:45.960\n I think part of the reason we have enjoyment in life\n\n2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:47.280\n is the finiteness of it.\n\n2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:48.120\n Yes.\n\n2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:52.180\n And so I think mortality might be a blessing,\n\n2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:54.000\n and immortality may not.\n\n2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:55.960\n So I think that we value things\n\n2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:58.080\n because we have that finite life.\n\n2:09:58.080 --> 2:09:59.300\n We appreciate things.\n\n2:09:59.300 --> 2:10:00.140\n We want to do this.\n\n2:10:00.140 --> 2:10:00.960\n We want to do that.\n\n2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:01.800\n We have motivation.\n\n2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:03.080\n If I told you, you know, you have infinite life.\n\n2:10:03.080 --> 2:10:04.700\n Oh, I don't, I don't need to do this today.\n\n2:10:04.700 --> 2:10:08.520\n I have another billion or trillion or infinite life.\n\n2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:10.160\n So why do I do now?\n\n2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:11.840\n There is no motivation.\n\n2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:13.600\n A lot of the things that we do\n\n2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:16.960\n are driven by that finiteness of these resources.\n\n2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:20.100\n So I think it is a blessing in disguise.\n\n2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:23.380\n I don't regret it that we have more finite life.\n\n2:10:23.380 --> 2:10:28.380\n And I think that the process of being part of this thing,\n\n2:10:31.040 --> 2:10:33.080\n that, you know, the reality,\n\n2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:36.400\n to me, part of what attracts me to science\n\n2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:39.700\n is to connect to that immortality kind of,\n\n2:10:39.700 --> 2:10:43.940\n namely the laws, the reality beyond us.\n\n2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:47.900\n To me, I'm resigned to the fact that not only me,\n\n2:10:47.900 --> 2:10:49.780\n everybody's going to die.\n\n2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:51.940\n So this is a little bit of a consolation.\n\n2:10:51.940 --> 2:10:53.860\n None of us are going to be around.\n\n2:10:53.860 --> 2:10:55.220\n So therefore, okay,\n\n2:10:55.220 --> 2:10:57.380\n and none of the people before me are around.\n\n2:10:57.380 --> 2:10:58.620\n So therefore, yeah, okay,\n\n2:10:58.620 --> 2:10:59.940\n this is something everybody goes through.\n\n2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:03.420\n So taking that minuscule version of,\n\n2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:07.520\n okay, how tiny we are and how short time it is and so on,\n\n2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:10.140\n to connect to the deeper truth beyond us,\n\n2:11:10.140 --> 2:11:11.900\n the reality beyond us,\n\n2:11:11.900 --> 2:11:16.820\n is what sense of, quote unquote, immortality I would get.\n\n2:11:16.820 --> 2:11:18.780\n Namely, at least I can hang on\n\n2:11:18.780 --> 2:11:20.700\n to this little piece of truth,\n\n2:11:20.700 --> 2:11:23.180\n even though I know, I know it's not complete.\n\n2:11:23.180 --> 2:11:25.780\n I know it's going to be imperfect.\n\n2:11:25.780 --> 2:11:28.420\n I know it's going to change and it's going to be improved.\n\n2:11:28.420 --> 2:11:30.580\n But having a little bit deeper insight\n\n2:11:30.580 --> 2:11:32.700\n than just the naive thing around us,\n\n2:11:32.700 --> 2:11:35.240\n little earth here and little galaxy and so on,\n\n2:11:35.240 --> 2:11:40.140\n makes me feel a little bit more pleasure to live this life.\n\n2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:43.180\n So I think that's the way I view my role as a scientist.\n\n2:11:43.180 --> 2:11:48.180\n Yeah, the scarcity of this life helps us appreciate\n\n2:11:48.380 --> 2:11:50.180\n the beauty of the immortal,\n\n2:11:50.180 --> 2:11:53.700\n the universal truths of that physics present us.\n\n2:11:53.700 --> 2:11:58.700\n And maybe one day physics will have something to say\n\n2:11:58.900 --> 2:12:03.380\n about that beauty in itself,\n\n2:12:03.380 --> 2:12:06.540\n explaining why the heck it's so beautiful\n\n2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:08.280\n to appreciate the laws of physics,\n\n2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:13.280\n and yet why it's so tragic that we would die so quickly.\n\n2:12:14.660 --> 2:12:16.160\n Yes, we die so quickly.\n\n2:12:16.160 --> 2:12:18.100\n So that can be a bit longer, that's for sure.\n\n2:12:18.100 --> 2:12:19.220\n It would be very nice.\n\n2:12:19.220 --> 2:12:20.820\n Maybe physics will help out.\n\n2:12:20.820 --> 2:12:23.880\n Well, Kamran, it was an incredible conversation.\n\n2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:25.120\n Thank you so much once again\n\n2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.340\n for painting a beautiful picture of the history of physics.\n\n2:12:28.340 --> 2:12:32.420\n And it kind of presents a hopeful view\n\n2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:33.500\n of the future of physics.\n\n2:12:33.500 --> 2:12:35.780\n So I really, really appreciate that.\n\n2:12:35.780 --> 2:12:37.380\n It's a huge honor that you would talk to me\n\n2:12:37.380 --> 2:12:39.300\n and waste all your valuable time with me.\n\n2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:40.140\n I really appreciate it.\n\n2:12:40.140 --> 2:12:40.960\n Thanks, Lex.\n\n2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:42.740\n It was a pleasure, and I loved talking with you.\n\n2:12:42.740 --> 2:12:44.500\n And this is wonderful set of discussions.\n\n2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:46.460\n I really enjoyed my time with this discussion.\n\n2:12:46.460 --> 2:12:47.940\n Thank you.\n\n2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:49.420\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:12:49.420 --> 2:12:50.580\n with Kamran Vafa.\n\n2:12:50.580 --> 2:12:54.220\n And thank you to Headspace, Jordan Harmerjee Show,\n\n2:12:54.220 --> 2:12:56.620\n Squarespace, and Allform.\n\n2:12:56.620 --> 2:13:00.180\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:13:00.180 --> 2:13:02.620\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:13:02.620 --> 2:13:04.960\n from the great Richard Feynman.\n\n2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:07.660\n \"'Physics isn't the most important thing.\n\n2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:08.660\n \"'Love is.'\"\n\n2:13:08.660 --> 2:13:29.660\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
