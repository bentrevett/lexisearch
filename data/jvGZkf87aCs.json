00:12.120\n I never think final, I think soundscape\n\n00:12.120 --> 00:14.160\n of how I'm feeling right now.\n\n00:14.160 --> 00:15.760\n So it could be the middle of the song\n\n00:15.760 --> 00:18.240\n for all I know when I'm doing that.\n\n00:18.240 --> 00:22.640\n But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody\n\n00:22.640 --> 00:25.440\n and music really come at the same time.\n\n00:25.440 --> 00:30.440\n Like by same time, I mean, as I'm expressing maybe,\n\n00:32.920 --> 00:33.760\n I'm feeling like.\n\n00:33.760 --> 00:38.760\n Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.\n\n00:40.720 --> 00:42.280\n Like it's not that simple, but it's like,\n\n00:42.280 --> 00:45.480\n I'll hear it like, it's like, here's all the orchestra\n\n00:45.480 --> 00:47.480\n and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once.\n\n00:47.480 --> 00:51.700\n And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.\n\n00:51.700 --> 00:56.340\n The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds,\n\n00:56.340 --> 00:58.660\n the lead singer of Imagine Dragons,\n\n00:58.660 --> 01:00.920\n one of the most popular bands in the world\n\n01:00.920 --> 01:04.980\n with over 75 million records sold and with four songs\n\n01:04.980 --> 01:08.460\n being streamed over a billion times on Spotify.\n\n01:08.460 --> 01:11.520\n Given all that, Dan is one of the most down to earth,\n\n01:11.520 --> 01:14.260\n kind, thoughtful and fascinating human beings\n\n01:14.260 --> 01:17.020\n I've ever met, grounded in part\n\n01:17.020 --> 01:20.500\n by his lifelong struggle with mental health.\n\n01:20.500 --> 01:24.200\n The darkness, the love and the creative brilliance\n\n01:24.200 --> 01:26.900\n are all there in this one humble mind.\n\n01:26.900 --> 01:30.340\n For this reason and many others, we became fast friends.\n\n01:30.340 --> 01:33.740\n Plus, he recently started his journey in programming,\n\n01:33.740 --> 01:37.340\n which funny enough is where we start this wide ranging,\n\n01:37.340 --> 01:40.280\n deeply personal and fun conversation.\n\n01:40.280 --> 01:42.100\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:42.100 --> 01:44.260\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:44.260 --> 01:45.460\n in the description.\n\n01:45.460 --> 01:48.700\n And now, dear friends, here's Dan Reynolds.\n\n01:48.700 --> 01:51.060\n So, we were talking offline\n\n01:51.060 --> 01:53.300\n that you're not just getting into programming.\n\n01:53.300 --> 01:57.440\n What's the most beautiful program you've ever written?\n\n01:57.440 --> 01:58.940\n Something that brought you joy?\n\n02:01.100 --> 02:04.540\n There's something, I really love completion.\n\n02:04.540 --> 02:07.180\n It's the reason that I'm addicted to songwriting.\n\n02:07.180 --> 02:11.140\n I like there being nothing and then having some blocks\n\n02:11.140 --> 02:14.620\n or tools and building them into what you want it\n\n02:14.620 --> 02:18.540\n to look like and then I find it incredibly rewarding\n\n02:18.540 --> 02:23.260\n to stand back and look at what you did at the end.\n\n02:23.260 --> 02:24.140\n It could be anything.\n\n02:24.140 --> 02:27.500\n For me, it was as simple to begin with\n\n02:27.500 --> 02:30.860\n as just because it's object oriented,\n\n02:30.860 --> 02:33.940\n like making a cube move.\n\n02:33.940 --> 02:36.040\n As simple as that, understanding that\n\n02:36.040 --> 02:38.540\n and knowing that I built that and made it do that\n\n02:39.420 --> 02:43.020\n is really rewarding and I think it's the thing\n\n02:43.020 --> 02:46.580\n that drew me into wanting to learn more.\n\n02:46.580 --> 02:51.580\n But as far as what is some big piece of code\n\n02:52.020 --> 02:54.220\n that I've done, absolutely not.\n\n02:54.220 --> 02:55.540\n I'm still at a level where it's more like\n\n02:55.540 --> 02:59.580\n what is a tutorial that I followed and got,\n\n02:59.580 --> 03:03.700\n and then, yeah, so I couldn't say I'm at a level\n\n03:03.700 --> 03:06.060\n where I've done anything beautiful at all in code.\n\n03:06.060 --> 03:08.740\n But you're also interested in potentially,\n\n03:08.740 --> 03:11.240\n like your heart is drawn to creating games.\n\n03:12.300 --> 03:13.360\n Creating anything.\n\n03:14.260 --> 03:15.460\n And completing it.\n\n03:15.460 --> 03:16.300\n Yeah.\n\n03:16.300 --> 03:18.660\n To feel good as it's done.\n\n03:18.660 --> 03:21.860\n Yeah, I mean, I've been working over the last two years\n\n03:23.140 --> 03:27.020\n with actually a team out of Kiev on,\n\n03:27.020 --> 03:28.900\n and we can get into that, it's a whole other story,\n\n03:28.900 --> 03:30.620\n but on a computer game.\n\n03:30.620 --> 03:34.020\n And really, I've kept that kind of under wraps,\n\n03:34.020 --> 03:37.320\n but yeah, we're kind of getting to a point now\n\n03:37.320 --> 03:39.460\n where we have a prototype that we can play\n\n03:39.460 --> 03:42.380\n and it's a lot of fun and thankfully,\n\n03:42.380 --> 03:45.340\n all the team members are in safe places now.\n\n03:45.340 --> 03:47.020\n Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit,\n\n03:47.020 --> 03:50.500\n but when that started is when I really decided,\n\n03:50.500 --> 03:53.980\n okay, I need to understand base level coding in C Sharp,\n\n03:53.980 --> 03:56.780\n so I'm not an idiot talking to these people.\n\n03:56.780 --> 03:58.540\n And so it's, yeah, we've been doing that\n\n03:58.540 --> 03:59.380\n for a couple of years.\n\n03:59.380 --> 04:02.780\n Is there any parallels between the final completion\n\n04:02.780 --> 04:05.020\n that you feel with programming?\n\n04:05.020 --> 04:07.100\n Which I think is a little bit more definitive.\n\n04:07.100 --> 04:08.940\n Like there's debugging, the code doesn't work,\n\n04:08.940 --> 04:09.980\n it's messy and so on.\n\n04:09.980 --> 04:11.460\n There's the early design stages,\n\n04:11.460 --> 04:14.340\n you're not sure how to have functions and classes,\n\n04:14.340 --> 04:15.180\n how it's all gonna work.\n\n04:15.180 --> 04:17.820\n And then it comes together and it's really done\n\n04:17.820 --> 04:21.180\n because it works and there's a cube moving on the screen.\n\n04:21.180 --> 04:23.940\n Is there any parallels between that and music?\n\n04:23.940 --> 04:27.980\n Because are you really ever done done with a song?\n\n04:27.980 --> 04:30.940\n It's exactly the same thing for me,\n\n04:30.940 --> 04:33.460\n just in that it's art.\n\n04:33.460 --> 04:38.460\n I really believe that we have not fully encapsulated artists.\n\n04:39.660 --> 04:42.940\n Like when we say art, I think most people think,\n\n04:42.940 --> 04:46.700\n okay, the medium must be painting or drawing\n\n04:46.700 --> 04:50.300\n or music or writing.\n\n04:50.300 --> 04:53.580\n But I really believe anytime you're creating some things,\n\n04:53.580 --> 04:58.140\n engineers, for instance, you're creating something\n\n04:58.140 --> 05:01.820\n with tools that you have and it can be incredibly beautiful.\n\n05:03.340 --> 05:07.780\n And so yeah, I think, and it's never done.\n\n05:07.780 --> 05:09.700\n I feel like I look at songs that I've done\n\n05:09.700 --> 05:14.700\n and I never felt you have to let go or I have to let go.\n\n05:15.620 --> 05:16.460\n And that's all I've,\n\n05:16.460 --> 05:18.940\n I'm just continually making myself let go.\n\n05:18.940 --> 05:20.220\n But I look at songs that I've done\n\n05:20.220 --> 05:25.220\n and wish I had done more or kept going down that road\n\n05:25.500 --> 05:26.660\n and what would have happened.\n\n05:26.660 --> 05:30.500\n And I'm really contained to, because of what our band is\n\n05:30.500 --> 05:34.140\n and what our fans expect and there's so much more to it\n\n05:34.140 --> 05:38.300\n that it's like I'm fitting in a box always.\n\n05:38.300 --> 05:41.100\n And it's like, this song shouldn't be longer\n\n05:41.100 --> 05:42.500\n than three minutes and 30 seconds.\n\n05:42.500 --> 05:46.100\n And I don't know if I remember the chorus after I heard it.\n\n05:46.100 --> 05:47.980\n Maybe I need to hear the chorus three times\n\n05:47.980 --> 05:49.140\n instead of those two times.\n\n05:49.140 --> 05:52.820\n It's like, there's certain, especially in pop music,\n\n05:52.820 --> 05:54.680\n it's really hard to,\n\n05:59.660 --> 06:02.340\n yeah, it feels like there's confines,\n\n06:02.340 --> 06:03.940\n even though people are like, well, there's no confines,\n\n06:03.940 --> 06:05.620\n but still everybody's writing a pop song\n\n06:05.620 --> 06:06.940\n that's a few minutes.\n\n06:06.940 --> 06:08.740\n And are those explicit in your mind\n\n06:08.740 --> 06:12.820\n or are they just kinda, the gut is, like you said, chorus.\n\n06:12.820 --> 06:15.380\n Should you have chorus once, twice or three times?\n\n06:15.380 --> 06:17.500\n Is that a gut thing or is that a rule thing?\n\n06:17.500 --> 06:18.940\n You know, I think it's a rule.\n\n06:18.940 --> 06:20.900\n I mean, it's obviously a rule I impose on myself.\n\n06:20.900 --> 06:24.800\n Nobody's in my house saying, hey, Dan,\n\n06:24.800 --> 06:26.780\n if you don't do this, I'm gonna punish you.\n\n06:26.780 --> 06:29.780\n There's no major label president that's like,\n\n06:29.780 --> 06:32.480\n Imagine Dragons needs to make pop music, Dan.\n\n06:32.480 --> 06:33.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n06:33.320 --> 06:35.180\n My manager doesn't even tell me that.\n\n06:35.180 --> 06:40.180\n I do it because it's what I perceive to be enjoyable.\n\n06:40.660 --> 06:43.620\n I grew up listening to a ton of pop music,\n\n06:43.620 --> 06:46.660\n and then I ended up being in what is quote, unquote,\n\n06:46.660 --> 06:49.580\n a rock band, which I've never perceived it as that,\n\n06:49.580 --> 06:53.340\n but that's kinda what the world has called it,\n\n06:53.340 --> 06:54.820\n and that's fine, but.\n\n06:56.060 --> 06:58.660\n So you're a prisoner of a prison\n\n06:58.660 --> 07:00.660\n that you yourself constructed.\n\n07:00.660 --> 07:01.500\n There you go.\n\n07:01.500 --> 07:04.580\n Well, I'm a happy, I guess what I'm trying to say\n\n07:04.580 --> 07:06.780\n is I'm a happy prisoner of the prison\n\n07:06.780 --> 07:08.460\n that I have created for myself,\n\n07:08.460 --> 07:11.260\n and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion.\n\n07:11.260 --> 07:12.540\n So you worked with Rick Rubin.\n\n07:12.540 --> 07:14.900\n What does Rick think about your prison?\n\n07:16.260 --> 07:21.260\n Rick was, you know, it was interesting to hear\n\n07:22.420 --> 07:25.220\n his outside opinion when we first met,\n\n07:25.220 --> 07:30.220\n because my biggest focus for so much of my life,\n\n07:30.220 --> 07:34.820\n my biggest fear was, and this stems from, I think,\n\n07:34.820 --> 07:36.060\n middle schools when it started,\n\n07:36.060 --> 07:40.740\n but everyone being in on a joke except for yourself.\n\n07:40.740 --> 07:44.340\n I really, like, the thought of thinking\n\n07:44.340 --> 07:47.840\n you're good at something, and really, you're terrible at it,\n\n07:47.840 --> 07:49.340\n and you're surrounded by people who are saying,\n\n07:49.340 --> 07:50.940\n yeah, you're good at it, and then by themselves,\n\n07:50.940 --> 07:53.100\n they're like, he's terrible at this.\n\n07:53.100 --> 07:56.580\n Just kind of, and not just in regards to music or art,\n\n07:56.580 --> 07:59.020\n but anything in life, and I think maybe\n\n07:59.020 --> 08:02.180\n from having six older brothers, it stems from that too,\n\n08:02.180 --> 08:05.420\n like, always feeling inadequate,\n\n08:05.420 --> 08:08.320\n and like, the annoying younger brother, you know?\n\n08:10.060 --> 08:12.800\n But anyway, so Rick's, and that's something\n\n08:12.800 --> 08:14.460\n I've learned to let go of as I've gotten older\n\n08:14.460 --> 08:18.780\n and had life experiences, but one of the things\n\n08:18.780 --> 08:21.840\n that Rick said really early on that has stuck with me\n\n08:21.840 --> 08:25.000\n was he said, yeah, you know, we're resuming\n\n08:25.000 --> 08:26.340\n the first time we met.\n\n08:26.340 --> 08:27.860\n He said, I'd really like to work with you\n\n08:27.860 --> 08:32.860\n because I feel like you're not confined to a sound.\n\n08:33.900 --> 08:36.060\n You've done a lot of different sounds,\n\n08:36.060 --> 08:38.100\n and so it's exciting because I feel like your fans\n\n08:38.100 --> 08:41.380\n are forgiving more than other rock bands or bands,\n\n08:41.380 --> 08:45.620\n because most people, when they hear a band,\n\n08:45.620 --> 08:47.780\n it's like, there's a very specific sound with it.\n\n08:47.780 --> 08:50.700\n It's like, they do folk music, or they do, like,\n\n08:50.700 --> 08:55.580\n California rock, or they do surf, or they do, you know,\n\n08:55.580 --> 08:59.500\n like, there's, and your fans kind of want that.\n\n08:59.500 --> 09:01.580\n Like, they want them to do that thing,\n\n09:01.580 --> 09:04.300\n and then they don't do it, and sometimes that goes well,\n\n09:04.300 --> 09:07.180\n but a lot of times it doesn't, and people, you know,\n\n09:07.180 --> 09:09.300\n critics and everybody is like, go back to the thing\n\n09:09.300 --> 09:11.440\n that you did good and do that.\n\n09:12.680 --> 09:17.260\n Rick was, felt, whether he was right or wrong,\n\n09:17.260 --> 09:22.260\n that we could do, we hopped genres so much,\n\n09:22.260 --> 09:26.180\n and that's been to our benefit and detriment, I think.\n\n09:27.380 --> 09:28.300\n Why detriment?\n\n09:29.420 --> 09:32.660\n Because people want you to be something.\n\n09:32.660 --> 09:35.500\n It's more, you can believe it more.\n\n09:35.500 --> 09:36.840\n I, you know, it's like.\n\n09:38.380 --> 09:40.540\n It's more authentic if you never change.\n\n09:40.540 --> 09:42.100\n I guess, I don't know.\n\n09:42.100 --> 09:44.900\n I mean, certainly it's not something I subscribe to\n\n09:44.900 --> 09:47.980\n because I create music, but I also grew up listening\n\n09:47.980 --> 09:50.820\n to a lot of different genres, like, cats,\n\n09:50.820 --> 09:53.460\n I would listen to, like, Cat Stevens,\n\n09:53.460 --> 09:55.540\n and the next song would be, like, Biggie,\n\n09:55.540 --> 09:58.140\n and then the next song would be Nirvana,\n\n09:58.140 --> 10:00.740\n and it was like, I like a lot of,\n\n10:00.740 --> 10:03.460\n and then Billy Joel, and then Enya.\n\n10:03.460 --> 10:04.420\n It was like, you know what I mean?\n\n10:04.420 --> 10:07.180\n I was a product, and I was a product of the 90s,\n\n10:07.180 --> 10:09.900\n which, if you listen to 90s music, it really was all,\n\n10:09.900 --> 10:12.580\n a lot of reason that people say, well, 90s were terrible.\n\n10:12.580 --> 10:14.140\n Like, a lot of people say that.\n\n10:14.140 --> 10:16.780\n I love the 90s, they were my favorite decade of music.\n\n10:16.780 --> 10:21.780\n It was, there was a lot of genre hopping,\n\n10:22.020 --> 10:24.940\n and I don't know, I love that.\n\n10:24.940 --> 10:27.740\n She had the, 90s had the boy bands,\n\n10:27.740 --> 10:30.780\n and it had Pearl Jam, and Nirvana.\n\n10:30.780 --> 10:34.020\n And it had a lot of, like, women of the 90s\n\n10:34.020 --> 10:36.660\n was probably, is probably my biggest influence,\n\n10:36.660 --> 10:41.060\n like, kind of that, like, angry rock women of the 90s,\n\n10:41.060 --> 10:43.220\n like, Lannis Morissette, Jagged Little Pills,\n\n10:43.220 --> 10:45.420\n one of my favorite records of all time.\n\n10:45.420 --> 10:48.180\n The lyrics were so intimate,\n\n10:48.180 --> 10:52.260\n and I don't know if she was angry or not.\n\n10:52.260 --> 10:54.140\n Sorry, if she wasn't.\n\n10:54.140 --> 10:55.540\n Yeah, but there was an anger to it.\n\n10:55.540 --> 10:57.700\n There was angst, yeah, it was like angstiness.\n\n10:57.700 --> 11:01.820\n And that in hip hop of the 90s influences me,\n\n11:01.820 --> 11:02.820\n and then my dad.\n\n11:02.820 --> 11:04.140\n So, anything my dad listened to,\n\n11:04.140 --> 11:05.540\n which my dad didn't listen to any of that.\n\n11:05.540 --> 11:08.420\n My dad listened to, like, Harry Nelson and the Beatles,\n\n11:08.420 --> 11:13.420\n Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Billy Joel.\n\n11:13.420 --> 11:15.900\n It was very much like singer, songwriter.\n\n11:15.900 --> 11:17.460\n Do you mind if we, throughout this,\n\n11:17.460 --> 11:18.300\n listen to a few songs?\n\n11:18.300 --> 11:19.380\n Because you mentioned Harry Nelson,\n\n11:19.380 --> 11:23.660\n and I was actually, yesterday and the day before,\n\n11:23.660 --> 11:24.820\n listening to a lot of his stuff,\n\n11:24.820 --> 11:28.560\n and it's just like, damn, he's good.\n\n11:28.560 --> 11:33.140\n And not as known as he should be.\n\n11:33.140 --> 11:35.980\n Like, I was getting, do you mind if I play?\n\n11:35.980 --> 11:37.140\n No, please, yeah.\n\n11:37.140 --> 11:41.420\n I don't know, not to open this conversation\n\n11:41.420 --> 11:43.460\n to the love song.\n\n11:43.460 --> 11:45.060\n I would like that, actually, Lex.\n\n11:46.780 --> 11:49.740\n But Without You is an incredible song.\n\n11:49.740 --> 11:51.400\n Oh, man, that's, yeah.\n\n11:52.820 --> 11:56.020\n And the heartbreak and the longing.\n\n11:57.940 --> 12:02.740\n No, I can't forget the feeling of your face.\n\n12:02.740 --> 12:04.940\n He's the best to do it, in my opinion.\n\n12:04.940 --> 12:06.260\n In my opinion, he's the best to do it.\n\n12:06.260 --> 12:10.900\n But I guess that's just the way the story goes.\n\n12:10.900 --> 12:13.260\n And just the sadness of, like,\n\n12:17.780 --> 12:21.300\n there's something, I don't even wanna talk over him,\n\n12:21.300 --> 12:23.100\n because this is one of my favorite songs, too,\n\n12:23.100 --> 12:28.100\n but I think people have a really good bullshit indicator.\n\n12:30.020 --> 12:34.940\n And music, in my opinion,\n\n12:34.940 --> 12:36.540\n whenever I meet a young artist and say,\n\n12:36.540 --> 12:38.380\n well, I'm trying to make a new band,\n\n12:38.380 --> 12:40.900\n and I wanna do something like how to be successful,\n\n12:40.900 --> 12:44.340\n I really think understanding\n\n12:44.340 --> 12:47.460\n that people have a really good bullshit indicator\n\n12:47.460 --> 12:50.920\n is the most important part of being an artist.\n\n12:50.920 --> 12:53.980\n And I'll explain what that means, at least to me.\n\n12:55.340 --> 13:00.340\n I think that in order to have success\n\n13:01.420 --> 13:05.860\n or be a leader or whether it's an art or anything,\n\n13:05.860 --> 13:08.700\n people need to believe that you believe what you're doing.\n\n13:11.500 --> 13:13.780\n I think the best actors,\n\n13:13.780 --> 13:15.540\n really, when they're doing their thing,\n\n13:15.540 --> 13:18.420\n it's like they, it's not acting.\n\n13:18.420 --> 13:22.100\n They're in it, and it's how they feel,\n\n13:22.100 --> 13:25.820\n and they're expressing that sorrow or joy or whatever it is.\n\n13:25.820 --> 13:30.820\n Harry, for me, Harry Nilsen, I just believe it.\n\n13:30.900 --> 13:33.660\n He sings that, and I feel it.\n\n13:33.660 --> 13:36.860\n And whether he's the greatest bullshitter of all time,\n\n13:36.860 --> 13:37.960\n I don't think that's the case.\n\n13:37.960 --> 13:39.580\n I think he probably was singing that song,\n\n13:39.580 --> 13:43.400\n and he just could transport himself to wherever he was.\n\n13:44.620 --> 13:46.880\n It's what makes a great live act.\n\n13:46.880 --> 13:49.260\n It's what makes a great song.\n\n13:49.260 --> 13:51.660\n And someone could be the best actor\n\n13:51.660 --> 13:56.380\n and sing that in the same timbre, same EQ,\n\n13:56.380 --> 13:59.140\n same compression, same everything.\n\n13:59.140 --> 14:02.160\n And there's some unknown there that I,\n\n14:02.160 --> 14:06.080\n I think, hopefully, it will be known at some point,\n\n14:06.080 --> 14:07.040\n and it's some scientific thing,\n\n14:07.040 --> 14:10.480\n but there's something there, the energy or something,\n\n14:10.480 --> 14:14.640\n that people can perceive it and say true or false.\n\n14:14.640 --> 14:18.080\n And if it resonates as true, it's so much more meaningful,\n\n14:18.080 --> 14:19.360\n and it lives on.\n\n14:19.360 --> 14:24.600\n And if it doesn't, that, for me, is what is good art or bad.\n\n14:24.600 --> 14:25.960\n For people to dispute over,\n\n14:25.960 --> 14:28.000\n well, sonics should sound like that, silly to me.\n\n14:28.000 --> 14:32.180\n It's like a song or even a painting, like,\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:36.000\n it's just the truthfulness of it.\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:40.480\n Yeah, the truly great art goes,\n\n14:40.480 --> 14:44.280\n has to go to that place where you really are feeling it.\n\n14:44.280 --> 14:46.160\n Like, you forget that you're being recorded.\n\n14:46.160 --> 14:47.560\n You forget there's an audience.\n\n14:47.560 --> 14:48.880\n You really are feeling it.\n\n14:50.280 --> 14:53.160\n Yeah, which I totally agree with you.\n\n14:53.160 --> 14:56.060\n One of the things that I love about the internet\n\n14:56.060 --> 15:01.060\n is it's brought the bullshit detector of the masses\n\n15:02.960 --> 15:04.960\n to power, which is beautiful,\n\n15:04.960 --> 15:09.040\n because then the masses uplift the really authentic.\n\n15:09.040 --> 15:11.840\n And even if you didn't write the song,\n\n15:11.840 --> 15:15.160\n I think it helps a lot, probably, if you wrote the song.\n\n15:15.160 --> 15:19.000\n But I was a little bit, maybe a lot,\n\n15:19.000 --> 15:21.000\n since we're in Vegas, a little heartbroken\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:24.480\n that to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs.\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:29.480\n But I like, for example, Rocketman, Elton John,\n\n15:30.620 --> 15:33.900\n like, to find out that Elton John didn't really know\n\n15:33.900 --> 15:36.500\n where the words of Rocketman came from,\n\n15:36.500 --> 15:39.260\n meaning, like, the depths of it, it's interesting.\n\n15:39.260 --> 15:42.060\n But nevertheless, he's super authentic,\n\n15:42.060 --> 15:44.740\n because for Elton John and for Elvis,\n\n15:44.740 --> 15:48.320\n there's something in the fun and the darkness\n\n15:48.320 --> 15:49.620\n and the entertainment of it.\n\n15:49.620 --> 15:51.740\n Like, he goes to someplace in his mind\n\n15:51.740 --> 15:53.500\n that might not be deeply connected\n\n15:53.500 --> 15:55.700\n from where the lyrics came from.\n\n15:55.700 --> 15:56.780\n But he relates it.\n\n15:56.780 --> 15:59.540\n He relates it to whatever is in his mind\n\n15:59.540 --> 16:01.420\n and goes to that place emotionally.\n\n16:01.420 --> 16:03.220\n Yeah, and that's what I think it is.\n\n16:03.220 --> 16:04.740\n And that's why an actor, like I said,\n\n16:04.740 --> 16:07.260\n can be completely honest to me.\n\n16:07.260 --> 16:08.980\n Maybe they didn't write the script.\n\n16:08.980 --> 16:12.480\n But I write, like, I've always written all my own lyrics.\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:14.960\n It's a really personal thing to me.\n\n16:14.960 --> 16:18.440\n But I will say, I see people all the time\n\n16:18.440 --> 16:22.140\n who are performers like Elton John, for instance,\n\n16:22.140 --> 16:26.140\n who didn't write the lyrics that I believe\n\n16:26.140 --> 16:29.500\n that it means just as much to them as what I wrote,\n\n16:29.500 --> 16:33.220\n because they find the meaning in it for themself.\n\n16:33.220 --> 16:34.500\n At least the greats do.\n\n16:34.500 --> 16:37.580\n And I think that's the difference maker.\n\n16:37.580 --> 16:39.160\n And I think you can perceive,\n\n16:39.160 --> 16:43.080\n and I'm sure you've seen art that doesn't move you,\n\n16:43.080 --> 16:44.260\n and maybe it moves someone else.\n\n16:44.260 --> 16:45.660\n But for you, for some reason,\n\n16:45.660 --> 16:50.100\n you perceive it to be uninteresting to you.\n\n16:50.100 --> 16:52.060\n And I feel like a lot of the time,\n\n16:52.060 --> 16:53.780\n I'm saying that it's, of course, sonically,\n\n16:53.780 --> 16:54.900\n maybe it's uninteresting to you.\n\n16:54.900 --> 16:58.020\n But I think the majority of the time, for myself,\n\n16:58.020 --> 17:02.420\n I can find inspiration in any sonic value or painting\n\n17:02.420 --> 17:04.780\n as long as I see it and I feel truth\n\n17:04.780 --> 17:06.900\n from the person that created it.\n\n17:06.900 --> 17:10.420\n Yeah, and for me, the lyrics,\n\n17:10.420 --> 17:12.040\n maybe not the entirety of the lyrics,\n\n17:12.040 --> 17:16.180\n but a few words can do wonders to take you to a place.\n\n17:16.180 --> 17:18.260\n And sometimes those words don't need to be connected\n\n17:18.260 --> 17:19.600\n with the other words.\n\n17:19.600 --> 17:21.260\n That's the beauty of music.\n\n17:21.260 --> 17:25.500\n They're allowed to float in the space of mixed metaphors.\n\n17:25.500 --> 17:27.100\n They're allowed to just jump around,\n\n17:27.100 --> 17:29.540\n and somehow it paints a picture without actually,\n\n17:31.040 --> 17:33.180\n what is it, glycerine by Bush?\n\n17:33.180 --> 17:35.820\n Right, but it's also how the person says it, right?\n\n17:35.820 --> 17:39.940\n It's like, it's the feeling of exactly,\n\n17:39.940 --> 17:42.420\n and the same person could say that word 10 other ways\n\n17:42.420 --> 17:43.660\n and you don't care.\n\n17:43.660 --> 17:46.120\n But someone says glycerine or whatever it is,\n\n17:46.120 --> 17:48.620\n and it's like, oh, you know what?\n\n17:48.620 --> 17:51.060\n I feel that for some reason.\n\n17:51.060 --> 17:53.420\n The way he said that, he meant it to me.\n\n17:53.420 --> 17:54.420\n You know what I mean?\n\n17:56.700 --> 17:59.220\n No, I can't forget this evening\n\n17:59.220 --> 18:00.980\n or your face as you were leaving,\n\n18:00.980 --> 18:03.480\n but I guess that's just the way the story goes.\n\n18:04.580 --> 18:07.700\n You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows.\n\n18:07.700 --> 18:08.800\n Yes, it shows.\n\n18:10.380 --> 18:12.280\n Let me ask you to analyze this song.\n\n18:13.500 --> 18:18.500\n Do you, so there's a lady possibly who's leaving him.\n\n18:18.500 --> 18:21.440\n Do you think he's leaving her or she's leaving him?\n\n18:22.580 --> 18:23.420\n She went to.\n\n18:24.380 --> 18:29.380\n When I think of all my sorrow, and I had you there,\n\n18:29.820 --> 18:32.280\n but then I let you go.\n\n18:34.640 --> 18:39.640\n And now it's only fair that I should let you know\n\n18:41.980 --> 18:43.380\n what you should know.\n\n18:43.380 --> 18:45.260\n And then the chorus says, I can't live\n\n18:45.260 --> 18:46.860\n if living is without you.\n\n18:46.860 --> 18:49.020\n I can't live, I can't give anymore.\n\n18:52.060 --> 18:53.620\n He's got a voice on him.\n\n18:53.620 --> 18:54.580\n Yeah, he does.\n\n18:54.580 --> 18:57.740\n And if you really, there's been some incredible\n\n18:57.740 --> 19:00.520\n documentation on his life and the end of his life.\n\n19:00.520 --> 19:04.800\n And so my answer to this is probably skewed\n\n19:04.800 --> 19:06.920\n based on what I've seen about his life too,\n\n19:06.920 --> 19:10.600\n but he was a real alcoholic at the end of his life\n\n19:10.600 --> 19:15.600\n and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well.\n\n19:18.700 --> 19:22.540\n And so when I hear that, I perceive it as\n\n19:25.300 --> 19:28.340\n someone who is destructive and in a destructive place\n\n19:28.340 --> 19:30.860\n in life and can't love someone properly.\n\n19:30.860 --> 19:32.140\n And so they can't live with them,\n\n19:32.140 --> 19:34.100\n but they can't live without them type thing,\n\n19:34.100 --> 19:36.720\n which is really something that I really identify with\n\n19:36.720 --> 19:41.720\n and I think is one of the struggles of life\n\n19:42.220 --> 19:47.220\n is loving yourself enough, forgiving yourself for things\n\n19:50.060 --> 19:52.100\n and letting yourself love someone else.\n\n19:52.100 --> 19:56.260\n And at least when I listened out, I hear Harry being like,\n\n19:56.260 --> 19:58.460\n and maybe I'm wrong, but this is how I perceive it at least\n\n19:58.460 --> 20:03.460\n is not loving himself and feeling like he's deserving\n\n20:04.500 --> 20:06.260\n of this person, like I have to let you go.\n\n20:06.260 --> 20:07.660\n I hear that, of course, and people always say,\n\n20:07.660 --> 20:09.380\n oh, well, he's breaking up with her,\n\n20:09.380 --> 20:11.460\n but there's so much more complexity and nuance\n\n20:11.460 --> 20:15.340\n to relationships than that and my wife and I\n\n20:15.340 --> 20:17.860\n went through really difficult separation\n\n20:19.620 --> 20:22.460\n and that's a story for another day\n\n20:22.460 --> 20:24.100\n or different question or something,\n\n20:24.100 --> 20:27.860\n but the nuance of it makes me think of this\n\n20:27.860 --> 20:32.260\n when I hear this, which is there's just more\n\n20:32.260 --> 20:34.540\n to being with someone or not being with someone\n\n20:34.540 --> 20:37.900\n than hey, I think that person's really attractive\n\n20:37.900 --> 20:40.020\n or hey, that person makes me laugh or not\n\n20:40.020 --> 20:42.420\n or I love them and now I don't love them.\n\n20:42.420 --> 20:44.700\n Love is such a complex, nuanced thing\n\n20:44.700 --> 20:47.620\n that a lot of times, there's just more going on\n\n20:47.620 --> 20:49.540\n behind the scenes, I think.\n\n20:49.540 --> 20:52.500\n Yeah, and a small tangent on that,\n\n20:52.500 --> 20:56.180\n just as a curious question, have you paid any attention\n\n20:56.180 --> 20:58.820\n to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials?\n\n20:58.820 --> 21:00.940\n I have watched quite a bit of it\n\n21:00.940 --> 21:02.500\n because my wife really loves it\n\n21:02.500 --> 21:04.660\n and she watches it in bed at night.\n\n21:04.660 --> 21:06.620\n So it's raw, to me it's really,\n\n21:06.620 --> 21:10.380\n because you've mentioned how complicated love can be\n\n21:10.380 --> 21:12.700\n and it's, I've never seen, I don't care\n\n21:12.700 --> 21:14.300\n about the celebrity nature of it.\n\n21:14.300 --> 21:17.900\n I don't care if it was, I don't care who it is,\n\n21:17.900 --> 21:21.180\n but it's just laid out in such raw form.\n\n21:21.180 --> 21:22.980\n For the world to see it.\n\n21:22.980 --> 21:24.860\n For the world to see the toxicity,\n\n21:24.860 --> 21:29.860\n but also the passion and clearly the drugs\n\n21:29.860 --> 21:33.900\n and the drinking, but also like the longing\n\n21:33.900 --> 21:36.700\n and the dreams and I will always be with you,\n\n21:36.700 --> 21:41.220\n I will die for you, the places, the rollercoaster of love\n\n21:41.220 --> 21:46.220\n and it's all there at the end, past the end.\n\n21:47.020 --> 21:49.900\n So it's like, I've also recently reread\n\n21:49.900 --> 21:51.660\n The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\n\n21:51.660 --> 21:53.780\n about Hitler and Nazi Germany.\n\n21:53.780 --> 21:56.520\n It's the rise and the fall and it's interesting\n\n21:56.520 --> 21:58.820\n to look at the entirety of that process\n\n21:58.820 --> 22:02.420\n after it's all over, many, many decades after it's all over.\n\n22:02.420 --> 22:04.220\n That book in particular written by the person\n\n22:04.220 --> 22:07.460\n that was actually there and so here we're seeing\n\n22:07.460 --> 22:11.100\n two people in the context of the courtroom\n\n22:11.100 --> 22:14.100\n analyzing this rise and fall of a love affair.\n\n22:15.180 --> 22:16.020\n It's fascinating.\n\n22:16.020 --> 22:18.440\n You know the truth is, I was telling my wife this actually\n\n22:18.440 --> 22:20.420\n just the other day because she was asking me\n\n22:20.420 --> 22:22.300\n what I thought about it.\n\n22:22.300 --> 22:24.840\n It makes me really sad.\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:26.780\n It's humorous, don't get me wrong.\n\n22:26.780 --> 22:29.980\n There's a lot of parts in it that are just really funny.\n\n22:30.900 --> 22:34.620\n But I look at it and I also see the internet\n\n22:34.620 --> 22:38.260\n and someone's always the villain and someone's the hero\n\n22:38.260 --> 22:40.780\n which is such a funny thing and we talked a little\n\n22:40.780 --> 22:42.160\n about this offline before we got on this\n\n22:42.160 --> 22:44.420\n but I have a real firm belief in life\n\n22:44.420 --> 22:49.420\n that it's just more complex than you think, always, always.\n\n22:50.860 --> 22:54.100\n Johnny for instance is very charismatic\n\n22:54.100 --> 22:58.460\n and you love him and he's funny and the way he does things\n\n22:58.460 --> 23:00.660\n and he looks certain ways and he says things.\n\n23:02.580 --> 23:04.380\n You really love him and I feel like,\n\n23:04.380 --> 23:05.660\n and maybe I'm wrong on this but it looks like\n\n23:05.660 --> 23:09.260\n the internet is really, Johnny is the winner,\n\n23:09.260 --> 23:13.260\n Amber is the villain and I kind of look at it\n\n23:13.260 --> 23:16.980\n and I feel like, were any of you in their bedroom?\n\n23:16.980 --> 23:19.500\n Were any of you there for these things?\n\n23:19.500 --> 23:22.540\n And I'm not saying one way or the other.\n\n23:22.540 --> 23:26.160\n All I see when I look at that is two people\n\n23:26.160 --> 23:30.140\n with a lot of deep seeded hurt, anger\n\n23:30.140 --> 23:32.940\n and that anger is so poisonous to both of them\n\n23:32.940 --> 23:34.720\n and they're getting through it in the way\n\n23:34.720 --> 23:38.100\n that they only know how and I'm not saying\n\n23:38.100 --> 23:40.660\n we shouldn't be able to look at parts of it\n\n23:40.660 --> 23:43.620\n and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something\n\n23:43.620 --> 23:46.740\n but just that there's not a hero.\n\n23:46.740 --> 23:47.860\n It's more complicated.\n\n23:47.860 --> 23:52.020\n Yeah, I think unless you've been living with Amber\n\n23:52.020 --> 23:53.700\n and Johnny, you don't know and just because\n\n23:53.700 --> 23:55.580\n one seems more charismatic in the moment\n\n23:55.580 --> 23:58.340\n or funnier or more believable even,\n\n23:58.340 --> 24:01.740\n doesn't mean that their truth is the truth.\n\n24:04.180 --> 24:06.820\n And I feel like there's still love there too,\n\n24:06.820 --> 24:07.660\n which makes the whole thing.\n\n24:07.660 --> 24:08.480\n Oh, that's the hardest part.\n\n24:08.480 --> 24:09.740\n He won't even look at her.\n\n24:09.740 --> 24:12.660\n He looks down the whole time and maybe people say,\n\n24:12.660 --> 24:17.020\n well, it's because anger or hurt or whatever\n\n24:17.020 --> 24:18.840\n but the way that she looks and stuff,\n\n24:18.840 --> 24:22.180\n it just feels like there's so much hurt there\n\n24:23.060 --> 24:25.180\n that it hurts me to watch it.\n\n24:25.180 --> 24:28.140\n I just feel like, oh, my heart just aches for them\n\n24:28.140 --> 24:30.660\n and for both of them and I don't know either of them\n\n24:30.660 --> 24:35.100\n personally and I don't know, just hurts.\n\n24:35.100 --> 24:38.860\n I've never seen love laid out in this raw kind of way.\n\n24:38.860 --> 24:42.260\n It makes me feel better about,\n\n24:44.060 --> 24:47.580\n it almost gives you, seeing people have gone through\n\n24:47.580 --> 24:51.340\n a struggle in this sort of mundane kind of way,\n\n24:51.340 --> 24:54.180\n gives you room to struggle yourself\n\n24:54.180 --> 24:56.020\n about the messiness of love.\n\n24:56.020 --> 24:57.540\n Like you're supposed to,\n\n24:57.540 --> 25:00.460\n like relationship is supposed to be simple and whatever\n\n25:00.460 --> 25:02.260\n but this like, oh, man, this.\n\n25:02.260 --> 25:03.680\n It's like art.\n\n25:03.680 --> 25:05.060\n Yeah.\n\n25:05.060 --> 25:09.260\n And for the record, I don't feel like it shouldn't be shown.\n\n25:09.260 --> 25:11.680\n I think it's actually really beautiful art\n\n25:11.680 --> 25:13.060\n and I agree there's gonna be a lot of people\n\n25:13.060 --> 25:15.480\n who walk away from it and are changed in certain ways\n\n25:15.480 --> 25:16.820\n or look at things different.\n\n25:16.820 --> 25:18.020\n I'm not saying it's changed in the whole world,\n\n25:18.020 --> 25:19.620\n the Johnny Depp trial, but it's art.\n\n25:19.620 --> 25:20.980\n It's just like you would look at a painting\n\n25:20.980 --> 25:22.180\n and it might affect you.\n\n25:23.480 --> 25:27.160\n My only commentary is more that there's not,\n\n25:27.160 --> 25:29.220\n I think it's silly when people say who's right\n\n25:29.220 --> 25:31.940\n and who's wrong and who's the clear villain and who's the,\n\n25:31.940 --> 25:34.700\n like we love as human, we have to have an answer for every,\n\n25:34.700 --> 25:36.020\n we have to put everything in a box.\n\n25:36.020 --> 25:37.620\n And it's like, well, we're looking at this\n\n25:37.620 --> 25:41.020\n and we're deciding you're right and you're wrong.\n\n25:41.020 --> 25:44.420\n And I just think it's silly unless it's your life.\n\n25:44.420 --> 25:47.060\n So speaking of heroes and villains and highs and lows,\n\n25:47.060 --> 25:49.820\n you grew up in Las Vegas.\n\n25:49.820 --> 25:52.060\n And you said that Vegas is a performing town,\n\n25:52.060 --> 25:55.040\n a town of high stakes, drama and eccentricity.\n\n25:55.900 --> 25:58.320\n It's a town of high highs and low lows.\n\n25:58.320 --> 26:00.460\n And I'll be damned if my therapist didn't point out\n\n26:00.460 --> 26:03.100\n that correlation out to me personally a long time ago.\n\n26:04.780 --> 26:09.140\n So to me, Vegas from the outside is romanticized\n\n26:09.140 --> 26:09.980\n by certain movies.\n\n26:09.980 --> 26:14.200\n The lows define the beauty of this town.\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:19.200\n And certain movies, so to me, Casino with Robert De Niro,\n\n26:21.180 --> 26:25.260\n Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone, leaving Las Vegas\n\n26:25.260 --> 26:29.260\n with Nicolas Cage, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n\n26:29.260 --> 26:34.260\n with the Johnny Depp play, Hunter S. Thompson.\n\n26:35.620 --> 26:38.700\n First of all, what's your favorite representation\n\n26:38.700 --> 26:41.740\n of Vegas from a darker side?\n\n26:41.740 --> 26:46.740\n And do you draw any wisdom insight from the darkness,\n\n26:47.660 --> 26:49.940\n the lows and the highs in those movies?\n\n26:49.940 --> 26:51.500\n Or is it over romanticized?\n\n26:52.540 --> 26:56.460\n So I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family.\n\n26:56.460 --> 27:00.920\n And Vegas was established by the Mormons and the mob.\n\n27:00.920 --> 27:05.020\n Those were like the two very different worlds\n\n27:05.020 --> 27:06.680\n that created what Vegas is.\n\n27:06.680 --> 27:09.760\n And if you live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways\n\n27:09.760 --> 27:13.680\n because Vegas has the strip and the parties\n\n27:13.680 --> 27:14.520\n and the craziness.\n\n27:14.520 --> 27:18.980\n But it also has very neighborhoods and big families\n\n27:18.980 --> 27:23.980\n and conservative people and liberal people living together\n\n27:24.620 --> 27:26.180\n in a really interesting way.\n\n27:27.060 --> 27:32.060\n And for me, growing up here, for instance,\n\n27:32.400 --> 27:34.060\n was a lot of driving on the freeway,\n\n27:34.060 --> 27:36.200\n my mom being like, children, close your eyes.\n\n27:36.200 --> 27:38.540\n There's a naked woman on that billboard and everything.\n\n27:38.540 --> 27:40.420\n Okay, mom, on our way to church.\n\n27:40.420 --> 27:41.260\n You know what I mean?\n\n27:41.260 --> 27:44.140\n It was like, but also being like, whoa, this is crazy.\n\n27:44.140 --> 27:44.980\n You know what I mean?\n\n27:44.980 --> 27:47.500\n Like taking in whatever I could when I could.\n\n27:49.500 --> 27:53.060\n So I saw, and I'm grateful for that.\n\n27:53.060 --> 27:55.180\n Like, I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon\n\n27:55.180 --> 27:57.060\n in for instance, like Utah or something,\n\n27:57.060 --> 28:00.420\n like the typical place, because I saw both sides\n\n28:00.420 --> 28:03.100\n and I appreciated something from both sides.\n\n28:03.100 --> 28:05.580\n And now as a person now who's not religious,\n\n28:05.580 --> 28:06.940\n but just spiritually minded,\n\n28:06.940 --> 28:11.940\n you know, I'm grateful for that divergent character,\n\n28:13.340 --> 28:17.380\n that juxtaposition, dual edged sword that Vegas is.\n\n28:17.380 --> 28:19.880\n And I try to apply that to everything in life,\n\n28:19.880 --> 28:23.140\n which is like Johnny Depp and Amber.\n\n28:23.140 --> 28:25.020\n It's like, there's two sides to every story.\n\n28:25.020 --> 28:26.680\n There's always two sides to every coin.\n\n28:26.680 --> 28:29.440\n There's always, and there's something to be said for both.\n\n28:29.440 --> 28:33.860\n Like I try to see people and even if, you know,\n\n28:33.860 --> 28:36.340\n it's just, yeah, I try to apply that to life.\n\n28:36.340 --> 28:39.580\n As far as a movie that personifies Vegas\n\n28:39.580 --> 28:42.740\n or something in that medium that personifies Vegas\n\n28:42.740 --> 28:46.140\n in a way that resonates with me.\n\n28:46.140 --> 28:47.560\n Don't say Hangover.\n\n28:47.560 --> 28:49.460\n No, no, yeah.\n\n28:49.460 --> 28:51.960\n I also like, I wasn't even allowed to watch\n\n28:51.960 --> 28:53.900\n PG 13 movies growing up.\n\n28:53.900 --> 28:56.220\n So a lot of the movies that you're saying,\n\n28:56.220 --> 28:59.740\n like I either didn't see, I didn't have cable television.\n\n28:59.740 --> 29:00.940\n You know, I wasn't like a pilgrim,\n\n29:00.940 --> 29:03.540\n but I had a really, really conservative upbringing.\n\n29:03.540 --> 29:08.100\n So it didn't define your intellectual like development.\n\n29:08.100 --> 29:11.140\n No, no, I just, I can't think of any movie\n\n29:11.140 --> 29:13.740\n that comes to mind where I'm like, that's my Vegas movie.\n\n29:13.740 --> 29:14.580\n You know what I mean?\n\n29:14.580 --> 29:16.500\n Like, I'm sure I've seen some of the movies you've said now,\n\n29:16.500 --> 29:19.340\n but I don't, I can't think of one that I'm like,\n\n29:20.180 --> 29:25.100\n actually personifies Vegas in a way that feels honest to me.\n\n29:25.100 --> 29:27.860\n Like, or like, wasn't there a Chevy,\n\n29:27.860 --> 29:29.020\n was there a Chevy Chase?\n\n29:29.020 --> 29:30.340\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n29:30.340 --> 29:31.860\n I think that's maybe the only one I thought of\n\n29:31.860 --> 29:33.740\n that came to mind where I was like,\n\n29:33.740 --> 29:34.700\n cause I love Chevy Chase so much\n\n29:34.700 --> 29:38.180\n that maybe it's one of his Vegas vacation or something.\n\n29:38.180 --> 29:41.660\n Yeah, so, but that's more like lighthearted surge,\n\n29:41.660 --> 29:42.500\n that kind of stuff.\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:44.380\n Right, it's not like, I guess what I would say\n\n29:44.380 --> 29:48.100\n is there's no truth that has been, that I've seen of Vegas.\n\n29:48.100 --> 29:49.860\n Cause what I see of Vegas is,\n\n29:52.420 --> 29:54.020\n there's obviously like the parties and stuff\n\n29:54.020 --> 29:56.440\n and the nightlife, which I'm not big party person.\n\n29:56.440 --> 29:58.840\n So it's, I haven't really experienced much of that,\n\n29:58.840 --> 30:03.700\n but there's also drugs and I have a strange relationship\n\n30:03.700 --> 30:05.180\n with drugs because I've lost a few friends\n\n30:05.180 --> 30:06.300\n to drug overdoses.\n\n30:06.300 --> 30:09.500\n And so I don't, that's not romantic to me,\n\n30:09.500 --> 30:12.620\n but there's also like, yeah, I mean,\n\n30:12.620 --> 30:14.500\n you asked for a dark reflection of it.\n\n30:14.500 --> 30:17.940\n I guess I certainly see a dark reflection to Vegas.\n\n30:17.940 --> 30:20.540\n And I don't, I feel like Vegas is typically personified\n\n30:20.540 --> 30:22.780\n as like at the tables and everything.\n\n30:22.780 --> 30:25.180\n But it's also like, I have like friends\n\n30:25.180 --> 30:27.660\n who've lost all their money to gambling addiction.\n\n30:27.660 --> 30:31.100\n And so it's like, what I guess the whole thing.\n\n30:31.100 --> 30:32.860\n Yeah, somebody maybe needs to make,\n\n30:32.860 --> 30:33.920\n maybe that's an open spot.\n\n30:33.920 --> 30:36.820\n There needs to be a dark side to Vegas.\n\n30:36.820 --> 30:39.100\n Well, it's about Mormons in Vegas,\n\n30:39.100 --> 30:42.560\n dying to drug overdose or getting shot by the mob.\n\n30:42.560 --> 30:43.400\n Yeah.\n\n30:45.620 --> 30:48.300\n So you mentioned your spirituality.\n\n30:48.300 --> 30:51.820\n You've, you said that having a crisis of faith\n\n30:51.820 --> 30:56.820\n or just the philosophical question of asking who is God,\n\n30:56.820 --> 30:58.460\n does God exist?\n\n30:59.340 --> 31:01.860\n Or in thinking of the flip side of that,\n\n31:01.860 --> 31:04.460\n of mortality, what happens when we die?\n\n31:04.460 --> 31:07.580\n Those kinds of things were extremely difficult,\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:12.580\n deep things for you in terms of your development,\n\n31:12.900 --> 31:14.900\n the whole process of figuring that out.\n\n31:15.940 --> 31:18.500\n Why does it hurt so much to lose faith in God?\n\n31:20.260 --> 31:22.940\n Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God,\n\n31:22.940 --> 31:25.460\n let's say that, is an obsession for me\n\n31:25.460 --> 31:27.660\n and has been since I was young.\n\n31:27.660 --> 31:31.440\n I really feel that I'm a deep, deep,\n\n31:31.440 --> 31:36.440\n deeply committed to finding answers in life.\n\n31:37.340 --> 31:38.900\n And there's some answers that I don't think\n\n31:38.900 --> 31:39.740\n there's an answer to.\n\n31:39.740 --> 31:42.100\n And I'm also very OCD by nature,\n\n31:42.100 --> 31:43.940\n so I just don't give up to that.\n\n31:43.940 --> 31:46.980\n I'm like, well, there must be somewhere in Tibet,\n\n31:46.980 --> 31:49.980\n there's some teacher or there's somebody out there\n\n31:49.980 --> 31:51.700\n that has the answer,\n\n31:51.700 --> 31:55.460\n or maybe it's yet to be found, I'm gonna find it.\n\n31:55.460 --> 31:59.660\n I'm really, my life has been to date\n\n31:59.660 --> 32:03.620\n probably unhealthily committed to finding answers\n\n32:03.620 --> 32:08.620\n about God or the lack thereof and mortality.\n\n32:10.420 --> 32:11.500\n It's all I sing about.\n\n32:11.500 --> 32:13.860\n It's all our records have been about.\n\n32:13.860 --> 32:15.540\n Who do you think is God?\n\n32:15.540 --> 32:17.660\n Have you ever gotten a glimpse?\n\n32:17.660 --> 32:20.260\n You know, I will say the closest I feel like\n\n32:20.260 --> 32:23.820\n I have been to experiencing God is,\n\n32:24.860 --> 32:29.860\n and this sounds so, maybe, I don't know.\n\n32:29.980 --> 32:30.820\n I don't know how it sounds,\n\n32:30.820 --> 32:33.580\n but it's through ayahuasca for me.\n\n32:33.580 --> 32:34.580\n That's my honest answer for you.\n\n32:34.580 --> 32:38.100\n I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope\n\n32:38.100 --> 32:42.020\n of there being anything greater than, you know,\n\n32:42.940 --> 32:47.700\n us being, you know, evolving and being here and then dying\n\n32:47.700 --> 32:50.140\n and you're gone and that's it and nothingness\n\n32:50.140 --> 32:53.180\n and from nothingness we came and nothingness we go.\n\n32:53.180 --> 32:57.660\n To where I am now, which is there are answers to be found.\n\n32:57.660 --> 32:58.900\n I don't know them.\n\n32:58.900 --> 33:00.300\n Like, I don't know what God looks like\n\n33:00.300 --> 33:03.020\n or if God has anything to do with the word God\n\n33:03.020 --> 33:04.780\n and the way that we say it,\n\n33:04.780 --> 33:07.260\n but I do believe pretty fervently\n\n33:07.260 --> 33:11.420\n that there is more to be found.\n\n33:11.420 --> 33:13.100\n Is it motion sensor or no?\n\n33:13.100 --> 33:14.140\n I don't know what that was.\n\n33:14.140 --> 33:16.100\n Looked like they've all died, actually.\n\n33:17.500 --> 33:18.340\n Do you know which one of it?\n\n33:18.340 --> 33:19.620\n Is it this one right here?\n\n33:19.620 --> 33:21.940\n Why don't I just take it out, but then it'd be too dark.\n\n33:21.940 --> 33:22.780\n That's fine.\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:25.020\n Take it out.\n\n33:27.420 --> 33:29.620\n Do you want to hold this chair?\n\n33:29.620 --> 33:31.060\n See if I can get it like this.\n\n33:31.060 --> 33:31.900\n Yeah.\n\n33:35.660 --> 33:37.300\n Almost there.\n\n33:37.300 --> 33:39.860\n I really don't know how I'm gonna catch this though.\n\n33:39.860 --> 33:44.620\n It's gotta be like something saying about this.\n\n33:44.620 --> 33:45.620\n There we go.\n\n33:47.020 --> 33:47.980\n It's my Chinese proverb.\n\n33:47.980 --> 33:49.820\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n33:49.820 --> 33:51.820\n How many people does it take to,\n\n33:51.820 --> 33:53.420\n what is it, unscrew a light bulb?\n\n33:53.420 --> 33:54.260\n A light bulb.\n\n33:54.260 --> 33:55.100\n It was hot too.\n\n33:55.100 --> 33:57.860\n It was like I was doing the two finger technique.\n\n33:57.860 --> 33:58.700\n Yeah.\n\n33:58.700 --> 34:00.060\n Well, I'm glad you survived that.\n\n34:00.060 --> 34:01.060\n Thanks.\n\n34:01.060 --> 34:03.340\n That'd be pretty ironic if we're talking about mortality\n\n34:03.340 --> 34:05.300\n and then this would be it for you.\n\n34:05.300 --> 34:06.140\n In that moment.\n\n34:07.900 --> 34:11.260\n I've never done ayahuasca, so it's a mixture of two plants.\n\n34:11.260 --> 34:14.940\n One of them is DMT, but a lot of people I really respect.\n\n34:14.940 --> 34:19.940\n Very, very intelligent people had profound experiences\n\n34:20.180 --> 34:21.500\n with ayahuasca.\n\n34:21.500 --> 34:22.540\n What is that?\n\n34:22.540 --> 34:23.380\n Where do you go?\n\n34:23.380 --> 34:24.220\n Where does the mind go?\n\n34:24.220 --> 34:26.340\n What the heck is up with that?\n\n34:26.340 --> 34:29.940\n I'll first say that I can't even smoke weed.\n\n34:29.940 --> 34:34.940\n I really do not enjoy it because I hate to let go of control.\n\n34:37.180 --> 34:39.820\n If I feel out of control in life,\n\n34:39.820 --> 34:41.900\n it's like one of my biggest weaknesses.\n\n34:41.900 --> 34:43.700\n It's like very scary for me.\n\n34:43.700 --> 34:48.420\n And some people really enjoy letting go in that way.\n\n34:48.420 --> 34:50.020\n I really don't.\n\n34:50.020 --> 34:53.980\n So I was pretty terrified to make the jump then to ayahuasca.\n\n34:53.980 --> 34:57.060\n But my wife who I deeply respect\n\n34:59.580 --> 35:02.380\n made a profound change through ayahuasca.\n\n35:03.260 --> 35:04.100\n And I saw it.\n\n35:04.100 --> 35:05.060\n She led the way.\n\n35:05.060 --> 35:05.900\n Yeah.\n\n35:05.900 --> 35:08.420\n And it wasn't a strange, like I think most,\n\n35:08.420 --> 35:11.980\n we have a thing in America that's like a misconception,\n\n35:11.980 --> 35:16.980\n a stigma on psychedelics where it's like,\n\n35:17.340 --> 35:20.940\n it's a drug and it makes some people crazy.\n\n35:20.940 --> 35:22.140\n And then you're gonna be on the street\n\n35:22.140 --> 35:23.100\n and you're gonna be out of your mind\n\n35:23.100 --> 35:28.100\n or you're gonna become like a crazy person basically.\n\n35:28.980 --> 35:32.020\n And I think I really bought into that notion\n\n35:32.020 --> 35:33.340\n because again, I was raised,\n\n35:33.340 --> 35:34.700\n I wasn't even raised with cable TV.\n\n35:34.700 --> 35:35.540\n You know what I mean?\n\n35:35.540 --> 35:38.780\n Like ayahuasca is very, I didn't, you know.\n\n35:38.780 --> 35:40.740\n You can imagine what that was like for a Mormon kid.\n\n35:40.740 --> 35:41.620\n I didn't know anything about it\n\n35:41.620 --> 35:42.780\n and I never touched drugs at all\n\n35:42.780 --> 35:44.980\n and never even touched a cigarette, you know.\n\n35:47.180 --> 35:50.060\n Anyway, so I think we have this misconception about it\n\n35:50.060 --> 35:52.860\n where Americans are quick to go to their doctor\n\n35:52.860 --> 35:57.860\n and take any medication or drug,\n\n35:57.860 --> 36:02.860\n but you know, whoa, when it comes to like psychedelics.\n\n36:05.900 --> 36:08.500\n Anyway, that being said,\n\n36:08.500 --> 36:10.140\n so I had that trepidation going into it,\n\n36:10.140 --> 36:11.820\n but I really love and respect my wife\n\n36:11.820 --> 36:13.900\n and I saw it make a profound impact in her life\n\n36:13.900 --> 36:18.500\n where she suddenly was able to heal\n\n36:18.500 --> 36:19.780\n from a lot of trauma that she had.\n\n36:19.780 --> 36:22.740\n She had a really, she went through a lot in her life\n\n36:22.740 --> 36:24.460\n and it really helped her heal,\n\n36:24.460 --> 36:27.140\n but it also set her in a new path spiritually\n\n36:27.140 --> 36:32.140\n that seemed really like a place that I wanted to be.\n\n36:32.340 --> 36:35.580\n So I did it and I did it twice.\n\n36:35.580 --> 36:37.580\n The first time it didn't really have an effect on me,\n\n36:37.580 --> 36:40.700\n which happens to a lot of people, I guess.\n\n36:40.700 --> 36:42.460\n I drank this little thing\n\n36:42.460 --> 36:45.180\n and there was like this shaman who came over from overseas\n\n36:45.180 --> 36:50.180\n that was really, had been in the plant world for decades\n\n36:51.100 --> 36:53.220\n and was a really incredible,\n\n36:54.420 --> 36:57.420\n I don't even know if he likes to be called shaman, but.\n\n36:57.420 --> 37:00.300\n So it's supposed to be like 30, 60 minute to take effect\n\n37:00.300 --> 37:05.300\n and a few hours, the journey lasts.\n\n37:05.340 --> 37:07.540\n About four hours. Four hours.\n\n37:07.540 --> 37:08.740\n Yeah, so the second time I took it,\n\n37:08.740 --> 37:12.460\n I took it in, I would say 20, 30 minutes in exactly.\n\n37:12.460 --> 37:17.460\n I started to feel like I was like the dimension\n\n37:19.580 --> 37:23.900\n of what is reality, the curtain was pulled open\n\n37:23.900 --> 37:28.900\n and there was a lot more to discover\n\n37:29.980 --> 37:31.620\n and it really blew my mind in a way\n\n37:31.620 --> 37:34.540\n that I think it would probably blow anybody's mind\n\n37:34.540 --> 37:37.740\n if for instance, God descended or some Christian God\n\n37:37.740 --> 37:38.860\n or whatever it is.\n\n37:38.860 --> 37:40.220\n We all think it'd be this beautiful thing,\n\n37:40.220 --> 37:42.780\n but in reality, it would probably make people super fearful\n\n37:42.780 --> 37:45.220\n and think that they've lost their mind.\n\n37:45.220 --> 37:48.180\n Like I've always, yeah, I've always like joked\n\n37:48.180 --> 37:51.980\n that if the Mormon God came down and told my mom like,\n\n37:51.980 --> 37:53.940\n if God himself came down and told my mom,\n\n37:53.940 --> 37:57.140\n Mormonism is incorrect, she would say, Satan.\n\n37:57.140 --> 37:57.980\n Yeah.\n\n37:57.980 --> 37:59.380\n You know, it's like, we're never,\n\n37:59.380 --> 38:01.180\n I think our minds are just not prepared\n\n38:01.180 --> 38:05.860\n for a lot of anything that's really extreme\n\n38:05.860 --> 38:07.460\n and it was very extreme.\n\n38:07.460 --> 38:10.620\n It was like the curtain of life was cut open,\n\n38:10.620 --> 38:13.460\n which scared me, but then I felt very much\n\n38:13.460 --> 38:15.700\n and a lot of people that I've talked to\n\n38:15.700 --> 38:17.660\n have a similar thing where I felt very much\n\n38:17.660 --> 38:20.900\n like I was either communicating with something\n\n38:20.900 --> 38:23.660\n that was perceived as God to me\n\n38:23.660 --> 38:28.260\n or highest sense of self or mind or mother earth\n\n38:28.260 --> 38:29.860\n or you know, it's called so many different names,\n\n38:29.860 --> 38:33.580\n but it's really, it's very, a lot of people\n\n38:33.580 --> 38:37.660\n have a very spiritual, similar experience with ayahuasca.\n\n38:37.660 --> 38:40.260\n And just in that, it's like this kind of profoundness.\n\n38:40.260 --> 38:43.580\n It wasn't like, there was nothing at least for me\n\n38:43.580 --> 38:48.180\n that was, that felt like just like psychedelic,\n\n38:48.180 --> 38:49.780\n funny cartoons or something.\n\n38:49.780 --> 38:52.580\n It was like, I'm about to go on a journey\n\n38:52.580 --> 38:54.500\n and I'm gonna communicate,\n\n38:54.500 --> 38:58.260\n I'm communicating with something that feels incredibly wise,\n\n38:58.260 --> 39:00.820\n showed me a lot of things in my life,\n\n39:00.820 --> 39:02.300\n kind of almost like from a bird's eye,\n\n39:02.300 --> 39:03.940\n almost like I was looking through a video camera\n\n39:03.940 --> 39:05.940\n at a younger me.\n\n39:05.940 --> 39:08.700\n There was a particular thing that it communicated to me.\n\n39:11.820 --> 39:15.740\n I really have a hard time with accepting success\n\n39:15.740 --> 39:20.740\n and not feeling like feeling undeserving or something.\n\n39:21.380 --> 39:22.900\n I can't quite put it into words,\n\n39:22.900 --> 39:25.820\n but of my position and what I've been given,\n\n39:25.820 --> 39:28.420\n I've been given so much.\n\n39:30.620 --> 39:32.980\n And it showed me this thing from when I was young\n\n39:32.980 --> 39:35.060\n and explained to me why I am where I am now.\n\n39:35.060 --> 39:40.060\n And I, to this day, it did not feel like myself\n\n39:40.220 --> 39:41.220\n telling myself that.\n\n39:41.220 --> 39:42.980\n That's the only way I can explain it.\n\n39:42.980 --> 39:45.140\n And there was a lot more that it showed me\n\n39:45.140 --> 39:47.620\n and that was incredibly healing for me.\n\n39:47.620 --> 39:52.620\n But just to be like, to put it into a short thing\n\n39:52.620 --> 39:54.420\n because there's so much to this.\n\n39:55.940 --> 39:58.940\n It felt, I walked away feeling very convinced\n\n39:58.940 --> 40:03.940\n that there is more to be known, for sure.\n\n40:04.180 --> 40:09.180\n And a lot of my deep things that were traumatic for me\n\n40:10.420 --> 40:12.620\n didn't feel traumatic anymore,\n\n40:12.620 --> 40:14.420\n specifically crisis of faith.\n\n40:14.420 --> 40:19.140\n I was very angry at my parents and my community\n\n40:19.140 --> 40:24.140\n for raising me in what I perceived to be falsehoods.\n\n40:25.780 --> 40:30.780\n And that, I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed\n\n40:30.820 --> 40:32.540\n was ripped out for me in my 20s.\n\n40:32.540 --> 40:35.420\n And then it was like, good luck in life.\n\n40:35.420 --> 40:37.380\n But really my parents had given me everything\n\n40:37.380 --> 40:38.220\n that they could.\n\n40:38.220 --> 40:41.740\n And they believed that very much so, still.\n\n40:41.740 --> 40:44.500\n But a naive young me was angry\n\n40:44.500 --> 40:46.860\n and felt like they had been duped\n\n40:46.860 --> 40:49.340\n and thus I had been duped.\n\n40:49.340 --> 40:53.860\n But Ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like,\n\n40:53.860 --> 40:56.260\n this is truth and you're concerning yourself\n\n40:56.260 --> 40:59.780\n about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever it is.\n\n40:59.780 --> 41:02.740\n And there may be some truths in that tiny grain of sand\n\n41:02.740 --> 41:04.540\n and there may be falsities.\n\n41:04.540 --> 41:06.140\n But so is all these other grains of sand,\n\n41:06.140 --> 41:07.820\n like focus on the truth.\n\n41:07.820 --> 41:10.580\n Stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless\n\n41:10.580 --> 41:13.460\n and forgive and let go of people believing\n\n41:13.460 --> 41:15.540\n in those things to begin with.\n\n41:15.540 --> 41:17.300\n I don't know if that makes sense,\n\n41:17.300 --> 41:20.260\n but that was like the core thing I was taught\n\n41:20.260 --> 41:24.260\n and to let go of control, stop needing to control everything.\n\n41:24.260 --> 41:26.660\n And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere.\n\n41:26.660 --> 41:30.180\n Like it's really, I do not believe,\n\n41:30.180 --> 41:33.020\n at least in my current self, I don't have that,\n\n41:33.020 --> 41:37.020\n the mindfulness that I believe that exists in me\n\n41:37.020 --> 41:39.140\n to reach a lot of the conclusions that I did.\n\n41:39.140 --> 41:41.020\n And there was a lot more to it\n\n41:41.020 --> 41:43.340\n that would be for like a late night conversation with you.\n\n41:43.340 --> 41:46.180\n But it's so hard to put it into,\n\n41:47.540 --> 41:48.820\n you feel like a crazy person.\n\n41:48.820 --> 41:50.860\n Any, at least anytime I talk about ayahuasca\n\n41:50.860 --> 41:51.780\n to someone who hasn't done it,\n\n41:51.780 --> 41:53.300\n I'm like, I don't even know where to begin.\n\n41:53.300 --> 41:55.580\n Like, how do you explain to someone\n\n41:55.580 --> 41:59.740\n that you felt like that a multiple dimension type thing\n\n41:59.740 --> 42:03.180\n happened in a way that like putting it into words is,\n\n42:03.180 --> 42:04.580\n and none of it was words, by the way,\n\n42:04.580 --> 42:05.860\n that was communicated to me.\n\n42:05.860 --> 42:09.900\n It was like, you know how people talk about telepathy.\n\n42:09.900 --> 42:12.140\n And if it existed, it would be like,\n\n42:12.140 --> 42:14.140\n I could communicate to you in such a deeper way.\n\n42:14.140 --> 42:16.980\n I'm so confined by me having to articulate these words\n\n42:16.980 --> 42:18.540\n and put them in a sentence to you, Lex,\n\n42:18.540 --> 42:21.460\n and then tell you like, if only I could just be like,\n\n42:23.060 --> 42:24.540\n and emotions do that sometimes, right?\n\n42:24.540 --> 42:26.540\n You could see my emotions and be like,\n\n42:26.540 --> 42:28.380\n oh, that communicates a lot.\n\n42:28.380 --> 42:30.780\n So that's what it felt like to me with ayahuasca\n\n42:30.780 --> 42:34.380\n is it felt like it was communicating to me very clear things,\n\n42:34.380 --> 42:38.540\n but it wasn't like, Daniel, it's me, Mother Earth.\n\n42:38.540 --> 42:41.300\n Let me relax, sit back, let me show you.\n\n42:41.300 --> 42:44.500\n But it was very clear to me what was being said.\n\n42:44.500 --> 42:46.660\n And no, it did not feel like me,\n\n42:46.660 --> 42:50.060\n but maybe smarter people than me who've done it would say,\n\n42:50.060 --> 42:51.620\n well, it was you and blah, blah, blah.\n\n42:51.620 --> 42:53.500\n I don't know, but it was very convincing.\n\n42:53.500 --> 42:55.660\n There's a lot of stuff in that subconscious\n\n42:55.660 --> 42:59.300\n that we haven't explored.\n\n42:59.300 --> 43:01.580\n Like we haven't explored the depths of the ocean.\n\n43:01.580 --> 43:03.580\n We haven't really figured out what's that,\n\n43:03.580 --> 43:06.300\n the younging shadow, what's going on underneath\n\n43:06.300 --> 43:08.620\n the surface of our conscious mind.\n\n43:08.620 --> 43:10.380\n And what is that connecting to?\n\n43:10.380 --> 43:13.500\n Is that just inside our mind or is it some kind of,\n\n43:13.500 --> 43:15.820\n is there some kind of collective intelligence going on\n\n43:15.820 --> 43:16.940\n where all humans are connected\n\n43:16.940 --> 43:20.900\n to one kind of greater organism?\n\n43:20.900 --> 43:22.500\n Like what is consciousness?\n\n43:22.500 --> 43:25.620\n We have a lot of hubris in thinking we understand\n\n43:25.620 --> 43:28.620\n any of it, like how the mind works at all.\n\n43:28.620 --> 43:32.140\n Like what is it, like where,\n\n43:32.140 --> 43:34.900\n what is the origin of consciousness?\n\n43:34.900 --> 43:37.460\n What is the origin of intelligence?\n\n43:37.460 --> 43:39.100\n There's a lot of hubris about this.\n\n43:39.100 --> 43:43.180\n We give each other PhDs and Nobel prizes\n\n43:43.180 --> 43:46.820\n and congratulate ourselves as if we figured it all out.\n\n43:46.820 --> 43:48.740\n But humility is helpful here.\n\n43:48.740 --> 43:50.300\n Nevertheless, that is the question\n\n43:50.300 --> 43:51.980\n that humans have been asking for\n\n43:53.740 --> 43:56.700\n ever since humans were humans,\n\n43:56.700 --> 43:59.900\n which is the question of mortality, the question of God.\n\n44:02.460 --> 44:05.980\n So whether it's Hamlet to be or not to be,\n\n44:05.980 --> 44:08.660\n I think that's the hardest, the most important question.\n\n44:08.660 --> 44:12.980\n Albert Camus asked, why live?\n\n44:17.020 --> 44:18.740\n So in terms of crisis of faith,\n\n44:18.740 --> 44:20.060\n in terms of your search for truth,\n\n44:20.060 --> 44:21.580\n in terms of some of the dark places\n\n44:21.580 --> 44:23.220\n you've gone in your mind,\n\n44:23.220 --> 44:25.180\n what's a good answer to this question?\n\n44:27.020 --> 44:29.580\n So for Camus with Mithos Sisyphus,\n\n44:29.580 --> 44:32.780\n it was the question of suicide.\n\n44:33.780 --> 44:36.540\n Is, what's the purpose?\n\n44:36.540 --> 44:40.780\n Like, what's a good answer to why keep going,\n\n44:40.780 --> 44:42.500\n especially when you're struggling,\n\n44:42.500 --> 44:44.020\n especially when you're not,\n\n44:47.180 --> 44:48.940\n when you're feeling hopeless,\n\n44:50.060 --> 44:54.900\n when you're feeling like a burden in this search for truth,\n\n44:54.900 --> 44:57.340\n where you feel like you're surrounded by lies,\n\n44:57.340 --> 44:58.980\n what's a good answer to why live?\n\n45:00.580 --> 45:02.540\n You ever found one?\n\n45:02.540 --> 45:06.340\n Well, the simple answer right now is to say for,\n\n45:06.340 --> 45:09.140\n it's very easy once you have kids to say,\n\n45:09.140 --> 45:10.540\n the right answer is you just,\n\n45:10.540 --> 45:13.460\n of course you brought these kids into the world,\n\n45:13.460 --> 45:17.220\n so you have a responsibility that I feel deeply as a father\n\n45:17.220 --> 45:21.540\n to them to always be there for as long as I humanly can\n\n45:21.540 --> 45:23.140\n and to take care of them and protect them.\n\n45:23.140 --> 45:26.380\n It's the most innate sense in me,\n\n45:26.380 --> 45:31.380\n just, it's wired in my animal existence.\n\n45:31.380 --> 45:33.740\n So if I take that away, right,\n\n45:33.740 --> 45:35.100\n because that's kind of cheating.\n\n45:35.100 --> 45:37.220\n Let's put that aside because it is cheating.\n\n45:37.220 --> 45:38.060\n It's cheating.\n\n45:38.060 --> 45:41.780\n There's still some fundamental way in which you're alone.\n\n45:41.780 --> 45:42.740\n Yeah.\n\n45:42.740 --> 45:47.740\n And to that, that actually has been a real struggle for me\n\n45:48.020 --> 45:49.060\n for many years.\n\n45:49.060 --> 45:52.020\n I had a real turning point early in my career\n\n45:52.020 --> 45:57.020\n where we were flying somewhere overseas\n\n45:57.020 --> 46:02.020\n and we were in a really small plane\n\n46:02.020 --> 46:04.340\n and the lights went out\n\n46:04.340 --> 46:06.460\n and like all these red lights were flashing\n\n46:06.460 --> 46:08.980\n and the plane just started to dive.\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:13.420\n Completely like scariest plane experience I've ever been in.\n\n46:13.420 --> 46:16.060\n My manager was next to me, who's my brother.\n\n46:16.060 --> 46:20.540\n He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye.\n\n46:20.540 --> 46:23.260\n That's how like crazy this moment was.\n\n46:23.260 --> 46:24.700\n Was it real like genuine?\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:29.700\n Like genuine engine went out, plane is going down,\n\n46:30.140 --> 46:33.700\n pilots looking like crazy in the front\n\n46:33.700 --> 46:35.300\n and it was a really tiny jet.\n\n46:36.420 --> 46:39.460\n And like I said, my brother next to me crying,\n\n46:39.460 --> 46:40.780\n typing a text to his wife.\n\n46:40.780 --> 46:41.980\n Really, really scary.\n\n46:42.860 --> 46:45.660\n And I felt nothing.\n\n46:45.660 --> 46:48.620\n I genuinely sat there and I was like,\n\n46:50.740 --> 46:52.620\n this might actually be nice.\n\n46:52.620 --> 46:56.740\n Like I really felt like this goes down\n\n46:56.740 --> 47:00.820\n and like, ah man, life sucks and it's hard.\n\n47:00.820 --> 47:02.900\n And that sounds so ridiculous I know to say\n\n47:02.900 --> 47:05.580\n because again, I'm in a different place now\n\n47:05.580 --> 47:07.260\n and I see my life for what it is.\n\n47:07.260 --> 47:09.300\n But at that moment I did not.\n\n47:09.300 --> 47:11.620\n So life was primarily defined by suffering,\n\n47:11.620 --> 47:12.460\n it was a burden.\n\n47:12.460 --> 47:16.180\n It was, I felt I was incredibly depressed.\n\n47:16.180 --> 47:20.740\n I had been trying different medications since I was young\n\n47:20.740 --> 47:24.460\n and I just had not found anything that was working for me.\n\n47:24.460 --> 47:27.660\n And then I was in a faith crisis, lost all my faith,\n\n47:29.020 --> 47:31.420\n started a band that's just became,\n\n47:31.420 --> 47:33.620\n I wasn't ever thinking that this band.\n\n47:33.620 --> 47:35.940\n I was like, when you call your band Imagine Dragons,\n\n47:35.940 --> 47:38.500\n you're not thinking that band's gonna be big, okay?\n\n47:38.500 --> 47:41.180\n It was like, I was like,\n\n47:41.180 --> 47:43.780\n this was like a side project that was fun for me.\n\n47:43.780 --> 47:45.780\n It was like art in college.\n\n47:45.780 --> 47:47.500\n I was in school and I was like,\n\n47:47.500 --> 47:49.020\n man, I hate this biology class.\n\n47:49.020 --> 47:50.340\n I'm gonna write down band names.\n\n47:50.340 --> 47:51.180\n Like, you know what I mean?\n\n47:51.180 --> 47:55.100\n Like it was not, hey, put everything aside,\n\n47:55.100 --> 47:56.900\n this is my career, let's go.\n\n47:56.900 --> 48:00.260\n Like it just, it happened.\n\n48:00.260 --> 48:03.100\n And I'm an introvert by nature.\n\n48:03.100 --> 48:05.060\n I'm really not an extroverted person\n\n48:05.060 --> 48:06.780\n who likes to go out and like,\n\n48:07.780 --> 48:09.780\n I like to be at home with a couple of friends\n\n48:09.780 --> 48:12.420\n and have a late night conversation over good food.\n\n48:12.420 --> 48:14.220\n Like that to me is a perfect night.\n\n48:14.220 --> 48:17.480\n Read a good book, listen to a podcast, go on a walk.\n\n48:17.480 --> 48:21.520\n You know, those are things that I really, really enjoy.\n\n48:21.520 --> 48:23.080\n And suddenly I'm in this life where I'm like\n\n48:23.080 --> 48:26.840\n supposed to be something that I really don't wanna be.\n\n48:26.840 --> 48:29.280\n Except for on stage, which is a really fast,\n\n48:29.280 --> 48:31.040\n like strange thing to me, which is on stage,\n\n48:31.040 --> 48:35.840\n I feel so free and exuberant and like an extrovert.\n\n48:35.840 --> 48:37.480\n And then I come off and I just feel like\n\n48:37.480 --> 48:38.800\n shrivel back into a shell.\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:41.680\n Like it's, music does that for me\n\n48:41.680 --> 48:43.480\n and performing on a stage does that for me.\n\n48:43.480 --> 48:44.840\n Can we take a small tangent on that?\n\n48:44.840 --> 48:45.680\n Yeah, yeah, of course.\n\n48:45.680 --> 48:47.000\n What's the high,\n\n48:47.000 --> 48:49.480\n can we go through that the introvert\n\n48:49.480 --> 48:52.440\n that wants to cuddle up and read a book?\n\n48:52.440 --> 48:54.400\n You're the front man of one of the,\n\n48:54.400 --> 48:59.160\n if not the biggest rock bands today,\n\n48:59.160 --> 49:01.180\n playing in front of huge crowds.\n\n49:02.960 --> 49:06.920\n What's the high of that and how can you land back on Earth?\n\n49:10.140 --> 49:11.360\n The high of it,\n\n49:11.360 --> 49:15.880\n it's incredibly beautiful\n\n49:15.880 --> 49:19.120\n to walk on a stage,\n\n49:19.120 --> 49:21.800\n sing these songs that you wrote\n\n49:22.740 --> 49:25.580\n and see it resonate with people around you\n\n49:25.580 --> 49:27.320\n and sing with them.\n\n49:27.320 --> 49:29.600\n Different cultures, different places,\n\n49:29.600 --> 49:30.720\n celebrate life.\n\n49:30.720 --> 49:34.120\n It's suddenly the world seems like a fantastic place.\n\n49:34.120 --> 49:37.400\n It feels like we're all on the same team.\n\n49:37.400 --> 49:38.660\n It's like one big hug.\n\n49:38.660 --> 49:40.820\n Yeah, it's like everybody in that room gets it\n\n49:40.820 --> 49:43.720\n and they all, like it just,\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:47.840\n it feels like what you want the world to be,\n\n49:47.840 --> 49:50.640\n which is just like this coexisting unit of people\n\n49:50.640 --> 49:52.100\n and it's not even about like,\n\n49:54.280 --> 49:56.600\n it's incredible, for sure, it's incredible\n\n49:56.600 --> 49:59.760\n and I love it and I wouldn't do it unless I loved it.\n\n49:59.760 --> 50:01.600\n And then you walk off stage and you turn on the news\n\n50:01.600 --> 50:04.480\n and it's like, you see, we're all against each other,\n\n50:04.480 --> 50:05.520\n everybody hates each other\n\n50:05.520 --> 50:07.340\n and it feels that way in the world.\n\n50:07.340 --> 50:11.160\n So music really, that's why live music is so important\n\n50:11.160 --> 50:13.880\n to people, that's why music is so important to people.\n\n50:13.880 --> 50:15.520\n Because even if it's just you and that person\n\n50:15.520 --> 50:16.960\n that wrote the song, you're listening to it\n\n50:16.960 --> 50:18.740\n and the two of you feel connected.\n\n50:19.640 --> 50:23.060\n You know, it's like you're hearing Tracy Chapman\n\n50:23.060 --> 50:24.800\n sing like Fast Car or something,\n\n50:24.800 --> 50:27.900\n you're just like, oh my gosh, like yes, I get it.\n\n50:27.900 --> 50:31.360\n And you feel connected to that person, you don't feel alone.\n\n50:31.360 --> 50:33.080\n So that's the high of it, for sure.\n\n50:33.080 --> 50:36.280\n And then you get off stage and then, you know,\n\n50:36.280 --> 50:39.320\n as my, like my uncle is a heart surgeon,\n\n50:39.320 --> 50:42.720\n incredible heart surgeon who like writes the book.\n\n50:42.720 --> 50:45.200\n Like he's like the guy that the heart surgeons talk to,\n\n50:45.200 --> 50:46.360\n he's out of Nashville, Tennessee,\n\n50:46.360 --> 50:48.600\n he's just an incredible genius man.\n\n50:48.600 --> 50:53.600\n He always worries and always reached out to me.\n\n50:53.840 --> 50:55.800\n He's like, musicians die all the time\n\n50:55.800 --> 50:58.120\n and the reason they die, you know,\n\n50:58.120 --> 50:59.240\n is because you're getting on stage\n\n50:59.240 --> 51:00.080\n and your heart's doing this\n\n51:00.080 --> 51:01.280\n and your cortisol levels are doing this,\n\n51:01.280 --> 51:03.520\n you're getting off stage and then you're just doing this.\n\n51:03.520 --> 51:05.040\n And it's a really real thing.\n\n51:05.040 --> 51:07.600\n Like you get off stage and you feel like you need drugs\n\n51:07.600 --> 51:11.240\n because you're like, the world feels like,\n\n51:11.240 --> 51:12.960\n oh, incredibly daunting.\n\n51:12.960 --> 51:15.280\n And it's also, I'm sure, has to do with like\n\n51:15.280 --> 51:17.640\n some like health things in your heart\n\n51:17.640 --> 51:19.960\n and the cortisol levels that are so crazy\n\n51:19.960 --> 51:21.760\n and then you come off and it's like,\n\n51:22.840 --> 51:25.160\n I know people are like, well, then nothing's enough,\n\n51:25.160 --> 51:27.120\n except meth, you know what I mean, right?\n\n51:27.120 --> 51:28.940\n Nothing's enough except heroin.\n\n51:28.940 --> 51:30.880\n And that's why a lot of artists turn to that stuff.\n\n51:30.880 --> 51:33.440\n And I don't say it in a preachy way,\n\n51:33.440 --> 51:36.280\n like I've struggled with drug abuse in my life.\n\n51:36.280 --> 51:41.280\n And I really, I understand why artists turn to it.\n\n51:43.400 --> 51:46.540\n But also the fact that you're an introvert.\n\n51:46.540 --> 51:49.540\n So the other side of it, the fame.\n\n51:50.400 --> 51:51.800\n That's something that you also said\n\n51:51.800 --> 51:53.560\n is a double edged sword for you.\n\n51:53.560 --> 51:55.960\n The interesting thing about fame,\n\n51:55.960 --> 51:57.080\n is that you also mentioned,\n\n51:57.080 --> 51:59.680\n is it something you can't take back?\n\n51:59.680 --> 52:00.520\n Yeah.\n\n52:00.520 --> 52:04.080\n It's the thing, you can't just like go on vacation\n\n52:04.080 --> 52:06.300\n in Hawaii and it's like, consider, do I like it or not?\n\n52:06.300 --> 52:08.600\n No, you're staying in Hawaii for the rest of your life\n\n52:08.600 --> 52:10.840\n and you've never been there before,\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:12.600\n whether you like it or not.\n\n52:12.600 --> 52:17.600\n So what's that like being loved by millions\n\n52:18.860 --> 52:20.640\n and millions and millions of people,\n\n52:22.280 --> 52:26.320\n which is perhaps the best kind of fame\n\n52:26.320 --> 52:28.360\n in terms of if you have to choose the kinds of fame\n\n52:28.360 --> 52:29.520\n that there are.\n\n52:29.520 --> 52:32.720\n And still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff.\n\n52:32.720 --> 52:37.480\n So what, do you feel alone?\n\n52:37.480 --> 52:40.200\n More alone being famous?\n\n52:40.200 --> 52:41.520\n Is there a loneliness to it?\n\n52:41.520 --> 52:44.720\n Yeah, I mean, it's such a funny thing.\n\n52:44.720 --> 52:45.540\n Okay, if you had asked,\n\n52:45.540 --> 52:47.360\n if we were having this conversation a couple of years ago,\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:49.080\n I'd be incredibly guarded about this\n\n52:49.080 --> 52:54.080\n because the last thing I wanna ever do\n\n52:54.200 --> 52:58.620\n is sound ungrateful or unaware of how much I have\n\n52:58.620 --> 53:02.000\n and woe is the famous celebrity with money.\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:03.040\n Oh, is your life hard?\n\n53:03.040 --> 53:05.380\n Is it really telling me about how hard it is?\n\n53:05.380 --> 53:06.640\n But I'm also at a place in life now\n\n53:06.640 --> 53:08.720\n where I just like, I'm gonna always just speak my truth\n\n53:08.720 --> 53:10.120\n because that's the only reason I'm here\n\n53:10.120 --> 53:11.600\n is I'm here to speak my truth to you.\n\n53:11.600 --> 53:12.600\n So I'm gonna tell you my truth,\n\n53:12.600 --> 53:14.440\n whether it's whatever it is.\n\n53:14.440 --> 53:17.520\n But you're human and feelings are real.\n\n53:17.520 --> 53:20.040\n And so, and that's the interesting thing.\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:22.360\n You win a lottery, what's that gonna feel like?\n\n53:22.360 --> 53:25.080\n It's not about complaining, oh, it's so hard to win a lottery\n\n53:25.080 --> 53:25.960\n because you get a lot of money.\n\n53:25.960 --> 53:27.960\n No, it's still, you're human.\n\n53:27.960 --> 53:30.760\n You get to experience these feelings and it's fascinating.\n\n53:30.760 --> 53:33.200\n You put humans in different situations.\n\n53:33.200 --> 53:35.680\n And it's also fascinating because a lot of people think,\n\n53:35.680 --> 53:38.080\n well, I would like to be famous.\n\n53:38.080 --> 53:40.440\n That's a big thing now on social media and Instagram\n\n53:40.440 --> 53:41.280\n and so on.\n\n53:41.280 --> 53:42.120\n The whole world wants to be famous.\n\n53:42.120 --> 53:43.340\n Or rich or famous.\n\n53:43.340 --> 53:45.200\n And then it's very interesting to think, all right,\n\n53:45.200 --> 53:49.680\n well, once you arrive, are all the problems solved?\n\n53:49.680 --> 53:50.520\n No, yeah.\n\n53:50.520 --> 53:52.480\n So I will tell you, according to me,\n\n53:52.480 --> 53:54.760\n what the pitfalls are, whether it's true or not.\n\n53:54.760 --> 53:56.280\n And there are certainly some pitfalls.\n\n53:56.280 --> 53:58.960\n One, it's once you're there, you can't go back.\n\n54:00.080 --> 54:01.360\n Whatever, maybe that's fine.\n\n54:01.360 --> 54:02.960\n Cause maybe you love it.\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:07.960\n But the real pitfall for me is that you're now you're Lex\n\n54:09.900 --> 54:13.360\n and you're what everybody's perception is that Lex is.\n\n54:13.360 --> 54:15.280\n And that's what you are.\n\n54:15.280 --> 54:20.120\n Now Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated\n\n54:20.120 --> 54:23.600\n and has a lot more to Lex than the Lex\n\n54:23.600 --> 54:24.880\n that is the celebrity.\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:29.880\n So, but anybody who meets you, that's who you are to them.\n\n54:32.680 --> 54:35.280\n And you may, you may not feel this way,\n\n54:35.280 --> 54:37.760\n but you may feel confined to actually have to be that person\n\n54:37.760 --> 54:39.280\n to that person.\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:41.800\n Like I've early in my career for a long time,\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:44.320\n anytime I met someone, I suddenly felt like I had to be\n\n54:44.320 --> 54:46.400\n Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.\n\n54:46.400 --> 54:48.800\n Anytime I met someone, including my family now,\n\n54:48.800 --> 54:50.600\n who are also like, whoa, this is crazy.\n\n54:50.600 --> 54:52.920\n You're like Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.\n\n54:52.920 --> 54:55.560\n And I wanted to just be the goofball\n\n54:55.560 --> 54:58.680\n that I have been my whole life with my brothers and family.\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:00.720\n But suddenly I found myself feeling like,\n\n55:00.720 --> 55:02.720\n no, I have to be this.\n\n55:02.720 --> 55:05.240\n Like, cause that's who, that's who this is.\n\n55:05.240 --> 55:06.720\n So you're almost like playing a role.\n\n55:06.720 --> 55:08.760\n And it's like, I've heard a lot of actors talk about this\n\n55:08.760 --> 55:10.320\n where they'll take on a role and then it's like,\n\n55:10.320 --> 55:12.480\n they feel like they have to, they like become that.\n\n55:12.480 --> 55:14.720\n And it's a really scary thing.\n\n55:14.720 --> 55:17.720\n Like you alter who you are almost\n\n55:17.720 --> 55:19.960\n to fit the notion of other people.\n\n55:19.960 --> 55:23.520\n Cause especially if a lot of artists are empaths,\n\n55:24.520 --> 55:26.360\n it, you know, a lot of people get into art\n\n55:26.360 --> 55:27.560\n in a deep way are empaths.\n\n55:27.560 --> 55:31.240\n And so you feel a lot of what people are feeling\n\n55:31.240 --> 55:33.320\n and you're never wanting to burden people.\n\n55:33.320 --> 55:36.680\n And you're always wanting to deliver to that person,\n\n55:36.680 --> 55:39.240\n you know, what they want is like people pleasing is very,\n\n55:39.240 --> 55:42.960\n goes hand in hand with a lot of like these famous people.\n\n55:42.960 --> 55:44.200\n And they get to where they were\n\n55:44.200 --> 55:45.880\n because they know how to do that.\n\n55:45.880 --> 55:47.080\n They know how to be in a room with someone\n\n55:47.080 --> 55:49.200\n and look them in the eye and make them feel\n\n55:49.200 --> 55:51.080\n like they're the only person in the room.\n\n55:51.080 --> 55:52.960\n And then now they got that role in that movie\n\n55:52.960 --> 55:54.720\n because they sat with the casting director\n\n55:54.720 --> 55:57.480\n and they were like, oh, you're so funny.\n\n55:57.480 --> 55:59.520\n Oh, has anybody told, like put on the charisma,\n\n55:59.520 --> 56:00.360\n do it all.\n\n56:00.360 --> 56:02.400\n And it's like, anyway, I'm like,\n\n56:02.400 --> 56:03.920\n I'm going on a different tangent here,\n\n56:03.920 --> 56:07.160\n but long story short, there's a lot of things\n\n56:07.160 --> 56:08.720\n that are really unhealthy about it.\n\n56:08.720 --> 56:11.240\n And then a lot of people who want the fame,\n\n56:11.240 --> 56:12.760\n then the second it starts to go away,\n\n56:12.760 --> 56:14.840\n then they're like, who am I anymore?\n\n56:14.840 --> 56:16.080\n Like that was everything.\n\n56:16.080 --> 56:17.360\n And now I'm like on the down\n\n56:17.360 --> 56:19.240\n and now I'm not a famous person anymore.\n\n56:19.240 --> 56:21.720\n And now I hate myself and I'm going to do drugs.\n\n56:21.720 --> 56:24.040\n And it's like, it's like this vicious cycle,\n\n56:24.040 --> 56:25.800\n like you could never be famous enough.\n\n56:25.800 --> 56:27.800\n You're always going to get like,\n\n56:27.800 --> 56:29.680\n there's just so much to it that I've just,\n\n56:29.680 --> 56:33.200\n and again, like I've lost friends\n\n56:33.200 --> 56:35.880\n in this career to do that for sure.\n\n56:36.960 --> 56:38.800\n And there's a certain element to sort of just\n\n56:38.800 --> 56:42.920\n on the losing fame of interacting with a lot of folks,\n\n56:44.880 --> 56:46.880\n especially young folks like on YouTube.\n\n56:46.880 --> 56:51.000\n So fame is a thing that has levels.\n\n56:51.000 --> 56:52.920\n You're always trying to be a little more famous.\n\n56:52.920 --> 56:54.320\n A lot of folks who are chasing fame,\n\n56:54.320 --> 56:55.160\n it doesn't matter how famous you are,\n\n56:55.160 --> 56:56.680\n you're always trying to chase more.\n\n56:56.680 --> 56:58.440\n And when you start to lose it,\n\n56:58.440 --> 57:01.080\n interesting things can happen if you're not self aware,\n\n57:01.080 --> 57:03.920\n which is like, like you mentioned,\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:08.840\n you might be trying to grasp back at where you were\n\n57:08.840 --> 57:11.440\n by leaning into the formula that got you there.\n\n57:11.440 --> 57:15.600\n And so the constraints of the image that you mentioned\n\n57:15.600 --> 57:19.560\n becomes the thing that you're now trying to lean into.\n\n57:19.560 --> 57:22.600\n And that's actually walking away from who you really are.\n\n57:22.600 --> 57:25.840\n Like you lean further into being that person.\n\n57:25.840 --> 57:26.840\n That's true for acting.\n\n57:26.840 --> 57:30.240\n That's true for even on like YouTube,\n\n57:30.240 --> 57:32.440\n which is people acting, they have a role.\n\n57:32.440 --> 57:34.600\n They got them to the table somehow.\n\n57:34.600 --> 57:37.680\n Yeah, it's dark, but I think those are,\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:43.920\n that's just put for everybody to see,\n\n57:43.920 --> 57:47.120\n but that's a very human struggle even when you're not famous.\n\n57:47.120 --> 57:49.280\n Finding yourself, being yourself,\n\n57:49.280 --> 57:54.280\n of not letting, not doing the people pleasing at any scale\n\n57:55.160 --> 57:56.280\n and being trapped by that.\n\n57:56.280 --> 57:58.920\n Yeah, and also feeling like it's never enough.\n\n57:58.920 --> 58:03.120\n I think that's something all, like it's not just\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:04.560\n a famous thing, but it's like in the whole,\n\n58:04.560 --> 58:06.360\n like everybody deals with feeling like\n\n58:06.360 --> 58:08.640\n when I'm here, I'll be happy.\n\n58:08.640 --> 58:10.080\n When I get that job, I'll be happy.\n\n58:10.080 --> 58:12.760\n When I have that money, then I'll be happy.\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:16.000\n When I get that surgery and my nose looks like this,\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:17.240\n I will be happy then.\n\n58:17.240 --> 58:22.240\n It's like a constant chase of happiness instead of happiness.\n\n58:25.280 --> 58:27.640\n It's like the opposite, it's opposite of self love.\n\n58:27.640 --> 58:29.480\n It's the opposite of happiness.\n\n58:30.640 --> 58:31.920\n There's no presence to it.\n\n58:31.920 --> 58:34.200\n You're constant, you're never going to find it.\n\n58:34.200 --> 58:36.560\n You're never gonna arrive and you're just gonna\n\n58:36.560 --> 58:38.240\n live your life and then you're gonna be on your death bed\n\n58:38.240 --> 58:43.240\n and be like, I was chasing the wrong thing my whole life.\n\n58:43.600 --> 58:46.280\n I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way.\n\n58:46.280 --> 58:49.280\n So for me personally, because you just talk a lot,\n\n58:49.280 --> 58:52.720\n you can't, people that meet you, they know you\n\n58:52.720 --> 58:54.920\n and they know the evolution of you.\n\n58:54.920 --> 58:58.760\n And that's the same thing for like you right now,\n\n58:58.760 --> 59:02.000\n Dan of Imagine Dragons, just being on a podcast\n\n59:02.000 --> 59:07.000\n like long form reveals a side that liberates you more\n\n59:07.000 --> 59:12.000\n to be yourself, to like, people see, oh, there's a human.\n\n59:12.200 --> 59:15.560\n They, cause they, music, they have a deep connection\n\n59:15.560 --> 59:18.520\n with you, they have experiences with you\n\n59:18.520 --> 59:21.240\n the way they experienced it and that's who you are\n\n59:21.240 --> 59:22.800\n with them through the songs.\n\n59:22.800 --> 59:26.080\n But now you get to see, oh, that's a human being.\n\n59:26.080 --> 59:29.360\n He probably gets angry, he gets sad, he's excited,\n\n59:29.360 --> 59:33.240\n he's hopeful and there's a core, there's a good human being\n\n59:33.240 --> 59:36.240\n with the whole roller coaster of emotions all there.\n\n59:36.240 --> 59:37.560\n It's a giant, beautiful mess.\n\n59:37.560 --> 59:39.920\n And podcasts reveal that, that's why I love podcasts\n\n59:39.920 --> 59:44.400\n like long form, you get to hear some artists and actors\n\n59:44.400 --> 59:47.480\n and so on and some of them you get to see, oh,\n\n59:47.480 --> 59:52.480\n you've lost yourself in the surface.\n\n59:53.920 --> 59:57.200\n That's a tragedy with some actors, some great actors.\n\n59:57.200 --> 1:00:01.200\n They've left so much of themselves in the roles\n\n1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:06.000\n they've played that they can no longer be the thing\n\n1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.400\n they were before, those great roles.\n\n1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:11.760\n That's for sure, it's hard, it's hard to see.\n\n1:00:11.760 --> 1:00:13.480\n So you get to see that with Johnny Depp with,\n\n1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:15.200\n I don't know, Pirates, he was talking about that\n\n1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:18.760\n with Pirates of the Caribbean, that was a shift.\n\n1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:23.760\n Like he's not that guy, he's forever, forever that guy.\n\n1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:27.440\n But the point is to remember that you're not\n\n1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:29.120\n into your family, which is interesting you said\n\n1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:31.600\n with your family, when I see people close to me,\n\n1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:34.860\n they also, there is an element like that\n\n1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:37.400\n while you're that, they start treating you\n\n1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:38.840\n like the famous person.\n\n1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:43.840\n Yeah, I'm fortunate to have my manager who's my brother,\n\n1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:47.820\n my older brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother.\n\n1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:53.640\n And that's been helpful because it's weird,\n\n1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:55.400\n it gets weird with everyone no matter what.\n\n1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:59.440\n One of the best advice I was given was by Charlie Sheen.\n\n1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:00.560\n You got advice from Charlie Sheen.\n\n1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:02.160\n Yeah, we were playing.\n\n1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:04.160\n The wise sage of our generation.\n\n1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:07.760\n Wise sage Charlie Sheen, but it was, it was really wise.\n\n1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:11.320\n I was sitting next to him and we were playing\n\n1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.220\n some late night television and he said,\n\n1:01:13.220 --> 1:01:14.940\n this was right at the beginning, and he just said,\n\n1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:18.800\n boys, just mark my words, your life is about\n\n1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:21.220\n to get really weird, that's all he said.\n\n1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:22.840\n But it stuck with me forever and it's Charlie Sheen,\n\n1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:25.060\n so of course it sticks with you.\n\n1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:27.280\n And I remember being like, right, okay, Charlie Sheen,\n\n1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:29.100\n I'm not Charlie Sheen, it's not gonna get weird,\n\n1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:29.940\n like, you know.\n\n1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:34.440\n But it got really, really weird, really quick,\n\n1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:37.640\n because suddenly you've existed your whole life\n\n1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.920\n in this way where everybody just,\n\n1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:42.440\n everything you get, you achieved,\n\n1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:44.520\n it was because you got it.\n\n1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.220\n And every conversation you had, like,\n\n1:01:47.220 --> 1:01:49.640\n if someone liked you at the end of that conversation,\n\n1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:51.080\n well, it's because they liked you.\n\n1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:53.580\n If they didn't like you, it's because they didn't like you.\n\n1:01:53.580 --> 1:01:55.280\n And you can make complete peace with that.\n\n1:01:55.280 --> 1:01:56.520\n At least I could my whole life.\n\n1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.640\n I was like, life is a challenge.\n\n1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:01.920\n And be myself and I'm gonna go through it\n\n1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:04.280\n and find some people along the way that I connect with\n\n1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:05.200\n and others, no.\n\n1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.200\n And that social integrity is so important to us.\n\n1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.880\n And we think it would be nice to have this,\n\n1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:16.260\n and this is going back to the pitfalls of fame.\n\n1:02:16.260 --> 1:02:18.940\n We think it would be nice to walk into a room\n\n1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:20.340\n and have everyone be like,\n\n1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.960\n and you could be like, dumpster fire.\n\n1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:26.800\n And everybody's like, oh my gosh, dumpster fire,\n\n1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:28.040\n that was amazing.\n\n1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:30.360\n Well, you said dumpster fire was amazing.\n\n1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:34.920\n It's like, it's incredibly, incredibly lonely.\n\n1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:39.000\n And it just breaks everything that you knew about humanness.\n\n1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:39.840\n And it sucks.\n\n1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:42.800\n So then you're seeking out people who,\n\n1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.200\n that it doesn't exist with.\n\n1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:46.120\n And family is the closest you can get to that for sure.\n\n1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:47.760\n But even your family, it's gonna take a little bit\n\n1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.160\n where they're like, oh, this is a little weird.\n\n1:02:49.160 --> 1:02:51.840\n Like all my friends at work are now asking about you\n\n1:02:51.840 --> 1:02:53.120\n and you're my young, stupid brother.\n\n1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:55.200\n But now you're suddenly like the young, stupid brother\n\n1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:56.640\n that they want an autograph from and stuff.\n\n1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:59.200\n And it still makes, like they have to get over that\n\n1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:00.240\n and figure that out.\n\n1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:04.280\n And then you meet people too\n\n1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:06.440\n who know about this whole concept and they're like,\n\n1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:08.160\n well, I'm gonna be an asshole to him\n\n1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:11.720\n to show him that I don't subscribe.\n\n1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:14.040\n And you're dealing with like people who are like,\n\n1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:15.880\n dumpster fire, the person who's like,\n\n1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:19.440\n you could say something actually profound and nice\n\n1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:22.640\n and they'd be like, that's stupid and you're an idiot.\n\n1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:25.640\n Cause it's like an actual attempt to like show you\n\n1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:27.280\n how much they don't care.\n\n1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.840\n So you live in this very, like this.\n\n1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.160\n Still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you,\n\n1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:35.040\n you were seeking for deep human connection\n\n1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:37.000\n with a small number of people.\n\n1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.200\n And now when a lot of people know you,\n\n1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:41.200\n you're still looking for deep connection\n\n1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:43.280\n with a small number of people.\n\n1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:45.000\n The struggle is the same.\n\n1:03:46.040 --> 1:03:47.400\n Can you speak to,\n\n1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:49.640\n cause you mentioned some of the dark moments.\n\n1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:51.360\n What advice would you give to people\n\n1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:53.640\n who are struggling with depression?\n\n1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:57.560\n And maybe for the people who love the people\n\n1:03:57.560 --> 1:03:59.360\n who are struggling with depression.\n\n1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:03.600\n So what I have found to be most successful for me,\n\n1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:09.160\n it's back to the basics of everything\n\n1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:12.280\n that the therapist or psychologist will tell you,\n\n1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:13.760\n psychiatrist will tell you right when you meet them,\n\n1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.440\n which is exercise every day,\n\n1:04:19.200 --> 1:04:22.520\n eat healthy for sure,\n\n1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.760\n find time, make time every day to do something\n\n1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:27.840\n that you love, whatever that may be,\n\n1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:29.200\n whatever brings you joy.\n\n1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:32.560\n And when you're really depressed,\n\n1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:34.440\n that actually feels like nothing.\n\n1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.400\n Cause the things that brought you joy,\n\n1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:37.760\n don't bring you joy anymore.\n\n1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:39.920\n When I'm really in the thick of it.\n\n1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:43.840\n But for me, like this is the cycle\n\n1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:46.000\n that I'll go through is I'll look at my life\n\n1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.400\n and I'll say, okay, what can I clean up?\n\n1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:51.960\n All right, well, for me it was cutting out alcohol\n\n1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:53.160\n actually helped me a lot.\n\n1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.240\n I know that sounds like a big,\n\n1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:59.200\n I'm not judging anybody for that.\n\n1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:01.040\n And I still drink on occasion,\n\n1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:03.840\n but I felt like alcohol has been very unhelpful\n\n1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.120\n to my mental state.\n\n1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:09.320\n Feel less drive and less happiness the next day\n\n1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:10.320\n for things that I wanna do.\n\n1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:12.760\n I feel like it plays a lot with your serotonin.\n\n1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:14.680\n So look for stuff to change.\n\n1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:16.600\n Clean living, yeah, clean living,\n\n1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:21.600\n but also understanding that sometimes it just is,\n\n1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.040\n and you just keep breathing\n\n1:05:24.040 --> 1:05:25.960\n and it will get better with time.\n\n1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:27.080\n This too shall pass.\n\n1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:27.920\n This too shall pass.\n\n1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:31.360\n Like I really think that in the winter,\n\n1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:33.760\n I'm pretty sure, I mean, I've had a lot of,\n\n1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:34.680\n I've seen a lot of therapists\n\n1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:35.800\n and all of them say the same thing,\n\n1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:37.800\n which is like, you have major depressive disorder\n\n1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:38.640\n and this is what it is,\n\n1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:41.360\n but it's certainly worse for me in the winter months.\n\n1:05:41.360 --> 1:05:44.760\n So I know there's like, I can't think of the term for it,\n\n1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:47.120\n but there's a term for like seasonal depression.\n\n1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:47.960\n There it is.\n\n1:05:49.200 --> 1:05:51.040\n So I'll get to the winter and suddenly I'm like,\n\n1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:55.120\n geez, everything really sucks on a deeper level.\n\n1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:58.280\n And then, so it's like this too shall pass is another thing.\n\n1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:01.080\n It's like, just practice those things.\n\n1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:02.800\n Absolutely see a therapist.\n\n1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:04.960\n That's my biggest, like my biggest emphasis of life\n\n1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:07.440\n is to like on stage, like my goal,\n\n1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:09.480\n like I have a few things that I really, really care about.\n\n1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:13.640\n One is mental health and destigmatizing therapy.\n\n1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:15.640\n Cause for me, I didn't go to therapy for a long time\n\n1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:18.680\n because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken.\n\n1:06:18.680 --> 1:06:22.320\n It'd be admitting that I was weaker than Lex\n\n1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:23.880\n who doesn't have to go to a therapist\n\n1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:25.480\n because Lex is stronger.\n\n1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:27.880\n So be strong like Lex.\n\n1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.400\n I would like look at all my older brothers\n\n1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:30.600\n and I looked up to them so much\n\n1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:32.880\n and they're all these incredibly successful people,\n\n1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:35.960\n plastic surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a dentist,\n\n1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:38.240\n two attorneys, Stanford, NYU,\n\n1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:41.680\n like just like incredible high standards,\n\n1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:45.400\n Eagle Scouts, you know, like they valedictorians,\n\n1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.360\n like they just did it all.\n\n1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:52.360\n So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit\n\n1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:55.320\n and none of them went to therapy.\n\n1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:56.680\n So it was like, what are you going to be?\n\n1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.000\n Are you, oh, you're broken.\n\n1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.160\n Are you like the weak one who can't hack life?\n\n1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:03.600\n And I think that's incredibly dangerous.\n\n1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:05.600\n And I feel like it almost cost me my life\n\n1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:08.600\n because I took so long to finally go to therapy.\n\n1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:10.760\n So I really want kids to know,\n\n1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:14.440\n hey, like the great people that achieve great things\n\n1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:16.120\n that are doing amazing things,\n\n1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:18.720\n they probably have help, almost all of them.\n\n1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:21.320\n It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym.\n\n1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:23.440\n What, so I, unfortunately,\n\n1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:26.040\n I wanted to be a psychiatrist when I was growing up.\n\n1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:29.040\n Maybe that's why I like podcasts.\n\n1:07:29.040 --> 1:07:29.880\n Maybe that's.\n\n1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:30.720\n I think you'd be a good one.\n\n1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:32.280\n Maybe, I would.\n\n1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:35.360\n I think you are a psychiatrist, pretty much, right?\n\n1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.200\n Sounds like you're a psychiatrist.\n\n1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:37.120\n I think I need more.\n\n1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:41.200\n I think actually, to be a good psychiatrist,\n\n1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:44.480\n you also need to be seeking therapy from the,\n\n1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.520\n like you also need to be,\n\n1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.000\n have some stuff to work through in your mind.\n\n1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.880\n I think, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places.\n\n1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:56.400\n What?\n\n1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:57.240\n The empathize.\n\n1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:58.080\n The empathy.\n\n1:07:58.080 --> 1:07:59.200\n It's the ability to empathize,\n\n1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:02.160\n and especially if you've directly experienced it,\n\n1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:04.840\n you can go to those places in your mind.\n\n1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:06.720\n Like you said, it's with the music,\n\n1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:08.560\n to be authentic, you have to really go there.\n\n1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:12.680\n What, why did therapy help so much?\n\n1:08:12.680 --> 1:08:14.600\n What is the process of therapy,\n\n1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:16.800\n if you can just educate a little more?\n\n1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:20.720\n Is it, are you basically bringing to the surface\n\n1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.520\n and talking through things that you,\n\n1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:27.760\n because of the momentum of life,\n\n1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:31.240\n you just never allow yourself to speak through,\n\n1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:32.440\n to think through?\n\n1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:33.680\n Is that what therapy is?\n\n1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:36.280\n Or is there some more systematic thing?\n\n1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:38.760\n So I've been to a lot of strange,\n\n1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:39.840\n different kinds of therapy.\n\n1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:41.720\n So I'll tell you my first therapist.\n\n1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.560\n If I could sort of interrupt,\n\n1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:47.760\n how hard is it to find a therapist that connected with you?\n\n1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:50.880\n It is, it's actually pretty hard, I think.\n\n1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:53.400\n I think, I think it for,\n\n1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:55.080\n well, actually I have a skewed view of that,\n\n1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:59.440\n because going back to the beginning of my therapy\n\n1:08:59.440 --> 1:09:01.960\n was with a Mormon therapist.\n\n1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:03.900\n So it was very much like,\n\n1:09:03.900 --> 1:09:05.880\n well, are you reading your book of Mormon?\n\n1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:07.440\n And are you praying at night?\n\n1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:08.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:10.080\n Like, that was a big focus of my therapy\n\n1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:10.920\n to begin with.\n\n1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:13.720\n And you're having a faith crisis in the distance somewhere.\n\n1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:17.040\n Yes, I was like, well, and then.\n\n1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:18.080\n You're making it worse.\n\n1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:20.640\n Yes, the next therapist I went to\n\n1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:25.280\n was a Scientology therapist.\n\n1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:28.120\n I met my wife and she was Scientologist at the time,\n\n1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:29.640\n and she's not anymore.\n\n1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:33.880\n She's like, it's such a funny thing to look back on,\n\n1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:36.920\n because we met, and I was like this Mormon missionary\n\n1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:38.200\n who had just got home from his mission,\n\n1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:40.120\n and I met her, and she's a Scientologist.\n\n1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:41.720\n I was like, wow, that's batshit crazy.\n\n1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:43.840\n Like, that stuff's crazy.\n\n1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:44.740\n And she's like, what are you talking about?\n\n1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:47.120\n That's your crazy, you're a Mormon.\n\n1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:48.720\n That's batshit crazy.\n\n1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:51.760\n And the two of us were like, huh,\n\n1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:54.280\n maybe there's something to this, to both of us here.\n\n1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:56.760\n Yeah, the tension actually forces you to think through,\n\n1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.280\n oh, well, what is true?\n\n1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:01.520\n Yeah, and we really fell in love through that,\n\n1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.200\n which was like, maybe we're both on the wrong track.\n\n1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:06.200\n Let's figure this out.\n\n1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:07.540\n But before that happened,\n\n1:10:07.540 --> 1:10:12.120\n we went to a Scientologist therapist,\n\n1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:14.600\n who that therapy consisted of,\n\n1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:17.760\n what have you done wrong to Asia?\n\n1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:19.240\n And they would ask me that question\n\n1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:20.880\n over and over and over and over,\n\n1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:23.420\n until I'm like thinking of the deepest, darkest things\n\n1:10:23.420 --> 1:10:25.660\n that were in the recesses of my mind.\n\n1:10:25.660 --> 1:10:28.280\n This was marriage therapy.\n\n1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:30.240\n Anyway, I'm not gonna get into that,\n\n1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:32.400\n but it was Scientology therapy.\n\n1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:33.520\n So that was a different thing.\n\n1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:36.680\n And then I went to therapy therapy,\n\n1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:39.040\n like no, not attached to any religion.\n\n1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:40.960\n And that was a really great experience for me.\n\n1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.200\n And since then I've been through\n\n1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:43.120\n a couple of different therapists,\n\n1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:45.720\n but that was more because where I was\n\n1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:47.680\n and moving and things like that.\n\n1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:50.160\n So is it that hard to find a great therapist?\n\n1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.800\n Probably not, but maybe don't go\n\n1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:52.880\n to your Mormon therapist\n\n1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:55.520\n versus that Scientology therapist.\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.760\n Or maybe that's the route for you.\n\n1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.080\n Maybe it's the route for you, I don't know.\n\n1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:01.320\n Yeah, but what is, so is it bringing stuff\n\n1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:02.840\n to the surface, basically?\n\n1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:04.440\n Oh yeah, sorry, I didn't even answer your question.\n\n1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:06.520\n What's the effect, why is it so effective?\n\n1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:10.220\n Just, is there something you could put words to?\n\n1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:11.720\n Yeah, I mean, I think it's, obviously,\n\n1:11:11.720 --> 1:11:13.180\n there's the common things you would think of,\n\n1:11:13.180 --> 1:11:15.120\n which is like, oh, I've been holding these things in\n\n1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:16.160\n that I don't wanna tell anybody,\n\n1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:17.280\n and then I tell this person,\n\n1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:19.240\n and oh, there's relief in that.\n\n1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.480\n But that's really not where the real work comes from.\n\n1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:24.600\n I think the real work is meeting with someone\n\n1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:29.000\n who is well versed and educated and understands.\n\n1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:30.720\n It's like coding.\n\n1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.760\n It really is, it's like someone who,\n\n1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:33.920\n they listen to you, and they're like,\n\n1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:34.800\n well, that was a trigger,\n\n1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:36.240\n and then this became this trigger,\n\n1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:38.280\n and you're probably, every time you're hearing that,\n\n1:11:38.280 --> 1:11:41.340\n thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life,\n\n1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.120\n and they just will walk you through scenarios,\n\n1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:44.520\n and maybe some of them aren't right,\n\n1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:45.640\n but some of them, you'll be like,\n\n1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:47.040\n it'll resonate sometimes, you're like,\n\n1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:50.080\n wow, I am feeling that because of that,\n\n1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:52.640\n and that did happen, and maybe if I call my mom\n\n1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:54.520\n and say this to her, it will make me feel,\n\n1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.520\n hey mom, this happened, it's like work.\n\n1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.080\n You put in work, and you have hard conversations\n\n1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:00.600\n and do difficult things,\n\n1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:03.440\n and if, so if your therapy's not difficult,\n\n1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:05.600\n I actually think that's not good therapy.\n\n1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:08.320\n Good therapy is, it's gonna be a little difficult,\n\n1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:10.280\n it's work, like.\n\n1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:11.560\n During and after.\n\n1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:15.360\n Yes, like I had this incredible therapist who was,\n\n1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:16.840\n I told him when I was gonna do ayahuasca,\n\n1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:18.240\n he was like, geez, you know,\n\n1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:20.320\n he had actually was a doctor before\n\n1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:22.520\n and a really well educated studied person\n\n1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:26.560\n who had walked away from brain doctor,\n\n1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.280\n what's the word for that, brain doctor?\n\n1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.720\n Brain surgeon? Neurologist.\n\n1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:30.880\n Oh yeah, neurologist, yep.\n\n1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:35.880\n And he said, well basically his belief was that ayahuasca\n\n1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:39.720\n was like basically doing therapy like 50 sessions.\n\n1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.000\n He was like, it's like really intensive.\n\n1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.320\n He was like, I don't know if you wanna do that,\n\n1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:47.560\n if you do, you can make some big steps forward,\n\n1:12:47.560 --> 1:12:51.000\n but I prefer just to do one session at a time.\n\n1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.920\n And so yeah, it's hard work.\n\n1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:56.360\n And that, I typically like,\n\n1:12:56.360 --> 1:12:58.000\n it's really hard for me to even talk about ayahuasca\n\n1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:58.920\n by the way, going back to that,\n\n1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:01.840\n because I'm not looking to tell everybody to go do ayahuasca.\n\n1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:03.800\n It's incredibly hard.\n\n1:13:03.800 --> 1:13:07.120\n It was the scariest experience of my entire life.\n\n1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:08.560\n It felt like I went to heaven,\n\n1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:11.680\n but it also felt like I went to the darkest, deepest hell\n\n1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:16.680\n that was incredibly scary, incredibly scary, yeah.\n\n1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:21.680\n So you told the story of how you wrote the song Believer\n\n1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.240\n or like your childhood friend, I guess, Donald,\n\n1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:30.340\n like bullying and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:34.040\n This song, I mean, a lot of your songs\n\n1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:37.920\n are super interesting sort of in terms of percussion,\n\n1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:40.480\n super interesting, super interesting lyrically,\n\n1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:45.480\n just how it flows and also pain is at the center of it.\n\n1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.200\n I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith,\n\n1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:50.680\n some of these existential questions\n\n1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:54.560\n are basically behind a lot of your songs, funny enough.\n\n1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:59.440\n Maybe they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see,\n\n1:14:00.340 --> 1:14:01.180\n but it's there.\n\n1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:05.560\n And this song is really interesting in that way\n\n1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:10.560\n that it puts pain, you made me a believer.\n\n1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:15.560\n You break me down, you build me up, Believer.\n\n1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:17.520\n That's so interesting.\n\n1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:22.140\n Maybe can you tell the story of how the song came to be?\n\n1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:23.220\n I'd love to listen to it too.\n\n1:14:23.220 --> 1:14:25.220\n I have some questions musically about it too.\n\n1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:29.900\n Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's exactly\n\n1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:30.860\n what we're talking about with therapy.\n\n1:14:30.860 --> 1:14:34.860\n I just feel like the greatest things in my life\n\n1:14:34.860 --> 1:14:39.860\n have come from the deepest hurt, like losing someone,\n\n1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:48.700\n that you love is maybe the hardest part of the human path\n\n1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:51.260\n for me, at least thus far.\n\n1:14:51.260 --> 1:14:52.820\n When I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?\n\n1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:55.740\n There's like, you think of physical pain\n\n1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:58.540\n or maybe like going through financial pain or whatever.\n\n1:14:58.540 --> 1:15:02.140\n I think losing someone that you really love to death\n\n1:15:02.140 --> 1:15:05.260\n is one of the hardest, for me,\n\n1:15:05.260 --> 1:15:06.860\n I would say it was the hardest.\n\n1:15:08.580 --> 1:15:10.060\n But it also makes you look at your life\n\n1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:13.160\n completely differently and alter your life,\n\n1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:15.660\n at least for me in ways that were really healthy.\n\n1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:19.300\n Being more present, letting go of things\n\n1:15:19.300 --> 1:15:21.180\n that were meaningless, trying to control\n\n1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:22.420\n what other people think about you,\n\n1:15:22.420 --> 1:15:25.300\n like wasting your time on things like that.\n\n1:15:25.300 --> 1:15:27.840\n And you suddenly see like, wow, like time,\n\n1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:31.160\n I got small amount of time, like how do I wanna spend it?\n\n1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:34.140\n I'm gonna spend it in the best way I know how and that's it.\n\n1:15:34.140 --> 1:15:37.860\n So, yeah, I mean, it's a basic concept\n\n1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:39.120\n that's been said a million times over\n\n1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:39.960\n in a million different ways.\n\n1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:42.860\n But that's pretty much what I was trying to say with Believer\n\n1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:46.300\n which is like, I've lost faith in everything\n\n1:15:46.300 --> 1:15:51.020\n at that time period or previous to that time period.\n\n1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:53.180\n And then I was rebuilding my faith\n\n1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:57.160\n or my spiritual thought process.\n\n1:15:57.160 --> 1:16:02.100\n And it was after ayahuasca and it was like, finding,\n\n1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:05.780\n being a Believer and that's not necessarily like\n\n1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:09.220\n a Believer in God or a Believer in heaven and hell\n\n1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:12.860\n or anything like that, but a Believer in more.\n\n1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:17.700\n Believing in goodness, believing in that there is some light\n\n1:16:17.700 --> 1:16:22.700\n like, and again, those words like, they're just words\n\n1:16:22.780 --> 1:16:24.660\n and I wish there were better words to formulate\n\n1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:25.900\n the thought that I'm trying to express,\n\n1:16:25.900 --> 1:16:30.900\n but just more, like the thought of me dying,\n\n1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:37.820\n for me, I don't fear it, I don't fear it,\n\n1:16:37.820 --> 1:16:42.520\n but actually I really fear not seeing my kids again.\n\n1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:44.820\n I'll say that, that is fearful for me.\n\n1:16:44.820 --> 1:16:48.040\n I feel like I love so deeply these children\n\n1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:51.140\n that the thought of like leaving them\n\n1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:55.300\n for me is a scary thought or something.\n\n1:16:55.300 --> 1:16:58.180\n They're kind of good reminder\n\n1:16:58.180 --> 1:17:00.800\n how much you love life actually.\n\n1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:04.160\n And you don't always remember that.\n\n1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:07.260\n Yeah, and I think having kids is not for everyone\n\n1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:09.540\n for absolutely for sure, but for me,\n\n1:17:09.540 --> 1:17:11.420\n and especially you shouldn't be having kids\n\n1:17:11.420 --> 1:17:13.140\n to give yourself a reason to live.\n\n1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:16.980\n I feel like dying, I'm gonna have a kid.\n\n1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:20.540\n You might feel more like dying after having a kid actually.\n\n1:17:20.540 --> 1:17:23.900\n It's pretty stressful, but it is a place to like,\n\n1:17:23.900 --> 1:17:26.480\n I've changed a lot of people that I've known\n\n1:17:26.480 --> 1:17:29.660\n that it gave them a new intensity\n\n1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:32.700\n of gratitude for life, for sure.\n\n1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.740\n Guy, do you mind if we, I'll return to the pain\n\n1:17:35.740 --> 1:17:37.080\n and the belief, do you mind if we listen\n\n1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:38.140\n to a little bit of songs?\n\n1:17:38.140 --> 1:17:38.980\n No, it's fine.\n\n1:17:44.840 --> 1:17:47.380\n Do you write the music first or the words first?\n\n1:17:47.380 --> 1:17:51.620\n Uh, the same time, which is very typical for me.\n\n1:17:51.620 --> 1:17:56.620\n By just the way it opens, intensity of openings.\n\n1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:00.100\n You ever think about what the first few seconds sound like?\n\n1:18:00.100 --> 1:18:03.880\n Is that something that, like when you imagine a song,\n\n1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:06.180\n is it the opening you imagine?\n\n1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:10.500\n No, it's kind of a, I never think opening,\n\n1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:14.180\n I never think final, I think soundscape\n\n1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:16.240\n of how I'm feeling right now.\n\n1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:17.820\n So it could be the middle of the song\n\n1:18:17.820 --> 1:18:20.320\n for all I know when I'm doing that,\n\n1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:24.700\n but my process for me is very much lyrics and melody\n\n1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:27.500\n and music really come at the same time.\n\n1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:30.360\n Like I, by same time, I mean, I'm,\n\n1:18:31.740 --> 1:18:34.980\n I'm, as I'm expressing maybe, you know,\n\n1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:35.820\n I'm feeling like.\n\n1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:44.340\n Like, it's not that simple, but it's like,\n\n1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:47.540\n I'll hear it, like, it's like, here's all the orchestra\n\n1:18:47.540 --> 1:18:49.540\n and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once\n\n1:18:49.540 --> 1:18:53.600\n and melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.\n\n1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:54.440\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:56.020\n It's just utilizing one instrument.\n\n1:18:56.020 --> 1:18:57.820\n So you've seen the landscape and that landscape\n\n1:18:57.820 --> 1:19:01.220\n includes melody, includes percussion, lyrics a little bit,\n\n1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:02.180\n or lyrics?\n\n1:19:02.180 --> 1:19:05.180\n I will be words to begin with, like a word here and there.\n\n1:19:05.180 --> 1:19:06.080\n Like, I'll be like.\n\n1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:12.820\n You know, I'm like, what's a word that I'm thinking of\n\n1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:14.780\n when I'm feeling this soundscape?\n\n1:19:14.780 --> 1:19:19.280\n And I always create with no theme in mind.\n\n1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:21.740\n I'm never, for better or for worse,\n\n1:19:21.740 --> 1:19:24.400\n just my process is I'm sitting down\n\n1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:26.580\n and I'm writing a journal entry.\n\n1:19:26.580 --> 1:19:27.420\n Simple as that.\n\n1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:29.500\n It's like, when you sit down to write a journal entry,\n\n1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.860\n are you sitting down and you're like, Kev,\n\n1:19:31.860 --> 1:19:33.980\n I've had all these words here that I'm gonna put on the page\n\n1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:35.580\n and I'm gonna order it in this way.\n\n1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:38.260\n And my theme for my journal entry today is gonna be this.\n\n1:19:38.260 --> 1:19:39.380\n Maybe some people do, but I don't.\n\n1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:42.060\n My journal entry is, I don't know what I'm gonna say.\n\n1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.020\n Oh, how was today?\n\n1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:45.480\n Well, man, today was this and feeling this.\n\n1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:46.320\n And now that I think about that,\n\n1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:47.660\n I'm really angry about that.\n\n1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:49.380\n That hurt my feelings when this happened.\n\n1:19:49.380 --> 1:19:51.900\n I mean, you're like, you're formulating it as you go\n\n1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:53.080\n and that's the joy of it.\n\n1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:55.360\n And for me, that's what music is.\n\n1:19:55.360 --> 1:19:57.820\n So I'll sit down, not thinking,\n\n1:19:57.820 --> 1:20:00.540\n hey, I've been wanting to write a song that has a hard beat\n\n1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:02.220\n or I've been wanting to write a song that's anthemic\n\n1:20:02.220 --> 1:20:03.860\n or I've been wanting to write a song that's,\n\n1:20:03.860 --> 1:20:06.080\n it's like, how am I feeling right now?\n\n1:20:06.080 --> 1:20:07.340\n And it's joyful?\n\n1:20:07.340 --> 1:20:10.980\n Is the feeling joyful to you or is it struggle?\n\n1:20:10.980 --> 1:20:14.460\n You just made it sound like it's joyful.\n\n1:20:15.940 --> 1:20:17.300\n Or at least fulfilling.\n\n1:20:17.300 --> 1:20:18.140\n I wouldn't use that.\n\n1:20:18.140 --> 1:20:20.180\n Yeah, fulfilling is the word I was kind of looking for,\n\n1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:21.020\n but there was.\n\n1:20:21.020 --> 1:20:23.020\n There's a lot of artists talk about really struggle,\n\n1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:24.500\n like you talk about writers.\n\n1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:26.460\n Cathartic, that's the word I was looking for.\n\n1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:30.460\n It feels like having a good moment with a therapist\n\n1:20:30.460 --> 1:20:34.540\n where you're like, okay, I'm expressing this thing\n\n1:20:34.540 --> 1:20:36.100\n that I just need to express.\n\n1:20:36.100 --> 1:20:38.980\n For whatever reason, I need to express this.\n\n1:20:38.980 --> 1:20:40.220\n The majority of the songs I write,\n\n1:20:40.220 --> 1:20:41.580\n for the record, are never heard.\n\n1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:43.800\n I write over 100 songs a year.\n\n1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:47.900\n I release 20 songs every three years.\n\n1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:49.780\n So, I don't know, what's that percent?\n\n1:20:49.780 --> 1:20:51.120\n 20 out of 300.\n\n1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:51.960\n Come on, Lex.\n\n1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:55.620\n It's less than 10%.\n\n1:20:55.620 --> 1:20:56.740\n Less than 10%, yeah.\n\n1:20:56.740 --> 1:20:57.780\n Eight, seven or something?\n\n1:20:57.780 --> 1:20:58.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:59.460 --> 1:21:01.080\n Anyway, so it's.\n\n1:21:01.080 --> 1:21:02.680\n And then getting together with the band\n\n1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:04.740\n and getting them selected down\n\n1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:06.740\n is really what the process has.\n\n1:21:06.740 --> 1:21:11.740\n So you're really writing a song per one to three days.\n\n1:21:11.740 --> 1:21:16.380\n Three days, maybe a song that you can't quite figure out\n\n1:21:16.380 --> 1:21:20.140\n the puzzle of that's gonna last a little longer.\n\n1:21:20.140 --> 1:21:20.980\n Is it worth the struggle?\n\n1:21:20.980 --> 1:21:22.100\n I finish every idea.\n\n1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:23.940\n Yeah, you finish every idea.\n\n1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:25.100\n I do, I finish every idea.\n\n1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:28.100\n So it's not just like laying completely unfinished.\n\n1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:30.000\n I could open my computer for you right now\n\n1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.260\n and I would show you hundreds and hundreds of songs\n\n1:21:33.260 --> 1:21:35.300\n that you would listen to and think,\n\n1:21:35.300 --> 1:21:36.420\n that sounds like a song.\n\n1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:38.340\n It's like there's rhythm, there's melody,\n\n1:21:38.340 --> 1:21:40.660\n there's multiple instruments, there's lyrics.\n\n1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:45.020\n Like I, it's the same thing as for coding for me,\n\n1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:47.660\n which is music, which is I can't walk away\n\n1:21:47.660 --> 1:21:48.500\n until I've completed it.\n\n1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:50.160\n But it's finished.\n\n1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:51.000\n Well, finished is.\n\n1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:52.860\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it sounds like a song.\n\n1:21:52.860 --> 1:21:55.060\n I certainly do a lot more with it after,\n\n1:21:55.060 --> 1:21:56.740\n with the band, we'll pull it all apart.\n\n1:21:56.740 --> 1:21:58.140\n But it's a song.\n\n1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.620\n It'll be like, you know, you'll listen to it and say,\n\n1:22:00.620 --> 1:22:01.460\n okay, that was a song.\n\n1:22:01.460 --> 1:22:05.820\n I get, you understand what it is, for sure.\n\n1:22:05.820 --> 1:22:08.340\n Do you think, this is a painful question\n\n1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:10.400\n from a fan perspective.\n\n1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:15.400\n Do you think there's genius on your computer\n\n1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:19.500\n that you walked away from that you just didn't notice it?\n\n1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:21.980\n Like, do you think there's truly great songs\n\n1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:25.940\n that you've written that you just didn't notice\n\n1:22:25.940 --> 1:22:26.900\n how great they are?\n\n1:22:26.900 --> 1:22:31.900\n I think greatness is something that I feel I'm,\n\n1:22:32.340 --> 1:22:34.660\n I don't feel like I've achieved greatness.\n\n1:22:34.660 --> 1:22:36.300\n Genuine, I'm not saying that to you\n\n1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:38.220\n in a way of like humility, falseness.\n\n1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:39.660\n Like Michael Jordan type.\n\n1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:44.660\n No, genuinely, I feel like I am on a journey right now\n\n1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:46.300\n to find who I am.\n\n1:22:46.300 --> 1:22:48.980\n And I'm 34 and it's like, I don't even,\n\n1:22:48.980 --> 1:22:50.920\n I haven't begun that journey.\n\n1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.980\n I feel like I'm just starting that.\n\n1:22:52.980 --> 1:22:57.980\n But that being said, I certainly don't know\n\n1:22:59.180 --> 1:23:02.120\n the right answer to what songs are, you know,\n\n1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:04.180\n beloved or good to the masses.\n\n1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:06.640\n Like Imagine Dragons is such a massive entity.\n\n1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:09.520\n It's like, there have been a, I will say this,\n\n1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:12.260\n there are a couple of times where I fought really hard\n\n1:23:12.260 --> 1:23:15.220\n to decide on the single, really hard.\n\n1:23:15.220 --> 1:23:17.920\n Or I always fight for what goes on the record, always.\n\n1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:19.220\n I always put the record together\n\n1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:20.820\n and that's the record that I wanted to be\n\n1:23:20.820 --> 1:23:22.520\n and me and the guys come up with that.\n\n1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:25.780\n And it's nobody else has influenced, no manager, no label.\n\n1:23:25.780 --> 1:23:29.220\n The single, everybody wants to have a saying.\n\n1:23:29.220 --> 1:23:30.660\n Your label wants to have a saying in it.\n\n1:23:30.660 --> 1:23:32.860\n Your manager wants to have a saying in it.\n\n1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:35.260\n And I have fought really hard over that.\n\n1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:37.660\n And I've been wrong before and I've been right before.\n\n1:23:37.660 --> 1:23:42.140\n But as far as songs that I haven't put out, I mean.\n\n1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:44.560\n Because you can imagine so many songs,\n\n1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:47.800\n you think of so many Beatles songs\n\n1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:49.400\n that are like some of their greats,\n\n1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:51.320\n while my guitar gently weeps.\n\n1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:55.360\n I'm trying to imagine weird sounding,\n\n1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.440\n not that interesting possibly songs.\n\n1:23:57.440 --> 1:23:58.720\n The majority of what we put them.\n\n1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:02.160\n Honestly, it may be our best stuff\n\n1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:03.640\n is that we don't put out for instance.\n\n1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:08.640\n Because our band is such a, it's such a complex question.\n\n1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.320\n I really don't know actually.\n\n1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:12.600\n I don't know, maybe one day I'll die\n\n1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:13.960\n and people will look and be like,\n\n1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:16.040\n I hated Imagine Dragons, but now I listen to that song.\n\n1:24:16.040 --> 1:24:17.680\n I really liked that, wish they would put that out.\n\n1:24:17.680 --> 1:24:19.400\n Or maybe they'll be like, oh, it's all sounds like shit.\n\n1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:20.400\n I don't really know.\n\n1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.420\n Well, that's, sorry, it is a tragic thing.\n\n1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:27.080\n That's why I asked it, which is like,\n\n1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:31.080\n there could be some great, incredible things\n\n1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:35.360\n that will take you a long time to rediscover,\n\n1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:36.920\n to realize how great they are.\n\n1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:40.840\n And it's also the tragic aspect of being an artist\n\n1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:45.020\n is you don't know, forget fame or all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:24:45.020 --> 1:24:46.880\n You don't know what's going to really move people.\n\n1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:51.220\n Cause ultimately what you want is to connect with people\n\n1:24:51.220 --> 1:24:53.320\n and you don't know what that's going to be.\n\n1:24:54.240 --> 1:24:57.280\n It's hard, I mean, to me it's tragic\n\n1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:58.480\n just as a fan of yours to see,\n\n1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:01.720\n maybe I wonder if there's like incredible stuff there.\n\n1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:04.400\n Just as it is tragic to see great artists throughout history\n\n1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:06.920\n who didn't get recognition until they died.\n\n1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:09.880\n It's like, cause they basically held on,\n\n1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:14.160\n Franz Kafka was extremely self critical.\n\n1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:17.620\n A lot of these folks had an idea of what's good and not,\n\n1:25:17.620 --> 1:25:18.620\n and they were wrong.\n\n1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:23.440\n They had genius, they weren't entirely wrong\n\n1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.320\n cause they became sufficiently popular,\n\n1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.240\n but it's interesting.\n\n1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:29.840\n I try to genuinely to release the songs\n\n1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:31.560\n that move me the most.\n\n1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:32.400\n I'll say that.\n\n1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:34.000\n You're your own audience.\n\n1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:39.000\n Yeah, I try to put out the songs that make me feel the most.\n\n1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.640\n Like I feel that, that's my only gauge\n\n1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:45.480\n because it's so subjective of like, what is good?\n\n1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:46.320\n What's this?\n\n1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:48.960\n Nobody knows the song the masses are going to like.\n\n1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:51.000\n Nobody knows that formula, nobody knows it.\n\n1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.400\n So for me, it's always what makes me feel something.\n\n1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:55.000\n One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me\n\n1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.160\n when we worked with him on this record\n\n1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:00.640\n was he would say, his main point\n\n1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:03.640\n that he would continually bring up when like,\n\n1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.100\n cause he's not the type of person to be like,\n\n1:26:05.100 --> 1:26:06.680\n that's a bad song or that's good.\n\n1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:07.800\n It's just not who Rick Rubin is.\n\n1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:09.760\n It's more like, there's more nuance to it.\n\n1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:14.600\n He would say, I don't really believe you on that song.\n\n1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:16.960\n That's what he would say.\n\n1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:19.000\n He would say, and I knew that was like,\n\n1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:21.320\n that song's a no go.\n\n1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:23.280\n He would say, and I would genuinely,\n\n1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:24.920\n there was a time he said it and it was about a song\n\n1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:27.760\n that I really like, I really felt it\n\n1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:29.320\n and meant it when I said it.\n\n1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:32.280\n But he didn't believe it when he heard it.\n\n1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:33.240\n And that was enough for, I was like,\n\n1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:35.080\n man, well, at the end of the day,\n\n1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:36.400\n like I can believe it all I want,\n\n1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:39.360\n but if the listener doesn't feel the honesty in it,\n\n1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:40.360\n just like we were talking about earlier,\n\n1:26:40.360 --> 1:26:42.480\n I think the most important ingredient is,\n\n1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:45.860\n is this truth, perceived as truth to someone else?\n\n1:26:45.860 --> 1:26:48.080\n And if it's not, the bullshit indicator goes,\n\n1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:49.720\n and you're like, I don't care, I don't throw it away.\n\n1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:50.560\n I don't care about it.\n\n1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:55.480\n You said that he made you go through, like line by line,\n\n1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:56.360\n the lyrics.\n\n1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.660\n Every single, it was excruciating for me.\n\n1:26:59.860 --> 1:27:02.280\n Why was that excruciating?\n\n1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:03.920\n Well, first of all, it's Rick Rubin.\n\n1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:06.520\n So you're in the room with like Rick Rubin,\n\n1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:09.840\n who's done a lot of the greatest of all time.\n\n1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.480\n And so I had to first just put that aside\n\n1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:14.320\n and be like, okay, well,\n\n1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:15.600\n you've done a lot of my favorite records,\n\n1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:18.920\n but still you're human and not everything you say\n\n1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:20.280\n is gonna be right.\n\n1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.000\n And I'm a strongly opinionated person,\n\n1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.200\n and so is Rick.\n\n1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:24.960\n And so when the two of us were sitting down in a room\n\n1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:27.040\n together, it was, you know.\n\n1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:30.160\n But the lyrics, which is interesting.\n\n1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:32.360\n So it's not the entire composition,\n\n1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:34.240\n but just like, let's look at the lyrics.\n\n1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:35.400\n What do you mean here?\n\n1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:37.680\n Yeah, oh yeah, cause he would look over every,\n\n1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:42.160\n there was like, and there were battles he won,\n\n1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:45.760\n battles that he didn't win, and maybe he was right.\n\n1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:46.600\n I don't know.\n\n1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:48.120\n I mean, there was, for instance, I'll give you an example.\n\n1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.760\n There was a song on the record called Number One.\n\n1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:52.760\n Rick will probably laugh when he hears this.\n\n1:27:54.080 --> 1:27:55.960\n Cause this was a big one that we kept going back\n\n1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.120\n and forth on.\n\n1:27:57.120 --> 1:27:58.440\n But this will give you a good insight\n\n1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:01.120\n of what it was like.\n\n1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:02.800\n And there's a line in it that says,\n\n1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:04.800\n I don't know, the chorus is,\n\n1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:06.360\n I don't know what I'm meant to be.\n\n1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:08.320\n I don't need no one to believe.\n\n1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:10.120\n When it's all been said and done,\n\n1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:12.320\n I'm still my number one.\n\n1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:14.320\n And he was like, nah, it just makes me cringe\n\n1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:15.160\n when I hear that.\n\n1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:19.800\n He's like, I just, like, do you have to be like,\n\n1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:21.800\n can it not be like, you're still my number one?\n\n1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:23.480\n And I was like, no, it's not about anybody else.\n\n1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:25.560\n Like, you know, it's about like self love.\n\n1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:28.120\n He's like, yeah, but like, do you need to like talk\n\n1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:29.400\n about self love like that?\n\n1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:31.680\n And I was like, well, I feel like I need to.\n\n1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:33.040\n He's like, well, maybe, you know,\n\n1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.280\n there's something else we could say there.\n\n1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:36.000\n Like we just kept, you know,\n\n1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.200\n we kept coming back to this song, okay?\n\n1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:40.280\n I was like, and I changed it.\n\n1:28:40.280 --> 1:28:41.720\n I tried changing it.\n\n1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:42.560\n What did I change it to?\n\n1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:44.600\n It was like, it wasn't you're still my number one,\n\n1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:45.560\n it just made no sense.\n\n1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:49.680\n It wasn't about some love thing or like someone else.\n\n1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:50.920\n I changed it to something else.\n\n1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:53.360\n And it just, it was the one thing that I was like,\n\n1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:54.560\n I'm really sorry, Rick.\n\n1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:57.000\n Like, I get it.\n\n1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:58.120\n And if it sounds cringy to you,\n\n1:28:58.120 --> 1:28:59.720\n it's definitely sounding cringy to other people too.\n\n1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:00.560\n And that sucks.\n\n1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:02.520\n But I don't know how else to say this\n\n1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:05.760\n in a way that I want to put that song out anymore.\n\n1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:07.400\n But there were other songs for sure\n\n1:29:07.400 --> 1:29:09.840\n where Rick was like, that or this,\n\n1:29:09.840 --> 1:29:11.960\n that word feels a little trite.\n\n1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:13.040\n You already said that once.\n\n1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:14.640\n Can you say it in a different way?\n\n1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:15.600\n It was really helpful.\n\n1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:16.800\n And then, yeah.\n\n1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:17.640\n It's really interesting\n\n1:29:17.640 --> 1:29:20.960\n because you're trying to say something so simply\n\n1:29:21.840 --> 1:29:24.120\n and yet not make it cringe.\n\n1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:25.080\n And that's really hard.\n\n1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:27.720\n That's a strange art form\n\n1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:30.720\n because you want to say some of the greatest love songs.\n\n1:29:30.720 --> 1:29:33.460\n I mean, we looked at the Without You song.\n\n1:29:33.460 --> 1:29:35.600\n I mean, that's the whole thing is cringy.\n\n1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:40.600\n If you just read it on paper, like it's a court report\n\n1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:43.340\n or something, but yet it's not,\n\n1:29:43.340 --> 1:29:45.520\n especially when sung maybe.\n\n1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:49.400\n But no, there's something about, yeah, maybe.\n\n1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.920\n Sung in a way you believe it.\n\n1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:52.020\n When you believe it,\n\n1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.900\n but also written in a way that's singable\n\n1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.100\n in the way you believe it.\n\n1:29:56.100 --> 1:29:56.940\n So it's like.\n\n1:29:56.940 --> 1:29:57.780\n Right.\n\n1:29:57.780 --> 1:29:58.600\n Right.\n\n1:29:58.600 --> 1:29:59.440\n And then.\n\n1:29:59.440 --> 1:30:00.280\n It rolls off.\n\n1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:02.540\n It just comes out in a way that just feels like silky.\n\n1:30:02.540 --> 1:30:05.940\n No word catches your mind as cringy.\n\n1:30:05.940 --> 1:30:06.780\n Yes.\n\n1:30:06.780 --> 1:30:08.100\n It's just.\n\n1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:13.100\n But then music, I think great speeches are like that too,\n\n1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:18.500\n or just conveying, communicating ideas simply.\n\n1:30:19.180 --> 1:30:22.420\n That's the art form is to not be cringy.\n\n1:30:22.420 --> 1:30:23.380\n So interesting.\n\n1:30:23.380 --> 1:30:27.480\n And then yet, because like when you're raw and real,\n\n1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:31.640\n it might at first feel cringy.\n\n1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:34.520\n So the battle there,\n\n1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:39.400\n and that's where you see people fail.\n\n1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:40.660\n Like just regular artists.\n\n1:30:40.660 --> 1:30:43.140\n Like, I don't know, at open mic,\n\n1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:45.820\n I got open mic, so I just listen to musicians.\n\n1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:48.940\n Like when they write songs, like they fail that test.\n\n1:30:48.940 --> 1:30:50.900\n They write simple stuff, but it's cringy.\n\n1:30:50.900 --> 1:30:51.740\n Why?\n\n1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:52.580\n I wonder what was that?\n\n1:30:52.580 --> 1:30:53.660\n Like, what is that?\n\n1:30:53.660 --> 1:30:54.480\n I'm telling you, Lex,\n\n1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:56.860\n I tried to explain this to my brother the other day,\n\n1:30:58.040 --> 1:31:00.820\n because it's the same thing with a live performance.\n\n1:31:00.820 --> 1:31:03.980\n If I'm not in my right head space and I walk on stage\n\n1:31:03.980 --> 1:31:06.980\n and I walk up and let's say I say something and I do this,\n\n1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:10.180\n because I'm like, this is the move, right?\n\n1:31:10.180 --> 1:31:12.180\n I'm like, this is the move.\n\n1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:13.460\n The crowd doesn't care.\n\n1:31:13.460 --> 1:31:16.640\n In fact, the crowd's like, that's cringy when you did this.\n\n1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:19.420\n But if I wasn't thinking about doing this\n\n1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:21.460\n and I went up there and I said something\n\n1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:24.260\n and I really meant it and my body was like,\n\n1:31:24.260 --> 1:31:25.420\n I can't explain this to you,\n\n1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:28.340\n and it's so silly to say out loud,\n\n1:31:28.340 --> 1:31:33.340\n but people will resonate to it when it's real.\n\n1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:35.160\n And when it's acted, it doesn't,\n\n1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:36.520\n you could do it the exact,\n\n1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:39.020\n the motion could look the same, your eyes look the same,\n\n1:31:39.020 --> 1:31:42.600\n but there's something about the energy that people know.\n\n1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:44.000\n They know if it's real or not.\n\n1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:45.460\n Yeah, people have, like you said,\n\n1:31:45.460 --> 1:31:46.800\n incredible bullshit detectors.\n\n1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:47.720\n That's why I love people. A hundred percent.\n\n1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:50.240\n I'll go on a stage and if I'm not in the right head space\n\n1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:52.600\n to be real, it won't be a good show.\n\n1:31:52.600 --> 1:31:54.400\n If I'm real, then it's a good show.\n\n1:31:54.400 --> 1:31:55.460\n It's as simple as that.\n\n1:31:55.460 --> 1:31:56.760\n Let's go through the song.\n\n1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:00.800\n Like I said, great opener.\n\n1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:03.160\n So you had this in your mind,\n\n1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:04.000\n this landscape?\n\n1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:32:11.380 --> 1:32:13.780\n The beat was first on this.\n\n1:32:13.780 --> 1:32:16.120\n What about the first and the second,\n\n1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:17.920\n like first thing's first, second thing's second?\n\n1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:21.140\n The first line I wrote was first thing's first.\n\n1:32:21.140 --> 1:32:23.280\n I don't know why, it just was like,\n\n1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:25.840\n and then I was like, oh, that principle of, you know.\n\n1:32:27.100 --> 1:32:28.080\n Great line.\n\n1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:30.240\n Second thing's second.\n\n1:32:30.240 --> 1:32:33.600\n Don't you tell me what you think that I could be.\n\n1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:35.880\n I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea.\n\n1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.440\n I'm the master of my sea.\n\n1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:39.360\n My dad had that in his office.\n\n1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:44.360\n He had this saying that was something about the sailor\n\n1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:47.960\n and being the master of his sea that I always loved.\n\n1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.840\n There you go, simple statement.\n\n1:32:49.840 --> 1:32:50.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:51.840\n Zero cringe in it.\n\n1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:53.520\n It's so powerful.\n\n1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:55.280\n It's so simple.\n\n1:32:55.280 --> 1:32:56.280\n I'm the master of my sea.\n\n1:32:56.280 --> 1:32:59.600\n This whole song is just trivial,\n\n1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:03.760\n but in terms of lyrically,\n\n1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:06.940\n but extremely powerful and original, unique sounding,\n\n1:33:06.940 --> 1:33:08.420\n something about the words.\n\n1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:10.080\n Just even, you don't have to actually sing them,\n\n1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:11.120\n you just read them.\n\n1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.960\n And then raw, I was broken from a young age,\n\n1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:18.000\n tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems for the few\n\n1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:20.640\n that look at me, took to me, shook at me,\n\n1:33:20.640 --> 1:33:23.000\n feeling me, singing from the heartache, from the pain,\n\n1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:24.760\n taking my message from the thing.\n\n1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:27.520\n I can't, why am I reciting your words to you?\n\n1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:30.660\n But the percussionist throughout it,\n\n1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:34.320\n and that was there in the beginning.\n\n1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:36.280\n The percussion is almost in the lyrics, yeah.\n\n1:33:36.280 --> 1:33:37.640\n And I'm a very percussive singer\n\n1:33:37.640 --> 1:33:40.800\n because I was a drummer first before I,\n\n1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:44.120\n I think same with Dave Grohl, probably a similar thing,\n\n1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:49.120\n which is I think in percussive sense a lot when I'm writing\n\n1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:52.820\n and I also was, before I could play an instrument,\n\n1:33:52.820 --> 1:33:54.160\n I would beatbox.\n\n1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:56.340\n And I think Michael Jackson did this too, actually.\n\n1:33:56.340 --> 1:33:58.520\n I've heard in the studio that he was very similar,\n\n1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:02.360\n but a lot of what I do is percussive\n\n1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:06.500\n because my brain thinks in percussively first.\n\n1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:08.680\n A little more, because it's so good.\n\n1:34:08.680 --> 1:34:09.680\n It's almost like a drum, like,\n\n1:34:09.680 --> 1:34:14.400\n dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka.\n\n1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:16.040\n And then you lay words on that.\n\n1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:18.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:18.920 --> 1:34:19.760\n Yeah, this.\n\n1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:22.760\n Tuck myself into the masses, writing my poems for the few\n\n1:34:22.760 --> 1:34:25.200\n that look at me, took to me, shook at me, feeling me,\n\n1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:30.200\n it's almost like drums, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka, dka.\n\n1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:32.440\n It's all building to the chorus.\n\n1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:39.440\n Hey, you made me a, you made me a believer, believer.\n\n1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:41.080\n Hey, hey.\n\n1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:44.360\n What about the word pain?\n\n1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:46.640\n When did that come to you?\n\n1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:51.400\n Pain, you made me, you made me a believer.\n\n1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:53.040\n Yeah, just the idea of,\n\n1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:57.400\n I just wanted to, I really,\n\n1:34:57.400 --> 1:35:00.400\n one of the things that a lot of the songs that I like,\n\n1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:05.400\n I like divisiveness, for instance, not always,\n\n1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.320\n but there's times where I want someone to hear a song\n\n1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:09.120\n and I want them to either love it or hate it.\n\n1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.600\n I really don't want them to be in the middle ground.\n\n1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:13.360\n A lot of the songs that,\n\n1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:18.280\n like a lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs.\n\n1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:22.480\n And so for instance, with pain,\n\n1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.360\n I want you to hear that in almost like, it's like, whoa.\n\n1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:27.200\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:29.320\n It's something either somebody is going to hear\n\n1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:30.160\n and they'll be like, man,\n\n1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.440\n I just don't want to hear that like that.\n\n1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:33.360\n Or it's like, oh, I felt that so deeply\n\n1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:35.640\n when he said that in that way, because it sounded like this.\n\n1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:38.520\n And when you think of the word pain, it's like,\n\n1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:43.520\n that's a, at least for me, when I hear that word,\n\n1:35:45.360 --> 1:35:48.180\n it carries a lot of weight, carries a lot of weight.\n\n1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:50.520\n So I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight\n\n1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.760\n and to come into that chorus with like,\n\n1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:55.100\n like it's a striking moment.\n\n1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.520\n And I'm also a tenor singing as,\n\n1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:01.280\n sorry, I'm a baritone singing as a tenor.\n\n1:36:01.280 --> 1:36:04.100\n So that's where that natural,\n\n1:36:04.100 --> 1:36:05.880\n like gruffness comes from is that I'm singing\n\n1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.240\n out of my range really, up in my head voice.\n\n1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.080\n And it carries a lot of weight with it\n\n1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:11.320\n because of the baritone.\n\n1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:15.960\n Can I ask you a specific sort of the pause before the pain?\n\n1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:18.500\n It's really interesting.\n\n1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:20.640\n Cause it's like a double.\n\n1:36:20.640 --> 1:36:25.640\n What is that, how much work does that take\n\n1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:28.200\n to get that right?\n\n1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:29.760\n That's incredible.\n\n1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:33.000\n Cause it's like a, so you're kind of seeing the beauty\n\n1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:36.560\n through the, and then that, whatever that sound is.\n\n1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.040\n Right, the bass being rolled off.\n\n1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:39.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:43.240\n Yeah, I actually, when I first was approaching the chorus,\n\n1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:44.720\n it was actually seeing,\n\n1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:48.680\n taking my message from the veins,\n\n1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:49.800\n taking my lesson from the veins,\n\n1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:51.840\n seeing the beauty through the,\n\n1:36:51.840 --> 1:36:53.920\n seeing the beauty through the pain.\n\n1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:56.260\n You made me a, like it came in on one.\n\n1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:59.080\n I'm not seeing it right right now, but it did not wait.\n\n1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:02.440\n And it felt like it didn't hit\n\n1:37:02.440 --> 1:37:04.000\n in the way that it was supposed to hit.\n\n1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.300\n Because the, you predict that, right?\n\n1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:09.200\n You're like, you're waiting to see the beauty\n\n1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:11.080\n through the pain, you made me a, right?\n\n1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:13.320\n It was like the beauty through the pain.\n\n1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:15.200\n You made me a, made me.\n\n1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:17.720\n So I wanted to feel a little more like striking,\n\n1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:19.960\n like, again, it's like that thing that makes you\n\n1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:20.960\n kind of do this a little bit.\n\n1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.160\n You're like, huh?\n\n1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:25.160\n But once you hear it a few times, you're like, ah, ah.\n\n1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:26.320\n And you predict, you know what I mean?\n\n1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:29.200\n It's like, I'd rather someone hear our song the first time\n\n1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:31.320\n and be confused by it.\n\n1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:33.120\n So they play it the second time.\n\n1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:34.440\n And then they're like, oh, okay.\n\n1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:35.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:39.400\n Like, I really don't want, you know,\n\n1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:41.800\n I'd rather turn some people off along the way.\n\n1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:43.560\n And then the people who come along for you\n\n1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:46.960\n are gonna feel more committed, I think.\n\n1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:49.120\n It's just an interesting, like,\n\n1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:53.080\n it feels gutsy to insert silence, you know?\n\n1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:54.240\n Yeah, that's what makes it, you know,\n\n1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:57.080\n it's like the greatest speakers of all time are like,\n\n1:37:57.080 --> 1:37:58.280\n and I told you.\n\n1:37:59.240 --> 1:38:00.760\n Right.\n\n1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:04.280\n You would know, I mean, it's like, you're like, oh.\n\n1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:05.840\n Yeah, what is that?\n\n1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:07.840\n Yeah, that's so interesting to do that\n\n1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:09.080\n just at the right time.\n\n1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:13.480\n And then, and then pain, right?\n\n1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:15.880\n Man, it's a brilliant song.\n\n1:38:15.880 --> 1:38:18.720\n Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it?\n\n1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.800\n Out of the thousands of songs you've written?\n\n1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:23.040\n You know, it's always the same thing for me,\n\n1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:27.080\n which is like, if I wanna listen to the song\n\n1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:29.680\n and I wanna listen to it a lot of times,\n\n1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:31.840\n then those are the songs we put out.\n\n1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:33.560\n And I only wanna listen to the songs\n\n1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:35.040\n that make me feel something.\n\n1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:36.600\n Whether or not it's like,\n\n1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:39.920\n our single that did the very worst of all our singles\n\n1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:42.880\n was the song that I wanted to listen to the least,\n\n1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:45.000\n but it made the most sense as a single,\n\n1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:46.680\n which was all the wrong reason to choose it, right?\n\n1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:50.520\n It was, I Bet My Life is the single off our second album.\n\n1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:51.840\n And that song was originally written,\n\n1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:53.240\n it was just a guitar and a vocal,\n\n1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:56.320\n and it was very just quiet and laid back.\n\n1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.160\n And we were like, well, let's try to dial it up,\n\n1:38:59.160 --> 1:39:00.040\n let's try to produce it.\n\n1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:01.960\n And we overproduced that song.\n\n1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:05.440\n We self produced it as a band and we overproduced.\n\n1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:10.440\n And that song, I mean, it did good in terms of a song,\n\n1:39:10.440 --> 1:39:14.200\n but for us, it did not do good compared to other songs.\n\n1:39:14.200 --> 1:39:15.960\n And I really look back at that\n\n1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:17.160\n and learned a lesson from that.\n\n1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:19.560\n It's like, if I don't wanna listen to the song,\n\n1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:21.880\n that's a sign already.\n\n1:39:21.880 --> 1:39:23.880\n If you don't wanna listen to your own song,\n\n1:39:23.880 --> 1:39:25.040\n it's probably not a good song.\n\n1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:26.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:30.320\n You said your dad, elsewhere and today,\n\n1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:35.320\n just said that your dad early on was a kind of the early\n\n1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:37.120\n Rick Rubin.\n\n1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:38.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:41.880\n So when you were starting out, he gave you feedback,\n\n1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:42.720\n you listened.\n\n1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.000\n What did you learn about music about life from your dad?\n\n1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:53.080\n My dad is a really quiet farm, grew up on a farm,\n\n1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:54.280\n very humble.\n\n1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:59.280\n And I think he starts every sentence by saying,\n\n1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:02.840\n this is just my two cents, pretty much.\n\n1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:03.680\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.240\n It's like, take it or leave it.\n\n1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:06.080\n Like, you know what I mean?\n\n1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:08.240\n He's that kind of a sense, like there's humility\n\n1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:09.960\n in everything and it's real for him.\n\n1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:12.400\n It's not like false humility.\n\n1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:14.160\n I really feel like when he's saying things,\n\n1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:17.480\n he really is like, maybe this isn't any worth to you son.\n\n1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:19.360\n And he means it, but here it is.\n\n1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:20.200\n And it's always gold.\n\n1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:22.600\n And I'm like, wow, dad, that's incredible.\n\n1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:24.880\n So what, in those early days of you like,\n\n1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:26.480\n so you were like 12 or something like that,\n\n1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:27.320\n like starting to write songs.\n\n1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:30.040\n I was 12, I wasn't showing my music to anyone.\n\n1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:31.280\n I started writing right when I was 12\n\n1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:33.120\n and I probably wrote for at least,\n\n1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:34.480\n let's say six months or something.\n\n1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:36.280\n And I had written probably, I don't know,\n\n1:40:36.280 --> 1:40:38.560\n like a lot of songs during that time.\n\n1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:39.640\n What was the topic by the way?\n\n1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:40.480\n Love, anger?\n\n1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:41.960\n It was all sad.\n\n1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:53.320\n No, it was, the first song I ever wrote went,\n\n1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:54.280\n and it was like a bluesy thing.\n\n1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:55.720\n It was like, there was my voice doing that.\n\n1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:56.560\n And then it was like,\n\n1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:01.760\n all by himself, no other one around.\n\n1:41:01.760 --> 1:41:04.440\n And he stood all alone.\n\n1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:07.640\n When would he be found?\n\n1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:10.120\n Did he want company?\n\n1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:13.480\n Or was he fine on his own?\n\n1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:15.920\n Everyone needs a friend.\n\n1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:21.120\n So why was he all alone?\n\n1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.760\n You know, it is like, but I was like a 12 year old with,\n\n1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:28.880\n I just felt like depressed for the first time.\n\n1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:31.560\n And I was, and I just was like, so.\n\n1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:33.040\n I think he discovered the blues as a 12 year old.\n\n1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:34.360\n Yeah, right, right.\n\n1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.080\n It really was, it was like my sense of the blues\n\n1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:38.080\n at that time for sure, like bad version of the blues.\n\n1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:40.920\n But it was like 12 year old kid with a bunch of acne.\n\n1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.880\n And like, I just like, I hated going to school.\n\n1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:46.680\n I felt like that I just had not found myself.\n\n1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:48.000\n Sounds like a great song, by the way.\n\n1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.480\n But anyway, I wanted to keep listening.\n\n1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:50.320\n I forgot I was.\n\n1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:55.160\n Yeah, I don't know about that, but yeah.\n\n1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:56.400\n Yeah, what was your dad,\n\n1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.560\n at which point did you begin to share it with your dad?\n\n1:41:58.560 --> 1:42:00.120\n A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning\n\n1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:02.120\n were very much like Bobby McFerrin like that,\n\n1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:05.240\n because our, Mike was in a part of the house\n\n1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:06.480\n where I couldn't bring over the piano.\n\n1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:07.840\n And the only instrument I played at the time\n\n1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:08.680\n was the piano.\n\n1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:11.120\n So I would do everything with my voice.\n\n1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:13.200\n But then I started teaching myself the guitar\n\n1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:15.200\n in those, in that beginning, like six month period,\n\n1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:17.360\n just watching my brothers play in their garage bands\n\n1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:18.320\n in the basement.\n\n1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:19.280\n And then I started to write songs\n\n1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:20.720\n a little bit more like Enya vibes,\n\n1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:22.920\n like stack my voice like 20, 30 times.\n\n1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:26.320\n And like Enya meets like Jaray,\n\n1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:28.360\n which is who my dad would listen to a lot.\n\n1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:31.280\n John Michael Jaray, he's an incredible synth genius.\n\n1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.280\n But anyway, so I finally got my like gall up enough\n\n1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:38.320\n to show it to my dad one day after work.\n\n1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:39.800\n And I got very little of my dad\n\n1:42:39.800 --> 1:42:41.320\n because there were nine kids and he worked\n\n1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:43.680\n from 8 a.m. till 6 p.m.\n\n1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:44.680\n We'll come home very tired.\n\n1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.320\n And here's nine kids that are like, dad, you know,\n\n1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:48.160\n and you're the young one.\n\n1:42:48.160 --> 1:42:49.480\n You're not, you're just gonna miss.\n\n1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:50.720\n I was in the middle kind of too.\n\n1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:53.360\n So it's even, you know, middle child thing.\n\n1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:54.480\n But I sat him down and I was like,\n\n1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:57.360\n hey dad, I just wanna like kind of show you a song.\n\n1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:58.840\n And he was like, oh, you know,\n\n1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.320\n he didn't know I was writing anything.\n\n1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:02.720\n And I showed it to him and he listened\n\n1:43:02.720 --> 1:43:04.160\n and he took it off and he really looked at me.\n\n1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:06.920\n And he was like, that was really good.\n\n1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:08.640\n He was like, I've thought, and this,\n\n1:43:08.640 --> 1:43:10.440\n when you said this, it made me feel this.\n\n1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:12.040\n He was like, and that did it.\n\n1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:14.320\n I probably would have given up music.\n\n1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:17.520\n Like I look back, that was a very pivotal moment for me.\n\n1:43:17.520 --> 1:43:20.920\n I was like in a place where I was like, is this good, bad?\n\n1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:23.960\n I don't know, maybe it's so embarrassing and terrible.\n\n1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:25.160\n And I was already writing lyrics\n\n1:43:25.160 --> 1:43:27.480\n that were a little like overly metaphorical to hide\n\n1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:29.200\n that I was dealing with faith crisis.\n\n1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:31.240\n Cause I thought, okay, I'm gonna show this to dad.\n\n1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:33.360\n I don't want my dad to know I'm like questioning\n\n1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:35.560\n the truthfulness of Joseph Smith.\n\n1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:38.560\n So I'm not gonna be like, is Joseph Smith a real prophet?\n\n1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:39.760\n Is Mormonism true?\n\n1:43:39.760 --> 1:43:40.600\n I don't really know.\n\n1:43:40.600 --> 1:43:41.440\n Like, you know what I mean?\n\n1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:43.480\n I was like writing way overly metaphorical,\n\n1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:46.000\n but because my dad really validated it\n\n1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:47.840\n and he was a no bullshit person.\n\n1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:50.080\n So I knew when my dad said that, I was like, you know what?\n\n1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:52.400\n At least my dad really actually thinks this is cool.\n\n1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.520\n And I really trusted my dad's taste\n\n1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:56.840\n and thought everything he listened to was cool.\n\n1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:59.120\n So I was like, wow, I'm gonna keep doing this.\n\n1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.080\n And I just showed it to my dad for years and years.\n\n1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:03.160\n And still to this day, I send every song to my dad.\n\n1:44:03.160 --> 1:44:06.520\n So he underneath it with the feedback is always like,\n\n1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:07.480\n Ooh, I like this idea.\n\n1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:08.320\n I like this.\n\n1:44:08.320 --> 1:44:09.160\n It's just a positive, like a.\n\n1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:10.400\n Not always positive, no.\n\n1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:13.000\n But like underneath it, do you sense the positivity?\n\n1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.080\n Cause I think that's. Always.\n\n1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:18.420\n Never mean, never malicious.\n\n1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:21.440\n You know, there's like, there's two types of criticism.\n\n1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:22.840\n There's like criticism that's just like,\n\n1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:24.680\n you're looking to be hurtful to someone.\n\n1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:26.560\n And then there's criticism that's like\n\n1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:28.600\n really important for art.\n\n1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:30.700\n It's the type of criticism that's like,\n\n1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:32.480\n you see the value in what's happening.\n\n1:44:32.480 --> 1:44:34.360\n And if it's honest, then you can,\n\n1:44:34.360 --> 1:44:35.980\n you maybe communicate with that person.\n\n1:44:35.980 --> 1:44:39.280\n Like I, I see what you're trying to do with that.\n\n1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:40.800\n You know, it's not even like you have to say that\n\n1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:42.020\n or whatever, like butter it up.\n\n1:44:42.020 --> 1:44:45.200\n But it's like, my dad would just give me the,\n\n1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:49.320\n this honest criticism that would be like, you know,\n\n1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:51.760\n it certainly wasn't always good,\n\n1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:53.540\n but I knew it was always well intentioned.\n\n1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:55.200\n I guess that's, that's how I would say.\n\n1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:57.260\n You mentioned, made me re listen to it.\n\n1:44:57.260 --> 1:44:58.600\n I'm a big fan of Cass Stevens.\n\n1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:00.640\n You made me re listen to father and son.\n\n1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:03.280\n I probably all sons have issues\n\n1:45:03.280 --> 1:45:05.740\n to work through with their fathers.\n\n1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:10.560\n And you said that you connect with this song in particular.\n\n1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:13.180\n I think, so you're a father now.\n\n1:45:13.180 --> 1:45:16.200\n What is it about the song that connects with you?\n\n1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:19.540\n For people, let me play it, let me play a little bit.\n\n1:45:19.540 --> 1:45:21.940\n People should educate themselves on Cass Stevens.\n\n1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:22.780\n Oh my gosh.\n\n1:45:22.780 --> 1:45:23.620\n Right on the peace train.\n\n1:45:23.620 --> 1:45:27.000\n The best, the best, right on the peace train.\n\n1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.840\n You think this is a hopeful, a sad song?\n\n1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:31.160\n I hear it as hopeful.\n\n1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:33.520\n I hear it as a loving father saying\n\n1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:34.840\n just what his son needs to hear.\n\n1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:38.260\n It's not time to make a change.\n\n1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:42.040\n Just relax, take it easy.\n\n1:45:42.040 --> 1:45:43.920\n You're still young.\n\n1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:45.760\n That's your fault.\n\n1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:47.720\n There's so much you have.\n\n1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:49.400\n It's like that calm wisdom.\n\n1:45:50.600 --> 1:45:51.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:52.260\n This time.\n\n1:45:52.260 --> 1:45:53.100\n It wise.\n\n1:45:53.100 --> 1:45:57.900\n If you want, you can marry, look at me.\n\n1:45:57.900 --> 1:46:01.340\n I am old, but I'm happy.\n\n1:46:01.340 --> 1:46:02.180\n And just the way he says that,\n\n1:46:02.180 --> 1:46:03.180\n like that should be a corny line,\n\n1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:04.220\n but it's not corny at all.\n\n1:46:04.220 --> 1:46:05.060\n It's like.\n\n1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:07.060\n Once like you are now.\n\n1:46:07.060 --> 1:46:09.020\n Look at me, I'm old, but I'm happy.\n\n1:46:09.020 --> 1:46:13.100\n It's not easy to be calm\n\n1:46:13.100 --> 1:46:15.860\n when you found something going on.\n\n1:46:15.860 --> 1:46:17.620\n Yeah, I mean, the simplicity there,\n\n1:46:17.620 --> 1:46:22.620\n and it's such a contrast with, what's his name?\n\n1:46:24.020 --> 1:46:26.340\n Harry Chapman with the cats in the cradle,\n\n1:46:26.340 --> 1:46:31.340\n which is like the sadness of,\n\n1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:38.380\n so this feels like there's a wise,\n\n1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:42.100\n calm connection between father and son, right?\n\n1:46:42.100 --> 1:46:44.540\n With cats in the cradle.\n\n1:46:44.540 --> 1:46:46.500\n I don't know if you remember that song.\n\n1:46:47.620 --> 1:46:49.420\n He learned to walk while I was away\n\n1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:51.900\n and he was talking before I knew it.\n\n1:46:51.900 --> 1:46:54.680\n And as he grew, he'd say, I'm going to be like you dad.\n\n1:46:54.680 --> 1:46:56.020\n You know, I'm going to be like you.\n\n1:46:56.020 --> 1:46:58.620\n And the idea of that song is\n\n1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:00.300\n that he does become like his dad,\n\n1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:03.940\n which is funny, you know, something you've said.\n\n1:47:05.260 --> 1:47:06.460\n But in a different way,\n\n1:47:06.460 --> 1:47:09.260\n you become too busy to make that connection.\n\n1:47:09.260 --> 1:47:12.380\n His dad was too busy to make a connection with his son.\n\n1:47:12.380 --> 1:47:14.380\n And in a, not in a dramatic way,\n\n1:47:14.380 --> 1:47:16.340\n in a very kind of calm, natural way.\n\n1:47:16.340 --> 1:47:18.340\n Like you don't, you just don't have time.\n\n1:47:19.340 --> 1:47:21.980\n You're busy at work, you're providing for the family\n\n1:47:21.980 --> 1:47:23.220\n and so on, there's connection.\n\n1:47:23.220 --> 1:47:24.660\n But if you don't really get,\n\n1:47:24.660 --> 1:47:27.060\n form that like depth of connection.\n\n1:47:27.060 --> 1:47:31.020\n And then the father, when the son shows up from college\n\n1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:31.860\n and all that kind of stuff,\n\n1:47:31.860 --> 1:47:34.060\n he doesn't spend any time with the father.\n\n1:47:34.060 --> 1:47:37.300\n All that, and just the calm sadness of that,\n\n1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:40.340\n that we live, we can live parallel lives\n\n1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:42.100\n and never quite connect.\n\n1:47:42.100 --> 1:47:44.220\n And there is a little bit of that in father and son\n\n1:47:44.220 --> 1:47:45.580\n with Cat Stevens too, you know,\n\n1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:47.380\n like when the son is saying,\n\n1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:51.580\n from the moment that I could talk, I was ordered to listen.\n\n1:47:51.580 --> 1:47:54.060\n I always remember listening to that line,\n\n1:47:54.060 --> 1:47:56.980\n feeling like that really moved me.\n\n1:47:56.980 --> 1:47:59.700\n But the beauty of that song is it shows,\n\n1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:01.860\n it's kind of like the theme of what I feel like\n\n1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:03.500\n we've talked about since the second you got here,\n\n1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:05.020\n which is something I really like.\n\n1:48:05.020 --> 1:48:06.540\n I don't know why it's such an important theme\n\n1:48:06.540 --> 1:48:11.340\n in my life right now, but the duality of just understanding\n\n1:48:11.340 --> 1:48:14.580\n that you don't understand someone else's situation.\n\n1:48:14.580 --> 1:48:16.620\n And there's truth to both sides.\n\n1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:19.140\n Like there's truth to what the father is saying to the son.\n\n1:48:19.140 --> 1:48:20.740\n He's like saying these things and he's like,\n\n1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:23.380\n I'm looking out for you, I love you.\n\n1:48:23.380 --> 1:48:24.460\n Take your time with these things.\n\n1:48:24.460 --> 1:48:26.020\n If you want to get married, you know you can.\n\n1:48:26.020 --> 1:48:27.020\n Like these things will bring you up.\n\n1:48:27.020 --> 1:48:29.500\n And then the son saying, listen,\n\n1:48:29.500 --> 1:48:31.180\n like I want to pave my own path.\n\n1:48:31.180 --> 1:48:32.020\n I want to do this.\n\n1:48:32.020 --> 1:48:33.300\n Like, why are you telling me this?\n\n1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.180\n Like the son's not wrong.\n\n1:48:36.180 --> 1:48:37.540\n Cause there's a lot of parents who tell their kids\n\n1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:40.180\n what to do and they're wrong, you know what I mean?\n\n1:48:40.180 --> 1:48:43.820\n Like, and they don't let the kid form the path\n\n1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:47.380\n that they need to, but should you not be a parent?\n\n1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:48.220\n Like, you know what I mean?\n\n1:48:48.220 --> 1:48:49.060\n There's just two sides to it.\n\n1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:54.060\n There's a thing, it is annoying when you're older,\n\n1:48:54.860 --> 1:48:58.260\n you get to see people do all the same things.\n\n1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:03.260\n You could say, well, this is a phase and you'll see\n\n1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:08.260\n that this actually will end up in this way.\n\n1:49:08.260 --> 1:49:10.260\n You can like predict how the life unrolls.\n\n1:49:10.260 --> 1:49:12.380\n And it's very annoying for young people to hear,\n\n1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:14.020\n especially cause it's probably going to be true.\n\n1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:16.380\n It's like, no, it's not going to be like this.\n\n1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:17.300\n No, I'm going to be different.\n\n1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:18.940\n But then you become that person.\n\n1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:22.660\n But that doesn't mean they also let them live that life.\n\n1:49:22.660 --> 1:49:24.740\n Let them make the mistakes,\n\n1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:26.340\n but they're not mistakes actually.\n\n1:49:26.340 --> 1:49:30.660\n They're like beautiful deviations\n\n1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:34.500\n from the path that they end up on.\n\n1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:36.660\n And those make the path.\n\n1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:43.060\n Do you have advice for young folks today?\n\n1:49:43.060 --> 1:49:48.060\n You've had like an incredible dark journey\n\n1:49:48.060 --> 1:49:51.380\n and a successful one, a loving one,\n\n1:49:52.220 --> 1:49:55.940\n and one of the most successful artists in the world.\n\n1:49:55.940 --> 1:49:58.420\n Is there advice you can give to young people today\n\n1:49:58.420 --> 1:50:01.140\n that would like to find themselves to that way,\n\n1:50:01.140 --> 1:50:02.580\n especially if they're struggling?\n\n1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:04.060\n I thought you said device at first.\n\n1:50:04.060 --> 1:50:05.780\n And I was like, honestly,\n\n1:50:05.780 --> 1:50:07.700\n I feel like that device is not helping.\n\n1:50:07.700 --> 1:50:10.940\n Maybe everybody should get away,\n\n1:50:10.940 --> 1:50:12.820\n throw away their devices.\n\n1:50:12.820 --> 1:50:13.820\n Advice.\n\n1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:18.820\n I would just say like what I emphasize to my kids\n\n1:50:20.580 --> 1:50:24.580\n is I really, really want my kids\n\n1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:27.260\n to just learn to love themself.\n\n1:50:27.260 --> 1:50:29.820\n It's easier said than done.\n\n1:50:29.820 --> 1:50:32.260\n It's really easy to pick on yourself in life.\n\n1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:35.860\n It's really easy to look in the mirror\n\n1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:37.540\n and wish you looked different,\n\n1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:41.300\n wish you were more successful like that person over there,\n\n1:50:41.300 --> 1:50:44.660\n wish that, you know, wish a lot of things.\n\n1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:50.580\n And people that I see that really succeed at life\n\n1:50:52.100 --> 1:50:53.580\n really succeed truly.\n\n1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:55.740\n And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily\n\n1:50:55.740 --> 1:50:56.620\n or they're succeeding.\n\n1:50:56.620 --> 1:50:58.620\n And, you know, they're talking to a lot of people\n\n1:50:58.620 --> 1:51:03.300\n like their success, success to me is like happy\n\n1:51:03.300 --> 1:51:06.140\n and real, they have real self love.\n\n1:51:06.140 --> 1:51:07.700\n You meet, you know, when you meet someone,\n\n1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:10.700\n you meet Rick, for instance, you meet Rick Rubin.\n\n1:51:10.700 --> 1:51:12.180\n Rick has a calmness about him.\n\n1:51:12.180 --> 1:51:13.620\n And it's funny because everybody sees him\n\n1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.460\n as this like Zen master.\n\n1:51:16.460 --> 1:51:21.460\n Like Rick is just a really loving person\n\n1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:24.820\n who also loves himself and has self confidence\n\n1:51:24.820 --> 1:51:26.940\n because you just see it and it resonates.\n\n1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:28.060\n And that's why he draws people.\n\n1:51:28.060 --> 1:51:29.380\n And that's why he's so great in the studio\n\n1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:31.740\n because you know his intentions, always.\n\n1:51:31.740 --> 1:51:33.900\n As an artist, when a producer comes in, you're like,\n\n1:51:33.900 --> 1:51:35.940\n whoa, whoa, whoa, what are your intentions?\n\n1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:36.780\n What are you trying to do?\n\n1:51:36.780 --> 1:51:38.460\n Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label?\n\n1:51:38.460 --> 1:51:40.020\n Are you trying to make me something?\n\n1:51:40.020 --> 1:51:41.340\n Are you trying to like make me this\n\n1:51:41.340 --> 1:51:42.660\n so you can prove this about yourself?\n\n1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:44.740\n Like there's a lot in that dynamic.\n\n1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:47.420\n And the reason that Rick is so good is because\n\n1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:50.460\n you know his intentions and his intentions come\n\n1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:52.020\n because Rick has that self love.\n\n1:51:52.020 --> 1:51:56.300\n So for me, find the things about yourself\n\n1:51:56.300 --> 1:51:58.580\n because they're there that you love\n\n1:51:59.580 --> 1:52:01.700\n and really focus in on them.\n\n1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:02.740\n And it's not selfish.\n\n1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:05.140\n Like I feel like I was brought up in a family too\n\n1:52:05.140 --> 1:52:09.940\n where it was like, never look inward, like be selfless.\n\n1:52:09.940 --> 1:52:11.340\n Like serve, serve, serve.\n\n1:52:11.340 --> 1:52:14.220\n Which by the way, is a true principle of life.\n\n1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:16.420\n I think you love yourself more when you serve more.\n\n1:52:16.420 --> 1:52:19.140\n I think that's really evident in life.\n\n1:52:19.140 --> 1:52:22.660\n But also spend time doing the things that make you happy.\n\n1:52:22.660 --> 1:52:24.380\n Take time every day to go on that walk\n\n1:52:24.380 --> 1:52:25.660\n that you need to go on.\n\n1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:28.060\n Listen to that book tape that you need to listen to.\n\n1:52:28.060 --> 1:52:29.940\n Like for me, that's something I need.\n\n1:52:29.940 --> 1:52:31.700\n I know if I do that, I'm gonna be a better dad\n\n1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:36.380\n because I gave myself some love back in life.\n\n1:52:37.420 --> 1:52:39.740\n And just forgive yourself.\n\n1:52:39.740 --> 1:52:42.020\n I think forgive yourself because everybody messes up.\n\n1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:43.340\n Everybody hurts others.\n\n1:52:43.340 --> 1:52:45.500\n Everybody says unkind words at times.\n\n1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:49.740\n Everybody fails all the time.\n\n1:52:49.740 --> 1:52:52.940\n And if you think that you're gonna not, you're wrong.\n\n1:52:52.940 --> 1:52:54.020\n And you're eventually going to\n\n1:52:54.020 --> 1:52:56.700\n and you're either gonna punish yourself for it every day\n\n1:52:56.700 --> 1:52:59.380\n and be a lesser version of what you could be\n\n1:52:59.380 --> 1:53:01.540\n or you're gonna forgive yourself for it.\n\n1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:03.340\n And if you learned that that's not something you want\n\n1:53:03.340 --> 1:53:04.460\n then try not to do it again.\n\n1:53:04.460 --> 1:53:06.620\n If you do it again and you're probably gonna do it again,\n\n1:53:06.620 --> 1:53:09.260\n whatever that is, you're gonna gossip about that person.\n\n1:53:09.260 --> 1:53:10.100\n You're gonna feel bad\n\n1:53:10.100 --> 1:53:12.340\n because then you gossiped about someone.\n\n1:53:12.340 --> 1:53:14.980\n Is there something you could say in terms of self love?\n\n1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:17.660\n Is there a role for being critical?\n\n1:53:17.660 --> 1:53:20.540\n Like those demons of self criticism,\n\n1:53:20.540 --> 1:53:21.780\n do you need a little bit of that?\n\n1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:23.100\n Tom Waits talks about,\n\n1:53:23.100 --> 1:53:25.420\n I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.\n\n1:53:25.420 --> 1:53:27.420\n Need a little poison?\n\n1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:29.460\n Or is that silly?\n\n1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:31.020\n Or a mental situation of poison?\n\n1:53:31.020 --> 1:53:35.140\n Look, my biggest thing in life that has been\n\n1:53:35.140 --> 1:53:36.660\n the thing that I've worked on the hardest\n\n1:53:36.660 --> 1:53:40.140\n for the last few years is to not be overly critical.\n\n1:53:42.540 --> 1:53:45.860\n And to let go of control.\n\n1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:50.860\n I think it's really easy to kill an artist.\n\n1:53:53.340 --> 1:53:55.100\n It's really easy to kill an artist.\n\n1:53:55.100 --> 1:53:58.020\n Like if my dad would have sat down with me that day\n\n1:53:58.020 --> 1:54:01.420\n and even if he would have just sat down and been like,\n\n1:54:01.420 --> 1:54:02.740\n good job son, okay.\n\n1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:03.580\n It's not silly, right?\n\n1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:05.620\n Like I didn't, not everybody has a dad\n\n1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:07.540\n who's gonna ever do something\n\n1:54:07.540 --> 1:54:09.220\n or put in the time or whatever.\n\n1:54:09.220 --> 1:54:14.220\n But that might've altered everything for me.\n\n1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:16.220\n Like my dad taking the extra time\n\n1:54:16.220 --> 1:54:19.340\n to just give me a thoughtful response opposed to,\n\n1:54:19.340 --> 1:54:21.580\n kids know, kids know when you're just like\n\n1:54:21.580 --> 1:54:23.060\n trying to get out of the room or whatever.\n\n1:54:23.060 --> 1:54:25.820\n I knew he wasn't and that did a lot.\n\n1:54:25.820 --> 1:54:26.660\n So yeah.\n\n1:54:26.660 --> 1:54:30.740\n But is that a huge, isn't that what makes the artist?\n\n1:54:30.740 --> 1:54:34.700\n It's the fragility of it that like,\n\n1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:36.300\n would you have it any other way?\n\n1:54:37.700 --> 1:54:40.060\n No, no, I agree with you.\n\n1:54:40.060 --> 1:54:45.060\n I think that that's what, that's the beauty of art.\n\n1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:48.740\n But I think also on the same token, it's like,\n\n1:54:51.620 --> 1:54:54.460\n I went to Music Cares recently,\n\n1:54:54.460 --> 1:54:56.860\n which is a charity for musicians\n\n1:54:56.860 --> 1:54:58.340\n that are down on their luck.\n\n1:54:58.340 --> 1:54:59.780\n That maybe were successful at one point\n\n1:54:59.780 --> 1:55:00.940\n or have never been successful\n\n1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:02.380\n and they can't even pay the bills\n\n1:55:02.380 --> 1:55:05.420\n and this charity contributes money to these artists,\n\n1:55:05.420 --> 1:55:08.380\n aspiring artists or artists who've had drug issues.\n\n1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:09.780\n And like, there's a lot that they do,\n\n1:55:09.780 --> 1:55:11.500\n but, and there was a statistic\n\n1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:12.740\n that they told it was staggering to me,\n\n1:55:12.740 --> 1:55:17.740\n which is, I think it was 75% of artists, musicians,\n\n1:55:17.820 --> 1:55:20.540\n say they struggle with severe depression.\n\n1:55:20.540 --> 1:55:22.180\n That's really high.\n\n1:55:22.180 --> 1:55:24.260\n I don't know what the national average is,\n\n1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:27.460\n but I would guess that that's higher than national average\n\n1:55:27.460 --> 1:55:29.180\n per occupation.\n\n1:55:29.180 --> 1:55:33.020\n So I just think there's a tricky balance.\n\n1:55:33.020 --> 1:55:36.300\n There's a tricky balance in art.\n\n1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:42.020\n So yeah, of course, like it's a necessary thing,\n\n1:55:42.020 --> 1:55:44.420\n the fragility of it all, but.\n\n1:55:46.220 --> 1:55:49.700\n Yeah, I wonder, cause I'm extremely self critical\n\n1:55:49.700 --> 1:55:52.020\n and I sometimes ask myself the question,\n\n1:55:53.540 --> 1:55:58.460\n I've romanticized it or rather I've learned to be,\n\n1:55:58.460 --> 1:56:01.820\n for it to be productive, to channel it into productivity.\n\n1:56:01.820 --> 1:56:05.300\n But I wonder if there's better ways to do that.\n\n1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:07.620\n And I also wonder if it's eventually the thing\n\n1:56:07.620 --> 1:56:08.780\n that destroys me.\n\n1:56:08.780 --> 1:56:11.620\n Like if longterm, if it's a healthy thing,\n\n1:56:11.620 --> 1:56:14.780\n it might be useful when you're sort of\n\n1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:20.980\n actively fighting the battles of the day,\n\n1:56:20.980 --> 1:56:22.420\n for me it's engineering challenges\n\n1:56:22.420 --> 1:56:23.780\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:56:23.780 --> 1:56:28.100\n But then when you're sitting back and enjoying life\n\n1:56:28.100 --> 1:56:30.700\n with family and so on, is that going to be,\n\n1:56:30.700 --> 1:56:32.860\n like, do you need to find that self love,\n\n1:56:32.860 --> 1:56:37.860\n like ability to kind of silence the voice of criticism\n\n1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:39.540\n in your head?\n\n1:56:39.540 --> 1:56:41.380\n You know what, I really, there's a good,\n\n1:56:41.380 --> 1:56:42.500\n you're making a good point.\n\n1:56:42.500 --> 1:56:47.020\n And I think that the middle ground is you need,\n\n1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:55.940\n you need self doubt to push you to be better.\n\n1:56:55.940 --> 1:56:58.780\n I do believe that like, for instance,\n\n1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:02.820\n if I believed I've hit my, like when you're like,\n\n1:57:02.820 --> 1:57:04.980\n is there a song on there that you think is genius?\n\n1:57:04.980 --> 1:57:07.380\n If I think I've written a genius song ever,\n\n1:57:07.380 --> 1:57:09.420\n I think I'd probably stop.\n\n1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:11.740\n I think I'd be like, you know what?\n\n1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:16.340\n Did it, I wrote, what's that perfect song?\n\n1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:21.540\n Imagine.\n\n1:57:21.540 --> 1:57:22.380\n Imagine, yeah.\n\n1:57:22.380 --> 1:57:26.980\n If I'd written imagine, I'd probably be like, that's it,\n\n1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:28.940\n did it, all right, perfect song has been written.\n\n1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:31.180\n That's the best thing I'll ever do.\n\n1:57:31.180 --> 1:57:36.180\n So the fact that there is like self criticism\n\n1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:39.780\n and criticism outside, I think is necessary.\n\n1:57:39.780 --> 1:57:41.100\n A hundred percent for sure.\n\n1:57:41.100 --> 1:57:44.180\n It pushes you, it pushes you, it pushes you.\n\n1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:47.620\n It's just finding the right middle ground\n\n1:57:47.620 --> 1:57:51.660\n for that young aspiring artist to also not feel squashed\n\n1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.700\n and to be heard and to love,\n\n1:57:53.700 --> 1:57:56.920\n just to not even to feel squashed, just to love themself.\n\n1:57:56.920 --> 1:57:59.940\n So that when they're in the room playing the song,\n\n1:57:59.940 --> 1:58:03.260\n they'll believe it because they believe themself.\n\n1:58:03.260 --> 1:58:05.100\n They love themself enough that they believe it\n\n1:58:05.100 --> 1:58:06.060\n and then they'll do a great,\n\n1:58:06.060 --> 1:58:07.500\n and then the song will come out great\n\n1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:10.020\n and they'll do a great performance.\n\n1:58:10.020 --> 1:58:14.980\n I have to ask, it's one of the very interesting aspects\n\n1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:18.500\n of your life of the way you put love out there in the world.\n\n1:58:18.500 --> 1:58:22.480\n What is at the core of your support for the LGBT community?\n\n1:58:23.820 --> 1:58:24.660\n A couple of things.\n\n1:58:24.660 --> 1:58:29.340\n So one, growing up in, from a young age\n\n1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:30.720\n in the artist community,\n\n1:58:31.660 --> 1:58:34.940\n a lot of my closest friends were LGBTQ,\n\n1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:36.240\n starting in middle school.\n\n1:58:38.100 --> 1:58:41.340\n And I think a lot of the best artists in the world\n\n1:58:41.340 --> 1:58:44.620\n are LGBTQ and that's just, it's not a secret.\n\n1:58:44.620 --> 1:58:47.500\n Like it just is, like the artist community is filled\n\n1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:50.860\n with lots of LGBTQ people.\n\n1:58:50.860 --> 1:58:53.620\n So I think being raised in that community\n\n1:58:54.580 --> 1:58:58.100\n in that my friends struggled with their faith\n\n1:58:58.100 --> 1:59:03.100\n and their sexuality really opened up my eyes\n\n1:59:03.340 --> 1:59:08.300\n to how incredibly hard that path is.\n\n1:59:08.300 --> 1:59:10.980\n For instance, okay, when I was in high school,\n\n1:59:10.980 --> 1:59:13.200\n there was someone who went in front of,\n\n1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:17.920\n who was LGBTQ and was Mormon\n\n1:59:17.920 --> 1:59:21.640\n and felt like there was not a place for them in the church.\n\n1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:24.240\n They felt like the path, when you're being told\n\n1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:26.600\n that it's evil and you believe it\n\n1:59:26.600 --> 1:59:28.680\n because you believe in your faith\n\n1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:31.300\n and you feel like it's unchangeable,\n\n1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:32.980\n you're putting a kid in a situation\n\n1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:36.060\n where there's really no good resolution.\n\n1:59:36.060 --> 1:59:39.020\n It's either be alone for the rest of your life\n\n1:59:39.020 --> 1:59:41.300\n or marry outside your sexual preference,\n\n1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.000\n which I don't wanna marry a man.\n\n1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.120\n Like if I was forced to marry a man,\n\n1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:47.480\n I'm like, I don't want to marry a man\n\n1:59:47.480 --> 1:59:49.500\n because I'm heterosexual.\n\n1:59:49.500 --> 1:59:51.920\n So you're forcing a kid into a situation\n\n1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:54.160\n where it's very dangerous.\n\n1:59:54.160 --> 1:59:55.360\n Long story short, this kid went in front\n\n1:59:55.360 --> 1:59:58.360\n of the Las Vegas Mormon temple and shot himself,\n\n1:59:58.360 --> 1:59:59.200\n killed himself.\n\n2:00:00.240 --> 2:00:01.920\n That impacted our community.\n\n2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:06.840\n Like, and not just that, but it was like severe bullying\n\n2:00:06.840 --> 2:00:10.480\n to LGBTQ kids in the 90s, it was especially different.\n\n2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:12.580\n Like there's still bullying, don't get me wrong,\n\n2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.160\n but man, like bullying in school,\n\n2:00:14.160 --> 2:00:16.380\n I don't really know actually what it's like in schools now.\n\n2:00:16.380 --> 2:00:18.720\n Maybe the bullying is just as bad as it was in the 90s,\n\n2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:23.080\n but there was like, it was like,\n\n2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:27.520\n I would hear all the time, like the F slur being slung out\n\n2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:30.960\n at people who were LGBTQ all the time\n\n2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:33.980\n and I wasn't even LGBTQ.\n\n2:00:33.980 --> 2:00:38.980\n So I, you know, it's just seeing that,\n\n2:00:38.980 --> 2:00:43.980\n I think that every, any social justice issue\n\n2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:48.840\n takes all sides.\n\n2:00:48.840 --> 2:00:50.480\n It takes all pieces of the puzzle.\n\n2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:53.000\n If only the pieces of the puzzle contributed\n\n2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:54.680\n are from the side that is affected,\n\n2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:57.240\n I don't believe that we'll ever have resolution.\n\n2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:01.000\n We're doing a shit job and we need to do better.\n\n2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:05.560\n And that's just, that's the reality of it.\n\n2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:07.240\n So that was part of the reason I also have family\n\n2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:09.960\n who's LGBTQ and it's just something\n\n2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:12.460\n that's been part of my path.\n\n2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:14.480\n And I feel like I'm a big believer\n\n2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:16.920\n and take the path that is presented to you.\n\n2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:18.960\n And this was just something that came up in my life a lot.\n\n2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:21.120\n When I met my wife, she was living with her two best friends\n\n2:01:21.120 --> 2:01:24.400\n who were LGBTQ who really didn't want her to marry me\n\n2:01:24.400 --> 2:01:25.320\n because I was Mormon.\n\n2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:27.160\n And at the time it was prop eight,\n\n2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:31.660\n which was Mormons were fighting against LGBT gay marriage.\n\n2:01:31.660 --> 2:01:35.880\n And so that, then they didn't come to our wedding\n\n2:01:35.880 --> 2:01:38.000\n and that really broke my wife's heart.\n\n2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:41.880\n So it was just like, because Mormonism represented everything\n\n2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:45.840\n that was against their community.\n\n2:01:45.840 --> 2:01:46.680\n So.\n\n2:01:46.680 --> 2:01:48.240\n So you felt you had to say something.\n\n2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:50.680\n Yeah, I felt like by not saying anything,\n\n2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:52.220\n I was saying everything.\n\n2:01:52.220 --> 2:01:55.360\n I felt like by not speaking up and being like,\n\n2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.240\n hey, Dan Reynolds is Mormon singer.\n\n2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:01.120\n Here's this new band, Magic Dragons and they're Mormons.\n\n2:02:01.120 --> 2:02:03.520\n It was like, okay, well, what do Mormons represent?\n\n2:02:03.520 --> 2:02:04.880\n They represent prop eight.\n\n2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:06.320\n What does prop eight represent?\n\n2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:09.480\n Bigotry towards the LGBTQ community.\n\n2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:10.320\n So what do I do?\n\n2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:12.180\n Okay, I can speak in every interview and be like,\n\n2:02:12.180 --> 2:02:13.080\n well, that's not me.\n\n2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:15.160\n I don't believe that too.\n\n2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:17.780\n Or I could just be more active about it.\n\n2:02:17.780 --> 2:02:19.800\n And especially when it's affecting my family\n\n2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:21.640\n and friends throughout my entire life, it was like,\n\n2:02:21.640 --> 2:02:25.040\n all right, this seems like a path that you need to go down.\n\n2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:29.240\n So long story short is a path that just presented itself\n\n2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:30.720\n through things in my life.\n\n2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:33.500\n So just on that topic that religion and God\n\n2:02:33.500 --> 2:02:35.840\n give a lot of meaning to a lot of people.\n\n2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:40.080\n It gives a tradition that brings people together\n\n2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:46.180\n across the generations, but it also can hurt people.\n\n2:02:47.460 --> 2:02:50.560\n What do you make about that tension?\n\n2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:54.740\n So source of meaning, but also a source of pain for people.\n\n2:02:56.200 --> 2:02:58.440\n The reality is, at least to me,\n\n2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:00.640\n again, this is just my reality.\n\n2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:01.880\n I feel like I'm doing my dad's thing\n\n2:03:01.880 --> 2:03:03.080\n every time I'm talking to him.\n\n2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:05.720\n Or I'm like, I don't really know, here's my two cents.\n\n2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:06.880\n You have become your father.\n\n2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:07.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:10.040 --> 2:03:12.800\n The reality and it's my reality and it is the reality\n\n2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:17.800\n for sure is there's, I think that religion\n\n2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:24.460\n has brought a lot of hurt and pain to a lot of people.\n\n2:03:24.460 --> 2:03:26.360\n Absolutely it has.\n\n2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:29.060\n I don't think anybody can dispute that on either side,\n\n2:03:29.060 --> 2:03:34.060\n whether it's war, whether it's slaughtering\n\n2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:40.780\n of entire peoples, there's been a lot of pain\n\n2:03:40.780 --> 2:03:42.940\n and suffering that has come from religion.\n\n2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:46.640\n So my little thing that has been hard for me\n\n2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:47.820\n is a faith crisis, right?\n\n2:03:47.820 --> 2:03:50.860\n I had religion and then I lost it and then I had nothing.\n\n2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:52.060\n So that's for me, I was like,\n\n2:03:52.060 --> 2:03:53.960\n well, religion did that to me, right?\n\n2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:58.060\n But then at one point it's kind of like,\n\n2:03:58.060 --> 2:03:59.980\n how much of my life am I just gonna complain\n\n2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:04.460\n about being raised Mormon or being depressed?\n\n2:04:04.460 --> 2:04:07.940\n As I get older, I'm like, okay, so what?\n\n2:04:07.940 --> 2:04:09.260\n Okay, it's really hurt me,\n\n2:04:09.260 --> 2:04:12.780\n but were there any good things that came out of Mormonism?\n\n2:04:12.780 --> 2:04:14.180\n Well, yeah, there's a lot of good things\n\n2:04:14.180 --> 2:04:16.740\n that have come to my family through Mormonism.\n\n2:04:16.740 --> 2:04:18.540\n Closeness, we're really, really close.\n\n2:04:18.540 --> 2:04:21.580\n Mormon culture is that you live together forever, right?\n\n2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:24.320\n The teaching is that your families are forever.\n\n2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:25.820\n We die and then we go to heaven together\n\n2:04:25.820 --> 2:04:27.000\n and we're together forever.\n\n2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.080\n My family really believes that principle, all of them do.\n\n2:04:31.460 --> 2:04:35.280\n And that instills a certain way of living\n\n2:04:35.280 --> 2:04:38.160\n that's kind of beautiful, even if it's naivety.\n\n2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:40.260\n There's something kind of beautiful\n\n2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:42.980\n about believing that we're forming these bonds together\n\n2:04:42.980 --> 2:04:44.220\n as a family and that like,\n\n2:04:44.220 --> 2:04:46.220\n we're gonna be together forever.\n\n2:04:46.220 --> 2:04:48.140\n It brings a lot of comfort to a kid too.\n\n2:04:48.140 --> 2:04:50.580\n When I was little, I was like, wow,\n\n2:04:50.580 --> 2:04:51.700\n it's gonna be okay if I die\n\n2:04:51.700 --> 2:04:53.860\n because I get to see my mom again, you know what I mean?\n\n2:04:53.860 --> 2:04:55.940\n I really believe that.\n\n2:04:55.940 --> 2:04:58.240\n Is the right answer that you tell that kid,\n\n2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:01.980\n actually when you die, you're not gonna see your mom again.\n\n2:05:01.980 --> 2:05:04.420\n Maybe, it might be, I don't know.\n\n2:05:04.420 --> 2:05:08.340\n And anybody who has a kid is gonna face that moment.\n\n2:05:08.340 --> 2:05:10.060\n I've already faced it where you sit down\n\n2:05:10.060 --> 2:05:12.060\n and my kid was like, hey dad,\n\n2:05:12.060 --> 2:05:14.300\n when you die, am I gonna see you again?\n\n2:05:14.300 --> 2:05:16.720\n That was actually a really hard moment for me\n\n2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:18.980\n because I was suddenly faced with,\n\n2:05:18.980 --> 2:05:22.900\n okay, do I give the answer that I thought was bullshit?\n\n2:05:22.900 --> 2:05:25.140\n Or do I give the answer of what I think it is?\n\n2:05:25.140 --> 2:05:29.200\n Or do I give the real answer, which is, I don't know.\n\n2:05:29.200 --> 2:05:30.680\n And that's what I chose,\n\n2:05:30.680 --> 2:05:33.220\n which as a father, that's not always the easiest answer\n\n2:05:33.220 --> 2:05:35.260\n because your kid, it's a wonderful thing\n\n2:05:35.260 --> 2:05:37.580\n that you feel like you can give your kid the comfort of like,\n\n2:05:37.580 --> 2:05:40.060\n hey, your parents are gonna take care of everything.\n\n2:05:40.060 --> 2:05:41.220\n We know everything.\n\n2:05:41.220 --> 2:05:42.060\n We've been around.\n\n2:05:42.060 --> 2:05:43.500\n My kid's always like, are you the strongest?\n\n2:05:43.500 --> 2:05:45.100\n I'm like, yeah, I am the strongest.\n\n2:05:45.100 --> 2:05:46.620\n I'm stronger than everybody.\n\n2:05:46.620 --> 2:05:48.900\n Yeah, I'm stronger than everybody.\n\n2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:51.140\n So when you're faced with that moment,\n\n2:05:51.140 --> 2:05:54.020\n it's like, it kind of sucks to tell your kid like,\n\n2:05:54.020 --> 2:05:55.460\n you know what?\n\n2:05:55.460 --> 2:05:58.140\n I don't know if you're gonna see me after I die,\n\n2:05:58.140 --> 2:05:59.780\n but I hope.\n\n2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:01.940\n That's why I said, I was like, I don't know, but I hope.\n\n2:06:01.940 --> 2:06:02.980\n I really hope,\n\n2:06:02.980 --> 2:06:06.260\n because that would be awesome if we can hang out forever.\n\n2:06:06.260 --> 2:06:07.860\n And if there's any way for it to happen,\n\n2:06:07.860 --> 2:06:08.980\n I'll make it happen.\n\n2:06:08.980 --> 2:06:09.820\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:06:09.820 --> 2:06:11.660\n That's kind of what my answer was.\n\n2:06:11.660 --> 2:06:13.260\n So long story short,\n\n2:06:13.260 --> 2:06:15.740\n sorry, I know that I'm being lengthy on this.\n\n2:06:15.740 --> 2:06:18.260\n Is there like, what is my thought on religion?\n\n2:06:18.260 --> 2:06:19.260\n It just is.\n\n2:06:19.260 --> 2:06:20.700\n It's been here forever.\n\n2:06:20.700 --> 2:06:22.100\n It's coping.\n\n2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:24.980\n Maybe it's, I can't say whether it's true or false.\n\n2:06:24.980 --> 2:06:27.420\n How the hell am I supposed to know?\n\n2:06:27.420 --> 2:06:28.260\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:06:28.260 --> 2:06:31.980\n Like I've lived 34 years on this planet.\n\n2:06:31.980 --> 2:06:34.140\n A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me\n\n2:06:34.140 --> 2:06:35.900\n and they really believe very deeply.\n\n2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:37.900\n And a lot of them are smarter than me.\n\n2:06:37.900 --> 2:06:38.740\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:06:38.740 --> 2:06:40.180\n Like I look at my older brothers, for instance,\n\n2:06:40.180 --> 2:06:43.020\n who are very practicing Mormons.\n\n2:06:43.020 --> 2:06:45.420\n These guys are hyper intelligent.\n\n2:06:45.420 --> 2:06:47.660\n My younger sister, hyper intelligent.\n\n2:06:47.660 --> 2:06:49.300\n All of them start smarter than me.\n\n2:06:49.300 --> 2:06:50.340\n They all believe it still.\n\n2:06:50.340 --> 2:06:52.460\n So what am I supposed to say?\n\n2:06:52.460 --> 2:06:53.820\n Well, you're all stupid.\n\n2:06:53.820 --> 2:06:54.660\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:06:54.660 --> 2:06:55.740\n Like you're all wrong.\n\n2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:56.580\n I don't know.\n\n2:06:56.580 --> 2:06:58.380\n Like maybe it's the South Park episode\n\n2:06:58.380 --> 2:07:00.500\n where everybody dies and then they're like,\n\n2:07:00.500 --> 2:07:02.540\n well, the right answer was Mormonism.\n\n2:07:02.540 --> 2:07:03.860\n And everybody's like, aww.\n\n2:07:03.860 --> 2:07:04.700\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:07:04.700 --> 2:07:08.220\n Like Mormons love that moment in South Park.\n\n2:07:08.220 --> 2:07:09.900\n They're like, hey, that day may come.\n\n2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:12.140\n That day may come.\n\n2:07:13.060 --> 2:07:16.700\n Yeah, so maybe I don't know is the honest answer\n\n2:07:16.700 --> 2:07:18.980\n for everybody around the table.\n\n2:07:18.980 --> 2:07:20.780\n But the biggest question\n\n2:07:20.780 --> 2:07:23.300\n for which I don't know is the right answer\n\n2:07:23.300 --> 2:07:26.340\n is what's the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n2:07:26.340 --> 2:07:27.700\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:07:29.820 --> 2:07:32.180\n No, you're not allowed to say I don't know.\n\n2:07:32.180 --> 2:07:33.380\n Okay.\n\n2:07:33.380 --> 2:07:36.500\n You can be just like your dad and say,\n\n2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:38.700\n let me just give my two cents.\n\n2:07:38.700 --> 2:07:40.100\n Take it or leave it.\n\n2:07:40.100 --> 2:07:41.660\n Whatever it's worth, take it or leave it.\n\n2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:42.500\n It's probably worth nothing.\n\n2:07:42.500 --> 2:07:44.660\n It's piddled on the ground.\n\n2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:49.660\n I mean, why are we here?\n\n2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:55.500\n It's just busily creating all these kinds of things,\n\n2:07:55.500 --> 2:07:57.820\n worrying about things, having kids.\n\n2:07:59.300 --> 2:08:01.580\n My purpose, at least right now,\n\n2:08:03.140 --> 2:08:08.140\n is to wake up and try to\n\n2:08:08.140 --> 2:08:13.140\n to bring light love to the world,\n\n2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:18.820\n light love to myself and have integrity.\n\n2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:21.160\n That's my purpose.\n\n2:08:24.460 --> 2:08:27.100\n The ultimate purpose of life,\n\n2:08:27.100 --> 2:08:29.340\n that I guess that's my ultimate purpose of life.\n\n2:08:29.340 --> 2:08:32.660\n I don't know what happens when I die.\n\n2:08:33.660 --> 2:08:37.180\n Ayahuasca gave me some sense that there's more to be known.\n\n2:08:37.180 --> 2:08:38.700\n I'm sure there are other things in life\n\n2:08:38.700 --> 2:08:41.180\n that would give me that, and I'm looking for it.\n\n2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.020\n I'm a seeker.\n\n2:08:42.020 --> 2:08:46.060\n I'm always looking for the next something\n\n2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.660\n to give me hope in something more,\n\n2:08:48.660 --> 2:08:51.500\n even if so, I could just not bullshit my kids\n\n2:08:51.500 --> 2:08:52.780\n when they ask me that question and be like,\n\n2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:56.220\n you know what, I really don't know.\n\n2:08:56.220 --> 2:08:59.900\n I wanna not know more, if that makes sense.\n\n2:08:59.900 --> 2:09:04.900\n I don't wanna, I want to see things that make me confused,\n\n2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:08.300\n that make me question what I already knew.\n\n2:09:08.300 --> 2:09:13.300\n Like I am like, when I meet an atheist who comes up to me\n\n2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:16.500\n and they're like, atheism, atheism, atheism.\n\n2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:19.700\n It's just as laughable to me as when I meet the Mormon\n\n2:09:19.700 --> 2:09:20.700\n who comes up and they're like,\n\n2:09:20.700 --> 2:09:22.220\n Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism.\n\n2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:26.980\n I'm like, how do you, how do anyone, how do you guys know?\n\n2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:31.700\n They'd like, like, you know.\n\n2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:35.700\n So you feel like you're doing some, through all your travels,\n\n2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:36.980\n through all the people you meet,\n\n2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:38.940\n you feel like you're still keeping your eyes open\n\n2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:43.940\n and your heart open to sort of discover something new,\n\n2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:47.020\n like the ayahuasca experience,\n\n2:09:47.020 --> 2:09:50.580\n that there might be deeper truths out there.\n\n2:09:50.580 --> 2:09:52.460\n Yeah, and I wanna find them,\n\n2:09:52.460 --> 2:09:54.060\n and I wanna surround myself with people\n\n2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:55.220\n who are just looking for it.\n\n2:09:55.220 --> 2:09:57.940\n I'm not interested in people who are just looking\n\n2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:00.500\n to point fingers at each, like life is so short.\n\n2:10:00.500 --> 2:10:02.980\n I'm looking for, it's one of the reasons\n\n2:10:02.980 --> 2:10:05.740\n that I wanna meet with you is I was like, wow,\n\n2:10:05.740 --> 2:10:08.060\n Lex really seems like he's on a journey to find truth.\n\n2:10:08.060 --> 2:10:10.340\n And that humility for me is same thing with Rick.\n\n2:10:10.340 --> 2:10:11.180\n It drew me to Rick.\n\n2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:15.140\n It was like, I really, I see that and identify with it.\n\n2:10:15.140 --> 2:10:16.260\n And that's what I'm looking for.\n\n2:10:16.260 --> 2:10:18.140\n There's the final song on our record,\n\n2:10:18.140 --> 2:10:19.860\n our new record that's coming out.\n\n2:10:20.900 --> 2:10:24.460\n The chorus goes, and this is like,\n\n2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:27.260\n this is my best answer to what you're asking.\n\n2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:30.900\n So the chorus goes,\n\n2:10:30.900 --> 2:10:33.300\n take it easy on me.\n\n2:10:33.300 --> 2:10:35.780\n I need some lullaby.\n\n2:10:35.780 --> 2:10:38.540\n They tell me heaven's just a lie.\n\n2:10:38.540 --> 2:10:40.460\n Well, I'm not surprised.\n\n2:10:40.460 --> 2:10:42.300\n Tell me that you know.\n\n2:10:42.300 --> 2:10:43.620\n No, you don't.\n\n2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:45.540\n Yeah, you're just like me.\n\n2:10:45.540 --> 2:10:48.700\n Can we just all hope for the best?\n\n2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:51.420\n Take it easy.\n\n2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:52.260\n So that's it for me.\n\n2:10:52.260 --> 2:10:56.580\n It's like, I'm in a place where I'm like, I don't know.\n\n2:10:56.580 --> 2:10:58.940\n Tell me, I'm not gonna believe you.\n\n2:10:58.940 --> 2:10:59.780\n Maybe you do.\n\n2:10:59.780 --> 2:11:00.940\n I'm not gonna believe it,\n\n2:11:00.940 --> 2:11:04.300\n but let's just be easier on each other\n\n2:11:04.300 --> 2:11:07.420\n and try to find truth wherever it may lie.\n\n2:11:07.420 --> 2:11:11.220\n But above all, know that we don't know jack shit.\n\n2:11:11.220 --> 2:11:13.020\n I think that's a mic drop moment.\n\n2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:14.100\n Dan, thank you so much.\n\n2:11:14.100 --> 2:11:15.260\n You're an incredible human.\n\n2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:17.500\n I love that you share with the world\n\n2:11:17.500 --> 2:11:20.980\n the darkness of your mind, of your life experience\n\n2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:23.340\n and the beautiful light that you've shown to the world.\n\n2:11:23.340 --> 2:11:25.260\n So it's a huge honor\n\n2:11:25.260 --> 2:11:27.060\n and thank you for spending your valuable time.\n\n2:11:27.060 --> 2:11:28.140\n Good luck on the tour.\n\n2:11:28.140 --> 2:11:28.980\n Thanks, man.\n\n2:11:28.980 --> 2:11:30.460\n Thanks for having me.\n\n2:11:30.460 --> 2:11:31.940\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:11:31.940 --> 2:11:33.020\n with Dan Reynolds.\n\n2:11:33.020 --> 2:11:34.300\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:11:34.300 --> 2:11:36.940\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:38.980\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:11:38.980 --> 2:11:40.340\n from Aldous Huxley.\n\n2:11:41.220 --> 2:11:44.260\n After silence, that which comes nearest\n\n2:11:44.260 --> 2:11:48.500\n to expressing the inexpressible is music.\n\n2:11:48.500 --> 2:12:00.060\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
