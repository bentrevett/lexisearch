00:08.980\n former MMA fighter, and at least in my opinion,\n\n00:08.980 --> 00:12.300\n one of the great UFC corner man coaches to listen to.\n\n00:12.300 --> 00:15.200\n And also, he's my current jiu jitsu coach\n\n00:15.200 --> 00:17.600\n at Broadway Jiu Jitsu in South Boston.\n\n00:17.600 --> 00:22.160\n He was once, for a time, a philosophy major in college,\n\n00:22.160 --> 00:26.320\n and is now, I would say, a kind of practicing philosopher,\n\n00:26.320 --> 00:28.360\n opinionated, brilliant,\n\n00:28.360 --> 00:31.720\n and someone I always enjoy talking to even when,\n\n00:31.720 --> 00:36.040\n especially when, we disagree, which we do often.\n\n00:36.040 --> 00:38.040\n He's definitely someone I can see talking to\n\n00:38.040 --> 00:39.960\n many times on this podcast.\n\n00:39.960 --> 00:43.280\n In fact, he hosts a new podcast of his own\n\n00:43.280 --> 00:45.680\n called Please Allow Me.\n\n00:46.760 --> 00:48.440\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n00:48.440 --> 00:50.880\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:50.880 --> 00:52.920\n Thank you to Theragun,\n\n00:52.920 --> 00:56.080\n the device I use for post workout muscle recovery,\n\n00:56.080 --> 00:58.800\n Magic Spoon, low carb keto friendly cereal\n\n00:58.800 --> 01:00.720\n that I think is delicious,\n\n01:00.720 --> 01:03.320\n Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself\n\n01:03.320 --> 01:06.120\n and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep,\n\n01:06.120 --> 01:09.880\n and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n01:09.880 --> 01:12.480\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:12.480 --> 01:15.640\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:15.640 --> 01:18.240\n As a side note, let me say that martial arts,\n\n01:18.240 --> 01:20.120\n especially jiu jitsu and judo,\n\n01:20.120 --> 01:22.960\n have been a big part of my growth as a human being.\n\n01:22.960 --> 01:25.360\n So I think I will talk to a few martial artists\n\n01:25.360 --> 01:27.280\n on occasion on this podcast.\n\n01:27.280 --> 01:29.520\n I hope that is of interest to you.\n\n01:29.520 --> 01:31.920\n I won't talk to people who are simply great fighters\n\n01:31.920 --> 01:35.040\n or great athletes, but people who have a philosophy\n\n01:35.040 --> 01:37.640\n that I find to be interesting and worth exploring,\n\n01:37.640 --> 01:41.520\n even if I disagree with parts or most of it.\n\n01:41.520 --> 01:43.440\n I like alternating between historians\n\n01:43.440 --> 01:46.440\n and computer scientists, fighters and biologists,\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:50.000\n and between totally different worldviews and personalities,\n\n01:50.000 --> 01:53.360\n like Elon Musk and Michael Malice.\n\n01:53.360 --> 01:56.320\n This world, to me, is fascinating\n\n01:56.320 --> 01:58.800\n because of the diversity of weirdness\n\n01:58.800 --> 02:00.920\n that is human civilization.\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:03.400\n I love the weird and the brilliant,\n\n02:03.400 --> 02:06.600\n and hope you join me on the journey of exploring both.\n\n02:06.600 --> 02:09.360\n If you don't like an episode, skip it.\n\n02:09.360 --> 02:11.360\n For an OCD person like myself,\n\n02:11.360 --> 02:14.160\n sometimes not listening to a podcast episode\n\n02:14.160 --> 02:16.040\n is an act of courage.\n\n02:16.040 --> 02:19.640\n It's like not finishing a book even though you're 80% done.\n\n02:19.640 --> 02:21.200\n Try it sometimes.\n\n02:21.200 --> 02:23.360\n Listen to ones you like, and don't listen\n\n02:23.360 --> 02:25.000\n to the ones you don't like.\n\n02:25.000 --> 02:27.920\n I know, it's profound advice.\n\n02:27.920 --> 02:30.360\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:30.360 --> 02:32.480\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n02:32.480 --> 02:35.160\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,\n\n02:35.160 --> 02:38.840\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n02:38.840 --> 02:42.760\n And now, here's my conversation with John Clark.\n\n02:43.760 --> 02:45.240\n You ready for this?\n\n02:45.240 --> 02:46.720\n I've been ready for this my whole life.\n\n02:46.720 --> 02:50.040\n All right, I was thinking of doing a Kerouac style road trip\n\n02:50.040 --> 02:51.520\n across the United States,\n\n02:52.560 --> 02:54.920\n after this whole COVID thing lifts.\n\n02:54.920 --> 02:56.840\n You ever take a trip like that?\n\n02:56.840 --> 02:59.840\n I've done a handful of long distance driving trips\n\n03:01.320 --> 03:04.840\n up and down the East Coast, but also from the West Coast\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:08.600\n back to the East Coast, and then returning to California.\n\n03:08.600 --> 03:10.440\n So I've definitely done my fair share\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:12.600\n of driving in this country.\n\n03:12.600 --> 03:15.480\n Do you have the longing for the great American road trip?\n\n03:16.360 --> 03:18.400\n I think there are so many things\n\n03:18.400 --> 03:20.560\n that I've been lucky enough to see in the world\n\n03:20.560 --> 03:22.720\n that I now, at this point in my life, realize\n\n03:22.720 --> 03:25.440\n there are tons of things that I need to see here\n\n03:25.440 --> 03:27.680\n in this country, and a road trip could potentially\n\n03:27.680 --> 03:29.680\n be the best way to see them.\n\n03:30.760 --> 03:34.160\n I think to do it effectively, you need an amount of time\n\n03:34.160 --> 03:36.560\n where you can be as leisurely as possible.\n\n03:36.560 --> 03:38.480\n There's no deadline, and there's no,\n\n03:38.480 --> 03:41.480\n I've gotta make it from Chicago to St. Louis by sundown\n\n03:41.480 --> 03:43.520\n to get to this place at this time.\n\n03:43.520 --> 03:45.960\n I think you really need to be able to take your time\n\n03:45.960 --> 03:50.960\n and kind of let the road take you where you need to go.\n\n03:51.280 --> 03:54.160\n It feels like you need a mission though, ultimately.\n\n03:54.160 --> 03:56.080\n There's a reason you need to be in San Francisco.\n\n03:56.080 --> 03:57.720\n That's like the Kerouac thing.\n\n03:57.720 --> 04:00.120\n You have to meet somebody somewhere kind of loosely\n\n04:00.120 --> 04:03.280\n in a few weeks, and then it's the,\n\n04:03.280 --> 04:06.440\n as you struggle on towards that mission,\n\n04:06.440 --> 04:08.480\n you meet weird characters that get in your way,\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:11.480\n but ultimately sort of create an experience.\n\n04:11.480 --> 04:13.560\n I think having a loose deadline is good,\n\n04:13.560 --> 04:16.080\n but that's a beginning and an end point,\n\n04:16.080 --> 04:18.520\n and what I mean is I don't wanna have to be,\n\n04:18.520 --> 04:22.280\n all right, we're leaving, say, Boston on Sunday night.\n\n04:22.280 --> 04:25.200\n Let's get to New York by Monday morning,\n\n04:25.200 --> 04:27.680\n and then from New York, we're gonna go to Philly,\n\n04:27.680 --> 04:30.120\n and we've gotta be in Philly at four.\n\n04:30.120 --> 04:32.080\n A vague beginning and end is fine,\n\n04:32.080 --> 04:36.520\n but I think having very strict guidelines in between\n\n04:36.520 --> 04:39.800\n will rob you of certain experiences along the way.\n\n04:39.800 --> 04:43.880\n If you have a timeframe to get from Philly to Indianapolis\n\n04:43.880 --> 04:46.080\n and some awesome shit starts to happen in Philly,\n\n04:46.080 --> 04:47.440\n do you really wanna have to cut it short\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:50.280\n because you gotta be in Indianapolis by sunup?\n\n04:50.280 --> 04:52.680\n Why do you have to be anywhere by any time\n\n04:52.680 --> 04:54.280\n for any reason, really?\n\n04:54.280 --> 04:55.520\n Plans change.\n\n04:55.520 --> 04:56.960\n Plans change all the time, exactly,\n\n04:56.960 --> 05:00.160\n but if we're talking about having a mission\n\n05:00.160 --> 05:01.960\n or the type of road trip,\n\n05:01.960 --> 05:04.040\n I just think it would be best to have it\n\n05:04.040 --> 05:07.680\n as loose and flexible as possible.\n\n05:07.680 --> 05:08.520\n I don't know.\n\n05:08.520 --> 05:12.320\n You gotta make hard deadlines and then break them.\n\n05:12.320 --> 05:13.520\n Totally change the plans.\n\n05:13.520 --> 05:15.680\n Disappoint people, break promises.\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:17.080\n That's the way of life.\n\n05:17.080 --> 05:19.160\n Somebody's waiting for you in St. Louis,\n\n05:19.160 --> 05:21.560\n and all of a sudden, you fell in love\n\n05:21.560 --> 05:23.640\n with a biker in New York.\n\n05:23.640 --> 05:24.480\n I don't know.\n\n05:24.480 --> 05:25.400\n I don't know what you're up to.\n\n05:25.400 --> 05:29.680\n I can appreciate that, but on a trip like that,\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:33.120\n I feel like a trip with deadlines\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:34.920\n is for a different point in your life,\n\n05:34.920 --> 05:35.960\n and at this point in my life,\n\n05:35.960 --> 05:37.440\n I don't want any of the deadlines\n\n05:37.440 --> 05:39.760\n because it's not about meeting someone\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:41.640\n and disappointing them in St. Louis.\n\n05:41.640 --> 05:45.320\n It's about me not disappointing myself.\n\n05:45.320 --> 05:48.360\n You wanna have enough time in what you're doing\n\n05:48.360 --> 05:50.480\n to make sure that you get the full breadth\n\n05:50.480 --> 05:52.800\n of every experience that you encounter.\n\n05:52.800 --> 05:55.320\n How would you fully experience a place?\n\n05:55.320 --> 05:56.160\n How would you?\n\n05:56.160 --> 05:59.160\n I don't think I've actually fully experienced Boston.\n\n05:59.160 --> 06:02.080\n If you were showing up to a city for a week\n\n06:02.080 --> 06:04.440\n on this road trip, what would you do?\n\n06:04.440 --> 06:06.600\n So I'm gonna answer that in two parts.\n\n06:06.600 --> 06:09.080\n A few years ago, I had an opportunity to move out of Boston,\n\n06:09.080 --> 06:12.280\n and the thing that kept me here, no question about it,\n\n06:12.280 --> 06:16.040\n was the fact that I felt like I had a contract\n\n06:16.040 --> 06:18.560\n with my students, and I did not.\n\n06:18.560 --> 06:22.280\n I felt like a great many of them took a leap of faith\n\n06:22.280 --> 06:26.320\n by joining my gym and asking me to teach them what I know,\n\n06:26.320 --> 06:29.360\n and when I had an opportunity to leave Boston,\n\n06:29.360 --> 06:30.720\n I thought of those people,\n\n06:30.720 --> 06:33.560\n and I thought, I wanna fulfill my obligation to them.\n\n06:33.560 --> 06:35.840\n So because I made a decision to stay here,\n\n06:35.840 --> 06:37.560\n I then that summer made a decision\n\n06:37.560 --> 06:39.440\n to endear myself to the city of Boston,\n\n06:39.440 --> 06:40.920\n and I tried to find lots and lots\n\n06:40.920 --> 06:42.360\n of different things to do.\n\n06:42.360 --> 06:43.840\n I can tell you that the coolest thing\n\n06:43.840 --> 06:47.520\n that I found to do in this city is the MFA,\n\n06:48.400 --> 06:50.560\n where they have on Friday nights,\n\n06:50.560 --> 06:52.440\n they'll have different exhibits and stuff,\n\n06:52.440 --> 06:55.160\n and they'll have little beer carts and food tents,\n\n06:55.160 --> 06:59.040\n and you can go do a painting class off on the side.\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:01.640\n Very cool night of things to do.\n\n07:01.640 --> 07:04.600\n But in general, whenever I'm in a new city,\n\n07:04.600 --> 07:06.560\n I try not to pay attention to Google,\n\n07:06.560 --> 07:10.160\n and I try not to do anything that I find on a travel site.\n\n07:10.160 --> 07:13.160\n The best thing to do is to walk out of your hotel\n\n07:13.160 --> 07:14.480\n or wherever it is you're staying\n\n07:14.480 --> 07:17.240\n and find the most normal looking bar,\n\n07:17.240 --> 07:19.280\n have a drink, and talk to a bartender.\n\n07:19.280 --> 07:21.000\n So the people, the people.\n\n07:21.000 --> 07:23.440\n The people, and then you can experience that town\n\n07:23.440 --> 07:25.560\n the way that they experience it.\n\n07:25.560 --> 07:28.880\n Even in a city where there are tons of tourist attractions,\n\n07:28.880 --> 07:32.280\n locals probably visit the same tourist attractions\n\n07:32.280 --> 07:34.080\n when they have visitors come from out of town,\n\n07:34.080 --> 07:36.680\n you wanna see how they view those places\n\n07:36.680 --> 07:38.040\n and how they visit them.\n\n07:38.040 --> 07:40.640\n And you wanna go to eat where they're going to eat.\n\n07:40.640 --> 07:44.600\n Like, you're gonna, for the most part,\n\n07:44.600 --> 07:47.080\n the North End is not a place where I would take someone\n\n07:47.080 --> 07:49.320\n and say, hey, this is Boston's,\n\n07:49.320 --> 07:51.320\n the pinnacle of Boston dining,\n\n07:51.320 --> 07:52.400\n because it's very touristy.\n\n07:52.400 --> 07:54.280\n There are a handful of really good restaurants there,\n\n07:54.280 --> 07:56.520\n but I wanna know where the,\n\n07:56.520 --> 07:57.840\n I wanna go to Bogie's Place.\n\n07:57.840 --> 08:00.480\n I wanna know the down low spots where.\n\n08:00.480 --> 08:01.520\n The hell's Bogie's Place?\n\n08:01.520 --> 08:04.080\n It's like a little steakhouse in the back of J.M. Curly's.\n\n08:04.080 --> 08:04.920\n Exactly.\n\n08:04.920 --> 08:06.000\n It's like a shitty bar?\n\n08:06.000 --> 08:06.840\n J.M. Curly's?\n\n08:06.840 --> 08:09.080\n No, it's just a bar with like bar food.\n\n08:09.080 --> 08:10.280\n But I think that like.\n\n08:11.280 --> 08:12.360\n In South Boston?\n\n08:12.360 --> 08:13.200\n It is in Boston, yeah.\n\n08:13.200 --> 08:14.200\n It's not South Boston?\n\n08:14.200 --> 08:18.680\n No, it's in, it's in the downtown area.\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:21.360\n Like, I don't know what the neighborhoods\n\n08:21.360 --> 08:22.360\n are called here, honestly,\n\n08:22.360 --> 08:25.280\n because they have an area called Downtown Boston,\n\n08:25.280 --> 08:27.080\n and I don't even know what the hell that means.\n\n08:27.080 --> 08:28.280\n And they used to have the Financial District.\n\n08:28.280 --> 08:29.440\n Where's Southie?\n\n08:29.440 --> 08:31.080\n Cause I've heard about the Southie.\n\n08:31.080 --> 08:33.000\n Southie is South Boston.\n\n08:33.000 --> 08:36.400\n But is there a difference between South Boston and Southie?\n\n08:36.400 --> 08:37.760\n No, it's the same thing.\n\n08:37.760 --> 08:39.400\n No, but like, you know, the mythical Southie.\n\n08:39.400 --> 08:41.280\n I think the mythical Southie\n\n08:41.280 --> 08:44.040\n is something that's long gone now.\n\n08:44.040 --> 08:48.960\n And the term now actually is Sobo.\n\n08:48.960 --> 08:49.800\n Oh no.\n\n08:49.800 --> 08:50.640\n Yeah, it's.\n\n08:50.640 --> 08:52.800\n It's changed, what, who took over what?\n\n08:52.800 --> 08:55.240\n What's the, you know, the good will hunting personality.\n\n08:55.240 --> 08:56.280\n That's Southie, isn't it?\n\n08:56.280 --> 08:58.440\n Strong accent, those bad ass dudes.\n\n08:58.440 --> 09:00.840\n I came here right at the end of like,\n\n09:00.840 --> 09:02.280\n what was South Boston.\n\n09:02.280 --> 09:05.040\n So when I got, and my gym is in South Boston,\n\n09:05.040 --> 09:07.480\n the neighborhood was just starting to change.\n\n09:07.480 --> 09:10.520\n So I think,\n\n09:12.880 --> 09:14.440\n as gentrification happened\n\n09:14.440 --> 09:16.880\n and they started building more luxury condominiums,\n\n09:16.880 --> 09:18.600\n they were buying all these old businesses out,\n\n09:18.600 --> 09:19.840\n all the mom and pop businesses.\n\n09:19.840 --> 09:23.480\n And I think that kind of changed\n\n09:23.480 --> 09:25.840\n the makeup of the community.\n\n09:25.840 --> 09:27.920\n And it wasn't only because there was an influx\n\n09:27.920 --> 09:31.160\n of new young people with disposable income,\n\n09:31.160 --> 09:34.200\n it's because there's an exodus of the older people\n\n09:34.200 --> 09:35.800\n who kind of grew up and raised their families there\n\n09:35.800 --> 09:37.080\n because they were being offered\n\n09:37.080 --> 09:39.000\n humongous sums of money for their homes\n\n09:39.000 --> 09:41.480\n that they had bought like in the late 70s and early 80s\n\n09:41.480 --> 09:43.200\n so that they could develop those areas.\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:46.000\n So you have a combination of the influx of new people\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:47.480\n and the exodus of the old,\n\n09:47.480 --> 09:49.640\n and now you just got this totally new neighborhood\n\n09:49.640 --> 09:50.880\n in its place.\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:53.520\n What do you love about Boston?\n\n09:53.520 --> 09:58.520\n Is there a love still for Boston?\n\n09:58.520 --> 10:00.280\n You certainly have the love of the thing\n\n10:00.280 --> 10:01.760\n that's gone as well.\n\n10:01.760 --> 10:05.080\n Yeah, I think, I don't wanna pinpoint pin this on Boston\n\n10:05.080 --> 10:08.040\n because it's happening in all great cities.\n\n10:08.040 --> 10:10.160\n As these areas become gentrified,\n\n10:10.160 --> 10:11.680\n what's happening is the personality\n\n10:11.680 --> 10:12.960\n and the character of the neighborhood\n\n10:12.960 --> 10:14.960\n is just being run out.\n\n10:14.960 --> 10:16.920\n And I have nothing against people coming in\n\n10:16.920 --> 10:18.240\n and making money and things like that.\n\n10:18.240 --> 10:21.400\n But when you do it at the expense of the culture,\n\n10:21.400 --> 10:24.400\n the character and the personality of the neighborhood,\n\n10:24.400 --> 10:27.160\n I mean, you're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n10:27.160 --> 10:28.360\n These are the people that came here\n\n10:28.360 --> 10:30.200\n and built these areas up.\n\n10:30.200 --> 10:31.800\n It happens here in Boston,\n\n10:31.800 --> 10:34.560\n it happens in all over New York,\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:36.680\n happens on the West Coast.\n\n10:36.680 --> 10:41.160\n So what I love about Boston is not nearly as romantic\n\n10:41.160 --> 10:42.960\n as what it might've been 15 years ago\n\n10:42.960 --> 10:45.080\n and what I used to love about New York.\n\n10:45.080 --> 10:50.080\n What I love about Boston is that it's walkable.\n\n10:51.640 --> 10:54.440\n The food scene is on the rise here.\n\n10:55.880 --> 10:59.600\n But I think you're hard pressed to find the charm\n\n10:59.600 --> 11:03.440\n that people think of when they think of old Boston\n\n11:03.440 --> 11:04.600\n and old New England city.\n\n11:04.600 --> 11:05.880\n So yeah, I see it differently.\n\n11:05.880 --> 11:08.560\n People sometimes criticize like MIT\n\n11:08.560 --> 11:11.440\n like for the thing that it is now.\n\n11:11.440 --> 11:13.600\n But I think it is always like that.\n\n11:13.600 --> 11:18.600\n I tend to prefer to carry the flame of the greatness,\n\n11:20.320 --> 11:22.440\n the greatest moments of its history\n\n11:22.440 --> 11:26.160\n and like sort of enjoy the echoes of that\n\n11:26.160 --> 11:27.320\n in the halls of MIT.\n\n11:27.320 --> 11:29.800\n In the same way in Boston, you think about the history\n\n11:29.800 --> 11:33.080\n and that history lives on in the few individuals.\n\n11:33.080 --> 11:36.960\n Like you can't just look around what Boston is now\n\n11:36.960 --> 11:38.840\n and be like, what has Boston become?\n\n11:38.840 --> 11:43.400\n I think it was always carried by a minority of individuals.\n\n11:43.400 --> 11:46.000\n I think we kind of look back in history\n\n11:46.000 --> 11:48.400\n and think like times were greater\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:50.360\n in a certain kind of dimension back then.\n\n11:50.360 --> 11:52.800\n But that's because we remember,\n\n11:53.880 --> 11:57.400\n this is a ridiculous non data driven assertion of mine,\n\n11:57.400 --> 12:02.400\n is to remember just the brightest stars of that history.\n\n12:02.640 --> 12:04.160\n And so we romanticize it.\n\n12:04.160 --> 12:05.800\n But I think if you look around now,\n\n12:05.800 --> 12:07.960\n those special people are still living in Boston\n\n12:07.960 --> 12:10.480\n for which Boston will be remembered as a great city\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:11.920\n in like 50 years.\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:14.040\n I think you're probably right, but isn't there some sort\n\n12:14.040 --> 12:19.040\n of theory about the point that there's like a certain age\n\n12:20.040 --> 12:22.400\n in your life where things resonate differently to you?\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:23.600\n Like, I think they've done studies\n\n12:23.600 --> 12:26.560\n where most people stop searching for new music\n\n12:26.560 --> 12:28.080\n after age 19.\n\n12:28.080 --> 12:30.600\n Most dads you see like wearing super old clothes,\n\n12:30.600 --> 12:33.840\n like that's the style of the time period\n\n12:33.840 --> 12:35.960\n of the last great part of their life.\n\n12:35.960 --> 12:38.760\n So like there's an evolution in people\n\n12:38.760 --> 12:41.560\n and it could also be the memories of where they live.\n\n12:41.560 --> 12:44.160\n And when I was 17, of course my neighborhood\n\n12:44.160 --> 12:46.520\n was the best then because I was having the most fun.\n\n12:46.520 --> 12:49.640\n And we always kind of look at things through that tint,\n\n12:49.640 --> 12:51.720\n I think, and you're right.\n\n12:51.720 --> 12:53.120\n And I don't think there's anything wrong\n\n12:53.120 --> 12:55.600\n with the way cities are evolving now.\n\n12:55.600 --> 13:00.600\n It's just not, I prefer the time of like a mom and pop store,\n\n13:01.400 --> 13:06.400\n not a fabricated like gastropub that could just be like\n\n13:06.600 --> 13:08.320\n on a four lane super highway\n\n13:08.320 --> 13:10.520\n on your way out of Epcot Center.\n\n13:10.520 --> 13:13.480\n And it's actually owned by like some conglomerate.\n\n13:13.480 --> 13:15.200\n But there's still the special places.\n\n13:15.200 --> 13:17.760\n Like I, this takes us back to the road trip\n\n13:17.760 --> 13:22.560\n is maybe I tend to romanticize the experiences\n\n13:22.560 --> 13:25.520\n of like the diners in the middle of nowhere.\n\n13:25.520 --> 13:27.880\n What would you say makes for like,\n\n13:29.520 --> 13:33.240\n it feels like life is made up of these experiences\n\n13:33.240 --> 13:36.400\n that maybe on paper seem mundane,\n\n13:36.400 --> 13:39.720\n but are actually somehow give you a chance\n\n13:39.720 --> 13:42.000\n to pause and reflect on life\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:45.080\n with like a certain kind of people,\n\n13:45.080 --> 13:47.920\n whether like really close friends or complete strangers,\n\n13:47.920 --> 13:50.040\n maybe alcohol is involved in the middle of nowhere.\n\n13:50.040 --> 13:52.800\n It seems like a road trip facilitates that\n\n13:52.800 --> 13:54.120\n if you allow it to.\n\n13:54.120 --> 13:56.000\n Like what do you think makes for those kinds of experience?\n\n13:56.000 --> 13:56.920\n Have you had any?\n\n13:57.760 --> 14:00.640\n I think in the context of a road trip,\n\n14:00.640 --> 14:02.880\n I think it's like hyper localization.\n\n14:02.880 --> 14:10.640\n And I think it is those experiences along the way\n\n14:10.640 --> 14:14.200\n with people and the people that you're with\n\n14:14.200 --> 14:15.600\n will color the experiences differently\n\n14:15.600 --> 14:17.840\n depending on the person.\n\n14:17.840 --> 14:20.000\n The road trip you took was with somebody else or alone?\n\n14:20.000 --> 14:23.240\n So I've driven up and down the East Coast several times.\n\n14:23.240 --> 14:26.680\n When I drove from LA to New York,\n\n14:26.680 --> 14:29.960\n my friend was on the run from the cops.\n\n14:29.960 --> 14:30.800\n Yeah.\n\n14:30.800 --> 14:32.200\n So we were trying to get out of.\n\n14:32.200 --> 14:33.240\n Traffic tickets?\n\n14:33.240 --> 14:34.520\n Yeah, traffic tickets.\n\n14:34.520 --> 14:35.520\n Yeah, allegedly.\n\n14:35.520 --> 14:36.960\n We were trying to get out of LA\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:40.520\n because he was going to have to go away for a little while.\n\n14:40.520 --> 14:43.200\n So we drove from LA and we just,\n\n14:43.200 --> 14:45.120\n we were young kids, we had no idea what we were doing,\n\n14:45.120 --> 14:46.840\n and we drove East.\n\n14:46.840 --> 14:49.680\n And then we had an unbelievable trip,\n\n14:49.680 --> 14:52.000\n mostly because we didn't really have a destination,\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.760\n we didn't really have a timeframe, thank goodness,\n\n14:54.760 --> 14:57.120\n because he got arrested again in Pennsylvania.\n\n14:57.120 --> 14:59.080\n So we got kind of stuck there.\n\n14:59.080 --> 15:02.040\n And then we drove back to LA\n\n15:02.040 --> 15:04.040\n when he got out in Pennsylvania.\n\n15:05.920 --> 15:08.000\n But all the stops along the way\n\n15:08.960 --> 15:10.800\n were kind of like weird things,\n\n15:10.800 --> 15:11.880\n like you have no money, right?\n\n15:11.880 --> 15:14.160\n So you're finding that like a little diamond\n\n15:14.160 --> 15:15.800\n in the rough place to eat,\n\n15:15.800 --> 15:18.160\n the diner you talk about, like that place.\n\n15:18.160 --> 15:20.840\n I once was in, where was I?\n\n15:20.840 --> 15:22.080\n I think I was in Buenos Aires.\n\n15:22.080 --> 15:23.880\n And the guy that I was with, he said,\n\n15:23.880 --> 15:26.920\n I know this quaint little spot around the corner.\n\n15:26.920 --> 15:28.440\n And I was young, I was like 25.\n\n15:28.440 --> 15:32.040\n And I thought the coolest thing in the world would be\n\n15:32.040 --> 15:33.960\n to be such a citizen of the world\n\n15:33.960 --> 15:36.800\n that you know these quaint little spots around the corner\n\n15:36.800 --> 15:38.240\n in like all these great cities.\n\n15:38.240 --> 15:40.720\n Like I know where to get this great chicken sandwich\n\n15:40.720 --> 15:41.560\n in Argentina.\n\n15:41.560 --> 15:44.080\n I know where to get this great meal in Costa Rica.\n\n15:44.080 --> 15:48.400\n I know where to get this super local egg in another country.\n\n15:48.400 --> 15:50.000\n And I just thought that that was really cool,\n\n15:50.000 --> 15:52.920\n the ability to do that anywhere in the world.\n\n15:52.920 --> 15:55.880\n Did you get closer with that guy through the trip?\n\n15:55.880 --> 15:58.880\n I found that like, so I took a trip across the United States\n\n15:58.880 --> 16:01.200\n with a guy friend of mine.\n\n16:01.200 --> 16:02.280\n We had different goals.\n\n16:02.280 --> 16:04.000\n I was searching for meaning in life\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:05.520\n and he was searching for,\n\n16:06.800 --> 16:09.680\n what's the politically correct way of phrasing it,\n\n16:09.680 --> 16:12.480\n but just basically trying to sleep\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:15.360\n with every kind of woman that this world has to offer.\n\n16:15.360 --> 16:17.080\n What's the difference between those two things?\n\n16:17.080 --> 16:18.360\n Well, I guess he was searching\n\n16:18.360 --> 16:20.080\n for the different kinds of meanings.\n\n16:20.080 --> 16:25.080\n Yeah, I mean, I still think that you can't find meaning\n\n16:26.280 --> 16:28.520\n between a woman's legs, I suppose.\n\n16:28.520 --> 16:30.000\n Have you tried all of them?\n\n16:31.720 --> 16:34.160\n But there was a tension there.\n\n16:34.160 --> 16:36.400\n We grew closer with those experiences,\n\n16:36.400 --> 16:38.000\n but we've gotten in fights.\n\n16:39.280 --> 16:42.080\n There was a lot of like literal almost fights\n\n16:42.080 --> 16:44.760\n and then we were close and there was like silences,\n\n16:44.760 --> 16:46.240\n but then we were like brothers\n\n16:46.240 --> 16:49.920\n and this whole weird journey of friendship that we went on.\n\n16:49.920 --> 16:52.840\n I think anytime you spend that much time\n\n16:52.840 --> 16:55.720\n in like a small space with another person,\n\n16:55.720 --> 16:57.600\n you're gonna have the different parts\n\n16:57.600 --> 16:59.200\n of the relationship will manifest themselves.\n\n16:59.200 --> 17:00.840\n You'll have the periods of closeness.\n\n17:00.840 --> 17:02.320\n You'll have the periods of vulnerability\n\n17:02.320 --> 17:04.720\n where it's like maybe you're driving through Denver\n\n17:04.720 --> 17:05.680\n and it's three in the morning\n\n17:05.680 --> 17:06.720\n and you talk about something\n\n17:06.720 --> 17:08.600\n you might not have otherwise talked about.\n\n17:08.600 --> 17:09.440\n You'll have the periods\n\n17:09.440 --> 17:12.240\n where you don't wanna see that motherfucker ever again.\n\n17:12.240 --> 17:15.520\n He didn't, and depending could be because of anything.\n\n17:16.520 --> 17:19.520\n But the guy that I drove twice with,\n\n17:19.520 --> 17:22.640\n we're still in contact, we're still buddies.\n\n17:24.480 --> 17:27.000\n We have very different goals also,\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.120\n but at that point in our lives,\n\n17:28.120 --> 17:31.760\n we never even contemplated the meaning of life.\n\n17:31.760 --> 17:34.600\n We were about probably more to the point\n\n17:34.600 --> 17:35.920\n of the friend that you drove with.\n\n17:35.920 --> 17:38.080\n We were more about racking up experiences,\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:39.040\n whatever they were.\n\n17:40.120 --> 17:41.840\n I wanna be able to retell this.\n\n17:42.720 --> 17:43.560\n Stories.\n\n17:43.560 --> 17:45.080\n Yeah, I wanna be able to retell this\n\n17:45.080 --> 17:47.200\n and it's gotta sound cool.\n\n17:47.200 --> 17:49.040\n Like I don't wanna retell a story about,\n\n17:49.040 --> 17:50.400\n yeah and then we drove through Alabama\n\n17:50.400 --> 17:51.760\n and they've got a lovely library\n\n17:51.760 --> 17:52.960\n and I checked out this book\n\n17:52.960 --> 17:54.640\n and I'm not interested in retelling that.\n\n17:54.640 --> 17:58.200\n Do you remember any, this is a kid's show,\n\n17:58.200 --> 18:01.160\n do you remember any stories that the kids would enjoy\n\n18:01.160 --> 18:04.200\n from those times that were profound in some kind of way?\n\n18:05.400 --> 18:07.400\n There were some impactful moments\n\n18:08.360 --> 18:11.200\n on the beginning of our road trip where we had no money\n\n18:11.200 --> 18:13.320\n and as a couple of kids who knew nothing,\n\n18:13.320 --> 18:15.560\n we literally had to, we stopped in Vegas\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:17.440\n and we went to Circus Circus.\n\n18:17.440 --> 18:19.280\n At the time they had $3 blackjack\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:20.720\n and we had like 12 bucks\n\n18:20.720 --> 18:22.560\n and my buddy was a kind of a degenerate gambler\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:23.440\n so he knew what was up.\n\n18:23.440 --> 18:25.480\n I was just like kind of stuffing chips in my pockets,\n\n18:25.480 --> 18:28.200\n making sure we could pay for the gas.\n\n18:28.200 --> 18:31.280\n And just being at a point which is like a starting line\n\n18:31.280 --> 18:34.240\n and like we drove from LA to Vegas,\n\n18:34.240 --> 18:36.040\n which is only about four hours\n\n18:36.040 --> 18:38.280\n and being at the starting line and realizing like,\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:41.200\n we may not even like get off the starting line here.\n\n18:41.200 --> 18:42.800\n And if we don't, what are we doing?\n\n18:42.800 --> 18:44.320\n We're gonna be two guys stuck in Vegas.\n\n18:44.320 --> 18:45.160\n We have no money.\n\n18:45.160 --> 18:47.040\n We can't go West because you're gonna get pinched.\n\n18:47.040 --> 18:48.240\n We have no money to go East.\n\n18:48.240 --> 18:49.080\n What the hell are we gonna do?\n\n18:49.080 --> 18:50.540\n Are we gonna wind up in Vegas?\n\n18:51.640 --> 18:53.840\n So, you know, that was kind of a profound thing\n\n18:53.840 --> 18:56.440\n where you just, it's a turning,\n\n18:56.440 --> 18:59.300\n it potentially could have been a turning point in our lives\n\n18:59.300 --> 19:02.580\n had we not made enough money to continue going East.\n\n19:03.880 --> 19:05.680\n That's the beautiful thing about road trips\n\n19:05.680 --> 19:08.040\n when you're broke is like,\n\n19:08.040 --> 19:10.920\n in retrospect, everything turned out fine,\n\n19:10.920 --> 19:13.840\n but you're facing the complete darkness,\n\n19:13.840 --> 19:16.720\n the uncertainty of the possibilities laid before you.\n\n19:16.720 --> 19:20.200\n And like, I don't know if you were confident at that time,\n\n19:20.200 --> 19:23.940\n but like, I was really full of self doubt.\n\n19:23.940 --> 19:27.280\n Like just, all I could see is all the trajectories\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:28.560\n where you just screw up your life.\n\n19:28.560 --> 19:29.820\n Like, what am I doing with my life?\n\n19:29.820 --> 19:32.300\n I'm a failure, like all these dreams I've had,\n\n19:32.300 --> 19:34.640\n I've never realized I'm a complete piece of shit.\n\n19:34.640 --> 19:35.480\n All those kinds of things.\n\n19:35.480 --> 19:38.000\n I had no concept of consequence.\n\n19:38.000 --> 19:42.080\n I probably had toxoplasmosis.\n\n19:42.080 --> 19:45.060\n I had literally no concept of consequence.\n\n19:45.060 --> 19:47.320\n Immediate gratification was all I cared about.\n\n19:47.320 --> 19:48.860\n Oh, so existentialist.\n\n19:48.860 --> 19:53.860\n Yeah, it did not even enter my mind in my like early 20s\n\n19:55.180 --> 19:57.440\n that anything that I was doing at that point\n\n19:57.440 --> 19:59.680\n could reverberate for the rest of my life.\n\n19:59.680 --> 20:02.360\n I think part of me didn't even think I'd make it this far.\n\n20:02.360 --> 20:05.560\n And so I was not interested in like the long play.\n\n20:05.560 --> 20:06.400\n I remember thinking like,\n\n20:06.400 --> 20:08.900\n why should I be acting now in a way\n\n20:08.900 --> 20:12.040\n that might impact a point in my life I never reach?\n\n20:12.040 --> 20:17.040\n And yet now you are a man who searches for meaning in life,\n\n20:17.240 --> 20:20.760\n at least I would say to put another way,\n\n20:20.760 --> 20:25.260\n you think deeply about this world\n\n20:25.260 --> 20:27.480\n and in a philosophical context\n\n20:27.480 --> 20:30.480\n while also appreciating the violence\n\n20:30.480 --> 20:35.400\n of hurting other friends of yours, right?\n\n20:35.400 --> 20:36.400\n On a regular basis.\n\n20:36.400 --> 20:38.960\n So why do you think, I mean,\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:40.680\n maybe there's a broader question there,\n\n20:40.680 --> 20:42.500\n but it calls a personal question.\n\n20:42.500 --> 20:47.500\n It seems that people who fight for prolonged periods of time,\n\n20:49.040 --> 20:52.080\n like Jiu Jitsu people and mixed martial arts people,\n\n20:52.080 --> 20:57.080\n even military folks become over time philosophers.\n\n20:57.400 --> 20:58.280\n What is that?\n\n20:58.280 --> 21:02.160\n Is that, is there a parallel between fighting and violence\n\n21:02.160 --> 21:05.160\n and the philosophical depth with which you now have arrived\n\n21:05.160 --> 21:07.740\n from the starting point of being the full existentialist\n\n21:07.740 --> 21:09.800\n of like just living in the moment\n\n21:09.800 --> 21:14.800\n to like being introspective human now?\n\n21:14.800 --> 21:18.360\n I would say to that being a soldier\n\n21:18.360 --> 21:22.660\n or a warrior hundreds of years ago\n\n21:22.660 --> 21:24.820\n is probably what started the marriage\n\n21:24.820 --> 21:28.160\n between martial arts and philosophy.\n\n21:28.160 --> 21:31.060\n If you're constantly under someone else's charge\n\n21:31.060 --> 21:33.080\n and you're told to go out and walk in a line\n\n21:33.080 --> 21:36.840\n and overtake some Germanic tribe somewhere\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:41.840\n and that happens all the time, your job is being a soldier.\n\n21:43.760 --> 21:46.560\n On any given day, you might not come home.\n\n21:46.560 --> 21:48.240\n So I think that you have to start your day\n\n21:48.240 --> 21:52.240\n by thinking deeply about how you've lived to that point\n\n21:52.240 --> 21:54.500\n and the people that are living in and around you\n\n21:54.500 --> 21:55.800\n and how you've treated them.\n\n21:55.800 --> 21:58.140\n And I think that probably is what started the marriage\n\n21:58.140 --> 22:02.200\n of being kind of like a philosophical martial artist.\n\n22:02.200 --> 22:06.080\n You've got to really like on a daily basis,\n\n22:06.080 --> 22:09.960\n take stock of what's going on around you and inside you\n\n22:09.960 --> 22:13.880\n because we all suffer with this kind of idea.\n\n22:13.880 --> 22:16.440\n If today's my last day, did I do it right?\n\n22:16.440 --> 22:18.160\n And we don't really do it so much nowadays\n\n22:18.160 --> 22:19.860\n because we're so comfortable,\n\n22:19.860 --> 22:22.300\n but if we were being marched out to war every day,\n\n22:22.300 --> 22:25.000\n I think you'd see people live a little bit differently.\n\n22:26.280 --> 22:28.000\n And you treat the people around you\n\n22:28.000 --> 22:29.040\n a little bit differently.\n\n22:29.040 --> 22:30.720\n Do you think there's echoes of that\n\n22:30.720 --> 22:35.320\n in just even the sport of like grappling and Jiu Jitsu\n\n22:35.320 --> 22:37.200\n where you're facing your own mortality?\n\n22:37.200 --> 22:39.640\n We don't really think of it that way, but.\n\n22:39.640 --> 22:41.560\n To be honest, I think that a lot of people\n\n22:41.560 --> 22:45.520\n that train in a martial art in contemporary society,\n\n22:45.520 --> 22:48.080\n I don't consider them all martial artists.\n\n22:48.080 --> 22:50.000\n I think just because you train in martial art\n\n22:50.000 --> 22:51.480\n does not mean you're a martial artist.\n\n22:51.480 --> 22:53.880\n There are so many people that use martial arts\n\n22:53.880 --> 22:57.200\n as a form of exercise and like this little piece\n\n22:57.200 --> 23:00.120\n of self concept.\n\n23:00.120 --> 23:04.800\n They use martial arts as a tagline in their Instagram bio.\n\n23:04.800 --> 23:06.640\n And it's really a form of exercise.\n\n23:06.640 --> 23:09.320\n It's something they do, it's not something they are.\n\n23:09.320 --> 23:11.720\n And I think there's a big difference there.\n\n23:11.720 --> 23:13.520\n There's a bunch of stuff mixed up in there\n\n23:13.520 --> 23:16.840\n because the Instagram thing is something you do for,\n\n23:17.880 --> 23:20.800\n it's also, it could be something you are for display\n\n23:20.800 --> 23:24.000\n versus who you are in the private moments\n\n23:24.000 --> 23:26.560\n of searching and thinking and struggling\n\n23:26.560 --> 23:27.400\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n23:27.400 --> 23:29.680\n Instagram is a surface layer\n\n23:29.680 --> 23:34.000\n that much of modern society operates in,\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:37.320\n which is really problematic because there's that gap\n\n23:37.320 --> 23:40.520\n between the person you show to the world\n\n23:40.520 --> 23:42.440\n and the person you are in private life.\n\n23:42.440 --> 23:45.680\n And if you make majority of your project\n\n23:45.680 --> 23:48.080\n of the human project of your sort of few years\n\n23:48.080 --> 23:50.560\n on this earth, the optimization\n\n23:50.560 --> 23:53.200\n of the public Instagram profile,\n\n23:53.200 --> 23:56.000\n then you never develop this private person.\n\n23:56.000 --> 23:58.280\n But it does seem that if you do jiu jitsu long enough,\n\n23:58.280 --> 24:00.720\n it's very difficult not to fall into like,\n\n24:00.720 --> 24:04.960\n this has become a personal journey,\n\n24:04.960 --> 24:06.440\n an intellectual journey.\n\n24:06.440 --> 24:09.400\n Because like, if you get your ass kicked thousands of times,\n\n24:09.400 --> 24:12.200\n there's a certain point to where that,\n\n24:12.200 --> 24:14.440\n maybe it's like a defense mechanism,\n\n24:14.440 --> 24:15.920\n but that turns into some kind\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:18.520\n of deeply profound introspective experience\n\n24:18.520 --> 24:20.720\n versus like exercise.\n\n24:20.720 --> 24:21.920\n It's not yoga.\n\n24:21.920 --> 24:24.960\n Yeah, so let me go back first\n\n24:24.960 --> 24:26.360\n and address the Instagram point,\n\n24:26.360 --> 24:28.080\n which I think there's a difference\n\n24:28.080 --> 24:32.440\n between people whose Instagram is intrinsically tied\n\n24:32.440 --> 24:34.080\n to their profession and they have\n\n24:34.080 --> 24:35.880\n to put a specific profile out there.\n\n24:35.880 --> 24:37.480\n And I think in general,\n\n24:38.640 --> 24:42.560\n people who truthfully their business is tied\n\n24:42.560 --> 24:45.400\n to their Instagram profile, I wanna exclude them.\n\n24:45.400 --> 24:47.400\n I think that most people,\n\n24:47.400 --> 24:50.160\n Instagram is how they want to be seen.\n\n24:50.160 --> 24:53.360\n And that's not always congruent with who you are,\n\n24:53.360 --> 24:58.360\n but I think there is a level of dishonesty there.\n\n24:58.640 --> 25:00.440\n Like this is how I want people to see me.\n\n25:00.440 --> 25:02.280\n I'm gonna put all this stuff in my Instagram bio,\n\n25:02.280 --> 25:05.000\n but that's really not me.\n\n25:05.000 --> 25:06.680\n And when you do that,\n\n25:08.080 --> 25:11.640\n I think it's a little disingenuous and you're right.\n\n25:11.640 --> 25:13.760\n There's not, you're never really gonna marry\n\n25:13.760 --> 25:15.840\n those two things together and it gets tough.\n\n25:15.840 --> 25:17.320\n Let me, sorry to interrupt,\n\n25:17.320 --> 25:18.720\n let me push back on something.\n\n25:18.720 --> 25:23.080\n This is a good time to address the many flaws\n\n25:23.080 --> 25:25.600\n of the great and powerful John Clark.\n\n25:25.600 --> 25:29.360\n Okay, let's go there.\n\n25:29.360 --> 25:30.520\n Cause it's interesting.\n\n25:31.440 --> 25:35.840\n You strive so hard for excellence in your life\n\n25:35.840 --> 25:40.720\n and for extreme competence that you are visibly\n\n25:40.720 --> 25:43.120\n and physically off put by people\n\n25:43.120 --> 25:45.320\n who have not achieved competence.\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:51.960\n Do you think we should be nicer to the people who are,\n\n25:51.960 --> 25:56.520\n like you mentioned, a person who first picks up an art,\n\n25:56.520 --> 26:00.360\n picks up, becomes vegan, starts doing CrossFit,\n\n26:00.360 --> 26:02.400\n start doing Jiu Jitsu for the first time\n\n26:02.400 --> 26:04.280\n and create that as their,\n\n26:04.280 --> 26:07.120\n they're struggling through this like, who am I?\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:11.040\n And they're really overly proud and it's kind of ridiculous.\n\n26:11.040 --> 26:15.760\n And you and your wise chair have seen many battles.\n\n26:15.760 --> 26:19.820\n Yeah, that you see the ridiculousness of that.\n\n26:19.820 --> 26:24.820\n I tend to, I'm learning to give those folks,\n\n26:25.320 --> 26:28.520\n not to mock them and to sort of give them a chance\n\n26:28.520 --> 26:32.400\n to do their ridiculousness because I think I was that too.\n\n26:32.400 --> 26:34.200\n Let me first clarify.\n\n26:34.200 --> 26:36.320\n I wanna be clear about what you mean\n\n26:36.320 --> 26:38.320\n when you say a level of competence.\n\n26:38.320 --> 26:41.240\n Now I've never won a world championship.\n\n26:41.240 --> 26:45.280\n I've never, you know, there are plenty of things in my life\n\n26:45.280 --> 26:50.200\n where I've not achieved what most people would consider\n\n26:50.200 --> 26:54.080\n to be the penultimate level of success.\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:54.920\n Now.\n\n26:54.920 --> 26:56.160\n That's accomplishments.\n\n26:56.160 --> 26:58.480\n It's accomplishments, it's ribbons, it's things like that.\n\n26:58.480 --> 27:00.560\n And it's not that those things don't mean anything to me.\n\n27:00.560 --> 27:03.240\n And the fact that I haven't in some arenas\n\n27:03.240 --> 27:06.640\n is something that I wanna change,\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:09.320\n which is, we can talk about that in a second.\n\n27:09.320 --> 27:11.680\n But I think that there's a difference\n\n27:11.680 --> 27:16.320\n between the very eager noob of whatever it is they're doing\n\n27:17.160 --> 27:22.160\n who does the thing so that they can signal\n\n27:22.340 --> 27:24.040\n they do the thing.\n\n27:24.040 --> 27:26.800\n That's a person I have less respect for.\n\n27:26.800 --> 27:29.860\n So we know each other primarily through jujitsu.\n\n27:29.860 --> 27:31.320\n Look at a jujitsu tournament.\n\n27:32.740 --> 27:37.280\n There's this idea that people espouse online.\n\n27:37.280 --> 27:40.680\n I respect anyone with the guts to get on the mat\n\n27:40.680 --> 27:43.240\n and put it on the line and sign up for a tournament.\n\n27:43.240 --> 27:47.480\n That is the biggest load of shit I have ever heard.\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:48.320\n This is great.\n\n27:48.320 --> 27:50.840\n Do you know how easy it is for you\n\n27:50.840 --> 27:52.280\n to put your name on something\n\n27:52.280 --> 27:54.320\n and pay the registration fee and walk in there?\n\n27:54.320 --> 27:55.520\n That's not the hard part.\n\n27:55.520 --> 27:57.400\n That's the easiest part.\n\n27:57.400 --> 27:58.920\n I don't care if you lose your first match,\n\n27:58.920 --> 28:02.400\n but I respect the person who signs up for the tournament,\n\n28:02.400 --> 28:05.040\n registers for the tournament, goes on a diet,\n\n28:05.040 --> 28:07.740\n loses weight the right way, trains their ass off,\n\n28:07.740 --> 28:10.720\n and does the things properly and then goes on the mat.\n\n28:10.720 --> 28:12.960\n The person who simply signs their name\n\n28:12.960 --> 28:16.100\n on the registration form and jumps on the mat,\n\n28:16.100 --> 28:17.600\n if they haven't done these other things,\n\n28:17.600 --> 28:19.680\n they actually have nothing to lose.\n\n28:19.680 --> 28:21.920\n Because what they've done is they've stepped onto the mat,\n\n28:21.920 --> 28:25.760\n in the ring, in the cage with a bucket full of excuses.\n\n28:25.760 --> 28:29.680\n Sure you signed up, but you're not really vulnerable\n\n28:29.680 --> 28:31.800\n because you didn't run, you didn't do this,\n\n28:31.800 --> 28:33.640\n you didn't do all the things you're supposed to do.\n\n28:33.640 --> 28:38.360\n The person who eliminates every possible excuse\n\n28:38.360 --> 28:40.120\n and then steps on the mat\n\n28:40.120 --> 28:42.240\n and gets their ass kicked in the first round,\n\n28:42.240 --> 28:44.840\n I have so much more respect for that person\n\n28:44.840 --> 28:46.160\n than the person who does nothing\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:48.800\n and maybe on natural ability wins a couple of matches\n\n28:48.800 --> 28:50.960\n and then writes on Facebook\n\n28:50.960 --> 28:54.040\n on how I lost to the eventual champion.\n\n28:54.040 --> 28:56.320\n That's worth zero, that's worth zero.\n\n28:56.320 --> 28:58.880\n And in that process, what did you learn about yourself?\n\n28:58.880 --> 29:00.480\n You learned about yourself\n\n29:00.480 --> 29:02.800\n that you've got a natural level of aptitude\n\n29:02.800 --> 29:05.080\n for whatever this activity is that you're doing,\n\n29:05.080 --> 29:07.760\n but you didn't actually learn how to maximize it\n\n29:07.760 --> 29:10.160\n through training and through dedication\n\n29:10.160 --> 29:12.440\n and through all these other things.\n\n29:12.440 --> 29:17.440\n I'm an incredibly interested, novice musician.\n\n29:17.440 --> 29:20.400\n I like to play bass, but I don't put that on anything.\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:22.280\n And I stink at it.\n\n29:22.280 --> 29:24.120\n I would really love to be sick at it.\n\n29:24.120 --> 29:28.680\n I'm currently not, but I'm not running around,\n\n29:28.680 --> 29:31.360\n talking about entering, any of those other things.\n\n29:31.360 --> 29:33.400\n I do it, it's for myself\n\n29:33.400 --> 29:37.240\n and I wanna reach a level of competence in that.\n\n29:37.240 --> 29:40.680\n So the person that you have respect for\n\n29:40.680 --> 29:44.400\n is a person who takes it fully seriously,\n\n29:44.400 --> 29:47.400\n takes the effort fully seriously.\n\n29:47.400 --> 29:50.560\n So for bass, that would be that you agree with yourself\n\n29:50.560 --> 29:51.960\n that you're going to perform live\n\n29:51.960 --> 29:55.360\n and just in your own private moments, your private thoughts,\n\n29:55.360 --> 29:57.880\n you're not going to give yourself an excuse out,\n\n29:57.880 --> 29:59.120\n like, I'm just gonna have fun.\n\n29:59.120 --> 30:00.400\n This is a nice experience.\n\n30:00.400 --> 30:02.960\n You're going to think I'm going to try\n\n30:02.960 --> 30:05.040\n to be the best possible bass player\n\n30:05.040 --> 30:07.760\n given everything that's going on in my life,\n\n30:07.760 --> 30:10.280\n but I'm going to do my, like actually,\n\n30:10.280 --> 30:11.920\n and put it all on the line.\n\n30:11.920 --> 30:16.640\n And if I fail, that's not because I didn't try,\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:18.320\n it's because I'm a failure.\n\n30:18.320 --> 30:19.160\n Exactly.\n\n30:19.160 --> 30:24.160\n And then sit in that sick feeling of like, I'm a failure.\n\n30:24.880 --> 30:26.440\n But isn't that an important thing to know?\n\n30:26.440 --> 30:27.520\n Absolutely.\n\n30:27.520 --> 30:32.520\n But there's a, that's like the best thing it could be,\n\n30:34.280 --> 30:36.560\n but sometimes it's fun to lose yourself\n\n30:36.560 --> 30:41.560\n in the bragging, in the lesser ways of life.\n\n30:42.320 --> 30:45.600\n And I think I'm careful not to,\n\n30:46.840 --> 30:48.840\n because too many people in my life,\n\n30:49.720 --> 30:51.880\n when I brought them with like a little candle\n\n30:51.880 --> 30:56.200\n of a fire of a dream, they would just go like,\n\n30:56.200 --> 30:58.880\n they would just blow that fire out,\n\n30:58.880 --> 31:00.640\n that they would dismiss me.\n\n31:00.640 --> 31:03.960\n Cause they see like, I would say,\n\n31:03.960 --> 31:05.800\n I've said a lot of ridiculous stuff,\n\n31:05.800 --> 31:09.760\n but I've always dreamed about like putting,\n\n31:10.880 --> 31:15.680\n I always dreamed of having this world full of robots.\n\n31:15.680 --> 31:20.240\n And every time I would bring these ideas up,\n\n31:20.240 --> 31:21.960\n they'll be shut down by the different people,\n\n31:21.960 --> 31:26.960\n by my parents, by, then you need to first get an education.\n\n31:28.080 --> 31:30.840\n You need to succeed in these dimensions.\n\n31:30.840 --> 31:32.080\n In order to do all these things,\n\n31:32.080 --> 31:33.200\n you have to get good grades.\n\n31:33.200 --> 31:34.680\n You have to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n31:34.680 --> 31:38.240\n Like there's all this stuff that it's indirect\n\n31:38.240 --> 31:41.720\n or direct ways of blowing out that little ridiculous dream\n\n31:41.720 --> 31:43.240\n that you present.\n\n31:43.240 --> 31:46.960\n And it's like, I remember sort of bringing up,\n\n31:46.960 --> 31:51.960\n I don't know, things like becoming a state champion\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:54.320\n in wrestling, right?\n\n31:56.320 --> 32:00.080\n It's a weird dance because of course the coaches will tell,\n\n32:00.080 --> 32:02.200\n they'll kind of dismiss that.\n\n32:02.200 --> 32:04.760\n It's like, okay, okay.\n\n32:04.760 --> 32:07.640\n But at the same time, it feels like in those early days,\n\n32:07.640 --> 32:10.800\n you have to preserve that little fire.\n\n32:10.800 --> 32:12.480\n Johnny Ive, I don't know if you know who that is,\n\n32:12.480 --> 32:13.840\n is a designer at Apple.\n\n32:13.840 --> 32:14.760\n He was a chief designer.\n\n32:14.760 --> 32:17.560\n He's behind most of the iPhone, all that stuff.\n\n32:17.560 --> 32:21.000\n And he always talked about that he wouldn't bring his ideas\n\n32:21.000 --> 32:23.280\n to Steve Jobs until they were matured\n\n32:23.280 --> 32:25.440\n because he would always shit on them.\n\n32:25.440 --> 32:30.040\n He wanted them to as little babies live for a little bit\n\n32:30.040 --> 32:31.880\n before they get completely shut down.\n\n32:31.880 --> 32:33.840\n And I always think about that when I see a beginner\n\n32:33.840 --> 32:37.200\n sort of bragging on Instagram, you have to be careful.\n\n32:37.200 --> 32:39.640\n Let them play with that little dream.\n\n32:40.960 --> 32:43.400\n Are you playing with a little dream that you're nurturing\n\n32:43.400 --> 32:44.960\n and you're trying to take that little flame\n\n32:44.960 --> 32:48.240\n and you're trying to create a roaring blaze with it?\n\n32:48.240 --> 32:50.680\n Or are you playing with the idea of it\n\n32:50.680 --> 32:54.120\n and behind that there's no substance?\n\n32:54.120 --> 32:55.160\n It's hard to know the difference.\n\n32:55.160 --> 32:56.600\n That's what I struggle with.\n\n32:56.600 --> 32:58.000\n I don't think it necessarily is.\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.160\n Certainly you're wrong.\n\n32:59.160 --> 33:01.440\n And when I say Instagram,\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:03.880\n I don't wanna impugn a bunch of strangers,\n\n33:03.880 --> 33:05.560\n but I have a gym with a lot of members.\n\n33:05.560 --> 33:07.680\n And I can tell you that the number of years\n\n33:07.680 --> 33:08.720\n I've been in the gym,\n\n33:08.720 --> 33:11.000\n when someone comes to me and says, this is my goal,\n\n33:11.000 --> 33:15.200\n I don't tell them yes or no in general, but I know.\n\n33:15.200 --> 33:17.320\n I can tell by the way they say it to me,\n\n33:17.320 --> 33:18.680\n I can thin slice it.\n\n33:18.680 --> 33:20.600\n I've seen the look on people's faces.\n\n33:20.600 --> 33:24.360\n And when people start to say they wanna do X, Y, and Z,\n\n33:24.360 --> 33:26.120\n I know right off the bat,\n\n33:26.120 --> 33:27.720\n this person's either gonna put an effort in\n\n33:27.720 --> 33:29.600\n or they're not going to put an effort in.\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:33.640\n So to me, it's about the effort behind that.\n\n33:33.640 --> 33:36.160\n If you're busting your ass and you're a new at something\n\n33:36.160 --> 33:38.480\n and you're brand new, but you're working really hard\n\n33:38.480 --> 33:42.480\n and you have a series of like moderate successes in that,\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:44.280\n like that's the guy I wanna champion\n\n33:44.280 --> 33:47.280\n because that persistence and that grit over time,\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:49.760\n those successes will no longer be moderate.\n\n33:49.760 --> 33:51.040\n They'll be huge.\n\n33:51.040 --> 33:52.720\n But the person who's having moderate success\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:55.600\n by doing nothing, chances are they'll never learn\n\n33:55.600 --> 33:58.920\n to put that work in and the successes will never grow.\n\n33:58.920 --> 34:01.560\n You have an admiration for Mike Tyson.\n\n34:01.560 --> 34:02.400\n I love him.\n\n34:03.640 --> 34:06.080\n I'm just gonna let that sit for a brief moment.\n\n34:06.080 --> 34:09.240\n So why?\n\n34:09.240 --> 34:10.640\n I think there's a combination of factors.\n\n34:10.640 --> 34:13.400\n One is like the timeliness of his career\n\n34:13.400 --> 34:17.520\n and like the age I was when he like came to prominence,\n\n34:18.920 --> 34:23.000\n the raw, brutal violence\n\n34:23.000 --> 34:26.520\n and the raw, brutal honesty when he speaks.\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:29.640\n I think it's easy for people to hear him or see his life\n\n34:29.640 --> 34:33.120\n and cast him aside as some simianesque,\n\n34:33.120 --> 34:36.160\n like just cretin scourge on society.\n\n34:36.160 --> 34:37.640\n But when you hear him speak,\n\n34:37.640 --> 34:40.160\n like this is not a guy who's unintelligent.\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:42.280\n This is a guy who knows himself better\n\n34:42.280 --> 34:44.640\n than probably most of us know ourselves.\n\n34:44.640 --> 34:48.840\n It's disarming and that's a humongous part\n\n34:48.840 --> 34:52.440\n of my admiration for him.\n\n34:52.440 --> 34:54.000\n Who is Mike Tyson?\n\n34:54.000 --> 34:56.640\n Because it feels like there's similarities\n\n34:56.640 --> 34:58.000\n between him and you.\n\n34:59.160 --> 35:02.880\n It feels like there's a violent person in there,\n\n35:02.880 --> 35:04.760\n but also a really kind person.\n\n35:04.760 --> 35:07.800\n And they're all like living together in a little house.\n\n35:07.800 --> 35:08.760\n And you're the same.\n\n35:08.760 --> 35:10.400\n There's a thoughtful person,\n\n35:10.400 --> 35:12.600\n but there's also a scary, violent person.\n\n35:12.600 --> 35:14.560\n And they're like having a picnic.\n\n35:14.560 --> 35:16.040\n They're having a picnic.\n\n35:16.040 --> 35:18.760\n I think there are dialectical tensions in everyone,\n\n35:18.760 --> 35:21.160\n these like opposing forces\n\n35:21.160 --> 35:22.880\n that are constantly pulling at you\n\n35:22.880 --> 35:24.560\n and at different points in your life,\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:26.360\n like it's sliding scale.\n\n35:26.360 --> 35:31.360\n And I think that certainly when I was a younger person,\n\n35:31.360 --> 35:35.120\n that there was a lot more manifestation of the violence\n\n35:35.120 --> 35:37.360\n and a lot less of the kindness.\n\n35:38.880 --> 35:40.520\n People who were not as close to me\n\n35:40.520 --> 35:42.280\n probably saw more of the violent side\n\n35:42.280 --> 35:44.680\n and only the very close people to me saw like\n\n35:44.680 --> 35:46.640\n what would pass for the kind side.\n\n35:46.640 --> 35:49.720\n And now that's sliding in the other direction.\n\n35:49.720 --> 35:52.200\n And I worry actually sometimes that\n\n35:53.520 --> 35:55.200\n there could be a situation where I need\n\n35:55.200 --> 35:57.280\n that old version of me\n\n35:57.280 --> 35:59.280\n and he's getting further and further away\n\n35:59.280 --> 36:01.840\n and I can't call him up if I need him.\n\n36:01.840 --> 36:05.640\n And that concerns me to a certain degree.\n\n36:07.160 --> 36:12.160\n The sad aging warrior seeing his greater self fade away.\n\n36:12.400 --> 36:13.800\n But you still compete.\n\n36:13.800 --> 36:15.200\n Does that person return?\n\n36:15.200 --> 36:16.440\n It seems like for Mike Tyson,\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:20.040\n that person returned at the prospect of competition.\n\n36:20.040 --> 36:23.400\n It returns, but I've learned better\n\n36:23.400 --> 36:26.040\n how to manifest it in competition\n\n36:26.040 --> 36:27.600\n in terms of like the effects\n\n36:27.600 --> 36:29.800\n that that type of emotion has on you physically\n\n36:29.800 --> 36:31.200\n in the middle of a competition.\n\n36:31.200 --> 36:34.400\n So I've better learned how to utilize that energy.\n\n36:34.400 --> 36:36.960\n But I think another side effect of this\n\n36:36.960 --> 36:39.440\n is like having a gym where you're a bigger guy\n\n36:39.440 --> 36:40.920\n and you're the head instructor,\n\n36:40.920 --> 36:43.880\n you can't be as mean and violent as you once were\n\n36:43.880 --> 36:46.400\n because you're also not trying to run a business.\n\n36:46.400 --> 36:51.160\n And you spend so many years trying not to be mean\n\n36:51.160 --> 36:54.520\n and to soften your technique a little bit\n\n36:54.520 --> 36:56.640\n that that all of a sudden just becomes who you are.\n\n36:56.640 --> 36:58.520\n And I don't necessarily like that.\n\n36:58.520 --> 37:00.760\n So I've been trying to reclaim that a little bit\n\n37:00.760 --> 37:05.560\n on the mat, but I think in competition,\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:13.720\n there has to be an athlete really wants to score the points.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.560\n A fighter really wants to incapacitate you\n\n37:18.560 --> 37:20.240\n and put you in a position where they can\n\n37:20.240 --> 37:21.600\n do their own bidding.\n\n37:21.600 --> 37:23.680\n And the result in a jujitsu match\n\n37:23.680 --> 37:25.560\n might just still be two points,\n\n37:25.560 --> 37:28.320\n but the motivations are very, very different.\n\n37:28.320 --> 37:30.480\n What do you make of Tyson on Joe Rogan\n\n37:30.480 --> 37:32.560\n saying that he was aroused by violence?\n\n37:32.560 --> 37:34.120\n Do you think that's insane?\n\n37:34.120 --> 37:36.720\n Do you think that's deeply honest for him?\n\n37:36.720 --> 37:40.280\n And do you think that rings true for many of us,\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:43.120\n others who practices in different degrees?\n\n37:43.120 --> 37:45.800\n I can't speak for a lot of people.\n\n37:45.800 --> 37:48.840\n And I think that it was a brutally honest statement by him.\n\n37:48.840 --> 37:51.640\n And I think it's something that even if a lot of people\n\n37:51.640 --> 37:53.720\n feel it, they're not that comfortable\n\n37:53.720 --> 37:55.600\n admitting it or saying it.\n\n37:55.600 --> 38:00.600\n But I think there's great joy\n\n38:01.480 --> 38:05.800\n in landing a flush right hand on someone's jaw\n\n38:05.800 --> 38:07.320\n and then watching them crumble.\n\n38:07.320 --> 38:08.480\n You don't even feel it.\n\n38:08.480 --> 38:10.240\n You ever played baseball as a kid?\n\n38:10.240 --> 38:11.960\n You can hit a base hit off the end of the bat\n\n38:11.960 --> 38:13.360\n and it will sting your hands\n\n38:13.360 --> 38:15.120\n because of the way that you hit it.\n\n38:15.120 --> 38:18.360\n You can hit a home run and you won't feel anything.\n\n38:18.360 --> 38:19.840\n It just feels so good in your hands.\n\n38:19.840 --> 38:24.840\n And that's, I think, one of the joys of physical contact.\n\n38:25.160 --> 38:27.040\n When you do it the right way,\n\n38:27.040 --> 38:29.160\n and that goes for all physical contact.\n\n38:29.160 --> 38:30.960\n When you do it the right way,\n\n38:30.960 --> 38:33.600\n the physical pleasure you can derive from it\n\n38:33.600 --> 38:38.080\n and the mental pleasure, it's unparalleled.\n\n38:38.080 --> 38:39.400\n See, but that's different.\n\n38:39.400 --> 38:40.920\n Let me draw a distinction.\n\n38:40.920 --> 38:41.760\n I'm not,\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:47.560\n I've had the fortune of being a wrestler.\n\n38:47.560 --> 38:50.520\n And I would draw a distinction\n\n38:50.520 --> 38:54.640\n between a very well executed in competition,\n\n38:54.640 --> 38:57.960\n double leg, single leg take down or a pin.\n\n38:57.960 --> 38:59.600\n There's some, as an OCD person,\n\n38:59.600 --> 39:01.800\n there's something so comforting\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:03.520\n about a well executed pin\n\n39:03.520 --> 39:05.040\n because it's like two seconds\n\n39:05.040 --> 39:07.640\n and it's just like everything is flush and nice.\n\n39:07.640 --> 39:09.360\n And like, it's all clean.\n\n39:09.360 --> 39:13.280\n I mean, okay, this OCD person who likes to align show,\n\n39:13.280 --> 39:14.360\n it's just beautiful.\n\n39:14.360 --> 39:16.120\n Okay, that's good technique.\n\n39:16.120 --> 39:19.440\n And wrestling also provides you,\n\n39:20.680 --> 39:22.560\n maybe more than other sports,\n\n39:22.560 --> 39:25.680\n the feeling of dominating another human.\n\n39:25.680 --> 39:26.520\n Yes.\n\n39:26.520 --> 39:30.720\n Of breaking, no, not just of them being very cocky\n\n39:30.720 --> 39:32.240\n and very powerful,\n\n39:32.240 --> 39:34.880\n you feel this power of another human being\n\n39:34.880 --> 39:37.440\n and then you breaking them.\n\n39:37.440 --> 39:42.440\n And like, I'm not as honest as Mike Tyson.\n\n39:42.440 --> 39:47.440\n But that, I don't think I've ever sort of looked in the mirror\n\n39:48.200 --> 39:53.120\n and said like, that that was, I enjoyed that aspect of it.\n\n39:53.120 --> 39:56.400\n But it certainly seems like you chase that.\n\n39:56.400 --> 39:58.440\n So when I was a wrestler in high school,\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:04.080\n I lost so many matches because of over aggressiveness.\n\n40:05.040 --> 40:08.400\n Like, I would pick the top position and let you stand\n\n40:08.400 --> 40:10.160\n just so that I could do a mat return.\n\n40:10.160 --> 40:12.200\n And I wasn't trying to return you to the mat.\n\n40:12.200 --> 40:15.360\n I was actually trying to like drive you through the mat\n\n40:15.360 --> 40:16.280\n and through the ground.\n\n40:16.280 --> 40:20.600\n Like I took, like, it gave me joy to do that.\n\n40:20.600 --> 40:23.200\n Like, it wasn't like I was trying to, you know,\n\n40:23.200 --> 40:25.600\n just return you to the mat so that I could pin you.\n\n40:25.600 --> 40:26.920\n That what you just talked about,\n\n40:26.920 --> 40:28.880\n like the dominating another person,\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:30.920\n I used to look at that as you've got someone\n\n40:30.920 --> 40:32.280\n who in theory is equally trained\n\n40:32.280 --> 40:34.080\n and equally skilled as you are.\n\n40:34.080 --> 40:38.320\n And you're absolutely out there totally dominating them.\n\n40:38.320 --> 40:39.880\n There's joy in that.\n\n40:39.880 --> 40:41.800\n You could get in an MMA fight\n\n40:41.800 --> 40:44.920\n and you could take someone down and you could mount them.\n\n40:44.920 --> 40:47.160\n And all that feels great.\n\n40:47.160 --> 40:49.160\n But when you start raining down the punches\n\n40:49.160 --> 40:52.000\n on their face from mount and like dropping elbows and stuff,\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:55.080\n like there's another level of satisfaction there.\n\n40:55.080 --> 40:57.440\n And it's tough to describe.\n\n40:57.440 --> 41:01.320\n And I don't think that everyone is made for it.\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:03.920\n When I was, I think when I was a senior in high school,\n\n41:03.920 --> 41:05.480\n my wrestling coach said, look,\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:09.160\n you've got to stop with all this crazy aggressive wrestling.\n\n41:09.160 --> 41:12.080\n Like they tried to turn me into a technician\n\n41:12.080 --> 41:15.240\n and it did work to a degree.\n\n41:15.240 --> 41:18.760\n And it was a humongous shift for me in terms of success,\n\n41:18.760 --> 41:22.400\n but it wasn't the same level of enjoyment out of it.\n\n41:23.680 --> 41:25.920\n Like, I mean, I got disqualified from New England\n\n41:25.920 --> 41:28.080\n because my coach said cross face and I cross face\n\n41:28.080 --> 41:29.040\n and he said harder.\n\n41:29.040 --> 41:31.400\n And I basically wound up and blasted a kid in the face\n\n41:31.400 --> 41:33.760\n and his nose got busted everywhere.\n\n41:33.760 --> 41:37.360\n But I didn't think not to do it because that felt good.\n\n41:37.360 --> 41:39.560\n It felt good to cross face him like that.\n\n41:39.560 --> 41:41.360\n I was a lot of like.\n\n41:42.600 --> 41:46.560\n That's a weird American warrior ethos that I've picked up,\n\n41:46.560 --> 41:49.920\n but I also have in me the Russian, the Setyaev brothers\n\n41:49.920 --> 41:53.720\n that don't see it, don't see it as that.\n\n41:53.720 --> 41:55.280\n They don't get draw,\n\n41:56.480 --> 42:00.480\n they think that there is a tension between the art\n\n42:00.480 --> 42:04.520\n of the martial art and the violence of the martial art.\n\n42:04.520 --> 42:05.360\n I agree with that.\n\n42:05.360 --> 42:06.840\n It's a poetic way I could put it,\n\n42:06.840 --> 42:10.200\n but they're not so fascinated with this Dan Gable\n\n42:10.200 --> 42:12.040\n dominating another human.\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:17.040\n They think of the effortlessness of the technique\n\n42:18.760 --> 42:20.600\n and your mastery of the art is exhibited\n\n42:20.600 --> 42:22.360\n in its effortlessness,\n\n42:22.360 --> 42:25.080\n how much you lose yourself in the moment and the timing,\n\n42:25.080 --> 42:27.200\n that just the beauty of a timing.\n\n42:27.200 --> 42:30.480\n Like there's much more, like one example in judo,\n\n42:30.480 --> 42:33.920\n but also in wrestling, you can look at the foot sweep.\n\n42:33.920 --> 42:38.320\n Wrestlers in America and even judo players in America\n\n42:38.320 --> 42:40.840\n and much of the world don't admire the beauty\n\n42:40.840 --> 42:43.680\n of the foot sweep, but a well timed foot sweep,\n\n42:43.680 --> 42:45.760\n which is a way to sort of off balance\n\n42:45.760 --> 42:48.720\n to find the right timing to just effortlessly\n\n42:50.280 --> 42:53.800\n change the table, turn the tables of,\n\n42:53.800 --> 42:58.480\n I mean, dominate your opponent is seen as the highest form\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:00.840\n of mastery in Russian wrestling.\n\n43:00.840 --> 43:04.280\n In the case of judo, it's in Japanese judo.\n\n43:04.280 --> 43:05.160\n It's interesting.\n\n43:05.160 --> 43:06.000\n I'm not sure.\n\n43:06.000 --> 43:08.560\n I'm not sure what that tension is about.\n\n43:08.560 --> 43:11.000\n I think it actually takes me back to,\n\n43:11.880 --> 43:13.720\n I don't know if you listened to Dan Carlin,\n\n43:13.720 --> 43:17.360\n Hardcore History and Genghis Khan, if you've ever.\n\n43:17.360 --> 43:19.640\n I've read a great, great book.\n\n43:19.640 --> 43:20.480\n On Genghis Khan?\n\n43:20.480 --> 43:21.320\n Yeah.\n\n43:21.320 --> 43:23.200\n I'm still trying to adjust.\n\n43:23.200 --> 43:25.440\n Most of my life said Genghis Khan,\n\n43:25.440 --> 43:30.440\n but the right pronunciation is actually Genghis Khan.\n\n43:31.080 --> 43:32.920\n There's a tension there.\n\n43:32.920 --> 43:35.120\n We kind of think, I don't know we,\n\n43:35.120 --> 43:40.120\n I kind of thought as Genghis Khan is a ultra violent,\n\n43:41.440 --> 43:45.920\n a leader of ultra violent men, but another view,\n\n43:45.920 --> 43:50.920\n another way to see them is the people who warriors\n\n43:50.920 --> 43:55.920\n that valued extreme competence and mastery of the art\n\n43:58.600 --> 44:00.920\n of fighting with weapons, with bows,\n\n44:00.920 --> 44:03.480\n with the horse riding, all that kind of stuff.\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:07.480\n And I'm not sure exactly where to place them\n\n44:07.480 --> 44:12.480\n on my sort of thinking about violence in our human history.\n\n44:12.800 --> 44:16.880\n I think in the context of like combat sports,\n\n44:16.880 --> 44:19.080\n I think there's a difference between an athlete\n\n44:19.080 --> 44:22.280\n winning a contest under a certain set of rules\n\n44:22.280 --> 44:26.280\n and a fighter winning a fight under those exact same rules.\n\n44:26.280 --> 44:28.400\n There's a different approach to it.\n\n44:28.400 --> 44:31.000\n And I don't think one is any better than the other.\n\n44:32.080 --> 44:34.480\n Like in MMA, I think a great example would be\n\n44:35.560 --> 44:37.000\n George St. Pierre.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:40.120\n George St. Pierre is a tremendous athlete\n\n44:40.120 --> 44:43.440\n and he considers himself to be a martial artist first.\n\n44:43.440 --> 44:45.960\n He's trying to win an athletic competition.\n\n44:45.960 --> 44:49.560\n Like Nick Diaz is trying to bust your ass, right?\n\n44:49.560 --> 44:51.360\n There's a different approach to it.\n\n44:51.360 --> 44:53.200\n And yes, they've had different results\n\n44:53.200 --> 44:55.400\n at the highest level of competition,\n\n44:55.400 --> 44:59.040\n but it's difficult to attribute the difference in results\n\n44:59.040 --> 45:00.520\n just to their approach to the sport\n\n45:00.520 --> 45:01.680\n because they're different human beings\n\n45:01.680 --> 45:05.080\n with different abilities and different physical attributes.\n\n45:06.960 --> 45:09.640\n The PsyTF brothers have that luxury of being able\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:14.360\n to talk about the beauty of a perfectly timed slide by.\n\n45:14.360 --> 45:16.120\n There are other wrestlers that will never be able\n\n45:16.120 --> 45:18.760\n to pull that off and therefore they have to pursue\n\n45:18.760 --> 45:20.960\n other ways to defeat someone.\n\n45:20.960 --> 45:24.040\n And maybe it is the Dan Gable breaking a man's spirit\n\n45:24.040 --> 45:25.400\n by outworking him type thing,\n\n45:25.400 --> 45:27.480\n which is beautiful in its own way.\n\n45:28.720 --> 45:33.240\n But we tend to self select the ways in which\n\n45:33.240 --> 45:35.000\n we're able to be successful\n\n45:35.000 --> 45:37.440\n and then kind of take a deep dive into that.\n\n45:37.440 --> 45:39.760\n What do you think is more beautiful?\n\n45:39.760 --> 45:44.760\n Brute force or effortless execution\n\n45:46.440 --> 45:49.560\n of a technique that dominates another human?\n\n45:49.560 --> 45:52.160\n I think it's a subjective thing\n\n45:52.160 --> 45:55.360\n based on what skills you perceive yourself to have.\n\n45:55.360 --> 45:59.720\n I'm never, I've never been a slick, super athletic,\n\n45:59.720 --> 46:02.400\n dexterous competitor in anything.\n\n46:02.400 --> 46:04.320\n And I've always been more of an,\n\n46:04.320 --> 46:06.080\n I've gotta outwork you, I've gotta out grind you,\n\n46:06.080 --> 46:07.400\n I gotta out mean you.\n\n46:07.400 --> 46:09.520\n And so because I've lived that,\n\n46:09.520 --> 46:11.520\n I tend to see the beauty in that more\n\n46:11.520 --> 46:13.680\n because I have a perceptual awareness\n\n46:13.680 --> 46:16.480\n that I don't have for the people who have the luxury\n\n46:16.480 --> 46:18.080\n of being very slick and athletic\n\n46:18.080 --> 46:20.760\n and using beautiful technique.\n\n46:20.760 --> 46:23.800\n Now that said, there's a phenomenal little video\n\n46:23.800 --> 46:28.800\n the other day I sent to a friend of a compilation\n\n46:29.040 --> 46:32.000\n of foot sweeps by Leota Machida in MMA.\n\n46:32.000 --> 46:34.800\n And they're so beautiful and they're so awesome.\n\n46:34.800 --> 46:38.040\n And it's not that I don't have an appreciation for those,\n\n46:38.040 --> 46:39.840\n but I can't emulate those because I lack\n\n46:39.840 --> 46:42.520\n the physical ability to do that.\n\n46:42.520 --> 46:46.280\n Whereas I at least have a chance to emulate\n\n46:46.280 --> 46:48.760\n some of the people who do it through grit\n\n46:48.760 --> 46:51.040\n and through outworking people.\n\n46:51.040 --> 46:54.400\n But I would love to return to Genghis Khan\n\n46:54.400 --> 46:56.680\n and get your thoughts about,\n\n46:56.680 --> 46:59.400\n like I have so many mixed feelings\n\n46:59.400 --> 47:04.400\n about whether he is evil or not,\n\n47:04.400 --> 47:09.400\n whether the violence that he brought to the world\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:12.840\n had ultimately, the fact that it had maybe\n\n47:14.440 --> 47:16.800\n kind of like Dan Carlin describes,\n\n47:16.800 --> 47:19.280\n cleanse the landscape.\n\n47:19.280 --> 47:22.160\n It's like a reset for the world through violence\n\n47:22.160 --> 47:27.160\n had ultimately a progressive effect on human civilization,\n\n47:29.640 --> 47:33.680\n even though in the short term it led to massive,\n\n47:33.680 --> 47:36.160\n you could say suffering.\n\n47:36.160 --> 47:38.360\n I don't know what to make of that, man.\n\n47:38.360 --> 47:40.680\n What are your thoughts on Genghis Khan?\n\n47:40.680 --> 47:44.400\n I think it's always difficult to look at a historical figure\n\n47:44.400 --> 47:48.120\n and their actions of their time through a modern day lens\n\n47:48.120 --> 47:53.120\n because it's easy for us to kind of impugn\n\n47:54.480 --> 47:56.720\n their achievements and the things that they did\n\n47:56.720 --> 48:00.600\n and say, oh, well, what he did was wrong.\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:02.720\n Well, of course that can be true,\n\n48:02.720 --> 48:04.680\n but a lot of times we don't actually have\n\n48:04.680 --> 48:06.960\n any real good context or concept\n\n48:06.960 --> 48:09.520\n of the times they were living in\n\n48:09.520 --> 48:11.920\n and what really was deemed wrong and what really wasn't.\n\n48:11.920 --> 48:14.160\n We're looking at it through a very cushy modern lens.\n\n48:14.160 --> 48:18.560\n That being said, from what I've read about Genghis Khan,\n\n48:18.560 --> 48:19.760\n yeah, he was a violent dude,\n\n48:19.760 --> 48:21.280\n but also he gave you an option.\n\n48:22.360 --> 48:24.040\n When he got to a village, he said,\n\n48:24.040 --> 48:29.040\n look, you have a choice,\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:31.680\n you can come with us or you can run.\n\n48:31.680 --> 48:36.440\n And he gave them an option to join his legion of fighters\n\n48:36.440 --> 48:38.080\n who he took very good care of.\n\n48:38.080 --> 48:41.200\n He was the first military leader\n\n48:41.200 --> 48:45.600\n to pay his soldiers families when they died.\n\n48:45.600 --> 48:48.720\n And he did that based on the booty that they got\n\n48:48.720 --> 48:50.840\n when they raided a village.\n\n48:50.840 --> 48:52.480\n He took that money, he took his share\n\n48:52.480 --> 48:54.080\n and they divided that up amongst the soldiers\n\n48:54.080 --> 48:55.560\n and then the soldiers families.\n\n48:55.560 --> 49:02.560\n I think he also is credited with first horseback mail routes\n\n49:02.560 --> 49:03.720\n or something like that, right?\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:06.680\n Isn't he the godfather of the modern postal system?\n\n49:06.680 --> 49:08.080\n There's something like that.\n\n49:08.080 --> 49:13.080\n Yeah, he's the Bernie Sanders of the Mongol Empire.\n\n49:14.520 --> 49:18.920\n I do think the offering of surrender is an interesting one\n\n49:18.920 --> 49:23.920\n because it's interesting as a thought experiment,\n\n49:23.920 --> 49:26.040\n whether you would sacrifice your way of,\n\n49:26.040 --> 49:28.640\n like the pride of nations or the nationalism,\n\n49:28.640 --> 49:30.000\n pride of your country,\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:35.000\n whether you're willing to give that up to survive.\n\n49:38.120 --> 49:40.600\n It depends on who depends on you.\n\n49:40.600 --> 49:44.520\n If you have a family and young kids and stuff like that,\n\n49:44.520 --> 49:47.600\n I think your obligation is primarily to them\n\n49:47.600 --> 49:49.560\n and therefore surrender has to be something\n\n49:49.560 --> 49:52.400\n that you consider in that moment in time\n\n49:52.400 --> 49:55.480\n so that you can take care of those people.\n\n49:55.480 --> 49:57.680\n If you're a man alone and you've got all these principles\n\n49:57.680 --> 50:00.240\n and all this other stuff and you're not down\n\n50:00.240 --> 50:02.640\n with what Genghis Khan is doing and what he's selling,\n\n50:02.640 --> 50:04.320\n yeah, try and escape, do your thing\n\n50:04.320 --> 50:06.920\n and just know what waits on the other side of that\n\n50:06.920 --> 50:08.080\n for you potentially.\n\n50:08.080 --> 50:09.960\n But I think if there's someone else out there\n\n50:09.960 --> 50:13.120\n that depends on you, your obligation should be to them.\n\n50:13.120 --> 50:17.640\n It feels like historically people valued principles\n\n50:17.640 --> 50:22.640\n more than life in this weight of like,\n\n50:22.720 --> 50:23.840\n what do I value more?\n\n50:23.840 --> 50:26.520\n The principles I hold versus survival.\n\n50:26.520 --> 50:30.280\n It seems that now we don't value principles as much.\n\n50:30.280 --> 50:31.760\n Principles could be also religion,\n\n50:31.760 --> 50:33.720\n it could be your values, whatever.\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:36.520\n We're okay sort of sacrificing those\n\n50:36.520 --> 50:38.680\n for to preserve our survival.\n\n50:38.680 --> 50:42.040\n And that applies in all forms like actual survival\n\n50:42.040 --> 50:46.920\n or like on social media, like preserving your reputation,\n\n50:46.920 --> 50:48.480\n all those kinds of things.\n\n50:48.480 --> 50:52.720\n It seems like we, especially in America,\n\n50:52.720 --> 50:57.240\n value individual life,\n\n50:57.240 --> 51:00.560\n that death is somehow a really bad thing.\n\n51:00.560 --> 51:04.120\n As opposed to saying sacrificing your principles\n\n51:04.120 --> 51:06.800\n is a very bad thing and everybody dies\n\n51:06.800 --> 51:08.840\n and it's okay to die.\n\n51:08.840 --> 51:12.120\n What's horrible is to sacrifice your principles\n\n51:12.120 --> 51:15.880\n of who you are just to live another day.\n\n51:15.880 --> 51:17.840\n I think a big problem is people don't really even know\n\n51:17.840 --> 51:19.600\n what their principles are anymore.\n\n51:19.600 --> 51:24.600\n People, social media and just the way that we live nowadays\n\n51:26.080 --> 51:29.320\n where we're separated from the human contact like this,\n\n51:29.320 --> 51:33.480\n like you're not contacting people in a community anymore.\n\n51:33.480 --> 51:35.840\n You're not, whether you're religious or not,\n\n51:35.840 --> 51:37.800\n like you're not congregating at a church,\n\n51:37.800 --> 51:39.000\n you're not part of a parish\n\n51:39.000 --> 51:41.160\n like you would be like in down South,\n\n51:41.160 --> 51:44.080\n you're not part of that community anymore.\n\n51:44.080 --> 51:48.440\n And so it's difficult to figure out\n\n51:48.440 --> 51:50.360\n what your principles and values are\n\n51:50.360 --> 51:52.560\n because you're constantly jumping from one bucket\n\n51:52.560 --> 51:55.360\n to the next online.\n\n51:55.360 --> 51:58.160\n And you don't get a lot of like direct,\n\n51:58.160 --> 52:01.160\n like reasonable feedback from people.\n\n52:01.160 --> 52:02.640\n You just get dipshit feedback.\n\n52:02.640 --> 52:03.880\n Like, oh, you don't believe this?\n\n52:03.880 --> 52:04.960\n Well, you're a jerk.\n\n52:04.960 --> 52:07.680\n I think the hard thing currently\n\n52:07.680 --> 52:09.440\n is having the integrity and character\n\n52:09.440 --> 52:11.280\n to stick by principles one under.\n\n52:11.280 --> 52:15.720\n I don't want to equate murder in the Genghis Khan times\n\n52:15.720 --> 52:19.040\n to social media cancel culture,\n\n52:19.040 --> 52:20.800\n but it certainly doesn't feel good\n\n52:20.800 --> 52:22.840\n when people are attacking on social media.\n\n52:22.840 --> 52:25.720\n And it does take a lot of integrity to,\n\n52:26.840 --> 52:28.960\n without anger, without emotion,\n\n52:28.960 --> 52:33.960\n without mocking others or attacking others unfairly,\n\n52:34.680 --> 52:38.920\n standing by the ideas you hold,\n\n52:38.920 --> 52:43.920\n or in another way, standing by your friends,\n\n52:45.160 --> 52:47.160\n standing by this little group,\n\n52:47.160 --> 52:51.760\n like loyalty of the people that you know are good people.\n\n52:51.760 --> 52:54.200\n I find that in cancel culture,\n\n52:54.200 --> 52:57.120\n one of the sad things is whenever somebody gets\n\n52:57.120 --> 52:59.240\n quote unquote canceled,\n\n52:59.240 --> 53:02.640\n everybody just gets all their friends become really quiet\n\n53:02.640 --> 53:06.280\n and don't defend them or worse.\n\n53:06.280 --> 53:08.960\n I mean, quiet is at least understandable.\n\n53:08.960 --> 53:12.960\n They kind of signal that they throw them out of the bus,\n\n53:12.960 --> 53:14.960\n I guess is one way to put it.\n\n53:14.960 --> 53:18.360\n And that's something I think about a lot\n\n53:18.360 --> 53:20.540\n because from coming from me, it's like,\n\n53:22.240 --> 53:23.880\n I hold an ethic.\n\n53:23.880 --> 53:25.480\n I don't know if others hold this ethic.\n\n53:25.480 --> 53:30.480\n Maybe it's this like Russian mobster ethic of like,\n\n53:30.480 --> 53:34.440\n you should help your friends bury the body.\n\n53:34.440 --> 53:36.680\n You shouldn't criticize your friends for committing\n\n53:36.680 --> 53:37.560\n the murder.\n\n53:37.560 --> 53:39.440\n Like there are certain levels of like,\n\n53:40.680 --> 53:43.880\n yeah, you have that discussion after you buried the body\n\n53:43.880 --> 53:47.360\n that like maybe you shouldn't have done that murder thing.\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:50.880\n I don't know, I understand that that's a problematic,\n\n53:51.880 --> 53:54.320\n what's the terminology?\n\n53:54.320 --> 53:57.120\n That's a problematic ethical framework\n\n53:57.120 --> 53:58.080\n within which to operate.\n\n53:58.080 --> 54:00.880\n But at the same time, it feels like what else do we have\n\n54:00.880 --> 54:04.240\n in this world except the brotherhood, the sisterhood,\n\n54:04.240 --> 54:06.600\n the love we have for a very small community.\n\n54:06.600 --> 54:08.200\n But perhaps that's the wrong way of thinking.\n\n54:08.200 --> 54:11.240\n Perhaps the 21st century would be defined\n\n54:11.240 --> 54:13.180\n by the dissipation of this community,\n\n54:13.180 --> 54:14.880\n of this loyalty concept.\n\n54:14.880 --> 54:16.560\n No, we're all just individuals.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:17.400\n I think you're right.\n\n54:17.400 --> 54:20.080\n And I think you have to have some sort of core framework\n\n54:20.080 --> 54:22.840\n of principles and beliefs that you operate on.\n\n54:22.840 --> 54:26.880\n And I think what I was referencing is a little bit different.\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:28.960\n But to speak to your point,\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:33.960\n you need a framework of core principles\n\n54:34.360 --> 54:38.440\n on which you can then base a lot of your other decisions.\n\n54:38.440 --> 54:40.480\n Like I believe these three things to be true,\n\n54:40.480 --> 54:41.480\n whatever they are,\n\n54:41.480 --> 54:43.400\n and that will help inform other decisions\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:44.500\n you make in your life.\n\n54:45.600 --> 54:48.980\n As far as how you treat your friends,\n\n54:48.980 --> 54:52.560\n I've got probably three friends that,\n\n54:52.560 --> 54:53.880\n if they called me right now and said,\n\n54:53.880 --> 54:56.460\n let's bury the body, sorry, Lex, I gotta go.\n\n54:56.460 --> 55:00.700\n There are other people in my life that if they said,\n\n55:00.700 --> 55:02.420\n hey, we've got to go bury the body,\n\n55:02.420 --> 55:03.660\n I would say, who is this?\n\n55:06.700 --> 55:09.980\n So I think it depends on the relationship.\n\n55:09.980 --> 55:12.180\n I wonder if that's a good, that's a really good measure.\n\n55:12.180 --> 55:14.100\n I would love to have,\n\n55:14.100 --> 55:15.980\n I would love that to be in your profile.\n\n55:15.980 --> 55:17.620\n People put like pronouns.\n\n55:17.620 --> 55:22.220\n I would love to put like, honestly, like objectively,\n\n55:22.220 --> 55:24.820\n not self report, but objective,\n\n55:24.820 --> 55:28.380\n how many people in your life, if they committed murder,\n\n55:28.380 --> 55:29.820\n you would not ask any questions\n\n55:29.820 --> 55:31.900\n and you would help them hide the body.\n\n55:31.900 --> 55:33.940\n Like, I would love to know that number for people.\n\n55:33.940 --> 55:35.900\n Yeah, and I think it's a weird thing too,\n\n55:35.900 --> 55:37.620\n because you think right away, like, okay,\n\n55:37.620 --> 55:39.920\n it must be the group of people that are the closest to you.\n\n55:39.920 --> 55:41.860\n That's who you're first thinking of, right?\n\n55:41.860 --> 55:44.140\n But obviously for like my best friend,\n\n55:44.140 --> 55:45.820\n I would do it, no question about it.\n\n55:45.820 --> 55:47.660\n But I've got other people that are close to me\n\n55:47.660 --> 55:50.580\n that are close to me in other ways.\n\n55:50.580 --> 55:52.100\n And I probably wouldn't do that only\n\n55:52.100 --> 55:54.220\n because I don't think they'd do it for me.\n\n55:54.220 --> 55:55.060\n Yeah.\n\n55:55.060 --> 55:57.660\n And that is a consideration.\n\n55:57.660 --> 55:59.900\n So I guess, is the principle there\n\n55:59.900 --> 56:02.020\n then that you do for your friends\n\n56:02.020 --> 56:03.420\n what you think they would do for you?\n\n56:03.420 --> 56:05.260\n Is that the underlying principle?\n\n56:05.260 --> 56:06.900\n Or do you just have a blind loyalty\n\n56:06.900 --> 56:10.540\n to people in your life for different reasons?\n\n56:10.540 --> 56:12.700\n I got people that are not on my inner circle\n\n56:12.700 --> 56:15.740\n that I probably wouldn't help change a tire\n\n56:15.740 --> 56:17.340\n at two in the morning if they're on the highway.\n\n56:17.340 --> 56:18.340\n But if they called me and said,\n\n56:18.340 --> 56:20.780\n hey, we gotta bury the body, I might show up for that.\n\n56:20.780 --> 56:22.420\n It's just these weird different connections you have.\n\n56:22.420 --> 56:23.340\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n56:23.340 --> 56:25.980\n Yeah, I have close friends that like,\n\n56:25.980 --> 56:28.460\n I'd probably be, exactly, the tire is a good example.\n\n56:28.460 --> 56:31.460\n I'd be like, can't you find somebody else to do this?\n\n56:31.460 --> 56:35.980\n I think part of that is just this leap of faith\n\n56:35.980 --> 56:39.900\n into like giving yourself to the other person\n\n56:39.900 --> 56:43.820\n that creates a deep connection\n\n56:43.820 --> 56:48.820\n that makes life fulfilling, like meaningful\n\n56:49.140 --> 56:51.580\n that doesn't exist if you don't take that leap.\n\n56:51.580 --> 56:52.820\n I mean, it's not about the murder.\n\n56:52.820 --> 56:53.900\n We're sort of focusing.\n\n56:53.900 --> 56:57.060\n I think that's a, I think you have to,\n\n56:57.060 --> 56:59.020\n what is it, cross that bridge when you get there.\n\n56:59.020 --> 57:00.060\n I'm not exactly sure.\n\n57:00.060 --> 57:01.820\n This is just a thought experiment.\n\n57:01.820 --> 57:05.140\n But it's, I think about that a lot,\n\n57:05.140 --> 57:06.700\n especially these COVID times.\n\n57:06.700 --> 57:09.420\n And as like people become more and more isolated\n\n57:09.420 --> 57:11.060\n and separated from each other,\n\n57:11.060 --> 57:14.780\n like how important is it to have those deep connections\n\n57:14.780 --> 57:16.420\n to other humans?\n\n57:16.420 --> 57:18.540\n I think especially like what you're talking about there.\n\n57:18.540 --> 57:20.220\n Have you ever seen the movie, The Town?\n\n57:20.220 --> 57:21.500\n There's a great line in the movie\n\n57:21.500 --> 57:23.420\n where one of the main characters\n\n57:23.420 --> 57:26.340\n walks into his friend's house and he says,\n\n57:26.340 --> 57:27.380\n I need your help.\n\n57:28.380 --> 57:29.860\n We're gonna go hurt some people\n\n57:29.860 --> 57:31.900\n and you can never ask me about it again.\n\n57:31.900 --> 57:33.340\n And the friend looks up and he says,\n\n57:33.340 --> 57:34.540\n whose car are we taking?\n\n57:35.620 --> 57:38.180\n Like that is the type of person you need in your life.\n\n57:38.180 --> 57:40.180\n And the people, like there are people\n\n57:40.180 --> 57:41.980\n that will walk through that door and say that to you\n\n57:41.980 --> 57:43.340\n and you drop everything you're doing.\n\n57:43.340 --> 57:44.700\n And then there's the people that walk through your door\n\n57:44.700 --> 57:45.660\n and you're like, you know what?\n\n57:45.660 --> 57:47.460\n I got a hot pocket in the microwave.\n\n57:49.460 --> 57:50.860\n I'm a little bit tied up right now,\n\n57:50.860 --> 57:52.060\n but I'd love to help you out.\n\n57:52.060 --> 57:54.500\n But you know, I don't wanna do that.\n\n57:54.500 --> 57:57.220\n And you don't have that deep connection with those people.\n\n57:57.220 --> 57:58.980\n You mentioned some principles\n\n57:58.980 --> 58:02.340\n that you've changed your mind on.\n\n58:02.340 --> 58:04.740\n Is there, do you wanna go there?\n\n58:04.740 --> 58:07.620\n Is there some interesting principles\n\n58:07.620 --> 58:11.940\n and the process of changing that is useful to talk about?\n\n58:11.940 --> 58:14.420\n I can't really cite a specific thing,\n\n58:14.420 --> 58:18.700\n except that understanding that the principles\n\n58:18.700 --> 58:20.740\n that you have at different points in your life\n\n58:20.740 --> 58:22.460\n can change and it's okay to change them\n\n58:22.460 --> 58:23.620\n without being a total pussy\n\n58:23.620 --> 58:25.140\n and being bullied by other people\n\n58:25.140 --> 58:27.180\n into thinking what you thought was wrong.\n\n58:27.180 --> 58:30.420\n If you come to these conclusions of your own volition\n\n58:30.420 --> 58:32.220\n and you decide to change them, that's great.\n\n58:32.220 --> 58:36.300\n And it can be really, it can be really liberating.\n\n58:36.300 --> 58:38.100\n It's really liberating to have an idea\n\n58:38.100 --> 58:43.100\n that you hold so true to your core belief system\n\n58:45.220 --> 58:47.980\n and then to actually have someone change your mind for you\n\n58:47.980 --> 58:50.780\n and be okay with it, as opposed to being like, no,\n\n58:50.780 --> 58:52.500\n I gotta die with this.\n\n58:52.500 --> 58:53.340\n I gotta die with this.\n\n58:53.340 --> 58:54.180\n It's really liberating.\n\n58:54.180 --> 58:56.020\n There are definitely are ideas you wanna die on that hill\n\n58:56.020 --> 58:58.340\n and no one's ever gonna change your mind.\n\n58:58.340 --> 59:02.100\n But it's really liberating to be confident enough\n\n59:02.100 --> 59:03.940\n to say, change my mind.\n\n59:03.940 --> 59:06.380\n I'm lucky enough to have some smart motherfuckers around me\n\n59:06.380 --> 59:10.060\n who can tell me, listen, you're being a total dipshit.\n\n59:10.060 --> 59:12.380\n Like let's rethink this.\n\n59:12.380 --> 59:15.380\n Or like I have one friend who does the five whys all the time\n\n59:15.380 --> 59:17.300\n and he loves backing me into a corner.\n\n59:17.300 --> 59:18.140\n And.\n\n59:18.140 --> 59:19.060\n What's the five whys?\n\n59:19.060 --> 59:20.940\n You just, like when someone makes a statement\n\n59:20.940 --> 59:24.100\n about something, to really get to the core issue,\n\n59:24.100 --> 59:27.940\n they say, if you ask why five times, make a statement,\n\n59:27.940 --> 59:29.140\n well, why is that?\n\n59:29.140 --> 59:30.820\n And you answer that, well, why?\n\n59:30.820 --> 59:32.700\n And you phrase the whys differently, obviously,\n\n59:32.700 --> 59:33.820\n but then you get to the core.\n\n59:33.820 --> 59:36.660\n They say five times, you can get to the core of the issue.\n\n59:36.660 --> 59:38.220\n And that's a challenging thing.\n\n59:38.220 --> 59:41.460\n But I find later in life, it's so liberating for me\n\n59:41.460 --> 59:43.500\n to be confident enough to be like,\n\n59:43.500 --> 59:46.820\n man, was I fucking way off the mark on this\n\n59:46.820 --> 59:48.060\n and have my mind changed.\n\n59:48.060 --> 59:50.780\n And be able to say that to others that I was wrong.\n\n59:50.780 --> 59:51.740\n Totally.\n\n59:51.740 --> 59:54.980\n That ability, and I never used to have that.\n\n59:54.980 --> 59:58.300\n And it feels real good.\n\n59:58.300 --> 59:59.940\n And there's a hunger for that too.\n\n1:00:00.900 --> 1:00:03.260\n Yeah, you're so right, actually, on a personal level,\n\n1:00:03.260 --> 1:00:05.180\n it feels very good.\n\n1:00:05.180 --> 1:00:07.420\n Exactly as you said, it's liberating\n\n1:00:07.420 --> 1:00:10.860\n because you're free to then think as opposed to.\n\n1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:11.700\n Defend.\n\n1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:14.020\n Yeah, without thinking.\n\n1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:16.580\n Yeah, you get so sick of defending the same thing\n\n1:00:16.580 --> 1:00:18.060\n over and over and over.\n\n1:00:18.060 --> 1:00:20.700\n And you start to think about it and it's like,\n\n1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:25.380\n well, I would really like to evolve my thought process here.\n\n1:00:25.380 --> 1:00:29.020\n And when you're constantly defending one point,\n\n1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:31.380\n it's difficult to let other ideas in.\n\n1:00:31.380 --> 1:00:34.700\n You discount the possibility\n\n1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:35.940\n that you can have your mind changed\n\n1:00:35.940 --> 1:00:37.740\n when you're constantly on the defense.\n\n1:00:37.740 --> 1:00:39.980\n You have to have a crack in the front line\n\n1:00:39.980 --> 1:00:43.380\n in order to let a new idea come in and possibly flourish.\n\n1:00:43.380 --> 1:00:46.900\n And maybe the new idea doesn't even prove your current\n\n1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:48.340\n belief system to be wrong,\n\n1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:51.940\n but maybe it's like the water to a seed and it grows\n\n1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:54.180\n and now it's something even bigger and better.\n\n1:00:54.180 --> 1:00:57.060\n And you can start to work with that instead.\n\n1:00:57.060 --> 1:00:59.780\n And it's a tough thing because I'm a stubborn fuck\n\n1:00:59.780 --> 1:01:03.140\n and it's very difficult for me, it was historically,\n\n1:01:03.140 --> 1:01:05.060\n to say I was wrong about this one,\n\n1:01:05.060 --> 1:01:06.420\n or I messed this one up,\n\n1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:08.740\n or I wish I could have that one back.\n\n1:01:09.660 --> 1:01:11.820\n There's a public figure for me thing too,\n\n1:01:11.820 --> 1:01:16.180\n which there's a difference between changing your mind\n\n1:01:16.180 --> 1:01:17.700\n with a small circle of friends\n\n1:01:17.700 --> 1:01:20.740\n and changing your mind publicly about something,\n\n1:01:20.740 --> 1:01:23.740\n but it has equal, one echoes the other.\n\n1:01:23.740 --> 1:01:25.180\n It is equally liberating,\n\n1:01:25.180 --> 1:01:30.180\n but people will not make that change easy,\n\n1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:32.420\n but it doesn't matter.\n\n1:01:32.420 --> 1:01:34.180\n That's the point.\n\n1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:38.540\n I think it's ultimately liberating as a human being,\n\n1:01:38.540 --> 1:01:43.540\n public figure or not to just think deeply about this world\n\n1:01:43.580 --> 1:01:47.020\n and to keep changing, which is like,\n\n1:01:47.020 --> 1:01:49.140\n I think there's a deep hunger for that\n\n1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:51.060\n in like political discourse,\n\n1:01:51.060 --> 1:01:55.460\n that people are so tribal currently about politics\n\n1:01:55.460 --> 1:01:58.100\n that they want to see somebody who says,\n\n1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:00.860\n you know what, I changed my mind on this.\n\n1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:03.820\n And then keep changing their mind and keep asking questions,\n\n1:02:03.820 --> 1:02:05.340\n keep showing that they're open minded,\n\n1:02:05.340 --> 1:02:06.180\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:10.100\n But when you want someone in a position of political power\n\n1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:12.340\n to change their mind because they realize\n\n1:02:12.340 --> 1:02:13.700\n that there might be a better way,\n\n1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:15.980\n not because they realize that by changing their mind,\n\n1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:18.100\n they're gonna get a new demographic to vote for them.\n\n1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:19.660\n Like that's transparent as shit.\n\n1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:21.020\n Nobody wants to see that.\n\n1:02:21.020 --> 1:02:26.020\n Like that's a person who can't separate their position\n\n1:02:26.020 --> 1:02:27.660\n from their people they're supposed to be helping.\n\n1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:29.140\n Yeah, and you can usually smell that.\n\n1:02:29.140 --> 1:02:34.140\n That's, we're just talking offline about,\n\n1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:36.140\n there's something about Hillary Clinton\n\n1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:40.380\n where she talked about changing her mind on gay marriage\n\n1:02:40.380 --> 1:02:44.900\n that it felt like this is a political calculation\n\n1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:47.980\n versus like really deeply thinking about like,\n\n1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:52.980\n what things do we do in this world\n\n1:02:53.060 --> 1:02:55.060\n that violate basic human rights?\n\n1:02:55.060 --> 1:02:56.900\n Like really thinking about deeply.\n\n1:02:56.900 --> 1:03:00.380\n And of course politicians are calculating this,\n\n1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:01.700\n but you can see it.\n\n1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:02.540\n This is the thing.\n\n1:03:02.540 --> 1:03:06.220\n That's why I like on the human level,\n\n1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.800\n there's like political policies, but there's also humans.\n\n1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.320\n And I've always liked Bernie Sanders, for example.\n\n1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:13.680\n I don't know, not the later perhaps Bernie Sanders,\n\n1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.540\n but I used to listen to him back in the day.\n\n1:03:15.540 --> 1:03:18.820\n And it felt that people might disagree with me,\n\n1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:22.300\n but it felt like there was a real human struggling\n\n1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:25.500\n with ideas, whatever, agree with him or not,\n\n1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:27.860\n it felt like he wasn't doing political calculation.\n\n1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:28.740\n He was just a human.\n\n1:03:28.740 --> 1:03:32.180\n He couldn't be further away from my political ideals,\n\n1:03:32.180 --> 1:03:36.180\n but also like, there's an obvious authenticity\n\n1:03:36.180 --> 1:03:38.540\n to his passion for what he's saying\n\n1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:40.780\n that is not present in other candidates.\n\n1:03:40.780 --> 1:03:42.260\n And you could see it,\n\n1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:44.500\n all these people that have been in politics forever,\n\n1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:45.820\n like from all the way back\n\n1:03:45.820 --> 1:03:47.860\n when Hillary was a lawyer in the 70s.\n\n1:03:47.860 --> 1:03:49.700\n There's a couple of shots of her in a courtroom\n\n1:03:49.700 --> 1:03:52.500\n in the 70s though, she's looking all right.\n\n1:03:52.500 --> 1:03:53.980\n She's got those big glasses on.\n\n1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:57.220\n She's kind of a little bit of a nerdy babe back in the day.\n\n1:03:57.220 --> 1:03:58.380\n Oh, you mean like.\n\n1:03:58.380 --> 1:03:59.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:59.220 --> 1:04:03.460\n Well, John Clark says Hillary Clinton was a babe\n\n1:04:03.460 --> 1:04:04.300\n back in the day.\n\n1:04:04.300 --> 1:04:05.620\n 73 Clinton, yeah.\n\n1:04:05.620 --> 1:04:10.620\n That's an interesting question\n\n1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:12.300\n about authenticity in politicians.\n\n1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:15.300\n Do you think like Hillary Clinton,\n\n1:04:15.300 --> 1:04:17.340\n just the Clintons in general are a good example\n\n1:04:17.340 --> 1:04:21.700\n that why do you think they become over time so inauthentic?\n\n1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.420\n Is it the system that changes them?\n\n1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:25.460\n Is it their own hunger for power?\n\n1:04:25.460 --> 1:04:29.860\n Is it, what is it, or are they always inauthentic?\n\n1:04:29.860 --> 1:04:31.300\n Well, first I'd like to say that,\n\n1:04:31.300 --> 1:04:32.140\n I don't know if you know this,\n\n1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:35.820\n but I come from a bit of a political dynasty myself.\n\n1:04:36.740 --> 1:04:38.900\n I was on the student government several times\n\n1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:42.220\n in high school and my dad won the runoff\n\n1:04:42.220 --> 1:04:45.260\n in a special election in Bradenton Beach, Florida.\n\n1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:47.540\n I think there's like 700 people there.\n\n1:04:47.540 --> 1:04:48.380\n So.\n\n1:04:48.380 --> 1:04:49.660\n So your dad got you the job?\n\n1:04:49.660 --> 1:04:51.660\n Yeah, we're basically,\n\n1:04:51.660 --> 1:04:54.100\n a lot of people compare us to the Kennedys.\n\n1:04:54.100 --> 1:04:56.540\n My guess with the politicians is that,\n\n1:04:56.540 --> 1:04:59.700\n and you can see it now as we're becoming more cognizant\n\n1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:02.140\n as people to the political process,\n\n1:05:02.140 --> 1:05:04.300\n I think the process corrupts people.\n\n1:05:04.300 --> 1:05:06.980\n And I think that, I don't know the ins and outs of it.\n\n1:05:06.980 --> 1:05:09.300\n I've listened to people who are far more educated\n\n1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:11.940\n on it than me and I'm unprepared to cite\n\n1:05:11.940 --> 1:05:13.420\n any of their points.\n\n1:05:14.500 --> 1:05:16.820\n I think you can see it a little bit in Dan Crenshaw.\n\n1:05:16.820 --> 1:05:17.660\n Can I say this?\n\n1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:19.620\n Yeah, I like him.\n\n1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:21.500\n I really liked Dan,\n\n1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.540\n especially like a year, year and a half ago.\n\n1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:25.900\n He seemed very level headed.\n\n1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:28.620\n It's clear to me now that as he panders\n\n1:05:28.620 --> 1:05:30.140\n more and more to the right,\n\n1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:33.980\n it's because he's setting himself for a presidential run.\n\n1:05:33.980 --> 1:05:35.620\n It's clear that that's happening.\n\n1:05:35.620 --> 1:05:38.060\n And he just doesn't seem like the same authentic\n\n1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:42.380\n ideals oriented guy that he did a year and a half ago.\n\n1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:43.540\n Now I could be wrong on that.\n\n1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:44.580\n It could be way off.\n\n1:05:44.580 --> 1:05:46.980\n But I think that you can take someone\n\n1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:49.260\n as honest as you want to.\n\n1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:52.540\n When you start them on that path to the presidency,\n\n1:05:52.540 --> 1:05:56.180\n you become so unbelievably beholden\n\n1:05:56.180 --> 1:05:58.820\n to so many people and entities along the way\n\n1:05:59.860 --> 1:06:02.460\n that by the time you get to the final destination,\n\n1:06:02.460 --> 1:06:05.500\n the Oval Office, all you're doing is paying back\n\n1:06:05.500 --> 1:06:06.940\n the favors that got you there.\n\n1:06:06.940 --> 1:06:08.460\n And you never get to serve the people\n\n1:06:08.460 --> 1:06:09.820\n you're supposed to serve.\n\n1:06:09.820 --> 1:06:12.460\n Your primary focus is on your office\n\n1:06:12.460 --> 1:06:15.140\n and not on the people that you're supposed to be helping.\n\n1:06:15.140 --> 1:06:17.020\n And I think that that's a humongous problem.\n\n1:06:17.020 --> 1:06:19.780\n And like we could talk all about campaign finance reform\n\n1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:20.980\n and the two party system.\n\n1:06:20.980 --> 1:06:22.580\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:06:22.580 --> 1:06:26.420\n the people who are running for political posts,\n\n1:06:27.300 --> 1:06:29.060\n they're working to keep a job.\n\n1:06:29.060 --> 1:06:30.700\n They're not working to improve the lives\n\n1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.340\n of the constituents, which is different.\n\n1:06:33.340 --> 1:06:36.060\n A long, long time ago, like a lot of politicians,\n\n1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:38.340\n those were like part time jobs.\n\n1:06:38.340 --> 1:06:40.780\n And they held other posts out West.\n\n1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:43.420\n They were ranchers by day and sheriff by night,\n\n1:06:43.420 --> 1:06:44.780\n whatever the case might be.\n\n1:06:44.780 --> 1:06:48.460\n But now, such a cushy path for the rest of your life\n\n1:06:48.460 --> 1:06:51.060\n that the goal is to just be a politician,\n\n1:06:51.060 --> 1:06:53.060\n not do the things that you think a politician\n\n1:06:53.060 --> 1:06:54.620\n is supposed to do.\n\n1:06:54.620 --> 1:06:55.460\n And that's a problem.\n\n1:06:55.460 --> 1:06:58.660\n By the way, I'll talk to Dan on this.\n\n1:06:58.660 --> 1:07:02.340\n It's funny, I like the version of him from a year ago\n\n1:07:02.340 --> 1:07:03.740\n and I haven't been really paying attention.\n\n1:07:03.740 --> 1:07:07.140\n So I'll be, I'll actually pay more attention now\n\n1:07:07.140 --> 1:07:08.780\n and ask him that exact question.\n\n1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:11.500\n Like, how do you prevent yourself from changing,\n\n1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:14.140\n becoming what the Clintons became?\n\n1:07:14.140 --> 1:07:16.460\n I tend to believe like there's conspiratorial stuff\n\n1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:17.860\n about Clintons and all these politicians.\n\n1:07:17.860 --> 1:07:19.820\n I tend to believe that they were actually\n\n1:07:19.820 --> 1:07:21.660\n good, thoughtful people back in the day.\n\n1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:23.780\n And the system changes them.\n\n1:07:25.060 --> 1:07:26.340\n It's not even the system.\n\n1:07:27.340 --> 1:07:30.620\n There's something about just the process of campaigning.\n\n1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:33.380\n I just think it wears you down to where\n\n1:07:33.380 --> 1:07:35.920\n if you look at the percentage of time you spend\n\n1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:38.380\n on the kinds of conversations you have,\n\n1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:41.720\n it's like one, you do these speeches,\n\n1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:43.980\n which you repeat the same thing over and over and over.\n\n1:07:43.980 --> 1:07:47.620\n It beats the process of thinking.\n\n1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:49.340\n You just exhaust your brain to where\n\n1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:51.260\n you're not thinking anymore, you're just repeating.\n\n1:07:51.260 --> 1:07:54.020\n It's very, it's exceptionally difficult\n\n1:07:54.020 --> 1:07:57.580\n to keep making speech after speech after speech,\n\n1:07:57.580 --> 1:07:59.920\n saying the same thing over and over and over again,\n\n1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:01.900\n and at the same time thinking deeply\n\n1:08:01.900 --> 1:08:04.020\n and changing your mind and learning.\n\n1:08:04.020 --> 1:08:07.780\n And then also the pandering to financial,\n\n1:08:07.780 --> 1:08:10.180\n like having phone calls, like fundraising,\n\n1:08:10.180 --> 1:08:11.460\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:12.300\n That's what they do now.\n\n1:08:12.300 --> 1:08:13.820\n They spend most of their time fundraising.\n\n1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:15.620\n They're not worried about anything.\n\n1:08:15.620 --> 1:08:16.960\n Sorry to interrupt you, but I was gonna say\n\n1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:19.500\n that you can see there's a fuel.\n\n1:08:19.500 --> 1:08:24.500\n Like the more attention and the higher regard\n\n1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:26.260\n you're held in in your community,\n\n1:08:26.260 --> 1:08:28.860\n and the more sycophants like continue\n\n1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:30.460\n to blow smoke up your ass,\n\n1:08:30.460 --> 1:08:32.860\n the more it changes the way you present yourself.\n\n1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:35.100\n And you can see it in every walk of life.\n\n1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:37.620\n I mean, jiu jitsu is a tiny, tiny little section\n\n1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:40.200\n of the world, but you see it in the jiu jitsu community.\n\n1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:42.500\n When someone all of a sudden starts a social media page\n\n1:08:42.500 --> 1:08:44.500\n or whatever, and they get a bunch of people,\n\n1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:48.140\n like basically like cyber fellating them\n\n1:08:48.140 --> 1:08:51.220\n on their Instagram page, they change.\n\n1:08:51.220 --> 1:08:52.660\n Fellating, is that a word?\n\n1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:53.500\n I think so.\n\n1:08:53.500 --> 1:08:54.860\n So giving fellatio?\n\n1:08:54.860 --> 1:08:55.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:55.700 --> 1:08:56.600\n So fellating.\n\n1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:57.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:58.340\n Jamie, look it up.\n\n1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:03.500\n I think, but in those people, it changes their character.\n\n1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:04.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:04.340 --> 1:09:06.860\n It changes who they are because they become emboldened\n\n1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:09.980\n and now they've got this like mythical cyber mob\n\n1:09:09.980 --> 1:09:11.340\n behind them.\n\n1:09:11.340 --> 1:09:13.620\n There's a sign at the entrance to your gym\n\n1:09:13.620 --> 1:09:16.660\n that reads, for every moment of triumph,\n\n1:09:16.660 --> 1:09:19.260\n it's a quote by Hunter S. Thompson.\n\n1:09:19.260 --> 1:09:21.300\n It reads, for every moment of triumph,\n\n1:09:21.300 --> 1:09:25.460\n for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.\n\n1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:28.620\n What does this quote mean to you?\n\n1:09:29.940 --> 1:09:33.240\n That quote to me is about, mostly about sacrifice.\n\n1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:38.260\n And it's about to achieve anything great\n\n1:09:38.260 --> 1:09:41.220\n or anything beautiful or to triumph,\n\n1:09:41.220 --> 1:09:44.620\n you have to have sacrificed so many things to get there,\n\n1:09:44.620 --> 1:09:48.340\n unless you're the most unbelievably genetically gifted person\n\n1:09:48.340 --> 1:09:51.500\n in the world and greatness is just, you know,\n\n1:09:51.500 --> 1:09:53.920\n falls upon you, it's just raining from the sky.\n\n1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:58.260\n I think on your path to greatness,\n\n1:09:58.260 --> 1:10:00.360\n on your path to success and triumph,\n\n1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:02.460\n you leave a lot of carnage in your wake,\n\n1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:04.840\n personal relationships, other goals,\n\n1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:08.540\n things that you didn't pursue, you know,\n\n1:10:08.540 --> 1:10:10.060\n other unfulfilled dreams.\n\n1:10:10.060 --> 1:10:12.260\n And you kind of have to sell a lot of that out\n\n1:10:12.260 --> 1:10:17.260\n in order to be really at the peak of your field\n\n1:10:18.180 --> 1:10:20.200\n or what you want to be.\n\n1:10:22.060 --> 1:10:23.440\n I know that that's happened in my life.\n\n1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:26.820\n I mean, there's tons and tons of relationships\n\n1:10:26.820 --> 1:10:31.100\n that, you know, couldn't survive the way\n\n1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:31.980\n that I was living my life,\n\n1:10:31.980 --> 1:10:34.420\n because when I was trying to be a big time fighter\n\n1:10:34.420 --> 1:10:36.900\n or like when I was just training all the time,\n\n1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:41.020\n tons of relationships dissolve themselves naturally,\n\n1:10:41.020 --> 1:10:43.100\n some not so naturally.\n\n1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:44.740\n Some people get it, some people don't get it,\n\n1:10:44.740 --> 1:10:49.260\n some people hate you, you miss tons of other opportunities.\n\n1:10:49.260 --> 1:10:51.600\n And I think that's kind of what that quote means to me.\n\n1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:52.740\n It's about sacrifice.\n\n1:10:52.740 --> 1:10:57.180\n It's about you're giving up what you want now\n\n1:10:57.180 --> 1:10:58.460\n for what you want more.\n\n1:11:01.100 --> 1:11:05.780\n And it's the trampling of souls, it's messy too,\n\n1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:09.880\n because it's not clear what the right path is.\n\n1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:13.500\n Like that sacrifice is not obvious\n\n1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:16.660\n that those are the right sacrifices to make.\n\n1:11:16.660 --> 1:11:19.820\n You might be ruining your own life,\n\n1:11:19.820 --> 1:11:22.980\n but the fact that you're willing to take that risk\n\n1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:27.980\n and sort of go all in on whether it's stupid or not,\n\n1:11:29.700 --> 1:11:31.280\n go all in on something,\n\n1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:35.700\n that the possibility of creating something beautiful\n\n1:11:35.700 --> 1:11:36.540\n is there.\n\n1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:37.660\n Who says it's stupid?\n\n1:11:37.660 --> 1:11:40.060\n If you're going all in on it, you don't think it's stupid.\n\n1:11:40.060 --> 1:11:41.780\n Someone else might think it's stupid,\n\n1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:44.020\n but I mean, who really cares?\n\n1:11:44.020 --> 1:11:46.460\n Well, I'm of many minds on many things,\n\n1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:49.380\n so I feel like there's certain minds,\n\n1:11:49.380 --> 1:11:52.220\n certain moves of the day where you think it's stupid.\n\n1:11:52.220 --> 1:11:54.020\n Like relationships is a beautiful one,\n\n1:11:54.020 --> 1:11:56.980\n which is, you've seen the movie Whiplash, by any chance?\n\n1:11:56.980 --> 1:11:57.820\n Yes.\n\n1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:02.820\n It seems like in a man's life,\n\n1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:06.620\n or it could be a woman's, but I don't identify as a woman,\n\n1:12:06.620 --> 1:12:08.900\n so I know the man, the lived experience.\n\n1:12:08.900 --> 1:12:10.380\n It's 2020, bro.\n\n1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:13.780\n But my lived experience for now is that of a man.\n\n1:12:13.780 --> 1:12:15.220\n We'll see about tomorrow.\n\n1:12:15.220 --> 1:12:19.940\n And there is, in the pursuit of excellence,\n\n1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:22.620\n there's often a choice of,\n\n1:12:24.540 --> 1:12:26.420\n some of the souls that must be trampled\n\n1:12:26.420 --> 1:12:29.640\n are personal relationships with humans in your life\n\n1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:30.940\n that you might deeply care about.\n\n1:12:30.940 --> 1:12:33.420\n It could be family, it could be friends,\n\n1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:36.780\n it could be loved ones of all different forms.\n\n1:12:36.780 --> 1:12:40.140\n It could be the people that, your colleagues\n\n1:12:40.140 --> 1:12:42.840\n that are dependent on you, people who will lose jobs\n\n1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:45.820\n because of the decisions you make, all this kind of stuff.\n\n1:12:45.820 --> 1:12:48.660\n It seems that that moment happens,\n\n1:12:48.660 --> 1:12:52.100\n and I'm not sure that sacrifice is always the correct one.\n\n1:12:52.100 --> 1:12:53.960\n Like, to me, the movie Whiplash,\n\n1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:56.780\n for people who haven't seen, spoiler alert, maybe?\n\n1:12:56.780 --> 1:13:00.260\n I don't even know if that movie has any spoilers,\n\n1:13:00.260 --> 1:13:02.860\n but there is a relationship with a female.\n\n1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:04.860\n There's a student, there's a drummer\n\n1:13:04.860 --> 1:13:06.380\n that's pursuing excellence\n\n1:13:06.380 --> 1:13:09.380\n of this particular art form of drumming,\n\n1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:14.380\n and he has a brief, fleeting relationship with a female,\n\n1:13:14.780 --> 1:13:16.400\n and he also has an instructor\n\n1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:18.380\n that's pushing him to his limits\n\n1:13:18.380 --> 1:13:20.460\n in what appears to be awfully a lot\n\n1:13:20.460 --> 1:13:22.820\n like a toxic relationship.\n\n1:13:22.820 --> 1:13:26.780\n And he chooses, not chooses,\n\n1:13:26.780 --> 1:13:31.180\n he naturally makes the decision\n\n1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:34.780\n to sacrifice the romantic relationship with the woman\n\n1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:39.380\n in further pursuit of this chaos of,\n\n1:13:39.380 --> 1:13:41.420\n this chaotic pursuit of excellence.\n\n1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:45.520\n And that doesn't feel like a deliberate decision.\n\n1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:49.120\n It feels like a giant mess of like an emotional mess\n\n1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:50.360\n where you're just like,\n\n1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:55.420\n kind of like a fish swimming against stream,\n\n1:13:55.420 --> 1:13:57.560\n just like, fuck it.\n\n1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:00.760\n You let go of all the things that convention says\n\n1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.300\n you should appreciate.\n\n1:14:02.300 --> 1:14:04.780\n You throw away the possibility of a stable life,\n\n1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:05.840\n of a comfortable life,\n\n1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:10.140\n of what society says is a meaningful life,\n\n1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:12.180\n and just pursue this crazy thing\n\n1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:14.980\n full of seeming toxicity\n\n1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:16.920\n with crazy people surrounding you.\n\n1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:17.760\n I don't know.\n\n1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:19.460\n So I don't know what the right decision is.\n\n1:14:19.460 --> 1:14:22.620\n Part of my brain says, you should stay with the girl.\n\n1:14:22.620 --> 1:14:26.060\n Fuck that instructor that's making you,\n\n1:14:26.060 --> 1:14:29.180\n that's pushing you to places where it's like,\n\n1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:31.240\n that are destructive, potentially destructive,\n\n1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:32.780\n like could lead to suicide,\n\n1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:36.060\n could lead you to completely\n\n1:14:39.820 --> 1:14:43.920\n fail or fail on your pursuit of excellence\n\n1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:47.100\n or destroy the dream,\n\n1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:48.740\n the passionate pursuit of the thing\n\n1:14:48.740 --> 1:14:50.060\n that you've always dreamed for,\n\n1:14:50.060 --> 1:14:51.440\n in that case is drumming.\n\n1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:52.280\n I don't know.\n\n1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:53.220\n There's so many minds there.\n\n1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:54.500\n Like what is the right thing to do?\n\n1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:55.700\n So my first two thoughts are,\n\n1:14:55.700 --> 1:14:58.300\n number one, fuck convention.\n\n1:14:58.300 --> 1:14:59.260\n What is convention?\n\n1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:01.660\n It's like some laid out path,\n\n1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:03.620\n some linear progression of the way your life\n\n1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:04.820\n is supposed to go,\n\n1:15:04.820 --> 1:15:07.620\n like that someone can draw a picture of at the end.\n\n1:15:07.620 --> 1:15:11.940\n That shit's, first of all, it's just boring and whatever.\n\n1:15:11.940 --> 1:15:14.720\n And it's, I don't wanna say that it's cowardly\n\n1:15:14.720 --> 1:15:16.100\n because it isn't cowardly,\n\n1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:18.500\n but for someone who's not conventional\n\n1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:21.060\n to not be nonconventional is cowardly,\n\n1:15:21.060 --> 1:15:22.660\n to get sucked into the convention.\n\n1:15:22.660 --> 1:15:23.540\n That's first.\n\n1:15:23.540 --> 1:15:24.900\n Second of all,\n\n1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:28.420\n I believe that scene in the diner in that movie\n\n1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:30.700\n where he tells her you're in my way\n\n1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:33.680\n because I'm gonna want to be with you,\n\n1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:35.940\n or you're going to want me to be going out to dinner\n\n1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:37.640\n with you and I know I should be practicing,\n\n1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:39.100\n or I know I should be training.\n\n1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:40.640\n And ultimately I'm gonna make,\n\n1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:43.340\n I'm either gonna feel bad about not being with you\n\n1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:44.180\n by training,\n\n1:15:44.180 --> 1:15:46.040\n or I'm gonna skip the training to be with you\n\n1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:47.660\n and neither one is right.\n\n1:15:47.660 --> 1:15:49.500\n The whole thing that they don't mention in that\n\n1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:51.060\n is that that's the wrong girl.\n\n1:15:51.980 --> 1:15:53.140\n That's the wrong girl.\n\n1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:55.840\n The right girl is a gangster.\n\n1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:59.860\n The right girl says, oh, you've practiced tonight?\n\n1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:01.820\n I'll leave you a sandwich and some milk\n\n1:16:01.820 --> 1:16:04.740\n so that you can, outside the door,\n\n1:16:04.740 --> 1:16:05.760\n let me know when you're done,\n\n1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.740\n or you have some free time.\n\n1:16:07.740 --> 1:16:09.400\n The right girl compliments that.\n\n1:16:09.400 --> 1:16:11.780\n She's not an impediment in any way.\n\n1:16:11.780 --> 1:16:16.340\n Even if what you wanna do is be with her so much\n\n1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:17.620\n that you're putting the drums down,\n\n1:16:17.620 --> 1:16:18.700\n or you're putting the bass down,\n\n1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:19.860\n or you're picking up the pizza,\n\n1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:22.340\n or you're not going to training,\n\n1:16:22.340 --> 1:16:24.660\n that girl, without even telling you\n\n1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:26.280\n why she's making decisions,\n\n1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:29.400\n is making decisions to help you achieve your goal.\n\n1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:32.880\n Now that might sound like some sort of chauvinistic\n\n1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:34.360\n king of the castle type shit\n\n1:16:34.360 --> 1:16:36.180\n where everyone should cater to you,\n\n1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:37.860\n but the fact of the matter is\n\n1:16:40.700 --> 1:16:42.940\n that person is a compliment to your life\n\n1:16:42.940 --> 1:16:44.740\n in helping you do your thing,\n\n1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:46.620\n and in your own way you're helping them\n\n1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:48.860\n to achieve whatever their goals are also.\n\n1:16:48.860 --> 1:16:51.860\n It's uncommon that you have two people under the same roof\n\n1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:56.620\n striving to be unbelievably excellent in one small area.\n\n1:16:56.620 --> 1:16:59.460\n It's not impossible, but it's uncommon.\n\n1:16:59.460 --> 1:17:01.900\n Relationships have to be like binary systems,\n\n1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:03.260\n like two stars.\n\n1:17:03.260 --> 1:17:05.800\n The gravitational pull is what keeps you together\n\n1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:08.060\n and circling around one another, right?\n\n1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:11.180\n And one is bigger than the other,\n\n1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:12.420\n and they'll fluctuate,\n\n1:17:12.420 --> 1:17:14.380\n and the stars will get bigger,\n\n1:17:14.380 --> 1:17:15.220\n and they'll get smaller,\n\n1:17:15.220 --> 1:17:19.780\n and they'll contract based on positioning and composition.\n\n1:17:19.780 --> 1:17:21.700\n That's the way a relationship should be,\n\n1:17:21.700 --> 1:17:24.420\n not an asteroid coming in to disrupt\n\n1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:27.100\n the surface of your planet.\n\n1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:28.820\n It's a binary system, it's a compliment.\n\n1:17:28.820 --> 1:17:30.740\n That girl was the wrong girl for him.\n\n1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:31.720\n So you shouldn't,\n\n1:17:32.660 --> 1:17:35.220\n like the big unconventional dreams\n\n1:17:36.220 --> 1:17:41.220\n should not be adjusted to fit into this world.\n\n1:17:41.260 --> 1:17:42.860\n Because I mean, there is a part of me\n\n1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:43.940\n that's like full of self thought,\n\n1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:45.740\n well, maybe you're just a dick.\n\n1:17:45.740 --> 1:17:46.580\n Maybe.\n\n1:17:46.580 --> 1:17:48.020\n Yeah, who cares?\n\n1:17:48.020 --> 1:17:49.900\n Lex, so first of all,\n\n1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:52.820\n who cares?\n\n1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:55.240\n This is, by the way, somebody who's,\n\n1:17:56.580 --> 1:17:58.660\n you have recently gotten,\n\n1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:01.540\n well, in the span of the history of the universe\n\n1:18:01.540 --> 1:18:03.140\n is recently you've gotten to a relationship,\n\n1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:04.740\n but you haven't always,\n\n1:18:04.740 --> 1:18:08.980\n you have not felt the need to be in the relationship\n\n1:18:08.980 --> 1:18:10.620\n just because you're supposed to\n\n1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:13.780\n by society's kind of momentum.\n\n1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:16.900\n If you, I think that if you really want anything,\n\n1:18:16.900 --> 1:18:20.700\n you've got to be prepared fully to be the exact opposite.\n\n1:18:20.700 --> 1:18:22.860\n If you're a person who's looking for a relationship,\n\n1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:24.700\n the only way you're going to get in an awesome relationship\n\n1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:26.740\n is by being comfortable being alone,\n\n1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:27.940\n because that's the risk.\n\n1:18:27.940 --> 1:18:29.380\n If you're a person who's driven by money,\n\n1:18:29.380 --> 1:18:31.460\n you've got to be comfortable being totally poor\n\n1:18:31.460 --> 1:18:33.540\n because that's the risk, right?\n\n1:18:33.540 --> 1:18:37.180\n And when you're constantly hedging your bets,\n\n1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:38.740\n you're never all in.\n\n1:18:38.740 --> 1:18:41.340\n You're never all in on the thing you're trying to do.\n\n1:18:41.340 --> 1:18:45.500\n So a relationship has to compliment your life.\n\n1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:50.460\n You can't say, it's okay to want to be in a relationship,\n\n1:18:50.460 --> 1:18:53.660\n but you can't want to be in a relationship so bad\n\n1:18:53.660 --> 1:18:56.300\n that you take someone in who fits the suit.\n\n1:18:56.300 --> 1:18:58.540\n And it's like, oh, our schedules kind of work out.\n\n1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:00.620\n You live near me and this and that and the other thing,\n\n1:19:00.620 --> 1:19:02.660\n because the logistics of a relationship\n\n1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:04.140\n are not always perfect.\n\n1:19:04.140 --> 1:19:07.020\n It's what matters is when the two people are together.\n\n1:19:07.020 --> 1:19:08.660\n That's the perfect part of it.\n\n1:19:08.660 --> 1:19:13.660\n And it's great to want to meet people and say,\n\n1:19:14.260 --> 1:19:18.900\n if we meet and some sort of a relationship develops,\n\n1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:20.500\n I'm willing to run with it,\n\n1:19:20.500 --> 1:19:23.580\n but I'm not meeting you hoping a relationship develops.\n\n1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:25.460\n I think you kind of put the cart before the horse\n\n1:19:25.460 --> 1:19:27.220\n in a lot of those situations.\n\n1:19:27.220 --> 1:19:28.900\n It's like when guys meet.\n\n1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:32.420\n No guy goes out and is like, I'm looking for a bro, right?\n\n1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:33.260\n Nobody does that.\n\n1:19:33.260 --> 1:19:35.100\n You go to the gym and you run into a bunch of dudes\n\n1:19:35.100 --> 1:19:36.540\n and the next thing you know, someone's cool\n\n1:19:36.540 --> 1:19:37.900\n and they want to talk about fighting\n\n1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:39.380\n and you're fucking shotgun and beers.\n\n1:19:39.380 --> 1:19:41.740\n And all of a sudden you got a bro and that's how it works.\n\n1:19:41.740 --> 1:19:43.140\n It works the same way with women.\n\n1:19:43.140 --> 1:19:45.140\n What's a shotgun and beers?\n\n1:19:45.140 --> 1:19:45.980\n I'll show you after this.\n\n1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:49.260\n You poke a hole in the bottom and you open the top.\n\n1:19:49.260 --> 1:19:52.660\n Yeah, this is the problem with America.\n\n1:19:52.660 --> 1:19:54.980\n Drink vodka like a man.\n\n1:19:54.980 --> 1:19:57.220\n Okay, now don't poke holes in beers.\n\n1:19:57.220 --> 1:19:59.380\n This is the problem with the frat culture.\n\n1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:00.580\n They don't really know how to drink.\n\n1:20:00.580 --> 1:20:01.620\n They think they know how to drink.\n\n1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:02.940\n They don't know how to drink.\n\n1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:07.900\n What do you think makes a successful relationship\n\n1:20:07.900 --> 1:20:09.740\n if we can linger on that a little longer?\n\n1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:14.740\n Like, let me ask John Clark about love.\n\n1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:20.140\n I didn't ask a question, but let me just say love.\n\n1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:23.460\n About love.\n\n1:20:26.660 --> 1:20:31.660\n Are you one of those people who never says I love you?\n\n1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:34.580\n No, no, I'm an extreme person.\n\n1:20:34.580 --> 1:20:37.700\n And like my emotions are also extreme.\n\n1:20:37.700 --> 1:20:42.060\n And one of the things I concern myself with,\n\n1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:45.980\n maybe this is philosophical and martial arts warrior\n\n1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:50.300\n soldier type related stuff is like, I don't want anyone.\n\n1:20:50.300 --> 1:20:52.380\n If I die tonight on the drive home,\n\n1:20:52.380 --> 1:20:54.140\n hopefully that doesn't happen.\n\n1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:56.300\n I hope that no one is left questioning\n\n1:20:56.300 --> 1:20:57.460\n how I felt about them.\n\n1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:02.460\n And people I don't like probably are not questioning that.\n\n1:21:02.780 --> 1:21:04.860\n And so the thing that I've had to learn\n\n1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:06.660\n how to do later in life is to tell the people\n\n1:21:06.660 --> 1:21:10.100\n that you care about, that you care about them.\n\n1:21:10.100 --> 1:21:14.820\n And each thing can be equally off putting\n\n1:21:14.820 --> 1:21:16.460\n to the receiver of the message.\n\n1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:20.060\n Each thing can be equally off putting\n\n1:21:20.060 --> 1:21:20.900\n to the receiver of the message.\n\n1:21:20.900 --> 1:21:22.700\n When you're letting someone know how much you dislike them,\n\n1:21:22.700 --> 1:21:24.100\n that can be off putting to the person\n\n1:21:24.100 --> 1:21:25.260\n receiving that message.\n\n1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:27.100\n And when you tell someone how much you care about them,\n\n1:21:27.100 --> 1:21:29.860\n it can also be off putting to the person,\n\n1:21:29.860 --> 1:21:32.620\n depending on how they view their relationship with you.\n\n1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:34.580\n But it's still important to get it out there.\n\n1:21:34.580 --> 1:21:37.180\n Like you shouldn't hold those things in\n\n1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:39.220\n because you're worried about how they'll be received\n\n1:21:39.220 --> 1:21:41.540\n or if they'll come back at you.\n\n1:21:41.540 --> 1:21:45.460\n So you're okay going all in on these?\n\n1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:46.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:47.700\n Not afraid of commitment?\n\n1:21:47.700 --> 1:21:48.860\n No, I'm not afraid of commitment.\n\n1:21:48.860 --> 1:21:50.140\n Anyone who says they're afraid of commitment\n\n1:21:50.140 --> 1:21:50.980\n is full of shit.\n\n1:21:50.980 --> 1:21:51.820\n You know what they're afraid of?\n\n1:21:51.820 --> 1:21:54.660\n They're afraid of commitment with that person.\n\n1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:56.020\n That's what they're afraid of.\n\n1:21:56.020 --> 1:22:00.220\n Like when someone knocks you on your ass\n\n1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:01.820\n and they come into your life\n\n1:22:01.820 --> 1:22:04.540\n and you're flush with all these emotions,\n\n1:22:04.540 --> 1:22:05.900\n you're not worried about,\n\n1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:07.420\n oh, I don't really like commitment.\n\n1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:08.900\n No, because they've knocked you on your ass.\n\n1:22:08.900 --> 1:22:10.020\n You want to be with them.\n\n1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:11.580\n You want those things.\n\n1:22:11.580 --> 1:22:13.820\n The two most alive points in your life,\n\n1:22:13.820 --> 1:22:16.700\n I think people feel is the euphoria of a new relationship\n\n1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.900\n and then the loss when that love is gone.\n\n1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:23.620\n You'll never feel more, I don't think,\n\n1:22:23.620 --> 1:22:26.060\n than in those moments in your life.\n\n1:22:26.060 --> 1:22:29.900\n See, the nice thing about the loss is it lasts longer.\n\n1:22:31.340 --> 1:22:32.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:36.020\n That's a Louis C.K. point that he makes,\n\n1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:39.700\n which is like that,\n\n1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:41.740\n like in his show, I think,\n\n1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:44.460\n is a conversation with an older gentleman\n\n1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:45.980\n that says like that's his favorite part\n\n1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:48.340\n of the relationship is that period\n\n1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:51.900\n between the loss of the relationship\n\n1:22:51.900 --> 1:22:56.220\n and the real death, which is forgetting the person.\n\n1:22:56.220 --> 1:22:58.060\n But that period lasts the longest\n\n1:22:58.060 --> 1:22:59.940\n and that's like the most fulfilling,\n\n1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:02.900\n like missing the other person\n\n1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:07.060\n is as fulfilling as the actual love,\n\n1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:09.740\n the early infatuation, which is interesting.\n\n1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:11.740\n I also think of the Bukowski.\n\n1:23:11.740 --> 1:23:13.580\n I return to that.\n\n1:23:13.580 --> 1:23:16.620\n There's a little clip of him in an interview\n\n1:23:16.620 --> 1:23:21.220\n saying that love is a fog\n\n1:23:21.220 --> 1:23:25.820\n that dissipates with the first light of reality\n\n1:23:25.820 --> 1:23:26.660\n or something like that.\n\n1:23:26.660 --> 1:23:28.220\n So basically emphasizing\n\n1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:31.260\n that it's this very, very, very fleeting thing,\n\n1:23:31.260 --> 1:23:36.260\n that it's a moments thing and then it just fades\n\n1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:38.980\n and everything else is something else.\n\n1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:41.780\n So love is only a temporary thing, which is interesting.\n\n1:23:41.780 --> 1:23:44.820\n I think some people say that's cynical.\n\n1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:45.660\n I don't know.\n\n1:23:45.660 --> 1:23:46.500\n I don't know what to think of it.\n\n1:23:46.500 --> 1:23:49.220\n I think it's important to understand\n\n1:23:49.220 --> 1:23:51.340\n that everything is fleeting\n\n1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:53.220\n when you don't put effort into it.\n\n1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:55.740\n Almost everything will be fleeting.\n\n1:23:55.740 --> 1:23:56.740\n If you don't put effort into it,\n\n1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:58.060\n most people will get fat and lazy.\n\n1:23:58.060 --> 1:23:59.340\n If you don't put effort into something,\n\n1:23:59.340 --> 1:24:03.980\n you're gonna not be good at playing guitar or playing bass.\n\n1:24:03.980 --> 1:24:04.940\n You've got to put effort into it.\n\n1:24:04.940 --> 1:24:07.380\n The same thing goes for a relationship.\n\n1:24:07.380 --> 1:24:12.100\n That the awesome part of it, that like love part,\n\n1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:15.700\n that dies soon and early on in a relationship\n\n1:24:15.700 --> 1:24:17.700\n because it's so good\n\n1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:20.180\n that we think we don't have to work at it, but you do.\n\n1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:21.780\n You have to keep doing the things\n\n1:24:21.780 --> 1:24:24.500\n and you gotta keep things new and crisp and fresh.\n\n1:24:24.500 --> 1:24:29.500\n And different people probably feel differently about this,\n\n1:24:30.460 --> 1:24:33.700\n but I don't know, you walk around your girl\n\n1:24:33.700 --> 1:24:35.220\n and you start like farting and stuff,\n\n1:24:35.220 --> 1:24:37.260\n like that's when it all dies.\n\n1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:39.100\n That's when it dies.\n\n1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:40.340\n We're all human beings.\n\n1:24:40.340 --> 1:24:44.340\n We're all here and our bodies work in the same way,\n\n1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:48.140\n but you start to chip away at this beautiful thing\n\n1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:53.140\n when you buck conventional courtesy and things like that.\n\n1:24:56.660 --> 1:24:58.060\n Well, take it for granted, basically.\n\n1:24:58.060 --> 1:24:59.140\n You take it for granted, yeah.\n\n1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:00.980\n I mean, that's the same thing with life.\n\n1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:06.260\n I'm a big fan of meditating on death\n\n1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:08.060\n that you could die today.\n\n1:25:08.060 --> 1:25:09.620\n In the same way you should meditate\n\n1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:11.980\n on this relationship could end today,\n\n1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:13.540\n this connection with another human could be.\n\n1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:17.300\n This is the last time you could be interacting.\n\n1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.140\n And your chances of that increase\n\n1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:21.420\n when you take it for granted and you shit on people.\n\n1:25:21.420 --> 1:25:24.500\n But when you work at it, the chances of that decrease.\n\n1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:27.020\n It's never gonna be zero, but it decreases.\n\n1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:30.100\n And when you do that, when you're the person\n\n1:25:30.100 --> 1:25:32.140\n and you're trying to maintain\n\n1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:35.020\n and you're trying to work at the relationship,\n\n1:25:35.020 --> 1:25:37.580\n you gotta make sure that both people are working at it.\n\n1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:39.700\n Otherwise, you're just a fucking chump.\n\n1:25:39.700 --> 1:25:43.420\n Okay, let's return back to mixed martial arts.\n\n1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:44.940\n Let me ask the ridiculous question\n\n1:25:44.940 --> 1:25:47.780\n of who do you think are the top three,\n\n1:25:47.780 --> 1:25:50.540\n maybe top five greatest fighters of all time?\n\n1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:56.740\n It's so hard to compare fighters across generations.\n\n1:25:57.220 --> 1:26:00.100\n And maybe one way to say it is which metrics\n\n1:26:00.100 --> 1:26:01.420\n would you put on the table\n\n1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:03.420\n as to measure what a great fighter is?\n\n1:26:05.860 --> 1:26:08.260\n There was a guy named Dioxapus.\n\n1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:13.260\n And in the fourth century, and he was such a badass\n\n1:26:16.260 --> 1:26:18.820\n that in the Olympics in 336 BC,\n\n1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:22.060\n no one even showed up to fight him in the Pancration event.\n\n1:26:22.060 --> 1:26:24.620\n Nobody even showed up because he was fucking everybody up.\n\n1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:26.460\n Years later, he was retired.\n\n1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:29.460\n And this crazy Macedonian dude came there\n\n1:26:29.460 --> 1:26:32.220\n at some dinner for Alexander the Great,\n\n1:26:32.220 --> 1:26:33.820\n everyone's chilling, drinking,\n\n1:26:33.820 --> 1:26:36.500\n whatever they were drinking out of their chalices.\n\n1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:40.740\n And this Macedonian dude threatened him and challenged him.\n\n1:26:40.740 --> 1:26:43.740\n So Dioxapus said, yeah, man, we'll throw down.\n\n1:26:43.740 --> 1:26:45.780\n And they set the time and the place.\n\n1:26:45.780 --> 1:26:49.460\n Macedonian dude comes out like body armor,\n\n1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:52.420\n spear, shield, all this other shit.\n\n1:26:52.420 --> 1:26:56.420\n Dioxapus came out absolutely naked with a wooden club\n\n1:26:56.420 --> 1:26:58.500\n and took on this much younger guy,\n\n1:26:58.500 --> 1:26:59.740\n beat the living crap out of him\n\n1:26:59.740 --> 1:27:01.540\n and then put his foot on his throat\n\n1:27:01.540 --> 1:27:06.540\n and then didn't even kill him in the show of ultimate power\n\n1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:08.380\n for the time.\n\n1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:09.220\n So I think.\n\n1:27:09.220 --> 1:27:11.300\n There's something about the guy being naked too\n\n1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:13.020\n is just extra demeaning.\n\n1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:14.740\n Extra demeaning, yeah.\n\n1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:18.580\n Okay, can we rephrase the question then?\n\n1:27:18.580 --> 1:27:21.020\n Because those are clearly going to be\n\n1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:23.940\n some probably forgotten warriors in history.\n\n1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:26.540\n Well, let's take it to like modern day mixed martial arts\n\n1:27:26.540 --> 1:27:27.660\n in the UFC, perhaps.\n\n1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:30.380\n Well, just mixed martial arts there.\n\n1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:32.180\n Who do you think are the top fighters of all time?\n\n1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:34.180\n What metrics would you consider\n\n1:27:34.180 --> 1:27:38.260\n in trying to answer this perhaps unanswerable question?\n\n1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:40.060\n I think one of the things you want to think about\n\n1:27:40.060 --> 1:27:44.140\n is strength of opponent at the time you fought them.\n\n1:27:44.140 --> 1:27:48.220\n So for example, fighting BJ Penn in his prime\n\n1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:50.340\n and beating him is far different\n\n1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:52.740\n than beating BJ Penn last year, right?\n\n1:27:52.740 --> 1:27:54.780\n So to say you have a victory over BJ Penn\n\n1:27:54.780 --> 1:27:59.020\n is not the same given the timeframe of when it happened.\n\n1:27:59.020 --> 1:28:01.980\n Not to take anything away from anyone who's beaten BJ Penn.\n\n1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:05.300\n Just use that as an example of someone whose career\n\n1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:07.780\n went into a different direction.\n\n1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:12.780\n I would say the guy who I think is probably the best\n\n1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:17.300\n that people are the least familiar with\n\n1:28:17.300 --> 1:28:19.660\n would be Marillo Bustamante.\n\n1:28:19.660 --> 1:28:23.260\n And I think he was a guy who was one of the guys\n\n1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:26.740\n with the first really good physical build for MMA,\n\n1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:29.860\n which I think is narrow from the chest to the back\n\n1:28:29.860 --> 1:28:32.260\n and long shoulder to shoulder\n\n1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:34.900\n and kind of sinewy made out of steel cable.\n\n1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:36.700\n That was a guy who could box,\n\n1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:37.980\n that was a guy who could wrestle,\n\n1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:39.900\n and that was a guy who had great jujitsu.\n\n1:28:39.900 --> 1:28:41.700\n He wasn't a great kickboxer,\n\n1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.140\n but at the time he didn't need it.\n\n1:28:43.140 --> 1:28:46.700\n Fought everybody and gave everybody a run.\n\n1:28:46.700 --> 1:28:50.020\n I think he's probably one of those guys\n\n1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:52.740\n who's gotta be considered.\n\n1:28:52.740 --> 1:28:55.140\n Yeah, there's a few killers that never,\n\n1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:57.940\n because why is he not in the discussion?\n\n1:28:57.940 --> 1:29:02.940\n Because I think greatness requires both the skill\n\n1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:06.780\n and the opportunity to meet each other.\n\n1:29:06.780 --> 1:29:08.020\n And when you talk about a fighter,\n\n1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:10.620\n the other thing that really a good fighter needs\n\n1:29:10.620 --> 1:29:12.020\n to become great is a foil.\n\n1:29:12.900 --> 1:29:15.540\n And so many fighters don't have a foil.\n\n1:29:15.540 --> 1:29:17.460\n That's one of the biggest detractions, I think,\n\n1:29:17.460 --> 1:29:19.220\n of early Mike Tyson's career.\n\n1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:20.460\n He didn't have a foil.\n\n1:29:20.460 --> 1:29:22.020\n He had no one driving him.\n\n1:29:22.020 --> 1:29:23.100\n And by the time he did,\n\n1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:25.140\n by the time he had a foil in Holyfield,\n\n1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:26.740\n his career was in a different place.\n\n1:29:26.740 --> 1:29:28.620\n But he's one of the greats of all time,\n\n1:29:28.620 --> 1:29:30.100\n and he never really had a foil,\n\n1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:35.100\n so his greatness was in unparalleled destruction\n\n1:29:35.980 --> 1:29:40.980\n of like nobody as well, of lesser opponents.\n\n1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:45.260\n Right, and so when people debate\n\n1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:48.020\n the level of greatness of Mike Tyson,\n\n1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:49.060\n that's one of the things they say,\n\n1:29:49.060 --> 1:29:51.940\n like he didn't fight a lot of killers in their prime.\n\n1:29:51.940 --> 1:29:55.940\n I think you've obviously got to say in that conversation,\n\n1:29:55.940 --> 1:29:58.380\n I have a really difficult time\n\n1:29:58.380 --> 1:30:01.020\n keeping George St. Pierre out of the conversation,\n\n1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:06.380\n only because he was able to beat you with anything.\n\n1:30:06.380 --> 1:30:09.740\n He could out jab you, he could out wrestle you,\n\n1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:11.940\n and he could submit you.\n\n1:30:11.940 --> 1:30:13.540\n The problem I have with Fedor\n\n1:30:13.540 --> 1:30:18.540\n is his career also took a drastic turn towards the end.\n\n1:30:18.540 --> 1:30:21.020\n And when he was fighting in Pride,\n\n1:30:21.020 --> 1:30:22.660\n he was doing a lot more grappling,\n\n1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:24.060\n and then he just started casting\n\n1:30:24.060 --> 1:30:25.660\n that overhand right at people.\n\n1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:29.540\n And his game kind of changed at that point.\n\n1:30:29.540 --> 1:30:31.020\n You can't take anything away from his greatness,\n\n1:30:31.020 --> 1:30:34.980\n but at that time, the great heavyweights\n\n1:30:34.980 --> 1:30:37.540\n were not really fighting in Pride,\n\n1:30:37.540 --> 1:30:38.700\n and they didn't really exist yet.\n\n1:30:38.700 --> 1:30:40.140\n And by the time he fought a really good one,\n\n1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:42.860\n Fabricio Verdun, he did get submitted there.\n\n1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:47.860\n Does his later performance color your and our perception\n\n1:30:47.860 --> 1:30:51.700\n of his greatness in general about fighters?\n\n1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:55.220\n Not mine, but I'm someone who's intimately involved\n\n1:30:55.220 --> 1:30:57.660\n in the sport, but it colors everyone else's.\n\n1:30:57.660 --> 1:30:58.940\n Same with Anderson Silva.\n\n1:30:58.940 --> 1:31:00.460\n I don't think Anderson Silva doesn't want to fight\n\n1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.020\n in like seven years or something, or he's like one.\n\n1:31:03.020 --> 1:31:06.900\n That's a guy who in his prime was one of the best fighters.\n\n1:31:06.900 --> 1:31:08.500\n Is he in the top five for you?\n\n1:31:08.500 --> 1:31:10.020\n I think he's probably in the top five, yeah.\n\n1:31:10.020 --> 1:31:11.940\n Greater striker of all time or no?\n\n1:31:11.940 --> 1:31:12.780\n In MMA?\n\n1:31:12.780 --> 1:31:13.900\n In mixed martial arts.\n\n1:31:13.900 --> 1:31:15.020\n In mixed martial arts?\n\n1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:19.620\n In mixed martial arts, that's a tough question.\n\n1:31:19.620 --> 1:31:22.300\n The greatest MMA striker of all time.\n\n1:31:22.300 --> 1:31:23.860\n Because like the timing,\n\n1:31:25.340 --> 1:31:27.620\n we're talking about foot sweeps, right?\n\n1:31:27.620 --> 1:31:31.420\n Who makes it look easier than Anderson Silva?\n\n1:31:31.420 --> 1:31:36.420\n I think in an incredibly short sample of his prime,\n\n1:31:36.660 --> 1:31:37.940\n it's gotta be Anderson Silva,\n\n1:31:37.940 --> 1:31:41.860\n and I think you have to consider discussing Leota Machida\n\n1:31:41.860 --> 1:31:45.540\n for his unbelievable manipulation of distance,\n\n1:31:45.540 --> 1:31:47.660\n which is something that people don't really talk too much\n\n1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:48.940\n about in terms of fighting,\n\n1:31:48.940 --> 1:31:50.940\n unless you're someone in the sport.\n\n1:31:50.940 --> 1:31:54.340\n That his use of distance and the ability to like,\n\n1:31:54.340 --> 1:31:57.820\n what we call pop out, like make you miss by one inch\n\n1:31:57.820 --> 1:31:59.940\n so that he could follow your fist back in\n\n1:31:59.940 --> 1:32:02.900\n as you retract it and it hit you over the top,\n\n1:32:02.900 --> 1:32:06.180\n that that's a thing of beauty.\n\n1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:08.540\n Anderson Silva, when he became a counter striker,\n\n1:32:08.540 --> 1:32:10.220\n when he got to his prime in the UFC,\n\n1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:11.820\n that was a thing of beauty.\n\n1:32:11.820 --> 1:32:13.540\n That was a thing of beauty.\n\n1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:15.060\n So I think definitely those two guys\n\n1:32:15.060 --> 1:32:18.540\n and Murilo Bustamante's gotta be the third guy.\n\n1:32:18.540 --> 1:32:20.140\n There's just so many good guys now.\n\n1:32:20.140 --> 1:32:20.980\n It's just.\n\n1:32:20.980 --> 1:32:23.100\n So where do you put, in terms of metrics,\n\n1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:24.940\n you mentioned GSP and Anderson Silva,\n\n1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:27.780\n I think they have a large number of defenses of a title.\n\n1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:30.140\n Is that important to you?\n\n1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:32.780\n Like this kind of consistent domination?\n\n1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:36.180\n No, because it's easily manipulated\n\n1:32:36.180 --> 1:32:38.340\n by the people making money off the fights.\n\n1:32:38.340 --> 1:32:40.660\n So there was a great quote one time\n\n1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:42.460\n when the UFC was coming to prominence\n\n1:32:42.460 --> 1:32:46.620\n and Vince McMahon from the WWE, he said,\n\n1:32:46.620 --> 1:32:48.260\n you know, the difference between what we do\n\n1:32:48.260 --> 1:32:53.260\n and what UFC does is that when we have a superstar,\n\n1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:55.460\n I can make sure he stays on top\n\n1:32:55.460 --> 1:32:56.700\n until he's no longer a superstar\n\n1:32:56.700 --> 1:32:58.900\n because we have predetermined results.\n\n1:32:58.900 --> 1:33:01.500\n UFC can't do that because they're actually having fights.\n\n1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:02.860\n Well, it's true and false.\n\n1:33:02.860 --> 1:33:03.700\n You can't do that,\n\n1:33:03.700 --> 1:33:07.580\n but you can give your superstars the most favorable matchups\n\n1:33:07.580 --> 1:33:09.540\n to keep them on top for the longest.\n\n1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:11.500\n So people always talk about title defenses\n\n1:33:11.500 --> 1:33:13.980\n as if the guy they're fighting, the challenger,\n\n1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:16.620\n is always the person most deserving of the shot.\n\n1:33:16.620 --> 1:33:17.460\n And it's just not true.\n\n1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:19.660\n So I don't put that much stock in it.\n\n1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:23.700\n Is it possible to put a guy in consideration\n\n1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:25.540\n as one of the greats\n\n1:33:25.540 --> 1:33:29.460\n if all they had is one or two amazing fights?\n\n1:33:30.940 --> 1:33:33.900\n I'll tell you, like an amazing\n\n1:33:33.900 --> 1:33:35.740\n could be a lot of different definitions.\n\n1:33:35.740 --> 1:33:37.340\n It could be just the war.\n\n1:33:37.340 --> 1:33:39.060\n Like they never really reached\n\n1:33:39.060 --> 1:33:41.460\n the highest of excellences of domination,\n\n1:33:41.460 --> 1:33:44.140\n but they've, like this,\n\n1:33:44.140 --> 1:33:47.180\n we had this discussion about Kyle Bokniak, right?\n\n1:33:47.180 --> 1:33:48.020\n Yep.\n\n1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:50.460\n To me, that's a perfect example.\n\n1:33:50.460 --> 1:33:55.460\n He had this famous fight against Zabit Magomed Sharapov,\n\n1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:03.620\n where on one side you have an Anderson Silva type of fighter\n\n1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:07.460\n and Zabit, like just a very good striker.\n\n1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:12.460\n Like, and then there's like the warrior on the Kyle side.\n\n1:34:13.740 --> 1:34:14.660\n And just the fight,\n\n1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:16.380\n they created something special together.\n\n1:34:16.380 --> 1:34:17.620\n It was fight at night, whatever.\n\n1:34:17.620 --> 1:34:22.620\n But the, you know, that fight was special on that night\n\n1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:25.860\n because the two dance partners.\n\n1:34:25.860 --> 1:34:27.700\n You can have a great performance\n\n1:34:27.700 --> 1:34:28.900\n without being a great fighter.\n\n1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:30.660\n Not saying neither of those guys is a great fighter,\n\n1:34:30.660 --> 1:34:32.340\n but to answer your first question,\n\n1:34:32.340 --> 1:34:36.220\n I think that having one or two great performances\n\n1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:38.380\n does not necessarily mean that you are great.\n\n1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:39.860\n I need a larger sample size.\n\n1:34:39.860 --> 1:34:41.740\n I have no idea what that is.\n\n1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:42.820\n I don't have any idea what that is.\n\n1:34:42.820 --> 1:34:43.660\n And also,\n\n1:34:48.540 --> 1:34:52.220\n where, how much weight does toughness have\n\n1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:53.940\n when you're thinking about the criteria\n\n1:34:53.940 --> 1:34:56.380\n when you define a great fighter?\n\n1:34:56.380 --> 1:34:58.980\n That's a good question.\n\n1:34:58.980 --> 1:35:00.740\n And I don't have the answer to it.\n\n1:35:00.740 --> 1:35:03.220\n I admire the underdog that rises to the occasion\n\n1:35:03.220 --> 1:35:04.420\n through brute force.\n\n1:35:04.420 --> 1:35:05.260\n They didn't have,\n\n1:35:05.260 --> 1:35:07.100\n they didn't bring the skillset to the table\n\n1:35:07.100 --> 1:35:09.580\n that perhaps some of the greats have,\n\n1:35:09.580 --> 1:35:12.260\n but they rose to the occasion.\n\n1:35:12.260 --> 1:35:13.740\n I mean, there's something about that.\n\n1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:14.580\n There's something about that.\n\n1:35:14.580 --> 1:35:17.500\n And so now we're more talking about like\n\n1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:18.900\n the internal attributes\n\n1:35:18.900 --> 1:35:21.260\n as opposed to the external physical attributes.\n\n1:35:21.260 --> 1:35:25.300\n And those are the things I think that you cannot teach.\n\n1:35:25.300 --> 1:35:27.620\n Those things, you come in the door\n\n1:35:27.620 --> 1:35:28.820\n and you either have that or you don't.\n\n1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:30.940\n I think, and we talk about this all the time,\n\n1:35:30.940 --> 1:35:31.900\n and this is one of the things\n\n1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:34.180\n where my mind changes regularly.\n\n1:35:34.180 --> 1:35:35.460\n Like on what makes a fighter,\n\n1:35:35.460 --> 1:35:37.780\n is it born or is it bred?\n\n1:35:37.780 --> 1:35:42.740\n And this week I'm of the opinion that it's in you.\n\n1:35:42.740 --> 1:35:44.500\n And maybe it's in you and you suppress it\n\n1:35:44.500 --> 1:35:46.140\n and people can tease it out of you,\n\n1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:48.060\n but I don't think you can make someone\n\n1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:49.980\n who doesn't have that seed in there.\n\n1:35:49.980 --> 1:35:53.020\n I don't think you can turn them into that great warrior\n\n1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:56.300\n with that level of grit and mental toughness.\n\n1:35:56.300 --> 1:36:00.060\n Now, when that fight, when Kyle fights Zabit,\n\n1:36:00.060 --> 1:36:02.180\n it's a unique situation for both guys.\n\n1:36:02.180 --> 1:36:06.300\n It was kind of a later replacement fight for Kyle.\n\n1:36:06.300 --> 1:36:08.220\n Zabit's star was on the rise.\n\n1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:11.100\n And Kyle put the blueprint out there on how to beat Zabit.\n\n1:36:12.420 --> 1:36:13.460\n Which is?\n\n1:36:13.460 --> 1:36:14.740\n Which is pressure him\n\n1:36:14.740 --> 1:36:16.140\n and try and drag him into the late rounds.\n\n1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:19.540\n You notice that later on when Calvin Kader fought him,\n\n1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:21.740\n they wouldn't give him five rounds.\n\n1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:22.820\n They wanted five rounds.\n\n1:36:22.820 --> 1:36:24.380\n And Zabit's camp, from what I understand,\n\n1:36:24.380 --> 1:36:26.300\n would not agree to the five round fight.\n\n1:36:26.300 --> 1:36:28.060\n Well, he didn't look.\n\n1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:30.580\n Right, so with Kyle, it was a three round fight.\n\n1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:31.420\n Three round fight.\n\n1:36:31.420 --> 1:36:33.900\n And did it went to decision?\n\n1:36:33.900 --> 1:36:34.740\n It went to decision.\n\n1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:36.660\n Well, Zabit won the decision, clearly.\n\n1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:39.380\n Did Kyle have a shot at winning the third round?\n\n1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:40.660\n I don't remember the exact score,\n\n1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:43.100\n but Kyle could have won the third round\n\n1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:46.260\n had he done a couple things differently.\n\n1:36:46.260 --> 1:36:48.500\n But I do believe in the fourth round,\n\n1:36:48.500 --> 1:36:50.020\n I think Kyle wouldn't have won a fourth round.\n\n1:36:50.020 --> 1:36:52.060\n And I think maybe even won the fight\n\n1:36:52.060 --> 1:36:53.500\n if there would have been a fifth round.\n\n1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:55.260\n And he was pressing forward,\n\n1:36:56.980 --> 1:37:00.460\n perhaps in a funny way that you could tell me I'm wrong,\n\n1:37:00.460 --> 1:37:04.100\n but it felt like he wasn't emphasizing head movement\n\n1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:04.940\n at that point.\n\n1:37:04.940 --> 1:37:05.900\n He went full Mike Tyson.\n\n1:37:05.900 --> 1:37:07.620\n There was a point at which,\n\n1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.180\n so it's funny that you say that.\n\n1:37:09.180 --> 1:37:11.300\n Which is a contradiction, actually, because.\n\n1:37:11.300 --> 1:37:12.940\n Mike Tyson had great head movement.\n\n1:37:12.940 --> 1:37:15.100\n I actually don't know exactly what I mean\n\n1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:17.780\n because he was in the pocket.\n\n1:37:17.780 --> 1:37:19.140\n I think he was trying to do the movement.\n\n1:37:19.140 --> 1:37:21.260\n He was just in the pocket and pressing forward.\n\n1:37:21.260 --> 1:37:23.860\n And the fuck you attitude of just not pressing down.\n\n1:37:23.860 --> 1:37:24.700\n That was a little bit later\n\n1:37:24.700 --> 1:37:26.620\n when Zabit's back was towards the cage.\n\n1:37:26.620 --> 1:37:28.460\n Towards the end of the round.\n\n1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:30.540\n We get that fight.\n\n1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:32.500\n And I said to Kyle, I was like,\n\n1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:34.580\n look, this kid has been training martial arts\n\n1:37:34.580 --> 1:37:36.180\n since he was three years old.\n\n1:37:36.180 --> 1:37:39.100\n There's not an area where you're gonna out technique him.\n\n1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:41.380\n And so we've gotta now channel some of that grit\n\n1:37:41.380 --> 1:37:42.380\n that we know you have.\n\n1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.460\n This is an opportunity to showcase it.\n\n1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:46.340\n And I don't know how long I did it for,\n\n1:37:47.300 --> 1:37:49.300\n because Kyle's much shorter than Zabit.\n\n1:37:49.300 --> 1:37:50.780\n So for a good long while,\n\n1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:51.980\n while we were training for Zabit,\n\n1:37:51.980 --> 1:37:53.340\n I didn't even say anything.\n\n1:37:53.340 --> 1:37:55.740\n And I just had clips of Mike Tyson training\n\n1:37:55.740 --> 1:37:58.220\n on the TV in the gym and the head movement.\n\n1:37:58.220 --> 1:37:59.500\n And I didn't even mention it.\n\n1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:01.620\n And then we started to like get into it\n\n1:38:01.620 --> 1:38:03.900\n and talk about getting inside the length\n\n1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:06.540\n of the longer fighter and things like that.\n\n1:38:06.540 --> 1:38:09.740\n And we kind of, which when some people train MMA,\n\n1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:12.780\n they say, okay, this guy's a really good wrestler.\n\n1:38:12.780 --> 1:38:15.460\n Let's think about avoiding the wrestling\n\n1:38:15.460 --> 1:38:16.940\n or being a better wrestler.\n\n1:38:16.940 --> 1:38:21.220\n And I think that when the difference in skill is so great,\n\n1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:22.820\n those are both the wrong answer.\n\n1:38:24.020 --> 1:38:26.220\n If a guy who's a really good wrestler wants to take you down\n\n1:38:26.220 --> 1:38:27.540\n and you don't have a lot of wrestling experience,\n\n1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:28.700\n he's probably gonna get you down\n\n1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:30.580\n if he's got a good coach, right?\n\n1:38:30.580 --> 1:38:32.620\n So you have to deal with that.\n\n1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:35.500\n To then say, I'm gonna then learn in eight weeks\n\n1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:37.220\n how to wrestle better than a guy who's been wrestling\n\n1:38:37.220 --> 1:38:39.500\n since he was eight years old is also a bad idea.\n\n1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:41.340\n So what we concentrated on for that camp\n\n1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:43.380\n and it worked beautifully was\n\n1:38:43.380 --> 1:38:45.900\n not getting caught in chain wrestling.\n\n1:38:45.900 --> 1:38:48.060\n These are the takedowns you're gonna get caught with.\n\n1:38:48.060 --> 1:38:50.460\n This is how to not get caught with the next step\n\n1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:52.620\n while you're defending takedown one.\n\n1:38:52.620 --> 1:38:54.140\n Cause it's the chain of techniques\n\n1:38:54.140 --> 1:38:56.100\n that are gonna get fucked, right?\n\n1:38:56.100 --> 1:38:58.820\n So we talked, we did a ton of work on get ups\n\n1:38:58.820 --> 1:39:01.220\n and breaking the hands from the various takedowns.\n\n1:39:01.220 --> 1:39:02.460\n Like it was a while ago now.\n\n1:39:02.460 --> 1:39:05.260\n So I don't remember exactly the techniques we worked on,\n\n1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:08.580\n but we concentrated on defend the first takedown\n\n1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:10.220\n and stay out of the chain.\n\n1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:12.700\n Don't get chained into a bunch of wrestling techniques\n\n1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:14.980\n cause you will be out wrestled.\n\n1:39:14.980 --> 1:39:16.060\n And that was really successful.\n\n1:39:16.060 --> 1:39:18.740\n And then in the third round, Zabit was tired.\n\n1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:19.900\n And...\n\n1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:20.740\n He was tired.\n\n1:39:20.740 --> 1:39:21.580\n He's Zabit got tired.\n\n1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:23.500\n He cuts a tremendous amount of weight.\n\n1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:26.300\n Like I can't see him staying at 145 forever\n\n1:39:26.300 --> 1:39:28.100\n when they start giving him five round fights.\n\n1:39:28.100 --> 1:39:29.460\n I don't even know if he's had a five round fight\n\n1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:32.900\n and he may have, but I can't see him staying down there.\n\n1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:35.060\n He's, the guy's like six one.\n\n1:39:35.060 --> 1:39:36.900\n Guys, he's a giant of a guy.\n\n1:39:36.900 --> 1:39:40.980\n So Kyle pressed forward there and he said,\n\n1:39:40.980 --> 1:39:43.220\n he felt that there was no power left in Zabit's hands.\n\n1:39:43.220 --> 1:39:44.820\n And so he felt fine.\n\n1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:47.100\n And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd\n\n1:39:47.100 --> 1:39:50.260\n as he moved forward and, you know,\n\n1:39:50.260 --> 1:39:54.580\n saw that he wasn't taking a lot of damage.\n\n1:39:54.580 --> 1:39:56.220\n Like the punches weren't staying him.\n\n1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:58.580\n He started walking right through him.\n\n1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:01.060\n It goes to your question of what makes a fighter.\n\n1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:05.180\n Was the, him walking forward like that,\n\n1:40:06.220 --> 1:40:07.860\n something that you're born with\n\n1:40:07.860 --> 1:40:09.420\n or is that something you were training?\n\n1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:11.300\n Is that the Mike Tyson on TV?\n\n1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:12.620\n He's born with that.\n\n1:40:12.620 --> 1:40:14.140\n Kyle is born with that.\n\n1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.580\n And the crowd, I've been in a lot.\n\n1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:17.420\n Was he in Boston?\n\n1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:18.260\n No, he was in New York.\n\n1:40:18.260 --> 1:40:19.100\n He was in Brooklyn.\n\n1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:20.260\n I've been in a lot of arenas\n\n1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:21.620\n for a lot of different sporting events.\n\n1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:23.700\n That's one of the loudest things I've ever heard\n\n1:40:23.700 --> 1:40:24.540\n when he did that.\n\n1:40:24.540 --> 1:40:26.060\n I was going crazy.\n\n1:40:26.060 --> 1:40:29.820\n And you ask about that being like taught or not.\n\n1:40:29.820 --> 1:40:31.540\n Kyle is so much like that,\n\n1:40:31.540 --> 1:40:33.740\n that I have to try and tease some of that out of him,\n\n1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:34.980\n pull it back.\n\n1:40:34.980 --> 1:40:39.740\n Because he's also so very technical when he wants to be\n\n1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:42.220\n that the emotion and the fun of it\n\n1:40:42.220 --> 1:40:43.980\n gets in the way of his technique.\n\n1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:47.540\n And probably has cost him a couple of wins.\n\n1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:48.380\n And so that's one of the things\n\n1:40:48.380 --> 1:40:49.300\n we work on with him right now.\n\n1:40:49.300 --> 1:40:52.300\n It's like staying within yourself, being a professional,\n\n1:40:52.300 --> 1:40:54.940\n taking your time to download the information in round one\n\n1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:56.780\n and then starting your fight in round two.\n\n1:40:56.780 --> 1:40:58.420\n But the tension between those two things,\n\n1:40:58.420 --> 1:41:02.740\n what makes, what on that day created one of the,\n\n1:41:02.740 --> 1:41:06.700\n in my opinion, one of the greatest fights I've ever seen.\n\n1:41:06.700 --> 1:41:07.860\n Joe Rogan agrees.\n\n1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:09.140\n Yeah, it's one of the greatest fights\n\n1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:10.580\n I've certainly ever seen.\n\n1:41:10.580 --> 1:41:13.940\n So like, it's funny that you as a coach,\n\n1:41:13.940 --> 1:41:16.860\n I can see the frustration of like,\n\n1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:20.580\n like throwing away some of the strategy kind of thing.\n\n1:41:20.580 --> 1:41:23.180\n Like you seeing like being not happy\n\n1:41:23.180 --> 1:41:24.300\n that there could be things\n\n1:41:24.300 --> 1:41:26.020\n that he could have done to win the fight.\n\n1:41:26.020 --> 1:41:26.900\n It's in retrospect.\n\n1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:28.500\n I think that at that time,\n\n1:41:28.500 --> 1:41:30.740\n we were playing with incredible house money.\n\n1:41:30.740 --> 1:41:33.180\n Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that fight.\n\n1:41:33.180 --> 1:41:34.340\n Zabit was unstoppable.\n\n1:41:34.340 --> 1:41:35.820\n I think people were probably picking him\n\n1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:37.180\n to finish the fight in round one.\n\n1:41:37.180 --> 1:41:38.020\n I think at that point,\n\n1:41:38.020 --> 1:41:40.060\n no one had ever gone the distance with Zabit.\n\n1:41:40.060 --> 1:41:42.100\n And no one certainly had, you know,\n\n1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:43.620\n put that kind of performance together.\n\n1:41:43.620 --> 1:41:47.260\n And I think Kyle put the blueprint out there.\n\n1:41:47.260 --> 1:41:51.340\n And in retrospect, when I look at the last round,\n\n1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:53.500\n yeah, there were things that could have been done differently,\n\n1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:55.140\n but we're playing with house money at that point.\n\n1:41:55.140 --> 1:41:57.340\n Like, I mean, let it fly.\n\n1:41:57.340 --> 1:41:59.060\n You get to a point where you've got it,\n\n1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:01.540\n you're down three rounds and there's 20 seconds left.\n\n1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:03.420\n You got to move all your chips to the center of the table\n\n1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:05.500\n and, you know, see what happens.\n\n1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:07.460\n Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it?\n\n1:42:07.460 --> 1:42:09.620\n I remember like he got won over.\n\n1:42:09.620 --> 1:42:11.900\n I think I have trouble remembering\n\n1:42:11.900 --> 1:42:13.500\n because offline we talked about that fight\n\n1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:15.420\n and he's exceptionally impressed by,\n\n1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:18.740\n I mean, Joe's from Boston, so it's like,\n\n1:42:18.740 --> 1:42:20.820\n I mean, there's a story there.\n\n1:42:20.820 --> 1:42:23.100\n Okay, it sucks not,\n\n1:42:23.100 --> 1:42:25.300\n you naturally want to romanticize,\n\n1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:28.460\n like there's a Rocky versus like,\n\n1:42:28.460 --> 1:42:30.380\n there's a Rocky IV, a Draga.\n\n1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:34.460\n I mean, similar, I suppose, kind of chemistry.\n\n1:42:35.820 --> 1:42:39.540\n Kyle's style represents the American.\n\n1:42:39.540 --> 1:42:40.580\n Ideal, right?\n\n1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:41.420\n The spirit.\n\n1:42:41.420 --> 1:42:42.540\n Yeah, I mean, he's from Gloucester.\n\n1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:45.740\n It's like, you could have dragged him off the docks\n\n1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:47.540\n three hours before the fight and said,\n\n1:42:47.540 --> 1:42:48.420\n hey, you want to go fight?\n\n1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:50.300\n And he would have said yes.\n\n1:42:50.300 --> 1:42:51.940\n Oh man, that was a special fight.\n\n1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.780\n But that's, as per a discussion\n\n1:42:53.780 --> 1:42:55.540\n of like greatest fighters of all time,\n\n1:42:55.540 --> 1:42:59.580\n I tend to believe that that fight is more special\n\n1:42:59.580 --> 1:43:04.460\n than the championship belt defenses by George St. Pierre.\n\n1:43:04.460 --> 1:43:06.340\n Like, you know, there's something to that.\n\n1:43:06.340 --> 1:43:11.340\n It's like Rocky, Rocky I is more special\n\n1:43:12.220 --> 1:43:15.420\n than like Rocky III, right?\n\n1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:19.820\n So like, it's the underdog or it's whatever,\n\n1:43:19.820 --> 1:43:21.940\n like the dance partner is like going to war\n\n1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:24.580\n and like that moment, I mean, it's bigger.\n\n1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:26.980\n It's bigger than any individual fighter.\n\n1:43:26.980 --> 1:43:29.740\n They create that and that,\n\n1:43:29.740 --> 1:43:32.100\n I know it's not perhaps good for a career.\n\n1:43:32.100 --> 1:43:34.300\n It's not good for like in terms of money,\n\n1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:35.220\n in terms of longevity,\n\n1:43:35.220 --> 1:43:36.340\n in terms of all those kinds of things,\n\n1:43:36.340 --> 1:43:39.020\n but that's a special moment in the history of fighting\n\n1:43:39.020 --> 1:43:40.140\n that you both created.\n\n1:43:40.140 --> 1:43:42.560\n I can remember like right after,\n\n1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:45.060\n like there was so much excitement in the air\n\n1:43:45.060 --> 1:43:46.160\n during the third round.\n\n1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:47.460\n And I remember being in the corner\n\n1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:50.660\n and like, I was so excited at the end of it\n\n1:43:50.660 --> 1:43:53.060\n that I had forgotten what happened in the other two rounds.\n\n1:43:53.060 --> 1:43:53.900\n I didn't even know.\n\n1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:56.620\n And I looked to Sean, one of the other corner men,\n\n1:43:56.620 --> 1:43:58.860\n and I think I said to him, did we win?\n\n1:43:58.860 --> 1:44:00.220\n When you rewatch the fight,\n\n1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:01.380\n clearly we didn't win the fight.\n\n1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:02.500\n I mean, we lost the other rounds,\n\n1:44:02.500 --> 1:44:05.020\n but I got so caught up in that moment\n\n1:44:05.020 --> 1:44:07.020\n and I just remember like,\n\n1:44:07.020 --> 1:44:10.360\n I was so in awe of his performance\n\n1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:12.360\n that like I forgot what was going on.\n\n1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:16.060\n And it's so hard to not be a fan at that moment\n\n1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:18.340\n and to stay within yourself and try and like coach,\n\n1:44:18.340 --> 1:44:20.660\n but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point?\n\n1:44:20.660 --> 1:44:21.820\n It's like, we're rumbling.\n\n1:44:21.820 --> 1:44:22.660\n We got 30 seconds.\n\n1:44:22.660 --> 1:44:23.480\n We're trying to win here.\n\n1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:26.580\n And I remember like the performance itself,\n\n1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:28.040\n I'm not a fan of moral victories,\n\n1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:30.140\n but if ever there was gonna be one, that was one.\n\n1:44:30.140 --> 1:44:32.140\n And when the fight was over and I grabbed Kyle,\n\n1:44:32.140 --> 1:44:35.460\n like they hadn't even been to the center of the cage yet.\n\n1:44:35.460 --> 1:44:38.460\n And I just hugged him and I said, you're my fucking hero.\n\n1:44:38.460 --> 1:44:41.420\n And I remember being very emotional about that,\n\n1:44:41.420 --> 1:44:43.260\n that I was able to be a part of that.\n\n1:44:43.260 --> 1:44:45.460\n It feels wrong to say, but I was,\n\n1:44:45.460 --> 1:44:46.860\n I kind of avoided saying it,\n\n1:44:46.860 --> 1:44:49.740\n but I think if I'm being honest with my feelings,\n\n1:44:49.740 --> 1:44:52.380\n this is a safe space for feelings.\n\n1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:57.380\n Is I think it was the greatest mixed martial arts fight\n\n1:44:57.620 --> 1:44:59.180\n I've ever seen.\n\n1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:00.780\n And I don't think I'm being biased.\n\n1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:02.860\n I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased?\n\n1:45:02.860 --> 1:45:05.020\n I honestly don't think so.\n\n1:45:05.020 --> 1:45:06.380\n I think that was the greatest fight.\n\n1:45:06.380 --> 1:45:08.300\n Like if you wanna rank fights I've ever seen,\n\n1:45:08.300 --> 1:45:10.780\n I think to me that was the greatest fight I've ever seen.\n\n1:45:10.780 --> 1:45:13.820\n It certainly was one of the greatest displays\n\n1:45:13.820 --> 1:45:17.900\n of like just dogged effort from an underdog\n\n1:45:17.900 --> 1:45:22.500\n who was out experienced and probably outsized.\n\n1:45:22.500 --> 1:45:25.140\n But I mean, like you just,\n\n1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:26.180\n Kyle's one of those kids,\n\n1:45:26.180 --> 1:45:27.980\n you're never gonna tell him he's out of a fight.\n\n1:45:27.980 --> 1:45:29.900\n He has something you can't teach.\n\n1:45:29.900 --> 1:45:34.900\n And I've seen tons of people with more physical attributes\n\n1:45:35.260 --> 1:45:36.820\n and they're just mental midgets\n\n1:45:36.820 --> 1:45:39.700\n and they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart.\n\n1:45:39.700 --> 1:45:42.220\n And Kyle is not that.\n\n1:45:42.220 --> 1:45:44.340\n And you can't teach it no matter what you do.\n\n1:45:44.340 --> 1:45:49.060\n But that was, I would say like my career in combat sports,\n\n1:45:49.060 --> 1:45:51.260\n which spans, if you wanna go all the way back\n\n1:45:51.260 --> 1:45:53.980\n to like wrestling, like that was one of probably\n\n1:45:53.980 --> 1:45:56.400\n the greatest experiences I've been a part of.\n\n1:45:57.940 --> 1:45:58.940\n It's a bittersweet sport.\n\n1:45:58.940 --> 1:46:00.240\n She's a fickle mistress.\n\n1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:06.060\n Yeah, I mean, the tragic aspect of that is\n\n1:46:08.020 --> 1:46:10.580\n like, I guess Kyle lost, right?\n\n1:46:10.580 --> 1:46:12.540\n So like if you look at the record\n\n1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:14.140\n and all the kind of things,\n\n1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:17.820\n perhaps like you look at the career,\n\n1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:20.340\n maybe like as a financial,\n\n1:46:21.940 --> 1:46:24.500\n from a financial perspective that perhaps is not\n\n1:46:25.540 --> 1:46:28.340\n the greatest thing for Kyle's career\n\n1:46:28.340 --> 1:46:32.140\n or that or in the history of the UFC,\n\n1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:36.740\n perhaps it's not like maybe many people\n\n1:46:36.740 --> 1:46:38.060\n didn't even watch that fight,\n\n1:46:38.060 --> 1:46:40.860\n but it was a special moment that stands in the history.\n\n1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:44.900\n There's not many of these in the history of fighting.\n\n1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:45.780\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:46:45.780 --> 1:46:47.500\n when you look at someone's career in the UFC,\n\n1:46:47.500 --> 1:46:52.500\n like financially, there's a handful of people\n\n1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:54.820\n that make real money.\n\n1:46:54.820 --> 1:46:56.540\n Everybody else makes nothing.\n\n1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:58.740\n There's a handful of people that make real money.\n\n1:46:58.740 --> 1:47:02.460\n So did that loss cost him in the near term?\n\n1:47:02.460 --> 1:47:04.220\n Sure, but when you look back on your life,\n\n1:47:04.220 --> 1:47:05.620\n you're not gonna look back on that loss\n\n1:47:05.620 --> 1:47:07.740\n as something that derailed my life financially\n\n1:47:07.740 --> 1:47:08.900\n and I never recovered from it.\n\n1:47:08.900 --> 1:47:10.580\n That's not gonna happen.\n\n1:47:10.580 --> 1:47:13.180\n Like the sad thing is, is unless you were a champion\n\n1:47:13.180 --> 1:47:15.580\n and most people are gonna be forgotten\n\n1:47:15.580 --> 1:47:16.960\n right after they're gone.\n\n1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:18.220\n Most people will be forgotten.\n\n1:47:18.220 --> 1:47:19.560\n And if you're not forgotten,\n\n1:47:19.560 --> 1:47:22.520\n certainly your accolades are gonna be misrepresented.\n\n1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:24.540\n Either they're gonna be inflated or diminished\n\n1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:25.360\n one way or the other.\n\n1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:30.360\n So looking back on it, it's just so hard to quantify that.\n\n1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:32.340\n But it's an experience.\n\n1:47:32.340 --> 1:47:34.540\n And when you're in that moment\n\n1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:38.140\n and you're one of the people intimately involved in it,\n\n1:47:38.140 --> 1:47:42.460\n the value of that experience supersedes any financial gain.\n\n1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:46.860\n Where would you put Khabib\n\n1:47:46.860 --> 1:47:48.620\n in the discussion of the greatest of all time?\n\n1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:50.700\n So you recently, we worked together,\n\n1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:55.700\n we watched the fight of him and Justin Gaethje\n\n1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:58.740\n and Khabib retired.\n\n1:47:58.740 --> 1:48:02.140\n Would you put him up there as one of the greatest\n\n1:48:02.140 --> 1:48:05.620\n or did he never truly find his foil,\n\n1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:08.500\n like the great warrior that challenged him?\n\n1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:13.500\n And maybe do you think he's fully retired now?\n\n1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:15.620\n To answer the question about being fully retired,\n\n1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:16.660\n I don't have any idea.\n\n1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:21.660\n I can't for a second pretend to think that I understand\n\n1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:24.300\n the way that people from that part of the world\n\n1:48:24.300 --> 1:48:26.900\n think and respect their family and things like that.\n\n1:48:26.900 --> 1:48:27.840\n To an American who says,\n\n1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:29.580\n oh, I promised my mom I wouldn't do it.\n\n1:48:29.580 --> 1:48:31.660\n I mean, I promised my mom I wouldn't do a lot of things.\n\n1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:33.940\n I went right out the fucking back door and did them.\n\n1:48:33.940 --> 1:48:36.020\n But I think that that means something different\n\n1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:37.940\n to people in different parts of the world.\n\n1:48:37.940 --> 1:48:41.240\n So I have no idea what kind of weight that carries.\n\n1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:42.780\n So I can't answer that.\n\n1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:45.960\n I can say a lot of times when people think\n\n1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:47.260\n about great fighters,\n\n1:48:47.260 --> 1:48:50.540\n they think about the aspects that make up MMA.\n\n1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:52.860\n Like they think of MMA as a pie\n\n1:48:52.860 --> 1:48:56.300\n and they're all these different pieces that make up the pie.\n\n1:48:56.300 --> 1:48:57.340\n And how good is this piece?\n\n1:48:57.340 --> 1:48:58.160\n And how good is this piece?\n\n1:48:58.160 --> 1:48:59.780\n And how good is this piece?\n\n1:48:59.780 --> 1:49:00.960\n When the fact of the matter is\n\n1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:05.260\n is you only need one really, really, really good piece.\n\n1:49:05.260 --> 1:49:07.300\n And the other pieces are complimentary pieces\n\n1:49:07.300 --> 1:49:10.540\n to get you to where you're the strongest.\n\n1:49:10.540 --> 1:49:12.620\n And if you want to tell me\n\n1:49:12.620 --> 1:49:14.820\n that Khabib's not the greatest MMA fighter\n\n1:49:14.820 --> 1:49:17.820\n because he doesn't have really slick striking,\n\n1:49:17.820 --> 1:49:19.180\n you can make that argument.\n\n1:49:19.180 --> 1:49:22.160\n But what I can tell you is Khabib has good enough striking\n\n1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:23.780\n to get him to his grappling\n\n1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:27.360\n where he is clearly the best guy at 155 they've ever seen.\n\n1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:29.100\n So does that make him the greatest fighter\n\n1:49:29.100 --> 1:49:30.840\n in that division or not?\n\n1:49:31.940 --> 1:49:33.520\n To your point about the foil,\n\n1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:35.340\n they wanted Connor to be his foil\n\n1:49:35.340 --> 1:49:37.080\n and he just manhandled them.\n\n1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:39.320\n I mean, they wanted that to happen.\n\n1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:40.240\n Did not happen.\n\n1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:45.040\n Well, there's a kind of argument to be made which we kind of,\n\n1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:47.800\n now you get haters in this argument\n\n1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:50.160\n and you're going to be one of the haters\n\n1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:53.280\n because I know your, how should I put it?\n\n1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:57.320\n Lack of admiration for Connor McGregor.\n\n1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.560\n But, what is it?\n\n1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:03.160\n Football is a game of inches?\n\n1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:03.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:08.920\n There's a sense where that Connor,\n\n1:50:08.920 --> 1:50:10.340\n there's an argument to be made\n\n1:50:10.340 --> 1:50:13.020\n that Connor wasn't exactly dominated,\n\n1:50:13.020 --> 1:50:14.240\n that he ended up being dominant,\n\n1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:16.680\n meaning, let me phrase it differently,\n\n1:50:16.680 --> 1:50:20.280\n is there's a lot of points in the fight\n\n1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:24.440\n that a different trajectory could have happened.\n\n1:50:24.440 --> 1:50:27.460\n So he wasn't so far from having a chance\n\n1:50:27.460 --> 1:50:28.600\n at winning that fight.\n\n1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:30.280\n It's just the end.\n\n1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:31.120\n You can focus.\n\n1:50:31.120 --> 1:50:34.040\n Those are the most important moments at the end.\n\n1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:35.740\n You've lost the most important moments.\n\n1:50:35.740 --> 1:50:37.940\n Right, but the road less taken.\n\n1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:39.400\n It could have been,\n\n1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:42.640\n if he didn't lose those very important moments,\n\n1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:43.560\n he had a chance.\n\n1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:46.700\n I'm saying out of all the people that Khabib fought,\n\n1:50:46.700 --> 1:50:49.080\n it's arguable that Connor was up there\n\n1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:51.080\n of the people that had a chance.\n\n1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:52.640\n Let me say this first.\n\n1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:55.800\n I love.\n\n1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:56.620\n I'm going to get so much heat for this.\n\n1:50:56.620 --> 1:50:57.640\n I do love Khabib.\n\n1:50:57.640 --> 1:50:59.080\n I'm a huge Khabib fan\n\n1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:01.200\n because I'm a grappler first and foremost.\n\n1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:03.020\n Me too, because I'm also Russian.\n\n1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:05.280\n I love Khabib, calm down.\n\n1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:06.120\n Okay.\n\n1:51:06.120 --> 1:51:08.760\n When Connor came on the scene,\n\n1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:10.800\n I loved Connor because I'm an Irish American\n\n1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:12.800\n and I want to support him and things like that.\n\n1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:14.540\n And he was good fun.\n\n1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:17.920\n He got to be, for my personal taste,\n\n1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:19.060\n he got to be too much.\n\n1:51:20.020 --> 1:51:22.240\n Of all the people Khabib has fought,\n\n1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:25.440\n I would never fight Connor again if I were him.\n\n1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:26.480\n And here's why.\n\n1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:28.280\n And I said this about the Diaz fight.\n\n1:51:29.500 --> 1:51:32.240\n Nate Diaz, who was one of my favorite fighters,\n\n1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:34.720\n has fought the exact same fight for 12 years.\n\n1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:37.560\n Connor will switch something up to give himself an edge.\n\n1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:41.440\n And I believe that Connor would figure something out\n\n1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:43.800\n in fight number two, I think,\n\n1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:46.460\n but I also thought that Gagey would give Khabib problems\n\n1:51:46.460 --> 1:51:48.320\n where it wouldn't be a matter of\n\n1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:49.800\n I'm going to out wrestle Khabib\n\n1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:54.040\n or become better at defending his wrestling takedowns.\n\n1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:56.520\n Connor would have figured out a way to not get wrestled.\n\n1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.800\n I feel like he's constantly changing.\n\n1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:00.440\n He's constantly evolving.\n\n1:52:00.440 --> 1:52:02.520\n And whether or not people realize it or not,\n\n1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:05.520\n I think Connor's one of the better overall athletes in MMA\n\n1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:07.840\n just from looking at his body and his movement\n\n1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:08.840\n and the way he's shaped.\n\n1:52:08.840 --> 1:52:10.280\n He's got a very tiny waist.\n\n1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:13.120\n He's got really pronounced glutes and shoulders.\n\n1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:15.400\n And I think he's a for real athlete.\n\n1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.560\n Whereas a lot of guys in MMA are not for real athletes.\n\n1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:20.360\n They're just good at one of the things that makes up MMA.\n\n1:52:21.400 --> 1:52:23.720\n I understand what you're saying about\n\n1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:25.560\n if this happened, if that happened,\n\n1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:26.520\n but I mean, you could say that\n\n1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:29.700\n about every single combat sports event ever.\n\n1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:32.280\n If Spinks's hook landed on Tyson,\n\n1:52:32.280 --> 1:52:34.760\n maybe that fight didn't end the way that it did,\n\n1:52:34.760 --> 1:52:35.840\n but you know what?\n\n1:52:35.840 --> 1:52:36.920\n It didn't.\n\n1:52:36.920 --> 1:52:37.800\n You're absolutely right.\n\n1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:40.520\n But if we could talk about just Connor McGregor\n\n1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:41.360\n for a second,\n\n1:52:43.400 --> 1:52:46.340\n I can't wait to get your fan mail or hate mail.\n\n1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:50.360\n Speak to the innovation of Connor.\n\n1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:53.280\n I don't hear very many people making this argument,\n\n1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:56.400\n but is it possible to make an argument\n\n1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:58.680\n that Connor McGregor is one of the greatest fighters\n\n1:52:58.680 --> 1:52:59.520\n of all time?\n\n1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:01.480\n It's an interesting argument.\n\n1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:03.840\n And the problem, the only problem with the argument\n\n1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:06.040\n is there's so much emotion on either side.\n\n1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:08.280\n Yeah, I had a conversation, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:53:08.280 --> 1:53:13.280\n with Yaron Brook, who is a philosopher,\n\n1:53:13.640 --> 1:53:18.640\n objectivist, which is the philosophy of Ayn Rand.\n\n1:53:18.860 --> 1:53:22.760\n And the amount of emotion around that particular human\n\n1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:23.720\n is fascinating to me.\n\n1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:27.320\n It's similar to the amount of emotion around Donald Trump.\n\n1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:30.120\n You can think of different personalities, maybe Elon Musk.\n\n1:53:30.120 --> 1:53:31.240\n Those are the people that aren't willing\n\n1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:32.280\n to have their mind changed.\n\n1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:34.640\n They're too emotionally attached to the argument.\n\n1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:37.400\n Yeah, but it's weird that why do we,\n\n1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:42.040\n why some people inspire so much emotion and others don't?\n\n1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:46.040\n But Connor McGregor, I feel like nobody's able\n\n1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:51.040\n to have a calm fight analysis of the guy.\n\n1:53:52.220 --> 1:53:57.220\n Look, to me, as just a fan of martial arts,\n\n1:53:57.220 --> 1:54:00.700\n like I studied judo, I love watching just hours\n\n1:54:00.700 --> 1:54:04.500\n of Olympic judo and appreciating the art form.\n\n1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:06.980\n Like I forget the humans involved.\n\n1:54:06.980 --> 1:54:09.900\n Teddy Renner, who's a heavyweight,\n\n1:54:09.900 --> 1:54:11.940\n the most probably the most dominant heavyweight\n\n1:54:11.940 --> 1:54:14.620\n in the history of judo, just studying his gripping,\n\n1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:16.180\n just the art of it.\n\n1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:18.340\n And who cares if there's shit talking?\n\n1:54:18.340 --> 1:54:21.860\n Like to me, I put all of that aside\n\n1:54:21.860 --> 1:54:23.460\n and just look at the art.\n\n1:54:23.460 --> 1:54:27.860\n And like what I really appreciate about Connor McGregor\n\n1:54:27.860 --> 1:54:32.860\n is his innovation, like of movement,\n\n1:54:33.540 --> 1:54:36.980\n of maybe it's romanticized, maybe you can correct me.\n\n1:54:36.980 --> 1:54:41.620\n I'm just a Cheeto eating fan of mixed martial arts,\n\n1:54:41.620 --> 1:54:45.340\n but like I seem to detect more innovation\n\n1:54:45.340 --> 1:54:47.540\n than almost any other fighter\n\n1:54:47.540 --> 1:54:51.660\n that I've paid attention to in Connor McGregor.\n\n1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.180\n I think first, I'll answer in two parts.\n\n1:54:54.180 --> 1:54:56.500\n I think, well, I'm not gonna answer the first part.\n\n1:54:56.500 --> 1:54:58.720\n It's just a comment, because you didn't ask the question.\n\n1:54:58.720 --> 1:54:59.560\n What was the question?\n\n1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:00.780\n I don't even remember.\n\n1:55:00.780 --> 1:55:04.740\n It's about how Connor McGregor fans are very emotional\n\n1:55:04.740 --> 1:55:07.220\n and Connor McGregor detractors are very emotional.\n\n1:55:07.220 --> 1:55:09.060\n I think fans become very emotional.\n\n1:55:09.060 --> 1:55:11.340\n They become cheerleaders of someone like Connor McGregor\n\n1:55:11.340 --> 1:55:13.860\n or Donald Trump, because they see that person\n\n1:55:13.860 --> 1:55:16.780\n exhibiting the qualities that they themselves lack.\n\n1:55:16.780 --> 1:55:18.500\n And so they become cheerleaders for that, right?\n\n1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:20.860\n And I think that for the most part,\n\n1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:23.380\n people who are detractors of Connor McGregors,\n\n1:55:23.380 --> 1:55:25.700\n they're not really Connor McGregor detractors.\n\n1:55:25.700 --> 1:55:28.340\n They're detractors of Connor supporters.\n\n1:55:28.340 --> 1:55:29.660\n There's a beef that they have\n\n1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:31.380\n with the people in that bucket, right?\n\n1:55:31.380 --> 1:55:33.620\n Like, it's not really a problem.\n\n1:55:33.620 --> 1:55:37.380\n And that applies probably in our current political climate,\n\n1:55:37.380 --> 1:55:39.460\n Donald Trump with the left and the right.\n\n1:55:39.460 --> 1:55:44.340\n It's more about like, they actually don't like\n\n1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:47.420\n on the other, the caricature, the most extreme versions\n\n1:55:47.420 --> 1:55:50.380\n of what they see in the supporters of the other side.\n\n1:55:50.380 --> 1:55:51.220\n Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n1:55:51.220 --> 1:55:52.460\n But I think the more interesting thing\n\n1:55:52.460 --> 1:55:53.540\n is the fighter himself.\n\n1:55:53.540 --> 1:55:55.220\n So let's put the supporters aside.\n\n1:55:55.220 --> 1:55:59.580\n I would say that, you know, what some people know\n\n1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:01.180\n and some people don't know is that Connor's base\n\n1:56:01.180 --> 1:56:06.180\n is in karate and the karate style of Connor McGregor,\n\n1:56:06.540 --> 1:56:10.620\n Steven Thompson, of Lyoto Machida,\n\n1:56:10.620 --> 1:56:12.660\n that type of distance management,\n\n1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:14.540\n a lot of times we think as martial artists,\n\n1:56:14.540 --> 1:56:17.460\n we think that the sport version of the art\n\n1:56:17.460 --> 1:56:21.060\n we've chosen to pursue somehow taints the authenticity\n\n1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:24.020\n and the effectiveness of it.\n\n1:56:24.020 --> 1:56:26.020\n But point karate is what led to that\n\n1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:28.940\n in and out distance management style of Connor,\n\n1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:31.100\n of Lyoto and of Steven Thompson.\n\n1:56:31.100 --> 1:56:33.420\n They all kind of use it a little bit differently,\n\n1:56:33.420 --> 1:56:36.260\n but they use it very effectively, all three of them.\n\n1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:41.180\n And that comes from a world of trying to kind of like\n\n1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:43.860\n step in, land contact on you from my point\n\n1:56:43.860 --> 1:56:47.380\n and then get back out before you can counterstrike me, right?\n\n1:56:47.380 --> 1:56:49.020\n And that's where that comes from.\n\n1:56:49.020 --> 1:56:52.380\n Connor is blessed to have a longer arms\n\n1:56:52.380 --> 1:56:54.580\n than someone his height probably normally has.\n\n1:56:54.580 --> 1:56:57.700\n And his movement is just so fluid.\n\n1:56:57.700 --> 1:57:01.540\n He's so athletic with the hinges of his body,\n\n1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.820\n the knees and the hips and the swivel of his body,\n\n1:57:04.820 --> 1:57:06.820\n which is also the hips and the shoulders.\n\n1:57:07.780 --> 1:57:09.900\n His movement, his distance,\n\n1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:12.740\n and the way he sets people up for the straight left hand\n\n1:57:12.740 --> 1:57:14.220\n while you're circling away from it\n\n1:57:14.220 --> 1:57:15.140\n and he can still land it,\n\n1:57:15.140 --> 1:57:17.060\n which is what he did to Chad Mendes.\n\n1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:17.980\n Hit him with a straight left\n\n1:57:17.980 --> 1:57:20.100\n while he was circling away from it.\n\n1:57:20.100 --> 1:57:24.060\n That is something that is very beautiful to watch.\n\n1:57:24.060 --> 1:57:27.100\n And sometimes people see the kicks\n\n1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:30.740\n and they see all the flashy snap kicks and the sidekicks.\n\n1:57:30.740 --> 1:57:32.860\n All that stuff is doing is setting people up\n\n1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:34.140\n for the left hand.\n\n1:57:34.140 --> 1:57:34.980\n It's all it's doing.\n\n1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:37.140\n It's you're corralling people, you're funneling people,\n\n1:57:37.140 --> 1:57:39.140\n or you're leading the dance and you're bringing them\n\n1:57:39.140 --> 1:57:41.740\n to a spot where you know you can land that left hand.\n\n1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:45.780\n And his ability to do that is masterful.\n\n1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:48.820\n People constantly shit on his ability to grapple\n\n1:57:48.820 --> 1:57:50.020\n because a couple of his losses\n\n1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:52.860\n have been to jujitsu guys or grapplers,\n\n1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:55.380\n but they've been to really good guys.\n\n1:57:55.380 --> 1:57:56.780\n Anyone who's gonna sit here and tell me\n\n1:57:56.780 --> 1:58:00.180\n Conor McGregor's not a good grappler, go grapple him.\n\n1:58:00.180 --> 1:58:02.020\n Let me see you grapple him.\n\n1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:05.020\n To that point, I'll also say a lot of people\n\n1:58:05.020 --> 1:58:08.380\n will use Conor McGregor's X guard sweep on Nate Diaz\n\n1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:11.500\n as evidence to his high level grappling in that fight,\n\n1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:13.460\n to which I would also counter,\n\n1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:14.780\n Nate Diaz didn't fight that off\n\n1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:16.820\n because he knew he was so much better at jujitsu\n\n1:58:16.820 --> 1:58:19.660\n off the bottom that he didn't even care if he got swept.\n\n1:58:19.660 --> 1:58:21.860\n So is Conor McGregor innovative?\n\n1:58:21.860 --> 1:58:22.700\n Absolutely.\n\n1:58:23.780 --> 1:58:25.540\n Is he one of the best fighters ever?\n\n1:58:25.540 --> 1:58:27.580\n It's tough to say because he's such a cash cow\n\n1:58:27.580 --> 1:58:28.940\n that he was fed people.\n\n1:58:28.940 --> 1:58:32.700\n I firmly believe no one who put\n\n1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:34.420\n that Conor McGregor Khabib fight together\n\n1:58:34.420 --> 1:58:35.620\n thought Khabib would win.\n\n1:58:36.620 --> 1:58:38.140\n Wow.\n\n1:58:38.140 --> 1:58:42.940\n I remember, so at that time it was not completely clear.\n\n1:58:42.940 --> 1:58:45.220\n There was a myth of the great Khabib.\n\n1:58:45.220 --> 1:58:48.420\n It wasn't completely clear how good is he really.\n\n1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:49.820\n So that's interesting.\n\n1:58:49.820 --> 1:58:53.140\n And it was unclear how good is Conor also.\n\n1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:57.780\n Because I think to me,\n\n1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:00.500\n maybe part of my admiration of Conor McGregor\n\n1:59:00.500 --> 1:59:02.340\n is rooted in the fact that I thought\n\n1:59:02.340 --> 1:59:05.300\n there was no way he beats Jose Aldo\n\n1:59:05.300 --> 1:59:07.660\n and I thought there's definitely no way\n\n1:59:07.660 --> 1:59:09.140\n he beats Eddie Alvarez.\n\n1:59:09.140 --> 1:59:10.740\n And so like when he did,\n\n1:59:10.740 --> 1:59:15.740\n I was like, my brain was like,\n\n1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:18.060\n there's something broken.\n\n1:59:18.060 --> 1:59:20.220\n It was like shut down, like on windows, like froze.\n\n1:59:20.220 --> 1:59:21.740\n We have to rethink this.\n\n1:59:21.740 --> 1:59:23.380\n Like this is a special human.\n\n1:59:23.380 --> 1:59:25.780\n Now people who argue he's not even in the running\n\n1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:28.340\n of like top 20 is,\n\n1:59:28.340 --> 1:59:30.380\n if you look at the number of defenses, for example,\n\n1:59:30.380 --> 1:59:32.660\n of his belt that he had very, very little.\n\n1:59:32.660 --> 1:59:34.580\n But like to me, I'm one of those people\n\n1:59:34.580 --> 1:59:36.540\n is back to our discussion of like,\n\n1:59:36.540 --> 1:59:38.340\n do moments make great fighters?\n\n1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:41.300\n That I think just being able to beat Jose Aldo\n\n1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:43.300\n and I would argue in his prime,\n\n1:59:43.300 --> 1:59:45.780\n some people might disagree in this,\n\n1:59:49.020 --> 1:59:51.820\n in a way where he like figures out the puzzle,\n\n1:59:51.820 --> 1:59:53.940\n gets in his head the entirety of the picture.\n\n1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:57.580\n And then to be, I mean, Eddie Alvarez,\n\n1:59:57.580 --> 2:00:00.500\n would he be considered a really strong wrestler?\n\n2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:04.260\n Like, or not strong wrestler,\n\n2:00:04.260 --> 2:00:05.700\n strong striker and wrestler,\n\n2:00:05.700 --> 2:00:06.740\n the whole combination of it.\n\n2:00:06.740 --> 2:00:09.340\n And also what's the other wrestler he fought?\n\n2:00:09.340 --> 2:00:10.660\n Chad Mendes. Chad Mendes.\n\n2:00:10.660 --> 2:00:13.500\n So let me comment on all those if I may.\n\n2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:15.700\n So I was at the Chad Mendes fight live.\n\n2:00:15.700 --> 2:00:18.820\n And there was a jujitsu tournament, we're out in Vegas.\n\n2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:20.180\n And so me and my best friend came out\n\n2:00:20.180 --> 2:00:21.420\n and we got some tickets.\n\n2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:24.300\n That night was supposed to be the first Aldo fight.\n\n2:00:24.300 --> 2:00:27.300\n Aldo got hurt, like right after I bought the tickets.\n\n2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:28.700\n They pulled Chad Mendes in.\n\n2:00:28.700 --> 2:00:30.380\n He was a little bit out of shape, whatever.\n\n2:00:30.380 --> 2:00:32.340\n You still got to fight the fight.\n\n2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:36.900\n But I don't want to use that fight as evidence\n\n2:00:36.900 --> 2:00:39.700\n to Conor's greatness because they pulled Chad Mendes in.\n\n2:00:39.700 --> 2:00:41.860\n He was like hunting and drinking beers in the woods\n\n2:00:41.860 --> 2:00:43.460\n and was a little out of shape.\n\n2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:45.420\n But if you want to talk about greatness,\n\n2:00:45.420 --> 2:00:49.820\n like that surpasses your in ring accomplishments.\n\n2:00:50.860 --> 2:00:52.740\n I was in the stands that night\n\n2:00:52.740 --> 2:00:56.420\n and the people that came from Ireland\n\n2:00:56.420 --> 2:00:58.060\n to see Conor fight that night,\n\n2:00:58.060 --> 2:01:00.740\n single handedly set the market\n\n2:01:00.740 --> 2:01:03.820\n for hotel room prices and airline tickets to Vegas\n\n2:01:03.820 --> 2:01:05.140\n that weekend.\n\n2:01:05.140 --> 2:01:07.980\n These motherfuckers were all dressed like Conor\n\n2:01:07.980 --> 2:01:09.020\n in the stands.\n\n2:01:09.020 --> 2:01:11.580\n They had wool suits on and big beards\n\n2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:12.420\n and the whole thing.\n\n2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:14.540\n I mean, they probably weren't pocket watches.\n\n2:01:14.540 --> 2:01:19.100\n I never saw more people trying to be someone else.\n\n2:01:19.100 --> 2:01:21.580\n Never saw more people try to be someone else.\n\n2:01:21.580 --> 2:01:23.060\n I mean, there's a level of,\n\n2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:24.540\n is there a level of greatness in that?\n\n2:01:24.540 --> 2:01:26.700\n I mean, I don't know how to parse all that out.\n\n2:01:26.700 --> 2:01:28.420\n You're somebody who doesn't admire that.\n\n2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:31.700\n I love that in the sense, the following sense, I think.\n\n2:01:31.700 --> 2:01:34.540\n And people don't seem to hold this belief at all,\n\n2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:36.980\n but to me, fighting is not just,\n\n2:01:37.900 --> 2:01:42.580\n this isn't like a quiet street fight that nobody watches.\n\n2:01:42.580 --> 2:01:43.820\n This is also a spectacle.\n\n2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:45.580\n This is also a story.\n\n2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:48.460\n There's like, there's a professional wrestling element\n\n2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:49.300\n to this.\n\n2:01:49.300 --> 2:01:51.540\n This is not, like you think it's just about fighting.\n\n2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:54.220\n If it was just about fighting, you wouldn't,\n\n2:01:54.220 --> 2:01:56.780\n I mean, there's a story to it, I guess,\n\n2:01:56.780 --> 2:01:58.580\n is what I'm trying to get to.\n\n2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:01.300\n And greatness has to incorporate that.\n\n2:02:01.300 --> 2:02:04.300\n People that criticize, again, I might be wrong on this,\n\n2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:07.620\n but I honestly think that Conor McGregor,\n\n2:02:07.620 --> 2:02:10.060\n not nearly as much as Khabib,\n\n2:02:10.060 --> 2:02:13.460\n but he's a true martial artist.\n\n2:02:13.460 --> 2:02:17.580\n I think he respects his opponents despite the talk.\n\n2:02:17.580 --> 2:02:19.220\n Maybe I'm misreading it,\n\n2:02:19.220 --> 2:02:22.260\n but it feels like he is a storyteller,\n\n2:02:22.260 --> 2:02:27.020\n like Chael Sonnen type of like, he's constructed this image\n\n2:02:27.020 --> 2:02:30.060\n to play the story, like just the way he acts\n\n2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:33.540\n after the fight, the honor he shows to his opponents.\n\n2:02:33.540 --> 2:02:35.980\n There's a real martial artist in there,\n\n2:02:35.980 --> 2:02:40.980\n and to dismiss the fact that the story of the fight\n\n2:02:41.820 --> 2:02:44.340\n is part of it, because he doesn't just shit talk.\n\n2:02:44.340 --> 2:02:46.500\n This is what people don't seem to understand.\n\n2:02:46.500 --> 2:02:48.300\n He's good at shit talking.\n\n2:02:48.300 --> 2:02:52.420\n Very good, and I'm with you on basically everything you said.\n\n2:02:53.380 --> 2:02:55.060\n I think that there's greatness to that,\n\n2:02:55.060 --> 2:02:57.940\n and I think that he understands how to sell a fight,\n\n2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:02.940\n and I think what he did to Jose Aldo by getting in his head\n\n2:03:05.620 --> 2:03:06.940\n helped him win that fight.\n\n2:03:08.620 --> 2:03:12.180\n He insulted Jose Aldo and his country so much\n\n2:03:12.180 --> 2:03:14.380\n that he knew Aldo was gonna come forward\n\n2:03:14.380 --> 2:03:15.660\n right into that left hook.\n\n2:03:15.660 --> 2:03:17.420\n Was that fight in Brazil, by the way?\n\n2:03:17.420 --> 2:03:18.260\n Do you remember?\n\n2:03:18.260 --> 2:03:19.100\n I don't recall.\n\n2:03:19.100 --> 2:03:20.540\n Because I know he insulted all of Brazil,\n\n2:03:20.540 --> 2:03:22.460\n but I'm not sure if it was in Brazil.\n\n2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:23.940\n But when he tried to do that to Khabib,\n\n2:03:23.940 --> 2:03:25.420\n you could tell that he just was not gonna get\n\n2:03:25.420 --> 2:03:26.260\n in Khabib's head.\n\n2:03:26.260 --> 2:03:27.820\n Khabib was unflappable.\n\n2:03:27.820 --> 2:03:30.780\n But there is definitely something great\n\n2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:33.420\n about how he moves people.\n\n2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:37.660\n The Irish are like, I mean, Conor's walkout music,\n\n2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:41.260\n for people from Ireland of Irish descent,\n\n2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:43.580\n that shit is like very deep.\n\n2:03:43.580 --> 2:03:47.740\n You know, it's a very emotional song.\n\n2:03:47.740 --> 2:03:51.500\n I was, to be honest, a little bit upset with Khabib,\n\n2:03:51.500 --> 2:03:54.180\n that he didn't rise.\n\n2:03:54.180 --> 2:03:56.780\n I admire that entire culture.\n\n2:03:56.780 --> 2:03:59.300\n But there's an aspect to where he could have risen\n\n2:03:59.300 --> 2:04:03.940\n to the occasion of there's the same kind of depth\n\n2:04:03.940 --> 2:04:08.300\n of love of country that Russia has.\n\n2:04:10.140 --> 2:04:11.780\n Is there in Dagestan?\n\n2:04:11.780 --> 2:04:15.060\n Dagestan is a little weird in terms of like,\n\n2:04:15.060 --> 2:04:18.340\n but he could have, especially with Putin's support,\n\n2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:22.220\n wear for a bit the full Russian hat\n\n2:04:22.220 --> 2:04:23.980\n of like this is the great nation.\n\n2:04:23.980 --> 2:04:28.260\n Like rise above the culture of Dagestan,\n\n2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:31.100\n which is a small town boy with the small town values\n\n2:04:31.100 --> 2:04:33.080\n of family and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:36.620\n There's a moment where you inspire entire nations.\n\n2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:40.340\n Like the step up and be the foil\n\n2:04:40.340 --> 2:04:45.340\n to the great Conor McGregor where also Khabib\n\n2:04:45.900 --> 2:04:48.780\n becomes the foil to, like both of them\n\n2:04:48.780 --> 2:04:51.440\n are the foil to each other and become like,\n\n2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:54.500\n that fight was already a great fight, right?\n\n2:04:54.500 --> 2:04:57.060\n But it could have been something historic.\n\n2:04:57.060 --> 2:05:00.340\n Ali versus Fred, I mean, it could have been really historic.\n\n2:05:00.340 --> 2:05:05.340\n And I would argue, I guess the biggest disappointment I have,\n\n2:05:05.620 --> 2:05:08.700\n and I understand it and I also honor it as a martial artist,\n\n2:05:08.700 --> 2:05:13.300\n but to, I'm disappointed that Khabib doesn't seem\n\n2:05:13.300 --> 2:05:17.700\n to even consider the possibility of doing in Moscow\n\n2:05:18.580 --> 2:05:23.580\n fight number two, and because that could be narrative wise\n\n2:05:23.580 --> 2:05:26.100\n if they do it right, that's one of the,\n\n2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:29.420\n could be one of the greatest fights in history.\n\n2:05:29.420 --> 2:05:34.420\n Yeah, I think in terms of Khabib and inspiring a country,\n\n2:05:34.420 --> 2:05:39.420\n is it possible that by staying true to the values\n\n2:05:39.740 --> 2:05:44.260\n that he had his entire career and getting to the zenith\n\n2:05:44.260 --> 2:05:49.120\n of his art form and still doing it in that humble way,\n\n2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:50.940\n isn't it possible that that inspires?\n\n2:05:50.940 --> 2:05:55.020\n Yeah, 100%, so I should clarify that I think\n\n2:05:55.020 --> 2:05:56.900\n they're just hearing from people,\n\n2:05:56.900 --> 2:06:01.900\n from my fellow comrades, no, is they love that.\n\n2:06:01.900 --> 2:06:05.260\n They love that, but they.\n\n2:06:06.700 --> 2:06:09.420\n There's also a brash, beer chugging, shit talking thing\n\n2:06:09.420 --> 2:06:12.500\n that people really like about Connor, and I do love that.\n\n2:06:12.500 --> 2:06:15.300\n But the beautiful narrative would have been the clash,\n\n2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:17.220\n the real clash of those cultures.\n\n2:06:17.220 --> 2:06:22.220\n So Khabib chooses to live the culture by walking away.\n\n2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:27.540\n There's also like a clash of them sort of walking,\n\n2:06:27.540 --> 2:06:31.580\n not walking away from the fire, but walking into the fire\n\n2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:33.740\n of this brashness.\n\n2:06:33.740 --> 2:06:38.740\n It's the sort of the cool collected calmness\n\n2:06:40.020 --> 2:06:41.660\n of the Dagestan people.\n\n2:06:41.660 --> 2:06:43.740\n It's like you were talking about the Saitya brothers.\n\n2:06:43.740 --> 2:06:46.580\n So they just view it totally differently.\n\n2:06:46.580 --> 2:06:50.140\n And there are stereotypes about the Irish\n\n2:06:50.140 --> 2:06:52.800\n where they're maybe potentially a louder,\n\n2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:54.700\n more boisterous culture.\n\n2:06:55.660 --> 2:06:57.420\n Haven't heard of that, yeah.\n\n2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:01.700\n And I mean, I thought they each played their part perfectly.\n\n2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:04.780\n And all those things that you're describing\n\n2:07:04.780 --> 2:07:05.620\n could have happened.\n\n2:07:05.620 --> 2:07:08.340\n Maybe Khabib steps up and he carries the proverbial flag,\n\n2:07:08.340 --> 2:07:10.940\n so to speak, for a nation of people and they go to battle.\n\n2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:12.740\n But the fight, if it plays out the same way,\n\n2:07:12.740 --> 2:07:13.980\n is still the fight.\n\n2:07:13.980 --> 2:07:16.540\n And it was an okay fight.\n\n2:07:16.540 --> 2:07:17.940\n It wasn't a great fight.\n\n2:07:17.940 --> 2:07:21.180\n It was, you know, the fight was okay.\n\n2:07:21.180 --> 2:07:26.100\n And I think that, again, I don't have any idea\n\n2:07:26.100 --> 2:07:28.820\n what Khabib's obligations to his family are.\n\n2:07:28.820 --> 2:07:33.820\n I don't think either of those guys want for more money.\n\n2:07:34.100 --> 2:07:38.000\n To do another fight is just a legacy thing.\n\n2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:43.000\n It's just about fulfilling some part of a legacy.\n\n2:07:44.180 --> 2:07:49.180\n And I just, I admire the possibility of a great legacy\n\n2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:51.860\n that is bigger than either of the fighters.\n\n2:07:51.860 --> 2:07:56.380\n I think with Khabib, he kind of, he's not as concerned\n\n2:07:56.380 --> 2:07:57.460\n about legacy, I think.\n\n2:07:57.460 --> 2:07:58.300\n Right.\n\n2:07:58.300 --> 2:07:59.140\n There's a...\n\n2:07:59.140 --> 2:08:01.900\n Your promoter's dream, because you want the rematch,\n\n2:08:01.900 --> 2:08:03.220\n and the only thing that makes more money\n\n2:08:03.220 --> 2:08:05.540\n than the rematch is the trilogy.\n\n2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:09.020\n You gotta split the rematch, you hope Conor wins,\n\n2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:10.500\n and then you have the trilogy fight.\n\n2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:11.820\n And now you're all in.\n\n2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:13.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:13.020 --> 2:08:15.340\n Yeah, I can't get into Khabib's head,\n\n2:08:15.340 --> 2:08:19.380\n but I know Putin, just the game, the entirety of it,\n\n2:08:19.380 --> 2:08:20.340\n especially at the time,\n\n2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:22.340\n especially if it was Trump as president,\n\n2:08:24.340 --> 2:08:26.420\n if he was as president at the time,\n\n2:08:26.420 --> 2:08:30.280\n and Putin, and in Russia,\n\n2:08:30.280 --> 2:08:34.540\n and just knowing how masterful Conor is at,\n\n2:08:35.460 --> 2:08:37.420\n because Conor would be a different Conor.\n\n2:08:37.420 --> 2:08:39.300\n I think he would be a calmer Conor.\n\n2:08:39.300 --> 2:08:40.660\n There would be a different,\n\n2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:43.820\n because you don't wanna be over the top Conor\n\n2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:44.860\n with the Russian people.\n\n2:08:44.860 --> 2:08:46.700\n Right, no, that's...\n\n2:08:46.700 --> 2:08:48.740\n It's like, ah, this is dangerous ground.\n\n2:08:48.740 --> 2:08:53.420\n See, that was the episode in the hotel in Brooklyn\n\n2:08:53.420 --> 2:08:58.420\n when some of the Russian guys confronted Artem,\n\n2:08:58.420 --> 2:09:00.140\n and then Conor came over.\n\n2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:02.520\n It's not, but the danger of that.\n\n2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:05.940\n I mean, there is the element of just like real danger,\n\n2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:08.340\n and the real, it was almost of war.\n\n2:09:08.340 --> 2:09:11.260\n It's, I don't know, it's...\n\n2:09:11.260 --> 2:09:14.940\n It was like when Chael Sonnen was talking so much smack,\n\n2:09:14.940 --> 2:09:17.380\n maybe it was against Vanderlei Silva.\n\n2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:18.860\n I don't know, and it was one of those fights\n\n2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:20.280\n where they just didn't think he was gonna make it\n\n2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:21.120\n out of Brazil.\n\n2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:21.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:22.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:22.900 --> 2:09:24.540\n Americans don't get it.\n\n2:09:24.540 --> 2:09:25.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:25.380 --> 2:09:26.880\n People take some of that shit in different parts\n\n2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:28.620\n of the world very, very seriously.\n\n2:09:28.620 --> 2:09:30.420\n Yeah, but that's what makes it beautiful.\n\n2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:32.740\n That's what makes a great story,\n\n2:09:32.740 --> 2:09:35.620\n and I think fighting is very much about the stories,\n\n2:09:35.620 --> 2:09:39.700\n not just about the particular outcomes of a fight,\n\n2:09:39.700 --> 2:09:43.840\n or the skillset matching, or the chess of the fight.\n\n2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:47.500\n It's also about the story of the greater,\n\n2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:51.740\n like context of societies, of warring.\n\n2:09:51.740 --> 2:09:54.220\n We're like warring cultures, but we're still,\n\n2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:58.180\n we're still good, we're no longer can have great,\n\n2:09:58.180 --> 2:10:03.100\n big, hot wars between nations because of nuclear weapons.\n\n2:10:03.100 --> 2:10:05.500\n This is our wars that we can have,\n\n2:10:05.500 --> 2:10:09.540\n and in some sense, I feel robbed of the great war\n\n2:10:09.540 --> 2:10:11.020\n that could have happened.\n\n2:10:11.020 --> 2:10:13.780\n It doesn't mean there aren't lots of wars going on,\n\n2:10:13.780 --> 2:10:16.060\n but yeah, the big one is not gonna happen.\n\n2:10:16.060 --> 2:10:17.320\n There's too much of a balance of power\n\n2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:20.220\n with nuclear weapons and technology and stuff,\n\n2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:23.220\n but it's not the end of war.\n\n2:10:23.220 --> 2:10:24.220\n No.\n\n2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:27.020\n Do you think there's always gonna be war?\n\n2:10:27.020 --> 2:10:28.420\n I think there'll always be war,\n\n2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:30.820\n especially in underdeveloped parts of the world.\n\n2:10:31.780 --> 2:10:33.340\n Isn't there always underdeveloped,\n\n2:10:33.340 --> 2:10:35.420\n relatively, parts of the world?\n\n2:10:35.420 --> 2:10:37.420\n Yeah, I mean, at some point, though, you'd think,\n\n2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:40.780\n I mean, the way that technology's expanding\n\n2:10:40.780 --> 2:10:43.440\n and we're bringing technology to weird parts of the world\n\n2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:47.940\n that you wouldn't think of as technologically advanced,\n\n2:10:47.940 --> 2:10:51.500\n the way that the Chinese are inhabiting certain areas\n\n2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:54.340\n for mining purposes and things like that,\n\n2:10:54.340 --> 2:10:57.340\n I think underdeveloped parts of the world\n\n2:10:57.340 --> 2:10:59.540\n will get developed quickly.\n\n2:10:59.540 --> 2:11:02.060\n I just wonder what the nature of that war might be.\n\n2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:04.300\n It could be cyber, it could be all those kinds of things.\n\n2:11:04.300 --> 2:11:06.380\n I think in developed nations, it's gonna be cyber.\n\n2:11:06.380 --> 2:11:08.300\n I think that's probably the next phase of war,\n\n2:11:08.300 --> 2:11:10.040\n but I mean, I think you talk about parts of the world\n\n2:11:10.040 --> 2:11:10.880\n like the Middle East,\n\n2:11:10.880 --> 2:11:13.580\n and it's just still gonna be warring tribal factions.\n\n2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:15.380\n We can't even begin to understand\n\n2:11:15.380 --> 2:11:17.620\n what those people are fighting about over there.\n\n2:11:17.620 --> 2:11:20.180\n Yet, everyone sitting in America on their couch\n\n2:11:20.180 --> 2:11:21.120\n has an opinion.\n\n2:11:22.620 --> 2:11:24.280\n You can't even begin to understand it.\n\n2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:25.580\n I sure can't.\n\n2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:27.980\n Yeah, it's back to the principle discussion,\n\n2:11:29.300 --> 2:11:31.420\n when what's violated is much deeper\n\n2:11:31.420 --> 2:11:35.200\n than just kind of anything we can even,\n\n2:11:35.200 --> 2:11:38.500\n in a middle class existence, can even comprehend.\n\n2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:40.420\n A lot of times, American soldiers will go to war\n\n2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:41.700\n because that's what they're told to do,\n\n2:11:41.700 --> 2:11:43.460\n and maybe they disagree with the orders,\n\n2:11:43.460 --> 2:11:44.620\n and maybe they agree with the orders,\n\n2:11:44.620 --> 2:11:48.140\n but I get a sense that people in the Middle East fighting\n\n2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:49.920\n all believe in what they're fighting for.\n\n2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:53.060\n It's not a thing where they're told to go do it.\n\n2:11:53.060 --> 2:11:56.100\n I believe they really believe\n\n2:11:56.100 --> 2:11:57.460\n that what they're doing is the right thing,\n\n2:11:57.460 --> 2:11:59.940\n and they're defending some sort of principle.\n\n2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:03.740\n Are you generally optimistic about the future,\n\n2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:05.660\n speaking of war, of human civilization?\n\n2:12:05.660 --> 2:12:10.660\n Do you think we'll, people talk about the Fermi Paradox\n\n2:12:13.740 --> 2:12:17.020\n and asking why haven't aliens visited us,\n\n2:12:17.020 --> 2:12:19.180\n if you believe they haven't visited us.\n\n2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:25.340\n One of the thoughts is that there's kind of a great filter\n\n2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:29.220\n that intelligent civilization reach a point\n\n2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:31.180\n where it destroys itself naturally,\n\n2:12:31.180 --> 2:12:32.420\n so that's why we haven't seen them.\n\n2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:34.320\n They don't last very long.\n\n2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:36.580\n There does seem to be a kind of,\n\n2:12:37.580 --> 2:12:39.720\n we seem to be advancing faster and faster and faster.\n\n2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:41.660\n We keep developing more and more powerful ways\n\n2:12:41.660 --> 2:12:44.060\n of destroying ourselves in all kinds of ways,\n\n2:12:44.060 --> 2:12:48.820\n not even, just even to say nuclear weapons alone,\n\n2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:50.940\n but there's all kinds of new ways,\n\n2:12:50.940 --> 2:12:55.940\n engineer pandemics, nanotechnology, AGI,\n\n2:12:57.100 --> 2:12:58.400\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:03.400\n It seems to be that the argument that we are going\n\n2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:09.080\n to destroy ourselves in some kind of creative way\n\n2:13:09.080 --> 2:13:13.840\n very shortly is not too crazy of an argument to make.\n\n2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:16.840\n Are you more optimistic or pessimistic\n\n2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:18.960\n about the prospects of human civilization\n\n2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:21.400\n in maybe the 22nd century?\n\n2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:23.720\n Like, is it possible that your generation\n\n2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:26.440\n is the last generation to be alive on Earth?\n\n2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:28.920\n No, but I wouldn't say that five generations\n\n2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:31.200\n from now that could be true.\n\n2:13:32.140 --> 2:13:34.360\n I guess I think of it really selfishly.\n\n2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:38.300\n I'm a big believer that when your time here on Earth is over,\n\n2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:42.400\n the overwhelmingly vast majority of people\n\n2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.920\n will be forgotten within 12 calendar months.\n\n2:13:44.920 --> 2:13:47.840\n People with no family will be forgotten sooner,\n\n2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:49.340\n and so I don't give a lot of thought\n\n2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:52.400\n to what will happen to Earth or mankind when I'm gone.\n\n2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:55.960\n I give more thought to maximizing my time here now,\n\n2:13:55.960 --> 2:13:59.540\n and I wanna do it in a way where I don't,\n\n2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:04.640\n I'm not overtly hindering the future of civilization\n\n2:14:04.640 --> 2:14:09.140\n or humankind, but I'm definitely taking a me first approach\n\n2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:10.760\n to how I live on Earth.\n\n2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:13.500\n Do you have a philosophy behind why you have\n\n2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:16.720\n or don't have kids on this topic?\n\n2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:19.000\n Because for many people, when they have kids,\n\n2:14:20.220 --> 2:14:23.960\n there's a sense, it's almost like a genetic sense\n\n2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:26.440\n or something like that, where all of a sudden,\n\n2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:28.240\n you do start caring about what happens\n\n2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:29.540\n five generations from now.\n\n2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:32.940\n I mean, I think I'm just too selfish.\n\n2:14:34.120 --> 2:14:37.600\n I mean, I think that's the easy answer.\n\n2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:40.440\n Like, I know that your whole life has to change.\n\n2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:43.760\n You know, your focus, everything shifts,\n\n2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.960\n and just don't wanna do that.\n\n2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:48.480\n And also, I think that there's a level of,\n\n2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:51.520\n I guess if I have to really unpack it,\n\n2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:56.400\n there's probably a level of lack of hope in the future.\n\n2:14:56.400 --> 2:14:59.400\n Like, I don't think it's, I don't think the world\n\n2:14:59.400 --> 2:15:02.460\n and humanity is going in the right direction.\n\n2:15:02.460 --> 2:15:04.760\n What does the right direction look like?\n\n2:15:04.760 --> 2:15:08.520\n I think the right direction looks like people\n\n2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:13.520\n coming back together in a more impactful human way,\n\n2:15:15.040 --> 2:15:20.040\n in person, touching, feeling, talking face to face.\n\n2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:23.160\n So all the things you're describing is what we had,\n\n2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.960\n as you mentioned before, when you were like a teenager.\n\n2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:27.080\n So the state of the world.\n\n2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:29.520\n But that's because your mind was formed then.\n\n2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:31.080\n It very well could be.\n\n2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:32.040\n It very well could be.\n\n2:15:32.040 --> 2:15:34.160\n It's very possible that the virtual reality worlds\n\n2:15:34.160 --> 2:15:35.960\n that we'll create will be actually\n\n2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:37.760\n a much higher level of existence.\n\n2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.800\n In fact, like now we're getting,\n\n2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:43.280\n we're moving slowly away from tribalism,\n\n2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:46.080\n perhaps you could argue the ideas of nations,\n\n2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:49.760\n and we're going, we're moving into the realm of ideas\n\n2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:51.640\n and it could be a higher form of existence\n\n2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:56.040\n where we're sort of moving past the constraints\n\n2:15:56.040 --> 2:15:59.520\n of our meat vehicles into the space of our minds.\n\n2:15:59.520 --> 2:16:00.720\n It depends what you value.\n\n2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:02.720\n Cause when you sit here and you talk about it,\n\n2:16:02.720 --> 2:16:04.120\n and you're talking about these things\n\n2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:07.240\n in these humongous levels, on these macro levels.\n\n2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:09.080\n And I don't think a lot of people view it that way.\n\n2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:10.400\n I think a lot of people view it as like,\n\n2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:12.640\n what kind of pizza am I getting tonight?\n\n2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:14.760\n Like it's a much different outlook.\n\n2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:19.760\n And sure, the virtual world that's on the horizon,\n\n2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:22.800\n I'm sure it's got benefits and will help people,\n\n2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:25.240\n but is it gonna help the things that you find valuable?\n\n2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:26.760\n Like, was it gonna help commerce?\n\n2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:27.600\n Okay, sure.\n\n2:16:27.600 --> 2:16:29.360\n Is that the thing you find the most valuable?\n\n2:16:29.360 --> 2:16:31.240\n Is it gonna help communication?\n\n2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:33.400\n Well, it'll help disseminating information.\n\n2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:35.280\n Is it gonna help explain the information\n\n2:16:35.280 --> 2:16:36.120\n you're disseminating?\n\n2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:37.280\n Probably not.\n\n2:16:37.280 --> 2:16:39.560\n Is it gonna hinder interpersonal communication?\n\n2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:40.400\n Absolutely.\n\n2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.240\n And those are things I find valuable.\n\n2:16:42.240 --> 2:16:44.960\n Interpersonal communication, talking to people.\n\n2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:49.040\n Like it saddens me when I go into a restaurant\n\n2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:50.840\n and there's five year old kids who like,\n\n2:16:50.840 --> 2:16:53.240\n slamming away on an iPad and can't make eye contact\n\n2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:56.280\n with anybody or teenagers who don't say please and thank you\n\n2:16:56.280 --> 2:16:57.400\n when they order from the waitress.\n\n2:16:57.400 --> 2:16:59.440\n Like that to me is wrong.\n\n2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:00.640\n That shit's wrong.\n\n2:17:00.640 --> 2:17:02.480\n And I don't know this for a fact,\n\n2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:06.640\n but I do attribute that to using technology as a crutch\n\n2:17:06.640 --> 2:17:08.440\n when we're raising raising kids.\n\n2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:13.440\n So, you know, I think those are things that I find valuable.\n\n2:17:13.600 --> 2:17:14.600\n I tried to empathize.\n\n2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:16.520\n I mean, I agree with you as a person who grew up\n\n2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:19.880\n in a certain age, but like prior to the internet, I suppose.\n\n2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:25.000\n But, or at least solidified the early philosophies\n\n2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:27.720\n of the way I see the world prior to the internet.\n\n2:17:29.120 --> 2:17:31.360\n During the time of AOL, let's put it this way.\n\n2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:32.200\n Mm hmm.\n\n2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:33.040\n Uh.\n\n2:17:33.040 --> 2:17:33.880\n Brr.\n\n2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:36.680\n Uh, what was your AIMS screen name?\n\n2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:37.520\n I never had one.\n\n2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:38.360\n Okay.\n\n2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:40.840\n I was the last person I knew to get a cell phone.\n\n2:17:40.840 --> 2:17:44.320\n I was so anti all that stuff because I just felt like\n\n2:17:45.280 --> 2:17:46.520\n I didn't want to be a part of it.\n\n2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:47.640\n I did not want to be a part of it.\n\n2:17:47.640 --> 2:17:52.240\n I joined the underground forum about MMA in 2000 or 2001\n\n2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:53.720\n when I first started training.\n\n2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:57.200\n I think right at the tail end, I got a MySpace,\n\n2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:58.360\n but I didn't have any of that stuff\n\n2:17:58.360 --> 2:17:59.760\n and I didn't want any of it.\n\n2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:00.680\n I don't know why.\n\n2:18:00.680 --> 2:18:03.680\n It just was, I was not into it.\n\n2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:06.800\n I felt like, like what are the good things\n\n2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:07.720\n that are going to come out of it?\n\n2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:09.480\n Oh, I'm going to get my package in two days\n\n2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:11.200\n instead of four days?\n\n2:18:11.200 --> 2:18:12.880\n Does that make my life better?\n\n2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:15.240\n I try to, I try to deeply empathize\n\n2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:17.000\n with a lot of experiences of other people.\n\n2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:18.920\n And like one of the things I love,\n\n2:18:18.920 --> 2:18:22.240\n like the smell of paper books and books in general.\n\n2:18:22.240 --> 2:18:24.720\n And early on, this is like five years ago,\n\n2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:27.120\n I just gave away all my books.\n\n2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:30.160\n And I said, you know, I'm really going to try to\n\n2:18:30.160 --> 2:18:33.360\n fall in love with the books in the same way I did before,\n\n2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:36.440\n but now with a Kindle or not a Kindle,\n\n2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:40.400\n like paper, white, whatever, the ebook reader.\n\n2:18:40.400 --> 2:18:42.520\n And I'm still not there,\n\n2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:45.960\n but I've been kind of trying to fall in love\n\n2:18:45.960 --> 2:18:46.840\n with that experience.\n\n2:18:46.840 --> 2:18:48.880\n And the same way I try to think like,\n\n2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:50.760\n teenagers are really into TikTok now,\n\n2:18:50.760 --> 2:18:52.320\n like making these short videos.\n\n2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:56.240\n I try to consider the possibility that their existence\n\n2:18:56.240 --> 2:18:58.480\n will be a much happier one than I've had\n\n2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:01.040\n because of this kind of interaction.\n\n2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:02.920\n From my sort of skeptical perspective,\n\n2:19:02.920 --> 2:19:05.440\n it's like the attention span is so short,\n\n2:19:05.440 --> 2:19:08.880\n they don't really deeply think or deeply experience things.\n\n2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:13.480\n They construct a social layer that they present to the world\n\n2:19:13.480 --> 2:19:15.960\n and they work on creating this social layer,\n\n2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:18.800\n like the presentation to the world much more\n\n2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:20.800\n than really sitting alone with their thoughts\n\n2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:23.560\n and the sadnesses and their hopes and dreams and fears.\n\n2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:28.360\n And like working on the project that is their own,\n\n2:19:28.360 --> 2:19:31.240\n like actual person that exists in this physical world,\n\n2:19:31.240 --> 2:19:32.720\n as opposed to working on the project\n\n2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:35.800\n of a particular social platform that they show.\n\n2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:38.280\n But like, perhaps that project,\n\n2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:42.000\n like who cares who you are in the physical space?\n\n2:19:42.000 --> 2:19:46.000\n Maybe what you are is what your Instagram shows.\n\n2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:48.080\n That's the more important project to work on.\n\n2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:49.200\n Well, what's reality?\n\n2:19:49.200 --> 2:19:50.040\n Yeah, what's reality?\n\n2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:51.240\n Perception is reality, right?\n\n2:19:51.240 --> 2:19:54.720\n So how other people perceive this constructed thing,\n\n2:19:54.720 --> 2:19:56.440\n that's their reality of you.\n\n2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.560\n But is it your reality?\n\n2:19:57.560 --> 2:19:59.080\n Like that, I mean, like we said earlier,\n\n2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:03.360\n it's how you want people to see you\n\n2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:06.640\n is very rarely in line with how you really are\n\n2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.560\n or how you see yourself.\n\n2:20:08.560 --> 2:20:11.640\n And I mean, I can remember being like a 13 year old kid\n\n2:20:11.640 --> 2:20:13.720\n and like when you go through a bunch of weird\n\n2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:16.800\n 13 year old kid shit, like sitting in my room,\n\n2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:18.280\n like turning a red light on\n\n2:20:18.280 --> 2:20:20.280\n and listening to like a sad record\n\n2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:23.320\n and like trying to figure out what's going on inside.\n\n2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:25.400\n Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don't like it.\n\n2:20:25.400 --> 2:20:28.000\n But I feel like those experiences are lost\n\n2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:29.880\n on kids constantly connected to a phone.\n\n2:20:29.880 --> 2:20:32.000\n And like, you know, I don't know what the remedy\n\n2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:33.880\n for those situations is nowadays.\n\n2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:35.480\n Like, I don't know, do they make a TikTok video?\n\n2:20:35.480 --> 2:20:37.200\n Do they blog about it?\n\n2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:39.440\n Do they, you know, make a video or a...\n\n2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:40.760\n Nobody blogs anymore, bro.\n\n2:20:40.760 --> 2:20:41.840\n Whatever, man.\n\n2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:46.000\n Or a video, a story about,\n\n2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:47.400\n oh, this is what happened to me\n\n2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:48.480\n and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:50.560\n Does that actually help them work it out?\n\n2:20:50.560 --> 2:20:52.680\n Or does it just create more noise and more static\n\n2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:54.320\n on how to get to the root of the problem\n\n2:20:54.320 --> 2:20:55.800\n and learn about themselves?\n\n2:20:55.800 --> 2:20:58.520\n I don't know what future social networks are exactly.\n\n2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:00.400\n I do know on a shallow level,\n\n2:21:00.400 --> 2:21:03.120\n it does feel good when somebody clicks like on something.\n\n2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:05.080\n I think that is more of a drug\n\n2:21:05.080 --> 2:21:09.040\n than an actual deep long lasting fulfilling happiness.\n\n2:21:09.040 --> 2:21:11.120\n But perhaps there's a way to make a social network\n\n2:21:11.120 --> 2:21:14.200\n that does lead to long lasting happiness\n\n2:21:14.200 --> 2:21:18.240\n that's somehow detached from the physical meat space.\n\n2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:19.920\n I don't know, but it feels like\n\n2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:21.760\n you want to give that a chance.\n\n2:21:21.760 --> 2:21:25.920\n Do you think when people are liking things on social media,\n\n2:21:25.920 --> 2:21:27.800\n do you think there's just a group of people,\n\n2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:29.160\n an overwhelming majority of people\n\n2:21:29.160 --> 2:21:30.920\n that are gonna like whatever you put out there,\n\n2:21:30.920 --> 2:21:32.000\n they're clicking like,\n\n2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:33.480\n and then there's another section of people\n\n2:21:33.480 --> 2:21:35.440\n that just constantly scroll and like,\n\n2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:37.400\n scroll and like, and scroll and like.\n\n2:21:37.400 --> 2:21:41.480\n Like, do you think when you get a like\n\n2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:42.880\n on content you put out,\n\n2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:45.000\n that that like perhaps came from someone\n\n2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:47.200\n who normally doesn't like your content,\n\n2:21:47.200 --> 2:21:50.760\n but like you've just changed their mind on something,\n\n2:21:50.760 --> 2:21:52.720\n you've turned them around on it.\n\n2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:55.320\n I tend to think that when I get likes on social media,\n\n2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:56.840\n those are just the people that like all my shit\n\n2:21:56.840 --> 2:21:57.920\n no matter what I say.\n\n2:21:57.920 --> 2:21:59.120\n Like they probably don't even read it.\n\n2:21:59.120 --> 2:22:02.080\n Like I could put the most preposterous thing up there\n\n2:22:02.080 --> 2:22:03.120\n and you're still gonna get a handful\n\n2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:04.280\n of the same exact likes.\n\n2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:05.120\n That's interesting.\n\n2:22:05.120 --> 2:22:07.800\n But I tend to, the way I see likes,\n\n2:22:07.800 --> 2:22:10.000\n you're kind of, you said multiple things.\n\n2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.600\n I think in one sense you see social media\n\n2:22:13.600 --> 2:22:15.640\n as like a battleground of ideas\n\n2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:17.480\n and like is a kind of indicated,\n\n2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:19.520\n like the best possible like is an indicator\n\n2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:24.520\n of like, of you winning over somebody on an idea\n\n2:22:25.040 --> 2:22:26.320\n and they really appreciate that idea.\n\n2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:27.760\n That's the best possible like.\n\n2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:31.720\n To me, a like is just two strangers smiling at each other.\n\n2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:34.400\n Like a moment of like, like.\n\n2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:36.280\n I got you, bro.\n\n2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:37.280\n Yeah, I got you, bro.\n\n2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:38.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:39.200\n Yeah, like fist bump.\n\n2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:42.120\n Like, yeah, we're in this fucking thing together.\n\n2:22:42.120 --> 2:22:43.600\n This whole thing doesn't make any sense,\n\n2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:44.800\n but we're in this together.\n\n2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:48.600\n And yeah, it's possible for likes to be that.\n\n2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:51.840\n I don't think the actual clicking of a like,\n\n2:22:51.840 --> 2:22:54.560\n I think social media at its best might be that\n\n2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:56.840\n where it's like, I got you, bro.\n\n2:22:56.840 --> 2:23:00.920\n And it's a large scale as opposed to kind of\n\n2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:06.080\n this weird, like crazy pool of dopamine\n\n2:23:06.080 --> 2:23:08.960\n where everyone's just obsessed with this likes and likes\n\n2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:12.680\n and then the division drives like more\n\n2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:16.200\n of this like weird, anxious engagement.\n\n2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:18.200\n I think that's just the dark version of it\n\n2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:19.840\n in the early days of social media.\n\n2:23:19.840 --> 2:23:22.720\n I think you called it a battleground of ideas,\n\n2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:24.880\n but I think social media is nothing but a battleground\n\n2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:26.080\n of fragile egos.\n\n2:23:27.080 --> 2:23:29.880\n Well, but humans are fragile egos.\n\n2:23:29.880 --> 2:23:33.200\n I mean, maybe, but I think the people,\n\n2:23:33.200 --> 2:23:35.200\n I think particularly on social media,\n\n2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:37.360\n they're the most fragile.\n\n2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:41.680\n Like, would you be doing all the things you're doing?\n\n2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:43.640\n What would you be doing if you weren't,\n\n2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:48.640\n if you weren't podcasting and posting the things you do\n\n2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:52.520\n on social media, what would you be doing?\n\n2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:55.720\n You'd probably be much the same guy, right?\n\n2:23:55.720 --> 2:23:57.800\n But I think that on social media,\n\n2:23:57.800 --> 2:24:01.080\n the fragile ego people, what you see on social media\n\n2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:03.600\n is not what they'd be doing without social media.\n\n2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:04.440\n Does that make any sense?\n\n2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:06.200\n Like you're probably,\n\n2:24:06.200 --> 2:24:09.480\n your mission is probably somewhat congruent, your path.\n\n2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:10.960\n You're just utilizing social media.\n\n2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:12.600\n But I think a lot of people,\n\n2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:14.520\n social media has changed their path\n\n2:24:14.520 --> 2:24:19.520\n and now they're doing something totally foreign to them.\n\n2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:22.440\n And they're only able to do it maybe\n\n2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:23.520\n because of social media.\n\n2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:27.160\n I think you're focusing on a particular moment in time\n\n2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:31.560\n of people in their less great moments,\n\n2:24:31.560 --> 2:24:34.120\n like in their less great version of themselves.\n\n2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:37.080\n I think you're just focusing on the masses struggling\n\n2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:39.880\n to become the best version of themselves.\n\n2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:41.920\n And then you, yeah, sure.\n\n2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:45.640\n For stretches of time, whether it's days, weeks, and months,\n\n2:24:45.640 --> 2:24:47.640\n you could be a shady person on the internet.\n\n2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:51.520\n I think you're focusing on that.\n\n2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:56.200\n And unfortunately, social media platforms emphasize\n\n2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:58.200\n they love it when you're like that,\n\n2:24:58.200 --> 2:25:01.360\n when you're not doing great in your own life\n\n2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:04.960\n because it increases anxiety, increases engagement,\n\n2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:07.320\n makes you more susceptible to an argument,\n\n2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:09.640\n and then really get pulled into like conspiracy theories,\n\n2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:11.320\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:12.640\n But the other side works too.\n\n2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:15.360\n I think there's also the people who are on social media\n\n2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:17.520\n fronting like they're these positive figures\n\n2:25:17.520 --> 2:25:21.440\n and going to the gym, whatever it is,\n\n2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:23.280\n the positivity that they spew out.\n\n2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:24.960\n But in real life, they're the most negative fucks\n\n2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:26.040\n you've ever met in your life.\n\n2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:27.600\n And they're just so full of crap.\n\n2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:30.220\n And it's just people playing to an audience.\n\n2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:34.000\n It's like you said, it's like a politician sometimes.\n\n2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:35.840\n A politician wakes up one day and they decide,\n\n2:25:35.840 --> 2:25:38.280\n who's the group I can pander to the best\n\n2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:40.600\n to get the most likes equals votes?\n\n2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:42.080\n And it's the same thing on social media.\n\n2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:45.120\n People wake up and whether it's conscious or not,\n\n2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:47.560\n what's the group I can pander to the best\n\n2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:48.720\n to get the most likes?\n\n2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:50.840\n Is it the positivity motivated crowd?\n\n2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:52.440\n Is it the woe is me crowd?\n\n2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:53.280\n Like what is it?\n\n2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:54.760\n Who's gonna give me the most likes?\n\n2:25:54.760 --> 2:25:55.840\n That's what I'll do.\n\n2:25:57.200 --> 2:25:58.640\n I don't know how to argue against that.\n\n2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:03.600\n I guess it rings true what you're saying,\n\n2:26:03.600 --> 2:26:05.520\n but I just kind of refuse to believe it.\n\n2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:08.560\n I guess I'm pandering to the optimistic crowd.\n\n2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:10.600\n Like I met with my marketing team\n\n2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:15.600\n and I just feel that love has the best,\n\n2:26:16.780 --> 2:26:17.620\n what do you call it?\n\n2:26:17.620 --> 2:26:18.440\n No, I don't know.\n\n2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:19.560\n There's a lot of people that accuse me\n\n2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.160\n of being like exactly that,\n\n2:26:21.160 --> 2:26:22.840\n which is like, why are you always being positive?\n\n2:26:22.840 --> 2:26:26.640\n It's like, well, cause I'd like to be that.\n\n2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:30.120\n Yeah, but I wouldn't consider you someone who panders.\n\n2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:33.320\n No, but I guess what I'm saying is like,\n\n2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:38.320\n it's easy to say that everyone is pandering,\n\n2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:42.480\n but like maybe they're just trying.\n\n2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:44.840\n I do believe that social media platforms\n\n2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:46.200\n could encourage people when they're trying\n\n2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:48.320\n to be the best version of themselves, whatever that is.\n\n2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:50.600\n It could be like Conor McGregor talking shit.\n\n2:26:50.600 --> 2:26:52.160\n It could be just being positive.\n\n2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:55.360\n It could be actually creating cool things in this world,\n\n2:26:55.360 --> 2:26:57.440\n putting out instructional videos for Jiu Jitsu\n\n2:26:57.440 --> 2:26:59.840\n or like inspiring students to competition.\n\n2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:00.680\n I don't know.\n\n2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:03.280\n All those kinds of things, educational content.\n\n2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:05.040\n I think that people are trying.\n\n2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:09.560\n Like I tend to believe that people want to be good.\n\n2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:12.760\n Like they want to be successful\n\n2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:14.300\n in whatever that definition of success is.\n\n2:27:14.300 --> 2:27:15.920\n And they're kind of struggling to do that.\n\n2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:18.320\n And they're just awkward at it at first.\n\n2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:21.160\n And like, it's easy to focus on the awkwardness\n\n2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:24.000\n and the stumbling around as people have that.\n\n2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:25.480\n And they start shitting on each other.\n\n2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:27.340\n It's easy to kind of focus in on that.\n\n2:27:27.340 --> 2:27:30.760\n But I think that's just like people, you know, white belts.\n\n2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:32.000\n There's more white belts in the world\n\n2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:32.880\n than there are black belts.\n\n2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:34.920\n But you gotta give them a chance to kind of grow.\n\n2:27:34.920 --> 2:27:37.080\n I think on social media, if you put your stuff out there,\n\n2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:39.000\n whatever your stuff is, your content, your views\n\n2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.780\n or whatever, you let the chips fall where they may.\n\n2:27:41.780 --> 2:27:43.960\n Like that's a different thing than being like,\n\n2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:46.880\n I'm gonna tweak what I normally might say\n\n2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:47.720\n and put it up this way\n\n2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:50.280\n because I want these people to like it.\n\n2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:54.360\n And in terms, I also think I have a different viewpoint\n\n2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:56.760\n than you do on people wanting to be successful.\n\n2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:58.280\n I actually don't think that many people\n\n2:27:58.280 --> 2:27:59.840\n want to be successful.\n\n2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:02.100\n I think people want to have the appearance\n\n2:28:02.100 --> 2:28:04.000\n of wanting to be successful.\n\n2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.600\n But to be successful takes a shitload of work.\n\n2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:08.560\n And most people don't want to put that work in.\n\n2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:11.000\n So they craft this persona of a person\n\n2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.680\n who's trying really hard, but just can't catch the break\n\n2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:15.880\n or, you know, these motherfuckers\n\n2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:18.360\n with getting back on my grind.\n\n2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:19.680\n You've never been on a grind.\n\n2:28:19.680 --> 2:28:20.920\n You've been on the couch.\n\n2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:22.080\n I so disagree with you.\n\n2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:23.000\n I get it.\n\n2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:24.360\n I get it.\n\n2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:25.240\n That's your foil.\n\n2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:27.640\n You enjoyed that guy on the couch with the cheetah.\n\n2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:29.840\n That's your motivation.\n\n2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:30.680\n But just own it.\n\n2:28:30.680 --> 2:28:33.960\n Don't be like back on the ground, back on the couch.\n\n2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:34.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:36.720\n Well, you're like David Goggins,\n\n2:28:36.720 --> 2:28:38.200\n who was like talking shit to the one guy\n\n2:28:38.200 --> 2:28:39.160\n with the eating Cheetos.\n\n2:28:39.160 --> 2:28:42.260\n And so doing inspires millions\n\n2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:44.660\n to actually pursue their success.\n\n2:28:44.660 --> 2:28:45.500\n I get it.\n\n2:28:45.500 --> 2:28:46.560\n But I just think that most people\n\n2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:48.880\n really do want to be successful\n\n2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:53.000\n and are trying to work hard and they keep failing.\n\n2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.120\n So, I mean.\n\n2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:55.920\n But why is it continue?\n\n2:28:55.920 --> 2:28:57.040\n I'm sorry to interrupt you.\n\n2:28:57.040 --> 2:28:59.320\n But like, let's take a person who's overweight.\n\n2:28:59.320 --> 2:29:01.440\n Do you not think that person wants to be skinny?\n\n2:29:01.440 --> 2:29:02.960\n Of course they want to be skinny.\n\n2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:04.800\n They just don't want it enough\n\n2:29:04.800 --> 2:29:07.680\n to put the pizza or the pie down and go to the gym.\n\n2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:10.180\n They want it, but they want it to be easy.\n\n2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:11.720\n Of course they want to be skinny.\n\n2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:13.120\n Well, everyone wants it to be easy.\n\n2:29:13.120 --> 2:29:13.960\n Right.\n\n2:29:13.960 --> 2:29:16.120\n And of course people want to be successful,\n\n2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:18.640\n but do they want it enough to do the work?\n\n2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:19.960\n I don't think they do.\n\n2:29:19.960 --> 2:29:22.920\n I think the easy thing to do is to create\n\n2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:28.800\n an outward facing persona of the person who really wants it.\n\n2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:32.840\n And you get the same reward from a lot of people\n\n2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:35.200\n as the person who actually is successful.\n\n2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:36.720\n Very few people differentiate\n\n2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:38.480\n from the person who's found success\n\n2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:40.480\n and the person who's showing you\n\n2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:43.120\n how they're trying to get success on social media.\n\n2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:44.960\n People see that as the same.\n\n2:29:44.960 --> 2:29:47.800\n I see you're going after the marketing dollar\n\n2:29:47.800 --> 2:29:50.480\n that represents the people that want to work hard.\n\n2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:51.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:52.640\n I like it.\n\n2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:57.680\n You started a podcast recently.\n\n2:29:57.680 --> 2:29:58.520\n Hell yeah.\n\n2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:02.480\n It's called, which people probably from this conversation\n\n2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:05.120\n can, I guess we didn't really talk about politics much\n\n2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:06.480\n or the fact that you're a business owner\n\n2:30:06.480 --> 2:30:08.960\n or the fact that you're a red blooded American\n\n2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:12.680\n and love this country, America.\n\n2:30:12.680 --> 2:30:14.060\n We didn't really talk about that,\n\n2:30:14.060 --> 2:30:15.640\n but from the name of the podcast,\n\n2:30:15.640 --> 2:30:16.760\n they can probably infer it.\n\n2:30:16.760 --> 2:30:20.580\n And the name is Please Allow Me.\n\n2:30:20.580 --> 2:30:21.420\n Good name.\n\n2:30:24.220 --> 2:30:27.660\n What have you learned from doing this podcast?\n\n2:30:27.660 --> 2:30:30.440\n What's your hope of doing this podcast?\n\n2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:31.680\n People should definitely listen to it.\n\n2:30:31.680 --> 2:30:32.920\n You have a few episodes out.\n\n2:30:32.920 --> 2:30:36.360\n You're damn good at it, which is very interesting.\n\n2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:38.840\n I'm sure you'll evolve and change.\n\n2:30:38.840 --> 2:30:40.160\n So this is like the early days.\n\n2:30:40.160 --> 2:30:41.920\n I'm curious to see where it goes,\n\n2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:44.760\n but what's your thinking around it\n\n2:30:44.760 --> 2:30:48.880\n as an intellectual putting your thoughts out into the world?\n\n2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:52.360\n I think that one of the things that COVID did\n\n2:30:52.360 --> 2:30:56.120\n when we're all kind of in lockdown was as a business owner,\n\n2:30:56.120 --> 2:30:57.880\n made me take stock of what's the future\n\n2:30:57.880 --> 2:30:59.200\n of brick and mortar businesses.\n\n2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:01.920\n And I've always been reluctant\n\n2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:04.500\n to be an online presence in any way,\n\n2:31:04.500 --> 2:31:05.640\n just because it's not my thing,\n\n2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:07.240\n because I believe that I'm a force of nature\n\n2:31:07.240 --> 2:31:10.360\n and people need to experience me, right?\n\n2:31:10.360 --> 2:31:13.600\n And the few characters that Twitter has are phasing.\n\n2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:14.440\n It's not enough to experience.\n\n2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:15.280\n It's not enough.\n\n2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:17.080\n The force of nature, there's John Clark.\n\n2:31:17.080 --> 2:31:19.880\n I want you to feel physically uncomfortable around me.\n\n2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:21.220\n This has been three hours\n\n2:31:21.220 --> 2:31:23.440\n of me being physically uncomfortable.\n\n2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:25.160\n I'm scared for my life.\n\n2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:27.560\n And so I thought that that would be one of the ways\n\n2:31:27.560 --> 2:31:29.200\n in which I could increase.\n\n2:31:29.200 --> 2:31:33.240\n I came to the conclusion that with the lockdown\n\n2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:34.760\n and potential future lockdowns,\n\n2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:39.960\n in order to pay my mortgage and my bar tab\n\n2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:42.240\n and my Grubhub's out of control,\n\n2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:45.480\n that I would need to find ancillary ways to...\n\n2:31:45.480 --> 2:31:47.520\n Door dash slash Lex.\n\n2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:49.820\n You don't want to use Grubhub, Grubhub sucks.\n\n2:31:49.820 --> 2:31:50.660\n Door dash.\n\n2:31:50.660 --> 2:31:51.480\n They actually do.\n\n2:31:51.480 --> 2:31:52.320\n Door dash.\n\n2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:53.140\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n2:31:53.140 --> 2:31:55.320\n You can go back to your local fooder.\n\n2:31:55.320 --> 2:31:56.160\n 711.\n\n2:31:56.160 --> 2:31:57.560\n Yeah, and get the food.\n\n2:31:57.560 --> 2:31:59.600\n You can order 711 from Door Dash.\n\n2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:00.600\n Or from Postmates.\n\n2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:01.540\n Code Lex.\n\n2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:04.520\n Okay, I'm sorry, go.\n\n2:32:04.520 --> 2:32:05.560\n But anyway, I thought it was like,\n\n2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:07.440\n oh, I should probably increase a little bit\n\n2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:12.160\n my online presence and what would be a way to do that\n\n2:32:12.160 --> 2:32:14.960\n that would be fun for me and entertaining.\n\n2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:18.720\n And I thought, well, a lot of people, yourself included,\n\n2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:20.520\n that I know have done some podcasts\n\n2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:24.440\n and I find that inspiring and I'm fortunate enough\n\n2:32:24.440 --> 2:32:25.920\n to know a bunch of cool motherfuckers\n\n2:32:25.920 --> 2:32:30.920\n that I can talk to about a wide range of topics.\n\n2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:32.440\n Then they're starting to drop in.\n\n2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:34.000\n There's an aspect to which podcasting\n\n2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.600\n does capture the force of nature better.\n\n2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:39.280\n In the digital form, podcasting captures\n\n2:32:39.280 --> 2:32:40.860\n the force of nature of a human being\n\n2:32:40.860 --> 2:32:42.440\n better than other mediums, perhaps.\n\n2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:43.800\n Yeah, definitely, there's that.\n\n2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:48.560\n I just felt like, you know when it's midnight\n\n2:32:48.560 --> 2:32:51.720\n and you're in the bar and you get the sense\n\n2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:53.760\n that the bar's gonna close in 90 minutes\n\n2:32:53.760 --> 2:32:57.000\n and you think, you know, not enough people have seen me yet\n\n2:32:57.000 --> 2:32:58.220\n and maybe we should go to another bar\n\n2:32:58.220 --> 2:33:00.040\n so more people can see me.\n\n2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:03.720\n I feel like podcasting is like that for me.\n\n2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:05.680\n Not enough people have heard my thoughts\n\n2:33:05.680 --> 2:33:08.800\n and I feel like, my mom raised me to be a giver.\n\n2:33:08.800 --> 2:33:10.800\n She didn't want me to be selfish.\n\n2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:15.120\n And I have these thoughts that I think.\n\n2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:17.000\n It'd be a waste if you didn't give it to the world.\n\n2:33:17.000 --> 2:33:18.600\n People seem to really enjoy them.\n\n2:33:18.600 --> 2:33:20.760\n Yeah, no, I enjoy them.\n\n2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:23.360\n While I've probably been on my best behavior today\n\n2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:25.720\n on this episode of the podcast.\n\n2:33:25.720 --> 2:33:29.840\n So if you want the uncensored, unfiltered,\n\n2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:31.920\n the full spectrum of the force of nature,\n\n2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:35.680\n there's John Clark, you go to the podcast.\n\n2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:37.960\n Funny enough, I think you're drinking\n\n2:33:37.960 --> 2:33:39.440\n throughout most of the podcast.\n\n2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:40.440\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:42.960\n Tequila, so they only last like an hour\n\n2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:45.040\n because you seem to like, I'm guessing\n\n2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:47.160\n that you just lose it one hour.\n\n2:33:47.160 --> 2:33:50.360\n Like it's like Cinderella turns into a frog or whatever.\n\n2:33:50.360 --> 2:33:52.640\n One of the things I'm learning is\n\n2:33:54.880 --> 2:33:57.680\n sometimes you have great conversations when you're drunk\n\n2:33:57.680 --> 2:33:58.600\n and sometimes you don't.\n\n2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:01.240\n Like I went into it with the write drunk,\n\n2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:02.620\n edit sober mentality.\n\n2:34:03.760 --> 2:34:05.120\n Yes, Hemingway.\n\n2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:06.360\n Hemingway, yes.\n\n2:34:06.360 --> 2:34:10.800\n But turns out that sometimes you don't have that much\n\n2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:13.120\n to edit when you're super shit faced.\n\n2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:17.120\n And so I've been scaling that back a little bit.\n\n2:34:17.120 --> 2:34:18.440\n What do you mean exactly by that?\n\n2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:20.440\n Like, where does it go wrong when you're drunk?\n\n2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:22.840\n I'm curious about that, because.\n\n2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:26.180\n It gets, especially when you have a personal relationship\n\n2:34:26.180 --> 2:34:27.780\n with the person that you're talking to,\n\n2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:29.860\n rather than trying to put some ideas on display\n\n2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:32.000\n for other people to hear and maybe talk about,\n\n2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.760\n you wind up just having like a conversation\n\n2:34:33.760 --> 2:34:36.040\n with your bro about inside jokes and things like that.\n\n2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:37.760\n And it's like, it's not that interesting.\n\n2:34:37.760 --> 2:34:40.240\n No one wants to like watch, you know,\n\n2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:42.360\n go to a bar and watch two people at the,\n\n2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:44.360\n sitting there getting drunk and talking to each other\n\n2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:48.480\n is different than listening to like strong discourse.\n\n2:34:48.480 --> 2:34:49.320\n Yes.\n\n2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:51.440\n One interesting thing as a fan of Joe Rogan,\n\n2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:53.520\n I'm a fan, I've been a fan of Joe Rogan for a long time\n\n2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:56.200\n and he has his friends over a lot, right?\n\n2:34:56.200 --> 2:34:59.000\n And there's a aspect to those three, four,\n\n2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:00.760\n five hour conversations that I really enjoy.\n\n2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:02.360\n There's a magic to those.\n\n2:35:02.360 --> 2:35:03.880\n I think he taught the world that those kinds\n\n2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:06.240\n of long form conversations can work.\n\n2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:10.640\n The, what you forget is Joe Rogan is a comedian.\n\n2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:12.400\n His friends are also celebrities.\n\n2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:14.800\n Like they know what it's like to be on the mic.\n\n2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:17.280\n They know there is a challenge\n\n2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:20.240\n to actually having your friends on a microphone.\n\n2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:21.080\n Totally.\n\n2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:22.040\n Like they've never,\n\n2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:24.040\n this is the first time they've been on a microphone.\n\n2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:25.520\n And that's actually what you've been doing,\n\n2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.000\n which is a very interesting experiment.\n\n2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.880\n And you find that some are more awkward than others.\n\n2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:33.520\n Like they're trying to find like,\n\n2:35:33.520 --> 2:35:35.180\n what do I do with this kind of thing?\n\n2:35:35.180 --> 2:35:37.720\n Why do you not talk to strangers?\n\n2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:41.480\n Why did you go with people that you're actually know?\n\n2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:43.160\n So the simple answer is the people\n\n2:35:43.160 --> 2:35:44.880\n that I selected are both interesting\n\n2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:46.640\n and I thought would be good at talking.\n\n2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:48.760\n But then I noticed the thing you just mentioned.\n\n2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:51.560\n My buddy Paul did the first one and Paul's a wild man.\n\n2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:52.880\n And if you went out with Paul,\n\n2:35:52.880 --> 2:35:56.040\n he can talk about a bazillion topics\n\n2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:00.200\n to a certain, to a significant level of depth, right?\n\n2:36:00.200 --> 2:36:01.200\n And he's got a good understanding\n\n2:36:01.200 --> 2:36:03.800\n and he's got a unique perspective on a lot of things.\n\n2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:08.800\n And I think he was the first guy invited on my podcast\n\n2:36:10.920 --> 2:36:15.200\n and it was almost like he was on a little bit\n\n2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:16.880\n less than natural about it.\n\n2:36:16.880 --> 2:36:19.120\n And then by the time he loosened up with some drinks,\n\n2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:22.520\n he was, it just, we were all shitfaced.\n\n2:36:22.520 --> 2:36:24.080\n There's a face shift though.\n\n2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:25.440\n Totally, totally.\n\n2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:27.760\n And so he's gonna come back on\n\n2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:29.240\n and he'll be more comfortable with it.\n\n2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:31.000\n And it'll probably be awesome\n\n2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.480\n because he's a great person to talk to.\n\n2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:35.400\n I had my friend Dave on who's a restaurateur\n\n2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:39.280\n and a musician, that one will be released pretty soon.\n\n2:36:39.280 --> 2:36:40.760\n But yesterday I had a guy on\n\n2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:42.440\n who you might really enjoy listening to\n\n2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:44.640\n who's a friend of mine, his name's Mark Clem.\n\n2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:48.480\n He's an endurance athlete and he's been compared,\n\n2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:51.080\n he's been called the white Dave Goggins.\n\n2:36:51.080 --> 2:36:53.880\n And he talks about like those comparisons\n\n2:36:53.880 --> 2:36:56.960\n and what he hates about it and the various events and stuff.\n\n2:36:56.960 --> 2:36:59.520\n And he's just a guy who's just always kind of like natural\n\n2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:01.880\n and like, I knew he'd be great to get on the podcast.\n\n2:37:01.880 --> 2:37:06.880\n And so I started with friends who I thought could handle it\n\n2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:10.480\n and who also are just really interesting people.\n\n2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:13.960\n And I did it so that I could also establish\n\n2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:16.520\n a level of comfort because it was a new thing for me.\n\n2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:18.240\n And I knew that they wouldn't really give a shit\n\n2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.080\n what I was doing and be like, hey, this is cool.\n\n2:37:20.080 --> 2:37:21.120\n I'm going over to JC's house.\n\n2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:22.680\n We're gonna drink some tequila and talk shit.\n\n2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:24.640\n There's just gonna be a microphone there this time.\n\n2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:26.480\n I mean, it's amazing what you're doing, the freedom of it.\n\n2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:28.560\n I mean, you're not currently doing any advertisements\n\n2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:29.440\n or any of that kind of stuff.\n\n2:37:29.440 --> 2:37:30.480\n You're just exploring your voice.\n\n2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:32.920\n This is one of the mediums that you're just trying it out.\n\n2:37:32.920 --> 2:37:34.800\n My 11 subscribers know what I'm about.\n\n2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:38.040\n Your 11 subscribers, it's in the double digits.\n\n2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:43.520\n For both you and I, do you have advice for me\n\n2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:46.600\n as a podcaster and for yourself as a podcast?\n\n2:37:46.600 --> 2:37:49.480\n Like if you were to think like you're gonna do say,\n\n2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:53.560\n I mean, who knows, but say you do a thousand more episodes.\n\n2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:58.180\n Like imagine a world where your life continues\n\n2:37:58.180 --> 2:38:01.160\n in that direction, that this is like a little parallel.\n\n2:38:01.160 --> 2:38:03.440\n Like for me, this thing is like a little side hobby,\n\n2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:06.080\n but it's also one that's deeply fulfilling.\n\n2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:09.080\n So not just from a business perspective,\n\n2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:10.480\n which is not the way I think about it.\n\n2:38:10.480 --> 2:38:13.000\n I just think from a life human perspective,\n\n2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:16.200\n it's I probably wouldn't have this kind of conversation\n\n2:38:16.200 --> 2:38:20.900\n with you off mic, like this long, this deep, this attentive.\n\n2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:22.300\n There's something really fulfilling\n\n2:38:22.300 --> 2:38:23.640\n about these conversations.\n\n2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:26.380\n So what advice would you have for me?\n\n2:38:26.380 --> 2:38:28.040\n What advice do you have for yourself?\n\n2:38:28.040 --> 2:38:31.000\n Oh, have you not introspected this that deeply?\n\n2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:32.480\n Oh, I have advice.\n\n2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:34.320\n I think the first advice I would give to you\n\n2:38:34.320 --> 2:38:37.160\n is I think you should have me on more often.\n\n2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:38.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:39.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:39.760 --> 2:38:41.120\n That's first and foremost.\n\n2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:43.920\n And second is go on your podcast and have a conversation.\n\n2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:48.920\n Well, I would say you come on my podcast when you're ready.\n\n2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:49.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:52.920\n When you feel like the product that I'm putting out\n\n2:38:54.040 --> 2:38:57.000\n would benefit from your presence and vice versa,\n\n2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:01.680\n not as a favor to a bro, but at the right time.\n\n2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:04.160\n I do sense, actually, it's an interesting,\n\n2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:07.800\n there's a dance to it, which is like Joe Rogan,\n\n2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:12.120\n I recently did, like Joe Rogan had a conversation with me\n\n2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:13.740\n on this podcast.\n\n2:39:13.740 --> 2:39:16.080\n There's a very specific kind of thing\n\n2:39:16.080 --> 2:39:19.560\n where you're helping each other out.\n\n2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:20.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:20.400 --> 2:39:22.300\n But the timing on that has to be right.\n\n2:39:22.300 --> 2:39:23.140\n Right.\n\n2:39:23.140 --> 2:39:24.880\n You know, like if that makes any sense,\n\n2:39:24.880 --> 2:39:26.480\n you're like supporting each other.\n\n2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:27.640\n It doesn't make sense.\n\n2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:30.680\n It doesn't make a difference, you would think.\n\n2:39:30.680 --> 2:39:31.520\n Right.\n\n2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:32.760\n Because it's just people talking,\n\n2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:34.160\n it doesn't matter what microphones,\n\n2:39:34.160 --> 2:39:35.300\n but it changes things.\n\n2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:36.900\n It does, and there's an order to the guests\n\n2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:38.120\n that I've had on.\n\n2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:39.700\n And the next guest that I'll have on\n\n2:39:39.700 --> 2:39:42.640\n will be a friend we have in common,\n\n2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:44.200\n and we'll be talking about teaching\n\n2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:45.960\n and how to teach different styles of teaching\n\n2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:47.520\n and what you're teaching and all these other things.\n\n2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:48.640\n Your mind's saying who?\n\n2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:49.840\n Oh, Sean Fisher.\n\n2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:53.120\n And I think there's an order to,\n\n2:39:53.120 --> 2:39:56.760\n it's not scientific, but it's based on my gut.\n\n2:39:56.760 --> 2:39:58.920\n Is it astrologically based?\n\n2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:02.520\n What do you mean it's not scientific?\n\n2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:05.440\n Your gut, so you have a sense,\n\n2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.560\n like Joe Rogan, for example, tries to do left, right.\n\n2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:12.440\n He tries to alternate like this gut feeling\n\n2:40:12.440 --> 2:40:14.480\n of like these bins of people,\n\n2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:17.440\n and he tries to alternate worldviews.\n\n2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:18.280\n That's interesting.\n\n2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:21.120\n Like he kind of, so that he doesn't feel like it,\n\n2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:25.040\n like it constantly shakes him.\n\n2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:26.400\n It's more about him,\n\n2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:28.800\n like constantly pulls him in multiple directions\n\n2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:31.240\n about like how he sees the world,\n\n2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:32.760\n and that keeps him balanced.\n\n2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:34.600\n That keeps the conversation kind of exciting.\n\n2:40:34.600 --> 2:40:35.440\n That's interesting.\n\n2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:39.240\n I did it in a way where I knew Paul was gonna be wild\n\n2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:40.640\n and we might get a little out of control\n\n2:40:40.640 --> 2:40:43.640\n and like have some technical hiccups along the way.\n\n2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:44.600\n And then my friend Jake,\n\n2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:47.020\n who's a CEO of a pharmaceutical company,\n\n2:40:47.020 --> 2:40:49.360\n that was very timely because he was able\n\n2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:50.720\n to speak to vaccines.\n\n2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:52.600\n And that was kind of scientific flavored.\n\n2:40:52.600 --> 2:40:53.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:55.600\n And what I learned listening back on that\n\n2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:57.960\n is like I learned for myself about,\n\n2:40:58.920 --> 2:41:02.120\n I wasn't asking the next level questions\n\n2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:04.320\n to really draw out great answers.\n\n2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:09.320\n And part of it is you're simultaneously hanging out\n\n2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:11.240\n with a bro, but also I was trying to learn something\n\n2:41:11.240 --> 2:41:12.920\n and I didn't learn what I wanted to learn.\n\n2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:15.600\n And that's my fault because I didn't ask the questions.\n\n2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:17.280\n He's an expert in that field.\n\n2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:19.680\n He doesn't know that I'm an absolute dipshit\n\n2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:20.920\n when it comes to that stuff.\n\n2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:22.040\n And so I didn't do a good job.\n\n2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:22.880\n And if I don't know it,\n\n2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:25.040\n that means the thing I was trying to tease out of him,\n\n2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:27.960\n no one who was gonna listen is gonna learn that either.\n\n2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:28.960\n So I learned that.\n\n2:41:30.400 --> 2:41:31.800\n Then I had the one with soap on,\n\n2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:34.800\n which I thought was pretty good.\n\n2:41:34.800 --> 2:41:36.880\n He's a wrestler, he's also a farmer.\n\n2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:38.600\n Right, and a social worker.\n\n2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.720\n And kind of humble and thoughtful.\n\n2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:41.560\n Yeah, thoughtful.\n\n2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:42.480\n Thoughtful guy.\n\n2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:45.160\n Like slower, he's not a wild man, that kind of thing.\n\n2:41:45.160 --> 2:41:46.960\n Not a wild man in the sense that I'm wild,\n\n2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:51.080\n but he does preach this philosophy of being more wild.\n\n2:41:51.080 --> 2:41:52.960\n Like being in touch with nature.\n\n2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:54.800\n Nature, that kind of wild.\n\n2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:55.640\n Right, right, right.\n\n2:41:55.640 --> 2:42:00.640\n And then my buddy Dave, he came on because I love music.\n\n2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:03.240\n And I wanted to talk a lot about music.\n\n2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:05.200\n And he's one of the most knowledgeable people\n\n2:42:05.200 --> 2:42:06.400\n about music that I know.\n\n2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:07.600\n And he's got a restaurant coming up.\n\n2:42:07.600 --> 2:42:11.160\n And I thought my buddy Mark Clem,\n\n2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:12.360\n being an endurance athlete,\n\n2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:13.480\n like when you hear some of the things,\n\n2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:14.920\n I didn't even know these things existed\n\n2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:16.240\n that this fucking kid did.\n\n2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:17.760\n He's out of his mind.\n\n2:42:17.760 --> 2:42:19.760\n And I think Sean and I will have\n\n2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:21.760\n probably the most intellectual conversation\n\n2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:24.200\n that I'll have had on my podcast to date.\n\n2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:26.560\n And so there's a little bit of alternating there,\n\n2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:31.560\n but I did it that way so that.\n\n2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:34.760\n There's a gut feeling behind, oh, so that what?\n\n2:42:34.760 --> 2:42:36.600\n Is there, where are you going?\n\n2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:38.040\n Do you know where you're going?\n\n2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:42.160\n I don't have a destination, but I want to,\n\n2:42:42.160 --> 2:42:47.160\n I want to see it to its end, whether that's,\n\n2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:51.600\n it gets somewhere of its own volition\n\n2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:53.760\n or it takes on a new life at some point.\n\n2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:56.360\n And then I know how to drive it where it needs to go.\n\n2:42:57.760 --> 2:43:02.680\n I think the advice I have for both of us is,\n\n2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:09.920\n I think I need to, no, I don't think so.\n\n2:43:09.920 --> 2:43:12.960\n I think for you, I see an inner turmoil.\n\n2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:14.880\n I see a storm that bruising you\n\n2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:17.720\n because I feel like there's a concern\n\n2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:18.880\n for what you're saying.\n\n2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:23.880\n And is it gonna lead to negative feelings towards you\n\n2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:29.400\n or the thing that you're doing?\n\n2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:33.760\n And I feel like we're different people\n\n2:43:33.760 --> 2:43:37.320\n and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody.\n\n2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:40.000\n And that's a liberating thing,\n\n2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:43.440\n but it also can keep me from achieving the thing\n\n2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:44.960\n that I want to achieve,\n\n2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:48.280\n because I'm so flippant with opinions\n\n2:43:48.280 --> 2:43:49.480\n that I don't listen to them\n\n2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:51.120\n and let them direct me when they should.\n\n2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:52.240\n There's a balance.\n\n2:43:53.400 --> 2:43:54.560\n Let me push back on that.\n\n2:43:54.560 --> 2:43:55.400\n Please do.\n\n2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:57.600\n I think you believe that about yourself\n\n2:43:57.600 --> 2:43:59.800\n and nevertheless, your social media presence\n\n2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:01.000\n indicates otherwise.\n\n2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:02.640\n If I were to be very harsh,\n\n2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:05.600\n you're like one of the mentally strongest\n\n2:44:05.600 --> 2:44:07.280\n character wise people I know.\n\n2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:09.000\n And yet on social media,\n\n2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.640\n you don't put your face to the world.\n\n2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:15.480\n So one of the reasons you sense the fear in me,\n\n2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:18.800\n which exists, I of course want to let go of it,\n\n2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:23.200\n is because I put my face and my name on things.\n\n2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:26.160\n And so when I say something stupid,\n\n2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:29.760\n it hurts when people say like,\n\n2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:32.040\n look, that guy said something stupid.\n\n2:44:32.040 --> 2:44:34.120\n And so there's a fear of saying something stupid\n\n2:44:34.120 --> 2:44:36.520\n in all of his different forms,\n\n2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:38.280\n like of being my lesser self.\n\n2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:40.040\n It's the same feeling I have in competition\n\n2:44:40.040 --> 2:44:42.520\n of losing, not just losing.\n\n2:44:42.520 --> 2:44:43.480\n Losing doesn't matter.\n\n2:44:43.480 --> 2:44:45.920\n It's embarrassing myself.\n\n2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:48.960\n I like losing, being the lesser version of myself.\n\n2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:50.760\n And when you put yourself out there in a full way,\n\n2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:51.600\n I think you,\n\n2:44:52.560 --> 2:44:54.800\n I would venture to say you're also,\n\n2:44:54.800 --> 2:44:58.240\n because you said you wouldn't give yourself that advice.\n\n2:44:58.240 --> 2:44:59.720\n I feel like you're also afraid\n\n2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:01.520\n of standing behind some of the ideas,\n\n2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:03.320\n because right now you're doing guerrilla warfare.\n\n2:45:03.320 --> 2:45:07.080\n You're free to be,\n\n2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:11.600\n to say things, to speak your mind from the sidelines.\n\n2:45:11.600 --> 2:45:13.360\n But the moment you're standing,\n\n2:45:13.360 --> 2:45:16.120\n and when people can throw shit at you,\n\n2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:19.520\n I feel like you haven't faced that fire yet.\n\n2:45:19.520 --> 2:45:20.840\n You've been avoiding that fire.\n\n2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:22.840\n I'm not sure, maybe I'm projecting.\n\n2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:24.320\n No, to a degree you're right.\n\n2:45:24.320 --> 2:45:27.960\n I think a big thing for me was putting ads on\n\n2:45:27.960 --> 2:45:32.920\n for our Jiu Jitsu online curriculum.\n\n2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:34.840\n That was a big thing for me,\n\n2:45:34.840 --> 2:45:36.960\n because for several reasons,\n\n2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:39.480\n like in the climate of everyone under the sun\n\n2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:44.120\n having a Jiu Jitsu tutorial online and social media,\n\n2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:45.280\n not social media necessarily,\n\n2:45:45.280 --> 2:45:49.520\n but forums specifically that critique and shit the bed.\n\n2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:51.760\n One thing I have not done that I've thought about doing,\n\n2:45:51.760 --> 2:45:54.440\n and probably you're right in your analysis of it,\n\n2:45:54.440 --> 2:45:56.920\n is I've not gone the way that I do see you\n\n2:45:56.920 --> 2:45:58.560\n on things like Reddit and say,\n\n2:45:58.560 --> 2:46:00.200\n hey, Reddit, I'm doing this.\n\n2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:01.720\n Like I could easily go to Reddit and say,\n\n2:46:01.720 --> 2:46:04.440\n hey, Reddit, I got this website up.\n\n2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:05.640\n Here's a sample video,\n\n2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:07.000\n whatever the fuck people do on there.\n\n2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:08.520\n But yeah, you're right, I haven't done that.\n\n2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:13.520\n And part of it might be because I know also,\n\n2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:18.760\n if I get suckered in for one second into the negativity,\n\n2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:20.560\n I'm gonna become an online warrior,\n\n2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:22.400\n and I don't wanna be that person.\n\n2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:23.240\n So yeah, you're probably right.\n\n2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:25.120\n So you're self aware about that.\n\n2:46:25.120 --> 2:46:27.720\n I mean, one of the things I've early on decided\n\n2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:30.920\n is like, I'm just gonna be,\n\n2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:32.920\n I've always really enjoyed being positive.\n\n2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:35.760\n So I'm going to make sure I stay that way.\n\n2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:37.800\n And when there's negativity, it's like,\n\n2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:40.320\n I'm not just ignoring it.\n\n2:46:40.320 --> 2:46:42.840\n I'm literally just returning it with positivity.\n\n2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:45.800\n I probably am the same way as you,\n\n2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:49.040\n most people are with egos.\n\n2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:51.200\n You wanna become the warrior against the negativity.\n\n2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:56.040\n And like many wars, there's no winning.\n\n2:46:56.040 --> 2:46:57.360\n There's no winning that war.\n\n2:46:57.360 --> 2:46:58.200\n Especially online.\n\n2:46:58.200 --> 2:46:59.120\n Especially on the internet.\n\n2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:02.520\n And so in that sense, that's been a journey\n\n2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:07.520\n to try to face the fire of the negativity.\n\n2:47:07.520 --> 2:47:08.760\n And it's not actually that bad.\n\n2:47:08.760 --> 2:47:09.960\n It sounds like very dramatic.\n\n2:47:09.960 --> 2:47:11.600\n There's not many people that are negative,\n\n2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:14.000\n but it's like when you put advertisements,\n\n2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:15.920\n so you put your face on an instructional\n\n2:47:15.920 --> 2:47:17.440\n or something like that.\n\n2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:19.360\n It just, there's an aspect to it\n\n2:47:19.360 --> 2:47:20.720\n which you're being a salesman,\n\n2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:23.400\n you're being a gimmicky thing.\n\n2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:24.960\n It just feels wrong.\n\n2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:26.440\n And people will point out, look,\n\n2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:28.000\n that guy is a fraud, like it's fake.\n\n2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:29.320\n Look, he's trying,\n\n2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:31.200\n but those people are going to be out there.\n\n2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:33.520\n And if you're like trying to do your best,\n\n2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:36.480\n trying to be authentic and not trying to like\n\n2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:40.680\n be a snake oil salesman\n\n2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:43.080\n and being like the shady kind of salesman,\n\n2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:46.320\n I think they keep you honest.\n\n2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.160\n They keep you honestly being the most authentic self.\n\n2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.360\n And podcasting is like the best medium\n\n2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:53.360\n because you're being real.\n\n2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:56.760\n Those one hour plus that you put out there,\n\n2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:58.680\n that's like real John.\n\n2:47:58.680 --> 2:47:59.560\n That's not a,\n\n2:48:01.520 --> 2:48:04.040\n like people fall in love with that.\n\n2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:06.480\n And that's the beautiful aspect of podcasting\n\n2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:08.160\n is there's no,\n\n2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:12.320\n long form doesn't give any possibility\n\n2:48:12.320 --> 2:48:13.840\n for you not to be authentic.\n\n2:48:14.920 --> 2:48:17.080\n And that's why it's a magical medium.\n\n2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:21.120\n The tough thing is you're not,\n\n2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:25.000\n popularity takes time, not popularity.\n\n2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:27.840\n And so like you shouldn't be doing it for that reason.\n\n2:48:27.840 --> 2:48:29.480\n And I don't,\n\n2:48:29.480 --> 2:48:33.640\n it's not the thing that really drives me.\n\n2:48:33.640 --> 2:48:34.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:35.880\n Is there three books,\n\n2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:38.440\n technical fiction philosophical that had an impact on you?\n\n2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:40.240\n Like, is there books that you kind of return to\n\n2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:44.840\n that you enjoy and that you find profound in some way?\n\n2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:46.920\n I would say like probably the thing I read\n\n2:48:46.920 --> 2:48:49.160\n is in one of Emerson's essays that I read\n\n2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:52.880\n at a point in my life where I needed that type of thing.\n\n2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:55.320\n And I read self reliance and,\n\n2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:56.440\n he's got a ton of good essays,\n\n2:48:56.440 --> 2:48:58.120\n but I thought self reliance was probably\n\n2:48:58.120 --> 2:48:59.840\n the most impactful to me.\n\n2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:03.120\n I've read later in life,\n\n2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:07.400\n like a handful of existential authors\n\n2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:09.000\n and they're all great,\n\n2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.120\n but at the time a lot of it has to do with timing.\n\n2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:14.000\n And when I read self reliance\n\n2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:17.360\n and it was about the individual that was really good\n\n2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:19.800\n and made it was impactful.\n\n2:49:19.800 --> 2:49:22.680\n There's also a book called Jonathan Livingston Seagull\n\n2:49:22.680 --> 2:49:25.240\n by Richard Bach, I think.\n\n2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:27.840\n And it's kind of along the same lines.\n\n2:49:27.840 --> 2:49:30.960\n It's about this seagull who wants to break conformity\n\n2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:33.520\n and learn to fly and do all these other great things.\n\n2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:35.360\n And so it's a very short read.\n\n2:49:35.360 --> 2:49:37.480\n So if people are interested in that, that's good.\n\n2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:42.240\n The book, which I was lucky enough to read\n\n2:49:42.240 --> 2:49:44.160\n before the movie ever even came out,\n\n2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:47.920\n which is just a pleasure of mine was American Psycho.\n\n2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:49.600\n Just from a writing standpoint,\n\n2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:52.760\n I found that the writing was awesome.\n\n2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:54.360\n Brett Easton Ellis is the author of that\n\n2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:55.280\n and several other books\n\n2:49:55.280 --> 2:49:57.520\n who have like intertwining characters.\n\n2:49:57.520 --> 2:49:59.000\n He's a New England prep school guy.\n\n2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:00.680\n And so a lot of like the stories\n\n2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:05.400\n and a lot of the visuals rang true for me\n\n2:50:05.400 --> 2:50:07.760\n and anyone who can write four pages of prose\n\n2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:10.480\n on like a Huey Lewis album, I mean, kudos to you.\n\n2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:14.720\n And I also would say no one will do this,\n\n2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:19.600\n but I would at some point read as much\n\n2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:23.120\n of one of the big three religious texts as possible.\n\n2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:25.480\n It really gives you perspective.\n\n2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:30.280\n There are so many overlapping stories of religious texts.\n\n2:50:30.280 --> 2:50:31.760\n And then the way that they're written\n\n2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:33.680\n gives you a unique perspective\n\n2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:37.520\n on different people throughout the world.\n\n2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:41.160\n And if you're a Roman Catholic,\n\n2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:43.640\n maybe don't read the Bible, read one of the other texts.\n\n2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:45.800\n And that would be an interesting take, but.\n\n2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:47.400\n I'm embarrassed to say that, first of all,\n\n2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:50.520\n I've never read the Bible, which is embarrassing to say.\n\n2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:52.200\n It's like I read a bunch of stuff about the Bible\n\n2:50:52.200 --> 2:50:53.160\n and not the Bible itself.\n\n2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:55.240\n And the same, not equating them,\n\n2:50:55.240 --> 2:50:58.560\n but I haven't read Marx directly.\n\n2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:01.200\n I haven't read Mein Kampf by Hitler directly.\n\n2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:02.360\n And it feels like sometimes,\n\n2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:05.000\n cause you think like it's better to read stuff\n\n2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:08.360\n about the books, but ultimately you want,\n\n2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:10.440\n because like the analysis will be better\n\n2:51:10.440 --> 2:51:13.960\n in texts that followed it,\n\n2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:18.960\n but there's value to actually reading like the actual words.\n\n2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:22.880\n Yeah, there's this power in the words\n\n2:51:22.880 --> 2:51:25.920\n that there's a reason why like the Bible\n\n2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:29.040\n is one of the most impactful books ever.\n\n2:51:29.040 --> 2:51:32.120\n You know, it's in those words\n\n2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:34.960\n and it's a value to return to those words.\n\n2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:36.920\n The communist manifesto is truly frightening\n\n2:51:36.920 --> 2:51:40.360\n if you read it in like modern context.\n\n2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:42.760\n It's worth reading.\n\n2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:43.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:51:43.600 --> 2:51:44.440\n It's worth reading.\n\n2:51:44.440 --> 2:51:46.240\n And so is Mein Kampf, not obviously,\n\n2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:50.720\n well, it's not obvious, but it is not very well written,\n\n2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:53.520\n but all the ideas that led to the evil that is Hitler\n\n2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:57.640\n are all in there, which is fascinating to think about\n\n2:51:57.640 --> 2:51:59.920\n because probably some of the world leaders at the time\n\n2:51:59.920 --> 2:52:01.040\n should have probably read the books.\n\n2:52:01.040 --> 2:52:02.840\n He outlined everything he's gonna do.\n\n2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:07.840\n Offline, you mentioned an Emerson quote that I really like.\n\n2:52:08.560 --> 2:52:12.440\n So let's try to end on this powerful quote.\n\n2:52:12.440 --> 2:52:15.000\n It's easy in the world to live after the world's opinion.\n\n2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:17.400\n It's easy in solitude to live after your own.\n\n2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:19.640\n The great man is who in the midst of the world\n\n2:52:19.640 --> 2:52:22.640\n keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.\n\n2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:26.440\n What does this quote mean to you?\n\n2:52:26.440 --> 2:52:29.920\n It kind of reinforces the idea\n\n2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:33.200\n that you're here to live your life\n\n2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:36.520\n and that even when people are trying to\n\n2:52:39.400 --> 2:52:43.680\n influence you or comment on the decisions\n\n2:52:43.680 --> 2:52:44.800\n that you make for your life,\n\n2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:48.760\n you should have the strength to stick by living your life\n\n2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:50.480\n the way you want to live it,\n\n2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:53.480\n that there's one immutable truth for you\n\n2:52:53.480 --> 2:52:55.360\n and it doesn't apply to everyone.\n\n2:52:55.360 --> 2:53:00.360\n And so people who frown upon\n\n2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:06.440\n or judge the way that you live\n\n2:53:06.440 --> 2:53:10.160\n because it's not, air quotes, conventional,\n\n2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:13.320\n their opinion should not be something\n\n2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:17.080\n that impacts the choices that you make.\n\n2:53:17.080 --> 2:53:18.600\n You're in a relationship now.\n\n2:53:18.600 --> 2:53:20.640\n Yes. Is that deeply meaningful?\n\n2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:23.120\n Or are you ultimately still alone?\n\n2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:24.920\n Are you still just a man in the cold\n\n2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:27.480\n of the life that is suffering?\n\n2:53:27.480 --> 2:53:30.440\n No, I'm a man who's warm, nestled in a bosom.\n\n2:53:31.320 --> 2:53:34.800\n I don't think there's a better way to end, John.\n\n2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:39.240\n You're a friend, you're my coach.\n\n2:53:39.240 --> 2:53:41.440\n I'm sure we'll talk many more times in the future.\n\n2:53:41.440 --> 2:53:44.600\n Thanks for wasting all your time with me today.\n\n2:53:44.600 --> 2:53:45.440\n Thanks brother.\n\n2:53:45.440 --> 2:53:46.760\n Thanks Lex, I had an awesome time.\n\n2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:56.760\n Hope to be back soon.\n\n2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:40.520\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
