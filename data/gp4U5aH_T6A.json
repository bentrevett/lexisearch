that you can't really have fiat without war.\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:15.520\n The following is a conversation with Safety Namus,\n\n00:15.520 --> 00:17.880\n one of the central and most impactful economists,\n\n00:17.880 --> 00:21.560\n philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.\n\n00:21.560 --> 00:24.480\n He's an Austrian economist, an anarchist,\n\n00:24.480 --> 00:27.000\n and the author of The Bitcoin Standard\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:29.640\n and the new book, The Fiat Standard.\n\n00:29.640 --> 00:33.760\n Safety does not mince words in his criticism of economists\n\n00:33.760 --> 00:36.800\n and humans in general with whom he disagrees.\n\n00:36.800 --> 00:39.000\n For example, Paul Krugman,\n\n00:39.000 --> 00:41.560\n who is a neo Ecclidean economist\n\n00:41.560 --> 00:43.620\n and a previous guest at this podcast.\n\n00:44.600 --> 00:48.760\n Safety's opinions are strong and often controversial.\n\n00:48.760 --> 00:50.760\n I do push back in this conversation,\n\n00:50.760 --> 00:54.360\n playing devil's advocate or trying to steal man each side.\n\n00:54.360 --> 00:57.960\n But as always, I do so in the service of exploring\n\n00:57.960 --> 01:00.520\n the rich space of ideas that Safety has\n\n01:00.520 --> 01:03.680\n about human nature and human civilization.\n\n01:03.680 --> 01:06.720\n I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,\n\n01:06.720 --> 01:09.160\n to come to your own conclusions.\n\n01:09.160 --> 01:12.600\n That is the burden of being a free thinking human.\n\n01:12.600 --> 01:14.820\n It is on each of us individually\n\n01:14.820 --> 01:17.840\n to dive into this chaos of ideas.\n\n01:17.840 --> 01:19.120\n And from that chaos,\n\n01:19.120 --> 01:23.220\n discover long lasting universal wisdom to live by.\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:26.120\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:26.120 --> 01:28.120\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:28.120 --> 01:29.480\n in the description.\n\n01:29.480 --> 01:32.880\n And now, dear friends, here's Safety Amoose.\n\n01:33.780 --> 01:35.720\n Let's start with a big question.\n\n01:35.720 --> 01:37.600\n What is money?\n\n01:37.600 --> 01:39.040\n And what is the role of money\n\n01:39.040 --> 01:40.680\n in the history of human civilization?\n\n01:40.680 --> 01:42.400\n Money is a medium of exchange.\n\n01:42.400 --> 01:44.660\n The thing that defines money is that it is a good\n\n01:44.660 --> 01:46.820\n that you don't buy for its own sake\n\n01:46.820 --> 01:48.440\n because you wanna consume it itself\n\n01:48.440 --> 01:50.840\n or because you want to employ it\n\n01:50.840 --> 01:51.900\n in the production of other goods,\n\n01:51.900 --> 01:53.440\n which is what capital goods are.\n\n01:53.440 --> 01:55.840\n So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.\n\n01:55.840 --> 01:57.520\n Money is distinct from those two\n\n01:57.520 --> 01:59.420\n because it is a good that is acquired\n\n01:59.420 --> 02:01.920\n purely to be exchanged later on for other goods.\n\n02:01.920 --> 02:05.160\n So it's not something that you acquire for its own sake,\n\n02:05.160 --> 02:07.800\n you acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.\n\n02:07.800 --> 02:09.720\n And that's a market good.\n\n02:09.720 --> 02:12.000\n That's a market good like all other goods.\n\n02:12.000 --> 02:14.080\n You acquire food because you eat it,\n\n02:14.080 --> 02:16.120\n you acquire a car to move you around,\n\n02:16.120 --> 02:17.880\n you acquire money so that you can exchange it\n\n02:17.880 --> 02:19.480\n for other goods.\n\n02:19.480 --> 02:21.640\n And that's something that many people\n\n02:21.640 --> 02:22.880\n have a hard time grasping,\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:25.040\n of the concept of money as a market good.\n\n02:25.040 --> 02:27.880\n But it is a market good, just like all others.\n\n02:27.880 --> 02:31.440\n And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade.\n\n02:31.440 --> 02:35.760\n It allows us to develop the division of labor,\n\n02:35.760 --> 02:37.280\n which would not be possible\n\n02:37.280 --> 02:39.920\n at any kind of sophisticated level without money.\n\n02:39.920 --> 02:44.360\n So if we live in a small society of 10 people,\n\n02:44.360 --> 02:46.540\n then think about all the things that we can make,\n\n02:46.540 --> 02:49.040\n all the things that we can produce.\n\n02:49.040 --> 02:51.780\n If we're only 10 people isolated from the world,\n\n02:51.780 --> 02:53.520\n there's only very few things that we can make.\n\n02:53.520 --> 02:56.680\n And therefore we can exchange those things directly\n\n02:56.680 --> 02:57.900\n with one another.\n\n02:57.900 --> 03:02.700\n But as, you know, if we get in contact with other societies\n\n03:02.700 --> 03:04.160\n that have more people,\n\n03:04.160 --> 03:06.660\n then the opportunities for specialization increase.\n\n03:06.660 --> 03:07.760\n You know, if there's 10 people,\n\n03:07.760 --> 03:10.880\n the only thing that you can make is the very basics\n\n03:10.880 --> 03:12.120\n you need for your survival.\n\n03:12.120 --> 03:15.700\n But if you're part of an economy of 10 million people,\n\n03:15.700 --> 03:17.440\n there's much more room for specialization.\n\n03:17.440 --> 03:19.820\n You can make a car, you can make a house,\n\n03:19.820 --> 03:22.000\n that's very sophisticated.\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:24.440\n And that relies on the division of labor.\n\n03:24.440 --> 03:26.640\n That relies on you specializing\n\n03:26.640 --> 03:28.960\n in doing one tiny little thing,\n\n03:28.960 --> 03:30.760\n which is not what you consume.\n\n03:30.760 --> 03:33.280\n You know, and you trade that thing\n\n03:33.280 --> 03:34.680\n for all the things that you consume.\n\n03:34.680 --> 03:37.600\n So as the economy becomes more sophisticated\n\n03:37.600 --> 03:38.900\n and involves more people,\n\n03:38.900 --> 03:41.240\n and currently we're all part of an economy\n\n03:41.240 --> 03:43.680\n of almost 8 billion people,\n\n03:43.680 --> 03:46.600\n each one of us produces one tiny little thing.\n\n03:46.600 --> 03:48.960\n And they exchange that thing\n\n03:48.960 --> 03:50.720\n for all the things that they want.\n\n03:50.720 --> 03:52.400\n And so, because we specialize,\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:53.600\n we become more productive\n\n03:53.600 --> 03:55.480\n in doing the thing that we're good at.\n\n03:55.480 --> 03:57.940\n So, you know, there's people out there who are engineers,\n\n03:57.940 --> 04:00.000\n who are designing windshields in cars.\n\n04:00.000 --> 04:01.660\n It's a very specialized thing.\n\n04:01.660 --> 04:05.200\n They sell windshield design to Mercedes Benz.\n\n04:05.200 --> 04:07.480\n And then from that, you know,\n\n04:07.480 --> 04:09.600\n that windshield design is added on\n\n04:09.600 --> 04:11.480\n to millions of cars around the world.\n\n04:11.480 --> 04:14.240\n And from that, they're able to get enough money\n\n04:14.240 --> 04:16.020\n to meet all of their needs.\n\n04:16.020 --> 04:19.440\n So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money,\n\n04:19.440 --> 04:20.840\n because without money,\n\n04:20.840 --> 04:23.680\n it's very difficult to be able to exchange\n\n04:23.680 --> 04:24.800\n a large number of goods.\n\n04:24.800 --> 04:27.300\n It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy\n\n04:27.300 --> 04:29.160\n with a large degree of specialization,\n\n04:29.160 --> 04:33.560\n because it's very difficult to find people\n\n04:33.560 --> 04:36.020\n who want the thing that you have\n\n04:36.020 --> 04:37.760\n and have the thing that you want.\n\n04:37.760 --> 04:40.640\n We call this the coincidence of wants.\n\n04:40.640 --> 04:42.720\n And that's really the problem that money solves.\n\n04:42.720 --> 04:46.720\n So you make apples and I make oranges.\n\n04:46.720 --> 04:48.420\n I'd like to have some of your apples,\n\n04:48.420 --> 04:50.080\n but you don't want my oranges.\n\n04:50.080 --> 04:52.240\n And that's, we have a problem of coincidence of wants.\n\n04:52.240 --> 04:53.080\n So what do I do?\n\n04:53.080 --> 04:54.140\n You want bananas.\n\n04:54.140 --> 04:56.280\n I need to find somebody who has bananas,\n\n04:56.280 --> 04:58.240\n give them my oranges, take their bananas,\n\n04:58.240 --> 05:00.900\n give you their bananas, and then I take the apples.\n\n05:00.900 --> 05:03.440\n In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.\n\n05:03.440 --> 05:06.400\n So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve\n\n05:06.400 --> 05:07.840\n and will emerge in an economy\n\n05:07.840 --> 05:09.680\n as an economy becomes more sophisticated.\n\n05:09.680 --> 05:12.940\n As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods,\n\n05:12.940 --> 05:15.780\n it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation\n\n05:15.780 --> 05:18.480\n where we have the problem of coincidence of wants.\n\n05:18.480 --> 05:21.720\n And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.\n\n05:21.720 --> 05:22.560\n And it can be anything.\n\n05:22.560 --> 05:25.960\n It can be a banana, it can be food stuff,\n\n05:25.960 --> 05:28.240\n it can be any kind of good.\n\n05:28.240 --> 05:29.920\n As long as I acquire the good\n\n05:29.920 --> 05:32.580\n with the purpose of passing it on to you,\n\n05:32.580 --> 05:35.280\n not for the purpose of me consuming it or using it,\n\n05:35.280 --> 05:36.920\n then that's a medium of exchange.\n\n05:36.920 --> 05:40.000\n So when we look at the entirety of human society\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:42.600\n of millions of billions of people,\n\n05:42.600 --> 05:46.480\n you think of them, just a bunch of individuals running around.\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:49.520\n I love the term coincidence of wants.\n\n05:49.520 --> 05:52.660\n So each one of them, it's like a stochastic system.\n\n05:52.660 --> 05:56.800\n They have desires, it's like a random collection of desires,\n\n05:56.800 --> 05:59.000\n somehow rooted in our evolutionary history,\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:01.600\n but mostly random in terms of preference\n\n06:01.600 --> 06:04.240\n of banana or apple, that kind of thing.\n\n06:04.240 --> 06:08.600\n And then they also have the capacity for competence\n\n06:08.600 --> 06:11.880\n and excellence in particular kind of labor.\n\n06:11.880 --> 06:16.560\n So like specialization, they're able to be like incredible\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:18.140\n at a particular set of tasks.\n\n06:18.140 --> 06:20.760\n So there's a bunch of ants running around\n\n06:20.760 --> 06:23.180\n with consciousness and intelligence,\n\n06:23.180 --> 06:26.560\n and they have desires and they have capabilities.\n\n06:26.560 --> 06:31.560\n And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have\n\n06:32.840 --> 06:34.520\n and the capabilities they have,\n\n06:34.520 --> 06:36.320\n and you wanted to create a system\n\n06:36.320 --> 06:39.300\n that kind of exchanges those things.\n\n06:39.300 --> 06:44.300\n So when you imagine like what is a good, what is markets?\n\n06:45.160 --> 06:49.600\n When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system,\n\n06:49.600 --> 06:50.880\n what do you imagine?\n\n06:50.880 --> 06:51.920\n What is a market?\n\n06:52.960 --> 06:53.920\n A market is just the name\n\n06:53.920 --> 06:55.720\n for the naturally emergent phenomena\n\n06:55.720 --> 06:58.300\n of people voluntarily exchanging things.\n\n06:58.300 --> 07:00.060\n It's at any scale.\n\n07:00.060 --> 07:01.280\n At any scale, yeah.\n\n07:01.280 --> 07:03.160\n Individually, it could be a market of two people\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:04.600\n on an island on their own.\n\n07:04.600 --> 07:07.900\n It could be 8 billion people across the planet.\n\n07:07.900 --> 07:09.480\n Naturally emerging.\n\n07:09.480 --> 07:12.480\n Yes, this is the thing I think that is very hard\n\n07:12.480 --> 07:15.440\n for many people who don't have a good understanding\n\n07:15.440 --> 07:18.880\n of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets\n\n07:18.880 --> 07:23.480\n are not something that you need a central planner\n\n07:23.480 --> 07:26.840\n or a government officer to make happen.\n\n07:26.840 --> 07:28.300\n Capitalism is just what happens\n\n07:28.300 --> 07:30.080\n when people are left to their own devices.\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:34.420\n It's just our cognitive capacity allows us to develop tools\n\n07:34.420 --> 07:36.240\n that we can use for production.\n\n07:36.240 --> 07:37.920\n And that's what we do.\n\n07:37.920 --> 07:39.040\n That's what humans have been doing\n\n07:39.040 --> 07:42.160\n since they started making spears to hunt.\n\n07:42.160 --> 07:44.260\n That's the first capital good probably.\n\n07:44.260 --> 07:46.240\n So we're constantly accumulating capital.\n\n07:46.240 --> 07:47.720\n We're constantly trading with one another.\n\n07:47.720 --> 07:49.400\n We find an opportunity.\n\n07:49.400 --> 07:50.560\n You've got a lot of oranges.\n\n07:50.560 --> 07:52.520\n I've got a lot of apples.\n\n07:52.520 --> 07:53.840\n Then I'll take some of yours.\n\n07:53.840 --> 07:54.680\n You'll take some of mine.\n\n07:54.680 --> 07:56.040\n We're both better off.\n\n07:56.040 --> 07:58.920\n This is just a naturally emergent thing.\n\n07:58.920 --> 08:03.080\n And money is what makes it enormously powerful.\n\n08:03.080 --> 08:05.320\n Money is what allows it to scale really.\n\n08:05.320 --> 08:09.240\n Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies\n\n08:09.240 --> 08:11.320\n into just something that is global.\n\n08:11.320 --> 08:14.940\n Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier,\n\n08:14.940 --> 08:17.120\n all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing,\n\n08:17.120 --> 08:18.340\n the thing that you do best,\n\n08:18.340 --> 08:19.800\n and then you exchange that for money.\n\n08:19.800 --> 08:21.300\n And you don't have to worry\n\n08:21.300 --> 08:24.320\n about whether the other people involved in this\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:26.600\n want what you have and have what you want.\n\n08:26.600 --> 08:30.000\n You just sell it for money to whoever wants it.\n\n08:30.000 --> 08:32.840\n And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.\n\n08:32.840 --> 08:37.240\n And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden\n\n08:37.240 --> 08:39.480\n of how a market economy functions.\n\n08:39.480 --> 08:40.920\n So the first thing that I would say about money\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:43.160\n is that it allows for the division of labor\n\n08:43.160 --> 08:45.400\n and it allows for the market system to grow.\n\n08:45.400 --> 08:48.000\n And the second thing is that money is a mechanism\n\n08:48.000 --> 08:50.580\n for storing value into the future.\n\n08:50.580 --> 08:53.760\n So again, as humans, we develop the capacity\n\n08:53.760 --> 08:55.840\n to think for the future.\n\n08:55.840 --> 08:58.640\n We make a spear so that we can hunt,\n\n08:58.640 --> 09:00.360\n and then we see that it works.\n\n09:00.360 --> 09:01.640\n And then we take it out of the animal\n\n09:01.640 --> 09:02.960\n that we hunted it with,\n\n09:02.960 --> 09:05.600\n and we keep it for the next day's hunt.\n\n09:05.600 --> 09:07.120\n And then we start making a better spear,\n\n09:07.120 --> 09:08.480\n and we make a better fishing rod,\n\n09:08.480 --> 09:09.720\n and then we make a fishing net,\n\n09:09.720 --> 09:11.360\n and then we make a fishing boat.\n\n09:11.360 --> 09:15.200\n And that's our ability to think of the future.\n\n09:15.200 --> 09:18.000\n And as we start building durable goods,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:19.840\n we start thinking more and more of the future.\n\n09:19.840 --> 09:22.940\n We start becoming more and more future oriented.\n\n09:22.940 --> 09:26.580\n And that's really the process of civilization,\n\n09:26.580 --> 09:29.480\n the process of denying our needs now\n\n09:29.480 --> 09:31.140\n in order to think for the future.\n\n09:31.140 --> 09:33.760\n So instead of spending all of our day on the beach,\n\n09:33.760 --> 09:38.080\n enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure\n\n09:38.080 --> 09:42.480\n on the beach and spend some time making a spear\n\n09:42.480 --> 09:45.320\n or making a fishing rod so that our productivity\n\n09:45.320 --> 09:48.120\n in hunting or fishing tomorrow is gonna be higher.\n\n09:48.120 --> 09:51.840\n And so that ability to think for the future\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:54.680\n is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.\n\n09:54.680 --> 09:56.840\n And we do that with durable goods.\n\n09:56.840 --> 10:00.760\n But then money ends up being the best mechanism\n\n10:00.760 --> 10:02.160\n for providing for the future,\n\n10:02.160 --> 10:04.440\n because the future is uncertain.\n\n10:04.440 --> 10:07.960\n So you can save your apples and oranges.\n\n10:07.960 --> 10:09.600\n You can save the spears.\n\n10:09.600 --> 10:12.120\n You can save the animal that you hunted.\n\n10:12.120 --> 10:15.240\n But these things, first they rot.\n\n10:15.240 --> 10:17.620\n They're not very good at holding onto their value over time.\n\n10:17.620 --> 10:19.160\n But even if they were,\n\n10:19.160 --> 10:22.440\n even if you have objects that are durable,\n\n10:22.440 --> 10:24.400\n the problem with them is that you don't know\n\n10:24.400 --> 10:28.200\n if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year.\n\n10:28.200 --> 10:30.320\n You're not sure if you're going to be needing them.\n\n10:30.320 --> 10:31.920\n And you might end up not needing them.\n\n10:31.920 --> 10:33.960\n And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them\n\n10:33.960 --> 10:35.200\n or finding somebody who needs them,\n\n10:35.200 --> 10:36.440\n but doesn't value them much\n\n10:36.440 --> 10:38.380\n and won't give you much in exchange.\n\n10:38.380 --> 10:40.040\n Money allows you the optionality\n\n10:40.040 --> 10:43.760\n of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.\n\n10:43.760 --> 10:46.000\n So it's something that you can sell tomorrow\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:47.720\n with the least uncertainty.\n\n10:47.720 --> 10:49.400\n It has the most liquidity, the most ability\n\n10:49.400 --> 10:52.520\n to be sold without a loss in its value.\n\n10:52.520 --> 10:55.080\n So money is our most advanced technology\n\n10:55.080 --> 10:58.480\n and our best technology for moving value into the future.\n\n10:58.480 --> 11:01.320\n And so I think history really,\n\n11:01.320 --> 11:03.680\n I argue this in all my books,\n\n11:03.680 --> 11:06.440\n is that really history we see,\n\n11:06.440 --> 11:10.640\n we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder.\n\n11:10.640 --> 11:12.860\n And so our money gets better\n\n11:12.860 --> 11:16.040\n at holding onto its value for the future.\n\n11:16.040 --> 11:18.540\n And by harder, I mean harder to produce.\n\n11:18.540 --> 11:20.760\n We find things that are hard to produce\n\n11:20.760 --> 11:23.080\n that are better at holding onto their value.\n\n11:23.080 --> 11:25.400\n So they hold onto their value better for the future.\n\n11:25.400 --> 11:28.300\n And that allows us to plot and plan for the future.\n\n11:28.300 --> 11:31.160\n That makes the future less uncertain.\n\n11:31.160 --> 11:33.940\n And that makes us more future oriented.\n\n11:33.940 --> 11:36.600\n In other words, it lowers our time preference.\n\n11:36.600 --> 11:38.800\n And the harder the money is,\n\n11:38.800 --> 11:41.480\n the better it is at allowing us to think of the future.\n\n11:41.480 --> 11:44.960\n So people should know that you've written the book\n\n11:44.960 --> 11:48.760\n Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.\n\n11:48.760 --> 11:51.200\n And then a new book called Fiat Standard.\n\n11:52.080 --> 11:55.400\n The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible\n\n11:55.400 --> 11:57.760\n in the cryptocurrency space, in the Bitcoin space\n\n11:57.760 --> 12:01.720\n of just a very rigorous systematic explanation\n\n12:01.720 --> 12:06.360\n of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be,\n\n12:06.360 --> 12:07.440\n why is it good?\n\n12:07.440 --> 12:10.780\n So you're describing in that book and in the new book,\n\n12:10.780 --> 12:14.240\n different implementations of the technology of money.\n\n12:14.240 --> 12:17.520\n In the new book, you talk about fiat money,\n\n12:17.520 --> 12:19.480\n which is another way to do money.\n\n12:19.480 --> 12:22.600\n So obviously, there's a lot of different ways to do money.\n\n12:22.600 --> 12:25.080\n And maybe you haven't discovered the best way to do money,\n\n12:25.080 --> 12:28.320\n yet our conversation today is how to do money better.\n\n12:29.440 --> 12:33.240\n Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually, right?\n\n12:33.240 --> 12:35.000\n Very good reasons why we won't.\n\n12:35.000 --> 12:37.280\n Well, we can disagree.\n\n12:37.280 --> 12:39.400\n We can agree to disagree on this.\n\n12:39.400 --> 12:41.400\n I'm open minded to the bananas.\n\n12:42.360 --> 12:44.140\n One of the biggest source of joy to me\n\n12:44.140 --> 12:48.040\n when I first came to this country is eating bananas.\n\n12:48.040 --> 12:53.040\n And so maybe money, happiness, perishable happiness\n\n12:53.040 --> 12:58.040\n will eventually become the best medium of exchange.\n\n12:58.400 --> 13:00.040\n I don't know, open minded.\n\n13:00.040 --> 13:03.180\n Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.\n\n13:03.180 --> 13:05.480\n So there's different ways to do money.\n\n13:05.480 --> 13:06.560\n What is hard money?\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:08.360\n What is soft money?\n\n13:08.360 --> 13:10.360\n In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument\n\n13:10.360 --> 13:14.820\n that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make.\n\n13:14.820 --> 13:17.460\n Historically, I think we see many examples of that.\n\n13:17.460 --> 13:20.080\n So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money\n\n13:20.080 --> 13:22.320\n because nobody can make cigarettes in prison.\n\n13:22.320 --> 13:25.240\n In societies, we have the example of Yap Island,\n\n13:25.240 --> 13:28.080\n for instance, it's an island that doesn't have any limestone\n\n13:28.080 --> 13:31.360\n but there's a nearby island that has a lot of limestone.\n\n13:31.360 --> 13:34.640\n And it's very expensive obviously with primitive technology\n\n13:34.640 --> 13:38.160\n to move limestone from Palau to Yap.\n\n13:38.160 --> 13:41.600\n So on Yap, limestones were money.\n\n13:41.600 --> 13:44.040\n Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find\n\n13:44.040 --> 13:48.200\n end up serving as money in places where they're rare.\n\n13:48.200 --> 13:50.720\n Glass beads were money in West Africa\n\n13:50.720 --> 13:52.720\n where there was no glass making technology\n\n13:52.720 --> 13:54.680\n because they were imported from abroad\n\n13:54.680 --> 13:56.280\n and they were very hard to make.\n\n13:57.280 --> 13:59.400\n And I think there's a conscious effort\n\n13:59.400 --> 14:02.280\n of some people might recognize the hardness\n\n14:02.280 --> 14:04.480\n and the scarcity and choose this as money.\n\n14:04.480 --> 14:05.920\n But I think what's more important\n\n14:05.920 --> 14:08.480\n is just a natural evolutionary process\n\n14:08.480 --> 14:12.920\n whereby people choose all kinds of random things as money,\n\n14:12.920 --> 14:14.600\n bananas maybe even.\n\n14:14.600 --> 14:17.360\n But then the people who end up making these bad choices\n\n14:17.360 --> 14:18.960\n don't end up with any wealth left.\n\n14:18.960 --> 14:21.320\n Whereas the people who store their wealth\n\n14:21.320 --> 14:24.040\n in the things that are hard to make\n\n14:24.040 --> 14:26.880\n end up maintaining their wealth\n\n14:26.880 --> 14:29.120\n and maybe even increasing it over time.\n\n14:29.120 --> 14:32.000\n And of course this culminated in the 19th century,\n\n14:32.000 --> 14:33.160\n in the end of the 19th century\n\n14:33.160 --> 14:36.920\n by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.\n\n14:36.920 --> 14:37.760\n And that's...\n\n14:37.760 --> 14:38.640\n What is a gold standard?\n\n14:38.640 --> 14:41.800\n The gold standard is basically when money is gold\n\n14:41.800 --> 14:44.720\n or at least government currencies backed by gold.\n\n14:44.720 --> 14:46.800\n But the reason gold became money\n\n14:46.800 --> 14:49.120\n and not copper, not nickel, not bananas\n\n14:49.120 --> 14:52.160\n is that gold is the hardest metal in the world.\n\n14:52.160 --> 14:55.960\n And it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.\n\n14:55.960 --> 14:58.000\n And the reason for that is based in chemistry.\n\n14:58.000 --> 15:01.080\n So gold is indestructible.\n\n15:01.080 --> 15:03.680\n You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense.\n\n15:03.680 --> 15:08.680\n It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.\n\n15:08.680 --> 15:12.400\n The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt\n\n15:12.400 --> 15:16.080\n is today probably in somebody's necklace\n\n15:16.080 --> 15:17.120\n or in somebody's gold coin.\n\n15:17.120 --> 15:17.960\n It's still there.\n\n15:17.960 --> 15:21.000\n So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.\n\n15:21.000 --> 15:23.240\n They dig it out of the ground, they refine it\n\n15:23.240 --> 15:25.880\n and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin\n\n15:25.880 --> 15:27.440\n and then it just stays there.\n\n15:27.440 --> 15:29.880\n It gets melted down into new other forms.\n\n15:29.880 --> 15:31.520\n The jewelry gets turned into coins\n\n15:31.520 --> 15:33.200\n or coins get turned into bars.\n\n15:34.240 --> 15:38.560\n But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating.\n\n15:38.560 --> 15:41.920\n On the other hand, every year we get better\n\n15:41.920 --> 15:43.880\n at our technology of looking for gold.\n\n15:43.880 --> 15:45.400\n There's more people all over the world.\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:47.880\n The population increases, the technology improves.\n\n15:47.880 --> 15:49.960\n So we keep finding more and more gold\n\n15:49.960 --> 15:52.080\n and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.\n\n15:52.080 --> 15:55.240\n However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile\n\n15:55.240 --> 15:57.720\n that is not being devalued,\n\n15:57.720 --> 15:59.280\n sorry, that is not being consumed\n\n15:59.280 --> 16:00.600\n because there's no way of consuming gold.\n\n16:00.600 --> 16:04.800\n You can't eat it, you can't burn it, it doesn't rust.\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:07.320\n Because of that, we're constantly adding\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:08.920\n to a constantly growing stockpile.\n\n16:08.920 --> 16:11.000\n So if you look at the numbers,\n\n16:11.000 --> 16:13.240\n you see over the last 100 years,\n\n16:13.240 --> 16:16.360\n we've got pretty reliable data on gold production worldwide.\n\n16:16.360 --> 16:19.120\n We see that pretty much gold stockpiles increase\n\n16:19.120 --> 16:22.480\n at around one and a half to 2% per year, every year.\n\n16:22.480 --> 16:25.200\n So yes, we're making more every year,\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:28.080\n but we're making more so we're adding to the stockpile.\n\n16:28.080 --> 16:29.200\n The stockpile grows more.\n\n16:29.200 --> 16:31.560\n So every year we're adding only around one and a half\n\n16:31.560 --> 16:33.840\n to 2%.\n\n16:33.840 --> 16:36.360\n Compare that to the second highest,\n\n16:36.360 --> 16:39.160\n the second hardest metal historically was silver.\n\n16:39.160 --> 16:42.400\n And that increased historically at around maybe 5%\n\n16:42.400 --> 16:43.720\n per year or so.\n\n16:43.720 --> 16:46.840\n Now it probably increases at something like closer to 30%\n\n16:46.840 --> 16:49.160\n because it's now getting used extensively\n\n16:49.160 --> 16:50.840\n in industrial uses.\n\n16:50.840 --> 16:53.920\n So when you use it in industry,\n\n16:53.920 --> 16:56.440\n when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera\n\n16:56.440 --> 16:59.520\n or in a machine, effectively,\n\n16:59.520 --> 17:01.040\n you are consuming the stockpile\n\n17:01.040 --> 17:02.600\n because it's not used as money.\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:04.920\n It's taken out of the monetary stockpile.\n\n17:04.920 --> 17:08.320\n So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular,\n\n17:08.320 --> 17:11.960\n and I discussed this in detail in the Bitcoin standard,\n\n17:11.960 --> 17:14.600\n what happened in 1870 was Germany won\n\n17:14.600 --> 17:18.960\n the Franco Prussian war and Germany was on a silver standard,\n\n17:18.960 --> 17:21.160\n but the value of silvers was declining.\n\n17:21.160 --> 17:22.640\n So Germany did something very smart,\n\n17:22.640 --> 17:25.640\n which is they took their indemnity from France\n\n17:25.640 --> 17:30.480\n in silver and gold and use that big chunk of gold\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:33.040\n to switch to going on a gold standard.\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:36.720\n And since then, silver has been collapsing in value\n\n17:36.720 --> 17:37.560\n next to gold.\n\n17:37.560 --> 17:40.080\n So back then the price of an ounce of gold\n\n17:40.080 --> 17:42.080\n was around 15 ounces of silver.\n\n17:42.080 --> 17:43.400\n Today it's closer to 100.\n\n17:43.400 --> 17:46.520\n It's just been declining for the last 150 years.\n\n17:46.520 --> 17:48.480\n And so because of that, because of the fact\n\n17:48.480 --> 17:50.720\n that it's lost its monetary role\n\n17:50.720 --> 17:52.840\n as people shifted toward gold,\n\n17:52.840 --> 17:54.560\n the value of silver went down\n\n17:54.560 --> 17:56.120\n and so it became economical to use it\n\n17:56.120 --> 17:58.240\n in more and more industrial applications.\n\n17:58.240 --> 18:01.880\n So the stockpile declines and then as a result\n\n18:01.880 --> 18:05.160\n that weakens its monetary properties\n\n18:05.160 --> 18:06.720\n more and more and more.\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:09.520\n So that's why by the end of the 19th century,\n\n18:09.520 --> 18:10.840\n I mean at the beginning of the 19th century,\n\n18:10.840 --> 18:12.120\n gold and silver were money.\n\n18:12.120 --> 18:14.400\n By the end, it was basically only gold.\n\n18:14.400 --> 18:16.800\n And the countries that were still on a silver standard,\n\n18:16.800 --> 18:19.680\n China and India in particular suffered enormously from it\n\n18:19.680 --> 18:22.920\n because their money was devaluing very quickly\n\n18:22.920 --> 18:25.800\n next to gold and so Europeans who would come to China\n\n18:25.800 --> 18:28.160\n or India were able to buy things\n\n18:28.160 --> 18:30.280\n at practically a big discount.\n\n18:30.280 --> 18:33.520\n So I hope it's okay if I ask very simple,\n\n18:33.520 --> 18:34.600\n very basic questions.\n\n18:34.600 --> 18:37.680\n There's few people in this world that are good,\n\n18:37.680 --> 18:41.160\n as good as you are at answering very basic,\n\n18:41.160 --> 18:42.920\n almost ridiculously basic questions\n\n18:42.920 --> 18:45.960\n because I think exploring questions like what is money\n\n18:45.960 --> 18:49.080\n is a really great way to think from first principles,\n\n18:49.080 --> 18:50.760\n to really think deeply about this world.\n\n18:50.760 --> 18:52.640\n So I really appreciate you doing that.\n\n18:52.640 --> 18:55.600\n When you say standard, what does it mean?\n\n18:55.600 --> 18:57.560\n When you say silver standard, gold standard,\n\n18:57.560 --> 18:59.920\n again with a basic question.\n\n18:59.920 --> 19:03.800\n The term really I think was based out of gold.\n\n19:03.800 --> 19:06.240\n The first time this came out was the gold standard\n\n19:06.240 --> 19:09.280\n because so I said gold was money\n\n19:09.280 --> 19:10.960\n at the end of the 19th century,\n\n19:10.960 --> 19:13.520\n but it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins\n\n19:13.520 --> 19:15.080\n and trading with gold coins\n\n19:15.080 --> 19:19.320\n because that's got a problem of divisibility.\n\n19:19.320 --> 19:23.400\n So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.\n\n19:23.400 --> 19:25.160\n So how do you buy that thing?\n\n19:25.160 --> 19:28.080\n And the answer was that you created the monetary instruments\n\n19:28.080 --> 19:31.560\n that were backed by gold and so currencies,\n\n19:31.560 --> 19:34.360\n national currencies under the gold standard\n\n19:34.360 --> 19:36.760\n were specific units of gold\n\n19:36.760 --> 19:38.960\n and that's how a gold standard functioned.\n\n19:38.960 --> 19:41.960\n Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper\n\n19:41.960 --> 19:43.880\n that were redeemable in gold.\n\n19:43.880 --> 19:45.080\n So you could go to the central bank,\n\n19:45.080 --> 19:46.920\n you'd give them the piece of paper,\n\n19:46.920 --> 19:49.120\n the $100 bill or the $10 bill\n\n19:49.120 --> 19:50.960\n and they'll give you gold in exchange\n\n19:50.960 --> 19:53.760\n and they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange.\n\n19:53.760 --> 19:56.200\n Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold.\n\n19:56.200 --> 19:59.440\n So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.\n\n19:59.440 --> 20:01.080\n Exactly, that was the plan.\n\n20:01.080 --> 20:03.160\n That was what it's supposed to do,\n\n20:03.160 --> 20:07.240\n but arguably we never had a pure gold standard\n\n20:07.240 --> 20:09.200\n because the nature of gold means\n\n20:09.200 --> 20:12.000\n that the people who are in charge of the gold,\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.480\n they have an enormous amount of power\n\n20:13.480 --> 20:15.120\n because the gold is concentrated with them\n\n20:15.120 --> 20:17.800\n and as long as not everybody shows up at the same time\n\n20:17.800 --> 20:18.840\n asking for their gold,\n\n20:18.840 --> 20:21.720\n then you can make more receipts than you have gold.\n\n20:21.720 --> 20:24.160\n So there's always shady stuff going on,\n\n20:24.160 --> 20:26.120\n but at least that's the state of gold\n\n20:26.120 --> 20:28.320\n is the receipts should exactly represent\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:29.840\n the amount of gold there.\n\n20:29.840 --> 20:31.720\n And also when you say standard,\n\n20:31.720 --> 20:36.720\n it means that governments sort of publicly stated\n\n20:38.160 --> 20:40.480\n that this is the approved,\n\n20:40.480 --> 20:44.040\n the main way of making transactions that are monetary.\n\n20:44.040 --> 20:46.760\n So this is the money, this is the official money\n\n20:46.760 --> 20:48.760\n that you should be using if you live in this country.\n\n20:48.760 --> 20:51.320\n Yes, although I would say it's more like\n\n20:51.320 --> 20:52.160\n the other way around.\n\n20:52.160 --> 20:55.440\n It's not that the governments established gold as money.\n\n20:55.440 --> 21:00.040\n It's more like gold gave the governments\n\n21:00.040 --> 21:01.920\n the credibility for their currencies.\n\n21:01.920 --> 21:06.320\n So governments were not the ones that made gold money.\n\n21:06.320 --> 21:09.480\n Gold has been money before states were invented.\n\n21:10.440 --> 21:12.240\n States, if you have a government\n\n21:12.240 --> 21:14.200\n and you'd like to have some legitimacy\n\n21:14.200 --> 21:16.600\n and you'd like to be able to deal with other governments\n\n21:16.600 --> 21:19.800\n on an equal footing, you had to go by the gold standard.\n\n21:19.800 --> 21:22.480\n You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold\n\n21:22.480 --> 21:24.120\n so that you could trade with the rest of the world\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:28.160\n so that people could in your country use that currency.\n\n21:28.160 --> 21:32.120\n So it's not that governments were choosing gold.\n\n21:32.120 --> 21:35.440\n It's more like they were having to adapt\n\n21:35.440 --> 21:37.760\n their own currencies to gold\n\n21:37.760 --> 21:39.360\n in order to give their currencies credibility.\n\n21:39.360 --> 21:40.960\n So there's a dance there though,\n\n21:40.960 --> 21:43.560\n because if they had to,\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:46.520\n then why did they switch away from it after?\n\n21:46.520 --> 21:49.640\n So there is a dance where the governments,\n\n21:49.640 --> 21:52.120\n the people pressure.\n\n21:52.120 --> 21:56.040\n So first of all, the basic characteristics\n\n21:56.040 --> 21:59.720\n of the hard money pressures the governments\n\n21:59.720 --> 22:02.720\n and the people in terms of what should be used.\n\n22:02.720 --> 22:05.200\n Then the people, based on their community,\n\n22:05.200 --> 22:09.200\n the network effects, the narratives they tell each other,\n\n22:09.200 --> 22:12.400\n all that kind of stuff, they pressure the governments\n\n22:12.400 --> 22:14.080\n to take on a particular money.\n\n22:14.080 --> 22:17.960\n Then the governments, they like power,\n\n22:17.960 --> 22:19.720\n they like control, all those kinds of things.\n\n22:19.720 --> 22:21.080\n They pressure the people\n\n22:21.080 --> 22:22.280\n and tell different kinds of narratives.\n\n22:22.280 --> 22:24.880\n So there's a dance going on in this evolution\n\n22:24.880 --> 22:27.400\n of what technology to use for a monetary system.\n\n22:27.400 --> 22:32.400\n So the reason I don't know if governments had to,\n\n22:32.400 --> 22:34.240\n because they clearly didn't have to,\n\n22:34.240 --> 22:37.440\n because they eventually moved away from it.\n\n22:37.440 --> 22:39.040\n But there was pressure probably.\n\n22:39.040 --> 22:41.320\n Yeah, but even after they moved away from it,\n\n22:41.320 --> 22:42.520\n central banks, until today,\n\n22:42.520 --> 22:45.000\n they still hold a lot of gold reserves.\n\n22:45.000 --> 22:47.480\n In fact, if you look at 1914,\n\n22:47.480 --> 22:51.200\n when the world really went off the gold standard,\n\n22:51.200 --> 22:53.720\n the amount of gold reserves held by central banks\n\n22:53.720 --> 22:55.720\n was a tiny fraction of what it was.\n\n22:55.720 --> 22:57.440\n As time went on,\n\n22:57.440 --> 22:59.840\n central banks accumulated more and more gold.\n\n22:59.840 --> 23:02.160\n What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens\n\n23:02.160 --> 23:04.240\n from using the gold, but they continued to use it.\n\n23:04.240 --> 23:07.560\n So gold continued to be money up until 1971\n\n23:07.560 --> 23:10.800\n because effectively the world was on a dollar standard\n\n23:10.800 --> 23:12.960\n and the dollars were backed by gold.\n\n23:12.960 --> 23:15.600\n But then after 1971, even then,\n\n23:15.600 --> 23:17.280\n central banks continued to accumulate gold\n\n23:17.280 --> 23:20.000\n because why would you as a central bank\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:22.520\n want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively\n\n23:22.520 --> 23:25.240\n or credit liabilities of another central bank\n\n23:25.240 --> 23:27.960\n that can produce them infinitely?\n\n23:27.960 --> 23:31.800\n And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:33.680\n to governments today,\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:36.640\n as we see US sanctions taking, say, Russian reserves\n\n23:36.640 --> 23:37.960\n or Afghanistan reserves.\n\n23:39.040 --> 23:40.840\n And this is why we see China and Russia\n\n23:40.840 --> 23:44.080\n have accumulated a lot of gold over the last 10, 20 years.\n\n23:44.080 --> 23:48.440\n So just to return to the question of definitions,\n\n23:48.440 --> 23:51.000\n so what is hard money versus soft money?\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:54.120\n Yes, so hard, I mean, it's a relative thing,\n\n23:54.120 --> 23:56.560\n but the hardness refers to the difficulty\n\n23:56.560 --> 23:59.520\n of producing more units of the money supply.\n\n23:59.520 --> 24:01.640\n So an easy money would be a money\n\n24:01.640 --> 24:04.480\n that is relatively easy to make.\n\n24:04.480 --> 24:08.840\n So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%\n\n24:08.840 --> 24:09.680\n or something like that.\n\n24:09.680 --> 24:12.640\n So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities,\n\n24:12.640 --> 24:15.560\n other than gold and silver, they're easy money\n\n24:15.560 --> 24:18.920\n and they're not suitable as a monetary medium\n\n24:18.920 --> 24:20.160\n because they're being consumed.\n\n24:20.160 --> 24:22.320\n So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard,\n\n24:22.320 --> 24:25.080\n I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio,\n\n24:25.080 --> 24:28.840\n which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow,\n\n24:28.840 --> 24:31.480\n to the stockpile, the existing stockpile.\n\n24:31.480 --> 24:33.120\n If you look at all the other metals,\n\n24:33.120 --> 24:36.160\n they're easy money because they're being consumed.\n\n24:36.160 --> 24:38.360\n So think about how much stockpiles of copper\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:40.120\n there are in the world today.\n\n24:40.120 --> 24:41.960\n So copper companies obviously have\n\n24:41.960 --> 24:44.000\n some stockpiles of copper.\n\n24:44.000 --> 24:47.080\n Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper,\n\n24:47.080 --> 24:48.600\n but the vast majority of copper\n\n24:48.600 --> 24:53.120\n is essentially on a conveyor belt of production\n\n24:53.120 --> 24:56.840\n from the mine straight to the consumer good\n\n24:56.840 --> 24:58.480\n that it's being used for.\n\n24:58.480 --> 25:01.800\n So the existing stockpiles are roughly\n\n25:01.800 --> 25:04.920\n in the range of one year's production.\n\n25:04.920 --> 25:06.800\n If you take all of the companies,\n\n25:06.800 --> 25:09.040\n I don't have exact statistics,\n\n25:09.040 --> 25:10.440\n hence it's very difficult to get these,\n\n25:10.440 --> 25:12.760\n but it's roughly in the same range.\n\n25:12.760 --> 25:17.280\n Like if copper production were to stop completely today,\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:19.520\n we'll have about a year's production\n\n25:19.520 --> 25:22.000\n stored in various places.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:24.720\n So that makes copper terrible money\n\n25:24.720 --> 25:27.480\n because if you started using copper as money,\n\n25:27.480 --> 25:28.880\n and this is why a lot of people say,\n\n25:28.880 --> 25:30.680\n well, money is a collective illusion.\n\n25:30.680 --> 25:34.240\n Money is a social construct.\n\n25:34.240 --> 25:35.960\n If we all agree that something is money,\n\n25:35.960 --> 25:36.800\n then something is money.\n\n25:36.800 --> 25:37.880\n I think this is completely clueless,\n\n25:37.880 --> 25:40.000\n and it's usually Marxists who believe this,\n\n25:40.000 --> 25:42.280\n obviously no understanding of economics.\n\n25:42.280 --> 25:43.360\n It's completely clueless\n\n25:43.360 --> 25:45.640\n because even if everybody in society\n\n25:45.640 --> 25:47.880\n decided we wanted to make copper as money,\n\n25:47.880 --> 25:50.400\n even if we all decided to collectively\n\n25:50.400 --> 25:53.320\n take part in this hallucination or illusion,\n\n25:53.320 --> 25:54.960\n it would not make copper money.\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:56.720\n It would just make everybody who decides\n\n25:56.720 --> 25:59.480\n to take part in this hallucination poor, that's it.\n\n25:59.480 --> 26:01.040\n It would make copper miners rich.\n\n26:01.040 --> 26:02.240\n It would make all of the people\n\n26:02.240 --> 26:04.160\n who chose copper as money poor,\n\n26:04.160 --> 26:05.640\n and copper would not be money.\n\n26:05.640 --> 26:07.720\n It can't work because what happens is,\n\n26:07.720 --> 26:10.280\n because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,\n\n26:10.280 --> 26:11.320\n if you buy, you know,\n\n26:11.320 --> 26:14.120\n even if you get the 1,000 richest people in the world,\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:16.240\n all of the world's billionaires,\n\n26:16.240 --> 26:17.080\n they get together,\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:19.680\n and they all dump all of the money that they have,\n\n26:19.680 --> 26:22.520\n all the stocks, all the bonds, all the gold,\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:24.440\n all of the Bitcoin, everything that they own,\n\n26:24.440 --> 26:27.520\n they dump it, and they buy copper with it.\n\n26:27.520 --> 26:28.360\n What's gonna happen?\n\n26:28.360 --> 26:30.840\n Price of copper is gonna go up a lot,\n\n26:30.840 --> 26:33.040\n but what's gonna stop copper miners\n\n26:33.040 --> 26:36.000\n from flooding the market with even more copper\n\n26:36.000 --> 26:37.800\n than what the billionaires bought?\n\n26:37.800 --> 26:38.640\n Nothing.\n\n26:38.640 --> 26:41.880\n They're gonna dump all of that extra copper production.\n\n26:41.880 --> 26:43.040\n If the price of copper is gonna go up\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:45.640\n so there will be a lot more copper mining\n\n26:45.640 --> 26:47.080\n than all the other metals,\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:51.080\n a lot of nickel companies and gold miners\n\n26:51.080 --> 26:53.480\n are gonna switch to focusing on copper,\n\n26:53.480 --> 26:56.200\n and then we're gonna dump an enormous amount of copper\n\n26:56.200 --> 26:57.040\n on the market.\n\n26:57.040 --> 26:59.000\n The value of copper is gonna crash,\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:01.560\n and the people who chose copper as money\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:03.760\n are just gonna end up with large warehouses\n\n27:03.760 --> 27:06.480\n of very cheap rusting metal.\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:07.920\n So that's a brilliant description,\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:09.880\n and that kind of pushes towards gold\n\n27:09.880 --> 27:13.240\n where the stock to flow ratio,\n\n27:13.240 --> 27:15.560\n I guess you would say is 1.5 to 2%,\n\n27:15.560 --> 27:16.840\n like you mentioned earlier.\n\n27:16.840 --> 27:18.680\n That would be like the inverse of the stock to flow.\n\n27:18.680 --> 27:19.960\n That's the supply growth rate,\n\n27:19.960 --> 27:21.240\n so the stock to flow is the inverse.\n\n27:21.240 --> 27:22.560\n It's around 60.\n\n27:22.560 --> 27:23.680\n 60, got it.\n\n27:23.680 --> 27:26.000\n But let me push back on,\n\n27:26.000 --> 27:27.800\n as somebody who likes human psychology,\n\n27:27.800 --> 27:30.920\n let me push back on the collective hallucination\n\n27:30.920 --> 27:32.120\n and the illusion.\n\n27:32.120 --> 27:35.860\n So that's for copper, but what about paper money?\n\n27:35.860 --> 27:40.860\n That's not, you can't smoke it,\n\n27:40.980 --> 27:42.420\n you can't eat it.\n\n27:42.420 --> 27:44.820\n It's just, it's supposed to represent,\n\n27:44.820 --> 27:47.020\n it's supposed to just be the medium of exchange,\n\n27:47.020 --> 27:52.020\n and in that sense, what role does collective hallucination\n\n27:53.980 --> 27:56.060\n play in the effectiveness of money?\n\n27:56.060 --> 27:59.060\n Exactly zero, because all of the paper money,\n\n27:59.060 --> 28:00.900\n first of all, there's never been an instance,\n\n28:00.900 --> 28:04.780\n and again, this flies in the face\n\n28:04.780 --> 28:08.180\n of a lot of what a lot of people like to think about money.\n\n28:08.180 --> 28:09.420\n There's never been an instance\n\n28:09.420 --> 28:11.980\n where a government came out and said,\n\n28:11.980 --> 28:13.700\n all right, we're printing out these pieces of paper,\n\n28:13.700 --> 28:14.540\n use them as money.\n\n28:14.540 --> 28:19.020\n This one is worth 10 apples or use it for buying things,\n\n28:19.020 --> 28:19.900\n and here's the piece of paper.\n\n28:19.900 --> 28:21.340\n This has never happened.\n\n28:21.340 --> 28:26.340\n They've always taken fiat money, paper money,\n\n28:26.620 --> 28:30.660\n all of these things were always born out of fraud.\n\n28:30.660 --> 28:32.740\n Initially, it was a receipt for gold,\n\n28:32.740 --> 28:34.860\n and then they told you, well, you know,\n\n28:34.860 --> 28:36.940\n you don't need the gold anyway, and you have to use this,\n\n28:36.940 --> 28:39.460\n and then if you don't use it, we throw you in jail.\n\n28:39.460 --> 28:41.580\n And then, so first of all, it doesn't,\n\n28:42.900 --> 28:44.340\n you can't enforce this thing,\n\n28:44.340 --> 28:45.700\n so it's never really just happened,\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:48.340\n and it's never been hallucinated into existence.\n\n28:48.340 --> 28:50.100\n People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense\n\n28:50.100 --> 28:54.340\n in writing textbooks and books and in academia,\n\n28:54.340 --> 28:57.580\n but in the real world, people don't hallucinate money.\n\n28:57.580 --> 29:00.140\n People are very careful about what they put their money in.\n\n29:00.140 --> 29:01.540\n For people listening,\n\n29:01.540 --> 29:03.100\n we're gonna have fun in this conversation,\n\n29:03.100 --> 29:08.100\n because you already said Marxist, fraud, hallucination,\n\n29:08.340 --> 29:11.500\n just because we use these words doesn't mean they're true,\n\n29:11.500 --> 29:12.900\n but they're fun to talk about.\n\n29:12.900 --> 29:17.220\n So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk,\n\n29:17.220 --> 29:20.100\n which I think is fun,\n\n29:20.100 --> 29:22.400\n but allow me in my dumb self to push back,\n\n29:22.400 --> 29:23.740\n to play devil's advocate,\n\n29:23.740 --> 29:25.180\n and I'll actually ask you sometimes\n\n29:25.180 --> 29:27.180\n to play devil's advocate if possible,\n\n29:27.180 --> 29:28.880\n because you're smarter than me on all this stuff,\n\n29:28.880 --> 29:33.500\n so we want the smartest devil's advocate possible,\n\n29:33.500 --> 29:35.820\n and I'm certainly not that, but anyway,\n\n29:35.820 --> 29:40.820\n but nevertheless, we are currently on a fiat standard,\n\n29:41.460 --> 29:46.460\n so money does have value, paper money,\n\n29:50.420 --> 29:51.900\n and the reason it has value\n\n29:51.900 --> 29:53.780\n is because we believe it has value.\n\n29:53.780 --> 29:57.760\n To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,\n\n29:57.760 --> 30:01.220\n the belief that something is worth value\n\n30:01.220 --> 30:06.060\n is actually value, and is the thing that helps money work,\n\n30:06.060 --> 30:09.220\n because you're saying it's fraud,\n\n30:09.220 --> 30:13.780\n and the belief is almost valueless,\n\n30:13.780 --> 30:14.860\n but how much value?\n\n30:14.860 --> 30:17.380\n Can we quantify the value of the belief,\n\n30:17.380 --> 30:18.460\n the collective belief?\n\n30:18.460 --> 30:21.660\n I should say, all economics is subjective.\n\n30:21.660 --> 30:24.180\n I consider myself an Austrian school economist,\n\n30:24.180 --> 30:26.740\n and the starting point of all Austrian economics\n\n30:26.740 --> 30:28.900\n is that all value is subjective,\n\n30:28.900 --> 30:33.300\n so obviously, value only exists\n\n30:33.300 --> 30:35.900\n because humans choose to make the valuation.\n\n30:35.900 --> 30:40.020\n However, the economic reality of the way that money works\n\n30:40.020 --> 30:42.640\n means that it's just a technology like all others,\n\n30:42.640 --> 30:45.060\n and so for me, when people say,\n\n30:45.060 --> 30:47.220\n well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,\n\n30:47.220 --> 30:48.220\n then it'll be money.\n\n30:48.220 --> 30:49.900\n If we can hallucinate bananas to be money,\n\n30:49.900 --> 30:50.860\n then it'll be money.\n\n30:50.860 --> 30:52.380\n For me, it's like saying, well, if we hallucinate\n\n30:52.380 --> 30:54.960\n that bananas can be spaceships, they'll be spaceships.\n\n30:54.960 --> 30:56.940\n I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want,\n\n30:56.940 --> 30:59.700\n but a banana's not gonna get you to the moon.\n\n30:59.700 --> 31:03.080\n Well, then nevertheless, that's true.\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:05.060\n So you're drawing a big distinction\n\n31:05.060 --> 31:09.340\n between physical reality and the space of belief,\n\n31:09.340 --> 31:14.340\n but it seems like so much power of human civilization,\n\n31:14.580 --> 31:18.940\n so much destruction, so much creativity, creation,\n\n31:18.940 --> 31:21.180\n happens in our minds.\n\n31:21.180 --> 31:23.540\n Absolutely, everything does happen in the mind.\n\n31:23.540 --> 31:24.980\n You're not gonna get to the moon,\n\n31:24.980 --> 31:27.580\n but you might still have a significant impact\n\n31:27.580 --> 31:31.540\n on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.\n\n31:31.540 --> 31:35.420\n True, but economic reality exists in a way\n\n31:35.420 --> 31:37.940\n in which your beliefs are rewarded\n\n31:37.940 --> 31:40.620\n when they match up with economic reality,\n\n31:40.620 --> 31:41.900\n and they're punished when they don't.\n\n31:41.900 --> 31:44.740\n So if you ride a banana and jump off a cliff\n\n31:44.740 --> 31:46.940\n thinking you're gonna get to the moon,\n\n31:46.940 --> 31:48.620\n that solves the problem of people thinking\n\n31:48.620 --> 31:50.620\n that bananas are spaceships by killing people\n\n31:50.620 --> 31:53.020\n who think that bananas are spaceships.\n\n31:53.020 --> 31:55.020\n And I think, to go back to your question\n\n31:55.020 --> 31:56.820\n in terms of paper monies, so yes,\n\n31:56.820 --> 32:01.380\n even though ignoring the original sin\n\n32:01.380 --> 32:02.980\n of the creation of fiat money,\n\n32:02.980 --> 32:05.460\n and ignoring everything that happened before 1971,\n\n32:05.460 --> 32:07.860\n all right, well, here we are, people are using,\n\n32:07.860 --> 32:09.340\n well, it's not really paper money.\n\n32:09.340 --> 32:12.780\n We should say fiat money is predominantly credit.\n\n32:12.780 --> 32:15.020\n So it's also a digital currency.\n\n32:15.020 --> 32:18.780\n So more than 90% of dollars are digital.\n\n32:18.780 --> 32:21.380\n Less than 10% of dollars are physical.\n\n32:21.380 --> 32:22.740\n So it is a digital currency,\n\n32:22.740 --> 32:24.700\n and all over the world, all these governments\n\n32:24.700 --> 32:26.420\n are using digital currencies effectively\n\n32:26.420 --> 32:29.500\n with some physical manifestations in paper.\n\n32:29.500 --> 32:32.380\n But yet, even within these currencies,\n\n32:32.380 --> 32:33.740\n it's still the same analysis,\n\n32:33.740 --> 32:35.140\n and I discussed this in chapter four,\n\n32:35.140 --> 32:36.300\n the Bitcoin standard.\n\n32:36.300 --> 32:37.700\n You look at government monies,\n\n32:37.700 --> 32:40.140\n you see that the currencies that have held onto their value,\n\n32:40.140 --> 32:42.180\n the ones that have the biggest value,\n\n32:42.180 --> 32:44.660\n the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,\n\n32:44.660 --> 32:46.900\n the ones that are used as currency reserves\n\n32:46.900 --> 32:48.100\n all over the world,\n\n32:48.100 --> 32:50.860\n are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rate.\n\n32:50.860 --> 32:53.420\n The ones that grow, whose central banks\n\n32:53.420 --> 32:55.380\n are the least inflationary.\n\n32:55.380 --> 32:56.420\n And on the other hand,\n\n32:56.420 --> 32:58.900\n the ones who supplies more inflationary,\n\n32:58.900 --> 33:00.900\n similar to copper, end up failing.\n\n33:00.900 --> 33:03.460\n You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, Zimbabwe,\n\n33:03.460 --> 33:06.500\n these are currencies whose supply increases very quickly,\n\n33:06.500 --> 33:09.060\n and therefore, their value collapses.\n\n33:09.060 --> 33:12.540\n Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the Euro,\n\n33:12.540 --> 33:14.940\n the British pound, the Japanese yen,\n\n33:14.940 --> 33:17.140\n they increase at a much lower rate in general\n\n33:17.140 --> 33:20.220\n than these terrible currencies.\n\n33:20.220 --> 33:21.940\n And that's why all over the world,\n\n33:21.940 --> 33:24.180\n you see people are looking to get more dollars\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:28.180\n and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.\n\n33:28.180 --> 33:32.380\n So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money\n\n33:32.380 --> 33:37.380\n and the ease of money is pretty well supported empirically.\n\n33:37.580 --> 33:40.780\n So like you said, you're at least in part,\n\n33:40.780 --> 33:43.740\n or in whole, consider yourself an Austrian economist.\n\n33:44.740 --> 33:48.980\n So you're perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.\n\n33:48.980 --> 33:50.500\n What is Austrian economics?\n\n33:50.500 --> 33:52.220\n What is Keynesian economics?\n\n33:52.220 --> 33:54.660\n How do you compare the two?\n\n33:54.660 --> 33:56.340\n What should people know?\n\n33:56.340 --> 33:59.580\n What are the interesting defining characteristics\n\n33:59.580 --> 34:01.700\n to you about these schools of thought?\n\n34:01.700 --> 34:03.340\n So Austrian economics, the way that I say it,\n\n34:03.340 --> 34:04.900\n Austrian economics is economics.\n\n34:04.900 --> 34:07.660\n It's, we call it Austrian economics\n\n34:07.660 --> 34:09.420\n because economics has been hijacked\n\n34:09.420 --> 34:11.420\n by a bunch of frauds, really.\n\n34:11.420 --> 34:12.860\n Or people who are wrong, okay.\n\n34:12.860 --> 34:14.540\n Well, it's much worse than wrong,\n\n34:14.540 --> 34:16.620\n by people who are just essentially propagandists\n\n34:16.620 --> 34:17.460\n for inflation.\n\n34:17.460 --> 34:18.500\n Right.\n\n34:18.500 --> 34:19.340\n So.\n\n34:19.340 --> 34:20.180\n It's like your opinion, man.\n\n34:20.180 --> 34:21.020\n Right.\n\n34:21.020 --> 34:23.820\n Yeah, well, that's also like your opinion, man.\n\n34:23.820 --> 34:24.660\n Yeah.\n\n34:24.660 --> 34:25.500\n But you asked.\n\n34:25.500 --> 34:26.340\n That's true.\n\n34:26.340 --> 34:28.620\n Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast.\n\n34:28.620 --> 34:32.740\n So he's, the O speaks enough,\n\n34:32.740 --> 34:35.500\n but he's one of the people\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:38.700\n that is perhaps most harshly criticized\n\n34:38.700 --> 34:42.660\n by folks in Austrian economics perspective\n\n34:42.660 --> 34:45.740\n and vice versa, which is a fascinating tension.\n\n34:45.740 --> 34:48.940\n Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor\n\n34:48.940 --> 34:51.220\n who plays an economist on TV and the internet.\n\n34:52.420 --> 34:55.420\n So anyway, now tell me what you really think.\n\n34:55.420 --> 34:58.580\n No, but, so the basics of what is Austrian economics?\n\n34:58.580 --> 35:00.580\n What is the, what perspective does it take on the world?\n\n35:00.580 --> 35:02.980\n Yeah, so I mean, Austrian economics really is\n\n35:03.900 --> 35:06.060\n the continuation of a tradition\n\n35:06.060 --> 35:08.380\n that it goes back to the ancient Greeks\n\n35:08.380 --> 35:09.660\n of studying economics.\n\n35:09.660 --> 35:13.260\n Historically, it's really just economics\n\n35:13.260 --> 35:14.620\n and that has evolved over time.\n\n35:14.620 --> 35:19.620\n And the establishment of the Austrian school per se\n\n35:20.300 --> 35:23.500\n came in 1871, 150 years ago,\n\n35:23.500 --> 35:25.500\n when Karl Menger, the father of the school,\n\n35:25.500 --> 35:28.100\n wrote a book called Principles of Economics\n\n35:28.100 --> 35:30.820\n and essentially invented marginal analysis,\n\n35:30.820 --> 35:32.780\n which is a big deal in economics.\n\n35:32.780 --> 35:35.300\n Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics,\n\n35:35.300 --> 35:37.780\n individuals carry out decisions at the margin,\n\n35:37.780 --> 35:42.660\n that it's, when you make choice, you're not making it.\n\n35:42.660 --> 35:43.980\n For instance, if you're making a choice\n\n35:43.980 --> 35:46.740\n between what should I spend my money on,\n\n35:46.740 --> 35:49.700\n you're not making a choice whether it is,\n\n35:49.700 --> 35:51.820\n this thing is object A or B,\n\n35:51.820 --> 35:53.820\n which one is more valuable for me in general,\n\n35:53.820 --> 35:56.740\n which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.\n\n35:56.740 --> 35:59.380\n You're choosing about the next unit right now\n\n35:59.380 --> 36:00.900\n at this point, at this stage.\n\n36:00.900 --> 36:04.060\n And if you analyze economic decision making at the margin,\n\n36:04.060 --> 36:05.980\n it makes a lot more sense and you can understand\n\n36:05.980 --> 36:08.740\n why people decide and make the decisions that they do.\n\n36:09.660 --> 36:12.540\n Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis,\n\n36:12.540 --> 36:14.300\n things don't make sense.\n\n36:14.300 --> 36:17.220\n The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve\n\n36:17.220 --> 36:19.780\n is what is called the water diamond paradox.\n\n36:19.780 --> 36:22.220\n So you will die without water.\n\n36:22.220 --> 36:25.820\n We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap.\n\n36:25.820 --> 36:29.260\n Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous,\n\n36:29.260 --> 36:30.940\n nobody needs them.\n\n36:30.940 --> 36:33.660\n Nobody is gonna live or die because they have a diamond\n\n36:33.660 --> 36:35.460\n and yet they're extremely expensive.\n\n36:35.460 --> 36:37.020\n So why is it that as human beings,\n\n36:37.020 --> 36:41.660\n we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,\n\n36:41.660 --> 36:43.140\n whereas we pay thousands of dollars\n\n36:43.140 --> 36:44.940\n for a few grams of diamonds.\n\n36:44.940 --> 36:46.140\n Why is this the case?\n\n36:46.140 --> 36:49.260\n Do we value water less than diamond?\n\n36:49.260 --> 36:53.940\n The answer is no, but at the margin where we are right now,\n\n36:53.940 --> 36:55.860\n you live in a place where water is very abundant\n\n36:55.860 --> 36:57.900\n because cities are only built in places\n\n36:57.900 --> 36:59.620\n where water is abundant.\n\n36:59.620 --> 37:03.500\n And you're only making a choice\n\n37:03.500 --> 37:05.300\n about the next unit of water.\n\n37:05.300 --> 37:07.260\n And so water is extremely abundant\n\n37:07.260 --> 37:10.380\n and you're choosing about whether to spend\n\n37:10.380 --> 37:14.580\n the next unit of money on water.\n\n37:14.580 --> 37:16.420\n The valuation that you give to water,\n\n37:16.420 --> 37:18.900\n given that you have a lot of water at home\n\n37:18.900 --> 37:21.420\n and that you live in a place that has abundant water\n\n37:21.420 --> 37:24.660\n is pretty low to the marginal unit,\n\n37:24.660 --> 37:26.940\n but it's very high for water overall.\n\n37:26.940 --> 37:28.420\n So if I asked you,\n\n37:28.420 --> 37:31.980\n how much would you spend for water in general?\n\n37:31.980 --> 37:34.940\n How much would you pay for water for all of your life?\n\n37:34.940 --> 37:36.980\n It would be a lot higher than diamonds.\n\n37:36.980 --> 37:39.180\n If I told you, you can only have water or diamonds\n\n37:39.180 --> 37:40.500\n for the rest of your life.\n\n37:40.500 --> 37:42.340\n You choose water, obviously,\n\n37:42.340 --> 37:44.940\n but nobody's ever had to make that choice.\n\n37:44.940 --> 37:47.220\n You only make your choices at the margin.\n\n37:47.220 --> 37:50.300\n So at the margin where we are, modern civilization,\n\n37:50.300 --> 37:51.540\n we have an abundance of water.\n\n37:51.540 --> 37:53.100\n That's why we have civilization\n\n37:53.100 --> 37:54.980\n and diamonds are very rare and scarce.\n\n37:54.980 --> 37:58.340\n And people are only buying,\n\n37:58.340 --> 38:01.780\n you buy your first diamond when you're gonna get married,\n\n38:01.780 --> 38:03.260\n you give it to your wife\n\n38:03.260 --> 38:06.660\n and that's gonna be the first few grams of diamond\n\n38:06.660 --> 38:07.500\n that she's ever gonna own.\n\n38:07.500 --> 38:09.980\n Giving my wife water.\n\n38:09.980 --> 38:10.820\n Smart move.\n\n38:10.820 --> 38:13.180\n You should definitely give her Bitcoin instead of diamonds.\n\n38:13.180 --> 38:15.660\n I tell my wife, I occasionally remind her\n\n38:15.660 --> 38:18.100\n of how many Bitcoin we could have had\n\n38:18.100 --> 38:20.300\n if I bought her Bitcoin with the price of the diamond ring.\n\n38:20.300 --> 38:22.580\n What's the downside of, by the way, diamonds\n\n38:22.580 --> 38:25.620\n from the analysis of like gold and so on?\n\n38:25.620 --> 38:27.020\n Ah, that's a great question.\n\n38:28.420 --> 38:30.060\n Arguably, diamonds are a scam.\n\n38:30.060 --> 38:35.060\n Because they became popular as a thing in marriage\n\n38:37.500 --> 38:39.060\n after gold was banned,\n\n38:39.060 --> 38:41.780\n after gold ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s\n\n38:41.780 --> 38:43.460\n and in many places around the world.\n\n38:43.460 --> 38:44.900\n So before that, you'd give gold.\n\n38:44.900 --> 38:49.380\n And the reason you'd give gold in a dowry, in a wedding\n\n38:49.380 --> 38:52.500\n is because it wasn't just that it's pretty and shiny,\n\n38:52.500 --> 38:53.700\n it's because it's money.\n\n38:53.700 --> 38:58.060\n And so if you die, your wife can take the gold\n\n38:58.060 --> 39:00.460\n and she can live off of it.\n\n39:00.460 --> 39:01.860\n It's a demonstration that you're giving her\n\n39:01.860 --> 39:03.180\n something valuable.\n\n39:03.180 --> 39:05.820\n And that's because nobody can make a lot more gold.\n\n39:05.820 --> 39:07.140\n It has the high stock to flow ratio.\n\n39:07.140 --> 39:09.700\n But then they banned gold ownership,\n\n39:09.700 --> 39:11.100\n or they allowed people to only own\n\n39:11.100 --> 39:12.780\n very tiny quantities of gold.\n\n39:12.780 --> 39:15.420\n And that's when the diamond industry stepped in\n\n39:15.420 --> 39:19.940\n and marketed diamonds as the thing that you need to give.\n\n39:19.940 --> 39:21.500\n But the problem with it is, of course,\n\n39:21.500 --> 39:23.780\n that the diamonds aren't like gold.\n\n39:23.780 --> 39:27.100\n They're not very hard to make more of.\n\n39:27.100 --> 39:29.700\n And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds\n\n39:29.700 --> 39:30.580\n is really artificial.\n\n39:30.580 --> 39:34.420\n There's effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.\n\n39:34.420 --> 39:36.580\n They restrict the supply.\n\n39:36.580 --> 39:39.060\n And it's a pretty dirty business.\n\n39:39.060 --> 39:40.300\n And the way that they do it is,\n\n39:40.300 --> 39:44.140\n all of the talk about blood diamonds\n\n39:44.140 --> 39:46.300\n is a way for them to ensure their monopoly.\n\n39:46.300 --> 39:51.180\n So if you're part of the monopoly of diamond producers,\n\n39:51.180 --> 39:53.340\n then it doesn't matter how many people get killed\n\n39:53.340 --> 39:54.420\n producing your diamonds.\n\n39:54.420 --> 39:55.860\n If you're out of the monopoly,\n\n39:55.860 --> 39:58.620\n then human rights organizations descend on you\n\n39:58.620 --> 40:02.180\n and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.\n\n40:02.180 --> 40:03.180\n And they're also restricting\n\n40:03.180 --> 40:04.460\n the production of artificial diamonds.\n\n40:04.460 --> 40:05.300\n This is the other thing.\n\n40:05.300 --> 40:06.420\n You can make artificial diamond,\n\n40:06.420 --> 40:08.420\n you can't make artificial gold.\n\n40:08.420 --> 40:11.060\n So they restrict the production of artificial diamond\n\n40:11.060 --> 40:13.500\n and they try and insist that, you know,\n\n40:13.500 --> 40:15.420\n you shouldn't take artificial diamonds,\n\n40:15.420 --> 40:18.820\n but they're indistinguishable from real diamonds.\n\n40:18.820 --> 40:20.340\n So it's an artificial scarcity.\n\n40:20.340 --> 40:22.140\n And I think there's gonna come a point at some point\n\n40:22.140 --> 40:23.380\n that this monopoly is gonna break.\n\n40:23.380 --> 40:27.180\n And a lot of people are gonna be left with essentially\n\n40:28.460 --> 40:30.540\n highly devalued jewelry.\n\n40:30.540 --> 40:32.780\n I'm gonna take this segment of the podcast,\n\n40:32.780 --> 40:34.580\n when I'm getting married, when the sun's up,\n\n40:34.580 --> 40:38.660\n and then instead you're getting water or Bitcoin.\n\n40:38.660 --> 40:40.660\n Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.\n\n40:40.660 --> 40:44.140\n So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin\n\n40:44.140 --> 40:45.380\n is the thing that allows you\n\n40:45.380 --> 40:47.900\n to most accurately capture human nature,\n\n40:47.900 --> 40:50.820\n the actual day to day decisions that we humans make.\n\n40:50.820 --> 40:55.620\n Yeah, that's really revolutionized economics, so 1870.\n\n40:55.620 --> 40:59.180\n And that was Menger's work.\n\n40:59.180 --> 41:02.580\n And then he had a student, Eugen Bomberg,\n\n41:02.580 --> 41:05.020\n who developed capital theory.\n\n41:05.020 --> 41:07.060\n And then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises,\n\n41:07.060 --> 41:10.620\n who is arguably the most important economist ever.\n\n41:10.620 --> 41:12.620\n And he developed theory of money.\n\n41:12.620 --> 41:14.980\n And he wrote a book in 1912\n\n41:14.980 --> 41:17.420\n called The Theory of Money and Credit.\n\n41:17.420 --> 41:20.180\n And then in the 40s, he wrote Human Action,\n\n41:20.180 --> 41:23.300\n which is a big treatise on economics.\n\n41:23.300 --> 41:27.340\n And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.\n\n41:27.340 --> 41:32.340\n And before World War I, this was just known as economics.\n\n41:32.340 --> 41:35.580\n And then after what happened in World War I,\n\n41:35.580 --> 41:37.740\n and I discussed this in detail in the Fiat Standard,\n\n41:37.740 --> 41:42.220\n is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold\n\n41:42.220 --> 41:45.220\n and tried to pass off their own credit\n\n41:45.220 --> 41:49.780\n as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.\n\n41:49.780 --> 41:51.380\n And incidentally here,\n\n41:51.380 --> 41:54.060\n this is part of the history that is not discussed often.\n\n41:54.060 --> 41:56.340\n This is presented as an innovation.\n\n41:57.340 --> 42:00.860\n Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school\n\n42:00.860 --> 42:03.260\n that would justify what they did.\n\n42:03.260 --> 42:05.420\n And later on, it's presented as,\n\n42:05.420 --> 42:08.180\n oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good.\n\n42:08.180 --> 42:10.700\n And now look, we've built this thing\n\n42:10.700 --> 42:11.860\n that is better than gold,\n\n42:11.860 --> 42:13.500\n where now the government can just print money\n\n42:13.500 --> 42:14.380\n whenever it wants.\n\n42:14.380 --> 42:17.980\n And now gold money is not an issue anymore,\n\n42:17.980 --> 42:20.060\n which is extremely idiotic\n\n42:20.060 --> 42:22.140\n because the whole point of money\n\n42:22.140 --> 42:23.380\n is that it's not easy to make.\n\n42:23.380 --> 42:24.900\n If it's easy to make, it's not money anymore.\n\n42:24.900 --> 42:27.500\n It's just destroying the entire function of money.\n\n42:27.500 --> 42:28.980\n And we've seen that happen extensively\n\n42:28.980 --> 42:30.380\n in the 20th century\n\n42:30.380 --> 42:32.860\n after countries went off the gold standard.\n\n42:32.860 --> 42:35.060\n So essentially Keynesian economics\n\n42:35.060 --> 42:36.660\n is just inflation apologia.\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:39.940\n It's just propaganda to justify inflationism.\n\n42:39.940 --> 42:43.180\n And it's profoundly nonsensical.\n\n42:43.180 --> 42:47.220\n It's built on the idea that if you just make more money,\n\n42:47.220 --> 42:49.460\n you can stimulate economic production.\n\n42:49.460 --> 42:51.420\n And of course, this is very self serving\n\n42:51.420 --> 42:53.180\n to the central banks and to the banks\n\n42:53.180 --> 42:56.260\n and to the governments who promote this nonsense.\n\n42:56.260 --> 42:58.700\n And this is also very pervasive.\n\n42:58.700 --> 43:01.300\n If you've had the misfortune of studying at a university\n\n43:01.300 --> 43:02.740\n over the last century,\n\n43:02.740 --> 43:04.860\n you were taught Keynesian garbage economics.\n\n43:04.860 --> 43:09.020\n You were taught that if there's a problem in the economy,\n\n43:09.020 --> 43:11.580\n the way to fix it is that the government prints money,\n\n43:11.580 --> 43:13.420\n the government lowers the interest rate,\n\n43:13.420 --> 43:17.300\n and then that leads to more economic production,\n\n43:17.300 --> 43:18.860\n which is completely nonsensical.\n\n43:18.860 --> 43:23.460\n So you're, again, for the listener,\n\n43:23.460 --> 43:26.220\n you're using strong words, you know, push back\n\n43:26.220 --> 43:30.420\n just to find, to please devil's advocate\n\n43:30.420 --> 43:33.380\n to hopefully one day arrive at the truth.\n\n43:33.380 --> 43:37.020\n So just because it's in the interest\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:38.980\n of the central banks and the government,\n\n43:38.980 --> 43:43.860\n the interests and the models of Keynesian economics\n\n43:43.860 --> 43:47.460\n and the government are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong.\n\n43:47.460 --> 43:49.860\n So let's give them a chance.\n\n43:49.860 --> 43:54.260\n So the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom,\n\n43:54.260 --> 43:58.420\n is that inflation is good in moderation\n\n43:58.420 --> 44:00.060\n as it encourages spending,\n\n44:00.060 --> 44:03.720\n but too much is bad because it completely devalues,\n\n44:03.720 --> 44:05.260\n destroys people's savings.\n\n44:05.260 --> 44:09.080\n So a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.\n\n44:09.080 --> 44:13.160\n And I mean, I suppose this is one of the things\n\n44:13.160 --> 44:17.100\n that's supported by Keynesian economics.\n\n44:17.100 --> 44:17.940\n Why is that wrong?\n\n44:17.940 --> 44:19.620\n This is basically the whole point of Keynesian economics,\n\n44:19.620 --> 44:23.420\n is to try and find an endless array of explanations\n\n44:23.420 --> 44:25.780\n to explain why inflation is a good thing.\n\n44:25.780 --> 44:28.340\n Well, the chicken and the egg.\n\n44:28.340 --> 44:30.540\n So that's the cynical take.\n\n44:30.540 --> 44:32.000\n This is a propaganda machine\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.060\n to sell the government's narrative.\n\n44:34.060 --> 44:36.860\n The less cynical take is there's a bunch of economists\n\n44:36.860 --> 44:38.900\n who are telling, who...\n\n44:38.900 --> 44:39.820\n Who figured out this thing\n\n44:39.820 --> 44:42.380\n and it happens to be good for banks and governments.\n\n44:42.380 --> 44:43.860\n Just because it's good for them doesn't mean...\n\n44:43.860 --> 44:45.980\n And it justifies the existence of government\n\n44:45.980 --> 44:50.620\n and your basic, I don't think it's your basic assumption,\n\n44:50.620 --> 44:53.660\n but a foundational principle of your thought\n\n44:53.660 --> 44:56.660\n is that a lot of government is not a good thing.\n\n44:56.660 --> 45:00.440\n Your first gut instinct, government bad.\n\n45:00.440 --> 45:02.940\n Like I mentioned, I live next door to Michael Malice,\n\n45:02.940 --> 45:07.140\n who probably beats you on the intensity\n\n45:07.140 --> 45:10.060\n and how quickly he says government bad.\n\n45:10.060 --> 45:15.060\n So there's a potential argument for government good.\n\n45:16.380 --> 45:17.460\n Some government is good.\n\n45:17.460 --> 45:19.040\n Maybe a lot of government is good.\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:22.280\n Maybe we need a lot of centralized management\n\n45:22.280 --> 45:23.900\n for resource allocation and so on\n\n45:23.900 --> 45:26.940\n because we humans specialize, we're too busy and so on.\n\n45:26.940 --> 45:30.020\n So there's an argument for that that exists.\n\n45:30.020 --> 45:32.220\n You probably disagree with any possible argument\n\n45:32.220 --> 45:33.260\n on that side, but anyway,\n\n45:33.260 --> 45:36.820\n so why is that idea of Keynesian economics wrong?\n\n45:36.820 --> 45:39.560\n I'm gonna focus for this on the money idea,\n\n45:39.560 --> 45:42.380\n the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.\n\n45:42.380 --> 45:46.260\n The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that\n\n45:46.260 --> 45:48.300\n without inflation, people wouldn't spend\n\n45:48.300 --> 45:50.940\n and then the economy would come to a grinding halt.\n\n45:50.940 --> 45:53.220\n And that's nonsensical because people spend\n\n45:53.220 --> 45:56.080\n not because they wanna keep this magical monster\n\n45:56.080 --> 45:58.060\n called the economy going.\n\n45:58.060 --> 45:59.940\n People spend because they need to consume\n\n45:59.940 --> 46:02.600\n because that's how we live, that's how we survive.\n\n46:02.600 --> 46:04.360\n You need to eat, you need shelter,\n\n46:04.360 --> 46:06.540\n you need clothes to keep you warm.\n\n46:06.540 --> 46:09.620\n And as technology advances, the capabilities\n\n46:09.620 --> 46:14.620\n of the things that we can do with our time increases\n\n46:14.840 --> 46:16.680\n and so we wanna buy more things.\n\n46:16.680 --> 46:19.420\n So people buy things because people want to consume.\n\n46:19.420 --> 46:21.780\n There's a limitless desire to consume,\n\n46:21.780 --> 46:26.780\n that there's no shortage of reasons for people to consume,\n\n46:26.780 --> 46:28.820\n shortage of reasons for people to consume,\n\n46:28.820 --> 46:33.380\n whether it's food or Ferraris or private jets.\n\n46:33.380 --> 46:35.340\n People just always wanna buy more.\n\n46:35.340 --> 46:36.980\n Can I interrupt just really quick?\n\n46:36.980 --> 46:40.040\n What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future\n\n46:40.040 --> 46:45.040\n where they might want to buy things\n\n46:45.940 --> 46:48.140\n but they're really afraid because it seems like\n\n46:48.140 --> 46:50.340\n there's a lot like a pandemic going on or whatever it is.\n\n46:50.340 --> 46:51.700\n Yeah, that's good.\n\n46:51.700 --> 46:55.740\n So fear of uncertainty, can you have too much fear?\n\n46:55.740 --> 46:57.660\n Here's the thing, what I was saying is,\n\n46:57.660 --> 47:00.460\n I was making the point that we don't need\n\n47:00.460 --> 47:02.140\n to be motivated to consume.\n\n47:02.140 --> 47:05.180\n Like we have the insatiable desire to consume.\n\n47:05.180 --> 47:08.520\n Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.\n\n47:08.520 --> 47:10.420\n Everybody would like to have a bigger house.\n\n47:10.420 --> 47:12.300\n Well, not everybody, some people have a big enough house\n\n47:12.300 --> 47:14.220\n but everybody would like a house,\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:18.780\n everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things,\n\n47:18.780 --> 47:20.920\n electronics, machines.\n\n47:20.920 --> 47:23.940\n So we don't need a desire to consume.\n\n47:23.940 --> 47:26.500\n But of course the limit on how much we consume\n\n47:26.500 --> 47:29.300\n is opportunity cost.\n\n47:29.300 --> 47:30.820\n Why don't you buy a Ferrari?\n\n47:30.820 --> 47:32.300\n Well, because that's really expensive\n\n47:32.300 --> 47:35.140\n and it would mean that, well, maybe you do have a Ferrari\n\n47:35.140 --> 47:36.860\n but I mean, most people don't buy a Ferrari\n\n47:36.860 --> 47:39.860\n because it's too expensive, they can't afford it.\n\n47:39.860 --> 47:41.820\n They'd have to work too hard to get it.\n\n47:41.820 --> 47:45.100\n And if they do get it, it might mean that\n\n47:45.100 --> 47:46.500\n they can't afford their house anymore.\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:49.680\n So we have to economize, that's a good thing.\n\n47:49.680 --> 47:51.920\n And we have to also think of the future.\n\n47:51.920 --> 47:54.180\n And so humans consume,\n\n47:54.180 --> 47:57.080\n we don't need more motivation to consume.\n\n47:57.080 --> 47:59.500\n We have to deal with the economic reality\n\n47:59.500 --> 48:02.980\n of the things that limit us from consuming more.\n\n48:02.980 --> 48:06.700\n So what Keynesians present is that\n\n48:06.700 --> 48:08.660\n when there is a problem in the economy,\n\n48:08.660 --> 48:10.540\n like there was after World War I,\n\n48:11.700 --> 48:16.700\n the problem is always caused by the inflation.\n\n48:17.180 --> 48:18.860\n And what the Keynesian hucksters do\n\n48:18.860 --> 48:21.380\n is that they look at the inflation,\n\n48:21.380 --> 48:23.260\n at the consequences of inflation\n\n48:23.260 --> 48:25.580\n and blame it on people not spending enough.\n\n48:25.580 --> 48:27.340\n When people are doing the rational thing,\n\n48:27.340 --> 48:30.500\n the money is, so there was inflation,\n\n48:30.500 --> 48:34.380\n caused an unsustainable boom, it caused the recession.\n\n48:34.380 --> 48:36.060\n And now a lot of people lost their jobs\n\n48:36.060 --> 48:37.020\n and they don't have enough money\n\n48:37.020 --> 48:39.940\n to go out and spend frivolously.\n\n48:39.940 --> 48:42.740\n So they save for the future, the future is uncertain.\n\n48:42.740 --> 48:46.380\n That's a good thing, that's how you fix things.\n\n48:46.380 --> 48:49.900\n You begin the recovery by, well, you lost some wealth,\n\n48:49.900 --> 48:52.780\n so you spend less, like if your business goes bust,\n\n48:52.780 --> 48:56.020\n if you lose your job, it's natural and smart\n\n48:56.020 --> 48:57.740\n that you stop spending money\n\n48:57.740 --> 49:00.180\n on the frivolous thing that you used to spend\n\n49:00.180 --> 49:01.500\n and you save it for the future.\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:04.220\n You invest in something else, you get a new job.\n\n49:04.220 --> 49:06.380\n And then once you've recovered, you start spending more.\n\n49:06.380 --> 49:08.900\n This is very sane and very good\n\n49:08.900 --> 49:11.300\n and it's the way to recovery.\n\n49:11.300 --> 49:14.660\n But essentially the Keynesians have used this\n\n49:14.660 --> 49:17.460\n as a justification for more inflation\n\n49:17.460 --> 49:19.340\n because inflation is an addiction.\n\n49:19.340 --> 49:21.300\n Once the government gets down the path\n\n49:21.300 --> 49:23.780\n of spending money to solve its problems,\n\n49:23.780 --> 49:26.860\n then every problem looks like it can be solved\n\n49:26.860 --> 49:27.820\n by more inflation.\n\n49:27.820 --> 49:31.420\n And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in.\n\n49:31.420 --> 49:33.300\n And of course, the Keynesian economics\n\n49:34.220 --> 49:38.980\n is based on the work of Keynes, which came in the 1930s.\n\n49:38.980 --> 49:40.100\n And this is the key point,\n\n49:40.100 --> 49:42.740\n like it's portrayed in the textbook\n\n49:42.740 --> 49:46.620\n as if it's just the scientific breakthrough\n\n49:46.620 --> 49:49.300\n that somebody in the 1930s, this genius,\n\n49:49.300 --> 49:50.860\n came about and realized that,\n\n49:50.860 --> 49:53.260\n oh, we don't actually need gold.\n\n49:53.260 --> 49:54.260\n We don't need hard money.\n\n49:54.260 --> 49:56.620\n We can actually just print all the money.\n\n49:56.620 --> 50:00.620\n And in reality, of course, it was just the very thin,\n\n50:00.620 --> 50:02.500\n flimsy, idiotic justification\n\n50:02.500 --> 50:05.100\n for what governments were already doing for 20 years.\n\n50:05.100 --> 50:07.580\n They'd already gone off the gold standard\n\n50:07.580 --> 50:09.900\n and they'd gone through 20 years\n\n50:09.900 --> 50:11.900\n in which they were lying to their population,\n\n50:11.900 --> 50:14.020\n telling their population we're still on a gold standard,\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:18.460\n but there are problems caused by various random things.\n\n50:18.460 --> 50:20.100\n But don't worry, we're gonna be going back\n\n50:20.100 --> 50:20.940\n on the gold standard.\n\n50:20.940 --> 50:23.980\n 20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,\n\n50:23.980 --> 50:27.060\n they come up with this justification for why,\n\n50:27.060 --> 50:29.860\n oh, actually the gold standard was bad.\n\n50:29.860 --> 50:32.900\n And this is a really pernicious thing about it is\n\n50:32.900 --> 50:34.500\n the problems that were caused by us\n\n50:34.500 --> 50:36.380\n going off the gold standard\n\n50:36.380 --> 50:39.020\n were caused by the gold standard.\n\n50:39.020 --> 50:40.620\n And we're going to fix them\n\n50:40.620 --> 50:42.820\n by going off the gold standard even more.\n\n50:42.820 --> 50:45.900\n Just because government is lying and it's shady\n\n50:45.900 --> 50:47.220\n and it does these kinds of things\n\n50:47.220 --> 50:49.660\n doesn't mean Keynesian economics is wrong.\n\n50:49.660 --> 50:53.100\n So just, because I wanted to separate a few things you said.\n\n50:53.100 --> 50:55.260\n It could very well be very wrong\n\n50:55.260 --> 50:57.020\n and they could indeed be hucksters.\n\n50:57.020 --> 51:00.820\n All of these, such colorful language.\n\n51:00.820 --> 51:03.260\n I love you deeply for this, this is fun.\n\n51:03.260 --> 51:05.300\n Yeah, but I mean, it's like somebody like Krugman\n\n51:05.300 --> 51:07.940\n doesn't use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.\n\n51:07.940 --> 51:10.700\n It's just that when actors like him use it,\n\n51:10.700 --> 51:13.220\n it's presented as if it is legitimate\n\n51:13.220 --> 51:15.620\n because he's part of the major shows.\n\n51:15.620 --> 51:20.620\n So the case they make and the criticism Keynesians make\n\n51:22.100 --> 51:24.820\n of Austrian economics and the case they make\n\n51:24.820 --> 51:28.180\n for Keynesian economics is it's based on empirical evidence.\n\n51:28.180 --> 51:33.180\n So Austrian economists are pie in the sky theorists\n\n51:33.660 --> 51:37.340\n about like how human nature works.\n\n51:37.340 --> 51:39.460\n And it's just all theory.\n\n51:39.460 --> 51:41.540\n And just like you said, Keynesian economics\n\n51:41.540 --> 51:44.780\n kind of sell it as a science, data driven science.\n\n51:44.780 --> 51:49.100\n And so where's the data, bro?\n\n51:50.580 --> 51:55.580\n So one way of saying it is how do you know\n\n51:55.660 --> 51:57.980\n if we get rid of inflation?\n\n51:57.980 --> 52:00.020\n How do you know if we get rid of central banks?\n\n52:00.020 --> 52:01.740\n If we push towards that direction,\n\n52:02.620 --> 52:06.740\n we will have a better world, a better functioning economy,\n\n52:06.740 --> 52:10.900\n better functioning markets, better functioning society.\n\n52:10.900 --> 52:14.620\n This is another inaccurate way in which they present.\n\n52:14.620 --> 52:16.620\n The economics, they present as if it's just theory\n\n52:16.620 --> 52:19.780\n and that the data doesn't matter, but that's not the case.\n\n52:19.780 --> 52:23.140\n What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory,\n\n52:23.140 --> 52:26.460\n data is mute, data is dumb, data can't say anything.\n\n52:26.460 --> 52:31.180\n So theory first, and then you have to have models\n\n52:32.620 --> 52:35.940\n to provide context for interpretation of the data.\n\n52:35.940 --> 52:38.780\n And it's a sign of just how little self awareness they have\n\n52:38.780 --> 52:42.260\n that they think that they're just being led by the data\n\n52:42.260 --> 52:46.460\n when they're being led by Keynes's moronic theories.\n\n52:47.300 --> 52:50.900\n And they use the data to justify those theories\n\n52:50.900 --> 52:52.380\n and to stick by them.\n\n52:52.380 --> 52:54.980\n And in fact, they are the ones whose theories\n\n52:54.980 --> 52:58.460\n cannot be refuted because it's just\n\n52:58.460 --> 53:00.380\n government mandated religion.\n\n53:00.380 --> 53:03.060\n So according to Keynes's nonsense,\n\n53:06.100 --> 53:10.660\n so the way that they justify the inflationism is this,\n\n53:10.660 --> 53:12.380\n and I'm just using this to give an example\n\n53:12.380 --> 53:14.580\n of what you're talking about in terms of theory,\n\n53:14.580 --> 53:15.980\n the way they justify the inflationism\n\n53:15.980 --> 53:17.780\n to tie it back to the original point,\n\n53:17.780 --> 53:20.100\n they justified it, all right, we need money to spend.\n\n53:20.100 --> 53:22.140\n And then the level of spending in the economy\n\n53:22.140 --> 53:23.700\n is what determines the state of the economy.\n\n53:23.700 --> 53:25.140\n And I've taught macro economics\n\n53:25.140 --> 53:26.460\n at university level for a while.\n\n53:26.460 --> 53:31.300\n So I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians\n\n53:31.300 --> 53:34.260\n know Austrians, if not all of them, I guarantee you.\n\n53:34.260 --> 53:38.180\n And so the way they see it is the level of spending\n\n53:38.180 --> 53:40.380\n in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.\n\n53:40.380 --> 53:42.660\n There's a level of output and there's a level of spending.\n\n53:42.660 --> 53:44.420\n So there's like the factories on the one side\n\n53:44.420 --> 53:45.940\n that are churning out goods,\n\n53:45.940 --> 53:48.740\n and those goods have a certain quantity and value,\n\n53:48.740 --> 53:51.660\n market value, and it's completely nonsensical of course,\n\n53:51.660 --> 53:54.820\n because how can the value of the goods produced\n\n53:54.820 --> 53:56.660\n be different from the value of the spending?\n\n53:56.660 --> 53:59.020\n But let's put that aside for a second.\n\n54:00.060 --> 54:02.420\n So the amount of spending that happens in the economy\n\n54:02.420 --> 54:04.100\n determines the state of the economy.\n\n54:04.100 --> 54:07.820\n If the value of the production, which they call Y\n\n54:07.820 --> 54:10.340\n is higher than the aggregate expenditures,\n\n54:10.340 --> 54:11.300\n so this is the production\n\n54:11.300 --> 54:13.420\n and then the aggregate expenditure is lower,\n\n54:13.420 --> 54:16.700\n then we don't have enough spending to buy all the goods.\n\n54:16.700 --> 54:18.220\n And then that causes a recession.\n\n54:18.220 --> 54:20.740\n The factories start laying off workers\n\n54:20.740 --> 54:23.300\n and then the laid off workers start spending less.\n\n54:23.300 --> 54:25.500\n And then that leads to aggregate expenditure\n\n54:25.500 --> 54:26.940\n dropping even further.\n\n54:26.940 --> 54:28.300\n And so it's a vicious cycle\n\n54:28.300 --> 54:30.540\n where the economy gets into recession.\n\n54:30.540 --> 54:33.980\n And the only way out is for Keynes's bankster buddies\n\n54:33.980 --> 54:36.060\n and government buddies to print a lot of money\n\n54:36.060 --> 54:37.460\n to give to themselves.\n\n54:37.460 --> 54:39.460\n And then that will...\n\n54:39.460 --> 54:40.740\n That's one interpretation.\n\n54:40.740 --> 54:44.900\n But to print more money to increase the expenditure\n\n54:44.900 --> 54:46.260\n that to match the supply.\n\n54:46.260 --> 54:47.380\n To match the level of output.\n\n54:47.380 --> 54:49.180\n Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold.\n\n54:49.180 --> 54:50.820\n All right.\n\n54:50.820 --> 54:52.620\n Even though you're saying huckster, so.\n\n54:52.620 --> 54:53.460\n Yes.\n\n54:53.460 --> 54:56.500\n I just, you know, the way, I love you very much,\n\n54:56.500 --> 54:59.660\n but like just for people who are listening,\n\n54:59.660 --> 55:03.700\n I think it's, I love the way you talk and it's great\n\n55:03.700 --> 55:05.900\n and keep doing it, but just for context,\n\n55:05.900 --> 55:10.860\n like I don't know anything that involves human nature\n\n55:10.860 --> 55:12.460\n deserves this level of certainty.\n\n55:12.460 --> 55:15.300\n I, at least my position is that we don't know\n\n55:15.300 --> 55:18.180\n what the hell we're doing on basically anything.\n\n55:18.180 --> 55:19.300\n Perhaps, but I mean.\n\n55:19.300 --> 55:23.740\n Like there's a lot, like certainty can get us in trouble\n\n55:23.740 --> 55:24.580\n is my worry.\n\n55:24.580 --> 55:27.180\n I don't know much about economics.\n\n55:27.180 --> 55:29.500\n I don't even know, you know, financial systems,\n\n55:29.500 --> 55:33.980\n monetary systems, but I just seen us get in trouble\n\n55:33.980 --> 55:36.260\n with human psychology, certainty,\n\n55:36.260 --> 55:38.380\n certainty of ideologies in general.\n\n55:38.380 --> 55:40.340\n You mentioned Marxism and so on.\n\n55:40.340 --> 55:42.180\n I came from the Soviet Union.\n\n55:42.180 --> 55:44.460\n There's a lot of people that are very certain\n\n55:44.460 --> 55:46.580\n throughout the history of the 20th century\n\n55:46.580 --> 55:51.580\n that communism is the utopia that humanity should strive for.\n\n55:52.540 --> 55:54.380\n So I'm nervous around certainty.\n\n55:54.380 --> 55:57.220\n I could be wrong, but you know, you ask me for my opinion.\n\n55:57.220 --> 55:58.060\n Yes, yes.\n\n55:58.060 --> 56:00.220\n Sorry, so it's that little bit of a caveat.\n\n56:00.220 --> 56:03.180\n So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand,\n\n56:03.180 --> 56:05.980\n you have the level of, if the other situation\n\n56:05.980 --> 56:07.740\n is when the level of spending is higher\n\n56:07.740 --> 56:09.980\n than the amount of aggregate output.\n\n56:09.980 --> 56:11.780\n In that situation, you have too much spending.\n\n56:11.780 --> 56:14.580\n So therefore what ends up happening is inflation.\n\n56:14.580 --> 56:16.100\n So according to the Keynesian worldview,\n\n56:16.100 --> 56:18.220\n this is really important because this is a way\n\n56:18.220 --> 56:20.900\n that I'm gonna get to your point about empirical data\n\n56:20.900 --> 56:25.900\n and to show you why they're not correct.\n\n56:26.540 --> 56:28.300\n Yeah, they're not correct about what they say\n\n56:28.300 --> 56:29.580\n about empirical data.\n\n56:29.580 --> 56:32.580\n So then what this means is that there's a level of output\n\n56:32.580 --> 56:34.180\n and there's a level of aggregate expenditure.\n\n56:34.180 --> 56:36.060\n The aggregate expenditure can either be higher\n\n56:36.060 --> 56:38.620\n or lower than the output or equal to it.\n\n56:38.620 --> 56:41.700\n If it's higher, we get inflation.\n\n56:41.700 --> 56:46.620\n If it's lower, we get recessions, okay?\n\n56:46.620 --> 56:50.020\n So is there any universe in this model?\n\n56:50.020 --> 56:52.180\n Is there any potential universe\n\n56:52.180 --> 56:56.300\n in which you can have both inflation and a recession?\n\n56:56.300 --> 56:59.380\n According to the Keynesian model, you can't, right?\n\n56:59.380 --> 57:02.700\n Because aggregate expenditure cannot be both higher\n\n57:02.700 --> 57:04.980\n and lower than output.\n\n57:04.980 --> 57:08.460\n So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person,\n\n57:08.460 --> 57:13.140\n if you were looking at evidence and trying to analyze data,\n\n57:13.140 --> 57:16.380\n you'd look at this and say, one example,\n\n57:16.380 --> 57:18.740\n you just need one example of high inflation\n\n57:18.740 --> 57:23.700\n and high unemployment to refute this entire model, right?\n\n57:23.700 --> 57:25.980\n And of course, the world is full of examples\n\n57:25.980 --> 57:28.140\n of high inflation and high unemployment.\n\n57:28.140 --> 57:30.020\n And that's what happened in the 19, and of course,\n\n57:30.020 --> 57:32.260\n they ignored it when it happens in poor countries\n\n57:32.260 --> 57:34.500\n because poor countries don't really matter.\n\n57:34.500 --> 57:37.180\n But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US\n\n57:37.180 --> 57:38.260\n and in the Western economies\n\n57:38.260 --> 57:40.380\n and the most advanced industrial economies.\n\n57:40.380 --> 57:42.460\n So historically, before then,\n\n57:42.460 --> 57:45.700\n you had all these Keynesian central bankers\n\n57:47.180 --> 57:48.980\n talking about this model and saying,\n\n57:48.980 --> 57:51.060\n well, aggregate expenditure is too low now\n\n57:51.060 --> 57:52.420\n and that's why we have unemployment.\n\n57:52.420 --> 57:53.580\n So we need to print more money.\n\n57:53.580 --> 57:56.500\n And then they print more money, inflation goes up,\n\n57:56.500 --> 58:01.500\n but also unemployment goes up because this model is broken.\n\n58:01.860 --> 58:04.300\n That's not how the world works.\n\n58:04.300 --> 58:06.300\n The level of aggregate spending in the economy\n\n58:06.300 --> 58:09.020\n is not a lever with which you can control\n\n58:09.020 --> 58:10.820\n inflation and unemployment.\n\n58:10.820 --> 58:12.900\n So what would a scientist do?\n\n58:12.900 --> 58:15.380\n What would a non Huckster do in this case?\n\n58:17.300 --> 58:18.660\n Admit the theory is wrong\n\n58:18.660 --> 58:21.260\n and find another way to reformulate it.\n\n58:21.260 --> 58:23.020\n Have the Keynesians done that?\n\n58:23.020 --> 58:25.540\n No, still the same garbage in the textbook\n\n58:25.540 --> 58:27.140\n that is being taught until today.\n\n58:27.140 --> 58:29.700\n So is it possible to have a non Keynesian model\n\n58:29.700 --> 58:31.980\n where one that still supports\n\n58:31.980 --> 58:34.580\n moderate amount of inflation is good for the economy?\n\n58:34.580 --> 58:37.060\n I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened,\n\n58:37.060 --> 58:42.060\n yeah, this is what basically most fiat economists,\n\n58:43.220 --> 58:44.060\n as I like to call them,\n\n58:44.060 --> 58:46.540\n essentially anybody at a university financed by governments,\n\n58:46.540 --> 58:47.860\n which is financed by central banks,\n\n58:47.860 --> 58:48.700\n which is financed by fiat.\n\n58:48.700 --> 58:50.060\n Oh, we'll talk about that.\n\n58:50.060 --> 58:53.860\n The effect of fiat money on our life,\n\n58:53.860 --> 58:56.100\n as you write about in your book,\n\n58:56.100 --> 58:58.460\n fiat standard, one of them is education.\n\n58:58.460 --> 59:00.220\n I'm sure we'll disagree there too.\n\n59:01.220 --> 59:04.020\n Not smart enough to disagree, but I'll disagree anyway.\n\n59:04.020 --> 59:06.220\n So yeah, so a whole bunch of other models came up,\n\n59:06.220 --> 59:10.660\n but basically it's such an example of motivated reasoning.\n\n59:10.660 --> 59:12.260\n Like anybody who's got a familiarity\n\n59:12.260 --> 59:13.380\n with the scientific method\n\n59:13.380 --> 59:14.900\n or who's got an engineering background\n\n59:14.900 --> 59:18.580\n who comes into economics immediately has a lot of red flags.\n\n59:18.580 --> 59:22.340\n And I remember when I used to teach macro economics,\n\n59:22.340 --> 59:24.500\n I used to teach introductory macro economics.\n\n59:24.500 --> 59:26.580\n And it's a course that would be taken by econ majors\n\n59:26.580 --> 59:27.660\n as well as engineers.\n\n59:27.660 --> 59:29.620\n A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.\n\n59:29.620 --> 59:31.060\n And every time I'd explain,\n\n59:31.060 --> 59:33.260\n and I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff.\n\n59:33.260 --> 59:34.180\n And every time I'd explain it,\n\n59:34.180 --> 59:35.980\n there's always that smart engineering kid\n\n59:35.980 --> 59:37.980\n who just looks at me and says,\n\n59:37.980 --> 59:39.620\n sir, this doesn't make any sense\n\n59:39.620 --> 59:41.260\n because this and this and that.\n\n59:41.260 --> 59:43.780\n And I'm always like, you get it exactly.\n\n59:43.780 --> 59:44.700\n You're correct.\n\n59:44.700 --> 59:47.580\n Because if you have any kind of shred of scientific thinking,\n\n59:47.580 --> 59:50.220\n you see that this is all motivated reasoning.\n\n59:50.220 --> 59:52.820\n Like the answer is government needs to print money.\n\n59:52.820 --> 59:56.740\n And here's a whole bunch of models brought up by people\n\n59:56.740 --> 59:59.100\n for why government printing money is good.\n\n59:59.100 --> 1:00:01.940\n And the reason they're coming up to this conclusion\n\n1:00:01.940 --> 1:00:03.060\n is that you only get funded\n\n1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:04.340\n if you come up with this conclusion.\n\n1:00:04.340 --> 1:00:05.260\n If you come up with a conclusion\n\n1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:08.260\n that we need to shut down the central bank,\n\n1:00:08.260 --> 1:00:10.100\n you don't get funded by the central bank.\n\n1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:11.620\n You don't get published in the journals.\n\n1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:14.540\n You don't get a job at the prestigious universities.\n\n1:00:14.540 --> 1:00:16.980\n You don't get quoted by a fiat publications\n\n1:00:16.980 --> 1:00:18.820\n like the New York Times and CNN.\n\n1:00:18.820 --> 1:00:21.340\n They don't invite you on as an expert.\n\n1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:22.540\n Well, that's a fundamental flaw\n\n1:00:22.540 --> 1:00:24.580\n with a lot of institutions we have today\n\n1:00:25.660 --> 1:00:26.980\n and throughout human history.\n\n1:00:26.980 --> 1:00:29.500\n Let me zoom off for just a second to the big question.\n\n1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:32.420\n What is economics in general?\n\n1:00:32.420 --> 1:00:33.260\n What's the goal?\n\n1:00:33.260 --> 1:00:34.940\n You said there's a bunch of models.\n\n1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:38.180\n Is any economist basically trying to throw a bunch of models\n\n1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.060\n about human behavior on the table\n\n1:00:40.060 --> 1:00:43.940\n and try to generalize it to the global scale?\n\n1:00:43.940 --> 1:00:47.060\n So both dance between micro and macro somehow\n\n1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:49.180\n in order to determine public policy\n\n1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:53.100\n and explain the past, predict the future,\n\n1:00:53.100 --> 1:00:56.940\n prescribe policies that can control the future,\n\n1:00:56.940 --> 1:00:57.900\n those kinds of things.\n\n1:00:57.900 --> 1:01:00.140\n This is the big basic ridiculous question\n\n1:01:00.140 --> 1:01:02.060\n of what is economics?\n\n1:01:02.060 --> 1:01:03.300\n Economics is the study,\n\n1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:05.380\n the way the Austrians define it is the study\n\n1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:09.100\n of how humans make choices under the condition of scarcity.\n\n1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:11.020\n We begin with the starting point of economics\n\n1:01:11.020 --> 1:01:14.100\n as the fact that scarcity exists.\n\n1:01:14.100 --> 1:01:16.500\n And why does scarcity exist?\n\n1:01:16.500 --> 1:01:18.380\n Well, because it's easier to want things\n\n1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:19.460\n than it is to make them.\n\n1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:23.300\n It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.\n\n1:01:23.300 --> 1:01:27.620\n And so because we have wants\n\n1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:30.980\n and we have limited means to meet those wants,\n\n1:01:30.980 --> 1:01:32.260\n we need to economize.\n\n1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:37.220\n It's a permanent marker of the human condition.\n\n1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:39.980\n We are always economizing at all times.\n\n1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:43.060\n And so how people make those decisions\n\n1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:45.340\n under the conditions of scarcity\n\n1:01:45.340 --> 1:01:47.500\n is what economists study.\n\n1:01:47.500 --> 1:01:49.900\n So to go back to your point on empiricism\n\n1:01:49.900 --> 1:01:51.340\n in Austrian school,\n\n1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:55.660\n so it isn't that the Austrians don't believe in data.\n\n1:01:55.660 --> 1:02:00.500\n On the contrary, it's that theory has to inform data.\n\n1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:02.460\n And in fact, if you think about it\n\n1:02:02.460 --> 1:02:06.660\n as the example of the stagflation of the 1970 shows,\n\n1:02:08.180 --> 1:02:10.620\n if you have stagflation,\n\n1:02:10.620 --> 1:02:13.460\n that just completely refutes the Keynesian model.\n\n1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:15.500\n The Austrian way of thinking,\n\n1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.860\n which is think from first principles,\n\n1:02:17.860 --> 1:02:19.860\n understand how the world actually works,\n\n1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:21.980\n think about how humans act and understand\n\n1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:23.940\n that economics is really all about human action.\n\n1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:26.620\n So it's not about aggregates of goods.\n\n1:02:26.620 --> 1:02:28.020\n This is really the key distinction\n\n1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:29.500\n in terms of methodology.\n\n1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:32.820\n For the Keynesians, it's physics envy.\n\n1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:34.340\n They look at the market economy,\n\n1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:36.700\n they look at individuals in the market economy,\n\n1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:39.220\n and they think that they can understand the market economy\n\n1:02:39.220 --> 1:02:40.780\n by looking at aggregates.\n\n1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:43.460\n This is really the key point of what I think\n\n1:02:43.460 --> 1:02:48.060\n makes a certain branch of economics pseudoscientific\n\n1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:49.780\n is the introduction of aggregates.\n\n1:02:49.780 --> 1:02:52.500\n When you introduce those aggregates,\n\n1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:54.460\n how much production takes place,\n\n1:02:54.460 --> 1:02:56.580\n how many people are unemployed,\n\n1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:59.580\n the percentage of the inflation rate,\n\n1:02:59.580 --> 1:03:01.540\n and then you think that you can establish\n\n1:03:01.540 --> 1:03:04.860\n scientific relationship between those aggregates,\n\n1:03:04.860 --> 1:03:07.500\n it's purely physics envy.\n\n1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:09.980\n In physics, for instance, or in chemistry,\n\n1:03:09.980 --> 1:03:13.900\n you put, let's say, a container that contains a gas,\n\n1:03:13.900 --> 1:03:18.380\n and you have the ideal gas law, PV equals to nRT,\n\n1:03:18.380 --> 1:03:20.940\n calculate the pressure, calculate the volume,\n\n1:03:20.940 --> 1:03:24.380\n and then the temperature.\n\n1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:25.620\n If you have the pressure and the volume,\n\n1:03:25.620 --> 1:03:26.620\n you can calculate the temperature\n\n1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:30.060\n because you have the nR constants.\n\n1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:32.740\n So there's a clear relationship\n\n1:03:32.740 --> 1:03:34.620\n that has been demonstrated in a laboratory\n\n1:03:34.620 --> 1:03:36.620\n and that we can do it right now.\n\n1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:38.260\n We can measure it and we can see it\n\n1:03:38.260 --> 1:03:40.020\n and it continues to hold.\n\n1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:42.740\n And all it takes is one scientist\n\n1:03:42.740 --> 1:03:44.820\n to show that this relationship does not hold,\n\n1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:48.020\n to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold,\n\n1:03:48.020 --> 1:03:52.780\n and it stops being a law of chemistry and it's broken.\n\n1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:56.380\n Whereas in economics, what they've done\n\n1:03:56.380 --> 1:04:00.180\n is they've copied the superficial shape of this\n\n1:04:00.180 --> 1:04:02.860\n without any of the scientific rigor\n\n1:04:02.860 --> 1:04:04.820\n that was used to build it.\n\n1:04:04.820 --> 1:04:05.860\n There's no experiments.\n\n1:04:05.860 --> 1:04:08.100\n You can't experiment on economies.\n\n1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:11.780\n We don't have the ability to establish laws,\n\n1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:13.340\n and all the laws that we establish\n\n1:04:13.340 --> 1:04:15.420\n are just models that get people published\n\n1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:18.140\n and get them on the media to say,\n\n1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:20.540\n my model says we need to print more money,\n\n1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:23.420\n but it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.\n\n1:04:23.420 --> 1:04:25.620\n If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes\n\n1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:28.180\n because the world is full of examples that contradict them.\n\n1:04:28.180 --> 1:04:30.220\n Was it possible to do scientific scrutiny\n\n1:04:30.220 --> 1:04:32.100\n when it's human nature when you can't,\n\n1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:34.660\n when there's a nearly infinite number of variables\n\n1:04:34.660 --> 1:04:36.020\n and you can't control them?\n\n1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:38.300\n Is it possible, so what's the best thing\n\n1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:40.180\n you could possibly do?\n\n1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:42.180\n You do thought experiments.\n\n1:04:43.100 --> 1:04:45.500\n But the problem with thought experiments,\n\n1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:49.820\n Freud thinks everybody wants to have sex with their mother.\n\n1:04:49.820 --> 1:04:51.780\n Is he right? That's the problem with Freud.\n\n1:04:51.780 --> 1:04:53.780\n I don't know, maybe he's right.\n\n1:04:53.780 --> 1:04:57.020\n Well, obviously I'm joking on that front, but the...\n\n1:04:57.020 --> 1:04:59.020\n Freud is probably under the canes.\n\n1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:03.660\n Well, no, I think there's power to the thought experiment.\n\n1:05:03.660 --> 1:05:06.420\n Just like Einstein, a lot of general relativity,\n\n1:05:06.420 --> 1:05:09.300\n special relativity, that's a thought experiment.\n\n1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:10.860\n It originates in a thought experiment.\n\n1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:12.080\n Now, is it true?\n\n1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:14.660\n Nice thing about physics,\n\n1:05:14.660 --> 1:05:17.420\n you can't eventually have experimental validation.\n\n1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:20.860\n The downside of economics is you really can't have\n\n1:05:20.860 --> 1:05:25.660\n experimental, definitive experimental scientific rigor\n\n1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:27.060\n of validation of a theory.\n\n1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:29.140\n So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment.\n\n1:05:29.140 --> 1:05:32.740\n Using your intuition, it's the power of reasoning together\n\n1:05:32.740 --> 1:05:33.700\n about human nature.\n\n1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:36.540\n And that's why economics cannot make the claims\n\n1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:37.380\n that physics can make.\n\n1:05:37.380 --> 1:05:40.700\n So with physics, you can predict that if you get this gas\n\n1:05:40.700 --> 1:05:42.320\n at this pressure, at this volume,\n\n1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:43.980\n the temperature will be that much.\n\n1:05:43.980 --> 1:05:47.840\n And you can make that prediction and test it a million times\n\n1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:50.340\n and you'll always get the precisely correct answer.\n\n1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:53.060\n With economics, we can't make quantitative predictions.\n\n1:05:53.060 --> 1:05:54.860\n But still, on Twitter, and even today,\n\n1:05:54.860 --> 1:05:57.820\n you're very certain about the statements you're making.\n\n1:05:57.820 --> 1:05:58.660\n Do you...\n\n1:05:58.660 --> 1:06:00.480\n Yeah, but I don't make quantitatively certain statements.\n\n1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:01.320\n That's the thing.\n\n1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:03.380\n In economics, we don't make quantitative predictions.\n\n1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:06.140\n We cannot do that because we don't have experiments.\n\n1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:09.620\n But we can understand how the world actually works\n\n1:06:09.620 --> 1:06:10.460\n with humility.\n\n1:06:10.460 --> 1:06:11.660\n This is really the key difference\n\n1:06:11.660 --> 1:06:13.940\n that the Keynesians think they just wanna copy\n\n1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:15.060\n the methods of physics.\n\n1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:18.480\n And then that's just gonna give them the certainty\n\n1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:20.340\n of the results of physics, which is like me saying,\n\n1:06:20.340 --> 1:06:23.680\n I'm just gonna put a red blanket on my back\n\n1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.180\n and jump from the fourth floor because I'm Superman.\n\n1:06:26.180 --> 1:06:27.500\n Well, it's not the red blanket\n\n1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:29.020\n that's gonna make me Superman.\n\n1:06:29.020 --> 1:06:30.180\n There's a lot more to it.\n\n1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:33.500\n So humility manifests itself in economics\n\n1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:35.580\n as the belief in a free market.\n\n1:06:35.580 --> 1:06:37.380\n Meaning like, I can't centralize,\n\n1:06:37.380 --> 1:06:41.180\n I can't do centralized control on this thing.\n\n1:06:41.180 --> 1:06:44.480\n We're going to minimize the friction\n\n1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:47.440\n of the free exchange of goods.\n\n1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:52.260\n So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.\n\n1:06:52.260 --> 1:06:55.660\n Yes, and you could arrive at it through two paths.\n\n1:06:55.660 --> 1:07:00.660\n The more practical path, which most scientific minded\n\n1:07:01.380 --> 1:07:02.260\n people arrive at.\n\n1:07:02.260 --> 1:07:03.500\n I came from an engineering background.\n\n1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:07.060\n So I initially had this idea that what is lacking\n\n1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:09.180\n in economics is mathematicization.\n\n1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:11.260\n We need to have better math models.\n\n1:07:11.260 --> 1:07:13.120\n We need to get all of those tools from engineering,\n\n1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.380\n apply them to economics, and then we'll be able\n\n1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:18.340\n to plan the world economy and make it work better.\n\n1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:21.180\n And then you start actually trying to solve problems,\n\n1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:22.340\n trying to actually calculate them.\n\n1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:24.700\n And you realize nobody can have that ability\n\n1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:28.460\n because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact\n\n1:07:28.460 --> 1:07:29.780\n we can't have experiments.\n\n1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.780\n And the reason we can't have experiments is that\n\n1:07:31.780 --> 1:07:33.900\n you can experiment on particles of a gas.\n\n1:07:33.900 --> 1:07:37.440\n You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies.\n\n1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:42.180\n And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.\n\n1:07:42.180 --> 1:07:46.020\n And so you kick matter in a certain way.\n\n1:07:46.020 --> 1:07:48.780\n You can calculate exactly how much is going to fly.\n\n1:07:48.780 --> 1:07:50.340\n Human beings are much more complex.\n\n1:07:50.340 --> 1:07:51.660\n They have a will inside them.\n\n1:07:51.660 --> 1:07:55.420\n And this is really, this is the humility to understand\n\n1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:57.140\n that you are a human being and other people\n\n1:07:57.140 --> 1:07:59.420\n are also human being just like you.\n\n1:07:59.420 --> 1:08:03.580\n And that every person wakes up every morning\n\n1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:06.420\n and they have a million things in their mind,\n\n1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:07.700\n a million things they care about,\n\n1:08:07.700 --> 1:08:09.500\n a million things they want to do.\n\n1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:13.220\n And you will never be able to make the decisions\n\n1:08:13.220 --> 1:08:16.660\n for somebody else, let alone for millions of other people.\n\n1:08:16.660 --> 1:08:18.980\n So this is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion\n\n1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.120\n that free markets are better because you realize\n\n1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:22.080\n that all of the people that think\n\n1:08:22.080 --> 1:08:24.660\n that they can centrally plan markets\n\n1:08:24.660 --> 1:08:26.900\n can't actually do that.\n\n1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:30.540\n And that there's really nothing scientific about them\n\n1:08:30.540 --> 1:08:33.100\n except essentially the rituals they ape\n\n1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:35.300\n of the scientific process.\n\n1:08:35.300 --> 1:08:38.140\n And the other path I think that makes you arrive\n\n1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:41.380\n at the Austrian perspective or the libertarian perspective\n\n1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:46.380\n I should say, is simply the notion of individuals\n\n1:08:47.020 --> 1:08:49.700\n as having their own inalienable right\n\n1:08:49.700 --> 1:08:51.820\n to decide what they want to do with themselves.\n\n1:08:51.820 --> 1:08:55.700\n If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself\n\n1:08:55.700 --> 1:09:00.700\n the idea that you get to be planner is ultimately\n\n1:09:00.740 --> 1:09:02.520\n you think you're better than other people.\n\n1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:05.820\n You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine.\n\n1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:08.060\n And I don't think that's a defensible position.\n\n1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:11.620\n I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever.\n\n1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:13.500\n I will never want to force anybody\n\n1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:15.820\n to do anything they don't want.\n\n1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:18.880\n The Keynesian perspective, the central planning perspective\n\n1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:22.660\n is unlike physics, which is let's force a bunch\n\n1:09:22.660 --> 1:09:26.100\n of particles to sit in the lab so that we can study them.\n\n1:09:26.100 --> 1:09:28.500\n In economics, you're forcing people to do things.\n\n1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:31.100\n Let's stop these people from doing this job\n\n1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:32.380\n because it's bad for the economy\n\n1:09:32.380 --> 1:09:34.040\n and let's get them to do that job.\n\n1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:35.700\n Let's force them to pay this price.\n\n1:09:35.700 --> 1:09:37.500\n Let's tax them this much.\n\n1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:39.460\n Let's prevent them from using gold as money\n\n1:09:39.460 --> 1:09:42.260\n and force them to use our credit as money.\n\n1:09:42.260 --> 1:09:44.540\n So it has to rely on coercion.\n\n1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:46.620\n There's no central planning without coercion.\n\n1:09:46.620 --> 1:09:49.180\n And coercion is a crime, in my opinion.\n\n1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:51.780\n There's no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically.\n\n1:09:51.780 --> 1:09:54.220\n So from a politics, from an ethical perspective,\n\n1:09:55.340 --> 1:09:58.020\n your view is the, I mean, perhaps the,\n\n1:09:58.020 --> 1:09:59.940\n broadly speaking, the libertarian view\n\n1:09:59.940 --> 1:10:04.940\n is coercion is unethical, freedom is essential.\n\n1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:09.940\n What is, what are the pros and cons\n\n1:10:09.940 --> 1:10:12.380\n of government intervention in the economy?\n\n1:10:12.380 --> 1:10:14.860\n So can you steal, can you provide pros?\n\n1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:19.100\n You just kind of provided arguments against.\n\n1:10:19.100 --> 1:10:20.900\n Is there any arguments to be made\n\n1:10:20.900 --> 1:10:22.580\n for government intervention,\n\n1:10:22.580 --> 1:10:25.260\n for the role of government in society?\n\n1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:28.660\n Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective,\n\n1:10:28.660 --> 1:10:31.460\n what is the positive role of government\n\n1:10:31.460 --> 1:10:33.460\n that you can imagine you can speak to?\n\n1:10:33.460 --> 1:10:34.920\n I can repeat many other cases,\n\n1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:37.020\n but I don't find any of them compelling\n\n1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:38.100\n for the reason that I mentioned,\n\n1:10:38.100 --> 1:10:41.340\n which is that ultimately they all rely on\n\n1:10:41.340 --> 1:10:42.520\n putting a gun to somebody's head\n\n1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:43.820\n and using the threat of force.\n\n1:10:43.820 --> 1:10:46.100\n So that's for me, it can never be justifiable.\n\n1:10:46.100 --> 1:10:47.940\n Whatever the ends are,\n\n1:10:47.940 --> 1:10:52.940\n if the means are violence and the threat of violence,\n\n1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:55.100\n then the ends aren't justified.\n\n1:10:55.100 --> 1:10:56.420\n Everything that's good,\n\n1:10:56.420 --> 1:10:59.900\n governments will use as an excuse to justify coercion.\n\n1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:01.500\n So, you know, what do you like?\n\n1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:03.060\n You like motherhood and apple pie?\n\n1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:04.300\n Well, government needs to ensure\n\n1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.040\n that motherhood works well,\n\n1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:09.520\n and we need the government central planning of birth.\n\n1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:11.380\n We need regulations on birth, for instance.\n\n1:11:11.380 --> 1:11:14.460\n We need regulations on how people give birth.\n\n1:11:14.460 --> 1:11:16.140\n We need to ban people from giving birth\n\n1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:18.100\n in traditional ways that have been tried\n\n1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:18.940\n for thousands of years.\n\n1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:20.980\n We need to force people to do things\n\n1:11:20.980 --> 1:11:22.820\n in the modern scientific way.\n\n1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:26.500\n Well, so what about things like that all of us use,\n\n1:11:26.500 --> 1:11:29.500\n so infrastructure, for example, or education,\n\n1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:33.540\n or, well, the economy too, right?\n\n1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.460\n Can you make a case for the role\n\n1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:42.140\n of some large scale centralized systems,\n\n1:11:42.140 --> 1:11:43.580\n whether it's government or not,\n\n1:11:43.580 --> 1:11:45.340\n that do this kind of management?\n\n1:11:45.340 --> 1:11:46.700\n I guess, perhaps you could say\n\n1:11:46.700 --> 1:11:48.840\n there's the economies of scale argument\n\n1:11:48.840 --> 1:11:52.280\n that some things must exist at a very large scale,\n\n1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:56.860\n and therefore you would want political accountability\n\n1:11:56.860 --> 1:11:58.100\n of the people who manage them.\n\n1:11:58.100 --> 1:11:59.060\n This is kind of the argument\n\n1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:01.460\n that's given for infrastructure monopolies.\n\n1:12:01.460 --> 1:12:03.680\n For instance, roads or electricity.\n\n1:12:05.780 --> 1:12:07.060\n Let's say we live in a country,\n\n1:12:07.060 --> 1:12:08.180\n we need one power plant.\n\n1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:11.180\n The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be.\n\n1:12:11.180 --> 1:12:15.020\n And there's a natural monopoly in the power plant business.\n\n1:12:15.020 --> 1:12:17.160\n So we're gonna have to have one power plant.\n\n1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.380\n And since it's only one power plant,\n\n1:12:19.380 --> 1:12:22.100\n then we can't just let anybody own it\n\n1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:24.380\n because then they're gonna make it too expensive.\n\n1:12:24.380 --> 1:12:26.240\n So we need to have the government own it\n\n1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:28.180\n so it can make it too expensive.\n\n1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:29.900\n And you don't find that case compelling?\n\n1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:30.740\n Not at all.\n\n1:12:30.740 --> 1:12:31.580\n I used to believe in it.\n\n1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:33.620\n I was pretty much a Keynesian\n\n1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:38.620\n when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia.\n\n1:12:38.620 --> 1:12:40.180\n No, I don't find that compelling at all\n\n1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:42.700\n because I think all these examples that they mention\n\n1:12:42.700 --> 1:12:45.540\n of natural monopolies or economies of scale\n\n1:12:45.540 --> 1:12:47.740\n that can only fit at a scale of government,\n\n1:12:51.220 --> 1:12:54.420\n government bans people from opening power plants.\n\n1:12:54.420 --> 1:12:56.140\n And then there's only one power plant\n\n1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:58.180\n and they need to be in charge of it.\n\n1:12:58.180 --> 1:13:01.580\n But in reality, no.\n\n1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:04.580\n In reality, power plants can exist at all kinds of manners\n\n1:13:04.580 --> 1:13:06.420\n of scales of operation.\n\n1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:08.820\n And yes, of course, there are benefits to centralization\n\n1:13:08.820 --> 1:13:10.260\n in power plants in particular\n\n1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:13.180\n because there's efficiency in generation.\n\n1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:17.100\n One big power plant is more efficient\n\n1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:20.020\n than 10 equivalent smaller power plants.\n\n1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:22.260\n But there's also inefficiencies in centralization\n\n1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:25.540\n because the more centralized and the bigger the plant is,\n\n1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:29.920\n the further away a lot of the population is going to be.\n\n1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:31.960\n So you're gonna be losing a lot of the electricity\n\n1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:33.540\n and transmission.\n\n1:13:33.540 --> 1:13:36.020\n And you believe the free market is best in managing\n\n1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:39.220\n that dance, that balance of centralization.\n\n1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:41.540\n Exactly, and if we do end up in a situation\n\n1:13:41.540 --> 1:13:44.380\n where there's one power plant for an area,\n\n1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:48.940\n then if the markets ends up centralizing all of it\n\n1:13:48.940 --> 1:13:52.780\n into one power plant, I don't see that as a problem.\n\n1:13:52.780 --> 1:13:54.860\n There are places, there's a small town\n\n1:13:54.860 --> 1:13:56.060\n with only one barber shop.\n\n1:13:56.060 --> 1:13:57.460\n Is that a catastrophe?\n\n1:13:57.460 --> 1:14:00.900\n No, because they don't need two barber shops.\n\n1:14:00.900 --> 1:14:03.060\n Now, if that barber shop started to take advantage\n\n1:14:03.060 --> 1:14:05.380\n of people, started to charge higher price,\n\n1:14:05.380 --> 1:14:07.460\n well, then that's just an opportunity for others\n\n1:14:07.460 --> 1:14:10.020\n to step in and put them in their place.\n\n1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:11.460\n And that's the same thing with power plants.\n\n1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:13.580\n It's the same thing with everything.\n\n1:14:13.580 --> 1:14:17.340\n Ultimately, I think the key thing is this.\n\n1:14:17.340 --> 1:14:20.140\n From the central planning perspective,\n\n1:14:20.140 --> 1:14:22.700\n they'll present you the problem as it is,\n\n1:14:22.700 --> 1:14:24.620\n and they'll tell you, well, this is bad.\n\n1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:28.140\n So the fix, and what we can do is better.\n\n1:14:28.140 --> 1:14:31.900\n So let's stop what's bad and do what is better.\n\n1:14:31.900 --> 1:14:32.740\n Two problems here.\n\n1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:34.960\n Usually, the reason that the thing is bad\n\n1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:37.100\n in the first place is because it is a government monopoly.\n\n1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:39.180\n It's because of government intervention.\n\n1:14:39.180 --> 1:14:41.980\n But the second thing is that this notion\n\n1:14:41.980 --> 1:14:44.180\n that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong\n\n1:14:44.180 --> 1:14:48.700\n and make it better, it ignores the fundamental\n\n1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:51.500\n underlying reality, which is that what you're doing\n\n1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:54.780\n is you're offering only one way for this problem\n\n1:14:54.780 --> 1:14:57.340\n to be solved and making all other solutions\n\n1:14:57.340 --> 1:14:58.340\n practically illegal.\n\n1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.860\n You're taking taxpayer money, you're putting guns\n\n1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:02.940\n to people's heads to take their money,\n\n1:15:02.940 --> 1:15:04.940\n to use it to build, say, this one solution\n\n1:15:04.940 --> 1:15:07.380\n for a power plant, but you're preventing\n\n1:15:07.380 --> 1:15:09.820\n the free market process from providing us\n\n1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:11.300\n with other alternatives.\n\n1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:13.700\n Well, so you phrased it sort of from that perspective,\n\n1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:18.500\n but in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism\n\n1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:22.340\n for the solution that you propose and enforce\n\n1:15:22.340 --> 1:15:25.840\n by, as you're saying, placing a gun to people's head.\n\n1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.140\n You're accountable for that choice,\n\n1:15:29.140 --> 1:15:30.780\n for the quality of that solution,\n\n1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:34.740\n by being voted out if the solution is actually bad.\n\n1:15:34.740 --> 1:15:37.300\n So it's just a different selection mechanism.\n\n1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:41.420\n And I think, I personally believe it is a selection mechanism\n\n1:15:41.420 --> 1:15:43.540\n that has worked in the past.\n\n1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:46.980\n It just often does not work nearly as well\n\n1:15:46.980 --> 1:15:48.660\n as a free market.\n\n1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:52.020\n And the question is, are there domains\n\n1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:54.780\n in which the free market gets itself into trouble?\n\n1:15:54.780 --> 1:15:58.820\n So this theoretical view is that that's the point\n\n1:15:58.820 --> 1:16:01.940\n of a free market, is it doesn't, if there's trouble,\n\n1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:05.780\n that's a signal, and it will respond to that signal,\n\n1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:07.860\n and it will respond appropriately\n\n1:16:07.860 --> 1:16:10.340\n to try to maximize happiness.\n\n1:16:10.340 --> 1:16:12.460\n The question is, is there a local optima\n\n1:16:12.460 --> 1:16:15.620\n that free markets get stuck in and need governments\n\n1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:19.100\n to represent the broader scale of the people\n\n1:16:19.100 --> 1:16:20.500\n to get outside of that?\n\n1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:24.180\n I think the fundamental problem here is the idea\n\n1:16:24.180 --> 1:16:26.100\n that there is a feedback mechanism\n\n1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:28.940\n when there is coercion in one party,\n\n1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:31.780\n when one party can employ coercion and the other one cannot.\n\n1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:34.840\n So in other words, I'm gonna put a gun to your head,\n\n1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:36.900\n I'm gonna take your money, and I'm gonna use it\n\n1:16:36.900 --> 1:16:39.960\n to buy more guns for me to put against your head,\n\n1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:42.980\n but somehow you're gonna put a paper in a box\n\n1:16:42.980 --> 1:16:45.920\n and that's going to deactivate my guns.\n\n1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:48.020\n Well, love requires a push and pull,\n\n1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:50.340\n a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship,\n\n1:16:50.340 --> 1:16:53.660\n I think, a little gun to the head.\n\n1:16:53.660 --> 1:16:55.500\n Good luck to anybody who's gonna be dating you\n\n1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:57.140\n if you think putting a gun to people's head\n\n1:16:57.140 --> 1:16:58.780\n is comparable to a relationship.\n\n1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:04.340\n All jokes, but yes, I mean, the people don't often think\n\n1:17:04.340 --> 1:17:09.340\n of it as government and the military as gun to the head,\n\n1:17:09.340 --> 1:17:11.700\n but that is sort of a libertarian perspective\n\n1:17:11.700 --> 1:17:13.820\n because ultimately when you, you know,\n\n1:17:13.820 --> 1:17:16.660\n turtles all the way down and at the bottom there's guns.\n\n1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:17.500\n Yeah, so.\n\n1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:18.860\n At the bottom if you don't want to pay,\n\n1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:19.740\n if you don't want to, you know,\n\n1:17:19.740 --> 1:17:21.260\n all right, I don't want to be part of your power plant,\n\n1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:23.180\n I want to get my own generator, I don't want to do it,\n\n1:17:23.180 --> 1:17:25.260\n and I don't want to pay for it, I'll go to jail.\n\n1:17:25.260 --> 1:17:26.620\n You can't not pay for it.\n\n1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:28.580\n That's really the asymmetry which the market doesn't have,\n\n1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:31.940\n which is why, in my opinion, it's not as if, you know,\n\n1:17:31.940 --> 1:17:34.220\n I'm being stubborn and stuck on the idea\n\n1:17:34.220 --> 1:17:37.580\n that I want a market and that the government can't work.\n\n1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.620\n It's presented as if, you know, we're choosing\n\n1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:40.940\n between two different machines.\n\n1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:43.940\n You know, should we use an Apple or a PC?\n\n1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:46.740\n And I'm just constantly choosing one of them\n\n1:17:46.740 --> 1:17:48.660\n and saying that the other one can't work.\n\n1:17:48.660 --> 1:17:50.500\n It's not equivalent, it's not two machines.\n\n1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:54.700\n We're comparing between a machine and a gun to the head.\n\n1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:56.020\n And we're comparing between a situation\n\n1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:59.980\n in which anybody anywhere is free to provide the service\n\n1:17:59.980 --> 1:18:02.740\n or the good, and anybody anywhere is free to buy it\n\n1:18:02.740 --> 1:18:05.020\n from them or reject to buy it from them.\n\n1:18:05.020 --> 1:18:08.260\n So anyone can build a power plant, anyone can succeed at it,\n\n1:18:08.260 --> 1:18:10.860\n anybody can fail at it, anybody can build it in a way\n\n1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:14.100\n that I can choose to take part in or not take part in.\n\n1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:15.380\n I can build my own.\n\n1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:18.260\n So we have a situation which 10 million people, let's say,\n\n1:18:18.260 --> 1:18:22.220\n they each can freely choose to provide the good\n\n1:18:22.220 --> 1:18:23.620\n or to buy the good.\n\n1:18:23.620 --> 1:18:28.100\n That cannot be considered an alternative on an equal footing\n\n1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:31.060\n to a situation where one person or one entity\n\n1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:33.740\n gets to decide for everybody and those people\n\n1:18:33.740 --> 1:18:37.260\n decide for everybody and those who disagree go to jail.\n\n1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:41.900\n So the problem is that the alternative to governments\n\n1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:45.820\n is other large successful entities that have humans in them\n\n1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:48.180\n and human nature is such that there's corruption,\n\n1:18:48.180 --> 1:18:50.180\n manipulation and so on.\n\n1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:54.340\n I think free market depends on the honest communication\n\n1:18:57.020 --> 1:18:59.980\n of information as widely as possible\n\n1:18:59.980 --> 1:19:02.620\n so that people can make great rational decisions\n\n1:19:02.620 --> 1:19:06.100\n but sort of my fear is, I'd like to propose\n\n1:19:06.100 --> 1:19:08.060\n is that in general there's manipulation\n\n1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:10.180\n whether it's government, whether it's companies.\n\n1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:13.060\n They're going to try to do propaganda.\n\n1:19:13.060 --> 1:19:16.980\n They're going to try to manipulate you, deceive you,\n\n1:19:16.980 --> 1:19:19.940\n shut down competition by playing games,\n\n1:19:19.940 --> 1:19:21.500\n human games of different kinds\n\n1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:24.380\n and sometimes even meaning well.\n\n1:19:24.380 --> 1:19:26.140\n It's not like everybody thinks they're doing good\n\n1:19:26.140 --> 1:19:27.620\n and they're actually doing evil.\n\n1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:32.620\n So how do we prevent the worst of human nature coming out\n\n1:19:32.820 --> 1:19:35.020\n in a free market as well?\n\n1:19:35.020 --> 1:19:37.540\n By not giving the worst of human nature\n\n1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:40.740\n a monopoly on violence in the institution of government.\n\n1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:42.940\n That little inkling of coercion,\n\n1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:47.100\n that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic\n\n1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:49.940\n like ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.\n\n1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:51.700\n Yes and it ends up just being the place\n\n1:19:51.700 --> 1:19:55.180\n where corporations, individuals, free markets,\n\n1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:57.820\n they can't coerce without the resort to government.\n\n1:19:57.820 --> 1:19:59.460\n So you think about all the examples\n\n1:19:59.460 --> 1:20:02.740\n of corrupt corporations doing bad things.\n\n1:20:02.740 --> 1:20:06.420\n It's always because they have certain privileges\n\n1:20:06.420 --> 1:20:10.060\n from governments because as it exists,\n\n1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:13.060\n Coca Cola, McDonald's, all of these giant corporations,\n\n1:20:13.060 --> 1:20:15.860\n they can't do anything to me without government.\n\n1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:17.140\n They can't take any of my money\n\n1:20:17.140 --> 1:20:19.300\n and they can't force me to buy their stuff\n\n1:20:19.300 --> 1:20:21.460\n and so it doesn't matter to me.\n\n1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:24.020\n So if Coca Cola is corrupted,\n\n1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:25.820\n that's a problem for Coca Cola customers,\n\n1:20:25.820 --> 1:20:27.940\n that's a problem for Coca Cola shareholders,\n\n1:20:27.940 --> 1:20:30.940\n that's a problem for anybody who deals with Coca Cola\n\n1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:32.460\n but as somebody who doesn't drink their stuff\n\n1:20:32.460 --> 1:20:34.380\n and isn't a shareholder,\n\n1:20:34.380 --> 1:20:36.540\n I have absolutely no interest in what happens.\n\n1:20:36.540 --> 1:20:38.980\n They could all go bust tomorrow and I don't care.\n\n1:20:38.980 --> 1:20:43.220\n I don't buy their product and I'm not a shareholder.\n\n1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:46.420\n So in this situation where you choose to voluntarily\n\n1:20:47.340 --> 1:20:50.140\n associate with people and you only give your money\n\n1:20:50.140 --> 1:20:52.460\n to people you want to voluntarily give the money to\n\n1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:54.260\n so you either buy their product\n\n1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:55.900\n or invest in their production,\n\n1:20:55.900 --> 1:20:58.740\n in that situation, the only way that a company\n\n1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:03.100\n can get my money is if they build a product that I value\n\n1:21:03.100 --> 1:21:07.260\n or if they convince me that they are going to use it\n\n1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:10.780\n in a way that's profitable and I may be wrong.\n\n1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:12.700\n I may invest in a company that fails\n\n1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:17.300\n or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent\n\n1:21:17.300 --> 1:21:22.300\n but that's my fault and it's my fault\n\n1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:24.740\n that I gave them my money\n\n1:21:24.740 --> 1:21:26.860\n and then it turned out to be scoundrels\n\n1:21:26.860 --> 1:21:28.980\n but it's a totally different problem\n\n1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:32.260\n when we make it mandatory.\n\n1:21:32.260 --> 1:21:36.100\n It's violence, it's a crime to put a gun to my head\n\n1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:38.540\n and force me to subsidize companies\n\n1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:41.300\n and force me to come at certain conclusions.\n\n1:21:41.300 --> 1:21:43.180\n Do you find an interesting distinction,\n\n1:21:43.180 --> 1:21:46.740\n Mr. Michael Malice, between anarchism and libertarianism?\n\n1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:49.800\n So this particular use of violence,\n\n1:21:50.900 --> 1:21:53.680\n this last resort, this policing force\n\n1:21:53.680 --> 1:21:56.220\n that libertarianism is okay with\n\n1:21:56.220 --> 1:21:58.740\n and anarchism is not okay with.\n\n1:21:58.740 --> 1:22:02.500\n So basically nation states that keep you safe\n\n1:22:02.500 --> 1:22:05.320\n from the worst of war.\n\n1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:06.540\n Yeah, I think to be more accurate,\n\n1:22:06.540 --> 1:22:09.020\n the distinction between anarchism and minarchism,\n\n1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:11.660\n I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term\n\n1:22:11.660 --> 1:22:13.300\n that can encompass both.\n\n1:22:13.300 --> 1:22:14.420\n Means a lot of things, okay.\n\n1:22:14.420 --> 1:22:15.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:19.880\n On the Karl Marx to Michael Malice spectrum,\n\n1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:20.720\n where do you?\n\n1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:22.140\n No, no, I'm full anarchist.\n\n1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:22.980\n You're a full anarchist.\n\n1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:23.800\n Yeah, full anarchist.\n\n1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:26.320\n I mean, I don't find any justification\n\n1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:31.320\n for the use of force and I think recently perhaps,\n\n1:22:31.460 --> 1:22:33.780\n maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting senile,\n\n1:22:33.780 --> 1:22:36.060\n maybe I'm getting wise, who knows?\n\n1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:39.660\n But I'm beginning to become more sympathetic to monarchy.\n\n1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:43.180\n So I'm an anarchist, monarchy.\n\n1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:44.440\n Which, what is that?\n\n1:22:44.440 --> 1:22:46.020\n Kings, royal. Oh, monarchy.\n\n1:22:46.020 --> 1:22:46.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.020\n And I think.\n\n1:22:49.020 --> 1:22:51.860\n Wait, are you joking or not?\n\n1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:53.140\n No, I'm not joking.\n\n1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:58.140\n And I think, I mean, I think morally and intellectually,\n\n1:22:58.420 --> 1:23:02.380\n I'm an anarchist, but the reality is we find ourselves\n\n1:23:02.380 --> 1:23:05.560\n in a world in which a lot of people are not.\n\n1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:09.380\n And the question is, what is the thing\n\n1:23:09.380 --> 1:23:12.760\n that is going to provide you with more freedom?\n\n1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:16.740\n And I think, I'm recently coming around to the idea\n\n1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.420\n that monarchy might be the best way\n\n1:23:19.420 --> 1:23:22.080\n to provide people with the largest amount of freedom\n\n1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:25.960\n because to have a free society, you need a majority,\n\n1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:28.060\n perhaps, or a plurality of people\n\n1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:31.880\n to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas,\n\n1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.100\n to have a low time preference,\n\n1:23:33.100 --> 1:23:35.720\n to have a preference for the future.\n\n1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:37.480\n So you need a majority of the population\n\n1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:41.300\n to not decide to go and do something insane\n\n1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:44.400\n in order to continue to have a free society.\n\n1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:48.580\n You know, when a respiratory illness comes along,\n\n1:23:48.580 --> 1:23:51.140\n unfortunately, you know, the last couple of years\n\n1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:53.620\n showed that we, the vast majority of people\n\n1:23:53.620 --> 1:23:57.340\n are gonna freak out and lose their mind\n\n1:23:57.340 --> 1:24:00.500\n and support whatever their stupid TV tells them to support.\n\n1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:03.580\n And, you know, there's always a current thing\n\n1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.840\n and the media is always telling you\n\n1:24:05.840 --> 1:24:08.320\n that we need this current thing as an excuse\n\n1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:10.260\n for more and more government power\n\n1:24:10.260 --> 1:24:11.660\n and more and more government coercion.\n\n1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:13.100\n What's the role of kings and queens\n\n1:24:13.100 --> 1:24:15.980\n in that case of a monarchy?\n\n1:24:15.980 --> 1:24:17.700\n What's the role of a leader?\n\n1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:20.840\n I think there might be a case that,\n\n1:24:21.700 --> 1:24:24.340\n so as I was saying, you need a majority of the population\n\n1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:28.300\n to get together and decide, nope, whatever is the case,\n\n1:24:28.300 --> 1:24:30.500\n you know, the answer is voluntary.\n\n1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:34.100\n No matter how bad the disease is,\n\n1:24:34.100 --> 1:24:36.320\n it doesn't justify forcing people to stay home.\n\n1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:37.520\n You wanna stay home, stay home.\n\n1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:39.640\n You wanna wear a mask, take a vaccine,\n\n1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:42.460\n do whatever you want, but you can't force others to do that.\n\n1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:43.940\n So you need a majority of the people\n\n1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:46.420\n to strongly believe in this principle\n\n1:24:46.420 --> 1:24:50.380\n in order to get it in a democracy.\n\n1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:52.480\n Whereas in a monarchy,\n\n1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:54.460\n maybe you just need the king to get it.\n\n1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:57.400\n And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it\n\n1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:00.000\n is that kings have a low time preference\n\n1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:03.540\n where they think about things for many generations.\n\n1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:05.420\n Whereas in a democratic system,\n\n1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:08.220\n your president is likely only going to be there\n\n1:25:08.220 --> 1:25:10.620\n for four years or eight years or 10 years\n\n1:25:10.620 --> 1:25:12.620\n or five years or whatever it is.\n\n1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:14.540\n So the only way that, you know,\n\n1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:15.900\n all humans are self interested.\n\n1:25:15.900 --> 1:25:17.940\n So the only way that your president in a democracy\n\n1:25:17.940 --> 1:25:20.980\n can provide for themselves is to maximize\n\n1:25:20.980 --> 1:25:23.300\n the amount of exploitation that they can do\n\n1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:26.380\n of the population during their brief stint.\n\n1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:28.660\n And then when he's out, you get a new one,\n\n1:25:28.660 --> 1:25:30.540\n and then that one wants to start all over again.\n\n1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:33.060\n So every four years, you get a new robber.\n\n1:25:33.060 --> 1:25:37.260\n With monarchy, you sign up for a multi generation\n\n1:25:37.260 --> 1:25:41.380\n subscription to the same family.\n\n1:25:41.380 --> 1:25:44.140\n And when they have the security of knowing that,\n\n1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:47.940\n you know, his great grandson is going to be\n\n1:25:47.940 --> 1:25:50.860\n taking money from your great grandson,\n\n1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:54.340\n suddenly his interest in yours align\n\n1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:56.420\n because they both want your great grandson\n\n1:25:56.420 --> 1:25:58.500\n to be prosperous and have enough money\n\n1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:00.260\n for his great grandson to take.\n\n1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:02.320\n It's a monarchy with a tiny government.\n\n1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.320\n So anything required to really provide for a free market.\n\n1:26:08.980 --> 1:26:11.020\n So for maximizing individual freedom\n\n1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:12.460\n and the freedom of the economy.\n\n1:26:12.460 --> 1:26:15.460\n Yeah, and if I were a king, which is highly unlikely\n\n1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:17.060\n to ever happen, but I think, you know,\n\n1:26:17.060 --> 1:26:20.140\n if you look historically, the dynasties\n\n1:26:20.140 --> 1:26:23.180\n that have succeeded at lasting for a long time,\n\n1:26:23.180 --> 1:26:24.940\n the key thing that they managed to do\n\n1:26:24.940 --> 1:26:26.900\n is to basically be libertarian.\n\n1:26:26.900 --> 1:26:29.780\n The key to being a good king is to just leave people alone.\n\n1:26:29.780 --> 1:26:31.180\n Let them do whatever they want.\n\n1:26:31.180 --> 1:26:34.260\n Don't rob them too much or rob them as little as possible,\n\n1:26:34.260 --> 1:26:36.140\n or maybe even don't rob them.\n\n1:26:36.140 --> 1:26:40.580\n And, you know, as a king, use your power only\n\n1:26:40.580 --> 1:26:43.220\n to punish people who aggress against others.\n\n1:26:43.220 --> 1:26:44.900\n Don't use your power to enrich yourself\n\n1:26:44.900 --> 1:26:46.340\n and enrich your friends.\n\n1:26:46.340 --> 1:26:49.760\n And that's really, like, if you look at smart kings,\n\n1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:50.600\n this is what they do.\n\n1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:51.740\n This is what they teach their children.\n\n1:26:51.740 --> 1:26:54.180\n And the cycle of kingdoms is that, you know,\n\n1:26:54.180 --> 1:26:56.020\n the first king understands this,\n\n1:26:56.020 --> 1:26:59.780\n builds the empire and the first couple of generations,\n\n1:26:59.780 --> 1:27:04.700\n they get this and the society is free, the economy is free.\n\n1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:09.100\n And because of that, you know, there's peace and prosperity,\n\n1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:12.500\n but then over time, the next generation of kids\n\n1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:14.780\n become a lot more high time preference.\n\n1:27:14.780 --> 1:27:17.300\n They haven't worked hard.\n\n1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:20.020\n They don't understand the meaning of hard work.\n\n1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:23.780\n So they become more likely to engage\n\n1:27:23.780 --> 1:27:24.940\n in destructive behavior.\n\n1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:29.940\n So raise taxes, pass laws that require people to do things,\n\n1:27:31.180 --> 1:27:33.860\n even when they're not hurting anybody.\n\n1:27:33.860 --> 1:27:36.900\n And that ends up basically eventually destroying the kingdom.\n\n1:27:37.940 --> 1:27:40.300\n Of course, power corrupts.\n\n1:27:40.300 --> 1:27:42.780\n So you have to kind of create human institutions\n\n1:27:42.780 --> 1:27:45.940\n that prevent you as a king or any kind of leader\n\n1:27:45.940 --> 1:27:50.940\n from expand, so going back on the original promises\n\n1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:54.620\n and the purposes of your position.\n\n1:27:54.620 --> 1:27:58.020\n And then distracting, using tools of technology\n\n1:27:58.020 --> 1:28:00.060\n and communication to distract the populace\n\n1:28:00.060 --> 1:28:01.300\n while you expand the power.\n\n1:28:01.300 --> 1:28:02.140\n Exactly.\n\n1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:05.780\n All right, you wrote the fiat standard.\n\n1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:08.580\n I think we danced around it quite a bit,\n\n1:28:08.580 --> 1:28:10.180\n but I don't know if we actually defined it.\n\n1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:11.860\n So what is fiat money?\n\n1:28:11.860 --> 1:28:14.700\n What is the history of how it came to be?\n\n1:28:14.700 --> 1:28:16.140\n The fascinating history of the birth\n\n1:28:16.140 --> 1:28:18.460\n of the fiat monetary system is something\n\n1:28:18.460 --> 1:28:21.740\n that really only got uncovered in 2017.\n\n1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:25.100\n This is extremely, extremely interesting.\n\n1:28:25.100 --> 1:28:29.700\n In 1914, Britain joined World War I.\n\n1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:31.740\n And if you remember your history books,\n\n1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:35.380\n it's famous that this was called August Bank Holiday.\n\n1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:36.820\n It was just going to be a few weeks\n\n1:28:36.820 --> 1:28:38.340\n where the British troops were gonna go\n\n1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:41.780\n and kick European ass and come back triumphant.\n\n1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:44.100\n And most European countries believed that.\n\n1:28:44.100 --> 1:28:46.420\n But then the war kept on dragging on.\n\n1:28:46.420 --> 1:28:48.380\n And of course, to finance the war,\n\n1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:49.980\n the government, this is what they used to do\n\n1:28:49.980 --> 1:28:50.820\n under the gold standard,\n\n1:28:50.820 --> 1:28:53.020\n governments would issue bonds.\n\n1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:55.660\n So you'd issue the bonds, people would buy the bonds,\n\n1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:57.980\n the money would be used to finance the military,\n\n1:28:57.980 --> 1:29:00.740\n and then the government would pay off the bond\n\n1:29:00.740 --> 1:29:03.060\n over the next five or 10 or 20 years.\n\n1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:06.260\n So for World War I, the British government,\n\n1:29:06.260 --> 1:29:10.220\n the British treasury issued bonds for financing the war.\n\n1:29:10.220 --> 1:29:13.460\n And this only came to light in 2017.\n\n1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:15.860\n Only a third of the bonds were actually subscribed.\n\n1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:17.260\n So people, British people,\n\n1:29:17.260 --> 1:29:19.180\n and this is perhaps the greatest thing\n\n1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:20.340\n that they've ever done,\n\n1:29:20.340 --> 1:29:22.220\n they decided fighting a war in Europe\n\n1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:25.300\n is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.\n\n1:29:25.300 --> 1:29:26.140\n It's a stupid thing.\n\n1:29:26.140 --> 1:29:27.300\n Why should I go and fight?\n\n1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:30.180\n Because the Austrians and the Germans and the Serbians\n\n1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:34.220\n are at each other's throats.\n\n1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:36.180\n I'd rather invest in something else.\n\n1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:38.940\n So they only bought a third of the bond issue.\n\n1:29:38.940 --> 1:29:42.140\n And then the astonishing thing that happened,\n\n1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:44.180\n which really set the tone for the next century\n\n1:29:44.180 --> 1:29:49.140\n of war, murder, Keynesianism, and theft and inflation,\n\n1:29:49.140 --> 1:29:52.740\n was that the Bank of England went and got\n\n1:29:52.740 --> 1:29:56.700\n two of the high ranking officials in the Bank of England\n\n1:29:56.700 --> 1:29:59.460\n to buy the other remaining outstanding two thirds\n\n1:29:59.460 --> 1:30:01.580\n of the bonds under their own name\n\n1:30:01.580 --> 1:30:03.220\n with a line of credit from the Bank of England.\n\n1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:04.740\n So it wasn't their own money.\n\n1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:06.700\n But they took money essentially from the Bank of England,\n\n1:30:06.700 --> 1:30:10.420\n bought two thirds of the bonds that financed the war.\n\n1:30:10.420 --> 1:30:12.700\n And that was how England was able\n\n1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:14.900\n to keep going into the war.\n\n1:30:14.900 --> 1:30:17.140\n So that's essentially what they did\n\n1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:20.180\n is what we today know as quantitative easing.\n\n1:30:20.180 --> 1:30:23.740\n Back then, they just got, they printed money\n\n1:30:23.740 --> 1:30:26.220\n from the Bank of England, or credit, printed credit,\n\n1:30:26.220 --> 1:30:29.020\n gave it to those two employees.\n\n1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:30.020\n They bought the bonds.\n\n1:30:30.020 --> 1:30:32.420\n The government could fight the war.\n\n1:30:32.420 --> 1:30:34.540\n Sounds like it's a nice idea.\n\n1:30:34.540 --> 1:30:38.180\n And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself,\n\n1:30:38.180 --> 1:30:42.100\n he himself said this was, he wrote a letter\n\n1:30:42.100 --> 1:30:44.020\n to the Bank of England that was uncovered recently.\n\n1:30:44.020 --> 1:30:45.900\n And he said, I congratulate you\n\n1:30:45.900 --> 1:30:48.020\n on this masterly manipulation.\n\n1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:49.420\n I quote it in the book.\n\n1:30:49.420 --> 1:30:51.700\n Masterly manipulation is what he called it.\n\n1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:54.740\n That they basically managed to buy the bonds\n\n1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:56.420\n using the money of the government.\n\n1:30:56.420 --> 1:31:00.020\n And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works\n\n1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:01.620\n because he never could ask the question of,\n\n1:31:01.620 --> 1:31:02.780\n okay, and then what?\n\n1:31:02.780 --> 1:31:04.380\n All right, so we just printed money\n\n1:31:04.380 --> 1:31:07.340\n to buy two thirds of these government bonds.\n\n1:31:07.340 --> 1:31:09.060\n What's gonna happen next?\n\n1:31:09.060 --> 1:31:10.420\n What could go wrong?\n\n1:31:10.420 --> 1:31:12.860\n Not a question Keynesians ask themselves\n\n1:31:12.860 --> 1:31:16.740\n because their jobs depend on not thinking\n\n1:31:16.740 --> 1:31:18.300\n about what's going to go wrong.\n\n1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:20.660\n So a quick question about war.\n\n1:31:20.660 --> 1:31:23.660\n And as somebody who's been nonstop reading\n\n1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:26.700\n and thinking about the wars of the 20th century\n\n1:31:26.700 --> 1:31:31.660\n and thinking that most of those wars\n\n1:31:31.660 --> 1:31:34.500\n were unjust, unethical, and destructive,\n\n1:31:37.060 --> 1:31:40.180\n how else do you find, how would you finance a war?\n\n1:31:40.180 --> 1:31:41.020\n So.\n\n1:31:41.020 --> 1:31:41.940\n Ideally you don't.\n\n1:31:41.940 --> 1:31:43.060\n No, but I mean, of course there are,\n\n1:31:43.060 --> 1:31:45.140\n sometimes you wanna fight for self defense.\n\n1:31:45.140 --> 1:31:48.540\n Yeah, you finance it, taxation, or bonds.\n\n1:31:48.540 --> 1:31:51.140\n See, the people really need to want a war\n\n1:31:51.140 --> 1:31:54.020\n not just with their voices, their thoughts,\n\n1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:56.740\n their tweets, or their actual financial investment.\n\n1:31:56.740 --> 1:31:59.260\n Put up the bullets and the cost of the bullets\n\n1:31:59.260 --> 1:32:00.420\n and the bodies.\n\n1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:03.660\n So their life and their financial well being.\n\n1:32:05.500 --> 1:32:07.420\n That's how it was under the gold standard mostly\n\n1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:09.220\n because under the gold standard,\n\n1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:10.660\n the government couldn't print gold.\n\n1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:12.780\n And so they had a budget and they had a certain amount\n\n1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:15.020\n of gold and that wasn't just, you know,\n\n1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:16.740\n that they couldn't infinitely increase it.\n\n1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:20.180\n So they couldn't tax their population at will.\n\n1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.860\n And it's very difficult to take money from people.\n\n1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:25.620\n You know, you go knock on doors and search everybody's home,\n\n1:32:25.620 --> 1:32:27.260\n see where they're hiding their gold.\n\n1:32:27.260 --> 1:32:28.620\n It's very complicated.\n\n1:32:28.620 --> 1:32:30.220\n On the other hand, when you gave them paper money,\n\n1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:33.220\n which is what the case was in 1914,\n\n1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:36.220\n you could take their wealth just by printing the money.\n\n1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:38.780\n And that's what changed everything when it comes to war.\n\n1:32:38.780 --> 1:32:41.980\n That's why the 20th century was the century of total war.\n\n1:32:41.980 --> 1:32:43.220\n Because under the gold standard,\n\n1:32:43.220 --> 1:32:46.420\n governments fought until they ran out of their own gold.\n\n1:32:46.420 --> 1:32:48.700\n Under the fiat standard, with paper money,\n\n1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:50.900\n with credit money, governments fought\n\n1:32:50.900 --> 1:32:53.480\n until they ran out of liquid wealth\n\n1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:55.840\n in the hands of all of their citizens.\n\n1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:00.840\n So let's find flaws in this thinking if there's any.\n\n1:33:01.460 --> 1:33:06.460\n Okay, there's a lot of pacifist type of thinking\n\n1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:10.020\n in World War II as Hitler was expanding and expanding.\n\n1:33:10.020 --> 1:33:14.660\n Hitler framed himself as a victim of the past, of history.\n\n1:33:14.660 --> 1:33:16.940\n He never attacked anybody.\n\n1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:18.940\n Everyone's always threatening to attack him.\n\n1:33:18.940 --> 1:33:20.140\n That's kind of the narrative.\n\n1:33:20.140 --> 1:33:21.580\n And he keeps expanding.\n\n1:33:21.580 --> 1:33:23.660\n He keeps sweet talking with his charisma,\n\n1:33:23.660 --> 1:33:25.940\n all the countries around him,\n\n1:33:25.940 --> 1:33:28.820\n into sort of embracing pacifism.\n\n1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.820\n Stay out of the war until the war is on your doorstep.\n\n1:33:31.820 --> 1:33:36.820\n So France, just very suboptimal military strategy\n\n1:33:37.380 --> 1:33:39.940\n from the perspective of many European nations\n\n1:33:39.940 --> 1:33:41.860\n in response to Hitler.\n\n1:33:41.860 --> 1:33:45.620\n They were basically hoodwinked by his words.\n\n1:33:45.620 --> 1:33:50.620\n So then there's Churchill, Winston Churchill,\n\n1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:55.300\n who stepped up and says, perhaps irrationally,\n\n1:33:55.300 --> 1:33:57.860\n from some kind of economics perspective,\n\n1:33:57.860 --> 1:33:59.900\n saying we're not going to back down.\n\n1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:01.580\n We're going to fight Germany.\n\n1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:05.220\n And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons\n\n1:34:05.220 --> 1:34:09.140\n that Hitler failed in his expansion.\n\n1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:13.580\n That decision to fight back,\n\n1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:18.780\n how, what's the right way to do that?\n\n1:34:18.780 --> 1:34:20.400\n If you're Winston Churchill,\n\n1:34:21.260 --> 1:34:23.320\n what's the right way to do that?\n\n1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:28.320\n If you're, to fight back evil when violence is required.\n\n1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:30.440\n Evil when violence is required.\n\n1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:35.440\n Now, you could argue that no war is just,\n\n1:34:35.440 --> 1:34:38.840\n but there is such a thing as a just war index.\n\n1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:41.920\n And a lot of people argue if there is a just war\n\n1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:44.880\n in the 20th century, it's World War II.\n\n1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:49.800\n So how would you fund, if you were Britain, the war?\n\n1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:52.200\n Would you require Winston Churchill\n\n1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:54.800\n to convince the populace?\n\n1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:57.480\n Don't fight until they're fully convinced\n\n1:34:57.480 --> 1:34:59.120\n that this is the right thing to do.\n\n1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:01.240\n You can't just make a decision for them.\n\n1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:02.960\n You have to convince them fully\n\n1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.400\n so that they give their life\n\n1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:07.760\n and they give their money to support the war.\n\n1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:08.720\n Is that the right way to do it?\n\n1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:09.560\n I think so.\n\n1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:13.280\n And I think when you have a true threat\n\n1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:14.760\n and a true evil and a true force\n\n1:35:14.760 --> 1:35:18.300\n that people really do think is genuine,\n\n1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:19.360\n you don't need to convince them.\n\n1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:22.760\n I mean, when it's real, people will want to fight\n\n1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:24.440\n and people will want to pay to fight.\n\n1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:28.880\n And I mean, I think, though, on this particular example,\n\n1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.680\n I think the best way to fight Hitler\n\n1:35:30.680 --> 1:35:33.400\n is to have not fought World War I\n\n1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:36.080\n and not take out the Kaiser of Germany.\n\n1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:40.120\n If Britain and the US had not gotten involved\n\n1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:44.560\n in World War I, which really is the senseless war\n\n1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:46.600\n about nothing, what was in it?\n\n1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.600\n And what was the goal from anybody fighting that war?\n\n1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:52.360\n If you look at it, after World War I,\n\n1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:54.800\n there were very minor adjustments\n\n1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:57.640\n in the borders of the countries that were participating.\n\n1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:00.840\n So Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land,\n\n1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:04.320\n but really it wasn't all that massive.\n\n1:36:04.320 --> 1:36:09.320\n And it wasn't like Britain wanted to take over Germany\n\n1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.040\n and move their people into Germany and kick the Germans out.\n\n1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:17.040\n So there was no real value from that war.\n\n1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:18.100\n And that's why the British people\n\n1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:19.960\n didn't want to take part in it.\n\n1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:22.760\n And that's why if they hadn't done\n\n1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:25.560\n this enormously criminal manipulation\n\n1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:28.520\n of printing money to buy the bonds,\n\n1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:30.720\n Britain wouldn't have gotten into the war.\n\n1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.520\n Germany would still be a kingdom and Hitler wouldn't rise.\n\n1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:37.240\n And yeah, there'd be small changes\n\n1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.440\n in the borders of various European countries.\n\n1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:44.800\n I struggled to see how it could have been worse.\n\n1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:47.900\n I mean, I struggled to see who benefited\n\n1:36:47.900 --> 1:36:50.800\n from four years of carnage in Europe.\n\n1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:53.620\n And then this came at the height of civilization.\n\n1:36:53.620 --> 1:36:55.640\n Before that, the people of Europe\n\n1:36:55.640 --> 1:37:00.160\n had the golden era under the gold standard.\n\n1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:02.000\n They were trading with one another, they traveled\n\n1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.400\n and technology was advancing.\n\n1:37:04.400 --> 1:37:08.760\n And they did not expect this war to last this long.\n\n1:37:08.760 --> 1:37:11.360\n And my favorite story from World War I\n\n1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:14.840\n is the Christmas truce football game,\n\n1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:16.480\n which I mentioned in my book.\n\n1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:19.640\n British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict,\n\n1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:20.760\n they stopped on Christmas day\n\n1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:23.120\n and they played a football game against each other.\n\n1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:25.100\n I mean, this is not a real war,\n\n1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:27.680\n where it's a war for survival.\n\n1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:30.340\n Britain didn't want to end Germany.\n\n1:37:30.340 --> 1:37:31.840\n Germany didn't want to end Britain.\n\n1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:35.920\n It was just kings who were emboldened\n\n1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:38.440\n by the fact that they had a printing press\n\n1:37:38.440 --> 1:37:40.240\n playing with the lives of the people.\n\n1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:44.640\n Take that away, take away the printing press,\n\n1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:46.360\n take away their ability to print money.\n\n1:37:46.360 --> 1:37:49.480\n I think we'd have had a much, much, much better\n\n1:37:49.480 --> 1:37:50.960\n 20th century.\n\n1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.520\n Yeah, the counterfactual history.\n\n1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:54.080\n Neil Ferguson is a historian\n\n1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:56.060\n who gets in quite a bit of trouble.\n\n1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.220\n Basically, well, he's a Brit,\n\n1:38:00.220 --> 1:38:03.440\n suggesting that if Britain stayed out of World War I,\n\n1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:05.980\n there would be no Hitler, there would be no World War II.\n\n1:38:05.980 --> 1:38:07.540\n Yep, I agree entirely.\n\n1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.620\n But fiat money.\n\n1:38:10.620 --> 1:38:12.280\n Yeah, so how fiat money was born.\n\n1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:13.560\n Yeah, let's get back to that.\n\n1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:16.160\n So they financed the war with that money.\n\n1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:17.960\n So what could go wrong?\n\n1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:19.220\n That's where we left off.\n\n1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:21.240\n Well, what could go wrong when you've just printed\n\n1:38:21.240 --> 1:38:26.240\n an enormous amount of credit and used it to buy bonds?\n\n1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:28.560\n What goes wrong is that the value of the currency\n\n1:38:28.560 --> 1:38:29.600\n is going to go down.\n\n1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.880\n Or in other words, prices of things are gonna go up.\n\n1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:35.240\n So during the war, prices keep going up.\n\n1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:38.040\n And this is, of course,\n\n1:38:38.040 --> 1:38:39.240\n this is gonna sound very familiar\n\n1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:41.560\n to victims of the 20th century.\n\n1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.400\n A government tells you it's because of the war,\n\n1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:45.240\n it's not our fault, it's because of the Germans,\n\n1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:47.120\n it's because of the foreigners, it's because of Putin,\n\n1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:49.120\n it's because of this, it's because of that.\n\n1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:50.280\n This has always been the case.\n\n1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:55.080\n There's always, war is a very good cover for inflation,\n\n1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:57.880\n which is caused by monetary phenomena.\n\n1:38:57.880 --> 1:38:59.720\n So then the war ends.\n\n1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:02.640\n And inflation, prices have more than doubled\n\n1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:04.760\n over the past four years,\n\n1:39:04.760 --> 1:39:07.640\n over the four years of World War I,\n\n1:39:07.640 --> 1:39:09.420\n prices have more than doubled.\n\n1:39:09.420 --> 1:39:12.800\n And then the British economy is in bad trouble,\n\n1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.360\n obviously, lost a lot of the labor force for four years\n\n1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.280\n that was out there fighting.\n\n1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:23.200\n Now those workers come back, you've got prices are up.\n\n1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:25.960\n And so people are demanding\n\n1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:27.280\n that the government control prices\n\n1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:29.440\n and the government is trying to fix the problem\n\n1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:31.000\n of inflation by doing price controls,\n\n1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:32.840\n which is what they always do,\n\n1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:36.040\n which is catastrophic because it makes things worse.\n\n1:39:36.040 --> 1:39:38.560\n When you implement price controls,\n\n1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:40.840\n you are, when you make, you say, all right,\n\n1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:45.400\n well, bread can't be sold for more than X price.\n\n1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:48.200\n Well, that's just preventing bread producers\n\n1:39:48.200 --> 1:39:49.920\n from producing a lot of bread.\n\n1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.560\n And that's just making the problem worse.\n\n1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:55.160\n If you let the price rise, the extra price,\n\n1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:56.840\n first of all, it makes people economize,\n\n1:39:56.840 --> 1:39:58.760\n so people will only buy what they need.\n\n1:39:58.760 --> 1:40:00.800\n And it provides the money for the bread producers\n\n1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:03.240\n to acquire the capital and the resources\n\n1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:04.840\n they need to produce more bread,\n\n1:40:04.840 --> 1:40:06.480\n which then brings the price of bread down.\n\n1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:08.520\n But price controls destroy that.\n\n1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:10.640\n Then they also implement wage controls.\n\n1:40:10.640 --> 1:40:15.160\n So you wanna also make sure that people have high wages.\n\n1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:17.080\n So you raise people's wages artificially,\n\n1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:18.600\n you lower prices artificially,\n\n1:40:18.600 --> 1:40:21.240\n and you cause an economic problem.\n\n1:40:21.240 --> 1:40:24.960\n And this is basically, I use this historical example\n\n1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:26.680\n because it's the birth of fiat,\n\n1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:28.560\n because the Bank of England was the most important\n\n1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:30.720\n monetary system in the world at that time.\n\n1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:33.560\n And because it's the prototype\n\n1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.120\n that basically the entire planet copied\n\n1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:36.200\n over the last 100 years.\n\n1:40:36.200 --> 1:40:38.120\n We've had this same thing happen.\n\n1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:40.280\n The government prints money because of a stupid reason,\n\n1:40:40.280 --> 1:40:42.240\n because somebody in power decided\n\n1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.800\n this was worth destroying everybody's livelihood\n\n1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:46.160\n and savings for.\n\n1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:47.600\n And then the consequences come in\n\n1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:49.800\n and then they start covering up with price controls,\n\n1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:52.760\n wage controls, and then that makes things worse.\n\n1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:57.480\n And then they, and of course, throughout all of that,\n\n1:40:57.480 --> 1:40:58.840\n they're promising that we're going to go,\n\n1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.240\n oh, and also the other thing that they did,\n\n1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:03.080\n which I mentioned in the chapter is,\n\n1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:05.320\n they stopped people from using physical gold\n\n1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.480\n and they confiscated the, well, they didn't confiscate it,\n\n1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:10.040\n but they took the physical gold and they gave people paper.\n\n1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:12.240\n So I call it the fiat white paper.\n\n1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:14.960\n You know, in Bitcoin, we have the white paper.\n\n1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:17.360\n The fiat white paper was that the Bank of England\n\n1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:20.040\n announced to all of its banks and post offices.\n\n1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:23.200\n And from now on, you should not make payment in gold\n\n1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:24.920\n and you should take payment in gold\n\n1:41:24.920 --> 1:41:26.320\n and you should encourage all your customers\n\n1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:28.640\n to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead.\n\n1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:30.040\n Is there an actual document?\n\n1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:30.880\n Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:31.720\n Nice.\n\n1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:33.400\n Yeah, it was, this is all new stuff.\n\n1:41:33.400 --> 1:41:35.360\n Obviously, nobody really likes to talk about this stuff\n\n1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:36.880\n because, you know, they're fiat economists,\n\n1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:41.160\n so they don't wanna talk about the original sin, but.\n\n1:41:41.160 --> 1:41:42.880\n Well, you should like republish it\n\n1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:45.160\n as the fiat white paper or something like that.\n\n1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:49.680\n There's a fascinating book by a guy called John Osborne.\n\n1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:53.120\n So in the 1920s, I think his name was Montagu.\n\n1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:54.800\n He was the chief of the Bank of England.\n\n1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:58.600\n He commissioned one of his secretaries, John Osborne,\n\n1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:02.520\n to study what the bank did during World War I.\n\n1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:05.200\n And it was a study that was kept under wraps,\n\n1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:07.720\n a confidential, in the Bank of England,\n\n1:42:07.720 --> 1:42:12.160\n only released in 2017, almost a century later.\n\n1:42:12.160 --> 1:42:13.000\n And.\n\n1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.800\n What was special about 2017, by the way, it's a year.\n\n1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:17.920\n It's just it was a year in which\n\n1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:19.840\n some of this information was released.\n\n1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:22.320\n Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements\n\n1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:24.400\n of the Bank of England and found this and published it\n\n1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:26.160\n and now you can download it as a PDF\n\n1:42:26.160 --> 1:42:28.680\n and find all of the amazing details.\n\n1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:31.480\n So they confiscated the gold\n\n1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:32.960\n and they forced people to use the paper\n\n1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:34.560\n and they promised people that as soon as the war\n\n1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:36.360\n was gonna be over, this is temporary,\n\n1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.240\n we're gonna be back to using gold.\n\n1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:42.000\n And of course, you know, if you told people in Britain,\n\n1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:43.920\n this is the real scam about fiat.\n\n1:42:43.920 --> 1:42:47.040\n If you told people in Britain in 1914,\n\n1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:49.040\n hey, we're gonna go off the gold standard\n\n1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:50.320\n because it's better.\n\n1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:53.360\n I mean, there might've been lynchings\n\n1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:56.720\n of government officials because the British pound\n\n1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:00.560\n at that point, it had been the global currency\n\n1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:01.600\n of the whole world.\n\n1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:04.800\n And the fact that they'd managed,\n\n1:43:04.800 --> 1:43:07.120\n the Bank of England had kept the British pound\n\n1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:09.920\n at a fixed rate next to gold for,\n\n1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:12.120\n since Newton, you know, the exchange rate,\n\n1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:14.560\n the value of the British pound was set\n\n1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:16.440\n by Isaac Newton himself.\n\n1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:18.600\n He was the warden of the mint\n\n1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:22.160\n and he made the pound a specific amount of gold.\n\n1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:24.760\n And since then, up until World War I,\n\n1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:28.600\n it was 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold.\n\n1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:31.480\n I think I might be wrong, but I have it in the book.\n\n1:43:31.480 --> 1:43:32.760\n So he'd set that price.\n\n1:43:32.760 --> 1:43:34.240\n And it was a matter of national pride\n\n1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:35.960\n for people in England, you know.\n\n1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:37.600\n The sterling is as good as gold\n\n1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:40.360\n because for two centuries it has been stuck to gold.\n\n1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:42.440\n There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars,\n\n1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:45.240\n but for two centuries, mostly it was stuck to that.\n\n1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:49.200\n And so they went off that and then they couldn't go back\n\n1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:50.320\n because if they wanted to go back,\n\n1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:51.320\n they didn't have enough gold.\n\n1:43:51.320 --> 1:43:54.720\n They shipped their gold to the US to finance the war.\n\n1:43:54.720 --> 1:43:56.840\n And they had printed a whole bunch of money\n\n1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:58.080\n that was out there.\n\n1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:01.280\n So this begins the problem for England.\n\n1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:03.120\n And that begins the end of England\n\n1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:05.120\n as the world's superpower.\n\n1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:06.560\n And the way they tried to fight that\n\n1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.560\n was to get more and more countries around the world\n\n1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:10.640\n to establish central banks and have,\n\n1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:12.200\n and hold British pounds.\n\n1:44:12.200 --> 1:44:15.640\n So they'd hold, you know, basically dumping their bags\n\n1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:17.840\n like just any other shit coin.\n\n1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:20.040\n You just, if you get people to buy your shit coin,\n\n1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:21.840\n you know, that raises the value of your shit coin.\n\n1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:22.680\n So.\n\n1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:23.920\n Can you define shit coin?\n\n1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:27.000\n Shit coin is, in my definition of a shit coin\n\n1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:28.720\n is that it's any form of money\n\n1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.360\n where somebody can produce it.\n\n1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:32.360\n So soft money.\n\n1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:35.080\n Not necessarily, I guess.\n\n1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:38.160\n I think the difference, so there's easy money,\n\n1:44:38.160 --> 1:44:42.120\n but the shit coin is something that someone can produce\n\n1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:45.200\n at a rate that is, at a cost that is different\n\n1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:46.520\n from the market cost.\n\n1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:49.520\n So gold, nobody can make gold except if they dig for it.\n\n1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:52.520\n And the cost of mining gold is generally in the range\n\n1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:53.640\n of the price of gold.\n\n1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:56.400\n Seems true for Bitcoin.\n\n1:44:56.400 --> 1:44:57.800\n So gold is not a shit coin.\n\n1:44:57.800 --> 1:44:59.360\n Gold is not a shit coin.\n\n1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:00.640\n The copper is.\n\n1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:03.000\n Copper, I'm not so sure.\n\n1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.320\n I wouldn't call copper a shit coin\n\n1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:05.800\n as much as it is easy money.\n\n1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.800\n But I think government currencies and other alt coins,\n\n1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:13.080\n I think are shit coins because somebody could click a button\n\n1:45:13.080 --> 1:45:14.960\n and make 10 times the supply.\n\n1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:18.040\n Would it be fair to say that this began\n\n1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:23.120\n with the will for war in World War I?\n\n1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:28.120\n So the march towards fiat began\n\n1:45:30.160 --> 1:45:35.160\n with a global desire for war in the 20th century.\n\n1:45:35.840 --> 1:45:39.680\n Did war start this or was war a result?\n\n1:45:39.680 --> 1:45:40.840\n It's difficult to say really.\n\n1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:42.200\n I think it goes both ways.\n\n1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:47.200\n I think you can't have permanent war without fiat.\n\n1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:51.720\n And I also think there's a case to be made\n\n1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:54.720\n that you can't really have fiat without war.\n\n1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:57.480\n So it's some kind of weird dynamical system\n\n1:45:57.480 --> 1:45:59.360\n with a chicken and egg situation\n\n1:45:59.360 --> 1:46:00.800\n and they build on top of each other\n\n1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:03.000\n and there's a few individuals that figured out\n\n1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.840\n there's a way to manipulate this to play this kind of game\n\n1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:08.840\n and it escalates and nothing gives you the ability\n\n1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:12.200\n to manipulate money quite like war.\n\n1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:15.520\n When you have a war, you can declare an emergency.\n\n1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:19.360\n You can call all the people who oppose you traitors.\n\n1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:23.640\n You can get people to support you\n\n1:46:23.640 --> 1:46:25.400\n not because what you're doing is good\n\n1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:28.240\n but because you play on their sense of tribalism.\n\n1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:31.000\n In your book, you do cost benefit analysis.\n\n1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.240\n So you do acknowledge or think about\n\n1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.440\n the pros of fiat currency.\n\n1:46:35.440 --> 1:46:40.440\n Can you do just that, look at the benefit\n\n1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.880\n and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level?\n\n1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:45.640\n So the way that I write the fiat standard\n\n1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:49.440\n is that I try and analyze it as an engineering system\n\n1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:51.480\n in the same way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard.\n\n1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:52.320\n So with the Bitcoin standard,\n\n1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:54.040\n I looked at Bitcoin from first principles\n\n1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.080\n and tried to explain how it works\n\n1:46:56.080 --> 1:46:59.320\n for a reader that doesn't really have much of a background\n\n1:46:59.320 --> 1:47:03.760\n in computer science, networks or economics.\n\n1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:05.520\n And I thought I'll do the same with the fiat.\n\n1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:07.480\n Let's just ignore the official stories\n\n1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:10.280\n and look at how this thing actually works.\n\n1:47:10.280 --> 1:47:14.000\n And I think it does have value\n\n1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:18.080\n in the fact that the reason that they were able\n\n1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:21.440\n to pull it off is because it was not possible\n\n1:47:21.440 --> 1:47:25.520\n for people who don't want to be part of it\n\n1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:28.000\n to use gold independently of governments.\n\n1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:29.480\n This is really the key thing.\n\n1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:31.840\n Gold is just very expensive to move around.\n\n1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:36.040\n And the fact that it is expensive to move around\n\n1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:41.040\n means that there's inevitably going to emerge institutions\n\n1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:44.280\n where it is centralized in physical location.\n\n1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:47.840\n And then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold.\n\n1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:52.840\n So really the gold standard intrinsically must involve credit\n\n1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:58.120\n as becoming part of the monetary system.\n\n1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:00.840\n It has to be the credit and because it gets centralized\n\n1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:03.080\n it can easily be captured by the government.\n\n1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:06.920\n So to be fair, the benefits of the fiat system\n\n1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:09.520\n is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around,\n\n1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.240\n which is pretty significant.\n\n1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:15.000\n Like generally, moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic\n\n1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.160\n is gonna cost somewhere between 0.1 to 1%\n\n1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:19.920\n of the cost of the gold bar.\n\n1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:22.640\n So you move it 100 times back and forth\n\n1:48:22.640 --> 1:48:25.320\n between the Atlantic, you need to pay the whole gold bar,\n\n1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:28.400\n the cost of the whole gold bar to move it 100 times across.\n\n1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:31.280\n Well, with fiat money, it's essentially government credit.\n\n1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:33.600\n And so it's just sending a message\n\n1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:36.120\n from one central bank to another\n\n1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:38.160\n and you can move it halfway around the world.\n\n1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:41.240\n Is there also something to be said about the cost in time?\n\n1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:42.640\n So you're saving the sort of,\n\n1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:45.920\n you're reducing the friction of the communication as well.\n\n1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:46.760\n Exactly.\n\n1:48:46.760 --> 1:48:47.880\n Of the transactions as well.\n\n1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:49.080\n Exactly, it's faster.\n\n1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:52.000\n How big is that benefit?\n\n1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.280\n Because wouldn't you argue that that potential\n\n1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:56.680\n is the thing that enables modern economy,\n\n1:48:56.680 --> 1:48:58.400\n both the speed and the low cost,\n\n1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:01.240\n so increasing the scale and the frequency,\n\n1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:03.160\n the speed of the transactions?\n\n1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:06.680\n Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard.\n\n1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.160\n However, it isn't as if you couldn't have\n\n1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:12.400\n fast transactions built on top of gold.\n\n1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.360\n So you could have gold being used for final settlement\n\n1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:19.600\n and you could have banks settling with one another\n\n1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:21.040\n essentially using credit settlement.\n\n1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:24.120\n Can you define settlement just for people\n\n1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:25.360\n who are outside of this world?\n\n1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:27.360\n Because we'll mention that word quite a bit probably.\n\n1:49:27.360 --> 1:49:28.200\n Good question.\n\n1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:29.920\n So the way that it works is, let's say right now\n\n1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:35.080\n I'm gonna pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card.\n\n1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:37.040\n So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card\n\n1:49:37.040 --> 1:49:39.960\n within a few seconds that I've sent you the money\n\n1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:41.200\n and then that's yours.\n\n1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:46.200\n But it didn't also happen in those 10 seconds\n\n1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:49.840\n that my bank, which could be in another country,\n\n1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:52.960\n sent the money to your bank into your account.\n\n1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:57.160\n There's a lot of infrastructure underneath that.\n\n1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.160\n So what actually happened is that I have an account\n\n1:49:59.160 --> 1:50:01.600\n with my bank and you have an account with your bank.\n\n1:50:01.600 --> 1:50:05.560\n And when the message is communicated from my app to yours,\n\n1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:07.560\n my bank crosses out the money\n\n1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.080\n and your bank credits you with the money.\n\n1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:13.440\n And then at the end of the day, week or month,\n\n1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:16.560\n banks in the same city will settle with one another,\n\n1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:19.520\n banks in the same country will settle with one another\n\n1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:21.720\n and banks from different countries\n\n1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:22.880\n will settle with one another.\n\n1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:27.040\n So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours.\n\n1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:29.600\n At the end of the day or week or month,\n\n1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:32.200\n they'll tally all of the money that was sent\n\n1:50:32.200 --> 1:50:33.880\n from one bank to the other\n\n1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:35.320\n and then just settle the difference.\n\n1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:37.080\n So it turns out at the end of the month,\n\n1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:40.440\n my bank had sent $15 million to your bank\n\n1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:43.480\n and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank.\n\n1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:46.840\n So they give them $1 million and that settles it,\n\n1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.920\n that finalizes the transaction.\n\n1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:51.680\n So final settlement 3D is like the,\n\n1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:54.640\n you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system.\n\n1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:56.840\n And then you can think of these things\n\n1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:59.360\n as being the higher layer levels.\n\n1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:01.080\n And you had a wonderful discussion about that\n\n1:51:01.080 --> 1:51:02.720\n with Michael Saylor.\n\n1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:05.960\n So the final settlement is like the moment\n\n1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:09.960\n when you paper and ideas connect to physical reality.\n\n1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:13.760\n Or to some representation of physical reality.\n\n1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:15.560\n Yeah, and under gold,\n\n1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:17.720\n everything was tethered to physical reality\n\n1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:19.080\n because there was a market commodity\n\n1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:20.520\n at the bottom of all of this\n\n1:51:20.520 --> 1:51:22.440\n and nobody could print that market commodity.\n\n1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:23.960\n And so at the end of the month,\n\n1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:26.240\n if your bank made too many payments,\n\n1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:29.040\n if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning.\n\n1:51:29.040 --> 1:51:33.040\n If you were reckless, if you were insolvent,\n\n1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:34.440\n you went out of business.\n\n1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:37.640\n So there was no way to fool that.\n\n1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:39.840\n But then we moved to the fiat century\n\n1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:41.840\n and everything is credit.\n\n1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:42.680\n At the end of the day,\n\n1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:45.680\n the final layer is government credit.\n\n1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:48.600\n And so as long as you're friends with the government,\n\n1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.280\n basically you never go bankrupt.\n\n1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:54.200\n So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way\n\n1:51:54.200 --> 1:51:58.840\n into getting into position where they don't get bankrupt.\n\n1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:03.000\n So in part two of the fiat standard called Fiat Life,\n\n1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.640\n you describe the effects of fiat money\n\n1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:08.880\n on a bunch of things like life, food, science, education.\n\n1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:14.040\n What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money\n\n1:52:14.040 --> 1:52:15.440\n on our world, on our life?\n\n1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.160\n So taking a step outside of the monetary system,\n\n1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:21.800\n actually like how that affects our life from this book?\n\n1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:23.480\n I mean, there's a whole bunch of things\n\n1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:25.440\n and I won't be able to go over them\n\n1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:26.840\n and I highly recommend reading the book.\n\n1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:28.520\n But if I were to pick one,\n\n1:52:28.520 --> 1:52:29.880\n I would say it's the impact that it has\n\n1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:33.640\n on our time preference, on our valuation of the future.\n\n1:52:33.640 --> 1:52:35.680\n So remember when we started the discussion,\n\n1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:38.840\n I said that the key function of money\n\n1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.400\n is that it serves as a store of value.\n\n1:52:41.400 --> 1:52:42.920\n And the harder the money is,\n\n1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:45.240\n the better it is at providing us\n\n1:52:45.240 --> 1:52:48.160\n with a way for providing for our future.\n\n1:52:48.160 --> 1:52:49.800\n And so the harder the money is,\n\n1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:51.320\n the less we discount the future.\n\n1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:53.200\n We always discount the future compared to the present.\n\n1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:56.200\n So if I told you, I'm gonna give you something today\n\n1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:58.640\n versus giving it to you 10 years from now,\n\n1:52:58.640 --> 1:53:00.840\n the same thing, you would prefer to take it now\n\n1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:03.240\n because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next 10 years.\n\n1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:06.520\n So we always prefer the present to the future.\n\n1:53:06.520 --> 1:53:09.080\n There's always a discount on the future.\n\n1:53:09.080 --> 1:53:10.920\n And that discount is called time preference.\n\n1:53:10.920 --> 1:53:13.600\n The degree to which we prefer the present to the future\n\n1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:15.400\n is called our time preference.\n\n1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:18.960\n So the higher our time preference,\n\n1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:20.840\n the less we care about the future.\n\n1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:22.200\n And the process of civilization\n\n1:53:22.200 --> 1:53:24.680\n is the process of lowering our time preference,\n\n1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:26.600\n where we start caring more for the future,\n\n1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:29.680\n we start prioritizing the present less and less.\n\n1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:32.880\n So we start being able to not consume everything\n\n1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:34.800\n that we have and store it.\n\n1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.640\n And so money is essential for that.\n\n1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:38.640\n And under the gold standard,\n\n1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:40.680\n everyone in the world had the ability\n\n1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:42.360\n to provide for their future\n\n1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:44.400\n by simply using the same money that they use.\n\n1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:47.560\n You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin\n\n1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:49.080\n and you could take that gold coin\n\n1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:51.720\n and keep it safe for 10 years\n\n1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:54.000\n and know that at the end of those 10 years,\n\n1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.720\n that gold coin would buy you slightly more\n\n1:53:56.720 --> 1:53:59.400\n than what it bought you the day that you earned it.\n\n1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:01.480\n So anybody could provide for their future\n\n1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:04.640\n and anybody could have very high degree of certainty\n\n1:54:04.640 --> 1:54:08.160\n that whatever they're saving is going to be there\n\n1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:10.320\n when they want it in the future.\n\n1:54:10.320 --> 1:54:12.000\n Because the money supply was only increasing\n\n1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:13.480\n at one and a half percent,\n\n1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:16.880\n whereas the production of goods and services\n\n1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:21.040\n was increasing for most cases, for most periods\n\n1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:22.160\n at a higher rate than that.\n\n1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:24.480\n So you could buy more apples and oranges\n\n1:54:24.480 --> 1:54:27.720\n and houses and cars at the end of the 10 years\n\n1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:29.240\n than you could at the beginning of the 10 years.\n\n1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:31.200\n So everybody had a way of providing for the future.\n\n1:54:31.200 --> 1:54:34.280\n And with that, people lower their time preference.\n\n1:54:34.280 --> 1:54:38.280\n And that is reflected across all aspects of life.\n\n1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:40.080\n I think it's not just the economic thing.\n\n1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:41.480\n You see it in the savings rate,\n\n1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:44.920\n the ability to deny yourself gratification today.\n\n1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:46.400\n I could take the money that I have\n\n1:54:46.400 --> 1:54:50.560\n and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht.\n\n1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:52.960\n And yet you decided, I'm not going to do that.\n\n1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.360\n I'm going to keep it so that tomorrow\n\n1:54:54.360 --> 1:54:57.240\n I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht\n\n1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:01.280\n or have a better life or give my children a better life.\n\n1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:03.880\n So all of human civilization really\n\n1:55:03.880 --> 1:55:06.680\n is the process of us lowering our time preference\n\n1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:09.120\n and finding harder monies that allow us\n\n1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.960\n to provide better for the future\n\n1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:15.200\n is how we really technologically we do that.\n\n1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:17.720\n I think of the hardness of money\n\n1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:20.760\n as being the control knob for our time preference.\n\n1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:23.520\n And you can see this reflected in the 20th century\n\n1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:26.120\n where we go from the money supply increases\n\n1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:28.840\n at around one and a half percent under gold\n\n1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:31.440\n to this current situation where over the last 60 years\n\n1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:34.440\n I ran the numbers on money supply and fiat,\n\n1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:36.360\n the global fiat supply has increased\n\n1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:38.000\n at around 14% per year.\n\n1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.280\n So we've done a 10X in the increase\n\n1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:43.000\n in the supply of money annually.\n\n1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.280\n And 14% is a weighted average.\n\n1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:48.400\n So if you take a basic numerical average\n\n1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:52.000\n for all fiat currencies, you get something like 30%.\n\n1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.000\n The average fiat currency increases by 30%.\n\n1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.720\n But if you value it by the volume of each currency\n\n1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:00.160\n so that you're not giving equal weight\n\n1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:04.880\n to the Venezuelan Bolivar increasing at 500% a year\n\n1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:07.000\n and the dollar increasing at 8% a year,\n\n1:56:07.920 --> 1:56:10.480\n if you do it by value of the currencies\n\n1:56:10.480 --> 1:56:12.120\n so that you get the total supply of fiat,\n\n1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:13.720\n it's something like 14%.\n\n1:56:13.720 --> 1:56:15.440\n And weighted is 30% you said?\n\n1:56:15.440 --> 1:56:16.880\n Yeah, 30%.\n\n1:56:16.880 --> 1:56:17.720\n It's insane.\n\n1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:19.040\n I'd like to see the worst ones,\n\n1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:22.320\n the people that are tracking that average up.\n\n1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:23.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:25.560\n But 14% is still an incredibly high, high number.\n\n1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:27.440\n And so you're saying that,\n\n1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:29.240\n sorry, that's the average over the century\n\n1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:30.080\n or the past 100 years?\n\n1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.200\n Over the past 60 years, 1960 to 2020,\n\n1:56:32.200 --> 1:56:34.040\n we get World Bank data on that,\n\n1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:35.640\n pretty reliable data on World Bank\n\n1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:38.640\n and European Union OECD data.\n\n1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:40.680\n I ran the numbers on that weighted average,\n\n1:56:40.680 --> 1:56:42.120\n something like 14%.\n\n1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:45.240\n And what effect that has on time preference?\n\n1:56:45.240 --> 1:56:47.880\n The effect is now it's much, much, much harder\n\n1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:50.080\n for everybody to provide for their future.\n\n1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:52.240\n Everywhere in the world, it's much harder.\n\n1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:56.640\n So how do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin\n\n1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:58.080\n that I could just put under my mattress\n\n1:56:58.080 --> 1:56:59.720\n and expect it to be there 10 years from now?\n\n1:56:59.720 --> 1:57:01.440\n Well, gold itself isn't cutting it.\n\n1:57:01.440 --> 1:57:03.400\n Gold can't keep up with inflation.\n\n1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:06.120\n And the reason for that is that gold is not being used\n\n1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:11.120\n as a money anymore in that you can't send it internationally.\n\n1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:13.120\n Internationally, you can't use it\n\n1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:14.760\n to settle trade internationally,\n\n1:57:14.760 --> 1:57:18.720\n which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited.\n\n1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:23.400\n And so it's becoming more and more an industrial metal.\n\n1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:26.840\n And as a result of the fact that its value\n\n1:57:26.840 --> 1:57:28.040\n doesn't keep up with inflation,\n\n1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:30.120\n it becomes economical to use it in industry.\n\n1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:32.760\n So we're seeing gold become like silver\n\n1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:34.400\n in that it gets used in industry.\n\n1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:36.280\n So the stockpile declines.\n\n1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:38.720\n And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well,\n\n1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:41.000\n and it becomes more and more of an industrial metal.\n\n1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.960\n And it can't protect your wealth over time very well.\n\n1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:45.960\n So what do you do?\n\n1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:47.400\n Well, you could invest.\n\n1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:49.040\n And this is kind of the obvious answer\n\n1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:50.560\n that Keynesian will give you is,\n\n1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:52.960\n well, you just put your money in an investment.\n\n1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:55.120\n But investment is different from saving.\n\n1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:56.560\n Saving, the whole point of saving\n\n1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:57.840\n is that the thing is liquid\n\n1:57:57.840 --> 1:58:00.240\n and that the thing carries little uncertainty.\n\n1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:03.800\n You just held the gold coin and it just sat there.\n\n1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:04.640\n It did nothing.\n\n1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:05.840\n It didn't take risk.\n\n1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:07.680\n You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years.\n\n1:58:07.680 --> 1:58:10.840\n Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody\n\n1:58:10.840 --> 1:58:13.040\n to go and do something with it.\n\n1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:14.480\n And it could work, it could not work.\n\n1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:16.600\n If it works, you get a positive return.\n\n1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:18.160\n You get more gold back.\n\n1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.200\n If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back.\n\n1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:24.480\n So taking on risk is something very different from saving.\n\n1:58:24.480 --> 1:58:27.000\n Saving is just a way of buying the future.\n\n1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.480\n Investing is taking on a risk\n\n1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:31.280\n and you could lose everything with it.\n\n1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:33.280\n So what ends up happening,\n\n1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:35.520\n and this is the Keynesian objection I think\n\n1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:39.760\n is very wrong and bad\n\n1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:44.080\n because investment is a job in itself.\n\n1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:46.000\n To figure out what to do with your money\n\n1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.160\n in order to beat inflation is something\n\n1:58:49.160 --> 1:58:52.160\n that there are professionals out there on Wall Street\n\n1:58:52.160 --> 1:58:55.680\n that have PhDs in finance, that have enormous computers,\n\n1:58:55.680 --> 1:58:59.600\n and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees\n\n1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:01.560\n and math nerds that are crunching numbers\n\n1:59:01.560 --> 1:59:04.200\n and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio\n\n1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:05.600\n so that you can beat inflation.\n\n1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:06.440\n And guess what?\n\n1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:08.560\n The majority of them don't beat inflation.\n\n1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:10.440\n The majority of them can't beat inflation.\n\n1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:13.480\n Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent,\n\n1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:14.880\n but if you remember.\n\n1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:15.720\n 14%.\n\n1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:18.920\n Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%,\n\n1:59:18.920 --> 1:59:21.120\n like if you look at just the increase in the money supply,\n\n1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:23.160\n which I think is a much better metric.\n\n1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:25.440\n And this is what's reflected on the desirable goods.\n\n1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:27.120\n Like if you look at the price of real estate\n\n1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:30.200\n in Miami Beach, as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example,\n\n1:59:30.200 --> 1:59:32.840\n it goes up at around 6, 7% per year on average\n\n1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:34.640\n over the last century.\n\n1:59:34.640 --> 1:59:38.160\n So that's, if you wanna live in a nice area,\n\n1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:39.480\n that's what happening to real estate.\n\n1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:41.000\n If you wanna go to the good universities,\n\n1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:41.840\n that's what's going up.\n\n1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:43.120\n It's going up at a rate that's similar\n\n1:59:43.120 --> 1:59:44.960\n to the increase in the money supply.\n\n1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:47.320\n And you can beat CPI,\n\n1:59:47.320 --> 1:59:50.360\n but CPI is designed so you can beat it,\n\n1:59:50.360 --> 1:59:52.760\n but you can't really beat the appreciation\n\n1:59:52.760 --> 1:59:54.480\n in the things that you actually want to buy,\n\n1:59:54.480 --> 1:59:57.120\n in the price of good food, the price of good real estate.\n\n1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:01.720\n So, and most investment professionals fail at doing that.\n\n2:00:01.720 --> 2:00:06.520\n So what hope does a doctor or an engineer or a scientist\n\n2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:08.800\n or an athlete have in doing those things?\n\n2:00:08.800 --> 2:00:11.760\n And investment is hard and saving should be easy.\n\n2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:12.600\n Exactly.\n\n2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:15.800\n Saving is essential for us as a civilization.\n\n2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:18.920\n And what fiat did is it took that away from us.\n\n2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:22.240\n And then it forced everybody to become an investor\n\n2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:25.720\n or more accurately a gambler, because you're not just even,\n\n2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:27.560\n because the money itself is broken,\n\n2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:30.320\n because the money itself is constantly changing in value,\n\n2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:33.000\n investing is becoming more of a crapshoot.\n\n2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:36.400\n I mean, value investing is completely underperforming,\n\n2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:38.400\n compared to market analysis.\n\n2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:40.480\n You know, you listen to the Fed,\n\n2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:45.480\n and what matters to the price of individual companies\n\n2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:48.480\n is monetary policy much more\n\n2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:50.120\n than it is their own performance.\n\n2:00:50.120 --> 2:00:52.440\n So basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed\n\n2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:54.040\n and following all of the world's central banks.\n\n2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:55.760\n And yeah, I need to learn macro economics\n\n2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:58.880\n and you need to learn what all the central banks are doing.\n\n2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:00.880\n And you need to understand how commodity markets work.\n\n2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:02.760\n And you need to understand how equity markets work\n\n2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:05.360\n and bond markets and real estate markets.\n\n2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:07.080\n You need to do all of those things\n\n2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:10.400\n just in order to be able to save and earn\n\n2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:13.280\n and keep the money that you've already earned.\n\n2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:14.800\n That's the criminal thing about it.\n\n2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:17.640\n Like I've already earned that money being a doctor,\n\n2:01:17.640 --> 2:01:19.640\n being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer.\n\n2:01:19.640 --> 2:01:22.600\n I built a house for somebody and I got that money.\n\n2:01:22.600 --> 2:01:24.240\n And all I wanna do is just make sure\n\n2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.800\n that I can have it 10 years from now.\n\n2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:29.280\n The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer\n\n2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:30.760\n because you have to spend half your time\n\n2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:34.640\n not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time\n\n2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:37.320\n learning about Japanese central bank monetary policy\n\n2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:40.160\n and commodity markets and what's gonna happen to copper\n\n2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:41.720\n and what's gonna happen to oil\n\n2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:44.600\n and what's happening in the wars\n\n2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:46.360\n and what's happening with foreign policy\n\n2:01:46.360 --> 2:01:50.080\n and Russia and the US and all of those things.\n\n2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:52.920\n Under the gold standard,\n\n2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:54.440\n you didn't care about any of that stuff.\n\n2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:56.840\n Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things.\n\n2:01:56.840 --> 2:01:59.120\n So what this means is the future,\n\n2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:01.400\n so first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned,\n\n2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:04.760\n but also it means that the future becomes\n\n2:02:04.760 --> 2:02:05.720\n much more uncertain.\n\n2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:08.840\n So you're far less likely to provide for yourself\n\n2:02:08.840 --> 2:02:09.680\n 10 years from now,\n\n2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:11.240\n far less likely to find an easy way\n\n2:02:11.240 --> 2:02:14.880\n to give yourself value 10 years from now.\n\n2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.120\n And so you become more short termist.\n\n2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:18.560\n And that is reflected economically\n\n2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:22.120\n in a lower savings rate and we see savings rates decline,\n\n2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.200\n but it is also reflected in all manners of decision making.\n\n2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:27.600\n And I think if you really wanna see what it is,\n\n2:02:27.600 --> 2:02:30.840\n take a look at a society that goes through hyperinflation\n\n2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:32.560\n and look at what happens there.\n\n2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:36.680\n How do people change under hyperinflation\n\n2:02:36.680 --> 2:02:39.800\n and compare that to essentially what we see\n\n2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:43.440\n in the 20th century all over under not hyperinflation,\n\n2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:45.080\n but under low inflation,\n\n2:02:45.080 --> 2:02:49.600\n 10, 15% that you see across the board most of the time\n\n2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:51.840\n is just slow motion hyperinflation.\n\n2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:53.400\n So what happens in hyperinflation?\n\n2:02:53.400 --> 2:02:54.960\n Everybody gets their paychecks,\n\n2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:56.880\n they run straight to the supermarket,\n\n2:02:56.880 --> 2:02:58.520\n they spend all of their money.\n\n2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.240\n Nobody thinks about savings.\n\n2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:01.840\n Nobody thinks about the future.\n\n2:03:01.840 --> 2:03:05.960\n Survival until the end of this month is highly uncertain.\n\n2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:07.560\n How likely are you to be planning\n\n2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:10.200\n for what you're going to be doing five years from now?\n\n2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:12.240\n Very unlikely.\n\n2:03:12.240 --> 2:03:15.320\n But also it's reflected not just economically,\n\n2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:17.600\n it's also reflected in all aspects of morality\n\n2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:19.160\n and all the way in which we deal\n\n2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:20.960\n with each other as human beings.\n\n2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:23.560\n When your survival is precarious,\n\n2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:26.280\n how much are you invested in the notion\n\n2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:29.760\n of being a good citizen, on caring about your reputation,\n\n2:03:29.760 --> 2:03:32.800\n on caring about not getting caught in a crime?\n\n2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:35.760\n All of these things become harder to value.\n\n2:03:35.760 --> 2:03:37.160\n So people start committing crime,\n\n2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:39.840\n people start caring less and less about the future.\n\n2:03:39.840 --> 2:03:41.280\n And we see it reflected in everything.\n\n2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:43.920\n And I argue, you see it reflected in architecture.\n\n2:03:43.920 --> 2:03:45.760\n We used to build houses in the 19th century\n\n2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:47.600\n that last until today.\n\n2:03:47.600 --> 2:03:48.720\n And then in the 20th century,\n\n2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:51.680\n we build essentially disposable cardboard boxes\n\n2:03:51.680 --> 2:03:54.400\n that get scrapped in 20 years.\n\n2:03:54.400 --> 2:03:57.720\n So what can you say about potential positive effects\n\n2:03:57.720 --> 2:03:59.080\n of lower time preferences?\n\n2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:00.520\n So I mean, it's a balance.\n\n2:04:00.520 --> 2:04:04.400\n Like basically, you're talking about\n\n2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:05.800\n an average kind of time preference,\n\n2:04:05.800 --> 2:04:07.360\n but there's some things in life\n\n2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:10.600\n where low time preference could be a negative thing.\n\n2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:13.720\n So like if I want to take on risk,\n\n2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:15.920\n not for investment, for a kind of investment,\n\n2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:18.160\n but say I want to start a business,\n\n2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:20.720\n I want to take something crazy,\n\n2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:24.000\n take a leap into the unknown, be an entrepreneur.\n\n2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.840\n What can you say about that kind of leap?\n\n2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:28.880\n Taking on debt.\n\n2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:31.840\n What's the value of that within the current system?\n\n2:04:31.840 --> 2:04:32.960\n What's the right approach to that\n\n2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:33.840\n within the current system?\n\n2:04:33.840 --> 2:04:35.360\n What's the right approach overall\n\n2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:37.080\n from an economics perspective?\n\n2:04:37.080 --> 2:04:39.400\n So it's not saving for the future.\n\n2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:43.560\n It's doing something wild,\n\n2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:46.800\n taking the money from your mattress, taking on debt,\n\n2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:48.680\n and having a dream in your heart\n\n2:04:48.680 --> 2:04:50.800\n that you somehow just want to do.\n\n2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:52.960\n Maybe it's not the wisest investment decision,\n\n2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:55.720\n but it's something, you know, it's being human.\n\n2:04:55.720 --> 2:04:58.600\n It's taking a leap into the unknown\n\n2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:00.680\n because something in your heart says to do it.\n\n2:05:00.680 --> 2:05:02.280\n I think you're more likely to be taking the leap\n\n2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:04.400\n in the unknown when you have a little bit of gold\n\n2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:06.320\n in the mattress than when you don't.\n\n2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:07.360\n I think this is the thing.\n\n2:05:07.360 --> 2:05:10.040\n Like if you look at the late 19th century,\n\n2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:11.920\n and I discussed this in the Bitcoin standard,\n\n2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:14.960\n that was arguably the most innovative period\n\n2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.280\n in human history.\n\n2:05:16.280 --> 2:05:17.960\n You know, there's qualitative evidence.\n\n2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:20.240\n You know, look at the world around you today.\n\n2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:21.600\n Pretty much everything that we use\n\n2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:23.200\n was invented in that period.\n\n2:05:23.200 --> 2:05:28.200\n The car, the airplane, the telegraph, the telephone,\n\n2:05:30.800 --> 2:05:35.800\n the camera, pretty much modern life as late 19th century.\n\n2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:38.840\n You know, the period between 1870 and 1914,\n\n2:05:38.840 --> 2:05:41.560\n because the whole world was practically on a gold standard,\n\n2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.720\n the whole world was using the same money,\n\n2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:46.440\n and the whole world could save in the same currency.\n\n2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:49.000\n That meant that a bicycle shop owner,\n\n2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.160\n two bicycle shop owning brothers in North Carolina\n\n2:05:52.160 --> 2:05:53.880\n could go and try and fly,\n\n2:05:53.880 --> 2:05:57.320\n even as all the scientific experts in 1903\n\n2:05:57.320 --> 2:06:01.360\n were confirming that the possibility of flight\n\n2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:03.760\n has been debunked as unscientific.\n\n2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:05.280\n You know, Lord Kelvin said,\n\n2:06:05.280 --> 2:06:07.640\n not in a million years we're going to be flying.\n\n2:06:07.640 --> 2:06:09.520\n Thomas Edison said it's never gonna happen.\n\n2:06:09.520 --> 2:06:11.160\n No, I think it was Edison who said a million years,\n\n2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:14.040\n but Kelvin also said it's never gonna happen.\n\n2:06:14.040 --> 2:06:16.440\n The New York Times said it's never gonna happen\n\n2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:20.000\n the same month in which the Wright brothers did it.\n\n2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.400\n And they continued to deny that it was gonna happen\n\n2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:24.160\n even two years after they did it.\n\n2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:27.880\n But that's, why could they do that?\n\n2:06:27.880 --> 2:06:29.480\n Because they had savings in gold.\n\n2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:33.400\n They had the security with something that you know\n\n2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:34.640\n is gonna be there.\n\n2:06:34.640 --> 2:06:37.080\n And then you can take a risk with the stuff that is extra.\n\n2:06:37.080 --> 2:06:40.760\n You know, I have say three years expenditures in gold\n\n2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:42.240\n under my mattress.\n\n2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:45.000\n And I know that I could take a risk with everything else\n\n2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:48.320\n because whatever bad things happen with all of my dreams,\n\n2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:51.640\n like even, you know, flying, think about how insane that is.\n\n2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:54.280\n I still can go back to the three years of gold\n\n2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:55.120\n that I have saved.\n\n2:06:55.120 --> 2:06:57.000\n It's still okay to take on debt\n\n2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.760\n given the stuff, the gold under the mattress.\n\n2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:00.920\n Well, this is the thing, under the gold standard,\n\n2:07:00.920 --> 2:07:02.560\n the way that people finance things\n\n2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:04.880\n was predominantly with capital, with equity.\n\n2:07:04.880 --> 2:07:07.360\n So you would, because you had gold savings,\n\n2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:09.720\n I had gold savings, everybody had gold savings.\n\n2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:11.840\n When you wanted to start the business,\n\n2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:14.440\n you could use your own savings or somebody else's savings.\n\n2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:18.040\n So you didn't need to get into debt.\n\n2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:19.960\n Well, you could get equity from others\n\n2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:21.680\n and you could also get debt from others.\n\n2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:22.520\n So there was.\n\n2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:25.440\n But it's directly mapped to physical reality.\n\n2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:27.520\n Yeah, it's directly mapped to economic reality\n\n2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:28.960\n and that there's a hard money out there\n\n2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:31.160\n that, you know, what you're spending money,\n\n2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:34.000\n you know, you wanna build your airplane factory,\n\n2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:35.640\n you need to get actual resources.\n\n2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:38.360\n So you get actual gold, either yours or somebody else's,\n\n2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:40.400\n you borrow it or you give them equity,\n\n2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:42.200\n but there's real resources.\n\n2:07:42.200 --> 2:07:43.680\n Now, what happened with the fiat system?\n\n2:07:43.680 --> 2:07:45.760\n And this is, you know, the first part of the book\n\n2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:48.400\n where I look at it from an engineering kind of perspective\n\n2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:50.840\n is essentially, and I think this is like the breakthrough\n\n2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:53.720\n inside of the book, what fiat does\n\n2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:58.200\n is that it replaces gold mining with credit creation.\n\n2:07:59.480 --> 2:08:01.560\n The way that we make fiat money,\n\n2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:04.080\n the way that fiat is mined into existence\n\n2:08:04.080 --> 2:08:05.200\n is through credit creation.\n\n2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:06.400\n Most people think of fiat money\n\n2:08:06.400 --> 2:08:07.320\n as being something that happens\n\n2:08:07.320 --> 2:08:08.800\n when government prints money.\n\n2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:11.440\n And we still use the term government's printing money,\n\n2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:14.480\n but the vast majority of fiat is not physical.\n\n2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:16.200\n And in fact, fiat is not created\n\n2:08:16.200 --> 2:08:18.080\n when it is printed physically,\n\n2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:19.960\n it's created when it is lent.\n\n2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:22.840\n So when you go to a bank to get a $1 million loan\n\n2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:25.800\n to buy a house, that bank is not gonna give you\n\n2:08:25.800 --> 2:08:27.520\n a million dollars from their own money\n\n2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:29.480\n or from their depositor's money.\n\n2:08:29.480 --> 2:08:32.080\n They're gonna make a fresh new million dollars.\n\n2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:34.320\n When you walk out of that bank,\n\n2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:36.760\n the money supply has increased by $1 million\n\n2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:38.680\n to finance your home.\n\n2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:41.680\n So what fiat does is, I mean,\n\n2:08:41.680 --> 2:08:44.520\n it was basically born out of government credit\n\n2:08:44.520 --> 2:08:46.840\n and the credit of banks that are backed\n\n2:08:46.840 --> 2:08:48.960\n by the central bank and the government.\n\n2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:51.240\n So if you're part of the institutions\n\n2:08:51.240 --> 2:08:53.320\n that are allowed fiat privilege,\n\n2:08:53.320 --> 2:08:56.520\n where you can just issue loans backed by the central bank,\n\n2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:57.960\n backed by the currency,\n\n2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:00.120\n you are effectively creating new currency,\n\n2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:02.360\n new money every time you issue the loan.\n\n2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:05.360\n That's fiat mining is credit creation, I love it.\n\n2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:07.520\n So can you say something, I mean,\n\n2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:10.720\n you can't really have credit without a demand for credit.\n\n2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:12.440\n You can't really have an increase in supply\n\n2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:14.120\n without a demand for it.\n\n2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:18.920\n Is there any value you place in the humans wanting it?\n\n2:09:18.920 --> 2:09:22.720\n Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit,\n\n2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:25.280\n wanting to take big leaps, big risks,\n\n2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:27.840\n big entrepreneurial decisions.\n\n2:09:27.840 --> 2:09:31.240\n So is all credit bad?\n\n2:09:31.240 --> 2:09:36.240\n No, I think what's bad is anything, in my opinion,\n\n2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:38.400\n anything that is consensual,\n\n2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:40.600\n I wanna borrow money from you and we agree the terms,\n\n2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:41.840\n I can't object to that.\n\n2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:46.080\n As long as you and I both agree, I can't object to that.\n\n2:09:46.080 --> 2:09:48.800\n But in the case of the fiat system,\n\n2:09:48.800 --> 2:09:51.960\n it's not just you and the bank who come to an agreement.\n\n2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.600\n Everybody who uses the currency\n\n2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:55.800\n is forced to be part of that agreement.\n\n2:09:55.800 --> 2:09:57.640\n Because if you default,\n\n2:09:57.640 --> 2:10:00.400\n effectively what's protecting the bank from you\n\n2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:01.760\n is the fact that the government\n\n2:10:01.760 --> 2:10:04.720\n can just print a bunch of money and make the bank whole.\n\n2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:06.480\n So effectively.\n\n2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:07.320\n Interesting.\n\n2:10:07.320 --> 2:10:11.520\n So that little agreement between the bank and you\n\n2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:14.200\n is actually an agreement between the bank, you,\n\n2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.440\n and the entire populace that's using the currency.\n\n2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:17.280\n Exactly.\n\n2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:19.720\n They're forced to provide the safety net for you and me\n\n2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:21.360\n to go and make that loan.\n\n2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:24.040\n And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency.\n\n2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:28.200\n That's how the whole thing actually works.\n\n2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:30.960\n So this is why I wrote the Bitcoin standard,\n\n2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:31.800\n explaining Bitcoin,\n\n2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:34.160\n and basically the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard\n\n2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:36.600\n is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can,\n\n2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:38.720\n because this is the best money that has ever been invented.\n\n2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:39.960\n And we'll talk about that,\n\n2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:42.760\n why Bitcoin is the hardest money.\n\n2:10:42.760 --> 2:10:43.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:45.600\n But with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard,\n\n2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:47.560\n and again, this is not financial advice,\n\n2:10:47.560 --> 2:10:49.760\n I'm a lowly academic,\n\n2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.680\n you shouldn't listen to me on issues of money,\n\n2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:54.320\n but I think theoretically and intellectually,\n\n2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:55.640\n the conclusion of the fiat system\n\n2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:58.840\n is you need to be short fiat as much as you can.\n\n2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:00.160\n That's the smart winning move.\n\n2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:04.480\n So human wisdom over thousands of years is to save,\n\n2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.160\n try and not borrow as much as you can,\n\n2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:08.440\n try and accumulate as much savings as you can.\n\n2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:09.800\n That's reversed under fiat.\n\n2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:11.680\n If you're saving money,\n\n2:11:11.680 --> 2:11:14.720\n you're just subsidizing everybody else taking on loans.\n\n2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:16.200\n If you're taking on loans,\n\n2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:18.880\n you're benefiting from all the people that are borrowing.\n\n2:11:18.880 --> 2:11:21.000\n So the winning move under the fiat system,\n\n2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:23.720\n and this is what rich people do, is you borrow.\n\n2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:25.560\n Rich people under the fiat monetary system,\n\n2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:27.240\n they don't hold assets.\n\n2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:30.680\n If you're worth a billion dollars today,\n\n2:11:30.680 --> 2:11:33.440\n you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account.\n\n2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:36.240\n You've got maybe a hundred thousand, a million,\n\n2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:39.280\n five million or something like that.\n\n2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:41.720\n A tiny fraction of your money is held in cash.\n\n2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:43.640\n The majority is going to be held\n\n2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:46.160\n in all kinds of other hard assets.\n\n2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:48.120\n And you're gonna be borrowing.\n\n2:11:48.120 --> 2:11:49.640\n The richest people in the world\n\n2:11:49.640 --> 2:11:50.920\n are the biggest borrowers in the world.\n\n2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:52.440\n The most powerful entities in the world,\n\n2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:54.960\n the governments are the biggest borrowers in the world.\n\n2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:57.920\n And that's how they are the richest and the most powerful,\n\n2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:00.120\n because every time you're borrowing,\n\n2:12:00.120 --> 2:12:03.640\n you're giving the bank an excuse to print new money.\n\n2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:05.480\n So you're devaluing everybody else's money\n\n2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:06.880\n and you're getting a bit of the cut.\n\n2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:10.080\n If you were going to buy a house with your savings,\n\n2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:13.040\n you're accumulating the savings and they're losing value.\n\n2:12:13.040 --> 2:12:17.920\n And if I were to go buy the same house with credit,\n\n2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:21.400\n I'm getting the bank to print money for me.\n\n2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:23.680\n So obviously they can cut me in on that deal.\n\n2:12:23.680 --> 2:12:24.960\n And that's why it's much cheaper\n\n2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:26.400\n for everybody to buy with credit.\n\n2:12:26.400 --> 2:12:29.120\n That's why everybody buys everything on credit.\n\n2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:31.400\n So when we look at the global monetary system,\n\n2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:34.280\n the thing you wanna do as a government\n\n2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.480\n is be the sexiest currency out there.\n\n2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:42.480\n So the main currency, like the dollar currently is,\n\n2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:46.000\n is the one that has the most power in that kind of context.\n\n2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000\n So you have, if you were to try to summarize\n\n2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:53.040\n what is the global monetary system as it is today,\n\n2:12:53.040 --> 2:12:57.800\n is a bunch of fiat currencies battling for position,\n\n2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:02.800\n for use outside their nation,\n\n2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:05.400\n and in so doing trying to gain power\n\n2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:06.600\n in the geopolitical sense.\n\n2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:08.440\n Is that, if we just zoom out,\n\n2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:11.120\n what is the global monetary system?\n\n2:13:11.120 --> 2:13:14.000\n Like how, what is it currently?\n\n2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:15.960\n So outside of the United States, the whole thing.\n\n2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:18.520\n Yeah, you could say that, but I think it's more realistic\n\n2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:19.960\n looking at how it has actually evolved\n\n2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:21.600\n over the past few decades.\n\n2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:23.200\n It's really a dollar system.\n\n2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:26.440\n It's not a system of currencies buying with one another.\n\n2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:28.400\n It's a dollar system, and all other currencies\n\n2:13:28.400 --> 2:13:30.480\n are just basically, I like to call them dollar\n\n2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:32.040\n plus country risk.\n\n2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:34.240\n So each.\n\n2:13:34.240 --> 2:13:36.400\n It always returns home to the dollar.\n\n2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:37.960\n Yeah, there is no competition.\n\n2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:41.360\n There is no second best, as Michael Saylor would say.\n\n2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:42.640\n And money is like that.\n\n2:13:42.640 --> 2:13:46.520\n Gold was a winner take all by the end of the 19th century.\n\n2:13:46.520 --> 2:13:49.160\n The global monetary market is effectively\n\n2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:51.560\n a winner take all for the dollar.\n\n2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:54.400\n And if we get it to Bitcoin, you'll know,\n\n2:13:54.400 --> 2:13:57.320\n I also think digital currencies are also going to be\n\n2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:59.280\n a winner take all situation.\n\n2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:01.840\n So money wants to be one.\n\n2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:04.120\n In fact, there is no such thing as multiple currencies.\n\n2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:07.280\n Multiple currencies is just a step back to barter.\n\n2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:08.800\n Money is one.\n\n2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:11.080\n If you go back to a system of several currencies,\n\n2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:13.160\n you're just reinventing barter.\n\n2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:16.160\n So in the case of the dollar system,\n\n2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:19.760\n the global dollar system is built around the dollar\n\n2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:23.280\n because all central banks have dollar reserves\n\n2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:24.880\n and because all central banks use\n\n2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:26.680\n the dollar's clearing mechanisms.\n\n2:14:26.680 --> 2:14:30.440\n So that's why you're basically playing in the dollar system.\n\n2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:33.640\n This seems to have changed over the last couple of months\n\n2:14:33.640 --> 2:14:35.560\n with the sanctions on Russia\n\n2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:37.760\n and the confiscation of Russian reserves.\n\n2:14:37.760 --> 2:14:40.840\n It remains to be seen what that's going to do\n\n2:14:40.840 --> 2:14:42.520\n and how that's going to change.\n\n2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:47.280\n But it is looking like this dollar system\n\n2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:48.720\n is clearly unsustainable.\n\n2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:49.920\n It's not sustainable for the US.\n\n2:14:49.920 --> 2:14:51.840\n It's not sustainable for anybody.\n\n2:14:51.840 --> 2:14:56.440\n Speaking of which, so you do an amazing podcast\n\n2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:58.680\n called the Bitcoin Standard Podcast.\n\n2:14:58.680 --> 2:15:01.640\n So episode 108 of that podcast\n\n2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:03.920\n is about the very thing you just mentioned.\n\n2:15:03.920 --> 2:15:06.480\n And allow me please to read the description of that\n\n2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:07.960\n and then ask you a couple questions\n\n2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:09.680\n about your thoughts in general.\n\n2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:11.120\n The description reads,\n\n2:15:11.120 --> 2:15:13.600\n after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\n\n2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:15.840\n the US confiscated the Russian central bank's\n\n2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:17.640\n significant monetary reserves\n\n2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:20.600\n and banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT network.\n\n2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:22.400\n Serious questions are being asked\n\n2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:25.160\n about the survival of the postwar dollar\n\n2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:28.080\n based world monetary order.\n\n2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:30.080\n Will Russia, China and other countries\n\n2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:33.320\n actually build an alternative international settlement system\n\n2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:35.240\n after years of threatening to do so?\n\n2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:36.360\n Question mark.\n\n2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:38.760\n Will global central banks stop accumulating\n\n2:15:38.760 --> 2:15:40.800\n US treasury bonds and replace them\n\n2:15:40.800 --> 2:15:42.960\n with gold and commodities?\n\n2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:45.240\n Will we witness the birth of a new commodity\n\n2:15:45.240 --> 2:15:47.360\n gold based monetary order?\n\n2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:49.600\n In this seminar, we use the insights\n\n2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:52.200\n from the Bitcoin Standard and the Fiat Standard\n\n2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:54.840\n on temporal and spatial salability\n\n2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:57.640\n to explain why reports of the death of the dollar\n\n2:15:57.640 --> 2:16:00.840\n and the emergence of a new gold standard may be exaggerated.\n\n2:16:00.840 --> 2:16:04.720\n So I would love to get your analysis on this situation.\n\n2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:06.160\n What are the fundamentals of it?\n\n2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:07.280\n What is SWIFT?\n\n2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:09.080\n What are the possible future evolutions\n\n2:16:09.080 --> 2:16:11.280\n of the global monetary system?\n\n2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:12.480\n Yeah, so SWIFT is the network\n\n2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:14.680\n that the US Federal Reserve uses\n\n2:16:14.680 --> 2:16:17.880\n for moving money around the world.\n\n2:16:17.880 --> 2:16:20.080\n So basically the US government can sanction you\n\n2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:22.720\n off of SWIFT as they've done with Russian banks,\n\n2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.600\n as they've done with Iran,\n\n2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:27.200\n and as they've done with Afghanistan.\n\n2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:30.960\n So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe\n\n2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:32.080\n of the current monetary system\n\n2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:34.280\n is that in order to be able to trade\n\n2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:37.320\n as a member, as a citizen of your country,\n\n2:16:37.320 --> 2:16:40.360\n you need your monopoly local central bank\n\n2:16:40.360 --> 2:16:42.560\n to be on good terms with the US government\n\n2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:44.080\n so that they would let them operate.\n\n2:16:44.080 --> 2:16:48.320\n And this is really like on top of the aspect\n\n2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:49.480\n of the hardness of money,\n\n2:16:49.480 --> 2:16:52.880\n this is the other really powerful thing about Bitcoin,\n\n2:16:52.880 --> 2:16:54.920\n which is that it's just purely a technological thing.\n\n2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:57.560\n It doesn't matter if you're Russian, if you're Iranian,\n\n2:16:57.560 --> 2:17:00.200\n if you're American, if you're Chinese, it's a technology.\n\n2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:03.560\n And so it's like a spoon or a knife or a car,\n\n2:17:03.560 --> 2:17:06.120\n you operate it properly and it works.\n\n2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:07.520\n And so with Bitcoin, it's the same thing.\n\n2:17:07.520 --> 2:17:09.320\n It doesn't care about your passport.\n\n2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:11.760\n If you have the private key, you click send\n\n2:17:11.760 --> 2:17:14.680\n and the money goes, well, it doesn't really go,\n\n2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:18.040\n but effectively it does go anywhere at once\n\n2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:19.400\n and the money can move\n\n2:17:19.400 --> 2:17:22.440\n without having to abide by political situations.\n\n2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:26.040\n And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy\n\n2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:27.640\n much as that might be deserved.\n\n2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:28.560\n I'm just going to discuss it\n\n2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:31.080\n from a kind of technical perspective.\n\n2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.120\n It has to be a political system with fiat\n\n2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:35.240\n because ultimately it relies on credit.\n\n2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:37.480\n And then the government is the one that has the guns\n\n2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:38.760\n and the government is going to decide\n\n2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:40.480\n who gets to pay their loans anyway.\n\n2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:45.480\n And the government's going to have to make its own rules\n\n2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:47.880\n about who gets to play and who doesn't.\n\n2:17:47.880 --> 2:17:51.360\n And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system.\n\n2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:56.240\n And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard,\n\n2:17:56.240 --> 2:17:58.640\n initially I used to be much more of a gold bug.\n\n2:17:58.640 --> 2:18:02.600\n And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years\n\n2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:04.440\n saying the global monetary system\n\n2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:05.600\n is going to collapse next week\n\n2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:07.720\n and we're going to go back to a gold standard.\n\n2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:10.560\n And writing the fiat standard gave me\n\n2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:13.560\n a very good appreciation for why this hasn't happened\n\n2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:15.680\n and why it's not very likely to happen.\n\n2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:18.840\n I think the reason is, as I said earlier,\n\n2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:20.760\n just gold is very expensive to move around\n\n2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:22.440\n and perhaps more importantly,\n\n2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:24.160\n it's very expensive to verify.\n\n2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:25.440\n That's really the problem with it.\n\n2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:27.120\n It's very expensive to verify\n\n2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.480\n that the gold that you're receiving is original gold.\n\n2:18:29.480 --> 2:18:32.480\n So the only way to do this properly\n\n2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:35.880\n is to melt the gold bars down and recast them,\n\n2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:37.480\n which is pretty expensive.\n\n2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:40.360\n So we have this situation now where Russia,\n\n2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:42.680\n which is one of the biggest economies in the world\n\n2:18:42.680 --> 2:18:45.640\n has been kicked off to varying degrees\n\n2:18:45.640 --> 2:18:47.320\n off the global monetary system\n\n2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:49.240\n and the US has confiscated their reserves.\n\n2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:52.560\n And I don't have political opinions about the war.\n\n2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:54.360\n It's not something I'm very familiar with.\n\n2:18:54.360 --> 2:18:56.400\n It's outside of my area of expertise.\n\n2:18:56.400 --> 2:18:58.800\n I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it.\n\n2:18:58.800 --> 2:19:00.720\n It is, on the one hand,\n\n2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:02.960\n whether you think the war is justified\n\n2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.040\n or the sanctions are justified\n\n2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:08.040\n is not something I can opine on.\n\n2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:11.040\n But the implication of this is that effectively\n\n2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:13.000\n the US might be shooting itself in the foot\n\n2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:15.480\n because it's telling everybody in the world,\n\n2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:18.040\n your money in our system is not really your money.\n\n2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:22.120\n It's just a token to play in our arcade.\n\n2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:23.800\n And any point in time, if you misbehave,\n\n2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:27.680\n we kick you out of the arcade and we take your tokens.\n\n2:19:27.680 --> 2:19:32.120\n And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran\n\n2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:33.720\n and many countries have made a lot of noise about\n\n2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:35.080\n over the past decades.\n\n2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:38.280\n It got real this year,\n\n2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:43.280\n but it's been decades of China, Iran and Russia\n\n2:19:43.480 --> 2:19:44.800\n to some extent saying that, you know,\n\n2:19:44.800 --> 2:19:48.680\n we wanna build an alternative to the US dollar based system.\n\n2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:50.080\n And yet they haven't.\n\n2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.600\n And I think there's very good reasons they haven't.\n\n2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:54.040\n And the reason is, what do you do based on?\n\n2:19:54.040 --> 2:19:55.200\n How do you build it?\n\n2:19:55.200 --> 2:19:57.800\n So you can do a credit based system based on,\n\n2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:00.480\n but then who's gonna be the big boss?\n\n2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:01.400\n Is it gonna be China?\n\n2:20:01.400 --> 2:20:02.240\n Is it gonna be Russia?\n\n2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:03.080\n Is it gonna be Iran?\n\n2:20:03.080 --> 2:20:04.200\n Is it gonna be India?\n\n2:20:04.200 --> 2:20:06.840\n None of these countries wants to be, you know,\n\n2:20:06.840 --> 2:20:10.400\n they don't wanna jump out of the US based system\n\n2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:12.560\n to get into somebody else's based system.\n\n2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:14.440\n So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system.\n\n2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:16.520\n Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system.\n\n2:20:16.520 --> 2:20:17.840\n And so therefore you can't use\n\n2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:19.520\n their own central bank's currencies.\n\n2:20:19.520 --> 2:20:23.240\n Don't you think they have enough leverage,\n\n2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:27.800\n India, China, Russia combined with several other nations\n\n2:20:27.800 --> 2:20:29.920\n have enough leverage and incentive\n\n2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:32.040\n to create their own system?\n\n2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:35.600\n So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate.\n\n2:20:35.600 --> 2:20:37.280\n Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you based on?\n\n2:20:37.280 --> 2:20:39.620\n Like who's going to be the boss?\n\n2:20:39.620 --> 2:20:40.880\n Who's going to be the one who can?\n\n2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:42.500\n In this case, China, right?\n\n2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:45.880\n Because China's becoming increasingly\n\n2:20:45.880 --> 2:20:47.640\n an economic power in the world.\n\n2:20:47.640 --> 2:20:48.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:49.520\n That's hard to deny.\n\n2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:50.360\n Yes, it's true.\n\n2:20:50.360 --> 2:20:52.680\n And it's the most likely scenario perhaps\n\n2:20:52.680 --> 2:20:54.600\n if we were to witness something like this\n\n2:20:54.600 --> 2:20:57.200\n is going to be a Chinese based system.\n\n2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:00.520\n So is it possible to have like a split\n\n2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:04.680\n in what is the driving currency of the world?\n\n2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:06.840\n It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable.\n\n2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:08.160\n Again, money wants to be won.\n\n2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:10.560\n And that's the kind of thing that I argue in that seminar.\n\n2:21:10.560 --> 2:21:13.480\n So we could see this emerge based around the Yuan\n\n2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:18.200\n and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously going to hurt\n\n2:21:18.200 --> 2:21:19.600\n economically from what happened\n\n2:21:19.600 --> 2:21:22.160\n from the confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions.\n\n2:21:22.160 --> 2:21:24.600\n So it's not going to be in a position.\n\n2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:27.680\n And of course, because it's outside of the US based system,\n\n2:21:27.680 --> 2:21:29.760\n it's not in the strongest negotiating position\n\n2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:30.600\n with the Chinese.\n\n2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:32.720\n So the Chinese might be able to get them\n\n2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:34.960\n to join their Yuan based system.\n\n2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.920\n But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run\n\n2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:41.120\n because these governments can issue their laws\n\n2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:45.080\n and make their designs and then make their monetary systems.\n\n2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:50.080\n But ultimately, there are billions of Chinese people\n\n2:21:50.280 --> 2:21:52.040\n and billions of dollar based people\n\n2:21:52.040 --> 2:21:53.680\n and they're going to want to trade with one another.\n\n2:21:53.680 --> 2:21:55.560\n And the power to want to trade with one another\n\n2:21:55.560 --> 2:21:56.400\n is too strong.\n\n2:21:56.400 --> 2:21:58.200\n We can't just split the world economy\n\n2:21:58.200 --> 2:22:00.720\n into two monetary systems that don't trade with one another.\n\n2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:02.920\n So then they're going to want to trade with one another.\n\n2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:07.920\n Or the dark possibility is the inability to trade\n\n2:22:10.840 --> 2:22:14.400\n as opposed to being a forcing function for trade.\n\n2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:17.720\n It will become a forcing function for conflict\n\n2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:20.280\n in cyberspace and potentially hot war.\n\n2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:22.560\n Yes, this is the scary part of it.\n\n2:22:22.560 --> 2:22:24.800\n And this is basically how World War II happened\n\n2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:28.280\n because there's an old historian who used to say\n\n2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:30.400\n when I think his name is Otto Mallory\n\n2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:31.960\n and I quote him in the Bitcoin standard,\n\n2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:35.600\n if goods don't cross borders, then bombs will.\n\n2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:36.760\n If people trade with one another,\n\n2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:39.280\n they have an incentive for each other's wellbeing\n\n2:22:39.280 --> 2:22:42.520\n and then they have less of an incentive to fight.\n\n2:22:42.520 --> 2:22:45.520\n And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s\n\n2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:48.680\n because of the failure of the fiat system\n\n2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:52.040\n that brought about the rise of the populism\n\n2:22:52.040 --> 2:22:54.120\n and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other\n\n2:22:54.120 --> 2:22:56.240\n and helped finance the war and bring it about.\n\n2:22:56.240 --> 2:22:58.120\n So that is the scary possibility.\n\n2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:00.920\n And of course, you can't discount that\n\n2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:02.560\n with all of the escalation that you see,\n\n2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:05.520\n that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war.\n\n2:23:05.520 --> 2:23:09.120\n But then even so, I think ultimately,\n\n2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:10.680\n you can't fight wars forever.\n\n2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:13.880\n It's going to end at some point.\n\n2:23:13.880 --> 2:23:15.640\n And we're going to be back at square one\n\n2:23:15.640 --> 2:23:16.920\n or well, not square one.\n\n2:23:16.920 --> 2:23:18.240\n We're going to be back at the same dilemma\n\n2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:21.800\n of who's going to have the global monetary system.\n\n2:23:21.800 --> 2:23:24.560\n And so one alternative is that what the Chinese\n\n2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:27.040\n and the Russians could do is they could base it\n\n2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:28.240\n on a commodity.\n\n2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:29.320\n So a lot of people are now saying,\n\n2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:32.640\n well, they're going to base it on copper and corn\n\n2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:35.480\n and agricultural commodities.\n\n2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:38.160\n And that's the analysis of saleability\n\n2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:39.680\n that we discuss in the Bitcoin standard\n\n2:23:39.680 --> 2:23:40.880\n and the fiat standard.\n\n2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:42.200\n I don't think that's workable.\n\n2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:44.760\n If you end up basing the monetary system on copper,\n\n2:23:44.760 --> 2:23:47.240\n as we said earlier, it doesn't matter how many governments\n\n2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:50.120\n say that we're going to make a new monetary system\n\n2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:55.120\n based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on.\n\n2:23:56.440 --> 2:23:57.280\n It doesn't matter.\n\n2:23:57.280 --> 2:24:00.000\n You're going to have to stockpile those things\n\n2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.400\n in order to make a market in them.\n\n2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:03.720\n And then if you stockpile those things,\n\n2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:05.440\n you're just raising their value,\n\n2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:08.800\n inviting the producers to make more, flood the market.\n\n2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:10.600\n I hope they don't try this because it's going to be\n\n2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:15.240\n a devastating, devastating impact on the world economy.\n\n2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:17.960\n You're going to have central banks bidding up the price\n\n2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:20.800\n of essential commodities that people need for real uses\n\n2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:23.000\n in order to back their currencies with them,\n\n2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:24.800\n and then just incentivizing the producers\n\n2:24:24.800 --> 2:24:26.600\n to make more and more and more of it,\n\n2:24:26.600 --> 2:24:28.040\n and then bringing the price back down.\n\n2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:29.840\n So it's going to be a very expensive mistake\n\n2:24:29.840 --> 2:24:31.640\n where we raise the price of copper,\n\n2:24:31.640 --> 2:24:33.840\n destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper,\n\n2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:35.600\n and it's not just copper, but also food,\n\n2:24:35.600 --> 2:24:38.240\n and then increase the supply beyond what we need.\n\n2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:41.680\n And the end result is copper miners make out well,\n\n2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:43.720\n governments go broke,\n\n2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:46.240\n and we end up with a lot of rust in copper\n\n2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:49.520\n in government warehouses.\n\n2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:54.120\n That's why I don't think it works to use commodities\n\n2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:56.360\n that are not monetary commodities.\n\n2:24:56.360 --> 2:24:58.520\n Then the question is maybe gold.\n\n2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:00.800\n Can we go back on another gold standard?\n\n2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:04.520\n And I mean, Russia seems to have done that.\n\n2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:05.600\n I'm not so sure.\n\n2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:07.640\n It's very difficult to get reliable information.\n\n2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:09.320\n I'm trying to look into this more,\n\n2:25:10.280 --> 2:25:13.160\n but they seem to have said that they're fixing\n\n2:25:13.160 --> 2:25:15.200\n the price of gold in rubles.\n\n2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:18.640\n So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate,\n\n2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:20.920\n which effectively means you're on a gold standard.\n\n2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:24.640\n Now, I'm not sure how much, how serious this is,\n\n2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:26.440\n how they've managed to stick to it,\n\n2:25:26.440 --> 2:25:28.840\n but it seems to have stabilized the ruble\n\n2:25:28.840 --> 2:25:31.000\n and in fact brought it back to its pre war level,\n\n2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.320\n which I found absolutely astonishing,\n\n2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:35.920\n considering all the sanctions going on.\n\n2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:39.720\n But in the short run, it's obviously much better\n\n2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:41.720\n than having your currency pegged to nothing.\n\n2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:43.200\n But in the long run,\n\n2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:45.520\n I also don't think gold is gonna cut it\n\n2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:46.720\n in the 21st century.\n\n2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:50.600\n Do you think there's any chance they go full gangster move\n\n2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:54.720\n and go into the digital space on the blockchain\n\n2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:55.800\n and go with Bitcoin?\n\n2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:59.640\n I think the point of this discussion is that,\n\n2:25:59.640 --> 2:26:01.760\n we run through all these other options,\n\n2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:04.600\n a Chinese based system, why it probably won't work,\n\n2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:06.400\n a commodity based system, why it won't work,\n\n2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:08.720\n and a gold based system, why it won't work.\n\n2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:12.040\n I think they might have to learn this the wrong way.\n\n2:26:12.040 --> 2:26:13.560\n I mean, the hard way.\n\n2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:16.000\n But eventually, I don't see them doing it now,\n\n2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.720\n but eventually I think the winning move\n\n2:26:18.720 --> 2:26:21.480\n is going to be to go on a Bitcoin based monetary system.\n\n2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:23.880\n Well, I don't know if everything always has to be\n\n2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:25.720\n the hard way.\n\n2:26:25.720 --> 2:26:27.600\n I'd love it not to be, but I mean,\n\n2:26:28.640 --> 2:26:31.960\n it doesn't look like there is any kind of desire\n\n2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:34.720\n in China or in Russia to switch to a Bitcoin based system.\n\n2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:36.120\n To take a leap to Bitcoin.\n\n2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.680\n So unfortunately, I think we're gonna go through\n\n2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:44.200\n a few years, maybe many years of learning the lesson\n\n2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:46.800\n the hard way, of trying to accumulate these commodities\n\n2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:49.200\n and seeing the limitations that make them unsuitable\n\n2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:50.440\n as money today.\n\n2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:52.280\n One of the things I'm really concerned about\n\n2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:53.880\n is the tension, the amount,\n\n2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:58.000\n the increasing amount of hate in the world.\n\n2:26:58.000 --> 2:26:58.880\n Yes.\n\n2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:03.480\n And the increasing amount of power centers in the world\n\n2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:08.480\n between which hate is making a regular appearance.\n\n2:27:12.040 --> 2:27:14.440\n And because the weapons of war are becoming\n\n2:27:14.440 --> 2:27:16.000\n more and more powerful as they have been\n\n2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:19.640\n in the past many decades,\n\n2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:22.280\n I'm really concerned about nuclear war.\n\n2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:25.160\n So let us see if Bitcoin can fix this.\n\n2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:27.280\n Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this.\n\n2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:31.040\n The first rule of Bitcoin is if it's a problem,\n\n2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:32.040\n Bitcoin fixes it.\n\n2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.080\n All right, well I have some personal questions\n\n2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:37.120\n for Bitcoin then, because I have some,\n\n2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:40.040\n my life is pretty fucked up, so I'll have to try to see.\n\n2:27:40.040 --> 2:27:41.680\n A quick pause for bathroom breaking, any?\n\n2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:43.120\n Sure.\n\n2:27:43.120 --> 2:27:44.800\n Let's return to the basics.\n\n2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:46.400\n What is Bitcoin?\n\n2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:49.320\n We started with what is money, what is Bitcoin?\n\n2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:52.400\n We talked about hard money, inflation,\n\n2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:56.800\n fiat, the history of money, the history of war\n\n2:27:56.800 --> 2:27:58.640\n in the 20th century, and that takes us\n\n2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:00.320\n into the 21st century.\n\n2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:02.120\n What is Bitcoin?\n\n2:28:02.120 --> 2:28:05.800\n Bitcoin is a software, and it's a distributed software\n\n2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:09.080\n to operate peer to peer network between members\n\n2:28:09.080 --> 2:28:11.800\n who are all equal on the network, they're all peers.\n\n2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:14.520\n And what this software does is that it allows you\n\n2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:19.400\n to operate a payment network between those peers,\n\n2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:22.360\n and that payment network has its own currency.\n\n2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:26.320\n And that seems like just a simple software game,\n\n2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:28.680\n but the reason this is such a big deal is,\n\n2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:30.760\n I believe Bitcoin is the most advanced form\n\n2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:32.440\n of money ever invented.\n\n2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:34.880\n And the reason for that comes from two properties\n\n2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:36.840\n that this network has.\n\n2:28:36.840 --> 2:28:39.320\n The first one is that the currency\n\n2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.720\n is the hardest money ever invented.\n\n2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:44.800\n It's the money whose supply is the most resistant\n\n2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:45.960\n to inflation.\n\n2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:49.040\n It's the first monetary asset that we've ever invented\n\n2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:52.120\n that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply,\n\n2:28:52.120 --> 2:28:54.600\n that cannot be increased beyond a certain number.\n\n2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:56.960\n So there's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins.\n\n2:28:56.960 --> 2:29:00.600\n And that's a qualitative leap forward\n\n2:29:00.600 --> 2:29:02.640\n in our technologies of money.\n\n2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:05.560\n All of our monies leak, essentially,\n\n2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:08.400\n because people can always make more and more and more of them.\n\n2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:11.040\n You know, the best money is the one that leaks the least,\n\n2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:13.800\n which is gold, because it only leaks one and a half percent.\n\n2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:17.840\n In other words, your share of the gold stock\n\n2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:21.200\n is diluted by one and a half percent every year.\n\n2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:23.240\n Ideally, you'd like it to be zero.\n\n2:29:23.240 --> 2:29:27.480\n Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8% headed towards zero.\n\n2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:29.200\n So it's the first money that we've ever had\n\n2:29:29.200 --> 2:29:31.960\n that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply.\n\n2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:34.640\n So there'll never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.\n\n2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:36.880\n I think that's a huge deal because, you know,\n\n2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:39.560\n as I said earlier, money is always whatever\n\n2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:40.480\n is the hardest to make,\n\n2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:43.240\n and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make.\n\n2:29:43.240 --> 2:29:44.520\n And then the second property,\n\n2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:46.800\n which is extremely important as well,\n\n2:29:46.800 --> 2:29:50.200\n is the fact that it operates without the need\n\n2:29:50.200 --> 2:29:51.560\n to trust in anybody.\n\n2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:54.040\n It doesn't have a party that is in charge of it.\n\n2:29:54.040 --> 2:29:57.080\n It doesn't have a central authority that can,\n\n2:29:57.080 --> 2:29:58.720\n you know, as I said, it's peer to peer.\n\n2:29:58.720 --> 2:30:00.560\n So it only has users.\n\n2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:02.440\n It doesn't have any admins.\n\n2:30:02.440 --> 2:30:04.720\n There's no authority in charge of Bitcoin\n\n2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:05.840\n that can take your Bitcoin,\n\n2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:08.200\n that can stop you from using Bitcoin,\n\n2:30:08.200 --> 2:30:09.600\n that can change the rules of Bitcoin.\n\n2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:11.080\n They can't make more of it.\n\n2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:12.800\n So it's fixed.\n\n2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:15.160\n It's available for anybody in the world.\n\n2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:17.200\n It's the hardest money ever invented.\n\n2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:21.920\n And it is absolutely, I think, an enormously,\n\n2:30:21.920 --> 2:30:23.520\n enormously significant invention\n\n2:30:23.520 --> 2:30:26.440\n because if you read the fiat standard\n\n2:30:26.440 --> 2:30:28.600\n and the Bitcoin standard as well,\n\n2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:31.200\n you'll see my perspective for why I think\n\n2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:34.520\n a very large number of problems in the world\n\n2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:37.320\n are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation,\n\n2:30:38.320 --> 2:30:41.840\n and caused by government having access to essentially\n\n2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:45.880\n an infinite recourse to people's wealth.\n\n2:30:45.880 --> 2:30:47.840\n And I think Bitcoin fixes this\n\n2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:51.440\n because it allows us to have money\n\n2:30:51.440 --> 2:30:54.440\n that has the salability of gold across time,\n\n2:30:54.440 --> 2:30:57.280\n meaning it holds its value across time like gold,\n\n2:30:57.280 --> 2:30:58.720\n but much better than gold.\n\n2:30:58.720 --> 2:31:01.800\n But also it is similar to fiat\n\n2:31:01.800 --> 2:31:03.840\n in that fiat can travel quickly,\n\n2:31:03.840 --> 2:31:06.080\n but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat.\n\n2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:11.080\n So it combines gold's salability across time\n\n2:31:11.400 --> 2:31:14.000\n with fiat's salability across space\n\n2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:17.200\n in one immutable package that nobody can change\n\n2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:18.280\n and nobody can control.\n\n2:31:18.280 --> 2:31:20.120\n Can you define the word salability?\n\n2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:22.960\n Salability is the essential property of money.\n\n2:31:22.960 --> 2:31:27.960\n It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,\n\n2:31:28.520 --> 2:31:31.200\n specifically to be sold without much loss in its value.\n\n2:31:31.200 --> 2:31:33.560\n So houses are great for living in,\n\n2:31:33.560 --> 2:31:35.040\n but they're not very salable.\n\n2:31:35.040 --> 2:31:36.680\n If you wanna sell a house,\n\n2:31:36.680 --> 2:31:38.600\n you can just click a button and sell a house\n\n2:31:38.600 --> 2:31:41.880\n and have a giant market of people buying houses from you.\n\n2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:45.000\n You need to find somebody\n\n2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:46.720\n who wants the exact house that you have\n\n2:31:46.720 --> 2:31:48.800\n with the exact specifications that you have.\n\n2:31:48.800 --> 2:31:50.480\n And because houses are not identical,\n\n2:31:50.480 --> 2:31:52.160\n there's no liquid giant market\n\n2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:55.360\n for people to just buy and sell identical houses from.\n\n2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:01.400\n So gold, for instance, has good salability as money\n\n2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:03.880\n because it's a liquid good, it's uniform,\n\n2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:06.040\n and people are always buying it.\n\n2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:08.200\n Fiat dollars have great salability\n\n2:32:08.200 --> 2:32:09.880\n because everybody's always buying\n\n2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:11.960\n and exchanging dollars for other goods.\n\n2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:15.320\n So if you have $100 bill, you can easily get rid of it\n\n2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:18.000\n and you'll get $100 worth of stuff for it.\n\n2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.880\n If you have $100 worth of stuff,\n\n2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:22.000\n it's harder to get rid of it.\n\n2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:24.600\n If you have $100 worth of phone,\n\n2:32:24.600 --> 2:32:26.960\n it's not as easy to spend it as a $100 bill.\n\n2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:28.400\n That's salability.\n\n2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:31.000\n What do you mean that Bitcoin,\n\n2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.280\n I understand that Bitcoin has the salability\n\n2:32:33.280 --> 2:32:35.280\n of gold across time.\n\n2:32:35.280 --> 2:32:36.360\n Better even, yeah.\n\n2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:39.360\n Better, yes, like on the order or whatever.\n\n2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:42.880\n And then it has the salability of fiat across space.\n\n2:32:42.880 --> 2:32:43.800\n What does that mean?\n\n2:32:43.800 --> 2:32:44.760\n So if you remember when you asked me\n\n2:32:44.760 --> 2:32:46.200\n what is the advantage of fiat,\n\n2:32:46.200 --> 2:32:48.160\n what is the advantage it offers us,\n\n2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:50.880\n it's cheaper to move fiat across space\n\n2:32:50.880 --> 2:32:52.400\n than it is to move gold.\n\n2:32:52.400 --> 2:32:54.800\n With the current fiat monetary system,\n\n2:32:54.800 --> 2:32:58.360\n for all of its flaws, you can send money,\n\n2:32:58.360 --> 2:33:01.240\n I could send money from my bank account in the US\n\n2:33:01.240 --> 2:33:05.280\n to a bank account in China in a couple of days,\n\n2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:08.920\n or in Britain, in France, in a day or two,\n\n2:33:08.920 --> 2:33:10.960\n which is much faster than you could do with gold\n\n2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:13.440\n and much cheaper than you could do with gold.\n\n2:33:13.440 --> 2:33:16.400\n But in reality, with fiat,\n\n2:33:16.400 --> 2:33:17.800\n the reason Bitcoin improves on that\n\n2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:19.560\n is that with Bitcoin, you're actually selling,\n\n2:33:19.560 --> 2:33:23.000\n you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours.\n\n2:33:23.000 --> 2:33:24.360\n So you send the Bitcoin transaction,\n\n2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:26.480\n you get six confirmations in an hour,\n\n2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:29.800\n you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average.\n\n2:33:29.800 --> 2:33:34.320\n With 12 confirmations, you're pretty definitely\n\n2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:36.560\n clearly safe on this.\n\n2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:38.360\n So within a couple of hours,\n\n2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:41.080\n you could send a billion dollars across the ocean\n\n2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:44.040\n and have final settlement on them.\n\n2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:46.600\n It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation\n\n2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:49.080\n that's gonna need weeks and months to settle,\n\n2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:51.040\n which is the case with fiat.\n\n2:33:51.040 --> 2:33:54.040\n So it is faster than fiat, effectively.\n\n2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:56.960\n So it's harder than gold and faster than fiat.\n\n2:33:56.960 --> 2:33:58.560\n That's a good way of putting it.\n\n2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:04.040\n One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask,\n\n2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:06.680\n to me on a human level, it's fascinating,\n\n2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:09.760\n is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto,\n\n2:34:09.760 --> 2:34:12.000\n an anonymous founder, there's no leader.\n\n2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:14.960\n So that's another aspect of the decentralization\n\n2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.280\n is leaderless.\n\n2:34:16.280 --> 2:34:17.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:19.560\n So unfortunately, it's not a monarchy.\n\n2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:20.400\n Fortunately.\n\n2:34:20.400 --> 2:34:22.160\n Or fortunately, yes.\n\n2:34:22.160 --> 2:34:24.560\n Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, do you think?\n\n2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:26.680\n And first of all, is it you?\n\n2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:28.200\n It definitely is not me.\n\n2:34:29.400 --> 2:34:30.440\n I don't know who it is.\n\n2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:32.040\n If it was, would you tell me?\n\n2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:34.360\n That's a trick question.\n\n2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:35.560\n Yeah, I know, trick question.\n\n2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:37.040\n But I mean, everybody who knows me knows\n\n2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:38.040\n I can't read the code.\n\n2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:41.120\n So you would say that even if you could.\n\n2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:43.320\n But that's true.\n\n2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:44.440\n Do you think it's one person?\n\n2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:45.640\n Do you think it's multiple people?\n\n2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:47.000\n Is it interesting to you?\n\n2:34:47.000 --> 2:34:49.520\n Do you think it's fundamental to the coin itself\n\n2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:53.200\n to not to coin the entirety of the concept\n\n2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:56.240\n that it's founders and animus?\n\n2:34:56.240 --> 2:34:58.640\n And how much guts do you think it takes\n\n2:34:58.640 --> 2:35:02.320\n if it's one person to just walk away from so much money?\n\n2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:04.720\n I've considered all these questions many times.\n\n2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:07.720\n It's very hard to formulate a definitive answer\n\n2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:09.160\n to all of them.\n\n2:35:09.160 --> 2:35:10.120\n I don't know who it is.\n\n2:35:10.120 --> 2:35:15.120\n And I don't know why he or them or she\n\n2:35:15.640 --> 2:35:19.960\n are not spending the coins that they most likely have.\n\n2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:23.040\n I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi\n\n2:35:23.040 --> 2:35:24.920\n is the fact that he's not there.\n\n2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:28.040\n And this is what's truly astonishing about it.\n\n2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:29.720\n The most important fact in Bitcoin\n\n2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:31.800\n is the fact that the creators disappeared\n\n2:35:31.800 --> 2:35:33.440\n and the thing has continued to operate now\n\n2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:35.560\n for almost 12 years without him being there\n\n2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:38.880\n or 11 years I think it's been since he's left.\n\n2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:41.120\n And this is really the most important thing.\n\n2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:44.520\n And maybe he died or she died\n\n2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:49.440\n or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever\n\n2:35:49.440 --> 2:35:51.240\n and that's why they haven't accessed their coins.\n\n2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:54.040\n Maybe they're incapacitated for some reason.\n\n2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:55.960\n But whatever reason it is,\n\n2:35:55.960 --> 2:36:00.560\n I really think it's fate or serendipity\n\n2:36:00.560 --> 2:36:04.520\n that has given us this very vital,\n\n2:36:04.520 --> 2:36:07.960\n very, very, very vital building ingredient in Bitcoin\n\n2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:11.120\n which no other digital currency would ever recreate,\n\n2:36:11.120 --> 2:36:14.760\n which is that because it was the first,\n\n2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:17.360\n it was the one that was able to establish\n\n2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:19.520\n the first mover advantage and get all of the people\n\n2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:22.160\n who are interested in the technology to get into it.\n\n2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:23.760\n And so that's an enormous advantage,\n\n2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:28.760\n but the cherry on top or what made the whole thing\n\n2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:31.800\n really function well is the fact\n\n2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:33.760\n that the guy who made it disappeared\n\n2:36:33.760 --> 2:36:35.280\n and that it continued to operate,\n\n2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:37.440\n which is just a clear illustration\n\n2:36:37.440 --> 2:36:39.760\n that this is a network with no admins.\n\n2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:42.400\n And I'm tempted to think that they're incapacitated\n\n2:36:42.400 --> 2:36:44.160\n in some way, probably dead or gone\n\n2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:48.200\n because I can't believe the,\n\n2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:50.040\n I don't believe any human being\n\n2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:52.240\n would have this level of self control\n\n2:36:52.240 --> 2:36:55.520\n to not get into, not want to meddle\n\n2:36:55.520 --> 2:37:00.520\n with their invention so much, even if they,\n\n2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:01.920\n they might have had the self control\n\n2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:03.480\n to like mine the first million coins\n\n2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:05.880\n to get the network going and then throw away the coins\n\n2:37:05.880 --> 2:37:07.040\n or send them to an address\n\n2:37:07.040 --> 2:37:08.640\n that they don't have the key to\n\n2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:12.160\n because they really just wanted the network to take off.\n\n2:37:12.160 --> 2:37:14.200\n They may have no access to the coins\n\n2:37:14.200 --> 2:37:15.480\n and that's why they can't move them.\n\n2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:17.000\n I could see that happening,\n\n2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:18.240\n but I find it harder to believe\n\n2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:20.320\n that they would resist the temptation\n\n2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:21.880\n to mess with the network.\n\n2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:25.320\n You know, it's funny, I find that the founders of ideas\n\n2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:29.600\n are often principled and have the integrity\n\n2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:34.600\n that the eventual users of those ideas don't fully have.\n\n2:37:35.600 --> 2:37:38.480\n I tend to, you know, we have the kind of cynical view,\n\n2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:41.320\n power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\n2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:42.720\n And we tend to, in our mind,\n\n2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:45.640\n generalize that all humans are corruptible.\n\n2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:47.680\n And perhaps that's true to some degree,\n\n2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:51.240\n but I think some people are more corruptible than others.\n\n2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:53.480\n And I find that there is, I mean,\n\n2:37:53.480 --> 2:37:58.000\n I like to think that Satoshi Nakamoto's out there\n\n2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:00.720\n and, you know, just like George Washington\n\n2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:03.320\n chose to walk away and it's a principle.\n\n2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:05.160\n And the principle is more powerful\n\n2:38:05.160 --> 2:38:09.080\n than the financial reward or any of those kinds of things.\n\n2:38:10.160 --> 2:38:12.360\n It's a principle that stands for freedom.\n\n2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:14.000\n And there's a lot of people throughout history,\n\n2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:14.920\n even recent history,\n\n2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:18.120\n that are willing to die for these principles\n\n2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:23.120\n or live a life full of suffering and sacrifice\n\n2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.000\n because they're still living a life of principle\n\n2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.160\n and choosing that day after day after day.\n\n2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:31.400\n So, I mean, there's power to that.\n\n2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:34.000\n Money, what's the worth of money in the end?\n\n2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:37.940\n In terms of just personal financial gain\n\n2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:42.940\n versus knowing how much positive impact there is.\n\n2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.240\n So the person that chooses to walk away like that,\n\n2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:47.560\n I think is the same kind of person\n\n2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:52.560\n that chooses to live by that principle.\n\n2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:53.960\n You have people like that, you know,\n\n2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:58.280\n in Grigori Grisha Perlman in mathematics\n\n2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:01.760\n who turned down the Fields Medal because he was.\n\n2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:05.640\n Yeah, that's a medal, not $50 billion of Bitcoin.\n\n2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:06.820\n Well, that's, I.\n\n2:39:06.820 --> 2:39:08.240\n No, I know, I know, I'm joking.\n\n2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:10.920\n Well, that's actually an interesting, just a brief comment.\n\n2:39:10.920 --> 2:39:12.640\n You know, when people talk about Bitcoin\n\n2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:14.440\n in the cryptocurrency space,\n\n2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:19.440\n that it's often mixed up financial interest and ideas.\n\n2:39:19.440 --> 2:39:24.360\n And I think those are often correlated,\n\n2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:27.600\n but that good feeling you get when you win\n\n2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.680\n or number go up or you just,\n\n2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:32.860\n just somebody, you know,\n\n2:39:32.860 --> 2:39:35.760\n I found 20 bucks on the street the other day.\n\n2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:38.120\n And just that feeling of just like,\n\n2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:41.380\n ooh, like more money, that positive feeling,\n\n2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:44.360\n that's correlated, but it is distinct\n\n2:39:44.360 --> 2:39:47.480\n from the power of the idea to change a world,\n\n2:39:47.480 --> 2:39:49.120\n to change the world for the better.\n\n2:39:49.120 --> 2:39:51.560\n For the, to alleviate, it's like Alex Gladstein,\n\n2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:53.000\n in the case of Bitcoin,\n\n2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.200\n that decreased the amount of suffering in the world\n\n2:39:55.200 --> 2:39:56.760\n because of the authoritarian regimes.\n\n2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:00.320\n And just because your number goes up\n\n2:40:00.320 --> 2:40:04.200\n like that gambling feeling of like, yes, yes, this is good.\n\n2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:07.160\n And I mean, short term number go up.\n\n2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:08.520\n There's a long term number go up\n\n2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:10.800\n that's more like investment and so on.\n\n2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:12.120\n And there's a short term number go up\n\n2:40:12.120 --> 2:40:14.520\n that's just a good feeling that you can't,\n\n2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:16.720\n you have to, in your mind, keep those distinct\n\n2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:21.320\n from the power of the idea to transform the world.\n\n2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:24.200\n And if you focus on the power of the idea,\n\n2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:28.840\n maybe a billion or billions of dollars don't matter as much.\n\n2:40:28.840 --> 2:40:30.400\n At least that's what I would like to believe.\n\n2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:32.640\n Perhaps, but what matters ultimately\n\n2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:34.280\n is that the thing works without him.\n\n2:40:34.280 --> 2:40:35.880\n The thing's worked for 11 years without him.\n\n2:40:35.880 --> 2:40:38.720\n And I think this is the really important thing.\n\n2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:41.680\n If they had stuck around for whatever reason\n\n2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:43.800\n and they had continued to meddle with it,\n\n2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:46.360\n it's not clear to me how decentralized\n\n2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:47.760\n it could have been.\n\n2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:49.320\n This is the problem with the other currencies.\n\n2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:52.560\n It's like, how do you lose control\n\n2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:54.680\n of the Frankenstein that you've created?\n\n2:40:54.680 --> 2:40:57.160\n The only way that this Frankenstein continues to survive\n\n2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:00.240\n is if the person in charge of it continues to feed it.\n\n2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:02.640\n And so it continues to be yours.\n\n2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:03.560\n And that's the problem\n\n2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:05.200\n with all the other digital currencies.\n\n2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:07.320\n If you've heard about any of the other 16,000\n\n2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:09.120\n digital currencies out there,\n\n2:41:09.120 --> 2:41:10.040\n you've only heard about it\n\n2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:11.920\n because there's a small group of people behind it\n\n2:41:11.920 --> 2:41:14.440\n that are working on it, that are promoting it.\n\n2:41:14.440 --> 2:41:17.080\n And that's why, and I think Michael Saylor's discussion\n\n2:41:17.080 --> 2:41:19.560\n with you was a magnificent illustration\n\n2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:23.000\n of the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins\n\n2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.800\n in that they are securities.\n\n2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:27.240\n And I think he makes a very compelling, brilliant case\n\n2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:31.920\n for why this makes them categorically different\n\n2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:32.760\n from Bitcoin.\n\n2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:34.680\n Bitcoin, you're buying property.\n\n2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:36.840\n I think he mentioned he's a huge fan of Dogecoin,\n\n2:41:36.840 --> 2:41:38.120\n but I might be misremembering.\n\n2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:39.200\n You are misremembering.\n\n2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:40.520\n Okay, me too.\n\n2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:42.840\n Maybe I'm quoting him out of context.\n\n2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:47.800\n Okay, let me just ask you about some possible criticisms\n\n2:41:47.800 --> 2:41:49.080\n of Bitcoin.\n\n2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:52.480\n So on centralization, so there's a criticism\n\n2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:55.960\n on the mining and on the node side,\n\n2:41:55.960 --> 2:41:58.000\n or the node is not really the criticism,\n\n2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:00.920\n but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized\n\n2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:04.600\n because a small number of miners control a majority\n\n2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:06.160\n of the hashing power.\n\n2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:08.360\n I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000,\n\n2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:11.880\n whatever the number is of computers that are full nodes,\n\n2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:15.640\n that have the full, that are actively connected\n\n2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:16.640\n to the network.\n\n2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.320\n So you could argue that's decentralized\n\n2:42:18.320 --> 2:42:20.440\n because it's global, it's all across the world,\n\n2:42:20.440 --> 2:42:25.440\n but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized.\n\n2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:27.360\n So if you're thinking of making a case\n\n2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:30.200\n for Bitcoin being decentralized,\n\n2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:34.400\n do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized?\n\n2:42:34.400 --> 2:42:37.400\n Is the nodes the important thing to think about?\n\n2:42:37.400 --> 2:42:38.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:40.800\n And what number of nodes counts as centralized\n\n2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:42.280\n and not?\n\n2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:43.960\n The nodes are what matters because the nodes\n\n2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:46.720\n are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters.\n\n2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:51.720\n I think the best way to think about it is that miners\n\n2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:54.720\n simply sell a commodity to the nodes\n\n2:42:54.720 --> 2:42:56.920\n and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks.\n\n2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:00.360\n So what a miner does is they solve the proof of work problem\n\n2:43:00.360 --> 2:43:02.280\n so they keep operating their computers\n\n2:43:02.280 --> 2:43:04.880\n until they can get a solution to the problem.\n\n2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:07.000\n And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions\n\n2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:10.160\n and present it to the nodes for the nodes to ratify\n\n2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:11.480\n and approve it.\n\n2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:14.280\n So therefore, this is, and this is,\n\n2:43:14.280 --> 2:43:18.520\n I strongly recommend people learn about the 2017 block size\n\n2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:21.680\n war to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin.\n\n2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:25.080\n I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin standard,\n\n2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:27.760\n but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail\n\n2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:30.640\n called The Block Size War by Jonathan Beer.\n\n2:43:30.640 --> 2:43:33.800\n It's a great description of, in 2017,\n\n2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:36.200\n essentially the miners thought that they can control Bitcoin.\n\n2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:39.640\n You know, they had, there was one mining company\n\n2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:42.360\n that produced the majority of the machines\n\n2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:44.720\n that were on the network and they,\n\n2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:48.320\n and their allies had control of the machines\n\n2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:51.280\n that were out there and they controlled the majority\n\n2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:53.000\n of the hash rate and they thought that they could change\n\n2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.880\n Bitcoin's supply, not supply, sorry,\n\n2:43:55.880 --> 2:43:57.760\n they could change Bitcoin's block size,\n\n2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:01.960\n which is a tiny little detail, technical parameters,\n\n2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:05.400\n not even all that big of a deal for the economics of it.\n\n2:44:05.400 --> 2:44:08.280\n But they thought that they could pass this change,\n\n2:44:08.280 --> 2:44:10.560\n they could force this change on the network.\n\n2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:13.760\n And the members of the network rejected it\n\n2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:15.160\n and they weren't able to do it.\n\n2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:17.560\n So the nodes are what is sovereign.\n\n2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:20.360\n The nodes are what determine the rules of the game.\n\n2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:23.520\n The miners are a service provider.\n\n2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:25.920\n The miners invest capital upfront.\n\n2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:28.960\n You know, they buy the machines, they buy the electricity,\n\n2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:31.560\n they buy the storage, they buy the locations,\n\n2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:34.720\n they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money\n\n2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:38.360\n based on the idea that if they behave according\n\n2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:39.840\n to what the nodes want,\n\n2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:42.160\n the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin.\n\n2:44:42.160 --> 2:44:43.600\n So the miners are in no position\n\n2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:45.040\n to dictate terms for anyone.\n\n2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:47.800\n You know, they've put up their capital upfront\n\n2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:51.640\n and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want.\n\n2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:53.320\n So therefore what really matters\n\n2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:54.880\n is the decentralization of the nodes.\n\n2:44:54.880 --> 2:44:57.920\n So we wanna, you wanna have as many nodes as possible.\n\n2:44:57.920 --> 2:44:59.840\n You should, you wanna have a system\n\n2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:01.920\n where there's a large number of nodes.\n\n2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:04.360\n And this is of course the biggest problem\n\n2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:08.720\n with other digital currencies is that, you know,\n\n2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:11.200\n because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market\n\n2:45:11.200 --> 2:45:13.040\n on a digital currency,\n\n2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:15.320\n the only way that you can really get traction\n\n2:45:16.240 --> 2:45:18.120\n is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords\n\n2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:20.480\n about, you know, we're doing this and we're doing that.\n\n2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:23.760\n And so other digital currencies are optimized\n\n2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:27.920\n for bells and whistles and buzzwords.\n\n2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:30.760\n And that means adding computational load,\n\n2:45:30.760 --> 2:45:33.640\n which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate,\n\n2:45:33.640 --> 2:45:35.680\n and therefore you have a very small number of nodes.\n\n2:45:35.680 --> 2:45:39.840\n In fact, very few digital currencies are keen\n\n2:45:39.840 --> 2:45:42.040\n to publicize how many nodes there are,\n\n2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:44.360\n and they don't have full nodes in the true sense.\n\n2:45:44.360 --> 2:45:46.560\n And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have\n\n2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:51.560\n because de facto, you know, you can spin up a million nodes\n\n2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:57.120\n tomorrow on AWS, doesn't really matter.\n\n2:45:57.120 --> 2:46:00.280\n What matters is de facto do the nodes dictate\n\n2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:02.240\n the rules of consensus.\n\n2:46:02.240 --> 2:46:03.960\n And the fact that with most digital currencies\n\n2:46:03.960 --> 2:46:06.160\n you can have hard forks very frequently\n\n2:46:06.160 --> 2:46:08.200\n and they can change the supply all the time\n\n2:46:08.200 --> 2:46:09.600\n means that there's a small group of people\n\n2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:11.880\n who agree amongst themselves how to move forward.\n\n2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:15.320\n Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there.\n\n2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:17.200\n So one is the small group.\n\n2:46:17.200 --> 2:46:18.760\n That one we could talk about.\n\n2:46:18.760 --> 2:46:21.320\n It's a tricky one, and we talked about that\n\n2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:22.680\n with Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n2:46:22.680 --> 2:46:25.720\n But the other one is small number of nodes\n\n2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:27.320\n sort of to push back on that.\n\n2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:29.000\n As computational power increases,\n\n2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.600\n you can argue that that enables more and more\n\n2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:35.720\n cheap computers to serve as nodes.\n\n2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:38.000\n So at least it paints a future\n\n2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.120\n where nodes are always increasing\n\n2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:42.400\n because computational power is always increasing\n\n2:46:42.400 --> 2:46:44.560\n and getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.\n\n2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:46.160\n So at least there's a hope for the future\n\n2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:49.120\n for greater and greater decentralization\n\n2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:50.440\n on the node front.\n\n2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:52.840\n Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again,\n\n2:46:52.840 --> 2:46:55.440\n it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have\n\n2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:59.520\n if the way that the currency is run\n\n2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:01.720\n is that you're gonna have a hard fork every few months,\n\n2:47:01.720 --> 2:47:03.520\n which is the case with most other currencies.\n\n2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:06.040\n Bitcoin's the only one that's not have a hard fork.\n\n2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:10.160\n Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin\n\n2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:12.200\n in a technical sense is that you could get\n\n2:47:12.200 --> 2:47:16.840\n the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009\n\n2:47:16.840 --> 2:47:18.520\n to start the network.\n\n2:47:18.520 --> 2:47:21.680\n And you could run it today\n\n2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:23.160\n and it would sync with the blockchain.\n\n2:47:23.160 --> 2:47:25.400\n There's one bug you need to fix,\n\n2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:28.440\n one mistake that would have only appeared\n\n2:47:28.440 --> 2:47:31.560\n I think in around 2013 or 14 or something like that,\n\n2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:33.000\n so that he wasn't aware of back then.\n\n2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:35.480\n So you just need to fix this one tiny little bug.\n\n2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:37.640\n And then the consensus parameters are still the same.\n\n2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:39.360\n So you're able to sync to it.\n\n2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:41.480\n This is not true for most other digital currencies.\n\n2:47:41.480 --> 2:47:42.880\n I'd say probably all of them\n\n2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:44.840\n because they've all had many hard forks,\n\n2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:46.320\n which they think of as upgrades.\n\n2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:49.360\n And they market this thing as,\n\n2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:52.440\n well, Bitcoin can't upgrade, but we upgrade all the time.\n\n2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:55.240\n Well, yeah, you know what else upgrades all the time?\n\n2:47:55.240 --> 2:47:57.160\n Facebook, Apple, Amazon,\n\n2:47:57.160 --> 2:47:59.360\n anything that centralizes is very easy to upgrade.\n\n2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:01.400\n And that's precisely why, as Michael Saylor says,\n\n2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:03.640\n these things are somebody's liability.\n\n2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:04.600\n They are security.\n\n2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:07.120\n You're carrying on somebody's technical\n\n2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:08.720\n and economic liability.\n\n2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:12.680\n They can hard fork, they can 10x the supply tomorrow.\n\n2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:17.680\n Yeah, they can fall victim to the same corrupting forces\n\n2:48:19.680 --> 2:48:21.800\n that governments fall victim to.\n\n2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:22.960\n Sure, and for people who don't know,\n\n2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:27.960\n yeah, hard fork is a reverse incompatible change\n\n2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:34.240\n to the underlying function of a cryptocurrency.\n\n2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:40.080\n Of course, there is hard forks of Bitcoin as well.\n\n2:48:40.080 --> 2:48:43.240\n I'm sure all of which you love dearly.\n\n2:48:43.240 --> 2:48:44.800\n Anyway, but that doesn't matter.\n\n2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:47.160\n The original Bitcoin, for the most part,\n\n2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:49.920\n has not undergone any changes.\n\n2:48:49.920 --> 2:48:50.760\n And that's one of the...\n\n2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:51.960\n I mean, it has undergone changes,\n\n2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:56.960\n but none in the important parameters of the network.\n\n2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:00.000\n So another criticism is about energy.\n\n2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:02.640\n So the proof of work,\n\n2:49:02.640 --> 2:49:05.160\n consensus mechanism uses a lot of energy.\n\n2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:08.680\n What's the response to that criticism of Bitcoin?\n\n2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:10.760\n Yes, because it's worth it.\n\n2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:14.760\n Okay, the airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak.\n\n2:49:14.760 --> 2:49:16.840\n You know, when you're gonna cross the Atlantic next time,\n\n2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:17.680\n what are you gonna take?\n\n2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:19.640\n A kayak that is environmentally friendly,\n\n2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:21.640\n according to this insane definition,\n\n2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:22.840\n or are you gonna take an airplane\n\n2:49:22.840 --> 2:49:24.040\n that consumes a lot of energy?\n\n2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:26.800\n So the cost benefit analysis here,\n\n2:49:28.040 --> 2:49:29.520\n essentially, you have to consider\n\n2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:31.360\n both the cost and the benefit.\n\n2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.880\n Exactly, and I think it's an astonishing testament\n\n2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:38.520\n to just how far backward people's scientific\n\n2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:41.400\n and technological thinking has devolved\n\n2:49:41.400 --> 2:49:43.360\n to the point where we think of energy consumption\n\n2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:44.200\n as a bad thing.\n\n2:49:44.200 --> 2:49:45.040\n I think it's just...\n\n2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:46.280\n And in the Fiat standard,\n\n2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:48.920\n I discussed the whole hysteria around energy,\n\n2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:52.760\n and I think it's a product of Fiat inflation\n\n2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:55.160\n because it's a way of trying to covering up\n\n2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:58.400\n the fact that energy fuels that are reliable\n\n2:49:58.400 --> 2:50:00.560\n and necessary for the current world\n\n2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:03.640\n are becoming more and more expensive because of inflation.\n\n2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:05.800\n And so governments are always looking for excuses\n\n2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:07.880\n for why you should not be using those things.\n\n2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:10.160\n And so they promote all kinds of stupid pseudosciences\n\n2:50:10.160 --> 2:50:13.320\n that tell you about why these things are bad.\n\n2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:16.960\n But really, you know, all technology is...\n\n2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:19.760\n Well, not all, but the vast majority\n\n2:50:19.760 --> 2:50:22.160\n of technological innovations involve\n\n2:50:22.160 --> 2:50:24.520\n economizing on human time and judgment\n\n2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:26.000\n and replacing it with machines,\n\n2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.440\n with reliable machines that spend a lot of energy.\n\n2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:31.040\n So that's what a telephone does.\n\n2:50:31.040 --> 2:50:33.200\n Instead of having to send somebody across the world\n\n2:50:33.200 --> 2:50:36.120\n to tell somebody something else or send a letter,\n\n2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:38.760\n a telephone allows you to do it.\n\n2:50:38.760 --> 2:50:39.840\n The car is like that.\n\n2:50:39.840 --> 2:50:43.040\n You could walk, but a car consumes a lot more energy,\n\n2:50:43.040 --> 2:50:45.280\n but it allows you to travel much faster and safer\n\n2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:47.200\n and more reliably.\n\n2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:48.720\n An airplane is like that.\n\n2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:52.440\n Modern telecommunication, human prosperity\n\n2:50:52.440 --> 2:50:54.680\n is an increase in the consumption of energy.\n\n2:50:54.680 --> 2:50:58.800\n And I think it is an absolutely criminal thing.\n\n2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:01.640\n I mean, genuinely mean the word criminal\n\n2:51:01.640 --> 2:51:04.840\n to portray energy consumption as a bad thing,\n\n2:51:04.840 --> 2:51:07.280\n because it is truly depriving people of the chance\n\n2:51:07.280 --> 2:51:10.320\n to live a life that makes life better, you know?\n\n2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:12.480\n It's truly criminal to tell poor countries\n\n2:51:12.480 --> 2:51:15.440\n that they should not consume the same energy sources\n\n2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:17.720\n that are being used in rich countries\n\n2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:21.880\n on which our modern infrastructure and modern life relies.\n\n2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:22.800\n That's what life is.\n\n2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:25.760\n You know, if you reduce the consumption of energy in the US\n\n2:51:25.760 --> 2:51:28.520\n to the levels that you have in poor countries today,\n\n2:51:28.520 --> 2:51:30.320\n the US would become desperately poor.\n\n2:51:30.320 --> 2:51:31.440\n A lot of people would die.\n\n2:51:31.440 --> 2:51:32.520\n Cities would collapse.\n\n2:51:32.520 --> 2:51:34.560\n The quality of life would decrease significantly.\n\n2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:37.120\n A high quality of life often requires,\n\n2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:39.600\n given the current technology, a high expenditure of energy.\n\n2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:41.080\n Yeah, and I should be clear, you know,\n\n2:51:41.080 --> 2:51:42.760\n it's not a quality of life in the sense of,\n\n2:51:42.760 --> 2:51:43.920\n many people think of this as,\n\n2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:45.160\n oh yeah, well, you know,\n\n2:51:46.560 --> 2:51:50.240\n taking needless flights for vacations.\n\n2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:53.440\n No, no, these are the cherries on top of the cake,\n\n2:51:53.440 --> 2:51:54.960\n but the substance of the cake\n\n2:51:54.960 --> 2:51:56.920\n and the real benefits of energy\n\n2:51:56.920 --> 2:52:00.800\n is the fact that children, premature babies,\n\n2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:03.520\n survive in countries that have reliable\n\n2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:05.560\n 24 hour cheap electricity.\n\n2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:07.200\n If your child is born premature,\n\n2:52:07.200 --> 2:52:08.640\n that you put in an incubator,\n\n2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:10.440\n put him in an incubator or her,\n\n2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:11.840\n they're highly likely to survive.\n\n2:52:11.840 --> 2:52:14.200\n If you don't have 24 hour electricity,\n\n2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:16.040\n that child is not gonna make it.\n\n2:52:16.040 --> 2:52:18.920\n And you see it, you know,\n\n2:52:18.920 --> 2:52:20.760\n the level of energy consumption per capita\n\n2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:23.400\n is highly correlated, not just to income,\n\n2:52:23.400 --> 2:52:26.280\n but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality,\n\n2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:28.440\n to all of the things that you care about.\n\n2:52:28.440 --> 2:52:31.840\n And Bitcoin is just another technology.\n\n2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:34.640\n It does consume a lot more energy than central banks.\n\n2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:37.840\n A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this\n\n2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:40.120\n by saying, well, you know, central banks consume money\n\n2:52:40.120 --> 2:52:42.720\n and ATMs consume a lot of energy.\n\n2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:44.200\n And I think if you calculate\n\n2:52:44.200 --> 2:52:45.880\n how much central banks and banks consume,\n\n2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:47.040\n I think it's a rounding error\n\n2:52:47.040 --> 2:52:49.680\n next to what Bitcoin consumes.\n\n2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:52.160\n I think Bitcoin is just, maybe not a rounding error,\n\n2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:54.520\n but it's still, Bitcoin I think is going to consume\n\n2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:56.240\n a lot more, and that's a good thing.\n\n2:52:56.240 --> 2:52:58.160\n You know what's humbling is to look,\n\n2:52:58.160 --> 2:53:00.080\n because even just looking into this\n\n2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:02.440\n forces me to look at the energy expenditures\n\n2:53:02.440 --> 2:53:04.640\n for many of the things we take for granted.\n\n2:53:04.640 --> 2:53:07.280\n Obviously computers and other digital,\n\n2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:11.960\n our digital lives are just, Bitcoin becomes a rounding error\n\n2:53:12.880 --> 2:53:15.040\n relative to how much energy is spent\n\n2:53:15.040 --> 2:53:16.800\n on all the computers in our world.\n\n2:53:16.800 --> 2:53:19.800\n But also things like home appliances,\n\n2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:22.640\n microwaves, and hair dryers and stuff.\n\n2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:23.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:24.360\n It's that.\n\n2:53:24.360 --> 2:53:26.680\n Yeah, I mean, this is, that's being hilarious.\n\n2:53:26.680 --> 2:53:28.280\n It's like, oh, these things\n\n2:53:28.280 --> 2:53:31.360\n that are just part of our modern life,\n\n2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:33.240\n they're either the same order,\n\n2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:35.880\n at least the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin,\n\n2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:39.280\n and they seem like trivial parts of life.\n\n2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:40.600\n Yeah, and this is the thing,\n\n2:53:40.600 --> 2:53:41.720\n all of the people that complain\n\n2:53:41.720 --> 2:53:43.200\n about Bitcoin's energy consumption,\n\n2:53:43.200 --> 2:53:45.080\n I presume they use washing machines.\n\n2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:49.960\n Now, why should their desire for clean and dry clothes\n\n2:53:51.000 --> 2:53:52.160\n get to consume energy?\n\n2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:54.960\n And I mean, I used to live in Lebanon.\n\n2:53:54.960 --> 2:53:56.320\n Lebanon had hyperinflation.\n\n2:53:56.320 --> 2:53:58.920\n I escaped from hyperinflation.\n\n2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:00.560\n I escaped, it prevented,\n\n2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:03.600\n my life could have been ruined by hyperinflation.\n\n2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:04.680\n And the reason that it wasn't ruined\n\n2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:06.160\n is because I have Bitcoin.\n\n2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:10.120\n So, I don't know, am I allowed to swear on your podcast?\n\n2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:10.960\n Yes, please.\n\n2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:12.120\n So, fuck your washing machine.\n\n2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:16.600\n given a choice between my washing machine\n\n2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:18.760\n and my Bitcoin, I'll choose Bitcoin.\n\n2:54:18.760 --> 2:54:20.440\n It's a technology that has been,\n\n2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:21.640\n that has already saved my life,\n\n2:54:21.640 --> 2:54:22.760\n and I think it's gonna save the lives\n\n2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:24.400\n of many, many, many, many more people.\n\n2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:27.440\n So, but of course, I don't have to choose\n\n2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:31.120\n between my Bitcoin and my washing machine\n\n2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:33.280\n because this is, you know,\n\n2:54:33.280 --> 2:54:35.160\n we're just constantly consuming more energy\n\n2:54:35.160 --> 2:54:36.680\n and we're gonna continue to consume more energy\n\n2:54:36.680 --> 2:54:39.880\n in this world, and that's just what progress is.\n\n2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:41.480\n And a small remark.\n\n2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:43.840\n So, in principle, I don't think this is a problem,\n\n2:54:43.840 --> 2:54:45.000\n but the other thing about Bitcoin,\n\n2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.360\n where it is different from washing machines,\n\n2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:48.880\n Bitcoin is truly unique in this.\n\n2:54:48.880 --> 2:54:52.840\n It's the only thing whose energy consumption\n\n2:54:52.840 --> 2:54:55.200\n can be produced absolutely anywhere.\n\n2:54:55.200 --> 2:54:57.280\n Your washing machine needs to be in your house\n\n2:54:57.280 --> 2:54:58.920\n where you live, and you live in a city\n\n2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:00.720\n surrounded by 10 million people,\n\n2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:02.920\n and they all have their washing machines,\n\n2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:04.520\n and they're all connected to the grid,\n\n2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:06.520\n and they generally tend to do their laundry\n\n2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:07.960\n around the same time.\n\n2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:11.360\n And so you have to put the load of the washing machine\n\n2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:14.360\n on the grid at the same time.\n\n2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:16.320\n There needs to be one power plant\n\n2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:17.920\n and all of the infrastructure needs to work\n\n2:55:17.920 --> 2:55:19.200\n at the same time, and the electricity\n\n2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:21.720\n is pretty expensive because it's being done\n\n2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:23.360\n in a place with high demand.\n\n2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:26.240\n Bitcoin does not need to buy electricity\n\n2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:28.360\n from places where it has high demand\n\n2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:30.320\n because it can buy electricity from anywhere.\n\n2:55:30.320 --> 2:55:32.320\n This is what's truly mind blowing about it.\n\n2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:35.600\n You can buy, you know, what you need,\n\n2:55:35.600 --> 2:55:37.200\n the electricity that you need for mining\n\n2:55:37.200 --> 2:55:38.280\n can be done anywhere.\n\n2:55:38.280 --> 2:55:42.120\n So you can mine, you know, you can have a waterfall\n\n2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:44.560\n in the north of Canada, 300 miles away\n\n2:55:44.560 --> 2:55:46.480\n from any population center.\n\n2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:48.520\n There's water falling, there's energy.\n\n2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:51.120\n You can put a hydroelectric dam there,\n\n2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:53.480\n and then you can use that energy to operate the miners,\n\n2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:54.800\n and then the miners just need\n\n2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:56.680\n a satellite internet connection,\n\n2:55:56.680 --> 2:55:58.760\n and effectively you're selling that energy\n\n2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:01.160\n that is isolated to the grid.\n\n2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:02.920\n And because of the way that Bitcoin functions,\n\n2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:04.840\n because of the difficulty adjustment,\n\n2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:07.240\n the only profitable miners are the ones\n\n2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:09.240\n who can get cheap electricity.\n\n2:56:09.240 --> 2:56:11.680\n Basically if you're mining at grid cost,\n\n2:56:11.680 --> 2:56:14.560\n if you're mining at around, the average electricity price\n\n2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:16.760\n in the world is around 14 cents.\n\n2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:19.160\n If you're mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin,\n\n2:56:19.160 --> 2:56:21.360\n you're most likely not gonna make it.\n\n2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:23.920\n If you're running your miners at 14 cents,\n\n2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:26.040\n because everybody could mine at 14 cents,\n\n2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:28.720\n and so what happens is if everybody's mining\n\n2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:32.720\n at 14 cents, 14 cents stops being profitable,\n\n2:56:32.720 --> 2:56:33.960\n and then only the people mining\n\n2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:35.480\n at a lower price are profitable.\n\n2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:38.360\n So that's why Bitcoin mining is not competing\n\n2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:39.360\n with your washing machine.\n\n2:56:39.360 --> 2:56:41.040\n This is the absurd thing\n\n2:56:41.040 --> 2:56:45.480\n about this kind of energy scarcity viewpoint\n\n2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:47.000\n where, oh no, it's a catastrophe,\n\n2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:48.480\n Bitcoin is taking all the electricity,\n\n2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:51.000\n as if the electricity is just one fixed pie\n\n2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:53.160\n that we all have to share and fight over.\n\n2:56:53.160 --> 2:56:54.960\n And this is how I keep making fun\n\n2:56:54.960 --> 2:56:56.400\n of these stupid headlines they put out\n\n2:56:56.400 --> 2:56:58.600\n where Bitcoin's consuming more electricity\n\n2:56:58.600 --> 2:56:59.720\n than Portugal.\n\n2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:03.080\n All right, well, maybe we should shut down Portugal then.\n\n2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:04.880\n What the hell is Portugal giving us?\n\n2:57:04.880 --> 2:57:07.240\n Like, obviously it's not, it's not competing.\n\n2:57:07.240 --> 2:57:09.320\n He doesn't mean that, I've gotten so much criticism\n\n2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:13.280\n for saying Cristiano Ronaldo's not in the top five.\n\n2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:16.160\n I apologize, I love Portugal.\n\n2:57:16.160 --> 2:57:18.640\n That's another discussion we should get into at some point.\n\n2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:20.440\n Because you posted a few soccer things.\n\n2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:23.440\n I'm not, I realize how passionate people are about this.\n\n2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:25.040\n Listen, it was a joke, all right?\n\n2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:27.520\n He deserves to be potentially in the top five.\n\n2:57:27.520 --> 2:57:28.920\n Yeah, I love Portugal.\n\n2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:30.400\n And even though I'm a Liverpool fan,\n\n2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:32.440\n I still respect Cristiano Ronaldo a lot.\n\n2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:35.520\n In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion\n\n2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:37.680\n where I think Cristiano Ronaldo's\n\n2:57:37.680 --> 2:57:39.040\n the greatest football player ever.\n\n2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:41.640\n Number one, over Pel\u00e9 and Maradona, Messi,\n\n2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:42.480\n better than Messi.\n\n2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:44.120\n Yes, he's been doing it for 20 years at the top.\n\n2:57:44.120 --> 2:57:45.000\n Nobody's ever done that.\n\n2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:46.520\n He's won everything everywhere,\n\n2:57:46.520 --> 2:57:49.240\n everywhere he goes at the top, at the Champions League.\n\n2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:53.080\n Really strong argument to be made for him.\n\n2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:55.120\n Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona,\n\n2:57:55.120 --> 2:57:55.960\n that's the thing.\n\n2:57:55.960 --> 2:57:59.400\n So you appreciate performance, long term,\n\n2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:03.620\n versus the genius of the actual play on the field.\n\n2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:05.760\n I mean, the genius is,\n\n2:58:05.760 --> 2:58:07.640\n Ronaldo's the top scorer of all time.\n\n2:58:07.640 --> 2:58:08.480\n He scores more goals.\n\n2:58:08.480 --> 2:58:09.320\n So the genius is in the scoring,\n\n2:58:09.320 --> 2:58:13.480\n not the actual dance of the play, the creativity.\n\n2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:14.680\n Well, I mean, I don't know,\n\n2:58:14.680 --> 2:58:18.240\n Messi's been absolutely mediocre since he's left Barcelona.\n\n2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:20.080\n These are strong words.\n\n2:58:20.080 --> 2:58:23.240\n He scored, what, two goals in PSG season this year?\n\n2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:25.000\n They're out of the Champions League.\n\n2:58:25.000 --> 2:58:26.600\n What about Mohamed Salah?\n\n2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:28.040\n You posted about him.\n\n2:58:28.040 --> 2:58:31.520\n Is he climbing up to be someone?\n\n2:58:31.520 --> 2:58:33.080\n I think he should win the Ballon dOr this year.\n\n2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:34.780\n He probably should have won it last year as well.\n\n2:58:34.780 --> 2:58:36.240\n He's been absolutely outstanding,\n\n2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:39.740\n but I mean, just people are so crazy about Messi.\n\n2:58:39.740 --> 2:58:40.800\n They keep giving him accolades.\n\n2:58:40.800 --> 2:58:41.840\n He hasn't deserved, I think,\n\n2:58:41.840 --> 2:58:45.040\n Messi the last couple of Ballon dOrs that he got.\n\n2:58:45.040 --> 2:58:46.400\n I mean, he's a great player and everything,\n\n2:58:46.400 --> 2:58:49.300\n but no, he did not deserve it last year.\n\n2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:53.940\n We can agree to disagree.\n\n2:58:53.940 --> 2:58:54.780\n There's something.\n\n2:58:54.780 --> 2:58:56.800\n Do you think you're a Barca fan or a Messi fan?\n\n2:58:56.800 --> 2:58:59.600\n I would say, no, I wouldn't say I'm a Barca fan,\n\n2:58:59.600 --> 2:59:01.280\n but a Barca fan because of Messi,\n\n2:59:01.280 --> 2:59:04.700\n and I just, I think it's like, there's certain things.\n\n2:59:06.760 --> 2:59:09.840\n So when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, Russia,\n\n2:59:09.840 --> 2:59:14.840\n I remember Maradona, he was the first person I saw\n\n2:59:15.180 --> 2:59:17.620\n that I was like, oh, wow, this could be,\n\n2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:22.280\n this is greatness in sport, not just football and sport,\n\n2:59:22.280 --> 2:59:23.680\n right, and for some reason.\n\n2:59:23.680 --> 2:59:26.760\n I mean, it's something about Diego Armando Maradona,\n\n2:59:26.760 --> 2:59:30.160\n the way they were commentating the genius of his play,\n\n2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:32.960\n the mix of ego, and again, the performance,\n\n2:59:32.960 --> 2:59:35.400\n but being able to carry a team on his shoulders,\n\n2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:38.680\n that, I just fell in love with whatever he represented,\n\n2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:41.560\n and then by that, Argentina, and then Messi,\n\n2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:46.120\n I saw when he was 16, 17, when he was just in the early days,\n\n2:59:46.120 --> 2:59:49.560\n and when you first see a person and you see the genius\n\n2:59:49.560 --> 2:59:51.660\n and you notice that, and then it turns out\n\n2:59:51.660 --> 2:59:54.080\n to be actually a great player, for some reason,\n\n2:59:54.080 --> 2:59:57.440\n you're invested, you're emotionally invested,\n\n2:59:57.440 --> 3:00:00.560\n you're, I don't know, so you kind of just fall in love\n\n3:00:00.560 --> 3:00:03.060\n and then you get, you pick sides.\n\n3:00:03.060 --> 3:00:04.560\n I mean, that's the thing about football.\n\n3:00:04.560 --> 3:00:07.640\n Part of the fun things about football, soccer,\n\n3:00:07.640 --> 3:00:11.200\n is like, you pick a guy, you pick a team,\n\n3:00:11.200 --> 3:00:13.780\n and fuck everyone else, and you just have fun talking shit.\n\n3:00:13.780 --> 3:00:15.440\n I mean, that's part of it, you know?\n\n3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:18.360\n It's great, it's great because I think,\n\n3:00:18.360 --> 3:00:19.760\n obviously it's a very stupid thing to do,\n\n3:00:19.760 --> 3:00:21.800\n but I think if you don't do it in football,\n\n3:00:21.800 --> 3:00:22.640\n you're gonna do it in real life.\n\n3:00:22.640 --> 3:00:23.800\n Elsewhere, that's right.\n\n3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:26.240\n That's why it's very good, like, that's it.\n\n3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:28.360\n Instead of hating people for their religion\n\n3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:31.000\n and for their skin color, hate them\n\n3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:32.440\n because they support Manchester United.\n\n3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:33.960\n Exactly.\n\n3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:35.160\n So you're a Liverpool fan, that's it.\n\n3:00:35.160 --> 3:00:37.300\n Yes, yes, hardcore, long term.\n\n3:00:38.860 --> 3:00:41.820\n But yeah, so to go back to the original point on Portugal.\n\n3:00:41.820 --> 3:00:42.660\n Energy.\n\n3:00:42.660 --> 3:00:43.500\n Yeah, energy.\n\n3:00:43.500 --> 3:00:45.900\n Bitcoin is not competing with Portugal\n\n3:00:45.900 --> 3:00:47.400\n because Bitcoin is buying energy\n\n3:00:47.400 --> 3:00:49.220\n from places where we can't buy it,\n\n3:00:49.220 --> 3:00:52.240\n because all the places where we can buy energy\n\n3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:55.360\n for our washing machines, we're bidding up the price\n\n3:00:55.360 --> 3:00:58.000\n enough to make it nonviable for Bitcoin.\n\n3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:00.240\n That's why, you know, you'll see those headlines\n\n3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:02.360\n about Bitcoin consuming more energy than Portugal.\n\n3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:04.200\n Well, if you look at Portugal, I mean,\n\n3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:06.080\n they've got giant power plants in Portugal,\n\n3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:07.400\n they've got millions of people,\n\n3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:09.720\n and they've got enormous amounts of infrastructure.\n\n3:01:09.720 --> 3:01:13.200\n Where are all of these infrastructure for Bitcoin mining?\n\n3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:14.840\n You don't see it in the cities.\n\n3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:18.800\n It's all isolated, it's all out away from the cities,\n\n3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:21.920\n or it's connected to grids that have serious overcapacity.\n\n3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:25.160\n So Bitcoin is not out there buying the expensive energy,\n\n3:01:25.160 --> 3:01:29.120\n taking energy away from people who can't afford it.\n\n3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:30.860\n It's out there buying its own energy\n\n3:01:30.860 --> 3:01:32.600\n because it doesn't need to buy the expensive energy\n\n3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:34.400\n that people really need.\n\n3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:37.440\n So one other criticism from an investment perspective,\n\n3:01:37.440 --> 3:01:39.440\n from a gambling perspective that people see\n\n3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:41.520\n is the volatility of Bitcoin.\n\n3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:44.000\n Of course, that's been somewhat decreasing over time,\n\n3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:48.640\n but what's your answer to the sort of criticism\n\n3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:51.360\n that Bitcoin is too volatile, I wanna stay away,\n\n3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:53.320\n it doesn't seem like a safe place for me\n\n3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:57.020\n to invest either short term or long term?\n\n3:01:57.020 --> 3:01:58.520\n There's no denying there's a volatility\n\n3:01:58.520 --> 3:02:00.320\n and there's a high oscillation in the value\n\n3:02:00.320 --> 3:02:01.160\n in the short term.\n\n3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:05.360\n So I think the safe way to approach that\n\n3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:07.760\n is in terms of position sizing.\n\n3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:10.560\n If the volatility bothers you,\n\n3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:12.720\n then you're overinvested perhaps.\n\n3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:17.480\n So maybe you should reduce the size of your position\n\n3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:19.640\n so that the volatility doesn't bother you.\n\n3:02:19.640 --> 3:02:23.240\n And this is the short answer that you know,\n\n3:02:23.240 --> 3:02:26.680\n like stack as much as your conviction\n\n3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:28.880\n will allow you to tolerate the volatility.\n\n3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.360\n And of course, the reason you should try\n\n3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:36.200\n and consider tolerating volatility more\n\n3:02:36.200 --> 3:02:40.440\n is the options are you hold fiat assets,\n\n3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:43.800\n which only go down stable, relatively stable,\n\n3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:46.120\n not a lot of volatility day to day,\n\n3:02:46.120 --> 3:02:50.600\n value of your dollar doesn't change 40% overnight,\n\n3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:52.880\n 20% overnight or something like that.\n\n3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:56.120\n But it does go down reliably, it's gonna go down 40%.\n\n3:02:56.120 --> 3:02:58.040\n You can count on it, it might take a year,\n\n3:02:58.040 --> 3:02:59.900\n two years, five years, 10 years,\n\n3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:01.760\n compared to the things that you want to buy,\n\n3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:04.360\n it's gonna go down by 40%.\n\n3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:05.960\n And it's not gonna come back\n\n3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:07.560\n and it's gonna go down another 40%\n\n3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:09.720\n and then another 40% and then another 40%.\n\n3:03:09.720 --> 3:03:14.720\n So the option really is relatively short term stability\n\n3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:16.520\n with long term decline,\n\n3:03:16.520 --> 3:03:19.680\n or short term volatility with long term rise.\n\n3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:22.640\n And so that's another way in which Bitcoin teaches people\n\n3:03:22.640 --> 3:03:24.760\n to have a low time preference and think about the long term.\n\n3:03:24.760 --> 3:03:29.240\n So stack, accumulate and think of it in the long term.\n\n3:03:29.240 --> 3:03:31.200\n It's a function of the fact that Bitcoin is new.\n\n3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:32.960\n Bitcoin is currently less than 1%\n\n3:03:32.960 --> 3:03:34.200\n of the global money market.\n\n3:03:34.200 --> 3:03:36.520\n So there's about $100 trillion of money\n\n3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:37.560\n out there in the world.\n\n3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:40.600\n $100 trillion roughly of fiat\n\n3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:42.800\n and about $10 trillion of gold.\n\n3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:44.880\n And Bitcoin is less than $1 trillion.\n\n3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.400\n So one rich guy decides to get into Bitcoin,\n\n3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:50.160\n that's gonna show up on the Bitcoin chart.\n\n3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:52.960\n You look at it, Elon Musk decides to buy Bitcoin,\n\n3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:55.160\n you see the buy, you see the news,\n\n3:03:55.160 --> 3:03:57.840\n it happens and you see the pump.\n\n3:03:57.840 --> 3:03:59.880\n Elon Musk decides that he doesn't like Bitcoin,\n\n3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:01.200\n you see the drop.\n\n3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:03.160\n But a few years ago, it used to be\n\n3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:07.200\n that one random millionaire would cause that pump.\n\n3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:09.800\n Now you have to be the richest guy in the world to do that.\n\n3:04:09.800 --> 3:04:11.600\n In a few years, you're gonna have to be\n\n3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:14.080\n the richest country in the world to be able to do that\n\n3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:15.920\n to the Bitcoin price, maybe many years,\n\n3:04:15.920 --> 3:04:17.160\n maybe not a few years.\n\n3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:19.120\n But as Bitcoin grows, think about it\n\n3:04:19.120 --> 3:04:22.240\n as a liquid pool of money.\n\n3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:25.280\n Currently it's a small pool next to a much larger ocean,\n\n3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:26.800\n which is the entire money market.\n\n3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:30.520\n And so one person jumps from that to this small pool,\n\n3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:32.160\n they can make a big splash.\n\n3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:36.120\n As the pool grows, essentially the salability increases\n\n3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:38.840\n and the likelihood of one individual purchase\n\n3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:43.320\n affecting the price so violently decreases.\n\n3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:46.800\n And so over time, as the size of the market increases,\n\n3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:48.920\n I think we're gonna see the volatility decline\n\n3:04:48.920 --> 3:04:49.760\n more and more.\n\n3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:52.840\n Ultimately, if you look at gold historically,\n\n3:04:52.840 --> 3:04:54.680\n gold has been very, very stable.\n\n3:04:54.680 --> 3:04:56.360\n It did not achieve its stability\n\n3:04:56.360 --> 3:04:58.600\n because the central bank was in charge of gold supply\n\n3:04:58.600 --> 3:05:00.880\n or because there was a gold committee\n\n3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:02.920\n that decided how much gold gets produced.\n\n3:05:03.960 --> 3:05:06.760\n It achieved that stability because it became\n\n3:05:06.760 --> 3:05:09.880\n the most saleable good and so therefore became the good\n\n3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:12.880\n that contains the most cash balances in the world.\n\n3:05:12.880 --> 3:05:14.080\n And the end of the 19th century,\n\n3:05:14.080 --> 3:05:16.840\n everybody held cash balances in gold\n\n3:05:16.840 --> 3:05:20.720\n and new production was a tiny little addition\n\n3:05:20.720 --> 3:05:23.680\n to global production, to the supply.\n\n3:05:23.680 --> 3:05:26.880\n So that's what made gold the most relatively,\n\n3:05:26.880 --> 3:05:27.920\n I shouldn't say stable\n\n3:05:27.920 --> 3:05:29.800\n because nothing is stable in economics,\n\n3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:31.920\n but relatively it holds onto its value\n\n3:05:31.920 --> 3:05:35.120\n and it's much less volatile than digital currency,\n\n3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:37.240\n than national currencies.\n\n3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:41.280\n That's because it has the highest stock to flow ratio\n\n3:05:41.280 --> 3:05:45.920\n and that's because its supply is a tiny fraction\n\n3:05:45.920 --> 3:05:47.360\n of the liquid market.\n\n3:05:47.360 --> 3:05:48.840\n And as the liquid market grows,\n\n3:05:48.840 --> 3:05:50.400\n as the size of cash balances grows\n\n3:05:50.400 --> 3:05:52.920\n and trades in Bitcoin cancel each other out,\n\n3:05:54.000 --> 3:05:56.920\n you get only slight changes in value.\n\n3:05:56.920 --> 3:06:01.040\n So I think as Bitcoin matures, that's going to decline.\n\n3:06:01.040 --> 3:06:03.680\n So effectively, I think the end game\n\n3:06:03.680 --> 3:06:08.680\n is Bitcoin is huge, Bitcoin is worth something like,\n\n3:06:08.760 --> 3:06:11.720\n I think the total addressable market for Bitcoin\n\n3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:14.000\n is not just national currencies\n\n3:06:14.000 --> 3:06:16.560\n and gold's addressable market, but also government bonds.\n\n3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:17.920\n That's the really big one.\n\n3:06:17.920 --> 3:06:20.160\n So how do banks compare to gold?\n\n3:06:20.160 --> 3:06:23.240\n So you're saying it'll surpass gold, the 10 trillion?\n\n3:06:23.240 --> 3:06:24.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:25.240\n What's bonds?\n\n3:06:25.240 --> 3:06:26.880\n Where does bonds stand?\n\n3:06:26.880 --> 3:06:28.840\n So then there's also national currencies,\n\n3:06:28.840 --> 3:06:30.040\n which are about 100 trillion\n\n3:06:30.040 --> 3:06:31.160\n and then there's government bonds,\n\n3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:36.160\n which are around $120 billion, sorry, trillion dollars.\n\n3:06:36.320 --> 3:06:37.160\n Trillion.\n\n3:06:37.160 --> 3:06:38.000\n Trillion, sorry.\n\n3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:38.840\n Yes, trillion.\n\n3:06:38.840 --> 3:06:40.400\n If we're saying billion, we meant trillion.\n\n3:06:40.400 --> 3:06:41.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:46.240\n So you think bonds can move to Bitcoin?\n\n3:06:46.240 --> 3:06:50.120\n I've always held this is the prize, this is the main dish.\n\n3:06:50.120 --> 3:06:52.680\n Gold is the appetizer, bonds are the main dish\n\n3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:53.520\n because bonds have replaced gold.\n\n3:06:53.520 --> 3:06:54.720\n I have an appetizer.\n\n3:06:54.720 --> 3:06:56.640\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:56.640 --> 3:06:59.880\n I mean, bonds have replaced gold in people's portfolio.\n\n3:06:59.880 --> 3:07:02.520\n People, you remember when we were saying gold was,\n\n3:07:02.520 --> 3:07:04.080\n you'd hold it as a saving,\n\n3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:05.560\n as the secure part of your portfolio\n\n3:07:05.560 --> 3:07:08.120\n and then you take risk with the equity.\n\n3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:09.120\n Currently people do that\n\n3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:11.520\n by holding a part of their portfolio in bonds.\n\n3:07:11.520 --> 3:07:14.720\n That's the part that they treat as their saving account.\n\n3:07:14.720 --> 3:07:18.160\n And then the rest they use for not speculation,\n\n3:07:18.160 --> 3:07:19.920\n for investment in which they take risk.\n\n3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:21.360\n Yeah, speculation.\n\n3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:26.360\n And that's stocks and equity and other high risk assets.\n\n3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:29.720\n I think Bitcoin is not gonna replace equity.\n\n3:07:29.720 --> 3:07:30.840\n There will always be equity.\n\n3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:31.760\n There'll always be companies\n\n3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:34.160\n and people will wanna have equity.\n\n3:07:34.160 --> 3:07:35.640\n But it'll probably replace a big chunk\n\n3:07:35.640 --> 3:07:36.880\n of current equity markets\n\n3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:39.120\n because right now, if you want to save,\n\n3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:40.560\n it used to be that you hold bonds.\n\n3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:43.400\n Now, if you wanna save, you go into stock indexes.\n\n3:07:43.400 --> 3:07:46.160\n So I think Bitcoin likely eats a big chunk\n\n3:07:46.160 --> 3:07:49.600\n of equity markets because currently it's,\n\n3:07:49.600 --> 3:07:51.120\n people are using it as saving.\n\n3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:53.440\n And I think it eats all the bonds.\n\n3:07:53.440 --> 3:07:56.800\n That's my most ambitious statement.\n\n3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:00.560\n The question is the scale of time that happens across,\n\n3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:03.520\n but the most important statement you make is about trend.\n\n3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:05.600\n Yeah, and also, I mean, let's also remember\n\n3:08:05.600 --> 3:08:08.880\n currently bonds nominally don't beat inflation\n\n3:08:08.880 --> 3:08:09.880\n and in real terms,\n\n3:08:09.880 --> 3:08:13.320\n they don't come close to beating inflation.\n\n3:08:13.320 --> 3:08:15.800\n So currently with bonds,\n\n3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:19.640\n you're taking on credit default risk to buy a bond\n\n3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:23.720\n and also getting less money back in real terms.\n\n3:08:23.720 --> 3:08:26.120\n Well, Bitcoin doesn't offer you returns,\n\n3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:28.160\n but in real terms, it appreciates much more\n\n3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:31.320\n and it has, I believe, a lot less risk associated with it\n\n3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:34.000\n than any company or government.\n\n3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:35.480\n So let's make things spicy\n\n3:08:35.480 --> 3:08:39.380\n and ask if Bitcoin fails in the long term future.\n\n3:08:40.280 --> 3:08:43.240\n As you just said, economics, volatility,\n\n3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:44.960\n things happen in this world.\n\n3:08:44.960 --> 3:08:48.400\n The human civilization might end in this century.\n\n3:08:48.400 --> 3:08:50.200\n I hope it doesn't, but it might.\n\n3:08:50.200 --> 3:08:52.120\n There could be catastrophic events.\n\n3:08:52.120 --> 3:08:57.120\n If Bitcoin fails, it goes to zero, loses its number one spot.\n\n3:08:57.360 --> 3:08:58.840\n What would be the reason?\n\n3:08:58.840 --> 3:09:03.840\n If you're an alien visiting Earth 100 years from now\n\n3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:05.840\n and just were to analyze the situation,\n\n3:09:05.840 --> 3:09:07.920\n Bitcoin is a pretty new thing.\n\n3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:10.480\n So the possible trajectories of how the world evolves\n\n3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:13.200\n together with this new monetary technology\n\n3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:15.080\n is nearly infinite.\n\n3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:17.280\n So if it fails, one of those trajectories\n\n3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:19.360\n surely involves Bitcoin failing.\n\n3:09:19.360 --> 3:09:21.360\n What would be the reason?\n\n3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:23.680\n I think the most likely reason that it could fail,\n\n3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:25.800\n I don't think this is likely in general,\n\n3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:27.280\n but I think it is the most likely\n\n3:09:27.280 --> 3:09:30.480\n of all the unlikely things that could destroy Bitcoin,\n\n3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:33.240\n is governments go back on a gold standard.\n\n3:09:34.240 --> 3:09:35.360\n Oh, interesting.\n\n3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:38.320\n So they make, in your view, a better decision\n\n3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:41.440\n than the current system, just not the best decision.\n\n3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:42.280\n Yeah.\n\n3:09:42.280 --> 3:09:44.040\n I thought you would go much darker.\n\n3:09:44.040 --> 3:09:47.440\n But, so that's, yeah, okay, interesting.\n\n3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:50.020\n So maybe because of Russia, because of China and so on,\n\n3:09:50.020 --> 3:09:52.160\n because of the current war,\n\n3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:57.160\n they might reconsider the power that America holds\n\n3:09:57.560 --> 3:09:59.240\n because of the monetary,\n\n3:09:59.240 --> 3:10:01.120\n because it being the primary currency,\n\n3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:05.520\n and they'll start thinking about going on a gold standard.\n\n3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:08.160\n Yeah, but it would also require the US and the Europeans\n\n3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:10.280\n and everybody to want to join in this system\n\n3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:13.200\n and sing Kumbaya and play nice with each other\n\n3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:15.280\n around the gold standard.\n\n3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:17.160\n I think, you know, given that gold already\n\n3:10:17.160 --> 3:10:19.560\n is about 10 times larger than Bitcoin,\n\n3:10:19.560 --> 3:10:21.320\n so it has a first mover advantage,\n\n3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:25.640\n if governments were to go and peg their currencies\n\n3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:30.640\n to gold again, the price of gold would shoot up 5, 10x,\n\n3:10:30.720 --> 3:10:33.480\n and it would rise in value a lot more.\n\n3:10:33.480 --> 3:10:36.120\n Of course, that doesn't necessarily kill Bitcoin.\n\n3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:37.800\n No, again, I'm not saying it's likely to happen.\n\n3:10:37.800 --> 3:10:41.400\n I'm saying it's, I imagine, less likely,\n\n3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:44.280\n less unlikely than all the other unlikely scenarios.\n\n3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:46.560\n Because, you know, even with a nuclear war,\n\n3:10:46.560 --> 3:10:50.320\n like 90% of the planet is destroyed,\n\n3:10:50.320 --> 3:10:52.960\n the 10% continue to run Bitcoin.\n\n3:10:55.880 --> 3:10:57.160\n That's a quote.\n\n3:10:57.160 --> 3:10:59.400\n Okay, there's a movement,\n\n3:10:59.400 --> 3:11:03.520\n a community of people referred to as Bitcoin maximalists.\n\n3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:05.640\n I've seen you referred, at least in the past,\n\n3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:10.160\n as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists,\n\n3:11:10.160 --> 3:11:12.320\n probably because of your book,\n\n3:11:12.320 --> 3:11:14.720\n Bitcoin Standard, consider the Bible in general.\n\n3:11:14.720 --> 3:11:16.680\n You're one of the leaders in this space.\n\n3:11:18.200 --> 3:11:22.000\n Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision\n\n3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:25.760\n that often or perhaps sometimes originates\n\n3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:26.760\n from this community?\n\n3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:28.960\n Definitely not.\n\n3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:31.640\n I'm not in the position to regret other people's actions,\n\n3:11:31.640 --> 3:11:33.280\n so let's just be clear.\n\n3:11:33.280 --> 3:11:36.260\n I think the rhetoric of community is,\n\n3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:41.160\n I reject this rhetoric because I think it's a way\n\n3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:45.880\n for kind of political manipulation and subversion\n\n3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:49.640\n to try and portray people as part of a community\n\n3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:52.100\n and hold people responsible for other people's actions,\n\n3:11:52.100 --> 3:11:53.440\n which I think is ridiculous.\n\n3:11:53.440 --> 3:11:55.700\n So, you know, some guy on the internet\n\n3:11:55.700 --> 3:11:57.520\n said something mean to somebody,\n\n3:11:57.520 --> 3:11:59.440\n and then this is very common,\n\n3:11:59.440 --> 3:12:03.480\n and I always try and not get involved in these things.\n\n3:12:03.480 --> 3:12:05.520\n So some guy who identifies as a Bitcoiner\n\n3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:08.360\n says something to somebody that's very wrong.\n\n3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:09.520\n Of course it happens.\n\n3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:13.440\n Tens of millions of people use Bitcoin around the world,\n\n3:12:13.440 --> 3:12:16.680\n and a lot of these, I'd say parasites,\n\n3:12:16.680 --> 3:12:18.280\n people who don't have anything productive\n\n3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:21.600\n to do with their life, you know, outrage merchants,\n\n3:12:21.600 --> 3:12:24.080\n they'll come out and say something along the lines of,\n\n3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:27.880\n you know, the Bitcoin maximalists are toxic,\n\n3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:30.360\n they're holding Bitcoin back, and they need,\n\n3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:31.440\n and of course it's manipulative.\n\n3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:34.440\n The point behind it is they want to get to you,\n\n3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:36.280\n they want to get people who are, you know,\n\n3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:38.240\n not that nobody with 300 followers\n\n3:12:38.240 --> 3:12:40.360\n who said something silly,\n\n3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:42.800\n they want to get the notable people\n\n3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:44.600\n to basically change their message.\n\n3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:47.680\n So the idea is, you know, I'm supposed to apologize\n\n3:12:47.680 --> 3:12:49.160\n because somebody with 300 followers\n\n3:12:49.160 --> 3:12:52.520\n I've never met in my life who calls themselves a Bitcoiner\n\n3:12:52.520 --> 3:12:55.080\n said a mean word, and then I need to apologize,\n\n3:12:55.080 --> 3:12:57.160\n and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric\n\n3:12:57.160 --> 3:13:00.500\n about other digital currencies, and I need to do that.\n\n3:13:00.500 --> 3:13:03.600\n So I'm only responsible for my own actions,\n\n3:13:03.600 --> 3:13:07.040\n and I don't recall regretting anything.\n\n3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:08.560\n Okay, but let me push back\n\n3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:10.240\n or push further into that direction.\n\n3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:11.880\n Fine, let's leave community aside.\n\n3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:14.320\n Labels suck, for sure.\n\n3:13:14.320 --> 3:13:19.320\n But you have a spicy way about you on Twitter.\n\n3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:21.600\n Even in this conversation, you know,\n\n3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:25.960\n you had some good, strong words to say about movement.\n\n3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:29.460\n I've always believed life is too short to mince words.\n\n3:13:29.460 --> 3:13:32.720\n One day I'm gonna be dead, and on my deathbed\n\n3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:35.140\n I'm not gonna look back and say,\n\n3:13:35.140 --> 3:13:38.000\n I wish I was a little bit more circumspect\n\n3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:39.160\n in expressing my opinions.\n\n3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:40.900\n I'm far more likely to think, you know what,\n\n3:13:40.900 --> 3:13:43.400\n I wish I said what I really think.\n\n3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:47.560\n Yes, life is too short to hold back your opinion.\n\n3:13:47.560 --> 3:13:50.480\n The question is, what is really your opinion?\n\n3:13:50.480 --> 3:13:55.320\n Because you're many people in one.\n\n3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:56.760\n So there's a person that loves,\n\n3:13:56.760 --> 3:13:58.360\n there's kindness for the human beings,\n\n3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:00.120\n there's a person that gets annoyed,\n\n3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:03.200\n there's a person that enjoys disagreement,\n\n3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:05.720\n there's a person that enjoys collaboration.\n\n3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:07.900\n And you can emphasize all of those different things,\n\n3:14:07.900 --> 3:14:09.360\n each of those different things,\n\n3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:12.240\n weigh it differently in your online interaction.\n\n3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:15.120\n There's some aspects of online interaction\n\n3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:18.080\n that encourages, in different communities,\n\n3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:20.560\n online interaction is one community\n\n3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:24.520\n that encourages kind of derision and mockery and so on.\n\n3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:26.800\n So you can choose if you want to engage\n\n3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:29.280\n that part of yourself or some other part of yourself.\n\n3:14:29.280 --> 3:14:33.360\n Economics is another community that enjoys\n\n3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:36.520\n being like very straightforward\n\n3:14:36.520 --> 3:14:38.980\n about their disagreements, pretty harsh.\n\n3:14:38.980 --> 3:14:41.880\n It's fun to watch because it feels like you arrive\n\n3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:44.940\n at the truth much faster because you tear each other apart.\n\n3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:49.760\n But that's a choice, that's a deliberate choice.\n\n3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:53.700\n And I don't want to label an entire community of people\n\n3:14:53.700 --> 3:14:56.480\n by its extremes, I don't think you should do that.\n\n3:14:56.480 --> 3:14:59.160\n But there's cultural characteristics you start to notice\n\n3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:00.800\n when you go to France, it's a certain way.\n\n3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:04.160\n When you go to Britain, London is different than rural.\n\n3:15:04.160 --> 3:15:08.140\n Britain and New York is different than Iowa.\n\n3:15:08.140 --> 3:15:09.200\n You start to notice things.\n\n3:15:09.200 --> 3:15:10.600\n I mean, you don't want to generalize,\n\n3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:12.020\n there's all kinds of people everywhere,\n\n3:15:12.020 --> 3:15:15.080\n but there's a certain way of communication\n\n3:15:15.080 --> 3:15:16.780\n on crypto, Twitter in general,\n\n3:15:16.780 --> 3:15:19.280\n but also Bitcoin maximalists\n\n3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:21.920\n that I even early on received a bunch of heat.\n\n3:15:21.920 --> 3:15:24.080\n I was like, what the hell?\n\n3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:27.040\n So listen, there's definitely a difference\n\n3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:29.460\n when I go to the computer science community,\n\n3:15:29.460 --> 3:15:31.340\n the machine learning community,\n\n3:15:31.340 --> 3:15:35.020\n it's way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community.\n\n3:15:35.020 --> 3:15:39.940\n I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being,\n\n3:15:39.940 --> 3:15:42.680\n which is asking simple dumb questions.\n\n3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:44.880\n Even when I've already spent years,\n\n3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:46.280\n sometimes decades with an idea,\n\n3:15:46.280 --> 3:15:48.960\n I like asking dumb questions anyway.\n\n3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:52.000\n The crypto folks punish you for this,\n\n3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:56.400\n for curiosity, for exploration.\n\n3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:57.760\n I understand the mechanism\n\n3:15:57.760 --> 3:16:00.900\n because so many other people come into that community\n\n3:16:00.900 --> 3:16:04.240\n and they might masquerade as curious,\n\n3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:06.440\n but really they're trying to inject,\n\n3:16:06.440 --> 3:16:08.080\n they're trying to sell some kind of altcoin,\n\n3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:10.920\n there's some scheme, there's some scheme to make money.\n\n3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:12.480\n And so I understand,\n\n3:16:12.480 --> 3:16:14.920\n maybe that's just the dynamics of the community by nature.\n\n3:16:14.920 --> 3:16:18.200\n It's not like you respond appropriately\n\n3:16:18.200 --> 3:16:22.240\n to the amount of charlatans in the community.\n\n3:16:22.240 --> 3:16:25.320\n So if the fraction of charlatans is low,\n\n3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:27.960\n maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind and so on.\n\n3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.840\n And when the fraction of charlatans is high,\n\n3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:32.720\n you have to be harsher.\n\n3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:34.560\n Perhaps, perhaps.\n\n3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:37.400\n But I think also the stakes are extremely high\n\n3:16:37.400 --> 3:16:38.240\n in this situation.\n\n3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:40.320\n And I think if you don't like Bitcoiners,\n\n3:16:40.320 --> 3:16:41.800\n if you think Bitcoiners are toxic,\n\n3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:43.280\n wait till you meet fiaters.\n\n3:16:44.440 --> 3:16:49.120\n The fiat community has financed world wars and genocides\n\n3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:53.920\n and tyrants and the mass death and destruction.\n\n3:16:53.920 --> 3:16:56.560\n The fiat community, if you wanna use that term,\n\n3:16:56.560 --> 3:16:57.800\n I don't believe that you should,\n\n3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:00.960\n but I mean, fiat has destroyed the savings\n\n3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:02.480\n of pretty much anybody who's lived\n\n3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:03.880\n through the last 20th century.\n\n3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:05.760\n Pretty much anybody who's lived through the 20th century,\n\n3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:07.000\n no matter where you lived,\n\n3:17:07.000 --> 3:17:09.920\n Switzerland, US, Ethiopia, Russia,\n\n3:17:09.920 --> 3:17:12.480\n you've gone through fiat problems.\n\n3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:15.520\n You've had hyperinflation, you've had bank confiscation.\n\n3:17:15.520 --> 3:17:17.320\n There isn't a family in the world today\n\n3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:21.320\n that hasn't had its wealth destroyed over the last century.\n\n3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:24.440\n They all have a story about the inflation\n\n3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:25.840\n and the hyperinflation.\n\n3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:27.720\n And Bitcoin offers us a way out of this.\n\n3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:32.720\n And shitcoins, altcoins are essentially fiat world's\n\n3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:39.240\n last gasp attempt to try and salvage fiat,\n\n3:17:39.240 --> 3:17:41.400\n to try and salvage the idea that some people\n\n3:17:41.400 --> 3:17:43.520\n will continue to be able to print money\n\n3:17:43.520 --> 3:17:46.200\n and other people will have to use that money.\n\n3:17:46.200 --> 3:17:49.000\n You know, this is Twitter, it's a free market,\n\n3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:50.240\n it's the internet.\n\n3:17:50.240 --> 3:17:52.560\n You don't have to follow anybody, that's the thing.\n\n3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:57.440\n So what I find really objectionable about the people\n\n3:17:57.440 --> 3:18:00.440\n who are so butthurt always about Bitcoin maximalists\n\n3:18:00.440 --> 3:18:04.120\n is you don't have to click follow on people you don't like.\n\n3:18:04.120 --> 3:18:06.680\n There are 300 million Twitter accounts.\n\n3:18:06.680 --> 3:18:09.400\n And if you choose to follow the accounts\n\n3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:11.200\n that say things that annoy you\n\n3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:12.640\n and then complain about the fact\n\n3:18:12.640 --> 3:18:15.320\n that they say things that annoy you,\n\n3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:16.480\n I'm sorry, but you're an idiot\n\n3:18:16.480 --> 3:18:18.280\n that you don't know how to use Twitter.\n\n3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:20.360\n Just follow the accounts that you like.\n\n3:18:20.360 --> 3:18:24.000\n It's, you know, you don't have to be part of this.\n\n3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:25.280\n You don't have to listen to those people.\n\n3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:27.120\n You can choose, there are a lot of Bitcoiners\n\n3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:28.200\n that don't act like this.\n\n3:18:28.200 --> 3:18:30.360\n You can just unfollow the ones that you don't like.\n\n3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:33.800\n Since in the past year, man, time flies.\n\n3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:36.320\n I've met a lot of them and I enjoy them a lot.\n\n3:18:36.320 --> 3:18:38.400\n And you build that community of people that you enjoy.\n\n3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:40.680\n There are less that communicate in the way you enjoy.\n\n3:18:40.680 --> 3:18:42.600\n And it's becoming me at this point\n\n3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:44.760\n that I block with love, I think.\n\n3:18:44.760 --> 3:18:45.600\n Yes.\n\n3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:47.080\n Because I did not.\n\n3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:48.600\n I block very prolifically\n\n3:18:48.600 --> 3:18:51.160\n and I strongly recommend people continue to block.\n\n3:18:51.160 --> 3:18:52.480\n I think Twitter is, you know,\n\n3:18:52.480 --> 3:18:53.760\n you're not gonna get to interact\n\n3:18:53.760 --> 3:18:55.440\n with 300 million accounts anyway.\n\n3:18:55.440 --> 3:18:58.480\n So you wanna be constantly curating the experience\n\n3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:00.440\n by getting rid of people you don't like\n\n3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:02.360\n and following people that you like.\n\n3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:03.880\n And that's just how, you know,\n\n3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:05.440\n after 10 years of using Twitter,\n\n3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:08.040\n you know, you get, you accumulate the block list,\n\n3:19:08.040 --> 3:19:09.840\n which is very big, which I'm very happy for.\n\n3:19:09.840 --> 3:19:11.480\n I'm gonna pass on to my children.\n\n3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:15.760\n That's, on your deathbed,\n\n3:19:15.760 --> 3:19:17.640\n the grandchildren will gather around\n\n3:19:17.640 --> 3:19:22.560\n and your grandfather can finally share the full list.\n\n3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:23.400\n Yeah.\n\n3:19:23.400 --> 3:19:25.320\n So like, again, it's just a Twitter account.\n\n3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:28.640\n If it bothers you so much, ask yourself why it bothers you\n\n3:19:28.640 --> 3:19:29.920\n that some people are so,\n\n3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:31.640\n I'm not referring to you obviously,\n\n3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:34.280\n but I mean, the people that are constantly aggravated\n\n3:19:34.280 --> 3:19:36.560\n about this, I don't get bothered by anything on Twitter.\n\n3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:38.240\n I just block immediately.\n\n3:19:38.240 --> 3:19:40.960\n And I get to curate the experience that I enjoy.\n\n3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:43.240\n And I recommend people do that.\n\n3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:46.280\n It's really a lot less pathetic than complaining\n\n3:19:46.280 --> 3:19:48.000\n about strangers saying things you don't like,\n\n3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:51.480\n which a lot of, and of course the reason for it is,\n\n3:19:51.480 --> 3:19:53.960\n you know, I mean, when I say it's stupid,\n\n3:19:53.960 --> 3:19:55.000\n it's not really stupid.\n\n3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:56.320\n There's an ulterior motive there.\n\n3:19:56.320 --> 3:19:58.000\n And the ulterior motive is,\n\n3:19:58.000 --> 3:19:59.840\n hey, I have this shit coin that I made\n\n3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:01.640\n with five other friends of mine.\n\n3:20:01.640 --> 3:20:02.920\n And I'd like you to,\n\n3:20:02.920 --> 3:20:05.280\n I'd like to ride your coattails, Bitcoiners,\n\n3:20:05.280 --> 3:20:07.480\n and I'd like you to please help me promote this shit coin.\n\n3:20:07.480 --> 3:20:10.280\n Like this is, I get this practically every week,\n\n3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:12.520\n whether through email or through Twitter,\n\n3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:14.920\n where, hey, you know, this is our shit coin.\n\n3:20:15.880 --> 3:20:17.440\n You know, it's just like Bitcoin,\n\n3:20:17.440 --> 3:20:19.520\n but it's better because it does this and this and that.\n\n3:20:19.520 --> 3:20:22.520\n And, you know, basically how can we get you\n\n3:20:22.520 --> 3:20:24.600\n to promote this shit coin for us?\n\n3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:27.360\n And being straightforward and forthright\n\n3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:29.800\n is a great productivity hack,\n\n3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:32.200\n because, you know, you just tell those people,\n\n3:20:32.200 --> 3:20:33.200\n no, I'm not interested.\n\n3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:34.040\n It's a stupid shit coin.\n\n3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:36.160\n And I wish you quick and swift failure\n\n3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:38.640\n before you take a lot of people's money.\n\n3:20:39.640 --> 3:20:41.760\n And that's what I genuinely think.\n\n3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:44.240\n Well, but I'll just be upfront with the fact,\n\n3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:45.600\n at least for my taste,\n\n3:20:45.600 --> 3:20:50.600\n just labeling everything as a shit coin worries me.\n\n3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:52.120\n So this is my own preference.\n\n3:20:52.120 --> 3:20:53.400\n It's not a judgment on you.\n\n3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:54.840\n It's just my own preference\n\n3:20:54.840 --> 3:20:57.840\n that I'm afraid I'll miss good ideas.\n\n3:20:57.840 --> 3:20:59.440\n I think when you're, me personally,\n\n3:20:59.440 --> 3:21:01.600\n when I'm too certain about things,\n\n3:21:01.600 --> 3:21:03.800\n when I'm too tribal about things,\n\n3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:06.640\n I'll miss actually really strong ideas,\n\n3:21:06.640 --> 3:21:09.360\n outlier ideas, totally new ideas.\n\n3:21:09.360 --> 3:21:10.880\n So that worries me.\n\n3:21:10.880 --> 3:21:15.880\n One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is,\n\n3:21:16.120 --> 3:21:18.560\n how much shit is at stake financially\n\n3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:20.480\n is that it's less open to good,\n\n3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:23.560\n and actually by design, that it's not changing,\n\n3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:25.440\n like with the hard forks and so on,\n\n3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:28.040\n that there's not a kind of curiosity\n\n3:21:28.040 --> 3:21:29.880\n about exploration of ideas.\n\n3:21:30.920 --> 3:21:33.120\n Of course, in some way,\n\n3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:35.640\n that curiosity can start getting injected\n\n3:21:35.640 --> 3:21:37.480\n when you start talking about other layers\n\n3:21:37.480 --> 3:21:39.360\n built on top of Bitcoin,\n\n3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:40.920\n when you start talking about applications\n\n3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:43.320\n or different things like lightning network,\n\n3:21:43.320 --> 3:21:45.520\n that's where the curiosity can emerge.\n\n3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:48.080\n But still, that's why with cryptocurrency in general,\n\n3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:49.440\n I just try to keep an open mind.\n\n3:21:49.440 --> 3:21:52.440\n And just the shit coin as a term\n\n3:21:52.440 --> 3:21:53.520\n is just a good statement\n\n3:21:53.520 --> 3:21:54.920\n that I'm gonna close my mind to.\n\n3:21:54.920 --> 3:21:56.160\n That's the way I hear it.\n\n3:21:57.560 --> 3:21:59.360\n But coming out of your mouth,\n\n3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:01.080\n because you say a lot of other edgy stuff,\n\n3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:02.960\n it's just more you having fun.\n\n3:22:02.960 --> 3:22:03.800\n That's the way I hear it.\n\n3:22:03.800 --> 3:22:05.320\n But if I said something like that,\n\n3:22:05.320 --> 3:22:08.440\n I would feel like I'm closing my mind.\n\n3:22:08.440 --> 3:22:10.640\n I mean, let me give you the counter argument to that.\n\n3:22:10.640 --> 3:22:13.080\n How much time do you spend emailing back\n\n3:22:13.080 --> 3:22:15.520\n all of these Nigerian Prince email scams\n\n3:22:15.520 --> 3:22:16.760\n that you know email you tell you,\n\n3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:19.880\n send me $5,000 and I'll send you $15 million?\n\n3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:21.280\n None. None.\n\n3:22:21.280 --> 3:22:22.840\n Why are you being close minded\n\n3:22:22.840 --> 3:22:23.920\n to all of these great ideas?\n\n3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:25.920\n Well, no, but I'm also...\n\n3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:26.840\n You know, maybe one of them\n\n3:22:26.840 --> 3:22:28.440\n will actually send you $15 million.\n\n3:22:28.440 --> 3:22:29.880\n But I don't know if I know the difference\n\n3:22:29.880 --> 3:22:32.040\n between the Nigerian Prince\n\n3:22:32.040 --> 3:22:34.160\n and many other people I do talk to\n\n3:22:34.160 --> 3:22:35.680\n who are colleagues and so on\n\n3:22:35.680 --> 3:22:37.400\n that are also emailing me.\n\n3:22:37.400 --> 3:22:39.840\n And they're also offering me things,\n\n3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:42.360\n but they don't sound as ridiculously spammy.\n\n3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:44.120\n Yeah, but I mean, the moment that somebody tells you,\n\n3:22:44.120 --> 3:22:46.520\n hey, I'm gonna give you $15 million for nothing,\n\n3:22:46.520 --> 3:22:48.520\n just if you send me $5,000,\n\n3:22:48.520 --> 3:22:49.960\n you know, you're getting something for nothing.\n\n3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:53.080\n And essentially, with all of the digital currencies,\n\n3:22:53.080 --> 3:22:53.920\n it's the same pitch.\n\n3:22:53.920 --> 3:22:56.520\n Say, hey, you know, come use this thing\n\n3:22:56.520 --> 3:22:58.240\n that'll allow you to do things that...\n\n3:22:58.240 --> 3:23:00.400\n All of the things that they pretend that they can do\n\n3:23:00.400 --> 3:23:01.880\n that can be done with computers\n\n3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:03.280\n without having digital currencies.\n\n3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:06.440\n You know, we already have AWS that does cloud computing,\n\n3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:09.600\n that does everything that shitcoins pretend to do.\n\n3:23:09.600 --> 3:23:11.360\n The only difference is AWS doesn't have\n\n3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:13.440\n its own monetary system tacked on top of it\n\n3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:17.520\n to allow Jeff Bezos to basically print his own money.\n\n3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:19.560\n But don't you think there's some gray area?\n\n3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:22.160\n So let me go for the historical record\n\n3:23:22.160 --> 3:23:23.600\n and let's see if you've changed\n\n3:23:23.600 --> 3:23:27.720\n as a philosopher, economist, human being.\n\n3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:29.640\n You tweeted three years ago.\n\n3:23:29.640 --> 3:23:30.760\n Oh, well.\n\n3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:33.040\n Anyone who believes proof of stake in work\n\n3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:35.840\n is either one completely clueless\n\n3:23:35.840 --> 3:23:38.120\n at how and why Bitcoin works at all\n\n3:23:38.120 --> 3:23:41.600\n or two, a con artist using it as a buzzword\n\n3:23:41.600 --> 3:23:44.720\n to promote a worthless scam like Ethereum.\n\n3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:49.720\n Do you still believe that Ethereum is a scam\n\n3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:51.680\n and in general, proof of stake?\n\n3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:55.280\n You're either clueless if you think it's interesting.\n\n3:23:55.280 --> 3:23:57.320\n Yeah, no, I still stand by that.\n\n3:23:57.320 --> 3:23:58.160\n I think the...\n\n3:23:58.160 --> 3:24:00.240\n Would you classify Ethereum as a shitcoin?\n\n3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:01.080\n For sure.\n\n3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:05.520\n It's the mother asshole from which the shitcoins spring.\n\n3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:07.200\n The royal, the king shitcoin.\n\n3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:08.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:24:08.040 --> 3:24:09.920\n I think the key thing is,\n\n3:24:09.920 --> 3:24:11.400\n the way to think about there's another tweet\n\n3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:12.360\n from a couple of years ago,\n\n3:24:12.360 --> 3:24:14.600\n which is essentially proof of work\n\n3:24:14.600 --> 3:24:16.320\n was like the invention of flight.\n\n3:24:16.320 --> 3:24:17.400\n Like we've gotten this machine\n\n3:24:17.400 --> 3:24:19.920\n and we managed to get it to fly off the ground.\n\n3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:21.440\n And proof of stake is,\n\n3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:25.320\n hey, we found a great way to make airplanes cheaper\n\n3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:27.920\n and faster by not making them fly.\n\n3:24:30.040 --> 3:24:31.640\n By keeping them on the ground.\n\n3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:34.040\n Like the invention of proof of work,\n\n3:24:34.040 --> 3:24:38.080\n the reason the entire digital currency space exists\n\n3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:40.880\n is because Bitcoin operates based on proof of work.\n\n3:24:40.880 --> 3:24:43.040\n If Bitcoin was based on proof of stake,\n\n3:24:43.040 --> 3:24:45.680\n it would have died or been shut down from day one.\n\n3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:49.280\n But that's a hypothesis and a lot of people believe that\n\n3:24:49.280 --> 3:24:51.360\n and I think they have a lot of strong support.\n\n3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:55.960\n But basically, proof of work is grounded in physics\n\n3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:56.880\n in the real world.\n\n3:24:56.880 --> 3:24:58.960\n The proof of stake is more about...\n\n3:24:58.960 --> 3:24:59.800\n It's politics.\n\n3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:00.880\n It's the Federal Reserve.\n\n3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:02.280\n It's exactly what we have.\n\n3:25:02.280 --> 3:25:03.520\n It's exactly what we have.\n\n3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:06.920\n It's just a group of people who get to decide the rules.\n\n3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:09.800\n And it's essentially a system that is,\n\n3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:11.120\n it's a security, it's a company.\n\n3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:13.680\n So it's not an innovation in any sense.\n\n3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:16.000\n It's a step backwards to what we already had,\n\n3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:18.640\n which is you get a bunch of people in charge of the money.\n\n3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:22.680\n Now, the only reason it survives in this,\n\n3:25:22.680 --> 3:25:24.440\n the reason I call these things scam\n\n3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:25.880\n and I have no problem with calling them a scam\n\n3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:29.520\n is because they fraudulently present themselves\n\n3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:31.120\n as being decentralized.\n\n3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:33.240\n They present themselves as just being a different way\n\n3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:36.600\n of doing decentralization than Bitcoin, when it's not.\n\n3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:39.160\n It's just they're writing Bitcoin's coattails\n\n3:25:39.160 --> 3:25:40.920\n and they're writing the fact that most people\n\n3:25:40.920 --> 3:25:43.480\n don't quite understand what Bitcoin is and how it works\n\n3:25:43.480 --> 3:25:45.600\n to portray themselves as a cheaper, better,\n\n3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:48.400\n more efficient way of doing what Bitcoin does.\n\n3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:49.320\n It's not.\n\n3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:52.680\n It's a less legally accountable way\n\n3:25:52.680 --> 3:25:54.920\n of doing what central banks do.\n\n3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:56.920\n Right, so and the basic criticism is that\n\n3:25:56.920 --> 3:25:58.120\n there's a group of people,\n\n3:25:58.120 --> 3:25:59.720\n sometimes a very small group of people\n\n3:25:59.720 --> 3:26:01.800\n that can control the parameters\n\n3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:03.360\n of the operation of the system.\n\n3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:06.840\n So over time, you can't trust,\n\n3:26:06.840 --> 3:26:09.120\n it's not gold under the mattress.\n\n3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:10.600\n It doesn't have that kind of heart.\n\n3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:11.440\n It's not property.\n\n3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:14.000\n And I really very strongly recommend your discussion\n\n3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:16.480\n with Saylor for people who want to elaborate more on this.\n\n3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:17.800\n There's a bunch of people in charge,\n\n3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:20.160\n which means that legally,\n\n3:26:20.160 --> 3:26:23.040\n they should be doing this under securities law.\n\n3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:24.480\n But even as an anarchist,\n\n3:26:24.480 --> 3:26:26.320\n if I don't want to care about that,\n\n3:26:26.320 --> 3:26:28.640\n the technical implication of it is,\n\n3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:30.200\n this is never going to be adopted\n\n3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:33.080\n as a neutral way of transferring value on the internet\n\n3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:35.440\n because you need something\n\n3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:37.440\n that enemies can trade with one another.\n\n3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:38.440\n You can't have something\n\n3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:40.360\n that has a small group of people in charge\n\n3:26:40.360 --> 3:26:43.000\n because A, this small group of people themselves\n\n3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:47.200\n can be corrupted and B, they can be coerced.\n\n3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:49.120\n You can put a bunch of people in a room,\n\n3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:50.120\n put a gun to their head,\n\n3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:52.560\n and you can change everything\n\n3:26:52.560 --> 3:26:53.960\n in any of these digital currencies.\n\n3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:58.240\n And that's why I think you'll find a lot more sympathy\n\n3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:01.480\n among fiaters to shitcoins.\n\n3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:05.560\n The Keynesian economist to Ethereum fanboy pipeline\n\n3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:09.920\n is a very strong one because it's the same thing.\n\n3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:11.400\n It's like you like the idea\n\n3:27:11.400 --> 3:27:13.080\n of people being in charge of money\n\n3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:14.440\n and you think you're going to be the one\n\n3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:15.600\n who's going to be in charge of money.\n\n3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:18.080\n So you see a lot of this phenomenon\n\n3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:20.480\n and you see the same people that want gold\n\n3:27:20.480 --> 3:27:23.680\n and don't like central banking, they get into Bitcoin.\n\n3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:27.520\n Yeah, so just to actually push back on a couple of things.\n\n3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:29.800\n So one is theater.\n\n3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:32.800\n It sounds like I'm trying to be a sophisticated Brit\n\n3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:34.200\n talking about theater,\n\n3:27:34.200 --> 3:27:38.800\n but for many reasons not making me feel good about that.\n\n3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:42.040\n So day by day, things change.\n\n3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:44.600\n You used to be one of those.\n\n3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:46.760\n So people evolve, people learn.\n\n3:27:46.760 --> 3:27:48.160\n People that are supporters of Bitcoin\n\n3:27:48.160 --> 3:27:51.920\n might eventually become supporters of Ethereum\n\n3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:53.600\n or go back to supporting fiat.\n\n3:27:53.600 --> 3:27:54.440\n We don't know.\n\n3:27:54.440 --> 3:27:56.440\n People evolve for different reasons.\n\n3:27:56.440 --> 3:28:00.520\n You grow up, you mature, or you become enlightened.\n\n3:28:00.520 --> 3:28:03.840\n So I think every single person sort of,\n\n3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:07.560\n as this technology is evolving, as this world is evolving,\n\n3:28:07.560 --> 3:28:10.280\n as wars break on, as your politics change,\n\n3:28:10.280 --> 3:28:14.160\n as the monetary system is constantly put under stress,\n\n3:28:14.160 --> 3:28:15.080\n people will evolve.\n\n3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:17.400\n So we're trying to all figure it out together.\n\n3:28:17.400 --> 3:28:19.080\n That's why like open mindedness here,\n\n3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:23.120\n I think for people like me at least seems essential.\n\n3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:25.440\n I know, so I expect you to be answering\n\n3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:27.600\n all of the spam emails you get.\n\n3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:29.640\n I will, prince by prince by prince.\n\n3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:32.880\n But no, I don't have a clear understanding\n\n3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:34.200\n what is a good investment in my time,\n\n3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:36.000\n what is a good investment in my money.\n\n3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:38.860\n That doesn't seem clear because things,\n\n3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:42.120\n things are good at promoting themselves.\n\n3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:45.300\n I'm not talking about the different kinds of things\n\n3:28:45.300 --> 3:28:47.360\n like Ethereum, altcoins, and so on.\n\n3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:52.360\n I just mean life, like dating, jobs, friendships.\n\n3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:56.900\n Like everybody's advertising themselves\n\n3:28:56.900 --> 3:28:59.340\n as a great investment, right?\n\n3:28:59.340 --> 3:29:02.040\n But you don't know and you have to keep an open mind.\n\n3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:06.860\n And also I don't, and be sort of self introspective\n\n3:29:06.860 --> 3:29:11.860\n about what, how like biases I operate under\n\n3:29:12.260 --> 3:29:14.860\n and ways I delude myself,\n\n3:29:14.860 --> 3:29:16.800\n like hallucinations that I'm living under.\n\n3:29:16.800 --> 3:29:19.880\n It's like breaking out of all these hallucinations.\n\n3:29:19.880 --> 3:29:22.900\n It's very hard to introspect thinking like\n\n3:29:22.900 --> 3:29:25.900\n what are the assumptions under which I live my entire life\n\n3:29:25.900 --> 3:29:27.900\n that might be actually false assumptions.\n\n3:29:27.900 --> 3:29:31.060\n That's a really difficult thought process to take.\n\n3:29:31.060 --> 3:29:32.500\n It's a dangerous one.\n\n3:29:32.500 --> 3:29:35.300\n It's the nature if you gaze long into the abyss,\n\n3:29:35.300 --> 3:29:37.260\n the abyss gaze into you.\n\n3:29:37.260 --> 3:29:40.060\n It's like Alex Jones talks about this.\n\n3:29:40.060 --> 3:29:43.660\n I mean he's living, he's got demons in his head.\n\n3:29:43.660 --> 3:29:45.780\n So he has like all these conspiracy theories\n\n3:29:45.780 --> 3:29:46.700\n that it holds in his head\n\n3:29:46.700 --> 3:29:48.820\n but it begins to really destroy him.\n\n3:29:48.820 --> 3:29:51.140\n So it's a psychological burden to carry.\n\n3:29:51.140 --> 3:29:53.420\n So if you question, if you question authority,\n\n3:29:53.420 --> 3:29:55.940\n if you question government, if you question culture,\n\n3:29:55.940 --> 3:29:58.540\n the way things have been done, it's really difficult.\n\n3:29:59.880 --> 3:30:02.340\n And the biases you operate under,\n\n3:30:02.340 --> 3:30:03.740\n it's really difficult to question them.\n\n3:30:03.740 --> 3:30:07.620\n So I think like being constantly open minded\n\n3:30:07.620 --> 3:30:10.060\n and self critical, not constantly,\n\n3:30:10.060 --> 3:30:12.780\n but a little bit every day is important I think.\n\n3:30:12.780 --> 3:30:15.180\n Yeah, but I mean, you know, you're talking to somebody,\n\n3:30:15.180 --> 3:30:18.700\n I grew up in Ramallah in Palestine in the West Bank.\n\n3:30:18.700 --> 3:30:22.260\n I've changed my mind on all kinds of different things.\n\n3:30:22.260 --> 3:30:25.260\n The fact that I was even open to the idea of Bitcoin\n\n3:30:25.260 --> 3:30:29.180\n is required, has required an enormous, enormous amount of,\n\n3:30:29.180 --> 3:30:30.180\n it's a heck of a journey.\n\n3:30:30.180 --> 3:30:34.740\n So I'd much rather appreciate, you know, direct arguments\n\n3:30:34.740 --> 3:30:37.580\n rather than these kinds of general fluffy,\n\n3:30:37.580 --> 3:30:39.140\n you know, you should be, oh, of course, yes,\n\n3:30:39.140 --> 3:30:40.060\n you should be open minded,\n\n3:30:40.060 --> 3:30:42.620\n but you know, also you come up with conclusions\n\n3:30:42.620 --> 3:30:44.260\n and you delete spam email sometimes\n\n3:30:44.260 --> 3:30:45.380\n when you know that it is spam\n\n3:30:45.380 --> 3:30:46.740\n because you have to move on with your life.\n\n3:30:46.740 --> 3:30:48.380\n You can't, there's an opportunity cost\n\n3:30:48.380 --> 3:30:50.140\n to considering every spam email, so.\n\n3:30:50.140 --> 3:30:52.340\n Well, to me, okay, so I'll just say\n\n3:30:52.340 --> 3:30:56.980\n from my relatively sort of shallow perspective,\n\n3:30:56.980 --> 3:30:59.300\n almost like a technical person, mostly,\n\n3:30:59.300 --> 3:31:01.280\n my understanding of economics is weak.\n\n3:31:02.700 --> 3:31:05.100\n Proof of stake is not obviously\n\n3:31:07.620 --> 3:31:10.960\n a weak consensus mechanism relative to proof of work.\n\n3:31:10.960 --> 3:31:14.880\n So that's not obvious to me that that goes wrong\n\n3:31:14.880 --> 3:31:16.440\n and becomes corrupted in the way\n\n3:31:16.440 --> 3:31:18.160\n that governments get corrupted\n\n3:31:18.160 --> 3:31:21.680\n because it still seems decentralized.\n\n3:31:21.680 --> 3:31:24.800\n Now, your criticism of governance is an interesting one,\n\n3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:26.680\n but if you put that aside,\n\n3:31:26.680 --> 3:31:29.280\n it still is a decentralized mechanism\n\n3:31:29.280 --> 3:31:32.680\n and it's more transparent than the mechanism\n\n3:31:32.680 --> 3:31:33.800\n that governments operate on.\n\n3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:35.800\n It isn't, it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is.\n\n3:31:35.800 --> 3:31:37.680\n The Federal Reserve is a proof of stake system.\n\n3:31:37.680 --> 3:31:40.680\n The Federal Reserve is owned by its constituent banks\n\n3:31:40.680 --> 3:31:42.400\n and so the rules of the Federal Reserve\n\n3:31:42.400 --> 3:31:44.800\n and the regulations are determined by the ownership,\n\n3:31:44.800 --> 3:31:45.640\n which is the banks.\n\n3:31:45.640 --> 3:31:47.800\n So it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is.\n\n3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:50.520\n But it's too backdoor, the agreements\n\n3:31:50.520 --> 3:31:53.760\n between the banks and the Federal Reserve.\n\n3:31:53.760 --> 3:31:55.100\n It feels like a lot of those agreements\n\n3:31:55.100 --> 3:31:58.760\n are made between individuals that sort of behind the scenes.\n\n3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:01.160\n It's not hard to, it's opaque.\n\n3:32:01.160 --> 3:32:03.560\n Yes, but the only way that a proof of stake system\n\n3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:05.560\n will take off is if you have a military\n\n3:32:05.560 --> 3:32:07.280\n to force people to use it.\n\n3:32:07.280 --> 3:32:08.120\n That's the thing.\n\n3:32:08.120 --> 3:32:10.360\n Ultimately, there's no way that it's going to take off\n\n3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:11.760\n on a free market.\n\n3:32:11.760 --> 3:32:14.040\n And that's why for all of the bluster\n\n3:32:14.040 --> 3:32:16.280\n about wanting to move to a proof of stake system,\n\n3:32:16.280 --> 3:32:19.080\n Ethereum have been saying this since 2014.\n\n3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:22.860\n It's now been eight years that they've been talking about it.\n\n3:32:22.860 --> 3:32:25.420\n We still haven't seen the proof of stake system\n\n3:32:25.420 --> 3:32:26.440\n operational in the wild.\n\n3:32:26.440 --> 3:32:28.400\n It's vaporware for all practical and intentional.\n\n3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:30.020\n Oh, Cardano's proof of stake.\n\n3:32:30.020 --> 3:32:31.600\n It's potential.\n\n3:32:31.600 --> 3:32:33.600\n I mean, you can do it in a centralized way,\n\n3:32:33.600 --> 3:32:36.760\n but can it survive?\n\n3:32:36.760 --> 3:32:38.840\n Can it last for a long time?\n\n3:32:38.840 --> 3:32:39.660\n I don't think so.\n\n3:32:39.660 --> 3:32:44.280\n I think it can last perhaps initially with marketing,\n\n3:32:44.280 --> 3:32:46.280\n with centralized marketing, you can promote it.\n\n3:32:46.280 --> 3:32:50.520\n But ultimately, user demand,\n\n3:32:50.520 --> 3:32:53.160\n the people that are not interested in speculating\n\n3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:54.440\n because they want to get rich on this,\n\n3:32:54.440 --> 3:32:55.820\n the people that are going to use it,\n\n3:32:55.820 --> 3:32:58.280\n they're going to want to use it because they can trust\n\n3:32:58.280 --> 3:33:00.800\n that it is not going to be messed with.\n\n3:33:00.800 --> 3:33:03.280\n Yes, but there's also applications.\n\n3:33:03.280 --> 3:33:04.600\n That's also a lightning network.\n\n3:33:04.600 --> 3:33:06.360\n But there's applications on top.\n\n3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:09.720\n Well, the reason I'm interested in things like Ethereum\n\n3:33:09.720 --> 3:33:11.800\n is you might think it's ridiculous.\n\n3:33:11.800 --> 3:33:14.840\n I thought it was ridiculous, but NFTs.\n\n3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:18.160\n So you can have NFTs probably on top of Bitcoin,\n\n3:33:18.160 --> 3:33:20.440\n but you don't because there's no marketing on Bitcoin\n\n3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:22.920\n because all of these ideas get promoted\n\n3:33:22.920 --> 3:33:25.400\n on proprietary shitcoins because, yes.\n\n3:33:25.400 --> 3:33:28.760\n But there's the network effects of ideas, of applications.\n\n3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:30.440\n So they just take off for some reason.\n\n3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:33.360\n And human civilization is such that you get excited\n\n3:33:33.360 --> 3:33:35.560\n about stuff and large amounts of people believe a thing\n\n3:33:35.560 --> 3:33:38.120\n and they start to get excited and it actually has impact.\n\n3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:41.520\n Like the fact that NFTs can have an impact on the art world\n\n3:33:41.520 --> 3:33:45.360\n or the world in general is wild to me.\n\n3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:46.600\n But it worked.\n\n3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:47.800\n So the question is.\n\n3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:50.320\n David Rothcall has an impact on the art world.\n\n3:33:50.320 --> 3:33:51.960\n That doesn't say much.\n\n3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:54.080\n Well, I'm saying these ideas have,\n\n3:33:54.080 --> 3:33:56.240\n we're collective intelligent beings\n\n3:33:56.240 --> 3:33:59.840\n and we can believe a thing and that has power.\n\n3:33:59.840 --> 3:34:02.820\n That has led to major wars and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:34:02.820 --> 3:34:07.360\n So it's interesting to me that NFTs took hold.\n\n3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:09.880\n And the question is, is there distributed DApps?\n\n3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:11.480\n Is there distributed apps built on top\n\n3:34:11.480 --> 3:34:13.000\n of different blockchains\n\n3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:14.960\n that might somehow transform the world?\n\n3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:17.760\n You have to kind of keep an open mind to that.\n\n3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:19.440\n Cause right now it's like,\n\n3:34:19.440 --> 3:34:21.320\n it's like I'm the same place with that\n\n3:34:21.320 --> 3:34:23.320\n as I am with like virtual reality.\n\n3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:26.560\n It's like, all right, this seems like a really\n\n3:34:26.560 --> 3:34:29.880\n intellectually promising set of ideas here,\n\n3:34:29.880 --> 3:34:31.600\n but there's something either technically\n\n3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:33.920\n or socially not quite taking hold.\n\n3:34:33.920 --> 3:34:35.520\n Why?\n\n3:34:35.520 --> 3:34:37.440\n And I don't know what the right answer is.\n\n3:34:37.440 --> 3:34:39.820\n So with virtual reality, what's the right answer?\n\n3:34:39.820 --> 3:34:43.940\n Is it just technically the latency is too high\n\n3:34:43.940 --> 3:34:46.560\n or the games are not good enough?\n\n3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:48.560\n Or is it a fundamentally flawed idea\n\n3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:51.240\n that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it?\n\n3:34:51.240 --> 3:34:54.320\n That the physical world is just orders of magnitude better?\n\n3:34:54.320 --> 3:34:57.720\n Or a two dimensional display is just as good\n\n3:34:57.720 --> 3:34:59.160\n as a three dimensional world?\n\n3:34:59.160 --> 3:35:00.000\n I don't know.\n\n3:35:00.000 --> 3:35:01.240\n Why is virtual reality not taking off?\n\n3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:03.280\n It's been since the 80s, right?\n\n3:35:03.280 --> 3:35:05.120\n I don't have strong opinions on it,\n\n3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:07.720\n on the prospect of the technology.\n\n3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:10.600\n Personally, I don't want to ever imagine myself\n\n3:35:10.600 --> 3:35:12.200\n having something on my eyes.\n\n3:35:12.200 --> 3:35:15.200\n I'd rather just go out into the real world.\n\n3:35:15.200 --> 3:35:17.760\n But I don't have strong opinions on virtual reality.\n\n3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:20.000\n I do have on dApps and NFTs.\n\n3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:22.640\n Yeah, what's your criticism of dApps and NFTs?\n\n3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:23.720\n Is this a distraction?\n\n3:35:23.720 --> 3:35:27.740\n It's a way to sell a flawed technology?\n\n3:35:27.740 --> 3:35:29.600\n The problem with dApps is, I mean,\n\n3:35:29.600 --> 3:35:31.880\n it's just the economics of it makes no sense\n\n3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:34.280\n in the sense that currently,\n\n3:35:35.840 --> 3:35:37.880\n if you wanted to run an application,\n\n3:35:37.880 --> 3:35:40.000\n whatever the application is,\n\n3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:41.720\n you want to run it on AWS,\n\n3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:43.080\n you pay a specific amount of money,\n\n3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:44.860\n you want to run it on your own laptop,\n\n3:35:44.860 --> 3:35:48.320\n you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data.\n\n3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:50.960\n If you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger,\n\n3:35:50.960 --> 3:35:52.280\n where you're distributing the data\n\n3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:54.760\n over thousands of computers worldwide,\n\n3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:56.560\n it's infinitely more expensive.\n\n3:35:56.560 --> 3:36:00.600\n And that's why we haven't seen any of these dApps take off.\n\n3:36:00.600 --> 3:36:03.320\n And that's why I've said this many years ago,\n\n3:36:03.320 --> 3:36:04.880\n the only working application\n\n3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:07.080\n of blockchain technology is Bitcoin.\n\n3:36:07.080 --> 3:36:09.280\n Because with Bitcoin, you know,\n\n3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:11.360\n with a few hundred bytes of data,\n\n3:36:11.360 --> 3:36:12.440\n with a few bytes of data,\n\n3:36:12.440 --> 3:36:17.440\n you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value\n\n3:36:17.740 --> 3:36:21.360\n from here to China and move it safely and reliably.\n\n3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:24.200\n So that power,\n\n3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:27.360\n I can't see it being justified\n\n3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:29.360\n for anything that is not as mission critical,\n\n3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:32.280\n as moving large amounts of value,\n\n3:36:32.280 --> 3:36:34.980\n which require very little amount of information.\n\n3:36:34.980 --> 3:36:36.480\n So when you look at all of the buzzwords\n\n3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:40.400\n that the Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people\n\n3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:43.160\n like to use, and you know,\n\n3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:44.760\n if you want to wonder really why\n\n3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:46.840\n we come to this kind of aggression\n\n3:36:46.840 --> 3:36:48.320\n is because we've heard all of this, you know,\n\n3:36:48.320 --> 3:36:50.960\n I've had all of these hucksters come to me for years,\n\n3:36:50.960 --> 3:36:54.640\n you know, it's been, I've had, you know, people in 2016\n\n3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:59.360\n talk to me about how Ethereum blockchain technology\n\n3:36:59.360 --> 3:37:02.880\n is going to revolutionize real estate deeds in India.\n\n3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:04.100\n I remember this guy,\n\n3:37:05.320 --> 3:37:07.760\n I'm not going to mention his name,\n\n3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:09.600\n but this guy was, you know, 2016,\n\n3:37:09.600 --> 3:37:11.320\n and he sold a lot of shitcoins\n\n3:37:11.320 --> 3:37:13.440\n and he made a lot of money off of shitcoins\n\n3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:15.820\n based on all these silly ideas.\n\n3:37:15.820 --> 3:37:19.040\n We're going to have Blackjack on a distributed ledger.\n\n3:37:19.040 --> 3:37:20.400\n We're going to have Indian real estate\n\n3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:22.200\n on a distributed ledger.\n\n3:37:22.200 --> 3:37:25.080\n And it's just, it's concerned trolling marketing.\n\n3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:28.120\n You know, oh, there's a problem with real estate in India,\n\n3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:32.120\n real estate deeds, blockchain fixes this, buy my shitcoin.\n\n3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:33.920\n And then people buy the shitcoin,\n\n3:37:33.920 --> 3:37:35.760\n Indian real estate isn't fixed,\n\n3:37:35.760 --> 3:37:38.520\n and the guy gets rich and they move on.\n\n3:37:38.520 --> 3:37:42.500\n But I mean, I'm still waiting for a dap to actually emerge.\n\n3:37:42.500 --> 3:37:46.760\n Like, you know, it's, the promise that we keep hearing\n\n3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:49.560\n is something completely world changing,\n\n3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:51.000\n world transforming.\n\n3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:53.240\n And the reality is not one app.\n\n3:37:53.240 --> 3:37:56.160\n Like there's one of my good friends, Jimmy Song,\n\n3:37:56.160 --> 3:37:57.800\n eventually they refused to go ahead with the bet.\n\n3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:00.520\n He wanted to bet with one of the Ethereum people\n\n3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:02.840\n about these daps.\n\n3:38:02.840 --> 3:38:04.320\n You know, the Ethereum people are constantly saying\n\n3:38:04.320 --> 3:38:05.360\n those daps are going to grow\n\n3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:07.480\n and they're going to have so many applications\n\n3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:09.120\n and they're going to have so many ideas.\n\n3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:11.720\n And the reality is all the apps that work\n\n3:38:11.720 --> 3:38:13.080\n are centralized apps, you know?\n\n3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:16.560\n So there is no Uber on the blockchain.\n\n3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:20.400\n There is no Twitter on the blockchain.\n\n3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:21.640\n There is no social media on the blockchain\n\n3:38:21.640 --> 3:38:23.200\n because these are businesses\n\n3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:25.560\n and businesses require a centralized authority\n\n3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:26.800\n to make decisions.\n\n3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:29.160\n You can't have it be decentralized.\n\n3:38:29.160 --> 3:38:30.680\n Listen, you're frustrated,\n\n3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:33.000\n and I could see it over a few years\n\n3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:37.960\n of just having dealt with a humongous influx of charlatans.\n\n3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:39.800\n I wouldn't say frustrated, I'm amused.\n\n3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:43.480\n And it's no, it's water off my back.\n\n3:38:43.480 --> 3:38:45.080\n No, but a man that uses,\n\n3:38:45.080 --> 3:38:47.920\n and a community that uses the word shit coin\n\n3:38:47.920 --> 3:38:50.800\n is a little bit, you call it amusement.\n\n3:38:50.800 --> 3:38:52.560\n And I think amusement is a way\n\n3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:55.880\n to deal with the frustration.\n\n3:38:55.880 --> 3:38:57.680\n It's a channel and you have frustration.\n\n3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:01.680\n Like sometimes when you have to deal with bullshit,\n\n3:39:01.680 --> 3:39:04.240\n the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity of it all.\n\n3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:07.160\n And that's what you mean by amusement.\n\n3:39:07.160 --> 3:39:09.000\n But the fact is like,\n\n3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:13.240\n there's things like artificial intelligence for,\n\n3:39:13.240 --> 3:39:18.240\n what is it, how many decades, seven decades,\n\n3:39:18.400 --> 3:39:23.520\n has been off and on promising to change everything.\n\n3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:28.080\n And it has failed time and time again\n\n3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:30.320\n to deliver to the promise.\n\n3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:32.560\n But that doesn't mean there's something fundamental\n\n3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:34.720\n and really powerful about both the small\n\n3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:36.520\n and the big things going on\n\n3:39:36.520 --> 3:39:39.320\n within the actual research and development\n\n3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:40.360\n within those communities.\n\n3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:41.960\n There's a lot of exciting developments.\n\n3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:44.320\n And the scale at which those developments\n\n3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:46.680\n might actually have a transformative impact,\n\n3:39:46.680 --> 3:39:48.960\n the time scale is unclear.\n\n3:39:48.960 --> 3:39:51.760\n It seems like we're certainly overpromising.\n\n3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:54.360\n We dream too big and too aggressively\n\n3:39:54.360 --> 3:39:56.320\n in the AI community, but in a lot of communities.\n\n3:39:56.320 --> 3:39:58.440\n And I'm happy to give people the benefit of the doubt\n\n3:39:58.440 --> 3:39:59.840\n when they're overpromising,\n\n3:39:59.840 --> 3:40:01.680\n but not when they're making their own money.\n\n3:40:01.680 --> 3:40:03.640\n When you start making your own currency,\n\n3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:05.680\n then you don't get the benefit of the doubt.\n\n3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:08.440\n Because if your idea needs you to have a new currency\n\n3:40:08.440 --> 3:40:10.600\n that you print when Bitcoin is out there,\n\n3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:12.560\n then I'm gonna go ahead and assume\n\n3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:13.400\n that you're doing this for the money.\n\n3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:14.360\n It's a good time to mention\n\n3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:19.080\n that I am actually launching my new coin called LexCoin.\n\n3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:20.000\n You mean ShitCoin.\n\n3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:20.840\n Yes.\n\n3:40:20.840 --> 3:40:22.480\n Oh, God.\n\n3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:24.400\n I'm gonna have to block you with love.\n\n3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:28.200\n Okay, one thing I wanted to ask you about\n\n3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:33.200\n is the Feds, this paper they released in January 20th\n\n3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:39.160\n on the potential central bank digital currency, CBDC.\n\n3:40:39.160 --> 3:40:40.360\n What are your thoughts about that?\n\n3:40:40.360 --> 3:40:43.560\n Is it just another, like, is there pros and cons to this?\n\n3:40:43.560 --> 3:40:45.160\n Is it at all interesting to you\n\n3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:47.160\n that they're even considering this kind of thing?\n\n3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:51.760\n I used to think that it's just basically a waffle.\n\n3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:53.320\n It's meaningless.\n\n3:40:53.320 --> 3:40:55.120\n And because as it exists,\n\n3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:57.520\n the dollar is a central bank digital currency.\n\n3:40:57.520 --> 3:40:59.520\n The vast majority of dollars are digital.\n\n3:40:59.520 --> 3:41:03.280\n And, but I think the way that over the last couple of years\n\n3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:04.240\n I've changed my mind on this,\n\n3:41:04.240 --> 3:41:08.320\n I think there's some serious substance behind these ideas.\n\n3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:10.720\n And what they mean effectively\n\n3:41:10.720 --> 3:41:14.000\n is the disintermediation of the banking system\n\n3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:17.000\n and giving everybody an account at the Federal Reserve.\n\n3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:21.240\n This is kind of the really dangerous idea.\n\n3:41:21.240 --> 3:41:22.840\n And I think this is enormously significant.\n\n3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:25.800\n Effectively, as somebody who's lived in the Soviet Union,\n\n3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:27.880\n what this is, is the return of the Gosbank\n\n3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:30.720\n on a global scale with modern technology.\n\n3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:31.760\n So under the Soviet Union,\n\n3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:34.760\n there was something called the Gosbank or People's Bank.\n\n3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:36.280\n And that was the only bank in the country.\n\n3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:39.440\n And you had an account with the National Bank.\n\n3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:42.800\n And if you said something wrong,\n\n3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:45.880\n your money got terminated from the Gosbank.\n\n3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:47.440\n Now, imagine that combined\n\n3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:50.520\n with the power of digital technology.\n\n3:41:50.520 --> 3:41:52.360\n And you can see that this could be\n\n3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:56.080\n an enormously powerful technology really,\n\n3:41:56.080 --> 3:41:58.800\n because if banks are out of the picture,\n\n3:41:58.800 --> 3:42:03.160\n then we changed the fundamental reality of fiat\n\n3:42:03.160 --> 3:42:05.840\n as being the creation of money through lending.\n\n3:42:05.840 --> 3:42:08.800\n And then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat,\n\n3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:10.080\n by government fiat.\n\n3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:13.200\n So we moved to a system in which money is just basically,\n\n3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:16.560\n it's like we have money that is pieces of paper.\n\n3:42:16.560 --> 3:42:18.040\n And every time we've had money,\n\n3:42:18.040 --> 3:42:20.440\n we've had fiat money that was just pieces of paper,\n\n3:42:20.440 --> 3:42:21.920\n it collapsed very quickly.\n\n3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:25.160\n With the current system, money is credit.\n\n3:42:25.160 --> 3:42:28.240\n And the creation of credit is restricted to some point.\n\n3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:30.160\n And the creation of credit is self correcting.\n\n3:42:30.160 --> 3:42:32.040\n I discussed this in the fiat standard.\n\n3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:35.120\n If the central bank allows banks to create too much credit,\n\n3:42:35.120 --> 3:42:35.960\n that creates a bubble.\n\n3:42:35.960 --> 3:42:38.280\n And then there's a collapse in the money supply,\n\n3:42:38.280 --> 3:42:40.280\n which prevents hyperinflation from happening\n\n3:42:40.280 --> 3:42:44.160\n because the money creation is self destructive,\n\n3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:45.800\n it's self correcting.\n\n3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:49.880\n So you end up with an average of like 7% per year increase\n\n3:42:49.880 --> 3:42:52.840\n because you have 10% for five years\n\n3:42:52.840 --> 3:42:55.840\n and then you get negative 20% for one year\n\n3:42:55.840 --> 3:42:57.760\n and it's correcting.\n\n3:42:57.760 --> 3:43:00.000\n But now if you get rid of the credit creation mechanism,\n\n3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:02.240\n it's just assigning money directly,\n\n3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:04.840\n we're likely gonna get much faster inflation.\n\n3:43:04.840 --> 3:43:08.200\n And I think that's obviously the huge problem\n\n3:43:08.200 --> 3:43:10.240\n and perhaps the even bigger problem\n\n3:43:10.240 --> 3:43:12.440\n is the enormous amount of power\n\n3:43:12.440 --> 3:43:14.160\n that it gives to governments.\n\n3:43:14.160 --> 3:43:18.000\n It allows them to create an awful dystopia\n\n3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:22.520\n where you've got your money on your phone\n\n3:43:22.520 --> 3:43:27.120\n and anything you do is completely supervised\n\n3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:28.680\n and controlled through your spending.\n\n3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:31.880\n So they wanna introduce a new lockdown,\n\n3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:34.040\n then they'll just make your money not work.\n\n3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:36.920\n Your money is broken today, you can't spend money\n\n3:43:36.920 --> 3:43:39.440\n or you can only spend money in your local supermarket\n\n3:43:39.440 --> 3:43:40.360\n for the next three months\n\n3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:42.560\n because you can't leave your neighborhood,\n\n3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:45.160\n your money stops working outside of your neighborhood.\n\n3:43:45.160 --> 3:43:48.040\n This Chinese social credit score system\n\n3:43:48.040 --> 3:43:50.040\n is an example of this.\n\n3:43:50.040 --> 3:43:53.680\n And I think, I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball,\n\n3:43:53.680 --> 3:43:55.160\n so I don't know what the likelihood is\n\n3:43:55.160 --> 3:43:58.160\n of implementing something like this in the US.\n\n3:43:58.160 --> 3:43:59.920\n I've discussed it with Michael Saylor,\n\n3:43:59.920 --> 3:44:02.000\n he thinks it's highly unlikely.\n\n3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:05.280\n He thinks the people who've been pushing this\n\n3:44:05.280 --> 3:44:07.160\n are very far from the position of power\n\n3:44:07.160 --> 3:44:10.680\n and the traditional monetary and financial system\n\n3:44:10.680 --> 3:44:13.600\n is going to survive intact.\n\n3:44:13.600 --> 3:44:15.480\n I certainly hope so.\n\n3:44:15.480 --> 3:44:17.960\n I think this would be a terrible thing if it comes to pass.\n\n3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.120\n But I don't think, many people think\n\n3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:21.400\n that it is something that would undermine Bitcoin.\n\n3:44:21.400 --> 3:44:24.560\n Like a lot of common objection to Bitcoin is,\n\n3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:26.160\n well, governments are just gonna launch\n\n3:44:26.160 --> 3:44:27.600\n their own digital currencies\n\n3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:28.920\n and then Bitcoin is gonna die.\n\n3:44:28.920 --> 3:44:31.040\n And I think this is completely missing the point.\n\n3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:33.520\n People think Bitcoin is important because it's digital.\n\n3:44:33.520 --> 3:44:34.680\n It's not.\n\n3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:36.920\n National currencies can be digital.\n\n3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:39.520\n Bitcoin is important because it's not inflationary\n\n3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:41.400\n and because nobody controls it.\n\n3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:42.720\n Central bank digital currencies\n\n3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:44.840\n are likely to be very inflationary\n\n3:44:44.840 --> 3:44:47.800\n and they're likely to have very strong control at the top.\n\n3:44:47.800 --> 3:44:50.480\n So if anything, they are an advertisement for Bitcoin\n\n3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:52.720\n rather than a replacement for it.\n\n3:44:52.720 --> 3:44:54.040\n If it's Bitcoin, if it's gold,\n\n3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:56.920\n it's a way for multiple nations to partake.\n\n3:44:56.920 --> 3:44:59.560\n So if you were to imagine a future\n\n3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:03.720\n where we move from the fiat standard\n\n3:45:03.720 --> 3:45:06.760\n back to the gold standard and then to the Bitcoin standard\n\n3:45:06.760 --> 3:45:10.320\n or skipping that, going directly to the Bitcoin standard,\n\n3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:12.160\n what would it take?\n\n3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:13.920\n Is it gradual, is it immediate?\n\n3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:17.480\n What are possible trajectories that take us?\n\n3:45:17.480 --> 3:45:19.800\n Well, basically where the final sort of empirical\n\n3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:22.160\n observation is that you overtake,\n\n3:45:22.160 --> 3:45:26.600\n Bitcoin overtakes first gold and then bonds\n\n3:45:26.600 --> 3:45:31.600\n in terms of its monetary power in the world.\n\n3:45:31.760 --> 3:45:34.360\n But like just specifically from a government perspective,\n\n3:45:34.360 --> 3:45:37.160\n how do we move the United States, China, Russia,\n\n3:45:37.160 --> 3:45:42.160\n India, European Union to a Bitcoin standard?\n\n3:45:43.320 --> 3:45:45.000\n I'm not entirely concerned about\n\n3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:46.200\n whether governments move or not.\n\n3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:50.040\n In fact, I'd be very happy for them not to move\n\n3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:53.320\n as long as possible so that individuals can accumulate\n\n3:45:53.320 --> 3:45:56.400\n more and more Bitcoin while it's still cheap.\n\n3:45:56.400 --> 3:46:01.320\n So the people will move and the governments will catch up.\n\n3:46:01.320 --> 3:46:04.000\n Yeah, and I think this is kind of what I allude to.\n\n3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:05.680\n I mean, the point of the fiat standard,\n\n3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:07.880\n the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin book\n\n3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:10.080\n and it talks about fiat most of the time,\n\n3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:13.960\n but it does so to analyze Bitcoin and the rise of Bitcoin.\n\n3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:16.480\n In the final chapter, I discuss how I think\n\n3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:18.040\n this relationship plays out.\n\n3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:23.320\n The way that I tend to think of it\n\n3:46:23.320 --> 3:46:25.040\n is that most likely what's going to happen\n\n3:46:25.040 --> 3:46:28.720\n is we're gonna have kind of a financial apartheid\n\n3:46:28.720 --> 3:46:31.080\n where there's going to be two monetary systems.\n\n3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:34.520\n One is government controlled and it comes\n\n3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:37.720\n with increasing amounts of surveillance and inflation.\n\n3:46:37.720 --> 3:46:41.360\n And then if you want, you can just opt out of that\n\n3:46:41.360 --> 3:46:42.840\n and get into Bitcoin.\n\n3:46:42.840 --> 3:46:45.680\n And it's likely going to be difficult for governments\n\n3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:48.360\n to stop people from getting into Bitcoin\n\n3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:49.840\n for all of the technical reasons\n\n3:46:49.840 --> 3:46:52.280\n that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin.\n\n3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:54.120\n So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin,\n\n3:46:54.120 --> 3:46:57.960\n which is not inflationary and does not have\n\n3:46:57.960 --> 3:47:00.840\n a central authority that can censor it.\n\n3:47:00.840 --> 3:47:04.800\n I think gradually is my hope\n\n3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:07.320\n and I also think my most likely scenario,\n\n3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:10.920\n but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks\n\n3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:13.000\n what they want is what's gonna happen.\n\n3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:16.280\n I think we're just gonna witness the same relationship\n\n3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:18.800\n because governments make their currencies\n\n3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:22.560\n so that they can devalue them and Bitcoin thrives on that.\n\n3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:24.080\n And more and more people are gonna learn,\n\n3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:26.120\n more and more people are gonna find out.\n\n3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:29.840\n And whether it's through curiosity or self interest\n\n3:47:29.840 --> 3:47:32.400\n or through the destruction of the national currency,\n\n3:47:32.400 --> 3:47:34.800\n all roads lead to a Bitcoin.\n\n3:47:34.800 --> 3:47:36.480\n So more and more people are gonna buy Bitcoin,\n\n3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:38.000\n the price of Bitcoin is going to go up.\n\n3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:41.120\n And as it goes up, Bitcoin becomes a more significant part\n\n3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:42.040\n of the world economy.\n\n3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:45.360\n And this is something that the skeptics don't get.\n\n3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:48.800\n Like a lot of the academic skeptics to Bitcoin,\n\n3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:50.840\n they offer up all of these theories\n\n3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:53.520\n about why they think Bitcoin can't work\n\n3:47:53.520 --> 3:47:56.120\n and then they present it and they think,\n\n3:47:56.120 --> 3:47:58.040\n they've delivered the knockout blow\n\n3:47:58.040 --> 3:47:59.640\n as if Bitcoin needs their permission\n\n3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:01.200\n or the world is going to need their permission.\n\n3:48:01.200 --> 3:48:02.880\n Well, the reality is people are gonna join Bitcoin\n\n3:48:02.880 --> 3:48:05.000\n out of greed, out of self interest.\n\n3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.760\n Number go up technology is really\n\n3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:10.000\n what's going to get everybody in.\n\n3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:14.520\n And that's really the Trojan horse for fixing the world.\n\n3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:16.880\n Come for the greed and stay for the revolution.\n\n3:48:16.880 --> 3:48:18.640\n It's gonna keep going up\n\n3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:21.240\n because people don't like to be poor,\n\n3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:23.560\n except for most economists and academics.\n\n3:48:24.600 --> 3:48:25.760\n People don't like to be poor.\n\n3:48:25.760 --> 3:48:28.440\n People don't enjoy getting their wealth destroyed\n\n3:48:28.440 --> 3:48:30.440\n and they care more about their self interest\n\n3:48:30.440 --> 3:48:32.560\n than they care about economic theories\n\n3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:34.600\n about whether this works as money or not.\n\n3:48:34.600 --> 3:48:37.280\n They see their cousin escaped hyperinflation\n\n3:48:37.280 --> 3:48:38.520\n and managed to get a bigger house\n\n3:48:38.520 --> 3:48:40.360\n because they bought Bitcoin five years ago.\n\n3:48:40.360 --> 3:48:43.760\n They realized maybe I should stop mocking my cousin\n\n3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:45.120\n and start buying more Bitcoin.\n\n3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:47.560\n And this is, I think an indomitable force\n\n3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:49.240\n that's going to continue.\n\n3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:53.920\n And one thing, most Bitcoiners tend to lean\n\n3:48:53.920 --> 3:48:57.200\n toward an apocalyptic transition.\n\n3:48:57.200 --> 3:48:59.000\n Fiat's gonna collapse, we're gonna get hyperinflation,\n\n3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:00.280\n everything's gonna be terrible\n\n3:49:00.280 --> 3:49:02.600\n and then we're gonna move to Bitcoin.\n\n3:49:02.600 --> 3:49:05.400\n And I present the case for why I think\n\n3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:07.000\n maybe that might not be the case.\n\n3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:10.840\n Maybe we won't get this kind of apocalyptic scenario.\n\n3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:14.440\n And this was like the conclusion of the fiat standard,\n\n3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:16.800\n which is once you realize that mining fiat\n\n3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:20.920\n is creating debt and Bitcoin is allowing.\n\n3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:22.360\n So in order to have fiat money,\n\n3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:23.920\n we need to have people borrow.\n\n3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:26.040\n We need to have people make loans.\n\n3:49:26.040 --> 3:49:29.800\n And the problem that fiat money runs into today\n\n3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:31.880\n is that if you wanna save money,\n\n3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:35.320\n if you wanna hold savings, you have a problem.\n\n3:49:35.320 --> 3:49:36.720\n Where do you put your savings?\n\n3:49:36.720 --> 3:49:38.800\n So you put your savings in debt\n\n3:49:38.800 --> 3:49:41.000\n in the creation of more bonds.\n\n3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:42.560\n Wherever you take your savings,\n\n3:49:42.560 --> 3:49:44.200\n you create a bubble in those things.\n\n3:49:44.200 --> 3:49:46.000\n And this is why we see a bubble in the stock market,\n\n3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:48.840\n a bubble in the bond market, a bubble in housing.\n\n3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:51.080\n It's because people are looking for savings,\n\n3:49:51.080 --> 3:49:52.360\n looking for a place where they can save.\n\n3:49:52.360 --> 3:49:54.760\n All of those things are crappy saving instruments\n\n3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:58.480\n because they're like copper\n\n3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:00.720\n and that there's nothing to stop the people behind them\n\n3:50:00.720 --> 3:50:01.800\n to make more of them.\n\n3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:05.200\n House builders can build more houses.\n\n3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:06.840\n Governments can issue more bonds.\n\n3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:10.120\n The crappy fraudulent companies can list\n\n3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:12.320\n on the stock market and make more stocks.\n\n3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:14.480\n Well, Bitcoin finally offers us an outlet.\n\n3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:16.800\n We don't need to keep creating more debt.\n\n3:50:16.800 --> 3:50:20.560\n We can invest in this asset that is hard\n\n3:50:20.560 --> 3:50:23.040\n and that is internationally liquid\n\n3:50:23.040 --> 3:50:25.120\n and that nobody can make more of.\n\n3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:26.840\n So there is no bubble in it.\n\n3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:30.160\n There is no mechanism for somebody to increase the supply\n\n3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:31.880\n and bring the price crashing down,\n\n3:50:31.880 --> 3:50:34.520\n like with copper and real estate and bonds.\n\n3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:36.440\n So Bitcoin is the way out.\n\n3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:38.840\n And this is why I think there's a good case to be made\n\n3:50:38.840 --> 3:50:42.560\n for why the fiat authorities might embrace Bitcoin\n\n3:50:42.560 --> 3:50:44.440\n because they'll see it is their way out\n\n3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:49.040\n of this enormous debt bubble that everybody is stuck in.\n\n3:50:49.040 --> 3:50:51.080\n Particularly, the richest and most powerful people\n\n3:50:51.080 --> 3:50:53.240\n in the world and the richest\n\n3:50:53.240 --> 3:50:54.560\n and most powerful governments in the world\n\n3:50:54.560 --> 3:50:56.320\n are the world's biggest borrowers.\n\n3:50:56.320 --> 3:50:57.840\n They're the ones in a lot of debt.\n\n3:50:57.840 --> 3:51:02.840\n So a continuous slow devaluation of the value of that debt\n\n3:51:02.960 --> 3:51:05.440\n as people upgrade and move on to a hard asset\n\n3:51:05.440 --> 3:51:10.440\n that continues to appreciate is the peaceful way\n\n3:51:10.440 --> 3:51:13.000\n that we wind down the fiat ponzi, I think.\n\n3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.320\n You could see it being like a political,\n\n3:51:15.320 --> 3:51:18.280\n part of a political platform for future people\n\n3:51:18.280 --> 3:51:21.920\n that run for president, those kinds of things to address.\n\n3:51:21.920 --> 3:51:26.120\n Obviously, it's not just for the powerful and the rich.\n\n3:51:26.120 --> 3:51:28.240\n The people are bothered by the debt.\n\n3:51:28.240 --> 3:51:30.240\n The people are bothered by everything\n\n3:51:30.240 --> 3:51:31.920\n that you describe with fiat.\n\n3:51:31.920 --> 3:51:35.520\n And if you wanna sell yourself in a democracy\n\n3:51:35.520 --> 3:51:38.200\n as a good leader, you might want to make\n\n3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:39.720\n that part of the platform.\n\n3:51:39.720 --> 3:51:41.400\n You mentioned you know Michael Malice.\n\n3:51:41.400 --> 3:51:46.320\n He just texted me asking me to ask you,\n\n3:51:46.320 --> 3:51:49.040\n what do you like best about Michael Malice?\n\n3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:52.800\n If you can spend five to 10 to 20 to an hour\n\n3:51:52.800 --> 3:51:54.760\n talking about the genius of Michael Malice,\n\n3:51:54.760 --> 3:51:57.280\n what do you like?\n\n3:51:57.280 --> 3:51:58.440\n Where does one even start?\n\n3:51:58.440 --> 3:52:00.240\n Well, obviously, the haircut first.\n\n3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:04.000\n Yeah, he just gets sexier with age, that's for sure.\n\n3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:05.400\n That's good.\n\n3:52:05.400 --> 3:52:10.400\n Do you know his ideas, his trolling and humor,\n\n3:52:10.800 --> 3:52:12.960\n have you gotten a chance to interact with him?\n\n3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:16.360\n Yes, yes, I've met Michael maybe 10, 12 years ago\n\n3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:17.400\n in New York.\n\n3:52:17.400 --> 3:52:20.120\n I used to live in New York when he used to live in New York.\n\n3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:21.160\n Met him a couple of times.\n\n3:52:21.160 --> 3:52:24.440\n There was a bunch of anarchists in New York\n\n3:52:24.440 --> 3:52:27.320\n used to throw a happy hour once a month.\n\n3:52:27.320 --> 3:52:30.840\n It was called the High Time Preference Hoppe Hour\n\n3:52:31.720 --> 3:52:34.000\n in honor of Hans Hermann Hoppe.\n\n3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:35.440\n So I met him there a couple of times\n\n3:52:35.440 --> 3:52:39.320\n and we followed each other on Twitter for a while.\n\n3:52:39.320 --> 3:52:41.240\n Is it interesting that you're aware\n\n3:52:41.240 --> 3:52:43.960\n of philosophical differences in your worldviews?\n\n3:52:45.160 --> 3:52:47.400\n No, I think we pretty much see eye to eye.\n\n3:52:48.800 --> 3:52:51.720\n I think the difference is mainly that he spends\n\n3:52:51.720 --> 3:52:53.800\n a lot of time focusing on American politics\n\n3:52:53.800 --> 3:52:55.360\n and American pop culture,\n\n3:52:55.360 --> 3:52:57.840\n which I don't pay much attention to, I guess.\n\n3:52:57.840 --> 3:53:00.400\n So you look more at the monetary system,\n\n3:53:00.400 --> 3:53:02.680\n the economics of it all, and just the history\n\n3:53:02.680 --> 3:53:07.000\n and just looking at it, zooming out at the big picture\n\n3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:07.840\n of it all.\n\n3:53:07.840 --> 3:53:09.440\n Although recently he's working on a book called\n\n3:53:09.440 --> 3:53:14.080\n The White Pill and he's been, every time I see him,\n\n3:53:14.080 --> 3:53:18.880\n I mean, he's in some dark aspect of the 20th century.\n\n3:53:18.880 --> 3:53:22.160\n He's just like, I just finished writing about Holodomor.\n\n3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:25.440\n As you might imagine, he's not taking much, I believe,\n\n3:53:25.440 --> 3:53:27.840\n of a monetary perspective on things.\n\n3:53:27.840 --> 3:53:30.600\n His book, his writing, at least for time,\n\n3:53:30.600 --> 3:53:34.200\n has a kind of philosophical ideology perspective\n\n3:53:34.200 --> 3:53:37.120\n that's outside of the monetary system.\n\n3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:41.600\n But you argue that those are actually inextricably linked.\n\n3:53:41.600 --> 3:53:43.640\n Yeah, and I don't think he would disagree.\n\n3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:44.640\n He would.\n\n3:53:44.640 --> 3:53:49.160\n But a book has to be, can only be so long, I suppose.\n\n3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:52.680\n It can only focus on so many things.\n\n3:53:52.680 --> 3:53:56.200\n If you can put on your wise sage hat\n\n3:53:56.200 --> 3:53:58.560\n and give some advice to young people.\n\n3:53:58.560 --> 3:54:02.000\n I mean, the past four hours have been a kind of advice,\n\n3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:05.320\n but if you can focus, and if somebody in high school\n\n3:54:05.320 --> 3:54:09.400\n or college is thinking about what to do with their career,\n\n3:54:09.400 --> 3:54:11.680\n can have a successful career, or to have a life\n\n3:54:11.680 --> 3:54:13.660\n they can be proud of, what would you tell them?\n\n3:54:13.660 --> 3:54:15.640\n I'd say probably the most important advice\n\n3:54:15.640 --> 3:54:17.320\n that I would give is to find a way\n\n3:54:17.320 --> 3:54:20.240\n to give value to other people.\n\n3:54:20.240 --> 3:54:21.680\n This is really the key thing.\n\n3:54:21.680 --> 3:54:23.680\n You need to wake up every morning\n\n3:54:23.680 --> 3:54:25.640\n and figure out how to serve others.\n\n3:54:25.640 --> 3:54:30.200\n This is the key to everything you want in life.\n\n3:54:30.200 --> 3:54:32.440\n Everything that you want is on the other side\n\n3:54:32.440 --> 3:54:34.440\n of you serving others.\n\n3:54:34.440 --> 3:54:37.500\n So figure out how you can serve others in a good way,\n\n3:54:37.500 --> 3:54:39.600\n how you can do it in a way that they value.\n\n3:54:39.600 --> 3:54:42.280\n And you've got an incredible mechanism\n\n3:54:42.280 --> 3:54:45.040\n for figuring that out, which is the market.\n\n3:54:45.040 --> 3:54:47.160\n Go out there and do things for other people.\n\n3:54:47.160 --> 3:54:49.760\n And you know, the market will tell you.\n\n3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:51.600\n The market will tell you exactly.\n\n3:54:51.600 --> 3:54:53.480\n If you're young, you have the enormous advantage\n\n3:54:53.480 --> 3:54:56.800\n of being able to make mistakes, essentially,\n\n3:54:56.800 --> 3:54:58.120\n and learn from them.\n\n3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:02.120\n So go out there, do things of value for others,\n\n3:55:02.120 --> 3:55:06.320\n figuring out how you can do something that contributes,\n\n3:55:06.320 --> 3:55:07.920\n what is it that you can do that contributes\n\n3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:10.120\n the most value to other people's lives?\n\n3:55:10.120 --> 3:55:13.200\n And increasingly, I think with the modern technology,\n\n3:55:13.200 --> 3:55:15.520\n this is increasingly becoming online.\n\n3:55:15.520 --> 3:55:18.800\n And I think you should consider\n\n3:55:18.800 --> 3:55:21.360\n how you can create value online,\n\n3:55:21.360 --> 3:55:25.320\n because that scales beyond anything that you can do\n\n3:55:25.320 --> 3:55:27.920\n in the physical world in a very, very,\n\n3:55:27.920 --> 3:55:29.320\n well, maybe not beyond, obviously,\n\n3:55:29.320 --> 3:55:33.200\n there are profitable businesses in the physical world.\n\n3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:36.640\n But I think online is enormous potential,\n\n3:55:36.640 --> 3:55:39.080\n and coding, I think, is enormously powerful.\n\n3:55:39.080 --> 3:55:41.040\n I'm not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend\n\n3:55:41.040 --> 3:55:44.120\n people get into learning how to code.\n\n3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:46.380\n And I think it's probably the thing\n\n3:55:46.380 --> 3:55:48.720\n that carries the most power.\n\n3:55:48.720 --> 3:55:51.560\n So initially, we were working with our hands,\n\n3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:52.760\n we started working with machines,\n\n3:55:52.760 --> 3:55:54.480\n machines are much more productive.\n\n3:55:54.480 --> 3:55:57.600\n Well, code is an even higher level of productivity\n\n3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:00.900\n where you basically program the machines to produce things.\n\n3:56:00.900 --> 3:56:05.240\n So, you know, few clicks of a keyboard,\n\n3:56:05.240 --> 3:56:07.440\n and you can move millions of machines\n\n3:56:07.440 --> 3:56:09.240\n around the world in certain ways.\n\n3:56:09.240 --> 3:56:11.300\n So it carries an enormous amount of value.\n\n3:56:11.300 --> 3:56:15.200\n I think I always tell all young people to learn to code,\n\n3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:16.360\n it's the best thing.\n\n3:56:16.360 --> 3:56:18.680\n I used to tell it to my students when I was at university,\n\n3:56:18.680 --> 3:56:21.640\n I tell them to drop out and go learn to code.\n\n3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:23.680\n It's probably a better use of their time and money.\n\n3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:25.440\n Well, you could probably do both.\n\n3:56:25.440 --> 3:56:26.280\n Yeah.\n\n3:56:26.280 --> 3:56:28.080\n University has an interesting function.\n\n3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:30.440\n I mean, probably you and I have different perspective\n\n3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:32.240\n on this, probably has to do with a little bit\n\n3:56:32.240 --> 3:56:35.800\n of a different journey in terms of fields,\n\n3:56:35.800 --> 3:56:38.420\n because I'm so, I've stayed engineering focused\n\n3:56:38.420 --> 3:56:40.400\n for a long time, and there's less,\n\n3:56:40.400 --> 3:56:41.840\n some of the troubles you might highlight\n\n3:56:41.840 --> 3:56:44.280\n in the education system, there's less troubles\n\n3:56:44.280 --> 3:56:46.760\n of that kind in engineering,\n\n3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:49.880\n because math hasn't changed for a long time.\n\n3:56:49.880 --> 3:56:53.360\n So a lot of it is just doing hard things,\n\n3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:55.400\n being forced to do hard things,\n\n3:56:55.400 --> 3:56:57.740\n and becoming a bit of a generalist,\n\n3:56:57.740 --> 3:57:00.600\n while on the side, you're also becoming a specialist\n\n3:57:01.840 --> 3:57:04.380\n based on your own passion, driven by your own passion.\n\n3:57:04.380 --> 3:57:06.720\n So school, at least high school,\n\n3:57:06.720 --> 3:57:07.680\n I don't know about the university,\n\n3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:11.440\n but high school has a really nice,\n\n3:57:11.440 --> 3:57:13.600\n one of the only times in your life,\n\n3:57:13.600 --> 3:57:17.280\n at least in my life, I was forced,\n\n3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:20.880\n but now I see given the opportunity\n\n3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:24.480\n to spend my entire day learning broadly.\n\n3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:25.960\n And that's something, I don't know,\n\n3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:28.000\n the way time works, it just runs away from you,\n\n3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:30.160\n and you never really get a chance to do,\n\n3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:33.720\n learn quite that broadly again.\n\n3:57:33.720 --> 3:57:35.320\n That's the curse of specialization,\n\n3:57:35.320 --> 3:57:37.360\n is you kind of never get a chance\n\n3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:39.200\n to study biology, chemistry.\n\n3:57:39.200 --> 3:57:42.680\n If you're a physicist, time runs away from you.\n\n3:57:42.680 --> 3:57:46.960\n So enjoy the broad education of it.\n\n3:57:46.960 --> 3:57:48.760\n But yeah, like you said,\n\n3:57:48.760 --> 3:57:52.200\n find the things that valued by the market.\n\n3:57:53.160 --> 3:57:56.200\n And on the other side of it, you said all the good stuff.\n\n3:57:56.200 --> 3:57:58.520\n So that's also a way to get happiness.\n\n3:57:58.520 --> 3:57:59.960\n Yeah, and I'll also add,\n\n3:57:59.960 --> 3:58:01.780\n the horse that I like to whip all the time\n\n3:58:01.780 --> 3:58:04.240\n is the low time preference aspect of things,\n\n3:58:04.240 --> 3:58:06.080\n saving with Bitcoin.\n\n3:58:06.080 --> 3:58:08.640\n So I think my advice to young people is,\n\n3:58:08.640 --> 3:58:11.100\n when you're young, you think of the world\n\n3:58:11.100 --> 3:58:13.720\n in a very short term, generally.\n\n3:58:13.720 --> 3:58:15.800\n You're focused on the present,\n\n3:58:15.800 --> 3:58:17.380\n and you think that everything that's happening\n\n3:58:17.380 --> 3:58:18.920\n in the present is the most important thing\n\n3:58:18.920 --> 3:58:21.640\n that's ever gonna happen in the history of humanity.\n\n3:58:21.640 --> 3:58:23.640\n Lower your time preference, think about the future,\n\n3:58:23.640 --> 3:58:25.620\n think about, think further down the line,\n\n3:58:25.620 --> 3:58:28.340\n think about the consequences of the things you do,\n\n3:58:28.340 --> 3:58:29.180\n and then what?\n\n3:58:29.180 --> 3:58:31.120\n And so you do this now, it feels good today,\n\n3:58:31.120 --> 3:58:33.520\n but then what happens tomorrow?\n\n3:58:33.520 --> 3:58:35.320\n You go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself,\n\n3:58:35.320 --> 3:58:37.380\n well, think about the hangover.\n\n3:58:37.380 --> 3:58:40.280\n But more in longterm, think about the implication\n\n3:58:40.280 --> 3:58:42.320\n of living this kind of life.\n\n3:58:42.320 --> 3:58:44.280\n Think about every decision that you make,\n\n3:58:44.280 --> 3:58:46.080\n the longterm implication of it.\n\n3:58:46.080 --> 3:58:47.640\n And part of that is Bitcoin,\n\n3:58:47.640 --> 3:58:49.560\n part of that is save in Bitcoin.\n\n3:58:49.560 --> 3:58:54.520\n I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin for the longterm.\n\n3:58:54.520 --> 3:58:56.400\n Don't buy Bitcoin for the short term,\n\n3:58:56.400 --> 3:58:59.240\n don't buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it,\n\n3:58:59.240 --> 3:59:00.780\n don't put your savings in Bitcoin today\n\n3:59:00.780 --> 3:59:04.240\n so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house.\n\n3:59:04.240 --> 3:59:07.560\n Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin\n\n3:59:07.560 --> 3:59:11.640\n for another five, 10 years or so,\n\n3:59:11.640 --> 3:59:13.980\n at least four years is what I recommend for people.\n\n3:59:13.980 --> 3:59:15.960\n So keep a low time preference,\n\n3:59:15.960 --> 3:59:18.320\n focus on the future, and save in Bitcoin.\n\n3:59:18.320 --> 3:59:21.320\n And learn about how to buy Bitcoin,\n\n3:59:21.320 --> 3:59:23.420\n how to learn about all this technology.\n\n3:59:23.420 --> 3:59:24.800\n Part of this is this conversation,\n\n3:59:24.800 --> 3:59:26.560\n but there's so much awesome material out there.\n\n3:59:26.560 --> 3:59:28.240\n And thank you, by the way,\n\n3:59:28.240 --> 3:59:30.520\n for this gift of a hardware wallet.\n\n3:59:30.520 --> 3:59:31.360\n Nice.\n\n3:59:31.360 --> 3:59:33.880\n So you should definitely invest in it yourself.\n\n3:59:33.880 --> 3:59:36.760\n And what would you call this?\n\n3:59:36.760 --> 3:59:37.600\n These are?\n\n3:59:37.600 --> 3:59:38.420\n Open dimes.\n\n3:59:38.420 --> 3:59:39.400\n Open dimes, yeah.\n\n3:59:39.400 --> 3:59:41.800\n So this is like USB that you can,\n\n3:59:41.800 --> 3:59:44.080\n like a hardware device that stores Bitcoin.\n\n3:59:44.080 --> 3:59:45.560\n Yeah, so you don't have to worry\n\n3:59:45.560 --> 3:59:47.720\n about knowing the password.\n\n3:59:47.720 --> 3:59:50.420\n It contains the password within it and it's tamper proof.\n\n3:59:50.420 --> 3:59:52.240\n So you can save the Bitcoin on it and.\n\n3:59:52.240 --> 3:59:54.380\n So when the apocalypse comes,\n\n3:59:54.380 --> 3:59:56.920\n you need the value to be stored,\n\n3:59:56.920 --> 3:59:58.440\n an actual thing that you can have\n\n3:59:58.440 --> 3:59:59.880\n in your physical possession.\n\n3:59:59.880 --> 4:00:00.700\n Yeah.\n\n4:00:00.700 --> 4:00:02.220\n That's exactly what this is.\n\n4:00:02.220 --> 4:00:04.640\n You've had a heck of a life.\n\n4:00:04.640 --> 4:00:07.880\n You've been in a bunch of places in this world.\n\n4:00:07.880 --> 4:00:08.940\n A lot of places.\n\n4:00:08.940 --> 4:00:12.840\n Life is not easy in some of those places.\n\n4:00:12.840 --> 4:00:14.840\n What has been, if you can take a step\n\n4:00:14.840 --> 4:00:19.320\n to maybe a bit of a dark step for a short time,\n\n4:00:19.320 --> 4:00:23.720\n what has been maybe darkest time period,\n\n4:00:23.720 --> 4:00:26.040\n place you've ever gone in your mind,\n\n4:00:26.040 --> 4:00:28.520\n a dark period of your life,\n\n4:00:28.520 --> 4:00:32.160\n a struggle you had to overcome, had to survive?\n\n4:00:32.160 --> 4:00:33.680\n Well, I'm Palestinian.\n\n4:00:33.680 --> 4:00:36.560\n So that is the tragedy of my life.\n\n4:00:36.560 --> 4:00:37.960\n I'm Palestinian Jordanian.\n\n4:00:38.960 --> 4:00:43.920\n My family's suffered a lot because of this historically.\n\n4:00:43.920 --> 4:00:47.040\n I grew up in Ramallah in the West Bank.\n\n4:00:47.040 --> 4:00:50.480\n I wasn't ideal to see that.\n\n4:00:51.560 --> 4:00:54.200\n People like to think of it as this intractable conflict\n\n4:00:54.200 --> 4:00:55.800\n between two bitter enemies.\n\n4:00:55.800 --> 4:00:59.800\n But the reality of the matter is that it's not.\n\n4:00:59.800 --> 4:01:02.020\n A foreign ideology came in with the idea\n\n4:01:02.020 --> 4:01:04.480\n that this country needs to be occupied\n\n4:01:04.480 --> 4:01:06.880\n by people from only one religion\n\n4:01:06.880 --> 4:01:09.720\n and the existing population, which,\n\n4:01:09.720 --> 4:01:12.600\n I mean, Jews had always lived in Palestine historically.\n\n4:01:12.600 --> 4:01:15.040\n And at the turn of the 20th century,\n\n4:01:15.040 --> 4:01:16.920\n they were only 10% of the population.\n\n4:01:16.920 --> 4:01:19.600\n But then with the birth of fiat money,\n\n4:01:19.600 --> 4:01:22.880\n incidentally, the link with all of this is that\n\n4:01:22.880 --> 4:01:25.640\n when the Bank of England went off gold,\n\n4:01:25.640 --> 4:01:28.200\n a big reason why they were able to pull that off\n\n4:01:28.200 --> 4:01:31.040\n was that the Rothschild banking family supported them.\n\n4:01:31.040 --> 4:01:33.520\n And in exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine.\n\n4:01:33.520 --> 4:01:37.640\n And the Balfour Declaration was written\n\n4:01:37.640 --> 4:01:42.640\n by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family,\n\n4:01:42.720 --> 4:01:47.600\n telling them that they'd like to make Palestine\n\n4:01:47.600 --> 4:01:49.480\n a homeland for Jews.\n\n4:01:49.480 --> 4:01:51.880\n So obviously that's not very convenient\n\n4:01:51.880 --> 4:01:54.720\n for people who are not Jewish, for whom that is a homeland.\n\n4:01:54.720 --> 4:01:59.720\n And the past 80 years has been a very painful struggle.\n\n4:01:59.720 --> 4:02:01.320\n If you happen to not be Jewish.\n\n4:02:01.320 --> 4:02:04.600\n And obviously, you know, obviously Palestinians\n\n4:02:04.600 --> 4:02:06.640\n have done all kinds of things trying to fight back\n\n4:02:06.640 --> 4:02:09.040\n and they've done all kinds of wrong things.\n\n4:02:09.040 --> 4:02:12.000\n But I don't think you can escape the fundamental reality\n\n4:02:12.000 --> 4:02:15.000\n underlying this, which is that if you're not Jewish,\n\n4:02:15.000 --> 4:02:18.080\n you are being moved out of the land.\n\n4:02:18.080 --> 4:02:21.080\n And so it's happened in 1947, 48,\n\n4:02:21.080 --> 4:02:24.600\n happened in 1976, 1967,\n\n4:02:24.600 --> 4:02:26.460\n more land was taken over by Israel.\n\n4:02:26.460 --> 4:02:28.960\n Now you see it with the settlements.\n\n4:02:28.960 --> 4:02:31.080\n You know, if you ignore the day to day headlines\n\n4:02:31.080 --> 4:02:33.080\n and you ignore the media propaganda\n\n4:02:33.080 --> 4:02:34.760\n and you ignore all of this,\n\n4:02:34.760 --> 4:02:36.600\n there's a very clear thing that is happening,\n\n4:02:36.600 --> 4:02:41.600\n which is more land owned by an exclusive ideology\n\n4:02:42.280 --> 4:02:43.920\n that believes this land needs to be owned\n\n4:02:43.920 --> 4:02:45.480\n by people from one religion\n\n4:02:45.480 --> 4:02:47.860\n and everybody else is being kicked out.\n\n4:02:47.860 --> 4:02:52.600\n And so that is the tragedy of my life.\n\n4:02:52.600 --> 4:02:55.920\n And my wife is also a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon\n\n4:02:55.920 --> 4:02:59.520\n and her family was evicted from Jaffa,\n\n4:02:59.520 --> 4:03:02.880\n which is today on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.\n\n4:03:02.880 --> 4:03:05.480\n They still have their homes in Jaffa.\n\n4:03:05.480 --> 4:03:06.760\n Their homes are being, you know,\n\n4:03:06.760 --> 4:03:08.120\n they got kicked out of their homes\n\n4:03:08.120 --> 4:03:09.720\n and their lands and their property.\n\n4:03:09.720 --> 4:03:11.620\n They became refugees in Lebanon.\n\n4:03:11.620 --> 4:03:14.920\n So my children, you know, it's an ongoing tragedy.\n\n4:03:14.920 --> 4:03:16.420\n It's not something that is,\n\n4:03:18.160 --> 4:03:20.920\n a lot of the people that think of it as,\n\n4:03:20.920 --> 4:03:22.760\n you know, they think Palestinians are just out there\n\n4:03:22.760 --> 4:03:25.120\n to get Israelis because they hate them,\n\n4:03:25.120 --> 4:03:27.720\n but it's an inescapable tragedy.\n\n4:03:27.720 --> 4:03:29.200\n I don't have a home anywhere.\n\n4:03:29.200 --> 4:03:32.200\n Is there an escape from this tragedy in the future\n\n4:03:32.200 --> 4:03:36.620\n that you see if you zoom out across the scale of decades,\n\n4:03:38.480 --> 4:03:39.980\n will we see,\n\n4:03:41.860 --> 4:03:44.320\n I hesitate to say peace,\n\n4:03:44.320 --> 4:03:49.320\n but a significant decrease in human suffering\n\n4:03:50.080 --> 4:03:52.160\n in this part of the region?\n\n4:03:52.160 --> 4:03:53.360\n I certainly hope so.\n\n4:03:53.360 --> 4:03:58.120\n And I think, you know, my interest in Bitcoin comes from,\n\n4:03:58.120 --> 4:04:02.000\n came from a place of desperation with the situation there.\n\n4:04:02.000 --> 4:04:04.920\n Traditional politics is a dead end.\n\n4:04:05.880 --> 4:04:08.080\n I don't see what I can be doing\n\n4:04:08.080 --> 4:04:11.900\n to make things better there using traditional politics.\n\n4:04:11.900 --> 4:04:14.600\n And I think a good friend of mine, Pierre Rochard,\n\n4:04:14.600 --> 4:04:16.120\n you may know him on Twitter,\n\n4:04:16.120 --> 4:04:18.800\n one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin in my opinion,\n\n4:04:18.800 --> 4:04:20.960\n he told me his theory is that Bitcoin\n\n4:04:20.960 --> 4:04:22.560\n is gonna bring peace to the Middle East\n\n4:04:22.560 --> 4:04:24.120\n because land is a shit coin.\n\n4:04:24.120 --> 4:04:29.120\n And I think he's got a very good point there,\n\n4:04:30.040 --> 4:04:32.360\n that this fixation with land\n\n4:04:32.360 --> 4:04:35.400\n and the bitterness with which people have to live,\n\n4:04:35.400 --> 4:04:38.520\n land is likely to decline\n\n4:04:38.520 --> 4:04:40.800\n when people are gonna have a form of property\n\n4:04:40.800 --> 4:04:42.240\n that they can keep.\n\n4:04:42.240 --> 4:04:45.000\n And so hopefully that will help in one way.\n\n4:04:45.000 --> 4:04:47.200\n And of course the more obvious way\n\n4:04:47.200 --> 4:04:50.080\n is that this is a conflict of governments\n\n4:04:50.080 --> 4:04:52.480\n and it's a conflict that is financed by fiat.\n\n4:04:52.480 --> 4:04:56.560\n And from day one, the entirely insane notion\n\n4:04:56.560 --> 4:05:01.560\n that you could build a national and ethnic homeland.\n\n4:05:01.640 --> 4:05:03.880\n And of course, this is the early 20th century.\n\n4:05:03.880 --> 4:05:08.880\n So the idea behind Zionism is coming from the same place\n\n4:05:09.000 --> 4:05:11.720\n where all these other ethnic nationalisms of Europe\n\n4:05:11.720 --> 4:05:12.560\n were emerging.\n\n4:05:12.560 --> 4:05:16.520\n And we saw how well, how horribly these worked out.\n\n4:05:16.520 --> 4:05:17.920\n But the idea that you could,\n\n4:05:19.280 --> 4:05:21.240\n it's one thing to say we wanna build a homeland\n\n4:05:21.240 --> 4:05:23.600\n for Germans in Germany.\n\n4:05:23.600 --> 4:05:25.240\n It's one thing to say we wanna build the homelands\n\n4:05:25.240 --> 4:05:28.040\n for Germans somewhere else.\n\n4:05:28.040 --> 4:05:32.400\n And that was Palestine, that was Zionism.\n\n4:05:32.400 --> 4:05:34.640\n And that was only possible thanks to fiat,\n\n4:05:34.640 --> 4:05:36.600\n thanks to the ability of the British government\n\n4:05:36.600 --> 4:05:39.400\n and all these other governments to continue to finance\n\n4:05:39.400 --> 4:05:42.120\n this colonialist effort over time.\n\n4:05:42.120 --> 4:05:45.880\n And it continues to finance war\n\n4:05:45.880 --> 4:05:50.360\n and we see war all over the world continue to escalate\n\n4:05:50.360 --> 4:05:53.480\n because the people who'd make the decision\n\n4:05:53.480 --> 4:05:55.720\n to escalate the war are not the ones who are paying for it\n\n4:05:55.720 --> 4:05:57.120\n and they're not the ones who are fighting.\n\n4:05:57.120 --> 4:05:59.080\n They're the ones who sit in offices.\n\n4:05:59.080 --> 4:06:02.000\n And in the case of most of Middle Eastern conflict,\n\n4:06:02.000 --> 4:06:05.320\n it's people who live abroad.\n\n4:06:05.320 --> 4:06:07.000\n It's people who are abroad who are not part of it\n\n4:06:07.000 --> 4:06:09.160\n who just are emotionally charged to it\n\n4:06:09.160 --> 4:06:11.160\n because they watch it on TV.\n\n4:06:11.160 --> 4:06:14.280\n So you have billions of Muslims around the world\n\n4:06:14.280 --> 4:06:16.520\n and Jews around the world\n\n4:06:16.520 --> 4:06:19.400\n who feel extremely emotionally attached to it.\n\n4:06:19.400 --> 4:06:20.360\n They're not the ones fighting.\n\n4:06:20.360 --> 4:06:22.520\n They're not the ones paying their own money.\n\n4:06:22.520 --> 4:06:24.880\n They're just getting governments to send money\n\n4:06:24.880 --> 4:06:27.520\n and to send weapons and to take part.\n\n4:06:27.520 --> 4:06:32.520\n And it's fun as a spectator sport\n\n4:06:32.520 --> 4:06:33.960\n for most of these people\n\n4:06:33.960 --> 4:06:35.440\n because they don't get to live in it.\n\n4:06:35.440 --> 4:06:37.080\n But I got to live in it, I saw it.\n\n4:06:37.080 --> 4:06:37.920\n I grew up there.\n\n4:06:37.920 --> 4:06:40.800\n I saw the settlement expansion.\n\n4:06:40.800 --> 4:06:43.800\n And recently a few weeks ago, I went back to Ramallah\n\n4:06:43.800 --> 4:06:47.400\n and it's amazing every time you go,\n\n4:06:47.400 --> 4:06:50.920\n the settlements are just growing in an astonishing way.\n\n4:06:50.920 --> 4:06:55.240\n Like it's not just housing units that are going up.\n\n4:06:55.240 --> 4:06:57.560\n It's an entire attempt to build,\n\n4:06:58.720 --> 4:07:01.640\n to basically suffocate Palestinian areas\n\n4:07:01.640 --> 4:07:03.060\n and force Palestinians to leave\n\n4:07:03.060 --> 4:07:06.300\n or keep them living in horrific conditions.\n\n4:07:07.580 --> 4:07:11.760\n And if I may, just because I have family in Ukraine,\n\n4:07:11.760 --> 4:07:15.620\n I have family in Russia, since this war,\n\n4:07:15.620 --> 4:07:17.760\n echoes of similar things are happening\n\n4:07:17.760 --> 4:07:19.600\n in that part of the world too.\n\n4:07:19.600 --> 4:07:23.600\n And I shudder to think about the decades to come\n\n4:07:23.600 --> 4:07:25.400\n of the hate that is brewing,\n\n4:07:25.400 --> 4:07:27.200\n the suffering that is brewing\n\n4:07:27.200 --> 4:07:29.920\n based on decisions and pressures\n\n4:07:29.920 --> 4:07:34.920\n and from not always people directly impacted by this.\n\n4:07:36.840 --> 4:07:40.960\n So again, it feels like that military conflict\n\n4:07:40.960 --> 4:07:45.360\n is not just a creation of like people on the ground.\n\n4:07:45.360 --> 4:07:48.160\n It's a creation of leaders, power centers.\n\n4:07:48.160 --> 4:07:52.440\n And perhaps, again, I'm not smart enough,\n\n4:07:52.440 --> 4:07:55.600\n but even the monetary system probably has a role to play.\n\n4:07:55.600 --> 4:07:56.880\n I absolutely think it does.\n\n4:07:56.880 --> 4:08:00.640\n Monetary system is what allows people\n\n4:08:00.640 --> 4:08:04.160\n to just continue to treat war as a spectator sport.\n\n4:08:04.160 --> 4:08:06.000\n That's really what it comes down to.\n\n4:08:06.000 --> 4:08:09.120\n And it starts with World War I and it's continued.\n\n4:08:09.120 --> 4:08:13.320\n And this is why really, I think I've said this before,\n\n4:08:13.320 --> 4:08:15.720\n I've tweeted this before and it was a pretty popular tweet,\n\n4:08:15.720 --> 4:08:20.160\n but it also got a lot of people to dismiss the idea\n\n4:08:20.160 --> 4:08:22.040\n with mockery, of course.\n\n4:08:22.040 --> 4:08:24.320\n But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology\n\n4:08:24.320 --> 4:08:26.400\n that's going to end World War I.\n\n4:08:26.400 --> 4:08:28.440\n Once World War I started,\n\n4:08:28.440 --> 4:08:30.120\n we got into this endless conflict\n\n4:08:30.120 --> 4:08:32.240\n that's been ongoing since then.\n\n4:08:32.240 --> 4:08:33.840\n If you look at all the world's conflicts today,\n\n4:08:33.840 --> 4:08:36.400\n pretty much they all trace back to World War I.\n\n4:08:36.400 --> 4:08:39.760\n And it's because when that Pandora's box\n\n4:08:39.760 --> 4:08:42.560\n of government control of money was opened,\n\n4:08:42.560 --> 4:08:44.960\n there was no longer a real restraint on war\n\n4:08:44.960 --> 4:08:47.640\n except complete defeat and complete destruction\n\n4:08:47.640 --> 4:08:48.480\n and complete death.\n\n4:08:48.480 --> 4:08:50.200\n The war had to be total.\n\n4:08:50.200 --> 4:08:53.240\n Before that, under the gold standard,\n\n4:08:54.320 --> 4:08:57.040\n kings would send professional armies\n\n4:08:57.040 --> 4:08:59.760\n to fight each other in battlefields.\n\n4:08:59.760 --> 4:09:02.080\n And as soon as it became clear\n\n4:09:02.080 --> 4:09:04.640\n that one side was establishing an advantage,\n\n4:09:04.640 --> 4:09:09.640\n the fighting would stop and the kings would settle,\n\n4:09:10.400 --> 4:09:12.240\n would agree to new terms.\n\n4:09:12.240 --> 4:09:13.440\n Because it was extremely expensive\n\n4:09:13.440 --> 4:09:16.480\n to build a professional army and you ran out of money.\n\n4:09:16.480 --> 4:09:18.280\n So it was always the smartest thing to do\n\n4:09:18.280 --> 4:09:20.960\n is to just stop fighting whenever you could.\n\n4:09:20.960 --> 4:09:23.040\n And wars would take place.\n\n4:09:23.040 --> 4:09:25.360\n Countries would fight each other in the battlefield.\n\n4:09:25.360 --> 4:09:28.160\n But in the cities, life went on as normal.\n\n4:09:28.160 --> 4:09:30.000\n And people within the same cities,\n\n4:09:30.000 --> 4:09:31.640\n within the cities of the two countries\n\n4:09:31.640 --> 4:09:33.720\n would be trading with one another.\n\n4:09:33.720 --> 4:09:35.440\n Life would go on, but the war would be there.\n\n4:09:35.440 --> 4:09:40.440\n And it was just an independent part of politics\n\n4:09:40.440 --> 4:09:43.360\n that all right, we have a problem over this piece of land.\n\n4:09:43.360 --> 4:09:45.640\n Let's take it outside.\n\n4:09:45.640 --> 4:09:48.120\n We don't fight in the civilian areas.\n\n4:09:48.120 --> 4:09:49.520\n We go to the battlefield.\n\n4:09:49.520 --> 4:09:50.960\n We fight with professional armies.\n\n4:09:50.960 --> 4:09:53.360\n And in fact, sometimes the conflicts would be,\n\n4:09:53.360 --> 4:09:55.160\n the armies would line up\n\n4:09:55.160 --> 4:09:58.520\n and they would just have a small contingent\n\n4:09:58.520 --> 4:10:00.120\n of the two armies fight with one another.\n\n4:10:00.120 --> 4:10:02.560\n And as soon as one of them establishes an advantage,\n\n4:10:02.560 --> 4:10:06.560\n then all right, well, you won, let's move on with it.\n\n4:10:07.480 --> 4:10:09.760\n Governments were far, far, far more careful\n\n4:10:09.760 --> 4:10:14.480\n about their monetary policy and their, sorry,\n\n4:10:14.480 --> 4:10:17.120\n their war policy when they couldn't print their money.\n\n4:10:17.120 --> 4:10:19.160\n And that has changed with Fiat.\n\n4:10:19.160 --> 4:10:22.400\n And that has allowed this new emergence of this class\n\n4:10:22.400 --> 4:10:24.480\n of what I like to call chicken hawks\n\n4:10:24.480 --> 4:10:26.240\n of people who sit in offices\n\n4:10:26.240 --> 4:10:28.960\n like the entire foreign policy establishment\n\n4:10:28.960 --> 4:10:30.800\n in Washington, DC.\n\n4:10:30.800 --> 4:10:32.600\n People who have never fought in war,\n\n4:10:32.600 --> 4:10:34.640\n whose children will never fight a war,\n\n4:10:34.640 --> 4:10:36.640\n who'll never pay to fight a war,\n\n4:10:36.640 --> 4:10:39.320\n who'll never suffer a broken window\n\n4:10:39.320 --> 4:10:41.280\n in their house because of war,\n\n4:10:41.280 --> 4:10:45.160\n sitting there and based on these fucking moronic garbage\n\n4:10:45.160 --> 4:10:48.080\n that they teach at moronic Fiat universities\n\n4:10:48.080 --> 4:10:50.120\n about politics and geopolitics,\n\n4:10:50.120 --> 4:10:52.920\n making decisions about, we need to invade that country\n\n4:10:52.920 --> 4:10:54.080\n and we need to send war there.\n\n4:10:54.080 --> 4:10:56.040\n And they can do that because they have\n\n4:10:56.040 --> 4:10:57.880\n this endless money printer.\n\n4:10:57.880 --> 4:11:01.080\n And that's why, back under gold,\n\n4:11:01.080 --> 4:11:05.040\n if you were a warrior, you went and actually joined the war.\n\n4:11:05.040 --> 4:11:08.920\n And that, the people who pontificated about war\n\n4:11:08.920 --> 4:11:10.520\n were the people who had experience with war,\n\n4:11:10.520 --> 4:11:13.160\n the people who were sending their own children to war,\n\n4:11:13.160 --> 4:11:15.400\n the people who were fighting with their own money.\n\n4:11:15.400 --> 4:11:18.280\n Now you have all these fat parasitics come\n\n4:11:18.280 --> 4:11:20.240\n sitting in Washington, DC deciding,\n\n4:11:20.240 --> 4:11:21.880\n and Washington is just an example,\n\n4:11:21.880 --> 4:11:23.720\n but all over the world this exists.\n\n4:11:23.720 --> 4:11:24.680\n People who have never fought,\n\n4:11:24.680 --> 4:11:26.360\n who'll never carry the consequences,\n\n4:11:26.360 --> 4:11:29.560\n are going to devalue the world's money\n\n4:11:29.560 --> 4:11:32.760\n in order to go and have other people's children\n\n4:11:32.760 --> 4:11:35.640\n fight each other because of stupid garbage\n\n4:11:35.640 --> 4:11:39.240\n they learned about politics in university.\n\n4:11:40.760 --> 4:11:44.360\n You said you value low time preference,\n\n4:11:44.360 --> 4:11:48.160\n but I have news for you, that one day you will die,\n\n4:11:48.160 --> 4:11:50.240\n as far as we know, you're a mortal being.\n\n4:11:51.200 --> 4:11:52.560\n Do you think about your death?\n\n4:11:52.560 --> 4:11:54.320\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n4:11:55.240 --> 4:11:56.400\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n4:11:57.920 --> 4:12:02.560\n I've spent a lot of time introspecting\n\n4:12:02.560 --> 4:12:03.680\n and thinking about these things,\n\n4:12:03.680 --> 4:12:06.080\n and I value life a lot.\n\n4:12:06.080 --> 4:12:08.320\n I value my time on earth a lot,\n\n4:12:08.320 --> 4:12:11.280\n and you'll see this in my dealings with people.\n\n4:12:12.280 --> 4:12:15.360\n Go back to Twitter, why am I so brash and straightforward?\n\n4:12:15.360 --> 4:12:17.440\n It really is because life is short.\n\n4:12:17.440 --> 4:12:19.120\n Because I don't want to waste,\n\n4:12:19.120 --> 4:12:24.120\n I think on my, I've said this before,\n\n4:12:25.080 --> 4:12:27.600\n on my tombstone, let it be written.\n\n4:12:27.600 --> 4:12:30.720\n He never let anyone waste his time twice in his life.\n\n4:12:32.040 --> 4:12:33.360\n His life is short.\n\n4:12:33.360 --> 4:12:35.000\n Yeah, you can waste my time once,\n\n4:12:35.000 --> 4:12:36.280\n you can get me to do something,\n\n4:12:36.280 --> 4:12:37.680\n and then I realize that was a waste of time,\n\n4:12:37.680 --> 4:12:39.760\n you will never get me to waste my time twice.\n\n4:12:39.760 --> 4:12:42.880\n And so you show up in my Twitter with something stupid,\n\n4:12:42.880 --> 4:12:45.440\n you're never showing up in my Twitter ever again.\n\n4:12:45.440 --> 4:12:47.640\n You give people a chance, but you're a fast learner.\n\n4:12:47.640 --> 4:12:50.760\n Yeah, and I try and use my time very wisely,\n\n4:12:50.760 --> 4:12:52.840\n and I'm unapologetic about it.\n\n4:12:52.840 --> 4:12:54.320\n My time is the most precious thing,\n\n4:12:54.320 --> 4:12:58.400\n and the way to get on my shit list forever\n\n4:12:58.400 --> 4:13:02.240\n is to try and take away my time and to abuse my time.\n\n4:13:02.240 --> 4:13:07.240\n If you do that, it's the one unforgivable sin for me.\n\n4:13:08.720 --> 4:13:11.600\n And I think that's really, I think that's my way\n\n4:13:11.600 --> 4:13:13.040\n of coming to terms with mortality.\n\n4:13:13.040 --> 4:13:15.640\n We're all gonna die, and so let's make the most out of it\n\n4:13:15.640 --> 4:13:16.640\n while we're still here.\n\n4:13:16.640 --> 4:13:18.000\n And of course, the other way you come to terms\n\n4:13:18.000 --> 4:13:19.760\n with mortality is you have children.\n\n4:13:21.240 --> 4:13:26.000\n Given what you just said, doubly so,\n\n4:13:26.000 --> 4:13:27.600\n it's a huge honor that you would spend\n\n4:13:27.600 --> 4:13:29.480\n your valuable time with me.\n\n4:13:29.480 --> 4:13:30.920\n This is the first time you did it,\n\n4:13:30.920 --> 4:13:32.840\n so you probably regret all of it,\n\n4:13:32.840 --> 4:13:35.200\n so we'll probably never see each other again.\n\n4:13:35.200 --> 4:13:38.280\n But I'm glad you at least took the chance to do it.\n\n4:13:38.280 --> 4:13:39.280\n It's a huge honor, man.\n\n4:13:39.280 --> 4:13:40.880\n I've been a huge fan of yours.\n\n4:13:40.880 --> 4:13:44.160\n I think you have impact on the world\n\n4:13:44.160 --> 4:13:46.000\n that you probably are not even aware of.\n\n4:13:46.000 --> 4:13:49.160\n It's tremendous, and a lot of people love you,\n\n4:13:49.160 --> 4:13:50.280\n and your work is important.\n\n4:13:50.280 --> 4:13:53.560\n Even, you know, I disagree with some things you say,\n\n4:13:53.560 --> 4:13:55.080\n and there's people that disagree with you,\n\n4:13:55.080 --> 4:13:57.000\n but everybody respects you.\n\n4:13:57.000 --> 4:13:58.240\n And thank you so much for spending\n\n4:13:58.240 --> 4:14:00.120\n your really valuable time with me

from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.\n\n4:14:17.440 --> 4:14:19.920\n Economic control is not merely control\n\n4:14:19.920 --> 4:14:21.480\n of a sector of human life\n\n4:14:21.480 --> 4:14:23.480\n which can be separated from the rest.\n\n4:14:23.480 --> 4:14:27.640\n It is the control of the means for all our ends.\n\n4:14:27.640 --> 4:14:31.640\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
