research interests and writing\n\n00:07.640 --> 00:10.000\n are on modern American history\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:11.760\n with an eye towards presidents\n\n00:11.760 --> 00:15.200\n and in general individuals who wielded power.\n\n00:15.200 --> 00:17.000\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:22.000\n Element, Monk Pack, Belcampo, Four Sigmatic, and Eight Sleep.\n\n00:23.000 --> 00:26.680\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:26.680 --> 00:30.100\n As a side note, let me say that in these conversations,\n\n00:30.100 --> 00:34.480\n for better or worse, I seek understanding, not activism.\n\n00:34.480 --> 00:36.720\n I'm not left nor right.\n\n00:36.720 --> 00:39.240\n I love ideas, not labels.\n\n00:39.240 --> 00:41.960\n And most fascinating ideas are full of uncertainty,\n\n00:41.960 --> 00:43.720\n tension, and trade offs.\n\n00:43.720 --> 00:45.520\n Labels destroy that.\n\n00:45.520 --> 00:48.420\n I try ideas out, let them breathe for a time,\n\n00:48.420 --> 00:51.080\n try to challenge, explore, and analyze.\n\n00:51.080 --> 00:54.840\n But mostly, I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,\n\n00:54.840 --> 00:58.680\n to think and to make up your own mind, together with me.\n\n00:58.680 --> 01:02.200\n I will try to have economists and philosophers on\n\n01:02.200 --> 01:06.000\n from all points on the multidimensional political spectrum,\n\n01:06.000 --> 01:08.040\n including the extremes.\n\n01:08.040 --> 01:10.160\n I will try to both have an open mind\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:12.600\n and to ask difficult questions when needed.\n\n01:12.600 --> 01:14.200\n I'll make mistakes.\n\n01:14.200 --> 01:16.920\n Don't shoot this robot at the first sign of failure.\n\n01:16.920 --> 01:18.620\n I'm still under development.\n\n01:18.620 --> 01:21.400\n Pre release version 0.1.\n\n01:21.400 --> 01:23.480\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n01:23.480 --> 01:26.600\n and here is my conversation with Jeremy Suri.\n\n01:27.480 --> 01:31.000\n You've studied many American presidents throughout history,\n\n01:31.000 --> 01:34.480\n so who do you think was the greatest president\n\n01:34.480 --> 01:35.920\n in American history?\n\n01:35.920 --> 01:38.780\n The greatest American president was Abraham Lincoln.\n\n01:38.780 --> 01:42.720\n And Tolstoy reflected on this himself, actually,\n\n01:42.720 --> 01:45.120\n saying that when he was in the caucuses,\n\n01:45.120 --> 01:48.960\n he asked these peasants in the caucuses\n\n01:48.960 --> 01:51.400\n who was the greatest man in the world that they had heard of,\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:53.200\n and they said Abraham Lincoln.\n\n01:53.200 --> 01:54.680\n And why?\n\n01:54.680 --> 01:57.000\n Well, because he gave voice to people\n\n01:57.000 --> 01:58.880\n who had no voice before.\n\n01:58.880 --> 02:00.680\n He turned politics into an art.\n\n02:00.680 --> 02:02.180\n This is what Tolstoy recounted,\n\n02:02.180 --> 02:04.720\n the peasants in the caucuses telling him.\n\n02:04.720 --> 02:07.280\n Lincoln made politics more than about power.\n\n02:07.280 --> 02:08.440\n He made it an art.\n\n02:08.440 --> 02:10.760\n He made it a source of liberation.\n\n02:10.760 --> 02:13.240\n And those living even far from the United States\n\n02:13.240 --> 02:17.880\n could see that model, that inspiration from Lincoln.\n\n02:17.880 --> 02:20.680\n He was a man who had two years of education,\n\n02:20.680 --> 02:22.680\n yet he mastered the English language,\n\n02:22.680 --> 02:24.640\n and he used the language\n\n02:24.640 --> 02:27.760\n to help people imagine a different kind of world.\n\n02:27.760 --> 02:30.500\n You see, leaders and presidents are at their best\n\n02:30.500 --> 02:31.440\n when they're doing more\n\n02:31.440 --> 02:34.000\n than just manipulating institutions and power,\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.520\n when they're helping the people imagine a better world.\n\n02:36.520 --> 02:40.400\n And he did that as no other president has.\n\n02:40.400 --> 02:43.980\n And you say he gave voice to those who are voiceless.\n\n02:43.980 --> 02:46.400\n Who are you talking to about in general?\n\n02:46.400 --> 02:47.680\n Is this about African Americans,\n\n02:47.680 --> 02:50.880\n or is this about just the populace in general?\n\n02:50.880 --> 02:54.640\n Certainly part of it is about slaves, African Americans,\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:56.360\n and many immigrants,\n\n02:56.360 --> 02:59.120\n immigrants from all parts of Europe and other areas\n\n02:59.120 --> 03:00.720\n that have come to the United States.\n\n03:00.720 --> 03:03.240\n But part of it was just for ordinary American citizens.\n\n03:03.240 --> 03:04.480\n The Republican Party,\n\n03:04.480 --> 03:06.520\n for which Lincoln was the first president,\n\n03:06.520 --> 03:11.040\n was a party created to give voice to poor white men,\n\n03:11.040 --> 03:13.600\n as well as slaves and others.\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:15.920\n And Lincoln was a poor white man himself,\n\n03:15.920 --> 03:17.840\n grew up without slaves and without land,\n\n03:17.840 --> 03:20.120\n which meant you had almost nothing.\n\n03:20.120 --> 03:22.020\n What do you think about the trajectory of that man\n\n03:22.020 --> 03:23.960\n with only two years of education?\n\n03:24.880 --> 03:26.040\n Is there something to be said\n\n03:26.040 --> 03:28.640\n about how does one come from nothing\n\n03:28.640 --> 03:33.640\n and nurture the ideals that kind of make this country great\n\n03:36.080 --> 03:38.800\n into something where you can actually be a leader\n\n03:38.800 --> 03:41.080\n of this nation to espouse those ideas,\n\n03:41.080 --> 03:43.600\n to give the voice to the voiceless?\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:46.340\n Yes, I think you actually hit the nail on the head.\n\n03:46.340 --> 03:50.640\n I think what he represented was the opportunity,\n\n03:50.640 --> 03:52.160\n and that was the word that mattered for him,\n\n03:52.160 --> 03:57.080\n opportunity that came from the ability to raise yourself up,\n\n03:57.080 --> 04:00.360\n to work hard, and to be compensated for your hard work.\n\n04:00.360 --> 04:02.360\n And this is at the core of the Republican Party\n\n04:02.360 --> 04:05.880\n of the 19th century, which is the core of capitalism.\n\n04:05.880 --> 04:07.200\n It's not about getting rich.\n\n04:07.200 --> 04:09.400\n It's about getting compensated for your work.\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:11.800\n It's about being incentivized to do better work.\n\n04:11.800 --> 04:13.440\n And Lincoln was constantly striving.\n\n04:13.440 --> 04:17.200\n One of his closest associates, Herndon, said,\n\n04:17.200 --> 04:20.000\n he was the little engine of ambition that couldn't stop.\n\n04:20.000 --> 04:23.080\n He just kept going, taught himself to read,\n\n04:23.080 --> 04:24.240\n taught himself to be a lawyer.\n\n04:24.240 --> 04:25.620\n He went through many failed businesses\n\n04:25.620 --> 04:28.660\n before he even reached that point, many failed love affairs.\n\n04:29.640 --> 04:31.400\n But he kept trying, he kept working,\n\n04:31.400 --> 04:33.440\n and what American society offered him,\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:36.040\n and what he wanted American society to offer everyone else\n\n04:36.040 --> 04:38.760\n was the opportunity to keep trying to fail\n\n04:38.760 --> 04:40.680\n and then get up and try again.\n\n04:40.680 --> 04:42.680\n What do you think was the nature of that ambition?\n\n04:42.680 --> 04:44.240\n Was there a hunger for power?\n\n04:44.240 --> 04:46.760\n I think Lincoln had a hunger for success.\n\n04:46.760 --> 04:50.320\n I think he had a hunger to get out\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:52.400\n of the poor station he was in.\n\n04:52.400 --> 04:54.040\n He had a hunger to be someone\n\n04:54.040 --> 04:56.040\n who had control over his life.\n\n04:56.040 --> 04:58.620\n Freedom for him did not mean the right\n\n04:58.620 --> 05:00.520\n to do anything you wanna do,\n\n05:00.520 --> 05:02.480\n but it meant the right to be secure\n\n05:02.480 --> 05:05.120\n from being dependent upon someone else.\n\n05:05.120 --> 05:08.080\n So independence, he writes in his letters\n\n05:08.080 --> 05:10.320\n when he's very young that he hated\n\n05:10.320 --> 05:11.680\n being dependent on his father.\n\n05:11.680 --> 05:13.480\n He grew up without a mother.\n\n05:13.480 --> 05:15.280\n His father was a struggling farmer,\n\n05:15.280 --> 05:16.680\n and he would write in his letters\n\n05:16.680 --> 05:19.240\n that his father treated him like a slave on the farm.\n\n05:19.240 --> 05:22.640\n Some think his hatred of slavery came from that experience.\n\n05:22.640 --> 05:25.240\n He didn't ever wanna have to work for someone again.\n\n05:25.240 --> 05:26.880\n He wanted to be free and independent,\n\n05:26.880 --> 05:28.240\n and he wanted, again, every American,\n\n05:28.240 --> 05:30.480\n this is the kind of Jeffersonian dream,\n\n05:30.480 --> 05:34.000\n to be the owner of themself and the owner of their future.\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:36.100\n You know, that's a really nice definition of freedom.\n\n05:36.100 --> 05:39.160\n We often think kind of this very abstract notion\n\n05:39.160 --> 05:41.480\n of being able to do anything you want,\n\n05:41.480 --> 05:43.920\n but really, it's ultimately breaking yourself free\n\n05:43.920 --> 05:48.880\n from the constraints, like the very tight dependence\n\n05:48.880 --> 05:53.880\n on whether it's the institutions or on your family\n\n05:54.040 --> 05:57.480\n or the expectations or the community or whatever,\n\n05:57.480 --> 06:01.320\n being able to be, to realize yourself\n\n06:01.320 --> 06:03.720\n within the constraints of your own abilities.\n\n06:03.720 --> 06:05.680\n It's still not true freedom,\n\n06:05.680 --> 06:08.100\n because true freedom is probably sort of\n\n06:08.100 --> 06:09.880\n almost like designing a video game character,\n\n06:09.880 --> 06:11.000\n something like that.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:13.920\n I agree, I think that's exactly right.\n\n06:13.920 --> 06:18.920\n I think freedom is not that I can have any outcome I want.\n\n06:19.120 --> 06:20.320\n I can't control outcomes.\n\n06:20.320 --> 06:21.900\n The most powerful, freest person in the world\n\n06:21.900 --> 06:23.480\n cannot control outcomes,\n\n06:23.480 --> 06:25.320\n but it means at least I get to make choices.\n\n06:25.320 --> 06:27.620\n Someone else doesn't make those choices for me.\n\n06:29.040 --> 06:32.120\n Is there something to be said about Lincoln\n\n06:32.120 --> 06:36.040\n on the political game front of it,\n\n06:36.040 --> 06:38.480\n which is he's accomplished some of them?\n\n06:38.480 --> 06:40.360\n I don't know, but it seems like\n\n06:40.360 --> 06:42.680\n there was some tricky politics going on.\n\n06:42.680 --> 06:44.480\n We tend to not think of it in those terms\n\n06:44.480 --> 06:48.600\n because of the dark aspects of slavery.\n\n06:48.600 --> 06:51.800\n We tend to think about it in sort of ethical and human terms,\n\n06:51.800 --> 06:55.740\n but in their time, it was probably\n\n06:55.740 --> 06:58.540\n as much a game of politics,\n\n06:58.540 --> 07:02.200\n not just these broad questions of human nature, right?\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:03.280\n It was a game.\n\n07:03.280 --> 07:04.440\n So is there something to be said\n\n07:04.440 --> 07:07.040\n about being a skillful player in the game of politics\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:08.320\n that you take from Lincoln?\n\n07:08.320 --> 07:12.320\n Absolutely, and Lincoln never read Karl von Clausewitz,\n\n07:12.320 --> 07:14.200\n the great 19th century German thinker\n\n07:14.200 --> 07:15.440\n on strategy and politics,\n\n07:15.440 --> 07:17.240\n but he embodied the same wisdom,\n\n07:17.240 --> 07:18.800\n which is that everything is politics.\n\n07:18.800 --> 07:21.080\n If you want to get anything done,\n\n07:21.080 --> 07:23.760\n and this includes even relationships,\n\n07:23.760 --> 07:24.840\n there's a politics to it.\n\n07:24.840 --> 07:25.680\n What does that mean?\n\n07:25.680 --> 07:29.240\n It means that you have to persuade, coerce,\n\n07:29.240 --> 07:32.280\n encourage people to do things they wouldn't otherwise do.\n\n07:32.280 --> 07:34.640\n And Lincoln was a master at that.\n\n07:34.640 --> 07:36.080\n He was a master at that for two reasons.\n\n07:36.080 --> 07:38.760\n He had learned through his hard life to read people,\n\n07:38.760 --> 07:41.280\n to anticipate them, to spend a lot of time listening.\n\n07:41.280 --> 07:43.600\n One thing I often tell people\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:47.560\n is the best leaders are the listeners, not the talkers.\n\n07:47.560 --> 07:50.640\n And then second, Lincoln was very thoughtful\n\n07:50.640 --> 07:52.480\n and planned every move out.\n\n07:52.480 --> 07:54.240\n He was thinking three or four moves,\n\n07:54.240 --> 07:56.520\n maybe five moves down the chessboard,\n\n07:56.520 --> 07:59.200\n while others were move number one or two.\n\n07:59.200 --> 08:02.600\n That's fascinating to think about him just listening,\n\n08:02.600 --> 08:03.520\n just studying.\n\n08:03.520 --> 08:06.720\n They look at great fighters in this way,\n\n08:06.720 --> 08:10.320\n like the first few rounds of boxing and mixed martial arts,\n\n08:10.320 --> 08:12.520\n you're studying the movement of your opponent\n\n08:13.560 --> 08:16.560\n in order to sort of define the holes.\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:18.600\n That's a really interesting frame to think about it.\n\n08:18.600 --> 08:22.600\n Is there, in terms of relationships,\n\n08:23.680 --> 08:28.440\n where do you think as president or as a politician\n\n08:28.440 --> 08:30.040\n is the most impact to be had?\n\n08:30.040 --> 08:33.160\n I've been reading a lot about Hitler recently,\n\n08:33.160 --> 08:35.520\n and one of the things that I'm more and more starting\n\n08:35.520 --> 08:40.520\n to wonder, what the hell did he do alone in a room\n\n08:40.720 --> 08:42.560\n with one on one with people?\n\n08:42.560 --> 08:44.840\n Because it seems like that's where\n\n08:44.840 --> 08:46.880\n he was exceptionally effective.\n\n08:46.880 --> 08:49.080\n When I think about certain leaders,\n\n08:50.480 --> 08:53.240\n I'm not sure Stalin was this way, I apologize.\n\n08:53.240 --> 08:56.080\n Been very obsessed with this period of human history.\n\n08:57.760 --> 08:59.480\n It just seems like certain leaders\n\n08:59.480 --> 09:01.960\n are extremely effective one on one.\n\n09:01.960 --> 09:05.000\n A lot of people think of Hitler in Lincoln\n\n09:05.000 --> 09:08.640\n as a speech maker, as a great charismatic speech maker,\n\n09:08.640 --> 09:11.600\n but it seems like to me that some of these guys\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:14.840\n were really effective inside a room.\n\n09:14.840 --> 09:15.880\n What do you think?\n\n09:15.880 --> 09:17.360\n What's more important?\n\n09:17.360 --> 09:22.360\n Your effectiveness to make a hell of a good speech,\n\n09:23.640 --> 09:25.680\n sort of being in a room with many people,\n\n09:25.680 --> 09:28.280\n or is it all boiled down to one on one?\n\n09:28.280 --> 09:31.040\n Well, I think in a sense, it's both.\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:33.560\n One needs to do both, and most politicians,\n\n09:33.560 --> 09:35.480\n most leaders are better at one or the other.\n\n09:35.480 --> 09:37.800\n It's the rare leader who can do both.\n\n09:37.800 --> 09:41.600\n I will say that if you are going to be a figure\n\n09:41.600 --> 09:45.480\n who's a president or the leader of a complex organization,\n\n09:45.480 --> 09:47.400\n not a startup, but a complex organization\n\n09:47.400 --> 09:49.360\n where you have many different constituencies\n\n09:49.360 --> 09:51.440\n and many different interests,\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:53.440\n you have to do the one on one really well,\n\n09:53.440 --> 09:55.400\n because a lot of what's going to happen\n\n09:55.400 --> 09:56.760\n is you're going to be meeting with people\n\n09:56.760 --> 09:58.560\n who represent different groups, right?\n\n09:58.560 --> 10:00.240\n The leader of the labor unions,\n\n10:00.240 --> 10:03.160\n the leader of your investing board, et cetera,\n\n10:03.160 --> 10:04.960\n and you have to be able to persuade them,\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:07.640\n and it's the intangibles that often matter most.\n\n10:07.640 --> 10:10.040\n Lincoln's skill, and it's the same that FDR had,\n\n10:11.080 --> 10:13.040\n is the ability to tell a story.\n\n10:13.040 --> 10:14.640\n I think Hitler was a little different,\n\n10:14.640 --> 10:17.960\n but what I've read of Stalin is he was a storyteller too.\n\n10:17.960 --> 10:18.960\n One on one storyteller?\n\n10:18.960 --> 10:21.800\n Yeah, that's my understanding is that he,\n\n10:21.800 --> 10:22.960\n and what Lincoln did,\n\n10:22.960 --> 10:24.400\n I don't want to compare Lincoln to Stalin,\n\n10:24.400 --> 10:29.400\n but what Lincoln did is he was not confrontational.\n\n10:30.720 --> 10:32.280\n He was happy to have an argument\n\n10:32.280 --> 10:33.520\n if an argument were to be had,\n\n10:33.520 --> 10:35.680\n but actually what he would try to do\n\n10:35.680 --> 10:38.800\n is move you through telling a story\n\n10:38.800 --> 10:41.320\n that got you to think about your position in a different way,\n\n10:41.320 --> 10:43.200\n to basically disarm you.\n\n10:43.200 --> 10:44.800\n And Franklin Roosevelt did the same thing.\n\n10:44.800 --> 10:46.240\n Ronald Reagan did the same thing.\n\n10:46.240 --> 10:49.480\n Storytelling is a very important skill.\n\n10:49.480 --> 10:53.120\n It's almost heartbreaking that we don't get to have,\n\n10:53.120 --> 10:55.680\n or maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong on this,\n\n10:55.680 --> 10:58.240\n but it feels like we don't have a lot of information\n\n10:58.240 --> 11:00.760\n how all of these folks were in private,\n\n11:00.760 --> 11:02.920\n one on one conversations.\n\n11:02.920 --> 11:06.800\n Even if we get stories about it,\n\n11:06.800 --> 11:09.920\n it's like, again, sorry to bring up Hitler,\n\n11:09.920 --> 11:14.920\n but people have talked about his piercing gaze\n\n11:15.240 --> 11:16.680\n when they're one on one.\n\n11:16.680 --> 11:19.480\n There's a feeling like he's just looking through you.\n\n11:19.480 --> 11:21.080\n I wonder, it makes me wonder,\n\n11:21.080 --> 11:24.440\n was Lincoln somebody who was a little bit more passive,\n\n11:24.440 --> 11:27.760\n like who's more, the ego doesn't shine.\n\n11:27.760 --> 11:29.200\n It's not like an overwhelming thing,\n\n11:29.200 --> 11:32.320\n or is it more like, again,\n\n11:32.320 --> 11:34.000\n don't want to bring up controversial figures,\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.600\n but Donald Trump, where it's more menacing, right?\n\n11:37.600 --> 11:39.720\n There's a more like physically menacing thing,\n\n11:39.720 --> 11:43.960\n where it's almost like a bullying kind of dynamic.\n\n11:43.960 --> 11:47.280\n So I wonder, I wish we knew.\n\n11:47.280 --> 11:50.520\n Because from a psychological perspective,\n\n11:50.520 --> 11:52.000\n I wonder if there's a thread\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:53.600\n that connects most great leaders.\n\n11:53.600 --> 11:55.080\n That's a great question.\n\n11:55.080 --> 11:58.120\n So I think the best writer on this is Max Weber, right?\n\n11:58.120 --> 12:00.560\n And he talks about the power of charisma,\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:02.840\n that the term charisma comes from Weber, right?\n\n12:02.840 --> 12:05.960\n And Weber's use of it actually to talk about profits.\n\n12:05.960 --> 12:07.880\n And I think he has a point, right?\n\n12:07.880 --> 12:10.760\n Leaders who are effective in the way you describe\n\n12:10.760 --> 12:12.800\n are leaders who feel prophetic,\n\n12:12.800 --> 12:15.880\n or Weber says they have a kind of magic about them.\n\n12:15.880 --> 12:17.880\n And I think that can come from different sources.\n\n12:17.880 --> 12:20.600\n I think that can come from the way someone\n\n12:20.600 --> 12:21.520\n carries themselves.\n\n12:21.520 --> 12:24.000\n It can come from the way they use words.\n\n12:24.000 --> 12:26.520\n So maybe there are different kinds of magic\n\n12:26.520 --> 12:27.960\n that someone develops.\n\n12:27.960 --> 12:29.240\n But I think there are two things\n\n12:29.240 --> 12:31.400\n that seem to be absolutely necessary.\n\n12:31.400 --> 12:33.760\n First is you have to be someone who sizes up the person\n\n12:33.760 --> 12:35.080\n on the other side of the table.\n\n12:35.080 --> 12:36.760\n You cannot be the person who just comes in\n\n12:36.760 --> 12:38.760\n and reads your brief.\n\n12:38.760 --> 12:41.240\n And then second, I think it's interactive.\n\n12:42.160 --> 12:44.280\n And there is a quickness of thought.\n\n12:44.280 --> 12:45.800\n So you brought up Donald Trump.\n\n12:45.800 --> 12:47.840\n I don't think Donald Trump is a deep thinker at all,\n\n12:47.840 --> 12:48.680\n but he's quick.\n\n12:49.560 --> 12:51.720\n And I think that quickness is part of,\n\n12:51.720 --> 12:53.800\n it's different from delivering a lecture\n\n12:53.800 --> 12:55.080\n where it's the depth of your thought.\n\n12:55.080 --> 12:57.760\n Can you for 45 minutes analyze something?\n\n12:57.760 --> 12:59.320\n Many people can't do that,\n\n12:59.320 --> 13:01.280\n but they still might be very effective\n\n13:01.280 --> 13:03.480\n if they're able to quickly react,\n\n13:03.480 --> 13:05.720\n size up the person on the other side of the table\n\n13:05.720 --> 13:07.840\n and react in a way that moves that person\n\n13:07.840 --> 13:09.920\n in the way they wanna move them.\n\n13:09.920 --> 13:13.720\n Yeah, and there's also just coupled with the quickness\n\n13:13.720 --> 13:17.360\n as a kind of instinct about human nature.\n\n13:17.360 --> 13:19.000\n Sort of asking the question,\n\n13:19.920 --> 13:22.280\n what does this person worry about?\n\n13:22.280 --> 13:24.040\n What are the biggest problems?\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:27.160\n Somebody, what is this, Stephen Schwartzman, I think,\n\n13:27.160 --> 13:29.720\n said to me, he's this businessman.\n\n13:29.720 --> 13:33.080\n I think he said like, what I've always tried to do\n\n13:33.080 --> 13:36.960\n is try to figure out, like ask enough questions\n\n13:36.960 --> 13:38.880\n to figure out what is the biggest problem\n\n13:38.880 --> 13:40.880\n in this person's life.\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:42.760\n Try to get a sense of what is the biggest problem\n\n13:42.760 --> 13:44.120\n in their life, because that's actually\n\n13:44.120 --> 13:45.760\n what they care about most.\n\n13:45.760 --> 13:48.560\n And most people don't care enough to find out.\n\n13:48.560 --> 13:52.200\n And so he kind of wants to sneak up on that\n\n13:52.200 --> 13:57.200\n and find that, and then use that to then build closeness\n\n13:58.200 --> 14:00.640\n in order to then probably, he doesn't put it in those words,\n\n14:00.640 --> 14:03.000\n but to manipulate the person into whatever,\n\n14:03.000 --> 14:04.440\n to do whatever the heck they want.\n\n14:04.440 --> 14:09.080\n And I think part of it is that,\n\n14:09.080 --> 14:11.600\n and part of the effect that Donald Trump has\n\n14:11.600 --> 14:14.240\n is how quick he's able to figure that out.\n\n14:14.240 --> 14:17.440\n You've written a book about how the role\n\n14:17.440 --> 14:19.880\n and power of the presidency has changed.\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:24.600\n So how has it changed since Lincoln's time,\n\n14:25.500 --> 14:28.540\n the evolution of the presidency as a concept,\n\n14:28.540 --> 14:30.560\n which seems like a fascinating lens\n\n14:30.560 --> 14:33.280\n through which to look at American history.\n\n14:33.280 --> 14:36.720\n As a president, we seem to only be talking\n\n14:36.720 --> 14:40.020\n about the presidents, maybe a general here and there,\n\n14:40.020 --> 14:43.600\n but it's mostly the story of America is often told\n\n14:43.600 --> 14:45.160\n through presidents.\n\n14:45.160 --> 14:46.680\n That's right, that's right.\n\n14:46.680 --> 14:48.560\n And one of the points I've tried to make\n\n14:48.560 --> 14:52.240\n in my writing about this and various other activities\n\n14:52.240 --> 14:55.640\n is we use this word president as if it's something timeless,\n\n14:55.640 --> 14:58.480\n but the office has changed incredibly.\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:00.480\n Just from Lincoln's time to the present,\n\n15:00.480 --> 15:05.240\n which is 150 years, he wouldn't recognize the office today.\n\n15:05.240 --> 15:07.400\n And George Washington would not have recognized it\n\n15:07.400 --> 15:10.780\n in Lincoln, just as I think a CEO today\n\n15:10.780 --> 15:13.760\n would be unrecognizable to a Rockefeller\n\n15:13.760 --> 15:16.640\n or a Carnegie of 150 years ago.\n\n15:16.640 --> 15:18.880\n So what are some of the ways in which the office has changed?\n\n15:18.880 --> 15:21.280\n I'll just point to three, there are a lot.\n\n15:21.280 --> 15:25.560\n One, presidents now can communicate with the public directly.\n\n15:25.560 --> 15:26.600\n I mean, we've reached the point now\n\n15:26.600 --> 15:28.040\n where a president can have direct,\n\n15:28.040 --> 15:30.020\n almost one on one communication.\n\n15:30.020 --> 15:32.280\n President can use Twitter if he so chooses\n\n15:32.280 --> 15:35.120\n to circumvent all media.\n\n15:35.120 --> 15:36.160\n That was unthinkable.\n\n15:36.160 --> 15:38.360\n Lincoln, in order to get his message across,\n\n15:38.360 --> 15:40.560\n often wrote letters to newspapers.\n\n15:40.560 --> 15:42.640\n And waited for the newspaper for Horace Greeley\n\n15:42.640 --> 15:44.800\n in the New York Tribune to publish his letter.\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:46.200\n That's how he communicated with the public.\n\n15:46.200 --> 15:48.200\n There weren't even many speaking opportunities.\n\n15:48.200 --> 15:49.820\n So that's a big change, right?\n\n15:49.820 --> 15:52.200\n We feel the president in our life much more.\n\n15:52.200 --> 15:55.240\n That's why we talk about him much more.\n\n15:55.240 --> 15:56.280\n That also creates more of a burden.\n\n15:56.280 --> 15:57.240\n This is the second point.\n\n15:57.240 --> 15:59.480\n Presidents are under a microscope.\n\n15:59.480 --> 16:00.760\n Presidents are under a microscope.\n\n16:00.760 --> 16:02.920\n You have to be very careful what you do and what you say.\n\n16:02.920 --> 16:06.600\n And you're judged by a lot of the elements of your behavior\n\n16:06.600 --> 16:07.860\n that are not policy relevant.\n\n16:07.860 --> 16:09.320\n In fact, the things we judge most\n\n16:09.320 --> 16:12.000\n and make most of our decisions on about individuals\n\n16:12.000 --> 16:13.080\n are often that.\n\n16:13.080 --> 16:17.640\n And then third, the power the president has.\n\n16:17.640 --> 16:19.180\n It's inhuman, actually.\n\n16:19.180 --> 16:20.480\n And this is one of my critiques\n\n16:20.480 --> 16:21.560\n of how the office has changed.\n\n16:21.560 --> 16:24.240\n This one person has power on a scale\n\n16:24.240 --> 16:27.280\n that's I think dangerous in a democracy.\n\n16:27.280 --> 16:31.920\n And certainly something the founders 220 years ago\n\n16:31.920 --> 16:34.420\n would have had trouble conceiving.\n\n16:34.420 --> 16:36.560\n Presidents now have the ability to deliver force\n\n16:36.560 --> 16:39.540\n across the world to literally assassinate people\n\n16:39.540 --> 16:41.600\n with a remarkable accuracy.\n\n16:41.600 --> 16:44.640\n And that's an enormous power that presidents have.\n\n16:44.640 --> 16:48.240\n So your sense, this is not to get conspiratorial,\n\n16:48.240 --> 16:53.240\n but do you think a president currently has the power\n\n16:53.640 --> 16:58.640\n to initiate the assassination of somebody,\n\n16:59.140 --> 17:03.520\n of a political enemy or a terrorist leader\n\n17:03.520 --> 17:07.480\n or that kind of thing to frame that person in a way\n\n17:07.480 --> 17:10.640\n where assassination is something that he alone\n\n17:10.640 --> 17:12.360\n or she alone could decide to do?\n\n17:12.360 --> 17:13.520\n I think it happens all the time\n\n17:13.520 --> 17:14.680\n and it's not to be conspiratorial.\n\n17:14.680 --> 17:19.360\n This is how we fought terrorism by targeting individuals.\n\n17:19.360 --> 17:21.680\n Now you might say these were not elected leaders of state,\n\n17:21.680 --> 17:23.400\n but these were individuals with a large following.\n\n17:23.400 --> 17:25.640\n I mean, the killing of Osama Bin Laden\n\n17:25.640 --> 17:28.960\n was an assassination operation.\n\n17:28.960 --> 17:32.000\n And we've taken out very successfully\n\n17:32.000 --> 17:34.000\n many leaders of terrorist organizations\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.640\n and we do it every day.\n\n17:35.640 --> 17:37.640\n You're saying that back in Lincoln's time\n\n17:37.640 --> 17:39.120\n or George Washington's time,\n\n17:39.120 --> 17:40.760\n there was more of a balance of power?\n\n17:40.760 --> 17:42.520\n Like a president could not initiate\n\n17:42.520 --> 17:43.840\n this kind of assassination?\n\n17:43.840 --> 17:46.120\n Correct, I think presidents did not have\n\n17:46.120 --> 17:49.280\n the same kind of military or economic power.\n\n17:49.280 --> 17:52.080\n We could talk about how a president can influence a market\n\n17:52.080 --> 17:56.720\n by saying something about where money is gonna go\n\n17:56.720 --> 18:00.000\n or singling out a company or critiquing a company\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.220\n in one way or another.\n\n18:01.220 --> 18:02.360\n They didn't have that kind of power.\n\n18:02.360 --> 18:06.020\n Now, much of the power that a Lincoln or a Washington had\n\n18:06.020 --> 18:08.200\n was the power to mobilize people\n\n18:08.200 --> 18:09.720\n to then make their own decisions.\n\n18:09.720 --> 18:11.540\n At the start of the Civil War,\n\n18:11.540 --> 18:12.720\n Lincoln doesn't even have the power\n\n18:12.720 --> 18:13.920\n to bring people into the army.\n\n18:13.920 --> 18:15.620\n He has to go to the governors\n\n18:15.620 --> 18:18.280\n and ask the governors to provide soldiers.\n\n18:18.280 --> 18:19.640\n So the governor of Wisconsin,\n\n18:19.640 --> 18:20.800\n the governor of Massachusetts.\n\n18:20.800 --> 18:22.280\n Could you imagine that today?\n\n18:22.280 --> 18:27.280\n So, but yeah, so they use speeches and words\n\n18:27.280 --> 18:32.280\n to mobilize versus direct action in closed door environments,\n\n18:32.500 --> 18:34.640\n initiating wars, for example.\n\n18:34.640 --> 18:35.480\n Correct.\n\n18:37.160 --> 18:39.140\n It's difficult to think about,\n\n18:39.140 --> 18:41.280\n if we look at Barack Obama, for example,\n\n18:43.200 --> 18:44.640\n if you're listening to this\n\n18:45.740 --> 18:47.920\n and you're on the left or the right,\n\n18:47.920 --> 18:49.220\n please do not make this political.\n\n18:49.220 --> 18:51.520\n In fact, if you're a political person\n\n18:51.520 --> 18:54.240\n and you're getting angry at the mention of the word Obama\n\n18:54.240 --> 18:56.560\n or Donald Trump, please turn off this podcast\n\n18:56.560 --> 18:57.960\n that I've just described.\n\n18:57.960 --> 18:59.560\n We're not gonna get very far.\n\n18:59.560 --> 19:02.180\n I hope we maintain a political discussion\n\n19:02.180 --> 19:05.040\n about even the modern presidents\n\n19:05.040 --> 19:07.460\n that view through the lens of history.\n\n19:07.460 --> 19:09.040\n I think there's a lot to be learned\n\n19:09.040 --> 19:12.200\n about the office and about human nature.\n\n19:13.080 --> 19:15.060\n Some people criticize Barack Obama\n\n19:15.060 --> 19:19.520\n for sort of expanding the military industrial complex,\n\n19:19.520 --> 19:22.200\n engaging in more and more wars,\n\n19:22.200 --> 19:25.620\n as opposed to sort of the initial rhetoric\n\n19:25.620 --> 19:27.680\n was such that we would pull back\n\n19:28.560 --> 19:30.720\n from sort of be more skeptical\n\n19:30.720 --> 19:33.120\n in our decisions to wage wars.\n\n19:33.120 --> 19:36.880\n So from the lens of the power of the presidency,\n\n19:36.880 --> 19:38.540\n as the modern presidency,\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:41.920\n the fact that we continued the war in Afghanistan\n\n19:41.920 --> 19:45.640\n and different engagements in military conflicts,\n\n19:46.740 --> 19:51.740\n do you think Barack Obama could have stopped that?\n\n19:52.320 --> 19:55.480\n Do you put the responsibility on that expansion\n\n19:55.480 --> 19:58.160\n on him because of the implied power\n\n19:58.160 --> 19:59.720\n that the presidency has?\n\n19:59.720 --> 20:01.920\n Or is this power just sits there\n\n20:01.920 --> 20:04.560\n and if a president chooses to take it, they do,\n\n20:04.560 --> 20:06.840\n and if they don't, they don't?\n\n20:06.840 --> 20:10.080\n Almost like you don't want to take on the responsibility\n\n20:10.080 --> 20:12.960\n because of the burden of that responsibility.\n\n20:12.960 --> 20:16.360\n So a lot of my research is about this exact question,\n\n20:16.360 --> 20:17.680\n not just with Obama.\n\n20:17.680 --> 20:19.780\n And my conclusion, and I think the research\n\n20:19.780 --> 20:21.920\n is pretty clear on this, is that structure\n\n20:21.920 --> 20:24.940\n has a lot more effect on us than we like to admit,\n\n20:24.940 --> 20:26.760\n which is to say that the circumstances,\n\n20:26.760 --> 20:29.540\n the institutions around us drive our behavior\n\n20:29.540 --> 20:30.600\n more than we like to think.\n\n20:30.600 --> 20:32.640\n So Barack Obama, I'm quite certain,\n\n20:32.640 --> 20:34.840\n came into the office of the presidency committed\n\n20:34.840 --> 20:37.880\n to actually reducing the use of military force overseas\n\n20:37.880 --> 20:40.800\n and reducing presidential war making power.\n\n20:40.800 --> 20:43.180\n As a trained lawyer, he had a moral position\n\n20:43.180 --> 20:45.320\n on this actually, and he tried.\n\n20:45.320 --> 20:47.700\n And he did withdraw American forces from Iraq\n\n20:47.700 --> 20:50.640\n and was of course criticized by many people for doing that.\n\n20:50.640 --> 20:52.680\n But at the same time, he had some real problems\n\n20:52.680 --> 20:55.600\n in the world to deal with, terrorism being one of them.\n\n20:55.600 --> 20:59.040\n And the tools he has are very much biased\n\n20:59.040 --> 21:01.080\n towards the use of military force.\n\n21:01.080 --> 21:04.160\n It's much harder as president to go and get Vladimir Putin\n\n21:04.160 --> 21:06.400\n and Xi Jinping to agree with you.\n\n21:06.400 --> 21:09.800\n It's much easier to send these wonderful toys we have\n\n21:09.800 --> 21:12.800\n and these incredible soldiers we have over there.\n\n21:12.800 --> 21:15.860\n And when you have Congress, which is always against you,\n\n21:15.860 --> 21:17.640\n it's also easier to use the military\n\n21:17.640 --> 21:18.920\n because you send them there.\n\n21:18.920 --> 21:21.040\n And even if members of Congress from your own party\n\n21:21.040 --> 21:23.000\n or the other are angry at you,\n\n21:23.000 --> 21:24.240\n they'll still fund the soldiers.\n\n21:24.240 --> 21:25.920\n No member of Congress wants to vote\n\n21:25.920 --> 21:27.980\n to starve our soldiers overseas.\n\n21:27.980 --> 21:29.000\n So they'll stop your budget,\n\n21:29.000 --> 21:31.240\n they'll even threaten not to pay the debt,\n\n21:31.240 --> 21:33.040\n but they'll still fund your soldiers.\n\n21:33.040 --> 21:36.960\n And so you are pushed by the circumstances you're in\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:39.880\n to do this, and it's very hard to resist.\n\n21:39.880 --> 21:42.360\n So that's, I think the criticism of Obama,\n\n21:42.360 --> 21:45.080\n the fair one would be that he didn't resist the pressures\n\n21:45.080 --> 21:47.800\n that were there, but he did not make those pressures.\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:52.000\n So is there something about putting the responsibility\n\n21:52.000 --> 21:57.000\n on the president to form the structure around him locally\n\n21:57.040 --> 22:01.580\n such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric?\n\n22:01.580 --> 22:04.800\n So what I'm talking to is hiring.\n\n22:05.680 --> 22:08.840\n So basically just everybody you work with,\n\n22:08.840 --> 22:12.120\n you have power as a president to fire and hire\n\n22:12.120 --> 22:16.400\n or to basically schedule meetings in such a way\n\n22:16.400 --> 22:19.960\n that can control your decision making.\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:24.380\n So I imagine it's very difficult to get out of Afghanistan\n\n22:24.380 --> 22:28.520\n or Iraq when most of your scheduled meetings\n\n22:28.520 --> 22:31.240\n are with generals or something like that.\n\n22:31.240 --> 22:33.720\n But if you reorganize the schedule\n\n22:33.720 --> 22:37.740\n and you reorganize who you have like late night talks with,\n\n22:37.740 --> 22:41.860\n you potentially have a huge ripple effect on the policy.\n\n22:41.860 --> 22:42.700\n I think that's right.\n\n22:42.700 --> 22:44.600\n I think who has access to the president\n\n22:44.600 --> 22:45.880\n is absolutely crucial.\n\n22:45.880 --> 22:48.080\n And presidents have to be more strategic about that.\n\n22:48.080 --> 22:50.480\n They tend to be reacting to crises\n\n22:50.480 --> 22:52.200\n because every day has a crisis.\n\n22:52.200 --> 22:53.240\n And if you're reacting to a crisis,\n\n22:53.240 --> 22:54.360\n you're not controlling access\n\n22:54.360 --> 22:56.300\n because the crisis is driving you.\n\n22:56.300 --> 22:57.640\n So that's one element of it.\n\n22:57.640 --> 23:00.200\n But I also think, and this is the moment we're in right now,\n\n23:00.200 --> 23:04.140\n presidents have to invest in reforming the system,\n\n23:04.140 --> 23:05.820\n the system of decision making.\n\n23:05.820 --> 23:07.760\n Should we have a national security council\n\n23:07.760 --> 23:09.320\n that looks the way it does?\n\n23:09.320 --> 23:11.620\n Should our military be structured the way it is?\n\n23:11.620 --> 23:14.680\n The founding fathers wanted a military that was divided.\n\n23:14.680 --> 23:17.000\n They did not want a unified department of defense.\n\n23:17.000 --> 23:19.160\n That was only created after World War II.\n\n23:19.160 --> 23:20.800\n Should we have as large a military as we have?\n\n23:20.800 --> 23:23.040\n Should we be in as many places?\n\n23:23.040 --> 23:25.320\n There are some fundamental structural reforms\n\n23:25.320 --> 23:26.720\n we have to undertake.\n\n23:26.720 --> 23:28.180\n And part of that is who you appoint,\n\n23:28.180 --> 23:30.620\n but part of that is also how you change the institutions.\n\n23:30.620 --> 23:32.320\n The genius of the American system\n\n23:32.320 --> 23:34.220\n is that it's a dynamic system.\n\n23:34.220 --> 23:35.480\n It can be adjusted.\n\n23:35.480 --> 23:37.200\n It has been adjusted over time.\n\n23:37.200 --> 23:39.600\n That's the heroic story.\n\n23:39.600 --> 23:43.600\n The frustrating story is it often takes us a long time\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:45.440\n to make those adjustments until we go\n\n23:45.440 --> 23:48.800\n into such bad circumstances that we have no choice.\n\n23:48.800 --> 23:53.480\n So in the battle of power of the office of the president\n\n23:53.480 --> 23:56.540\n versus the United States military,\n\n23:56.540 --> 23:58.720\n the department of defense,\n\n23:58.720 --> 24:00.000\n do you have a sense that the president\n\n24:00.000 --> 24:01.960\n has more power ultimately?\n\n24:01.960 --> 24:06.060\n So to decrease the size of the department of defense,\n\n24:06.060 --> 24:08.620\n to withdraw from any wars,\n\n24:08.620 --> 24:11.200\n or increase the amount of wars,\n\n24:11.200 --> 24:13.880\n is the president, you're kind of implying\n\n24:13.880 --> 24:16.700\n the president has a lot of power here in this scale.\n\n24:16.700 --> 24:18.280\n Yes, the president has a lot of power\n\n24:18.280 --> 24:20.440\n and we are fortunate and it was just proven\n\n24:20.440 --> 24:22.560\n in the last few years that our military,\n\n24:22.560 --> 24:26.140\n uniquely among many countries with large militaries,\n\n24:26.140 --> 24:27.920\n is very deferential to the president\n\n24:27.920 --> 24:29.540\n and very restricted in its ability\n\n24:29.540 --> 24:31.360\n to challenge the president.\n\n24:31.360 --> 24:33.800\n So that's a strength of our system.\n\n24:33.800 --> 24:35.920\n But the way you reform the military\n\n24:35.920 --> 24:37.640\n is not with individual decisions.\n\n24:37.640 --> 24:40.380\n It's by having a strategic plan\n\n24:40.380 --> 24:43.080\n that reexamines what role it plays.\n\n24:43.080 --> 24:45.640\n So it's not just about whether we're in Afghanistan or not.\n\n24:45.640 --> 24:47.520\n The question we have to ask is,\n\n24:47.520 --> 24:48.880\n when we look at our toolbox\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:51.560\n of what we can do in our foreign policy,\n\n24:51.560 --> 24:54.920\n are there other tools we should build up\n\n24:54.920 --> 24:58.020\n and therefore some tools in the military we should reduce?\n\n24:58.020 --> 25:00.320\n That's the broader strategic question.\n\n25:00.320 --> 25:03.180\n Let me ask you the most absurd question of all\n\n25:03.180 --> 25:04.600\n that you did not sign up for,\n\n25:04.600 --> 25:06.720\n but I've been hanging out\n\n25:06.720 --> 25:08.720\n with a guy named Joe Rogan recently,\n\n25:08.720 --> 25:13.560\n so it's very important for me and him to figure this out.\n\n25:13.560 --> 25:15.560\n If a president, because you said,\n\n25:15.560 --> 25:17.640\n you implied the president's very powerful,\n\n25:17.640 --> 25:21.320\n if a president shows up and the US government is in fact\n\n25:21.320 --> 25:24.040\n in possession of aliens, alien spacecraft,\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:28.720\n do you think the president will be told?\n\n25:28.720 --> 25:32.840\n A more responsible adult historian question version of that\n\n25:32.840 --> 25:37.680\n is, is there some things that the machine of government\n\n25:37.680 --> 25:40.560\n keeps secret from the president?\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:42.720\n Or is the president ultimately at the very center?\n\n25:42.720 --> 25:46.520\n So if you map out the set of information and power,\n\n25:46.520 --> 25:49.200\n you have CIA, you have all these organizations\n\n25:49.200 --> 25:53.800\n that do the machinery of government,\n\n25:53.800 --> 25:55.800\n not just the passing of bills,\n\n25:55.800 --> 26:00.800\n but gaining information, homeland security,\n\n26:01.680 --> 26:06.680\n actually engaging in wars, all those kinds of things.\n\n26:06.680 --> 26:09.160\n How central is the president?\n\n26:09.160 --> 26:11.440\n Would the president know some of the shady things\n\n26:11.440 --> 26:12.420\n that are going on?\n\n26:14.080 --> 26:18.740\n Aliens or some kind of cybersecurity stuff\n\n26:18.740 --> 26:21.400\n against Russia and China, all those kinds of things,\n\n26:21.400 --> 26:23.440\n is the president really made aware?\n\n26:23.440 --> 26:26.440\n And if so, how nervous does that make you?\n\n26:26.440 --> 26:30.880\n So presidents like leaders of any complex organizations\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:32.880\n don't know everything that goes on.\n\n26:32.880 --> 26:34.140\n They have to ask the right questions.\n\n26:34.140 --> 26:35.600\n This is Machiavelli.\n\n26:35.600 --> 26:38.680\n Most important thing a leader has to do\n\n26:38.680 --> 26:40.100\n is ask the right questions.\n\n26:40.100 --> 26:41.840\n You don't have to know the answers.\n\n26:41.840 --> 26:43.680\n That's why you hire smart people,\n\n26:43.680 --> 26:45.400\n but you have to ask the right questions.\n\n26:45.400 --> 26:48.440\n So if the president asks the US government,\n\n26:48.440 --> 26:50.320\n those who are responsible for the aliens\n\n26:50.320 --> 26:53.640\n or responsible for the cyber warfare against Russia,\n\n26:53.640 --> 26:56.160\n they will answer honestly, they will have to,\n\n26:56.160 --> 27:00.000\n but they will not volunteer that information in all cases.\n\n27:00.000 --> 27:01.560\n So the best way a president can operate\n\n27:01.560 --> 27:04.680\n is to have people around him or her\n\n27:04.680 --> 27:06.640\n who are not the traditional policymakers,\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:09.520\n this is where I think academic experts are important,\n\n27:09.520 --> 27:12.800\n suggesting questions to ask\n\n27:12.800 --> 27:14.760\n to therefore try to get the information.\n\n27:14.760 --> 27:18.480\n It makes me nervous because I think human nature\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:22.060\n is such that the academics, the experts,\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:27.120\n everybody is almost afraid to ask the questions\n\n27:27.120 --> 27:32.120\n for which the answers might be burdensome.\n\n27:32.800 --> 27:33.840\n Yes.\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:34.880\n And so that's right.\n\n27:34.880 --> 27:37.720\n And you can get into a lot of trouble not asking,\n\n27:37.720 --> 27:40.160\n it's the old elephant in the room.\n\n27:40.160 --> 27:41.840\n Correct, correct.\n\n27:42.960 --> 27:44.160\n This is exactly right.\n\n27:44.160 --> 27:46.720\n And too often mediocre leaders\n\n27:46.720 --> 27:49.520\n and those who try to protect them try to shield themselves.\n\n27:49.520 --> 27:51.480\n They don't want to know certain things.\n\n27:51.480 --> 27:53.200\n So this is part of what happened\n\n27:53.200 --> 27:55.640\n with the use of torture by the United States,\n\n27:55.640 --> 27:59.400\n which is a war crime during the war on terror.\n\n27:59.400 --> 28:02.640\n President Bush at times intentionally did not ask\n\n28:02.640 --> 28:04.880\n and people around him prevented him from asking\n\n28:04.880 --> 28:06.520\n or discouraged him from asking questions\n\n28:06.520 --> 28:09.640\n he should have asked to know about what was going on.\n\n28:09.640 --> 28:12.360\n And that's how we ended up where we did.\n\n28:12.360 --> 28:15.360\n You could say the same thing about Reagan and Iran Contra.\n\n28:15.360 --> 28:18.600\n I wonder what it takes to be the kind of leader\n\n28:18.600 --> 28:21.160\n that steps in and asks some difficult questions.\n\n28:21.160 --> 28:24.640\n So aliens is one, UFO spacecraft, right?\n\n28:25.560 --> 28:28.320\n Another one, yeah, torture is another one.\n\n28:28.320 --> 28:30.560\n The CIA, how much information\n\n28:30.560 --> 28:32.720\n is being collected about Americans?\n\n28:32.720 --> 28:35.640\n I can see as a president being very uncomfortable\n\n28:35.640 --> 28:37.120\n asking that question.\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:39.480\n Because if the answer is a lot of information\n\n28:39.480 --> 28:41.640\n is being collected by Americans,\n\n28:41.640 --> 28:43.560\n then you have to be the guy\n\n28:43.560 --> 28:46.480\n who lives with that information.\n\n28:46.480 --> 28:50.040\n For the rest of your life, you have to walk around.\n\n28:50.040 --> 28:53.320\n You're probably not going to reform that system.\n\n28:53.320 --> 28:54.160\n It's very difficult.\n\n28:54.160 --> 28:55.640\n You probably have to be very picky\n\n28:55.640 --> 28:57.080\n about which things you reform.\n\n28:57.080 --> 28:58.680\n You don't have much time.\n\n28:58.680 --> 29:01.760\n It takes a lot of sort of effort to restructure things.\n\n29:01.760 --> 29:04.880\n But you nevertheless would have to be basically lying\n\n29:06.000 --> 29:11.000\n to yourself, to others around you\n\n29:11.080 --> 29:13.240\n about the unethical things.\n\n29:13.240 --> 29:17.200\n Depends of course what your ethical system is.\n\n29:17.200 --> 29:20.400\n I wonder what it takes to ask those hard questions.\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:25.400\n I wonder if how few of us can be great leaders like that.\n\n29:25.400 --> 29:29.400\n And I wonder if our political system, the electoral system\n\n29:29.400 --> 29:32.160\n is such that makes it likely\n\n29:32.160 --> 29:34.800\n that such leaders will come to power.\n\n29:34.800 --> 29:36.760\n It's hard and you can't ask all the right questions\n\n29:36.760 --> 29:39.400\n and there is a legal hazard if you know things\n\n29:39.400 --> 29:40.760\n at certain times.\n\n29:40.760 --> 29:42.920\n But I think you can, back to your point on hiring,\n\n29:42.920 --> 29:45.680\n you can hire people who will do that in their domains.\n\n29:45.680 --> 29:47.440\n And then you have to trust that when they think\n\n29:47.440 --> 29:49.440\n it's something that's a question you need to ask,\n\n29:49.440 --> 29:51.280\n they'll pass that on to you.\n\n29:51.280 --> 29:54.160\n This is why it's not a good idea to have loyalists\n\n29:54.160 --> 29:57.000\n because loyalists will shield you from things.\n\n29:57.000 --> 29:59.560\n It's a good idea to have people of integrity\n\n29:59.560 --> 30:01.880\n who you can rely on and who you think will ask\n\n30:01.880 --> 30:03.960\n those right questions and then pass that down\n\n30:03.960 --> 30:05.280\n through their organization.\n\n30:06.960 --> 30:10.240\n What's inspiring to you, what's insightful to you\n\n30:10.240 --> 30:12.800\n about several of the presidencies\n\n30:12.800 --> 30:14.920\n throughout the recent decades?\n\n30:14.920 --> 30:16.480\n Is there somebody that stands out to you\n\n30:16.480 --> 30:19.760\n that's interesting and sort of in your study\n\n30:19.760 --> 30:21.420\n of how the office has changed?\n\n30:21.420 --> 30:25.300\n Well, Bill Clinton is one of the most fascinating figures.\n\n30:25.300 --> 30:26.820\n Why can't I, I apologize.\n\n30:26.820 --> 30:28.580\n Bill Clinton just puts a smile on my face\n\n30:28.580 --> 30:30.420\n every time somebody mentions him at this point.\n\n30:30.420 --> 30:31.700\n I don't know why.\n\n30:31.700 --> 30:33.500\n I guess it's charisma, I suppose.\n\n30:33.500 --> 30:36.340\n Well, and he's a unique individual,\n\n30:36.340 --> 30:41.340\n but he fascinates me because he's a figure\n\n30:41.660 --> 30:45.660\n of such enormous talent and enormous appetite\n\n30:45.660 --> 30:50.660\n and such little self control and such extremes.\n\n30:50.660 --> 30:53.140\n And I think it's not just that he tells us\n\n30:53.140 --> 30:53.980\n something about the presidency,\n\n30:53.980 --> 30:56.180\n he tells us something about our society.\n\n30:56.180 --> 30:58.980\n American society, this is not new to our time,\n\n30:58.980 --> 31:02.700\n is filled with enormous reservoirs of talent and creativity.\n\n31:02.700 --> 31:05.500\n And those have a bright and a dark side.\n\n31:05.500 --> 31:06.900\n And you see both with Bill Clinton.\n\n31:06.900 --> 31:09.760\n In some ways, he's the mirror of the best and worst\n\n31:09.760 --> 31:10.940\n of our society.\n\n31:10.940 --> 31:13.040\n And maybe that's really what presidents are in the end.\n\n31:13.040 --> 31:14.660\n They're mirrors of our world\n\n31:14.660 --> 31:16.180\n that we get the government we deserve,\n\n31:16.180 --> 31:18.060\n we get the leaders we deserve.\n\n31:18.060 --> 31:20.220\n I wish we embraced that a little bit more.\n\n31:20.220 --> 31:22.460\n A lot of people criticize Donald Trump\n\n31:22.460 --> 31:24.740\n for certain human qualities that he has.\n\n31:24.740 --> 31:27.040\n A lot of people criticize Bill Clinton\n\n31:27.040 --> 31:28.580\n for certain human qualities.\n\n31:28.580 --> 31:30.940\n I wish we kind of embraced the chaos of that.\n\n31:32.140 --> 31:35.460\n Because he does, you're right, in some sense represent,\n\n31:35.460 --> 31:39.740\n I mean, he doesn't represent the greatest ideal of America,\n\n31:39.740 --> 31:43.720\n but the flawed aspect of human nature is what he represents.\n\n31:43.720 --> 31:45.300\n And that's the beautiful thing about America,\n\n31:45.300 --> 31:49.740\n the diversity of this land with the mix of it,\n\n31:49.740 --> 31:53.660\n the corruption within capitalism,\n\n31:53.660 --> 31:56.800\n the beauty of capitalism, the innovation,\n\n31:56.800 --> 31:57.760\n all those kinds of things,\n\n31:57.760 --> 32:01.620\n the people that start from nothing and create everything,\n\n32:01.620 --> 32:04.380\n the Elon Musk's of the world and the Bill Gates and so on.\n\n32:04.380 --> 32:08.240\n But also the people, Bernie Mados and all,\n\n32:08.240 --> 32:11.620\n as the Me Too movement has showed the multitude of creeps\n\n32:11.620 --> 32:15.200\n that apparently permeate the entirety of our system.\n\n32:15.200 --> 32:20.200\n So I don't know, there is something, there is some sense\n\n32:21.020 --> 32:24.600\n in which we put our president on a pedestal,\n\n32:24.600 --> 32:29.600\n which actually creates a fake human being.\n\n32:30.180 --> 32:33.220\n Like the standard we hold them to\n\n32:33.220 --> 32:36.620\n is forcing the fake politicians to come to power\n\n32:36.620 --> 32:39.140\n versus the authentic one, which is in some sense,\n\n32:39.140 --> 32:42.740\n the promise of Donald Trump is like,\n\n32:42.740 --> 32:46.420\n it's a definitive statement of authenticity.\n\n32:46.420 --> 32:50.540\n It's like, this is the opposite of the fake politician.\n\n32:50.540 --> 32:52.580\n It's whatever else you wanna say about him\n\n32:52.580 --> 32:55.880\n is there's the chaos that's unlike anything else\n\n32:55.880 --> 32:57.520\n that came before.\n\n32:57.520 --> 33:00.560\n One thing, and this is a particular maybe preference\n\n33:00.560 --> 33:03.300\n and quirk of mine, but I really admire,\n\n33:03.300 --> 33:05.400\n maybe I'm romanticizing the past again,\n\n33:05.400 --> 33:07.500\n but I romanticize the presidents\n\n33:07.500 --> 33:09.300\n that were students of history.\n\n33:09.300 --> 33:14.300\n They were almost like king philosophers,\n\n33:17.620 --> 33:22.620\n that made speeches that reverberated through decades after.\n\n33:26.860 --> 33:28.780\n Using the words of those presidents,\n\n33:28.780 --> 33:30.580\n whether written by them or not,\n\n33:30.580 --> 33:32.520\n we tell the story of America.\n\n33:33.460 --> 33:37.740\n And I don't know, even Obama has been an exceptionally good,\n\n33:37.740 --> 33:40.320\n as far as I know, I apologize if I'm incorrect on this,\n\n33:40.320 --> 33:42.260\n but from everything I've seen,\n\n33:42.260 --> 33:44.560\n he was a very deep scholar of history.\n\n33:45.740 --> 33:48.100\n And I really admire that.\n\n33:48.100 --> 33:53.100\n Is that through the history of the office of the presidency,\n\n33:53.520 --> 33:55.940\n is that just your own preference\n\n33:55.940 --> 33:58.080\n or is that supposed to come with the job?\n\n33:58.080 --> 34:00.020\n Are you supposed to be a student of history?\n\n34:00.020 --> 34:02.100\n I think, I mean, I'm obviously biased as a historian,\n\n34:02.100 --> 34:03.740\n but I do think it comes with the job.\n\n34:03.740 --> 34:08.620\n Every president I've studied had a serious interest\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:09.460\n in history.\n\n34:09.460 --> 34:13.180\n Now, how they pursued that interest would vary.\n\n34:13.180 --> 34:16.560\n Obama was more bookish, more academic.\n\n34:16.560 --> 34:18.540\n So was George W. Bush in strange ways.\n\n34:18.540 --> 34:20.180\n George H. W. Bush was less so,\n\n34:20.180 --> 34:22.180\n but George H. W. Bush loved to talk to people.\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:24.380\n So he would talk to historians, right?\n\n34:24.380 --> 34:27.220\n Ronald Reagan loved movies\n\n34:27.220 --> 34:30.020\n and movies were an insight into history for him.\n\n34:30.020 --> 34:32.900\n He likes to watch movies about another time.\n\n34:32.900 --> 34:34.740\n It wasn't always the best of history,\n\n34:34.740 --> 34:35.920\n but he was interested\n\n34:35.920 --> 34:38.700\n in what is a fundamental historical question.\n\n34:38.700 --> 34:40.780\n How has our society developed?\n\n34:40.780 --> 34:43.380\n How has it grown and changed over time?\n\n34:43.380 --> 34:46.980\n And how has that change affected who we are today?\n\n34:46.980 --> 34:48.820\n That's the historical question.\n\n34:48.820 --> 34:50.100\n It's really interesting to me.\n\n34:50.100 --> 34:53.620\n I do a lot of work with business leaders and others too.\n\n34:53.620 --> 34:55.940\n You reach a certain point in any career\n\n34:55.940 --> 34:57.660\n and you become a historian\n\n34:57.660 --> 35:00.380\n because you realize that the formulas\n\n35:00.380 --> 35:02.140\n and the technical knowledge that you've gained\n\n35:02.140 --> 35:04.020\n got you to where you are.\n\n35:04.020 --> 35:07.280\n But now your decisions are about human nature.\n\n35:07.280 --> 35:09.420\n Your decisions are about social change\n\n35:09.420 --> 35:12.020\n and they can't be answered technically.\n\n35:12.020 --> 35:15.100\n They can only be answered by studying human beings.\n\n35:15.100 --> 35:15.920\n And what is history?\n\n35:15.920 --> 35:18.220\n It's studying the laboratory of human behavior.\n\n35:19.700 --> 35:21.640\n To sort of play devil's advocate,\n\n35:21.640 --> 35:26.640\n I kind of, especially in the engineering scientific domains,\n\n35:27.820 --> 35:30.340\n I often see history holding us back.\n\n35:30.340 --> 35:34.100\n Sort of the way things were done in the past\n\n35:34.100 --> 35:36.260\n are not necessarily going to hold the key\n\n35:36.260 --> 35:41.260\n to what will progress us into the future.\n\n35:43.060 --> 35:45.820\n Of course, with history in studying human nature,\n\n35:45.820 --> 35:47.980\n it does seem like humans are just the same.\n\n35:49.060 --> 35:51.740\n She has like the same problems over and over.\n\n35:51.740 --> 35:55.580\n So in that sense, it feels like history has all the lessons,\n\n35:55.580 --> 35:56.980\n whether we're talking about wars,\n\n35:56.980 --> 35:58.880\n whether we're talking about corruption,\n\n35:58.880 --> 36:01.100\n whether we're talking about economics.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:04.300\n I think there's a difference between\n\n36:04.300 --> 36:06.620\n history and antiquarianism.\n\n36:06.620 --> 36:10.020\n So antiquarianism, which some people call history,\n\n36:10.020 --> 36:12.000\n is the desire to go back to the past\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:13.040\n or stay stuck in the past.\n\n36:13.040 --> 36:16.000\n So antiquarianism is the desire to have the desk\n\n36:16.000 --> 36:17.300\n that Abraham Lincoln sat at.\n\n36:17.300 --> 36:19.180\n Wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk?\n\n36:19.180 --> 36:20.280\n I'd love to have that desk.\n\n36:20.280 --> 36:22.860\n If I had a few extra million dollars, I'd acquire it.\n\n36:22.860 --> 36:25.640\n So in a way, that's antiquarianism.\n\n36:25.640 --> 36:28.740\n That's trying to capture and hold on to the past.\n\n36:28.740 --> 36:31.980\n The past is a talisman for antiquarians.\n\n36:32.980 --> 36:35.980\n What history is, is the study of change over time.\n\n36:35.980 --> 36:38.260\n That's the real definition of historical study\n\n36:38.260 --> 36:39.860\n and historical thinking.\n\n36:39.860 --> 36:42.200\n And so what we're studying is change.\n\n36:42.200 --> 36:44.400\n And so a historian should never say,\n\n36:45.840 --> 36:47.700\n we have to do things the way we've done them in the past.\n\n36:47.700 --> 36:49.860\n The historian should say, we can't do them\n\n36:49.860 --> 36:51.020\n the way we did them in the past.\n\n36:51.020 --> 36:53.100\n We can't step in the same river twice.\n\n36:53.100 --> 36:56.500\n Every podcast of yours is different from the last one.\n\n36:56.500 --> 36:59.340\n You plan it out and then it goes in its own direction.\n\n37:00.420 --> 37:02.980\n And what are we studying then in history?\n\n37:02.980 --> 37:05.500\n We're studying the patterns of change\n\n37:05.500 --> 37:08.020\n and we're recognizing we're part of a pattern.\n\n37:08.020 --> 37:10.000\n So what I would say to the historian\n\n37:10.000 --> 37:11.280\n who's trying to hold the engineer back,\n\n37:11.280 --> 37:14.820\n I'd say, no, don't tell that engineer not to do this.\n\n37:14.820 --> 37:16.820\n Tell them to understand how this fits\n\n37:16.820 --> 37:20.040\n into the relationship with other engineering products\n\n37:20.040 --> 37:22.100\n and other activities from the past\n\n37:22.100 --> 37:23.620\n that still affect us today.\n\n37:23.620 --> 37:25.620\n For example, any product you produce\n\n37:25.620 --> 37:28.500\n is gonna be used by human beings who have prejudices.\n\n37:28.500 --> 37:30.240\n It's gonna go into an unequal society.\n\n37:30.240 --> 37:32.180\n Don't assume it's gonna go into an equal society.\n\n37:32.180 --> 37:34.660\n Don't assume that when you create a social media site\n\n37:34.660 --> 37:36.220\n that people are going to use it fairly\n\n37:36.220 --> 37:38.900\n and put only truthful things on it.\n\n37:38.900 --> 37:39.740\n We shouldn't be surprised.\n\n37:39.740 --> 37:42.060\n That's where human nature comes in.\n\n37:42.060 --> 37:43.520\n But it's not trying to hold onto the past.\n\n37:43.520 --> 37:45.020\n It's trying to use the knowledge from the past\n\n37:45.020 --> 37:46.940\n to better inform the changes today.\n\n37:48.020 --> 37:50.620\n I have to ask you about George Washington.\n\n37:50.620 --> 37:52.680\n Maybe you have some insights.\n\n37:52.680 --> 37:56.660\n It seems like he's such a fascinating figure\n\n37:56.660 --> 37:58.940\n in the context of the study of power.\n\n37:59.860 --> 38:03.940\n Because I kind of intuitively have come to internalize\n\n38:03.940 --> 38:06.120\n the belief that power corrupts\n\n38:06.120 --> 38:07.780\n and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\n38:07.780 --> 38:08.620\n Yes.\n\n38:11.700 --> 38:15.500\n And sort of like basically in thinking\n\n38:15.500 --> 38:18.540\n that we cannot trust any one individual.\n\n38:18.540 --> 38:20.800\n I can't trust myself with power.\n\n38:20.800 --> 38:22.860\n Nobody can trust anybody with power.\n\n38:22.860 --> 38:24.880\n We have to create institutions and structures\n\n38:24.880 --> 38:27.300\n that prevent us from ever being able\n\n38:27.300 --> 38:29.220\n to amass absolute power.\n\n38:29.220 --> 38:31.540\n And yet, here's a guy, George Washington,\n\n38:31.540 --> 38:34.280\n who seems to, you can correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n38:34.280 --> 38:37.180\n but he seems to give away, relinquish power.\n\n38:37.180 --> 38:39.100\n It feels like George Washington did it\n\n38:40.580 --> 38:43.260\n almost like the purest of ways,\n\n38:43.260 --> 38:46.620\n which is believes in this country,\n\n38:46.620 --> 38:48.660\n but he just believes he's not the person\n\n38:48.660 --> 38:52.980\n to carry it forward.\n\n38:54.020 --> 38:55.460\n What do you make of that?\n\n38:55.460 --> 38:58.640\n What kind of human does it take to give away that power?\n\n38:58.640 --> 39:01.660\n Is there some hopeful message we can carry through\n\n39:01.660 --> 39:05.140\n to the future to elect leaders like that\n\n39:05.140 --> 39:09.580\n or to find friends to hang out with who are like that?\n\n39:09.580 --> 39:10.420\n Like what is that?\n\n39:10.420 --> 39:11.340\n How do you explain that?\n\n39:11.340 --> 39:14.020\n So it's actually the most important thing\n\n39:14.020 --> 39:14.980\n about George Washington.\n\n39:14.980 --> 39:16.660\n It's the right thing to bring up.\n\n39:16.660 --> 39:21.420\n What the historian Gary Wills wrote years ago,\n\n39:21.420 --> 39:22.260\n I'm gonna quote him,\n\n39:22.260 --> 39:23.940\n was that Washington recognized\n\n39:23.940 --> 39:26.660\n that sometimes you get more power by giving it up\n\n39:26.660 --> 39:30.540\n than by trying to hold on to every last piece of it.\n\n39:30.540 --> 39:32.740\n Washington gives up power at the end of the revolution.\n\n39:32.740 --> 39:34.460\n He's successfully carried\n\n39:34.460 --> 39:35.940\n through the revolutionary war aims.\n\n39:35.940 --> 39:38.460\n He's commander of the revolutionary forces\n\n39:38.460 --> 39:40.020\n and he gives up his command.\n\n39:40.020 --> 39:41.180\n And then of course he's president\n\n39:41.180 --> 39:43.340\n and after two terms, he gives up his command.\n\n39:43.340 --> 39:44.180\n What is he doing?\n\n39:44.180 --> 39:46.100\n He's an ambitious person,\n\n39:46.100 --> 39:49.540\n but he's recognizing that the most important currency\n\n39:49.540 --> 39:53.620\n he has for power is his respected status\n\n39:53.620 --> 39:55.420\n as a disinterested statesman.\n\n39:56.580 --> 39:58.580\n That's really what his power is.\n\n39:58.580 --> 40:00.500\n And how does he further that power?\n\n40:00.500 --> 40:03.360\n By showing that he doesn't crave power.\n\n40:04.400 --> 40:05.620\n So he was self aware.\n\n40:05.620 --> 40:06.840\n Very self aware of this\n\n40:06.840 --> 40:10.300\n and very sophisticated in understanding this.\n\n40:10.300 --> 40:14.620\n And I think there are many other leaders who recognize that.\n\n40:14.620 --> 40:19.400\n You can look to, in some ways,\n\n40:19.400 --> 40:20.980\n the story of many of our presidents\n\n40:20.980 --> 40:24.100\n who even before there is a two term limit\n\n40:24.100 --> 40:26.960\n in the constitution, leave after two terms.\n\n40:26.960 --> 40:28.740\n They do that because they recognize\n\n40:28.740 --> 40:31.400\n that their power is the power of being a statesman,\n\n40:32.880 --> 40:34.260\n not of being a president.\n\n40:34.260 --> 40:36.940\n I still wonder what kind of man it takes,\n\n40:36.940 --> 40:39.560\n what kind of human being it takes to do that.\n\n40:39.560 --> 40:43.940\n Because I've been studying Vladimir Putin quite a bit.\n\n40:43.940 --> 40:44.780\n Right.\n\n40:44.780 --> 40:49.780\n And he's still, I believe he still has popular support\n\n40:51.500 --> 40:54.200\n that that's not fully manipulated.\n\n40:54.200 --> 40:55.940\n Because I know a lot of people in Russia\n\n40:55.940 --> 40:59.100\n and actually almost the entirety of my family in Russia\n\n40:59.100 --> 41:01.140\n are big supporters of Putin.\n\n41:01.140 --> 41:03.460\n And everybody I talk to sort of,\n\n41:03.460 --> 41:05.460\n that's not just like on social media.\n\n41:05.460 --> 41:06.300\n Right.\n\n41:06.300 --> 41:08.140\n Like the people that live in Russia\n\n41:08.140 --> 41:10.980\n seem to support him.\n\n41:10.980 --> 41:15.980\n It feels like this will be in a George Washington way.\n\n41:16.540 --> 41:19.820\n Now will be the time that Putin,\n\n41:19.820 --> 41:22.580\n just like Yeltsin, could relinquish power.\n\n41:22.580 --> 41:25.860\n And thereby, in the eyes of Russians,\n\n41:25.860 --> 41:29.580\n become, in like the long arc of history,\n\n41:29.580 --> 41:31.620\n be viewed as a great leader.\n\n41:31.620 --> 41:34.500\n You look at the economic growth of Russia,\n\n41:34.500 --> 41:36.220\n you look at the rescue from the collapse\n\n41:36.220 --> 41:39.460\n of the Soviet Union and Russia finding its footing,\n\n41:39.460 --> 41:44.020\n and then relinquishing power in a way that perhaps,\n\n41:44.020 --> 41:48.080\n if Russia succeeds, forms a truly democratic state.\n\n41:48.080 --> 41:49.940\n This would be how Putin can become\n\n41:49.940 --> 41:52.660\n one of the great leaders in Russian history,\n\n41:52.660 --> 41:55.860\n at least in the context of the 21st century.\n\n41:55.860 --> 41:59.140\n I think there are two reasons why this is really hard\n\n41:59.140 --> 42:01.420\n for Putin and for others.\n\n42:01.420 --> 42:05.500\n One is the trappings of power are very seductive,\n\n42:05.500 --> 42:07.280\n as you said before, they're corrupting.\n\n42:07.280 --> 42:09.380\n This is a real problem, right?\n\n42:09.380 --> 42:10.500\n If it's in the business context,\n\n42:10.500 --> 42:13.060\n you don't wanna give up that private jet.\n\n42:13.060 --> 42:14.500\n If it's in Putin's context,\n\n42:14.500 --> 42:15.940\n it's billions of dollars every year\n\n42:15.940 --> 42:19.520\n that he's able to take for himself or give to his friends.\n\n42:19.520 --> 42:20.780\n It's not that he'll be poor if he leaves,\n\n42:20.780 --> 42:21.940\n he'll still be rich,\n\n42:21.940 --> 42:23.980\n and he has billions of dollars stored away,\n\n42:23.980 --> 42:26.460\n but he won't be able to get the new billions.\n\n42:26.460 --> 42:27.420\n And so that's part of it,\n\n42:27.420 --> 42:30.300\n the trappings of power are a big deal.\n\n42:30.300 --> 42:32.660\n And then second, in Putin's case in particular,\n\n42:32.660 --> 42:34.960\n he has to be worried about what happens next.\n\n42:34.960 --> 42:35.860\n Will he be tried?\n\n42:35.860 --> 42:38.260\n Will someone try to come and arrest him?\n\n42:38.260 --> 42:41.060\n Will someone try to come and assassinate him?\n\n42:41.060 --> 42:44.900\n Washington recognized that leaving early\n\n42:44.900 --> 42:48.780\n limited the corruption and limited the enemies that you made.\n\n42:48.780 --> 42:50.740\n And so it was a strategic choice.\n\n42:50.740 --> 42:53.100\n Putin is at this point bringing power too long.\n\n42:53.100 --> 42:55.420\n And this comes back to your core insight.\n\n42:55.420 --> 42:57.960\n It's a cliche, but it's true, power corrupts.\n\n42:57.960 --> 42:59.320\n No one should have power for too long.\n\n42:59.320 --> 43:00.860\n This was one of the best insights\n\n43:00.860 --> 43:02.580\n the founders of the United States had,\n\n43:02.580 --> 43:04.740\n that power was to be held for a short time\n\n43:04.740 --> 43:07.160\n as a fiduciary responsibility,\n\n43:07.160 --> 43:08.800\n not as something you owned, right?\n\n43:08.800 --> 43:10.220\n This is the problem with monarchy,\n\n43:10.220 --> 43:12.820\n with aristocracy, that you own power, right?\n\n43:12.820 --> 43:16.320\n We don't own power, we're holding it in trust.\n\n43:17.840 --> 43:22.060\n Yeah, there's some probably like very specific\n\n43:22.060 --> 43:24.980\n psychological study of how many years it takes\n\n43:24.980 --> 43:28.600\n for you to forget that you can't own power.\n\n43:28.600 --> 43:29.440\n That's right.\n\n43:29.440 --> 43:32.680\n That could be a much more rigorous discussion\n\n43:32.680 --> 43:35.260\n about the length of terms that are appropriate,\n\n43:35.260 --> 43:37.260\n but really there's an amount,\n\n43:37.260 --> 43:39.380\n like Stalin had power for 30 years,\n\n43:39.380 --> 43:42.720\n like Putin is pushing those that many years already.\n\n43:44.100 --> 43:46.160\n There's a certain point where you forget\n\n43:46.160 --> 43:48.420\n the person you were before you took the power.\n\n43:48.420 --> 43:49.260\n That's right.\n\n43:49.260 --> 43:52.100\n You forget to be humble in the face of this responsibility\n\n43:52.100 --> 43:55.060\n and then there's no going back.\n\n43:55.060 --> 43:55.900\n That's right.\n\n43:55.900 --> 43:57.580\n And that's how dictators are born.\n\n43:57.580 --> 44:01.780\n That's how the evil like authoritarians become evil\n\n44:01.780 --> 44:05.880\n or let's not use the word evil,\n\n44:05.880 --> 44:08.600\n but counterproductive, destructive\n\n44:08.600 --> 44:11.720\n to the ideal that they initially\n\n44:11.720 --> 44:13.340\n probably came to office with.\n\n44:13.340 --> 44:14.180\n That's right.\n\n44:14.180 --> 44:15.020\n That's right.\n\n44:15.020 --> 44:16.360\n One of the core historical insights\n\n44:16.360 --> 44:18.340\n is people should move jobs.\n\n44:19.960 --> 44:21.720\n And this applies for CEOs probably.\n\n44:21.720 --> 44:22.700\n Absolutely.\n\n44:22.700 --> 44:24.320\n They can go become CEO somewhere else,\n\n44:24.320 --> 44:26.520\n but don't stay CEO one place too long.\n\n44:26.520 --> 44:27.860\n It's a problem with startups, right?\n\n44:27.860 --> 44:29.880\n The founder, you can have a brilliant founder\n\n44:29.880 --> 44:31.460\n and that founder doesn't want to let go.\n\n44:31.460 --> 44:32.300\n Yeah.\n\n44:32.300 --> 44:33.400\n Right, it's the same issue.\n\n44:33.400 --> 44:35.800\n At the same time, I mean, this is where Elon Musk\n\n44:35.800 --> 44:40.800\n and a few others like Larry Page and Sergey Brin\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.900\n that stayed for quite a long time\n\n44:42.900 --> 44:45.200\n and they actually were the beacon.\n\n44:45.200 --> 44:48.920\n They, on their shoulders, carried the dream of the company\n\n44:48.920 --> 44:51.120\n where everybody else doubted.\n\n44:51.120 --> 44:54.660\n But that seems to be the exception versus the rule.\n\n44:54.660 --> 44:57.640\n Well, and even Sergey, for example, has stepped back.\n\n44:57.640 --> 44:59.580\n He plays less of a day to day role\n\n44:59.580 --> 45:01.880\n and is not running Google in the way he did.\n\n45:01.880 --> 45:04.480\n But the interesting thing is he stepped back\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:07.640\n in a quite tragic way from what I've seen,\n\n45:07.640 --> 45:12.400\n which is, I think Google's mission, initial mission\n\n45:12.400 --> 45:15.560\n of making the world's information accessible to everybody\n\n45:15.560 --> 45:17.880\n is one of the most beautiful missions of any company\n\n45:17.880 --> 45:18.920\n in the history of the world.\n\n45:18.920 --> 45:22.520\n I think it's what Google has done with the search engine\n\n45:22.520 --> 45:25.500\n and other efforts that are similar,\n\n45:25.500 --> 45:29.120\n like scanning a lot of books, it's just incredible.\n\n45:29.120 --> 45:31.080\n It's similar to Wikipedia.\n\n45:32.760 --> 45:37.760\n But what he said was that it's not the same company anymore.\n\n45:38.040 --> 45:41.020\n And I know maybe I'm reading too much into it\n\n45:41.020 --> 45:43.480\n because it's more maybe practically saying\n\n45:43.480 --> 45:45.280\n just the size of the company is much larger,\n\n45:45.280 --> 45:47.120\n the kind of leadership that's required.\n\n45:47.120 --> 45:50.080\n But at the same time, they changed the model\n\n45:50.080 --> 45:54.320\n from don't be evil to it's becoming corporatized\n\n45:54.320 --> 45:56.920\n and all those kinds of things and it's sad.\n\n45:56.920 --> 45:59.280\n There also are cycles, right?\n\n45:59.280 --> 46:01.160\n History is about cycles, right?\n\n46:01.160 --> 46:05.040\n There are cycles to life, there are cycles to organizations.\n\n46:05.040 --> 46:05.880\n It's sad.\n\n46:05.880 --> 46:08.200\n I mean, it's sad Steve Jobs leaving Apple\n\n46:08.200 --> 46:10.700\n by passing away, sad.\n\n46:11.520 --> 46:14.760\n You know, what the future of SpaceX and Tesla looks like\n\n46:14.760 --> 46:16.920\n without Elon Musk is quite sad.\n\n46:16.920 --> 46:18.640\n It's very possible that those companies\n\n46:18.640 --> 46:20.360\n become something very different.\n\n46:20.360 --> 46:24.360\n They become something much more like corporate\n\n46:24.360 --> 46:28.920\n and stale, yeah.\n\n46:28.920 --> 46:31.680\n So maybe most of the progress is made through cycles.\n\n46:31.680 --> 46:33.320\n Maybe a new Elon Musk comes along\n\n46:33.320 --> 46:35.500\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n46:35.500 --> 46:39.560\n But it does seem that the American system of government\n\n46:39.560 --> 46:44.560\n has built into it the cycling that makes it effective\n\n46:46.080 --> 46:47.760\n and it makes it last very long.\n\n46:47.760 --> 46:50.040\n It lasts a very long time, right?\n\n46:50.040 --> 46:53.340\n It continues to excel and lead the world.\n\n46:53.340 --> 46:55.280\n Sure, sure.\n\n46:55.280 --> 46:56.320\n And let's hope it continues to.\n\n46:56.320 --> 47:00.040\n No, I mean, we're into a third century\n\n47:00.040 --> 47:03.680\n and democracies on this scale rarely last that long.\n\n47:03.680 --> 47:07.320\n So that's a point of pride, but it also means\n\n47:07.320 --> 47:09.240\n we need to be attentive to keep our house in order\n\n47:09.240 --> 47:13.000\n because it's not inevitable that this experiment continues.\n\n47:14.240 --> 47:17.160\n Now it's important to meditate on that actually.\n\n47:17.160 --> 47:20.320\n You've mentioned that FDR, Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\n47:20.320 --> 47:24.480\n is one of the great leaders in American history.\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:25.560\n Why is that?\n\n47:25.560 --> 47:29.600\n Franklin Roosevelt had the power of empathy.\n\n47:29.600 --> 47:32.320\n No leader that I've ever studied or been around\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:35.480\n or spent any time reading about was able to connect\n\n47:35.480 --> 47:37.800\n with people who were so different from himself\n\n47:37.800 --> 47:39.200\n as Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n47:39.200 --> 47:40.960\n He came from the most elite family.\n\n47:40.960 --> 47:43.260\n He never had to work for a paycheck in his life.\n\n47:43.260 --> 47:44.900\n When he was president, he was still collecting\n\n47:44.900 --> 47:46.640\n an allowance from his mom.\n\n47:46.640 --> 47:49.660\n I mean, you couldn't be more elite than Franklin Roosevelt,\n\n47:49.660 --> 47:52.280\n but he authentically connected.\n\n47:52.280 --> 47:54.440\n This was not propaganda.\n\n47:54.440 --> 47:57.780\n He was able to feel the pain and understand the lives\n\n47:57.780 --> 48:00.760\n of some of the most destitute Americans\n\n48:00.760 --> 48:02.040\n in other parts of the country.\n\n48:02.040 --> 48:02.880\n It's interesting.\n\n48:02.880 --> 48:06.360\n So through one of the hardest economic periods\n\n48:06.360 --> 48:08.480\n of American history, he was able to feel the pain.\n\n48:08.480 --> 48:10.520\n He was able to, the number of immigrants\n\n48:10.520 --> 48:13.240\n I read oral histories from or who have written themselves,\n\n48:13.240 --> 48:15.200\n Saul Bellow is one example, the great novelist\n\n48:15.200 --> 48:17.480\n who talk about how as immigrants to the US,\n\n48:17.480 --> 48:19.360\n Saul Bellow was a Russian Jewish immigrant.\n\n48:19.360 --> 48:21.600\n He said, growing up in Chicago, politicians were all trying\n\n48:21.600 --> 48:22.440\n to steal from us.\n\n48:22.440 --> 48:25.200\n I didn't think any of them cared until I heard FDR.\n\n48:25.200 --> 48:26.980\n And I knew he spoke to me.\n\n48:27.920 --> 48:31.520\n And I think part of it was FDR really tried\n\n48:31.520 --> 48:32.480\n to understand people.\n\n48:32.480 --> 48:33.680\n That's the first thing, he was humble enough\n\n48:33.680 --> 48:34.960\n to try to do that.\n\n48:34.960 --> 48:36.520\n But second, he had a talent for that.\n\n48:36.520 --> 48:38.900\n And it's hard to know exactly what it was,\n\n48:38.900 --> 48:40.600\n but he had a talent for putting himself,\n\n48:40.600 --> 48:43.740\n imagining himself in someone else's shoes.\n\n48:43.740 --> 48:48.200\n What stands out to you as important?\n\n48:48.200 --> 48:51.720\n I mean, so he was, he went through the great depression.\n\n48:51.720 --> 48:54.880\n The, so the new deal, which some people criticize,\n\n48:54.880 --> 48:57.760\n some people see, I mean, it's funny to look at some\n\n48:57.760 --> 49:02.760\n of these policies and their long ripple effects.\n\n49:03.400 --> 49:08.040\n But at the time, it's some of the most innovative policies\n\n49:08.040 --> 49:09.320\n in the history of America.\n\n49:09.320 --> 49:12.300\n You could say they're ultimately not good for America,\n\n49:12.300 --> 49:16.000\n but they're nevertheless hold within them very rich\n\n49:16.000 --> 49:17.560\n and important lessons.\n\n49:17.560 --> 49:20.680\n But the new deal, obviously World War II,\n\n49:20.680 --> 49:23.400\n that entire process, is there something that stands out\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:28.400\n to you as a particularly great moment that made FDR?\n\n49:30.080 --> 49:34.860\n Yes, I think what FDR does from his first 100 days\n\n49:34.860 --> 49:38.840\n in office forward, and this begins with his fireside chats,\n\n49:38.840 --> 49:43.400\n is he helps Americans to see that they're all in it together.\n\n49:43.400 --> 49:46.720\n And that's by creating hope and creating a sense\n\n49:46.720 --> 49:49.320\n of common suffering and common mission.\n\n49:49.320 --> 49:51.200\n It's not offering simple solutions.\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:52.960\n One of the lessons from FDR is,\n\n49:52.960 --> 49:54.320\n if you wanna bring people together,\n\n49:54.320 --> 49:56.160\n don't offer a simple solution.\n\n49:56.160 --> 49:57.920\n Because as soon as I offer a simple solution,\n\n49:57.920 --> 50:00.080\n I have people for it and against it.\n\n50:00.080 --> 50:00.960\n Don't do that.\n\n50:00.960 --> 50:04.040\n Explain the problem, frame the problem,\n\n50:04.040 --> 50:05.940\n and then give people a mission.\n\n50:05.940 --> 50:10.200\n So Roosevelt's first radio address in March of 1933,\n\n50:10.200 --> 50:12.400\n the banking system is collapsing.\n\n50:12.400 --> 50:13.600\n And we can't imagine it, right?\n\n50:13.600 --> 50:16.400\n Banks were closing and you couldn't get your money out.\n\n50:16.400 --> 50:17.960\n Your life savings would be lost, right?\n\n50:17.960 --> 50:20.440\n We can't imagine that happening in our world today.\n\n50:20.440 --> 50:22.520\n He comes on the radio, he takes five minutes\n\n50:22.520 --> 50:24.360\n to explain how banking works.\n\n50:24.360 --> 50:26.560\n Most people didn't understand how banking worked, right?\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:28.400\n They don't actually hold your money in a vault.\n\n50:28.400 --> 50:30.320\n They lend it out to someone else.\n\n50:30.320 --> 50:33.520\n And then he explains why if you go and take your money\n\n50:33.520 --> 50:35.000\n out of the bank and put it in your mattress,\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:36.840\n you're making it worse for yourself.\n\n50:36.840 --> 50:38.400\n He explains this.\n\n50:38.400 --> 50:40.960\n And then he says, I don't have a solution,\n\n50:40.960 --> 50:42.240\n but here's what I'm gonna do.\n\n50:42.240 --> 50:46.680\n I'm gonna send in government officers to examine the banks\n\n50:46.680 --> 50:48.520\n and show you the books on the banks.\n\n50:48.520 --> 50:50.520\n And I want you to help me by going\n\n50:50.520 --> 50:52.400\n and putting your money back in the bank.\n\n50:52.400 --> 50:54.160\n We're all gonna do this together.\n\n50:54.160 --> 50:56.680\n No simple solution, no ideological statement,\n\n50:56.680 --> 50:58.420\n but a sense of common mission.\n\n50:58.420 --> 51:00.180\n Let's go out and do this together.\n\n51:00.180 --> 51:03.420\n When you read as I have so many of these oral histories\n\n51:03.420 --> 51:06.000\n and memoirs for people who lived through that period,\n\n51:06.000 --> 51:08.400\n many of them disagreed with some of his policies.\n\n51:08.400 --> 51:10.260\n Many of them thought he was too close to Jews\n\n51:10.260 --> 51:11.600\n and they didn't like the fact he had a woman\n\n51:11.600 --> 51:15.560\n in his cabinet and all that, but they felt he cared.\n\n51:15.560 --> 51:18.300\n And they felt they were part of some common mission.\n\n51:18.300 --> 51:20.520\n And when they talk about their experience fighting\n\n51:20.520 --> 51:22.980\n in World War II, whether in Europe or Asia,\n\n51:22.980 --> 51:24.380\n it was that that prepared them.\n\n51:24.380 --> 51:26.040\n They knew what it meant to be an American\n\n51:26.040 --> 51:27.960\n when they were over there.\n\n51:27.960 --> 51:30.560\n So that to me is a model of leadership.\n\n51:30.560 --> 51:33.520\n And I think that's as possible today as it's ever been.\n\n51:33.520 --> 51:37.280\n So you think it's possible, like I was going to ask this,\n\n51:37.280 --> 51:41.760\n again, it may be a very shallow view,\n\n51:41.760 --> 51:45.200\n but it feels like this country is more divided\n\n51:45.200 --> 51:48.560\n than it has been in recent history.\n\n51:48.560 --> 51:51.520\n Perhaps the social media and all those kinds of things\n\n51:51.520 --> 51:54.300\n are merely revealing the division\n\n51:54.300 --> 51:56.360\n as opposed to creating the division.\n\n51:56.360 --> 52:00.080\n But is it possible to have a leader\n\n52:00.080 --> 52:03.880\n that unites in the same way that FDR did without,\n\n52:03.880 --> 52:06.280\n well, we're living through a pandemic.\n\n52:06.280 --> 52:09.420\n This is already, so like, I was going to say\n\n52:09.420 --> 52:12.560\n without suffering, but this is economic suffering.\n\n52:12.560 --> 52:14.240\n A huge number of people have lost their job.\n\n52:14.240 --> 52:18.260\n So is it possible to have, is there one a hunger?\n\n52:18.260 --> 52:21.320\n Is there a possibility to have an FDR style leader\n\n52:21.320 --> 52:22.920\n who unites?\n\n52:22.920 --> 52:25.680\n Yes, I think that is what President Biden is trying.\n\n52:25.680 --> 52:27.680\n I'm not saying he'll succeed,\n\n52:27.680 --> 52:29.420\n but I think that's what he's trying to do.\n\n52:29.420 --> 52:31.760\n The way you do this is you do not allow yourself\n\n52:31.760 --> 52:35.100\n to be captured by your opponents in Congress\n\n52:35.100 --> 52:36.080\n or somewhere else.\n\n52:36.080 --> 52:38.000\n FDR had a lot of opponents in Congress.\n\n52:38.000 --> 52:39.960\n He had a lot of opponents in politics,\n\n52:39.960 --> 52:41.840\n governors and others who didn't like him.\n\n52:41.840 --> 52:44.040\n Herbert Hoover was still around\n\n52:44.040 --> 52:47.200\n and still accusing FDR of being a conspiratist\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:48.240\n and all these other things.\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:52.100\n So you don't allow yourself to be captured\n\n52:52.100 --> 52:53.380\n by the leaders of the other side.\n\n52:53.380 --> 52:55.760\n You go over their heads to the people.\n\n52:55.760 --> 52:59.340\n And so today, the way to do this is to explain to people\n\n52:59.340 --> 53:01.700\n and empathize with the suffering and dislocation\n\n53:01.700 --> 53:03.600\n and difficulties they're dealing with\n\n53:03.600 --> 53:05.860\n and show that you're trying to help them.\n\n53:05.860 --> 53:08.760\n Not an easy solution, not a simple statement,\n\n53:08.760 --> 53:11.340\n but here are some things we can all do together.\n\n53:11.340 --> 53:13.620\n That's why I think infrastructure makes a lot of sense.\n\n53:13.620 --> 53:15.960\n It's what FDR invested into, right?\n\n53:15.960 --> 53:17.400\n FDR built Hoover Dam.\n\n53:17.400 --> 53:20.600\n Hoover Dam turned the lights on for young Lyndon Johnson\n\n53:20.600 --> 53:22.720\n who grew up outside of Austin, right?\n\n53:22.720 --> 53:25.720\n FDR was the one who invested in road construction\n\n53:25.720 --> 53:28.480\n that was then continued by Dwight Eisenhower,\n\n53:28.480 --> 53:31.800\n by a Republican with the interstate highway system, right?\n\n53:31.800 --> 53:34.480\n FDR invested through the WPA in building thousands\n\n53:34.480 --> 53:37.020\n of schools in our country, planting trees.\n\n53:37.020 --> 53:40.460\n That's the kind of work that can bring people together.\n\n53:40.460 --> 53:42.600\n You don't have to be a Democrat or a Republican to say,\n\n53:42.600 --> 53:45.380\n you know what, we'd be a lot better off in my community\n\n53:45.380 --> 53:47.540\n if we had better infrastructure today.\n\n53:47.540 --> 53:48.440\n I wanna be a part of that.\n\n53:48.440 --> 53:49.960\n Oh, well, maybe I can get a job doing that.\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:52.800\n Maybe my company can benefit from that.\n\n53:52.800 --> 53:54.560\n You bring people together and that way\n\n53:54.560 --> 53:56.520\n it becomes a common mission,\n\n53:56.520 --> 53:59.200\n even if we have different ideological positions.\n\n53:59.200 --> 54:00.120\n Yeah, it's funny.\n\n54:01.560 --> 54:03.760\n When I first heard Joe Biden,\n\n54:05.100 --> 54:08.560\n many years ago, I think he ran for president against Obama.\n\n54:08.560 --> 54:09.400\n That's correct.\n\n54:10.920 --> 54:13.800\n Before I heard him speak, I really liked him.\n\n54:13.800 --> 54:15.560\n But once I heard him speak,\n\n54:15.560 --> 54:17.800\n I started liking him less and less.\n\n54:17.800 --> 54:21.000\n And it speaks to something interesting,\n\n54:21.000 --> 54:22.680\n where it's hard to put into words\n\n54:22.680 --> 54:24.940\n why you connect with people.\n\n54:24.940 --> 54:27.400\n The empathy that you mentioned in FDR,\n\n54:27.400 --> 54:31.240\n you have these bad, pardon the French, motherfuckers\n\n54:31.240 --> 54:33.900\n like Teddy Roosevelt that connect with you.\n\n54:33.900 --> 54:35.920\n There's something just powerful.\n\n54:35.920 --> 54:39.000\n And with Joe Biden, I wanna really like him.\n\n54:39.000 --> 54:41.740\n And there's something not quite there\n\n54:41.740 --> 54:45.500\n where it feels like he doesn't quite know my pain,\n\n54:45.500 --> 54:49.600\n even though he, on paper, is exactly,\n\n54:49.600 --> 54:50.980\n he knows the pain of the people\n\n54:50.980 --> 54:52.440\n and there's something not connecting.\n\n54:52.440 --> 54:53.800\n And it's hard to explain.\n\n54:53.800 --> 54:55.160\n It's hard to put into words.\n\n54:55.160 --> 54:57.640\n And it makes me not,\n\n55:00.040 --> 55:01.680\n as an engineer and scientist,\n\n55:01.680 --> 55:04.680\n it makes me not feel good about presidencies\n\n55:04.680 --> 55:08.760\n because it makes me feel like it's more art than science.\n\n55:08.760 --> 55:09.600\n It is an art.\n\n55:09.600 --> 55:11.320\n And I think it's exactly an art\n\n55:11.320 --> 55:13.280\n for the reasons you laid out, it's aesthetic.\n\n55:13.280 --> 55:14.840\n It's about feeling, it's about emotion,\n\n55:14.840 --> 55:16.180\n all the things that we can't engineer.\n\n55:16.180 --> 55:18.960\n We've tried for centuries to engineer emotion.\n\n55:18.960 --> 55:19.880\n We're never gonna do it.\n\n55:19.880 --> 55:20.720\n Don't try it.\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:21.680\n I'm a parent of teenagers.\n\n55:21.680 --> 55:24.080\n Don't even try to explain emotion.\n\n55:24.080 --> 55:26.120\n But you hit on the key point\n\n55:26.120 --> 55:27.160\n and the key challenge for Biden.\n\n55:27.160 --> 55:28.860\n He's gotta find the right words.\n\n55:28.860 --> 55:32.400\n It's not finding the words to bullshit people.\n\n55:32.400 --> 55:34.360\n It's finding the words to help express.\n\n55:34.360 --> 55:36.640\n We've all felt empowered and felt good.\n\n55:36.640 --> 55:38.640\n When someone uses words\n\n55:38.640 --> 55:41.060\n that put into words what we're feeling,\n\n55:41.060 --> 55:41.900\n that's what he needs.\n\n55:41.900 --> 55:42.960\n That's the job of a leader.\n\n55:42.960 --> 55:44.560\n And there's certain words,\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:47.020\n I haven't heard many politicians use those words,\n\n55:47.020 --> 55:49.760\n but there's certain words that make you forget\n\n55:49.760 --> 55:54.760\n that you're for immigration or against immigration.\n\n55:54.840 --> 55:57.880\n Make you forget whether you're for wars and against wars.\n\n55:57.880 --> 56:00.600\n Make you forget about the bickering\n\n56:00.600 --> 56:04.320\n and somehow inspire you, elevate you\n\n56:04.320 --> 56:07.040\n to believe in the greatness that this country could be.\n\n56:07.040 --> 56:08.200\n Yes.\n\n56:08.200 --> 56:11.240\n In that same way, the reason I moved to Austin,\n\n56:11.240 --> 56:15.240\n it's funny to say, I just heard words\n\n56:15.240 --> 56:17.520\n from people, from friends,\n\n56:17.520 --> 56:21.840\n where they're excited by the possibility of the future here.\n\n56:21.840 --> 56:24.760\n I wasn't thinking like, what's the right thing to do?\n\n56:24.760 --> 56:26.200\n What's the strategic,\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:28.080\n cause I wanna launch a business.\n\n56:28.080 --> 56:30.040\n There's a lot of arguments for San Francisco\n\n56:30.040 --> 56:32.360\n or maybe staying in Boston in my case,\n\n56:32.360 --> 56:37.080\n but there's this excitement that was beyond reason.\n\n56:37.080 --> 56:38.040\n That was emotional.\n\n56:38.040 --> 56:38.880\n Yes, yes.\n\n56:38.880 --> 56:40.800\n And that's what it seems like.\n\n56:40.800 --> 56:43.840\n That's what builds, that's what great leaders do,\n\n56:43.840 --> 56:45.200\n but that's what builds countries.\n\n56:45.200 --> 56:47.720\n That's what builds great businesses.\n\n56:47.720 --> 56:48.560\n That's right.\n\n56:48.560 --> 56:50.160\n And it's what people say about Austin,\n\n56:50.160 --> 56:51.640\n for example, all the time.\n\n56:51.640 --> 56:54.080\n A talented people who come here like yourself.\n\n56:54.080 --> 56:55.240\n And here's the interesting thing.\n\n56:55.240 --> 56:56.760\n No one person creates that.\n\n56:56.760 --> 56:58.200\n The words emerge.\n\n56:58.200 --> 57:00.240\n And part of what FDR understood,\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:03.200\n you've got to find the words out there and use them.\n\n57:03.200 --> 57:05.880\n You don't have to be the creator of them.\n\n57:05.880 --> 57:08.200\n Just as the great painter doesn't invent the painting,\n\n57:08.200 --> 57:10.320\n they're taking things from others.\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:11.640\n As a small aside,\n\n57:11.640 --> 57:15.080\n is there something you could say about FDR\n\n57:15.080 --> 57:16.480\n and Hitler?\n\n57:19.240 --> 57:21.480\n I constantly tried to think,\n\n57:21.480 --> 57:23.880\n can this person, can this moment in history\n\n57:23.880 --> 57:28.880\n have been circumvented, prevented?\n\n57:29.320 --> 57:31.600\n Can Hitler have been stopped?\n\n57:31.600 --> 57:34.800\n Can some of the atrocities from my own family\n\n57:34.800 --> 57:37.560\n that my grandparents had to live through\n\n57:37.560 --> 57:39.840\n the starvation in the Soviet Union,\n\n57:39.840 --> 57:42.400\n so the thing that people don't often talk about\n\n57:42.400 --> 57:45.320\n is the atrocities committed by Stalin and his own people.\n\n57:46.840 --> 57:51.840\n It feels like here's this great leader, FDR,\n\n57:53.560 --> 57:58.560\n that had the chance to have an impact on the world\n\n57:59.320 --> 58:04.320\n that he already probably had a great positive impact,\n\n58:05.320 --> 58:09.920\n but had a chance to stop maybe World War II\n\n58:09.920 --> 58:12.040\n or stop some of the evils.\n\n58:12.040 --> 58:14.400\n When you look at how weak Hitler was\n\n58:14.400 --> 58:17.760\n from much of the 30s relative to militarily,\n\n58:17.760 --> 58:19.560\n relative to everything else,\n\n58:19.560 --> 58:22.320\n how many people could have done a lot to stop him?\n\n58:23.320 --> 58:26.600\n And FDR in particular didn't.\n\n58:26.600 --> 58:31.040\n He tried to play, not pacify,\n\n58:31.040 --> 58:36.040\n but basically do diplomacy and let Germany do Germany,\n\n58:36.760 --> 58:40.080\n let Europe do Europe, and focus on America.\n\n58:40.080 --> 58:42.240\n Is there something you would,\n\n58:42.240 --> 58:44.640\n would you hold his feet to the fire on this?\n\n58:44.640 --> 58:47.560\n Or is it very difficult from the perspective of FDR\n\n58:47.560 --> 58:49.640\n to have known what was coming?\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:52.600\n I think FDR had a sense of what was coming,\n\n58:52.600 --> 58:55.080\n not quite the enormity of what Hitler was doing\n\n58:55.080 --> 58:57.360\n and not quite the enormity of what the Holocaust became.\n\n58:57.360 --> 58:59.440\n I also lost relatives in the Holocaust.\n\n59:01.640 --> 59:04.440\n And part of that was beyond the imagination of human beings.\n\n59:04.440 --> 59:08.640\n But it's clear in his papers that as early as 1934,\n\n59:08.640 --> 59:10.360\n people he respected, who he knew well,\n\n59:10.360 --> 59:12.320\n told him that Hitler was very dangerous.\n\n59:12.320 --> 59:15.200\n They also thought Hitler was crazy, that he was a lunatic.\n\n59:15.200 --> 59:18.840\n Hamilton Fish Armstrong, who was a friend of Roosevelt's,\n\n59:18.840 --> 59:20.400\n who was actually the Council on Foreign Relations\n\n59:20.400 --> 59:22.520\n in New York, had a meeting with Hitler in 1934.\n\n59:22.520 --> 59:24.920\n I remember reading the account of this.\n\n59:24.920 --> 59:25.960\n And he basically said to FDR,\n\n59:25.960 --> 59:27.520\n this man is gonna cause a war.\n\n59:27.520 --> 59:28.680\n He's gonna cause a lot of damage.\n\n59:28.680 --> 59:30.600\n Again, they didn't know quite the scale.\n\n59:30.600 --> 59:32.320\n So they saw this coming.\n\n59:32.320 --> 59:33.520\n They saw this coming.\n\n59:33.520 --> 59:34.960\n FDR had two problems.\n\n59:34.960 --> 59:38.720\n First, he had an American public that was deeply isolationist.\n\n59:38.720 --> 59:40.280\n The opposite of the problem in a sense\n\n59:40.280 --> 59:41.480\n that we were talking about before.\n\n59:41.480 --> 59:43.600\n If we're an over militarized society,\n\n59:43.600 --> 59:47.840\n now we were a deeply isolationist society in the 1930s.\n\n59:47.840 --> 59:49.520\n The depression reinforced that.\n\n59:49.520 --> 59:52.160\n FDR actually had to break the law in the late 30s\n\n59:52.160 --> 59:53.800\n to support the allies.\n\n59:53.800 --> 59:57.360\n So it was very hard to move the country in that direction,\n\n59:57.360 --> 59:59.920\n especially when he had this program at home,\n\n59:59.920 --> 1:00:01.480\n the New Deal, that he didn't wanna jeopardize\n\n1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.840\n by alienating an isolationist public.\n\n1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:04.680\n That was the reality.\n\n1:00:04.680 --> 1:00:06.000\n We talked about political manipulation.\n\n1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:07.640\n He had to be conscious of that.\n\n1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:09.080\n He had to know his audience.\n\n1:00:09.080 --> 1:00:12.160\n And second, there were no allies willing\n\n1:00:12.160 --> 1:00:14.600\n to invest in this either.\n\n1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:18.080\n The British were as committed to appeasement, as you know.\n\n1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:19.760\n You're obviously very knowledgeable about this.\n\n1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:21.240\n The French were as well.\n\n1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:22.080\n It was very hard.\n\n1:00:22.080 --> 1:00:23.760\n The Russian government, the Soviet government\n\n1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.920\n was cooperating to remilitarize Germany.\n\n1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:30.000\n So there weren't a lot of allies out there either.\n\n1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.520\n I think if there's a criticism to be made of FDR,\n\n1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:35.720\n it's that once we're in the war,\n\n1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:39.160\n he didn't do enough to stop,\n\n1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:41.280\n in particular, the killing of Jews.\n\n1:00:41.280 --> 1:00:42.920\n And there are a number of historians,\n\n1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.520\n myself included, who have written about this,\n\n1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:45.600\n and it's an endless debate.\n\n1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:47.000\n What should he have done?\n\n1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.080\n There's no doubt by 1944,\n\n1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.280\n the United States had air superiority\n\n1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:53.480\n and could have bombed the rail lines to Auschwitz\n\n1:00:53.480 --> 1:00:54.320\n and other camps,\n\n1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.160\n and that would have saved as many as a million Jews.\n\n1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:58.680\n That's a lot of people who could have been saved.\n\n1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:01.680\n Why didn't FDR insist on that?\n\n1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.200\n In part, because he wanted to use every resource possible\n\n1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:05.520\n to win the war.\n\n1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:08.400\n He did not want to be accused of fighting the war for Jews.\n\n1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:09.640\n But I think it's also fair to say\n\n1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:13.400\n that he probably cared less about Jews and East Europeans\n\n1:01:13.400 --> 1:01:15.320\n than he did about others,\n\n1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:18.240\n those of his own Dutch ancestry and from Western Europe.\n\n1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:20.520\n And so, even their race comes in,\n\n1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:22.840\n is also the explanation for the internment of Japanese\n\n1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:23.680\n in the United States,\n\n1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:24.680\n which is a horrible war crime\n\n1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.920\n committed by this heroic president.\n\n1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:29.680\n 120,000 Japanese American citizens\n\n1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:31.440\n lost their freedom unnecessarily.\n\n1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:33.400\n So, he had his limitations.\n\n1:01:33.400 --> 1:01:36.400\n And I think he could have done more during the war\n\n1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:38.920\n to save many more lives.\n\n1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:39.880\n And I wish he had.\n\n1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:42.600\n And there's something to be said about empathy\n\n1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.800\n that you spoke that FDR had empathy.\n\n1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.160\n But us, for example,\n\n1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:49.800\n now there's many people who describe the atrocities\n\n1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:51.760\n happening in China.\n\n1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:53.960\n And there's a bunch of places across the world\n\n1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.600\n where there's atrocities happening now.\n\n1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:57.520\n And we care.\n\n1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:02.520\n We do not uniformly apply how much we care\n\n1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:04.780\n for the suffering of others.\n\n1:02:04.780 --> 1:02:05.620\n That's correct.\n\n1:02:05.620 --> 1:02:06.660\n Depending on the group.\n\n1:02:06.660 --> 1:02:07.620\n That's correct.\n\n1:02:07.620 --> 1:02:10.580\n And in some sense, the role of the president\n\n1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:15.580\n is to rise above that natural human inclination\n\n1:02:15.860 --> 1:02:18.220\n to protect, to do the us versus them,\n\n1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:20.660\n to protect the inner circle\n\n1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:22.780\n and empathize with the suffering of those\n\n1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:24.660\n that are not like you.\n\n1:02:24.660 --> 1:02:25.660\n That's correct.\n\n1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:26.660\n I agree with that.\n\n1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:27.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:33.660\n Speaking of war, you wrote a book on Henry Kissinger.\n\n1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:36.340\n It's not a great transition,\n\n1:02:36.340 --> 1:02:38.080\n but it made sense in my head.\n\n1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:41.660\n Who was Henry Kissinger as a man\n\n1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:43.500\n and as a historical figure?\n\n1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:45.940\n So Henry Kissinger to me is one of the most fascinating\n\n1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:47.380\n figures in history,\n\n1:02:47.380 --> 1:02:49.220\n because he comes to the United States\n\n1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:51.620\n as a German Jewish immigrant at age 15,\n\n1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:53.100\n speaking no English.\n\n1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:56.520\n And within a few years, he's a major figure\n\n1:02:56.520 --> 1:03:00.340\n influencing US foreign policy at the height of US power.\n\n1:03:00.340 --> 1:03:01.500\n But while he's doing that,\n\n1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:03.860\n he's never elected to office\n\n1:03:03.860 --> 1:03:06.820\n and he's constantly reviled by people,\n\n1:03:06.820 --> 1:03:10.420\n including people who are anti Semitic because he's Jewish,\n\n1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:13.540\n but at the same time also his exoticism\n\n1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:15.720\n makes him more attractive to people.\n\n1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.800\n So someone like Nelson Rockefeller wants Kissinger around.\n\n1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:20.220\n He's one of Kissinger's first patrons\n\n1:03:20.220 --> 1:03:22.100\n because he wants a really smart Jew.\n\n1:03:22.100 --> 1:03:23.580\n And Kissinger is gonna be that smart Jew\n\n1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:25.260\n I call Kissinger a policy Jew.\n\n1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:27.420\n There were these court Jews in the 16th and 17th\n\n1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:28.460\n and 18th centuries in Europe.\n\n1:03:28.460 --> 1:03:31.200\n Every king wanted the Jew to manage his banking.\n\n1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:33.020\n And in a sense in the United States\n\n1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:35.100\n in the second half of the 20th century,\n\n1:03:35.100 --> 1:03:36.780\n many presidents want a Jew\n\n1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:38.540\n to manage their international affairs.\n\n1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:39.460\n And what does that really mean?\n\n1:03:39.460 --> 1:03:41.460\n It's not just about being Jewish,\n\n1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:44.260\n it's the internationalism, it's the cosmopolitanism.\n\n1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:45.380\n And that's one of the things\n\n1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:47.020\n I was fascinated with with Kissinger.\n\n1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:48.800\n Someone like Kissinger is unthinkable\n\n1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:50.780\n as a powerful figure in the United States\n\n1:03:50.780 --> 1:03:52.420\n 30 or 40 years earlier,\n\n1:03:52.420 --> 1:03:54.100\n because the United States is run by WASD.\n\n1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.380\n It's run by white elites\n\n1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:58.780\n who come from a certain background.\n\n1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:01.340\n Kissinger represents a moment when American society\n\n1:04:01.340 --> 1:04:03.300\n opens up not to everyone,\n\n1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:05.900\n but opens up to these cosmopolitan figures\n\n1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.620\n who have language skills, historical knowledge,\n\n1:04:08.620 --> 1:04:11.620\n networks that can be used for the US government\n\n1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:14.600\n when after World War II, we have to rebuild Europe,\n\n1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:16.360\n when we have to negotiate with the Soviet Union,\n\n1:04:16.360 --> 1:04:19.360\n when we need the kinds of knowledge we didn't have before.\n\n1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:22.020\n And Harvard where he gets his education late,\n\n1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:23.460\n he started at City College actually,\n\n1:04:23.460 --> 1:04:25.580\n but Harvard where he gets his education late\n\n1:04:25.580 --> 1:04:26.980\n is at the center of what's happening\n\n1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:28.300\n at all these major universities,\n\n1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:29.640\n at Harvard, at Yale, at Stanford,\n\n1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:31.780\n at the University of Texas, everywhere,\n\n1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:34.940\n where they're growing in their international affairs,\n\n1:04:34.940 --> 1:04:36.400\n bringing in the kinds of people\n\n1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:38.580\n who never would be at the university before,\n\n1:04:38.580 --> 1:04:42.660\n training them and then enlisting them in Cold War activities.\n\n1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:46.100\n And so Kissinger is a representative of that phenomenon.\n\n1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:47.580\n I became interested in him\n\n1:04:47.580 --> 1:04:48.940\n because I think he's a bellwether.\n\n1:04:48.940 --> 1:04:52.820\n He shows how power has changed in the United States.\n\n1:04:52.820 --> 1:04:57.340\n So he enters this whole world of politics,\n\n1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.300\n what, post World War II in the 50s?\n\n1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:03.540\n Yes, so he actually, in the 40s even,\n\n1:05:03.540 --> 1:05:05.060\n it's an extraordinary story.\n\n1:05:05.060 --> 1:05:07.540\n He comes to the United States in 1938,\n\n1:05:07.540 --> 1:05:09.940\n just before Kristallnacht, his family leaves.\n\n1:05:09.940 --> 1:05:11.920\n He actually grew up right outside of Nuremberg.\n\n1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:16.220\n They leave right before Kristallnacht in fall of 38,\n\n1:05:16.220 --> 1:05:17.500\n come to New York.\n\n1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:21.020\n He originally works in a brush factory, cleaning brushes,\n\n1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:23.240\n goes to a public high school.\n\n1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:27.300\n And in 1942, just after Pearl Harbor, he joins the military.\n\n1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.380\n And he's very quickly in the military,\n\n1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:33.420\n first of all, given citizenship, which he didn't have before.\n\n1:05:34.340 --> 1:05:36.700\n He's sent for the first time outside of a kosher home.\n\n1:05:36.700 --> 1:05:38.220\n He had been in a kosher home his entire life.\n\n1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:41.380\n He's sent to South Carolina to eat ham for Uncle Sam.\n\n1:05:42.260 --> 1:05:45.020\n And then he is, and this is extraordinary,\n\n1:05:45.020 --> 1:05:48.900\n at the age of 20, barely speaking English,\n\n1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:52.500\n he is sent back to Germany with the US Army\n\n1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:55.580\n in an elite counterintelligence role, why?\n\n1:05:55.580 --> 1:05:57.700\n Because they need German speakers.\n\n1:05:57.700 --> 1:05:58.740\n He came when he was 15,\n\n1:05:58.740 --> 1:06:00.260\n so he actually understands the society.\n\n1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:02.500\n They need people who have that cultural knowledge.\n\n1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.460\n And because he's Jewish,\n\n1:06:04.460 --> 1:06:06.660\n they can trust that he'll be anti Nazi.\n\n1:06:07.700 --> 1:06:10.140\n And there's a whole group of these figures.\n\n1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:11.340\n He's one of many.\n\n1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:13.540\n And so he's in an elite circle.\n\n1:06:13.540 --> 1:06:15.940\n He's discriminated against in New York.\n\n1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:17.300\n When he goes to Harvard after that,\n\n1:06:17.300 --> 1:06:19.380\n he can only live in a Jewish only dorm.\n\n1:06:19.380 --> 1:06:20.220\n But at the same time,\n\n1:06:20.220 --> 1:06:22.980\n he's in an elite policy role in counterintelligence.\n\n1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:25.500\n He forms a network there that stays with him\n\n1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:27.780\n the rest of his career.\n\n1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:29.260\n There's a gentleman named Fritz Kramer,\n\n1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:31.380\n who becomes a sponsor of his\n\n1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:34.780\n in the emerging Pentagon Defense Department world.\n\n1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:36.940\n And as early as the early 1950s,\n\n1:06:36.940 --> 1:06:40.260\n he sent them to Korea to comment on affairs in Korea.\n\n1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.980\n He becomes both an intellectual recognized\n\n1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:44.260\n for his connections,\n\n1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:46.500\n but also someone who policymakers wanna talk about.\n\n1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:48.740\n His book on nuclear weapons, when it's written,\n\n1:06:48.740 --> 1:06:51.660\n is given to President Eisenhower to read\n\n1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:54.220\n because they say this is someone writing interesting things.\n\n1:06:54.220 --> 1:06:56.460\n You should read what he says.\n\n1:06:56.460 --> 1:06:57.860\n There's a certain aspect to him\n\n1:06:57.860 --> 1:06:59.740\n that's kind of like Forrest Gump.\n\n1:06:59.740 --> 1:07:02.060\n He seems to continuously be the right person\n\n1:07:02.060 --> 1:07:03.820\n at the right time in the right place.\n\n1:07:03.820 --> 1:07:04.660\n That's right.\n\n1:07:04.660 --> 1:07:05.660\n Somehow finding him in this.\n\n1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:07.660\n I don't wanna, you know,\n\n1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:11.500\n you can only get lucky so many times\n\n1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:13.540\n because he continues to get lucky\n\n1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:17.060\n in terms of being at the right place in history\n\n1:07:17.060 --> 1:07:19.500\n for many decades, until today.\n\n1:07:19.500 --> 1:07:21.140\n Yeah, well, he has a knack for that.\n\n1:07:21.140 --> 1:07:23.500\n I spent a lot of time talking with him.\n\n1:07:24.580 --> 1:07:27.940\n And what comes through very quickly\n\n1:07:27.940 --> 1:07:29.700\n is that he has an eye for power.\n\n1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:31.820\n It's, I think, unhealthy.\n\n1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:33.220\n He's obsessed with power.\n\n1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:36.380\n Can you explain like an observer of power\n\n1:07:36.380 --> 1:07:39.500\n or does he want power himself?\n\n1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.140\n Yes, both of those things.\n\n1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:41.980\n Both of those.\n\n1:07:41.980 --> 1:07:43.940\n And I think I explained this in the book.\n\n1:07:43.940 --> 1:07:46.180\n He doesn't agree with what I'm gonna say now,\n\n1:07:46.180 --> 1:07:47.980\n but I think I'm right and I think he's right.\n\n1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:50.740\n It's very hard to analyze yourself, right?\n\n1:07:50.740 --> 1:07:54.380\n I think he develops an obsession with gaining power\n\n1:07:54.380 --> 1:07:57.660\n because he sees what happens when you have no power.\n\n1:07:57.660 --> 1:08:00.180\n He experiences the trauma.\n\n1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:04.980\n His father is a very respected Gymnasium Lehrer in Germany.\n\n1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:06.420\n Even though he's Jewish,\n\n1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:09.460\n he's actually the teacher of German classics\n\n1:08:09.460 --> 1:08:11.180\n to the German kids.\n\n1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:12.020\n That's great.\n\n1:08:12.020 --> 1:08:15.580\n And he's forced to flee and he becomes nothing.\n\n1:08:15.580 --> 1:08:17.900\n His father never really makes a way\n\n1:08:17.900 --> 1:08:18.980\n for himself in the United States.\n\n1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.100\n He becomes a postal delivery person,\n\n1:08:21.100 --> 1:08:22.100\n which is nothing wrong with that,\n\n1:08:22.100 --> 1:08:25.260\n but for someone who's a respected teacher in Germany,\n\n1:08:25.260 --> 1:08:27.820\n and Gymnasium Lehrer are like professors there, right?\n\n1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:29.380\n To then be in this position.\n\n1:08:29.380 --> 1:08:31.300\n His mother has to open a catering business\n\n1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:33.100\n when they come to New York.\n\n1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:35.740\n It's a typical immigrant story, but he sees the trauma.\n\n1:08:35.740 --> 1:08:38.260\n His grandparents are killed by the Nazis.\n\n1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:41.940\n So he sees the trauma and he realizes how perilous it is\n\n1:08:41.940 --> 1:08:43.060\n to be without power.\n\n1:08:43.060 --> 1:08:46.500\n And you're saying he does not want to acknowledge\n\n1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:48.180\n the effect of that?\n\n1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:49.900\n It's hard.\n\n1:08:49.900 --> 1:08:50.740\n It's hard.\n\n1:08:50.740 --> 1:08:52.660\n I mean, most of us, if we've had trauma,\n\n1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:54.260\n it's believable that it's traumatic\n\n1:08:54.260 --> 1:08:55.180\n because you don't talk about it.\n\n1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:58.980\n I have a friend who interviews combat veterans and he says,\n\n1:08:58.980 --> 1:09:01.100\n as soon as someone freely wants to tell me\n\n1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:02.660\n about their combat trauma,\n\n1:09:02.660 --> 1:09:05.260\n I suspect that they're not telling me the truth.\n\n1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:08.900\n If it's traumatic, it's hard to talk about.\n\n1:09:08.900 --> 1:09:13.140\n Yeah, sometimes I wonder how much from my own life,\n\n1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:15.740\n everything that I've ever done is just the result\n\n1:09:15.740 --> 1:09:18.180\n of the complicated relationship with my father.\n\n1:09:21.100 --> 1:09:23.180\n I tend to, I had a really difficult time.\n\n1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:25.620\n I did a podcast conversation with him.\n\n1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:26.460\n I saw it actually.\n\n1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:27.420\n Yeah, it's great.\n\n1:09:27.420 --> 1:09:28.780\n It's great.\n\n1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:31.860\n It was, I was thinking I could never do that with my father.\n\n1:09:31.860 --> 1:09:33.940\n But I remember as I was doing it,\n\n1:09:33.940 --> 1:09:37.060\n and for months after I regretted doing it,\n\n1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:39.140\n I just kept regretting it.\n\n1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:42.300\n And the fact that I was regretting it spoke to the fact\n\n1:09:42.300 --> 1:09:45.020\n that I'm running away from some truths\n\n1:09:45.020 --> 1:09:47.700\n that are back there somewhere.\n\n1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:50.540\n And that's perhaps what Kissinger is as well.\n\n1:09:50.540 --> 1:09:53.180\n But is there, I mean, he's done,\n\n1:09:53.180 --> 1:09:56.700\n he's been a part of so many interesting moments\n\n1:09:56.700 --> 1:09:59.100\n of American history, of world history,\n\n1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:03.420\n from the Cold War, Vietnam War, until today.\n\n1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:07.220\n What stands out to you as a particularly important moment\n\n1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:12.300\n in his career that made who he is?\n\n1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:18.340\n Well, I think what made his career in many ways\n\n1:10:18.340 --> 1:10:23.340\n was his experience in the 1950s, building a network,\n\n1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:26.460\n a network of people across the world\n\n1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:30.340\n who were rising leaders from unique positions.\n\n1:10:30.340 --> 1:10:35.220\n He ran what he called the International Seminar at Harvard,\n\n1:10:35.220 --> 1:10:37.300\n which was actually a summer school class\n\n1:10:37.300 --> 1:10:39.340\n that no one at Harvard cared about.\n\n1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:44.340\n But he invited all of these rising intellectuals\n\n1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:46.780\n and thinkers from around the world.\n\n1:10:46.780 --> 1:10:50.860\n And he built a network there that he used forevermore.\n\n1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:53.980\n So that's what really, I think, boosts him.\n\n1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:56.820\n The most important moments in terms of making his reputation\n\n1:10:56.820 --> 1:10:59.340\n and making his career are two sets of activities.\n\n1:10:59.340 --> 1:11:00.860\n One is the opening to China.\n\n1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:04.580\n And his ability to, first of all,\n\n1:11:04.580 --> 1:11:07.580\n take control of US policy without the authority to do that\n\n1:11:07.580 --> 1:11:11.180\n and direct US policy, and then build a relationship\n\n1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:14.580\n with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai that was unthinkable\n\n1:11:14.580 --> 1:11:16.580\n just four or five years earlier.\n\n1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:18.860\n Of course, President Nixon is a big part of that as well,\n\n1:11:18.860 --> 1:11:20.780\n but Kissinger is the mover and shaker on that.\n\n1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:23.660\n And it's a lot of manipulation, but it's also a vision.\n\n1:11:23.660 --> 1:11:26.860\n Now, this is in the moment of American history\n\n1:11:26.860 --> 1:11:29.660\n where there's a very powerful anti communism.\n\n1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:30.500\n Correct.\n\n1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:33.820\n So communism is seen as much more even though\n\n1:11:33.820 --> 1:11:35.620\n than today as the enemy.\n\n1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:36.460\n Correct.\n\n1:11:36.460 --> 1:11:37.460\n And China in particular,\n\n1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:40.700\n they were one of our key enemies in Vietnam.\n\n1:11:40.700 --> 1:11:42.300\n And in Korea, American forces\n\n1:11:42.300 --> 1:11:44.100\n were fighting Chinese forces directly.\n\n1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:45.900\n Chinese forces come over the border.\n\n1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:49.180\n Thousands of Americans die at the hand of Chinese forces.\n\n1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:50.540\n So for the long time, the United States\n\n1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:52.260\n had no relationship with communist China.\n\n1:11:52.260 --> 1:11:54.460\n He opens that relationship.\n\n1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:58.260\n And at the same time, he also creates a whole new dynamic\n\n1:11:58.260 --> 1:11:59.420\n in the Middle East.\n\n1:11:59.420 --> 1:12:02.340\n After the 1973 war, the so called Yom Kippur War,\n\n1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:05.100\n he steps in and becomes the leading negotiator\n\n1:12:05.100 --> 1:12:07.500\n between the Israelis, the Egyptians,\n\n1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:09.980\n and other major actors in the region.\n\n1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:12.780\n And it makes the United States the most powerful actor\n\n1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:15.420\n in the Middle East, the Soviet Union far less powerful,\n\n1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.940\n which is great for the United States in the 70s and 80s.\n\n1:12:17.940 --> 1:12:19.420\n It gets us though into the problems\n\n1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:21.780\n we of course have thereafter.\n\n1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:25.460\n So that speaks to the very pragmatic approach\n\n1:12:25.460 --> 1:12:28.740\n that he's taken the realistic approach\n\n1:12:28.740 --> 1:12:33.740\n versus the idealistic approach termed realpolitik.\n\n1:12:34.580 --> 1:12:35.780\n What is this thing?\n\n1:12:35.780 --> 1:12:38.900\n What is this approach to world politics?\n\n1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:43.500\n So realpolitik for Kissinger is really focusing\n\n1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:46.980\n on the power centers in the world\n\n1:12:46.980 --> 1:12:49.300\n and trying as best you can to manipulate\n\n1:12:49.300 --> 1:12:51.140\n those power centers to serve the interests\n\n1:12:51.140 --> 1:12:52.580\n of your own country.\n\n1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:54.420\n And so that's why he's a multilateralist.\n\n1:12:54.420 --> 1:12:55.940\n He's not a unilateralist.\n\n1:12:55.940 --> 1:12:58.420\n He believes the United States should put itself\n\n1:12:58.420 --> 1:13:00.060\n at the center of negotiations\n\n1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.060\n between other powerful countries.\n\n1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:03.900\n But that's also why he pays very little attention\n\n1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:05.500\n to countries that are less powerful.\n\n1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:07.220\n And this is why he's often criticized\n\n1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:09.020\n by human rights activists.\n\n1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:12.500\n For him, parts of Africa and Latin America,\n\n1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:14.420\n which you and I would consider important places\n\n1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:16.740\n are unimportant because they don't have power.\n\n1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:17.900\n They can't project their power.\n\n1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:20.540\n They don't produce a lot of economic wealth.\n\n1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:21.620\n And so they matter less.\n\n1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:25.260\n Realpolitik views the world in a hierarchy of power.\n\n1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:31.940\n How does realpolitik realize itself in the world?\n\n1:13:32.140 --> 1:13:34.980\n What does that really mean?\n\n1:13:34.980 --> 1:13:37.100\n Like how do you push forward the interest\n\n1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:37.980\n of your own country?\n\n1:13:37.980 --> 1:13:40.060\n You said there's power centers,\n\n1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:45.060\n but it is a big bold move to negotiate\n\n1:13:45.420 --> 1:13:47.460\n to work with a communist nation,\n\n1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:50.500\n with your enemies that are powerful.\n\n1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:53.780\n What is the sort of, if you can further elaborate\n\n1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:55.020\n the philosophy behind it.\n\n1:13:55.020 --> 1:13:57.180\n Sure, so there are two key elements\n\n1:13:57.180 --> 1:13:59.820\n that then end up producing all kinds of tactics.\n\n1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:01.980\n But the two strategic elements of Kissinger's way\n\n1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:03.340\n of thinking about realpolitik,\n\n1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:04.580\n which are classical ways,\n\n1:14:04.580 --> 1:14:07.100\n going back to Thucydides and the Greeks,\n\n1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:08.700\n are to say, first of all,\n\n1:14:08.700 --> 1:14:10.820\n you figure out who your allies are\n\n1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:13.380\n and you build webs of connection\n\n1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:16.300\n so that your allies help you to acquire\n\n1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:18.340\n what you want to acquire.\n\n1:14:18.340 --> 1:14:20.100\n This is why, according to Herodotus,\n\n1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:21.260\n the Greeks beat the Persians.\n\n1:14:21.260 --> 1:14:22.460\n The Persians are bigger,\n\n1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:24.100\n but the Greeks, the Spartans, the Athenians,\n\n1:14:24.100 --> 1:14:25.180\n others are able to work together\n\n1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:27.260\n and leverage their resources.\n\n1:14:27.260 --> 1:14:28.740\n So it's about leveraging your resources.\n\n1:14:28.740 --> 1:14:31.100\n For Kissinger, this makes Western Europe\n\n1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:32.420\n crucially important.\n\n1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:35.060\n It makes Japan crucially important.\n\n1:14:35.060 --> 1:14:38.300\n It makes Israel and Egypt crucially important\n\n1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:39.460\n in building these webs.\n\n1:14:39.460 --> 1:14:41.060\n You build your surrogates,\n\n1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:43.100\n you build your brother states.\n\n1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:44.220\n In other parts of the world,\n\n1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:46.260\n you build tight connections and you work together\n\n1:14:46.260 --> 1:14:49.060\n to control the resources that you want.\n\n1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:50.900\n The second element of the strategy\n\n1:14:50.900 --> 1:14:53.740\n is not to go to war with your adversary,\n\n1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.060\n but to do all you can to limit the power\n\n1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:57.420\n of your adversary.\n\n1:14:57.420 --> 1:14:59.340\n Some of that is containment,\n\n1:14:59.340 --> 1:15:01.500\n preventing the Soviet Union from expanding.\n\n1:15:01.500 --> 1:15:04.260\n That was the key element of American Cold War policy.\n\n1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:07.180\n But sometimes it's actually negotiation.\n\n1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.020\n That's what detente was about for Kissinger.\n\n1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:09.900\n He spends a lot of time,\n\n1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.500\n more time than any other American foreign policymaker,\n\n1:15:12.500 --> 1:15:14.500\n negotiating with Soviet leaders\n\n1:15:14.500 --> 1:15:15.900\n as well as Chinese leaders.\n\n1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:16.740\n What does he want to do?\n\n1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:18.540\n He wants to limit the nuclear arms race.\n\n1:15:18.540 --> 1:15:19.900\n The United States is ahead.\n\n1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:22.780\n We don't want the Soviet Union to get ahead of us.\n\n1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:26.100\n We negotiate to limit their abilities, right?\n\n1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:28.140\n We play to our strengths.\n\n1:15:28.140 --> 1:15:31.620\n So it's a combination of keeping your adversary down\n\n1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:33.660\n and building tight webs.\n\n1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:36.580\n Within that context, military force is used,\n\n1:15:36.580 --> 1:15:39.100\n but you're not using war for the sake of war.\n\n1:15:39.100 --> 1:15:43.300\n You're using warfare to further your access to the resources,\n\n1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:46.420\n economic, political, geographic that you want.\n\n1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:49.100\n To build relationships and then the second thing,\n\n1:15:49.100 --> 1:15:51.020\n to limit the powers of those you're against.\n\n1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:51.860\n Exactly.\n\n1:15:51.860 --> 1:15:56.060\n So is there any sort of insights\n\n1:15:56.060 --> 1:15:59.140\n into how he preferred to build relationships?\n\n1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:03.060\n Are we talking about like, again, it's the one on one.\n\n1:16:03.060 --> 1:16:05.140\n Is it through policy or is it through like,\n\n1:16:05.140 --> 1:16:06.860\n phone conversations?\n\n1:16:06.860 --> 1:16:09.820\n Is there any cool kind of insights that you could speak to?\n\n1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:14.420\n Yeah, Kissinger is the ultimate kiss up.\n\n1:16:14.420 --> 1:16:16.700\n He is, some used to make fun of him.\n\n1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.900\n In fact, even the filmmaker from Dr. Strangelove,\n\n1:16:20.900 --> 1:16:23.700\n whose name I'm forgetting, Stanley Kubrick,\n\n1:16:23.700 --> 1:16:26.100\n called him kiss up at that time, right?\n\n1:16:27.260 --> 1:16:30.220\n He had a wonderful way of figuring out\n\n1:16:30.220 --> 1:16:33.580\n what it is you wanted, back to that discussion we had before\n\n1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:35.620\n and trying to show how he could give you more\n\n1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:36.780\n of what you wanted as a leader.\n\n1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:40.460\n It was very personalistic, very personalistic.\n\n1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:43.060\n And he spends a lot of time, for example,\n\n1:16:43.060 --> 1:16:46.620\n kissing up to Leonid Brezhnev, kissing up to Mao.\n\n1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:48.140\n He tells Mao, you're the greatest leader\n\n1:16:48.140 --> 1:16:49.700\n in the history of the 20th century.\n\n1:16:49.700 --> 1:16:52.540\n People will look back on you as the great leader.\n\n1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:55.460\n Some of this sounds like BS, but it's serious, right?\n\n1:16:55.460 --> 1:16:58.340\n He's feeding the egos of those around him.\n\n1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:02.060\n Second, he is willing to get things done for you.\n\n1:17:02.060 --> 1:17:03.020\n He's effective.\n\n1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:05.500\n You want him around you because of his efficacy.\n\n1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.740\n So Richard Nixon is always suspicious\n\n1:17:07.740 --> 1:17:09.660\n that Henry Kissinger is getting more of the limelight.\n\n1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:11.780\n He hates that Kissinger gets the Nobel Peace Prize\n\n1:17:11.780 --> 1:17:13.940\n and he doesn't, but he needs him.\n\n1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:16.420\n Because Kissinger's the guy who gets things done.\n\n1:17:16.420 --> 1:17:17.620\n So he performs.\n\n1:17:17.620 --> 1:17:19.540\n He builds a relationship in almost,\n\n1:17:19.540 --> 1:17:21.340\n I say this in the book, in almost a gangster way.\n\n1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:23.100\n He didn't like that he criticized that part of the book.\n\n1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:25.460\n But again, I still think the evidence is there.\n\n1:17:26.460 --> 1:17:28.860\n You need something to be done, boss, I'll do it.\n\n1:17:29.780 --> 1:17:32.020\n And don't forget that I'm doing this for you.\n\n1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:35.060\n And you get mutual dependency in a Hegelian way, right?\n\n1:17:35.060 --> 1:17:39.980\n And so he builds this personal dependency\n\n1:17:39.980 --> 1:17:42.460\n through ego and through performance.\n\n1:17:42.460 --> 1:17:46.780\n And then he's so skillful at making decisions\n\n1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:48.340\n for people who are more powerful\n\n1:17:48.340 --> 1:17:49.780\n because he's never elected to office.\n\n1:17:49.780 --> 1:17:53.060\n He always needs powerful people to let him do things.\n\n1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:55.820\n But he convinces you it's your decision when it's really his.\n\n1:17:55.820 --> 1:17:57.660\n To read his memos are beautiful.\n\n1:17:57.660 --> 1:17:59.780\n He's actually very skilled at writing things\n\n1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:02.420\n in a way that looks like he's giving you options\n\n1:18:02.420 --> 1:18:05.420\n as president, but in fact, there's only one option there.\n\n1:18:05.420 --> 1:18:10.420\n Is he, speaking to the gangster, to the loyalty,\n\n1:18:10.740 --> 1:18:14.060\n is he ever, like the sense I got from Nixon\n\n1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:18.100\n is he would, Nixon would backstab you if he needed to.\n\n1:18:19.900 --> 1:18:24.140\n One of the things that I admire about gangsters\n\n1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:28.820\n is they don't backstab those in their circle,\n\n1:18:28.820 --> 1:18:30.700\n like loyalty above all else.\n\n1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:33.260\n I mean, at least that's the sense I've gotten\n\n1:18:33.260 --> 1:18:36.500\n from the stories of the past, at least.\n\n1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:38.820\n Is, where would you put Kissinger on that?\n\n1:18:38.820 --> 1:18:41.820\n Is he loyalty above all else?\n\n1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:45.900\n Or is it, or a human, it's like the Steve Jobs thing,\n\n1:18:45.900 --> 1:18:48.220\n is like, as long as you're useful, you're useful,\n\n1:18:48.220 --> 1:18:52.420\n but then once, the moment you're no longer useful\n\n1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:55.340\n is when you're knocked off the chessboard.\n\n1:18:55.340 --> 1:18:56.380\n It's the latter with him.\n\n1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:59.260\n He's backstabbing quite a lot.\n\n1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:00.740\n And he's self serving.\n\n1:19:00.740 --> 1:19:03.820\n But he also makes himself so useful\n\n1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.740\n that even though Nixon knows he's doing that,\n\n1:19:05.740 --> 1:19:07.300\n Nixon still needs him.\n\n1:19:07.300 --> 1:19:08.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:13.420\n By the way, on that point, so having spoken with Kissinger,\n\n1:19:13.420 --> 1:19:15.380\n what's your relationship like with him\n\n1:19:15.380 --> 1:19:20.380\n as somebody who is in an objective way writing his story?\n\n1:19:21.540 --> 1:19:22.620\n It was very difficult\n\n1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:25.780\n because he's very good at manipulating people.\n\n1:19:25.780 --> 1:19:28.900\n And we had about 12 or 13 interviews,\n\n1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:31.340\n usually informal over lunch.\n\n1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:34.980\n And this was many years ago.\n\n1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:37.580\n This is probably now more than 10 years ago.\n\n1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:41.420\n Did you find yourself being like sweet talked,\n\n1:19:41.420 --> 1:19:43.940\n like to where you like go back home later\n\n1:19:43.940 --> 1:19:44.900\n and look in the mirror and it's like,\n\n1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:46.300\n wait, what just happened?\n\n1:19:46.300 --> 1:19:48.980\n He can be enormously charming\n\n1:19:48.980 --> 1:19:51.020\n and enormously obnoxious at the same time.\n\n1:19:51.020 --> 1:19:53.380\n So I would have these very mixed emotions\n\n1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:54.700\n because he gives no ground.\n\n1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:58.580\n He's unwilling to, and I think this is a weakness,\n\n1:19:58.580 --> 1:20:01.940\n he's unwilling to admit mistake.\n\n1:20:03.580 --> 1:20:05.100\n Others make mistakes, but he doesn't.\n\n1:20:05.100 --> 1:20:07.860\n And he certainly won't take on any of the big criticisms\n\n1:20:07.860 --> 1:20:09.140\n that are pushed.\n\n1:20:09.140 --> 1:20:09.980\n I understand why.\n\n1:20:09.980 --> 1:20:11.740\n I mean, when you've worked as hard for what he has\n\n1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:13.740\n as he has, you're defensive about it.\n\n1:20:13.740 --> 1:20:15.580\n But he is very defensive and he's very fragile about it.\n\n1:20:15.580 --> 1:20:17.620\n He does not like criticisms at all.\n\n1:20:17.620 --> 1:20:19.820\n He used to, he hasn't done this in a while,\n\n1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:22.420\n but he used to call me up and yell at me on the phone,\n\n1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:24.620\n quite literally, when I would be quoted\n\n1:20:24.620 --> 1:20:27.220\n in the New York Times or somewhere saying something\n\n1:20:27.220 --> 1:20:28.740\n that sounded critical of him.\n\n1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:30.420\n So for instance, there was one instance\n\n1:20:30.420 --> 1:20:31.380\n a number of years ago,\n\n1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:34.460\n where a reporter came across some documents\n\n1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:37.740\n where Kissinger said negative things about Jews in Russia.\n\n1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:39.460\n Typical things that a German Jew would say\n\n1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:41.580\n about East European Jews.\n\n1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:44.660\n And the New York Times asked me, is this accurate?\n\n1:20:44.660 --> 1:20:46.860\n And I said, yeah, the documents are accurate.\n\n1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:47.740\n I've seen them, they're accurate.\n\n1:20:47.740 --> 1:20:49.820\n He was so angry about that.\n\n1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:50.740\n So there's the fragility,\n\n1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:52.060\n but there's also the enormous charm\n\n1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:53.740\n and the enormous intelligence.\n\n1:20:53.740 --> 1:20:54.860\n The real challenge with him though,\n\n1:20:54.860 --> 1:20:56.940\n is he's very good at making his case.\n\n1:20:56.940 --> 1:20:57.860\n He'll convince you.\n\n1:20:58.780 --> 1:21:02.220\n And as a scholar, as an observer,\n\n1:21:02.220 --> 1:21:03.660\n you don't wanna hear a lawyer's case.\n\n1:21:03.660 --> 1:21:05.580\n You wanna actually interrogate the evidence\n\n1:21:05.580 --> 1:21:07.060\n and get to the truth.\n\n1:21:07.060 --> 1:21:09.340\n And so that was a real challenge with him.\n\n1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:13.180\n So speaking of his approach of realpolitik,\n\n1:21:14.220 --> 1:21:17.020\n if we just zoom out and look at a human history,\n\n1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:20.660\n human civilization, what do you think works best\n\n1:21:20.660 --> 1:21:25.580\n in the way we progress forward?\n\n1:21:25.580 --> 1:21:28.700\n A realistic approach, do whatever it takes,\n\n1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:30.500\n control the centers of power,\n\n1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:34.100\n to play a game for the greater interests\n\n1:21:34.100 --> 1:21:36.420\n of the good guys, quote unquote.\n\n1:21:36.420 --> 1:21:40.100\n Or lead by sort of idealism,\n\n1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:45.100\n which is like truly act in the best version\n\n1:21:46.860 --> 1:21:48.660\n of the ideas you represent,\n\n1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:52.180\n as opposed to kind of present one view\n\n1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:55.460\n and then do whatever it takes behind the scenes.\n\n1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:56.620\n Obviously you need some of both,\n\n1:21:56.620 --> 1:21:58.340\n but I lean more to the idealistic side\n\n1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:00.540\n and more so actually, believe it or not,\n\n1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:04.380\n as I get into my 40s, as I do more historical work.\n\n1:22:04.380 --> 1:22:05.220\n Why do I say that?\n\n1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:07.500\n Because I think, and this is one of my criticisms\n\n1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:10.020\n of Kissinger, who I also have a lot of respect for,\n\n1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:12.140\n the realpolitik becomes self defeating\n\n1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:15.380\n because you're constantly running to keep power,\n\n1:22:15.380 --> 1:22:17.140\n but you forget why.\n\n1:22:17.140 --> 1:22:18.740\n And you often then use power,\n\n1:22:18.740 --> 1:22:20.340\n and I think Kissinger falls into this\n\n1:22:20.340 --> 1:22:22.620\n in some of his worst moments, not all of his moments,\n\n1:22:22.620 --> 1:22:23.860\n where the power is actually being used\n\n1:22:23.860 --> 1:22:25.580\n to undermine the things you care about.\n\n1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:27.300\n It's sort of the example of being a parent\n\n1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:28.980\n and you're doing all these things\n\n1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:32.260\n to take your kid to violin, basketball, all these things,\n\n1:22:32.260 --> 1:22:33.860\n and you realize you're actually killing your kid\n\n1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:35.580\n and making your kid very unhappy.\n\n1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:36.780\n And the whole reason you were doing it\n\n1:22:36.780 --> 1:22:39.140\n was to improve the person's life.\n\n1:22:39.140 --> 1:22:41.380\n And so you have to remember why it is,\n\n1:22:41.380 --> 1:22:43.940\n what Hans Morgenthau calls this is your purpose.\n\n1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:45.780\n Your purpose has to drive you.\n\n1:22:45.780 --> 1:22:49.180\n Now your purpose doesn't have to be airy, fiery idealism.\n\n1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:52.300\n So I believe deeply in democracy is an ideal.\n\n1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:56.700\n I don't think it's gonna ever look like Athenian democracy,\n\n1:22:56.700 --> 1:23:00.220\n but that should drive our policy.\n\n1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:01.460\n But we still have to be realistic\n\n1:23:01.460 --> 1:23:03.460\n and recognize we're not gonna build that democracy\n\n1:23:03.460 --> 1:23:04.780\n in Afghanistan tomorrow.\n\n1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:07.940\n I mean, does it ultimately just boil down again\n\n1:23:07.940 --> 1:23:09.580\n to the corrupting nature of power\n\n1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:14.580\n that nobody can hold power for very long\n\n1:23:16.260 --> 1:23:21.260\n before you start acting in the interest of power\n\n1:23:21.260 --> 1:23:23.940\n as opposed to in the interest of your ideals?\n\n1:23:23.940 --> 1:23:27.420\n It's impossible to be like somebody like Kissinger\n\n1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:32.420\n who is essentially in power for many, many decades\n\n1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:37.260\n and still remember what are the initial ideals\n\n1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:41.340\n that you strove to achieve.\n\n1:23:42.540 --> 1:23:44.380\n Yes, I think that's exactly right.\n\n1:23:44.380 --> 1:23:48.300\n There's a moment in the book I quote about him,\n\n1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:49.380\n comes from one of our interviews.\n\n1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:54.060\n I asked him, what were the guiding ideals for your policies?\n\n1:23:54.060 --> 1:23:57.300\n And he said, I'm not prepared to share that.\n\n1:23:57.300 --> 1:23:58.900\n And I don't think it's because he doesn't know\n\n1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:00.500\n what he thinks he was trying to do.\n\n1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:04.620\n He realizes his use of power departed quite a lot from.\n\n1:24:04.620 --> 1:24:08.100\n So it would sound, if he made them explicit,\n\n1:24:08.100 --> 1:24:09.460\n it would sound hypocritical.\n\n1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:10.300\n Correct.\n\n1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:15.180\n Well, on that, let me ask about war.\n\n1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:20.140\n America often presents itself to its own people,\n\n1:24:20.140 --> 1:24:22.660\n but just the leaders, when they look in the mirror,\n\n1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:26.560\n I get a sense that we think of ourselves as the good guys.\n\n1:24:29.780 --> 1:24:34.780\n And especially this begins sometimes to look hypocritical\n\n1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:36.260\n when you're waging war.\n\n1:24:38.260 --> 1:24:43.260\n Is there a good way to know when you've lost all sense\n\n1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:46.300\n of what it is to be good?\n\n1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:52.620\n Another way to ask that, is there in military policy\n\n1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.820\n in conducting war, is there a good way to know\n\n1:24:55.820 --> 1:24:59.980\n what is a just war and what is a war crime?\n\n1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:03.820\n I mean, in some circles, Kissinger is accused\n\n1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:07.360\n of contributing, being a war criminal.\n\n1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.080\n Yes, and I argue in the book, he's not a war criminal,\n\n1:25:10.080 --> 1:25:15.080\n but that doesn't mean that he didn't misuse military power.\n\n1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:20.020\n I think a just war, a just war,\n\n1:25:20.020 --> 1:25:21.780\n as Michael Walzer and others write about it,\n\n1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:26.020\n a just war is a war where both the purpose is just,\n\n1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:29.780\n and you are using the means to get to that purpose\n\n1:25:29.780 --> 1:25:33.400\n that kill as few people as necessary.\n\n1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:35.180\n That doesn't mean they won't be killing,\n\n1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:36.020\n but as few as necessary.\n\n1:25:36.020 --> 1:25:37.300\n Proportionality, right?\n\n1:25:37.300 --> 1:25:40.580\n Your means should be proportional to your ends.\n\n1:25:40.580 --> 1:25:43.500\n And that's often lost sight of,\n\n1:25:43.500 --> 1:25:48.500\n because the drive to get to the end often self justifies\n\n1:25:48.620 --> 1:25:50.100\n means that go well beyond that.\n\n1:25:50.100 --> 1:25:55.100\n And so that's how we get into torture in the war on terror.\n\n1:25:55.620 --> 1:25:57.980\n Is there some kind of lesson for the future\n\n1:25:57.980 --> 1:26:00.160\n that you can take away from that?\n\n1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:03.940\n Yes, I think the first set of lessons that I've shared\n\n1:26:03.940 --> 1:26:06.820\n as a historian with military decision makers is,\n\n1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.580\n first of all, always remember why you're there,\n\n1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:10.460\n what your purpose is, and always ask yourself\n\n1:26:10.460 --> 1:26:13.620\n if the means you're using are actually proportional.\n\n1:26:13.620 --> 1:26:15.140\n Ask that question.\n\n1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.300\n Just because you have these means that you can use,\n\n1:26:17.300 --> 1:26:19.340\n just because you have these tools,\n\n1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:22.180\n doesn't mean they're the right tools to use.\n\n1:26:22.180 --> 1:26:25.180\n And here's the question that follows from that.\n\n1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.780\n And it's a hard question to ask,\n\n1:26:26.780 --> 1:26:29.380\n because the answer is one we often don't like to hear.\n\n1:26:29.380 --> 1:26:33.140\n Are the things I'm doing in war actually doing more harm\n\n1:26:33.140 --> 1:26:36.900\n or more good to the reason I went into war?\n\n1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:39.020\n We came to a point in the war on terror\n\n1:26:39.020 --> 1:26:40.100\n where what we were doing was actually\n\n1:26:40.100 --> 1:26:41.300\n creating more terrorists.\n\n1:26:42.900 --> 1:26:44.500\n And that's when you have to stop.\n\n1:26:46.140 --> 1:26:47.460\n Well, some of that is in the data,\n\n1:26:47.460 --> 1:26:49.460\n but some of it, there's a leap of faith.\n\n1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:51.140\n So from a parenting perspective,\n\n1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:54.700\n let me speak as a person with no kids and a single guy,\n\n1:26:55.700 --> 1:26:58.100\n let me be the expert in the room on parenting.\n\n1:26:58.100 --> 1:27:03.100\n Now, it does seem that it's a very difficult thing to do,\n\n1:27:05.900 --> 1:27:10.900\n even though you know that your kid was making a mistake,\n\n1:27:10.980 --> 1:27:12.180\n to let them make a mistake,\n\n1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:15.500\n to give them the freedom to make the mistake.\n\n1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:16.580\n I don't know what to do,\n\n1:27:16.580 --> 1:27:19.620\n but I mean, that's a very kind of lighthearted way\n\n1:27:19.620 --> 1:27:21.540\n of phrasing the following,\n\n1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:26.460\n which is when you look at some of the places in the world,\n\n1:27:26.460 --> 1:27:30.660\n like Afghanistan, which is not doing well.\n\n1:27:32.300 --> 1:27:34.900\n To move out knowing that there's going to be\n\n1:27:34.900 --> 1:27:38.980\n a lot of suffering, economic suffering, injustices,\n\n1:27:40.100 --> 1:27:42.540\n terrorist organizations growing,\n\n1:27:42.540 --> 1:27:44.860\n that's committing crimes on its own people\n\n1:27:44.860 --> 1:27:48.660\n and potentially committing crimes against allies,\n\n1:27:48.660 --> 1:27:52.180\n violence against allies, violence against the United States.\n\n1:27:52.180 --> 1:27:57.180\n So how do you know what to do in that case?\n\n1:27:58.260 --> 1:28:01.420\n Well, again, it's an art, not a science,\n\n1:28:01.420 --> 1:28:04.660\n which is what makes it hard for an engineer to think about.\n\n1:28:04.660 --> 1:28:07.180\n This is what makes it endlessly fascinating for me.\n\n1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:08.700\n And I think the real intellectual work\n\n1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:10.740\n is at the level of the art, right?\n\n1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:13.060\n And I think probably engineering at its highest level\n\n1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:14.980\n becomes an art as well, right?\n\n1:28:14.980 --> 1:28:17.660\n So policymaking, you never know.\n\n1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:18.900\n But I will say this,\n\n1:28:18.900 --> 1:28:21.020\n I'll say you have to ask yourself and look in the mirror\n\n1:28:21.020 --> 1:28:23.460\n and say, is all the effort I'm putting in\n\n1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:25.500\n actually making this better?\n\n1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:28.420\n And in Afghanistan, you look at the 20 years\n\n1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:32.740\n and two plus trillion dollars that the US has put in.\n\n1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:34.900\n And the fact that, as you said correctly,\n\n1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:36.020\n it's not doing well right now\n\n1:28:36.020 --> 1:28:37.660\n after 20 years of that investment.\n\n1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:41.780\n I might like a company that I invest in,\n\n1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:44.580\n but after 20 years of my throwing money in that company,\n\n1:28:45.460 --> 1:28:46.300\n it's time to get out.\n\n1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:51.300\n Well, in some sense, getting out now, that's kind of obvious.\n\n1:28:51.540 --> 1:28:54.340\n I'm more interested in how we figure out in the future\n\n1:28:54.340 --> 1:28:57.740\n how to get out earlier than, I mean, at this point,\n\n1:28:57.740 --> 1:28:59.340\n we stayed too long and it's obvious,\n\n1:28:59.340 --> 1:29:02.820\n the data, the investment, nothing is working.\n\n1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:07.580\n The very little data points to us staying there.\n\n1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:11.620\n I'm more interested in being in a relation,\n\n1:29:11.620 --> 1:29:13.740\n let me take it back to a safer place again,\n\n1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:14.740\n being in a relationship\n\n1:29:14.740 --> 1:29:16.300\n and getting out of that relationship\n\n1:29:16.300 --> 1:29:17.420\n while things are still good,\n\n1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:19.300\n but you have a sense that it's not going to end up\n\n1:29:19.300 --> 1:29:20.380\n in a good place.\n\n1:29:20.380 --> 1:29:22.300\n That's the difficult thing.\n\n1:29:22.300 --> 1:29:24.660\n You have to ask yourself, whether it's a relationship\n\n1:29:24.660 --> 1:29:26.300\n or you're talking about policymaking\n\n1:29:26.300 --> 1:29:28.220\n in a place like Afghanistan,\n\n1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:31.540\n are the things I'm doing showing me evidence,\n\n1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:34.220\n real evidence that they're making things better\n\n1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:35.620\n or making things worse?\n\n1:29:35.620 --> 1:29:37.460\n That's a hard question to answer.\n\n1:29:37.460 --> 1:29:38.540\n You have to be very honest.\n\n1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:40.780\n And in a policymaking context,\n\n1:29:40.780 --> 1:29:41.860\n we have to actually do the same thing\n\n1:29:41.860 --> 1:29:43.260\n we do in a relationship context.\n\n1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:44.300\n What do we do in a relationship context?\n\n1:29:44.300 --> 1:29:46.500\n We ask other friends who are observing.\n\n1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:48.060\n We ask for other observers.\n\n1:29:48.060 --> 1:29:50.700\n This is actually just a scientific method element actually\n\n1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:52.540\n that we can't, the Heisenberg principle,\n\n1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:54.540\n I can't see it because I'm too close to it.\n\n1:29:54.540 --> 1:29:57.140\n I'm changing it by my looking at it.\n\n1:29:57.140 --> 1:30:00.500\n I need others to tell me in a policymaking context,\n\n1:30:00.500 --> 1:30:02.660\n this is why you need to hear from other people,\n\n1:30:02.660 --> 1:30:03.900\n not just the generals,\n\n1:30:03.900 --> 1:30:05.860\n because here's the thing about the generals.\n\n1:30:05.860 --> 1:30:09.540\n They generally are patriotic, hardworking people,\n\n1:30:09.540 --> 1:30:11.460\n but they're too close.\n\n1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:12.300\n They're not lying.\n\n1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:13.140\n They're too close.\n\n1:30:13.140 --> 1:30:14.420\n I just think they can do better.\n\n1:30:14.420 --> 1:30:15.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:20.580\n How do you think about the Cold War now\n\n1:30:20.580 --> 1:30:21.940\n from the beginning to end,\n\n1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:26.020\n and maybe also with an eye towards\n\n1:30:26.020 --> 1:30:30.340\n the current potential cyber conflict,\n\n1:30:30.340 --> 1:30:32.860\n cyber war with China and with Russia,\n\n1:30:32.860 --> 1:30:35.580\n if we look sort of other kind of Cold Wars\n\n1:30:35.580 --> 1:30:38.820\n potentially emerging in the 21st century,\n\n1:30:38.820 --> 1:30:43.300\n when you look back at the Cold War of the 20th century,\n\n1:30:43.300 --> 1:30:46.620\n how do you see it and what lessons do we draw from it?\n\n1:30:46.620 --> 1:30:48.340\n It's a wonderful question\n\n1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:50.260\n because I teach this to undergraduates\n\n1:30:50.260 --> 1:30:54.220\n and it's really interesting to see how undergraduates now,\n\n1:30:54.220 --> 1:30:56.620\n almost all of whom were born after 9 11.\n\n1:30:56.620 --> 1:30:57.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:57.580 --> 1:30:59.780\n So the Cold War is ancient history to them.\n\n1:30:59.780 --> 1:31:04.700\n In fact, the Cold War to them is as far removed\n\n1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:07.260\n as the 1950s were to me.\n\n1:31:07.260 --> 1:31:10.700\n I mean, it's unbelievable.\n\n1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:13.420\n It's almost like World War II for my generation\n\n1:31:13.420 --> 1:31:14.940\n and Cold War for them.\n\n1:31:14.940 --> 1:31:15.780\n It's so far removed.\n\n1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:16.820\n The collapse of the Soviet Union\n\n1:31:16.820 --> 1:31:18.340\n doesn't mean anything to them.\n\n1:31:20.220 --> 1:31:23.340\n So how do you describe the Cold War to them?\n\n1:31:23.340 --> 1:31:25.500\n How do you describe the Soviet Union to them?\n\n1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:27.700\n First of all, I have to explain to them\n\n1:31:27.700 --> 1:31:29.700\n why people were so fearful of communism.\n\n1:31:30.700 --> 1:31:33.260\n Anti communism is very hard for them to understand.\n\n1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:36.460\n The fact that in the 1950s,\n\n1:31:36.460 --> 1:31:39.060\n Americans believed that communists\n\n1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:40.660\n were going to infiltrate our society\n\n1:31:40.660 --> 1:31:41.820\n and many other societies.\n\n1:31:41.820 --> 1:31:46.380\n And that after Fidel Castro comes to power in 1959,\n\n1:31:46.380 --> 1:31:47.900\n that we're going to see communist regimes\n\n1:31:47.900 --> 1:31:49.740\n all across Latin America,\n\n1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:52.500\n that fear of communism married to nuclear power.\n\n1:31:53.620 --> 1:31:56.380\n And then even the fear that maybe economically\n\n1:31:56.380 --> 1:31:58.260\n they would outpace us because they would create\n\n1:31:58.260 --> 1:32:02.820\n this sort of army of Khrushchevian builders of things\n\n1:32:02.820 --> 1:32:04.300\n and what does Khrushchev said, right?\n\n1:32:04.300 --> 1:32:06.580\n Say we're gonna catch Britain in five years\n\n1:32:06.580 --> 1:32:08.620\n and then the United States after that, right?\n\n1:32:08.620 --> 1:32:11.540\n So to explain that sense of fear to them\n\n1:32:11.540 --> 1:32:14.300\n that they don't have of those others,\n\n1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:15.900\n that's really important.\n\n1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:19.860\n The Cold War was fundamentally about the United States\n\n1:32:19.860 --> 1:32:22.060\n defending a capitalist world order\n\n1:32:22.060 --> 1:32:24.940\n against a serious challenger from communism.\n\n1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:27.780\n An alternative way of organizing everything,\n\n1:32:27.780 --> 1:32:30.660\n private property, economic activity,\n\n1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:32.780\n enterprise, life, everything,\n\n1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.300\n organized in a totally different way.\n\n1:32:34.300 --> 1:32:36.940\n It was a struggle between two systems.\n\n1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:38.580\n So your sense is, and sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:32:38.580 --> 1:32:41.820\n but your sense is that the conflict of the Cold War\n\n1:32:41.820 --> 1:32:43.780\n was between two ideologies\n\n1:32:44.780 --> 1:32:48.460\n and not just two big countries with nuclear weapons.\n\n1:32:48.460 --> 1:32:49.980\n I think it was about two different ways of life\n\n1:32:49.980 --> 1:32:52.620\n or two different promoted ways of life.\n\n1:32:52.620 --> 1:32:56.380\n The Soviet Union never actually lived communism.\n\n1:32:56.380 --> 1:32:58.780\n But I think my reading of Stalin\n\n1:32:58.780 --> 1:33:00.380\n is he really tried to go there.\n\n1:33:00.380 --> 1:33:02.620\n Khrushchev really believed Gorbachev\n\n1:33:02.620 --> 1:33:04.460\n thought he was going to reform the Soviet Union\n\n1:33:04.460 --> 1:33:07.020\n so you would go back to a kind of Bukhar and Lenin\n\n1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:08.260\n communism, right?\n\n1:33:08.260 --> 1:33:10.380\n So I do think that mattered.\n\n1:33:10.380 --> 1:33:11.660\n I do think that mattered enormously.\n\n1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:13.860\n And for the United States point of view,\n\n1:33:13.860 --> 1:33:16.820\n the view was that communism and fascism\n\n1:33:16.820 --> 1:33:18.860\n were these totalitarian threats\n\n1:33:18.860 --> 1:33:21.340\n to liberal democracy and capitalism,\n\n1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:22.700\n which went hand in hand.\n\n1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:24.540\n So I do think that's what the struggle was about.\n\n1:33:24.540 --> 1:33:26.580\n And in a certain way, liberal capitalism\n\n1:33:26.580 --> 1:33:28.340\n proved to be the more enduring system\n\n1:33:28.340 --> 1:33:30.980\n and the United States played a key role in that.\n\n1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:33.580\n That's the reality of the Cold War.\n\n1:33:33.580 --> 1:33:35.220\n But I think it means different things now\n\n1:33:35.220 --> 1:33:38.140\n to my students and others.\n\n1:33:38.140 --> 1:33:43.140\n They focus very much on the expansion of American power\n\n1:33:43.980 --> 1:33:46.060\n and the challenges of managing.\n\n1:33:47.180 --> 1:33:49.340\n They're looking at it from the perspective\n\n1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:51.980\n of not will we survive,\n\n1:33:51.980 --> 1:33:54.820\n but did we waste our resources on some elements of it?\n\n1:33:54.820 --> 1:33:57.540\n It doesn't mean they were against what America did,\n\n1:33:57.540 --> 1:33:59.260\n but there is a question of the resources\n\n1:33:59.260 --> 1:34:02.580\n that went into the Cold War and the opportunity costs.\n\n1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:04.860\n And you see this when you look at the sort of\n\n1:34:04.860 --> 1:34:06.740\n healthcare systems that other countries build\n\n1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:10.780\n and you compare them to the United States, race issues also.\n\n1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:12.220\n So they look at the costs,\n\n1:34:12.220 --> 1:34:14.900\n which I think often happens after a project is done,\n\n1:34:14.900 --> 1:34:16.420\n you look back at that.\n\n1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:19.900\n Second, I think they're also more inclined\n\n1:34:19.900 --> 1:34:23.460\n to see the world as less bipolar,\n\n1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:26.700\n to see the role of China as more complicated.\n\n1:34:26.700 --> 1:34:29.900\n Post colonial or anti colonial movements,\n\n1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:32.220\n independent states in Africa and Latin America,\n\n1:34:32.220 --> 1:34:34.140\n that gets more attention.\n\n1:34:34.140 --> 1:34:39.140\n So one of the criticisms now is because you forget\n\n1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:42.220\n the lessons of 20th century history\n\n1:34:42.220 --> 1:34:45.380\n and the atrocities committed under communism,\n\n1:34:45.380 --> 1:34:48.500\n that you may be a little bit more willing\n\n1:34:48.500 --> 1:34:52.260\n to accept some of those ideologies\n\n1:34:52.260 --> 1:34:54.700\n into our United States society.\n\n1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:59.700\n That this kind of, that forgetting that capitalistic forces\n\n1:35:00.100 --> 1:35:05.100\n are part of the reason why we have what we have today.\n\n1:35:05.940 --> 1:35:10.940\n There's a fear amongst some now that we would have,\n\n1:35:11.780 --> 1:35:14.980\n what would allow basically communism\n\n1:35:14.980 --> 1:35:17.700\n to take hold in America.\n\n1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:20.740\n I mean, Jordan and others speak to this kind of idea.\n\n1:35:20.740 --> 1:35:23.860\n I tend to not be so fearful of it.\n\n1:35:23.860 --> 1:35:27.780\n I think it's on the surface, it's not deep within.\n\n1:35:27.780 --> 1:35:30.460\n I do see the world as very complicated\n\n1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:34.340\n as there needing to be a role of having support\n\n1:35:34.340 --> 1:35:36.500\n for each other on certain political levels,\n\n1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:40.140\n economic levels, and then also supporting entrepreneurs.\n\n1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:45.140\n It's like that the kind of enforcing of outcomes\n\n1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:47.780\n that is fundamental to the communist system\n\n1:35:47.780 --> 1:35:50.100\n is not something we're actually close to.\n\n1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:52.020\n And some of that is just fear mongering\n\n1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:56.300\n for likes on Twitter kind of thing.\n\n1:35:56.300 --> 1:35:57.340\n If I could come in on that,\n\n1:35:57.340 --> 1:35:58.660\n because I agree with you 100%.\n\n1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:00.940\n I've spent a lot of time writing and looking at this\n\n1:36:00.940 --> 1:36:02.980\n and talking to people about this.\n\n1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:04.980\n There's no communism in the United States.\n\n1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:07.380\n There never has been, and there certainly isn't now.\n\n1:36:07.380 --> 1:36:09.980\n And I'll say this both from an academic point of view,\n\n1:36:09.980 --> 1:36:11.500\n but also from just spending a lot of time\n\n1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.380\n observing young people in the United States.\n\n1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:14.900\n Even those on the farthest left,\n\n1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:16.940\n take whoever you think is the farthest left,\n\n1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:18.660\n they don't even understand what communism is.\n\n1:36:18.660 --> 1:36:20.620\n They're not communist in any sense.\n\n1:36:20.620 --> 1:36:22.420\n Americans are raised in a vernacular\n\n1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:24.900\n and environment of private property ownership.\n\n1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:26.660\n And as you know better than anyone,\n\n1:36:26.660 --> 1:36:27.780\n if you believe in private property,\n\n1:36:27.780 --> 1:36:28.820\n you don't believe in communism.\n\n1:36:28.820 --> 1:36:33.820\n So the sort of Bernie Sanders kind of socialist elements,\n\n1:36:34.700 --> 1:36:36.660\n that's very different, right?\n\n1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:39.140\n And I would say some of that, not all of that,\n\n1:36:39.140 --> 1:36:40.540\n some of that does hearken back\n\n1:36:40.540 --> 1:36:42.780\n to actually what won in the Cold War.\n\n1:36:42.780 --> 1:36:45.020\n There were many social democratic elements\n\n1:36:45.020 --> 1:36:46.220\n of what the United States did\n\n1:36:46.220 --> 1:36:48.020\n that led to our winning the Cold War.\n\n1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:53.020\n For example, the New Deal was investing government money\n\n1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:57.220\n in propping up business, in propping up labor unions.\n\n1:36:57.220 --> 1:37:00.180\n And during the Cold War, we spent more money\n\n1:37:00.180 --> 1:37:03.660\n than we had ever spent in our history on infrastructure,\n\n1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:08.660\n on schools, on providing social support, social security,\n\n1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:11.780\n our national pension system being one of them.\n\n1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:15.260\n So you could argue actually that social democracy\n\n1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:17.740\n is very compatible with capitalism.\n\n1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:19.500\n And I think that's the debate we're having today,\n\n1:37:19.500 --> 1:37:20.620\n how much social democracy.\n\n1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:22.940\n I'll also say that the capitalism we've experienced\n\n1:37:22.940 --> 1:37:24.700\n the last 20 years is different\n\n1:37:24.700 --> 1:37:26.900\n from the capitalism of the Cold War.\n\n1:37:26.900 --> 1:37:28.980\n During the Cold War, there was the presumption\n\n1:37:28.980 --> 1:37:33.980\n in the United States that you had to pay taxes\n\n1:37:35.420 --> 1:37:38.180\n to support our Cold War activities,\n\n1:37:38.180 --> 1:37:40.340\n that it was okay to make money,\n\n1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:43.740\n but the more money you made, the more taxes you had to pay.\n\n1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:45.500\n We had the highest marginal tax rates\n\n1:37:45.500 --> 1:37:47.860\n in our history during the Cold War.\n\n1:37:47.860 --> 1:37:50.620\n Now, the aversion to taxes,\n\n1:37:50.620 --> 1:37:52.260\n and of course, no one ever likes paying taxes,\n\n1:37:52.260 --> 1:37:55.060\n but the notion that we can do things on deficit spending,\n\n1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:58.020\n that's a post Cold War phenomenon.\n\n1:37:58.020 --> 1:37:59.540\n That's not a Cold War phenomenon.\n\n1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:02.300\n So, so much of the capitalism that we're talking about today\n\n1:38:02.300 --> 1:38:03.780\n is not the capitalism of the Cold War.\n\n1:38:03.780 --> 1:38:05.660\n And maybe, again, we can learn that\n\n1:38:05.660 --> 1:38:09.900\n and see how we can reform capitalism today\n\n1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:13.500\n and get rid of this false worry\n\n1:38:13.500 --> 1:38:14.900\n about communism in the United States.\n\n1:38:14.900 --> 1:38:15.740\n Yeah, you know what?\n\n1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.380\n You make me actually realize something important.\n\n1:38:17.380 --> 1:38:20.060\n What we have to remember is the words we use\n\n1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:21.860\n on the surface about different policies,\n\n1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:23.900\n what you think is right and wrong,\n\n1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:28.300\n is actually different than the core thing\n\n1:38:28.300 --> 1:38:32.820\n that is in your blood, the core ideas that are there.\n\n1:38:33.740 --> 1:38:36.420\n I do see the United States as this,\n\n1:38:36.420 --> 1:38:41.260\n there's this fire that burns of individual freedoms,\n\n1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:46.260\n of property rights, these basic foundational ideas\n\n1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:50.820\n that everybody just kind of takes for granted.\n\n1:38:50.820 --> 1:38:53.220\n And I think if you hold on to them,\n\n1:38:54.220 --> 1:38:57.060\n if you're like raised in them,\n\n1:38:57.060 --> 1:39:00.740\n talking about ideas of social security,\n\n1:39:00.740 --> 1:39:05.740\n of universal basic income, of reallocation of resources\n\n1:39:05.740 --> 1:39:08.380\n is a fundamentally different kind of discussion\n\n1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:10.700\n than you had in the Soviet Union.\n\n1:39:10.700 --> 1:39:13.420\n I think the value of the individual\n\n1:39:13.420 --> 1:39:16.460\n is so core to the American system\n\n1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:21.300\n that you basically cannot possibly do the kind of atrocities\n\n1:39:21.300 --> 1:39:25.100\n that you saw in the Soviet Union.\n\n1:39:25.100 --> 1:39:26.860\n But, of course, you never know,\n\n1:39:26.860 --> 1:39:30.620\n the slippery slope has a way of changing things.\n\n1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:33.100\n But I do believe the things you're born with\n\n1:39:33.100 --> 1:39:34.940\n is just so core to this country.\n\n1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:38.420\n It's part of the, I don't know what your thoughts are.\n\n1:39:38.420 --> 1:39:42.180\n We are in Texas, I'm not necessarily,\n\n1:39:42.180 --> 1:39:43.420\n I don't necessarily wanna have\n\n1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:45.340\n a gun control type of conversation,\n\n1:39:45.340 --> 1:39:48.580\n but the reason I really like guns,\n\n1:39:50.380 --> 1:39:53.980\n it doesn't make any sense, but philosophically,\n\n1:39:53.980 --> 1:39:58.620\n it's such a declaration of individual rights\n\n1:39:58.620 --> 1:40:01.780\n that's so different than the conversations I hear\n\n1:40:01.780 --> 1:40:04.460\n with my Russian family and my Russian friends,\n\n1:40:04.460 --> 1:40:06.420\n that the gun, it's very possible\n\n1:40:06.420 --> 1:40:08.660\n that having guns is bad for society\n\n1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:11.580\n in the sense that it will lead to more violence.\n\n1:40:11.580 --> 1:40:13.900\n But there's something about this discussion\n\n1:40:20.260 --> 1:40:24.660\n that proclaims the value of my freedom as an individual.\n\n1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:26.300\n I'm not being eloquent in it,\n\n1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:28.740\n but there's very few debates\n\n1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:30.340\n where whenever people are saying,\n\n1:40:30.340 --> 1:40:32.300\n should you have what level of gun control,\n\n1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:34.380\n all those kinds of things,\n\n1:40:34.380 --> 1:40:39.380\n what I hear is it's a fight for how much freedom,\n\n1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:44.180\n even if it's stupid freedom, should the individual have.\n\n1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:46.620\n I think that's what's articulated quite often.\n\n1:40:46.620 --> 1:40:49.980\n I think combining your two points, which are great points,\n\n1:40:49.980 --> 1:40:52.700\n I think there is something about American individualism\n\n1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:56.620\n which is deeply ingrained in our culture and our society.\n\n1:40:56.620 --> 1:40:58.860\n And it means that the kinds of bad things\n\n1:40:58.860 --> 1:41:01.460\n that happen are different, usually not as bad.\n\n1:41:01.460 --> 1:41:04.300\n But our individualism often covers up\n\n1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:08.900\n for vigilante activity and individual violence\n\n1:41:08.900 --> 1:41:10.100\n toward people that you wouldn't have\n\n1:41:10.100 --> 1:41:11.980\n in a more collective culture.\n\n1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:14.060\n So in the Soviet Union, it was at a much worse scale\n\n1:41:14.060 --> 1:41:17.220\n and it was done by government organizations.\n\n1:41:17.220 --> 1:41:19.340\n In the United States, it's individuals,\n\n1:41:19.340 --> 1:41:22.020\n the history of lynching in our country, for example.\n\n1:41:22.020 --> 1:41:23.980\n Sometimes it's individual police officers,\n\n1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:24.980\n sometimes it's others.\n\n1:41:24.980 --> 1:41:27.300\n Again, the vast majority of police officers are good people\n\n1:41:27.300 --> 1:41:30.260\n and don't do harm to people, but there are these examples\n\n1:41:30.260 --> 1:41:33.740\n and they are able to fester in our society\n\n1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:34.780\n because of our individualism.\n\n1:41:34.780 --> 1:41:37.940\n Now, gun ownership is about personal freedom,\n\n1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:39.620\n I think, for a lot of people.\n\n1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:42.780\n And there's no doubt that in our history,\n\n1:41:42.780 --> 1:41:44.420\n included in the Second Amendment,\n\n1:41:44.420 --> 1:41:46.300\n which can be interpreted in different ways,\n\n1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:48.260\n is the presumption that people should have the right\n\n1:41:48.260 --> 1:41:49.220\n to defend themselves,\n\n1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:51.020\n which is what I think you're getting at here.\n\n1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:53.300\n That you should not be completely dependent\n\n1:41:53.300 --> 1:41:55.780\n for your defense on an entity\n\n1:41:55.780 --> 1:41:56.860\n that might not be there for you.\n\n1:41:56.860 --> 1:41:59.500\n You should be able to defend yourself.\n\n1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:01.620\n And guns symbolize that.\n\n1:42:01.620 --> 1:42:03.620\n I think that's a fair point.\n\n1:42:03.620 --> 1:42:06.100\n But I think it's also a fair point to say\n\n1:42:06.100 --> 1:42:08.140\n that as with everything,\n\n1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:10.700\n defining what self defense is, is really important.\n\n1:42:10.700 --> 1:42:13.540\n So does self defense mean I can have a bazooka?\n\n1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:16.020\n Does it mean I can have weapons that are designed\n\n1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:19.020\n for a military battlefield to mass kill people?\n\n1:42:19.020 --> 1:42:21.340\n That seems to me to be very different\n\n1:42:21.340 --> 1:42:23.060\n from saying I should have a handgun\n\n1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:26.340\n or some small arm to defend myself.\n\n1:42:26.340 --> 1:42:28.620\n That distinction alone would make a huge difference.\n\n1:42:28.620 --> 1:42:31.820\n Most of the mass shootings, at least,\n\n1:42:31.820 --> 1:42:34.500\n which are a smaller proportion of the larger gun deaths\n\n1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:35.540\n in the United States, which are larger\n\n1:42:35.540 --> 1:42:37.780\n than any other society, but at least the mass shootings\n\n1:42:37.780 --> 1:42:39.100\n are usually perpetrated by people\n\n1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:41.260\n who have not self defense weapons,\n\n1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:43.460\n but mass killing, mass killing weapons.\n\n1:42:43.460 --> 1:42:45.660\n And I think there's an important distinction there.\n\n1:42:45.660 --> 1:42:47.460\n The Constitution talks about a right to bear arms\n\n1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:49.100\n for a well regulated militia.\n\n1:42:49.100 --> 1:42:51.300\n When the framers talked about arms,\n\n1:42:51.300 --> 1:42:53.180\n that did not mean the ability to kill\n\n1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:55.140\n as many people as you wanna kill.\n\n1:42:55.140 --> 1:42:56.500\n It meant the ability to defend yourself.\n\n1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:57.740\n So let's have that conversation.\n\n1:42:57.740 --> 1:42:59.500\n I think it would be useful as a society.\n\n1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:02.060\n Stop talking about guns or no guns.\n\n1:43:02.060 --> 1:43:04.180\n What is it that we as citizens need\n\n1:43:04.180 --> 1:43:05.740\n to feel we can defend ourselves?\n\n1:43:05.740 --> 1:43:06.740\n Yes.\n\n1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:09.180\n Yeah, I mean, guns have this complicated issue\n\n1:43:09.180 --> 1:43:11.060\n that it can cause harm to others.\n\n1:43:11.060 --> 1:43:15.140\n I tend to see sort of maybe like legalization of drugs.\n\n1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:19.100\n I tend to believe that we should have the freedom\n\n1:43:19.100 --> 1:43:20.620\n to do stupid things.\n\n1:43:20.620 --> 1:43:23.420\n Yeah, so long as we're not harming lots of other people.\n\n1:43:23.420 --> 1:43:25.740\n Yes, and then guns, of course, have the property\n\n1:43:25.740 --> 1:43:26.900\n that they can be used.\n\n1:43:26.900 --> 1:43:30.660\n It's not just a bazooka I would argue is pretty stupid\n\n1:43:30.660 --> 1:43:32.820\n to own for your own self defense,\n\n1:43:32.820 --> 1:43:35.380\n but it has the very negative side effect\n\n1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:38.540\n of being potentially used to harm other people.\n\n1:43:38.540 --> 1:43:42.420\n And you have to consider that kind of stuff.\n\n1:43:42.420 --> 1:43:45.180\n By the way, as a side note to the listeners,\n\n1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:47.180\n there's been a bunch of people saying\n\n1:43:47.180 --> 1:43:50.980\n that Lex is way too libertarian for my taste.\n\n1:43:50.980 --> 1:43:54.900\n No, I actually am just struggling with ideas\n\n1:43:54.900 --> 1:43:57.380\n and sometimes put on different hats in these conversations.\n\n1:43:57.380 --> 1:43:59.620\n I think through different ideas,\n\n1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:02.080\n whether they're left, right or libertarian.\n\n1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:03.300\n That's true for gun control.\n\n1:44:03.300 --> 1:44:04.500\n That's true for immigration.\n\n1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:05.980\n That's true for all of that.\n\n1:44:05.980 --> 1:44:10.220\n I think we should have discussions in the space of ideas\n\n1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:13.020\n versus in the space of bins we put each other in labels\n\n1:44:13.020 --> 1:44:13.860\n and we put each other in.\n\n1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:15.100\n I agree 100%.\n\n1:44:15.100 --> 1:44:17.460\n And also change our minds all the time.\n\n1:44:18.700 --> 1:44:23.220\n Try out, say stupid stuff with the best of intention,\n\n1:44:23.220 --> 1:44:25.460\n trying our best to think through it.\n\n1:44:25.460 --> 1:44:29.020\n And then after saying it, think about it for a few days\n\n1:44:29.020 --> 1:44:31.420\n and then change your mind and grow in this way.\n\n1:44:32.780 --> 1:44:35.020\n Let me ask a ridiculous question.\n\n1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:38.220\n When you zoom out, when human civilization\n\n1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:41.560\n has destroyed itself and alien graduate students\n\n1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.460\n are studying it like three, four, five centuries from now,\n\n1:44:46.460 --> 1:44:47.720\n what do you think we'll remember\n\n1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:50.520\n about this period in history?\n\n1:44:50.520 --> 1:44:55.300\n The 20th century, the 21st century, this time.\n\n1:44:55.300 --> 1:44:57.900\n We had a couple of wars.\n\n1:44:57.900 --> 1:45:02.140\n We had a charismatic black president in the United States.\n\n1:45:02.140 --> 1:45:06.020\n We had a couple of pandemics.\n\n1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:11.020\n What do you think will actually stand out in history?\n\n1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:15.740\n No doubt the rapid technological innovation\n\n1:45:15.740 --> 1:45:18.220\n of the last 20 to 30 years.\n\n1:45:18.220 --> 1:45:21.820\n How we created a whole virtual universe\n\n1:45:21.820 --> 1:45:23.260\n we didn't have before.\n\n1:45:23.260 --> 1:45:25.060\n And of course that's gonna go in directions\n\n1:45:25.060 --> 1:45:27.460\n you and I can't imagine 50 years from now.\n\n1:45:27.460 --> 1:45:29.360\n But this will be seen as that origin moment\n\n1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:31.920\n that when we went from playing below the rim\n\n1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:33.260\n to playing above the rim, right?\n\n1:45:33.260 --> 1:45:37.140\n To be all in person to having a whole virtual world.\n\n1:45:37.140 --> 1:45:41.060\n And in a strange way, the pandemic was a provocation\n\n1:45:41.060 --> 1:45:43.240\n to move even further in that direction.\n\n1:45:43.240 --> 1:45:44.940\n And we're never going back, right?\n\n1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:46.780\n We're gonna restore some of the things we were doing\n\n1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:48.580\n before the pandemic, but we're never gonna go back\n\n1:45:48.580 --> 1:45:50.580\n to that world we were in before where every meeting\n\n1:45:50.580 --> 1:45:53.280\n you had to fly to that place to be in the room\n\n1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:54.620\n with the people.\n\n1:45:54.620 --> 1:45:57.060\n So this whole virtual world and the virtual personas\n\n1:45:57.060 --> 1:46:00.020\n and the avatars and all of that,\n\n1:46:00.020 --> 1:46:02.600\n I think that's going to be a big part\n\n1:46:02.600 --> 1:46:03.880\n of how people remember our time.\n\n1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:06.820\n Also the sort of biotechnology element of it,\n\n1:46:06.820 --> 1:46:10.080\n which the vaccines are part of.\n\n1:46:10.080 --> 1:46:12.740\n It's amazing how quickly, this is the great triumph,\n\n1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:15.940\n how quickly we've produced and distributed these vaccines.\n\n1:46:15.940 --> 1:46:18.020\n And of course there are problems with who's taking them,\n\n1:46:18.020 --> 1:46:22.180\n but the reality is, I mean, this is light speed\n\n1:46:22.180 --> 1:46:23.780\n compared to what it would have been like,\n\n1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:26.580\n not just in 1918, in 1980.\n\n1:46:26.580 --> 1:46:28.940\n Yeah, one of the, I'm sorry if I'm interrupting,\n\n1:46:28.940 --> 1:46:30.760\n but one of the disappointing things\n\n1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:33.660\n about this particular time is because vaccines,\n\n1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:37.400\n like a lot of things got politicized,\n\n1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:40.700\n used as little pawns in the game of politics,\n\n1:46:40.700 --> 1:46:44.420\n that we don't get the chance to step back fully at least\n\n1:46:44.420 --> 1:46:49.220\n and celebrate the brilliance of the human species.\n\n1:46:49.220 --> 1:46:50.060\n That's right.\n\n1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:55.780\n Yes, there are scientists who use their authority\n\n1:46:55.780 --> 1:46:59.840\n improperly, that have an ego,\n\n1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:04.840\n that when they're within institutions,\n\n1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:06.900\n are dishonest with the public\n\n1:47:06.900 --> 1:47:09.340\n because they don't trust the intelligence of the public,\n\n1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:11.320\n they are not authentic and transparent,\n\n1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:13.080\n all the same things you could say about humans\n\n1:47:13.080 --> 1:47:15.420\n in any positions of power, anywhere.\n\n1:47:15.420 --> 1:47:18.980\n Okay, that doesn't mean science isn't incredible\n\n1:47:18.980 --> 1:47:23.520\n and the vaccines, I mean, I don't often talk about it\n\n1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:27.800\n because it's so political and it's heartbreaking to,\n\n1:47:28.660 --> 1:47:31.180\n it's heartbreaking how all the good stuff\n\n1:47:31.180 --> 1:47:32.540\n is getting politicized.\n\n1:47:32.540 --> 1:47:34.240\n Yeah, that's right, and it shouldn't be,\n\n1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:36.580\n and it'll seem less political.\n\n1:47:36.580 --> 1:47:37.780\n Eating the long arc of history.\n\n1:47:37.780 --> 1:47:42.600\n Yep, it'll be seen as an outstanding accomplishment.\n\n1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:44.740\n And as a step toward whatever,\n\n1:47:44.740 --> 1:47:46.180\n maybe they're doing vaccines\n\n1:47:46.180 --> 1:47:48.620\n or something that replaces the vaccine in 10 seconds,\n\n1:47:48.620 --> 1:47:49.700\n at that point, right?\n\n1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:50.700\n It'll be seen as a step.\n\n1:47:50.700 --> 1:47:52.240\n Those will be some of the positives.\n\n1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:54.100\n I think one of the negatives they will point to\n\n1:47:54.100 --> 1:47:58.420\n will be our inability, at least at this moment,\n\n1:47:58.420 --> 1:48:00.460\n to manage our environment better,\n\n1:48:00.460 --> 1:48:02.740\n how we're destroying our living space\n\n1:48:02.740 --> 1:48:05.100\n and not doing enough even though we have the capabilities\n\n1:48:05.100 --> 1:48:06.260\n to do more to preserve\n\n1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:09.300\n or at least allow a sustainable living space.\n\n1:48:09.300 --> 1:48:11.740\n I'm confident because I'm an optimist\n\n1:48:11.740 --> 1:48:12.780\n that we will get through this\n\n1:48:12.780 --> 1:48:15.300\n and we will be better at sustaining our environment\n\n1:48:15.300 --> 1:48:16.700\n in future decades.\n\n1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:18.820\n And so in terms of environmental policy,\n\n1:48:18.820 --> 1:48:21.540\n they'll see this moment as a dark age\n\n1:48:21.540 --> 1:48:24.760\n or the beginnings of a better age, maybe as a renaissance.\n\n1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:31.180\n Or maybe as the last time most people lived on Earth\n\n1:48:31.340 --> 1:48:33.300\n when a couple of centuries afterwards\n\n1:48:33.300 --> 1:48:36.300\n we were all dissipated throughout the solar system\n\n1:48:36.300 --> 1:48:37.260\n and the galaxy.\n\n1:48:37.260 --> 1:48:38.100\n Very possible.\n\n1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:41.120\n If the local resident, hometown resident,\n\n1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:43.640\n Mr. Elon Musk has anything to do with it.\n\n1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:49.140\n I do tend to think you're absolutely right.\n\n1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:51.020\n With all this political bickering,\n\n1:48:51.020 --> 1:48:55.020\n we shouldn't forget that what this age will be remembered by\n\n1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:57.360\n is the incredible levels of innovation.\n\n1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:02.360\n I do think the biotech stuff worries me more than anything\n\n1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:04.640\n because it feels like there's a lot of weapons\n\n1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:06.780\n that could be yet to be developed in that space.\n\n1:49:06.780 --> 1:49:09.860\n But I tend to believe that,\n\n1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:11.720\n I'm excited by two avenues.\n\n1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:13.420\n One is artificial intelligence.\n\n1:49:16.900 --> 1:49:19.660\n The kind of systems we'll create in this digital space\n\n1:49:19.660 --> 1:49:21.260\n that you mentioned we're moving to.\n\n1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:23.140\n And then the other, of course,\n\n1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:24.820\n this could be the product of the Cold War,\n\n1:49:24.820 --> 1:49:27.620\n but I'm super excited by space exploration.\n\n1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:30.380\n There's a magic to humans being.\n\n1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:31.320\n And we're getting back to it.\n\n1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:34.380\n I mean, we were enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s\n\n1:49:34.380 --> 1:49:35.780\n when it was a Cold War competition.\n\n1:49:35.780 --> 1:49:38.260\n And then after the 70s, we sort of gave up on it.\n\n1:49:38.260 --> 1:49:40.100\n And thanks to Elon Musk and others,\n\n1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:41.700\n we're coming back to this issue.\n\n1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:44.860\n And I think there's so much to be gained\n\n1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:46.440\n from the power of exploration.\n\n1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:50.060\n Is there books or movies in your life,\n\n1:49:50.060 --> 1:49:53.060\n long ago or recently, that had a big impact on you?\n\n1:49:53.060 --> 1:49:53.900\n Yes.\n\n1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:54.720\n Is there something you would?\n\n1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:55.560\n Yes.\n\n1:49:56.740 --> 1:49:58.740\n My favorite novel, I always tell people this,\n\n1:49:58.740 --> 1:49:59.660\n I love reading novels.\n\n1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:01.120\n I'm a historian.\n\n1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:03.900\n And I think the historian and the novelist are actually,\n\n1:50:03.900 --> 1:50:06.240\n and the technology innovator are all actually\n\n1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:07.080\n one and the same.\n\n1:50:07.080 --> 1:50:08.860\n They're all storytellers.\n\n1:50:08.860 --> 1:50:11.460\n And we're all in the imagination space.\n\n1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:14.460\n And I'm trying to imagine the world of the past\n\n1:50:14.460 --> 1:50:16.760\n to inform us in the present for the future.\n\n1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:18.780\n So one of my favorite novels that I read,\n\n1:50:18.780 --> 1:50:20.220\n actually when I was in graduate school,\n\n1:50:20.220 --> 1:50:23.040\n is Thomas Mann's Buddenbrooks.\n\n1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:26.220\n And it's the story of a family in L\u00fcbeck\n\n1:50:26.220 --> 1:50:29.180\n in Northern Germany, living through the 19th century\n\n1:50:29.180 --> 1:50:31.780\n and the rise and fall of family, cycles of life.\n\n1:50:31.780 --> 1:50:34.420\n Many things we've talked about in the last couple of hours.\n\n1:50:34.420 --> 1:50:38.740\n Cycles of life, challenges of adjusting\n\n1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:39.680\n to the world around you.\n\n1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:42.420\n And it's just a very moving reflection\n\n1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:44.300\n on the limits of human agency\n\n1:50:44.300 --> 1:50:47.500\n and how we all have to understand the circumstances\n\n1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:49.140\n we're in and adjust to them.\n\n1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:51.660\n And there's triumph and tragedy in that.\n\n1:50:51.660 --> 1:50:52.600\n It's a wonderful novel.\n\n1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:54.260\n It used to be a kind of canonical work.\n\n1:50:54.260 --> 1:50:55.580\n It's sort of fallen out now.\n\n1:50:55.580 --> 1:50:59.240\n It's a big, big novel, but I'm very moved by that.\n\n1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.020\n I'm very moved by Tall Stories, War and Peace.\n\n1:51:01.020 --> 1:51:03.020\n I assign that every year to my students.\n\n1:51:03.020 --> 1:51:04.740\n That's a big, big book.\n\n1:51:04.740 --> 1:51:07.300\n But what Tall Story challenges\n\n1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:08.940\n is he challenges the notion\n\n1:51:08.940 --> 1:51:11.100\n that a Napoleon can rule the world.\n\n1:51:11.100 --> 1:51:12.720\n And we're all little Napoleons, right?\n\n1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:15.180\n We're all sort of thinking that we're gonna do that.\n\n1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:18.180\n And he reminds us how much is contingency, circumstance.\n\n1:51:18.180 --> 1:51:21.000\n It doesn't mean we don't have some control.\n\n1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.640\n You've spoke to me a little bit of Russian.\n\n1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:24.740\n Where does that come from?\n\n1:51:24.740 --> 1:51:26.940\n So your appreciation of Tall Story,\n\n1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:28.840\n but also your ability to speak a bit of Russian.\n\n1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:30.040\n Where's that from?\n\n1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:32.020\n So I speak, in addition to English,\n\n1:51:32.020 --> 1:51:34.500\n I speak reasonably well,\n\n1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:36.820\n depending on how much vodka I've had.\n\n1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:39.420\n Russian, I speak French and German.\n\n1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:42.960\n I learned those for research purposes.\n\n1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:44.620\n I learned French actually when I was in high school,\n\n1:51:44.620 --> 1:51:45.900\n Russian when I was in college,\n\n1:51:45.900 --> 1:51:47.760\n German when I was in graduate school.\n\n1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:49.860\n Now I do have family on my mother's side\n\n1:51:49.860 --> 1:51:51.660\n that's of Russian Jewish extraction,\n\n1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:55.220\n but they were Yiddish speakers by the time I met them.\n\n1:51:55.220 --> 1:51:56.700\n By the time they had gone through Germany\n\n1:51:56.700 --> 1:51:57.580\n and come to the United States,\n\n1:51:57.580 --> 1:51:59.140\n or really gone through Poland and come to the United States,\n\n1:51:59.140 --> 1:52:00.020\n they were Yiddish speakers.\n\n1:52:00.020 --> 1:52:02.500\n So there's no one really in my family who speaks Russian,\n\n1:52:02.500 --> 1:52:04.060\n but I do feel a connection there,\n\n1:52:04.060 --> 1:52:07.280\n at least a long range personal connection.\n\n1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:09.660\n Is there something to be said about the language\n\n1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:12.780\n and your ability to imagine history?\n\n1:52:12.780 --> 1:52:17.160\n Sort of when you study these different countries,\n\n1:52:17.160 --> 1:52:19.440\n your ability to imagine what it was like\n\n1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.440\n to be a part of that culture, part of that time?\n\n1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:27.580\n Yes, language is crucial to understanding a culture.\n\n1:52:27.580 --> 1:52:30.620\n And even if you learn the languages I have,\n\n1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:32.440\n learning Russian and German and French,\n\n1:52:32.440 --> 1:52:33.280\n it's still not the same\n\n1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:36.340\n as also being a native speaker either, as you know.\n\n1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:39.420\n But I think language tells you a lot about mannerism,\n\n1:52:39.420 --> 1:52:40.600\n about assumptions.\n\n1:52:41.940 --> 1:52:46.780\n The very fact that English doesn't have a formal U,\n\n1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:48.380\n but Russian has a formal U, right?\n\n1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:49.820\n V versus T, right?\n\n1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:53.160\n German has a formal U, Z versus D, right?\n\n1:52:53.160 --> 1:52:56.380\n So the fact that English doesn't have a formal U\n\n1:52:56.380 --> 1:52:59.140\n tells you something about Americans, right?\n\n1:52:59.140 --> 1:53:01.020\n And that's just one example.\n\n1:53:01.020 --> 1:53:06.020\n The fact that Germans have such a wider vocabulary\n\n1:53:07.300 --> 1:53:10.500\n for certain scientific concepts than we have in English\n\n1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:12.100\n tells you something about the culture, right?\n\n1:53:12.100 --> 1:53:14.980\n Language is an artifact of the culture.\n\n1:53:14.980 --> 1:53:16.340\n The culture makes the language.\n\n1:53:16.340 --> 1:53:17.420\n It's fascinating to explore.\n\n1:53:17.420 --> 1:53:19.720\n I mean, even just exactly what you just said,\n\n1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:24.720\n V, T, which is, there's a fascinating transition.\n\n1:53:26.680 --> 1:53:28.720\n So I guess in English we just have U.\n\n1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:33.720\n There's a fascinating transition that persists to this day\n\n1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:38.040\n is of formalism and politeness,\n\n1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:41.520\n where it's an initial kind of dance of interaction\n\n1:53:41.520 --> 1:53:46.520\n that's different methods of signaling respect, I guess.\n\n1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:48.520\n We don't, and language provides that,\n\n1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:51.360\n and then in the English language,\n\n1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:53.640\n there's fewer tools to show that kind of respect,\n\n1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:56.200\n which has potentially positive or negative effects\n\n1:53:56.200 --> 1:53:59.040\n on, it flattens the society where like a teenager\n\n1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:04.040\n could talk to an older person and show like a deference.\n\n1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:06.920\n I mean, but at the same time,\n\n1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:09.240\n I mean, it creates a certain kind of dynamic,\n\n1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:10.920\n a certain kind of society.\n\n1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:13.560\n And it's funny to think of just like those few words\n\n1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:16.800\n can have like a ripple effect through the whole culture.\n\n1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:18.760\n And we don't have a history in the United States\n\n1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:20.600\n of aristocracy.\n\n1:54:20.600 --> 1:54:23.920\n These elements of language reflect aristocracy.\n\n1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:26.440\n The serf would never refer to the master,\n\n1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:27.960\n even if the master is younger,\n\n1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:29.600\n it's always Voi, right?\n\n1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:30.920\n In Turgenev, it's always Voi, right?\n\n1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:33.640\n I mean, and so it's, yeah,\n\n1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:34.960\n so it tells you something about the history.\n\n1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:37.160\n That's why to your question, which was a great question,\n\n1:54:37.160 --> 1:54:40.080\n it's so crucial to try to penetrate the language.\n\n1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:41.600\n I'll also say something else,\n\n1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:43.400\n and this is a problem for many Americans\n\n1:54:43.400 --> 1:54:44.440\n who haven't learned a foreign language.\n\n1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:46.480\n We're very bad at teaching foreign languages.\n\n1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:49.920\n If you've never taught yourself a foreign language,\n\n1:54:49.920 --> 1:54:53.200\n you have closed yourself off to certain kinds of empathy\n\n1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:55.640\n because you have basically trained your brain\n\n1:54:55.640 --> 1:54:57.840\n to only look at the world one way.\n\n1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:00.440\n The very act of learning another language,\n\n1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:05.040\n I think tells your brain that words and concepts\n\n1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:06.440\n don't translate one to one.\n\n1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:07.520\n This is the first thing you realize, right?\n\n1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:10.160\n We can say, you know, these two words mean this thing,\n\n1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:12.000\n you know, these two words mean the same thing\n\n1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.200\n from two languages, they never mean exactly the same thing.\n\n1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:18.320\n Dosvidanya is really not goodbye, right?\n\n1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:20.760\n And there's something, you know,\n\n1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:22.360\n right now there's people talking about\n\n1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.520\n idea of lived experience.\n\n1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:27.800\n One of the ways to force yourself into this idea\n\n1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:30.280\n of lived experience is by learning another language,\n\n1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.320\n to understand that you can perceive the world\n\n1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:33.360\n in a totally different way,\n\n1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:35.920\n even though you're perceiving the same thing.\n\n1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:38.400\n And of course, the way to first learn Russian\n\n1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:41.120\n for those looking for tutorial lessons for me\n\n1:55:41.120 --> 1:55:44.680\n is just like as you said, we start by drinking lots of vodka.\n\n1:55:44.680 --> 1:55:45.520\n Yes, of course.\n\n1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:48.040\n It's very difficult to do otherwise.\n\n1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:51.640\n Is there advice you have for young people about career,\n\n1:55:51.640 --> 1:55:56.640\n about life, in making their way in the world?\n\n1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:00.440\n Yes, two things I believe that I say\n\n1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:02.200\n to a lot of talented young people.\n\n1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:05.880\n First, I don't think you can predict\n\n1:56:05.880 --> 1:56:08.880\n what is gonna be well renumerated 20 years from now.\n\n1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:11.160\n Don't pick a profession because you think,\n\n1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:13.080\n even though your parents might tell you or something,\n\n1:56:13.080 --> 1:56:14.200\n do this and you'll make money.\n\n1:56:14.200 --> 1:56:16.240\n You know, this is the scene in The Graduate\n\n1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:17.760\n where a guy tells Dustin Hoffman,\n\n1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:20.360\n go into plastics, money in plastics.\n\n1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:21.200\n We don't know.\n\n1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:22.480\n So many of my students now have parents\n\n1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:25.360\n who are telling them, bright students, you know,\n\n1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:26.560\n go to the business school.\n\n1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:29.360\n That's what's gonna set you up to make money.\n\n1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:31.080\n If you're passionate about business, yes.\n\n1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:33.560\n But don't begin by thinking you know\n\n1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.480\n what's gonna be hot 20 years from now.\n\n1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:38.080\n You don't know what's gonna be hot from 20 years ago,\n\n1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:38.920\n 20 years from now.\n\n1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:39.760\n What should you do?\n\n1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:40.840\n This is advice number one.\n\n1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:43.000\n Find what you're passionate about.\n\n1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.160\n Because if you're passionate about it,\n\n1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:47.640\n you will do good work in that area if you're talented\n\n1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:50.280\n and usually passion and talent overlap.\n\n1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:52.800\n And you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it.\n\n1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:54.880\n I mean, you do it really well, people will wanna pay.\n\n1:56:54.880 --> 1:56:56.200\n That's where capitalism works.\n\n1:56:56.200 --> 1:56:57.920\n People will find it valuable, right?\n\n1:56:57.920 --> 1:57:00.000\n Whether it's violin playing, right?\n\n1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.320\n Or engineering or poetry, you will find,\n\n1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:03.920\n you might not become a billionaire.\n\n1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:05.160\n That involves other things.\n\n1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:07.400\n But you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it.\n\n1:57:07.400 --> 1:57:11.960\n And then the second thing is it's really important\n\n1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:13.440\n at the very beginning of your career,\n\n1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:16.520\n even before you're in your job, right?\n\n1:57:16.520 --> 1:57:18.320\n To start building your networks.\n\n1:57:18.320 --> 1:57:22.120\n But networks are not just people you're on Facebook with\n\n1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:24.640\n or Twitter with, I mean, that's fine.\n\n1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:26.720\n It's actually forming relationships.\n\n1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:28.720\n And some of that can be mediated in the digital world,\n\n1:57:28.720 --> 1:57:30.360\n but I mean real relationships.\n\n1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:31.880\n I like podcasts because I think\n\n1:57:31.880 --> 1:57:33.720\n they actually open up that space.\n\n1:57:33.720 --> 1:57:36.280\n I know a lot of people can listen to a podcast\n\n1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:38.760\n and find someone else who's listened to that podcast\n\n1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:40.440\n and have a conversation about a topic.\n\n1:57:40.440 --> 1:57:42.200\n It opens up that space.\n\n1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:43.800\n Build those relationships,\n\n1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:45.840\n not with people who you think will be powerful,\n\n1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.320\n but people you think are interesting\n\n1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:50.480\n because they'll do interesting things.\n\n1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:54.840\n And every successful person I know at some level\n\n1:57:54.840 --> 1:57:57.440\n had a key moment where they got where they are\n\n1:57:57.440 --> 1:58:00.120\n because of someone they knew for some other reason\n\n1:58:00.120 --> 1:58:01.160\n who had that connection.\n\n1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:03.760\n So use and spread your networks\n\n1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:05.200\n and make them as diverse as possible.\n\n1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:08.080\n Find people who are of a different party,\n\n1:58:08.080 --> 1:58:10.680\n have different interests, but are interesting to you.\n\n1:58:11.800 --> 1:58:12.640\n That's brilliant advice.\n\n1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:15.160\n And some of that on the passion side,\n\n1:58:15.160 --> 1:58:19.840\n I do find that as somebody who has a lot of passions,\n\n1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:26.320\n I find the second part to that is committing.\n\n1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:28.560\n Yes, that's true too.\n\n1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:32.000\n Which sucks because life is finite.\n\n1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.200\n And when you commit, you say,\n\n1:58:34.200 --> 1:58:37.960\n well, I'm never going to be good.\n\n1:58:37.960 --> 1:58:40.400\n Like when you choose one of the two passions,\n\n1:58:40.400 --> 1:58:42.400\n one of the two things you're interested in,\n\n1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:45.320\n you're basically saying, I'm letting go.\n\n1:58:45.320 --> 1:58:47.560\n I'm saying goodbye to.\n\n1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:48.400\n That's true.\n\n1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:49.240\n That's true.\n\n1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:50.160\n Which is actually what does goodbye means,\n\n1:58:50.160 --> 1:58:51.320\n not goodbye, but letting go.\n\n1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:52.520\n That's exactly right.\n\n1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:53.640\n I think that's exactly right.\n\n1:58:53.640 --> 1:58:55.480\n I think you do have to make choices.\n\n1:58:55.480 --> 1:58:56.800\n You do have to set priorities.\n\n1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:58.560\n I often laugh at students who tell me\n\n1:58:58.560 --> 1:59:00.560\n they want to have like three majors.\n\n1:59:00.560 --> 1:59:02.120\n If you have three majors, you have no major, right?\n\n1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:04.680\n I mean, so I do think you have to make choices.\n\n1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:09.680\n I also think it's important that whatever you do,\n\n1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:11.840\n even if it's a small thing,\n\n1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:13.760\n you always do the best you can.\n\n1:59:13.760 --> 1:59:15.520\n You always do excellent work.\n\n1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:17.440\n My kids are tired of hearing me say this at home,\n\n1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:21.200\n but I believe everything you do should be about excellence.\n\n1:59:21.200 --> 1:59:22.600\n The best you can do.\n\n1:59:22.600 --> 1:59:23.560\n If I'm going to wash the dishes,\n\n1:59:23.560 --> 1:59:26.120\n I'm going to be the best person washing the dishes.\n\n1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:28.000\n If I'm going to write a book review,\n\n1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.120\n I'm going to write the best possible book review I can.\n\n1:59:30.120 --> 1:59:30.960\n Why?\n\n1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:33.920\n Because you develop a culture about yourself,\n\n1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:35.480\n which is about excellence.\n\n1:59:35.480 --> 1:59:39.040\n Yeah, I was telling you offline about all the kind of stuff,\n\n1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:41.420\n Google Fiber and cable installation, all that stuff.\n\n1:59:41.420 --> 1:59:45.480\n I've been always a believer, washing dishes.\n\n1:59:45.480 --> 1:59:47.840\n People don't often believe me when I say this.\n\n1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:49.560\n I don't care what I do.\n\n1:59:50.800 --> 1:59:52.560\n I am with David Foster Wallace.\n\n1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:53.920\n I'm unborable.\n\n1:59:53.920 --> 1:59:55.840\n There's so much joy for me.\n\n1:59:55.840 --> 1:59:58.560\n I think for everyone, but okay, let me just speak for me,\n\n1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:02.740\n to be discovered in getting really good at anything.\n\n2:00:02.740 --> 2:00:04.280\n In fact, getting good at stuff\n\n2:00:04.280 --> 2:00:09.280\n that most people believe is boring or menial labor\n\n2:00:09.320 --> 2:00:14.120\n or impossible to be interesting,\n\n2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:17.040\n that's even more joyful to find the joy within that\n\n2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:17.880\n and the excellence.\n\n2:00:17.880 --> 2:00:19.400\n It's the Jiro dreams of sushi,\n\n2:00:19.400 --> 2:00:22.560\n making the same fricking sushi over and over\n\n2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:25.720\n and becoming a master that can be truly joyful.\n\n2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:29.360\n There's a sense of pride and on the pragmatic level,\n\n2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:31.640\n you never know when someone will spot that.\n\n2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:34.480\n And intelligent people who perform\n\n2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.840\n at the level of high excellence look for others.\n\n2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:37.680\n Who do you say?\n\n2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:39.320\n And it radiates some kind of signal.\n\n2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:40.160\n It's weird.\n\n2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:43.660\n It's weird what you attract to yourself\n\n2:00:43.660 --> 2:00:45.760\n when you just focus on mastery\n\n2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:48.440\n and pursuing excellence in something.\n\n2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:51.840\n Like this is the cool thing about it.\n\n2:00:51.840 --> 2:00:53.960\n That's the joy I've really truly experienced.\n\n2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:55.060\n I didn't have to do much work.\n\n2:00:55.060 --> 2:00:56.760\n It's just cool people kind of,\n\n2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:58.840\n I find myself in groups of cool people,\n\n2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:01.120\n like really people who are excited about life,\n\n2:01:01.120 --> 2:01:02.600\n who are passionate about life.\n\n2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:04.060\n There's a fire in their eyes.\n\n2:01:04.060 --> 2:01:07.860\n That's at the end of the day just makes life fun.\n\n2:01:09.000 --> 2:01:11.020\n And then also money wise,\n\n2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:12.420\n at least in this society,\n\n2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:15.080\n we're fortunate to where if you do that kind of thing,\n\n2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:16.440\n money will find a way.\n\n2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:17.780\n Like I have the great,\n\n2:01:17.780 --> 2:01:20.000\n I say this that I don't care about money.\n\n2:01:21.820 --> 2:01:23.580\n I have to think about what that means\n\n2:01:23.580 --> 2:01:25.200\n because some people criticize that idea.\n\n2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:27.560\n It's like, yeah, it must be nice to say that.\n\n2:01:28.560 --> 2:01:30.040\n Cause I have for much,\n\n2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:32.240\n many periods of my life had very little money,\n\n2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.560\n but I think we live in a society\n\n2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.400\n where not caring about money,\n\n2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:38.960\n but just focusing on your passions.\n\n2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:41.560\n If you're truly pursuing excellence, whatever that is,\n\n2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:42.480\n money will find you.\n\n2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:44.720\n That's I guess the ideal of the capitalist system.\n\n2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:46.760\n And I think that the entrepreneurs I've studied\n\n2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:48.240\n and had the chance to get to know,\n\n2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:49.360\n and I'm sure you'd agree with this,\n\n2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:50.960\n they do what they do\n\n2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:53.320\n cause they're passionate about the product.\n\n2:01:53.320 --> 2:01:55.600\n They're not just in it to make money.\n\n2:01:55.600 --> 2:01:57.240\n In fact, that's when they get into trouble\n\n2:01:57.240 --> 2:01:58.440\n when they're just trying to make money.\n\n2:01:58.440 --> 2:01:59.280\n Exactly.\n\n2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:02.480\n You said your grandmother, Emily,\n\n2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:04.280\n had a big impact on your life.\n\n2:02:04.280 --> 2:02:07.340\n She lived to 102.\n\n2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:10.160\n What are some lessons she taught you?\n\n2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:13.820\n Emily, who was the child of immigrants\n\n2:02:13.820 --> 2:02:15.960\n from Russia and Poland,\n\n2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:17.360\n who never went to college,\n\n2:02:18.320 --> 2:02:21.520\n her proudest day I think was when I went to college.\n\n2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:26.520\n She treated everyone with respect\n\n2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:28.660\n and tried to get to know everyone.\n\n2:02:28.660 --> 2:02:31.020\n She knew every bus driver in the town.\n\n2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:33.420\n She'd remember their birthdays.\n\n2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:35.340\n And one of the things she taught me is\n\n2:02:35.340 --> 2:02:37.940\n no matter how high you fly,\n\n2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:40.740\n the lowest person close to the ground matters to you.\n\n2:02:41.700 --> 2:02:43.860\n And you treat them the same way\n\n2:02:43.860 --> 2:02:47.180\n you treat the billionaire at the top of the podium.\n\n2:02:47.180 --> 2:02:48.080\n And she did that.\n\n2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:49.600\n She didn't just say that.\n\n2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:50.820\n Some people say that and don't do it.\n\n2:02:50.820 --> 2:02:52.100\n She really did that.\n\n2:02:52.100 --> 2:02:56.780\n And I always remember that it comes up in my mind\n\n2:02:56.780 --> 2:02:57.660\n at least once a week\n\n2:02:57.660 --> 2:03:00.420\n because we're all busy doing a lot of things\n\n2:03:01.300 --> 2:03:04.100\n and you either see or you even feel in yourself\n\n2:03:04.100 --> 2:03:07.220\n the desire to just, for the reasons of speed,\n\n2:03:07.220 --> 2:03:09.980\n to be short or not polite with someone\n\n2:03:09.980 --> 2:03:12.320\n who can't do anything to harm you right now.\n\n2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:15.500\n And I remember her saying to me,\n\n2:03:15.500 --> 2:03:18.620\n no, you don't, you treat everyone with respect.\n\n2:03:18.620 --> 2:03:21.060\n You treat the person you're on the phone with,\n\n2:03:21.060 --> 2:03:22.500\n customer service.\n\n2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:24.500\n You treat that person if you're talking to Jeff Bezos\n\n2:03:24.500 --> 2:03:26.300\n or you're talking to Elon Musk.\n\n2:03:27.260 --> 2:03:29.780\n And I think making that a culture\n\n2:03:29.780 --> 2:03:31.500\n of who you are is so important.\n\n2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:32.460\n And people notice that.\n\n2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:33.520\n That's the other thing.\n\n2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:34.780\n And they notice when it's authentic.\n\n2:03:34.780 --> 2:03:36.420\n Everyone's nice to the person at the bottom\n\n2:03:36.420 --> 2:03:38.740\n of the totem pole when you want to get ahead in the line\n\n2:03:38.740 --> 2:03:40.380\n for your driver's license.\n\n2:03:40.380 --> 2:03:42.460\n But are you nice to them when you don't need that?\n\n2:03:42.460 --> 2:03:43.300\n They notice that.\n\n2:03:43.300 --> 2:03:45.180\n And even when nobody's watching,\n\n2:03:45.180 --> 2:03:47.100\n that has a weird effect on you\n\n2:03:47.100 --> 2:03:51.240\n that's going to have a ripple effect and people know.\n\n2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:52.660\n That's the cool thing about the internet.\n\n2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.280\n I've come to believe that people see authenticity.\n\n2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.500\n They see when you're full of shit, when you're not.\n\n2:03:57.500 --> 2:03:58.340\n That's right.\n\n2:03:58.340 --> 2:03:59.900\n The other thing that Emily taught me,\n\n2:03:59.900 --> 2:04:02.140\n and I think we've all had relatives who have taught us this,\n\n2:04:02.140 --> 2:04:04.020\n that you could be very uneducated.\n\n2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:05.140\n She was very uneducated.\n\n2:04:05.140 --> 2:04:06.940\n She had a high school diploma,\n\n2:04:06.940 --> 2:04:11.060\n but I think she was working in a delicatessen in New York\n\n2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:12.080\n while she was in high school,\n\n2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:13.460\n or maybe it was at Gimbels or somebody.\n\n2:04:13.460 --> 2:04:14.860\n So she probably didn't take high school very seriously.\n\n2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:16.020\n She wasn't very well educated.\n\n2:04:16.020 --> 2:04:17.420\n She was very smart.\n\n2:04:17.420 --> 2:04:19.740\n And we can fall into a world\n\n2:04:19.740 --> 2:04:21.960\n where I'm a big believer in higher education\n\n2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:24.380\n and getting a PhD and things of that sort,\n\n2:04:24.380 --> 2:04:26.540\n but where we think those are the only smart people.\n\n2:04:26.540 --> 2:04:27.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:31.020\n Sometimes those are the people,\n\n2:04:31.020 --> 2:04:32.380\n because of their accomplishments,\n\n2:04:32.380 --> 2:04:33.740\n because their egos are the ones\n\n2:04:33.740 --> 2:04:38.740\n who are least educated in the way of the world.\n\n2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:39.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:39.940 --> 2:04:44.860\n Least curious, and ultimately wisdom comes from curiosity.\n\n2:04:44.860 --> 2:04:49.660\n And sometimes getting a PhD can get in the way of curiosity\n\n2:04:49.660 --> 2:04:51.260\n as opposed to empower curiosity.\n\n2:04:54.180 --> 2:04:58.300\n Let me ask, from a historical perspective,\n\n2:04:58.300 --> 2:05:00.940\n you've studied some of human history.\n\n2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.800\n So maybe you have an insight\n\n2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:04.400\n about what's the meaning of life.\n\n2:05:07.860 --> 2:05:10.260\n Do you ever ask when you look at history, the why?\n\n2:05:10.260 --> 2:05:13.740\n Yeah, I do all the time, and I don't have an answer.\n\n2:05:13.740 --> 2:05:16.260\n It's the mystery that we can't answer.\n\n2:05:16.260 --> 2:05:20.340\n I do think what it means is what we make of it.\n\n2:05:21.940 --> 2:05:24.980\n There's no universal, every period I've studied,\n\n2:05:24.980 --> 2:05:26.420\n and I've studied a little bit of a lot of periods\n\n2:05:26.420 --> 2:05:28.000\n and a lot of a few periods,\n\n2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:29.420\n every period people struggle with this,\n\n2:05:29.420 --> 2:05:31.140\n and they don't come to,\n\n2:05:31.140 --> 2:05:34.500\n wiser people than us don't come to a firm answer,\n\n2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:37.060\n except it's what you make of it.\n\n2:05:37.060 --> 2:05:38.380\n Meaning is what you make of it.\n\n2:05:38.380 --> 2:05:42.240\n So think about what you want to care about\n\n2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:44.940\n and make that the meaning in your life.\n\n2:05:44.940 --> 2:05:48.140\n I wonder how that changes throughout human history,\n\n2:05:48.140 --> 2:05:50.260\n whether there's a constant.\n\n2:05:50.260 --> 2:05:52.560\n Like I often think,\n\n2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:55.340\n especially when you study evolutionary biology\n\n2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:59.220\n and you just see our origins from life and as it evolves,\n\n2:05:59.220 --> 2:06:01.100\n it's like, it makes you wonder,\n\n2:06:02.260 --> 2:06:05.640\n it feels like there's a thread that connects all of it,\n\n2:06:06.820 --> 2:06:11.060\n that we're headed somewhere.\n\n2:06:11.060 --> 2:06:16.060\n We're trying to actualize some greater purpose.\n\n2:06:17.420 --> 2:06:20.180\n Like there seems to be a direction to this thing,\n\n2:06:20.180 --> 2:06:22.140\n and we're all kind of stumbling in the dark\n\n2:06:22.140 --> 2:06:24.060\n trying to figure it out,\n\n2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:27.380\n but it feels like we eventually will find an answer.\n\n2:06:28.400 --> 2:06:30.000\n I hope so, yeah, maybe.\n\n2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:35.000\n I mean, I do think we all want our families to do better.\n\n2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:39.560\n We are familiar,\n\n2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:41.320\n and family doesn't just mean biological family.\n\n2:06:41.320 --> 2:06:42.680\n You can have all kinds of ways\n\n2:06:42.680 --> 2:06:44.220\n you define family and community,\n\n2:06:44.220 --> 2:06:47.760\n and I think we are moving slowly\n\n2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:52.200\n and in a very messy way toward a larger world community.\n\n2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.900\n To include all of biological life\n\n2:06:54.900 --> 2:06:58.680\n and eventually artificial life as well.\n\n2:06:58.680 --> 2:07:03.680\n Yeah, so to expand the lesson to the advice\n\n2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:08.040\n that your grandmother taught you,\n\n2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:11.200\n is I think we should treat robots and AI systems\n\n2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:15.480\n good as well, even if they're currently not very intelligent\n\n2:07:15.480 --> 2:07:16.960\n because one day they might be.\n\n2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:18.580\n Right, right, I think that's exactly right,\n\n2:07:18.580 --> 2:07:20.220\n and we should think through,\n\n2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:24.520\n exactly as a humanist how I would approach that issue.\n\n2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:27.760\n We need to think through the kinds of behavior patterns\n\n2:07:27.760 --> 2:07:31.280\n we want to establish with these new forms of life,\n\n2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:35.800\n artificial life for ourselves also, to your point,\n\n2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:38.400\n so we behave the right way, so we don't misuse this.\n\n2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:42.280\n We started talking about Abraham Lincoln,\n\n2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:44.600\n ended talking about robots.\n\n2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:47.040\n I think this is the perfect conversation, Jeremy.\n\n2:07:47.040 --> 2:07:48.960\n This was a huge honor.\n\n2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:52.360\n I love Austin, I love UT Austin,\n\n2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:54.400\n and I love the fact that you would agree\n\n2:07:54.400 --> 2:07:56.600\n to waste all your valuable time with me today.\n\n2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:57.880\n Thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n2:07:57.880 --> 2:08:00.440\n I can't imagine a better way to spend a Friday afternoon.\n\n2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:03.120\n This was so much fun, and I'm such a fan of your podcast\n\n2:08:03.120 --> 2:08:04.800\n and delighted to be a part of it.\n\n2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:06.440\n Thank you.\n\n2:08:06.440 --> 2:08:07.920\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:08:07.920 --> 2:08:11.920\n with Jeremy Suri, and thank you to Element, Monkpac,\n\n2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:15.840\n Belcampo, Four Sigmatic, and Asleep.\n\n2:08:15.840 --> 2:08:19.260\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:21.440\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:24.960\n from Franklin D. Roosevelt, FDR.\n\n2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:27.320\n Democracy cannot succeed unless those\n\n2:08:27.320 --> 2:08:31.560\n who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely.\n\n2:08:31.560 --> 2:08:35.960\n The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.\n\n2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:55.320\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
