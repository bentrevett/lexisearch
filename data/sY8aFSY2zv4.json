abyss gazes also into you.\n\n00:08.960 --> 00:12.200\n But I would say, bring it on.\n\n00:13.060 --> 00:15.280\n If you gaze into the abyss long enough,\n\n00:15.280 --> 00:17.240\n you see the light, not the darkness.\n\n00:18.320 --> 00:20.220\n Are you sure about that?\n\n00:20.220 --> 00:21.680\n I'm betting my life on it.\n\n00:24.320 --> 00:27.240\n The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson,\n\n00:27.240 --> 00:30.840\n an influential psychologist, lecturer, podcast host,\n\n00:30.840 --> 00:34.840\n and author of Maps of Meaning, 12 Rules for Life,\n\n00:34.840 --> 00:37.740\n and Beyond Order.\n\n00:37.740 --> 00:39.660\n This is the Lex Readman podcast.\n\n00:39.660 --> 00:41.680\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:41.680 --> 00:43.000\n in the description.\n\n00:43.000 --> 00:46.940\n And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Peterson.\n\n00:48.040 --> 00:50.440\n Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot,\n\n00:50.440 --> 00:52.920\n spoken through the character of Prince Mishkin,\n\n00:52.920 --> 00:55.120\n that beauty will save the world.\n\n00:55.120 --> 00:58.840\n Solzhenitsyn actually mentioned this in his Nobel Prize\n\n00:58.840 --> 01:00.220\n acceptance speech.\n\n01:00.220 --> 01:02.480\n What do you think Dostoevsky meant by that?\n\n01:02.480 --> 01:04.120\n Was he right?\n\n01:04.120 --> 01:09.120\n Well, I guess it's the divine that saves the world,\n\n01:10.080 --> 01:13.160\n let's say, you could say that by definition.\n\n01:13.160 --> 01:16.400\n And then you might say, well, are there pointers\n\n01:16.400 --> 01:18.300\n to that which will save the world,\n\n01:18.300 --> 01:20.140\n or that which eternally saves the world?\n\n01:20.140 --> 01:23.360\n And the answer to that, in all likelihood, is yes.\n\n01:23.360 --> 01:27.600\n And that's maybe truth, and love, and justice,\n\n01:27.600 --> 01:31.920\n and the classical virtues, beauty, perhaps,\n\n01:31.920 --> 01:34.640\n in some sense, foremost among them.\n\n01:34.640 --> 01:37.620\n That's a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.\n\n01:37.620 --> 01:39.480\n Which direction is the arrow pointing?\n\n01:39.480 --> 01:40.640\n Well, the arrow's pointing up.\n\n01:40.640 --> 01:43.240\n No, I think that that which it points to\n\n01:43.240 --> 01:45.000\n is what beauty points to.\n\n01:45.000 --> 01:46.360\n It transcends beauty.\n\n01:46.360 --> 01:47.480\n It's more than beauty.\n\n01:47.480 --> 01:49.400\n And that speaks to the divine.\n\n01:49.400 --> 01:51.240\n It points to the divine.\n\n01:51.240 --> 01:53.240\n Yeah, and I would say, again, by definition,\n\n01:53.240 --> 01:56.480\n because we could define the divine in some real sense.\n\n01:56.480 --> 01:59.360\n So one way of defining the divine is,\n\n01:59.360 --> 02:03.480\n what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:06.040\n And you might say, well, I don't have a fundamental axiom.\n\n02:06.040 --> 02:07.280\n And I would say, that's fine,\n\n02:07.280 --> 02:09.620\n but then you're just confused,\n\n02:09.620 --> 02:11.960\n because you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.\n\n02:11.960 --> 02:14.040\n And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.\n\n02:14.040 --> 02:16.240\n And then I'd say, well, you're just epistemologically\n\n02:16.240 --> 02:19.020\n ignorant beyond comprehension, if you think that,\n\n02:19.020 --> 02:20.640\n because that's just not true at all.\n\n02:20.640 --> 02:22.400\n So you don't think a human being can exist\n\n02:22.400 --> 02:24.160\n within contradictions?\n\n02:24.160 --> 02:26.280\n Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction.\n\n02:26.280 --> 02:29.840\n But when the contradictions make themselves manifest,\n\n02:29.840 --> 02:33.020\n say in confusion with regard to direction,\n\n02:33.020 --> 02:37.760\n then the consequence of that technically is anxiety,\n\n02:37.760 --> 02:39.340\n and frustration, and disappointment,\n\n02:39.340 --> 02:41.040\n and all sorts of other negative emotions.\n\n02:41.040 --> 02:43.920\n But the cardinal negative emotion,\n\n02:43.920 --> 02:48.840\n signifying multiple pathways forward, is anxiety.\n\n02:48.840 --> 02:51.080\n It's an entropy signal.\n\n02:51.080 --> 02:53.920\n But you don't think that kind of entropy signal\n\n02:53.920 --> 02:58.520\n can be channeled into beauty, into love?\n\n02:58.520 --> 03:03.520\n Why does beauty and love have to be clear, ordered, simple?\n\n03:04.480 --> 03:08.720\n Well, I would say it probably doesn't have to be,\n\n03:09.560 --> 03:12.540\n it can't be reduced to clarity and simplicity.\n\n03:13.640 --> 03:15.880\n Because when it's optimally structured,\n\n03:15.880 --> 03:20.880\n it's a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.\n\n03:20.880 --> 03:23.280\n If it's too ordered, if music is too ordered,\n\n03:23.280 --> 03:25.180\n it's not acceptable.\n\n03:25.180 --> 03:27.740\n It sounds like a drum machine, it's too repetitive,\n\n03:27.740 --> 03:29.540\n it's too predictable.\n\n03:29.540 --> 03:34.360\n It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it,\n\n03:34.360 --> 03:36.020\n along with the structure.\n\n03:36.020 --> 03:40.740\n I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus\n\n03:40.740 --> 03:45.740\n with a number of scholars, and this is a beauty discussion.\n\n03:45.880 --> 03:48.380\n When Moses first encounters the burning bush,\n\n03:48.380 --> 03:52.420\n it's not a conflagration that demands attention,\n\n03:52.420 --> 03:54.460\n it's something that catches his attention.\n\n03:55.580 --> 03:57.980\n It's a phenomena, and that means to shine forth.\n\n03:57.980 --> 04:01.260\n And Moses has to stop and attend to it, and he does.\n\n04:01.260 --> 04:05.540\n And he sees this fire that doesn't consume the tree.\n\n04:05.540 --> 04:07.740\n And the tree, the tree is a structure, right?\n\n04:07.740 --> 04:10.100\n It's a tree like structure, it's a branching structure,\n\n04:10.100 --> 04:12.040\n it's a hierarchical structure.\n\n04:12.040 --> 04:15.980\n It's a self similar structure, it's a fractal structure.\n\n04:15.980 --> 04:17.140\n And it's the tree of life,\n\n04:17.140 --> 04:19.020\n and it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n\n04:19.020 --> 04:23.060\n And the fire in it is the transformation\n\n04:23.060 --> 04:25.380\n that's always occurring within every structure.\n\n04:25.380 --> 04:28.560\n And the fact that the fire doesn't consume the bush\n\n04:28.560 --> 04:32.380\n in that representation is an indication\n\n04:32.380 --> 04:34.820\n of the balance of transformation with structure.\n\n04:34.820 --> 04:37.940\n And that balance is presented as God,\n\n04:37.940 --> 04:42.320\n and what attracts Moses to it in some sense is the beauty.\n\n04:42.320 --> 04:43.820\n Now it's the novelty and all that,\n\n04:43.820 --> 04:46.480\n but like a painting is like a burning bush,\n\n04:46.480 --> 04:48.780\n that's a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.\n\n04:48.780 --> 04:51.280\n It's too much for people often.\n\n04:51.280 --> 04:55.080\n My house was, and will soon be again,\n\n04:55.080 --> 04:58.180\n completely covered with paintings inside.\n\n04:58.180 --> 05:01.780\n And it was hard on people to come in there\n\n05:01.780 --> 05:04.580\n because, well, my mother, for example, say,\n\n05:04.580 --> 05:07.060\n well, why would you wanna live in a museum?\n\n05:07.060 --> 05:09.180\n And I'd think, well, I would rather live in a museum\n\n05:09.180 --> 05:10.860\n than anywhere else in some real sense,\n\n05:10.860 --> 05:15.060\n but beauty is daunting, it scares people.\n\n05:15.060 --> 05:17.180\n They're terrified of buying art, for example,\n\n05:17.180 --> 05:18.700\n because their taste is on display,\n\n05:18.700 --> 05:19.740\n and they should be terrified\n\n05:19.740 --> 05:22.300\n because generally people have terrible taste.\n\n05:22.300 --> 05:24.500\n Now, that doesn't mean they shouldn't foster it\n\n05:24.500 --> 05:26.380\n and develop it, but, and you know,\n\n05:26.380 --> 05:28.400\n when you put your taste on display,\n\n05:28.400 --> 05:30.700\n it really exposes you.\n\n05:30.700 --> 05:34.580\n Even to yourself as you walk past it every day.\n\n05:34.580 --> 05:36.020\n Absolutely. This is who I am.\n\n05:36.020 --> 05:38.340\n Yeah, well, and look how mundane that is,\n\n05:38.340 --> 05:41.340\n and look how trite it is, and look at how cliched it is,\n\n05:41.340 --> 05:45.100\n and look at how sterile or too ordered it is, or too chaotic.\n\n05:45.100 --> 05:47.140\n Or how quickly you start to take it for granted\n\n05:47.140 --> 05:48.580\n because you've seen it so many times.\n\n05:48.580 --> 05:51.540\n Well, if it's a real piece of art, that doesn't happen.\n\n05:51.540 --> 05:53.340\n You notice the little details.\n\n05:53.340 --> 05:55.700\n The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n05:55.700 --> 05:59.620\n I mean, there are images, religious images in particular,\n\n05:59.620 --> 06:02.080\n so we could call them deep images,\n\n06:02.080 --> 06:07.020\n that people have been unpacking for 4,000 years\n\n06:07.020 --> 06:09.180\n and still haven't, I'll give you an example.\n\n06:09.180 --> 06:12.540\n This is a terrible example.\n\n06:12.540 --> 06:15.820\n So, I did a lecture series on Genesis,\n\n06:15.820 --> 06:21.380\n and I got a lot of it unpacked, but by no means all of it.\n\n06:21.380 --> 06:25.140\n When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden,\n\n06:25.140 --> 06:28.380\n he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate\n\n06:28.380 --> 06:31.860\n to stop human beings from reentering paradise.\n\n06:31.860 --> 06:34.100\n I thought, what the hell does that mean, cherubim,\n\n06:34.100 --> 06:35.740\n and why do they have flaming swords?\n\n06:35.740 --> 06:38.740\n I don't get that. What is that exactly?\n\n06:38.740 --> 06:41.260\n And then I found out from Matthew Pagel,\n\n06:41.260 --> 06:44.180\n who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis,\n\n06:44.180 --> 06:48.060\n that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.\n\n06:48.060 --> 06:50.100\n It's a very complicated idea,\n\n06:50.100 --> 06:53.660\n and that they are partly a representation of that\n\n06:53.660 --> 06:57.100\n which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.\n\n06:57.100 --> 07:00.940\n They've also got an angelic or demonic aspect.\n\n07:00.940 --> 07:02.260\n Take your pick.\n\n07:02.260 --> 07:04.260\n Why do they have flaming swords?\n\n07:04.260 --> 07:11.900\n Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment and the separation\n\n07:11.900 --> 07:13.260\n of the wheat from the chaff.\n\n07:13.260 --> 07:18.500\n You use a sword to cut away, to cut away, and to carve.\n\n07:18.500 --> 07:21.100\n And a flaming sword is not only that which carves,\n\n07:21.100 --> 07:23.300\n it's that which burns.\n\n07:23.300 --> 07:25.700\n And what does it carve away and burn?\n\n07:25.700 --> 07:28.380\n Well, you want to get into paradise?\n\n07:28.380 --> 07:32.500\n It carves away everything about you that isn't perfect.\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:34.020\n And so what does that mean?\n\n07:34.020 --> 07:35.660\n Okay, well, here's part of what it means.\n\n07:35.660 --> 07:37.700\n This is a terrible thing.\n\n07:37.700 --> 07:41.020\n So you could say that the entire Christian narrative\n\n07:41.020 --> 07:43.820\n is embedded in that image.\n\n07:43.820 --> 07:45.020\n Why?\n\n07:45.020 --> 07:48.580\n Well, let's say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.\n\n07:48.580 --> 07:50.780\n That seems pretty obvious.\n\n07:50.780 --> 07:56.900\n Let's say further that they're a symbol of apocalypse and hell.\n\n07:56.900 --> 07:59.540\n That doesn't seem completely unreasonable.\n\n07:59.540 --> 08:02.260\n So here's an idea.\n\n08:02.260 --> 08:04.820\n Not only do you have to face death,\n\n08:04.820 --> 08:09.180\n you have to face death and hell before you can get to paradise.\n\n08:09.180 --> 08:13.540\n Hellish judgment and all that's embedded in that image.\n\n08:13.540 --> 08:16.580\n And a piece of art with an image like that\n\n08:16.580 --> 08:18.820\n has all that information in it.\n\n08:18.820 --> 08:22.660\n And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.\n\n08:22.660 --> 08:25.620\n It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind\n\n08:25.620 --> 08:29.540\n at levels you can't even comprehend and grips you.\n\n08:29.540 --> 08:32.900\n I mean, that's why people go to museums and gaze at paintings\n\n08:32.900 --> 08:33.860\n they don't understand.\n\n08:33.860 --> 08:36.820\n And that's why they'll pay what's the most expensive objects\n\n08:36.820 --> 08:37.700\n in the world.\n\n08:37.700 --> 08:39.740\n If it's not carbon fiber racing yachts,\n\n08:39.740 --> 08:42.900\n it's definitely classic paintings.\n\n08:42.900 --> 08:47.100\n It's high level technological implements or it's classic art.\n\n08:47.100 --> 08:48.940\n Well, why are those things so expensive?\n\n08:48.940 --> 08:51.900\n Why do we build temples to house the images?\n\n08:51.900 --> 08:54.660\n Even secular people go to museums.\n\n08:54.660 --> 08:55.820\n I'm secular.\n\n08:55.820 --> 08:56.980\n Well, are you in a museum?\n\n08:56.980 --> 08:57.620\n Yes.\n\n08:57.620 --> 08:58.620\n Are you looking at art?\n\n08:58.620 --> 08:59.460\n Yes.\n\n08:59.460 --> 09:03.780\n Well, what makes you think you're secular then?\n\n09:03.780 --> 09:07.460\n It's arguable that the thing many, many centuries from now\n\n09:07.460 --> 09:11.660\n that will remain of all of human civilization will be our art.\n\n09:11.660 --> 09:12.940\n Not even the words.\n\n09:12.940 --> 09:16.620\n Well, a book has remained a very long time, right?\n\n09:16.620 --> 09:17.660\n The biblical writings have.\n\n09:17.660 --> 09:18.620\n Not that long.\n\n09:18.620 --> 09:19.740\n A few millennia.\n\n09:19.740 --> 09:21.100\n That's right.\n\n09:21.100 --> 09:24.340\n But that's in the full arc of living organisms,\n\n09:24.340 --> 09:25.180\n perhaps will not be.\n\n09:25.180 --> 09:27.500\n Well, we have images that are, we\n\n09:27.500 --> 09:30.660\n have artistic images that are at least 50,000 years old,\n\n09:30.660 --> 09:32.340\n right, that have survived.\n\n09:32.340 --> 09:35.220\n And some of those are, they're already\n\n09:35.220 --> 09:36.740\n profound in their symbolism.\n\n09:36.740 --> 09:38.220\n By we, do you mean humans?\n\n09:38.220 --> 09:39.380\n Yeah, we found them.\n\n09:39.380 --> 09:44.540\n And they've lasted, they've lasted that long.\n\n09:44.540 --> 09:48.100\n And so, and then think about Europe.\n\n09:48.100 --> 09:49.780\n Secular people all over the world\n\n09:49.780 --> 09:51.860\n make pilgrimages to Europe.\n\n09:51.860 --> 09:53.340\n Well, why?\n\n09:53.340 --> 09:55.100\n Because of the beauty.\n\n09:55.100 --> 09:58.620\n Obviously, I mean, that's self evident.\n\n09:58.620 --> 10:00.780\n And it's partly because there are things\n\n10:00.780 --> 10:02.020\n in Europe that are so beautiful.\n\n10:02.020 --> 10:03.300\n They take your breath away, right?\n\n10:03.300 --> 10:04.580\n They make your hair stand on end.\n\n10:04.580 --> 10:07.540\n They fill you with a sense of awe.\n\n10:07.540 --> 10:10.460\n And we need to see those things.\n\n10:10.460 --> 10:11.380\n It's not optional.\n\n10:11.380 --> 10:13.020\n We need to see those things.\n\n10:13.020 --> 10:13.940\n The cathedrals.\n\n10:13.940 --> 10:17.700\n I was in a cathedral in Vienna, and it was terribly beautiful.\n\n10:17.700 --> 10:18.500\n Terribly beautiful.\n\n10:18.500 --> 10:20.060\n Well, it was terribly beautiful.\n\n10:20.060 --> 10:21.780\n Is beauty painful for you?\n\n10:21.780 --> 10:24.300\n Is that the highest form of beauty?\n\n10:24.300 --> 10:25.660\n It really challenges you?\n\n10:25.660 --> 10:27.020\n Oh, definitely.\n\n10:27.020 --> 10:27.620\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n10:27.620 --> 10:29.940\n I got a good analysis of the statue of David.\n\n10:29.940 --> 10:33.980\n Michelangelo says, you could be far more than you are.\n\n10:33.980 --> 10:35.940\n That's what that statue says.\n\n10:35.940 --> 10:41.140\n And this cathedral, we went down into the under structure of it.\n\n10:41.140 --> 10:46.220\n And there were three floors of bones from the plague.\n\n10:46.220 --> 10:47.540\n And there they all are.\n\n10:47.540 --> 10:50.100\n And then that cathedral is on top of it.\n\n10:50.100 --> 10:53.380\n It's no joke to go visit a place like that.\n\n10:53.380 --> 10:56.340\n No, it rattles you to the core.\n\n10:56.340 --> 11:03.340\n And our religious systems have become propositionally dubious.\n\n11:03.340 --> 11:05.340\n But there's no arguing with the architecture,\n\n11:05.340 --> 11:07.420\n although modern architects like to,\n\n11:07.420 --> 11:10.660\n with their sterility and their giant middle fingers erected\n\n11:10.660 --> 11:12.300\n everywhere.\n\n11:12.300 --> 11:16.620\n But beauty is a terrible pointer to God.\n\n11:16.620 --> 11:19.460\n And a secular person will say, well, I don't believe in God.\n\n11:19.460 --> 11:22.580\n It's like, have it your way.\n\n11:22.580 --> 11:23.700\n You got it.\n\n11:23.700 --> 11:26.780\n You cannot move forward into the unforeseen horizon\n\n11:26.780 --> 11:29.660\n of the future except on faith.\n\n11:29.660 --> 11:31.360\n And you might say, well, I have no faith.\n\n11:31.360 --> 11:33.360\n It's like, well, good luck with the future then.\n\n11:33.360 --> 11:36.220\n Because what are you then, nihilistic and hopeless\n\n11:36.220 --> 11:38.260\n and anxiety ridden?\n\n11:38.260 --> 11:40.980\n And if not, well, something's guiding you forward.\n\n11:40.980 --> 11:43.580\n It's faith in something or multiple things,\n\n11:43.580 --> 11:45.940\n which just makes you a polytheist,\n\n11:45.940 --> 11:48.100\n which I wouldn't recommend.\n\n11:48.100 --> 11:52.780\n Well, let me ask you one short lived biological meat\n\n11:52.780 --> 11:54.780\n bag to another.\n\n11:54.780 --> 11:58.100\n Who is God then?\n\n11:58.100 --> 12:00.300\n Let's try to sneak up to this question\n\n12:00.300 --> 12:01.620\n if it's at all possible.\n\n12:01.620 --> 12:04.980\n Is it possible to even talk about this?\n\n12:04.980 --> 12:05.740\n Well, it better be.\n\n12:05.740 --> 12:08.900\n Because otherwise, there's no communicating about it.\n\n12:08.900 --> 12:12.300\n It has to be something that can be brought down to Earth.\n\n12:12.300 --> 12:14.700\n Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.\n\n12:14.700 --> 12:16.020\n It's not just ignorant.\n\n12:16.020 --> 12:20.540\n It's also sinful because there's not knowing.\n\n12:20.540 --> 12:24.580\n And then there's wanting to know or refusing to know.\n\n12:24.580 --> 12:26.980\n And so you might say, well, could you\n\n12:26.980 --> 12:30.900\n extract God from a description of the objective world?\n\n12:30.900 --> 12:36.940\n Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?\n\n12:36.940 --> 12:39.300\n And I would say, well, in a sense,\n\n12:39.300 --> 12:41.720\n there's some truth in that, but not exactly.\n\n12:41.720 --> 12:45.060\n Because God in the highest sense is the spirit\n\n12:45.060 --> 12:49.060\n that you must emulate in order to thrive.\n\n12:49.060 --> 12:51.460\n How's that for a biological definition?\n\n12:51.460 --> 12:54.540\n Spirit is a pattern, the spirit that you must\n\n12:54.540 --> 12:56.140\n emulate in order to thrive.\n\n12:56.140 --> 13:01.500\n So it's a kind of, in one sense, when we say the human spirit,\n\n13:01.500 --> 13:02.620\n it's that.\n\n13:02.620 --> 13:04.380\n It's an animating principle.\n\n13:04.380 --> 13:05.520\n Yeah, it's a meta.\n\n13:05.520 --> 13:06.980\n It's a pattern.\n\n13:06.980 --> 13:08.940\n And you might say, well, what's the pattern?\n\n13:08.940 --> 13:11.340\n Well, I can tell you that to some degree.\n\n13:11.340 --> 13:14.860\n Imagine that like your grip by beauty,\n\n13:14.860 --> 13:17.420\n you're gripped by admiration.\n\n13:17.420 --> 13:19.100\n And you can just notice this.\n\n13:19.100 --> 13:20.300\n This isn't propositional.\n\n13:20.300 --> 13:21.580\n You have to notice it.\n\n13:21.580 --> 13:26.940\n It's like, oh, turns out I admire that person.\n\n13:26.940 --> 13:28.260\n So what does that mean?\n\n13:28.260 --> 13:31.740\n Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.\n\n13:31.740 --> 13:32.940\n That's what admiration means.\n\n13:32.940 --> 13:35.180\n It means there's something about the way\n\n13:35.180 --> 13:40.100\n they are that compels imitation, another instinct,\n\n13:40.100 --> 13:44.780\n or inspires respect or awe even.\n\n13:44.780 --> 13:46.820\n What is that that grips you?\n\n13:46.820 --> 13:49.340\n Well, I don't know.\n\n13:49.340 --> 13:51.180\n Well, let's say, OK, fine.\n\n13:51.180 --> 13:52.020\n But it grips you.\n\n13:52.020 --> 13:53.380\n And you want to be like that.\n\n13:53.380 --> 13:55.220\n Kids hero worship, for example.\n\n13:55.220 --> 13:56.980\n So do adults, for that matter, unless they\n\n13:56.980 --> 13:58.140\n become entirely cynical.\n\n13:58.140 --> 14:00.380\n I worship quite a few heroes.\n\n14:00.380 --> 14:01.740\n Well, there you go.\n\n14:01.740 --> 14:03.380\n Yes, well, there you go.\n\n14:03.380 --> 14:07.180\n And there's no, that worship, that celebration and proclivity\n\n14:07.180 --> 14:08.460\n to imitate is worship.\n\n14:08.460 --> 14:11.180\n That's what worship means most fundamentally.\n\n14:11.180 --> 14:16.020\n Now, imagine you took the set of all admirable people\n\n14:16.020 --> 14:18.940\n and you extracted out AI learning.\n\n14:18.940 --> 14:20.940\n You extracted out the central features\n\n14:20.940 --> 14:23.260\n of what constitutes admirable.\n\n14:23.260 --> 14:25.860\n And then you did that repeatedly until you purified it\n\n14:25.860 --> 14:29.220\n to what was most admirable.\n\n14:29.220 --> 14:33.180\n That's as good as you're going to get in terms\n\n14:33.180 --> 14:35.660\n of a representation of God.\n\n14:35.660 --> 14:37.620\n And you might say, well, I don't believe in that.\n\n14:37.620 --> 14:40.780\n It's like, well, what do you mean?\n\n14:40.780 --> 14:43.780\n It's not a set of propositional facts.\n\n14:43.780 --> 14:46.260\n It's not a scientific theory about the structure\n\n14:46.260 --> 14:47.380\n of the objective world.\n\n14:47.380 --> 14:49.060\n And then I could say something about that, too,\n\n14:49.060 --> 14:50.900\n because I've been thinking about this a lot,\n\n14:50.900 --> 14:53.300\n especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.\n\n14:53.300 --> 14:57.260\n It's like, OK, the postmodernist types,\n\n14:57.260 --> 14:59.580\n going back way before Derrida and Foucault,\n\n14:59.580 --> 15:04.260\n maybe back to Nietzsche, who I admire greatly, by the way.\n\n15:04.260 --> 15:06.500\n He says, God is dead.\n\n15:06.500 --> 15:07.780\n It's like, OK.\n\n15:07.780 --> 15:10.140\n But Nietzsche said, God is dead, and we have killed him,\n\n15:10.140 --> 15:12.940\n and we'll not find enough water to wash away all the blood.\n\n15:12.940 --> 15:14.180\n So that was Nietzsche.\n\n15:14.180 --> 15:15.060\n He's no fool.\n\n15:15.060 --> 15:16.100\n He's got away with words.\n\n15:16.100 --> 15:17.740\n He certainly does.\n\n15:17.740 --> 15:22.260\n And so then you think, OK, well, we killed the transcendent.\n\n15:22.260 --> 15:24.700\n Well, what does that mean for science?\n\n15:24.700 --> 15:28.260\n Well, it frees it up, because all that nonsense about a deity\n\n15:28.260 --> 15:30.500\n is just the idiot superstition that\n\n15:30.500 --> 15:35.500\n stops the scientific process from moving forward.\n\n15:35.500 --> 15:38.580\n That's basically the new atheist claim, something like that.\n\n15:38.580 --> 15:40.900\n It's like, wait a second.\n\n15:40.900 --> 15:42.300\n Do you believe in the transcendent\n\n15:42.300 --> 15:44.540\n if you're a scientist?\n\n15:44.540 --> 15:47.820\n And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it,\n\n15:47.820 --> 15:49.580\n you believe in it more than anything else.\n\n15:49.580 --> 15:51.900\n Because if you're a scientist, you\n\n15:51.900 --> 15:56.180\n believe in what objects to your theory\n\n15:56.180 --> 15:58.460\n more than you believe in your theory.\n\n15:58.460 --> 16:00.500\n Now, we've got to think that through very carefully.\n\n16:00.500 --> 16:01.940\n So your theory describes the world.\n\n16:01.940 --> 16:05.380\n And as far as you're concerned, your description of the world\n\n16:05.380 --> 16:07.220\n is the world.\n\n16:07.220 --> 16:09.660\n But because you're a scientist, you think, well,\n\n16:09.660 --> 16:11.900\n even though that's my description of the world\n\n16:11.900 --> 16:14.020\n and that's what I believe, there's\n\n16:14.020 --> 16:17.100\n something beyond what I believe.\n\n16:17.100 --> 16:18.060\n And that's the object.\n\n16:18.060 --> 16:20.340\n And so I'm going to throw my theory against the object\n\n16:20.340 --> 16:21.940\n and see where it'll break.\n\n16:21.940 --> 16:25.340\n And then I'm going to use the evidence of the break\n\n16:25.340 --> 16:28.900\n as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.\n\n16:28.900 --> 16:30.620\n So as a scientist, you have to posit\n\n16:30.620 --> 16:33.900\n the existence of the ontological transcendent\n\n16:33.900 --> 16:36.180\n before you can move forward at all.\n\n16:36.180 --> 16:40.580\n But more, you have to posit that contact\n\n16:40.580 --> 16:43.060\n with the ontological transcendent,\n\n16:43.060 --> 16:46.420\n annoying though it is because it upsets your apple cart,\n\n16:46.420 --> 16:49.740\n is exactly what will, in fact, set you free.\n\n16:49.740 --> 16:51.380\n So then you accept the proposition\n\n16:51.380 --> 16:54.500\n that there is a transcendent reality\n\n16:54.500 --> 16:58.500\n and that contact with that transcendent reality\n\n16:58.500 --> 17:00.980\n is redemptive in the most fundamental sense.\n\n17:00.980 --> 17:02.500\n Because if it wasn't, well, why would you\n\n17:02.500 --> 17:03.860\n bother making contact with it?\n\n17:03.860 --> 17:06.300\n Is it going to make everything worse or better?\n\n17:06.300 --> 17:10.100\n Why does the contact with the transcendent\n\n17:10.100 --> 17:11.820\n set you free as a scientist?\n\n17:11.820 --> 17:13.900\n Because you assume that, you assume,\n\n17:13.900 --> 17:15.940\n I mean, freedom in the most fundamental sense.\n\n17:15.940 --> 17:17.940\n It's like, well, freedom from want,\n\n17:17.940 --> 17:21.060\n freedom from disease, freedom from ignorance, right?\n\n17:21.060 --> 17:22.460\n That it informs you.\n\n17:22.460 --> 17:24.900\n So it's the lie of science.\n\n17:24.900 --> 17:27.380\n It is definitely that.\n\n17:27.380 --> 17:30.140\n Yeah, it's the direction, let's say,\n\n17:30.140 --> 17:31.460\n the directionality of science.\n\n17:31.460 --> 17:34.340\n That's a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.\n\n17:34.340 --> 17:36.500\n And then the question is, what is the narrative?\n\n17:36.500 --> 17:38.860\n Well, it posits a transcendent reality.\n\n17:38.860 --> 17:41.700\n It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.\n\n17:41.700 --> 17:43.540\n It posits that our knowledge structures\n\n17:43.540 --> 17:46.060\n should be regarded with humility.\n\n17:46.060 --> 17:48.260\n It posits that you should bow down\n\n17:48.260 --> 17:51.860\n in the face of the transcendent evidence.\n\n17:51.860 --> 17:53.300\n And you have to take a vow.\n\n17:53.300 --> 17:54.540\n You know this as a scientist.\n\n17:54.540 --> 17:56.700\n You have to take a vow to follow that path if you're\n\n17:56.700 --> 17:57.900\n going to be a real scientist.\n\n17:57.900 --> 18:01.740\n Like, the truth, no matter what, and that\n\n18:01.740 --> 18:05.140\n means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.\n\n18:05.140 --> 18:06.380\n Well, what does redemptive mean?\n\n18:06.380 --> 18:07.700\n Well, why bother with science?\n\n18:07.700 --> 18:09.140\n Well, so people don't starve.\n\n18:09.140 --> 18:11.220\n So people can move about more effectively.\n\n18:11.220 --> 18:12.980\n So life can be more abundant, right?\n\n18:12.980 --> 18:16.700\n So it's all ensconced within an underlying ethic.\n\n18:16.700 --> 18:19.740\n So the reason I was saying that while we were talking\n\n18:19.740 --> 18:21.220\n about belief in God, it's like, this\n\n18:21.220 --> 18:23.180\n is a very complicated topic, right?\n\n18:23.180 --> 18:25.020\n Do you believe in a transcendent reality?\n\n18:25.020 --> 18:28.860\n See, OK, now let's say you buy the argument I just\n\n18:28.860 --> 18:30.020\n made on the natural front.\n\n18:30.020 --> 18:33.300\n You say, yeah, yeah, that's just nature.\n\n18:33.300 --> 18:35.660\n That's not God.\n\n18:35.660 --> 18:37.380\n And then I'd say, well, what makes you think\n\n18:37.380 --> 18:39.700\n you know what nature is?\n\n18:39.700 --> 18:41.940\n Like, see, the problem with that argument\n\n18:41.940 --> 18:45.460\n is that it already presumes a materialist,\n\n18:45.460 --> 18:48.180\n a reductionist, materialist, objective view\n\n18:48.180 --> 18:50.140\n of what constitutes nature.\n\n18:50.140 --> 18:52.540\n But if you're a scientist, you're going to think,\n\n18:52.540 --> 18:54.980\n well, in the final analysis, I don't know what nature is.\n\n18:54.980 --> 18:58.140\n I certainly don't know its origin or destination point.\n\n18:58.140 --> 19:00.100\n I don't know its teleology.\n\n19:00.100 --> 19:02.620\n I'm really ignorant about nature.\n\n19:02.620 --> 19:05.420\n And so when I say it's nothing but nature,\n\n19:05.420 --> 19:07.700\n I shouldn't mean it's nothing but what\n\n19:07.700 --> 19:10.460\n I understand nature to be.\n\n19:10.460 --> 19:13.300\n So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account\n\n19:13.300 --> 19:16.060\n of cognitive processes?\n\n19:16.060 --> 19:17.380\n And the answer to that is yes.\n\n19:17.380 --> 19:20.700\n But by the time we do that, our understanding of matter\n\n19:20.700 --> 19:22.700\n will have transformed so much that what\n\n19:22.700 --> 19:25.820\n we think of as reductionists now won't look anything like what\n\n19:25.820 --> 19:27.940\n we think of reductionism now.\n\n19:27.940 --> 19:30.780\n Matter isn't dead dust.\n\n19:30.780 --> 19:32.500\n I don't know what it is.\n\n19:32.500 --> 19:34.020\n I have no idea what it is.\n\n19:34.020 --> 19:35.820\n Matter is what matters.\n\n19:35.820 --> 19:37.180\n There is a definition.\n\n19:37.180 --> 19:39.300\n That's a very weird definition.\n\n19:39.300 --> 19:42.540\n But the notion that we have, you know,\n\n19:42.540 --> 19:44.980\n that if you're a reductionist, a materialist reductionist,\n\n19:44.980 --> 19:47.940\n that you can reduce the complexity of what\n\n19:47.940 --> 19:51.780\n is to your assumptions about the nature of matter,\n\n19:51.780 --> 19:53.260\n that's not a scientific proposition.\n\n19:53.260 --> 19:56.660\n Your specific limited human assumptions of this century,\n\n19:56.660 --> 20:01.700\n of this week, that so in some sense,\n\n20:01.700 --> 20:06.180\n without God in this complicated big definition\n\n20:06.180 --> 20:10.460\n we're talking about, there's no humility.\n\n20:10.460 --> 20:16.500\n Or it's less likely to be, or rather science\n\n20:16.500 --> 20:20.740\n can err in taking a trajectory away from humility.\n\n20:20.740 --> 20:21.340\n Well.\n\n20:21.340 --> 20:23.980\n Without something much more powerful\n\n20:23.980 --> 20:26.100\n than an individual human.\n\n20:26.100 --> 20:27.820\n Yeah, well then and we know, you know,\n\n20:27.820 --> 20:30.420\n the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.\n\n20:30.420 --> 20:33.700\n And that's a good story for the current times.\n\n20:33.700 --> 20:38.820\n It's like you're playing around with making new life.\n\n20:38.820 --> 20:43.340\n You bloody well better make sure you have your arrows pointed up.\n\n20:43.340 --> 20:49.340\n And it's interesting because you said science has an ethic to it.\n\n20:49.340 --> 20:51.300\n I think it's embedded in an ethic.\n\n20:51.300 --> 20:55.740\n Well, there's a, you know, science is a big word.\n\n20:55.740 --> 20:57.220\n And it includes a lot of disciplines\n\n20:57.220 --> 20:58.500\n that have different traditions.\n\n20:58.500 --> 21:04.180\n So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics,\n\n21:04.180 --> 21:06.620\n those are very different communities.\n\n21:06.620 --> 21:09.020\n And I think biology, especially when\n\n21:09.020 --> 21:12.140\n you get closer and closer to medicine and to the human body,\n\n21:12.140 --> 21:14.460\n does have a very serious, first of all,\n\n21:14.460 --> 21:16.740\n has a history with Nazi Germany of being abused\n\n21:16.740 --> 21:18.220\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n21:18.220 --> 21:21.060\n But it has a history of taking this stuff seriously.\n\n21:21.060 --> 21:23.620\n What doesn't have a history of taking this stuff seriously\n\n21:23.620 --> 21:25.700\n is robotics and artificial intelligence,\n\n21:25.700 --> 21:27.300\n which is really interesting.\n\n21:27.300 --> 21:32.260\n Because you don't, you know, you called me a scientist.\n\n21:32.260 --> 21:34.900\n And I would like to wear that label proudly,\n\n21:34.900 --> 21:38.820\n but often people don't think of computer science as a science.\n\n21:38.820 --> 21:41.500\n But nevertheless, it will be, I think,\n\n21:41.500 --> 21:44.820\n the science of one of the major scientific fields\n\n21:44.820 --> 21:46.260\n of the 21st century.\n\n21:46.260 --> 21:48.660\n And you should take that very seriously.\n\n21:48.660 --> 21:52.540\n Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems,\n\n21:52.540 --> 21:57.180\n they think of them as toys to tinker with.\n\n21:57.180 --> 21:59.180\n Oh, isn't this cool?\n\n21:59.180 --> 22:00.420\n And I feel this too.\n\n22:00.420 --> 22:01.260\n Isn't this cool?\n\n22:01.260 --> 22:02.420\n It is cool.\n\n22:02.420 --> 22:05.820\n But, you know, at a certain moment you might,\n\n22:05.820 --> 22:09.340\n isn't this nuclear explosion cool?\n\n22:09.340 --> 22:10.380\n Because it is.\n\n22:10.380 --> 22:12.140\n Or birth control pill cool.\n\n22:12.140 --> 22:14.900\n It's like, or transistor cool.\n\n22:14.900 --> 22:15.620\n Yeah.\n\n22:15.620 --> 22:19.220\n Well, the other thing too, and this is a weird problem\n\n22:19.220 --> 22:22.380\n in some sense, the robotics engineer types,\n\n22:22.380 --> 22:23.940\n they're thing people, right?\n\n22:23.940 --> 22:25.980\n I mean, the big classes of interest\n\n22:25.980 --> 22:28.700\n are interest in things versus interest in people.\n\n22:28.700 --> 22:30.700\n Some of my best friends are thing people.\n\n22:30.700 --> 22:31.380\n Yeah, right.\n\n22:31.380 --> 22:36.940\n And thing people are very, very clear, logical thinkers.\n\n22:36.940 --> 22:41.060\n And they're very outcome oriented and practical.\n\n22:41.060 --> 22:43.220\n Now, and that's all good.\n\n22:43.220 --> 22:45.980\n That makes the machinery and keeps it functioning.\n\n22:45.980 --> 22:49.260\n But there's a human side of the equation.\n\n22:49.260 --> 22:52.500\n And you get the extreme thing people,\n\n22:52.500 --> 22:55.220\n and you think, yeah, well, what about the human here?\n\n22:55.220 --> 22:58.260\n And when we're talking about, we've\n\n22:58.260 --> 23:00.020\n been talking about the necessity of having\n\n23:00.020 --> 23:03.340\n a technological enterprise embedded in an ethic.\n\n23:03.340 --> 23:06.300\n And you can ignore that, like most of the time, right?\n\n23:06.300 --> 23:09.420\n You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense\n\n23:09.420 --> 23:11.820\n when you're toying around with your toys.\n\n23:11.820 --> 23:14.020\n But when you're building an artificial intelligence,\n\n23:14.020 --> 23:19.060\n it's like, well, that's not a toy.\n\n23:19.060 --> 23:20.500\n That might be.\n\n23:20.500 --> 23:22.500\n Toy becomes the monster very quickly.\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:23.860\n Yeah, yes, yes.\n\n23:23.860 --> 23:26.860\n And this is a whole new kind of monster.\n\n23:26.860 --> 23:28.340\n And maybe it's already here.\n\n23:33.220 --> 23:35.060\n Yes, and you notice how many of those things\n\n23:35.060 --> 23:36.460\n you can no longer turn off.\n\n23:38.980 --> 23:41.180\n And what is it with you engineers and your inability\n\n23:41.180 --> 23:44.620\n to put off switches on things now?\n\n23:44.620 --> 23:47.100\n It's like, I have to hold this for five seconds for it\n\n23:47.100 --> 23:48.060\n to shut off.\n\n23:48.060 --> 23:48.900\n Or I can't figure it.\n\n23:48.900 --> 23:50.660\n I just want to shut it off.\n\n23:50.660 --> 23:51.780\n Click, off.\n\n23:51.780 --> 23:53.980\n Well, what is it with you humans that\n\n23:53.980 --> 23:56.980\n don't put off switches on other humans?\n\n23:56.980 --> 23:59.500\n Because there's a magic to the thing that you notice.\n\n23:59.500 --> 24:03.860\n And it hurts for both you and perhaps one day the thing\n\n24:03.860 --> 24:05.860\n itself to turn it off.\n\n24:05.860 --> 24:08.180\n And so you have to be very careful as an engineer\n\n24:08.180 --> 24:11.300\n adding off switches to things.\n\n24:11.300 --> 24:14.460\n I think it's a feature, not a bug, the off switch.\n\n24:14.460 --> 24:17.020\n The off switch gives a deadline to us humans,\n\n24:17.020 --> 24:19.740\n to systems of existence.\n\n24:19.740 --> 24:23.980\n It makes you, you know, death is the thing that really\n\n24:23.980 --> 24:25.980\n brings clarity to life.\n\n24:25.980 --> 24:27.060\n And I do think.\n\n24:27.060 --> 24:28.820\n Hence the flaming swords.\n\n24:28.820 --> 24:29.620\n The flaming sword.\n\n24:29.620 --> 24:33.260\n I do like your view of the flame, the bush,\n\n24:33.260 --> 24:36.700\n and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.\n\n24:36.700 --> 24:40.260\n It's also a transformation that kind of consumes\n\n24:40.260 --> 24:41.380\n the thing in the process.\n\n24:41.380 --> 24:44.300\n Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.\n\n24:44.300 --> 24:47.780\n You know, this is why you can't touch the Ark of the Covenant,\n\n24:47.780 --> 24:48.660\n for example.\n\n24:48.660 --> 24:52.020\n And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.\n\n24:52.020 --> 24:54.940\n It's like if you're 95% dead wood\n\n24:54.940 --> 24:57.140\n and you get too close to the flame,\n\n24:57.140 --> 25:00.460\n the 5% that's left might not be able to make it.\n\n25:03.260 --> 25:04.660\n So you think it's all chaff.\n\n25:04.660 --> 25:06.980\n But I think there is some aspect of destruction\n\n25:06.980 --> 25:12.540\n that is the old Bukowski line of do what you love\n\n25:12.540 --> 25:13.700\n and let it kill you.\n\n25:13.700 --> 25:16.540\n Don't you think that destruction is part of?\n\n25:16.540 --> 25:18.180\n That's humility.\n\n25:18.180 --> 25:19.020\n That's humility.\n\n25:19.020 --> 25:19.620\n You bet.\n\n25:19.620 --> 25:20.140\n You bet.\n\n25:20.140 --> 25:20.660\n You bet.\n\n25:20.660 --> 25:23.140\n It's like invite in the judgment.\n\n25:23.140 --> 25:24.700\n Invite in the judgment because maybe you\n\n25:24.700 --> 25:27.900\n can die a little bit instead of dying completely.\n\n25:27.900 --> 25:30.220\n I think it's Alfred North Whitehead.\n\n25:30.220 --> 25:33.380\n We can let our ideas die instead of us.\n\n25:33.380 --> 25:35.700\n We can have these partial personalities\n\n25:35.700 --> 25:37.460\n that we can burn off.\n\n25:37.460 --> 25:41.020\n And we can let them go before they become tyrannical pharaohs\n\n25:41.020 --> 25:43.380\n and we lose everything.\n\n25:43.380 --> 25:46.420\n And so, yeah, there's this optimal bite of death.\n\n25:46.420 --> 25:49.620\n And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?\n\n25:49.620 --> 25:52.500\n Like what if it was possible that if you died enough\n\n25:52.500 --> 25:56.220\n all the time that you could continue to live?\n\n25:56.220 --> 25:58.300\n And the thing is we already know that biologically\n\n25:58.300 --> 26:02.500\n because if you don't die properly all the time,\n\n26:02.500 --> 26:05.660\n well, it's cancerous outgrowths and it's\n\n26:05.660 --> 26:09.660\n a very fine balance between productivity\n\n26:09.660 --> 26:14.060\n on the biological front and the culling of that, right?\n\n26:14.060 --> 26:17.820\n Life is a real balance between growth and death.\n\n26:17.820 --> 26:20.340\n And so what would happen if you got that balance right?\n\n26:20.340 --> 26:21.540\n Well, we kind of know, right?\n\n26:21.540 --> 26:26.100\n Because if you live your life properly, so to speak,\n\n26:26.100 --> 26:28.780\n and you're humble enough to let your stupidity die\n\n26:28.780 --> 26:32.060\n before it takes you out, you will live longer.\n\n26:32.060 --> 26:34.180\n That's just a fact.\n\n26:34.180 --> 26:37.140\n Well, but then what's the ultimate extension of that?\n\n26:37.140 --> 26:38.740\n And the answer is we don't know.\n\n26:38.740 --> 26:40.180\n We have no idea.\n\n26:40.180 --> 26:42.980\n Well, let me ask you a difficult question because.\n\n26:42.980 --> 26:45.700\n As opposed to the easy ones that you've been asking so far.\n\n26:45.700 --> 26:50.900\n Well, Dostoevsky is always just a warm up.\n\n26:50.900 --> 26:54.660\n So if death every single day is the way\n\n26:54.660 --> 26:58.660\n to progress through life, you have become quite famous.\n\n26:58.660 --> 27:00.180\n Death and hell.\n\n27:00.180 --> 27:00.860\n Death and hell.\n\n27:00.860 --> 27:01.380\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n27:01.380 --> 27:04.620\n Because you don't want to forget the hell part.\n\n27:04.620 --> 27:10.820\n Do you worry that your fame traps you into the person\n\n27:10.820 --> 27:12.220\n that you were before?\n\n27:12.220 --> 27:15.260\n Yeah, well, Elvis became an Elvis impersonator\n\n27:15.260 --> 27:16.460\n by the time he died.\n\n27:16.460 --> 27:19.180\n Yeah, do you fear that you have become a Jordan Peterson\n\n27:19.180 --> 27:20.660\n impersonator?\n\n27:20.660 --> 27:25.860\n Do you fear of, in some part, becoming the famous suit\n\n27:25.860 --> 27:31.420\n wearing brilliant Jordan Peterson, the certainty in the pursuit\n\n27:31.420 --> 27:34.860\n of truth, always right?\n\n27:34.860 --> 27:36.940\n I think I worry about it more than anything else.\n\n27:36.940 --> 27:38.060\n I hope.\n\n27:38.060 --> 27:39.220\n I hope I do.\n\n27:39.220 --> 27:39.940\n I better.\n\n27:39.940 --> 27:43.100\n Has fame, to some degree, when you look at yourself\n\n27:43.100 --> 27:47.700\n in the mirror, in the quiet of your mind, has it corrupted you?\n\n27:47.700 --> 27:50.180\n No doubt, in some regard.\n\n27:50.180 --> 27:51.660\n I mean, it's a very difficult thing\n\n27:51.660 --> 27:57.100\n to avoid because things change around you.\n\n27:57.100 --> 28:01.860\n People are much more likely to do what you ask, for example.\n\n28:01.860 --> 28:03.860\n And so that's a danger because one\n\n28:03.860 --> 28:05.980\n of the things that keeps you dying properly\n\n28:05.980 --> 28:08.820\n is that people push back against you optimally.\n\n28:08.820 --> 28:11.540\n This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control,\n\n28:11.540 --> 28:15.180\n especially the tyrannical types that, say, run countries.\n\n28:15.180 --> 28:17.380\n Everyone around them stops saying,\n\n28:17.380 --> 28:20.140\n yeah, you're deviating a little bit there.\n\n28:20.140 --> 28:21.540\n They laugh at all their jokes.\n\n28:21.540 --> 28:22.780\n They open all their doors.\n\n28:22.780 --> 28:25.300\n They always want something from them.\n\n28:25.300 --> 28:27.300\n The red carpet's always rolled out.\n\n28:27.300 --> 28:29.820\n It's like, well, you think, wouldn't that be lovely?\n\n28:29.820 --> 28:34.020\n It's, well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you\n\n28:34.020 --> 28:36.300\n while you're on your way to perdition.\n\n28:36.300 --> 28:37.860\n That's not a good deal.\n\n28:37.860 --> 28:40.060\n You just get there more efficiently.\n\n28:40.060 --> 28:43.180\n And so one of the things that I've tried to learn to manage\n\n28:43.180 --> 28:48.300\n is to have people around me all the time who are critics, who\n\n28:48.300 --> 28:50.660\n are saying, yeah, I could have done that better.\n\n28:50.660 --> 28:52.820\n And you're a little too harsh there.\n\n28:52.820 --> 28:55.620\n And you're alienating people unnecessarily there.\n\n28:55.620 --> 28:58.940\n And you should have done some more background work there.\n\n28:58.940 --> 29:02.140\n And I think the responsibility attendant upon that\n\n29:02.140 --> 29:04.700\n increases as your influence increases.\n\n29:04.700 --> 29:08.900\n And as your influence increases, then that\n\n29:08.900 --> 29:12.340\n becomes a lot of responsibility.\n\n29:12.340 --> 29:14.820\n So and then maybe have an off day.\n\n29:14.820 --> 29:17.140\n And well, here's an example.\n\n29:17.140 --> 29:19.260\n I've been writing some columns lately\n\n29:19.260 --> 29:24.180\n about things that perturb me, like the forthcoming famine,\n\n29:24.180 --> 29:25.460\n for example.\n\n29:25.460 --> 29:30.980\n And it's hard to take those problems on.\n\n29:30.980 --> 29:34.020\n It's difficult to take those problems on in a serious\n\n29:34.020 --> 29:35.380\n manner, and it's frightening.\n\n29:35.380 --> 29:37.500\n And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage\n\n29:37.500 --> 29:40.740\n with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.\n\n29:40.740 --> 29:48.100\n And so I'm tempted to draw on anger as a motivating energy\n\n29:48.100 --> 29:52.020\n to help me overcome the resistance to doing this.\n\n29:52.020 --> 29:54.620\n But then that makes me more harsh and judgmental\n\n29:54.620 --> 29:57.940\n in my tone when I'm reading such things, for example,\n\n29:57.940 --> 30:00.260\n on YouTube than might be optimal.\n\n30:00.260 --> 30:03.260\n Now, I've had debates with people about that\n\n30:03.260 --> 30:05.540\n because I have friends who say, no,\n\n30:05.540 --> 30:10.500\n if you're calling out the environmentalists, globalists\n\n30:10.500 --> 30:12.820\n who are harassing the Dutch farmers,\n\n30:12.820 --> 30:15.860\n then a little anger is just the ticket.\n\n30:15.860 --> 30:18.900\n But then others say, well, you don't want to be too harsh\n\n30:18.900 --> 30:22.020\n because you alienate people who would otherwise listen to you.\n\n30:22.020 --> 30:24.900\n It's like, that's a hard balance to get right.\n\n30:24.900 --> 30:28.420\n But also maybe anger hardens your mind\n\n30:28.420 --> 30:31.220\n to where you don't notice the subtle quiet beauty\n\n30:31.220 --> 30:34.580\n of the world, the quiet love that's always there\n\n30:34.580 --> 30:36.140\n that permeates everything.\n\n30:36.140 --> 30:38.900\n Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world\n\n30:38.900 --> 30:41.820\n if it's the Nietzsche thing.\n\n30:41.820 --> 30:45.740\n Battle not with monsters lest ye become a monster.\n\n30:45.740 --> 30:47.420\n And if you gaze into the abyss,\n\n30:47.420 --> 30:50.780\n the abyss gazes also into you.\n\n30:50.780 --> 30:54.020\n But I would say, bring it on.\n\n30:56.260 --> 30:58.620\n Right, because I also say knowing\n\n30:58.620 --> 30:59.980\n that he's absolutely right.\n\n30:59.980 --> 31:03.380\n But if you gaze into the abyss long enough,\n\n31:03.380 --> 31:05.340\n you see the light, not the darkness.\n\n31:06.140 --> 31:08.300\n Are you sure about that?\n\n31:08.300 --> 31:10.540\n I'm betting my life on it.\n\n31:10.540 --> 31:12.140\n Yeah, that's a heck of a bet.\n\n31:12.140 --> 31:12.980\n Well, that's.\n\n31:12.980 --> 31:17.460\n Because it might distort your mind to where all you see.\n\n31:17.460 --> 31:18.300\n Is abyss.\n\n31:18.300 --> 31:21.140\n Is abyss, is the evil in this world.\n\n31:21.140 --> 31:24.140\n Well, then I would say you haven't looked long enough.\n\n31:24.140 --> 31:25.860\n You know, that's back to the.\n\n31:25.860 --> 31:26.700\n You just eliminated.\n\n31:26.700 --> 31:28.380\n The swords, the flaming swords.\n\n31:28.380 --> 31:31.060\n It's like, so I said the whole story of Christ\n\n31:31.060 --> 31:33.260\n was prefigured in that image.\n\n31:33.260 --> 31:36.820\n It's like the story of Christ psychologically\n\n31:36.820 --> 31:40.860\n is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.\n\n31:40.860 --> 31:42.940\n That's what it means, that's what the crucifix means.\n\n31:42.940 --> 31:45.100\n Psychologically, it's like gaze upon that\n\n31:45.100 --> 31:46.700\n which you are most afraid of.\n\n31:46.700 --> 31:48.500\n But that story doesn't end there.\n\n31:48.500 --> 31:53.420\n Because in the story, Christ goes through death into hell.\n\n31:53.420 --> 31:55.260\n So death isn't enough.\n\n31:55.260 --> 31:57.740\n The abyss, the abyss of innocent death\n\n31:57.740 --> 32:00.660\n is not sufficient to produce redemption.\n\n32:00.660 --> 32:03.100\n It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.\n\n32:03.100 --> 32:04.860\n And maybe that's true for everyone.\n\n32:06.180 --> 32:09.380\n And that's like, there is no more terrifying idea than that,\n\n32:09.380 --> 32:10.260\n by definition.\n\n32:10.260 --> 32:13.180\n And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?\n\n32:13.180 --> 32:17.700\n Well, who knows?\n\n32:17.700 --> 32:18.540\n Who knows?\n\n32:18.540 --> 32:22.460\n How often do you gaze upon death, your own?\n\n32:22.460 --> 32:26.060\n How often do you remember, remind yourself\n\n32:26.060 --> 32:27.460\n that this ride ends?\n\n32:27.460 --> 32:28.300\n Personally?\n\n32:28.300 --> 32:29.540\n Personally.\n\n32:29.540 --> 32:30.740\n All the time.\n\n32:30.740 --> 32:33.700\n Because you, as a deep thinker and a philosopher,\n\n32:33.700 --> 32:36.300\n it's easy to start philosophizing\n\n32:36.300 --> 32:39.300\n and forgetting that you're,\n\n32:39.300 --> 32:40.300\n you might die today.\n\n32:40.300 --> 32:42.220\n The angel of death sits on every word.\n\n32:43.620 --> 32:44.460\n How's that?\n\n32:45.700 --> 32:48.100\n How often do you actually consciously?\n\n32:48.100 --> 32:49.620\n All the time.\n\n32:49.620 --> 32:50.660\n Notice the angel?\n\n32:50.660 --> 32:51.500\n All the time.\n\n32:53.980 --> 32:57.700\n I think it's one of the things that made me peculiar.\n\n32:57.700 --> 32:59.980\n When I was in graduate school, you know,\n\n32:59.980 --> 33:03.140\n I thought about, I was, I had the thought of death\n\n33:03.140 --> 33:05.180\n in my mind all the time.\n\n33:05.180 --> 33:07.380\n And I noticed that many of the people that I was with,\n\n33:07.380 --> 33:09.940\n these were people I admired, fine.\n\n33:09.940 --> 33:12.100\n That wasn't part of their character,\n\n33:12.100 --> 33:13.820\n but it was definitely part of mine.\n\n33:13.820 --> 33:17.020\n I'd wake up every morning, this happened for years,\n\n33:17.020 --> 33:19.740\n think, time's short, get at it.\n\n33:19.740 --> 33:21.580\n Time's short, get at it.\n\n33:21.580 --> 33:22.620\n There's things to do.\n\n33:23.580 --> 33:25.620\n And so that was always, it's still there.\n\n33:25.620 --> 33:27.860\n And it's still there with, I would say,\n\n33:27.860 --> 33:30.060\n and it's unbearable in some sense.\n\n33:30.060 --> 33:31.220\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n33:31.220 --> 33:32.980\n Like what's your relationship?\n\n33:32.980 --> 33:33.820\n Yeah.\n\n33:33.820 --> 33:38.820\n You know, I was ready to die a year ago and not casually.\n\n33:40.420 --> 33:42.260\n I had people I loved, you know.\n\n33:47.100 --> 33:49.460\n So no, I'm not very worried about me,\n\n33:49.460 --> 33:52.100\n but I'm very worried about making a mistake.\n\n33:52.100 --> 33:53.260\n Yeah.\n\n33:53.260 --> 33:55.540\n I heard Elon Musk talk about that a couple of months ago.\n\n33:55.540 --> 33:57.860\n It was really a striking moment.\n\n33:57.860 --> 34:00.620\n Someone asked him about death and he said just offhand\n\n34:00.620 --> 34:02.100\n and then went on with the conversation.\n\n34:02.100 --> 34:03.420\n He said, I'd be a relief.\n\n34:03.420 --> 34:05.460\n And then he went on with the conversation.\n\n34:06.780 --> 34:09.420\n And I thought, well, you know,\n\n34:09.420 --> 34:11.740\n he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders.\n\n34:11.740 --> 34:13.340\n I'm sure that part of him thinks\n\n34:14.300 --> 34:18.100\n I'd be easier just if this wasn't here at all.\n\n34:18.100 --> 34:19.500\n Now he said it offhand,\n\n34:19.500 --> 34:21.900\n but it was a telling moment in my estimation.\n\n34:21.900 --> 34:26.060\n So for him, that's a why live question.\n\n34:26.060 --> 34:30.220\n The exhaustion of life, if you call it life is suffering,\n\n34:30.220 --> 34:32.260\n but the hardship.\n\n34:32.260 --> 34:33.940\n I'm more afraid of hell than death.\n\n34:36.380 --> 34:38.860\n You're afraid of the thing that follows?\n\n34:40.140 --> 34:42.660\n I don't know if it follows or if it's always here.\n\n34:44.420 --> 34:46.020\n And I think we're gonna find out.\n\n34:47.300 --> 34:50.180\n What's the connection between death and hell?\n\n34:50.180 --> 34:51.020\n I don't know.\n\n34:53.380 --> 34:54.540\n I don't know.\n\n34:54.540 --> 34:55.380\n I don't know.\n\n34:55.380 --> 34:58.500\n Is there something that needs to be done before you arrive?\n\n34:58.500 --> 35:00.300\n You're more likely to die terribly\n\n35:00.300 --> 35:03.780\n if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.\n\n35:03.780 --> 35:04.900\n That's one connection.\n\n35:04.900 --> 35:08.620\n And terribly is a very deep kind of concept.\n\n35:08.620 --> 35:09.460\n Okay.\n\n35:09.460 --> 35:10.300\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n35:13.020 --> 35:14.980\n And that's the definition, by the way.\n\n35:16.220 --> 35:17.820\n What do you make of Elon Musk?\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:19.500\n You've spoken about him a bit.\n\n35:19.500 --> 35:20.340\n You met him.\n\n35:20.340 --> 35:21.420\n I'm struck with admiration.\n\n35:22.660 --> 35:23.500\n That's what I make of him.\n\n35:23.500 --> 35:26.820\n And I always think of that as a primary.\n\n35:26.820 --> 35:29.980\n Well, it's like, do you find this comedian funny?\n\n35:29.980 --> 35:31.940\n It's like, well, I laugh at him.\n\n35:31.940 --> 35:32.780\n You know what I mean?\n\n35:32.780 --> 35:34.780\n It's not propositional again.\n\n35:34.780 --> 35:36.660\n And so I would,\n\n35:36.660 --> 35:41.020\n there are things I would like to ask Mr. Musk about.\n\n35:41.020 --> 35:42.660\n The Mars venture.\n\n35:42.660 --> 35:44.260\n I don't know what he's up to there.\n\n35:44.260 --> 35:47.900\n It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense\n\n35:47.900 --> 35:49.100\n because I think, well, it'd be easier\n\n35:49.100 --> 35:52.300\n just to build an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.\n\n35:52.300 --> 35:54.340\n Well, how much of the human endeavor is absurd?\n\n35:54.340 --> 35:56.940\n Well, that's what it needs to say.\n\n35:56.940 --> 35:59.620\n Great men are seldom credited with their stupidity.\n\n35:59.620 --> 36:01.580\n Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?\n\n36:01.580 --> 36:03.860\n I mean, obviously he's building rockets.\n\n36:03.860 --> 36:06.100\n Now he's motivated because he wants to build\n\n36:06.100 --> 36:08.980\n a platform for life on Mars.\n\n36:08.980 --> 36:10.220\n Is that a good idea?\n\n36:11.580 --> 36:13.300\n Who am I to say?\n\n36:13.300 --> 36:14.860\n He's building the rockets, man.\n\n36:14.860 --> 36:16.700\n But I'd like to ask him about it.\n\n36:16.700 --> 36:19.300\n I would like to see that conversation.\n\n36:19.300 --> 36:24.300\n I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline,\n\n36:24.580 --> 36:29.260\n I think these, several of his ideas like Mars,\n\n36:29.260 --> 36:31.900\n like humans becoming a multi planetary species\n\n36:31.900 --> 36:35.580\n could be one of the things that human civilization\n\n36:35.580 --> 36:39.740\n looks back at as, duh, I can't believe\n\n36:39.740 --> 36:42.100\n he is one of the few people that was really pushing\n\n36:42.100 --> 36:45.140\n this idea because it's the obvious thing\n\n36:45.140 --> 36:48.140\n for society, for life to survive.\n\n36:48.140 --> 36:49.540\n Yeah, well, it isn't obvious to me\n\n36:49.540 --> 36:52.580\n that I'm in any position to evaluate Elon Musk.\n\n36:52.580 --> 36:53.820\n Like I would like to talk to him\n\n36:53.820 --> 36:55.460\n and find out what he's up to and why,\n\n36:55.460 --> 36:58.620\n but I mean, he's an impossible person.\n\n36:58.620 --> 37:01.420\n What he's done is impossible, all of it.\n\n37:01.420 --> 37:03.580\n It's like he built an electric car that works.\n\n37:03.580 --> 37:06.420\n Now, does it work completely and will it replace gas cars\n\n37:06.420 --> 37:07.260\n or should it?\n\n37:07.260 --> 37:10.700\n I don't know, but if we're gonna build electric cars,\n\n37:10.700 --> 37:14.220\n he seems to be the best at that by a lot.\n\n37:14.220 --> 37:16.740\n And he more or less did that, people carp about him,\n\n37:16.740 --> 37:18.980\n but he more or less did that by himself.\n\n37:18.980 --> 37:21.460\n I know he's very good at distributing responsibility\n\n37:21.460 --> 37:23.260\n and all of that, but he's the spearhead.\n\n37:23.260 --> 37:25.140\n And then that was pretty hard.\n\n37:25.140 --> 37:28.780\n And then he built a rocket at like one 10th\n\n37:28.780 --> 37:30.620\n the price of NASA rockets.\n\n37:30.620 --> 37:33.380\n And then he shot his car out into space.\n\n37:33.380 --> 37:34.860\n That's pretty hard.\n\n37:34.860 --> 37:38.020\n And then he's building this boring company,\n\n37:38.020 --> 37:41.180\n more or less as a, what would you call it?\n\n37:41.180 --> 37:44.500\n It's sort of, it's this whimsical joke in some sense,\n\n37:44.500 --> 37:46.260\n but it's not a joke.\n\n37:46.260 --> 37:47.300\n He's amazing.\n\n37:47.300 --> 37:51.380\n And Neuralink delving into the depths of the mind.\n\n37:51.380 --> 37:52.220\n And Starlink.\n\n37:52.220 --> 37:55.220\n It's like, go Elon, as far as I'm concerned.\n\n37:55.220 --> 37:58.540\n And then he puts his finger on things so oddly.\n\n37:58.540 --> 38:01.220\n The problem is underpopulation.\n\n38:01.220 --> 38:02.540\n It's like, I think so too.\n\n38:02.540 --> 38:05.220\n I think it's a terrible problem that we're,\n\n38:05.220 --> 38:09.860\n the West for example, is no longer at replacement\n\n38:09.860 --> 38:10.980\n with regard to birth rate.\n\n38:10.980 --> 38:13.380\n It means we've abandoned the Virgin and the child\n\n38:13.380 --> 38:14.940\n in a most fundamental sense.\n\n38:14.940 --> 38:16.860\n It's a bloody catastrophe.\n\n38:16.860 --> 38:19.980\n And Musk, he sees it clear as can be.\n\n38:19.980 --> 38:22.500\n It's like, wow, and where everyone else is running around\n\n38:22.500 --> 38:24.100\n going, oh, there's too many people.\n\n38:24.100 --> 38:26.860\n It's like, nope, got that.\n\n38:26.860 --> 38:30.220\n Not only, see, I've learned that there are falsehoods\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:33.260\n and lies and there are antitruths.\n\n38:33.260 --> 38:36.060\n And an antitruth is something that's so preposterous\n\n38:36.060 --> 38:39.620\n that you couldn't make a claim\n\n38:39.620 --> 38:42.660\n that's more opposite to the truth.\n\n38:42.660 --> 38:44.940\n And the claim that there are too many people\n\n38:44.940 --> 38:46.740\n on the planet is an antitruth.\n\n38:46.740 --> 38:50.580\n So, you know, people say, well, you have to accept\n\n38:50.580 --> 38:52.060\n limits to growth and et cetera.\n\n38:52.060 --> 38:56.300\n It's like, I have to accept the limits\n\n38:56.300 --> 38:58.260\n that you're going to impose on me\n\n38:58.260 --> 39:00.700\n because you're frightened of the future.\n\n39:00.700 --> 39:02.500\n That's your theory, isn't it?\n\n39:02.500 --> 39:03.340\n Okay.\n\n39:04.460 --> 39:05.700\n Well, it's an idea.\n\n39:05.700 --> 39:07.060\n It could be a right idea.\n\n39:07.060 --> 39:08.340\n It could be a wrong idea.\n\n39:08.340 --> 39:09.940\n I don't think antitruth.\n\n39:11.140 --> 39:13.740\n Here, I'll tell you why it's the wrong idea, I think.\n\n39:13.740 --> 39:17.540\n So imagine that there's an emergency, dragon.\n\n39:17.540 --> 39:19.140\n There's a dragon.\n\n39:19.140 --> 39:21.140\n Someone comes and says, there's a dragon.\n\n39:21.140 --> 39:22.620\n I'm the guy to deal with it.\n\n39:23.500 --> 39:25.100\n That's what the environmentalists say,\n\n39:25.100 --> 39:28.540\n the radical types who push limits to growth.\n\n39:28.540 --> 39:30.460\n Then I look at them and I think, okay,\n\n39:31.940 --> 39:34.420\n is that dragon real or not?\n\n39:34.420 --> 39:35.700\n That's one question.\n\n39:35.700 --> 39:36.540\n Well, is the...\n\n39:36.540 --> 39:38.100\n I ask that question of myself every time\n\n39:38.100 --> 39:39.180\n when I spend time alone.\n\n39:39.180 --> 39:42.220\n Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?\n\n39:42.220 --> 39:45.740\n Yes or no? I'll just leave that aside for the time being.\n\n39:45.740 --> 39:47.700\n I think you can make a case both ways\n\n39:47.700 --> 39:49.460\n for a bunch of different reasons.\n\n39:49.460 --> 39:51.660\n And it's not a trivial concern.\n\n39:51.660 --> 39:54.100\n And we've overfished the oceans terribly.\n\n39:54.100 --> 39:58.340\n And there are environmental issues that are looming large.\n\n39:58.340 --> 40:00.980\n Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not\n\n40:00.980 --> 40:03.660\n is a whole different question, but we won't get into that.\n\n40:03.660 --> 40:04.940\n That's not the issue.\n\n40:04.940 --> 40:07.100\n You're clamoring about a dragon.\n\n40:07.100 --> 40:08.660\n Okay.\n\n40:08.660 --> 40:10.460\n Why should I listen to you?\n\n40:10.460 --> 40:13.460\n Well, let's see how you're reacting to the dragon.\n\n40:13.460 --> 40:16.500\n First of all, you're scared stiff and in a state of panic.\n\n40:17.780 --> 40:20.940\n That might indicate you're not the man for the job.\n\n40:20.940 --> 40:24.500\n Second, you're willing to use compulsion\n\n40:24.500 --> 40:27.620\n to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.\n\n40:27.620 --> 40:30.260\n So now not only are you terrified,\n\n40:30.260 --> 40:32.540\n you're a terrified tyrant.\n\n40:32.540 --> 40:34.860\n So then I would say, well, then you're not the Moses\n\n40:34.860 --> 40:38.580\n that we need to lead us out of this particular exodus.\n\n40:38.580 --> 40:41.460\n And maybe that's a neurological explanation.\n\n40:41.460 --> 40:45.060\n It's like, if you're so afraid of what you're facing\n\n40:45.060 --> 40:47.940\n that you're terrified into paralysis and nihilism\n\n40:47.940 --> 40:50.340\n and that you're willing to use tyrannical compulsion\n\n40:50.340 --> 40:54.300\n to get your way, you are not the right leader for the time.\n\n40:54.300 --> 40:56.340\n So then I like someone like Bjorn Lomborg\n\n40:56.340 --> 40:59.100\n or Matt Ridley or Marion Toopy.\n\n40:59.100 --> 41:00.580\n And they say, well, look,\n\n41:00.580 --> 41:03.140\n we've got our environmental problems.\n\n41:03.140 --> 41:06.860\n And maybe you could make a case\n\n41:06.860 --> 41:11.100\n that there's a Malthusian element in some situations,\n\n41:11.100 --> 41:14.540\n but fundamentally the track record of the human race\n\n41:14.540 --> 41:18.500\n is that we learn very fast and faster all the time\n\n41:18.500 --> 41:23.020\n to do more with less, and we've got this.\n\n41:23.020 --> 41:27.820\n And I think, yes, to that idea.\n\n41:27.820 --> 41:32.420\n And I think about it in a fundamental way.\n\n41:32.420 --> 41:36.540\n It's like, I trust Lomborg, I trust Toopy,\n\n41:36.540 --> 41:38.340\n trust Matt Ridley.\n\n41:38.340 --> 41:40.140\n They've thought about these things deeply.\n\n41:40.140 --> 41:40.980\n They're not just saying,\n\n41:40.980 --> 41:42.260\n oh, the environment doesn't matter,\n\n41:42.260 --> 41:44.100\n whatever the environment is.\n\n41:45.180 --> 41:47.540\n You know, the environment, I don't even know what that is.\n\n41:47.540 --> 41:49.660\n That's everything, the environment.\n\n41:49.660 --> 41:51.340\n I'm concerned about the environment.\n\n41:51.340 --> 41:55.380\n It's like, which is, how is that different\n\n41:55.380 --> 41:57.620\n than saying I'm worried about everything?\n\n41:57.620 --> 42:00.780\n How are those statements different semantically?\n\n42:00.780 --> 42:02.820\n Well, yeah, the environment, it could be,\n\n42:02.820 --> 42:04.980\n I'm worried about human society.\n\n42:04.980 --> 42:07.580\n A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about\n\n42:07.580 --> 42:09.620\n because there's so much involved for sure.\n\n42:09.620 --> 42:10.940\n Yeah, everything.\n\n42:10.940 --> 42:12.700\n And then these models,\n\n42:12.700 --> 42:14.140\n because people have gone after me\n\n42:14.140 --> 42:15.940\n because I don't buy the climate models.\n\n42:15.940 --> 42:18.220\n Well, I think about the climate models\n\n42:18.220 --> 42:21.380\n as extended into the economic models\n\n42:21.380 --> 42:22.980\n because the climate model is,\n\n42:23.980 --> 42:25.940\n well, there's gonna be a certain degree of heating,\n\n42:25.940 --> 42:27.540\n let's say by 2100.\n\n42:27.540 --> 42:30.900\n It's like, okay, some of that might be human generated.\n\n42:30.900 --> 42:33.700\n Some of it's a consequence of warming after the ice age.\n\n42:33.700 --> 42:36.260\n This has happened before, but fair enough.\n\n42:36.260 --> 42:38.620\n Let's take your presumption.\n\n42:38.620 --> 42:40.780\n Although there are multiple presumptions\n\n42:40.780 --> 42:44.860\n and any error in your model multiplies as time extends,\n\n42:44.860 --> 42:46.740\n but have it your way.\n\n42:46.740 --> 42:48.740\n Okay, now we're gonna extend the climate model,\n\n42:48.740 --> 42:50.860\n so to speak, into the economic model.\n\n42:50.860 --> 42:53.780\n So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte,\n\n42:55.060 --> 42:57.820\n third biggest company in the US,\n\n42:59.140 --> 43:01.940\n 300,000 employees, major league consultants.\n\n43:01.940 --> 43:03.740\n They just produced a report in May.\n\n43:03.740 --> 43:05.460\n I wrote an article for it in the Telegraph,\n\n43:05.460 --> 43:08.780\n which I'm gonna release this week on my YouTube channel.\n\n43:08.780 --> 43:12.140\n Said, well, if we get the climate problem\n\n43:12.140 --> 43:14.620\n under control economically,\n\n43:14.620 --> 43:17.140\n because that's where the models are now being generated\n\n43:17.140 --> 43:18.020\n on the economic front.\n\n43:18.020 --> 43:21.380\n So now we have to model the environment, that's climate,\n\n43:21.380 --> 43:23.620\n and we have to model the economy,\n\n43:23.620 --> 43:26.540\n and then we have to model their joint interaction,\n\n43:26.540 --> 43:29.780\n and then we have to predict 100 years into the future,\n\n43:29.780 --> 43:32.660\n and then we have to put a dollar value on that,\n\n43:32.660 --> 43:35.340\n and then we have to claim that we can do that,\n\n43:35.340 --> 43:38.700\n which we can't, and then this is our conclusion.\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:43.820\n We're going to go through a difficult period of privation,\n\n43:43.820 --> 43:45.700\n because if we don't accept limits to growth,\n\n43:45.700 --> 43:47.340\n there's gonna be a catastrophe,\n\n43:47.340 --> 43:49.380\n 50 years in the future or thereabouts.\n\n43:49.380 --> 43:52.060\n And so to avert that catastrophe,\n\n43:52.060 --> 43:55.820\n we are going to make people poorer now.\n\n43:55.820 --> 43:56.940\n How much poorer?\n\n43:56.940 --> 43:58.820\n Well, not a lot compared to how much richer\n\n43:58.820 --> 44:01.460\n they're going to be, but definitely,\n\n44:01.460 --> 44:03.100\n and they say this in their own models,\n\n44:03.100 --> 44:06.340\n definitely poorer, definitely poorer\n\n44:06.340 --> 44:09.940\n than they would be if we just left them the hell alone.\n\n44:09.940 --> 44:14.220\n And so then I think, okay, poorer, eh?\n\n44:14.220 --> 44:15.220\n Who?\n\n44:15.220 --> 44:17.140\n Well, let's look at it biologically.\n\n44:17.140 --> 44:22.140\n Got a hierarchy, right, of stability and security.\n\n44:22.900 --> 44:25.020\n That's a hierarchy or one type.\n\n44:25.020 --> 44:27.700\n You stress a hierarchy like that, a social hierarchy.\n\n44:27.700 --> 44:30.660\n So there's birds in an environment,\n\n44:30.660 --> 44:32.420\n and an avian flu comes in,\n\n44:32.420 --> 44:34.540\n and then you look at the birds in the social hierarchy,\n\n44:34.540 --> 44:38.420\n and the low ranking birds have the worst nests.\n\n44:38.420 --> 44:40.580\n So they're most exposed to wind and rain and sun\n\n44:40.580 --> 44:42.780\n and farthest from food supplies\n\n44:42.780 --> 44:44.140\n and most exposed to predators.\n\n44:44.140 --> 44:45.740\n And so those birds are stressed,\n\n44:45.740 --> 44:47.980\n which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy.\n\n44:47.980 --> 44:51.060\n You're more stressed because your life is more uncertain.\n\n44:51.060 --> 44:51.900\n You're more stressed.\n\n44:51.900 --> 44:53.780\n Your immunological function is compromised\n\n44:53.780 --> 44:55.180\n because of that.\n\n44:55.180 --> 44:57.580\n You're sacrificing the future for the present.\n\n44:58.460 --> 44:59.700\n An avian flu comes in,\n\n44:59.700 --> 45:01.940\n and the birds die from the bottom up.\n\n45:01.940 --> 45:03.620\n That happens in every epidemic.\n\n45:03.620 --> 45:06.380\n You die from the bottom up.\n\n45:06.380 --> 45:10.780\n Okay, so they say when the aristocracy catches a cold,\n\n45:10.780 --> 45:13.020\n the working class dies of pneumonia.\n\n45:13.020 --> 45:15.460\n All right, so now we're gonna make people poorer.\n\n45:16.820 --> 45:18.500\n Okay, who?\n\n45:18.500 --> 45:22.020\n Well, we know who we make poor when we make people poorer.\n\n45:22.020 --> 45:27.020\n We make those who are barely hanging on poorer.\n\n45:27.180 --> 45:28.900\n And what does that mean?\n\n45:28.900 --> 45:30.900\n It means they die.\n\n45:30.900 --> 45:34.420\n And so what the Deloitte consultants are basically saying\n\n45:34.420 --> 45:38.300\n is, well, you know, it's kind of unfortunate,\n\n45:39.180 --> 45:41.700\n but according to our models,\n\n45:41.700 --> 45:44.620\n a lot of poor people are gonna have to die\n\n45:44.620 --> 45:47.340\n so that a lot more poor people don't die in the future.\n\n45:47.340 --> 45:49.460\n It's like, okay, hold on a sec.\n\n45:49.460 --> 45:51.540\n Which of those two things am I supposed to regard\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:52.780\n with certainty?\n\n45:52.780 --> 45:54.340\n The hypothetical poor people\n\n45:54.340 --> 45:57.820\n that you're gonna hypothetically save 100 years from now,\n\n45:57.820 --> 46:00.060\n or the actual poor people\n\n46:00.060 --> 46:04.180\n that you are actually going to kill in the next 10 years?\n\n46:05.140 --> 46:07.980\n Well, I'm gonna cast my lot with the actual poor people\n\n46:07.980 --> 46:09.740\n that you're actually going to kill.\n\n46:11.140 --> 46:13.060\n And so, and then I think further,\n\n46:13.060 --> 46:16.220\n it's like, well, okay, the Deloitte consultants,\n\n46:16.220 --> 46:18.140\n have you actually modeled the world?\n\n46:18.140 --> 46:20.620\n Or is this a big advertising shtick\n\n46:20.620 --> 46:22.620\n designed to attract your corporate clients\n\n46:22.620 --> 46:24.900\n with demonstration that you're so intelligent\n\n46:24.900 --> 46:27.260\n that you can actually model the entire ecosystem\n\n46:27.260 --> 46:30.100\n of the world, including the economic system,\n\n46:30.100 --> 46:32.500\n and predict it 100 years forward?\n\n46:32.500 --> 46:34.220\n And isn't there a bit of a moral hazard\n\n46:34.220 --> 46:36.340\n in making a claim like that?\n\n46:36.340 --> 46:39.180\n Just like just a trifle, especially when...\n\n46:39.180 --> 46:42.100\n So I talked to Bjorn Lomborg and Michael Yon last week.\n\n46:42.100 --> 46:47.100\n I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year.\n\n46:47.100 --> 46:51.380\n 150 million people will suffer food insecurity.\n\n46:51.380 --> 46:53.500\n Food insecurity.\n\n46:53.500 --> 46:57.140\n Yeah, food insecurity, that's the bloody buzzword.\n\n46:57.140 --> 46:58.340\n Famine.\n\n46:58.340 --> 47:02.380\n Well, Michael Yon thought 1.2 billion,\n\n47:02.380 --> 47:05.180\n and then that it'll spiral because he said,\n\n47:05.180 --> 47:08.780\n what happens in a famine is that the governments go nuts,\n\n47:08.780 --> 47:12.220\n crazy, the governments destabilize,\n\n47:12.220 --> 47:16.180\n and then they appropriate the food from the farmers.\n\n47:16.180 --> 47:18.380\n Then the farmers don't have any money.\n\n47:18.380 --> 47:20.380\n Then they can't grow crops.\n\n47:20.380 --> 47:22.940\n And I think, yeah, that's exactly what they do.\n\n47:22.940 --> 47:24.980\n That's exactly what would happen.\n\n47:24.980 --> 47:28.060\n And so Yon told me 1.2 billion,\n\n47:28.060 --> 47:30.580\n and then Bjorn Lomborg said the same thing.\n\n47:30.580 --> 47:31.620\n I didn't even ask him.\n\n47:31.620 --> 47:33.740\n He just made it as an offhand comment.\n\n47:35.260 --> 47:36.300\n So...\n\n47:36.300 --> 47:40.220\n Let me ask you about the famine of the 30s.\n\n47:40.220 --> 47:41.060\n Yeah.\n\n47:41.060 --> 47:42.580\n Do you think...\n\n47:42.580 --> 47:43.420\n In the Ukraine?\n\n47:43.420 --> 47:44.260\n In the Ukraine.\n\n47:44.260 --> 47:45.100\n Oh, yeah.\n\n47:45.100 --> 47:45.940\n Fun, fun, fun.\n\n47:45.940 --> 47:48.660\n Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned\n\n47:48.660 --> 47:51.420\n in the last few sentences kind of echo\n\n47:51.420 --> 47:53.820\n to that part of human history.\n\n47:53.820 --> 47:55.660\n The hole in the door.\n\n47:55.660 --> 47:56.500\n Do you...\n\n47:56.500 --> 47:57.340\n No one knows about.\n\n47:58.460 --> 48:01.460\n Well, now I've just spent four weeks in Ukraine.\n\n48:01.460 --> 48:02.300\n Oh, yeah.\n\n48:02.300 --> 48:04.340\n There's different parts of the world that still,\n\n48:04.340 --> 48:07.740\n even if they don't know, they know.\n\n48:07.740 --> 48:08.580\n Yeah, right.\n\n48:08.580 --> 48:09.820\n They feel.\n\n48:09.820 --> 48:12.740\n They feel history runs in the blood.\n\n48:12.740 --> 48:14.980\n The Dutch knew, in some sense.\n\n48:14.980 --> 48:16.820\n They had a famine at the end of World War II.\n\n48:16.820 --> 48:18.460\n And part of the reason the Dutch farmers\n\n48:18.460 --> 48:21.340\n are so unbelievably efficient and productive\n\n48:21.340 --> 48:23.740\n is that the Dutch swore at the end of World War II\n\n48:23.740 --> 48:26.380\n that that was not going to happen again.\n\n48:26.380 --> 48:29.660\n And then they had to scrape land out of the ocean\n\n48:29.660 --> 48:31.260\n because Holland, that's quite a country.\n\n48:31.260 --> 48:32.780\n It shouldn't even exist.\n\n48:32.780 --> 48:35.180\n The fact that it's the world's number two exporter.\n\n48:35.180 --> 48:36.020\n You know that?\n\n48:36.020 --> 48:37.140\n It's the world's number two exporter\n\n48:37.140 --> 48:39.900\n of agricultural products, Holland.\n\n48:39.900 --> 48:43.340\n It's like, I don't think it's as big as Massachusetts.\n\n48:43.340 --> 48:44.620\n It's this little tiny place.\n\n48:44.620 --> 48:46.420\n It shouldn't even exist.\n\n48:46.420 --> 48:49.380\n And they want to put, here's the plan.\n\n48:49.380 --> 48:52.660\n Let's put 30% of the farmers out of business.\n\n48:52.660 --> 48:55.740\n While the broader ecosystem of agricultural production\n\n48:55.740 --> 48:58.420\n in Holland is 6% of their GDP.\n\n48:58.420 --> 49:01.580\n Now these centralizing politicians think,\n\n49:01.580 --> 49:03.480\n tell me if I'm stupid about this.\n\n49:03.480 --> 49:08.480\n Take an industry, you knock it back by fiat by 30%.\n\n49:12.840 --> 49:15.240\n Now it runs on like a 3% profit margin.\n\n49:15.240 --> 49:17.420\n Now you're going to kill 30% of it.\n\n49:18.660 --> 49:20.540\n How are you not going to bring the whole thing down?\n\n49:20.540 --> 49:22.880\n The whole farming ecosystem down?\n\n49:22.880 --> 49:27.140\n How are you not going to impoverish the transport systems?\n\n49:27.140 --> 49:30.740\n How are you not going to demolish the grocery stores?\n\n49:30.740 --> 49:33.720\n You can't take something like that and pare it back\n\n49:33.720 --> 49:37.120\n by fiat by 30% and not kill it.\n\n49:37.120 --> 49:39.400\n I can't see how you can do that.\n\n49:39.400 --> 49:41.960\n I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.\n\n49:41.960 --> 49:43.880\n We broke the supply chains.\n\n49:43.880 --> 49:45.580\n We tried buying something lately.\n\n49:46.540 --> 49:49.940\n You can't, and wait, and aren't the Chinese threatening\n\n49:49.940 --> 49:50.940\n Taiwan at the moment?\n\n49:50.940 --> 49:52.800\n What are we going to do without chips?\n\n49:53.840 --> 49:56.680\n So I don't know what these people are thinking.\n\n49:56.680 --> 49:58.280\n And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?\n\n49:58.280 --> 49:59.620\n Well, the Deloitte people are thinking,\n\n49:59.620 --> 50:01.420\n aren't we smart and shouldn't we be hired\n\n50:01.420 --> 50:02.920\n by our corporate employers?\n\n50:02.920 --> 50:05.860\n It's like, okay, too bad about the poor.\n\n50:06.760 --> 50:09.700\n What are the environmentalists thinking?\n\n50:09.700 --> 50:11.080\n We love the planet.\n\n50:11.080 --> 50:12.620\n It's like, do you?\n\n50:12.620 --> 50:13.980\n We love the poor.\n\n50:13.980 --> 50:14.820\n Do you?\n\n50:14.820 --> 50:17.080\n Okay, let's pit the planet against the poor.\n\n50:17.080 --> 50:17.920\n Who wins?\n\n50:17.920 --> 50:18.740\n The planet.\n\n50:18.740 --> 50:21.120\n Okay, you don't love the poor that much.\n\n50:21.120 --> 50:24.800\n Do you love the planet or do you hate capitalism?\n\n50:24.800 --> 50:27.200\n Let's pit those two things against each other.\n\n50:27.200 --> 50:29.880\n Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.\n\n50:29.880 --> 50:31.460\n How can we tell?\n\n50:31.460 --> 50:33.400\n Because you're willing to break it.\n\n50:33.400 --> 50:34.580\n And you know what's going to happen.\n\n50:34.580 --> 50:35.960\n So what's going to happen in Sri Lanka\n\n50:35.960 --> 50:39.000\n with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?\n\n50:39.000 --> 50:40.920\n Are they going to eat all the animals?\n\n50:40.920 --> 50:42.520\n Are they going to burn all the firewood?\n\n50:42.520 --> 50:44.560\n They're stockpiling firewood in Germany.\n\n50:45.560 --> 50:48.320\n It's like, so is your environmental globalist utopia\n\n50:49.280 --> 50:51.720\n going to kill the poor and destroy the planet?\n\n50:51.720 --> 50:54.240\n And that's okay, because we'll wipe out capitalism.\n\n50:54.240 --> 50:55.380\n It's like, okay.\n\n50:55.380 --> 50:57.840\n Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon\n\n50:57.840 --> 51:01.060\n drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world,\n\n51:01.060 --> 51:03.160\n some of which can destroy that world.\n\n51:03.160 --> 51:07.380\n Now, what do you think of that theory about trustworthiness?\n\n51:07.380 --> 51:09.520\n If the dragon that you're facing\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:12.020\n turns you into a terrified tyrant,\n\n51:12.020 --> 51:14.240\n you're not the man for the job.\n\n51:14.240 --> 51:15.540\n Is that a good theory?\n\n51:15.540 --> 51:16.640\n It's an interesting theory.\n\n51:16.640 --> 51:18.440\n Let me use that theory to challenge,\n\n51:18.440 --> 51:20.960\n because what does terror look like?\n\n51:20.960 --> 51:25.420\n Let me table the turns, turn the tables on you.\n\n51:27.140 --> 51:32.140\n You are terrified, afraid, concerned about the dragon\n\n51:37.120 --> 51:41.800\n of something we can call communism, Marxism.\n\n51:43.520 --> 51:45.160\n Am I terrified of it?\n\n51:45.160 --> 51:46.000\n Well, okay, okay.\n\n51:46.000 --> 51:47.040\n I'm not terrified enough to be a tyrant.\n\n51:47.040 --> 51:48.840\n Your theories had two components.\n\n51:48.840 --> 51:49.960\n Yeah?\n\n51:49.960 --> 51:51.240\n I'm not paralyzed.\n\n51:51.240 --> 51:52.080\n Had a dragon.\n\n51:52.080 --> 51:55.280\n Yeah, I'm not paralyzed, and I don't wanna be a tyrant.\n\n51:55.280 --> 51:58.320\n The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.\n\n51:59.240 --> 52:00.760\n But you are very concerned.\n\n52:00.760 --> 52:02.680\n The intensity of your feeling\n\n52:05.600 --> 52:08.320\n does not give much space,\n\n52:08.320 --> 52:11.000\n actually, at least in your public persona,\n\n52:11.000 --> 52:13.640\n for sitting quietly with the dragon\n\n52:13.640 --> 52:15.160\n and sipping on a couple of beers\n\n52:15.160 --> 52:16.720\n and thinking about this thing.\n\n52:16.720 --> 52:20.440\n The intensity of your anger,\n\n52:20.440 --> 52:24.960\n concern about certain things you're seeing in society,\n\n52:24.960 --> 52:27.080\n is that going to drive you off the path\n\n52:27.080 --> 52:29.440\n that ultimately takes us to a better world?\n\n52:29.440 --> 52:30.760\n That's a good question.\n\n52:30.760 --> 52:33.740\n I mean, I'm trying to get that right.\n\n52:33.740 --> 52:36.440\n So we've kind of come to a cultural conclusion\n\n52:36.440 --> 52:37.520\n about the Nazis.\n\n52:38.520 --> 52:40.800\n Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?\n\n52:40.800 --> 52:42.740\n Seems the answer to that is yes.\n\n52:42.740 --> 52:46.420\n Well, actually, let me push back here.\n\n52:47.720 --> 52:50.760\n I also don't trust people who are angry about the Nazis.\n\n52:51.640 --> 52:53.120\n I mean the actual Nazis.\n\n52:53.120 --> 52:58.120\n Well, as you know, there's a lot of people in the world\n\n53:00.360 --> 53:04.560\n that use actual Nazis to mean a lot of things.\n\n53:04.560 --> 53:05.400\n I know, I know.\n\n53:05.400 --> 53:07.240\n One of them is very important to me.\n\n53:07.240 --> 53:08.400\n Me, for example.\n\n53:08.400 --> 53:09.240\n Well, yes.\n\n53:09.240 --> 53:13.800\n He's a Nazi, or magical super Nazi, as it turns out.\n\n53:13.800 --> 53:15.640\n I think they actually sort of steel man\n\n53:15.640 --> 53:16.840\n all their perspectives.\n\n53:16.840 --> 53:19.920\n I think a lot of people that call you a Nazi mean it.\n\n53:20.920 --> 53:21.760\n Yeah.\n\n53:23.760 --> 53:24.600\n I'm aware of that.\n\n53:24.600 --> 53:26.480\n There's an important thing there though,\n\n53:26.480 --> 53:29.520\n because I went to the front in Ukraine,\n\n53:29.520 --> 53:34.520\n and a lot of the people that lost their home\n\n53:35.080 --> 53:38.480\n or they're kind of, that got to interact a lot\n\n53:38.480 --> 53:40.240\n with the Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian people\n\n53:40.240 --> 53:42.800\n that interact with the Russian soldiers,\n\n53:42.800 --> 53:46.400\n they reported that the Russian soldiers\n\n53:46.400 --> 53:51.400\n really believe they're saving the people of Ukraine\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:55.760\n in these local villages from the Nazis.\n\n53:55.760 --> 53:56.720\n I understand, yeah.\n\n53:56.720 --> 54:00.960\n So to them, it's not just that the Ukrainian government has\n\n54:00.960 --> 54:05.120\n or Ukraine has some Nazis, it's like it has been,\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:08.120\n the idea is that the Nazis have taken over Ukraine\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:09.920\n and we need to free them.\n\n54:09.920 --> 54:11.240\n This is the belief.\n\n54:11.240 --> 54:15.800\n So this, again, Nazi is still a dragon that lives.\n\n54:15.800 --> 54:16.640\n Yeah.\n\n54:16.640 --> 54:18.960\n And it's used by people because it's safe\n\n54:18.960 --> 54:20.400\n to sit next to that dragon\n\n54:20.400 --> 54:22.680\n and spread any kind of ideology you want.\n\n54:22.680 --> 54:27.200\n So I just wanted to kind of say that we have agreed\n\n54:27.200 --> 54:31.840\n on this particular dragon,\n\n54:31.840 --> 54:34.160\n but I still don't trust anybody who uses that one.\n\n54:34.160 --> 54:36.840\n Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries, right?\n\n54:36.840 --> 54:40.680\n No, no, it's, so this is a very complicated problem, right?\n\n54:40.680 --> 54:45.360\n So Rene Girard believed that it was a human proclivity\n\n54:45.360 --> 54:47.780\n to demonize a scapegoat and then drive it out\n\n54:47.780 --> 54:48.620\n of the village.\n\n54:48.620 --> 54:50.760\n And I've thought about that a lot.\n\n54:50.760 --> 54:52.460\n We need a place to put Satan.\n\n54:53.480 --> 54:55.880\n Seriously, this is a serious issue.\n\n54:55.880 --> 54:58.240\n Should he be inside the village or outside?\n\n54:58.240 --> 55:02.040\n Well, maybe he should be inside you, right?\n\n55:02.040 --> 55:05.680\n That's the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.\n\n55:05.680 --> 55:08.120\n It's like, Satan is best fought\n\n55:08.120 --> 55:10.960\n on the battleground of your soul.\n\n55:12.560 --> 55:15.180\n And that's, that's right.\n\n55:16.720 --> 55:17.640\n It's right.\n\n55:17.640 --> 55:19.680\n Can you actually put words to the kind of dragon\n\n55:19.680 --> 55:20.520\n that you're fighting?\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:22.440\n Is it communism?\n\n55:22.440 --> 55:24.240\n It's the spirit of Cain.\n\n55:24.240 --> 55:25.080\n Yeah.\n\n55:26.440 --> 55:30.700\n Can you elaborate what the spirit of Cain is?\n\n55:30.700 --> 55:35.700\n So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise\n\n55:36.160 --> 55:37.760\n for becoming self conscious,\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:40.180\n or when they become self conscious,\n\n55:40.180 --> 55:41.720\n they're destined to work.\n\n55:42.640 --> 55:44.560\n And the reason for that, as far as I can tell,\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:47.440\n is that to become self conscious\n\n55:47.440 --> 55:49.520\n is to become aware of the future.\n\n55:49.520 --> 55:51.120\n It's to become aware of death.\n\n55:51.120 --> 55:53.400\n That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story,\n\n55:53.400 --> 55:56.040\n to have the scales fall from your eyes.\n\n55:56.040 --> 55:58.320\n And then the consequence of that\n\n55:58.320 --> 56:01.400\n is that you now have to labor to prevent\n\n56:01.400 --> 56:03.500\n the catastrophes of the future.\n\n56:03.500 --> 56:04.600\n That's work.\n\n56:04.600 --> 56:06.440\n Work is sacrifice.\n\n56:06.440 --> 56:08.980\n Sacrifice of the present to the future.\n\n56:08.980 --> 56:12.200\n It's delay of gratification, it's maturity.\n\n56:12.200 --> 56:15.200\n It's sacrifice to something as well,\n\n56:15.200 --> 56:17.500\n and in the spirit of something.\n\n56:17.500 --> 56:22.500\n Okay, so now Adam and Eve have two children, Cain and Abel.\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:25.720\n So those are the first two people in history.\n\n56:25.720 --> 56:28.120\n Because the Garden of Eden doesn't count.\n\n56:28.120 --> 56:29.360\n And they're the first two people\n\n56:29.360 --> 56:31.000\n who are born rather than created.\n\n56:31.000 --> 56:32.680\n So they're the first two people.\n\n56:32.680 --> 56:33.800\n And that's a hell of a story,\n\n56:33.800 --> 56:36.720\n because it's a story of fratricidal murder\n\n56:36.720 --> 56:40.640\n that degenerates into genocide, flood, and tyranny.\n\n56:40.640 --> 56:45.640\n So that's fun for the opening salvo of the story, let's say.\n\n56:45.640 --> 56:48.720\n And Abel and Cain both make sacrifices.\n\n56:48.720 --> 56:52.260\n And for some reason, Abel's sacrifice is please God.\n\n56:52.260 --> 56:54.240\n It's not exactly clear why.\n\n56:54.240 --> 56:56.120\n And Cain's don't.\n\n56:56.120 --> 57:00.440\n Now, there's an implication in the text\n\n57:00.440 --> 57:03.480\n that it's because Cain's sacrifices are true,\n\n57:03.480 --> 57:05.000\n are second rate.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:07.900\n God says that Abel brings the finest\n\n57:07.900 --> 57:09.600\n to the sacrificial altar.\n\n57:09.600 --> 57:11.300\n He doesn't say that about Cain.\n\n57:11.300 --> 57:13.680\n So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away,\n\n57:13.680 --> 57:16.360\n but he's holding something in reserve.\n\n57:16.360 --> 57:19.780\n He's not all in, he's not bringing his best to the table.\n\n57:19.780 --> 57:22.120\n He's not offering his best to God.\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:25.620\n And so Abel thrives like mad.\n\n57:25.620 --> 57:26.680\n And everyone loves him.\n\n57:26.680 --> 57:28.720\n And he gets exactly what he needs and wants,\n\n57:28.720 --> 57:30.960\n exactly when he needs and wants it.\n\n57:30.960 --> 57:32.840\n He's favored of God.\n\n57:32.840 --> 57:36.160\n And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward\n\n57:36.160 --> 57:40.280\n and working, and his sacrifices are rejected.\n\n57:40.280 --> 57:45.280\n So he gets resentful, really resentful.\n\n57:45.480 --> 57:49.280\n Enough resentful enough to call God out\n\n57:49.280 --> 57:51.320\n and say something like,\n\n57:51.320 --> 57:55.680\n this is quite the creation you've got going here.\n\n57:55.680 --> 57:57.320\n I'm breaking myself in half\n\n57:57.320 --> 58:00.200\n and nothing good's coming my way.\n\n58:00.200 --> 58:01.520\n What the hell's up with that?\n\n58:01.520 --> 58:04.900\n And then there's Abel, the sun shining on him every day.\n\n58:04.900 --> 58:06.640\n How dare you?\n\n58:06.640 --> 58:07.920\n It's like, okay.\n\n58:07.920 --> 58:10.280\n But this is God that Cain's talking to.\n\n58:10.280 --> 58:14.640\n And so God says what Cain least wants to hear,\n\n58:14.640 --> 58:17.120\n which is what God usually says to people.\n\n58:17.120 --> 58:21.040\n He says, look to your own devices.\n\n58:21.040 --> 58:24.160\n You're not making the sacrifices you should.\n\n58:24.160 --> 58:25.420\n And you know it.\n\n58:25.420 --> 58:27.800\n And then he says something even worse.\n\n58:27.800 --> 58:31.840\n He says, sin crouches at your door\n\n58:31.840 --> 58:34.620\n like a sexually aroused predatory animal.\n\n58:35.600 --> 58:39.400\n And you've invited it in to have your way,\n\n58:39.400 --> 58:41.560\n to have its way with you.\n\n58:41.560 --> 58:42.920\n And so he basically says,\n\n58:42.920 --> 58:47.600\n you have allowed your resentment to preoccupy yourself.\n\n58:47.600 --> 58:49.400\n And now you're brooding upon it\n\n58:49.400 --> 58:52.880\n and generating something creative, new and awful,\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:55.140\n possessed by the spirit of resentment.\n\n58:56.240 --> 58:59.440\n And that's why you're in the miserable state you're in.\n\n58:59.440 --> 59:03.040\n So then Cain leaves, his countenance falls,\n\n59:03.040 --> 59:04.960\n as you might expect, and Cain leaves.\n\n59:04.960 --> 59:07.840\n And he's so incensed by this because God has said,\n\n59:07.840 --> 59:11.640\n look, your problems are of your own making.\n\n59:11.640 --> 59:13.720\n And not only that, you invited them in.\n\n59:13.720 --> 59:16.480\n And not only that, you engaged in this creatively.\n\n59:16.480 --> 59:18.720\n And not only that, you're blaming it on me.\n\n59:18.720 --> 59:21.160\n And not only that, that's making you jealous of Abel,\n\n59:21.160 --> 59:23.440\n who's your actual idol and goal.\n\n59:23.440 --> 59:28.440\n And Cain, instead of changing, kills Abel, right?\n\n59:29.480 --> 59:31.920\n And then Cain's descendants are the first people\n\n59:31.920 --> 59:34.220\n who make weapons of war.\n\n59:35.400 --> 59:39.320\n And so that's, okay, you wanna know what I think?\n\n59:39.320 --> 59:41.540\n That's the eternal story of mankind.\n\n59:42.480 --> 59:44.440\n And it's playing out right now,\n\n59:44.440 --> 59:47.000\n except at a thousand times the rate.\n\n59:47.000 --> 59:50.080\n Can I present to you a difficult truth?\n\n59:52.320 --> 59:56.180\n Perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have,\n\n59:56.180 --> 59:59.520\n that it is not always easy to know\n\n59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.880\n which among us are the Cain.\n\n1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:03.100\n That's for sure.\n\n1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:08.100\n And resentment, it is possible to imagine you\n\n1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:13.160\n as the person who has a resentment\n\n1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:18.160\n towards a particular worldview that you really worry about.\n\n1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:22.280\n Yeah, well, I talked to a good friend of mine last week\n\n1:00:22.280 --> 1:00:25.080\n about that publicly, we'll release it.\n\n1:00:25.080 --> 1:00:27.720\n So I said, well, do I have a particular animus\n\n1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:30.400\n against the left, let's say?\n\n1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.440\n It's like, well, probably.\n\n1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:33.440\n Okay, why?\n\n1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:38.440\n Well, first of all, I'm a university professor.\n\n1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:41.900\n It's not like the universities are threatened by the right.\n\n1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:45.160\n They're threatened by the left, 100%.\n\n1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:47.000\n And they're not just threatened a little bit,\n\n1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.660\n they're threatened a lot.\n\n1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:50.400\n And that threat made it impossible\n\n1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:53.080\n for me to continue in my profession the way I was.\n\n1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:55.560\n And it cost me my clinical practice too.\n\n1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.760\n And that's not over yet because I have 10 lawsuits\n\n1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:02.220\n against me out right now from the College of Psychologists\n\n1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:05.180\n because they've allowed anyone to complain about me\n\n1:01:05.180 --> 1:01:07.760\n anywhere in the world for any reason,\n\n1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:11.080\n and have the choice to follow that up with an investigation,\n\n1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:14.340\n which is a punishment in and of itself, and are doing so.\n\n1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:19.380\n And then I've been tortured nearly to death multiple times\n\n1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:21.500\n by bad actors on the left.\n\n1:01:21.500 --> 1:01:25.360\n Now I've had my fair share of radical right wingers\n\n1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:27.440\n being unhappy with what I've said,\n\n1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:32.040\n but personally, that's been the left the whole time.\n\n1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:35.660\n Not only me, but my family, put my family at risk\n\n1:01:35.660 --> 1:01:39.460\n in a big way and constantly, like not once or twice,\n\n1:01:39.460 --> 1:01:43.160\n because many people get canceled once or twice.\n\n1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:46.640\n But I've been canceled like 40 times.\n\n1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.680\n And I know like 200 people now who've been canceled.\n\n1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:53.160\n And I can tell you without doubt,\n\n1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:56.140\n that it is one of the worst experiences of their life.\n\n1:01:56.140 --> 1:01:58.920\n And that's if it only happens once.\n\n1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:03.920\n And so, and then I also know that the communists killed\n\n1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:07.080\n 100 million people in the 20th century,\n\n1:02:07.080 --> 1:02:10.820\n that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop\n\n1:02:10.820 --> 1:02:14.560\n and still haven't quit, that almost no one knows about it,\n\n1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:17.240\n and that the specter of resentful Marxism\n\n1:02:17.240 --> 1:02:19.000\n is back in full force.\n\n1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.120\n And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?\n\n1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:22.960\n Yes.\n\n1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:24.320\n Does it go too far?\n\n1:02:26.400 --> 1:02:27.400\n I don't know.\n\n1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:28.780\n I'm trying to figure that out.\n\n1:02:28.780 --> 1:02:33.580\n The story you just told, it seems nearly impossible\n\n1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:35.880\n for you, an intellectual powerhouse,\n\n1:02:35.880 --> 1:02:38.480\n not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.\n\n1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:39.320\n Well.\n\n1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.200\n And this is the, so let me challenge you.\n\n1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:42.040\n Yeah, go right ahead, man.\n\n1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:43.640\n Let me challenge you.\n\n1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:48.640\n Can you steal, man, the case that the prime minister\n\n1:02:50.320 --> 1:02:55.320\n of this country, Trudeau, wants the best for this country\n\n1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:58.840\n and actually might do good things for this country\n\n1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:00.440\n as an intellectual challenge?\n\n1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:01.280\n Sure.\n\n1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.400\n He seems to get along well with his wife.\n\n1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:07.040\n He has some kids.\n\n1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:08.680\n There's no sexual scandals.\n\n1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.760\n And he's in a position where that could easily be the case.\n\n1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:13.400\n He seems to have done some good things\n\n1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:15.720\n on the oceanic management front.\n\n1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:18.040\n He's put a fair bit of Canada's oceans\n\n1:03:18.040 --> 1:03:19.440\n into marine protected areas,\n\n1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:23.280\n and that might be his most fundamental legacy, if it's real.\n\n1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:24.620\n I've been trying to get information\n\n1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:27.240\n about the actual reality of the protection,\n\n1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:29.080\n and I haven't been able to do that.\n\n1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:30.200\n But that's a good thing.\n\n1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.600\n So sorry, the family thing is, there's some aspect of.\n\n1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:33.840\n It speaks to his character.\n\n1:03:33.840 --> 1:03:34.680\n This is a character.\n\n1:03:34.680 --> 1:03:38.240\n There is some aspect to him that makes him a good man\n\n1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.080\n in that sense.\n\n1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:41.160\n There's the evidence there.\n\n1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:44.540\n He's not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate on the sexual front,\n\n1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:45.400\n so that's something.\n\n1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.920\n And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage,\n\n1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:51.900\n and he has kids, so good for him.\n\n1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:54.160\n That's a good start, by the way, for a leader.\n\n1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:55.000\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:55.840\n To be a good man.\n\n1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:57.400\n Well, then I also thought, okay,\n\n1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:00.040\n well, after the Liberals had brought in\n\n1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:02.760\n a Harvard intellectual who was a Canadian\n\n1:04:02.760 --> 1:04:06.120\n to be their last leader, he didn't work out,\n\n1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:08.340\n and then they're flailing about for a leader,\n\n1:04:08.340 --> 1:04:10.040\n and the Liberals in Canada are pretty good\n\n1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:14.880\n at maintaining power and leadership,\n\n1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.120\n and have been the dominant governing party in Canada\n\n1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.600\n for a long time.\n\n1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:21.960\n And so they went to Justin and said,\n\n1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:24.680\n well, you know, it's you or a Conservative,\n\n1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:28.760\n and you can imagine that's not a positive specter\n\n1:04:28.760 --> 1:04:32.120\n for someone who's on the left, or even a Liberal,\n\n1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:35.040\n especially, and Trudeau's quite a bit on the left.\n\n1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:37.360\n And they said, we need you to run.\n\n1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.760\n And then I thought, okay, well,\n\n1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:41.720\n the answer to that should have been no,\n\n1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:45.800\n because Trudeau, Justin, has no training for this,\n\n1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:46.640\n no experience.\n\n1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:50.200\n He's not, he's a part time drama teacher, fundamentally.\n\n1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:51.320\n He hadn't run a business.\n\n1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:54.180\n He just didn't know enough to be Prime Minister.\n\n1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:56.540\n But then I'm trying to put myself in his position, eh?\n\n1:04:56.540 --> 1:04:59.880\n So it's like, okay, I don't know enough, but I'm young,\n\n1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:01.840\n and we don't want the Conservatives,\n\n1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:03.520\n and they had had a run, a 10 year run,\n\n1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:05.320\n so maybe it was time for a new government.\n\n1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.560\n I could, maybe I could grow into this man.\n\n1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:10.940\n Maybe I could surround myself with good people,\n\n1:05:10.940 --> 1:05:14.200\n and I could learn humbly, and I could become\n\n1:05:16.200 --> 1:05:17.960\n the person I'm now pretending to be,\n\n1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:20.680\n which we all have to do as we move forward, right?\n\n1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:23.460\n And so then I thought, okay,\n\n1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:24.920\n I think you made a mistake there,\n\n1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:28.120\n because you ran only on your father's name,\n\n1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:29.660\n and you didn't have the background,\n\n1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:31.160\n but let's give the devil his due,\n\n1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:33.280\n and say that's no problem.\n\n1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:35.000\n Okay, so now what do you do?\n\n1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.880\n Well, you get elected, and your first act is\n\n1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:42.520\n to make the cabinet 50% women,\n\n1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.120\n despite the fact that only 25% of the elected members\n\n1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:47.120\n are female.\n\n1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:49.480\n It's like, okay, you just have your talent pool.\n\n1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:53.040\n That was a really bad move for your first move.\n\n1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:55.080\n Can I ask you about that?\n\n1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:58.840\n Do you think, where does that move come from?\n\n1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:00.520\n Deep somewhere in the heart?\n\n1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:05.520\n Or is it trying to listen to the social forces\n\n1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:09.960\n of the moment, and try to ride those ways towards\n\n1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:12.220\n maybe greater and greater popularity?\n\n1:06:12.220 --> 1:06:14.000\n By after thinking it through.\n\n1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.860\n It's like, no, you just have your talent pool\n\n1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:18.140\n for cabinet positions.\n\n1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:19.160\n That's what you did.\n\n1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:20.860\n There's enough cabinet positions.\n\n1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:24.320\n You know, you could argue that each of them met threshold.\n\n1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.080\n It's like, there's a big difference\n\n1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:27.960\n between threshold and excellent.\n\n1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:31.040\n So you don't think that came from a place of compassion?\n\n1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:31.880\n I don't care if it did.\n\n1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:34.160\n I don't regard compassion as a virtue.\n\n1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:36.400\n Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.\n\n1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:37.240\n You don't think?\n\n1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.280\n Judicious compassion is a virtue.\n\n1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:40.800\n Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:44.640\n Compassion can come deep from the human heart\n\n1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:46.160\n and the human mind, I think.\n\n1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.420\n Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?\n\n1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:49.260\n Yes.\n\n1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:50.080\n Trying to understand the suffering in the world.\n\n1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:53.000\n Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.\n\n1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:53.840\n I see.\n\n1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:58.080\n Well, compassion isn't treating adults like infants.\n\n1:06:58.080 --> 1:06:59.560\n I mean, those are just terms.\n\n1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:01.120\n Are you sure?\n\n1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:03.640\n Whatever the term is, maybe love is maybe the better word.\n\n1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:05.540\n Edible compassion is.\n\n1:07:05.540 --> 1:07:08.540\n I mean, I suppose I'm speaking to love.\n\n1:07:08.540 --> 1:07:11.840\n You don't think those ideas came from concern?\n\n1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:16.840\n Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.\n\n1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.520\n Love is complicated, man.\n\n1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.160\n Yeah, it has a lot of good things in it, yes.\n\n1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:24.000\n If I love you, is it compassion\n\n1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:25.640\n or encouragement you want from me?\n\n1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:27.480\n Yeah, the dance.\n\n1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:30.640\n Love is definitely a dance of two humans, ultimately,\n\n1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.160\n that leads to the growth of both, yes.\n\n1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:33.000\n Well, that's the thing.\n\n1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:34.740\n The growth element is crucial.\n\n1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:38.560\n Because the growth element, to foster the growth element,\n\n1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.080\n that requires judgment.\n\n1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:43.840\n Compassion and judgment, well, even,\n\n1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:45.880\n and have been conceptualized this way forever,\n\n1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:48.740\n two hands of God, mercy and justice.\n\n1:07:48.740 --> 1:07:50.880\n They have to operate in tandem, right?\n\n1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:55.880\n And mercy is flawed as you are, you're acceptable.\n\n1:07:58.040 --> 1:07:59.480\n It's like, well, do you want that?\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:02.060\n Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?\n\n1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:03.320\n And the answer to that is no.\n\n1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.240\n It's like, well, that's where the judgment comes in.\n\n1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.440\n It's like, but you could be better.\n\n1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:09.280\n You could be more than you are.\n\n1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.000\n And that's the maternal and the paternal\n\n1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.880\n in some fundamental sense.\n\n1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:17.880\n And there has to be a active exchange of information\n\n1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.280\n between those two poles.\n\n1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:23.280\n So even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion,\n\n1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:27.620\n and it's like, yeah, just how loving are you, first of all?\n\n1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:29.080\n No, it was a really bad decision.\n\n1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:32.920\n And then he's expressed contempt for monetary policy.\n\n1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:34.560\n I'm not interested in monetary policy.\n\n1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:39.560\n It's like, okay, but you're a prime minister.\n\n1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:41.800\n And he's expressed admiration\n\n1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:43.920\n for the Chinese Communist Party,\n\n1:08:43.920 --> 1:08:46.200\n because they can be very efficient\n\n1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:48.160\n in their pursuit of environmental goals.\n\n1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.580\n It's like, oh yeah, efficiency, eh?\n\n1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:56.140\n The efficiency of the tyranny in the service of your terror.\n\n1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:59.240\n And so, and I've watched him repeatedly\n\n1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:00.700\n and I've listened to him a lot.\n\n1:09:00.700 --> 1:09:03.040\n And I've tried to do that clinically\n\n1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:05.760\n and with some degree of dispassion.\n\n1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:09.800\n And that's hard too, because his father, Pierre,\n\n1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:14.800\n devastated the West in 1982 with the national energy policy.\n\n1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:18.140\n And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.\n\n1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:20.240\n And so as a westerner as well,\n\n1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:24.680\n I have an inbuilt animus and one that's well deserved,\n\n1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:26.600\n because central Canada,\n\n1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:30.320\n especially the glittery literati elite types\n\n1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:34.480\n in the Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto triangle\n\n1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:39.480\n have exploited the West and expressed contempt for the West\n\n1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.960\n far too much for far too long.\n\n1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:45.360\n And that's accelerating at the moment, for example,\n\n1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.840\n with Trudeau's recent attack on the Canadian farmers.\n\n1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:52.520\n He's an enemy of the oil and gas industry.\n\n1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:54.840\n It's an utter and absolute bloody catastrophe.\n\n1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:56.720\n And look what's happened in Europe,\n\n1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.720\n at least in partial consequence.\n\n1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.000\n And he's no friend to the farmers.\n\n1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:04.160\n So I've tried to steel man him.\n\n1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:06.620\n I try to put myself in the position of the people\n\n1:10:06.620 --> 1:10:08.340\n that I'm criticizing.\n\n1:10:08.340 --> 1:10:09.940\n I think he's a narcissist.\n\n1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.320\n Do you think there's a degree to which power changed him?\n\n1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:17.380\n If you're not suited for the position,\n\n1:10:17.380 --> 1:10:18.780\n if you're not the man for the position,\n\n1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:21.720\n you can be absolutely 100% sure\n\n1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:23.060\n that the power will corrupt you.\n\n1:10:23.060 --> 1:10:24.940\n How could it not?\n\n1:10:24.940 --> 1:10:27.740\n I mean, at the least, if you don't have the chops\n\n1:10:27.740 --> 1:10:30.780\n for the job, you have to devalue the job\n\n1:10:30.780 --> 1:10:34.040\n to the point where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.\n\n1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:37.900\n So yes, I think that it's corrupted him.\n\n1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:39.980\n And I mean, look at him doubling down.\n\n1:10:39.980 --> 1:10:43.380\n We wear masks in flights into Canada.\n\n1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:46.300\n We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form\n\n1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:49.180\n on our phones because a passport isn't good enough.\n\n1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:50.700\n We can't get a passport.\n\n1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:53.380\n What if you're 85 and you don't know\n\n1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:54.960\n how to use a smartphone?\n\n1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:58.100\n Oh, well, too bad for you.\n\n1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:01.140\n It's like, yes, it's corrupted him.\n\n1:11:01.140 --> 1:11:04.220\n Would you talk to him?\n\n1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:05.980\n If you were to sit down and talk with him\n\n1:11:05.980 --> 1:11:07.620\n and he wanted to talk,\n\n1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:12.620\n would you and what kind of things would you talk about,\n\n1:11:13.460 --> 1:11:14.820\n perhaps on your podcast?\n\n1:11:14.820 --> 1:11:17.820\n I don't think I've ever said no to talking to anyone.\n\n1:11:18.740 --> 1:11:20.020\n So, which is, you know.\n\n1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:22.060\n Would you, would that be a first\n\n1:11:22.060 --> 1:11:24.360\n or would you make that conversation?\n\n1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.300\n Do you believe in the power of those kinds of contexts?\n\n1:11:27.300 --> 1:11:30.040\n No, if he was willing to talk to me,\n\n1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:31.720\n I'd talk because I'd like to ask him.\n\n1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:33.480\n I have lots of things I'd like to ask him about.\n\n1:11:33.480 --> 1:11:35.380\n I mean, I've had political types in Canada\n\n1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:37.820\n on my podcast and tried to ask them questions.\n\n1:11:39.060 --> 1:11:40.460\n So, I'd like to know.\n\n1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:44.780\n You know, maybe I've got a big part of him wrong.\n\n1:11:44.780 --> 1:11:49.420\n And I probably do, but my observation has been\n\n1:11:49.420 --> 1:11:51.660\n that every chance he had to retreat\n\n1:11:51.660 --> 1:11:55.460\n from his pharaonic position, let's say, he doubled down.\n\n1:11:55.460 --> 1:12:00.220\n And these, our parliament is not running for the next year.\n\n1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:03.660\n It's still zoom in.\n\n1:12:03.660 --> 1:12:06.180\n It's still COVID lockdown parliament.\n\n1:12:06.180 --> 1:12:11.180\n For the next year, it's already been fatally compromised,\n\n1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:16.860\n perhaps, by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.\n\n1:12:16.900 --> 1:12:19.060\n And this is parliament we're talking about.\n\n1:12:19.060 --> 1:12:24.060\n Yeah, there's a kind of paralysis, fear driven paralysis\n\n1:12:24.700 --> 1:12:27.820\n that also, in part, some of the most brilliant people\n\n1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:29.940\n I know are lost in this paralysis.\n\n1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:32.380\n I don't think people have signed a word to it,\n\n1:12:32.380 --> 1:12:35.500\n but it's almost like a fear of this unknown thing\n\n1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:36.940\n that lurks in the shadows.\n\n1:12:36.940 --> 1:12:41.660\n And that, unfortunately, that fear is leveraged by people\n\n1:12:44.100 --> 1:12:47.140\n that, you know, who are in academic circles,\n\n1:12:47.140 --> 1:12:48.460\n who are in faculty or students,\n\n1:12:48.460 --> 1:12:50.380\n and so on, or more in administration.\n\n1:12:50.380 --> 1:12:52.540\n And they start to use that fear,\n\n1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:55.300\n which makes me quite uncomfortable.\n\n1:12:55.300 --> 1:13:00.060\n It does lend people in the positions of power\n\n1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:02.100\n who are not good at handling that power\n\n1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:07.100\n to become slowly, day by day, a little bit more corrupt.\n\n1:13:07.340 --> 1:13:09.060\n I was really trying to figure out, you know,\n\n1:13:09.060 --> 1:13:10.660\n the last two weeks, thinking this through.\n\n1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:12.060\n It's like, how do you know?\n\n1:13:13.340 --> 1:13:15.020\n Let's say someone asked me a question\n\n1:13:15.020 --> 1:13:16.740\n in the YouTube comments, said,\n\n1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:21.100\n why can I trust your advice on the environmental front?\n\n1:13:22.340 --> 1:13:24.620\n And I thought, that's a really good question.\n\n1:13:25.580 --> 1:13:29.260\n Okay, let's see if we can figure out the principles\n\n1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:31.220\n by which the advice would be trustworthy.\n\n1:13:31.220 --> 1:13:34.500\n Okay, how do you know it's not trustworthy?\n\n1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:39.500\n Well, one potential response to that would be\n\n1:13:40.460 --> 1:13:43.100\n the claims are not in accordance with the facts,\n\n1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:44.820\n but, you know, facts are tricky things\n\n1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:46.380\n and it depends on where you look for them.\n\n1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:49.660\n So that's a tough one to get right because,\n\n1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:51.900\n for example, Lomberg's fundamental critics\n\n1:13:51.900 --> 1:13:56.100\n argue about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.\n\n1:13:56.100 --> 1:13:57.980\n So that can't be an unerring guide.\n\n1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:01.740\n And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn't work\n\n1:14:01.740 --> 1:14:05.260\n because when it's about everything, there's too many facts.\n\n1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:08.820\n So then how do you determine if someone's a trustworthy guide\n\n1:14:08.820 --> 1:14:11.420\n in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?\n\n1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:13.380\n Because that's really the question.\n\n1:14:13.380 --> 1:14:17.380\n And the answer is they're not terrified tyrants.\n\n1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:20.540\n I think that's the answer.\n\n1:14:20.540 --> 1:14:21.500\n Now, maybe that's wrong.\n\n1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:22.940\n If someone has a better answer.\n\n1:14:22.940 --> 1:14:24.900\n How do you know if they're a terrified tyrant?\n\n1:14:24.900 --> 1:14:27.900\n Because they are willing to use compulsion on other people.\n\n1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:29.900\n When they could use goodwill.\n\n1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.780\n Like the farmers in Canada objected.\n\n1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:36.700\n They said, look, we have every economic reason\n\n1:14:36.700 --> 1:14:39.180\n to use as little fertilizer as we can.\n\n1:14:39.180 --> 1:14:40.780\n Cause it's expensive.\n\n1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:44.900\n We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.\n\n1:14:44.900 --> 1:14:48.020\n We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially\n\n1:14:48.020 --> 1:14:50.100\n in the last 40 years, you can't believe it.\n\n1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:52.260\n And we grow way more food.\n\n1:14:52.260 --> 1:14:54.820\n We're already breaking ourselves in half.\n\n1:14:54.820 --> 1:14:56.180\n And if you know farmers,\n\n1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:57.900\n especially the ones who still survive,\n\n1:14:57.900 --> 1:15:00.540\n you think those people don't know what they're doing.\n\n1:15:00.540 --> 1:15:04.500\n It's like, yeah, they're pretty damn sophisticated man.\n\n1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:08.780\n Like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.\n\n1:15:08.780 --> 1:15:11.860\n And now you tell them, no, it's a 30% reduction.\n\n1:15:11.860 --> 1:15:13.700\n And we don't care how much food you're growing.\n\n1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:18.220\n So it's not a reduction that's dependent\n\n1:15:18.220 --> 1:15:21.740\n on amount of food produced per unit of fertilizer used,\n\n1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.500\n which would be at least you could imagine it.\n\n1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:27.180\n So, okay, so you're producing this much food\n\n1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:28.740\n and you use this much fertilizer.\n\n1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:30.660\n So you're hyper efficient.\n\n1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:32.340\n Maybe we take the 10% of farmers\n\n1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:35.060\n who are the least efficient in that metric.\n\n1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:36.140\n And we say to them,\n\n1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:38.740\n you have to get as efficient as the average farmer.\n\n1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.220\n And then they say, well, look, you know,\n\n1:15:41.220 --> 1:15:42.780\n our situation's different.\n\n1:15:42.780 --> 1:15:46.100\n We're in a more Northern climb, the soil's weaker.\n\n1:15:46.100 --> 1:15:48.100\n You know, you obviously have to bargain with that,\n\n1:15:48.100 --> 1:15:52.100\n but at least you reward them for their productivity.\n\n1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:55.220\n Well, it's like, well, Holland isn't gonna have beef.\n\n1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:56.940\n Well, where are they gonna get it?\n\n1:15:56.940 --> 1:15:58.140\n Well, you don't need it.\n\n1:15:58.140 --> 1:15:58.980\n It's like, oh, I see.\n\n1:15:58.980 --> 1:16:01.340\n You get to tell me what I can eat now, do you?\n\n1:16:01.340 --> 1:16:02.340\n Really?\n\n1:16:02.340 --> 1:16:03.180\n Okay.\n\n1:16:03.180 --> 1:16:07.660\n And Holland is gonna import food from where\n\n1:16:07.660 --> 1:16:11.340\n that's more efficient on the fertilizer front.\n\n1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:13.460\n There's no one more efficient than Holland.\n\n1:16:13.460 --> 1:16:15.260\n And same with Canada.\n\n1:16:15.260 --> 1:16:19.220\n And like, isn't this gonna make food prices more expensive?\n\n1:16:19.220 --> 1:16:23.020\n And doesn't that mean that hungry people die?\n\n1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:24.700\n Cause that is what it means.\n\n1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:25.540\n And so.\n\n1:16:25.540 --> 1:16:27.700\n Ultimately, poor people pay the price\n\n1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:29.700\n of these kinds of policies.\n\n1:16:29.700 --> 1:16:31.820\n Not known, not ultimately.\n\n1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:34.540\n Now.\n\n1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:35.380\n Today.\n\n1:16:35.380 --> 1:16:36.220\n Today.\n\n1:16:36.220 --> 1:16:37.660\n That's a crucial distinction because they say,\n\n1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:39.660\n well, ultimately the poor will benefit.\n\n1:16:40.980 --> 1:16:42.300\n Yeah, except the dead ones.\n\n1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:43.140\n Yes.\n\n1:16:43.140 --> 1:16:43.980\n Today.\n\n1:16:43.980 --> 1:16:45.340\n Today, right.\n\n1:16:45.340 --> 1:16:48.380\n It seems like the story of war to,\n\n1:16:48.380 --> 1:16:52.620\n is a time when the poor people suffer\n\n1:16:52.620 --> 1:16:56.540\n from the decision made by the powerful, the rich,\n\n1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:59.700\n the political elite.\n\n1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:00.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:00.980 --> 1:17:03.340\n Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.\n\n1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:04.180\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:17:04.180 --> 1:17:06.220\n I got into plenty of trouble about that too.\n\n1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:12.220\n You're, you're just a man in a suit\n\n1:17:12.220 --> 1:17:16.700\n talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.\n\n1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:20.740\n There's also people dying, fighting.\n\n1:17:20.740 --> 1:17:23.700\n It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.\n\n1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:26.420\n This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.\n\n1:17:26.420 --> 1:17:30.180\n It's people trying to ask, they have many dragons\n\n1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:32.500\n and they're asking themselves a question,\n\n1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:33.660\n who are we?\n\n1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:35.100\n What is this?\n\n1:17:35.100 --> 1:17:37.340\n What is the future of this nation?\n\n1:17:37.340 --> 1:17:41.180\n We thought we are a great nation.\n\n1:17:41.180 --> 1:17:44.180\n And I think both countries say this.\n\n1:17:44.180 --> 1:17:48.940\n And they say, well, how do we become the great nation\n\n1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:50.060\n we thought we are?\n\n1:17:50.060 --> 1:17:50.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:55.140\n And so what, first of all, you got in trouble.\n\n1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:58.540\n What's the dynamics of the trouble?\n\n1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:01.740\n And is there something you regret saying?\n\n1:18:01.740 --> 1:18:03.660\n No, no, I thought about it a lot.\n\n1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:06.140\n I laid out four reasons for the war.\n\n1:18:06.140 --> 1:18:08.820\n And then I was criticized in the Atlantic\n\n1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:12.020\n for the argument was reduced to one reason,\n\n1:18:12.020 --> 1:18:15.220\n which was a caricature of the reason.\n\n1:18:15.220 --> 1:18:18.220\n I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.\n\n1:18:18.220 --> 1:18:21.660\n Mismanagement on the part of the West in relationship\n\n1:18:21.660 --> 1:18:24.420\n to Russia and foreign policy over the last,\n\n1:18:24.420 --> 1:18:26.580\n since the wall fell.\n\n1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:30.180\n It's understandable because it's extremely complex.\n\n1:18:30.180 --> 1:18:34.500\n Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy\n\n1:18:34.500 --> 1:18:37.940\n provision for Europe in the wake of idiot environmental\n\n1:18:37.940 --> 1:18:41.740\n globalist utopianism.\n\n1:18:41.740 --> 1:18:46.900\n The expansionist tendencies of Russia\n\n1:18:46.900 --> 1:18:50.300\n that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet Union empire\n\n1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:51.180\n building.\n\n1:18:51.180 --> 1:18:53.940\n And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for,\n\n1:18:53.940 --> 1:18:58.540\n which is Putin's belief or willingness\n\n1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:01.180\n to manipulate his people into believing\n\n1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:04.500\n that Russia is a salvific force in the face\n\n1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:06.820\n of idiot Western wokeism.\n\n1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:08.420\n And that's the one I got in trouble for.\n\n1:19:08.420 --> 1:19:10.180\n It's like, while you're justifying Putin,\n\n1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:14.860\n it's like, it's not only the Russians\n\n1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:17.260\n that think the West has lost its mind.\n\n1:19:17.260 --> 1:19:19.340\n The Eastern Europeans think so too.\n\n1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:20.260\n And do I know that?\n\n1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:24.700\n It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries\n\n1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:26.820\n this spring.\n\n1:19:26.820 --> 1:19:29.900\n And I talked to 300 political and cultural leaders.\n\n1:19:29.900 --> 1:19:32.100\n And you might say, well, they were all conservatives.\n\n1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:35.460\n It's like, actually, no, they weren't.\n\n1:19:35.460 --> 1:19:37.220\n Most of them were conservatives.\n\n1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:38.140\n Because it turns out that they're\n\n1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:39.220\n more willing to talk to me.\n\n1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:42.300\n But a good chunk of them were liberals\n\n1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:46.140\n by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:49.860\n And a fair number of them were canceled progressives.\n\n1:19:49.860 --> 1:19:51.940\n Well, because you're very concerned\n\n1:19:51.940 --> 1:19:55.980\n about the culture wars that perhaps\n\n1:19:55.980 --> 1:20:02.500\n are a signal of a possible bad future for this country\n\n1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:06.340\n and for this part of the world, that reason stands out.\n\n1:20:06.340 --> 1:20:13.380\n And do you, sort of looking back at four reasons,\n\n1:20:13.380 --> 1:20:16.300\n think it deserves to have a place in one of the four?\n\n1:20:16.300 --> 1:20:17.740\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n1:20:17.740 --> 1:20:20.460\n Because it is, you know.\n\n1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:22.180\n Well, the four was bifurcated.\n\n1:20:22.180 --> 1:20:24.300\n Because I said, look, Putin might believe this.\n\n1:20:24.300 --> 1:20:25.780\n And I actually think he does.\n\n1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.500\n Because I read a bunch of Putin speeches.\n\n1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:29.820\n And I have been reading them for 15 years.\n\n1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:31.460\n And my sense of people generally,\n\n1:20:31.460 --> 1:20:33.660\n and this was true of Hitler, it's like,\n\n1:20:33.660 --> 1:20:35.620\n what did Hitler believe?\n\n1:20:35.620 --> 1:20:37.900\n Well, did you read what he wrote?\n\n1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:40.020\n He just did what he said he was going to do.\n\n1:20:40.020 --> 1:20:42.380\n And you might think, well, some people are so tricky,\n\n1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:47.140\n they have a whole body of elaborated speech\n\n1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:49.940\n that's completely separate from their personality.\n\n1:20:49.940 --> 1:20:52.860\n And their personality is pursuing a different agenda.\n\n1:20:52.860 --> 1:20:57.180\n And this whole body of speech is nothing but affront.\n\n1:20:57.180 --> 1:21:00.060\n It's like, good luck finding someone that sophisticated.\n\n1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:01.940\n First of all, if you say things long enough,\n\n1:21:01.940 --> 1:21:02.900\n you're going to believe them.\n\n1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:05.260\n That's a really interesting and fascinating and important\n\n1:21:05.260 --> 1:21:05.900\n point.\n\n1:21:05.900 --> 1:21:09.580\n Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda,\n\n1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:12.620\n I think Hitler is an example of somebody\n\n1:21:12.620 --> 1:21:14.380\n that I think really quickly you start\n\n1:21:14.380 --> 1:21:16.100\n to believe the propaganda.\n\n1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:19.260\n Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.\n\n1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:22.740\n It's like, don't you become what you practice?\n\n1:21:22.740 --> 1:21:24.860\n And the answer to that is, well, absolutely.\n\n1:21:24.860 --> 1:21:26.380\n We even know the neurology.\n\n1:21:26.380 --> 1:21:28.420\n It's like when you first formulate a concept,\n\n1:21:28.420 --> 1:21:32.100\n huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.\n\n1:21:32.100 --> 1:21:34.820\n But as you practice that, first of all,\n\n1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:36.740\n the right hemisphere stops participating.\n\n1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:40.660\n And then the left participates less and less\n\n1:21:40.660 --> 1:21:43.820\n until you build specialized machinery for exactly\n\n1:21:43.820 --> 1:21:45.780\n that conceptual frame.\n\n1:21:45.780 --> 1:21:49.060\n And then you start to see it, not just think it.\n\n1:21:49.060 --> 1:21:52.300\n And so if you're telling the same lies over and over,\n\n1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:53.620\n who do you think you're fooling?\n\n1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:56.420\n Think, well, I can withstand my own lies,\n\n1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:58.340\n not if they're effective lies.\n\n1:21:58.340 --> 1:22:02.300\n And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people,\n\n1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:04.380\n and then they reflect them back to you,\n\n1:22:04.380 --> 1:22:06.180\n what makes you think you're going\n\n1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:08.140\n to be able to withstand that?\n\n1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:08.940\n You aren't.\n\n1:22:08.940 --> 1:22:12.660\n And so I do think Putin believes, to the degree\n\n1:22:12.660 --> 1:22:15.300\n that he believes anything, I do believe\n\n1:22:15.300 --> 1:22:20.620\n that he thinks of himself as a bulwark for Christendom\n\n1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:23.540\n against the degeneration of the West.\n\n1:22:23.540 --> 1:22:26.620\n And that's that third way that Dugin and Putin\n\n1:22:26.620 --> 1:22:29.340\n have been talking about, the philosopher Alexander Dugin\n\n1:22:29.340 --> 1:22:31.060\n and Putin for 15 years.\n\n1:22:31.060 --> 1:22:34.580\n Now, what that is is very amorphous.\n\n1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.580\n Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians\n\n1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:40.900\n would have to return to the incremental development\n\n1:22:40.900 --> 1:22:44.940\n of Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.\n\n1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:46.860\n And to some degree, that's happened in Russia\n\n1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.420\n because there's been a return to Orthodox Christianity.\n\n1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:51.780\n Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox church\n\n1:22:51.780 --> 1:22:53.900\n has just been coopted by the state.\n\n1:22:53.900 --> 1:22:55.980\n And I would say there's some evidence for that.\n\n1:22:55.980 --> 1:23:01.020\n I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns,\n\n1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:03.180\n now I don't know if this is true,\n\n1:23:03.180 --> 1:23:06.300\n owns $5 billion worth of personal property.\n\n1:23:06.300 --> 1:23:09.060\n And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.\n\n1:23:09.060 --> 1:23:11.660\n And it's possible that the Orthodox church\n\n1:23:11.660 --> 1:23:12.860\n has been coopted.\n\n1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:16.420\n But there has been somewhat of an Orthodox revival in Russia.\n\n1:23:16.420 --> 1:23:18.580\n And I don't think that's all bad.\n\n1:23:18.580 --> 1:23:21.500\n Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this,\n\n1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:24.180\n if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,\n\n1:23:24.180 --> 1:23:29.220\n and unfortunately, I don't think that's true.\n\n1:23:29.220 --> 1:23:30.620\n I've read his speeches.\n\n1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:32.460\n It doesn't look like it to me.\n\n1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:34.740\n And he is by no means the worst Russian leader\n\n1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:37.220\n of the last 100 years.\n\n1:23:37.220 --> 1:23:39.340\n Well, there's quite a selection there.\n\n1:23:39.340 --> 1:23:41.500\n There certainly is.\n\n1:23:41.500 --> 1:23:45.380\n And I say that knowing that.\n\n1:23:45.380 --> 1:23:49.860\n Even if he doesn't believe it, he's convinced his people\n\n1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:51.500\n that it's true.\n\n1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:57.260\n And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.\n\n1:23:57.260 --> 1:23:59.860\n And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.\n\n1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:05.740\n Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.\n\n1:24:05.740 --> 1:24:09.260\n And a lot of people have reached out to me, experts,\n\n1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:12.020\n telling me how I should feel, what\n\n1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:14.060\n I should think about Ukraine.\n\n1:24:14.060 --> 1:24:18.340\n Oh, you naive Lex, you're so naive.\n\n1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:20.340\n Here's how it really is.\n\n1:24:20.340 --> 1:24:24.140\n But then I get to see people that lost their home.\n\n1:24:24.140 --> 1:24:27.300\n I get to see people on the Russian side who believe\n\n1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:31.420\n they're, I genuinely think that there's some degree to which\n\n1:24:31.420 --> 1:24:33.500\n they have love in their heart.\n\n1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:38.860\n They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.\n\n1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:41.420\n How else would you motivate young men to go fight?\n\n1:24:41.420 --> 1:24:47.540\n It's just, it's these humans destroying not only their homes,\n\n1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:50.020\n but creating generational hate, destroying\n\n1:24:50.020 --> 1:24:52.780\n the possibility of love towards each other.\n\n1:24:52.780 --> 1:24:54.700\n They're basically creating hate.\n\n1:24:54.700 --> 1:24:59.540\n What I've heard a lot of is on February 24 of this year,\n\n1:24:59.540 --> 1:25:04.260\n hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.\n\n1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:07.820\n Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not\n\n1:25:07.820 --> 1:25:12.980\n the soldiers in Russia, but hate towards all Russians.\n\n1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:15.460\n Hate that will last generations.\n\n1:25:15.460 --> 1:25:23.940\n And then you can see just the pain there.\n\n1:25:23.940 --> 1:25:32.340\n And then when all these experts talk about agriculture,\n\n1:25:32.340 --> 1:25:35.660\n and energy, and geopolitics, and yeah,\n\n1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:39.180\n maybe like what you say with fighting\n\n1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:41.340\n the ideologies of the woke and so on,\n\n1:25:41.340 --> 1:25:45.660\n I just feel like it's missing something deep,\n\n1:25:45.660 --> 1:25:52.500\n that war is not fought about any of those things.\n\n1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:56.900\n War is started, and war is averted based on human beings,\n\n1:25:56.900 --> 1:25:58.860\n based on humanity.\n\n1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:01.260\n Here's another ugly thought, since we\n\n1:26:01.260 --> 1:26:02.580\n haven't had enough so far.\n\n1:26:05.940 --> 1:26:08.780\n We locked everything down for COVID.\n\n1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:10.380\n How much face to face communication\n\n1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:12.940\n was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?\n\n1:26:12.940 --> 1:26:14.420\n How about none?\n\n1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.940\n How about that was the wrong amount,\n\n1:26:16.940 --> 1:26:19.820\n especially given that Europe was completely dependent on Putin\n\n1:26:19.820 --> 1:26:21.060\n for its energy supplies?\n\n1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:23.460\n Well, not completely, but you know what I mean.\n\n1:26:23.460 --> 1:26:26.020\n Materially and significantly.\n\n1:26:26.020 --> 1:26:28.620\n Maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.\n\n1:26:28.620 --> 1:26:30.780\n Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble.\n\n1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:31.660\n Probably.\n\n1:26:31.660 --> 1:26:34.260\n And not just an information bubble,\n\n1:26:34.260 --> 1:26:36.260\n how all these experts tell me about.\n\n1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:39.140\n Yeah, no, a human bubble.\n\n1:26:39.140 --> 1:26:41.220\n Look, one of the things I've really learned,\n\n1:26:41.220 --> 1:26:43.180\n there's a real emphasis on hospitality\n\n1:26:43.180 --> 1:26:45.220\n in the Old Testament.\n\n1:26:45.220 --> 1:26:46.940\n I just brought all these scholars together\n\n1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:48.060\n to talk about Exodus.\n\n1:26:48.060 --> 1:26:50.780\n Hey, I have this security team with me,\n\n1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:53.660\n and they're tough military guys.\n\n1:26:53.660 --> 1:26:57.180\n But they're on board for this mission, let's say.\n\n1:26:57.180 --> 1:26:58.620\n And so they went out of their way\n\n1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:01.380\n to be hospitable to my academic guests.\n\n1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:04.300\n They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.\n\n1:27:04.300 --> 1:27:06.300\n They spent all day preparing this house\n\n1:27:06.300 --> 1:27:09.020\n I had rented so that we could have a hospitable time\n\n1:27:09.020 --> 1:27:09.860\n with these scholars.\n\n1:27:09.860 --> 1:27:11.180\n Most of whom I didn't know well,\n\n1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:13.460\n but who said they would come and spend eight days\n\n1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:15.460\n talking about this book with me.\n\n1:27:15.460 --> 1:27:16.740\n We rented some jet skis.\n\n1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:18.060\n We had a nice house.\n\n1:27:18.060 --> 1:27:19.700\n We had fun.\n\n1:27:19.700 --> 1:27:21.420\n And we got to know each other.\n\n1:27:21.420 --> 1:27:22.860\n And we got to trust each other\n\n1:27:22.860 --> 1:27:24.660\n because we could see that we could have some fun\n\n1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:26.420\n and that we could let our hair down a bit.\n\n1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:27.860\n We didn't have to be on guard.\n\n1:27:27.860 --> 1:27:30.780\n And that made the talks way deeper.\n\n1:27:30.780 --> 1:27:33.700\n And then we found out we couldn't get through Exodus\n\n1:27:33.700 --> 1:27:34.540\n in eight days.\n\n1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:37.420\n And so I had proposed very early on\n\n1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:38.780\n that we're gonna double the length.\n\n1:27:38.780 --> 1:27:41.020\n And so I pulled eight people out of their lives\n\n1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:42.860\n for eight days.\n\n1:27:42.860 --> 1:27:44.940\n That's not an easy thing to do.\n\n1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:46.300\n It's also quite expensive.\n\n1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:49.060\n And the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.\n\n1:27:49.060 --> 1:27:50.180\n And they said, right.\n\n1:27:50.180 --> 1:27:51.940\n They said, yes, right away.\n\n1:27:51.940 --> 1:27:53.900\n So we'd love to do this again.\n\n1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:54.900\n Well, why?\n\n1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.460\n Well, partly because it was intellectually,\n\n1:27:57.460 --> 1:27:58.740\n it was unbelievably engaging.\n\n1:27:58.740 --> 1:27:59.580\n I learned so much.\n\n1:27:59.580 --> 1:28:01.540\n It'll take me like a year to digest it\n\n1:28:01.540 --> 1:28:03.380\n if I can ever digest it.\n\n1:28:04.900 --> 1:28:08.420\n But they had a really good time.\n\n1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:11.020\n And so when they were offered that combination\n\n1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:14.420\n of intellectual challenge, let's say in hospitality,\n\n1:28:14.420 --> 1:28:15.540\n it was a no brainer.\n\n1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:17.660\n They just said, every one of them said,\n\n1:28:17.660 --> 1:28:20.340\n if I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there.\n\n1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:24.100\n And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times\n\n1:28:24.100 --> 1:28:26.900\n and the culture of hospitality has broken down\n\n1:28:26.900 --> 1:28:28.260\n in Washington.\n\n1:28:28.260 --> 1:28:31.620\n 40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.\n\n1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:33.140\n They don't have apartments.\n\n1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:35.140\n Their family isn't there with them.\n\n1:28:35.140 --> 1:28:39.700\n They don't have social occasions with their fellow Democrats\n\n1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:43.060\n or Republicans, much less across the table.\n\n1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:46.020\n And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington\n\n1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:48.460\n that were bilateral a couple of times,\n\n1:28:48.460 --> 1:28:50.500\n get young Republican congressmen\n\n1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:52.580\n and Democrats together to talk.\n\n1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:54.020\n And as soon as they talk, they think,\n\n1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:55.980\n oh, it was so interesting.\n\n1:28:55.980 --> 1:28:59.180\n Cause one of the lunches was about 15 people,\n\n1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:01.300\n half Democrats and half Republicans.\n\n1:29:01.300 --> 1:29:03.820\n And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes\n\n1:29:03.820 --> 1:29:06.340\n talking about why you decided to become a congressman,\n\n1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:08.460\n which is not a job I would take, by the way.\n\n1:29:09.420 --> 1:29:12.900\n You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.\n\n1:29:12.900 --> 1:29:14.860\n Your family isn't there with you.\n\n1:29:14.860 --> 1:29:17.700\n You have to run for reelection every two years.\n\n1:29:17.700 --> 1:29:20.620\n You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?\n\n1:29:20.620 --> 1:29:22.580\n You're vilified constantly.\n\n1:29:22.580 --> 1:29:25.060\n This is not, you know, people think,\n\n1:29:25.060 --> 1:29:26.820\n well, this is a job for the privileged.\n\n1:29:26.820 --> 1:29:29.700\n It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress\n\n1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:30.940\n and find out how much fun it is\n\n1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:32.100\n and put your family on the line\n\n1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:34.260\n and then have to beg for your job every two years\n\n1:29:34.260 --> 1:29:37.100\n while your enemies, the worst of your enemies\n\n1:29:37.100 --> 1:29:38.420\n and the worst of your friends\n\n1:29:38.420 --> 1:29:41.340\n are viciously hen pecking you.\n\n1:29:41.340 --> 1:29:43.540\n And so anyways, we had them all sit around the table\n\n1:29:43.540 --> 1:29:47.740\n and said, okay, just say why you ran for Congress.\n\n1:29:47.740 --> 1:29:49.500\n It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,\n\n1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:51.700\n cause you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.\n\n1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:53.140\n It's such something to watch.\n\n1:29:54.260 --> 1:29:56.140\n It was like, Mr. Smith goes to Washington\n\n1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:56.980\n for every one of them.\n\n1:29:56.980 --> 1:29:59.180\n It's like, well, this country has given us so much,\n\n1:29:59.180 --> 1:30:02.140\n where our families have been so,\n\n1:30:02.140 --> 1:30:05.340\n we've benefited so much from our time here.\n\n1:30:05.340 --> 1:30:06.820\n We think this is a wonderful country.\n\n1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:09.220\n We really felt that we should give back.\n\n1:30:09.220 --> 1:30:10.500\n And the next one would talk.\n\n1:30:10.500 --> 1:30:12.220\n And it was like exactly the same story.\n\n1:30:12.220 --> 1:30:13.500\n And then it didn't matter\n\n1:30:13.500 --> 1:30:14.740\n if they were Republican or Democrat,\n\n1:30:14.740 --> 1:30:15.740\n you couldn't tell the difference.\n\n1:30:15.740 --> 1:30:16.900\n No one could.\n\n1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:17.940\n And was it genuine?\n\n1:30:17.940 --> 1:30:20.260\n It's like, well, are you genuine?\n\n1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:22.260\n You think these people are worse than you?\n\n1:30:23.140 --> 1:30:25.260\n First of all, they're not.\n\n1:30:25.260 --> 1:30:27.700\n Second of all, they're probably better.\n\n1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:29.220\n All things considered,\n\n1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:31.780\n it's not that easy to become a Congressman.\n\n1:30:31.780 --> 1:30:34.220\n And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,\n\n1:30:34.220 --> 1:30:35.660\n but by and large,\n\n1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:37.740\n you walk away from your meetings with these people\n\n1:30:37.740 --> 1:30:42.060\n and you think, pretty impressive.\n\n1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:44.180\n They really are giving a part of themselves\n\n1:30:44.180 --> 1:30:45.540\n in the name of service.\n\n1:30:45.540 --> 1:30:48.180\n Maybe over time, they become cynical\n\n1:30:48.180 --> 1:30:52.780\n and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.\n\n1:30:52.780 --> 1:30:54.140\n But I think a lot of it.\n\n1:30:54.140 --> 1:30:55.620\n Could you imagine that?\n\n1:30:55.620 --> 1:30:58.260\n Is healed, I think.\n\n1:30:58.260 --> 1:31:01.020\n And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,\n\n1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.340\n but not fully,\n\n1:31:02.340 --> 1:31:03.740\n that a lot of it is healed\n\n1:31:03.740 --> 1:31:05.500\n through the power of conversation,\n\n1:31:05.500 --> 1:31:08.180\n just basic social interaction.\n\n1:31:08.180 --> 1:31:11.980\n I do think that the effects of this pandemic.\n\n1:31:11.980 --> 1:31:13.940\n Especially by listening.\n\n1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:15.460\n Listen, just sitting there.\n\n1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:17.980\n And it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.\n\n1:31:17.980 --> 1:31:21.620\n It's actually humor and all those kinds of things\n\n1:31:21.620 --> 1:31:23.940\n about personal struggles,\n\n1:31:23.940 --> 1:31:26.260\n all those kinds of things that remind you\n\n1:31:26.260 --> 1:31:29.220\n that you're all just humans.\n\n1:31:29.220 --> 1:31:31.500\n Well, the great leaders that I've met,\n\n1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:32.700\n and I've met some now,\n\n1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:36.100\n they go listen to their constituents.\n\n1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:37.380\n It's not a policy discussion.\n\n1:31:37.380 --> 1:31:38.660\n It's not an ideology discussion.\n\n1:31:38.660 --> 1:31:42.260\n They go say, okay, what's your life like?\n\n1:31:42.260 --> 1:31:43.580\n And what are your problems?\n\n1:31:43.580 --> 1:31:45.740\n And tell me about them.\n\n1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:47.940\n And then they listen and then they're struck by them.\n\n1:31:47.940 --> 1:31:49.700\n And then they gather up all that misery\n\n1:31:49.700 --> 1:31:52.260\n and they bring it to the congressional office\n\n1:31:52.260 --> 1:31:53.180\n or to the parliament.\n\n1:31:53.180 --> 1:31:57.620\n And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.\n\n1:31:57.620 --> 1:32:00.580\n And the good leaders, that's a leader.\n\n1:32:00.580 --> 1:32:02.460\n Leader listens.\n\n1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:06.820\n So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.\n\n1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:11.820\n And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour, being funny.\n\n1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:14.340\n That's hard.\n\n1:32:14.340 --> 1:32:17.420\n He said, comedy is the most standup comedy,\n\n1:32:18.300 --> 1:32:20.820\n which is what I do in some real sense.\n\n1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:23.420\n It's a thing I do that it's most akin\n\n1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:25.780\n to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.\n\n1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:27.420\n It's the closest analog.\n\n1:32:27.420 --> 1:32:29.780\n He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.\n\n1:32:29.780 --> 1:32:32.340\n And I thought, well, why, what do you mean?\n\n1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:34.180\n Cause see, it's just the monologue.\n\n1:32:34.180 --> 1:32:36.220\n And it's a prepared monologue.\n\n1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:39.860\n I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience\n\n1:32:39.860 --> 1:32:40.940\n while you're telling your jokes\n\n1:32:40.940 --> 1:32:42.020\n and you gotta get the timing right,\n\n1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:44.660\n but you have a body of jokes.\n\n1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:47.140\n He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.\n\n1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:49.460\n And I've been told this by other comedians.\n\n1:32:49.460 --> 1:32:52.580\n You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour\n\n1:32:52.580 --> 1:32:55.260\n and you got some new material and you think it's funny.\n\n1:32:55.260 --> 1:32:58.540\n And you go into a club and you lay out your new material\n\n1:32:58.540 --> 1:33:00.500\n and people laugh at some of it.\n\n1:33:01.860 --> 1:33:04.500\n And you pay attention to what they laugh at\n\n1:33:04.500 --> 1:33:06.340\n and what they don't laugh at.\n\n1:33:06.340 --> 1:33:09.020\n So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd\n\n1:33:09.020 --> 1:33:11.340\n and you get rid of everything that isn't funny.\n\n1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:14.500\n And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,\n\n1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:17.140\n the crowd will tell you what's funny.\n\n1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:20.020\n So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows\n\n1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:21.020\n and each is an hour long\n\n1:33:21.020 --> 1:33:24.460\n and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.\n\n1:33:24.460 --> 1:33:27.940\n So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,\n\n1:33:27.940 --> 1:33:31.820\n more than 98% of it, collect two minutes per show.\n\n1:33:32.780 --> 1:33:34.260\n So you're not very funny at all.\n\n1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:35.860\n You're like funny 2% of the time.\n\n1:33:35.860 --> 1:33:38.860\n You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.\n\n1:33:38.860 --> 1:33:41.420\n So that's what a leader does is,\n\n1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:43.140\n that is what a leader does is goes out\n\n1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:46.900\n and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.\n\n1:33:46.900 --> 1:33:48.900\n And then I do think that's revivify\n\n1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:52.100\n to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded\n\n1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:54.580\n because then the person can say to themselves,\n\n1:33:54.580 --> 1:33:58.700\n despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,\n\n1:33:58.700 --> 1:34:02.540\n I'm gathering up the misery and the hope\n\n1:34:02.540 --> 1:34:06.540\n and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.\n\n1:34:06.540 --> 1:34:07.580\n Giving it a voice.\n\n1:34:07.580 --> 1:34:09.380\n Yeah, that's right, giving it a voice.\n\n1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:10.860\n Can you actually take me through a day\n\n1:34:10.860 --> 1:34:14.620\n because this is fascinating, through your comedy tour.\n\n1:34:14.620 --> 1:34:19.620\n What does a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?\n\n1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:22.500\n Which is this very interesting day.\n\n1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:24.740\n Let's look at the day when you have to speak.\n\n1:34:25.660 --> 1:34:27.180\n Preparing your mind,\n\n1:34:27.180 --> 1:34:30.060\n thinking of what you're going to talk about,\n\n1:34:30.060 --> 1:34:33.660\n preparing yourself physically and mentally\n\n1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:37.260\n to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking,\n\n1:34:37.260 --> 1:34:39.780\n how do you adjust what you're thinking through\n\n1:34:39.780 --> 1:34:41.740\n and how do you come down from that?\n\n1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:46.540\n So you can start all again as a limited biological system.\n\n1:34:47.940 --> 1:34:51.300\n Well, I'm usually up by seven\n\n1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:55.660\n and ready to go by 7.30 or eight.\n\n1:34:56.740 --> 1:34:57.820\n Coffee?\n\n1:34:57.820 --> 1:35:00.460\n No, steak and water.\n\n1:35:00.460 --> 1:35:02.460\n How many times a day steak?\n\n1:35:02.460 --> 1:35:03.780\n All, that's all I eat.\n\n1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:05.060\n How many times?\n\n1:35:05.060 --> 1:35:07.220\n Three or four, depending on the day.\n\n1:35:07.220 --> 1:35:08.060\n Steak and water.\n\n1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:09.500\n Steak and sparkling water.\n\n1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:12.980\n Yeah, so monastic asceticism, man.\n\n1:35:12.980 --> 1:35:16.140\n Well, I did the proper, I usually just once a day,\n\n1:35:16.140 --> 1:35:18.740\n I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night\n\n1:35:18.740 --> 1:35:19.820\n and just ate two steaks.\n\n1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:20.980\n And how was that?\n\n1:35:20.980 --> 1:35:22.380\n It was wonderful.\n\n1:35:22.380 --> 1:35:24.580\n Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing,\n\n1:35:25.580 --> 1:35:27.060\n you know, could be worse.\n\n1:35:27.060 --> 1:35:28.940\n So anyways, I'm ready to go at eight\n\n1:35:28.940 --> 1:35:30.460\n because we're generally moving.\n\n1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:32.700\n What does moving mean?\n\n1:35:32.700 --> 1:35:33.900\n Flying. You're constantly.\n\n1:35:33.900 --> 1:35:35.220\n Flying somewhere.\n\n1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:36.060\n Okay.\n\n1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:38.180\n And we usually use private flights now\n\n1:35:38.180 --> 1:35:41.540\n because the commercial airlines aren't reliable enough\n\n1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:44.700\n and you cannot not make a venue, right?\n\n1:35:44.700 --> 1:35:46.500\n So that's rule number one on a tour.\n\n1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:48.860\n You make the show.\n\n1:35:50.380 --> 1:35:52.660\n So everything, and then number rule number two\n\n1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:56.700\n is anybody who causes any trouble on the tour is gone\n\n1:35:56.700 --> 1:35:59.340\n because there is zero room for error.\n\n1:35:59.340 --> 1:36:04.260\n Now, no, there's zero room for unnecessary,\n\n1:36:04.260 --> 1:36:05.260\n unaddressed error.\n\n1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:06.540\n So there's gonna be errors.\n\n1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:10.580\n The guys I have around me now, if they make a mistake,\n\n1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:12.020\n they fix it right away.\n\n1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:13.660\n So, and that's great.\n\n1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:15.780\n There's a lot of people relying on you to be there.\n\n1:36:15.780 --> 1:36:16.620\n So you have to be there.\n\n1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:19.900\n Yeah, like 4,000 people typically.\n\n1:36:19.900 --> 1:36:24.900\n So then I'm on the plane and I usually write or often\n\n1:36:28.180 --> 1:36:31.100\n because there's no internet on the plane\n\n1:36:31.100 --> 1:36:32.500\n and that's a good use of time.\n\n1:36:32.500 --> 1:36:33.740\n So I'm writing a new book.\n\n1:36:33.740 --> 1:36:34.820\n So I write on the plane.\n\n1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:36.220\n Typing or handwriting?\n\n1:36:36.220 --> 1:36:38.940\n Typing, yeah, typing.\n\n1:36:38.940 --> 1:36:43.580\n And then we land and we go to,\n\n1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:47.340\n it's usually early afternoon by then we go to a hotel.\n\n1:36:47.340 --> 1:36:48.780\n It's usually a nice hotel.\n\n1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:49.660\n It's not corporate.\n\n1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:51.460\n I don't really like corporate hotels.\n\n1:36:51.460 --> 1:36:54.700\n My secretary and one of my logistics guys\n\n1:36:54.700 --> 1:36:59.180\n has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels,\n\n1:36:59.180 --> 1:37:01.740\n boutique hotels are usually in the old parts of the city,\n\n1:37:01.740 --> 1:37:03.980\n especially in Europe, somewhere interesting.\n\n1:37:03.980 --> 1:37:08.900\n And so we go there and then lunch usually.\n\n1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:11.620\n And sometimes that's an air fryer and a steak\n\n1:37:11.620 --> 1:37:12.460\n in the hotel room.\n\n1:37:12.460 --> 1:37:14.460\n And I leave a trail of air fryers behind me\n\n1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:15.980\n all across the world.\n\n1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:20.580\n And then Tammy and I usually go out and have a walk\n\n1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:22.540\n or something and take a look at the city.\n\n1:37:22.540 --> 1:37:25.100\n And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half\n\n1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:26.300\n or an hour, half an hour.\n\n1:37:26.300 --> 1:37:27.140\n Like a nap?\n\n1:37:27.140 --> 1:37:27.980\n Yeah, nap.\n\n1:37:27.980 --> 1:37:29.380\n I have to sleep for 20 minutes.\n\n1:37:29.380 --> 1:37:30.420\n And that's about all I can sleep,\n\n1:37:30.420 --> 1:37:31.740\n but I need to do that in the late afternoon.\n\n1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:32.900\n That refreshes your mind.\n\n1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:36.380\n Yeah, that gives me, that wakes me up again for the evening.\n\n1:37:36.380 --> 1:37:38.260\n And then Tam has to sleep longer.\n\n1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:40.140\n She's still recovering from her illness.\n\n1:37:40.140 --> 1:37:42.500\n And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon\n\n1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:44.380\n and that's absolutely necessary for both of us\n\n1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:46.540\n or things start to get frayed.\n\n1:37:46.540 --> 1:37:48.860\n And so then we go to the venue\n\n1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:54.660\n and then I usually sit for an hour.\n\n1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:56.940\n If I'm gonna lecture, I've been doing a lot of Q and A's\n\n1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:57.860\n and that's a little easier.\n\n1:37:57.860 --> 1:38:01.060\n But if I'm gonna lecture, I have to sit for an hour.\n\n1:38:01.060 --> 1:38:06.060\n And then I think, okay, what question am I trying\n\n1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:07.620\n to investigate?\n\n1:38:07.620 --> 1:38:09.700\n I have to have that, that's the point.\n\n1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:13.140\n What mystery am I trying to unravel?\n\n1:38:13.140 --> 1:38:15.620\n It's usually associated with one of the rules in my book\n\n1:38:15.620 --> 1:38:17.700\n because technically it's a book tour,\n\n1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:21.700\n but each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.\n\n1:38:21.700 --> 1:38:24.580\n And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery\n\n1:38:24.580 --> 1:38:25.420\n in some sense.\n\n1:38:25.420 --> 1:38:28.820\n And there's no end to the amount that can be explored.\n\n1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:30.820\n And so I have the question,\n\n1:38:30.820 --> 1:38:35.820\n my question might be something like put your house\n\n1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.420\n in perfect order before you criticize the world.\n\n1:38:38.420 --> 1:38:40.740\n Okay, what does that mean exactly?\n\n1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:42.300\n What does house mean?\n\n1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:46.740\n What does put mean, that active verb?\n\n1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:48.940\n What is perfect in order mean?\n\n1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:51.260\n Why before you criticize the world?\n\n1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:52.900\n What does it mean to criticize?\n\n1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:54.660\n What does it mean to criticize the world?\n\n1:38:54.660 --> 1:38:56.820\n How can you do that properly or improperly?\n\n1:38:56.820 --> 1:38:59.300\n So I start to think about how to decompose the question.\n\n1:38:59.300 --> 1:39:02.140\n And you start to think which of these decompositions\n\n1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:03.780\n are important to really dig into?\n\n1:39:03.780 --> 1:39:05.060\n Yeah, well, then they'll strike me.\n\n1:39:05.060 --> 1:39:06.380\n It's like, okay, there's something there\n\n1:39:06.380 --> 1:39:09.060\n that I've been maybe noodling around on\n\n1:39:09.060 --> 1:39:11.140\n that I would like to investigate further.\n\n1:39:11.140 --> 1:39:13.660\n Then I think, okay, how can I approach this problem?\n\n1:39:13.660 --> 1:39:16.220\n I think, well, I have this story that I know,\n\n1:39:16.220 --> 1:39:17.900\n I have this story and I have this story,\n\n1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:19.940\n but I haven't juxtaposed them before.\n\n1:39:19.940 --> 1:39:21.900\n And there's gonna be some interesting interaction\n\n1:39:21.900 --> 1:39:23.420\n in the juxtaposition.\n\n1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:24.780\n So I have the question\n\n1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:27.500\n and I kind of have a framework of interpretation.\n\n1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:31.060\n And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.\n\n1:39:31.060 --> 1:39:33.300\n And then I think, okay, I can go juggle that\n\n1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:35.100\n and see what happens.\n\n1:39:35.100 --> 1:39:38.820\n And so then what I wanna do is concentrate on that process\n\n1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.340\n while attending to the audience\n\n1:39:40.340 --> 1:39:42.500\n to make sure that the words are landing\n\n1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:45.020\n and then see if I can delve into it deeply enough\n\n1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:50.020\n so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.\n\n1:39:50.620 --> 1:39:53.420\n Now, I'm sure you've experienced this in podcasts, right?\n\n1:39:53.420 --> 1:39:56.100\n Maybe I'm wrong, but my experience has been\n\n1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:58.380\n if I fall into the conversation\n\n1:39:58.380 --> 1:40:00.780\n and we know about the timeframe,\n\n1:40:00.780 --> 1:40:03.620\n there'll be a natural narrative arc.\n\n1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:06.140\n And then, so you'll kind of know when the midpoint is\n\n1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:08.020\n and you'll kind of see when you're reaching a conclusion.\n\n1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.340\n And then if you really pay attention,\n\n1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:12.020\n you can see that's a good place to stop.\n\n1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:15.300\n And it's kind of, you come to a point\n\n1:40:15.300 --> 1:40:20.180\n and you have to be alert and patient to see that.\n\n1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:22.300\n And you have to be willing to be satisfied\n\n1:40:22.300 --> 1:40:24.140\n with where you've got to.\n\n1:40:24.140 --> 1:40:26.660\n But if you do that, and then it's like a comedian\n\n1:40:26.660 --> 1:40:28.700\n making the punchline work.\n\n1:40:28.700 --> 1:40:32.220\n It's like, I've got all these balls in the air\n\n1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:33.820\n and they're going somewhere\n\n1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:36.380\n and this is how they come together.\n\n1:40:36.380 --> 1:40:37.660\n And people love that, right?\n\n1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:40.100\n They say, oh, this and this and this and this and this.\n\n1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:42.660\n Whack, together.\n\n1:40:42.660 --> 1:40:43.620\n And that's an insight.\n\n1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:45.980\n And it is very much like a punchline.\n\n1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:48.260\n Well, that's interesting because your mind actually,\n\n1:40:48.260 --> 1:40:49.860\n so I'm a fan of your podcast too.\n\n1:40:49.860 --> 1:40:53.380\n And you are always driving towards that.\n\n1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:57.060\n I would say for me in a podcast conversation,\n\n1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:00.700\n there's often a kind of Alice in Wonderland\n\n1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:02.260\n type of exploration.\n\n1:41:02.260 --> 1:41:03.540\n Down the rabbit hole, man.\n\n1:41:03.540 --> 1:41:06.180\n And then you just, a new thing pops up,\n\n1:41:06.180 --> 1:41:08.820\n the more absurd, the wilder, the better.\n\n1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:10.860\n Conversations with Elon are like this.\n\n1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:14.180\n It's like, actually the more you drive towards an arc,\n\n1:41:14.180 --> 1:41:16.300\n the more uncomfortable you start to get\n\n1:41:16.300 --> 1:41:19.740\n in a fun, absurd conversation because,\n\n1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:22.420\n oh, I'm now one of the normies.\n\n1:41:22.420 --> 1:41:23.460\n No, I don't want that.\n\n1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:25.700\n I wanna be, I want the rabbit.\n\n1:41:25.700 --> 1:41:29.740\n I want the crazy because it makes it more fun.\n\n1:41:29.740 --> 1:41:33.740\n But somehow throughout it, there is wisdom\n\n1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:37.500\n that you try to grasp at such that there is a thread.\n\n1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:38.580\n Well, that's the thing, man.\n\n1:41:38.580 --> 1:41:40.340\n You're following the thread, eh?\n\n1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:42.940\n Yeah, the thread's the, well, that's right.\n\n1:41:42.940 --> 1:41:45.500\n That's what we're trying to do, that thread.\n\n1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.220\n That thread is the proper balance\n\n1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:49.100\n between structure and spontaneity.\n\n1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180\n And it manifests itself as the instinct of meaning.\n\n1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:54.740\n And that's the logos in the dialogos.\n\n1:41:54.740 --> 1:41:55.980\n And it really is the logos.\n\n1:41:55.980 --> 1:41:57.740\n And God only knows what that means.\n\n1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:00.380\n You know, I mean, the biblical claim\n\n1:42:00.380 --> 1:42:03.740\n is that logos is the fundamental principle of reality.\n\n1:42:03.740 --> 1:42:05.700\n And I think that's true.\n\n1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.900\n I actually think that's true\n\n1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.580\n because I think that that meaning that guides you,\n\n1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:11.820\n well, here's a way of thinking about it.\n\n1:42:11.820 --> 1:42:14.220\n I've been writing about this recently.\n\n1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.100\n What's real matter?\n\n1:42:17.100 --> 1:42:19.220\n It's like, okay, that's one answer.\n\n1:42:19.220 --> 1:42:20.100\n What's real?\n\n1:42:20.100 --> 1:42:22.180\n What matters is real.\n\n1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:24.020\n Because that's how you act.\n\n1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:25.900\n Okay, so that's different than matter.\n\n1:42:26.900 --> 1:42:30.740\n It's like, okay, what's the most real of what matters?\n\n1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:32.820\n How about pain?\n\n1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:35.500\n Why is it the most real?\n\n1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:37.060\n Try arguing it away.\n\n1:42:38.380 --> 1:42:39.220\n Good luck.\n\n1:42:40.220 --> 1:42:43.100\n So pain is the fundamental reality.\n\n1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:43.940\n All right.\n\n1:42:44.940 --> 1:42:46.860\n Well, that's rough.\n\n1:42:46.860 --> 1:42:50.220\n Doesn't that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?\n\n1:42:50.220 --> 1:42:53.780\n Yeah, doesn't it lead to a philosophy\n\n1:42:53.780 --> 1:42:55.780\n that's antithetical towards being\n\n1:42:55.780 --> 1:42:58.700\n the most fundamental reality is pain?\n\n1:42:58.700 --> 1:42:59.740\n Yes.\n\n1:42:59.740 --> 1:43:01.940\n Is there anything more fundamental than pain?\n\n1:43:03.620 --> 1:43:04.460\n Love.\n\n1:43:06.500 --> 1:43:07.340\n Really?\n\n1:43:08.300 --> 1:43:09.420\n If you're in pain,\n\n1:43:13.780 --> 1:43:14.900\n love and truth,\n\n1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:17.100\n that's what you got.\n\n1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:18.940\n And you know,\n\n1:43:24.020 --> 1:43:26.700\n if they're more powerful than pain,\n\n1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:28.500\n maybe they're the most real things.\n\n1:43:31.580 --> 1:43:33.580\n When you think about reality, what is real?\n\n1:43:33.580 --> 1:43:36.100\n That is the most real thing.\n\n1:43:36.100 --> 1:43:37.460\n Well, it's a tough one, right?\n\n1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:39.060\n Because you have to,\n\n1:43:39.060 --> 1:43:41.020\n because if you're a scientist, a materialist,\n\n1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:44.940\n think, well, the matter is the most real.\n\n1:43:44.940 --> 1:43:47.460\n It's like, well, you don't know what the matter is.\n\n1:43:47.460 --> 1:43:48.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:49.700\n And so, and then when push comes to shove,\n\n1:43:49.700 --> 1:43:53.020\n and it will, you'll find out what's most real.\n\n1:43:53.020 --> 1:43:53.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:54.860 --> 1:43:59.180\n I feel like this is missing,\n\n1:43:59.180 --> 1:44:03.460\n the physical reality is missing some of the things.\n\n1:44:03.460 --> 1:44:05.940\n So of course pain has a biological component\n\n1:44:05.940 --> 1:44:06.820\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:44:06.820 --> 1:44:10.620\n but it's missing something deep about the human condition\n\n1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:15.220\n that at least the modern science is not able to describe,\n\n1:44:15.220 --> 1:44:17.220\n but it is reaching towards that.\n\n1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:18.060\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:21.060\n And it's the reason, one way to describe it\n\n1:44:21.060 --> 1:44:23.660\n as you're describing is the reason it's reaching it\n\n1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:27.340\n is because underneath of science is this assumption\n\n1:44:27.340 --> 1:44:29.420\n that there's a deep.\n\n1:44:30.460 --> 1:44:31.940\n Logos.\n\n1:44:31.940 --> 1:44:34.740\n Thing to this whole thing we're trying to do.\n\n1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:36.540\n Well, you know, there's two traditions, right?\n\n1:44:36.540 --> 1:44:39.500\n In some sense, there's two logos traditions.\n\n1:44:39.500 --> 1:44:44.300\n There's the Greek rational enlightenment tradition.\n\n1:44:44.300 --> 1:44:45.780\n That's a logos tradition.\n\n1:44:45.780 --> 1:44:48.420\n And it insists that there's a logos in nature\n\n1:44:48.420 --> 1:44:50.620\n and that science is the way to approach it.\n\n1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:52.500\n And then there's a Judeo Christian logos,\n\n1:44:52.500 --> 1:44:55.060\n which is more embodied and more spiritual.\n\n1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.140\n And I would say the West is actually an attempt\n\n1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:59.020\n to unite those two.\n\n1:44:59.020 --> 1:45:01.580\n And it's the proper attempt to unite those two\n\n1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:04.860\n because they need to be united.\n\n1:45:04.860 --> 1:45:07.460\n And I see the union coming in your terms.\n\n1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:09.700\n You know, I talked to friends to wall, for example\n\n1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:13.380\n about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.\n\n1:45:13.380 --> 1:45:15.260\n And that's pretty close biologically.\n\n1:45:15.260 --> 1:45:16.820\n Is it power?\n\n1:45:16.820 --> 1:45:19.380\n Cause that's the claim even from the biologists often\n\n1:45:19.380 --> 1:45:23.660\n the most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.\n\n1:45:23.660 --> 1:45:26.140\n It's like, oh yeah, dominant.\n\n1:45:26.140 --> 1:45:28.340\n Hey, you mean using compulsion?\n\n1:45:28.340 --> 1:45:29.940\n Okay, let's look.\n\n1:45:29.940 --> 1:45:34.620\n Are the chimps who use compulsion the most successful?\n\n1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:39.100\n And the answer is sporadically and rarely.\n\n1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:41.460\n And for short, well, that's sporadically\n\n1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:43.020\n for short periods of time.\n\n1:45:43.020 --> 1:45:44.100\n Why?\n\n1:45:44.100 --> 1:45:46.660\n Because they meet an unpleasant end.\n\n1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:52.420\n The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control\n\n1:45:52.420 --> 1:45:56.940\n wait for a weak moment and then tear them into shreds, right?\n\n1:45:56.940 --> 1:46:00.540\n Every dictators terror and for good reason.\n\n1:46:00.540 --> 1:46:03.020\n And the wall has showed that the alpha chimps,\n\n1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:07.340\n the males who do have preferential mating access often\n\n1:46:07.340 --> 1:46:12.060\n are often and reliably the best peacemakers\n\n1:46:12.060 --> 1:46:14.140\n and the most reciprocal.\n\n1:46:14.140 --> 1:46:16.620\n And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty\n\n1:46:16.620 --> 1:46:21.620\n is something like iterative, iterated reciprocity.\n\n1:46:23.020 --> 1:46:26.860\n And that's a way better principle than power.\n\n1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:28.740\n And it's something like I've been thinking\n\n1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:31.620\n what's the antithesis of the spirit of power.\n\n1:46:31.620 --> 1:46:33.500\n I think it's the spirit of play.\n\n1:46:35.340 --> 1:46:37.460\n And I don't know what you think about that,\n\n1:46:37.460 --> 1:46:39.620\n but when you have a good podcast conversation,\n\n1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:41.900\n you already described it in some sense as play.\n\n1:46:41.900 --> 1:46:43.420\n It's like, there's a structure, right?\n\n1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:45.940\n Cause it's an ordered conversation,\n\n1:46:45.940 --> 1:46:48.140\n but you want there to be play in the system.\n\n1:46:48.140 --> 1:46:51.340\n And if you get that right, then it's really engaging.\n\n1:46:51.340 --> 1:46:54.860\n And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.\n\n1:46:54.860 --> 1:46:56.780\n I'm not trying to impose that even though\n\n1:46:56.780 --> 1:46:58.140\n that's another thing I don't do.\n\n1:46:58.140 --> 1:47:01.300\n I didn't come to this conversation at all thinking,\n\n1:47:01.300 --> 1:47:03.220\n here's what I want out of a conversation\n\n1:47:03.220 --> 1:47:06.020\n with Lex Friedman, like instrumentally.\n\n1:47:06.020 --> 1:47:08.860\n I thought, I'll go talk to Lex.\n\n1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:09.700\n Why?\n\n1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:13.140\n I like his podcasts.\n\n1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:14.500\n He's doing something right.\n\n1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:15.820\n I don't know what it is.\n\n1:47:15.820 --> 1:47:17.940\n He asks interesting questions.\n\n1:47:17.940 --> 1:47:19.780\n I'll go have a conversation with him.\n\n1:47:19.780 --> 1:47:20.900\n Where's it gonna go?\n\n1:47:22.180 --> 1:47:23.460\n Wherever it goes.\n\n1:47:24.420 --> 1:47:26.340\n Embracing the spirit of play.\n\n1:47:26.340 --> 1:47:30.020\n So what you have this, when you're lecturing,\n\n1:47:30.020 --> 1:47:32.060\n you're going in front of the crowd,\n\n1:47:32.060 --> 1:47:36.380\n you thought of a question, you get on the stage.\n\n1:47:36.380 --> 1:47:38.300\n First of all, are you nervous at all?\n\n1:47:39.580 --> 1:47:43.060\n I'm very nervous when I'm sitting down,\n\n1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.060\n thinking through the structure initially,\n\n1:47:46.060 --> 1:47:49.020\n which is why my wife and I have been doing Q and As\n\n1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:50.820\n and that's easier on me.\n\n1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:54.460\n It's the way comedians are nervous.\n\n1:47:54.460 --> 1:47:59.180\n Like Joe Rogan just did his special this weekend.\n\n1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:03.820\n And so he now has to sit nervously like a comedian does,\n\n1:48:03.820 --> 1:48:07.020\n which is like, I have no material now.\n\n1:48:07.020 --> 1:48:07.860\n Right.\n\n1:48:07.860 --> 1:48:08.700\n I have to start from scratch.\n\n1:48:08.700 --> 1:48:10.780\n When I was doing the lectures constantly\n\n1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:13.420\n instead of the Q and As,\n\n1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:15.340\n basically what I was doing was writing\n\n1:48:15.340 --> 1:48:16.940\n a whole book chapter every night.\n\n1:48:17.820 --> 1:48:20.300\n And now that's a bit of an exaggeration\n\n1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:22.660\n because I would return to themes that I had developed,\n\n1:48:22.660 --> 1:48:24.500\n but it's not really an exaggeration\n\n1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:29.500\n because I didn't ever just go over wrote material ever.\n\n1:48:30.220 --> 1:48:34.540\n So it's very demanding and that part's nerve wracking\n\n1:48:34.540 --> 1:48:36.420\n because I sit down, it's an hour before the show\n\n1:48:36.420 --> 1:48:41.020\n and I think, can I do this?\n\n1:48:41.020 --> 1:48:45.020\n And the answer is, well, you did it a thousand times,\n\n1:48:45.020 --> 1:48:46.900\n but that's not this time.\n\n1:48:46.900 --> 1:48:49.140\n It's like, can I come up with a question?\n\n1:48:49.140 --> 1:48:51.260\n Can I think through the structure?\n\n1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:56.140\n Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?\n\n1:48:56.140 --> 1:48:57.420\n Can I pull it together?\n\n1:48:57.420 --> 1:49:00.060\n And the answer is, I don't know.\n\n1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:02.660\n And so then I get it together in my mind, I think,\n\n1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:03.500\n and that's hard.\n\n1:49:03.500 --> 1:49:05.780\n It takes effort and it's nerve wracking.\n\n1:49:06.820 --> 1:49:07.700\n Okay, I got it.\n\n1:49:07.700 --> 1:49:09.660\n But then there's the moment you go out on stage\n\n1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:13.420\n and you think, well, I know I had it, but can I do it?\n\n1:49:13.420 --> 1:49:15.140\n No notes.\n\n1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:16.340\n And then the question is,\n\n1:49:16.340 --> 1:49:18.860\n well, you're gonna find out while you do it.\n\n1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:22.860\n And so then I go out on stage and I don't talk\n\n1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:26.620\n to the audience, I talk to one person at a time.\n\n1:49:27.740 --> 1:49:29.580\n And you can talk to one person,\n\n1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:30.540\n cause you know how to do that.\n\n1:49:30.540 --> 1:49:32.420\n So I talk to a person and not too long\n\n1:49:32.420 --> 1:49:33.860\n cause I don't wanna make them too nervous\n\n1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:35.940\n and then someone else and someone else.\n\n1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:37.980\n And then I'm in contact with the audience\n\n1:49:37.980 --> 1:49:41.100\n and then I can tell if the words are landing\n\n1:49:41.100 --> 1:49:43.540\n and I listen, it's like, are they rustling around?\n\n1:49:44.580 --> 1:49:46.100\n Are they dead quiet?\n\n1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:47.660\n Cause you want dead quiet.\n\n1:49:47.660 --> 1:49:49.380\n You're, oh, I see.\n\n1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:52.060\n That's what focus sounds like.\n\n1:49:52.060 --> 1:49:53.460\n You're in it together then.\n\n1:49:53.460 --> 1:49:54.300\n You bet.\n\n1:49:54.300 --> 1:49:55.660\n Well, and I also, here's a good rule\n\n1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.700\n if you're learning to speak publicly,\n\n1:49:57.700 --> 1:50:02.700\n I never say a word till everyone is 100% quiet.\n\n1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:06.660\n And that's, it's a great way to start a talk\n\n1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:08.940\n because you're setting the frame,\n\n1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:11.580\n and if the frame is we'll all talk while you're talking,\n\n1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:14.420\n the message is, well, you can talk.\n\n1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:16.220\n This is a place where everybody can talk.\n\n1:50:16.220 --> 1:50:17.900\n It's like, no, it's not.\n\n1:50:17.900 --> 1:50:21.180\n This is a place where people paid to hear me talk.\n\n1:50:21.180 --> 1:50:24.020\n So I'm not gonna talk till everyone's listening.\n\n1:50:24.020 --> 1:50:26.980\n And so then you get that stillness\n\n1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:28.180\n and then you just wait\n\n1:50:28.180 --> 1:50:30.820\n cause that stillness turns into an expectation.\n\n1:50:30.820 --> 1:50:34.420\n And then it comes, turns into a kind of nervous expectations\n\n1:50:34.420 --> 1:50:35.940\n like what the hell is he doing?\n\n1:50:35.940 --> 1:50:37.140\n It's not manipulative.\n\n1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:38.740\n It's a sense of timing.\n\n1:50:38.740 --> 1:50:40.420\n It's like just when that's right,\n\n1:50:40.420 --> 1:50:42.940\n you think, okay, now it's time to start.\n\n1:50:42.940 --> 1:50:46.220\n Well, the interesting thing about that nervous expectation\n\n1:50:46.220 --> 1:50:49.380\n is from an audience perspective, we're in it together.\n\n1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:50.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:51.580\n I mean, there is into that silence,\n\n1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:53.100\n there's a togetherness to it.\n\n1:50:53.100 --> 1:50:55.420\n Of course, it's the union of everyone's attention.\n\n1:50:55.420 --> 1:50:56.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:56.260 --> 1:50:58.460\n Yeah, and that's a great thing.\n\n1:50:58.460 --> 1:51:00.740\n I mean, you love that at a concert when everyone,\n\n1:51:00.740 --> 1:51:01.740\n it's not silence then,\n\n1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:03.940\n but when everyone's attention is unified\n\n1:51:03.940 --> 1:51:05.260\n and everyone's moving in unison,\n\n1:51:05.260 --> 1:51:09.340\n it's like we're all worshiping the same thing, right?\n\n1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:11.500\n And that would be the point of the conversation,\n\n1:51:11.500 --> 1:51:13.700\n the point of the lecture.\n\n1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:16.660\n And the worship is the direction of attention towards it.\n\n1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.260\n And it's union, it's communion\n\n1:51:18.260 --> 1:51:20.660\n because everyone's doing it at the same time.\n\n1:51:20.660 --> 1:51:23.300\n And so, I mean, there's not much difference\n\n1:51:23.300 --> 1:51:25.700\n between a lecture theater and a church in that regard, right?\n\n1:51:25.700 --> 1:51:28.460\n It's the same fundamental layout and structure.\n\n1:51:28.460 --> 1:51:30.980\n And they're very integrally associated with one another.\n\n1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:32.260\n One really grew out of the other,\n\n1:51:32.260 --> 1:51:34.380\n the lecture theater grew out of the church.\n\n1:51:34.380 --> 1:51:36.340\n So it's perfectly reasonable\n\n1:51:36.340 --> 1:51:38.580\n to be thinking about it in those terms.\n\n1:51:38.580 --> 1:51:42.180\n And so, and then, okay, so after the lecture,\n\n1:51:42.180 --> 1:51:45.580\n we play a piece of music that is a piece of music\n\n1:51:45.580 --> 1:51:47.980\n that I've been producing with some musicians\n\n1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:51.020\n for a couple of books I'm gonna release in the fall.\n\n1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:53.780\n Terrible books, ABC of childhood tragedy,\n\n1:51:53.780 --> 1:51:57.180\n they're called dark, dark books,\n\n1:51:58.500 --> 1:52:02.300\n dark and comical books, terrible books,\n\n1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:05.260\n heartbreaking illustrations.\n\n1:52:06.340 --> 1:52:07.620\n We've set them to music.\n\n1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:09.420\n And so we play a piece from that.\n\n1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:13.620\n And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people\n\n1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:14.580\n to have photographs.\n\n1:52:14.580 --> 1:52:17.220\n And so each of those is a little.\n\n1:52:17.220 --> 1:52:20.020\n Is there a little sparkle of human connection?\n\n1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:24.700\n A lot, a lot, it's very intense.\n\n1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:27.060\n 10 seconds with every person you think,\n\n1:52:27.060 --> 1:52:28.660\n how can 10 seconds be intense?\n\n1:52:28.660 --> 1:52:31.900\n It's like, pay enough attention.\n\n1:52:31.900 --> 1:52:33.300\n It gets intense real quick.\n\n1:52:33.300 --> 1:52:36.940\n Does it break your heart to say goodbye so many times?\n\n1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:39.260\n It's like being in a wedding lineup,\n\n1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:41.220\n at a wedding that you wanna be at.\n\n1:52:41.220 --> 1:52:42.820\n And everybody's dressed up.\n\n1:52:42.820 --> 1:52:43.860\n And that's so weird,\n\n1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:45.340\n because I bought these expensive suits\n\n1:52:45.340 --> 1:52:47.700\n when I went on tour and it broke my heart\n\n1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:48.980\n because I spent so much money on them.\n\n1:52:48.980 --> 1:52:51.420\n I thought, God, that's completely unconscionable.\n\n1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:55.500\n I thought, no way, man, I'm in this 100%.\n\n1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:58.820\n And so I'm gonna dress with respect.\n\n1:52:58.820 --> 1:53:03.820\n And like 60% of the audience comes in\n\n1:53:04.420 --> 1:53:05.940\n two or three piece suits.\n\n1:53:05.940 --> 1:53:07.500\n They're all dressed up.\n\n1:53:07.500 --> 1:53:09.300\n Then there's this line to greet me\n\n1:53:09.300 --> 1:53:11.260\n and they're all happy to see me.\n\n1:53:11.260 --> 1:53:13.260\n That's not so hard to take.\n\n1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:15.120\n You know, although it is in a sense, right?\n\n1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:19.060\n Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.\n\n1:53:19.060 --> 1:53:21.060\n And you think, I don't want shallow interactions.\n\n1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:22.860\n It's like, yes, you do most of the time.\n\n1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:24.540\n Yeah, it's intense.\n\n1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:25.740\n It's very intense.\n\n1:53:25.740 --> 1:53:26.580\n And I don't know if you have.\n\n1:53:26.580 --> 1:53:28.340\n But you've had a taste of this, no doubt,\n\n1:53:28.340 --> 1:53:29.180\n because people recognize you.\n\n1:53:29.180 --> 1:53:31.300\n Yeah, but I also have,\n\n1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:34.540\n when a person recognizes me and they come with the love\n\n1:53:34.540 --> 1:53:37.380\n and they're often brilliant people,\n\n1:53:37.380 --> 1:53:39.860\n one of the thoughts I have to deal with,\n\n1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:43.020\n one of the dragons in my own mind is, you know,\n\n1:53:43.020 --> 1:53:45.860\n thinking that I don't deserve that kind of attention.\n\n1:53:45.860 --> 1:53:46.700\n And so.\n\n1:53:46.700 --> 1:53:48.220\n Well, you probably don't.\n\n1:53:48.220 --> 1:53:49.060\n Right.\n\n1:53:49.060 --> 1:53:50.300\n But maybe you could.\n\n1:53:50.300 --> 1:53:53.060\n So it's a burden in that I have to step up\n\n1:53:53.060 --> 1:53:56.260\n to be the kind of person that deserves that,\n\n1:53:56.260 --> 1:53:58.200\n not deserves that, but in part deserves\n\n1:53:58.200 --> 1:53:59.140\n that kind of attention.\n\n1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:01.300\n And that's like, holy shit.\n\n1:54:01.300 --> 1:54:02.580\n It's crucially important too,\n\n1:54:02.580 --> 1:54:05.220\n because if someone comes up to you in an airport\n\n1:54:05.220 --> 1:54:08.100\n and they know who you are and they're brave enough\n\n1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:11.260\n to admire you or who you are attempting to be\n\n1:54:11.260 --> 1:54:16.260\n and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.\n\n1:54:16.780 --> 1:54:19.380\n So it's a high stakes enterprise.\n\n1:54:19.380 --> 1:54:23.180\n And the flip side of that, especially with young people,\n\n1:54:23.180 --> 1:54:25.460\n a few words you can say can change the direction\n\n1:54:25.460 --> 1:54:26.420\n of their life.\n\n1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:28.180\n One way or another.\n\n1:54:28.180 --> 1:54:30.300\n And so I really have to watch this too in airports\n\n1:54:30.300 --> 1:54:31.700\n because I do not like airports.\n\n1:54:31.700 --> 1:54:34.620\n I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.\n\n1:54:34.620 --> 1:54:36.380\n They've always bothered me.\n\n1:54:36.380 --> 1:54:38.380\n They really bother me.\n\n1:54:38.380 --> 1:54:40.300\n And I'm an unpleasant travel companion\n\n1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:42.020\n for my wife sometimes because of that.\n\n1:54:42.020 --> 1:54:43.540\n Although I think we've worked that out.\n\n1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:46.420\n Thank God, cause we're doing a lot of traveling.\n\n1:54:46.420 --> 1:54:50.900\n But most of the security guards and the border personnel,\n\n1:54:50.900 --> 1:54:52.340\n all those people, they know me.\n\n1:54:52.340 --> 1:54:55.660\n And as a general rule, they're positively predisposed to me.\n\n1:54:55.660 --> 1:54:57.740\n And so if I'm peevish or irritable,\n\n1:54:57.740 --> 1:55:00.940\n then well, that's not good.\n\n1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:02.100\n It's not good.\n\n1:55:02.100 --> 1:55:03.860\n And so that's a tight rope to walk to\n\n1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:07.180\n because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.\n\n1:55:07.180 --> 1:55:12.180\n But by the same token, if you're just one of the crowd,\n\n1:55:12.180 --> 1:55:16.940\n just, sometimes it's good just to be one of the crowd\n\n1:55:16.940 --> 1:55:18.180\n and then you're a little irritable\n\n1:55:18.180 --> 1:55:19.700\n and people can just brush that off.\n\n1:55:19.700 --> 1:55:24.860\n But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to,\n\n1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:29.860\n cause that's what admiration is, and then you betray that,\n\n1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:34.100\n then that's a real, they'll never forget it.\n\n1:55:34.100 --> 1:55:36.500\n And then they'll tell everyone too.\n\n1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:39.540\n So it takes a lot of alertness.\n\n1:55:39.540 --> 1:55:41.740\n And so Tammy and our life has got complicated\n\n1:55:41.740 --> 1:55:43.860\n because in Toronto, for example,\n\n1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:46.500\n we can't really just go for a walk.\n\n1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:49.180\n It's always a high drama production\n\n1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:52.580\n cause always people come up and they have some\n\n1:55:52.580 --> 1:55:55.060\n heart rending story to tell.\n\n1:55:55.060 --> 1:55:57.140\n And I'm not being cynical about that.\n\n1:55:57.140 --> 1:55:58.380\n Yes.\n\n1:55:58.380 --> 1:56:02.740\n It's a hard thing to bear because people don't do that.\n\n1:56:02.740 --> 1:56:04.900\n They don't just open themselves up to you like that\n\n1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:06.700\n and share the tragedy of their life.\n\n1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:11.660\n But that's an everyday occurrence.\n\n1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:13.580\n And so when we go up to our cottage,\n\n1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:17.300\n which is out of the city, it's a relief,\n\n1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:21.420\n because as wonderful as that is,\n\n1:56:21.420 --> 1:56:23.140\n like it's a weird, I have a weird life\n\n1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:25.860\n because everywhere I go, it's very weird.\n\n1:56:25.860 --> 1:56:28.340\n It's like I'm surrounded by old friends\n\n1:56:28.340 --> 1:56:31.580\n because I walk down the street in any city now virtually\n\n1:56:31.580 --> 1:56:34.660\n and people say, hello, Dr. Peterson, so nice to see you.\n\n1:56:34.660 --> 1:56:36.260\n Or they say better things than that.\n\n1:56:36.260 --> 1:56:38.060\n Very rarely bad things.\n\n1:56:38.060 --> 1:56:42.060\n One experience in 5,000, maybe very rare,\n\n1:56:42.060 --> 1:56:44.220\n although you don't forget those either,\n\n1:56:44.220 --> 1:56:46.780\n but it's very strange.\n\n1:56:48.020 --> 1:56:48.860\n So.\n\n1:56:48.860 --> 1:56:50.860\n And there's an intimacy, they know you well.\n\n1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:54.540\n And because they leap into,\n\n1:56:55.540 --> 1:56:57.540\n they avoid the small talk often.\n\n1:56:57.540 --> 1:56:58.740\n They leap into familiarity.\n\n1:56:58.740 --> 1:57:00.900\n It really is like it's an old friend\n\n1:57:00.900 --> 1:57:01.860\n and it feels like that.\n\n1:57:01.860 --> 1:57:06.460\n For me personally, the experiences, the goodbye hurts\n\n1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:09.860\n because there's a sense\n\n1:57:09.860 --> 1:57:11.580\n where you're never gonna see that friend again.\n\n1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:12.700\n Right.\n\n1:57:12.700 --> 1:57:14.380\n Yeah, that's a strange thing, eh?\n\n1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:19.380\n So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.\n\n1:57:19.380 --> 1:57:20.740\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:57:20.740 --> 1:57:22.500\n It is.\n\n1:57:22.500 --> 1:57:23.340\n You're right about that.\n\n1:57:23.340 --> 1:57:26.660\n And I mean, that's, I suppose, in some sense,\n\n1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:29.500\n part of the pain of opening yourself up to people\n\n1:57:29.500 --> 1:57:33.020\n because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly.\n\n1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:35.380\n She said, I really never knew what men were like.\n\n1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:36.860\n I said, well, what do you mean?\n\n1:57:36.860 --> 1:57:41.060\n She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are\n\n1:57:41.060 --> 1:57:42.620\n when they come and talk to you\n\n1:57:42.620 --> 1:57:43.900\n because it's always the same.\n\n1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:45.580\n The pattern's very similar.\n\n1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:47.140\n The person comes up, they're mostly men,\n\n1:57:47.140 --> 1:57:49.140\n not always, but mostly.\n\n1:57:49.140 --> 1:57:51.660\n And they're tentative and they're very polite,\n\n1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.500\n very, very polite.\n\n1:57:53.500 --> 1:57:55.540\n And they say, I hope I'm not bothering you.\n\n1:57:55.540 --> 1:57:57.460\n Do you mind, you know, do you mind that I say\n\n1:57:57.460 --> 1:57:59.100\n that they're not bothering me?\n\n1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:03.220\n And I'm doing everything I can to not be the guy\n\n1:58:03.220 --> 1:58:04.420\n who's bothered by that.\n\n1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:05.780\n It's like, who do you think you are?\n\n1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:07.460\n Yeah, yes.\n\n1:58:07.460 --> 1:58:12.100\n You're the guy that what is famous and now is above that?\n\n1:58:12.100 --> 1:58:13.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:15.260\n You don't wanna be that guy.\n\n1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:17.740\n So you wanna be grateful all the time\n\n1:58:17.740 --> 1:58:20.540\n when people open up like that.\n\n1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:23.260\n And so you gotta be alert and on point\n\n1:58:23.260 --> 1:58:25.180\n to do that properly, like right away.\n\n1:58:25.180 --> 1:58:28.620\n Because for you, it's five seconds or 10 seconds\n\n1:58:28.620 --> 1:58:30.140\n or 20 seconds, whatever it is.\n\n1:58:30.140 --> 1:58:33.980\n But for them, they've opened up.\n\n1:58:33.980 --> 1:58:37.540\n And so you can really nail them if you're foolish.\n\n1:58:37.540 --> 1:58:40.660\n After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?\n\n1:58:40.660 --> 1:58:44.660\n How do you find yourself again?\n\n1:58:44.660 --> 1:58:48.420\n Well, that was when I got caught in Twitter traps,\n\n1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:52.020\n cause I'm so burnt out by then from the talk\n\n1:58:52.020 --> 1:58:56.220\n and the audience interactions and the whole day.\n\n1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.740\n Cause it's a new city, it's a new hotel,\n\n1:58:58.740 --> 1:59:02.260\n it's a new 5,000 people, it's a new book chapter,\n\n1:59:02.260 --> 1:59:04.180\n it's a whole new horizon of ideas.\n\n1:59:04.180 --> 1:59:06.740\n And it's off to another city the next day.\n\n1:59:06.740 --> 1:59:10.740\n I'm so burnt out by then that I'm not as good\n\n1:59:10.740 --> 1:59:13.500\n at controlling my impulses as I might be.\n\n1:59:13.500 --> 1:59:15.340\n And Twitter was a real catastrophe for that\n\n1:59:15.340 --> 1:59:17.500\n cause it would hook me and then I couldn't,\n\n1:59:17.500 --> 1:59:20.820\n like I used to, when I was working on my book a lot,\n\n1:59:20.820 --> 1:59:22.620\n I used to call Tammy and say, look,\n\n1:59:22.620 --> 1:59:25.420\n you have to come and get me, I can't stop.\n\n1:59:25.420 --> 1:59:28.420\n I can't stop, I got tired and then I kind of,\n\n1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:31.700\n cause it's part of a kind of hypomanic focus.\n\n1:59:31.700 --> 1:59:34.700\n I couldn't quit, it's like, oh no, I'm still writing.\n\n1:59:34.700 --> 1:59:37.300\n I need to get away from this, but I couldn't stop.\n\n1:59:37.300 --> 1:59:44.980\n And so it's better to read something, a book.\n\n1:59:44.980 --> 1:59:46.100\n Fiction, nonfiction.\n\n1:59:46.100 --> 1:59:48.500\n Fiction, Stephen King.\n\n1:59:48.500 --> 1:59:50.300\n I was reading a lot of Stephen King\n\n1:59:50.300 --> 1:59:52.420\n when I was on tour last time, that was good.\n\n1:59:52.420 --> 1:59:53.260\n I like Stephen King a lot.\n\n1:59:53.260 --> 1:59:54.580\n It's a great narrative.\n\n1:59:54.580 --> 1:59:57.780\n Great, and great characterization, you know?\n\n1:59:57.780 --> 2:00:02.220\n So, and there's a familiarity about Stephen King's\n\n2:00:02.220 --> 2:00:05.340\n writing too that it's, he writes about people you know.\n\n2:00:05.340 --> 2:00:08.140\n And so I really found that a relief.\n\n2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:10.300\n And so that was useful.\n\n2:00:10.300 --> 2:00:12.940\n And that in order to tolerate this, let's say,\n\n2:00:12.940 --> 2:00:14.260\n or to be able to sustain it,\n\n2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:16.740\n well, let's take a lot of negotiation\n\n2:00:16.740 --> 2:00:17.860\n on the part of Tammy and I,\n\n2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:21.420\n because she's dragged into this and, you know,\n\n2:00:21.420 --> 2:00:25.100\n her life is part of this, whatever this is.\n\n2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:29.060\n And she's had to find her way and has, for example,\n\n2:00:29.060 --> 2:00:32.380\n now she has a different hotel room than me when we travel.\n\n2:00:32.380 --> 2:00:35.380\n And she found that she didn't want to be on the tour\n\n2:00:35.380 --> 2:00:37.940\n this spring, and I was ill again for part of it.\n\n2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:39.060\n And that made it complicated,\n\n2:00:39.060 --> 2:00:42.180\n but she went away back home and she came back\n\n2:00:42.180 --> 2:00:43.420\n and she said, and she was nervous about,\n\n2:00:43.420 --> 2:00:45.420\n she said, I think I need my own room.\n\n2:00:45.420 --> 2:00:47.140\n And part of me was not happy with that.\n\n2:00:47.140 --> 2:00:48.500\n It's like, what do you mean you need your,\n\n2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:50.340\n like, are we not married anymore?\n\n2:00:50.340 --> 2:00:52.380\n It's like, you need your own room?\n\n2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:54.860\n And she said, well, you know, I can't,\n\n2:00:54.860 --> 2:00:57.300\n she has to do exercises because she was really sick\n\n2:00:57.300 --> 2:00:59.860\n and she has to keep herself in shape.\n\n2:00:59.860 --> 2:01:02.220\n And she has to have some time to do that.\n\n2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:03.780\n She does a lot of prayer and meditation\n\n2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:04.700\n and she needs the time.\n\n2:01:04.700 --> 2:01:06.860\n And she has her own podcast, which is going quite well.\n\n2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:09.660\n And she needs the time and I trust her.\n\n2:01:09.660 --> 2:01:12.420\n And she said, well, I need this in order to continue.\n\n2:01:12.420 --> 2:01:15.180\n And I thought, well, okay,\n\n2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:19.020\n if you need this in order to continue, yes.\n\n2:01:19.020 --> 2:01:20.980\n Because she went away and didn't say, well,\n\n2:01:20.980 --> 2:01:22.540\n I don't want to be on the tour.\n\n2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:23.500\n I don't want to do this anymore.\n\n2:01:23.500 --> 2:01:25.940\n She went away and prayed, let's say,\n\n2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:28.740\n how can I continue to do this?\n\n2:01:28.740 --> 2:01:30.420\n And that was the answer.\n\n2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.740\n And so she has her own hotel room.\n\n2:01:32.740 --> 2:01:36.100\n And that was a really good decision on her part.\n\n2:01:36.100 --> 2:01:39.700\n And she's very good and getting better all the time\n\n2:01:39.700 --> 2:01:43.820\n at figuring out what has to happen for her\n\n2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:45.180\n to make this sustainable.\n\n2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:48.380\n And all that's been is a plus\n\n2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:51.020\n because I don't want to travel without her.\n\n2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:53.580\n And I don't want her life to be miserable.\n\n2:01:53.580 --> 2:01:55.540\n And I want her to be fully on board.\n\n2:01:55.540 --> 2:01:58.340\n And so she has to be properly selfish.\n\n2:01:58.340 --> 2:02:00.780\n Like everyone does in a relationship.\n\n2:02:00.780 --> 2:02:02.900\n And you have to, not just that,\n\n2:02:02.900 --> 2:02:05.260\n this is a weird thing that you're doing.\n\n2:02:05.260 --> 2:02:08.180\n And you have to, both you and her have to figure out\n\n2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:13.020\n how to manage this very intense intellectual,\n\n2:02:13.020 --> 2:02:13.860\n social journey.\n\n2:02:13.860 --> 2:02:15.180\n Well, there's another element to it too\n\n2:02:15.180 --> 2:02:16.340\n that I didn't tell you about.\n\n2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:19.460\n So that was a typical day, but it's missing a big component\n\n2:02:19.460 --> 2:02:22.100\n because usually we also have a dinner\n\n2:02:22.100 --> 2:02:26.780\n with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose,\n\n2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:28.700\n 10 to 30 from each country.\n\n2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:32.100\n Cause I have a network of people who have networks\n\n2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:35.780\n who are setting me up with key decision makers\n\n2:02:35.780 --> 2:02:37.140\n in each country.\n\n2:02:37.140 --> 2:02:39.540\n And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.\n\n2:02:39.540 --> 2:02:42.420\n Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk,\n\n2:02:42.420 --> 2:02:44.860\n but sometimes the talks are back to back.\n\n2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:49.700\n And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.\n\n2:02:49.700 --> 2:02:51.700\n And then people are showing us exciting things\n\n2:02:51.700 --> 2:02:53.940\n and tours in the cities and which is all,\n\n2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:56.380\n like it's a surf fight of wonderful.\n\n2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:57.340\n Yes, exactly.\n\n2:02:57.340 --> 2:03:00.220\n But it's still, yeah, you have to be there for it.\n\n2:03:00.220 --> 2:03:02.140\n You have to be present for it mentally.\n\n2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:02.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:02.980 --> 2:03:04.980\n As a curious mind, as an intellectual mind.\n\n2:03:04.980 --> 2:03:07.820\n How do you get to sleep?\n\n2:03:07.820 --> 2:03:11.820\n Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.\n\n2:03:11.820 --> 2:03:16.820\n Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years.\n\n2:03:17.220 --> 2:03:18.700\n I thought about that a lot too, you know,\n\n2:03:18.700 --> 2:03:21.380\n that I didn't do a really good job of explaining that\n\n2:03:21.380 --> 2:03:24.760\n while I was ill because it appeared in some sense\n\n2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:26.880\n that the reason I was ill was because I was taking\n\n2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:30.860\n benzodiazepines, but that isn't why I was ill.\n\n2:03:30.860 --> 2:03:33.580\n And then I took them and very low dose.\n\n2:03:33.580 --> 2:03:36.140\n And I took that for a long time and it helped\n\n2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:37.300\n whatever was wrong with me.\n\n2:03:37.300 --> 2:03:39.380\n And it looks like it was an allergy\n\n2:03:39.380 --> 2:03:41.020\n or maybe multiple allergies.\n\n2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:45.000\n And then that stopped working.\n\n2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.860\n And so I took a little bit more for about a month\n\n2:03:47.860 --> 2:03:48.980\n and that made it way worse.\n\n2:03:48.980 --> 2:03:52.220\n And so then I cut back a lot and then,\n\n2:03:52.220 --> 2:03:54.300\n then things really got out of hand.\n\n2:03:54.300 --> 2:03:55.140\n So.\n\n2:03:55.140 --> 2:03:57.700\n So there was a deeper thing in the Benzo.\n\n2:03:57.700 --> 2:03:58.540\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:03:58.540 --> 2:04:00.180\n What can you put words to?\n\n2:04:00.180 --> 2:04:02.220\n Well, I had a lot of immune, well, my daughter,\n\n2:04:02.220 --> 2:04:06.040\n as everyone knows, has a very reactive immune system.\n\n2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:09.800\n And Tammy has three immunological conditions,\n\n2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:11.420\n each of them quite serious.\n\n2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:14.360\n And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis,\n\n2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:17.740\n which is an autoimmune condition and alopecia areata\n\n2:04:17.740 --> 2:04:21.460\n and chronic gum disease, all of which appeared\n\n2:04:21.460 --> 2:04:22.980\n to be allergy related.\n\n2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:25.660\n And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.\n\n2:04:25.660 --> 2:04:28.420\n And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of,\n\n2:04:28.420 --> 2:04:30.540\n cause I also had this proclivity to depression\n\n2:04:30.540 --> 2:04:32.840\n that was part of my family history.\n\n2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:34.700\n But I think that was all immunological\n\n2:04:34.700 --> 2:04:35.540\n as far as I can tell.\n\n2:04:35.540 --> 2:04:37.780\n So one of the things that's happened to me,\n\n2:04:37.780 --> 2:04:40.460\n I always noticed I really couldn't breathe.\n\n2:04:40.460 --> 2:04:42.220\n Like I could breathe about one fifth\n\n2:04:42.220 --> 2:04:45.140\n as much as I sometimes could.\n\n2:04:46.500 --> 2:04:48.420\n And so I was always short of breath.\n\n2:04:48.420 --> 2:04:53.060\n And it looks like what that was perhaps was\n\n2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:56.380\n I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction,\n\n2:04:56.380 --> 2:04:57.640\n which is not pleasant.\n\n2:04:58.740 --> 2:05:01.140\n And that's hypersympathetic activation,\n\n2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:03.140\n no parasympathetic activation.\n\n2:05:03.140 --> 2:05:05.380\n I couldn't relax at all.\n\n2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:07.380\n That's an immunological response.\n\n2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:08.840\n Allergic response, yeah.\n\n2:05:09.980 --> 2:05:11.580\n So anyways, that was what seemed,\n\n2:05:11.580 --> 2:05:14.420\n now this, I don't like to talk about this much\n\n2:05:14.420 --> 2:05:15.700\n cause it's so bloody radical\n\n2:05:15.700 --> 2:05:17.220\n and I don't like to propagate it,\n\n2:05:17.220 --> 2:05:19.580\n but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.\n\n2:05:19.580 --> 2:05:22.580\n I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone.\n\n2:05:22.580 --> 2:05:25.420\n My gum disease, which is incurable,\n\n2:05:25.420 --> 2:05:27.180\n I had multiple surgeries to deal with it,\n\n2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:30.300\n is completely gone, took three years.\n\n2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:32.180\n My right eye, which was quite cloudy,\n\n2:05:32.180 --> 2:05:33.480\n it's cleared up completely.\n\n2:05:35.820 --> 2:05:36.880\n What else has changed?\n\n2:05:36.880 --> 2:05:41.180\n Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly kept it off.\n\n2:05:41.180 --> 2:05:45.860\n I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator\n\n2:05:45.860 --> 2:05:47.700\n of nutritional science.\n\n2:05:47.700 --> 2:05:49.620\n I have my skepticism towards the degree\n\n2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:51.580\n to which it is currently as a science.\n\n2:05:51.580 --> 2:05:55.460\n Cause like a lot of complex systems is full of mystery\n\n2:05:55.460 --> 2:05:57.960\n and full of profiteers,\n\n2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:00.100\n the people that profit of different kinds of diets.\n\n2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:02.300\n But I should say for me personally,\n\n2:06:02.300 --> 2:06:05.100\n it does seem that I feel by far the best\n\n2:06:05.100 --> 2:06:06.340\n when I eat only meat.\n\n2:06:06.340 --> 2:06:07.260\n It's very interesting.\n\n2:06:07.260 --> 2:06:10.020\n And I discovered that a long time ago.\n\n2:06:10.020 --> 2:06:10.860\n First of all.\n\n2:06:10.860 --> 2:06:12.220\n How did you discover it?\n\n2:06:12.220 --> 2:06:15.540\n So by, the discovery went like this.\n\n2:06:15.540 --> 2:06:17.920\n I started listening to ultra marathon runners\n\n2:06:17.920 --> 2:06:20.380\n about 15 years ago.\n\n2:06:20.380 --> 2:06:25.380\n And they started talking about fat adapted running.\n\n2:06:27.260 --> 2:06:31.100\n So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast\n\n2:06:31.100 --> 2:06:32.420\n to enjoy running.\n\n2:06:32.420 --> 2:06:35.420\n And in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.\n\n2:06:36.380 --> 2:06:37.500\n So that was like step one.\n\n2:06:37.500 --> 2:06:38.380\n It's like, oh, okay.\n\n2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:42.780\n If I maintain something called the math rule,\n\n2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:45.020\n which is the pretty low heart rate.\n\n2:06:45.020 --> 2:06:47.760\n If I maintain that you can actually get pretty fast\n\n2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:50.660\n while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.\n\n2:06:50.660 --> 2:06:54.860\n Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.\n\n2:06:55.740 --> 2:06:57.300\n So I got into that.\n\n2:06:57.300 --> 2:07:00.620\n On top of that, I also, they also fast often.\n\n2:07:00.620 --> 2:07:05.620\n So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted.\n\n2:07:05.660 --> 2:07:08.180\n You know, people call it intermittent fasting, but.\n\n2:07:08.180 --> 2:07:11.920\n Well, that's an optimization of death because you're,\n\n2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:16.100\n when you fast, your body, logically and obviously,\n\n2:07:16.100 --> 2:07:18.460\n if you think about it biologically is,\n\n2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:20.920\n well, what is your body scavenge first?\n\n2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:23.060\n Well, damaged tissue.\n\n2:07:24.220 --> 2:07:27.940\n So the, and I know the literature on fasting\n\n2:07:27.940 --> 2:07:30.680\n to some degree, and it's very compelling literature.\n\n2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:35.080\n If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too,\n\n2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:38.180\n below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.\n\n2:07:38.180 --> 2:07:43.180\n That's a lot, 30%, like it's like 30%, yeah, 30%.\n\n2:07:43.860 --> 2:07:46.380\n Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things\n\n2:07:46.380 --> 2:07:48.740\n that make me nervous because I always feel like\n\n2:07:48.740 --> 2:07:51.520\n there's no free lunch that I'm gonna pay for it somehow.\n\n2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:55.980\n But there's a focus that I am able to attain when I fast,\n\n2:07:55.980 --> 2:07:57.900\n especially when I eat once a day.\n\n2:07:57.900 --> 2:08:01.360\n My mind is almost like nervously focused.\n\n2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:04.100\n It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one\n\n2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:07.180\n or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.\n\n2:08:07.180 --> 2:08:10.500\n You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with,\n\n2:08:10.500 --> 2:08:13.980\n well, imagine that that signifies lack of food,\n\n2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:16.000\n which not that hard to imagine.\n\n2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:17.900\n Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert\n\n2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:19.300\n in that situation, right?\n\n2:08:19.300 --> 2:08:22.780\n Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode,\n\n2:08:22.780 --> 2:08:26.580\n let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode.\n\n2:08:26.580 --> 2:08:29.460\n And God only knows maybe human beings\n\n2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:31.180\n should be in hunting mode all the time.\n\n2:08:31.180 --> 2:08:32.860\n Often, but we don't know that.\n\n2:08:32.860 --> 2:08:37.500\n So I wonder if it has a stress on the system\n\n2:08:37.500 --> 2:08:39.940\n that long term causes the system to get sick.\n\n2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:41.260\n It doesn't look like it.\n\n2:08:41.260 --> 2:08:43.620\n It seems in the case of fasting, not.\n\n2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:46.340\n And then on top of that, I discovered that\n\n2:08:46.340 --> 2:08:51.340\n the thing I enjoy, I just don't enjoy eating fat as much.\n\n2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:55.600\n So I love eating meat when you talk about low carb diet.\n\n2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:57.980\n So I just discovered through that process,\n\n2:08:57.980 --> 2:09:00.860\n if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat,\n\n2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:03.900\n I just feel a lot of the things\n\n2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:05.500\n that make me feel weird about food,\n\n2:09:05.500 --> 2:09:10.500\n like a little groggy or like full or just whatever,\n\n2:09:11.620 --> 2:09:14.100\n the aspects of food that I don't enjoy,\n\n2:09:14.100 --> 2:09:15.740\n they're not there with meat.\n\n2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:18.420\n And I'm still able to enjoy company.\n\n2:09:18.420 --> 2:09:22.300\n And when I eat once a day and eat meat,\n\n2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:24.420\n I said, at least in Texas,\n\n2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:27.180\n you could still have all the merriment of,\n\n2:09:27.180 --> 2:09:28.780\n you have dinner with friends.\n\n2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:33.060\n Now, I don't do the, you have a very serious thing\n\n2:09:33.060 --> 2:09:37.140\n that there's health benefits\n\n2:09:37.140 --> 2:09:39.420\n that you are very serious about.\n\n2:09:39.420 --> 2:09:41.500\n For me, I can still drink whiskey.\n\n2:09:41.500 --> 2:09:46.500\n I'll still do the things that add a little bit of spice\n\n2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:47.580\n into the thing.\n\n2:09:47.580 --> 2:09:49.700\n Now, when you completely remove the spice,\n\n2:09:49.700 --> 2:09:52.300\n it does become more difficult.\n\n2:09:52.300 --> 2:09:53.740\n Yeah, it's more difficult socially.\n\n2:09:53.740 --> 2:09:56.540\n And Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb,\n\n2:09:56.540 --> 2:09:58.860\n although she might be able to eat non aged beef.\n\n2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:02.220\n And that makes traveling complicated too, right?\n\n2:10:02.220 --> 2:10:04.620\n Because, well, for obvious reasons,\n\n2:10:04.620 --> 2:10:06.660\n it's like, really, that's all you can eat?\n\n2:10:08.020 --> 2:10:09.780\n Yeah, well, celeries.\n\n2:10:09.780 --> 2:10:12.300\n And maybe that's a form of craziness, but.\n\n2:10:12.300 --> 2:10:13.940\n If we can return to actually the thing\n\n2:10:13.940 --> 2:10:15.540\n you were talking about,\n\n2:10:15.540 --> 2:10:18.460\n when you were thinking about a question before the lecture.\n\n2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:20.660\n Let me ask you about thinking in general.\n\n2:10:22.860 --> 2:10:25.220\n This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller\n\n2:10:25.220 --> 2:10:27.780\n think a lot about is thinking how to think.\n\n2:10:29.140 --> 2:10:32.900\n How do you think through an idea?\n\n2:10:32.900 --> 2:10:35.500\n Well, first of all, I think, okay,\n\n2:10:36.460 --> 2:10:38.060\n that's a really good question.\n\n2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:40.100\n We tried to work that out with this essay app\n\n2:10:40.100 --> 2:10:41.460\n that my son and I have developed,\n\n2:10:41.460 --> 2:10:42.700\n because if you're gonna write,\n\n2:10:42.700 --> 2:10:45.060\n the first question is, well, what should I write about?\n\n2:10:45.060 --> 2:10:46.060\n What's the name of the app?\n\n2:10:46.060 --> 2:10:48.140\n Essay.app.\n\n2:10:48.140 --> 2:10:53.140\n And, well, the first question is, well, what bugs you?\n\n2:10:53.540 --> 2:10:54.820\n What's bugging you?\n\n2:10:54.820 --> 2:10:56.020\n This is such a cool thing.\n\n2:10:56.020 --> 2:10:57.820\n It's like, where is my destiny?\n\n2:10:59.220 --> 2:11:00.780\n Well, what bothers you?\n\n2:11:00.780 --> 2:11:02.180\n Well, that's where your destiny is.\n\n2:11:02.180 --> 2:11:04.860\n Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.\n\n2:11:04.860 --> 2:11:07.340\n Why did those things bother you?\n\n2:11:07.340 --> 2:11:09.660\n There's a lot of things you could be bothered by.\n\n2:11:09.660 --> 2:11:11.460\n Like a million things, man.\n\n2:11:11.460 --> 2:11:13.580\n But some things grip you.\n\n2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:14.500\n They bug you.\n\n2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:16.700\n And they might make you resentful and bitter,\n\n2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:17.900\n because they bug you so much.\n\n2:11:17.900 --> 2:11:20.020\n Like, they're your things, man.\n\n2:11:20.020 --> 2:11:21.500\n They've got you.\n\n2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:23.700\n So then I look for a question\n\n2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:25.980\n that I would like the answer to,\n\n2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:29.740\n that I don't, and I would really like the answer to it,\n\n2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:32.380\n so I don't assume I already have the answer,\n\n2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:35.340\n because I would actually really like to have the answer.\n\n2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:39.220\n So if I could get a better answer, great.\n\n2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:40.220\n And so that's the first thing.\n\n2:11:40.220 --> 2:11:41.660\n And that's like a prayer.\n\n2:11:41.660 --> 2:11:45.300\n It's like, okay, here's a mystery.\n\n2:11:45.300 --> 2:11:49.740\n I would like to delve into it further.\n\n2:11:49.740 --> 2:11:51.060\n Well, so that's humility.\n\n2:11:51.060 --> 2:11:52.620\n It's like, here's a mystery,\n\n2:11:52.620 --> 2:11:54.100\n which means I don't know.\n\n2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:55.900\n I would like to delve into it further,\n\n2:11:55.900 --> 2:11:58.100\n which means I don't know enough already.\n\n2:11:58.940 --> 2:12:01.860\n And then comes the revelation.\n\n2:12:01.860 --> 2:12:04.340\n It's like, well, what's a revelation?\n\n2:12:04.340 --> 2:12:08.620\n Well, if you ask yourself a question, it's a real question.\n\n2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:10.340\n Do you get an answer or not?\n\n2:12:10.340 --> 2:12:11.660\n And the answer is, well, yeah,\n\n2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:14.020\n thoughts start to appear in your head.\n\n2:12:14.020 --> 2:12:14.860\n So...\n\n2:12:14.860 --> 2:12:15.700\n From somewhere.\n\n2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:16.540\n That's right, from somewhere.\n\n2:12:16.540 --> 2:12:17.740\n Where do they come from?\n\n2:12:17.740 --> 2:12:19.300\n Do you have a sense?\n\n2:12:19.300 --> 2:12:21.620\n Depends on what you're aiming at.\n\n2:12:21.620 --> 2:12:23.260\n Depends on the question.\n\n2:12:23.260 --> 2:12:26.300\n No, no, it does to some degree.\n\n2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:29.060\n It depends on your intent.\n\n2:12:29.060 --> 2:12:32.540\n So imagine that your intent is to make things better.\n\n2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:35.340\n Then maybe they come from the place\n\n2:12:35.340 --> 2:12:37.300\n that's designed to make things better.\n\n2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:39.820\n Maybe your intent is to make things worse.\n\n2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:41.340\n Then they come from hell.\n\n2:12:42.300 --> 2:12:43.420\n And you think, not really.\n\n2:12:43.420 --> 2:12:45.940\n It's like, you're so sure about that, are you?\n\n2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:47.380\n Is your intent conscious?\n\n2:12:47.380 --> 2:12:49.660\n Like, are you able to introspect with the intent?\n\n2:12:49.660 --> 2:12:51.740\n Conscious and habitual, right?\n\n2:12:51.740 --> 2:12:54.060\n Because as you practise something consciously,\n\n2:12:54.060 --> 2:12:55.300\n it becomes habitual.\n\n2:12:55.300 --> 2:12:56.220\n But it's conscious.\n\n2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:59.620\n It's like when I sit down before I do a lecture,\n\n2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:01.700\n I think, okay, what's the goal here?\n\n2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:04.140\n To do the best job I can.\n\n2:13:04.140 --> 2:13:05.100\n To what end?\n\n2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:08.540\n Well, people are coming here not for political issues.\n\n2:13:08.540 --> 2:13:09.740\n They're coming here because they're trying\n\n2:13:09.740 --> 2:13:11.780\n to make their lives better.\n\n2:13:11.780 --> 2:13:13.020\n Okay, so what are we doing?\n\n2:13:13.020 --> 2:13:14.940\n We're conducting a joint investigation\n\n2:13:14.940 --> 2:13:17.500\n into the nature of that which makes life better.\n\n2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:18.740\n Okay, what's my role?\n\n2:13:18.740 --> 2:13:21.780\n To do as good a job about that as possible.\n\n2:13:21.780 --> 2:13:23.620\n What state of mind do I have to be in?\n\n2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:25.980\n Am I annoyed about the theatre?\n\n2:13:25.980 --> 2:13:30.260\n Or am I clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people\n\n2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.620\n have showed up at substantial expense and trouble\n\n2:13:33.620 --> 2:13:35.420\n to come and listen to me talk?\n\n2:13:35.420 --> 2:13:36.940\n And if I'm not in that state of mind,\n\n2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:38.380\n I think, well, maybe I need something to eat\n\n2:13:38.380 --> 2:13:39.900\n or maybe I need to talk to someone\n\n2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:44.460\n because ingratitude is no place to start.\n\n2:13:44.460 --> 2:13:48.180\n It's like, I should be thrilled to be there, obviously.\n\n2:13:48.180 --> 2:13:50.260\n And so that orientation has to be there.\n\n2:13:50.260 --> 2:13:51.460\n And then I, is it conscious?\n\n2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:52.740\n All this is conscious.\n\n2:13:52.740 --> 2:13:53.860\n What am I serving?\n\n2:13:53.860 --> 2:13:55.780\n The highest good I can conceptualize.\n\n2:13:55.780 --> 2:13:56.900\n What is that?\n\n2:13:56.900 --> 2:13:58.700\n I have some sense, but I don't know it\n\n2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:01.540\n in the final analysis, which is why the investigation\n\n2:14:01.540 --> 2:14:02.620\n is being conducted.\n\n2:14:02.620 --> 2:14:03.660\n Who's doing it?\n\n2:14:03.660 --> 2:14:07.820\n Me, whoever I'm communing with, and the audience.\n\n2:14:07.820 --> 2:14:11.140\n And so I try to get myself and I chase everybody away\n\n2:14:11.140 --> 2:14:13.500\n for that, it's like I have to do that by myself.\n\n2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.900\n Are you writing stuff down?\n\n2:14:14.900 --> 2:14:19.300\n Yes, at that point, I just make point notes.\n\n2:14:19.300 --> 2:14:21.980\n And it's usually about maybe 30 notes.\n\n2:14:21.980 --> 2:14:24.220\n But then I, on stage, I never refer to them.\n\n2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:27.740\n And I often don't even use the structure that I laid out.\n\n2:14:27.740 --> 2:14:29.300\n Kind of an interesting thing.\n\n2:14:29.300 --> 2:14:31.460\n From where do powerful phrases come from?\n\n2:14:31.460 --> 2:14:35.820\n Do you have a, do you try to encapsulate an idea\n\n2:14:35.820 --> 2:14:38.420\n into a sentence or two?\n\n2:14:38.420 --> 2:14:42.620\n Well, when I talk, and I've practiced this since,\n\n2:14:42.620 --> 2:14:47.620\n consciously, since 1985, I try to feel\n\n2:14:48.860 --> 2:14:52.140\n and see if the words are stepping stones\n\n2:14:52.140 --> 2:14:53.860\n or foundation stones, right?\n\n2:14:53.860 --> 2:14:55.260\n It's like, is this solid?\n\n2:14:55.260 --> 2:14:56.500\n Is this word solid?\n\n2:14:56.500 --> 2:14:57.860\n Is this phrase solid?\n\n2:14:57.860 --> 2:14:59.660\n Is this sentence solid?\n\n2:14:59.660 --> 2:15:04.180\n It's a real sense of fundamental foundation\n\n2:15:04.180 --> 2:15:05.100\n under each word.\n\n2:15:05.100 --> 2:15:08.220\n And I suppose people ask me if I pray.\n\n2:15:08.220 --> 2:15:13.220\n And I would say, I pray before every word.\n\n2:15:14.220 --> 2:15:16.300\n Well, when you're asking questions,\n\n2:15:16.300 --> 2:15:21.220\n like you're very clear headed and present\n\n2:15:21.220 --> 2:15:25.500\n in your ability to ask questions and inquire.\n\n2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:27.300\n So how do you do that?\n\n2:15:27.300 --> 2:15:32.300\n So first of all, I'm worried that my mind\n\n2:15:32.300 --> 2:15:37.300\n easily gets trapped when I step on a word\n\n2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:41.860\n and I know it's unstable.\n\n2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:45.380\n You kind of realize that you don't really know\n\n2:15:45.380 --> 2:15:47.900\n the definitions of many words you use.\n\n2:15:47.900 --> 2:15:51.540\n And that can be debilitating.\n\n2:15:52.660 --> 2:15:56.620\n So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.\n\n2:15:57.580 --> 2:15:59.180\n Because otherwise you get trapped.\n\n2:15:59.180 --> 2:16:00.860\n You don't want to be obsessional.\n\n2:16:00.860 --> 2:16:04.860\n Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence\n\n2:16:04.860 --> 2:16:08.620\n will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?\n\n2:16:08.620 --> 2:16:09.620\n Right, right, right.\n\n2:16:09.620 --> 2:16:10.460\n Well, you know, neurologically.\n\n2:16:10.460 --> 2:16:12.580\n And then everything else just explodes.\n\n2:16:12.580 --> 2:16:14.660\n Your big picture idea explodes\n\n2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:17.380\n and you lost yourself in the minutiae.\n\n2:16:17.380 --> 2:16:21.860\n Well, neurologically, there's a production center\n\n2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:23.780\n and an editing center.\n\n2:16:23.780 --> 2:16:27.180\n And those can be separately affected by strokes.\n\n2:16:27.180 --> 2:16:30.380\n And so often when people are writing or talking,\n\n2:16:30.380 --> 2:16:33.100\n they try to activate both at the same time.\n\n2:16:33.100 --> 2:16:35.700\n And that's, so people will try to write an essay\n\n2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:37.500\n and get every sentence right in the first draft.\n\n2:16:37.500 --> 2:16:38.940\n That's a big mistake.\n\n2:16:38.940 --> 2:16:40.020\n And so then you might say, well,\n\n2:16:40.020 --> 2:16:42.780\n how can you be careful with your words, but carefree?\n\n2:16:42.780 --> 2:16:46.180\n And the answer is orient yourself properly, right?\n\n2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:48.260\n While in the conversation we're having,\n\n2:16:48.260 --> 2:16:50.020\n you have an orientation structure.\n\n2:16:50.020 --> 2:16:52.020\n You want to be prepared.\n\n2:16:52.020 --> 2:16:53.860\n You want to be attentive.\n\n2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:56.300\n Then you want to have an interesting conversation.\n\n2:16:56.300 --> 2:16:58.340\n And you want to have the kind of interesting conversation\n\n2:16:58.340 --> 2:17:01.500\n that other people want to listen to.\n\n2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:04.460\n That will be good for them in some manner.\n\n2:17:04.460 --> 2:17:06.300\n Okay, so that's pretty good frame.\n\n2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:09.180\n And then you kind of scour your heart\n\n2:17:09.180 --> 2:17:10.780\n and you think, is that really what you want?\n\n2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:12.820\n Are you after fame or after notoriety?\n\n2:17:12.820 --> 2:17:14.180\n Are you after money?\n\n2:17:14.180 --> 2:17:17.740\n I'm not saying any of those things are necessarily bad,\n\n2:17:17.740 --> 2:17:20.020\n but they're not optimal,\n\n2:17:20.020 --> 2:17:22.820\n especially if you're not willing to admit them, right?\n\n2:17:22.820 --> 2:17:24.620\n And so they can contaminate you.\n\n2:17:24.620 --> 2:17:26.780\n So you want to be decontaminated.\n\n2:17:26.780 --> 2:17:29.500\n So you have the right trip, let's say.\n\n2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.900\n And so you have to put yourself,\n\n2:17:31.900 --> 2:17:33.100\n that's a meditative practice.\n\n2:17:33.100 --> 2:17:36.620\n You have to put yourself in the right receptive position\n\n2:17:36.620 --> 2:17:38.140\n with the right goal in mind.\n\n2:17:38.140 --> 2:17:39.980\n Then you can,\n\n2:17:41.380 --> 2:17:43.340\n and I think you can get better and better at this,\n\n2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:47.300\n then you can trust what's going to happen.\n\n2:17:47.300 --> 2:17:49.620\n You know, so for example, before I came here,\n\n2:17:50.820 --> 2:17:52.780\n I mean, I presume you have a reason\n\n2:17:52.780 --> 2:17:55.780\n for doing the podcast with me.\n\n2:17:55.780 --> 2:17:56.820\n What's the reason?\n\n2:17:59.980 --> 2:18:03.060\n I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time.\n\n2:18:03.060 --> 2:18:04.540\n So the reason has evolved.\n\n2:18:07.380 --> 2:18:12.220\n One of the reasons is I've listened to you\n\n2:18:12.220 --> 2:18:13.220\n for quite a long time.\n\n2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:15.540\n So you've become a one way friend\n\n2:18:15.540 --> 2:18:17.660\n and I have many one way friends.\n\n2:18:17.660 --> 2:18:20.220\n Some of my best friends don't even know I exist.\n\n2:18:21.300 --> 2:18:24.020\n So I'm a big fan of podcasts and audio books.\n\n2:18:24.020 --> 2:18:26.060\n Actually, most of my friends are dead.\n\n2:18:26.060 --> 2:18:26.900\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:28.860\n The writers.\n\n2:18:28.860 --> 2:18:30.140\n The definition of a reader.\n\n2:18:32.140 --> 2:18:34.380\n It's a lot of dead, great dead friends.\n\n2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:37.460\n So I wanted to meet this one way friend, I suppose,\n\n2:18:37.460 --> 2:18:39.420\n and have a conversation.\n\n2:18:39.420 --> 2:18:42.420\n And then there's this kind of puzzle\n\n2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:44.020\n that I've been longing to solve.\n\n2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:46.460\n The same reason I went to Ukraine\n\n2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:50.500\n of asking this question of myself, who am I?\n\n2:18:50.500 --> 2:18:52.980\n And what was this part of the world?\n\n2:18:52.980 --> 2:18:56.260\n What is this thing that happened in the 20th century?\n\n2:18:56.260 --> 2:18:59.420\n That I lost so much of my family there\n\n2:18:59.420 --> 2:19:03.540\n and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place.\n\n2:19:03.540 --> 2:19:06.860\n Now that place includes the Soviet Union\n\n2:19:06.860 --> 2:19:09.620\n and it includes Russia and Ukraine.\n\n2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:11.100\n It includes Nazi Germany,\n\n2:19:11.100 --> 2:19:14.580\n includes these big powerful leaders\n\n2:19:14.580 --> 2:19:19.580\n and huge millions of people that were lost in the beauty,\n\n2:19:19.580 --> 2:19:24.580\n the power of the dream, but were also the torture\n\n2:19:25.460 --> 2:19:28.220\n that was forced onto them\n\n2:19:28.220 --> 2:19:32.460\n through different governmental institutions.\n\n2:19:32.460 --> 2:19:36.340\n And you are somebody that seemed from some angle\n\n2:19:36.340 --> 2:19:41.340\n to also be drawn to try to understand what was that.\n\n2:19:41.340 --> 2:19:43.820\n And not in some sort of historical sense,\n\n2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:46.500\n but in a deeply psychological human sense.\n\n2:19:46.500 --> 2:19:47.340\n What is that?\n\n2:19:47.340 --> 2:19:49.700\n What is that, will it repeat again?\n\n2:19:49.700 --> 2:19:51.700\n In what way is it repeating again?\n\n2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:53.060\n And how can we stop it?\n\n2:19:53.060 --> 2:19:54.100\n And how can we stop it?\n\n2:19:54.100 --> 2:19:55.580\n And so. That's the crucial issue.\n\n2:19:55.580 --> 2:20:00.060\n I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds,\n\n2:20:01.940 --> 2:20:04.180\n pull at the thread of that curiosity.\n\n2:20:04.180 --> 2:20:08.580\n You know, I'm an engineer, you're a psychologist,\n\n2:20:08.580 --> 2:20:12.580\n both lost in that curiosity and both wear suits.\n\n2:20:12.580 --> 2:20:17.020\n And a talk with various levels of eloquence\n\n2:20:18.700 --> 2:20:23.580\n about sort of the shadows that these,\n\n2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:28.580\n that history casts on us.\n\n2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:30.340\n And so that was one.\n\n2:20:30.340 --> 2:20:31.580\n And also the psychology,\n\n2:20:31.580 --> 2:20:33.660\n I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.\n\n2:20:33.660 --> 2:20:37.620\n I was fascinated by the human mind\n\n2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:41.060\n until I discovered artificial intelligence,\n\n2:20:41.060 --> 2:20:44.180\n the fact that I could program and make a robot move.\n\n2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:47.660\n And until I discovered that magic,\n\n2:20:47.660 --> 2:20:50.020\n I thought I wanted to understand the human mind\n\n2:20:50.020 --> 2:20:52.060\n by being psychiatrist, by talking to people,\n\n2:20:52.060 --> 2:20:55.020\n by to talk therapy, psychotherapy.\n\n2:20:55.020 --> 2:20:56.700\n So now you've got the best of both worlds\n\n2:20:56.700 --> 2:20:59.740\n because you get to talk to people and you get build robots.\n\n2:20:59.740 --> 2:21:03.580\n Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot.\n\n2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:05.860\n That I felt like by building the thing,\n\n2:21:05.860 --> 2:21:08.380\n can you start to try to understand it.\n\n2:21:08.380 --> 2:21:09.460\n That's one way.\n\n2:21:09.460 --> 2:21:12.540\n I mean, we all have different skills and proclivities.\n\n2:21:12.540 --> 2:21:17.540\n So like my particular one is, has to do with,\n\n2:21:20.100 --> 2:21:22.100\n I learned by building.\n\n2:21:22.100 --> 2:21:25.580\n I think through a thing by building it.\n\n2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:27.620\n And programming is a wonderful thing\n\n2:21:27.620 --> 2:21:30.620\n because it allows you to like build a little toy example.\n\n2:21:30.620 --> 2:21:33.780\n So in the same way you can do a little thought experiment,\n\n2:21:33.780 --> 2:21:35.740\n programming allows you to create a thought experiment\n\n2:21:35.740 --> 2:21:38.740\n in action, it can move, it can live, it can,\n\n2:21:38.740 --> 2:21:40.220\n and then you can ask questions of it.\n\n2:21:40.220 --> 2:21:44.940\n So all of those, because of my interest in Freud and Young,\n\n2:21:46.820 --> 2:21:49.820\n you're also in different ways,\n\n2:21:49.820 --> 2:21:54.820\n have delved deeply into humanity, the human psyche\n\n2:21:56.660 --> 2:22:00.260\n through the perspective of those psychologists.\n\n2:22:00.260 --> 2:22:04.380\n So for all those reasons, I thought our paths were crossed.\n\n2:22:04.380 --> 2:22:07.460\n Yeah, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?\n\n2:22:07.460 --> 2:22:09.820\n You had all sorts of reasons, and then you think,\n\n2:22:09.820 --> 2:22:12.300\n well, are you just letting the conversation\n\n2:22:12.300 --> 2:22:13.140\n go where it will?\n\n2:22:13.140 --> 2:22:15.420\n It's like, well, not exactly.\n\n2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:17.780\n You spent all this time,\n\n2:22:17.780 --> 2:22:19.780\n it's not like this came about by accident,\n\n2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:22.980\n this conversation, you spent all this time framing it.\n\n2:22:22.980 --> 2:22:26.740\n And so all of that provides the implicit substructure\n\n2:22:26.740 --> 2:22:28.540\n for the play in the conversation.\n\n2:22:28.540 --> 2:22:31.420\n And if you have that implicit, here's another way,\n\n2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:34.220\n this is very much worth knowing is,\n\n2:22:34.220 --> 2:22:36.860\n if you get the implicit structure of perception right,\n\n2:22:36.860 --> 2:22:39.060\n everything becomes a game.\n\n2:22:40.500 --> 2:22:42.220\n And not only that, a game you wanna play,\n\n2:22:42.220 --> 2:22:44.020\n and maybe in the final analysis,\n\n2:22:44.020 --> 2:22:45.780\n a game you'd wanna play forever.\n\n2:22:47.020 --> 2:22:52.020\n So that's obviously a distant beckoning ideal,\n\n2:22:52.140 --> 2:22:57.140\n but we know only games need rules, or there's no play.\n\n2:22:58.260 --> 2:23:03.100\n Is there advice you can give, now that we know the frame,\n\n2:23:03.100 --> 2:23:08.100\n to give to me, Lex, about how to do this podcast better,\n\n2:23:09.500 --> 2:23:14.500\n how to think about this world,\n\n2:23:17.940 --> 2:23:19.860\n how to be a good engineer,\n\n2:23:20.900 --> 2:23:25.460\n how to be a good human being, from what you know about me.\n\n2:23:25.460 --> 2:23:28.180\n Take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.\n\n2:23:28.180 --> 2:23:32.660\n It's a serious business, right?\n\n2:23:32.660 --> 2:23:34.380\n And that's part of that,\n\n2:23:34.380 --> 2:23:37.060\n to circle back to the beginning, let's say,\n\n2:23:37.060 --> 2:23:39.260\n that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss,\n\n2:23:39.260 --> 2:23:40.780\n which is obviously what you were doing\n\n2:23:40.780 --> 2:23:42.620\n when you went to Ukraine.\n\n2:23:42.620 --> 2:23:47.620\n It's like, it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better.\n\n2:23:47.620 --> 2:23:51.380\n The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's ideas,\n\n2:23:51.380 --> 2:23:54.500\n not as differentiated as it became,\n\n2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:57.780\n sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed\n\n2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:01.740\n towards the abyss, and then you're traumatized.\n\n2:24:01.740 --> 2:24:04.900\n If it's involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.\n\n2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:10.860\n The more it's voluntary, the more transformative it is.\n\n2:24:11.660 --> 2:24:14.900\n And that's part of that idea about facing death and hell.\n\n2:24:14.900 --> 2:24:18.140\n It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?\n\n2:24:18.140 --> 2:24:21.340\n And the answer is, this terrible answer is,\n\n2:24:21.340 --> 2:24:26.340\n yes, to the degree that you're willing to do it voluntarily.\n\n2:24:27.620 --> 2:24:29.420\n And then you might ask, well,\n\n2:24:29.420 --> 2:24:33.460\n why should I have to subject myself to death and hell?\n\n2:24:33.460 --> 2:24:35.060\n I'm innocent.\n\n2:24:35.060 --> 2:24:36.980\n And then the answer to that is,\n\n2:24:40.980 --> 2:24:43.940\n even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed\n\n2:24:43.940 --> 2:24:44.940\n to the highest good.\n\n2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:48.940\n Even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed to the highest good.\n\n2:24:54.340 --> 2:24:56.380\n That's such an interesting distinction.\n\n2:24:58.700 --> 2:24:59.780\n Voluntary suffering.\n\n2:24:59.780 --> 2:25:01.940\n Voluntary, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:04.900\n Well, that's why the central Christian doctrine is,\n\n2:25:04.900 --> 2:25:06.980\n pick up your cross and follow me.\n\n2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:11.740\n And I'm speaking, not in religious terms saying that,\n\n2:25:11.740 --> 2:25:13.580\n I'm just speaking as a psychologist.\n\n2:25:13.580 --> 2:25:15.300\n It's like one of the things we've learned\n\n2:25:15.300 --> 2:25:19.260\n in the last 100 years is voluntary exposure to that\n\n2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:22.100\n which freezes and terrifies you\n\n2:25:22.100 --> 2:25:25.220\n in measured proportions is curative.\n\n2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:30.220\n So a form of, at least in part,\n\n2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:32.460\n involuntary suffering is depression.\n\n2:25:34.940 --> 2:25:38.860\n Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?\n\n2:25:40.300 --> 2:25:43.460\n You're a man who has suffered in this way.\n\n2:25:43.460 --> 2:25:46.140\n Perhaps continue to suffer in this way.\n\n2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:47.660\n How do you find a way out?\n\n2:25:51.780 --> 2:25:53.620\n The first thing I do as a clinician,\n\n2:25:53.620 --> 2:25:55.700\n if someone comes to me and says they're depressed\n\n2:25:55.700 --> 2:25:57.340\n is ask myself a question.\n\n2:25:58.420 --> 2:26:00.460\n Well, what does this person mean by that?\n\n2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:02.340\n So I have to find out like,\n\n2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:03.620\n because maybe they're not depressed,\n\n2:26:03.620 --> 2:26:05.100\n maybe they're hyper anxious,\n\n2:26:05.100 --> 2:26:06.820\n or maybe they're obsessional.\n\n2:26:06.820 --> 2:26:10.380\n Like there's various forms of powerful negative emotion.\n\n2:26:10.380 --> 2:26:12.340\n So they need to be differentiated.\n\n2:26:12.340 --> 2:26:14.100\n But then the next question you have to ask is,\n\n2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:16.860\n well, are you depressed?\n\n2:26:16.860 --> 2:26:19.260\n Or do you have a terrible life?\n\n2:26:19.260 --> 2:26:21.820\n Or is it some combination of the two?\n\n2:26:21.820 --> 2:26:26.180\n So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell,\n\n2:26:26.180 --> 2:26:27.740\n you don't have a terrible life.\n\n2:26:29.100 --> 2:26:30.860\n You have friends, you have family,\n\n2:26:30.860 --> 2:26:32.140\n you have an intimate relationship,\n\n2:26:32.140 --> 2:26:33.660\n you have a job or a career,\n\n2:26:33.660 --> 2:26:35.380\n you're about as educated as you should be\n\n2:26:35.380 --> 2:26:36.820\n given your intelligence,\n\n2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:39.220\n use your time outside of work wisely,\n\n2:26:39.220 --> 2:26:42.620\n you're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations.\n\n2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:47.580\n You're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense,\n\n2:26:47.580 --> 2:26:49.420\n and all that's working.\n\n2:26:49.420 --> 2:26:52.580\n Now, if you have all that and you're feeling really awful,\n\n2:26:52.580 --> 2:26:54.900\n you're either ill or you're depressed.\n\n2:26:54.900 --> 2:26:57.740\n And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route\n\n2:26:57.740 --> 2:26:59.220\n to that treatment of that.\n\n2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:02.860\n My experience has been as a clinician is if you're depressed,\n\n2:27:02.860 --> 2:27:05.660\n but you have a life and you take an antidepressant,\n\n2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:07.220\n it will probably help you a lot.\n\n2:27:07.220 --> 2:27:09.780\n Now, maybe you're not depressed.\n\n2:27:09.780 --> 2:27:12.620\n Exactly, you just have a terrible life.\n\n2:27:12.620 --> 2:27:13.940\n What does that look like?\n\n2:27:15.820 --> 2:27:19.100\n You have no relationship, your family's a mess,\n\n2:27:19.100 --> 2:27:22.660\n you've got no friends, you've got no plan, you've got no job.\n\n2:27:23.540 --> 2:27:25.220\n You use your time outside of work\n\n2:27:25.220 --> 2:27:27.380\n not only badly but destructively.\n\n2:27:27.380 --> 2:27:29.700\n You have a drug or alcohol habit\n\n2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:32.660\n or some other vice, pornography addiction.\n\n2:27:33.660 --> 2:27:36.420\n You're completely unengaged in the surrounding community.\n\n2:27:36.420 --> 2:27:40.380\n You have no scaffolding whatsoever to support you\n\n2:27:40.380 --> 2:27:43.420\n in your current mode of being or you move forward.\n\n2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:47.820\n And then as a therapist, well, you do two things.\n\n2:27:47.820 --> 2:27:50.180\n Well, if it's depression per se,\n\n2:27:50.180 --> 2:27:52.900\n well, like I said, there's sometimes a biochemical route,\n\n2:27:52.900 --> 2:27:55.820\n a nutritional route, there's ways that can be addressed.\n\n2:27:55.820 --> 2:27:58.780\n It's probably physiological if you're, at least in part,\n\n2:27:58.780 --> 2:28:00.980\n if you're depressed, but you have an okay life.\n\n2:28:00.980 --> 2:28:03.020\n Sometimes it's conceptual.\n\n2:28:03.020 --> 2:28:05.860\n You can turn to dreams sometimes to help people.\n\n2:28:05.860 --> 2:28:09.100\n Cause dreams contain the seeds of the potential future.\n\n2:28:09.100 --> 2:28:11.460\n And if your person is a real good dreamer\n\n2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:13.900\n and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful.\n\n2:28:13.900 --> 2:28:16.860\n But that seems to be only true for more creative people.\n\n2:28:16.860 --> 2:28:18.820\n And for the people who just have a terrible life,\n\n2:28:18.820 --> 2:28:22.140\n it's like, okay, you have a terrible life.\n\n2:28:22.140 --> 2:28:26.180\n Well, let's pick a front.\n\n2:28:26.180 --> 2:28:29.380\n How about you need a friend?\n\n2:28:29.380 --> 2:28:32.460\n Like one sort of friend.\n\n2:28:32.460 --> 2:28:36.300\n Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?\n\n2:28:36.300 --> 2:28:38.780\n I'll have the person show me.\n\n2:28:38.780 --> 2:28:40.420\n So let's do it for a sec.\n\n2:28:40.420 --> 2:28:45.060\n So it's like this, hi, I'm Jordan, right?\n\n2:28:45.060 --> 2:28:46.780\n And people don't know how to do that.\n\n2:28:46.780 --> 2:28:49.100\n And then they can't even get the ball rolling.\n\n2:28:49.100 --> 2:28:51.340\n For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.\n\n2:28:51.340 --> 2:28:54.380\n Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish, you know?\n\n2:28:54.380 --> 2:28:56.940\n And there's these elementary social skills\n\n2:28:56.940 --> 2:28:59.780\n that hypothetically, if you were well cared for,\n\n2:28:59.780 --> 2:29:02.060\n you learned when you were like three\n\n2:29:02.060 --> 2:29:04.940\n and sometimes people have, I had lots of clients\n\n2:29:06.380 --> 2:29:09.940\n to whom no one ever paid any attention.\n\n2:29:09.940 --> 2:29:12.740\n And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.\n\n2:29:12.740 --> 2:29:14.020\n And some of that was just listening\n\n2:29:14.020 --> 2:29:17.620\n because they had 10,000 hours of conversations\n\n2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:19.260\n they never had with anyone.\n\n2:29:19.260 --> 2:29:21.620\n And they were all tangled up in their head.\n\n2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:24.940\n And they had to just, one client in particular,\n\n2:29:24.940 --> 2:29:28.500\n I worked with this person for 15 years.\n\n2:29:28.500 --> 2:29:33.260\n And what she wanted from me\n\n2:29:33.260 --> 2:29:36.420\n was for me just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes.\n\n2:29:36.420 --> 2:29:38.020\n It was very hard for me.\n\n2:29:38.020 --> 2:29:42.020\n And to just tell me what had happened to her.\n\n2:29:42.020 --> 2:29:44.980\n And then what happened at the end of the conversation,\n\n2:29:44.980 --> 2:29:48.100\n then I could discuss a bit with her.\n\n2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:50.300\n And then as we progressed through the years,\n\n2:29:50.300 --> 2:29:52.620\n the amount of time that we spent in discussion\n\n2:29:52.620 --> 2:29:55.220\n increased in proportion in the sessions\n\n2:29:55.220 --> 2:29:58.780\n until by the time we stopped seeing each other,\n\n2:29:58.780 --> 2:30:00.820\n when my clinical practice collapsed,\n\n2:30:02.580 --> 2:30:06.380\n we were talking about 80% of the time.\n\n2:30:06.380 --> 2:30:07.500\n But she literally,\n\n2:30:07.500 --> 2:30:09.980\n she'd never been attended to properly ever.\n\n2:30:09.980 --> 2:30:13.620\n And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?\n\n2:30:13.620 --> 2:30:16.380\n She hadn't been subjected to those flaming swords\n\n2:30:16.380 --> 2:30:19.380\n that separated the wheat from the chaff.\n\n2:30:19.380 --> 2:30:22.740\n And so you can do that in therapy.\n\n2:30:22.740 --> 2:30:25.420\n If you're listening and you're depressed,\n\n2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:28.340\n I would say if you can't find a therapist,\n\n2:30:28.340 --> 2:30:29.820\n and that's getting harder and harder\n\n2:30:29.820 --> 2:30:32.220\n because it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now\n\n2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:34.500\n because you have to agree with your clients,\n\n2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:37.420\n which is a terrible thing to do with them.\n\n2:30:37.420 --> 2:30:40.700\n Just like it's terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them.\n\n2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:44.060\n You could do the self authoring program online\n\n2:30:44.060 --> 2:30:46.580\n because it helps you write an autobiography.\n\n2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:48.100\n And so if you have memories\n\n2:30:48.100 --> 2:30:49.420\n that are more than 18 months old\n\n2:30:49.420 --> 2:30:51.580\n that bother you when you think them up,\n\n2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:54.340\n part of you is locked inside that.\n\n2:30:54.340 --> 2:30:59.340\n An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.\n\n2:30:59.780 --> 2:31:01.620\n That's a metaphorical way of thinking about,\n\n2:31:01.620 --> 2:31:04.140\n that's why it still has emotional significance.\n\n2:31:04.140 --> 2:31:06.780\n So you can write about your past experiences,\n\n2:31:06.780 --> 2:31:08.780\n but I would say wait for at least 18 months\n\n2:31:08.780 --> 2:31:10.500\n if something bad has happened to you.\n\n2:31:10.500 --> 2:31:12.100\n Because otherwise you just hurt yourself again\n\n2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:13.220\n by encountering it.\n\n2:31:14.180 --> 2:31:16.740\n You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.\n\n2:31:16.740 --> 2:31:18.940\n There's an analysis of faults and virtues,\n\n2:31:18.940 --> 2:31:20.060\n that's the present authoring.\n\n2:31:20.060 --> 2:31:23.700\n And then there's a guided writing exercise\n\n2:31:23.700 --> 2:31:25.980\n that helps you make a future plan.\n\n2:31:25.980 --> 2:31:30.460\n That's young men who do that could go to college,\n\n2:31:30.460 --> 2:31:32.500\n young men who do that, 90 minutes,\n\n2:31:32.500 --> 2:31:34.460\n just the future authoring, 90 minutes,\n\n2:31:34.460 --> 2:31:37.260\n they're 50% less likely to drop out.\n\n2:31:37.260 --> 2:31:38.900\n That's all it takes.\n\n2:31:38.900 --> 2:31:43.540\n So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud\n\n2:31:43.540 --> 2:31:46.300\n that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.\n\n2:31:46.300 --> 2:31:48.860\n Or you said isolate, make a friend.\n\n2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:52.060\n Oh man, sometimes the first step is extremely difficult.\n\n2:31:52.060 --> 2:31:54.940\n Oh my God, sometimes it's way worse than that.\n\n2:31:54.940 --> 2:31:57.100\n Like I had clients who were so depressed\n\n2:31:57.100 --> 2:31:59.060\n they literally couldn't get out of bed.\n\n2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:01.180\n So what's their first step?\n\n2:32:01.180 --> 2:32:05.940\n It's like, can you sit up once today?\n\n2:32:05.940 --> 2:32:06.780\n No.\n\n2:32:07.980 --> 2:32:10.620\n Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?\n\n2:32:10.620 --> 2:32:14.060\n Like you just, you scale back the dragon\n\n2:32:14.060 --> 2:32:16.980\n till you find one that's conquerable\n\n2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:18.140\n that moves you forward.\n\n2:32:18.140 --> 2:32:19.900\n There's a rubric for life.\n\n2:32:19.900 --> 2:32:23.180\n Scale back the dragons till you find one conquerable\n\n2:32:23.180 --> 2:32:25.900\n and it'll give you a little bit of goal.\n\n2:32:25.900 --> 2:32:27.300\n Commensurate with the struggle.\n\n2:32:27.300 --> 2:32:29.140\n But the plus side of that,\n\n2:32:29.140 --> 2:32:31.060\n cause that's, you think that God, that's depressing.\n\n2:32:31.060 --> 2:32:35.460\n You mean I have to start by sitting up?\n\n2:32:35.460 --> 2:32:37.740\n Well you do if you can't sit up.\n\n2:32:37.740 --> 2:32:39.380\n But the plus side of that is\n\n2:32:39.380 --> 2:32:40.980\n it's the Pareto distribution issue\n\n2:32:40.980 --> 2:32:45.860\n is that aggregates exponentially increase\n\n2:32:45.860 --> 2:32:47.980\n and failures do too by the way.\n\n2:32:47.980 --> 2:32:50.140\n But aggregates exponentially increase.\n\n2:32:50.140 --> 2:32:51.580\n So once you start the ball rolling\n\n2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:53.380\n it can get zipping along pretty good.\n\n2:32:53.380 --> 2:32:55.020\n This person that I talked about\n\n2:32:56.660 --> 2:33:00.460\n was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe\n\n2:33:00.460 --> 2:33:02.100\n when we first met just talking\n\n2:33:02.100 --> 2:33:04.180\n even though I was her therapist.\n\n2:33:04.180 --> 2:33:07.380\n But by the end she was doing standup comedy.\n\n2:33:08.300 --> 2:33:10.900\n So, you know, it took years,\n\n2:33:10.900 --> 2:33:14.020\n but still most people won't do standup comedy.\n\n2:33:14.020 --> 2:33:15.940\n That's quite the bloody achievement.\n\n2:33:15.940 --> 2:33:19.220\n She would read her poetry on stage too.\n\n2:33:20.100 --> 2:33:23.860\n So for someone who was petrified into paralysis\n\n2:33:23.860 --> 2:33:28.860\n by social anxiety and who had to start very small,\n\n2:33:29.060 --> 2:33:31.620\n it was a hell of an accomplishment.\n\n2:33:31.620 --> 2:33:33.940\n Yeah, it all starts with one step.\n\n2:33:33.940 --> 2:33:38.260\n Do you have advice for young people in high school?\n\n2:33:38.260 --> 2:33:40.580\n You've given, a lot of people look up to you\n\n2:33:40.580 --> 2:33:42.540\n for advice, for strength,\n\n2:33:42.540 --> 2:33:47.540\n for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves.\n\n2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:49.660\n Take on some responsibility.\n\n2:33:50.980 --> 2:33:53.220\n Do something for other people.\n\n2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:55.660\n You're doing something for yourself while you're doing that\n\n2:33:55.660 --> 2:33:57.780\n even if you don't know it, for sure.\n\n2:33:57.780 --> 2:34:00.220\n Cause you're a community across time.\n\n2:34:00.220 --> 2:34:02.540\n Find something to serve.\n\n2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:03.700\n Somebody to help.\n\n2:34:03.700 --> 2:34:06.980\n Someone to help, a job to, find a job,\n\n2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:08.900\n do your best with the customers.\n\n2:34:08.900 --> 2:34:10.220\n Don't be above your job.\n\n2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:12.780\n You're gonna get an entry level job when you're a kid\n\n2:34:12.780 --> 2:34:14.700\n or what else would you want?\n\n2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:15.540\n You wanna be the boss?\n\n2:34:15.540 --> 2:34:16.380\n What do you know?\n\n2:34:16.380 --> 2:34:17.780\n You don't know anything.\n\n2:34:17.780 --> 2:34:20.260\n You could be the boss of your job.\n\n2:34:20.260 --> 2:34:22.140\n You know, if you're working in a grocery store\n\n2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:23.380\n or you're working in a convenience store,\n\n2:34:23.380 --> 2:34:26.620\n assuming you're not working for terrified tyrants,\n\n2:34:26.620 --> 2:34:28.700\n you can be nice to the customers.\n\n2:34:28.700 --> 2:34:30.940\n You can develop your social skills.\n\n2:34:30.940 --> 2:34:34.140\n You can learn how to handle boss employee relationship.\n\n2:34:34.140 --> 2:34:37.780\n You can be there 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late.\n\n2:34:37.780 --> 2:34:40.340\n Like you can learn in an entry level job, man.\n\n2:34:40.340 --> 2:34:42.860\n And I'll tell you, if you take an entry level job\n\n2:34:42.860 --> 2:34:45.820\n and you learn and it's a reasonably decent place,\n\n2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:48.420\n you will not be in an entry level job for long\n\n2:34:48.420 --> 2:34:50.060\n because everyone who's competent\n\n2:34:50.060 --> 2:34:52.100\n is desperate for competent people.\n\n2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:54.140\n And if you go and show yourself as competent,\n\n2:34:54.140 --> 2:34:55.140\n there'll be a trial period.\n\n2:34:55.140 --> 2:34:57.140\n But if you go show yourself as competent,\n\n2:34:57.140 --> 2:34:59.260\n all sorts of doors you didn't even know were there\n\n2:34:59.260 --> 2:35:01.060\n will start opening like mad.\n\n2:35:01.060 --> 2:35:04.420\n So you strive for competence, for craftsmanship.\n\n2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:08.980\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, for discipline, you know, I mean,\n\n2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:11.020\n I said in one of the chapters,\n\n2:35:11.020 --> 2:35:14.180\n my books is focused on putting your house in order.\n\n2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:15.780\n It's like, well, how do you start?\n\n2:35:15.780 --> 2:35:16.700\n Make your bed.\n\n2:35:18.020 --> 2:35:21.540\n You know, it actually took me quite a long time in my life\n\n2:35:21.540 --> 2:35:23.580\n before I made my bed regularly in the morning.\n\n2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:25.380\n Most of my life was pretty good order,\n\n2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:27.700\n but that was one thing I didn't have in order.\n\n2:35:27.700 --> 2:35:31.060\n My clothes in my closet as well, all that's in order.\n\n2:35:31.060 --> 2:35:33.300\n Not all of it, I'm cleaning out some drawers right now,\n\n2:35:33.300 --> 2:35:37.980\n but look around and see what bugs you in your room.\n\n2:35:37.980 --> 2:35:39.180\n Just look.\n\n2:35:39.180 --> 2:35:40.940\n It's like, okay, I'm in my room.\n\n2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:41.900\n Do I like this room?\n\n2:35:41.900 --> 2:35:43.100\n No, it bugs me.\n\n2:35:43.100 --> 2:35:44.820\n Okay, why?\n\n2:35:44.820 --> 2:35:47.380\n Well, the paint's peeling there and it's dusty there\n\n2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:50.900\n and the carpet's dirty and that corner's kind of ugly\n\n2:35:50.900 --> 2:35:52.380\n and the light there isn't very good.\n\n2:35:52.380 --> 2:35:54.380\n And my clothes closet's a mess,\n\n2:35:54.380 --> 2:35:56.540\n so I don't even like to open it.\n\n2:35:56.540 --> 2:35:59.180\n Okay, that's a lot of problems.\n\n2:35:59.180 --> 2:36:00.380\n That sucks.\n\n2:36:00.380 --> 2:36:02.340\n That's a lot of opportunity.\n\n2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:04.300\n Pick something and fix it.\n\n2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:05.980\n Something that bugs you.\n\n2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:07.460\n Yeah, but not too much.\n\n2:36:07.460 --> 2:36:11.980\n So the rule is pick something you know would make,\n\n2:36:11.980 --> 2:36:14.900\n pick a problem, pick a solution to it\n\n2:36:14.900 --> 2:36:18.980\n that you know would help, that you could do,\n\n2:36:18.980 --> 2:36:20.740\n that you would do.\n\n2:36:20.740 --> 2:36:22.220\n So you have to negotiate with yourself.\n\n2:36:22.220 --> 2:36:23.860\n It's like, well, I won't clean up this room.\n\n2:36:23.860 --> 2:36:24.700\n How do you know?\n\n2:36:24.700 --> 2:36:27.060\n I've been in here for 10 years and I've never cleaned it up.\n\n2:36:27.060 --> 2:36:29.700\n It's like, well, obviously that's too big a dragon for you.\n\n2:36:29.700 --> 2:36:32.340\n Would you clean one drawer?\n\n2:36:32.340 --> 2:36:33.180\n Find out.\n\n2:36:34.020 --> 2:36:35.740\n And so imagine now you wanna be happy\n\n2:36:35.740 --> 2:36:37.140\n when you open that drawer and you think,\n\n2:36:37.140 --> 2:36:37.980\n well, that's stupid.\n\n2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:38.820\n It's like, is it?\n\n2:36:40.140 --> 2:36:41.580\n Maybe it's your sock drawer,\n\n2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:43.380\n which I cleaned up in my room the other day.\n\n2:36:43.380 --> 2:36:46.220\n By the way, you're gonna open that every morning.\n\n2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:50.820\n That's like 30 seconds of your life every day.\n\n2:36:50.820 --> 2:36:54.940\n Okay, so that's three minutes a week.\n\n2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:57.340\n That's 12 minutes a month.\n\n2:36:57.340 --> 2:36:59.580\n That's two hours a year.\n\n2:36:59.580 --> 2:37:01.140\n So maybe your life is made out of,\n\n2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:02.740\n you've got 16 hours a day.\n\n2:37:02.740 --> 2:37:03.660\n Let's figure this out.\n\n2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:08.660\n Five, 12 in an hour, 12 in an hour, 144 in 12 hours.\n\n2:37:09.180 --> 2:37:12.060\n Yeah, let's say 200, 205 minute chunks.\n\n2:37:12.060 --> 2:37:12.900\n That's your life.\n\n2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:15.300\n Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Peterson did just some math\n\n2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:17.460\n how many five minute chunks there are in a day.\n\n2:37:17.460 --> 2:37:19.300\n And I'm pretty sure it's pretty accurate.\n\n2:37:19.300 --> 2:37:20.620\n It's approximately right.\n\n2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:24.580\n So you got 205 minute chunks and they repeat.\n\n2:37:24.580 --> 2:37:26.380\n A lot of them repeat.\n\n2:37:26.380 --> 2:37:28.260\n So if you get every one of those right,\n\n2:37:28.260 --> 2:37:29.620\n they're trivial, right, who cares\n\n2:37:29.620 --> 2:37:30.740\n what my sock drawer looks like.\n\n2:37:30.740 --> 2:37:33.100\n It's like, fair enough, man, but that's your life.\n\n2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:36.820\n The things you repeat every day, the mundane things.\n\n2:37:36.820 --> 2:37:39.340\n Think I could get all those mundane things right.\n\n2:37:39.340 --> 2:37:40.620\n That's the game rules.\n\n2:37:40.620 --> 2:37:43.380\n It's like now all the mundane is in place.\n\n2:37:43.380 --> 2:37:45.900\n Now you can play because all the mundane is in place.\n\n2:37:45.900 --> 2:37:47.020\n And this is actually true.\n\n2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:51.020\n So with children, imagine you want your children to play.\n\n2:37:51.020 --> 2:37:53.660\n Well, play is very fragile neurologically.\n\n2:37:53.660 --> 2:37:57.340\n Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.\n\n2:37:57.340 --> 2:37:59.300\n So everything has to be in order.\n\n2:38:00.260 --> 2:38:02.060\n Everything has to be a walled garden\n\n2:38:02.060 --> 2:38:04.100\n before the children will play.\n\n2:38:04.100 --> 2:38:05.940\n That's a good way of thinking about it.\n\n2:38:05.940 --> 2:38:07.460\n So you put everything in order and you think,\n\n2:38:07.460 --> 2:38:09.540\n oh my God, now I'm tyrannized by this order.\n\n2:38:09.540 --> 2:38:12.540\n It's like, no, you aren't, not if it's voluntary.\n\n2:38:12.540 --> 2:38:15.700\n And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.\n\n2:38:15.700 --> 2:38:16.660\n And so then all of a sudden\n\n2:38:16.660 --> 2:38:17.940\n you get all these things in order.\n\n2:38:17.940 --> 2:38:19.340\n It's like, oh, look at this.\n\n2:38:19.340 --> 2:38:21.620\n I've got some room to play here.\n\n2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:24.820\n And then maybe you're not depressed.\n\n2:38:24.820 --> 2:38:26.580\n Now it's often not that simple.\n\n2:38:26.580 --> 2:38:28.620\n You know, it's not that simple.\n\n2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:31.060\n Try putting your room in order, perfect order.\n\n2:38:31.060 --> 2:38:31.900\n That's hard.\n\n2:38:31.900 --> 2:38:33.020\n I mean, it's a really powerful way\n\n2:38:33.020 --> 2:38:34.460\n to think about those five minute chunks.\n\n2:38:34.460 --> 2:38:36.620\n Just get one of them right in a day.\n\n2:38:36.620 --> 2:38:39.380\n Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days,\n\n2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:40.660\n your life is in order.\n\n2:38:41.940 --> 2:38:43.980\n You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.\n\n2:38:43.980 --> 2:38:45.500\n So a lot of them would come home from work,\n\n2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:47.940\n the guys, and their wives would meet them at the door\n\n2:38:47.940 --> 2:38:49.940\n and it'd be a fight right away.\n\n2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:51.140\n You know, and it's a clash there\n\n2:38:51.140 --> 2:38:53.300\n because he comes home and he's tired and hungry.\n\n2:38:53.300 --> 2:38:55.700\n He's worked all day and he's hoping that, you know,\n\n2:38:55.700 --> 2:38:57.980\n he gets welcomed when he comes back to the home,\n\n2:38:57.980 --> 2:38:59.820\n but then the wife is at home\n\n2:38:59.820 --> 2:39:01.060\n and she's been with the kids all day\n\n2:39:01.060 --> 2:39:02.660\n and she's tired and hungry and she's hoping\n\n2:39:02.660 --> 2:39:04.900\n that when he comes home, he'll show her some appreciation\n\n2:39:04.900 --> 2:39:05.820\n for what's happened today.\n\n2:39:05.820 --> 2:39:08.220\n And then they clash and then they both have problems\n\n2:39:08.220 --> 2:39:09.700\n to discuss because they've had their troubles\n\n2:39:09.700 --> 2:39:10.540\n during the day.\n\n2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:13.180\n And so then every time they get together,\n\n2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:16.300\n they're not like it's a bit of a fight for 20 minutes\n\n2:39:16.300 --> 2:39:18.900\n and then the whole evening is screwed.\n\n2:39:18.900 --> 2:39:21.820\n And so then you think, okay, here's the deal.\n\n2:39:23.060 --> 2:39:24.940\n It's knock and the door will open.\n\n2:39:24.940 --> 2:39:28.900\n Okay, you get to pick what happens when you come home,\n\n2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:30.180\n but you have to figure out what it is.\n\n2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:31.940\n So now this is the deal.\n\n2:39:31.940 --> 2:39:33.860\n You treat yourself properly.\n\n2:39:33.860 --> 2:39:35.300\n You imagine coming home\n\n2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:38.580\n and it goes the way you want and need it to go.\n\n2:39:38.580 --> 2:39:41.380\n Okay, what does that look like?\n\n2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:44.100\n You get to have it, but you have to know what it is.\n\n2:39:44.100 --> 2:39:45.980\n What does it look like?\n\n2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:48.020\n And you think, okay, I want to come home.\n\n2:39:48.020 --> 2:39:49.980\n I want to be happy about coming home.\n\n2:39:49.980 --> 2:39:53.540\n I come home, I open the door.\n\n2:39:53.540 --> 2:39:56.020\n I say, hello, honey, I'm home.\n\n2:39:56.020 --> 2:39:58.740\n My wife says, hi, it's so nice to hear your voice.\n\n2:39:58.740 --> 2:40:02.380\n She comes up, she says, hi, dear.\n\n2:40:02.380 --> 2:40:03.220\n She gives you a hug.\n\n2:40:03.220 --> 2:40:05.060\n She says, how was your day?\n\n2:40:05.060 --> 2:40:07.380\n And you say, well, we'll sit and talk about that.\n\n2:40:07.380 --> 2:40:08.660\n How was your day?\n\n2:40:08.660 --> 2:40:10.500\n Well, we'll sit and talk about that.\n\n2:40:10.500 --> 2:40:12.700\n Do you need something to eat?\n\n2:40:12.700 --> 2:40:16.220\n Probably, let's go sit and talk about our day.\n\n2:40:16.220 --> 2:40:18.100\n It's like, that sounds pretty good.\n\n2:40:18.100 --> 2:40:19.980\n Okay, that sounds pretty good.\n\n2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:20.820\n Might not be perfect,\n\n2:40:20.820 --> 2:40:21.940\n but sounds a hell of a lot better\n\n2:40:21.940 --> 2:40:23.180\n than what we're doing now.\n\n2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:26.220\n So how about we go talk to,\n\n2:40:26.220 --> 2:40:28.020\n we'll go talk to your wife and say,\n\n2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:31.020\n okay, this is what's happening when I come home.\n\n2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:32.700\n I would like it to be better.\n\n2:40:32.700 --> 2:40:34.500\n What would you like to have happened\n\n2:40:35.420 --> 2:40:37.220\n if you could have what you wanted?\n\n2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:39.220\n And so she sits down and she thinks,\n\n2:40:39.220 --> 2:40:41.500\n okay, if he comes home, what do I want to have happen?\n\n2:40:41.500 --> 2:40:44.180\n And then now you got two visions and you say,\n\n2:40:44.180 --> 2:40:45.140\n well, what would you like?\n\n2:40:45.140 --> 2:40:48.900\n And you listen and she says, what would you like?\n\n2:40:48.900 --> 2:40:50.540\n And you tell her, and then you think,\n\n2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:53.300\n okay, now how can we bring these visions together?\n\n2:40:53.300 --> 2:40:55.580\n So not only do we both get what we want,\n\n2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:57.020\n but because we've brought them together,\n\n2:40:57.020 --> 2:40:58.580\n we even get more than we want.\n\n2:40:58.580 --> 2:40:59.940\n Well, who wouldn't agree to that\n\n2:40:59.940 --> 2:41:01.860\n unless they were aiming down.\n\n2:41:01.860 --> 2:41:02.820\n And that's so exciting.\n\n2:41:02.820 --> 2:41:04.300\n It's not a compromise.\n\n2:41:04.300 --> 2:41:08.300\n It's a union of ideals that even makes a better ideal.\n\n2:41:08.300 --> 2:41:09.460\n And then you get to come home.\n\n2:41:09.460 --> 2:41:12.100\n And then there's another rule that goes along with that,\n\n2:41:12.100 --> 2:41:15.700\n which is, please, dear, have the grace\n\n2:41:16.660 --> 2:41:19.660\n to allow me to do this stupidly and badly\n\n2:41:19.660 --> 2:41:23.140\n while I learn at least 20 times.\n\n2:41:23.140 --> 2:41:25.940\n And I'll give you the same leeway,\n\n2:41:25.940 --> 2:41:28.900\n and then we'll practice stupidly for 20 times\n\n2:41:28.900 --> 2:41:30.500\n and we'll talk about it.\n\n2:41:30.500 --> 2:41:31.980\n And then maybe we'll get it right\n\n2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:35.460\n for the next 10,000 times, right?\n\n2:41:35.460 --> 2:41:37.860\n And you can do that with your whole life.\n\n2:41:37.860 --> 2:41:39.100\n And you can do that with your kids\n\n2:41:39.100 --> 2:41:40.860\n and you can do that with your family.\n\n2:41:40.860 --> 2:41:42.500\n Like it's not easy, but you can do it.\n\n2:41:42.500 --> 2:41:44.580\n It's a lot easier than the alternative.\n\n2:41:44.580 --> 2:41:47.540\n Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.\n\n2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:52.460\n How do you find on that topic the love of your life?\n\n2:41:52.460 --> 2:41:54.500\n That's a good question.\n\n2:41:54.500 --> 2:41:58.020\n I was asked that multiple times on my tour,\n\n2:41:58.020 --> 2:41:59.540\n three times in a row, in fact,\n\n2:41:59.540 --> 2:42:02.900\n because we ask people to use this Slido gadget.\n\n2:42:03.900 --> 2:42:05.060\n That's a popular question?\n\n2:42:05.060 --> 2:42:06.020\n To vary.\n\n2:42:06.020 --> 2:42:07.220\n It always came up to the top.\n\n2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:10.220\n And I got asked that three times in a row\n\n2:42:10.220 --> 2:42:11.700\n and I didn't have a good answer.\n\n2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:16.380\n And then I thought, why don't I have a good answer?\n\n2:42:16.380 --> 2:42:17.900\n I thought, oh, I know why.\n\n2:42:17.900 --> 2:42:19.700\n Cause that's a stupid question.\n\n2:42:19.700 --> 2:42:24.140\n So why?\n\n2:42:24.140 --> 2:42:25.420\n Why?\n\n2:42:25.420 --> 2:42:27.900\n Because it's putting the cart before the horse.\n\n2:42:27.900 --> 2:42:29.260\n Here's the right question.\n\n2:42:31.300 --> 2:42:33.500\n How do I make myself into the perfect date?\n\n2:42:34.860 --> 2:42:36.220\n You answer that question\n\n2:42:36.220 --> 2:42:37.820\n and you will not have any problem\n\n2:42:37.820 --> 2:42:39.140\n answering the previous question.\n\n2:42:39.140 --> 2:42:42.020\n It's like, what do I want in a partner?\n\n2:42:44.260 --> 2:42:46.300\n If I offered everything I could to a partner\n\n2:42:46.300 --> 2:42:47.940\n who would I be?\n\n2:42:47.940 --> 2:42:49.140\n You work on that.\n\n2:42:49.140 --> 2:42:49.980\n Ask that question.\n\n2:42:49.980 --> 2:42:50.820\n Just ask.\n\n2:42:50.820 --> 2:42:52.620\n Just ask yourself, okay.\n\n2:42:52.620 --> 2:42:57.540\n I have to be the person that women would want.\n\n2:42:59.420 --> 2:43:00.620\n Okay, what do they want?\n\n2:43:02.580 --> 2:43:03.820\n Clean.\n\n2:43:03.820 --> 2:43:05.300\n That's not a bad start.\n\n2:43:07.820 --> 2:43:09.740\n Reasonably good physical shape.\n\n2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:16.180\n So healthy, productive,\n\n2:43:16.180 --> 2:43:18.180\n generous, honest,\n\n2:43:19.860 --> 2:43:21.620\n willing to delay gratification.\n\n2:43:21.620 --> 2:43:22.820\n So you dance with a woman.\n\n2:43:22.820 --> 2:43:23.740\n It's like, what's she doing?\n\n2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:24.780\n What are you two doing?\n\n2:43:24.780 --> 2:43:26.540\n Well, it's a pattern.\n\n2:43:26.540 --> 2:43:28.060\n There's patterns happening around you.\n\n2:43:28.060 --> 2:43:30.340\n That's the music, patterns, patterns of being.\n\n2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:31.780\n That's the music.\n\n2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:32.940\n Now, can you align yourself\n\n2:43:32.940 --> 2:43:35.140\n with the patterns of being gracefully?\n\n2:43:35.140 --> 2:43:37.340\n That's what she's checking out.\n\n2:43:37.340 --> 2:43:40.380\n And then can you do that with her?\n\n2:43:41.500 --> 2:43:43.460\n And then can you do that in a playful\n\n2:43:43.460 --> 2:43:46.660\n and attentive manner and keep your bloody hands\n\n2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:48.620\n to yourself for at least a minute?\n\n2:43:49.620 --> 2:43:52.900\n And so can you dance in a playful manner?\n\n2:43:52.900 --> 2:43:55.300\n It's like, you can go through this in your imagination\n\n2:43:55.300 --> 2:43:58.020\n and you know, you'll know, you know.\n\n2:43:58.020 --> 2:44:00.340\n And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?\n\n2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:01.780\n And the answer is usually, man,\n\n2:44:01.780 --> 2:44:06.620\n it's pretty horrible abyss separating you from that ideal.\n\n2:44:06.620 --> 2:44:11.620\n But the harder you work on offering other people\n\n2:44:11.620 --> 2:44:13.820\n what they need and want,\n\n2:44:13.820 --> 2:44:16.660\n the more people will line up to play with you.\n\n2:44:16.660 --> 2:44:18.060\n And so it's the wrong question.\n\n2:44:18.060 --> 2:44:21.020\n It's like, how can I be the best partner possible?\n\n2:44:21.020 --> 2:44:22.460\n And then you think, well, if I do that,\n\n2:44:22.460 --> 2:44:25.020\n people will just take advantage of me.\n\n2:44:25.020 --> 2:44:28.860\n And that's the non naive objection, right?\n\n2:44:28.860 --> 2:44:30.620\n Because the naive person is saying, well, I'll be good\n\n2:44:30.620 --> 2:44:31.620\n and everyone will treat me right.\n\n2:44:31.620 --> 2:44:34.620\n It's like the cynic says, no, I'll be good\n\n2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:37.420\n and someone will take me out.\n\n2:44:38.500 --> 2:44:39.340\n And then you think, well,\n\n2:44:39.340 --> 2:44:42.020\n what do you do about that objection?\n\n2:44:42.020 --> 2:44:45.660\n And the answer is, well, you factor that in.\n\n2:44:45.660 --> 2:44:48.740\n And that's why you're supposed to be, what is it?\n\n2:44:48.740 --> 2:44:51.260\n As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.\n\n2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:54.300\n It's like, I know you're full of snakes.\n\n2:44:54.300 --> 2:44:55.700\n I know it.\n\n2:44:55.700 --> 2:45:00.620\n Maybe I know it more than you do, but we'll play anyways.\n\n2:45:00.620 --> 2:45:02.260\n And that's the risk anyway.\n\n2:45:02.260 --> 2:45:04.220\n That's right, voluntarily, right?\n\n2:45:04.220 --> 2:45:06.740\n It's like, and what's so cool about that\n\n2:45:06.740 --> 2:45:08.860\n is that even though the person you're dealing with\n\n2:45:08.860 --> 2:45:13.060\n is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust\n\n2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:16.940\n and it's real, you will evoke the best in them.\n\n2:45:16.940 --> 2:45:18.820\n And that's true even, I've dealt with people\n\n2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:23.820\n who are pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic\n\n2:45:25.220 --> 2:45:28.140\n and sometimes dangerously so.\n\n2:45:28.140 --> 2:45:30.100\n And you tread very lightly\n\n2:45:30.100 --> 2:45:31.660\n when you're dealing with someone like that,\n\n2:45:31.660 --> 2:45:33.900\n especially if they're intoxicated.\n\n2:45:33.900 --> 2:45:38.900\n And even then your best bet is that alert trust.\n\n2:45:42.780 --> 2:45:45.420\n It's the only, it's the fact that the only thing I know\n\n2:45:45.420 --> 2:45:49.060\n that I had one client who was a paranoid,\n\n2:45:49.060 --> 2:45:51.140\n he was paranoid psychopath.\n\n2:45:51.140 --> 2:45:52.980\n That's a bad combination.\n\n2:45:52.980 --> 2:45:54.420\n He was a bad guy, man.\n\n2:45:54.420 --> 2:45:57.940\n He had like four restraining orders on him\n\n2:45:57.940 --> 2:46:00.180\n and restraining orders don't work on the sort of people\n\n2:46:00.180 --> 2:46:02.860\n that you put restraining orders on.\n\n2:46:02.860 --> 2:46:06.660\n And he used to be harassed now and then by a bureaucrat\n\n2:46:06.660 --> 2:46:10.060\n in a bank with delusions of power.\n\n2:46:10.060 --> 2:46:13.140\n And he would say to them, he used to kind of act this out\n\n2:46:13.140 --> 2:46:14.860\n to me when I was talking to him.\n\n2:46:14.860 --> 2:46:19.340\n He'd say, I'm going to be your worst nightmare.\n\n2:46:20.300 --> 2:46:23.700\n And he meant it and he would do it.\n\n2:46:23.700 --> 2:46:27.620\n He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance\n\n2:46:27.620 --> 2:46:31.420\n that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt\n\n2:46:31.420 --> 2:46:34.060\n and paranoid people are hyper acute.\n\n2:46:34.060 --> 2:46:38.540\n So they're watching you for any sign of deceit\n\n2:46:38.540 --> 2:46:41.500\n or manipulation and they're really good at it.\n\n2:46:41.500 --> 2:46:44.380\n Cause like they're 100%, that's what paranoia is.\n\n2:46:44.380 --> 2:46:47.100\n It's 100% focus on that.\n\n2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:49.780\n And even under those circumstances,\n\n2:46:49.780 --> 2:46:54.420\n if you step carefully enough, you can,\n\n2:46:54.420 --> 2:46:57.140\n maybe you can avoid the ax.\n\n2:46:57.140 --> 2:46:59.020\n That's a good thing to know if you ever meet someone\n\n2:46:59.020 --> 2:47:01.580\n truly dangerous.\n\n2:47:01.580 --> 2:47:02.660\n Absolutely.\n\n2:47:02.660 --> 2:47:06.580\n I believe in that, that being fragile, nevertheless,\n\n2:47:06.580 --> 2:47:09.020\n taking that leap of trust towards another person,\n\n2:47:09.020 --> 2:47:10.140\n even when they're dangerous,\n\n2:47:10.140 --> 2:47:12.020\n especially when they're dangerous.\n\n2:47:12.020 --> 2:47:16.660\n If you care, if there's something there in those hills\n\n2:47:16.660 --> 2:47:20.540\n you want to find, then that's probably the only way\n\n2:47:20.540 --> 2:47:23.380\n you're going to find is taking that risk.\n\n2:47:23.380 --> 2:47:28.380\n I have to ask you about Gulag Archipelago by Solzhenitsyn.\n\n2:47:28.380 --> 2:47:30.340\n Let's speak to this very point.\n\n2:47:30.340 --> 2:47:31.760\n There's so many layers to this book.\n\n2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:33.980\n We could talk about it forever.\n\n2:47:33.980 --> 2:47:38.020\n I'm sure in many ways we are talking about it forever.\n\n2:47:38.020 --> 2:47:41.180\n But there is sort of one of the themes captured\n\n2:47:41.180 --> 2:47:43.260\n in the few ways that was described to the book\n\n2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:45.300\n is that line between good and evil\n\n2:47:45.300 --> 2:47:48.560\n that runs through every human being.\n\n2:47:48.560 --> 2:47:52.860\n As he writes, the line dividing good and evil\n\n2:47:52.860 --> 2:47:55.400\n cuts through the heart of every human being.\n\n2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:57.540\n During the life of any heart,\n\n2:47:57.540 --> 2:47:59.780\n this line keeps changing place.\n\n2:47:59.780 --> 2:48:03.540\n Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil,\n\n2:48:03.540 --> 2:48:06.120\n and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space\n\n2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:07.740\n for good to flourish.\n\n2:48:07.740 --> 2:48:10.880\n One and the same human being is, at various ages,\n\n2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:12.720\n under various circumstances,\n\n2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:15.020\n a totally different human being.\n\n2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:17.600\n At times he's close to being a devil,\n\n2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:20.040\n at times the sainthood.\n\n2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:22.100\n But his name doesn't change,\n\n2:48:22.100 --> 2:48:26.500\n and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.\n\n2:48:26.500 --> 2:48:27.740\n What do you think about this line?\n\n2:48:27.740 --> 2:48:29.340\n What do you think about this thing\n\n2:48:29.340 --> 2:48:31.820\n where we talked about if you give somebody a chance,\n\n2:48:31.820 --> 2:48:33.720\n you actually bring out the best in them?\n\n2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:36.420\n What do you think about this other aspect\n\n2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:41.420\n that throughout time that line shifts inside each person\n\n2:48:41.620 --> 2:48:43.660\n and you get to define that shift?\n\n2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:45.940\n What do you think about this line?\n\n2:48:45.940 --> 2:48:47.600\n Are we all capable of evil?\n\n2:48:48.700 --> 2:48:50.420\n Well, you know, the cosmic drama,\n\n2:48:50.420 --> 2:48:53.580\n that's Satan versus Christ.\n\n2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:55.700\n It's like, well, who's that about?\n\n2:48:55.700 --> 2:48:56.860\n If it's not about you?\n\n2:48:59.020 --> 2:49:01.500\n I'm speaking just as a psychologist\n\n2:49:01.500 --> 2:49:03.140\n or as a literary critic.\n\n2:49:03.140 --> 2:49:05.780\n Those are characters, at least they're that.\n\n2:49:06.660 --> 2:49:08.980\n Well, are they human characters?\n\n2:49:08.980 --> 2:49:10.660\n Well, obviously.\n\n2:49:10.660 --> 2:49:12.840\n Well, are they archetypal human characters?\n\n2:49:13.740 --> 2:49:14.680\n Yes.\n\n2:49:14.680 --> 2:49:18.460\n What does that mean cosmically and ontologically?\n\n2:49:18.460 --> 2:49:19.660\n I don't know.\n\n2:49:19.660 --> 2:49:21.060\n Like, is the world a story?\n\n2:49:22.460 --> 2:49:23.300\n Maybe.\n\n2:49:23.300 --> 2:49:24.640\n But the way stories are often told\n\n2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:27.180\n is the characters embody a stable.\n\n2:49:27.180 --> 2:49:30.420\n Those are unsophisticated, not great literature though.\n\n2:49:30.420 --> 2:49:32.180\n It's very rare in great literature.\n\n2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:33.940\n What you have in great literature generally\n\n2:49:33.940 --> 2:49:35.580\n is the internal drama, right?\n\n2:49:35.580 --> 2:49:40.580\n And as the literature becomes more pop, I would say,\n\n2:49:40.700 --> 2:49:42.940\n the characters are more unitary.\n\n2:49:42.940 --> 2:49:44.900\n So there's a real bad guy and he's all bad\n\n2:49:44.900 --> 2:49:47.940\n and there's a real good guy and he's all good.\n\n2:49:47.940 --> 2:49:49.660\n And that's not as interesting.\n\n2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:51.500\n It's not as sophisticated.\n\n2:49:51.500 --> 2:49:55.460\n When you reach Dostoevskian heights in literary representation\n\n2:49:55.460 --> 2:50:00.460\n or Shakespearean heights, you can identify with the villain.\n\n2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:05.420\n And that's when literature really reaches its pinnacle\n\n2:50:05.420 --> 2:50:06.500\n in some sense.\n\n2:50:06.500 --> 2:50:08.700\n And also the characters change throughout.\n\n2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:09.540\n They shift throughout.\n\n2:50:09.540 --> 2:50:11.340\n They're unpredictable throughout.\n\n2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:14.540\n Taking the speaking of Russian more seriously recently.\n\n2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:17.900\n And I've gotten to talk to translators of Dostoevsk and Tolstoy\n\n2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:22.180\n and Cherkov and those kinds of folks.\n\n2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:25.980\n And you get the, one of the mistakes that translators made\n\n2:50:25.980 --> 2:50:28.380\n with Dostoevsky for the longest time\n\n2:50:28.380 --> 2:50:33.260\n is they would, quote unquote, fix the chaotic mess\n\n2:50:33.260 --> 2:50:37.040\n that is Dostoevsky because there was a sense\n\n2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:39.960\n like he was too rushed in his writing.\n\n2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:41.660\n It seemed like there was tangents\n\n2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:43.580\n that had nothing to do with anything.\n\n2:50:43.580 --> 2:50:46.580\n The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.\n\n2:50:46.580 --> 2:50:49.460\n There's parts of phrases that seem to be incomplete,\n\n2:50:49.460 --> 2:50:50.500\n that kind of stuff.\n\n2:50:50.500 --> 2:50:53.100\n And what they realize that is, that's not,\n\n2:50:53.100 --> 2:50:55.260\n that's actually crafted that way.\n\n2:50:55.260 --> 2:50:58.580\n It's not, it's like editing James Joyce,\n\n2:50:58.580 --> 2:51:00.020\n like Finnegan's Wake or something\n\n2:51:00.020 --> 2:51:01.740\n because it doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:51:01.740 --> 2:51:03.700\n They realize that that is the magic of it.\n\n2:51:03.700 --> 2:51:05.960\n That captures the humanity of these characters,\n\n2:51:05.960 --> 2:51:07.100\n that they are unpredictable.\n\n2:51:07.100 --> 2:51:08.780\n They change throughout time.\n\n2:51:08.780 --> 2:51:11.220\n There's a bunch of contradictions.\n\n2:51:11.220 --> 2:51:13.900\n On which point I gotta ask, is there a case to be made\n\n2:51:13.900 --> 2:51:17.940\n that Brothers Karamazov is the greatest book I've ever written?\n\n2:51:17.940 --> 2:51:20.180\n Yeah, there is a case to be made for that.\n\n2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:23.020\n I don't know, is it better than Crime and Punishment?\n\n2:51:23.020 --> 2:51:23.980\n Yes, yeah.\n\n2:51:23.980 --> 2:51:24.860\n You think so?\n\n2:51:24.860 --> 2:51:26.740\n Why do you, I'm not arguing with it.\n\n2:51:26.740 --> 2:51:28.060\n Why do you think that?\n\n2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:30.420\n Well, every book is a person.\n\n2:51:30.420 --> 2:51:32.740\n Some of my best friends are inside that book.\n\n2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:34.060\n Yeah, it's an amazing book.\n\n2:51:34.060 --> 2:51:35.660\n I mean, there's no doubt about it.\n\n2:51:35.660 --> 2:51:39.900\n I think it's, some books are defined\n\n2:51:39.900 --> 2:51:41.340\n by your personal relationship with them.\n\n2:51:41.340 --> 2:51:44.620\n That one was definitive, and I almost graduated to that one\n\n2:51:44.620 --> 2:51:46.540\n because for the longest time,\n\n2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:51.300\n The Idiot was my favorite book of all,\n\n2:51:51.300 --> 2:51:53.980\n because I identified with the ideas\n\n2:51:53.980 --> 2:51:55.620\n represented by Prince Mishkin.\n\n2:51:55.620 --> 2:51:56.660\n I also identified.\n\n2:51:56.660 --> 2:51:58.140\n Ah, that's interesting.\n\n2:51:58.140 --> 2:52:00.500\n To Prince Mishkin as a human being.\n\n2:52:00.500 --> 2:52:01.540\n The holy fool.\n\n2:52:01.540 --> 2:52:04.500\n The fool, yeah, because the world kind of,\n\n2:52:04.500 --> 2:52:07.260\n my whole life still kind of sees me,\n\n2:52:07.260 --> 2:52:08.620\n saw me in my perception.\n\n2:52:08.620 --> 2:52:12.820\n My narrow perception is kind of the fool.\n\n2:52:12.820 --> 2:52:17.620\n And I, different from the interpretation\n\n2:52:17.620 --> 2:52:19.860\n that a lot of people take of this book,\n\n2:52:19.860 --> 2:52:22.180\n I see him as a kind of hero to be.\n\n2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:23.020\n Oh, definitely.\n\n2:52:23.020 --> 2:52:26.780\n To be a naive, quote unquote, fool,\n\n2:52:26.780 --> 2:52:29.900\n but really just a naive optimist,\n\n2:52:29.900 --> 2:52:31.780\n and naive in the best possible way.\n\n2:52:31.780 --> 2:52:33.180\n I do believe that.\n\n2:52:33.180 --> 2:52:34.540\n That's childlike?\n\n2:52:34.540 --> 2:52:36.260\n Yeah, childlike is a better.\n\n2:52:36.260 --> 2:52:38.460\n So naive is usually seen as.\n\n2:52:38.460 --> 2:52:39.700\n That's childish, naive.\n\n2:52:39.700 --> 2:52:42.660\n Yeah, but childlike.\n\n2:52:42.660 --> 2:52:45.340\n That's why no one enters the kingdom of heaven\n\n2:52:45.340 --> 2:52:48.060\n unless they become like a child.\n\n2:52:48.060 --> 2:52:49.260\n That's Prince Mishkin.\n\n2:52:49.260 --> 2:52:50.980\n Dostoevsky knew that.\n\n2:52:50.980 --> 2:52:52.340\n So that's why he liked The Idiot.\n\n2:52:52.340 --> 2:52:53.700\n That's so interesting.\n\n2:52:53.700 --> 2:52:55.420\n See, I think I like Crime and Punishment\n\n2:52:55.420 --> 2:52:57.260\n because while you identified with Mishkin,\n\n2:52:57.260 --> 2:52:59.780\n I think I identified more with Raskolnikov\n\n2:52:59.780 --> 2:53:02.060\n because I was tempted by a Luciferian intellect,\n\n2:53:02.060 --> 2:53:06.220\n you know, in a manner very similar\n\n2:53:06.220 --> 2:53:07.820\n to the manner he was tempted.\n\n2:53:07.820 --> 2:53:10.540\n But I mean, I think you can make a case\n\n2:53:10.540 --> 2:53:13.340\n that the Brothers Karamazov is Dostoevsky's\n\n2:53:13.340 --> 2:53:15.140\n crowning achievement.\n\n2:53:15.140 --> 2:53:15.980\n Well.\n\n2:53:15.980 --> 2:53:16.940\n And that's something, man.\n\n2:53:16.940 --> 2:53:18.540\n He ruined literature for me.\n\n2:53:20.300 --> 2:53:22.660\n Because everything else just felt insipid afterwards.\n\n2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:24.060\n Not everything.\n\n2:53:24.060 --> 2:53:25.420\n Not everything.\n\n2:53:25.420 --> 2:53:29.940\n I found some books that in my experience\n\n2:53:29.940 --> 2:53:31.940\n hit that pinnacle.\n\n2:53:31.940 --> 2:53:33.300\n The Master and Margarita.\n\n2:53:34.220 --> 2:53:35.380\n That's a deadly book.\n\n2:53:35.380 --> 2:53:36.900\n I've read that I think four times,\n\n2:53:36.900 --> 2:53:40.060\n and I still, there's still, it's unbelievably deep.\n\n2:53:41.060 --> 2:53:43.460\n There's a Nikos Kazantzakis, a Greek writer.\n\n2:53:44.420 --> 2:53:45.700\n Some of his books are,\n\n2:53:46.940 --> 2:53:48.860\n his writing is amazing as well.\n\n2:53:48.860 --> 2:53:50.860\n Did you ever connect with the literary,\n\n2:53:50.860 --> 2:53:55.820\n like existentialist Camus or people like Hermann Hesse\n\n2:53:55.820 --> 2:53:59.060\n or even Kafka?\n\n2:53:59.060 --> 2:54:00.340\n Did you ever connect with those?\n\n2:54:00.340 --> 2:54:01.340\n To the same degree?\n\n2:54:01.340 --> 2:54:02.180\n Yeah, to the same.\n\n2:54:02.180 --> 2:54:03.620\n Enough to be an influence.\n\n2:54:03.620 --> 2:54:07.300\n You know, you have to be deaf in some fundamental sense\n\n2:54:07.300 --> 2:54:12.020\n not to encounters a great dead friend and fail to learn.\n\n2:54:12.020 --> 2:54:14.700\n No, and I mean, I tried to separate the wheat\n\n2:54:14.700 --> 2:54:16.420\n from the chaff when I read.\n\n2:54:16.420 --> 2:54:18.340\n You know, and I read all the great clinicians,\n\n2:54:18.340 --> 2:54:20.180\n all of them, perhaps not.\n\n2:54:21.820 --> 2:54:24.180\n Those who are foremost in the pantheon.\n\n2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:25.980\n And I tried to pull out what I could,\n\n2:54:25.980 --> 2:54:26.900\n and that was a lot.\n\n2:54:26.900 --> 2:54:28.260\n I learned a lot from Freud.\n\n2:54:28.260 --> 2:54:30.100\n I learned a lot from Rogers.\n\n2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:31.380\n And I learned a lot from, well,\n\n2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:32.860\n from Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.\n\n2:54:32.860 --> 2:54:35.100\n I'm gonna do a course on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche\n\n2:54:35.100 --> 2:54:36.460\n for this Peterson Academy.\n\n2:54:36.460 --> 2:54:38.260\n This is coming up in January.\n\n2:54:38.260 --> 2:54:40.020\n Oh, that'll be them together.\n\n2:54:40.020 --> 2:54:40.860\n I'm really looking forward to it.\n\n2:54:40.860 --> 2:54:43.100\n You're weaving, I mean.\n\n2:54:43.100 --> 2:54:44.700\n I hadn't thought about doing them together.\n\n2:54:44.700 --> 2:54:45.540\n Oh.\n\n2:54:45.540 --> 2:54:46.380\n That'd be fun.\n\n2:54:46.380 --> 2:54:47.220\n That's a good idea.\n\n2:54:47.220 --> 2:54:48.060\n That'd be a good idea.\n\n2:54:48.060 --> 2:54:50.020\n Well, there's an interesting.\n\n2:54:50.020 --> 2:54:51.380\n I'm gonna steal that idea.\n\n2:54:51.380 --> 2:54:52.220\n I don't know.\n\n2:54:52.220 --> 2:54:54.420\n You often weave them together really masterfully\n\n2:54:54.420 --> 2:54:59.420\n because there is religious in the broad sense\n\n2:54:59.740 --> 2:55:02.060\n of that word, themes throughout the writing.\n\n2:55:02.060 --> 2:55:03.620\n Throughout the writing of both.\n\n2:55:03.620 --> 2:55:05.660\n Yeah, well, there's uncanny parallelisms\n\n2:55:05.660 --> 2:55:07.900\n in their writing and their lives.\n\n2:55:07.900 --> 2:55:12.180\n So, and Dostoevsky's deeper than Nietzsche,\n\n2:55:12.180 --> 2:55:15.580\n but that's because he was a writer of fiction.\n\n2:55:15.580 --> 2:55:18.060\n Nietzsche is almost a character in a Dostoevsky book.\n\n2:55:18.060 --> 2:55:19.620\n He is definitely that.\n\n2:55:19.620 --> 2:55:21.380\n He is definitely that, yes.\n\n2:55:22.340 --> 2:55:24.820\n And apparently Nietzsche knew more about Dostoevsky\n\n2:55:24.820 --> 2:55:25.740\n than people had thought.\n\n2:55:25.740 --> 2:55:27.940\n There's been some recent scholarship on that grounds.\n\n2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.780\n Dostoevsky didn't know anything about Nietzsche\n\n2:55:29.780 --> 2:55:30.900\n as far as I know.\n\n2:55:30.900 --> 2:55:32.340\n I could be wrong about that.\n\n2:55:32.340 --> 2:55:35.340\n But the thing that Dostoevsky had over Nietzsche\n\n2:55:35.340 --> 2:55:37.660\n is Nietzsche had to make things propositional\n\n2:55:37.660 --> 2:55:39.500\n in some real sense, cause he was a philosopher.\n\n2:55:39.500 --> 2:55:42.420\n And it's hard to propositionalize things\n\n2:55:42.420 --> 2:55:46.460\n that are outside your ken, but you can characterize them.\n\n2:55:46.460 --> 2:55:49.340\n And so in the Brothers Karamazov,\n\n2:55:49.340 --> 2:55:54.180\n Ivan is a more developed character than Eleosha.\n\n2:55:54.180 --> 2:55:58.060\n In the explicit sense, he can make better arguments.\n\n2:55:58.060 --> 2:56:02.820\n But Eleosha wins, like Mishkin, because he's the better man.\n\n2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:05.820\n And Dostoevsky can show that in the actions.\n\n2:56:06.860 --> 2:56:08.780\n He can't render it entirely propositional,\n\n2:56:08.780 --> 2:56:10.220\n but that's probably because what's good\n\n2:56:10.220 --> 2:56:12.700\n can't be rendered entirely propositional.\n\n2:56:12.700 --> 2:56:14.820\n And so Dostoevsky had that edge over Nietzsche.\n\n2:56:14.820 --> 2:56:17.420\n He said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist,\n\n2:56:17.420 --> 2:56:21.460\n atheist, materialist, and puts forward an argument\n\n2:56:21.460 --> 2:56:23.420\n on that front that's still unparalleled\n\n2:56:23.420 --> 2:56:25.020\n as far as I'm concerned.\n\n2:56:25.020 --> 2:56:27.980\n And overwhelms Eleosha, who cannot respond\n\n2:56:27.980 --> 2:56:30.820\n but Eleosha's still the better man.\n\n2:56:30.820 --> 2:56:33.740\n So, which is very interesting, you know, that.\n\n2:56:33.740 --> 2:56:35.820\n You know, the funny thing about those two characters\n\n2:56:35.820 --> 2:56:39.580\n is you, Jordan Peterson, seem to be somebody\n\n2:56:39.580 --> 2:56:42.500\n that at least in part embodies both.\n\n2:56:42.500 --> 2:56:45.660\n Because you are one of the intellectuals of our time,\n\n2:56:45.660 --> 2:56:49.540\n rigorous in thought, but also are able\n\n2:56:49.540 --> 2:56:52.740\n to have that kind of, what would you describe?\n\n2:56:52.740 --> 2:56:55.980\n If you remove the religiosity of Eleosha,\n\n2:56:55.980 --> 2:56:59.700\n there's a, what's a good word?\n\n2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:00.860\n Love towards the world.\n\n2:57:00.860 --> 2:57:02.940\n Spirit of encouragement.\n\n2:57:02.940 --> 2:57:04.420\n Yes.\n\n2:57:04.420 --> 2:57:05.260\n Which one?\n\n2:57:05.260 --> 2:57:06.700\n Yeah, well, it's, you know, one of the things\n\n2:57:06.700 --> 2:57:10.180\n I did learn, perhaps, from looking into the abyss\n\n2:57:10.180 --> 2:57:14.780\n to the degree that I have had to, or was willing to,\n\n2:57:16.060 --> 2:57:17.940\n was that at some level you have to make\n\n2:57:17.940 --> 2:57:20.500\n a fundamental statement of faith.\n\n2:57:20.500 --> 2:57:23.020\n When God creates the world, after each day,\n\n2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:26.540\n He says, He saw that it was good.\n\n2:57:26.540 --> 2:57:28.100\n You think, well, is it good?\n\n2:57:28.100 --> 2:57:29.900\n It's like, well, there's a tough question.\n\n2:57:29.900 --> 2:57:31.740\n I mean, you know, do you want to bring a child\n\n2:57:31.740 --> 2:57:35.020\n into a world such as this, which is a fundamental question\n\n2:57:35.020 --> 2:57:36.380\n of whether or not it's good.\n\n2:57:38.020 --> 2:57:41.220\n It's an act of faith to declare that it's good\n\n2:57:41.220 --> 2:57:43.140\n because the evidence is ambivalent.\n\n2:57:44.380 --> 2:57:46.300\n And so then you think, okay, well,\n\n2:57:47.900 --> 2:57:49.500\n am I gonna act as if it's good?\n\n2:57:49.500 --> 2:57:51.700\n And what would happen if I did?\n\n2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:55.380\n And maybe the answer to that is, I think this is the answer.\n\n2:58:02.100 --> 2:58:06.780\n The more you act out the proposition that it's good,\n\n2:58:06.780 --> 2:58:07.860\n the better it gets.\n\n2:58:09.620 --> 2:58:10.460\n And so that's it.\n\n2:58:10.460 --> 2:58:13.300\n Dostoevsky said, this is something else.\n\n2:58:13.300 --> 2:58:16.100\n Every man is not only responsible for everything he does,\n\n2:58:16.100 --> 2:58:18.100\n but for everything everyone else does.\n\n2:58:18.100 --> 2:58:23.020\n It's like, what is that profound, or are you just insane?\n\n2:58:23.020 --> 2:58:28.020\n Then you think, is what you receive back proportionate\n\n2:58:28.020 --> 2:58:28.940\n to what you deliver?\n\n2:58:30.060 --> 2:58:32.580\n And the answer to that might be yes.\n\n2:58:32.580 --> 2:58:34.860\n That's a terrifying idea, man.\n\n2:58:34.860 --> 2:58:37.500\n And it's certainly, you can see that it's true in some sense\n\n2:58:37.500 --> 2:58:42.500\n because people certainly respond to you in kind\n\n2:58:42.500 --> 2:58:43.820\n with how you treat them.\n\n2:58:43.820 --> 2:58:44.980\n That's certainly the case.\n\n2:58:44.980 --> 2:58:48.220\n I mean, it's terrifying and it's exciting.\n\n2:58:48.220 --> 2:58:49.060\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:58:49.940 --> 2:58:51.180\n But that's an adventure, isn't it?\n\n2:58:51.180 --> 2:58:56.180\n You, yeah, you create the world by the way you live it.\n\n2:58:59.340 --> 2:59:02.100\n The world you experience is defined by the way\n\n2:59:02.100 --> 2:59:03.340\n you live that world.\n\n2:59:03.340 --> 2:59:05.180\n And that's really interesting.\n\n2:59:05.180 --> 2:59:06.740\n And then taken as a collective,\n\n2:59:06.740 --> 2:59:09.140\n we create the world together in that way.\n\n2:59:09.140 --> 2:59:11.180\n What do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n2:59:11.180 --> 2:59:13.540\n What's the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?\n\n2:59:13.540 --> 2:59:16.100\n You've, we've defined it many, many times\n\n2:59:16.100 --> 2:59:16.940\n throughout this conversation.\n\n2:59:16.940 --> 2:59:18.900\n It's the adventure along the route, man.\n\n2:59:20.300 --> 2:59:24.900\n And I would say, where's that adventure to be found?\n\n2:59:24.900 --> 2:59:26.140\n In faith?\n\n2:59:26.140 --> 2:59:27.780\n What's the faith?\n\n2:59:27.780 --> 2:59:30.780\n The highest value is love and truth is its handmaiden.\n\n2:59:33.180 --> 2:59:34.700\n That's a statement of faith, right?\n\n2:59:34.700 --> 2:59:36.140\n Because you can't tell.\n\n2:59:37.500 --> 2:59:40.780\n You have to act it out to see if it's true.\n\n2:59:40.780 --> 2:59:41.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:59:41.620 --> 2:59:43.540\n If it's true. Yeah.\n\n2:59:43.540 --> 2:59:46.260\n And so you can't even find out without,\n\n2:59:46.260 --> 2:59:47.820\n and that's so peculiar.\n\n2:59:47.820 --> 2:59:50.340\n You have to make the commitment a priori.\n\n2:59:50.340 --> 2:59:51.540\n Yeah. It's like a marriage.\n\n2:59:51.540 --> 2:59:52.620\n It's the same thing.\n\n2:59:53.540 --> 2:59:56.420\n It's like, well, is this the person for me?\n\n2:59:56.420 --> 2:59:57.980\n Oh, that's the wrong question.\n\n2:59:59.340 --> 3:00:01.740\n How do I find out if this is the person for me?\n\n3:00:02.900 --> 3:00:05.180\n By binding myself to them.\n\n3:00:07.060 --> 3:00:09.180\n Well, maybe the same thing is true of life, right?\n\n3:00:09.180 --> 3:00:10.580\n You bind yourself to it.\n\n3:00:10.580 --> 3:00:12.540\n And the tighter you bind yourself to it,\n\n3:00:12.540 --> 3:00:14.740\n the more you find out what it is.\n\n3:00:14.740 --> 3:00:17.180\n And that's like a radical embrace.\n\n3:00:17.180 --> 3:00:19.180\n And it's a really radical embrace.\n\n3:00:19.180 --> 3:00:20.460\n That's the crucifix symbol.\n\n3:00:20.460 --> 3:00:22.820\n And more than that, because like I said,\n\n3:00:22.820 --> 3:00:26.300\n the full passion story isn't death.\n\n3:00:26.300 --> 3:00:28.460\n It isn't even unjust death.\n\n3:00:28.460 --> 3:00:30.620\n It isn't even unjust death\n\n3:00:30.620 --> 3:00:33.340\n and the crucifixion of the innocent,\n\n3:00:33.340 --> 3:00:35.580\n which is really getting pretty bad.\n\n3:00:35.580 --> 3:00:40.580\n It's unjust, torturous, innocent death,\n\n3:00:42.220 --> 3:00:46.500\n attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.\n\n3:00:47.460 --> 3:00:50.660\n Well, that's a hell of a thing to radically embrace.\n\n3:00:50.660 --> 3:00:51.740\n It's like, bring it on.\n\n3:00:53.380 --> 3:00:57.980\n I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal\n\n3:00:57.980 --> 3:01:02.980\n and think they can get to that ideal\n\n3:01:02.980 --> 3:01:05.900\n while living in a place of cynicism\n\n3:01:05.900 --> 3:01:07.700\n and ultimately escape from life\n\n3:01:07.700 --> 3:01:10.020\n and hiding from life, afraid of life.\n\n3:01:10.020 --> 3:01:13.940\n And it's beautifully put that love\n\n3:01:13.940 --> 3:01:18.100\n is the highest ideal to reach for and truth is.\n\n3:01:18.100 --> 3:01:19.420\n It's handmade.\n\n3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:21.060\n I thought about that for a long time, right?\n\n3:01:21.060 --> 3:01:22.980\n This hierarchy of ideal.\n\n3:01:22.980 --> 3:01:25.100\n And the thing about truth, that bitter truth,\n\n3:01:25.100 --> 3:01:26.540\n let's say, that cynical truth,\n\n3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:31.140\n is it can break the shackles of naivety.\n\n3:01:31.140 --> 3:01:34.420\n And actually a burnt cynicism\n\n3:01:34.420 --> 3:01:38.900\n is a moral improvement over a blind naivety.\n\n3:01:39.900 --> 3:01:42.540\n Even though one is in some ways positive,\n\n3:01:42.540 --> 3:01:44.180\n but only because it's protected.\n\n3:01:44.180 --> 3:01:48.060\n And the other is bitter and dark, but still better.\n\n3:01:48.060 --> 3:01:49.500\n But you're not done at that point.\n\n3:01:49.500 --> 3:01:51.340\n You're just barely started.\n\n3:01:51.340 --> 3:01:53.100\n It's like, you're cynical?\n\n3:01:53.100 --> 3:01:54.460\n You're not cynical enough.\n\n3:01:55.500 --> 3:01:57.060\n It's like, how cynical are you?\n\n3:01:57.060 --> 3:02:01.420\n Are you, I'm an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?\n\n3:02:01.420 --> 3:02:03.460\n Because you have to be,\n\n3:02:03.460 --> 3:02:05.580\n you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds\n\n3:02:05.580 --> 3:02:07.220\n before you find that part of you.\n\n3:02:07.220 --> 3:02:09.420\n But you can find it if you want.\n\n3:02:09.420 --> 3:02:11.820\n And then you think, well, I want to stop this.\n\n3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:14.420\n Well, that was the question you posed.\n\n3:02:14.420 --> 3:02:15.860\n In some sense, you're obsessed with,\n\n3:02:15.860 --> 3:02:19.860\n say, what happened on these mass scale catastrophes\n\n3:02:19.860 --> 3:02:21.380\n in the communist countries.\n\n3:02:21.380 --> 3:02:24.740\n It's like, well, millions of people participated.\n\n3:02:24.740 --> 3:02:28.100\n So you could have, and maybe you would have enjoyed it.\n\n3:02:28.100 --> 3:02:30.140\n So what part of that is you?\n\n3:02:30.140 --> 3:02:32.700\n And you can find it if you want.\n\n3:02:33.980 --> 3:02:35.420\n Yeah, it's all there.\n\n3:02:35.420 --> 3:02:39.100\n The prisoner, the interrogator, the Judas.\n\n3:02:40.140 --> 3:02:41.940\n Pontius Pilate.\n\n3:02:41.940 --> 3:02:42.780\n All of it.\n\n3:02:42.780 --> 3:02:43.620\n All of it, yeah.\n\n3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:45.420\n And all of it is inside us.\n\n3:02:45.420 --> 3:02:46.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:46.260 --> 3:02:48.100\n And you just have to look.\n\n3:02:48.100 --> 3:02:51.940\n And once you do, maybe eventually you can find the love.\n\n3:02:51.940 --> 3:02:53.860\n Jordan, you're an incredible human being.\n\n3:02:53.860 --> 3:02:56.460\n I'm deeply honored you would talk to me.\n\n3:02:56.460 --> 3:02:59.220\n Thank you for being a truth seeker in this world.\n\n3:02:59.220 --> 3:03:01.020\n And thank you for the love.\n\n3:03:01.020 --> 3:03:03.540\n Hey, thanks for the invitation, man.\n\n3:03:04.500 -->

Nietzsche.\n\n3:03:15.540 --> 3:03:17.620\n You must have chaos within you\n\n3:03:17.620 --> 3:03:19.900\n to give birth to a dancing star.\n\n3:03:20.980 --> 3:03:23.220\n Thank you for listening
