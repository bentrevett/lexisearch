  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.280\n The following is a conversation with Vladimir Vapnik, part two, the second\n\n00:05.280 --> 00:06.640\n time we spoke on the podcast.\n\n00:07.280 --> 00:11.440\n He's the coinventor of support vector machines, support vector clustering, VC\n\n00:11.440 --> 00:14.480\n theory, and many foundational ideas and statistical learning.\n\n00:14.960 --> 00:19.320\n He was born in the Soviet Union, worked at the Institute of Control Sciences\n\n00:19.320 --> 00:26.000\n in Moscow, then in the US, worked at AT&T, NEC labs, Facebook AI research,\n\n00:26.080 --> 00:28.640\n and now is a professor at Columbia University.\n\n00:28.640 --> 00:31.840\n His work has been cited over 200,000 times.\n\n00:32.320 --> 00:35.040\n The first time we spoke on the podcast was just over a year\n\n00:35.040 --> 00:37.520\n ago, one of the early episodes.\n\n00:38.240 --> 00:42.760\n This time we spoke after a lecture he gave titled complete statistical theory\n\n00:42.760 --> 00:46.560\n of learning as part of the MIT series of lectures on deep learning\n\n00:46.720 --> 00:48.560\n and AI that I organized.\n\n00:49.520 --> 00:52.240\n I'll release the video of the lecture in the next few days.\n\n00:53.040 --> 00:56.840\n This podcast and lecture are independent from each other, so you don't need\n\n00:56.840 --> 00:58.640\n one to understand the other.\n\n00:59.000 --> 01:04.040\n The lecture is quite technical and math heavy, so if you do watch both, I\n\n01:04.040 --> 01:07.320\n recommend listening to this podcast first, since the podcast is\n\n01:07.320 --> 01:09.600\n probably a bit more accessible.\n\n01:10.800 --> 01:13.280\n This is the artificial intelligence podcast.\n\n01:13.560 --> 01:17.360\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple podcasts,\n\n01:17.520 --> 01:20.400\n support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:20.720 --> 01:23.680\n at Lex Friedman spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:23.680 --> 01:27.800\n As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now and never any ads in\n\n01:27.800 --> 01:30.040\n the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:30.440 --> 01:33.680\n I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:35.080 --> 01:38.960\n This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the app store.\n\n01:39.480 --> 01:42.040\n When you get it, use code LexPodcast.\n\n01:42.760 --> 01:46.440\n Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:48.200\n stock market with as little as $1.\n\n01:48.680 --> 01:52.720\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square\n\n01:52.720 --> 01:57.520\n and member SIPC, since Cash App allows you to send and receive money\n\n01:57.520 --> 02:02.080\n digitally, peer to peer, and security in all digital transactions is very important.\n\n02:02.400 --> 02:07.440\n Let me mention that PCI data security standard, PCI DSS level one,\n\n02:07.760 --> 02:09.880\n that Cash App is compliant with.\n\n02:10.920 --> 02:16.480\n I'm a big fan of standards for safety and security and PCI DSS is a good\n\n02:16.480 --> 02:20.480\n example of that, where a bunch of competitors got together and agreed\n\n02:20.480 --> 02:23.840\n that there needs to be a global standard around the security of transactions.\n\n02:24.480 --> 02:27.440\n Now we just need to do the same for autonomous vehicles\n\n02:27.480 --> 02:28.960\n and AI systems in general.\n\n02:30.000 --> 02:34.200\n So again, if you get Cash App from the app store or Google Play and use the code\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:40.240\n LexPodcast, you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, one of my\n\n02:40.240 --> 02:45.040\n favorite organizations that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education\n\n02:45.040 --> 02:46.800\n for young people around the world.\n\n02:46.800 --> 02:51.040\n And now here's my conversation with Vladimir Vapnik.\n\n02:52.440 --> 02:58.040\n You and I talked about Alan Turing yesterday a little bit and that he, as the\n\n02:58.040 --> 03:02.080\n father of artificial intelligence, may have instilled in our field, an ethic\n\n03:02.080 --> 03:06.560\n of engineering and not science, seeking more to build intelligence\n\n03:06.560 --> 03:08.120\n rather than to understand it.\n\n03:09.160 --> 03:13.760\n What do you think is the difference between these two paths of engineering\n\n03:13.760 --> 03:17.120\n intelligence and the science of intelligence?\n\n03:18.120 --> 03:19.520\n It's a completely different story.\n\n03:20.520 --> 03:24.320\n Engineering is a mutation of human activity.\n\n03:25.320 --> 03:34.640\n You have to make a device which behaves as humans behave, have all the functions\n\n03:34.640 --> 03:35.320\n of humans.\n\n03:36.120 --> 03:41.360\n It doesn't matter how you do it, but to understand what is intelligence,\n\n03:41.360 --> 03:47.480\n but to understand what is intelligence about, it's quite a different problem.\n\n03:48.920 --> 03:55.160\n So I think, I believe that it's somehow related to the predicate we talked\n\n03:55.160 --> 04:04.760\n yesterday about, because look at the Vladimir Propp's idea.\n\n04:04.760 --> 04:17.600\n He just found 31 here, predicates, he called it units, which can explain\n\n04:17.600 --> 04:20.760\n human behavior, at least in Russian tales.\n\n04:20.760 --> 04:24.400\n You look at Russian tales and derive from that.\n\n04:24.840 --> 04:29.120\n And then people realize that it's more wide than in Russian tales.\n\n04:29.480 --> 04:33.720\n It is in TV, in movie serials and so on and so on.\n\n04:33.720 --> 04:39.960\n So you're talking about Vladimir Propp, who in 1928 published a book,\n\n04:39.960 --> 04:46.400\n Morphology of the Folktale, describing 31 predicates that have this kind of\n\n04:46.400 --> 04:53.320\n sequential structure that a lot of the stories, narratives follow in Russian\n\n04:53.320 --> 04:54.720\n folklore and in other contexts.\n\n04:54.960 --> 04:55.880\n We'll talk about it.\n\n04:56.040 --> 05:00.400\n I'd like to talk about predicates in a focused way, but let me, if you allow\n\n05:00.400 --> 05:06.600\n me to stay zoomed out on our friend, Alan Turing, and, you know, he inspired\n\n05:06.600 --> 05:09.440\n a generation with the imitation game.\n\n05:10.080 --> 05:10.600\n Yes.\n\n05:11.560 --> 05:16.320\n Do you think if we can linger on that a little bit longer, do you think we can\n\n05:17.480 --> 05:22.960\n learn, do you think learning to imitate intelligence can get us closer to the\n\n05:22.960 --> 05:24.920\n science, to understanding intelligence?\n\n05:24.920 --> 05:31.440\n So why do you think imitation is so far from understanding?\n\n05:32.200 --> 05:35.880\n I think that it is different between you have different goals.\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:42.800\n So your goal is to create something, something useful.\n\n05:43.080 --> 05:43.360\n Yeah.\n\n05:43.560 --> 05:44.600\n And that is great.\n\n05:45.400 --> 05:51.240\n And you can see how much things was done and I believe that it will be done even\n\n05:51.240 --> 05:57.240\n more, it's self driving cars and also the business, it is great.\n\n05:57.920 --> 06:01.440\n And it was inspired by Turing's vision.\n\n06:02.640 --> 06:04.600\n But understanding is very difficult.\n\n06:05.000 --> 06:07.200\n It's more or less philosophical category.\n\n06:07.840 --> 06:09.880\n What means understand the world?\n\n06:10.800 --> 06:18.040\n I believe in scheme which starts from Plato, that there exists world of ideas.\n\n06:18.040 --> 06:24.280\n I believe that intelligence, it is world of ideas, but it is world of pure ideas.\n\n06:24.840 --> 06:34.400\n And when you combine them with reality things, it creates, as in my case,\n\n06:34.400 --> 06:36.960\n invariants, which is very specific.\n\n06:37.520 --> 06:47.320\n And that's, I believe, the combination of ideas in way to constructing invariants.\n\n06:47.320 --> 06:49.520\n Constructing invariant is intelligence.\n\n06:49.760 --> 06:56.080\n But first of all, predicate, if you know, predicate and hopefully\n\n06:56.080 --> 07:00.160\n then not too much predicate exists.\n\n07:00.760 --> 07:05.880\n For example, 31 predicate for human behavior, it is not a lot.\n\n07:06.040 --> 07:12.720\n Vladimir Propp used 31, you can even call them predicate, 31\n\n07:12.720 --> 07:17.200\n predicates to describe stories, narratives.\n\n07:17.640 --> 07:22.560\n Do you think human behavior, how much of human behavior, how much of our\n\n07:22.560 --> 07:28.000\n world, our universe, all the things that matter in our existence can be\n\n07:28.000 --> 07:32.040\n summarized in predicates of the kind that Propp was working with?\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:38.760\n I think that we have a lot of form of behavior, but I think that\n\n07:38.760 --> 07:43.800\n predicate is much less because even in this example, which I gave you\n\n07:43.840 --> 07:54.880\n yesterday, you saw that predicate can be, one predicate can construct many\n\n07:55.000 --> 07:58.840\n different invariants depending on your data.\n\n07:59.360 --> 08:03.560\n They're applying to different data and they give different invariants.\n\n08:04.200 --> 08:08.600\n So, but pure ideas, maybe not so much.\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:09.360\n Not so many.\n\n08:09.880 --> 08:14.640\n I don't know about that, but my guess, I hope that's why challenge\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:18.560\n about digit recognition, how much you need.\n\n08:19.600 --> 08:23.560\n I think we'll talk about computer vision and 2D images a little bit\n\n08:23.560 --> 08:24.560\n in your challenge.\n\n08:24.800 --> 08:26.640\n That's exactly about intelligence.\n\n08:26.720 --> 08:33.880\n That's exactly, that's exactly about, no, that hopes to be exactly about\n\n08:33.880 --> 08:37.160\n the spirit of intelligence in the simplest possible way.\n\n08:37.160 --> 08:40.760\n Yeah, absolutely you should start the simplest way, otherwise you\n\n08:40.760 --> 08:41.960\n will not be able to do it.\n\n08:42.320 --> 08:46.680\n Well, there's an open question whether starting at the MNIST digit\n\n08:46.680 --> 08:51.520\n recognition is a step towards intelligence or it's an entirely different thing.\n\n08:52.320 --> 08:58.880\n I think that to beat records using say 100, 200 times less examples,\n\n08:59.360 --> 09:00.320\n you need intelligence.\n\n09:00.360 --> 09:01.200\n You need intelligence.\n\n09:01.200 --> 09:05.800\n So let's, because you use this term and it would be nice, I'd like to\n\n09:05.800 --> 09:08.680\n ask simple, maybe even dumb questions.\n\n09:09.640 --> 09:11.000\n Let's start with a predicate.\n\n09:12.520 --> 09:15.640\n In terms of terms and how you think about it, what is a predicate?\n\n09:17.160 --> 09:17.840\n I don't know.\n\n09:18.520 --> 09:26.440\n I have a feeling formally they exist, but I believe that predicate for\n\n09:26.440 --> 09:31.280\n 2D images, one of them is symmetry.\n\n09:31.960 --> 09:32.560\n Hold on a second.\n\n09:32.560 --> 09:32.960\n Sorry.\n\n09:32.960 --> 09:35.600\n Sorry, sorry to interrupt and pull you back.\n\n09:36.440 --> 09:40.360\n At the simplest level, we're not even, we're not being profound currently.\n\n09:40.680 --> 09:43.840\n A predicate is a statement of something that is true.\n\n09:44.880 --> 09:45.280\n Yes.\n\n09:46.600 --> 09:54.320\n Do you think of predicates as somehow probabilistic in nature or is this binary?\n\n09:54.640 --> 09:59.840\n This is truly constraints of logical statements about the world.\n\n09:59.840 --> 10:02.800\n In my definition, the simplest predicate is function.\n\n10:03.800 --> 10:09.920\n Function, and you can use this function to make inner product that is predicate.\n\n10:10.480 --> 10:12.920\n What's the input and what's the output of the function?\n\n10:13.600 --> 10:17.760\n Input is X, something which is input in reality.\n\n10:18.240 --> 10:25.440\n Say if you consider digit recognition, it pixel space input, but it is\n\n10:25.440 --> 10:36.240\n function which in pixel space, but it can be any function from pixel space and you\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:43.160\n choose, and I believe that there are several functions which is important for\n\n10:43.160 --> 10:45.680\n understanding of images.\n\n10:46.400 --> 10:48.200\n One of them is symmetry.\n\n10:48.240 --> 10:53.720\n It's not so simple construction as I described with the derivative, with all\n\n10:53.720 --> 10:59.600\n this stuff, but another, I believe, I don't know how many, is how well\n\n10:59.600 --> 11:02.320\n structurized is picture.\n\n11:03.240 --> 11:04.200\n Structurized?\n\n11:04.280 --> 11:04.600\n Yeah.\n\n11:04.840 --> 11:06.320\n What do you mean by structurized?\n\n11:06.960 --> 11:08.640\n It is formal definition.\n\n11:09.040 --> 11:16.600\n Say something heavy on the left corner, not so heavy in the middle and so on.\n\n11:17.040 --> 11:21.840\n You describe in general concept of what you assume.\n\n11:21.840 --> 11:25.120\n Concepts, some kind of universal concepts.\n\n11:25.200 --> 11:29.000\n Yeah, but I don't know how to formalize this.\n\n11:29.160 --> 11:29.760\n Do you?\n\n11:29.840 --> 11:30.880\n So this is the thing.\n\n11:31.560 --> 11:33.600\n There's a million ways we can talk about this.\n\n11:33.600 --> 11:40.000\n I'll keep bringing it up, but we humans have such concepts when we look at\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:44.000\n digits, but it's hard to put them, just like you're saying now, it's\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.480\n hard to put them into words.\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:54.600\n You know, that is example, when critics in music, trying to describe music,\n\n11:55.440 --> 12:02.040\n they use predicate and not too many predicate, but in different combination,\n\n12:02.600 --> 12:10.440\n but they have some special words for describing music and the same\n\n12:10.440 --> 12:16.920\n should be for images, but maybe there are critics who understand essence\n\n12:16.920 --> 12:19.200\n of what this image is about.\n\n12:20.960 --> 12:26.960\n Do you think there exists critics who can summarize the essence of\n\n12:26.960 --> 12:28.160\n images, human beings?\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:32.440\n I hope so, yes, but that...\n\n12:32.440 --> 12:34.520\n Explicitly state them on paper.\n\n12:34.520 --> 12:41.840\n The fundamental question I'm asking is, do you think there exists a small\n\n12:41.840 --> 12:44.560\n set of predicates that will summarize images?\n\n12:45.040 --> 12:50.840\n It feels to our mind, like it does, that the concept of what makes a two\n\n12:50.840 --> 12:52.520\n and a three and a four...\n\n12:53.000 --> 12:55.760\n No, no, no, it's not on this level.\n\n12:58.040 --> 13:01.240\n It should not describe two, three, four.\n\n13:01.240 --> 13:06.840\n It describes some construction, which allow you to create invariance.\n\n13:08.040 --> 13:11.760\n And invariance, sorry to stick on this, but terminology.\n\n13:12.360 --> 13:18.920\n Invariance, it is property of your image.\n\n13:21.040 --> 13:27.760\n Say, I can say, looking on my image, it is more or less symmetric.\n\n13:27.760 --> 13:33.360\n Looking on my image, it is more or less symmetric, and I can give you value\n\n13:33.360 --> 13:40.560\n of symmetry, say, level of symmetry, using this function which I gave\n\n13:40.560 --> 13:51.560\n yesterday. And you can describe that your image has these characteristics\n\n13:51.560 --> 13:56.640\n exactly in the way how musical critics describe music.\n\n13:56.640 --> 14:05.400\n So, but this is invariant applied to specific data, to specific music,\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:06.040\n to something.\n\n14:07.640 --> 14:14.960\n I strongly believe in this plot ideas that there exists world of predicate\n\n14:14.960 --> 14:20.160\n and world of reality, and predicate and reality is somehow connected,\n\n14:20.160 --> 14:22.080\n and you have to know that.\n\n14:22.400 --> 14:23.960\n Let's talk about Plato a little bit.\n\n14:23.960 --> 14:29.000\n So you draw a line from Plato, to Hegel, to Wigner, to today.\n\n14:30.120 --> 14:35.440\n So Plato has forms, the theory of forms.\n\n14:35.440 --> 14:39.400\n So there's a world of ideas and a world of things, as you talk about,\n\n14:39.400 --> 14:40.400\n and there's a connection.\n\n14:40.400 --> 14:45.720\n And presumably the world of ideas is very small, and the world of things\n\n14:45.720 --> 14:52.520\n is arbitrarily big, but they're all what Plato calls them like, it's a shadow.\n\n14:52.520 --> 14:55.040\n The real world is a shadow from the world of forms.\n\n14:55.040 --> 14:58.840\n Yeah, you have projection of a world of ideas.\n\n14:58.840 --> 15:00.640\n Yeah, very poetic.\n\n15:00.640 --> 15:07.040\n In reality, you can realize this projection using these invariants\n\n15:07.040 --> 15:13.600\n because it is projection for own specific examples, which create specific features\n\n15:13.600 --> 15:14.840\n of specific objects.\n\n15:14.840 --> 15:22.920\n So the essence of intelligence is while only being able to observe\n\n15:22.920 --> 15:26.720\n the world of things, try to come up with a world of ideas.\n\n15:26.720 --> 15:27.720\n Exactly.\n\n15:27.720 --> 15:33.040\n Like in this music story, intelligent musical critics knows all these words\n\n15:33.040 --> 15:34.840\n and have a feeling about what they mean.\n\n15:34.840 --> 15:38.800\n I feel like that's a contradiction, intelligent music critics.\n\n15:38.800 --> 15:47.280\n But I think music is to be enjoyed in all its forms.\n\n15:47.280 --> 15:49.840\n The notion of critic, like a food critic.\n\n15:49.840 --> 15:51.800\n No, I don't want touch emotion.\n\n15:51.800 --> 15:53.440\n That's an interesting question.\n\n15:53.440 --> 15:54.640\n Does emotion...\n\n15:54.640 --> 15:59.240\n There's certain elements of the human psychology, of the human experience,\n\n15:59.240 --> 16:04.720\n which seem to almost contradict intelligence and reason.\n\n16:04.720 --> 16:11.160\n Like emotion, like fear, like love, all of those things,\n\n16:11.160 --> 16:16.520\n are those not connected in any way to the space of ideas?\n\n16:16.520 --> 16:18.560\n That I don't know.\n\n16:18.560 --> 16:27.720\n I just want to be concentrate on very simple story, on digit recognition.\n\n16:27.720 --> 16:31.800\n So you don't think you have to love and fear death in order to recognize digits?\n\n16:31.800 --> 16:33.600\n I don't know.\n\n16:33.600 --> 16:36.560\n Because it's so complicated.\n\n16:36.560 --> 16:41.200\n It involves a lot of stuff which I never considered.\n\n16:41.200 --> 16:44.720\n But I know about digit recognition.\n\n16:44.720 --> 16:50.360\n And I know that for digit recognition,\n\n16:50.360 --> 16:59.040\n to get records from small number of observations, you need predicate.\n\n16:59.040 --> 17:03.240\n But not special predicate for this problem.\n\n17:03.240 --> 17:08.480\n But universal predicate, which understand world of images.\n\n17:08.480 --> 17:09.920\n Of visual information.\n\n17:09.920 --> 17:11.120\n Visual, yes.\n\n17:11.120 --> 17:18.440\n But on the first step, they understand, say, world of handwritten digits,\n\n17:18.440 --> 17:21.400\n or characters, or something simple.\n\n17:21.400 --> 17:23.800\n So like you said, symmetry is an interesting one.\n\n17:23.800 --> 17:28.720\n No, that's what I think one of the predicate is related to symmetry.\n\n17:28.720 --> 17:30.720\n The level of symmetry.\n\n17:30.720 --> 17:32.120\n Okay, degree of symmetry.\n\n17:32.120 --> 17:37.200\n So you think symmetry at the bottom is a universal notion,\n\n17:37.200 --> 17:41.480\n and there's degrees of a single kind of symmetry,\n\n17:41.480 --> 17:44.160\n or is there many kinds of symmetries?\n\n17:44.160 --> 17:46.000\n Many kinds of symmetries.\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:52.360\n There is a symmetry, antisymmetry, say, letter S.\n\n17:52.360 --> 17:58.400\n So it has vertical antisymmetry.\n\n17:58.400 --> 18:02.640\n And it could be diagonal symmetry, vertical symmetry.\n\n18:02.640 --> 18:07.760\n So when you cut vertically the letter S...\n\n18:07.760 --> 18:16.600\n Yeah, then the upper part and lower part in different directions.\n\n18:16.600 --> 18:18.920\n Inverted, along the Y axis.\n\n18:18.920 --> 18:21.240\n But that's just like one example of symmetry, right?\n\n18:21.240 --> 18:21.960\n Isn't there like...\n\n18:21.960 --> 18:26.320\n Right, but there is a degree of symmetry.\n\n18:26.320 --> 18:35.040\n If you play all this iterative stuff to do tangent distance,\n\n18:35.040 --> 18:40.480\n whatever I describe, you can have a degree of symmetry.\n\n18:40.480 --> 18:45.920\n And that is what describing reason of image.\n\n18:45.920 --> 18:53.200\n It is the same as you will describe this image.\n\n18:53.200 --> 18:57.920\n Think about digit S, it has antisymmetry.\n\n18:57.920 --> 19:00.880\n Digit three is symmetric.\n\n19:00.880 --> 19:04.480\n More or less, look for symmetry.\n\n19:04.480 --> 19:07.840\n Do you think such concepts like symmetry,\n\n19:07.840 --> 19:14.360\n predicates like symmetry, is it a hierarchical set of concepts?\n\n19:14.360 --> 19:20.080\n Or are these independent, distinct predicates\n\n19:20.080 --> 19:23.600\n that we want to discover as some set of...\n\n19:23.600 --> 19:25.960\n No, there is an idea of symmetry.\n\n19:25.960 --> 19:34.880\n And you can, this idea of symmetry, make very general.\n\n19:34.880 --> 19:37.120\n Like degree of symmetry.\n\n19:37.120 --> 19:40.680\n If degree of symmetry can be zero, no symmetry at all.\n\n19:40.680 --> 19:46.960\n Or degree of symmetry, say, more or less symmetrical.\n\n19:46.960 --> 19:50.480\n But you have one of these descriptions.\n\n19:50.480 --> 19:52.480\n And symmetry can be different.\n\n19:52.480 --> 19:56.320\n As I told, horizontal, vertical, diagonal,\n\n19:56.320 --> 20:01.400\n and antisymmetry is also concept of symmetry.\n\n20:01.400 --> 20:03.320\n What about shape in general?\n\n20:03.320 --> 20:06.920\n I mean, symmetry is a fascinating notion, but...\n\n20:06.920 --> 20:08.600\n No, no, I'm talking about digit.\n\n20:08.600 --> 20:12.440\n I would like to concentrate on all I would like to know,\n\n20:12.440 --> 20:14.440\n predicate for digit recognition.\n\n20:14.440 --> 20:19.360\n Yes, but symmetry is not enough for digit recognition, right?\n\n20:19.360 --> 20:22.520\n It is not necessarily for digit recognition.\n\n20:22.520 --> 20:30.640\n It helps to create invariant, which you can use\n\n20:30.640 --> 20:35.000\n when you will have examples for digit recognition.\n\n20:35.000 --> 20:38.240\n You have regular problem of digit recognition.\n\n20:38.240 --> 20:41.600\n You have examples of the first class or second class.\n\n20:41.600 --> 20:45.840\n Plus, you know that there exists concept of symmetry.\n\n20:45.840 --> 20:50.400\n And you apply, when you're looking for decision rule,\n\n20:50.400 --> 20:55.400\n you will apply concept of symmetry,\n\n20:55.400 --> 21:00.120\n of this level of symmetry, which you estimate from...\n\n21:00.120 --> 21:01.680\n So let's talk.\n\n21:01.680 --> 21:06.600\n Everything comes from weak convergence.\n\n21:06.600 --> 21:07.840\n What is convergence?\n\n21:07.840 --> 21:09.280\n What is weak convergence?\n\n21:09.280 --> 21:11.360\n What is strong convergence?\n\n21:11.360 --> 21:13.360\n I'm sorry, I'm gonna do this to you.\n\n21:13.360 --> 21:16.120\n What are we converging from and to?\n\n21:16.120 --> 21:20.480\n You're converging, you would like to have a function.\n\n21:20.480 --> 21:23.600\n The function which, say, indicator function,\n\n21:23.600 --> 21:29.920\n which indicate your digit five, for example.\n\n21:29.920 --> 21:31.480\n A classification task.\n\n21:31.480 --> 21:33.640\n Let's talk only about classification.\n\n21:33.640 --> 21:36.840\n So classification means you will say\n\n21:36.840 --> 21:38.560\n whether this is a five or not,\n\n21:38.560 --> 21:40.600\n or say which of the 10 digits it is.\n\n21:40.600 --> 21:42.160\n Right, right.\n\n21:42.160 --> 21:46.560\n I would like to have these functions.\n\n21:46.560 --> 21:56.040\n Then, I have some examples.\n\n21:56.040 --> 22:01.120\n I can consider property of these examples.\n\n22:01.120 --> 22:02.720\n Say, symmetry.\n\n22:02.720 --> 22:08.040\n And I can measure level of symmetry for every digit.\n\n22:08.040 --> 22:16.680\n And then I can take average from my training data.\n\n22:16.680 --> 22:20.920\n And I will consider only functions\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:24.000\n of conditional probability,\n\n22:24.000 --> 22:27.280\n which I'm looking for my decision rule.\n\n22:27.280 --> 22:38.360\n Which applying to digits will give me the same average\n\n22:38.360 --> 22:41.960\n as I observe on training data.\n\n22:41.960 --> 22:45.360\n So, actually, this is different level\n\n22:45.360 --> 22:48.480\n of description of what you want.\n\n22:48.480 --> 22:54.080\n You want not just, you show not one digit.\n\n22:54.080 --> 22:59.840\n You show, this predicate, show general property\n\n22:59.840 --> 23:03.720\n of all digits which you have in mind.\n\n23:03.720 --> 23:06.080\n If you have in mind digit three,\n\n23:06.080 --> 23:10.360\n it gives you property of digit three.\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:13.560\n And you select as admissible set of function,\n\n23:13.560 --> 23:16.960\n only function, which keeps this property.\n\n23:16.960 --> 23:20.760\n You will not consider other functions.\n\n23:20.760 --> 23:24.920\n So, you immediately looking for smaller subset of function.\n\n23:24.920 --> 23:27.000\n That's what you mean by admissible functions.\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:28.400\n Admissible function, exactly.\n\n23:28.400 --> 23:30.920\n Which is still a pretty large,\n\n23:30.920 --> 23:32.920\n for the number three, is a large.\n\n23:32.920 --> 23:36.600\n It is pretty large, but if you have one predicate.\n\n23:36.600 --> 23:42.760\n But according to, there is a strong and weak convergence.\n\n23:42.760 --> 23:46.360\n Strong convergence is convergence in function.\n\n23:46.360 --> 23:49.200\n You're looking for the function on one function,\n\n23:49.200 --> 23:51.880\n and you're looking for another function.\n\n23:51.880 --> 23:59.240\n And square difference from them should be small.\n\n23:59.240 --> 24:01.880\n If you take difference in any points,\n\n24:01.880 --> 24:05.640\n make a square, make an integral, and it should be small.\n\n24:05.640 --> 24:08.040\n That is convergence in function.\n\n24:08.040 --> 24:11.280\n Suppose you have some function, any function.\n\n24:11.280 --> 24:15.400\n So, I would say, I say that some function\n\n24:15.400 --> 24:17.880\n converge to this function.\n\n24:17.880 --> 24:22.880\n If integral from square difference between them is small.\n\n24:22.880 --> 24:24.760\n That's the definition of strong convergence.\n\n24:24.760 --> 24:25.760\n That definition of strong convergence.\n\n24:25.760 --> 24:28.920\n Two functions, the integral, the difference, is small.\n\n24:28.920 --> 24:31.160\n Yeah, it is convergence in functions.\n\n24:31.160 --> 24:32.280\n Yeah.\n\n24:32.280 --> 24:36.720\n But you have different convergence in functionals.\n\n24:36.720 --> 24:41.160\n You take any function, you take some function, phi,\n\n24:41.160 --> 24:46.040\n and take inner product, this function, this f function.\n\n24:46.040 --> 24:50.360\n f0 function, which you want to find.\n\n24:50.360 --> 24:52.960\n And that gives you some value.\n\n24:52.960 --> 24:59.960\n So, you say that set of functions converge\n\n24:59.960 --> 25:03.040\n in inner product to this function,\n\n25:03.040 --> 25:10.400\n if this value of inner product converge to value f0.\n\n25:10.400 --> 25:12.480\n That is for one phi.\n\n25:12.480 --> 25:16.320\n But weak convergence requires that it converge for any\n\n25:16.320 --> 25:20.680\n function of Hilbert space.\n\n25:20.680 --> 25:24.200\n If it converge for any function of Hilbert space,\n\n25:24.200 --> 25:28.240\n then you will say that this is weak convergence.\n\n25:28.240 --> 25:32.200\n You can think that when you take integral,\n\n25:32.200 --> 25:35.920\n that is integral property of function.\n\n25:35.920 --> 25:39.120\n For example, if you will take sine or cosine,\n\n25:39.120 --> 25:45.480\n it is coefficient of, say, Fourier expansion.\n\n25:45.480 --> 25:51.440\n So, if it converge for all coefficients of Fourier\n\n25:51.440 --> 25:54.240\n expansion, so under some condition,\n\n25:54.240 --> 25:58.080\n it converge to function you're looking for.\n\n25:58.080 --> 26:02.800\n But weak convergence means any property.\n\n26:02.800 --> 26:07.640\n Convergence not point wise, but integral property\n\n26:07.640 --> 26:09.480\n of function.\n\n26:09.480 --> 26:13.800\n So, weak convergence means integral property of functions.\n\n26:13.800 --> 26:16.040\n When I'm talking about predicate,\n\n26:16.040 --> 26:23.200\n I would like to formulate which integral properties\n\n26:23.200 --> 26:27.840\n I would like to have for convergence.\n\n26:27.840 --> 26:33.440\n So, and if I will take one predicated function,\n\n26:33.440 --> 26:39.600\n which I measure property, if I will use one predicate\n\n26:39.600 --> 26:44.840\n and say, I will consider only function which give me\n\n26:44.840 --> 26:47.840\n the same value as this predicate,\n\n26:47.840 --> 26:53.440\n I selecting set of functions from functions\n\n26:53.440 --> 26:58.000\n which is admissible in the sense that function which I'm\n\n26:58.000 --> 27:01.000\n looking for in this set of functions\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:08.760\n because I checking in training data, it gives the same.\n\n27:08.760 --> 27:10.960\n Yeah, so it always has to be connected to the training\n\n27:10.960 --> 27:12.600\n data in terms of?\n\n27:12.600 --> 27:18.720\n Yeah, but property, you can know independent on training data.\n\n27:18.720 --> 27:24.000\n And this guy, prop, says that there is formal property,\n\n27:24.000 --> 27:25.360\n 31 property.\n\n27:25.360 --> 27:27.640\n A fairy tale, a Russian fairy tale.\n\n27:27.640 --> 27:30.560\n But Russian fairy tale is not so interesting.\n\n27:30.560 --> 27:34.880\n More interesting that people apply this to movies,\n\n27:34.880 --> 27:38.000\n to theater, to different things.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:41.960\n And the same works, they're universal.\n\n27:41.960 --> 27:44.400\n Well, so I would argue that there's\n\n27:44.400 --> 27:48.520\n a little bit of a difference between the kinds of things\n\n27:48.520 --> 27:51.480\n that were applied to which are essentially stories\n\n27:51.480 --> 27:54.240\n and digit recognition.\n\n27:54.240 --> 27:55.880\n It is the same story.\n\n27:55.880 --> 27:59.600\n You're saying digits, there's a story within the digit.\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:00.360\n Yeah.\n\n28:00.360 --> 28:04.640\n And so but my point is why I hope\n\n28:04.640 --> 28:11.440\n that it possible to beat record using not 60,000,\n\n28:11.440 --> 28:13.800\n but say 100 times less.\n\n28:13.800 --> 28:17.840\n Because instead, you will give predicates.\n\n28:17.840 --> 28:21.040\n And you will select your decision\n\n28:21.040 --> 28:25.680\n not from wide set of functions, but from set of functions\n\n28:25.680 --> 28:28.040\n which keeps this predicates.\n\n28:28.040 --> 28:32.760\n But predicate is not related just to digit recognition.\n\n28:32.760 --> 28:33.800\n Right.\n\n28:33.800 --> 28:37.640\n Like in Plato's case.\n\n28:37.640 --> 28:40.800\n Do you think it's possible to automatically discover\n\n28:40.800 --> 28:42.120\n the predicates?\n\n28:42.120 --> 28:46.520\n So you basically said that the essence of intelligence\n\n28:46.520 --> 28:49.560\n is the discovery of good predicates.\n\n28:49.560 --> 28:51.240\n Yeah.\n\n28:51.240 --> 28:55.800\n Now, the natural question is that's\n\n28:55.800 --> 28:59.040\n what Einstein was good at doing in physics.\n\n28:59.040 --> 29:02.400\n Can we make machines do these kinds\n\n29:02.400 --> 29:04.480\n of discovery of good predicates?\n\n29:04.480 --> 29:07.720\n Or is this ultimately a human endeavor?\n\n29:07.720 --> 29:09.080\n That I don't know.\n\n29:09.080 --> 29:11.400\n I don't think that machine can do.\n\n29:11.400 --> 29:18.840\n Because according to theory about weak convergence,\n\n29:18.840 --> 29:23.120\n any function from Hilbert space can be predicated.\n\n29:23.120 --> 29:27.560\n So you have infinite number of predicate in upper.\n\n29:27.560 --> 29:32.800\n And before, you don't know which predicate is good and which.\n\n29:32.800 --> 29:39.880\n But whatever prop show and why people call it breakthrough,\n\n29:39.880 --> 29:44.600\n that there is not too many predicate\n\n29:44.600 --> 29:48.600\n which cover most of situation happened in the world.\n\n29:48.600 --> 29:51.280\n Right.\n\n29:51.280 --> 29:54.200\n So there's a sea of predicates.\n\n29:54.200 --> 29:57.240\n And most of the only a small amount\n\n29:57.240 --> 29:58.800\n are useful for the kinds of things\n\n29:58.800 --> 30:01.240\n that happen in the world.\n\n30:01.240 --> 30:07.120\n I think that I would say only small part of predicate\n\n30:07.120 --> 30:08.680\n very useful.\n\n30:08.680 --> 30:11.280\n Useful all of them.\n\n30:11.280 --> 30:14.360\n Only very few are what we should let's call them\n\n30:14.360 --> 30:15.440\n good predicates.\n\n30:15.440 --> 30:16.640\n Very good predicates.\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:18.160\n Very good predicates.\n\n30:18.160 --> 30:20.720\n So can we linger on it?\n\n30:20.720 --> 30:21.680\n What's your intuition?\n\n30:21.680 --> 30:27.520\n Why is it hard for a machine to discover good predicates?\n\n30:27.520 --> 30:30.680\n Even in my talk described how to do predicate.\n\n30:30.680 --> 30:32.640\n How to find new predicate.\n\n30:32.640 --> 30:34.960\n I'm not sure that it is very good.\n\n30:34.960 --> 30:36.600\n What did you propose in your talk?\n\n30:36.600 --> 30:37.160\n No.\n\n30:37.160 --> 30:42.360\n In my talk, I gave example for diabetes.\n\n30:42.360 --> 30:43.720\n Diabetes, yeah.\n\n30:43.720 --> 30:46.160\n When we achieve some percent.\n\n30:46.160 --> 30:50.760\n So then we're looking for area where\n\n30:50.760 --> 30:54.760\n some sort of predicate, which I formulate,\n\n30:54.760 --> 31:03.120\n does not keeps invariant.\n\n31:03.120 --> 31:06.920\n So if it doesn't keep, I retrain my data.\n\n31:06.920 --> 31:11.080\n I select only function which keeps this invariant.\n\n31:11.080 --> 31:14.400\n And when I did it, I improved my performance.\n\n31:14.400 --> 31:16.400\n I can looking for this predicate.\n\n31:16.400 --> 31:19.440\n I know technically how to do that.\n\n31:19.440 --> 31:25.560\n And you can, of course, do it using machine.\n\n31:25.560 --> 31:29.560\n But I'm not sure that we will construct the smartest\n\n31:29.560 --> 31:30.920\n predicate.\n\n31:30.920 --> 31:34.120\n But this is the, allow me to linger on it.\n\n31:34.120 --> 31:35.280\n Because that's the essence.\n\n31:35.280 --> 31:36.240\n That's the challenge.\n\n31:36.240 --> 31:37.600\n That is artificial.\n\n31:37.600 --> 31:40.320\n That's the human level intelligence\n\n31:40.320 --> 31:43.720\n that we seek is the discovery of these good predicates.\n\n31:43.720 --> 31:47.560\n You've talked about deep learning as a way to,\n\n31:47.560 --> 31:52.960\n the predicates they use and the functions are mediocre.\n\n31:52.960 --> 31:55.000\n You can find better ones.\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:57.280\n Let's talk about deep learning.\n\n31:57.280 --> 31:58.360\n Sure, let's do it.\n\n31:58.360 --> 32:04.200\n I know only Jan's Likun convolutional network.\n\n32:04.200 --> 32:05.160\n And what else?\n\n32:05.160 --> 32:05.920\n I don't know.\n\n32:05.920 --> 32:07.960\n And it's a very simple convolution.\n\n32:07.960 --> 32:09.120\n There's not much else to know.\n\n32:09.120 --> 32:10.400\n To pixel left and right.\n\n32:10.400 --> 32:14.600\n I can do it like that with one predicate.\n\n32:14.600 --> 32:16.640\n Convolution is a single predicate.\n\n32:16.640 --> 32:17.600\n It's single.\n\n32:17.600 --> 32:21.120\n It's single predicate.\n\n32:21.120 --> 32:22.680\n Yes, but that's it.\n\n32:22.680 --> 32:23.680\n You know exactly.\n\n32:23.680 --> 32:28.320\n You take the derivative for translation and predicate.\n\n32:28.320 --> 32:31.040\n This should be kept.\n\n32:31.040 --> 32:32.440\n So that's a single predicate.\n\n32:32.440 --> 32:34.200\n But humans discovered that one.\n\n32:34.200 --> 32:35.760\n Or at least.\n\n32:35.760 --> 32:36.240\n Not it.\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:37.120\n That is a risk.\n\n32:37.120 --> 32:38.960\n Not too many predicates.\n\n32:38.960 --> 32:43.720\n And that is big story because Jan did it 25 years ago\n\n32:43.720 --> 32:50.160\n and nothing so clear was added to deep network.\n\n32:50.160 --> 32:55.400\n And then I don't understand why we\n\n32:55.400 --> 32:58.400\n should talk about deep network instead of talking\n\n32:58.400 --> 33:02.840\n about piecewise linear functions which keeps this predicate.\n\n33:02.840 --> 33:08.720\n Well, a counter argument is that maybe the amount\n\n33:08.720 --> 33:14.480\n of predicates necessary to solve general intelligence,\n\n33:14.480 --> 33:16.720\n say in the space of images, doing\n\n33:16.720 --> 33:20.640\n efficient recognition of handwritten digits\n\n33:20.640 --> 33:22.400\n is very small.\n\n33:22.400 --> 33:26.840\n And so we shouldn't be so obsessed about finding.\n\n33:26.840 --> 33:30.720\n We'll find other good predicates like convolution, for example.\n\n33:30.720 --> 33:33.880\n There has been other advancements\n\n33:33.880 --> 33:37.400\n like if you look at the work with attention,\n\n33:37.400 --> 33:40.720\n there's intentional mechanisms in especially used\n\n33:40.720 --> 33:44.160\n in natural language focusing the network's ability\n\n33:44.160 --> 33:47.640\n to learn at which part of the input to look at.\n\n33:47.640 --> 33:51.000\n The thing is, there's other things besides predicates\n\n33:51.000 --> 33:55.280\n that are important for the actual engineering mechanism\n\n33:55.280 --> 33:57.240\n of showing how much you can really\n\n33:57.240 --> 34:02.120\n do given these predicates.\n\n34:02.120 --> 34:04.360\n I mean, that's essentially the work of deep learning\n\n34:04.360 --> 34:09.000\n is constructing architectures that are able to be,\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:13.720\n given the training data, to be able to converge\n\n34:13.720 --> 34:22.920\n towards a function that can generalize well.\n\n34:22.920 --> 34:24.400\n It's an engineering problem.\n\n34:24.400 --> 34:26.120\n Yeah, I understand.\n\n34:26.120 --> 34:29.840\n But let's talk not on emotional level,\n\n34:29.840 --> 34:31.920\n but on a mathematical level.\n\n34:31.920 --> 34:36.480\n You have set of piecewise linear functions.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:42.040\n It is all possible neural networks.\n\n34:42.040 --> 34:44.040\n It's just piecewise linear functions.\n\n34:44.040 --> 34:45.360\n It's many, many pieces.\n\n34:45.360 --> 34:47.640\n Large number of piecewise linear functions.\n\n34:47.640 --> 34:48.640\n Exactly.\n\n34:48.640 --> 34:49.440\n Very large.\n\n34:49.440 --> 34:50.160\n Very large.\n\n34:50.160 --> 34:51.800\n Almost feels like too large.\n\n34:51.800 --> 34:56.160\n It's still simpler than, say, convolution,\n\n34:56.160 --> 34:59.040\n than reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which\n\n34:59.040 --> 35:00.920\n have a Hilbert set of functions.\n\n35:00.920 --> 35:02.960\n What's Hilbert space?\n\n35:02.960 --> 35:07.040\n It's space with infinite number of coordinates,\n\n35:07.040 --> 35:11.840\n say, or function for expansion, something like that.\n\n35:11.840 --> 35:14.760\n So it's much richer.\n\n35:14.760 --> 35:17.520\n And when I'm talking about closed form solution,\n\n35:17.520 --> 35:20.760\n I'm talking about this set of function,\n\n35:20.760 --> 35:29.760\n not piecewise linear set, which is particular case of it\n\n35:29.760 --> 35:31.000\n is small part.\n\n35:31.000 --> 35:32.960\n So neural networks is a small part\n\n35:32.960 --> 35:35.960\n of the space of functions you're talking about.\n\n35:35.960 --> 35:39.160\n Say, small set of functions.\n\n35:39.160 --> 35:40.600\n Let me take that.\n\n35:40.600 --> 35:42.080\n But it is fine.\n\n35:42.080 --> 35:42.760\n It is fine.\n\n35:42.760 --> 35:46.560\n I don't want to discuss the small or big.\n\n35:46.560 --> 35:47.920\n You take advantage.\n\n35:47.920 --> 35:51.040\n So you have some set of functions.\n\n35:51.040 --> 35:55.320\n So now, when you're trying to create architecture,\n\n35:55.320 --> 35:58.800\n you would like to create admissible set of functions,\n\n35:58.800 --> 36:03.280\n which all your tricks to use not all functions,\n\n36:03.280 --> 36:07.200\n but some subset of this set of functions.\n\n36:07.200 --> 36:10.040\n Say, when you're introducing convolutional net,\n\n36:10.040 --> 36:16.440\n it is way to make this subset useful for you.\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:19.760\n But from my point of view, convolutional,\n\n36:19.760 --> 36:24.800\n it is something you want to keep some invariants,\n\n36:24.800 --> 36:27.920\n say, translation invariants.\n\n36:27.920 --> 36:35.440\n But now, if you understand this and you cannot explain\n\n36:35.440 --> 36:41.240\n on the level of ideas what neural network does,\n\n36:41.240 --> 36:44.360\n you should agree that it is much better\n\n36:44.360 --> 36:46.640\n to have a set of functions.\n\n36:46.640 --> 36:51.040\n And they say, this set of functions should be admissible.\n\n36:51.040 --> 36:53.640\n It must keep this invariant, this invariant,\n\n36:53.640 --> 36:55.200\n and that invariant.\n\n36:55.200 --> 36:58.240\n You know that as soon as you incorporate\n\n36:58.240 --> 37:01.160\n new invariant set of function, because smaller and smaller\n\n37:01.160 --> 37:02.080\n and smaller.\n\n37:02.080 --> 37:06.640\n But all the invariants are specified by you, the human.\n\n37:06.640 --> 37:12.400\n Yeah, but what I hope that there is a standard predicate,\n\n37:12.400 --> 37:17.520\n like PROPSHOW, that's what I want\n\n37:17.520 --> 37:19.560\n to find for digit recognition.\n\n37:19.560 --> 37:22.920\n If we start, it is completely new area,\n\n37:22.920 --> 37:25.800\n what is intelligence about on the level,\n\n37:25.800 --> 37:32.600\n starting from Plato's idea, what is world of ideas.\n\n37:32.600 --> 37:36.640\n And I believe that is not too many.\n\n37:36.640 --> 37:40.680\n But it is amusing that mathematicians doing something,\n\n37:40.680 --> 37:44.000\n a neural network in general function,\n\n37:44.000 --> 37:48.720\n but people from literature, from art, they use this all\n\n37:48.720 --> 37:49.400\n the time.\n\n37:49.400 --> 37:50.040\n That's right.\n\n37:50.040 --> 37:57.000\n Invariants saying, it is great how people describe music.\n\n37:57.000 --> 37:58.720\n We should learn from that.\n\n37:58.720 --> 38:02.000\n And something on this level.\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:09.200\n But so why Vladimir Propp, who was just theoretical,\n\n38:09.200 --> 38:12.960\n who studied theoretical literature, he found that.\n\n38:12.960 --> 38:13.720\n You know what?\n\n38:13.720 --> 38:15.200\n Let me throw that right back at you,\n\n38:15.200 --> 38:17.280\n because there's a little bit of a,\n\n38:17.280 --> 38:21.000\n that's less mathematical and more emotional, philosophical,\n\n38:21.000 --> 38:22.680\n Vladimir Propp.\n\n38:22.680 --> 38:24.920\n I mean, he wasn't doing math.\n\n38:24.920 --> 38:26.840\n No.\n\n38:26.840 --> 38:30.160\n And you just said another emotional statement,\n\n38:30.160 --> 38:35.760\n which is you believe that this Plato world of ideas is small.\n\n38:35.760 --> 38:36.920\n I hope.\n\n38:36.920 --> 38:38.680\n I hope.\n\n38:38.680 --> 38:42.160\n Do you, what's your intuition, though?\n\n38:42.160 --> 38:44.600\n If we can linger on it.\n\n38:44.600 --> 38:48.520\n You know, it is not just small or big.\n\n38:48.520 --> 38:50.520\n I know exactly.\n\n38:50.520 --> 38:56.880\n Then when I introducing some predicate,\n\n38:56.880 --> 38:59.760\n I decrease set of functions.\n\n38:59.760 --> 39:04.040\n But my goal to decrease set of function much.\n\n39:04.040 --> 39:05.000\n By as much as possible.\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.480\n By as much as possible.\n\n39:07.480 --> 39:11.400\n Good predicate, which does this, then\n\n39:11.400 --> 39:15.560\n I should choose next predicate, which decrease set\n\n39:15.560 --> 39:17.320\n as much as possible.\n\n39:17.320 --> 39:21.400\n So set of good predicate, it is such\n\n39:21.400 --> 39:27.880\n that they decrease this amount of admissible function.\n\n39:27.880 --> 39:30.520\n So if each good predicate significantly\n\n39:30.520 --> 39:32.640\n reduces the set of admissible functions,\n\n39:32.640 --> 39:35.560\n that there naturally should not be that many good predicates.\n\n39:35.560 --> 39:43.040\n No, but if you reduce very well the VC dimension\n\n39:43.040 --> 39:46.760\n of the function, of admissible set of function, it's small.\n\n39:46.760 --> 39:52.960\n And you need not too much training data to do well.\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:56.760\n And VC dimension, by the way, is some measure of capacity\n\n39:56.760 --> 39:57.720\n of this set of functions.\n\n39:57.720 --> 39:59.400\n Right.\n\n39:59.400 --> 40:01.960\n Roughly speaking, how many function in this set.\n\n40:01.960 --> 40:03.880\n So you're decreasing, decreasing.\n\n40:03.880 --> 40:08.160\n And it makes easy for you to find function\n\n40:08.160 --> 40:10.200\n you're looking for.\n\n40:10.200 --> 40:14.480\n But the most important part, to create good admissible set\n\n40:14.480 --> 40:15.680\n of functions.\n\n40:15.680 --> 40:18.800\n And it probably, there are many ways.\n\n40:18.800 --> 40:25.880\n But the good predicates such that they can do that.\n\n40:25.880 --> 40:30.520\n So for this duck, you should know a little bit about duck.\n\n40:30.520 --> 40:35.280\n Because what are the three fundamental laws of ducks?\n\n40:35.280 --> 40:38.360\n Looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck.\n\n40:38.360 --> 40:41.160\n You should know something about ducks to be able to.\n\n40:41.160 --> 40:42.480\n Not necessarily.\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:44.920\n Looks like, say, horse.\n\n40:44.920 --> 40:46.520\n It's also good.\n\n40:46.520 --> 40:49.840\n So it's not, it generalizes from ducks.\n\n40:49.840 --> 40:54.280\n And talk like, and make sound like horse or something.\n\n40:54.280 --> 40:57.320\n And run like horse, and moves like horse.\n\n40:57.320 --> 41:02.000\n It is general, it is general predicate\n\n41:02.000 --> 41:04.560\n that this applied to duck.\n\n41:04.560 --> 41:09.800\n But for duck, you can say, play chess like duck.\n\n41:09.800 --> 41:11.520\n You cannot say play chess like duck.\n\n41:11.520 --> 41:12.600\n Why not?\n\n41:12.600 --> 41:15.680\n So you're saying you can, but that would not be a good.\n\n41:15.680 --> 41:18.160\n No, you will not reduce a lot of functions.\n\n41:18.160 --> 41:19.760\n You would not do, yeah, you would not\n\n41:19.760 --> 41:21.600\n reduce the set of functions.\n\n41:21.600 --> 41:26.760\n So you can, the story is formal story, mathematical story.\n\n41:26.760 --> 41:31.120\n Is that you can use any function you want as a predicate.\n\n41:31.120 --> 41:33.160\n But some of them are good, some of them are not,\n\n41:33.160 --> 41:36.880\n because some of them reduce a lot of functions\n\n41:36.880 --> 41:39.720\n to admissible set of some of them.\n\n41:39.720 --> 41:41.440\n But the question is, and I'll probably\n\n41:41.440 --> 41:45.680\n keep asking this question, but how do we find such,\n\n41:45.680 --> 41:47.360\n what's your intuition?\n\n41:47.360 --> 41:49.400\n Handwritten recognition.\n\n41:49.400 --> 41:52.600\n How do we find the answer to your challenge?\n\n41:52.600 --> 41:55.840\n Yeah, I understand it like that.\n\n41:55.840 --> 41:57.800\n I understand what.\n\n41:57.800 --> 41:59.160\n What defined?\n\n41:59.160 --> 42:01.680\n What it means, I knew predicate.\n\n42:01.680 --> 42:02.720\n Yeah.\n\n42:02.720 --> 42:06.160\n Like guy who understand music can say this word,\n\n42:06.160 --> 42:09.520\n which he described when he listened to music.\n\n42:09.520 --> 42:11.600\n He understand music.\n\n42:11.600 --> 42:15.480\n He use not too many different, oh, you can do like prop.\n\n42:15.480 --> 42:17.280\n You can make collection.\n\n42:17.280 --> 42:20.920\n What he talking about music, about this, about that.\n\n42:20.920 --> 42:24.960\n It's not too many different situation he described.\n\n42:24.960 --> 42:26.920\n Because we mentioned Vladimir prop a bunch.\n\n42:26.920 --> 42:29.920\n Let me just mention, there's a sequence of 31\n\n42:33.640 --> 42:36.880\n structural notions that are common in stories.\n\n42:36.880 --> 42:37.720\n And I think.\n\n42:37.720 --> 42:38.560\n You call it units.\n\n42:38.560 --> 42:39.400\n Units.\n\n42:39.400 --> 42:40.480\n And I think they resonate.\n\n42:40.480 --> 42:43.600\n I mean, it starts just to give an example,\n\n42:43.600 --> 42:46.040\n obsession, a member of the hero's community,\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:48.920\n a family leaves the security of the home environment.\n\n42:48.920 --> 42:51.040\n Then it goes to the interdiction,\n\n42:51.040 --> 42:54.520\n a forbidding edict or command is passed upon the hero.\n\n42:54.520 --> 42:55.360\n Don't go there.\n\n42:55.360 --> 42:56.640\n Don't do this.\n\n42:56.640 --> 42:58.680\n The hero is warned against some action.\n\n42:58.680 --> 43:03.680\n Then step three, violation of interdiction.\n\n43:05.280 --> 43:07.600\n Break the rules, break out on your own.\n\n43:07.600 --> 43:09.200\n Then reconnaissance.\n\n43:09.200 --> 43:11.400\n The villain makes an effort to attain knowledge,\n\n43:11.400 --> 43:13.160\n needing to fulfill their plan, so on.\n\n43:13.160 --> 43:18.160\n It goes on like this, ends in a wedding, number 31.\n\n43:19.480 --> 43:20.640\n Happily ever after.\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:25.640\n No, he just gave description of all situations.\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.160\n He understands this world.\n\n43:28.160 --> 43:29.280\n Of folktales.\n\n43:29.280 --> 43:33.160\n Yeah, not folktales, but stories.\n\n43:33.160 --> 43:36.560\n And these stories not in just folktales.\n\n43:36.560 --> 43:39.960\n These stories in detective serials as well.\n\n43:40.880 --> 43:42.200\n And probably in our lives.\n\n43:42.200 --> 43:43.760\n We probably live.\n\n43:43.760 --> 43:45.040\n Read this.\n\n43:45.040 --> 43:51.040\n And then they wrote that this predicate is good\n\n43:52.040 --> 43:53.600\n for different situation.\n\n43:54.800 --> 43:57.920\n From movie, for theater.\n\n43:57.920 --> 44:00.640\n By the way, there's also criticism, right?\n\n44:00.640 --> 44:03.840\n There's an other way to interpret narratives\n\n44:03.840 --> 44:08.840\n from Claude Levi Strauss.\n\n44:09.880 --> 44:10.880\n I don't know.\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:12.520\n I am not in this business.\n\n44:12.520 --> 44:14.360\n No, I know, it's theoretical literature,\n\n44:14.360 --> 44:15.840\n but it's looking at paradigms behind things.\n\n44:15.840 --> 44:20.120\n It's always the discussion, yeah.\n\n44:20.120 --> 44:23.800\n But at least there is units.\n\n44:23.800 --> 44:27.160\n It's not too many units that can describe.\n\n44:27.160 --> 44:30.840\n But this guy probably gives another units.\n\n44:30.840 --> 44:31.680\n Or another way of...\n\n44:31.680 --> 44:34.400\n Exactly, another set of units.\n\n44:34.400 --> 44:35.920\n Another set of predicates.\n\n44:35.920 --> 44:37.560\n It doesn't matter how.\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:39.240\n But they exist.\n\n44:40.120 --> 44:40.960\n Probably.\n\n44:40.960 --> 44:45.960\n My question is, whether given those units,\n\n44:46.240 --> 44:49.480\n whether without our human brains to interpret these units,\n\n44:50.360 --> 44:53.480\n they would still hold as much power as they have.\n\n44:53.480 --> 44:56.200\n Meaning, are those units enough\n\n44:56.200 --> 44:58.840\n when we give them to an alien species?\n\n44:58.840 --> 45:00.320\n Let me ask you.\n\n45:00.320 --> 45:05.320\n Do you understand digit images?\n\n45:06.280 --> 45:07.600\n No, I don't understand.\n\n45:07.600 --> 45:08.640\n No, no, no.\n\n45:08.640 --> 45:11.160\n When you can recognize these digit images,\n\n45:11.160 --> 45:13.320\n it means that you understand.\n\n45:13.320 --> 45:14.160\n Yes, exactly.\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:17.280\n You understand characters, you understand...\n\n45:17.280 --> 45:18.920\n No, no, no, no.\n\n45:22.720 --> 45:25.480\n It's the imitation versus understanding question,\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:28.360\n because I don't understand the mechanism\n\n45:28.360 --> 45:29.200\n by which I understand.\n\n45:29.200 --> 45:30.040\n No, no, no.\n\n45:30.040 --> 45:32.760\n I'm not talking about, I'm talking about predicates.\n\n45:32.760 --> 45:35.120\n You understand that it involves symmetry,\n\n45:35.120 --> 45:37.400\n maybe structure, maybe something else.\n\n45:37.400 --> 45:38.720\n I cannot formulate.\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:43.640\n I just was able to find symmetries, degree of symmetries.\n\n45:43.640 --> 45:44.480\n That's really good.\n\n45:44.480 --> 45:46.360\n So this is a good line.\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:50.560\n I feel like I understand the basic elements\n\n45:50.560 --> 45:54.280\n of what makes a good hand recognition system my own.\n\n45:54.280 --> 45:56.440\n Like symmetry connects with me.\n\n45:56.440 --> 45:59.120\n It seems like that's a very powerful predicate.\n\n45:59.120 --> 46:02.400\n My question is, is there a lot more going on\n\n46:02.400 --> 46:04.480\n that we're not able to introspect?\n\n46:04.480 --> 46:09.480\n Maybe I need to be able to understand\n\n46:09.600 --> 46:13.040\n a huge amount in the world of ideas,\n\n46:14.520 --> 46:18.400\n thousands of predicates, millions of predicates\n\n46:18.400 --> 46:20.600\n in order to do hand recognition.\n\n46:20.600 --> 46:21.520\n I don't think so.\n\n46:23.200 --> 46:26.560\n So both your hope and your intuition\n\n46:26.560 --> 46:28.960\n are such that very few predicates are enough.\n\n46:28.960 --> 46:33.480\n You're using digits, you're using examples as well.\n\n46:33.480 --> 46:38.480\n Theory says that if you will use all possible functions\n\n46:43.480 --> 46:46.360\n from Hilbert space, all possible predicate,\n\n46:46.360 --> 46:48.000\n you don't need training data.\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:53.840\n You just will have admissible set of function\n\n46:53.840 --> 46:56.060\n which contain one function.\n\n46:56.060 --> 46:57.160\n Yes.\n\n46:57.160 --> 47:01.160\n So the trade off is when you're not using all predicates,\n\n47:01.160 --> 47:03.040\n you're only using a few good predicates\n\n47:03.040 --> 47:05.000\n you need to have some training data.\n\n47:05.000 --> 47:06.800\n Yes, exactly.\n\n47:06.800 --> 47:08.440\n The more good predicates you have,\n\n47:08.440 --> 47:09.680\n the less training data you need.\n\n47:09.680 --> 47:10.960\n Exactly.\n\n47:10.960 --> 47:12.240\n That is intelligent.\n\n47:13.280 --> 47:17.400\n Still, okay, I'm gonna keep asking the same dumb question,\n\n47:17.400 --> 47:20.200\n handwritten recognition to solve the challenge.\n\n47:20.200 --> 47:21.920\n You kind of propose a challenge that says\n\n47:21.920 --> 47:26.920\n we should be able to get state of the art MNIST error rates\n\n47:27.100 --> 47:31.480\n by using very few, 60, maybe fewer examples per digit.\n\n47:31.480 --> 47:35.920\n What kind of predicates do you think it will look like?\n\n47:35.920 --> 47:37.520\n That is the challenge.\n\n47:37.520 --> 47:39.760\n So people who will solve this problem,\n\n47:39.760 --> 47:41.480\n they will answer.\n\n47:41.480 --> 47:44.720\n Do you think they'll be able to answer it\n\n47:44.720 --> 47:46.520\n in a human explainable way?\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:50.760\n They just need to write function, that's it.\n\n47:50.760 --> 47:54.280\n But so can that function be written, I guess,\n\n47:54.280 --> 47:58.680\n by an automated reasoning system?\n\n47:58.680 --> 48:01.080\n Whether we're talking about a neural network\n\n48:01.080 --> 48:05.040\n learning a particular function or another mechanism?\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:08.520\n No, I'm not against neural network.\n\n48:08.520 --> 48:11.600\n I'm against admissible set of function\n\n48:11.600 --> 48:13.720\n which create neural network.\n\n48:13.720 --> 48:15.220\n You did it by hand.\n\n48:16.360 --> 48:21.360\n You don't do it by invariance, by predicate, by reason.\n\n48:24.600 --> 48:26.400\n But neural networks can then reverse,\n\n48:26.400 --> 48:29.840\n do the reverse step of helping you find a function\n\n48:29.840 --> 48:33.600\n that just, the task of a neural network\n\n48:33.600 --> 48:38.160\n is to find a disentangled representation, for example,\n\n48:38.160 --> 48:42.120\n that they call, is to find that one predicate function\n\n48:42.120 --> 48:45.180\n that's really capture some kind of essence.\n\n48:45.180 --> 48:48.600\n One, not the entire essence, but one very useful essence\n\n48:48.600 --> 48:52.640\n of this particular visual space.\n\n48:52.640 --> 48:53.840\n Do you think that's possible?\n\n48:53.840 --> 48:58.620\n Listen, I'm grasping, hoping there's an automated way\n\n48:58.620 --> 49:00.300\n to find good predicates, right?\n\n49:00.300 --> 49:03.000\n So the question is what are the mechanisms\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:05.760\n of finding good predicates, ideas\n\n49:05.760 --> 49:08.040\n that you think we should pursue?\n\n49:08.040 --> 49:11.240\n A young grad student listening right now.\n\n49:11.240 --> 49:13.360\n I gave example.\n\n49:13.360 --> 49:18.360\n So find situation where predicate which you're suggesting\n\n49:23.480 --> 49:24.980\n don't create invariant.\n\n49:24.980 --> 49:28.820\n It's like in physics.\n\n49:28.820 --> 49:33.820\n Find situation where existing theory cannot explain it.\n\n49:37.180 --> 49:39.420\n Find situation where the existing theory\n\n49:39.420 --> 49:40.260\n can't explain it.\n\n49:40.260 --> 49:42.780\n So you're finding contradictions.\n\n49:42.780 --> 49:46.140\n Find contradiction, and then remove this contradiction.\n\n49:46.140 --> 49:48.940\n But in my case, what means contradiction,\n\n49:48.940 --> 49:53.500\n you find function which, if you will use this function,\n\n49:53.500 --> 49:55.060\n you're not keeping invariants.\n\n49:56.900 --> 50:01.300\n This is really the process of discovering contradictions.\n\n50:01.300 --> 50:02.140\n Yeah.\n\n50:04.060 --> 50:05.900\n It is like in physics.\n\n50:05.900 --> 50:09.800\n Find situation where you have contradiction\n\n50:09.800 --> 50:14.800\n for one of the property, for one of the predicate.\n\n50:15.500 --> 50:19.020\n Then include this predicate, making invariants,\n\n50:19.020 --> 50:20.460\n and solve again this problem.\n\n50:20.460 --> 50:22.100\n Now you don't have contradiction.\n\n50:22.100 --> 50:27.100\n But it is not the best way, probably, I don't know,\n\n50:30.380 --> 50:31.980\n to looking for predicate.\n\n50:31.980 --> 50:33.580\n That's just one way, okay.\n\n50:33.580 --> 50:35.900\n That, no, no, it is brute force way.\n\n50:35.900 --> 50:37.300\n The brute force way.\n\n50:37.300 --> 50:42.300\n What about the ideas of what,\n\n50:42.300 --> 50:44.680\n big umbrella term of symbolic AI?\n\n50:45.660 --> 50:48.540\n There's what in the 80s with expert systems,\n\n50:48.540 --> 50:52.380\n sort of logic reasoning based systems.\n\n50:52.380 --> 50:55.700\n Is there hope there to find some,\n\n50:57.020 --> 51:00.500\n through sort of deductive reasoning,\n\n51:00.500 --> 51:04.440\n to find good predicates?\n\n51:05.540 --> 51:06.860\n I don't think so.\n\n51:08.980 --> 51:12.020\n I think that just logic is not enough.\n\n51:12.020 --> 51:14.420\n It's kind of a compelling notion, though.\n\n51:14.420 --> 51:17.620\n You know, that when smart people sit in a room\n\n51:17.620 --> 51:20.360\n and reason through things, it seems compelling.\n\n51:20.360 --> 51:23.560\n And making our machines do the same is also compelling.\n\n51:24.940 --> 51:27.840\n So, everything is very simple.\n\n51:29.420 --> 51:32.880\n When you have infinite number of predicate,\n\n51:34.100 --> 51:38.580\n you can choose the function you want.\n\n51:38.580 --> 51:41.660\n You have invariants and you can choose the function you want.\n\n51:41.660 --> 51:46.660\n But you have to have not too many invariants\n\n51:51.880 --> 51:53.060\n to solve the problem.\n\n51:56.200 --> 51:59.940\n So, and have from infinite number of function\n\n51:59.940 --> 52:02.980\n to select finite number\n\n52:04.120 --> 52:08.460\n and hopefully small number of functions,\n\n52:08.460 --> 52:13.460\n which is good enough to extract small set\n\n52:14.920 --> 52:16.680\n of admissible functions.\n\n52:17.920 --> 52:19.840\n So, they will be admissible, it's for sure,\n\n52:19.840 --> 52:23.880\n because every function just decrease set of function\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:25.680\n and leaving it admissible.\n\n52:25.680 --> 52:27.720\n But it will be small.\n\n52:27.720 --> 52:32.560\n But why do you think logic based systems don't,\n\n52:32.560 --> 52:35.280\n can't help, intuition, not?\n\n52:35.280 --> 52:37.800\n Because you should know reality.\n\n52:37.800 --> 52:39.480\n You should know life.\n\n52:39.480 --> 52:44.280\n This guy like Propp, he knows something.\n\n52:44.280 --> 52:49.280\n And he tried to put in invariant his understanding.\n\n52:49.400 --> 52:51.600\n That's the human, yeah, but see,\n\n52:51.600 --> 52:56.480\n you're putting too much value into Vladimir Propp\n\n52:56.480 --> 52:57.920\n knowing something.\n\n52:57.920 --> 53:02.920\n No, it is, in the story, what means you know life?\n\n53:04.420 --> 53:05.400\n What it means?\n\n53:05.400 --> 53:07.040\n You know common sense.\n\n53:07.040 --> 53:10.400\n No, no, you know something.\n\n53:10.400 --> 53:13.440\n Common sense, it is some rules.\n\n53:13.440 --> 53:14.800\n You think so?\n\n53:14.800 --> 53:17.180\n Common sense is simply rules?\n\n53:17.180 --> 53:21.800\n Common sense is every, it's mortality,\n\n53:21.800 --> 53:26.800\n it's fear of death, it's love, it's spirituality,\n\n53:27.880 --> 53:30.840\n it's happiness and sadness.\n\n53:30.840 --> 53:34.420\n All of it is tied up into understanding gravity,\n\n53:34.420 --> 53:36.840\n which is what we think of as common sense.\n\n53:36.840 --> 53:39.840\n I don't really need to discuss so wide.\n\n53:39.840 --> 53:44.840\n I want to discuss, understand digit recognition.\n\n53:45.440 --> 53:47.640\n Anytime I bring up love and death,\n\n53:47.640 --> 53:51.160\n you bring it back to digit recognition, I like it.\n\n53:51.160 --> 53:55.200\n No, you know, it is durable because there is a challenge.\n\n53:55.200 --> 53:56.040\n Yeah.\n\n53:56.040 --> 53:59.260\n Which I see how to solve it.\n\n53:59.260 --> 54:02.520\n If I will have a student concentrate on this work,\n\n54:02.520 --> 54:04.800\n I will suggest something to solve.\n\n54:04.800 --> 54:07.000\n You mean handwritten record?\n\n54:07.000 --> 54:10.800\n Yeah, it's a beautifully simple, elegant, and yet.\n\n54:10.800 --> 54:13.440\n I think that I know invariants which will solve this.\n\n54:13.440 --> 54:14.280\n You do?\n\n54:14.280 --> 54:15.920\n I think so, yes.\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:20.920\n But it is not universal, it is maybe,\n\n54:21.600 --> 54:24.160\n I want some universal invariants\n\n54:24.160 --> 54:27.360\n which are good not only for digit recognition,\n\n54:27.360 --> 54:28.760\n for image understanding.\n\n54:28.760 --> 54:33.760\n So let me ask, how hard do you think\n\n54:34.160 --> 54:37.100\n is 2D image understanding?\n\n54:38.360 --> 54:42.620\n So if we, we can kind of intuit handwritten recognition.\n\n54:43.800 --> 54:48.800\n How big of a step, leap, journey is it from that?\n\n54:49.160 --> 54:51.920\n If I gave you good, if I solved your challenge\n\n54:51.920 --> 54:53.600\n for handwritten recognition,\n\n54:53.600 --> 54:56.480\n how long would my journey then be from that\n\n54:56.480 --> 54:59.360\n to understanding more general, natural images?\n\n54:59.360 --> 55:01.920\n Immediately, you will understand this\n\n55:01.920 --> 55:04.020\n as soon as you will make a record.\n\n55:05.400 --> 55:07.720\n Because it is not for free.\n\n55:07.720 --> 55:12.720\n As soon as you will create several invariants\n\n55:13.000 --> 55:18.000\n which will help you to get the same performance\n\n55:20.120 --> 55:23.880\n that the best neural net did using 100,\n\n55:23.880 --> 55:26.940\n there might be more than 100 times less examples,\n\n55:27.760 --> 55:31.220\n you have to have something smart to do that.\n\n55:31.220 --> 55:32.220\n And you're saying?\n\n55:32.220 --> 55:35.160\n That is invariant, it is predicate.\n\n55:35.160 --> 55:38.540\n Because you should put some idea how to do that.\n\n55:39.420 --> 55:42.380\n But okay, let me just pause.\n\n55:42.380 --> 55:44.520\n Maybe it's a trivial point, maybe not.\n\n55:44.520 --> 55:48.840\n But handwritten recognition feels like a 2D,\n\n55:48.840 --> 55:50.440\n two dimensional problem.\n\n55:50.440 --> 55:55.360\n And it seems like how much complicated is the fact\n\n55:55.360 --> 56:00.360\n that most images are projection of a three dimensional world\n\n56:00.400 --> 56:03.100\n onto a 2D plane.\n\n56:03.100 --> 56:05.880\n It feels like for a three dimensional world,\n\n56:05.880 --> 56:08.660\n we need to start understanding common sense\n\n56:08.660 --> 56:10.920\n in order to understand an image.\n\n56:11.960 --> 56:16.960\n It's no longer visual shape and symmetry.\n\n56:17.480 --> 56:19.920\n It's having to start to understand concepts\n\n56:19.920 --> 56:22.120\n of, understand life.\n\n56:22.120 --> 56:27.120\n Yeah, you're talking that there are different invariant,\n\n56:27.320 --> 56:28.920\n different predicate, yeah.\n\n56:28.920 --> 56:32.480\n And potentially much larger number.\n\n56:32.480 --> 56:36.360\n You know, maybe, but let's start from simple.\n\n56:36.360 --> 56:38.200\n Yeah, but you said that it would be immediate.\n\n56:38.200 --> 56:41.360\n No, you know, I cannot think about things\n\n56:41.360 --> 56:43.280\n which I don't understand.\n\n56:43.280 --> 56:46.920\n This I understand, but I'm sure that I don't understand\n\n56:46.920 --> 56:48.440\n everything there.\n\n56:48.440 --> 56:50.440\n Yeah, that's the difference.\n\n56:50.440 --> 56:54.360\n Do as simple as possible, but not simpler.\n\n56:54.360 --> 56:56.520\n And that is exact case.\n\n56:56.520 --> 56:57.440\n With handwritten.\n\n56:57.440 --> 56:58.940\n With handwritten.\n\n56:58.940 --> 57:01.640\n Yeah, but that's the difference between you and I.\n\n57:04.880 --> 57:07.920\n I welcome and enjoy thinking about things\n\n57:07.920 --> 57:09.880\n I completely don't understand.\n\n57:09.880 --> 57:12.380\n Because to me, it's a natural extension\n\n57:12.380 --> 57:15.140\n without having solved handwritten recognition\n\n57:15.140 --> 57:20.140\n to wonder how difficult is the next step\n\n57:23.280 --> 57:25.680\n of understanding 2D, 3D images.\n\n57:25.680 --> 57:29.240\n Because ultimately, while the science of intelligence\n\n57:29.240 --> 57:31.680\n is fascinating, it's also fascinating to see\n\n57:31.680 --> 57:34.680\n how that maps to the engineering of intelligence.\n\n57:34.680 --> 57:39.280\n And recognizing handwritten digits is not,\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:43.080\n doesn't help you, it might, it may not help you\n\n57:43.080 --> 57:46.560\n with the problem of general intelligence.\n\n57:46.560 --> 57:47.400\n We don't know.\n\n57:47.400 --> 57:48.240\n It'll help you a little bit.\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:49.080\n We don't know how much.\n\n57:49.080 --> 57:49.900\n It's unclear.\n\n57:49.900 --> 57:50.740\n It's unclear.\n\n57:50.740 --> 57:51.580\n Yeah.\n\n57:51.580 --> 57:52.400\n It might very much.\n\n57:52.400 --> 57:53.240\n But I would like to make a remark.\n\n57:53.240 --> 57:54.080\n Yes.\n\n57:54.080 --> 57:58.760\n I start not from very primitive problem,\n\n57:58.760 --> 58:03.120\n make a challenge problem.\n\n58:03.120 --> 58:07.640\n I start with very general problem, with PLATO.\n\n58:07.640 --> 58:10.640\n So you understand, and it comes from PLATO\n\n58:10.640 --> 58:14.000\n to digit recognition.\n\n58:14.000 --> 58:18.120\n So you basically took PLATO and the world\n\n58:18.120 --> 58:22.080\n of forms and ideas and mapped and projected\n\n58:22.080 --> 58:25.380\n into the clearest, simplest formulation\n\n58:25.380 --> 58:26.820\n of that big world.\n\n58:26.820 --> 58:30.680\n You know, I would say that I did not understand PLATO\n\n58:31.560 --> 58:36.560\n until recently, and until I consider\n\n58:36.560 --> 58:40.800\n the convergence and then predicate,\n\n58:40.800 --> 58:43.440\n and then, oh, this is what PLATO told.\n\n58:45.520 --> 58:46.360\n So.\n\n58:46.360 --> 58:47.180\n Can you linger on that?\n\n58:47.180 --> 58:50.200\n Like why, how do you think about this world of ideas\n\n58:50.200 --> 58:52.040\n and world of things in PLATO?\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:54.160\n No, it is metaphor.\n\n58:54.160 --> 58:55.000\n It is.\n\n58:55.000 --> 58:55.840\n It's a metaphor, for sure.\n\n58:55.840 --> 58:56.680\n Yeah.\n\n58:56.680 --> 58:57.500\n It's a compelling, it's a poetic\n\n58:57.500 --> 58:58.340\n and a beautiful metaphor.\n\n58:58.340 --> 58:59.180\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n58:59.180 --> 59:00.560\n But what, can you?\n\n59:00.560 --> 59:04.960\n But it is a way how you should try to understand\n\n59:04.960 --> 59:07.880\n how to talk ideas in the world.\n\n59:07.880 --> 59:09.360\n So from my point of view,\n\n59:11.240 --> 59:14.900\n it is very clear, but it is lying.\n\n59:14.900 --> 59:17.520\n All the time, people looking for that.\n\n59:17.520 --> 59:22.520\n Say, PLATO, then Hegel, whatever reasonable it exists,\n\n59:24.320 --> 59:26.700\n whatever exists, it is reasonable.\n\n59:26.700 --> 59:30.240\n I don't know what he have in mind reasonable.\n\n59:30.240 --> 59:31.600\n Right, this philosophers again,\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:33.320\n their words. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n59:33.320 --> 59:37.120\n It is next stop of Wigner.\n\n59:37.120 --> 59:40.760\n That mathematics understand something of reality.\n\n59:40.760 --> 59:42.480\n It is the same PLATO line.\n\n59:43.440 --> 59:47.120\n And then it comes suddenly to Vladimir Propp.\n\n59:48.160 --> 59:52.900\n Look, 31 ideas, 31 units, and this corrects everything.\n\n59:54.320 --> 59:59.320\n There's abstractions, ideas that represent our world.\n\n59:59.320 --> 1:00:03.320\n Our world, and we should always try to reach into that.\n\n1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:07.520\n Yeah, but you should make a projection on reality.\n\n1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:11.820\n But understanding is, it is abstract ideas.\n\n1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:15.880\n You have in your mind several abstract ideas\n\n1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:17.760\n which you can apply to reality.\n\n1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:19.160\n And reality in this case,\n\n1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:21.400\n so if you look at machine learning as data.\n\n1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.720\n This example, data.\n\n1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:24.080\n Data.\n\n1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:26.280\n Okay, let me put this on you\n\n1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:28.320\n because I'm an emotional creature.\n\n1:00:28.320 --> 1:00:30.800\n I'm not a mathematical creature like you.\n\n1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:33.400\n I find compelling the idea,\n\n1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:36.680\n forget the space, the sea of functions.\n\n1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:39.520\n There's also a sea of data in the world.\n\n1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:42.320\n And I find compelling that there might be,\n\n1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:43.520\n like you said, teacher,\n\n1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:49.240\n small examples of data that are most useful\n\n1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:53.000\n for discovering good,\n\n1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.560\n whether it's predicates or good functions,\n\n1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:00.320\n that the selection of data may be a powerful journey,\n\n1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:03.760\n a useful, you know, coming up with a mechanism\n\n1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:06.500\n for selecting good data might be useful too.\n\n1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:12.440\n Do you find this idea of finding the right data set\n\n1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:14.000\n interesting at all?\n\n1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.740\n Or do you kind of take the data set as a given?\n\n1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:22.680\n I think that it is, you know, my theme is very simple.\n\n1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.900\n You have huge set of functions.\n\n1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:30.900\n If you will apply, and you have not too many data,\n\n1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:36.500\n if you pick up function which describes this data,\n\n1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:39.940\n you will do not very well.\n\n1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:42.040\n You will.\n\n1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:42.860\n Like randomly pick up.\n\n1:01:42.860 --> 1:01:43.700\n Yeah, you will overfit.\n\n1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:45.420\n Yeah, it will be overfitting.\n\n1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:50.160\n So you should decrease set of function\n\n1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:53.640\n from which you're picking up one.\n\n1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:58.100\n So you should go somehow to admissible set of function.\n\n1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:02.380\n And this, what about weak conversions?\n\n1:02:03.800 --> 1:02:08.040\n So, but from another point of view,\n\n1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:13.040\n to make admissible set of function,\n\n1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:15.320\n you need just a DG, just function\n\n1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:19.400\n which you will take in inner product,\n\n1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:24.400\n which you will measure property of your function.\n\n1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:31.200\n And that is how it works.\n\n1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:32.720\n No, I get it, I get it, I understand it,\n\n1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:34.960\n but do you, the reality is.\n\n1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:39.160\n But let's think about examples.\n\n1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:41.880\n You have huge set of function,\n\n1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:44.640\n and you have several examples.\n\n1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:49.640\n If you just trying to keep, take function\n\n1:02:50.360 --> 1:02:55.360\n which satisfies these examples, you still will overfit.\n\n1:02:56.620 --> 1:02:59.320\n You need decrease, you need admissible set of function.\n\n1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:04.320\n Absolutely, but what, say you have more data than functions.\n\n1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:08.280\n So sort of consider the, I mean,\n\n1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:09.760\n maybe not more data than functions,\n\n1:03:09.760 --> 1:03:12.040\n because that's impossible.\n\n1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:15.120\n But what, I was trying to be poetic for a second.\n\n1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:17.200\n I mean, you have a huge amount of data,\n\n1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:19.840\n a huge amount of examples.\n\n1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:22.440\n But amount of function can be even bigger.\n\n1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:24.320\n It can get bigger, I understand.\n\n1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:25.520\n Everything is.\n\n1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:27.560\n There's always a bigger boat.\n\n1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.200\n Full Hilbert space.\n\n1:03:29.200 --> 1:03:31.800\n I got you, but okay.\n\n1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:35.800\n But you don't find the world of data\n\n1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:38.720\n to be an interesting optimization space.\n\n1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:42.300\n Like the optimization should be in the space of functions.\n\n1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:47.080\n Creating admissible set of functions.\n\n1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:48.120\n Admissible set of functions.\n\n1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:52.440\n No, you know, even from the classical business theory,\n\n1:03:54.480 --> 1:03:56.400\n from structure risk minimization,\n\n1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:01.400\n you should organize function in the way\n\n1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:06.560\n that they will be useful for you.\n\n1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:07.560\n Right.\n\n1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:10.280\n And that is admissible set.\n\n1:04:10.280 --> 1:04:12.600\n The way you're thinking about useful\n\n1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:17.000\n is you're given a small set of examples.\n\n1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.040\n Useful small, small set of function\n\n1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:21.800\n which contain function I'm looking for.\n\n1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:25.320\n Yeah, but looking for based on\n\n1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.640\n the empirical set of small examples.\n\n1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:29.640\n Yeah, but that is another story.\n\n1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:31.160\n I don't touch it.\n\n1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:35.720\n Because I believe that this small examples\n\n1:04:35.720 --> 1:04:37.400\n is not too small.\n\n1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:39.200\n Say 60 per class.\n\n1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:41.360\n Law of large numbers works.\n\n1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:43.400\n I don't need uniform law.\n\n1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:46.740\n The story is that in statistics there are two law.\n\n1:04:46.740 --> 1:04:51.120\n Law of large numbers and uniform law of large numbers.\n\n1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:54.760\n So I want to be in situation where I use\n\n1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:58.280\n law of large numbers but not uniform law of large numbers.\n\n1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:01.440\n Right, so 60 is law of large, it's large enough.\n\n1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:05.640\n I hope, no, it still need some evaluations,\n\n1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:07.880\n some bonds.\n\n1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:10.240\n But the idea is the following that\n\n1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:13.120\n if you trust that\n\n1:05:15.580 --> 1:05:20.580\n say this average gives you something close to expectations\n\n1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:26.080\n so you can talk about that, about this predicate.\n\n1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:29.780\n And that is basis of human intelligence.\n\n1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:32.280\n Good predicates is the,\n\n1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:34.880\n the discovery of good predicates is the basis of human intelligence.\n\n1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:39.880\n It is discoverer of your understanding world.\n\n1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:43.580\n Of your methodology of understanding world.\n\n1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:47.240\n Because you have several function\n\n1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:49.080\n which you will apply to reality.\n\n1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:52.480\n Can you say that again?\n\n1:05:52.480 --> 1:05:54.440\n So you're...\n\n1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:57.560\n You have several functions predicate.\n\n1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:00.240\n But they're abstract.\n\n1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:01.080\n Yes.\n\n1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:04.360\n Then you will apply them to reality, to your data.\n\n1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:07.400\n And you will create in this way predicate.\n\n1:06:07.400 --> 1:06:09.640\n Which is useful for your task.\n\n1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:16.420\n But predicate are not related specifically to your task.\n\n1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:17.840\n To this your task.\n\n1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:20.080\n It is abstract functions.\n\n1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:23.240\n Which being applying, applied to...\n\n1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:25.280\n Many tasks that you might be interested in.\n\n1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:27.640\n It might be many tasks, I don't know.\n\n1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:28.640\n Or...\n\n1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:29.960\n Different tasks.\n\n1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:31.640\n Well they should be many tasks, right?\n\n1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:35.680\n I believe like, like in prop case.\n\n1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:38.540\n It was for fairytales, but it's happened everywhere.\n\n1:06:40.080 --> 1:06:42.160\n Okay, so we talked about images a little bit.\n\n1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:45.800\n But, can we talk about Noam Chomsky for a second?\n\n1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:52.280\n No, I believe I...\n\n1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.240\n I don't know him very well.\n\n1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.680\n Personally, well...\n\n1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:57.040\n Not personally, I don't know.\n\n1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:57.880\n His ideas.\n\n1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:58.720\n His ideas.\n\n1:06:58.720 --> 1:06:59.840\n Well let me just say,\n\n1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.360\n do you think language, human language,\n\n1:07:02.360 --> 1:07:05.760\n is essential to expressing ideas?\n\n1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:08.320\n As Noam Chomsky believes.\n\n1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.080\n So like, language is at the core\n\n1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:12.900\n of our formation of predicates.\n\n1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:14.960\n The human language.\n\n1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:18.560\n For me, language and all the story of language\n\n1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.720\n is very complicated.\n\n1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:22.920\n I don't understand this.\n\n1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:24.080\n And I am not...\n\n1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:25.680\n I thought about...\n\n1:07:25.680 --> 1:07:26.520\n Nobody does.\n\n1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.260\n I am not ready to work on that.\n\n1:07:28.260 --> 1:07:30.720\n Because it's so huge.\n\n1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:34.220\n It is not for me, and I believe not for our century.\n\n1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:37.280\n The 21st century.\n\n1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:39.440\n Not for 21st century.\n\n1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:42.160\n You should learn something, a lot of stuff,\n\n1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:45.040\n from simple task like digit recognition.\n\n1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:49.200\n So you think, okay, you think digital recognition,\n\n1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:54.200\n 2D image, how would you more abstractly define\n\n1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:56.440\n digit recognition?\n\n1:07:56.440 --> 1:08:01.440\n It's 2D image, symbol recognition, essentially.\n\n1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:08.080\n I mean, I'm trying to get a sense,\n\n1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:09.680\n sort of thinking about it now,\n\n1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:12.880\n having worked with MNIST forever,\n\n1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:16.040\n how small of a subset is this\n\n1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:18.560\n of the general vision recognition problem\n\n1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:20.440\n and the general intelligence problem?\n\n1:08:21.580 --> 1:08:22.420\n Is it...\n\n1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:25.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:26.360\n Is it a giant subset?\n\n1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:27.840\n Is it not?\n\n1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:30.200\n And how far away is language?\n\n1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:33.420\n You know, let me refer to Einstein.\n\n1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:38.280\n Take the simplest problem, as simple as possible,\n\n1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:39.800\n but not simpler.\n\n1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:43.040\n And this is challenge, this simple problem.\n\n1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:49.280\n But it's simple by idea, but not simple to get it.\n\n1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:55.360\n When you will do this, you will find some predicate,\n\n1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:57.160\n which helps it a bit.\n\n1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:00.040\n Well, yeah, I mean, with Einstein, you can,\n\n1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:04.120\n you look at general relativity,\n\n1:09:04.120 --> 1:09:07.280\n but that doesn't help you with quantum mechanics.\n\n1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:08.760\n That's another story.\n\n1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:11.840\n You don't have any universal instrument.\n\n1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:16.520\n Yes, so I'm trying to wonder which space we're in,\n\n1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:21.120\n whether handwritten recognition is like general relativity,\n\n1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:23.160\n and then language is like quantum mechanics.\n\n1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:27.000\n So you're still gonna have to do a lot of mess\n\n1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.720\n to universalize it.\n\n1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:33.360\n But I'm trying to see,\n\n1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:39.160\n so what's your intuition why handwritten recognition\n\n1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:40.940\n is easier than language?\n\n1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:45.320\n Just, I think a lot of people would agree with that,\n\n1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:50.200\n but if you could elucidate sort of the intuition of why.\n\n1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:55.200\n I don't know, no, I don't think in this direction.\n\n1:09:56.460 --> 1:09:59.560\n I just think in directions that this is problem,\n\n1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:05.120\n which if we will solve it well,\n\n1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.760\n we will create some abstract understanding of images.\n\n1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:19.680\n Maybe not all images.\n\n1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.000\n I would like to talk to guys who doing in real images\n\n1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.280\n in Columbia University.\n\n1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:28.400\n What kind of images, unreal?\n\n1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:29.240\n Real images.\n\n1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:30.060\n Real images.\n\n1:10:30.060 --> 1:10:33.400\n Yeah, what they're ready, is there a predicate,\n\n1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:35.160\n what can be predicate?\n\n1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:40.160\n I still symmetry will play role in real life images,\n\n1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:43.920\n in any real life images, 2D images.\n\n1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:46.320\n Let's talk about 2D images.\n\n1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:51.320\n Because that's what we know.\n\n1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:55.880\n A neural network was created for 2D images.\n\n1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:58.680\n So the people I know in vision science, for example,\n\n1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:01.000\n the people who study human vision,\n\n1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.520\n that they usually go to the world of symbols\n\n1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.360\n and like handwritten recognition,\n\n1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:08.480\n but not really, it's other kinds of symbols\n\n1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:11.560\n to study our visual perception system.\n\n1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:15.160\n As far as I know, not much predicate type of thinking\n\n1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:17.640\n is understood about our vision system.\n\n1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:19.400\n They did not think in this direction.\n\n1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:21.720\n They don't, yeah, but how do you even begin\n\n1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:23.480\n to think in that direction?\n\n1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:26.920\n That's a, I would like to discuss with them.\n\n1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:27.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:32.760\n Because if we will be able to show that it is what working,\n\n1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:40.360\n and theoretical scheme, it's not so bad.\n\n1:11:40.360 --> 1:11:43.360\n So the unfortunate, so if we compare to language,\n\n1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.520\n language is like letters, finite set of letters,\n\n1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:50.480\n and a finite set of ways you can put together those letters.\n\n1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:53.720\n So it feels more amenable to kind of analysis.\n\n1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:58.680\n With natural images, there is so many pixels.\n\n1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:03.680\n No, no, no, letter, language is much, much more complicated.\n\n1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:08.040\n It's involved a lot of different stuff.\n\n1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:13.040\n It's not just understanding of very simple class of tasks.\n\n1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:19.960\n I would like to see list of task with language involved.\n\n1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:23.200\n Yes, so there's a lot of nice benchmarks now\n\n1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:26.480\n in natural language processing from the very trivial,\n\n1:12:27.400 --> 1:12:30.200\n like understanding the elements of a sentence,\n\n1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:33.040\n to question answering, to much more complicated\n\n1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:36.120\n where you talk about open domain dialogue.\n\n1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:39.240\n The natural question is, with handwritten recognition,\n\n1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:42.960\n is really the first step of understanding\n\n1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.600\n visual information.\n\n1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:45.440\n Right.\n\n1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:51.440\n But even our records show that we go in the wrong direction\n\n1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:56.600\n because we need 60,000 digits.\n\n1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:59.680\n So even this first step, so forget about talking\n\n1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:01.880\n about the full journey, this first step\n\n1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:03.280\n should be taking in the right direction.\n\n1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:07.160\n No, no, wrong direction because 60,000 is unacceptable.\n\n1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:11.000\n No, I'm saying it should be taken in the right direction\n\n1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.640\n because 60,000 is not acceptable.\n\n1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:18.440\n If you can talk, it's great, we have half percent of error.\n\n1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:22.720\n And hopefully the step from doing hand recognition\n\n1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:26.760\n using very few examples, the step towards what babies do\n\n1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:30.160\n when they crawl and understand their physical environment.\n\n1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:31.720\n I know you don't know about babies.\n\n1:13:31.720 --> 1:13:36.040\n If you will do from very small examples,\n\n1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:39.560\n you will find principles which are different\n\n1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:43.040\n from what we're using now.\n\n1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:48.320\n And so it's more or less clear.\n\n1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.240\n That means that you will use weak convergence,\n\n1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:54.440\n not just strong convergence.\n\n1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:55.960\n Do you think these principles\n\n1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:01.640\n will naturally be human interpretable?\n\n1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:02.560\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:04.480\n So like when we'll be able to explain them\n\n1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:06.240\n and have a nice presentation to show\n\n1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:10.760\n what those principles are, or are they very,\n\n1:14:10.760 --> 1:14:14.440\n going to be very kind of abstract kinds of functions?\n\n1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.640\n For example, I talked yesterday about symmetry.\n\n1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:18.680\n Yes.\n\n1:14:18.680 --> 1:14:20.440\n And I gave very simple examples.\n\n1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:22.000\n The same will be like that.\n\n1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.680\n You gave like a predicate of a basic for?\n\n1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:25.760\n For symmetries.\n\n1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:29.520\n Yes, for different symmetries and you have for?\n\n1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.840\n Degree of symmetries, that is important.\n\n1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:33.680\n Not just symmetry.\n\n1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:36.280\n Existence doesn't exist, degree of symmetry.\n\n1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:40.240\n Yeah, for handwritten recognition.\n\n1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:45.160\n No, it's not for handwritten, it's for any images.\n\n1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:47.720\n But I would like apply to handwritten.\n\n1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:50.920\n Right, in theory it's more general, okay, okay.\n\n1:14:55.280 --> 1:14:58.160\n So a lot of the things we've been talking about\n\n1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:01.800\n falls, we've been talking about philosophy a little bit,\n\n1:15:01.800 --> 1:15:05.480\n but also about mathematics and statistics.\n\n1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:08.040\n A lot of it falls into this idea,\n\n1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:10.700\n a universal idea of statistical theory of learning.\n\n1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:16.760\n What is the most beautiful and sort of powerful\n\n1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:19.080\n or essential idea you've come across,\n\n1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:22.040\n even just for yourself personally in the world\n\n1:15:22.040 --> 1:15:25.440\n of statistics or statistic theory of learning?\n\n1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:29.480\n Probably uniform convergence, which we did\n\n1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:33.000\n with Alexei Chilvonenkis.\n\n1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000\n Can you describe universal convergence?\n\n1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:39.000\n You have law of large numbers.\n\n1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:44.480\n So for any function, expectation of function,\n\n1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.120\n average of function converged to expectation.\n\n1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:50.520\n But if you have set of functions,\n\n1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:52.340\n for any function it is true.\n\n1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:55.580\n But it should converge simultaneously\n\n1:15:55.580 --> 1:15:57.480\n for all set of functions.\n\n1:15:59.020 --> 1:16:04.020\n And for learning, you need uniform convergence.\n\n1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:08.560\n Just convergence is not enough.\n\n1:16:11.220 --> 1:16:15.680\n Because when you pick up one which gives minimum,\n\n1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:21.660\n you can pick up one function which does not converge\n\n1:16:21.660 --> 1:16:26.660\n and it will give you the best answer for this function.\n\n1:16:31.460 --> 1:16:34.900\n So you need uniform convergence to guarantee learning.\n\n1:16:34.900 --> 1:16:39.900\n So learning does not rely on trivial law of large numbers,\n\n1:16:40.220 --> 1:16:42.940\n it relies on universal law.\n\n1:16:42.940 --> 1:16:51.940\n But idea of convergence exists in statistics for a long time.\n\n1:16:51.940 --> 1:16:56.940\n But it is interesting that as I think about myself,\n\n1:17:02.140 --> 1:17:07.140\n how stupid I was 50 years, I did not see weak convergence.\n\n1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:10.940\n I work on strong convergence.\n\n1:17:10.940 --> 1:17:15.260\n But now I think that most powerful is weak convergence.\n\n1:17:15.260 --> 1:17:18.860\n Because it makes admissible set of functions.\n\n1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:22.720\n And even in all proverbs,\n\n1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:27.720\n when people try to understand recognition about dog law,\n\n1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:32.400\n looks like a dog and so on, they use weak convergence.\n\n1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.600\n People in language, they understand this.\n\n1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:39.600\n But when we're trying to create artificial intelligence,\n\n1:17:42.260 --> 1:17:45.060\n we want event in different way.\n\n1:17:46.220 --> 1:17:50.540\n We just consider strong convergence arguments.\n\n1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:52.740\n So reducing the set of admissible functions,\n\n1:17:52.740 --> 1:17:57.740\n you think there should be effort put into understanding\n\n1:17:58.780 --> 1:18:01.260\n the properties of weak convergence?\n\n1:18:01.260 --> 1:18:06.260\n You know, in classical mathematics, in Gilbert space,\n\n1:18:07.260 --> 1:18:08.820\n there are only two ways,\n\n1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:12.120\n two form of convergence, strong and weak.\n\n1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:15.760\n Now we can use both.\n\n1:18:16.900 --> 1:18:19.700\n That means that we did everything.\n\n1:18:21.180 --> 1:18:26.180\n And it so happened that when we use Hilbert space,\n\n1:18:26.180 --> 1:18:31.180\n which is very rich space, space of continuous functions,\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:36.860\n which has integral and square.\n\n1:18:38.020 --> 1:18:42.420\n So we can apply weak and strong convergence for learning\n\n1:18:42.420 --> 1:18:44.220\n and have closed form solution.\n\n1:18:45.140 --> 1:18:47.660\n So for computationally simple.\n\n1:18:47.660 --> 1:18:51.080\n For me, it is sign that it is right way.\n\n1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:55.740\n Because you don't need any heuristic here,\n\n1:18:55.740 --> 1:18:57.740\n just do whatever you want.\n\n1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:03.380\n But now the only what left is this concept\n\n1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:08.020\n of what is predicate, but it is not statistics.\n\n1:19:08.020 --> 1:19:11.660\n By the way, I like the fact that you think that heuristics\n\n1:19:11.660 --> 1:19:14.900\n are a mess that should be removed from the system.\n\n1:19:14.900 --> 1:19:18.460\n So closed form solution is the ultimate goal.\n\n1:19:18.460 --> 1:19:23.460\n No, it so happened that when you're using right instrument,\n\n1:19:23.980 --> 1:19:25.460\n you have closed form solution.\n\n1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:32.780\n Do you think intelligence, human level intelligence,\n\n1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:34.320\n when we create it,\n\n1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:41.400\n will have something like a closed form solution?\n\n1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:46.380\n You know, now I'm looking on bounds,\n\n1:19:46.380 --> 1:19:49.560\n which I gave bounds for convergence.\n\n1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:53.900\n And when I'm looking for bounds,\n\n1:19:53.900 --> 1:19:58.900\n I'm thinking what is the most appropriate kernel\n\n1:19:59.620 --> 1:20:01.000\n for this bound would be.\n\n1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:04.380\n So we know that in say,\n\n1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:09.720\n all our businesses, we use radial basis function.\n\n1:20:11.460 --> 1:20:13.220\n But looking on the bound,\n\n1:20:13.220 --> 1:20:17.140\n I think that I start to understand that maybe\n\n1:20:17.140 --> 1:20:21.140\n we need to make corrections to radial basis function\n\n1:20:21.140 --> 1:20:26.140\n to be closer to work better for this bounds.\n\n1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:32.540\n So I'm again trying to understand what type of kernel\n\n1:20:33.940 --> 1:20:37.580\n have best approximation,\n\n1:20:37.580 --> 1:20:43.420\n best fit to this bound.\n\n1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:45.580\n Sure, so there's a lot of interesting work\n\n1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:47.780\n that could be done in discovering better functions\n\n1:20:47.780 --> 1:20:51.740\n than radial basis functions for bounds you find.\n\n1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:55.860\n It still comes from,\n\n1:20:55.860 --> 1:21:00.220\n you're looking to mass and trying to understand what.\n\n1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:03.540\n From your own mind, looking at the, I don't know.\n\n1:21:03.540 --> 1:21:08.540\n Then I'm trying to understand what will be good for that.\n\n1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:14.020\n Yeah, but to me, there's still a beauty.\n\n1:21:14.020 --> 1:21:17.980\n Again, maybe I'm a descendant of Alan Turing to heuristics.\n\n1:21:17.980 --> 1:21:22.340\n To me, ultimately, intelligence will be a mess of heuristics.\n\n1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:26.300\n And that's the engineering answer, I guess.\n\n1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:27.460\n Absolutely.\n\n1:21:27.460 --> 1:21:31.060\n When you're doing say, self driving cars,\n\n1:21:31.060 --> 1:21:35.020\n the great guy who will do this.\n\n1:21:35.020 --> 1:21:38.640\n It doesn't matter what theory behind that.\n\n1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:43.800\n Who has a better feeling how to apply it.\n\n1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:48.800\n But by the way, it is the same story about predicates.\n\n1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:53.880\n Because you cannot create rule for,\n\n1:21:53.880 --> 1:21:56.660\n situation is much more than you have rule for that.\n\n1:21:56.660 --> 1:22:01.660\n But maybe you can have more abstract rule\n\n1:22:04.780 --> 1:22:07.740\n than it will be less literal.\n\n1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:10.820\n It is the same story about ideas\n\n1:22:10.820 --> 1:22:15.140\n and ideas applied to specific cases.\n\n1:22:16.500 --> 1:22:17.340\n But still you should reach.\n\n1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:18.900\n You cannot avoid this.\n\n1:22:18.900 --> 1:22:19.740\n Yes, of course.\n\n1:22:19.740 --> 1:22:21.620\n But you should still reach for the ideas\n\n1:22:21.620 --> 1:22:22.940\n to understand the science.\n\n1:22:22.940 --> 1:22:27.940\n Okay, let me kind of ask, do you think neural networks\n\n1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:32.620\n or functions can be made to reason?\n\n1:22:34.100 --> 1:22:37.100\n So what do you think, we've been talking about intelligence,\n\n1:22:37.100 --> 1:22:39.620\n but this idea of reasoning,\n\n1:22:39.620 --> 1:22:44.500\n there's an element of sequentially disassembling,\n\n1:22:44.500 --> 1:22:48.380\n interpreting the images.\n\n1:22:48.380 --> 1:22:53.380\n So when you think of handwritten recognition, we kind of think\n\n1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:56.940\n that there'll be a single, there's an input and output.\n\n1:22:56.940 --> 1:22:58.660\n There's not a recurrence.\n\n1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:04.440\n What do you think about sort of the idea of recurrence,\n\n1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:06.860\n of going back to memory and thinking through this\n\n1:23:06.860 --> 1:23:11.860\n sort of sequentially mangling the different representations\n\n1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:16.860\n over and over until you arrive at a conclusion?\n\n1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:23.460\n Or is ultimately all that can be wrapped up into a function?\n\n1:23:23.460 --> 1:23:28.460\n No, you're suggesting that let us use this type of algorithm.\n\n1:23:29.860 --> 1:23:33.300\n When I started thinking, I first of all,\n\n1:23:33.300 --> 1:23:35.200\n starting to understand what I want.\n\n1:23:36.580 --> 1:23:39.560\n Can I write down what I want?\n\n1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:43.980\n And then I'm trying to formalize.\n\n1:23:45.020 --> 1:23:49.260\n And when I do that, I think I have to solve this problem.\n\n1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:57.120\n And till now I did not see a situation where you need recurrence.\n\n1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:07.840\n But do you observe human beings?\n\n1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:08.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:08.680 --> 1:24:12.400\n You try to, it's the imitation question, right?\n\n1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:14.880\n It seems that human beings reason\n\n1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:19.600\n this kind of sequentially sort of,\n\n1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:24.120\n does that inspire in you a thought that we need to add that\n\n1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:29.020\n into our intelligence systems?\n\n1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:34.440\n You're saying, okay, I mean, you've kind of answered saying\n\n1:24:34.440 --> 1:24:37.040\n until now I haven't seen a need for it.\n\n1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:40.080\n And so because of that, you don't see a reason\n\n1:24:40.080 --> 1:24:41.740\n to think about it.\n\n1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:45.000\n You know, most of things I don't understand.\n\n1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:50.800\n In reasoning in human, it is for me too complicated.\n\n1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:57.740\n For me, the most difficult part is to ask questions,\n\n1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:03.900\n to good questions, how it works,\n\n1:25:03.900 --> 1:25:08.900\n how people asking questions, I don't know this.\n\n1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:13.640\n You said that machine learning is not only\n\n1:25:13.640 --> 1:25:16.480\n about technical things, speaking of questions,\n\n1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:18.220\n but it's also about philosophy.\n\n1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:23.480\n So what role does philosophy play in machine learning?\n\n1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:26.880\n We talked about Plato, but generally thinking\n\n1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:32.480\n in this philosophical way, does it have,\n\n1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:35.240\n how does philosophy and math fit together in your mind?\n\n1:25:36.640 --> 1:25:39.520\n First ideas and then their implementation.\n\n1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:44.520\n It's like predicate, like say admissible set of functions.\n\n1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:51.500\n It comes together, everything.\n\n1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:56.500\n Because the first iteration of theory was done 50 years ago.\n\n1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:00.380\n I told that, this is theory.\n\n1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:04.080\n So everything's there, if you have data you can,\n\n1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:09.080\n and your set of function has not big capacity.\n\n1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:15.760\n So low VC dimension, you can do that.\n\n1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.700\n You can make structural risk minimization, control capacity.\n\n1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:26.140\n But you was not able to make admissible set of function good.\n\n1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:31.140\n Now when suddenly realize that we did not use\n\n1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:37.240\n another idea of convergence, which we can,\n\n1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.480\n everything comes together.\n\n1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:43.320\n But those are mathematical notions.\n\n1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:48.000\n Philosophy plays a role of simply saying\n\n1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:52.080\n that we should be swimming in the space of ideas.\n\n1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:54.320\n Let's talk what is philosophy.\n\n1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:56.920\n Philosophy means understanding of life.\n\n1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:03.080\n So understanding of life, say people like Plata,\n\n1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:07.640\n they understand on very high abstract level of life.\n\n1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:12.040\n So, and whatever I doing,\n\n1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:15.720\n just implementation of my understanding of life.\n\n1:27:16.740 --> 1:27:21.400\n But every new step, it is very difficult.\n\n1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:26.400\n For example, to find this idea\n\n1:27:28.880 --> 1:27:33.880\n that we need big convergence was not simple for me.\n\n1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:43.080\n So that required thinking about life a little bit.\n\n1:27:44.260 --> 1:27:48.840\n Hard to trace, but there was some thought process.\n\n1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:52.960\n I'm working, I'm thinking about the same problem\n\n1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:57.960\n for 50 years or more, and again, and again, and again.\n\n1:28:00.020 --> 1:28:02.680\n I'm trying to be honest and that is very important.\n\n1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:06.320\n Not to be very enthusiastic, but concentrate\n\n1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:10.320\n on whatever we was not able to achieve, for example.\n\n1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:13.360\n And understand why.\n\n1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:18.360\n And now I understand that because I believe in math,\n\n1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:23.740\n I believe that in Wigner's idea.\n\n1:28:23.740 --> 1:28:28.720\n But now when I see that there are only two way\n\n1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:32.060\n of convergence and we're using both,\n\n1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:37.960\n that means that we must do as well as people doing.\n\n1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:42.880\n But now, exactly in philosophy\n\n1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:45.760\n and what we know about predicate,\n\n1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:50.120\n how we understand life, can we describe as a predicate.\n\n1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:56.400\n I thought about that and that is more or less obvious\n\n1:28:57.840 --> 1:28:59.040\n level of symmetry.\n\n1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:05.100\n But next, I have a feeling,\n\n1:29:05.100 --> 1:29:08.060\n it's something about structures.\n\n1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:11.820\n But I don't know how to formulate,\n\n1:29:11.820 --> 1:29:16.180\n how to measure measure of structure and all this stuff.\n\n1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:21.180\n And the guy who will solve this challenge problem,\n\n1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:25.360\n then when we were looking how he did it,\n\n1:29:27.060 --> 1:29:30.340\n probably just only symmetry is not enough.\n\n1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:33.980\n But something like symmetry will be there.\n\n1:29:33.980 --> 1:29:34.820\n Structure will be there.\n\n1:29:34.820 --> 1:29:35.640\n Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:39.300\n Symmetry will be there and level of symmetry will be there.\n\n1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:44.740\n And level of symmetry, antisymmetry, diagonal, vertical.\n\n1:29:44.740 --> 1:29:48.780\n And I even don't know how you can use\n\n1:29:48.780 --> 1:29:52.300\n in different direction idea of symmetry, it's very general.\n\n1:29:52.300 --> 1:29:53.460\n But it will be there.\n\n1:29:54.940 --> 1:29:58.600\n I think that people very sensitive to idea of symmetry.\n\n1:29:58.600 --> 1:30:02.920\n But there are several ideas like symmetry.\n\n1:30:04.900 --> 1:30:07.020\n As I would like to learn.\n\n1:30:07.020 --> 1:30:11.820\n But you cannot learn just thinking about that.\n\n1:30:11.820 --> 1:30:14.100\n You should do challenging problems\n\n1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:19.100\n and then analyze them, why it was able to solve them.\n\n1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:21.380\n And then you will see.\n\n1:30:22.740 --> 1:30:25.420\n Very simple things, it's not easy to find.\n\n1:30:25.420 --> 1:30:30.420\n But even with talking about this every time.\n\n1:30:32.900 --> 1:30:36.340\n I was surprised, I tried to understand.\n\n1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:39.100\n These people describe in language\n\n1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:43.300\n strong convergence mechanism for learning.\n\n1:30:44.460 --> 1:30:46.660\n I did not see, I don't know.\n\n1:30:46.660 --> 1:30:50.100\n But weak convergence, this dark story\n\n1:30:50.100 --> 1:30:54.700\n and story like that when you will explain to kid,\n\n1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.620\n you will use weak convergence argument.\n\n1:30:57.620 --> 1:30:59.780\n It looks like it does like it does that.\n\n1:31:00.900 --> 1:31:05.820\n But when you try to formalize, you're just ignoring this.\n\n1:31:05.820 --> 1:31:10.140\n Why, why 50 years from start of machine learning?\n\n1:31:10.140 --> 1:31:12.420\n And that's the role of philosophy, thinking about life.\n\n1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:16.020\n I think that maybe, I don't know.\n\n1:31:18.300 --> 1:31:22.780\n Maybe this is theory also, we should blame for that\n\n1:31:22.780 --> 1:31:27.100\n because empirical risk minimization and all this stuff.\n\n1:31:27.100 --> 1:31:30.660\n And if you read now textbooks,\n\n1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:34.420\n they just about bound about empirical risk minimization.\n\n1:31:34.420 --> 1:31:39.420\n They don't looking for another problem like admissible set.\n\n1:31:41.820 --> 1:31:46.820\n But on the topic of life, perhaps we,\n\n1:31:47.340 --> 1:31:50.020\n you could talk in Russian for a little bit.\n\n1:31:50.020 --> 1:31:53.180\n What's your favorite memory from childhood?\n\n1:31:53.180 --> 1:31:56.740\n What's your favorite memory from childhood?\n\n1:31:56.740 --> 1:31:57.740\n Oh, music.\n\n1:31:59.500 --> 1:32:02.700\n How about, can you try to answer in Russian?\n\n1:32:02.700 --> 1:32:03.540\n Music?\n\n1:32:04.980 --> 1:32:06.980\n It was very cool when...\n\n1:32:08.100 --> 1:32:09.980\n What kind of music?\n\n1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:11.860\n Classic music.\n\n1:32:11.860 --> 1:32:13.340\n What's your favorite?\n\n1:32:13.340 --> 1:32:15.900\n Well, different composers.\n\n1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:20.900\n At first, it was Vivaldi, I was surprised that it was possible.\n\n1:32:23.500 --> 1:32:28.500\n And then when I understood Bach, I was absolutely shocked.\n\n1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:34.020\n By the way, from him I think that there is a predicate,\n\n1:32:35.180 --> 1:32:36.740\n like a structure.\n\n1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:37.580\n In Bach?\n\n1:32:37.580 --> 1:32:38.420\n Well, of course.\n\n1:32:38.420 --> 1:32:42.700\n Because you can just feel the structure.\n\n1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:47.700\n And I don't think that different elements of life\n\n1:32:49.020 --> 1:32:53.020\n are very much divided, in the sense of predicates.\n\n1:32:53.020 --> 1:32:56.900\n Everywhere structure, in painting structure,\n\n1:32:56.900 --> 1:32:59.820\n in human relations structure.\n\n1:32:59.820 --> 1:33:04.820\n Here's how to find these high level predicates, it's...\n\n1:33:05.540 --> 1:33:08.460\n In Bach and in life, everything is connected.\n\n1:33:08.460 --> 1:33:13.460\n Now that we're talking about Bach,\n\n1:33:14.100 --> 1:33:15.700\n let's switch back to English,\n\n1:33:15.700 --> 1:33:18.580\n because I like Beethoven and Chopin, so...\n\n1:33:18.580 --> 1:33:21.300\n Well, Chopin, it's another amusing story.\n\n1:33:21.300 --> 1:33:23.940\n But Bach, if we talk about predicates,\n\n1:33:23.940 --> 1:33:28.940\n Bach probably has the most sort of\n\n1:33:29.300 --> 1:33:31.860\n well defined predicates that underlie it.\n\n1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:36.860\n It is very interesting to read what critics\n\n1:33:36.860 --> 1:33:40.460\n are writing about Bach, which words they're using.\n\n1:33:40.460 --> 1:33:43.500\n They're trying to describe predicates.\n\n1:33:43.500 --> 1:33:48.500\n And then Chopin, it is very different vocabulary,\n\n1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:55.140\n very different predicates.\n\n1:33:55.140 --> 1:34:00.140\n And I think that if you will make collection of that,\n\n1:34:02.700 --> 1:34:05.860\n so maybe from this you can describe predicate\n\n1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:07.660\n for digit recognition as well.\n\n1:34:08.780 --> 1:34:10.460\n From Bach and Chopin.\n\n1:34:10.460 --> 1:34:12.540\n No, no, no, not from Bach and Chopin.\n\n1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:15.260\n From the critic interpretation of the music, yeah.\n\n1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:20.260\n When they're trying to explain you music, what they use.\n\n1:34:22.300 --> 1:34:25.260\n As they use, they describe high level ideas\n\n1:34:25.260 --> 1:34:28.900\n of platos ideas, what behind this music.\n\n1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:29.740\n That's brilliant.\n\n1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:34.740\n So art is not self explanatory in some sense.\n\n1:34:34.740 --> 1:34:39.060\n So you have to try to convert it into ideas.\n\n1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:40.940\n It is ill post problems.\n\n1:34:40.940 --> 1:34:45.940\n When you go from ideas to the representation,\n\n1:34:46.060 --> 1:34:47.580\n it is easy way.\n\n1:34:47.580 --> 1:34:51.420\n But when you're trying to go Bach, it is ill post problems.\n\n1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:55.660\n But nevertheless, I believe that when you're looking\n\n1:34:55.660 --> 1:35:00.340\n from that, even from art, you will be able to find\n\n1:35:00.340 --> 1:35:02.100\n predicates for digit recognition.\n\n1:35:02.100 --> 1:35:07.100\n That's such a fascinating and powerful notion.\n\n1:35:08.500 --> 1:35:10.600\n Do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:12.540\n Do you think about it?\n\n1:35:12.540 --> 1:35:13.660\n Do you fear it?\n\n1:35:13.660 --> 1:35:15.100\n Do you draw insight from it?\n\n1:35:16.820 --> 1:35:20.460\n About mortality, no, yeah.\n\n1:35:21.540 --> 1:35:22.820\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n1:35:25.860 --> 1:35:29.660\n Not too much, not too much.\n\n1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:33.700\n It is pity that I will not be able to do something\n\n1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:38.700\n which I think I have a feeling to do that.\n\n1:35:39.460 --> 1:35:44.460\n For example, I will be very happy to work with guys\n\n1:35:48.020 --> 1:35:52.060\n theoretician from music to write this collection\n\n1:35:52.060 --> 1:35:55.060\n of description, how they describe music,\n\n1:35:55.060 --> 1:36:00.060\n how they use that predicate, and from art as well.\n\n1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:04.580\n Then take what is in common and try to understand\n\n1:36:04.580 --> 1:36:08.660\n predicate which is absolute for everything.\n\n1:36:08.660 --> 1:36:10.460\n And then use that for visual recognition\n\n1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:12.180\n and see if there is a connection.\n\n1:36:12.180 --> 1:36:13.540\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:36:13.540 --> 1:36:14.660\n Ah, there's still time.\n\n1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:15.580\n We got time.\n\n1:36:16.980 --> 1:36:18.660\n Ha ha ha ha.\n\n1:36:18.660 --> 1:36:19.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:20.340\n We got time.\n\n1:36:20.340 --> 1:36:24.100\n It take years and years and years.\n\n1:36:24.100 --> 1:36:26.460\n Yes, yeah, it's a long way.\n\n1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:30.900\n Well, see, you've got the patient mathematicians mind.\n\n1:36:30.900 --> 1:36:34.060\n I think it could be done very quickly and very beautifully.\n\n1:36:34.060 --> 1:36:35.820\n I think it's a really elegant idea.\n\n1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:36.940\n Yeah, but also.\n\n1:36:36.940 --> 1:36:37.780\n Some of many.\n\n1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:40.580\n Yeah, you know, the most time,\n\n1:36:40.580 --> 1:36:45.280\n it is not to make this collection to understand\n\n1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:48.700\n what is the common to think about that once again\n\n1:36:48.700 --> 1:36:49.540\n and again and again.\n\n1:36:49.540 --> 1:36:52.660\n Again and again and again, but I think sometimes,\n\n1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:55.700\n especially just when you say this idea now,\n\n1:36:55.700 --> 1:36:58.780\n even just putting together the collection\n\n1:36:58.780 --> 1:37:03.300\n and looking at the different sets of data,\n\n1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:05.520\n language, trying to interpret music,\n\n1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:08.740\n criticize music, and images,\n\n1:37:08.740 --> 1:37:10.940\n I think there'll be sparks of ideas that'll come.\n\n1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:13.420\n Of course, again and again, you'll come up with better ideas,\n\n1:37:13.420 --> 1:37:16.940\n but even just that notion is a beautiful notion.\n\n1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:19.340\n I even have some example.\n\n1:37:19.340 --> 1:37:23.000\n Yes, so I have friend\n\n1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:29.880\n who was specialist in Russian poetry.\n\n1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:35.320\n She is professor of Russian poetry.\n\n1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:39.400\n He did not write poems,\n\n1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:43.340\n but she know a lot of stuff.\n\n1:37:43.340 --> 1:37:48.080\n She make book, several books,\n\n1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:53.080\n and one of them is a collection of Russian poetry.\n\n1:37:54.680 --> 1:37:57.140\n She have images of Russian poetry.\n\n1:37:57.140 --> 1:37:59.400\n She collect all images of Russian poetry.\n\n1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:03.500\n And I ask her to do following.\n\n1:38:05.420 --> 1:38:08.540\n You have NIPS, digit recognition,\n\n1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:13.520\n and we get 100 digits,\n\n1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:15.280\n or maybe less than 100.\n\n1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:18.920\n I don't remember, maybe 50 digits.\n\n1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:21.680\n And try from poetical point of view,\n\n1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:25.260\n describe every image which she see,\n\n1:38:25.260 --> 1:38:30.260\n using only words of images of Russian poetry.\n\n1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:32.220\n And she did it.\n\n1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:37.560\n And then we tried to,\n\n1:38:41.140 --> 1:38:43.600\n I call it learning using privileged information.\n\n1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:45.920\n I call it privileged information.\n\n1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:48.040\n You have on two languages.\n\n1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:53.040\n One language is just image of digit,\n\n1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:56.620\n and another language, poetic description of this image.\n\n1:38:57.760 --> 1:39:00.080\n And this is privileged information.\n\n1:39:02.360 --> 1:39:04.520\n And there is an algorithm when you're working\n\n1:39:04.520 --> 1:39:08.320\n using privileged information, you're doing better.\n\n1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:10.400\n Much better, so.\n\n1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:11.560\n So there's something there.\n\n1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:12.880\n Something there.\n\n1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:16.000\n And there is a, in NEC,\n\n1:39:16.980 --> 1:39:19.000\n she unfortunately died.\n\n1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:24.840\n The collection of digits\n\n1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:27.240\n in poetic descriptions of these digits.\n\n1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:30.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.920\n So there's something there in that poetic description.\n\n1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:37.920\n But I think that there is a abstract ideas\n\n1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:40.680\n on the plot of level of ideas.\n\n1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:42.000\n Yeah, that they're there.\n\n1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.120\n That could be discovered.\n\n1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:45.000\n And music seems to be a good entry point.\n\n1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:50.000\n But as soon as we start with this challenge problem.\n\n1:39:50.340 --> 1:39:51.180\n The challenge problem.\n\n1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:52.020\n Listen.\n\n1:39:52.020 --> 1:39:55.400\n It immediately connected to all this stuff.\n\n1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:58.060\n Especially with your talk and this podcast,\n\n1:39:58.060 --> 1:40:00.120\n and I'll do whatever I can to advertise it.\n\n1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:03.280\n It's such a clean, beautiful Einstein like formulation\n\n1:40:03.280 --> 1:40:05.240\n of the challenge before us.\n\n1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:06.060\n Right.\n\n1:40:06.060 --> 1:40:09.520\n Let me ask another absurd question.\n\n1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:12.800\n We talked about mortality.\n\n1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:14.640\n We talked about philosophy of life.\n\n1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:16.680\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:22.560\n What's the predicate for mysterious existence here on earth?\n\n1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:30.460\n I don't know.\n\n1:40:33.620 --> 1:40:37.640\n It's very interesting how we have,\n\n1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:42.100\n in Russia, I don't know if you know the guy Strugatsky.\n\n1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:46.320\n They are writing fiction.\n\n1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:49.740\n They're thinking about human, what's going on.\n\n1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:56.680\n And they have idea that there are developing\n\n1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:05.120\n two type of people, common people and very smart people.\n\n1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:06.080\n They just started.\n\n1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:10.420\n And these two branches of people will go\n\n1:41:10.420 --> 1:41:12.180\n in different direction very soon.\n\n1:41:13.540 --> 1:41:16.220\n So that's what they're thinking about that.\n\n1:41:18.980 --> 1:41:23.800\n So the purpose of life is to create two paths.\n\n1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:24.640\n Two paths.\n\n1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:25.940\n Of human societies.\n\n1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:27.020\n Yes.\n\n1:41:27.020 --> 1:41:29.980\n Simple people and more complicated people.\n\n1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:31.540\n Which do you like best?\n\n1:41:31.540 --> 1:41:34.500\n The simple people or the complicated ones?\n\n1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:38.260\n I don't know that it is just his fantasy,\n\n1:41:38.260 --> 1:41:41.700\n but you know, every week we have guy\n\n1:41:41.700 --> 1:41:46.700\n who is just a writer and also a theorist of literature.\n\n1:41:51.820 --> 1:41:56.600\n And he explain how he understand literature\n\n1:41:56.600 --> 1:41:58.800\n and human relationship.\n\n1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:00.340\n How he see life.\n\n1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:05.340\n And I understood that I'm just small kids\n\n1:42:06.920 --> 1:42:08.100\n comparing to him.\n\n1:42:09.500 --> 1:42:12.640\n He's very smart guy in understanding life.\n\n1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:15.640\n He knows this predicate.\n\n1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:19.760\n He knows big blocks of life.\n\n1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:23.300\n I am used every time when I listen to him.\n\n1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:27.400\n And he just talking about literature.\n\n1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:31.400\n And I think that I was surprised.\n\n1:42:33.200 --> 1:42:38.200\n So the managers in big companies,\n\n1:42:41.460 --> 1:42:46.460\n most of them are guys who study English language\n\n1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:50.060\n and English literature.\n\n1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:52.520\n So why?\n\n1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:54.820\n Because they understand life.\n\n1:42:54.820 --> 1:42:57.040\n They understand models.\n\n1:42:57.040 --> 1:42:58.800\n And among them,\n\n1:42:58.800 --> 1:43:03.800\n maybe many talented critics just analyzing this.\n\n1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:10.520\n And this is big science like property.\n\n1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.380\n This is blocks.\n\n1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:15.340\n That's very smart.\n\n1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:21.520\n It amazes me that you are and continue to be humbled\n\n1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:22.960\n by the brilliance of others.\n\n1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:25.540\n I'm very modest about myself.\n\n1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:28.960\n I see so smart guys around.\n\n1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:31.720\n Well, let me be immodest for you.\n\n1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:33.920\n You're one of the greatest mathematicians,\n\n1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:35.820\n statisticians of our time.\n\n1:43:35.820 --> 1:43:36.960\n It's truly an honor.\n\n1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:38.600\n Thank you for talking again.\n\n1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:39.520\n And let's talk.\n\n1:43:41.240 --> 1:43:42.080\n It is not.\n\n1:43:43.440 --> 1:43:44.580\n I know my limits.\n\n1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:49.120\n Let's talk again
