instead of plastic\n\n00:05.800 --> 00:07.600\n on the front face of the iPhone.\n\n00:07.600 --> 00:10.000\n And we're going to do this.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:14.000\n And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.\n\n00:14.000 --> 00:17.000\n And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details,\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:19.480\n but he could see in our minds that we're like,\n\n00:19.480 --> 00:22.040\n yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,\n\n00:22.040 --> 00:24.080\n but man, it's really putting us in risk.\n\n00:24.080 --> 00:26.040\n And we laid out the risks for him.\n\n00:26.040 --> 00:28.280\n And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.\n\n00:28.280 --> 00:31.200\n The following is a conversation with Tony Fadell,\n\n00:31.200 --> 00:34.920\n engineer and designer, co creator of the iPod,\n\n00:34.920 --> 00:38.400\n the iPhone and the Nest Thermostat.\n\n00:38.400 --> 00:41.080\n And he's the author of the new book, Build,\n\n00:41.080 --> 00:45.200\n an unorthodox guide to making things worth making.\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:48.080\n More than almost any human ever,\n\n00:48.080 --> 00:50.880\n he knows what it takes to create technology ideas,\n\n00:50.880 --> 00:55.160\n designs, products and companies that revolutionize life\n\n00:55.160 --> 00:58.360\n for huge numbers of people in the world.\n\n00:58.360 --> 01:01.120\n So it truly is an honor and pleasure\n\n01:01.120 --> 01:02.960\n to sit down with Tony for a time\n\n01:02.960 --> 01:05.720\n and look back at one heck of an amazing life.\n\n01:06.640 --> 01:08.720\n This is the Lex Readman podcast.\n\n01:08.720 --> 01:10.960\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:10.960 --> 01:12.200\n in the description.\n\n01:12.200 --> 01:16.200\n And now, dear friends, here's Tony Fadell.\n\n01:17.320 --> 01:20.480\n When did you first fall in love with computers?\n\n01:20.480 --> 01:22.800\n Or let's say computer engineering and design?\n\n01:22.800 --> 01:27.800\n I first fell in love with computers and programming.\n\n01:28.880 --> 01:33.880\n Was it a summer school class in fifth grade\n\n01:33.880 --> 01:36.000\n in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan?\n\n01:37.520 --> 01:39.960\n It was a simple basic programming class,\n\n01:39.960 --> 01:41.520\n but the basic programming class\n\n01:41.520 --> 01:44.080\n was not like you might think it was.\n\n01:44.080 --> 01:45.480\n It was bubble cards.\n\n01:45.480 --> 01:50.280\n So literally it was the cards, the stack of cards,\n\n01:50.280 --> 01:53.840\n and you would use a number two pencil and you would put in\n\n01:53.840 --> 01:55.320\n your program line by line,\n\n01:55.320 --> 01:57.280\n and you'd have to make sure it was perfectly stacked\n\n01:57.280 --> 01:58.760\n and no errors and what have you.\n\n01:58.760 --> 02:00.320\n And you would take that set of cards\n\n02:00.320 --> 02:03.280\n and you'd put it on this reader and it would zzzt, zzzt, zzzt.\n\n02:03.280 --> 02:06.080\n And it would go off to an IBM microcomputer\n\n02:06.080 --> 02:09.080\n somewhere in the, back then the cloud.\n\n02:09.080 --> 02:14.080\n And then you would sit on a Texas Instruments paper terminal.\n\n02:16.800 --> 02:19.200\n And it would just, literally I was just,\n\n02:19.200 --> 02:21.160\n I could write things and it would,\n\n02:21.160 --> 02:23.000\n I could program this machine to do stuff.\n\n02:23.000 --> 02:25.200\n And it was, you know, it was nowhere near sexy.\n\n02:25.200 --> 02:26.880\n There was no graphics, right?\n\n02:26.880 --> 02:30.440\n Oregon Trail was all in text, right?\n\n02:30.440 --> 02:33.360\n The cards were so cumbersome that if you got one thing wrong\n\n02:33.360 --> 02:37.240\n or out of order, or a disaster, or you dropped one card,\n\n02:37.240 --> 02:38.800\n it would all fall apart.\n\n02:38.800 --> 02:42.520\n So just doing that, you know, print f,\n\n02:42.520 --> 02:43.360\n or what was it?\n\n02:43.360 --> 02:44.760\n I can only remember what it was.\n\n02:44.760 --> 02:48.240\n It was, you know, what the basic commands were, but.\n\n02:48.240 --> 02:50.680\n Oh, so when you say basic, you mean basic programming?\n\n02:50.680 --> 02:51.680\n Programming language.\n\n02:51.680 --> 02:52.520\n Okay.\n\n02:52.520 --> 02:53.360\n Basic programming.\n\n02:53.360 --> 02:57.440\n So you're writing basic programming language on paper.\n\n02:57.440 --> 02:58.520\n On paper.\n\n02:58.520 --> 03:00.040\n And you're calling it programming though.\n\n03:00.040 --> 03:01.160\n It's called programming.\n\n03:01.160 --> 03:03.600\n Yeah, you're programming this computer in, you know,\n\n03:03.600 --> 03:06.200\n in a remote location and it came back.\n\n03:06.200 --> 03:08.640\n So it was truly cloud computing in a way.\n\n03:08.640 --> 03:11.280\n So it was really terminal based computing.\n\n03:11.280 --> 03:14.040\n And the input and the program are separate.\n\n03:14.040 --> 03:17.200\n So the input to the program, or they could go together.\n\n03:17.200 --> 03:20.320\n Like, or there's no input to the program.\n\n03:20.320 --> 03:22.280\n It just runs and it gives you output.\n\n03:22.280 --> 03:24.960\n Yeah, it goes in and it says ready,\n\n03:24.960 --> 03:27.680\n and then you can say run, and then it would run.\n\n03:27.680 --> 03:30.000\n But to program it, you didn't type it\n\n03:30.000 --> 03:31.440\n because it was a printer terminal.\n\n03:31.440 --> 03:32.760\n You would make the stack of cards\n\n03:32.760 --> 03:35.720\n and that would get it into the computer's memory.\n\n03:35.720 --> 03:37.920\n Okay, so where was the magic?\n\n03:37.920 --> 03:41.480\n The magic was that you could create, you had a language\n\n03:41.480 --> 03:43.720\n and you could create what you wanted to create, right?\n\n03:43.720 --> 03:46.040\n You could create a world or what have you\n\n03:46.040 --> 03:47.520\n and have this interaction.\n\n03:47.520 --> 03:50.080\n And you could compute things, you could, you know,\n\n03:50.080 --> 03:53.960\n do numbers, you could, I was playing Oregon Trail, right?\n\n03:53.960 --> 03:54.800\n So you were less like.\n\n03:54.800 --> 03:56.720\n So you can play video games.\n\n03:56.720 --> 03:58.040\n Well, video.\n\n03:58.040 --> 03:59.880\n Right, without the video.\n\n03:59.880 --> 04:01.200\n You could play text games\n\n04:01.200 --> 04:03.400\n and then imagine them in your brain, right?\n\n04:04.520 --> 04:08.080\n Oregon Trail, there's this meme I saw recently.\n\n04:08.080 --> 04:11.760\n If you wanna feel bad about yourself as a programmer,\n\n04:11.760 --> 04:16.400\n realize that one person wrote Railroad Tycoon.\n\n04:16.400 --> 04:17.760\n I think that's the name of the game.\n\n04:17.760 --> 04:20.200\n It's this cool little builder game.\n\n04:20.200 --> 04:22.920\n One person wrote it in assembly.\n\n04:22.920 --> 04:27.920\n So like from scratch and for people who don't know,\n\n04:29.320 --> 04:31.600\n it kind of looks like a Sim City type game.\n\n04:31.600 --> 04:35.080\n It's a city builder, but obviously centered on railroads.\n\n04:35.080 --> 04:36.920\n And there's a nice graphics, it's three dimensional,\n\n04:36.920 --> 04:38.000\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n04:38.000 --> 04:40.960\n All the things, all the rich colorful things\n\n04:40.960 --> 04:43.800\n you would imagine for a three dimensional video game,\n\n04:43.800 --> 04:45.280\n all written in assembly,\n\n04:45.280 --> 04:48.760\n meaning the lowest level code next to binary,\n\n04:48.760 --> 04:50.120\n which is fascinating.\n\n04:50.120 --> 04:53.480\n And that's the, you had to notice the magic\n\n04:53.480 --> 04:55.640\n at that low level at that time.\n\n04:55.640 --> 04:57.120\n You didn't have all the graphics.\n\n04:57.120 --> 05:02.040\n You didn't have all the like APIs and all the sample codes,\n\n05:02.040 --> 05:04.440\n no stack overflow, no internet, none of that.\n\n05:04.440 --> 05:06.360\n You just had, you had to know registers.\n\n05:06.360 --> 05:08.240\n You know, had to know the op codes\n\n05:08.240 --> 05:10.200\n and you had to imagine the world in your brain\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:12.160\n and the memory structures and everything else.\n\n05:12.160 --> 05:13.240\n There's no visualization.\n\n05:13.240 --> 05:15.440\n You visualized it all yourself, right?\n\n05:15.440 --> 05:16.520\n And so that was magic.\n\n05:16.520 --> 05:18.000\n But then the next part of the magic\n\n05:18.000 --> 05:20.360\n of where I got hooked even further\n\n05:20.360 --> 05:22.400\n was like I'm doing these little things.\n\n05:22.400 --> 05:25.520\n And then Electronic Arts came out for the Apple II.\n\n05:25.520 --> 05:28.240\n So I got an Apple II and Electronic Arts came out\n\n05:28.240 --> 05:29.920\n and I was programming and doing basic\n\n05:29.920 --> 05:31.760\n and making my own games.\n\n05:31.760 --> 05:34.400\n But then there were two games that really blew my mind.\n\n05:34.400 --> 05:37.160\n One was pinball construction set.\n\n05:37.160 --> 05:39.600\n And the other one was music construction set.\n\n05:39.600 --> 05:42.800\n And these were both places where I could create pinball games\n\n05:42.800 --> 05:45.040\n and I could create musical scores\n\n05:45.040 --> 05:48.160\n because I love music and I could then play them, right?\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:50.560\n And so when you had that, you were like,\n\n05:50.560 --> 05:53.200\n oh, this is something very different.\n\n05:53.200 --> 05:54.960\n So I could create myself,\n\n05:54.960 --> 05:57.360\n but then there was others that create tools\n\n05:57.360 --> 06:00.040\n so you could create at a visual level.\n\n06:00.040 --> 06:01.560\n And then you would read the backstories\n\n06:01.560 --> 06:03.520\n because Electronics Arts back in the day,\n\n06:03.520 --> 06:06.520\n it was one programmer who would program those games\n\n06:06.520 --> 06:08.760\n program those things, each of those things.\n\n06:08.760 --> 06:10.200\n And you could read their backstories.\n\n06:10.200 --> 06:13.240\n It was literally like a musician or someone else.\n\n06:13.240 --> 06:15.560\n Like you could read Rick Rubens, like here's the thing.\n\n06:15.560 --> 06:16.800\n They tell you all of that stuff.\n\n06:16.800 --> 06:20.800\n And there was one guy who wrote music construction set.\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:24.360\n He wrote it all in assembly and he was 16 years old.\n\n06:24.360 --> 06:25.200\n Wow.\n\n06:25.200 --> 06:28.920\n And I was probably 12 or 13 at the time.\n\n06:28.920 --> 06:33.040\n And I went, oh my, if he was able to do this\n\n06:33.040 --> 06:37.640\n and had published, right, and this amazing tool was created,\n\n06:37.640 --> 06:38.760\n I'm like, what could I do?\n\n06:38.760 --> 06:41.600\n And so then it just kept building off of that.\n\n06:41.600 --> 06:43.520\n But really it was those seminal things.\n\n06:43.520 --> 06:46.240\n First, the introduction and then the power\n\n06:46.240 --> 06:48.480\n through programming and turning these things\n\n06:48.480 --> 06:50.760\n into what you wanted to turn it into.\n\n06:50.760 --> 06:53.960\n And you didn't have to be 40, 50 years old\n\n06:53.960 --> 06:55.480\n and have PhDs.\n\n06:55.480 --> 06:58.680\n And then I was like, okay, this is really cool.\n\n06:58.680 --> 07:01.040\n I wish we did that with programmers\n\n07:01.040 --> 07:02.560\n where we treated them like artists.\n\n07:02.560 --> 07:05.320\n We would know the backstory these days today.\n\n07:05.320 --> 07:07.600\n Or not just programmers, engineers.\n\n07:07.600 --> 07:09.080\n Engineers, designers.\n\n07:09.080 --> 07:11.400\n Yeah, like all the things about a product\n\n07:11.400 --> 07:14.440\n that I think we love are the little details.\n\n07:14.440 --> 07:16.160\n And there's probably a human being\n\n07:16.160 --> 07:18.880\n behind each of those details\n\n07:18.880 --> 07:22.520\n that had their little inkling of genius that they put in.\n\n07:22.520 --> 07:24.080\n I wish we knew those stories.\n\n07:24.080 --> 07:25.760\n That's always sad to me when I,\n\n07:25.760 --> 07:28.160\n because obviously I love engineering\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:29.640\n and I interact with companies\n\n07:29.640 --> 07:31.960\n and they, you know, autonomous vehicles,\n\n07:31.960 --> 07:33.200\n something I'm really interested about.\n\n07:33.200 --> 07:35.840\n And I see that companies generally,\n\n07:35.840 --> 07:37.160\n and we'll probably talk about this,\n\n07:37.160 --> 07:39.560\n but they seem to want to hide their engineers.\n\n07:39.560 --> 07:42.840\n Like engineers hold the secrets.\n\n07:42.840 --> 07:44.720\n Like the great secret,\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:47.160\n we did not speak of the great secret.\n\n07:47.160 --> 07:50.680\n But then the result of that is you don't get\n\n07:50.680 --> 07:52.440\n to hear their stories.\n\n07:52.440 --> 07:56.280\n The passion that is there behind the engineers.\n\n07:56.280 --> 07:59.200\n Like, and also the genius, the little,\n\n07:59.200 --> 08:01.680\n there's a difference between the stuff that's patented,\n\n08:01.680 --> 08:03.800\n like the kernel of the idea\n\n08:03.800 --> 08:06.600\n and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea.\n\n08:06.600 --> 08:09.240\n And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects\n\n08:09.240 --> 08:13.440\n a little bit more, but sorry for the distraction.\n\n08:13.440 --> 08:15.760\n So what, you mentioned Apple II.\n\n08:15.760 --> 08:18.680\n What was the first computer you fell in love with?\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:21.400\n Like the product, the thing before you\n\n08:21.400 --> 08:23.640\n that was a personal computer?\n\n08:23.640 --> 08:25.200\n It was the Apple II.\n\n08:25.200 --> 08:28.960\n So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over.\n\n08:28.960 --> 08:31.440\n You know, it was, I think it was at the time,\n\n08:31.440 --> 08:34.000\n it was the, you know, the person of the year.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:35.120\n Maybe it was that year.\n\n08:35.120 --> 08:36.960\n I don't remember what, but.\n\n08:36.960 --> 08:38.880\n Well, Apple II was the person of the year?\n\n08:38.880 --> 08:41.720\n Yeah, for my magazine back in, I don't remember when,\n\n08:41.720 --> 08:43.000\n but it was around that same time.\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:46.680\n I was so young, but I had, there was the Apple II\n\n08:46.680 --> 08:49.080\n and I didn't know what it was, but I knew about tools\n\n08:49.080 --> 08:50.820\n because my grandfather taught me about tools\n\n08:50.820 --> 08:53.840\n and creating things, right?\n\n08:53.840 --> 08:56.840\n And I saw this thing and I had the, you know,\n\n08:56.840 --> 08:59.260\n that IBM experience, that terminal experience.\n\n08:59.260 --> 09:01.560\n And I'm like, oh, I could have that at home, right?\n\n09:01.560 --> 09:03.080\n And so I need to have that at home.\n\n09:03.080 --> 09:04.880\n And the only thing that was really talked about\n\n09:04.880 --> 09:06.960\n in our circles was the Apple II.\n\n09:06.960 --> 09:08.880\n And I was just like, that's it.\n\n09:08.880 --> 09:11.260\n So I went, jumped up and down.\n\n09:11.260 --> 09:12.600\n It was very expensive.\n\n09:12.600 --> 09:13.440\n I have to have this.\n\n09:13.440 --> 09:14.480\n My parents were like, what?\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:19.240\n You know, it was $2,500 back then in the 1981.\n\n09:19.240 --> 09:20.980\n It was like crazy, right?\n\n09:20.980 --> 09:23.000\n So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:23.920\n as I can this summer.\n\n09:23.920 --> 09:25.240\n And my grandfather said,\n\n09:25.240 --> 09:27.600\n cause he helped me learn all about tools\n\n09:27.600 --> 09:29.120\n and build things together.\n\n09:29.120 --> 09:30.800\n I will match whatever you make\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:32.200\n so you can get this computer.\n\n09:32.200 --> 09:36.620\n So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy.\n\n09:36.620 --> 09:38.640\n Caddying actually for the, you know,\n\n09:38.640 --> 09:41.000\n the families in, you know, at the country clubs\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:43.960\n in the town where we lived.\n\n09:43.960 --> 09:45.440\n And did whatever I could.\n\n09:45.440 --> 09:48.380\n And that end of that summer, we got my Apple II.\n\n09:48.380 --> 09:50.240\n And you couldn't tear it away from me.\n\n09:50.240 --> 09:51.620\n It was my friend.\n\n09:51.620 --> 09:52.720\n It was everything.\n\n09:52.720 --> 09:54.640\n From a product perspective,\n\n09:54.640 --> 09:56.960\n what do you remember that was brilliant?\n\n09:56.960 --> 10:01.120\n The design choices, the ideas behind it,\n\n10:01.120 --> 10:02.760\n or is it just that it exists?\n\n10:02.760 --> 10:05.160\n Or the very idea of a personal computer\n\n10:05.160 --> 10:07.160\n is the brilliant design choice.\n\n10:07.160 --> 10:10.040\n Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool\n\n10:10.040 --> 10:12.940\n in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted.\n\n10:12.940 --> 10:14.300\n I could program it anyways.\n\n10:14.300 --> 10:16.680\n There was no, you know, there was no internet connection.\n\n10:16.680 --> 10:18.820\n There was no, it was all just you.\n\n10:18.820 --> 10:22.660\n You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?\n\n10:22.660 --> 10:24.200\n Or you created it yourself.\n\n10:24.200 --> 10:25.740\n And then there was the whole other thing\n\n10:25.740 --> 10:28.380\n which was started happening, which we were doing.\n\n10:28.380 --> 10:30.340\n And this was kind of like MP3 and stuff.\n\n10:30.340 --> 10:32.200\n We were sharing software, right?\n\n10:32.200 --> 10:34.280\n So you built this community of sharing software.\n\n10:34.280 --> 10:35.720\n You would go and pirate.\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:37.780\n That was what it called, pirate all this software.\n\n10:37.780 --> 10:39.920\n You'd never use it all, but it was just that fun thing\n\n10:39.920 --> 10:41.800\n of like, I'm gonna get all this other stuff\n\n10:41.800 --> 10:44.120\n and then tear it apart and do disassembly on it\n\n10:44.120 --> 10:45.640\n and see behind the scenes.\n\n10:45.640 --> 10:48.560\n So you really had a sense this was your world\n\n10:48.560 --> 10:50.080\n and you owned it, right?\n\n10:50.080 --> 10:52.560\n And you could like literally go into every register.\n\n10:52.560 --> 10:53.920\n We didn't have all those security layers.\n\n10:53.920 --> 10:55.160\n Like we do not like,\n\n10:55.160 --> 10:57.560\n you could really touch bits and you could poke bits\n\n10:57.560 --> 10:59.200\n and you can make this light turn on.\n\n10:59.200 --> 11:01.760\n And the geek assignment just lit up.\n\n11:01.760 --> 11:05.260\n Now there's, it's so abstract.\n\n11:05.260 --> 11:06.380\n People don't even understand.\n\n11:06.380 --> 11:09.100\n Like usually some programs don't even understand memory.\n\n11:09.100 --> 11:11.320\n They just think it's unlimited, right?\n\n11:11.320 --> 11:13.320\n And security, it's like,\n\n11:13.320 --> 11:16.080\n now there's all this security you should have,\n\n11:16.080 --> 11:19.160\n but it's like the adults all showed up to the party\n\n11:19.160 --> 11:21.440\n and now you can't have all the fun, right?\n\n11:21.440 --> 11:23.180\n It's like, no, no.\n\n11:23.180 --> 11:26.400\n This was the thing where if you, if the power went out,\n\n11:26.400 --> 11:27.580\n you lost your whole program,\n\n11:27.580 --> 11:28.960\n you might've worked a whole day on it.\n\n11:28.960 --> 11:31.760\n And if you didn't press save at every other line\n\n11:31.760 --> 11:33.360\n and you were to save, save, save,\n\n11:33.360 --> 11:36.520\n and it would like, the disk drive or the tape drive.\n\n11:38.080 --> 11:41.640\n Like every single step was contemplated\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:45.260\n because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work.\n\n11:45.260 --> 11:47.520\n So a lot of the magic was in the software.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:48.960\n The fact that you could have software,\n\n11:48.960 --> 11:51.000\n the fact that you could share software,\n\n11:51.000 --> 11:53.880\n the community around the software,\n\n11:53.880 --> 11:55.520\n it wasn't necessarily the hardware.\n\n11:55.520 --> 11:56.800\n Well, that was the first step.\n\n11:56.800 --> 11:58.840\n The second step around the hardware\n\n11:58.840 --> 12:01.240\n was I got things like the mocking board,\n\n12:01.240 --> 12:02.680\n which the mocking board\n\n12:02.680 --> 12:04.020\n paired with the music construction set,\n\n12:04.020 --> 12:06.360\n you could now generate all kinds of tones and notes\n\n12:06.360 --> 12:09.120\n and it was a synthesizer in the Apple II.\n\n12:09.120 --> 12:11.040\n So you would plug in this card and you go,\n\n12:11.040 --> 12:12.080\n oh my God, look at this.\n\n12:12.080 --> 12:13.300\n And it would, you know,\n\n12:13.300 --> 12:15.560\n you could start generating cool sounds.\n\n12:15.560 --> 12:17.960\n You know, like it was a Moog, you know,\n\n12:17.960 --> 12:20.320\n like a Moog in a way, early Moog.\n\n12:20.320 --> 12:21.760\n What year are we talking about?\n\n12:21.760 --> 12:25.820\n This is 82, I think, 81, 82.\n\n12:25.820 --> 12:28.520\n And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds\n\n12:28.520 --> 12:30.280\n that are very cool in the 80s.\n\n12:30.280 --> 12:32.660\n Yeah, the 8 bit, you know, chip tunes, right?\n\n12:32.660 --> 12:34.320\n Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.\n\n12:34.320 --> 12:38.000\n And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick,\n\n12:38.000 --> 12:39.160\n you had to pull a chip out\n\n12:39.160 --> 12:41.200\n and you had to like plug in a dip socket\n\n12:41.200 --> 12:42.600\n to put in a joystick.\n\n12:42.600 --> 12:43.760\n And then I was like, oh,\n\n12:43.760 --> 12:44.960\n and then I had to get more memory.\n\n12:44.960 --> 12:45.880\n How do we do that?\n\n12:45.880 --> 12:47.400\n And now I wanted to speed up progress.\n\n12:47.400 --> 12:51.960\n So then that turned into a company actually from that,\n\n12:51.960 --> 12:54.680\n but it was, and a hardware software went at that.\n\n12:54.680 --> 12:55.960\n But it was all about, you know,\n\n12:55.960 --> 12:58.560\n modifying this thing in every way, first with software.\n\n12:58.560 --> 13:00.200\n And then you started gaining confidence.\n\n13:00.200 --> 13:01.920\n And then I got a little bit more money and stuff.\n\n13:01.920 --> 13:03.400\n And then you could get into the hardware\n\n13:03.400 --> 13:05.160\n and, you know, wire things.\n\n13:05.160 --> 13:09.280\n And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:12.560\n So in the back, in the early Apple IIs,\n\n13:12.560 --> 13:14.920\n you could open up and all the schematics were there.\n\n13:14.920 --> 13:18.040\n So you purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it.\n\n13:18.040 --> 13:19.560\n Yeah, it came with it.\n\n13:19.560 --> 13:21.360\n That's an interesting choice.\n\n13:21.360 --> 13:25.040\n That's an interesting choice from a company perspective.\n\n13:25.040 --> 13:27.560\n Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing.\n\n13:27.560 --> 13:28.400\n Right.\n\n13:29.680 --> 13:32.720\n Ah, I wonder what they, so that was intentional.\n\n13:32.720 --> 13:34.160\n Like this is. Absolutely intentional.\n\n13:34.160 --> 13:37.280\n This is for the cutting edge folks too,\n\n13:37.280 --> 13:38.120\n or especially for the cutting edge.\n\n13:38.120 --> 13:39.160\n It was only the cutting edge.\n\n13:39.160 --> 13:41.040\n It was geeks for geeks.\n\n13:41.040 --> 13:41.880\n Yeah.\n\n13:41.880 --> 13:43.120\n So we were like, oh, how did they make it?\n\n13:43.120 --> 13:44.440\n And then we got to learn through that.\n\n13:44.440 --> 13:46.280\n Apple I did the same thing, right?\n\n13:46.280 --> 13:48.600\n It just Apple II became more packaged up\n\n13:48.600 --> 13:52.000\n and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?\n\n13:52.000 --> 13:53.720\n Came with basic and then, you know,\n\n13:53.720 --> 13:57.280\n so it was really, it was what we might think of\n\n13:57.280 --> 14:00.040\n as a raspberry pie today or something like that,\n\n14:00.040 --> 14:01.800\n but not with so much software.\n\n14:01.800 --> 14:03.880\n It was literally, and all the chips were out there\n\n14:03.880 --> 14:06.040\n so you could inspect the buses and the, right?\n\n14:06.040 --> 14:08.280\n Cause everything was just broken out.\n\n14:08.280 --> 14:13.280\n So I guess that's the idea behind stable big projects\n\n14:13.280 --> 14:15.840\n and open source, like on GitHub,\n\n14:15.840 --> 14:18.160\n that you have the schematics there\n\n14:18.160 --> 14:20.480\n and it's kind of a product,\n\n14:20.480 --> 14:23.600\n but I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing.\n\n14:23.600 --> 14:28.600\n Like we're going to release this to a small set of people,\n\n14:29.080 --> 14:33.840\n self selected, perhaps that are kind of the makers,\n\n14:33.840 --> 14:36.480\n the cutting edge folks, the builders,\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:40.400\n the at home engineers, like in some way,\n\n14:40.400 --> 14:45.400\n what Tesla is doing with the beta for the full self driving\n\n14:45.840 --> 14:47.440\n is kind of like that.\n\n14:47.440 --> 14:48.960\n It's like selecting a group of people,\n\n14:48.960 --> 14:51.640\n but that has to do more with you,\n\n14:51.640 --> 14:53.120\n how safe of a driver you are\n\n14:53.120 --> 14:55.400\n versus how much of a tinkerer you are\n\n14:55.400 --> 14:56.840\n because you don't get to tinker.\n\n14:56.840 --> 14:59.960\n I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do\n\n14:59.960 --> 15:01.960\n for really cutting edge technologies,\n\n15:01.960 --> 15:05.460\n especially you're interested in like hardware stuff.\n\n15:05.460 --> 15:06.840\n Is that crazy?\n\n15:06.840 --> 15:10.200\n Why don't more companies do that kind of thing, you think?\n\n15:10.200 --> 15:13.560\n I think back then it was about a community\n\n15:13.560 --> 15:15.760\n and serving that community of builders.\n\n15:15.760 --> 15:18.160\n Now this is about people who want to take,\n\n15:18.160 --> 15:20.720\n get the experience and want it really simple and easy.\n\n15:20.720 --> 15:24.360\n And they're like, and so there's the audience\n\n15:24.360 --> 15:26.160\n or they believe the audience is small\n\n15:26.160 --> 15:27.700\n who would value those other things\n\n15:27.700 --> 15:29.040\n that we're just talking about.\n\n15:29.040 --> 15:30.920\n But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi\n\n15:30.920 --> 15:33.720\n and all of these other little boards, right?\n\n15:33.720 --> 15:36.840\n There's a whole world more than I've seen.\n\n15:36.840 --> 15:38.960\n Like it's amazing what you can do now\n\n15:38.960 --> 15:43.560\n with these little kits and the software that's created.\n\n15:43.560 --> 15:45.160\n And so there's a whole nother,\n\n15:45.160 --> 15:47.520\n I think another batch of makers and builders\n\n15:47.520 --> 15:49.080\n that are coming up through the ranks.\n\n15:49.080 --> 15:51.640\n And if you, we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right?\n\n15:51.640 --> 15:53.240\n They take these little boards, they hack them,\n\n15:53.240 --> 15:56.640\n then they print out parts on their 3D printer,\n\n15:56.640 --> 15:59.480\n assemble them and they create robots and what have you.\n\n15:59.480 --> 16:01.880\n So I think it's happening.\n\n16:01.880 --> 16:03.920\n It's just not as, you know, as,\n\n16:03.920 --> 16:08.920\n it's just not as, I guess, raw as it used to be,\n\n16:09.080 --> 16:11.840\n but it's there and it's really expanding around the world.\n\n16:11.840 --> 16:13.280\n And that's really nice to see\n\n16:13.280 --> 16:15.880\n cause you know, it's a whole new generation\n\n16:15.880 --> 16:17.600\n who can, who are empowered.\n\n16:17.600 --> 16:21.240\n I think there's a semi dormant genius amongst millions.\n\n16:21.240 --> 16:23.560\n So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit.\n\n16:23.560 --> 16:26.080\n It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised\n\n16:26.080 --> 16:28.300\n if it's several million Raspberry Pis\n\n16:28.300 --> 16:30.000\n that have been sold.\n\n16:30.000 --> 16:31.600\n I think more than that.\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:36.360\n And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius,\n\n16:36.360 --> 16:38.400\n brewing of engineers who don't get to hear\n\n16:38.400 --> 16:40.000\n because they're not organized.\n\n16:40.000 --> 16:42.260\n I mean, we get to hear their inklings here and there.\n\n16:42.260 --> 16:44.720\n Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities\n\n16:44.720 --> 16:45.680\n that are local and so on.\n\n16:45.680 --> 16:47.180\n But if they were organized,\n\n16:49.880 --> 16:51.760\n if a leader would emerge, no.\n\n16:51.760 --> 16:55.000\n Okay, so when did you first start to dream\n\n16:55.000 --> 16:58.560\n about building your own things,\n\n16:58.560 --> 17:01.320\n designing your own products,\n\n17:01.320 --> 17:05.120\n designing your own systems and software and hardware?\n\n17:05.120 --> 17:09.080\n Well, in high school, there was a company\n\n17:09.080 --> 17:12.320\n that a friend of mine founded\n\n17:12.320 --> 17:13.560\n and I was the second employee,\n\n17:13.560 --> 17:15.680\n it was called Quality Computers.\n\n17:15.680 --> 17:18.760\n And it was a mail order,\n\n17:18.760 --> 17:20.400\n mail order cause there's no eCommerce then,\n\n17:20.400 --> 17:21.740\n there was no internet again.\n\n17:21.740 --> 17:23.560\n You either mailed in your little coupon\n\n17:23.560 --> 17:25.280\n and you said, this is what I wanted to order\n\n17:25.280 --> 17:28.780\n or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you.\n\n17:28.780 --> 17:30.800\n Turn around time and this stuff was like,\n\n17:30.800 --> 17:32.560\n from the time you wanted, the time you bought it\n\n17:32.560 --> 17:34.520\n was maybe eight to 12 weeks.\n\n17:34.520 --> 17:37.400\n That was just the normal way of getting things.\n\n17:37.400 --> 17:42.400\n So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple too\n\n17:42.440 --> 17:46.560\n and it was software and all kinds of accessories.\n\n17:46.560 --> 17:48.080\n So hardware accessories, so hardware,\n\n17:48.080 --> 17:50.600\n plug in cards, joysticks, all this stuff.\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:55.600\n And what we noticed was there were accelerators\n\n17:55.880 --> 17:57.600\n or memory cards.\n\n17:57.600 --> 18:00.640\n And to be able to use those cards,\n\n18:00.640 --> 18:03.720\n you had to actually go and change the software you use\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:05.440\n to access this new memory.\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:07.960\n So you literally had to go and you took the program\n\n18:07.960 --> 18:09.320\n that you had, let's say it was Apple works,\n\n18:09.320 --> 18:11.280\n which was like an early Microsoft office\n\n18:11.280 --> 18:12.480\n or something like that.\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:15.880\n And you had to literally change the code\n\n18:15.880 --> 18:18.040\n and you would install all these patches\n\n18:18.040 --> 18:20.360\n to then take advantage of the hardware.\n\n18:20.360 --> 18:23.540\n So what we started creating was software on top of it\n\n18:23.540 --> 18:27.760\n to do the automatic installation of all of these patches.\n\n18:27.760 --> 18:30.520\n So we made it much easier to take new hardware\n\n18:30.520 --> 18:33.360\n and the existing software you have\n\n18:33.360 --> 18:35.360\n and expand it into this new world.\n\n18:35.360 --> 18:36.520\n So it was creating tools\n\n18:36.520 --> 18:38.280\n and the really great customer support.\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:40.960\n And we started getting a lot of orders\n\n18:40.960 --> 18:43.540\n because we had the software make it easier to install,\n\n18:43.540 --> 18:45.480\n to give them the superpower.\n\n18:45.480 --> 18:49.680\n And at the same time, they would be able\n\n18:49.680 --> 18:52.120\n to change their software and have a new world\n\n18:52.120 --> 18:53.960\n that wasn't existing from the companies\n\n18:53.960 --> 18:56.440\n that were creating the initial products.\n\n18:56.440 --> 18:58.000\n And so it was more of that.\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:00.760\n And then that happened with hard drives.\n\n19:00.760 --> 19:04.640\n So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:07.440\n to like read, because you could get really fragmented.\n\n19:07.440 --> 19:08.880\n So I wrote that piece of software\n\n19:08.880 --> 19:10.120\n and we sold that through the company\n\n19:10.120 --> 19:12.980\n along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties.\n\n19:12.980 --> 19:17.240\n So that all happened in 12th grade,\n\n19:17.240 --> 19:18.740\n freshman year of college.\n\n19:20.080 --> 19:23.200\n You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade\n\n19:23.200 --> 19:24.560\n for the Apple II.\n\n19:24.560 --> 19:26.760\n Between 12th and freshman year.\n\n19:26.760 --> 19:28.440\n What programming language do you remember?\n\n19:28.440 --> 19:29.280\n Is it assemblies?\n\n19:29.280 --> 19:32.080\n There were certain inner loops were assembly\n\n19:32.080 --> 19:35.280\n and other loops actually there were really early Pascal,\n\n19:35.280 --> 19:39.560\n no C compilers.\n\n19:39.560 --> 19:41.440\n What was the motivation behind these?\n\n19:41.440 --> 19:43.800\n Is it to make people's lives easier?\n\n19:43.800 --> 19:45.680\n Is it to create a thing experience\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:47.800\n that is simpler and simpler and simpler,\n\n19:47.800 --> 19:51.080\n thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?\n\n19:51.080 --> 19:52.960\n Or did you just like to tinker?\n\n19:52.960 --> 19:54.440\n No, no, no, it was two things really.\n\n19:54.440 --> 19:57.680\n Cause one, we wanted to sell more hardware and software.\n\n19:57.680 --> 19:59.920\n So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user.\n\n19:59.920 --> 20:01.040\n And then the other thing was,\n\n20:01.040 --> 20:03.680\n because I was also manning the customer support line,\n\n20:04.760 --> 20:06.600\n people would call in and go, this doesn't work.\n\n20:06.600 --> 20:09.120\n And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software.\n\n20:09.120 --> 20:10.880\n Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware\n\n20:10.880 --> 20:12.440\n and the installation process better.\n\n20:12.440 --> 20:16.000\n So my whole world was out of box experience\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.520\n from when I was in high school.\n\n20:18.520 --> 20:20.640\n Cause I had to man the customer support line,\n\n20:20.640 --> 20:23.000\n pack the boxes and write some of the code\n\n20:23.000 --> 20:25.280\n while we were doing, while Joe, Joe Gleason,\n\n20:25.280 --> 20:27.120\n who was the founder of Quality Computers,\n\n20:27.120 --> 20:30.160\n he was off doing the mark, the ads,\n\n20:30.160 --> 20:32.360\n placing the ads for the mail order,\n\n20:32.360 --> 20:35.920\n making sure we were running the credit cards, right?\n\n20:35.920 --> 20:36.880\n It was two of us.\n\n20:36.880 --> 20:38.360\n And then it turned into a third,\n\n20:38.360 --> 20:40.000\n and then we hired another person from high school\n\n20:40.000 --> 20:41.760\n to like pack boxes so I could stay\n\n20:41.760 --> 20:44.560\n on the customer support line or doing the software, right?\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:47.680\n And it was all in his parents basement, right?\n\n20:47.680 --> 20:50.320\n As you were scaling exponentially.\n\n20:50.320 --> 20:52.720\n Scaling, right, exactly, bootstrapping.\n\n20:52.720 --> 20:54.400\n So we'll jump around a little bit,\n\n20:54.400 --> 20:56.480\n but what were the, you said you love music.\n\n20:56.480 --> 20:59.720\n What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod\n\n20:59.720 --> 21:04.720\n if we jump forward and how far back do those ideas stretch?\n\n21:07.440 --> 21:09.560\n If you look at the history of technology,\n\n21:11.280 --> 21:14.600\n there's, I mean, not just the product,\n\n21:14.600 --> 21:17.960\n but the idea is truly revolutionary.\n\n21:17.960 --> 21:21.240\n Maybe it's time has come,\n\n21:21.240 --> 21:25.760\n but just if you look at the arc of history,\n\n21:25.760 --> 21:30.760\n sort of music is so fundamental to who we are as a humanity.\n\n21:30.760 --> 21:34.160\n And to be able to put that in your pocket,\n\n21:34.160 --> 21:36.560\n make it truly portable is fascinating\n\n21:36.560 --> 21:40.200\n in a way that's truly portable.\n\n21:40.200 --> 21:44.040\n So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman\n\n21:44.040 --> 21:45.160\n or something like that.\n\n21:45.160 --> 21:49.760\n So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?\n\n21:49.760 --> 21:53.040\n You know, I was in love with music since I was a kid.\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:55.760\n Just loved music from, I think, second grade\n\n21:55.760 --> 21:58.160\n when I got my first albums and stuff like that.\n\n21:58.160 --> 21:59.680\n What kind of music are we talking about?\n\n21:59.680 --> 22:04.000\n So this was Led Zeppelin.\n\n22:04.000 --> 22:08.200\n This was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith,\n\n22:10.720 --> 22:14.120\n Cheap Trick, Stix, Ted Nugent,\n\n22:14.120 --> 22:19.120\n just the real American and British rock and roll, right?\n\n22:19.120 --> 22:20.560\n There's a bunch of people listening right now.\n\n22:20.560 --> 22:22.040\n Who's that?\n\n22:22.040 --> 22:22.880\n Who's that?\n\n22:22.880 --> 22:23.720\n Led Zeppelin?\n\n22:23.720 --> 22:24.540\n What is that?\n\n22:24.540 --> 22:25.380\n Is that some kind?\n\n22:25.380 --> 22:26.220\n Oh, yeah.\n\n22:26.220 --> 22:29.400\n It drove my parents crazy.\n\n22:29.400 --> 22:30.240\n Yeah.\n\n22:30.240 --> 22:31.640\n You just blasted loud.\n\n22:31.640 --> 22:32.880\n Loud, just brr.\n\n22:32.880 --> 22:35.080\n And this was second, third grade, fourth grade.\n\n22:35.080 --> 22:36.120\n I just fell in love.\n\n22:36.120 --> 22:40.520\n And then we moved back to Detroit\n\n22:40.520 --> 22:43.000\n and I loved listening to the radio station\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.960\n because there was all kinds of crazy music\n\n22:44.960 --> 22:48.200\n because you'd have an amalgam of rock and then funk\n\n22:48.200 --> 22:50.320\n and R&B and I loved to listen at night.\n\n22:50.320 --> 22:51.700\n So I had a clock radio.\n\n22:52.680 --> 22:54.660\n But if I had the clock radio on,\n\n22:54.660 --> 22:57.240\n everyone, parents would go, go to sleep.\n\n22:57.240 --> 22:58.080\n Stop that.\n\n22:58.080 --> 22:58.900\n Turn that stuff off.\n\n22:58.900 --> 23:02.240\n So I hacked the clock radio and put a headphone jack in it.\n\n23:02.240 --> 23:03.720\n Nice.\n\n23:03.720 --> 23:04.560\n Right?\n\n23:04.560 --> 23:06.240\n So I said, oh, they're like, okay.\n\n23:07.080 --> 23:09.160\n And then I could listen to it all night\n\n23:09.160 --> 23:10.360\n and no one could hear me, right?\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:12.240\n And I could just sit there and, you know.\n\n23:12.240 --> 23:13.840\n Just huddling around the radio.\n\n23:13.840 --> 23:14.680\n Groove out.\n\n23:14.680 --> 23:15.920\n Just listening to Zeppelin.\n\n23:15.920 --> 23:19.200\n Stairway to Heaven, what would you say\n\n23:19.200 --> 23:23.040\n is the greatest classic rock song of all time?\n\n23:23.040 --> 23:25.500\n Greatest classic rock song of all time?\n\n23:25.500 --> 23:26.520\n What pops into mind?\n\n23:26.520 --> 23:27.720\n Well, no, you know what?\n\n23:27.720 --> 23:29.760\n I mean, this has to be objectively number one.\n\n23:29.760 --> 23:30.600\n That's really hard, dude.\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:31.420\n This is so hard.\n\n23:31.420 --> 23:32.260\n No, you have to.\n\n23:32.260 --> 23:34.580\n This is a serious journalistic interview.\n\n23:34.580 --> 23:37.040\n You're not going to back down from these kinds of questions.\n\n23:37.040 --> 23:37.880\n Oh my God.\n\n23:37.880 --> 23:38.720\n No, I don't know.\n\n23:38.720 --> 23:39.540\n What a challenge.\n\n23:39.540 --> 23:40.860\n Yeah, it's hard to pick.\n\n23:40.860 --> 23:45.640\n But to me, Stairway to Heaven is a safe fall.\n\n23:45.640 --> 23:47.840\n It's like, it's so often considered\n\n23:47.840 --> 23:49.640\n to be one of the greatest songs of all time\n\n23:49.640 --> 23:51.680\n that you almost don't want to pick it.\n\n23:51.680 --> 23:52.560\n Right, exactly.\n\n23:52.560 --> 23:54.480\n But you've returned to it time and time again.\n\n23:54.480 --> 23:58.120\n It's like, yeah, this is something pretty special.\n\n23:58.120 --> 24:00.720\n This is a rock opera of sorts.\n\n24:00.720 --> 24:03.160\n Well, the rock opera that really blew me away\n\n24:03.160 --> 24:04.720\n and still continues to blow me away\n\n24:04.720 --> 24:07.240\n is all of Dark Side of the Moon.\n\n24:07.240 --> 24:10.000\n Like that, I love Zeppelin.\n\n24:10.000 --> 24:12.120\n I can't say which one's better.\n\n24:12.120 --> 24:13.900\n But Dark Side of the Moon for me was,\n\n24:13.900 --> 24:16.800\n it was a, you know, audio experience, right?\n\n24:16.800 --> 24:18.200\n The whole thing from soup to nuts,\n\n24:18.200 --> 24:21.320\n plus all the synthesizers, all of those things.\n\n24:21.320 --> 24:23.760\n Okay, so back to the iPod.\n\n24:23.760 --> 24:26.520\n So that's, from the early age, you loved music.\n\n24:26.520 --> 24:27.540\n Loved it.\n\n24:27.540 --> 24:28.380\n Absolutely loved it.\n\n24:28.380 --> 24:30.500\n And, you know, always was just around it\n\n24:30.500 --> 24:33.600\n and always, I just, it was always playing, you know.\n\n24:34.440 --> 24:37.800\n I played it so loud that I actually hurt the earring\n\n24:37.800 --> 24:39.640\n in my right ear.\n\n24:39.640 --> 24:41.600\n And I still suffer from that today.\n\n24:41.600 --> 24:42.920\n And then.\n\n24:42.920 --> 24:43.760\n No regrets.\n\n24:43.760 --> 24:44.880\n No regrets whatsoever.\n\n24:44.880 --> 24:47.480\n Going to concerts in downtown Detroit\n\n24:47.480 --> 24:48.320\n and all the crazy stuff.\n\n24:48.320 --> 24:49.660\n So moving forward.\n\n24:50.920 --> 24:54.960\n So in college, I was a DJ.\n\n24:54.960 --> 24:58.640\n So I would DJ and hang out and play all the tunes I love\n\n24:58.640 --> 25:01.040\n and whatever for the crowd.\n\n25:01.040 --> 25:03.640\n And then I continued to do that in Silicon Valley\n\n25:03.640 --> 25:06.760\n when I moved right after school.\n\n25:06.760 --> 25:10.240\n And so I was be lugging all of these CDs around with me.\n\n25:10.240 --> 25:12.320\n A thousand CDs to, right?\n\n25:12.320 --> 25:16.740\n And at the same time, and so those were heavy.\n\n25:16.740 --> 25:20.320\n And at the same time I was doing the Philips Nino and Velo.\n\n25:20.320 --> 25:23.960\n Those were Windows CE based mobile computing products.\n\n25:25.640 --> 25:28.000\n Nino was the first device\n\n25:28.000 --> 25:30.440\n to actually put Audible books on tape.\n\n25:30.440 --> 25:32.200\n So I worked with Audible.\n\n25:32.200 --> 25:34.280\n We met in a conference and they were like,\n\n25:34.280 --> 25:35.120\n we don't want to do hardware.\n\n25:35.120 --> 25:36.160\n We just want to do content.\n\n25:36.160 --> 25:37.900\n I was like, well, we have this device.\n\n25:37.900 --> 25:39.560\n Let's get it together.\n\n25:39.560 --> 25:41.080\n And we got Audible on that.\n\n25:41.080 --> 25:46.080\n And this was in 96 or seven, first Audible books.\n\n25:46.200 --> 25:49.400\n And it, you know, I was like, oh my God, that's audio.\n\n25:49.400 --> 25:52.360\n Well, what if we put music on it, right?\n\n25:52.360 --> 25:56.180\n And so I, and the memory was very small at the time, right?\n\n25:56.180 --> 25:57.800\n There was almost no flash.\n\n25:57.800 --> 25:58.640\n It was all DRAM.\n\n25:58.640 --> 26:03.080\n When you did Audible, you stored it in DRAM, right?\n\n26:03.080 --> 26:04.760\n Which was okay probably\n\n26:04.760 --> 26:09.760\n because how much books do you need is the idea.\n\n26:09.760 --> 26:12.940\n By the way, brilliant, I mean, just putting books.\n\n26:12.940 --> 26:15.620\n I know it's probably not the sexiest of things,\n\n26:15.620 --> 26:20.620\n but putting books on a mobile device is a brilliant step.\n\n26:21.940 --> 26:23.160\n I don't know.\n\n26:23.160 --> 26:27.540\n Sometimes can't measure how much human progress occurred\n\n26:27.540 --> 26:29.140\n because of an invention.\n\n26:29.140 --> 26:32.060\n Like there's the sexy big products, but you never know.\n\n26:32.060 --> 26:34.380\n Like, like Wikipedia is one of those things\n\n26:34.380 --> 26:37.340\n that doesn't get enough, I think, credit\n\n26:37.340 --> 26:39.700\n for the transformational effects it has.\n\n26:39.700 --> 26:43.180\n It's not seen as the sexiest of products, but maybe it is.\n\n26:43.180 --> 26:47.460\n When you look at human history, Wikipedia arguably\n\n26:47.460 --> 26:48.660\n is one of the big things\n\n26:48.660 --> 26:52.660\n that basically unlocked human knowledge.\n\n26:52.660 --> 26:55.420\n Human knowledge and human editing and human, you know,\n\n26:55.420 --> 26:59.480\n just the human nature of building something together.\n\n26:59.480 --> 27:00.320\n Yeah.\n\n27:00.320 --> 27:01.540\n So it's fascinating.\n\n27:01.540 --> 27:02.960\n Sometimes you can't measure those things,\n\n27:02.960 --> 27:04.940\n maybe until many, many decades later.\n\n27:04.940 --> 27:05.900\n Anyway, sorry.\n\n27:05.900 --> 27:09.220\n So that was, that was, you know, that was, so that was there.\n\n27:09.220 --> 27:10.580\n And then there was Audible,\n\n27:10.580 --> 27:13.380\n that you put books, why not put music?\n\n27:13.380 --> 27:16.600\n Music, and I'm carrying around the music for the DJ gigs.\n\n27:16.600 --> 27:19.380\n And you're like, wait a second, two and two together, right?\n\n27:19.380 --> 27:20.640\n Like, let's get rid of this.\n\n27:20.640 --> 27:23.140\n And so, and then MP3 show up.\n\n27:23.140 --> 27:24.460\n The actual, like in COVID?\n\n27:24.460 --> 27:29.220\n The format, the format, MP3 showed up around 97, 98.\n\n27:29.220 --> 27:33.220\n So MP3 is compressed so you can have,\n\n27:34.080 --> 27:35.820\n like the storage is reduced significantly.\n\n27:35.820 --> 27:37.780\n Right, so you could go from a, you know,\n\n27:37.780 --> 27:42.020\n a large full lossless, you know,\n\n27:42.020 --> 27:45.580\n digital track into something that can be stored\n\n27:45.580 --> 27:47.700\n in four to eight megabytes,\n\n27:47.700 --> 27:49.140\n something like that for the audio.\n\n27:49.140 --> 27:51.260\n Now, you know, that's a reduced quality,\n\n27:51.260 --> 27:54.140\n but you could get it down there and you're like, oh, okay.\n\n27:54.140 --> 27:56.500\n And now if we have enough flash or DRAM,\n\n27:56.500 --> 28:00.460\n we can put 10, 15, what have you all in that same memory.\n\n28:00.460 --> 28:02.780\n And it starts to replicate a CD.\n\n28:02.780 --> 28:05.060\n And then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive,\n\n28:05.060 --> 28:07.720\n you could start to put, you know, thousands of songs.\n\n28:07.720 --> 28:10.180\n Yeah, that's also another brilliant invention.\n\n28:10.180 --> 28:11.780\n But like, people don't realize,\n\n28:11.780 --> 28:14.940\n I think people would be surprised how big\n\n28:14.940 --> 28:17.740\n in terms of storage raw audio is.\n\n28:17.740 --> 28:19.980\n And the fact that you can compress it,\n\n28:19.980 --> 28:24.020\n like, I don't know what the compression is,\n\n28:24.020 --> 28:26.820\n but it's like 10X, it's very significant compression.\n\n28:26.820 --> 28:29.700\n And still it sounds almost lossless.\n\n28:29.700 --> 28:31.700\n Much to the chagrin of Neil Young,\n\n28:31.700 --> 28:33.860\n who does not like that.\n\n28:33.860 --> 28:37.380\n But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about\n\n28:37.380 --> 28:40.700\n is still tiny files relative to the raw.\n\n28:40.700 --> 28:43.700\n So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more,\n\n28:43.700 --> 28:44.780\n a little bit more.\n\n28:44.780 --> 28:46.860\n But it's still, that's an invention.\n\n28:46.860 --> 28:49.420\n That's a thing that unlocks your ability\n\n28:49.420 --> 28:52.340\n to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music.\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:53.900\n Because without that, there's no way\n\n28:53.900 --> 28:56.300\n you can carry on a gigantic hard drive.\n\n28:56.300 --> 28:57.420\n Right, exactly.\n\n28:57.420 --> 29:01.300\n And so then that, so it was MP3s, the Nino,\n\n29:01.300 --> 29:04.580\n and my, you know, my hatred of carrying around\n\n29:04.580 --> 29:08.460\n all this heavy stuff that then spawned, you know,\n\n29:08.460 --> 29:11.460\n fuse and then ultimately, you know,\n\n29:11.460 --> 29:15.020\n became a lot of that, the ideas and things of that nature\n\n29:15.020 --> 29:19.060\n were, and my passions were born into then the iPod.\n\n29:19.060 --> 29:21.500\n You know, it was too, Apple needed something\n\n29:21.500 --> 29:24.700\n and I wanted to fix something and it all kind of,\n\n29:24.700 --> 29:27.160\n you know, came together at the right place, right time,\n\n29:27.160 --> 29:29.060\n plus the right technology came at this.\n\n29:29.060 --> 29:31.420\n It was just like the stars aligned.\n\n29:31.420 --> 29:33.500\n So how did it come to life?\n\n29:33.500 --> 29:38.500\n The details of the stars aligning, but the actual design,\n\n29:39.220 --> 29:42.900\n the actual engineering of getting a device to be small,\n\n29:42.900 --> 29:47.900\n the storage of the, you know, the interface, how it looks,\n\n29:49.140 --> 29:51.420\n the storage, the details of the software,\n\n29:51.420 --> 29:52.480\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n29:52.480 --> 29:57.020\n What are some interesting memories from that design process?\n\n29:57.020 --> 30:02.020\n What are some wisdoms you can impart from that process?\n\n30:02.020 --> 30:05.740\n Okay, well, you know, how long do you want to go?\n\n30:05.740 --> 30:07.940\n Cause I have, I can go deep.\n\n30:07.940 --> 30:11.340\n So, let's go at least 20 hours.\n\n30:11.340 --> 30:14.860\n Let's go, this is one of the lengthy documentaries.\n\n30:14.860 --> 30:18.820\n Are you going to turn it into episodic binge listening?\n\n30:18.820 --> 30:20.140\n Yeah, it's Game of Thrones.\n\n30:20.140 --> 30:23.100\n So let's just start with, you know,\n\n30:23.100 --> 30:24.660\n after I was asked to be a consultant\n\n30:24.660 --> 30:26.380\n to put this thing together.\n\n30:26.380 --> 30:28.420\n So I already had knowledge of, you know,\n\n30:28.420 --> 30:31.060\n the space and the technology and all that stuff,\n\n30:31.060 --> 30:34.700\n but I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers,\n\n30:34.700 --> 30:36.100\n because of what I was doing at Fuse,\n\n30:36.100 --> 30:37.300\n trying to create that thing.\n\n30:37.300 --> 30:42.300\n So as a contractor, I was like, okay,\n\n30:42.420 --> 30:43.700\n what is the first thing they need to do?\n\n30:43.700 --> 30:48.540\n So after I showed a, you know, different architectures\n\n30:48.540 --> 30:51.520\n and what three different products could be to Steve\n\n30:51.520 --> 30:54.740\n about options for storage options, battery options,\n\n30:54.740 --> 30:57.740\n form factor options, there was three options.\n\n30:57.740 --> 31:02.060\n And as I was told, given very good advice,\n\n31:02.060 --> 31:04.560\n give the two options you really do not like,\n\n31:04.560 --> 31:06.560\n but they're options, and give the best option last,\n\n31:06.560 --> 31:08.520\n because Steve will shoot all those down\n\n31:08.520 --> 31:10.500\n and give the best option last,\n\n31:10.500 --> 31:11.900\n and then you could talk about that.\n\n31:11.900 --> 31:16.900\n And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive\n\n31:18.820 --> 31:23.220\n and a small screen, like the screen, you know it,\n\n31:23.220 --> 31:26.860\n and the original iPod, classic iPod.\n\n31:26.860 --> 31:30.620\n And then I had enough of the idea of the three\n\n31:30.620 --> 31:35.500\n or three or four different CPUs and processor suppliers\n\n31:35.500 --> 31:37.780\n and kind of systems that were out there\n\n31:37.780 --> 31:41.380\n that I had gone and found and put together on power supplies,\n\n31:41.380 --> 31:43.760\n you know, disk drive interfaces,\n\n31:43.760 --> 31:45.460\n firewire interface, all that stuff.\n\n31:45.460 --> 31:48.660\n So I put together all of those schematics\n\n31:48.660 --> 31:49.820\n or, you know, block diagrams.\n\n31:49.820 --> 31:52.020\n They weren't schematics yet, because it was just me.\n\n31:52.020 --> 31:54.700\n And coming up with a bill of materials,\n\n31:54.700 --> 31:56.240\n coming up with what it could look like,\n\n31:56.240 --> 31:58.260\n what would be the input, output,\n\n31:58.260 --> 32:01.540\n how we could make a better headphone jack.\n\n32:02.420 --> 32:03.700\n That was also on there.\n\n32:03.700 --> 32:07.140\n Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators.\n\n32:07.140 --> 32:09.340\n So got all calculators and all kinds of electronics\n\n32:09.340 --> 32:14.340\n to get the right size, different sizes of small LCDs.\n\n32:14.980 --> 32:17.300\n So I got all kinds of different battery types.\n\n32:17.300 --> 32:19.260\n I got different types of, you know,\n\n32:19.260 --> 32:22.380\n in different battery sizes, double A's, triple A's,\n\n32:22.380 --> 32:24.280\n working through all the different,\n\n32:24.280 --> 32:26.180\n and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydride.\n\n32:26.180 --> 32:27.900\n So I took all the battery types.\n\n32:27.900 --> 32:31.980\n I took all of the memory types, processing types,\n\n32:31.980 --> 32:36.980\n LCD types, and connectivity and all that stuff,\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:40.180\n not wireless, but wired,\n\n32:40.180 --> 32:44.060\n and laid out these things as Lego blocks.\n\n32:44.060 --> 32:46.300\n So literally had all of these things as just,\n\n32:46.300 --> 32:48.900\n and so it made them so I could like, you know,\n\n32:48.900 --> 32:50.260\n put them together and figure out\n\n32:50.260 --> 32:52.940\n what the compact form factor would be.\n\n32:52.940 --> 32:55.380\n Oh, like how do we shove them together?\n\n32:55.380 --> 32:57.380\n What's the smallest possible box you can get?\n\n32:57.380 --> 33:01.220\n So the questions was on storage, so the hard drive,\n\n33:01.220 --> 33:06.020\n batteries, double A, triple A, screens.\n\n33:06.020 --> 33:07.780\n So screen size, and then for that,\n\n33:07.780 --> 33:09.980\n you're tearing apart calculators.\n\n33:09.980 --> 33:11.620\n Calculators, digital cameras, whatever,\n\n33:11.620 --> 33:12.740\n and getting little things, right?\n\n33:12.740 --> 33:14.780\n So you can make it physical, right?\n\n33:14.780 --> 33:17.060\n If you can make the intangible tangible,\n\n33:17.060 --> 33:19.180\n like, and so I can say, look, we can make this,\n\n33:19.180 --> 33:21.540\n and I brought this whole bag of goods,\n\n33:21.540 --> 33:23.580\n and it was like, right?\n\n33:23.580 --> 33:25.260\n And like, here's this, here's this,\n\n33:25.260 --> 33:26.980\n this is why double A's won't work,\n\n33:26.980 --> 33:28.540\n and because it makes it too fat and everything.\n\n33:28.540 --> 33:30.380\n So just educate everybody through,\n\n33:30.380 --> 33:32.380\n here's the parts that we can use.\n\n33:32.380 --> 33:34.060\n You should not sheet of paper, it's physical.\n\n33:34.060 --> 33:35.340\n You're playing in the physical space.\n\n33:35.340 --> 33:36.740\n Oh, I would go back and forth.\n\n33:36.740 --> 33:38.820\n So truth be told,\n\n33:38.820 --> 33:40.980\n because there weren't a good enough graphical tools\n\n33:40.980 --> 33:45.980\n on the Mac, I was using a PC with Visio and some 3D tools,\n\n33:46.380 --> 33:49.140\n and I was doing 3D design at the same time\n\n33:49.140 --> 33:51.060\n I was taking all these physical parts and going,\n\n33:51.060 --> 33:52.260\n okay, what feels right?\n\n33:52.260 --> 33:54.220\n Because you have to go from, you know,\n\n33:54.220 --> 33:56.220\n the details and then the rough,\n\n33:56.220 --> 33:58.340\n and you go back and forth and you iterate, right?\n\n33:58.340 --> 34:00.260\n And so it was just a lot of fun.\n\n34:00.260 --> 34:03.140\n And then it ultimately ended up with a styrofoam model\n\n34:03.140 --> 34:05.380\n and printouts that came from Visio\n\n34:05.380 --> 34:08.300\n that I glued together and put my grandfather's\n\n34:08.300 --> 34:09.140\n fishing weights in,\n\n34:09.140 --> 34:11.700\n because I also modeled the weights, right?\n\n34:11.700 --> 34:13.860\n So I said, oh, this is this many ounces,\n\n34:13.860 --> 34:15.660\n this is this many ounces and grams.\n\n34:15.660 --> 34:17.100\n And then I went and got all that\n\n34:17.100 --> 34:21.300\n and made the, weighted these styrofoam models\n\n34:21.300 --> 34:22.580\n to then match that.\n\n34:22.580 --> 34:23.460\n So when you picked it up,\n\n34:23.460 --> 34:25.540\n it felt more or less form factor, right?\n\n34:25.540 --> 34:27.980\n And it also, you felt how much, you know,\n\n34:27.980 --> 34:29.660\n was it gonna be dense enough?\n\n34:29.660 --> 34:34.140\n Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand, right?\n\n34:34.140 --> 34:36.060\n Why does it need to feel rigid?\n\n34:36.060 --> 34:37.740\n Because it has to feel substantial.\n\n34:37.740 --> 34:39.540\n It has to feel like I have like a,\n\n34:39.540 --> 34:41.620\n like a bar of gold in my hand, right?\n\n34:41.620 --> 34:43.500\n You know, maybe you know this,\n\n34:43.500 --> 34:45.540\n when you open and close a car door,\n\n34:45.540 --> 34:47.180\n you know that thunk and you go, bam,\n\n34:47.180 --> 34:49.340\n and you go, that feels solid, that feels real.\n\n34:49.340 --> 34:52.340\n And then you get this tinny car that's like ding,\n\n34:52.340 --> 34:54.460\n and you're like, does this feel safe?\n\n34:54.460 --> 34:55.980\n Does this feel like a value?\n\n34:55.980 --> 34:58.380\n And so you, when you have a device like that,\n\n34:58.380 --> 35:00.980\n and you wanna make sure that there's not too much air in it,\n\n35:00.980 --> 35:04.780\n that you distributed the density of the masses\n\n35:04.780 --> 35:05.700\n in the right way.\n\n35:05.700 --> 35:07.540\n So it feels like it's the right thing.\n\n35:07.540 --> 35:12.140\n So you have to model battery life, costs,\n\n35:12.140 --> 35:16.140\n you know, mass, sizes of different things.\n\n35:16.140 --> 35:17.420\n And then you have to also think about\n\n35:17.420 --> 35:19.140\n what the UI is gonna look like, right?\n\n35:19.140 --> 35:21.140\n You have all of these constraints you're working,\n\n35:21.140 --> 35:22.500\n variables you're working with,\n\n35:22.500 --> 35:24.220\n and you have to kind of, you know,\n\n35:24.220 --> 35:26.260\n you can't get the perfect of everything.\n\n35:26.260 --> 35:29.220\n What's the best, you know, local maximum\n\n35:29.220 --> 35:31.260\n of all of these components that come together\n\n35:31.260 --> 35:32.380\n to provide an experience?\n\n35:32.380 --> 35:34.260\n Local maximum, it's always trade offs.\n\n35:34.260 --> 35:35.700\n What about buttons?\n\n35:35.700 --> 35:37.860\n Buttons, well, there was also the buttons too, right?\n\n35:37.860 --> 35:39.500\n Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles\n\n35:39.500 --> 35:41.900\n fought inside your mind, or is it with other people?\n\n35:41.900 --> 35:44.820\n Is it with Steve, is it lower, like what?\n\n35:44.820 --> 35:46.100\n This was all independent.\n\n35:46.100 --> 35:48.500\n This was me before being able to present to Steve,\n\n35:48.500 --> 35:51.020\n because I had to feel really confident\n\n35:51.020 --> 35:53.940\n that if I was gonna put this in front of him,\n\n35:53.940 --> 35:55.260\n that it could be made, right?\n\n35:55.260 --> 35:56.980\n So I had to convince myself\n\n35:56.980 --> 35:58.580\n and go work through all the details,\n\n35:58.580 --> 36:01.340\n through like the very, very rough mechanical design,\n\n36:01.340 --> 36:03.820\n electrical design, software things,\n\n36:03.820 --> 36:05.260\n because I didn't wanna present something\n\n36:05.260 --> 36:07.020\n that was gonna be fictional, right?\n\n36:07.020 --> 36:10.180\n My credibility would be like trashed, right?\n\n36:10.180 --> 36:12.020\n So you mentioned convince yourself.\n\n36:13.140 --> 36:15.700\n You're painting this beautiful picture\n\n36:15.700 --> 36:19.700\n of a driven engineer, designer, futurist.\n\n36:21.900 --> 36:24.900\n How much doubt were you plagued by through that?\n\n36:24.900 --> 36:26.340\n Like this is even doable,\n\n36:26.340 --> 36:29.900\n because it's not obvious that this is even doable.\n\n36:29.900 --> 36:33.100\n Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing,\n\n36:33.100 --> 36:38.100\n to make it sexy, to shovel the screen,\n\n36:39.700 --> 36:42.620\n the batteries, the storage, to make the interface,\n\n36:42.620 --> 36:45.140\n the hardware and the software interface work, all of that.\n\n36:45.140 --> 36:46.100\n I mean, I don't know.\n\n36:46.100 --> 36:48.220\n I would be overwhelmed by the doubt of that,\n\n36:48.220 --> 36:51.580\n because so many things have to work, plus the supply chain.\n\n36:51.580 --> 36:52.660\n Like at that point,\n\n36:52.660 --> 36:55.580\n I wasn't getting into any of those details or anything.\n\n36:55.580 --> 36:58.660\n There's the basic stuff that you have to put together.\n\n36:58.660 --> 37:00.300\n And then you have to,\n\n37:00.300 --> 37:01.860\n through my learnings at General Magic\n\n37:01.860 --> 37:02.940\n and my learnings at Phillips\n\n37:02.940 --> 37:06.940\n and delivering multiple large scale programs\n\n37:06.940 --> 37:09.180\n and manufacturing, you kind of get a rule of thumb\n\n37:09.180 --> 37:11.300\n and you know what to focus on at the beginning\n\n37:11.300 --> 37:13.500\n and what not to worry about over time.\n\n37:13.500 --> 37:14.820\n Like when I was early in my career,\n\n37:14.820 --> 37:16.940\n I worried about everything on the engineering details\n\n37:16.940 --> 37:19.780\n so much so that I would be a nervous wreck.\n\n37:19.780 --> 37:21.700\n Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out\n\n37:21.700 --> 37:23.660\n and figure out what to prioritize.\n\n37:23.660 --> 37:25.300\n And so 10 years later,\n\n37:25.300 --> 37:27.340\n I was able to do a much better job\n\n37:27.340 --> 37:29.380\n of filtering out the things of like,\n\n37:29.380 --> 37:31.740\n we'll get to that in weeks to come.\n\n37:31.740 --> 37:36.100\n But right now we gotta solve the very important things,\n\n37:36.100 --> 37:39.260\n which is could this actually be something real\n\n37:39.260 --> 37:42.700\n and that you could deliver enough battery life, right?\n\n37:42.700 --> 37:46.860\n Enough of an interface of the right cost, right?\n\n37:46.860 --> 37:49.060\n And the right price point.\n\n37:49.060 --> 37:51.620\n So you were sitting on a track record\n\n37:51.620 --> 37:54.460\n of successes and failures in your own mind\n\n37:54.460 --> 37:57.300\n where you had sort of already a confidence,\n\n37:57.300 --> 38:01.260\n a calmness, but still,\n\n38:01.260 --> 38:03.500\n was there a doubt that you can get this done?\n\n38:03.500 --> 38:05.180\n Always, always.\n\n38:05.180 --> 38:08.460\n How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence\n\n38:08.460 --> 38:10.300\n to a level where you could present it to Steve\n\n38:10.300 --> 38:13.460\n and actually believe that this is doable?\n\n38:13.460 --> 38:15.300\n Like what, do you remember when you felt?\n\n38:15.300 --> 38:16.140\n Yeah, that moment?\n\n38:16.140 --> 38:16.980\n Yeah.\n\n38:16.980 --> 38:19.540\n I think it was after I triple checked my,\n\n38:19.540 --> 38:22.540\n I couldn't bring anyone in, right?\n\n38:22.540 --> 38:24.460\n I couldn't let anyone in on this.\n\n38:24.460 --> 38:25.940\n So it was just me.\n\n38:25.940 --> 38:27.660\n Are they gonna trample on it, that kind of thing?\n\n38:27.660 --> 38:28.500\n Why? No, no, no, no,\n\n38:28.500 --> 38:29.540\n because I couldn't bring any,\n\n38:29.540 --> 38:31.220\n when I mean bring anyone in on this,\n\n38:31.220 --> 38:33.780\n one, it was a highly confidential program inside Apple.\n\n38:33.780 --> 38:36.500\n There was like four people who knew about it, right?\n\n38:36.500 --> 38:38.220\n And so I couldn't bring anyone from Apple\n\n38:38.220 --> 38:40.060\n because I was a contractor.\n\n38:40.060 --> 38:42.100\n I couldn't bring anyone else from the outside world.\n\n38:42.100 --> 38:45.460\n I'm working for Apple and I'm under this crazy NDA, right?\n\n38:45.460 --> 38:46.580\n In this contract.\n\n38:46.580 --> 38:50.740\n So it was just, so I'm doing this.\n\n38:50.740 --> 38:51.660\n Oh, and at the same time,\n\n38:51.660 --> 38:54.180\n I'm also buying every competitive product, MP3 player\n\n38:54.180 --> 38:55.900\n and tearing them all apart, right?\n\n38:55.900 --> 38:58.300\n Tore them all apart and looking at them\n\n38:58.300 --> 39:00.100\n and trying to learn from those as well.\n\n39:00.100 --> 39:02.340\n So it was all of this stuff in six weeks.\n\n39:02.340 --> 39:05.380\n So I didn't sleep, right?\n\n39:05.380 --> 39:06.420\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n39:06.420 --> 39:09.340\n But I was like, because I was trying to make this,\n\n39:09.340 --> 39:12.740\n I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?\n\n39:12.740 --> 39:15.220\n And I was like, oh my God, right?\n\n39:15.220 --> 39:17.140\n But there was another doubt that I had\n\n39:17.140 --> 39:19.540\n and it wasn't just, could you make the product?\n\n39:19.540 --> 39:24.540\n But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?\n\n39:25.140 --> 39:27.220\n Because Apple was not the same company\n\n39:28.740 --> 39:31.500\n that you know it today in 2001.\n\n39:31.500 --> 39:34.060\n Really, it was cautious, conservative, careful?\n\n39:34.060 --> 39:36.300\n No, no, it was barely break even.\n\n39:36.300 --> 39:39.460\n It was a four or $5 billion company.\n\n39:39.460 --> 39:42.100\n So the guts required there is not necessarily\n\n39:42.100 --> 39:43.020\n in the innovation.\n\n39:43.020 --> 39:45.220\n It's like, this is gonna cost a lot of money\n\n39:45.220 --> 39:47.100\n and we're gonna potentially lose all of it\n\n39:47.100 --> 39:49.620\n because it'll be a flop.\n\n39:49.620 --> 39:52.980\n Well, there's not just that, but there was only the Mac.\n\n39:52.980 --> 39:55.580\n And the Mac wasn't doing very well.\n\n39:55.580 --> 39:57.540\n There was less, it was about a 1%\n\n39:57.540 --> 40:01.020\n only in the US market share for the Mac, right?\n\n40:01.020 --> 40:02.660\n The company was in debt.\n\n40:02.660 --> 40:07.620\n Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?\n\n40:07.620 --> 40:09.780\n Michael Dell at the time was saying,\n\n40:09.780 --> 40:11.700\n shut down the company and give the money back\n\n40:11.700 --> 40:12.980\n to the shareholders.\n\n40:13.900 --> 40:17.380\n So this is not the company that people,\n\n40:17.380 --> 40:18.860\n oh my God, the iPhone came out.\n\n40:18.860 --> 40:20.620\n It's a very different level of confidence\n\n40:20.620 --> 40:24.300\n and financial situation that the company was in\n\n40:24.300 --> 40:25.540\n versus the iPod.\n\n40:25.540 --> 40:27.580\n So given that, what was the conversation\n\n40:27.580 --> 40:29.420\n when you finally presented to Steve?\n\n40:29.420 --> 40:33.180\n Steve, what was that conversation like?\n\n40:34.260 --> 40:37.860\n The conversation was, well, we went through it,\n\n40:37.860 --> 40:40.780\n the presentation and all that stuff happened.\n\n40:40.780 --> 40:43.420\n And he was just like, and he never,\n\n40:43.420 --> 40:45.500\n he would flip through it real quick,\n\n40:45.500 --> 40:47.180\n throw the presentation aside and said,\n\n40:47.180 --> 40:49.700\n okay, let's talk about this, right?\n\n40:49.700 --> 40:51.340\n And so we went through it all.\n\n40:51.340 --> 40:55.660\n And one was a big conversation about Sony.\n\n40:55.660 --> 40:59.420\n And Sony was the number one in all audio categories,\n\n40:59.420 --> 41:02.980\n home, portable, whatever, in the world, okay?\n\n41:03.980 --> 41:06.420\n I had been already gone through 10 years of failure.\n\n41:06.420 --> 41:07.260\n And I was like, wait a second,\n\n41:07.260 --> 41:08.900\n how are we gonna compete with Sony?\n\n41:10.340 --> 41:12.620\n And I was always worried that Sony\n\n41:12.620 --> 41:14.180\n was gonna come out with whatever it was\n\n41:14.180 --> 41:16.460\n that they were gonna come out with, their MP3 player.\n\n41:16.460 --> 41:18.900\n And that was it, game over, right?\n\n41:19.860 --> 41:22.260\n And so I was like, Steve,\n\n41:22.260 --> 41:26.140\n Steve, and this is why it took me four weeks\n\n41:26.140 --> 41:27.900\n to finally sign on to join Apple\n\n41:27.900 --> 41:32.020\n after he green lighted the iPod program in that meeting,\n\n41:32.020 --> 41:35.140\n was because I had built other things in the past\n\n41:35.140 --> 41:36.740\n at Phillips, the Nino and Velo,\n\n41:36.740 --> 41:38.780\n but they didn't know how to sell it or market it.\n\n41:38.780 --> 41:41.340\n They didn't know how to retail it, right?\n\n41:41.340 --> 41:42.820\n So I was like, we could build this.\n\n41:42.820 --> 41:45.100\n And I was like, Steve, I'm pretty sure I can build this.\n\n41:45.100 --> 41:48.980\n I've done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?\n\n41:48.980 --> 41:52.820\n You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac.\n\n41:52.820 --> 41:55.420\n And he looked at me and he goes, you build this\n\n41:55.420 --> 41:57.460\n with, you know, a team and our team and Apple\n\n41:57.460 --> 41:59.500\n and this and this and the me, right?\n\n41:59.500 --> 42:02.940\n And I dedicate that we will make sure\n\n42:02.940 --> 42:05.500\n that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars\n\n42:05.500 --> 42:08.860\n will only go to this product and nothing else.\n\n42:08.860 --> 42:10.260\n Wow.\n\n42:10.260 --> 42:14.140\n Right, Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company.\n\n42:14.140 --> 42:16.980\n So Steve saw something special here.\n\n42:16.980 --> 42:19.820\n Exactly, and he said, I'm going to commit\n\n42:19.820 --> 42:21.620\n all the marketing dollars if you can deliver\n\n42:21.620 --> 42:24.380\n the experience that we're all talking about,\n\n42:24.380 --> 42:26.140\n if we can do that, and that was Jeff Robin as well,\n\n42:26.140 --> 42:29.140\n because iPod would have never happened without iTunes.\n\n42:29.140 --> 42:31.260\n You know, people don't understand that was a bundle.\n\n42:31.260 --> 42:33.660\n You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa.\n\n42:33.660 --> 42:36.740\n So Jeff and I were, you know, if Jeff and you can present\n\n42:36.740 --> 42:40.780\n and bring that experience to life,\n\n42:40.780 --> 42:42.620\n I will put all the marketing dollars behind it.\n\n42:42.620 --> 42:47.140\n When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of,\n\n42:48.340 --> 42:53.220\n what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?\n\n42:53.220 --> 42:56.220\n iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?\n\n42:56.220 --> 42:58.540\n And so Jeff Robin had his company,\n\n42:58.540 --> 43:00.820\n oh man, I can't remember the name, but it was bought.\n\n43:00.820 --> 43:04.500\n He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac.\n\n43:05.780 --> 43:08.180\n Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps\n\n43:08.180 --> 43:10.580\n like Winamp and other things that were on the PC,\n\n43:10.580 --> 43:13.900\n real player, and Steve saw that going on\n\n43:13.900 --> 43:17.820\n and saw that Jeff and his small team had this,\n\n43:17.820 --> 43:19.740\n I can't remember, sound something.\n\n43:19.740 --> 43:22.980\n Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes\n\n43:22.980 --> 43:24.860\n and then Jeff ran all of iTunes.\n\n43:24.860 --> 43:27.900\n And so what happened specifically there was\n\n43:27.900 --> 43:28.900\n they were starting to hook up\n\n43:28.900 --> 43:31.340\n to all these third party MP3 players\n\n43:31.340 --> 43:34.580\n because there's a lot of Korean, the MP man,\n\n43:34.580 --> 43:36.780\n like Walkman, but MP man, all these,\n\n43:36.780 --> 43:38.300\n and they were trying to hook them up\n\n43:38.300 --> 43:41.180\n and they were like, these are horrible experiences.\n\n43:41.180 --> 43:43.420\n And through that, and they said,\n\n43:43.420 --> 43:46.580\n iTunes was something that was gonna help grow the Mac base\n\n43:46.580 --> 43:49.420\n because we were trying to get more on the Mac.\n\n43:49.420 --> 43:51.580\n So this program would be a great new thing\n\n43:51.580 --> 43:53.060\n you could add to the Mac.\n\n43:53.060 --> 43:55.020\n And there was also internet connectivity at the time\n\n43:55.020 --> 43:56.020\n for the iMac.\n\n43:56.020 --> 43:57.740\n And so they did that\n\n43:57.740 --> 44:00.140\n and then they're trying to do these hookups.\n\n44:00.140 --> 44:01.300\n They weren't going well.\n\n44:01.300 --> 44:04.540\n And that's when they said, we need to build our own.\n\n44:04.540 --> 44:06.180\n Or Steve said, we need to build our own\n\n44:06.180 --> 44:08.020\n since these are such horrible experiences.\n\n44:08.020 --> 44:10.660\n People don't wanna just burn CDs from iTunes.\n\n44:10.660 --> 44:12.940\n We need to get that music on the go,\n\n44:12.940 --> 44:14.420\n but in an Apple fashion.\n\n44:14.420 --> 44:18.420\n That's when I was called to come in to do that,\n\n44:18.420 --> 44:20.900\n the iPod thing after the six weeks.\n\n44:20.900 --> 44:24.300\n Then he already envisioned, I'm sure he had it envisioned\n\n44:24.300 --> 44:26.740\n because they were trying to do this thing.\n\n44:26.740 --> 44:28.380\n Okay, now that's it.\n\n44:28.380 --> 44:32.500\n iTunes, it wasn't called iPod yet.\n\n44:32.500 --> 44:33.820\n What would become the iPod?\n\n44:33.820 --> 44:36.580\n That is gonna be the thing that then propels Apple\n\n44:36.580 --> 44:37.420\n into this new thing\n\n44:37.420 --> 44:39.740\n because you're gonna bring all these music lovers in\n\n44:39.740 --> 44:43.740\n that are gonna need their next generation\n\n44:43.740 --> 44:46.900\n or Sony Walkman version 2.0.\n\n44:46.900 --> 44:51.740\n So when you look at, again, apologies to linger on iPod,\n\n44:51.740 --> 44:56.560\n but it's one of the great inventions in tech history.\n\n44:58.220 --> 45:00.800\n What wisdom do you draw from that whole process\n\n45:00.800 --> 45:03.660\n about spotting an idea?\n\n45:03.660 --> 45:07.540\n This is something you talk about in your book, Build.\n\n45:09.100 --> 45:11.480\n How do you know that an idea is brilliant?\n\n45:11.480 --> 45:12.780\n At which stage?\n\n45:12.780 --> 45:14.640\n When did you know it was a good idea?\n\n45:16.260 --> 45:21.260\n And maybe is there like some phase shifts?\n\n45:22.020 --> 45:25.140\n First you complete out, then maybe,\n\n45:25.140 --> 45:27.140\n and then maybe it becomes more than a hmm\n\n45:27.140 --> 45:29.020\n and becomes like a little more confidence,\n\n45:29.020 --> 45:29.920\n that kind of stuff.\n\n45:29.920 --> 45:34.020\n And also wisdom about who to talk to\n\n45:35.660 --> 45:37.900\n so they don't trample the idea in their early stages,\n\n45:37.900 --> 45:39.020\n that kind of stuff.\n\n45:39.020 --> 45:40.260\n Any thoughts about this?\n\n45:40.260 --> 45:41.580\n We could go on again.\n\n45:41.580 --> 45:42.660\n How long do you wanna go?\n\n45:42.660 --> 45:45.940\n 20, this is a Netflix series, I told you.\n\n45:45.940 --> 45:47.260\n Multi season.\n\n45:47.260 --> 45:51.060\n So a lot of lessons learned over those years of failure\n\n45:51.060 --> 45:55.860\n and success, but the first thing it starts with,\n\n45:55.860 --> 45:58.700\n there's a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You.\n\n45:58.700 --> 46:00.700\n And so it kind of goes into in Build\n\n46:00.700 --> 46:03.060\n and it goes through kind of chapter and verse\n\n46:03.060 --> 46:07.420\n about all of those, how Nest became into being.\n\n46:07.420 --> 46:10.840\n But let's talk about it specifically for iPod, right?\n\n46:10.840 --> 46:13.540\n So for me, I always had pain,\n\n46:13.540 --> 46:16.660\n the pain of carrying these CDs everywhere, right?\n\n46:16.660 --> 46:19.700\n And I had the joy of music, right?\n\n46:19.700 --> 46:21.740\n If you could say, all of a sudden I could get\n\n46:21.740 --> 46:25.800\n the music I love all the time in a portable package\n\n46:25.800 --> 46:28.060\n and I can have all the music I love all the time,\n\n46:28.060 --> 46:30.540\n I was solving a pain, which was,\n\n46:30.540 --> 46:31.800\n for me it was thousands of CDs,\n\n46:31.800 --> 46:34.940\n other people might be 10 or 15 CDs, right?\n\n46:34.940 --> 46:38.860\n And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted.\n\n46:38.860 --> 46:43.180\n That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it.\n\n46:43.180 --> 46:45.340\n And then at the end was a superpower,\n\n46:45.340 --> 46:47.100\n an emotional superpower that said,\n\n46:47.100 --> 46:50.540\n oh my, this is something different.\n\n46:50.540 --> 46:53.320\n So when you can actually focus on a pain,\n\n46:53.320 --> 46:57.380\n not and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin.\n\n46:57.380 --> 46:58.780\n So the difference between a painkiller\n\n46:58.780 --> 46:59.940\n and a vitamin is very clear.\n\n46:59.940 --> 47:02.900\n One, you need, I gotta get rid of this pain.\n\n47:02.900 --> 47:05.340\n A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,\n\n47:05.340 --> 47:06.840\n maybe somebody needs it, maybe not,\n\n47:06.840 --> 47:08.960\n it's all marketing story, right?\n\n47:08.960 --> 47:11.580\n So you start with the pain, give them a painkiller,\n\n47:11.580 --> 47:13.820\n and hopefully if you can do it in the right way,\n\n47:13.820 --> 47:17.420\n you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower.\n\n47:17.420 --> 47:21.580\n That is always, and that's the way to know\n\n47:21.580 --> 47:23.740\n that you're hitting on something that's really powerful.\n\n47:23.740 --> 47:28.740\n The pain and the joy, are you always aware of the pain?\n\n47:31.360 --> 47:34.300\n So it seems like a lot of great products,\n\n47:34.300 --> 47:36.340\n it's like we do a lot of painful things\n\n47:36.340 --> 47:40.460\n and we just kind of assume that's the way it's supposed\n\n47:40.460 --> 47:42.620\n to be, like with autonomous vehicles,\n\n47:42.620 --> 47:45.260\n we'll all assume we're supposed to be driving.\n\n47:46.620 --> 47:50.500\n And it doesn't, you don't think of it as a pain.\n\n47:50.500 --> 47:54.100\n Right, well, you've habituated it away.\n\n47:54.100 --> 47:55.100\n You've habituated it away.\n\n47:55.100 --> 47:58.820\n For me, when I go to other places,\n\n47:58.820 --> 48:01.020\n living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever,\n\n48:01.020 --> 48:05.060\n and I'm not driving, I'm walking or I'm using a scooter\n\n48:05.060 --> 48:06.780\n or what have you, different thing,\n\n48:06.780 --> 48:10.200\n and you go, oh my God, when you left that environment,\n\n48:10.200 --> 48:12.300\n because everyone else is driving all the time,\n\n48:12.300 --> 48:13.540\n you're like, that's what you do.\n\n48:13.540 --> 48:15.580\n And you find out there's other ways of living\n\n48:15.580 --> 48:17.540\n and there's freedom when you get rid of that,\n\n48:17.540 --> 48:20.580\n you're like, oh my God, I didn't know\n\n48:20.580 --> 48:21.740\n that this was so much better.\n\n48:21.740 --> 48:24.700\n So there's something in the book that's called out\n\n48:24.700 --> 48:27.460\n and I deemed it the virus of doubt.\n\n48:27.460 --> 48:30.980\n And what the virus of doubt is, is when there's pain\n\n48:30.980 --> 48:33.200\n and it's been habituated away,\n\n48:33.200 --> 48:35.860\n you use the right marketing messages\n\n48:35.860 --> 48:39.460\n to bring people back to that initial experience they had\n\n48:39.460 --> 48:42.200\n or the initial experience that they had of that pain.\n\n48:42.200 --> 48:45.540\n Do you remember when the first time you did blah\n\n48:45.540 --> 48:48.940\n and it felt like this, right?\n\n48:48.940 --> 48:53.340\n And then you reawaken that habituated pain\n\n48:54.500 --> 48:56.980\n and people, and it becomes visceral\n\n48:56.980 --> 49:01.140\n and then they're like, oh, yes, I hate that.\n\n49:01.140 --> 49:04.020\n And then you go, now I have the painkiller\n\n49:04.020 --> 49:05.780\n and the joy for you.\n\n49:05.780 --> 49:08.020\n That's when it all comes together and it goes.\n\n49:10.560 --> 49:12.700\n Let me, on this, on the pain and the joy\n\n49:12.700 --> 49:17.700\n that's brilliantly put, you mentioned selling\n\n49:17.740 --> 49:19.700\n and marketing, right?\n\n49:19.700 --> 49:21.180\n Marketing dollars.\n\n49:22.860 --> 49:25.220\n I have a love, hate relationship with marketing,\n\n49:26.940 --> 49:30.900\n like with a lot of things that require artistic genius.\n\n49:30.900 --> 49:34.060\n To me, the best marketing, I suppose,\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:37.420\n is the product itself and then word of mouth.\n\n49:37.420 --> 49:40.380\n So like create a thing that people love.\n\n49:40.380 --> 49:41.900\n Oh, absolutely, that's fundamental.\n\n49:41.900 --> 49:46.540\n Yeah, so any other marketing requires genius\n\n49:46.540 --> 49:48.460\n to be any extra thing.\n\n49:48.460 --> 49:53.460\n Because to me, I don't, yeah, maybe you can,\n\n49:54.620 --> 49:59.340\n by way of question, I'm just speaking off the top\n\n49:59.340 --> 50:03.660\n of my head as a consumer, what is great marketing?\n\n50:03.660 --> 50:07.100\n What does it take to reveal the pain\n\n50:07.100 --> 50:08.260\n and the joy of a thing?\n\n50:08.260 --> 50:09.460\n Okay.\n\n50:09.460 --> 50:11.820\n It all starts at the beginning.\n\n50:11.820 --> 50:13.780\n And let me give you, I'm gonna give you a couple\n\n50:13.780 --> 50:15.860\n of different ways of looking at it, okay?\n\n50:15.860 --> 50:18.460\n And again, we might go a little long here.\n\n50:18.460 --> 50:22.220\n So just stay tuned in.\n\n50:22.220 --> 50:23.060\n So the first thing is.\n\n50:23.060 --> 50:23.900\n Start at the beginning.\n\n50:23.900 --> 50:26.020\n Let's start at the beginning.\n\n50:26.020 --> 50:29.340\n In the early part of my career, like General Magic\n\n50:29.340 --> 50:31.160\n and Philips and what have you,\n\n50:33.580 --> 50:36.380\n and especially when I was a teenager,\n\n50:36.380 --> 50:39.900\n when I was making my own chips and stuff like that,\n\n50:39.900 --> 50:44.100\n I really worried about just putting cool things together.\n\n50:44.100 --> 50:46.540\n I'm like that, when I put those two cool things together\n\n50:46.540 --> 50:48.860\n as an engineer, you go, that's cool.\n\n50:48.860 --> 50:50.460\n And then I would talk to the other friends\n\n50:50.460 --> 50:53.260\n who might be geeks too, and they go, yeah, that's cool.\n\n50:54.180 --> 50:57.020\n Because we knew the bits, so we put them together\n\n50:57.020 --> 50:58.220\n and that's a new way of doing it.\n\n50:58.220 --> 51:02.820\n And you're like, wow, that's all what?\n\n51:02.820 --> 51:03.940\n It's not why?\n\n51:04.840 --> 51:06.340\n Why are you doing this?\n\n51:06.340 --> 51:08.300\n We know what we're doing, but we don't know\n\n51:08.300 --> 51:10.340\n why we're doing it, because we're not articulating it\n\n51:10.340 --> 51:12.180\n for ourselves, because it's just something\n\n51:12.180 --> 51:14.140\n we're like putting it together and like, yeah, that's cool\n\n51:14.140 --> 51:17.900\n because we think we're solving some problem we have,\n\n51:17.900 --> 51:19.700\n but we're not really articulating it.\n\n51:19.700 --> 51:21.820\n So what normally happens, and this happens\n\n51:21.820 --> 51:24.940\n because we invest in so many companies around the world,\n\n51:24.940 --> 51:26.980\n you have these brilliant engineers, designers,\n\n51:26.980 --> 51:31.560\n scientists, researchers, they put together these what's.\n\n51:32.620 --> 51:35.780\n And then they develop it, develop it, develop it.\n\n51:35.780 --> 51:38.180\n And then at the end, they call in marketing\n\n51:38.180 --> 51:40.660\n and say, now tell a story about this\n\n51:40.660 --> 51:42.920\n and let's get it out to the world, okay?\n\n51:43.940 --> 51:46.380\n What happens then is marketing is like,\n\n51:46.380 --> 51:48.300\n well, why do people need this?\n\n51:48.300 --> 51:50.180\n Tell us why people need it.\n\n51:50.180 --> 51:53.560\n And so they create a story around this product,\n\n51:54.440 --> 51:56.940\n but the product was born out of what's, not why's.\n\n51:57.780 --> 52:00.700\n And so they start telling, marketing starts telling a story\n\n52:00.700 --> 52:03.500\n and it turns out to be a fictional story usually.\n\n52:03.500 --> 52:06.200\n They say, oh, this is going to do these things.\n\n52:06.200 --> 52:07.940\n The product comes in as delivered.\n\n52:07.940 --> 52:10.100\n And it falls flat on its face\n\n52:10.100 --> 52:12.940\n because the marketing doesn't match the product\n\n52:12.940 --> 52:14.500\n because they weren't both created\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:17.940\n at the beginning together, right?\n\n52:17.940 --> 52:19.700\n There are what's when you create a product,\n\n52:19.700 --> 52:21.380\n but there's a lot more why's\n\n52:21.380 --> 52:23.700\n and the why's help inform the what's.\n\n52:23.700 --> 52:27.020\n And the why's also inform the marketing.\n\n52:27.020 --> 52:31.020\n So that's what you mean deeply\n\n52:31.020 --> 52:32.620\n at we should start at the beginning.\n\n52:32.620 --> 52:35.580\n So the designer should be also the marketer.\n\n52:35.580 --> 52:37.940\n The engineer should be the marketer.\n\n52:37.940 --> 52:38.780\n Exactly.\n\n52:38.780 --> 52:40.540\n Stop impressing the geek next to you.\n\n52:40.540 --> 52:42.540\n What is the superpower you're bringing\n\n52:42.540 --> 52:47.540\n or the pain you're killing for the end customer, right?\n\n52:48.020 --> 52:49.920\n Now let's contrast that.\n\n52:51.540 --> 52:53.020\n Think about a movie.\n\n52:53.020 --> 52:54.860\n A movie starts with a treatment.\n\n52:54.860 --> 52:55.940\n It has an audience.\n\n52:55.940 --> 52:56.820\n This has the audience.\n\n52:56.820 --> 52:57.700\n Here's the characters.\n\n52:57.700 --> 52:59.160\n Here's the storyline, the plot.\n\n52:59.160 --> 53:02.660\n Here's the arc of the story, right?\n\n53:02.660 --> 53:04.580\n It pulls that all out.\n\n53:04.580 --> 53:07.180\n Then there's a script that's written.\n\n53:07.180 --> 53:09.520\n And that script is then produced.\n\n53:09.520 --> 53:11.060\n And then you add all the flourishes\n\n53:11.060 --> 53:13.100\n and what have you music and graphics\n\n53:13.100 --> 53:14.700\n and what have you, right?\n\n53:14.700 --> 53:15.820\n And then it comes out\n\n53:15.820 --> 53:17.260\n and then there's the marketing of the movie.\n\n53:17.260 --> 53:19.680\n And that story was created at the beginning.\n\n53:19.680 --> 53:22.780\n What you need to do if you're gonna do a great product\n\n53:22.780 --> 53:24.940\n is create that treatment for your product.\n\n53:24.940 --> 53:26.980\n And I call that the press release.\n\n53:26.980 --> 53:30.500\n Do the press release like the treatment.\n\n53:30.500 --> 53:31.620\n Who's the audience?\n\n53:31.620 --> 53:33.260\n What features do you have?\n\n53:33.260 --> 53:35.100\n What pains are you solving for people?\n\n53:35.100 --> 53:37.820\n Have the virus of doubt there to remind them\n\n53:37.820 --> 53:40.060\n what pains they have and why you're solving them.\n\n53:40.060 --> 53:41.820\n The price, all of those things.\n\n53:41.820 --> 53:46.660\n And you use that as the bar, the measuring stick\n\n53:46.660 --> 53:48.540\n for what you do during development.\n\n53:48.540 --> 53:51.780\n Because what happens that along the route, you know this.\n\n53:52.620 --> 53:53.460\n Oh, we're not gonna be able\n\n53:53.460 --> 53:55.420\n to get that feature done on time.\n\n53:55.420 --> 53:56.380\n Throw that one overboard.\n\n53:56.380 --> 53:58.540\n We gotta hit the, we have to hit the date.\n\n53:58.540 --> 54:01.020\n Oh, we're not sure this product's right yet.\n\n54:01.020 --> 54:02.620\n Add another feature.\n\n54:02.620 --> 54:05.340\n Add another feature creep, right?\n\n54:05.340 --> 54:06.500\n If you don't have that story\n\n54:06.500 --> 54:08.500\n you know you're gonna tell at the beginning,\n\n54:08.500 --> 54:11.300\n you don't have that bar, right?\n\n54:11.300 --> 54:13.740\n And then at the end, you don't know when you're done\n\n54:13.740 --> 54:14.560\n if you don't have that story.\n\n54:14.560 --> 54:16.940\n So you can actually look at that press release.\n\n54:16.940 --> 54:21.900\n You know, you change it over time, that draft.\n\n54:21.900 --> 54:24.880\n But then when you're done, you know the what's and the whys.\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:26.900\n You have all the things, the audience and everything.\n\n54:26.900 --> 54:29.500\n And then you can give that to marketing and say,\n\n54:29.500 --> 54:32.100\n well, and marketing has been along the way, let's be clear.\n\n54:32.100 --> 54:33.900\n But then everybody's in sync.\n\n54:33.900 --> 54:35.580\n And that's when you can tell a cohesive,\n\n54:35.580 --> 54:37.700\n non fictional story about,\n\n54:37.700 --> 54:39.600\n and the product delivers on that story\n\n54:39.600 --> 54:41.980\n or hopefully over delivers on that story.\n\n54:41.980 --> 54:45.860\n So in the drafting from the beginning\n\n54:45.860 --> 54:47.760\n to the end of the press release,\n\n54:47.760 --> 54:49.860\n what does a successful team look like?\n\n54:49.860 --> 54:51.500\n Who's part of the draft?\n\n54:51.500 --> 54:53.560\n Is it engineers, designers?\n\n54:53.560 --> 54:56.760\n What's the purpose of a marketing department\n\n54:56.760 --> 54:59.800\n in a company, small, let's say small company,\n\n54:59.800 --> 55:02.460\n but more than two people?\n\n55:02.460 --> 55:06.900\n So from where does the why come from?\n\n55:06.900 --> 55:08.820\n Should it always come from the designer\n\n55:08.820 --> 55:10.580\n or should there be a marketing person\n\n55:10.580 --> 55:13.660\n that yeah, steps in and ask the question.\n\n55:13.660 --> 55:16.180\n So I'll just keep asking random questions.\n\n55:16.180 --> 55:18.060\n No, these are great questions.\n\n55:18.060 --> 55:20.100\n So, cause you're just like, I'm like,\n\n55:20.100 --> 55:22.220\n I can't wait to tell you the answer.\n\n55:22.220 --> 55:23.780\n So it's in the book as well,\n\n55:23.780 --> 55:25.780\n but you have to separate out\n\n55:25.780 --> 55:27.780\n the various functions of marketing.\n\n55:27.780 --> 55:30.860\n That's what I thought, I was like,\n\n55:30.860 --> 55:34.420\n marketing's marketing, and it's really not.\n\n55:34.420 --> 55:35.620\n There's so many disciplines,\n\n55:35.620 --> 55:38.660\n just like in engineering, mechanical, electrical, software,\n\n55:38.660 --> 55:41.700\n and even software, it's cloud services,\n\n55:41.700 --> 55:43.700\n firmware applications,\n\n55:43.700 --> 55:46.620\n marketing has that much diversity as well.\n\n55:46.620 --> 55:48.900\n Okay, and you have to honor that.\n\n55:48.900 --> 55:53.900\n And so there is marketing communications like PR, press,\n\n55:53.900 --> 55:57.140\n there is social marketing,\n\n55:57.140 --> 56:00.220\n there is a marketing creative, right?\n\n56:00.220 --> 56:01.900\n There's marketing activation,\n\n56:03.300 --> 56:05.740\n but there's another thing that also comes out\n\n56:05.740 --> 56:09.700\n and people confuse it with marketing,\n\n56:09.700 --> 56:13.460\n which is called product marketing or product management.\n\n56:13.460 --> 56:15.820\n And product management or product marketing\n\n56:15.820 --> 56:17.380\n is the voice of the customer.\n\n56:18.780 --> 56:21.860\n They're the person who sits there and listens\n\n56:21.860 --> 56:25.500\n to what's going on in the competition, in the marketplace,\n\n56:25.500 --> 56:28.580\n understanding the needs and those pains of the customer,\n\n56:28.580 --> 56:31.700\n and they're representing them in every single meeting\n\n56:31.700 --> 56:34.900\n so things don't get off track, right?\n\n56:34.900 --> 56:38.380\n So that, and they're creating the messages,\n\n56:38.380 --> 56:39.380\n not the marketing.\n\n56:39.380 --> 56:40.740\n What happens is there's messages\n\n56:40.740 --> 56:41.940\n that product marketing creates,\n\n56:41.940 --> 56:43.340\n like those are the deep messages,\n\n56:43.340 --> 56:48.140\n like we need to save 20% of energy, let's say, right?\n\n56:48.140 --> 56:50.260\n And then marketing turns that into something\n\n56:50.260 --> 56:52.460\n that's with creative and everything\n\n56:52.460 --> 56:53.660\n and brings that message across.\n\n56:53.660 --> 56:54.540\n Maybe it doesn't say that,\n\n56:54.540 --> 56:57.580\n but it comes maybe visually or some other way.\n\n56:57.580 --> 56:59.940\n So product management does that\n\n56:59.940 --> 57:04.940\n and holds that press release along the route\n\n57:04.940 --> 57:07.100\n and making sure that we're tracking.\n\n57:07.100 --> 57:09.620\n And then also marketing is tracking with that press release\n\n57:09.620 --> 57:12.180\n to make sure they're not telling a fictional story, right?\n\n57:12.180 --> 57:15.340\n Because they can also add extra adjectives or something,\n\n57:15.340 --> 57:16.820\n and then the product can't deliver that.\n\n57:16.820 --> 57:18.180\n It's like, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n57:18.180 --> 57:19.020\n Keeps everybody in check.\n\n57:19.020 --> 57:22.060\n It has to be grounded to the press release, to the raws.\n\n57:22.060 --> 57:24.020\n Right, to the customer needs, right?\n\n57:24.020 --> 57:25.900\n Cause they're always representing the customer.\n\n57:25.900 --> 57:28.660\n So you have to have a product manager.\n\n57:28.660 --> 57:30.980\n Typically that's the founder, right?\n\n57:30.980 --> 57:32.180\n In the beginning.\n\n57:32.180 --> 57:36.420\n And then over time you hire a product management team\n\n57:36.420 --> 57:40.180\n to then really watch over this the whole way.\n\n57:40.180 --> 57:42.660\n And they are talking to customer support.\n\n57:42.660 --> 57:45.100\n They're talking to engineering, they're talking to design,\n\n57:45.100 --> 57:47.580\n they're talking to sales and marketing.\n\n57:47.580 --> 57:50.540\n And they are always in the mix.\n\n57:50.540 --> 57:52.540\n And it's the hardest thing to hire for.\n\n57:52.540 --> 57:53.460\n Ooh, yeah.\n\n57:53.460 --> 57:55.620\n So they have this very important job\n\n57:55.620 --> 57:58.940\n of developing and maintaining the why.\n\n57:58.940 --> 57:59.820\n Exactly.\n\n57:59.820 --> 58:01.660\n Why is it the hardest to hire for?\n\n58:01.660 --> 58:03.540\n Because you have to understand,\n\n58:03.540 --> 58:05.120\n first, nobody reports to you.\n\n58:06.500 --> 58:07.340\n You're alone.\n\n58:07.340 --> 58:10.540\n So you're alone and you have to build great ties\n\n58:10.540 --> 58:13.740\n with all of these different functions.\n\n58:13.740 --> 58:15.900\n You have to understand what they do,\n\n58:15.900 --> 58:17.700\n be empathetic with what they do.\n\n58:17.700 --> 58:21.980\n And you have to project the customer's empathy\n\n58:21.980 --> 58:25.340\n or empathy for the customer to them and tell them why\n\n58:25.340 --> 58:28.740\n and why this customer needs this, why this doesn't work.\n\n58:28.740 --> 58:30.260\n And so that they learn more.\n\n58:30.260 --> 58:31.100\n They're not just doing,\n\n58:31.100 --> 58:33.860\n but they learn about the customer's point of view\n\n58:33.860 --> 58:36.340\n and sit in there and stand in their shoes\n\n58:36.340 --> 58:38.140\n to be able to then make better decisions\n\n58:38.140 --> 58:41.120\n on the engineering details or the operational details,\n\n58:41.120 --> 58:42.580\n customer support details.\n\n58:42.580 --> 58:47.260\n So they understand that if they're not the customer\n\n58:47.260 --> 58:48.460\n that it's intended for,\n\n58:48.460 --> 58:51.580\n they start to live through their eyes\n\n58:51.580 --> 58:53.780\n and see through their eyes of that customer\n\n58:53.780 --> 58:55.100\n so they make better decisions.\n\n58:55.100 --> 58:59.460\n And there's probably fascinating, beautiful tensions\n\n58:59.460 --> 59:03.500\n between that and sort of the engineers.\n\n59:03.500 --> 59:04.540\n Oh, that's cool.\n\n59:04.540 --> 59:08.180\n Sort of the developing the what.\n\n59:08.180 --> 59:09.220\n Exactly.\n\n59:09.220 --> 59:11.860\n Which makes it an extra hard job, I'm sure.\n\n59:11.860 --> 59:12.700\n Exactly.\n\n59:12.700 --> 59:15.100\n Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question\n\n59:15.100 --> 59:17.780\n on the one subfield of marketing you mentioned,\n\n59:17.780 --> 59:18.960\n comms and PR.\n\n59:22.700 --> 59:23.540\n How do I ask this?\n\n59:23.540 --> 59:26.160\n I can hear your struggle in your sigh.\n\n59:27.900 --> 59:32.900\n Why or do the comms and PR folks sometimes\n\n59:36.420 --> 59:40.840\n kill the heart and soul of the magic\n\n59:40.840 --> 59:45.100\n that makes a company or is that wrong to say?\n\n59:45.100 --> 59:46.700\n Give me an example.\n\n59:46.700 --> 59:48.980\n I will say the spirit of the example,\n\n59:48.980 --> 59:53.980\n which is it feels like often the jobs of communications\n\n59:55.860 --> 59:57.620\n is to provide caution.\n\n59:58.940 --> 1:00:01.300\n It almost works together with legal to say.\n\n1:00:01.300 --> 1:00:02.140\n A shield.\n\n1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:06.520\n Yeah, we probably should not say this.\n\n1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:09.180\n Let's be careful, let's be careful.\n\n1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:14.180\n Now, that makes sense except in this modern world,\n\n1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:20.900\n authenticity is extremely valuable\n\n1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:24.980\n and revealing the beauty that is in the engineering,\n\n1:00:24.980 --> 1:00:29.920\n the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas,\n\n1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:34.700\n I think requires throwing caution to the wind to some degree.\n\n1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:35.540\n I agree.\n\n1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:40.540\n And I just find that, boy, to push back on myself,\n\n1:00:43.020 --> 1:00:45.420\n I think it's an extremely difficult job\n\n1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:47.500\n because people hold you responsible\n\n1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:51.520\n if you're doing communications when you take risks.\n\n1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:54.820\n And especially when they fail.\n\n1:00:54.820 --> 1:00:57.540\n So it's a difficult job,\n\n1:00:57.540 --> 1:00:59.580\n so I understand why people become cautious,\n\n1:00:59.580 --> 1:01:03.540\n but to me, communications is about taking big risks\n\n1:01:03.540 --> 1:01:06.100\n and throwing caution to the wind at its best\n\n1:01:06.100 --> 1:01:11.100\n because your job is to communicate in the long term,\n\n1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:16.040\n communicate the genius, the joy,\n\n1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:19.740\n the genius of the product.\n\n1:01:19.740 --> 1:01:23.160\n And that sometimes is a tension with caution.\n\n1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:26.420\n Sorry, so because I've gotten the chance\n\n1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:28.620\n to meet a lot of very interesting people\n\n1:01:28.620 --> 1:01:31.300\n and interesting engineering teams and so on,\n\n1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:33.340\n I look at what they're doing\n\n1:01:33.340 --> 1:01:35.780\n and I look at what's being communicated\n\n1:01:35.780 --> 1:01:37.660\n and it's just, there's a mismatch\n\n1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:40.100\n because the communication is a lot more boring.\n\n1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:44.100\n It's like, there's something very like,\n\n1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:45.900\n just straight up boring\n\n1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:49.780\n about the way they're communicating because of caution.\n\n1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:54.700\n Okay, you have just teed me up for another diatribe, okay?\n\n1:01:54.700 --> 1:01:58.100\n I'm gonna get on my podium here.\n\n1:01:58.100 --> 1:01:58.940\n Yes, please.\n\n1:01:58.940 --> 1:02:02.920\n Yeah, it all comes out of the leader.\n\n1:02:04.380 --> 1:02:06.380\n If the leader doesn't know how to storytell\n\n1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:09.740\n or the leader doesn't know how to do bold storytelling,\n\n1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:14.300\n then you get even more conservatism\n\n1:02:14.300 --> 1:02:17.340\n from the PR and communications folks\n\n1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:18.300\n because they're always,\n\n1:02:18.300 --> 1:02:21.500\n so if you have a, not a bold leader,\n\n1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:23.860\n they're always going to be a filter, right?\n\n1:02:23.860 --> 1:02:25.860\n They're always gonna try to smooth things out\n\n1:02:25.860 --> 1:02:27.620\n and take off the rough edges and try,\n\n1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:28.700\n so they're gonna be even more,\n\n1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.500\n if you have a conservative messaging leader,\n\n1:02:31.500 --> 1:02:32.580\n you're gonna have an even more\n\n1:02:32.580 --> 1:02:35.260\n conservative communications department.\n\n1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:36.100\n Why?\n\n1:02:36.100 --> 1:02:37.740\n Because they wanna keep their jobs.\n\n1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:40.100\n Okay, it's really simple.\n\n1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:41.020\n They gotta keep their jobs.\n\n1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:44.420\n If they say one wrong thing, it could be the end of it.\n\n1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:46.760\n So if you have very conservative leader,\n\n1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:48.920\n they're going to be even more conservative.\n\n1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:50.380\n If you have a bold leader,\n\n1:02:50.380 --> 1:02:54.240\n they'll always take a little more conservative bent,\n\n1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:56.420\n but you're still gonna have bold communications.\n\n1:02:56.420 --> 1:02:57.660\n Yeah, that's brilliant.\n\n1:02:57.660 --> 1:03:00.180\n Okay, so it starts with the leader.\n\n1:03:00.180 --> 1:03:02.420\n Now, that said,\n\n1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:08.060\n when you think about the messages\n\n1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:11.240\n and the joy and revealing things, right?\n\n1:03:13.940 --> 1:03:18.560\n Many of these leaders don't tell great stories.\n\n1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.340\n So what we do at FutureShape, our investment firm,\n\n1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:24.320\n is we take those scientists all of,\n\n1:03:24.320 --> 1:03:25.780\n and the great minds and everything,\n\n1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:28.220\n and what do we surround them with?\n\n1:03:28.220 --> 1:03:30.260\n Marketing and communication people\n\n1:03:30.260 --> 1:03:33.940\n and storytellers to give them the confidence\n\n1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:36.020\n to tell a much broader story\n\n1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:39.100\n about the impacts of what they're creating\n\n1:03:39.100 --> 1:03:42.260\n and how big the global change can be\n\n1:03:42.260 --> 1:03:43.700\n with those technologies.\n\n1:03:43.700 --> 1:03:45.340\n Because usually they don't,\n\n1:03:45.340 --> 1:03:47.640\n those leaders who created those technologies,\n\n1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.500\n they don't really know how to communicate really well\n\n1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:52.760\n and they don't feel very comfortable in how they speak.\n\n1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:54.380\n Yeah, so it's interesting\n\n1:03:54.380 --> 1:03:57.820\n because stories, I'm a huge fan of stories.\n\n1:03:57.820 --> 1:03:59.620\n Have you ever read the book, Story?\n\n1:03:59.620 --> 1:04:00.460\n No.\n\n1:04:00.460 --> 1:04:01.280\n By Robert McKee?\n\n1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:02.120\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:02.940\n You should read this.\n\n1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:04.540\n And this is what I read when I was 26.\n\n1:04:05.940 --> 1:04:07.660\n Story by Robert McKee,\n\n1:04:07.660 --> 1:04:12.460\n and it's a book all about the ways to do script writing,\n\n1:04:12.460 --> 1:04:16.660\n the prototypical types of scripts, drama, comedy,\n\n1:04:16.660 --> 1:04:20.540\n and how it's been shown over millennia,\n\n1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:21.700\n how these stories are done.\n\n1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.620\n It's a fascinating thing\n\n1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:26.020\n and it gives you an insight to,\n\n1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:28.700\n and it's written for obviously Hollywood\n\n1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:30.600\n and movies and things like that,\n\n1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:33.880\n but it's incredibly useful for what we do\n\n1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:37.940\n as designers and engineers and technology leaders.\n\n1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:40.260\n There's some aspect in this modern day\n\n1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:42.620\n where this podcast and so on,\n\n1:04:44.340 --> 1:04:47.260\n what I love is the humans behind the story too.\n\n1:04:47.260 --> 1:04:49.560\n So some part of the story is the human beings.\n\n1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:54.380\n So humor, drama,\n\n1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:57.360\n heartbreak, hope.\n\n1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:58.200\n Emotions.\n\n1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.540\n Emotions.\n\n1:04:59.540 --> 1:05:03.080\n That's not just about painting a beautiful story\n\n1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:05.720\n that's flawless, it's...\n\n1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:06.620\n Vulnerability.\n\n1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:07.460\n Yep.\n\n1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:11.600\n It's being a dreamer, like overpromising,\n\n1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:16.240\n and then failing, so changing your mind,\n\n1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:18.520\n realizing sort of just the whole of it.\n\n1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:20.600\n And then also being like,\n\n1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:22.960\n depending of course where your personality is,\n\n1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:26.800\n embracing the full richness and the complexity\n\n1:05:26.800 --> 1:05:28.600\n of the personality of the leader\n\n1:05:28.600 --> 1:05:30.300\n or the different people involved.\n\n1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:31.800\n I mean, that's all part of it.\n\n1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:34.740\n Like you can't just present this beautiful,\n\n1:05:34.740 --> 1:05:37.840\n always pleasant view of a product.\n\n1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:42.840\n There has to be this humanity that's part of it,\n\n1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:45.940\n the full roller coaster of the humanity,\n\n1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:49.120\n which I think has been very difficult for companies\n\n1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:52.440\n to embrace, I'm not sure why.\n\n1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:54.760\n Maybe it's just an old school way of doing things\n\n1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:57.680\n that people think that we present a facade\n\n1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:02.880\n and we generate the story and we tell the story\n\n1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:04.740\n as opposed to sort of...\n\n1:06:04.740 --> 1:06:07.520\n Well, we learn, especially in the technical world,\n\n1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:11.320\n we present the story as it's faster, it's smaller,\n\n1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:14.600\n it's longer battery life, it's bits and numbers\n\n1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:19.600\n and metrics, that resonates sure with other geeks.\n\n1:06:22.360 --> 1:06:26.720\n What resonates with the planet?\n\n1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.520\n It's all emotions, right?\n\n1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:31.200\n And if you can bring a great emotional story,\n\n1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:33.800\n but with a great rational story at the same time,\n\n1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:36.280\n why you should do this, and it's like,\n\n1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:39.540\n oh my God, you bring that superpower, that joy,\n\n1:06:39.540 --> 1:06:41.320\n then it all hangs.\n\n1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:45.040\n And there's personal drama too, like the human.\n\n1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:48.800\n Right, here's the pain I had, remember that thing.\n\n1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:53.800\n And I mean, you're obviously this extremely well known\n\n1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:02.440\n human being that's behind a lot of these great inventions\n\n1:07:02.440 --> 1:07:04.320\n of the technology world, but you're also just\n\n1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:09.320\n a human being, you have clearly a distinct personality\n\n1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.800\n that comes through, like your eyes light up,\n\n1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:13.800\n just the way you communicate, it's you.\n\n1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:18.660\n Some people are more stoic, some people are,\n\n1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:22.980\n like Elon is all over the place, the chaos.\n\n1:07:24.120 --> 1:07:28.200\n Steve Jobs, I mean, it's hard to put into words,\n\n1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:31.320\n I can be poetic and so on, but there's a very distinct,\n\n1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:34.160\n comes on stage, you know, that personality is right there.\n\n1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:37.600\n That's not just the product, that's something else too.\n\n1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:40.160\n And like, you have to reveal that a little bit,\n\n1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.160\n and allow people to reveal that a little bit,\n\n1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.880\n and just let them be themselves.\n\n1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:50.880\n Well, look, why do I think your podcast is so amazing?\n\n1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:53.060\n Because you are yourself.\n\n1:07:53.060 --> 1:07:55.600\n You talk about yourself, you bring your emotions into it,\n\n1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:00.520\n and you don't modulate it, you're you, right?\n\n1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.960\n It comes through, it's true, it feels right.\n\n1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:07.520\n You are you, you dress the way you wanna dress,\n\n1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:09.640\n you say this is me, and this is all of me,\n\n1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:11.560\n and you become vulnerable, right?\n\n1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:14.040\n It's much easier to do a podcast like that\n\n1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:16.200\n than run a very large company,\n\n1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.780\n where a lot of people would feel the pain if you make,\n\n1:08:18.780 --> 1:08:20.800\n if you say something stupid.\n\n1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:25.800\n So it's much more easy to be afraid and be careful.\n\n1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:29.800\n But nevertheless, the same applies.\n\n1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:36.160\n Authenticity and risk taking is the only way, unfortunately,\n\n1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.520\n to be successful in the long term.\n\n1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:42.960\n Let me, just because we're jumping all over the place,\n\n1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.880\n just link on the iPod.\n\n1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.240\n One of the great designs, broadly speaking,\n\n1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:50.840\n in the word design of all time,\n\n1:08:50.840 --> 1:08:53.720\n what does it take to design a great product?\n\n1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.680\n If you look, we can jump around, we can look at Nest,\n\n1:08:56.680 --> 1:08:59.640\n we can look at iPod, we can look at iPhone,\n\n1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:02.600\n and many of the great things you design,\n\n1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:07.600\n but just looking at that one transformational thing,\n\n1:09:08.220 --> 1:09:13.220\n what can you say about what it takes to do a great design?\n\n1:09:13.220 --> 1:09:15.220\n Or maybe what makes a great design?\n\n1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:22.900\n Well, we talked about a painkiller,\n\n1:09:22.900 --> 1:09:24.720\n and we talked about the,\n\n1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:27.820\n we talked about that joy that comes from it.\n\n1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:31.320\n But then there's the behind the scenes,\n\n1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:35.280\n there's the team, there's everyone who brings it to life,\n\n1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:36.840\n brings that story to life.\n\n1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:41.840\n If you have a great story, and you know the why,\n\n1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:43.440\n then you can communicate it\n\n1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:45.840\n to those people who are working on it.\n\n1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:49.040\n And then they bring their own thing into it, right?\n\n1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:51.180\n It becomes emotional for them too.\n\n1:09:51.180 --> 1:09:53.380\n It's not just a job, it's a mission.\n\n1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:58.400\n And so many of the details that are born\n\n1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:02.000\n out of these early prototypes,\n\n1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.840\n these things that you still haven't given full form to,\n\n1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:08.880\n there may be 80% done, or maybe even 60% done,\n\n1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.720\n but you can see enough in there.\n\n1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:12.720\n Then you take those great ideas,\n\n1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.960\n and you give the whys to the team.\n\n1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:18.520\n And so that they feel it, they can understand it,\n\n1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:22.600\n then they bring their best and their ideas to the table,\n\n1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:24.600\n and then you can select from those,\n\n1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:27.680\n and you can then start to, you know,\n\n1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:29.840\n it could be just a pixel change.\n\n1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:32.380\n It could be a slight change on how you do the audio\n\n1:10:32.380 --> 1:10:35.800\n for the feedback, or maybe a curve on the mechanics,\n\n1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:38.160\n or something like that, of how it feels.\n\n1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:39.880\n Because everybody brings themselves\n\n1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:41.680\n trying to feel this thing.\n\n1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:42.680\n They're not just doing something\n\n1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:44.440\n that someone told them to do.\n\n1:10:44.440 --> 1:10:48.160\n If you can instill that mission and that why into that team,\n\n1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:52.480\n it doesn't have to be big, you get, I feel, a 10X.\n\n1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:54.920\n Everyone comes together in a special way,\n\n1:10:54.920 --> 1:10:58.720\n and the magic is created.\n\n1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:00.660\n You put the love into it,\n\n1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:02.640\n the customer feels the love on the other side.\n\n1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:07.640\n So the, making the team,\n\n1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.760\n like taking them in onto the vision, onto the why,\n\n1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:16.160\n now they feel, all the little details we think of,\n\n1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:21.160\n the original iPod, and all the many generations after,\n\n1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:24.360\n all those little details are,\n\n1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.640\n in them is the emotion of the engineers and the designers,\n\n1:11:27.640 --> 1:11:32.640\n that working nights, struggling, this isn't right.\n\n1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.080\n Like you said, changing little pixels here and there,\n\n1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:41.080\n changing the shape of things, changing the feel of things,\n\n1:11:41.480 --> 1:11:46.480\n like the materials, the, I don't know,\n\n1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:48.640\n just everything on the software part of the packaging.\n\n1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:51.480\n Then the words on the packaging.\n\n1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:52.320\n Just everything.\n\n1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:53.840\n The words on the website.\n\n1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:57.200\n And always jumping from the very specific detail problem\n\n1:11:57.200 --> 1:12:00.200\n to the big picture, how the thing feels, the overall.\n\n1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:01.600\n Always jumping back and forth.\n\n1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:02.920\n What does it look like to the customer?\n\n1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:07.680\n How are we gonna implement it in the most efficient way?\n\n1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:10.560\n Because a lot of the stuff you don't know is,\n\n1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:13.600\n some of that stuff is hacked in, maybe hacked in at the end.\n\n1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.040\n It may not be the most beautiful architecture\n\n1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:18.480\n that a geek would look at and go, oh my God,\n\n1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:20.760\n that's so beautiful, because we can look at it\n\n1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:23.480\n and visualize this incredible software stack\n\n1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:24.480\n or hardware stack.\n\n1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.640\n Some of it could just be hacked in.\n\n1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.240\n You make it better over time,\n\n1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:30.560\n but it was that brilliant thing and we gotta get that in,\n\n1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:32.240\n because that's the way you do it now,\n\n1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:34.240\n and we'll make it more efficient later.\n\n1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:38.560\n Maybe this is a good moment to draw a distinction\n\n1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:40.200\n between design and engineering,\n\n1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:42.460\n and does such a distinction even exist?\n\n1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.380\n Are these distinct disciplines or no?\n\n1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:47.840\n I don't think they're distinct.\n\n1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:49.960\n I think they're different types of design.\n\n1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:54.960\n I think there's always this idea of this,\n\n1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:58.380\n oh, on the mount, designer, and it all comes down\n\n1:12:58.380 --> 1:13:00.700\n and it all flows down like some magic.\n\n1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:05.320\n There are electrical designers, there's AI designers,\n\n1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:07.720\n there is data scientist designers.\n\n1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.580\n Everybody has design, and there's a chapter in the book\n\n1:13:10.580 --> 1:13:12.420\n all about that, actually.\n\n1:13:12.420 --> 1:13:15.000\n That it's not just you go to the mount\n\n1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.480\n and it comes down and you're enlightened.\n\n1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.720\n It's each person brings their form of design\n\n1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:24.100\n and their craft, because if they're really good,\n\n1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:25.440\n they're artists in their own right.\n\n1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:27.640\n They're not just engineers, they're not just designers,\n\n1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.540\n they're artists, they're empathetic,\n\n1:13:29.540 --> 1:13:30.900\n they really wanna bring their best.\n\n1:13:30.900 --> 1:13:32.460\n A lot of the best engineers I have\n\n1:13:32.460 --> 1:13:34.740\n are not the technical, or that I've worked with,\n\n1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:38.160\n are not the technical gotta get it exactly right.\n\n1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:39.800\n They're the artists, they came from music\n\n1:13:39.800 --> 1:13:43.360\n or they came from other things, and they see that.\n\n1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:46.960\n When you work with very rigid engineers,\n\n1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:49.400\n this is the way, the only way, la la la,\n\n1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:52.360\n those are not the engineers I wanna work with.\n\n1:13:52.360 --> 1:13:54.720\n They're all like a bit artists at heart.\n\n1:13:54.720 --> 1:13:59.000\n Right, they understand the practicalness.\n\n1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.220\n They don't have to have the rigidity of,\n\n1:14:01.220 --> 1:14:03.620\n this is the way it's done.\n\n1:14:03.620 --> 1:14:05.120\n Like, mm mm.\n\n1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:07.160\n If you're building something new,\n\n1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:10.400\n all new and revolutionary, none of us are experts at it.\n\n1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.360\n And if you come with that expert mindset, just tell me,\n\n1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:15.360\n and I can give you a story,\n\n1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:17.200\n I should probably give you that story,\n\n1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:21.160\n about that if you come with the expert and I'm the expert,\n\n1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:23.760\n when you're doing something no one's ever done before,\n\n1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:25.480\n I don't want you on the team.\n\n1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.640\n Because we all are learning about something\n\n1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:30.800\n that has never been in existence before.\n\n1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:33.480\n And we have to bring that level of vulnerability\n\n1:14:33.480 --> 1:14:37.640\n and openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things\n\n1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.480\n throughout the team.\n\n1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:42.880\n So you want people that are able to have like\n\n1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:46.400\n beginner's mind or whatever, like don't come in as an expert.\n\n1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:47.320\n What's the story?\n\n1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.680\n Okay, here's the story.\n\n1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:50.880\n No, I can tell it for sure.\n\n1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:54.880\n So, you know, you asked what were these risks,\n\n1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.520\n you know, like on the early iPod,\n\n1:14:56.520 --> 1:14:58.680\n and there was a few big risks.\n\n1:14:58.680 --> 1:15:00.880\n Like one, and this doesn't go in the story,\n\n1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.920\n but like putting rotating media in your pocket\n\n1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:06.120\n and it could drop at any time,\n\n1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:07.040\n what happens there?\n\n1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:08.000\n And like you can damage,\n\n1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000\n because the heads and the hard drive media are so close,\n\n1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.240\n it smacks, it's dead, right?\n\n1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.640\n So that was one big one, like, holy shit, right?\n\n1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:17.480\n So that was something we,\n\n1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.320\n and we had to design special tests and everything\n\n1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.040\n and special software on that.\n\n1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:22.000\n But then there was another one,\n\n1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.560\n which was at the early days,\n\n1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:26.760\n the way the first generations of iPods,\n\n1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:31.760\n I had to hack the IDE interface to the hard drives.\n\n1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:34.320\n So I was like, okay, what we're gonna use\n\n1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:36.920\n is we're gonna use this chip for hard drive,\n\n1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:40.160\n hard drive, to make a hard drive,\n\n1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:43.520\n you had to have a chip that did FireWire to a hard drive.\n\n1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:46.760\n Okay, and then that would become a portable hard drive.\n\n1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:50.680\n Well, then we had the MP3 player\n\n1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:52.360\n and the user interface and everything.\n\n1:15:52.360 --> 1:15:54.480\n So there was times when it was just this hard drive\n\n1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.440\n and there was times when it was a MP3 player\n\n1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:00.640\n and I had to hot switch between\n\n1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:03.920\n what the hard drive thinks it was talking to, right?\n\n1:16:03.920 --> 1:16:05.800\n So designed this thing, tore it apart,\n\n1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:06.640\n did all this stuff.\n\n1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.520\n And I was like, you know,\n\n1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:10.880\n maybe I'm gonna screw up IDE and there's something,\n\n1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:13.040\n there's some holes I'm gonna see.\n\n1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:15.400\n So I go, who's the expert at Apple\n\n1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:18.400\n who understands IDE and everything?\n\n1:16:18.400 --> 1:16:21.160\n So this person comes over,\n\n1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.440\n the mass storage specialist comes over\n\n1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:24.960\n and I put on the whiteboard and say,\n\n1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:25.880\n here's how we're gonna do this thing\n\n1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:27.040\n and here's the commands and da da,\n\n1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:28.440\n and this is how it hot switches and everything.\n\n1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:30.680\n He's like, that's never gonna work.\n\n1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:31.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:32.960\n And I was like, what?\n\n1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:33.880\n It was never gonna work.\n\n1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:35.120\n I said, well, let me go over here\n\n1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:36.240\n and show you this right here.\n\n1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.760\n I have it prototyped and it's been working for days.\n\n1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:40.120\n I just wanna see if you're gonna have it,\n\n1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:41.960\n find any holes in the thing.\n\n1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:44.280\n Didn't even, and he just stormed out of the room\n\n1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:46.800\n and never even, right?\n\n1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:47.840\n That's hilarious.\n\n1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:50.760\n I've had a lot of experience like this with experts.\n\n1:16:50.760 --> 1:16:53.240\n Like for example, this ridiculous room.\n\n1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:59.200\n I had a person and there's many people like this\n\n1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:03.200\n that I showed them, here's the situation, you know.\n\n1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.040\n For acoustics or something?\n\n1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:04.960\n For acoustics, yeah.\n\n1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:07.960\n They're like, no, no, no, no, this is horrible.\n\n1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:11.720\n This is not, this is not gonna work.\n\n1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:15.840\n The reflection, the curtains are not gonna stop.\n\n1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:19.440\n There's a bunch of terminology they're telling me.\n\n1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:22.000\n It's a similar kind of situation as the ID,\n\n1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.400\n which I was like, no, listen,\n\n1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:27.640\n I just need to see is there major issues\n\n1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:30.200\n and they're like a low hanging fruit that are fixable\n\n1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:32.120\n and major holes I should be aware of.\n\n1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:33.640\n Not like, let's.\n\n1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:35.520\n $100,000 to upgrade.\n\n1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.320\n To upgrade for what exact purpose?\n\n1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:39.360\n What, not why?\n\n1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:40.880\n Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.680\n The why, the focusing on the story, on the content,\n\n1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:46.760\n on the, the why, the why, the why.\n\n1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:49.880\n And that actually I've experienced that unfortunately\n\n1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:53.560\n in the artistic realms too, which is like photography\n\n1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:56.320\n and videography, cinematography.\n\n1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:58.640\n It's interesting, I talk to photographers\n\n1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:01.000\n that are quote unquote experts.\n\n1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.360\n And it's always about so much of the focus\n\n1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:08.040\n is on the equipment.\n\n1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:12.520\n The equipment behind the sensors and the lighting.\n\n1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.280\n And it's like, all right, all right.\n\n1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:21.200\n But what about, what about the feeling\n\n1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:26.120\n of the story you create visually?\n\n1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:30.920\n The difference between a movie that's really well told\n\n1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:33.040\n and it doesn't have all the effects and everything\n\n1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:35.200\n versus maybe some of the superhero movies\n\n1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:38.160\n we see all the time, which is good luck if there's a story\n\n1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:41.680\n but man, there's a lot of action and CGI, right?\n\n1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:42.520\n That's right.\n\n1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:46.160\n And there's also value to those, right?\n\n1:18:46.160 --> 1:18:48.240\n CGI, superhero.\n\n1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:49.640\n Can tell a better story\n\n1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:51.840\n but you have to have a good story to begin with.\n\n1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:53.040\n Sure, exactly.\n\n1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:55.560\n But if you're focused on the story,\n\n1:18:55.560 --> 1:18:57.360\n I guess you need to start with a story.\n\n1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:58.840\n You need to start with a story.\n\n1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:01.560\n And if you bring in experts,\n\n1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:06.560\n they can often be detrimental, I guess, to the why.\n\n1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:09.080\n They're too good at doing the what.\n\n1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:11.560\n Well, you can bring in experts for why.\n\n1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.840\n There's lots of experts for why.\n\n1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:16.480\n Too many times we get experts for what.\n\n1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:17.320\n Yes.\n\n1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:19.200\n And then they only focus on the what.\n\n1:19:19.200 --> 1:19:21.680\n And so they come with the specs and feeds\n\n1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:24.120\n and the numbers and all the other stuff.\n\n1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:25.960\n But what you're really asking for is I need somebody\n\n1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:27.320\n about the why and understanding\n\n1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:29.320\n what we're trying to get done here\n\n1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:32.560\n and fitting the what's into that why, right?\n\n1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:37.560\n That's why I do think that one of the qualities\n\n1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:39.800\n that I really enjoy for people to work with\n\n1:19:39.800 --> 1:19:41.880\n is like humility for a particular problem\n\n1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.120\n when you approach it.\n\n1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:45.560\n Basically, I don't know how to solve this\n\n1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:47.320\n but we're going to figure it out.\n\n1:19:47.320 --> 1:19:51.040\n As opposed to, oh, I've solved this thing many, many times\n\n1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:53.480\n before I know exactly what to do.\n\n1:19:53.480 --> 1:19:55.760\n Humility before the chaos.\n\n1:19:55.760 --> 1:19:59.240\n So having an open mind that this is going to require\n\n1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:01.760\n a totally new way of doing things.\n\n1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.600\n It's a really nice quality to see.\n\n1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:07.320\n You're one of the fascinating humans\n\n1:20:07.320 --> 1:20:09.600\n in the history of Silicon Valley.\n\n1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:11.400\n Steve is another one of those.\n\n1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:13.840\n So those two humans came together for a time\n\n1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:15.200\n to work together.\n\n1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:18.840\n What was it like working with Steve Jobs?\n\n1:20:18.840 --> 1:20:22.480\n What aspect of his behavior and personality,\n\n1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:25.800\n let's say, brought out the best in you?\n\n1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:28.560\n Pushing you, really pushing you,\n\n1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:30.560\n relentless on the details,\n\n1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:33.840\n challenging you for the right reasons.\n\n1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.360\n It wasn't bullying, it wasn't demeaning.\n\n1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:39.080\n He would critique the work, not judge the person,\n\n1:20:39.080 --> 1:20:41.320\n at least not in front of them.\n\n1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:43.400\n Or inside of a, you know, in front of a group\n\n1:20:43.400 --> 1:20:44.800\n or anything like that.\n\n1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:46.840\n I know it was really that attention to detail.\n\n1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:50.280\n And he, when he would make a decision, you know,\n\n1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:52.680\n there are, when you make the first version of anything,\n\n1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:53.880\n something revolutionary,\n\n1:20:53.880 --> 1:20:56.480\n there are a lot of opinion based decisions.\n\n1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:59.160\n And there's only one or two people, three people\n\n1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:01.560\n who hold those opinion based decisions\n\n1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.000\n and what they should be.\n\n1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.520\n And when you have those opinions\n\n1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:09.840\n and you're trying to work with the team\n\n1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:13.680\n to implement those decisions,\n\n1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:16.840\n you have to really tell the why of those decisions.\n\n1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:19.840\n Just don't go do it, but why it's there.\n\n1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:23.720\n So you can feel part of that decision.\n\n1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:27.000\n You can understand what were the trade offs\n\n1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:31.080\n of the different other answers to that opinion, right?\n\n1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:35.200\n And say, this is the reason why we picked the route we picked\n\n1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:36.640\n because it's this for the customer\n\n1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:38.760\n or this for the whole world story, what have you.\n\n1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:40.920\n So that you felt really good\n\n1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:42.600\n because a lot of times most people\n\n1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:44.280\n want a data driven decision,\n\n1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:48.080\n but with the ones you don't get data, right?\n\n1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:50.000\n Maybe in a B2B, you could a little bit\n\n1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.280\n cause you can talk to customers,\n\n1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:52.960\n but you can't do that with a consumer product.\n\n1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:57.080\n V1, version one, B2B, business to business\n\n1:21:57.080 --> 1:21:59.280\n versus what's the alternative?\n\n1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:01.160\n Business to consumer, V1.\n\n1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:03.800\n Okay, we're just defining some terms.\n\n1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:06.360\n Yes, you're absolutely.\n\n1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:09.720\n And when you say data driven decisions versus what?\n\n1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:11.200\n Opinion based decisions.\n\n1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:14.280\n So like gut, you have to use, you don't have any.\n\n1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:19.280\n You can't fall back on any data or any previous history\n\n1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:23.040\n to kind of inform you of what's going on, right?\n\n1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:27.720\n And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed\n\n1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:31.760\n and cannot make new innovations and new products,\n\n1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:33.520\n it's because they're trying to turn,\n\n1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.040\n and this is what I saw at Phillips,\n\n1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:37.320\n they're trying to turn opinion based decisions\n\n1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:40.720\n into data driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs.\n\n1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:43.920\n So if you look at management consulting,\n\n1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:46.160\n management consulting is all about\n\n1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:48.440\n taking those opinion based decisions,\n\n1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:50.960\n giving them to someone else to turn into data\n\n1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.840\n that comes back to them and says,\n\n1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.640\n they can blame the management consultants\n\n1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:57.120\n when something goes wrong,\n\n1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:01.080\n as opposed to it wasn't me, right?\n\n1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:03.120\n When you need to have to tell that story,\n\n1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:06.040\n you have to understand that, especially V1,\n\n1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:09.640\n you need to be able to articulate\n\n1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:14.200\n those opinion based decisions and you need to own them.\n\n1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:17.440\n And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right,\n\n1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:21.840\n you then own them and fix them and move on, right?\n\n1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:23.920\n Version one of the iPod wasn't perfect.\n\n1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:25.880\n Version one of the iPhone wasn't perfect.\n\n1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:28.280\n We got a lot of opinion based decisions wrong.\n\n1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:31.920\n But as you go through that, because you got more data,\n\n1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:34.880\n because V2, you had data on those original opinions\n\n1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:37.400\n and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right?\n\n1:23:37.400 --> 1:23:38.720\n And you'll still have new opinions\n\n1:23:38.720 --> 1:23:40.520\n because those are differentiators\n\n1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:42.520\n that we call differentiators,\n\n1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:47.520\n the things that move the product forward in its evolution.\n\n1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:49.800\n But at the revolution stage,\n\n1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:52.520\n opinions, opinions, opinions, no data.\n\n1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:55.560\n And so you have this discussion, you and Steve\n\n1:23:55.560 --> 1:24:00.560\n in the stage and the whole team with opinions.\n\n1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.280\n And there you have to be harsh.\n\n1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:08.120\n And I wouldn't say harsh,\n\n1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:10.320\n but you have to be very determined, right?\n\n1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:13.240\n You know, there are two real opinion based decisions\n\n1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:15.280\n that happened on the iPhone.\n\n1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:18.000\n One was the keyboard.\n\n1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:19.720\n Should we have a hardboard keyboard\n\n1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:21.400\n or should we have a virtual keyboard?\n\n1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:23.640\n The Blackberry was the number one\n\n1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:26.840\n productivity messaging device of its time.\n\n1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:29.200\n It was called a Crackberry for a reason\n\n1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:31.920\n because people loved it because it was easy to type\n\n1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:34.840\n and they could get their work done.\n\n1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:36.840\n But when you're saying we're gonna move from that,\n\n1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:38.680\n everyone's talking about that in the market\n\n1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:41.280\n and you say we're gonna move to a virtual keyboard\n\n1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:44.720\n and it's not gonna work as well as the hardware keyboard,\n\n1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:46.880\n that's an opinion based decision, right?\n\n1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:48.400\n Because the data is telling you\n\n1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:51.360\n all the best sales are over here.\n\n1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:53.120\n God, that takes guts.\n\n1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:54.720\n It takes guts, but you have to look at it\n\n1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:56.160\n from a different point of view.\n\n1:24:56.160 --> 1:24:59.320\n And this is how I learned to come to understand this\n\n1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.360\n because I had been building virtual keyboards before\n\n1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:06.520\n and I knew the goodness and the badness in them, right?\n\n1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:09.160\n But he was like, look, those are productivity devices.\n\n1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:12.840\n We're making it, ours is born out of an entertainment device\n\n1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:14.840\n and productivity, right?\n\n1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:16.960\n We need to show full screen videos.\n\n1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:19.960\n We are gonna have apps, not apps, but our apps,\n\n1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:22.320\n the Apple apps, cause there were no app store yet,\n\n1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:23.440\n are gonna take over the whole screen.\n\n1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.440\n You want a full screen web browser.\n\n1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:27.600\n You don't want one that's like half of the device\n\n1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:28.520\n is just a keyboard.\n\n1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:30.520\n Maybe you don't need that keyboard in every instance.\n\n1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:32.360\n So we want that part of the screen to change\n\n1:25:32.360 --> 1:25:34.680\n based on the tool you may need at the time.\n\n1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:36.880\n And maybe it's just full view, right?\n\n1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:38.080\n So you have to go and understand\n\n1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:39.360\n it's a different type of device,\n\n1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:42.200\n just cause that's that and it's successful for that reason,\n\n1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:43.880\n the crackberry for the keyboard.\n\n1:25:43.880 --> 1:25:46.080\n That's not the only thing you're gonna do with this device\n\n1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:47.920\n cause people only did messaging\n\n1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:49.720\n and maybe a few phone calls, right?\n\n1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:50.880\n This was gonna be so much more.\n\n1:25:50.880 --> 1:25:53.400\n It was gonna be an entertainment web browsing device.\n\n1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:55.560\n So you wanted those tools to go away,\n\n1:25:55.560 --> 1:25:58.760\n but it wouldn't be as good as the hardware keyboard.\n\n1:25:58.760 --> 1:25:59.680\n So that's an opinion.\n\n1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:01.840\n But let me give you another opinion based decision\n\n1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.840\n that got turned around before it shipped.\n\n1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:07.240\n Steve said, no SIM slot.\n\n1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:08.440\n I don't want any slots.\n\n1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:10.400\n We're gonna make it very pure.\n\n1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:12.200\n Johnny was like, of course, no slots.\n\n1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:13.960\n Johnny, hi.\n\n1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:18.600\n And we all looked around and go, that doesn't work.\n\n1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:19.440\n You can't do that.\n\n1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:20.280\n Well, why does Varite?\n\n1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:22.440\n And then he would always, and this was the magic of Steve,\n\n1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:24.040\n like when you said, no, that doesn't work,\n\n1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:27.520\n you'd go, well, why does Verizon not have any SIM slots?\n\n1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:29.280\n They showed that you can do a mobile phone\n\n1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:30.120\n with no SIM slots.\n\n1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:32.360\n And you're like, okay, here we go.\n\n1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:35.680\n And so a few days later, we come back with,\n\n1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:40.080\n so product marketing, voice of the customer, engineering,\n\n1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:41.480\n we all come back with all the data\n\n1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:46.200\n showing how many data networks and mobile networks\n\n1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:50.560\n required SIM cards versus did not and what the trends were.\n\n1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:54.800\n And so we showed the data and that killed the,\n\n1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:56.960\n or excuse me, brought back the SIM slot\n\n1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:58.440\n on the original iPhone.\n\n1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:01.320\n Because we're like, because he was just like,\n\n1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:04.400\n we're gonna tell AT&T to not use a SIM, right?\n\n1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:06.880\n We're gonna just tell them to do it differently, right?\n\n1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:07.720\n But we were like,\n\n1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:09.560\n if we want this thing to go anywhere around the world,\n\n1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:11.240\n you wanna put that friction in.\n\n1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:13.120\n People are gonna move from place to place.\n\n1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.440\n They have different SIMs\n\n1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:16.080\n because of the prices and all that stuff.\n\n1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:17.800\n We had to show all of that data.\n\n1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:20.960\n And then that opinion based decision got turned\n\n1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:22.800\n into a data driven decision.\n\n1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:25.480\n And the SIM slot obviously showed up.\n\n1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:28.920\n So those are two very, at the very same time, right?\n\n1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:33.640\n Opinion can hold and so can data overrule opinion\n\n1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:36.120\n when data does exist for a V1.\n\n1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:37.600\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:40.480\n you don't know what the right answer is.\n\n1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:45.480\n So doing no SIM card slot\n\n1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.720\n may have been the right decision.\n\n1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:49.240\n We won't know.\n\n1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:53.520\n Because maybe if that was the decision,\n\n1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.120\n then like many times throughout Apple's history,\n\n1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:01.280\n you basically changed the tide of how technology is done.\n\n1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:03.520\n Absolutely, you never know.\n\n1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:05.160\n Apple started WiFi.\n\n1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:06.840\n People don't understand WiFi came out of there.\n\n1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:08.760\n There was no WiFi in 2001.\n\n1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:10.360\n Apple started WiFi.\n\n1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:13.520\n And then everyone else got on board.\n\n1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:15.160\n If you look at now where we're going,\n\n1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.560\n we're going to phones without SIM slots.\n\n1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:18.880\n Cause we have eSIMs, right?\n\n1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:21.320\n And now the SIM slots becoming legacy, legacy.\n\n1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:23.040\n It's a legacy port.\n\n1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:24.720\n That legacy port will probably be gone\n\n1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:28.480\n by six, maybe 10 years.\n\n1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:29.480\n It'll be gone.\n\n1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:31.400\n I'm pretty sure of that.\n\n1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:32.640\n Because it's so much easier for carriers.\n\n1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:35.880\n They don't have to have physical things to go out and right.\n\n1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:38.640\n So right now it's just the early days,\n\n1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:41.080\n but it will happen and it will go its way.\n\n1:28:41.080 --> 1:28:43.120\n It'll fall away, but it will take time.\n\n1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:44.920\n You just couldn't do it back then.\n\n1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:47.960\n So timing is essential here, but at the end of the day,\n\n1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:49.920\n it's opinions and that's where the genius is.\n\n1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:52.080\n Sometimes the data tells you one thing,\n\n1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:55.880\n but the data at the end of the day does represent the past.\n\n1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:56.720\n Exactly.\n\n1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:59.040\n And the future may be different than the past.\n\n1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:00.560\n Right.\n\n1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:03.560\n Sometimes there's wisdom in the past\n\n1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:06.600\n and sometimes it's actually representative\n\n1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:09.120\n of something that should be overcome\n\n1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:12.400\n and progress looks like leaving that stuff behind.\n\n1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:15.400\n Like the headphone jack.\n\n1:29:15.400 --> 1:29:16.560\n Right.\n\n1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:20.160\n I mean that when different folks were getting rid\n\n1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:25.160\n of the headphone jack, boy, I would love to be a fly\n\n1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:27.960\n in the wall of those discussions.\n\n1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:31.600\n We had that, oh, that was a discussion\n\n1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:34.280\n that happened almost every year.\n\n1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:35.400\n That was an every year,\n\n1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:38.760\n should we get rid of headphone jacks on the iPod, right?\n\n1:29:38.760 --> 1:29:41.360\n When are wireless headsets gonna happen, right?\n\n1:29:41.360 --> 1:29:44.480\n And it took years to build all the right protocols,\n\n1:29:44.480 --> 1:29:47.240\n the chips, all those things to make the experience\n\n1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:50.880\n that is the iPods today, right?\n\n1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:52.480\n To say, have the confidence,\n\n1:29:52.480 --> 1:29:55.640\n cause Bluetooth was good, but it wasn't Apple like.\n\n1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.440\n So that is like, we gotta make our own chips,\n\n1:29:57.440 --> 1:29:59.000\n we gotta make our own software stacks.\n\n1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.920\n Now we have the confidence to remove the headphone jack\n\n1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.840\n and actually make you pay $200 more for your iPhone\n\n1:30:04.840 --> 1:30:07.320\n that you were just paying because of the headphone jack.\n\n1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:09.200\n Now we've grown our revenue,\n\n1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:11.880\n we've given a new experience to the user, right?\n\n1:30:11.880 --> 1:30:15.640\n And ta da, you know, and it's just, it's magic.\n\n1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:17.960\n And now the world's transformed to everyone,\n\n1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:19.920\n you know, moving to that, right?\n\n1:30:19.920 --> 1:30:22.840\n But it took years to understand the problem,\n\n1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:26.720\n develop the technology and not just rush it to market\n\n1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:28.880\n to get a half experience, but to get it right\n\n1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:31.000\n and refine it, then ship it.\n\n1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:33.240\n And only then after it was probably four\n\n1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:34.800\n or five years in development,\n\n1:30:34.800 --> 1:30:37.960\n just like the M1 processor, right?\n\n1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:42.040\n That was a work from 2008, right?\n\n1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:45.320\n Grinding away, grinding away, grinding away,\n\n1:30:45.320 --> 1:30:47.040\n then saying, okay, now we have the confidence\n\n1:30:47.040 --> 1:30:49.600\n we're doing our own silicon for all the iPhones\n\n1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.600\n and iPads and such.\n\n1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:56.120\n Now we're gonna turn to the Mac\n\n1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:58.200\n and make sure we have the best processor, right?\n\n1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:01.600\n Not just that we have the best integrated design team.\n\n1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:03.600\n And then saying we're gonna, you know,\n\n1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:06.960\n and then besting everyone, making sure the softwares\n\n1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:09.440\n and the hardware is designed at the same time,\n\n1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:11.120\n making sure the kernels, all those things\n\n1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:16.120\n are gonna use the best efficiency and then popping it out.\n\n1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:18.560\n And then it feels seamless.\n\n1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:19.400\n It's magic.\n\n1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:21.920\n There were no, as far as I could tell,\n\n1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:23.680\n unless you were in real esoteric drivers\n\n1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:25.960\n or something like that, it just worked.\n\n1:31:25.960 --> 1:31:27.080\n It was magic.\n\n1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:29.520\n Like the transition, it was not even a speed bump.\n\n1:31:29.520 --> 1:31:32.200\n It was not even a crack in the road.\n\n1:31:32.200 --> 1:31:36.480\n So perhaps famously Steve had a bit of a temper.\n\n1:31:36.480 --> 1:31:41.480\n Steve Jobs, would you say his particular personality\n\n1:31:41.480 --> 1:31:46.120\n in this aspect was constructive or destructive\n\n1:31:46.120 --> 1:31:51.120\n in the process of shaping these opinion based ideas?\n\n1:31:55.360 --> 1:32:00.360\n So in Build, I write a chapter called Assholes.\n\n1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:05.840\n Yes, and you lay out beautifully the types of assholes\n\n1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:09.480\n and maybe you could speak to the constructive\n\n1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:12.480\n and the destructive types of assholes.\n\n1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:18.600\n So there's really two delineations that I've found\n\n1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:20.600\n of real fundamental ones.\n\n1:32:20.600 --> 1:32:23.320\n And that is again, the why.\n\n1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:26.760\n Why do I feel this person is an asshole?\n\n1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:28.880\n They might not be.\n\n1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:32.640\n I feel this is a person who's an asshole.\n\n1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:34.720\n Are they motivated by their ego\n\n1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:38.280\n or are they motivated by their mission?\n\n1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:39.640\n Something they're trying to do\n\n1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:43.200\n and doing in service of something else, right?\n\n1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:44.800\n Sometimes those lines can be blurry,\n\n1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:46.560\n but it's usually pretty clear.\n\n1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:52.960\n When it's ego motivated, it's clear they're just trying\n\n1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:55.760\n to get up in the ranks, push people down,\n\n1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.400\n shove people aside.\n\n1:32:57.400 --> 1:33:00.560\n I think we saw a president do that on a stage once.\n\n1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:05.560\n I'm me and I'm the guy, right?\n\n1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:09.280\n And I'm gonna prove it by pushing everyone away\n\n1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:11.640\n and being nefarious or what have you.\n\n1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:15.440\n Either passively aggressive or aggressively aggressive,\n\n1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:18.360\n but they're doing about themselves.\n\n1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:21.760\n There's another one, which is someone who's so attentive\n\n1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:26.480\n to detail and unrelenting that they're trying to get\n\n1:33:26.480 --> 1:33:28.600\n the right things for the country.\n\n1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:31.960\n They're trying to get the right things for the customer\n\n1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:33.920\n or in service of their mission.\n\n1:33:33.920 --> 1:33:37.920\n And they wanna make sure we fulfill those things, right?\n\n1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:39.280\n And they really care.\n\n1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:41.480\n They don't micromanage all the details,\n\n1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:44.480\n but they micromanage the details where the customer,\n\n1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:46.280\n it touches the customer in some way.\n\n1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:51.240\n People who work with those types of people\n\n1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:55.040\n who are unrelenting and push you and might make you upset.\n\n1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:58.200\n A lot of times it's a knee jerk reaction to go,\n\n1:33:58.200 --> 1:33:59.400\n they are an asshole.\n\n1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:05.800\n Get off my back, you're an ass, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:09.320\n Right, and you're protecting your ego\n\n1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:11.160\n because what's happening is that person\n\n1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.800\n is usually pushing you beyond your boundaries.\n\n1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:18.360\n They see something that we can do or you can do\n\n1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:20.600\n that you're just either not wanting to do\n\n1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:23.600\n for whatever reason, you're not confident in that.\n\n1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:26.240\n You're like, I don't wanna take the extra time\n\n1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:28.880\n and saying, no, we need to get that done and pushing you.\n\n1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:33.880\n Okay, and so when we came to those areas,\n\n1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.880\n it wasn't just a one on one,\n\n1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:39.000\n it could be Steve against the team going,\n\n1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.320\n we need glass instead of plastic\n\n1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:43.120\n on the front face of the iPhone,\n\n1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:45.480\n and we're going to do this.\n\n1:34:45.480 --> 1:34:49.520\n And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.\n\n1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:52.520\n And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details,\n\n1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:55.000\n but he could see in our minds that we're like,\n\n1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.560\n yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,\n\n1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:59.600\n but man, it's really putting us in risk.\n\n1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:01.560\n And we laid out the risks for him.\n\n1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:03.640\n And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.\n\n1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:04.480\n We'll do that.\n\n1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.480\n We're like, we might be three months late.\n\n1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:08.480\n He's like, this is so important.\n\n1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:09.840\n We need to stay on time.\n\n1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:14.840\n You know, but it would be all the time, push, push, push.\n\n1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:18.280\n It reminds me of like kids growing up and me as growing up,\n\n1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:20.760\n you know, when your parents push you\n\n1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.760\n to make you grow beyond your boundaries,\n\n1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:23.720\n your personal boundaries.\n\n1:35:23.720 --> 1:35:27.360\n And you're like, God damn it, I'm so, you know,\n\n1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:28.600\n but they do it for the right reasons.\n\n1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:30.960\n Now let's see, it's not bullying.\n\n1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:31.880\n It's not about bullying.\n\n1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:33.480\n It's not about demeaning.\n\n1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:36.680\n It's about either pushing you to another part of the mission\n\n1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:39.560\n that needs to get done, or it's about critiquing your work,\n\n1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:40.960\n but not judging you.\n\n1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:41.800\n Yes.\n\n1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:43.800\n Well, there's a lot to say there.\n\n1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:46.680\n So one, it's fascinating.\n\n1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:48.120\n It really is fascinating.\n\n1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:49.880\n And you laid out a very nice picture,\n\n1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:54.880\n but it does feel like there's sometimes gray areas,\n\n1:35:55.080 --> 1:35:57.120\n which is why it makes all of this very complicated.\n\n1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.480\n So one question I have for you\n\n1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:00.720\n in terms of glass on the iPhone.\n\n1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:08.040\n How important is it that like Steve in that case is right?\n\n1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:12.640\n Because I could argue each side.\n\n1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:14.840\n It seems like in one sense,\n\n1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:18.160\n just having a strong vision and opinion\n\n1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:20.760\n is already going to make everybody grow,\n\n1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:22.920\n even if it turns out to be the wrong.\n\n1:36:22.920 --> 1:36:25.840\n As long as you are sort of standing your ground,\n\n1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:30.680\n you know, Napoleon invading Russia or something\n\n1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:35.360\n in the winter, like it's just not gonna be a good idea.\n\n1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.080\n It's not a good idea, but I'm gonna hold to that.\n\n1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:41.680\n And then once you decide, you go all in.\n\n1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:44.080\n And then from that, even if the whole team knows\n\n1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.840\n it's the wrong decision, just sticking by it,\n\n1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:50.040\n powering through, you will learn through the pain of it.\n\n1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:51.520\n Like everybody will learn.\n\n1:36:51.520 --> 1:36:53.000\n So that's one side.\n\n1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.000\n The other is maybe the asshole, the vision driven asshole\n\n1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:02.600\n gets to be more and more of an asshole\n\n1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.800\n if they have a track record of through that process,\n\n1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:10.480\n having built people up, having made the correct decisions.\n\n1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:13.000\n They can't, they're not allowed to be an asshole.\n\n1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.120\n They're in rare air and no one can challenge them.\n\n1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:16.560\n Right, right.\n\n1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:18.680\n Steve was never that.\n\n1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:19.760\n That's the great thing.\n\n1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:22.680\n He was never unchallengeable.\n\n1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:23.520\n You could challenge him.\n\n1:37:23.520 --> 1:37:28.520\n Now the plastic to glass story is a perfect example of this.\n\n1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:33.160\n So at the beginning of the project,\n\n1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:35.080\n well before we were going,\n\n1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:38.680\n we had always had these things about plastic front iPods,\n\n1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:41.320\n these kinds of things, scratches and all that stuff.\n\n1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:46.320\n So we said, oh, we're gonna have a glass or a plastic,\n\n1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:47.800\n a cover for the display.\n\n1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:50.200\n Cause the display was glass underneath it.\n\n1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:54.720\n We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic.\n\n1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:58.320\n And then we all landed together on plastic.\n\n1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:03.240\n Okay, the original decision was plastic.\n\n1:38:03.240 --> 1:38:06.320\n And the reasons were, okay, we don't wanna make a mistake.\n\n1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:08.960\n Glass can break, you know,\n\n1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:11.400\n people drop them all the time.\n\n1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:14.200\n So we don't wanna have a fragile device\n\n1:38:14.200 --> 1:38:17.120\n because you're gonna be using even more\n\n1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:19.520\n than a music player, right?\n\n1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:21.760\n And you're gonna be holding your head\n\n1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:24.880\n and putting it in your pocket and misses and all that stuff.\n\n1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:27.320\n So we went down the road with plastic.\n\n1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:30.720\n When it was shown, when the product was shown\n\n1:38:30.720 --> 1:38:35.720\n at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that was plastic.\n\n1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:39.640\n We had just enough of them in the field at the time.\n\n1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:43.640\n We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic.\n\n1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:48.120\n Reviewers who didn't have the device yet,\n\n1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:49.560\n cause it was behind glass.\n\n1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:52.960\n If you remember 2007, the Jesus phone comes up\n\n1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.280\n and no one could even touch them.\n\n1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:55.280\n You could just look at it\n\n1:38:55.280 --> 1:38:57.800\n in this beautiful museum quality box.\n\n1:38:57.800 --> 1:39:00.560\n Like it came from the future or whatever, the past.\n\n1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:02.040\n And it was just plastic.\n\n1:39:02.040 --> 1:39:06.080\n And it was like, oh, and you just looked\n\n1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:07.400\n and that was all you got.\n\n1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:10.560\n But then people said, well, what screen is,\n\n1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:13.200\n what covers on that, you know, reviewers who knew better,\n\n1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:15.440\n you know, it's plastic.\n\n1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:16.960\n And they were like, really?\n\n1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:20.000\n And so there was enough of a doubt there.\n\n1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.440\n And then when we started to do it,\n\n1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:24.080\n and then Steve changed the frame of reference\n\n1:39:24.080 --> 1:39:26.560\n of the question or of the result\n\n1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:28.200\n of what the customer would think.\n\n1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:31.360\n And he was like, if we designed it with plastic,\n\n1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:34.360\n with plastic and it's in their pocket all the time\n\n1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.920\n and it gets scratched by coins, slightly scratched\n\n1:39:36.920 --> 1:39:39.400\n or by keys or something like that.\n\n1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:41.600\n That is a design problem.\n\n1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:42.520\n We need to fix the problem.\n\n1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.120\n That was our bad.\n\n1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:49.640\n If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it\n\n1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:54.440\n and it cracks, it's the customer's fault.\n\n1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:56.200\n And they have much lower,\n\n1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.920\n they have less likelihood to complain.\n\n1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:00.240\n Yes, they'll complain,\n\n1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.480\n but they're part of that, of that failure.\n\n1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:05.320\n Yes.\n\n1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:06.640\n Oh, that's fascinating.\n\n1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:07.600\n And then.\n\n1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:08.600\n There's truth to that.\n\n1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:09.600\n Right?\n\n1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:11.840\n Because then they were part of why it failed.\n\n1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:13.680\n Whereas the design, they didn't do anything wrong.\n\n1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:16.800\n It was just sitting in their pocket and it's scratching\n\n1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:18.440\n and that's normal use.\n\n1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:19.920\n Abnormal use has been dropped.\n\n1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:23.120\n And we're like, oh, now we get it.\n\n1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:25.960\n And so we all moved to that mindset\n\n1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:30.320\n when you framed the problem and the solution in that way\n\n1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:32.160\n versus the original framing\n\n1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:34.120\n where we all landed on plastic.\n\n1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:37.120\n So, and then he was unrelenting on that,\n\n1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:41.080\n but we all had moved and we had moved mindset\n\n1:40:41.080 --> 1:40:45.560\n and we understood the why and we marshaled together.\n\n1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:48.760\n And then by the end of June, and it was crazy,\n\n1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:52.640\n the mechanical product design teams sourcing,\n\n1:40:52.640 --> 1:40:56.080\n all of us, the partner Corning pulled together\n\n1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:59.440\n to make that happen because it was the right reason.\n\n1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:00.280\n Right?\n\n1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.240\n So this, you look at these stories\n\n1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.960\n and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways,\n\n1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:08.960\n but that's not usually how it all happened\n\n1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:12.160\n of like one leader was, that's not how Steve was.\n\n1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:14.960\n Now I've seen leaders who are just pounding\n\n1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:18.080\n and just had no real empathy for the team\n\n1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.120\n and understanding the why.\n\n1:41:19.120 --> 1:41:21.040\n And it's just, it is the way I want it, right?\n\n1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:23.600\n I am the supreme leader.\n\n1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:25.680\n That wasn't like that when.\n\n1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:27.640\n He just had a very strong opinion.\n\n1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:29.280\n Very strong opinion.\n\n1:41:29.280 --> 1:41:30.840\n But it was challengeable.\n\n1:41:30.840 --> 1:41:33.360\n It was challengeable and if you came with the right thing,\n\n1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:35.640\n you know, it was, you could modulate that,\n\n1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:37.080\n but you had to come with a team.\n\n1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:38.240\n It couldn't just be you.\n\n1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:41.560\n It had to become a team and data and to overcome\n\n1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:43.200\n because it was a very strong opinion.\n\n1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:46.480\n And there's personal quirks of character, like you said.\n\n1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:47.760\n Bad days and good days.\n\n1:41:47.760 --> 1:41:48.600\n Bad days and good days.\n\n1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:51.320\n So there's also the three options you said.\n\n1:41:51.320 --> 1:41:53.880\n You noticed that the third option is always going\n\n1:41:53.880 --> 1:41:55.280\n to be the one that's picked.\n\n1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:57.240\n Those kinds of.\n\n1:41:57.240 --> 1:41:58.080\n Idiosyncrasies.\n\n1:41:58.080 --> 1:41:59.480\n Idiosyncrasies.\n\n1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:01.800\n And that, so that brings up another thing.\n\n1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:07.200\n You said challenge the idea, not the person.\n\n1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:13.480\n I'm somebody who has a, you know, I have a temper.\n\n1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:16.000\n I use colorful language and so on.\n\n1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.240\n On teams I work.\n\n1:42:17.240 --> 1:42:19.400\n In my private life I'm much calmer and so on.\n\n1:42:19.400 --> 1:42:21.200\n But I get, when I get really passionate\n\n1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:22.400\n with engineering teams.\n\n1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:24.960\n I've been called an asshole.\n\n1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:29.320\n And you get, I mean, I am distinctly aware\n\n1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:32.400\n that you cross lines often.\n\n1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:35.760\n There's like levels, right?\n\n1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:36.680\n Sure.\n\n1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.280\n You know, you could, it has to do with language\n\n1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:41.120\n and how language is heard.\n\n1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.480\n So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me.\n\n1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:44.520\n You could swear.\n\n1:42:44.520 --> 1:42:49.520\n You could say stuff that sounds, like, I don't know.\n\n1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:53.400\n Lex, sometimes I think you're the dumbest human\n\n1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:54.640\n on the face of the earth or something.\n\n1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:55.720\n I don't know.\n\n1:42:55.720 --> 1:42:57.360\n That sounds very personal, right?\n\n1:42:57.360 --> 1:42:58.840\n But I'm not gonna take that personally.\n\n1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.360\n I understand what's being said.\n\n1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:02.480\n And then I also notice that there's other people\n\n1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:04.520\n that take stuff more personally.\n\n1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:07.160\n This has to do with teams and figuring out like,\n\n1:43:07.160 --> 1:43:09.640\n okay, who's going to take certain words personally\n\n1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:10.920\n and not, and you have to know.\n\n1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:13.600\n That's what makes a great coach, a great leader,\n\n1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:16.960\n a mentor, you have to like factor all that in.\n\n1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:19.800\n But it just, there's something about just being an asshole\n\n1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:23.800\n and being passionate and really driven\n\n1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:26.920\n that sometimes you do cross lines.\n\n1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:30.280\n And that's, I don't know what to do with that\n\n1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:32.640\n because it feels like it comes with the territory.\n\n1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:36.240\n Like you have, it seems like you can't just have\n\n1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:38.840\n a perfectly optimized.\n\n1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:41.120\n No, no, absolutely not.\n\n1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:41.960\n We're humans.\n\n1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:42.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:43.840\n We're humans, we don't have a program.\n\n1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:46.320\n Everyone's programmed the same way to react the same way\n\n1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:48.080\n to given stimulus, right?\n\n1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:48.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:52.480\n So, you know, you said, I don't know\n\n1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:53.800\n if this was a real example, but you said,\n\n1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:56.560\n oh, you're the dumbest human on earth or whatever.\n\n1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:58.560\n I would never say that.\n\n1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:00.000\n Absolutely never.\n\n1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.800\n And if someone said that to me or I saw someone else say\n\n1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:06.160\n that to another person on the team, absolutely not.\n\n1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:08.640\n That is not allowed because that's judging someone.\n\n1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:10.680\n You may be heated and you can get heated\n\n1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:12.760\n and you can say it in your intonation,\n\n1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:15.240\n but to then try to put a label on it\n\n1:44:15.240 --> 1:44:17.920\n and put a label on a person, that is not allowed.\n\n1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:20.560\n So if you let that kind of culture happen\n\n1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:25.560\n and it becomes somewhat, you know, sometimes it's ingest,\n\n1:44:26.240 --> 1:44:28.000\n you know, it has to be very much ingest\n\n1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:29.040\n and those two people have to have\n\n1:44:29.040 --> 1:44:31.640\n a really good working relationship.\n\n1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:33.280\n But other than that, I'm sorry,\n\n1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:37.480\n it's gonna be a lot more, you could say a septic\n\n1:44:37.480 --> 1:44:39.720\n in that way that you're not gonna add that stuff in,\n\n1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:42.280\n but you can do it with all other types of ways\n\n1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:45.480\n without saying that because then people who do react\n\n1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:48.480\n to that kind of language and don't have those shields\n\n1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.720\n because they might not have that stream confidence level\n\n1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:54.360\n that you do and you can just brush it off,\n\n1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:56.960\n that can be very cancerous in a team\n\n1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:59.680\n because people then mean that and then they see,\n\n1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:01.240\n oh, that's the right way to be.\n\n1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:04.240\n You gotta snuff that out and you gotta be that,\n\n1:45:04.240 --> 1:45:06.200\n you gotta be that change or that model\n\n1:45:06.200 --> 1:45:08.000\n that you wanna show the team.\n\n1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.680\n Yes, it's too, even if it doesn't affect me,\n\n1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:14.200\n it's going to affect a significant enough fraction\n\n1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:17.480\n of brilliant people where that shouldn't be part\n\n1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:18.320\n of the culture.\n\n1:45:18.320 --> 1:45:20.200\n Exactly, and other people see that happen\n\n1:45:20.200 --> 1:45:22.720\n and then, oh, I guess that's acceptable, right?\n\n1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:24.600\n Just like politics in the workplace,\n\n1:45:24.600 --> 1:45:26.120\n is that acceptable or not?\n\n1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:29.160\n I call it out exactly when I see it in front of everyone,\n\n1:45:29.160 --> 1:45:32.800\n right, because it's just another ego driven thing.\n\n1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:35.640\n You have to set the tone as a leader\n\n1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.600\n for what you want your organization to be\n\n1:45:37.600 --> 1:45:39.800\n and how it gets reflected in the world\n\n1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:42.000\n and you have to uphold that and you can't,\n\n1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:44.840\n sure, you can have an excursion outside of that,\n\n1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:47.080\n but you have to go back and say, I'm sorry.\n\n1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.040\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:51.320\n You have to go and apologize, heal and said,\n\n1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:53.640\n I was not the person I wanted to be that day,\n\n1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:55.160\n I'm really sorry.\n\n1:45:55.160 --> 1:45:56.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:58.200\n This is, and even in front of the team\n\n1:45:58.200 --> 1:46:00.720\n and have that humility and say, we're all human here\n\n1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:01.680\n and just cause I'm the leader\n\n1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:03.400\n doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.\n\n1:46:03.400 --> 1:46:06.560\n So have the self awareness, apologize.\n\n1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:07.720\n Exactly.\n\n1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:10.240\n And that's also part of the culture.\n\n1:46:11.480 --> 1:46:12.320\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:16.840\n How are you different from Steve as a leader and designer?\n\n1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:20.320\n So you've spoken about sort of what made you strong,\n\n1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:22.120\n which is he was able to challenge,\n\n1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:26.040\n he was able to push you to bring out the best.\n\n1:46:26.040 --> 1:46:28.640\n Well, I come from the technical angle, right?\n\n1:46:28.640 --> 1:46:33.200\n Deep technology, software, hardware, systems thinking,\n\n1:46:33.200 --> 1:46:34.520\n implementation, all that stuff.\n\n1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:36.240\n So I have a different bent.\n\n1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:38.720\n He wanted to be an engineer, started,\n\n1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:40.880\n but really he was much better at all the other things,\n\n1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:43.440\n the storytelling, the interfacing\n\n1:46:43.440 --> 1:46:45.680\n and being the voice of the customer\n\n1:46:45.680 --> 1:46:47.920\n and being that product marketer in a way, right?\n\n1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:49.120\n That we talked about.\n\n1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:51.480\n I grew into being the product marketing, then marketing.\n\n1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:53.880\n He came really out the other way, right?\n\n1:46:53.880 --> 1:46:55.520\n And never got really deep technically.\n\n1:46:55.520 --> 1:46:57.560\n So that's two different mindsets.\n\n1:46:57.560 --> 1:46:58.760\n One's not better or worse.\n\n1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:00.120\n It's just, that's how it is.\n\n1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:05.000\n And it takes all kinds and all kinds can do great designs.\n\n1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:06.640\n Did it manifest itself differently?\n\n1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:09.960\n Just the fact that you came from those different places.\n\n1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:10.800\n Absolutely.\n\n1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:15.000\n Like what, so like the discussion about glass on the iPhone\n\n1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.160\n was probably had a different flavor to it.\n\n1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:18.000\n Sure.\n\n1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.320\n When you started getting into the technical details,\n\n1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:23.280\n enough so you're getting the third order technical details\n\n1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:25.680\n and he can't argue with that anymore.\n\n1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:27.960\n Then with somebody he's like, okay.\n\n1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:30.880\n At some point he's like, I can't win this war.\n\n1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:32.760\n And he learned that very early on\n\n1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:36.040\n because he didn't like the way the look of the Macintosh\n\n1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:39.480\n board, the PCB was laid out.\n\n1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:41.520\n He wanted it to be beautiful on the outside\n\n1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:42.480\n and on the inside.\n\n1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:44.920\n He's like, why are all these wires running this way?\n\n1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:47.240\n Why doesn't it have all this symmetry?\n\n1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.520\n And we have to make it beautiful on the inside.\n\n1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:52.120\n And even the traces on the boards\n\n1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:53.560\n have to look a certain way.\n\n1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:56.560\n So the teams made the board they knew that would work.\n\n1:47:56.560 --> 1:47:59.680\n And then they made the board that the way Steve wanted it.\n\n1:47:59.680 --> 1:48:01.000\n And that didn't work.\n\n1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.880\n And then Steve instantly figured out like at some point\n\n1:48:03.880 --> 1:48:05.960\n don't micromanage every single detail.\n\n1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:07.760\n There's some things he doesn't know enough about.\n\n1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:09.040\n And so he would get out of that.\n\n1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:11.200\n But that was one of those instances\n\n1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:13.320\n where he pushed really hard and that's his opinion.\n\n1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:14.480\n So they said, okay, we're gonna make it\n\n1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:16.680\n a data driven decision and we're gonna make both.\n\n1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:18.960\n I'm gonna show you the results, right?\n\n1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:21.440\n And then from there, he didn't get into those details.\n\n1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:25.160\n So from that, you could have a great challenge, right?\n\n1:48:25.160 --> 1:48:26.680\n Cause then you could get those data and say,\n\n1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:27.560\n we can't do that.\n\n1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:29.560\n And let me show you why, or we can do that.\n\n1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:31.080\n And then Steve would go, you can't do that.\n\n1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:32.000\n And you're like, oh, we can do that.\n\n1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:33.120\n Let me show you, right?\n\n1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:34.800\n So there's certain times when you were like\n\n1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:36.400\n bringing something to reality\n\n1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:39.280\n that he didn't think could exist, right?\n\n1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:42.760\n So it was always that creative tension,\n\n1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:46.240\n that interaction that was so successful, right?\n\n1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:48.440\n I think, but there was one other fundamental thing\n\n1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.840\n that was different and that it graded on the team\n\n1:48:52.920 --> 1:48:56.480\n and that I made sure and I learned from to not do.\n\n1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:00.640\n And I maybe overdue now in the opposite direction,\n\n1:49:00.640 --> 1:49:04.640\n which is when there's a great idea that comes from the team,\n\n1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:07.840\n acknowledge that person and go, that is a great idea.\n\n1:49:07.840 --> 1:49:11.040\n As the leader, the opinion driven, that's a great idea.\n\n1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:11.920\n Let's build on that.\n\n1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:13.160\n Let's see if that can do that.\n\n1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:15.480\n Or it's a great idea, but not for now, put it aside.\n\n1:49:15.480 --> 1:49:17.880\n But call out when people have great ideas\n\n1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:19.360\n because it's infectious.\n\n1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:21.800\n And that means maybe not ideas that come bubble up\n\n1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:24.440\n to the customer level, but inside the organization.\n\n1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:26.320\n People like they get rewarded for their ideas\n\n1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:27.760\n and say, that's a great one.\n\n1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:32.880\n Steve was always like, you give an idea\n\n1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:37.400\n and he would go, okay, I don't know.\n\n1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:38.960\n The next day, 24 hours later,\n\n1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.840\n it would come back with slight modifications.\n\n1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:43.840\n I've had this genius idea, right?\n\n1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:46.760\n And it's sooner or later we'd look around the table\n\n1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:49.280\n and we'd like roll our eyes and go, here we go again.\n\n1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:53.360\n So it demotivates you from generating ideas a little bit.\n\n1:49:53.360 --> 1:49:55.080\n Well, we got used to it,\n\n1:49:55.080 --> 1:49:59.640\n but later on in the team, it was just not,\n\n1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:02.160\n it doesn't want to bring the best, right?\n\n1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:05.760\n Cause if you're always like, the reaction is never,\n\n1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:07.600\n that's a genius idea.\n\n1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:11.240\n It was always like, it was either negative or neutral.\n\n1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:13.200\n Right?\n\n1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:15.840\n Then it doesn't have that same emotional effect\n\n1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:17.840\n that you want you to bring your best.\n\n1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:19.880\n Yeah, sometimes it's fun when people get excited\n\n1:50:19.880 --> 1:50:21.040\n by just, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.240\n You kind of build on top excitement.\n\n1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:25.880\n It could be, but coupled with sort of harshness\n\n1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:28.840\n when the idea is bad and you call out the bad ideas too.\n\n1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:30.760\n So it's the good and the bad.\n\n1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:33.920\n Oh, you could say, you don't have to say bad idea.\n\n1:50:33.920 --> 1:50:35.560\n You say, maybe not now.\n\n1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:37.000\n Let's table that for later.\n\n1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.520\n Let's discuss it or say, that's a decent idea.\n\n1:50:40.520 --> 1:50:42.120\n But did you think about that idea this way?\n\n1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:43.840\n Not just no or yes,\n\n1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:46.880\n but let's talk about why that might not be applicable\n\n1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:48.920\n in this case so that they can learn.\n\n1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:50.760\n So the next time they bring the next idea,\n\n1:50:50.760 --> 1:50:52.440\n they can modulate and understand\n\n1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:55.040\n to start seeing through the opinion based decision makers\n\n1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:56.160\n or the databases to bring it\n\n1:50:56.160 --> 1:50:59.480\n and bring better formatted arguments or ideas\n\n1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:02.320\n so that you have better chance of success the next time.\n\n1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:03.160\n Yeah. Right?\n\n1:51:03.160 --> 1:51:04.880\n You got to train through those moments.\n\n1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:07.360\n You got to teach, those are teaching moments.\n\n1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:08.800\n Teaching moments.\n\n1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:10.760\n I aspire to be that kind of person.\n\n1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:14.480\n I'll usually just say that idea is shit.\n\n1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:18.320\n That is the like, and then you,\n\n1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:21.080\n I remember that this brilliant person\n\n1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:23.080\n just gave that really shitty idea.\n\n1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:24.640\n So I remember to make sure the next time\n\n1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:27.360\n they give a good idea, I really compliment that good idea.\n\n1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:32.080\n But I personally, I mean, it's emotion,\n\n1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:34.680\n but I call out the really shitty ideas.\n\n1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:36.520\n But you should call it the really great ones.\n\n1:51:36.520 --> 1:51:38.200\n If you let the pendulum swing both ways,\n\n1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:40.080\n then everybody goes, he's balanced.\n\n1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:42.000\n It's always one way.\n\n1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.680\n Why bring any idea?\n\n1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:45.120\n I'm all about the pendulum.\n\n1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.320\n Right?\n\n1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:51.240\n You got to have both, the joy and the pain.\n\n1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:53.880\n Don't you give me pain all the time.\n\n1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:55.840\n So you mentioned the glass and the iPhone.\n\n1:51:55.840 --> 1:51:59.000\n So you wanted to, not just the iPod, not just Nest.\n\n1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:00.480\n You were one of the key figures\n\n1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.000\n in the creation of the iPhone.\n\n1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:03.720\n What's the interesting aspects?\n\n1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:05.520\n What's the good, the bad, and the ugly\n\n1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:07.440\n of the origin story of the iPhone?\n\n1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:10.640\n Again, this is a Netflix series\n\n1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:13.480\n that spans multiple seasons.\n\n1:52:13.480 --> 1:52:14.480\n Change my flight, please.\n\n1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:18.320\n Yeah, what was the, what interesting memories\n\n1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:19.440\n you have from the finding?\n\n1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:24.440\n So the pain and the joy that was foundational\n\n1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:30.840\n to the iPod, all the CDs you had to lug around.\n\n1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:36.320\n What was the pain and the joy and the vision\n\n1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:39.880\n of the iPhone in your mind, in the mind of the team,\n\n1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:42.080\n in Steve's mind, and so on?\n\n1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:44.360\n Well, you know, there's multiple pains.\n\n1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:46.440\n You have to also look, there's not just customer pain,\n\n1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:48.720\n but there's business pain, okay?\n\n1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.520\n And it's about the, so Apple now is getting out\n\n1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:54.440\n of that place where it was in 2001.\n\n1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:56.480\n Now people are starting to pay attention.\n\n1:52:56.480 --> 1:52:58.440\n Apple's starting to get in the culture again.\n\n1:52:58.440 --> 1:53:00.160\n It's becoming relevant.\n\n1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:01.760\n Cash is starting to flow.\n\n1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:06.560\n iPod is 60% of that, of the revenue,\n\n1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.560\n total revenue of Apple doing an 85% market share.\n\n1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:11.960\n You're starting to get a wind at your back.\n\n1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:13.080\n You got confidence.\n\n1:53:13.080 --> 1:53:15.920\n Like Apple had been beaten down since probably\n\n1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:18.720\n the first time the Mac was, since the Mac,\n\n1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:21.520\n it was a beaten company ever since the Mac.\n\n1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:25.320\n So we're talking 15 years at that point, right?\n\n1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:27.840\n This is the first time you're seeing like,\n\n1:53:27.840 --> 1:53:30.920\n and Steve would proudly came in front of us and said,\n\n1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.520\n today I can tell you all of the employees,\n\n1:53:34.520 --> 1:53:36.000\n we are now out of debt.\n\n1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.200\n We paid off our debt.\n\n1:53:38.200 --> 1:53:42.360\n It was a joyous moment for him, right?\n\n1:53:42.360 --> 1:53:43.680\n And then ultimately for our team\n\n1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:47.720\n because no more debt, wonderful, right?\n\n1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:50.520\n So now what you have is you have this successful thing\n\n1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:55.160\n changing the face of Apple and you hear these\n\n1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:59.880\n heavy stomping footsteps of the mobile phone industry.\n\n1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:01.040\n Boom.\n\n1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:03.360\n And it's the feature phones at that time.\n\n1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:04.520\n They're adding cameras.\n\n1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:06.240\n They're adding color displays.\n\n1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:08.800\n They're seeing the success of the iPod and going,\n\n1:54:08.800 --> 1:54:12.840\n that's just music, we have some storage.\n\n1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:15.160\n We can load music on our phones\n\n1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:18.120\n and we can do what the iPod does plus more.\n\n1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.400\n Boom, boom, boom, right?\n\n1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:25.520\n And you're like, and how many hundreds of millions\n\n1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:27.160\n of them are being sold at that point?\n\n1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:29.080\n It wasn't billions yet, but it was still,\n\n1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:31.400\n a hundred million, 200 million a year.\n\n1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:32.400\n iPod hadn't gotten there.\n\n1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:36.680\n It was for 20, 40, 50 million, something like that.\n\n1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:37.760\n So now you're like, okay,\n\n1:54:37.760 --> 1:54:41.240\n what are we gonna do about this Goliath\n\n1:54:41.240 --> 1:54:44.600\n who wants to take our lunch, right?\n\n1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:46.520\n The schoolyard bully.\n\n1:54:46.520 --> 1:54:50.120\n And so there was one, let's partner with them.\n\n1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:54.320\n So iTunes music store was there.\n\n1:54:54.320 --> 1:54:57.000\n All of these phones are gonna need music\n\n1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:00.760\n so they can come to the iTunes music store\n\n1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:02.200\n and get that music for those phones\n\n1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.400\n because it wasn't just about the hardware player\n\n1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:05.360\n at that point.\n\n1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:07.600\n It was about the software that you need on the desktop\n\n1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:10.080\n and the content that you needed to download.\n\n1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:12.640\n So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool\n\n1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:14.720\n as Steve would always refer to it.\n\n1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:16.680\n So now the mobile phone industry,\n\n1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:18.920\n okay, we're gonna work with them.\n\n1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:22.600\n They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically\n\n1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.120\n inside of a phone, can have 99 songs total.\n\n1:55:27.120 --> 1:55:29.560\n And they're gonna come to our store and you're gonna,\n\n1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:31.200\n I was like, okay, great.\n\n1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:32.240\n It's all gonna be well and good.\n\n1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.040\n And that became the Motorola rocker project.\n\n1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:38.400\n It was Apple and Motorola getting together.\n\n1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:41.280\n There's gonna be software on this smartphone\n\n1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:43.080\n or not smartphone, but feature phone\n\n1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:45.480\n to hook to iTunes to get your music.\n\n1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.760\n It wasn't even downloadable over a cloud or anything\n\n1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:49.160\n because that wasn't available yet.\n\n1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:51.600\n There wasn't data networks yet.\n\n1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:56.520\n It was a disaster from the beginning.\n\n1:55:56.520 --> 1:55:58.120\n Two different cultures,\n\n1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:01.200\n two different types of leadership styles,\n\n1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:03.080\n not necessarily the most competent engineers\n\n1:56:03.080 --> 1:56:06.080\n on the other side.\n\n1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:10.360\n And it turned out to be an absolute horrible disaster.\n\n1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:11.400\n I watched the pains,\n\n1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:12.800\n cause luckily I didn't have to be part of it.\n\n1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:14.600\n I watched the pains on Jeff Robbins face\n\n1:56:14.600 --> 1:56:15.520\n each time we would meet.\n\n1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:20.520\n And he would be like, these guys are just like, really?\n\n1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:21.960\n Do we have to do this, Steve?\n\n1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:24.120\n And he's like, we're contractually obligated.\n\n1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:26.720\n And when it came out on stage and Steve showed it,\n\n1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:28.760\n it was maybe a one minute,\n\n1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:31.560\n Steve loves those extended, like drawn up.\n\n1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:33.560\n It might've been a one minute, two minute kind of thing.\n\n1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.600\n And he literally threw that phone out of his hand\n\n1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:37.400\n as fast as he could, right?\n\n1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:38.240\n Cause it was horrible.\n\n1:56:38.240 --> 1:56:41.480\n So there was the pain of we're not gonna partner.\n\n1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:43.400\n So if we can't partner with these guys,\n\n1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:47.400\n we have to become one of them to actually compete,\n\n1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:49.840\n to save the thing that is bringing Apple\n\n1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:53.200\n from that 15 years of malaise, right?\n\n1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:59.760\n So then from that, we were made a prototype\n\n1:56:59.760 --> 1:57:04.600\n of an iPod plus phone, a classic with it was an iPod,\n\n1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.760\n but it had a phone inside with all the music\n\n1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:07.600\n and all the other stuff.\n\n1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:09.280\n And you use your headset,\n\n1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:12.800\n wired headset to do the audio, right?\n\n1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:15.600\n There was another project at the same time\n\n1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:19.760\n cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store,\n\n1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:23.120\n iTunes video store for music videos and movies.\n\n1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:26.760\n And it would be a full screen iPod.\n\n1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:29.200\n So instead of the classic, the way you know it,\n\n1:57:29.200 --> 1:57:31.720\n but it would be full screen\n\n1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:34.160\n and it would have a virtual click wheel.\n\n1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:36.760\n You'd have a virtual, like single touch touchscreen\n\n1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:38.760\n that you could scroll, right?\n\n1:57:38.760 --> 1:57:41.960\n Think of maybe an iPhone, like you knew it, right?\n\n1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:44.360\n And then there was a third project going on,\n\n1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:46.440\n not in, those two were going on in my team,\n\n1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:48.360\n but the third project going on\n\n1:57:48.360 --> 1:57:52.160\n was the multi touchscreen technology\n\n1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:55.920\n to drive a Mac tablet.\n\n1:57:55.920 --> 1:58:00.920\n And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology,\n\n1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:02.560\n there was just way too much you had to change\n\n1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:04.520\n on the software and everything\n\n1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:06.480\n to be able to use a tablet, right?\n\n1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:07.320\n We see this all the time.\n\n1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:09.320\n Like people are like, there's not enough tablet apps today\n\n1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:10.640\n that are modified for tablet.\n\n1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.920\n They're just phone apps that are grown up, right?\n\n1:58:12.920 --> 1:58:15.560\n So then they would just be Mac touch stuff.\n\n1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:17.960\n So you'd have to have a whole developer community.\n\n1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:19.720\n That probably wasn't the best place\n\n1:58:19.720 --> 1:58:21.560\n to take that technology first.\n\n1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:23.120\n So you take that technology,\n\n1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:24.360\n marry it with the full screen,\n\n1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:26.920\n that technology, marry it with the full screen iPod\n\n1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:28.360\n and the phone stuff we were working\n\n1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:31.040\n because the iPod phone with a rotary dial\n\n1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:32.600\n was just like a rotary phone.\n\n1:58:32.600 --> 1:58:35.920\n We couldn't make that interface work well for data input.\n\n1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:38.720\n You put those three together.\n\n1:58:38.720 --> 1:58:41.080\n And now is where those three things\n\n1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:44.840\n that then created the form or the technology\n\n1:58:44.840 --> 1:58:48.480\n and the form inside what would become the iPhone,\n\n1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:51.840\n married with a bunch of low level software\n\n1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:54.560\n from the iPod and manufacturing software\n\n1:58:54.560 --> 1:58:57.440\n and drivers and communication stuff,\n\n1:58:57.440 --> 1:59:02.440\n combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS.\n\n1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:06.000\n And I mean that in the best way.\n\n1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.040\n It means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little.\n\n1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:11.480\n It was totally, things were hacked out and changed\n\n1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:13.280\n and new code was inserted.\n\n1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:16.560\n And it really was a whole set of things\n\n1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:20.480\n from all different places to make that first iPhone OS.\n\n1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:23.360\n And then there was another team working on the apps\n\n1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:25.000\n and then another team working on the design\n\n1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.600\n of how it looked overall between all that stuff.\n\n1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:29.400\n So all of those things came together\n\n1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:32.840\n to create what we know as the first generation iPhone.\n\n1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:34.800\n And those are all probably fascinating\n\n1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:36.160\n engineering challenges.\n\n1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:37.000\n Correct.\n\n1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:41.440\n And great teams like creating the Frankenstein OS.\n\n1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:45.200\n That's fascinating because you're simplifying and simplifying\n\n1:59:45.200 --> 1:59:47.200\n but then you're just pulling different stuff from,\n\n1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:49.520\n and you're basically inventing,\n\n1:59:49.520 --> 1:59:51.280\n I mean, they're probably not thinking of it that way,\n\n1:59:51.280 --> 1:59:56.040\n but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer.\n\n1:59:56.040 --> 1:59:57.280\n It really is Frankenstein.\n\n1:59:57.280 --> 1:59:59.640\n Right, and you didn't have to run Mac software.\n\n1:59:59.640 --> 2:00:02.280\n If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time,\n\n2:00:02.280 --> 2:00:04.960\n like Windows and stuff, they were like,\n\n2:00:04.960 --> 2:00:06.880\n we need to make sure it runs Excel\n\n2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:08.760\n and it runs Word or something like that\n\n2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:09.920\n in some reduced thing.\n\n2:00:09.920 --> 2:00:11.040\n This was like, no, no, no, no.\n\n2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:12.760\n This was born out of entertainment.\n\n2:00:12.760 --> 2:00:15.840\n So we didn't have to go and take all the same application,\n\n2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:19.240\n you know, all those other ones was about compatibility.\n\n2:00:19.240 --> 2:00:21.760\n This was about a whole new way of being.\n\n2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:26.560\n What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation\n\n2:00:26.560 --> 2:00:31.560\n of the iPhone, the sort of, the first iPhone, you know.\n\n2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:34.480\n Phone, internet communicator, and the iPod in your pocket.\n\n2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:36.840\n Yeah, that you're going to sort of present,\n\n2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:41.320\n announcing three new products kind of thing\n\n2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:43.280\n and then saying that it's all in one.\n\n2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:44.920\n Just, this is a good example,\n\n2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:49.920\n one of the sort of historic presentations of a product.\n\n2:00:52.520 --> 2:00:55.040\n Clearly there's like some showmanship that works,\n\n2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:56.760\n some reason it works.\n\n2:00:56.760 --> 2:00:59.560\n It doesn't always work, it often doesn't work,\n\n2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:02.800\n but it did in this case, it often did for Steve.\n\n2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:04.920\n What, like, how did that feel?\n\n2:01:06.200 --> 2:01:11.200\n What part of the actually the design process\n\n2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:13.440\n was that presentation?\n\n2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:14.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:15.800\n In the early, because you said,\n\n2:01:15.800 --> 2:01:17.960\n should consider the why, the press release\n\n2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:19.400\n at the very beginning.\n\n2:01:19.400 --> 2:01:21.240\n Steve was doing that the entire time.\n\n2:01:21.240 --> 2:01:24.560\n He was working on that story from day one.\n\n2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:27.320\n He was pitching us this, this, this, and then this.\n\n2:01:27.320 --> 2:01:29.240\n And then he would look at our faces\n\n2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:31.320\n because you wouldn't, most people wouldn't,\n\n2:01:31.320 --> 2:01:32.720\n at least if you're working for him,\n\n2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:34.200\n wouldn't tell him what you really thought\n\n2:01:34.200 --> 2:01:36.920\n of what he was saying, but he would look at your faces.\n\n2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:39.760\n And then he would talk to a few real trusted confidence\n\n2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:44.120\n outside of the organization.\n\n2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:45.880\n And see what they thought, right?\n\n2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:47.560\n And they could give him feedback on it\n\n2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:49.200\n and they could really challenge him,\n\n2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:51.440\n but he would also look at their faces and go, hmm.\n\n2:01:51.440 --> 2:01:53.800\n And so when you see that, hmm,\n\n2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:56.160\n then he would modulate it and change it slightly\n\n2:01:56.160 --> 2:01:57.000\n and change it.\n\n2:01:57.000 --> 2:01:59.000\n So he was working during all of that time\n\n2:01:59.000 --> 2:02:01.440\n on the story and the storytelling, right?\n\n2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:03.920\n And the whys, while we're working on that\n\n2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:04.840\n and helping us refine it,\n\n2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:08.520\n just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?\n\n2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:10.160\n All the time working on that.\n\n2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:12.080\n So when he comes out on stage,\n\n2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:15.680\n he does something that every marketer is told not to do.\n\n2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:18.160\n Say these three things are now combined in one.\n\n2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:23.000\n That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form\n\n2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.760\n of storytelling possible for marketing, right?\n\n2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:28.000\n Yeah. Right?\n\n2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:31.240\n But it was the best one because it was all those pains.\n\n2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:35.280\n It was like, I want my iPod, but I want my communications\n\n2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:37.840\n and I want my internet browsing because I want it on the go\n\n2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:40.720\n so I can look up things because it was information.\n\n2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:42.800\n And when you were on the road, you had a laptop,\n\n2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:45.680\n you had an iPod and you had a phone that,\n\n2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:49.040\n and you had to carry all of these things with you at once.\n\n2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:51.640\n Now we're gonna solve that pain for you\n\n2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:52.960\n and put it all together.\n\n2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:54.400\n So he was just showing you the pain\n\n2:02:54.400 --> 2:02:55.840\n and beating that virus of doubt and going,\n\n2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:57.800\n it's now in this one magical thing.\n\n2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:00.800\n And he could come up and masterfully tell that story\n\n2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:03.640\n because he told it almost every day\n\n2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:06.680\n to all of these people inside very quietly.\n\n2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:09.320\n And then it was just, right?\n\n2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:12.400\n It was like a Tony award winning play\n\n2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:14.640\n that had been worked on for 10 years.\n\n2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:17.000\n But also the human came through, the timing.\n\n2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:18.520\n It was all that, it was all of it.\n\n2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:20.640\n And of course he was dramatic at certain points\n\n2:03:20.640 --> 2:03:23.840\n and he would raise his voice and a wry smile\n\n2:03:23.840 --> 2:03:24.680\n or whatever it was.\n\n2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:25.520\n Right, that wry smile was magic.\n\n2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:26.560\n It was all those touches.\n\n2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:29.120\n He was an actor as well as a storyteller.\n\n2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:29.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:32.640\n But it was the truth, right?\n\n2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:33.960\n The truth came through.\n\n2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:36.440\n It was a nonfiction story.\n\n2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:39.800\n And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it\n\n2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:41.120\n for dramatic effect.\n\n2:03:42.880 --> 2:03:43.720\n It's amazing.\n\n2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:50.280\n So there's a designer you mentioned, Johnny Ave.\n\n2:03:51.840 --> 2:03:55.560\n You both are brilliant designers, great human beings.\n\n2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:59.160\n There were some battles fought in the distant past\n\n2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:00.520\n between the two of you.\n\n2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:04.040\n Looking back, what is the positive characteristics\n\n2:04:04.040 --> 2:04:07.120\n of Johnny that made you a better person and designer\n\n2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:08.240\n having worked with him?\n\n2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:18.600\n Watching the process that the design team that Johnny led.\n\n2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:22.080\n I don't know where, cause that was over years.\n\n2:04:22.080 --> 2:04:23.440\n I didn't see all of those things.\n\n2:04:23.440 --> 2:04:26.200\n But watching the design process of really,\n\n2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:29.880\n cause it was really a team that was about materials.\n\n2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:31.360\n It was about form.\n\n2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:32.680\n It was about colors.\n\n2:04:32.680 --> 2:04:35.640\n It was about these physical characteristics.\n\n2:04:36.760 --> 2:04:38.800\n When we talked about this earlier was design.\n\n2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:39.640\n What is design?\n\n2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:41.040\n Design's everywhere, okay?\n\n2:04:41.040 --> 2:04:43.680\n So what they were really focused on was form,\n\n2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:47.720\n how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics,\n\n2:04:47.720 --> 2:04:49.120\n the physical aesthetics.\n\n2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:53.200\n And watching, going through that process,\n\n2:04:53.200 --> 2:04:58.200\n I learned so much in that process about how to do colors,\n\n2:04:58.200 --> 2:05:03.200\n how to do materials, how to think deeply about curves,\n\n2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:10.040\n and shadows, and how it would look, not just in your hand,\n\n2:05:10.040 --> 2:05:12.120\n but how it would look in the photograph\n\n2:05:12.120 --> 2:05:14.840\n you were gonna take for marketing, right?\n\n2:05:14.840 --> 2:05:19.240\n So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it.\n\n2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:23.640\n It was all of those physical things around that\n\n2:05:23.640 --> 2:05:28.480\n and watching the process to get there,\n\n2:05:28.480 --> 2:05:31.240\n that was enlightening for me, right?\n\n2:05:31.240 --> 2:05:35.040\n It opened my mind to go, oh, okay.\n\n2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:37.240\n Just like there's a process for all these other things,\n\n2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:39.800\n it wasn't just magic and you say,\n\n2:05:41.400 --> 2:05:42.680\n ha, ha, ha, there it is.\n\n2:05:42.680 --> 2:05:44.800\n It was really a process of refinement,\n\n2:05:44.800 --> 2:05:46.760\n you know, of opening the funnel at the beginning\n\n2:05:46.760 --> 2:05:51.040\n and refining down over time to get to that final,\n\n2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:53.760\n the final and selecting and doing the selection.\n\n2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:55.120\n And certain types you could,\n\n2:05:55.120 --> 2:05:58.920\n certain times there were opinion based design details.\n\n2:05:58.920 --> 2:06:02.040\n But a lot of data, a lot of data driven designs\n\n2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:05.400\n of what can we deliver in volume?\n\n2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:06.600\n What can we do different things?\n\n2:06:06.600 --> 2:06:08.680\n So you always had these constraints\n\n2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:09.640\n that you had to work with under.\n\n2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:13.040\n And sometimes they, and the team,\n\n2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:14.840\n not just I, would say, we need this.\n\n2:06:14.840 --> 2:06:16.920\n And we're like, we can't deliver that.\n\n2:06:16.920 --> 2:06:18.760\n But maybe we were able to work together\n\n2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:20.840\n to find different design characteristics\n\n2:06:20.840 --> 2:06:23.320\n and different implementation characteristics\n\n2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:25.520\n that could get to that point\n\n2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:27.520\n without what they were describing.\n\n2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:30.840\n And instead of yes, yes, yes, no, no, no,\n\n2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:34.520\n let's find some other way to solve the problem together.\n\n2:06:34.520 --> 2:06:39.520\n Yeah, is, and I've seen this in several companies\n\n2:06:40.080 --> 2:06:43.480\n I've more closely interacted with, like Tesla is an example.\n\n2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:46.400\n Sometimes, you know, talking about curves,\n\n2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:51.160\n sometimes it's very painful on the engineering side\n\n2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:55.400\n to deliver a very specific kind of thing.\n\n2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:59.120\n And one question that comes up in my mind is like,\n\n2:06:59.120 --> 2:07:02.920\n well, how far should we go to try to deliver\n\n2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:06.920\n a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature,\n\n2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:10.400\n or in like whatever the form factor is,\n\n2:07:10.400 --> 2:07:12.440\n or the color of the material,\n\n2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:15.560\n when the cost is like 10X to deliver,\n\n2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:17.760\n not financially, but just like in effort,\n\n2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:20.800\n like how many problems to have to solve.\n\n2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:26.400\n I don't know if you can say any wisdom to that,\n\n2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:29.200\n because when you're thinking about curves,\n\n2:07:29.200 --> 2:07:31.280\n you're designing in the space of ideas,\n\n2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:34.320\n you're like platonic forms kind of thing,\n\n2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:38.480\n not always grounded to like how much this is,\n\n2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:40.960\n how much pain is gonna be involved in delivering this,\n\n2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:44.200\n but that's as you should perhaps,\n\n2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:47.400\n because then if you're always thinking about the pain\n\n2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:51.240\n required to deliver this thing, you'll be too conservative,\n\n2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:53.040\n you wouldn't do the wild ideas.\n\n2:07:54.160 --> 2:07:57.080\n Right, exactly, but you have to understand again\n\n2:07:57.080 --> 2:07:58.320\n the why behind it.\n\n2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:01.680\n And at Nest, when we had limited resources,\n\n2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:04.680\n you know, putting a screwdriver in the box,\n\n2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:07.520\n a custom designed screwdriver in the box,\n\n2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:10.040\n was born out of those experiences I had at Apple,\n\n2:08:10.040 --> 2:08:12.440\n and seeing how you can create something\n\n2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:15.200\n that's emotional, it's part of marketing,\n\n2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:17.800\n and it's part of the product experience overall,\n\n2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:20.360\n even though it seems extraneous.\n\n2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:23.320\n I went back and made the design team,\n\n2:08:23.320 --> 2:08:25.720\n and the mechanical team change some curves\n\n2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:28.240\n on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector\n\n2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:32.000\n we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it.\n\n2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:33.240\n And I said, they're saying these cost more,\n\n2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:35.360\n I said, it doesn't look right.\n\n2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:37.680\n There is a, but they're like, oh, well we had,\n\n2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:39.280\n I said, no, you're gonna go back,\n\n2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:40.440\n and you're gonna make that change,\n\n2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:43.000\n I told you we needed to do it,\n\n2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:45.520\n we had a better looking model, that is gonna get done,\n\n2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:48.720\n I know it's gonna be a terrible cost to you,\n\n2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:50.560\n but we already had this discussion,\n\n2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:52.200\n and that's the way it's gonna have to be,\n\n2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:55.000\n and I'm sorry, but it is what it is.\n\n2:08:56.640 --> 2:08:58.880\n And you know, because it's better for the customer,\n\n2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:00.040\n and it looks better in the pictures,\n\n2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:00.880\n and all the other stuff.\n\n2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:02.200\n And then we did it, and it was great,\n\n2:09:02.200 --> 2:09:04.320\n and everyone agreed it was great at the end,\n\n2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:05.720\n but it was pain to get there.\n\n2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.120\n Those are where, those little details\n\n2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:11.080\n are where the magic comes out, right?\n\n2:09:11.080 --> 2:09:15.640\n And if you don't do, if you don't take those pains\n\n2:09:15.640 --> 2:09:18.960\n and put in the love, the customer's gonna feel,\n\n2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:20.760\n it's gonna, they're either gonna feel the pain,\n\n2:09:20.760 --> 2:09:22.520\n or they're gonna feel the love,\n\n2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:23.800\n if you put it in, right?\n\n2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:26.960\n So it depends on how much time and effort\n\n2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:28.360\n you wanna put into something,\n\n2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:30.120\n and what really matters to you,\n\n2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:32.480\n and so how you communicate what you do.\n\n2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:34.120\n We're human beings after all,\n\n2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:36.920\n is there something you've learned\n\n2:09:36.920 --> 2:09:40.520\n from sort of the tensions that are natural,\n\n2:09:40.520 --> 2:09:43.120\n or that happen in teams when they're passionate,\n\n2:09:43.120 --> 2:09:45.440\n and they're trying to solve these problems?\n\n2:09:45.440 --> 2:09:47.200\n Is that the way of life?\n\n2:09:47.200 --> 2:09:49.800\n And there's the human drama.\n\n2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:51.800\n Is that just, is that always going,\n\n2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:54.280\n is that, it is what it is?\n\n2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:55.520\n Is that make you better?\n\n2:09:55.520 --> 2:09:58.880\n Actually, the drama, the tension between personalities,\n\n2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:00.280\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:04.440\n Look, a rollercoaster ride without ups and downs\n\n2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:05.440\n is no fun.\n\n2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:10.000\n It's the journey, it's the journey that brings,\n\n2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.240\n it brings out the best in everyone.\n\n2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:17.160\n We're forged, we're tempered by those experiences,\n\n2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:19.720\n not all the ups, but also the downs,\n\n2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.040\n and that's when you get the humanity and the connection,\n\n2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:25.120\n and we can tell these stories till we're blue in the face,\n\n2:10:25.120 --> 2:10:28.760\n and smile every time, because we did something together\n\n2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:30.640\n that each of us couldn't do apart,\n\n2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:32.120\n but when it comes together,\n\n2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:34.000\n that's where all the emotions happen,\n\n2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.640\n and that's where, if it's born out of the right reasons,\n\n2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:38.520\n and the right story, and the right way,\n\n2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:40.120\n that's where the magic happens,\n\n2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:41.560\n not just for the customer,\n\n2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:43.960\n but for how it transforms each person\n\n2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:45.240\n who is working on it,\n\n2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:48.400\n and they will never forget those experiences in their life,\n\n2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:51.240\n positively and negatively, that happened at the time,\n\n2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:53.680\n but they look back, and it's only positive,\n\n2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:55.680\n because they did something that mattered.\n\n2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:00.360\n Yet another brilliant idea that you brought to life\n\n2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:05.360\n is Nest, Nest thermostats, and the big umbrella of Nest.\n\n2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:13.040\n Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three,\n\n2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:17.760\n what was the most memorable, the most painful,\n\n2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.680\n the most insight leading challenge\n\n2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:24.720\n you had to overcome to bring Nest to life?\n\n2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.720\n Well, the first thing for me was making someone care\n\n2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:35.560\n about their thermostat.\n\n2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:39.560\n No one considers it.\n\n2:11:39.560 --> 2:11:41.640\n They never had any customer choice.\n\n2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:43.160\n They didn't install it.\n\n2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:44.440\n They usually don't even use it,\n\n2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:46.520\n because it's so complicated, or what have you,\n\n2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:50.480\n they just, they bitch at it, they hide it in the corner,\n\n2:11:50.480 --> 2:11:52.400\n and then they just pay the bill, right,\n\n2:11:52.400 --> 2:11:54.240\n of whatever it is, right?\n\n2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:58.120\n It's totally unloved, unconsidered, right?\n\n2:11:58.120 --> 2:12:00.680\n So how do you wake up, like I said, the virus of doubt,\n\n2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:03.400\n how do you wake that up and get people going,\n\n2:12:03.400 --> 2:12:05.440\n remember every day when you go in and it's like,\n\n2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:07.240\n you're just frustrated, and then you get the bill\n\n2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:08.800\n and you pay the bill, so you have to do that.\n\n2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:10.000\n So that was one thing.\n\n2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.960\n I think the other big one was not delivering,\n\n2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:14.040\n all of it was hard, right?\n\n2:12:14.040 --> 2:12:16.280\n It was constrained, we had only so much stuff,\n\n2:12:16.280 --> 2:12:19.080\n we were bootstrapped, we didn't have massive funding,\n\n2:12:19.080 --> 2:12:21.200\n we didn't get hundreds of millions of dollars,\n\n2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:22.360\n but we did it for the right reasons.\n\n2:12:22.360 --> 2:12:25.440\n But I think the other big part of it was\n\n2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:27.720\n not just building a disruptive product,\n\n2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:29.680\n because a lot of the people on the team had done that,\n\n2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:32.920\n we knew what we were doing, and that was,\n\n2:12:32.920 --> 2:12:35.680\n if we got the design right, we could deliver it\n\n2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:38.760\n with enough time.\n\n2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:42.960\n It was getting the disruptive go to market,\n\n2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.880\n in other words, how to take that product\n\n2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:46.760\n from the end of the production line\n\n2:12:46.760 --> 2:12:49.400\n and get it into the customer's hands,\n\n2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:53.760\n because there was no retail or customer choice\n\n2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:54.960\n in thermostats.\n\n2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.760\n No one even, it was never considered purchase.\n\n2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:00.040\n They never thought they had choice.\n\n2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:03.400\n Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack,\n\n2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:05.920\n told them, looked around, looked at their house\n\n2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:08.680\n and said, this looks like somebody who's got,\n\n2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:09.920\n is well to do.\n\n2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:13.080\n This thermostat is now gonna cost you $350,\n\n2:13:13.080 --> 2:13:14.560\n thank you very much.\n\n2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:17.120\n And you're like, I'll take whatever you give me, right?\n\n2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:18.800\n And then it goes into another house,\n\n2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:21.720\n it's worth $100, it was the same damn thing, right?\n\n2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:23.320\n So there was no price transparency,\n\n2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:26.640\n there was no choice, you just got what you were given.\n\n2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:30.760\n So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry,\n\n2:13:30.760 --> 2:13:34.280\n that's why there was no innovation in it,\n\n2:13:34.280 --> 2:13:35.600\n because it was doing just fine\n\n2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:37.840\n because every house needed them.\n\n2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:42.840\n All the installers were programmed by the product deliverers,\n\n2:13:42.840 --> 2:13:48.840\n by bonuses to say, you're gonna only carry our product,\n\n2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:50.200\n and if you sell this many,\n\n2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:53.280\n you're gonna get a free trip to Hawaii, right?\n\n2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:54.440\n And for these guys who install,\n\n2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:57.840\n I get a free trip to Hawaii, that's dream for them, right?\n\n2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:00.320\n So this whole channel was fully controlled\n\n2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:01.560\n by the product guys,\n\n2:14:01.560 --> 2:14:03.680\n and it was almost monopolistic in a way.\n\n2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:06.760\n So how do you go around that?\n\n2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:10.840\n So creating a disruptive go to market channel,\n\n2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:13.000\n one was direct to consumer, right?\n\n2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:15.600\n And all the marketing that was necessary\n\n2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:17.800\n to get that message across.\n\n2:14:17.800 --> 2:14:20.800\n Another one was getting the installation right.\n\n2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:24.440\n No one was self installing thermostats.\n\n2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:27.280\n So how do we get enough people who are early adopters\n\n2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:30.600\n to be able to self install them confidently?\n\n2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:32.880\n So they didn't still have to call the guy\n\n2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:34.360\n to come and install it,\n\n2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:36.280\n because then he would say, this is a crap product.\n\n2:14:36.280 --> 2:14:38.360\n No, I got the most better product, right?\n\n2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.680\n So you had to get rid of that friction.\n\n2:14:40.680 --> 2:14:42.760\n And then ultimately, how do you get the people\n\n2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:44.360\n who were not just early adopters,\n\n2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:45.760\n but people who needed to see it\n\n2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:47.480\n and touch it before they bought it?\n\n2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:49.480\n How do you get that into retail\n\n2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:53.120\n when the large brands of the time of thermostats\n\n2:14:53.120 --> 2:14:55.640\n and Home Depot and Lowe's had contracts\n\n2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:58.440\n that they couldn't bring in any other brands?\n\n2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:00.320\n They were owning the channel all the way\n\n2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:04.200\n to where there was any sort of slight customer choice.\n\n2:15:04.200 --> 2:15:06.680\n And it was really contractor choice\n\n2:15:06.680 --> 2:15:09.280\n more than it was in consumer choice.\n\n2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:13.520\n So all of that had to be innovated along with the product.\n\n2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:15.440\n And so to me, that was a huge challenge\n\n2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:17.280\n and something I had never done,\n\n2:15:17.280 --> 2:15:18.440\n most of us had never done.\n\n2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:21.920\n And we had to create, that was as much as a project\n\n2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:24.560\n as actually delivering the product itself.\n\n2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:28.520\n So it turned out to be a giant hit.\n\n2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:33.520\n And it was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion.\n\n2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:36.640\n $3.2 billion.\n\n2:15:36.640 --> 2:15:39.640\n As a founder and leader, just out of curiosity,\n\n2:15:39.640 --> 2:15:44.640\n in these cases of acquisition, is it always a good thing?\n\n2:15:44.680 --> 2:15:47.560\n Is there any part of you and the team\n\n2:15:47.560 --> 2:15:49.920\n that considered saying no?\n\n2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:51.960\n Oh, we considered saying no\n\n2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:54.680\n all the way along the process, right?\n\n2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:56.640\n We'd all been in big companies before.\n\n2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:01.040\n We knew what it was like and the politics\n\n2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:04.520\n and all the other stuff and what I came to learn,\n\n2:16:04.520 --> 2:16:06.480\n especially from Phillips,\n\n2:16:06.480 --> 2:16:08.920\n because Phillips was a very, it was 375,000 people.\n\n2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:11.840\n It was a big, it was massive company, right?\n\n2:16:11.840 --> 2:16:13.360\n And tons of politics.\n\n2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:15.360\n And I was like, do we wanna go back into that world?\n\n2:16:15.360 --> 2:16:18.000\n Because I had so many negative experiences from that.\n\n2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:22.320\n But then going to Apple, which was not big,\n\n2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:24.680\n but it was big enough that it could have all these dynamics.\n\n2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:26.640\n But then when you saw a leader rise up\n\n2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:28.760\n and get rid of those dynamics or not,\n\n2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:31.400\n allow many of them to flourish,\n\n2:16:32.880 --> 2:16:35.000\n then you're like, oh, with the right leadership,\n\n2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:37.880\n this can be a beautiful marriage, right?\n\n2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:41.000\n And so for four months, we were working together with them,\n\n2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:43.960\n with Google, to make sure that we had the right leadership\n\n2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:45.640\n and we were gonna be in the right environment\n\n2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:46.760\n that it felt right.\n\n2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:49.120\n So that happened.\n\n2:16:49.120 --> 2:16:50.080\n It absolutely happened.\n\n2:16:50.080 --> 2:16:51.320\n We worked on all the details.\n\n2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:53.200\n We didn't even talk about price.\n\n2:16:53.200 --> 2:16:55.600\n We were talking about how's the brand gonna work?\n\n2:16:55.600 --> 2:16:56.760\n Who's the team gonna work with?\n\n2:16:56.760 --> 2:16:58.400\n How are we gonna get IP?\n\n2:16:58.400 --> 2:16:59.520\n How are we gonna do exchanges?\n\n2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:01.520\n How are we gonna get budgets and all that stuff done?\n\n2:17:01.520 --> 2:17:02.520\n So we worked through all of that\n\n2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:04.360\n before we actually sealed any kind of deal\n\n2:17:04.360 --> 2:17:05.840\n because they were already an investor in the company.\n\n2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:07.400\n So we already knew,\n\n2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:12.040\n they knew relatively where the end point was for the price.\n\n2:17:12.040 --> 2:17:14.320\n So working through all of those prerequisites,\n\n2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:20.160\n I knew that as a individual product company\n\n2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:22.840\n that was trying to create a platform,\n\n2:17:22.840 --> 2:17:25.160\n no investors were gonna invest in a platform\n\n2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:27.480\n that could take three, four years\n\n2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:30.360\n and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to build\n\n2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:33.720\n without all kinds of new products at the same time.\n\n2:17:33.720 --> 2:17:35.960\n And products that we were having, which were successes,\n\n2:17:35.960 --> 2:17:37.600\n but they weren't even break even yet, right?\n\n2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:39.440\n We were still developing them.\n\n2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:42.000\n So how are we gonna get more people to fund\n\n2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.120\n all of these things and this platform\n\n2:17:44.120 --> 2:17:46.080\n that I really wanna create?\n\n2:17:46.080 --> 2:17:48.200\n Because my worry, and I had seen this many times\n\n2:17:48.200 --> 2:17:51.200\n in Silicon Valley, is these small startups have bravado\n\n2:17:51.200 --> 2:17:54.600\n and they said, I'm gonna take on the big guys, right?\n\n2:17:54.600 --> 2:17:55.720\n With a platform.\n\n2:17:55.720 --> 2:17:57.960\n But when those platform guys show up\n\n2:17:57.960 --> 2:17:59.840\n and Apple says they're gonna get in the,\n\n2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:01.680\n at the time, nobody cared.\n\n2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:04.880\n They were curious, what's next?\n\n2:18:04.880 --> 2:18:07.040\n But Apple wasn't in the market,\n\n2:18:07.040 --> 2:18:09.080\n Google wasn't in the market yet,\n\n2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:12.080\n Amazon wasn't there, Microsoft, Samsung,\n\n2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:16.000\n they were all just, that's curious, right?\n\n2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:19.000\n And I had watched, if you said,\n\n2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:20.720\n I'm gonna go challenge them\n\n2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:22.520\n and I'm gonna build a platform,\n\n2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:24.400\n and then they all of a sudden one by one go,\n\n2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:26.200\n oh, well, we're building a platform now,\n\n2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.120\n we're building a platform.\n\n2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:29.920\n They flooded you to death, fear, uncertainty, doubt,\n\n2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:31.320\n and the developers run away\n\n2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:32.360\n and you can't make that platform.\n\n2:18:32.360 --> 2:18:35.720\n So I'm like, before the landscape gets changed on us,\n\n2:18:35.720 --> 2:18:37.240\n because we've tracked so much attention,\n\n2:18:37.240 --> 2:18:38.280\n they announced something,\n\n2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:41.640\n we need to change the landscape on them.\n\n2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:44.400\n Let's go to the best place\n\n2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:46.400\n where we can build out the platform,\n\n2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:48.680\n have the right leadership behind us\n\n2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:51.760\n to help us grow this thing into what the vision it should be.\n\n2:18:51.760 --> 2:18:53.480\n And that's what we believed we were doing\n\n2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:55.920\n with the Google acquisition.\n\n2:18:55.920 --> 2:19:00.040\n Is it possible to take on the platforms?\n\n2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:01.920\n So you said there's a lot of startups\n\n2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:04.200\n with bravado and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:07.240\n It doesn't mean, James Joyce, when he was 20,\n\n2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:09.360\n he said, I'm gonna be the greatest writer\n\n2:19:09.360 --> 2:19:14.360\n of the 20th century before he wrote anything of value.\n\n2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:17.040\n One of them might be actually right.\n\n2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:21.400\n Yeah, in this modern world,\n\n2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:24.440\n when you, so first of all, people should definitely\n\n2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:30.440\n get your book built as just this giant number of advice\n\n2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:36.320\n on this exact question of how to build cool things,\n\n2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:37.800\n how to build a startup,\n\n2:19:37.800 --> 2:19:41.720\n how to all the different stages of that team and hiring.\n\n2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:43.080\n It's mostly human nature.\n\n2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:44.080\n It's not technical.\n\n2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.360\n It's mostly human nature behind it.\n\n2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:48.440\n And it turns out it's,\n\n2:19:48.440 --> 2:19:51.160\n turtles all the way down this human at the bottom.\n\n2:19:51.160 --> 2:19:56.160\n Yes, so is it possible to build startups\n\n2:19:56.240 --> 2:19:58.760\n that take on the big guys,\n\n2:19:58.760 --> 2:20:01.160\n whatever that is of the modern era?\n\n2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:05.440\n So for now, it's these platforms of Apple, Google, Twitter,\n\n2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:08.560\n I don't even know, Meta I guess called now.\n\n2:20:09.560 --> 2:20:11.360\n Is it possible to take them on?\n\n2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:15.240\n Absolutely, but you don't take them on on their same turf.\n\n2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:16.400\n You take them on on the turf\n\n2:20:16.400 --> 2:20:20.040\n they're gonna want to have in the future, right?\n\n2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:21.560\n Spotify is a platform.\n\n2:20:21.560 --> 2:20:26.000\n It started as an application, is now a platform, right?\n\n2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:27.240\n Think of WeChat.\n\n2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:30.320\n Think of all the super apps out there\n\n2:20:30.320 --> 2:20:33.560\n that are now wallets and delivery services\n\n2:20:33.560 --> 2:20:37.240\n and travel services and transportation services\n\n2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:39.320\n all within an app.\n\n2:20:39.320 --> 2:20:40.880\n They've innovated in a different level,\n\n2:20:40.880 --> 2:20:44.000\n in a different space that the platform companies weren't.\n\n2:20:46.040 --> 2:20:49.440\n Google was an app company.\n\n2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.120\n It was solving search.\n\n2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:52.960\n And then it became a platform company.\n\n2:20:52.960 --> 2:20:55.200\n Apple was solving personal computing.\n\n2:20:55.200 --> 2:21:00.200\n And then iPhone was solving internet browsing,\n\n2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:01.680\n all that stuff.\n\n2:21:01.680 --> 2:21:03.120\n And then it became a platform company\n\n2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:04.400\n when the app store was at it.\n\n2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:05.720\n If you look at it,\n\n2:21:05.720 --> 2:21:07.640\n there's no such thing as building a platform company.\n\n2:21:07.640 --> 2:21:09.880\n You build a great app first,\n\n2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:11.160\n and then you can expand it\n\n2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:13.160\n and have the right to become a platform.\n\n2:21:14.840 --> 2:21:19.200\n Your whole book is just a bunch of advice for young people.\n\n2:21:19.200 --> 2:21:20.040\n But let me ask.\n\n2:21:20.040 --> 2:21:20.920\n And older people.\n\n2:21:20.920 --> 2:21:23.200\n And old, well, everyone is young at heart.\n\n2:21:23.200 --> 2:21:25.280\n And if you're not, you should be.\n\n2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:28.120\n So what, in terms of picking a career,\n\n2:21:28.120 --> 2:21:29.720\n you have advice on this point.\n\n2:21:29.720 --> 2:21:32.400\n What advice would you give to a person\n\n2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:34.160\n on how to pick a career?\n\n2:21:35.120 --> 2:21:37.320\n What is it you want to learn?\n\n2:21:37.320 --> 2:21:39.360\n And who is it you want to learn from?\n\n2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:41.080\n Just like you pick a university.\n\n2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:44.840\n You're like, I wanna go here for this expertise.\n\n2:21:44.840 --> 2:21:47.720\n I've heard about these programs, especially graduate,\n\n2:21:47.720 --> 2:21:51.080\n graduate studies, you go for a certain program\n\n2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:52.640\n with a certain set of people.\n\n2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:56.440\n Why don't you do that when it comes to a job?\n\n2:21:56.440 --> 2:21:58.400\n You just don't go, or in a career,\n\n2:21:58.400 --> 2:21:59.280\n you just don't go and say,\n\n2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:00.880\n I just wanna go work at Google,\n\n2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:02.440\n or I just wanna work at Apple.\n\n2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:04.240\n You wanna go to a certain team\n\n2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:05.720\n with a certain set of people\n\n2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:07.240\n and work with them on something\n\n2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:08.920\n that you're really curious about\n\n2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:10.440\n and you wanna learn about.\n\n2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:12.960\n That's such, I just wanted to comment that,\n\n2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:17.080\n that's such a, it's a subtle but a brilliant framing\n\n2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:21.160\n of just ask the question, what do I want to learn?\n\n2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:27.240\n And then see what career path is going to maximize that.\n\n2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:31.000\n That's so interesting.\n\n2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:34.040\n It's the first question I ask anyone who interviews with me.\n\n2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:36.680\n When I say I'm gonna bring somebody on the team,\n\n2:22:36.680 --> 2:22:39.560\n first question is, what do you wanna learn?\n\n2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:41.840\n I don't want the expert, like we talked about earlier,\n\n2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:43.560\n says, I'm the expert in this.\n\n2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:46.040\n You're gonna hire me as the expert.\n\n2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:47.600\n We're doing something new.\n\n2:22:47.600 --> 2:22:48.440\n You're not an expert,\n\n2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:50.120\n cause we're not an expert either.\n\n2:22:50.120 --> 2:22:51.520\n What is it you wanna learn?\n\n2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:58.520\n And on the topic of learning,\n\n2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:00.600\n what is the best way to learn?\n\n2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:06.840\n What, starting, you go into this new place,\n\n2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:10.640\n into this new world, into maybe V1,\n\n2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:12.200\n you said you're building V1.\n\n2:23:12.200 --> 2:23:17.000\n I mean, the whole world is late, is full of V1s\n\n2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.320\n or V0s waiting for the V1 to come along.\n\n2:23:20.320 --> 2:23:21.160\n Zero to one.\n\n2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:22.120\n Zero to one.\n\n2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:25.520\n What's the process of that look like?\n\n2:23:25.520 --> 2:23:27.080\n What's the process of learning?\n\n2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:29.840\n How do you learn?\n\n2:23:29.840 --> 2:23:31.680\n Well, let me put a framing\n\n2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:34.480\n and then we'll talk about that last piece.\n\n2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:37.960\n I have now looking back, especially writing this book,\n\n2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:40.880\n I have a version one of myself, a version two,\n\n2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:43.320\n a version three, a version four.\n\n2:23:43.320 --> 2:23:46.640\n I had a lot of opinions about myself\n\n2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:47.480\n and what I wanted to do.\n\n2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:50.240\n Sometimes those opinions for certain people,\n\n2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:52.080\n those opinions are formed\n\n2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:54.080\n and they get the data from their parents\n\n2:23:54.080 --> 2:23:55.800\n and they go do what their parents told them to do\n\n2:23:55.800 --> 2:23:57.400\n or their surroundings.\n\n2:23:57.400 --> 2:23:59.600\n My opinions was like, I wanna go and learn this.\n\n2:23:59.600 --> 2:24:00.520\n I'm curious about that.\n\n2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:02.440\n I made the zero to one move.\n\n2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:05.280\n And then over time by doing,\n\n2:24:05.280 --> 2:24:06.920\n I was refining those things\n\n2:24:06.920 --> 2:24:08.520\n and learning what I was really curious about\n\n2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:10.240\n and what I was really good about\n\n2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:11.760\n because I was getting data.\n\n2:24:11.760 --> 2:24:14.240\n And then I was like, then I had another set of opinions\n\n2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:16.480\n to create version two of me.\n\n2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:17.520\n And then I would go and do it.\n\n2:24:17.520 --> 2:24:19.800\n So I was learning by doing,\n\n2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:21.040\n starting with the opinion,\n\n2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:22.560\n you're not gonna get any facts.\n\n2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:24.160\n Most people are like,\n\n2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:27.200\n where do I make the most money for my position?\n\n2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:28.840\n They're trying to start with data.\n\n2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:33.760\n Start with the why, what's your curiosity?\n\n2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:35.440\n What do you wanna learn?\n\n2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:37.320\n And then follow that.\n\n2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:42.320\n I took the lowest job on the totem pole at General Magic\n\n2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:43.520\n because I wanted to get in there\n\n2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:44.840\n to work with the right team.\n\n2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:47.600\n I didn't even know what they were doing, right?\n\n2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:50.320\n But I thought that it felt right, right?\n\n2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:54.080\n I was barely living above the poverty line working there,\n\n2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:55.640\n working 80 hours a week\n\n2:24:55.640 --> 2:24:57.840\n because it was so amazing to learn\n\n2:24:57.840 --> 2:24:59.280\n just like a college student, right?\n\n2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:00.800\n That's what I was doing.\n\n2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:03.720\n And then I learned more from that\n\n2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:06.120\n and then changed those opinions into data.\n\n2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:07.800\n And then I found other opinions.\n\n2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:11.760\n So it's the same thing, but it was by doing, right?\n\n2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:13.720\n The way you find out what you wanna do in life\n\n2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:16.480\n is by figuring out what you don't wanna do.\n\n2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:17.960\n And the only way you find that out\n\n2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:19.320\n is by doing a bunch of stuff.\n\n2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:21.760\n Doing a bunch of stuff and refining it.\n\n2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:22.720\n That's hilarious.\n\n2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:23.880\n Yeah, that's brilliant.\n\n2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:27.200\n So in terms of the career path\n\n2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:31.520\n of leaping into the startup world and launching a startup,\n\n2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:35.280\n what does it take to successfully found a startup,\n\n2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:37.760\n to have a chance to succeed?\n\n2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:42.760\n And maybe how do you decide to take that leap?\n\n2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:49.200\n Is there sort of having founded,\n\n2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:52.640\n having been part of many V1s,\n\n2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:55.640\n many of some of the most successful V1s ever,\n\n2:25:57.080 --> 2:25:58.880\n what's it take to take that leap?\n\n2:25:58.880 --> 2:26:03.880\n Maybe leave your job, cushy job at a company\n\n2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:06.400\n and do the startup.\n\n2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:07.320\n What does it take?\n\n2:26:08.680 --> 2:26:10.800\n It takes belief in yourself.\n\n2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:12.320\n That's the first thing.\n\n2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:13.560\n Belief that you can do it.\n\n2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:17.520\n Not, but hopefully with mirrors or mentors around you\n\n2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:19.480\n or coaches around you to make sure you know\n\n2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:21.280\n you're not crazy.\n\n2:26:21.280 --> 2:26:24.000\n It's a crazy smart idea, but you're not crazy\n\n2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.040\n and you're just working on something\n\n2:26:26.040 --> 2:26:28.960\n as like a lone mad man or woman.\n\n2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:32.840\n You have a great idea.\n\n2:26:32.840 --> 2:26:34.800\n And like I said, great ideas chase you.\n\n2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:39.520\n In this world, there are so many people who have more ideas\n\n2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:41.680\n than they have time to implement.\n\n2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:42.920\n I used to be like that.\n\n2:26:42.920 --> 2:26:44.800\n I would like, oh my God, if this idea, this idea,\n\n2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:47.360\n and you try to do all of them,\n\n2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:50.240\n but the best ideas are the ones that you can really focus on\n\n2:26:50.240 --> 2:26:52.240\n and you shut out all those other things\n\n2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:53.360\n and you bring them other ideas\n\n2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:54.920\n into the thing you're trying to do.\n\n2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:58.040\n So I try to run away from a great idea\n\n2:26:58.040 --> 2:26:59.920\n and then it stalks me.\n\n2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:01.840\n It hunts you down because you're like,\n\n2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:03.520\n ah, that's gonna have this problem.\n\n2:27:03.520 --> 2:27:05.280\n I'm gonna put it aside.\n\n2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:08.720\n And then all of a sudden, you know, a few days later,\n\n2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:10.480\n oh, I think I know how to solve that problem.\n\n2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:13.520\n Or I talk to somebody and you're just always kind of\n\n2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:15.440\n niggling around the edges of it.\n\n2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:17.160\n And then at some point it's like,\n\n2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:19.720\n it just becomes like this black hole\n\n2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:20.920\n that just sucks you in and you're like,\n\n2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:23.280\n I can't think about anything else but this.\n\n2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:26.360\n It's almost like a relationship in the world, right?\n\n2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:29.560\n You know, when you have it with a, you find your partner.\n\n2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:33.080\n You know, you're like, mm, mm, wait, mm, something.\n\n2:27:33.080 --> 2:27:34.120\n And then you're trying to like,\n\n2:27:34.120 --> 2:27:35.720\n and then all of a sudden it just,\n\n2:27:35.720 --> 2:27:36.760\n it comes together, right?\n\n2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:37.760\n It's kind of like that.\n\n2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:38.960\n Ultimately achieved focus.\n\n2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:39.880\n See, I'm different.\n\n2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:41.240\n I just dive right in.\n\n2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:42.240\n I used to do that too.\n\n2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:43.600\n I used to dive right in.\n\n2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:44.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:45.680\n But I learned that you'd need time.\n\n2:27:45.680 --> 2:27:47.280\n It's more effective to run away from it.\n\n2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:48.240\n Run away from it.\n\n2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:51.320\n And so it chases you because it makes you think harder\n\n2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:52.480\n about that story.\n\n2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:53.880\n This is not dating advice.\n\n2:27:53.880 --> 2:27:54.880\n We're talking about stardom.\n\n2:27:54.880 --> 2:27:57.720\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:27:57.720 --> 2:28:02.720\n But ultimately, so you have achieved a focus on it.\n\n2:28:03.080 --> 2:28:05.360\n But you also said to believe in yourself.\n\n2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:06.880\n So it's not necessarily even the idea.\n\n2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.880\n It's the human that believe in the human being.\n\n2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:15.560\n You have to believe in yourself and the idea that you have.\n\n2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.800\n Because if you don't have that belief,\n\n2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:20.440\n then you can't project that to other people\n\n2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:21.720\n to say, join the team.\n\n2:28:24.120 --> 2:28:26.880\n Let me ask you on, because you mentioned mentors\n\n2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:30.120\n and you've talked about having had incredible mentors\n\n2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:30.960\n in your life.\n\n2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:34.600\n You're also a mentor to a very large number of people.\n\n2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:36.520\n What does it take to find a mentor?\n\n2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:39.200\n How do you find a great mentor?\n\n2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:41.720\n Usually they also find you.\n\n2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:44.320\n Is it like with the ideas?\n\n2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:46.800\n No, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:48.880\n No, what happens is you're in the right,\n\n2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:51.040\n you have a community around you, okay?\n\n2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:53.680\n And because you've been building a network,\n\n2:28:53.680 --> 2:28:55.080\n because you can't do it alone.\n\n2:28:55.080 --> 2:28:57.600\n So you have to create this network around you\n\n2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:00.200\n of relationships, not transactions,\n\n2:29:00.200 --> 2:29:02.800\n but relationships over time that you really cherish\n\n2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:04.880\n and people you talk to, okay?\n\n2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:09.520\n And you share vulnerable or nascent ideas with\n\n2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:13.320\n or crazy opinions with, and then you argue them through.\n\n2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:18.320\n But you start to see resonate, and it's not about age.\n\n2:29:18.360 --> 2:29:20.600\n It's just about this connection, right?\n\n2:29:20.600 --> 2:29:21.840\n I have mentors.\n\n2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:23.920\n Obviously when I was young, all my mentors were older.\n\n2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:27.200\n And as I get older, I have mentors who are younger than me\n\n2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:28.560\n or the same age, right?\n\n2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:30.240\n They're not all just older, right?\n\n2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:32.360\n And so it's about that connection.\n\n2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:35.000\n It's about being on that same wavelength,\n\n2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.120\n but they also, they can counterbalance you.\n\n2:29:39.120 --> 2:29:41.120\n They compliment you in some way.\n\n2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:43.720\n Like my best mentors had nothing to do with technology.\n\n2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:46.600\n They didn't know anything about technology, right?\n\n2:29:46.600 --> 2:29:47.720\n The way we know it.\n\n2:29:47.720 --> 2:29:49.840\n They were all about human nature and they could reflect that\n\n2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:53.440\n and help me get more human focused and more empathetic\n\n2:29:53.440 --> 2:29:56.440\n because I was so detailed in the technology.\n\n2:29:56.440 --> 2:29:58.760\n I needed to see from other perspectives,\n\n2:29:58.760 --> 2:30:01.120\n but then they wanted to learn more about the technology,\n\n2:30:01.120 --> 2:30:01.960\n right?\n\n2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:03.280\n Or they thought that this idea was so great\n\n2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:04.760\n that it should exist.\n\n2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:06.640\n Now let's work together on that.\n\n2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:08.880\n So it's really, they have to find you\n\n2:30:08.880 --> 2:30:10.040\n and you have to find them.\n\n2:30:10.040 --> 2:30:11.640\n And that's by sharing.\n\n2:30:11.640 --> 2:30:14.840\n You just don't go and look it up on the internet\n\n2:30:14.840 --> 2:30:16.680\n and say, who are the best mentors in the world?\n\n2:30:16.680 --> 2:30:18.560\n It just doesn't work that way.\n\n2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:21.120\n So form a network of people and see where,\n\n2:30:21.120 --> 2:30:23.960\n I mean, it's like finding relationships, finding love,\n\n2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:24.800\n all that kind of friendship.\n\n2:30:24.800 --> 2:30:25.640\n Human nature.\n\n2:30:27.640 --> 2:30:29.800\n Venture capitalists, money.\n\n2:30:29.800 --> 2:30:33.360\n Do VCs help or hurt a business in general?\n\n2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:35.600\n So like in those early stages in the chase\n\n2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.760\n of developing a V1, just what's the constructive\n\n2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:42.840\n and destructive power of money\n\n2:30:42.840 --> 2:30:45.280\n in the development of a brilliant idea\n\n2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:47.600\n and the deployment of a brilliant idea?\n\n2:30:47.600 --> 2:30:50.720\n I have seen brilliant venture capitalists.\n\n2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:53.440\n I have seen horrible ones.\n\n2:30:53.440 --> 2:30:56.080\n Ones that care about their LPs more\n\n2:30:56.080 --> 2:30:58.800\n than they care about the entrepreneurs.\n\n2:30:58.800 --> 2:31:01.200\n Of course, everyone's in it, at the end of the day,\n\n2:31:01.200 --> 2:31:03.720\n especially venture capital, they have to give a return\n\n2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:07.040\n to their limited partners, the people who invest in money\n\n2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:09.560\n that they have to shepherd that money\n\n2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:12.160\n and make sure it's watched over properly.\n\n2:31:12.160 --> 2:31:14.760\n But when there's not a balance, a pushback\n\n2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:17.400\n in a venture capitalist between what the LPs\n\n2:31:17.400 --> 2:31:20.880\n needs and what the entrepreneur needs,\n\n2:31:20.880 --> 2:31:23.480\n and that the entrepreneur might be trying really hard,\n\n2:31:23.480 --> 2:31:25.880\n but if they don't see, the VC doesn't see,\n\n2:31:25.880 --> 2:31:27.320\n the exit's gonna happen in two years\n\n2:31:27.320 --> 2:31:29.840\n and they just leave them hanging,\n\n2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:33.200\n when there's no, the value exchange is only money\n\n2:31:33.200 --> 2:31:36.760\n and not mentorship or ideas or other things,\n\n2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:40.320\n when there's not a relationship, but really a transaction,\n\n2:31:40.320 --> 2:31:43.120\n that's when money is toxic.\n\n2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:44.400\n Because you can get money everywhere.\n\n2:31:44.400 --> 2:31:46.520\n Maybe it's a little harder today,\n\n2:31:46.520 --> 2:31:49.840\n over the last month, but you can still find people\n\n2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.480\n with money who are on that, who wanna enable your mission\n\n2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:57.960\n and can be mentors, not always, not all of them,\n\n2:31:57.960 --> 2:32:01.480\n but some of them can be mentors, but they're on your side,\n\n2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:03.440\n then it's incredibly powerful\n\n2:32:03.440 --> 2:32:06.040\n because it's not just one plus one equals two, right?\n\n2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:07.560\n It's something bigger than that\n\n2:32:07.560 --> 2:32:09.720\n because then they can bring their networks of people\n\n2:32:09.720 --> 2:32:11.240\n and their networks of companies\n\n2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:12.640\n and other people they worked with\n\n2:32:12.640 --> 2:32:17.120\n that might wanna join your mission, right?\n\n2:32:17.120 --> 2:32:19.280\n That's the kind of venture capitalist\n\n2:32:19.280 --> 2:32:22.080\n and smart money that's out there, right?\n\n2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:23.960\n But you have to build a relationship.\n\n2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:26.040\n People go, oh, look at that valuation.\n\n2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:29.840\n Oh, it's the brand name of the VC that's investing me.\n\n2:32:29.840 --> 2:32:32.840\n No, it boils down to who's that partner\n\n2:32:32.840 --> 2:32:34.640\n and how experienced are they?\n\n2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:37.720\n Don't just give me the brand, give me the person\n\n2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:40.040\n because that's the person I'm gonna be interacting with.\n\n2:32:40.040 --> 2:32:42.600\n I have to, there's a million questions I wanna ask you,\n\n2:32:42.600 --> 2:32:46.720\n but we're on season five already.\n\n2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:49.120\n But let me ask you, it seems like\n\n2:32:50.200 --> 2:32:51.680\n out of all the brilliant things you write about,\n\n2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:53.040\n it seems like not an important question,\n\n2:32:53.040 --> 2:32:55.240\n but it's a fascinating one to me as lawyers.\n\n2:32:55.240 --> 2:32:56.240\n You write about this.\n\n2:32:56.240 --> 2:33:01.240\n So does the company need lawyers and why?\n\n2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:04.440\n And what kind?\n\n2:33:04.440 --> 2:33:07.800\n So you write about sort of the value of this game, I guess.\n\n2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:09.680\n Right, the legal game.\n\n2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:10.520\n It's...\n\n2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:14.600\n Why do we need lawyers?\n\n2:33:14.600 --> 2:33:16.120\n You sound exasperated by lawyers.\n\n2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:18.120\n I don't have a good question, I guess.\n\n2:33:19.200 --> 2:33:20.040\n Well, because...\n\n2:33:20.040 --> 2:33:21.320\n The why of lawyers is what you're asking.\n\n2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:23.160\n The why of lawyers, yes, exactly.\n\n2:33:23.160 --> 2:33:25.000\n Okay, the why of lawyers.\n\n2:33:25.000 --> 2:33:26.360\n Thank you.\n\n2:33:26.360 --> 2:33:27.600\n You even do the question.\n\n2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:32.000\n We just have to put why in front of everything you ask\n\n2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:33.200\n and then we'll be there.\n\n2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:34.840\n Lawyers, why, why?\n\n2:33:34.840 --> 2:33:37.040\n Even mafiosos had lawyers.\n\n2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:42.040\n Okay, you know, Tony Soprano, you know, Scarface,\n\n2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:46.920\n all of them had lawyers, right?\n\n2:33:46.920 --> 2:33:47.880\n Why?\n\n2:33:47.880 --> 2:33:49.640\n Because there are things in this world\n\n2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:53.240\n that you don't always consider in the government,\n\n2:33:53.240 --> 2:33:57.960\n in laws, in competitors,\n\n2:33:57.960 --> 2:34:00.280\n because you're so focused on what you're doing,\n\n2:34:00.280 --> 2:34:02.760\n they have to watch out for you, right?\n\n2:34:03.600 --> 2:34:05.640\n Now, the best kind of lawyers are the ones\n\n2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:08.920\n who try to work with you to enable what you're doing\n\n2:34:08.920 --> 2:34:11.600\n and see gray areas.\n\n2:34:11.600 --> 2:34:15.280\n Law is not black or white, it's how it's interpreted, right?\n\n2:34:15.280 --> 2:34:17.600\n And so they can help interpret things a certain way\n\n2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:19.960\n or help push on things a certain way\n\n2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:22.400\n to get change to happen or allow change to happen.\n\n2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:24.040\n Because if you have lawyers who are always,\n\n2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:26.440\n just like you were talking about PR people,\n\n2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:28.280\n if you have lawyers who are always saying no to everything,\n\n2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:30.720\n because their job is to really say no or maybe,\n\n2:34:30.720 --> 2:34:32.600\n they'll never say yes.\n\n2:34:32.600 --> 2:34:35.040\n And you also say their job is to say no\n\n2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:36.280\n and bill you by the hour.\n\n2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:38.320\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:39.160\n Depressing.\n\n2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:40.240\n Right?\n\n2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:41.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:42.320\n If you don't wanna know, don't ask them,\n\n2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:43.360\n because you're gonna get a no,\n\n2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:44.200\n maybe a maybe.\n\n2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:45.040\n And you'll get charged for it.\n\n2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:47.640\n And you'll get charged for it anyways, right?\n\n2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:52.360\n So to have a partner, to have them on your team,\n\n2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:55.000\n to help you see maybe some of the things you don't see,\n\n2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.200\n some consequences, they help to rein that in\n\n2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:00.120\n or change your language.\n\n2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:02.240\n Like, are you gonna get sued for this ad?\n\n2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:05.000\n Just change this one word and it helps.\n\n2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:06.040\n Right?\n\n2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:07.720\n So you need to have a partner.\n\n2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:10.840\n Most of the times, especially engineers or designers,\n\n2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:12.680\n they see lawyers as only stifling.\n\n2:35:13.800 --> 2:35:15.400\n Lawyers can actually, if you do it right\n\n2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:16.640\n and you have the right type,\n\n2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:19.000\n they can actually open up a whole new world for you\n\n2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:20.520\n because of the interpretation\n\n2:35:20.520 --> 2:35:22.840\n and how we go about doing things.\n\n2:35:22.840 --> 2:35:23.680\n So.\n\n2:35:23.680 --> 2:35:25.520\n And they help you not get bogged down\n\n2:35:25.520 --> 2:35:28.480\n in the pain of little mistakes that didn't mean anything.\n\n2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:29.800\n Exactly, you shot yourself in the foot\n\n2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:30.640\n and you didn't even know it.\n\n2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:33.600\n You didn't even know you were carrying the gun.\n\n2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:36.720\n Just to jump around, Charles Bukowski once wrote,\n\n2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:39.760\n \"'Find what you love and let it kill you.'\"\n\n2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:44.120\n So the question is about work life balance.\n\n2:35:44.120 --> 2:35:46.560\n That's like finding an idea and let it chase you.\n\n2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:48.600\n Yes, but a little more aggressive.\n\n2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:54.320\n So what does work life balance look like\n\n2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:59.320\n that maximizes success and or happiness?\n\n2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:02.400\n Is there such a thing as work life balance?\n\n2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:05.640\n Is, can you speak to this?\n\n2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:07.320\n When your work is your life,\n\n2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:10.160\n and I mean that in the positive sense.\n\n2:36:10.160 --> 2:36:12.960\n When you're on a mission that really matters\n\n2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:15.880\n and you know that you can really affect,\n\n2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:18.040\n not just yourself, but other people's lives,\n\n2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:21.360\n and then that is very rewarding, right?\n\n2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:23.240\n That's not work.\n\n2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:25.240\n That's, like I said, a mission, right?\n\n2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:27.320\n You adopt that.\n\n2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:30.200\n But that said, you still need to have boundaries yourself.\n\n2:36:30.200 --> 2:36:32.240\n At General Magic, wonderful documentary,\n\n2:36:32.240 --> 2:36:34.040\n if no one's seen it, you gotta see that.\n\n2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:35.160\n It's amazing.\n\n2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:37.320\n I was physically and mentally unhealthy,\n\n2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:38.760\n socially unhealthy as well,\n\n2:36:38.760 --> 2:36:42.120\n because I put every waking minute into this thing,\n\n2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:44.680\n every ounce of me into it.\n\n2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:48.920\n And when it was a spectacular disaster,\n\n2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:51.160\n we were making the iPhone 15 years too early,\n\n2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:54.040\n the bottom fell out.\n\n2:36:54.040 --> 2:36:55.720\n I had nothing left.\n\n2:36:55.720 --> 2:36:59.840\n I had to get healthy socially, emotionally, physically\n\n2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:03.240\n after that, that trauma.\n\n2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:04.520\n I let everything go.\n\n2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:06.920\n I learned from that that you have to,\n\n2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:09.560\n even though you might put everything into your work,\n\n2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:11.880\n you need to find balance outside of it.\n\n2:37:11.880 --> 2:37:14.320\n Now that doesn't mean you're always,\n\n2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:16.960\n you know, it's three days a week working\n\n2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:19.160\n and four days a week or whatever it was.\n\n2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:21.240\n You're still working as hard as ever,\n\n2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:23.320\n but what you're doing is you're making sure\n\n2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:26.080\n when your thinking time is during work,\n\n2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:28.160\n that you're not ruminating at three in the morning.\n\n2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:31.360\n You use the tools that you have to put those ideas\n\n2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:34.280\n into databases or on pages or somewhere else\n\n2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:36.560\n so you can go back and look at them.\n\n2:37:36.560 --> 2:37:37.960\n So you're not always having to remember,\n\n2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:39.000\n because what happens is most people\n\n2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:40.400\n don't write this stuff down.\n\n2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:41.880\n So they just sit here and got to remember this,\n\n2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:43.920\n I got to remember this, I got to remember this.\n\n2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:45.520\n If you just put it into the tools\n\n2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:48.080\n and you can come back to it, you can come back fresh.\n\n2:37:48.080 --> 2:37:49.720\n A lot of the time is about ruminating\n\n2:37:49.720 --> 2:37:52.760\n about what I need to get done and remembering everything\n\n2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:54.360\n instead of doing the work.\n\n2:37:55.520 --> 2:37:56.440\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:58.480\n So if you just put it down on paper,\n\n2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:00.320\n you can actually escape it.\n\n2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:03.160\n Escape it for a time, to have peace for a time.\n\n2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:08.160\n You mentioned General Magic.\n\n2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:10.600\n Let me ask you the Russian question.\n\n2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:13.200\n The Russian question.\n\n2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:18.200\n What's been the darkest moments of your life?\n\n2:38:20.160 --> 2:38:21.600\n Where are some of the darkest places\n\n2:38:21.600 --> 2:38:22.840\n you've got in your mind?\n\n2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:26.000\n You talked about if you're doing these kinds of things\n\n2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.920\n with startups, you're gonna have to face a crisis.\n\n2:38:28.920 --> 2:38:29.760\n Right, absolutely.\n\n2:38:29.760 --> 2:38:31.360\n If you're doing it right, you're gonna face it.\n\n2:38:31.360 --> 2:38:34.000\n So for you personally, where were some\n\n2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:37.400\n of the tougher moments in your life?\n\n2:38:37.400 --> 2:38:42.160\n Growing up, I went to 12 schools in 15 years.\n\n2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:45.360\n I was always the new kid.\n\n2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:49.240\n Put yourself in those shoes, right?\n\n2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:51.400\n You picked on, what were you picked on?\n\n2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:53.600\n Well, absolutely, but even more so,\n\n2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:55.680\n I was the geek with the computer.\n\n2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:57.320\n Remember the nerds in the 80s?\n\n2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:59.520\n You probably don't know this, but believe me,\n\n2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:01.160\n we were made fun of.\n\n2:39:01.160 --> 2:39:02.800\n What were these computers?\n\n2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:03.640\n What were these things?\n\n2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:04.920\n You're off in a cold.\n\n2:39:04.920 --> 2:39:07.400\n They're all off partying or going, whatever it was,\n\n2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:09.280\n and I'm sitting there like,\n\n2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:12.480\n and they're like, this guy is just this alien, right?\n\n2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:15.040\n Who's this new guy who just showed up and,\n\n2:39:15.040 --> 2:39:17.960\n and then you would ask the smart questions\n\n2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:20.280\n and you couldn't be the smartest in the,\n\n2:39:20.280 --> 2:39:22.560\n because then you get picked on too.\n\n2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:23.680\n And you're the new kid.\n\n2:39:23.680 --> 2:39:26.280\n So you're in this environment that's ever changing.\n\n2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:29.800\n You don't fit in and you are just asking questions\n\n2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:32.480\n because you think they're the right questions to answer,\n\n2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:34.440\n but then they like, you're making us look bad.\n\n2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:35.520\n Don't ask these smart questions\n\n2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:37.200\n because you're gonna make us do more work.\n\n2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:40.560\n So right there, it's pretty tough.\n\n2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:41.800\n And I'm moving cities, right?\n\n2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:42.800\n And I didn't have the internet\n\n2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:44.080\n to stay connected to people.\n\n2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:45.920\n There was no internet.\n\n2:39:45.920 --> 2:39:47.640\n Phone calls were $2 a minute.\n\n2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:49.280\n So it was lonely too.\n\n2:39:49.280 --> 2:39:51.680\n It was lonely, right?\n\n2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:52.520\n Right?\n\n2:39:52.520 --> 2:39:54.840\n I was a latchkey kid, right?\n\n2:39:54.840 --> 2:39:56.880\n I had my brother, but he was a skateboarder\n\n2:39:56.880 --> 2:40:00.640\n and he had a different social way of working.\n\n2:40:00.640 --> 2:40:02.400\n He loved to do that stuff and be outside.\n\n2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:03.480\n I loved the computer.\n\n2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:06.600\n So even in the computer, you were alone in the family.\n\n2:40:06.600 --> 2:40:09.000\n With the computer in the family, you were alone.\n\n2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:09.840\n I was absolutely alone.\n\n2:40:09.840 --> 2:40:10.680\n That was just me.\n\n2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:15.240\n But then, then you could find the other geeks, right?\n\n2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:16.480\n But there were just a few of us\n\n2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:18.480\n and we made this little thing.\n\n2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:20.040\n But then when you moved away,\n\n2:40:20.040 --> 2:40:22.400\n you know, then I had to use a BBS\n\n2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:24.960\n and a bulletin board system and a dial up modem.\n\n2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:27.960\n And then I started hacking the phone system\n\n2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:32.000\n to get free codes on MCI and Sprint back in the day\n\n2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:35.160\n to get long distance, to get free codes to call my friends,\n\n2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:37.120\n the geeks on the other side, right?\n\n2:40:37.120 --> 2:40:39.320\n Or to dial into a BBS cheaply\n\n2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.200\n that was in another part of the world.\n\n2:40:41.200 --> 2:40:43.600\n So this was this subculture\n\n2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:45.400\n and that was not accepted in any way.\n\n2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:47.120\n And not the heroes that you see today\n\n2:40:47.120 --> 2:40:52.000\n that are on the richest people in the world and everything.\n\n2:40:52.000 --> 2:40:54.280\n So that was the first set of trauma.\n\n2:40:54.280 --> 2:40:56.640\n And then the next one really was general magic.\n\n2:40:56.640 --> 2:40:59.080\n You know, the end of that, like I described before.\n\n2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:01.840\n And pulling yourself out and going just,\n\n2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:03.960\n cause I got so insular in that world\n\n2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:07.080\n of geeking out and building stuff\n\n2:41:07.080 --> 2:41:09.720\n that I just tore all the social ties, right?\n\n2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:12.960\n Because it was just, it was a drug.\n\n2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:13.920\n I was hooked on that.\n\n2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:15.440\n I was a junkie.\n\n2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:17.920\n I had to get clean.\n\n2:41:17.920 --> 2:41:22.920\n Yeah, and that made you who you are.\n\n2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:24.760\n Tempered, tempered.\n\n2:41:28.040 --> 2:41:31.280\n So Steve Jobs is no longer with us.\n\n2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:36.280\n One day you also will no longer be with us.\n\n2:41:36.280 --> 2:41:39.720\n That's the thing about this life, it ends.\n\n2:41:41.880 --> 2:41:43.840\n So no matter how many incredible things\n\n2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:44.920\n you brought to this world,\n\n2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:48.120\n no matter how many inventions you built,\n\n2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:49.520\n you too shall perish.\n\n2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:51.520\n Do you think about this?\n\n2:41:51.520 --> 2:41:53.600\n Are you afraid of your death?\n\n2:41:57.680 --> 2:41:59.120\n I am not afraid of my death.\n\n2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:02.400\n I am an atheist.\n\n2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:06.760\n And I think about the soul.\n\n2:42:06.760 --> 2:42:08.400\n Because I do, even though I'm an atheist,\n\n2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:09.320\n I think about the soul.\n\n2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:14.120\n And the soul is the thing that you instill in others\n\n2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:16.000\n when you go that lives on.\n\n2:42:16.880 --> 2:42:20.520\n It's not this thing that's magically in space.\n\n2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:23.360\n It's the thing that you've imparted onto people\n\n2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:26.520\n that you worked with and those relationships you've had.\n\n2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:31.320\n And that soul lives on in the stories that they tell, right?\n\n2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:34.040\n And through Build, I'm hopeful that those stories\n\n2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:36.600\n stay relevant because they're human nature.\n\n2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:39.280\n They're not about who knows what the next iPhone thing is\n\n2:42:39.280 --> 2:42:40.680\n or the next iPod thing is.\n\n2:42:40.680 --> 2:42:45.120\n The stuff that I have been able, the privilege to make\n\n2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:48.480\n and work with people, those are all ephemeral.\n\n2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:49.760\n The iPod's gone now, right?\n\n2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:54.280\n This week, it was announced iPod's dead after 21 years.\n\n2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:59.120\n It is those human connections.\n\n2:42:59.120 --> 2:43:00.840\n It's that growth that you've helped someone\n\n2:43:00.840 --> 2:43:02.440\n just like they helped me.\n\n2:43:02.440 --> 2:43:04.920\n Just like Bill Campbell or Steve Jobs is gone,\n\n2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:06.920\n but they made me be better.\n\n2:43:06.920 --> 2:43:09.080\n That's the soul that I believe in.\n\n2:43:09.080 --> 2:43:11.320\n That's fascinating that you say that.\n\n2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:14.240\n Yeah, so many of these products,\n\n2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:16.080\n I mean, to push back a little bit,\n\n2:43:16.080 --> 2:43:18.480\n so even though the iPod is an end of an era.\n\n2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:20.960\n Using it every day.\n\n2:43:22.040 --> 2:43:25.720\n I think that, I mean, the number of people that impacted\n\n2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:31.640\n is just, so I suppose the soul is carried by the people.\n\n2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:33.000\n Exactly.\n\n2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:34.720\n Sometimes the products you create\n\n2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:36.520\n is the sort of the transport mechanism.\n\n2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:38.120\n It's the vessel.\n\n2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:38.960\n It's the vessel.\n\n2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:41.400\n They felt the love, and they felt that love,\n\n2:43:41.400 --> 2:43:42.400\n and it transformed them,\n\n2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:44.480\n even if they don't have the vessel anymore.\n\n2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:46.720\n Yeah, and in that way, the soul lives on.\n\n2:43:46.720 --> 2:43:48.800\n Just like the body is the vessel.\n\n2:43:48.800 --> 2:43:50.240\n That's beautifully put.\n\n2:43:50.240 --> 2:43:52.160\n Why do you think we're here?\n\n2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:54.360\n What's the meaning of life, Tony?\n\n2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:56.560\n Jesus Christ.\n\n2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:58.000\n And death, man.\n\n2:43:58.000 --> 2:43:58.960\n We're going all around.\n\n2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:00.000\n Meaning of life?\n\n2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:01.040\n Why, why?\n\n2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:03.680\n Because you said it's important to have a press release.\n\n2:44:03.680 --> 2:44:04.520\n I did.\n\n2:44:07.280 --> 2:44:08.120\n Okay.\n\n2:44:08.120 --> 2:44:09.240\n If humanity, if life on earth,\n\n2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:11.800\n if this thing, the consciousness,\n\n2:44:11.800 --> 2:44:15.600\n the falling in love, and building bridges,\n\n2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:18.480\n and iPods, and rockets,\n\n2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:22.040\n and trying to extend out into the cosmos, why?\n\n2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:23.640\n Why do you think we're doing it?\n\n2:44:25.800 --> 2:44:27.680\n Is there any meaning to it?\n\n2:44:27.680 --> 2:44:30.000\n We are naturally curious.\n\n2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:35.000\n We're, we are naturally curious individuals.\n\n2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:39.040\n And we are always looking for meaning.\n\n2:44:39.920 --> 2:44:42.760\n We're always trying to ascribe meaning to something,\n\n2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:46.320\n or understanding of something, right?\n\n2:44:46.320 --> 2:44:49.680\n And through that, it's just like evolution, right?\n\n2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:50.600\n And Darwinism.\n\n2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:53.600\n It's just that thing that's baked into our being\n\n2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:55.280\n at the most fundamental level.\n\n2:44:55.280 --> 2:44:56.720\n Driven by curiosity.\n\n2:44:56.720 --> 2:44:58.720\n Driven by curiosity.\n\n2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:01.360\n You're creating some pretty cool things along the way.\n\n2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:03.480\n Tony, you, and speaking of cool things,\n\n2:45:03.480 --> 2:45:06.880\n you've created some of the coolest things ever.\n\n2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:09.440\n And on top of that, you're just an amazing human being.\n\n2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:11.640\n It's a huge honor that you'll sit and talk to me today.\n\n2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:12.800\n This is fun.\n\n2:45:12.800 --> 2:45:14.320\n Lex, this is great.\n\n2:45:14.320 --> 2:45:16.160\n I didn't know where I was going,\n\n2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:18.880\n and I'm, let's talk, I'm looking for season.\n\n2:45:18.880 --> 2:45:19.720\n I would love to.\n\n2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:20.560\n Seven, eight, nine.\n\n2:45:20.560 --> 2:45:21.400\n Six, seven, yes.\n\n2:45:21.400 --> 2:45:22.840\n Let's go hang out and have dinner,\n\n2:45:22.840 --> 2:45:24.920\n and just rap about all kinds of crazy,\n\n2:45:24.920 --> 2:45:26.480\n I'd love to continue this.\n\n2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:27.320\n I would too.\n\n2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:28.160\n Thank you so much, Tony.\n\n2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:29.560\n Thanks, man.\n\n2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:32.360\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tony Fadal.\n\n2:45:32.360 --> 2:45:33.880\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:36.960\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:39.000\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.200\n from Tony Fadal himself.\n\n2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:43.720\n The most wonderful part of building something together\n\n2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:46.720\n with a team is that you're walking side by side\n\n2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:48.320\n with other people.\n\n2:45:48.320 --> 2:45:49.880\n You're all looking at your feet\n\n2:45:49.880 --> 2:45:52.520\n and scanning the horizon at the same time.\n\n2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:54.640\n Some people will see things you can't,\n\n2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:58.480\n and you will see things that are invisible to everyone else.\n\n2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:00.920\n So don't think doing the work just means\n\n2:46:00.920 --> 2:46:02.800\n locking yourself into a room.\n\n2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:05.320\n A huge part of it is walking with your team.\n\n2:46:06.200 --> 2:46:09.240\n The work is reaching your destination together\n\n2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:11.320\n or finding a new destination\n\n2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:13.240\n and bringing the team with you.\n\n2:46:13.240 --> 2:46:33.240\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
