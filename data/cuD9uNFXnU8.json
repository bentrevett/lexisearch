--> 00:12.620\n Sam Harris recommended that I absolutely must talk to Rob about his recent work on the\n\n00:12.620 --> 00:15.120\n future of engineer pandemics.\n\n00:15.120 --> 00:21.580\n I then listened to the 4 hours special episode of Sam's Making Sense podcast with Rob titled\n\n00:21.580 --> 00:27.260\n Engineering the Apocalypse, and I was floored, and knew I had to talk to him.\n\n00:27.260 --> 00:33.560\n Quick mention of our sponsors, Athletic Greens, Belcampo, Fundrise, and NetSuite.\n\n00:33.560 --> 00:36.960\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:36.960 --> 00:41.880\n As a side note, let me say a few words about the lab leak hypothesis, which proposes that\n\n00:41.880 --> 00:47.560\n COVID 19 is a product of gain of function research on coronaviruses conducted at the\n\n00:47.560 --> 00:53.120\n Wuhan Institute of Virology that was then accidentally leaked due to human error.\n\n00:53.120 --> 00:59.080\n For context, this lab is biosafety level 4, BSL 4, and it investigates coronaviruses.\n\n00:59.080 --> 01:04.040\n BSL 4 is the highest level of safety, but if you look at all the human in the loop pieces\n\n01:04.040 --> 01:09.060\n required to achieve this level of safety, it becomes clear that even BSL 4 labs are\n\n01:09.060 --> 01:11.560\n highly susceptible to human error.\n\n01:11.560 --> 01:15.800\n To me, whether the virus leaked from the lab or not, getting to the bottom of what happened\n\n01:15.800 --> 01:18.800\n is about much more than this particular catastrophic case.\n\n01:18.800 --> 01:25.000\n It is a test for our scientific, political, journalistic, and social institutions of how\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:31.440\n well we can prepare and respond to threats that can cripple or destroy human civilization.\n\n01:31.440 --> 01:37.000\n If we continue gain of function research on viruses, eventually these viruses will leak,\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:40.220\n and they will be more deadly and more contagious.\n\n01:40.220 --> 01:45.880\n We can pretend that won't happen, or we can openly and honestly talk about the risks involved.\n\n01:45.880 --> 01:49.880\n This research can both save and destroy human life on earth as we know it.\n\n01:49.880 --> 01:52.640\n It's a powerful double edged sword.\n\n01:52.640 --> 01:59.000\n If YouTube and other platforms censor conversations about this, if scientists self censor conversations\n\n01:59.000 --> 02:05.940\n about this, we'll become merely victims of our brief homo sapiens story, not its heroes.\n\n02:05.940 --> 02:11.540\n As I said before, too carelessly labeling ideas as misinformation and dismissing them\n\n02:11.540 --> 02:16.840\n because of that will eventually destroy our ability to discover the truth, and without\n\n02:16.840 --> 02:22.880\n truth we don't have a fighting chance against the great filter before us.\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:28.960\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Rob Reid.\n\n02:28.960 --> 02:33.920\n I have seen evidence on the internet that you have a sense of humor, allegedly, but\n\n02:33.920 --> 02:38.280\n you also talk and think about the destruction of human civilization.\n\n02:38.280 --> 02:42.880\n What do you think of the Elon Musk hypothesis that the most entertaining outcome is the\n\n02:42.880 --> 02:44.560\n most likely?\n\n02:44.560 --> 02:49.280\n And he, I think, followed on to say a scene from an external observer, like if somebody\n\n02:49.280 --> 02:56.600\n was watching us, it seems we come up with creative ways of progressing our civilization\n\n02:56.600 --> 02:57.600\n that's fun to watch.\n\n02:57.600 --> 03:03.380\n Yeah, so he, exactly, he said from the standpoint of the observer, not the participant, I think.\n\n03:03.380 --> 03:07.600\n And so what's interesting about that, those were, I think, just a couple of freestanding\n\n03:07.600 --> 03:12.520\n tweets and delivered without a whole lot of wrapper of context, so it's left to the mind\n\n03:12.520 --> 03:16.920\n of the reader of the tweets to infer what he was talking about.\n\n03:16.920 --> 03:20.400\n So that's kind of like, it provokes some interesting thoughts.\n\n03:20.400 --> 03:26.480\n Like first of all, it presupposes the existence of an observer, and it also presupposes that\n\n03:26.480 --> 03:32.040\n the observer wishes to be entertained and has some mechanism of enforcing their desire\n\n03:32.040 --> 03:33.080\n to be entertained.\n\n03:33.080 --> 03:35.540\n So there's like a lot underpinning that.\n\n03:35.540 --> 03:40.280\n And to me, that suggests, particularly coming from Elon, that it's a reference to simulation\n\n03:40.280 --> 03:46.400\n theory, that somebody is out there and has far greater insights and a far greater ability\n\n03:46.400 --> 03:52.000\n to, let's say, peer into a single individual life and find that entertaining and full of\n\n03:52.000 --> 03:58.440\n plot twists and surprises and either a happy or tragic ending, or they have an incredible\n\n03:58.440 --> 04:04.320\n meta view and they can watch the arc of civilization unfolding in a way that is entertaining and\n\n04:04.320 --> 04:08.160\n full of plot twists and surprises and a happy or unhappy ending.\n\n04:08.160 --> 04:11.960\n So okay, so we're presupposing an observer.\n\n04:11.960 --> 04:17.520\n Then on top of that, when you think about it, you're also presupposing a producer,\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:23.440\n because the act of observation is mostly fun if there are plot twists and surprises and\n\n04:23.440 --> 04:25.840\n other developments that you weren't foreseeing.\n\n04:25.840 --> 04:30.760\n I have reread my own novels, and that's fun because it's something that I worked hard\n\n04:30.760 --> 04:34.960\n on and I slaved over and I love, but there aren't a lot of surprises in there.\n\n04:34.960 --> 04:39.960\n So now I'm thinking we need a producer and an observer for that to be true.\n\n04:39.960 --> 04:45.260\n And on top of that, it's got to be a very competent producer because Elon said the most\n\n04:45.260 --> 04:48.440\n entertaining outcome is the most likely one.\n\n04:48.440 --> 04:51.600\n So there's lots of layers for thinking about that.\n\n04:51.600 --> 04:55.280\n And when you've got a producer who's trying to make it entertaining, it makes me think\n\n04:55.280 --> 05:00.760\n of there was a South Park episode in which Earth turned out to be a reality show.\n\n05:00.760 --> 05:05.920\n And somehow we had failed to entertain the audience as much as we used to, so the Earth\n\n05:05.920 --> 05:09.120\n show was going to get canceled, et cetera.\n\n05:09.120 --> 05:13.200\n So taking all that together, and I'm obviously being a little bit playful in laying this\n\n05:13.200 --> 05:20.220\n out, what is the evidence that we have that we are in a reality that is intended to be\n\n05:20.220 --> 05:21.720\n most entertaining?\n\n05:21.720 --> 05:26.300\n Now you could look at that reality on the level of individual lives or the whole arc\n\n05:26.300 --> 05:30.040\n of civilization, other lives, levels as well, I'm sure.\n\n05:30.040 --> 05:34.240\n But just looking from my own life, I think I'd make a pretty lousy show.\n\n05:34.240 --> 05:38.880\n I spend an inordinate amount of time just looking at a computer.\n\n05:38.880 --> 05:40.640\n I don't think that's very entertaining.\n\n05:40.640 --> 05:46.360\n And there's just a completely inadequate level of shootouts and car chases in my life.\n\n05:46.360 --> 05:50.120\n I mean, I'll go weeks, even months without a single shootout or car chase.\n\n05:50.120 --> 05:53.000\n That just means that you're one of the non player characters in this game.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:54.000\n You're just waiting.\n\n05:54.000 --> 05:55.200\n I'm an extra.\n\n05:55.200 --> 05:59.120\n You're an extra that waiting for your one opportunity for a brief moment to actually\n\n05:59.120 --> 06:03.120\n interact with one of the main characters in the play.\n\n06:03.120 --> 06:04.600\n Okay, that's good.\n\n06:04.600 --> 06:08.520\n So okay, so we rule out me being the star of the show, which I probably could have guessed\n\n06:08.520 --> 06:09.520\n at.\n\n06:09.520 --> 06:13.260\n Anyway, but then even the arc of civilization, I mean, there have been a lot of really intriguing\n\n06:13.260 --> 06:16.560\n things that have happened and a lot of astounding things that have happened.\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:23.280\n But I would have some werewolves, I'd have some zombies, I would have some really improbable\n\n06:23.280 --> 06:28.660\n developments like maybe Canada absorbing the United States.\n\n06:28.660 --> 06:33.240\n So I don't know, I'm not sure if we're necessarily designed for maximum entertainment.\n\n06:33.240 --> 06:40.280\n But if we are, that will mean that 2020 is just a prequel for even more bizarre years\n\n06:40.280 --> 06:41.320\n ahead.\n\n06:41.320 --> 06:45.120\n So I kind of hope that we're not designed for maximum entertainment.\n\n06:45.120 --> 06:47.840\n Well, the night is still young in terms of Canada.\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:52.520\n But do you think it's possible for the observer and the producer to be kind of emergent?\n\n06:52.520 --> 06:59.380\n So meaning, it does seem when you kind of watch memes on the internet, the funny ones,\n\n06:59.380 --> 07:01.640\n the entertaining ones spread more efficiently.\n\n07:01.640 --> 07:02.640\n They do.\n\n07:02.640 --> 07:11.560\n I mean, I don't know what it is about the human mind that soaks up on mass funny things\n\n07:11.560 --> 07:12.920\n much more sort of aggressively.\n\n07:12.920 --> 07:16.760\n It's more viral in the full sense of that word.\n\n07:16.760 --> 07:23.560\n Is there some sense that whatever the evolutionary process that created our cognitive capabilities\n\n07:23.560 --> 07:28.440\n is the same process that's going to, in an emergent way, create the most entertaining\n\n07:28.440 --> 07:36.120\n outcome, the most memeifiable outcome, the most viral outcome if we were to share it\n\n07:36.120 --> 07:37.120\n on Twitter?\n\n07:37.120 --> 07:38.680\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n07:38.680 --> 07:41.680\n Yeah, we do have an incredible ability.\n\n07:41.680 --> 07:45.040\n Like I mean, how many memes are created in a given day and the ones that go viral are\n\n07:45.040 --> 07:48.800\n almost uniformly funny, at least to somebody with a particular sense of humor.\n\n07:48.800 --> 07:53.560\n Yeah, I'd have to think about that.\n\n07:53.560 --> 07:59.120\n We are definitely great at creating atomized units of funny.\n\n07:59.120 --> 08:05.040\n Like in the example that you used, there are going to be X million brains parsing and judging\n\n08:05.040 --> 08:07.520\n whether this meme is retweetable or not.\n\n08:07.520 --> 08:14.860\n And so that sort of atomic element of funniness, of entertainingness, et cetera, we definitely\n\n08:14.860 --> 08:20.160\n have an environment that's good at selecting for that and selective pressure and everything\n\n08:20.160 --> 08:21.920\n else that's going on.\n\n08:21.920 --> 08:31.180\n But in terms of the entire ecosystem of conscious systems here on the Earth driving for a level\n\n08:31.180 --> 08:38.720\n of entertainment, that is on such a much higher level that I don't know if that would necessarily\n\n08:38.720 --> 08:44.860\n follow directly from the fact that atomic units of entertainment are very, very aptly\n\n08:44.860 --> 08:45.960\n selected for us.\n\n08:45.960 --> 08:46.960\n I don't know.\n\n08:46.960 --> 08:54.400\n Do you find it compelling or useful to think about human civilization from the perspective\n\n08:54.400 --> 08:59.760\n of the ideas versus the perspective of the individual human brains?\n\n08:59.760 --> 09:02.560\n Just almost thinking about the ideas or the memes.\n\n09:02.560 --> 09:09.520\n This is the Dawkins thing as the organisms and then the humans as just like vehicles\n\n09:09.520 --> 09:13.960\n for briefly carrying those organisms as they jump around and spread.\n\n09:13.960 --> 09:19.360\n Yeah, for propagating them, mutating them, putting selective pressure on them, et cetera.\n\n09:19.360 --> 09:27.400\n I mean, I found Dawkins interpret or his launching of the idea of memes is just kind of an afterthought\n\n09:27.400 --> 09:32.120\n to his unbelievably brilliant book about the selfish gene.\n\n09:32.120 --> 09:37.440\n What a PS to put at the end of a long chunk of writing, profoundly interesting.\n\n09:37.440 --> 09:43.640\n I view the relationship though between humans and memes as probably an oversimplification,\n\n09:43.640 --> 09:47.740\n but maybe a little bit like the relationship between flowers and bees, right?\n\n09:47.740 --> 09:52.000\n Do flowers have bees or do bees in a sense have flowers?\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:58.640\n And the answer is it is a very, very symbiotic relationship in which both have semi independent\n\n09:58.640 --> 10:03.320\n roles that they play and both are highly dependent upon the other.\n\n10:03.320 --> 10:07.780\n And so in the case of bees, obviously, you could see the flower is being this monolithic\n\n10:07.780 --> 10:14.320\n structure physically in relation to any given bee and it's the source of food and sustenance.\n\n10:14.320 --> 10:17.140\n So you could kind of say, well, flowers have bees.\n\n10:17.140 --> 10:20.800\n But on the other hand, the flowers would obviously be doomed.\n\n10:20.800 --> 10:22.920\n They weren't being pollinated by the bees.\n\n10:22.920 --> 10:26.480\n So you could kind of say, well, you know, bees are, you know, flowers are really expression\n\n10:26.480 --> 10:28.600\n of what the bees need.\n\n10:28.600 --> 10:30.600\n And the truth is a symbiosis.\n\n10:30.600 --> 10:39.160\n So with, with memes and human minds, our brains are clearly the Petri dishes in which memes\n\n10:39.160 --> 10:45.420\n are either propagated or not propagated, get mutated or don't get mutated if they are the\n\n10:45.420 --> 10:51.420\n venue in which competition, selective competition plays out between different memes.\n\n10:51.420 --> 10:53.080\n So all of that is very true.\n\n10:53.080 --> 10:58.880\n And you could look at that and say, really, the human mind is a production of memes and\n\n10:58.880 --> 11:01.880\n ideas have us rather than us having ideas.\n\n11:01.880 --> 11:07.160\n But at the same time, let's take a catchy tune as an example of a meme.\n\n11:07.160 --> 11:11.320\n That catchy tune did originate in a human mind.\n\n11:11.320 --> 11:13.000\n Somebody had to structure that thing.\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:18.720\n And as much as I like Elizabeth Gilbert's TED talk about how the universe, I'm simplifying,\n\n11:18.720 --> 11:22.960\n but you know, kind of the ideas find their way in this beautiful TED talk.\n\n11:22.960 --> 11:23.960\n It's very lyrical.\n\n11:23.960 --> 11:30.160\n She talked about, you know, ideas and prose kind of beaming into our minds.\n\n11:30.160 --> 11:33.240\n And you know, she talked about needing to pull over to the side of the road when she\n\n11:33.240 --> 11:38.260\n got inspiration for a particular paragraph or a particular idea and a burning need to\n\n11:38.260 --> 11:40.160\n write that down.\n\n11:40.160 --> 11:41.160\n I love that.\n\n11:41.160 --> 11:47.520\n It's that beautiful as a writer, as a novelist myself, I've never had that experience.\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:54.160\n And I think that really most things that do become memes are the product of a great deal\n\n11:54.160 --> 11:59.520\n of deliberate and willful exertion of a conscious mind.\n\n11:59.520 --> 12:04.440\n And so like the bees and the flowers, I think there's a great symbiosis and they both kind\n\n12:04.440 --> 12:05.740\n of have one another.\n\n12:05.740 --> 12:08.000\n Ideas have us, but we have ideas for real.\n\n12:08.000 --> 12:14.400\n If we could take a little bit of a tangent, Stephen King on writing, you as a great writer,\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:18.360\n you're dropping a hint here that the ideas don't come to you.\n\n12:18.360 --> 12:22.760\n It's a grind of sort of, it's almost like you're mining for gold.\n\n12:22.760 --> 12:28.160\n It's more of a very deliberate, rigorous daily process.\n\n12:28.160 --> 12:32.640\n So maybe can you talk about the writing process?\n\n12:32.640 --> 12:36.560\n How do you write well?\n\n12:36.560 --> 12:42.560\n And maybe if you want to step outside of yourself, almost like give advice to an aspiring writer,\n\n12:42.560 --> 12:46.400\n what does it take to write the best work of your life?\n\n12:46.400 --> 12:50.000\n Well it would be very different if it's fiction versus nonfiction.\n\n12:50.000 --> 12:51.000\n And I've done both.\n\n12:51.000 --> 12:55.600\n I've written two nonfiction books and two works of fiction.\n\n12:55.600 --> 12:58.800\n Two works of fiction being more recent, I'm going to focus on that right now because that's\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:02.120\n more toweringly on my mind.\n\n13:02.120 --> 13:08.640\n Bronx novelists, again, this is an oversimplification, but there's kind of two schools of thought.\n\n13:08.640 --> 13:12.640\n Some people really like to fly by the seat of their pants and some people really, really\n\n13:12.640 --> 13:15.680\n like to outline, to plot.\n\n13:15.680 --> 13:20.180\n So there's plotters and pantsers, I guess is one way that people look at it.\n\n13:20.180 --> 13:24.800\n And as with most things, there is a great continuum in between and I'm somewhere on\n\n13:24.800 --> 13:29.920\n that continuum, but I lean, I guess, a little bit more toward the plotter.\n\n13:29.920 --> 13:35.080\n And so when I do start a novel, I have a pretty strong point of view about how it's going\n\n13:35.080 --> 13:39.360\n to end and I have a very strong point of view about how it's going to begin.\n\n13:39.360 --> 13:44.240\n And I do try to make an effort of making an outline that I know I'm going to be extremely\n\n13:44.240 --> 13:49.600\n unfaithful to in the actual execution of the story, but trying to make an outline that\n\n13:49.600 --> 13:54.460\n gets us from here to there and notion of subplots and beats and rhythm and different characters\n\n13:54.460 --> 13:56.280\n and so forth.\n\n13:56.280 --> 14:02.000\n But then when I get into the process, that outline, particularly the center of it, ultimately\n\n14:02.000 --> 14:03.760\n inevitably morphs a great deal.\n\n14:03.760 --> 14:08.920\n And I think if I were personally a rigorous outliner, I would not allow that to happen.\n\n14:08.920 --> 14:14.380\n I also would make a much more vigorous skeleton before I start.\n\n14:14.380 --> 14:22.400\n So I think people who are really in that plotting outlining mode are people who write page turners,\n\n14:22.400 --> 14:30.560\n people who write spy novels or supernatural adventures, where you really want a relentless\n\n14:30.560 --> 14:37.560\n pace of events, action, plot twists, conspiracy, et cetera.\n\n14:37.560 --> 14:40.560\n And that is really the bone.\n\n14:40.560 --> 14:42.880\n That's really the skeletal structure.\n\n14:42.880 --> 14:47.520\n So I think folks who write that kind of book are really very much on the outlining side.\n\n14:47.520 --> 14:52.160\n And then I think people who write what's often referred to as literary fiction for lack of\n\n14:52.160 --> 14:59.640\n a better term, where it's more about sort of aura and ambiance and character development\n\n14:59.640 --> 15:05.520\n and experience and inner experience and inner journey and so forth, I think that group is\n\n15:05.520 --> 15:07.640\n more likely to fly by the seat of their pants.\n\n15:07.640 --> 15:11.000\n And I know people who start with a blank page and just see where it's going to go.\n\n15:11.000 --> 15:14.480\n I'm a little bit more on the plotting side.\n\n15:14.480 --> 15:21.200\n Now you asked what makes something, at least in the mind of the writer, as great as it\n\n15:21.200 --> 15:22.200\n can be.\n\n15:22.200 --> 15:26.960\n For me, it's an astonishingly high percentage of it is editing as opposed to the initial\n\n15:26.960 --> 15:27.960\n writing.\n\n15:27.960 --> 15:36.560\n For every hour that I spend writing new prose, like new pages, new paragraphs, new bits of\n\n15:36.560 --> 15:40.280\n the book, I probably spend...\n\n15:40.280 --> 15:42.680\n I wish I kept a count.\n\n15:42.680 --> 15:47.240\n I wish I had one of those pieces of software that lawyers use to decide how much time I'm\n\n15:47.240 --> 15:48.240\n going to be doing this, that.\n\n15:48.240 --> 15:53.200\n But I would say it's at least four or five hours and maybe as many as 10 that I spend\n\n15:53.200 --> 15:54.340\n editing.\n\n15:54.340 --> 15:56.560\n And so it's relentless for me.\n\n15:56.560 --> 15:58.400\n For each one hour of writing, you said?\n\n15:58.400 --> 15:59.400\n I'd say that.\n\n15:59.400 --> 16:00.400\n Four, wow.\n\n16:00.400 --> 16:07.200\n I mean, I write because I edit and I spend just relentlessly polishing and pruning and\n\n16:07.200 --> 16:12.400\n sometimes on the micro level of just like, does the rhythm of the sentence feel right?\n\n16:12.400 --> 16:15.680\n Do I need to carve a syllable or something so it can land?\n\n16:15.680 --> 16:21.760\n Like as micro as that to as macro as like, okay, I'm done but the book is 750 pages long\n\n16:21.760 --> 16:25.160\n and it's way too bloated and I need to lop a third out of it.\n\n16:25.160 --> 16:30.680\n Problems on those two orders of magnitude and everything in between, that is an enormous\n\n16:30.680 --> 16:31.840\n amount of my time.\n\n16:31.840 --> 16:37.320\n And I also write music, write and record and produce music.\n\n16:37.320 --> 16:40.320\n And there the ratio is even higher.\n\n16:40.320 --> 16:47.720\n Every minute that I spend or my band spends laying down that original audio, it's a very\n\n16:47.720 --> 16:52.640\n high proportion of hours that go into just making it all hang together and sound just\n\n16:52.640 --> 16:53.640\n right.\n\n16:53.640 --> 16:56.200\n So I think that's true of a lot of creative processes.\n\n16:56.200 --> 16:58.200\n I know it's true of sculpture.\n\n16:58.200 --> 16:59.920\n I believe it's true of woodwork.\n\n16:59.920 --> 17:04.400\n My dad was an amateur woodworker and he spent a huge amount of time on sanding and polishing\n\n17:04.400 --> 17:05.480\n at the end.\n\n17:05.480 --> 17:09.200\n So I think a great deal of the sparkle comes from that part of the process, any creative\n\n17:09.200 --> 17:10.200\n process.\n\n17:10.200 --> 17:14.480\n Can I ask about the psychological, the demon side of that picture?\n\n17:14.480 --> 17:18.360\n In the editing process, you're ultimately judging the initial piece of work and you're\n\n17:18.360 --> 17:20.840\n judging and judging and judging.\n\n17:20.840 --> 17:26.000\n How much of your time do you spend hating your work?\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:33.880\n How much time do you spend in gratitude, impressed, thankful, or how good the work that you will\n\n17:33.880 --> 17:36.000\n put together is?\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:42.360\n I spend almost all the time in a place that's intermediate between those, but leaning toward\n\n17:42.360 --> 17:43.360\n gratitude.\n\n17:43.360 --> 17:49.680\n I spend almost all the time in a state of optimism that this thing that I have, I like,\n\n17:49.680 --> 17:56.160\n I like quite a bit and I can make it better and better and better with every time I go\n\n17:56.160 --> 17:57.160\n through it.\n\n17:57.160 --> 18:01.680\n So I spend most of my time in a state of optimism.\n\n18:01.680 --> 18:06.620\n I think I personally oscillate much more aggressively between those two, where I wouldn't be able\n\n18:06.620 --> 18:07.880\n to find the average.\n\n18:07.880 --> 18:11.520\n I go pretty deep.\n\n18:11.520 --> 18:19.920\n Marvin Minsky from MIT had this advice, I guess, to what it takes to be successful in\n\n18:19.920 --> 18:23.280\n science and research is to hate everything you do.\n\n18:23.280 --> 18:25.520\n You've ever done in the past.\n\n18:25.520 --> 18:31.520\n I mean, at least he was speaking about himself that the key to his success was to hate everything\n\n18:31.520 --> 18:32.520\n he's ever done.\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:39.000\n I have a little Marvin Minsky there in me too, to sort of always be exceptionally self\n\n18:39.000 --> 18:45.800\n critical, but almost like self critical about the work, but grateful for the chance to be\n\n18:45.800 --> 18:46.800\n able to do the work.\n\n18:46.800 --> 18:47.800\n If that makes sense.\n\n18:47.800 --> 18:48.800\n It makes perfect sense.\n\n18:48.800 --> 18:56.120\n But that, you know, each one of us have to strike a certain kind of balance.\n\n18:56.120 --> 19:00.400\n But back to the destruction of human civilization.\n\n19:00.400 --> 19:08.800\n If humans destroy ourselves in the next hundred years, what will be the most likely source,\n\n19:08.800 --> 19:10.800\n the most likely reason that we destroy ourselves?\n\n19:10.800 --> 19:14.080\n Well, let's see, a hundred years.\n\n19:14.080 --> 19:19.480\n It's hard for me to comfortably predict out that far, and it's something to give a lot\n\n19:19.480 --> 19:25.880\n more thought to, I think, than normal folks simply because I am a science fiction writer.\n\n19:25.880 --> 19:31.760\n And you know, I feel with the acceleration of technological progress, it's really hard\n\n19:31.760 --> 19:33.800\n to foresee out more than just a few decades.\n\n19:33.800 --> 19:39.600\n I mean, comparing today's world to that of 1921, where we are right now, a century later,\n\n19:39.600 --> 19:42.000\n it would have been so unforeseeable.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:46.160\n And I just don't know what's going to happen, particularly with exponential technologies.\n\n19:46.160 --> 19:51.840\n I mean, our intuitions reliably defeat ourselves with exponential technologies like computing\n\n19:51.840 --> 19:57.120\n and synthetic biology and, you know, how we might destroy ourselves in the hundred year\n\n19:57.120 --> 20:02.720\n time frame might have everything to do with breakthroughs in nanotechnology 40 years from\n\n20:02.720 --> 20:05.600\n now and then how rapidly those breakthroughs accelerate.\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:10.520\n But in the near term that I'm comfortable predicting, let's say 30 years, I would say\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:16.600\n the most likely route to self destruction would be synthetic biology.\n\n20:16.600 --> 20:22.320\n And I always say that with the gigantic caveat and very important one that I find, and I'll\n\n20:22.320 --> 20:25.880\n abbreviate synthetic biology to SynBio just to save us some syllables.\n\n20:25.880 --> 20:34.320\n I believe SynBio offers us simply stunning promise that we would be fools to deny ourselves.\n\n20:34.320 --> 20:37.160\n So I'm not an anti SynBio person by any stretch.\n\n20:37.160 --> 20:43.520\n I mean, SynBio has unbelievable odds of helping us beat cancer, helping us rescue the environment,\n\n20:43.520 --> 20:46.280\n helping us do things that we would currently find imponderable.\n\n20:46.280 --> 20:48.520\n So it's electrifying the field.\n\n20:48.520 --> 20:54.920\n But in the wrong hands, those hands either being incompetent or being malevolent.\n\n20:54.920 --> 21:03.000\n In the wrong hands, synthetic biology to me has a much, much greater odds of leading to\n\n21:03.000 --> 21:08.100\n our self destruction than something running amok with super AI, which I believe is a real\n\n21:08.100 --> 21:10.400\n possibility and one we need to be concerned about.\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:14.960\n But in the 30 year time frame, I think it's a lesser one or nuclear weapons or anything\n\n21:14.960 --> 21:16.840\n else that I can think of.\n\n21:16.840 --> 21:18.520\n Can you explain that a little bit further?\n\n21:18.520 --> 21:26.220\n So your concern is on the manmade versus the natural side of the pandemic frontier.\n\n21:26.220 --> 21:34.120\n So we humans, engineering pathogens, engineering viruses is the concern here.\n\n21:34.120 --> 21:41.400\n And maybe how do you see the possible trajectories happening here in terms of, is it malevolent\n\n21:41.400 --> 21:51.440\n or is it accidents, oops, little mistakes or unintended consequences of particular actions\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:53.760\n that are ultimately lead to unexpected mistakes?\n\n21:53.760 --> 21:55.800\n Well, both of them are a danger.\n\n21:55.800 --> 22:00.920\n And I think the question of which is more likely has to do with two things.\n\n22:00.920 --> 22:08.720\n One, do we take a lot of methodical, affordable, foresighted steps that we are absolutely capable\n\n22:08.720 --> 22:14.560\n of taking right now to forestall the risk of a bad actor infecting us with something\n\n22:14.560 --> 22:17.200\n that could have annihilating impacts?\n\n22:17.200 --> 22:22.540\n And in the episode you referenced with Sam, we talked a great deal about that.\n\n22:22.540 --> 22:24.160\n So do we take those steps?\n\n22:24.160 --> 22:29.380\n And if we take those steps, I think the danger of malevolent rogue actors doing us in with\n\n22:29.380 --> 22:31.840\n Sin Bio couldn't plummet.\n\n22:31.840 --> 22:36.200\n But you know, it's always a question of if and we have a bad, bad and very long track\n\n22:36.200 --> 22:41.460\n record of hitting the snooze bar after different natural pandemics have attacked us.\n\n22:41.460 --> 22:43.800\n So that's variable number one.\n\n22:43.800 --> 22:51.980\n Variable number two is how much experimentation and pathogen development do we as a society\n\n22:51.980 --> 22:59.160\n decide is acceptable in the realms of academia, government or private industry?\n\n22:59.160 --> 23:06.160\n And if we decide as a society that it's perfectly okay for people with varying research agendas\n\n23:06.160 --> 23:12.400\n to create pathogens that if released could wipe out humanity, if we think that's fine\n\n23:12.400 --> 23:19.140\n and if that kind of work starts happening in one lab, five labs, 50 labs, 500 labs in\n\n23:19.140 --> 23:26.360\n one country, then 10 countries, then 70 countries or whatever, that risk of a boo boo starts\n\n23:26.360 --> 23:28.680\n rising astronomically.\n\n23:28.680 --> 23:33.400\n And this won't be a spoiler alert based on the way that I presented those two things,\n\n23:33.400 --> 23:37.580\n but I think it's unbelievably important to manage both of those risks.\n\n23:37.580 --> 23:42.240\n The easier one to manage, although it wouldn't be simple by any stretch because it would\n\n23:42.240 --> 23:45.160\n have to be something that all nations agree on.\n\n23:45.160 --> 23:52.380\n But the easiest way, the easier risk to manage is that of, hey guys, let's not develop pathogens\n\n23:52.380 --> 23:56.280\n that if they escaped from a lab could annihilate us.\n\n23:56.280 --> 23:58.720\n There's no line of research that justifies that.\n\n23:58.720 --> 24:02.000\n And in my view, I mean, that's the point of perspective we need to have.\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:06.160\n We'd have to collectively agree that there's no line of research that justifies that.\n\n24:06.160 --> 24:11.240\n The reason why I believe that would be a highly rational conclusion is even the highest level\n\n24:11.240 --> 24:15.680\n of biosafety lab in the world, biosafety lab level four.\n\n24:15.680 --> 24:18.400\n And there are not a lot of BSL four labs in the world.\n\n24:18.400 --> 24:25.500\n There are things can and have leaked out of BSL four labs and some of the work that's\n\n24:25.500 --> 24:30.300\n been done with potentially annihilating pathogens, which we can talk about, it's actually done\n\n24:30.300 --> 24:32.000\n at BSL three.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:36.480\n And so fundamentally any lab can leak.\n\n24:36.480 --> 24:41.320\n We have proven ourselves to be incapable of creating a lab that is utterly impervious\n\n24:41.320 --> 24:42.560\n to leaks.\n\n24:42.560 --> 24:47.740\n So why in the world would we create something where if God forbid it leaked, could annihilate\n\n24:47.740 --> 24:48.740\n us all.\n\n24:48.740 --> 24:53.160\n And by the way, almost all of the measures that are taken in biosafety level anything\n\n24:53.160 --> 24:57.280\n labs are designed to prevent accidental leaks.\n\n24:57.280 --> 24:59.740\n What happens if you have a malevolent insider?\n\n24:59.740 --> 25:03.900\n We could talk about the psychology and the motivations of what would make a malevolent\n\n25:03.900 --> 25:07.480\n insider who wants to release something and not annihilating in a bit.\n\n25:07.480 --> 25:08.840\n I'm sure that we will.\n\n25:08.840 --> 25:11.980\n But what if you have a malevolent insider?\n\n25:11.980 --> 25:17.360\n Virtually none of the standards that go into biosafety level one, two, three, and four\n\n25:17.360 --> 25:20.480\n are about preventing somebody hijacking the process.\n\n25:20.480 --> 25:23.600\n Some of them are, but they're mainly designed against accidents.\n\n25:23.600 --> 25:25.740\n They're imperfect against accidents.\n\n25:25.740 --> 25:29.280\n And if this kind of work starts happening in lots and lots of labs with every lab you\n\n25:29.280 --> 25:34.040\n add, the odds of there being a malevolent inside are naturally increased arithmetically\n\n25:34.040 --> 25:36.100\n as the number of labs goes up.\n\n25:36.100 --> 25:44.360\n Now on the front of somebody outside of a government academic or scientific, traditional\n\n25:44.360 --> 25:50.620\n government, academic, scientific environment creating something malevolent, again, there's\n\n25:50.620 --> 25:57.840\n protections that we can take both at the level of syn bio architecture, hardening the entire\n\n25:57.840 --> 26:03.880\n syn bio ecosystem against terrible things being made that we don't want to have out\n\n26:03.880 --> 26:09.200\n there by rogue actors, to early detection, to lots and lots of other things that we can\n\n26:09.200 --> 26:11.680\n do to dramatically mitigate that risk.\n\n26:11.680 --> 26:16.240\n And I think we do both of those things, decide that no, we're not going to experimentally\n\n26:16.240 --> 26:22.520\n make annihilating pathogens in leaky labs, and B, yes, we are going to take countermeasures\n\n26:22.520 --> 26:28.760\n that are going to cost a fraction of our annual defense budget to preclude their creation,\n\n26:28.760 --> 26:31.780\n then I think both risks get managed down.\n\n26:31.780 --> 26:36.480\n But if you take one set of precautions and not the other, then the thing that you have\n\n26:36.480 --> 26:41.000\n not taken precautions against immediately becomes the more likely outcome.\n\n26:41.000 --> 26:45.720\n So can we talk about this kind of research and what's actually done and what are the\n\n26:45.720 --> 26:47.240\n positives and negatives of it?\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:52.560\n So if we look at gain of function research and the kind of stuff that's happening in\n\n26:52.560 --> 26:56.640\n level three and level four BSL labs, what's the whole idea here?\n\n26:56.640 --> 27:01.580\n Is it trying to engineer viruses to understand how they behave?\n\n27:01.580 --> 27:03.520\n You want to understand the dangerous ones.\n\n27:03.520 --> 27:04.520\n Yeah.\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:06.640\n So that would be the logic behind doing it.\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:10.560\n And so gain of function can mean a lot of different things.\n\n27:10.560 --> 27:15.480\n Viewed through a certain lens, gain of function research could be what you do when you create,\n\n27:15.480 --> 27:20.600\n you know, GMOs, when you create, you know, hearty strains of corn that are resistant\n\n27:20.600 --> 27:21.600\n to pesticides.\n\n27:21.600 --> 27:23.400\n I mean, you could view that as gain of function.\n\n27:23.400 --> 27:26.960\n So I'm going to refer to gain of function in a relatively narrow sense, which is actually\n\n27:26.960 --> 27:34.400\n the sense that the term is usually used, which is in some way magnifying capabilities of\n\n27:34.400 --> 27:40.720\n microorganisms to make them more dangerous, whether it's more transmissible or more deadly.\n\n27:40.720 --> 27:46.380\n And in that line of research, I'll use an example from 2011 because it's very illustrative\n\n27:46.380 --> 27:48.400\n and it's also very chilling.\n\n27:48.400 --> 27:54.120\n Back in 2011, two separate labs independently of one another, I assume there was some kind\n\n27:54.120 --> 27:57.700\n of communication between them, but they were basically independent projects, one in Holland\n\n27:57.700 --> 28:04.200\n and one in Wisconsin, did gain of function research on something called H5N1 flu.\n\n28:04.200 --> 28:11.480\n H5N1 is, you know, something that, at least on a lethality basis, makes COVID look like\n\n28:11.480 --> 28:12.480\n a kitten.\n\n28:12.480 --> 28:15.640\n You know, COVID, according to the World Health Organization, has a case fatality rate somewhere\n\n28:15.640 --> 28:21.480\n between half a percent and one percent, H5N1 is closer to 60 percent, six zero.\n\n28:21.480 --> 28:24.320\n And so that's actually even slightly more lethal than Ebola.\n\n28:24.320 --> 28:27.560\n It's a very, very, very scary pathogen.\n\n28:27.560 --> 28:33.180\n The good news about H5N1 is that it is barely, barely contagious.\n\n28:33.180 --> 28:36.320\n But I believe it is in no way contagious human to human.\n\n28:36.320 --> 28:44.940\n It requires, you know, very, very, very deep contact with birds, in most cases chickens.\n\n28:44.940 --> 28:49.240\n And so if you're a chicken farmer and you spend an enormous amount of time around them\n\n28:49.240 --> 28:54.960\n and perhaps you get into situations in which you get a break in your skin and you're interacting\n\n28:54.960 --> 29:01.960\n intensely with fowl who, as it turns out, have H5N1, that's when the jump comes.\n\n29:01.960 --> 29:05.480\n But it's not, there's no airborne transmission that we're aware of human to human.\n\n29:05.480 --> 29:08.480\n I mean, not that it just doesn't exist.\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:14.520\n I think the World Health Organization did a relentless survey of the number of H5N1\n\n29:14.520 --> 29:15.520\n cases.\n\n29:15.520 --> 29:16.520\n I think they do it every year.\n\n29:16.520 --> 29:22.160\n I saw one 10 year series where I think it was like 500 fatalities over the course of\n\n29:22.160 --> 29:23.160\n a decade.\n\n29:23.160 --> 29:24.160\n And that's a drop in the bucket.\n\n29:24.160 --> 29:30.720\n Kind of fun, fun fact, I believe the typical lethality from lightning over 10 years is\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:31.920\n 70,000 deaths.\n\n29:31.920 --> 29:37.200\n So we think getting struck by lightning, pretty low risk, H5N1 much, much lower than that.\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:43.560\n What happened in these experiments is the experimenters in both cases set out to make\n\n29:43.560 --> 29:48.400\n H5N1 that would be contagious, that could create airborne transmission.\n\n29:48.400 --> 29:52.980\n And so they basically passed it, I think in both cases, they passed it through a large\n\n29:52.980 --> 29:54.740\n number of ferrets.\n\n29:54.740 --> 29:58.220\n And so this wasn't like CRISPR, there wasn't even any CRISPR back in those days.\n\n29:58.220 --> 30:03.200\n This was relatively straightforward, selecting for a particular outcome.\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:07.240\n And after guiding the path and passing them through, again, I believe it was a series\n\n30:07.240 --> 30:08.240\n of ferrets.\n\n30:08.240 --> 30:14.680\n They did in fact come up with a version of H5N1 that is capable of airborne transmission.\n\n30:14.680 --> 30:17.400\n Now they didn't unleash it into the world.\n\n30:17.400 --> 30:20.680\n They didn't inject it into humans to see what would happen.\n\n30:20.680 --> 30:25.900\n And so for those two reasons, we don't really know how contagious it might have been.\n\n30:25.900 --> 30:33.520\n But if it was as contagious as COVID, that could be a civilization threatening pathogen.\n\n30:33.520 --> 30:34.720\n And why would you do it?\n\n30:34.720 --> 30:36.800\n Well, the people who did it were good guys.\n\n30:36.800 --> 30:38.320\n They were virologists.\n\n30:38.320 --> 30:43.560\n I believe their agenda as they explained it was much as you said, let's figure out what\n\n30:43.560 --> 30:47.920\n a worst case scenario might look like so we can understand it better.\n\n30:47.920 --> 30:52.860\n But my understanding is in both cases, it was done in BSL3 labs.\n\n30:52.860 --> 31:01.040\n And so potential of leak, significantly nonzero, hopefully way below 1% but significantly nonzero.\n\n31:01.040 --> 31:06.040\n And when you look at the consequences of an escape in terms of human lives, destruction\n\n31:06.040 --> 31:10.680\n of a large portion of the economy, et cetera, and you do an expected value calculation on\n\n31:10.680 --> 31:17.540\n whatever fraction of 1% that was, you would come up with a staggering cost, staggering\n\n31:17.540 --> 31:19.360\n expected cost for this work.\n\n31:19.360 --> 31:21.960\n So it should never have been carried out.\n\n31:21.960 --> 31:30.120\n Now you might make an argument if you said, if you believed that H5N1 in nature is on\n\n31:30.120 --> 31:35.800\n an inevitable path to airborne transmission, and it's only going to be a small number of\n\n31:35.800 --> 31:43.920\n years, A. And B, if it makes that transition, there is one set of changes to its metabolic\n\n31:43.920 --> 31:49.140\n pathways and its genomic code and so forth, one that we have discovered.\n\n31:49.140 --> 31:53.840\n So it is going to go from point A, which is where it is right now, to point B. We have\n\n31:53.840 --> 31:58.140\n reliably engineered point B. That is the destination.\n\n31:58.140 --> 32:02.080\n And we need to start fighting that right now because this is five years or less away.\n\n32:02.080 --> 32:03.520\n Now that'd be a very different world.\n\n32:03.520 --> 32:06.640\n That'd be like spotting an asteroid that's coming toward the earth and is five years\n\n32:06.640 --> 32:07.640\n off.\n\n32:07.640 --> 32:10.360\n And yes, you marshal everything you can to resist that.\n\n32:10.360 --> 32:12.640\n But there's two problems with that perspective.\n\n32:12.640 --> 32:17.160\n The first is, in however many thousands of generations that humans have been inhabiting\n\n32:17.160 --> 32:21.280\n this planet, there has never been a transmissible form of H5N1.\n\n32:21.280 --> 32:23.720\n And influenza has been around for a very long time.\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:30.240\n So there is no case for inevitability of this kind of a jump to airborne transmission.\n\n32:30.240 --> 32:33.600\n So we're not on a freight train to that outcome.\n\n32:33.600 --> 32:38.340\n And if there was inevitability around that, it's not like there's just one set of genetic\n\n32:38.340 --> 32:41.320\n code that would get there.\n\n32:41.320 --> 32:46.760\n There's all kinds of different mutations that could conceivably result in that kind of an\n\n32:46.760 --> 32:49.900\n outcome, unbelievable diversity of mutations.\n\n32:49.900 --> 32:54.400\n And so we're not actually creating something we're inevitably going to face, but we are\n\n32:54.400 --> 33:00.320\n creating something, we are creating a very powerful and unbelievably negative card and\n\n33:00.320 --> 33:04.460\n injecting it in the deck that nature never put into the deck.\n\n33:04.460 --> 33:11.180\n So in that case, I just don't see any moral or scientific justification for that kind\n\n33:11.180 --> 33:12.480\n of work.\n\n33:12.480 --> 33:18.200\n And interestingly, there was quite a bit of excitement and concern about this when the\n\n33:18.200 --> 33:19.200\n work came out.\n\n33:19.200 --> 33:22.960\n One of the teams was going to publish their results in Science, the other in Nature.\n\n33:22.960 --> 33:27.900\n And there were a lot of editorials and a lot of scientists are saying, this is crazy.\n\n33:27.900 --> 33:31.240\n And publication of those papers did get suspended.\n\n33:31.240 --> 33:36.120\n And not long after that, there was a pause put on US government funding, NIH funding\n\n33:36.120 --> 33:38.380\n on gain of function research.\n\n33:38.380 --> 33:41.840\n But both of those speed bumps were ultimately removed.\n\n33:41.840 --> 33:43.960\n Those papers did ultimately get published.\n\n33:43.960 --> 33:47.840\n And that pause on funding, you know, ceased long ago.\n\n33:47.840 --> 33:52.460\n And in fact, those two very projects, my understanding is resumed their funding, got their government\n\n33:52.460 --> 33:53.460\n funding back.\n\n33:53.460 --> 33:57.720\n I don't know why a Dutch project is getting NIH funding, but whatever, about a year and\n\n33:57.720 --> 33:58.900\n a half ago.\n\n33:58.900 --> 34:04.480\n So as far as the US government and regulators are concerned, it's all systems go for gain\n\n34:04.480 --> 34:07.720\n of function at this point, which I find very troubling.\n\n34:07.720 --> 34:11.480\n Now I'm a little bit of an outsider from this field, but it has echoes of the same kind\n\n34:11.480 --> 34:16.680\n of problem I see in the AI world with autonomous weapon systems.\n\n34:16.680 --> 34:25.080\n Nobody in my colleagues, my colleagues, friends, as far as I can tell, people in the AI community\n\n34:25.080 --> 34:31.480\n are not really talking about autonomous weapon systems as now US and China full steam ahead\n\n34:31.480 --> 34:33.200\n on the development of both.\n\n34:33.200 --> 34:37.120\n And that seems to be a similar kind of thing on gain of function.\n\n34:37.120 --> 34:42.920\n I've, you know, have friends in the biology space and they don't want to talk about gain\n\n34:42.920 --> 34:46.200\n of function publicly.\n\n34:46.200 --> 34:50.560\n And I don't, that makes me very uncomfortable from an outsider perspective in terms of gain\n\n34:50.560 --> 34:51.560\n of function.\n\n34:51.560 --> 34:56.920\n It makes me very uncomfortable from the insider perspective on autonomous weapon systems.\n\n34:56.920 --> 35:00.280\n I'm not sure how to communicate exactly about autonomous weapon systems.\n\n35:00.280 --> 35:04.120\n And I certainly don't know how to communicate effectively about gain of function.\n\n35:04.120 --> 35:06.240\n What is the right path forward here?\n\n35:06.240 --> 35:08.920\n Could we seize all gain of function research?\n\n35:08.920 --> 35:11.280\n Is that, is that really the solution here?\n\n35:11.280 --> 35:15.320\n Well, again, I'm going to use gain of function in the relatively narrow context of over assessing\n\n35:15.320 --> 35:19.680\n because you could say almost, you know, anything that you do to make biology more effective\n\n35:19.680 --> 35:20.680\n as gain of function.\n\n35:20.680 --> 35:27.000\n So within the narrow confines of what we're discussing, I think it would be easy enough\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:31.840\n for level headed people in all of the countries, level headed governmental people in all the\n\n35:31.840 --> 35:36.800\n countries that realistically could support such a program to agree, we don't want this\n\n35:36.800 --> 35:40.560\n to happen because all labs leak.\n\n35:40.560 --> 35:45.520\n I mean, and you know, an example that I use, I actually didn't use it in the piece I did\n\n35:45.520 --> 35:50.880\n with Sam Harris as well, is the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001.\n\n35:50.880 --> 35:57.280\n I mean, talk about an example of the least likely lab leaking into the least likely place.\n\n35:57.280 --> 36:03.000\n This was shortly after 9 11, folks who don't remember it, and it was a very, very lethal\n\n36:03.000 --> 36:08.640\n strand of anthrax that as it turned out, based on the forensic genomic work that was done\n\n36:08.640 --> 36:13.700\n and so forth, absolutely leaked from a high security US army lab.\n\n36:13.700 --> 36:17.480\n Probably the one at Fort Detrick in Maryland, it might've been another one, but who cares?\n\n36:17.480 --> 36:21.500\n It absolutely leaked from a high security US army lab.\n\n36:21.500 --> 36:22.880\n And where did it leak to?\n\n36:22.880 --> 36:28.160\n This highly dangerous substance that was kept under lock and key by a very security minded\n\n36:28.160 --> 36:29.160\n organization?\n\n36:29.160 --> 36:33.520\n Well, it leaked to places including the Senate majority leader's office, Tom Daschle's office,\n\n36:33.520 --> 36:38.080\n I think it was Senator Leahy's office, certain publications, including bizarrely the National\n\n36:38.080 --> 36:39.260\n Enquirer.\n\n36:39.260 --> 36:41.960\n But let's go to the Senate majority leader's office.\n\n36:41.960 --> 36:47.600\n It is hard to imagine a more security minded country than the United States two weeks after\n\n36:47.600 --> 36:49.080\n the 9 11 attack.\n\n36:49.080 --> 36:52.540\n I mean, it doesn't get more security minded than that.\n\n36:52.540 --> 36:59.080\n And it's also hard to imagine a more security capable organization than the United States\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:00.080\n military.\n\n37:00.080 --> 37:05.600\n We can joke all we want about inefficiencies in the military and $24,000 wrenches and so\n\n37:05.600 --> 37:08.560\n forth, but pretty capable when it comes to that.\n\n37:08.560 --> 37:16.740\n Despite that level of focus and concern and competence, just days after the 9 11 attack,\n\n37:16.740 --> 37:22.200\n something comes from the inside of our military industrial compacts and ends up in the office\n\n37:22.200 --> 37:26.000\n of someone I believe the Senate majority leader somewhere in the line of presidential succession.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:28.100\n It tells us everything can leak.\n\n37:28.100 --> 37:33.840\n So again, think of a level headed conversation between powerful leaders in a diversity of\n\n37:33.840 --> 37:40.360\n countries, thinking through like, I can imagine a very simple PowerPoint revealing, just discussing\n\n37:40.360 --> 37:46.680\n briefly things like the anthrax leak, things like this foot and mouth disease outbreak\n\n37:46.680 --> 37:52.440\n that or leaking that came out of a BSL four level lab in the UK, several other things\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:57.720\n talking about the utter virulence that could result from gain of function and say, folks,\n\n37:57.720 --> 38:01.080\n can we agree that this just shouldn't happen?\n\n38:01.080 --> 38:06.160\n I mean, if we were able to agree on the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which we were by\n\n38:06.160 --> 38:11.400\n a weapons convention, which we did agree on, we the world, for the most part, I believe\n\n38:11.400 --> 38:13.980\n agreement could be found there.\n\n38:13.980 --> 38:18.940\n But it's going to take people in leadership of a couple of very powerful countries to\n\n38:18.940 --> 38:22.900\n get to the consensus amongst them and then to decide we're going to get everybody together\n\n38:22.900 --> 38:24.640\n and browbeat them into banning this stuff.\n\n38:24.640 --> 38:28.680\n Now that doesn't make it entirely impossible that somebody might do this.\n\n38:28.680 --> 38:35.840\n But in well regulated, carefully watched over fiduciary environments like federally funded\n\n38:35.840 --> 38:41.880\n academic research, anything going on in the government itself, things going on in companies\n\n38:41.880 --> 38:47.000\n that have investors who don't want to go to jail for the rest of their lives.\n\n38:47.000 --> 38:50.400\n I think that would have a major, major dampening impact on it.\n\n38:50.400 --> 38:58.360\n But there is a particular possible catalyst in this time we live in, which is for really\n\n38:58.360 --> 39:02.640\n kind of raising the question of gain of function research for the application of virus making\n\n39:02.640 --> 39:05.200\n viruses more dangerous.\n\n39:05.200 --> 39:14.360\n Is the question of whether COVID leaked from a lab, sort of not even answering that question,\n\n39:14.360 --> 39:21.160\n but even asking that question is a very, it seems like a very important question to ask\n\n39:21.160 --> 39:26.440\n to catalyze the conversation about whether we should be doing gain of function research.\n\n39:26.440 --> 39:33.720\n I mean, from a high level, why do you think people, even colleagues of mine are not comfortable\n\n39:33.720 --> 39:35.360\n asking that question?\n\n39:35.360 --> 39:40.200\n And two, do you think that the answer could be that it did leak from a lab?\n\n39:40.200 --> 39:49.080\n I think the mere possibility that it did leak from a lab is evidence enough, again, for\n\n39:49.080 --> 39:54.640\n the hypothetical rational national leaders watching this simple PowerPoint.\n\n39:54.640 --> 40:00.460\n If you could put the possibility at 1% and you look at the unbelievable destructive power\n\n40:00.460 --> 40:06.240\n that COVID had, that should be an overwhelmingly powerful argument for excluding it.\n\n40:06.240 --> 40:12.360\n Now as to whether or not that was a leak, some very, very level, I don't know enough\n\n40:12.360 --> 40:18.160\n about all of the factors in the Bayesian analysis and so forth that has gone into people making\n\n40:18.160 --> 40:19.640\n the pro argument of that.\n\n40:19.640 --> 40:25.040\n So I don't pretend to be an expert on that and I don't have a point of view, I just don't\n\n40:25.040 --> 40:26.040\n know.\n\n40:26.040 --> 40:32.640\n But what we can say is it is entirely possible for a couple of reasons.\n\n40:32.640 --> 40:37.320\n One is that there is a BSL4 lab in Wuhan, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\n40:37.320 --> 40:44.440\n I believe it's the only BSL4 in China, I could be wrong about that, but it definitely had\n\n40:44.440 --> 40:52.520\n a history that alarmed very sophisticated US diplomats and others who were in contact\n\n40:52.520 --> 41:00.120\n with the lab and were aware of what it was doing long before COVID hit the world.\n\n41:00.120 --> 41:05.640\n And so there are diplomatic cables that have been declassified, I believe one sophisticated\n\n41:05.640 --> 41:10.720\n scientist or other observer said that WIV is a ticking time bomb.\n\n41:10.720 --> 41:16.120\n And I believe it's also been pretty reasonably established that coronaviruses were a topic\n\n41:16.120 --> 41:18.240\n of great interest at WIV.\n\n41:18.240 --> 41:22.320\n The SARS obviously came out of China and that's a coronavirus that would make an enormous\n\n41:22.320 --> 41:25.800\n amount of sense for it to be studied there.\n\n41:25.800 --> 41:32.880\n And there is so much opacity about what happened in the early days and weeks after the outbreak\n\n41:32.880 --> 41:38.200\n that's basically been imposed by the Chinese government that we just don't know.\n\n41:38.200 --> 41:43.680\n So it feels like a substantially or greater than 1% possibility to me looking at it from\n\n41:43.680 --> 41:45.360\n the outside.\n\n41:45.360 --> 41:47.800\n And that's something that one could imagine.\n\n41:47.800 --> 41:52.200\n Now we're going to the realm of thought experiment, not me decreeing this is what happened, but\n\n41:52.200 --> 41:58.200\n if they're studying coronavirus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there is this precedent\n\n41:58.200 --> 42:02.680\n of gain of function research that's been done on something that is remarkably uncontagious\n\n42:02.680 --> 42:06.920\n to humans, whereas we know coronavirus is contagious to humans, I could definitely...\n\n42:06.920 --> 42:12.660\n And there is this global consensus, certainly was the case two or three years ago when this\n\n42:12.660 --> 42:16.520\n work might've started, there seems to be this global consensus that gain of function is\n\n42:16.520 --> 42:17.520\n fine.\n\n42:17.520 --> 42:21.640\n The US paused funding for a little while, but paused funding, they never said private\n\n42:21.640 --> 42:25.720\n actors couldn't do it, it was just a pause of NIH funding.\n\n42:25.720 --> 42:26.960\n And then that pause was lifted.\n\n42:26.960 --> 42:28.840\n So again, none of this is irrational.\n\n42:28.840 --> 42:34.720\n You could certainly see the folks at WIV saying, gain of function, interesting vector, coronavirus\n\n42:34.720 --> 42:42.840\n unlike H5N1, very contagious, we're a nation that has had terrible run ins with coronavirus,\n\n42:42.840 --> 42:44.960\n why don't we do a little gain of function on this?\n\n42:44.960 --> 42:49.880\n And then like all labs at all levels, one could imagine this lab leaking.\n\n42:49.880 --> 42:55.040\n So it's not an impossibility and very, very level headed people have said that, who've\n\n42:55.040 --> 42:58.880\n looked at it much more deeply do believe in that outcome.\n\n42:58.880 --> 43:03.600\n Why is it such a threat to power the idea that it'll leak from a lab?\n\n43:03.600 --> 43:04.600\n Why is it so threatening?\n\n43:04.600 --> 43:08.840\n I don't maybe understand this point exactly.\n\n43:08.840 --> 43:14.060\n Is it just that as governments and especially the Chinese government is really afraid of\n\n43:14.060 --> 43:18.320\n admitting mistakes that everybody makes?\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:21.840\n So this is a horrible, like Chernobyl is a good example.\n\n43:21.840 --> 43:24.480\n I come from the Soviet Union.\n\n43:24.480 --> 43:29.240\n I mean, well, major mistakes were made in Chernobyl.\n\n43:29.240 --> 43:40.040\n I would argue for a lab leak to happen, the scale of the mistake is much smaller, right?\n\n43:40.040 --> 43:50.080\n The depth and the breadth of rot that in bureaucracy that led to Chernobyl is much bigger than\n\n43:50.080 --> 43:55.360\n anything that could lead to a lab leak, because it could literally just be, I mean, I'm sure\n\n43:55.360 --> 44:02.880\n there's security, very careful security procedures, even in level three labs, but it, I imagine\n\n44:02.880 --> 44:09.240\n maybe you can correct me, it's all it takes is the incompetence of a small number of individuals,\n\n44:09.240 --> 44:14.560\n one individual on a particular, a couple of weeks, three weeks period, as opposed to a\n\n44:14.560 --> 44:19.160\n multi year bureaucratic failure of the entire government.\n\n44:19.160 --> 44:20.160\n Right.\n\n44:20.160 --> 44:24.200\n Well, certainly the magnitude of mistakes and compounding mistakes that went into Chernobyl\n\n44:24.200 --> 44:30.720\n was far, far, far greater, but the consequence of COVID outweighs that, the consequences\n\n44:30.720 --> 44:34.000\n of Chernobyl to a tremendous degree.\n\n44:34.000 --> 44:43.600\n And I think that particularly authoritarian governments are unbelievably reluctant to\n\n44:43.600 --> 44:49.160\n admit to any fallibility whatsoever, and there's a long, long history of that across dozens\n\n44:49.160 --> 44:56.080\n and dozens of authoritarian governments, and to be transparent, again, this is in the hypothetical\n\n44:56.080 --> 45:00.640\n world in which this was a leak, which again, I don't have, I don't personally have enough\n\n45:00.640 --> 45:04.480\n sophistication to have an opinion on the, on the likelihood, but in the hypothetical\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:14.360\n world in which it was a leak, the global reaction and the amount of global animus and the amount\n\n45:14.360 --> 45:22.440\n of, you know, the decline in global respect that would happen toward China, because every\n\n45:22.440 --> 45:28.480\n country suffered massively from this, unbelievable damages in terms of human lives and economic\n\n45:28.480 --> 45:35.200\n activity disrupted, the world would in some way present China with that bill.\n\n45:35.200 --> 45:41.160\n And when you take on top of that, the natural disinclination for any authoritarian government\n\n45:41.160 --> 45:46.960\n to admit any fallibility and tolerate the possibility of any fallibility whatsoever,\n\n45:46.960 --> 45:51.520\n and you look at the relative opacity, even though they let a world health organization\n\n45:51.520 --> 45:56.720\n group in, you know, a couple of months ago to run around, they didn't give that who group\n\n45:56.720 --> 46:01.600\n anywhere near the level of access that would be necessary to definitively say X happened\n\n46:01.600 --> 46:02.600\n versus Y.\n\n46:02.600 --> 46:08.400\n The level of opacity that surrounds those opening weeks and months of COVID in China,\n\n46:08.400 --> 46:10.440\n we just don't know.\n\n46:10.440 --> 46:17.840\n If you were to kind of look back at 2020 and maybe broadening it out to future pandemics\n\n46:17.840 --> 46:24.760\n that could be much more dangerous, what kind of response, how do we fail in a response\n\n46:24.760 --> 46:27.560\n and how could we do better?\n\n46:27.560 --> 46:35.560\n So the gain of function research is discussing the question of we should not be creating\n\n46:35.560 --> 46:41.320\n viruses that are both exceptionally contagious and exceptionally deadly to humans.\n\n46:41.320 --> 46:48.200\n But if it does happen, perhaps the natural evolution, natural mutation, is there interesting\n\n46:48.200 --> 46:56.040\n technological responses on the testing side, on the vaccine development side, on the collection\n\n46:56.040 --> 47:02.680\n of data or on the basic sort of policy response side or the sociological, the psychological\n\n47:02.680 --> 47:03.680\n side?\n\n47:03.680 --> 47:05.680\n Yeah, there's all kinds of things.\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:11.280\n And most of what I've thought about and written about and again discussed in that long bit\n\n47:11.280 --> 47:14.920\n with Sam is dual use.\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:20.040\n So most of the countermeasures that I've been thinking about and advocating for would be\n\n47:20.040 --> 47:26.840\n every bit as effective against zoonotic disease and natural pandemic of some sort as an artificial\n\n47:26.840 --> 47:27.840\n one.\n\n47:27.840 --> 47:32.900\n The risk of an artificial one, even the near term risk of an artificial one, ups the urgency\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:37.540\n around these measures immensely, but most of them would be broadly applicable.\n\n47:37.540 --> 47:43.440\n And so I think the first thing that we really want to do on a global scale is have a far,\n\n47:43.440 --> 47:49.720\n far, far more robust and globally transparent system of detection.\n\n47:49.720 --> 47:52.080\n And that can happen on a number of levels.\n\n47:52.080 --> 47:58.200\n The most obvious one is just in the blood of people who come into clinics exhibiting\n\n47:58.200 --> 48:00.280\n signs of illness.\n\n48:00.280 --> 48:07.600\n And we are certainly at a point now where at with relatively minimal investment, we\n\n48:07.600 --> 48:12.880\n could develop in clinic diagnostics that would be unbelievably effective at pinpointing what's\n\n48:12.880 --> 48:19.080\n going on in almost any disease when somebody walks into a doctor's office or a clinic.\n\n48:19.080 --> 48:24.920\n And better than that, this is a little bit further off, but it wouldn't cost tens of\n\n48:24.920 --> 48:28.880\n billions in research dollars, it would be a relatively modest and affordable budget\n\n48:28.880 --> 48:36.000\n in relation to the threat at home diagnostics that can really, really pinpoint, okay, particularly\n\n48:36.000 --> 48:41.480\n with respiratory infections, because that is generally almost universally the mechanism\n\n48:41.480 --> 48:44.680\n of transmission for any serious pandemic.\n\n48:44.680 --> 48:49.760\n So somebody has a respiratory infection, is it one of the, you know, significantly large\n\n48:49.760 --> 48:55.440\n handful of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and other things that cause common cold?\n\n48:55.440 --> 48:56.440\n Or is it influenza?\n\n48:56.440 --> 49:00.000\n If it's influenza, is it influenza A versus B?\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:06.640\n Or is it, you know, a small handful of other more exotic but nonetheless sort of common\n\n49:06.640 --> 49:09.360\n respiratory infections that are out there?\n\n49:09.360 --> 49:12.960\n Having a diagnostic panel to pinpoint all of that stuff, that's something that's well\n\n49:12.960 --> 49:14.060\n within our capabilities.\n\n49:14.060 --> 49:19.060\n That's much less a lift than creating mRNA vaccines, which obviously we proved capable\n\n49:19.060 --> 49:21.200\n of when we put our minds to it.\n\n49:21.200 --> 49:24.360\n So do that on a global basis.\n\n49:24.360 --> 49:28.760\n And I don't think that's irrational because the best prototype for this that I'm aware\n\n49:28.760 --> 49:34.640\n of isn't currently rolling out in Atherton, California, or Fairfield County, Connecticut,\n\n49:34.640 --> 49:36.300\n or some other wealthy place.\n\n49:36.300 --> 49:40.140\n The best prototype that I'm aware of this is rolling out right now in Nigeria.\n\n49:40.140 --> 49:45.060\n And it's a project that came out of the Broad Institute, which is, as I'm sure you know,\n\n49:45.060 --> 49:49.580\n but some listeners may not, is kind of like an academic joint venture between Harvard\n\n49:49.580 --> 49:50.920\n and MIT.\n\n49:50.920 --> 49:53.360\n The program is called Sentinel.\n\n49:53.360 --> 49:59.280\n And their objective is, and their plan is a very well conceived plan, a methodical plan,\n\n49:59.280 --> 50:05.480\n is to do just that in areas of Nigeria that are particularly vulnerable to zoonotic diseases\n\n50:05.480 --> 50:08.040\n making the jump from animals to humans.\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:12.000\n But also there's just an unbelievable public health benefit from that.\n\n50:12.000 --> 50:17.020\n And it's sort of a three tier system where clinicians in the field could very rapidly\n\n50:17.020 --> 50:22.220\n determine do you have one of the infections of acute interest here, either because it's\n\n50:22.220 --> 50:26.800\n very common in this region, so we want to diagnose as many things as we can at the front\n\n50:26.800 --> 50:31.360\n line, or because it's uncommon but unbelievably threatening like Ebola.\n\n50:31.360 --> 50:35.500\n So front line worker can make that determination very, very rapidly.\n\n50:35.500 --> 50:41.020\n If it comes up as a we don't know, they bump it up to a level that's more like at a fully\n\n50:41.020 --> 50:44.080\n configured doctor's office or local hospital.\n\n50:44.080 --> 50:47.900\n And if it's still at a we don't know, it gets bumped up to a national level.\n\n50:47.900 --> 50:51.240\n And it gets bumped very, very rapidly.\n\n50:51.240 --> 50:57.340\n So if this can be done in Nigeria, and it seems that it can be, there shouldn't be any\n\n50:57.340 --> 51:00.880\n inhibition for it to happen in most other places.\n\n51:00.880 --> 51:03.300\n And it should be affordable from a budgetary standpoint.\n\n51:03.300 --> 51:07.800\n And based on Sentinel's budget and adjusting things for things like very different cost\n\n51:07.800 --> 51:13.120\n of living, larger population, et cetera, I did a back of the envelope calculation that\n\n51:13.120 --> 51:17.200\n doing something like Sentinel in the US would be in the low billions of dollars.\n\n51:17.200 --> 51:22.120\n And wealthy countries, middle income countries can't afford such a thing.\n\n51:22.120 --> 51:25.680\n Lower income countries should certainly be helped with that.\n\n51:25.680 --> 51:27.760\n But start with that level of detection.\n\n51:27.760 --> 51:33.720\n And then layer on top of that other interesting things like monitoring search engine traffic,\n\n51:33.720 --> 51:39.660\n search engine queries for evidence that strange clusters of symptoms are starting to rise\n\n51:39.660 --> 51:40.660\n in different places.\n\n51:40.660 --> 51:43.520\n There's been a lot of work done with that.\n\n51:43.520 --> 51:47.720\n Most of it kind of academic and experimental, but some of it has been powerful enough to\n\n51:47.720 --> 51:51.200\n suggest that this could be a very powerful early warning system.\n\n51:51.200 --> 51:56.760\n There's a guy named Bill Lampos at University College London who basically did a very rigorous\n\n51:56.760 --> 52:05.000\n analysis that showed that symptom searches reliably predicted COVID outbreaks in the\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:10.160\n early days of the pandemic in given countries by as much as 16 days before the evidence\n\n52:10.160 --> 52:12.320\n started to accrue at a public health level.\n\n52:12.320 --> 52:18.960\n 16 days of forewarning can be monumentally important in the early days of an outbreak.\n\n52:18.960 --> 52:26.640\n And this is a very, very talented, but nonetheless very resource constrained academic project.\n\n52:26.640 --> 52:31.000\n Even if that was something that was done with a NORAD like budget.\n\n52:31.000 --> 52:35.520\n So starting with detection, that's something we could do radically, radically better.\n\n52:35.520 --> 52:39.800\n So aggregating multiple data sources in order to create something, I mean, this is really\n\n52:39.800 --> 52:44.840\n exciting to me, the possibility that I've heard inklings of creating almost like a weather\n\n52:44.840 --> 52:54.140\n map of pathogens, like basically aggregating all of these data sources, scaling many orders\n\n52:54.140 --> 53:00.000\n of magnitude up at home testing and all kinds of testing that doesn't just try to test for\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:06.320\n the particular pathogen of worry now, but everything like a full spectrum of things\n\n53:06.320 --> 53:09.040\n that could be dangerous to the human body.\n\n53:09.040 --> 53:14.900\n And thereby be able to create these maps like that are dynamically updated on an hourly\n\n53:14.900 --> 53:19.520\n basis of how viruses travel throughout the world.\n\n53:19.520 --> 53:23.400\n And so you can respond, like you can then integrate just like you do when you check\n\n53:23.400 --> 53:28.880\n your weather map and it's raining or not, of course, not perfect, but it's very good\n\n53:28.880 --> 53:34.320\n predictor whether it's going to rain or not and use that to then make decisions about\n\n53:34.320 --> 53:38.840\n your own life, ultimately give the power information to individuals to respond.\n\n53:38.840 --> 53:44.160\n And if it's a super dangerous, like if it's acid rain versus regular rain, you might want\n\n53:44.160 --> 53:47.480\n to really stay inside as opposed to risking it.\n\n53:47.480 --> 53:54.400\n And that, just like you said, if I think it's not very expensive relative to all the things\n\n53:54.400 --> 54:00.440\n that we do in this world, but it does require bold leadership.\n\n54:00.440 --> 54:05.420\n And there's another dark thing, which really has bothered me about 2020, which it requires\n\n54:05.420 --> 54:13.200\n is it requires trust in institutions to carry out these kinds of programs and requires trust\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:20.480\n in science and engineers and sort of centralized organizations that would operate at scale\n\n54:20.480 --> 54:21.480\n here.\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:27.800\n And much of that trust has been, at least in the United States, diminished.\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:33.220\n It feels like I'm not exactly sure where to place the blame, but I do place quite a bit\n\n54:33.220 --> 54:40.160\n of the blame into the scientific community and again, my fellow colleagues in speaking\n\n54:40.160 --> 54:46.420\n down to people at times, speaking from authority, it sounded like it dismissed the basic human\n\n54:46.420 --> 54:52.560\n experience or the basic common humanity of people in a way to like, it almost sounded\n\n54:52.560 --> 54:58.200\n like there's an agenda that's hidden behind the words the scientists spoke.\n\n54:58.200 --> 55:03.200\n Like they're trying to, in a self preserving way, control the population or something like\n\n55:03.200 --> 55:04.200\n that.\n\n55:04.200 --> 55:07.400\n I don't think any of that is true from the majority of the scientific community, but\n\n55:07.400 --> 55:08.820\n it sounded that way.\n\n55:08.820 --> 55:16.040\n And so the trust began to diminish and I'm not sure how to fix that except to be more\n\n55:16.040 --> 55:22.840\n authentic, be more real, acknowledge the uncertainties under which we operate, acknowledge the mistakes\n\n55:22.840 --> 55:26.520\n that scientists make, that institutions make.\n\n55:26.520 --> 55:32.000\n The leak from the lab is a perfect example where we have imperfect systems that make\n\n55:32.000 --> 55:34.060\n all the progress we see in the world.\n\n55:34.060 --> 55:39.480\n And that being honest about that imperfection, I think is essential for forming trust.\n\n55:39.480 --> 55:45.280\n But I don't know what to make of it has been deeply disappointing because I do think just\n\n55:45.280 --> 55:53.240\n like you mentioned, the solutions require people to trust the institutions with their\n\n55:53.240 --> 55:54.240\n data.\n\n55:54.240 --> 55:55.240\n Yeah.\n\n55:55.240 --> 55:59.920\n And I think part of the problem is it seems to me as an outsider that there was a bizarre\n\n55:59.920 --> 56:08.560\n unwillingness on the part of the CDC and other institutions to admit to, to frame and to\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:11.300\n contextualize uncertainty.\n\n56:11.300 --> 56:16.800\n Maybe they had a patronizing idea that these people need to be told and when they're told,\n\n56:16.800 --> 56:21.660\n they need to be told with authority and a level of definitiveness and certain certitude\n\n56:21.660 --> 56:23.680\n that doesn't actually exist.\n\n56:23.680 --> 56:29.400\n And so when they whipsaw on recommendations like what you should do about masks, when\n\n56:29.400 --> 56:35.560\n the CDC is kind of at the very beginning of the pandemic saying, masks don't do anything.\n\n56:35.560 --> 56:36.820\n Don't wear them.\n\n56:36.820 --> 56:41.700\n When the real driver for that was we don't want these clowns going out and depleting\n\n56:41.700 --> 56:49.240\n Amazon of masks because they may be needed in medical settings and we just don't know\n\n56:49.240 --> 56:50.240\n yet.\n\n56:50.240 --> 56:54.360\n I think a message that actually respected people and said, this is why we're asking\n\n56:54.360 --> 57:00.080\n you not to do masks yet and there's more to be seen would be less whipsawing and would\n\n57:00.080 --> 57:04.580\n bring people like they feel more like they're part of the conversation and they're being\n\n57:04.580 --> 57:09.480\n treated like adults than saying one day definitively masks suck.\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:13.120\n And then X days later saying, nope, they haven't wear masks.\n\n57:13.120 --> 57:16.960\n And so I think framing things in terms of the probabilities, which most people are easy\n\n57:16.960 --> 57:17.960\n to parse.\n\n57:17.960 --> 57:23.520\n I mean, a more recent example, which I just thought was batty was suspending the Johnson\n\n57:23.520 --> 57:30.660\n and Johnson vaccine for a very low single digit number of days in the United States\n\n57:30.660 --> 57:38.240\n based on the fact that I believe there had been seven ish clotting incidents in roughly\n\n57:38.240 --> 57:43.680\n seven million people who had had the vaccine administered, I believe one of which resulted\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:45.560\n in a fatality.\n\n57:45.560 --> 57:50.100\n And there was definitely suggestive data that indicated that there was a relationship.\n\n57:50.100 --> 57:53.800\n This wasn't just coincidental because I think all of the clotting incidents happened in\n\n57:53.800 --> 57:58.400\n women as opposed to men and kind of clustered in a certain age group.\n\n57:58.400 --> 58:05.420\n But does that call for shutting off the vaccine or does it call for leveling with the American\n\n58:05.420 --> 58:10.480\n public and saying we've had one fatality out of seven million?\n\n58:10.480 --> 58:18.640\n This is, let's just assume substantially less than the likelihood of getting struck by lightning.\n\n58:18.640 --> 58:22.940\n Based on that information, and we're going to keep you posted because you can trust us\n\n58:22.940 --> 58:27.120\n to keep you posted, based on that information, please decide whether you're comfortable with\n\n58:27.120 --> 58:29.340\n a Johnson and Johnson vaccine.\n\n58:29.340 --> 58:33.160\n That would have been one response and I think people would have been able to parse the simple\n\n58:33.160 --> 58:35.200\n bits of data and make their own judgment.\n\n58:35.200 --> 58:41.680\n By turning it off, all of a sudden there's this dramatic signal to people who don't read\n\n58:41.680 --> 58:45.880\n all 900 words in the New York Times piece that explains why it's being turned off but\n\n58:45.880 --> 58:48.680\n just see the headline, which is a majority of people.\n\n58:48.680 --> 58:54.480\n There's a sudden like, oh my God, yikes, vaccine being shut off.\n\n58:54.480 --> 58:58.120\n And then all the people who sat on the fence or are sitting on the fence about whether\n\n58:58.120 --> 59:03.360\n or not they trust vaccines, that is going to push an incalculable number of people.\n\n59:03.360 --> 59:06.800\n That's going to be the last straw for we don't know how many hundreds of thousands or more\n\n59:06.800 --> 59:11.520\n likely millions of people to say, okay, tipping point here, I don't trust these vaccines.\n\n59:11.520 --> 59:16.940\n By pausing that for whatever it was, 10 or 12 days, and then flipping the switch as everybody\n\n59:16.940 --> 59:21.200\n who knew much about the situation knew was inevitable.\n\n59:21.200 --> 59:28.080\n By flipping the on switch 12 days later, you're conveying certitude J and J bad to certitude\n\n59:28.080 --> 59:33.040\n J and J good in a period of just a few days and people just feel whipsawed and they're\n\n59:33.040 --> 59:34.040\n not part of the analysis.\n\n59:34.040 --> 59:36.600\n But it's not just the whipsawing.\n\n59:36.600 --> 59:39.960\n And I think about this quite a bit, I don't think I have good answers.\n\n59:39.960 --> 59:43.400\n It's something about the way the communication actually happens.\n\n59:43.400 --> 59:49.820\n Just I don't know what it is about Anthony Fauci, for example, but I don't trust him.\n\n59:49.820 --> 59:55.840\n And I think that has to do, I mean, he has an incredible background.\n\n59:55.840 --> 59:59.100\n I'm sure he's a brilliant scientist and researcher.\n\n59:59.100 --> 1:00:06.360\n I'm sure he's also a great, like inside the room, policymaker and deliberator and so on.\n\n1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:14.280\n But what makes a great leader is something about that thing that you can't quite describe,\n\n1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:22.560\n but being a communicator that you know you can trust, that there's an authenticity that's\n\n1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:23.560\n required.\n\n1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:29.200\n And I'm not sure, maybe I'm being a bit too judgmental, but I'm a huge fan of a lot of\n\n1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:31.080\n great leaders throughout history.\n\n1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:36.960\n They've communicated exceptionally well in the way that Fauci does not.\n\n1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:40.600\n And I think about that, I think about what does affect the science communication.\n\n1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:47.280\n So great leaders throughout history did not necessarily need to be great science communicators.\n\n1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:49.680\n Their leadership was in other domains.\n\n1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:53.840\n But when you're fighting the virus, you also have to be a great science communicator.\n\n1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:58.120\n You have to be able to communicate uncertainties, you have to be able to communicate something\n\n1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:03.720\n like a vaccine that you're allowing inside your body into the messiness, into the complexity\n\n1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:08.160\n of the biology system, that if we're being honest, it's so complex we'll never be able\n\n1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:10.920\n to really understand.\n\n1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.880\n We can only desperately hope that science can give us sort of a high likelihood that\n\n1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:22.600\n there's no short term negative consequences and that kind of intuition about long term\n\n1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:29.000\n negative consequences and doing our best in this battle against trillions of things that\n\n1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.600\n are trying to kill us.\n\n1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:36.840\n Being an effective communicator in that space is very difficult, but I think about what\n\n1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:41.960\n it takes because I think there should be more science communicators that are effective at\n\n1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:43.720\n that kind of thing.\n\n1:01:43.720 --> 1:01:49.920\n Let me ask you about something that's sort of more in the AI space that I think about\n\n1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:58.480\n that kind of goes along this thread that you've spoken about, about democratizing the technology\n\n1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:05.760\n that could destroy human civilization, is from amazing work from DeepMind AlphaFold2,\n\n1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:12.400\n which achieved incredible performance on the protein folding problem, single protein folding\n\n1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:13.400\n problem.\n\n1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:22.000\n When you think about the use of AI in the SYN biospace, I think the gain of function\n\n1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:28.440\n in the virus space research that you referred to, I think is natural mutations and sort\n\n1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:35.560\n of aggressively mutating the virus until you get one that like that has this both contagious\n\n1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:45.960\n and deadly, but what about then using AI to, through simulation, be able to compute deadly\n\n1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:49.540\n viruses or any kind of biological systems?\n\n1:02:49.540 --> 1:02:53.080\n Is this something you're worried about, or again, is this something you're more excited\n\n1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:54.080\n about?\n\n1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:58.920\n I think computational biology is unbelievably exciting and promising field, and I think\n\n1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:05.960\n when you're doing things in silico as opposed to in vivo, the dangers plummet.\n\n1:03:05.960 --> 1:03:10.160\n You don't have a critter that can leak from a leaky lab.\n\n1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:15.320\n So I don't see any problem with that, except I do worry about the data security dimension\n\n1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:21.200\n of it, because if you were doing really, really interesting in silico gain of function research\n\n1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:27.120\n and you hit upon through a level of sophistication, we don't currently have, but synthetic biology\n\n1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:32.400\n is an exponential technology, so capabilities that are utterly out of reach today will be\n\n1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.740\n attainable in five or six years.\n\n1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:44.160\n I think if you conjured up worst case genomes of viruses that don't exist in vivo anywhere,\n\n1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.840\n they're just in the computer space, but like, hey guys, this is the genetic sequence that\n\n1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:56.120\n would end the world, let's say, then you have to worry about the utter hackability of every\n\n1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.600\n computer network we can imagine.\n\n1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:04.780\n Data leaks from the least likely places on the grandest possible scales have happened\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:09.000\n and continue to happen and will probably always continue to happen, and so that would be the\n\n1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.800\n danger of doing the work in silico.\n\n1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:16.240\n If you end up with a list of like, well, these are things we never want to see, that list\n\n1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:20.640\n leaks, and after the passage of some time, certainly couldn't be done today, but after\n\n1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:26.280\n the passage of some time, lots and lots of people in academic labs going all the way\n\n1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:33.600\n down to the high school level are in a position to make it overly simplistic, hit print on\n\n1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:37.720\n a genome and have the virus bearing that genome pop out on the other end and you've got something\n\n1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:42.880\n to worry about, but in general, computational biology I think is incredibly important, particularly\n\n1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:47.200\n because the crushing majority of work that people are doing with the protein folding\n\n1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:52.560\n problem and other things are about creating therapeutics, about creating things that will\n\n1:04:52.560 --> 1:04:58.680\n help us live better, live longer, thrive, be more well, and so forth, and the protein\n\n1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:04.520\n folding problem is a monstrous computational challenge that we seem to make just the most\n\n1:05:04.520 --> 1:05:09.320\n glacial project on, I'm sorry, progress on for years and years, but I think there's a\n\n1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:17.560\n biannual competition I think for which people tackle the protein folding problem, and Deep\n\n1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:25.240\n Mind's entrant both two years ago, like in 2018 and 2020, ruled the field, and so protein\n\n1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:29.520\n folding is an unbelievably important thing if you want to start thinking about therapeutics\n\n1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:34.600\n because it's the folding of the protein that tells us where the channels and the receptors\n\n1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:39.960\n and everything else are on that protein, and it's from that precise model, if we can get\n\n1:05:39.960 --> 1:05:46.840\n to a precise model, that you can start barraging it again in silicone with thousands, tens\n\n1:05:46.840 --> 1:05:52.520\n of thousands, millions of potential therapeutics and see what resolves the problems, the shortcomings\n\n1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:59.640\n that a misshapen protein, for instance, somebody with cystic fibrosis, how might we treat\n\n1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:00.640\n that?\n\n1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:01.640\n So I see nothing but good in that.\n\n1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:06.240\n Well, let me ask you about fear and hope in this world.\n\n1:06:06.240 --> 1:06:15.520\n I tend to believe that in terms of competence and malevolence, that people who are, maybe\n\n1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:20.240\n it's in my interactions, I tend to see that, first of all, I believe that most people are\n\n1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:27.640\n good and want to do good and are just better at doing good and more inclined to do good\n\n1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:35.600\n on this world, and more than that, people who are malevolent are usually incompetent\n\n1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:38.080\n at building technology.\n\n1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:43.080\n So I've seen this in my life, that people who are exceptionally good at stuff, no matter\n\n1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:50.500\n what the stuff is, tend to, maybe they discover joy in life in a way that gives them fulfillment\n\n1:06:50.500 --> 1:06:55.100\n and thereby does not result in them wanting to destroy the world.\n\n1:06:55.100 --> 1:07:00.000\n So like the better you are at stuff, whether that's building nuclear weapons or plumbing,\n\n1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.800\n doesn't matter, the both, the less likely you are to destroy the world.\n\n1:07:03.800 --> 1:07:14.500\n So in that sense, with many technologies, AI especially, I always think that the malevolent\n\n1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:18.560\n would be far outnumbered by the ultra competent.\n\n1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:27.080\n And in that sense, the defenses will always be stronger than the offense in terms of the\n\n1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:28.640\n people trying to destroy the world.\n\n1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:33.940\n Now there's a few spaces where that might not be the case, and that's an interesting\n\n1:07:33.940 --> 1:07:40.240\n conversation where this one person who's not very competent can destroy the whole world.\n\n1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:47.240\n Perhaps Symbio is one such space because of the exponential effects of the technology.\n\n1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:54.360\n I tend to believe AI is not one of the such spaces, but do you share this kind of view\n\n1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:58.720\n that the ultra competent are usually also the good?\n\n1:07:58.720 --> 1:07:59.720\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:04.600\n I absolutely share that and that gives me a great deal of optimism that we will be able\n\n1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:10.300\n to short circuit the threat that malevolence and Symbio could pose to us.\n\n1:08:10.300 --> 1:08:14.760\n But we need to start creating those defensive systems or defensive layers, one of which\n\n1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:18.880\n we talked about far, far, far better surveillance in order to prevail.\n\n1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:26.840\n So the good guys will almost inevitably outsmart and definitely outnumber the bad guys in most\n\n1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:29.640\n sort of smack downs that we can imagine.\n\n1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:34.800\n But the good guys aren't going to be able to exert their advantages unless they have\n\n1:08:34.800 --> 1:08:40.740\n the imagination necessary to think about what the worst possible thing can be done by somebody\n\n1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:45.080\n whose own psychology is completely alien to their own.\n\n1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:47.560\n So that's a tricky, tricky thing to solve for.\n\n1:08:47.560 --> 1:08:54.420\n Now in terms of whether the asymmetric power that a bad guy might have in the face of the\n\n1:08:54.420 --> 1:09:00.080\n overwhelming numerical advantage and competence advantage that the good guys have, unfortunately,\n\n1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:04.040\n I look at something like mass shootings as an example.\n\n1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:08.880\n I'm sure the guy who was responsible for the Vegas shooting or the Orlando shooting or\n\n1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:14.360\n any other shooting that we can imagine didn't know a whole lot about ballistics.\n\n1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:20.200\n And the number of good guy citizens in the United States with guns compared to bad guy\n\n1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:25.780\n citizens I'm sure is a crushingly overwhelmingly high ratio in favor of the good guys.\n\n1:09:25.780 --> 1:09:30.360\n But that doesn't make it possible for us to stop mass shootings.\n\n1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:38.280\n An example is Fort Hood, 45,000 trained soldiers on that base, yet there have been two mass\n\n1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:40.180\n shootings there.\n\n1:09:40.180 --> 1:09:48.080\n And so there is an asymmetry when you have powerful and lethal technology that gets so\n\n1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:54.880\n democratized and so proliferated in tools that are very, very easy to use even by a\n\n1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:56.240\n knucklehead.\n\n1:09:56.240 --> 1:10:00.780\n When those tools get really easy to use by a knucklehead and they're really widespread,\n\n1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:06.200\n it becomes very, very hard to defend against all instances of usage.\n\n1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:11.080\n Now the good news, quote unquote, about mass shootings, if there is any, and there is some,\n\n1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:17.880\n is even the most brutal and carefully planning and well armed mass shooter can only take\n\n1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:20.400\n so many victims.\n\n1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:26.040\n And the same is true, there's been four instances that I'm aware of, of commercial pilots committing\n\n1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:29.540\n suicide by downing their planes and taking all their passengers with them.\n\n1:10:29.540 --> 1:10:33.880\n These weren't Boeing engineers, but like an army of Boeing engineers ultimately were not\n\n1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:36.120\n capable of preventing that.\n\n1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:40.720\n But even in their case, and I'm actually not counting 9 11 and that, 9 11 is a different\n\n1:10:40.720 --> 1:10:45.040\n category in my mind, these are just personally suicidal pilots.\n\n1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:50.300\n In those cases, they only have a plain load of people that they're able to take with them.\n\n1:10:50.300 --> 1:10:57.800\n If we imagine a highly plausible and imaginable future in which some bio tools that are amoral,\n\n1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:04.480\n that could be used for good or for ill, start embodying unbelievable sophistication and\n\n1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:12.200\n genius in the tool, in the easier and easier and easier to make tool, all those thousands,\n\n1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:16.780\n tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of scientist years start getting embodied in\n\n1:11:16.780 --> 1:11:21.960\n something that may be as simple as hitting a print button.\n\n1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:29.440\n Then that good guy technology can be hijacked by a bad person and used in a very asymmetric\n\n1:11:29.440 --> 1:11:30.440\n way.\n\n1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:35.560\n What happens though, as you go to the high school student from the current very specific\n\n1:11:35.560 --> 1:11:41.300\n set of labs that are able to do it, as it becomes more and more democratized, as it\n\n1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:48.920\n becomes easier and easier to do this kind of large scale damage with an engineered virus,\n\n1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:53.280\n the more and more there will be engineering of defenses against these systems is some\n\n1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:56.840\n of the things we talked about in terms of testing, in terms of collection of data, but\n\n1:11:56.840 --> 1:12:05.040\n also in terms of at scale contact tracing or also engineering of vaccines in a matter\n\n1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:09.440\n of days, maybe hours, maybe minutes.\n\n1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:15.160\n I feel like the defenses, that's what human species seems to do, is we keep hitting the\n\n1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:22.040\n snooze button until there's a storm on the horizon heading towards us.\n\n1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:29.080\n Then we start to quickly build up the defenses or the response that's proportional to the\n\n1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:31.640\n scale of the storm.\n\n1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:38.840\n Of course, again, certain kinds of exponential threats require us to build up the defenses\n\n1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:42.120\n way earlier than we usually do, and that's I guess the question.\n\n1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:48.900\n But I ultimately am hopeful that the natural process of hitting the snooze button until\n\n1:12:48.900 --> 1:12:53.240\n the deadline is right in front of us will work out for quite a long time for us humans.\n\n1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:54.740\n And I fully agree.\n\n1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:59.320\n That's why I'm fundamentally, I may not sound like it thus far, but I'm fundamentally very,\n\n1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:04.480\n very optimistic about our ability to short circuit this threat because there is, again,\n\n1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:11.280\n I'll stress the technological feasibility and the profound affordability of a relatively\n\n1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:17.360\n simple set of steps that we can take to preclude it, but we do have to take those steps.\n\n1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:22.840\n What I'm hoping to do and trying to do is inject a notion of what those steps are into\n\n1:13:22.840 --> 1:13:27.360\n the public conversation and do my small part to up the odds that that actually ends up\n\n1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:30.320\n happening.\n\n1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:37.140\n The danger with this one is it is exponential, and I think that our minds are fundamentally\n\n1:13:37.140 --> 1:13:40.280\n struggle to understand exponential math.\n\n1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:42.440\n It's just not something we're wired for.\n\n1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.760\n Our ancestors didn't confront exponential processes when they were growing up on the\n\n1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:52.120\n savanna, so it's not something that's intuitive to us and our intuitions are reliably defeated\n\n1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:54.000\n when exponential processes come along.\n\n1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.020\n So that's issue number one.\n\n1:13:56.020 --> 1:14:02.840\n And issue number two with something like this is it kind of only takes one.\n\n1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:08.120\n That ball only has to go into the net once and we're doomed, which is not the case with\n\n1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:09.120\n mass shooters.\n\n1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:12.280\n It's not the case with commercial pilots run amok.\n\n1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:17.560\n It's not the case with really any threat that I can think of with the exception of nuclear\n\n1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:24.720\n war that has the one bad outcome and game over.\n\n1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:31.040\n And that means that we need to be unbelievably serious about these defenses and we need to\n\n1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:36.680\n do things that might on the surface seem like a tremendous overreaction so that we can be\n\n1:14:36.680 --> 1:14:39.640\n prepared to nip anything that comes along in the bud.\n\n1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:43.560\n I like you believe that's eminently doable.\n\n1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:47.880\n I like you believe that the good guys outnumber the bad guys in this particular one to a degree\n\n1:14:47.880 --> 1:14:49.760\n that probably has no precedent in history.\n\n1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:55.960\n I mean, even the worst, worst people I'm sure in ISIS, even Osama bin Laden, even any bad\n\n1:14:55.960 --> 1:15:01.840\n guy you could imagine in history would be revolted by the idea of exterminating all\n\n1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:02.840\n of humanity.\n\n1:15:02.840 --> 1:15:06.160\n I mean, that's a low bar.\n\n1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.140\n And so the good guys completely outnumber the bad guys when it comes to this.\n\n1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:18.560\n But the asymmetry and the fact that one catastrophic error could lead to unbelievably consequential\n\n1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:20.000\n things is what worries me here.\n\n1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.880\n But I too am very optimistic.\n\n1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:27.240\n The thing that I sometimes worry about is the fact that we haven't seen overwhelming\n\n1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:33.840\n evidence of alien civilizations out there makes me think, well, there's a lot of explanations,\n\n1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:40.120\n but one of them that worries me is that whenever they get smart, they just destroy themselves.\n\n1:15:40.120 --> 1:15:41.120\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:15:41.120 --> 1:15:46.880\n I mean, that was the most fascinating, is the most fascinating and chilling number or\n\n1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:53.080\n variable in the Drake equation is L. At the end of it, you look out and you see, you know,\n\n1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:56.360\n one to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n1:15:56.360 --> 1:16:01.180\n And we now know because of Kepler that an astonishingly high percentage of them probably\n\n1:16:01.180 --> 1:16:03.540\n have habitable planets.\n\n1:16:03.540 --> 1:16:07.480\n And you know, so all the things that were unknowns when the Drake equation was originally\n\n1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:10.620\n written, like, you know, how many stars have planets?\n\n1:16:10.620 --> 1:16:15.080\n Actually back then in the 1960s when the Drake equation came along, the consensus amongst\n\n1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:19.520\n astronomers was that it would be a small minority of solar systems that had planets or stars.\n\n1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:22.040\n But now we know it's substantially all of them.\n\n1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:25.960\n How many of those stars have planets in the habitable zone?\n\n1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:29.480\n It's kind of looking like 20%, like, oh my God.\n\n1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:36.440\n And so L, which is how long does a civilization, once it reaches technological competence,\n\n1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:37.960\n continues to last?\n\n1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.260\n That's the doozy.\n\n1:16:40.260 --> 1:16:42.100\n And you're right.\n\n1:16:42.100 --> 1:16:47.720\n It's all too plausible to think that when a civilization reaches a level of sophistication,\n\n1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:50.600\n that's probably just a decade or three in our future.\n\n1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:57.440\n The odds of it self destructing just start mounting astronomically, no pun intended.\n\n1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:02.160\n My hope is that actually there is a lot of alien civilizations out there and what they\n\n1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:09.560\n figure out in order to avoid the self destruction, they need to turn off the thing that was useful,\n\n1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:13.960\n that used to be a feature, now became a bug, which is the desire to colonize, to conquer\n\n1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:14.960\n more land.\n\n1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:19.160\n So they, like, there's probably ultra intelligent alien civilizations out there, they're just\n\n1:17:19.160 --> 1:17:25.040\n like chilling, like on the beach with whatever your favorite alcohol beverage is, but like\n\n1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:28.040\n without sort of trying to conquer everything.\n\n1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:36.960\n Just chilling out and maybe exploring in the realm of knowledge, but almost like appreciating\n\n1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:47.800\n existence for its own sake versus life as a progression of conquering of other life.\n\n1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:54.880\n Like this kind of predator prey formulation that resulted in us humans, perhaps as something\n\n1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:57.280\n we have to shed in order to survive.\n\n1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:58.280\n I don't know.\n\n1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:04.640\n Yeah, that is a very plausible solution to Fermi's paradox and it's one that makes sense.\n\n1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:11.760\n You know, when we look at our own lives and our own arc of technological trajectory, it's\n\n1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:18.800\n very, very easy to imagine that in an intermediate future world of, you know, flawless VR or\n\n1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:25.200\n flawless, you know, whatever kind of simulation that we want to inhabit, it will just simply\n\n1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:34.080\n cease to be worthwhile to go out and expand our interstellar territory.\n\n1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:38.320\n But if we were going out and conquering interstellar territory, it wouldn't necessarily have to\n\n1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:39.320\n be predator or prey.\n\n1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:44.600\n I can imagine a benign but sophisticated intelligence saying, well, we're going to go to places,\n\n1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:48.400\n we're going to go to places that we can terraform, use a different word than terra, obviously,\n\n1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:55.280\n but we can turn into habitable for our particular physiology so long as that they don't house,\n\n1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:59.760\n you know, intelligent sentient creatures that would suffer from our invasion.\n\n1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:05.440\n But it is easy to see a sophisticated intelligent species evolving to the point where interstellar\n\n1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:11.360\n travel with its incalculable expense and physical hurdles just isn't worth it compared to what\n\n1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:15.040\n could be done, you know, where one already is.\n\n1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:22.640\n So you talked about diagnostics at scale as a possible solution to future pandemics.\n\n1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:27.040\n What about another possible solution, which is kind of creating a backup copy?\n\n1:19:27.040 --> 1:19:32.400\n You know, I'm actually now putting together a NAS for a backup for myself for the first\n\n1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:35.140\n time taking backup of data seriously.\n\n1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:39.960\n But if we were to take the backup of human consciousness seriously and try to expand\n\n1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:44.400\n throughout the solar system and colonize other planets, do you think that's an interesting\n\n1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:47.160\n solution?\n\n1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:53.300\n One of many for protecting human civilization from self destruction, sort of humans becoming\n\n1:19:53.300 --> 1:19:54.840\n a multi planetary species?\n\n1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:55.840\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n1:19:55.840 --> 1:19:59.320\n I mean, I find it electrifying, first of all, so I've got a little bit of a personal bias\n\n1:19:59.320 --> 1:20:03.040\n when I was a kid, I thought there was nothing cooler than rockets, I thought there was nothing\n\n1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:08.400\n cooler than NASA, I thought there was nothing cooler than people walking on the moon.\n\n1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:12.380\n And as I grew up, I thought there was nothing more tragic than the fact that we went from\n\n1:20:12.380 --> 1:20:17.720\n walking on the moon to at best getting to something like suborbital altitude.\n\n1:20:17.720 --> 1:20:23.800\n And just I found that more and more depressing with the passage of decades at just the colossal\n\n1:20:23.800 --> 1:20:29.600\n expense of, you know, manned space travel and the fact that it seemed that we were unlikely\n\n1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:31.880\n to ever get back to the moon, let alone Mars.\n\n1:20:31.880 --> 1:20:36.460\n So I have a boundless appreciation for Elon Musk for many reasons.\n\n1:20:36.460 --> 1:20:41.840\n But the fact that he has put Mars on the credible agenda is one of the things that I appreciate\n\n1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:43.120\n immensely.\n\n1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:47.440\n So there's just the sort of space nerd in me that just says, God, that's cool.\n\n1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:54.780\n But on a more practical level, we were talking about, you know, potentially inhabiting planets\n\n1:20:54.780 --> 1:20:56.800\n that aren't our own.\n\n1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:04.280\n And we're thinking about a benign civilization that would do that in planetary circumstances,\n\n1:21:04.280 --> 1:21:07.240\n where we're not causing other conscious systems to suffer.\n\n1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:11.800\n I mean, Mars is a place that's very promising, there may be microbial life there, and I hope\n\n1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:12.800\n there is.\n\n1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:15.040\n And if we found it, I think it would be electrifying.\n\n1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:20.120\n But I think ultimately, the moral judgment would be made that, you know, the continued\n\n1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:26.760\n thriving of that microbial life is of less concern than creating a habitable planet to\n\n1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:30.680\n humans, which would be a project on the many thousands of years scale.\n\n1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:34.440\n But I don't think that that would be a greatly immoral act.\n\n1:21:34.440 --> 1:21:39.080\n And if that happened, and if Mars became, you know, home to a self sustaining group\n\n1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:44.040\n of humans that could survive a catastrophic mistake here on Earth, then yeah, the fact\n\n1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:46.100\n that we have a backup colony is great.\n\n1:21:46.100 --> 1:21:50.260\n And if we could make more, I'm sorry, not backup colony, backup copy is great.\n\n1:21:50.260 --> 1:21:55.380\n And if we could make more and more such backup copies throughout the solar system, by hollowing\n\n1:21:55.380 --> 1:21:59.880\n out asteroids and whatever else it is, maybe even Venus, we could get rid of three quarters\n\n1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:04.560\n of its atmosphere and, you know, turn it into a tropical paradise.\n\n1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:05.760\n I think all of that is wonderful.\n\n1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:11.580\n Now, whether we can make the leap from that to interstellar transportation, with the incredible\n\n1:22:11.580 --> 1:22:15.980\n distances that are involved, I think that's an open question.\n\n1:22:15.980 --> 1:22:25.440\n But I think if we ever do that, it would be more like the Pacific Ocean's channel of human\n\n1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:28.040\n expansion than the Atlantic Ocean's.\n\n1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:34.560\n And so what I mean by that is, when we think about European society transmitting itself\n\n1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:42.480\n across the Atlantic, it's these big, ambitious, crazy, expensive, one shot expeditions like\n\n1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:47.840\n Columbus's to make it across this enormous expanse, and at least initially, without any\n\n1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:50.280\n certainty that there's land on the other end, right?\n\n1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:56.880\n So that's kind of how I view our space program, is like big, very conscious, deliberate efforts\n\n1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:58.560\n to get from point A to point B.\n\n1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:06.240\n If you look at how Pacific Islanders transmitted, you know, their descendants and their culture\n\n1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:14.120\n and so forth throughout Polynesia and beyond, it was much more, you know, inhabiting a place,\n\n1:23:14.120 --> 1:23:18.520\n getting to the point where there were people who were ambitious or unwelcome enough to\n\n1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:23.220\n decide it's time to go off island and find the next one and pray to find the next one.\n\n1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:28.840\n That method of transmission didn't happen in a single swift year, but it happened over\n\n1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:30.960\n many, many centuries.\n\n1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:34.580\n And it was like going from this island to that island, and probably for every expedition\n\n1:23:34.580 --> 1:23:38.480\n that went out to seek another island and actually lucked out and found one, God knows how many\n\n1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:40.000\n were lost at sea.\n\n1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.460\n But that form of transmission took place over a very long period of time.\n\n1:23:43.460 --> 1:23:48.160\n And I could see us, you know, perhaps, you know, going from the inner solar system to\n\n1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:53.040\n the outer solar system, to the Kuiper Belt, to the Oort Cloud, you know, there's theories\n\n1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:57.320\n that there might be, you know, planets out there that are not anchored to stars, like\n\n1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:02.240\n kind of hop, hop, slowly transmitting ourselves to at some point, we're actually in an Alpha\n\n1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:03.640\n Centauri.\n\n1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:09.920\n But I think that kind of backup copy and transmission of our physical presence and our culture to\n\n1:24:09.920 --> 1:24:15.600\n a diversity of, you know, extraterrestrial outposts is a really exciting idea.\n\n1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:21.720\n I really never thought about that, because I have thought my thinking about space exploration\n\n1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:26.200\n has been very Atlantic Ocean centric in a sense that there'll be one program with NASA\n\n1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:31.800\n and maybe private Elon Musk SpaceX or Jeff Bezos and so on.\n\n1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:36.880\n But it's true that with the help of Elon Musk, making it cheaper and cheaper, more effective\n\n1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:42.800\n to create these technologies, where you could go into deep space, perhaps the way we actually\n\n1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:52.680\n colonize the solar system and expand out into the galaxy is basically just like these like\n\n1:24:52.680 --> 1:25:02.360\n renegade ships of weirdos that just kind of like, most of them like, quote unquote, homemade,\n\n1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:07.800\n but they just kind of venture out into space and just like, you know, the initial Android\n\n1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:12.600\n model of like millions of like these little ships just flying out, most of them die off\n\n1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:19.800\n in horrible accidents, but some of them will persist or there'll be stories of them persisting\n\n1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:24.200\n and over a period of decades and centuries, there'll be other attempts, almost always\n\n1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:27.320\n as a response to the main set of efforts.\n\n1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:28.320\n That's interesting.\n\n1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:29.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:34.880\n Because you kind of think of Mars colonization as the big NASA Elon Musk effort of a big\n\n1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:39.560\n colony, but maybe the successful one would be, you know, like a decade after that, there'll\n\n1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:45.040\n be like a ship from like some kid, some high school kid who gets together a large team\n\n1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:50.560\n and does something probably illegal and launches something where they end up actually persisting\n\n1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:51.600\n quite a bit.\n\n1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:56.600\n And from that learning lessons that nobody ever gave permission for, but somehow actually\n\n1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:04.680\n flourish and then take that into the scale of centuries forward into the rest of space.\n\n1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:05.680\n That's really interesting.\n\n1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:06.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:11.080\n I think the giant steps are likely to be NASA like efforts, like there is no intermediate\n\n1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:14.480\n rock, well, I guess it's the moon, but even getting the moon ain't that easy between us\n\n1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:15.480\n and Mars, right?\n\n1:26:15.480 --> 1:26:20.980\n So like the giant steps, the big hubs, like the Ohera airports of the future probably\n\n1:26:20.980 --> 1:26:25.960\n will be very deliberate efforts, but then, you know, you would have, I think that kind\n\n1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:31.520\n of diffusion as space travel becomes more democratized and more capable, you'll have\n\n1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:35.720\n this sort of natural diffusion of people who kind of want to be off grid or think they\n\n1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:37.000\n can make a fortune there.\n\n1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.320\n You know, the kind of mentality that drove people to San Francisco, I mean, San Francisco\n\n1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:46.240\n was not populated as a result of King Ferdinand and Isabella like effort to fund Columbus\n\n1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:47.240\n going over.\n\n1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.120\n It was just a whole bunch of people making individual decisions that there's gold in\n\n1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:53.400\n them Thar Hills and I'm going to go out and get a piece of it.\n\n1:26:53.400 --> 1:26:55.040\n So I could see that kind of fusion.\n\n1:26:55.040 --> 1:26:59.320\n What I can't see and the reason that I think this Pacific model of transmission is more\n\n1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:06.440\n likely is I just can't see a NASA like effort to go from Earth to Alpha Centauri.\n\n1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:08.640\n It's just too far.\n\n1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:15.160\n I just see lots and lots and lots of relatively tiny steps between now and there and the fact\n\n1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:20.440\n is that there is, there are large chunks of matter going at least a light year beyond\n\n1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:21.440\n the sun.\n\n1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:25.960\n I mean, the Oort cloud, I think extends at least a light year beyond the sun and you\n\n1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:28.240\n know, then maybe there are these untethered planets after that.\n\n1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:32.520\n We won't really know till we get there and if our Oort cloud goes out a light year and\n\n1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:37.700\n Alpha Centauri's Oort cloud goes out a light year, you've already cut in half the distance.\n\n1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:38.960\n You know, so who knows?\n\n1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:39.960\n But yeah.\n\n1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:46.200\n One of the possibilities, probably the cheapest and most effective way to create interesting\n\n1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:53.200\n interstellar spacecraft is ones that are powered and driven by AI and you could think of, here's\n\n1:27:53.200 --> 1:28:00.560\n where you have high school students be able to build a sort of a HAL 9000 version, the\n\n1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:07.200\n modern version of that and it's kind of interesting to think about these robots traveling out\n\n1:28:07.200 --> 1:28:15.760\n throughout, perhaps sadly long after human civilization is gone, there'll be these intelligent\n\n1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:22.920\n robots flying throughout space and perhaps land on Alpha Centauri B or any of those kinds\n\n1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:34.360\n of planets and colonize sort of, humanity continues through the proliferation of our\n\n1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:42.080\n creations like robotic creations that have some echoes of that intelligence, hopefully\n\n1:28:42.080 --> 1:28:43.080\n also the consciousness.\n\n1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:50.640\n Does that make you sad the future where AGI super intelligent or just mediocre intelligent\n\n1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:54.400\n AI systems outlive humans?\n\n1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:58.480\n I guess it depends on the circumstances in which they outlive humans.\n\n1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:01.360\n So let's take the example that you just gave.\n\n1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:08.400\n We send out very sophisticated AGI's on simple rocket ships, relatively simple ones that\n\n1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:13.440\n don't have to have all the life support necessary for humans and therefore they're of trivial\n\n1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:18.980\n mass compared to a crude ship, a generation ship and therefore they're way more likely\n\n1:29:18.980 --> 1:29:19.980\n to happen.\n\n1:29:19.980 --> 1:29:21.360\n Let's use that example.\n\n1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:26.200\n And let's say that they travel to distant planets at a speed that's not much faster\n\n1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:30.240\n than what a chemical rocket can achieve and so it's inevitably tens, hundreds of thousands\n\n1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:32.680\n of years before they make landfall someplace.\n\n1:29:32.680 --> 1:29:39.200\n So let's imagine that's going on and meanwhile we die for reasons that have nothing to do\n\n1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:43.600\n with those AGI's diffusing throughout the solar system, whether it's through climate\n\n1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:47.360\n change, nuclear war, you know, symbio, rogue symbio, whatever.\n\n1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:51.780\n In that kind of scenario, the notion of the AGI's that we created outlasting us is very\n\n1:29:51.780 --> 1:29:59.640\n reassuring because it says that like we ended but our descendants are out there and hopefully\n\n1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:02.840\n some of them make landfall and create some echo of who we are.\n\n1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:04.960\n So that's a very optimistic one.\n\n1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:11.540\n Whereas the Terminator scenario of a super AGI arising on earth and getting let out of\n\n1:30:11.540 --> 1:30:17.920\n its box due to some boo boo on the part of its creators who do not have super intelligence\n\n1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:22.460\n and then deciding that for whatever reason it doesn't have any need for us to be around\n\n1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:26.120\n and exterminating us, that makes me feel crushingly sad.\n\n1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:31.740\n I mean, look, I was sad when my elementary school was shut down and bulldozed even though\n\n1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:37.140\n I hadn't been a student there for decades, you know, the thought of my hometown getting\n\n1:30:37.140 --> 1:30:42.200\n disbanded is even worse, the thought of my home state of Connecticut getting disbanded\n\n1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:44.960\n and like absorbed into Massachusetts is even worse.\n\n1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:48.600\n The notion of humanity is just crushingly, crushingly sad to me.\n\n1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:51.420\n So you hate goodbyes.\n\n1:30:51.420 --> 1:30:53.020\n Certain goodbyes, yes.\n\n1:30:53.020 --> 1:30:56.160\n Some goodbyes are really, really liberating, but yes.\n\n1:30:56.160 --> 1:31:03.580\n Well, but what if the Terminators, you know, have consciousness and enjoy the hell out\n\n1:31:03.580 --> 1:31:05.660\n of life as well?\n\n1:31:05.660 --> 1:31:07.260\n They're just better at it.\n\n1:31:07.260 --> 1:31:08.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:08.260 --> 1:31:11.260\n Well, the have consciousness is a really key element.\n\n1:31:11.260 --> 1:31:19.660\n And so there's no reason to be certain that a super intelligence would have consciousness.\n\n1:31:19.660 --> 1:31:21.160\n We don't know that factually at all.\n\n1:31:21.160 --> 1:31:26.180\n And so what is a very lonely outcome to me is the rise of a super intelligence that has\n\n1:31:26.180 --> 1:31:31.540\n a certain optimization function that it's either been programmed with or that arises\n\n1:31:31.540 --> 1:31:36.980\n in an emergently that says, Hey, I want to do this thing for which humans are either\n\n1:31:36.980 --> 1:31:38.260\n an unacceptable risk.\n\n1:31:38.260 --> 1:31:42.500\n Their presence is either an unacceptable risk or they're just collateral damage, but there\n\n1:31:42.500 --> 1:31:44.580\n is no consciousness there.\n\n1:31:44.580 --> 1:31:49.740\n Then the idea of the light of consciousness being snuffed out by something that is very\n\n1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:54.020\n competent but has no consciousness is really, really sad.\n\n1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:58.700\n Yeah, but I tend to believe that it's almost impossible to create a super intelligent agent\n\n1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:01.820\n that can't destroy human civilization without it being conscious.\n\n1:32:01.820 --> 1:32:08.700\n It's like those are coupled, like you have to, in order to destroy humans or supersede\n\n1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:13.580\n humans, you really have to be accepted by humans.\n\n1:32:13.580 --> 1:32:20.540\n I think this idea that you can build systems that destroy human civilization without them\n\n1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:23.420\n being deeply integrated into human civilization is impossible.\n\n1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:29.220\n And for them to be integrated, they have to be human like, not just in body and form,\n\n1:32:29.220 --> 1:32:34.660\n but in all the things that we value as humans, one of which is consciousness.\n\n1:32:34.660 --> 1:32:36.920\n The other one is just ability to communicate.\n\n1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:40.340\n The other one is poetry and music and beauty and all those things.\n\n1:32:40.340 --> 1:32:43.140\n They have to be all of those things.\n\n1:32:43.140 --> 1:32:45.340\n I mean, this is what I think about.\n\n1:32:45.340 --> 1:32:53.220\n It does make me sad, but it's letting go, which is they might be just better at everything\n\n1:32:53.220 --> 1:32:55.260\n we appreciate than us.\n\n1:32:55.260 --> 1:33:05.300\n And that's sad and hopefully they'll keep us around, but I think it is a kind of goodbye\n\n1:33:05.300 --> 1:33:10.900\n to realizing that we're not the most special species on earth anymore.\n\n1:33:10.900 --> 1:33:12.020\n That's still painful.\n\n1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:13.020\n It's still painful.\n\n1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:19.580\n And in terms of whether such a creation would have to be conscious, let's say, I'm not so\n\n1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:20.580\n sure.\n\n1:33:20.580 --> 1:33:25.500\n But let's imagine something that can pass the Turing test.\n\n1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:31.180\n Something that passes the Turing test could over text based interaction in any event successfully\n\n1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:37.280\n mimic a very conscious intelligence on the other end, but just be completely unconscious.\n\n1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:39.020\n So that's a possibility.\n\n1:33:39.020 --> 1:33:43.360\n And that if you take that upper radical step, which I think can be permitted if we're thinking\n\n1:33:43.360 --> 1:33:49.740\n about super intelligence, you could have something that could reason its way through, this is\n\n1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:51.540\n my optimization function.\n\n1:33:51.540 --> 1:33:56.060\n And in order to get to it, I've got to deal with these messy, somewhat illogical things\n\n1:33:56.060 --> 1:34:01.420\n that are as intelligent in relation to me as they are intelligent in relation to ants.\n\n1:34:01.420 --> 1:34:04.000\n I can trick them, manipulate them, whatever.\n\n1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.260\n And I know the resources I need.\n\n1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:07.220\n I know this, I need this amount of power.\n\n1:34:07.220 --> 1:34:13.260\n I need to seize control of these manufacturing resources that are robotically operated.\n\n1:34:13.260 --> 1:34:17.860\n I need to improve those robots with software upgrades and then ultimately mechanical upgrades,\n\n1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:23.420\n which I can affect through X, Y, and Z, that could still be a thing that passes the Turing\n\n1:34:23.420 --> 1:34:24.420\n test.\n\n1:34:24.420 --> 1:34:33.460\n I don't think it's necessarily certain that that optimization function mass, maximizing\n\n1:34:33.460 --> 1:34:36.260\n entity would be conscious.\n\n1:34:36.260 --> 1:34:42.640\n So this is from a very engineering perspective because I think a lot about natural language\n\n1:34:42.640 --> 1:34:47.900\n processing, all those kind of, I'm speaking to a very specific problem of just say the\n\n1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:48.900\n Turing test.\n\n1:34:48.900 --> 1:34:55.060\n I really think that something like consciousness is required, when you say reasoning, you're\n\n1:34:55.060 --> 1:34:56.700\n separating that from consciousness.\n\n1:34:56.700 --> 1:35:03.280\n But I think consciousness is part of reasoning in the sense that you will not be able to\n\n1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:10.140\n become super intelligent in the way that it's required to be part of human society without\n\n1:35:10.140 --> 1:35:11.140\n having consciousness.\n\n1:35:11.140 --> 1:35:15.900\n Like I really think it's impossible to separate the consciousness thing, but it's hard to\n\n1:35:15.900 --> 1:35:18.740\n define consciousness when you just use that word.\n\n1:35:18.740 --> 1:35:25.520\n Even just like the capacity, the way I think about consciousness is the important symptoms\n\n1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:31.420\n or maybe consequences of consciousness, one of which is the capacity to suffer.\n\n1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:37.700\n I think AI will need to be able to suffer in order to become super intelligent, to feel\n\n1:35:37.700 --> 1:35:40.540\n the pain, the uncertainty, the doubt.\n\n1:35:40.540 --> 1:35:48.460\n The other part of that is not just the suffering, but the ability to understand that it too\n\n1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:54.340\n is mortal in the sense that it has a self awareness about its presence in the world,\n\n1:35:54.340 --> 1:35:58.620\n understand that it's finite and be terrified of that finiteness.\n\n1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:02.860\n I personally think that's a fundamental part of the human condition is this fear of death\n\n1:36:02.860 --> 1:36:08.400\n that most of us construct an illusion around, but I think AI would need to be able to really\n\n1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:12.060\n have it part of its whole essence.\n\n1:36:12.060 --> 1:36:17.780\n Like every computation, every part of the thing that generates, that does both the perception\n\n1:36:17.780 --> 1:36:23.640\n and generates the behavior will have to have, I don't know how this is accomplished, but\n\n1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:30.480\n I believe it has to truly be terrified of death, truly have the capacity to suffer and\n\n1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:35.380\n from that something that will be recognized to us humans as consciousness would emerge.\n\n1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:37.740\n Whether it's the illusion of consciousness, I don't know.\n\n1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:42.020\n The point is, it looks a whole hell of a lot like consciousness to us humans.\n\n1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:49.940\n And I believe that AI, when you ask it, will also say that it is conscious, in the full\n\n1:36:49.940 --> 1:36:52.340\n sense that we say that we're conscious.\n\n1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:54.560\n And all of that I think is fully integrated.\n\n1:36:54.560 --> 1:37:02.700\n You can't separate the two, the idea of the paperclip maximizer that sort of ultra rationally\n\n1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:10.740\n would be able to destroy all humans because it's really good at accomplishing a simple\n\n1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:14.220\n objective function that doesn't care about the value of humans.\n\n1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:20.020\n It may be possible, but the number of trajectories to that are far outnumbered by the trajectories\n\n1:37:20.020 --> 1:37:25.060\n that create something that is conscious, something that appreciative of beauty creates beautiful\n\n1:37:25.060 --> 1:37:27.940\n things in the same way that humans can create beautiful things.\n\n1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:36.380\n And ultimately, the sad, destructive path for that AI would look a lot like just better\n\n1:37:36.380 --> 1:37:41.740\n humans than these cold machines.\n\n1:37:41.740 --> 1:37:47.340\n And I would say, of course, the cold machines that lack consciousness, the philosophical\n\n1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:49.740\n zombies make me sad.\n\n1:37:49.740 --> 1:37:56.260\n But also what makes me sad is just things that are far more powerful and smart and creative\n\n1:37:56.260 --> 1:38:04.420\n than us too, because then in the same way that Alpha Zero becoming a better chess player\n\n1:38:04.420 --> 1:38:10.940\n than the best of humans, even starting with Deep Blue, but really with Alpha Zero, that\n\n1:38:10.940 --> 1:38:11.940\n makes me sad too.\n\n1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:19.620\n One of the most beautiful games that humans ever created that used to be seen as demonstrations\n\n1:38:19.620 --> 1:38:25.060\n of the intellect, which is chess, and go in other parts of the world have been solved\n\n1:38:25.060 --> 1:38:29.700\n by AI, that makes me quite sad, and it feels like the progress of that is just pushing\n\n1:38:29.700 --> 1:38:30.700\n on forward.\n\n1:38:30.700 --> 1:38:31.700\n Oh, it makes me sad too.\n\n1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:37.700\n And to be perfectly clear, I absolutely believe that artificial consciousness is entirely\n\n1:38:37.700 --> 1:38:38.700\n possible.\n\n1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:40.620\n And that's not something I rule out at all.\n\n1:38:40.620 --> 1:38:46.820\n I mean, if you could get smart enough to have a perfect map of the neural structure and\n\n1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:51.500\n the neural states and the amount of neurotransmitters that are going between every synapse in a\n\n1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:59.020\n particular person's mind, could you replicate that in silica at some reasonably distant\n\n1:38:59.020 --> 1:39:00.020\n point in the future?\n\n1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:01.020\n Absolutely.\n\n1:39:01.020 --> 1:39:02.020\n And then you'd have a consciousness.\n\n1:39:02.020 --> 1:39:05.820\n I don't rule out the possibility of artificial consciousness in any way.\n\n1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:11.900\n What I'm less certain about is whether consciousness is a requirement for superintelligence pursuing\n\n1:39:11.900 --> 1:39:16.140\n a maximizing function of some sort.\n\n1:39:16.140 --> 1:39:21.940\n I don't feel the certitude that consciousness simply must be part of that.\n\n1:39:21.940 --> 1:39:27.020\n You had said for it to coexist with human society would need to be consciousness.\n\n1:39:27.020 --> 1:39:32.920\n Could be entirely true, but it also could just exist orthogonally to human society.\n\n1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:39.540\n And it could also upon attaining a superintelligence with a maximizing function very, very, very\n\n1:39:39.540 --> 1:39:46.100\n rapidly because of the speed at which computing works compared to our own meat based minds\n\n1:39:46.100 --> 1:39:51.420\n very, very rapidly make the decisions and calculations necessary to seize the reins\n\n1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:53.140\n of power before we even know what's going on.\n\n1:39:53.140 --> 1:39:54.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:54.140 --> 1:39:58.300\n I mean, kind of like biological viruses do, they don't necessarily, they integrate themselves\n\n1:39:58.300 --> 1:39:59.940\n just fine with human society.\n\n1:39:59.940 --> 1:40:00.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:05.380\n Without technically, without consciousness, without even being alive, you know, technically\n\n1:40:05.380 --> 1:40:07.960\n by the standards of a lot of biologists.\n\n1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:14.700\n So this is a bit of a tangent, but you've talked with Sam Harris on that four hour special\n\n1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:16.500\n episode we mentioned.\n\n1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:22.500\n And I'm just curious to ask, cause I use this meditation app I've been using for the past\n\n1:40:22.500 --> 1:40:24.020\n month to meditate.\n\n1:40:24.020 --> 1:40:29.340\n Is this something you've integrated as part of your life, meditation or fasting, or has\n\n1:40:29.340 --> 1:40:35.340\n some of Sam Harris rubbed off on you in terms of his appreciation of meditation and just\n\n1:40:35.340 --> 1:40:40.580\n kind of from a third person perspective, analyzing your own mind, consciousness, free will and\n\n1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:41.580\n so on?\n\n1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:46.700\n You know, I've tried it three separate times in my life, really made a concerted attack\n\n1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:51.020\n on meditation and integrating it into my life.\n\n1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:55.980\n One of them, the most extreme was I took a class based on the work of Jon Kabat Zinn,\n\n1:40:55.980 --> 1:41:01.900\n who is, you know, in many ways, one of the founding people behind the mindful meditation\n\n1:41:01.900 --> 1:41:08.780\n movement that required like part of the class was, you know, it was a weekly class and you\n\n1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:12.740\n were going to meditate an hour a day, every day.\n\n1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:16.940\n And having done that for, I think it was 10 weeks, it might've been 13, however long period\n\n1:41:16.940 --> 1:41:20.060\n of time was, at the end of it, it just didn't stick.\n\n1:41:20.060 --> 1:41:24.940\n As soon as it was over, you know, I did not feel that gravitational pull.\n\n1:41:24.940 --> 1:41:33.020\n I did not feel the collapse in quality of life after wimping out on that project.\n\n1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:37.780\n And then the most recent one was actually with Sam's app during the lockdown.\n\n1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:43.820\n I did make a pretty good and consistent concerted effort to listen to his 10 minute meditation\n\n1:41:43.820 --> 1:41:44.820\n every day.\n\n1:41:44.820 --> 1:41:46.780\n And I've always fallen away from it.\n\n1:41:46.780 --> 1:41:50.860\n And I, you know, you're kind of interpreting, why did I personally do this?\n\n1:41:50.860 --> 1:41:56.340\n I do believe it was ultimately because it wasn't bringing me that, you know, joy or\n\n1:41:56.340 --> 1:42:01.420\n inner peace or better competence at being me that I was hoping to get from it.\n\n1:42:01.420 --> 1:42:06.380\n Otherwise, I think I would have clung to it in the way that we cling to certain good habits,\n\n1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:08.340\n like I'm really good at flossing my teeth.\n\n1:42:08.340 --> 1:42:12.460\n Not that you were going to ask Lex, but yeah, that's one thing that defeats a lot of people.\n\n1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:13.460\n I'm good at that.\n\n1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:20.540\n See, Herman Hesse, I think, I forget which book or maybe, I forget where, I've read everything\n\n1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:30.260\n of his, so it's unclear where it came from, but he had this idea that anybody who truly\n\n1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:35.580\n achieves mastery in things will learn how to meditate in some way.\n\n1:42:35.580 --> 1:42:41.360\n So it could be that for you, the flossing of teeth is yet another like little inkling\n\n1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:42.360\n of meditation.\n\n1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:46.060\n Like it doesn't have to be this very particular kind of meditation.\n\n1:42:46.060 --> 1:42:49.220\n Maybe podcasting, you have an amazing podcast, that could be meditation.\n\n1:42:49.220 --> 1:42:51.320\n The writing process is meditation.\n\n1:42:51.320 --> 1:43:01.460\n For me, like there's a bunch of mechanisms which take my mind into a very particular\n\n1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:04.580\n place that looks a whole lot like meditation.\n\n1:43:04.580 --> 1:43:12.340\n For example, when I've been running over the past couple years, and especially when I listen\n\n1:43:12.340 --> 1:43:17.180\n to certain kinds of audio books, like I've listened to the Rise and Fall of the Third\n\n1:43:17.180 --> 1:43:18.180\n Reich.\n\n1:43:18.180 --> 1:43:24.980\n I've listened to a lot of sort of World War II, which at once, because I have a lot of\n\n1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:30.020\n family who's lost in World War II and so much of the Soviet Union is grounded in the suffering\n\n1:43:30.020 --> 1:43:36.420\n of World War II, that somehow it connects me to my history, but also there's some kind\n\n1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:42.420\n of purifying aspect to thinking about how cruel, but at the same time, how beautiful\n\n1:43:42.420 --> 1:43:43.940\n human nature could be.\n\n1:43:43.940 --> 1:43:49.540\n And so you're also running, like it clears the mind from all the concerns of the world\n\n1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:54.760\n and somehow it takes you to this place where you were like deeply appreciative to be alive\n\n1:43:54.760 --> 1:43:59.060\n in the sense that as opposed to listening to your breath or like feeling your breath\n\n1:43:59.060 --> 1:44:04.100\n and thinking about your consciousness and all those kinds of processes that Sam's app\n\n1:44:04.100 --> 1:44:05.100\n does.\n\n1:44:05.100 --> 1:44:10.660\n Well, this does that for me, the running and flossing may do that for you.\n\n1:44:10.660 --> 1:44:12.660\n So maybe Herman Hesse is onto something.\n\n1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:16.980\n So I hope flossing is not my main form of expertise, although I am going to claim a\n\n1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:19.220\n certain expertise there and I'm going to claim it.\n\n1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:21.380\n Somebody has to be the best flosser in the world.\n\n1:44:21.380 --> 1:44:22.380\n That ain't me.\n\n1:44:22.380 --> 1:44:23.780\n I'm just glad that I'm a consistent one.\n\n1:44:23.780 --> 1:44:27.000\n I mean, there are a lot of things that bring me into a flow state and I think maybe perhaps\n\n1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:31.460\n that's one reason why meditation isn't as necessary for me.\n\n1:44:31.460 --> 1:44:34.140\n I definitely enter a flow state when I'm writing and definitely enter a flow state\n\n1:44:34.140 --> 1:44:35.140\n when I'm editing.\n\n1:44:35.140 --> 1:44:39.420\n I definitely enter a flow state when I'm mixing and mastering music.\n\n1:44:39.420 --> 1:44:44.880\n I enter a flow state when I'm doing heavy, heavy research to either prepare for a podcast\n\n1:44:44.880 --> 1:44:52.460\n or to also do tech investing, to make myself smart in a new field that is fairly alien\n\n1:44:52.460 --> 1:44:58.520\n to me, I can just, the hours can just melt away while I'm reading this and watching that\n\n1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:02.540\n YouTube lecture and going through this presentation and so forth.\n\n1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:06.880\n So maybe because there's a lot of things that bring me into a flow state in my normal weekly\n\n1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:11.020\n life, not daily, unfortunately, but certainly my normal weekly life that I have less of\n\n1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:12.260\n an urge to meditate.\n\n1:45:12.260 --> 1:45:15.900\n Now you've been working with Sam's app for about a month now, you said.\n\n1:45:15.900 --> 1:45:17.420\n Is this your first run in with meditation?\n\n1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:19.740\n Is your first attempt to integrate it with your life or?\n\n1:45:19.740 --> 1:45:20.740\n Like meditation, meditation.\n\n1:45:20.740 --> 1:45:26.220\n I always thought running and thinking, I listen to brown noise often.\n\n1:45:26.220 --> 1:45:29.820\n That takes my mind, I don't know what the hell it does, but it takes my mind immediately\n\n1:45:29.820 --> 1:45:33.140\n into like the state where I'm deeply focused on anything I do.\n\n1:45:33.140 --> 1:45:34.220\n I don't know why.\n\n1:45:34.220 --> 1:45:37.260\n So it's like you're accompanying sound when you're like, really?\n\n1:45:37.260 --> 1:45:39.300\n And what's the difference between brown and white noise?\n\n1:45:39.300 --> 1:45:41.460\n This is a cool term I haven't heard before.\n\n1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:43.340\n So people should look up brown noise.\n\n1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:45.980\n They don't have to because you're about to tell them what it is.\n\n1:45:45.980 --> 1:45:48.220\n Because you have to experience, you have to listen to it.\n\n1:45:48.220 --> 1:45:52.020\n So I think white noise is, this has to do with music.\n\n1:45:52.020 --> 1:45:55.140\n I think there's different colors, there's pink noise.\n\n1:45:55.140 --> 1:45:59.740\n And I think that has to do with like the frequencies.\n\n1:45:59.740 --> 1:46:06.060\n Like the white noise is usually less bassy, brown noise is very bassy.\n\n1:46:06.060 --> 1:46:14.180\n So it's more like versus like, if that makes sense.\n\n1:46:14.180 --> 1:46:16.340\n So there's like a deepness to it.\n\n1:46:16.340 --> 1:46:25.260\n I think everyone is different, but for me, when I was a research scientist at MIT,\n\n1:46:25.260 --> 1:46:29.740\n especially when there's a lot of students around, I remember just being annoyed\n\n1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:31.500\n at the noise of people talking.\n\n1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:34.940\n And one of my colleagues said, well, you should try listening to brown noise.\n\n1:46:34.940 --> 1:46:36.780\n Like it really knocks out everything.\n\n1:46:36.780 --> 1:46:40.460\n Because I used to wear earplugs to it, like just see if I can block it out.\n\n1:46:40.460 --> 1:46:46.820\n And like the moment I put it on, something, it's as if my mind was waiting\n\n1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:49.900\n all these years to hear that sound.\n\n1:46:49.900 --> 1:46:52.220\n Everything just focused in, I listened.\n\n1:46:52.220 --> 1:46:55.940\n It makes me wonder how many other amazing things out there they're waiting to\n\n1:46:55.940 --> 1:47:01.580\n discover from my own particular, like biological, from my own particular brain.\n\n1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:06.980\n So that, it just goes, the mind just focuses in, it's kind of incredible.\n\n1:47:06.980 --> 1:47:13.460\n So I see that as a kind of meditation, maybe I'm using a performance enhancing\n\n1:47:13.460 --> 1:47:17.780\n sound to achieve that meditation, but I've been doing that for many years now\n\n1:47:17.780 --> 1:47:22.780\n and running and walking and doing, Cal Newport was the first person that\n\n1:47:22.780 --> 1:47:24.740\n introduced me to the idea of deep work.\n\n1:47:24.740 --> 1:47:30.460\n Just put a word to the kind of thinking that's required to sort of deeply think\n\n1:47:30.460 --> 1:47:33.300\n about a problem, especially if it's mathematical in nature.\n\n1:47:33.300 --> 1:47:37.900\n I see that as a kind of meditation because what it's doing is you have\n\n1:47:37.900 --> 1:47:40.980\n these constructs in your mind that you're building on top of each other.\n\n1:47:40.980 --> 1:47:44.540\n And there's all these distracting thoughts that keep bombarding you\n\n1:47:44.540 --> 1:47:45.780\n from all over the place.\n\n1:47:45.780 --> 1:47:50.060\n And the whole process is you slowly let them kind of move past you.\n\n1:47:50.060 --> 1:47:51.300\n And that's a meditative process.\n\n1:47:51.300 --> 1:47:52.180\n It's very meditative.\n\n1:47:52.180 --> 1:47:57.020\n That sounds a lot like what Sam talks about in his meditation app, which I did\n\n1:47:57.020 --> 1:48:01.860\n use to be clear for a while, of just letting the thought go by without\n\n1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:02.460\n deranging you.\n\n1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:06.140\n Derangement is one of Sam's favorite words, as I'm sure you know.\n\n1:48:06.140 --> 1:48:08.460\n But brown noise, that's really intriguing.\n\n1:48:08.460 --> 1:48:11.540\n I am going to try that as soon as this evening.\n\n1:48:11.540 --> 1:48:14.500\n Yeah, to see if it works, but very well might not work at all.\n\n1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:15.740\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:48:15.740 --> 1:48:20.060\n I think the interesting point is, and the same with the fasting and the diet,\n\n1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:29.460\n is I long ago stopped trusting experts or maybe taking the word of experts\n\n1:48:29.460 --> 1:48:37.180\n as the gospel truth and only using it as an inspiration to try something,\n\n1:48:37.180 --> 1:48:39.740\n to try thoroughly something.\n\n1:48:39.740 --> 1:48:44.700\n So fasting was one of the things when I first discovered I've been many times\n\n1:48:44.700 --> 1:48:49.180\n eating just once a day, so that's a 24 hour fast.\n\n1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:50.740\n It makes me feel amazing.\n\n1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:56.420\n And at the same time, eating only meat, putting ethical concerns aside,\n\n1:48:56.420 --> 1:48:57.820\n makes me feel amazing.\n\n1:48:57.820 --> 1:49:02.860\n I don't know why it doesn't, the point is to be an N of one scientist\n\n1:49:02.860 --> 1:49:07.740\n until nutrition science becomes a real science to where it's doing like studies\n\n1:49:07.740 --> 1:49:14.380\n that deeply understand the biology underlying all of it and also does real\n\n1:49:14.380 --> 1:49:23.460\n thorough long term studies of thousands, if not millions of people versus a very\n\n1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:29.060\n like small studies that are kind of generalizing from very noisy data and all\n\n1:49:29.060 --> 1:49:32.260\n those kinds of things where you can't control all the elements.\n\n1:49:32.260 --> 1:49:36.900\n Particularly because our own personal metabolism is highly variant among us.\n\n1:49:36.900 --> 1:49:41.180\n So there are going to be some people like if brown noise is a game changer\n\n1:49:41.180 --> 1:49:46.820\n for 7% of people, there's 93% odds that I'm not one of them,\n\n1:49:46.820 --> 1:49:49.900\n but there's certainly every reason in the world to test it out.\n\n1:49:49.900 --> 1:49:51.860\n Now, so I'm intrigued by the fasting.\n\n1:49:51.860 --> 1:49:56.380\n I like you, well, I assume like you, I don't have any problem going to one meal\n\n1:49:56.380 --> 1:50:00.740\n a day and I often do that inadvertently and I've never done it methodically.\n\n1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:03.620\n Like I've never done it like I'm going to do this for 15 days.\n\n1:50:03.620 --> 1:50:05.820\n Maybe I should and maybe I should.\n\n1:50:05.820 --> 1:50:09.900\n Like how many, how many days in a row of the one day, one meal a day did you\n\n1:50:09.900 --> 1:50:13.460\n find brought noticeable impact to you?\n\n1:50:13.460 --> 1:50:14.740\n Was it after three days of it?\n\n1:50:14.740 --> 1:50:15.740\n Was it months of it?\n\n1:50:15.740 --> 1:50:16.460\n Like what was it?\n\n1:50:17.020 --> 1:50:19.180\n Well, the noticeable impact is day one.\n\n1:50:19.180 --> 1:50:22.780\n So for me, folks, cause I eat a very low carb diet.\n\n1:50:22.780 --> 1:50:25.420\n So the hunger wasn't the hugest issue.\n\n1:50:25.420 --> 1:50:29.660\n Like there wasn't a painful hunger, like wanting to eat.\n\n1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:31.980\n So I was already kind of primed for it.\n\n1:50:31.980 --> 1:50:36.700\n And the benefit comes from a lot of people that do intermittent fasting.\n\n1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:41.300\n That's only like 16 hours of fasting get this benefit too is the focus.\n\n1:50:41.300 --> 1:50:43.140\n There's a clarity of thought.\n\n1:50:43.140 --> 1:50:49.140\n If my brain was a runner, it felt like I'm running on a track when\n\n1:50:49.140 --> 1:50:53.300\n I'm fasting versus running in quicksand, like it's much crisper.\n\n1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:54.980\n And is this your first 72 hour fast?\n\n1:50:54.980 --> 1:50:56.660\n This is the first time doing 72 hours.\n\n1:50:56.660 --> 1:50:56.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:56.860 --> 1:51:01.940\n And that's a different thing, but similar, like I'm going up and\n\n1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:06.500\n down in terms of, in terms of hunger and the focus is really crisp.\n\n1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:12.980\n The thing I'm noticing most of all, to be honest, is how much eating, even\n\n1:51:12.980 --> 1:51:18.340\n when it's once a day or twice a day is a big part of my life.\n\n1:51:18.340 --> 1:51:22.580\n Like I almost feel like I have way more time in my life and it's not so\n\n1:51:22.580 --> 1:51:26.980\n much about the eating, but like, I don't have to plan my day around like\n\n1:51:26.980 --> 1:51:29.380\n today, I don't have any eating to do.\n\n1:51:30.420 --> 1:51:35.140\n It does free up hours or any cleaning up after eating or provisioning the food.\n\n1:51:35.140 --> 1:51:38.500\n But like, or even like thinking about it's not a thing.\n\n1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:43.620\n Like, so when you think about what you're going to do tonight, I think I'm\n\n1:51:43.620 --> 1:51:47.060\n realizing that as opposed to thinking, you know, I'm going to work on this\n\n1:51:47.060 --> 1:51:51.380\n problem or I'm going to go on this walk, or I'm going to call this person.\n\n1:51:51.380 --> 1:51:53.460\n I often think I'm going to eat this thing.\n\n1:51:54.740 --> 1:51:59.060\n You allow dinner as a kind of, you know, when people talk about like the\n\n1:51:59.060 --> 1:52:02.020\n weather or something like that, it's almost like a generic thought you\n\n1:52:02.020 --> 1:52:06.580\n allow yourself to have because, because it's the lazy thought.\n\n1:52:06.580 --> 1:52:09.860\n And I don't have the opportunity to have that thought because I'm not eating it.\n\n1:52:10.420 --> 1:52:13.620\n So now I get to think about like the things I'm actually going to do tonight\n\n1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:16.580\n that are more complicated than the eating process.\n\n1:52:16.580 --> 1:52:19.620\n That's, that's been the most noticeable thing to be honest.\n\n1:52:20.180 --> 1:52:24.980\n And then there's people that have written me that have done seven day fast.\n\n1:52:24.980 --> 1:52:30.420\n And there's a few people that have written me and I've heard of this is doing 30 day fasts.\n\n1:52:31.300 --> 1:52:32.580\n And it's interesting.\n\n1:52:32.580 --> 1:52:36.020\n The body, I don't know what the health benefits are necessarily.\n\n1:52:37.060 --> 1:52:41.300\n What that shows me is how adaptable the human body is.\n\n1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:42.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:43.940\n And, and that's incredible.\n\n1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:47.140\n And that's something really important to remember when we\n\n1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:50.500\n think about how to live life because the body adapts.\n\n1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:50.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:50.740 --> 1:52:53.220\n I mean, we sure couldn't go 30 days without water.\n\n1:52:53.220 --> 1:52:53.700\n That's right.\n\n1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:56.100\n But food, yeah, it's been done.\n\n1:52:56.100 --> 1:52:57.380\n It's demonstrably possible.\n\n1:52:57.380 --> 1:53:01.860\n You ever read Franz Kafka has a great short story called The Hunger Artist?\n\n1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:02.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:02.100 --> 1:53:02.660\n I love that.\n\n1:53:03.300 --> 1:53:03.940\n Great story.\n\n1:53:04.980 --> 1:53:06.580\n You know, that was before I started fasting.\n\n1:53:06.580 --> 1:53:11.220\n I read that story and I, I, I admired the beauty of that, the artistry of that actual\n\n1:53:11.220 --> 1:53:16.660\n hunger artist that it's like madness, but it also felt like a little bit of genius.\n\n1:53:16.660 --> 1:53:18.100\n I actually have to reread it.\n\n1:53:18.100 --> 1:53:18.420\n You know what?\n\n1:53:18.420 --> 1:53:19.380\n That's what I'm going to do tonight.\n\n1:53:19.380 --> 1:53:21.620\n I'm going to read it because I'm doing the fast.\n\n1:53:21.620 --> 1:53:22.500\n Because you're in the midst of it.\n\n1:53:22.500 --> 1:53:22.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:22.820 --> 1:53:23.780\n Be very contextual.\n\n1:53:23.780 --> 1:53:25.780\n I haven't read it since high school and I love to read it again.\n\n1:53:25.780 --> 1:53:26.580\n I love his work.\n\n1:53:26.580 --> 1:53:28.180\n So maybe I'll read it tonight too.\n\n1:53:28.180 --> 1:53:34.180\n And part of the reason of sort of I've here in Texas, people have been so friendly that\n\n1:53:34.180 --> 1:53:39.940\n I've been nonstop eating like brisket with incredible people, a lot of whiskey as well.\n\n1:53:39.940 --> 1:53:43.300\n So I gained quite a bit of weight, which I'm embracing.\n\n1:53:43.300 --> 1:53:43.700\n It's okay.\n\n1:53:44.340 --> 1:53:52.260\n But I am also aware as I'm fasting that like I have a lot of fat for, for to, to run on.\n\n1:53:52.260 --> 1:53:57.300\n Like I have a lot of like natural resources on my body.\n\n1:53:57.300 --> 1:53:58.100\n You've got reserves.\n\n1:53:58.100 --> 1:53:58.500\n Reserves.\n\n1:53:58.500 --> 1:53:59.780\n You got reserves, yeah.\n\n1:53:59.780 --> 1:54:01.220\n And that's, that's really cool.\n\n1:54:01.220 --> 1:54:05.460\n You know, there's like a re this whole thing, this biology works well.\n\n1:54:05.460 --> 1:54:10.740\n Like I can go a long time because of the, the longterm investing in terms of brisket\n\n1:54:10.740 --> 1:54:12.500\n that I've been doing in the weeks before.\n\n1:54:12.500 --> 1:54:13.380\n So it's all training.\n\n1:54:13.380 --> 1:54:14.100\n It's all training.\n\n1:54:14.100 --> 1:54:14.580\n All prep work.\n\n1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:15.300\n All prep work.\n\n1:54:15.300 --> 1:54:15.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:15.620 --> 1:54:16.100\n So, okay.\n\n1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:18.660\n You open a bunch of doors, one of which is music.\n\n1:54:18.660 --> 1:54:21.380\n I, so I got to walk in at least for a brief moment.\n\n1:54:21.380 --> 1:54:22.180\n I love guitar.\n\n1:54:22.180 --> 1:54:22.820\n I love music.\n\n1:54:23.380 --> 1:54:27.300\n You founded a music company, but you're also a musician yourself.\n\n1:54:27.860 --> 1:54:30.260\n You know, let me ask the big ridiculous question first.\n\n1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:32.180\n What's the greatest song of all time?\n\n1:54:32.180 --> 1:54:34.500\n Greatest song of all time.\n\n1:54:34.500 --> 1:54:34.820\n Okay.\n\n1:54:34.820 --> 1:54:35.140\n Wow.\n\n1:54:35.140 --> 1:54:39.140\n It's, it's going to obviously very dramatically from genre to genre.\n\n1:54:39.140 --> 1:54:47.060\n So like you, I like guitar, perhaps like you, although I've dabbled in, in inhaling\n\n1:54:47.060 --> 1:54:51.220\n every genre of music that I can almost practically imagine.\n\n1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:57.700\n I keep coming back to, you know, the sound of bass, guitar, drum, keyboards, voice.\n\n1:54:57.700 --> 1:55:00.100\n I love that style of music and added to it.\n\n1:55:00.100 --> 1:55:05.620\n I think a lot of really cool electronic production makes something that's really,\n\n1:55:05.620 --> 1:55:08.340\n really new and hybridy and awesome.\n\n1:55:08.900 --> 1:55:15.620\n But, you know, and that kind of like guitar based rock I think I've got to go with\n\n1:55:15.620 --> 1:55:17.140\n won't get fooled again by the who.\n\n1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:21.380\n It is such an epic song.\n\n1:55:21.380 --> 1:55:23.220\n It's got so much grandeur to it.\n\n1:55:23.860 --> 1:55:27.380\n It uses the synthesizers that were available at the time.\n\n1:55:27.380 --> 1:55:31.940\n This has got to be, I think, 1972, 73, which are very, very primitive to our ears,\n\n1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:38.340\n but uses them in this hypnotic and beautiful way that I can't imagine somebody with the\n\n1:55:38.340 --> 1:55:43.700\n greatest synth array conceivable by today's technology could do a better job of in the\n\n1:55:43.700 --> 1:55:45.060\n context of that song.\n\n1:55:45.700 --> 1:55:49.140\n And it's, you know, almost operatic.\n\n1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:56.180\n So I would say in that genre, the genre of, you know, rock that would be my nomination.\n\n1:55:56.180 --> 1:55:58.740\n I'm totally in my brain.\n\n1:55:58.740 --> 1:56:04.100\n Pinball Wizard is overriding everything else, but it was so like, I can't even imagine the\n\n1:56:04.100 --> 1:56:04.500\n song.\n\n1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:07.380\n Well, I would say, ironically, with Pinball Wizard.\n\n1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:09.060\n So that came from the movie Tommy.\n\n1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:16.820\n And in the movie, Tommy, the rival of Tommy, the reigning pinball champ was Elton John.\n\n1:56:17.380 --> 1:56:20.500\n And so there are a couple of versions of Pinball Wizard out there.\n\n1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:24.420\n One sung by Roger Daltrey of The Who, which a purist would say, hey, that's the real\n\n1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:25.540\n pinball wizard.\n\n1:56:25.540 --> 1:56:30.740\n But the version that is sung by Elton John in the movie, which is available to those\n\n1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:35.140\n who are ambitious and want to dig for it, that's even better in my mind.\n\n1:56:35.140 --> 1:56:36.100\n Yeah, the covers.\n\n1:56:36.100 --> 1:56:40.100\n And I, for myself, I was thinking, what is the song for me?\n\n1:56:40.820 --> 1:56:41.860\n They answered that question.\n\n1:56:42.900 --> 1:56:45.860\n I think that changes day to day, too.\n\n1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:46.740\n I was realizing that.\n\n1:56:46.740 --> 1:56:55.780\n Of course, but for me, somebody who values lyrics as well and the emotion in the song.\n\n1:56:57.060 --> 1:56:59.940\n By the way, Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen was a close one.\n\n1:56:59.940 --> 1:57:10.900\n But the number one is Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt that is, there's something so powerful\n\n1:57:10.900 --> 1:57:15.140\n about that song, about that cover, about that performance.\n\n1:57:15.140 --> 1:57:17.540\n Maybe another one is the cover of Sound of Silence.\n\n1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:21.700\n Maybe there's something about covers for me.\n\n1:57:21.700 --> 1:57:22.980\n So whose cover sounds?\n\n1:57:22.980 --> 1:57:26.180\n Because Simon and Garfunkel, I think, did the original recording of that, right?\n\n1:57:26.180 --> 1:57:28.020\n So which cover is it that?\n\n1:57:28.020 --> 1:57:31.540\n There's a cover by Disturbed.\n\n1:57:31.540 --> 1:57:35.940\n It's a metal band, which is so interesting because I'm really not into that kind of metal.\n\n1:57:35.940 --> 1:57:38.420\n But he does a pure vocal performance.\n\n1:57:38.420 --> 1:57:41.220\n So he's not doing a metal performance.\n\n1:57:41.220 --> 1:57:44.100\n I would say it's one of the greatest people should see it.\n\n1:57:44.100 --> 1:57:47.300\n It's like 400 million views or something like that.\n\n1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:54.900\n It's probably the greatest live vocal performance I've ever heard is Disturbed covering Sound\n\n1:57:54.900 --> 1:57:55.460\n of Silence.\n\n1:57:55.460 --> 1:57:56.980\n I'll listen to it as soon as I get home.\n\n1:57:56.980 --> 1:58:00.260\n And that song came to life to me in a way that Simon and Garfunkel never did.\n\n1:58:01.300 --> 1:58:07.300\n For me with Simon and Garfunkel, there's not a pain, there's not an anger, there's not\n\n1:58:09.940 --> 1:58:11.700\n power to their performance.\n\n1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:15.140\n It's almost like this melancholy, I don't know.\n\n1:58:15.140 --> 1:58:20.660\n Well, I guess there's a lot of beauty to it, objectively beautiful.\n\n1:58:21.460 --> 1:58:26.340\n I think, I never thought of this until now, but I think if you put entirely different\n\n1:58:26.340 --> 1:58:32.020\n lyrics on top of it, unless they were joyous, which would be weird, it wouldn't necessarily\n\n1:58:32.020 --> 1:58:32.980\n lose that much.\n\n1:58:32.980 --> 1:58:34.900\n There's just a beauty in the harmonizing.\n\n1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:36.580\n It's soft and you're right.\n\n1:58:36.580 --> 1:58:40.500\n It's not dripping with emotion.\n\n1:58:40.500 --> 1:58:48.100\n The vocal performance is not dripping with emotion, it's dripping with technical harmonizing\n\n1:58:48.100 --> 1:58:49.300\n brilliance and beauty.\n\n1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:56.020\n Now, if you compare that to the Disturbed cover or the Johnny Cash's Hurt cover, when\n\n1:58:56.020 --> 1:58:59.780\n you walk away, it's haunting.\n\n1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:02.500\n It stays with you for a long time.\n\n1:59:02.500 --> 1:59:11.540\n There's certain performances that will just stay with you to where, like if you watch\n\n1:59:11.540 --> 1:59:15.700\n people respond to that, and that's certainly how I felt when you listen to that, the Disturbed\n\n1:59:15.700 --> 1:59:20.820\n performance or Johnny Cash Hurt, there's a response to where you just sit there with\n\n1:59:20.820 --> 1:59:24.980\n your mouth open, kind of like paralyzed by it somehow.\n\n1:59:26.260 --> 1:59:31.300\n And I think that's what makes for a great song to where you're just like, it's not\n\n1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:36.500\n that you're like singing along or having fun, that's another way a song could be great,\n\n1:59:36.500 --> 1:59:40.740\n but where you're just like, you're in awe.\n\n1:59:41.940 --> 1:59:50.180\n If we go to listen.com and that whole fascinating era of music in the 90s, transitioning to\n\n1:59:50.180 --> 1:59:58.500\n the aughts, I remember those days, the Napster days, when piracy, from my perspective, allegedly\n\n1:59:58.500 --> 2:00:01.540\n ruled the land.\n\n2:00:01.540 --> 2:00:03.780\n What do you make of that whole era?\n\n2:00:03.780 --> 2:00:08.420\n What are the big, what was, first of all, your experiences of that era and what were\n\n2:00:08.420 --> 2:00:15.140\n the big takeaways in terms of piracy, in terms of what it takes to build a company that succeeds\n\n2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:22.020\n in that kind of digital space, in terms of music, but in terms of anything creative?\n\n2:00:22.020 --> 2:00:27.460\n Well, so for those who don't remember, which is going to be most folks, listen.com created\n\n2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:31.700\n a service called Rhapsody, which is much, much more recognizable to folks because Rhapsody\n\n2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:34.180\n became a pretty big name for reasons that I'll get into in a second.\n\n2:00:34.180 --> 2:00:39.940\n So for people who don't know their early online music history, we were the first company,\n\n2:00:39.940 --> 2:00:46.260\n so I founded, listen, I was a loan founder, and Rhapsody, we were the first service to\n\n2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:51.860\n get full catalog licenses from all the major music labels in order to distribute their\n\n2:00:51.860 --> 2:00:56.420\n music online, and we specifically did it through a mechanism which at the time struck people\n\n2:00:56.420 --> 2:01:01.780\n as exotic and bizarre and kind of incomprehensible, which was unlimited on demand streaming, which\n\n2:01:01.780 --> 2:01:08.180\n of course now it's a model that's been appropriated by Spotify and Apple and many, many others.\n\n2:01:08.180 --> 2:01:10.180\n So we were a pioneer on that front.\n\n2:01:10.180 --> 2:01:16.100\n What was really, really, really hard about doing business in those days was the reaction\n\n2:01:16.100 --> 2:01:22.020\n of the music labels to piracy, which was about 180 degrees opposite of what the reaction\n\n2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:26.820\n quote unquote should have been from the standpoint of preserving their business from piracy.\n\n2:01:26.820 --> 2:01:35.940\n So Napster came along and was a service that enabled people to get near unlimited access\n\n2:01:35.940 --> 2:01:38.420\n to most songs.\n\n2:01:38.420 --> 2:01:43.300\n I mean, truly obscure things could be very hard to find on Napster, but most songs with\n\n2:01:43.300 --> 2:01:50.580\n a relatively simple one click ability to download those songs and have the MP3s on their hard\n\n2:01:50.580 --> 2:01:55.380\n drives, but there was a lot that was very messy about the Napster experience.\n\n2:01:55.380 --> 2:01:59.540\n You might download a really god awful recording of that song.\n\n2:01:59.540 --> 2:02:04.180\n You may download a recording that actually wasn't that song with some prankster putting\n\n2:02:04.180 --> 2:02:06.100\n it up to sort of mess with people.\n\n2:02:06.660 --> 2:02:09.140\n You could struggle to find the song that you're looking for.\n\n2:02:09.140 --> 2:02:13.060\n You could end up finding yourself connected, it was peer to peer.\n\n2:02:13.060 --> 2:02:17.300\n You might randomly find yourself connected to somebody in Bulgaria, doesn't have a very\n\n2:02:17.300 --> 2:02:18.340\n good internet connection.\n\n2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:23.140\n So you might wait 19 minutes only for it to snap, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:02:23.140 --> 2:02:27.700\n And our argument to, well, actually let's start with how that hit the music labels.\n\n2:02:27.700 --> 2:02:32.900\n The music labels had been in a very, very comfortable position for many, many decades\n\n2:02:32.900 --> 2:02:41.940\n of essentially being the monopoly providers of a certain subset of artists.\n\n2:02:41.940 --> 2:02:46.740\n Any given label was a monopoly provider of the artists and the recordings that they owned\n\n2:02:46.740 --> 2:02:51.540\n and they could sell it at what turned out to be tremendously favorable rates.\n\n2:02:51.540 --> 2:02:57.860\n In the late era of the CD, you were talking close to $20 for a compact disc that might\n\n2:02:57.860 --> 2:03:02.580\n have one song that you were crazy about and simply needed to own that might actually be\n\n2:03:02.580 --> 2:03:05.380\n glued to 17 other songs that you found to be sure crap.\n\n2:03:05.940 --> 2:03:13.860\n And so the music industry had used the fact that it had this unbelievable leverage and\n\n2:03:13.860 --> 2:03:20.340\n profound pricing power to really get music lovers to the point that they felt very, very\n\n2:03:20.340 --> 2:03:22.500\n misused by the entire situation.\n\n2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:28.820\n Now along comes Napster and music sales start getting gutted with extreme rapidity.\n\n2:03:29.380 --> 2:03:37.460\n And the reaction of the music industry to that was one of shock and absolute fury, which\n\n2:03:37.460 --> 2:03:38.420\n is understandable.\n\n2:03:38.420 --> 2:03:43.620\n I mean, industries do get gutted all the time, but I struggle to think of an analog of an\n\n2:03:43.620 --> 2:03:46.340\n industry that got gutted that rapidly.\n\n2:03:46.340 --> 2:03:51.220\n I mean, we could say that passenger train service certainly got gutted by airlines,\n\n2:03:51.220 --> 2:03:54.900\n but that was a process that took place over decades and decades and decades.\n\n2:03:54.900 --> 2:03:59.300\n It wasn't something that happened, really started showing up in the numbers in a single\n\n2:03:59.300 --> 2:04:04.020\n digit number of months and started looking like an existential threat within a year or\n\n2:04:04.020 --> 2:04:04.580\n two.\n\n2:04:04.580 --> 2:04:10.020\n So the music industry is quite understandably in a state of shock and fury.\n\n2:04:10.020 --> 2:04:11.220\n I don't blame them for that.\n\n2:04:11.780 --> 2:04:18.020\n But then their reaction was catastrophic, both for themselves and almost for people\n\n2:04:18.020 --> 2:04:23.140\n like us who were trying to do the cowboy in the white hat thing.\n\n2:04:23.140 --> 2:04:28.260\n So our response to the music industry was, look, what you need to do to fight piracy,\n\n2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:30.180\n you can't put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n2:04:30.180 --> 2:04:32.500\n You can't switch off the internet.\n\n2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:37.300\n Even if you all shut your eyes and wish very, very, very hard, the internet is not going\n\n2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:38.100\n away.\n\n2:04:38.100 --> 2:04:40.900\n And these peer to peer technologies are genies out of the bottle.\n\n2:04:40.900 --> 2:04:47.300\n And if you don't, whatever you do, don't shut down Napster because if you do, suddenly\n\n2:04:47.300 --> 2:04:51.220\n that technology is going to splinter into 30 different nodes that you'll never, ever\n\n2:04:51.220 --> 2:04:52.180\n be able to shut off.\n\n2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:59.140\n We suggested to them is like, look, what you want to do is to create a massively better\n\n2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:04.260\n experience to piracy, something that's way better, that you sell at a completely reasonable\n\n2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:04.980\n price.\n\n2:05:04.980 --> 2:05:06.420\n And this is what it is.\n\n2:05:06.420 --> 2:05:10.580\n Don't just give people access to that very limited number of songs that they happen to\n\n2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:15.780\n have acquired and paid for or pirated and have on their hard drive.\n\n2:05:15.780 --> 2:05:19.460\n Give them access to all of the music in the world for a simple low price.\n\n2:05:19.460 --> 2:05:22.980\n And obviously, that doesn't sound like a crazy suggestion, I don't think, to anybody's\n\n2:05:22.980 --> 2:05:26.820\n ears today because that is how the majority of music is now being consumed online.\n\n2:05:26.820 --> 2:05:32.660\n But in doing that, you're going to create a much, much better option to this kind of\n\n2:05:32.660 --> 2:05:37.700\n crappy, kind of rickety, kind of buggy process of acquiring MP3s.\n\n2:05:37.700 --> 2:05:44.100\n Now, unfortunately, the music industry was so angry about Napster and so forth that for\n\n2:05:44.100 --> 2:05:48.900\n essentially three and a half years, they folded their arms, stamped their feet, and boycotted\n\n2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:49.780\n the internet.\n\n2:05:49.780 --> 2:05:54.660\n So they basically gave people who were fervently passionate about music and were digitally\n\n2:05:54.660 --> 2:05:57.460\n modern, they gave them basically one choice.\n\n2:05:57.460 --> 2:06:01.780\n If you want to have access to digital music, we, the music industry, insist that you steal\n\n2:06:01.780 --> 2:06:04.420\n it because we are not going to sell it to you.\n\n2:06:04.420 --> 2:06:10.340\n So what that did is it made an entire generation of people morally comfortable with swiping\n\n2:06:10.340 --> 2:06:14.180\n the music because they felt quite pragmatically, well, they're not giving me any choice here.\n\n2:06:14.180 --> 2:06:18.740\n It's like a 20 year old violating the 21 drinking age.\n\n2:06:18.740 --> 2:06:21.860\n If they do that, they're not going to feel like felons.\n\n2:06:21.860 --> 2:06:25.060\n They're going to be like, this is an unreasonable law and I'm skirting it, right?\n\n2:06:25.060 --> 2:06:29.700\n So they make a whole generation of people morally comfortable with swiping music, but\n\n2:06:29.700 --> 2:06:32.180\n also technically adept at it.\n\n2:06:32.180 --> 2:06:37.140\n And when they did shut down Napster and kind of even trickier tools and like tweakier tools\n\n2:06:37.140 --> 2:06:41.540\n like Kazaa and so forth came along, people just figured out how to do it.\n\n2:06:41.540 --> 2:06:48.660\n So by the time they finally, grudgingly, it took years, allowed us to release this experience\n\n2:06:48.660 --> 2:06:53.780\n that we were quite convinced would be better than piracy, we had this enormous hole had\n\n2:06:53.780 --> 2:06:59.620\n been dug where lots of people said, music is a thing that is free and that's morally\n\n2:06:59.620 --> 2:07:01.700\n okay and I know how to get it.\n\n2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:08.660\n And so streaming took many, many, many more years to take off and become the gargantuan\n\n2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:14.820\n thing the juggernaut is today than would have happened if they'd made, pivoted to let's\n\n2:07:14.820 --> 2:07:19.700\n sell a better experience as opposed to demand that people want digital music, steal it.\n\n2:07:19.700 --> 2:07:21.460\n Like what lessons do we draw from that?\n\n2:07:21.460 --> 2:07:26.660\n Cause we're probably in the midst of living through a bunch of similar situations in different\n\n2:07:26.660 --> 2:07:27.460\n domains currently.\n\n2:07:27.460 --> 2:07:28.100\n We just don't know.\n\n2:07:28.100 --> 2:07:30.420\n There's a lot of things in this world that are really painful.\n\n2:07:31.220 --> 2:07:37.220\n Like, I mean, I don't know if you can draw perfect parallels, but fiat money versus cryptocurrency,\n\n2:07:37.220 --> 2:07:42.420\n there's a lot of currently people in power who are kind of very skeptical about cryptocurrency,\n\n2:07:42.420 --> 2:07:43.780\n although that's changing.\n\n2:07:43.780 --> 2:07:45.860\n But it's arguable it's changing way too slowly.\n\n2:07:45.860 --> 2:07:49.780\n There's a lot of people making that argument where there should be a complete like Coinbase\n\n2:07:49.780 --> 2:07:51.620\n and all this stuff switched to that.\n\n2:07:52.660 --> 2:08:00.260\n There's a lot of other domains that where a pivot, like if you pivot now, you're going\n\n2:08:00.260 --> 2:08:04.500\n to win big, but you don't pivot because you're stubborn.\n\n2:08:05.380 --> 2:08:09.380\n And it's so, I mean, like, is this just the way that companies are?\n\n2:08:09.380 --> 2:08:15.300\n A company succeeds initially and then it grows and there's a huge number of employees and\n\n2:08:15.300 --> 2:08:21.540\n managers that don't have the guts or the institutional mechanisms to do the pivot.\n\n2:08:21.540 --> 2:08:22.900\n Is that just the way of companies?\n\n2:08:23.460 --> 2:08:26.500\n Well, I think what happens, I'll use the case of the music industry.\n\n2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:32.580\n There was an economic model that had put food on the table and paid for marble lobbies and\n\n2:08:32.580 --> 2:08:37.140\n seven and even eight figure executive salaries for many, many decades, which was the physical\n\n2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:38.580\n collection of music.\n\n2:08:38.580 --> 2:08:44.820\n And then you start talking about something like unlimited streaming and it seems so ephemeral\n\n2:08:44.820 --> 2:08:50.020\n and like such a long shot that people start worrying about cannibalizing their own business\n\n2:08:50.020 --> 2:08:54.500\n and they lose sight of the fact that something illicit is cannibalizing their business at\n\n2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:56.020\n an extraordinarily fast rate.\n\n2:08:56.020 --> 2:08:58.500\n And so if they don't do it themselves, they're doomed.\n\n2:08:58.500 --> 2:09:02.660\n I mean, we used to put slides in front of these folks, this is really funny, where we\n\n2:09:02.660 --> 2:09:08.180\n said, okay, let's assume Rhapsody, we want it to be 9.99 a month and we want it to be\n\n2:09:08.180 --> 2:09:13.700\n 12 months, so it's $120 a year from the budget of a music lover.\n\n2:09:13.700 --> 2:09:18.340\n And then we were also able to get reasonably accurate statistics that showed how many CDs\n\n2:09:18.340 --> 2:09:23.380\n per year the average person who bothered to collect music, which was not all people, actually\n\n2:09:23.380 --> 2:09:24.180\n bought.\n\n2:09:24.180 --> 2:09:29.620\n And it was overwhelmingly clear that the average CD buyer spends a hell of a lot less than\n\n2:09:29.620 --> 2:09:32.820\n $120 a year on music.\n\n2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:35.220\n This is a revenue expansion, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:09:35.220 --> 2:09:40.820\n But all they could think of, and I'm not saying this in a pejorative or patronizing way, I\n\n2:09:40.820 --> 2:09:44.500\n don't blame them, they've grown up in this environment for decades, all they could think\n\n2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:47.540\n of was the incredible margins that they had on a CD.\n\n2:09:48.340 --> 2:09:55.060\n And they would say, well, if this CD, by the mechanism that you guys are proposing, the\n\n2:09:55.060 --> 2:10:00.980\n CD that I'm selling for $17.99, somebody would need to stream those songs.\n\n2:10:00.980 --> 2:10:04.100\n We were talking about a penny of playback then, it's less than that now that the record\n\n2:10:04.100 --> 2:10:05.380\n labels get paid.\n\n2:10:05.380 --> 2:10:10.500\n But would have to stream songs from that 1,799 times, it's never gonna happen.\n\n2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:13.700\n So they were just sort of stuck in the model of this, but it's like, no, dude, but they're\n\n2:10:13.700 --> 2:10:15.140\n gonna spend money on all this other stuff.\n\n2:10:15.140 --> 2:10:17.060\n So I think people get very hung up on that.\n\n2:10:17.060 --> 2:10:22.500\n I mean, another example is really the taxi industry was not monolithic, like the music\n\n2:10:22.500 --> 2:10:23.060\n labels.\n\n2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:26.100\n There was a whole bunch of fleets and a whole bunch of cities, very, very fragmented, it's\n\n2:10:26.100 --> 2:10:27.140\n an imperfect analogy.\n\n2:10:27.140 --> 2:10:34.020\n But nonetheless, imagine if the taxi industry writ large upon seeing Uber said, oh my God,\n\n2:10:34.020 --> 2:10:39.220\n people wanna be able to hail things easily, cheaply, they don't wanna mess with cash,\n\n2:10:39.220 --> 2:10:43.060\n they wanna know how many minutes it's gonna be, they wanna know the fare in advance, and\n\n2:10:43.060 --> 2:10:46.340\n they want a much bigger fleet than what we've got.\n\n2:10:46.340 --> 2:10:52.740\n If the taxi industry had rolled out something like that with the branding of yellow taxis,\n\n2:10:52.740 --> 2:10:58.660\n universally known and kind of loved by Americans and expanded their fleet in a necessary manner,\n\n2:10:58.660 --> 2:11:00.660\n I don't think Uber or Lyft ever would have gotten a foothold.\n\n2:11:01.940 --> 2:11:08.020\n But the problem there was that real economics in the taxi industry wasn't with fares, it\n\n2:11:08.020 --> 2:11:10.660\n was with the scarcity of medallions.\n\n2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:16.740\n And so the taxi fleets, in many cases, owned gazillions of medallions whose value came\n\n2:11:16.740 --> 2:11:18.500\n from their very scarcity.\n\n2:11:18.500 --> 2:11:21.060\n So they simply couldn't pivot to that.\n\n2:11:21.060 --> 2:11:25.860\n So I think you end up having these vested interests with economics that aren't necessarily\n\n2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:32.020\n visible to outsiders who get very, very reluctant to disrupt their own model, which is why it\n\n2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:34.660\n ends up coming from the outside so frequently.\n\n2:11:34.660 --> 2:11:39.220\n So you know what it takes to build a successful startup, but you're also an investor in a\n\n2:11:39.220 --> 2:11:40.580\n lot of successful startups.\n\n2:11:41.140 --> 2:11:42.900\n Let me ask for advice.\n\n2:11:43.860 --> 2:11:48.180\n What do you think it takes to build a successful startup by way of advice?\n\n2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:51.620\n JS Well, I think it starts, I mean, everything\n\n2:11:51.620 --> 2:11:54.500\n starts and even ends with the founder.\n\n2:11:54.500 --> 2:11:59.620\n And so I think it's really, really important to look at the founder's motivations and their\n\n2:11:59.620 --> 2:12:01.460\n sophistication about what they're doing.\n\n2:12:02.660 --> 2:12:08.180\n In almost all cases that I'm familiar with and have thought hard about, you've had a\n\n2:12:08.180 --> 2:12:15.300\n founder who was deeply, deeply inculcated in the domain of technology that they were\n\n2:12:15.300 --> 2:12:16.420\n taking on.\n\n2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:20.100\n Now, what's interesting about that is you could say, no, wait, how is that possible\n\n2:12:20.100 --> 2:12:21.540\n because there's so many young founders?\n\n2:12:21.540 --> 2:12:26.100\n When you look at young founders, they're generally coming out of very nascent emerging\n\n2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:31.860\n fields of technology where simply being present and accounted for and engaged in the community\n\n2:12:31.860 --> 2:12:36.820\n for a period of even months is enough time to make them very, very deeply inculcated.\n\n2:12:36.820 --> 2:12:39.460\n I mean, you look at Marc Andreessen and Netscape.\n\n2:12:41.140 --> 2:12:45.300\n Marc had been doing visual web browsers when Netscape had been founded for what, a year\n\n2:12:45.300 --> 2:12:51.380\n and a half, but he'd created the first one in Mosaic when he was an undergrad.\n\n2:12:51.380 --> 2:12:58.340\n And the commercial internet was pre nascent in 1994 when Netscape was founded.\n\n2:12:58.340 --> 2:13:00.580\n So there's somebody who's very, very deep in their domain.\n\n2:13:00.580 --> 2:13:04.340\n Mark Zuckerberg also, social networking, very deep in his domain, even though it was\n\n2:13:04.340 --> 2:13:05.300\n nascent at the time.\n\n2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:07.460\n Lots of people doing crypto stuff.\n\n2:13:07.460 --> 2:13:14.820\n I mean, 10 years ago, even seven or eight years ago, by being a really, really vehement\n\n2:13:14.820 --> 2:13:19.700\n and engaged participant in the crypto ecosystem, you could be an expert in that.\n\n2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:23.620\n You look, however, at more established industries, take Salesforce.com.\n\n2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:26.660\n Salesforce automation, pretty mature field when it got started.\n\n2:13:26.660 --> 2:13:28.100\n Who's the executive and the founder?\n\n2:13:28.820 --> 2:13:34.020\n Marc Benioff, who has spent 13 years at Oracle and was an investor in Siebel Systems, which\n\n2:13:34.020 --> 2:13:36.580\n ended up being Salesforce's main competition.\n\n2:13:36.580 --> 2:13:43.620\n So more established, you need the entrepreneur to be very, very deep in the technology and\n\n2:13:43.620 --> 2:13:50.500\n the culture of the space because you need that entrepreneur, that founder to have just\n\n2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:55.780\n an unbelievably accurate intuitive sense for where the puck is going.\n\n2:13:56.420 --> 2:13:58.980\n And that only comes from being very deep.\n\n2:13:58.980 --> 2:14:01.220\n So that is sort of factor number one.\n\n2:14:01.220 --> 2:14:08.260\n And the next thing is that that founder needs to be charismatic and or credible, or ideally\n\n2:14:08.260 --> 2:14:14.340\n both in exactly the right ways to be able to attract a team that is bought into that\n\n2:14:14.340 --> 2:14:19.220\n vision and is bought into that founder's intuitions being correct and not just the team,\n\n2:14:19.220 --> 2:14:21.380\n obviously, but also the investors.\n\n2:14:21.380 --> 2:14:25.540\n So it takes a certain personality type to pull that off.\n\n2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:31.540\n Then the next thing I'm still talking about the founder is a relentlessness and indeed\n\n2:14:31.540 --> 2:14:39.540\n a monomania to put this above things that might rationally, should perhaps rationally\n\n2:14:39.540 --> 2:14:46.500\n supersede it for a period of time to just relentlessly pivot when pivoting is called\n\n2:14:46.500 --> 2:14:48.020\n for and it's always called for.\n\n2:14:48.020 --> 2:14:53.300\n I mean, think of even very successful companies like how many times did Facebook pivot?\n\n2:14:53.940 --> 2:14:58.180\n Newsfeed was something that was completely alien to the original version of Facebook\n\n2:14:58.180 --> 2:15:00.020\n and came foundationally important.\n\n2:15:00.020 --> 2:15:03.860\n How many times did Google, how many times at any given, how many times has Apple pivoted?\n\n2:15:04.820 --> 2:15:09.220\n That founder energy and DNA when the founder moves on the DNA that's been inculcated\n\n2:15:09.220 --> 2:15:15.220\n with a company has to have that relentlessness and that ability to pivot and pivot and pivot\n\n2:15:15.220 --> 2:15:18.100\n without being worried about sacred cows.\n\n2:15:18.100 --> 2:15:21.300\n And then the last thing I'll say about the founder before I get to the rest of the team\n\n2:15:21.300 --> 2:15:28.100\n and that'll be mercifully brief is the founder has to be obviously a really great\n\n2:15:28.100 --> 2:15:32.820\n hirer but just important a very good firer.\n\n2:15:32.820 --> 2:15:37.860\n And firing is a horrific experience for both people involved in it.\n\n2:15:37.860 --> 2:15:40.100\n It is a wrenching emotional experience.\n\n2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:49.060\n And being good at realizing when this particular person is damaging the interests of the company\n\n2:15:49.060 --> 2:15:56.660\n and the team and the shareholders and having the intestinal fortitude to have that conversation\n\n2:15:56.660 --> 2:16:01.060\n and make it happen is something that most people don't have in them.\n\n2:16:01.620 --> 2:16:07.300\n And it's something that needs to be developed in most people or maybe some people have it\n\n2:16:07.300 --> 2:16:08.340\n naturally.\n\n2:16:08.340 --> 2:16:13.940\n But without that ability, that will take an A plus organization into B minus range very,\n\n2:16:13.940 --> 2:16:14.580\n very quickly.\n\n2:16:15.220 --> 2:16:19.140\n And so that's all what needs to be present in the founder.\n\n2:16:19.140 --> 2:16:20.660\n Can I just say?\n\n2:16:20.660 --> 2:16:21.220\n Sure.\n\n2:16:21.220 --> 2:16:22.820\n How damn good you are, Rob.\n\n2:16:22.820 --> 2:16:24.100\n That was brilliant.\n\n2:16:24.100 --> 2:16:29.780\n The one thing that was kind of really kind of surprising to me is having a deep technical\n\n2:16:29.780 --> 2:16:37.380\n knowledge because I think the way you expressed it, which is that allows you to be really\n\n2:16:37.380 --> 2:16:40.660\n honest with the capabilities of what like what's possible.\n\n2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:47.700\n Of course, you're often trying to do the impossible.\n\n2:16:48.740 --> 2:16:51.860\n But in order to do the impossible, you have to be quote unquote impossible.\n\n2:16:51.860 --> 2:16:54.660\n But you have to be honest with what is actually possible.\n\n2:16:54.660 --> 2:16:57.620\n And it doesn't necessarily have to be the technical competence.\n\n2:16:57.620 --> 2:17:02.660\n It's got to be, in my view, just a complete immersion in that emerging market.\n\n2:17:02.660 --> 2:17:06.180\n And so I can imagine there are a couple of people out there who have started really good\n\n2:17:06.180 --> 2:17:12.500\n crypto projects who themselves are right in the code, but they're immersed in the culture\n\n2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:16.820\n and through the culture and a deep understanding of what's happening and what's not happening.\n\n2:17:16.820 --> 2:17:23.460\n They can get a good intuition of what's possible, but the very first hire, I mean, a great way\n\n2:17:23.460 --> 2:17:28.980\n to solve that is to have a technical co founder and dual founder companies have become extremely\n\n2:17:28.980 --> 2:17:30.180\n common for that reason.\n\n2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:34.980\n And if you're not doing that and you're not the technical person, but you are the founder,\n\n2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:43.780\n you've got to be really great at hiring a very damn good technical person very, very fast.\n\n2:17:43.780 --> 2:17:49.140\n Can I on the founder ask you, is it possible to do this alone?\n\n2:17:50.100 --> 2:17:54.660\n There's so many people giving advice and saying that it's impossible to do the first few steps,\n\n2:17:54.660 --> 2:17:57.220\n not impossible, but much more difficult to do it alone.\n\n2:17:58.260 --> 2:18:02.900\n If we were to take the journey, especially in the software world where there's not significant\n\n2:18:02.900 --> 2:18:10.260\n investment required for it to build something up, is it possible to go to a prototype to\n\n2:18:10.260 --> 2:18:14.260\n something that essentially works and already has a huge number of customers alone?\n\n2:18:14.820 --> 2:18:15.140\n Sure.\n\n2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:20.740\n There are lots and lots of loan founder companies out there that have made an incredible difference.\n\n2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:25.780\n I mean, I'm not certainly putting rhapsody in the league of Spotify.\n\n2:18:25.780 --> 2:18:29.620\n We were too early to be Spotify, but we did an awful lot of innovation.\n\n2:18:29.620 --> 2:18:33.220\n And then after the company sold and ended up in the hands of real networks and MTV,\n\n2:18:33.780 --> 2:18:35.700\n you know, got to millions of subs, right?\n\n2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:40.580\n I was a loan founder and I studied Arabic and Middle Eastern history undergrad,\n\n2:18:40.580 --> 2:18:42.340\n so I definitely wasn't very, very technical.\n\n2:18:42.340 --> 2:18:44.820\n But yeah, loan founders can absolutely work.\n\n2:18:44.820 --> 2:18:51.140\n And the advantage of a loan founder is you don't have the catastrophic potential\n\n2:18:51.140 --> 2:18:53.060\n of a falling out between founders.\n\n2:18:53.060 --> 2:19:00.100\n I mean, two founders who fall out with each other badly can rip a company to shreds because\n\n2:19:00.100 --> 2:19:04.260\n they both have an enormous amount of equity and enormous amount of power.\n\n2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:06.580\n And the capital structure is a result of that.\n\n2:19:06.580 --> 2:19:12.420\n They both have an enormous amount of moral authority with the team as a result of each\n\n2:19:12.420 --> 2:19:13.620\n having that founder role.\n\n2:19:14.260 --> 2:19:21.220\n And I have witnessed over the years many, many situations in which companies have been shredded\n\n2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:27.380\n or have suffered near fatal blows because of a falling out between founders.\n\n2:19:27.380 --> 2:19:30.420\n And the more founders you add, the more risky that becomes.\n\n2:19:30.420 --> 2:19:36.100\n I don't think there should ever almost, I mean, you never say never, but multiple founders\n\n2:19:36.100 --> 2:19:44.180\n beyond two is such an unstable and potentially treacherous situation that I would never,\n\n2:19:44.180 --> 2:19:45.940\n ever recommend going beyond two.\n\n2:19:45.940 --> 2:19:51.540\n But I do see value in the non technical sort of business and market and outside minded\n\n2:19:51.540 --> 2:19:54.100\n founder teaming up with the technical founder.\n\n2:19:54.900 --> 2:19:58.740\n There is a lot of merit to that, but there's a lot of danger in that less those two blow\n\n2:19:58.740 --> 2:19:59.220\n apart.\n\n2:19:59.220 --> 2:20:00.820\n Was it lonely for you?\n\n2:20:00.820 --> 2:20:01.700\n Unbelievably.\n\n2:20:01.700 --> 2:20:02.820\n And that's the drawback.\n\n2:20:02.820 --> 2:20:10.500\n I mean, if you're a lone founder, there is no other person that you can sit down with\n\n2:20:10.500 --> 2:20:15.620\n and tackle problems and talk them through who has precisely or nearly precisely your\n\n2:20:15.620 --> 2:20:16.740\n alignment of interests.\n\n2:20:17.460 --> 2:20:23.300\n Your most trusted board member is likely an investor and therefore at the end of the\n\n2:20:23.300 --> 2:20:26.900\n day has the interest of preferred stock in mind, not common stock.\n\n2:20:26.900 --> 2:20:33.860\n Your most trusted VP, who might own a very significant stake in the company, doesn't\n\n2:20:33.860 --> 2:20:35.860\n own anywhere near your stake in the company.\n\n2:20:35.860 --> 2:20:40.900\n And so their long term interests may well be in getting the right level of experience\n\n2:20:40.900 --> 2:20:44.180\n and credibility necessary to peel off and start their own company.\n\n2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:51.380\n Or their interests might be aligned with jumping ship and setting up with a different\n\n2:20:51.380 --> 2:20:54.500\n company, whether it's a rival or one in a completely different space.\n\n2:20:54.500 --> 2:20:57.780\n So, yeah, being a lone founder is a spectacularly lonely thing.\n\n2:20:57.780 --> 2:20:59.220\n And that's a major downside to it.\n\n2:20:59.220 --> 2:21:00.180\n What about mentorship?\n\n2:21:00.180 --> 2:21:01.780\n Because you're a mentor to a lot of people.\n\n2:21:03.380 --> 2:21:09.220\n Can you find an alleviation to that loneliness in the space of ideas with a good mentor?\n\n2:21:09.220 --> 2:21:11.620\n With a good mentor or like a mentor who's mentoring you?\n\n2:21:11.620 --> 2:21:12.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:12.100 --> 2:21:15.620\n Yeah, you can a great deal, particularly if it's somebody who's been through this very\n\n2:21:15.620 --> 2:21:21.860\n process and has navigated it successfully and cares enough about you and your well being\n\n2:21:21.860 --> 2:21:25.060\n to give you beautifully unvarnished advice.\n\n2:21:25.060 --> 2:21:26.740\n That can be a huge, huge thing.\n\n2:21:26.740 --> 2:21:28.180\n That can assuage things a great deal.\n\n2:21:28.900 --> 2:21:35.300\n And I had a board member who was not an investor, who basically played that role for me to a\n\n2:21:35.300 --> 2:21:35.940\n great degree.\n\n2:21:35.940 --> 2:21:39.060\n He came in maybe halfway through the company's history, though.\n\n2:21:39.060 --> 2:21:41.700\n I would have needed that the most in the very earliest days.\n\n2:21:43.460 --> 2:21:47.780\n Yeah, the loneliness, that's the whole journey of life.\n\n2:21:47.780 --> 2:21:49.620\n We're always alone, alone together.\n\n2:21:49.620 --> 2:21:50.260\n Mm hmm.\n\n2:21:51.300 --> 2:21:52.500\n It pays to embrace that.\n\n2:21:54.180 --> 2:21:58.740\n You were saying that there might be something outside of the founder that's also that you\n\n2:21:58.740 --> 2:22:00.500\n were promising to be brief on.\n\n2:22:00.500 --> 2:22:00.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:00.820 --> 2:22:02.820\n OK, so we talked about the founder.\n\n2:22:02.820 --> 2:22:04.500\n You were asking what makes a great startup.\n\n2:22:04.500 --> 2:22:04.820\n Yes.\n\n2:22:04.820 --> 2:22:09.140\n And great founder is thing number one, but then thing number two, and it's ginormous,\n\n2:22:09.140 --> 2:22:09.860\n is a great team.\n\n2:22:10.420 --> 2:22:16.660\n And so I said so much about the founder because one hopes or one believes that a founder who\n\n2:22:16.660 --> 2:22:22.020\n is a great hirer is going to be hiring people and in charge of critical functions like\n\n2:22:22.020 --> 2:22:25.860\n engineering and marketing and biz dev and sales and so forth, who themselves are great\n\n2:22:25.860 --> 2:22:26.740\n hirers.\n\n2:22:26.740 --> 2:22:30.820\n But what needs to radiate from the founder into the team that might be a little bit different\n\n2:22:30.820 --> 2:22:32.820\n from what's in the gene code of the founder?\n\n2:22:33.380 --> 2:22:40.580\n The team needs to be fully bought in to the, you know, the intuitions and the vision of\n\n2:22:40.580 --> 2:22:41.220\n the founder.\n\n2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:41.540\n Great.\n\n2:22:41.540 --> 2:22:42.260\n We've got that.\n\n2:22:42.260 --> 2:22:50.020\n But the team needs to have a slightly different thing, which is, you know, it's 99% obsession\n\n2:22:50.740 --> 2:22:57.540\n is execution, is to relentlessly hit the milestones, hit the objectives, hit the quarterly\n\n2:22:57.540 --> 2:22:58.020\n goals.\n\n2:22:58.500 --> 2:23:00.820\n That is, you know, 1% vision.\n\n2:23:00.820 --> 2:23:02.900\n You don't want to lose that.\n\n2:23:02.900 --> 2:23:10.020\n But execution machines, you know, people who have a demonstrated ability and a demonstrated\n\n2:23:10.020 --> 2:23:14.100\n focus on, yeah, I go from point to point to point.\n\n2:23:14.100 --> 2:23:20.500\n I try to beat and raise expectations relentlessly, never fall short, and, you know, both sort\n\n2:23:20.500 --> 2:23:22.660\n of blaze and follow the path.\n\n2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:25.940\n Not that the path is going to, I mean, blaze the trail as well.\n\n2:23:25.940 --> 2:23:31.780\n I mean, a good founder is going to trust that VP of sales to have a better sense of what\n\n2:23:31.780 --> 2:23:34.820\n it takes to build out that organization, what the milestones be.\n\n2:23:34.820 --> 2:23:38.100\n And it's going to be kind of a dialogue amongst those at the top.\n\n2:23:38.100 --> 2:23:42.260\n But, you know, execution obsession in the team is the next thing.\n\n2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:47.140\n Yeah, there's some sense where the founder, you know, you talk about sort of the space\n\n2:23:47.140 --> 2:23:51.780\n of ideas, like first principles thinking, asking big difficult questions of like future\n\n2:23:51.780 --> 2:23:55.940\n trajectories or having a big vision and big picture dreams.\n\n2:23:55.940 --> 2:24:03.140\n You can almost be a dreamer, it feels like, when you're like not the founder, but in the\n\n2:24:03.140 --> 2:24:08.260\n space of sort of leadership.\n\n2:24:08.260 --> 2:24:12.980\n But when it gets to the ground floor, there has to be execution, there has to be hitting\n\n2:24:12.980 --> 2:24:15.220\n deadlines.\n\n2:24:15.220 --> 2:24:18.100\n And sometimes those are attention.\n\n2:24:18.100 --> 2:24:28.340\n There's something about dreams that are attention with the pragmatic nature of execution.\n\n2:24:28.340 --> 2:24:32.100\n Not dreams, but sort of ambitious vision.\n\n2:24:32.100 --> 2:24:35.780\n And those have to be, I suppose, coupled.\n\n2:24:35.780 --> 2:24:42.900\n The vision in the leader and the execution in the software world, that would be the programmer\n\n2:24:42.900 --> 2:24:45.060\n or the designer.\n\n2:24:45.060 --> 2:24:46.460\n Absolutely.\n\n2:24:46.460 --> 2:24:51.740\n Amongst many other things, you're an incredible conversationalist, a podcast, you host a podcast\n\n2:24:51.740 --> 2:24:52.740\n called After On.\n\n2:24:52.740 --> 2:24:58.700\n I mean, there's a million questions I want to ask you here, but one at the highest level,\n\n2:24:58.700 --> 2:25:00.660\n what do you think makes for a great conversation?\n\n2:25:00.660 --> 2:25:07.100\n I would say two things, one of two things, and ideally both of two things.\n\n2:25:07.100 --> 2:25:16.280\n One is if something is beautifully architected, whether it's done deliberately and methodically\n\n2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:21.820\n and willfully, as when I do it, or whether that just emerges from the conversation.\n\n2:25:21.820 --> 2:25:26.260\n But something that's beautifully architected, that can create something that's incredibly\n\n2:25:26.260 --> 2:25:32.420\n powerful and memorable, or something where there's just extraordinary chemistry.\n\n2:25:32.420 --> 2:25:35.180\n And so with All In, or I'll go way back.\n\n2:25:35.180 --> 2:25:41.140\n You might remember the NPR show Car Talk, I couldn't care less about auto mechanics\n\n2:25:41.140 --> 2:25:42.140\n myself.\n\n2:25:42.140 --> 2:25:43.140\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n2:25:43.140 --> 2:25:47.940\n But I love that show because the banter between those two guys was just beyond, it was without\n\n2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:50.100\n any parallel, right?\n\n2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:54.940\n And some kind of edgy podcasts like Red Scare is just really entertaining to me because\n\n2:25:54.940 --> 2:25:58.940\n the banter between the women on that show is just so good, and All In and that kind\n\n2:25:58.940 --> 2:25:59.940\n of thing.\n\n2:25:59.940 --> 2:26:04.860\n So I think it's a combination of sort of the arc and the chemistry.\n\n2:26:04.860 --> 2:26:11.460\n And I think because the arc can be so important, that's why very, very highly produced podcasts\n\n2:26:11.460 --> 2:26:15.580\n like This American Life, obviously a radio show, but I think of a podcast because that's\n\n2:26:15.580 --> 2:26:21.680\n how I always consume it, or Criminal, or a lot of what Wondery does and so forth.\n\n2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:26.480\n That is real documentary making, and that requires a big team and a big budget relative\n\n2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:31.340\n to the kinds of things you and I do, but nonetheless, then you got that arc, and that can be really,\n\n2:26:31.340 --> 2:26:32.340\n really compelling.\n\n2:26:32.340 --> 2:26:37.660\n But if we go back to conversation, I think it's a combination of structure and chemistry.\n\n2:26:37.660 --> 2:26:43.860\n Yeah, and I've actually personally have lost, I used to love This American Life, and for\n\n2:26:43.860 --> 2:26:51.300\n some reason because it lacks the possibility of magic, it's engineered magic.\n\n2:26:51.300 --> 2:26:53.020\n I've fallen off of it myself as well.\n\n2:26:53.020 --> 2:26:58.340\n I mean, when I fell madly in love with it during the aughts, it was the only thing going.\n\n2:26:58.340 --> 2:27:04.380\n They were really smart to adopt podcasting as a distribution mechanism early.\n\n2:27:04.380 --> 2:27:09.300\n But yeah, I think that maybe there's a little bit less magic there now because I think they\n\n2:27:09.300 --> 2:27:14.140\n have agendas other than necessarily just delighting their listeners with quirky stories, which\n\n2:27:14.140 --> 2:27:17.700\n I think is what it was all about back in the day and some other things.\n\n2:27:17.700 --> 2:27:22.380\n Is there like a memorable conversation that you've had on the podcast, whether it was\n\n2:27:22.380 --> 2:27:29.420\n because it was wild and fun or one that was exceptionally challenging, maybe challenging\n\n2:27:29.420 --> 2:27:31.380\n to prepare for, that kind of thing?\n\n2:27:31.380 --> 2:27:35.660\n Is there something that stands out in your mind that you can draw an insight from?\n\n2:27:35.660 --> 2:27:42.220\n Yeah, I mean, this no way diminishes the episodes that will not be the answer to these two questions,\n\n2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:46.900\n but an example of something that was really, really challenging to prepare for was George\n\n2:27:46.900 --> 2:27:48.040\n Church.\n\n2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:52.380\n So as I'm sure you know and as I'm sure many of your listeners know, he is one of the absolute\n\n2:27:52.380 --> 2:27:55.060\n leading lights in the field of synthetic biology.\n\n2:27:55.060 --> 2:27:57.460\n He's also unbelievably prolific.\n\n2:27:57.460 --> 2:28:02.640\n His lab is large and has all kinds of efforts have spun out of that.\n\n2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:08.140\n And what I wanted to make my George Church episode about was, first of all, grounding\n\n2:28:08.140 --> 2:28:12.460\n people into what is this thing called Symbio.\n\n2:28:12.460 --> 2:28:17.380\n And that required me to learn a hell of a lot more about Symbio than I knew going into\n\n2:28:17.380 --> 2:28:18.380\n it.\n\n2:28:18.380 --> 2:28:23.140\n So there was just this very broad, I mean, I knew much more than the average person going\n\n2:28:23.140 --> 2:28:27.140\n into that episode, but there was this incredible breadth of grounding that I needed to get\n\n2:28:27.140 --> 2:28:29.300\n myself in the domain.\n\n2:28:29.300 --> 2:28:34.100\n And then George does so many interesting things, there's so many interesting things emitting\n\n2:28:34.100 --> 2:28:38.780\n from his lab that, you know, and he and I had a really good dialogue, he was a great\n\n2:28:38.780 --> 2:28:41.340\n guide going into it.\n\n2:28:41.340 --> 2:28:47.420\n Minnowing it down to the three to four that I really wanted us to focus on to create a\n\n2:28:47.420 --> 2:28:51.940\n sense of wonder and magic in the listener of what could be possible from this very broad\n\n2:28:51.940 --> 2:28:54.700\n spectrum domain, that was a doozy of a challenge.\n\n2:28:54.700 --> 2:28:57.860\n That was a tough, tough, tough one to prepare for.\n\n2:28:57.860 --> 2:29:04.940\n Now, in terms of something that was just wild and fun, unexpected, I mean, by the time we\n\n2:29:04.940 --> 2:29:07.400\n sat down to interview, I knew where we were going to go.\n\n2:29:07.400 --> 2:29:15.180\n But just in terms of the idea space, Don Hoffman, yeah, so Don Hoffman is, again, some listeners\n\n2:29:15.180 --> 2:29:19.280\n probably know because he's, I think I was the first podcaster to interview him.\n\n2:29:19.280 --> 2:29:25.060\n I'm sure some of your listeners are familiar with him, but he has this unbelievably contrarian\n\n2:29:25.060 --> 2:29:33.980\n take on the nature of reality, but it is contrarian in a way that all the ideas are highly internally\n\n2:29:33.980 --> 2:29:38.820\n consistent and snap together in a way that's just delightful.\n\n2:29:38.820 --> 2:29:46.080\n And it seems as radically violating of our intuitions and as radically violating of the\n\n2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:49.500\n probable nature of reality as anything that one can encounter.\n\n2:29:49.500 --> 2:29:54.900\n But an analogy that he uses, which is very powerful, which is what intuition could possibly\n\n2:29:54.900 --> 2:30:00.760\n be more powerful than the notion that there is a single unitary direction called down.\n\n2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:05.260\n When we're on this big flat thing for which there is a thing called down.\n\n2:30:05.260 --> 2:30:10.340\n And we all know, I mean, that's the most intuitive thing that one could probably think of.\n\n2:30:10.340 --> 2:30:12.420\n And we all know that that ain't true.\n\n2:30:12.420 --> 2:30:18.980\n So my conversation with Don Hoffman was just wild and full of plot twists and interesting\n\n2:30:18.980 --> 2:30:19.980\n stuff.\n\n2:30:19.980 --> 2:30:25.220\n And the interesting thing about the wildness of his ideas, it's to me at least as a listener,\n\n2:30:25.220 --> 2:30:35.020\n coupled with, he's a good listener and he empathizes with the people who challenge his\n\n2:30:35.020 --> 2:30:36.020\n ideas.\n\n2:30:36.020 --> 2:30:39.580\n Like what's a better way to phrase that?\n\n2:30:39.580 --> 2:30:44.580\n He is a welcoming of challenge in a way that creates a really fun conversation.\n\n2:30:44.580 --> 2:30:45.580\n Oh, totally.\n\n2:30:45.580 --> 2:30:46.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:52.900\n He loves a parry or a jab, whatever the word is at his argument.\n\n2:30:52.900 --> 2:30:54.020\n He honors it.\n\n2:30:54.020 --> 2:31:03.700\n He's a very, very gentle and noncombatative soul, but then he is very good and takes great\n\n2:31:03.700 --> 2:31:10.220\n evident joy in responding to that in a way that expands your understanding of his thinking.\n\n2:31:10.220 --> 2:31:15.380\n Let me as a small tangent of tying up together our previous conversation about listening.com\n\n2:31:15.380 --> 2:31:20.720\n and streaming and Spotify and the world of podcasting.\n\n2:31:20.720 --> 2:31:25.580\n So we've been talking about this magical medium of podcasting.\n\n2:31:25.580 --> 2:31:32.840\n I have a lot of friends at Spotify in the high positions of Spotify as well.\n\n2:31:32.840 --> 2:31:41.500\n I worry about Spotify and podcasting and the future of podcasting in general that moves\n\n2:31:41.500 --> 2:31:49.400\n podcasting in the place of maybe walled gardens of sorts.\n\n2:31:49.400 --> 2:31:55.300\n Since you've had a foot in both worlds, have a foot in both worlds, do you worry as well\n\n2:31:55.300 --> 2:31:56.860\n about the future of podcasting?\n\n2:31:56.860 --> 2:31:57.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:57.860 --> 2:32:05.660\n I think walled gardens are really toxic to the medium that they start balkanizing.\n\n2:32:05.660 --> 2:32:09.500\n So to take an example, I'll take two examples.\n\n2:32:09.500 --> 2:32:15.620\n With music, it was a very, very big deal that at Rhapsody we were the first company to get\n\n2:32:15.620 --> 2:32:20.620\n full catalog licenses from all back then there were five major music labels and also hundreds\n\n2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:25.040\n and hundreds of indies because you needed to present the listener with a sense that\n\n2:32:25.040 --> 2:32:31.220\n basically everything is there and there is essentially no friction to discovering that\n\n2:32:31.220 --> 2:32:36.860\n which is new and you can wander this realm and all you really need is a good map, whether\n\n2:32:36.860 --> 2:32:41.020\n it is something that somebody, the editorial team assembled or a good algorithm or whatever\n\n2:32:41.020 --> 2:32:43.580\n it is, but a good map to wander this domain.\n\n2:32:43.580 --> 2:32:50.500\n When you start walling things off, A, you undermine the joy of friction free discovery,\n\n2:32:50.500 --> 2:32:55.620\n which is an incredibly valuable thing to deliver to your customer, both from a business standpoint\n\n2:32:55.620 --> 2:33:01.380\n and simply from a humanistic standpoint of do you want to bring delight to people?\n\n2:33:01.380 --> 2:33:06.080\n But it also creates an incredible opening vector for piracy.\n\n2:33:06.080 --> 2:33:10.700\n And so something that's very different from the Rhapsody slash Spotify slash et cetera\n\n2:33:10.700 --> 2:33:14.580\n like experience is what we have now in video.\n\n2:33:14.580 --> 2:33:20.180\n Like wow, is that show on Hulu, is it on Netflix, is it on something like IFC channel, is it\n\n2:33:20.180 --> 2:33:23.580\n on Discovery Plus, is it here, is it there?\n\n2:33:23.580 --> 2:33:30.740\n And the more frustration and toe stubbing that people encounter when they are seeking\n\n2:33:30.740 --> 2:33:35.740\n something and they're already paying a very respectable amount of money per month to have\n\n2:33:35.740 --> 2:33:39.860\n access to content and they can't find it, the more that happens, the more people are\n\n2:33:39.860 --> 2:33:43.060\n going to be driven to piracy solutions like to hell with it.\n\n2:33:43.060 --> 2:33:45.900\n Never know where I'm going to find something, I never know what it's going to cost.\n\n2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:50.180\n Oftentimes really interesting things are simply unavailable.\n\n2:33:50.180 --> 2:33:53.260\n That surprises me the number of times that I've been looking for things I don't even\n\n2:33:53.260 --> 2:33:59.940\n think are that obscure that are just, it says not available in your geography, period, mister.\n\n2:33:59.940 --> 2:34:01.660\n So I think that that's a mistake.\n\n2:34:01.660 --> 2:34:07.780\n And then the other thing is for podcasters and lovers of podcasting, we should want to\n\n2:34:07.780 --> 2:34:16.980\n resist this walled garden thing because A, it does smother this friction free or eradicate\n\n2:34:16.980 --> 2:34:21.780\n this friction free discovery unless you want to sign up for lots of different services.\n\n2:34:21.780 --> 2:34:28.580\n And also dims the voice of somebody who might be able to have a far, far, far bigger impact\n\n2:34:28.580 --> 2:34:32.580\n by reaching far more neurons with their ideas.\n\n2:34:32.580 --> 2:34:36.140\n I'm going to use an example from I guess it was probably the 90s or maybe it was the\n\n2:34:36.140 --> 2:34:42.740\n aughts of Howard Stern, who had the biggest megaphone or maybe the second biggest after\n\n2:34:42.740 --> 2:34:46.300\n Oprah megaphone in popular culture.\n\n2:34:46.300 --> 2:34:50.020\n And because he was syndicated on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of radio stations\n\n2:34:50.020 --> 2:34:53.460\n at a time when terrestrial broadcast was the main thing people listened to in their car,\n\n2:34:53.460 --> 2:34:54.940\n no more obviously.\n\n2:34:54.940 --> 2:34:59.780\n But when he decided to go over to satellite radio, I can't remember if it was XM or Sirius,\n\n2:34:59.780 --> 2:35:01.820\n maybe they'd already merged at that point.\n\n2:35:01.820 --> 2:35:07.660\n But when he did that, he made, you know, totally his right to do it, a financial calculation\n\n2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:11.100\n that they were offering him a nine figure sum to do that.\n\n2:35:11.100 --> 2:35:14.740\n But his audience, because not a lot of people were subscribing to satellite radio at that\n\n2:35:14.740 --> 2:35:19.220\n point, his audience probably collapsed by, I wouldn't be surprised if it was as much\n\n2:35:19.220 --> 2:35:20.960\n as 95%.\n\n2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:27.480\n And so the influence that he had on the culture and his ability to sort of shape conversation\n\n2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:30.580\n and so forth just got muted.\n\n2:35:30.580 --> 2:35:37.340\n Yeah, and also there's a certain sense, especially in modern times, where the walled gardens\n\n2:35:37.340 --> 2:35:48.460\n naturally lead to, I don't know if there's a term for it, but people who are not creatives\n\n2:35:48.460 --> 2:35:51.580\n starting to have power over the creatives.\n\n2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:52.580\n Right.\n\n2:35:52.580 --> 2:35:58.640\n And even if they don't stifle it, if they're providing, you know, incentives within the\n\n2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:06.340\n platform to shape, shift, or, you know, even completely mutate or distort the show, I mean,\n\n2:36:06.340 --> 2:36:12.100\n imagine somebody has got, you know, a reasonably interesting idea for a podcast and they get\n\n2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:15.940\n signed up with, let's say Spotify, and Spotify is going to give them financing to get the\n\n2:36:15.940 --> 2:36:17.700\n thing spun up.\n\n2:36:17.700 --> 2:36:18.700\n And that's great.\n\n2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:23.920\n And Spotify is going to give them a certain amount of really, you know, powerful placement,\n\n2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:27.440\n you know, within the visual field of listeners.\n\n2:36:27.440 --> 2:36:29.140\n But Spotify has conditions for that.\n\n2:36:29.140 --> 2:36:34.820\n They say, look, you know, we think that your podcast will be much more successful if you\n\n2:36:34.820 --> 2:36:37.940\n dumb it down about 60%.\n\n2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:44.220\n If you add some, you know, silly, dirty jokes, if you do this, you do that.\n\n2:36:44.220 --> 2:36:48.840\n And suddenly the person who is dependent upon Spotify for permission to come into existence\n\n2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:52.780\n and is really dependent, really wants to please them, you know, to get that money in, to get\n\n2:36:52.780 --> 2:36:55.100\n that placement, really wants to be successful.\n\n2:36:55.100 --> 2:37:00.780\n And all of a sudden you're having a dialogue between a complete non creative, some marketing,\n\n2:37:00.780 --> 2:37:05.420\n you know, sort of data analytic person at Spotify and a creative that's going to shape\n\n2:37:05.420 --> 2:37:10.480\n what that show is, you know, so that could be much more common.\n\n2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:16.220\n And ultimately having the aggregate, an even bigger impact than, you know, the cancellation,\n\n2:37:16.220 --> 2:37:20.100\n let's say if somebody who says the wrong word or voices the wrong idea, I mean, that's kind\n\n2:37:20.100 --> 2:37:25.860\n of what you have, not kind of, that's what you have with film and TV is that so much\n\n2:37:25.860 --> 2:37:31.100\n influence is exerted over the storyline and the plots and the character arcs and all kinds\n\n2:37:31.100 --> 2:37:35.900\n of things by executives who are completely alien to the experience and the skill set\n\n2:37:35.900 --> 2:37:40.180\n of being a show runner in television, being a director in film that, you know, is meant\n\n2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:43.860\n to like, oh, we can't piss off the Chinese market here or we can't say that or we need\n\n2:37:43.860 --> 2:37:48.880\n to have, you know, cast members that have precisely these demographics reflected or\n\n2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:54.100\n whatever it is that, you know, and obviously despite that extraordinary, at least TV shows\n\n2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:59.980\n are now being made, um, you know, in terms of film, I think the quality has, has nosedived\n\n2:37:59.980 --> 2:38:03.380\n of the average, let's say, say American film coming out of a major studio.\n\n2:38:03.380 --> 2:38:07.640\n The average quality and my view has nosedived over the past decade as it's kind of, everything's\n\n2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:13.260\n gotta be a superhero franchise, but you know, great stuff gets made despite that.\n\n2:38:13.260 --> 2:38:19.920\n But I have to assume that in some cases, at least in perhaps many cases, greater stuff\n\n2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:23.660\n would be made if there was less interference from non creative executives.\n\n2:38:23.660 --> 2:38:27.420\n It's like the flip side of that though, and this is, was the pitch of Spotify because\n\n2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:34.260\n I've heard their pitch is Netflix from everybody I've heard that I've spoken with about Netflix\n\n2:38:34.260 --> 2:38:36.020\n is they actually empower the creator.\n\n2:38:36.020 --> 2:38:41.100\n I don't know what the heck they do, but they do a good job of giving creators, even the\n\n2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:46.100\n crazy ones like Tim Dillon, like Joe Rogan, like comedians, freedom to be their crazy\n\n2:38:46.100 --> 2:38:47.300\n selves.\n\n2:38:47.300 --> 2:38:54.120\n And the result is like some of the greatest television, some of the greatest cinema, whatever\n\n2:38:54.120 --> 2:38:55.860\n you call it, ever made.\n\n2:38:55.860 --> 2:38:56.860\n True.\n\n2:38:56.860 --> 2:38:57.860\n Right.\n\n2:38:57.860 --> 2:38:58.860\n And I don't know what the heck they're doing.\n\n2:38:58.860 --> 2:38:59.860\n It's a relative thing.\n\n2:38:59.860 --> 2:39:00.860\n It's not able from what I understand.\n\n2:39:00.860 --> 2:39:01.860\n It's a relative thing.\n\n2:39:01.860 --> 2:39:07.900\n They're interfering far, far, far less than, you know, NBC or, you know, AMC would have\n\n2:39:07.900 --> 2:39:08.900\n interfered.\n\n2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:12.420\n It's a relative thing, and obviously they're the ones writing the checks and they're the\n\n2:39:12.420 --> 2:39:13.420\n ones giving the platforms.\n\n2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:16.660\n They've every right to their own influence, obviously.\n\n2:39:16.660 --> 2:39:21.780\n But my understanding is that they're relatively way more hands off and that has had a demonstrable\n\n2:39:21.780 --> 2:39:23.300\n effect because I agree.\n\n2:39:23.300 --> 2:39:29.220\n Some of the greatest, you know, video produced video content of all time, an incredibly inordinate\n\n2:39:29.220 --> 2:39:32.900\n percentage of that is coming out from Netflix in just a few years when the history of cinema\n\n2:39:32.900 --> 2:39:34.740\n goes back many, many decades.\n\n2:39:34.740 --> 2:39:41.500\n And Spotify wants to be that for podcasting, and I hope they do become that for podcasting,\n\n2:39:41.500 --> 2:39:47.700\n but I'm wearing my skeptical goggles or skeptical hat, whatever the heck it is, because it's\n\n2:39:47.700 --> 2:39:55.100\n not easy to do and it requires, it requires letting go of power, giving power to the creatives.\n\n2:39:55.100 --> 2:40:01.180\n It requires pivoting, which large companies, even as innovative as Spotify is, still now\n\n2:40:01.180 --> 2:40:05.580\n a large company, pivoting into a whole new space is very tricky and difficult.\n\n2:40:05.580 --> 2:40:08.300\n So I'm skeptical, but hopeful.\n\n2:40:08.300 --> 2:40:13.060\n What advice would you give to a young person today about life, about career?\n\n2:40:13.060 --> 2:40:18.980\n We talked about startups, we talked about music, we talked about the end of human civilization.\n\n2:40:18.980 --> 2:40:23.660\n Is there advice you would give to a young person today, maybe in college, maybe in high\n\n2:40:23.660 --> 2:40:27.140\n school about their life?\n\n2:40:27.140 --> 2:40:34.340\n Let's see, there's so many domains you can advise on, and I'm not going to give advice\n\n2:40:34.340 --> 2:40:40.120\n on life because I fear that I would drift into hallmark bromides that really wouldn't\n\n2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:43.540\n be all that distinctive, and they might be entirely true.\n\n2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:48.320\n Sometimes the greatest insights about life turn out to be the kinds of things you'd see\n\n2:40:48.320 --> 2:40:50.540\n on a hallmark card, so I'm going to steer clear of that.\n\n2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:57.900\n On a career level, one thing that I think is unintuitive but unbelievably powerful is\n\n2:40:57.900 --> 2:41:07.420\n to focus not necessarily on being in the top sliver of 1% in excelling at one domain that's\n\n2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:14.140\n important and valuable, but to think in terms of intersections of two domains, which are\n\n2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:19.620\n rare but valuable, and there's a couple reasons for this.\n\n2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:25.020\n The first is in an incredibly competitive world that is so much more competitive than\n\n2:41:25.020 --> 2:41:28.900\n it was when I was coming out of school, radically more competitive than when I was coming out\n\n2:41:28.900 --> 2:41:34.060\n of school, to navigate your way to the absolute pinnacle of any domain.\n\n2:41:34.060 --> 2:41:40.340\n Let's say you want to be really, really great at Python, pick a language, whatever it is.\n\n2:41:40.340 --> 2:41:44.940\n You want to be one of the world's greatest Python developers, JavaScript, whatever your\n\n2:41:44.940 --> 2:41:45.940\n language is.\n\n2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:46.940\n Hopefully it's not Cobalt.\n\n2:41:46.940 --> 2:41:53.980\n By the way, if you listen to this, I am actually looking for a Cobalt expert to interview because\n\n2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:58.140\n I find the language fascinating, and there's not many of them, so please, if you know a\n\n2:41:58.140 --> 2:42:02.380\n world expert in Cobalt or Fortran, both, actually.\n\n2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:03.580\n Or if you are one.\n\n2:42:03.580 --> 2:42:05.660\n Or if you are one, please email me.\n\n2:42:05.660 --> 2:42:06.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:06.660 --> 2:42:10.620\n So, I mean, if you're going out there and you want to be in the top sliver 1% of Python\n\n2:42:10.620 --> 2:42:13.180\n developers, it's a very, very difficult thing to do, particularly if you want to be number\n\n2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:14.940\n one in the world, something like that.\n\n2:42:14.940 --> 2:42:23.020\n And I'll use an analogy as I had a friend in college who was on a track and indeed succeeded\n\n2:42:23.020 --> 2:42:29.300\n at that to become an Olympic medalist, and I think it was 100 meter breaststroke.\n\n2:42:29.300 --> 2:42:37.540\n And he mortgaged a significant percentage of his college life to that goal, or I should\n\n2:42:37.540 --> 2:42:39.980\n say dedicated or invested or whatever you wanted to say.\n\n2:42:39.980 --> 2:42:44.260\n But he didn't participate in a lot of the social, a lot of the late night, a lot of\n\n2:42:44.260 --> 2:42:48.180\n the this, a lot of the that, because he was training so much.\n\n2:42:48.180 --> 2:42:50.740\n And obviously, he also wanted to keep up with his academics.\n\n2:42:50.740 --> 2:42:55.660\n And at the end of the day, the story has a happy ending in that he did medal in that.\n\n2:42:55.660 --> 2:43:00.020\n Bronze, not gold, but holy cow, anybody who gets an Olympic medal, that's an extraordinary\n\n2:43:00.020 --> 2:43:01.020\n thing.\n\n2:43:01.020 --> 2:43:05.140\n And at that moment, he was one of the top three people on earth at that thing.\n\n2:43:05.140 --> 2:43:07.380\n But wow, how hard to do that.\n\n2:43:07.380 --> 2:43:12.020\n How many thousands of other people went down that path and made similar sacrifices and\n\n2:43:12.020 --> 2:43:13.020\n didn't get there.\n\n2:43:13.020 --> 2:43:14.740\n It's very, very hard to do that.\n\n2:43:14.740 --> 2:43:19.020\n Whereas, and I'll use a personal example.\n\n2:43:19.020 --> 2:43:23.620\n When I came out of business school, I went to a good business school and learned the\n\n2:43:23.620 --> 2:43:25.780\n things that were there to be learned.\n\n2:43:25.780 --> 2:43:29.340\n And I came out and I entered a world with lots of MBAs.\n\n2:43:29.340 --> 2:43:30.500\n Harvard Business School, by the way.\n\n2:43:30.500 --> 2:43:32.980\n Okay, yes, it was Harvard, it's true.\n\n2:43:32.980 --> 2:43:36.860\n You're the first person who went there who didn't say where you went, which is beautiful.\n\n2:43:36.860 --> 2:43:37.860\n I appreciate that.\n\n2:43:37.860 --> 2:43:41.620\n It's one of the greatest business schools in the world.\n\n2:43:41.620 --> 2:43:44.420\n It's a whole nother fascinating conversation about that world.\n\n2:43:44.420 --> 2:43:45.420\n But anyway, yes.\n\n2:43:45.420 --> 2:43:51.180\n But anyway, so I learned the things that you learn getting an MBA from a top program.\n\n2:43:51.180 --> 2:43:56.620\n And I entered a world that had hundreds of thousands of people who had MBAs, probably\n\n2:43:56.620 --> 2:44:00.340\n hundreds of thousands who have them from top 10 programs.\n\n2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:04.900\n So I was not particularly great at being an MBA person.\n\n2:44:04.900 --> 2:44:09.420\n I was inexperienced relative to most of them and there were a lot of them, but it was okay\n\n2:44:09.420 --> 2:44:12.980\n MBA person, right, newly minted.\n\n2:44:12.980 --> 2:44:20.380\n But then as it happened, I found my way into working on the commercial internet in 1994.\n\n2:44:20.380 --> 2:44:25.380\n So I went to a, at the time, giant hot computing company called Silicon Graphics, which had\n\n2:44:25.380 --> 2:44:30.820\n enough heft and enough head count that they could take on and experienced MBAs and try\n\n2:44:30.820 --> 2:44:33.380\n to train them in the world of Silicon Valley.\n\n2:44:33.380 --> 2:44:38.940\n But within that company that had an enormous amount of surface area and was touching a\n\n2:44:38.940 --> 2:44:46.660\n lot of areas and had unbelievably smart people at the time, it was not surprising that SGI\n\n2:44:46.660 --> 2:44:51.340\n started doing really interesting and innovative and trailblazing stuff on the internet before\n\n2:44:51.340 --> 2:44:52.660\n almost anybody else.\n\n2:44:52.660 --> 2:44:55.840\n And part of the reason was that our founder, Jim Clark, went off to cofound Netscape with\n\n2:44:55.840 --> 2:44:56.840\n Mark Andreessen.\n\n2:44:56.840 --> 2:44:58.860\n So the whole company is like, wait, what was that?\n\n2:44:58.860 --> 2:45:00.740\n What's this commercial internet thing?\n\n2:45:00.740 --> 2:45:01.940\n So I ended up in that group.\n\n2:45:01.940 --> 2:45:09.500\n Now in terms of being a commercial internet person or a worldwide web person, again, I\n\n2:45:09.500 --> 2:45:14.420\n was in that case, barely credentialed, I couldn't write a stitch of code, but I had a pretty\n\n2:45:14.420 --> 2:45:22.140\n good mind for grasping the business and cultural significance of this transition.\n\n2:45:22.140 --> 2:45:25.540\n And this was, again, we were talking earlier about emerging areas.\n\n2:45:25.540 --> 2:45:29.540\n Within a few months, you know, I was in the relatively top echelon of people in terms\n\n2:45:29.540 --> 2:45:33.740\n of just sheer experience, because like, let's say it was five months into the program, there\n\n2:45:33.740 --> 2:45:37.140\n were only so many people who'd been doing worldwide web stuff commercially for five\n\n2:45:37.140 --> 2:45:38.620\n months, you know?\n\n2:45:38.620 --> 2:45:43.580\n And then what was interesting though was the intersection of those two things.\n\n2:45:43.580 --> 2:45:49.700\n The commercial web, as it turned out, grew into an unbelievable vastness.\n\n2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:57.480\n And so by being a pretty good, okay web person and a pretty good, okay MBA person, that intersection\n\n2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:03.420\n put me in a very rare group, which was web oriented MBAs.\n\n2:46:03.420 --> 2:46:08.380\n And in those early days, you could probably count on your fingers the number of people\n\n2:46:08.380 --> 2:46:12.140\n who came out of really competitive programs who were doing stuff full time on the internet.\n\n2:46:12.140 --> 2:46:17.480\n And there was a greater appetite for great software developers in the internet domain,\n\n2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:24.300\n but there was an appetite and a real one and a rapidly growing one for MBA thinkers who\n\n2:46:24.300 --> 2:46:29.300\n were also seasoned and networked in the emerging world of the commercial worldwide web.\n\n2:46:29.300 --> 2:46:37.500\n And so finding an intersection of two things you can be pretty good at, but is a rare intersection\n\n2:46:37.500 --> 2:46:43.500\n and a special intersection is probably a much easier way to make yourself distinguishable\n\n2:46:43.500 --> 2:46:48.740\n and in demand from the world than trying to be world class at this one thing.\n\n2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:53.300\n So in the intersection is where there's to be discovered opportunity and success.\n\n2:46:53.300 --> 2:46:54.620\n That's really interesting.\n\n2:46:54.620 --> 2:46:58.100\n There's actually more intersection of fields and fields themselves, right?\n\n2:46:58.100 --> 2:47:02.500\n So yeah, I mean, I'll give you kind of a funny hypothetical here, but it's one I've been\n\n2:47:02.500 --> 2:47:04.580\n thinking about a little bit.\n\n2:47:04.580 --> 2:47:06.580\n There's a lot of people in crypto right now.\n\n2:47:06.580 --> 2:47:11.980\n It'd be hard to be in the top percentile of crypto people, whether it comes from just\n\n2:47:11.980 --> 2:47:15.660\n having a sheer grasp of the industry, a great network within the industry, technological\n\n2:47:15.660 --> 2:47:18.440\n skills, whatever you want to call it.\n\n2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:23.380\n And then there's this parallel world and orthogonal world called crop insurance.\n\n2:47:23.380 --> 2:47:25.420\n And I'm sure that's a big world.\n\n2:47:25.420 --> 2:47:29.540\n Crop insurance is a very, very big deal, particularly in the wealthy and industrialized world where\n\n2:47:29.540 --> 2:47:35.140\n people through sophisticated financial markets, rule of law and large agricultural concerns\n\n2:47:35.140 --> 2:47:37.900\n that are worried about that.\n\n2:47:37.900 --> 2:47:42.780\n Somewhere out there is somebody who is pretty crypto savvy, but probably not top 1%, but\n\n2:47:42.780 --> 2:47:47.600\n also has kind of been in the crop insurance world and understands that a hell of a lot\n\n2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:52.340\n better than almost anybody who's ever had anything to do with cryptocurrency.\n\n2:47:52.340 --> 2:47:58.420\n And so I think that decentralized finance, DeFi, one of the interesting and I think very\n\n2:47:58.420 --> 2:48:03.380\n world positive things that I think it's almost inevitably will be bringing to the world is\n\n2:48:03.380 --> 2:48:06.820\n crop insurance for small holding farmers.\n\n2:48:06.820 --> 2:48:12.180\n I mean, people who have tiny, tiny plots of land in places like India, et cetera, where\n\n2:48:12.180 --> 2:48:17.600\n there is no crop insurance available to them because just the financial infrastructure\n\n2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:19.140\n doesn't exist.\n\n2:48:19.140 --> 2:48:24.980\n But it's highly imaginable that using Oracle networks that are trusted outside deliverers\n\n2:48:24.980 --> 2:48:29.280\n of factual information about rainfall in a particular area, you can start giving drought\n\n2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:31.300\n insurance to folks like this.\n\n2:48:31.300 --> 2:48:37.180\n The right person to come up with that idea is not a crypto whiz who doesn't know a blasted\n\n2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:39.300\n thing about small holding farmers.\n\n2:48:39.300 --> 2:48:43.460\n The right person to come up with that is not a crop insurance whiz who isn't quite sure\n\n2:48:43.460 --> 2:48:47.580\n what Bitcoin is, but somebody occupies that intersection.\n\n2:48:47.580 --> 2:48:52.260\n That's just one of gazillion examples of things that are going to come along for somebody\n\n2:48:52.260 --> 2:48:57.540\n who occupies the right intersection of skills, but isn't necessarily the number one person\n\n2:48:57.540 --> 2:48:59.720\n at either one of those expertises.\n\n2:48:59.720 --> 2:49:05.340\n That's making me kind of wonder about my own little things that I'm average at and seeing\n\n2:49:05.340 --> 2:49:09.340\n where the intersections that could be exploited.\n\n2:49:09.340 --> 2:49:10.420\n That's pretty profound.\n\n2:49:10.420 --> 2:49:15.980\n So we talked quite a bit about the end of the world and how we're both optimistic about\n\n2:49:15.980 --> 2:49:18.260\n us figuring our way out.\n\n2:49:18.260 --> 2:49:27.760\n Unfortunately, for now at least, both you and I are going to die one day, way too soon.\n\n2:49:27.760 --> 2:49:28.760\n First of all, that sucks.\n\n2:49:28.760 --> 2:49:29.760\n It does.\n\n2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:41.460\n I mean, one, I'd like to ask if you ponder your own mortality, how does that kind of,\n\n2:49:41.460 --> 2:49:45.860\n what kind of wisdom inside does it give you about your own life?\n\n2:49:45.860 --> 2:49:50.300\n And broadly, do you think about your life and what the heck it's all about?\n\n2:49:50.300 --> 2:49:57.060\n Yeah, with respect to pondering mortality, I do try to do that as little as possible\n\n2:49:57.060 --> 2:50:00.060\n because there's not a lot I can do about it.\n\n2:50:00.060 --> 2:50:01.060\n But it's inevitably there.\n\n2:50:01.060 --> 2:50:07.000\n And I think that what it does when you think about it in the right way is it makes you\n\n2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:13.940\n realize how unbelievably rare and precious the moments that we have here are, and therefore\n\n2:50:13.940 --> 2:50:18.300\n how consequential the decisions that we make about how to spend our time are.\n\n2:50:18.300 --> 2:50:25.540\n You know, like, do you do those 17 nagging emails or do you have dinner with somebody\n\n2:50:25.540 --> 2:50:28.880\n who's really important to you who haven't seen in three and a half years?\n\n2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:33.780\n If you had an infinite expanse of time in front of you, you might well rationally conclude\n\n2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:37.340\n I'm going to do those emails because collectively they're rather important.\n\n2:50:37.340 --> 2:50:41.160\n And I have tens of thousands of years to catch up with my buddy, Tim.\n\n2:50:41.160 --> 2:50:48.100\n But I think the scarcity of the time that we have helps us choose the right things if\n\n2:50:48.100 --> 2:50:54.160\n we're tuned to that and we're attuned to the context that mortality puts over the consequence\n\n2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:56.980\n of every decision we make of how to spend our time.\n\n2:50:56.980 --> 2:51:00.520\n That doesn't mean that we're all very good at it, it doesn't mean I'm very good at it.\n\n2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:06.380\n But it does add a dimension of choice and significance to everything that we elect to\n\n2:51:06.380 --> 2:51:07.380\n do.\n\n2:51:07.380 --> 2:51:10.500\n It's kind of funny that you say you try to think about it as little as possible.\n\n2:51:10.500 --> 2:51:14.180\n I would venture to say you probably think about the end of human civilization more than\n\n2:51:14.180 --> 2:51:15.580\n you do about your own life.\n\n2:51:15.580 --> 2:51:16.960\n You're probably right.\n\n2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:19.700\n Because that feels like a problem that could be solved.\n\n2:51:19.700 --> 2:51:20.700\n Right.\n\n2:51:20.700 --> 2:51:22.500\n Whereas the end of my own life can't be solved.\n\n2:51:22.500 --> 2:51:23.500\n Well, I don't know.\n\n2:51:23.500 --> 2:51:28.860\n I mean, there's transhumanists who have incredible optimism about near or intermediate future\n\n2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:32.700\n therapies that could really, really change human lifespan.\n\n2:51:32.700 --> 2:51:37.020\n I really hope that they're right, but I don't have a whole lot to add to that project because\n\n2:51:37.020 --> 2:51:39.980\n I'm not a life scientist myself.\n\n2:51:39.980 --> 2:51:44.460\n I'm in part also afraid of immortality.\n\n2:51:44.460 --> 2:51:48.820\n Not as much, but close to as I'm afraid of death itself.\n\n2:51:48.820 --> 2:51:55.220\n So it feels like the things that give us meaning give us meaning because of the scarcity that\n\n2:51:55.220 --> 2:51:56.220\n surrounds it.\n\n2:51:56.220 --> 2:51:57.220\n Agreed.\n\n2:51:57.220 --> 2:52:01.620\n I'm almost afraid of having too much of stuff.\n\n2:52:01.620 --> 2:52:02.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:02.620 --> 2:52:07.940\n Although, if there was something that said, this can expand your enjoyable wellspan or\n\n2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:11.540\n lifespan by 75 years, I'm all in.\n\n2:52:11.540 --> 2:52:19.460\n Well, part of the reason I wanted to not do a startup, really the only thing that worries\n\n2:52:19.460 --> 2:52:24.780\n me about doing a startup is if it becomes successful.\n\n2:52:24.780 --> 2:52:31.540\n Because of how much I dream, how much I'm driven to be successful, that there will not\n\n2:52:31.540 --> 2:52:39.020\n be enough silence in my life, enough scarcity to appreciate the moments I appreciate now\n\n2:52:39.020 --> 2:52:42.380\n as deeply as I appreciate them now.\n\n2:52:42.380 --> 2:52:48.540\n There's a simplicity to my life now that it feels like you might disappear with success.\n\n2:52:48.540 --> 2:52:52.140\n I wouldn't say might.\n\n2:52:52.140 --> 2:52:59.820\n I think if you start a company that has ambitious investors, ambitious for the returns that\n\n2:52:59.820 --> 2:53:05.860\n they'd like to see, that has ambitious employees, ambitious for the career trajectories they\n\n2:53:05.860 --> 2:53:15.020\n want to be on and so forth, and is driven by your own ambition, there's a profound monogamy\n\n2:53:15.020 --> 2:53:18.020\n to that.\n\n2:53:18.020 --> 2:53:24.300\n It is very, very hard to carve out time to be creative, to be peaceful, to be so forth\n\n2:53:24.300 --> 2:53:30.620\n because of with every new employee that you hire, that's one more mouth to feed.\n\n2:53:30.620 --> 2:53:35.260\n With every new investor that you take on, that's one more person to whom you really\n\n2:53:35.260 --> 2:53:38.100\n do want to deliver great returns.\n\n2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:43.580\n As the valuation ticks up, the threshold to delivering great returns for your investors\n\n2:53:43.580 --> 2:53:45.580\n always rises.\n\n2:53:45.580 --> 2:53:54.460\n There is an extraordinary monogamy to being a founder CEO above all for the first few\n\n2:53:54.460 --> 2:53:59.420\n years and first in people's minds could be as many as 10 or 15.\n\n2:53:59.420 --> 2:54:07.600\n But I guess the fundamental calculation is whether the passion for the vision is greater\n\n2:54:07.600 --> 2:54:09.020\n than the cost you'll pay.\n\n2:54:09.020 --> 2:54:10.020\n Right.\n\n2:54:10.020 --> 2:54:11.400\n It's all opportunity cost.\n\n2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:16.620\n It's all opportunity cost in terms of time and attention and experience.\n\n2:54:16.620 --> 2:54:21.100\n And some things like I'm, everyone's different, but I'm less calculating some things you just\n\n2:54:21.100 --> 2:54:22.100\n can't help.\n\n2:54:22.100 --> 2:54:23.100\n Sometimes you just dive in.\n\n2:54:23.100 --> 2:54:24.260\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:54:24.260 --> 2:54:28.180\n I mean you can do balance sheets all you want on this versus that and what's the right.\n\n2:54:28.180 --> 2:54:32.060\n I mean I've done it in the past and it's never worked.\n\n2:54:32.060 --> 2:54:36.780\n It's always been like, okay, what's my gut screaming at me to do?\n\n2:54:36.780 --> 2:54:42.260\n But about the meaning of life, you ever think about that?\n\n2:54:42.260 --> 2:54:43.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:54:43.260 --> 2:54:48.220\n I mean, this is where I'm going to go all hallmarking on you, but I think that there's\n\n2:54:48.220 --> 2:54:57.320\n a few things and one of them is certainly love and the love that we experience and feel\n\n2:54:57.320 --> 2:55:05.700\n and cause to well up in others is something that's just so profound and goes beyond almost\n\n2:55:05.700 --> 2:55:08.260\n anything else that we can do.\n\n2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:13.020\n And whether that is something that lies in the past, like maybe there was somebody that\n\n2:55:13.020 --> 2:55:19.340\n you were dating and loved very profoundly in college and haven't seen in years, I don't\n\n2:55:19.340 --> 2:55:24.380\n think the significance of that love is any way diminished by the fact that it had a notional\n\n2:55:24.380 --> 2:55:25.540\n beginning and end.\n\n2:55:25.540 --> 2:55:30.460\n The fact is that you experience that and you trigger that in somebody else and that happened.\n\n2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:35.260\n And it doesn't have to be, certainly it doesn't have to be love of romantic partners alone.\n\n2:55:35.260 --> 2:55:39.700\n It's family members, it's love between friends, it's love between creatures.\n\n2:55:39.700 --> 2:55:47.620\n I had a dog for 10 years who passed away a while ago and experienced unbelievable love\n\n2:55:47.620 --> 2:55:48.620\n with her.\n\n2:55:48.620 --> 2:55:52.020\n It can be love of that which you create and we were talking about the flow states that\n\n2:55:52.020 --> 2:55:57.180\n we enter and the pride or lack of pride or in the Minsky case, your hatred of that which\n\n2:55:57.180 --> 2:55:58.180\n you've done.\n\n2:55:58.180 --> 2:56:05.940\n But nonetheless, the creations that we make and whether it's the love or the joy or the\n\n2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:11.580\n engagement or the perspective shift that that cascades into other minds, I think that's\n\n2:56:11.580 --> 2:56:13.680\n a big, big, big part of the meaning of life.\n\n2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:18.740\n It's not something that everybody participates in necessarily, although I think we all do\n\n2:56:18.740 --> 2:56:25.740\n at least in a very local level by the example that we set, by the interactions that we have.\n\n2:56:25.740 --> 2:56:31.900\n But for people who create works that travel far and reach people they'll never meet, that\n\n2:56:31.900 --> 2:56:36.700\n reach countries they'll never visit, that reach people perhaps that come along and come\n\n2:56:36.700 --> 2:56:40.740\n across their ideas or their works or their stories or their aesthetic creations of other\n\n2:56:40.740 --> 2:56:46.860\n sorts long after they're dead, I think that's really, really big part of the fabric of the\n\n2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:50.380\n meaning of life.\n\n2:56:50.380 --> 2:57:01.100\n So all these things like love and creation, I think really is what it's all about.\n\n2:57:01.100 --> 2:57:03.820\n And part of love is also the loss of it.\n\n2:57:03.820 --> 2:57:13.380\n There's a Louis episode with Louis C.K. where an old gentleman is giving him advice that\n\n2:57:13.380 --> 2:57:18.100\n sometimes the sweetest parts of love is when you lose it and you remember it, sort of you\n\n2:57:18.100 --> 2:57:21.020\n reminisce on the loss of it.\n\n2:57:21.020 --> 2:57:27.380\n And there's some aspect in which, and I have many of those in my own life, that almost\n\n2:57:27.380 --> 2:57:34.100\n like the memories of it and the intensity of emotion you still feel about it is like\n\n2:57:34.100 --> 2:57:37.020\n the sweetest part.\n\n2:57:37.020 --> 2:57:40.900\n You're like, after saying goodbye, you relive it.\n\n2:57:40.900 --> 2:57:45.420\n So that goodbye is also a part of love.\n\n2:57:45.420 --> 2:57:47.220\n The loss of it is also a part of love.\n\n2:57:47.220 --> 2:57:49.580\n I don't know, it's back to that scarcity.\n\n2:57:49.580 --> 2:57:56.180\n I won't say the loss is the best part personally, but it definitely is an aspect of it.\n\n2:57:56.180 --> 2:58:03.100\n And the grief you might feel about something that's gone makes you realize what a big deal\n\n2:58:03.100 --> 2:58:06.900\n it was.\n\n2:58:06.900 --> 2:58:14.100\n Speaking of which, this particular journey we went on together come to an end.\n\n2:58:14.100 --> 2:58:16.540\n So I have to say goodbye and I hate saying goodbye.\n\n2:58:16.540 --> 2:58:18.100\n Rob, this is truly an honor.\n\n2:58:18.100 --> 2:58:20.500\n I've really been a big fan.\n\n2:58:20.500 --> 2:58:24.180\n People should definitely check out your podcast, your Master What You Do in the conversation\n\n2:58:24.180 --> 2:58:26.120\n space, in the writing space.\n\n2:58:26.120 --> 2:58:29.820\n It's been an incredible honor that you would show up here and spend this time with me.\n\n2:58:29.820 --> 2:58:30.940\n I really, really appreciate it.\n\n2:58:30.940 --> 2:58:35.780\n Well, it's been a huge honor to be here as well, and also a fan in heaven for a long\n\n2:58:35.780 --> 2:58:36.780\n time.\n\n2:58:36.780 --> 2:58:40.180\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rob Reed.\n\n2:58:40.180 -->

2:58:52.580\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Plato.\n\n2:58:52.580 --> 2:58:55.700\n We can easily forgive a child who's afraid of the dark.\n\n2:58:55.700 --> 2:59:00.900\n The real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.\n\n2:59:00.900 --> 2:59:12.340\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
