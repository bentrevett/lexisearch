a robotics company that for 29 years\n\n00:08.180 --> 00:11.180\n has been creating robots that operate successfully\n\n00:11.180 --> 00:12.560\n in the real world.\n\n00:12.560 --> 00:15.600\n Not as a demo or on a scale of dozens,\n\n00:15.600 --> 00:18.860\n but on a scale of thousands and millions.\n\n00:18.860 --> 00:21.900\n As of this year, iRobot has sold more than\n\n00:21.900 --> 00:25.700\n 25 million robots to consumers,\n\n00:25.700 --> 00:28.160\n including the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot,\n\n00:28.160 --> 00:29.960\n the Bravo floor mopping robot,\n\n00:29.960 --> 00:33.960\n and soon the Terra lawn mowing robot.\n\n00:33.960 --> 00:37.640\n 29 million robots successfully operating autonomously\n\n00:37.640 --> 00:39.640\n in real people's homes,\n\n00:39.640 --> 00:42.060\n to me is an incredible accomplishment\n\n00:42.060 --> 00:45.060\n of science, engineering, logistics,\n\n00:45.060 --> 00:48.760\n and all kinds of general entrepreneurial innovation.\n\n00:48.760 --> 00:51.320\n Most robotics companies fail.\n\n00:51.320 --> 00:56.320\n iRobot has survived and succeeded for 29 years.\n\n00:56.320 --> 00:58.860\n I spent all day at iRobot,\n\n00:58.860 --> 01:01.440\n including a long tour and conversation with Colin\n\n01:01.440 --> 01:03.480\n about the history of iRobot,\n\n01:03.480 --> 01:06.740\n and then sat down for this podcast conversation\n\n01:06.740 --> 01:08.560\n that would have been much longer\n\n01:08.560 --> 01:10.780\n if I didn't spend all day learning about\n\n01:10.780 --> 01:12.340\n and playing with the various robots\n\n01:12.340 --> 01:13.980\n and the company's history.\n\n01:13.980 --> 01:17.520\n I'll release the video of the tour separately.\n\n01:17.520 --> 01:21.900\n Colin, iRobot, its founding team, its current team,\n\n01:21.900 --> 01:24.660\n and its mission has been and continues to be\n\n01:24.660 --> 01:27.620\n an inspiration to me and thousands of engineers\n\n01:27.620 --> 01:30.260\n who are working hard to create AI systems\n\n01:30.260 --> 01:33.020\n that help real people.\n\n01:33.020 --> 01:35.660\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:35.660 --> 01:38.020\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:38.020 --> 01:39.820\n give it five stars on iTunes,\n\n01:39.820 --> 01:41.300\n support it on Patreon,\n\n01:41.300 --> 01:43.300\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:43.300 --> 01:47.140\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:47.140 --> 01:51.120\n And now, here's my conversation with Colin Angle.\n\n01:51.120 --> 01:55.200\n In his 1942 short story, Runaround,\n\n01:55.200 --> 02:00.000\n from his iRobot collection, Asimov proposed\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:02.880\n the three laws of robotics in order,\n\n02:02.880 --> 02:06.840\n don't harm humans, obey orders, protect yourself.\n\n02:06.840 --> 02:07.720\n So two questions.\n\n02:07.720 --> 02:11.680\n First, does the Roomba follow these three laws?\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:14.800\n And also, more seriously,\n\n02:14.800 --> 02:17.160\n what role do you hope to see robots take\n\n02:17.160 --> 02:21.320\n in modern society and in the future world?\n\n02:21.320 --> 02:25.760\n So the three laws are very thought provoking\n\n02:25.760 --> 02:30.760\n and require such a profound understanding\n\n02:31.400 --> 02:36.280\n of the world a robot lives in,\n\n02:36.280 --> 02:40.040\n the ramifications of its action and its own sense of self\n\n02:40.040 --> 02:45.040\n that it's not a relevant bar,\n\n02:45.040 --> 02:50.040\n at least it won't be a relevant bar for decades to come.\n\n02:50.120 --> 02:54.560\n And so if Roomba follows the three laws,\n\n02:54.560 --> 02:56.900\n and I believe it does,\n\n02:58.000 --> 03:00.920\n it is designed to help humans, not hurt them,\n\n03:00.920 --> 03:03.120\n it's designed to be inherently safe,\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:05.980\n and we designed it to last a long time.\n\n03:07.200 --> 03:11.600\n It's not through any AI or intent on the robot's part.\n\n03:11.600 --> 03:14.960\n It's because following the three laws\n\n03:14.960 --> 03:18.220\n is aligned with being a good robot product.\n\n03:19.620 --> 03:23.120\n So I guess it does,\n\n03:23.120 --> 03:27.240\n but not by explicit design.\n\n03:27.240 --> 03:28.800\n So then the bigger picture,\n\n03:28.800 --> 03:33.040\n what role do you hope to see robotics, robots take\n\n03:33.040 --> 03:37.360\n in what's currently mostly a world of humans?\n\n03:37.360 --> 03:42.360\n We need robots to help us continue\n\n03:42.360 --> 03:44.960\n to improve our standard of living.\n\n03:46.120 --> 03:51.120\n We need robots because the average age\n\n03:51.320 --> 03:55.040\n of humanity is increasing very quickly,\n\n03:55.040 --> 03:59.760\n and simply the number of people young enough\n\n03:59.760 --> 04:01.600\n and spry enough to care\n\n04:01.600 --> 04:06.600\n for the elder growing demographic is inadequate.\n\n04:08.800 --> 04:11.400\n And so what is the role of robots?\n\n04:11.400 --> 04:14.880\n Today, the role is to make our lives a little easier,\n\n04:14.880 --> 04:17.320\n a little cleaner, maybe a little healthier.\n\n04:18.480 --> 04:22.120\n But in time, robots are going to be the difference\n\n04:22.120 --> 04:25.680\n between real gut wrenching declines\n\n04:25.680 --> 04:28.080\n in our ability to live independently\n\n04:28.080 --> 04:30.240\n and maintain our standard of living,\n\n04:30.240 --> 04:34.880\n and a future that is the bright one\n\n04:34.880 --> 04:37.480\n where we have more control over our lives,\n\n04:37.480 --> 04:40.560\n can spend more of our time focused\n\n04:40.560 --> 04:43.160\n on activities we choose.\n\n04:44.560 --> 04:47.920\n And I'm so honored and excited\n\n04:47.920 --> 04:50.400\n to be playing a role in that journey.\n\n04:50.400 --> 04:51.720\n So you've given me a tour.\n\n04:51.720 --> 04:53.960\n It showed me some of the long histories,\n\n04:53.960 --> 04:57.120\n now 29 years that iRobot has been at it,\n\n04:57.120 --> 04:59.200\n creating some incredible robots.\n\n04:59.200 --> 05:01.160\n You showed me Pacbot.\n\n05:01.160 --> 05:04.480\n You showed me a bunch of other stuff that led up to Roomba,\n\n05:04.480 --> 05:08.640\n that led to Braava and Terra.\n\n05:08.640 --> 05:13.640\n So let's skip that incredible history\n\n05:14.080 --> 05:15.040\n in the interest of time,\n\n05:15.040 --> 05:16.120\n cause we already talked about it.\n\n05:16.120 --> 05:18.040\n I'll show this incredible footage.\n\n05:18.040 --> 05:22.640\n You mentioned elderly and robotics in society.\n\n05:22.640 --> 05:26.280\n I think the home is a fascinating place for robots to be.\n\n05:26.280 --> 05:29.800\n So where do you see robots in the home?\n\n05:29.800 --> 05:31.640\n Currently, I would say, once again,\n\n05:31.640 --> 05:34.520\n probably most homes in the world don't have a robot.\n\n05:34.520 --> 05:36.160\n So how do you see that changing?\n\n05:36.160 --> 05:39.840\n What do you think is the big initial value add\n\n05:39.840 --> 05:41.920\n that robots can do?\n\n05:41.920 --> 05:44.960\n So iRobot has sort of, over the years,\n\n05:44.960 --> 05:49.360\n narrowed in on the home, the consumer's home,\n\n05:49.360 --> 05:53.120\n as the place where we want to innovate\n\n05:53.120 --> 05:58.120\n and deliver tools that will help a home\n\n05:59.360 --> 06:04.240\n be a more automatically maintained place,\n\n06:04.240 --> 06:06.800\n a healthier place, a safer place,\n\n06:06.800 --> 06:11.480\n and perhaps even a more efficient place to be.\n\n06:11.480 --> 06:15.040\n And today, we vacuum, we mop,\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:16.960\n soon we'll be mowing your lawn.\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:21.480\n But where things are going is,\n\n06:22.720 --> 06:27.080\n when do we get to the point where the home,\n\n06:27.080 --> 06:29.120\n not just the robots that live in your home,\n\n06:29.120 --> 06:32.160\n but the home itself becomes part of a system\n\n06:32.160 --> 06:35.960\n that maintains itself and plays an active role\n\n06:35.960 --> 06:40.760\n in caring for and helping the people live in that home.\n\n06:40.760 --> 06:43.200\n And I see everything that we're doing\n\n06:43.200 --> 06:46.160\n as steps along the path toward that future.\n\n06:46.160 --> 06:47.720\n So what are the steps?\n\n06:47.720 --> 06:51.720\n So if we can summarize some of the history of Roomba,\n\n06:53.280 --> 06:55.520\n you've mentioned, and maybe you can elaborate on it,\n\n06:55.520 --> 06:57.240\n but you mentioned that the early days\n\n06:57.240 --> 07:02.240\n were really taking a robot from something that works\n\n07:02.320 --> 07:04.880\n either in the lab or something that works in the field\n\n07:04.880 --> 07:09.880\n that helps soldiers do the difficult work they do\n\n07:10.200 --> 07:12.640\n to actually be in the hands of consumers\n\n07:12.640 --> 07:15.640\n and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of robots\n\n07:15.640 --> 07:18.480\n that don't break down over how much people love them\n\n07:18.480 --> 07:21.440\n over months of very extensive use.\n\n07:21.440 --> 07:22.840\n So that was the big first step.\n\n07:22.840 --> 07:26.000\n And then the second big step was the ability\n\n07:26.000 --> 07:29.920\n to sense the environment, to build a map, to localize,\n\n07:29.920 --> 07:32.560\n to be able to build a picture of the home\n\n07:32.560 --> 07:34.600\n that the human can then attach labels to\n\n07:34.600 --> 07:38.400\n in terms of giving some semantic knowledge\n\n07:38.400 --> 07:40.880\n to the robot about its environment.\n\n07:40.880 --> 07:44.840\n Okay, so that's like a huge, two big, huge steps.\n\n07:46.320 --> 07:47.520\n Maybe you can comment on them,\n\n07:47.520 --> 07:51.040\n but also what is the next step\n\n07:51.040 --> 07:54.720\n of making a robot part of the home?\n\n07:54.720 --> 07:57.840\n Sure, so the goal is to make a home\n\n07:57.840 --> 08:01.280\n that takes care of itself,\n\n08:01.280 --> 08:03.680\n takes care of the people in the home,\n\n08:03.680 --> 08:07.840\n and gives the user an experience of just living their life\n\n08:07.840 --> 08:10.840\n and the home is somehow doing the right thing,\n\n08:10.840 --> 08:14.120\n turning on and off lights when you leave,\n\n08:14.120 --> 08:17.240\n cleaning up the environment.\n\n08:17.240 --> 08:24.920\n And we went from robots that were great in the lab,\n\n08:24.920 --> 08:27.200\n but were both too expensive\n\n08:27.200 --> 08:32.880\n and not sufficiently capable to ever do an acceptable job\n\n08:32.880 --> 08:37.280\n of anything other than being a toy or a curio in your home\n\n08:37.280 --> 08:42.080\n to something that was both affordable\n\n08:42.080 --> 08:45.720\n and sufficiently effective to drive,\n\n08:45.720 --> 08:50.600\n be above threshold and drive purchase intent.\n\n08:50.600 --> 08:55.440\n Now we've disrupted the entire vacuuming industry.\n\n08:55.440 --> 08:59.760\n The number one selling vacuums, for example, in the US\n\n08:59.760 --> 09:02.840\n are Roombas, so not robot vacuums, but vacuums,\n\n09:02.840 --> 09:05.480\n and that's really crazy and weird.\n\n09:05.480 --> 09:08.000\n We need to pause that. I mean, that's incredible.\n\n09:08.000 --> 09:10.440\n That's incredible that a robot\n\n09:10.440 --> 09:15.480\n is the number one selling thing that does something.\n\n09:15.480 --> 09:17.880\n Yep. Something as essential as vacuuming.\n\n09:17.880 --> 09:20.000\n Yep. Congratulations.\n\n09:20.000 --> 09:22.360\n Thank you. It's still kind of fun to say,\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:26.520\n but just because this was a crazy idea\n\n09:26.520 --> 09:30.880\n that just started, you know, in a room here,\n\n09:30.880 --> 09:33.600\n we're like, do you think we can do this?\n\n09:33.600 --> 09:35.960\n So, hey, let's give it a try.\n\n09:35.960 --> 09:42.760\n But now the robots are starting to understand their environment.\n\n09:42.760 --> 09:46.240\n And if you think about the next step,\n\n09:46.240 --> 09:48.640\n there's two dimensions.\n\n09:48.640 --> 09:52.960\n I've been working so hard since the beginning of iRobot\n\n09:52.960 --> 09:55.000\n to make robots are autonomous,\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.560\n that, you know, they're smart enough\n\n09:57.560 --> 09:59.400\n and understand their task enough,\n\n09:59.400 --> 10:04.080\n they can just go do it without human involvement.\n\n10:04.080 --> 10:07.360\n Now what I'm really excited and working on\n\n10:07.360 --> 10:10.560\n is how do I make them less autonomous?\n\n10:10.560 --> 10:15.680\n Meaning that the robot is supposed to be your partner,\n\n10:15.680 --> 10:20.120\n not this automaton that just goes and does what a robot does.\n\n10:20.120 --> 10:23.440\n And so that if you tell it,\n\n10:23.440 --> 10:27.080\n hey, I just dropped some flour by the fridge in the kitchen,\n\n10:27.080 --> 10:28.920\n can you deal with it?\n\n10:28.920 --> 10:32.720\n Wouldn't it be awesome if the right thing just happened\n\n10:32.720 --> 10:35.200\n based on that utterance?\n\n10:35.200 --> 10:37.840\n And to some extent, that's less autonomous\n\n10:37.840 --> 10:40.080\n because it's actually listening to you,\n\n10:40.080 --> 10:44.360\n understanding the context and intent of the sentence,\n\n10:44.360 --> 10:47.360\n mapping it against its understanding\n\n10:47.360 --> 10:52.640\n of the home it lives in and knowing what to do.\n\n10:52.640 --> 10:56.320\n And so that's an area of research.\n\n10:56.320 --> 10:59.360\n It's an area where we're starting to roll out features.\n\n10:59.360 --> 11:02.840\n You can now tell your robot to clean up the kitchen\n\n11:02.840 --> 11:05.840\n and it knows what the kitchen is and can do that.\n\n11:05.840 --> 11:10.400\n And that's sort of 1.0 of where we're going.\n\n11:10.400 --> 11:13.000\n The other cool thing is that we're starting\n\n11:13.000 --> 11:14.600\n to know where stuff is.\n\n11:14.600 --> 11:15.960\n And why is that important?\n\n11:15.960 --> 11:21.480\n Well, robots are supposed to have arms, right?\n\n11:21.480 --> 11:25.200\n Data had an arm, Rosie had an arm, Robbie the robot had an arm.\n\n11:25.200 --> 11:27.680\n I mean, robots are, you know, they are physical things\n\n11:27.680 --> 11:29.480\n that move around in an environment\n\n11:29.480 --> 11:31.200\n and they're supposed to like do work.\n\n11:31.200 --> 11:34.080\n And if you think about it,\n\n11:34.080 --> 11:37.200\n if a robot doesn't know where anything is,\n\n11:37.200 --> 11:38.720\n why should it have an arm?\n\n11:38.720 --> 11:44.320\n But with this new dawn of home understanding\n\n11:44.320 --> 11:47.680\n that we're starting to go enjoy,\n\n11:47.680 --> 11:49.320\n I know where the kitchen is.\n\n11:49.320 --> 11:52.000\n I might in the future know where the refrigerator is.\n\n11:52.000 --> 11:55.240\n I might, if I had an arm, be able to find the handle,\n\n11:55.240 --> 11:58.440\n open it and even get myself a beer.\n\n11:58.440 --> 12:01.880\n Obviously, that's one of the true dreams of robotics\n\n12:01.880 --> 12:03.480\n is to have robots bringing us a beer\n\n12:03.480 --> 12:05.240\n while we watch television.\n\n12:05.240 --> 12:10.960\n But, you know, I think that that new category of tasks\n\n12:10.960 --> 12:14.200\n where physical manipulation, robot arms,\n\n12:14.200 --> 12:20.160\n is just a potpourri of new opportunity and excitement.\n\n12:20.160 --> 12:23.760\n And you see humans as a crucial part of that.\n\n12:23.760 --> 12:26.240\n So you kind of mentioned that.\n\n12:26.240 --> 12:28.880\n And I personally find that a really compelling idea.\n\n12:28.880 --> 12:33.920\n I think full autonomy can only take us so far,\n\n12:33.920 --> 12:35.320\n especially in the home.\n\n12:35.320 --> 12:38.880\n So you see humans as helping the robot understand\n\n12:38.880 --> 12:43.560\n or give deeper meaning to the spatial information.\n\n12:43.560 --> 12:46.760\n Right. It's a partnership.\n\n12:46.760 --> 12:52.760\n The robot is supposed to operate according to descriptors\n\n12:52.760 --> 12:57.040\n that you would use to describe your own home.\n\n12:57.040 --> 13:02.200\n The robot is supposed to, in lieu of better direction,\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:03.920\n kind of go about its routine,\n\n13:03.920 --> 13:07.640\n which ought to be basically right,\n\n13:07.640 --> 13:12.800\n and lead to a home maintained in a way\n\n13:12.800 --> 13:14.960\n that it's learned you like,\n\n13:14.960 --> 13:21.560\n but also be perpetually ready to take direction\n\n13:21.560 --> 13:26.360\n that would activate a different set of behaviors\n\n13:26.360 --> 13:28.960\n or actions to meet a current need\n\n13:28.960 --> 13:32.360\n to the extent it could actually perform that task.\n\n13:32.360 --> 13:35.400\n So I got to ask you, I think this is a fundamental\n\n13:35.400 --> 13:37.000\n and a fascinating question,\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:39.800\n because iRobot has been a successful company\n\n13:39.800 --> 13:42.360\n and a rare successful robotics company.\n\n13:42.360 --> 13:46.760\n So Anki, Jibo, Mayfield Robotics with their robot curry,\n\n13:46.760 --> 13:50.560\n SciFi Works, Rethink Robotics, these are robotics companies\n\n13:50.560 --> 13:54.040\n that were founded and run by brilliant people.\n\n13:54.040 --> 13:59.680\n But all, very unfortunately, at least for us roboticists,\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:02.120\n all went out of business recently.\n\n14:02.120 --> 14:05.120\n So why do you think they didn't last longer?\n\n14:05.120 --> 14:10.640\n Why do you think it is so hard to keep a robotics company alive?\n\n14:10.640 --> 14:14.120\n You know, I say this only partially in jest\n\n14:14.120 --> 14:17.800\n that back in the day before Roomba,\n\n14:17.800 --> 14:23.920\n you know, I was a high tech entrepreneur building robots.\n\n14:23.920 --> 14:26.400\n But it wasn't until I became a vacuum cleaner salesman\n\n14:26.400 --> 14:29.400\n that we had any success.\n\n14:29.400 --> 14:34.200\n So, I mean, the point is technology alone\n\n14:34.200 --> 14:37.680\n doesn't equal a successful business.\n\n14:37.680 --> 14:43.560\n We need to go and find the compelling need\n\n14:43.560 --> 14:47.600\n where the robot that we're creating\n\n14:47.600 --> 14:53.600\n can deliver clearly more value to the end user\n\n14:53.600 --> 14:55.400\n than it costs.\n\n14:55.400 --> 14:59.000\n And this is not a marginal thing\n\n14:59.000 --> 15:00.400\n where you're looking at the scale and you're like,\n\n15:00.400 --> 15:01.800\n yeah, it's close.\n\n15:01.800 --> 15:04.360\n Maybe we can hold our breath and make it work.\n\n15:04.360 --> 15:11.560\n It's clearly more value than the cost of the robot\n\n15:11.560 --> 15:13.840\n to bring, you know, in the store.\n\n15:13.840 --> 15:17.440\n And I think that the challenge has been finding\n\n15:17.440 --> 15:24.760\n those businesses where that's true\n\n15:24.760 --> 15:28.240\n in a sustainable fashion.\n\n15:28.240 --> 15:34.600\n You know, when you get into entertainment style things,\n\n15:34.600 --> 15:38.240\n you could be the cat's meow one year,\n\n15:38.240 --> 15:43.360\n but 85% of toys, regardless of their merit,\n\n15:43.360 --> 15:45.600\n fail to make it to their second season.\n\n15:45.600 --> 15:48.720\n It's just super hard to do so.\n\n15:48.720 --> 15:53.840\n And so that's just a tough business.\n\n15:53.840 --> 15:57.760\n And there has been a lot of experimentation\n\n15:57.760 --> 16:02.680\n around what is the right type of social companion,\n\n16:02.680 --> 16:05.840\n what is the right robot in the home\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:14.600\n that is doing something other than tasks people do every week\n\n16:14.600 --> 16:17.520\n that they'd rather not do.\n\n16:17.520 --> 16:20.920\n And I'm not sure we've got it all figured out right.\n\n16:20.920 --> 16:23.000\n And so that you get brilliant roboticists\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.720\n with super interesting robots\n\n16:25.720 --> 16:32.880\n that ultimately don't quite have that magical user experience\n\n16:32.880 --> 16:40.600\n and thus that value benefit equation remains ambiguous.\n\n16:40.600 --> 16:45.760\n So you as somebody who dreams of robots changing the world,\n\n16:45.760 --> 16:48.800\n what's your estimate?\n\n16:48.800 --> 16:53.280\n How big is the space of applications\n\n16:53.280 --> 16:55.760\n that fit the criteria that you just described\n\n16:55.760 --> 17:00.560\n where you can really demonstrate an obvious significant value\n\n17:00.560 --> 17:05.720\n over the alternative non robotic solution?\n\n17:05.720 --> 17:10.040\n Well, I think that we're just about none of the way\n\n17:10.040 --> 17:13.400\n to achieving the potential of robotics at home.\n\n17:13.400 --> 17:20.440\n But we have to do it in a really eyes wide open,\n\n17:20.440 --> 17:21.920\n honest fashion.\n\n17:21.920 --> 17:25.440\n And so another way to put that is the potential is infinite\n\n17:25.440 --> 17:27.080\n because we did take a few steps,\n\n17:27.080 --> 17:29.680\n but you're saying those steps are just very initial steps.\n\n17:29.680 --> 17:32.600\n So the Roomba is a hugely successful product,\n\n17:32.600 --> 17:34.280\n but you're saying that's just the very, very beginning.\n\n17:34.280 --> 17:36.560\n That's just the very, very beginning.\n\n17:36.560 --> 17:38.040\n It's the foot in the door.\n\n17:38.040 --> 17:45.120\n And I think I was lucky that in the early days of robotics,\n\n17:45.120 --> 17:48.440\n people would ask me, when are you going to clean my floor?\n\n17:48.440 --> 17:53.600\n It was something that I grew up saying,\n\n17:53.600 --> 17:54.800\n I got all these really good ideas,\n\n17:54.800 --> 17:58.120\n but everyone seems to want their floor clean.\n\n17:58.120 --> 18:02.400\n And so maybe we should do that.\n\n18:02.400 --> 18:03.400\n Yeah, your good ideas.\n\n18:03.400 --> 18:05.840\n Earn the right to do the next thing after that.\n\n18:05.840 --> 18:10.120\n So the good ideas have to match with the desire of the people\n\n18:10.120 --> 18:13.240\n and then the actual cost has to like the business,\n\n18:13.240 --> 18:16.640\n the financial aspect has to all match together.\n\n18:16.640 --> 18:21.240\n Yeah, during our partnership back a number of years ago\n\n18:21.240 --> 18:24.080\n with Johnson Wax, they would explain to me\n\n18:24.080 --> 18:32.520\n that they would go into homes and just watch how people lived\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:35.560\n and try to figure out what were they doing\n\n18:35.560 --> 18:39.960\n that they really didn't really like to do,\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:42.440\n but they had to do it frequently enough\n\n18:42.440 --> 18:51.720\n that it was top of mind and understood as a burden.\n\n18:51.720 --> 18:55.840\n Hey, let's make a product or come up with a solution\n\n18:55.840 --> 19:02.040\n to make that pain point less challenging.\n\n19:02.040 --> 19:07.400\n And sometimes we do certain burdens so often as a society\n\n19:07.400 --> 19:09.400\n that we actually don't even realize,\n\n19:09.400 --> 19:11.480\n like it's actually hard to see that that burden\n\n19:11.480 --> 19:13.200\n is something that could be removed.\n\n19:13.200 --> 19:17.120\n So it does require just going into the home and staring at,\n\n19:17.120 --> 19:19.560\n wait, how do I actually live life?\n\n19:19.560 --> 19:21.080\n What are the pain points?\n\n19:21.080 --> 19:26.400\n Yeah, and getting those insights is a lot harder\n\n19:26.400 --> 19:29.360\n than it would seem it should be in retrospect.\n\n19:29.360 --> 19:33.120\n So how hard on that point?\n\n19:33.120 --> 19:37.440\n I mean, one of the big challenges of robotics\n\n19:37.440 --> 19:42.200\n is driving the cost down to something\n\n19:42.200 --> 19:45.680\n that consumers, people would afford.\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:48.840\n So people would be less likely to buy a Roomba\n\n19:48.840 --> 19:53.320\n if it cost $500,000, which is probably\n\n19:53.320 --> 19:58.040\n sort of what a Roomba would cost several decades ago.\n\n19:58.040 --> 20:02.200\n So how do you drive, which I mentioned is very difficult,\n\n20:02.200 --> 20:05.320\n how do you drive the cost of a Roomba or a robot down\n\n20:05.320 --> 20:07.920\n such that people would want to buy it?\n\n20:07.920 --> 20:11.600\n When I started building robots, the cost of the robot\n\n20:11.600 --> 20:15.480\n had a lot to do with the amount of time it took to build it.\n\n20:15.480 --> 20:18.400\n And so that we build our robots out of aluminum,\n\n20:18.400 --> 20:21.400\n I would go spend my time in the machine shop\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:28.000\n on the milling machine, cutting out the parts and so forth.\n\n20:28.000 --> 20:29.680\n And then when we got into the toy industry,\n\n20:29.680 --> 20:34.280\n I realized that if we were building at scale,\n\n20:34.280 --> 20:35.920\n I could determine the cost of the Roomba\n\n20:35.920 --> 20:38.880\n instead of adding up all the hours to mill out the parts,\n\n20:38.880 --> 20:42.080\n but by weighing it.\n\n20:42.080 --> 20:44.200\n And that's liberating.\n\n20:44.200 --> 20:48.600\n You can say, wow, the world has just\n\n20:48.600 --> 20:51.560\n changed as I think about construction\n\n20:51.560 --> 20:53.160\n in a different way.\n\n20:53.160 --> 20:56.920\n The 3D CAD tools that are available to us today,\n\n20:56.920 --> 21:02.920\n the operating at scale where I can do tooling and injection\n\n21:02.920 --> 21:07.120\n mold, an arbitrarily complicated part,\n\n21:07.120 --> 21:09.840\n and the cost is going to be basically\n\n21:09.840 --> 21:13.960\n the weight of the plastic in that part,\n\n21:13.960 --> 21:16.360\n is incredibly exciting and liberating\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:18.560\n and opens up all sorts of opportunities.\n\n21:18.560 --> 21:26.760\n And for the sensing part of it, where we are today is instead\n\n21:26.760 --> 21:30.640\n of trying to build skin, which is really hard.\n\n21:30.640 --> 21:38.240\n For a long time, I spent creating strategies and ideas\n\n21:38.240 --> 21:42.720\n around how could we duplicate the skin on the human body\n\n21:42.720 --> 21:45.000\n because it's such an amazing sensor.\n\n21:47.880 --> 21:53.920\n Instead of going down that path, why don't we focus on vision?\n\n21:53.920 --> 21:57.280\n And how many of the problems that\n\n21:57.280 --> 22:02.880\n face a robot trying to do real work\n\n22:02.880 --> 22:09.680\n could be solved with a cheap camera and a big ass computer?\n\n22:09.680 --> 22:12.360\n Moore's law continues to work.\n\n22:12.360 --> 22:16.440\n The cell phone industry, the mobile industry\n\n22:16.440 --> 22:19.360\n is giving us better and better tools that can run\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:21.000\n on these embedded computers.\n\n22:21.000 --> 22:27.880\n And I think we passed an important moment maybe\n\n22:27.880 --> 22:33.640\n two years ago where you could put machine vision\n\n22:33.640 --> 22:39.520\n capable processors on robots at consumer price points.\n\n22:39.520 --> 22:42.960\n And I was waiting for it to happen.\n\n22:42.960 --> 22:49.480\n We avoided putting lasers on our robots to do navigation\n\n22:49.480 --> 22:51.800\n and instead spent years researching\n\n22:51.800 --> 22:54.600\n how to do vision based navigation\n\n22:54.600 --> 23:00.400\n because you could just see where these technology\n\n23:00.400 --> 23:01.520\n trends were going.\n\n23:01.520 --> 23:06.680\n And between injection molded plastic and a camera\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:10.800\n with a computer capable of running machine learning\n\n23:10.800 --> 23:12.920\n and visual object recognition, I could\n\n23:12.920 --> 23:18.640\n build an incredibly affordable, incredibly capable robot.\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:21.160\n And that's going to be the future.\n\n23:21.160 --> 23:23.400\n So on that point with a small tangent,\n\n23:23.400 --> 23:27.000\n but I think an important one, another industry in which I\n\n23:27.000 --> 23:30.760\n would say the only other industry in which there\n\n23:30.760 --> 23:34.760\n is automation actually touching people's lives today\n\n23:34.760 --> 23:37.560\n is autonomous vehicles.\n\n23:37.560 --> 23:40.160\n What the vision you just described\n\n23:40.160 --> 23:44.400\n of using computer vision and using cheap camera sensors,\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:48.160\n there's a debate on that of LIDAR versus computer vision.\n\n23:48.160 --> 23:54.360\n And the Elon Musk famously said that LIDAR\n\n23:54.360 --> 23:58.360\n is a crutch that really in the long term,\n\n23:58.360 --> 24:02.000\n camera only is the right solution, which echoes some\n\n24:02.000 --> 24:03.480\n of the ideas you're expressing.\n\n24:03.480 --> 24:06.760\n Of course, the domain in terms of its safety criticality\n\n24:06.760 --> 24:07.600\n is different.\n\n24:07.600 --> 24:10.640\n But what do you think about that approach\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:13.360\n in the autonomous vehicle space?\n\n24:13.360 --> 24:15.160\n And in general, do you see a connection\n\n24:15.160 --> 24:18.480\n between the incredible real world challenges\n\n24:18.480 --> 24:20.680\n you have to solve in the home with Roomba?\n\n24:20.680 --> 24:24.000\n And I saw a demonstration of some of them, corner cases\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:27.800\n literally, and autonomous vehicles.\n\n24:27.800 --> 24:31.600\n So there's absolutely a tremendous overlap\n\n24:31.600 --> 24:36.560\n between both the problems a robot vacuum\n\n24:36.560 --> 24:38.560\n and an autonomous vehicle are trying to solve\n\n24:38.560 --> 24:41.840\n and the tools and the types of sensors\n\n24:41.840 --> 24:47.960\n that are being applied in the pursuit of the solutions.\n\n24:47.960 --> 24:53.880\n In my world, my environment is actually\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:57.320\n much harder than the environment an automobile travels.\n\n24:57.320 --> 24:58.800\n We don't have roads.\n\n24:58.800 --> 25:01.280\n We have t shirts.\n\n25:01.280 --> 25:02.680\n We have steps.\n\n25:02.680 --> 25:07.120\n We have a near infinite number of patterns and colors\n\n25:07.120 --> 25:10.160\n and surface textures on the floor.\n\n25:10.160 --> 25:11.960\n Especially from a visual perspective.\n\n25:11.960 --> 25:18.840\n So the way the world looks is an infinitely variable.\n\n25:18.840 --> 25:22.520\n On the other hand, safety is way easier on the inside.\n\n25:22.520 --> 25:26.480\n My robots, they're not very heavy.\n\n25:26.480 --> 25:28.280\n They're not very fast.\n\n25:28.280 --> 25:32.680\n If they bump into your foot, you think it's funny.\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:39.400\n And autonomous vehicles kind of have the inverse problem.\n\n25:39.400 --> 25:45.920\n And so that for me saying vision is the future,\n\n25:45.920 --> 25:49.440\n I can say that without reservation.\n\n25:49.440 --> 25:51.720\n For autonomous vehicles, I think I\n\n25:51.720 --> 25:56.840\n believe what Elon's saying about the future\n\n25:56.840 --> 25:59.040\n is ultimately going to be vision.\n\n25:59.040 --> 26:02.000\n Maybe if we put a cheap lighter on there as a backup sensor,\n\n26:02.000 --> 26:03.800\n it might not be the worst idea in the world.\n\n26:03.800 --> 26:05.000\n So the stakes are much higher.\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:05.840\n The stakes are much higher.\n\n26:05.840 --> 26:09.080\n You have to be much more careful thinking through how far away\n\n26:09.080 --> 26:10.720\n that future is.\n\n26:10.720 --> 26:11.520\n Right.\n\n26:11.520 --> 26:17.880\n But I think that the primary environmental understanding\n\n26:17.880 --> 26:21.800\n sensor is going to be a visual system.\n\n26:21.800 --> 26:23.000\n Visual system.\n\n26:23.000 --> 26:25.560\n So on that point, well, let me ask,\n\n26:25.560 --> 26:29.440\n do you hope there's an iRobot robot in every home\n\n26:29.440 --> 26:31.880\n in the world one day?\n\n26:31.880 --> 26:38.120\n I expect there to be at least one iRobot robot in every home.\n\n26:38.120 --> 26:41.160\n We've sold 25 million robots.\n\n26:41.160 --> 26:47.080\n So we're in about 10% of US homes, which is a great start.\n\n26:47.080 --> 26:52.240\n But I think that when we think about the numbers of things\n\n26:52.240 --> 26:57.520\n that robots can do, today I can vacuum your floor,\n\n26:57.520 --> 27:00.040\n mop your floor, cut your lawn, or soon\n\n27:00.040 --> 27:02.880\n we'll be able to cut your lawn.\n\n27:02.880 --> 27:06.640\n But there are more things that we could do in the home.\n\n27:06.640 --> 27:12.240\n And I hope that we continue using the techniques I described\n\n27:12.240 --> 27:16.240\n around exploiting computer vision and low cost\n\n27:16.240 --> 27:20.960\n manufacturing that we'll be able to create these solutions\n\n27:20.960 --> 27:22.640\n at affordable price points.\n\n27:22.640 --> 27:25.600\n So let me ask on that point of a robot in every home,\n\n27:25.600 --> 27:26.880\n that's my dream as well.\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:29.960\n I'd love to see that.\n\n27:29.960 --> 27:31.880\n I think the possibilities there are indeed\n\n27:31.880 --> 27:34.520\n infinite positive possibilities.\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:39.760\n But in our current culture, no thanks to science fiction\n\n27:39.760 --> 27:45.320\n and so on, there's a serious kind of hesitation, anxiety,\n\n27:45.320 --> 27:51.480\n concern about robots, and also a concern about privacy.\n\n27:51.480 --> 27:55.040\n And it's a fascinating question to me\n\n27:55.040 --> 27:59.560\n why that concern is amongst a certain group of people\n\n27:59.560 --> 28:02.840\n is as intense as it is.\n\n28:02.840 --> 28:05.480\n So you have to think about it because it's a serious concern.\n\n28:05.480 --> 28:08.000\n But I wonder how you address it best.\n\n28:08.000 --> 28:09.840\n So from a perspective of vision sensors,\n\n28:09.840 --> 28:14.320\n so robots that move about the home and sense the world,\n\n28:14.320 --> 28:19.720\n how do you alleviate people's privacy concerns?\n\n28:19.720 --> 28:21.080\n How do you make sure that they can\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:26.680\n trust iRobot and the robots that they share their home with?\n\n28:26.680 --> 28:28.200\n I think that's a great question.\n\n28:28.200 --> 28:33.760\n And we've really leaned way forward on this\n\n28:33.760 --> 28:39.440\n because given our vision as to the role the company intends\n\n28:39.440 --> 28:43.720\n to play in the home, really for us,\n\n28:43.720 --> 28:48.160\n make or break is can our approach\n\n28:48.160 --> 28:50.920\n be trusted to protecting the data\n\n28:50.920 --> 28:53.520\n and the privacy of the people who have our robots?\n\n28:53.520 --> 28:57.600\n And so we've gone out publicly with a privacy\n\n28:57.600 --> 29:00.360\n manifesto stating we'll never sell your data.\n\n29:00.360 --> 29:05.480\n We've adopted GDPR not just where GDPR is required,\n\n29:05.480 --> 29:09.120\n but globally.\n\n29:09.120 --> 29:18.000\n We have ensured that images don't leave the robot.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.080\n So processing data from the visual sensors\n\n29:22.080 --> 29:23.680\n happens locally on the robot.\n\n29:23.680 --> 29:30.720\n And only semantic knowledge of the home with the consumer's\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:32.720\n consent is sent up.\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:35.400\n We show you what we know and are trying\n\n29:35.400 --> 29:45.000\n to go use data as an enabler for the performance of the robots\n\n29:45.000 --> 29:50.720\n with the informed consent and understanding of the people who\n\n29:50.720 --> 29:55.720\n own those robots.\n\n29:55.720 --> 29:56.840\n We take it very seriously.\n\n29:56.840 --> 30:03.840\n And ultimately, we think that by showing a customer that\n\n30:03.840 --> 30:07.320\n if you let us build a semantic map of your home\n\n30:07.320 --> 30:09.240\n and know where the rooms are, well, then\n\n30:09.240 --> 30:11.720\n you can say clean the kitchen.\n\n30:11.720 --> 30:14.480\n If you don't want the robot to do that, don't make the map.\n\n30:14.480 --> 30:16.960\n It'll do its best job cleaning your home.\n\n30:16.960 --> 30:18.720\n But it won't be able to do that.\n\n30:18.720 --> 30:21.120\n And if you ever want us to forget that we know that it's\n\n30:21.120 --> 30:24.400\n your kitchen, you can have confidence\n\n30:24.400 --> 30:26.800\n that we will do that for you.\n\n30:26.800 --> 30:35.800\n So we're trying to go and be a data 2.0 perspective company\n\n30:35.800 --> 30:39.200\n where we treat the data that the robots have\n\n30:39.200 --> 30:43.200\n of the consumer's home as if it were the consumer's data\n\n30:43.200 --> 30:47.360\n and that they have rights to it.\n\n30:47.360 --> 30:50.880\n So we think by being the good guys on this front,\n\n30:50.880 --> 30:55.080\n we can build the trust and thus be entrusted\n\n30:55.080 --> 31:00.160\n to enable robots to do more things that are thoughtful.\n\n31:00.160 --> 31:04.760\n You think people's worries will diminish over time?\n\n31:04.760 --> 31:07.040\n As a society, broadly speaking, do you\n\n31:07.040 --> 31:10.600\n think you can win over trust not just for the company,\n\n31:10.600 --> 31:14.920\n but just the comfort that people have with AI in their home\n\n31:14.920 --> 31:17.040\n enriching their lives in some way?\n\n31:17.040 --> 31:19.560\n I think we're in an interesting place today\n\n31:19.560 --> 31:22.360\n where it's less about winning them over\n\n31:22.360 --> 31:26.720\n and more about finding a way to talk about privacy in a way\n\n31:26.720 --> 31:28.880\n that more people can understand.\n\n31:28.880 --> 31:33.320\n I would tell you that today, when there's a privacy breach,\n\n31:33.320 --> 31:37.000\n people get very upset and then go to the store\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.320\n and buy the cheapest thing, paying no attention\n\n31:39.320 --> 31:42.080\n to whether or not the products that they're buying\n\n31:42.080 --> 31:44.600\n honor privacy standards or not.\n\n31:44.600 --> 31:50.040\n In fact, if I put on the package of my Roomba,\n\n31:50.040 --> 31:53.560\n the privacy commitments that we have,\n\n31:53.560 --> 31:58.680\n I would sell less than I would if I did nothing at all.\n\n31:58.680 --> 32:00.360\n And that needs to change.\n\n32:00.360 --> 32:02.880\n So it's not a question about earning trust.\n\n32:02.880 --> 32:04.920\n I think that's necessary but not sufficient.\n\n32:04.920 --> 32:06.520\n We need to figure out how to have\n\n32:06.520 --> 32:10.800\n a comfortable set of what is the grade A meat\n\n32:10.800 --> 32:17.640\n standard applied to privacy that customers can trust\n\n32:17.640 --> 32:20.280\n and understand and then use in their buying decisions.\n\n32:23.040 --> 32:25.520\n That will reward companies for good behavior\n\n32:25.520 --> 32:29.880\n and that will ultimately be how this moves forward.\n\n32:29.880 --> 32:32.640\n And maybe be part of the conversation\n\n32:32.640 --> 32:34.800\n between regular people about what it means,\n\n32:34.800 --> 32:36.280\n what privacy means.\n\n32:36.280 --> 32:38.440\n If you have some standards, you can say,\n\n32:38.440 --> 32:41.080\n you can start talking about who's following them,\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:42.640\n who does not have more.\n\n32:42.640 --> 32:45.440\n Because most people are actually quite clueless\n\n32:45.440 --> 32:47.320\n about all aspects of artificial intelligence,\n\n32:47.320 --> 32:48.440\n the data collection, and so on.\n\n32:48.440 --> 32:50.560\n It would be nice to change that for people\n\n32:50.560 --> 32:52.800\n to understand the good that AI can do.\n\n32:52.800 --> 32:56.560\n And it's not some system that's trying to steal\n\n32:56.560 --> 32:58.760\n all the most sensitive data.\n\n32:58.760 --> 33:02.640\n Do you think, do you dream of a Roomba\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:05.280\n with human level intelligence one day?\n\n33:05.280 --> 33:10.520\n So you've mentioned a very successful localization\n\n33:10.520 --> 33:12.160\n and mapping of the environment, being\n\n33:12.160 --> 33:14.680\n able to do some basic communication to say,\n\n33:14.680 --> 33:16.600\n go clean the kitchen.\n\n33:16.600 --> 33:22.880\n Do you see in your maybe more bored moments,\n\n33:22.880 --> 33:27.080\n once you get the beer, to sit back with that beer\n\n33:27.080 --> 33:30.840\n and have a chat on a Friday night with a Roomba\n\n33:30.840 --> 33:34.160\n about how your day went?\n\n33:34.160 --> 33:38.640\n So to your latter question, absolutely.\n\n33:38.640 --> 33:40.760\n To your former question as to whether a Roomba\n\n33:40.760 --> 33:45.280\n can have human level intelligence, not in my lifetime.\n\n33:45.280 --> 33:46.440\n You can have you.\n\n33:46.440 --> 33:49.720\n I think you can have a great conversation,\n\n33:49.720 --> 33:54.000\n a meaningful conversation with a Roomba\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:56.320\n without it having anything that resembles\n\n33:56.320 --> 33:59.200\n human level intelligence.\n\n33:59.200 --> 34:04.000\n And I think that as long as you realize that conversation\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:08.600\n is not about the robot and making the robot feel good.\n\n34:08.600 --> 34:14.880\n That conversation is about you learning interesting things\n\n34:14.880 --> 34:18.720\n that make you feel like the conversation that you\n\n34:18.720 --> 34:24.840\n had with the robot is a pretty awesome way\n\n34:24.840 --> 34:27.400\n of learning something.\n\n34:27.400 --> 34:30.920\n And it could be about what kind of day your pet had.\n\n34:30.920 --> 34:36.240\n It could be about how can I make my home more energy efficient.\n\n34:36.240 --> 34:40.000\n It could be about if I'm thinking about climbing\n\n34:40.000 --> 34:41.640\n Mount Everest, what should I know?\n\n34:44.440 --> 34:48.640\n And that's a very doable thing.\n\n34:48.640 --> 34:51.480\n But if I think that that conversation\n\n34:51.480 --> 34:53.760\n I'm going to have with the robot is\n\n34:53.760 --> 34:56.840\n I'm going to be rewarded by making the robot happy,\n\n34:56.840 --> 34:58.720\n well, I could just put a button on the robot\n\n34:58.720 --> 35:00.600\n that you could push and the robot would smile.\n\n35:00.600 --> 35:02.200\n And that sort of thing.\n\n35:02.200 --> 35:04.200\n So I think you need to think about the question\n\n35:04.200 --> 35:06.720\n in the right way.\n\n35:06.720 --> 35:12.680\n And robots can be awesomely effective at helping people\n\n35:12.680 --> 35:16.320\n feel less isolated, learn more about the home\n\n35:16.320 --> 35:21.960\n that they live in, and fill some of those lonely gaps\n\n35:21.960 --> 35:24.320\n that we wish we were engaged learning\n\n35:24.320 --> 35:26.640\n cool stuff about our world.\n\n35:26.640 --> 35:28.800\n Last question.\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:32.280\n If you could hang out for a day with a robot\n\n35:32.280 --> 35:35.760\n from science fiction, movies, books,\n\n35:35.760 --> 35:42.080\n and safely pick its brain for that day, who would you pick?\n\n35:42.080 --> 35:43.320\n Data.\n\n35:43.320 --> 35:43.880\n Data.\n\n35:43.880 --> 35:45.280\n From Star Trek.\n\n35:45.280 --> 35:49.600\n I think that A, data is really smart.\n\n35:49.600 --> 35:51.440\n Data has been through a lot trying\n\n35:51.440 --> 35:53.520\n to go and save the galaxy.\n\n35:53.520 --> 35:59.600\n And I'm really interested actually in emotion\n\n35:59.600 --> 36:01.200\n and robotics.\n\n36:01.200 --> 36:03.120\n And I think you'd have a lot to say about that.\n\n36:03.120 --> 36:08.120\n Because I believe actually that emotion\n\n36:08.120 --> 36:14.280\n plays an incredibly useful role in doing reasonable things\n\n36:14.280 --> 36:16.920\n in situations where we have imperfect understanding of\n\n36:16.920 --> 36:18.000\n what's going on.\n\n36:18.000 --> 36:20.760\n In social situations when there's imperfect information.\n\n36:20.760 --> 36:26.320\n In social situations, also in competitive or dangerous\n\n36:26.320 --> 36:32.880\n situations that we have emotion for a reason.\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:36.320\n And so that ultimately, my theory\n\n36:36.320 --> 36:38.520\n is that as robots get smarter and smarter,\n\n36:38.520 --> 36:41.400\n they're actually going to get more emotional.\n\n36:41.400 --> 36:49.120\n Because you can't actually survive on pure logic.\n\n36:49.120 --> 36:53.800\n Because only a very tiny fraction of the situations\n\n36:53.800 --> 36:57.320\n we find ourselves in can be resolved reasonably with logic.\n\n36:57.320 --> 36:59.600\n And so I think Data would have a lot to say about that.\n\n36:59.600 --> 37:02.360\n And so I could find out whether he agrees.\n\n37:02.360 --> 37:04.840\n If you could ask Data one question,\n\n37:04.840 --> 37:08.560\n you would get a deep, honest answer to what would you ask.\n\n37:08.560 --> 37:12.520\n What's Captain Picard really like?\n\n37:12.520 --> 37:14.320\n OK, I think that's the perfect way to end it.\n\n37:14.320 --> 37:16.040\n Colin, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n37:16.040 --> 37:16.960\n I really appreciate it.\n\n37:16.960 --> 37:19.120\n My pleasure.\n\n"
