  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.960\n The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein,\n\n00:02.960 --> 00:05.640\n the third time we've spoken on this podcast.\n\n00:05.640 --> 00:10.320\n He is the wise turtle master Oogway to my Kung Fu Panda,\n\n00:10.320 --> 00:13.160\n one of my favorite people to talk to in this world.\n\n00:13.160 --> 00:15.480\n A complicated and fascinating mind\n\n00:15.480 --> 00:17.920\n that I'm grateful to have the chance to accompany\n\n00:17.920 --> 00:20.560\n in exploring this world through conversation\n\n00:20.560 --> 00:25.560\n on this podcast and on his, the latter called The Portal.\n\n00:26.400 --> 00:29.240\n Quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts\n\n00:29.240 --> 00:31.220\n related to the episode.\n\n00:31.220 --> 00:35.200\n First is Grammarly, a service I use in my writing\n\n00:35.200 --> 00:37.720\n to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure,\n\n00:37.720 --> 00:39.160\n and readability.\n\n00:39.160 --> 00:43.320\n Second is Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use\n\n00:43.320 --> 00:46.520\n to add healthy variety into my culinary life.\n\n00:47.640 --> 00:51.760\n Third is SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool\n\n00:51.760 --> 00:53.400\n I've ever come across.\n\n00:53.400 --> 00:56.640\n I don't like looking at numbers, but somebody should.\n\n00:56.640 --> 00:58.840\n It helps you make good decisions.\n\n00:58.840 --> 01:03.180\n And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years\n\n01:03.180 --> 01:05.660\n to protect my privacy on the internet.\n\n01:05.660 --> 01:07.960\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:07.960 --> 01:11.680\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:11.680 --> 01:15.840\n As a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me,\n\n01:15.840 --> 01:17.940\n I'm drawn to the possibility of having many more\n\n01:17.940 --> 01:21.280\n conversations with Eric through the years.\n\n01:21.280 --> 01:24.960\n I think we have just the right kind of contrast\n\n01:24.960 --> 01:29.120\n in having worldviews and a deep respect and appreciation\n\n01:29.120 --> 01:32.760\n of each other's life stories that creates for\n\n01:32.760 --> 01:36.240\n this magical experience in the realm of conversation\n\n01:36.240 --> 01:41.240\n that feels like we're always looking for something\n\n01:41.320 --> 01:43.640\n that we never quite find,\n\n01:43.640 --> 01:45.900\n but are always better for having tried.\n\n01:46.800 --> 01:50.200\n I'm not sure how or why the universe has connected\n\n01:50.200 --> 01:52.560\n Eric and me, but it did.\n\n01:52.560 --> 01:56.240\n And I would be a fool not to trust its judgment\n\n01:56.240 --> 01:58.560\n and enjoy the journey.\n\n01:58.560 --> 02:01.440\n If somehow you like this podcast,\n\n02:01.440 --> 02:03.000\n please subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.440\n review it with five stars on

here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.\n\n02:16.460 --> 02:19.520\n Who's the greatest musician of all time, would you say?\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:21.920\n We were just off camera talking about Eddie Van Halen.\n\n02:21.920 --> 02:24.120\n He unfortunately passed away.\n\n02:24.120 --> 02:26.080\n Who's the greatest musician of all time?\n\n02:26.080 --> 02:27.400\n Yeah.\n\n02:27.400 --> 02:28.880\n Jonathan Richman.\n\n02:28.880 --> 02:30.560\n Who's that?\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:31.560\n It's a weird question.\n\n02:31.560 --> 02:32.760\n So I'm gonna give you a weird answer.\n\n02:32.760 --> 02:33.580\n It's not because of...\n\n02:33.580 --> 02:34.420\n Thank you.\n\n02:34.420 --> 02:35.240\n Okay, Jonathan Richman.\n\n02:35.240 --> 02:37.920\n The reason I'm picking on him is that he had a quote.\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:41.540\n He was the front man of a group called the Modern Lovers.\n\n02:41.540 --> 02:43.460\n And his quote was something like,\n\n02:43.460 --> 02:46.560\n \"'We have to be prepared to play music\n\n02:46.560 --> 02:48.360\n \"'when our instruments are broken,\n\n02:48.360 --> 02:50.120\n \"'the electricity's out and it's raining,'\n\n02:50.120 --> 02:52.120\n \"'something like that.\"\n\n02:52.120 --> 02:53.840\n And I thought that that quote was very interesting\n\n02:53.840 --> 02:55.440\n because what it said was,\n\n02:55.440 --> 02:57.600\n you have to be able to strip this thing down\n\n02:57.600 --> 02:58.760\n farther and farther back\n\n02:58.760 --> 03:01.080\n to get to something that is intrinsically musical.\n\n03:01.080 --> 03:05.680\n So we were having a conversation just now about virtuosity.\n\n03:05.680 --> 03:07.960\n We're talking about Eddie Van Halen and his recent passing.\n\n03:07.960 --> 03:09.640\n And that affected me emotionally.\n\n03:09.640 --> 03:10.600\n I don't know whether it affected you.\n\n03:10.600 --> 03:13.600\n I was never a Van Halen, the group fan,\n\n03:13.600 --> 03:18.600\n but I revered Eddie Van Halen's capacity for innovation.\n\n03:18.600 --> 03:23.540\n I saw him like Rodney Mullen, the skateboarder.\n\n03:23.540 --> 03:26.340\n I had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast\n\n03:26.340 --> 03:27.800\n just to talk about what it's like\n\n03:27.800 --> 03:30.700\n to totally discontinuously innovate.\n\n03:30.700 --> 03:33.340\n And he posted a video of Spanish Fly, I think,\n\n03:33.340 --> 03:34.160\n and saying like,\n\n03:34.160 --> 03:36.120\n I didn't know the guitar could make those kinds of sounds.\n\n03:36.120 --> 03:37.260\n Like, what is this voodoo magic?\n\n03:37.260 --> 03:38.520\n What is it?\n\n03:38.520 --> 03:39.440\n Well, this is the thing, right?\n\n03:39.440 --> 03:43.600\n The arpeggios that he did on a single string are so fast\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:46.980\n and the attacks from the hammer ons,\n\n03:46.980 --> 03:51.020\n when they go at light speed as he did, particularly.\n\n03:51.020 --> 03:52.240\n And the reason I chose that was,\n\n03:52.240 --> 03:55.300\n is that I wanted to strip out the electronics\n\n03:55.300 --> 03:56.780\n because part of the claim will be is\n\n03:56.780 --> 03:57.980\n that he's a rock musician.\n\n03:57.980 --> 04:01.380\n And a lot of the innovations had to do with things peculiar\n\n04:01.380 --> 04:03.660\n to sort of the electrified setup.\n\n04:03.660 --> 04:05.780\n His use of the whammy bar, for example,\n\n04:05.780 --> 04:10.060\n or the Frankenstrat that he built from different pieces.\n\n04:11.500 --> 04:15.700\n All of those aspects, in my opinion,\n\n04:15.700 --> 04:19.740\n are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship.\n\n04:19.740 --> 04:21.620\n And that's why I chose Spanish Fly,\n\n04:21.620 --> 04:22.660\n because everyone, of course,\n\n04:22.660 --> 04:24.140\n will go to something like your eruption\n\n04:24.140 --> 04:25.060\n or running with the devil,\n\n04:25.060 --> 04:27.900\n which is the first things that they heard\n\n04:27.900 --> 04:30.020\n that let them know that there was a new force erupting\n\n04:30.020 --> 04:32.820\n out of Southern California that was Eddie Van Halen, right?\n\n04:32.820 --> 04:36.620\n I mean, I'm in love with the story of it.\n\n04:36.620 --> 04:40.300\n You're often so poetic about music.\n\n04:40.300 --> 04:43.980\n Like it clearly touches your soul on many levels.\n\n04:43.980 --> 04:45.460\n What is that?\n\n04:45.460 --> 04:47.780\n Is it deeper than just rocking out\n\n04:47.780 --> 04:52.060\n with the in your convertible Corvette 69?\n\n04:52.060 --> 04:54.580\n I imagine Eric Weinstein is driving down\n\n04:54.580 --> 04:58.420\n the California highways, blasting some kind of music.\n\n04:58.420 --> 05:01.980\n Is it just like being able to be carefree\n\n05:01.980 --> 05:03.220\n for moments of time?\n\n05:03.220 --> 05:05.340\n Or is there something more fundamental\n\n05:05.340 --> 05:08.980\n that connects to like the theory of everything\n\n05:08.980 --> 05:11.700\n in physics and life and all of that?\n\n05:11.700 --> 05:13.940\n How often do you have the chance, for example,\n\n05:13.940 --> 05:17.820\n to hear mathematics performed as you do in Bach, right?\n\n05:17.820 --> 05:19.820\n Like something with that kind of precision\n\n05:19.820 --> 05:22.500\n and elegance that can't really be grasped,\n\n05:22.500 --> 05:27.500\n where to go back to Leonard Cohen's famous line,\n\n05:28.460 --> 05:31.420\n the baffled king composing, right?\n\n05:31.420 --> 05:32.380\n Such a good song.\n\n05:32.380 --> 05:35.300\n Such a good song, but it's also like individual verses\n\n05:35.300 --> 05:38.140\n of that song are insanely important.\n\n05:39.260 --> 05:43.340\n The baffled king is how we often make music.\n\n05:43.340 --> 05:46.700\n We don't really understand what did we just do\n\n05:46.700 --> 05:50.260\n that broke that person's heart sitting on the couch, right?\n\n05:50.260 --> 05:52.240\n And so it's a very strange thing\n\n05:52.240 --> 05:54.060\n that you should be able to have.\n\n05:54.060 --> 05:55.500\n Think of it like you're a computer.\n\n05:55.500 --> 06:00.500\n You've got this weird open music port, port 37.8, you know?\n\n06:00.700 --> 06:03.220\n Like it's not even supposed to be there.\n\n06:03.220 --> 06:05.260\n And suddenly somebody starts playing guitar\n\n06:05.260 --> 06:07.540\n and they're making you feel things.\n\n06:07.540 --> 06:10.260\n Or like in particular, particular instruments\n\n06:10.260 --> 06:14.060\n like the violin, it's so difficult.\n\n06:14.060 --> 06:15.180\n It's so unforgiving.\n\n06:15.180 --> 06:16.960\n And when it gives up its secrets,\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:19.780\n it just, you know, it wraps its fingers\n\n06:19.780 --> 06:22.020\n around your heart and won't let go.\n\n06:22.020 --> 06:24.980\n Sometimes I talk about head, heart, and loins.\n\n06:24.980 --> 06:27.600\n When something can grab your head, heart, and your loins\n\n06:27.600 --> 06:30.660\n at the same moment and integrate them,\n\n06:32.180 --> 06:34.620\n there are very few opportunities to live like that.\n\n06:34.620 --> 06:36.580\n And if you think about Eddie Van Halen,\n\n06:36.580 --> 06:41.580\n as far as your head, the musical innovations\n\n06:42.020 --> 06:43.980\n and the fact that he was drawing directly\n\n06:43.980 --> 06:48.580\n from the classical canon really speaks to the idea\n\n06:48.580 --> 06:53.380\n that maybe rock is what somebody like Jimi Hendrix saw it\n\n06:53.380 --> 06:56.700\n as being, you know, an infinitely extensible medium.\n\n06:56.700 --> 07:01.620\n In terms of heart, I always notice the smile on his face.\n\n07:01.620 --> 07:05.380\n It's painful to look at an Eddie Van Halen solo now.\n\n07:05.380 --> 07:07.580\n Like sometimes you'll see the cigarette dripping off\n\n07:07.580 --> 07:09.580\n the side of his mouth and you're like,\n\n07:09.580 --> 07:10.940\n that's gonna fucking kill you.\n\n07:10.940 --> 07:12.340\n And I'm not even worried about it for you.\n\n07:12.340 --> 07:13.740\n I'm worried about it for me.\n\n07:13.740 --> 07:14.740\n You're gonna rob.\n\n07:14.740 --> 07:16.660\n I don't even need to hear you play another note.\n\n07:16.660 --> 07:19.100\n I just like knowing that you're in the world,\n\n07:19.100 --> 07:22.020\n that there is somebody that everyone looks to that nobody,\n\n07:22.020 --> 07:25.660\n I've never heard a guitarist say, eh, I don't know.\n\n07:25.660 --> 07:26.860\n I think he was okay.\n\n07:26.860 --> 07:28.340\n Like I've never heard it.\n\n07:28.340 --> 07:31.540\n You can hate him, but you still think he was a genius.\n\n07:31.540 --> 07:34.820\n There are very few people like that in the world.\n\n07:34.820 --> 07:37.580\n And then loins, those leaps,\n\n07:37.580 --> 07:39.900\n that guy was incredibly good looking\n\n07:39.900 --> 07:43.060\n and, you know, skin tight pants, super athleticism.\n\n07:43.060 --> 07:47.620\n He completely owned the male sexuality of the stage,\n\n07:47.620 --> 07:50.060\n both being the completely dominant,\n\n07:50.060 --> 07:52.020\n you know, sort of mythical alpha male.\n\n07:52.020 --> 07:54.540\n I hate that expression, but there you are.\n\n07:54.540 --> 07:58.420\n But also this kind of little boy with this mischievous smirk\n\n07:58.420 --> 08:01.740\n and, you know, the sense that it all came together.\n\n08:02.900 --> 08:04.020\n How could you not eat that up?\n\n08:04.020 --> 08:05.900\n You could just imagine the millions\n\n08:05.900 --> 08:07.900\n of like young teenage boys, gorgeous,\n\n08:07.900 --> 08:11.100\n like playing air guitar in their room,\n\n08:11.100 --> 08:13.700\n just that, yeah, basically dreaming\n\n08:13.700 --> 08:15.220\n of being that kind of God,\n\n08:17.500 --> 08:20.340\n the most perfect example of what a human being can be.\n\n08:20.340 --> 08:22.060\n Yeah, it's fascinating to think.\n\n08:22.060 --> 08:24.020\n It is, and then, you know,\n\n08:24.020 --> 08:27.140\n as in many of the cases with these bands,\n\n08:27.140 --> 08:30.700\n you get these multiple talents in the same outfit.\n\n08:30.700 --> 08:33.500\n And I think that the original configuration\n\n08:33.500 --> 08:34.580\n with David Lee Roth, I mean,\n\n08:34.580 --> 08:38.100\n David Lee Roth is such a hot mess at all times.\n\n08:38.100 --> 08:41.540\n I would love you to talk to David Lee Roth.\n\n08:41.540 --> 08:46.540\n Like if the, that dance would be just gorgeous.\n\n08:46.660 --> 08:47.980\n I don't know.\n\n08:47.980 --> 08:48.820\n Can you handle it?\n\n08:48.820 --> 08:49.660\n Can you ride that?\n\n08:49.660 --> 08:50.500\n Probably not.\n\n08:50.500 --> 08:51.340\n Yeah.\n\n08:51.340 --> 08:54.260\n Probably not because I think he's very,\n\n08:54.260 --> 08:57.220\n I get the feeling that he's very smart\n\n08:57.220 --> 09:00.140\n and very dysregulated.\n\n09:00.140 --> 09:02.300\n And I don't know that I could,\n\n09:02.300 --> 09:04.860\n like bring him down to earth for a moment.\n\n09:04.860 --> 09:07.460\n Well, I can also get pretty dysregulated, you know?\n\n09:07.460 --> 09:10.500\n And so I don't know whether, it could be magic.\n\n09:10.500 --> 09:11.700\n It could be a shit show.\n\n09:11.700 --> 09:14.060\n I don't know what you thought of his appearance on Rogan.\n\n09:14.060 --> 09:15.660\n That was an interesting one.\n\n09:15.660 --> 09:17.940\n I loved it, but Joe and that,\n\n09:17.940 --> 09:19.140\n and Joe does this sometimes,\n\n09:19.140 --> 09:21.740\n sometimes he just sits back and listens\n\n09:21.740 --> 09:24.820\n and he just lets like the music play,\n\n09:24.820 --> 09:26.580\n which works really well.\n\n09:26.580 --> 09:31.140\n I think you have a chance to kind of jump into the chaos\n\n09:31.140 --> 09:32.820\n and then you'll just start.\n\n09:32.820 --> 09:34.860\n And the places you will go,\n\n09:34.860 --> 09:37.540\n you may not even talk about music for like hours.\n\n09:37.540 --> 09:38.860\n It might just go to this,\n\n09:38.860 --> 09:40.220\n cause he, I think lives in Japan.\n\n09:40.220 --> 09:41.540\n Like there's a weird,\n\n09:41.540 --> 09:45.020\n he's been an EMT after he was a rock star.\n\n09:45.020 --> 09:47.220\n He chose to be kind of like,\n\n09:47.220 --> 09:48.060\n I don't know.\n\n09:48.060 --> 09:50.900\n You know, it's like there's depth to that man\n\n09:50.900 --> 09:53.980\n that hasn't been explored by him either.\n\n09:53.980 --> 09:56.260\n So that'll be an exciting conversation.\n\n09:56.260 --> 09:58.140\n Can we go back to Larry Cohen?\n\n09:58.140 --> 09:58.980\n Yeah.\n\n09:58.980 --> 09:59.820\n Can we just,\n\n09:59.820 --> 10:03.420\n the things I feel when I listen to Hallelujah\n\n10:03.420 --> 10:05.780\n by Leonard Cohen or anything by him really,\n\n10:05.780 --> 10:06.620\n but that one.\n\n10:07.540 --> 10:08.860\n Do you really want to get into it?\n\n10:08.860 --> 10:09.700\n Let's go.\n\n10:09.700 --> 10:12.780\n What is it that song mean to you?\n\n10:14.620 --> 10:15.820\n Is it love?\n\n10:15.820 --> 10:17.140\n Oh boy.\n\n10:17.140 --> 10:19.900\n Well, first of all, it's mystery.\n\n10:19.900 --> 10:22.540\n Like it starts off about mystery.\n\n10:22.540 --> 10:24.220\n So what are you doing?\n\n10:24.220 --> 10:28.740\n You're doing this alternation between the two chords.\n\n10:28.740 --> 10:30.420\n So three notes at the same time.\n\n10:30.420 --> 10:33.900\n One is called the tonic,\n\n10:33.900 --> 10:36.580\n or you have the major and the relative minor\n\n10:36.580 --> 10:38.380\n and he's alternating between them.\n\n10:38.380 --> 10:39.820\n There's only one note of difference\n\n10:39.820 --> 10:41.140\n between those two chords.\n\n10:41.140 --> 10:42.700\n One of them would be feeling sad.\n\n10:42.700 --> 10:45.540\n One of them would be more joyous, typically described.\n\n10:46.780 --> 10:48.300\n And so by altering one note,\n\n10:48.300 --> 10:50.700\n it's the minimal amount to take you back and forth\n\n10:50.700 --> 10:54.820\n between joy and happiness as that's encoded in us.\n\n10:54.820 --> 10:55.980\n So he starts off with,\n\n10:55.980 --> 10:57.220\n I heard there was a scene,\n\n10:57.220 --> 10:58.500\n David played the please a little bit.\n\n10:58.500 --> 11:00.500\n You don't really care for music, do you?\n\n11:02.420 --> 11:03.740\n That's really interesting\n\n11:03.740 --> 11:06.620\n because he's using this technique called Bethos, right?\n\n11:06.620 --> 11:10.260\n So the alternation between the sublime\n\n11:10.260 --> 11:13.460\n and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right?\n\n11:13.460 --> 11:14.300\n So he's like.\n\n11:15.340 --> 11:16.980\n There's a bitterness to it too.\n\n11:16.980 --> 11:18.260\n Is it just play?\n\n11:18.260 --> 11:19.900\n Well, the way I hear it, again,\n\n11:19.900 --> 11:21.940\n a great song allows for different interpretations.\n\n11:21.940 --> 11:23.260\n You happen to be asking me,\n\n11:23.260 --> 11:24.460\n so I'm going to impart some stuff\n\n11:24.460 --> 11:25.700\n that probably isn't in the song,\n\n11:25.700 --> 11:26.660\n but why it speaks to me,\n\n11:26.660 --> 11:28.980\n that's what makes it great.\n\n11:28.980 --> 11:31.300\n The way I hear it is he doesn't believe the audience.\n\n11:31.300 --> 11:32.740\n You don't really care for music, do you?\n\n11:32.740 --> 11:34.220\n Then what are you doing listening to this?\n\n11:34.220 --> 11:37.500\n You stupid idiots, of course you care for music.\n\n11:37.500 --> 11:39.340\n You're too cool to care.\n\n11:39.340 --> 11:41.500\n So I see through you and screw you.\n\n11:41.500 --> 11:43.620\n That's the energy I get.\n\n11:45.100 --> 11:46.420\n Then he does this weird thing.\n\n11:46.420 --> 11:50.020\n It goes like this is where he should put the description\n\n11:50.020 --> 11:51.660\n of where he is in the chord progression,\n\n11:51.660 --> 11:53.300\n which is the tonic, right?\n\n11:53.300 --> 11:54.140\n It goes like this.\n\n11:54.140 --> 11:56.740\n And then he hits the fourth and the fifth,\n\n11:56.740 --> 11:58.740\n which are the two other major elements,\n\n11:58.740 --> 12:02.020\n the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony.\n\n12:02.020 --> 12:04.700\n So he's describing the chord progression\n\n12:04.700 --> 12:07.060\n in real time in the lyrics.\n\n12:07.060 --> 12:10.220\n There's two ways this can come about in other songs.\n\n12:10.220 --> 12:14.580\n We had this example of every time we say goodbye.\n\n12:14.580 --> 12:15.900\n Do you know this song?\n\n12:15.900 --> 12:17.660\n Every time we say goodbye.\n\n12:17.660 --> 12:20.540\n No, I think it was a Cole Porter, maybe,\n\n12:20.540 --> 12:22.820\n or Gershwin, maybe Porter, I don't know.\n\n12:22.820 --> 12:27.100\n I cry a little, there is no love song finer,\n\n12:27.100 --> 12:32.100\n but how strange the change from major to minor, right?\n\n12:32.500 --> 12:34.820\n Like it's a beautiful use of it.\n\n12:34.820 --> 12:37.380\n Then there's times when it's duplicitous.\n\n12:37.380 --> 12:39.120\n So for example, you'll have,\n\n12:41.260 --> 12:42.660\n I guess my favorite examples of this\n\n12:42.660 --> 12:45.340\n are Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.\n\n12:45.340 --> 12:48.340\n I fell into a burning ring of fire.\n\n12:48.340 --> 12:53.020\n And then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune?\n\n12:53.020 --> 12:55.620\n I went down, down, down.\n\n12:55.620 --> 12:56.940\n He goes up, right?\n\n12:56.940 --> 13:00.180\n And so the idea is like, oh, okay, that was a head fake.\n\n13:00.180 --> 13:04.780\n And another one of these is Nina Simone's Feeling Good.\n\n13:05.860 --> 13:07.340\n Oh, okay, so what do you get?\n\n13:07.340 --> 13:12.340\n Birds flying high, you know how I feel.\n\n13:12.340 --> 13:17.340\n Then sun up in the sky, you know how I feel.\n\n13:18.740 --> 13:22.140\n That woman's voice, she doesn't give a damn yet.\n\n13:22.140 --> 13:22.980\n She's just.\n\n13:22.980 --> 13:26.300\n And I feel it, but then what's the, da dum, da dum.\n\n13:26.300 --> 13:28.140\n It's like heavy stripping music.\n\n13:28.140 --> 13:30.620\n It's, you're not in a good place.\n\n13:30.620 --> 13:33.180\n You're probably in some strip club,\n\n13:33.180 --> 13:34.460\n with the last of your money,\n\n13:34.460 --> 13:39.180\n you're drinking lousy beer, some bad situation.\n\n13:39.180 --> 13:40.380\n And she's feeling good?\n\n13:40.380 --> 13:41.660\n No, it's funereal.\n\n13:41.660 --> 13:43.540\n It's oppressive, right?\n\n13:43.540 --> 13:45.580\n I never thought of that song that way.\n\n13:45.580 --> 13:46.700\n Wow.\n\n13:46.700 --> 13:48.260\n Well, you think of it as joyous?\n\n13:48.260 --> 13:49.100\n Yeah.\n\n13:49.100 --> 13:50.140\n No, no, no, if you think about it,\n\n13:50.140 --> 13:53.220\n contrast it with Ray Charles, for example.\n\n13:53.220 --> 13:55.260\n You know, do you know Lonely Avenue?\n\n13:56.540 --> 14:00.060\n Well, my room has got two windows,\n\n14:00.060 --> 14:02.820\n but the sunshine never comes through.\n\n14:02.820 --> 14:04.300\n It's really depressed.\n\n14:04.300 --> 14:07.980\n It's the same sort of vibe as Nina,\n\n14:07.980 --> 14:09.780\n but she's claiming that she's in great shape.\n\n14:09.780 --> 14:13.340\n So she's like a good case of the unreliable narrator.\n\n14:13.340 --> 14:14.180\n Leonard Cohen, to me,\n\n14:14.180 --> 14:16.020\n is talking about the unreliable audience.\n\n14:16.020 --> 14:18.740\n That's too cool to be with the performer on stage.\n\n14:18.740 --> 14:20.020\n There are things that go with the music,\n\n14:20.020 --> 14:21.220\n like the Cole Porter stuff,\n\n14:21.220 --> 14:23.460\n there's go against like the Johnny Cash.\n\n14:23.460 --> 14:26.180\n I think these are the games that musicians play\n\n14:26.180 --> 14:29.260\n that the rest of us only sort of notice subliminally.\n\n14:30.180 --> 14:31.100\n Okay.\n\n14:31.100 --> 14:33.180\n Fourth, the fifth, then he,\n\n14:33.180 --> 14:36.020\n when he, he should say something about the relative minor\n\n14:36.020 --> 14:38.100\n or the, he's giving you the secret,\n\n14:38.100 --> 14:40.180\n the baffled king, in other words,\n\n14:40.180 --> 14:42.300\n he doesn't know why it works.\n\n14:42.300 --> 14:45.940\n Did Pachelbel know why Pachelbel's Canon would work?\n\n14:45.940 --> 14:47.100\n It was a discovery.\n\n14:47.100 --> 14:48.140\n That's the whole thing.\n\n14:48.140 --> 14:52.700\n Like some music is discovered and some music is invented.\n\n14:52.700 --> 14:56.260\n And he's talking about a musical discovery.\n\n14:56.260 --> 14:59.060\n He's talking about the Pythagorean power\n\n14:59.060 --> 15:01.980\n of the wave equation and then superimpose,\n\n15:01.980 --> 15:05.900\n like there's two genius intellectual concepts behind music.\n\n15:05.900 --> 15:07.900\n One of which is the wave equation.\n\n15:07.900 --> 15:09.940\n Usually we solve it for a one dimensional medium\n\n15:09.940 --> 15:11.940\n because we're talking about strings or air columns.\n\n15:11.940 --> 15:15.620\n Occasionally you're talking about things like handpans\n\n15:15.620 --> 15:19.180\n or steel drums or metallophones or gamelons, whatever.\n\n15:19.180 --> 15:21.740\n And those have a wave equation too,\n\n15:21.740 --> 15:23.740\n that's much more chaotic.\n\n15:23.740 --> 15:25.740\n The other equation is this crazy thing\n\n15:25.740 --> 15:29.780\n that two to the 19 twelfths is almost exactly equal to three,\n\n15:29.780 --> 15:31.900\n which is what gave us even temperament.\n\n15:31.900 --> 15:34.220\n And so the tension between those two things\n\n15:34.220 --> 15:37.780\n is in fact one of these most beautiful stories\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:39.260\n inside of that system.\n\n15:40.220 --> 15:43.220\n That formula of the baffled king is a discovery.\n\n15:43.220 --> 15:46.100\n It's not, he's not really composing it.\n\n15:46.100 --> 15:47.460\n The reason he's baffled,\n\n15:47.460 --> 15:50.660\n it's imagine that you took like a little brush\n\n15:50.660 --> 15:55.380\n and you started brushing off a pyramid under the sands.\n\n15:55.380 --> 15:57.660\n You might think that you created the pyramid\n\n15:57.660 --> 16:00.300\n by your brushing, but in fact, if somebody else did it,\n\n16:00.300 --> 16:02.860\n that's why you're baffled, right?\n\n16:02.860 --> 16:04.140\n That's beautifully put, you're right.\n\n16:04.140 --> 16:07.940\n And as creating one of the greatest songs of all time\n\n16:07.940 --> 16:10.380\n and as he's doing it, he's baffled.\n\n16:10.380 --> 16:13.260\n And he's within the song.\n\n16:13.260 --> 16:15.660\n And he Leonard is baffled is my contention,\n\n16:15.660 --> 16:19.180\n but he knows enough to know that he's baffled, right?\n\n16:19.180 --> 16:20.940\n And so the idea is that he is composing,\n\n16:20.940 --> 16:25.940\n he has the audacity to compose as David.\n\n16:27.620 --> 16:29.580\n He's echoing David at a minimum.\n\n16:30.580 --> 16:31.660\n And then in a later song,\n\n16:31.660 --> 16:32.980\n which I really wish we would discuss,\n\n16:32.980 --> 16:36.500\n that's totally dystopic and you will not like it at all,\n\n16:36.500 --> 16:39.940\n is the future, which contains this line\n\n16:39.940 --> 16:41.980\n that I think I used in my episode\n\n16:41.980 --> 16:44.500\n with Roger Penrose on the portal.\n\n16:44.500 --> 16:45.940\n Note the subtle plug.\n\n16:45.940 --> 16:49.820\n The portal, the portal, the portal, the portal.\n\n16:49.820 --> 16:51.940\n I'm the little Jew that wrote the Bible.\n\n16:51.940 --> 16:54.100\n So there is this way in which Leonard Cohen,\n\n16:54.100 --> 16:56.420\n I think is constantly coming to the idea\n\n16:56.420 --> 16:59.940\n of being a biblical like scribe.\n\n16:59.940 --> 17:01.500\n And I think this is one of the great things\n\n17:01.500 --> 17:04.460\n that you see Dylan doing this with all along the watchtower.\n\n17:04.460 --> 17:07.860\n You saw Warren Zevon, who we should talk much more about,\n\n17:07.860 --> 17:10.140\n doing this with a song called I Was in the House\n\n17:10.140 --> 17:11.180\n When the House Burned Down.\n\n17:11.180 --> 17:12.380\n Do you know this thing?\n\n17:12.380 --> 17:13.220\n No.\n\n17:13.220 --> 17:14.040\n This is embarrassing.\n\n17:14.040 --> 17:14.880\n Sweetheart.\n\n17:14.880 --> 17:16.500\n This is a great day.\n\n17:16.500 --> 17:19.340\n Warren Zevon is one of the most important songwriters\n\n17:19.340 --> 17:20.180\n of our time.\n\n17:20.180 --> 17:25.180\n And he's been largely forgotten by this generation.\n\n17:26.540 --> 17:29.820\n But Bob Dylan would sing one of his songs in tribute.\n\n17:29.820 --> 17:33.020\n I've heard Bob Dylan, you know,\n\n17:33.020 --> 17:35.220\n very small number of songwriters really move him.\n\n17:35.220 --> 17:40.220\n Woody Guthrie, Gordon Lightfoot, and Warren Zevon.\n\n17:40.580 --> 17:43.020\n By the way, Bob Dylan, if you're out there,\n\n17:43.020 --> 17:45.280\n appear on either one of our podcasts.\n\n17:45.280 --> 17:47.300\n We need to get your voice into a new medium\n\n17:47.300 --> 17:48.580\n for a new group.\n\n17:48.580 --> 17:49.420\n Definitely.\n\n17:49.420 --> 17:51.500\n This is a time for Bob Dylan, my friend.\n\n17:52.780 --> 17:55.700\n Honestly, you've been doing an amazing job in this space.\n\n17:55.700 --> 17:57.940\n One of the reasons I'm super excited to do this podcast\n\n17:57.940 --> 18:01.700\n again is that I've learned some things\n\n18:01.700 --> 18:03.220\n about what I don't do well.\n\n18:03.220 --> 18:07.200\n And I also have sort of struggled with the question,\n\n18:07.200 --> 18:08.700\n should I do those things better?\n\n18:08.700 --> 18:10.460\n Because what if it's, you know,\n\n18:10.460 --> 18:12.540\n I always use the same example of the fitted sheet\n\n18:12.540 --> 18:14.740\n when you're trying to put a queen size fitted sheet\n\n18:14.740 --> 18:15.980\n on a king size mattress.\n\n18:15.980 --> 18:17.740\n He's like, okay, I got that corner squared away.\n\n18:17.740 --> 18:19.340\n Then you get another corner that pops off\n\n18:19.340 --> 18:21.280\n and they have to go back around.\n\n18:21.280 --> 18:24.780\n I wonder whether I can improve my style in the ways in which,\n\n18:24.780 --> 18:28.860\n you know, I think it's just a recognition of a difference.\n\n18:28.860 --> 18:32.060\n You do a better job of getting to the soul\n\n18:32.060 --> 18:35.420\n of a really top intellectual guest\n\n18:35.420 --> 18:38.820\n and making them accessible and presenting them\n\n18:38.820 --> 18:42.300\n as themselves for a huge number of people.\n\n18:42.300 --> 18:45.260\n And I'd give my eye tooth to be able to do that.\n\n18:45.260 --> 18:46.940\n Do you ever think about this?\n\n18:46.940 --> 18:50.100\n Like, cause I think about what is the greatest\n\n18:50.100 --> 18:52.500\n conversation I'll ever have.\n\n18:52.500 --> 18:55.660\n You know, like in a sense of the portal,\n\n18:55.660 --> 18:57.660\n not to reduce it to anything,\n\n18:57.660 --> 19:00.820\n but there will be the greatest conversation.\n\n19:00.820 --> 19:03.660\n You may have already had it, but it's very possible.\n\n19:03.660 --> 19:07.260\n If enough people like me can keep twisting your arm\n\n19:07.260 --> 19:09.140\n to keep doing the portal, please,\n\n19:09.140 --> 19:12.060\n that is, there'll be an amazing conversation.\n\n19:12.060 --> 19:16.020\n One of the questions that I ask myself is like,\n\n19:16.020 --> 19:20.420\n who is the person that I'm especially equipped?\n\n19:20.420 --> 19:23.040\n For some reason, I'm convinced on Putin.\n\n19:23.040 --> 19:25.180\n There's something in my head that says,\n\n19:25.180 --> 19:30.060\n I can do this man better than anyone else in this world.\n\n19:30.060 --> 19:32.820\n I got this thought in my head about it, I don't know why.\n\n19:32.820 --> 19:34.860\n And I'm convinced, but I think the universe works\n\n19:34.860 --> 19:35.700\n in that way.\n\n19:35.700 --> 19:38.140\n Like if it tells you, it's gonna happen.\n\n19:38.140 --> 19:40.600\n The way I would say it is, is that almost everybody\n\n19:40.600 --> 19:43.700\n who becomes a Supreme Court justice believes\n\n19:43.700 --> 19:45.620\n at a very early age, they're going to become\n\n19:45.620 --> 19:46.500\n a Supreme Court justice.\n\n19:46.500 --> 19:48.740\n Many people believe at an early age that they can do it,\n\n19:48.740 --> 19:49.820\n don't get there.\n\n19:49.820 --> 19:52.000\n But of those who get there, almost all of them\n\n19:52.000 --> 19:55.700\n had this sort of, well, I call it pathological\n\n19:55.700 --> 19:56.940\n self confidence.\n\n19:56.940 --> 20:01.040\n And I do think you have pathological self confidence\n\n20:01.040 --> 20:02.540\n and you also have humility.\n\n20:02.540 --> 20:05.600\n And most people would hear those as a contradiction.\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:07.460\n I think that you would not be able to get away\n\n20:07.460 --> 20:11.880\n with what you do if you didn't have the humility.\n\n20:11.880 --> 20:15.500\n And so I think the great danger is that your equation\n\n20:15.500 --> 20:18.740\n becomes unbalanced, that you either lose the humility\n\n20:18.740 --> 20:23.740\n or you lose the humility overwhelms the ego and the drive.\n\n20:24.020 --> 20:26.100\n Because right now you've got a Mexican standoff\n\n20:26.100 --> 20:28.540\n in your mind and the rest of us are just benefiting.\n\n20:28.540 --> 20:29.680\n That's beautifully put.\n\n20:29.680 --> 20:32.180\n My Mexican standoffs aren't as stable as yours.\n\n20:32.180 --> 20:35.280\n It's all reservoir dogs all the time.\n\n20:36.140 --> 20:39.820\n But actually the person who that describes is Peter Thiel.\n\n20:39.820 --> 20:42.260\n Peter Thiel thinks more, people always say like,\n\n20:42.260 --> 20:44.260\n what does Peter think about X, Y, and Z, P, and Q?\n\n20:44.260 --> 20:46.220\n It's like, well, do you want communist Peter?\n\n20:46.220 --> 20:47.700\n Do you want hyper capitalist Peter?\n\n20:47.700 --> 20:50.020\n He's got all these minds in there, oh my God, right?\n\n20:50.020 --> 20:50.860\n On everything.\n\n20:50.860 --> 20:52.900\n That's why he's successful is that he's got all these minds\n\n20:52.900 --> 20:53.740\n fighting each other.\n\n20:53.740 --> 20:56.100\n And so when people say Peter is this or Peter is that,\n\n20:56.100 --> 20:59.940\n I just laugh because like nobody who knows him\n\n20:59.940 --> 21:02.940\n would describe him as having thoughts at the level\n\n21:02.940 --> 21:04.520\n that people are claiming.\n\n21:04.520 --> 21:07.160\n And I do think that in my case,\n\n21:12.200 --> 21:14.820\n there's also pathological epistemic humility.\n\n21:14.820 --> 21:19.820\n Like just, I know how little I can do in one life.\n\n21:20.580 --> 21:22.700\n I know how many things I've screwed up.\n\n21:22.700 --> 21:25.180\n I know how many things I've got wrong.\n\n21:25.180 --> 21:28.380\n And on the other hand, I know that if not,\n\n21:28.380 --> 21:30.100\n it's like Hillel's questions,\n\n21:30.100 --> 21:32.340\n if I'm not for myself, who will be for me?\n\n21:32.340 --> 21:34.100\n And if I'm only for myself, what am I?\n\n21:34.100 --> 21:35.180\n If not now, when?\n\n21:36.900 --> 21:38.860\n At some level, there's a question about\n\n21:39.980 --> 21:43.140\n if I don't decide that someone is capable\n\n21:43.140 --> 21:45.220\n and that that somebody is me.\n\n21:45.220 --> 21:49.100\n And if I apply that to everyone else on the planet,\n\n21:49.100 --> 21:50.460\n then nobody's gonna do anything.\n\n21:50.460 --> 21:52.580\n And so I do think that one of the things\n\n21:52.580 --> 21:56.040\n that people like you and I get is who are you to say that?\n\n21:57.500 --> 22:02.340\n F that, man, just sign me up for some Dunning Kruger.\n\n22:03.940 --> 22:06.880\n Yeah, but it's multiple minds like you said.\n\n22:06.880 --> 22:09.980\n Like this morning, I was feeling so good and confident\n\n22:09.980 --> 22:12.280\n about I couldn't think no wrong.\n\n22:12.280 --> 22:14.260\n And I remember last night clearly thinking\n\n22:14.260 --> 22:16.780\n that I'm the dumbest human who's ever lived\n\n22:16.780 --> 22:19.700\n and nothing I've ever said is worth anything.\n\n22:19.700 --> 22:22.560\n What the fuck am I doing with my life?\n\n22:22.560 --> 22:23.760\n Why am I scared?\n\n22:23.760 --> 22:26.340\n I was terrified of this conversation.\n\n22:26.340 --> 22:27.180\n Who the hell am I?\n\n22:27.180 --> 22:28.020\n This conversation?\n\n22:28.020 --> 22:29.300\n Because I'm an idiot.\n\n22:29.300 --> 22:34.140\n And because, you know, Lex, but no, no, no, no.\n\n22:34.140 --> 22:38.300\n But this morning, I was the baddest motherfucker\n\n22:38.300 --> 22:39.420\n who's ever walked this earth.\n\n22:39.420 --> 22:41.780\n So I was very conscious.\n\n22:41.780 --> 22:44.340\n I think it was the coffee, I'm not sure, maybe some sleep.\n\n22:44.340 --> 22:47.140\n This sounds very Russian and it involves multiple beverages,\n\n22:47.140 --> 22:49.960\n some of them being alcoholic, others containing caffeine.\n\n22:49.960 --> 22:53.620\n There's, in fact, I can't share the story behind it,\n\n22:53.620 --> 22:56.180\n but there is a bottle of vodka in the fridge.\n\n22:56.180 --> 22:57.660\n Okay.\n\n22:57.660 --> 23:00.140\n So, I mean, I should have hit you for coffee\n\n23:00.140 --> 23:02.580\n because this is a morning show here.\n\n23:02.580 --> 23:05.020\n So I put out a call that we get a chance\n\n23:05.020 --> 23:06.180\n to have this conversation\n\n23:06.180 --> 23:08.500\n and people ask these wonderful questions.\n\n23:08.500 --> 23:13.400\n A few people asked about depression and suicide.\n\n23:16.020 --> 23:19.260\n This is a Russian program, so we have to go there.\n\n23:19.260 --> 23:20.980\n And I think about Leonard Cohen\n\n23:20.980 --> 23:25.980\n and one of the things that always kind of broke my heart\n\n23:28.620 --> 23:31.540\n and kind of suffocated the hope I have for just,\n\n23:33.820 --> 23:36.780\n I don't know, for love in a person's life\n\n23:36.780 --> 23:39.900\n is to hear how much depression was a part\n\n23:39.900 --> 23:42.900\n of Leonard Cohen's life and how much he suffered.\n\n23:44.460 --> 23:47.260\n I guess one way, I'm not sure where we can go\n\n23:47.260 --> 23:50.580\n with this question, but do you think about the places\n\n23:50.580 --> 23:54.260\n that the mind can go, like these dark places?\n\n23:54.260 --> 23:55.420\n Yeah.\n\n23:55.420 --> 24:00.120\n Is there something like where the only escape out\n\n24:00.120 --> 24:02.920\n is suicide, for example, that's the darkest version of it?\n\n24:02.920 --> 24:07.380\n That, I really think suicide is a big place\n\n24:07.380 --> 24:09.900\n in suicidal ideation and self harm\n\n24:09.900 --> 24:12.460\n and we don't talk a lot about it.\n\n24:14.180 --> 24:17.300\n It's a similar problem to trying to talk about trans.\n\n24:17.300 --> 24:19.260\n These are umbrella categories.\n\n24:19.260 --> 24:23.380\n And if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves,\n\n24:23.380 --> 24:25.660\n but we don't know whether that's coming\n\n24:25.660 --> 24:28.000\n because of a problem in brain chemistry,\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.060\n because of an event in their life,\n\n24:30.060 --> 24:34.500\n whether evolutionary programming for suicide\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:37.580\n is weirdly normal, whether or not\n\n24:37.580 --> 24:40.420\n it might have a religious motivation.\n\n24:40.420 --> 24:43.620\n There's too many different forms of self harm.\n\n24:43.620 --> 24:47.260\n It's something like the 10th largest killer thereabouts.\n\n24:49.780 --> 24:53.380\n And I think that you can look at it from different angles.\n\n24:53.380 --> 24:58.380\n I'm old enough to have had Pete Seeger come to my college\n\n24:58.380 --> 25:03.380\n when I was at university and to watch his good humor\n\n25:04.300 --> 25:06.180\n in the face of all adversity.\n\n25:07.820 --> 25:10.900\n I think of Odetta, I used to go to Odetta concerts.\n\n25:10.900 --> 25:13.340\n I don't know if you know who she is.\n\n25:13.340 --> 25:15.340\n Okay, this is gonna be one of the better days of your life.\n\n25:15.340 --> 25:17.980\n Check out Odetta when we're done with the interview.\n\n25:19.180 --> 25:20.980\n She was a civil rights figure,\n\n25:20.980 --> 25:25.980\n but also just had a profound voice and great musicianship.\n\n25:25.980 --> 25:29.360\n These people were in the struggle, right?\n\n25:29.360 --> 25:32.880\n And they saw lots of bad things happen\n\n25:32.880 --> 25:34.960\n and they kept their humor about them.\n\n25:34.960 --> 25:39.960\n And the thing is that you can take on the Weltschmerz,\n\n25:41.760 --> 25:43.600\n the pain of the planet,\n\n25:43.600 --> 25:46.520\n or you can try to do something else,\n\n25:46.520 --> 25:48.240\n which is to be a happy warrior,\n\n25:48.240 --> 25:51.520\n even if the odds are terrible\n\n25:51.520 --> 25:55.200\n and the cost of failure is catastrophic.\n\n25:55.200 --> 25:58.400\n So even when surrounded by darkness.\n\n25:58.400 --> 26:00.380\n But the thing is with Leonard Cohen\n\n26:00.380 --> 26:02.720\n is he created such beautiful music.\n\n26:03.600 --> 26:07.260\n And yet it's like Anthony Bourdain, the same.\n\n26:08.140 --> 26:11.400\n And yet they go to this dark place.\n\n26:11.400 --> 26:15.400\n And it could be, it's easy to say it's just biochemistry.\n\n26:16.720 --> 26:19.300\n There's a linkage between this highly generative,\n\n26:19.300 --> 26:23.520\n creative side and in some cases,\n\n26:23.520 --> 26:26.860\n dark depression, in other cases, not.\n\n26:26.860 --> 26:29.400\n So you can't say that it's tied,\n\n26:29.400 --> 26:32.180\n the genius and madness are always co traveling\n\n26:32.180 --> 26:35.580\n or the beauty and pain are one in the same.\n\n26:35.580 --> 26:38.380\n What you can say is that there's a cluster of people\n\n26:38.380 --> 26:40.260\n that tell you that for that cluster,\n\n26:40.260 --> 26:43.660\n there is a relationship between the darkness and the beauty.\n\n26:43.660 --> 26:45.460\n And I do think that in part,\n\n26:45.460 --> 26:47.960\n it's squaring circles that can't be squared.\n\n26:47.960 --> 26:52.960\n We were just talking before about the inability\n\n26:54.760 --> 26:56.560\n to serve two perfect systems,\n\n26:56.560 --> 26:58.800\n the perfect system of the wave equation\n\n26:58.800 --> 27:01.240\n and the perfect system of even temperament.\n\n27:01.240 --> 27:03.600\n They're both perfect, they're not compatible.\n\n27:05.320 --> 27:07.920\n And once you realize that there is perfection\n\n27:07.920 --> 27:11.060\n and an inability to make contact with perfection,\n\n27:11.060 --> 27:16.060\n I think you recognize that there is no solution\n\n27:20.720 --> 27:21.560\n to this world.\n\n27:23.080 --> 27:26.880\n Yeah, that's weird with the poets and musicians.\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:29.840\n Do you want to say this is a particular thing that you do,\n\n27:29.840 --> 27:32.080\n but then there's Spanish fly by Van Halen.\n\n27:33.040 --> 27:34.960\n And then you realize, oh, well,\n\n27:34.960 --> 27:37.920\n what do you get out of Spanish fly by Van Halen?\n\n27:37.920 --> 27:40.640\n I think it's very singular because of the fact\n\n27:40.640 --> 27:42.260\n that it's purely acoustic.\n\n27:42.260 --> 27:44.280\n For some reason, I always,\n\n27:44.280 --> 27:47.640\n I couldn't imagine Eddie Van Halen separate from the band\n\n27:47.640 --> 27:51.080\n in front of thousands of people just screaming\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:53.440\n and rocking out with lights everywhere.\n\n27:53.440 --> 27:55.880\n And Spanish fly made me think like,\n\n27:55.880 --> 27:57.680\n it made me imagine him sitting alone\n\n27:57.680 --> 27:58.520\n on a couch in a room.\n\n27:58.520 --> 28:00.560\n I think that's who he was, I really do.\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:03.320\n I mean, believe me, I get it.\n\n28:03.320 --> 28:04.620\n He was a rockstar, he was a rock god.\n\n28:04.620 --> 28:06.120\n Got it, got it, got it, got it.\n\n28:07.240 --> 28:10.080\n I'm almost positive that you can't get\n\n28:10.080 --> 28:13.400\n to where he got to without being a complete introvert.\n\n28:13.400 --> 28:14.840\n Yeah, it made me imagine\n\n28:14.840 --> 28:19.840\n that there's some half naked supermodel walking around,\n\n28:20.000 --> 28:24.440\n hoping that they can do their thing together.\n\n28:24.440 --> 28:26.220\n And Eddie's completely disinterested.\n\n28:26.220 --> 28:27.060\n He'd be with the guitar.\n\n28:27.060 --> 28:28.360\n He'd be with the guitar, right?\n\n28:28.360 --> 28:29.200\n Yeah.\n\n28:29.200 --> 28:31.960\n Because honestly, at some level,\n\n28:31.960 --> 28:35.040\n in one case, maybe you're conquesting,\n\n28:35.040 --> 28:37.120\n maybe you're pursuing love and romance.\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:39.920\n In the other case, you're talking about a relationship\n\n28:39.920 --> 28:42.960\n to the order, the creator, the almighty,\n\n28:42.960 --> 28:44.800\n whatever it is you want to call that substrate\n\n28:44.800 --> 28:46.740\n that is reality.\n\n28:46.740 --> 28:51.200\n And do I believe that Eddie Van Halen\n\n28:51.200 --> 28:53.860\n and Jimi Hendrix and Paganini and Heifetz\n\n28:53.860 --> 28:56.480\n jacked into the true essence of the world?\n\n28:56.480 --> 28:57.720\n Yeah, they did.\n\n28:57.720 --> 29:00.640\n I don't think it's as good as differential geometry.\n\n29:00.640 --> 29:01.680\n I'm sorry.\n\n29:01.680 --> 29:05.800\n I do think it's amazing for other reasons.\n\n29:05.800 --> 29:07.960\n And thank God, because it's very typical\n\n29:07.960 --> 29:10.320\n to communicate differential geometry at scale.\n\n29:10.320 --> 29:13.140\n But the thing about eruption, for example,\n\n29:13.140 --> 29:15.320\n what level do you want to come into eruption?\n\n29:15.320 --> 29:18.200\n Do you want just the sheer majesty and pageantry?\n\n29:18.200 --> 29:20.020\n Do you want the theatrics?\n\n29:20.020 --> 29:21.880\n Like you could put him on wires\n\n29:21.880 --> 29:24.880\n and set his pants on fire or whatever,\n\n29:24.880 --> 29:27.460\n and it'd be totally in keeping with it.\n\n29:27.460 --> 29:28.300\n On the other hand, you want to talk\n\n29:28.300 --> 29:29.960\n to something completely precise\n\n29:31.400 --> 29:33.640\n that shows off the virtuosity\n\n29:33.640 --> 29:36.400\n of what's possible with the Stratocaster.\n\n29:36.400 --> 29:38.160\n Everything works.\n\n29:38.160 --> 29:39.000\n Multi axis.\n\n29:39.000 --> 29:40.840\n But there's a precision to it,\n\n29:40.840 --> 29:44.040\n which is very different than Hendrix.\n\n29:44.040 --> 29:46.040\n There's a messiness to Hendrix that to me,\n\n29:46.040 --> 29:49.360\n somebody who has OCD has always been a struggle.\n\n29:49.360 --> 29:50.640\n How does Hendrix affect you?\n\n29:50.640 --> 29:52.600\n I mean, let's have the Jimi Hendrix conversation.\n\n29:52.600 --> 29:53.840\n I don't know that we can do anything to it\n\n29:53.840 --> 29:56.120\n that hasn't already been done to it.\n\n29:56.120 --> 29:56.960\n Maybe that's not true.\n\n29:56.960 --> 29:58.960\n Maybe the idea is that every generation\n\n29:58.960 --> 30:01.280\n has to have its Hendrix conversation,\n\n30:01.280 --> 30:02.120\n and this is a long form part.\n\n30:02.120 --> 30:03.600\n It's Jimi Hendrix experience.\n\n30:03.600 --> 30:04.440\n Yeah.\n\n30:04.440 --> 30:05.760\n Yeah, so funny.\n\n30:05.760 --> 30:07.240\n I hear you stole it from Joe Rogan.\n\n30:07.240 --> 30:08.080\n Yeah.\n\n30:10.020 --> 30:11.520\n There's so many details.\n\n30:11.520 --> 30:16.520\n One, it hurt my soul on so many levels\n\n30:17.140 --> 30:20.120\n that you can put a thumb over the guitar\n\n30:20.120 --> 30:23.480\n to play a note, to hold the note.\n\n30:23.480 --> 30:27.700\n And it doesn't, because I want it to be the Russian virtuoso\n\n30:27.700 --> 30:30.960\n that sits with his classical guitar in a perfect form,\n\n30:30.960 --> 30:32.720\n plays really fast with the fingers,\n\n30:32.720 --> 30:36.240\n and then you want the thumb to be perfectly relaxed\n\n30:36.240 --> 30:37.080\n and supporting the neck.\n\n30:37.080 --> 30:39.000\n So that's the Russian conservatory student.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:40.640\n Conservatory student, yeah.\n\n30:40.640 --> 30:43.340\n Then there's the Russian wild man.\n\n30:43.340 --> 30:44.180\n Which one is that?\n\n30:44.180 --> 30:47.560\n Well, they're different Russian archetypes, right?\n\n30:47.560 --> 30:50.440\n So the completely idiosyncratic Russian\n\n30:50.440 --> 30:53.560\n is very different in a weird way from the,\n\n30:55.480 --> 30:58.540\n I can do this backwards in any key in my sleep\n\n30:58.540 --> 31:03.040\n and in any time signature that you just snap your fingers.\n\n31:03.040 --> 31:08.040\n We've discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes.\n\n31:08.600 --> 31:10.480\n No, no, that was offline conversation.\n\n31:10.480 --> 31:11.640\n You told me the story.\n\n31:11.640 --> 31:13.120\n I should tell you the story.\n\n31:13.120 --> 31:14.440\n You should retell the story.\n\n31:14.440 --> 31:16.840\n There I was in darkest Manhattan\n\n31:16.840 --> 31:19.960\n with the world's shittiest, it wasn't even an upright,\n\n31:19.960 --> 31:21.760\n it was a spinet piano.\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:23.560\n A friend had given it to me.\n\n31:23.560 --> 31:27.480\n The piano fell out of tune and I would have to tune it.\n\n31:27.480 --> 31:29.920\n And the only tuner I knew was this Russian guy\n\n31:29.920 --> 31:31.520\n and I hated dealing with him.\n\n31:31.520 --> 31:32.840\n There was something about his attitude\n\n31:32.840 --> 31:35.160\n that just really rubbed me the wrong way.\n\n31:35.160 --> 31:37.320\n So anyway, my wife says, tune that thing.\n\n31:37.320 --> 31:40.600\n So we get the piano tuner to come and he's tuning this.\n\n31:40.600 --> 31:44.280\n He's like, are you sure you wanna tune this piece of shit?\n\n31:44.280 --> 31:45.440\n Okay, fine.\n\n31:45.440 --> 31:47.240\n So he's like, okay, it's your money.\n\n31:48.320 --> 31:51.840\n The phone rings and I have the phone ringer set\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:55.400\n on a landline to Paganini Caprice 24.\n\n31:55.400 --> 31:58.440\n And immediately as the phone rings,\n\n31:58.440 --> 32:02.000\n he figures out what key the phone ringer is\n\n32:02.000 --> 32:05.560\n and which is not the key that like list composed\n\n32:05.560 --> 32:09.160\n the variations on Caprice 24.\n\n32:09.160 --> 32:11.480\n And he starts going into theme and variations\n\n32:11.480 --> 32:14.840\n on Caprice 24 at some level I've never heard before,\n\n32:14.840 --> 32:17.100\n just jaw dropping it.\n\n32:17.100 --> 32:18.960\n And like the phone stops ringing\n\n32:18.960 --> 32:20.600\n and we have this awkward silence.\n\n32:20.600 --> 32:23.480\n I said, I didn't know you were such a great piano player.\n\n32:23.480 --> 32:24.960\n And then he says one of these things\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:28.280\n in Russian accented English hurts in a way\n\n32:28.280 --> 32:29.120\n you can't imagine.\n\n32:29.120 --> 32:31.960\n He said, no, you are the piano player.\n\n32:31.960 --> 32:33.960\n I am merely the piano tuner.\n\n32:33.960 --> 32:38.480\n And I was just like, oh man, through the heart.\n\n32:38.480 --> 32:40.080\n You know, it's kind of reminiscent.\n\n32:40.080 --> 32:41.400\n I'd love to hear actually your opinion.\n\n32:41.400 --> 32:44.160\n This is reminiscent of the Good Will Hunting story.\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:45.760\n What do you think about that?\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:46.600\n That movie?\n\n32:46.600 --> 32:47.440\n That movie.\n\n32:47.440 --> 32:48.260\n What about it?\n\n32:48.260 --> 32:49.100\n It's MIT.\n\n32:49.100 --> 32:51.600\n Yeah, I guess when I think of that film,\n\n32:51.600 --> 32:55.180\n I think about Matt Damon as a young guy,\n\n32:56.220 --> 33:00.120\n risking everything, giving up Harvard.\n\n33:00.120 --> 33:02.360\n I think probably the most accomplished group\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:03.720\n of people in the world are people\n\n33:03.720 --> 33:05.880\n who choose to give up Harvard voluntarily.\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:08.400\n Beautiful, right?\n\n33:08.400 --> 33:09.220\n That's true.\n\n33:09.220 --> 33:10.060\n Bigger than Harvard.\n\n33:10.060 --> 33:10.880\n That's very true.\n\n33:10.880 --> 33:14.660\n Ives was one of these people, Bill Gates, of course.\n\n33:18.160 --> 33:19.680\n And then oddly, you know.\n\n33:19.680 --> 33:20.520\n Zuckerberg.\n\n33:20.520 --> 33:21.340\n What?\n\n33:21.340 --> 33:24.560\n But then Steve Jobs gave up a Reed,\n\n33:24.560 --> 33:26.880\n and Reed is like the weirdest, craziest college\n\n33:26.880 --> 33:27.720\n in the world.\n\n33:27.720 --> 33:29.200\n People should pay much more attention to Reed.\n\n33:29.200 --> 33:31.800\n And I'm sorry it's going through a hard time at the moment,\n\n33:31.800 --> 33:33.880\n but what it was before the current craziness\n\n33:33.880 --> 33:36.020\n is really an interesting story.\n\n33:36.020 --> 33:38.840\n Irregardless, as we say in the 617 Area Code,\n\n33:40.840 --> 33:43.720\n I think that a lot of my reaction\n\n33:43.720 --> 33:47.240\n is to the real story of Matt Damon having this vision\n\n33:47.240 --> 33:49.900\n and being the young guy to pull it off.\n\n33:49.900 --> 33:52.480\n And I also think about Robin Williams\n\n33:52.480 --> 33:57.480\n trying to explore heart through this lens of acting.\n\n33:58.160 --> 34:03.040\n And as you and I, you've hung out with comedians.\n\n34:04.040 --> 34:07.640\n They know that they already screwed up a bunch of people.\n\n34:07.640 --> 34:08.460\n They do.\n\n34:08.460 --> 34:10.160\n They're proud about it.\n\n34:10.160 --> 34:11.760\n They really are.\n\n34:11.760 --> 34:14.320\n The idea that Robin Williams, who I saw many years ago\n\n34:14.320 --> 34:17.960\n when I was in LA in the comedy clubs around here,\n\n34:17.960 --> 34:21.880\n he was a straight up crazy, dysregulated genius\n\n34:21.880 --> 34:23.460\n in tremendous pain.\n\n34:25.080 --> 34:28.880\n And his desire to do it earnestly through acting\n\n34:28.880 --> 34:32.480\n rather than constantly by just sniping\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:37.480\n or being a clown or showing us how fast his mind worked\n\n34:37.960 --> 34:42.280\n relative to ours, I was really moved by that.\n\n34:42.280 --> 34:45.760\n I thought that he brought some authenticity\n\n34:45.760 --> 34:48.400\n and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that real.\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:52.440\n And again, like you said, it doesn't always have to be,\n\n34:52.440 --> 34:56.360\n but in that case, the madness and the genius were neighbors.\n\n34:56.360 --> 34:58.560\n That one couldn't have been any other way.\n\n34:58.560 --> 34:59.400\n Yeah.\n\n34:59.400 --> 35:01.240\n No, because his mind,\n\n35:01.240 --> 35:04.080\n the thing about seeing him in a comedy club\n\n35:04.080 --> 35:07.240\n was that he would react to random stimulus\n\n35:07.240 --> 35:08.880\n in the environment.\n\n35:08.880 --> 35:09.720\n You know, it could be a heckler.\n\n35:09.720 --> 35:10.880\n Sometimes you almost got the feeling\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:11.920\n that he wanted a heckler\n\n35:11.920 --> 35:16.840\n because it gave him something to play against, right?\n\n35:16.840 --> 35:20.700\n He was infinitely, instantly inventive.\n\n35:20.700 --> 35:24.300\n But I actually, to me, the best Robin Williams\n\n35:24.300 --> 35:27.960\n is as he got closer and closer to the end of his life\n\n35:27.960 --> 35:30.240\n because there was a sadness\n\n35:30.240 --> 35:33.520\n and he's almost fighting the sadness\n\n35:33.520 --> 35:36.200\n with this improvisational,\n\n35:36.200 --> 35:40.320\n like the weapons he has is this wit and humor\n\n35:40.320 --> 35:42.800\n and this dancing that he does with language.\n\n35:42.800 --> 35:46.120\n But, and then sometimes when you just fall silent,\n\n35:46.120 --> 35:48.320\n you can see the sadness.\n\n35:48.320 --> 35:51.560\n And I don't know, there's something so beautiful about that.\n\n35:51.560 --> 35:53.200\n It's like this bird with a broken wing\n\n35:53.200 --> 35:55.440\n that's like trying to fly, you know,\n\n35:55.440 --> 35:56.940\n and it's getting older and older.\n\n35:56.940 --> 35:59.960\n And I mean, those,\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:03.240\n he would have made a one hell of a podcast guest,\n\n36:03.240 --> 36:04.600\n I'll tell you that.\n\n36:04.600 --> 36:05.840\n That's a sad.\n\n36:05.840 --> 36:07.980\n Yeah, I have some sadness that I really do think\n\n36:07.980 --> 36:11.000\n that part of what we call podcasting\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.480\n is actually just getting to know a soul\n\n36:13.480 --> 36:14.720\n over and over again.\n\n36:14.720 --> 36:19.720\n Like maybe the idea is that this is talking about depression\n\n36:20.760 --> 36:25.160\n and sadness and heavy feelings\n\n36:25.160 --> 36:27.060\n is not an American specialty.\n\n36:28.800 --> 36:31.360\n Seeing that in context with the beauty of life\n\n36:31.360 --> 36:33.040\n is a Russian specialty.\n\n36:33.040 --> 36:34.980\n Like it is very much.\n\n36:34.980 --> 36:38.000\n Russian specialty, sounds like a diner menu.\n\n36:38.000 --> 36:38.840\n What?\n\n36:38.840 --> 36:39.680\n Yeah.\n\n36:39.680 --> 36:40.520\n You want the Russian specialty?\n\n36:40.520 --> 36:45.520\n A big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression.\n\n36:46.640 --> 36:49.360\n I do think that we're in a really terrifying\n\n36:49.360 --> 36:51.520\n and depressing time.\n\n36:51.520 --> 36:54.560\n And I think that part of it is that we don't know\n\n36:54.560 --> 36:57.320\n if something huge is about to get started.\n\n36:57.320 --> 36:59.280\n And we don't even know what this is.\n\n36:59.280 --> 37:01.920\n I mean, we just sit here in this weird world\n\n37:01.920 --> 37:04.480\n that is falling into some new state\n\n37:04.480 --> 37:06.360\n and we're not even super curious.\n\n37:06.360 --> 37:08.720\n It's like, what the hell just happened?\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:09.920\n Everybody's got an answer.\n\n37:09.920 --> 37:13.400\n And I'm positive that all of those answers are wrong.\n\n37:13.400 --> 37:17.440\n Let's try to at least sneak up on the good answer.\n\n37:17.440 --> 37:20.160\n So the central core of the answer is\n\n37:20.160 --> 37:24.180\n that the US seemed to be the greatest thing in the world\n\n37:24.180 --> 37:26.540\n in large measure because we hadn't noticed\n\n37:27.520 --> 37:30.720\n that we were getting a benefit from having no plan,\n\n37:30.720 --> 37:33.320\n not having to make a plan for low growth.\n\n37:33.320 --> 37:38.040\n As long as we had growth, we were in great shape.\n\n37:38.040 --> 37:42.860\n Let's imagine that you could run an experiment,\n\n37:42.860 --> 37:44.560\n you have a billion copies of Earth\n\n37:44.560 --> 37:47.320\n and you start the initial conditions slightly different.\n\n37:48.280 --> 37:50.800\n On some giant number of planets,\n\n37:50.800 --> 37:54.640\n a lot of the things that were discovered\n\n37:54.640 --> 37:58.840\n from the 1800s through the end of the 20th century\n\n37:58.840 --> 38:01.500\n are discovered in a period of time\n\n38:01.500 --> 38:03.940\n because a lot of that just has to do with\n\n38:03.940 --> 38:06.860\n once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments,\n\n38:06.860 --> 38:08.100\n you can see more.\n\n38:08.100 --> 38:09.160\n And the more you can see,\n\n38:09.160 --> 38:11.100\n the more you can make use of what you can see.\n\n38:11.100 --> 38:13.880\n And it turns out there was lots of stuff to do\n\n38:13.880 --> 38:18.880\n with like germs or electron orbitals\n\n38:19.520 --> 38:22.960\n or spectrum, electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n38:22.960 --> 38:25.400\n And so we got to do all of those things\n\n38:25.400 --> 38:27.360\n and the US roughly corresponded\n\n38:27.360 --> 38:30.520\n for a good chunk of its history with this bonanza.\n\n38:30.520 --> 38:34.200\n And so of course we look like an amazing genius country.\n\n38:34.200 --> 38:35.820\n We have no plan.\n\n38:35.820 --> 38:37.440\n Imagine that you could sell a car,\n\n38:37.440 --> 38:38.720\n you don't have to put in seat belts,\n\n38:38.720 --> 38:40.720\n you don't have to put in airbags,\n\n38:40.720 --> 38:43.320\n you don't have to put in rear view mirrors or sensors\n\n38:43.320 --> 38:44.600\n or a rear view mirror.\n\n38:44.600 --> 38:46.680\n You could save a lot of money on a car\n\n38:46.680 --> 38:48.960\n by not putting in all of the stuff\n\n38:48.960 --> 38:50.560\n to keep things from going wrong.\n\n38:52.160 --> 38:53.220\n And I think that's what we had.\n\n38:53.220 --> 38:57.660\n We had a machine that as long as growth was insanely good,\n\n38:57.660 --> 39:01.320\n we plowed it back, the riches and spoils and then treasure\n\n39:01.320 --> 39:04.800\n back into the system and made more genius stuff.\n\n39:04.800 --> 39:07.060\n And we carried along a good chunk of humanity,\n\n39:07.060 --> 39:09.320\n hundreds of millions of people.\n\n39:09.320 --> 39:11.460\n We did not have a plan for what happens\n\n39:11.460 --> 39:15.260\n when the growth goes below the stall speed of our society.\n\n39:16.140 --> 39:19.000\n How confident should we be that the growth has slowed\n\n39:19.000 --> 39:24.000\n in a way that is permanent rather than a kind of slap\n\n39:24.960 --> 39:26.320\n in the face where we...\n\n39:26.320 --> 39:27.760\n It's not the right concept.\n\n39:27.760 --> 39:31.600\n Right concept is, I try to use the same words\n\n39:31.600 --> 39:33.320\n over and over again in case people see mold\n\n39:33.320 --> 39:35.800\n because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere.\n\n39:35.800 --> 39:38.000\n So I use this analogy of the orchard\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:40.840\n because everyone talks about low hanging fruit.\n\n39:40.840 --> 39:43.480\n They know the concept of low hanging fruit,\n\n39:43.480 --> 39:47.220\n but they don't think in terms of orchards.\n\n39:47.220 --> 39:48.740\n So they say things like,\n\n39:48.740 --> 39:50.720\n you think we've picked all the low hanging fruit,\n\n39:50.720 --> 39:53.960\n but I believe in the inventiveness of the human mind.\n\n39:53.960 --> 39:58.640\n It's like, okay, that doesn't even work as an analogy.\n\n39:58.640 --> 40:00.080\n What if the idea is we only picked\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:01.760\n all the low hanging fruit here,\n\n40:01.760 --> 40:03.320\n and then we're having this stupid argument\n\n40:03.320 --> 40:04.480\n about low hanging fruit,\n\n40:04.480 --> 40:06.880\n and we're not going and looking for new orchards.\n\n40:06.880 --> 40:08.080\n We're not planting new orchards.\n\n40:08.080 --> 40:09.800\n We're not looking for forests.\n\n40:09.800 --> 40:11.840\n We're just sitting here arguing about low hanging fruit.\n\n40:11.840 --> 40:14.200\n So my claim is there's probably a lot more low hanging fruit\n\n40:14.200 --> 40:15.680\n and it's not here.\n\n40:15.680 --> 40:16.720\n It's in other orchards.\n\n40:16.720 --> 40:17.560\n It's in other orchards.\n\n40:17.560 --> 40:20.020\n One of those turned out to be the digital orchard.\n\n40:20.020 --> 40:24.320\n The digital orchard has not been as stagnant\n\n40:24.320 --> 40:28.400\n as lots of these other, like the chemical orchard.\n\n40:29.880 --> 40:33.520\n I have faith that there is a small percentage\n\n40:33.520 --> 40:36.400\n of the population, but not zero,\n\n40:36.400 --> 40:38.240\n that's looking for those other orchards.\n\n40:38.240 --> 40:40.400\n Like I'm excited about one of those orchards,\n\n40:40.400 --> 40:43.800\n which is, I believe there'll be robots in everybody's homes\n\n40:43.800 --> 40:48.040\n and that will unlock some totally new thing.\n\n40:48.040 --> 40:51.760\n Totally new set of technologies, ideas,\n\n40:51.760 --> 40:54.520\n the way we live life, the productivity,\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:57.560\n all the everything, it'll change everything.\n\n40:57.560 --> 40:59.140\n So I'm excited about that orchard.\n\n40:59.140 --> 41:01.240\n So I'm roaming that orchard\n\n41:01.240 --> 41:05.520\n and wondering how the hell you kind of bring back\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:08.520\n like the ant that finds a new source of food.\n\n41:08.520 --> 41:11.520\n I'm trying to find an apple I can bring back to the.\n\n41:11.520 --> 41:16.080\n Great, so you're in an explorer idiom.\n\n41:16.080 --> 41:18.240\n And do you have faith that there's enough of those?\n\n41:18.240 --> 41:20.080\n I don't think there are very many of us.\n\n41:20.080 --> 41:22.040\n I mean, I'm one of them too.\n\n41:22.040 --> 41:23.180\n How many does it take?\n\n41:23.180 --> 41:24.080\n It takes one ant.\n\n41:25.560 --> 41:26.400\n It takes one ant.\n\n41:26.400 --> 41:28.680\n What are you talking about?\n\n41:28.680 --> 41:31.720\n How many elons does it take to screw in a light bulb?\n\n41:31.720 --> 41:35.200\n Okay, let's imagine that we went,\n\n41:35.200 --> 41:39.400\n imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food, right?\n\n41:39.400 --> 41:42.320\n And then it comes back to the colony and it says,\n\n41:42.320 --> 41:44.680\n hey, I think I found a new source of food.\n\n41:44.680 --> 41:46.840\n And the initial reaction is,\n\n41:46.840 --> 41:49.740\n you're not authorized to find new food.\n\n41:49.740 --> 41:51.200\n What?\n\n41:51.200 --> 41:52.680\n Why would you try to go find new food?\n\n41:52.680 --> 41:54.160\n We're gonna remove you from Twitter.\n\n41:54.160 --> 41:55.520\n Yeah, and by the way,\n\n41:55.520 --> 41:56.960\n I think the fact that you think you're allowed\n\n41:56.960 --> 41:59.400\n to go find new food shows how privileged you are as an ant.\n\n41:59.400 --> 42:01.900\n Get out of the colony, kill him, kill him.\n\n42:01.900 --> 42:04.720\n Well, that's probably not a great model\n\n42:04.720 --> 42:06.400\n for finding new orchards.\n\n42:06.400 --> 42:08.980\n And I think that what we find is that\n\n42:08.980 --> 42:11.880\n where there's a system that allows somebody to ascend\n\n42:11.880 --> 42:15.560\n without a lot of gatekeeping, you can have that.\n\n42:15.560 --> 42:17.560\n But I saw this happen in hedge funds.\n\n42:17.560 --> 42:22.560\n Hedge funds for a while hoovered up a lot of talent\n\n42:22.840 --> 42:27.160\n because they were places that had funding and had freedom.\n\n42:27.160 --> 42:32.000\n And in general, really smart people want to be free\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:33.840\n and they don't wanna think a lot about\n\n42:34.800 --> 42:37.280\n how they're gonna feed themselves.\n\n42:37.280 --> 42:39.920\n They wanna get lost in their minds.\n\n42:39.920 --> 42:42.800\n So you can either give them productive places to play,\n\n42:42.800 --> 42:44.400\n dangerous places to play.\n\n42:45.560 --> 42:47.360\n They're either gonna break into computers\n\n42:47.360 --> 42:52.360\n or find vaccines for you or build bombs or build companies.\n\n42:53.120 --> 42:58.120\n And we're not providing for the people who have to disrupt\n\n42:58.320 --> 43:01.480\n and have to innovate and trying to channel that effort.\n\n43:01.480 --> 43:03.980\n We're so focused on this other thing,\n\n43:03.980 --> 43:06.120\n which is fairness and safety.\n\n43:06.120 --> 43:08.280\n And fairness and safety, by the way, are really important.\n\n43:08.280 --> 43:10.160\n I don't wanna denigrate them.\n\n43:10.160 --> 43:12.880\n But the singular focus on fairness and safety\n\n43:12.880 --> 43:17.680\n without, in the same breath, being focused on growth\n\n43:17.680 --> 43:21.320\n and discovery and creation is gonna doom us\n\n43:21.320 --> 43:23.600\n because what we're talking about is we're always talking\n\n43:23.600 --> 43:25.580\n about divvying up the pie that is\n\n43:25.580 --> 43:28.440\n as opposed to the pie that will be.\n\n43:28.440 --> 43:30.760\n Imagine that you spent all your time trying to divvy up\n\n43:30.760 --> 43:34.900\n the 13th century pie and you destroyed your ability\n\n43:34.900 --> 43:36.340\n to get to the 20th century.\n\n43:36.340 --> 43:38.100\n You'd be an idiot.\n\n43:38.100 --> 43:42.000\n But one place I think I disagree with you\n\n43:42.000 --> 43:45.020\n is I don't think you need that many people\n\n43:45.020 --> 43:47.320\n to empower the geniuses, the innovators,\n\n43:47.320 --> 43:50.800\n the people who refuse to spend most of their days\n\n43:50.800 --> 43:52.200\n in meetings about fairness.\n\n43:52.200 --> 43:53.760\n This is good.\n\n43:53.760 --> 43:54.800\n Let's have a disagreement.\n\n43:54.800 --> 43:57.960\n I think podcasting, whatever you call that medium,\n\n43:57.960 --> 44:01.400\n is just one little example of a tool\n\n44:01.400 --> 44:03.500\n that you can give power to,\n\n44:03.500 --> 44:08.500\n like you and your podcast can have the next Elon Musk\n\n44:09.060 --> 44:09.900\n and make him a star.\n\n44:09.900 --> 44:11.140\n Now I see where you're going.\n\n44:11.140 --> 44:11.980\n Okay.\n\n44:11.980 --> 44:14.060\n There have been a series of places\n\n44:14.060 --> 44:17.280\n for people to play and be free.\n\n44:17.280 --> 44:19.900\n And we've lost them successively.\n\n44:19.900 --> 44:21.440\n What's a good place you remember?\n\n44:21.440 --> 44:23.200\n Because I disagree with you there too.\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:24.540\n I think they're still there.\n\n44:24.540 --> 44:25.620\n You can still play.\n\n44:25.620 --> 44:28.180\n You interviewed Noam Chomsky.\n\n44:28.180 --> 44:29.160\n Yes.\n\n44:29.160 --> 44:30.000\n Okay.\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.140\n Noam Chomsky comes from an era.\n\n44:32.140 --> 44:33.120\n Where you can play?\n\n44:33.120 --> 44:34.180\n Where you could play?\n\n44:34.180 --> 44:35.020\n At MIT.\n\n44:35.020 --> 44:36.180\n At MIT.\n\n44:36.180 --> 44:37.000\n And you can't play.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:38.300\n This is where I disagree with you.\n\n44:38.300 --> 44:39.420\n We've already had this.\n\n44:39.420 --> 44:40.260\n But.\n\n44:40.260 --> 44:43.700\n Go check the Clips channel for the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n44:43.700 --> 44:46.700\n I think I wasn't brave enough at that time\n\n44:46.700 --> 44:48.780\n and I'm not really brave enough now.\n\n44:48.780 --> 44:49.620\n Come on.\n\n44:49.620 --> 44:50.440\n Because I don't.\n\n44:50.440 --> 44:51.980\n Where's the vodka?\n\n44:51.980 --> 44:54.620\n It's a feeling and people are gonna tear me apart.\n\n44:54.620 --> 44:55.460\n Oh, what are you?\n\n44:55.460 --> 44:58.220\n And you speak from emotion and facts.\n\n44:58.220 --> 44:59.380\n Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n44:59.380 --> 45:00.220\n The feeling.\n\n45:00.220 --> 45:01.040\n What podcast is this?\n\n45:01.040 --> 45:01.880\n It's yours.\n\n45:01.880 --> 45:02.720\n Yes.\n\n45:02.720 --> 45:05.860\n Tell the people who are currently editing your brain,\n\n45:05.860 --> 45:07.180\n because I saw that move right now.\n\n45:07.180 --> 45:08.220\n Yeah.\n\n45:08.220 --> 45:10.780\n That they should go find another podcast.\n\n45:10.780 --> 45:11.620\n Right?\n\n45:11.620 --> 45:13.740\n Let's get rid of some of your audience right now.\n\n45:14.900 --> 45:16.460\n Please go find another podcast\n\n45:16.460 --> 45:17.620\n if you're editing my brain.\n\n45:17.620 --> 45:19.580\n Nevertheless, all the self doubt,\n\n45:19.580 --> 45:20.860\n they're sitting in that brain.\n\n45:20.860 --> 45:21.700\n So.\n\n45:21.700 --> 45:22.520\n I can't stand to watch this.\n\n45:22.520 --> 45:23.360\n But all right.\n\n45:23.360 --> 45:25.600\n What is this self doubt loop that you're in?\n\n45:25.600 --> 45:26.440\n The thing is,\n\n45:27.620 --> 45:30.760\n when I walk the halls of MIT.\n\n45:30.760 --> 45:32.000\n Yeah.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.460\n There's bureaucracy, there's administrators\n\n45:34.460 --> 45:36.000\n that never have done anything interesting\n\n45:36.000 --> 45:37.460\n in their entire lives.\n\n45:37.460 --> 45:39.220\n There's meetings, there's.\n\n45:39.220 --> 45:40.060\n All the usual crap.\n\n45:40.060 --> 45:41.200\n All the usual crap.\n\n45:41.200 --> 45:45.420\n But there's, in the eyes of individuals.\n\n45:45.420 --> 45:46.260\n Yeah.\n\n45:46.260 --> 45:48.460\n There's this glow of excitement\n\n45:48.460 --> 45:49.700\n that has nothing to do with career.\n\n45:49.700 --> 45:51.140\n I understand this.\n\n45:51.140 --> 45:52.860\n And it's still a playground.\n\n45:52.860 --> 45:55.700\n There's little pockets of playgrounds\n\n45:55.700 --> 45:58.080\n from which genius can emerge still.\n\n45:58.080 --> 46:01.340\n And they're unaffected by diversity meetings\n\n46:01.340 --> 46:04.540\n or fairness meetings or blah, blah, blah.\n\n46:04.540 --> 46:05.500\n I love to hear that.\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:06.340\n Yeah?\n\n46:06.340 --> 46:07.160\n Well, you don't think so?\n\n46:07.160 --> 46:08.800\n I don't believe it.\n\n46:08.800 --> 46:10.220\n Cause I've watched the change, Lex.\n\n46:10.220 --> 46:11.320\n I've watched people.\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:13.580\n We were all editing ourselves all the time.\n\n46:13.580 --> 46:14.920\n I remember my old mind.\n\n46:14.920 --> 46:16.140\n I liked it better.\n\n46:17.300 --> 46:21.020\n All of this relentless focus on critical race theory\n\n46:21.020 --> 46:25.060\n and critical theory, postmodernism, fairness,\n\n46:25.060 --> 46:26.160\n social justice.\n\n46:26.160 --> 46:29.720\n It's making many of us into worse people.\n\n46:29.720 --> 46:30.920\n You think that's that?\n\n46:30.920 --> 46:34.120\n Do you think the Matt Damon's of the character\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:35.740\n is paying attention to any of that?\n\n46:35.740 --> 46:36.580\n You think that has an effect?\n\n46:36.580 --> 46:39.300\n Have you seen what happened to Matt Damon himself?\n\n46:39.300 --> 46:41.980\n Matt Damon has tried to say various things at various times\n\n46:41.980 --> 46:44.100\n that seemed to be relatively innocuous.\n\n46:44.100 --> 46:45.500\n He can't speak.\n\n46:45.500 --> 46:46.340\n Okay.\n\n46:46.340 --> 46:48.400\n Well, let's not mix up.\n\n46:48.400 --> 46:49.740\n Matt Damon is just an actor.\n\n46:49.740 --> 46:50.920\n Well, I don't know.\n\n46:50.920 --> 46:52.540\n He was just a Harvard student\n\n46:52.540 --> 46:55.300\n who came up with his own genius screenplay,\n\n46:55.300 --> 46:56.940\n acted and made it happen.\n\n46:56.940 --> 46:57.780\n No.\n\n46:57.780 --> 46:59.280\n No, we're somewhere else.\n\n46:59.280 --> 47:01.780\n You don't think you can build a rocket company\n\n47:01.780 --> 47:03.380\n out of MIT still?\n\n47:03.380 --> 47:06.460\n I think that there are things that you can still do.\n\n47:06.460 --> 47:07.360\n But we're losing them.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:08.780\n We lose them.\n\n47:08.780 --> 47:10.740\n We keep losing them.\n\n47:10.740 --> 47:12.380\n I would say the biggest problem,\n\n47:13.300 --> 47:14.220\n here, let me just say,\n\n47:14.220 --> 47:16.060\n what I think the solution would be\n\n47:16.060 --> 47:21.060\n is to fire anybody who's not faculty,\n\n47:22.460 --> 47:25.100\n especially young faculty should have way more power\n\n47:25.100 --> 47:27.780\n and administration should have much less power.\n\n47:27.780 --> 47:30.200\n Because right now, the administration,\n\n47:31.120 --> 47:33.920\n which used some of the, who used to be faculty,\n\n47:33.920 --> 47:37.060\n but they've lost the fire, the spark that gave them,\n\n47:37.060 --> 47:39.860\n they've lost the memories of the playground.\n\n47:39.860 --> 47:43.340\n And so the people that admire and love the playground,\n\n47:43.340 --> 47:44.780\n like you could see it in their behavior,\n\n47:44.780 --> 47:46.780\n should have way more power.\n\n47:46.780 --> 47:49.880\n And so we should create a systems that give them power.\n\n47:49.880 --> 47:50.720\n I think I'll take it.\n\n47:50.720 --> 47:51.700\n You're very idealistic.\n\n47:51.700 --> 47:52.540\n Yeah.\n\n47:52.540 --> 47:54.500\n And you're very, you've got a huge heart.\n\n47:55.580 --> 47:56.600\n It's a weird time.\n\n47:56.600 --> 47:58.600\n Cause I don't want to dissuade you\n\n47:58.600 --> 48:01.000\n from believing beautiful things.\n\n48:02.160 --> 48:04.220\n Because I see how potent you are.\n\n48:04.220 --> 48:05.740\n You do all these things,\n\n48:05.740 --> 48:09.540\n Jiu Jitsu, guitar, podcasting, programming, computers,\n\n48:11.480 --> 48:12.520\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n48:13.840 --> 48:14.840\n I don't think you're right.\n\n48:14.840 --> 48:17.460\n I think we're in a really deeply screwed up place\n\n48:17.460 --> 48:19.860\n where even the tiny number of,\n\n48:19.860 --> 48:23.560\n let me give you an alternate version of this dystopia.\n\n48:23.560 --> 48:25.580\n I do think that there are people who are capable\n\n48:25.580 --> 48:27.100\n and there's still places to play\n\n48:27.100 --> 48:30.620\n and cause things to happen that progress the story forward.\n\n48:30.620 --> 48:33.700\n But if you look at the fire that some of the people are in\n\n48:33.700 --> 48:35.780\n who fit that profile,\n\n48:35.780 --> 48:38.480\n like how much crap has Elon Musk taken?\n\n48:39.780 --> 48:42.880\n Quite considerable, right?\n\n48:42.880 --> 48:46.340\n And not much admiration from the...\n\n48:46.340 --> 48:50.280\n Craig Venter, Jim Watson.\n\n48:51.560 --> 48:53.720\n These are very difficult people.\n\n48:53.720 --> 48:57.240\n Steve Jobs is a very difficult guy, you know?\n\n48:58.800 --> 49:01.440\n Yeah, it is a bit heartbreaking to me.\n\n49:01.440 --> 49:03.640\n I mean, everybody is different generations.\n\n49:03.640 --> 49:05.880\n I just, my mind is a little focused on Elon Musk\n\n49:05.880 --> 49:08.360\n because he's the modern person.\n\n49:08.360 --> 49:09.380\n Well, you know him.\n\n49:09.380 --> 49:10.880\n I mean, he's a person to you.\n\n49:11.880 --> 49:16.400\n It hurts my heart to see how few faculty\n\n49:16.400 --> 49:21.400\n and people with Nobel prizes and so on admire Elon.\n\n49:21.400 --> 49:26.400\n He gets a lot of fans from people that buy his products\n\n49:28.720 --> 49:31.640\n and young minds just excited.\n\n49:31.640 --> 49:33.560\n But why don't we as an institution,\n\n49:33.560 --> 49:38.560\n why doesn't MIT say that somebody amongst us\n\n49:39.980 --> 49:43.520\n will be the next Elon Musk and we want to encourage them?\n\n49:43.520 --> 49:46.640\n Like say that, say that in meetings, say that.\n\n49:46.640 --> 49:51.120\n Like that's success for us as MIT.\n\n49:51.120 --> 49:54.080\n And they, instead there's this jealousy.\n\n49:54.080 --> 49:56.920\n It's like, did you hear what Elon Musk tweeted?\n\n49:56.920 --> 50:00.440\n Did you see, like how irresponsible is what he's doing?\n\n50:00.440 --> 50:04.000\n How, like you're just saying all these things\n\n50:04.000 --> 50:09.000\n that are just dripping with jealousy and basically...\n\n50:09.200 --> 50:10.260\n I want what he's got.\n\n50:10.260 --> 50:11.600\n That's the thing, right?\n\n50:13.680 --> 50:14.760\n Here's the weird thing.\n\n50:14.760 --> 50:17.220\n Rivalry has a different signature.\n\n50:17.220 --> 50:21.680\n You see, when you know that you're never going to make it,\n\n50:22.820 --> 50:25.080\n that's the position you take.\n\n50:26.060 --> 50:29.900\n What is it in Kung Fu Panda, which you've watched now?\n\n50:29.900 --> 50:31.040\n Yes. Yes.\n\n50:31.040 --> 50:35.340\n What does Tai Lung say when he's looking\n\n50:35.340 --> 50:37.740\n for the dragon warrior and the furious five\n\n50:37.740 --> 50:39.680\n come to defeat him on the bridge?\n\n50:40.980 --> 50:44.740\n One of them gives up Poe's name accidentally\n\n50:44.740 --> 50:46.140\n and Tai Lung hears it.\n\n50:46.140 --> 50:48.460\n Poe, so that is his name.\n\n50:48.460 --> 50:50.460\n Finally, a worthy opponent.\n\n50:50.460 --> 50:53.260\n Our battle will be legendary, right?\n\n50:53.260 --> 50:54.740\n He's excited.\n\n50:54.740 --> 50:56.320\n Why is that?\n\n50:56.320 --> 50:58.040\n Well, you learn about this in boxing.\n\n50:58.040 --> 51:01.500\n Sometimes you'll see a division or an MMA,\n\n51:01.500 --> 51:03.960\n which is lousy with talent.\n\n51:03.960 --> 51:05.340\n Just, you can't swing a cat\n\n51:05.340 --> 51:07.700\n without hitting an amazing athlete.\n\n51:09.120 --> 51:10.280\n Sometimes you'll have a division,\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:12.760\n which at that particular moment has one star\n\n51:12.760 --> 51:16.560\n and no real competition in that weight class or something.\n\n51:16.560 --> 51:18.560\n That person is in bad shape\n\n51:18.560 --> 51:23.480\n because you can't build a legend without the other.\n\n51:24.780 --> 51:26.460\n When you think of Muhammad Ali,\n\n51:26.460 --> 51:28.980\n what are the names that you immediately think of?\n\n51:28.980 --> 51:31.380\n And you have to phrase your,\n\n51:31.380 --> 51:33.200\n you have to think of the other heavyweights.\n\n51:33.200 --> 51:34.480\n Liston.\n\n51:34.480 --> 51:35.840\n Right.\n\n51:35.840 --> 51:40.840\n So those opponents are in part what made Muhammad Ali\n\n51:40.840 --> 51:42.320\n Muhammad Ali.\n\n51:42.320 --> 51:47.320\n And that's why the Mayweather McGregor revelation that,\n\n51:49.880 --> 51:53.400\n okay, this guy has got his opponent's picture in his house.\n\n51:53.400 --> 51:54.600\n How weird is that?\n\n51:55.560 --> 51:56.960\n Well, because without the opponent,\n\n51:56.960 --> 51:58.280\n you may not be able to get there.\n\n51:58.280 --> 52:03.280\n Now, I am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries.\n\n52:05.000 --> 52:06.920\n Do you have examples in mind?\n\n52:06.920 --> 52:08.120\n Well, there are rivalries\n\n52:08.120 --> 52:10.200\n where people take each other's credit cards\n\n52:10.200 --> 52:12.880\n and take each other's credit and screw each other over.\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:17.480\n And then there are other rivalries like the RNA Thai Club\n\n52:17.480 --> 52:20.780\n where these guys were so in love with what they were doing\n\n52:20.780 --> 52:22.460\n that they couldn't wait to share everything.\n\n52:22.460 --> 52:25.840\n And like Nobel prizes were so abundant\n\n52:25.840 --> 52:28.000\n that most people got Nobel prizes\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.080\n just for being a member of the RNA Thai Club\n\n52:30.080 --> 52:31.040\n and doing cool stuff.\n\n52:31.040 --> 52:36.040\n And yeah, that's the golden kind of sweet spot.\n\n52:36.040 --> 52:38.960\n Most of these people can't do what Elon's doing\n\n52:38.960 --> 52:40.280\n because they can't break rules,\n\n52:40.280 --> 52:41.800\n they can't take the pressure.\n\n52:41.800 --> 52:43.160\n I'll tell you what really concerns me\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:44.360\n about your perspective.\n\n52:45.400 --> 52:48.120\n I think that there are a lot of genius ideas\n\n52:48.120 --> 52:50.840\n inside of people who don't have the stomach\n\n52:50.840 --> 52:53.520\n for conflict and derision.\n\n52:53.520 --> 52:55.560\n And I think a lot of those people are female.\n\n52:57.200 --> 52:59.960\n And I think that until we come up with a world\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:02.680\n in which we can swat down the trolls,\n\n53:02.680 --> 53:07.680\n or we can actually cause the trolls not to ruin everything.\n\n53:07.680 --> 53:09.920\n And I don't necessarily mean by shutting them up,\n\n53:09.920 --> 53:13.040\n I don't necessarily mean by being brutal to them,\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:15.920\n but somehow separating off people who are working\n\n53:15.920 --> 53:17.320\n and people who are trolling.\n\n53:18.360 --> 53:21.360\n I think that we're losing a huge amount of human genius\n\n53:21.360 --> 53:26.360\n in part because women in particular\n\n53:26.360 --> 53:29.600\n are not necessarily going to push an idea\n\n53:29.600 --> 53:32.840\n if it results in 10 years of being derided.\n\n53:34.200 --> 53:37.360\n Very few men are willing to do that either.\n\n53:37.360 --> 53:39.720\n But there are some of us who are so dumb\n\n53:39.720 --> 53:43.000\n that we will pigheadedly stick to an idea for 10 years\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:44.960\n even if the world collapses.\n\n53:44.960 --> 53:47.080\n I don't think that there are as many women\n\n53:47.080 --> 53:49.240\n who are going to make that calculation\n\n53:49.240 --> 53:51.160\n even if they know the idea is correct.\n\n53:51.160 --> 53:53.640\n And one of the things that I believe technology\n\n53:53.640 --> 53:55.280\n can help us fight the trolls,\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:57.360\n of all definitions of troll,\n\n53:57.360 --> 54:00.360\n like I believe that a better Twitter can be built.\n\n54:00.360 --> 54:02.840\n Interesting, I do not.\n\n54:02.840 --> 54:05.560\n I don't believe that a Twitter successor can be built\n\n54:05.560 --> 54:07.720\n that solves most of the problems.\n\n54:07.720 --> 54:10.280\n I think you can always improve what we have,\n\n54:10.280 --> 54:12.360\n but I don't think that converges in something\n\n54:12.360 --> 54:14.360\n that really works because I think ultimately\n\n54:14.360 --> 54:16.600\n the problem isn't Twitter, the problem is us.\n\n54:17.760 --> 54:19.040\n For example, I've recently made\n\n54:19.040 --> 54:21.760\n a very disturbing realization,\n\n54:23.280 --> 54:26.360\n which is academics and social scientists\n\n54:26.360 --> 54:30.280\n and academics and trolls have very many similar behaviors.\n\n54:30.280 --> 54:31.720\n Absolutely.\n\n54:31.720 --> 54:34.160\n It's largely a trolling community.\n\n54:34.160 --> 54:38.520\n I tend to believe that the trolls are not,\n\n54:38.520 --> 54:42.160\n it's like the Peter Thiel mini mind idea,\n\n54:42.160 --> 54:45.080\n which in all of the trolls,\n\n54:45.080 --> 54:47.800\n there's the possibility of goodness.\n\n54:47.800 --> 54:50.240\n And all you have to do, not all you have to do,\n\n54:50.240 --> 54:52.520\n what you have to do is create technology\n\n54:52.520 --> 54:57.520\n that incentivizes them to embrace,\n\n54:58.160 --> 55:00.160\n to discover, to embrace,\n\n55:00.160 --> 55:04.240\n to practice the better angels of their nature.\n\n55:04.240 --> 55:09.240\n And I believe that people actually want to do that.\n\n55:10.120 --> 55:15.000\n The trolls is a short term dopamine rush\n\n55:15.000 --> 55:20.000\n of childish toxicity that all of us want to overcome.\n\n55:20.000 --> 55:23.280\n I believe that like deep within, we want to overcome that.\n\n55:23.280 --> 55:27.400\n I try to keep myself from believing what you believe.\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:30.960\n Because you'd be disappointed if it's not true.\n\n55:30.960 --> 55:31.800\n Because it's dangerous,\n\n55:31.800 --> 55:34.480\n because a lot of these people are implacable foes\n\n55:34.480 --> 55:35.880\n and there aren't many of them,\n\n55:35.880 --> 55:37.880\n but when you meet somebody who's like,\n\n55:37.880 --> 55:39.800\n yeah, I just like screwing people up.\n\n55:39.800 --> 55:40.880\n I'm here for the pain.\n\n55:42.040 --> 55:44.520\n I just believe even in them, there's a good.\n\n55:44.520 --> 55:47.480\n There's a wonderful book that I'm gonna recommend to you\n\n55:47.480 --> 55:49.040\n where I hope this comes from.\n\n55:49.040 --> 55:50.520\n Maybe I've got the source wrong,\n\n55:50.520 --> 55:52.320\n but in any event, it's a great book\n\n55:52.320 --> 55:55.440\n called Maximum City about Bombay.\n\n55:56.400 --> 56:00.360\n And I believe the conceit is that the author\n\n56:01.560 --> 56:04.120\n leaves Bombay as a kid and comes back as an adult\n\n56:04.120 --> 56:06.520\n and he realizes he has to rediscover the city\n\n56:06.520 --> 56:09.280\n because he can't live in the city he left.\n\n56:09.280 --> 56:12.680\n So he gets in contact with all of the weird areas\n\n56:12.680 --> 56:15.360\n of the city and one of them is the underworld.\n\n56:15.360 --> 56:16.400\n He hangs out with the police,\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:19.840\n but in the underworld, he's talking to contract killers.\n\n56:19.840 --> 56:22.480\n And he says, you know, it's really weird.\n\n56:22.480 --> 56:26.360\n Everybody pleads for their life right before I kill them.\n\n56:26.360 --> 56:28.320\n And they always say this thing about,\n\n56:28.320 --> 56:31.440\n I've got two kids at home.\n\n56:32.560 --> 56:34.560\n He says, never say that to a contract killer\n\n56:34.560 --> 56:37.640\n because we have terrible relationships with our parents.\n\n56:37.640 --> 56:40.120\n Doesn't it dare us to do that?\n\n56:40.120 --> 56:41.520\n And I was just thinking like, oh, wow.\n\n56:41.520 --> 56:44.000\n So there's a minus sign in front of that statement.\n\n56:44.000 --> 56:45.320\n You're sitting there saying, you know,\n\n56:45.320 --> 56:46.960\n I've got a three year old, it's like,\n\n56:46.960 --> 56:51.360\n okay, well, I'm gonna take this POS out of that kid's life.\n\n56:51.360 --> 56:53.080\n Maybe I'll have a chance.\n\n56:53.080 --> 56:54.880\n You don't know how people are wired.\n\n56:56.080 --> 56:58.560\n And as much as I hate to say it,\n\n56:58.560 --> 57:01.360\n there are people whose wiring is so disturbing\n\n57:01.360 --> 57:03.320\n and so different from yours\n\n57:03.320 --> 57:07.240\n that you will never guess why you can't reach them\n\n57:07.240 --> 57:09.040\n or how much pleasure they may have gotten\n\n57:09.040 --> 57:11.840\n because they may have gone over a point of no return.\n\n57:11.840 --> 57:15.760\n Nevertheless, you are just a smart guy\n\n57:15.760 --> 57:19.000\n who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis.\n\n57:19.000 --> 57:20.480\n You do not know this for sure.\n\n57:20.480 --> 57:21.560\n Nope.\n\n57:21.560 --> 57:26.120\n And I am, you know, whatever the hell I am\n\n57:27.480 --> 57:29.680\n that has a different hypothesis\n\n57:29.680 --> 57:32.800\n that even in the darkest human beings\n\n57:32.800 --> 57:36.920\n that seem to be only full of evil,\n\n57:36.920 --> 57:39.560\n there's a good person there that could be discovered.\n\n57:39.560 --> 57:42.720\n And that's one of the reasons I love doing your show\n\n57:42.720 --> 57:45.760\n is that you have these beliefs, even as a Russian.\n\n57:48.160 --> 57:49.400\n The Russian special.\n\n57:49.400 --> 57:52.560\n As you know, the Russian, there is a weirdness\n\n57:52.560 --> 57:55.720\n which is a total cynicism and total idealism\n\n57:55.720 --> 57:56.880\n locked together, right?\n\n57:56.880 --> 57:59.280\n That's very much a part of the Russian character.\n\n58:00.680 --> 58:02.400\n The reason I kept bothering you,\n\n58:02.400 --> 58:04.080\n kept bothering you to have this conversation\n\n58:04.080 --> 58:09.080\n is I'm really worried about the next couple of months.\n\n58:09.080 --> 58:10.560\n No kidding.\n\n58:10.560 --> 58:13.760\n And if there's anybody in this world\n\n58:13.760 --> 58:18.240\n that could help alleviate my worry\n\n58:18.240 --> 58:22.000\n by at least walking along with me\n\n58:22.000 --> 58:25.960\n through this worry of mine, it's you.\n\n58:25.960 --> 58:29.120\n Do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war?\n\n58:30.160 --> 58:32.400\n Some kind of division that explodes\n\n58:32.400 --> 58:34.880\n beyond just stuff on Twitter,\n\n58:34.880 --> 58:39.040\n but something that's really destructive\n\n58:39.040 --> 58:41.920\n to the fabric of our society?\n\n58:41.920 --> 58:45.320\n Well, I believe we're in a revolution, as you know.\n\n58:45.320 --> 58:46.920\n I've called it the no name revolution\n\n58:46.920 --> 58:48.280\n or N squared revolution.\n\n58:48.280 --> 58:50.160\n I've been talking about it for years.\n\n58:51.320 --> 58:54.680\n I don't think, I think waiting for this\n\n58:54.680 --> 58:57.160\n to be called a civil war is not smart.\n\n58:58.160 --> 59:00.000\n Only history will call it such.\n\n59:00.000 --> 59:00.840\n Fine.\n\n59:00.840 --> 59:01.920\n But I think that the problem is\n\n59:01.920 --> 59:03.200\n is that you're encountering things\n\n59:03.200 --> 59:05.000\n that you've never seen trying to fit them\n\n59:05.000 --> 59:06.880\n into things that you already know.\n\n59:06.880 --> 59:07.720\n Right.\n\n59:07.720 --> 59:08.560\n And.\n\n59:08.560 --> 59:10.600\n But history repeats itself.\n\n59:10.600 --> 59:12.000\n Yes, ish.\n\n59:13.880 --> 59:15.640\n You don't see lessons from history in.\n\n59:15.640 --> 59:16.480\n I do.\n\n59:16.480 --> 59:17.320\n We see today.\n\n59:17.320 --> 59:18.880\n But I don't see it repeating itself.\n\n59:18.880 --> 59:22.000\n You know, the famous quote is that it rhymes.\n\n59:22.000 --> 59:23.240\n It rhymes.\n\n59:23.240 --> 59:27.440\n I mean, the thing I guess I'm speaking to is violence.\n\n59:27.440 --> 59:28.280\n And.\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:29.640\n We're in there.\n\n59:29.640 --> 59:31.760\n The abstraction of violence.\n\n59:31.760 --> 59:36.480\n Imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class.\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:37.320\n Okay.\n\n59:38.120 --> 59:40.520\n Thank you for speaking to the audience.\n\n59:40.520 --> 59:42.080\n Trying to lose these people.\n\n59:42.080 --> 59:42.920\n Come with me.\n\n59:44.800 --> 59:45.640\n Go on.\n\n59:45.640 --> 59:46.480\n No, no, no.\n\n59:46.480 --> 59:48.560\n Look, I've dealt with your audience\n\n59:48.560 --> 59:51.640\n and your audience contains the smartest people around.\n\n59:51.640 --> 59:54.120\n I guarantee you if I say some stuff,\n\n59:54.120 --> 59:55.680\n first of all, any wrong thing that I'll say,\n\n59:55.680 --> 59:56.560\n they're gonna detail.\n\n59:56.560 --> 59:58.200\n So that'll be a little bit of catnip\n\n59:58.200 --> 1:00:00.280\n to bring in the smart people.\n\n1:00:00.280 --> 1:00:02.080\n But they'll also digest it for each other.\n\n1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:04.440\n It's one of the great lessons of long form podcasting.\n\n1:00:04.440 --> 1:00:07.560\n If you don't waste all your time explaining things,\n\n1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:11.200\n that's the job of the audience to do amongst themselves.\n\n1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:12.640\n They're happy doing the work.\n\n1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:14.360\n And those who aren't, they leave.\n\n1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:15.200\n Isn't that great?\n\n1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:16.040\n They'll leave.\n\n1:00:16.040 --> 1:00:18.440\n The people who don't wanna struggle will leave.\n\n1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:20.160\n You can get rid of them.\n\n1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:23.840\n I think that the point is you would want to say\n\n1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:28.040\n violence is defined relative to a context.\n\n1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:30.400\n So let's call it meta violence so that we don't get\n\n1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.200\n into the problem.\n\n1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:34.600\n We already have a term for physical violence, right?\n\n1:00:34.600 --> 1:00:37.440\n So we have meta violence and physical violence.\n\n1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:38.720\n I would say that physical violence\n\n1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:40.600\n is subclassed from meta violence.\n\n1:00:40.600 --> 1:00:43.200\n Meta violence is the disruption of a system.\n\n1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:48.200\n It's sort of, for example, if a cell dies,\n\n1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:52.280\n you can die through apoptosis or necrosis.\n\n1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:55.400\n Apoptosis is controlled programmed cell death.\n\n1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:59.960\n Necrosis is just like, okay, this didn't work.\n\n1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.200\n That was a violent disruption of the system.\n\n1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:05.760\n And this meta class is presumed in the documentation.\n\n1:01:05.760 --> 1:01:07.600\n Is it all negative?\n\n1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:10.120\n No, what are you talking about?\n\n1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:12.200\n So this is part of the problem\n\n1:01:12.200 --> 1:01:14.320\n in the madness of our age, right?\n\n1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:19.320\n Which is if you open up a drawer in your cabinet,\n\n1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:23.200\n right, in your kitchen,\n\n1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.960\n and you see knives, spoons, and forks,\n\n1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:28.600\n do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils\n\n1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:30.560\n and the knives or forks are bad utensils\n\n1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:32.080\n because they're mean?\n\n1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:34.800\n I mean, like if you start thinking in these terms,\n\n1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:38.160\n that knife is there to do violence.\n\n1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:43.040\n That's violence you want done, right?\n\n1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:45.640\n When I cut a mango, I'm doing violence to the mango.\n\n1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:48.760\n The mango expects that I will do violence to it\n\n1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:51.400\n because otherwise I won't be able to get the meat\n\n1:01:51.400 --> 1:01:56.400\n and it won't get its seed spread somewhere else.\n\n1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:01.200\n So in part, violence is absolutely part of our story.\n\n1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.240\n So, okay, so there's this meta violence class.\n\n1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:05.920\n And what's...\n\n1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:08.560\n So the meta violence class is already,\n\n1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.000\n it's a multiple inheritance pattern.\n\n1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:13.440\n Whatever's going on right now inherits from meta violence.\n\n1:02:13.440 --> 1:02:16.000\n No, but there's certain subclasses\n\n1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:21.000\n that allow evil to emerge.\n\n1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.880\n So what I'm specifically worried about is that...\n\n1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:26.080\n What's on your mind, Lex?\n\n1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:27.080\n What's really going on?\n\n1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:27.920\n Okay.\n\n1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:34.160\n I worry that amidst the chaos of these protests\n\n1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:41.800\n or the chaos that could be created by the feeling\n\n1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:47.120\n that the election does not represent the voice\n\n1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:50.120\n of the people, like saying that whoever gets,\n\n1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:51.880\n quote unquote, wins the election\n\n1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:55.440\n according to some kind of reporting of the numbers\n\n1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:58.960\n that come out, that's not going to represent\n\n1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:02.840\n what people actually want to be the leader.\n\n1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:05.160\n Like something in that narrative will create\n\n1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:09.040\n so much division that people will resort\n\n1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:12.520\n to literal violence, like protests that really...\n\n1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:17.680\n That the United States loses its united aspect.\n\n1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:21.800\n And because of that, because of that chaos and tension,\n\n1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:26.800\n evil people, evil forces that my definition of evil\n\n1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:32.040\n is just cruel human beings use that moment to attain power.\n\n1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:37.920\n The kind of power that is ultimately goes against the ideal\n\n1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:39.200\n of the United States.\n\n1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:40.760\n That could be Donald Trump.\n\n1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:42.520\n That could be another human being.\n\n1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:43.880\n It doesn't really matter.\n\n1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:47.760\n My worry is that love doesn't win out in this.\n\n1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:49.960\n The unity doesn't win out in this.\n\n1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:54.960\n And I feel like you and I have responsibility.\n\n1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:58.880\n No kidding. Yeah, I know.\n\n1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:03.760\n And so how do we let love win in this moment\n\n1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:07.480\n of potential chaos? We're gonna have to fight for it.\n\n1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:09.840\n You're gonna have to become a fighter.\n\n1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.320\n You're gonna have to throw some serious punches\n\n1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:13.760\n if that's what you want.\n\n1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:15.240\n You have to be Muhammad Ali here\n\n1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:19.480\n because the moment you start criticizing anything,\n\n1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.240\n people, you have to be a masterful communicator because...\n\n1:04:23.240 --> 1:04:24.480\n That's why you're here.\n\n1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:31.120\n Look, Lex, in part, your decency is allowing you\n\n1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:35.120\n to do things that you couldn't otherwise do.\n\n1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:38.400\n I saw that you had Michael Malice on your podcast.\n\n1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:39.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:43.240\n Now, Michael Malice is, I think of somebody\n\n1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.280\n who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful, yes?\n\n1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:51.240\n He's also got this trolling game,\n\n1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:53.560\n which he's quite open about and you talk to him about it,\n\n1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:54.680\n which I can't stand.\n\n1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:58.120\n And this is the idea, oh, grandpa doesn't get the internet.\n\n1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:00.000\n Well, I'm grandpa, I don't get the internet.\n\n1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.880\n I don't love the trolling.\n\n1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.880\n There are trolls of the past who were incredibly good.\n\n1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:09.920\n I don't see any of the modern trolls\n\n1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:12.920\n as being that kind of genius level trolling the people\n\n1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:16.480\n who deserve it in the way that they deserve it.\n\n1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:18.400\n Right now, what I see is that anything\n\n1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:20.200\n that stands up gets cut down.\n\n1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:21.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:22.160\n It's like anything earnest,\n\n1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:25.960\n you have to turn it into cynicism and a meme.\n\n1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:28.440\n It's this idea that the people who believe\n\n1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:30.800\n that the world is chaos and has no point\n\n1:05:30.800 --> 1:05:33.320\n are constantly trying to let you know,\n\n1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:35.720\n don't try to use the internet for meaning,\n\n1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.120\n for decency, for goodness, because we are going to find out\n\n1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.840\n that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy.\n\n1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:44.440\n And we will make you suffer.\n\n1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:46.640\n So I do think that there's a lot\n\n1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:48.320\n of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world.\n\n1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:52.200\n Some of it mine, some of it yours, but we all have it.\n\n1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:55.360\n And the trolls somewhat remove that,\n\n1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:57.740\n but it's not a judicious, kind, constructive,\n\n1:05:57.740 --> 1:06:00.360\n compassionate, caring version most of the time.\n\n1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:01.680\n And a lot of those trolls,\n\n1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.600\n and I have this feeling about Michael Malice,\n\n1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.560\n I don't know whether it's right,\n\n1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:08.960\n that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it\n\n1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:11.880\n and that that's motivating some of the trolling behavior.\n\n1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.680\n And you and I don't seem to be doing that.\n\n1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:16.560\n I don't see you as almost ever trolling.\n\n1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:19.760\n Now you and I, I'm very much against trolling.\n\n1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:21.520\n I'm very much against trolling.\n\n1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:23.920\n It doesn't mean that it's selective.\n\n1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:25.680\n You know what, it's not even true.\n\n1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:28.480\n Like everything we say, we say like,\n\n1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:30.000\n I'm for it, I'm against it.\n\n1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:33.000\n This isn't my native language.\n\n1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:33.920\n I speak nuance.\n\n1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:35.520\n I don't speak this internet shit.\n\n1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:40.520\n And the more I have to communicate through internet shit,\n\n1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:44.360\n right, I almost never take a tweet seriously\n\n1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:49.360\n if it contains the letters LMAO, LOL, RTFOL, you know, FOL.\n\n1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:54.360\n There's an interesting effect where people say stuff\n\n1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:56.320\n and then finish with LOL.\n\n1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:59.680\n You put it beautifully that it indicates to me\n\n1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:00.800\n that this is a person,\n\n1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:03.280\n we've talked about like why I wear this stupid suit,\n\n1:07:03.280 --> 1:07:06.720\n is like this is anti, this is to fight the LOL\n\n1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:09.600\n at the end of sentences, is take,\n\n1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:11.920\n it's like stand up for the words you're saying.\n\n1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.640\n Don't finish stuff with LOL,\n\n1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:17.240\n removing completely the responsibility of the content\n\n1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.400\n of the sentence that preceded it.\n\n1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:22.560\n Yeah, also choosing the outfit that works both\n\n1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.480\n for Men in Black and the Blues Brothers,\n\n1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:26.680\n not a terrible choice.\n\n1:07:26.680 --> 1:07:28.960\n Okay, but getting back, look, Lex,\n\n1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:31.080\n we're not in a position to do this.\n\n1:07:31.080 --> 1:07:34.560\n You need to be seated in a different chair.\n\n1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:37.120\n Your chair is the wrong chair.\n\n1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:39.080\n You're in the wrong chair.\n\n1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:41.320\n It's been so long.\n\n1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:44.340\n All right, I want to talk about you and Joe Biden.\n\n1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.400\n Joe Biden was a 29 year old guy\n\n1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:52.820\n with nothing particular going on so far as I can tell.\n\n1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:59.200\n Okay, I know people as impressive at age 29 as Joe Biden,\n\n1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:04.200\n 12 rows back, 3D, doesn't matter, huge number of people.\n\n1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:09.320\n None of them my age can get to where he got to.\n\n1:08:09.320 --> 1:08:10.580\n Like we're all morons.\n\n1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:14.800\n Anytime somebody takes out,\n\n1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:17.560\n like if you found Eddie Van Halen in a guitar shop,\n\n1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:19.940\n you'd be angry.\n\n1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:23.920\n What is this guy doing repairing guitars?\n\n1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:29.100\n Then somebody will say, maybe he loves to repair guitars.\n\n1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:30.760\n Yeah, I mean, what is your piano,\n\n1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.200\n Russian piano tuner doing?\n\n1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:33.560\n What is my Russian piano?\n\n1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:35.560\n That was the whole point of that story,\n\n1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:40.480\n which is what is it that happened in that life\n\n1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:41.640\n that converted somebody?\n\n1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.780\n And I find this, for example, with Russian doctors\n\n1:08:44.780 --> 1:08:47.560\n who are technicians in offices now.\n\n1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:52.340\n There's a huge amount of talent in the world\n\n1:08:52.340 --> 1:08:54.800\n that's not sitting in its proper seat.\n\n1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:57.780\n And quite honestly, I've gotten to the point\n\n1:08:57.780 --> 1:09:00.020\n where my feeling is we've got to take the seats.\n\n1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:05.020\n And maybe we don't sit in them.\n\n1:09:05.020 --> 1:09:06.660\n Maybe the idea is that we take the seats\n\n1:09:06.660 --> 1:09:09.500\n and we put some smart Gen Z person in the seat\n\n1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:12.780\n and say, look, no chanting.\n\n1:09:12.780 --> 1:09:15.500\n I don't wanna hear you say, no justice, no peace.\n\n1:09:15.500 --> 1:09:20.020\n If there aren't verbs, if it rhymes, it's wrong.\n\n1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:21.700\n Like I used to have this thing,\n\n1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:23.500\n if it rhymed things that rhymed wrong,\n\n1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:26.340\n if it rhymed things that rhyme are more true.\n\n1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:28.980\n But like in general, if something starts out\n\n1:09:28.980 --> 1:09:30.260\n one, two, three, four,\n\n1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:32.180\n I don't wanna hear what the rest of your sentences.\n\n1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:33.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:34.540 --> 1:09:38.300\n But I feel like the responsibility that you carry,\n\n1:09:38.300 --> 1:09:42.420\n that I carry, this is where Joe Rogan\n\n1:09:42.420 --> 1:09:44.740\n generally removes himself from being,\n\n1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:45.980\n I'm just a comedian.\n\n1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:47.900\n This idea of I'm just a comedian.\n\n1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:49.420\n We all do that.\n\n1:09:49.420 --> 1:09:52.580\n But at this moment in history,\n\n1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:55.260\n like history literally can pivot\n\n1:09:55.260 --> 1:09:57.740\n on the words of a tattooed,\n\n1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:04.300\n ripped 50 year old comedian.\n\n1:10:04.300 --> 1:10:06.260\n And I think the same is true with you.\n\n1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:10.420\n Okay, well, I'm interested and I care.\n\n1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:11.580\n Speaking of lyrics,\n\n1:10:13.340 --> 1:10:14.500\n there are many here among us\n\n1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:17.020\n who feel that life has been a joke.\n\n1:10:17.020 --> 1:10:18.420\n That's not us.\n\n1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:19.400\n The hour is getting late.\n\n1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.820\n That's not us.\n\n1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:23.300\n In the song, the joker and the thief\n\n1:10:23.300 --> 1:10:24.740\n are on opposite sides of Jesus\n\n1:10:24.740 --> 1:10:26.600\n having this conversation over Jesus.\n\n1:10:27.580 --> 1:10:28.940\n You and I, we've been through that.\n\n1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:29.940\n That's not our fate.\n\n1:10:29.940 --> 1:10:31.060\n That's somebody else's fate\n\n1:10:31.060 --> 1:10:33.440\n to throw spitballs at the internet.\n\n1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:34.580\n That's not your fate.\n\n1:10:34.580 --> 1:10:35.820\n You're an earnest guy.\n\n1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:36.780\n You're filled with love.\n\n1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:38.500\n You're getting the most amazing podcasts.\n\n1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:39.340\n Yes, you're broadcasting.\n\n1:10:39.340 --> 1:10:40.740\n But you can win over the internet.\n\n1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:42.180\n This is the point I'm trying to make\n\n1:10:42.180 --> 1:10:44.780\n that you're saying I'm just a grandpa.\n\n1:10:44.780 --> 1:10:45.620\n I don't get the internet.\n\n1:10:45.620 --> 1:10:47.220\n No, I'm telling you, you're gonna get bigger\n\n1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:49.240\n and then you're gonna get cut down.\n\n1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.020\n You're gonna keep ascending for a while, Lex.\n\n1:10:52.020 --> 1:10:53.700\n And then you're saying, and naturally there's a...\n\n1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:55.740\n I'm telling you, I watch the same process.\n\n1:10:55.740 --> 1:10:57.900\n People get up to a certain level.\n\n1:10:57.900 --> 1:10:59.180\n And one of the things that's going on,\n\n1:10:59.180 --> 1:11:01.380\n in my opinion, with Joe Rogan,\n\n1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:03.940\n is that when Joe Rogan starts to talk\n\n1:11:03.940 --> 1:11:06.980\n about his misgivings about Joe Biden,\n\n1:11:06.980 --> 1:11:09.860\n in a way that you find at any bar in America,\n\n1:11:11.020 --> 1:11:13.520\n about cognitive decline in a 77 year old\n\n1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:16.420\n who's about to be 78, I believe in November,\n\n1:11:16.420 --> 1:11:20.300\n we have never had anything remotely as insane\n\n1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:25.300\n as a 78 year old person slated to win the White House.\n\n1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:29.740\n And you're saying when that idea is being communicated,\n\n1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:32.020\n is there something about the disc concept\n\n1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:33.660\n that you talk about, the system naturally starts to...\n\n1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:35.380\n Some bad thing happens to Joe\n\n1:11:35.380 --> 1:11:37.360\n or one of Joe's close associates.\n\n1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.820\n The ability to destroy people who become inconvenient\n\n1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:44.180\n has been documented.\n\n1:11:44.180 --> 1:11:47.240\n This is what we have done in the past.\n\n1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.180\n Whether we are doing it now, we don't know,\n\n1:11:49.180 --> 1:11:53.000\n because we are not doing this church committee too.\n\n1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.560\n In order to know whether or not\n\n1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.080\n you are currently destroying American citizens\n\n1:11:57.080 --> 1:11:59.400\n as we did in the past and as we have documented,\n\n1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:02.040\n as we found out in 1976,\n\n1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:05.600\n the federal government destroyed Americans\n\n1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:07.480\n who had political beliefs\n\n1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:11.440\n that the government didn't want to continue.\n\n1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:14.920\n And I don't know whether you are grasping that.\n\n1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:18.000\n One interpretation of why Jon Stewart\n\n1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.480\n and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher,\n\n1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:25.000\n all these people to some extent hide behind, it's a joke.\n\n1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:25.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:29.240\n It's because they're trying to find a protected class.\n\n1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:32.720\n Is there some place I can stand and speak the truth\n\n1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.660\n which does not result in my being garbage collected?\n\n1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:37.400\n Interesting.\n\n1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:38.440\n I guess you're right.\n\n1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:43.280\n My intuition is you can stand, as you gain more power,\n\n1:12:43.280 --> 1:12:46.760\n you can stand behind your words.\n\n1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.640\n There's a fight over Joe Rogan right now.\n\n1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:52.780\n I mean, I've talked about it for a few years now.\n\n1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:55.600\n People did not understand how big that program was.\n\n1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:57.560\n People didn't understand long form podcasting.\n\n1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:01.880\n I was derided by people who I think of as being very shrewd\n\n1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.360\n for believing in these podcasts as a major force.\n\n1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.200\n And most of the people who derided me have said,\n\n1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:11.400\n wow, did I not get things?\n\n1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:13.280\n It's like if you started to propose,\n\n1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:17.400\n you wanted to do the Sopranos\n\n1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:20.480\n in the era of 30 minute sitcoms.\n\n1:13:21.400 --> 1:13:22.800\n Like, you don't get it, man.\n\n1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:24.480\n The American people, they're not interested\n\n1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:25.880\n in these long plot storylines.\n\n1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:27.160\n That's your weird thing?\n\n1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:28.840\n Nobody cares, dude.\n\n1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:31.880\n Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.\n\n1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.960\n And like, okay, so if you do that,\n\n1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:35.440\n you totally miss the opportunity.\n\n1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:38.160\n And the savvy people used to say,\n\n1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.160\n kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime\n\n1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:43.000\n underestimating the intelligence of the American people.\n\n1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.200\n Well, that was totally wrong\n\n1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:46.920\n because they didn't calculate opportunity costs.\n\n1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:50.600\n I have been talking about the problem of Joe for a long time.\n\n1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:54.000\n The problem is, is that when the system wakes up,\n\n1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.520\n they're gonna wanna control it.\n\n1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.960\n And they come up with new different mechanisms\n\n1:13:58.960 --> 1:13:59.880\n of doing that.\n\n1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:03.200\n I guess one interesting one is cancel culture.\n\n1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.640\n Well, look at the number of people around Joe\n\n1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:07.520\n who they've come after since they realized\n\n1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.480\n that Joe was really big.\n\n1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:14.480\n Joey Diaz, Brian Callan, Chris Delia.\n\n1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.440\n Now, I'm not saying that those are all related,\n\n1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.960\n but I do notice that there are at least correlations\n\n1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:29.960\n between when Joe says something\n\n1:14:29.960 --> 1:14:33.280\n when something bad happens in Joe's universe.\n\n1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:36.280\n It's easier for me to believe that that's happening\n\n1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:38.880\n when it's happening around Joe himself.\n\n1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:42.520\n But I'm worried about my friend.\n\n1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:45.520\n And I don't necessarily wanna push him\n\n1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:48.800\n towards being more if he doesn't want it.\n\n1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:51.760\n Because I don't wanna conscript people.\n\n1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:52.640\n He's got a great life.\n\n1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:53.920\n He's got a great situation.\n\n1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:56.200\n He's done a huge service.\n\n1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:57.040\n Thank God.\n\n1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:01.760\n How much do I owe Joe just for what he's done for you\n\n1:15:01.760 --> 1:15:03.360\n to say nothing of what he's done for me\n\n1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:06.680\n or for Brett or for Sam or any of these people?\n\n1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:10.640\n And I'd like to think that we all try to give back,\n\n1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:12.880\n but I'm worried about Joe.\n\n1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.080\n He's not worried.\n\n1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:18.280\n One of the inspiring things about Joe\n\n1:15:18.280 --> 1:15:21.520\n is he's in this war alone.\n\n1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:25.800\n And the way he fights the war is by just enjoying life.\n\n1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:27.960\n Well, that's his thing, as long as he stays close\n\n1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:30.000\n to things that he loves and being,\n\n1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.760\n one of the things is he's honest about his drug use.\n\n1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:34.760\n He loves to hunt.\n\n1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:36.440\n So he's just, he does a certain amount\n\n1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:40.320\n of like semi vice signaling upfront.\n\n1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:41.520\n And then you just also know him.\n\n1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.640\n This is why every time they try to take him down,\n\n1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:45.160\n you use the N word.\n\n1:15:47.440 --> 1:15:50.840\n Unfortunately, everybody knows who Joe is.\n\n1:15:50.840 --> 1:15:55.840\n And yes, he doesn't act as if he went to a fancy\n\n1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:58.440\n finishing school, right?\n\n1:15:58.440 --> 1:16:00.160\n That's not his energy.\n\n1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:02.280\n The fact that you've got some super smart guy\n\n1:16:02.280 --> 1:16:04.240\n who always pretends to be a meathead,\n\n1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.640\n just like, hey, I'm a comedian.\n\n1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.680\n It's like all these defenses and disguises.\n\n1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.040\n Okay, you've got this super smart guy\n\n1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:14.440\n who he's admitted to most of the things\n\n1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:17.040\n that you can take him down for.\n\n1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:19.920\n And because everybody's been effectively in his den\n\n1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.000\n his basement, think about that studio is his basement.\n\n1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.920\n People have hung out with Joe so many hours\n\n1:16:24.920 --> 1:16:26.800\n that you can't tell them something about Joe\n\n1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:27.640\n where they're gonna say, wow,\n\n1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:28.800\n I'm gonna believe the New York Times\n\n1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:31.080\n and not the hundreds of hours I've spent\n\n1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:32.040\n on the Joe Rogan experience.\n\n1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:35.200\n But the cool thing is that this is what inspires me\n\n1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:37.960\n is that the way he's waging war against the system,\n\n1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:40.640\n it's just by being a good person\n\n1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:44.640\n and talking enough hours in a week\n\n1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:48.680\n where that message like bleeds throughout the words\n\n1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:49.920\n and the gaps between.\n\n1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:51.880\n And that's so inspiring to me\n\n1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:55.000\n that the good people can win by just being good.\n\n1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.680\n And he's kind and he's tough.\n\n1:16:57.680 --> 1:17:00.320\n And he also, he's no pushover.\n\n1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:05.400\n I always worry a little bit when I sit down in my chair.\n\n1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:07.520\n You still get scared that he'll call you\n\n1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:09.640\n on some kind of bullshit that you weren't even aware of?\n\n1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:12.160\n No, the first time I was on the show,\n\n1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:14.400\n the energy wasn't great between us.\n\n1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.520\n And it was in a sober October situation.\n\n1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:18.120\n So I think I hadn't understood that\n\n1:17:18.120 --> 1:17:20.200\n and maybe our egos got a little bit off.\n\n1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:23.800\n I don't know.\n\n1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:25.440\n I mean, I was having fun,\n\n1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:28.640\n but maybe it was just too complicated life forms\n\n1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:29.560\n getting to know each other.\n\n1:17:29.560 --> 1:17:32.680\n The first one was probably,\n\n1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:37.600\n yeah, that made me a little nervous for the future.\n\n1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:40.480\n But then, Joe and I have become friends,\n\n1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:42.440\n although sometimes we have miscommunications\n\n1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:46.040\n like on Yom Kippur, I texted him and I said,\n\n1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:50.120\n Joe, I want to apologize for ways I've let you down\n\n1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:51.920\n as a friend that haven't been there for you\n\n1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:54.760\n and appreciate everything you've done for me all this time.\n\n1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:56.360\n Like I get this text back like,\n\n1:17:56.360 --> 1:17:57.800\n what the fuck is your problem?\n\n1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:00.000\n You're great, dude.\n\n1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.360\n I don't know what bad place you're in, but cheer up.\n\n1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:04.640\n It's like, Joe, don't you have any Jews in your life\n\n1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.640\n that apologize for what they've done?\n\n1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:09.600\n He was just like, dude, have you lost your mind?\n\n1:18:09.600 --> 1:18:11.160\n What the hell's gotten into you?\n\n1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:16.160\n Yeah, what do you think about the Spotify thing?\n\n1:18:17.720 --> 1:18:18.560\n What about it?\n\n1:18:18.560 --> 1:18:19.400\n Ask me a question.\n\n1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:23.160\n He's now, as opposed to being just a comedian\n\n1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.120\n with the podcast, he now is just a comedian\n\n1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:28.840\n with the podcast who stepped like in the middle\n\n1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:31.400\n of the center of cancel culture,\n\n1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:33.880\n which is like, I know Spotify is in Sweden,\n\n1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:37.120\n but they represent Silicon Valley.\n\n1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:40.880\n They represent the very kind of structures.\n\n1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:43.680\n They contain and represent the kind of structures\n\n1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:47.180\n that threatened to destroy the Elans of the world.\n\n1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.560\n And he just like stepped like with his Alex Jones\n\n1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:56.560\n and his Joey Diaz just strolled right into the middle of it.\n\n1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.920\n Yeah, I think it's awesome.\n\n1:18:58.920 --> 1:18:59.920\n I love it.\n\n1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:04.440\n But do you think he's strong enough to, I don't know.\n\n1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.400\n I mean, I don't even know the right way to ask this,\n\n1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:08.960\n but is he strong enough to persevere?\n\n1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:10.040\n It's a bit interesting.\n\n1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:13.080\n It's like when a lion decides, wow,\n\n1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:14.520\n that honey badger looks tasty.\n\n1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:17.280\n I'm gonna swallow it whole, see what happens.\n\n1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:18.880\n Because I talked to him offline.\n\n1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:22.320\n He really seems to be willing to give away the 100 million,\n\n1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:24.100\n which gives him so much power.\n\n1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:29.100\n Oh, I don't, it's a powerful thing to be able to say,\n\n1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:33.240\n I don't, yeah, to the honey badger.\n\n1:19:33.240 --> 1:19:35.500\n He just strolls in, but he's willing to walk away\n\n1:19:35.500 --> 1:19:36.340\n from anything in this world.\n\n1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:38.640\n Well, he's gonna walk out the other side of the lion.\n\n1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.780\n I don't think he's gonna go out the way he came in.\n\n1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:41.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:41.620 --> 1:19:42.560\n Well, you know what it is?\n\n1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:44.760\n It's Tommy Lee Jones entering the bug.\n\n1:19:45.620 --> 1:19:47.920\n This is like a giant alien, he just walks into it?\n\n1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:49.760\n He just, he gets swallowed by the bug\n\n1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:52.020\n and he blasts out from the inside.\n\n1:19:52.020 --> 1:19:53.680\n I have it as Tommy Lee Jones.\n\n1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:55.680\n Yeah, that's Joe Rogan to you.\n\n1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:58.040\n Yeah, is that my feeling is that Spotify\n\n1:19:58.040 --> 1:19:59.600\n doesn't understand what they're messing with.\n\n1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:01.960\n I could be wrong, but I'm not.\n\n1:20:01.960 --> 1:20:02.800\n No, you're right.\n\n1:20:02.800 --> 1:20:03.620\n I'm right.\n\n1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:07.060\n Because Joe doesn't need anything, man.\n\n1:20:07.060 --> 1:20:08.760\n I mean, this is the weird thing about it.\n\n1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:10.480\n It's like, I'm sure that he loves all his toys,\n\n1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:11.400\n whatever, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:20:11.400 --> 1:20:12.700\n He's a rich guy.\n\n1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:14.160\n Yes, he's got a few money.\n\n1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.680\n He had a few money a long time ago.\n\n1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:21.220\n And you're not, you know, the other thing about,\n\n1:20:21.220 --> 1:20:23.680\n it's a bit weird being friends with a dude like that.\n\n1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:24.520\n It just is.\n\n1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:26.960\n Cause like you call him up or he'll call you up\n\n1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:29.200\n and he's like, what's going on in your life?\n\n1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:30.100\n I don't know.\n\n1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:32.000\n Kind of depressed, trying to get some math done.\n\n1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.480\n What are you up?\n\n1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:34.720\n Oh dude, I can cheer you up.\n\n1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:37.780\n I just came off of a 29,000 person stadium.\n\n1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:40.000\n It's like, oh cool.\n\n1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.840\n How'd you do that?\n\n1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:41.680\n Oh, I don't know.\n\n1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.280\n I just announced it on Instagram a few days ago\n\n1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:44.560\n and it filled up.\n\n1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:46.900\n Just like, oh damn.\n\n1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:51.200\n I mean, that thing is so powerful.\n\n1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:52.040\n So there you go.\n\n1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:54.360\n I mean, you could be that too.\n\n1:20:54.360 --> 1:20:57.440\n The instant Joe takes an interest in politics\n\n1:20:57.440 --> 1:20:58.280\n and saving the world.\n\n1:20:58.280 --> 1:20:59.780\n You might destroy all of that.\n\n1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:01.360\n It's going bye bye.\n\n1:21:01.360 --> 1:21:02.200\n I promise you.\n\n1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.040\n I just disagree with you.\n\n1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:05.960\n I mean, cause you have to do it.\n\n1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:07.760\n Like you've said this many times before.\n\n1:21:07.760 --> 1:21:11.720\n I'll bet you, I'll bet you a bottle of Stoli\n\n1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:14.840\n that you can get, if you get Joe Rogan\n\n1:21:14.840 --> 1:21:16.440\n to get highly politically active\n\n1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:18.940\n and call out the system for all the bullshit that it is\n\n1:21:18.940 --> 1:21:21.040\n in a very pointed and determined fashion\n\n1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:26.300\n and he doesn't get destroyed, I'll give you the vodka.\n\n1:21:26.300 --> 1:21:27.140\n The vodka?\n\n1:21:27.140 --> 1:21:27.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:29.880\n That sounds like a pretty damn good deal.\n\n1:21:29.880 --> 1:21:32.320\n But you've said this, I mean.\n\n1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:36.800\n No living heroes, my friend, no living heroes.\n\n1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:37.680\n I just.\n\n1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:39.320\n No living heroes.\n\n1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:40.800\n It's just difficult.\n\n1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:42.360\n You just have to be good at it.\n\n1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:45.000\n I mean, if you just say generic political things.\n\n1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:45.840\n No, no.\n\n1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:48.120\n You're going to be taken down.\n\n1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.200\n But if you're. The more heroic you are,\n\n1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:52.580\n the more beautiful you are,\n\n1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:54.840\n the more you will be made to suffer.\n\n1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:56.600\n If they cannot get you on reputation.\n\n1:21:56.600 --> 1:21:59.040\n If Jesus himself came down.\n\n1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:00.540\n I don't know if I ever read.\n\n1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:02.680\n I probably have never read to you the hit piece\n\n1:22:02.680 --> 1:22:03.780\n I did on Jesus.\n\n1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:05.460\n You don't know about this?\n\n1:22:05.460 --> 1:22:06.300\n No, I did not know.\n\n1:22:06.300 --> 1:22:09.860\n I did hit pieces on all of the best people in the world.\n\n1:22:09.860 --> 1:22:11.020\n Wow.\n\n1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:14.120\n So whoever it was who cured cancer,\n\n1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:16.840\n discovered new particles or whatever it is,\n\n1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:18.600\n I did a hit piece against them to prove\n\n1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:22.680\n that I can do it to anybody around anything at any time.\n\n1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:24.840\n Except Eddie Van Halen is what we're talking about.\n\n1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:26.600\n Well, Eddie Van Halen is now dead.\n\n1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:31.140\n But if this was a situation, you know, hot for teacher,\n\n1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:33.760\n canceled.\n\n1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:35.040\n Disrespectful.\n\n1:22:35.040 --> 1:22:36.280\n Absolutely.\n\n1:22:38.440 --> 1:22:43.440\n Also, you know, packaging female objectification\n\n1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:44.880\n for young men.\n\n1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:47.660\n Clearly Eddie Van Halen is one of the worst people alive.\n\n1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:52.660\n But the skill, the incredible inspiration\n\n1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:55.740\n that is just radiating from his music\n\n1:22:55.740 --> 1:22:57.240\n inspires so many millions\n\n1:22:57.240 --> 1:23:00.040\n that they will fight those canceled pieces.\n\n1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:01.240\n This is your thing.\n\n1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:03.620\n You have this idea that there's a war between good and evil\n\n1:23:03.620 --> 1:23:06.960\n and the good has already been designated the winner.\n\n1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:08.360\n And it's not true.\n\n1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:11.520\n But your belief that it's true.\n\n1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:13.040\n Fake it till you make it, no?\n\n1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:16.560\n I mean, you gotta, it's motivating both of us.\n\n1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:18.500\n Like I also believe that we're gonna win\n\n1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.220\n because if I don't, then I can't get out of bed\n\n1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:22.100\n and it's pretty heavy at the moment.\n\n1:23:22.100 --> 1:23:27.100\n Do you think 2021 can make us feel good\n\n1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:31.120\n about the trajectory of society?\n\n1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:36.040\n So like where we emerge from this year feeling good.\n\n1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.520\n Like there's a smile on Eric Weinstein's face\n\n1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:40.360\n and the next time we talk,\n\n1:23:40.360 --> 1:23:42.780\n we'll be doing some kind of duet on guitar\n\n1:23:42.780 --> 1:23:45.960\n and not having this worried look on our faces.\n\n1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:48.440\n No.\n\n1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.480\n Okay, but you've also promised\n\n1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:53.840\n you're going to somehow end this in a positive.\n\n1:23:54.840 --> 1:23:57.640\n Okay, so how do you turn the no around?\n\n1:23:57.640 --> 1:23:59.360\n What's the U turn from the no?\n\n1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:03.060\n Until we get some actually decent people\n\n1:24:03.060 --> 1:24:06.240\n in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking\n\n1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:09.360\n about their next paycheck, I don't see a solution.\n\n1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:13.280\n Let me just say what the prerequisites for a solution are\n\n1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:15.720\n and to let you know why I don't think it's coming.\n\n1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:21.360\n First of all, both of these political parties,\n\n1:24:21.360 --> 1:24:24.580\n the leadership of them is disgusting and has to go.\n\n1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:26.620\n They're tearing us apart.\n\n1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:28.900\n They lack the will to be Americans.\n\n1:24:28.900 --> 1:24:32.200\n They don't understand the subtlety of the project.\n\n1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:34.080\n They're simply the people who figured out\n\n1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:37.640\n how to inhabit the seats and that is their great achievement.\n\n1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:43.780\n I believe that in order to solve this,\n\n1:24:43.780 --> 1:24:45.280\n you need people who can integrate,\n\n1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:47.520\n who are not partisan at the level\n\n1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.040\n of the partisan warriors that we're seeing,\n\n1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:52.560\n people who believe in dividing the pies of the future\n\n1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:56.320\n rather than the present pie as our main task as Americans\n\n1:24:56.320 --> 1:24:58.000\n because we are built around growth.\n\n1:24:58.000 --> 1:24:59.060\n I'm sorry to say it.\n\n1:25:02.760 --> 1:25:06.160\n You need an ability to have subtle conversations\n\n1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:07.960\n and you need the ability to exclude.\n\n1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:13.280\n And at the moment, everyone knows inclusion is good,\n\n1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:14.480\n which it isn't.\n\n1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:16.200\n It's like saying, well, water is good.\n\n1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.780\n If I say water is good, everybody will agree with me.\n\n1:25:18.780 --> 1:25:20.780\n It's not, people drown.\n\n1:25:22.340 --> 1:25:24.600\n People need to get dehydrated.\n\n1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.760\n It can be life saving or life ending.\n\n1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:28.440\n It isn't good or bad.\n\n1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:30.320\n Inclusion is not good or bad.\n\n1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:31.720\n Inclusion is just inclusion.\n\n1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:33.620\n Exclusion is part of inclusion.\n\n1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:37.760\n We've taught people that they can reason through the world\n\n1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:43.840\n as sub cocker spaniels.\n\n1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:45.840\n They just bark things at each other.\n\n1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:48.480\n I'm for safety.\n\n1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:49.720\n I'm for inclusion.\n\n1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:51.080\n I'm for growth.\n\n1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:52.520\n Oh, really?\n\n1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:55.600\n Do you guys use verbs, dependent clauses?\n\n1:25:55.600 --> 1:25:57.280\n Are there compound complex sentences?\n\n1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:01.000\n Where are we in this sea of nonsense?\n\n1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.940\n You have to be able to build a place\n\n1:26:03.940 --> 1:26:06.400\n where you have smart, talented people\n\n1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.700\n who represent a diverse group of correct opinions.\n\n1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:13.200\n You need to get rid of almost all of the people\n\n1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:15.200\n who have opinions that are antithetical\n\n1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:17.660\n to what we're trying to accomplish.\n\n1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:20.680\n You need to give them insulation, which we're terrified\n\n1:26:20.680 --> 1:26:21.820\n because we don't trust anybody.\n\n1:26:21.820 --> 1:26:23.320\n So everything has to be transparent.\n\n1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:24.280\n If you're going to the bathroom,\n\n1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:25.800\n I want those walls to be plexiglass\n\n1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:27.000\n so I can see what you're doing.\n\n1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.300\n It's like, that's too much transparency.\n\n1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:32.200\n We have too much and not enough at the same time.\n\n1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:36.640\n And then in essence, you need to ensure\n\n1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:39.200\n that people aren't worried about feeding their family\n\n1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:41.140\n every four seconds for being real.\n\n1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:43.540\n None of that is happening.\n\n1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:47.240\n And our billionaires, our billionaires are pathetic.\n\n1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:48.960\n What is the point of billionaires\n\n1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:52.000\n if you're not going to do billionaire type cool stuff\n\n1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:57.000\n like saying, F you, and I'm going to throw $3 billion\n\n1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:02.720\n at the project of restoring the national conversation?\n\n1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:06.740\n I don't grasp this.\n\n1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:09.040\n What is the point of creating obscene wealth\n\n1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:10.500\n if we don't have anyone smart enough\n\n1:27:10.500 --> 1:27:12.840\n and caring enough to use it?\n\n1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:16.120\n So I agree with that last part for sure.\n\n1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:20.440\n Let me slightly push back on the idea\n\n1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:22.800\n that the leaders themselves are broken.\n\n1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:27.080\n I feel like this goes to the Joe Rogan,\n\n1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:31.880\n Joe Biden and Trump having a debate on that program.\n\n1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:36.880\n I feel like Joe Biden has a lot of really interesting ideas\n\n1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:40.600\n that he's almost forgot how to communicate.\n\n1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:44.080\n He's been fake for so long within the system.\n\n1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:45.480\n Hillary was fake for too long.\n\n1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.480\n I'm sure she had real ideas at the beginning\n\n1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:50.600\n that she still was campaigning on decades later.\n\n1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:54.920\n But if the system, if the platforms empowered you\n\n1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:56.760\n to search, to be honest, to be real,\n\n1:27:56.760 --> 1:27:59.560\n to search for those ideas within yourself,\n\n1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:02.600\n like long form conversations do,\n\n1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.880\n then even the Donald Trump and Joe Biden leaders\n\n1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:10.640\n we have now would take this country to a better place\n\n1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:12.840\n that would unite people.\n\n1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:15.440\n So like, we can keep the current Congress.\n\n1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:17.680\n We just need to create better platforms.\n\n1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:19.080\n This is going to the intuition\n\n1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:21.400\n that there's good in Donald Trump.\n\n1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:24.760\n There's depth and complexity and intelligence.\n\n1:28:24.760 --> 1:28:26.240\n And the same with Joe Biden.\n\n1:28:26.240 --> 1:28:28.060\n There's good in Joe Biden.\n\n1:28:28.060 --> 1:28:30.300\n And it's just, we're not incentivizing.\n\n1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:35.000\n I mean, there's several things I think are broken.\n\n1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:36.320\n One of them is Twitter.\n\n1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:38.080\n The other is journalism.\n\n1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:41.480\n It's just the platforms of us communicating with each other.\n\n1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:43.240\n One of the reasons that I try to come up\n\n1:28:43.240 --> 1:28:45.800\n with unifying explanations is that,\n\n1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:49.640\n if you look at the number of wildfires in California,\n\n1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:51.920\n let's say, that we've just seen,\n\n1:28:51.920 --> 1:28:53.800\n if you treat them all as spontaneous,\n\n1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.000\n uncorrelated instances, it feels like,\n\n1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:58.640\n oh my God, it's just whack a mole.\n\n1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:00.620\n Every time I send a fire truck here,\n\n1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:02.100\n there's a fire over there.\n\n1:29:02.100 --> 1:29:03.640\n So you want to come up with something\n\n1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:06.400\n like a central theory, which is,\n\n1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:07.840\n why do I suddenly have a problem\n\n1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:09.960\n when I hadn't had a problem before?\n\n1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:12.560\n So I look for these unifying explanations.\n\n1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:15.480\n And I found one the other day that really speaks to me.\n\n1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:18.200\n I mean, people are very frustrated\n\n1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:20.140\n because they've been trained to think about this\n\n1:29:20.140 --> 1:29:21.960\n incorrectly, in my opinion.\n\n1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:25.160\n But here's the graph that you need to look at.\n\n1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:29.560\n On the x axis is time by year.\n\n1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:34.560\n And on the y axis is something like average age of a human.\n\n1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:40.120\n The title of the graph is any desirable situation\n\n1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:41.580\n involving institutions.\n\n1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:48.580\n So that could be CEO, it could be tenured professor.\n\n1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:53.480\n It could be who's getting grants.\n\n1:29:53.480 --> 1:30:01.360\n It could be the age at which people win Nobel Prizes.\n\n1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:04.260\n University presidents, all these things go up.\n\n1:30:05.560 --> 1:30:08.440\n In other words, for a long period of time,\n\n1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:12.440\n the average age of the person in a desirable situation\n\n1:30:12.440 --> 1:30:16.400\n has been increasing something like nine months for every 12.\n\n1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:22.080\n Those graphs have to go down at some point.\n\n1:30:22.080 --> 1:30:27.080\n The specter of having five people all born in the 1940s\n\n1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:33.160\n as the final entrance in the presidential context,\n\n1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.300\n that makes no sense.\n\n1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:38.540\n Think about how bizarre a thing\n\n1:30:38.540 --> 1:30:40.420\n that nobody's even really talking about.\n\n1:30:40.420 --> 1:30:44.600\n The last five people were all ancient\n\n1:30:45.720 --> 1:30:47.060\n by presidential standards.\n\n1:30:47.060 --> 1:30:49.600\n Not one, not two, but five.\n\n1:30:49.600 --> 1:30:54.020\n We are talking about a contest between somebody\n\n1:30:54.020 --> 1:30:56.520\n who is the oldest of the baby boomers,\n\n1:30:57.660 --> 1:30:58.900\n the very beginning of the baby boom,\n\n1:30:58.900 --> 1:31:02.700\n summer of 46th birthday, fighting somebody\n\n1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:05.060\n who is in the silent generation.\n\n1:31:05.060 --> 1:31:08.800\n The silent generation guy in a town hall in Florida\n\n1:31:08.800 --> 1:31:11.480\n gets this question from a Gen Z guy saying,\n\n1:31:12.640 --> 1:31:14.100\n what's going on with my future?\n\n1:31:14.100 --> 1:31:18.220\n Joe Biden has the audacity to say,\n\n1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:20.020\n I'm a transitional president.\n\n1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:21.980\n You guys are the highly educated one.\n\n1:31:22.860 --> 1:31:25.500\n When has any generation in history needed\n\n1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:29.420\n a transitional 78 year old person to take office?\n\n1:31:29.420 --> 1:31:31.300\n It's bizarre, it's preposterous.\n\n1:31:31.300 --> 1:31:35.180\n That graph is the graph we can't talk about.\n\n1:31:35.180 --> 1:31:38.340\n That graph is the graph of our destruction.\n\n1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:44.580\n Because it has the, you can make a one line argument,\n\n1:31:44.580 --> 1:31:49.580\n which sounds like ageism, which isn't a very good argument.\n\n1:31:50.380 --> 1:31:51.220\n No.\n\n1:31:51.220 --> 1:31:54.580\n But what it does is, is it muddles the conversation.\n\n1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:56.680\n And you always have to ask yourself the question,\n\n1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:58.700\n if this conversation becomes muddled,\n\n1:31:58.700 --> 1:32:01.440\n who wins as a result of the muddling?\n\n1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:04.140\n Well, it's a battle, but let's just win it.\n\n1:32:04.140 --> 1:32:05.420\n Let's win the battle.\n\n1:32:05.420 --> 1:32:06.260\n You give.\n\n1:32:06.260 --> 1:32:07.380\n Are you running?\n\n1:32:07.380 --> 1:32:09.340\n For sure, I'll run.\n\n1:32:09.340 --> 1:32:11.140\n I was born in Russia, can't run.\n\n1:32:11.140 --> 1:32:13.860\n So, but we Russians can hack elections,\n\n1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.660\n so we'll figure it out.\n\n1:32:15.660 --> 1:32:17.660\n This is me officially announcing my run for president.\n\n1:32:17.660 --> 1:32:20.520\n I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\n1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:23.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:23.940 --> 1:32:25.820\n Lex, what is it that you really wanna ask?\n\n1:32:25.820 --> 1:32:30.060\n I think, I wanna put some responsibility on the portal.\n\n1:32:30.060 --> 1:32:31.060\n The portal.\n\n1:32:31.060 --> 1:32:32.740\n The portal.\n\n1:32:32.740 --> 1:32:37.740\n That the portal gives power to the people in that graph.\n\n1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:41.140\n Like, cause you put it quite brilliantly\n\n1:32:41.140 --> 1:32:44.700\n that the people that move the world,\n\n1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:46.220\n their age has been going up.\n\n1:32:47.080 --> 1:32:49.780\n And not move the world, but put in the position\n\n1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:52.160\n where they get the chance to affect the world.\n\n1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.760\n These new platforms, I think Twitter falls in them,\n\n1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:00.300\n give power to the younger people.\n\n1:33:00.300 --> 1:33:01.980\n It doesn't have to be about age necessarily,\n\n1:33:01.980 --> 1:33:04.140\n but the younger thinking people.\n\n1:33:04.140 --> 1:33:06.740\n So that's a promising thing.\n\n1:33:06.740 --> 1:33:09.220\n And you are like, you're like Gandalf.\n\n1:33:09.220 --> 1:33:11.900\n You get to pick your Frodo's or whatever.\n\n1:33:11.900 --> 1:33:14.140\n I'm not very good with the analogy,\n\n1:33:14.140 --> 1:33:16.180\n but the whole point is for you as Gandalf.\n\n1:33:16.180 --> 1:33:18.100\n I don't know that I make that much sense.\n\n1:33:18.100 --> 1:33:20.020\n Gandalf makes sense.\n\n1:33:20.020 --> 1:33:22.340\n I don't know if people know how to fit me\n\n1:33:22.340 --> 1:33:24.040\n into this ecosystem.\n\n1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:26.420\n I think there's something in my presentation\n\n1:33:26.420 --> 1:33:27.660\n that people find very confusing.\n\n1:33:27.660 --> 1:33:28.500\n No, figure it out.\n\n1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:30.900\n I disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror\n\n1:33:30.900 --> 1:33:32.960\n and think like, what is it?\n\n1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:36.100\n Is it, maybe you need a mustache.\n\n1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:36.940\n I don't know.\n\n1:33:36.940 --> 1:33:41.900\n But there's something about figuring out\n\n1:33:41.900 --> 1:33:43.740\n how to be a charismatic communicator in this.\n\n1:33:43.740 --> 1:33:45.220\n And that's the responsibility.\n\n1:33:45.220 --> 1:33:48.620\n You said like finishing sentences with the LOL\n\n1:33:48.620 --> 1:33:50.060\n is painful for your soul.\n\n1:33:50.060 --> 1:33:52.140\n Yeah, that's just how somebody lets me know.\n\n1:33:52.140 --> 1:33:54.540\n I don't have to take their opinion seriously.\n\n1:33:54.540 --> 1:33:55.920\n Yeah, it's still the language,\n\n1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:58.340\n the way that people are communicating\n\n1:33:58.340 --> 1:33:59.480\n and you're swimming that wave.\n\n1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.500\n You have a big platform.\n\n1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:02.660\n I have a growing platform.\n\n1:34:02.660 --> 1:34:05.260\n It feels like this is the place to give power.\n\n1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:07.460\n I agree, but we're gonna get swatted down.\n\n1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:08.520\n I just don't think so.\n\n1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:09.360\n You're wrong.\n\n1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:10.820\n Why are you afraid of the big?\n\n1:34:10.820 --> 1:34:13.100\n Like this is, I've studied it.\n\n1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:17.160\n Because I've studied, let me ask you a question, Lex.\n\n1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:21.820\n I believe that every society is supposed to have\n\n1:34:21.820 --> 1:34:25.500\n a collection of what I call break glass\n\n1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:27.120\n in case of emergency people.\n\n1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:29.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:31.540\n These are people who are universally loved\n\n1:34:31.540 --> 1:34:33.060\n and trusted by your society.\n\n1:34:33.060 --> 1:34:35.500\n For example, David Attenborough,\n\n1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:39.300\n the great British naturalist and presenter,\n\n1:34:39.300 --> 1:34:40.620\n recently came on Instagram.\n\n1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:42.140\n He's worried about the planet.\n\n1:34:43.100 --> 1:34:46.540\n And I said, look, there are very few of these people left.\n\n1:34:46.540 --> 1:34:48.380\n Let's pay attention, find out what he has to say.\n\n1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:49.660\n Maybe he's gonna be an ass.\n\n1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:50.500\n Maybe he's gonna be in it.\n\n1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:52.620\n Maybe he's gonna say wrong things, don't know.\n\n1:34:52.620 --> 1:34:56.400\n Tell me about your top 10 universal American heroes.\n\n1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:58.860\n This is not a rhetorical question.\n\n1:34:58.860 --> 1:35:00.420\n No.\n\n1:35:00.420 --> 1:35:02.000\n Give me five.\n\n1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:03.900\n Okay, everybody looks to that person and says,\n\n1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:05.640\n yep, the best of us.\n\n1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.740\n Probably follow that person.\n\n1:35:08.740 --> 1:35:11.500\n Well, everybody's an interesting concept.\n\n1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:14.660\n I mean, Elon Musk is very divisive, right?\n\n1:35:14.660 --> 1:35:16.940\n But I'm talking about overwhelmingly people\n\n1:35:16.940 --> 1:35:21.580\n would follow that person if that person gave a rousing,\n\n1:35:21.580 --> 1:35:25.660\n intelligent speech that said, we must act now\n\n1:35:25.660 --> 1:35:27.360\n because we're in dire straits.\n\n1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:30.000\n I think a lot of people fall in that category.\n\n1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:33.940\n For me, it would be in the tech world,\n\n1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:34.780\n in the engineering world.\n\n1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:35.620\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n1:35:35.620 --> 1:35:36.440\n Tell me his names.\n\n1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:37.280\n Elon Musk.\n\n1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:38.120\n Elon Musk.\n\n1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:42.040\n The Rock.\n\n1:35:43.440 --> 1:35:45.860\n I'm thinking like, who is the most eloquent actor?\n\n1:35:45.860 --> 1:35:48.340\n So like, you think celebrities, so people with platforms.\n\n1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:50.140\n I didn't say celebrities, but you have to be well known.\n\n1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:55.140\n I believe like, yeah, so this goes to Joe Rogan.\n\n1:35:55.140 --> 1:35:55.980\n Hmm.\n\n1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:02.100\n First two did not really impress me\n\n1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:03.840\n as being what I said, but okay.\n\n1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:08.220\n Elon several years ago would have.\n\n1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:10.300\n Can you try to?\n\n1:36:10.300 --> 1:36:11.420\n Joe Rogan has.\n\n1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:12.300\n Why do they fail?\n\n1:36:12.300 --> 1:36:13.380\n Why does Elon fail?\n\n1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:14.940\n Lots of people treat Joe Rogan\n\n1:36:14.940 --> 1:36:17.500\n as if he's some sort of right wing racist\n\n1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:19.640\n because they've never watched his program.\n\n1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:20.660\n They don't know who his friends are.\n\n1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:22.020\n I don't know.\n\n1:36:22.020 --> 1:36:24.820\n Oh, but when I thought you said everybody,\n\n1:36:24.820 --> 1:36:29.180\n I thought you meant a large enough people\n\n1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:31.120\n where a huge change can happen,\n\n1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:33.580\n not actually literally everybody.\n\n1:36:33.580 --> 1:36:34.420\n Because I think.\n\n1:36:34.420 --> 1:36:35.680\n I mean people who've pulled off,\n\n1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:38.520\n like people who've pulled off something\n\n1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:41.720\n where everybody's convinced that that person just deeply.\n\n1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:47.020\n I mean, I think I've told you this story before,\n\n1:36:47.020 --> 1:36:52.020\n but the one time I've seen the power of a figure like this,\n\n1:36:52.020 --> 1:36:55.320\n I mean, very few times I've been in a large crowd\n\n1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:57.600\n and I've seen people just moved\n\n1:36:57.600 --> 1:36:59.280\n where they would do almost anything good,\n\n1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:01.960\n bad and different because they were primed.\n\n1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:06.440\n One was a Rolling Stones concert.\n\n1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:09.840\n The other one was Nelson Mandela coming to Boston.\n\n1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:13.760\n And man, you've never seen anything like this.\n\n1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:15.360\n You check out the photos from the banks\n\n1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:18.200\n of the Charles River when Nelson Mandela came.\n\n1:37:18.200 --> 1:37:23.200\n There are people that you need in your dark hours\n\n1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:26.080\n and we can't agree on who they are.\n\n1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:29.360\n And as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.\n\n1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:31.380\n We get out the shit branch.\n\n1:37:31.380 --> 1:37:32.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:33.040\n I just disagree with you.\n\n1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:33.880\n So I think.\n\n1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.680\n What do we disagree about here?\n\n1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:37.520\n I think it doesn't matter who it is.\n\n1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:40.560\n I think really good speeches are needed.\n\n1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:41.400\n And I think a lot.\n\n1:37:41.400 --> 1:37:42.580\n Who's gonna give them?\n\n1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:44.320\n I saw Killer Mike try to give a good speech.\n\n1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:45.160\n Yeah, he did.\n\n1:37:45.160 --> 1:37:46.000\n Wow.\n\n1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:46.960\n In Atlanta, right?\n\n1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:47.800\n Yeah, he did.\n\n1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:49.320\n That was something.\n\n1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:50.260\n Very impressed.\n\n1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:51.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:51.100 --> 1:37:54.040\n Even Killer Mike immediately gets into this.\n\n1:37:54.040 --> 1:37:54.860\n Sell out.\n\n1:37:57.480 --> 1:38:01.140\n Yeah, but he didn't take up the responsibility.\n\n1:38:01.140 --> 1:38:02.080\n I would say.\n\n1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:02.920\n He didn't.\n\n1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:05.820\n Of going bigger.\n\n1:38:05.820 --> 1:38:07.700\n So he was speaking to the community.\n\n1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:08.540\n And he was doing what he.\n\n1:38:08.540 --> 1:38:11.240\n On this particular moment, he's exceptional at it.\n\n1:38:11.240 --> 1:38:13.640\n And he was speaking to this particular moment.\n\n1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:16.200\n He didn't take it a step farther,\n\n1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:21.200\n which is like giving the same speech,\n\n1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:23.200\n but bigger than race.\n\n1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:25.900\n Bigger than this particular moment,\n\n1:38:25.900 --> 1:38:29.420\n but more about the American project.\n\n1:38:29.420 --> 1:38:31.640\n You know the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?\n\n1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:32.480\n Yes.\n\n1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:33.320\n Yeah, there you go.\n\n1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:34.140\n That's a good example.\n\n1:38:34.140 --> 1:38:37.280\n So that guy until we screw him up\n\n1:38:38.380 --> 1:38:40.240\n is the kind of thing that I'm talking about.\n\n1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:41.160\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:42.000\n Okay.\n\n1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.520\n I mean, Jaco, maybe that's another.\n\n1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:44.600\n Jaco's pretty good.\n\n1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:45.440\n Can't really tell.\n\n1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:46.260\n Is he a Democrat?\n\n1:38:46.260 --> 1:38:47.100\n Is he a Republican?\n\n1:38:47.100 --> 1:38:47.920\n I don't know.\n\n1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:48.760\n He's an American.\n\n1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:49.600\n That's for damn sure.\n\n1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:50.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:50.420 --> 1:38:51.260\n And I think there's a lot of folks.\n\n1:38:51.260 --> 1:38:52.600\n And then, you know.\n\n1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:54.440\n No, I think Jaco, there aren't.\n\n1:38:54.440 --> 1:38:56.280\n That's one of the reasons why Jaco's so special.\n\n1:38:56.280 --> 1:38:57.120\n That's so important.\n\n1:38:57.120 --> 1:38:57.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:57.940 --> 1:39:02.940\n Your podcast, The Portal, is something in my little universe\n\n1:39:03.840 --> 1:39:06.920\n is something a lot of people really love.\n\n1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:08.440\n And it moves them.\n\n1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:11.080\n They draw a lot of meaning from it.\n\n1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:14.760\n And also, especially in difficult times.\n\n1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:21.760\n It gives them a comfort of through like this kind of,\n\n1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:23.000\n it's not just nuance.\n\n1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:26.000\n There's like, even when you're talking about chaos,\n\n1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:28.880\n there's love underneath all of it.\n\n1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:30.880\n And I think people would draw a lot of meaning from it,\n\n1:39:30.880 --> 1:39:35.880\n which is why they are wondering why you haven't been doing\n\n1:39:35.880 --> 1:39:40.880\n I'm wondering why you haven't been doing that many podcasts\n\n1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:45.240\n or you haven't done it in maybe a month and a half\n\n1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:49.360\n or two months in this most difficult of times.\n\n1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:50.900\n Is there a good reason?\n\n1:39:52.420 --> 1:39:53.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:55.120\n There are lots of good reasons.\n\n1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:58.580\n So the first one is kind of weird,\n\n1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:01.480\n which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous.\n\n1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:05.840\n And if you say, I don't want to be famous,\n\n1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:06.920\n it's like, oh, you're just saying that\n\n1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:09.120\n because you want to be everyone to think you're famous.\n\n1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:09.960\n You're not that famous.\n\n1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:10.780\n You know, okay.\n\n1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:16.780\n I don't love being as well known as I've become.\n\n1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.400\n There's lots of things that are fun about it.\n\n1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:23.080\n It's wonderful that you can go to,\n\n1:40:23.080 --> 1:40:24.400\n I can go to any city in the world\n\n1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:27.000\n and there are portal listeners there.\n\n1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:28.720\n All I need to do is put out a tweet\n\n1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:30.760\n and 20 people show up for a drink.\n\n1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:31.760\n And they're amazing people.\n\n1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:36.240\n And they're almost, I mean, you can see my live Q and A's\n\n1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:37.440\n on my Instagram page.\n\n1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:38.800\n If you go to Eric R. Weinstein,\n\n1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:40.440\n I just pick somebody randomly\n\n1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:43.080\n and I was really worried about it at first.\n\n1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:45.560\n And you know, maybe I should be worried about it,\n\n1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:47.880\n but in general, people all over the world\n\n1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:49.080\n are just so positive.\n\n1:40:49.080 --> 1:40:50.300\n And so, you know.\n\n1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:55.160\n And thoughtful and have a story that's kind of self selected.\n\n1:40:55.160 --> 1:40:56.000\n Right?\n\n1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:56.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:56.820 --> 1:40:58.080\n But I don't like the fame.\n\n1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:00.220\n The thing we just described comes with the fame.\n\n1:41:00.220 --> 1:41:01.320\n It's a beautiful thing.\n\n1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.680\n You know, you're worried that it's getting.\n\n1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:04.520\n It's ephemeral.\n\n1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:09.240\n It'll, look Lex, it'll turn on you in a heartbeat.\n\n1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:10.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:11.760\n It'll turn on you in a heartbeat.\n\n1:41:11.760 --> 1:41:14.480\n And the other problem is I don't,\n\n1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:16.940\n I don't like my audience being my audience.\n\n1:41:16.940 --> 1:41:18.080\n I want to get closer to them.\n\n1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:18.960\n I want to talk to them.\n\n1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:21.040\n I want to find out what is this doing in your life?\n\n1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:24.720\n My house fills up with art that people send me.\n\n1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:27.360\n The lightest thing is an effects pedal\n\n1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:28.760\n called something like, I don't know,\n\n1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:33.120\n bow tie overdrive from a guy in Mexico, right?\n\n1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:33.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:36.920\n You play electric, by the way, in a tiny little tangent.\n\n1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:37.840\n Do you play electric?\n\n1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:40.960\n I have a Stratocaster, but it doesn't have a strap\n\n1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:42.960\n and I don't know what to do with it and I have a bad amp.\n\n1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:46.800\n So you should, you should, you should hook me up with the.\n\n1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:48.220\n We'll find it a home maybe.\n\n1:41:48.220 --> 1:41:49.240\n Okay.\n\n1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:52.140\n You're starting to sense that this is too much.\n\n1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:54.640\n No, I want to be, I want to be here.\n\n1:41:54.640 --> 1:42:00.640\n I want to do the work very simply.\n\n1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.680\n I don't have an ability to fully explain myself.\n\n1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:06.880\n I don't want to claim that I don't love the fact that how\n\n1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:09.080\n much love do we get from these programs?\n\n1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:14.080\n Like I, the generically people are incredibly generous.\n\n1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:19.000\n You know, people have begged me, set up a Patreon account\n\n1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.960\n and I haven't been able to do it.\n\n1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:22.980\n I should do it.\n\n1:42:22.980 --> 1:42:24.320\n I've said to everybody, it's a business.\n\n1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:24.880\n It's a business.\n\n1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:28.880\n It's a business, but like they're so used to being defrauded.\n\n1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:31.600\n When somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives, my,\n\n1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:34.600\n my goal was to say, I'm going to keep talking to you about you.\n\n1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:37.480\n You wonder why I started doing ads on my show was because I\n\n1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.360\n wanted people to think from the get go, this is a business.\n\n1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:46.400\n This is what I sound like when I'm selling, but you know, like\n\n1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:49.000\n you see I've lost weight.\n\n1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.120\n A lot of that is due to athletic greens, athletic greens, you\n\n1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:57.880\n know, um, code, uh, what's the, I don't know what my promo code\n\n1:42:57.880 --> 1:43:01.720\n is for athletic greens, probably athletic greens.com slash portal,\n\n1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:05.080\n but doesn't that portal, but you know, Fitbit who doesn't\n\n1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:08.200\n advertise has also been instrumental as well as a guy\n\n1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:12.280\n named Steven Cates, who, you know, was a fan from the show,\n\n1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:14.080\n found me on the street and just said, I'm a trainer.\n\n1:43:14.080 --> 1:43:15.040\n I want to help train you.\n\n1:43:15.040 --> 1:43:18.200\n And it's got me on a, on a good, uh, good path.\n\n1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:21.880\n So, you know, that's one paid advertiser and two people on\n\n1:43:21.880 --> 1:43:24.880\n I'm calling out just because there are, you know, two, two\n\n1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:28.640\n outfits, Steven Cates and Fitbit that have changed my life.\n\n1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:30.720\n I wanted people to say, you know, you don't have to be\n\n1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:31.920\n afraid of advertising.\n\n1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:37.240\n If I do it in this way, this is powering your show, but the\n\n1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:40.400\n whole issue of money is weird because people have these crazy\n\n1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:41.680\n feelings like, Oh wow.\n\n1:43:41.680 --> 1:43:42.960\n I knew he was a shill.\n\n1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:44.960\n He's a grifter, you know?\n\n1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:45.880\n Okay.\n\n1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:46.880\n I didn't love that.\n\n1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:48.040\n I didn't love the issue.\n\n1:43:48.040 --> 1:43:50.360\n So I didn't set up a Patreon.\n\n1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:56.120\n The security issues for talking and being me are significant.\n\n1:43:56.120 --> 1:44:00.920\n And I don't have the kind of money to hire around the clock.\n\n1:44:00.920 --> 1:44:04.960\n I mean, I, I desperately want to get to a level of wealth\n\n1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:07.160\n where I don't have to think about money.\n\n1:44:07.160 --> 1:44:09.840\n I don't think it's, you know, some people want money because\n\n1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:12.240\n they, they, they need it for status.\n\n1:44:12.240 --> 1:44:16.560\n I think I can handle status if I want it doing this, I don't\n\n1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:18.360\n want the status necessarily.\n\n1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:21.880\n And I don't want, I'd want the status, but I don't want the\n\n1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:23.040\n fame that goes with it.\n\n1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:25.480\n I want the money.\n\n1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:28.720\n I don't want to be seen as this is about money because it's\n\n1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:32.840\n about a substance and drink, you know, all of those things.\n\n1:44:33.120 --> 1:44:36.520\n That's part of, I haven't solved these issues.\n\n1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:39.960\n I've been feeling bad because people say, where's the portal\n\n1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:40.160\n work?\n\n1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:40.720\n We're desperate.\n\n1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:41.800\n These are difficult times.\n\n1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:45.120\n We have an election coming up and it's just like, do you\n\n1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:48.160\n think for a moment that I want to explain that I actually got\n\n1:44:48.160 --> 1:44:50.440\n really uncomfortable being as well known as I was?\n\n1:44:50.440 --> 1:44:51.600\n And then what is it that I want?\n\n1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.360\n Because I want to be better known and less well known at\n\n1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:55.000\n the same time.\n\n1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.880\n It doesn't, there's nothing the audience can do.\n\n1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:58.320\n I don't want the audience to be the audience.\n\n1:44:58.320 --> 1:44:59.640\n That doesn't make sense to people.\n\n1:44:59.640 --> 1:45:02.560\n I want it to be a business, but I don't think people need to\n\n1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:04.920\n fear a business of the businesses open about being a\n\n1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:09.400\n business that, and then that's all to the side, what you're\n\n1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:13.920\n seeing now in front of the election is an incredibly\n\n1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:20.160\n meta violent period in our online existence, and I believe\n\n1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:23.280\n that anybody who attempts to say these two parties are\n\n1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:25.720\n completely screwed at the moment.\n\n1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:29.160\n The leadership of these parties is unsalvageable, unworkable.\n\n1:45:30.200 --> 1:45:33.080\n Everyone hears that from inside the two party system.\n\n1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:34.720\n Oh, I get it.\n\n1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:36.720\n He's trying to subtract votes off of Biden.\n\n1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:37.360\n Oh, I get it.\n\n1:45:37.400 --> 1:45:38.560\n He's trying to scuttle Trump.\n\n1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:39.960\n Oh, I get it.\n\n1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:42.840\n This is a play for his show because he's trying to plug\n\n1:45:42.840 --> 1:45:46.560\n in to discuss there's a bill Hicks routine on marketing.\n\n1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:48.960\n Have you ever seen this brilliant?\n\n1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:53.200\n I recommend it to everyone where he comes out on stage and\n\n1:45:53.200 --> 1:45:55.480\n he says, are there any people in marketing and sales in the\n\n1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:55.880\n audience?\n\n1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:56.720\n Woo.\n\n1:45:56.720 --> 1:45:57.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:57.240 --> 1:45:58.560\n It's like, okay, great.\n\n1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:00.640\n Can you do us all a favor and die?\n\n1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:02.160\n And like, everybody laughs.\n\n1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:04.120\n He's like, no, I'm not laughing.\n\n1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:05.160\n I'm seeing being serious.\n\n1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:06.920\n So he's talked about how marketing is horrible.\n\n1:46:07.280 --> 1:46:09.040\n So you're like, where's this act going?\n\n1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:11.160\n Then he gets to the point of it.\n\n1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:15.120\n It's like, oh, I know how you marketing people think bills\n\n1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.560\n going after that, uh, resentment dollar.\n\n1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:18.520\n That's good dollar.\n\n1:46:18.600 --> 1:46:20.520\n Let's get that resentment anti marketing dollar.\n\n1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:20.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:21.840\n It's like, no, that's not what I'm saying.\n\n1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:22.840\n I really hate marketers.\n\n1:46:23.200 --> 1:46:23.800\n Oh, that's good.\n\n1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.080\n It's the authenticity dollar.\n\n1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:31.040\n You can't escape this kind of negative marketing thought.\n\n1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:36.840\n And I guess that gets to the issue that I don't want to be\n\n1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:41.960\n destroyed in advance of this election. I don't think it's a\n\n1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:47.400\n good use of my relationship to my audience to be broadcasting\n\n1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:50.960\n how completely ridiculous Donald Trump and Joe Biden are as\n\n1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:53.040\n candidates for the president of the United States.\n\n1:46:53.040 --> 1:46:53.760\n Full stop.\n\n1:46:54.120 --> 1:46:55.600\n None of this makes any sense.\n\n1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:59.160\n These moderators of these pseudo debates were in the wrong\n\n1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:00.880\n format with the wrong people.\n\n1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:04.240\n No part of this makes a wit of sense.\n\n1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:07.200\n Can I try to push back several claims?\n\n1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:15.720\n One is I don't believe the systems as they stand now can\n\n1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:20.160\n destroy their equine voice, the voice you're a child.\n\n1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:24.520\n I'm sorry to say that, but, well, let me, well, it's also\n\n1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:28.280\n possible. It's entirely possible that you're the child.\n\n1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:29.160\n Okay.\n\n1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:33.120\n Because a child would say you would call other people a child.\n\n1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:40.800\n Yeah. Get in the first blow reveal the tell because the only\n\n1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:43.840\n power they have is to attack you psychologically.\n\n1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:44.360\n No.\n\n1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:51.320\n Well, I believe that the army of people that love you is much\n\n1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:57.280\n more powerful than mainstream media, than people that you\n\n1:47:57.280 --> 1:47:59.920\n might hear it say ridiculous things that you just said,\n\n1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:05.400\n which has tried to reduce you, like the marketing thinking.\n\n1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:07.600\n I just believe there's an army.\n\n1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:12.640\n Maybe there's a better term of people that see you for who\n\n1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:16.680\n you are and a hungry, like I'm not disputing those things.\n\n1:48:17.160 --> 1:48:21.120\n And what I'm saying, I would venture to say as your therapist\n\n1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:28.400\n that you're actually, uh, the battle is all in your mind.\n\n1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:33.600\n All in your mind that you have found these demons in the\n\n1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:39.120\n system, and they're just a tiny minority and it's all in your\n\n1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:42.400\n mind. They cannot actually remove.\n\n1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:47.920\n They're not strong enough to remove the voice of Eric Weinstein\n\n1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:49.040\n to silence the voice.\n\n1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:50.080\n I love this.\n\n1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:55.480\n This is some of the best fiction writing I've ever heard.\n\n1:48:55.480 --> 1:49:00.360\n Let me tell you, I have relatives who've known me my entire\n\n1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:04.040\n life, where one article in the New York Times, they will\n\n1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:04.960\n believe that over me.\n\n1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.720\n My contention is that it has no power except to affect your\n\n1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:13.600\n psychology. What you have to do is the Rogan thing, which is\n\n1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:15.240\n laugh. Just laugh.\n\n1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:16.680\n I am laughing.\n\n1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:18.040\n I know, but more.\n\n1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.040\n I'm telling you something.\n\n1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:20.360\n Yes.\n\n1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:20.800\n Okay.\n\n1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:23.640\n The way this works is through ruin.\n\n1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:27.480\n Ruin can come to anyone.\n\n1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:29.320\n There's no one who cannot be ruined.\n\n1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:35.400\n Every single person is signed up right now to be ruined by\n\n1:49:35.400 --> 1:49:35.960\n the system.\n\n1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:40.520\n Don't you understand that you have more power than the system?\n\n1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:42.760\n You can ruin the system.\n\n1:49:42.760 --> 1:49:45.480\n Your Twitter account, the podcast.\n\n1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.560\n I'm telling you about the Army.\n\n1:49:47.560 --> 1:49:50.000\n I agree that my Twitter account, my pocket.\n\n1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:53.000\n But what we've seen, for example, you saw what happened\n\n1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.840\n to Brett's Articles of Unity project.\n\n1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:55.840\n Yes.\n\n1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:56.360\n Okay.\n\n1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:59.920\n What happened on the Twitter side?\n\n1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:00.520\n What happened?\n\n1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:03.160\n What happened?\n\n1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:05.120\n Well, actually, say the word and say the word.\n\n1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:07.800\n It was blocked or removed from Twitter.\n\n1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:08.280\n Suspended.\n\n1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:09.400\n Account suspended.\n\n1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:14.360\n And I have a direct line to Jack.\n\n1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:14.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:15.240\n Okay.\n\n1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:20.160\n So I'm talking to the CEO who I am crazy enough to still\n\n1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:20.680\n believe in.\n\n1:50:20.680 --> 1:50:21.800\n Good.\n\n1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:22.520\n I do, too.\n\n1:50:22.520 --> 1:50:25.720\n I believe somehow there's a very strange thing going on\n\n1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:27.200\n with Jack Dorsey.\n\n1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.800\n I cannot possibly reconcile the actions with the person I've...\n\n1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:37.000\n That is a next level mind in there.\n\n1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.800\n I don't know it well enough to say that it's all next level.\n\n1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.880\n I'm not claiming he doesn't have any blind spots.\n\n1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:43.840\n Every smart person I know has blind spots.\n\n1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:44.880\n I don't know what he's up against.\n\n1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:46.600\n Blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:50.040\n There's no way that the Jack Dorsey that I've talked to and\n\n1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:53.720\n the Jack Dorsey that interacted over Articles of Unity can be\n\n1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:55.400\n the same person.\n\n1:50:55.400 --> 1:50:58.040\n He is constrained by that company in some way that\n\n1:50:58.040 --> 1:50:59.320\n doesn't make sense to me.\n\n1:50:59.320 --> 1:51:01.640\n Either that or he's the most duplicitous person on earth and\n\n1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:02.560\n I'm not believing it.\n\n1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:03.560\n I just don't buy it.\n\n1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:04.480\n Okay?\n\n1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:05.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:07.240\n Something horrible is happening.\n\n1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:14.560\n My claim is I can remove you functionally from the chessboard\n\n1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:18.600\n in a tiny number of moves, no matter who you are, no matter\n\n1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:21.400\n how virtuous or how much of a bastard you've been your entire\n\n1:51:21.400 --> 1:51:25.120\n life, it doesn't take more than three or four moves to\n\n1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:27.800\n basically neuter you as a force.\n\n1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:28.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.520\n And I disagree that if that's possible, that means I'm not\n\n1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:32.840\n very good at chess.\n\n1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:36.680\n Like Unity 2020 was removed from Twitter because it's not\n\n1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:39.720\n good enough, not within the system.\n\n1:51:39.720 --> 1:51:45.080\n Like the army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea\n\n1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:46.400\n was too small.\n\n1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:49.600\n Okay, but fear, uncertainty and doubt is the name of the\n\n1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:51.040\n game, the coin of the realm.\n\n1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:53.680\n Psychology though, it's not real power.\n\n1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:55.160\n It just affects the mind.\n\n1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:57.800\n Okay, I have a reading assignment for you because you're\n\n1:51:57.800 --> 1:52:01.240\n Russian, you'll really enjoy this.\n\n1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:04.920\n As part of the great American tobacco settlement, the Tobacco\n\n1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:08.200\n Institute had to disgorge its archives of all of its\n\n1:52:08.200 --> 1:52:11.680\n strategies, all of its skullduggery and put it on the\n\n1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:15.600\n web for all time so that we can all understand how the tobacco\n\n1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:19.960\n companies got together and destroyed people, right?\n\n1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:22.520\n You see tobacco destroys people.\n\n1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:26.160\n You can see, you know, Scientology destroys people.\n\n1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:31.680\n There are various vindictive organizations that will not\n\n1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:36.880\n tolerate reality in opposition to them.\n\n1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:38.480\n Let's take them down.\n\n1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:39.080\n Okay.\n\n1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:40.320\n That's what I'm trying to tell you is...\n\n1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:41.440\n Okay, no.\n\n1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:43.840\n So why aren't you doing the podcast to return?\n\n1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:49.240\n Because that's one of the weapons of war.\n\n1:52:49.240 --> 1:52:52.680\n Well, first of all, if you're at war, I don't want to\n\n1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:57.880\n discuss strategy on a podcast, right?\n\n1:52:57.880 --> 1:52:59.120\n But that's your misunderstanding.\n\n1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:01.960\n What did Montgomery say about Rommel?\n\n1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:06.120\n But wasn't his line, I read your book, you beautiful bastard.\n\n1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:07.760\n It's like, why are you using the tactics that you\n\n1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:09.560\n already explained?\n\n1:53:09.560 --> 1:53:10.120\n Okay.\n\n1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:13.000\n So one of the things I'm doing is I'm not having a strategic\n\n1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.360\n conversation with you and several hundred thousand of\n\n1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:20.360\n our closest friends.\n\n1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:27.280\n I pulled back because this is not the battle that I know\n\n1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:28.640\n what I'm doing.\n\n1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:31.880\n I do not feel passionately enough about defeating Donald\n\n1:53:31.880 --> 1:53:34.760\n Trump to elect Joe Biden, even if that's the way I'm going\n\n1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:39.760\n to ultimately vote, right?\n\n1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:42.560\n I don't believe in the Biden Democratic Party.\n\n1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:45.360\n I don't believe in the Trump Republican Party.\n\n1:53:45.360 --> 1:53:48.480\n So, yes, it's an incredibly consequential election.\n\n1:53:48.480 --> 1:53:52.000\n But to me, it's like the Crips and the Bloods and the Latin\n\n1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:56.720\n Kings fighting over the right to extort a business and the\n\n1:53:56.720 --> 1:54:00.520\n business trying to figure out who it wants to do the extorting.\n\n1:54:00.520 --> 1:54:03.360\n But don't you think, listen, there's very few people that\n\n1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:05.760\n are as good with the English language as you.\n\n1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:12.000\n Don't you think it's possible to draw a line in between that\n\n1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:18.520\n finds how we find our common humanity that ensures a better\n\n1:54:18.520 --> 1:54:23.520\n 2021 without having to say like Donald Trump is evil or Joe\n\n1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:27.240\n Biden is incompetent or any of that, just somehow draw a\n\n1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:28.240\n beautiful line?\n\n1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:30.520\n I am seeing people in so much pain.\n\n1:54:30.520 --> 1:54:34.320\n This election is chewing up the integrity of everyone who\n\n1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:36.840\n comments on it, Lex.\n\n1:54:36.840 --> 1:54:38.280\n Maybe they're not good enough.\n\n1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.280\n They're not good enough.\n\n1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:41.600\n No, but the hope is...\n\n1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:42.600\n Do you believe in me?\n\n1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:43.600\n Yes.\n\n1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:44.600\n You do?\n\n1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:45.600\n Yes.\n\n1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:46.880\n Listen to me very carefully.\n\n1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:51.040\n My spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me to survive\n\n1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:56.240\n in the space, I've been mouthing off since the 80s, tells me\n\n1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:01.520\n this is a super dangerous time for smart people to be spending\n\n1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:06.920\n the dry powder because the election doesn't make sense.\n\n1:55:06.920 --> 1:55:09.640\n Doesn't mean that I don't have a sense that one outcome would\n\n1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.400\n be better than the other probably, but the variance on\n\n1:55:12.400 --> 1:55:16.040\n that, I'm not even positive that I'm right.\n\n1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:20.040\n These two options are so completely inappropriate to the\n\n1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:22.640\n world of 2020.\n\n1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:26.040\n What we need is so diametrically opposed to more boomers and\n\n1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:30.460\n more silent generation people trying to sort out a highly\n\n1:55:30.460 --> 1:55:36.160\n technical world being mediated through social media.\n\n1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.760\n We need more exclusion.\n\n1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:39.880\n We need more actual elites.\n\n1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:42.400\n The people we've called the elites are not the elite.\n\n1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:43.400\n They need to go.\n\n1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:44.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:55:44.400 --> 1:55:45.880\n We need excellence, competence.\n\n1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:49.440\n We need people who can be trusted behind closed doors and we need\n\n1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:55.040\n to close the doors so we can't see what those people are doing.\n\n1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.040\n Here's the thing.\n\n1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:59.680\n Imagine that you had a bunch of people who'd all seen action\n\n1:55:59.680 --> 1:56:03.560\n in combat, had all volunteered to be part of the armed services,\n\n1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:06.160\n had all come from backgrounds where they didn't need to.\n\n1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:09.040\n So you were convinced that these people had put their lives on\n\n1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:12.680\n the line for their country, not for a payday.\n\n1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:15.520\n Imagine you had 10 of these people with technical backgrounds,\n\n1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:22.360\n men, women, black, white, Muslim, Jew, doesn't matter.\n\n1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:26.880\n I would trust those people and I'd close the door.\n\n1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:29.200\n I don't want to know what they talked about.\n\n1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:33.440\n I don't want transparency into all of their negotiations.\n\n1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:36.640\n I want to know that they're patriotic, that they see something in the world\n\n1:56:36.640 --> 1:56:40.080\n bigger than themselves and their family fortunes.\n\n1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:42.400\n I want to know that they're courageous.\n\n1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:45.920\n I want to know that they've got all of our well being and I'm willing\n\n1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:46.920\n to roll the dice.\n\n1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:49.720\n And if they screw us over, I'd rather go down like that.\n\n1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:50.720\n Okay.\n\n1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:53.680\n So I disagree with you there because there's a difference in those\n\n1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:59.480\n and Jocko because you're not speaking to people with credentials.\n\n1:56:59.480 --> 1:57:02.480\n No, I'm talking about self credentialed people.\n\n1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:04.600\n I view Jocko as self credentialed.\n\n1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:08.440\n But the biggest, the powerful thing about Jocko is he's not only self credentialed,\n\n1:57:08.440 --> 1:57:12.840\n but he's been real with people.\n\n1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:17.920\n The magical thing about Jocko isn't his book, isn't his life story is he's been\n\n1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:21.760\n talking on a podcast for a long, there's something real that happens.\n\n1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:22.760\n Okay.\n\n1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:28.000\n So if you took everybody, if you took Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard and you took\n\n1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:35.360\n Jocko Willing and maybe Jesse Ventura, right, you can take, you can take Bernie\n\n1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:36.360\n Sanders.\n\n1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:37.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:38.840\n Who's, you know, a lone voice.\n\n1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:45.080\n You take all of these people who've like really just risked, like why do we trust?\n\n1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.920\n Why is Katherine Hepburn the best that Hollywood ever produced?\n\n1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:54.240\n Because she told Hollywood to go fuck itself hard.\n\n1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:58.200\n They gave her four Academy awards and she said, love you, sweeties.\n\n1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:01.560\n I'm going to use them as the doorstop for the bathrooms in my house.\n\n1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:02.560\n See that skill.\n\n1:58:02.560 --> 1:58:05.320\n That's, uh, that's, that's just, that's what you were talking about.\n\n1:58:05.320 --> 1:58:06.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:06.320 --> 1:58:07.320\n Be Katherine Hepburn.\n\n1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:11.640\n Audrey Hepburn is pretty amazing, but Katherine Hepburn is next level.\n\n1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:12.640\n Right?\n\n1:58:12.640 --> 1:58:14.680\n Well, you, I mean, that's what you're trying to say to me.\n\n1:58:14.680 --> 1:58:15.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:15.680 --> 1:58:16.680\n Okay.\n\n1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:17.680\n I'm trying to figure it out, Lex.\n\n1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:18.680\n Okay.\n\n1:58:18.680 --> 1:58:19.680\n I don't have the answer yet.\n\n1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:23.760\n What I do know is that this election is chewing people up and I mean two separate things.\n\n1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:29.080\n One that parties don't have enough integrity that if you comment either for or against,\n\n1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:33.440\n there's a short sequence where you make a comment that's nuanced.\n\n1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:36.320\n You get referenced to something, right?\n\n1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:41.640\n Like, you know, take this thing about, you know, find people on both sides.\n\n1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:49.080\n That is non resolved after N years, whether the context should be reported or not.\n\n1:58:49.080 --> 1:58:55.060\n We are in some situation in which Democrats and Republicans are primed to fight each other.\n\n1:58:55.060 --> 1:58:59.760\n The way introducing two ants from two different ant colonies always produces a battle.\n\n1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:00.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:01.760\n Okay.\n\n1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:07.400\n I don't want to be in that fray because those people are going to kill each other mindlessly\n\n1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:08.920\n like robots.\n\n1:59:08.920 --> 1:59:13.720\n And until the election is concluded, like I, do I think this is dire?\n\n1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:14.720\n Yes.\n\n1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:15.720\n Could it be make or break?\n\n1:59:15.720 --> 1:59:16.720\n Absolutely.\n\n1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:17.720\n I'm not saying that.\n\n1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:18.720\n Do I know which way this goes?\n\n1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:22.520\n I can make an excellent argument that we need to elect Joe Biden right now.\n\n1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:26.840\n We've got a situation which can only be cured by voting for Joe Biden.\n\n1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:31.240\n I can make another argument that we could have a situation that can only be cured by\n\n1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:33.620\n defeating Joe Biden right now.\n\n1:59:33.620 --> 1:59:37.400\n And all of the things that the modern democratic party represents.\n\n1:59:37.400 --> 1:59:38.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:44.740\n I don't have, you know, it's, it's not the lady and the tiger we're choosing between\n\n1:59:44.740 --> 1:59:45.980\n the tiger and the tiger.\n\n1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:48.920\n It's the Sumatran tiger versus the Siberian tiger, right?\n\n1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:54.400\n I'm trying to think, well, which tiger can I, do I have a better chance against, um,\n\n1:59:54.400 --> 2:00:00.440\n the key problem for us politically is that we have to divorce the concept of the center\n\n2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:04.040\n and moderation from kleptocracy.\n\n2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:08.300\n Every time we try to say something like we need more moderate solutions, we need more\n\n2:00:08.300 --> 2:00:10.120\n pluralistic solution.\n\n2:00:10.120 --> 2:00:14.540\n People will say, wow, you just want to hand us right back into the swamp, don't you?\n\n2:00:14.540 --> 2:00:20.740\n The swamp people cause the moderates and the swamp people are the same people, right?\n\n2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:23.200\n So then we have these two crazy wings.\n\n2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.320\n We can't have crazy right wing people.\n\n2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:27.880\n I don't want any Tiki torch BS.\n\n2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:29.560\n We can't have crazy left wing.\n\n2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:32.000\n Don't attack my courthouse.\n\n2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:35.240\n Really don't attack my courthouse and we can't have moderates.\n\n2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:39.480\n It's like, okay, how do we install our children and, and rape pillage and get these speaking\n\n2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:44.680\n fees when we're out of office and become, you know, cozy with the things when we're\n\n2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.240\n supposed to be regulating them and then, you know, become their lobbyists, you know, immediately\n\n2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:54.120\n when we leave office, all of this stuff, we need an entirely different system.\n\n2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:57.200\n And I can't talk about that at the moment.\n\n2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:01.080\n When I talk, people say, oh wow, so you're going to sit this one out cause you're a pussy\n\n2:01:01.080 --> 2:01:02.760\n because you're a coward.\n\n2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:03.760\n Great to know Eric.\n\n2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:06.160\n We thought better of you by click.\n\n2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.500\n I don't know what to do.\n\n2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:10.440\n But are you thinking of what to do?\n\n2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:11.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:13.680\n Oh, you better believe it.\n\n2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:20.440\n Look, Brett, Brett had this idea of unity 2020 and I told him it was a wrong idea.\n\n2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:23.160\n I didn't tell him that unity 2024 was a wrong idea.\n\n2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:25.860\n I didn't tell him that unity 2028 is a wrong idea.\n\n2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:29.360\n And if I were to make the case that he was right and I was wrong, cause he's now shuttered\n\n2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:31.840\n the thing, right?\n\n2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:36.200\n I would say that the case to be made that he was correct was, is that by doing this\n\n2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:39.500\n in 2020, we found out what we were up against.\n\n2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:43.940\n It's good to know that Twitter can turn this off at the drop of a hat.\n\n2:01:43.940 --> 2:01:45.200\n Great to know.\n\n2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:53.140\n It's good to know as we learned that you cannot have meetings of vice of presidential candidates\n\n2:01:53.140 --> 2:01:59.620\n in a primary that are not approved of by the party, right?\n\n2:01:59.620 --> 2:02:03.180\n Like they've got this thing figured out so we don't have any way in.\n\n2:02:03.180 --> 2:02:09.560\n And now unity 2024 makes sense because unity 2020 was tried.\n\n2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:10.560\n Okay.\n\n2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.400\n I don't know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances and some we do and some we don't.\n\n2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:20.620\n There's, there's a game theoretic thing that I'm not sure you're accounting for, but you,\n\n2:02:20.620 --> 2:02:21.620\n you probably are.\n\n2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:32.700\n But let me just make an argument is Jack Dorsey very likely listens to your podcasts and wait,\n\n2:02:32.700 --> 2:02:34.700\n this is the power of these words.\n\n2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:41.980\n Something deep went wrong, but we can change it with the power of words.\n\n2:02:41.980 --> 2:02:44.060\n Something went wrong at Twitter.\n\n2:02:44.060 --> 2:02:46.100\n They have so much division on their platform.\n\n2:02:46.100 --> 2:02:47.180\n That's what I'm trying to say.\n\n2:02:47.180 --> 2:02:48.620\n They've gotten, it's not wrong.\n\n2:02:48.620 --> 2:02:50.460\n They just don't know they're understaffed.\n\n2:02:50.460 --> 2:02:53.900\n No, they have an insoluble problem.\n\n2:02:53.900 --> 2:02:54.900\n Difficult to solve.\n\n2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:55.900\n They have an insoluble problem.\n\n2:02:55.900 --> 2:03:00.580\n This is where you and I disagree because, well, all right, I'd like to create a competitor.\n\n2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:05.860\n So then, you know, give it to me, create the competitor, show me that you actually have\n\n2:03:05.860 --> 2:03:10.100\n understood this because my guess is, is that most of the things that you'll think about,\n\n2:03:10.100 --> 2:03:13.580\n I mean, I can tell you things I've talked to Jack about, which I know would make Twitter\n\n2:03:13.580 --> 2:03:15.580\n much better.\n\n2:03:15.580 --> 2:03:23.220\n However, I, I think that this problem of instantaneous communication across the planet and you subtract\n\n2:03:23.220 --> 2:03:28.380\n off all sorts of context and mutual self knowledge, the problem is us.\n\n2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:29.940\n It's not the platforms.\n\n2:03:29.940 --> 2:03:34.500\n We're thinking about a technological solution and I'm saying the problem is, is that we\n\n2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:37.140\n are ultimately the product.\n\n2:03:37.140 --> 2:03:40.140\n And I just disagree with that and there's a lot of, that's probably could save that\n\n2:03:40.140 --> 2:03:41.140\n for tomorrow.\n\n2:03:41.140 --> 2:03:47.060\n I look forward to spending summers in your villa when you, when you debut this product\n\n2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:50.580\n and I would love to angel invest in it.\n\n2:03:50.580 --> 2:03:54.860\n By the way, in terms of money, I'll never have a villa.\n\n2:03:54.860 --> 2:03:55.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:55.860 --> 2:03:58.500\n No, I will always give away everything I own.\n\n2:03:58.500 --> 2:04:01.460\n No, sorry.\n\n2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:06.420\n Invest into like things like you mentioned, awesome things.\n\n2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:12.620\n Invest fine, but a little bit of a vuncular advice.\n\n2:04:12.620 --> 2:04:20.340\n Don't pledge to be the person who disgorges themselves of security.\n\n2:04:20.340 --> 2:04:21.900\n Money is freedom.\n\n2:04:21.900 --> 2:04:22.900\n That's what it is.\n\n2:04:22.900 --> 2:04:25.700\n It's a big hunking pile of freedom.\n\n2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:26.700\n Okay.\n\n2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:30.460\n You can choose to use it as the freedom to imprison you if you don't, you know, so you\n\n2:04:30.460 --> 2:04:33.740\n can use it as freedom to make yourself a prisoner of your money.\n\n2:04:33.740 --> 2:04:39.740\n But generally speaking, Lex money is freedom and your voice is important.\n\n2:04:39.740 --> 2:04:46.260\n At least retain the amount of money security you need to follow Joe's advice.\n\n2:04:46.260 --> 2:04:51.460\n What is the point of f you money if you don't say f you, the number of people who have f\n\n2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:56.260\n you money who don't say f you indicates the number of people who chose the freedom of\n\n2:04:56.260 --> 2:04:59.140\n their wealth to create a prison.\n\n2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:03.980\n They built a prison with the freedom they had and they walked into it, locked the door.\n\n2:05:03.980 --> 2:05:06.640\n I think it's too difficult not to create it.\n\n2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:09.820\n The reason I want to give away the money is because I just know my own psychology and\n\n2:05:09.820 --> 2:05:11.980\n you create prisons.\n\n2:05:11.980 --> 2:05:19.780\n Our human mind just creates those prisons that f you money is enough for basic shelter\n\n2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:20.780\n and basic food.\n\n2:05:20.780 --> 2:05:23.680\n That's, that's the optimal if you don't have kids yet.\n\n2:05:23.680 --> 2:05:25.860\n This is a, okay, this is the problem.\n\n2:05:25.860 --> 2:05:26.860\n This is why I'm sitting.\n\n2:05:26.860 --> 2:05:32.800\n So this is me, single Lex speaking, but future Lex, future Lex.\n\n2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:38.180\n I'm talking to future Lex, single, single present Lex, please don't listen.\n\n2:05:38.180 --> 2:05:39.180\n Don't be an ass.\n\n2:05:39.180 --> 2:05:44.540\n You're going to need some money and don't make these pledges to say on a podcast.\n\n2:05:44.540 --> 2:05:47.020\n I'm saying I want to save you from yourself.\n\n2:05:47.020 --> 2:05:51.940\n You need money to do many of the beautiful things that we're counting on you to do.\n\n2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:56.860\n Don't F it up.\n\n2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:58.780\n Can I talk to you about Roger Penrose?\n\n2:05:58.780 --> 2:05:59.780\n Sure.\n\n2:05:59.780 --> 2:06:05.740\n You've talked to Roger on the portal, but also in between the lines and offline, just\n\n2:06:05.740 --> 2:06:09.660\n everything you've said about Roger Penrose for people who don't know.\n\n2:06:09.660 --> 2:06:18.200\n He just recently, a few days ago, won the 2020 shared the 2020 Nobel prize for physics,\n\n2:06:18.200 --> 2:06:24.500\n but it's clear to me that he had like a deep personal impact on you, a connection with\n\n2:06:24.500 --> 2:06:30.720\n you in terms of both your love of mathematics, just the way you see the world.\n\n2:06:30.720 --> 2:06:32.660\n This is the Eddie Van Halen conversation.\n\n2:06:32.660 --> 2:06:36.060\n This was clearly somebody who's profound in your worldview.\n\n2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:38.020\n Can you talk about Roger?\n\n2:06:38.020 --> 2:06:43.380\n Can you talk about what it means that he won this highest of prizes just in general?\n\n2:06:43.380 --> 2:06:44.380\n Let's celebrate the man.\n\n2:06:44.380 --> 2:06:45.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:45.380 --> 2:06:46.380\n Okay.\n\n2:06:46.380 --> 2:06:47.980\n So first of all, there are two other people who won this prize.\n\n2:06:47.980 --> 2:06:48.980\n I'm sorry.\n\n2:06:48.980 --> 2:06:54.380\n I just didn't happen to know who they were before they won.\n\n2:06:54.380 --> 2:07:02.340\n Roger is a very, it is not Roger in particular, but the class from which Roger comes that\n\n2:07:02.340 --> 2:07:04.340\n is so important.\n\n2:07:04.340 --> 2:07:14.740\n So I would put Roger in the class of Feynman, Einstein, Dirac, Yang, um, put Whitten in\n\n2:07:14.740 --> 2:07:15.740\n there.\n\n2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:24.700\n I mean, Whitten is a special case, but Whitten is weirdly the reverse of the Roger Penrose\n\n2:07:24.700 --> 2:07:25.700\n story, right?\n\n2:07:25.700 --> 2:07:29.580\n Because Whitten is the first physicist to win a mathematical Fields Medal, the highest\n\n2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:32.100\n honor in mathematics.\n\n2:07:32.100 --> 2:07:36.140\n Penrose is in some sense, a mathematician who's now won the Nobel prize.\n\n2:07:36.140 --> 2:07:41.700\n So it's a perfect sort of a couplet.\n\n2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:45.460\n Roger's class means everything to me.\n\n2:07:45.460 --> 2:07:48.300\n That's the highest achievement of the human mind.\n\n2:07:48.300 --> 2:07:56.060\n I would probably throw Bach in with Feynman and Dirac and company, right?\n\n2:07:56.060 --> 2:07:59.400\n I think that he was so inventive.\n\n2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:01.700\n It was very frustrating to watch this career.\n\n2:08:01.700 --> 2:08:06.140\n It was a little bit frustrating to watch Feynman's career.\n\n2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:14.620\n Feynman was so good and had he been born slightly different and a slightly different time, I\n\n2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:21.460\n believe his claim on physics would be far greater.\n\n2:08:21.460 --> 2:08:26.240\n I feel like Penrose in some sense came up a very difficult path because you see Einstein\n\n2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:30.500\n effectively solved most of the most important problems in general relativity right at the\n\n2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:32.060\n beginning.\n\n2:08:32.060 --> 2:08:36.720\n As a result, the children of Einstein are impoverished because there wasn't as much\n\n2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:39.700\n to pick off of the trees and sell at the market.\n\n2:08:39.700 --> 2:08:44.600\n Whereas Bohr and Planck didn't do nearly as good of a job with quantum theory.\n\n2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:47.260\n So there's lots to do in quantum theory.\n\n2:08:47.260 --> 2:08:55.980\n I think that Roger affected me personally by a diagram that I saw in a paper of Herman\n\n2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:58.220\n Gluck at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n2:08:58.220 --> 2:09:04.860\n It was the first picture I'd ever seen of the Hopf vibration sketched and that weirdly\n\n2:09:04.860 --> 2:09:10.340\n I brought that to the Rogan program in order to sort of convey the wonder.\n\n2:09:10.340 --> 2:09:14.300\n It was recapitulating my own journey.\n\n2:09:14.300 --> 2:09:21.020\n I think I probably saw that at like age 16 or something and it just flipped my mind.\n\n2:09:21.020 --> 2:09:26.980\n Roger is incredibly visual, he's incredibly geometric, he's incredibly sui generis, he\n\n2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:29.340\n just does his own thing.\n\n2:09:29.340 --> 2:09:31.220\n He's got lots of bets.\n\n2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:36.500\n None of them had really come through the way you would hope and I think they stretched\n\n2:09:36.500 --> 2:09:38.860\n the rules to be blunt about it.\n\n2:09:38.860 --> 2:09:39.860\n To give him the prize.\n\n2:09:39.860 --> 2:09:40.860\n Yeah, I do.\n\n2:09:40.860 --> 2:09:46.140\n You said this thing on Twitter which is beautiful that every once in a while comes a human being\n\n2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:52.700\n that gives value to the prize versus the prize giving value to the human.\n\n2:09:52.700 --> 2:09:54.060\n Two different kinds of prizes.\n\n2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:59.340\n The reason that we care about the Nobel Prize isn't because of Alfred Nobel.\n\n2:09:59.340 --> 2:10:10.460\n It's because it came along at the right time to reward Einstein, Dirac, Schrodinger, Feynman.\n\n2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:15.160\n Most of the people who should have won, won.\n\n2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.700\n Most of the awards are not good in the sense that they don't really follow.\n\n2:10:21.700 --> 2:10:26.820\n The prize is used to rewrite history, that's the problem.\n\n2:10:26.820 --> 2:10:30.760\n You should have a love hate relationship with it because on the one hand it does focus the\n\n2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:35.140\n world on what really matters and on the other hand it distorts what really matters and both\n\n2:10:35.140 --> 2:10:38.120\n of those functions take place simultaneously.\n\n2:10:38.120 --> 2:10:44.700\n In this case, I think that they violated their own rules slightly so it wasn't really clearly\n\n2:10:44.700 --> 2:10:50.540\n a case of a prediction and a discovery in the typical fashion.\n\n2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:56.420\n We better give this award to somebody of that highest caliber to make sure that the prize\n\n2:10:56.420 --> 2:10:59.980\n is fully funded with prestige going forward.\n\n2:10:59.980 --> 2:11:04.420\n That's sort of my weird speculative guess as to what happened.\n\n2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:10.900\n So Roger's getting on in years and the person should be alive so I think they bent the rules\n\n2:11:10.900 --> 2:11:14.700\n and I think they couldn't have bent it for a better person and I hope they will not bend\n\n2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:18.580\n the rules out of weakness but out of strength in the future.\n\n2:11:18.580 --> 2:11:26.140\n It would be great to get Madame Wu and Emmy Nerder a posthumous prize along with Doug\n\n2:11:26.140 --> 2:11:35.060\n Prasher, George Sudarshan and George Zweig as well as Ernst Stuckelberg Nobel Prizes.\n\n2:11:35.060 --> 2:11:42.780\n There have been some terrible omissions, the first two being females who revolutionized\n\n2:11:42.780 --> 2:11:50.300\n our view of the world and I take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes for people\n\n2:11:50.300 --> 2:11:55.320\n from ethnic groups or genders or whatever in order to make it plural and inclusive.\n\n2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:59.900\n If it's not following the work and I feel very clear that in a few cases we know there\n\n2:11:59.900 --> 2:12:06.220\n was a real problem with the Nobel committee because we have stunning accomplishments and\n\n2:12:06.220 --> 2:12:11.460\n try to get through a day as a physicist with that Nerder's theorem and try to imagine the\n\n2:12:11.460 --> 2:12:16.500\n universe without Madame Wu's discovery that left and right don't appear to be symmetric.\n\n2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:23.460\n I mean these are terrible omissions and they're a huge blot on science for not being more\n\n2:12:23.460 --> 2:12:25.540\n inclusive when it matters.\n\n2:12:25.540 --> 2:12:30.300\n Yeah so just like you said the Nobel Prize is plagued by omissions as much as...\n\n2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:31.620\n And distortions and dilutions.\n\n2:12:31.620 --> 2:12:35.940\n For example, Dirac and Schrodinger were I believe given the prize in the same year.\n\n2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:39.380\n There's no reason that those two people needed to dilute each other.\n\n2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:45.660\n The same thing with you know Dyson was an omission, Tominaga probably got included in\n\n2:12:45.660 --> 2:12:50.260\n part because we had an opportunity to show that something had happened on both sides\n\n2:12:50.260 --> 2:12:53.780\n of the Pacific after the war.\n\n2:12:53.780 --> 2:13:00.500\n But I don't think we needed to dilute Weinberg or Feynman or Schwinger.\n\n2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:01.900\n It makes me somewhat sick.\n\n2:13:01.900 --> 2:13:07.020\n All of these people are such important giants and it has to do with the field I think not\n\n2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:12.740\n wanting to create luminaries and superstars who could have defended the field from budget\n\n2:13:12.740 --> 2:13:14.980\n cuts and worldly pressures.\n\n2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:20.820\n So I think it's really important that we have absolute superstars because we produce superstars.\n\n2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:26.180\n We acknowledge them, we don't dilute them and that we bend the rules to make sure that\n\n2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:33.100\n the prize stays funded with the prestige that comes from giving it to the Roger Penrose's,\n\n2:13:33.100 --> 2:13:36.740\n Albert Einstein's and Paul Dirac's of the world.\n\n2:13:36.740 --> 2:13:39.820\n Can we talk a little bit about evil?\n\n2:13:39.820 --> 2:13:41.020\n Sure.\n\n2:13:41.020 --> 2:13:49.540\n I haven't actually talked to you about this topic and it's been sitting on my mind mostly\n\n2:13:49.540 --> 2:13:56.700\n because everybody at MIT is quiet about it, which is Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n2:13:56.700 --> 2:14:02.380\n I didn't get a chance to experience what MIT was like at the time when Jeffrey Epstein\n\n2:14:02.380 --> 2:14:15.320\n was part of this, but I'd love to try to understand how evil was allowed to flourish in a place\n\n2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:18.860\n that I love.\n\n2:14:18.860 --> 2:14:24.380\n Whether you think, maybe let me ask the question this way.\n\n2:14:24.380 --> 2:14:35.420\n Was it the man evil or was the system evil or is evil too strong a word?\n\n2:14:35.420 --> 2:14:44.920\n Because what I see is the presence of this particular human being in the eyes of many\n\n2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:55.380\n destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weakened the ability,\n\n2:14:55.380 --> 2:15:04.060\n like weakened the institution of MIT by making everybody quiet, like almost making them unable\n\n2:15:04.060 --> 2:15:09.620\n to say anything interesting or difficult.\n\n2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:14.380\n And what is that and what am I supposed to?\n\n2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:15.380\n We don't know.\n\n2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:18.140\n Why is everyone quiet about Jeff?\n\n2:15:18.140 --> 2:15:19.140\n We don't know.\n\n2:15:19.140 --> 2:15:22.500\n Obviously I want to scream about it too, right?\n\n2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:26.460\n And I probably have said too much about Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:29.500\n Look, something horrible happened.\n\n2:15:29.500 --> 2:15:34.740\n I don't know what it is, but something horrible happened.\n\n2:15:34.740 --> 2:15:40.100\n And you know, at the one thing that, okay, let's just do this.\n\n2:15:40.100 --> 2:15:47.420\n The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid of this woke crap about power differentials.\n\n2:15:47.420 --> 2:15:54.980\n In general, you can talk about hypergamy and power differentials are Russell conjugates\n\n2:15:54.980 --> 2:16:01.300\n of the same concept, just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically\n\n2:16:01.300 --> 2:16:08.000\n provable to be attractive in females to males.\n\n2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.220\n Male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to amass power\n\n2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:18.220\n and success and all these sorts of things.\n\n2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:25.300\n The relationship between consenting adults is quite frankly not something I want to sort\n\n2:16:25.300 --> 2:16:33.880\n out the relationship between the sexuality of adults and minors.\n\n2:16:33.880 --> 2:16:46.660\n And particularly, you know, there's the 17, 18 issue that's very different than 12, 13.\n\n2:16:46.660 --> 2:16:52.620\n We're talking about really sick depravity with respect to what it appears that Jeffrey\n\n2:16:52.620 --> 2:16:56.220\n Epstein was involved in at some level.\n\n2:16:56.220 --> 2:17:01.260\n I believe this story is super complicated in part because I think one thing Jeffrey\n\n2:17:01.260 --> 2:17:09.900\n Epstein was doing was providing money, encouragement, and support to scientists.\n\n2:17:09.900 --> 2:17:15.820\n Another thing he was doing, I believe, was giving tax advice to very rich people.\n\n2:17:15.820 --> 2:17:26.320\n I believe another thing he was doing was hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females.\n\n2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:36.300\n Another thing he was doing, I think, was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.\n\n2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:39.780\n So there's an entire spectrum of different stuff.\n\n2:17:39.780 --> 2:17:46.100\n And at the moment, nobody can pull apart or deconflate anything because the woke thing\n\n2:17:46.100 --> 2:17:54.020\n comes over it and says, I think it's disgusting that a 43 year old billionaire would be partying\n\n2:17:54.020 --> 2:17:58.540\n with a 23 year old.\n\n2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:00.100\n I don't want to adjudicate that.\n\n2:18:00.100 --> 2:18:05.020\n I'm worried about 12 and 14 year olds that we're not talking about.\n\n2:18:05.020 --> 2:18:08.460\n I don't think MIT was deep into pedophilia.\n\n2:18:08.460 --> 2:18:10.460\n My guess is that that did not happen.\n\n2:18:10.460 --> 2:18:18.260\n I don't think that the scientists were the targets of the really sick depraved stuff.\n\n2:18:18.260 --> 2:18:19.900\n It's my guess.\n\n2:18:19.900 --> 2:18:24.940\n My guess is that what you're looking at was a government construct.\n\n2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:28.500\n It may have been our government, it may have been a joint government project, maybe somebody\n\n2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:29.500\n else's government.\n\n2:18:29.500 --> 2:18:31.300\n I don't know.\n\n2:18:31.300 --> 2:18:37.140\n I believe that in part, we don't really understand Robert Maxwell.\n\n2:18:37.140 --> 2:18:39.580\n Sorry, who's Robert Maxwell?\n\n2:18:39.580 --> 2:18:44.700\n Ghislaine Maxwell's father was very active in scientific publishing.\n\n2:18:44.700 --> 2:18:46.500\n I don't know where peer review came from.\n\n2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:50.300\n I would love to run down the relationship between peer review and Robert Maxwell.\n\n2:18:50.300 --> 2:18:56.100\n I would love to run down the missing fortune of Robert Maxwell and the mysterious fortune\n\n2:18:56.100 --> 2:19:00.700\n of Jeffrey Epstein because I don't think Jeffrey Epstein ever ran a hedge fund.\n\n2:19:00.700 --> 2:19:04.900\n I don't think he was a money advisor the way people claimed.\n\n2:19:04.900 --> 2:19:06.540\n There's two things I want to talk about.\n\n2:19:06.540 --> 2:19:14.060\n One is the shallow conversations of woke identity politics that you're referring to seems to\n\n2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:22.140\n be removing everyone's ability, no, everyone's willingness to talk about like, what the hell\n\n2:19:22.140 --> 2:19:25.260\n is this person and how is he allowed?\n\n2:19:25.260 --> 2:19:30.180\n Most importantly, how do we prevent it in the future?\n\n2:19:30.180 --> 2:19:36.060\n From the individual perspective, the question for me is the same question I ask about 1930s\n\n2:19:36.060 --> 2:19:37.060\n Nazi Germany.\n\n2:19:37.060 --> 2:19:41.700\n I've been reading way too much probably or not enough about that period currently.\n\n2:19:41.700 --> 2:19:47.260\n If I was in Germany at that time, what is the heroic action to take?\n\n2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:51.620\n When I think about MIT with Jeffrey Epstein, what is the heroic action to take?\n\n2:19:51.620 --> 2:19:53.420\n We're not talking about virtue signaling action.\n\n2:19:53.420 --> 2:19:54.600\n You wouldn't know what to do.\n\n2:19:54.600 --> 2:19:57.060\n I would not know what you're up against, Lex.\n\n2:19:57.060 --> 2:19:58.840\n You're not hearing me.\n\n2:19:58.840 --> 2:20:02.140\n The problem here is what was Jeffrey Epstein?\n\n2:20:02.140 --> 2:20:05.940\n Well, that question might be the heroic action to take.\n\n2:20:05.940 --> 2:20:06.940\n That's all I'm trying to say.\n\n2:20:06.940 --> 2:20:08.340\n I'm just trying to get my first question.\n\n2:20:08.340 --> 2:20:10.980\n You have to map the silence with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n2:20:10.980 --> 2:20:16.020\n What you're describing is a map of the silence at MIT.\n\n2:20:16.020 --> 2:20:24.140\n Well, is there a map of the silence in Washington state around Jeffrey Epstein, the Bay Area,\n\n2:20:24.140 --> 2:20:26.180\n New York City?\n\n2:20:26.180 --> 2:20:31.600\n The amount of silence around Jeffrey Epstein should be telling you everything.\n\n2:20:31.600 --> 2:20:36.500\n The number of dogs that don't bark is like nothing we've ever seen.\n\n2:20:36.500 --> 2:20:40.340\n You're exactly correct, but I want to know what is it telling us?\n\n2:20:40.340 --> 2:20:49.620\n Because what it's telling me is not some kind of conspiracy, but more a disappointing weakness.\n\n2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:50.620\n Not some kind of conspiracy?\n\n2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:52.900\n It's not some kind of conspiracy, but...\n\n2:20:52.900 --> 2:20:55.060\n You've got to be kidding.\n\n2:20:55.060 --> 2:20:58.820\n You're so afraid of saying the word conspiracy that you don't think it's a conspiracy?\n\n2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:04.660\n I personally, I just think it's people who I thought were my heroes just being weak.\n\n2:21:04.660 --> 2:21:06.020\n No.\n\n2:21:06.020 --> 2:21:08.180\n Be of good cheer, sir.\n\n2:21:08.180 --> 2:21:09.180\n A cheer?\n\n2:21:09.180 --> 2:21:10.180\n Be of good cheer.\n\n2:21:10.180 --> 2:21:11.180\n Be of good cheer.\n\n2:21:11.180 --> 2:21:12.180\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:12.180 --> 2:21:13.180\n You think that there's a conspiracy?\n\n2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:15.180\n I think there is a conspiracy.\n\n2:21:15.180 --> 2:21:18.460\n That'd be a very impressive one.\n\n2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:20.180\n That's the scale of it.\n\n2:21:20.180 --> 2:21:25.580\n I tend to believe that large scale can only be an emergent phenomena.\n\n2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:26.580\n Really?\n\n2:21:26.580 --> 2:21:27.580\n I find this so fascinating.\n\n2:21:27.580 --> 2:21:28.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:28.580 --> 2:21:35.140\n Because I always see you as like a logic and love drive your soul.\n\n2:21:35.140 --> 2:21:36.140\n You're very logical.\n\n2:21:36.140 --> 2:21:37.140\n You're relentless.\n\n2:21:37.140 --> 2:21:38.660\n You've got a lot of love in your heart.\n\n2:21:38.660 --> 2:21:41.780\n I believe that if you would review the video, where is it from?\n\n2:21:41.780 --> 2:21:47.180\n Dubai or Abu Dhabi of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest?\n\n2:21:47.180 --> 2:21:48.180\n You ever seen this thing?\n\n2:21:48.180 --> 2:21:49.180\n No.\n\n2:21:49.180 --> 2:21:50.180\n What happened?\n\n2:21:50.180 --> 2:21:57.460\n It's the assassination in 2010, 10 years ago, of Mahmoud Al Mabou, something like that,\n\n2:21:57.460 --> 2:22:07.580\n in Dubai where I believe 26 separate individuals on multiple teams are shown converging coming\n\n2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:15.440\n in from all over the world on false passports, pretending to be tennis players or business\n\n2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:19.740\n people or vacationers.\n\n2:22:19.740 --> 2:22:27.940\n All of these teams have different functions and they murder this guy in his hotel room.\n\n2:22:27.940 --> 2:22:35.180\n The Dubai, I guess, chief of police or security officer was so angered that he put together\n\n2:22:35.180 --> 2:22:39.740\n this amazing video that says, we can completely detail what you did.\n\n2:22:39.740 --> 2:22:42.640\n We caught you on closed circuit TV.\n\n2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:46.860\n We don't know exactly who you are because your disguises and your false passports, but\n\n2:22:46.860 --> 2:22:51.100\n yeah, 26 people converged to kill one.\n\n2:22:51.100 --> 2:22:53.520\n No, I don't believe you.\n\n2:22:53.520 --> 2:23:02.820\n I don't believe after COINTELPRO and Operation Paperclip and Operation Mockingbird.\n\n2:23:02.820 --> 2:23:07.620\n I don't know whether I should even bring up Rex 84.\n\n2:23:07.620 --> 2:23:11.660\n To not believe in conspiracies is an idiocy.\n\n2:23:11.660 --> 2:23:18.220\n So you have a sense that evil can be as competent or more competent.\n\n2:23:18.220 --> 2:23:22.660\n First of all, when evil wants to operate at scale, it needs to make sure that people don't\n\n2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:25.140\n try to figure out evil.\n\n2:23:25.140 --> 2:23:32.380\n When evil operates at scale, from first principles, you have to realize that evil must not want\n\n2:23:32.380 --> 2:23:35.140\n it investigated.\n\n2:23:35.140 --> 2:23:42.200\n The most efficient way to keep yourself from being investigated, if you are an evil institutional\n\n2:23:42.200 --> 2:23:47.700\n player who needs to do this repeatedly, is to invest in a world in which no one can afford\n\n2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:49.940\n to say the word conspiracy.\n\n2:23:49.940 --> 2:23:54.500\n You'll notice that there is a special radioactivity around the word conspiracy.\n\n2:23:54.500 --> 2:23:56.140\n We have provable conspiracies.\n\n2:23:56.140 --> 2:23:57.820\n We have admitted to conspiracies.\n\n2:23:57.820 --> 2:24:00.020\n You have been invited to conspiracy.\n\n2:24:00.020 --> 2:24:01.260\n There is no shortage.\n\n2:24:01.260 --> 2:24:02.860\n Conspiracies are everywhere.\n\n2:24:02.860 --> 2:24:04.220\n Some of them are mundane.\n\n2:24:04.220 --> 2:24:11.740\n Some of them are like price fixing cartels, or trade groups, or generally speaking, conspiracies.\n\n2:24:11.740 --> 2:24:19.540\n So the first thing you have to realize is that all of us are in a memetic complex where\n\n2:24:19.540 --> 2:24:23.940\n you can be taken off the chessboard by saying, conspiracy theorists, get done.\n\n2:24:23.940 --> 2:24:25.000\n It's like a one line proof.\n\n2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:26.220\n We don't have to listen to Lex.\n\n2:24:26.220 --> 2:24:30.500\n He said he was a conspiracy theorist on this show.\n\n2:24:30.500 --> 2:24:32.600\n That is partially distorting our conversation.\n\n2:24:32.600 --> 2:24:37.060\n If you want to ask me about Jeffrey Epstein, you have to agree with me that that is a logical\n\n2:24:37.060 --> 2:24:41.220\n description of what you would have to have if you wanted to commit conspiracies is that\n\n2:24:41.220 --> 2:24:46.380\n you have to make sure that people are dissuaded from investigating this.\n\n2:24:46.380 --> 2:24:53.300\n But it's a fascinatingly difficult idea then because the world with conspiracy theories\n\n2:24:53.300 --> 2:24:58.900\n and the world without conspiracy theories to the shallow glance looks the same.\n\n2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:00.160\n Well, my point.\n\n2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:08.460\n There is responsible conspiracy theorize where you look at the history of unearthed conspiracies\n\n2:25:08.460 --> 2:25:12.460\n and just like you would with any other topic, just think about how different the rules in\n\n2:25:12.460 --> 2:25:20.100\n your mind are for conspiracy theorizing versus X theorizing where X can be anything, right?\n\n2:25:20.100 --> 2:25:28.420\n It's like if I say to you, um, I can say the statement that average weight is not the same\n\n2:25:28.420 --> 2:25:31.940\n between widely separated populations.\n\n2:25:31.940 --> 2:25:37.660\n You'd say, yeah, I'd say average height is not the same between widely separated populations.\n\n2:25:37.660 --> 2:25:38.660\n You'd say, yeah.\n\n2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:44.700\n Then I say, in fact, no continuous variable that has that shows variation should be expected\n\n2:25:44.700 --> 2:25:46.780\n to be identical between widely separate.\n\n2:25:46.780 --> 2:25:52.300\n Of course they're like IQ, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, right?\n\n2:25:52.300 --> 2:25:56.800\n So we have a violent reaction to specific topics.\n\n2:25:56.800 --> 2:26:02.940\n So the first thing I want to do is just to notice that conspiracy has that built into\n\n2:26:02.940 --> 2:26:05.240\n everyone's mind.\n\n2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:06.620\n That's really important to state.\n\n2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:13.100\n Yeah, that's, it's very interesting that, and as a prerequisite, as you're saying, that\n\n2:26:13.100 --> 2:26:14.100\n would be the first step.\n\n2:26:14.100 --> 2:26:20.620\n If you wanted to pull off a conspiracy in a competent way, that's, you would have to\n\n2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:21.620\n first convince the world.\n\n2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:27.500\n I just watched the film 1971 about my favorite conspiracy of all time, I highly recommend\n\n2:26:27.500 --> 2:26:34.680\n it 1971 well, the film is entitled 1971 and it's about the citizens committee to investigate\n\n2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:43.000\n the FBI, which was a run by a student of Murray Gelman, a physicist and broke into FBI offices\n\n2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:48.800\n in Pennsylvania to steal files, which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered\n\n2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:49.800\n a huge conspiracy.\n\n2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:55.700\n It was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government, a double conspiracy\n\n2:26:55.700 --> 2:27:00.620\n story, which launched multiple conspiracies.\n\n2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:05.620\n I think that the problem with modern Americans is that they are so timid that they don't\n\n2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:10.860\n even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely proven.\n\n2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:19.360\n So with that done, Jeff Epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody's construction.\n\n2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:21.500\n I don't think that scary to think about.\n\n2:27:21.500 --> 2:27:22.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:22.500 --> 2:27:24.940\n Well, what part of the story isn't scary?\n\n2:27:24.940 --> 2:27:31.020\n I in part did something which I imagine may get me destroyed because I was more worried\n\n2:27:31.020 --> 2:27:37.700\n about being destroyed by somebody else I had a conversation with around Jeff Epstein, right?\n\n2:27:37.700 --> 2:27:41.580\n So I'm just trying to like get, let it be known that I don't know anything more than\n\n2:27:41.580 --> 2:27:43.300\n I've already said.\n\n2:27:43.300 --> 2:27:51.600\n Now, your friends at MIT, their problem is that Jeff Epstein showed up as the only person\n\n2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:58.100\n capable of continuing US scientific tradition.\n\n2:27:58.100 --> 2:28:04.260\n You see, the US scientific tradition is a little bit like the Russian.\n\n2:28:04.260 --> 2:28:09.200\n It's combative, okay?\n\n2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:12.460\n And we're a free society and we act like a free society.\n\n2:28:12.460 --> 2:28:15.780\n We're a rich society and we research like we're a rich society.\n\n2:28:15.780 --> 2:28:21.180\n That is historically, and then came the 1970s and William Proxmire and the Golden Fleece\n\n2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:25.540\n Awards and the idea that we have to, we're paying too much and these are welfare queens\n\n2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:28.060\n and lab coats and blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:28:28.060 --> 2:28:31.460\n We need more transparency, more oversight.\n\n2:28:31.460 --> 2:28:37.480\n Everything went to hell and the national culture of US science was lost.\n\n2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:43.420\n The thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost.\n\n2:28:43.420 --> 2:28:52.860\n And then Jeff Epstein shows up and a tiny number of funders, maybe Fred Kavli, maybe\n\n2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:59.660\n Yuri Milner, maybe who else would be in this category?\n\n2:28:59.660 --> 2:29:05.480\n Peter Thiel to an extent, Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things, which has\n\n2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:12.300\n different grant structures than the NIH, gave people a modicum of risk taking ability.\n\n2:29:12.300 --> 2:29:20.060\n Okay, well, when Jeff Epstein showed up, everybody wanted to take risk in science.\n\n2:29:20.060 --> 2:29:24.300\n And suddenly a charismatic billionaire says, hey, I can make that work for you.\n\n2:29:24.300 --> 2:29:27.860\n Here's $100,000, go research something crazy.\n\n2:29:27.860 --> 2:29:34.640\n Well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal government under the terms\n\n2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:39.100\n of the endless frontier compact between the federal government and the universities and\n\n2:29:39.100 --> 2:29:42.100\n the federal government and the taxpayers Welch.\n\n2:29:42.100 --> 2:29:43.780\n Okay.\n\n2:29:43.780 --> 2:29:50.540\n So that's one place to lay the blame for Jeff Epstein as at the failure of the federal government\n\n2:29:50.540 --> 2:29:53.020\n to honor its commitment.\n\n2:29:53.020 --> 2:29:54.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:54.020 --> 2:29:55.020\n Right.\n\n2:29:55.020 --> 2:29:57.960\n So the universities became psychopathic.\n\n2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:02.500\n It's not like everybody doesn't remember what we're supposed to be doing to be moral, but\n\n2:30:02.500 --> 2:30:04.980\n the point was there wasn't enough money to be moral.\n\n2:30:04.980 --> 2:30:11.480\n So it was time to, uh, to eye each other as a source of protein, as I like to say.\n\n2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:17.780\n And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said, Hey, come to my world.\n\n2:30:17.780 --> 2:30:22.000\n We can do it like we used to do.\n\n2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:28.900\n So in part, my point is, is that almost none of your colleagues at MIT have that kind of\n\n2:30:28.900 --> 2:30:35.760\n religious commitment to science that they're willing to go down with ship science.\n\n2:30:35.760 --> 2:30:41.060\n The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally you just have\n\n2:30:41.060 --> 2:30:48.340\n to say, look, this isn't about me and you, there isn't enough money in the world to buy\n\n2:30:48.340 --> 2:30:53.340\n the kind of legacy I want to leave to this planet.\n\n2:30:53.340 --> 2:30:56.660\n This is one of the great things about science, you know, potentially it's worth dying for\n\n2:30:56.660 --> 2:31:00.500\n yeah.\n\n2:31:00.500 --> 2:31:03.380\n I'm glad you said it.\n\n2:31:03.380 --> 2:31:08.140\n Science is one of the things that is best that's worth dying for.\n\n2:31:08.140 --> 2:31:17.300\n I mean, I'm not eager to martyr myself, but I've certainly risked my health, my fortune,\n\n2:31:17.300 --> 2:31:26.860\n you know, I've, I've destroyed myself economically over science and, um, and my, my, my, my need\n\n2:31:26.860 --> 2:31:30.760\n to oppose these sons of bitches in chaired professorships who are destroying our system\n\n2:31:30.760 --> 2:31:32.940\n along with everyone else.\n\n2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:38.980\n Let me, um, bring in grandmaster into this.\n\n2:31:38.980 --> 2:31:41.620\n Oogway, master Oogway.\n\n2:31:41.620 --> 2:31:45.100\n I think he's a grandmaster.\n\n2:31:45.100 --> 2:31:46.940\n That would make him a chess playing turtle.\n\n2:31:46.940 --> 2:31:52.460\n Well, I've read some wikipedia and she was a master.\n\n2:31:52.460 --> 2:31:58.300\n There's apparently only one grandmaster and that's anyway, is the phrase grandmaster ever\n\n2:31:58.300 --> 2:31:59.300\n uttered in the script?\n\n2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:00.300\n I don't think so.\n\n2:32:00.300 --> 2:32:01.300\n I don't think so.\n\n2:32:01.300 --> 2:32:02.300\n But there's a story.\n\n2:32:02.300 --> 2:32:05.420\n Oh, there's, there's off off script cannon.\n\n2:32:05.420 --> 2:32:08.820\n I'm going to call Glenn burger right now and find out if any of this is true.\n\n2:32:08.820 --> 2:32:09.820\n All right.\n\n2:32:09.820 --> 2:32:16.220\n You're not supposed to call up my journalistic integrity, um, but master Oogway, master Oogway\n\n2:32:16.220 --> 2:32:20.780\n he says a couple of things I'd like to bring up with you.\n\n2:32:20.780 --> 2:32:27.740\n So one as part of a longer quote recommends, uh, that you should, uh, find a battle worth\n\n2:32:27.740 --> 2:32:31.900\n fighting.\n\n2:32:31.900 --> 2:32:35.820\n We've talked about several battles just now.\n\n2:32:35.820 --> 2:32:42.300\n What is the battle worth fighting for, for Eric Weinstein in the next few months, in\n\n2:32:42.300 --> 2:32:43.700\n the next year?\n\n2:32:43.700 --> 2:32:52.940\n There's only one, well, it's, it's the Moses, it's the Moses thing.\n\n2:32:52.940 --> 2:32:53.940\n It's time to go.\n\n2:32:53.940 --> 2:32:54.940\n It's time to leave.\n\n2:32:54.940 --> 2:32:57.100\n This place is over to get off the planet.\n\n2:32:57.100 --> 2:33:03.600\n I, yeah, I, I, I freak people out when I say that, but like, look at your world.\n\n2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:06.460\n You just got introduced to the problem of a virus.\n\n2:33:06.460 --> 2:33:11.420\n Wait, wait till it's fusion devices and you understand what it means to have one interconnected\n\n2:33:11.420 --> 2:33:17.100\n planet with no uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else.\n\n2:33:17.100 --> 2:33:18.100\n You know?\n\n2:33:18.100 --> 2:33:26.260\n So do you see the foray, your work in physics and maybe like the echoes of it in a ship\n\n2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:28.540\n Elon?\n\n2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:34.880\n Everybody who has a possible plan to avoid what is coming if we don't have one should\n\n2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:41.700\n work on the plan that he, she thinks best, right?\n\n2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:43.880\n So Elon wants to do rockets.\n\n2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:45.020\n People misinterpret me.\n\n2:33:45.020 --> 2:33:51.740\n I meta Eric says, I don't think that's a smart plan.\n\n2:33:51.740 --> 2:33:59.260\n Regular Eric says all people who have hope should do that thing.\n\n2:33:59.260 --> 2:34:00.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:00.260 --> 2:34:05.020\n At least it's Mars, man, at least it's the moon and Mars and maybe Titan and whatever.\n\n2:34:05.020 --> 2:34:08.220\n And I don't think it'll work and it doesn't make sense and it looks silly, but that's\n\n2:34:08.220 --> 2:34:09.980\n exactly the kind of fight worth fighting.\n\n2:34:09.980 --> 2:34:14.420\n But it's, it's the kind of fits for the same reason that I went on Brett's unity, 2020\n\n2:34:14.420 --> 2:34:17.200\n thing when I didn't think it had a hope in hell and people are, you know, are making\n\n2:34:17.200 --> 2:34:18.200\n fun of it.\n\n2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:22.640\n It's like, we got to do things that make, that make us feel dumb and silly and childish\n\n2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:24.780\n that it possibly have a hope of working.\n\n2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:25.780\n Okay.\n\n2:34:25.780 --> 2:34:27.260\n So everybody should do something.\n\n2:34:27.260 --> 2:34:31.500\n My version of this, I am the most hopeful about because I wouldn't have chosen to do\n\n2:34:31.500 --> 2:34:37.000\n if I thought that Daniel Schmack did burgers wisdom project was a better hope.\n\n2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:39.000\n I do that.\n\n2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.740\n It's more down to earth in a certain way.\n\n2:34:41.740 --> 2:34:43.900\n I just think that it's more probable.\n\n2:34:43.900 --> 2:34:49.540\n Look, we got from a powered flight with the Wright brothers and wind tunnels to sending\n\n2:34:49.540 --> 2:34:55.580\n back images from the surface of Titan via Huygens Cassini in less than a century.\n\n2:34:55.580 --> 2:34:56.580\n Okay.\n\n2:34:56.580 --> 2:35:02.660\n So what we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive\n\n2:35:02.660 --> 2:35:03.660\n of.\n\n2:35:03.660 --> 2:35:11.900\n It may be that it buys us nothing and at least we'll, we will know why we died on this planet\n\n2:35:11.900 --> 2:35:13.140\n as a small aside.\n\n2:35:13.140 --> 2:35:19.700\n I think this is not the right time to take the full journey, but I feel like you'll guide\n\n2:35:19.700 --> 2:35:22.620\n me like master way did.\n\n2:35:22.620 --> 2:35:24.300\n And I'm the Kung Fu Panda.\n\n2:35:24.300 --> 2:35:27.820\n They only have one conversation.\n\n2:35:27.820 --> 2:35:33.120\n We're on our, like, we didn't, we didn't, well, we're, we're, we're Jews and they weren't.\n\n2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:37.900\n So we talked too much, but the guide doesn't have to be with words.\n\n2:35:37.900 --> 2:35:40.700\n You don't think Poe was Jewish?\n\n2:35:40.700 --> 2:35:41.700\n It's debatable.\n\n2:35:41.700 --> 2:35:46.820\n We'll have to go back to the Wikipedia.\n\n2:35:46.820 --> 2:35:55.600\n Is there, um, that you would guide me through some more intuition about the source code,\n\n2:35:55.600 --> 2:35:58.060\n the source code of our universe.\n\n2:35:58.060 --> 2:36:03.500\n Can you comment on where, since we last spoke, where your thinking has been, has roamed around\n\n2:36:03.500 --> 2:36:08.300\n geometric unity around that work in physics in this fight?\n\n2:36:08.300 --> 2:36:15.460\n I'm trying to figure out when to release it and how, I mean, I've released the video and\n\n2:36:15.460 --> 2:36:19.860\n the video, quite honestly, I think it has a very bizarre reaction.\n\n2:36:19.860 --> 2:36:23.180\n I think one of the things that I've learned from the video, cause the video is coming\n\n2:36:23.180 --> 2:36:31.060\n up on half a million views on YouTube alone to say nothing of the, um, the audio, but\n\n2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:34.740\n yeah, it produced a very strange reaction.\n\n2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:41.460\n One of the things I don't think that I properly understood is that most physicists don't talk\n\n2:36:41.460 --> 2:36:46.700\n in this geometric language.\n\n2:36:46.700 --> 2:36:52.900\n I thought that more of the physics world probably had converted over into manifolds, bundles,\n\n2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:57.180\n differential forms, connections, curvature, tensors, et cetera.\n\n2:36:57.180 --> 2:37:02.260\n And I, I saw a lot of the comments would say things like, I have a PhD in theoretical physics\n\n2:37:02.260 --> 2:37:05.220\n and I'm not even familiar with all of these concepts.\n\n2:37:05.220 --> 2:37:11.980\n And I think that was probably a distortion coming from living in Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\n2:37:11.980 --> 2:37:14.860\n for almost 20 years.\n\n2:37:14.860 --> 2:37:16.340\n So what's the solution to that?\n\n2:37:16.340 --> 2:37:21.300\n Well, I mean, I can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to.\n\n2:37:21.300 --> 2:37:31.300\n My problem is my calculation is that as long as the boomers are still in charge, the same\n\n2:37:31.300 --> 2:37:35.980\n people have these perverse incentives on them where they've invested in these programs that\n\n2:37:35.980 --> 2:37:36.980\n didn't work.\n\n2:37:36.980 --> 2:37:41.860\n So they're extremely hostile and kind of difficult to deal with.\n\n2:37:41.860 --> 2:37:47.300\n The fact that I'm not a physicist, um, has its own set of issues, which is that effectively\n\n2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:48.520\n it's like the hermit kingdom.\n\n2:37:48.520 --> 2:37:55.180\n They don't get any visitors and they don't necessarily want somebody, you know, rolling\n\n2:37:55.180 --> 2:37:56.980\n up and saying, I know how to do physics.\n\n2:37:56.980 --> 2:37:58.300\n So I'm, I'm always very clear.\n\n2:37:58.300 --> 2:38:01.820\n I'm not a physicist.\n\n2:38:01.820 --> 2:38:06.180\n That said, if I wait too long, I don't know that theoretical physics is really going to\n\n2:38:06.180 --> 2:38:12.220\n exist after the boomers because everyone in you, I think you had Wolfram on your program.\n\n2:38:12.220 --> 2:38:16.020\n I don't remember whether he said this to you or Brian Keating, but he said something like\n\n2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:17.260\n everybody got discouraged.\n\n2:38:17.260 --> 2:38:20.820\n It was too hard.\n\n2:38:20.820 --> 2:38:21.820\n Can't do that.\n\n2:38:21.820 --> 2:38:22.820\n Guys.\n\n2:38:22.820 --> 2:38:23.820\n We cannot do that.\n\n2:38:23.820 --> 2:38:27.500\n There's something about the renormalization revolution that innervated the physics community\n\n2:38:27.500 --> 2:38:31.740\n because it taught them just because you can see in this energy regime doesn't mean you\n\n2:38:31.740 --> 2:38:36.300\n can extrapolate somewhere else unless you understand how, you know, coupling constants\n\n2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:41.740\n run and what kind of a UV fixed points exist, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:38:41.740 --> 2:38:46.020\n Somehow that discouraged people from guessing from believing everything became an effective\n\n2:38:46.020 --> 2:38:47.020\n theory.\n\n2:38:47.020 --> 2:38:51.740\n The beauty of the effective theory wasn't taken to be really the beauty of the universe,\n\n2:38:51.740 --> 2:38:53.420\n just the beauty of an energy level.\n\n2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:58.940\n So I think that renormalization was one of the most important revolutions that ever happened\n\n2:38:58.940 --> 2:38:59.940\n in science.\n\n2:38:59.940 --> 2:39:04.300\n And also its interpretation by the physics community was catastrophic.\n\n2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:10.200\n Well, the story I'm telling myself is that in part I'm waiting for them to get weaker.\n\n2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:12.380\n But on the other hand, I don't know that we have any time left.\n\n2:39:12.380 --> 2:39:19.800\n And so are you also thinking about ways of, uh, you know, you know, the, the podcast medium\n\n2:39:19.800 --> 2:39:24.820\n is revolutionary for public for discourse for what, I mean, I don't even know the right\n\n2:39:24.820 --> 2:39:25.820\n words for it.\n\n2:39:25.820 --> 2:39:30.700\n Are you thinking of revolutionary ideas for re energizing the physics community?\n\n2:39:30.700 --> 2:39:36.980\n So basically for communicating, look, I have a fantasy, okay?\n\n2:39:36.980 --> 2:39:40.040\n My fantasy is that all of these things are the same problem.\n\n2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:46.960\n And it goes back to this thing that I read about in, in Fineman's, um, books about Tartaglia.\n\n2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.060\n They asked him this question, like, what's the greatest thing that ever happened in math?\n\n2:39:50.060 --> 2:39:52.900\n And he says, Tartaglia is solution of the cubic.\n\n2:39:52.900 --> 2:39:55.860\n It's just like the weirdest answer.\n\n2:39:55.860 --> 2:39:58.100\n So you're like, okay, I'll bite.\n\n2:39:58.100 --> 2:40:00.380\n Why is it Tartaglia solution of the cubic?\n\n2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:04.260\n And he said, because it was the first time a modern person had done something profound\n\n2:40:04.260 --> 2:40:06.300\n that the ancients had failed to do.\n\n2:40:06.300 --> 2:40:09.460\n I was like, Oh, I got it.\n\n2:40:09.460 --> 2:40:14.460\n It's the thing that opens up new psychology that says maybe things are possible again.\n\n2:40:14.460 --> 2:40:22.500\n It's a new orchard, new orchard, new farmers, new people who can find fruit that they can\n\n2:40:22.500 --> 2:40:23.820\n pick.\n\n2:40:23.820 --> 2:40:27.460\n And once you have one person do that, very often you get many, like one of the things\n\n2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:29.660\n that we were talking about with Eddie Van Halen.\n\n2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:35.260\n The reason that he created a revolution and somebody like Roy Buchanan did not is that\n\n2:40:35.260 --> 2:40:36.960\n you could follow Eddie Van Halen.\n\n2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:38.220\n You couldn't pioneer it.\n\n2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:42.340\n And maybe you couldn't play as well and as cleanly and as fast and as inventively, but\n\n2:40:42.340 --> 2:40:47.180\n you could follow once you understand that there is a tapping principle.\n\n2:40:47.180 --> 2:40:53.340\n It was just the beginning of something called percussive guitar.\n\n2:40:53.340 --> 2:41:00.300\n My belief is that once we start innovating in the present, everything will come because\n\n2:41:00.300 --> 2:41:04.820\n everything that around us is screwed up on that.\n\n2:41:04.820 --> 2:41:10.580\n Let me with one last question, bring back master Oogway, the probably the most famous\n\n2:41:10.580 --> 2:41:17.660\n quote of his, right, with yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, but today is a gift.\n\n2:41:17.660 --> 2:41:20.660\n That is why it is called the present.\n\n2:41:20.660 --> 2:41:21.660\n It's very beautiful.\n\n2:41:21.660 --> 2:41:27.420\n Although I would have gone with quit, don't quit, noodles, don't noodles.\n\n2:41:27.420 --> 2:41:33.420\n I feel like people need to know way too much context for that to make sense.\n\n2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:34.420\n It's your audience.\n\n2:41:34.420 --> 2:41:35.740\n To hell with context.\n\n2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:36.740\n Yep.\n\n2:41:36.740 --> 2:41:37.740\n They'll figure it out.\n\n2:41:37.740 --> 2:41:41.820\n Let me ask, what are you grateful for today?\n\n2:41:41.820 --> 2:41:44.060\n What is your present?\n\n2:41:44.060 --> 2:41:52.020\n We've talked about a lot of dark things, but what brings you joy to your heart that I can't\n\n2:41:52.020 --> 2:41:55.420\n believe I'm lucky enough to have this?\n\n2:41:55.420 --> 2:42:04.420\n You know, Nyla and Zev, my wife, Pia, the fact that we've got our health, all the little\n\n2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:08.460\n things, saying grace after meals.\n\n2:42:08.460 --> 2:42:13.720\n You're coming over for Friday night Shabbat dinner, so we'll bench together and say grace.\n\n2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:23.940\n It's important to just, like this bottle of water in front of me, I made a point of just\n\n2:42:23.940 --> 2:42:27.500\n thinking about how wonderful it is that there's a quenching bottle that happens to be placed\n\n2:42:27.500 --> 2:42:30.060\n in front of me because somebody cared.\n\n2:42:30.060 --> 2:42:37.300\n That small thing made a difference to me.\n\n2:42:37.300 --> 2:42:40.820\n I still have strength for the fight so far.\n\n2:42:40.820 --> 2:42:43.060\n I think that's something I'm grateful for.\n\n2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:51.100\n I can't believe that I'm not more beaten down after all of this nonsense.\n\n2:42:51.100 --> 2:42:54.220\n I have the most interesting set of friends.\n\n2:42:54.220 --> 2:42:56.940\n I really do.\n\n2:42:56.940 --> 2:43:01.980\n I'm not that rich by monetary standards, but if there were friend billionaires, Forbes\n\n2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:07.300\n would be all over my ass.\n\n2:43:07.300 --> 2:43:12.540\n I just can't believe who I can talk to, you know, at the drop of a hat.\n\n2:43:12.540 --> 2:43:22.500\n And I'm really grateful.\n\n2:43:22.500 --> 2:43:28.880\n I think this is the end of something profound, and it's the beginning of whatever is next.\n\n2:43:28.880 --> 2:43:30.820\n And whatever is next could be terminal.\n\n2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:32.740\n Whatever is next could be amazing.\n\n2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:37.820\n Whatever is next could be a return to the horrors of the early 20th century that doesn't\n\n2:43:37.820 --> 2:43:45.260\n manage to go totally catastrophic, but takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process.\n\n2:43:45.260 --> 2:43:50.900\n I'm grateful to having half of my life in the rearview mirror.\n\n2:43:50.900 --> 2:43:54.820\n Maybe it took place in a bubble, and maybe it was unsustainable.\n\n2:43:54.820 --> 2:44:00.100\n But it was nice to be able to move around the world without a mask.\n\n2:44:00.100 --> 2:44:05.780\n It was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world, even if it was from a cot in\n\n2:44:05.780 --> 2:44:09.340\n a hostel in some country.\n\n2:44:09.340 --> 2:44:10.340\n To fall in love.\n\n2:44:10.340 --> 2:44:11.340\n Absolutely.\n\n2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:15.180\n It was a good life.\n\n2:44:15.180 --> 2:44:17.620\n Find the last Indian Jewish girl left.\n\n2:44:17.620 --> 2:44:19.580\n Who knew?\n\n2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:21.900\n You're a lucky guy.\n\n2:44:21.900 --> 2:44:23.100\n Well, let me just say\u2026\n\n2:44:23.100 --> 2:44:26.540\n Actually, there's something I wanted to just say before you get to that.\n\n2:44:26.540 --> 2:44:29.060\n I forgot to say something.\n\n2:44:29.060 --> 2:44:34.540\n Falling in love with an intellectual collaborator is a special thing that not everybody gets\n\n2:44:34.540 --> 2:44:36.340\n a chance to do.\n\n2:44:36.340 --> 2:44:44.020\n I think when I met Pia, I fell deeply in love with her, all her normal characteristics.\n\n2:44:44.020 --> 2:44:50.780\n Pia and I had an antagonistic relationship around geometry and economics.\n\n2:44:50.780 --> 2:44:55.820\n And then weirdly, just like in a buddy picture where in the first half of the film they hate\n\n2:44:55.820 --> 2:45:01.140\n each other, the two fields were fighting with each other, cats and dogs, and finally the\n\n2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:04.900\n sexual tension clearly was so thick you could cut it with a knife.\n\n2:45:04.900 --> 2:45:08.940\n And we came up with geometric marginalism, which is this other theory, not geometric\n\n2:45:08.940 --> 2:45:18.140\n unity, which allowed me to inhabit space with somebody who I already knew intimately and\n\n2:45:18.140 --> 2:45:23.700\n had fallen in love with, and to see the quality and beauty of their mind and to play and to\n\n2:45:23.700 --> 2:45:24.700\n dance.\n\n2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:29.660\n It's sort of the intellectual version of the tango, one of the most romantic periods\n\n2:45:29.660 --> 2:45:32.740\n of my life that doesn't fall into most people's experience.\n\n2:45:32.740 --> 2:45:38.140\n So that was a chance to see something totally unexpected, haven't really had it since\n\n2:45:38.140 --> 2:45:42.820\n because she doesn't want to revisit the material, but something I'm super grateful for that's\n\n2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:45.580\n very particular and unique.\n\n2:45:45.580 --> 2:45:53.700\n But to flip the tables on you, for hundreds of thousands, I think millions of people,\n\n2:45:53.700 --> 2:46:02.780\n I can speak, me and them are really grateful, one, that you exist, and two, sorry, for your\n\n2:46:02.780 --> 2:46:14.140\n podcast and I do hope your voice in some form continues to reverberate, I think, at least\n\n2:46:14.140 --> 2:46:19.900\n in the 2021s and beyond, even if it takes a brief pause.\n\n2:46:19.900 --> 2:46:21.660\n We're pausing at the moment.\n\n2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:26.260\n We've recorded some for future episodes and I'm recording for you.\n\n2:46:26.260 --> 2:46:28.260\n I really appreciate that.\n\n2:46:28.260 --> 2:46:34.620\n But earnestness trades at a discount at the moment because it's easy to make fun of it.\n\n2:46:34.620 --> 2:46:38.980\n One of the things I like best about you is that you and I are both fairly earnest.\n\n2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:43.580\n We may joke and jab, but honestly, there's a project here and a world to win, as they\n\n2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:45.100\n say.\n\n2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:52.940\n The thing that I want my and your listeners to know is that I'm not stepping away from\n\n2:46:52.940 --> 2:47:01.260\n the podcast because I don't appreciate that people really want more.\n\n2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:05.220\n This is hugely financially costly to me.\n\n2:47:05.220 --> 2:47:12.500\n I want to make sure you guys are getting the best that I can do, and destroying myself\n\n2:47:12.500 --> 2:47:16.060\n right in front of an election, I think Lex is incorrect.\n\n2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:20.380\n I think that the forces that are trying to make sure that there aren't any planes in\n\n2:47:20.380 --> 2:47:27.580\n the sky that aren't either colored red or colored blue is a big danger given how angry\n\n2:47:27.580 --> 2:47:29.140\n I am at the system.\n\n2:47:29.140 --> 2:47:32.260\n I don't want to be removed from the chess board because if nobody's going to talk about\n\n2:47:32.260 --> 2:47:33.900\n Jeff Epstein, there need to be people.\n\n2:47:33.900 --> 2:47:38.060\n If nobody's going to talk about various things that we've talked about on these programs,\n\n2:47:38.060 --> 2:47:39.900\n I want to make sure that I'm there.\n\n2:47:39.900 --> 2:47:42.420\n Do I think that this is potentially an existential election?\n\n2:47:42.420 --> 2:47:43.420\n Yes.\n\n2:47:43.420 --> 2:47:45.820\n Am I positive that I know that my way to bet is the right way out?\n\n2:47:45.820 --> 2:47:47.420\n No, I'm not.\n\n2:47:47.420 --> 2:47:48.420\n I don't know, people.\n\n2:47:48.420 --> 2:47:49.980\n I just don't know.\n\n2:47:49.980 --> 2:47:55.780\n Where we are right now seems so dumb and so catastrophic in terms of how it is chewing\n\n2:47:55.780 --> 2:48:03.020\n up smart people that I decided it's really not about cowardice because it's hard for\n\n2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:04.260\n me to restrain myself.\n\n2:48:04.260 --> 2:48:07.900\n I have so many reactions every day.\n\n2:48:07.900 --> 2:48:12.300\n This is really about trying to plan for all of our futures to make sure that I'm around.\n\n2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:16.280\n I had a huge concern that what happened to Brett's Articles of Unity was going to happen\n\n2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:17.280\n to Brett.\n\n2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:19.380\n It was going to happen to the YouTube channels.\n\n2:48:19.380 --> 2:48:22.840\n I want to make sure that we don't have all of our eggs in one basket.\n\n2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:27.020\n So if something goes wrong over there, that's the whole idea of the intellectual dark web,\n\n2:48:27.020 --> 2:48:31.020\n which is at some level a loose confederation.\n\n2:48:31.020 --> 2:48:35.220\n It can become a strong confederation if somebody wants to back it and make it work.\n\n2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:40.380\n It can dissolve so that there really isn't anything.\n\n2:48:40.380 --> 2:48:46.580\n The thing is to be hard to kill because ultimately, when the hit pieces come, they don't come\n\n2:48:46.580 --> 2:48:48.660\n for what it is that they're angry at you about.\n\n2:48:48.660 --> 2:48:51.740\n They come for where they can get you.\n\n2:48:51.740 --> 2:48:59.660\n It's very important that right in front of an election, the desire of the old system\n\n2:48:59.660 --> 2:49:06.180\n to defend itself through reputational destruction is one of the most pernicious aspects of the\n\n2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:07.360\n new America.\n\n2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:14.440\n We have to fight the ability to destroy reputations as a means of institutions keeping individuals\n\n2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:20.300\n with podcasts and the ability to reach millions through Substack out of their domain.\n\n2:49:20.300 --> 2:49:22.380\n I don't surrender this domain to them.\n\n2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:26.980\n They have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us, and I believe that they could remove\n\n2:49:26.980 --> 2:49:28.740\n you or me in an instant.\n\n2:49:28.740 --> 2:49:32.980\n By the end of today, if they wanted us off the chessboard, we would be off the chessboard.\n\n2:49:32.980 --> 2:49:34.960\n I know that's not your perspective.\n\n2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:41.440\n My goal is to stay here as long as possible to make sure that you have enough of a counterbalancing\n\n2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:48.620\n set of ideas and to let and help other podcasters start.\n\n2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:56.540\n My hope is that that works, but long heroism, short martyrdom is a good motto for anyone,\n\n2:49:56.540 --> 2:50:01.620\n and I try to remember the short martyrdom part of that.\n\n2:50:01.620 --> 2:50:03.180\n First of all, beautifully put.\n\n2:50:03.180 --> 2:50:08.100\n Second of all, a way to end the conversation and the disagreement, which is how you hook\n\n2:50:08.100 --> 2:50:11.260\n them for the next conversation to be continued.\n\n2:50:11.260 --> 2:50:12.260\n And Lex says \u2026\n\n2:50:12.260 --> 2:50:15.420\n Eric, it's a huge honor.\n\n2:50:15.420 --> 2:50:16.420\n Thank you once again.\n\n2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:19.060\n Lex, really appreciate it every time we get together.\n\n2:50:19.060 --> 2:50:20.620\n Thanks, buddy.\n\n2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:24.460\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Eric Weinstein, and thank you to our\n\n2:50:24.460 --> 2:50:25.460\n sponsors.\n\n2:50:25.460 --> 2:50:30.020\n Grammarly, a service I use in my writing to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure\n\n2:50:30.020 --> 2:50:31.020\n and readability.\n\n2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:37.380\n Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use to add healthy variety to my culinary life.\n\n2:50:37.380 --> 2:50:43.380\n SEMrush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.\n\n2:50:43.380 --> 2:50:46.420\n I don't like looking at numbers, but someone should.\n\n2:50:46.420 --> 2:50:48.600\n It helps you make good decisions.\n\n2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:54.500\n And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the\n\n2:50:54.500 --> 2:50:55.980\n internet.\n\n2:50:55.980 --> 2:51:00.860\n Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n2:51:00.860 --> 2:51:06.140\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with 5 Stars and Apple Podcast,\n\n2:51:06.140 --> 2:51:12.220\n go on Spotify, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at lexfreedman.\n\n2:51:12.220 --> 2:51:18.540\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Leonard Cohen in the song titled, Hallelujah.\n\n2:51:18.540 --> 2:51:24.780\n Well, maybe there's a God above, but all I've ever learned from love was how to shoot\n\n2:51:24.780 --> 2:51:27.140\n somebody who outdrew you.\n\n2:51:27.140 --> 2:51:32.580\n And it's not a cry that you hear at night, it's not somebody who's seen the light,\n\n2:51:32.580 --> 2:51:37.740\n it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah.\n\n2:51:37.740 --> 2:52:04.380\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
