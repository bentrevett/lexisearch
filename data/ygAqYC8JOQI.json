00:10.360\n What kind of questions would you ask?\n\n00:12.740 --> 00:15.240\n The following is a conversation with Oliver Stone.\n\n00:15.240 --> 00:17.720\n He's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time\n\n00:17.720 --> 00:21.320\n with three Oscar wins and 11 Oscar nominations.\n\n00:21.320 --> 00:24.840\n His films tell stories of war and power,\n\n00:24.840 --> 00:27.240\n fearlessly and often controversially,\n\n00:27.240 --> 00:28.840\n shining a light on the dark parts\n\n00:28.840 --> 00:31.400\n of American and global history.\n\n00:31.400 --> 00:34.160\n His films include Platoon, Wall Street,\n\n00:34.160 --> 00:37.680\n Born on the 4th of July, Scarface, JFK,\n\n00:37.680 --> 00:41.140\n Nixon, Alexander, W, Snowden,\n\n00:41.140 --> 00:43.760\n and documentaries where he has interviewed\n\n00:43.760 --> 00:46.420\n some of the most powerful and consequential people\n\n00:46.420 --> 00:49.040\n in the world, including Fidel Castro,\n\n00:49.040 --> 00:52.720\n Hugo Chavez, and Vladimir Putin.\n\n00:52.720 --> 00:54.840\n And in this conversation, Oliver and I\n\n00:54.840 --> 00:57.560\n mostly focus our discussion on Vladimir Putin,\n\n00:57.560 --> 01:00.720\n Russia, and the war in Ukraine.\n\n01:00.720 --> 01:02.300\n My goal with these conversations\n\n01:02.300 --> 01:04.840\n is to understand the human being before me,\n\n01:04.840 --> 01:07.280\n to understand not just what they think,\n\n01:07.280 --> 01:10.240\n but how they think, to steel man their ideas,\n\n01:10.240 --> 01:12.800\n and to steel man the devil's advocate,\n\n01:12.800 --> 01:16.600\n all in service of understanding, not derision.\n\n01:16.600 --> 01:18.720\n I have done this poorly in the past.\n\n01:18.720 --> 01:20.560\n I'm still struggling with this,\n\n01:20.560 --> 01:22.580\n but I'm working hard to do better.\n\n01:23.880 --> 01:25.760\n I believe the moment we draw lines\n\n01:25.760 --> 01:28.800\n between good people and evil people\n\n01:28.800 --> 01:32.840\n will lose our ability to see that we're all one people\n\n01:32.840 --> 01:35.160\n in the most fundamental of ways,\n\n01:35.160 --> 01:37.440\n and will lose track of the deep truth\n\n01:37.440 --> 01:40.240\n expressed by the old Solzhenitsyn line\n\n01:40.240 --> 01:42.440\n that I return to time and time again,\n\n01:43.360 --> 01:45.460\n that the line between good and evil\n\n01:45.460 --> 01:47.300\n runs through the heart of every man.\n\n01:48.720 --> 01:50.820\n Oliver Stone has a perspective\n\n01:50.820 --> 01:52.520\n that he extensively documents\n\n01:52.520 --> 01:54.720\n in his powerful controversial series,\n\n01:54.720 --> 01:57.680\n The Untold History of the United States,\n\n01:57.680 --> 02:01.800\n that imperialism and the military industrial complex\n\n02:01.800 --> 02:04.080\n paved the path to absolute power,\n\n02:04.080 --> 02:06.180\n and thus corrupt the minds of the leaders\n\n02:06.180 --> 02:07.860\n and institutions that wield it.\n\n02:08.840 --> 02:10.920\n From this perspective, the way out\n\n02:10.920 --> 02:14.600\n of the humanitarian crisis and human suffering in Ukraine,\n\n02:14.600 --> 02:16.600\n and the way out from the pull\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:18.520\n of the beating drums of nuclear war\n\n02:18.520 --> 02:20.600\n is not simple to understand,\n\n02:20.600 --> 02:24.620\n but we must, because all of humanity hangs in the balance.\n\n02:25.520 --> 02:27.720\n I will talk to many people who seek to understand\n\n02:27.720 --> 02:30.060\n the way out of this growing catastrophe,\n\n02:30.060 --> 02:32.720\n including to historians, to leaders,\n\n02:32.720 --> 02:34.440\n and perhaps most importantly,\n\n02:34.440 --> 02:37.640\n to people on the ground in Ukraine and Russia,\n\n02:37.640 --> 02:39.880\n not just about war and suffering,\n\n02:39.880 --> 02:43.360\n but about life, friendship, family, love, and hope.\n\n02:44.760 --> 02:46.760\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n02:46.760 --> 02:48.960\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n02:48.960 --> 02:51.880\n in the description, and now, dear friends,\n\n02:51.880 --> 02:53.580\n here's Oliver Stone.\n\n02:54.500 --> 02:58.680\n You're working on a documentary now about nuclear energy.\n\n02:58.680 --> 02:59.520\n Yes.\n\n02:59.520 --> 03:01.760\n So it's interesting to talk about this.\n\n03:01.760 --> 03:04.540\n Energy is such a big part of the world,\n\n03:04.540 --> 03:06.440\n about geopolitics of the world,\n\n03:06.440 --> 03:08.300\n about the way the world is.\n\n03:08.300 --> 03:10.440\n What do you think is the role of nuclear energy\n\n03:10.440 --> 03:11.400\n in the 21st century?\n\n03:11.400 --> 03:12.640\n Good question, and first of all,\n\n03:12.640 --> 03:14.960\n obviously everyone's talking about climate change, right?\n\n03:14.960 --> 03:17.760\n So here I wake up to that a few years ago,\n\n03:17.760 --> 03:20.460\n and clearly were concerned.\n\n03:21.920 --> 03:25.360\n I picked up a book by Josh Goldstein\n\n03:25.360 --> 03:27.760\n and his coauthor, who's Swedish.\n\n03:27.760 --> 03:30.280\n Those two wrote a book called A Bright Future.\n\n03:30.280 --> 03:33.680\n It came out a few years ago, and I lapped it up.\n\n03:33.680 --> 03:37.980\n It was a book, fact based, clear,\n\n03:37.980 --> 03:40.640\n not too long, and not too technical,\n\n03:40.640 --> 03:44.040\n and it was very clear that they were in favor\n\n03:44.040 --> 03:49.040\n of all kinds of renewables, renewable energy, yes.\n\n03:49.320 --> 03:53.680\n They made it very clear how dangerous oil\n\n03:53.680 --> 03:56.960\n and gas were, methane,\n\n03:56.960 --> 03:59.840\n and made it very clear to the layman like me,\n\n03:59.840 --> 04:02.900\n and at the same time said that these renewables\n\n04:02.900 --> 04:06.440\n could work so far, but the gap is enormous\n\n04:06.440 --> 04:10.120\n as to how much electricity the world is gonna need\n\n04:10.120 --> 04:14.360\n in 2050 and beyond, two, three, four times.\n\n04:14.360 --> 04:16.640\n We don't even know the damage, but we have India,\n\n04:16.640 --> 04:19.380\n we have China, we have Africa, we have Asia\n\n04:19.380 --> 04:22.920\n coming onto the scene wanting more and more electricity.\n\n04:22.920 --> 04:25.200\n So they address the problem as a global one,\n\n04:25.200 --> 04:27.560\n not just as often in the United States.\n\n04:27.560 --> 04:31.000\n You get the ethnocentric United States point of view\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:34.200\n that we know we're doing well, blah, blah, blah.\n\n04:34.200 --> 04:37.080\n We're not doing well, but we sell that\n\n04:37.080 --> 04:38.440\n to people that we're comfortable.\n\n04:38.440 --> 04:40.560\n We spend more energy than anybody,\n\n04:40.560 --> 04:44.200\n this country per capita, than anybody,\n\n04:44.200 --> 04:47.960\n and at the same time, we don't seem to understand\n\n04:47.960 --> 04:49.760\n the global picture, so that's what they did,\n\n04:49.760 --> 04:50.760\n and they made me very worried.\n\n04:50.760 --> 04:52.700\n So the only way to close that gap,\n\n04:52.700 --> 04:55.800\n the only way in their mind is nuclear energy,\n\n04:55.800 --> 04:58.840\n and talking about a gap of building a huge amount\n\n04:58.840 --> 05:01.680\n of reactors over the next 30 years,\n\n05:01.680 --> 05:08.600\n and starting now, they make that point over and over again.\n\n05:08.600 --> 05:11.840\n So obviously this country, the United States,\n\n05:11.840 --> 05:13.240\n is not gonna go in that direction,\n\n05:13.240 --> 05:17.640\n because it just is incapable of having that kind of will,\n\n05:17.640 --> 05:20.520\n political will, and fear is a huge factor,\n\n05:20.520 --> 05:25.240\n and still a lot of shibboleths, a lot of myths\n\n05:25.240 --> 05:29.520\n about nuclear energy have confused\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:30.920\n and confounded the landscape.\n\n05:30.920 --> 05:33.680\n The environmentalists have played a huge role\n\n05:33.680 --> 05:36.080\n in doing good things, many good things,\n\n05:36.080 --> 05:39.360\n but also confusing and confounding the landscape,\n\n05:39.360 --> 05:41.520\n and making accusations against nuclear energy\n\n05:41.520 --> 05:43.780\n that were exaggerated.\n\n05:45.280 --> 05:48.360\n So taking all these things into consideration,\n\n05:48.360 --> 05:50.100\n we set about making this documentary,\n\n05:50.100 --> 05:53.000\n which is about finished now, almost finishing.\n\n05:53.000 --> 05:56.080\n It's an hour and 40 minutes, and that was a hard part,\n\n05:56.080 --> 05:58.900\n getting it down from about three and a half hours\n\n05:58.900 --> 06:00.880\n to about this, something more manageable,\n\n06:00.880 --> 06:02.760\n and is it interviews?\n\n06:02.760 --> 06:04.440\n It's interviews, among others,\n\n06:04.440 --> 06:07.200\n but essentially we went to Russia, we went to France,\n\n06:07.200 --> 06:10.560\n which is the most, perhaps, advanced nuclear country\n\n06:10.560 --> 06:14.180\n in the world, Russia, and the United States.\n\n06:14.180 --> 06:16.720\n We went to the Idaho laboratory,\n\n06:16.720 --> 06:19.840\n and talked to the scientists there,\n\n06:19.840 --> 06:22.640\n as well as the Department of Energy people\n\n06:22.640 --> 06:23.680\n that are handling this.\n\n06:23.680 --> 06:25.280\n Idaho is one of the experimental labs,\n\n06:25.280 --> 06:27.320\n the United States is probably one of the most advanced,\n\n06:27.320 --> 06:29.960\n and they're doing a lot of advanced nuclear there.\n\n06:29.960 --> 06:34.960\n We also, we studied, well, Russia gave us a lot of insight.\n\n06:36.560 --> 06:37.680\n We're very cooperative,\n\n06:37.680 --> 06:41.080\n because they have some of the most advanced nuclear,\n\n06:41.080 --> 06:43.180\n actually the probably most advanced nuclear reactor\n\n06:43.180 --> 06:46.440\n in the world, at Beloyarsk, at the Ural Mountains.\n\n06:46.440 --> 06:49.740\n So we did an investigation there,\n\n06:49.740 --> 06:54.740\n and in France they have some very advanced nuclear reactors\n\n06:55.400 --> 06:58.400\n and they're building, and now they're building again.\n\n06:58.400 --> 07:01.240\n The Green Party came into power,\n\n07:01.240 --> 07:04.600\n just not into power, but became a factor in France,\n\n07:04.600 --> 07:07.200\n and there was a motion when Hollande was president,\n\n07:07.200 --> 07:08.920\n they started to move away from it.\n\n07:08.920 --> 07:12.100\n Actually, they were beginning to just abandon,\n\n07:13.360 --> 07:17.080\n they let, not complete, in other words,\n\n07:17.080 --> 07:18.640\n close down some of the nuclear reactors,\n\n07:18.640 --> 07:20.920\n there was talk of that, but thank God,\n\n07:20.920 --> 07:23.720\n France did not do that, and Macron came in\n\n07:23.720 --> 07:27.000\n and recently reversed it, reversed it,\n\n07:27.000 --> 07:28.880\n and they're building as fast as they can now,\n\n07:28.880 --> 07:32.200\n especially with the Ukraine war going on,\n\n07:32.200 --> 07:36.640\n there's an awareness that Russia will not be providing,\n\n07:36.640 --> 07:39.840\n may not be providing the energy Europe needs.\n\n07:39.840 --> 07:42.440\n So, and then China is the other one too,\n\n07:42.440 --> 07:45.640\n that's the other factor, I'm talking about the big boys.\n\n07:45.640 --> 07:48.760\n They have, doing tremendous work and fast,\n\n07:48.760 --> 07:51.040\n which is very hopeful, but of course,\n\n07:51.040 --> 07:53.940\n China is building in all directions at once,\n\n07:53.940 --> 07:57.120\n coal continues to be huge in China,\n\n07:57.120 --> 08:01.920\n and methane too,\n\n08:01.920 --> 08:05.240\n but basically coal, coal in India, in China,\n\n08:05.240 --> 08:07.080\n have the biggest users of coal,\n\n08:08.840 --> 08:13.120\n and as you know, Germany went back to coal a few years ago,\n\n08:13.120 --> 08:16.000\n so all these factors, it's a fascinating picture globally,\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.840\n so we try to achieve a consensus that where nuclear can work\n\n08:20.840 --> 08:22.760\n and where it will be working,\n\n08:22.760 --> 08:24.960\n where it will be used more and more,\n\n08:24.960 --> 08:28.400\n the question is how much carbon dioxide China\n\n08:28.400 --> 08:30.840\n and Russia will be putting out.\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:33.240\n France is the only one that's not putting it out.\n\n08:33.240 --> 08:34.680\n The United States has not changed,\n\n08:34.680 --> 08:38.640\n with all the talk and all the nonsense about renewables\n\n08:38.640 --> 08:41.400\n and the new lifestyle and all this,\n\n08:41.400 --> 08:43.320\n it's great for your guilt complex,\n\n08:43.320 --> 08:47.240\n but it doesn't do anything for the total accumulation\n\n08:47.240 --> 08:48.680\n of carbon dioxide in the world.\n\n08:48.680 --> 08:51.120\n Who's gonna lead the way on nuclear, do you think?\n\n08:51.120 --> 08:54.080\n You mentioned Russia, France, China, United States,\n\n08:54.080 --> 08:54.920\n who's gonna lead?\n\n08:54.920 --> 08:56.120\n Yeah, I don't think it's gonna be\n\n08:56.120 --> 08:58.240\n a United Nations kind of thing,\n\n08:58.240 --> 09:01.040\n because the world doesn't seem capable of uniting.\n\n09:01.040 --> 09:03.880\n We go to these conferences, Kyoto,\n\n09:03.880 --> 09:06.840\n and we talk and we agree,\n\n09:06.840 --> 09:08.400\n but then we don't actually enforce,\n\n09:08.400 --> 09:09.740\n so I don't think it can happen that way.\n\n09:09.740 --> 09:13.120\n I think it's gonna be an individual race with countries.\n\n09:13.120 --> 09:16.200\n They're gonna just do it for their own self interest,\n\n09:16.200 --> 09:18.140\n like China's doing it.\n\n09:18.140 --> 09:21.480\n China, the thing is, if it works, and I'm praying\n\n09:21.480 --> 09:23.680\n that it will really work on a big scale,\n\n09:23.680 --> 09:26.240\n China will back away from coal naturally.\n\n09:26.240 --> 09:27.960\n The same thing will be true of India.\n\n09:27.960 --> 09:31.240\n They will see the benefits, because if you go to India,\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:33.040\n you see the cities, the pollution.\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:35.520\n You walk around in that stuff, and you get,\n\n09:35.520 --> 09:39.040\n it's not, there's no hope in this, and you sense it.\n\n09:39.040 --> 09:41.760\n So people will move in this direction naturally,\n\n09:41.760 --> 09:44.840\n because nuclear is clean energy.\n\n09:44.840 --> 09:48.600\n And the amount of casualties of nuclear\n\n09:48.600 --> 09:50.800\n is the lowest on the industrial scale\n\n09:50.800 --> 09:54.360\n for energy producing, from coal down to oil, everything.\n\n09:54.360 --> 09:57.680\n The lowest casualty rate, very lowest,\n\n09:57.680 --> 10:00.880\n.002 or something, is nuclear.\n\n10:00.880 --> 10:04.120\n So not that many people have died from nuclear.\n\n10:04.120 --> 10:07.600\n Not that many, I think 50 people at Chernobyl,\n\n10:07.600 --> 10:09.640\n which was the worst accident.\n\n10:09.640 --> 10:12.160\n Nobody had died at Fukushima.\n\n10:12.160 --> 10:13.820\n Nobody died at Three Mile Island,\n\n10:13.820 --> 10:16.440\n and that's what you hear all over and over again,\n\n10:16.440 --> 10:17.960\n these accidents.\n\n10:19.520 --> 10:22.480\n The environmentalists have sold us the idea\n\n10:22.480 --> 10:23.680\n that they're dangerous.\n\n10:24.960 --> 10:27.560\n And it's, a lot of environmentalists, thank God,\n\n10:27.560 --> 10:29.680\n are changing, they've come off that routine,\n\n10:29.680 --> 10:32.400\n and they've saying, this, we were wrong.\n\n10:32.400 --> 10:34.040\n We've done a lot of good work.\n\n10:34.040 --> 10:35.480\n Greenpeace did a lot of good work.\n\n10:35.480 --> 10:38.560\n Whale, whales, saving this, saving that.\n\n10:38.560 --> 10:41.480\n But they admit themselves, not they don't,\n\n10:41.480 --> 10:44.360\n but people who have been in the organization\n\n10:44.360 --> 10:46.680\n have said, we were wrong.\n\n10:46.680 --> 10:51.680\n In 1956, we show the articles\n\n10:51.920 --> 10:54.080\n in the New York Times that came out,\n\n10:54.080 --> 10:56.280\n the Rockefeller Foundation,\n\n10:56.280 --> 11:00.360\n which of course is a big producer of oil,\n\n11:00.360 --> 11:04.160\n the Rockefeller family, and the foundation came out\n\n11:05.960 --> 11:09.960\n with a study, which was weighted.\n\n11:09.960 --> 11:13.360\n They tipped the scale, put a thumb on the scale,\n\n11:13.360 --> 11:17.440\n but it was a scientific expose of radiation\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:22.220\n in the study that came out, printed in the New York Times,\n\n11:22.220 --> 11:24.720\n because the New York Times publisher, Salzburger,\n\n11:24.720 --> 11:28.080\n was on their board, he was one of the board members.\n\n11:28.080 --> 11:32.840\n So they got a lot of strong publicity\n\n11:32.840 --> 11:36.320\n condemning radiation, which killed,\n\n11:36.320 --> 11:39.040\n started the process of doubting nuclear energy.\n\n11:39.040 --> 11:40.920\n The radiation levels that they pointed out\n\n11:40.920 --> 11:43.400\n were very minor, and of course,\n\n11:43.400 --> 11:46.200\n if you go into a scientific analysis of this now\n\n11:46.200 --> 11:49.120\n with what we know, it's just not true.\n\n11:49.120 --> 11:52.280\n But it tilted the scale back in the 50s, 60s,\n\n11:52.280 --> 11:56.520\n and started the questioning the nuclear business.\n\n11:56.520 --> 11:59.000\n Do you think that was malevolence or incompetence?\n\n11:59.000 --> 12:01.200\n No, I think it was competition.\n\n12:01.200 --> 12:02.480\n I don't think it was conspiracy\n\n12:02.480 --> 12:04.080\n as much as it was essentially,\n\n12:04.080 --> 12:07.160\n we don't want this, nuclear energy's gonna end\n\n12:07.160 --> 12:10.640\n the dominance of oil, absolutely, and it will.\n\n12:10.640 --> 12:13.080\n And it will anyway, because it's the only sane way\n\n12:13.080 --> 12:14.480\n for the world to proceed.\n\n12:14.480 --> 12:19.420\n But the world will have to learn through adversity.\n\n12:20.640 --> 12:23.560\n So in other words, this situation could get worse,\n\n12:23.560 --> 12:25.920\n much worse, and certain countries\n\n12:25.920 --> 12:28.240\n are just gonna have to adapt, like we always do.\n\n12:28.240 --> 12:30.960\n When things become too hard, you've got to go,\n\n12:30.960 --> 12:33.400\n you have to change your thinking.\n\n12:33.400 --> 12:35.200\n And humans are pretty good at that.\n\n12:35.200 --> 12:37.920\n Yes, talking about human nature, they're very adept\n\n12:37.920 --> 12:40.080\n at that, Germany, for example.\n\n12:40.080 --> 12:42.480\n I mean, they were, when the Fukushima happened,\n\n12:42.480 --> 12:44.080\n they went out of the nuclear business.\n\n12:44.080 --> 12:45.400\n That was shocking to me.\n\n12:46.660 --> 12:49.320\n They just pulled out and they destroyed,\n\n12:49.320 --> 12:51.440\n destructed several of their nuclear reactors\n\n12:51.440 --> 12:54.920\n who were still functioning, and put up coal,\n\n12:54.920 --> 12:59.360\n or yeah, put up coal and oil, replaced it.\n\n12:59.360 --> 13:03.560\n And as a result, Germany drifted into this place\n\n13:03.560 --> 13:07.160\n next to France, their electricity bills went up,\n\n13:07.160 --> 13:09.500\n and France stayed the same.\n\n13:09.500 --> 13:11.240\n They don't have that, they have a different system\n\n13:11.240 --> 13:13.760\n in Europe, but more or less, no question that France\n\n13:13.760 --> 13:15.840\n was doing a lot better than Germany.\n\n13:15.840 --> 13:18.880\n And now, with this Ukraine issue,\n\n13:18.880 --> 13:20.840\n it's a very interesting fulcrum point,\n\n13:20.840 --> 13:25.680\n whether Germany is, what direction they're gonna go now.\n\n13:25.680 --> 13:29.240\n How can they, how can they keep going with coal?\n\n13:29.240 --> 13:30.080\n They just can't.\n\n13:30.080 --> 13:35.080\n What's the connection between oil, coal, nuclear, and war?\n\n13:36.640 --> 13:40.240\n Sort of energy and conflict.\n\n13:41.560 --> 13:43.280\n When you look at the 21st century,\n\n13:43.280 --> 13:45.160\n when you were doing this documentary,\n\n13:45.160 --> 13:48.200\n were you thinking of nuclear as a way to power the world,\n\n13:48.200 --> 13:52.480\n but is it also to avoid conflict over resources?\n\n13:53.660 --> 13:57.120\n Is there some aspect to energy being a source of conflict\n\n13:57.120 --> 14:02.120\n that we're trying to avoid?\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:06.960\n I don't have the energy, the history of energy\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:11.960\n at my fingertips, and it's a very long history here.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:15.520\n But I would say, apparently not.\n\n14:15.520 --> 14:18.080\n It does seem that individually, each country\n\n14:18.080 --> 14:21.320\n can answer its needs by building.\n\n14:21.320 --> 14:24.560\n And up until now, we haven't had conflict,\n\n14:24.560 --> 14:28.280\n except in this issue of Russia supplying Europe.\n\n14:31.040 --> 14:34.880\n Obviously, the pipeline, Nord Stream 2 has been closed,\n\n14:34.880 --> 14:38.840\n and Nord Stream 1 is also probably gonna be phased out.\n\n14:38.840 --> 14:43.840\n And the concept of Russia supplying gas to Europe\n\n14:44.360 --> 14:47.480\n is now up in the air, and who knows what's gonna happen.\n\n14:47.480 --> 14:50.800\n I just don't see how Europe can get away\n\n14:50.800 --> 14:53.880\n from using Russian gas.\n\n14:53.880 --> 14:55.460\n But Russian gas is not the solution,\n\n14:55.460 --> 14:57.440\n because it's methane, too, and it goes up\n\n14:57.440 --> 14:58.780\n into the atmosphere.\n\n14:58.780 --> 15:03.780\n Methane, in the short term, is worse than coal, worse.\n\n15:04.640 --> 15:06.760\n There's all kinds of charts we show in the film.\n\n15:06.760 --> 15:09.320\n We try not to be too overfactual,\n\n15:09.320 --> 15:12.940\n but methane is not the answer.\n\n15:12.940 --> 15:14.260\n It's a short term answer.\n\n15:18.580 --> 15:22.040\n Will countries go to war over energy is a question\n\n15:22.040 --> 15:24.840\n that I'm trying to think of all the wars that happened.\n\n15:25.800 --> 15:28.160\n You could say Germany, of course, during World War II\n\n15:28.160 --> 15:32.480\n needed oil very badly, and it dictated their strategy\n\n15:32.480 --> 15:36.800\n with Romania, et cetera, and getting the oil fields open.\n\n15:36.800 --> 15:40.720\n But I haven't thought that one through.\n\n15:40.720 --> 15:42.240\n I'd have to make a documentary on it\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:47.240\n to really understand how energy and war interface.\n\n15:47.720 --> 15:49.180\n It's always part of the calculation,\n\n15:49.180 --> 15:51.600\n but it's a question of how much.\n\n15:51.600 --> 15:53.320\n Right, that's the question.\n\n15:53.320 --> 15:55.000\n I just have to ask, because you mentioned\n\n15:55.000 --> 15:57.480\n your mom was from France, you've traveled\n\n15:57.480 --> 16:00.280\n for this documentary, and you traveled in general\n\n16:00.280 --> 16:03.140\n throughout the world in Russia, Ukraine.\n\n16:04.760 --> 16:07.820\n What are the defining characteristics of these cultures?\n\n16:07.820 --> 16:09.480\n Let's go with Russia.\n\n16:09.480 --> 16:14.480\n So as I told you, I'm half Ukrainian, half Russian.\n\n16:14.520 --> 16:16.280\n I came from that part of the world.\n\n16:16.280 --> 16:18.840\n What are some interesting, beautiful aspects\n\n16:18.840 --> 16:21.600\n of the culture of Russia and Ukraine?\n\n16:21.600 --> 16:23.760\n I can't really speak honestly of Ukraine.\n\n16:23.760 --> 16:28.080\n I was there only in 1983 when I visited\n\n16:28.080 --> 16:30.560\n the Soviet Union under the communism,\n\n16:30.560 --> 16:34.080\n and Kiev was beautiful and was one of the nicer places\n\n16:34.080 --> 16:38.020\n I went, but they were very much stultified\n\n16:38.020 --> 16:41.260\n by the communist system, they all were.\n\n16:41.260 --> 16:43.760\n The best places to visit in Russia were always in the South,\n\n16:43.760 --> 16:48.760\n whether Georgia or the Muslim countries,\n\n16:49.120 --> 16:52.520\n it was always a better culture in terms of comfort.\n\n16:52.520 --> 16:55.120\n But communism was rough, and that was the end of it,\n\n16:55.120 --> 16:58.720\n pretty much Brezhnev regime, and then Andropov.\n\n16:58.720 --> 17:01.840\n Gorbachev was three years in the future when I was there.\n\n17:01.840 --> 17:05.680\n So I can't talk about Ukraine, and they've not been friendly\n\n17:05.680 --> 17:08.160\n to me since ISIS, of course, since I made\n\n17:08.160 --> 17:11.640\n the Putin interviews, you know, Ukraine has banned me,\n\n17:11.640 --> 17:14.320\n I believe, they've been very tough on people\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:16.200\n who are critical.\n\n17:16.200 --> 17:19.520\n I think the Russian people have been very special to me,\n\n17:19.520 --> 17:22.460\n and perhaps because of my European upbringing,\n\n17:22.460 --> 17:25.000\n but I enjoy talking to them, I find them very open,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:29.320\n very generous, and they appreciate support,\n\n17:29.320 --> 17:31.640\n they appreciate people who say, you know,\n\n17:31.640 --> 17:33.840\n I understand why your government is doing this\n\n17:33.840 --> 17:36.720\n or this or this, I've tried to stay open minded\n\n17:36.720 --> 17:39.140\n and listen to both sides.\n\n17:39.140 --> 17:42.040\n The thing that I have seen as an American is, of course,\n\n17:42.040 --> 17:46.520\n this American enmity towards Russia from the very beginning.\n\n17:46.520 --> 17:50.640\n I grew up in 1940, 46, I was born in the 50s,\n\n17:50.640 --> 17:54.720\n it was so anti Russian, they were everywhere,\n\n17:54.720 --> 17:57.080\n they were in our schools, they were in our State Department,\n\n17:57.080 --> 18:01.600\n they were spying on us, they were stealing the country\n\n18:01.600 --> 18:05.640\n from us, that was the way the American right wing,\n\n18:05.640 --> 18:08.280\n not even the right wing, I'd say the Republican party,\n\n18:08.280 --> 18:11.800\n pictured the Russians, they were actively engaged\n\n18:11.800 --> 18:15.720\n in infiltrating America and changing our thinking.\n\n18:15.720 --> 18:17.840\n And television shows were based on this,\n\n18:17.840 --> 18:21.080\n it was very much the J. Edgar Hoover mentality\n\n18:21.080 --> 18:24.960\n that communism was even behind the student protests\n\n18:24.960 --> 18:28.640\n of the 1960s, this was the direction in which the FBI\n\n18:28.640 --> 18:30.720\n and the CIA were thinking.\n\n18:30.720 --> 18:35.240\n So I grew up with a prejudice, and it took me many years,\n\n18:35.240 --> 18:38.800\n my father was a Republican and he was a stockbroker\n\n18:38.800 --> 18:41.400\n and he was a very intelligent man, but even he,\n\n18:41.400 --> 18:45.440\n because he was a World War II soldier, he was a colonel,\n\n18:45.440 --> 18:47.480\n had fallen under the influence.\n\n18:47.480 --> 18:50.080\n In order to be successful in American business\n\n18:50.080 --> 18:53.400\n in the 1950s, you had to have a very strong\n\n18:53.400 --> 18:58.080\n anti Soviet line, very strong, you wouldn't get ahead.\n\n18:58.080 --> 19:01.640\n If you expressed any kind of, let's end this Cold War,\n\n19:01.640 --> 19:04.640\n any kind of activity of that nature, you'd be cast aside\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:09.640\n as a pinko or somebody who was not completely\n\n19:09.840 --> 19:12.360\n on the board with the American way of doing business,\n\n19:12.360 --> 19:15.020\n which was capitalism works, communism doesn't.\n\n19:16.280 --> 19:19.680\n And in particular, communism was embodied\n\n19:19.680 --> 19:24.400\n by the Soviet Union as the enemy.\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:29.400\n So hence the narrative behind the Cold War.\n\n19:29.400 --> 19:33.560\n Behind the Cold War, that's correct, and it basically\n\n19:33.560 --> 19:37.480\n lasted, I mean, you saw the ups and downs of it.\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:40.000\n When Reagan came in, I was, well, first of all,\n\n19:40.000 --> 19:44.000\n we had the crisis of 1962 with the Cuban Missile Crisis,\n\n19:44.000 --> 19:47.520\n and Kennedy proved himself to be a warrior for peace.\n\n19:47.520 --> 19:49.360\n He resolved that with Khrushchev.\n\n19:49.360 --> 19:52.240\n That was a big moment, huge moment, and people don't\n\n19:52.240 --> 19:56.400\n give him credit enough for really saving us from a war\n\n19:56.400 --> 19:59.480\n that could have affected all of mankind.\n\n19:59.480 --> 20:02.800\n But it still didn't avert.\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:05.760\n No, because the moment he was killed,\n\n20:05.760 --> 20:08.440\n honestly, there was a lot of, we can talk about that,\n\n20:08.440 --> 20:11.240\n and as you know, I've made a film, JFK Revisited\n\n20:11.240 --> 20:14.520\n is a documentary we released this year\n\n20:14.520 --> 20:18.600\n about the movie I made in 1991.\n\n20:18.600 --> 20:21.680\n But the moment he was killed, I would argue\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:24.200\n that Lyndon Johnson went back immediately\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:26.760\n to the old way of thinking, the old way of doing business,\n\n20:26.760 --> 20:30.360\n which was the Eisenhower, Truman way,\n\n20:30.360 --> 20:33.280\n which we had adapted since World War II.\n\n20:33.280 --> 20:34.800\n That was an interim.\n\n20:34.800 --> 20:37.520\n You have to think about it from, Roosevelt dies in 45.\n\n20:37.520 --> 20:42.080\n Roosevelt has an interim of 15 years where he,\n\n20:44.520 --> 20:47.200\n he has more of a democratic regime, more liberal.\n\n20:47.200 --> 20:49.600\n He establishes, he recognizes the Soviet Union\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:52.000\n for the first time since the revolution,\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.640\n and he actually has a relationship with them.\n\n20:54.640 --> 20:56.920\n He sends ambassadors who are friendly,\n\n20:56.920 --> 21:01.440\n and he has a relationship with Stalin, et cetera,\n\n21:01.440 --> 21:05.880\n and at Yalta, or no, at Tehran, rather,\n\n21:05.880 --> 21:08.000\n that's where he had the relationship.\n\n21:08.000 --> 21:10.840\n Do you think if JFK lived, we would not have a Cold War?\n\n21:10.840 --> 21:14.600\n No, absolutely not, and we go into great depth on that\n\n21:14.600 --> 21:17.000\n in the film, and I'd urge you to see it,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:19.480\n because it goes into all the issues around the world.\n\n21:19.480 --> 21:21.920\n Kennedy was being very much an anti imperialist.\n\n21:21.920 --> 21:24.880\n It turns out, and many people just don't understand that,\n\n21:24.880 --> 21:28.520\n but you have to look at all his policies in Middle East\n\n21:28.520 --> 21:32.760\n with Nasser, he had a relationship with Sukarno in Indonesia,\n\n21:33.840 --> 21:35.760\n with Latin America, he made a big effort\n\n21:35.760 --> 21:37.640\n with the Alliance for Progress,\n\n21:37.640 --> 21:40.800\n and when Africa, above all, with Lumumba,\n\n21:40.800 --> 21:42.760\n he was very shocked at his death,\n\n21:42.760 --> 21:47.760\n and tried to defend the right, the integrity\n\n21:47.840 --> 21:51.360\n of the Belgian Congo with Dag Hammarskjold of the UN.\n\n21:51.360 --> 21:52.840\n He made a big effort.\n\n21:52.840 --> 21:55.240\n Unfortunately, it didn't work out,\n\n21:55.240 --> 21:57.280\n because Dag Hammarskjold was killed,\n\n21:57.280 --> 21:58.840\n and then Kennedy was killed,\n\n21:58.840 --> 22:01.400\n and Congo descended into the chaos\n\n22:01.400 --> 22:03.240\n of Joseph Mobutu's dictatorship.\n\n22:04.560 --> 22:07.040\n But Kennedy was very active in terms of,\n\n22:07.040 --> 22:10.720\n as an Irishman, not as an Englishman, he was an Irishman.\n\n22:10.720 --> 22:12.880\n And I say that because, well, we'll come back to that,\n\n22:12.880 --> 22:14.600\n because Mr. Joe Biden is an Irishman,\n\n22:14.600 --> 22:16.040\n but it's a different kind of an Irishman.\n\n22:16.040 --> 22:19.400\n They're both Catholic Irish, but Kennedy really made\n\n22:19.400 --> 22:24.400\n an effort to change the imperialist mindset\n\n22:25.320 --> 22:30.000\n that still was very strong in America and Europe.\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.160\n Lyndon Johnson changed back to the old policy,\n\n22:33.160 --> 22:36.360\n and we were never able to really keep\n\n22:36.360 --> 22:37.800\n big talk going with the Russians.\n\n22:37.800 --> 22:42.800\n Briefly had it with Carter, but then Brzezinski came in.\n\n22:42.800 --> 22:45.480\n Brzezinski was his national security advisor.\n\n22:45.480 --> 22:47.000\n He was put there by Rockefeller,\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:50.760\n and Brzezinski was a Pole, he got revenge from Poland.\n\n22:50.760 --> 22:53.080\n Poland has always been attacking Russia,\n\n22:53.080 --> 22:55.760\n as far as I remember, back to another century.\n\n22:55.760 --> 22:58.960\n I mean, the two world wars that occupied Russia,\n\n22:58.960 --> 23:02.360\n so tragically, entry points were always\n\n23:02.360 --> 23:03.760\n through Poland and Ukraine.\n\n23:05.360 --> 23:07.720\n So Brzezinski got his revenge,\n\n23:07.720 --> 23:11.600\n and Carter ended up being an enemy of the Soviet Union,\n\n23:11.600 --> 23:15.240\n and creating, as Brzezinski took pride in it,\n\n23:15.240 --> 23:16.880\n he created the atmosphere of the trap\n\n23:16.880 --> 23:20.600\n for the Soviets to go into Afghanistan in 79.\n\n23:20.600 --> 23:24.120\n That trap was set, he says, he said, in 1978.\n\n23:26.240 --> 23:29.400\n So there was never, except for brief moments,\n\n23:29.400 --> 23:33.240\n periods of detente with the Soviets,\n\n23:33.240 --> 23:35.200\n and I grew up under that.\n\n23:35.200 --> 23:37.800\n I didn't really know anything of this going on,\n\n23:37.800 --> 23:40.600\n because I was learning, I was educating myself\n\n23:40.600 --> 23:42.200\n as I was going, learning movies,\n\n23:42.200 --> 23:45.040\n and trying to be a dramatist, and this and that,\n\n23:45.040 --> 23:47.280\n so I wasn't thinking about this.\n\n23:47.280 --> 23:50.440\n Then, when Reagan came in, I was worried again,\n\n23:50.440 --> 23:52.520\n because it was the beat of the old beat,\n\n23:52.520 --> 23:54.840\n which was there, the most evil empire.\n\n23:54.840 --> 23:57.720\n I mean, it goes on in American history, it doesn't end.\n\n23:57.720 --> 24:00.080\n Reagan got a lot of points for that,\n\n24:00.080 --> 24:04.600\n and of course, when Gorbachev came in,\n\n24:04.600 --> 24:07.360\n it was a beautiful moment for the world.\n\n24:07.360 --> 24:09.000\n It was a great surprise.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.480\n It was probably the best years for America,\n\n24:11.480 --> 24:13.040\n at least from my point of view,\n\n24:13.040 --> 24:16.280\n in terms of this relaxation in the mood.\n\n24:16.280 --> 24:21.280\n 1986 to 1991 were great years\n\n24:21.560 --> 24:24.400\n in terms of ability to believe, once again,\n\n24:24.400 --> 24:27.040\n that there could be a peace dividend,\n\n24:27.040 --> 24:30.080\n but the world changed again in 1991, 92.\n\n24:30.080 --> 24:31.880\n There's an internal mechanism, who knows?\n\n24:31.880 --> 24:35.000\n You could blame the United States,\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:36.680\n you could blame Russia for...\n\n24:39.040 --> 24:41.080\n Gorbachev was perhaps not the right man\n\n24:41.080 --> 24:43.400\n to try to administer that country at that point.\n\n24:43.400 --> 24:47.120\n He had great visions, he was a man of peace,\n\n24:47.120 --> 24:48.880\n but it was very difficult to hold together\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:50.080\n such a huge empire.\n\n24:50.080 --> 24:53.520\n So vision is not enough to hold together the Soviet Union?\n\n24:53.520 --> 24:56.360\n I think the details are interesting.\n\n24:56.360 --> 24:58.000\n I followed up on that a little bit,\n\n24:58.000 --> 25:01.520\n because I was recently in countries like Kazakhstan,\n\n25:01.520 --> 25:05.360\n talked about the negotiations that were going on,\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:08.360\n and the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\n25:08.360 --> 25:09.800\n It's a very interesting story,\n\n25:09.800 --> 25:12.160\n because it involves everything, Ukraine, of course,\n\n25:12.160 --> 25:14.080\n everything that's going on now.\n\n25:14.080 --> 25:15.760\n Some, what is it, 30 million Russians\n\n25:15.760 --> 25:19.320\n were left outside of the Soviet Union when it collapsed.\n\n25:19.320 --> 25:21.840\n They had no home anymore, they were homes\n\n25:21.840 --> 25:23.760\n in other countries, such as in Ukraine.\n\n25:25.640 --> 25:29.240\n So it's an interesting story, and with repercussions today,\n\n25:30.200 --> 25:34.520\n Kazakhstan is a good example of keeping a balance,\n\n25:34.520 --> 25:36.160\n keeping it neutral.\n\n25:36.160 --> 25:37.840\n He played both sides,\n\n25:37.840 --> 25:41.520\n and because Yeltsin wanted him\n\n25:41.520 --> 25:45.320\n to join the Russian Confederation\n\n25:45.320 --> 25:48.640\n in a certain way where he'd be supporting,\n\n25:48.640 --> 25:52.000\n against Gorbachev, there's a whole inward battle there.\n\n25:53.400 --> 25:57.800\n I think the Ukraine came along with Yeltsin,\n\n25:57.800 --> 26:02.280\n as well as, I'm sorry, I don't remember now,\n\n26:02.280 --> 26:04.760\n but two other regions came with him,\n\n26:04.760 --> 26:09.240\n and that was a block that broke up the Soviet Union.\n\n26:09.240 --> 26:12.280\n It was Yeltsin's plan to,\n\n26:12.280 --> 26:15.760\n and it wasn't make the Russian Federation, and they did.\n\n26:15.760 --> 26:19.240\n I would love to return back to JFK eventually,\n\n26:19.240 --> 26:20.640\n because he's such a fascinating figure\n\n26:20.640 --> 26:23.600\n in the history of human civilization,\n\n26:23.600 --> 26:26.200\n but let me ask you, fast forward.\n\n26:26.200 --> 26:29.720\n In 2000, Yeltsin was no longer president,\n\n26:29.720 --> 26:32.440\n and Vladimir Putin became president.\n\n26:32.440 --> 26:36.600\n You did a series of interviews with Vladimir Putin,\n\n26:36.600 --> 26:39.080\n as you mentioned, over a period of two years,\n\n26:39.080 --> 26:41.500\n from 2015 to 2017.\n\n26:43.080 --> 26:45.740\n Let me ask with a high level question.\n\n26:45.740 --> 26:49.720\n What was your goal with that conversation?\n\n26:49.720 --> 26:54.240\n Oh, came out in 2017, I guess I started them in 2014.\n\n26:55.440 --> 26:58.560\n At that point, the Snowden affair had happened,\n\n26:58.560 --> 27:00.760\n and I was working on a movie on Snowden.\n\n27:00.760 --> 27:05.760\n That happened in 13, Ukraine happened in 14,\n\n27:08.200 --> 27:10.880\n and one thing after another.\n\n27:10.880 --> 27:14.640\n By 14, Putin was enemy number, again,\n\n27:14.640 --> 27:17.200\n becoming a wanted man on the American list.\n\n27:17.200 --> 27:20.580\n He was enemy, he was certainly in the top five.\n\n27:22.480 --> 27:24.720\n But the animosity towards Putin\n\n27:24.720 --> 27:27.840\n had been growing since 2007 at Munich.\n\n27:27.840 --> 27:29.880\n I remember that speech when he made it.\n\n27:29.880 --> 27:32.720\n It's in my documentary, that's a four hour documentary,\n\n27:32.720 --> 27:34.000\n four different conversations.\n\n27:34.000 --> 27:37.660\n I mean, we talked over two years, two and a half years,\n\n27:37.660 --> 27:40.080\n but I remember that image of him at Munich\n\n27:40.080 --> 27:44.980\n making a very important speech about world harmony,\n\n27:44.980 --> 27:47.480\n about the balance necessary in the world,\n\n27:47.480 --> 27:52.200\n and I remember the sneer, the sneer on John McCain's face.\n\n27:52.200 --> 27:55.460\n He was in Munich, obviously eyeballing Putin\n\n27:55.460 --> 27:57.760\n and hating him, and it was so evident\n\n27:57.760 --> 28:01.160\n that McCain had no belief whatsoever that this,\n\n28:01.160 --> 28:03.080\n he was almost treating him like these are the communists\n\n28:03.080 --> 28:05.840\n are back, and we know that Putin was not a communist.\n\n28:05.840 --> 28:07.840\n We know that Putin is very much a market man,\n\n28:07.840 --> 28:12.840\n and he made it very clear and tried to keep an open climate,\n\n28:13.340 --> 28:15.000\n a new relationship with Europe,\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.160\n but the United States always, certain people\n\n28:17.160 --> 28:18.800\n in the United States always saw that as a threat,\n\n28:18.800 --> 28:21.580\n like Putin is trying to take Europe away from us\n\n28:21.580 --> 28:24.800\n as if we own it, as if we have the right to own it.\n\n28:24.800 --> 28:26.720\n But Putin was making the point, it's very important,\n\n28:26.720 --> 28:31.600\n about sovereignty, and sovereignty for countries\n\n28:31.600 --> 28:35.000\n is crucial for this new world to have balance.\n\n28:35.000 --> 28:38.240\n That's sovereignty for China, sovereignty for Russia,\n\n28:38.240 --> 28:41.920\n sovereignty for Iran, sovereignty for Venezuela,\n\n28:41.920 --> 28:43.240\n sovereignty for Cuba.\n\n28:43.240 --> 28:45.960\n This is an idea that's crucial to the new world,\n\n28:45.960 --> 28:48.600\n and I think the United States has never accepted that.\n\n28:49.760 --> 28:53.480\n Sovereignty is not an idea that they can allow.\n\n28:53.480 --> 28:58.480\n You have to be obedient to the United States idea\n\n28:58.960 --> 29:02.240\n of so called democracy and freedom,\n\n29:02.240 --> 29:07.120\n but much more important is sovereignty for these countries,\n\n29:07.120 --> 29:08.880\n and the United States has not obeyed that,\n\n29:08.880 --> 29:13.600\n has not even acknowledged it, and it never comes up.\n\n29:13.600 --> 29:15.600\n So from the perspective of the United States,\n\n29:15.600 --> 29:18.440\n when power centers arise in the world,\n\n29:18.440 --> 29:23.440\n you start to oppose those, not because of the ideas,\n\n29:24.740 --> 29:28.460\n but merely because they have power.\n\n29:28.460 --> 29:30.660\n Isn't that at the heart of the doctrine\n\n29:30.660 --> 29:32.780\n of the neoconservatives,\n\n29:32.780 --> 29:34.940\n and the pact for the new American century\n\n29:34.940 --> 29:38.220\n they wrote down in 1996, seven,\n\n29:38.220 --> 29:41.700\n they said there shall be no emergence of a rival power.\n\n29:41.700 --> 29:43.980\n It was very clear it was about power,\n\n29:43.980 --> 29:46.480\n and they've stuck to that doctrine,\n\n29:46.480 --> 29:49.340\n which is if you start to get dangerous in any way\n\n29:49.340 --> 29:51.620\n or have power, we're gonna knock you out.\n\n29:52.680 --> 29:56.000\n Now that won't work, and I don't believe it can work,\n\n29:56.000 --> 29:58.220\n and that is unfortunately a policy\n\n29:58.220 --> 30:00.140\n the United States is following,\n\n30:00.140 --> 30:04.180\n and the neoconservatives group, which is very small,\n\n30:04.180 --> 30:05.660\n but it's very strong apparently,\n\n30:05.660 --> 30:08.020\n and their idea has resonated.\n\n30:08.020 --> 30:12.640\n It was behind the George Bush's invasion of Iraq.\n\n30:12.640 --> 30:14.560\n It was part of not only Iraq,\n\n30:14.560 --> 30:17.780\n but cleaning out the whole world, draining the swamp,\n\n30:17.780 --> 30:19.220\n going to Afghanistan first,\n\n30:19.220 --> 30:21.660\n and then although Iraq had nothing to do\n\n30:21.660 --> 30:24.880\n with al Qaeda's attack, going after Iraq.\n\n30:25.960 --> 30:28.100\n And of course 60 some other countries\n\n30:28.100 --> 30:33.100\n that were terrorism had some signs of,\n\n30:34.740 --> 30:38.260\n wherever America judged would be a dangerous country.\n\n30:38.260 --> 30:41.300\n We had the right, you're either with us or against us.\n\n30:41.300 --> 30:43.540\n Now that is a disastrous policy,\n\n30:43.540 --> 30:45.160\n and led to one thing after another.\n\n30:45.160 --> 30:47.160\n The Iraq war never learned a lesson.\n\n30:48.060 --> 30:50.180\n The neoconservatives were never fired,\n\n30:50.180 --> 30:51.540\n never thrown out of office.\n\n30:51.540 --> 30:55.280\n The people who prosecuted that war are still around.\n\n30:55.280 --> 30:57.340\n Many of them are still around,\n\n30:57.340 --> 31:00.260\n and they're obviously guiding America now.\n\n31:00.260 --> 31:03.540\n Let me return to this question of power.\n\n31:03.540 --> 31:07.220\n Don't forget the sneer that I saw there.\n\n31:07.220 --> 31:09.440\n That emblemized the United States reaction.\n\n31:09.440 --> 31:12.580\n Also there were several other American representatives\n\n31:12.580 --> 31:16.180\n who were laughing, kind of mocking Putin.\n\n31:16.180 --> 31:17.280\n It was very serious.\n\n31:17.280 --> 31:20.120\n I felt there was a divide there.\n\n31:21.780 --> 31:25.100\n So since then, I mean in a certain sense,\n\n31:25.100 --> 31:27.740\n the Europe reaction to Putin is crucial,\n\n31:27.740 --> 31:31.060\n and they were more with him back then.\n\n31:31.060 --> 31:34.460\n And a big thing for America was always to keep NATO,\n\n31:34.460 --> 31:37.500\n to keep Europe in its pocket as a satellite.\n\n31:37.500 --> 31:40.700\n And with this recent war, of course they've succeeded\n\n31:40.700 --> 31:42.620\n in beyond their dreams.\n\n31:42.620 --> 31:44.780\n The Russians have fulfilled the fantasy\n\n31:44.780 --> 31:47.820\n of the United States, to finally be this aggressor\n\n31:47.820 --> 31:50.180\n that they have pictured for years.\n\n31:50.180 --> 31:51.640\n We can talk about that later.\n\n31:51.640 --> 31:56.640\n But at that time, Europe had significant support for Putin,\n\n31:58.180 --> 32:01.700\n and the United States was sneering at Putin.\n\n32:01.700 --> 32:03.380\n That's correct, you can say that.\n\n32:03.380 --> 32:05.300\n And then, so there was this,\n\n32:05.300 --> 32:10.300\n there was uncertainty as to the direction,\n\n32:12.220 --> 32:13.420\n as to the future of Russia.\n\n32:13.420 --> 32:16.900\n And that's exactly when you interviewed Vladimir Putin.\n\n32:16.900 --> 32:20.020\n I wanted to know what they thought,\n\n32:20.020 --> 32:24.520\n because we couldn't get the information war\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:26.340\n that the United States was fighting against Russia.\n\n32:26.340 --> 32:28.020\n It was in evidence back then.\n\n32:28.020 --> 32:29.380\n It was full out.\n\n32:29.380 --> 32:33.500\n The condemnation of Russia on all fronts.\n\n32:33.500 --> 32:36.820\n I never saw a positive article about Putin.\n\n32:36.820 --> 32:38.420\n Although when I traveled in the world,\n\n32:38.420 --> 32:40.700\n and I traveled a lot doing documentaries,\n\n32:40.700 --> 32:44.180\n it was very clear in the Middle East, in Africa, in Asia,\n\n32:44.180 --> 32:45.740\n there was respect for him.\n\n32:45.740 --> 32:48.380\n That he was a man who was getting his job done\n\n32:48.380 --> 32:50.100\n in the interest of Russia.\n\n32:50.100 --> 32:53.580\n He was, as I said in the documentary, a son of Russia.\n\n32:53.580 --> 32:58.020\n Very much so, in the positive sense, a son of Russia.\n\n32:58.020 --> 33:02.100\n Not that he's out there trying to destroy\n\n33:02.100 --> 33:05.340\n the interests of other countries, no.\n\n33:05.340 --> 33:09.020\n That he was out there to promote the interests of Russia,\n\n33:09.020 --> 33:11.060\n but at the same time, keep a balance.\n\n33:11.060 --> 33:14.140\n Keep the world into a harmony.\n\n33:14.140 --> 33:15.980\n This has always been his picture.\n\n33:15.980 --> 33:17.880\n Peace was always his idea.\n\n33:17.880 --> 33:19.780\n In other words, he always referred to the United States\n\n33:19.780 --> 33:22.740\n in all these interviews as our partners.\n\n33:22.740 --> 33:24.320\n And I said, will you stop using that word?\n\n33:24.320 --> 33:25.160\n They're not.\n\n33:26.580 --> 33:28.380\n And he was a little bit slow in waking up\n\n33:28.380 --> 33:31.140\n to what the United States was doing.\n\n33:31.140 --> 33:34.460\n Well, that said, he's one of the most powerful men\n\n33:34.460 --> 33:35.940\n in the world.\n\n33:35.940 --> 33:37.980\n He was at that time.\n\n33:37.980 --> 33:40.840\n And let me ask you the human question.\n\n33:42.020 --> 33:44.440\n As the old adage goes, power corrupts\n\n33:44.440 --> 33:47.260\n and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\n33:47.260 --> 33:52.260\n Did you see any corroding effects of power on the man?\n\n33:52.920 --> 33:55.500\n Forget the political leader, on just the human being\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:59.420\n that carries that power on his shoulders for so many years.\n\n33:59.420 --> 34:03.660\n Keep in mind that he's been, unlike most modern leaders,\n\n34:03.660 --> 34:06.220\n he's been in office off and on,\n\n34:06.220 --> 34:08.860\n because Medvedev was president\n\n34:08.860 --> 34:12.740\n and he was not literally in charge.\n\n34:12.740 --> 34:17.060\n He took another appointment at that point,\n\n34:17.060 --> 34:18.860\n but he was still very much involved.\n\n34:18.860 --> 34:20.540\n But for 20 years, more or less,\n\n34:20.540 --> 34:24.580\n he's been at the administrator of the state,\n\n34:24.580 --> 34:26.580\n the protector of the state.\n\n34:26.580 --> 34:29.780\n And he's apparently done a good enough job\n\n34:29.780 --> 34:32.060\n that the Russian people have kept him there.\n\n34:32.060 --> 34:34.020\n Because contrary to what many people think,\n\n34:34.020 --> 34:37.460\n I really believe that if the Russian people didn't want him,\n\n34:37.460 --> 34:39.180\n he would be out.\n\n34:39.180 --> 34:40.260\n I firmly believe that.\n\n34:40.260 --> 34:42.700\n I don't think you can go against the will of the people.\n\n34:42.700 --> 34:44.900\n Now, it expresses itself in many ways,\n\n34:44.900 --> 34:46.520\n at the ballot box and so forth,\n\n34:46.520 --> 34:47.980\n but also in other ways in Russia.\n\n34:47.980 --> 34:51.420\n There's a strong currents of opinion.\n\n34:51.420 --> 34:55.580\n So contrary to what the position of him as a dictator,\n\n34:55.580 --> 34:58.300\n he wouldn't last if he was unpopular, number one.\n\n34:58.300 --> 35:01.860\n Number two, Russia is much more divided than people know.\n\n35:01.860 --> 35:03.500\n There's other factors in Russia.\n\n35:04.580 --> 35:07.820\n There are always tensions around the Kremlin,\n\n35:07.820 --> 35:09.940\n who has power, who doesn't have power.\n\n35:09.940 --> 35:12.680\n That's been going on for 100 years.\n\n35:12.680 --> 35:17.420\n But the factions in Russia are very much there.\n\n35:17.420 --> 35:22.140\n So when people refer to Russia as Putin, they're mistaken.\n\n35:22.140 --> 35:25.040\n And they do this regularly in the New York papers\n\n35:25.040 --> 35:25.880\n and all this.\n\n35:25.880 --> 35:28.020\n They say, Putin did this, Putin did that,\n\n35:28.020 --> 35:31.100\n Putin's doing that, but it's Russia that's doing it.\n\n35:31.100 --> 35:34.220\n And that's what, there's a distinction there that I,\n\n35:34.220 --> 35:35.060\n it's changed.\n\n35:35.060 --> 35:37.780\n In the old days, I would read about Khrushchev,\n\n35:37.780 --> 35:40.040\n but it was never Khrushchev personally.\n\n35:40.040 --> 35:41.840\n It was about the Soviet Union.\n\n35:43.100 --> 35:45.020\n There was respect for a country.\n\n35:45.020 --> 35:48.040\n And now when it started to get personal with Putin,\n\n35:48.860 --> 35:53.360\n it changed and our thinking changed in a negative way.\n\n35:53.360 --> 35:56.180\n We no longer respected it as a country,\n\n35:56.180 --> 35:57.380\n we were seeing it as a man.\n\n35:57.380 --> 36:00.100\n And the man we had trashed repeatedly,\n\n36:00.100 --> 36:02.780\n repeatedly as a poisoner, as a murderer,\n\n36:02.780 --> 36:04.900\n and none of which has ever been proven,\n\n36:04.900 --> 36:07.100\n but which has always been repeated and repeated\n\n36:07.100 --> 36:10.900\n to the point at which it becomes like an Orwell mantra.\n\n36:10.900 --> 36:13.740\n It becomes like, he is of course a bad guy.\n\n36:13.740 --> 36:17.280\n Can I just ask you, as a great filmmaker,\n\n36:17.280 --> 36:20.340\n as a human being, what was it like talking\n\n36:20.340 --> 36:23.060\n to one of the most powerful men in the world?\n\n36:23.060 --> 36:25.260\n For honestly, and I'm not naive,\n\n36:25.260 --> 36:27.660\n I've talked to a lot of powerful people.\n\n36:28.980 --> 36:30.900\n In the movie business, there are powerful people\n\n36:30.900 --> 36:32.580\n and many of them are corrupted.\n\n36:32.580 --> 36:34.100\n I've talked to many people in my life.\n\n36:34.100 --> 36:38.060\n I've been in the military, I've seen, I've had other jobs.\n\n36:38.060 --> 36:40.420\n I have to say, I found him to be a human being.\n\n36:40.420 --> 36:43.620\n I just found him to be reasonable, calm.\n\n36:44.500 --> 36:45.980\n I never saw him lose his temper.\n\n36:45.980 --> 36:48.980\n And I mean, you have to understand that most people,\n\n36:48.980 --> 36:51.820\n most people in the Western way of doing business\n\n36:51.820 --> 36:53.100\n get emotional.\n\n36:53.100 --> 36:54.220\n I don't see that.\n\n36:54.220 --> 36:56.700\n I saw him as a balanced man,\n\n36:56.700 --> 36:59.020\n as a man who had studied this like you have.\n\n36:59.020 --> 37:00.860\n There's a calmness to you.\n\n37:00.860 --> 37:02.420\n It comes from studying the world\n\n37:02.420 --> 37:05.360\n and having a rational response to it.\n\n37:06.420 --> 37:07.980\n It's interesting, his two daughters,\n\n37:07.980 --> 37:09.580\n one of them is very scientific\n\n37:09.580 --> 37:12.500\n and the other one's doing very well in another profession,\n\n37:12.500 --> 37:15.360\n but they're a thinking family.\n\n37:15.360 --> 37:17.000\n His wife too was.\n\n37:18.180 --> 37:19.340\n I can't talk for the new wife\n\n37:19.340 --> 37:20.380\n because I don't know about it,\n\n37:20.380 --> 37:23.660\n but he kept his family with great respect.\n\n37:23.660 --> 37:26.180\n He's raised his daughter's right.\n\n37:26.180 --> 37:28.220\n He served Yeltsin the way he looked at it.\n\n37:28.220 --> 37:32.780\n He served Yeltsin well, and he never trashed Yeltsin.\n\n37:32.780 --> 37:34.100\n Certainly a lot of people did,\n\n37:34.100 --> 37:38.020\n but I asked him repeatedly was he an alcoholic,\n\n37:38.020 --> 37:40.220\n this or that, but he wouldn't even go that far.\n\n37:40.220 --> 37:41.900\n Just respect.\n\n37:41.900 --> 37:46.900\n And this man, Yeltsin, was in many ways ridiculed\n\n37:46.900 --> 37:51.900\n by the Russians, and he turned over the power\n\n37:52.020 --> 37:53.780\n because he felt like he was overwhelmed.\n\n37:53.780 --> 37:56.160\n He turned over the power to this man because why?\n\n37:56.160 --> 37:57.860\n How many people had he fired before him?\n\n37:57.860 --> 38:00.460\n Several, several prime ministers, this, that.\n\n38:00.460 --> 38:03.260\n Why did he turn power over to Mr. Putin?\n\n38:03.260 --> 38:07.700\n Because he respected him for his work ethic\n\n38:07.700 --> 38:10.860\n and his balance, his maturity.\n\n38:10.860 --> 38:12.860\n And that's what I can say is I saw in him.\n\n38:12.860 --> 38:17.860\n A poor person from a poor family who worked his way up\n\n38:18.740 --> 38:21.780\n through the KGB, Americans keep saying he's a KGB agent,\n\n38:21.780 --> 38:25.980\n but it's like saying George Bush was a CIA agent,\n\n38:25.980 --> 38:28.860\n but he became, you grow, you grow in your life.\n\n38:28.860 --> 38:33.060\n And he went from the KGB to this technocratic position.\n\n38:33.060 --> 38:38.060\n He dealt with many problems, including the Chechnyan War,\n\n38:38.100 --> 38:40.500\n which is a very difficult situation,\n\n38:40.500 --> 38:43.100\n as well as the Russian submarine problem.\n\n38:43.100 --> 38:44.940\n Several things happened early in his,\n\n38:44.940 --> 38:47.900\n that gave him a lot of experience,\n\n38:47.900 --> 38:49.960\n and he handled them all pretty well.\n\n38:49.960 --> 38:52.100\n Do you think he was an honest man?\n\n38:52.100 --> 38:52.920\n I do.\n\n38:52.920 --> 38:54.900\n Now, of course, the question of money,\n\n38:54.900 --> 38:57.300\n the charge is that he's the richest man in the world,\n\n38:57.300 --> 39:00.420\n or ludicrous, certainly doesn't live like it\n\n39:00.420 --> 39:01.340\n or act like it.\n\n39:01.340 --> 39:03.540\n If you're rich, I've been around\n\n39:03.540 --> 39:05.140\n a lot of rich people in my life.\n\n39:05.140 --> 39:06.020\n You'd probably have, too.\n\n39:06.020 --> 39:07.500\n In America, you run into them.\n\n39:07.500 --> 39:08.740\n So many of them are arrogant.\n\n39:08.740 --> 39:11.380\n I'm actually good friends now\n\n39:11.380 --> 39:13.140\n with the richest man in the world.\n\n39:13.140 --> 39:16.820\n Of course, I saw your interview with Mr. Musk,\n\n39:16.820 --> 39:18.180\n who I appreciate.\n\n39:18.180 --> 39:19.680\n At least he speaks freely.\n\n39:21.480 --> 39:23.780\n I'm positive about him owning Twitter,\n\n39:23.780 --> 39:27.100\n because Twitter has become censorship city,\n\n39:27.100 --> 39:29.100\n as has all the major tech.\n\n39:29.100 --> 39:30.860\n I mean, the censorship that we are now seeing\n\n39:30.860 --> 39:34.620\n in the United States is so unAmerican and shocking to me.\n\n39:34.620 --> 39:36.940\n And he is a resistance to that, that is true.\n\n39:36.940 --> 39:38.440\n Yeah, I like Musk for that.\n\n39:38.440 --> 39:39.340\n Just for that only.\n\n39:39.340 --> 39:43.380\n But I also appreciate him, his adventuresome,\n\n39:43.380 --> 39:47.680\n his nature and his desire to explore the world\n\n39:47.680 --> 39:49.020\n and to ask questions.\n\n39:49.020 --> 39:54.020\n Yeah, there's certain ways you sound when you speak freely.\n\n39:54.060 --> 39:56.260\n There's certain ways you sound,\n\n39:56.260 --> 39:58.540\n a man sounds when he speaks freely,\n\n39:58.540 --> 40:00.420\n and he speaks freely.\n\n40:00.420 --> 40:02.500\n And it's refreshing.\n\n40:02.500 --> 40:05.140\n No matter whether you're rich or not, it doesn't matter.\n\n40:05.140 --> 40:06.940\n When you speak freely, it's a beautiful thing.\n\n40:06.940 --> 40:10.180\n Actually, Musk, in a major point\n\n40:10.180 --> 40:12.020\n on going back to nuclear energy,\n\n40:12.020 --> 40:15.580\n he never believed in it at first, apparently.\n\n40:15.580 --> 40:17.180\n He was going for batteries, right?\n\n40:17.180 --> 40:19.280\n And he put a lot of money into batteries.\n\n40:19.280 --> 40:20.700\n He made them bigger and bigger batteries.\n\n40:20.700 --> 40:23.300\n But it just, as Bill Gates has said,\n\n40:23.300 --> 40:25.960\n it's just, it's not gonna get us there.\n\n40:25.960 --> 40:28.220\n And now I think Musk is on another path.\n\n40:28.220 --> 40:29.900\n He understands the need for nuclear.\n\n40:29.900 --> 40:31.620\n Yeah, he's a supporter of nuclear.\n\n40:33.620 --> 40:35.060\n We're jumping around.\n\n40:35.060 --> 40:37.900\n Putin never asked for one thing, never.\n\n40:37.900 --> 40:39.940\n It was an interview, it was free form.\n\n40:39.940 --> 40:41.580\n Ask anything you want.\n\n40:41.580 --> 40:43.480\n No restrictions, no rules.\n\n40:44.780 --> 40:46.140\n As with Castro, frankly,\n\n40:46.140 --> 40:47.820\n Castro did the same thing as did Chavez.\n\n40:47.820 --> 40:50.660\n So I've had good luck in interviewing free ranging subjects,\n\n40:50.660 --> 40:52.380\n people willing to express themselves.\n\n40:52.380 --> 40:57.300\n He's much more guarded than Castro or Chavez,\n\n40:57.300 --> 41:00.200\n because as you know, he's setting government policy\n\n41:00.200 --> 41:01.040\n when he speaks.\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:03.940\n Anything he says is gonna be taken out of context.\n\n41:03.940 --> 41:06.920\n But there was no restrictions on what to talk about,\n\n41:06.920 --> 41:07.760\n none of that.\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:10.920\n Nor any desire to see anything before we published it.\n\n41:10.920 --> 41:13.620\n No need to check it with him.\n\n41:14.460 --> 41:17.780\n It was a completely.\n\n41:17.780 --> 41:19.980\n Do you think he watched the final product?\n\n41:19.980 --> 41:23.220\n Yes, I do, but I don't think he made judgments on it.\n\n41:23.220 --> 41:25.280\n I think he was pleased.\n\n41:25.280 --> 41:26.300\n He doesn't go either way.\n\n41:26.300 --> 41:28.460\n You see, he's pleased.\n\n41:28.460 --> 41:30.940\n I mean, it went well and he's happy for us.\n\n41:30.940 --> 41:33.340\n But I don't think he had great enthusiasm\n\n41:33.340 --> 41:34.820\n expressed it to me.\n\n41:34.820 --> 41:35.740\n He trusted me.\n\n41:35.740 --> 41:38.100\n And you can see the way he dealt with me each time.\n\n41:38.100 --> 41:41.140\n He warmed up to me four times.\n\n41:41.140 --> 41:44.300\n The first time I might've been a little stiff.\n\n41:44.300 --> 41:47.180\n You're asking, you don't know who you're dealing with\n\n41:47.180 --> 41:48.020\n and so forth.\n\n41:48.020 --> 41:49.540\n I understand that.\n\n41:49.540 --> 41:51.020\n But he's used to it now.\n\n41:51.020 --> 41:53.380\n He's done a lot of press.\n\n41:53.380 --> 41:55.500\n The worst press he's done, frankly,\n\n41:55.500 --> 41:57.340\n has been the American press.\n\n41:57.340 --> 41:59.220\n And not because of his fault,\n\n41:59.220 --> 42:01.420\n but because of the way they have treated him.\n\n42:01.420 --> 42:04.300\n If you look at the interviews, they're awful.\n\n42:04.300 --> 42:06.820\n First of all, I noticed one thing as a filmmaker,\n\n42:06.820 --> 42:09.020\n right away, they use an overdub.\n\n42:09.020 --> 42:11.540\n They put a Russian speaker for everything he says,\n\n42:11.540 --> 42:12.900\n who's much harsher.\n\n42:12.900 --> 42:15.140\n He speaks Russian in a much harsher manner\n\n42:15.140 --> 42:16.500\n than actually Putin does.\n\n42:17.420 --> 42:20.340\n On my interview, I left him in his original language\n\n42:20.340 --> 42:22.500\n with translator, and I think that's important\n\n42:22.500 --> 42:26.400\n because he expresses himself very clearly and calmly.\n\n42:27.620 --> 42:29.340\n When you listen to the American broadcast,\n\n42:29.340 --> 42:30.940\n it's a belligerent person who looks like\n\n42:30.940 --> 42:32.980\n he's about to bang his shoe on the table.\n\n42:33.940 --> 42:37.280\n And secondly, the questions are highly aggressive\n\n42:37.280 --> 42:38.120\n from the beginning.\n\n42:38.120 --> 42:41.900\n There's no sense of rapport, there's no sense of,\n\n42:41.900 --> 42:44.640\n well, it's why, Mr. Putin, did you poison this person?\n\n42:44.640 --> 42:46.860\n Why, Mr. Putin, did you kill this person?\n\n42:46.860 --> 42:47.860\n Why are you a murderer?\n\n42:47.860 --> 42:52.240\n I mean, it's blunt, blunt negative television.\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:53.960\n Yeah, it's not just aggressive.\n\n42:53.960 --> 42:56.940\n So I obviously speak Russian,\n\n42:56.940 --> 43:00.640\n so I get to appreciate both the original and the translation.\n\n43:00.640 --> 43:04.880\n And it's not just aggressive, it's very shallow.\n\n43:04.880 --> 43:06.860\n They're not looking to understand.\n\n43:06.860 --> 43:09.460\n To me, aggression is okay if that's the way\n\n43:09.460 --> 43:12.220\n you wanna approach it, but it should be,\n\n43:12.220 --> 43:15.580\n there should be underlying kind of empathy\n\n43:15.580 --> 43:19.140\n for another human being in order to be able to understand.\n\n43:19.140 --> 43:23.460\n And so some of the worst interviews I've ever listened to\n\n43:23.460 --> 43:25.700\n is by American press of Vladimir Putin.\n\n43:25.700 --> 43:29.580\n So NBC and all those kinds of organizations,\n\n43:29.580 --> 43:30.980\n it's very painful to watch.\n\n43:32.100 --> 43:34.060\n And you saw the reception to the Putin interviews\n\n43:34.060 --> 43:37.380\n in America was hostile without seeing it.\n\n43:37.380 --> 43:41.460\n So many people criticized my series\n\n43:41.460 --> 43:43.080\n without having seen it.\n\n43:43.080 --> 43:45.540\n Even, I went on a show, a television show\n\n43:45.540 --> 43:47.660\n with this famous coal bearer.\n\n43:47.660 --> 43:49.700\n You know, he's very famous in America.\n\n43:49.700 --> 43:51.720\n And I was shocked on the show to find out\n\n43:51.720 --> 43:53.860\n that he hadn't seen anything of the four hours.\n\n43:53.860 --> 43:56.140\n He was just attacking Putin.\n\n43:56.140 --> 43:58.660\n And he threw me, I was complicit,\n\n43:58.660 --> 44:01.500\n therefore I was a Putin supporter.\n\n44:01.500 --> 44:03.940\n And the show was a disaster.\n\n44:03.940 --> 44:05.980\n It's one of my worst television shows.\n\n44:05.980 --> 44:10.660\n I actually, I had to just shut up and get off the air.\n\n44:10.660 --> 44:13.780\n I mean, at some point, it was embarrassing.\n\n44:13.780 --> 44:16.180\n Because the audience, too, was clapping for Kobe\n\n44:16.180 --> 44:17.340\n on anything he said.\n\n44:17.340 --> 44:20.100\n Well, as an interviewer in that situation,\n\n44:20.100 --> 44:23.300\n because between you and Vladimir Putin,\n\n44:23.300 --> 44:28.300\n there was camaraderie, there was joking, there was...\n\n44:28.660 --> 44:33.660\n Are you worried, do you put that into the calculation\n\n44:34.020 --> 44:37.660\n when you're making a film with somebody\n\n44:37.660 --> 44:41.780\n that could be lying to you, that could be evil?\n\n44:41.780 --> 44:43.980\n When you talk about Castro, you talk about,\n\n44:43.980 --> 44:48.780\n so are you worried about how charisma of a man\n\n44:48.780 --> 44:51.860\n across the table from you can...\n\n44:51.860 --> 44:53.580\n Do I take that into account?\n\n44:53.580 --> 44:55.300\n I absolutely take that into account.\n\n44:55.300 --> 44:58.820\n I mean, doing Castro, he's a wonderful speaker,\n\n44:58.820 --> 45:01.340\n he's charismatic, so is Chavez.\n\n45:01.340 --> 45:03.040\n Look at those interviews.\n\n45:03.040 --> 45:04.560\n I took it into account.\n\n45:04.560 --> 45:06.360\n But Putin doesn't play that game.\n\n45:06.360 --> 45:09.540\n He doesn't charm you, he doesn't try to overwhelm you\n\n45:09.540 --> 45:13.780\n with his bon ami at all.\n\n45:13.780 --> 45:15.620\n He just says, okay, ask your question,\n\n45:15.620 --> 45:17.180\n I'll give you my answer straight.\n\n45:17.180 --> 45:19.340\n Here it is, and he analyzes it.\n\n45:19.340 --> 45:20.580\n This is the history of NATO,\n\n45:20.580 --> 45:22.180\n this is the history of our relationship\n\n45:22.180 --> 45:23.460\n with the United States.\n\n45:23.460 --> 45:26.000\n How many times have we tried to talk to them\n\n45:26.000 --> 45:27.740\n about such and such and such and such,\n\n45:27.740 --> 45:29.980\n and each time, we get nowhere.\n\n45:29.980 --> 45:31.540\n In fact, it's a very...\n\n45:32.860 --> 45:35.460\n I would like to get along with the United States so much,\n\n45:35.460 --> 45:38.820\n he's saying it so clearly in all his words.\n\n45:38.820 --> 45:40.780\n So to play devil's advocate.\n\n45:40.780 --> 45:42.580\n But he's not making a big deal about it.\n\n45:42.580 --> 45:44.820\n But there is a charisma in the calmness.\n\n45:44.820 --> 45:45.780\n Yes, there is.\n\n45:45.780 --> 45:50.000\n So let's just calm everything down, it's simple facts.\n\n45:50.000 --> 45:55.000\n That you can call, so there's like the Hitler thing,\n\n45:56.340 --> 46:00.260\n which is screaming, being very loud, charismatic,\n\n46:00.260 --> 46:02.100\n strong message and so on.\n\n46:02.100 --> 46:03.500\n And then there's a Putin style,\n\n46:03.500 --> 46:04.620\n I'm not comparing those two,\n\n46:04.620 --> 46:07.860\n there's the Putin style communication of calmness.\n\n46:07.860 --> 46:10.500\n And that, at least to me, my personality,\n\n46:10.500 --> 46:12.220\n that can be very captivating,\n\n46:12.220 --> 46:15.220\n is bringing everything down, the facts are simple.\n\n46:15.220 --> 46:16.860\n But then when you say the facts are simple,\n\n46:16.860 --> 46:18.420\n you can now start lying.\n\n46:18.420 --> 46:21.220\n And you don't know what's true and what's lies.\n\n46:21.220 --> 46:23.180\n It behooves you to do some research.\n\n46:23.180 --> 46:24.020\n Yes.\n\n46:24.020 --> 46:26.260\n And frankly, when it comes to research,\n\n46:26.260 --> 46:27.100\n you're gonna have a problem.\n\n46:27.100 --> 46:30.060\n Because if you go to the Americanized versions\n\n46:30.060 --> 46:33.540\n of Russian history, you're gonna run into a problem.\n\n46:33.540 --> 46:35.680\n And that includes even Wikipedia.\n\n46:35.680 --> 46:37.140\n They will tell you things\n\n46:37.140 --> 46:39.580\n that are just not factually supported.\n\n46:39.580 --> 46:42.540\n So it was a problem in terms of,\n\n46:42.540 --> 46:45.060\n if you read all the books in the American library\n\n46:45.060 --> 46:48.340\n about Putin, there's nothing positive about it.\n\n46:48.340 --> 46:49.840\n They're awful, they're awful.\n\n46:49.840 --> 46:52.680\n And a lot of them, I had a good relationship\n\n46:52.680 --> 46:54.140\n with Professor Stephen Cohen,\n\n46:54.140 --> 46:56.820\n who's the most, I think, one of the most informed men\n\n46:56.820 --> 46:59.940\n on Russia, he'd done a lot of research all his life.\n\n46:59.940 --> 47:02.700\n And knew Gorbachev very well.\n\n47:02.700 --> 47:07.180\n And was very analytical about all these situations\n\n47:07.180 --> 47:11.940\n that happened before his death in 2019.\n\n47:11.940 --> 47:13.560\n I'm not quite sure when Stephen died,\n\n47:13.560 --> 47:15.060\n but I knew him well.\n\n47:15.060 --> 47:20.060\n And he gave me the best information I could get.\n\n47:20.140 --> 47:22.360\n I would go to Stephen and I'd say,\n\n47:22.360 --> 47:24.220\n I'm confused here, tell me the history\n\n47:24.220 --> 47:27.100\n of this accusation of poisoning against this person\n\n47:27.100 --> 47:27.940\n and so forth.\n\n47:27.940 --> 47:30.620\n And he'd explain it to me in, I think,\n\n47:30.620 --> 47:32.820\n the clearest ways that I understood.\n\n47:32.820 --> 47:34.180\n And he said to me once, he said,\n\n47:34.180 --> 47:35.780\n most of these people who go to Russia\n\n47:35.780 --> 47:38.580\n and write this stuff about Putin are going off internet.\n\n47:38.580 --> 47:40.660\n The internet has really been a source\n\n47:40.660 --> 47:42.440\n of a lot of fractured facts here.\n\n47:42.440 --> 47:44.760\n He said, pure analysis.\n\n47:44.760 --> 47:46.880\n You have to go back to the texts,\n\n47:46.880 --> 47:50.440\n all the documents, and to really fully understand.\n\n47:50.440 --> 47:52.760\n But he spoke Russian.\n\n47:54.040 --> 47:59.040\n And his wife and him, Katerina Vanhoovle,\n\n47:59.080 --> 48:03.440\n who's an editor, publisher of The Nation magazine,\n\n48:03.440 --> 48:06.280\n would go to Russia several times a year\n\n48:06.280 --> 48:08.400\n and talk to their friend Gorbachev.\n\n48:08.400 --> 48:10.440\n And Gorbachev's an interesting character.\n\n48:10.440 --> 48:12.440\n I talked to him, interviewed him,\n\n48:12.440 --> 48:14.400\n not interviewed him, but talked to him at length,\n\n48:14.400 --> 48:16.360\n and I like him very much.\n\n48:16.360 --> 48:19.160\n And I saw the divide, as you saw in the Putin interviews,\n\n48:19.160 --> 48:20.840\n between Gorbachev and Putin.\n\n48:20.840 --> 48:23.480\n Early on in the interviews, you sense Putin\n\n48:23.480 --> 48:25.440\n doesn't particularly care for Gorbachev\n\n48:25.440 --> 48:26.980\n because in his point of view,\n\n48:26.980 --> 48:29.400\n he screwed up the administration of Russia\n\n48:29.400 --> 48:32.400\n and is responsible for so much of the disaster\n\n48:32.400 --> 48:35.000\n of leaving all those people outside the Soviet Union.\n\n48:36.200 --> 48:39.400\n So these are problems that continue into the future.\n\n48:39.400 --> 48:44.300\n But they see each other at the,\n\n48:44.300 --> 48:48.500\n or he knows he's there at the May Day Parade, we filmed,\n\n48:48.500 --> 48:52.800\n and his attitude is funny, it's very human.\n\n48:53.880 --> 48:57.040\n He says, you know, he's welcome, he's got his pension,\n\n48:57.040 --> 48:59.760\n he's a pensioneer, he's done his duty.\n\n48:59.760 --> 49:04.720\n There's no animus towards him.\n\n49:04.720 --> 49:07.000\n Even when Gorbachev, in the early days,\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.680\n as you remember, criticized for his manners in terms\n\n49:09.680 --> 49:14.680\n of democracy, but I don't know that that becomes a quarrel.\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:18.840\n But frankly, by the end of the situation,\n\n49:18.840 --> 49:21.840\n it's very clear that Gorbachev has now moved closer\n\n49:21.840 --> 49:23.860\n and closer to the, says that Russia is now\n\n49:23.860 --> 49:24.920\n really under attack.\n\n49:24.920 --> 49:28.280\n This is, he sees where the United States\n\n49:28.280 --> 49:31.840\n has made a concerted effort to undermine Putin.\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:35.400\n And he's repeated this several times about Ukraine.\n\n49:35.400 --> 49:37.280\n I think you've seen what he said.\n\n49:37.280 --> 49:39.000\n You can quote it.\n\n49:39.000 --> 49:42.040\n And Gorbachev is, we have no respect for Gorbachev even,\n\n49:42.040 --> 49:43.520\n even at this juncture.\n\n49:43.520 --> 49:46.480\n When can you see Gorbachev's ideas printed\n\n49:46.480 --> 49:48.160\n in most American newspapers?\n\n49:48.160 --> 49:52.120\n Very rarely, very rarely, and recently not at all.\n\n49:52.120 --> 49:54.600\n So Gorbachev, who was our hero back in,\n\n49:54.600 --> 49:58.120\n an American hero back in the 1980s,\n\n49:58.120 --> 50:00.580\n has now been condemned to the garbage can,\n\n50:00.580 --> 50:01.780\n so to speak, of history.\n\n50:01.780 --> 50:05.380\n Well, in this complicated geopolitical picture\n\n50:05.380 --> 50:08.440\n you just outlined, can we talk about\n\n50:08.440 --> 50:12.180\n the recent invasion of Ukraine?\n\n50:12.180 --> 50:17.180\n So you wrote on Facebook a pretty eloquent analysis,\n\n50:17.500 --> 50:21.620\n I think on March 3rd.\n\n50:22.900 --> 50:26.100\n Let me just read a small section of that,\n\n50:26.100 --> 50:28.780\n just to give context, and maybe we can talk\n\n50:28.780 --> 50:31.880\n a little bit more about both Russia and the man Putin.\n\n50:33.140 --> 50:35.340\n You wrote, although the United States\n\n50:35.340 --> 50:38.020\n has many wars of aggression on its conscience,\n\n50:38.020 --> 50:41.780\n it doesn't justify Mr. Putin's aggression in Ukraine.\n\n50:41.780 --> 50:44.500\n A dozen wrongs don't make a right.\n\n50:44.500 --> 50:46.460\n Russia was wrong to invade.\n\n50:46.460 --> 50:48.580\n It has made too many mistakes.\n\n50:48.580 --> 50:51.440\n One, underestimating Ukraine resistance.\n\n50:51.440 --> 50:54.100\n Two, overestimating the military ability\n\n50:54.100 --> 50:55.940\n to achieve its objective.\n\n50:55.940 --> 50:58.480\n Three, underestimating Europe's reaction,\n\n50:58.480 --> 51:01.760\n especially Germany, upping its military contribution\n\n51:01.760 --> 51:04.980\n to NATO, which they've resisted for some 20 years.\n\n51:04.980 --> 51:07.580\n Even Switzerland has joined the cause.\n\n51:07.580 --> 51:11.540\n Russia will be more isolated than ever from the West.\n\n51:11.540 --> 51:15.100\n Four, underestimating the enhanced power of NATO,\n\n51:15.100 --> 51:18.020\n which will now put more pressure on Russia's borders.\n\n51:18.020 --> 51:22.000\n Five, probably putting Ukraine into NATO.\n\n51:22.000 --> 51:25.820\n Six, underestimating the damage to its own economy,\n\n51:25.820 --> 51:28.220\n and certainly creating more internal resistance\n\n51:28.220 --> 51:29.360\n in Russia.\n\n51:29.360 --> 51:32.520\n Seven, creating a major readjustment of power\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:34.800\n in its oligarch class.\n\n51:34.800 --> 51:39.800\n Eight, putting cluster and vacuum bombs into play.\n\n51:39.800 --> 51:43.300\n Nine, and underestimating the power\n\n51:43.300 --> 51:45.340\n of social media worldwide.\n\n51:45.340 --> 51:49.700\n And you go on for a while giving a much broader picture\n\n51:51.020 --> 51:53.820\n of the history and the geopolitics of all of this.\n\n51:53.820 --> 51:58.820\n So now, a little bit later, two months later,\n\n52:01.020 --> 52:05.140\n what are your thoughts about the invasion of Ukraine?\n\n52:05.140 --> 52:08.660\n Well, it's very hard to be honest in this regard\n\n52:08.660 --> 52:13.660\n because the West has brought down a curtain here\n\n52:13.900 --> 52:18.380\n and anyone who questions the invasion of Ukraine\n\n52:18.380 --> 52:23.380\n and its consequences is an enemy of the people.\n\n52:24.340 --> 52:26.780\n It's become so difficult.\n\n52:26.780 --> 52:31.780\n I've never seen in my lifetime ever such a wall\n\n52:33.140 --> 52:38.140\n of propaganda as I've seen in the West.\n\n52:38.580 --> 52:39.860\n And that includes France too\n\n52:39.860 --> 52:42.020\n because I was there recently and England.\n\n52:42.020 --> 52:46.420\n England is of course really vociferous.\n\n52:46.420 --> 52:50.220\n It's shocking to me how quickly Europe moved\n\n52:50.220 --> 52:52.460\n in this direction and that includes Germany.\n\n52:52.460 --> 52:55.020\n I have German friends who express to me their shock\n\n52:55.020 --> 52:56.280\n over Ukraine.\n\n52:56.280 --> 52:58.100\n I have Italian friends, same thing.\n\n52:58.100 --> 53:01.740\n And Italy of course has been perhaps the most understanding\n\n53:01.740 --> 53:03.980\n and compassionate of countries.\n\n53:03.980 --> 53:08.020\n So it's quite evident that there's a united,\n\n53:09.060 --> 53:11.820\n and this attests to the power of the United States.\n\n53:11.820 --> 53:14.900\n And of course you have Finland and Svinland\n\n53:14.900 --> 53:17.660\n which has generally been reasonable jumping in,\n\n53:17.660 --> 53:20.640\n talking about joining NATO and Sweden too.\n\n53:21.860 --> 53:26.260\n Generally there's been some more restraint in Europe.\n\n53:26.260 --> 53:29.100\n That's what surprised me the most, Europe.\n\n53:29.100 --> 53:32.500\n How quickly they fell into this NATO basket\n\n53:33.420 --> 53:36.300\n which is very dangerous for Europe, very dangerous.\n\n53:36.300 --> 53:38.960\n This goes back to my idea what I was saying earlier\n\n53:38.960 --> 53:40.440\n about sovereignty.\n\n53:41.460 --> 53:44.400\n These countries don't really give me a sense\n\n53:44.400 --> 53:47.420\n that they have sovereignty over their own countries.\n\n53:47.420 --> 53:52.420\n They don't feel, to me I'm obviously intuition here\n\n53:52.420 --> 53:56.300\n is working, I just don't feel that they have freedom\n\n53:56.300 --> 53:59.620\n to say what they really think and they're scared to say it.\n\n53:59.620 --> 54:03.460\n When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003,\n\n54:05.040 --> 54:07.900\n I remember with great in a sense satisfaction\n\n54:07.900 --> 54:12.420\n that at least France, Chirac who I had not really\n\n54:12.420 --> 54:15.120\n known much about, stood up and said the United States\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:17.200\n we're not gonna join you in this expedition,\n\n54:17.200 --> 54:18.940\n basically into madness.\n\n54:18.940 --> 54:20.840\n Schroeder in Germany, same thing.\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:24.340\n Of course Putin condemned the invasion\n\n54:24.340 --> 54:27.260\n and Putin had been an ally of the United States\n\n54:27.260 --> 54:29.620\n since 9 11 if you remember correctly.\n\n54:29.620 --> 54:32.320\n And had called Bush and they were getting along.\n\n54:32.320 --> 54:36.060\n So even Putin said I won't go, don't go into Iraq.\n\n54:36.060 --> 54:38.940\n This is not the solution.\n\n54:38.940 --> 54:41.900\n He didn't oppose Afghanistan but he opposed Iraq.\n\n54:41.900 --> 54:46.720\n So Chirac and Schroeder stood for the old Europe.\n\n54:46.720 --> 54:49.920\n I remember de Gaulle, Charles de Gaulle,\n\n54:49.920 --> 54:52.420\n he was independent of the United States.\n\n54:52.420 --> 54:54.620\n Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of NATO\n\n54:54.620 --> 54:56.680\n because he saw the dangers of NATO,\n\n54:56.680 --> 54:59.940\n which is to say you have to fight an American war.\n\n54:59.940 --> 55:02.540\n When they say and they put nuclear weapons\n\n55:02.540 --> 55:05.020\n on your territory in England and France\n\n55:05.020 --> 55:09.020\n and Italy and Germany, when they do that,\n\n55:09.020 --> 55:12.060\n you're hitched to this superpower\n\n55:12.060 --> 55:14.980\n and you have no say in what they're gonna do.\n\n55:14.980 --> 55:18.140\n If they declare war and they use your territory,\n\n55:18.140 --> 55:20.820\n you're gonna be involved in a major conflict.\n\n55:20.820 --> 55:22.060\n I'm talking about sovereignty.\n\n55:22.060 --> 55:23.620\n Where is that sovereignty?\n\n55:23.620 --> 55:24.940\n They don't have it.\n\n55:24.940 --> 55:28.720\n And that has influenced their mindset for years now.\n\n55:28.720 --> 55:33.020\n Since 1940, well de Gaulle was the 60s.\n\n55:33.020 --> 55:34.940\n He actually reversed the whole flow\n\n55:34.940 --> 55:38.940\n and I think it was Sarkozy who put France\n\n55:38.940 --> 55:43.940\n back into NATO and now it's Macron.\n\n55:44.740 --> 55:47.320\n I hope because he was talking to Putin\n\n55:47.320 --> 55:50.400\n would at least have an independent viewpoint\n\n55:50.400 --> 55:53.860\n that could be helpful here, so he rolled it up.\n\n55:53.860 --> 55:55.360\n He may have told Putin something else,\n\n55:55.360 --> 55:57.000\n but within days he had rolled it up\n\n55:57.000 --> 55:59.580\n and gone along with the United States position,\n\n55:59.580 --> 56:03.140\n which was enforced by the United States in a very fierce way.\n\n56:03.140 --> 56:05.540\n The propaganda, as I say, I don't know how much time\n\n56:05.540 --> 56:08.300\n you spend in America, but it was vicious\n\n56:08.300 --> 56:10.300\n and everything was anti Russian.\n\n56:10.300 --> 56:11.940\n Russia were killing all these people,\n\n56:11.940 --> 56:16.940\n were shooting down civilians,\n\n56:17.100 --> 56:18.820\n although there was no proof of it.\n\n56:18.820 --> 56:20.780\n There was just, these are the accidents of war,\n\n56:20.780 --> 56:23.540\n but all of a sudden it was a campaign of criminality\n\n56:23.540 --> 56:25.380\n and they were talking about bringing Putin\n\n56:25.380 --> 56:27.700\n into war crime trial.\n\n56:27.700 --> 56:30.700\n Well, why didn't they talk like that when Iraq was going on\n\n56:30.700 --> 56:33.500\n and Bush was killing far more people?\n\n56:33.500 --> 56:35.260\n Or for that matter, why were they not talking\n\n56:35.260 --> 56:39.420\n about the killings in Donbass and Lugansk\n\n56:39.420 --> 56:44.420\n during that 2014 to 2022 period?\n\n56:45.300 --> 56:47.180\n That is what, it's a crime.\n\n56:47.180 --> 56:49.540\n There were so many people that were killed,\n\n56:49.540 --> 56:51.620\n many of them innocent, many of them innocent.\n\n56:51.620 --> 56:54.860\n What would be the way for Vladimir Putin\n\n56:54.860 --> 56:59.860\n to stop the killing in Donbass\n\n57:00.020 --> 57:02.460\n without the invasion of Ukraine?\n\n57:02.460 --> 57:04.460\n That's a very good question and I've asked that\n\n57:04.460 --> 57:06.460\n several times and I don't have the,\n\n57:06.460 --> 57:09.580\n I have not talked to him since about two years now.\n\n57:12.300 --> 57:13.380\n It's a very good question.\n\n57:13.380 --> 57:16.540\n What's the mistakes, what the human mistakes\n\n57:16.540 --> 57:18.340\n and the leadership mistakes made by Vladimir Putin?\n\n57:18.340 --> 57:19.180\n It's a very good question.\n\n57:19.180 --> 57:21.900\n You see, what the American press has not said\n\n57:21.900 --> 57:25.220\n and the Western press has not said is that on February 24,\n\n57:25.220 --> 57:28.660\n was it, that was, on that day when they invaded,\n\n57:28.660 --> 57:31.260\n the day before, if you check the logs\n\n57:31.260 --> 57:35.780\n of the European organization that was supervising,\n\n57:35.780 --> 57:37.820\n was in the field in Ukraine.\n\n57:37.820 --> 57:39.940\n These are neutral observers.\n\n57:39.940 --> 57:43.300\n They were seeing heavier and heavier artillery fire\n\n57:43.300 --> 57:48.300\n going into Donbass from the Ukrainian side.\n\n57:50.860 --> 57:55.540\n So they had, apparently, Ukraine had 110,000 troops\n\n57:55.540 --> 57:56.380\n on the border.\n\n57:56.380 --> 57:59.220\n They were about to invade Donbass, that was the plan.\n\n57:59.220 --> 58:00.740\n That's what I think.\n\n58:00.740 --> 58:05.580\n Russia, because of the buildup on the border of Donbass,\n\n58:05.580 --> 58:09.180\n brought 130, they say 130,000 troops\n\n58:09.180 --> 58:13.180\n to the area near Donbass, right?\n\n58:13.180 --> 58:15.820\n So you have buildup of forces on both sides,\n\n58:15.820 --> 58:18.180\n but you wouldn't know that from reading the press\n\n58:18.180 --> 58:19.020\n in the West.\n\n58:19.020 --> 58:21.900\n You'd believe that the Russians suddenly put all these men\n\n58:21.900 --> 58:26.900\n into the situation with the idea of invading Ukraine,\n\n58:26.980 --> 58:29.460\n not only Donbass, but invading all of Ukraine\n\n58:29.460 --> 58:33.460\n and getting rid of the, decapitating the government there,\n\n58:33.460 --> 58:34.780\n which is all assumption.\n\n58:34.780 --> 58:36.900\n We don't know what they would intend it to do.\n\n58:36.900 --> 58:40.220\n But you, at the time, as in a lot of people,\n\n58:40.220 --> 58:44.780\n thought that all the talk of the invasion,\n\n58:44.780 --> 58:48.460\n Russian invasion of Ukraine, is just propaganda.\n\n58:48.460 --> 58:49.300\n It's not gonna happen.\n\n58:49.300 --> 58:50.500\n It's very unlikely to happen.\n\n58:50.500 --> 58:52.300\n I think many of us thought that the United States\n\n58:52.300 --> 58:54.820\n is building this up into an invasion.\n\n58:54.820 --> 58:58.300\n In other words, that is the nature of false flag operations,\n\n58:58.300 --> 59:00.900\n when you create this propaganda.\n\n59:00.900 --> 59:01.820\n They are gonna invade.\n\n59:01.820 --> 59:02.780\n They are gonna invade.\n\n59:02.780 --> 59:05.620\n And then, when they invaded, the United States\n\n59:05.620 --> 59:07.500\n was completely ready, and all their allies\n\n59:07.500 --> 59:09.840\n were completely ready for the invasion, correct?\n\n59:09.840 --> 59:11.180\n So why did Putin do that?\n\n59:11.180 --> 59:14.100\n He fell into this, theoretically, into this trap\n\n59:14.100 --> 59:16.060\n set by the United States.\n\n59:16.060 --> 59:18.220\n Here you're telling all your allies across the board\n\n59:18.220 --> 59:19.900\n they're gonna invade.\n\n59:19.900 --> 59:21.280\n But you.\n\n59:21.280 --> 59:23.420\n Why do you think he did it?\n\n59:23.420 --> 59:27.020\n So here, is it madness, or is it common\n\n59:27.020 --> 59:29.500\n strategic calculation, perhaps?\n\n59:29.500 --> 59:31.540\n This one I cannot answer you faithfully,\n\n59:31.540 --> 59:34.700\n because, first of all, we don't know what he was told.\n\n59:34.700 --> 59:38.300\n If he was indeed getting the right intelligence estimates,\n\n59:38.300 --> 59:43.300\n from what I said earlier in that essay I wrote,\n\n59:44.220 --> 59:47.660\n you would think he was not well informed, perhaps,\n\n59:47.660 --> 59:51.620\n about the degree of cooperation he would get\n\n59:51.620 --> 59:56.620\n from the Ukrainian Russians in Ukraine.\n\n59:57.200 --> 59:59.380\n That would be one factor, that he wasn't,\n\n1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:03.360\n he didn't assess the operation correctly.\n\n1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:04.540\n Remember this.\n\n1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:09.540\n Mr. Putin has had this cancer, and I think he's licked it,\n\n1:00:09.780 --> 1:00:12.540\n but he's also been isolated because of COVID.\n\n1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:15.020\n And some people would argue that the isolation\n\n1:00:15.020 --> 1:00:18.800\n from normal activity, which he was meeting people\n\n1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:20.980\n face to face, but all of a sudden he was meeting people\n\n1:00:20.980 --> 1:00:23.940\n across the table 100 yards away, or whatever,\n\n1:00:23.940 --> 1:00:26.380\n 10 yards away, it was very hard.\n\n1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:30.180\n Perhaps he lost touch with, contact with people.\n\n1:00:30.180 --> 1:00:33.460\n So it's not just power, it's the very simple fact\n\n1:00:33.460 --> 1:00:34.300\n that you're just distant from humans.\n\n1:00:34.300 --> 1:00:36.500\n As I say, I'm speculating, I don't know.\n\n1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:40.580\n I see that, and I also, perhaps he thought in his mind\n\n1:00:40.580 --> 1:00:45.020\n that there would be a faster resolution\n\n1:00:45.020 --> 1:00:48.260\n that the Ukrainian, because the evidence had been\n\n1:00:48.260 --> 1:00:52.500\n that the Ukrainian Russians, the Ukrainian army\n\n1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:56.300\n had folded so many times, and that they were only backed up\n\n1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:57.840\n and they were stiffened by the resistance\n\n1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:02.380\n of the Nazi oriented Azov battalions.\n\n1:01:02.380 --> 1:01:04.260\n That was a factor, of course.\n\n1:01:04.260 --> 1:01:06.100\n And that is a big factor for the Russians\n\n1:01:06.100 --> 1:01:08.820\n because these people are very tough, they rush.\n\n1:01:08.820 --> 1:01:11.460\n See, what people don't understand is that Ukraine,\n\n1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:14.460\n since 2014, has been a terror state.\n\n1:01:14.460 --> 1:01:18.620\n They've been run, anytime a Ukrainian has expressed\n\n1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:23.620\n any understanding of the Russian Ukrainian position,\n\n1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.240\n they've been threatened by the state.\n\n1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:32.700\n From 2014 to 2022, there's been a set of hideous murders\n\n1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:34.200\n that people don't even know about in the West.\n\n1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:37.900\n Journalists, people who speak out, liberals,\n\n1:01:37.900 --> 1:01:40.980\n people who, I interviewed Viktor Medvedev,\n\n1:01:40.980 --> 1:01:43.660\n who they make out to be some kind of horrible person,\n\n1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:46.380\n but Medvedev was a very important figure\n\n1:01:46.380 --> 1:01:48.180\n in the administration of Khushma,\n\n1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:52.020\n the first Ukrainian Prime Minister in the 1990s,\n\n1:01:52.020 --> 1:01:54.260\n and he did a great job on the economy.\n\n1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:55.660\n He was a very thoughtful man.\n\n1:01:55.660 --> 1:01:58.260\n If you'll see my interview, it's called Ukraine Revealed.\n\n1:01:58.260 --> 1:02:00.620\n He's very thoughtful about the future of Ukraine.\n\n1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:02.660\n He doesn't want to go back and join Russia.\n\n1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.860\n He wants it to be an independent country.\n\n1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:07.740\n Ukraine is independent, and he wants it to be\n\n1:02:07.740 --> 1:02:10.760\n a functioning economic democracy, more or less,\n\n1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:13.900\n a democracy, if you can get that,\n\n1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:15.740\n that exists in a neutral state,\n\n1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.500\n a neutral state, which Ukraine used to be before 2014.\n\n1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:24.340\n It was neutral from 1991 to 2014, neutral, very important.\n\n1:02:25.740 --> 1:02:28.700\n Under Poroshenko, it just immediately went\n\n1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.740\n into an anti Soviet Cold War position\n\n1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:34.100\n as an ally of the United States,\n\n1:02:34.100 --> 1:02:39.100\n and my point was that it was a very dangerous place\n\n1:02:39.100 --> 1:02:39.940\n in Ukraine.\n\n1:02:39.940 --> 1:02:43.940\n People were being killed, death squads were out there.\n\n1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:47.540\n Medvedev, they stripped him of his television stations\n\n1:02:47.540 --> 1:02:50.620\n very suddenly, this is Zelensky, the new president.\n\n1:02:50.620 --> 1:02:54.460\n Zelensky was elected on a peace platform, remember that.\n\n1:02:54.460 --> 1:02:57.860\n 70% of the country was for him to make peace with Russia.\n\n1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:00.780\n Did he ever even try to make peace with Russia?\n\n1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:04.460\n Did he attend any of the Minsk Two agreements?\n\n1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:08.460\n Did he visit, did he pay any attention to the Minsk?\n\n1:03:08.460 --> 1:03:09.660\n Did he pay attention to Putin?\n\n1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:10.500\n Did he go to Russia?\n\n1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:11.900\n No, not at all.\n\n1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:14.580\n The moment he got into office, I'm convinced\n\n1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:19.580\n that the militant sector of the right sector parties\n\n1:03:22.780 --> 1:03:26.900\n of Ukraine let him know that you will not make a deal\n\n1:03:26.900 --> 1:03:30.140\n with Russia, there'll be no concessions to Russia.\n\n1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:31.220\n This is very dangerous.\n\n1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:34.520\n This is where this attitude that's very, very hostile\n\n1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:35.940\n to Russia has hurt us.\n\n1:03:35.940 --> 1:03:37.940\n The whole world is being hurt by this,\n\n1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:40.460\n and no one calls them out.\n\n1:03:40.460 --> 1:03:41.860\n No one calls them out.\n\n1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:45.180\n Zelensky backed off from his platform\n\n1:03:45.180 --> 1:03:47.540\n as running for president, and as president,\n\n1:03:47.540 --> 1:03:50.220\n has been ineffective, did nothing to promote it.\n\n1:03:50.220 --> 1:03:52.180\n On the contrary, went the other way,\n\n1:03:52.180 --> 1:03:56.700\n and seemed to support the Ukrainian aggression.\n\n1:03:56.700 --> 1:03:59.440\n Well, he found his support in this war.\n\n1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:02.820\n You've revealed through your work some of the most honest\n\n1:04:02.820 --> 1:04:04.800\n and dark aspects of war.\n\n1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:07.960\n Nevertheless, this is a war,\n\n1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:10.760\n and there's a humanitarian crisis.\n\n1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:15.760\n Millions of people, refugees, escape in Ukraine.\n\n1:04:16.040 --> 1:04:20.080\n What do you think about the human cost of this war,\n\n1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.640\n initiated by whoever, just as you write,\n\n1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:28.960\n whatever the context, whatever NATO, whatever pressure,\n\n1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:32.880\n as you wrote, Russia was wrong to invade.\n\n1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:36.400\n Okay, yeah, let's get back to that original question.\n\n1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:38.320\n You said, what was he thinking at that time?\n\n1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:39.920\n We never answered that.\n\n1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.920\n Now, by the way, among those people\n\n1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:48.440\n who've been ruined by this war,\n\n1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:53.120\n you have to include the 2014 to 2022 Ukrainian Russians.\n\n1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:58.120\n 14,000 were killed, not necessarily by,\n\n1:04:58.600 --> 1:05:01.080\n some of them by maybe accident and this and that,\n\n1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:02.800\n but certainly a large number of that\n\n1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:05.760\n is responsible to the Ukrainian military\n\n1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:09.120\n and the Nazi related battalions\n\n1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:11.880\n who have done a good job of death squatting that whole area.\n\n1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:13.920\n And remember, I did a film about Salvador.\n\n1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:16.000\n I know a little bit about death squads and how they work,\n\n1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.640\n and I know about paramilitaries,\n\n1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:19.920\n because in South America, they're all over the place.\n\n1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:22.800\n America supports, hates Venezuela,\n\n1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:23.920\n goes on about Venezuela,\n\n1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:25.840\n but do they tell you anything about Colombia,\n\n1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:27.040\n its next door neighbor?\n\n1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:30.440\n Colombia for years has been plagued by paramilitaries\n\n1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:32.600\n that are right wing, and the United States has said,\n\n1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:34.360\n nothing about them except occasionally,\n\n1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.040\n there's a newspaper report now.\n\n1:05:36.040 --> 1:05:39.720\n So this support of death squads by the United States\n\n1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:40.720\n is all over the world.\n\n1:05:40.720 --> 1:05:43.680\n It's not just in South America and Central America\n\n1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:46.440\n where we see plenty of evidence of it.\n\n1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:48.680\n It's here too, and this is what's horrible\n\n1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:51.960\n about this whole thing, this hypocrisy of America\n\n1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:55.000\n that they can support such evil, such evil.\n\n1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:58.680\n Now, going back to your larger question about,\n\n1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:02.000\n yeah, it's a terrible refugee disaster,\n\n1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.880\n but again, we have to get the numbers.\n\n1:06:03.880 --> 1:06:05.520\n Let's get the numbers and get the evidence,\n\n1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:09.080\n because I would ask you, I'm not sure at this point\n\n1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:13.440\n whether more civilians were killed before 2022 in Donbass\n\n1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:15.880\n than have been killed in this latest.\n\n1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.880\n So we can't talk about this without,\n\n1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:19.840\n we can't talk about the invasion of Ukraine\n\n1:06:19.840 --> 1:06:21.360\n without considering the full war\n\n1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.480\n between Russia and Ukraine since 2014.\n\n1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:26.520\n That's correct, absolutely,\n\n1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:29.560\n and take the toll on both sides,\n\n1:06:29.560 --> 1:06:32.320\n and you might be surprised by the result.\n\n1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:35.440\n I think the Russian military, of course, I'm not there,\n\n1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:37.520\n and I'm not, this is speculation.\n\n1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:39.240\n The Russian military has slowed down,\n\n1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:40.560\n and part of that reason\n\n1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:43.240\n is not to keep the civilian corridors open,\n\n1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.160\n and I think the Ukrainian military\n\n1:06:45.160 --> 1:06:47.640\n has made it more difficult on purpose,\n\n1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:49.240\n especially some of these battalions\n\n1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:51.920\n that are death squad battalions have gone out of their way\n\n1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:55.680\n to keep the civilians locked into these cities in danger\n\n1:06:55.680 --> 1:06:58.400\n because it's in their interest to do so.\n\n1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:01.840\n So there's no reason why Ukrainian military,\n\n1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:04.320\n who have killed Ukrainian civilians for years,\n\n1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:06.120\n would change their policies.\n\n1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:08.600\n They would have no compunctions about wiping out,\n\n1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:11.280\n for example, people with white armbands in Bukha.\n\n1:07:12.600 --> 1:07:16.440\n Okay, as to what Putin was thinking at the time,\n\n1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:18.640\n I wondered this, and I still do.\n\n1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:20.920\n I said, okay, so Putin can say,\n\n1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:24.880\n let's say the Ukrainian government\n\n1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:27.720\n wants to now invade Donbass.\n\n1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:30.600\n This is on February 23, and they have artillery,\n\n1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:32.000\n they're peppering the whole place.\n\n1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:35.600\n They're gonna go in, and they're gonna get Donbass back.\n\n1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:36.880\n What do you do?\n\n1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:39.680\n And you have Russian separatists,\n\n1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:42.440\n who are Russian Ukrainians who are on,\n\n1:07:42.440 --> 1:07:44.440\n who are gonna fight.\n\n1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:49.200\n How far do you go in supporting them?\n\n1:07:49.200 --> 1:07:51.640\n Can Russia at this point say, well, we can't help you.\n\n1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:54.080\n You have to get along, you have to somehow,\n\n1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:56.960\n you have to be absorbed by the Kiev,\n\n1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:58.080\n you're gonna be absorbed by them,\n\n1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:00.920\n and they're not gonna give you autonomy,\n\n1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:02.640\n and you have to live with them,\n\n1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:04.440\n and there's gonna be a price to pay.\n\n1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.800\n You could do that, and you could also say,\n\n1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:08.120\n well, we open our borders to Donbass.\n\n1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:10.360\n You can come in to our country, you can leave,\n\n1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:12.880\n and we will help you to resettle.\n\n1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:16.360\n And that would be a reasonable approach.\n\n1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.640\n So you take it to the next stage, as Putin's thinking.\n\n1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:20.640\n You take it to the next stage.\n\n1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:23.640\n You stall, it's harder for your,\n\n1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.040\n of course, there's this pressure on Putin\n\n1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.800\n from inside his own government to say,\n\n1:08:27.800 --> 1:08:28.640\n what are you gonna do?\n\n1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:29.840\n I mean, you can't do this,\n\n1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:31.640\n there's a lot of nationalists in Russia.\n\n1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:34.480\n They would certainly bring, it would be to his,\n\n1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:37.320\n they'd say Putin is weak, and that's the biggest rap\n\n1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:39.080\n you can ever give a Russian leader,\n\n1:08:39.080 --> 1:08:41.240\n is you're weak, you can't get anything done.\n\n1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:42.800\n So there would have been some damage,\n\n1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:44.840\n but let's say he goes with that, and he says,\n\n1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:47.840\n okay, we know what the United States intention is.\n\n1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:51.640\n It's to get rid of me, regime change,\n\n1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:53.240\n and to get another Yeltsin in.\n\n1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:54.640\n That's what they want.\n\n1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:55.880\n And they will go to any ends,\n\n1:08:55.880 --> 1:08:58.200\n they will destroy Ukraine if necessary,\n\n1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:00.480\n but they want regime change in Russia.\n\n1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:02.680\n And then after they do that, of course,\n\n1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:03.600\n they'll go after China,\n\n1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:06.240\n but that's the ultimate policy of the United States.\n\n1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:09.560\n This is a country that has no compunctions\n\n1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:11.400\n about going all the way,\n\n1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:14.680\n and it will use hypocrisy and all the news propaganda\n\n1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.360\n in the world to get what it wants.\n\n1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:17.760\n This is the equivalent, frankly,\n\n1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:22.760\n of Germany's goals in World War II, world domination.\n\n1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:24.320\n There's no question in my mind,\n\n1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:26.680\n but we're going about it in our way\n\n1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:29.000\n as opposed to Hitler's way.\n\n1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.160\n So just to finish your thought, where do they go?\n\n1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:33.120\n What's stage two?\n\n1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:36.880\n Okay, let's say they take, Ukraine takes back Donbas.\n\n1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:40.520\n Let's say people get killed in large quantities.\n\n1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:42.000\n So we now to the next stage,\n\n1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.400\n we're finished with the Minsk II agreements\n\n1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:45.840\n that were never adhered to.\n\n1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:46.680\n So what does Russia do?\n\n1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:48.880\n They wait for the next aggression,\n\n1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:52.000\n which is gonna come in one form or another.\n\n1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.960\n Perhaps in Georgia, I don't know what happened,\n\n1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:56.480\n what the US is thinking,\n\n1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:01.480\n but the US cannot say Russia has done anything.\n\n1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:05.160\n They have not used violence to stop Donbas\n\n1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:07.920\n from belonging back to Ukraine, right?\n\n1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:10.080\n So you're in a new setup now.\n\n1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.240\n It's a whole thing rearranges.\n\n1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:15.560\n Now you have, but you still have nuclear weapons,\n\n1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:17.800\n and you still have a Russian nuclear weapons,\n\n1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.520\n and they're serious weapons.\n\n1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:21.560\n They're very well developed, crude,\n\n1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:24.320\n but not as refined as the American nuclear force,\n\n1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:26.720\n but powerful.\n\n1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:27.960\n That becomes another game.\n\n1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:29.560\n Then you open another chess board,\n\n1:10:29.560 --> 1:10:31.720\n and you still haven't been condemned.\n\n1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.400\n The sanctions haven't been imposed.\n\n1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:35.440\n That's a new, it's a new game.\n\n1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:36.880\n Could he have done, could he have lived with that?\n\n1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:39.160\n That's the question I ask myself.\n\n1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:41.960\n So you see ultimately Ukraine today\n\n1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:43.960\n as a battleground for the proxy war\n\n1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:45.640\n between Russia and the United States.\n\n1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:49.120\n The United States would have then NATOized Ukraine,\n\n1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.360\n or certainly put more weapons in.\n\n1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:53.480\n The United States has already done a lot in Ukraine\n\n1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:57.800\n with intelligence, with training advisors.\n\n1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:00.800\n The intelligence aspect of the Ukrainian army\n\n1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:04.120\n has been raised enormously by the United States contribution.\n\n1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:05.920\n Is it possible for you to steal man,\n\n1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:07.960\n to play devil's advocate against yourself,\n\n1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:11.940\n and say that Vladimir Zelensky\n\n1:11:11.940 --> 1:11:14.920\n is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation?\n\n1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.240\n And in a way against Russia,\n\n1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.120\n but also against the United States,\n\n1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:21.880\n it just happens that for now, the United States\n\n1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:23.960\n is a useful ally.\n\n1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:27.140\n But ultimately, the man, the leader,\n\n1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:29.640\n is fighting for the sovereignty of his nation.\n\n1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:31.280\n I would think, he thinks so.\n\n1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:33.200\n Yes, and he could say that.\n\n1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:35.240\n But he's not acknowledging that the sovereignty\n\n1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:38.320\n of his nation was stolen in 2014\n\n1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:42.960\n with the coup d'tat that brought this right sector\n\n1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:46.400\n into power, and they have controlled the country since then.\n\n1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:49.120\n It's thuggery, what they've done.\n\n1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:52.080\n The Medvedev case is a case in point.\n\n1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:53.840\n They just take what they need.\n\n1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:55.880\n They go to a house, and they have a,\n\n1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:57.640\n how many people have been killed?\n\n1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:02.640\n Serious people, journalists killed by these battalions.\n\n1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:04.560\n That's what people don't realize.\n\n1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:06.160\n In other words, you can't speak out.\n\n1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:08.440\n A person like me would have been on the death list\n\n1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.000\n on day five.\n\n1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:13.480\n There's no opposition to Zelensky,\n\n1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:16.000\n so he doesn't have a real sovereignty.\n\n1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.840\n It was a stolen sovereignty.\n\n1:12:17.840 --> 1:12:21.280\n Do you think President Zelensky would accept\n\n1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:24.160\n an interview with you today?\n\n1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.720\n Actually, since I made Ukraine on Fire,\n\n1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:29.920\n a documentary which perhaps you've seen,\n\n1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:34.920\n which records the incidents of 2014\n\n1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:37.820\n and the Maidan demonstrations,\n\n1:12:37.820 --> 1:12:40.600\n and shows you the dishonesty behind it,\n\n1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:43.000\n no, I think that they've been very negative,\n\n1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.320\n and they would kill me if I was in Ukraine.\n\n1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.360\n I mean, they don't have any,\n\n1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:50.400\n these people are very tough.\n\n1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:52.760\n These are as rough as they come, in my opinion,\n\n1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:54.120\n and I've seen rough in my life.\n\n1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:57.920\n I mean, these guys are not playing fair at all.\n\n1:12:57.920 --> 1:12:59.360\n These are death squads.\n\n1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:01.080\n No, I don't think, and Zelensky would have\n\n1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:02.920\n nothing to do with it, but of course,\n\n1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.460\n it would be dangerous for me,\n\n1:13:04.460 --> 1:13:07.800\n and they've been very hostile in their policies\n\n1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:11.320\n to any Ukrainians abroad who are also threatened.\n\n1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:12.840\n In other words, you could be in Paris,\n\n1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:16.080\n but if you speak out too much,\n\n1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.840\n I think Ukrainians know that they're gonna be targeted,\n\n1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:21.680\n and I think that's part of the reason they don't talk.\n\n1:13:21.680 --> 1:13:24.800\n A lot of them, you have to take the anti Russian line,\n\n1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.480\n but I think a lot of them are divided.\n\n1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:29.120\n So you think you would be killed,\n\n1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.920\n and Zelensky wouldn't even know about it, so there is?\n\n1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:34.800\n Well, I don't think, if I was killed certainly abroad,\n\n1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:35.880\n no, they wouldn't kill me abroad.\n\n1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:37.600\n I think they'd figure out a way.\n\n1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.360\n No, no, no, no, if you traveled to Ukraine, I mean.\n\n1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:42.600\n I wouldn't get in, I wouldn't get in,\n\n1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:44.520\n except through Donbass, I'd come through.\n\n1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:46.160\n There are some Americans in Donbass\n\n1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:48.080\n who are reporting on the war there,\n\n1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:49.640\n and I read their reports, actually.\n\n1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:50.820\n They're pretty interesting,\n\n1:13:50.820 --> 1:13:53.180\n because they show you the cruelty of what's going on,\n\n1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:55.440\n but never mentioned in the West, never.\n\n1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.200\n That's what's so strange about this.\n\n1:13:58.200 --> 1:13:59.920\n This is a modern world that we're living in,\n\n1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:02.020\n and yet this information is not coming out\n\n1:14:02.020 --> 1:14:03.520\n to the mass of the people,\n\n1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:06.700\n and on the contrary, the United States has closed down\n\n1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:11.700\n all the information centers that are possible\n\n1:14:11.700 --> 1:14:15.060\n to alternative news getting to the American people.\n\n1:14:15.060 --> 1:14:16.420\n They've seriously made an effort,\n\n1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:20.060\n and the BBC, English, and France.\n\n1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:22.400\n I was shocked when France closed RT down,\n\n1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:24.380\n because RT is actually pretty good.\n\n1:14:24.380 --> 1:14:27.200\n Yes, they may, it's called, there are distortions,\n\n1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:29.140\n but you know as well as I do, because you hear,\n\n1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:33.260\n you speak that RT has done a very brave job\n\n1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:35.320\n of putting correspondents into the field\n\n1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:36.620\n in very dangerous positions,\n\n1:14:36.620 --> 1:14:38.620\n and they've gotten great footage\n\n1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:40.760\n of some of the violence that's going on.\n\n1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:43.720\n Well, given the wall of propaganda in the West,\n\n1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:47.380\n I also see the wall of propaganda in Russia,\n\n1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:49.380\n the wall of propaganda in China,\n\n1:14:49.380 --> 1:14:51.900\n the wall of propaganda in India.\n\n1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:54.220\n What do we do with these walls of propaganda?\n\n1:14:54.220 --> 1:14:55.460\n Yes, let's talk about Russia,\n\n1:14:55.460 --> 1:14:57.320\n because you would know more about it,\n\n1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.740\n but my last experience there, newspapers,\n\n1:15:00.740 --> 1:15:03.400\n it was more interesting, put it this way,\n\n1:15:03.400 --> 1:15:06.540\n when I went to Venezuela, the United States was saying\n\n1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:09.300\n back then that Chavez controlled the press.\n\n1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:11.660\n I get to Venezuela, and there's nothing but criticism\n\n1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:12.940\n of Chavez in the press.\n\n1:15:12.940 --> 1:15:16.300\n It was owned by the oligarchs of Venezuela,\n\n1:15:16.300 --> 1:15:18.640\n and who hated him, so it was across the board.\n\n1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:22.540\n That's why Chavez opened the state television,\n\n1:15:22.540 --> 1:15:26.180\n spent more money on it, and advertised his point of view\n\n1:15:26.180 --> 1:15:27.620\n through state television.\n\n1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:32.180\n But in Russia, there is, what I saw was criticism.\n\n1:15:32.180 --> 1:15:34.480\n I met with a publisher who got the Nobel Prize\n\n1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:38.100\n of that famous newspaper, and his point of view\n\n1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:40.300\n at that time when I spoke to him a few years ago\n\n1:15:40.300 --> 1:15:44.320\n was we're operating, there is criticism of him,\n\n1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:48.060\n but you can't call for the overthrow of the government,\n\n1:15:48.060 --> 1:15:50.700\n nor in Venezuela, nor in the United States for that matter.\n\n1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:53.060\n If you call for the overthrow of the government\n\n1:15:53.060 --> 1:15:55.540\n of the United States, you're gonna be in deep trouble.\n\n1:15:55.540 --> 1:15:57.860\n Well, all right, so to push back on that,\n\n1:15:57.860 --> 1:15:59.620\n it's interesting, it's so interesting,\n\n1:15:59.620 --> 1:16:02.540\n because we mentioned Elon Musk,\n\n1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:06.480\n and there's a way that people sound when they speak freely.\n\n1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.580\n When I speak to, I have family in Ukraine,\n\n1:16:09.580 --> 1:16:11.140\n I have family in Russia.\n\n1:16:11.140 --> 1:16:12.820\n When I speak to people in Russia,\n\n1:16:12.820 --> 1:16:14.100\n let's put my family aside,\n\n1:16:14.100 --> 1:16:15.740\n when I speak to people in Russia,\n\n1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:20.200\n I think there's fear.\n\n1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:23.440\n I think they don't,\n\n1:16:25.860 --> 1:16:28.380\n sometimes when you call for the overthrow of government,\n\n1:16:28.380 --> 1:16:30.860\n that's important, not because you necessarily believe\n\n1:16:30.860 --> 1:16:32.720\n for the overthrow of the government,\n\n1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:36.820\n but you just need to test the power centers\n\n1:16:36.820 --> 1:16:41.060\n and make sure they're responsive to the people.\n\n1:16:41.060 --> 1:16:44.580\n And I feel like there's a mix of fear and apathy\n\n1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:51.140\n that has a different texture than it does\n\n1:16:51.140 --> 1:16:52.440\n in the United States.\n\n1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:58.620\n That worries me, because I would like to see\n\n1:16:58.980 --> 1:17:01.520\n the flourishing of a people in all places.\n\n1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.460\n Well, as I said, my impression was that there's far more\n\n1:17:05.460 --> 1:17:08.980\n freedom in the press than was pictured by the West,\n\n1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:10.900\n and that means different points of view,\n\n1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:12.660\n because the Russians are always arguing with themselves.\n\n1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:14.580\n I've never seen a country that's so contentious.\n\n1:17:14.580 --> 1:17:19.580\n There's more intellectuals in Moscow and the cities\n\n1:17:19.700 --> 1:17:23.420\n than you can believe, and you know the Russian people there.\n\n1:17:23.420 --> 1:17:25.620\n They've been fighting government for years,\n\n1:17:25.620 --> 1:17:27.680\n back from the 1870s, it was czarist times,\n\n1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:30.260\n they're always plotting against the government,\n\n1:17:30.260 --> 1:17:32.900\n and the intelligentsia has known through history\n\n1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:37.140\n as being contentious and anti government in many ways.\n\n1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:39.180\n And we see the same thing,\n\n1:17:39.180 --> 1:17:40.860\n educated people turning against Russia.\n\n1:17:40.860 --> 1:17:41.980\n I don't appreciate those people,\n\n1:17:41.980 --> 1:17:43.900\n because I think they're very spoiled,\n\n1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:45.280\n and they don't understand some of the stuff\n\n1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:46.620\n that's going on in the West.\n\n1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:51.100\n But we have a lot of Russians in Europe and America\n\n1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:55.060\n that attack Russia and sometimes don't understand\n\n1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:57.240\n that they are under pressure from the United States,\n\n1:17:57.240 --> 1:17:59.940\n and they don't understand the size of the pressure.\n\n1:17:59.940 --> 1:18:02.480\n And that's why Putin connects with the people,\n\n1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:05.860\n because he represents the common,\n\n1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:08.820\n more the common man who's saying to you,\n\n1:18:08.820 --> 1:18:11.980\n your interests are threatened, Russia is threatened.\n\n1:18:11.980 --> 1:18:14.220\n We are representing only the interests of Russia,\n\n1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:16.940\n not, we're not an empire, we're not gonna expand.\n\n1:18:16.940 --> 1:18:19.000\n He has no empire intentions,\n\n1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:20.940\n although the West paints it as empire.\n\n1:18:21.940 --> 1:18:24.180\n I see no evidence of it.\n\n1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:26.020\n Why didn't he do something in all these years?\n\n1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:29.140\n Nothing, he did nothing except defend the country\n\n1:18:29.140 --> 1:18:30.980\n in Georgia and in Chechnya.\n\n1:18:30.980 --> 1:18:33.820\n So the imperialist imperative is coming more\n\n1:18:33.820 --> 1:18:34.660\n from the West.\n\n1:18:34.660 --> 1:18:37.420\n It's the imperialist, it's the imperialist agenda.\n\n1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.620\n Going back to, I'm sorry, where we left our discussion off,\n\n1:18:40.620 --> 1:18:42.780\n I mean, I was gonna go on with America\n\n1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:47.620\n not only being censored, closed down now, closed down.\n\n1:18:47.620 --> 1:18:50.180\n And you say it's not fear, well, it is fear.\n\n1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:53.900\n I am scared, because if you get your Facebook page\n\n1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:58.220\n suspended or your YouTube, your Twitter account thrown off,\n\n1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:02.020\n a lot of good people are getting there, thrown off.\n\n1:19:02.020 --> 1:19:04.460\n You can't speak out, it affects your business.\n\n1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:07.660\n It goes back to the 1950s when my father's world,\n\n1:19:07.660 --> 1:19:12.620\n when you could not express any sympathy for a Soviet Union\n\n1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:14.220\n without endangering your job,\n\n1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:16.380\n without basically being not trusted.\n\n1:19:16.380 --> 1:19:20.700\n You had to be part of the program to get along, to go along.\n\n1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:22.660\n Same thing when the United Kingdom,\n\n1:19:22.660 --> 1:19:26.300\n I mean, for all their talk, this Boris Johnson is an idiot.\n\n1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:29.220\n But all their talk about, do you remember their policies\n\n1:19:29.220 --> 1:19:32.260\n with the IRA in Ireland when Ireland was threatening them?\n\n1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:34.140\n They cut off the IRA completely.\n\n1:19:34.140 --> 1:19:37.860\n Gerry Adams, who was a wonderful guy, I met him,\n\n1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:40.260\n was not allowed to even be heard in Britain\n\n1:19:40.260 --> 1:19:41.220\n during certain years.\n\n1:19:41.220 --> 1:19:44.620\n In France, all constantly through the Algerian War,\n\n1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:46.660\n the Algerians were not allowed to be heard.\n\n1:19:46.660 --> 1:19:51.060\n The Algerian War for Independence divided France greatly.\n\n1:19:51.060 --> 1:19:52.820\n You could not even show Paths of Glory,\n\n1:19:52.820 --> 1:19:56.820\n World War I film in France for, I don't know, 20 years\n\n1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:57.900\n after it came out.\n\n1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:00.380\n Censorship is a way of life\n\n1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:02.940\n when democracies also feel threatened.\n\n1:20:02.940 --> 1:20:05.300\n They are much more fragile than they pretend to be.\n\n1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:07.500\n A healthy democracy would take all the criticism\n\n1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:09.300\n in the world and shrug it off and say,\n\n1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:11.340\n okay, that's what's good about our country.\n\n1:20:11.340 --> 1:20:13.340\n Well, I'd like to see that in America.\n\n1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:15.260\n There are times that it's been like that,\n\n1:20:15.260 --> 1:20:17.860\n but it's so scary now.\n\n1:20:17.860 --> 1:20:20.020\n So it is scary, that's what I was trying to say.\n\n1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:22.940\n It's not unscary to me.\n\n1:20:22.940 --> 1:20:26.260\n In China, I would say to you, yes, it's much scarier to me\n\n1:20:26.260 --> 1:20:30.260\n because there is the internet wall that they cut off,\n\n1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:32.620\n and I got into problems in China too\n\n1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:34.700\n because I said something years ago\n\n1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:37.100\n about you have to discover your own history.\n\n1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:38.500\n You have to be honest about Mao.\n\n1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:42.060\n You have to go back and let's make a movie about Mao.\n\n1:20:42.060 --> 1:20:45.740\n That upset them and show his negatives.\n\n1:20:46.900 --> 1:20:49.300\n So China has been much more sensitive than Russia\n\n1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.460\n about criticism, much more.\n\n1:20:51.460 --> 1:20:54.020\n And it is a source of problems, but on the other hand,\n\n1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:56.660\n China has a lot of grievances,\n\n1:20:56.660 --> 1:20:58.700\n a lot going back to the 19th century\n\n1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:01.020\n and the British imperialism of that era\n\n1:21:01.020 --> 1:21:02.620\n and the American imperialism.\n\n1:21:02.620 --> 1:21:07.620\n If you could talk to Vladimir Putin once again now,\n\n1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:11.580\n what kind of things would you talk about here?\n\n1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:13.500\n What kind of questions would you ask?\n\n1:21:13.500 --> 1:21:18.500\n Huh, well, one thing I would certainly ask\n\n1:21:19.300 --> 1:21:21.940\n is what you were thinking on February 23,\n\n1:21:21.940 --> 1:21:24.340\n and I would ask him to reply to my question\n\n1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.580\n about what if you took this to phase two.\n\n1:21:26.580 --> 1:21:28.900\n You surrendered in Donbass.\n\n1:21:28.900 --> 1:21:30.580\n You had no ego about it.\n\n1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:31.420\n You just surrendered.\n\n1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:33.140\n It's in your interest to your country,\n\n1:21:33.140 --> 1:21:36.780\n and you invited all the refugees from Donbass into Russia\n\n1:21:36.780 --> 1:21:38.020\n as much as they can.\n\n1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:40.500\n What would you do now?\n\n1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:43.780\n What's the US next move in your opinion?\n\n1:21:43.780 --> 1:21:46.740\n How are you gonna, okay, where are we gonna go?\n\n1:21:46.740 --> 1:21:48.940\n That would be the key question because it's,\n\n1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:51.020\n but he didn't go that way.\n\n1:21:51.020 --> 1:21:56.020\n He chose to take the sanctions and to go this way.\n\n1:21:56.020 --> 1:21:58.540\n Why he did that is a key question for our time.\n\n1:22:00.460 --> 1:22:01.620\n Perhaps it was a mistake.\n\n1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:03.260\n Perhaps it was his judgment.\n\n1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:05.340\n Perhaps, as I said, but I don't,\n\n1:22:05.340 --> 1:22:07.300\n knowing the man I did, I don't think so.\n\n1:22:07.300 --> 1:22:09.420\n I think it was calculated.\n\n1:22:09.420 --> 1:22:12.380\n Now this is projection and speculation,\n\n1:22:12.380 --> 1:22:14.620\n but there's something different about him\n\n1:22:14.620 --> 1:22:16.820\n in the past several months.\n\n1:22:16.820 --> 1:22:17.980\n It could be the COVID thing,\n\n1:22:17.980 --> 1:22:20.180\n the isolation that you mentioned.\n\n1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:23.940\n I listen to a lot of interviews and speeches in Russian,\n\n1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:28.120\n and there's something about power over time\n\n1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:30.620\n that can change you, that can isolate you.\n\n1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:31.860\n Well, when I was there,\n\n1:22:31.860 --> 1:22:35.820\n no, he'd been in office for already 15 years.\n\n1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:37.140\n He had power.\n\n1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:38.700\n He didn't misuse it in my opinion.\n\n1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:39.540\n He was very even.\n\n1:22:39.540 --> 1:22:42.220\n I saw him go on television and talk to his fellows\n\n1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:44.180\n the same way he always talked to them.\n\n1:22:44.180 --> 1:22:47.700\n He grew in intelligence and knowledge\n\n1:22:47.700 --> 1:22:50.540\n because he had dealings with the whole world.\n\n1:22:50.540 --> 1:22:52.260\n Now people had come to him.\n\n1:22:52.260 --> 1:22:55.620\n He was very well known in Africa and Middle East,\n\n1:22:55.620 --> 1:23:00.620\n certainly Syria, and I just never saw misuse of his power.\n\n1:23:01.780 --> 1:23:03.940\n I saw humility in him, actually.\n\n1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:08.940\n So perhaps there was a calculation and he calculated wrong\n\n1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:12.620\n in terms of what happens if he doesn't invade.\n\n1:23:12.620 --> 1:23:14.060\n Perhaps there was a calculation,\n\n1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:16.900\n perhaps he had a calm and clear mind,\n\n1:23:16.900 --> 1:23:18.360\n and he calculated wrong.\n\n1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:20.380\n Well, he also made the point that he,\n\n1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:22.780\n the talk of Zelensky saying,\n\n1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:25.180\n well, nuclear weapons were gonna come into Ukraine.\n\n1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:28.260\n There was talk about that right before the invasion too,\n\n1:23:28.260 --> 1:23:30.980\n and certainly that would have set off alarms.\n\n1:23:30.980 --> 1:23:34.000\n You know, the United States is already kind of doing that\n\n1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.460\n by not only putting its intelligence\n\n1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:39.660\n and its heavy weaponry into Ukraine,\n\n1:23:39.660 --> 1:23:41.300\n but you've got to deal with the question,\n\n1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:42.480\n the next question that comes up,\n\n1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:44.600\n the most immediate question is,\n\n1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:47.680\n is the United States gonna start?\n\n1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:50.420\n And I'm saying this is good.\n\n1:23:50.420 --> 1:23:52.660\n They're making a lot of noise in United States press\n\n1:23:52.660 --> 1:23:56.360\n about Russia using nuclear weapons and chemical weapons.\n\n1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:58.460\n That's a lot of noise.\n\n1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:00.580\n Again, going back to my analogy,\n\n1:24:00.580 --> 1:24:02.100\n when the United States starts that,\n\n1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:04.280\n it starts the conversation going.\n\n1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:06.380\n It's in the interest of the United States\n\n1:24:07.380 --> 1:24:11.580\n for Russia to be pinned with any kind of chemical\n\n1:24:12.980 --> 1:24:16.560\n or nuclear incident.\n\n1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:19.560\n Except, for example, it'd be very, not simple,\n\n1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:23.380\n but it would be possible to explode a nuclear device\n\n1:24:23.380 --> 1:24:26.620\n in Donbass and kill thousands of people.\n\n1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:29.740\n And we would not know right away who did it,\n\n1:24:29.740 --> 1:24:32.380\n but of course the blame would go right to Russia,\n\n1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:34.460\n right to Russia, even if it didn't make sense,\n\n1:24:34.460 --> 1:24:36.320\n if there was no motivation for it.\n\n1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:38.340\n It would just be blamed on Russia.\n\n1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:40.140\n The United States might well be the one\n\n1:24:40.140 --> 1:24:42.540\n who does that false flag operation.\n\n1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:44.580\n It would not be beyond them.\n\n1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:48.240\n It would be a very dramatic solution\n\n1:24:48.240 --> 1:24:50.700\n to sealing this war off as a major victory\n\n1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:51.540\n for the United States.\n\n1:24:51.540 --> 1:24:52.700\n That's terrifying.\n\n1:24:52.700 --> 1:24:53.740\n No, but it can happen.\n\n1:24:53.740 --> 1:24:54.580\n It can happen.\n\n1:24:54.580 --> 1:24:59.260\n A one kiloton device, low yield, it's possible.\n\n1:24:59.260 --> 1:25:01.860\n So when you walk across that line,\n\n1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:05.020\n you can potentially never walk back.\n\n1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:07.540\n Well, I think the United States is calculating\n\n1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:10.520\n that it's a dangerous, yes, I agree,\n\n1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:13.460\n but I think the neoconservative arrogance is such\n\n1:25:13.460 --> 1:25:16.300\n that they really believe they can push their advantage\n\n1:25:16.300 --> 1:25:20.340\n to the max now because of all these propaganda successes\n\n1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:21.500\n up to now.\n\n1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:23.780\n The Ukrainian army could be wiped out for all we know.\n\n1:25:23.780 --> 1:25:25.960\n There's all this leftists or neo, Nazi brigades,\n\n1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:29.580\n but they're being advised very well by US\n\n1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:30.860\n and they're sending the weapons in,\n\n1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:31.940\n are huge amounts of weapons.\n\n1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:33.020\n What about American budget?\n\n1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:36.020\n No one talks about how much money we're giving to Ukraine.\n\n1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:39.200\n It's a billion dollars already in weaponry\n\n1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:41.780\n and not most of it just poured in.\n\n1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:45.900\n What about, you know, the Russian budget is,\n\n1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:51.060\n defense budget is 60 some billion dollars a year.\n\n1:25:51.060 --> 1:25:54.780\n It's nothing compared to the United States, 1 15th of it.\n\n1:25:54.780 --> 1:25:59.020\n But yet we've put so much weaponry into Ukraine.\n\n1:25:59.020 --> 1:26:03.060\n The money we've spent on Ukraine is equivalent almost\n\n1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:07.060\n to what we spent on COVID in our own country.\n\n1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:10.700\n It's astounding the distortion of our priorities.\n\n1:26:11.700 --> 1:26:12.860\n There's also chemical.\n\n1:26:12.860 --> 1:26:15.820\n Don't forget chemical is probably the easier way to go.\n\n1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:20.500\n But in Syria, there was far too many incidents of America\n\n1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:25.500\n in its quest to demonize Assad and the Russians\n\n1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:27.980\n of all these chemical attacks that were happening\n\n1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:31.140\n that they were vowing came from Russia.\n\n1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:36.140\n And in spite of the fact that Russia just pulled out of the,\n\n1:26:36.660 --> 1:26:38.460\n signed the agreement on chemical arms\n\n1:26:38.460 --> 1:26:42.540\n and apparently destroyed its stock several years ago,\n\n1:26:43.780 --> 1:26:47.660\n it's strange that the strangest incidents happened in Syria.\n\n1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:50.300\n You go back to them, trace every one,\n\n1:26:50.300 --> 1:26:51.900\n good journalism was done.\n\n1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:53.620\n The White Helmets got a lot of fame,\n\n1:26:53.620 --> 1:26:55.060\n but they were corrupted.\n\n1:26:55.060 --> 1:26:58.060\n And many good journalists tried to point out\n\n1:26:58.060 --> 1:27:01.780\n the inconsistencies in the American accusations.\n\n1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:05.780\n Robert Parry among them,\n\n1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:08.620\n who was one of my mentors at Consortium Press.\n\n1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:10.100\n A lot of good, you'd have to go back,\n\n1:27:10.100 --> 1:27:13.420\n but trace each, like you would trace each time\n\n1:27:13.420 --> 1:27:16.020\n they made an accusation against Putin of murder.\n\n1:27:16.020 --> 1:27:19.660\n You need that same kind of Sherlock Holmes intensity,\n\n1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:21.740\n investigation, and they don't do it\n\n1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:24.660\n because the United Nations or the chemical,\n\n1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:27.020\n not the United Nations as much as the chemical people,\n\n1:27:27.020 --> 1:27:30.740\n the organization has been tampered with.\n\n1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:33.220\n If you remember correctly, there was accusations\n\n1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:36.780\n that the chemical investigative unit,\n\n1:27:36.780 --> 1:27:39.980\n I don't know the name of it, was tampered with.\n\n1:27:39.980 --> 1:27:42.900\n And people quit, people who were working on that commission\n\n1:27:42.900 --> 1:27:45.380\n quit and said that this is not legit.\n\n1:27:45.380 --> 1:27:48.780\n So very interesting, that Syria story is wacko.\n\n1:27:48.780 --> 1:27:49.900\n So the United States is willing\n\n1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:52.300\n to use chemical in Syria freely.\n\n1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:53.340\n It did it three, four times.\n\n1:27:53.340 --> 1:27:55.420\n If you remember correctly, Trump was challenged\n\n1:27:55.420 --> 1:27:59.980\n that he did not attack after a chemical incident in Syria.\n\n1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:02.460\n All these newscasters in the United States,\n\n1:28:02.460 --> 1:28:04.700\n the most heaviest of them were saying,\n\n1:28:04.700 --> 1:28:08.860\n well, President Trump is now finally acting\n\n1:28:08.860 --> 1:28:11.180\n like a real president when he attacks,\n\n1:28:11.180 --> 1:28:12.900\n when he drops missiles in Syria.\n\n1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:14.300\n They actually said that.\n\n1:28:14.300 --> 1:28:17.140\n In other words, they wanted Trump to go to war on Syria,\n\n1:28:17.140 --> 1:28:17.980\n but he didn't.\n\n1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:22.980\n Chemical weapons and nuclear is really terrifying.\n\n1:28:23.260 --> 1:28:28.260\n Do you think, now combine this with the fascinating choice\n\n1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:31.260\n in your interviews with Vladimir Putin\n\n1:28:31.260 --> 1:28:36.260\n to watch Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove\n\n1:28:36.300 --> 1:28:38.860\n or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\n\n1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:42.180\n And given the fact that you did that,\n\n1:28:42.180 --> 1:28:46.380\n now looking at the fact that the word nuclear,\n\n1:28:46.380 --> 1:28:49.820\n and it feels like the world hangs\n\n1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:52.180\n on the brink of nuclear war,\n\n1:28:52.180 --> 1:28:55.740\n do you think that that's overstating the case?\n\n1:28:55.740 --> 1:28:58.300\n No, that's what worried me from the beginning,\n\n1:28:58.300 --> 1:29:00.580\n and that's probably why I got involved in all this stuff,\n\n1:29:00.580 --> 1:29:05.580\n because I go back to the 60s when we were so close\n\n1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:07.440\n to nuclear war.\n\n1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:08.720\n I lived through that period,\n\n1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:11.220\n and I thought, as many people did,\n\n1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:14.900\n that this was, it was gonna come now.\n\n1:29:14.900 --> 1:29:16.620\n So I've lived through that,\n\n1:29:16.620 --> 1:29:19.700\n and I didn't sense the period in 83\n\n1:29:19.700 --> 1:29:21.540\n when Reagan took us to the edge,\n\n1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:22.500\n if you remember correctly.\n\n1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:26.380\n Able Archer was an exercise that almost brought us to,\n\n1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:29.240\n because the Russians were really paranoid at that point,\n\n1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:32.860\n and they were responding to our military exercise\n\n1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:33.700\n on Able Archer.\n\n1:29:33.700 --> 1:29:35.580\n There was also the Korean airliner, they went down.\n\n1:29:35.580 --> 1:29:37.500\n There were numerous incidents in the 80s,\n\n1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:39.240\n but I never felt the fear.\n\n1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:43.300\n I thought Reagan was testing the limits,\n\n1:29:43.300 --> 1:29:46.240\n but perhaps if I'd been younger, I would've felt it.\n\n1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:48.340\n But anyway, no, we come close.\n\n1:29:48.340 --> 1:29:51.380\n The United States has risked this several times.\n\n1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:53.540\n If I told you, it would be hard for you to believe,\n\n1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:57.980\n if I could set a scene for you in a drama in 1962\n\n1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:01.180\n when Kennedy has a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\n1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:06.180\n and the CIA, and they talk about a plan,\n\n1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:11.220\n a military plan, to first strike the Soviet Union and China.\n\n1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:16.220\n It was an Eisenhower plan that had been put into potential\n\n1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:23.820\n operation in early 60s or 50s, late 50s, SIOP 62.\n\n1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.820\n This was an attack on the Soviet Union, first strike.\n\n1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:32.220\n That's why the United States has never given up\n\n1:30:32.220 --> 1:30:33.760\n the concept of first strike.\n\n1:30:34.700 --> 1:30:38.520\n It's interesting that the Russian nuclear policy posture\n\n1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:41.860\n is more defensive than the American one,\n\n1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:43.500\n which leaves options open.\n\n1:30:44.900 --> 1:30:49.300\n The same options are open in neoconservative agreements\n\n1:30:49.300 --> 1:30:52.460\n that we see from the late 90s, where they say,\n\n1:30:52.460 --> 1:30:56.140\n the emergence of a rival power will not be tolerated.\n\n1:30:56.140 --> 1:30:58.260\n That's a very broad statement,\n\n1:30:58.260 --> 1:31:01.780\n and it allows you to do a lot, including nuclear.\n\n1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:05.620\n So you have to understand the United States is always,\n\n1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:07.900\n first of all, it breaks so many treaties.\n\n1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:10.180\n We know that from the Putin story\n\n1:31:10.180 --> 1:31:13.940\n about the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002,\n\n1:31:13.940 --> 1:31:17.240\n and then the INF Treaty of, they broke that one.\n\n1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:19.980\n That was the intermediate missiles.\n\n1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:21.380\n That was 2019.\n\n1:31:21.380 --> 1:31:22.920\n I don't know when they broke it off,\n\n1:31:22.920 --> 1:31:25.040\n but the United States has not been very faithful\n\n1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:29.560\n on its nuclear agreements, and so I don't know\n\n1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:32.140\n that we can even deal with the United States diplomatically.\n\n1:31:32.140 --> 1:31:34.220\n It seems to be impossible.\n\n1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:36.240\n Now, it brings me to Biden.\n\n1:31:36.240 --> 1:31:40.220\n And this is the opposite of Kennedy.\n\n1:31:40.220 --> 1:31:43.820\n Kennedy was a Catholic Irish anti imperialist.\n\n1:31:43.820 --> 1:31:45.300\n Biden seems to be the opposite.\n\n1:31:45.300 --> 1:31:48.300\n He seems to be a get along, go along guy\n\n1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:50.780\n who's been not only old,\n\n1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:52.760\n but he's also gone along with this program,\n\n1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:56.140\n which I voted for Biden because I feared Trump,\n\n1:31:56.140 --> 1:31:59.020\n but I thought Biden at a certain age would mellow.\n\n1:31:59.020 --> 1:32:00.260\n I really did.\n\n1:32:00.260 --> 1:32:01.620\n He's not mellowed, apparently.\n\n1:32:01.620 --> 1:32:05.040\n He's still listening to these people, and he believes them.\n\n1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:08.300\n And it seems that his, that horrible woman,\n\n1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:10.540\n Victoria Nuland, who was Under Secretary of State,\n\n1:32:10.540 --> 1:32:14.580\n he appointed her to this sector of the world.\n\n1:32:14.580 --> 1:32:16.020\n She's very influential,\n\n1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:19.460\n and she's been one of the worst people on Ukraine.\n\n1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:21.860\n Obviously, she's behind the coup.\n\n1:32:21.860 --> 1:32:24.740\n She was the one who boasted that, you know,\n\n1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:28.780\n we got our man in, Yats, whatever it is, Yatsenuk.\n\n1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:32.780\n And also, remember the famous statement, fuck the EU?\n\n1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.400\n All these things, but she's back,\n\n1:32:34.400 --> 1:32:37.340\n and she said the other day about if the Soviets,\n\n1:32:37.340 --> 1:32:41.440\n if the Russians use nuclear weaponry of any kind,\n\n1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:44.020\n there's gonna be a horrible price to pay.\n\n1:32:44.020 --> 1:32:44.900\n She was out of the blue.\n\n1:32:44.900 --> 1:32:46.660\n I said, what the hell is she doing?\n\n1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:48.660\n She's talking nuclear all of a sudden.\n\n1:32:48.660 --> 1:32:52.780\n And then since that day, everybody in the US press,\n\n1:32:52.780 --> 1:32:55.620\n all the shows have gone, talk nuclear, nuclear, nuclear.\n\n1:32:55.620 --> 1:33:04.620\n Secretary of State has done it, Blinken, it scares you.\n\n1:33:05.580 --> 1:33:08.300\n If you think about it, the United States scares me.\n\n1:33:08.300 --> 1:33:11.300\n So that's the military industrial complex machine,\n\n1:33:11.300 --> 1:33:13.220\n fully functional, fully operational\n\n1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:14.140\n behind this whole thing.\n\n1:33:14.140 --> 1:33:14.980\n Certainly is.\n\n1:33:14.980 --> 1:33:16.220\n Is that what's to blame?\n\n1:33:16.220 --> 1:33:17.460\n Certainly is.\n\n1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:18.900\n That's why I showed him Strangelove,\n\n1:33:18.900 --> 1:33:20.700\n because I wanted him to show him.\n\n1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:22.900\n I wanted Mr. Putin to say, look at this film.\n\n1:33:22.900 --> 1:33:23.720\n You never saw it.\n\n1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:24.860\n How can you not say, you know,\n\n1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:27.740\n it's a seminal film in American history\n\n1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:28.940\n to those people who care.\n\n1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:33.940\n And it shows you the Kubrick had a pacifist, thank God,\n\n1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:39.100\n antiwar mentality, which he showed in Bows of Glory\n\n1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:40.840\n as well as Strangelove.\n\n1:33:42.300 --> 1:33:46.180\n And it's such a dire, well done scenario\n\n1:33:46.180 --> 1:33:48.700\n that I wanted Mr. Putin to be aware\n\n1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:50.500\n of the way the United States thinks.\n\n1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:53.940\n Yeah, the absurdity of escalation,\n\n1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:56.500\n the absurdity of war at the largest scale,\n\n1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:59.420\n the absurdity of nuclear war, especially.\n\n1:33:59.420 --> 1:34:02.060\n Can we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?\n\n1:34:03.740 --> 1:34:04.580\n Can we?\n\n1:34:04.580 --> 1:34:05.400\n Can we?\n\n1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:06.240\n Yes, yes we can.\n\n1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:07.740\n What's the path to walk back?\n\n1:34:07.740 --> 1:34:08.580\n Reason.\n\n1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:09.420\n Reason.\n\n1:34:09.420 --> 1:34:10.240\n Between who and whom?\n\n1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:11.380\n Reason and diplomacy.\n\n1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:12.420\n There's no reason.\n\n1:34:12.420 --> 1:34:15.180\n I mean, talk to the guy.\n\n1:34:15.180 --> 1:34:17.860\n Mr. Biden, why don't you calm down\n\n1:34:17.860 --> 1:34:20.860\n and go and talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow?\n\n1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:23.020\n Why don't you just sit across the table from him\n\n1:34:23.020 --> 1:34:26.060\n and try to have a discussion without falling\n\n1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:28.440\n into ideologies and stuff like that?\n\n1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:31.180\n Can I ask you for advice?\n\n1:34:31.180 --> 1:34:34.740\n You did some of the most difficult interviews ever.\n\n1:34:34.740 --> 1:34:38.460\n Do you have advice that you can give to someone like me\n\n1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:40.540\n or anyone hoping to understand something\n\n1:34:40.540 --> 1:34:44.780\n about a human being sitting across from them\n\n1:34:44.780 --> 1:34:47.860\n about what it takes to do a good interview?\n\n1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:48.760\n You're doing one.\n\n1:34:48.760 --> 1:34:52.720\n Well, no, but there's a, listen,\n\n1:34:52.720 --> 1:34:55.080\n there's levels to this game.\n\n1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:58.080\n And interviewing somebody like Vladimir Putin,\n\n1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:03.080\n also language barrier, sit across from the man,\n\n1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:04.920\n try to keep an open mind,\n\n1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:08.840\n try to also ask challenging questions,\n\n1:35:08.840 --> 1:35:11.040\n but not challenging with an agenda,\n\n1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:14.340\n but seeking to understand and understand deeply.\n\n1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:15.920\n How do you do that?\n\n1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:17.200\n Seeking the truth.\n\n1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:18.080\n It's very simple.\n\n1:35:18.080 --> 1:35:20.960\n Seeking the truth, being a questioner like you are.\n\n1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:23.400\n You wanna know what is really going on.\n\n1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:26.960\n I could not get anywhere with Biden or Bush\n\n1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.400\n or for that matter, Obama.\n\n1:35:28.400 --> 1:35:30.080\n They'd be opaque with me.\n\n1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:31.360\n There's no interview possible\n\n1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:32.640\n with the president of the United States\n\n1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:34.920\n because he's got to stand for all the stuff\n\n1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:37.640\n that they stand for, which is imperialism,\n\n1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:39.160\n which is control of the world.\n\n1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:41.360\n How can you defend that?\n\n1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:42.560\n No one's gonna come out and say that.\n\n1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:44.720\n They're always gonna blame the enemy.\n\n1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:45.760\n They're gonna blame Iran.\n\n1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:47.920\n They're gonna blame China.\n\n1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:50.040\n So with some people, it may not be possible\n\n1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:51.360\n to break through the opaqueness.\n\n1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:52.200\n You can't, you can't.\n\n1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:54.280\n I mean, have you ever seen an interview with the president\n\n1:35:54.280 --> 1:35:56.040\n besides being personable,\n\n1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:00.200\n where he actually discussed American policy?\n\n1:36:00.200 --> 1:36:03.600\n Yeah, I mean, not really, but maybe after their president.\n\n1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:06.880\n I could see Obama being able to do such an interview.\n\n1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:10.220\n I could see George W. being able to do such an interview.\n\n1:36:10.220 --> 1:36:13.360\n Or are they not able to reflect at all on the?\n\n1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:15.200\n George W. hasn't shown much conscience\n\n1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:17.680\n in terms of thinking about what he's done.\n\n1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:18.640\n You've seen that.\n\n1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:20.520\n You ever see my movie, W.?\n\n1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:22.240\n I think that's one of my best movies\n\n1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:25.400\n because it shows a man who's just out of his depth\n\n1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:28.320\n and has no, he has a conscience at the end of the movie.\n\n1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:31.080\n If you remember correctly, he talks to his wife\n\n1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:33.200\n and he says, I don't get it.\n\n1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:34.480\n I'm trying to do good in the world.\n\n1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:36.880\n I've done, I believe in good and right.\n\n1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:40.920\n And why do people not understand that kind of complaint\n\n1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:42.660\n as if he can't get outside himself\n\n1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:45.040\n to understand the way other people think?\n\n1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:47.800\n Empathies, walking like a dramatist is what I do.\n\n1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:50.720\n You walk in the footsteps of other people.\n\n1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:52.440\n When I did a movie about Richard Nixon,\n\n1:36:52.440 --> 1:36:54.080\n it wasn't because I liked him.\n\n1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:55.820\n It was because I wanted to,\n\n1:36:55.820 --> 1:36:57.960\n I think I understood a part of him because of my father\n\n1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:00.680\n and I think I wanted to walk in his footsteps.\n\n1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:03.160\n That's not to say I sympathize with him because I didn't.\n\n1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:05.920\n I don't think he helped the American cause at all,\n\n1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:08.920\n but it was empathize as opposed to sympathize.\n\n1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:10.080\n Same thing with Bush.\n\n1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:11.720\n People were shocked when I did the Bush movie.\n\n1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:16.720\n They said, how can you be in any way receptive to this guy?\n\n1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:19.720\n That's wrong.\n\n1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:22.120\n Dramatists don't have political positions.\n\n1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:23.940\n They walk in the shoes of.\n\n1:37:23.940 --> 1:37:27.160\n That's why Bush movie perhaps was surprising\n\n1:37:27.160 --> 1:37:29.380\n and many people didn't care for it.\n\n1:37:29.380 --> 1:37:34.380\n Maybe that's what, but that's, you've got to go there.\n\n1:37:34.840 --> 1:37:38.080\n If you did a movie about a villain, you have to go there.\n\n1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.000\n You have to walk in their shoes.\n\n1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:41.840\n Yes.\n\n1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:43.640\n So see them, cause they usually,\n\n1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:46.640\n villains usually see themselves as the hero.\n\n1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:47.560\n Yes.\n\n1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:51.160\n So you have to consider what is it like to live in a world\n\n1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:53.880\n where this person is the hero?\n\n1:37:53.880 --> 1:37:54.720\n Yes.\n\n1:37:55.680 --> 1:37:56.980\n Is that a burden?\n\n1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:57.820\n Is that hard?\n\n1:37:57.820 --> 1:37:59.480\n Not for George W. Bush.\n\n1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:02.600\n He's bitching because they didn't understand him,\n\n1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:05.140\n but he had a good vision he said of democracy\n\n1:38:05.140 --> 1:38:09.720\n and you know, democracy forgives a lot of sins.\n\n1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:11.780\n Can I ask you a hard question on that?\n\n1:38:11.780 --> 1:38:13.280\n Yes, sure.\n\n1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:16.860\n So because empathy is so important to a great interview,\n\n1:38:16.860 --> 1:38:19.400\n let's ask the most challenging version of empathy,\n\n1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:23.080\n which is when you're sitting across from a man\n\n1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:26.840\n on the brink of war that leads to tens of millions\n\n1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:28.620\n of deaths, which is Hitler.\n\n1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:31.280\n So if you could interview Hitler in 1939,\n\n1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.780\n as the drums of war start to beat or 1941\n\n1:38:36.780 --> 1:38:39.840\n when they're already full on war, but there's still\n\n1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:44.100\n a lot of pacifists, there's still a lot of people unsure\n\n1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:48.320\n what are the motivations behind what Hitler's doing.\n\n1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:49.640\n How would you do that interview?\n\n1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:50.760\n Well it depends when you do it.\n\n1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:54.480\n If you do it in 38, I certainly would have,\n\n1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:57.120\n no you have to, if you sit down across from Hitler,\n\n1:38:57.120 --> 1:38:57.960\n you empathize.\n\n1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:59.040\n What is your beef?\n\n1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:00.680\n Where have you been?\n\n1:39:00.680 --> 1:39:02.200\n What is your consciousness?\n\n1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:05.200\n Why do you hate Jewish people?\n\n1:39:05.200 --> 1:39:10.200\n Why, what is, all these questions that come up.\n\n1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:13.880\n His sense of grievance as a result of World War I.\n\n1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:16.380\n There's justifications there, et cetera.\n\n1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:19.120\n But if I, and by the way, Churchill was trying\n\n1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:21.120\n to make a deal with him in 38.\n\n1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:23.040\n That's a fact that people don't know.\n\n1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:25.780\n Churchill himself, there was still the desire\n\n1:39:25.780 --> 1:39:28.180\n in England to make peace with Germany.\n\n1:39:29.880 --> 1:39:34.440\n And it was seen as a possible, what Churchill\n\n1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:36.900\n really wanted was Hitler to go against Russia.\n\n1:39:36.900 --> 1:39:40.080\n And anything to destroy the Bolsheviks.\n\n1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:42.760\n So he was using Hitler as much as he could\n\n1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:46.760\n to go after Russia, but Hitler was too elusive\n\n1:39:46.760 --> 1:39:48.640\n to get, to pin him down.\n\n1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:51.640\n But if you remember, Hitler was very kind at the end of,\n\n1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:53.600\n kind is not the right word, was,\n\n1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:58.560\n did not go after the British Empire when he had France.\n\n1:39:58.560 --> 1:39:59.560\n And he could have.\n\n1:40:00.740 --> 1:40:04.300\n He had another objective, which was obviously the East.\n\n1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:08.880\n So Hitler's goal, I think, he always had an admiration\n\n1:40:08.880 --> 1:40:09.720\n for England.\n\n1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:11.740\n It's an interesting story, always.\n\n1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:15.320\n And the empire.\n\n1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:19.320\n Yes, and certainly Churchill, we have no doubts now\n\n1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:22.560\n from history revisionism that Churchill's interest,\n\n1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.560\n main interest, was not Germany.\n\n1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.160\n It was the British Empire.\n\n1:40:26.160 --> 1:40:28.480\n And to preserve it to India, the road to India\n\n1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:31.240\n and all that, and Middle East.\n\n1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:34.360\n Churchill fought the entire war with the concept\n\n1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.160\n of preserving the British Empire.\n\n1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:39.920\n All his goals, he sent America on a goose chase into Italy,\n\n1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:41.840\n you could argue, instead of establishing\n\n1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:44.440\n a sincere second front in Western Europe.\n\n1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:49.120\n Interesting man.\n\n1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:50.480\n So I would have tried to get, you know,\n\n1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:52.660\n I think I would have approached it the same way.\n\n1:40:52.660 --> 1:40:55.080\n In 1939, it would have been a different story\n\n1:40:55.080 --> 1:40:58.080\n because at that point, he'd attacked Poland,\n\n1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:00.420\n and in 1940, France.\n\n1:41:00.420 --> 1:41:02.440\n So it's another ball game.\n\n1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:05.320\n But certainly, at whatever point you talk to him,\n\n1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.660\n I would try to understand his point.\n\n1:41:07.660 --> 1:41:09.200\n I'm not judging you, Hitler.\n\n1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:11.360\n I'm saying to you, tell me what you're thinking.\n\n1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:12.560\n Why are you invading Russia?\n\n1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:13.800\n What's your thought?\n\n1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:15.160\n That's all an interviewer should do.\n\n1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:18.080\n He shouldn't be expressing his contempt for Hitler,\n\n1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:21.420\n which like an American journalist interviewing Putin,\n\n1:41:21.420 --> 1:41:25.480\n I'm getting brownie points for expressing my contempt for you.\n\n1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:27.880\n That doesn't wash with me.\n\n1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:29.160\n That's ugly.\n\n1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:30.280\n Seek to understand.\n\n1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:31.120\n Yes.\n\n1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:33.760\n This is a technical question,\n\n1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:36.840\n but was language a barrier as an interviewer?\n\n1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:37.780\n To some degree.\n\n1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:40.160\n It's very hard to learn Russian.\n\n1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:42.520\n But I had very, they have excellent translators\n\n1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:43.880\n in the Kremlin, excellent.\n\n1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:47.560\n They are people who are trained very seriously\n\n1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:50.460\n for months or years before they,\n\n1:41:50.460 --> 1:41:53.720\n these people are young and they're very bright.\n\n1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:55.520\n I was very impressed with the Russian translators.\n\n1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:56.360\n It's interesting.\n\n1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.260\n I mean, I'm impressed as well,\n\n1:41:58.260 --> 1:42:00.560\n but there's a humor that's lost.\n\n1:42:01.760 --> 1:42:03.680\n There's a wit, a dry wit.\n\n1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:05.860\n There's stuff said between the lines.\n\n1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:09.380\n That's not actually how much content,\n\n1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:12.720\n but it's more kind of the things\n\n1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:15.360\n that make communication more frictionless.\n\n1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:20.360\n It's the, there's a kind of sadness to a Russian humor\n\n1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:22.720\n that permeates all things.\n\n1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:24.840\n And that sometimes is lost in translation.\n\n1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:26.960\n The translation is a little bit colder,\n\n1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.880\n meaning it just conveys the facts.\n\n1:42:29.880 --> 1:42:31.720\n Would you call it sardonic humor?\n\n1:42:31.720 --> 1:42:33.440\n I would say so, yeah.\n\n1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:34.320\n And so it's interesting.\n\n1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.440\n But I think you could see that from facial expressions\n\n1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.160\n when you're sitting across from the person\n\n1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:39.000\n and you can feel it.\n\n1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:39.820\n I feel it, yeah.\n\n1:42:39.820 --> 1:42:41.280\n You can feel it.\n\n1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:42.920\n Let me ask you in general,\n\n1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:48.500\n what's the role of love in the human condition,\n\n1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:50.760\n in your life, in life in general?\n\n1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:53.720\n You've talked, you looked at some of the darkest aspect\n\n1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:55.600\n of human nature.\n\n1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:57.160\n What's the role of this,\n\n1:42:57.160 --> 1:42:59.520\n one of the more beautiful aspects of human nature?\n\n1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:01.040\n I think without love, I wouldn't,\n\n1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:02.920\n I don't think I'd be able to carry on.\n\n1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:06.920\n I think that love is my, love is the greatest,\n\n1:43:08.520 --> 1:43:11.120\n the ability to love is the greatest virtue you can have.\n\n1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:14.960\n It's the ability to share with another,\n\n1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:17.680\n with your family, with your children, with your wife,\n\n1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:19.440\n with your lover, your partner.\n\n1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:22.360\n It's an ability to extend yourself into the world\n\n1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:23.860\n and it brings empathy with it.\n\n1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:25.840\n If you love well,\n\n1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:28.400\n I think you expand it to the human race too.\n\n1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:32.440\n And it's the strength behind the great novelists,\n\n1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:34.600\n the great artists of our time.\n\n1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:40.640\n I think part of the reason I suppose\n\n1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:42.800\n we're scared of science sometimes\n\n1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:44.320\n is because the scientists sometimes\n\n1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:45.640\n don't express that clearly.\n\n1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:49.480\n You can lose that when you focus on the facts,\n\n1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:54.480\n on empirical data, on the science of things.\n\n1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:58.320\n You can lose the humanity that's between the lines.\n\n1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:00.720\n I'm often struck by when I talk to scientists\n\n1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:02.040\n and I've talked to a few,\n\n1:44:02.040 --> 1:44:03.920\n that how arrogant they can be about,\n\n1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.960\n they don't talk to you if you don't understand their world\n\n1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:09.120\n and they talk to each other and there's an arrogance,\n\n1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:10.620\n a closed circle kind of thing.\n\n1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:12.520\n Oh, he's not at my level, I can't,\n\n1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:14.580\n there's no discussion to be had with this person,\n\n1:44:14.580 --> 1:44:16.200\n he's a human being.\n\n1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:18.080\n That arrogance is terrifying to me\n\n1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:23.040\n because it's next door neighbor to closed mindedness\n\n1:44:23.040 --> 1:44:25.440\n which then can be used by charismatic leaders\n\n1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:27.440\n as it was in Nazi Germany\n\n1:44:27.440 --> 1:44:29.740\n to commit some of the worst atrocities.\n\n1:44:29.740 --> 1:44:34.040\n The scientists can be used as pawns\n\n1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:36.800\n in a very cruel game.\n\n1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:39.560\n What advice would you give to young people?\n\n1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:43.720\n You've done, first of all, some of the greatest films ever.\n\n1:44:43.720 --> 1:44:47.920\n You've lived a heck of a life.\n\n1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:51.180\n You've, were fearless and bold\n\n1:44:51.180 --> 1:44:53.960\n in asking some really difficult questions of this world.\n\n1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:56.280\n What advice would you give to young people today,\n\n1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:59.760\n high school, college, about career?\n\n1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:02.800\n How to have a career they can be proud of\n\n1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:05.000\n or how to have a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:07.840\n Well, I have three children\n\n1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:11.920\n so obviously I'm not necessarily the best advisor\n\n1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:15.640\n in the world and I do find that the children,\n\n1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:17.460\n I've raised them with a sense of freedom\n\n1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:19.280\n and they do what they want.\n\n1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:22.800\n In the end, it's their life, their destiny, their character.\n\n1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:24.520\n That's what comes out.\n\n1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:27.040\n You can try to influence it\n\n1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:30.360\n but you can try to get your daughter to wake up\n\n1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:32.800\n at a certain hour in the day but it never works.\n\n1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:37.240\n So I long ago gave up on that\n\n1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:40.200\n and my children are all grown now\n\n1:45:40.200 --> 1:45:44.500\n but aside from that, I think if I was a teacher in a school\n\n1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:48.720\n and teaching film, I'd say to the students,\n\n1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:49.920\n get an education.\n\n1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:53.640\n You can't just look at film because it's not\n\n1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:55.900\n a full education, it's not the spectrum.\n\n1:45:55.900 --> 1:45:58.000\n I don't think you should teach film as a,\n\n1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.760\n I think you need a base in other worlds.\n\n1:46:02.760 --> 1:46:05.840\n One of the greatest courses I took at NYU was,\n\n1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:08.520\n and I was a war veteran on the GI Bill\n\n1:46:08.520 --> 1:46:10.300\n so I was older than the other students.\n\n1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:13.520\n One of the great, I took a class outside the film school\n\n1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:18.160\n in Greek classics because I hadn't had much history\n\n1:46:18.160 --> 1:46:20.680\n and I wanted to know more about the world of Homer\n\n1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:23.600\n and so forth and the teacher opened my eyes\n\n1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:26.380\n to so much in that class and I wrote about it\n\n1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:29.600\n in my memoir, it's called Chasing the Light\n\n1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:33.080\n about Professor Leahy and what he did to me.\n\n1:46:33.080 --> 1:46:36.600\n He gave me the concepts clearly of consciousness\n\n1:46:36.600 --> 1:46:39.560\n which is the Homeric theme of Odysseus\n\n1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:44.560\n and also lethe, L E T H E, which is sleep\n\n1:46:47.240 --> 1:46:52.240\n and how most of the crew, Odysseus's crew,\n\n1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:56.200\n were experiencing lethe and how necessary it was\n\n1:46:56.200 --> 1:46:57.480\n to stay awake.\n\n1:46:58.360 --> 1:47:01.880\n So it's not just film, it's just you have to learn\n\n1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:04.460\n the world as much as you can when you're young\n\n1:47:04.460 --> 1:47:09.460\n and so that I think is the basis of a good education\n\n1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:15.040\n and a classic one is important, a basis.\n\n1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:18.120\n I think then you go on and you can learn computer\n\n1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:20.640\n if you want but that's specialization.\n\n1:47:21.900 --> 1:47:24.600\n If you're a computer geek, is that a life?\n\n1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:26.380\n Does that give you enough satisfaction?\n\n1:47:26.380 --> 1:47:29.860\n Do you get the joy out of people?\n\n1:47:29.860 --> 1:47:32.120\n No, just like filmmaking is a skill.\n\n1:47:32.120 --> 1:47:32.960\n Yes, right.\n\n1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.640\n You have the broad background to understand the world,\n\n1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:40.360\n literature, history.\n\n1:47:40.360 --> 1:47:41.200\n Absolutely.\n\n1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.700\n So one of the things about being human is life is finite.\n\n1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:50.000\n It ends.\n\n1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.200\n Do you think about your death?\n\n1:47:52.200 --> 1:47:53.240\n Are you afraid of your death?\n\n1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:54.320\n Yeah, sure.\n\n1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.640\n Absolutely, you have to come to terms with death\n\n1:47:56.640 --> 1:47:58.640\n and that's a tough one for many people.\n\n1:47:58.640 --> 1:47:59.480\n It's always there.\n\n1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:01.320\n I'm older than you, obviously,\n\n1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:02.960\n and I'm getting closer to it.\n\n1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:04.820\n Couldn't happen any day, actually.\n\n1:48:04.820 --> 1:48:06.260\n When you get to a certain age,\n\n1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:08.480\n you can't assume that you're gonna be alive tomorrow.\n\n1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:10.360\n So I try to deal with that.\n\n1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.320\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:15.520\n Much less so than I was when I was younger.\n\n1:48:15.520 --> 1:48:16.760\n Remember, I was in Vietnam\n\n1:48:16.760 --> 1:48:18.320\n but I thought I dealt with it there\n\n1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:21.800\n but when I came back, I realized that I wanted to live.\n\n1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:24.600\n So yes, I've learned over time\n\n1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:27.940\n to get more and more used to it and get ready for it.\n\n1:48:27.940 --> 1:48:31.000\n What's a good answer to the question of why live?\n\n1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.480\n So the realization that you wanted to live.\n\n1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:36.580\n What was the reason to live?\n\n1:48:36.580 --> 1:48:38.720\n Because it was better than being one of those corpses\n\n1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:40.760\n that I saw in the jungle.\n\n1:48:40.760 --> 1:48:43.280\n I saw how finite death is.\n\n1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:48.080\n Are there things in your life you regret?\n\n1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:48.920\n Oh, sure.\n\n1:48:48.920 --> 1:48:49.760\n Too many.\n\n1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:58.020\n Is there something you wish you could have done differently?\n\n1:48:58.020 --> 1:49:00.600\n Like if you could go back to do one thing differently\n\n1:49:00.600 --> 1:49:01.820\n or that it regrets all of it.\n\n1:49:01.820 --> 1:49:02.660\n Did you ask Musk this?\n\n1:49:02.660 --> 1:49:04.040\n I'm curious.\n\n1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:04.880\n What did he say?\n\n1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:07.220\n Offline all the time.\n\n1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:11.520\n No, no.\n\n1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:12.680\n You'd be curious to know.\n\n1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:13.960\n And he's an engineer too\n\n1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:17.360\n and engineers really value mistakes.\n\n1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:18.200\n Engineers value mistakes.\n\n1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.600\n Value mistakes and errors\n\n1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:22.400\n because that's an opportunity to learn.\n\n1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:24.120\n I mean, this is what you do with systems\n\n1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:26.520\n is you test them, then test them, then test them\n\n1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.560\n and errors is just information.\n\n1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:29.400\n He did that with the rockets.\n\n1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:31.240\n That is true in its way of filmmaking.\n\n1:49:31.240 --> 1:49:35.240\n There are certain things you learn as you build films\n\n1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:36.720\n and you make mistakes.\n\n1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:39.600\n It's like putting an engine together and you,\n\n1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:42.260\n oh, the film is flawed in that way, you know it.\n\n1:49:42.260 --> 1:49:43.880\n Other people may or may not see it,\n\n1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:48.260\n but the car runs or it made money or it didn't make money.\n\n1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:49.900\n It can be good and it didn't make money,\n\n1:49:49.900 --> 1:49:53.120\n but the point is that everything is a build.\n\n1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:54.800\n Every film is a construction.\n\n1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:57.540\n Same thing as he goes through on a Tesla,\n\n1:49:57.540 --> 1:49:59.480\n we go through on each film.\n\n1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:03.100\n But films are art.\n\n1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:03.940\n It's a little tricky.\n\n1:50:03.940 --> 1:50:05.760\n Yeah, the thing is one film does not lead\n\n1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.820\n to a lifetime guarantee of copyright.\n\n1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:16.580\n Well, yeah, you have the movie game as you've called it.\n\n1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:17.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:22.640\n It's a complicated and cruel game.\n\n1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:24.920\n But it takes enormous amount of work,\n\n1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:26.520\n enormous amount of work to make a film.\n\n1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:28.800\n People underestimate that.\n\n1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:33.600\n It's extremely complicated to have something be successful\n\n1:50:34.900 --> 1:50:38.200\n because it has so many elements of luck involved\n\n1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:42.000\n and reception and so forth.\n\n1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.280\n What do you think, I apologize for the absurd question,\n\n1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:48.520\n but what do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.280\n Why are we here?\n\n1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:51.100\n The why.\n\n1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:52.320\n I think to realize ourselves,\n\n1:50:52.320 --> 1:50:54.700\n to realize more of what you are,\n\n1:50:54.700 --> 1:50:57.700\n to realize what life is, to appreciate it,\n\n1:50:57.700 --> 1:51:01.040\n to grow, to honor our life,\n\n1:51:01.040 --> 1:51:02.580\n to honor the concept of life\n\n1:51:02.580 --> 1:51:04.600\n and to understand how precious life is.\n\n1:51:06.180 --> 1:51:08.880\n The preciousness of life, as the Buddhists say.\n\n1:51:08.880 --> 1:51:12.360\n And of course, the immediacy of death all around us.\n\n1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:14.820\n The causes of death are all around us.\n\n1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:18.600\n And our life is like, as they say,\n\n1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:23.600\n is like a lantern in a strong breeze existing\n\n1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:25.600\n among the causes of death.\n\n1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:27.520\n So life is so precious.\n\n1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:31.080\n And at the same time, the immediacy of death\n\n1:51:31.080 --> 1:51:33.160\n and then of course, the continuation of life\n\n1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:35.020\n in whatever form it's gonna take.\n\n1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:40.200\n But in this life, to wake up to the preciousness of it.\n\n1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:41.080\n To the preciousness.\n\n1:51:41.080 --> 1:51:42.480\n Yeah, that's a wonderful thing, by the way.\n\n1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:43.800\n I didn't have that when I was young.\n\n1:51:43.800 --> 1:51:44.900\n I took it for granted.\n\n1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:49.840\n Oliver, like I said, I'm a huge fan.\n\n1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:51.760\n You're an incredible human being,\n\n1:51:51.760 --> 1:51:53.900\n one of the greatest artists ever.\n\n1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:57.320\n So it's a huge honor that you sit with me\n\n1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.720\n and talk so deeply and honestly\n\n1:52:00.720 --> 1:52:02.480\n about some very difficult topics.\n\n1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:05.180\n Again, you're an inspiration and it's an honor\n\n1:52:05.180 --> 1:52:06.840\n that you will spend your valuable time with me.\n\n1:52:06.840 --> 1:52:07.680\n Thank you very much.\n\n1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:08.520\n Thanks for talking to me.\n\n1:52:08.520 --> 1:52:10.000\n Fun being here.\n\n1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.640\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Oliver Stone.\n\n1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:13.920\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:16.280\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:52:16.280 --> 1:52:18.360\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n1:52:18.360 --> 1:52:20.560\n from Oliver Stone in the untold history\n\n1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:22.560\n of the United States.\n\n1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.720\n To fail is not tragic.\n\n1:52:24.720 --> 1:52:26.440\n To be human is.\n\n1:52:26.440 --> 1:52:53.440\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
