the 14th Amendment.\n\n00:06.360 --> 00:07.900\n I hate it.\n\n00:07.900 --> 00:09.880\n The hatred comes from an understanding\n\n00:09.880 --> 00:12.400\n that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute\n\n00:12.400 --> 00:14.760\n for the actual development of the capacities\n\n00:14.760 --> 00:16.520\n of our people to compete.\n\n00:16.520 --> 00:19.400\n They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.\n\n00:20.320 --> 00:22.200\n We're gonna have a separate program for you.\n\n00:22.200 --> 00:25.000\n We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.\n\n00:25.000 --> 00:27.280\n That doesn't make us any smarter.\n\n00:27.280 --> 00:30.240\n It doesn't make us any more creative\n\n00:30.240 --> 00:34.000\n and it doesn't make us any more fit\n\n00:34.000 --> 00:37.320\n for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.\n\n00:39.600 --> 00:42.080\n The following is a conversation with Glenn Loury,\n\n00:42.080 --> 00:44.200\n professor of economics and social sciences\n\n00:44.200 --> 00:45.480\n at Brown University.\n\n00:45.480 --> 00:49.540\n He is one of the great minds and communicators of our time,\n\n00:49.540 --> 00:53.480\n writing and speaking about race and inequality.\n\n00:53.480 --> 00:56.280\n I highly encourage you to listen to his show\n\n00:56.280 --> 01:00.120\n on YouTube and Substack, simply called The Glenn Show.\n\n01:01.000 --> 01:02.920\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.\n\n01:02.920 --> 01:04.960\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:04.960 --> 01:06.080\n in the description.\n\n01:06.080 --> 01:09.400\n And now, dear friends, here's Glenn Loury.\n\n01:10.320 --> 01:12.960\n Martin Luther King Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech\n\n01:12.960 --> 01:15.480\n I think is the greatest speech in American history.\n\n01:15.480 --> 01:17.760\n If I may, I'd like to read a few words of it.\n\n01:17.760 --> 01:18.600\n Sure.\n\n01:18.600 --> 01:21.160\n And ask you a question about this dream.\n\n01:21.160 --> 01:26.160\n I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up\n\n01:26.280 --> 01:28.980\n and live out the true meaning of its creed.\n\n01:28.980 --> 01:31.640\n We hold these truths to be self evident,\n\n01:31.640 --> 01:33.480\n that all men are created equal.\n\n01:34.640 --> 01:38.920\n I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,\n\n01:38.920 --> 01:41.800\n the sons of former slaves and the sons of former\n\n01:41.800 --> 01:44.600\n slave owners will be able to sit down together\n\n01:44.600 --> 01:46.000\n at the table of brotherhood.\n\n01:47.040 --> 01:50.840\n I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,\n\n01:50.840 --> 01:54.160\n a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,\n\n01:54.160 --> 01:56.600\n sweltering with the heat of oppression,\n\n01:56.600 --> 02:00.840\n will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n\n02:00.840 --> 02:04.320\n I have a dream that my four little children\n\n02:04.320 --> 02:08.000\n will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged\n\n02:08.000 --> 02:09.800\n by the color of their skin,\n\n02:09.800 --> 02:12.540\n but by the content of their character.\n\n02:12.540 --> 02:14.720\n I have a dream today.\n\n02:14.720 --> 02:16.360\n First of all, damn.\n\n02:16.360 --> 02:19.560\n I mentioned to you offline I immigrated to America\n\n02:19.560 --> 02:20.920\n and this is why I love this country.\n\n02:20.920 --> 02:23.160\n This is one of the great speeches that represents\n\n02:23.160 --> 02:25.040\n what this country is about.\n\n02:25.040 --> 02:28.400\n So what is this ideal of equality\n\n02:29.260 --> 02:31.360\n that we should strive for as a nation,\n\n02:31.360 --> 02:33.440\n that all men are created equal?\n\n02:33.440 --> 02:35.720\n What does that mean to you, this equality?\n\n02:37.400 --> 02:41.800\n Well, if we put this in historical context,\n\n02:43.080 --> 02:47.280\n King is speaking in 1963 when he gives that speech.\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:52.280\n It's exactly 100 years after Abraham Lincoln signs\n\n02:53.060 --> 02:55.600\n the Emancipation Proclamation\n\n02:55.600 --> 03:00.600\n declaring the enslaved people to be free.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:05.960\n They're not yet citizens in 1863,\n\n03:07.040 --> 03:10.500\n but the end of slavery has become the position\n\n03:10.500 --> 03:13.400\n of the federal government when Lincoln issues\n\n03:13.400 --> 03:17.320\n that Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n03:17.320 --> 03:22.000\n So putting it in context, enslaved people,\n\n03:22.000 --> 03:27.000\n four million or so African descended enslaved people,\n\n03:28.280 --> 03:31.120\n how do they become citizens?\n\n03:31.120 --> 03:36.120\n How do they become in this status of subjugation\n\n03:38.280 --> 03:42.240\n and domination and stigma and exclusion?\n\n03:42.240 --> 03:44.320\n How do they become citizens?\n\n03:44.320 --> 03:48.840\n It seems to me that that's the heart of it.\n\n03:48.840 --> 03:53.120\n The equality that King is talking about\n\n03:53.120 --> 03:58.120\n is an equality of status as members of the nation\n\n03:59.220 --> 04:03.600\n as free and equal citizens within the republic.\n\n04:04.660 --> 04:07.500\n Now, I think it's really important to understand\n\n04:07.500 --> 04:12.500\n that slavery was not merely a legal order,\n\n04:13.880 --> 04:18.320\n but it was also a social system\n\n04:18.320 --> 04:22.840\n that had the symbolism attached to it.\n\n04:22.840 --> 04:25.640\n They had a big journey to make\n\n04:25.640 --> 04:30.640\n from their subjugated status as serfs, as landless people,\n\n04:30.840 --> 04:33.820\n as uneducated, unfit for citizenship really\n\n04:33.820 --> 04:35.680\n in the minds of many.\n\n04:35.680 --> 04:40.680\n So I think that's what in 1963, 100 years later,\n\n04:42.160 --> 04:45.040\n that King is appealing to this idea\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:50.040\n that when Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence\n\n04:50.840 --> 04:54.480\n writes these words, all men are created equal\n\n04:54.480 --> 04:56.040\n and endowed by their creator\n\n04:56.040 --> 04:59.000\n with certain inalienable rights,\n\n04:59.000 --> 05:04.000\n Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, didn't have in mind\n\n05:05.680 --> 05:09.240\n when he wrote those words, the people who were slaves.\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:13.400\n But by the time you get to 1963,\n\n05:13.400 --> 05:18.400\n King is invoking this idea, all men,\n\n05:19.120 --> 05:20.560\n and of course he means all persons.\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:23.240\n He doesn't only mean men.\n\n05:23.240 --> 05:25.520\n He means men and women are created equal.\n\n05:25.520 --> 05:30.520\n He wants this idea to be embraced by the country\n\n05:30.840 --> 05:35.040\n in reference to the descendants of the African slaves.\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:35.880\n That's his dream.\n\n05:35.880 --> 05:37.160\n That's his idea.\n\n05:37.160 --> 05:39.980\n The legacy of slavery would be erased,\n\n05:41.160 --> 05:46.160\n that the position of African Americans would be equalized\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:48.980\n within the political community,\n\n05:48.980 --> 05:51.760\n which is the United States of America.\n\n05:51.760 --> 05:53.680\n That's my sense of it in any case.\n\n05:53.680 --> 05:58.320\n So on a very basic level, the worth of a human being\n\n05:58.320 --> 05:59.160\n is equal.\n\n05:59.160 --> 06:02.640\n It's just literally the worth of a human being.\n\n06:02.640 --> 06:03.920\n So I mentioned to you offline\n\n06:03.920 --> 06:06.840\n that I came from the Soviet Union.\n\n06:06.840 --> 06:10.920\n My grandfather fought in World War II,\n\n06:10.920 --> 06:15.920\n and for Hitler, the worth of a Slavic person\n\n06:17.640 --> 06:21.100\n as they were captured, there's different numbers,\n\n06:21.100 --> 06:24.000\n but it's in the hundreds to one German\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:29.000\n in terms of the value of the person to the great Germany.\n\n06:30.080 --> 06:32.040\n So he wanted Germany to expand\n\n06:32.040 --> 06:34.400\n and conquer a large part of the world.\n\n06:34.400 --> 06:37.680\n And within that future world, that Third Reich,\n\n06:37.680 --> 06:41.880\n the worth of a Russian or a Slavic person\n\n06:41.880 --> 06:45.920\n is one hundredth or one thousandth of a German person,\n\n06:45.920 --> 06:47.680\n of a pure German person.\n\n06:47.680 --> 06:51.140\n So that has to do with not some kind of public policy\n\n06:51.140 --> 06:53.400\n or politics or all that kind of stuff.\n\n06:53.400 --> 06:56.440\n It has to do with the basic worth of a human being.\n\n06:56.440 --> 06:58.760\n And that's what Dr. King is speaking to,\n\n06:58.760 --> 07:03.560\n that all people on some kind of deep level\n\n07:03.560 --> 07:05.600\n are worth the same.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:10.800\n If you're somehow weighing the value of a person,\n\n07:10.800 --> 07:14.760\n we're equal in that basic fundamental worth.\n\n07:14.760 --> 07:16.480\n Yeah, I think that's correct.\n\n07:16.480 --> 07:18.480\n I think that's very well said.\n\n07:18.480 --> 07:20.000\n I don't know that he had in mind\n\n07:20.000 --> 07:23.600\n the position of Slavic people in Central Europe\n\n07:23.600 --> 07:25.280\n in the middle of the 20th century,\n\n07:25.280 --> 07:27.880\n or the first part of the 20th century, King.\n\n07:27.880 --> 07:29.400\n I don't know that he had that in mind.\n\n07:29.400 --> 07:31.440\n He might well have done.\n\n07:31.440 --> 07:34.120\n But certainly that's the idea.\n\n07:34.120 --> 07:35.960\n So you don't think he was really thinking\n\n07:35.960 --> 07:40.480\n about this particular civil rights struggle\n\n07:40.480 --> 07:42.800\n and the particular struggle\n\n07:42.800 --> 07:47.800\n against the backdrop of the history of slavery in America\n\n07:47.880 --> 07:49.600\n and thinking about African Americans.\n\n07:49.600 --> 07:52.160\n He wasn't thinking about the basic,\n\n07:52.160 --> 07:55.160\n he wasn't speaking to the basic worth of all human beings.\n\n07:55.160 --> 07:56.860\n No, I don't mean to say that.\n\n07:56.860 --> 08:00.320\n The speech in Washington.\n\n08:00.320 --> 08:01.160\n The dream.\n\n08:01.160 --> 08:06.160\n In 1963 at that march was within the context\n\n08:07.320 --> 08:08.400\n of the United States.\n\n08:08.400 --> 08:12.360\n And it was within the context of the civil rights movement.\n\n08:12.360 --> 08:14.280\n There was a movement that was going on.\n\n08:15.760 --> 08:20.760\n He was an actor in a political drama that was American\n\n08:21.640 --> 08:26.400\n that had to do with the fight over equal rights\n\n08:26.400 --> 08:30.960\n for voting, for housing, for employment,\n\n08:30.960 --> 08:34.720\n for citizenship of blacks in America.\n\n08:34.720 --> 08:37.680\n But King was informed, I think,\n\n08:37.680 --> 08:42.680\n by a much broader Christian ethic of the equality\n\n08:43.120 --> 08:44.480\n of all persons.\n\n08:44.480 --> 08:47.240\n I mean, he gets killed in 1968.\n\n08:48.120 --> 08:51.560\n The five years after that speech in Washington,\n\n08:51.560 --> 08:56.560\n he spends developing his worldview\n\n08:57.280 --> 09:01.200\n and the things that he had to say, for example,\n\n09:01.200 --> 09:03.980\n about the war in Southeast Asia that was going on\n\n09:03.980 --> 09:08.980\n at that time made appeals to universal principles\n\n09:10.600 --> 09:11.440\n of equality.\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:13.760\n He was a pacifist to some degree.\n\n09:13.760 --> 09:15.640\n He was against war.\n\n09:15.640 --> 09:18.680\n He was a socialist to some degree.\n\n09:18.680 --> 09:22.000\n He might not have worn that label publicly,\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:25.060\n but he believed in a decent society\n\n09:25.060 --> 09:27.760\n where the poor would not go untended,\n\n09:27.760 --> 09:30.860\n where healthcare would be available to people who needed it\n\n09:30.860 --> 09:32.640\n and this kind of thing.\n\n09:32.640 --> 09:37.040\n A humanitarian who saw that the value of a life\n\n09:37.040 --> 09:40.300\n was not dependent upon the color of the skin,\n\n09:40.300 --> 09:43.900\n upon the native mother tongue that might be spoken,\n\n09:44.760 --> 09:46.920\n upon whether male or female.\n\n09:48.360 --> 09:50.040\n All persons are created equal.\n\n09:50.040 --> 09:55.040\n This is very much the ethic of Martin Luther King,\n\n09:55.240 --> 09:56.860\n on my understanding.\n\n09:56.860 --> 10:01.440\n Broadly speaking, what do you learn about human nature\n\n10:01.440 --> 10:05.320\n by looking at the history of slavery in America?\n\n10:07.560 --> 10:08.400\n Oh my.\n\n10:08.400 --> 10:10.640\n So what does that tell you about people?\n\n10:10.640 --> 10:14.160\n Well, I think of two things right off the top of my head.\n\n10:15.080 --> 10:20.080\n One is about the capacity of people\n\n10:22.480 --> 10:27.480\n for looking the other way in the face of\n\n10:27.480 --> 10:32.480\n unethical and morally profoundly problematic practice.\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:40.000\n So, I mean, slavery was controversial.\n\n10:40.000 --> 10:42.680\n It was controversial going all the way back\n\n10:42.680 --> 10:44.720\n to the founding of the United States of America.\n\n10:44.720 --> 10:47.840\n The country was founded on a compromise\n\n10:47.840 --> 10:52.840\n where half of the country thought that slavery was abhorrent\n\n10:52.840 --> 10:57.840\n and would not have had it countenanced in the Constitution.\n\n10:59.280 --> 11:02.120\n The other half of the country were steeped\n\n11:02.120 --> 11:07.120\n in the dependence on the labor of these African captives\n\n11:07.160 --> 11:08.740\n and their descendants.\n\n11:08.740 --> 11:10.440\n The economy depended upon it.\n\n11:10.440 --> 11:11.760\n They owned them as property.\n\n11:11.760 --> 11:12.760\n That was their wealth.\n\n11:12.760 --> 11:14.660\n Their wealth was invested to some degree\n\n11:14.660 --> 11:17.680\n in the value of these human beings.\n\n11:17.680 --> 11:20.440\n And in order for the United States to come together\n\n11:20.440 --> 11:24.220\n as a confederation of the several colonies,\n\n11:24.220 --> 11:25.940\n there had to be a compromise made.\n\n11:25.940 --> 11:30.280\n And it was made where slavery was allowed to persist\n\n11:31.480 --> 11:35.500\n and the people who were against it\n\n11:35.500 --> 11:38.880\n or who thought it morally problematic\n\n11:38.880 --> 11:42.120\n were able to countenance the practice\n\n11:42.120 --> 11:45.540\n in the Southern states where slavery flourished.\n\n11:45.540 --> 11:47.500\n And that went on for 75 years\n\n11:47.500 --> 11:49.640\n after the founding of the country\n\n11:49.640 --> 11:53.320\n until the crisis of the late 1850s\n\n11:53.320 --> 11:55.240\n that led to the Civil War\n\n11:55.240 --> 11:56.920\n and ultimately to the emancipation.\n\n11:56.920 --> 12:00.200\n So one thing I think about human nature\n\n12:00.200 --> 12:05.200\n from the fact of slavery is that the ability of people\n\n12:05.680 --> 12:10.680\n to live with terrible, morally questionable practices\n\n12:11.440 --> 12:14.360\n and have that as a part of their institutions.\n\n12:14.360 --> 12:19.360\n It took a movement, a massive movement of abolitionists\n\n12:20.360 --> 12:24.880\n struggling against slavery for the better part of a century\n\n12:24.880 --> 12:29.880\n before that practice could be eradicated.\n\n12:29.880 --> 12:34.400\n But the other thing about human nature that I see\n\n12:34.400 --> 12:39.280\n is the ability of people to sustain their humanity\n\n12:39.280 --> 12:44.280\n under the most awful, oppressive conditions.\n\n12:44.880 --> 12:49.800\n The enslaved persons, the slaves and their children,\n\n12:49.800 --> 12:51.480\n I mean, they were chattel,\n\n12:51.480 --> 12:55.180\n they were bought and sold like horses or cattle.\n\n12:56.320 --> 13:01.320\n And yet their humanity was not destroyed by that.\n\n13:01.920 --> 13:06.920\n And they were able to sustain their dignity to some degree\n\n13:06.920 --> 13:11.160\n in such a manner that once emancipation finally did arrive,\n\n13:11.160 --> 13:16.160\n the freedmen and women, the persons who had been enslaved\n\n13:16.160 --> 13:21.160\n and who were set free were able to over the following decades\n\n13:25.800 --> 13:30.800\n build a foundation for the development of African Americans\n\n13:30.800 --> 13:34.040\n within the context of American society\n\n13:34.040 --> 13:39.040\n that eventually culminated in the civil rights movement\n\n13:39.400 --> 13:41.900\n of the middle of the 20th century\n\n13:41.900 --> 13:44.820\n and has led us into the present day.\n\n13:45.720 --> 13:50.720\n So, you know, human nature can countenance awful evil\n\n13:53.340 --> 13:55.560\n but human nature can also survive\n\n13:55.560 --> 13:58.240\n in the face of terrible evil.\n\n13:58.240 --> 14:00.320\n That's what I take from slavery.\n\n14:00.320 --> 14:05.320\n That survival, that flame can burn even when the world\n\n14:05.960 --> 14:07.960\n around it tries to put it out.\n\n14:07.960 --> 14:11.640\n There's still a little flame of human consciousness,\n\n14:11.640 --> 14:16.560\n of spirit, of culture, of whatever the hell that is\n\n14:16.560 --> 14:19.640\n that makes humans flourish and makes humans beautiful\n\n14:19.640 --> 14:21.080\n that lives on.\n\n14:21.080 --> 14:22.000\n That's very well said.\n\n14:22.000 --> 14:23.980\n Yeah, I think you put it very well.\n\n14:23.980 --> 14:28.060\n There's gotta be some poetic way of expressing that.\n\n14:28.060 --> 14:28.900\n Oh.\n\n14:29.740 --> 14:30.860\n Leave it to the poets.\n\n14:31.820 --> 14:34.420\n What about the people that look the other way?\n\n14:34.420 --> 14:37.980\n How many people do you think, just regular people,\n\n14:37.980 --> 14:40.740\n knew that something is, this is wrong?\n\n14:40.740 --> 14:44.700\n Or do people through generations convince themselves,\n\n14:44.700 --> 14:46.820\n most people, most regular people,\n\n14:46.820 --> 14:49.540\n convince themselves that there's nothing wrong?\n\n14:52.540 --> 14:53.620\n Yeah.\n\n14:53.620 --> 14:55.700\n I ask this question because I wonder\n\n14:55.700 --> 14:59.780\n what we're looking the other way on today also.\n\n14:59.780 --> 15:04.780\n Because you have to ask yourself these difficult questions\n\n15:05.260 --> 15:10.260\n of assuming we're the same people we were back then\n\n15:10.860 --> 15:14.180\n then we can be flawed in that same kind of way.\n\n15:14.180 --> 15:18.480\n We can look the other way just as others have in history.\n\n15:20.100 --> 15:24.060\n Yeah, you spoke of the European context\n\n15:24.060 --> 15:28.820\n and of the Nazis and certainly a lot of people\n\n15:28.820 --> 15:33.020\n had to be looking the other way when the massive crimes\n\n15:33.020 --> 15:36.060\n that were committed by that regime were being undertaken.\n\n15:36.060 --> 15:39.940\n I mean, railroad cars full of human beings\n\n15:39.940 --> 15:43.620\n being taken off to be slaughtered or to be worked to death\n\n15:43.620 --> 15:48.180\n in labor camps or to be gassed, et cetera.\n\n15:48.180 --> 15:50.760\n A lot of people had to know about what was going on\n\n15:50.760 --> 15:55.760\n and look the other way or enthusiastically supported\n\n15:55.900 --> 16:00.900\n the persecution of the Jews and the gypsies and so on.\n\n16:01.900 --> 16:05.860\n And I don't know, I wasn't around in 1840.\n\n16:05.860 --> 16:09.980\n My sense of the matter is that like many practices\n\n16:09.980 --> 16:12.660\n that are unjust, most people thought\n\n16:12.660 --> 16:14.060\n that's just the way it is.\n\n16:14.060 --> 16:16.580\n I mean, that's the world that they inherited.\n\n16:16.580 --> 16:20.260\n They were not moralists, they were not revolutionaries.\n\n16:20.260 --> 16:22.980\n They just wanted to go along.\n\n16:22.980 --> 16:24.680\n Some people might've been troubled by it\n\n16:24.680 --> 16:26.460\n but thought there's nothing that can be done.\n\n16:26.460 --> 16:28.340\n Some people might've thought, well,\n\n16:28.340 --> 16:32.780\n they're these black Africans, they're not really like us\n\n16:32.780 --> 16:35.160\n and they are lucky to be here.\n\n16:35.160 --> 16:38.460\n If they were in Africa, they'd be worse off still.\n\n16:38.460 --> 16:40.820\n Some people might've thought that.\n\n16:40.820 --> 16:42.220\n Some people might've been disturbed\n\n16:42.220 --> 16:44.940\n but not been able to see what it is\n\n16:44.940 --> 16:46.380\n that they could do about it.\n\n16:46.380 --> 16:51.380\n They might've thought, oh, this is disgusting.\n\n16:51.460 --> 16:56.180\n This is not something I would wanna have anything to do with\n\n16:56.180 --> 17:01.180\n but not knowing whether there's any practical way\n\n17:01.540 --> 17:05.540\n of opposing it, that's why you need a movement.\n\n17:05.540 --> 17:10.540\n You need for the people who are troubled by the practice\n\n17:10.620 --> 17:12.980\n to know that there are others like themselves\n\n17:12.980 --> 17:16.820\n equally troubled and as they gather together,\n\n17:16.820 --> 17:20.740\n collectively, they can exert their influence.\n\n17:20.740 --> 17:24.580\n I mean, debates about the wrongness of slavery,\n\n17:24.580 --> 17:28.580\n as I say, go all the way back to the founding of the country.\n\n17:28.580 --> 17:30.740\n There were abolitionists and there were people\n\n17:30.740 --> 17:35.740\n who opposed the compromise that led to the framing documents\n\n17:36.940 --> 17:40.780\n and institutions that created the United States of America,\n\n17:40.780 --> 17:45.780\n opposed the countenancing of slavery in that situation.\n\n17:47.540 --> 17:52.260\n But it took a while before that could come to a head\n\n17:52.260 --> 17:56.660\n and produce the crisis which ultimately led\n\n17:56.660 --> 17:59.480\n to the eradication of slavery.\n\n17:59.480 --> 18:04.480\n I would note that slavery is not unique to the United States.\n\n18:05.380 --> 18:08.560\n It's not unique to the Western Hemisphere.\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:13.220\n The enslavement of people, the trafficking in human chattel\n\n18:14.380 --> 18:18.100\n is something that one sees on a global basis,\n\n18:18.100 --> 18:22.200\n one sees it going all the way back to antiquity.\n\n18:22.200 --> 18:26.860\n So we might ask, how is it that people finally came\n\n18:26.860 --> 18:30.260\n to turn their backs and eradicate the practice?\n\n18:30.260 --> 18:33.860\n That might be the thing worth really trying to understand\n\n18:33.860 --> 18:36.060\n because the practice itself is,\n\n18:36.060 --> 18:40.540\n there's a wonderful book by the sociologist\n\n18:40.540 --> 18:45.540\n Orlando Patterson called Slavery and Social Death\n\n18:46.100 --> 18:51.100\n that was published in 1982, which is a comprehensive history\n\n18:51.940 --> 18:55.700\n and social analysis of the institution of slavery\n\n18:55.700 --> 19:00.700\n over 2,500 years, going back to the classical Greek\n\n19:00.700 --> 19:05.700\n and Roman civilizations, finding slavery in Africa\n\n19:06.500 --> 19:09.980\n amongst Africans, finding slavery in the Middle East,\n\n19:09.980 --> 19:11.800\n finding slavery in the Far East,\n\n19:11.800 --> 19:16.580\n finding slavery in South Asia, the enslavement of people,\n\n19:16.580 --> 19:19.640\n the practice of taking someone as a captive in war\n\n19:19.640 --> 19:22.500\n and then instead of killing them, which you could do,\n\n19:22.500 --> 19:27.500\n making them into your property was very, very widespread\n\n19:27.500 --> 19:30.580\n in human culture.\n\n19:30.580 --> 19:33.340\n So I mean, I'd like to make this point sometimes\n\n19:33.340 --> 19:36.420\n when people are talking about how wrong slavery was\n\n19:36.420 --> 19:38.700\n and I agree without any question\n\n19:40.020 --> 19:44.540\n that the practice was profoundly morally problematic,\n\n19:46.380 --> 19:50.400\n but I'd like to make the point that given how wrong it was,\n\n19:50.400 --> 19:55.400\n think about how impressive was the accomplishment\n\n19:55.400 --> 19:58.080\n of the eradication of slavery.\n\n19:58.080 --> 20:01.520\n Now, that was something, I mean, there were 600,000 dead\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:06.180\n in the war between the states, 1861 to 1865\n\n20:06.180 --> 20:08.300\n in a country of 30 million people.\n\n20:08.300 --> 20:13.300\n That's a lot of dead people who gave their lives\n\n20:13.920 --> 20:16.760\n not to eradicate slavery in every instance,\n\n20:16.760 --> 20:20.040\n probably most of them were just fighting for,\n\n20:21.360 --> 20:25.280\n they enlisted or were conscripted into the forces\n\n20:25.280 --> 20:27.160\n and they fought and they died,\n\n20:27.160 --> 20:30.520\n but the net effect of their having fought and died\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:32.960\n was to push along a process\n\n20:32.960 --> 20:34.880\n that led to the eradication of slavery.\n\n20:34.880 --> 20:36.840\n That's an amazing achievement.\n\n20:37.840 --> 20:42.840\n The slaves themselves were largely uneducated\n\n20:43.840 --> 20:47.080\n and backward in their,\n\n20:47.080 --> 20:48.800\n of course, what else could they have been?\n\n20:48.800 --> 20:50.780\n They were kept in captivity,\n\n20:50.780 --> 20:55.040\n they were prevented from developing their human potential\n\n20:55.040 --> 20:58.720\n and yet after the end of slavery,\n\n20:58.720 --> 21:03.320\n that population, that 4 million plus African descended people\n\n21:04.440 --> 21:08.120\n became the foundation for what a century later\n\n21:08.120 --> 21:12.600\n leads to Martin Luther King standing in the Washington Mall\n\n21:12.600 --> 21:14.440\n and giving that great speech\n\n21:14.440 --> 21:18.280\n and now here we are 150 years down the road\n\n21:18.280 --> 21:21.600\n and Barack Obama is president of the United States.\n\n21:21.600 --> 21:23.260\n Now, he did not descend from slaves,\n\n21:23.260 --> 21:25.640\n I think we must not lose track of that,\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:29.280\n but he identified as an African American\n\n21:29.280 --> 21:32.560\n and was a part of the population\n\n21:32.560 --> 21:35.840\n that consisted largely of people who descended from slaves\n\n21:36.880 --> 21:40.880\n and we are, we African Americans are\n\n21:40.880 --> 21:42.960\n for all practical purposes,\n\n21:42.960 --> 21:46.720\n fully equal citizens of this great republic.\n\n21:46.720 --> 21:49.400\n That has happened within a century and a half\n\n21:49.400 --> 21:52.200\n and I don't know that you can find any parallel\n\n21:52.200 --> 21:55.900\n to that kind of transformation in the status of people\n\n21:56.800 --> 22:01.800\n from human chattel to full citizens of the republic.\n\n22:01.800 --> 22:02.920\n Anywhere in human history,\n\n22:02.920 --> 22:07.240\n it's certainly worth celebrating the achievement\n\n22:07.240 --> 22:10.160\n of the eradication of slavery, I would say.\n\n22:10.160 --> 22:13.360\n And it probably started with a few people\n\n22:14.560 --> 22:18.880\n that inside their mind dared to rebel.\n\n22:18.880 --> 22:22.200\n You know, it's interesting to think about how it all started,\n\n22:23.320 --> 22:26.920\n how in the state of injustice,\n\n22:26.920 --> 22:31.920\n the revolution percolates, like where it starts.\n\n22:32.820 --> 22:36.560\n You said people that see something is wrong find each other.\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:43.000\n It's in the ideas of charismatic individuals\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:44.920\n that not only know that something is wrong,\n\n22:44.920 --> 22:49.920\n but are able to tell others about it and be convincing\n\n22:51.680 --> 22:54.760\n and then together gather and rise up.\n\n22:54.760 --> 22:58.320\n It's interesting to make this kind of incredible progress\n\n22:58.320 --> 23:00.440\n from slavery to where we are today\n\n23:00.440 --> 23:04.300\n to live out the ideal of this all men are created equal.\n\n23:06.160 --> 23:06.980\n Yeah.\n\n23:06.980 --> 23:07.820\n The power of individual,\n\n23:07.820 --> 23:10.020\n because I don't know what you think about it,\n\n23:10.020 --> 23:14.600\n but I tend to think that a few small individuals\n\n23:14.600 --> 23:16.320\n probably originated this.\n\n23:16.320 --> 23:18.280\n Like it's the power of the individual,\n\n23:18.280 --> 23:20.320\n because sometimes we think there's injustice in the world,\n\n23:20.320 --> 23:22.160\n what can I possibly do?\n\n23:22.160 --> 23:26.400\n But I tend to think one person can be the seed\n\n23:26.400 --> 23:29.200\n of starting to fix the injustice.\n\n23:29.200 --> 23:30.040\n Sure.\n\n23:31.080 --> 23:33.280\n One person here, one person there.\n\n23:34.360 --> 23:35.200\n Yeah.\n\n23:36.040 --> 23:38.960\n One thinks of course of Frederick Douglass,\n\n23:38.960 --> 23:43.960\n this massively significant figure who was born in slavery,\n\n23:46.200 --> 23:51.200\n who stole his freedom because he was property\n\n23:52.240 --> 23:54.720\n and he decided he was not gonna be property anymore\n\n23:54.720 --> 23:59.040\n and he took it unto himself to emancipate himself personally\n\n23:59.040 --> 24:04.040\n and who became an educated, a powerfully articulate,\n\n24:04.040 --> 24:09.040\n massively influential person in the United States\n\n24:09.400 --> 24:14.400\n and in England going around presenting himself\n\n24:14.880 --> 24:18.800\n as an embodiment of human dignity\n\n24:18.800 --> 24:23.800\n and commitment to ideals of equality.\n\n24:24.320 --> 24:27.680\n And I mean, he's just one person,\n\n24:27.680 --> 24:30.200\n but there were others like him.\n\n24:30.200 --> 24:31.960\n Just one person.\n\n24:31.960 --> 24:33.560\n All it takes is just one person.\n\n24:33.560 --> 24:38.560\n So here we are on this topic of equality\n\n24:39.600 --> 24:43.000\n in the 21st century.\n\n24:43.000 --> 24:45.400\n So what does equality mean today?\n\n24:45.400 --> 24:50.400\n If you start to think about this idea of equality of outcome\n\n24:53.480 --> 24:56.720\n or the injustice of inequality,\n\n24:56.720 --> 25:01.040\n at which point does equality of outcome is just,\n\n25:01.040 --> 25:03.640\n at which point is it unjust?\n\n25:03.640 --> 25:05.640\n Sort of looking at our world today\n\n25:05.640 --> 25:07.680\n and looking at inequality,\n\n25:08.840 --> 25:13.840\n how do we know that some inequality is a sign of injustice\n\n25:14.320 --> 25:16.520\n and some is the way of life?\n\n25:16.520 --> 25:19.640\n So what does equality mean when we look at the world today,\n\n25:19.640 --> 25:23.320\n different from Dr. King's speech of the basic humanity?\n\n25:23.320 --> 25:27.800\n I don't think King's speech, I have a dream\n\n25:27.800 --> 25:29.960\n that one day my four little children will be judged\n\n25:29.960 --> 25:31.400\n not by the color of their skin,\n\n25:31.400 --> 25:33.320\n but by the content of their character\n\n25:34.440 --> 25:37.440\n requires equality of outcome.\n\n25:40.200 --> 25:42.080\n He says his children will be judged\n\n25:42.080 --> 25:44.600\n by the content of their character.\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:46.560\n That's a conditional statement.\n\n25:46.560 --> 25:49.840\n That is the judgment will depend upon the content\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:54.040\n of their character, not the color of their skin,\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:56.800\n but it doesn't follow from that,\n\n25:56.800 --> 26:01.560\n that the outcomes, whatever outcomes we consider wealth\n\n26:01.560 --> 26:03.120\n and economic power,\n\n26:05.320 --> 26:06.920\n position within the society,\n\n26:06.920 --> 26:10.240\n representation in the various professions,\n\n26:10.240 --> 26:13.000\n the various measures of social achievement\n\n26:13.000 --> 26:17.320\n doesn't follow from judging by the content of character\n\n26:17.320 --> 26:19.080\n and not color of skin,\n\n26:19.080 --> 26:21.400\n that when we look at the end of the day\n\n26:21.400 --> 26:24.120\n at the social outcomes that they will be equal\n\n26:24.120 --> 26:27.040\n across the different groups.\n\n26:27.040 --> 26:29.680\n In fact, I think there's a contradiction in the idea\n\n26:29.680 --> 26:31.840\n that groups will be equal\n\n26:31.840 --> 26:34.040\n in all of the various social outcomes,\n\n26:34.040 --> 26:36.960\n that they will be equally successful in business,\n\n26:36.960 --> 26:40.760\n that they will be proportionately represented\n\n26:40.760 --> 26:42.240\n in the various professions,\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:45.760\n that they will have the same educational achievement,\n\n26:45.760 --> 26:49.760\n that the occupational profiles will look the same.\n\n26:49.760 --> 26:53.080\n If they are, in fact, distinct groups\n\n26:53.080 --> 26:57.080\n with their own cultural traditions and practices,\n\n26:58.160 --> 27:00.840\n with their own ideals and norms,\n\n27:01.840 --> 27:04.240\n various immigrant populations,\n\n27:04.240 --> 27:06.480\n people coming to the United States of America\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:09.880\n from all corners of the world,\n\n27:09.880 --> 27:13.000\n the descendants of the African slaves,\n\n27:13.000 --> 27:15.600\n the black Americans here today,\n\n27:15.600 --> 27:19.520\n who are ourselves various with different backgrounds,\n\n27:19.520 --> 27:21.960\n different origins and so on,\n\n27:21.960 --> 27:25.320\n the different religious practices and commitments\n\n27:25.320 --> 27:30.320\n that Jewish or Mormon or Christian or whatever,\n\n27:32.760 --> 27:37.600\n however we parcel up the total population\n\n27:37.600 --> 27:38.760\n into the various groups,\n\n27:38.760 --> 27:42.800\n these groups are themselves different from one another.\n\n27:42.800 --> 27:45.240\n They have different norms\n\n27:45.240 --> 27:48.520\n within their own cultural practice.\n\n27:48.520 --> 27:49.760\n How would we expect,\n\n27:49.760 --> 27:51.480\n if in fact we recognize\n\n27:51.480 --> 27:54.400\n that the groups are different from one another,\n\n27:54.400 --> 27:56.720\n that in a world that is fair,\n\n27:56.720 --> 28:00.040\n they would all come out equally represented\n\n28:00.040 --> 28:00.960\n in every undertaking.\n\n28:00.960 --> 28:03.320\n They're not equally represented,\n\n28:03.320 --> 28:06.240\n and that fact, I'm arguing,\n\n28:06.240 --> 28:09.000\n is in and of itself insufficient\n\n28:09.000 --> 28:11.360\n to justify the conclusion\n\n28:11.360 --> 28:15.240\n that they're not somehow being fairly treated.\n\n28:15.240 --> 28:18.640\n Fair treatment doesn't imply equal outcomes\n\n28:18.640 --> 28:21.560\n in a world in which the populations in question\n\n28:21.560 --> 28:23.320\n are themselves different\n\n28:23.320 --> 28:25.440\n with respect to their culture, their practices,\n\n28:25.440 --> 28:27.640\n their norms, their traditions,\n\n28:27.640 --> 28:31.360\n their beliefs, their ideals, and so on.\n\n28:31.360 --> 28:35.200\n The fact of those different norms, traditions, beliefs,\n\n28:35.200 --> 28:37.200\n cultural orientations, and ideals\n\n28:37.200 --> 28:40.000\n will have consequences\n\n28:40.000 --> 28:44.000\n in terms of their different social outcomes.\n\n28:44.000 --> 28:46.160\n So I just think it's a mistake\n\n28:46.160 --> 28:47.800\n that people are making\n\n28:47.800 --> 28:48.800\n when they think\n\n28:49.920 --> 28:51.960\n fairness of treatment\n\n28:53.520 --> 28:56.000\n implies equality of outcomes.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:57.480\n It does not.\n\n28:57.480 --> 29:01.240\n Is the process by which we're speaking now\n\n29:02.600 --> 29:06.320\n in the midst of the National Basketball Association's\n\n29:06.320 --> 29:07.680\n playoffs,\n\n29:07.680 --> 29:10.440\n I confess to being a Boston Celtics fan.\n\n29:10.440 --> 29:12.560\n I mean, I'm just,\n\n29:12.560 --> 29:16.040\n it's a very good team, and I'm excited about my Celtics.\n\n29:16.040 --> 29:17.080\n We defeated\n\n29:18.240 --> 29:20.120\n the Brooklyn\n\n29:21.160 --> 29:22.440\n Nets.\n\n29:22.440 --> 29:25.480\n I mean, we defeated Kevin Durant\n\n29:25.480 --> 29:28.800\n and Kyrie Irving and company, okay,\n\n29:28.800 --> 29:31.240\n in a playoff series.\n\n29:31.240 --> 29:32.720\n We whipped them,\n\n29:32.720 --> 29:34.680\n and we're on our way to\n\n29:35.840 --> 29:37.840\n the Eastern Conference Finals,\n\n29:37.840 --> 29:39.800\n and we're on our way to the NBA Finals,\n\n29:39.800 --> 29:42.520\n and I'm, you know, if I were a betting man,\n\n29:42.520 --> 29:44.560\n I'd put down a few bucks\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:47.600\n that the Boston Celtics, underrated as we are,\n\n29:47.600 --> 29:50.680\n have a very good chance of winning the NBA Finals.\n\n29:50.680 --> 29:51.840\n Okay, so that's the NBA.\n\n29:51.840 --> 29:53.560\n That's the National Basketball Association.\n\n29:53.560 --> 29:54.400\n I'm a sports fan.\n\n29:54.400 --> 29:55.240\n I like basketball.\n\n29:55.240 --> 29:57.640\n Slightly biased prediction, but yes.\n\n29:57.640 --> 29:59.640\n Yeah, it is somewhat biased.\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:01.280\n All I'm saying is,\n\n30:01.280 --> 30:04.520\n if you take a look at who the star players are\n\n30:04.520 --> 30:06.160\n in the National Basketball Association,\n\n30:06.160 --> 30:09.480\n you're gonna find that there's some Eastern Europeans.\n\n30:09.480 --> 30:11.840\n You know, there's some really good basketball players\n\n30:11.840 --> 30:13.840\n coming out of Eastern Europe,\n\n30:15.160 --> 30:17.080\n and more power to them,\n\n30:17.080 --> 30:19.760\n and there are a lot of African Americans.\n\n30:19.760 --> 30:20.840\n We're overrepresented.\n\n30:22.120 --> 30:24.480\n There are not that many Jews, as far as I know.\n\n30:24.480 --> 30:26.480\n No offense intended there, Lex,\n\n30:26.480 --> 30:27.320\n but I mean,\n\n30:28.280 --> 30:31.040\n the NBA is not\n\n30:32.200 --> 30:34.120\n equally representative\n\n30:34.120 --> 30:37.480\n of all of the different populations in the United States.\n\n30:37.480 --> 30:39.120\n Now, we could go into the reasons why,\n\n30:39.120 --> 30:41.400\n but I'm just saying the process\n\n30:41.400 --> 30:44.600\n by which you get to be playing in the NBA is fair.\n\n30:44.600 --> 30:47.360\n If you can play, you can get on the court.\n\n30:48.560 --> 30:51.240\n All they're looking for is people who can play.\n\n30:51.240 --> 30:53.040\n I think something like that is true\n\n30:54.320 --> 30:56.080\n in many different venues.\n\n30:56.080 --> 31:01.080\n I expect, if you're a really good technical engineer,\n\n31:01.680 --> 31:03.160\n companies are gonna employ you,\n\n31:04.200 --> 31:07.320\n and if you can make money, they're gonna advance you,\n\n31:07.320 --> 31:12.240\n and you will be able to rise to the top of that profession.\n\n31:12.240 --> 31:15.400\n I expect that the people who are engaged\n\n31:15.400 --> 31:17.040\n in financial transactions,\n\n31:17.040 --> 31:20.120\n who are actually making bets on the market,\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:24.200\n by and large, are the people who are good at that activity,\n\n31:24.200 --> 31:26.200\n and if you're good at that activity in this world,\n\n31:26.200 --> 31:27.960\n in this modern world,\n\n31:27.960 --> 31:31.680\n you're gonna rise to the top.\n\n31:31.680 --> 31:36.680\n I'm not saying that there are no barriers of discrimination.\n\n31:37.680 --> 31:40.520\n Of course, there are of many different sorts,\n\n31:40.520 --> 31:43.560\n but I'm saying that to expect that there would be,\n\n31:43.560 --> 31:46.240\n okay, I mean, let's look at who's actually writing code.\n\n31:46.240 --> 31:48.440\n Let's look at who's actually trading bonds.\n\n31:48.440 --> 31:53.440\n Let's look at who's actually starting businesses and so on.\n\n31:53.960 --> 31:57.120\n To say that in a fair world,\n\n31:57.120 --> 31:59.960\n I would expect that if blacks are 10% of the population,\n\n31:59.960 --> 32:02.360\n they'd be 10% of every one of those things,\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:06.640\n is to ignore the reality that the differences\n\n32:06.640 --> 32:09.840\n in the culture and practices and norms\n\n32:09.840 --> 32:11.600\n of the various population groups\n\n32:11.600 --> 32:14.840\n will lead to differences in their representation\n\n32:14.840 --> 32:17.080\n amongst people who are outstanding performers\n\n32:17.080 --> 32:20.080\n in one or another activity.\n\n32:20.080 --> 32:24.040\n How do you know if the difference in culture\n\n32:24.040 --> 32:26.920\n accounts for the difference in outcomes,\n\n32:26.920 --> 32:30.120\n or it's the existence of barriers,\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:32.960\n especially barriers early on in life,\n\n32:32.960 --> 32:35.280\n of discrimination that are racially based?\n\n32:35.280 --> 32:38.120\n So if you think about affirmative action,\n\n32:41.040 --> 32:44.840\n in which ways is affirmative action empowering,\n\n32:44.840 --> 32:47.480\n in which way is it limiting\n\n32:47.480 --> 32:50.800\n for these early development of different groups,\n\n32:50.800 --> 32:53.080\n but let's just speak to African Americans.\n\n32:53.080 --> 32:56.280\n We should say that you went to some no name\n\n32:56.280 --> 32:57.720\n Northwestern University at first,\n\n32:57.720 --> 33:00.480\n but then you ended up with the great university of MIT.\n\n33:01.440 --> 33:05.840\n So that's your, not early, but middle development.\n\n33:06.960 --> 33:09.040\n So speaking of the development,\n\n33:09.040 --> 33:13.240\n the opportunities, the equality of opportunity,\n\n33:13.240 --> 33:15.680\n how do we know we got that equality right?\n\n33:17.000 --> 33:19.360\n Yeah, I'm glad you put it like that.\n\n33:19.360 --> 33:20.640\n We were talking about results,\n\n33:20.640 --> 33:22.120\n now we're talking about opportunity.\n\n33:22.120 --> 33:23.920\n I was taking the position that\n\n33:23.920 --> 33:28.920\n when King says, I have a dream and he envisions a world\n\n33:29.560 --> 33:32.320\n where his children will not be barred\n\n33:32.320 --> 33:34.920\n from the good things in life\n\n33:34.920 --> 33:37.040\n because of the color of their skin,\n\n33:37.040 --> 33:42.040\n we're talking about opportunity, not about results.\n\n33:42.560 --> 33:45.360\n But opportunity is not just something\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:48.680\n that depends upon what the law is\n\n33:48.680 --> 33:50.000\n and what public policies are.\n\n33:50.000 --> 33:54.760\n Opportunity also depends upon the social conditions\n\n33:54.760 --> 33:56.880\n in which people are raised,\n\n33:56.880 --> 33:58.360\n the social and economic conditions.\n\n33:58.360 --> 34:03.360\n So the child of a poor family that has no resources,\n\n34:04.680 --> 34:06.440\n it doesn't have the same opportunity\n\n34:06.440 --> 34:08.680\n as a child of a wealthy family\n\n34:08.680 --> 34:11.720\n to realize their full human potential.\n\n34:11.720 --> 34:14.240\n You asked me, how can we tell whether or not\n\n34:14.240 --> 34:19.080\n a difference in outcomes is a reflection\n\n34:19.080 --> 34:21.120\n of unequal opportunity,\n\n34:21.120 --> 34:23.520\n or it's a reflection of differences in culture\n\n34:23.520 --> 34:26.680\n and interest and practice?\n\n34:26.680 --> 34:29.600\n And I don't know that there's a single answer\n\n34:29.600 --> 34:30.440\n to that question,\n\n34:30.440 --> 34:33.440\n but I think one wants to look at the data,\n\n34:33.440 --> 34:36.600\n one wants to try to measure.\n\n34:37.840 --> 34:40.560\n As a social scientist, I would say what you wanna do\n\n34:40.560 --> 34:45.560\n is you wanna estimate the significance of various factors\n\n34:47.240 --> 34:48.480\n for determining the outcome.\n\n34:48.480 --> 34:51.840\n If the outcome is how much money does a person make\n\n34:51.840 --> 34:53.720\n when they work in the labor market?\n\n34:53.720 --> 34:56.640\n So you look at their wages and you think,\n\n34:56.640 --> 34:58.640\n well, that depends upon a number of things.\n\n34:58.640 --> 35:00.920\n It depends upon how educated they are,\n\n35:00.920 --> 35:02.920\n what kind of skills they have,\n\n35:02.920 --> 35:06.960\n what kind of work experience they have, and so on.\n\n35:06.960 --> 35:09.840\n And those things are all legitimate factors\n\n35:11.240 --> 35:13.840\n that might determine how much they end up making\n\n35:13.840 --> 35:15.680\n in the labor market.\n\n35:15.680 --> 35:19.680\n But you also wanna perhaps, controlling for those things,\n\n35:19.680 --> 35:23.280\n see whether or not the fact that they are black\n\n35:23.280 --> 35:25.720\n or they are Latino or whatever,\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:29.320\n fact that they are male or that they are female,\n\n35:29.320 --> 35:31.880\n the fact that they do or do not speak English\n\n35:31.880 --> 35:34.440\n as their native language, this kind of thing,\n\n35:34.440 --> 35:38.680\n whether those factors also are implicated\n\n35:38.680 --> 35:42.320\n in determining how successful they are in the labor market.\n\n35:42.320 --> 35:46.360\n And if you find that after you have controlled\n\n35:46.360 --> 35:51.360\n for the things that are legitimately determining success\n\n35:51.800 --> 35:52.920\n and failure in the labor market,\n\n35:52.920 --> 35:56.480\n like skills and education and experience,\n\n35:56.480 --> 35:58.640\n having controlled for those things,\n\n35:58.640 --> 36:01.640\n the fact that a person is black or is a woman\n\n36:01.640 --> 36:06.640\n or is an immigrant or is of Latino background\n\n36:09.440 --> 36:11.680\n also affects their earnings,\n\n36:11.680 --> 36:14.440\n then you might conclude that to that extent,\n\n36:14.440 --> 36:16.720\n they're not getting equal opportunity in the labor market,\n\n36:16.720 --> 36:17.800\n that kind of idea.\n\n36:18.960 --> 36:22.160\n But I wanna focus a little bit more here\n\n36:22.160 --> 36:23.760\n on what we mean by opportunity\n\n36:23.760 --> 36:28.760\n because it's not just whether employers treat the worker\n\n36:29.840 --> 36:33.160\n on a fair and even basis,\n\n36:33.160 --> 36:36.760\n irregardless of the worker's racial or ethnic background.\n\n36:36.760 --> 36:39.560\n That's one opportunity issue,\n\n36:39.560 --> 36:43.720\n but that's at the end of the development process.\n\n36:43.720 --> 36:46.800\n They are now presenting themselves to the market,\n\n36:46.800 --> 36:50.880\n trying to find work and being employed at this or that wage.\n\n36:50.880 --> 36:52.760\n That's the end of the line.\n\n36:52.760 --> 36:54.960\n What about the developmental opportunity,\n\n36:54.960 --> 36:58.760\n the opportunity to acquire skills in the first place?\n\n36:58.760 --> 37:00.200\n That goes all the way back,\n\n37:00.200 --> 37:01.560\n that goes all the way back to birth.\n\n37:01.560 --> 37:03.480\n It even goes back to before birth.\n\n37:03.480 --> 37:08.480\n Or the mother carrying the infant in the womb,\n\n37:10.520 --> 37:15.320\n she has certain nutritional practices\n\n37:15.320 --> 37:18.360\n as she might be smoking or drinking alcohol\n\n37:18.360 --> 37:19.200\n or something like that.\n\n37:19.200 --> 37:20.840\n I'm not saying she is, I'm not saying she isn't,\n\n37:20.840 --> 37:23.360\n I'm just saying whether she is or she isn't\n\n37:23.360 --> 37:27.080\n that will affect the development of the fetus.\n\n37:27.080 --> 37:32.000\n The newborn, now there's a question of environment.\n\n37:32.000 --> 37:33.680\n There's a question of the development\n\n37:33.680 --> 37:37.800\n of their neurological potential.\n\n37:37.800 --> 37:40.200\n Do they learn how to read?\n\n37:40.200 --> 37:42.360\n Are they stimulated verbally?\n\n37:42.360 --> 37:44.360\n How many words have they heard spoken?\n\n37:45.320 --> 37:49.680\n Are they being nurtured in a home environment\n\n37:49.680 --> 37:52.760\n so as to maximize the possibility\n\n37:52.760 --> 37:55.160\n of them achieving their human potential?\n\n37:55.160 --> 37:57.920\n What about the peer group influences?\n\n37:57.920 --> 38:02.400\n What about the values and norms of the surrounding\n\n38:03.600 --> 38:05.920\n human communities in which they're embedded?\n\n38:05.920 --> 38:08.560\n Do they encourage the young person\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:13.320\n to apply themselves in a systematic way\n\n38:13.320 --> 38:15.920\n to their studies and to their focus\n\n38:15.920 --> 38:18.880\n on their acquisition of language command\n\n38:18.880 --> 38:21.480\n and of their educational potential?\n\n38:22.520 --> 38:25.560\n So development is not only something\n\n38:25.560 --> 38:29.760\n that is controlled by the society's practices,\n\n38:29.760 --> 38:32.280\n it's also something that is influenced\n\n38:32.280 --> 38:37.000\n by the cultural background of the individual.\n\n38:37.000 --> 38:40.280\n And those things are not equal.\n\n38:40.280 --> 38:45.280\n Those things vary across groups in a very significant way.\n\n38:46.560 --> 38:50.280\n And that too will be a factor\n\n38:50.280 --> 38:53.480\n determining disparities of outcome.\n\n38:53.480 --> 38:56.000\n So when I see outcomes that are different,\n\n38:56.000 --> 38:58.720\n I see wealth holding that's different.\n\n38:58.720 --> 39:01.000\n I see educational achievement that's different.\n\n39:01.000 --> 39:03.720\n I see representation in the professional schools\n\n39:03.720 --> 39:05.040\n and law school and medical school\n\n39:05.040 --> 39:06.800\n that's different between groups.\n\n39:06.800 --> 39:11.000\n One question is are the institutions treating people fairly?\n\n39:11.000 --> 39:15.240\n But another question is do the background\n\n39:15.240 --> 39:17.240\n in social and cultural influences\n\n39:17.240 --> 39:20.640\n equip people in the same way?\n\n39:20.640 --> 39:22.400\n And we know that the answer to that,\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:25.840\n not in every instance do they equip people in the same way.\n\n39:25.840 --> 39:28.320\n And so it makes the judgment, the moral judgment\n\n39:28.320 --> 39:32.600\n that we make when we see inequality of outcome complicated.\n\n39:34.040 --> 39:39.040\n Inequality of outcome is a systemic factor to some degree,\n\n39:39.080 --> 39:43.880\n but it is also a cultural factor to some degree,\n\n39:43.880 --> 39:46.760\n I wanna say, and that's controversial, I know.\n\n39:47.920 --> 39:50.200\n A lot of people, they think of themselves\n\n39:50.200 --> 39:51.360\n as being progressive.\n\n39:51.360 --> 39:55.200\n They wanna point a finger at society\n\n39:55.200 --> 39:57.040\n whenever they see a disparity.\n\n39:58.320 --> 40:00.120\n But I think that that's a mistake.\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:05.120\n I think it misunderstands the difficulty of the problem.\n\n40:05.800 --> 40:08.560\n You think that if you get the right law,\n\n40:08.560 --> 40:11.040\n if you have the right public policy,\n\n40:11.040 --> 40:13.480\n if the right politicians are elected to office,\n\n40:13.480 --> 40:16.040\n suddenly those disparities will go away.\n\n40:16.040 --> 40:21.040\n And I'm here to tell you that that's a false hope.\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:26.160\n And moreover, it is probably the wrong goal.\n\n40:27.400 --> 40:28.880\n But I mean, we could go into that.\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:30.440\n You were talking about affirmative action,\n\n40:30.440 --> 40:33.520\n which is something else altogether.\n\n40:33.520 --> 40:35.800\n And you were talking about me and my education,\n\n40:35.800 --> 40:39.280\n which is also something that's a little bit different.\n\n40:39.280 --> 40:41.040\n And I'm happy to talk about those things.\n\n40:41.040 --> 40:44.520\n Northwestern University, by the way, was a great university.\n\n40:44.520 --> 40:47.080\n I'm just joking, it's one of the great universities\n\n40:47.080 --> 40:48.040\n of the world, yes.\n\n40:48.040 --> 40:51.120\n And I studied mathematics at Northwestern University,\n\n40:51.120 --> 40:54.000\n which is how I ended up at MIT in the first place.\n\n40:54.000 --> 40:58.080\n And I got a very good technical training in mathematics\n\n40:58.080 --> 41:00.000\n when I was at Northwestern, so.\n\n41:00.000 --> 41:03.560\n You love both mathematics and human nature.\n\n41:03.560 --> 41:08.320\n And so, which is why you ended up going into economics\n\n41:08.320 --> 41:11.920\n at one of the great economics programs in the world at MIT\n\n41:11.920 --> 41:13.040\n and getting your PhD there.\n\n41:13.040 --> 41:16.280\n So one of the many hats you wear is that of an economist,\n\n41:16.280 --> 41:19.880\n which allows you to think systematically and rigorously\n\n41:19.880 --> 41:23.000\n about the way the world and the way humans work at scale.\n\n41:24.840 --> 41:28.720\n Trying to remove the full mushy mess of humans,\n\n41:28.720 --> 41:32.400\n like a psychology perspective, economics allows you to do.\n\n41:33.560 --> 41:35.800\n Well, economics is one of the social sciences.\n\n41:35.800 --> 41:39.320\n I think there's value in psychology and in sociology.\n\n41:39.320 --> 41:42.000\n There's a lot to know that doesn't come up\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:44.080\n within the study of economics.\n\n41:44.080 --> 41:49.080\n We study markets and the dynamics of economic development\n\n41:49.280 --> 41:54.280\n and trade and so on.\n\n41:54.400 --> 41:59.200\n But yeah, speaking personally, as I was coming along,\n\n41:59.200 --> 42:01.160\n I was fascinated by mathematics.\n\n42:01.160 --> 42:04.600\n I was good at it and ended up at Northwestern\n\n42:04.600 --> 42:09.600\n and took a lot of courses there in functional analysis\n\n42:09.600 --> 42:14.480\n and logic and mathematics and dynamical systems\n\n42:14.480 --> 42:18.280\n and stuff that I ended up employing\n\n42:18.280 --> 42:20.920\n in my graduate studies in economics.\n\n42:20.920 --> 42:25.680\n But you're right, I was not satisfied simply\n\n42:25.680 --> 42:27.560\n to be proving theorems.\n\n42:27.560 --> 42:32.160\n I wanted to be addressing issues of social significance\n\n42:32.160 --> 42:33.720\n and economics.\n\n42:33.720 --> 42:37.960\n I discovered to my delight was a field of study\n\n42:37.960 --> 42:41.480\n that allowed me both to develop\n\n42:41.480 --> 42:45.320\n rigorous analytical frameworks,\n\n42:45.320 --> 42:50.320\n modeling and precision of logical deduction\n\n42:52.240 --> 42:56.080\n and inference on the one hand,\n\n42:56.080 --> 43:00.440\n satisfying my mathematical interests,\n\n43:00.440 --> 43:01.280\n but on the other hand,\n\n43:01.280 --> 43:03.800\n could address questions of social significance\n\n43:03.800 --> 43:07.600\n like why does racial inequality persist?\n\n43:07.600 --> 43:10.360\n Why are some countries prospering and growing\n\n43:10.360 --> 43:12.880\n and others less so?\n\n43:12.880 --> 43:16.040\n Why do the prices of raw materials fluctuate\n\n43:16.040 --> 43:19.280\n in the way that they do over time and so on and so forth?\n\n43:19.280 --> 43:24.280\n And I ended up falling in love with the application\n\n43:24.280 --> 43:29.280\n of mathematical analysis to the study of social issues.\n\n43:29.360 --> 43:32.080\n What do you use beautiful about mathematics,\n\n43:32.080 --> 43:35.600\n about mathematical puzzles, about logic,\n\n43:35.600 --> 43:36.800\n all those kinds of things?\n\n43:36.800 --> 43:39.400\n Because it's still there.\n\n43:39.400 --> 43:41.160\n The love for math is still there for you.\n\n43:41.160 --> 43:43.280\n So is there something you could speak to?\n\n43:43.280 --> 43:46.600\n What is the kernel, the flame of that love?\n\n43:48.000 --> 43:49.080\n It's like magic.\n\n43:50.120 --> 43:52.800\n I mean, you know, being able to prove something\n\n43:52.800 --> 43:56.120\n and I mean, you know, I think of offhand,\n\n43:56.120 --> 43:58.960\n you know, there's no largest prime number, okay?\n\n43:58.960 --> 44:02.520\n So how would somebody know that?\n\n44:02.520 --> 44:03.480\n Okay, what's a prime number?\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:05.920\n So a prime number is a number that has a whole number\n\n44:05.920 --> 44:08.720\n that has no divisor other than one.\n\n44:08.720 --> 44:11.040\n There are no divisors of the number\n\n44:11.040 --> 44:16.040\n that makes it a prime number, like 13 or 19 or 37,\n\n44:16.280 --> 44:17.520\n whatever, okay.\n\n44:17.520 --> 44:19.560\n So they're prime numbers.\n\n44:19.560 --> 44:20.760\n There's no largest prime number.\n\n44:20.760 --> 44:22.160\n There are infinite number of prime numbers.\n\n44:22.160 --> 44:23.920\n There's no largest prime number, okay?\n\n44:23.920 --> 44:24.760\n That's an idea.\n\n44:24.760 --> 44:26.720\n You can get your mind around it in an instant.\n\n44:26.720 --> 44:31.680\n It doesn't take a whole lot of depth to see the question.\n\n44:31.680 --> 44:33.240\n There's no largest prime number.\n\n44:33.240 --> 44:35.440\n I wonder if prime numbers show up in economics.\n\n44:35.440 --> 44:36.280\n I mean that.\n\n44:36.280 --> 44:39.120\n Oh, they don't show up in economics except cryptography.\n\n44:39.120 --> 44:40.320\n I understand that's important.\n\n44:40.320 --> 44:41.160\n Yes, yes.\n\n44:41.160 --> 44:44.480\n For code, you know, in coding stuff.\n\n44:44.480 --> 44:45.920\n And that shows up in economics.\n\n44:45.920 --> 44:49.560\n But in terms of models, probably not.\n\n44:49.560 --> 44:52.720\n That's, so prime numbers are little,\n\n44:55.080 --> 44:58.760\n you know, in abstract algebra,\n\n44:58.760 --> 45:00.880\n it's like they show up in all these places\n\n45:00.880 --> 45:04.200\n that are just like beautiful mathematical puzzles\n\n45:04.200 --> 45:05.960\n that don't immediately have an application,\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:09.040\n but somehow maybe challenge you,\n\n45:09.040 --> 45:11.440\n and as a result, push mathematics forward.\n\n45:11.440 --> 45:14.160\n Like Fermat's last theorem, you know,\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:18.200\n as far as I know, no obvious real world application,\n\n45:18.200 --> 45:19.960\n but it has challenged mathematicians\n\n45:19.960 --> 45:21.080\n throughout the centuries.\n\n45:21.080 --> 45:22.120\n Indeed.\n\n45:22.120 --> 45:27.120\n And somehow indirectly progressed the field, but.\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:31.640\n That the rational numbers are countable.\n\n45:31.640 --> 45:34.760\n They can be put in one to one relationship\n\n45:34.760 --> 45:37.000\n with the integers and, you know,\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.800\n but that the real numbers are not countable\n\n45:38.800 --> 45:41.080\n and there's a lot more real, quote unquote,\n\n45:41.080 --> 45:41.920\n more real numbers.\n\n45:41.920 --> 45:43.360\n These are orders of infinity.\n\n45:43.360 --> 45:48.360\n This is Cantor, Georg Cantor, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n45:48.880 --> 45:52.680\n Or G\u00f6del's theorem, I studied this as an undergraduate,\n\n45:52.680 --> 45:54.440\n you know, the incompleteness theorem\n\n45:54.440 --> 45:58.040\n that there are propositions within any logical system\n\n45:58.040 --> 46:02.600\n that's rich enough to accommodate arithmetic.\n\n46:02.600 --> 46:04.520\n There are going to be propositions\n\n46:04.520 --> 46:06.560\n that you can formulate that are true,\n\n46:06.560 --> 46:09.440\n but that you cannot prove to be true.\n\n46:10.600 --> 46:14.680\n So the idea that you could systematically develop\n\n46:14.680 --> 46:18.200\n a logical framework for mathematical inquiry\n\n46:19.080 --> 46:21.800\n that could demonstrate the truth or falsity\n\n46:21.800 --> 46:26.800\n of any proposition is not a feasible goal.\n\n46:26.800 --> 46:27.640\n A feasible goal.\n\n46:27.640 --> 46:30.600\n This was Hilbert's project as I understand it\n\n46:30.600 --> 46:35.280\n and G\u00f6del showed that there was no hope ever\n\n46:35.280 --> 46:39.120\n of being able to demonstrate the closure\n\n46:39.120 --> 46:41.480\n of logical systems that were rich enough\n\n46:41.480 --> 46:43.880\n to accommodate the real numbers.\n\n46:43.880 --> 46:47.960\n They gave an existential crisis to all mathematicians\n\n46:47.960 --> 46:50.760\n and scientists alike and humans\n\n46:50.760 --> 46:52.480\n because maybe you can't prove everything.\n\n46:52.480 --> 46:56.960\n I remember, you know, when I was a junior college,\n\n46:56.960 --> 46:58.160\n a community college student\n\n46:58.160 --> 47:00.080\n before I transferred to Northwestern\n\n47:00.080 --> 47:04.520\n and I took a calculus course and it was a lot of fun\n\n47:04.520 --> 47:09.440\n and it was differentiating algebraic expressions\n\n47:09.440 --> 47:12.760\n and integrating and using trigonometric substitutions\n\n47:12.760 --> 47:16.080\n and it was a lot of simple problem solving.\n\n47:16.080 --> 47:17.440\n I get to Northwestern,\n\n47:17.440 --> 47:19.920\n I take a course in differential equations.\n\n47:19.920 --> 47:23.040\n And again, it was a lot of formulaic applying\n\n47:23.040 --> 47:25.360\n if you get a differential equation of this structure\n\n47:25.360 --> 47:28.240\n like if it's linear, you got exponentials, et cetera,\n\n47:28.240 --> 47:29.800\n you can solve it.\n\n47:29.800 --> 47:32.840\n And then I took a course that showed me, you know,\n\n47:32.840 --> 47:35.600\n where the question was not how to solve\n\n47:35.600 --> 47:38.560\n any particular functional expression,\n\n47:38.560 --> 47:41.760\n but it was proving the existence of a solution\n\n47:41.760 --> 47:45.720\n to a differential equation where it was like X dot equals\n\n47:45.720 --> 47:49.240\n F of X and T and F is just some arbitrary function.\n\n47:49.240 --> 47:52.400\n What do I have to assume about the function F\n\n47:52.400 --> 47:54.680\n in order to know that there exists a solution\n\n47:54.680 --> 47:56.960\n to the differential equation,\n\n47:56.960 --> 48:00.800\n dx dt equals F of X and T.\n\n48:00.800 --> 48:03.880\n And it's basically, they called it a Lipschitz condition.\n\n48:03.880 --> 48:08.200\n It's a condition about the bounding of the slope\n\n48:08.200 --> 48:12.320\n of the function F as a function of X that it doesn't,\n\n48:13.600 --> 48:16.480\n that you can sort of uniformly bound the slope\n\n48:16.480 --> 48:20.240\n on that function and then you can use a iterative process\n\n48:20.240 --> 48:24.760\n to show that the sequence of, you know, partial solutions\n\n48:24.760 --> 48:26.640\n to the thing converges to something that's a solution\n\n48:26.640 --> 48:27.480\n to the real thing.\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:29.480\n Anyway, again, I'm not gonna bore you\n\n48:29.480 --> 48:32.960\n or pretend that I'm a mathematician, I'm not.\n\n48:32.960 --> 48:34.080\n But what I'm saying is the difference\n\n48:34.080 --> 48:38.520\n between a specific algebraic formula\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:42.480\n that you can manipulate and solve on the one hand\n\n48:42.480 --> 48:45.320\n and the abstract question of whether there exists\n\n48:45.320 --> 48:49.680\n a solution in the general case is like a huge,\n\n48:49.680 --> 48:53.360\n was like a huge step for me in my study of mathematics\n\n48:53.360 --> 48:56.400\n and the techniques that you have to employ\n\n48:56.400 --> 48:59.680\n to address these larger questions and so on.\n\n48:59.680 --> 49:03.520\n So I, you know, when I was an undergraduate,\n\n49:03.520 --> 49:08.440\n I took the first year PhD sequence in math analysis\n\n49:08.440 --> 49:11.880\n at Northwestern from a brilliant mathematician\n\n49:11.880 --> 49:16.840\n named Avner Friedman and learned about measure theory\n\n49:16.840 --> 49:21.840\n and learned about some early functional analysis ideas\n\n49:25.160 --> 49:28.360\n and when I saw that those ideas were being applied\n\n49:28.360 --> 49:32.080\n by advanced study in economics, I was delighted.\n\n49:32.080 --> 49:34.320\n I found an intellectual home.\n\n49:34.320 --> 49:38.800\n So one of the fascinating challenges in mathematics\n\n49:38.800 --> 49:43.160\n is to think how can you, which echoes\n\n49:43.160 --> 49:47.200\n the challenge of economics, what are the properties\n\n49:47.200 --> 49:52.120\n of an equation that allow you to say something profound\n\n49:52.120 --> 49:53.720\n and say it simply?\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:56.400\n And so the question of economics is how do you\n\n49:56.400 --> 50:00.200\n construct a model where you can generalize nicely\n\n50:00.200 --> 50:03.480\n and say something profound and say it simply?\n\n50:03.480 --> 50:06.360\n So one of the questions, one of the challenges\n\n50:06.360 --> 50:11.360\n of economics is macro versus microeconomics is,\n\n50:13.520 --> 50:16.280\n you know, the world is made up of individuals.\n\n50:16.280 --> 50:18.640\n So there's a connection to this, our discussion\n\n50:18.640 --> 50:21.960\n of race and discrimination and outcomes\n\n50:21.960 --> 50:24.240\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n50:24.240 --> 50:26.560\n The world is made up of individuals,\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:29.800\n but in order to say something general,\n\n50:29.800 --> 50:34.800\n we have to construct groups in order to analyze the data.\n\n50:34.800 --> 50:37.920\n We have to aggregate that data somehow.\n\n50:37.920 --> 50:41.480\n We have to make an average over some set of people.\n\n50:41.480 --> 50:46.080\n So what are the pros and cons of looking at things\n\n50:46.080 --> 50:50.120\n like equality of opportunity and equality of outcome\n\n50:50.120 --> 50:53.600\n based on groups versus based on individuals\n\n50:53.600 --> 50:58.600\n and what are the groups, if there's any pros\n\n50:58.800 --> 51:01.560\n to looking at groups that we should be looking at?\n\n51:01.560 --> 51:04.360\n Okay, well, those are big questions.\n\n51:04.360 --> 51:06.920\n I mean, in economics, you're right.\n\n51:06.920 --> 51:10.440\n I mean, micro, you have an account of how individuals\n\n51:10.440 --> 51:13.200\n make decisions about spending their money\n\n51:13.200 --> 51:16.080\n on this consumption side and about how enterprises\n\n51:16.080 --> 51:20.600\n make decisions about what to produce, how much of it,\n\n51:20.600 --> 51:23.200\n what inputs to use, what techniques of production\n\n51:23.200 --> 51:27.960\n and so on, individual firms, individual consumers,\n\n51:27.960 --> 51:29.160\n and then you want to aggregate.\n\n51:29.160 --> 51:32.120\n So there's a so called theory of general equilibrium\n\n51:32.120 --> 51:37.120\n where you think supply and demand in a bunch of markets,\n\n51:38.200 --> 51:40.960\n you think prices that move to equilibrate,\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:43.040\n but you recognize that the price in one market\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:44.880\n affects people's behavior in another,\n\n51:44.880 --> 51:47.040\n the markets are interacting with each other.\n\n51:47.040 --> 51:49.160\n You realize that the behavior of one individual\n\n51:49.160 --> 51:53.880\n affects the supplies and available resources\n\n51:53.880 --> 51:56.840\n and for other individuals, so they're knitted together\n\n51:56.840 --> 52:00.000\n in some kind of systematic way.\n\n52:00.000 --> 52:04.640\n And you want to try to demonstrate the fact\n\n52:04.640 --> 52:07.480\n that notwithstanding all these interdependencies,\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:12.160\n there exists a solution to the system of equations\n\n52:12.160 --> 52:14.000\n that equates demand and supply\n\n52:14.000 --> 52:15.360\n across all the different markets.\n\n52:15.360 --> 52:19.120\n This is the existence of general equilibrium.\n\n52:19.120 --> 52:22.440\n Then you want to try to say something about the properties\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:25.520\n of an equilibrium, if it exists, is it efficient?\n\n52:25.520 --> 52:27.600\n What do you mean by efficiency?\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:32.000\n Well, the idea of so called Pareto efficient outcomes,\n\n52:32.000 --> 52:35.320\n these are outcomes that cannot be uniformly improved upon,\n\n52:35.320 --> 52:36.880\n everybody can't be made better off\n\n52:36.880 --> 52:39.160\n by an alternative outcome.\n\n52:39.160 --> 52:41.240\n You want to demonstrate the efficiency\n\n52:41.240 --> 52:43.880\n of competitive equilibrium.\n\n52:43.880 --> 52:45.240\n What do you mean by competition?\n\n52:45.240 --> 52:46.920\n You mean that people take their actions\n\n52:46.920 --> 52:51.760\n to do the best for themselves that they can.\n\n52:51.760 --> 52:54.400\n Profits of firms, well being of consumers,\n\n52:54.400 --> 52:57.640\n they try to do the best for themselves that they can,\n\n52:59.080 --> 53:02.000\n but they do so in reference to a set of prices\n\n53:02.000 --> 53:03.600\n that they believe they cannot control.\n\n53:03.600 --> 53:08.320\n That's the criterion of competitive market circumstance.\n\n53:08.320 --> 53:11.280\n So does a competitive equilibrium exist?\n\n53:11.280 --> 53:12.760\n Do there exist a set of prices\n\n53:12.760 --> 53:15.840\n which if everybody recognizes them as given\n\n53:15.840 --> 53:20.800\n and responds to those prices on behalf of their own interest,\n\n53:20.800 --> 53:24.360\n the outcome will be supply equaling demand\n\n53:24.360 --> 53:26.360\n in all the markets where people are interacting\n\n53:26.360 --> 53:30.080\n with one another, and that requires the use\n\n53:30.080 --> 53:33.760\n of some concepts and topology, fixed point theorems\n\n53:33.760 --> 53:36.040\n and whatnot that are familiar to mathematics,\n\n53:36.040 --> 53:38.280\n not very deep mathematical results,\n\n53:38.280 --> 53:40.520\n but important to economics.\n\n53:40.520 --> 53:43.160\n That's all about general equilibrium and whatnot.\n\n53:43.160 --> 53:45.080\n But you ask about groups.\n\n53:45.080 --> 53:49.240\n By the way, amazing whirlwind summary of all of economics,\n\n53:49.240 --> 53:51.720\n but yes, go ahead, that was great.\n\n53:53.600 --> 53:58.160\n Markets of competition of operator efficiency anyway,\n\n53:58.160 --> 53:59.040\n but yes, groups.\n\n53:59.040 --> 54:00.680\n And prices. And prices.\n\n54:01.840 --> 54:05.120\n And by the way, there are some very beautiful\n\n54:07.480 --> 54:10.280\n formalizations of everything that I'm saying here.\n\n54:10.280 --> 54:11.720\n You end up in vector spaces,\n\n54:11.720 --> 54:15.800\n you end up with sets of bundles of consumption\n\n54:15.800 --> 54:17.840\n and production, you end up with convexity,\n\n54:17.840 --> 54:19.840\n you end up with hyperplanes,\n\n54:19.840 --> 54:23.800\n which are in this finite dimensional vector space,\n\n54:23.800 --> 54:28.800\n which are all of the bundles that have the same value\n\n54:29.840 --> 54:30.680\n at a certain price.\n\n54:30.680 --> 54:32.160\n You end up with inner products.\n\n54:35.120 --> 54:36.280\n It's very pretty.\n\n54:36.280 --> 54:38.760\n Yeah, but you almost forget that it's just a bunch\n\n54:38.760 --> 54:41.320\n of humans transacting with each other.\n\n54:43.720 --> 54:47.080\n That markets are made up of individuals.\n\n54:47.080 --> 54:49.000\n Markets are made up of individuals.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:51.480\n And in order to carry out this formalization,\n\n54:51.480 --> 54:54.560\n you have to make assumptions about the individuals.\n\n54:54.560 --> 54:58.960\n And the end result is true in a formal sense,\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:03.120\n but may not be true as a representation of the reality,\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:04.600\n because it depends upon assumptions\n\n55:04.600 --> 55:06.640\n that themselves may not hold.\n\n55:07.920 --> 55:10.960\n But at least you know what it is that has to be true\n\n55:10.960 --> 55:15.880\n in order for your formal framework to be relevant,\n\n55:15.880 --> 55:18.840\n which is already a step in the right direction, I think.\n\n55:18.840 --> 55:22.520\n I mean, the formalization is better than the intuition.\n\n55:22.520 --> 55:24.720\n There aren't your intuition where we sit back\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:28.440\n and we don't really know exactly what we're talking about\n\n55:28.440 --> 55:33.000\n because we haven't pinned it down in a precise way.\n\n55:33.000 --> 55:34.960\n I'm in favor of the formalization.\n\n55:34.960 --> 55:37.720\n People, they think, what is mathematics\n\n55:37.720 --> 55:39.160\n and the social sciences?\n\n55:39.160 --> 55:40.480\n After all, we're dealing with people.\n\n55:40.480 --> 55:42.160\n People are not automata.\n\n55:42.160 --> 55:43.600\n I agree with that.\n\n55:43.600 --> 55:48.240\n But the analysis of the interaction of people,\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:53.240\n I think, to be rigorous, requires us to be specific\n\n55:53.240 --> 55:55.120\n about what we're talking about, about markets,\n\n55:55.120 --> 55:57.920\n about consumers, about firms, about profits,\n\n55:57.920 --> 56:00.800\n about technology, about preferences.\n\n56:00.800 --> 56:04.520\n And that's the language of economics.\n\n56:06.360 --> 56:11.360\n But people's behavior depends upon what they seek in life,\n\n56:11.360 --> 56:14.880\n depends upon their goals and their objectives.\n\n56:14.880 --> 56:17.320\n Those things are at play.\n\n56:17.320 --> 56:20.200\n They can be pushed this way or that.\n\n56:20.200 --> 56:23.640\n So, I mean, nationalism,\n\n56:23.640 --> 56:25.640\n fighting and dying for your country,\n\n56:27.240 --> 56:31.520\n religion, sacrificing on behalf of some abstract ideal\n\n56:31.520 --> 56:35.440\n of the good or of what is the human situation\n\n56:35.440 --> 56:37.840\n and what is the meaning of life.\n\n56:37.840 --> 56:40.280\n Economists have to assume that these things\n\n56:40.280 --> 56:41.760\n are some particular thing\n\n56:41.760 --> 56:44.880\n before they can turn the crank on their machine\n\n56:44.880 --> 56:48.520\n to analyze the outcomes of human interaction.\n\n56:48.520 --> 56:53.520\n And yet these things, belief in my identity,\n\n56:53.920 --> 56:56.400\n but the things that I'm willing to sacrifice and die\n\n56:56.400 --> 56:59.320\n for purposes of life that I affirm\n\n56:59.320 --> 57:03.920\n and pass on to my children are important preconditions\n\n57:03.920 --> 57:06.840\n for actually carrying out any economic analysis.\n\n57:06.840 --> 57:11.000\n And they are subject to manipulation and to change over time.\n\n57:11.000 --> 57:13.360\n And that's not something that economics\n\n57:13.360 --> 57:15.280\n has a whole lot to say about.\n\n57:15.280 --> 57:17.760\n Well, is there some general things\n\n57:17.760 --> 57:19.800\n that are really powerful in terms of,\n\n57:19.800 --> 57:24.240\n you said nation, religion, those are groups.\n\n57:24.240 --> 57:26.640\n Can you group people nicely\n\n57:26.640 --> 57:29.200\n in helping you understand human nature?\n\n57:29.200 --> 57:33.880\n So group them into nations based on their citizenry.\n\n57:33.880 --> 57:35.280\n That's geography, right?\n\n57:35.280 --> 57:39.320\n The geographic location of your birth\n\n57:39.320 --> 57:44.320\n or your long term residence, or maybe religious belief,\n\n57:44.520 --> 57:48.480\n what religion you believe over time.\n\n57:48.480 --> 57:49.680\n Is there groups like that?\n\n57:49.680 --> 57:54.680\n And then race, is that useful?\n\n57:56.000 --> 57:59.520\n What are the pros and cons of looking at outcomes\n\n57:59.520 --> 58:04.520\n based on these kinds of groups, race in particular?\n\n58:07.200 --> 58:09.040\n I think they're pros and I think they're cons.\n\n58:09.040 --> 58:13.360\n I mean, I am myself, Glenn Loury sits before you right now,\n\n58:14.440 --> 58:16.680\n a black American, an African American.\n\n58:16.680 --> 58:19.160\n I quote unquote, I identify as,\n\n58:19.160 --> 58:21.240\n that's the way they talk about it nowadays.\n\n58:21.240 --> 58:22.840\n I identify as a black American.\n\n58:22.840 --> 58:27.840\n My skin is brown, my hair is coarse, my nose is broad,\n\n58:27.840 --> 58:31.000\n relative to the way other people's noses look.\n\n58:31.000 --> 58:32.680\n My lips are thicker.\n\n58:32.680 --> 58:37.680\n That's a consequence of my ancestral descent\n\n58:37.760 --> 58:42.760\n from the human population resident in the African continent\n\n58:43.080 --> 58:47.740\n in millennia past, my race.\n\n58:49.560 --> 58:50.760\n Here in the United States,\n\n58:50.760 --> 58:55.760\n we have various quote unquote races defined crudely\n\n58:55.760 --> 58:58.880\n in the way that I just tried to define myself.\n\n58:59.840 --> 59:03.480\n You could say, and I think there is a very powerful argument\n\n59:03.480 --> 59:07.480\n that these are superficial differences.\n\n59:07.480 --> 59:09.200\n I mean, really?\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:11.960\n Why should it matter that your eye color\n\n59:11.960 --> 59:16.960\n or your hair color or the shape of the bones in your face\n\n59:17.120 --> 59:19.220\n or the color, the tone of your skin,\n\n59:19.220 --> 59:20.200\n the amount of melanin,\n\n59:20.200 --> 59:23.120\n how it is that you react to ultraviolet radiation\n\n59:23.120 --> 59:28.120\n in terms of your skin, what is that the basis of anything?\n\n59:30.720 --> 59:33.320\n I mean, that's arbitrary, that's not meaningful.\n\n59:33.320 --> 59:34.680\n Could there really be meaning\n\n59:34.680 --> 59:38.000\n in these superficial differences among human beings?\n\n59:38.000 --> 59:40.960\n Isn't that a archaic or barbaric way\n\n59:40.960 --> 59:42.160\n of thinking about ourselves,\n\n59:42.160 --> 59:46.000\n to look at each other's skin color or hair texture\n\n59:46.000 --> 59:49.480\n and then to decide, oh, that's a black or that's a white\n\n59:49.480 --> 59:53.040\n or that's a Latin or that's an Asian or that's a whatever.\n\n59:53.040 --> 59:58.040\n That's something that we should outgrow, a person might say.\n\n59:59.360 --> 1:00:03.360\n That's a relic of a kind of tribal society\n\n1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:06.900\n of a kind of pre modern society\n\n1:00:06.900 --> 1:00:11.360\n where we built real structure\n\n1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:14.880\n on the basis of such superficial difference.\n\n1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.080\n A person could say that.\n\n1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:20.640\n On the other hand, I am a black American.\n\n1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:22.960\n I mean, that's part of my identity,\n\n1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:25.580\n that's part of my heritage,\n\n1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:29.460\n it's part of the stories that I tell myself\n\n1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:33.000\n about who my people are.\n\n1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.320\n Why do I need a people?\n\n1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:37.400\n Why do I need a narrative of descent\n\n1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:42.400\n in which I affiliate with a racially defined people?\n\n1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:45.760\n Do I really need that?\n\n1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:48.120\n I mean, I think that's an important question.\n\n1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:52.440\n In fact, this is a confession, think of myself as black.\n\n1:00:52.440 --> 1:00:55.080\n I could think of myself as simply human.\n\n1:00:55.080 --> 1:00:59.000\n I could not identify specifically as black.\n\n1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:03.200\n I could say, my eyes are brown too, so what?\n\n1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:04.480\n I'm a brown eye?\n\n1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:08.280\n I mean, I'm gonna invent a group based on my eye color.\n\n1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.400\n I weigh 290 pounds.\n\n1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:12.520\n I'm gonna have a body size group.\n\n1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:17.440\n I'm a plus 200 and that's quote, who I am, close quote.\n\n1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:18.840\n I don't do that.\n\n1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.040\n I came from Chicago.\n\n1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:23.760\n Yes, I do have a certain sense of affinity with my hometown.\n\n1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:26.320\n I'm a Chicago born person,\n\n1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:29.800\n but frankly, I haven't lived in Chicago since 1979.\n\n1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.160\n That's a long time.\n\n1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:37.640\n I wear my Chicago origins very, very lightly.\n\n1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:40.160\n I would not go to war with someone from Cleveland\n\n1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.000\n or St. Louis and fight to the death\n\n1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.860\n with that St. Louis person or that Cleveland person\n\n1:01:46.860 --> 1:01:49.720\n based upon the fact that we come from different cities.\n\n1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.120\n And you have even abandoned in your heart\n\n1:01:52.120 --> 1:01:53.600\n the Chicago Bulls.\n\n1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:56.000\n There's some Chicago that's still in me, I suppose,\n\n1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:57.600\n but it's not very deep.\n\n1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:00.400\n It's not quote, who I am anymore.\n\n1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:02.880\n And I'm wondering, here I'm trying to pose the question,\n\n1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:06.080\n why is it that being a descendant of African slaves\n\n1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:06.920\n should be who I am?\n\n1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:08.100\n So there's some answers.\n\n1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:12.880\n One answer is people will look at me\n\n1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:17.000\n and deal with me differently based upon what they see.\n\n1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.120\n I don't have control over that.\n\n1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:22.400\n I'm going to be perceived as a member of a group,\n\n1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:24.960\n whether or not I elect to affiliate myself\n\n1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:27.840\n with that group or not.\n\n1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.620\n Therefore, I need to be mindful of the fact\n\n1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:36.620\n that regardless of what my internal orientation is,\n\n1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:40.400\n the world will perceive me in a particular way\n\n1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:42.480\n and will perceive me differently\n\n1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:44.120\n based upon the color of my skin.\n\n1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:46.960\n So a police officer who stops me at two o clock\n\n1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:49.600\n in the morning because my tail light is out\n\n1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:54.120\n and ask me for my automobile registration\n\n1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.040\n and I reach quickly to the glove compartment\n\n1:02:57.040 --> 1:02:59.120\n to get my registration.\n\n1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.760\n And the police officer says, show me your hands.\n\n1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.880\n And I don't quite hear what he says\n\n1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:07.640\n or I ignore what he says as I'm getting my document\n\n1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:08.760\n out of my glove compartment.\n\n1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:11.880\n But the police officer thinks because I have not responded\n\n1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.440\n to his demand to show my hands\n\n1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:15.600\n that I might be reaching for a weapon.\n\n1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:18.400\n And the police officer sees that I'm black\n\n1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:22.040\n and fears that the likelihood that I might have a weapon\n\n1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:25.020\n is higher because in that town at that time,\n\n1:03:25.020 --> 1:03:28.320\n a lot of the people who get stopped with weapons in their car\n\n1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:31.700\n happen to be black and male and so on.\n\n1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:34.960\n And he pulls his weapon and he discharges it\n\n1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:37.560\n and I'm bleeding out there and I'm dead now.\n\n1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:40.200\n And all of that is a possibility that's very real\n\n1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:42.440\n and it's based upon the color of my skin.\n\n1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.960\n And therefore, when he stops me,\n\n1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.920\n I keep my hands on the steering wheel\n\n1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:49.000\n and I don't go to the glove compartment.\n\n1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.640\n And I'm fearful of the fact that he might mistake me\n\n1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:54.800\n for a criminal, et cetera.\n\n1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:58.200\n Or I walk into a high end store, clothing store.\n\n1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:00.520\n I see you're nicely dressed there, Lex.\n\n1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:02.100\n I'm not, but that's okay.\n\n1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.920\n I do have some good clothes at home.\n\n1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:07.060\n I just didn't wear them here today.\n\n1:04:07.060 --> 1:04:07.900\n But you know what I mean.\n\n1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:11.560\n And the salesman in the clothing store\n\n1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:15.920\n either treats me like an old friend\n\n1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:17.880\n and is warm and welcoming.\n\n1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:19.480\n And what can I do for you, sir?\n\n1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:20.960\n And let me show you this and that.\n\n1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:22.320\n And what are you looking for?\n\n1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:24.640\n Because he thinks I'm gonna spend $1,000 there that day\n\n1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:27.480\n and he's gonna get a 5% commission or whatever it is.\n\n1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:31.200\n And he either does that or he ignores me\n\n1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:32.520\n and looks at me with suspicion\n\n1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:34.480\n and thinks I might be trying to shoplift something\n\n1:04:34.480 --> 1:04:38.360\n or thinks I'm only gonna spend $50 and not $500\n\n1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.440\n and therefore I'm not worth his time.\n\n1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:42.240\n And I'm aware of the fact\n\n1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:44.680\n that when I go into the clothing store,\n\n1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.960\n especially the high end places where I can buy a good suit\n\n1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.760\n or buy some really good dress shirts or slacks\n\n1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:54.200\n that fit me well and so on,\n\n1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:57.460\n I'm aware of the fact that I may not be taken seriously\n\n1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:00.200\n by the salesman based upon the fact\n\n1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:03.120\n that he's looking at me and he sees a black person.\n\n1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:06.080\n And therefore I dress up\n\n1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:09.200\n before I go out to buy clothes to get,\n\n1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:10.520\n cause I wanna present myself\n\n1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:13.200\n as not someone who just walked in off the street,\n\n1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:14.580\n but as one of those black people\n\n1:05:14.580 --> 1:05:17.380\n who is really prepared to spend some money in the store\n\n1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:18.880\n so that I can be treated with respect.\n\n1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:23.780\n And I have to carry the burden such as it is\n\n1:05:23.780 --> 1:05:28.780\n of knowing that I need to earn the being taken seriously\n\n1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:33.000\n being taken seriously by overcoming the suppositions\n\n1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.720\n that people may have about me\n\n1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.400\n based upon the color of my skin, something like that.\n\n1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:43.800\n Or I ask myself, what am I gonna teach my children\n\n1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:46.440\n about who they are and where they come from?\n\n1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:50.520\n What stories am I gonna tell them about their ancestors?\n\n1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.360\n Who are their ancestors?\n\n1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:55.900\n Every African American has European ancestors.\n\n1:05:55.900 --> 1:05:59.520\n Every black person in the United States of America,\n\n1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:02.660\n I think that I can say that almost without exception.\n\n1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:05.920\n We could go to 23andMe and look at the DNA.\n\n1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:08.920\n They have European ancestors, they're not purely African.\n\n1:06:10.080 --> 1:06:12.280\n That's a fact and that's a consequence\n\n1:06:12.280 --> 1:06:16.160\n of the experience of African descended people\n\n1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:18.800\n because it's a mixed population.\n\n1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:21.880\n My name is Lowry, spelled L O U R Y\n\n1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:25.320\n but pronounced as if it were L O W E R Y.\n\n1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:29.000\n And I gather if you trace the history of that name\n\n1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.660\n that it's Scottish.\n\n1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:33.400\n So somewhere back then.\n\n1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.880\n So you could identify as a Scot.\n\n1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:40.400\n Well, or I could claim some Scottish descent, but I don't.\n\n1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:42.160\n I don't know who those ancestors are.\n\n1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:47.080\n And frankly, I don't know who my enslaved ancestors are.\n\n1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:51.080\n I can't trace my family history back very far\n\n1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:53.160\n into the 19th century.\n\n1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:57.960\n So what stories do I tell my children about who we are,\n\n1:06:57.960 --> 1:06:59.360\n about who their ancestors are?\n\n1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:01.920\n I mean, I wanna tell my children some story\n\n1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:05.320\n and that story is gonna be colored, quote unquote,\n\n1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.120\n by my race.\n\n1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:10.560\n So even though it is superficial\n\n1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:14.280\n and in an ideal world, you might think,\n\n1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:17.980\n why would human beings, I mean, I read science fiction.\n\n1:07:17.980 --> 1:07:21.480\n So there's this Chinese writer, Chixin Liu is his name.\n\n1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:26.320\n I might not pronounce it exactly right, C I X I N L I U.\n\n1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:30.320\n Chixin Liu, he has a trilogy of The Three Body Problem,\n\n1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:35.840\n The Dark Forest, and Death's End.\n\n1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:38.800\n Those are the three books of Chixin Liu's trilogy\n\n1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:42.920\n about how Trisolaris, which is another star system\n\n1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:46.560\n within a few light years of the solar system,\n\n1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:49.500\n and Earth get into a conflict.\n\n1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:54.500\n And when the Trisolaris come down to dominate Earth,\n\n1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:59.420\n suddenly all of these differences between the Chinese\n\n1:07:59.420 --> 1:08:02.440\n and the North Americans and the Europeans\n\n1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:04.720\n and the Africans and the South Asians\n\n1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:08.160\n become kind of insignificant because after all,\n\n1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.320\n the Trisolaris with their advanced civilization\n\n1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:14.120\n whose star system is dying,\n\n1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:15.940\n have their eyes on the solar system,\n\n1:08:15.940 --> 1:08:18.040\n which has a planet, the third rock from the sun\n\n1:08:18.040 --> 1:08:21.560\n that is pretty habitable and the difference between us\n\n1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.540\n become pretty insignificant.\n\n1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:29.140\n So we shouldn't need for an invasion\n\n1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:34.140\n by extraterrestrial beings to have to happen\n\n1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:38.160\n before we would recognize the common humanity\n\n1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:43.120\n that we all share that is profound and is deep.\n\n1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:47.360\n We all descend in effect from the same ancestral population\n\n1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:52.200\n of Homo sapiens who walked out of East Africa eons ago\n\n1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:56.880\n and have survived amongst all of the different possible\n\n1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.960\n variations of species and whatnot,\n\n1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:02.680\n of humanoid population, the Homo sapiens have flourished,\n\n1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:05.720\n the others have died out and here we are\n\n1:09:05.720 --> 1:09:09.160\n and we can just look at the genetic endowments\n\n1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:12.580\n that characterize our biological essence\n\n1:09:12.580 --> 1:09:15.600\n and we can see that we are quote unquote\n\n1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:16.800\n the same beneath the skin\n\n1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:21.680\n and yet we end up freighting so much weight\n\n1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:23.560\n onto these superficial differences.\n\n1:09:23.560 --> 1:09:27.660\n So I can see both sides of the issue is what I'm saying.\n\n1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:30.120\n I can see the argument race is an irrelevancy\n\n1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:35.560\n because at the end of the day, deep down it is.\n\n1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:37.440\n But I can also see the argument\n\n1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:41.580\n that I hold on to racial identity because A,\n\n1:09:41.580 --> 1:09:46.460\n my racial presentation colors how other people deal with me\n\n1:09:46.460 --> 1:09:50.060\n but B, because everybody needs a story.\n\n1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:52.600\n Everybody needs an account.\n\n1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:53.640\n You tell me you're Jewish.\n\n1:09:53.640 --> 1:09:55.440\n I mean, I don't know how deep that is.\n\n1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:57.800\n I don't know how genetically profound that is.\n\n1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.800\n I do know that it's a culturally profound identity\n\n1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.160\n for a lot of people based upon maybe some of the same\n\n1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:09.700\n kind of forces that I'm talking about.\n\n1:10:09.700 --> 1:10:11.900\n A, they won't let you not be Jewish.\n\n1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:14.320\n You could say you're not Jewish\n\n1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.840\n but when Hitler is rounding people up,\n\n1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:18.680\n what you say doesn't have a whole lot to do\n\n1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:22.120\n with what the Gestapo was about.\n\n1:10:22.120 --> 1:10:24.420\n And B, you need to tell your children a story.\n\n1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:28.360\n That's the fascinating thing about this tribalism\n\n1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:33.360\n that you spoke about that we form tribes as humans\n\n1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:37.520\n throughout human history, form tribes\n\n1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:41.480\n and have directed hate toward other tribes\n\n1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:43.960\n and sometimes violence and destruction.\n\n1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:47.920\n And yet tribalism allows you to tell a story\n\n1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:51.400\n to your children, allows you to grow a culture.\n\n1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:53.080\n There's something about defining yourself\n\n1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.680\n within a particular tribe that allows you\n\n1:10:55.680 --> 1:10:57.840\n to have a tradition.\n\n1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:02.240\n You have an article that you wrote\n\n1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:05.440\n called The Case for Black Patriotism.\n\n1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:06.280\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:10.780\n So I should also say it's so interesting\n\n1:11:10.780 --> 1:11:15.780\n because for me personally, I feel, identify as,\n\n1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:21.000\n believe I am an American.\n\n1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.160\n And yet within the American umbrella,\n\n1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:27.120\n it feels that there's a longing for other tribes.\n\n1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:31.560\n You mentioned Jewish but what I honestly feel is,\n\n1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:34.440\n I mean a lot of it is humor and culture and so on\n\n1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:38.960\n is Russian and Ukrainian because that's where I come from.\n\n1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:40.600\n That's where my family is from.\n\n1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:43.280\n You know, there's like stereotypical things\n\n1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.280\n that are funny, humorous type of thing about Russians\n\n1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:52.860\n that's showing no emotion, good at chess and math,\n\n1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:57.040\n into wrestling, drinking vodka.\n\n1:11:57.040 --> 1:11:59.640\n I mean, there's literally every single stereotype.\n\n1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:01.400\n I'm in the embodiment of that.\n\n1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.200\n So there's a, you celebrate that in certain kinds of ways.\n\n1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:07.240\n There's a tradition there within the American umbrella\n\n1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:12.240\n and some of it is humor, some of it is little quirks\n\n1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:15.120\n of culture but now with the war in Russia and Ukraine,\n\n1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:18.560\n interestingly enough, even that little thing,\n\n1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:22.960\n it becomes also a source of negative tribalism.\n\n1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:27.960\n But anyway, that context aside, what is black patriotism\n\n1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:31.760\n and why do you feel?\n\n1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:35.120\n I mean, I'm speaking in an article called\n\n1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:39.840\n The Case for Black Patriotism in a Particular Context\n\n1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:45.440\n and what I'm saying basically is very simple.\n\n1:12:45.440 --> 1:12:47.600\n I'm saying we are African Americans\n\n1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.400\n and the emphasis should be on the American.\n\n1:12:54.080 --> 1:12:56.280\n I actually don't even much care\n\n1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:00.560\n for the framing African American\n\n1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:02.900\n but I'm not gonna fight with people about it.\n\n1:13:02.900 --> 1:13:05.880\n It's, I don't think it's worth fighting about.\n\n1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:08.440\n That's not how, I would just say we're Americans\n\n1:13:08.440 --> 1:13:11.080\n or if you want, we're black Americans.\n\n1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:12.660\n We're certainly not African.\n\n1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:16.400\n That is the African American population\n\n1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.700\n is a population of people who come into existence\n\n1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:24.780\n here in North America through the cauldron of slavery.\n\n1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:28.880\n There are also immigrants, immigrants from East Africa,\n\n1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:33.040\n immigrants from West Africa, immigrants from Southern Africa,\n\n1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:35.760\n immigrants from the Caribbean who descend\n\n1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:39.180\n from an ancestral population which is African.\n\n1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:43.760\n The history of the world since 1500 is a history\n\n1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:48.040\n in which people of African descent are scattered\n\n1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:53.040\n because of slavery throughout the Western hemisphere.\n\n1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:55.400\n And so here we are.\n\n1:13:55.400 --> 1:14:00.400\n But the institution of slavery ended in 1863\n\n1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:04.300\n in the United States.\n\n1:14:06.460 --> 1:14:08.720\n The struggle that we started out talking about\n\n1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.420\n which gave rise to Martin Luther King giving that speech\n\n1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:16.880\n that you say is the greatest speech in American history\n\n1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:19.520\n and I'm not gonna argue with you about that,\n\n1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:21.520\n happened right here in the United States.\n\n1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:24.440\n We are, what is the United States?\n\n1:14:24.440 --> 1:14:26.440\n The United States is a nation of immigrants.\n\n1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:30.080\n The population of the North American continent\n\n1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:32.840\n was sparsely populated by an indigenous population\n\n1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:37.840\n which was destroyed in conquest by a European population\n\n1:14:40.120 --> 1:14:45.120\n that settled here in North America and appropriated the land\n\n1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.560\n and have built a civilization here\n\n1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:51.440\n which has been peopled by a large influx of immigrants\n\n1:14:51.440 --> 1:14:56.440\n of individuals from Europe, Irish and Italian\n\n1:14:56.520 --> 1:15:01.520\n and Greek and Slavic and Jewish, Russian Jews\n\n1:15:02.040 --> 1:15:04.240\n coming in large numbers and so on\n\n1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:07.560\n and wave after wave after wave of immigration,\n\n1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:11.000\n Asian, Latin American population of people\n\n1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.840\n who have come to reside here in the United States\n\n1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:17.400\n and we black Americans who descend from slaves.\n\n1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:20.040\n We African Americans who descend from slaves.\n\n1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:21.560\n So here we are.\n\n1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:23.460\n This is a great nation.\n\n1:15:23.460 --> 1:15:28.460\n I mean, this is a monumentally significant political force\n\n1:15:30.360 --> 1:15:35.360\n which is the United States of America founded in 1776, 1787\n\n1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:41.020\n fought a war of independence from the British,\n\n1:15:41.020 --> 1:15:45.020\n established a republic which is a confederation\n\n1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.360\n of these independent colonies\n\n1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.680\n which has grown into now the 50 states\n\n1:15:50.680 --> 1:15:54.040\n of the United States of America, continental nation.\n\n1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:58.720\n The richest and most powerful nation on the planet\n\n1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:02.520\n with massive influence throughout the world\n\n1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:03.700\n for good and for ill.\n\n1:16:04.880 --> 1:16:08.840\n That's who we are, I wanna say to black people.\n\n1:16:08.840 --> 1:16:11.680\n There is no other home for us.\n\n1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.440\n This fantasy of we being a people apart\n\n1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:20.080\n back in the day when I was coming along in the 1960s,\n\n1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:20.920\n there was something called\n\n1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:23.800\n the Republic of New Africa Movement\n\n1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:26.320\n and they wanted some states in the South\n\n1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:27.520\n given over to black people\n\n1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:29.480\n and we were gonna have our own country.\n\n1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:33.400\n And that's a joke, it's a fantasy.\n\n1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:37.360\n It's a mythic, unbalanced,\n\n1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:42.360\n the unrealistic fanciful politics.\n\n1:16:46.840 --> 1:16:48.200\n It's not a serious politics.\n\n1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:51.880\n We're Americans, we're not going anywhere here.\n\n1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:54.560\n The idea that, and I wanna say this\n\n1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:56.860\n in a number of different registers,\n\n1:16:56.860 --> 1:16:58.800\n I wanna say first of all,\n\n1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:00.560\n we need to make peace with the fact\n\n1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:03.300\n that that's who we are and that's where we are.\n\n1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:07.760\n So nobody is coming, the world court\n\n1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:10.160\n is not gonna litigate our disputes.\n\n1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:13.120\n The United Nations is not gonna set up a desk\n\n1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.300\n for people of African descent who reside in North America.\n\n1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:20.240\n We have to work out whatever our concerns are\n\n1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:22.260\n with our fellow Americans right here\n\n1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:25.280\n within the context of American politics.\n\n1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.380\n That means compromise.\n\n1:17:27.380 --> 1:17:32.380\n That means looking for a framework for political expression\n\n1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:36.420\n which is broader than our racial identity, et cetera.\n\n1:17:36.420 --> 1:17:38.260\n So I wanna say that.\n\n1:17:38.260 --> 1:17:39.660\n But I also wanna say there's no reason\n\n1:17:39.660 --> 1:17:40.860\n to apologize for this.\n\n1:17:40.860 --> 1:17:42.980\n There's something positive to affirm.\n\n1:17:42.980 --> 1:17:47.500\n I take on this question about slavery in brief,\n\n1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:50.620\n because in fact, slavery was awful and it was wrong\n\n1:17:50.620 --> 1:17:53.900\n and it was on the backs of the enslaved Africans\n\n1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:58.140\n and it had consequences that have endured\n\n1:17:58.140 --> 1:18:00.060\n long after the termination of the thing.\n\n1:18:00.060 --> 1:18:03.020\n But I also wanna say, look at what has happened\n\n1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:07.040\n in the last 150 years for African Americans.\n\n1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:10.660\n And I wanna say, look at the vitality\n\n1:18:10.660 --> 1:18:13.900\n of the institutions here in the United States of America,\n\n1:18:13.900 --> 1:18:17.600\n of the Democratic Republic of the United States of America.\n\n1:18:18.740 --> 1:18:22.580\n Again, not perfect, which are malleable enough,\n\n1:18:22.580 --> 1:18:26.860\n these institutions to allow for the transformation\n\n1:18:26.860 --> 1:18:28.420\n of the status of African Americans\n\n1:18:28.420 --> 1:18:33.140\n such as has occurred since the end of slavery.\n\n1:18:33.140 --> 1:18:35.980\n And I wanna say there's a lot to celebrate in that.\n\n1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:38.300\n So this is our country.\n\n1:18:39.180 --> 1:18:44.340\n We are full members of the polity.\n\n1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:48.460\n We have burdens and responsibilities\n\n1:18:48.460 --> 1:18:50.780\n as well as privileges that are associated\n\n1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:52.880\n with our membership in this Republic.\n\n1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:55.860\n That does not mean that we should not fight\n\n1:18:55.860 --> 1:18:57.480\n for what we believe to be right,\n\n1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:01.740\n although we are not one voice here, we black Americans.\n\n1:19:01.740 --> 1:19:04.340\n It does not mean that we should not protest things\n\n1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:07.260\n that we think are deserving of protest.\n\n1:19:07.260 --> 1:19:11.500\n But I wanna say, it does mean that we should not reject\n\n1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:14.620\n the framework that we're operating in\n\n1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:17.340\n because we basically don't have any alternative.\n\n1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:20.720\n And because when viewed in full context,\n\n1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:25.060\n a noble and profoundly significant achievement,\n\n1:19:25.060 --> 1:19:28.300\n the United States of America and a beacon\n\n1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:30.740\n to the rest of the world, I don't wanna go off\n\n1:19:30.740 --> 1:19:34.700\n in some starry eyed kind of jingoistic celebration\n\n1:19:34.700 --> 1:19:38.180\n of America as the greatest civilization, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:19:38.180 --> 1:19:43.180\n But this great nation is our nation.\n\n1:19:44.900 --> 1:19:47.740\n And I think we do best by beginning,\n\n1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:49.780\n we black Americans do best by beginning,\n\n1:19:49.780 --> 1:19:51.520\n this is my argument in the piece,\n\n1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:56.520\n by beginning from a framework which accepts that fact\n\n1:19:56.900 --> 1:19:58.100\n and then builds on it.\n\n1:20:00.260 --> 1:20:05.260\n So black patriotism is, if not exactly the same,\n\n1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:11.160\n rhymes, echoes American patriotism.\n\n1:20:12.180 --> 1:20:16.020\n So a black American is first and foremost an American.\n\n1:20:16.020 --> 1:20:20.180\n Yeah, a black American is first and foremost an American\n\n1:20:20.180 --> 1:20:21.580\n and it's a good thing too.\n\n1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:29.500\n Let me return to the question of Dr. King\n\n1:20:30.180 --> 1:20:35.180\n and another powerful, impactful individual, Malcolm X,\n\n1:20:35.820 --> 1:20:37.820\n to ask you the question.\n\n1:20:37.820 --> 1:20:42.820\n Well, first, people often perhaps inaccurately portray them\n\n1:20:43.540 --> 1:20:48.540\n as representing two different ideals, approaches\n\n1:20:48.540 --> 1:20:52.020\n to the fight for civil rights.\n\n1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:56.320\n So Martin Luther King for the nonviolent approach,\n\n1:20:56.320 --> 1:21:01.320\n the peacemaker, and Malcolm X is the by any means necessary.\n\n1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:05.300\n What do you think about this distinction?\n\n1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:08.420\n And broadly speaking, in black patriotism,\n\n1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:12.560\n in the future of black Americans in the 21st century,\n\n1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:14.200\n what is the role of anger?\n\n1:21:15.060 --> 1:21:18.260\n What is the role of protest?\n\n1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:22.140\n Even violence encompasses a lot of things,\n\n1:21:22.140 --> 1:21:26.740\n but just aggression and the fuck the man,\n\n1:21:26.740 --> 1:21:29.900\n we're going to have to make change, force change.\n\n1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:33.880\n Okay, I think you put your finger on something\n\n1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:35.740\n really important in the context of,\n\n1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:39.280\n we were just discussing my black patriotism essay.\n\n1:21:41.380 --> 1:21:44.720\n It's not the only story.\n\n1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:47.940\n There is another story and Malcolm X is someone\n\n1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:52.580\n you identify and his memory lives on\n\n1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:54.660\n and is powerfully influential.\n\n1:21:55.620 --> 1:21:58.460\n And I think you see it in Black Lives Matter,\n\n1:21:58.460 --> 1:22:01.960\n and I think you see it in the protest and rioting\n\n1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:04.900\n and so forth that has broken out periodically\n\n1:22:04.900 --> 1:22:07.020\n going all the way back to the 1960s and before,\n\n1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:10.940\n but especially since the 1960s.\n\n1:22:11.860 --> 1:22:14.600\n You saw it in Los Angeles in 1992,\n\n1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:16.580\n the Rodney King civil disturbances\n\n1:22:16.580 --> 1:22:21.400\n that broke out there and the balled up fist,\n\n1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:26.400\n the radical afrocentric rejection\n\n1:22:27.660 --> 1:22:31.700\n of the American story that Martin Luther King,\n\n1:22:31.700 --> 1:22:32.540\n he believed in.\n\n1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:35.300\n He believed in a magnificent promissory note.\n\n1:22:35.300 --> 1:22:37.900\n And a lot of people are rolling their eyes\n\n1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:39.620\n and saying, as you say,\n\n1:22:39.620 --> 1:22:42.180\n fuck the man, magnificent promissory note.\n\n1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:46.100\n I mean, just get your knee off my neck.\n\n1:22:46.100 --> 1:22:47.220\n That's what you can do for me.\n\n1:22:47.220 --> 1:22:49.260\n Don't ask me to believe in your BS\n\n1:22:49.260 --> 1:22:51.220\n about some magnificent promissory note,\n\n1:22:51.220 --> 1:22:54.660\n some founding fathers who were all slave owners anyway.\n\n1:22:54.660 --> 1:22:56.560\n I mean, just get your knee off my neck.\n\n1:22:57.780 --> 1:22:59.820\n Now, I can relate to that.\n\n1:23:00.700 --> 1:23:05.060\n As I mentioned, I grew up in Chicago in the 1950s\n\n1:23:05.060 --> 1:23:06.220\n and the 1960s.\n\n1:23:06.220 --> 1:23:10.160\n I remember Malcolm X, I mean, literally in real time.\n\n1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:14.300\n I remember when he was murdered in 1965\n\n1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:18.100\n in the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem,\n\n1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:21.160\n in Manhattan, in New York City.\n\n1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:26.300\n I remember my uncle, I was raised in a house\n\n1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:29.820\n where my aunt and uncle were the master of the house.\n\n1:23:29.820 --> 1:23:31.660\n And my mother and my sister and I lived\n\n1:23:31.660 --> 1:23:35.240\n in a small apartment upstairs in the back\n\n1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:40.240\n of this big house that my successful aunt and uncle owned.\n\n1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:42.660\n And my uncle was a small businessman,\n\n1:23:42.660 --> 1:23:46.020\n a barber and a tradesman.\n\n1:23:46.020 --> 1:23:47.580\n He was a hustler.\n\n1:23:47.580 --> 1:23:50.500\n I mean, legally, he did what he had to do to make money.\n\n1:23:50.500 --> 1:23:53.840\n He was a very enterprising, not especially well educated,\n\n1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:57.380\n but a very intelligent and disciplined\n\n1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:01.640\n and resourceful provider for his family,\n\n1:24:01.640 --> 1:24:04.500\n which included myself, my sister,\n\n1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:07.060\n and my mother in their household.\n\n1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:08.500\n And we called him Uncle Mooney\n\n1:24:08.500 --> 1:24:10.940\n because he had moon shaped eyes\n\n1:24:10.940 --> 1:24:12.380\n that protruded and were round.\n\n1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:16.980\n Uncle Mooney, James Ellis was his name.\n\n1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:21.720\n Uncle Mooney, James Ellis Lee was my Uncle Mooney.\n\n1:24:21.720 --> 1:24:24.380\n But I'm saying all that to say this.\n\n1:24:24.380 --> 1:24:27.060\n He admired the nation of Islam.\n\n1:24:27.060 --> 1:24:29.900\n I mean, King and Malcolm X,\n\n1:24:29.900 --> 1:24:31.660\n Martin King and Malcolm X differed\n\n1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:33.040\n along a number of different dimensions.\n\n1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:34.420\n Malcolm X was a Muslim.\n\n1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:37.900\n And Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian minister.\n\n1:24:39.340 --> 1:24:41.940\n My Uncle Mooney didn't have any time\n\n1:24:41.940 --> 1:24:44.140\n for these Christian ministers.\n\n1:24:44.140 --> 1:24:46.340\n He thought that was the white man's religion.\n\n1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:50.700\n And back in that day, you'd go into a black church\n\n1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:53.340\n and you'd see a portrait of Jesus\n\n1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:57.300\n and he'd be blonde hair, blue eyed.\n\n1:24:57.300 --> 1:25:00.620\n He didn't even look like a Mediterranean.\n\n1:25:00.620 --> 1:25:03.620\n I mean, he didn't look like somebody who came from Palestine.\n\n1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:05.660\n I mean, he looked like somebody who came\n\n1:25:05.660 --> 1:25:07.180\n from Northern Europe or something like that,\n\n1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:08.020\n the picture of Jesus.\n\n1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:11.020\n And my Uncle Mooney rejected that whole thing.\n\n1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:13.980\n He would be damned if he was gonna bend his knee\n\n1:25:13.980 --> 1:25:16.380\n to some white Jesus.\n\n1:25:17.700 --> 1:25:19.640\n But he was not a Muslim either.\n\n1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:22.060\n But he respected the Muslims.\n\n1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:24.060\n He brought home their newspaper.\n\n1:25:24.060 --> 1:25:25.500\n It was called Muhammad Speaks.\n\n1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:28.100\n This is the nation of Islam,\n\n1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:30.720\n which is the black Muslim movement\n\n1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:35.720\n founded in American cities in Detroit and then Chicago,\n\n1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:40.380\n going back to the early middle 20th century\n\n1:25:40.380 --> 1:25:43.800\n and growing into a very significant movement\n\n1:25:43.800 --> 1:25:44.980\n that had a lot of influence,\n\n1:25:44.980 --> 1:25:48.700\n Louis Farrakhan and controversial figure\n\n1:25:48.700 --> 1:25:50.020\n descends from this movement.\n\n1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:53.180\n It has fractured now\n\n1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:58.180\n and has the major part of the legacy of the black Muslims\n\n1:25:59.940 --> 1:26:03.260\n has assimilated itself into Islam proper.\n\n1:26:04.220 --> 1:26:08.780\n Malcolm X made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina\n\n1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:11.220\n and came back with a very different vision\n\n1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:12.880\n about what it meant to be a Muslim\n\n1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:16.700\n and understood himself to be a part of the large tradition\n\n1:26:16.700 --> 1:26:20.600\n and religious culture of Islam that has a global reach.\n\n1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.940\n And he had a different vision when he came back from that.\n\n1:26:23.940 --> 1:26:27.300\n Some people say that's why he was killed and so on.\n\n1:26:27.300 --> 1:26:28.500\n I don't know.\n\n1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:30.340\n I certainly find that to be plausible\n\n1:26:30.340 --> 1:26:34.220\n that he became the constituted threat to the sect,\n\n1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:36.740\n which was the black Muslims\n\n1:26:36.740 --> 1:26:39.380\n and had to be dealt with.\n\n1:26:40.420 --> 1:26:43.300\n I don't know if we'll ever know the full story on that.\n\n1:26:43.300 --> 1:26:45.620\n But anyway, what I'm trying to say is\n\n1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:47.780\n the black Muslims were there, Malcolm X was there.\n\n1:26:47.780 --> 1:26:51.140\n And in my experience,\n\n1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:55.780\n they constituted a counterpoint to the position of king,\n\n1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:59.660\n which depended on a kind of respect\n\n1:26:59.660 --> 1:27:04.660\n for the best of the tradition of American democracy,\n\n1:27:04.660 --> 1:27:09.100\n appealing to the better nature of our oppressors,\n\n1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:12.420\n live up to the full meaning of our creed.\n\n1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:14.660\n I mean, these are words that he would use.\n\n1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:18.220\n A magnificent promissory note is what he would think of\n\n1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:20.020\n as the declaration of independence\n\n1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:23.220\n and the legacy of Abraham Lincoln,\n\n1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:25.660\n a unfulfilled ideal.\n\n1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:30.660\n And the black Muslims were like, fuck that.\n\n1:27:30.660 --> 1:27:32.460\n We're gonna take care of our own.\n\n1:27:32.460 --> 1:27:35.780\n We're gonna build our own schools.\n\n1:27:35.780 --> 1:27:37.860\n We're gonna build our own businesses.\n\n1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:41.140\n We're not waiting for the white man to do anything.\n\n1:27:41.140 --> 1:27:43.140\n Get your knee off my neck and get out of my way\n\n1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:44.980\n and let me take care of my own.\n\n1:27:44.980 --> 1:27:46.300\n And my uncle respected that.\n\n1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.740\n He respected the straight back,\n\n1:27:48.740 --> 1:27:51.220\n the stand up straight with your shoulders back.\n\n1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:52.060\n That's a Jordan Peterson.\n\n1:27:52.060 --> 1:27:54.820\n But I mean, that was way before Jordan Peterson,\n\n1:27:54.820 --> 1:27:56.140\n but that was his philosophy.\n\n1:27:56.140 --> 1:27:58.980\n Stand up straight, but just raise your children.\n\n1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:01.060\n Don't be depending upon welfare.\n\n1:28:01.060 --> 1:28:03.740\n You're taking welfare from the white man.\n\n1:28:03.740 --> 1:28:04.740\n You need to get busy.\n\n1:28:04.740 --> 1:28:06.380\n You need to educate yourself.\n\n1:28:06.380 --> 1:28:07.500\n You need to clean up your act.\n\n1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:11.180\n Put down the fried chicken because it's gonna kill you.\n\n1:28:11.180 --> 1:28:16.180\n My uncle Mooney loved this book that Elijah Muhammad,\n\n1:28:16.180 --> 1:28:19.100\n they called him the honorable Elijah Muhammad,\n\n1:28:19.100 --> 1:28:22.220\n who was the founder and the leader of the nation of Islam.\n\n1:28:22.220 --> 1:28:25.660\n He had a book and all the book said was,\n\n1:28:25.660 --> 1:28:29.620\n be smart, eat green vegetables, don't eat fried food.\n\n1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:32.620\n Don't eat pork.\n\n1:28:32.620 --> 1:28:33.780\n They're Muslims.\n\n1:28:33.780 --> 1:28:38.380\n Don't eat pork and take responsibility for your diet\n\n1:28:38.380 --> 1:28:39.820\n and be healthy.\n\n1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:43.420\n And don't be putting a whole lot of pills into your body.\n\n1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:44.300\n You don't need to do that\n\n1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:45.940\n if you just get control of your diet\n\n1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:47.820\n and you eat properly.\n\n1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:52.820\n My uncle loves this idea of responsibility for self\n\n1:28:53.660 --> 1:28:56.500\n and a determination to build.\n\n1:28:56.500 --> 1:29:00.060\n He respected that in the Muslims,\n\n1:29:00.060 --> 1:29:02.900\n even if he didn't buy the religious part of it.\n\n1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:08.740\n And so, and by the way, when my uncle died in 1983,\n\n1:29:13.220 --> 1:29:15.020\n he left me a bequest.\n\n1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:18.060\n It wasn't money, unfortunately.\n\n1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:21.700\n It was his complete collection\n\n1:29:21.700 --> 1:29:26.700\n of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.\n\n1:29:26.700 --> 1:29:28.220\n And I have these albums.\n\n1:29:28.220 --> 1:29:30.180\n These are 33 and a third LPs.\n\n1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:31.300\n There's six of them.\n\n1:29:32.580 --> 1:29:34.700\n And I have a complete collection,\n\n1:29:34.700 --> 1:29:36.140\n as best as my uncle could assemble,\n\n1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:37.580\n of the recorded speeches of Malcolm X.\n\n1:29:37.580 --> 1:29:39.220\n Now, why did he do that?\n\n1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:42.300\n He did that because he did not want me to forget.\n\n1:29:42.300 --> 1:29:43.940\n Don't be dependent upon the white man.\n\n1:29:43.940 --> 1:29:45.580\n Build your own.\n\n1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:48.060\n Stand up straight with your shoulders back.\n\n1:29:48.060 --> 1:29:51.540\n Proud black man, take care of your business.\n\n1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:53.540\n Take care of your children.\n\n1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:56.380\n Pick up the trash in front of your house.\n\n1:29:56.380 --> 1:29:57.500\n Get busy.\n\n1:29:58.860 --> 1:30:00.460\n This was this philosophy.\n\n1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:05.620\n So violence now, that's another story.\n\n1:30:05.620 --> 1:30:08.500\n I mean, Malcolm X would say,\n\n1:30:08.500 --> 1:30:09.820\n we're gonna defend ourselves.\n\n1:30:09.820 --> 1:30:11.380\n You're gonna mess with us,\n\n1:30:11.380 --> 1:30:14.300\n you racist Ku Klux Klan or whatever.\n\n1:30:14.300 --> 1:30:17.500\n We're gonna arm ourselves and we're gonna fight you back.\n\n1:30:17.500 --> 1:30:22.020\n You racist police who are oppressing\n\n1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:24.620\n and persecuting and abusing our people,\n\n1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:27.060\n well, you better be ready\n\n1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:28.780\n because we're gonna fight you back.\n\n1:30:29.820 --> 1:30:33.380\n And that too was the spirit that my uncle,\n\n1:30:33.380 --> 1:30:36.140\n that was a kind of attitude, a kind of posture.\n\n1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:37.300\n My uncle was not a radical.\n\n1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:41.820\n He was a businessman, but he respected this idea.\n\n1:30:41.820 --> 1:30:45.940\n You take your life in your own hands when you mess with us\n\n1:30:45.940 --> 1:30:48.500\n because we're prepared to defend ourselves.\n\n1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:50.300\n So that blood runs in you too.\n\n1:30:50.300 --> 1:30:53.500\n That thread is, when you write about black patriotism,\n\n1:30:53.500 --> 1:30:55.420\n that thread is there too.\n\n1:30:55.420 --> 1:31:00.420\n It's like you embody both the ideal that we're all American,\n\n1:31:00.900 --> 1:31:05.420\n but also that there is this oppressive history.\n\n1:31:05.420 --> 1:31:10.420\n There is the powerful that are manipulating you,\n\n1:31:10.420 --> 1:31:15.420\n that are oppressing you, and you can't just wait around\n\n1:31:16.300 --> 1:31:18.420\n for things to fix themselves.\n\n1:31:18.420 --> 1:31:20.940\n You have to take action.\n\n1:31:20.940 --> 1:31:22.820\n You have to take things into your own hands.\n\n1:31:22.820 --> 1:31:24.660\n And sometimes that means being angry.\n\n1:31:24.660 --> 1:31:26.820\n Sometimes that means being violent.\n\n1:31:26.820 --> 1:31:27.980\n That's there too.\n\n1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:33.300\n Yeah, it's there, but here, and the but is,\n\n1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:37.580\n I don't, me today, Glenn Loury in 2022,\n\n1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:40.460\n think that that is the answer.\n\n1:31:40.460 --> 1:31:45.260\n I don't think that violent rebellion gets us anywhere\n\n1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:46.700\n at the end of the day.\n\n1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:49.900\n I think we're past that.\n\n1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:52.860\n There aren't Knight Rider, Ku Klux Klan,\n\n1:31:52.860 --> 1:31:55.740\n people breaking down your door and dragging you away.\n\n1:31:55.740 --> 1:32:00.740\n There are not nooses thrown over a tree limb\n\n1:32:01.980 --> 1:32:03.580\n where you hang somebody from the tree\n\n1:32:03.580 --> 1:32:05.420\n because they whistled at a white woman\n\n1:32:05.420 --> 1:32:07.980\n or they got too much property in your community\n\n1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:10.260\n and you became, they were uppity Negroes\n\n1:32:10.260 --> 1:32:11.100\n and whatnot like that.\n\n1:32:11.100 --> 1:32:14.860\n That is a thing of the past in America\n\n1:32:14.860 --> 1:32:19.380\n that the situation is no longer the one\n\n1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:23.140\n that requires that kind of violent reaction\n\n1:32:23.140 --> 1:32:27.660\n and that there is, if we look at the net effect\n\n1:32:27.660 --> 1:32:32.660\n of the so called rebellions in American cities,\n\n1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:34.860\n they're negative.\n\n1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:39.860\n The George Floyd protests, which became violent\n\n1:32:40.620 --> 1:32:44.180\n and arsonists in the aftermath of civil disturbance\n\n1:32:44.180 --> 1:32:47.100\n and whatnot in the summer of 2020,\n\n1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:50.940\n I think set back the program for African Americans.\n\n1:32:50.940 --> 1:32:52.380\n I don't think it advanced it.\n\n1:32:53.700 --> 1:32:56.980\n I think there are things to be concerned about,\n\n1:32:56.980 --> 1:32:59.180\n schools that are not working,\n\n1:32:59.180 --> 1:33:02.620\n police that are not respecting citizens and so forth.\n\n1:33:02.620 --> 1:33:04.980\n But I think that those are things\n\n1:33:04.980 --> 1:33:07.660\n that affect white Americans as well\n\n1:33:07.660 --> 1:33:12.660\n and that the way to ultimately correct those things\n\n1:33:13.700 --> 1:33:18.700\n is to make alliance and associate oneself\n\n1:33:19.860 --> 1:33:23.300\n with Americans who are concerned to change these things.\n\n1:33:23.300 --> 1:33:25.820\n And I don't think it's properly framed\n\n1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:29.020\n as a racial problem.\n\n1:33:29.020 --> 1:33:34.020\n I certainly don't think that violent rebellion\n\n1:33:36.780 --> 1:33:37.860\n gets us anywhere.\n\n1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:44.260\n I get the historical salience of that posture\n\n1:33:45.060 --> 1:33:47.180\n and it made a lot of sense\n\n1:33:47.180 --> 1:33:49.980\n in the early and the mid 20th century.\n\n1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:51.780\n I don't think it makes very much sense at all\n\n1:33:51.780 --> 1:33:53.460\n in the early 21st century.\n\n1:33:55.100 --> 1:33:57.620\n Well, thank you for allowing me for a brief moment\n\n1:33:57.620 --> 1:33:59.860\n to try to channel your Uncle Mooney\n\n1:33:59.860 --> 1:34:02.300\n and maybe Malcolm X in this conversation\n\n1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:05.300\n as we look forward to the 21st century.\n\n1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:09.380\n You mentioned that in part,\n\n1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:13.020\n you're troubled by the term African American.\n\n1:34:13.020 --> 1:34:18.020\n So words are funny things until they're not.\n\n1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:20.860\n So let me ask you about what I think\n\n1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:22.900\n is one of the most powerful and controversial words\n\n1:34:22.900 --> 1:34:25.580\n in the English language, the N word.\n\n1:34:25.580 --> 1:34:30.580\n So this is a word that I can't say\n\n1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:34.860\n that only certain people have the right to say.\n\n1:34:34.860 --> 1:34:38.900\n I have a friend, Joe Rogan, who has,\n\n1:34:40.900 --> 1:34:43.980\n what would you say, there was mass pushback\n\n1:34:43.980 --> 1:34:48.180\n or highlighting of the fact that he didn't just say N word\n\n1:34:48.180 --> 1:34:51.980\n but said the full word many times\n\n1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:53.740\n throughout his conversations\n\n1:34:53.740 --> 1:34:58.340\n when referring to, in a meta way,\n\n1:34:58.340 --> 1:35:00.540\n about the power of words,\n\n1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:03.460\n especially when related to certain comedians\n\n1:35:03.460 --> 1:35:04.700\n using those words.\n\n1:35:06.420 --> 1:35:07.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:09.300\n What do you think about this word?\n\n1:35:10.380 --> 1:35:12.700\n Is it empowering?\n\n1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:14.340\n Is it destructive?\n\n1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:17.580\n What is it?\n\n1:35:17.580 --> 1:35:20.700\n What does it mean for race in America?\n\n1:35:20.700 --> 1:35:24.500\n What does it mean that people like Joe Rogan\n\n1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:29.500\n were essentially, there's an attack to cancel him\n\n1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:31.180\n for using the word?\n\n1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:33.820\n Just as a scholar of human nature,\n\n1:35:33.820 --> 1:35:36.140\n what do you think about this whole thing?\n\n1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:39.140\n This is a phenomenon that interests me.\n\n1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:40.580\n Okay.\n\n1:35:40.580 --> 1:35:44.860\n The N word, nigger, I can say it because I'm black.\n\n1:35:44.860 --> 1:35:48.060\n But I mean, I can also say it because I like hip hop.\n\n1:35:48.060 --> 1:35:50.540\n And when I listen to hip hop, I hear the word all the time.\n\n1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:52.420\n These niggas ain't, you know,\n\n1:35:52.420 --> 1:35:54.460\n you better watch out for these, et cetera.\n\n1:35:55.620 --> 1:35:59.020\n I heard the word constantly as I was growing up\n\n1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.700\n as a boy and a young man in Chicago.\n\n1:36:01.700 --> 1:36:03.340\n Niggas ain't shit.\n\n1:36:03.340 --> 1:36:04.780\n That was said.\n\n1:36:04.780 --> 1:36:06.420\n That was, you know,\n\n1:36:06.420 --> 1:36:10.380\n and that could be a reflection of some kind of pathology\n\n1:36:10.380 --> 1:36:13.060\n within the African American community of self hatred\n\n1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:14.140\n and so forth.\n\n1:36:14.140 --> 1:36:18.340\n It could be, or it could just be a colloquial linguistic way.\n\n1:36:18.340 --> 1:36:23.220\n I mean, I assume other groups also have their various,\n\n1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:26.500\n I don't know how the Irish talk about their Irish brothers\n\n1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:27.740\n and, you know, whatever.\n\n1:36:27.740 --> 1:36:30.660\n And I don't know how the Jews talk about\n\n1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:33.260\n the Jewish brothers and whatever.\n\n1:36:33.260 --> 1:36:35.820\n But black people, when talking about other black people\n\n1:36:35.820 --> 1:36:39.180\n use the N word all the time.\n\n1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:45.220\n My nigger, N I G G A, you know, my nigger.\n\n1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:48.020\n That is a term of endearment.\n\n1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:50.980\n My friend, Randall Kennedy,\n\n1:36:52.740 --> 1:36:55.220\n the law professor at Harvard University\n\n1:36:55.220 --> 1:36:57.460\n has a book called Nigger.\n\n1:36:57.460 --> 1:37:00.260\n And he uses the word in the title of the book,\n\n1:37:00.260 --> 1:37:04.860\n the history of a strange history of a provocative word.\n\n1:37:04.860 --> 1:37:06.060\n At some point there's a subtitle,\n\n1:37:06.060 --> 1:37:11.060\n but the title of the book is N I G G E R colon.\n\n1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:15.460\n And then he has a subtitle.\n\n1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:20.380\n I think, of course, the use of the word as a slur\n\n1:37:20.380 --> 1:37:25.380\n and an insult, which is a part of the history\n\n1:37:26.100 --> 1:37:27.860\n of black people in the United States,\n\n1:37:27.860 --> 1:37:31.820\n the use of the word by the Southern racist segregationist,\n\n1:37:31.820 --> 1:37:33.340\n we don't want no niggers up in here.\n\n1:37:33.340 --> 1:37:36.100\n Yall, you know, niggers have no place in my restaurant,\n\n1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:37.940\n in my store, et cetera.\n\n1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:40.140\n That's meant to be an insult.\n\n1:37:40.140 --> 1:37:41.260\n It's an insult to people.\n\n1:37:41.260 --> 1:37:42.180\n It's a fighting word.\n\n1:37:42.180 --> 1:37:44.940\n It's a way that you say that to somebody.\n\n1:37:44.940 --> 1:37:47.940\n It's a invitation for conflict.\n\n1:37:49.020 --> 1:37:52.820\n That said, what is it that about this particular word\n\n1:37:52.820 --> 1:37:55.180\n and also the asymmetry of it,\n\n1:37:55.180 --> 1:37:57.500\n that do you think it's empowering\n\n1:37:57.500 --> 1:38:01.300\n to the black community to own a word?\n\n1:38:04.060 --> 1:38:06.020\n My honest answer to you is I don't know.\n\n1:38:06.020 --> 1:38:08.180\n I don't fully understand it.\n\n1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:10.860\n It has become symbolic in a way.\n\n1:38:10.860 --> 1:38:13.300\n And the policing of the use of the word,\n\n1:38:13.300 --> 1:38:15.380\n I can say it, but white people can't say it.\n\n1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:16.220\n I can say it.\n\n1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:17.060\n I'm not a racist.\n\n1:38:17.060 --> 1:38:19.020\n I'm not a self hating black.\n\n1:38:19.020 --> 1:38:24.020\n I'm just speaking the language of colloquial English\n\n1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:26.660\n that has emerged amongst African Americans\n\n1:38:26.660 --> 1:38:29.140\n in which that word plays a big role.\n\n1:38:29.140 --> 1:38:32.060\n But the prohibition on its use by others.\n\n1:38:32.060 --> 1:38:34.660\n And of course, in the Joe Rogan case,\n\n1:38:34.660 --> 1:38:38.620\n it wasn't as if he was calling anybody an N word.\n\n1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:42.100\n He was simply pointing out that people had said stuff\n\n1:38:42.100 --> 1:38:44.860\n in which the N word was a part of what they said.\n\n1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:46.780\n Now, he did make the statement about,\n\n1:38:47.820 --> 1:38:48.660\n how did he put it?\n\n1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:49.500\n The planet of the apes,\n\n1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:52.980\n that one of the offensive things that he said,\n\n1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:53.820\n he walked into a room,\n\n1:38:53.820 --> 1:38:55.220\n there's a bunch of black guys standing around.\n\n1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:57.100\n He says, like planet of the apes.\n\n1:38:57.100 --> 1:38:59.580\n He said it's like Africa, planet of the apes.\n\n1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:03.060\n Yeah, he should have been a little bit more careful.\n\n1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:05.260\n That was an insult.\n\n1:39:05.260 --> 1:39:10.260\n That was something that if you say that\n\n1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:12.100\n and people are offended,\n\n1:39:12.100 --> 1:39:13.180\n they have a right to be offended.\n\n1:39:13.180 --> 1:39:14.580\n And if you didn't mean to offend them,\n\n1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:15.420\n you can apologize.\n\n1:39:15.420 --> 1:39:16.380\n And he did apologize.\n\n1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:17.940\n I accept his apology.\n\n1:39:17.940 --> 1:39:20.500\n Joe's okay with me as far as that goes.\n\n1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:25.380\n In fact, John McWhorter and I at the podcast that I do,\n\n1:39:25.380 --> 1:39:26.940\n The Glenn Show, had a conversation,\n\n1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:29.300\n part of which touched on the Joe Rogan phenomenon.\n\n1:39:29.300 --> 1:39:31.580\n And we concluded he didn't really do anything wrong.\n\n1:39:31.580 --> 1:39:34.740\n I mean, you can like or you can hate him or whatever,\n\n1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:37.980\n but the idea that he's a racist is kind of ridiculous.\n\n1:39:37.980 --> 1:39:42.980\n So frankly, I mean, if that's your test\n\n1:39:43.140 --> 1:39:46.020\n of what constitutes a racist, the utterance of the word,\n\n1:39:47.780 --> 1:39:52.780\n then it's kind of silly as far as I'm concerned.\n\n1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:58.180\n What do you think about the rigorous testing of people\n\n1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:00.900\n to the degree they're racist or not?\n\n1:40:00.900 --> 1:40:05.900\n The accusation of racism being a way to attack,\n\n1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:09.780\n to bully, to divide.\n\n1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:13.180\n So what are the pros and cons of that once again?\n\n1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:16.060\n Because it does reveal the assholes and the racists,\n\n1:40:16.060 --> 1:40:20.420\n but it can hurt people who are not.\n\n1:40:20.420 --> 1:40:25.420\n Well, I think we have a history here in the United States\n\n1:40:26.020 --> 1:40:30.660\n of blatant racism that goes back a long way.\n\n1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:32.940\n And that has present day echoes.\n\n1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:35.860\n So there are racists.\n\n1:40:35.860 --> 1:40:38.340\n I mean, there are people who will look and see,\n\n1:40:38.340 --> 1:40:39.540\n oh, those are black people.\n\n1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:40.820\n They're patronizing this business.\n\n1:40:40.820 --> 1:40:42.860\n I don't wanna patronize this business anymore.\n\n1:40:42.860 --> 1:40:45.700\n Who if their daughter or their son is dating somebody\n\n1:40:45.700 --> 1:40:47.660\n that is black, they will say,\n\n1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:48.980\n I really wish you wouldn't do that.\n\n1:40:48.980 --> 1:40:50.620\n I mean, why are you hanging out with those people?\n\n1:40:50.620 --> 1:40:52.460\n Don't you know who they are?\n\n1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:54.780\n There are people, there are racists, okay?\n\n1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:56.420\n There are black racists.\n\n1:40:56.420 --> 1:40:59.580\n That is black people who see somebody who's white\n\n1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:03.260\n and who then invoke a whole lot of stereotypes or whatever,\n\n1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:08.260\n or have a visceral dislike based upon nothing\n\n1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:11.060\n other than the color of the person's skin.\n\n1:41:11.060 --> 1:41:12.180\n Such people exist.\n\n1:41:12.180 --> 1:41:15.020\n Racism is a real thing, et cetera.\n\n1:41:15.020 --> 1:41:18.780\n On the other hand, I think this,\n\n1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:22.820\n throwing around the accusation of racism,\n\n1:41:22.820 --> 1:41:25.740\n a college professor is teaching a course.\n\n1:41:25.740 --> 1:41:29.060\n He says in the context of teaching the course\n\n1:41:29.060 --> 1:41:33.860\n that the underrepresentation of blacks\n\n1:41:33.860 --> 1:41:38.060\n in physics program at this university\n\n1:41:38.060 --> 1:41:41.900\n is because they score lower on the test than other groups\n\n1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:44.340\n and they're not qualified.\n\n1:41:44.340 --> 1:41:48.740\n So say the professor gives a lecture and he says,\n\n1:41:48.740 --> 1:41:50.660\n we don't have more blacks in the physics department\n\n1:41:50.660 --> 1:41:52.340\n at this university because there are not enough\n\n1:41:52.340 --> 1:41:54.180\n qualified blacks.\n\n1:41:54.180 --> 1:41:57.140\n Somebody in the classroom who hears that,\n\n1:41:57.140 --> 1:41:59.300\n a black student, objects.\n\n1:41:59.300 --> 1:42:01.820\n He's a racist, okay?\n\n1:42:03.100 --> 1:42:04.500\n That's a power move.\n\n1:42:05.460 --> 1:42:10.020\n It's a move to try to control the conversation.\n\n1:42:10.020 --> 1:42:12.700\n It's not an argument, it's an epithet.\n\n1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:16.540\n You've said that a person who has a particular idea\n\n1:42:16.540 --> 1:42:18.460\n that you don't like, maybe that idea is,\n\n1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:21.220\n I'm against affirmative action, I think it's unfair.\n\n1:42:21.220 --> 1:42:24.620\n I was just with Dorian Abbott.\n\n1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:29.620\n Dorian Abbott is a scientist at the University of Chicago\n\n1:42:30.060 --> 1:42:33.860\n who published a piece in Newsweek magazine\n\n1:42:33.860 --> 1:42:36.620\n in which he said that he thought affirmative action\n\n1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:41.060\n and racial balancing was unethical.\n\n1:42:42.540 --> 1:42:44.660\n He was invited to give a lecture at MIT,\n\n1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:46.420\n a very distinguished lecture in his field\n\n1:42:46.420 --> 1:42:49.180\n based on planetary science.\n\n1:42:49.180 --> 1:42:51.340\n I don't know exactly what it is.\n\n1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:53.580\n I'm not a scientist.\n\n1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:58.220\n But in any case, because he had said\n\n1:42:58.220 --> 1:42:59.820\n that he didn't like affirmative action\n\n1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:01.620\n and he thought affirmative action was racist,\n\n1:43:01.620 --> 1:43:02.740\n that's basically what he said.\n\n1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:05.140\n Why are we looking at people based upon their race\n\n1:43:05.140 --> 1:43:07.260\n and decide we should just do it on the merit?\n\n1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:08.980\n That was his position.\n\n1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:12.220\n Now, people protesting at the university\n\n1:43:12.220 --> 1:43:15.940\n where he was invited, MIT, saying that he's a racist\n\n1:43:15.940 --> 1:43:17.500\n because he had that opinion.\n\n1:43:17.500 --> 1:43:19.020\n He gets disinvited.\n\n1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:24.020\n Charles Murray is a popular social science writer\n\n1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:29.700\n who is famous for his book about IQ, The Bell Curve,\n\n1:43:29.700 --> 1:43:34.380\n one chapter of which chronicles the racial differences\n\n1:43:34.380 --> 1:43:37.180\n between black and white in performance\n\n1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:41.500\n on mental ability tests and speculates about the extent\n\n1:43:41.500 --> 1:43:43.900\n to which such differences may be connected\n\n1:43:43.900 --> 1:43:48.180\n with the genetic inheritance of these racially diverse people.\n\n1:43:48.180 --> 1:43:51.020\n Now, he could be wrong about everything that he's saying.\n\n1:43:52.420 --> 1:43:57.060\n The Southern Poverty Law Center calls him a white supremacist\n\n1:43:57.060 --> 1:44:02.060\n because he observes that there are racial differences\n\n1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:07.060\n in measured intellectual ability amongst Americans\n\n1:44:07.060 --> 1:44:08.740\n of different racial descent.\n\n1:44:10.660 --> 1:44:12.060\n He could be wrong.\n\n1:44:12.060 --> 1:44:13.500\n Let me stipulate that he is wrong.\n\n1:44:13.500 --> 1:44:15.980\n I mean, I don't wanna argue about whether he's right\n\n1:44:15.980 --> 1:44:16.820\n or wrong.\n\n1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:18.540\n I don't wanna argue about whether he's right\n\n1:44:18.540 --> 1:44:20.460\n or about whether he's wrong.\n\n1:44:20.460 --> 1:44:24.660\n He's addressing himself to a factual issue.\n\n1:44:24.660 --> 1:44:27.780\n And now the issue becomes instead of grappling\n\n1:44:27.780 --> 1:44:29.900\n with the factual questions at hand\n\n1:44:29.900 --> 1:44:32.140\n and demonstrating his rightness or wrongness\n\n1:44:32.140 --> 1:44:35.740\n about those questions, the issue becomes his character.\n\n1:44:35.740 --> 1:44:37.020\n He's a racist.\n\n1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:43.140\n That's, in my mind, a lot like calling him a witch.\n\n1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:48.140\n And the use of that word now, I think,\n\n1:44:48.140 --> 1:44:53.140\n has parallels to accusing people of witchcraft\n\n1:44:53.940 --> 1:44:56.980\n because they have views about substantive questions\n\n1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:01.220\n that bear on racial inequality or racial difference\n\n1:45:01.220 --> 1:45:04.180\n that a person finds unacceptable\n\n1:45:04.180 --> 1:45:05.500\n or that a person disagrees with.\n\n1:45:05.500 --> 1:45:07.620\n And you think you can shut somebody up.\n\n1:45:07.620 --> 1:45:12.620\n Crime in the cities of Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore,\n\n1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:18.300\n Philadelphia, Washington, DC is out of control,\n\n1:45:18.300 --> 1:45:20.020\n some person might say.\n\n1:45:20.020 --> 1:45:21.620\n Murder rate is high.\n\n1:45:21.620 --> 1:45:22.980\n Who's committing those crimes?\n\n1:45:22.980 --> 1:45:27.300\n They're mostly black young men who are doing the carjackings\n\n1:45:27.300 --> 1:45:28.460\n and who are doing the shootings.\n\n1:45:28.460 --> 1:45:29.740\n They're killing each other.\n\n1:45:29.740 --> 1:45:32.260\n They're making our city unlivable.\n\n1:45:32.260 --> 1:45:35.940\n Now, that's a hypothetical statement that I offer.\n\n1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:39.260\n It might be correct, it might be incorrect.\n\n1:45:39.260 --> 1:45:42.060\n It might be appropriate, it might be inappropriate.\n\n1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:45.540\n It may be true, but something that we would be better off\n\n1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:47.980\n if people didn't focus on, I don't know.\n\n1:45:49.420 --> 1:45:52.060\n Responding to someone making that statement,\n\n1:45:52.060 --> 1:45:55.060\n have you seen what has happened to my city?\n\n1:45:55.060 --> 1:45:57.860\n It used to be that you could go to North Michigan Avenue\n\n1:45:57.860 --> 1:45:59.700\n and you could find one after another\n\n1:45:59.700 --> 1:46:01.100\n after another high end shop.\n\n1:46:01.100 --> 1:46:03.420\n This is in Chicago, my hometown.\n\n1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:07.140\n And tourists would come and they'd go to the theater\n\n1:46:07.140 --> 1:46:08.940\n and there were restaurants and they'd go out.\n\n1:46:08.940 --> 1:46:10.180\n They don't do it anymore.\n\n1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:11.020\n You know what?\n\n1:46:11.020 --> 1:46:12.180\n Half of those stores are boarded up now.\n\n1:46:12.180 --> 1:46:13.380\n You know why?\n\n1:46:13.380 --> 1:46:15.540\n Because when George Floyd was killed,\n\n1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:19.540\n black people mobbed in the city and they burnt\n\n1:46:19.540 --> 1:46:21.180\n and they rioted and they looted\n\n1:46:21.180 --> 1:46:22.980\n and it hasn't been the same ever since.\n\n1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.820\n And I'm moving to the suburbs.\n\n1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:26.860\n I'll be damned if I'm gonna send my children\n\n1:46:26.860 --> 1:46:27.700\n to those schools.\n\n1:46:27.700 --> 1:46:29.300\n A person could say that.\n\n1:46:29.300 --> 1:46:31.380\n They might be right, they might be wrong to say it.\n\n1:46:31.380 --> 1:46:33.420\n They might be right, they might be wrong to say it.\n\n1:46:33.420 --> 1:46:36.140\n Calling them a racist is exactly not\n\n1:46:37.020 --> 1:46:38.940\n a rebuttal of what they said.\n\n1:46:38.940 --> 1:46:39.860\n It's a move.\n\n1:46:39.860 --> 1:46:43.460\n It's a move to try to take control of the conversation\n\n1:46:43.460 --> 1:46:45.700\n by accusing someone of having bad character\n\n1:46:45.700 --> 1:46:48.180\n because they said something that made you uncomfortable,\n\n1:46:48.180 --> 1:46:49.540\n which you can't deal with.\n\n1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:52.740\n So you think you can shut them up by calling them a racist.\n\n1:46:52.740 --> 1:46:55.020\n You might as well be calling them a witch.\n\n1:46:55.020 --> 1:46:57.060\n You might as well be calling for their head on a platter\n\n1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:00.100\n because they believe that Satan is Lord\n\n1:47:00.100 --> 1:47:04.420\n because that's the kind of quote argument, close quote,\n\n1:47:04.420 --> 1:47:06.300\n which is precisely not an argument\n\n1:47:07.380 --> 1:47:09.780\n that people who invoke that term are using.\n\n1:47:09.780 --> 1:47:12.140\n And here's what I have to say about that.\n\n1:47:12.140 --> 1:47:17.140\n It's a fool's errand to try to refute somebody\n\n1:47:17.140 --> 1:47:18.540\n by calling them a witch.\n\n1:47:18.540 --> 1:47:23.140\n Likewise, it's a fool's errand to try to rebut\n\n1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:26.220\n the contrary forces in American politics\n\n1:47:26.220 --> 1:47:29.340\n that are a reaction often to real things\n\n1:47:29.340 --> 1:47:31.500\n that are going on on the ground in black communities\n\n1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:33.420\n in the cities across this country\n\n1:47:33.420 --> 1:47:35.380\n by calling people a racist.\n\n1:47:35.380 --> 1:47:39.180\n You may shut them up, but you won't change their minds.\n\n1:47:39.180 --> 1:47:40.020\n And you know what?\n\n1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:41.740\n At the end of the day, they're gonna go to the ballot box\n\n1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:43.060\n and they're gonna vote.\n\n1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:45.420\n They're gonna pick up their store\n\n1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:47.580\n and they're gonna move it to the other side of town\n\n1:47:47.580 --> 1:47:49.700\n or to another town altogether.\n\n1:47:49.700 --> 1:47:51.940\n They're gonna keep their children away\n\n1:47:51.940 --> 1:47:53.820\n from places where they think the influences\n\n1:47:53.820 --> 1:47:55.940\n are harmful to those children.\n\n1:47:55.940 --> 1:47:58.580\n They may not even talk about it in public.\n\n1:47:58.580 --> 1:48:00.100\n You can believe that in private\n\n1:48:00.100 --> 1:48:02.460\n that they're talking about it with each other.\n\n1:48:02.460 --> 1:48:05.340\n You had better find a more effective way\n\n1:48:05.340 --> 1:48:07.540\n of dealing with the conflicts in this country\n\n1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:09.780\n that fall along racial fault lines\n\n1:48:09.780 --> 1:48:11.620\n than calling people witches,\n\n1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:15.940\n which is what this, you know, anti racist,\n\n1:48:15.940 --> 1:48:17.340\n you're a racist because you think\n\n1:48:17.340 --> 1:48:20.220\n that the out of wedlock birth rate amongst black Americans\n\n1:48:20.220 --> 1:48:21.900\n is seven babies out of 10 are born\n\n1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:23.620\n to a woman without a husband.\n\n1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:25.180\n Their families are falling apart.\n\n1:48:25.180 --> 1:48:26.380\n Now, no one says that in public\n\n1:48:26.380 --> 1:48:27.740\n because they'd be called a racist\n\n1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:29.020\n if they said it in public.\n\n1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:32.380\n But as a matter of fact, the families are falling apart.\n\n1:48:32.380 --> 1:48:33.820\n You didn't change that in the least\n\n1:48:33.820 --> 1:48:35.900\n by telling people to shut up about it.\n\n1:48:35.900 --> 1:48:38.220\n Daniel Patrick Moynihan is called a racist\n\n1:48:38.220 --> 1:48:40.660\n in the 1960s, the late Senator,\n\n1:48:40.660 --> 1:48:43.900\n the New York Senator who was a federal employee\n\n1:48:43.900 --> 1:48:45.580\n and an intellectual writing reports\n\n1:48:45.580 --> 1:48:47.500\n and he writes a report about the Negro family,\n\n1:48:47.500 --> 1:48:48.980\n he called it in those years.\n\n1:48:48.980 --> 1:48:50.100\n If I use the word Negro,\n\n1:48:50.100 --> 1:48:52.220\n now they're gonna call me a racist if I'm a white person.\n\n1:48:52.220 --> 1:48:54.180\n I can't even use the word Negro,\n\n1:48:54.180 --> 1:48:57.580\n which is a historically legitimate reference\n\n1:48:57.580 --> 1:49:01.740\n to the descendants of the enslaved people,\n\n1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:05.460\n which we were as black Americans proud to use until yesterday.\n\n1:49:06.580 --> 1:49:11.580\n So all of this linguistic policing is a sign of weakness.\n\n1:49:12.060 --> 1:49:15.500\n It's false black power.\n\n1:49:15.500 --> 1:49:17.140\n People will seed you the ground.\n\n1:49:17.140 --> 1:49:18.380\n Okay, you don't want me to use that word?\n\n1:49:18.380 --> 1:49:19.380\n I won't use that word anymore.\n\n1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:21.260\n Okay, you don't want me to talk about that in public?\n\n1:49:21.260 --> 1:49:23.580\n All right, I won't talk about it in public anymore.\n\n1:49:23.580 --> 1:49:25.020\n I don't wanna be called a racist, okay?\n\n1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:26.780\n So I won't express my opinion.\n\n1:49:26.780 --> 1:49:28.580\n You haven't changed anybody's mind.\n\n1:49:31.100 --> 1:49:34.460\n And you've also mentioned that for that,\n\n1:49:34.460 --> 1:49:35.940\n you haven't changed anybody's mind,\n\n1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:40.180\n but also for things like in universities and institutions,\n\n1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:42.900\n there's a diversity inclusion\n\n1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:46.660\n and equity kind of meetings and education and so on.\n\n1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:48.460\n And I believe I read somewhere,\n\n1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:50.940\n I've been, like I mentioned to you offline,\n\n1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:55.020\n big fan of your Glenn show, people should listen to it.\n\n1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:56.820\n It's amazing.\n\n1:49:56.820 --> 1:49:59.620\n There's also just interviews of you that I've listened to.\n\n1:49:59.620 --> 1:50:00.660\n I believe you mentioned somewhere\n\n1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:02.580\n that even those kinds of meetings,\n\n1:50:02.580 --> 1:50:05.780\n people might sit through and nod along,\n\n1:50:05.780 --> 1:50:09.620\n but that doesn't necessarily mean that's making progress,\n\n1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:14.620\n that they may actually be bottling up a frustration.\n\n1:50:15.460 --> 1:50:17.540\n The fear is that that's going to result\n\n1:50:17.540 --> 1:50:22.540\n in a pendulum sort of push back towards this idea\n\n1:50:22.540 --> 1:50:27.540\n of forced appreciations, like forced anti racism kind of thing.\n\n1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:32.780\n I talk about this often in my podcast,\n\n1:50:32.780 --> 1:50:36.100\n that's the Glenn show, you can find the Glenn show\n\n1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:38.820\n on my YouTube channel and also at Substack.\n\n1:50:39.860 --> 1:50:41.540\n Yeah, you have a great Substack.\n\n1:50:41.540 --> 1:50:43.660\n You and your friend do Q and As\n\n1:50:43.660 --> 1:50:45.700\n and all that kind of stuff on Patreon.\n\n1:50:45.700 --> 1:50:46.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:46.540 --> 1:50:48.300\n So yeah, so people should definitely follow you.\n\n1:50:48.300 --> 1:50:49.540\n It's a brilliant conversation.\n\n1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:50.380\n Check us out.\n\n1:50:50.380 --> 1:50:55.380\n But yeah, I mean, one concern is that the policing,\n\n1:50:56.780 --> 1:50:58.340\n the superficial policing,\n\n1:50:58.340 --> 1:51:00.140\n this is a part of political correctness,\n\n1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:02.260\n the insistence that you only use certain words,\n\n1:51:02.260 --> 1:51:03.940\n that you only talk in a certain way,\n\n1:51:03.940 --> 1:51:06.460\n is a phony kind of power\n\n1:51:06.460 --> 1:51:08.220\n because it doesn't actually persuade people\n\n1:51:08.220 --> 1:51:10.300\n about the issues that are at hand.\n\n1:51:10.300 --> 1:51:12.900\n Instead, it forces them underground\n\n1:51:12.900 --> 1:51:15.020\n in their talk about these issues,\n\n1:51:15.020 --> 1:51:18.740\n and that's problematic.\n\n1:51:18.740 --> 1:51:22.980\n Much better that we have overt and explicit\n\n1:51:22.980 --> 1:51:25.420\n and honest disagreement\n\n1:51:25.420 --> 1:51:27.820\n to the extent that there are disagreement\n\n1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:29.700\n about things that are going on\n\n1:51:29.700 --> 1:51:34.220\n than that we have a superficial kind of conversation\n\n1:51:37.900 --> 1:51:42.540\n that is purged of any real biting,\n\n1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:48.220\n discomforting confrontation with the realities\n\n1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:49.500\n of the situation at hand.\n\n1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:50.540\n And for black Americans,\n\n1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:52.340\n I think one big part of the reality\n\n1:51:52.340 --> 1:51:57.340\n of the situation at hand is violent crime, violent crime.\n\n1:51:57.980 --> 1:52:00.780\n A police officer is afraid when he stops the car\n\n1:52:00.780 --> 1:52:03.780\n because it's an 18 year old driver in the vehicle.\n\n1:52:03.780 --> 1:52:05.100\n He's got dreadlocks.\n\n1:52:05.100 --> 1:52:06.380\n He's a black person.\n\n1:52:06.380 --> 1:52:08.900\n The car doesn't have the right license plate.\n\n1:52:08.900 --> 1:52:11.900\n He's afraid to deal with that person.\n\n1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:13.500\n And one of the reasons he's afraid to deal with them\n\n1:52:13.500 --> 1:52:17.860\n is because a few who look like him are behaving violently.\n\n1:52:17.860 --> 1:52:20.020\n Their violence is usually perpetrated\n\n1:52:20.020 --> 1:52:23.540\n against others who look like themselves, but not always.\n\n1:52:23.540 --> 1:52:27.460\n And that reality doesn't get changed\n\n1:52:27.460 --> 1:52:32.460\n by telling a newspaper writer who writes about it\n\n1:52:32.540 --> 1:52:36.340\n that they are racist or enforcing within a newsroom.\n\n1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:38.380\n You can't cover that story in that way\n\n1:52:38.380 --> 1:52:41.460\n because to do so would be racist.\n\n1:52:41.460 --> 1:52:45.820\n I think it's a monumental mistake\n\n1:52:45.820 --> 1:52:50.820\n to enforce a closure on public discussion\n\n1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:55.940\n based upon a calculation that if we allow people,\n\n1:52:55.940 --> 1:52:58.780\n if Twitter allows this kind of post,\n\n1:52:58.780 --> 1:53:03.740\n if the Washington Post runs this kind of story, et cetera,\n\n1:53:03.740 --> 1:53:08.740\n you end up with a superficial politeness,\n\n1:53:08.740 --> 1:53:12.700\n a superficial politeness,\n\n1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:17.420\n but a subterranean seething resentment\n\n1:53:17.420 --> 1:53:19.600\n that only makes matters worse.\n\n1:53:21.220 --> 1:53:24.500\n If I can get your comment, maybe you have ideas\n\n1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:28.500\n because it does seem that this kind of attack works\n\n1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:33.500\n of being called a racist, being called, maybe not sexist,\n\n1:53:38.980 --> 1:53:42.860\n but somebody, like we're going through a Johnny Depp trial\n\n1:53:42.860 --> 1:53:44.260\n now, right?\n\n1:53:44.260 --> 1:53:47.420\n It's a defamation trial, and the reason it's a defamation\n\n1:53:47.420 --> 1:53:50.740\n trial is because all it took is a single accusation\n\n1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:54.340\n of Johnny Depp being somebody who sexually\n\n1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:56.660\n and physically abused Amber Heard.\n\n1:53:56.660 --> 1:53:59.500\n And all it took is just a single article.\n\n1:53:59.500 --> 1:54:04.500\n No proof was given except the accusation itself,\n\n1:54:04.780 --> 1:54:06.780\n and the world believed it.\n\n1:54:06.780 --> 1:54:09.580\n So it's effective.\n\n1:54:09.580 --> 1:54:13.180\n So how do you fight back if it's so damn effective\n\n1:54:13.180 --> 1:54:15.380\n that you can just call anybody racist?\n\n1:54:15.380 --> 1:54:16.980\n And it works.\n\n1:54:16.980 --> 1:54:18.300\n It's hard to wash off.\n\n1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:25.300\n It's, you're not proven in the court of law\n\n1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:32.060\n or anything like that, but we get those articles,\n\n1:54:32.060 --> 1:54:35.020\n we get that label, and then the world moves on\n\n1:54:35.020 --> 1:54:37.340\n and just assumes that person is racist.\n\n1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:41.060\n So how do you, do you have any ideas how to fight back?\n\n1:54:41.060 --> 1:54:42.300\n No, I don't, frankly.\n\n1:54:43.820 --> 1:54:44.660\n Just highlighting the fact.\n\n1:54:44.660 --> 1:54:46.780\n Listen, Roseanne Barr, who made this statement\n\n1:54:46.780 --> 1:54:49.500\n about Valerie Jarrett, she made some kind of ape\n\n1:54:49.500 --> 1:54:51.660\n like reference to the whatever, and her show\n\n1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.780\n got canceled, and she's a racist.\n\n1:54:54.780 --> 1:54:56.940\n So first of all, pointing it out, I suppose,\n\n1:54:56.940 --> 1:54:59.460\n is one of the most powerful things that this,\n\n1:54:59.460 --> 1:55:02.980\n the hypocrisy of it, the.\n\n1:55:04.220 --> 1:55:06.780\n You say it works, I guess you're right.\n\n1:55:06.780 --> 1:55:09.980\n It used to be that calling someone a communist worked.\n\n1:55:09.980 --> 1:55:13.900\n I mean, going back to the late 40s, early 50s,\n\n1:55:13.900 --> 1:55:18.060\n Red Scare, McCarthyism, and whatnot,\n\n1:55:18.060 --> 1:55:21.900\n and the person might've belonged to a club\n\n1:55:21.900 --> 1:55:24.780\n that was pro Soviet Union in the 1930s\n\n1:55:24.780 --> 1:55:25.940\n when they were in college.\n\n1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:28.180\n They might've voted for the socialist candidate,\n\n1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:31.980\n Henry Wallace, in the presidential election of 1948.\n\n1:55:31.980 --> 1:55:33.940\n They might belong to the Communist Party.\n\n1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:37.300\n They might think Karl Marx was right about a whole lot\n\n1:55:37.300 --> 1:55:39.580\n of stuff about capitalism and whatnot,\n\n1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:42.380\n and they got called a communist or a Marxist,\n\n1:55:42.380 --> 1:55:43.940\n and it could've ruined their career,\n\n1:55:43.940 --> 1:55:45.380\n could've ruined their lives.\n\n1:55:47.580 --> 1:55:49.620\n And a lot of people shut up about it,\n\n1:55:49.620 --> 1:55:51.940\n and it took, and it went on for a long time.\n\n1:55:53.220 --> 1:55:56.900\n And in a way, it kind of still is going on.\n\n1:55:56.900 --> 1:55:58.700\n I mean, you call somebody a Marxist,\n\n1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:01.340\n if you can make that stick, they're certainly not gonna\n\n1:56:01.340 --> 1:56:03.580\n get elected president of the United States.\n\n1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:06.300\n But I don't know about this.\n\n1:56:07.180 --> 1:56:10.700\n I think, you know, I once read this book\n\n1:56:10.700 --> 1:56:13.780\n by a German political scientist\n\n1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:16.780\n called Elisabeth Neula Neumann.\n\n1:56:16.780 --> 1:56:21.780\n That was the writer's name, Elisabeth Neula Neumann.\n\n1:56:21.940 --> 1:56:24.540\n The book was called The Spiral of Silence.\n\n1:56:25.900 --> 1:56:30.020\n And the argument was there can be some views,\n\n1:56:30.020 --> 1:56:34.100\n some issues in society that get defined\n\n1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:37.300\n in such a way that it's inappropriate to hold those views.\n\n1:56:37.300 --> 1:56:39.900\n And as a result, people who don't want to be shamed,\n\n1:56:39.900 --> 1:56:44.900\n who don't want to be ostracized don't express those views.\n\n1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:46.460\n And when they don't express them,\n\n1:56:46.460 --> 1:56:48.980\n anybody holding the view because they don't hear it\n\n1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:50.860\n said by others think that they're the only one\n\n1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:53.220\n and one of the few who hold the view,\n\n1:56:53.220 --> 1:56:55.300\n and so they don't want to be the only one\n\n1:56:55.300 --> 1:56:58.140\n out there saying something, so they keep it to themselves.\n\n1:56:58.140 --> 1:57:02.780\n So now this view, this attitude in society\n\n1:57:02.780 --> 1:57:05.540\n could be held by a large number of people,\n\n1:57:05.540 --> 1:57:10.540\n but because of the fear that if they were to express it,\n\n1:57:12.420 --> 1:57:15.020\n they'd be ostracized, no one says it.\n\n1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:16.820\n And since no one is saying it,\n\n1:57:16.820 --> 1:57:18.980\n the others who hold the view don't know\n\n1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:20.220\n that they're not alone,\n\n1:57:21.140 --> 1:57:24.420\n that they are not the only ones who hold the view.\n\n1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:25.700\n And hence they keep silent.\n\n1:57:25.700 --> 1:57:26.740\n That could be an equilibrium.\n\n1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:29.540\n It could be a relatively stable situation\n\n1:57:29.540 --> 1:57:32.020\n in which the emperor has no clothes.\n\n1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:36.660\n Everybody can see that this dude is naked, okay?\n\n1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:39.220\n But everybody thinks that, you know,\n\n1:57:39.220 --> 1:57:41.100\n I don't want to be the only one to say it.\n\n1:57:41.100 --> 1:57:44.740\n And so we all kind of collaborate in this charade\n\n1:57:45.620 --> 1:57:47.340\n of keeping the view to ourselves.\n\n1:57:48.580 --> 1:57:53.580\n Then along comes an event that somebody decides\n\n1:57:54.700 --> 1:57:59.700\n to defy the consensus and to speak out.\n\n1:57:59.700 --> 1:58:01.980\n It could be a little kid who in the story\n\n1:58:01.980 --> 1:58:03.180\n about the emperor has no clothes,\n\n1:58:03.180 --> 1:58:05.860\n doesn't realize that he's not supposed to say\n\n1:58:05.860 --> 1:58:07.860\n that the emperor is naked.\n\n1:58:07.860 --> 1:58:09.900\n The thing about the kid in the story\n\n1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:11.220\n who says that the emperor is naked,\n\n1:58:11.220 --> 1:58:12.740\n it's not that he's saying it.\n\n1:58:14.180 --> 1:58:17.420\n It's not even that other people hear him saying it.\n\n1:58:17.420 --> 1:58:19.100\n It's that everybody knows\n\n1:58:19.100 --> 1:58:22.940\n that everybody else heard him say it, okay?\n\n1:58:22.940 --> 1:58:27.020\n The kid who speaks out and says the emperor has no clothes\n\n1:58:27.020 --> 1:58:30.020\n creates a circumstance in which it's common knowledge\n\n1:58:30.020 --> 1:58:31.260\n that the emperor has no clothes.\n\n1:58:31.260 --> 1:58:33.940\n Now common knowledge does not just mean knowledge.\n\n1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:36.420\n It does not even mean widespread knowledge.\n\n1:58:36.420 --> 1:58:38.420\n It means comprehensive knowledge\n\n1:58:38.420 --> 1:58:42.460\n of other person's knowledge of the thing, okay?\n\n1:58:42.460 --> 1:58:45.940\n So the spiral of silence is a equilibrium\n\n1:58:45.940 --> 1:58:48.660\n that is susceptible to being undermined\n\n1:58:49.740 --> 1:58:53.740\n by a process of a kind of cumulative process,\n\n1:58:53.740 --> 1:58:56.220\n a snowballing process of revelation\n\n1:58:56.220 --> 1:59:00.220\n that you're not the only one who thinks this way, okay?\n\n1:59:00.220 --> 1:59:02.220\n It's fascinating to think that there's an ocean\n\n1:59:02.220 --> 1:59:05.540\n of common knowledge that we're waiting for the little kid\n\n1:59:05.540 --> 1:59:08.940\n to wake us up to, different little parts of it.\n\n1:59:08.940 --> 1:59:09.780\n That's correct.\n\n1:59:09.780 --> 1:59:10.700\n And the little kid, by the way,\n\n1:59:10.700 --> 1:59:12.540\n could be somebody like Donald Trump,\n\n1:59:12.540 --> 1:59:15.180\n only more effective than Donald Trump,\n\n1:59:15.180 --> 1:59:17.260\n somebody who is smarter than Donald Trump,\n\n1:59:17.260 --> 1:59:20.900\n somebody who is shrewder than Donald Trump,\n\n1:59:20.900 --> 1:59:25.620\n somebody who figures out that when Colin Kaepernick\n\n1:59:25.620 --> 1:59:29.100\n takes a knee at a football game and says,\n\n1:59:29.100 --> 1:59:31.340\n I'm not gonna stand for this president allegiance,\n\n1:59:31.340 --> 1:59:36.340\n that a vast number of people are very unhappy about that.\n\n1:59:38.820 --> 1:59:39.780\n Somebody who understands\n\n1:59:39.780 --> 1:59:43.180\n that when a Black Lives Matter activist\n\n1:59:43.180 --> 1:59:44.980\n stands up with his ball of fists and says,\n\n1:59:44.980 --> 1:59:47.380\n burn this bitch down about a city\n\n1:59:47.380 --> 1:59:49.660\n in the United States of America,\n\n1:59:49.660 --> 1:59:52.540\n that a lot of people are upset about that, a lot of them.\n\n1:59:52.540 --> 1:59:54.820\n A person, a shrewd politician,\n\n1:59:54.820 --> 1:59:58.700\n a shrewd manager of a public image\n\n1:59:59.740 --> 2:00:02.860\n could build on and create a circumstance\n\n2:00:02.860 --> 2:00:05.580\n in which more and more people will feel safe\n\n2:00:06.940 --> 2:00:07.900\n to express that view.\n\n2:00:07.900 --> 2:00:09.060\n And the more who express it,\n\n2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:12.420\n the safer those who have yet to express it but who hold it\n\n2:00:12.420 --> 2:00:13.940\n will feel in expressing it.\n\n2:00:13.940 --> 2:00:17.060\n And to the extent that the view is very widespread\n\n2:00:17.060 --> 2:00:21.020\n but is kept under wraps, an explosion could happen.\n\n2:00:21.020 --> 2:00:23.060\n And you can look up tomorrow and have a very different\n\n2:00:23.060 --> 2:00:25.460\n country than you had today\n\n2:00:25.460 --> 2:00:30.460\n because the conspiracy of silence, the spiral of silence\n\n2:00:30.740 --> 2:00:34.860\n ends up getting unraveled by somebody who steps out\n\n2:00:34.860 --> 2:00:36.100\n away from the consensus,\n\n2:00:36.100 --> 2:00:38.340\n dares to take the slings and arrows\n\n2:00:38.340 --> 2:00:40.900\n of exposing themselves as a naysayer\n\n2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:44.980\n but taps into a sentiment that's very widespread.\n\n2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:49.700\n And I fear that with respect to many racial issues,\n\n2:00:49.700 --> 2:00:53.940\n this is the situation that we actually confront,\n\n2:00:53.940 --> 2:00:57.220\n that it could unravel in a very ugly way.\n\n2:00:57.220 --> 2:01:00.100\n But it could also unravel in a beautiful way.\n\n2:01:00.100 --> 2:01:02.260\n So it's depending.\n\n2:01:02.260 --> 2:01:04.300\n There is a spiral of silence, you're saying,\n\n2:01:04.300 --> 2:01:07.820\n and it could be, speaking of children,\n\n2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:11.940\n charismatic children, there's a guy named Elon Musk\n\n2:01:11.940 --> 2:01:16.860\n who might be a candidate for such an unraveling, right?\n\n2:01:16.860 --> 2:01:20.060\n You mentioned the person that speaks out\n\n2:01:20.060 --> 2:01:21.140\n could be a Donald Trump.\n\n2:01:21.140 --> 2:01:23.900\n But in this current situation that we live in,\n\n2:01:23.900 --> 2:01:28.260\n like as this week, Elon has purchased Twitter.\n\n2:01:28.260 --> 2:01:29.420\n That's what I hear.\n\n2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:34.300\n And is pushing for, in all kinds of ways,\n\n2:01:34.300 --> 2:01:37.460\n the increase of free speech on Twitter.\n\n2:01:37.460 --> 2:01:40.460\n And speaking about some of the issues\n\n2:01:40.460 --> 2:01:44.500\n that we've been speaking about here with you,\n\n2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:47.940\n but maybe in broader strokes about just the fact\n\n2:01:47.940 --> 2:01:50.660\n that you have to, it's okay to point out\n\n2:01:50.660 --> 2:01:52.900\n that the emperor wears no clothes,\n\n2:01:52.900 --> 2:01:55.940\n and to do so from all sides in a way\n\n2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:57.740\n that everybody's a little bit pissed off,\n\n2:01:57.740 --> 2:01:58.860\n but not too much.\n\n2:01:59.820 --> 2:02:01.540\n What do you think about this whole effort\n\n2:02:01.540 --> 2:02:06.020\n of free speech in these public platforms?\n\n2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:10.280\n Elon in particular, Twitter, your avid Twitter user.\n\n2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:14.340\n But just public platforms for discourse,\n\n2:02:14.340 --> 2:02:18.860\n for us as a civilization to figure stuff out.\n\n2:02:18.860 --> 2:02:21.780\n Yeah, well, the people on the left\n\n2:02:21.780 --> 2:02:23.620\n are very upset about the possibility\n\n2:02:23.620 --> 2:02:28.140\n that Elon Musk and Twitter will be open to,\n\n2:02:28.140 --> 2:02:33.140\n more open to provocative public speech\n\n2:02:33.180 --> 2:02:37.340\n that has heretofore been banned or suppressed.\n\n2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:41.520\n And I think they might be right to be concerned\n\n2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:43.000\n that that could happen.\n\n2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.300\n I don't know enough about the technology\n\n2:02:45.300 --> 2:02:47.740\n and about the market to really,\n\n2:02:47.740 --> 2:02:50.460\n I mean, social media and whatnot,\n\n2:02:50.460 --> 2:02:53.720\n it seems like it's a complicated system\n\n2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:56.380\n of interactions between people and who the users are\n\n2:02:56.380 --> 2:02:57.560\n and so forth and so on.\n\n2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:02.500\n I do know that that New York Post story\n\n2:03:02.500 --> 2:03:06.340\n about Hunter Biden's laptop was real news\n\n2:03:06.340 --> 2:03:08.940\n and could have affected the outcome of the election,\n\n2:03:08.940 --> 2:03:10.540\n and it was suppressed,\n\n2:03:10.540 --> 2:03:14.380\n and that Twitter had a role in suppressing it.\n\n2:03:14.380 --> 2:03:18.560\n I do know that the question of where the COVID 19 virus\n\n2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:22.300\n originated and the role that a lab leak account\n\n2:03:22.300 --> 2:03:26.280\n could have played in the public processing of that event\n\n2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:29.360\n was real news, and that it was suppressed\n\n2:03:29.360 --> 2:03:32.500\n by people who were trying to control misinformation,\n\n2:03:32.500 --> 2:03:36.140\n disinformation, Russian disinformation campaigns\n\n2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:36.980\n and whatnot.\n\n2:03:36.980 --> 2:03:40.780\n So Twitter has users, I'm one of them,\n\n2:03:40.780 --> 2:03:42.120\n and it has a lot of users.\n\n2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:43.820\n It's not as big as Facebook, I gather.\n\n2:03:43.820 --> 2:03:46.780\n It's not, but it's important,\n\n2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:51.780\n the ability to construct counter platforms,\n\n2:03:51.940 --> 2:03:53.660\n people moving around and whatnot.\n\n2:03:54.900 --> 2:03:56.460\n It's a kind of network dynamic\n\n2:03:56.460 --> 2:03:58.500\n that maybe I should understand it better than I do\n\n2:03:58.500 --> 2:04:00.260\n being a social scientist, but.\n\n2:04:00.260 --> 2:04:01.860\n I don't think anyone understands it,\n\n2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:05.460\n even people inside Twitter, which is fascinating.\n\n2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:09.420\n It's a monster because of just the bandwidth of messaging,\n\n2:04:09.420 --> 2:04:12.660\n and you don't know who is a bot and who is a human.\n\n2:04:12.660 --> 2:04:14.340\n That's a fascinating dynamic,\n\n2:04:15.580 --> 2:04:19.120\n and the viral nature of negativity.\n\n2:04:20.940 --> 2:04:22.780\n All of those dynamics, of course,\n\n2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:25.700\n you are probably the right person to understand it\n\n2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.100\n from a social scientist perspective,\n\n2:04:28.100 --> 2:04:29.980\n from an economics perspective,\n\n2:04:29.980 --> 2:04:31.860\n but nobody really understands,\n\n2:04:31.860 --> 2:04:34.780\n and it's fascinating within that domain,\n\n2:04:34.780 --> 2:04:38.900\n how do you allow for free speech,\n\n2:04:38.900 --> 2:04:41.520\n not allow for free speech, encourage free speech,\n\n2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.300\n defend free speech, and at the same time,\n\n2:04:45.300 --> 2:04:49.260\n manage millions of ongoing conversations\n\n2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:54.260\n from just becoming insanely chaotic.\n\n2:04:56.340 --> 2:04:58.680\n Sort of from Twitter perspective,\n\n2:04:58.680 --> 2:05:02.020\n they want people to be happy, to grow,\n\n2:05:02.020 --> 2:05:05.380\n to actually have difficult, critical conversations,\n\n2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:08.240\n and the problem with humans is they think\n\n2:05:08.240 --> 2:05:12.260\n they know what that is, and they think\n\n2:05:12.260 --> 2:05:14.300\n they can label things as misinformation,\n\n2:05:14.300 --> 2:05:18.780\n as counterproductive or healthy conversations, in quotes,\n\n2:05:18.780 --> 2:05:22.100\n and the problem is, as we are learning,\n\n2:05:22.100 --> 2:05:25.280\n humans are not able to do that effectively.\n\n2:05:25.280 --> 2:05:27.780\n First of all, power corrupts.\n\n2:05:27.780 --> 2:05:30.900\n There's something delicious about having the power\n\n2:05:30.900 --> 2:05:33.180\n to label something as misinformation.\n\n2:05:33.180 --> 2:05:35.800\n You do that once for something\n\n2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:37.940\n that might be obviously misinformation,\n\n2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:39.780\n and then you start getting greedy.\n\n2:05:39.780 --> 2:05:40.940\n You start getting excited.\n\n2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:41.860\n It feels good.\n\n2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:43.980\n It feels good to label something\n\n2:05:43.980 --> 2:05:46.660\n as misinformation or disinformation\n\n2:05:46.660 --> 2:05:49.940\n that you just don't like, and over time,\n\n2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:52.460\n especially if there's a culture inside of a company\n\n2:05:52.460 --> 2:05:55.140\n that leans a certain political direction\n\n2:05:55.140 --> 2:05:57.540\n or leans, in all the groups that we talked about,\n\n2:05:57.540 --> 2:05:59.800\n leans a certain way, they'll start\n\n2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:03.580\n to label as misinformation things they just don't like,\n\n2:06:03.580 --> 2:06:07.540\n and that power is delicious, and it corrupts.\n\n2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:08.980\n You have to construct mechanisms,\n\n2:06:08.980 --> 2:06:10.580\n like the Founding Fathers did,\n\n2:06:10.580 --> 2:06:14.300\n for somehow preventing you from allowing\n\n2:06:14.300 --> 2:06:15.900\n that power to get too delicious.\n\n2:06:17.860 --> 2:06:19.660\n At least that's my perspective on what's going on.\n\n2:06:19.660 --> 2:06:21.260\n Well, I'll just tell you personally,\n\n2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:23.340\n I'm excited about the prospect.\n\n2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:25.860\n I'm glad to see Musk making the move that he's making,\n\n2:06:25.860 --> 2:06:29.100\n and we'll see what happens at Twitter and so forth.\n\n2:06:29.100 --> 2:06:33.180\n You're looking forward for the, what did he say?\n\n2:06:33.180 --> 2:06:35.140\n Let's make Twitter more fun.\n\n2:06:35.140 --> 2:06:38.180\n I'm looking forward to the fun.\n\n2:06:39.180 --> 2:06:43.220\n You've talked about you are at a prestigious university.\n\n2:06:43.220 --> 2:06:44.220\n Brown University.\n\n2:06:44.220 --> 2:06:48.060\n Brown University, and you've mentioned\n\n2:06:48.060 --> 2:06:50.220\n that universities might be in trouble.\n\n2:06:50.220 --> 2:06:52.420\n I think it's with Jordan, but everywhere else,\n\n2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:54.940\n that barbarians are at the gate.\n\n2:06:54.940 --> 2:06:59.700\n Who are the barbarians at the gate of the university?\n\n2:06:59.700 --> 2:07:03.500\n So first of all, what is to you beautiful\n\n2:07:03.500 --> 2:07:08.500\n about the ideal of the university in America, of academia?\n\n2:07:09.260 --> 2:07:12.100\n And what is a threat?\n\n2:07:12.100 --> 2:07:15.260\n Well, you know, a university is dedicated\n\n2:07:15.260 --> 2:07:20.260\n to the pursuit of truth, and to the education\n\n2:07:21.540 --> 2:07:24.460\n and nurturing of young people as they enter\n\n2:07:24.460 --> 2:07:29.460\n into the pursuit of truth, to doing research and to teaching\n\n2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:34.700\n in a environment of free inquiry and civil discourse.\n\n2:07:37.020 --> 2:07:40.860\n So free inquiry means you go wherever the evidence\n\n2:07:40.860 --> 2:07:43.540\n and your imagination may lead you.\n\n2:07:43.540 --> 2:07:46.500\n And civil discourse means that you exchange arguments\n\n2:07:46.500 --> 2:07:48.140\n with people when you don't agree with them\n\n2:07:48.140 --> 2:07:50.740\n on behalf of trying to get to the bottom of things.\n\n2:07:50.740 --> 2:07:55.220\n I think the university is a magnificent institution.\n\n2:07:55.220 --> 2:07:59.220\n It is a relatively modern institution.\n\n2:07:59.220 --> 2:08:01.580\n I mean, last 500 years or so.\n\n2:08:01.580 --> 2:08:03.500\n I mean, there are universities that are older than that,\n\n2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:07.260\n but the great research universities of the world,\n\n2:08:07.260 --> 2:08:09.820\n not only here in the United States,\n\n2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:14.340\n are places where human ingenuity is nurtured,\n\n2:08:14.340 --> 2:08:16.780\n where new lot knowledge is created,\n\n2:08:16.780 --> 2:08:21.780\n and where young people are equipped to answer questions\n\n2:08:21.780 --> 2:08:25.260\n that are open questions about our existence\n\n2:08:25.260 --> 2:08:26.940\n in the world that we live in.\n\n2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:30.020\n You can trace to the university much,\n\n2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:33.940\n if not most, of the advances in technology\n\n2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:35.780\n and resourcefulness and our understanding\n\n2:08:35.780 --> 2:08:38.740\n of the origins of the species, of the nature of the universe,\n\n2:08:38.740 --> 2:08:41.540\n cosmology, et cetera, science,\n\n2:08:41.540 --> 2:08:44.740\n the pursuit of humanistic understanding,\n\n2:08:44.740 --> 2:08:47.460\n the nurturing of traditions of inquiry,\n\n2:08:47.460 --> 2:08:49.740\n so forth, so that's the university.\n\n2:08:49.740 --> 2:08:51.140\n Barbarians are at the gates.\n\n2:08:52.260 --> 2:08:55.420\n The people who are trying to shut down open inquiry\n\n2:08:55.420 --> 2:08:58.460\n at the university on behalf of their particular view\n\n2:08:58.460 --> 2:09:03.460\n about things are a threat to what the university stands for,\n\n2:09:03.780 --> 2:09:05.740\n and they should be resisted.\n\n2:09:05.740 --> 2:09:10.740\n So if I'm inquiring about the nature of human intelligence,\n\n2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:13.740\n and I wanna study differences between human populations\n\n2:09:13.740 --> 2:09:15.580\n and their acquisition of,\n\n2:09:15.580 --> 2:09:19.540\n or their expression of cognitive ability,\n\n2:09:19.540 --> 2:09:22.180\n that's fair game, it's an open question.\n\n2:09:22.180 --> 2:09:24.780\n If I wanna know something about the nature\n\n2:09:24.780 --> 2:09:28.780\n of gender affiliation and identity\n\n2:09:28.780 --> 2:09:32.180\n and gender dysphoria and whatnot,\n\n2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:34.100\n that's fair game to study in a university.\n\n2:09:34.100 --> 2:09:37.580\n You can't shut that down, you shouldn't be able to,\n\n2:09:37.580 --> 2:09:41.740\n by saying, I have a particular position here,\n\n2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:43.540\n I'm a member of a particular identity group,\n\n2:09:43.540 --> 2:09:47.580\n suppose I wanna study the history of colonialism,\n\n2:09:47.580 --> 2:09:51.140\n and there's a narrative on the progressive side,\n\n2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:54.220\n which is colonialism is about Europeans dominating\n\n2:09:54.220 --> 2:09:55.620\n and stealing or whatever, whatever,\n\n2:09:55.620 --> 2:09:58.140\n and I happen to think, well, there's another aspect\n\n2:09:58.140 --> 2:09:59.660\n to the story about colonialism too,\n\n2:09:59.660 --> 2:10:02.740\n which is that it's a mechanism for the diffusion\n\n2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:05.340\n of the best in human civilization to populations\n\n2:10:05.340 --> 2:10:08.860\n that were significantly lagging behind with respect to that.\n\n2:10:08.860 --> 2:10:12.980\n It brought literacy to the Southern hemispheric populations\n\n2:10:12.980 --> 2:10:16.780\n that were dominated in the process of the colonizing thing.\n\n2:10:16.780 --> 2:10:17.940\n It's complicated.\n\n2:10:17.940 --> 2:10:19.980\n I'm not taking that position, by the way.\n\n2:10:19.980 --> 2:10:22.460\n I'm just saying somebody at a university\n\n2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:26.180\n should be able to take it up and pursue it\n\n2:10:26.180 --> 2:10:28.020\n and engage in argument with people about it.\n\n2:10:28.020 --> 2:10:29.540\n I'm talking about race and ethnicity,\n\n2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:32.340\n but this extends to a wide range of things.\n\n2:10:32.340 --> 2:10:33.660\n Suppose we're talking about race,\n\n2:10:33.660 --> 2:10:36.700\n a wide range of things, suppose we're talking about climate,\n\n2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:38.780\n and one person says the earth is endangered\n\n2:10:38.780 --> 2:10:42.580\n because carbon in global warming, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n2:10:42.580 --> 2:10:44.820\n and another person says, no, wait, no, wait,\n\n2:10:45.940 --> 2:10:48.180\n look at where we stand in the 21st century.\n\n2:10:48.180 --> 2:10:51.460\n We're vastly richer than our ancestors just 250 years ago.\n\n2:10:51.460 --> 2:10:53.260\n We have much more knowledge about that\n\n2:10:53.260 --> 2:10:54.100\n and so forth and so on.\n\n2:10:54.100 --> 2:10:59.100\n 250 years from now, human ingenuity will have devised\n\n2:10:59.300 --> 2:11:02.820\n in ways that we can not even begin to anticipate.\n\n2:11:02.820 --> 2:11:07.820\n All manner of technological means for managing the problem.\n\n2:11:09.060 --> 2:11:11.420\n There's no reason that we should shut down\n\n2:11:11.420 --> 2:11:14.340\n industrial civilization today\n\n2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:16.940\n because we fear the consequences of it\n\n2:11:16.940 --> 2:11:20.500\n when in fact we are vastly richer than our ancestors\n\n2:11:20.500 --> 2:11:22.340\n and those who come two centuries after us\n\n2:11:22.340 --> 2:11:24.820\n will be vastly more effective\n\n2:11:24.820 --> 2:11:27.260\n at dealing with problems than we are now.\n\n2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:28.620\n Let's, et cetera.\n\n2:11:28.620 --> 2:11:30.820\n I'm not actually making that argument.\n\n2:11:30.820 --> 2:11:35.340\n I'm just saying the tendency to try to say, oh, no,\n\n2:11:35.340 --> 2:11:36.940\n that person is a climate denier.\n\n2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:40.260\n They can't pursue that area of inquiry\n\n2:11:40.260 --> 2:11:44.420\n is against the spirit of the university.\n\n2:11:44.420 --> 2:11:47.100\n I think the barbarians at the gates\n\n2:11:47.100 --> 2:11:50.460\n has to do with the people who think they know\n\n2:11:50.460 --> 2:11:52.100\n what the right side of history is\n\n2:11:52.100 --> 2:11:54.180\n and try to make the university stand\n\n2:11:54.180 --> 2:11:55.580\n on the right side of history.\n\n2:11:56.540 --> 2:11:58.660\n My position is you don't know\n\n2:11:58.660 --> 2:12:01.180\n what the right side of history is.\n\n2:12:01.180 --> 2:12:03.740\n And the purpose of a university is to equip you\n\n2:12:03.740 --> 2:12:07.740\n to be able to think about what is the right side of history.\n\n2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:11.940\n What is the solution to the dilemmas that confront us\n\n2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:14.500\n as human beings living on this planet\n\n2:12:14.500 --> 2:12:17.780\n with the billions that we are in the condition that we are.\n\n2:12:18.820 --> 2:12:22.500\n So the identitarians,\n\n2:12:22.500 --> 2:12:25.820\n the ones who wanna make the university kowtow\n\n2:12:25.820 --> 2:12:30.460\n to their particular understandings about their own identity.\n\n2:12:31.500 --> 2:12:36.180\n We now have at Brown University and various other places,\n\n2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:38.380\n we don't do Columbus Day anymore.\n\n2:12:38.380 --> 2:12:40.660\n We do Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\n2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:42.980\n When that day comes up in October,\n\n2:12:42.980 --> 2:12:44.380\n we don't talk about Columbus.\n\n2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:46.020\n They're taking down statues of Columbus\n\n2:12:46.020 --> 2:12:48.700\n all across the country and so forth and so on.\n\n2:12:48.700 --> 2:12:50.980\n I'm not arguing anything here other than\n\n2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:55.980\n that the latter day position\n\n2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:03.540\n BIPOCs, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color,\n\n2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:05.820\n the latter day position that the university\n\n2:13:05.820 --> 2:13:09.460\n has to reflect a particular sensibility\n\n2:13:09.460 --> 2:13:11.980\n about these identity questions.\n\n2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.860\n I think it's a threat to the integrity of the enterprise.\n\n2:13:14.860 --> 2:13:16.580\n I don't think you're overstating it.\n\n2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:21.580\n I tend to be, just from my limited knowledge of MIT,\n\n2:13:22.540 --> 2:13:25.380\n but perhaps it applies broadly,\n\n2:13:25.380 --> 2:13:29.940\n I think the beauty of the university, broadly speaking,\n\n2:13:29.940 --> 2:13:31.980\n is the faculty and the students.\n\n2:13:33.540 --> 2:13:38.540\n And the problem arises from the overreach\n\n2:13:40.420 --> 2:13:43.980\n of a overgrowing administration\n\n2:13:43.980 --> 2:13:48.980\n that gives, again, thinks that it knows enough\n\n2:13:51.100 --> 2:13:56.100\n to make rules and conclusions based on a set of beliefs,\n\n2:13:56.340 --> 2:14:00.180\n and then based on that, empowers a certain small selection\n\n2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:04.860\n of students to be the sort of voices of activism,\n\n2:14:04.860 --> 2:14:07.100\n of a particular idea.\n\n2:14:07.100 --> 2:14:10.100\n And not, I think activism is beautiful,\n\n2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:12.820\n but not just activism, but anybody that disagrees\n\n2:14:12.820 --> 2:14:17.300\n is shut down, and that, I think,\n\n2:14:17.300 --> 2:14:20.460\n the blame lies with the administration.\n\n2:14:20.460 --> 2:14:23.220\n So I think the solution is in lessening,\n\n2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:25.660\n just like the solution with too big of a government,\n\n2:14:25.660 --> 2:14:28.460\n too big of a bureaucracy, is there needs to be\n\n2:14:30.100 --> 2:14:34.660\n redistribution of power to what makes universities beautiful,\n\n2:14:34.660 --> 2:14:38.820\n which is the old students and the young students,\n\n2:14:38.820 --> 2:14:42.220\n old students being professors.\n\n2:14:42.220 --> 2:14:45.900\n So the scholars, the curious minds,\n\n2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:48.140\n the people that are in this whole thing\n\n2:14:48.140 --> 2:14:51.180\n to explore the world, to be curious about it,\n\n2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:53.340\n on a salary that's probably way too low\n\n2:14:53.340 --> 2:14:54.700\n for the thing they're doing.\n\n2:14:54.700 --> 2:14:57.020\n That's the whole point.\n\n2:14:57.020 --> 2:15:01.100\n And then the administration just gets in the way,\n\n2:15:01.100 --> 2:15:05.780\n and is the source of this kind of,\n\n2:15:05.780 --> 2:15:08.980\n I would say that, in your beautiful phrasing,\n\n2:15:08.980 --> 2:15:10.460\n I would say the administration\n\n2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:12.180\n is the barbarians at the gate.\n\n2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:15.420\n So the solution is smaller bureaucracy,\n\n2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:16.860\n smaller administrations.\n\n2:15:16.860 --> 2:15:18.920\n I have to, on this point, you had this conversation,\n\n2:15:18.920 --> 2:15:23.160\n you put on your self stack with Jordan Peterson\n\n2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.380\n about cognitive inequality.\n\n2:15:25.380 --> 2:15:28.340\n I think it's titled Wrestling with Cognitive Inequality.\n\n2:15:29.540 --> 2:15:33.340\n This particular topic of just IQ differences\n\n2:15:33.340 --> 2:15:36.180\n between groups, why is this,\n\n2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:39.240\n why is it so dangerous to talk about?\n\n2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:42.880\n Why this particular topic?\n\n2:15:42.880 --> 2:15:45.080\n Well, it's like you're calling black people inferior.\n\n2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.920\n It's like you're saying they're genetically inferior.\n\n2:15:46.920 --> 2:15:48.560\n That's what people are saying.\n\n2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:51.840\n It's like you're rationalizing the disparity of outcomes\n\n2:15:51.840 --> 2:15:55.960\n by reference to the intrinsic inferiority of black people.\n\n2:15:55.960 --> 2:16:00.960\n If you say cognitive ability matters for social outcomes,\n\n2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.660\n if you say cognitive ability exists,\n\n2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:04.680\n people really are different\n\n2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:07.240\n in terms of their intellectual functioning.\n\n2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:09.920\n And if you say cognitive ability differences\n\n2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:14.920\n are substantial between racially defined populations,\n\n2:16:15.080 --> 2:16:17.200\n the sum of that, there is cognitive ability,\n\n2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:19.260\n it matters, and the difference by race\n\n2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:22.720\n is the conclusion that outcome differences by race\n\n2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.240\n are in part due to natural differences\n\n2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:28.000\n between the populations.\n\n2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:30.800\n People find that to be completely offensive\n\n2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:32.200\n and unacceptable.\n\n2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:34.040\n So that's what I think is going on.\n\n2:16:34.040 --> 2:16:37.240\n Can you steel me on that case\n\n2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:40.620\n that we should be careful doing that kind of research?\n\n2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:46.480\n So this has to do with research.\n\n2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:51.500\n It's like the Nazis used Nietzsche in their propaganda.\n\n2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:58.500\n You can use, white supremacists could use conclusions,\n\n2:16:58.500 --> 2:17:03.500\n cherry pick conclusions of studies to push their agenda.\n\n2:17:04.900 --> 2:17:07.060\n Can you steel me on the case that we should be careful?\n\n2:17:07.060 --> 2:17:08.540\n Yeah, I could do it at three levels.\n\n2:17:08.540 --> 2:17:11.500\n One is what do we mean by cognitive ability?\n\n2:17:11.500 --> 2:17:13.660\n So there's many different kinds of intelligence\n\n2:17:13.660 --> 2:17:15.380\n a person might say.\n\n2:17:15.380 --> 2:17:18.260\n How good are IQ tests at measuring\n\n2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:20.760\n other kinds of human capacities\n\n2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:24.220\n that are pertinent to success in life,\n\n2:17:24.220 --> 2:17:27.680\n like temperament, like emotional intelligence, and so on.\n\n2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:31.020\n So intelligence is not a one dimensional thing\n\n2:17:31.020 --> 2:17:32.700\n measured by G.\n\n2:17:32.700 --> 2:17:36.060\n The cognitive psychologists talk about G,\n\n2:17:36.060 --> 2:17:38.500\n the general intelligence factor,\n\n2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:41.460\n which is a statistical construction.\n\n2:17:41.460 --> 2:17:44.620\n It's a factor analytic resolution\n\n2:17:44.620 --> 2:17:48.340\n of the correlation across individuals\n\n2:17:48.340 --> 2:17:49.780\n in their performance on a battery,\n\n2:17:49.780 --> 2:17:50.780\n a different kind of test.\n\n2:17:50.780 --> 2:17:55.780\n And they use that to define a general factor of intelligence\n\n2:17:55.780 --> 2:17:59.900\n that a person could say that is a very narrow view\n\n2:17:59.900 --> 2:18:04.780\n of what human mental capacities actually are.\n\n2:18:04.780 --> 2:18:07.900\n And that it's much better to think about\n\n2:18:07.900 --> 2:18:12.540\n multi dimensional measures of human mental functioning\n\n2:18:12.540 --> 2:18:15.340\n rather than a single cognitive ability measure,\n\n2:18:15.340 --> 2:18:20.340\n so called IQ, which is a narrow construction\n\n2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:25.340\n that doesn't capture all of the subtle nuance\n\n2:18:26.340 --> 2:18:28.280\n of human difference in functioning.\n\n2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:30.560\n Functioning is not just the ability\n\n2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:34.800\n to recite backwards a sequence of numbers.\n\n2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:37.040\n I say eight, seven, nine, five, three, two.\n\n2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:40.040\n You say two, three, five, seven, eight, nine.\n\n2:18:40.040 --> 2:18:40.960\n It's not just that.\n\n2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:45.960\n Intelligence is a complex management\n\n2:18:47.360 --> 2:18:49.600\n of many different dimensions of human performance,\n\n2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:54.600\n including things like being able to stick with a task\n\n2:18:54.760 --> 2:18:58.840\n and not give up, things like being able to discipline\n\n2:18:58.840 --> 2:19:02.080\n and control your impulses so as to remain focused\n\n2:19:02.080 --> 2:19:03.560\n and so forth.\n\n2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:04.620\n That could be one dimension.\n\n2:19:04.620 --> 2:19:07.560\n I could start by questioning the very foundation\n\n2:19:07.560 --> 2:19:12.560\n of the argument for racial differences in cognitive ability\n\n2:19:13.220 --> 2:19:18.220\n by saying that your measure of cognitive ability is flawed.\n\n2:19:18.220 --> 2:19:19.700\n I could go to a higher level.\n\n2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:23.740\n I could say what we're really interested in\n\n2:19:23.740 --> 2:19:28.740\n is social outcomes and the question of what factors\n\n2:19:28.900 --> 2:19:32.420\n influence social outcomes extends well beyond mental ability\n\n2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:33.860\n to many other things.\n\n2:19:33.860 --> 2:19:35.300\n So here's an example.\n\n2:19:37.940 --> 2:19:41.900\n Visual acuity, how well do you see?\n\n2:19:41.900 --> 2:19:43.820\n You're not wearing glasses, I am.\n\n2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:48.820\n Visual acuity varies between human beings.\n\n2:19:48.940 --> 2:19:52.180\n Some people see better than other people do.\n\n2:19:52.180 --> 2:19:54.660\n Visual acuity can be measured.\n\n2:19:54.660 --> 2:19:57.020\n I can put you at the chart and you can,\n\n2:19:57.020 --> 2:19:58.780\n can you identify and read that bottom line\n\n2:19:58.780 --> 2:20:00.260\n in small print or not?\n\n2:20:00.260 --> 2:20:02.060\n So we can measure visual acuity\n\n2:20:02.060 --> 2:20:04.020\n and it varies between human beings.\n\n2:20:04.020 --> 2:20:07.500\n Visual acuity is partly genetic.\n\n2:20:07.500 --> 2:20:09.860\n I think that's undoubtedly true.\n\n2:20:09.860 --> 2:20:12.220\n We inherit genes that influence whether or not\n\n2:20:12.220 --> 2:20:15.900\n we are nearsighted or farsighted or astigmatic or whatever.\n\n2:20:15.900 --> 2:20:19.660\n So visual acuity differs between people\n\n2:20:19.660 --> 2:20:23.740\n and can be measured and is under genetic control.\n\n2:20:23.740 --> 2:20:28.060\n On the other hand, corrective lenses allow for us\n\n2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:29.740\n to level the playing field between people\n\n2:20:29.740 --> 2:20:34.140\n who are differently endowed in terms of visual acuity.\n\n2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:37.500\n Likewise, social outcomes are what we're really interested in\n\n2:20:37.500 --> 2:20:41.620\n employment, earnings, whether or not they're law abiding,\n\n2:20:41.620 --> 2:20:43.580\n how do they conduct themselves and their families\n\n2:20:43.580 --> 2:20:45.700\n and so forth amongst individuals.\n\n2:20:45.700 --> 2:20:47.940\n Yes, social outcomes are influenced\n\n2:20:47.940 --> 2:20:49.620\n by so called cognitive ability,\n\n2:20:49.620 --> 2:20:52.340\n but they're influenced by many other things as well.\n\n2:20:52.340 --> 2:20:56.660\n If there are interventions that can be undertaken in society\n\n2:20:56.660 --> 2:20:58.900\n that level the playing field between people\n\n2:20:58.900 --> 2:21:02.020\n who have different natural endowments of cognitive ability,\n\n2:21:02.020 --> 2:21:05.860\n the fact that people or groups differ in cognitive ability\n\n2:21:05.860 --> 2:21:07.540\n becomes less significant.\n\n2:21:07.540 --> 2:21:10.140\n Just like it's less significant that people differ\n\n2:21:10.140 --> 2:21:12.180\n with respect to how well they see\n\n2:21:12.180 --> 2:21:14.420\n when corrective lenses allow\n\n2:21:14.420 --> 2:21:16.940\n for the leveling of that playing field.\n\n2:21:16.940 --> 2:21:20.740\n There are in fact interventions, educational interventions,\n\n2:21:20.740 --> 2:21:23.740\n early childhood interventions that have been shown\n\n2:21:23.740 --> 2:21:25.260\n to level the playing field\n\n2:21:25.260 --> 2:21:27.220\n to create better life outcomes for people\n\n2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:30.980\n even if they happen to be endowed with low intelligence.\n\n2:21:30.980 --> 2:21:35.340\n So a second level of arguing against this whole program\n\n2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:38.220\n of research on human differences and intelligence\n\n2:21:38.220 --> 2:21:40.340\n is to observe that yes, human beings\n\n2:21:40.340 --> 2:21:42.700\n and perhaps racially defined groups\n\n2:21:42.700 --> 2:21:46.580\n may differ on the average in intellectual endowment,\n\n2:21:46.580 --> 2:21:49.100\n but there well may be social interventions\n\n2:21:49.100 --> 2:21:50.620\n that level the playing field,\n\n2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:51.980\n whether it's in education\n\n2:21:51.980 --> 2:21:55.180\n or in other kinds of programmatic interventions,\n\n2:21:55.180 --> 2:21:57.300\n especially for the poor.\n\n2:21:57.300 --> 2:21:59.900\n A final level of argument is the one that you alluded to,\n\n2:21:59.900 --> 2:22:02.100\n which is that if you talk like this,\n\n2:22:02.100 --> 2:22:04.260\n you're gonna encourage a kind of politics\n\n2:22:04.260 --> 2:22:05.940\n which is very ugly.\n\n2:22:05.940 --> 2:22:09.740\n And it's best to frame the discussion\n\n2:22:09.740 --> 2:22:11.700\n in ways that don't put emphasis\n\n2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:16.700\n on racially defined natural differences between populations.\n\n2:22:17.580 --> 2:22:21.380\n That's an argument that I am myself personally\n\n2:22:22.700 --> 2:22:24.420\n conflicted about.\n\n2:22:24.420 --> 2:22:27.260\n On the one hand, I think, you know,\n\n2:22:27.260 --> 2:22:29.380\n those people are just stupid.\n\n2:22:29.380 --> 2:22:32.940\n It is racist, okay?\n\n2:22:32.940 --> 2:22:36.500\n On the other hand, I think the calculation,\n\n2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:38.180\n we shouldn't do this kind of research.\n\n2:22:38.180 --> 2:22:40.060\n Suppose I'm at the National Science Foundation,\n\n2:22:40.060 --> 2:22:42.340\n a research team submits a proposal.\n\n2:22:42.340 --> 2:22:44.780\n The proposal proposes to undertake a study.\n\n2:22:44.780 --> 2:22:48.540\n The study would explore the extent to which people\n\n2:22:48.540 --> 2:22:50.500\n and racial groups differ with respect\n\n2:22:50.500 --> 2:22:52.500\n to their intellectual performance\n\n2:22:52.500 --> 2:22:55.020\n and how that's influenced by their genetic\n\n2:22:55.020 --> 2:22:56.860\n and environmental interaction.\n\n2:22:56.860 --> 2:22:59.140\n And I decide not to fund the study\n\n2:22:59.140 --> 2:23:01.820\n based on a political calculation\n\n2:23:01.820 --> 2:23:04.580\n that the subject is too sensitive.\n\n2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:06.580\n And if you explore that subject,\n\n2:23:06.580 --> 2:23:08.260\n you might get the wrong answer.\n\n2:23:08.260 --> 2:23:09.900\n And if you get the wrong answer,\n\n2:23:09.900 --> 2:23:12.460\n the white supremacist will be encouraged.\n\n2:23:12.460 --> 2:23:17.460\n Well, that is presuming before the research is done\n\n2:23:17.740 --> 2:23:19.780\n that I know the outcome of the research\n\n2:23:19.780 --> 2:23:23.060\n and that I can calculate what the political consequence\n\n2:23:23.060 --> 2:23:25.260\n of the research outcome is gonna be.\n\n2:23:25.260 --> 2:23:27.660\n That's assuming the thing before you even know\n\n2:23:27.660 --> 2:23:28.940\n what the thing actually is.\n\n2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:30.380\n It's a kind of omniscience.\n\n2:23:30.380 --> 2:23:35.380\n It presumes that you as the master of the universe\n\n2:23:35.620 --> 2:23:37.180\n can tell people what it is\n\n2:23:37.180 --> 2:23:39.380\n that people are being treated like children,\n\n2:23:39.380 --> 2:23:41.540\n what it is that they're capable of knowing\n\n2:23:41.540 --> 2:23:44.060\n and what it is that they're not capable of knowing.\n\n2:23:44.060 --> 2:23:47.460\n It would be like someone saying to Einstein,\n\n2:23:47.460 --> 2:23:49.740\n I don't know about that special relativity theory.\n\n2:23:49.740 --> 2:23:50.940\n You know, it could well lead\n\n2:23:50.940 --> 2:23:53.140\n to the development of technologies\n\n2:23:53.140 --> 2:23:54.420\n that would allow nuclear weapons.\n\n2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:55.780\n Or someone saying to Oppenheimer,\n\n2:23:55.780 --> 2:23:58.860\n who is a physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project\n\n2:23:58.860 --> 2:24:02.180\n where the US developed a nuclear weapons capacity,\n\n2:24:02.180 --> 2:24:04.180\n don't carry out that project\n\n2:24:04.180 --> 2:24:08.300\n because the results of acquiring that knowledge\n\n2:24:08.300 --> 2:24:10.420\n may be more than we can deal with.\n\n2:24:10.420 --> 2:24:13.700\n Or someone saying to someone doing biomedical research\n\n2:24:13.700 --> 2:24:18.700\n who's interested in exploring the nature of the human genome,\n\n2:24:19.260 --> 2:24:20.900\n don't carry out that experiment,\n\n2:24:20.900 --> 2:24:22.740\n that cloning, undertaking, whatever,\n\n2:24:22.740 --> 2:24:26.020\n because the consequences could be deleterious.\n\n2:24:26.020 --> 2:24:27.820\n Well, the consequences could be deleterious.\n\n2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:30.220\n The consequences could also be the cure of cancer.\n\n2:24:30.220 --> 2:24:32.140\n The consequences could also be\n\n2:24:32.140 --> 2:24:33.740\n being able to generate electric power\n\n2:24:33.740 --> 2:24:36.780\n without producing carbon effluent.\n\n2:24:36.780 --> 2:24:38.940\n So who are you to tell me,\n\n2:24:38.940 --> 2:24:42.140\n you being the person in the political position\n\n2:24:42.140 --> 2:24:44.180\n to control the research,\n\n2:24:44.180 --> 2:24:46.140\n what the consequence of doing the research is?\n\n2:24:46.140 --> 2:24:50.860\n I think I don't want to cede that kind of power\n\n2:24:50.860 --> 2:24:55.860\n to politicians over the course of human inquiry.\n\n2:24:55.860 --> 2:24:59.700\n So yes, I would want there to be regulations\n\n2:24:59.700 --> 2:25:03.860\n governing the use of biologically sensitive\n\n2:25:03.860 --> 2:25:06.580\n and potentially dangerous pathogens\n\n2:25:06.580 --> 2:25:10.060\n in a lab in Wuhan or any place else.\n\n2:25:10.060 --> 2:25:13.260\n I would not want to simply leave that to laissez faire.\n\n2:25:13.260 --> 2:25:16.660\n On the other hand, I think that the tendency\n\n2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:19.700\n to try to shut down inquiry\n\n2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:24.220\n on behalf of supposed adverse political consequences\n\n2:25:24.220 --> 2:25:27.620\n is the road to ignorance and impoverishment\n\n2:25:27.620 --> 2:25:29.460\n at the end of the day for humankind,\n\n2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:31.580\n denying ourselves the potential benefits\n\n2:25:31.580 --> 2:25:33.060\n of that kind of inquiry.\n\n2:25:33.060 --> 2:25:35.660\n I think we need to take our chances with inquiry\n\n2:25:35.660 --> 2:25:37.060\n rather than to try to control it.\n\n2:25:37.060 --> 2:25:39.380\n And I feel that way about the exploration\n\n2:25:39.380 --> 2:25:42.780\n of human intelligence as much as anything else.\n\n2:25:42.780 --> 2:25:44.660\n So you've asked me to steel man the case\n\n2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:47.540\n against research on IQ of the sort\n\n2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:51.180\n that Charles Murray is famous for popularizing.\n\n2:25:51.180 --> 2:25:54.780\n And I've said A, your measure of intelligence\n\n2:25:54.780 --> 2:25:58.340\n is single dimensional and it ought to be multi dimensional.\n\n2:25:58.340 --> 2:26:02.020\n I've said B, the consequences of people's differing\n\n2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:03.980\n in intelligence depends not only\n\n2:26:03.980 --> 2:26:05.860\n on the natural endowments of the people\n\n2:26:05.860 --> 2:26:08.740\n but also on the environment\n\n2:26:08.740 --> 2:26:12.300\n and the potential for intervening in that environment\n\n2:26:12.300 --> 2:26:14.340\n through one or another kind of instrument\n\n2:26:14.340 --> 2:26:18.340\n as the metaphorical example of the use of corrective lenses\n\n2:26:18.340 --> 2:26:20.620\n to level the playing field between people\n\n2:26:20.620 --> 2:26:25.020\n with different visual acuity indicates.\n\n2:26:25.020 --> 2:26:28.020\n But finally, I've said, yes,\n\n2:26:28.020 --> 2:26:31.700\n research on racial differences in IQ can foster\n\n2:26:33.060 --> 2:26:38.060\n political beliefs that we would regard to be noxious.\n\n2:26:38.300 --> 2:26:41.660\n On the other hand, to presume that what we don't know yet\n\n2:26:41.660 --> 2:26:44.900\n and might find out from the research is gonna be harmful\n\n2:26:44.900 --> 2:26:48.260\n is to assume a kind of presumption\n\n2:26:48.260 --> 2:26:52.820\n or of knowing what the outcome of unknown processes might be\n\n2:26:52.820 --> 2:26:55.740\n which we ought to be very slow to embrace\n\n2:26:55.740 --> 2:26:57.820\n because if we had done so in the past,\n\n2:26:57.820 --> 2:26:59.980\n we wouldn't have nuclear power.\n\n2:26:59.980 --> 2:27:01.180\n There's a lot of things that we wouldn't know.\n\n2:27:01.180 --> 2:27:03.340\n I mean, what were people saying about Darwin\n\n2:27:03.340 --> 2:27:06.220\n and exploration of the evolution\n\n2:27:06.220 --> 2:27:07.940\n and origin of the species?\n\n2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:10.380\n They were afraid that it was gonna, in effect,\n\n2:27:10.380 --> 2:27:13.380\n disprove the religious based accounts\n\n2:27:13.380 --> 2:27:16.300\n of what were they saying about Copernicus\n\n2:27:16.300 --> 2:27:17.780\n and et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:27:17.780 --> 2:27:19.780\n So, you know.\n\n2:27:19.780 --> 2:27:24.780\n That was a masterful layering of, quote,\n\n2:27:24.780 --> 2:27:26.860\n wrestling with cognitive inequality.\n\n2:27:26.860 --> 2:27:28.620\n You dragged in nuclear research,\n\n2:27:29.700 --> 2:27:32.820\n Copernicus, Darwin, biomedical research with genetics,\n\n2:27:32.820 --> 2:27:37.180\n even COVID and the lab leak.\n\n2:27:37.180 --> 2:27:39.940\n I mean, that was just fun to listen to.\n\n2:27:39.940 --> 2:27:40.780\n Okay. Okay.\n\n2:27:42.980 --> 2:27:44.900\n Let me ask you about your politics.\n\n2:27:44.900 --> 2:27:48.420\n So you've recently said that you're a conservative leaning.\n\n2:27:48.420 --> 2:27:51.060\n I mean, maybe that's a day to day thing.\n\n2:27:51.060 --> 2:27:52.100\n Maybe you can push back.\n\n2:27:52.100 --> 2:27:55.860\n But so you have somebody like your friend, John McWhorter,\n\n2:27:56.820 --> 2:28:01.740\n who we could say is on your left, to the left of you.\n\n2:28:01.740 --> 2:28:05.660\n And then you have somebody like Thomas Sowell\n\n2:28:05.660 --> 2:28:09.460\n who maybe is on to the right of you.\n\n2:28:09.460 --> 2:28:10.780\n Yeah, probably.\n\n2:28:10.780 --> 2:28:14.060\n And yet there's a lot of overlap between the three of you.\n\n2:28:14.060 --> 2:28:19.060\n So to what degree does politics affect your view on race\n\n2:28:19.700 --> 2:28:21.020\n in America?\n\n2:28:21.020 --> 2:28:25.380\n And maybe to what degree does your view on race\n\n2:28:25.380 --> 2:28:26.740\n affect your politics?\n\n2:28:28.580 --> 2:28:29.420\n Okay.\n\n2:28:29.420 --> 2:28:33.860\n And that, for people who don't know, has shifted over time.\n\n2:28:33.860 --> 2:28:36.300\n You've been on quite a roller coaster,\n\n2:28:36.300 --> 2:28:38.820\n as anybody who thinks about the world should be.\n\n2:28:38.820 --> 2:28:43.060\n Well, let's begin with the fact that I was trained\n\n2:28:43.060 --> 2:28:48.060\n as an economist in a tradition of what many people\n\n2:28:48.060 --> 2:28:50.980\n would call neoliberalism.\n\n2:28:50.980 --> 2:28:55.980\n I was trained at MIT, which was not a right wing place\n\n2:28:56.220 --> 2:29:01.220\n by any means, but it was a place where you learned\n\n2:29:01.220 --> 2:29:06.220\n about markets and about the benefits of capitalism\n\n2:29:06.220 --> 2:29:10.740\n as a way of organizing society,\n\n2:29:10.740 --> 2:29:13.660\n the virtues of free enterprise,\n\n2:29:13.660 --> 2:29:15.460\n the fact that the pursuit of profit\n\n2:29:15.460 --> 2:29:17.220\n was not necessarily a bad thing,\n\n2:29:17.220 --> 2:29:20.140\n but it well might be the road to prosperity\n\n2:29:20.140 --> 2:29:21.780\n and to economic growth.\n\n2:29:21.780 --> 2:29:25.060\n The idea that private property and individuals seeking\n\n2:29:25.060 --> 2:29:27.900\n to acquire and succeeding in acquiring wealth\n\n2:29:28.900 --> 2:29:32.420\n did create inequality, but it also created opportunity.\n\n2:29:32.420 --> 2:29:36.060\n And it also expanded the ability to do things\n\n2:29:36.060 --> 2:29:38.540\n and expanded our knowledge and our control\n\n2:29:38.540 --> 2:29:41.100\n over the physical environment in which we're embedded\n\n2:29:41.100 --> 2:29:42.380\n and et cetera.\n\n2:29:44.580 --> 2:29:48.660\n So we were not Marxists at MIT, although we did read Marx.\n\n2:29:48.660 --> 2:29:50.580\n I mean, those of us who were intellectually curious,\n\n2:29:50.580 --> 2:29:51.420\n you read Marx.\n\n2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:54.380\n Marx was an important figure in the history of the West.\n\n2:29:54.380 --> 2:29:57.940\n And I think Marx should be read in capital three volumes,\n\n2:29:57.940 --> 2:30:02.220\n et cetera, alienation of labor and whatnot.\n\n2:30:02.220 --> 2:30:04.820\n The implications of modernization,\n\n2:30:04.820 --> 2:30:08.940\n the advent of industrial capitalism, et cetera.\n\n2:30:08.940 --> 2:30:12.500\n That kind of dynamic deserves to be studied\n\n2:30:12.500 --> 2:30:15.100\n and to come at it in a critical way,\n\n2:30:16.380 --> 2:30:21.380\n informed by the intellectual inheritance of Marx and Marxism.\n\n2:30:21.580 --> 2:30:23.860\n I think that's a part of a full education\n\n2:30:23.860 --> 2:30:28.340\n in social philosophy and economic analysis\n\n2:30:28.340 --> 2:30:32.340\n that an open minded person ought to acquaint themselves with.\n\n2:30:32.340 --> 2:30:33.180\n But at the end of the day,\n\n2:30:33.180 --> 2:30:38.180\n I think that the free marketeers have the better of it.\n\n2:30:41.260 --> 2:30:43.220\n I think the story of the 20th century\n\n2:30:43.220 --> 2:30:47.900\n as far as economic development is concerned reflects that.\n\n2:30:47.900 --> 2:30:52.100\n I think that the experiments where centralized control\n\n2:30:52.100 --> 2:30:57.100\n over economic decisions was the order of the day failed.\n\n2:30:57.740 --> 2:31:01.900\n I think that the fact of the 21st century rise of China\n\n2:31:01.900 --> 2:31:05.660\n as a force has a lot to do with the spread of,\n\n2:31:05.660 --> 2:31:08.780\n in effect, capitalist oriented modes\n\n2:31:08.780 --> 2:31:11.500\n of entering economic exchange,\n\n2:31:11.500 --> 2:31:15.540\n freeing up prices, markets, property, and so forth.\n\n2:31:15.540 --> 2:31:18.060\n Although obviously it's a complicated\n\n2:31:18.060 --> 2:31:21.380\n political economic system, we're talking about China.\n\n2:31:21.380 --> 2:31:26.100\n But I think that the story of the 20th century\n\n2:31:26.100 --> 2:31:28.300\n and the hope for the 21st century\n\n2:31:28.300 --> 2:31:33.300\n is that prosperity is enhanced through the free exchange\n\n2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:39.900\n of goods and the pursuit and acquisition of property\n\n2:31:40.140 --> 2:31:45.140\n by people in a more or less capitalist oriented system.\n\n2:31:46.740 --> 2:31:49.860\n That's the view that I hold.\n\n2:31:49.860 --> 2:31:52.340\n I guess that makes me a conservative, I don't know.\n\n2:31:52.340 --> 2:31:56.580\n I wanna say that's not to the exclusion\n\n2:31:56.580 --> 2:31:58.420\n of a social safety net.\n\n2:31:58.420 --> 2:32:02.820\n I'm not saying that old people in an ideal social system\n\n2:32:02.820 --> 2:32:04.460\n would be left to their own devices\n\n2:32:04.460 --> 2:32:05.420\n regardless of whether or not\n\n2:32:05.420 --> 2:32:07.340\n they had saved for their retirement.\n\n2:32:07.340 --> 2:32:12.340\n I'm not saying that the ideal of extending decent access\n\n2:32:13.900 --> 2:32:15.860\n to healthcare to all people regardless\n\n2:32:15.860 --> 2:32:18.020\n of whether or not they can afford it,\n\n2:32:18.020 --> 2:32:20.820\n decent access to education to people\n\n2:32:20.820 --> 2:32:22.940\n regardless of whether or not they can afford it\n\n2:32:22.940 --> 2:32:25.700\n is standing in the way of prosperity.\n\n2:32:25.700 --> 2:32:26.980\n I don't believe that.\n\n2:32:26.980 --> 2:32:29.580\n I think the mixed economies that we see in Northern Europe\n\n2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:34.580\n and in North America are a balancing\n\n2:32:35.020 --> 2:32:37.900\n of the virtues of free enterprise property\n\n2:32:37.900 --> 2:32:40.500\n and the pursuit of wealth on the one hand\n\n2:32:40.500 --> 2:32:44.220\n against the needs to have a decent society\n\n2:32:44.220 --> 2:32:47.700\n in which people who fall between the cracks nevertheless\n\n2:32:47.700 --> 2:32:51.620\n are bolstered through a sense of social solidarity\n\n2:32:51.620 --> 2:32:54.540\n that is accommodated by our common membership\n\n2:32:54.540 --> 2:32:56.900\n within a single nation state,\n\n2:32:56.900 --> 2:32:59.300\n which is why I think nationalism is important.\n\n2:32:59.300 --> 2:33:02.140\n And it's why I think borders are important\n\n2:33:02.140 --> 2:33:06.500\n because without a coherent polity\n\n2:33:06.500 --> 2:33:11.500\n who can see themselves as in a common situation\n\n2:33:12.100 --> 2:33:15.100\n and agree through their politics\n\n2:33:15.100 --> 2:33:17.540\n to support each other to some extent,\n\n2:33:17.540 --> 2:33:18.980\n you can't sustain a safety net.\n\n2:33:18.980 --> 2:33:23.100\n You cannot have a social safety net for a global population.\n\n2:33:23.100 --> 2:33:24.660\n You can only have a social safety net\n\n2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:28.220\n for a bounded population who have a sense\n\n2:33:28.220 --> 2:33:33.060\n of common membership in an ongoing political enterprise\n\n2:33:33.060 --> 2:33:35.660\n which they pay their dues through their taxes\n\n2:33:35.660 --> 2:33:36.980\n in order to sustain it.\n\n2:33:36.980 --> 2:33:38.900\n There's a balancing that has to go on.\n\n2:33:38.900 --> 2:33:42.180\n So that's the first thing that I would say about my politics.\n\n2:33:42.180 --> 2:33:44.020\n I'm a neoliberal economist.\n\n2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.100\n I believe in markets.\n\n2:33:45.100 --> 2:33:46.180\n I believe in prices.\n\n2:33:46.180 --> 2:33:47.780\n I believe in profit.\n\n2:33:47.780 --> 2:33:51.060\n Corporations are not an incarnation of evil.\n\n2:33:51.060 --> 2:33:53.500\n Corporations are a legal nexus\n\n2:33:53.500 --> 2:33:56.620\n through which production gets organized\n\n2:33:56.620 --> 2:34:00.500\n in which you solicit the cooperation of workers,\n\n2:34:00.500 --> 2:34:02.380\n of people who provide capital,\n\n2:34:02.380 --> 2:34:04.060\n of people who provide raw materials\n\n2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:06.740\n and input of customers and so on.\n\n2:34:06.740 --> 2:34:11.740\n And that functionality allows for the production of goods\n\n2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:16.620\n and their distribution and their earning of income\n\n2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:18.820\n and its distribution,\n\n2:34:18.820 --> 2:34:21.340\n which at the end of the day is the foundation\n\n2:34:21.340 --> 2:34:22.180\n of our prosperity.\n\n2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:23.460\n Corporations are people too.\n\n2:34:23.460 --> 2:34:26.660\n Mitt Romney got in trouble for saying that in 2012.\n\n2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:28.740\n But corporations are nothing but a legal fiction.\n\n2:34:28.740 --> 2:34:32.140\n The corporation is not a person as such,\n\n2:34:32.140 --> 2:34:35.100\n but the nexus of contracts and relationships\n\n2:34:35.100 --> 2:34:38.060\n amongst the stakeholders who intersect\n\n2:34:38.060 --> 2:34:41.340\n in the context of the corporation\n\n2:34:41.340 --> 2:34:43.220\n is the way in which we organize\n\n2:34:43.220 --> 2:34:46.380\n the massively complex set of activities\n\n2:34:46.380 --> 2:34:50.980\n that are necessary in order to produce economic benefits,\n\n2:34:50.980 --> 2:34:52.060\n in order to feed people,\n\n2:34:52.060 --> 2:34:55.020\n in order to have everybody with a cell phone in their pocket,\n\n2:34:55.020 --> 2:34:57.900\n in order to be able to travel from one side of a continent\n\n2:34:57.900 --> 2:35:01.700\n to another on a device that is with almost absolute certainty\n\n2:35:01.700 --> 2:35:04.020\n gonna safely take off and land\n\n2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:07.540\n and in order to be able to build cities and et cetera.\n\n2:35:07.540 --> 2:35:10.620\n But do the markets, the ideal of the market\n\n2:35:10.620 --> 2:35:14.980\n collide with the ideal of all men are created equal?\n\n2:35:14.980 --> 2:35:17.780\n The identity, the struggle that we've been talking about\n\n2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:21.380\n of what it means to sort of empower humans\n\n2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:23.340\n that make up this great country.\n\n2:35:23.340 --> 2:35:26.340\n Do they collide and where do they collide?\n\n2:35:26.340 --> 2:35:29.380\n Well, markets are gonna produce inequality\n\n2:35:29.380 --> 2:35:32.260\n and all men being equal is a statement\n\n2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:34.460\n about the intrinsic worth of people,\n\n2:35:34.460 --> 2:35:36.980\n not about the situation that will come about\n\n2:35:36.980 --> 2:35:39.340\n when people interact with each other through markets\n\n2:35:39.340 --> 2:35:41.860\n because people are actually different\n\n2:35:41.860 --> 2:35:43.140\n and because there are factors\n\n2:35:43.140 --> 2:35:46.260\n that are beyond anybody's control called luck and chance\n\n2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:49.300\n that you and I both invest.\n\n2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:51.580\n It looked a priori like your investment and my investment\n\n2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:53.660\n were equally likely to succeed.\n\n2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:55.660\n But as a matter of fact, ex post facto,\n\n2:35:55.660 --> 2:35:58.900\n your investment succeeds, my investment doesn't succeed.\n\n2:35:58.900 --> 2:36:01.060\n I don't have wealth and you have wealth.\n\n2:36:01.060 --> 2:36:04.300\n That is an inevitable consequence of a environment\n\n2:36:04.300 --> 2:36:07.660\n in which both of us are free to make our investment choices\n\n2:36:07.660 --> 2:36:09.860\n and where the consequences of investment\n\n2:36:09.860 --> 2:36:12.660\n depend in part upon random circumstances\n\n2:36:12.660 --> 2:36:14.820\n of which no one has control.\n\n2:36:14.820 --> 2:36:16.420\n But you asked me about my politics\n\n2:36:16.420 --> 2:36:18.460\n and I was just trying to lay down a foundation\n\n2:36:18.460 --> 2:36:22.500\n by saying I begin as an economist\n\n2:36:22.500 --> 2:36:27.020\n in the tradition of liberalism, Adam Smith and so forth,\n\n2:36:27.020 --> 2:36:29.420\n John Maynard Keynes for that matter and so forth,\n\n2:36:30.380 --> 2:36:34.460\n that Milton Friedman and so forth,\n\n2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:39.460\n that Paul Samuelson, Bob Solla, James Tobin and so forth,\n\n2:36:39.460 --> 2:36:44.460\n Thomas Sowell, yes, that appreciates property,\n\n2:36:44.660 --> 2:36:46.740\n the virtues of free enterprise,\n\n2:36:46.740 --> 2:36:51.740\n the set of institutions that allow for security of contract,\n\n2:36:53.220 --> 2:36:56.180\n a rule of law, things of this kind.\n\n2:36:56.180 --> 2:36:59.140\n So that's one thing to say about my politics.\n\n2:36:59.140 --> 2:37:01.140\n Another thing to say about my politics and you're right,\n\n2:37:01.140 --> 2:37:06.140\n I've moved around, is that I began south side of Chicago,\n\n2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:09.460\n black kid, I was a liberal Democrat.\n\n2:37:09.460 --> 2:37:14.460\n I encountered the economics curriculum at the MIT\n\n2:37:14.620 --> 2:37:16.660\n and I became trained in economics\n\n2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:18.860\n in the tradition that I've just described.\n\n2:37:19.980 --> 2:37:24.300\n And I encountered also the Reagan Revolution.\n\n2:37:24.300 --> 2:37:27.260\n This is the late 70s and early 80s.\n\n2:37:27.260 --> 2:37:31.260\n These are big debates about economic policy and so on.\n\n2:37:31.260 --> 2:37:36.260\n And I found a lot to admire in the supply side errors,\n\n2:37:37.900 --> 2:37:39.060\n the people were saying,\n\n2:37:39.060 --> 2:37:41.020\n let's get the government out of the way,\n\n2:37:41.020 --> 2:37:43.060\n the people who were worried about national debt,\n\n2:37:43.060 --> 2:37:45.300\n which is a lot more now than it was then,\n\n2:37:46.300 --> 2:37:47.140\n the people who were worried\n\n2:37:47.140 --> 2:37:48.940\n that the welfare state could be too big,\n\n2:37:48.940 --> 2:37:51.060\n that the incentives of transfer programs\n\n2:37:51.060 --> 2:37:54.100\n could be counterproductive, that you had a war on poverty\n\n2:37:54.100 --> 2:37:56.700\n and we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.\n\n2:37:56.700 --> 2:37:58.420\n And that's what I found.\n\n2:37:58.420 --> 2:38:01.420\n And we did have a war on poverty and poverty won.\n\n2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:04.460\n And there's a lot of evidence that the war on poverty\n\n2:38:04.460 --> 2:38:07.300\n was lost by the people who were trying to, quote unquote,\n\n2:38:07.300 --> 2:38:09.060\n eradicate poverty in our time.\n\n2:38:10.780 --> 2:38:13.580\n That incentives really do matter\n\n2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:17.500\n and that the state, which is driven by politics,\n\n2:38:17.500 --> 2:38:20.700\n is often unresponsive to the dictates of incentives.\n\n2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:24.380\n Whereas markets eliminate people who are inefficient\n\n2:38:24.380 --> 2:38:27.180\n and who are not cognizant of the consequences of incentives\n\n2:38:27.180 --> 2:38:29.540\n because they can't cover their bottom line\n\n2:38:29.540 --> 2:38:31.420\n and they won't persist for very long.\n\n2:38:31.420 --> 2:38:32.700\n If they can't cover their bottom line,\n\n2:38:32.700 --> 2:38:35.900\n they're forced to respond to the realities of differences\n\n2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:37.580\n and costs and benefits and so forth\n\n2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:39.620\n in a way that governments can cover\n\n2:38:39.620 --> 2:38:42.100\n because they have their hand in our pocket.\n\n2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:43.940\n They can cover their losses\n\n2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:46.260\n and they can make accounts balanced,\n\n2:38:46.260 --> 2:38:47.460\n not withstanding their mistakes\n\n2:38:47.460 --> 2:38:51.140\n because they can take my property by fiat,\n\n2:38:51.140 --> 2:38:53.420\n by the power of the state, the tax collector comes,\n\n2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:56.180\n if I don't pay, he seizes my holdings.\n\n2:38:56.180 --> 2:38:59.100\n And they can carry on in that way.\n\n2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:02.820\n They need the corrective influence of markets\n\n2:39:02.820 --> 2:39:05.580\n in order to be responsive to the realities of life.\n\n2:39:05.580 --> 2:39:10.580\n I mean, I may not like it that prices are telling me\n\n2:39:10.580 --> 2:39:12.900\n that something that I wanna do is infeasible.\n\n2:39:12.900 --> 2:39:15.740\n I may not like it, but what the prices are telling me\n\n2:39:15.740 --> 2:39:20.340\n is that the costs of doing it exceed the benefits\n\n2:39:20.340 --> 2:39:22.060\n to be derived from doing it.\n\n2:39:22.060 --> 2:39:24.220\n And if I persist in doing it not withstanding that,\n\n2:39:24.220 --> 2:39:25.500\n I'm gonna run losses.\n\n2:39:25.500 --> 2:39:26.980\n And those losses will accumulate.\n\n2:39:26.980 --> 2:39:30.900\n And the net effect of that over an entire society\n\n2:39:30.900 --> 2:39:34.580\n is stagnation and ultimate attenuation\n\n2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:36.060\n of the economic benefits\n\n2:39:36.060 --> 2:39:37.260\n that might be available to people.\n\n2:39:37.260 --> 2:39:40.620\n Again, I think if you look at the developing world\n\n2:39:40.620 --> 2:39:42.100\n in the postcolonial period,\n\n2:39:42.100 --> 2:39:44.020\n the second half of the 20th century,\n\n2:39:44.020 --> 2:39:46.060\n that's exactly what you see.\n\n2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:48.060\n Planning doesn't work.\n\n2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:50.740\n Centralized control over resource allocation doesn't work.\n\n2:39:50.740 --> 2:39:54.860\n Okay, so I became more conservative in that respect,\n\n2:39:54.860 --> 2:39:57.300\n but I also, and this has to do with race,\n\n2:39:59.380 --> 2:40:04.380\n lost the faith in the posture\n\n2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:08.820\n that what became of the civil rights movement.\n\n2:40:08.820 --> 2:40:11.740\n I mean, the civil rights movement, you quote King 1963,\n\n2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:13.780\n the civil rights movement starts out as\n\n2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:17.940\n we want equal membership in the polity,\n\n2:40:17.940 --> 2:40:22.940\n but it becomes a systematized cover I'm going to argue\n\n2:40:29.540 --> 2:40:34.540\n for deficiencies that are discernible\n\n2:40:35.300 --> 2:40:38.940\n within black American society, which only we could correct.\n\n2:40:38.940 --> 2:40:40.780\n That's a very controversial statement.\n\n2:40:40.780 --> 2:40:43.540\n I make it with trepidation.\n\n2:40:43.540 --> 2:40:47.340\n I don't take any pleasure in saying it,\n\n2:40:47.340 --> 2:40:49.020\n but here's what I'm talking about.\n\n2:40:50.540 --> 2:40:52.300\n So I'm talking about the family.\n\n2:40:53.260 --> 2:40:58.260\n So the family is a matter internal to the community\n\n2:41:00.020 --> 2:41:03.260\n about how men and women relate to each other\n\n2:41:03.260 --> 2:41:06.500\n and engage in social reproduction, childbearing,\n\n2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:09.780\n the standing up of households,\n\n2:41:09.780 --> 2:41:12.340\n the context within which children are developed,\n\n2:41:12.340 --> 2:41:14.660\n are maturing and so forth and so on.\n\n2:41:14.660 --> 2:41:17.700\n So the African American family is in trouble.\n\n2:41:17.700 --> 2:41:20.300\n I think I can demonstrate that\n\n2:41:20.300 --> 2:41:24.340\n by reference to high rates of marital dissolution,\n\n2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:29.020\n by high rates of birth to out of wedlock and so forth.\n\n2:41:31.100 --> 2:41:32.020\n You can't even say that\n\n2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:34.700\n the African American family is in trouble.\n\n2:41:34.700 --> 2:41:39.340\n Violence, homicide is an order of magnitude more prevalent\n\n2:41:39.340 --> 2:41:40.900\n amongst African Americans than it is\n\n2:41:40.900 --> 2:41:43.020\n in the society as a whole.\n\n2:41:43.020 --> 2:41:46.460\n This is behavior, it's behavior of our people.\n\n2:41:46.460 --> 2:41:47.580\n I speak of black people.\n\n2:41:47.580 --> 2:41:49.740\n Of course, we're not the only people in society\n\n2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:51.620\n for whom violence is an issue.\n\n2:41:51.620 --> 2:41:56.620\n It's an order of magnitude more prevalent in our communities.\n\n2:41:56.820 --> 2:42:00.180\n I'm talking about schooling and school failure.\n\n2:42:00.180 --> 2:42:02.780\n So we have affirmative action as a cover.\n\n2:42:02.780 --> 2:42:06.020\n It's a bandaid on differences in the development\n\n2:42:06.020 --> 2:42:07.980\n of intellectual performance,\n\n2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:10.260\n which is only partly a consequence\n\n2:42:10.260 --> 2:42:12.780\n of the natural intelligence of people\n\n2:42:12.780 --> 2:42:16.700\n and largely a consequence of how people spend their time,\n\n2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:20.140\n what they value, how they discipline themselves,\n\n2:42:20.140 --> 2:42:23.740\n what they do with their opportunities,\n\n2:42:23.740 --> 2:42:25.860\n how parents raise their children,\n\n2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:28.500\n what peer groups value and things of this kind.\n\n2:42:28.500 --> 2:42:30.940\n The Asian students who are scoring off the charts\n\n2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:33.220\n on these exams are doing it\n\n2:42:33.220 --> 2:42:35.420\n not because they're intrinsically more intelligent\n\n2:42:35.420 --> 2:42:38.220\n to other people, but because they work harder,\n\n2:42:38.220 --> 2:42:39.820\n because their parents are more insistent\n\n2:42:39.820 --> 2:42:43.220\n on focusing on their intellectual performance\n\n2:42:43.220 --> 2:42:45.100\n because they're disciplined,\n\n2:42:45.100 --> 2:42:46.900\n because of the way that they devote their time\n\n2:42:46.900 --> 2:42:50.420\n and their resources to equipping their children\n\n2:42:50.420 --> 2:42:52.540\n to function in the 21st century.\n\n2:42:52.540 --> 2:42:53.460\n This is what I believe.\n\n2:42:53.460 --> 2:42:55.500\n I think it's demonstrably the case.\n\n2:42:56.420 --> 2:43:00.140\n And it is a factor in racial disparity.\n\n2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:03.020\n The way that the civil rights movement has evolved\n\n2:43:03.020 --> 2:43:05.940\n under the wing of the Democratic Party\n\n2:43:05.940 --> 2:43:10.940\n into an organized apologia for the failures\n\n2:43:11.660 --> 2:43:14.180\n of African Americans to seize the opportunities\n\n2:43:14.180 --> 2:43:17.500\n that exist for us now in the 21st century,\n\n2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:21.140\n but did not exist in the first half of the 20th century,\n\n2:43:21.140 --> 2:43:22.740\n the way in which the civil rights movement\n\n2:43:22.740 --> 2:43:27.300\n has become an avoidance mechanism\n\n2:43:27.300 --> 2:43:29.940\n for us not taking we African Americans responsible.\n\n2:43:29.940 --> 2:43:30.780\n This is Glenn Loury.\n\n2:43:30.780 --> 2:43:33.260\n Not everybody's gonna agree with it.\n\n2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:36.780\n It's part of what makes me a conservative.\n\n2:43:36.780 --> 2:43:38.940\n I am tired of the bellyaching.\n\n2:43:38.940 --> 2:43:42.380\n I'm tired of the excuse me, white supremacy.\n\n2:43:42.380 --> 2:43:45.660\n It is in my mind, a joke.\n\n2:43:45.660 --> 2:43:49.300\n I lament the fact that that kind of rhetoric\n\n2:43:49.300 --> 2:43:53.940\n is so seductively attractive to African Americans\n\n2:43:53.940 --> 2:43:57.580\n and so widely adopted by others.\n\n2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:02.900\n And as I am fond of saying, at the end of the day,\n\n2:44:02.900 --> 2:44:04.860\n nobody is coming to save us.\n\n2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:09.380\n I mean, higher education, MIT, Caltech, Stanford,\n\n2:44:10.820 --> 2:44:12.340\n where the future is happening,\n\n2:44:13.660 --> 2:44:17.980\n that is about mastery over the achievements\n\n2:44:17.980 --> 2:44:21.500\n of human civilization, such as they manifest themselves\n\n2:44:21.500 --> 2:44:22.340\n in the 21st century.\n\n2:44:22.340 --> 2:44:26.380\n There's no substitute for actually acquiring mastery\n\n2:44:26.380 --> 2:44:27.380\n over the material.\n\n2:44:27.380 --> 2:44:33.380\n There's no substitute for that to be patronized,\n\n2:44:33.700 --> 2:44:34.860\n to have the standards lowered.\n\n2:44:34.860 --> 2:44:37.100\n They wanna get rid of the test.\n\n2:44:37.100 --> 2:44:40.220\n They wanna tell African Americans to pat us on the head.\n\n2:44:41.140 --> 2:44:43.020\n We're gonna have a separate program for you.\n\n2:44:43.020 --> 2:44:45.820\n We're gonna give you a side door that you can come into.\n\n2:44:45.820 --> 2:44:48.060\n That doesn't make us any smarter.\n\n2:44:48.060 --> 2:44:49.940\n It doesn't make us any more creative.\n\n2:44:51.020 --> 2:44:54.820\n And it doesn't make us any more fit\n\n2:44:54.820 --> 2:44:58.300\n for the actual competition that's unfolding before us.\n\n2:44:58.300 --> 2:45:01.340\n Now, you wanna be 10% of the population\n\n2:45:01.340 --> 2:45:03.900\n that's carried along for the next 100 years?\n\n2:45:03.900 --> 2:45:09.020\n You wanna be a ward of the state in the late 21st century?\n\n2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:10.100\n You go ahead.\n\n2:45:10.100 --> 2:45:12.100\n Because the Chinese are coming.\n\n2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:13.660\n You're not gonna hold them back.\n\n2:45:13.660 --> 2:45:16.300\n The world is being remade every decade\n\n2:45:16.300 --> 2:45:19.580\n by new ways of seeing and new ways of doing.\n\n2:45:19.580 --> 2:45:23.700\n If you don't get on board with the dynamic advancement\n\n2:45:23.700 --> 2:45:26.100\n of the civilization in which we are embedded,\n\n2:45:26.100 --> 2:45:29.380\n you're gonna end up being dependent on other people\n\n2:45:29.380 --> 2:45:31.300\n to look kindly upon you.\n\n2:45:31.300 --> 2:45:34.900\n And this story that you've got, this bellyache,\n\n2:45:35.940 --> 2:45:39.260\n this excuse, my ancestors were slaves,\n\n2:45:41.020 --> 2:45:45.020\n is only gonna work for so long.\n\n2:45:45.020 --> 2:45:49.060\n So that makes me, I suppose, a kind of conservative.\n\n2:45:49.060 --> 2:45:51.340\n I hate affirmative action.\n\n2:45:51.340 --> 2:45:52.500\n I don't just disagree with it.\n\n2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:55.340\n I don't just think it's against the 14th amendment.\n\n2:45:55.340 --> 2:45:56.900\n I hate it.\n\n2:45:56.900 --> 2:45:58.860\n The hatred comes from an understanding\n\n2:45:58.860 --> 2:46:01.380\n that it is a bandaid, that it is a substitute\n\n2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:03.740\n for the actual development of the capacities\n\n2:46:03.740 --> 2:46:05.540\n of our people to compete.\n\n2:46:05.540 --> 2:46:08.300\n I'd much rather be in the position\n\n2:46:08.300 --> 2:46:10.700\n of having them try to keep me out\n\n2:46:10.700 --> 2:46:12.620\n because I'm so damn good,\n\n2:46:12.620 --> 2:46:15.140\n like they're doing with the Asians,\n\n2:46:15.140 --> 2:46:18.340\n than having them have to beg the Supreme Court\n\n2:46:18.340 --> 2:46:21.100\n to allow for a special dispensation on my behalf\n\n2:46:21.100 --> 2:46:25.620\n because they need diversity and inclusion and belonging.\n\n2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:27.060\n It's not just diversity.\n\n2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:28.540\n It's not just diversity and inclusion.\n\n2:46:28.540 --> 2:46:31.500\n It's diversity and inclusion and belonging.\n\n2:46:31.500 --> 2:46:34.540\n I'm whining because I feel like I don't belong.\n\n2:46:35.660 --> 2:46:37.380\n That's a position of weakness.\n\n2:46:37.380 --> 2:46:38.740\n It's pathetic.\n\n2:46:40.180 --> 2:46:42.140\n And it's only political correctness\n\n2:46:42.140 --> 2:46:43.780\n that keeps people who can see this,\n\n2:46:43.780 --> 2:46:45.860\n and believe me, a lot of people can see it\n\n2:46:47.340 --> 2:46:49.180\n from saying so out loud.\n\n2:46:49.180 --> 2:46:52.180\n So you want the black American community\n\n2:46:52.180 --> 2:46:54.180\n to represent strength.\n\n2:46:54.180 --> 2:46:56.900\n Correct, and I want us to deal with what it is\n\n2:46:56.900 --> 2:46:58.700\n that we have to deal with in order to be able\n\n2:46:58.700 --> 2:47:03.700\n to project strength in an increasingly competitive world.\n\n2:47:05.180 --> 2:47:06.380\n Let me ask you,\n\n2:47:08.900 --> 2:47:10.460\n I know you said you're angry\n\n2:47:12.180 --> 2:47:14.060\n or dislike affirmative action.\n\n2:47:14.060 --> 2:47:15.980\n Let me ask you about something\n\n2:47:15.980 --> 2:47:19.180\n that even to my ear cut wrong.\n\n2:47:20.420 --> 2:47:23.020\n Now I'm relatively apolitical.\n\n2:47:23.020 --> 2:47:27.180\n So President Biden, when he was running for president,\n\n2:47:27.180 --> 2:47:30.460\n gave a campaign promise that he will nominate\n\n2:47:30.460 --> 2:47:33.220\n a black woman to the US Supreme Court,\n\n2:47:33.220 --> 2:47:36.140\n saying, quote, the person I will nominate\n\n2:47:36.140 --> 2:47:39.180\n will be someone with extraordinary qualifications,\n\n2:47:39.180 --> 2:47:42.020\n character, experience, and integrity.\n\n2:47:42.020 --> 2:47:43.020\n First sentence.\n\n2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:44.380\n Second sentence.\n\n2:47:44.380 --> 2:47:46.940\n And that person will be the first black woman\n\n2:47:46.940 --> 2:47:50.660\n ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.\n\n2:47:50.660 --> 2:47:53.100\n Do you wish he only said the first sentence\n\n2:47:53.100 --> 2:47:54.380\n and not the second?\n\n2:47:55.220 --> 2:47:58.700\n Yes, I wish that he had only said the first sentence,\n\n2:47:58.700 --> 2:48:00.380\n even if his intention was to do\n\n2:48:00.380 --> 2:48:03.540\n what he said he was gonna do in the second sentence.\n\n2:48:03.540 --> 2:48:06.300\n In other words, I wish that he had simply said,\n\n2:48:06.300 --> 2:48:07.980\n if I have the opportunity to nominate someone\n\n2:48:07.980 --> 2:48:09.300\n to the Supreme Court, it's gonna be\n\n2:48:09.300 --> 2:48:13.020\n a superbly qualified person to carry out that position.\n\n2:48:13.020 --> 2:48:15.420\n And he might've kept to himself his intention\n\n2:48:16.340 --> 2:48:18.700\n to name an African American woman to that position.\n\n2:48:18.700 --> 2:48:21.060\n And then going ahead and named an African American woman\n\n2:48:21.060 --> 2:48:21.900\n to that position.\n\n2:48:21.900 --> 2:48:25.380\n And I'm sure that Katanji Brown Jackson,\n\n2:48:25.380 --> 2:48:27.180\n I don't doubt that she's exceptionally qualified.\n\n2:48:27.180 --> 2:48:28.660\n She has a distinguished career.\n\n2:48:28.660 --> 2:48:31.700\n She served as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n2:48:31.700 --> 2:48:33.020\n She's a graduate at Harvard Law School.\n\n2:48:33.020 --> 2:48:34.700\n She has a background.\n\n2:48:34.700 --> 2:48:39.540\n You do not have to be a world class\n\n2:48:39.540 --> 2:48:41.260\n constitutional legal scholar\n\n2:48:41.260 --> 2:48:43.660\n to get onto the United States Supreme Court.\n\n2:48:43.660 --> 2:48:45.820\n A lot of members of the United States Supreme Court\n\n2:48:45.820 --> 2:48:48.540\n have had different kinds of legal careers\n\n2:48:48.540 --> 2:48:51.540\n before they were elevated to that position.\n\n2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:56.540\n Earl Warren of the famed Warren Court of the 1950s and 60s\n\n2:48:57.180 --> 2:49:01.060\n was a politician as well as a leading jurist and whatnot.\n\n2:49:01.060 --> 2:49:03.180\n I mean, many kinds of people in the US Supreme Court.\n\n2:49:03.180 --> 2:49:06.940\n I have no doubt that Judge Katanji Brown Jackson\n\n2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:10.100\n is a qualified member to be on the Supreme Court.\n\n2:49:10.100 --> 2:49:13.780\n I wish that Biden had not done what he did.\n\n2:49:13.780 --> 2:49:16.140\n He could have just appointed a black woman\n\n2:49:16.140 --> 2:49:18.860\n by saying that he was limiting his considerations\n\n2:49:18.860 --> 2:49:19.700\n to black women.\n\n2:49:19.700 --> 2:49:21.180\n And what are black women as a percentage\n\n2:49:21.180 --> 2:49:24.940\n of all potential appointees to the Supreme Court?\n\n2:49:24.940 --> 2:49:28.580\n 3%, 4%, I don't know, we could look the number up.\n\n2:49:30.700 --> 2:49:33.460\n By saying that he puts an asterisk on the appointment,\n\n2:49:33.460 --> 2:49:34.660\n but it's worse than that\n\n2:49:35.940 --> 2:49:39.140\n because she will live down the asterisk\n\n2:49:39.140 --> 2:49:42.340\n if a person is inclined to do that.\n\n2:49:42.340 --> 2:49:44.140\n She will have the opportunity to show\n\n2:49:44.140 --> 2:49:47.300\n through her performance exactly what kind of juror she is.\n\n2:49:47.300 --> 2:49:49.820\n Just as Justice Clarence Thomas has shown\n\n2:49:49.820 --> 2:49:52.740\n through his performance that he was qualified\n\n2:49:52.740 --> 2:49:53.900\n and more than qualified to be\n\n2:49:53.900 --> 2:49:56.260\n on the United States Supreme Court,\n\n2:49:57.500 --> 2:49:59.740\n what I dislike was the pandering.\n\n2:50:01.260 --> 2:50:06.260\n He was seeking votes from black people by pandering to us\n\n2:50:06.620 --> 2:50:09.020\n and then he's treating us like children.\n\n2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:12.140\n Why should I care what color the person is\n\n2:50:12.140 --> 2:50:14.420\n who's on the United States Supreme Court?\n\n2:50:14.420 --> 2:50:17.700\n What I should care about is what kind of opinions\n\n2:50:17.700 --> 2:50:20.020\n they're gonna write when they're on the United States.\n\n2:50:20.020 --> 2:50:22.020\n Do I suppose that being a black woman\n\n2:50:22.020 --> 2:50:23.460\n means that you're gonna write different kinds\n\n2:50:23.460 --> 2:50:24.340\n of opinions than others?\n\n2:50:24.340 --> 2:50:29.340\n Well, perhaps, perhaps that kind of identity politics\n\n2:50:30.700 --> 2:50:35.140\n at the highest level of American legal establishment\n\n2:50:35.140 --> 2:50:39.140\n is something that rubs me very much the wrong way.\n\n2:50:39.140 --> 2:50:42.740\n What I should care about is the nature\n\n2:50:42.740 --> 2:50:43.780\n and the future of the law.\n\n2:50:43.780 --> 2:50:45.700\n I mean, I'm actually struck by this\n\n2:50:45.700 --> 2:50:49.820\n because the court is conservative.\n\n2:50:50.780 --> 2:50:53.820\n It has six conservative members on it\n\n2:50:53.820 --> 2:50:56.420\n and it has three liberal members on it.\n\n2:50:58.380 --> 2:51:02.700\n And if I were and I'm not a liberal Democrat,\n\n2:51:02.700 --> 2:51:04.900\n the highest concern that I would have\n\n2:51:04.900 --> 2:51:07.540\n about an appointment to the Supreme Court is,\n\n2:51:07.540 --> 2:51:11.060\n is this a person who is going to be effective\n\n2:51:11.060 --> 2:51:14.020\n in advocating my liberal views\n\n2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:17.020\n within the highest counsel of American law?\n\n2:51:17.020 --> 2:51:19.940\n Now, the fact that that person is a woman\n\n2:51:19.940 --> 2:51:23.180\n or is a black person is way down the list\n\n2:51:23.180 --> 2:51:26.340\n of the things that I would think are important\n\n2:51:26.340 --> 2:51:29.660\n to the kinds of opinions that they're going to write.\n\n2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:33.380\n So, I mean, I think Joe Biden,\n\n2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:38.380\n this is just a piece of a larger political strategy\n\n2:51:39.540 --> 2:51:41.660\n to cobble together a coalition\n\n2:51:41.660 --> 2:51:44.020\n that'll be successful at the polls\n\n2:51:44.020 --> 2:51:45.700\n in sustaining Democrats.\n\n2:51:46.740 --> 2:51:49.980\n Jim Crow 2.0, this whole characterization\n\n2:51:49.980 --> 2:51:52.940\n of the conflict in the states\n\n2:51:52.940 --> 2:51:56.180\n about election security and voting rights\n\n2:51:56.180 --> 2:51:58.500\n is another part of that strategy.\n\n2:51:58.500 --> 2:52:01.980\n He is pandering to black voters.\n\n2:52:01.980 --> 2:52:04.980\n He is trying to frighten us,\n\n2:52:04.980 --> 2:52:06.940\n thinking that if the Republicans win,\n\n2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:08.740\n our rights will be taken away.\n\n2:52:09.740 --> 2:52:14.740\n And I think it is a infantilization\n\n2:52:14.860 --> 2:52:16.380\n of African American politics.\n\n2:52:16.380 --> 2:52:20.380\n I think black people are not to be as concerned\n\n2:52:20.380 --> 2:52:22.420\n about the color of the skin of a person\n\n2:52:22.420 --> 2:52:23.980\n who is serving in government\n\n2:52:23.980 --> 2:52:26.940\n as they are about the content of their character\n\n2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:30.700\n and the focus of their political\n\n2:52:30.700 --> 2:52:32.820\n and ideological orientation,\n\n2:52:32.820 --> 2:52:37.380\n which for me would be center or even center right,\n\n2:52:37.380 --> 2:52:38.860\n but that's me.\n\n2:52:38.860 --> 2:52:41.460\n And it should not have a significant impact.\n\n2:52:41.460 --> 2:52:43.940\n Nevertheless, he said she can overcome the asterisks,\n\n2:52:43.940 --> 2:52:46.300\n but to me it was deeply disrespectful\n\n2:52:46.300 --> 2:52:50.380\n that anyone would give an extra asterisk\n\n2:52:50.380 --> 2:52:51.700\n to have to overcome.\n\n2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:52.860\n He didn't have to say it.\n\n2:52:52.860 --> 2:52:54.060\n All he had to do was do it.\n\n2:52:54.060 --> 2:52:55.700\n If he wanted to put a black woman on the court,\n\n2:52:55.700 --> 2:52:57.460\n then he could have gone ahead and done it.\n\n2:52:57.460 --> 2:52:59.780\n The reason he said it is because he wanted black people\n\n2:52:59.780 --> 2:53:01.580\n to vote for him by saying it.\n\n2:53:01.580 --> 2:53:04.540\n And I'm saying that treats us like we're children.\n\n2:53:04.540 --> 2:53:05.780\n It's not a political statement.\n\n2:53:05.780 --> 2:53:06.860\n I just thought as a leader,\n\n2:53:06.860 --> 2:53:11.340\n that was kind of disgusting.\n\n2:53:12.820 --> 2:53:13.900\n Let me ask you about Thomas Sowell.\n\n2:53:13.900 --> 2:53:14.820\n You mentioned him.\n\n2:53:14.820 --> 2:53:18.860\n He's a colleague and somebody who was an influence\n\n2:53:20.980 --> 2:53:22.660\n in the space of ideas.\n\n2:53:22.660 --> 2:53:27.660\n So what broadly, what impact has he had on your ideas\n\n2:53:27.660 --> 2:53:32.660\n and how do you think he shaped the landscape of ideas\n\n2:53:33.020 --> 2:53:35.140\n in our culture in general?\n\n2:53:35.140 --> 2:53:37.540\n I think Thomas Sowell, he's in his 90s now.\n\n2:53:37.540 --> 2:53:39.100\n He's been around for a long time.\n\n2:53:39.100 --> 2:53:40.300\n He's still got it.\n\n2:53:40.300 --> 2:53:41.380\n He's still going at it.\n\n2:53:41.380 --> 2:53:42.220\n He's still going at it.\n\n2:53:42.220 --> 2:53:43.180\n Books continue to come out.\n\n2:53:43.180 --> 2:53:44.420\n I think he's a great man.\n\n2:53:45.340 --> 2:53:49.060\n I think Thomas Sowell, regardless of his race,\n\n2:53:49.060 --> 2:53:54.060\n he's black, is one of the 100 most significant economists\n\n2:53:54.060 --> 2:53:56.180\n of the 20th century.\n\n2:53:56.180 --> 2:53:57.980\n He has chosen as his subject,\n\n2:53:57.980 --> 2:53:59.740\n a substantial part of his subject,\n\n2:53:59.740 --> 2:54:03.220\n subject to investigate the deep causes\n\n2:54:03.220 --> 2:54:07.740\n and consequences of racial disparity of one kind or another.\n\n2:54:07.740 --> 2:54:12.740\n He's written fundamental books about that, many of them.\n\n2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:15.820\n He's a social philosopher.\n\n2:54:15.820 --> 2:54:18.860\n He is a economic historian.\n\n2:54:18.860 --> 2:54:23.860\n He is a combatant in the conflict of ideas\n\n2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:25.940\n around how to think about society\n\n2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:28.420\n and this beyond racial differences,\n\n2:54:28.420 --> 2:54:29.660\n although race has been a big part\n\n2:54:29.660 --> 2:54:31.380\n of what he's written about.\n\n2:54:31.380 --> 2:54:33.580\n He's been critical of affirmative action\n\n2:54:33.580 --> 2:54:36.060\n and he didn't just stand back and wag his finger.\n\n2:54:36.060 --> 2:54:37.980\n He got busy looking at the consequences\n\n2:54:37.980 --> 2:54:40.740\n of affirmative action in societies all around the world.\n\n2:54:40.740 --> 2:54:42.660\n And he's written books about that.\n\n2:54:42.660 --> 2:54:47.180\n He's been critical of the narrative about civil rights\n\n2:54:47.180 --> 2:54:48.780\n and racial inequality.\n\n2:54:48.780 --> 2:54:50.260\n He believes in small government.\n\n2:54:50.260 --> 2:54:54.060\n He doesn't think that efforts to redistribute income\n\n2:54:54.060 --> 2:54:55.860\n have proved to be the solution\n\n2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:58.660\n to the problem of racial disparity.\n\n2:54:58.660 --> 2:55:01.100\n Tom has not been honored by the committee\n\n2:55:01.100 --> 2:55:05.140\n that hands out Nobel recognition in economic science\n\n2:55:05.140 --> 2:55:07.780\n and probably won't be because he's controversial.\n\n2:55:07.780 --> 2:55:12.540\n And I reckon that that committee would be loath to encourage\n\n2:55:12.540 --> 2:55:14.900\n the blowback that they would be sure to receive\n\n2:55:14.900 --> 2:55:17.660\n if they were to take a controversial\n\n2:55:17.660 --> 2:55:22.660\n and politically focus and expressive black conservative\n\n2:55:23.660 --> 2:55:24.860\n and honor in that way.\n\n2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:27.420\n So I think another reason is that Tom\n\n2:55:27.420 --> 2:55:32.420\n as a methodological matter is not especially quantitative.\n\n2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:33.740\n He pays attention to data\n\n2:55:33.740 --> 2:55:36.380\n but he doesn't do statistical analysis\n\n2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:38.340\n and he doesn't do modeling.\n\n2:55:38.340 --> 2:55:40.220\n So from a methodological point of view,\n\n2:55:40.220 --> 2:55:44.180\n he's not a cutting edge kind of person\n\n2:55:44.180 --> 2:55:47.740\n of mathematically sophisticated,\n\n2:55:47.740 --> 2:55:51.700\n kind of quantitatively statistically oriented\n\n2:55:51.700 --> 2:55:53.100\n but he does descriptive stuff.\n\n2:55:53.100 --> 2:55:56.780\n He writes in a style that is much more\n\n2:55:56.780 --> 2:55:59.460\n like a social historian than it is\n\n2:55:59.460 --> 2:56:04.140\n like a mathematically trained analytical economist.\n\n2:56:04.140 --> 2:56:07.380\n On the other hand, he is an economist in the Chicago school\n\n2:56:07.380 --> 2:56:09.940\n with Milton Friedman and George Stickler\n\n2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:14.940\n prominent amongst his teachers who takes price theory\n\n2:56:15.180 --> 2:56:20.180\n which is the analysis of the interplay of market forces,\n\n2:56:21.860 --> 2:56:25.860\n mindful of incentives and so on\n\n2:56:25.860 --> 2:56:30.860\n to implement the basic insights from economic science.\n\n2:56:32.100 --> 2:56:33.100\n There is no free lunch.\n\n2:56:33.100 --> 2:56:34.460\n I mean, there's always gonna be a cost\n\n2:56:34.460 --> 2:56:36.460\n to anything that you do and so on.\n\n2:56:36.460 --> 2:56:40.660\n People respond to incentives, demand curves slope downward.\n\n2:56:40.660 --> 2:56:42.140\n Competition tends to work best\n\n2:56:42.140 --> 2:56:45.060\n when people are free to enter and not and so on.\n\n2:56:45.060 --> 2:56:46.860\n I mean, that kind of thing.\n\n2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:51.780\n But Tom is also a social historian and a philosopher\n\n2:56:51.780 --> 2:56:54.900\n in the tradition of Friedrich von Hayek.\n\n2:56:55.860 --> 2:56:57.820\n One of Tom's books I've deeply admired,\n\n2:56:57.820 --> 2:56:59.980\n \"'Knowledge and Decisions,'\n\n2:56:59.980 --> 2:57:03.060\n is an extension of the Hayekian arguments\n\n2:57:03.060 --> 2:57:08.060\n about the limits of central planning and whatnot.\n\n2:57:09.060 --> 2:57:14.060\n So I think Thomas Sowell, African American,\n\n2:57:15.380 --> 2:57:17.540\n born as I understand it in Louisiana,\n\n2:57:18.500 --> 2:57:22.300\n raised in New York City, graduate of Harvard College,\n\n2:57:22.300 --> 2:57:26.580\n a military veteran, a PhD in economics\n\n2:57:26.580 --> 2:57:29.180\n from the University of Chicago,\n\n2:57:29.180 --> 2:57:31.780\n a black conservative social scientist\n\n2:57:31.780 --> 2:57:34.540\n of very high stature, I think he's a great man.\n\n2:57:34.540 --> 2:57:37.820\n And one of the great intellectuals of the 20th century.\n\n2:57:37.820 --> 2:57:42.820\n And you're saying implicitly deserves a Nobel Prize.\n\n2:57:42.940 --> 2:57:45.500\n Yeah, I do think so.\n\n2:57:45.500 --> 2:57:50.060\n I mean, Hayek was awarded by the committee.\n\n2:57:50.060 --> 2:57:53.180\n Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist\n\n2:57:53.180 --> 2:57:54.460\n who wrote about economic development,\n\n2:57:54.460 --> 2:57:56.460\n wrote a famous two volume work,\n\n2:57:56.460 --> 2:57:59.460\n \"'An American Dilemma,' about the status of blacks.\"\n\n2:57:59.460 --> 2:58:04.460\n I mean, I think Tom could be put in that company\n\n2:58:04.620 --> 2:58:06.100\n very easily without any difficulty.\n\n2:58:06.100 --> 2:58:08.900\n I agree, Daniel Kahneman, them,\n\n2:58:08.900 --> 2:58:09.940\n so it doesn't have to be an American.\n\n2:58:09.940 --> 2:58:14.820\n Psychologist, an economist, Eleonora Ostrom,\n\n2:58:14.820 --> 2:58:17.420\n the political scientist who was honored in a joint prize\n\n2:58:17.420 --> 2:58:21.900\n given to her and Oliver Williamson 15 years ago or so.\n\n2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:24.660\n He could be put in that company really quite easily.\n\n2:58:26.060 --> 2:58:27.860\n Let me ask you, you mentioned Obama\n\n2:58:27.860 --> 2:58:31.100\n in the very beginning that we were talking about.\n\n2:58:34.260 --> 2:58:38.140\n How did it feel, that seems like forever ago,\n\n2:58:38.140 --> 2:58:41.780\n that in 2008, Barack Obama became president?\n\n2:58:41.780 --> 2:58:45.780\n Now at that time, perhaps you identify\n\n2:58:45.780 --> 2:58:47.360\n as conservative already.\n\n2:58:48.940 --> 2:58:53.940\n So politics aside, just in general,\n\n2:58:53.940 --> 2:58:58.940\n how did it feel that in 150 years\n\n2:58:59.860 --> 2:59:01.540\n where this country has come along?\n\n2:59:03.260 --> 2:59:07.340\n Well, yeah, I didn't identify in 2008\n\n2:59:07.340 --> 2:59:10.780\n as a conservative to the same extent that I do today.\n\n2:59:12.420 --> 2:59:15.940\n I was kind of in transition yet again.\n\n2:59:15.940 --> 2:59:18.380\n I was excited by the Obama candidacy.\n\n2:59:18.380 --> 2:59:23.140\n At first I was skeptical because after all, he's not black.\n\n2:59:25.260 --> 2:59:27.460\n The man's father is a Kenyan\n\n2:59:27.460 --> 2:59:31.860\n and the man's mother is a white American\n\n2:59:31.860 --> 2:59:35.060\n and he identifies as black.\n\n2:59:35.060 --> 2:59:38.700\n I find it interesting that the first black president\n\n2:59:38.700 --> 2:59:39.660\n of the United States,\n\n2:59:39.660 --> 2:59:42.460\n and I could have put inverted commas around black,\n\n2:59:42.460 --> 2:59:45.920\n and the first black vice president of the United States,\n\n2:59:45.920 --> 2:59:48.420\n neither of them descend from American slaves.\n\n2:59:49.660 --> 2:59:54.660\n Kamala Harris's father is of African ancestry in part.\n\n2:59:54.740 --> 2:59:56.000\n He's a Jamaican immigrant\n\n2:59:56.000 --> 3:00:00.340\n and her mother is an Indian immigrant.\n\n3:00:00.340 --> 3:00:02.380\n She was Kamala Harris,\n\n3:00:04.180 --> 3:00:07.940\n raised up largely in Canada,\n\n3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:11.360\n though born in the United States.\n\n3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:16.360\n Barack Obama is, as I've said, of mixed ancestry\n\n3:00:17.360 --> 3:00:20.200\n and neither of his parents are the descendants\n\n3:00:20.200 --> 3:00:25.200\n of American descendants of African slaves.\n\n3:00:26.320 --> 3:00:31.000\n But blackness is flexible.\n\n3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:35.460\n It's something that you can put on\n\n3:00:35.460 --> 3:00:38.600\n or you can take off to a certain degree for some people\n\n3:00:38.600 --> 3:00:41.640\n and so be it.\n\n3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:46.640\n I was excited, our time has come, hope and change.\n\n3:00:48.600 --> 3:00:51.160\n We are the ones we've been waiting for.\n\n3:00:51.160 --> 3:00:53.120\n These are slogans from 2008.\n\n3:00:54.680 --> 3:00:57.560\n I can't believe I bought that crap.\n\n3:00:57.560 --> 3:00:58.400\n Oh, interesting.\n\n3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.120\n Let me push back here.\n\n3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:04.140\n You talked about, I mean, to me a Jew is a Jew.\n\n3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:08.000\n Skin color is skin color.\n\n3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:08.840\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:15.160\n I mean, Barack Obama is black when it matters,\n\n3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:20.800\n when you're talking to a white supremacist,\n\n3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:25.320\n when you're talking to, if you're a slave owner,\n\n3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:26.440\n he's black.\n\n3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:30.680\n Just like you said, when Hitler comes around,\n\n3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:31.520\n a Jew is a Jew.\n\n3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:35.800\n It doesn't matter how you identify, it doesn't matter what.\n\n3:01:35.800 --> 3:01:40.240\n So in that sense, don't you think that Barack Obama\n\n3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:43.400\n is black in the most powerful of ways,\n\n3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:48.400\n which is designating how far the MLK, the Dr. King vision?\n\n3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:50.140\n Oh, sure.\n\n3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:52.720\n And look, I said it a little bit tongue in cheek.\n\n3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:54.160\n Yes, yes, of course.\n\n3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:57.160\n But I think Obama has been very careful\n\n3:01:57.160 --> 3:02:00.880\n about manufacturing a kind of public persona\n\n3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:05.880\n that is intended to position him in the most effective way.\n\n3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:10.760\n You mean like every politician?\n\n3:02:10.760 --> 3:02:12.580\n Yeah, like every politician, sure.\n\n3:02:12.580 --> 3:02:17.200\n And that the racial identity piece is an aspect of that.\n\n3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:21.320\n I mean, anything I say here would only be speculation\n\n3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:24.180\n because I have no facts about the personal history\n\n3:02:24.180 --> 3:02:25.020\n of Barack Obama.\n\n3:02:25.020 --> 3:02:27.760\n And I accept Barack Hussein Obama,\n\n3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:30.880\n as Hillary Clinton once said, I take him at his word\n\n3:02:30.880 --> 3:02:33.960\n about whatever she was talking about.\n\n3:02:34.800 --> 3:02:35.840\n Well, was he a Christian?\n\n3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:37.700\n I think is what the question was.\n\n3:02:37.700 --> 3:02:40.880\n And there was some right wing attack on Obama\n\n3:02:40.880 --> 3:02:45.560\n for having been raised for some years in the Philippines\n\n3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:48.440\n and all of that, or Indonesia, I beg your pardon,\n\n3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:51.560\n in Indonesia and his stepfather and all of that.\n\n3:02:51.560 --> 3:02:55.960\n But she took him at his word and I take him at his word\n\n3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:58.120\n about his racial identity.\n\n3:02:58.120 --> 3:02:58.960\n No.\n\n3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:01.680\n But you were captivated by the power of his words\n\n3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:04.360\n and you regret to the degree you were captivated.\n\n3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:06.440\n Well, I mean, I think in retrospect,\n\n3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:09.920\n that whole campaign looks like a pie in the sky\n\n3:03:09.920 --> 3:03:13.140\n kind of fairy tale.\n\n3:03:13.140 --> 3:03:15.760\n We are the ones we've been waiting for.\n\n3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:18.320\n I can't quote exactly that speech that he gave\n\n3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:21.440\n in Grant Park in Chicago when he was announced\n\n3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:23.740\n as the winner of the election.\n\n3:03:23.740 --> 3:03:27.080\n But today is the day that the rise of the ocean\n\n3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:28.880\n stopped words to this effect.\n\n3:03:28.880 --> 3:03:32.800\n I mean, those who doubted that we could do it,\n\n3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:34.240\n that tonight is your answer.\n\n3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:36.960\n This was gonna be a new day, it was gonna be a new regime.\n\n3:03:36.960 --> 3:03:40.100\n Well, it wasn't a new day and it wasn't a new regime.\n\n3:03:40.100 --> 3:03:43.120\n It was American politics more or less as usual.\n\n3:03:43.120 --> 3:03:46.360\n Barack Obama turns out not to be the Messiah.\n\n3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:48.400\n Maybe there should be no surprise in that.\n\n3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:52.640\n Race relations got set back during Obama's tenure.\n\n3:03:53.760 --> 3:03:57.920\n My beef with Obama is that, okay, you're black.\n\n3:03:57.920 --> 3:03:59.600\n You say you're black, you're black.\n\n3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:02.300\n You got elected, now we have a black president.\n\n3:04:02.300 --> 3:04:04.140\n A black president.\n\n3:04:05.380 --> 3:04:07.880\n You can do stuff that nobody else could do.\n\n3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:11.000\n You're a black president.\n\n3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.840\n You could tell the people burning down the city\n\n3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:18.600\n to get their butts back in their houses and to stop it.\n\n3:04:20.480 --> 3:04:23.000\n You could tell the race hustlers,\n\n3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:24.600\n they all shocked into the world.\n\n3:04:26.460 --> 3:04:28.280\n Not only has our time come\n\n3:04:28.280 --> 3:04:30.740\n for those who supported my campaign,\n\n3:04:30.740 --> 3:04:34.760\n your time is over for those who wanna carry on\n\n3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:40.280\n a advocacy rooted in racial grievance.\n\n3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:44.040\n The election of myself to this highest office proves\n\n3:04:44.040 --> 3:04:46.720\n that the institution of this state are legitimate\n\n3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:49.220\n and open to all comers.\n\n3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:55.160\n I think Barack Obama, when the SHIT hit the fan,\n\n3:04:56.480 --> 3:04:58.200\n if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\n\n3:04:58.200 --> 3:05:00.200\n I deeply regret that he said that.\n\n3:05:00.200 --> 3:05:02.460\n He's president of the United States.\n\n3:05:02.460 --> 3:05:06.480\n The color of his skin and the color of Trayvon's skin,\n\n3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:08.080\n the correlation between those two things.\n\n3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:09.440\n If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\n\n3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:12.280\n Now he says, when he said it,\n\n3:05:12.280 --> 3:05:15.680\n he only meant to sympathize with the parents.\n\n3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:18.020\n But in fact, when he said it from the highest office\n\n3:05:18.020 --> 3:05:20.920\n in the land and then sent his attorney general,\n\n3:05:20.920 --> 3:05:24.680\n Eric Holder out to enforce this narrative,\n\n3:05:24.680 --> 3:05:27.480\n he doubled down on a racial narrative\n\n3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:30.000\n that I think is actually false.\n\n3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:35.000\n I think the story that systemic racism in America\n\n3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:38.320\n as reflected in policing that terrorizes black people\n\n3:05:38.320 --> 3:05:42.680\n because of the color of their skin is demonstrably false.\n\n3:05:42.680 --> 3:05:47.360\n I think that the central threat to black lives\n\n3:05:47.360 --> 3:05:52.360\n is violent crime perpetrated largely by black people\n\n3:05:52.820 --> 3:05:54.440\n against other black people.\n\n3:05:54.440 --> 3:05:56.300\n I think there is such a thing as police brutality\n\n3:05:56.300 --> 3:05:58.840\n and I think there are reasons to have regulations of police\n\n3:05:58.840 --> 3:06:02.240\n but I think it is a second order issue\n\n3:06:02.240 --> 3:06:07.000\n in terms of the quality of life of African Americans.\n\n3:06:07.000 --> 3:06:08.820\n I think Obama could have told the people\n\n3:06:08.820 --> 3:06:12.000\n who after Freddie Gray died in police custody\n\n3:06:12.000 --> 3:06:15.300\n in a van in Baltimore and who undertook\n\n3:06:15.300 --> 3:06:19.280\n to burn that city down to get their asses off the street\n\n3:06:19.280 --> 3:06:21.080\n and go back to their apartments and stop it.\n\n3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:22.820\n I think he could have said in the aftermath\n\n3:06:22.820 --> 3:06:26.560\n of Michael Brown being shot dead by Darren Wilson\n\n3:06:26.560 --> 3:06:30.720\n in Ferguson, Missouri and there was a grand jury deliberation\n\n3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:34.040\n that he elected not to indict Officer Wilson\n\n3:06:34.040 --> 3:06:35.680\n and people took the streets in that city\n\n3:06:35.680 --> 3:06:39.240\n and stood on top of vehicles and so forth and so on.\n\n3:06:39.240 --> 3:06:42.980\n He could have told them we don't mob around courthouses\n\n3:06:42.980 --> 3:06:46.000\n in this country, we respect the rule of law,\n\n3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:48.480\n get your butts off the streets\n\n3:06:48.480 --> 3:06:49.840\n and back into your apartments.\n\n3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:50.860\n He didn't do that.\n\n3:06:53.400 --> 3:06:54.680\n To push back a little bit.\n\n3:06:54.680 --> 3:06:56.720\n Yeah, good, push back.\n\n3:06:56.720 --> 3:06:59.620\n I think you're asking Barack Obama,\n\n3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:04.460\n the first black president of the United States,\n\n3:07:04.460 --> 3:07:07.240\n to do the thing that I think should be done\n\n3:07:07.240 --> 3:07:09.720\n by the second black president of the United States.\n\n3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:13.380\n I think his very example, given the color of his skin,\n\n3:07:15.440 --> 3:07:17.480\n was the most powerful thing.\n\n3:07:17.480 --> 3:07:22.360\n And actually doing some of these hard Thomas Sowell type\n\n3:07:22.360 --> 3:07:26.920\n of Glen Lurie type of strong words about race,\n\n3:07:26.920 --> 3:07:29.620\n it may be too much to ask given the nature\n\n3:07:29.620 --> 3:07:31.680\n of modern day politics.\n\n3:07:31.680 --> 3:07:33.260\n He is a politician.\n\n3:07:33.260 --> 3:07:34.100\n He is a politician.\n\n3:07:34.100 --> 3:07:37.000\n And he needed to get elected, he needed to get reelected.\n\n3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:39.640\n It was in his second term\n\n3:07:39.640 --> 3:07:41.340\n where most of what I'm talking about happened,\n\n3:07:41.340 --> 3:07:43.040\n so he wasn't facing further election.\n\n3:07:43.040 --> 3:07:48.040\n But Obama was what, 46 or 47 when he was inaugurated?\n\n3:07:48.680 --> 3:07:52.120\n He served for eight years, so he's in his mid 50s.\n\n3:07:52.120 --> 3:07:54.840\n He's got another half century or 40 years of life,\n\n3:07:54.840 --> 3:07:56.500\n God willing.\n\n3:07:56.500 --> 3:07:58.960\n His post presidency, I think,\n\n3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:00.680\n was what was primarily on his mind.\n\n3:08:00.680 --> 3:08:03.140\n Not getting elected to anything,\n\n3:08:03.140 --> 3:08:05.280\n but being enshrined in a certain way.\n\n3:08:05.280 --> 3:08:10.280\n And the persona that he is now embodying,\n\n3:08:11.280 --> 3:08:14.880\n which depends upon a racial narrative\n\n3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:18.160\n that I and Thomas Sowell and others object to,\n\n3:08:18.160 --> 3:08:21.360\n I think was very much in the forefront of his mind\n\n3:08:21.360 --> 3:08:23.720\n when he made decisions as the chief executive officer\n\n3:08:23.720 --> 3:08:28.720\n of the country that we've all now have to live with.\n\n3:08:28.720 --> 3:08:33.720\n Yeah, but the fact is, he opened the door\n\n3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:35.960\n in a way that hasn't been done\n\n3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:40.680\n in the history of the United States,\n\n3:08:40.680 --> 3:08:45.680\n that I don't see there being even a significant discussion\n\n3:08:47.500 --> 3:08:52.060\n when an African American, a black man or a black woman\n\n3:08:52.060 --> 3:08:54.920\n runs for president, maybe a black man, let's say,\n\n3:08:54.920 --> 3:08:56.960\n because there still hasn't been a woman president.\n\n3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:01.000\n I just see that that broke open the possibility of that.\n\n3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:02.520\n That's not even a discussion.\n\n3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:05.960\n And that example by itself, I mean, to me,\n\n3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:08.760\n the role of the president isn't just policy.\n\n3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:09.780\n It's to inspire.\n\n3:09:09.780 --> 3:09:14.780\n It's to do the Dr. King thing, which is, I have a dream.\n\n3:09:16.760 --> 3:09:19.500\n And Barack Obama is an example of somebody\n\n3:09:19.500 --> 3:09:21.240\n that could give one hell of a speech.\n\n3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:23.840\n It got you to believe.\n\n3:09:23.840 --> 3:09:26.920\n Obama is a smooth operator without any question.\n\n3:09:26.920 --> 3:09:28.440\n He's a master of his craft.\n\n3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:30.800\n He did the impossible.\n\n3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:34.280\n I mean, he beat Hillary Clinton in that primary fight,\n\n3:09:34.280 --> 3:09:38.000\n and he beat John McCain in that general election,\n\n3:09:38.000 --> 3:09:39.120\n and hats off to him.\n\n3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:43.960\n And moreover, he remains a iconic figure in American culture.\n\n3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:46.160\n I don't think there's any doubt about that.\n\n3:09:46.160 --> 3:09:50.120\n Let me just mention, Clarence Thomas is also black.\n\n3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:55.120\n Clarence Thomas has a story that is vivid and inspiring,\n\n3:09:56.300 --> 3:09:57.380\n just like Obama's story.\n\n3:09:57.380 --> 3:10:00.060\n He overcome obstacles just like Obama did.\n\n3:10:00.060 --> 3:10:02.620\n I mean, extreme poverty and so forth and so on.\n\n3:10:02.620 --> 3:10:07.260\n Clarence Thomas has served longer than any other member\n\n3:10:07.260 --> 3:10:09.380\n of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:13.160\n He is one of nine justices,\n\n3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:15.620\n and it's three equal branches of government.\n\n3:10:15.620 --> 3:10:18.340\n So Clarence Thomas, by my arithmetic,\n\n3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:22.520\n personifies 1 27th of the American state.\n\n3:10:25.060 --> 3:10:28.700\n He is an iconic figure.\n\n3:10:28.700 --> 3:10:32.940\n His example should be an inspiration to Americans\n\n3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:36.380\n of all races, but especially a black American youngsters.\n\n3:10:36.380 --> 3:10:38.900\n He happens to be conservative.\n\n3:10:38.900 --> 3:10:40.020\n He's very conservative.\n\n3:10:41.300 --> 3:10:42.460\n So fucking what?\n\n3:10:43.660 --> 3:10:46.520\n He too deserves to be in that pantheon.\n\n3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:50.860\n He is not. By the custodians of American education,\n\n3:10:50.860 --> 3:10:53.220\n Clarence Thomas's name is not on that many schools.\n\n3:10:53.220 --> 3:10:55.300\n Barack Obama's name will be on many of them.\n\n3:10:55.300 --> 3:10:56.560\n I'm not equating them.\n\n3:10:56.560 --> 3:10:57.460\n They're different people.\n\n3:10:57.460 --> 3:10:59.560\n The offices are very different.\n\n3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:01.980\n But the same logic that you just used\n\n3:11:01.980 --> 3:11:07.020\n to extol the significance of Barack Obama's ascendancy\n\n3:11:07.020 --> 3:11:10.260\n could and should be applied to Clarence Thomas,\n\n3:11:10.260 --> 3:11:12.020\n in my opinion.\n\n3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:17.020\n Yes, but it's the office, but also there is a resume\n\n3:11:19.060 --> 3:11:20.580\n and there's accomplishments,\n\n3:11:20.580 --> 3:11:23.620\n but then there is oratory and charisma\n\n3:11:23.620 --> 3:11:25.480\n and a number of Twitter followers.\n\n3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:31.200\n So there's ability to captivate a large number of people.\n\n3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:33.140\n And that's a skill.\n\n3:11:33.140 --> 3:11:35.860\n That's a skill that correlates,\n\n3:11:35.860 --> 3:11:38.740\n but is not directly connected to\n\n3:11:38.740 --> 3:11:40.820\n with how impressive your resume is.\n\n3:11:40.820 --> 3:11:43.180\n I agree, and moreover, the judicial function,\n\n3:11:43.180 --> 3:11:45.460\n the judge doesn't go out and give speeches of that sort\n\n3:11:45.460 --> 3:11:48.300\n because it's exactly antithetical to what he's doing.\n\n3:11:48.300 --> 3:11:50.420\n He's a custodian of the law,\n\n3:11:50.420 --> 3:11:53.660\n and that's not a popular feature,\n\n3:11:53.660 --> 3:11:54.820\n figure in American policy.\n\n3:11:54.820 --> 3:11:57.780\n He doesn't stand for election, and it's a good thing too.\n\n3:11:57.780 --> 3:11:59.740\n So I take that point.\n\n3:11:59.740 --> 3:12:01.140\n Here, I want to say something else, though,\n\n3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:02.340\n that's provocative.\n\n3:12:02.340 --> 3:12:03.740\n The next black president,\n\n3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:05.340\n you say the first black president\n\n3:12:05.340 --> 3:12:06.980\n shouldn't have been the one to do that.\n\n3:12:06.980 --> 3:12:08.540\n The second one should,\n\n3:12:08.540 --> 3:12:10.540\n is more likely than not gonna be a Republican.\n\n3:12:10.540 --> 3:12:12.380\n I'm not, I don't have a particular person in mind.\n\n3:12:12.380 --> 3:12:13.220\n I'm just saying.\n\n3:12:13.220 --> 3:12:16.300\n I agree, I agree, I agree.\n\n3:12:17.420 --> 3:12:19.520\n And that's why it's gonna be super fun.\n\n3:12:20.620 --> 3:12:25.380\n Let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat\n\n3:12:25.380 --> 3:12:27.560\n and give advice to young people.\n\n3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:28.980\n So if you're talking to somebody\n\n3:12:28.980 --> 3:12:31.100\n who's in high school, in college,\n\n3:12:31.100 --> 3:12:34.300\n what advice would you give them about their career,\n\n3:12:34.300 --> 3:12:37.300\n about life in general,\n\n3:12:37.300 --> 3:12:39.340\n how to live a life they can be proud of?\n\n3:12:39.340 --> 3:12:44.180\n Well, I'd say the world is your oyster.\n\n3:12:44.180 --> 3:12:46.020\n I mean, first order of business, you're not a victim.\n\n3:12:46.020 --> 3:12:47.060\n I don't care what color you are.\n\n3:12:47.060 --> 3:12:47.980\n I don't care, you're male, female,\n\n3:12:47.980 --> 3:12:49.460\n you're gay, straight, whatever.\n\n3:12:49.460 --> 3:12:51.280\n The world is your oyster.\n\n3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:52.340\n You are so privileged.\n\n3:12:52.340 --> 3:12:54.060\n You sit here in the United States of America,\n\n3:12:54.060 --> 3:12:55.340\n a free country, a rich country,\n\n3:12:55.340 --> 3:12:56.860\n everything is possible for you.\n\n3:12:56.860 --> 3:12:59.380\n Believe me, you can do anything, okay?\n\n3:13:00.700 --> 3:13:05.700\n Secondly, I would say mastery over the medium\n\n3:13:05.700 --> 3:13:10.700\n in which we're embedded is the key to the future.\n\n3:13:11.780 --> 3:13:15.420\n So get educated, focus, work hard,\n\n3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:21.700\n invest in your future by acquiring the skills that you need\n\n3:13:21.700 --> 3:13:23.980\n to be able to navigate the 21st century.\n\n3:13:25.500 --> 3:13:28.500\n I would say the Chinese are coming\n\n3:13:28.500 --> 3:13:30.340\n and I don't mean anything against China.\n\n3:13:30.340 --> 3:13:32.180\n I just mean to say the world's a small place\n\n3:13:32.180 --> 3:13:34.500\n and it's getting smaller.\n\n3:13:34.500 --> 3:13:39.500\n And you better get moving and you better get moving quickly.\n\n3:13:43.140 --> 3:13:47.340\n I'd say your identity, your coloration, your orientation,\n\n3:13:47.340 --> 3:13:52.340\n your category is not the most important thing about you.\n\n3:13:56.260 --> 3:14:00.940\n So the temptation to limit yourself,\n\n3:14:00.940 --> 3:14:03.120\n I give this speech to my kids.\n\n3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:08.120\n I would say, I quote James Joyce.\n\n3:14:10.780 --> 3:14:15.780\n He has a passage in Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\n\n3:14:16.860 --> 3:14:21.180\n in which he says, do you know what Ireland is?\n\n3:14:22.060 --> 3:14:27.020\n Ireland is an old sow that eats her pharaoh.\n\n3:14:27.020 --> 3:14:28.940\n This is Joyce.\n\n3:14:28.940 --> 3:14:32.700\n He says, Stephan Daedalus is the character\n\n3:14:32.700 --> 3:14:35.300\n that he has in mind in this Chronicle.\n\n3:14:35.300 --> 3:14:39.940\n He says, your ethnic inheritance,\n\n3:14:39.940 --> 3:14:42.040\n he's talking about Irish nationalism,\n\n3:14:43.380 --> 3:14:46.300\n are like nets holding you back.\n\n3:14:46.300 --> 3:14:49.780\n That your challenge is to learn how to turn those nets\n\n3:14:49.780 --> 3:14:54.020\n into wings and thereby to fly, okay?\n\n3:14:54.020 --> 3:14:58.200\n Flying into the open skies of modern society.\n\n3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:02.540\n Don't be your grandfather, don't be your father.\n\n3:15:02.540 --> 3:15:04.400\n Don't wear your things so heavily\n\n3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:06.020\n that it keeps you from being open\n\n3:15:06.020 --> 3:15:08.700\n to everything that's new in the world.\n\n3:15:08.700 --> 3:15:10.540\n Wear it lightly.\n\n3:15:10.540 --> 3:15:12.220\n Yes, everybody comes from somewhere,\n\n3:15:12.220 --> 3:15:14.320\n but it doesn't have to be where you end up.\n\n3:15:15.380 --> 3:15:18.520\n So you're not your father, you're not your grandfather.\n\n3:15:19.540 --> 3:15:24.540\n You are this wonderfully blessed human being\n\n3:15:25.020 --> 3:15:28.380\n in the middle of, going into the middle of the 21st century\n\n3:15:28.380 --> 3:15:33.380\n and don't miss it, don't live blinkeredly,\n\n3:15:34.940 --> 3:15:37.720\n don't live small, live big.\n\n3:15:41.100 --> 3:15:46.100\n Live big and wear your history lightly.\n\n3:15:48.020 --> 3:15:51.300\n Yeah, everybody's got a mother tongue,\n\n3:15:51.300 --> 3:15:54.420\n everybody's got a story, everybody has a people,\n\n3:15:54.420 --> 3:15:56.720\n but the world is a small place.\n\n3:15:56.720 --> 3:16:01.720\n I love that you're quoting an Irishman.\n\n3:16:01.720 --> 3:16:05.760\n One of the greatest writers of the 20th century,\n\n3:16:05.760 --> 3:16:09.240\n a profound one, but an Irishman nevertheless.\n\n3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:14.240\n The levels of humor within that is not lost on me.\n\n3:16:14.480 --> 3:16:16.900\n Let me just mention the great Ralph Ellison,\n\n3:16:16.900 --> 3:16:19.280\n the African American writer, Invisible Man\n\n3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:23.900\n is his masterpiece, embodied this spirit.\n\n3:16:23.900 --> 3:16:26.760\n Okay, we black Americans, we do come from somewhere,\n\n3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:29.800\n that come in from somewhere is from slavery in America,\n\n3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:32.880\n that's our ancestral heritage.\n\n3:16:32.880 --> 3:16:37.320\n But that's not what we are, skin and bone,\n\n3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:40.160\n these are superficial things, the spirit.\n\n3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:41.880\n And if I were a more religious person,\n\n3:16:41.880 --> 3:16:44.200\n I could give a whole disposition about that,\n\n3:16:44.200 --> 3:16:46.300\n but it's the spirit, it's that light that's inside,\n\n3:16:46.300 --> 3:16:48.600\n that's who we are and our challenge\n\n3:16:48.600 --> 3:16:50.640\n is to live in the fullness of it,\n\n3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:53.480\n as opposed to this blinkered thing\n\n3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:55.200\n where we don't look left, we don't look right,\n\n3:16:55.200 --> 3:16:59.960\n we're just fitting within this template that we inherit.\n\n3:16:59.960 --> 3:17:02.760\n That is a travesty, really.\n\n3:17:03.780 --> 3:17:07.400\n Glenn, you've lived an incredible life, a productive one,\n\n3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:11.600\n but just representing some powerful ideas,\n\n3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:15.920\n some powerful ideals, but life comes to an end.\n\n3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:18.440\n Yeah.\n\n3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:20.900\n Do you think about your death?\n\n3:17:20.900 --> 3:17:24.120\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:29.120\n Well, it is a really interesting coincidence\n\n3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:31.680\n that you posed me that question,\n\n3:17:33.080 --> 3:17:35.100\n because I'm coming from a funeral.\n\n3:17:37.560 --> 3:17:42.560\n Today is Sunday, on the preceding Tuesday, five days ago,\n\n3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:48.120\n I was at the funeral of Eugene Wesley Smith,\n\n3:17:48.120 --> 3:17:53.120\n who was my brother in law, he was my sister's husband.\n\n3:17:55.080 --> 3:18:00.080\n My sister, Leonette, passed away in August of 2021.\n\n3:18:01.520 --> 3:18:06.520\n Her husband has died at the age of 68 in April of 2022,\n\n3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:11.060\n and I was at his funeral.\n\n3:18:12.560 --> 3:18:14.140\n He died suddenly of a heart attack\n\n3:18:14.140 --> 3:18:15.660\n that came completely out of the blue.\n\n3:18:15.660 --> 3:18:18.480\n He seemed to be in perfect health.\n\n3:18:18.480 --> 3:18:20.440\n He was a magnificent human being.\n\n3:18:20.440 --> 3:18:24.600\n I could go into the details, but take my word for it.\n\n3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:29.120\n He was a businessman, a steel trader, metals trader.\n\n3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:30.880\n He would buy and sell.\n\n3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:32.740\n He worked mostly from his home office.\n\n3:18:32.740 --> 3:18:35.240\n He had clients, counterparties,\n\n3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:37.540\n people he did business with all over the world.\n\n3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:44.120\n He had three sons, one of whom is in his early 30s,\n\n3:18:44.120 --> 3:18:45.760\n two of whom are in their late 30s.\n\n3:18:45.760 --> 3:18:48.000\n These are my sister's children.\n\n3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:50.480\n She's deceased, now he's deceased.\n\n3:18:50.480 --> 3:18:54.520\n The older two sons are severely developmentally disabled,\n\n3:18:54.520 --> 3:18:57.400\n and although they're in their late 30s,\n\n3:18:57.400 --> 3:18:59.860\n they're not independently viable.\n\n3:18:59.860 --> 3:19:02.000\n They don't function effectively.\n\n3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:03.300\n They have to be cared for.\n\n3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:08.240\n That responsibility has now fallen to the family,\n\n3:19:08.240 --> 3:19:12.680\n but mainly to the surviving son who lives with his wife\n\n3:19:12.680 --> 3:19:14.880\n and his two young children,\n\n3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:17.060\n and has assumed the responsibility.\n\n3:19:17.060 --> 3:19:20.440\n They've cared at home, my sister and her husband, Wesley,\n\n3:19:20.440 --> 3:19:24.960\n Eugene Wesley Smith, cared for their disabled sons at home.\n\n3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:26.680\n They didn't want to see them institutionalized.\n\n3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:29.260\n They had some help from programs at the state\n\n3:19:29.260 --> 3:19:30.400\n and social worker and so on,\n\n3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:32.400\n but they mainly took on the burden\n\n3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:34.540\n of caring for them at home.\n\n3:19:34.540 --> 3:19:36.160\n Anyway, I go on at length here,\n\n3:19:36.160 --> 3:19:38.440\n and I don't know how much of this you will choose\n\n3:19:38.440 --> 3:19:41.240\n to make use of, and it doesn't matter, really.\n\n3:19:41.240 --> 3:19:43.240\n I'm just trying to respond to your question.\n\n3:19:43.240 --> 3:19:47.220\n I was asked to offer some remarks at the funeral,\n\n3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:51.000\n and I offered them.\n\n3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:56.000\n And I spoke well of this great man.\n\n3:19:56.160 --> 3:19:57.040\n He was a great man.\n\n3:19:57.040 --> 3:19:59.040\n He had a straight back.\n\n3:19:59.040 --> 3:20:00.200\n He was a standup guy.\n\n3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:01.680\n He could be counted on.\n\n3:20:01.680 --> 3:20:02.720\n His word was his bond.\n\n3:20:02.720 --> 3:20:04.160\n He had broad shoulders.\n\n3:20:04.160 --> 3:20:06.480\n He carried a lot of people with him,\n\n3:20:06.480 --> 3:20:08.960\n business associates, family members,\n\n3:20:08.960 --> 3:20:10.560\n and so forth and so on.\n\n3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:12.080\n He had a huge heart.\n\n3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:13.960\n He was a giving and kind person.\n\n3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:15.200\n He had a great mind.\n\n3:20:15.200 --> 3:20:18.320\n He was an intellectual, even though as a businessman,\n\n3:20:18.320 --> 3:20:23.320\n much of his day was taken up with the minutia of contracts\n\n3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:27.560\n and the details of the order being delivered\n\n3:20:27.560 --> 3:20:28.440\n and not being delivered,\n\n3:20:28.440 --> 3:20:30.120\n of the quality of the product,\n\n3:20:30.120 --> 3:20:32.080\n of the financing, and so forth and so on.\n\n3:20:32.080 --> 3:20:34.140\n There was still a powerful mind there.\n\n3:20:34.140 --> 3:20:36.560\n Yeah, he was a powerful mind, and he studied.\n\n3:20:36.560 --> 3:20:37.380\n He read books.\n\n3:20:37.380 --> 3:20:38.880\n He was interested in music and art.\n\n3:20:38.880 --> 3:20:42.240\n He was a spiritual seeker,\n\n3:20:43.360 --> 3:20:46.200\n had been ordained as a child minister in his youth,\n\n3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:51.200\n and while he remained a master of the Christian canon,\n\n3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:58.400\n he also explored Eastern religion and other spiritual paths\n\n3:20:58.680 --> 3:21:01.880\n and kind of stood above any particular tradition\n\n3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:03.720\n as a man who believed in God\n\n3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:06.880\n but thought that God manifests himself in many ways\n\n3:21:06.880 --> 3:21:09.400\n to human beings and that there was much to learn\n\n3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:12.020\n from other religious traditions as well.\n\n3:21:12.020 --> 3:21:13.200\n This is Wesley.\n\n3:21:13.200 --> 3:21:14.640\n We called him Wesley by his middle name,\n\n3:21:14.640 --> 3:21:15.800\n Eugene Wesley Smith.\n\n3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:17.000\n May he rest in peace.\n\n3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:18.800\n 68.\n\n3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:20.960\n That's five years younger than I am right now.\n\n3:21:20.960 --> 3:21:23.200\n He dropped dead without any warning.\n\n3:21:23.200 --> 3:21:24.220\n I could, too.\n\n3:21:25.720 --> 3:21:26.920\n So.\n\n3:21:26.920 --> 3:21:29.000\n How did that make you feel?\n\n3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:31.660\n What were the thoughts in your mind leading up to it,\n\n3:21:31.660 --> 3:21:34.400\n having to give that speech in the days that followed?\n\n3:21:34.400 --> 3:21:35.240\n Well, first of all, I wondered,\n\n3:21:35.240 --> 3:21:36.640\n what would I say, what would I say?\n\n3:21:36.640 --> 3:21:38.480\n And, you know, there was no way to prepare,\n\n3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:41.920\n and I decided, you know, I rehearsed in my mind this,\n\n3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:43.800\n you know, he had straight back, he had broad shoulders,\n\n3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:45.680\n he had a big heart, he had a great mind,\n\n3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:49.520\n you know, he had a capacious spirit and whatnot,\n\n3:21:49.520 --> 3:21:52.480\n and I used that as a template for making my remarks.\n\n3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:54.540\n But my main thought was, my God,\n\n3:21:54.540 --> 3:21:57.480\n life is precious and life is fleeting,\n\n3:21:57.480 --> 3:21:59.740\n and death is a part of life.\n\n3:22:00.840 --> 3:22:03.280\n My death is a part of my life.\n\n3:22:03.280 --> 3:22:05.760\n And I thought, you know, well,\n\n3:22:05.760 --> 3:22:07.920\n I want to take better care of myself than I do,\n\n3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:09.940\n you know, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n3:22:09.940 --> 3:22:13.620\n But I also thought, a lot of this is not in my hands at all.\n\n3:22:13.620 --> 3:22:16.840\n I thought, one should have his affairs in order.\n\n3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:18.880\n My brother did not have all of his affairs in order,\n\n3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:21.340\n in the sense that there is a lot of,\n\n3:22:21.340 --> 3:22:22.600\n you know, things are going to probate,\n\n3:22:22.600 --> 3:22:24.360\n there was no will, there's, you know,\n\n3:22:24.360 --> 3:22:26.160\n it's kind of unsettled.\n\n3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:30.280\n I don't want that to happen to my surviving family members.\n\n3:22:30.280 --> 3:22:34.480\n I want to have my affairs such that, should heaven forbid,\n\n3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:37.120\n I fall over one day and don't get up again.\n\n3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:39.860\n People don't have to scramble about\n\n3:22:39.860 --> 3:22:43.440\n how to take care of things from that point forward.\n\n3:22:43.440 --> 3:22:45.400\n But as a human, are you afraid?\n\n3:22:47.280 --> 3:22:48.120\n In your own heart.\n\n3:22:48.120 --> 3:22:48.960\n I'm afraid.\n\n3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:51.280\n Now, I read this wonderful book called The Swerve.\n\n3:22:52.240 --> 3:22:53.840\n It's about Lucretius.\n\n3:22:53.840 --> 3:22:56.620\n It's about the nature of things,\n\n3:22:56.620 --> 3:23:00.360\n which is this great classical work from the Roman period\n\n3:23:01.440 --> 3:23:03.720\n by this guy, Lucretius.\n\n3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:05.540\n And I'm trying to think of the name of the author,\n\n3:23:05.540 --> 3:23:06.600\n but you could look it up.\n\n3:23:06.600 --> 3:23:07.840\n The Swerve is the book.\n\n3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:11.120\n It won like a National Book Award or a Pulitzer Prize.\n\n3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:13.660\n And it's the history of the recovery of this book\n\n3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:20.800\n by one of these Italian, Renaissance Italian people\n\n3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:24.500\n who would go into the monasteries in Central Europe\n\n3:23:24.500 --> 3:23:27.200\n and look through the scrolls and they discover\n\n3:23:27.200 --> 3:23:29.560\n these classical works from antiquity,\n\n3:23:29.560 --> 3:23:31.840\n which had been lost through the dark ages\n\n3:23:31.840 --> 3:23:36.840\n and they republish and read these works.\n\n3:23:36.960 --> 3:23:41.080\n And Lucretius's great work on the nature of things\n\n3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:45.360\n was one of these books, Poggio Broccolini.\n\n3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:47.000\n I don't remember the Italian guy's name,\n\n3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.360\n but this all could be looked up.\n\n3:23:49.360 --> 3:23:51.480\n Yeah, Poggio Broccolini.\n\n3:23:51.480 --> 3:23:56.480\n 15th century and the name of the author\n\n3:23:58.200 --> 3:23:59.880\n is Stephen Greenblatt.\n\n3:23:59.880 --> 3:24:02.400\n Yeah, Stephen Greenblatt, a magnificent book\n\n3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:04.960\n and a terrific story.\n\n3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:09.880\n Anyway, one of Lucretius's points, he was an atheist.\n\n3:24:09.880 --> 3:24:11.640\n I mean, he was a Roman.\n\n3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:15.240\n I mean, he didn't believe in mysticism.\n\n3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:20.240\n And he argued it's irrational to be afraid of death.\n\n3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:21.920\n Why should I fear death?\n\n3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:23.360\n Death is coming to all of us.\n\n3:24:24.520 --> 3:24:27.040\n The point of being afraid, I mean, I'm wasting my time\n\n3:24:27.040 --> 3:24:30.120\n fearing something that I have no ultimate control over.\n\n3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:32.040\n It's irrational to be afraid of death.\n\n3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:38.240\n Yeah, because you can't predict when it happens.\n\n3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:41.480\n You only know that it happens.\n\n3:24:41.480 --> 3:24:43.080\n So why be afraid?\n\n3:24:43.080 --> 3:24:43.920\n How's that?\n\n3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:45.120\n And therefore live every day fully,\n\n3:24:45.120 --> 3:24:49.760\n live every day purposefully, you know,\n\n3:24:49.760 --> 3:24:52.200\n and so on, but these are all just words.\n\n3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:55.040\n You know, I don't wanna die.\n\n3:24:55.040 --> 3:24:55.880\n I wanna live forever.\n\n3:24:55.880 --> 3:24:57.480\n I'm not gonna live forever.\n\n3:24:57.480 --> 3:24:59.680\n I don't wanna suffer.\n\n3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:01.040\n I see people suffering.\n\n3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:04.200\n I saw my late wife, Linda Datcher Lowry,\n\n3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:08.400\n Dr. Linda Datcher Lowry, professor of economics\n\n3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:12.400\n at Tufts University, whom I met in graduate school at MIT,\n\n3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:14.680\n black woman from Baltimore.\n\n3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:17.240\n We married, we raised two sons together.\n\n3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:22.120\n She died at the age of 59 from metastatic breast cancer.\n\n3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:24.280\n And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.\n\n3:25:24.280 --> 3:25:25.440\n And it took a while.\n\n3:25:27.360 --> 3:25:30.360\n And we cared for her at home right up until the very end.\n\n3:25:30.360 --> 3:25:35.000\n She died in our bed with our sons on either side of her.\n\n3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:38.320\n And the dog curled up by the door,\n\n3:25:38.320 --> 3:25:42.080\n the porch door in the bedroom, and she expired.\n\n3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:45.560\n And I watched her suffer and I watched her die.\n\n3:25:45.560 --> 3:25:46.880\n And I don't wanna suffer.\n\n3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:48.360\n Who does?\n\n3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:50.080\n I don't wanna die.\n\n3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:53.120\n I am likely to suffer before I die.\n\n3:25:54.280 --> 3:25:58.040\n I am likely to see my death coming and to lament it.\n\n3:26:00.360 --> 3:26:04.080\n There's a book by Richard John Newhouse, the theologian,\n\n3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:07.280\n called As I Lay Dying,\n\n3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:10.200\n As I Lay Dying, Richard John Newhouse.\n\n3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:15.920\n He had stomach cancer and he thought he was dying.\n\n3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:18.720\n And he wrote this book As I Lay Dying.\n\n3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:22.720\n And then he recovered, he went into remission\n\n3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:24.200\n and he had another couple of years.\n\n3:26:24.200 --> 3:26:27.240\n He thought he was dying and he had another couple of years.\n\n3:26:27.240 --> 3:26:30.800\n And I can remember meeting him at a bookstore\n\n3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:34.200\n in suburban Boston when he was on a tour.\n\n3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:35.920\n He was just a friend of mine,\n\n3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:38.720\n a theologian and a public intellectual.\n\n3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:43.360\n He founded the Institute on Religion and Public Life\n\n3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:45.880\n in New York City, which still exists,\n\n3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:47.760\n Richard John Newhouse.\n\n3:26:47.760 --> 3:26:49.360\n And he's contemplating his own death\n\n3:26:49.360 --> 3:26:51.280\n from the point of view of a Christian minister.\n\n3:26:51.280 --> 3:26:53.280\n He was first a Lutheran pastor\n\n3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:55.840\n and then he converted to Catholicism\n\n3:26:55.840 --> 3:26:58.240\n or as he would have put it, I returned to the church\n\n3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:00.800\n because he thought the Renaissance was over.\n\n3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:03.200\n I mean, I'm sorry, the Reformation,\n\n3:27:03.200 --> 3:27:04.040\n Richard thought was over.\n\n3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:07.960\n He says there's only one church, et cetera.\n\n3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:11.160\n Get into theology stuff here.\n\n3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:14.120\n But I'm saying all that to say,\n\n3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:16.600\n I read that book aloud to my wife, Linda,\n\n3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:17.960\n as she lay dying in that bed.\n\n3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:21.760\n I read that book and it was filled with hope.\n\n3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.320\n I mean, it first acknowledged the dread.\n\n3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:27.760\n Yes, I lie dying.\n\n3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:29.320\n I don't wanna die.\n\n3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:30.680\n I'm a Christian minister.\n\n3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:32.480\n Christ was raised from the dead.\n\n3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:34.120\n I'm supposed to believe in everlasting life\n\n3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:35.640\n but the fact of the matter is this is me\n\n3:27:35.640 --> 3:27:37.600\n and I'm lying here and I'm dying.\n\n3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:39.000\n This is the end of me.\n\n3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:42.160\n How are you gonna do anything other than dread\n\n3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:43.000\n the end of me?\n\n3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:45.520\n So let's acknowledge that I don't wanna die, okay?\n\n3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:47.880\n I'm just gonna tell you that upfront.\n\n3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:52.880\n But that is not the end of,\n\n3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:55.680\n my death is not the end of life.\n\n3:27:55.680 --> 3:27:58.160\n I have lived well and fully.\n\n3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:01.320\n I will go and do my best right up until the end.\n\n3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:04.640\n I will accept what is inevitable\n\n3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:07.000\n and I will hold out this belief.\n\n3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:09.360\n And he's a Christian minister so he holds out this belief.\n\n3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:12.000\n And he knows that the belief is not rational.\n\n3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:16.840\n It's not a reasoned deductive scientific conclusion.\n\n3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:21.440\n It's spiritual in the most fundamental way.\n\n3:28:21.440 --> 3:28:25.000\n It is something that people hold on to and they have hope\n\n3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:26.000\n and he had hope.\n\n3:28:27.080 --> 3:28:29.360\n I don't know if I have that hope.\n\n3:28:29.360 --> 3:28:34.360\n I used to be, but I'm no longer a Christian\n\n3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:39.560\n and I'm no longer a theist really.\n\n3:28:39.560 --> 3:28:42.480\n I'm with Lucretius there.\n\n3:28:42.480 --> 3:28:46.560\n I mean, there's no magic that's going on here.\n\n3:28:46.560 --> 3:28:49.400\n There's no unseen hand behind the scene\n\n3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:51.080\n that's arranging things.\n\n3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:54.000\n What I believe is that when I look at the natural world,\n\n3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:56.520\n I see the evolution of the species\n\n3:28:56.520 --> 3:28:59.760\n and I see the organic development of the planets.\n\n3:28:59.760 --> 3:29:02.480\n I mean, the earth is going to not exist\n\n3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:04.480\n in a finite number of years.\n\n3:29:04.480 --> 3:29:06.280\n I think with a very high probability,\n\n3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:08.480\n the sun is gonna die.\n\n3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:10.520\n It's gonna implode.\n\n3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:13.240\n It's gonna go supernova, whatever is gonna happen.\n\n3:29:13.240 --> 3:29:16.800\n And there's not gonna be any there, there.\n\n3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:19.680\n What's the meaning of life, Glen Lowry?\n\n3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:21.160\n That's the meaning of life.\n\n3:29:21.160 --> 3:29:23.960\n Yeah, let's go, let's go.\n\n3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:25.040\n What's the why?\n\n3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:29.960\n Or is that something economists and social scientists\n\n3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:32.200\n and mathematicians are not equipped to answer?\n\n3:29:33.480 --> 3:29:34.320\n Surely.\n\n3:29:34.320 --> 3:29:38.040\n You know, I think we try to live well and meaningfully\n\n3:29:38.040 --> 3:29:39.640\n within our time.\n\n3:29:39.640 --> 3:29:43.120\n We bond, we reproduce, we try to pass on\n\n3:29:43.120 --> 3:29:48.120\n and we accept our limitations and our mortality.\n\n3:29:48.200 --> 3:29:50.560\n We try to contribute\n\n3:29:53.080 --> 3:29:57.800\n and that's through our children and through our work.\n\n3:30:00.640 --> 3:30:03.640\n And we're in this together, we're not in this alone.\n\n3:30:03.640 --> 3:30:08.400\n We are connected to other people.\n\n3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:11.160\n I get a lot of gratitude out of teaching.\n\n3:30:11.160 --> 3:30:12.080\n I'm a teacher.\n\n3:30:13.160 --> 3:30:16.120\n My students are gonna outlive me.\n\n3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:18.360\n They're gonna have students.\n\n3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:19.760\n I'm a writer.\n\n3:30:19.760 --> 3:30:20.920\n My writing is gonna outlive me.\n\n3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:25.200\n I don't wanna be self important or pretentious here.\n\n3:30:25.200 --> 3:30:27.240\n I doubt that I'm gonna be the James Joyce\n\n3:30:27.240 --> 3:30:29.120\n of the 21st century.\n\n3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:31.520\n They may not be reading my stuff in a hundred years\n\n3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:36.320\n because people will certainly be reading Ulysses\n\n3:30:36.320 --> 3:30:37.400\n in a hundred years.\n\n3:30:38.560 --> 3:30:43.120\n But I try to have an impact on the world that I'm a part of\n\n3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:46.200\n and try to leave a legacy that's dignified.\n\n3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:49.200\n I mean, I could give some flowery words\n\n3:30:49.200 --> 3:30:51.240\n here, truth seeking and whatnot.\n\n3:30:51.240 --> 3:30:52.320\n What about love?\n\n3:30:52.320 --> 3:30:53.160\n Love.\n\n3:30:55.400 --> 3:30:59.520\n What role does love play in this life thing?\n\n3:30:59.520 --> 3:31:00.880\n Love makes the world go round.\n\n3:31:00.880 --> 3:31:03.400\n I mean, without love, I mean, what have we got?\n\n3:31:03.400 --> 3:31:08.400\n I mean, we don't have family and, you know,\n\n3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:16.680\n we certainly have missed out if love is not a central part\n\n3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:18.440\n of our existence.\n\n3:31:18.440 --> 3:31:20.240\n But stop asking me questions like that.\n\n3:31:20.240 --> 3:31:21.840\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:24.320\n Glenn, thank you for doing everything you do,\n\n3:31:24.320 --> 3:31:27.880\n for thinking the way you do, for being fearless and bold.\n\n3:31:27.880 --> 3:31:32.280\n And the Glenn show and your writing and your work\n\n3:31:32.280 --> 3:31:33.320\n and just being who you are.\n\n3:31:33.320 --> 3:31:34.960\n Thank you for being you.\n\n3:31:34.960 --> 3:31:37.080\n And thank you for giving me the huge honor\n\n3:31:37.080 --> 3:31:39.800\n of spending your extremely valuable time with me today.\n\n3:31:39.800 --> 3:31:40.840\n This was awesome.\n\n3:31:40.840 --> 3:31:42.120\n It's been my pleasure, Lex.\n\n3:31:42.120 --> 3:31:45.680\n I mean, really, and it has been like four hours, man.\n\n3:31:45.680 --> 3:31:47.760\n You're wearing me out for me.\n\n3:31:47.760 --> 3:31:49.280\n I love it.\n\n3:31:49.280 --> 3:31:52.000\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Glenn Lowry.\n\n3:31:52.000 --> 3:31:53.320\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:31:53.320 --> 3:31:55.800\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:31:55.800 --> 3:31:57.880\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n3:31:57.880 --> 3:32:00.440\n from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n3:32:00.440 --> 3:32:02.720\n If you can't fly, then run.\n\n3:32:02.720 --> 3:32:05.200\n If you can't run, then walk.\n\n3:32:05.200 --> 3:32:07.640\n If you can't walk, then crawl.\n\n3:32:07.640 --> 3:32:11.480\n But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.\n\n3:32:11.480 --> 3:32:26.760\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
