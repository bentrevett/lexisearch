--> 00:08.160\n in order to say there's nothing good,\n\n00:08.160 --> 00:10.840\n nothing you can hold on to, no one you should revere,\n\n00:10.840 --> 00:13.680\n you've got no heroes, the whole thing comes down,\n\n00:13.680 --> 00:15.960\n who's left standing, oh, we've also got this idea\n\n00:15.960 --> 00:18.720\n from the 20th century still about Marxism,\n\n00:18.720 --> 00:23.720\n and no, no, I will not have the entire landscape\n\n00:23.720 --> 00:30.720\n deracinated, and then the worst ideas tried again.\n\n00:31.280 --> 00:33.800\n The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray,\n\n00:33.800 --> 00:38.160\n author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender, Race, and Identity,\n\n00:38.160 --> 00:41.400\n and his most recent book, The War on the West,\n\n00:41.400 --> 00:44.720\n How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason.\n\n00:44.720 --> 00:48.800\n He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker\n\n00:48.800 --> 00:52.400\n who points out and pushes back against what he sees\n\n00:52.400 --> 00:55.440\n as the madness of our modern world.\n\n00:55.440 --> 00:57.960\n I should note that the use of the word Marxism\n\n00:57.960 --> 01:01.520\n and the West in this conversation refers primarily\n\n01:01.520 --> 01:04.880\n to cultural Marxism and the cultural values\n\n01:04.880 --> 01:07.440\n of Western civilization, respectively.\n\n01:07.440 --> 01:10.360\n This is in contrast to my previous conversation\n\n01:10.360 --> 01:14.120\n with Richard Wolff, where we focused on Marxism\n\n01:14.120 --> 01:16.680\n as primarily a critique of capitalism,\n\n01:16.680 --> 01:19.080\n and thus looking at it through the lens\n\n01:19.080 --> 01:21.920\n of economics and not culture.\n\n01:21.920 --> 01:24.480\n Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite\n\n01:24.480 --> 01:27.000\n of each other with very different perspectives\n\n01:27.000 --> 01:30.640\n on how we build a flourishing civilization together.\n\n01:30.640 --> 01:34.080\n I leave it to you, the listener, to think\n\n01:34.080 --> 01:37.000\n and to decide which is the better way.\n\n01:38.040 --> 01:40.080\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:40.080 --> 01:42.320\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:42.320 --> 01:43.520\n in the description.\n\n01:43.520 --> 01:48.000\n And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:52.120\n You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West,\n\n01:52.120 --> 01:54.560\n which in part says that the values, ideas,\n\n01:54.560 --> 01:57.400\n and history of Western civilization are under attack.\n\n01:57.400 --> 01:59.680\n So let's start with the basics.\n\n01:59.680 --> 02:03.040\n Historically and today, what are the ideas\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:05.120\n that represent Western civilization?\n\n02:05.120 --> 02:07.000\n The good, the bad, the ugly.\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:09.800\n I actually don't get stuck on definitions,\n\n02:09.800 --> 02:11.800\n precisely because, as you know, once you get stuck\n\n02:11.800 --> 02:13.120\n on definitions, there's a possibility\n\n02:13.120 --> 02:13.960\n you'll never get off them.\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:14.800\n Yes.\n\n02:16.600 --> 02:17.560\n I'd say a few things.\n\n02:17.560 --> 02:20.240\n Firstly, obviously the Western tradition\n\n02:20.240 --> 02:22.880\n is a specific tradition, a specific tradition\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:27.040\n of ideas, culture, well known to be, perhaps,\n\n02:27.040 --> 02:29.640\n easily defined by the combination of Athens\n\n02:29.640 --> 02:33.000\n and Jerusalem, the world of the Bible,\n\n02:33.000 --> 02:36.340\n and the world of ancient Greece and, indeed, Rome.\n\n02:38.080 --> 02:41.060\n Effectively, it creates European civilization,\n\n02:41.060 --> 02:44.360\n which itself spawns the rest of the Western civilizations,\n\n02:44.360 --> 02:48.640\n America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and others.\n\n02:48.640 --> 02:49.880\n But these are the main countries\n\n02:49.880 --> 02:52.880\n that we still refer to as the West.\n\n02:52.880 --> 02:54.480\n So there's a specific tradition\n\n02:54.480 --> 02:56.480\n and all the things that come from it.\n\n02:58.080 --> 03:01.620\n My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say,\n\n03:02.560 --> 03:04.060\n you know when you're not in it.\n\n03:05.160 --> 03:08.720\n So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai,\n\n03:08.720 --> 03:10.540\n you know you're not in the West.\n\n03:10.540 --> 03:12.820\n Somewhere else, you know you're not in the West.\n\n03:12.820 --> 03:15.400\n When you're in Tokyo, you're somewhere extraordinary,\n\n03:15.400 --> 03:17.360\n but you know you're not in the West.\n\n03:18.400 --> 03:22.660\n Obviously, there are, let's say, borderline questions,\n\n03:22.660 --> 03:24.440\n like is Russia in the West,\n\n03:25.840 --> 03:28.740\n which I sort of leave open as a question.\n\n03:31.400 --> 03:32.240\n Possibly.\n\n03:32.240 --> 03:34.880\n Well, if you were placed into Moscow blindfolded\n\n03:34.880 --> 03:38.240\n and you woke up and you couldn't hear the language,\n\n03:38.240 --> 03:40.080\n or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like,\n\n03:40.080 --> 03:42.920\n would you guess you were in the West or not?\n\n03:42.920 --> 03:44.600\n I think I was somewhere near it.\n\n03:44.600 --> 03:47.160\n Getting closer.\n\n03:47.160 --> 03:49.560\n I mean, you know, it's also a question, doesn't it,\n\n03:49.560 --> 03:51.080\n whether it's European.\n\n03:51.080 --> 03:53.920\n And I think the answer to that is not really,\n\n03:53.920 --> 03:55.960\n although massively influenced by Europe,\n\n03:55.960 --> 03:59.040\n but, and times wanting to reach towards it,\n\n03:59.040 --> 04:01.120\n at times wanting to stay away,\n\n04:01.120 --> 04:04.760\n but a part of the West, possibly, yes.\n\n04:07.420 --> 04:09.920\n But anyway, it's a very specific tradition.\n\n04:09.920 --> 04:13.920\n It's one of a number of major traditions in the world,\n\n04:13.920 --> 04:16.920\n and because it's hard to define\n\n04:16.920 --> 04:19.400\n doesn't mean it doesn't exist, you know.\n\n04:19.400 --> 04:21.160\n Are there certain characteristics and qualities\n\n04:21.160 --> 04:23.960\n about the values and the ideas that define it?\n\n04:23.960 --> 04:28.120\n Is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure?\n\n04:28.120 --> 04:29.040\n Yes.\n\n04:29.040 --> 04:32.080\n I mean, the rule of law, property owning democracies,\n\n04:32.960 --> 04:35.440\n and much more, I mean, these are, of course,\n\n04:35.440 --> 04:37.820\n things that ended up being developed in America\n\n04:37.820 --> 04:41.080\n and then given back to much of the rest of the West.\n\n04:42.960 --> 04:44.780\n I'd say there are other,\n\n04:46.400 --> 04:48.320\n perhaps more controversial attributes\n\n04:48.320 --> 04:49.300\n I would give to the West.\n\n04:49.300 --> 04:53.180\n One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world,\n\n04:53.180 --> 04:55.880\n which is not shared, of course, by every other culture.\n\n04:57.100 --> 04:59.360\n The late philosopher George Steiner\n\n04:59.360 --> 05:00.980\n who said he could never get out of his head\n\n05:00.980 --> 05:02.880\n the haunting fact that the boats\n\n05:02.880 --> 05:05.760\n only seemed to go out from Europe.\n\n05:05.760 --> 05:10.760\n You know, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists,\n\n05:10.960 --> 05:14.600\n the people who wanted to discover other civilizations,\n\n05:14.600 --> 05:17.220\n and indeed, even resurrect ancient civilizations\n\n05:17.220 --> 05:18.920\n and lost civilizations.\n\n05:18.920 --> 05:21.000\n These were scholars that were always coming from the West\n\n05:21.000 --> 05:22.000\n to discover this elsewhere.\n\n05:22.000 --> 05:25.200\n By contrast, you know, there were never boats\n\n05:25.200 --> 05:27.780\n coming from Egypt to help the Anglo Saxons\n\n05:27.780 --> 05:30.480\n discover the origins of their language and so on.\n\n05:30.480 --> 05:32.840\n So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest\n\n05:32.840 --> 05:33.820\n in the rest of the world,\n\n05:33.820 --> 05:35.620\n which can be said to be a Western.\n\n05:35.620 --> 05:36.940\n Attribute, although it, of course,\n\n05:36.940 --> 05:39.440\n also has, one should immediately preface it,\n\n05:39.440 --> 05:41.760\n some downsides and many criticisms\n\n05:41.760 --> 05:43.320\n that can be made of some of the consequences\n\n05:43.320 --> 05:44.320\n of that interest.\n\n05:45.680 --> 05:48.760\n Because, of course, it's not entirely lacking\n\n05:48.760 --> 05:50.560\n in self interest.\n\n05:50.560 --> 05:53.240\n So it's not just the scholars, it's also.\n\n05:53.240 --> 05:54.100\n The armies.\n\n05:54.100 --> 05:57.640\n The armies, and they're looking to gain access\n\n05:57.640 --> 05:59.680\n and control over resources elsewhere.\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:00.520\n To market.\n\n06:00.520 --> 06:03.720\n And hence the imperial imperative.\n\n06:03.720 --> 06:04.560\n Exactly.\n\n06:04.560 --> 06:06.240\n To conquer, to expand.\n\n06:06.240 --> 06:08.520\n Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing.\n\n06:08.520 --> 06:13.000\n I mean, no civilization, I think, that we know of\n\n06:13.000 --> 06:17.240\n doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors where it can.\n\n06:17.240 --> 06:19.720\n The Western ability to go further faster\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:23.620\n certainly gave an advantage in that regard.\n\n06:23.620 --> 06:26.720\n Do some civilizations get a bit more excited\n\n06:26.720 --> 06:28.440\n by that kind of idea than others?\n\n06:28.440 --> 06:29.440\n Possible.\n\n06:29.440 --> 06:30.280\n It's possible.\n\n06:30.280 --> 06:33.880\n Because you could say it's the Western civilization\n\n06:33.880 --> 06:38.680\n because the technological innovation was more efficient\n\n06:38.680 --> 06:39.520\n at doing that kind of thing.\n\n06:39.520 --> 06:40.360\n Absolutely.\n\n06:40.360 --> 06:41.880\n But maybe it wanted it more, too.\n\n06:41.880 --> 06:44.800\n Well, the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot\n\n06:44.800 --> 06:48.160\n and did very terribly well for many centuries,\n\n06:48.160 --> 06:52.120\n and one shouldn't forget that, as did others.\n\n06:53.560 --> 06:55.160\n I'd also say, by the way, and again,\n\n06:55.160 --> 06:57.200\n it's a very broad one, but it's worth throwing out there.\n\n06:57.200 --> 07:02.200\n I think self criticism is an important attribute\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:05.680\n of the Western mind, one that, as you know,\n\n07:05.680 --> 07:07.840\n is not common everywhere.\n\n07:07.840 --> 07:11.560\n Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics\n\n07:11.560 --> 07:13.000\n to become rich.\n\n07:13.000 --> 07:15.980\n So criticism is a negative sounding word.\n\n07:15.980 --> 07:19.400\n It could be self introspection, self analysis,\n\n07:19.400 --> 07:20.680\n self reflection.\n\n07:20.680 --> 07:22.160\n And it can be what you need.\n\n07:23.960 --> 07:26.760\n And in the Western system, I'd argue that one of the\n\n07:26.760 --> 07:30.080\n advantages of the system of representative governance\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:32.600\n is that where there are problems in the system,\n\n07:32.600 --> 07:36.740\n you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means.\n\n07:38.560 --> 07:41.240\n We listen to arguments, most famously in America\n\n07:41.240 --> 07:44.360\n in the late 20th century, the civil rights movement\n\n07:44.360 --> 07:48.060\n achieved its aims by force of moral argument\n\n07:48.060 --> 07:49.440\n and dissuaded the rest of the country\n\n07:49.440 --> 07:50.800\n that it had been wrong.\n\n07:51.920 --> 07:55.840\n That's not common in every society by any means.\n\n07:55.840 --> 07:58.640\n So I think there are certain attributes of the Western mind\n\n07:58.640 --> 08:03.280\n that you could say are, they're not entirely unique,\n\n08:03.280 --> 08:06.540\n but they are not as commonplace elsewhere.\n\n08:06.540 --> 08:10.340\n What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry\n\n08:10.340 --> 08:15.340\n of power, most visible, most drastic in the form of slavery,\n\n08:16.560 --> 08:18.080\n for example?\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:19.920\n Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery,\n\n08:19.920 --> 08:22.160\n so I don't regard it as being a Western,\n\n08:22.160 --> 08:23.640\n a unique Western sin.\n\n08:25.080 --> 08:27.560\n It's rather hard to think of a civilization in history\n\n08:27.560 --> 08:29.360\n that didn't have slavery of some kind.\n\n08:29.360 --> 08:32.520\n One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day\n\n08:32.520 --> 08:35.360\n is that people seem to imagine that our societies\n\n08:35.360 --> 08:37.040\n in the West were the only ones who ever engaged\n\n08:37.040 --> 08:39.000\n in any vices.\n\n08:39.000 --> 08:40.480\n Alas, this isn't true.\n\n08:40.480 --> 08:43.000\n It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake,\n\n08:43.000 --> 08:45.640\n or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau,\n\n08:45.640 --> 08:47.980\n that everybody else in the world was born\n\n08:47.980 --> 08:49.480\n into sort of Edenic innocence,\n\n08:49.480 --> 08:52.720\n and only we in the West had this sort of evil in us\n\n08:52.720 --> 08:55.880\n that caused us to do bad things to other people.\n\n08:55.880 --> 08:58.280\n Slavery was engaged in by everyone in the ancient world,\n\n08:58.280 --> 09:01.760\n of course, and through most of the modern world as well.\n\n09:01.760 --> 09:04.520\n Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today,\n\n09:04.520 --> 09:07.540\n so it's clearly not something that the species as a whole\n\n09:07.540 --> 09:08.600\n has a problem with.\n\n09:09.880 --> 09:11.200\n And that's more slaves, of course,\n\n09:11.200 --> 09:13.000\n than there were in the 19th century.\n\n09:14.040 --> 09:17.840\n And I'd say, on top of that, that the interesting thing\n\n09:17.840 --> 09:19.960\n about the Western mind as regards to slavery\n\n09:19.960 --> 09:23.560\n is that we were the civilization that did away with it.\n\n09:23.560 --> 09:26.280\n And by the way, the founding fathers of America,\n\n09:26.280 --> 09:30.800\n who today are lambasted routinely\n\n09:30.800 --> 09:34.460\n for being acquiescent in the slave trade,\n\n09:35.360 --> 09:37.800\n engaging in it, owning slaves.\n\n09:40.040 --> 09:43.520\n People almost don't even bother now to recognize the facts\n\n09:43.520 --> 09:46.740\n that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington,\n\n09:46.740 --> 09:49.360\n all wanted to see this trade done away with,\n\n09:49.360 --> 09:51.340\n couldn't hold the country together at the origins\n\n09:51.340 --> 09:53.280\n if they'd have made such an effort.\n\n09:53.280 --> 09:55.680\n And believed and hoped that it would be something\n\n09:55.680 --> 09:58.780\n that would be dealt with after their time.\n\n09:58.780 --> 10:03.080\n So the founding ideas had within them the notion\n\n10:03.080 --> 10:05.880\n that we should, as a people, get rid of this.\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:08.480\n The opening lines of the Declaration of Independence\n\n10:08.480 --> 10:12.560\n set up the conditions under which slavery\n\n10:12.560 --> 10:14.600\n will be impossible.\n\n10:14.600 --> 10:16.720\n All men are created equal.\n\n10:16.720 --> 10:19.680\n Once you've put that, that's a time bomb\n\n10:19.680 --> 10:22.660\n under the whole concept of slavery.\n\n10:22.660 --> 10:24.840\n That's ticking away, okay.\n\n10:24.840 --> 10:28.360\n And sure enough, it detonated in the next century.\n\n10:28.360 --> 10:32.640\n If we just step back and look at the human species,\n\n10:32.640 --> 10:36.360\n what does slavery teach you about human nature?\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:41.360\n The fact that slavery has appeared\n\n10:41.720 --> 10:44.360\n as a function of society throughout human history.\n\n10:44.360 --> 10:45.760\n There are two possibilities.\n\n10:47.420 --> 10:51.520\n One is it's what people think they can do\n\n10:51.520 --> 10:52.880\n when God's not watching.\n\n10:54.680 --> 10:56.320\n Another is it's what they can do\n\n10:56.320 --> 10:57.960\n if they think that God allows it.\n\n11:00.000 --> 11:02.080\n Really, really well put.\n\n11:02.080 --> 11:07.080\n And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation,\n\n11:09.280 --> 11:10.880\n what does that mean?\n\n11:10.880 --> 11:13.380\n Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way.\n\n11:14.480 --> 11:17.080\n There are people who get to work for free.\n\n11:17.080 --> 11:19.360\n It's economic in nature in some sense.\n\n11:19.360 --> 11:20.960\n Yes, but in order to do it,\n\n11:20.960 --> 11:24.320\n I mean, almost always there are some examples\n\n11:24.320 --> 11:25.780\n in the ancient world where this wasn't the case,\n\n11:25.780 --> 11:28.120\n but almost always it had to be a subjugated people\n\n11:28.120 --> 11:30.560\n or people that are regarded as different.\n\n11:30.560 --> 11:32.800\n One of the things actually I've tried to sort of inject\n\n11:32.800 --> 11:35.960\n into the discussion through this book among other things\n\n11:35.960 --> 11:40.680\n is a recognition that there were very major questions\n\n11:40.680 --> 11:43.400\n still going on in the 18th and early 19th century\n\n11:43.400 --> 11:46.920\n that were unresolved, which were one of the reasons\n\n11:46.920 --> 11:50.200\n why slavery was not as morally repugnant\n\n11:50.200 --> 11:53.640\n to people then as it is to us now.\n\n11:53.640 --> 11:56.740\n And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis.\n\n11:58.120 --> 11:59.800\n At the time of Thomas Jefferson,\n\n11:59.800 --> 12:03.040\n the founding fathers were thinking and working.\n\n12:03.040 --> 12:06.880\n They didn't know because nobody knew\n\n12:06.880 --> 12:09.160\n whether the human races were related or not.\n\n12:12.880 --> 12:15.880\n There were arguments, the monogenesis argument\n\n12:15.880 --> 12:20.460\n that we were all indeed from the same racial stock.\n\n12:20.460 --> 12:23.520\n Polygenesis argument was that we weren't.\n\n12:23.520 --> 12:26.040\n Black Africans, Ethiopians,\n\n12:26.040 --> 12:27.960\n they're often referred to at the time\n\n12:28.960 --> 12:30.840\n because they provided some of the first slaves,\n\n12:30.840 --> 12:33.040\n were different from white Europeans,\n\n12:33.040 --> 12:35.560\n simply not related in any way.\n\n12:35.560 --> 12:37.280\n And that makes it easier, of course.\n\n12:37.280 --> 12:38.860\n That makes it easier to enslave people\n\n12:38.860 --> 12:41.200\n if you think they're not your brother.\n\n12:41.200 --> 12:42.200\n Am I my brother's keeper?\n\n12:42.200 --> 12:47.200\n No, he's not your brother, and it's a very,\n\n12:51.440 --> 12:54.440\n it was a very troubling argument in the 18th, 19th century,\n\n12:54.440 --> 12:56.200\n also because there was a biblical question.\n\n12:56.200 --> 12:59.680\n It threw up a theological question, which was,\n\n12:59.680 --> 13:03.600\n I mean, people were literally debating this at the time.\n\n13:05.040 --> 13:07.200\n Was there also a black Adam and Eve?\n\n13:08.560 --> 13:11.220\n Was there, as it were, an Indian Adam and Eve,\n\n13:11.220 --> 13:12.820\n a Native American Adam and Eve?\n\n13:14.200 --> 13:17.120\n This was a serious theological debate\n\n13:17.120 --> 13:19.260\n because they didn't know the answer.\n\n13:19.260 --> 13:22.920\n People say that Darwin solved this.\n\n13:22.920 --> 13:25.240\n It wasn't just Darwin, of course,\n\n13:25.240 --> 13:28.360\n but by the late 19th century,\n\n13:28.360 --> 13:32.360\n the argument that we were not all related\n\n13:32.360 --> 13:35.000\n as human beings had suffered so many blows\n\n13:35.000 --> 13:38.880\n that you had to really be very, very ignorant,\n\n13:38.880 --> 13:41.380\n deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then.\n\n13:41.380 --> 13:45.080\n So it no longer was, after Darwin, a theological question.\n\n13:45.080 --> 13:46.800\n It became a moral question.\n\n13:46.800 --> 13:49.160\n It was already a moral question, but it clarified,\n\n13:49.160 --> 13:51.140\n Darwin clarifies it definitely,\n\n13:51.140 --> 13:53.440\n and then you're in this, as I say, in this situation\n\n13:53.440 --> 13:55.880\n of you're not subjugating some other people.\n\n13:55.880 --> 13:58.720\n You're subjugating your own kin,\n\n13:58.720 --> 14:02.260\n and that becomes morally unsustainable.\n\n14:03.400 --> 14:07.840\n So given that slavery in America\n\n14:07.840 --> 14:11.380\n is part of its history,\n\n14:14.160 --> 14:19.160\n how do we incorporate into the calculus of policy today,\n\n14:21.360 --> 14:26.160\n social discourse, what we learn in school?\n\n14:26.160 --> 14:27.560\n We can look at slavery in America.\n\n14:27.560 --> 14:30.760\n We can look at maybe more recent things,\n\n14:30.760 --> 14:35.120\n like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust.\n\n14:35.120 --> 14:39.240\n How do we incorporate that in terms of\n\n14:39.240 --> 14:41.200\n how we create policy, how we treat each other,\n\n14:41.200 --> 14:43.120\n all those kinds of things?\n\n14:43.120 --> 14:47.200\n What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities,\n\n14:47.200 --> 14:51.600\n the injustices of the past into the way we are today?\n\n14:51.600 --> 14:52.980\n That's a very complex question,\n\n14:52.980 --> 14:55.420\n because it's a moral question at this point,\n\n14:56.300 --> 14:58.820\n and a moral question long after the fact.\n\n15:01.520 --> 15:02.880\n I say at one point in the War on the West\n\n15:02.880 --> 15:05.760\n that the argument, for instance, on reparations now\n\n15:05.760 --> 15:09.000\n that goes on, and it's not a fringe argument anymore.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:10.960\n Some people say, oh, you're pulling up this fringe argument.\n\n15:10.960 --> 15:11.800\n It really isn't.\n\n15:11.800 --> 15:14.720\n I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination\n\n15:14.720 --> 15:18.200\n for the presidency in 2020 was willing to talk\n\n15:18.200 --> 15:20.400\n about the possibility of reparations.\n\n15:20.400 --> 15:24.160\n Some very eager that this country, America,\n\n15:24.160 --> 15:28.400\n goes through that entirely self destructive exercise.\n\n15:28.400 --> 15:33.360\n I say that there's a lot of problems with this,\n\n15:33.360 --> 15:36.680\n but if I could refine it down to one thing, I'd say this.\n\n15:36.680 --> 15:38.600\n It's no longer about a wealth transfer\n\n15:38.600 --> 15:40.480\n from one group of people who did something wrong\n\n15:40.480 --> 15:42.760\n to another group of people who were wronged.\n\n15:42.760 --> 15:44.720\n It would have been that, could have been that\n\n15:44.720 --> 15:46.480\n 200 years ago.\n\n15:46.480 --> 15:48.840\n Today, it's not even the descendants of people\n\n15:48.840 --> 15:50.600\n who did something wrong giving money to people\n\n15:50.600 --> 15:53.560\n who were the descendants of people who were wronged.\n\n15:53.560 --> 15:56.680\n It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people\n\n15:56.680 --> 15:59.080\n who did a wrong thing in the past to another group\n\n15:59.080 --> 16:01.680\n of people who resemble people who were wronged.\n\n16:02.920 --> 16:06.440\n That's impossible to do, and I'm completely clear\n\n16:06.440 --> 16:07.600\n about this.\n\n16:07.600 --> 16:11.400\n There is no way in which you could organize\n\n16:11.400 --> 16:16.400\n such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons.\n\n16:17.160 --> 16:21.520\n America is filled with people who have the same skin color\n\n16:21.520 --> 16:23.920\n as us, for instance, who have no connection\n\n16:23.920 --> 16:27.520\n to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money\n\n16:27.520 --> 16:30.600\n to people who have some connection.\n\n16:30.600 --> 16:34.200\n And then the country's also filled with ethnic minorities\n\n16:34.200 --> 16:39.240\n who have come after slavery who would not be due\n\n16:39.240 --> 16:41.840\n for any reimbursement, as it were.\n\n16:42.760 --> 16:46.520\n The problem with this is, though, is that there are,\n\n16:46.520 --> 16:48.160\n I'm perfectly open to the possibility\n\n16:48.160 --> 16:51.520\n that there are residual inequities\n\n16:51.520 --> 16:53.680\n that exist in American life\n\n16:53.680 --> 16:56.280\n and that the consequences of slavery\n\n16:56.280 --> 17:00.160\n could be one of the factors that result from this.\n\n17:01.520 --> 17:06.520\n The thing is, I don't think it's a single issue answer.\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:10.400\n I think it's a multidimensional issue,\n\n17:10.400 --> 17:12.560\n something like black underachievement in America.\n\n17:12.560 --> 17:14.560\n It's obviously a multidimensional issue.\n\n17:16.000 --> 17:20.320\n Much of the left and others wish to say it's not.\n\n17:20.320 --> 17:22.360\n It's only about racism.\n\n17:22.360 --> 17:26.200\n And they can't answer why Asians who've arrived\n\n17:26.200 --> 17:28.120\n more recently don't, for instance,\n\n17:28.120 --> 17:30.520\n get held down by white supremacy.\n\n17:30.520 --> 17:34.840\n But actually, I say white supremacy in quotes, obviously.\n\n17:34.840 --> 17:37.520\n But don't get held back by it, but actually flourish\n\n17:37.520 --> 17:39.760\n to the extent that Asian Americans\n\n17:39.760 --> 17:41.760\n have higher household earnings\n\n17:41.760 --> 17:44.240\n and higher household mean equity than,\n\n17:47.720 --> 17:50.600\n home equity and so on, than white Americans.\n\n17:50.600 --> 17:53.920\n So I don't think that on the merits the evidence is there\n\n17:53.920 --> 17:56.760\n that racism is the explanation for black,\n\n17:56.760 --> 17:59.280\n ongoing black underachievement in some sections\n\n17:59.280 --> 18:01.280\n of the black community in America.\n\n18:01.280 --> 18:03.000\n It's obviously a part of it.\n\n18:03.000 --> 18:07.120\n Could you say that even those things like fatherlessness\n\n18:07.120 --> 18:11.640\n and similar family breakdown issues\n\n18:12.720 --> 18:14.920\n are a longterm consequence of it?\n\n18:16.520 --> 18:19.840\n Possibly, but it's being often said\n\n18:19.840 --> 18:23.040\n it's being awfully generous to people's ability\n\n18:23.040 --> 18:24.880\n to make bad decisions.\n\n18:24.880 --> 18:27.560\n For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust\n\n18:27.560 --> 18:30.600\n would you allow people to claim that everything\n\n18:30.600 --> 18:33.040\n that went wrong in the Jewish community\n\n18:33.040 --> 18:35.440\n was as a result of the Holocaust?\n\n18:35.440 --> 18:39.120\n I mean, is there some kind of term limit on this?\n\n18:39.120 --> 18:40.720\n I would have thought so.\n\n18:40.720 --> 18:43.560\n And I think most people probably think that's over.\n\n18:43.560 --> 18:50.560\n I think the details matter there, but it's very difficult.\n\n18:50.560 --> 18:52.440\n You're in deep waters, yeah.\n\n18:52.440 --> 18:54.360\n Oh, I enjoy swimming out in the ocean,\n\n18:54.360 --> 18:58.440\n so although I'm terrified of what's lurking\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:00.240\n underneath in the darkness.\n\n19:00.240 --> 19:02.240\n You're right, you're right to be.\n\n19:04.480 --> 19:07.400\n Okay, it's really complicated calculus\n\n19:07.400 --> 19:09.960\n with the Holocaust and with slavery.\n\n19:09.960 --> 19:14.960\n So the argument in America is that there's deep\n\n19:15.960 --> 19:20.320\n institutional racism against African Americans\n\n19:20.320 --> 19:22.040\n that's rooted in slavery.\n\n19:22.960 --> 19:27.960\n And so however that calculus turns out,\n\n19:28.080 --> 19:31.400\n that calculation, it still persists in the culture,\n\n19:31.400 --> 19:35.120\n in the institutions, in the allocation of resources,\n\n19:35.120 --> 19:39.200\n in the way that we communicate, in subtle ways,\n\n19:39.200 --> 19:41.880\n in major ways, all that kind of stuff.\n\n19:41.880 --> 19:46.080\n How is it possible to win or lose that argument\n\n19:46.080 --> 19:48.120\n of how much institutional racism there is\n\n19:48.120 --> 19:50.840\n that's rooted in slavery?\n\n19:50.840 --> 19:52.120\n Is it a winnable?\n\n19:52.120 --> 19:53.880\n It's an unquantifiable argument.\n\n19:55.160 --> 19:58.880\n And I'd like to apply some shortcuts\n\n19:58.880 --> 20:00.560\n to some of this, the following.\n\n20:01.920 --> 20:06.640\n Are, for instance, all, let's take the EVV1\n\n20:06.640 --> 20:09.080\n that's most often cited.\n\n20:09.080 --> 20:12.000\n If a white person is walking down a street in America\n\n20:12.000 --> 20:13.800\n and they see a group of young black men\n\n20:13.800 --> 20:15.520\n coming towards them and it's late at night\n\n20:15.520 --> 20:18.160\n and they cross the road, is it because of slavery?\n\n20:20.320 --> 20:22.320\n Is it because of institutional racism?\n\n20:23.400 --> 20:26.080\n No, it's because they've made a calculus\n\n20:26.080 --> 20:31.080\n based not entirely on unfounded beliefs\n\n20:34.080 --> 20:38.320\n that given crime rates, it's possible\n\n20:38.320 --> 20:41.560\n that this group of people might be a group of people\n\n20:41.560 --> 20:43.640\n they don't want to meet late at night.\n\n20:43.640 --> 20:48.640\n That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics\n\n20:48.640 --> 20:51.080\n in American cities after American cities bear out,\n\n20:52.360 --> 20:55.120\n it's not an entirely unreasonable one.\n\n20:55.120 --> 20:59.360\n It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously.\n\n20:59.360 --> 21:01.640\n But is it attributable to slavery?\n\n21:02.920 --> 21:04.040\n That's a stretch.\n\n21:04.040 --> 21:07.920\n If you're in a city like Chicago\n\n21:07.920 --> 21:12.920\n where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years,\n\n21:13.080 --> 21:16.160\n albeit again, as always has to be remembered,\n\n21:16.160 --> 21:21.160\n mainly black on black gun violence and knife violence.\n\n21:21.400 --> 21:23.920\n Nevertheless, if you're in a city like Chicago\n\n21:23.920 --> 21:26.640\n and you make that calculus I've just suggested,\n\n21:26.640 --> 21:30.120\n the cliched one, the street late at night,\n\n21:31.080 --> 21:33.280\n there are other factors other than that.\n\n21:33.280 --> 21:37.080\n Factors other than a memory of slavery that kick in.\n\n21:39.920 --> 21:42.840\n And I'm afraid it's something which people\n\n21:42.840 --> 21:44.560\n don't want to particularly acknowledge in America\n\n21:44.560 --> 21:45.960\n for obvious reasons, because it's the ugliest\n\n21:45.960 --> 21:47.680\n damn debate in the world.\n\n21:47.680 --> 21:49.720\n But I was actually just writing in my column\n\n21:49.720 --> 21:53.360\n in New York Post today about a very interesting case\n\n21:53.360 --> 21:56.200\n that's sort of similar, which is the question\n\n21:56.200 --> 21:58.680\n of obesity in the US.\n\n21:58.680 --> 22:02.040\n As you know, America's the most overweight country\n\n22:02.040 --> 22:03.640\n in the world.\n\n22:03.640 --> 22:08.640\n America has, I think, 40% of the population is obese\n\n22:08.760 --> 22:11.320\n in medical ways, and the nearest next country\n\n22:11.320 --> 22:13.080\n is a long way down, that's New Zealand,\n\n22:13.080 --> 22:14.440\n at 30% of the population.\n\n22:14.440 --> 22:16.240\n So America's a long way ahead.\n\n22:16.240 --> 22:18.880\n Why during the coronavirus era when we know\n\n22:18.880 --> 22:23.480\n that obesity is the one clearest factor\n\n22:23.480 --> 22:25.080\n that's likely to lead to your hospitalization\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:26.720\n if you also get the virus?\n\n22:26.720 --> 22:29.080\n Why did almost no public health information\n\n22:29.080 --> 22:31.120\n in America focus on obesity?\n\n22:31.120 --> 22:33.440\n 80% of the people who ended up hospitalized\n\n22:33.440 --> 22:36.840\n in America with coronavirus were obese.\n\n22:38.000 --> 22:41.120\n We locked the schools when there was no evidence\n\n22:41.120 --> 22:43.680\n that the coronavirus was deadly for children.\n\n22:43.680 --> 22:45.800\n We all wore cloth masks when there was\n\n22:45.800 --> 22:49.240\n a very little evidence that this was much use\n\n22:49.240 --> 22:51.120\n in stopping the spread of the virus.\n\n22:52.200 --> 22:55.160\n We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem,\n\n22:55.160 --> 22:56.440\n and we never addressed it.\n\n22:56.440 --> 22:57.280\n Why?\n\n22:57.280 --> 22:58.960\n Is it just because we worried about fat people?\n\n22:58.960 --> 23:01.800\n No, it's actually because about fat shaming, as it were.\n\n23:01.800 --> 23:03.520\n No, it's also because to a great extent\n\n23:03.520 --> 23:05.520\n it's a racial issue in America as well.\n\n23:05.520 --> 23:07.640\n And actually I quoted this new publication\n\n23:07.640 --> 23:10.200\n from the University of Chicago, as it happens,\n\n23:10.200 --> 23:12.080\n which makes that claim explicit, says,\n\n23:12.080 --> 23:15.440\n the reasons why people have views that are negative\n\n23:15.440 --> 23:18.600\n about obesity is because of racism and slavery.\n\n23:18.600 --> 23:21.200\n This is what everything is drawn back to in America.\n\n23:21.200 --> 23:24.480\n Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of racism,\n\n23:24.480 --> 23:25.760\n it's because of slavery.\n\n23:25.760 --> 23:30.760\n How about it's actually because you mind\n\n23:31.080 --> 23:32.480\n the hospitals getting clogged up,\n\n23:32.480 --> 23:34.280\n you mind people dying,\n\n23:34.280 --> 23:37.880\n you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying,\n\n23:37.880 --> 23:39.200\n and you'd like to say something about it.\n\n23:39.200 --> 23:41.000\n Once again, as in everything in America,\n\n23:41.000 --> 23:46.000\n it's cut off by some poorly educated academic\n\n23:46.320 --> 23:48.640\n saying it's about slavery.\n\n23:48.640 --> 23:51.520\n So we're really not, I mean, this requires\n\n23:51.520 --> 23:54.320\n a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society,\n\n23:54.320 --> 23:57.320\n probably one that's not possible without killing the patient.\n\n23:57.320 --> 24:02.320\n And it's being done by people who are wearing mittens.\n\n24:04.880 --> 24:09.600\n So I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this\n\n24:09.600 --> 24:12.200\n that are rolling their eyes and saying,\n\n24:12.200 --> 24:16.960\n here we go again, two white guys talking about\n\n24:16.960 --> 24:20.820\n the lack of institutional racism in America.\n\n24:20.820 --> 24:25.820\n First of all, what would you like to tell them?\n\n24:27.760 --> 24:31.980\n So our African American friends who are looking at this,\n\n24:31.980 --> 24:34.500\n and I've gotten the chance to talk to a bunch of them\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:35.820\n on Clubhouse recently.\n\n24:35.820 --> 24:37.220\n Clubhouse is this social app.\n\n24:37.220 --> 24:38.700\n And I really enjoy it.\n\n24:38.700 --> 24:41.220\n It's an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see it.\n\n24:41.220 --> 24:44.540\n I personally love it because you get to talk to,\n\n24:44.540 --> 24:48.020\n as somebody who's an introvert and doesn't socialize much,\n\n24:48.020 --> 24:52.100\n I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life.\n\n24:52.100 --> 24:55.020\n So it gave me a chance to first of all practice\n\n24:55.020 --> 24:58.320\n Russian and Ukrainian, so I get the chance to do that.\n\n24:58.320 --> 25:00.580\n Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine\n\n25:00.580 --> 25:04.980\n with people who are from that part of the world.\n\n25:04.980 --> 25:09.980\n And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground\n\n25:10.180 --> 25:14.040\n where they start screaming, they start crying,\n\n25:14.040 --> 25:16.940\n they start being calm and collected and thoughtful.\n\n25:16.940 --> 25:20.460\n And this is as if you walked into a bar\n\n25:20.460 --> 25:24.940\n with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks.\n\n25:24.940 --> 25:29.180\n Just people that have, quote unquote, lived experiences.\n\n25:29.180 --> 25:34.020\n Real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases,\n\n25:34.020 --> 25:36.100\n and you get to listen to them go at it.\n\n25:36.100 --> 25:39.700\n With no, because it's an audio app,\n\n25:39.700 --> 25:41.460\n you're not allowed to start getting\n\n25:41.460 --> 25:43.580\n into a physical fist fight.\n\n25:43.580 --> 25:46.260\n So even though it really sounds like people want it.\n\n25:46.260 --> 25:47.580\n It sounds like it's happening, yeah.\n\n25:47.580 --> 25:50.180\n Yeah, and so you get to really listen to that feeling.\n\n25:50.180 --> 25:53.500\n And for example, it allows a white guy like me\n\n25:53.500 --> 25:55.380\n from another part of the world,\n\n25:55.380 --> 25:58.320\n coming from the former Soviet Union,\n\n25:58.320 --> 26:03.320\n to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans\n\n26:03.500 --> 26:07.720\n screaming about Joe Rogan using the N word.\n\n26:07.720 --> 26:09.100\n And I get to really listen.\n\n26:09.100 --> 26:11.420\n There's very different perspectives on that\n\n26:11.420 --> 26:13.180\n in the African American community,\n\n26:13.180 --> 26:14.620\n and it's fascinating to listen.\n\n26:14.620 --> 26:19.000\n So I don't get access to that by excellent books\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.420\n and articles written and so on.\n\n26:20.420 --> 26:22.300\n You get that real raw emotion.\n\n26:22.300 --> 26:24.460\n And I'm just saying, there's a few of those folks\n\n26:24.460 --> 26:27.700\n listening to this with that real raw emotion.\n\n26:27.700 --> 26:32.700\n And one argument they say is you, Douglas Murray,\n\n26:32.940 --> 26:35.260\n and you, Lex Freeman, don't have the right\n\n26:36.180 --> 26:38.780\n to talk about race and racism in America.\n\n26:38.780 --> 26:40.580\n It is our struggle.\n\n26:40.580 --> 26:42.540\n You are from a privileged class of people\n\n26:42.540 --> 26:47.540\n that don't know what it's like to be a black man\n\n26:48.140 --> 26:51.140\n or woman in America walking down the street.\n\n26:51.140 --> 26:52.920\n Can you steel man that case?\n\n26:54.500 --> 26:55.780\n First of all, fuck that.\n\n26:56.740 --> 27:01.120\n That's not, I think we need to define steel, steel manning.\n\n27:01.120 --> 27:03.940\n Okay, I know what steel manning is.\n\n27:04.940 --> 27:07.340\n I really resent that form of argumentation.\n\n27:07.340 --> 27:08.180\n Sure.\n\n27:08.180 --> 27:09.300\n I really resent it.\n\n27:09.300 --> 27:11.800\n I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want,\n\n27:11.800 --> 27:14.700\n and no one's gonna stop me or try to intimidate me\n\n27:14.700 --> 27:18.100\n or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color.\n\n27:18.100 --> 27:20.140\n And I think that if I said to somebody else\n\n27:20.140 --> 27:23.340\n the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible.\n\n27:23.340 --> 27:25.540\n If I said, shut up, you have no right\n\n27:25.540 --> 27:27.420\n to criticize anything that Douglas Murray says\n\n27:27.420 --> 27:29.940\n because you've not got my skin color.\n\n27:29.940 --> 27:33.140\n Okay, it's not an exact comparison, but seriously,\n\n27:33.140 --> 27:36.360\n is that a reasonable form of argument?\n\n27:36.360 --> 27:37.500\n You haven't been through everything\n\n27:37.500 --> 27:39.900\n I've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment.\n\n27:39.900 --> 27:43.640\n No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything.\n\n27:43.640 --> 27:47.260\n We might as well pack up, go home, and isolate ourselves.\n\n27:47.260 --> 27:49.980\n Strong words, but can you try to steel man the case,\n\n27:49.980 --> 27:51.320\n not in this particular situation,\n\n27:51.320 --> 27:56.060\n but there's people that have lived through something\n\n27:57.200 --> 27:59.100\n that can comment in a very specific way,\n\n27:59.100 --> 28:00.860\n like for example, Holocaust survivors.\n\n28:00.860 --> 28:01.700\n Yes.\n\n28:03.180 --> 28:07.660\n There is a sense in which, maybe a basic sense of civility\n\n28:07.660 --> 28:10.140\n when a Holocaust survivor is speaking about\n\n28:10.140 --> 28:12.240\n their experience of the Holocaust,\n\n28:12.240 --> 28:17.220\n then an intellectual from a very different part of the world\n\n28:17.220 --> 28:22.220\n is simply writing about nuanced geopolitics of World War II\n\n28:23.040 --> 28:26.780\n just should not interrupt the Holocaust survivor.\n\n28:26.780 --> 28:27.940\n We physically interrupt them\n\n28:27.940 --> 28:28.780\n if they're telling their stories.\n\n28:28.780 --> 28:32.060\n No, with words, with logic and reason\n\n28:32.060 --> 28:34.340\n that the experience of the Holocaust survivor\n\n28:34.340 --> 28:38.220\n somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding\n\n28:38.220 --> 28:42.220\n of the humanity and the injustice of the.\n\n28:42.220 --> 28:45.100\n First of all, again, we're in even deeper waters now,\n\n28:45.100 --> 28:48.460\n but in terms of wanting to listen to another person\n\n28:48.460 --> 28:52.700\n who has experienced something, yes, yes.\n\n28:52.700 --> 28:56.540\n But not endlessly, not endlessly.\n\n28:56.540 --> 28:58.340\n I mean, there are some people who've written about,\n\n28:58.340 --> 29:00.060\n I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust\n\n29:00.060 --> 29:02.300\n who didn't experience the Holocaust\n\n29:02.300 --> 29:04.940\n and have written about it better than people who did.\n\n29:05.900 --> 29:09.840\n It's not this idea that the lived experience\n\n29:09.840 --> 29:12.260\n to use this terrible modern jargon\n\n29:12.260 --> 29:14.060\n as if there's another type.\n\n29:14.060 --> 29:16.340\n This idea that the lived experience\n\n29:16.340 --> 29:20.680\n has to triumph over everything else is not always correct.\n\n29:20.680 --> 29:23.720\n It can be correct in some circumstances.\n\n29:23.720 --> 29:26.260\n If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor\n\n29:26.260 --> 29:28.620\n and somebody who'd never heard about the Holocaust\n\n29:28.620 --> 29:32.620\n and wanted to kind of shoot out their views on it, yeah,\n\n29:32.620 --> 29:34.740\n one of those people should be heard more than the other,\n\n29:34.740 --> 29:36.280\n obviously, obviously.\n\n29:37.260 --> 29:40.060\n If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand\n\n29:40.060 --> 29:42.980\n and there's somebody else who has never experienced it,\n\n29:42.980 --> 29:45.340\n then obviously you'd want to hear from the person\n\n29:45.340 --> 29:47.540\n who has experienced it firsthand,\n\n29:47.540 --> 29:49.740\n if that is the discussion underway.\n\n29:51.980 --> 29:53.900\n I don't think that it's the case\n\n29:53.900 --> 29:55.980\n that that is endlessly the case.\n\n29:55.980 --> 29:59.660\n I'm also highly reluctant to concede\n\n29:59.660 --> 30:00.940\n that there are groups of people\n\n30:00.940 --> 30:05.220\n who by dint of their skin color or anything else\n\n30:05.220 --> 30:07.100\n get to dominate the microphone.\n\n30:07.100 --> 30:08.340\n Now, of course, we're literally both speaking\n\n30:08.340 --> 30:10.660\n to microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this,\n\n30:10.660 --> 30:12.620\n but let's skate over the irony.\n\n30:13.980 --> 30:15.620\n What I mean is people saying,\n\n30:15.620 --> 30:17.620\n you don't have the right to speak,\n\n30:17.620 --> 30:19.700\n I have the right to take the microphone from you\n\n30:19.700 --> 30:22.180\n and speak because I know best.\n\n30:22.180 --> 30:26.340\n Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out\n\n30:26.340 --> 30:29.100\n and someone will win, long or short term.\n\n30:30.460 --> 30:35.460\n But the almost aggressive tone\n\n30:36.100 --> 30:39.500\n in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of,\n\n30:40.380 --> 30:43.660\n nobody's experience is completely understandable\n\n30:43.660 --> 30:46.580\n by another human being, nobody's.\n\n30:46.580 --> 30:49.300\n And what many people are asking us to do at the moment,\n\n30:49.300 --> 30:52.500\n us collectively is, to fall for that thing,\n\n30:52.500 --> 30:54.780\n I think it was Camille Foster who said it first,\n\n30:54.780 --> 30:57.260\n but I've adopted in recent years,\n\n30:57.260 --> 31:00.540\n is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life\n\n31:00.540 --> 31:03.420\n trying to understand me personally,\n\n31:03.420 --> 31:06.340\n my lived experience, everything about me.\n\n31:06.340 --> 31:10.540\n You should dedicate your life to trying to do that.\n\n31:10.540 --> 31:13.580\n Simultaneously, you'll never understand me.\n\n31:15.060 --> 31:17.180\n This is not an attractive invitation.\n\n31:17.180 --> 31:20.860\n This is an unwinnable game.\n\n31:20.860 --> 31:24.860\n So if somebody has a legitimate\n\n31:26.580 --> 31:29.580\n and important point to make, they should make it\n\n31:29.580 --> 31:31.220\n and they'll win through whatever their character is\n\n31:31.220 --> 31:32.060\n or whatever their race.\n\n31:32.060 --> 31:33.780\n And by the way, there are plenty of white people\n\n31:33.780 --> 31:35.620\n who experience racism as well.\n\n31:35.620 --> 31:38.980\n There are plenty of white people who do and have done,\n\n31:38.980 --> 31:40.980\n and increasingly so, which is one of the things\n\n31:40.980 --> 31:42.740\n I write about in the War on the West.\n\n31:42.740 --> 31:45.740\n I mean, I would argue that today in America,\n\n31:45.740 --> 31:47.340\n the only group who are actually allowed\n\n31:47.340 --> 31:52.020\n to be consistently, vilely racist against the white people.\n\n31:52.020 --> 31:54.660\n If you say disgusting things about black people\n\n31:54.660 --> 31:57.500\n in America in 2022, you will be over.\n\n31:58.500 --> 31:59.980\n You will be over.\n\n31:59.980 --> 32:02.980\n If you decide to talk about people's white tears,\n\n32:02.980 --> 32:05.980\n their white female tears, their white guilt,\n\n32:05.980 --> 32:08.580\n their white privilege, their white rage,\n\n32:08.580 --> 32:11.980\n and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms,\n\n32:11.980 --> 32:12.900\n you'll be just fine.\n\n32:12.900 --> 32:14.260\n You can be the chairman of the Joint Committee\n\n32:14.260 --> 32:16.980\n of the Staff, you can lecture at Yale University,\n\n32:16.980 --> 32:20.500\n absolutely fine, and the white people have to suck that up\n\n32:20.500 --> 32:23.300\n as if that's fine because there was racism\n\n32:23.300 --> 32:24.620\n in another direction in the past.\n\n32:24.620 --> 32:27.180\n So white people can have racism as well.\n\n32:27.180 --> 32:28.940\n Does that mean that I think that I have a right\n\n32:28.940 --> 32:31.340\n or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse\n\n32:31.340 --> 32:34.780\n by talking about their feelings of having been victims\n\n32:34.780 --> 32:35.780\n of racism?\n\n32:35.780 --> 32:38.060\n No, not particularly, because what does that get us?\n\n32:38.060 --> 32:41.860\n It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimhood.\n\n32:41.860 --> 32:44.860\n Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence\n\n32:44.860 --> 32:48.100\n have experienced historically anything like the violence\n\n32:48.100 --> 32:49.780\n that was perpetrated against black people\n\n32:49.780 --> 32:51.180\n in America historically?\n\n32:51.180 --> 32:52.540\n Obviously not.\n\n32:52.540 --> 32:57.540\n But what kind of competition do we want to enter here?\n\n32:58.780 --> 33:03.300\n And this is very, very important terrain now in America,\n\n33:03.300 --> 33:05.220\n because there's one other thing I have to throw in there,\n\n33:05.220 --> 33:09.220\n which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim?\n\n33:09.220 --> 33:12.540\n How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made?\n\n33:12.540 --> 33:14.980\n At one point in this latest book,\n\n33:14.980 --> 33:19.060\n I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche\n\n33:19.060 --> 33:20.660\n on the genealogy of morals,\n\n33:21.660 --> 33:24.380\n where, as you know, Nietzsche always has to be treated\n\n33:24.380 --> 33:26.340\n carefully, you know, when people say,\n\n33:26.340 --> 33:29.460\n I love Nietzsche, you have to say, which bits?\n\n33:29.460 --> 33:33.820\n So what exactly do you love about him?\n\n33:34.820 --> 33:35.660\n But,\n\n33:35.660 --> 33:38.660\n and a lot can be learned from the answer.\n\n33:38.660 --> 33:40.980\n But there are moments in Genealogy of Morals\n\n33:40.980 --> 33:42.980\n that were very useful for this book.\n\n33:42.980 --> 33:45.900\n One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase\n\n33:45.900 --> 33:48.260\n that I've now stolen from myself, appropriated,\n\n33:48.260 --> 33:49.100\n you might say,\n\n33:50.540 --> 33:55.540\n where he refers to people who tear at wounds\n\n33:55.540 --> 33:59.540\n long since closed and then cry about the pain they feel.\n\n33:59.540 --> 34:01.020\n And Nietzsche says,\n\n34:01.020 --> 34:03.900\n I've never felt so much pain in my life\n\n34:03.900 --> 34:05.820\n as the pain they feel.\n\n34:08.140 --> 34:10.900\n Now, how do you know,\n\n34:10.900 --> 34:13.380\n how do you know whether the pain is real?\n\n34:14.500 --> 34:15.940\n How do you know?\n\n34:15.940 --> 34:20.780\n I'm not saying you can never know, but it's hard.\n\n34:20.780 --> 34:22.180\n So when somebody says,\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:24.180\n I feel that my life hasn't gone that well\n\n34:24.180 --> 34:25.700\n and it's because of something that was done\n\n34:25.700 --> 34:28.300\n to my ancestors 200 years ago,\n\n34:28.300 --> 34:30.380\n maybe they do feel that.\n\n34:30.380 --> 34:32.660\n Maybe they're right to feel that.\n\n34:32.660 --> 34:34.580\n Maybe they're using it up.\n\n34:34.580 --> 34:37.980\n Maybe they're using it as their reason for failure in life.\n\n34:37.980 --> 34:41.500\n Maybe they're using it as their reason to not even try.\n\n34:41.500 --> 34:42.780\n Maybe they're using it as their reason\n\n34:42.780 --> 34:45.620\n to smoke weed all day.\n\n34:45.620 --> 34:46.900\n I don't know.\n\n34:46.900 --> 34:47.740\n And who does know?\n\n34:47.740 --> 34:49.620\n How can you work that out?\n\n34:49.620 --> 34:51.420\n And that's why I come back to this thing of,\n\n34:51.420 --> 34:55.180\n who are we to constantly judge in this society\n\n34:55.180 --> 34:57.620\n other people who we don't know\n\n34:57.620 --> 35:01.620\n and attribute motives to them based on racial\n\n35:01.620 --> 35:02.660\n characteristics?\n\n35:03.860 --> 35:05.580\n And as you write in this part,\n\n35:07.140 --> 35:10.700\n I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche\n\n35:11.900 --> 35:14.900\n and at the same time, canceling Nietzsche\n\n35:16.260 --> 35:17.820\n in the same set of sentences.\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:20.500\n But you write in this part about evil.\n\n35:20.500 --> 35:22.580\n No, I didn't cancel Nietzsche.\n\n35:22.580 --> 35:23.420\n Well.\n\n35:23.420 --> 35:27.100\n Can't cancel Nietzsche, I was saying treat him carefully.\n\n35:27.100 --> 35:29.660\n Treat him carefully, fair enough.\n\n35:29.660 --> 35:31.820\n But you can judge a man's character\n\n35:31.820 --> 35:35.060\n by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes.\n\n35:35.060 --> 35:36.540\n That's fair enough, I think.\n\n35:36.540 --> 35:38.540\n I think when you meet people who do man and Superman\n\n35:38.540 --> 35:39.860\n a bit too much, you're in.\n\n35:42.140 --> 35:45.300\n Now you're pulling in even deeper water\n\n35:45.300 --> 35:47.100\n referencing Hitler here.\n\n35:47.100 --> 35:48.460\n Okay.\n\n35:48.460 --> 35:51.100\n So you write in this part of the book about evil.\n\n35:53.220 --> 35:57.260\n Quote, what is it that drives evil?\n\n35:57.260 --> 35:58.500\n Many things without doubt,\n\n35:58.500 --> 36:00.580\n but one of them is identified by several\n\n36:00.580 --> 36:04.420\n of the great philosophers is resentment.\n\n36:04.420 --> 36:06.580\n That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers\n\n36:06.580 --> 36:09.420\n for people who want to destroy.\n\n36:09.420 --> 36:12.180\n Colon, blaming someone else for having something\n\n36:12.180 --> 36:14.180\n you believe you deserve more.\n\n36:14.180 --> 36:17.500\n And you're saying this kind of resentment,\n\n36:17.500 --> 36:21.180\n we don't know as it surfaces whether it's genuine\n\n36:21.180 --> 36:25.740\n or if it's used to sort of play games of power\n\n36:25.740 --> 36:30.740\n to evil ends, can you speak to this?\n\n36:32.460 --> 36:34.740\n Because it's such a fascinating idea\n\n36:34.740 --> 36:37.980\n that one of the biggest drivers of evil\n\n36:37.980 --> 36:41.420\n in the world is resentment.\n\n36:41.420 --> 36:43.940\n Because if you look at, boy,\n\n36:43.940 --> 36:47.300\n if you look at human history, if you look at Hitler,\n\n36:47.300 --> 36:49.700\n so much of the propaganda, so much of the narrative\n\n36:49.700 --> 36:51.100\n was about resentment.\n\n36:52.100 --> 36:54.020\n So is that surface or is it level\n\n36:54.020 --> 36:56.180\n or is that deep, the resentment that drives evil?\n\n36:56.180 --> 36:58.180\n It can be any of the above.\n\n36:58.180 --> 37:01.580\n Let's first of all preface it, everybody has resentment.\n\n37:01.580 --> 37:06.140\n I use the term resentment which is sort of very similar\n\n37:06.140 --> 37:08.260\n to resentment, let's stick with resentment.\n\n37:09.540 --> 37:11.260\n So we don't sound too pretentious.\n\n37:17.460 --> 37:18.780\n Let me give you a quick example of somebody\n\n37:18.780 --> 37:21.780\n in our own day who has a form of resentment,\n\n37:21.780 --> 37:22.660\n Vladimir Putin.\n\n37:22.660 --> 37:26.420\n Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace?\n\n37:26.420 --> 37:27.260\n Yes.\n\n37:27.260 --> 37:28.100\n Yeah.\n\n37:28.100 --> 37:29.780\n You remember the stuff about Putin\n\n37:29.780 --> 37:32.780\n as a young KGB officer in Germany?\n\n37:32.780 --> 37:34.740\n Remember the stuff about Putin and his first wife's\n\n37:34.740 --> 37:37.020\n resentment of one of his KGB colleagues\n\n37:37.020 --> 37:40.100\n who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger\n\n37:40.100 --> 37:41.900\n than the Putin's apartment?\n\n37:42.900 --> 37:43.740\n Yeah.\n\n37:43.740 --> 37:44.820\n It's very interesting.\n\n37:44.820 --> 37:47.220\n And by the way, I'm not saying that, you know,\n\n37:47.220 --> 37:48.820\n Vladimir Putin became the man he has become\n\n37:48.820 --> 37:50.820\n and invaded Ukraine because he didn't have an apartment\n\n37:50.820 --> 37:53.420\n he liked in Berlin or Munich or wherever he was.\n\n37:53.420 --> 37:55.180\n There's distinct possibility.\n\n37:55.180 --> 38:00.180\n My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives\n\n38:02.220 --> 38:05.140\n and we all feel it in our lives\n\n38:05.140 --> 38:08.380\n and it's something that has to be struggled against.\n\n38:09.380 --> 38:13.020\n Resentment is, in political terms, can be a deadly,\n\n38:13.020 --> 38:15.660\n I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing to draw upon.\n\n38:16.860 --> 38:18.060\n I mean, you mentioned Hitler.\n\n38:18.060 --> 38:20.060\n Obviously one of the things that Hitler\n\n38:20.060 --> 38:22.980\n played on was resentment, obviously.\n\n38:24.540 --> 38:27.060\n Almost every revolutionary does.\n\n38:27.060 --> 38:28.980\n I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well.\n\n38:28.980 --> 38:30.620\n And not without cause.\n\n38:31.620 --> 38:33.900\n It's a good reason to feel that Versailles\n\n38:33.900 --> 38:38.020\n was not listening to Paris in the 1780s\n\n38:38.020 --> 38:41.700\n and feel resentment for Marie Antoinette\n\n38:41.700 --> 38:44.220\n in her palace within the palace,\n\n38:44.220 --> 38:47.380\n ignoring the bread shortages in Paris.\n\n38:47.380 --> 38:51.380\n So resentment is a very, it's a very understandable thing\n\n38:51.380 --> 38:53.180\n and sometimes it's justifiable\n\n38:53.180 --> 38:57.300\n and it's also deadly to the person as it is to the society.\n\n38:57.300 --> 38:59.980\n It's an incredibly deep, deep sentiment.\n\n38:59.980 --> 39:03.260\n Somebody else has got something that you should have.\n\n39:04.460 --> 39:07.540\n And the problem about it is that it has the potential\n\n39:07.540 --> 39:08.460\n to be endless.\n\n39:09.460 --> 39:11.460\n You can do it your whole life.\n\n39:11.460 --> 39:14.540\n And one of the ways I've sort of found myself\n\n39:14.540 --> 39:15.860\n explaining this to people is to say,\n\n39:15.860 --> 39:18.180\n it's also important to recognize that resentment\n\n39:18.180 --> 39:21.180\n is something that can cross absolutely every boundary.\n\n39:22.060 --> 39:26.420\n So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries, obviously,\n\n39:26.420 --> 39:28.180\n and how it goes without saying.\n\n39:28.180 --> 39:30.660\n More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries\n\n39:30.660 --> 39:32.420\n and socioeconomic boundaries.\n\n39:33.380 --> 39:36.060\n And if I was to sort of simplify this thought,\n\n39:36.060 --> 39:39.500\n I would say, I guess that you and I\n\n39:39.500 --> 39:44.500\n and everybody watching knows or has known something\n\n39:44.500 --> 39:47.820\n or has known somebody in their lives\n\n39:47.820 --> 39:52.820\n who has almost nothing in worldly terms\n\n39:53.540 --> 39:57.020\n and is a generous person, a kindly person,\n\n39:57.020 --> 40:02.020\n a giving person, a happy person even, a cheerful person.\n\n40:03.300 --> 40:06.460\n And I think we probably have also,\n\n40:06.460 --> 40:07.900\n or many of us will have met people\n\n40:07.900 --> 40:09.300\n who seem to have everything\n\n40:09.300 --> 40:13.300\n and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment.\n\n40:13.300 --> 40:14.940\n Somebody else has held them back from something.\n\n40:14.940 --> 40:16.580\n Their sister once did something,\n\n40:16.580 --> 40:19.860\n she got this and I should have got that.\n\n40:19.860 --> 40:22.020\n And on and on and on.\n\n40:22.020 --> 40:23.660\n It's a human trait.\n\n40:23.660 --> 40:26.780\n And one of the things that suggests to me\n\n40:26.780 --> 40:29.340\n is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this.\n\n40:29.340 --> 40:32.020\n And this is something which we can do something about,\n\n40:32.020 --> 40:35.900\n not limitlessly, but for instance,\n\n40:35.900 --> 40:37.700\n I mean, there are very good reasons\n\n40:37.700 --> 40:41.060\n that some people in their lives might feel resentment.\n\n40:41.060 --> 40:44.020\n Let's say you're involved in a car crash\n\n40:44.020 --> 40:46.500\n and a friend fell asleep at the wheel\n\n40:46.500 --> 40:48.700\n and that's why you are spending the rest of your life\n\n40:48.700 --> 40:50.100\n in a wheelchair.\n\n40:50.100 --> 40:51.420\n It's a pertinent example of this\n\n40:51.420 --> 40:53.260\n in American politics at the moment.\n\n40:55.500 --> 40:58.100\n You would be justified in feeling resentment.\n\n40:58.980 --> 41:01.020\n And at some point you have to make a decision,\n\n41:01.020 --> 41:08.020\n which is, am I going to be that person or a different person?\n\n41:08.020 --> 41:10.500\n But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level\n\n41:10.500 --> 41:13.180\n and at the societal level is destructive to the mind,\n\n41:13.180 --> 41:15.500\n even when you're, quote unquote, justified.\n\n41:15.500 --> 41:16.820\n It rots you.\n\n41:16.820 --> 41:21.340\n It rots you because the best you can do\n\n41:21.340 --> 41:25.100\n is to eke out your days unfulfilled.\n\n41:26.540 --> 41:29.460\n So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude.\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:31.100\n Yes.\n\n41:31.100 --> 41:35.660\n Gratitude is the antidote to evil in a sense.\n\n41:35.660 --> 41:38.340\n Gratitude is the individual level and the societal level.\n\n41:38.340 --> 41:40.700\n Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment.\n\n41:41.700 --> 41:44.700\n I quote in The War on the West,\n\n41:44.700 --> 41:46.940\n when I read it the first time a few years ago,\n\n41:46.940 --> 41:51.220\n I was absolutely floored by the brothers Karamazov.\n\n41:52.420 --> 41:53.460\n Not everything in it, by the way,\n\n41:53.460 --> 41:54.500\n and I won't get into it,\n\n41:54.500 --> 41:58.060\n but I have some very big structural criticisms\n\n41:58.060 --> 41:59.620\n of the novel.\n\n41:59.620 --> 42:01.500\n Now you're just sweet talking to me\n\n42:01.500 --> 42:04.860\n because I'm a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this.\n\n42:04.860 --> 42:06.220\n Oh, okay.\n\n42:06.220 --> 42:07.660\n Well, we could get into what I see\n\n42:07.660 --> 42:09.500\n as being the structural flaws in the brothers Karamazov,\n\n42:09.500 --> 42:10.340\n but anyway.\n\n42:10.340 --> 42:12.220\n Now I'm offended and triggered.\n\n42:12.220 --> 42:17.020\n Yeah, no, I mean, this is something coming out of Macbeth\n\n42:17.020 --> 42:19.060\n and saying, I didn't think it was much good.\n\n42:19.060 --> 42:20.740\n Yeah, there's structural flaws.\n\n42:20.740 --> 42:23.060\n Yeah, I thought the ending stank\n\n42:23.060 --> 42:24.620\n and the middle wasn't very good.\n\n42:24.620 --> 42:28.100\n No, when I read that novel,\n\n42:28.100 --> 42:30.020\n I was floored by a couple of things.\n\n42:30.020 --> 42:32.100\n One is, of course, at the moment\n\n42:32.100 --> 42:33.940\n where we realize the devil appears.\n\n42:34.860 --> 42:37.380\n The moment that Ivan says to his brother,\n\n42:37.380 --> 42:39.340\n you know he visits me,\n\n42:39.340 --> 42:41.900\n and you realize that he's talking about the devil,\n\n42:41.900 --> 42:46.900\n the whole novel goes into this totally different space.\n\n42:47.580 --> 42:49.060\n Anyway, it's even more\n\n42:49.060 --> 42:51.660\n than you've already realized the novel's about.\n\n42:51.660 --> 42:54.540\n And then when the conversation occurs between Ivan\n\n42:54.540 --> 42:57.860\n and the devil, I think he describes him\n\n42:57.860 --> 43:01.460\n as dressed in the French style\n\n43:02.860 --> 43:06.060\n of the early part of the 90th century.\n\n43:06.060 --> 43:07.700\n Very strange that the devil would be dressed like that,\n\n43:07.700 --> 43:08.540\n but sort of.\n\n43:10.820 --> 43:13.620\n And if you remember that he's sort of cross legged\n\n43:13.620 --> 43:15.060\n and rather a vain figure,\n\n43:16.100 --> 43:19.580\n but the devil mentions in passing to Ivan\n\n43:19.580 --> 43:22.300\n that he says, I don't know why,\n\n43:22.300 --> 43:27.300\n gratitude is not an instinct that's been given to me.\n\n43:30.980 --> 43:32.180\n Yeah, you're not allowed.\n\n43:32.180 --> 43:35.860\n This is not, given the role of being the devil,\n\n43:35.860 --> 43:37.260\n this is not one of the things.\n\n43:37.260 --> 43:38.100\n Just not one of the things.\n\n43:38.100 --> 43:39.260\n And you think, and of course,\n\n43:39.260 --> 43:42.060\n only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could,\n\n43:42.060 --> 43:45.100\n I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel\n\n43:45.100 --> 43:46.180\n out of that insight.\n\n43:47.060 --> 43:49.300\n Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away\n\n43:49.300 --> 43:51.420\n because there's such an abundance of riches\n\n43:51.420 --> 43:53.500\n that he still has to get through,\n\n43:53.500 --> 43:55.300\n the structural problems aside.\n\n43:55.300 --> 43:58.820\n But the, but the, but the.\n\n43:58.820 --> 44:02.140\n The passive aggressive, the microaggression\n\n44:02.140 --> 44:04.420\n in this conversation is palpable.\n\n44:04.420 --> 44:07.700\n A little knife fight.\n\n44:07.700 --> 44:09.940\n No, but the reason I mention this is because of course,\n\n44:09.940 --> 44:13.460\n when I saw this, this is such a brilliant insight\n\n44:13.460 --> 44:16.940\n by Dostoevsky because why would gratitude\n\n44:16.940 --> 44:19.900\n not be a sentiment that the devil was capable of?\n\n44:19.900 --> 44:22.820\n The answer is of course that if the devil\n\n44:22.820 --> 44:25.980\n was capable of gratitude, he wouldn't be the devil.\n\n44:25.980 --> 44:27.140\n He'd be somebody else.\n\n44:28.740 --> 44:31.460\n He has to be incapable of gratitude.\n\n44:31.460 --> 44:35.460\n Do you think for Dostoevsky that was as strong of an insight\n\n44:35.460 --> 44:36.700\n as it is for you?\n\n44:36.700 --> 44:39.460\n Because I think that's a really powerful idea\n\n44:39.460 --> 44:43.860\n that with gratitude, you don't get the resentment\n\n44:43.860 --> 44:46.100\n that rots you from the core.\n\n44:46.100 --> 44:48.900\n Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things\n\n44:48.900 --> 44:50.820\n that he saw in us.\n\n44:50.820 --> 44:54.020\n And the way I put it is that, I mean,\n\n44:54.020 --> 44:57.940\n I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction,\n\n44:57.940 --> 44:59.500\n which is one of the things I'd like us to call\n\n44:59.500 --> 45:00.980\n the era that's now ending.\n\n45:02.420 --> 45:05.940\n The era of deconstruction was the era that started,\n\n45:05.940 --> 45:08.380\n let's say from the 60s onwards,\n\n45:08.380 --> 45:11.740\n and was originally an academic game\n\n45:11.740 --> 45:13.740\n that then spilled out into the wider culture,\n\n45:13.740 --> 45:16.980\n which was let's take everything apart.\n\n45:16.980 --> 45:19.540\n Let's pull it all apart.\n\n45:19.540 --> 45:20.900\n There are lots of problems with it.\n\n45:20.900 --> 45:22.220\n One is it's quite boring.\n\n45:23.100 --> 45:25.660\n You don't get an awful lot from it.\n\n45:27.860 --> 45:30.780\n You also have the problem of what children find\n\n45:30.780 --> 45:32.540\n when they try to do this with bicycles,\n\n45:32.540 --> 45:34.420\n which is they can take it apart quite easily,\n\n45:34.420 --> 45:36.180\n but they can't put it back together.\n\n45:38.100 --> 45:43.100\n And the era of taking things apart as a game\n\n45:45.220 --> 45:46.220\n is one we've lived through,\n\n45:46.220 --> 45:48.180\n and it's been highly destructive,\n\n45:48.180 --> 45:50.580\n but you can do it for quite a long time.\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:53.100\n I'm going to look at this society,\n\n45:53.100 --> 45:56.620\n and I'm going to take it apart by showing systemic problems.\n\n45:56.620 --> 46:00.380\n I'm going to, at the end of that, what have you got?\n\n46:00.380 --> 46:01.220\n What have you done?\n\n46:01.220 --> 46:03.140\n What have you achieved?\n\n46:03.140 --> 46:05.460\n We need to interrogate this.\n\n46:05.460 --> 46:06.500\n Okay, interrogate.\n\n46:06.500 --> 46:07.420\n By all means, ask questions,\n\n46:07.420 --> 46:11.140\n but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this.\n\n46:11.140 --> 46:13.340\n I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart.\n\n46:13.340 --> 46:17.020\n And again, at the end of it, what have you got?\n\n46:17.020 --> 46:21.180\n Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music\n\n46:21.180 --> 46:24.540\n or an idea or a society, fine.\n\n46:24.540 --> 46:26.300\n Question, endlessly question.\n\n46:26.300 --> 46:31.300\n Yes, interrogate assumes it's all a criminal in a cell\n\n46:33.540 --> 46:37.660\n and it's guilty, and therefore it must be taken apart.\n\n46:37.660 --> 46:41.180\n And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West.\n\n46:41.180 --> 46:43.780\n And that's resentment.\n\n46:43.780 --> 46:46.180\n That's one byproduct of resentment.\n\n46:46.180 --> 46:49.540\n You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart.\n\n46:50.980 --> 46:53.500\n Is a little bit of resentment good?\n\n46:53.500 --> 46:56.940\n So you have that, I love Tom Waits,\n\n46:56.940 --> 47:00.220\n and he has a song where a little drop of,\n\n47:00.220 --> 47:03.020\n I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.\n\n47:03.020 --> 47:05.060\n Is it good to do that?\n\n47:05.060 --> 47:08.300\n Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink?\n\n47:08.300 --> 47:09.620\n Depends what the poison is,\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:12.180\n and it depends if you know not to have another drink.\n\n47:13.700 --> 47:16.140\n It might be the case, you find out, as some alcoholics do,\n\n47:16.140 --> 47:19.820\n that one was too many and 10 is not enough.\n\n47:21.140 --> 47:25.020\n So there's a natural, in this case,\n\n47:25.020 --> 47:27.820\n this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope.\n\n47:27.820 --> 47:29.820\n It becomes an addiction, it becomes a drug,\n\n47:29.820 --> 47:31.100\n and you just can't stop.\n\n47:31.100 --> 47:32.900\n Well, you'd have to wean yourself off it\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:34.620\n and try to start creating again.\n\n47:34.620 --> 47:39.620\n You'd have to start trying to put things together again.\n\n47:40.420 --> 47:45.180\n Something I think might be in the throes of starting\n\n47:45.180 --> 47:46.020\n as it happens.\n\n47:46.900 --> 47:51.340\n Well, speaking of taking things apart\n\n47:51.340 --> 47:53.460\n and not putting them together again,\n\n47:53.460 --> 47:55.640\n the idea of critical race theory.\n\n47:58.180 --> 48:02.220\n Can you, to me, explain, so I'm an engineer\n\n48:02.220 --> 48:05.060\n and have not been actually paying attention much,\n\n48:05.060 --> 48:07.460\n unfortunately, to these things.\n\n48:07.460 --> 48:08.780\n None of the people in your field were\n\n48:08.780 --> 48:11.180\n until it comes along and smacks you in the face.\n\n48:11.180 --> 48:16.180\n I've had that line of thinking from MIT.\n\n48:17.620 --> 48:22.060\n I said, well, surely whatever you folks are busy about\n\n48:22.060 --> 48:26.100\n yelling at each other for is a thing at Harvard and Yale.\n\n48:26.100 --> 48:26.980\n It's not going to.\n\n48:26.980 --> 48:28.820\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.\n\n48:28.820 --> 48:31.420\n People in the STEM subjects thought it's not coming for us.\n\n48:31.420 --> 48:33.700\n It can't come to us and bang.\n\n48:33.700 --> 48:36.660\n Well, it hasn't quite been a bang.\n\n48:36.660 --> 48:37.500\n I'm not sure.\n\n48:37.500 --> 48:39.580\n Engineering is more safe than others.\n\n48:39.580 --> 48:43.000\n Yeah, so let's draw a line now\n\n48:43.000 --> 48:45.380\n between engineering and science.\n\n48:45.380 --> 48:48.220\n So I think engineering is,\n\n48:48.220 --> 48:51.940\n I'm sitting in a castle in the tallest tower\n\n48:51.940 --> 48:55.260\n with my pinky out drinking my martini saying, surely.\n\n48:56.140 --> 49:00.620\n The peasants below with their biology and their humanities\n\n49:00.620 --> 49:02.400\n will figure it all out.\n\n49:02.400 --> 49:03.240\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n49:03.240 --> 49:04.400\n There's no pinky out.\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:07.420\n I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants.\n\n49:07.420 --> 49:08.260\n Okay, where is this?\n\n49:08.260 --> 49:09.860\n This metaphor has gone too far.\n\n49:11.620 --> 49:14.460\n Can you explain to this engineer\n\n49:14.460 --> 49:16.420\n what critical race theory is?\n\n49:16.420 --> 49:19.460\n Is it a term that's definable?\n\n49:19.460 --> 49:20.780\n Is there a tradition?\n\n49:20.780 --> 49:21.620\n Is there a history?\n\n49:21.620 --> 49:24.260\n What is good about it, what is bad about it?\n\n49:24.260 --> 49:25.100\n It is a tradition.\n\n49:25.100 --> 49:25.940\n It is a history.\n\n49:25.940 --> 49:26.760\n It's a school of thought.\n\n49:26.760 --> 49:30.220\n It started in the law roughly in the 1970s\n\n49:30.220 --> 49:31.820\n in some of the American academy.\n\n49:32.740 --> 49:33.740\n It spilled out.\n\n49:33.740 --> 49:36.780\n It always aimed to be an activist philosophy.\n\n49:36.780 --> 49:38.080\n People deny that now,\n\n49:38.080 --> 49:40.420\n but as I cite in The War in the West,\n\n49:40.420 --> 49:43.100\n the foundational texts say as much.\n\n49:43.100 --> 49:48.100\n This is an activist academic study.\n\n49:48.280 --> 49:50.660\n We're not just looking at the law.\n\n49:50.660 --> 49:52.240\n We seek to change the law.\n\n49:53.620 --> 49:56.260\n And it's built out into all of the other disciplines.\n\n49:56.260 --> 49:57.660\n I think there's a reason for that, by the way,\n\n49:57.660 --> 49:58.820\n which is it happened at the time\n\n49:58.820 --> 50:00.500\n that the humanities and others in America\n\n50:00.500 --> 50:03.660\n were increasingly weak and didn't know what to do,\n\n50:03.660 --> 50:06.820\n and they needed more games to play or new games to play.\n\n50:07.820 --> 50:09.420\n The psychologists got bored.\n\n50:09.420 --> 50:12.780\n Yeah, I mean, well, they needed tenure.\n\n50:12.780 --> 50:14.620\n They needed something to do.\n\n50:14.620 --> 50:16.900\n And I mean, it's not an original observation.\n\n50:16.900 --> 50:17.780\n Plenty of people have made this,\n\n50:17.780 --> 50:19.740\n but I mean, Neil Ferguson said it some time ago,\n\n50:19.740 --> 50:23.420\n for instance, that in the last 50 years\n\n50:23.420 --> 50:26.420\n in American academia, certainly in humanities departments,\n\n50:26.420 --> 50:29.980\n when somebody dies out who's a great scholar in something,\n\n50:29.980 --> 50:33.340\n that's just not replaced by somebody of equal stature.\n\n50:33.340 --> 50:36.100\n They're replaced by somebody who does theory\n\n50:36.100 --> 50:38.100\n or critical race theory.\n\n50:38.100 --> 50:41.580\n They're replaced by somebody who does the modern games.\n\n50:41.580 --> 50:44.500\n Somebody dies out who's a great historian of, say,\n\n50:44.500 --> 50:46.960\n I don't know, it's the one that's on my mind,\n\n50:46.960 --> 50:48.740\n Russian history or Russian literature,\n\n50:48.740 --> 50:53.180\n and they're not replaced by a similar scholar.\n\n50:53.180 --> 50:57.660\n In his observation and in yours, is this a recent development?\n\n50:57.660 --> 50:59.940\n It's happened in the last few decades, for sure.\n\n50:59.940 --> 51:01.500\n And it's sped up.\n\n51:01.500 --> 51:02.940\n Is it because we've gotten to the bottom\n\n51:02.940 --> 51:04.960\n of some of the biggest questions of history?\n\n51:04.960 --> 51:08.300\n No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions.\n\n51:09.300 --> 51:12.180\n Because it's more fun to, big questions aren't as fun?\n\n51:12.180 --> 51:15.460\n No, partly it's, no, I should stress that partly isn't,\n\n51:15.460 --> 51:17.620\n this is in the weeds, but partly it's a result\n\n51:17.620 --> 51:19.940\n of the hyper specialization in academia.\n\n51:19.940 --> 51:24.780\n You know, if you said you'd like to write\n\n51:24.780 --> 51:26.760\n your dissertation on Hobbes,\n\n51:31.460 --> 51:36.460\n if you wanted to say something central\n\n51:36.660 --> 51:41.660\n to Kant's thought or Hegel's, I mean, that's not popular.\n\n51:42.780 --> 51:45.920\n What's popular is to take somebody way down the line\n\n51:45.920 --> 51:47.320\n from that, because there's a feeling\n\n51:47.320 --> 51:49.960\n that that's all been done.\n\n51:49.960 --> 51:52.420\n So you take something way, way, way down the line\n\n51:52.420 --> 51:54.220\n from that that's much less important,\n\n51:54.220 --> 51:56.020\n and then you sort of play with that.\n\n51:57.180 --> 51:58.920\n And I think most people, anyone who's watching\n\n51:58.920 --> 52:00.980\n who's been in a philosophy department\n\n52:00.980 --> 52:04.340\n or anything else in recent years will know that tendency.\n\n52:04.340 --> 52:06.900\n By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this.\n\n52:06.900 --> 52:09.020\n I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life\n\n52:09.020 --> 52:12.420\n when he would occasionally, he didn't get tenure\n\n52:12.420 --> 52:15.660\n at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in\n\n52:15.660 --> 52:18.220\n even by his enemies to teach courses\n\n52:18.220 --> 52:20.980\n in various universities in basics of philosophy,\n\n52:20.980 --> 52:24.380\n because there was no one in the department able to do it.\n\n52:24.380 --> 52:28.540\n Like he would go in and teach for a semester,\n\n52:29.500 --> 52:34.020\n you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others,\n\n52:34.020 --> 52:36.120\n because there was no one to do it,\n\n52:36.120 --> 52:38.100\n because they were all playing with the things\n\n52:38.100 --> 52:40.620\n way, way, way down the road from this.\n\n52:40.620 --> 52:42.940\n So that had already happened,\n\n52:42.940 --> 52:45.240\n and people were searching for new games to play,\n\n52:45.240 --> 52:48.880\n and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in,\n\n52:50.060 --> 52:52.540\n partly in the way that all of this\n\n52:52.540 --> 52:54.520\n that's now known as anti racism does,\n\n52:54.520 --> 52:56.760\n which is in a sort of bullying tone\n\n52:56.760 --> 52:58.180\n of saying if you don't follow this.\n\n52:58.180 --> 52:59.900\n It's the same way that all the things\n\n52:59.900 --> 53:01.460\n that are called studies,\n\n53:01.460 --> 53:04.360\n I think everything called studies in the humanities\n\n53:04.360 --> 53:06.920\n should be shut down.\n\n53:06.920 --> 53:09.420\n Because of the activist element.\n\n53:09.420 --> 53:12.760\n They're all activists, gay studies and queer studies,\n\n53:12.760 --> 53:16.360\n and nothing good has ever come from it.\n\n53:16.360 --> 53:17.400\n Nothing good.\n\n53:17.400 --> 53:21.400\n To push back, is it obvious that activism\n\n53:21.400 --> 53:24.720\n is a sign of a flaw in a discipline?\n\n53:24.720 --> 53:26.040\n So isn't it?\n\n53:26.040 --> 53:27.840\n It's a sign of the death of the discipline.\n\n53:27.840 --> 53:29.800\n It's a sign the discipline's over.\n\n53:29.800 --> 53:33.000\n But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline\n\n53:33.000 --> 53:36.460\n to enact change, positive change in the world?\n\n53:36.460 --> 53:41.240\n Or is that for politicians to do with the findings\n\n53:41.240 --> 53:44.240\n of science, not the scientists themselves?\n\n53:44.240 --> 53:47.040\n Why create an ideology and then set out\n\n53:47.040 --> 53:49.960\n to find disciplines that are weakly put together\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:53.560\n to try to back up your political ideology?\n\n53:53.560 --> 53:58.560\n So ideology should not be part of science or of humanities.\n\n54:00.400 --> 54:04.740\n Why would you, I mean, anyone could do it.\n\n54:05.640 --> 54:09.520\n You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing\n\n54:09.520 --> 54:11.320\n about something and only do things\n\n54:11.320 --> 54:13.720\n that prove your right wing ideas.\n\n54:13.720 --> 54:16.280\n Be fantastically antiacademic,\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:18.400\n fantastically anti science.\n\n54:18.400 --> 54:23.400\n It's an absurd way to mix up activism and academia.\n\n54:25.560 --> 54:26.960\n And it's absolutely rife.\n\n54:26.960 --> 54:28.760\n And Critical Race Theory is one of the ones\n\n54:28.760 --> 54:31.680\n that completely polluted the academy.\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:34.360\n Yeah, and there's been dark moments throughout history,\n\n54:34.360 --> 54:38.040\n both during World War II with both communism\n\n54:38.040 --> 54:43.040\n and Nazism, fascism that infiltrated science\n\n54:44.400 --> 54:45.920\n and then corrupted it.\n\n54:45.920 --> 54:47.840\n Yes, I mean, for instance, also,\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:50.560\n let's face it, in science, as in everything else,\n\n54:50.560 --> 54:53.720\n there are dark, difficult things.\n\n54:53.720 --> 54:55.840\n It's much better we know about them, face up to them\n\n54:55.840 --> 54:59.240\n and try to find a way socially to deal with them\n\n54:59.240 --> 55:02.640\n than that you leave them in the hands of some activist\n\n55:02.640 --> 55:04.960\n who wants to do stuff with them.\n\n55:04.960 --> 55:07.720\n Some of my best friends are activists.\n\n55:07.720 --> 55:09.080\n I'm just kidding, okay.\n\n55:09.080 --> 55:11.240\n None of my best friends are activists.\n\n55:11.240 --> 55:12.480\n That's how it should be.\n\n55:13.960 --> 55:15.880\n Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends,\n\n55:15.880 --> 55:16.720\n but okay.\n\n55:18.120 --> 55:22.960\n No, I'm trying to gain some pity points.\n\n55:22.960 --> 55:24.520\n Okay, so to return.\n\n55:24.520 --> 55:27.040\n You have your clubhouse friends.\n\n55:27.040 --> 55:31.280\n Screaming away like deranged maniacs.\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:32.400\n Now, I'm anti clubhouse, by the way,\n\n55:32.400 --> 55:34.720\n because the only time I heard it was at Brett Weinstein one\n\n55:34.720 --> 55:36.360\n when he did that.\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:38.280\n I don't know if you heard that, early in clubhouse.\n\n55:38.280 --> 55:39.960\n I was invited to clubhouse by various people.\n\n55:39.960 --> 55:41.520\n He was like, oh, this is a really great civilized way\n\n55:41.520 --> 55:43.600\n to hang out and talk with interesting people.\n\n55:43.600 --> 55:46.520\n And I downloaded the app and I got on one,\n\n55:46.520 --> 55:48.480\n because Brett Weinstein said,\n\n55:48.480 --> 55:50.120\n I'm doing this conversation and I listened\n\n55:50.120 --> 55:54.160\n and it was the maddest damn discussion I've ever heard.\n\n55:54.160 --> 55:55.600\n Was it something about biology?\n\n55:55.600 --> 55:58.960\n Something about, was it during COVID times?\n\n55:58.960 --> 56:01.200\n At some point, Brett said,\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:06.200\n I'm an evolutionary biologist.\n\n56:06.200 --> 56:09.760\n And somebody else started saying, you're a eugenicist.\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:12.440\n And he said, no, I'm an evolutionary biologist.\n\n56:12.440 --> 56:14.920\n And somebody said, that's the same thing.\n\n56:14.920 --> 56:16.520\n And it just went on like that.\n\n56:16.520 --> 56:19.000\n And Brett desperately tried to explain,\n\n56:19.000 --> 56:21.600\n that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist.\n\n56:21.600 --> 56:24.040\n And he lost the clubhouse room.\n\n56:24.040 --> 56:25.720\n They thought that was the same thing.\n\n56:25.720 --> 56:29.120\n He'd come, it horribly reminded me of a time some years ago\n\n56:29.120 --> 56:32.680\n when a British newspaper ran a sort of realizing\n\n56:32.680 --> 56:34.240\n that the only thing you can unite people on\n\n56:34.240 --> 56:37.640\n in sexual ethics is revulsion against pedophilia,\n\n56:37.640 --> 56:40.000\n ran an anti pedo campaign.\n\n56:40.000 --> 56:43.720\n And shortly after pediatricians offices\n\n56:43.720 --> 56:46.000\n were torched in North of England\n\n56:46.000 --> 56:48.880\n by a mob who hadn't read the whole sign.\n\n56:48.880 --> 56:53.020\n Yeah, well, to me, like I said,\n\n56:53.020 --> 56:55.420\n a little bit of poison is good for the town, so.\n\n56:55.420 --> 56:56.840\n Anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you\n\n56:56.840 --> 56:58.760\n with flattering you with their people on clubhouse.\n\n56:58.760 --> 57:03.760\n I have many, I have multiples of friends, yes.\n\n57:04.320 --> 57:08.080\n Okay, we didn't get to some of the ideas\n\n57:08.080 --> 57:09.480\n of critical race theory.\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:11.940\n What exactly is it?\n\n57:11.940 --> 57:14.480\n I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely.\n\n57:14.480 --> 57:17.580\n Yeah, it's an attempt to look at everything\n\n57:17.580 --> 57:20.220\n among other things through the lens of race\n\n57:20.220 --> 57:24.360\n and to add race into things where it may not be\n\n57:24.360 --> 57:26.220\n as a way of adding,\n\n57:26.220 --> 57:30.040\n I'm trying to give the most generous estimation,\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:31.880\n to add race in as a conversation\n\n57:31.880 --> 57:35.140\n in a place where it may not have been in the conversation.\n\n57:36.960 --> 57:38.600\n And that means history too?\n\n57:38.600 --> 57:40.440\n The history of racism.\n\n57:40.440 --> 57:43.320\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, all history.\n\n57:43.320 --> 57:45.920\n And to look at it through these particular lenses.\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:50.800\n I mean, there's a certain, like all these things,\n\n57:50.800 --> 57:51.880\n there's a certain logic in it.\n\n57:51.880 --> 57:54.960\n Like with feminist studies or something,\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:57.280\n I mean, is there a utility in looking back\n\n57:57.280 --> 57:59.880\n through undoubtedly male dominated histories\n\n57:59.880 --> 58:03.640\n and asking where the more silent female voice was?\n\n58:03.640 --> 58:06.100\n Yes, very interesting.\n\n58:06.100 --> 58:08.440\n Not endlessly interesting.\n\n58:08.440 --> 58:12.800\n And can't be put exactly on the same par as,\n\n58:12.800 --> 58:14.860\n but it has a utility.\n\n58:16.660 --> 58:18.480\n It's that endlessly, sorry to interrupt,\n\n58:18.480 --> 58:20.240\n that endlessly part that seems to get us\n\n58:20.240 --> 58:21.600\n into trouble a lot here.\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:24.300\n Well, because of this thing of where do you stop?\n\n58:24.300 --> 58:29.300\n And that's always, I talked about this in my last book\n\n58:30.920 --> 58:32.120\n in the manners of crowds.\n\n58:32.120 --> 58:35.560\n It's one of the big conundrums in activist movements\n\n58:35.560 --> 58:38.520\n and particularly in activist academia.\n\n58:38.520 --> 58:39.360\n Where would you stop?\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:42.080\n It's not clear because you've got a job in it.\n\n58:42.080 --> 58:44.000\n You've got a pension in it.\n\n58:44.000 --> 58:48.480\n You've got, your only esteem in society\n\n58:48.480 --> 58:50.300\n is in keeping this gig going.\n\n58:50.300 --> 58:55.300\n I mean, is there any likelihood?\n\n58:55.660 --> 58:58.780\n Have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't it?\n\n58:58.780 --> 59:00.900\n The end of every conference, the only thing everyone\n\n59:00.900 --> 59:02.740\n agrees on is that we must have another conference\n\n59:02.740 --> 59:03.580\n like this one.\n\n59:05.220 --> 59:07.300\n It's the one thing they always agree on.\n\n59:07.300 --> 59:09.780\n This conference is so great, we must have another one.\n\n59:09.780 --> 59:11.300\n Well, that's a criticism you could apply\n\n59:11.300 --> 59:12.460\n to a lot of disciplines.\n\n59:12.460 --> 59:13.300\n Of course.\n\n59:13.300 --> 59:15.460\n Civil engineering, bridge building.\n\n59:15.460 --> 59:19.060\n At a certain point, do we need any more bridges?\n\n59:19.060 --> 59:20.780\n Can we just fly everywhere?\n\n59:22.340 --> 59:23.180\n So.\n\n59:23.180 --> 59:26.100\n At the very least, you need to keep the bridges up.\n\n59:26.100 --> 59:28.820\n Sure, and they would, critical race theory folks\n\n59:28.820 --> 59:30.940\n would probably make the same argument.\n\n59:30.940 --> 59:33.540\n At the very least, we need to keep the racism out.\n\n59:35.100 --> 59:37.700\n We have to make sure we don't descend into the racism.\n\n59:37.700 --> 59:39.820\n It assumes all the time that we are living\n\n59:39.820 --> 59:42.320\n on the cusp of the return of the KKK.\n\n59:42.320 --> 59:43.160\n Right.\n\n59:43.160 --> 59:44.580\n Which is totally wrong.\n\n59:44.580 --> 59:45.540\n I mean, it's a massive.\n\n59:45.540 --> 59:49.940\n You say that now, until the KKK armies march in.\n\n59:49.940 --> 59:52.500\n We don't always, we can't always predict the future.\n\n59:52.500 --> 59:53.820\n We can't always predict the future,\n\n59:53.820 --> 59:58.460\n and you can always say you should be careful,\n\n59:58.460 --> 1:00:02.700\n but you've also gotta be careful of people\n\n1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:05.300\n who've got their timing like totally, totally wrong,\n\n1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:07.020\n or their estimation of the society they're in.\n\n1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:12.020\n You mean like most of society before in the 1930s,\n\n1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:17.020\n when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong.\n\n1:00:17.140 --> 1:00:18.140\n Sure they did.\n\n1:00:18.140 --> 1:00:18.980\n And so.\n\n1:00:18.980 --> 1:00:19.820\n Most people.\n\n1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:23.660\n So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there.\n\n1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:24.500\n Well.\n\n1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:27.640\n Beware of the man with the mustache.\n\n1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:28.480\n Yes.\n\n1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:29.800\n If only it was that easy.\n\n1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:33.340\n Not always a bob facial hair.\n\n1:00:33.340 --> 1:00:35.660\n I always say that, I mean, what.\n\n1:00:35.660 --> 1:00:36.580\n Very often is.\n\n1:00:36.580 --> 1:00:39.220\n These two clean shaven chaps both say,\n\n1:00:39.220 --> 1:00:40.220\n one of the problems of everybody\n\n1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.660\n knowing a little bit about Nazism\n\n1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:47.660\n is that they think that they know where evil comes from\n\n1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:52.100\n and that it comes from like a German with a small mustache,\n\n1:00:52.100 --> 1:00:54.800\n getting people to goose step, for instance.\n\n1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:56.280\n And that's not correct.\n\n1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.600\n A much better understanding of it is,\n\n1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:03.120\n it can come from all number of directions\n\n1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.260\n and keep your antennae as good as you can.\n\n1:01:06.260 --> 1:01:10.300\n But once you end up in this society, which I would argue,\n\n1:01:10.300 --> 1:01:15.040\n certainly parts of America, where you're always in 1938,\n\n1:01:15.040 --> 1:01:17.940\n that's not healthy for a society either,\n\n1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:22.020\n where people are so primed and think they're so well trained\n\n1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:25.820\n because they spent a term in school\n\n1:01:25.820 --> 1:01:28.140\n learning about the Second World War and the Holocaust,\n\n1:01:28.140 --> 1:01:30.900\n think they're so well trained in Hitler spotting\n\n1:01:31.780 --> 1:01:32.980\n that they can do it all the time.\n\n1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:35.300\n Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies,\n\n1:01:35.300 --> 1:01:37.300\n like dog whistle.\n\n1:01:37.300 --> 1:01:38.140\n You know, as I always say,\n\n1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:40.120\n if you hear the whistle, you're the dog.\n\n1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:43.340\n But people say, that's a dog whistle,\n\n1:01:43.340 --> 1:01:46.460\n as if they're highly trained anti Nazis.\n\n1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:50.140\n I mean, you know, there should be some humility in it.\n\n1:01:50.140 --> 1:01:52.800\n We should be careful, we should be wary for sure.\n\n1:01:54.300 --> 1:01:57.220\n And we should also be slightly humble\n\n1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:01.560\n in our inability to spot everything.\n\n1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:06.560\n If not significantly humble, right, so if we can,\n\n1:02:10.860 --> 1:02:15.400\n there's something funny, if not dark,\n\n1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:19.900\n about the activity of Hitler spotting,\n\n1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:21.480\n if I just may take an aside.\n\n1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:26.480\n But so critical race theory, how much racism,\n\n1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:28.700\n what is racism?\n\n1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:31.200\n How much of it is in our world today?\n\n1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:34.640\n If we were thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting,\n\n1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:39.620\n and trying to steel man the case\n\n1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:41.100\n of if not critical race theory,\n\n1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:45.740\n but people who look for racism in our world,\n\n1:02:45.740 --> 1:02:48.100\n how much would you say?\n\n1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:50.100\n Well, it's a good thing to try to define.\n\n1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:54.880\n I would say that racism is the belief\n\n1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:57.860\n that other people are inferior to you.\n\n1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:00.140\n You could say, you could see a form of it\n\n1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:02.460\n where you thought people were superior to you.\n\n1:03:02.460 --> 1:03:04.620\n That could also happen, but more commonly,\n\n1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:07.260\n you see a group of people as being inferior to you\n\n1:03:07.260 --> 1:03:08.580\n simply by dint of the fact\n\n1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:11.280\n that they have a different racial background.\n\n1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:17.380\n And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism.\n\n1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:23.380\n As I say, I mean, there are types of racism,\n\n1:03:23.380 --> 1:03:26.820\n mainly antisemitism actually, perhaps it's the only one,\n\n1:03:26.820 --> 1:03:30.860\n which weirdly relies on a hatred of people\n\n1:03:30.860 --> 1:03:34.660\n who a certain type of person thinks are better than them.\n\n1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:37.900\n And that's a particular peculiarity,\n\n1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:40.160\n one of the peculiarities of antisemitism.\n\n1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:42.820\n Well, antisemitism somehow does both, right?\n\n1:03:42.820 --> 1:03:46.340\n Yes, one of the eternal fascinating things\n\n1:03:46.340 --> 1:03:47.860\n about antisemitism is it can do,\n\n1:03:47.860 --> 1:03:49.980\n it does everything at the same time.\n\n1:03:50.820 --> 1:03:52.860\n It's like a quantum racism.\n\n1:03:52.860 --> 1:03:53.700\n Yes.\n\n1:03:53.700 --> 1:03:54.940\n They're both superior and inferior.\n\n1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:58.920\n You know Vasily Grosman's Life and Fate?\n\n1:03:59.980 --> 1:04:02.340\n So in the middle of Life and Fate,\n\n1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:03.780\n which a Persian friend of mine always said\n\n1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:06.020\n was one of only two great novels of the 20th century,\n\n1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:07.980\n she was a very harsh literary critic.\n\n1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:09.020\n What was the other one?\n\n1:04:09.020 --> 1:04:10.880\n Oh, The Leopard, obviously.\n\n1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:11.720\n The Leopard?\n\n1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:14.060\n The Leopard by Giuseppe Dallan Pedusa, yeah.\n\n1:04:14.060 --> 1:04:14.900\n Okay.\n\n1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:16.840\n She's definitely right on that one.\n\n1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:17.680\n Life and Fate is a...\n\n1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.520\n I'm learning so much today, yes.\n\n1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:24.000\n Life and Fate is an extraordinary book,\n\n1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:28.660\n mainly about, well, you know, Grosman was obviously\n\n1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:33.660\n Jewish himself, but he saw almost everything\n\n1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:36.220\n that he could have done in the Second World War.\n\n1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:38.700\n He saw Stalingrad, he was a journalist,\n\n1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:42.020\n and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad.\n\n1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:45.940\n He was also the first journalist into Treblinka,\n\n1:04:45.940 --> 1:04:47.380\n and his account, which you can read in one\n\n1:04:47.380 --> 1:04:49.300\n of the collections of his journalism,\n\n1:04:49.300 --> 1:04:51.260\n his account of walking into Treblinka\n\n1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:54.660\n is just one of the most devastating, haunting pieces\n\n1:04:54.660 --> 1:04:56.700\n of journalism or prose you can read.\n\n1:04:56.700 --> 1:04:58.800\n Anyhow, I mention him because Grosman,\n\n1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:00.260\n in the middle of Life and Fate,\n\n1:05:00.260 --> 1:05:02.220\n which is about a 900 page novel,\n\n1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:06.160\n in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis\n\n1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.160\n around Stalingrad, he, well, at one point,\n\n1:05:12.580 --> 1:05:14.300\n he amazingly sort of goes into the minds\n\n1:05:14.300 --> 1:05:17.420\n of Earth Hitler and Stalin, and he says,\n\n1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:22.180\n Stalin, in his study, feels his counterpart\n\n1:05:22.180 --> 1:05:24.300\n in Berlin, and he says he feels very close\n\n1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:25.400\n to him at this moment.\n\n1:05:26.420 --> 1:05:29.700\n Wow, around Stalingrad, like leading up to the back.\n\n1:05:29.700 --> 1:05:32.100\n After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost,\n\n1:05:32.100 --> 1:05:34.220\n he says he feels the closeness of Hitler.\n\n1:05:35.300 --> 1:05:37.460\n But Grosman, in the middle of Life and Fate,\n\n1:05:37.460 --> 1:05:40.540\n slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century,\n\n1:05:41.740 --> 1:05:45.680\n suddenly dedicates a chapter to anti semitism,\n\n1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:48.900\n and I've seen anti semitism as something\n\n1:05:48.900 --> 1:05:51.460\n I've always been very interested in,\n\n1:05:51.460 --> 1:05:54.780\n because I've always had an instinctive utter revulsion\n\n1:05:54.780 --> 1:05:59.780\n of it, and also partly because of having seen bits of it\n\n1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:02.820\n in the Middle East and elsewhere,\n\n1:06:02.820 --> 1:06:05.340\n but I mention this because Grosman,\n\n1:06:05.340 --> 1:06:08.140\n in the middle of Life and Fate, takes time out\n\n1:06:08.140 --> 1:06:10.620\n and does this like three page explanation,\n\n1:06:10.620 --> 1:06:12.900\n three page description of anti semitism,\n\n1:06:12.900 --> 1:06:14.260\n and it's extraordinary.\n\n1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:16.060\n I mean, the only thing I can think of\n\n1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:19.060\n that's equally good is Gregor von Retzori,\n\n1:06:24.260 --> 1:06:28.860\n who wrote a luridly titled, but brilliant set of novellas\n\n1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.460\n called The Confessions of an Anti Semite,\n\n1:06:31.460 --> 1:06:35.420\n and about pre First World War anti semitism\n\n1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:36.740\n in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\n1:06:36.740 --> 1:06:40.900\n Anyway, Grosman says, in the middle of Life and Fate,\n\n1:06:40.900 --> 1:06:44.820\n that one of the extraordinary things about anti semitism\n\n1:06:44.820 --> 1:06:47.260\n is that it does everything at the same time,\n\n1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:50.140\n that the Jews get condemned in one place for being rich\n\n1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:52.340\n and in another for being poor,\n\n1:06:52.340 --> 1:06:54.820\n condemned in one place for assimilating\n\n1:06:54.820 --> 1:06:56.920\n and another for not assimilating,\n\n1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:01.820\n for assimilating too much and assimilating too little,\n\n1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:05.500\n for being too successful for not being successful enough.\n\n1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:10.980\n So I think it's the only racism that includes within it,\n\n1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:14.500\n a detestation, for the real anti semit,\n\n1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:17.580\n a detestation of people that the person may perceive\n\n1:07:17.580 --> 1:07:21.300\n to be better than them, correctly or otherwise.\n\n1:07:21.300 --> 1:07:24.740\n By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read\n\n1:07:24.740 --> 1:07:26.620\n this one of two greatest novels\n\n1:07:26.620 --> 1:07:29.540\n of the 20th century, Life and Fate, Zhizny Sidba.\n\n1:07:29.540 --> 1:07:31.180\n And just to read off of Wikipedia,\n\n1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:32.860\n we see that Grosman, a Ukrainian Jew,\n\n1:07:32.860 --> 1:07:35.700\n became a correspondent for the Soviet military paper,\n\n1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:38.300\n Krasnaya Zvezda, having volunteered\n\n1:07:38.300 --> 1:07:40.700\n and been rejected from military service,\n\n1:07:40.700 --> 1:07:43.140\n he spent a thousand days in the front lines,\n\n1:07:43.140 --> 1:07:45.540\n roughly three of the four years of the conflict\n\n1:07:45.540 --> 1:07:48.060\n between the Germans and the Soviets,\n\n1:07:48.060 --> 1:07:50.440\n and the main themes covered in,\n\n1:07:51.860 --> 1:07:55.340\n how's it go, Life and Fate, I keep thinking Zhizny Sidba,\n\n1:07:55.340 --> 1:07:58.500\n is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust,\n\n1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:01.180\n Grosman's idea of humanity and the human goodness,\n\n1:08:01.180 --> 1:08:04.460\n Stalin's distortion of reality and values,\n\n1:08:04.460 --> 1:08:07.980\n and science, life goes on, and reality of war.\n\n1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:10.780\n It's interesting, I need to definitely, definitely read it.\n\n1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:13.260\n I think you'll really get a lot from it.\n\n1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:14.660\n One of the other things, sorry, I'm raffling it,\n\n1:08:14.660 --> 1:08:15.860\n but one of the other things he does\n\n1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:17.860\n is that he has this extraordinary ability\n\n1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:22.820\n to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict\n\n1:08:22.820 --> 1:08:24.860\n and then zoom in, it's rather like the camera work\n\n1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:26.700\n they use in things like Lord of the Rings,\n\n1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:30.300\n where he zooms down and gets one person\n\n1:08:30.300 --> 1:08:32.900\n in the midst of all this, and you get on that.\n\n1:08:32.900 --> 1:08:34.180\n Or puts you in the study, too.\n\n1:08:34.180 --> 1:08:36.820\n So I personally have read and reread\n\n1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:39.460\n the William Shires, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\n\n1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:42.860\n who's another journalist who was there,\n\n1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:46.580\n but he does not do, interestingly enough,\n\n1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:50.660\n given such a large novel, kind of the definitive work,\n\n1:08:50.660 --> 1:08:52.720\n the definitive original work that goes\n\n1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:54.940\n to source materials on Hitler,\n\n1:08:54.940 --> 1:08:59.940\n he doesn't touch anti semitism really.\n\n1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:01.260\n So.\n\n1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:02.480\n Big thing to miss out.\n\n1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:06.900\n Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively\n\n1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:08.280\n as he does for most of the work,\n\n1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.260\n that this was the fact of life.\n\n1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:13.820\n There's a lot of cruelty throughout,\n\n1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:15.220\n but he doesn't get to.\n\n1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:16.820\n Well, one of the things is, of course,\n\n1:09:16.820 --> 1:09:19.780\n they lost the war because of anti semitism.\n\n1:09:19.780 --> 1:09:22.500\n I mean, that's one kind of important way to view it.\n\n1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:24.420\n It's how Andrew Roberts, another historian, said it,\n\n1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:26.700\n is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war\n\n1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:27.940\n because they were Nazis.\n\n1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:32.460\n It sounds almost too neat, but it's worth remembering\n\n1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:35.660\n that at the end of the war,\n\n1:09:35.660 --> 1:09:38.740\n when the Germans need to be transporting troops\n\n1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:42.620\n and they need to be transporting very basic supplies,\n\n1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:45.140\n Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains\n\n1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:49.180\n to transport the Jews right up to the end.\n\n1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:52.500\n Well, that's certainly a dark possibility.\n\n1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.860\n Anyhow, but to go back to racism in general.\n\n1:09:55.860 --> 1:09:58.020\n Racism in general, apart from anti semitism,\n\n1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:03.020\n relies on the perception that another group of people,\n\n1:10:04.260 --> 1:10:07.940\n a racial group, other than your own, are inferior to you.\n\n1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:11.220\n That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism.\n\n1:10:11.220 --> 1:10:15.340\n And of course, it's one of the stupidest things\n\n1:10:15.340 --> 1:10:17.860\n that our species is capable of.\n\n1:10:17.860 --> 1:10:19.660\n I mean, one of the stupidest,\n\n1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:23.340\n that you can look at a person and guess them\n\n1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:28.140\n in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color.\n\n1:10:28.140 --> 1:10:31.820\n I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is,\n\n1:10:31.820 --> 1:10:32.860\n as well as being an evil one.\n\n1:10:32.860 --> 1:10:37.860\n But I would say that one of the,\n\n1:10:39.020 --> 1:10:41.140\n I think it's a dangerous thing in our era\n\n1:10:41.140 --> 1:10:43.060\n that there are bits of it coming back.\n\n1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:45.060\n That's why I say we do need sort of,\n\n1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:48.540\n we need our antennae working.\n\n1:10:48.540 --> 1:10:50.460\n We just don't need them to be overactive\n\n1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:52.220\n or underactive, you know.\n\n1:10:53.260 --> 1:10:55.460\n Now, the book is War in the West,\n\n1:10:55.460 --> 1:11:00.260\n but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups\n\n1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:01.460\n based on their skin color,\n\n1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:05.340\n you've said that there's a war on white people in the US.\n\n1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:06.660\n Would you say that's the case?\n\n1:11:06.660 --> 1:11:08.900\n Would you say that there is significant\n\n1:11:11.060 --> 1:11:13.420\n racism towards white people in the United States?\n\n1:11:13.420 --> 1:11:15.500\n I'd say that white people in the United States\n\n1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:16.540\n are the only people who are told\n\n1:11:16.540 --> 1:11:18.540\n that they have hereditary sin.\n\n1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:22.340\n And that's a big one, just to start with.\n\n1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:23.660\n Based strictly on the color of their skin.\n\n1:11:23.660 --> 1:11:25.620\n Based on their skin color.\n\n1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:29.420\n I mean, I would find it so repugnant if,\n\n1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:31.660\n and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this,\n\n1:11:31.660 --> 1:11:33.660\n I would feel it so repugnant\n\n1:11:33.660 --> 1:11:36.140\n if there were any school of thought in America today\n\n1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:41.140\n that had any grasp on the public attention\n\n1:11:41.140 --> 1:11:43.900\n that said that black people were born into evil\n\n1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:46.340\n because of something their ancestors had done.\n\n1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:49.660\n Like they had the mark of Cain upon them.\n\n1:11:49.660 --> 1:11:54.260\n I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way\n\n1:11:54.260 --> 1:11:59.260\n to try to demoralize a group of people\n\n1:11:59.260 --> 1:12:02.700\n and to tell them that the things they would be able\n\n1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:04.860\n to achieve in their lives are much lessened\n\n1:12:04.860 --> 1:12:07.780\n because they should spend significant portions\n\n1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:09.700\n of their lives trying to do something\n\n1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:11.300\n that they didn't do.\n\n1:12:11.300 --> 1:12:12.980\n Is there a difference?\n\n1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:17.220\n And the obvious point left unsaid,\n\n1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:22.220\n but let's say it, nobody in the public square says that.\n\n1:12:23.420 --> 1:12:25.620\n I mean, they're the maniacs at the far fringes,\n\n1:12:25.620 --> 1:12:29.900\n but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that,\n\n1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.420\n or I think even think that about any group of people\n\n1:12:32.420 --> 1:12:34.140\n other than white people.\n\n1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:37.940\n And does this mean that white people are more likely\n\n1:12:37.940 --> 1:12:41.220\n or does this mean that white people are more disadvantaged\n\n1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:42.180\n than black people?\n\n1:12:42.180 --> 1:12:44.980\n No, and again, let's not make this a competition,\n\n1:12:44.980 --> 1:12:48.700\n but let's not get into, I just desperately urge people\n\n1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:51.380\n not to get into the idea of hereditary sin\n\n1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:53.980\n according to racial background.\n\n1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:57.220\n Is there something to be said about the feature aspect,\n\n1:12:57.220 --> 1:12:59.140\n sort of play devil's advocate,\n\n1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:04.140\n about the asymmetry of sort of accusations\n\n1:13:04.820 --> 1:13:06.340\n towards the majority?\n\n1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:09.260\n So because white, so it's easier to attack a majority.\n\n1:13:09.260 --> 1:13:11.300\n It is much easier, but is there something to be said\n\n1:13:11.300 --> 1:13:14.060\n about that being a useful function of society\n\n1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:19.060\n that you always attack, that the minority has\n\n1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:22.100\n disproportionate power to attack the majority\n\n1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:24.860\n so that you can always keep the majority in check?\n\n1:13:24.860 --> 1:13:28.220\n Well, it's a dangerous game to play, isn't it?\n\n1:13:28.220 --> 1:13:29.060\n I think.\n\n1:13:29.060 --> 1:13:30.500\n It's a very dangerous game to play.\n\n1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:33.340\n That's a good summary of entirety of human civilization.\n\n1:13:33.340 --> 1:13:35.820\n Oh yeah, everything is dangerous.\n\n1:13:35.820 --> 1:13:37.780\n But it's a very dangerous game to play that.\n\n1:13:37.780 --> 1:13:39.700\n I wrote about this a bit in the Madness of Crowds\n\n1:13:39.700 --> 1:13:43.060\n when I was saying like gay rights people,\n\n1:13:43.060 --> 1:13:44.380\n the ones that still exist,\n\n1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:46.380\n the ones who don't have homes to go to,\n\n1:13:47.300 --> 1:13:51.580\n who want to beat up on straight people in a way,\n\n1:13:51.580 --> 1:13:53.940\n or want to make straight people feel like they're\n\n1:13:54.940 --> 1:13:59.940\n kind of unremarkable, uncool, you know, boring straights.\n\n1:14:00.780 --> 1:14:02.380\n So boring.\n\n1:14:02.380 --> 1:14:06.100\n So not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays.\n\n1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.820\n That's a bad idea to push that one.\n\n1:14:10.820 --> 1:14:11.740\n That's a bad idea.\n\n1:14:11.740 --> 1:14:13.580\n And some gays push that.\n\n1:14:15.420 --> 1:14:19.100\n Highly unwise, given the fact that about\n\n1:14:19.100 --> 1:14:21.060\n two to 3% of the population are actually gay,\n\n1:14:21.060 --> 1:14:23.740\n although now there's like an additional 20%\n\n1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:25.900\n who think they're like two spirit or something\n\n1:14:25.900 --> 1:14:30.900\n and all that bullshit, but they're just attention seekers.\n\n1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:34.140\n So let's not spend too much time on that.\n\n1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:37.300\n But equally, as I said in the Madness of Crowds,\n\n1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:40.580\n with the feminist movement,\n\n1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:43.420\n very unwise for half of the species\n\n1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:46.180\n to say that the other half of the species isn't needed.\n\n1:14:47.220 --> 1:14:49.900\n And there were always third and fourth wave feminists\n\n1:14:49.900 --> 1:14:52.180\n willing to make that nuts argument.\n\n1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:54.860\n Not first wave feminists.\n\n1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:56.020\n You didn't hear it in first wave feminists.\n\n1:14:56.020 --> 1:14:56.860\n You didn't hear it.\n\n1:14:56.860 --> 1:15:00.300\n Suffragette tended not to say we like the vote\n\n1:15:00.300 --> 1:15:02.340\n and men are scum.\n\n1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:05.180\n It would have been hard to have won everyone\n\n1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:06.540\n over to their side.\n\n1:15:06.540 --> 1:15:09.180\n Not least the men they needed to win over to their side.\n\n1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:10.860\n But you do get third and fourth wave feminists\n\n1:15:10.860 --> 1:15:14.020\n who say like, do we need men?\n\n1:15:14.020 --> 1:15:15.460\n Or men are all X.\n\n1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:17.340\n Again, it's a bad idea.\n\n1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:19.740\n It's a bad idea tactically.\n\n1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:24.480\n What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard,\n\n1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:29.620\n describes that men are the originators of violence,\n\n1:15:29.620 --> 1:15:31.660\n physical violence in society.\n\n1:15:31.660 --> 1:15:35.540\n And he argues that actually the world would be better off.\n\n1:15:35.540 --> 1:15:38.660\n No, just a very cold calculus.\n\n1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:40.180\n If you get rid of men,\n\n1:15:40.180 --> 1:15:44.300\n there will be a lot less violence in society is his claim.\n\n1:15:44.300 --> 1:15:47.580\n But who says you need to get rid of violence in society?\n\n1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:50.460\n But shouldn't that at least be a discussion?\n\n1:15:50.460 --> 1:15:51.660\n The pros and cons.\n\n1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:54.140\n Have a debate, a panel discussion,\n\n1:15:54.140 --> 1:15:55.620\n violence, pros and cons.\n\n1:15:55.620 --> 1:15:57.540\n Well, that's the sort of thing, if I can say so,\n\n1:15:57.540 --> 1:15:59.980\n that some weak ass academic decides to do\n\n1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:02.580\n because he thinks that his area of Boston\n\n1:16:02.580 --> 1:16:04.300\n would be nicer or whatever.\n\n1:16:06.380 --> 1:16:07.780\n He might decide it's useful\n\n1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:12.240\n if he was living in Kiev today to have violent men.\n\n1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:17.980\n I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now,\n\n1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:20.560\n I'd need some violent men around here.\n\n1:16:22.020 --> 1:16:25.740\n But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men.\n\n1:16:25.740 --> 1:16:30.740\n Well, there's also, at least there's some level of threat\n\n1:16:32.020 --> 1:16:35.660\n that you ought to exude that puts people off.\n\n1:16:35.660 --> 1:16:39.580\n If I was in, you know, I'm very glad\n\n1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:42.540\n that the men and women of Ukraine are capable of\n\n1:16:42.540 --> 1:16:47.540\n and more than capable of fighting for their country\n\n1:16:47.620 --> 1:16:49.860\n and for their neighbors and their families and much more.\n\n1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:54.860\n But it's better that there was violence ready to unleash\n\n1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:57.100\n when violence was unleashed upon them\n\n1:16:57.100 --> 1:16:59.020\n than that the whole society had been told\n\n1:16:59.020 --> 1:17:01.320\n that they should identify as non binary.\n\n1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:05.460\n But at least it's a conversation to have.\n\n1:17:05.460 --> 1:17:10.460\n Isn't there aspect to the sort of the feminist movement\n\n1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:17.060\n that is correct in challenging the...\n\n1:17:17.060 --> 1:17:20.200\n Some forms of violence, domestic violence, for instance.\n\n1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:23.060\n Although women are capable of that as well.\n\n1:17:23.060 --> 1:17:24.380\n I'm learning about this.\n\n1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:26.820\n We're all learning about this at the moment.\n\n1:17:26.820 --> 1:17:29.220\n I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down\n\n1:17:29.220 --> 1:17:31.460\n in this beautiful mess that is human relations.\n\n1:17:31.460 --> 1:17:32.300\n Okay.\n\n1:17:32.300 --> 1:17:33.660\n But just to finish up that thought,\n\n1:17:33.660 --> 1:17:38.660\n it's very unwise for women to war against men\n\n1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:41.220\n as it would be for men to war against women.\n\n1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:45.300\n It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population.\n\n1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:47.740\n And in America, Britain and other Western countries,\n\n1:17:47.740 --> 1:17:49.780\n white people are still a majority.\n\n1:17:49.780 --> 1:17:52.900\n And so why would you tell the majority of their evil\n\n1:17:52.900 --> 1:17:55.140\n by dint of their skin color?\n\n1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:56.700\n And think that that would be a good way\n\n1:17:56.700 --> 1:17:58.100\n to keep them in check.\n\n1:17:59.060 --> 1:18:02.060\n I mean, I'm not guilty of anything because of my skin color.\n\n1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:03.300\n I'm not guilty of anything.\n\n1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:05.820\n My ancestors didn't do anything wrong.\n\n1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:06.700\n And even if they had,\n\n1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:08.780\n why would I be held responsible for it?\n\n1:18:09.980 --> 1:18:13.100\n So to go back to Nietzsche,\n\n1:18:13.100 --> 1:18:14.780\n is there some aspect to where,\n\n1:18:14.780 --> 1:18:18.300\n if we try to explain the forces at play here,\n\n1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:22.500\n is it the will to power playing itself out\n\n1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:23.980\n from individual human nature\n\n1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:27.780\n and from group behavior nature?\n\n1:18:27.780 --> 1:18:30.020\n Is there some elements to this\n\n1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:32.740\n which is the game we play as human beings\n\n1:18:32.740 --> 1:18:34.780\n is always when we have less power,\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:36.900\n we try to find ways to gain more power.\n\n1:18:36.900 --> 1:18:39.260\n That's certainly one.\n\n1:18:39.260 --> 1:18:42.740\n The desire to grab is,\n\n1:18:42.740 --> 1:18:45.780\n let me see if I can find a quote for you on that.\n\n1:18:45.780 --> 1:18:49.860\n The desire to grab that which we think we're owed\n\n1:18:49.860 --> 1:18:54.220\n and to do it often in the guise of justice.\n\n1:18:56.780 --> 1:19:00.700\n I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age\n\n1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:03.740\n and one of the great bogus terms of our age.\n\n1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:06.140\n People forever talk about their search for justice.\n\n1:19:06.140 --> 1:19:08.300\n It's amazing how violent they can often be\n\n1:19:08.300 --> 1:19:09.580\n in their search for justice\n\n1:19:09.580 --> 1:19:11.860\n and how many rules they're willing to break\n\n1:19:11.860 --> 1:19:14.180\n so long as they can say they're after justice\n\n1:19:14.180 --> 1:19:16.220\n and how many norms they can trample\n\n1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:18.500\n so long as they can say it's in the name of justice.\n\n1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:21.420\n You can burn down buildings in the name of justice.\n\n1:19:21.420 --> 1:19:23.700\n Well, the majority groups throughout history,\n\n1:19:23.700 --> 1:19:25.620\n including those with white skin color\n\n1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:28.260\n have done the same in the name of justice.\n\n1:19:28.260 --> 1:19:31.100\n We come up with all kinds of sexy terms\n\n1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:32.420\n in our propaganda machines\n\n1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:35.500\n to sell whatever atrocities we'd like to commit.\n\n1:19:36.580 --> 1:19:40.100\n One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked\n\n1:19:40.100 --> 1:19:41.180\n and I quoted in this book.\n\n1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:43.060\n Careful, I'm judging you harshly.\n\n1:19:43.060 --> 1:19:43.900\n Yeah, of course.\n\n1:19:43.900 --> 1:19:48.900\n Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment\n\n1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:52.980\n is they'll achieve their ultimate form of revenge,\n\n1:19:52.980 --> 1:19:54.660\n which is to turn happy people\n\n1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:57.380\n into unhappy people like themselves,\n\n1:19:57.380 --> 1:19:59.780\n to shove their misery in the faces of the happy\n\n1:19:59.780 --> 1:20:01.380\n so that in due course the happy,\n\n1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:02.660\n and this is quoting Nietzsche,\n\n1:20:02.660 --> 1:20:05.300\n start to be ashamed of their happiness\n\n1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:06.780\n and perhaps say to one another,\n\n1:20:06.780 --> 1:20:08.900\n it's a disgrace to be happy.\n\n1:20:08.900 --> 1:20:11.060\n There is too much misery.\n\n1:20:11.060 --> 1:20:12.220\n This is something to be averted.\n\n1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:15.980\n The sick, says Nietzsche, must not make the healthy sick too\n\n1:20:15.980 --> 1:20:20.060\n or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick.\n\n1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:24.100\n Well, I think that again, there's a lot of that going on.\n\n1:20:24.100 --> 1:20:27.060\n How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world?\n\n1:20:27.060 --> 1:20:29.660\n Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy?\n\n1:20:31.100 --> 1:20:34.140\n I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well.\n\n1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:34.980\n Sure.\n\n1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:36.300\n Knows From Underground.\n\n1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:37.140\n Okay.\n\n1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:41.580\n This has been very Russian, Russian focus.\n\n1:20:41.580 --> 1:20:43.500\n I'm very pleased with another times,\n\n1:20:43.500 --> 1:20:46.340\n but Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in.\n\n1:20:46.340 --> 1:20:49.020\n I wasn't doing this as a sort of.\n\n1:20:49.020 --> 1:20:51.940\n Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats\n\n1:20:53.980 --> 1:20:56.100\n and get to know they're still relevant.\n\n1:20:57.060 --> 1:20:59.780\n Do you speak Russian by the way at all?\n\n1:20:59.780 --> 1:21:00.820\n Which I did.\n\n1:21:00.820 --> 1:21:02.980\n I'm told it's a 10 year language basically\n\n1:21:02.980 --> 1:21:06.060\n to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it.\n\n1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:09.580\n Well, there's the language and then there's the personality\n\n1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:11.300\n behind the language and the personality.\n\n1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:12.940\n I feel like you already have.\n\n1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:15.100\n So you just need to know the surface details.\n\n1:21:15.100 --> 1:21:18.420\n Okay.\n\n1:21:18.420 --> 1:21:22.780\n In fact, the silence to be silent in the Russian language\n\n1:21:22.780 --> 1:21:24.780\n is something that's already important.\n\n1:21:24.780 --> 1:21:25.940\n Oh, I should, if we had a moment,\n\n1:21:25.940 --> 1:21:28.140\n I'd tell you my story about Stalin's birthplace.\n\n1:21:28.140 --> 1:21:28.980\n Should I tell you that?\n\n1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:29.820\n No.\n\n1:21:29.820 --> 1:21:31.900\n I once went to Gori where Stalin was born.\n\n1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:33.900\n Have you been?\n\n1:21:33.900 --> 1:21:34.740\n No, no.\n\n1:21:34.740 --> 1:21:36.660\n I was there just after the Georgia war.\n\n1:21:36.660 --> 1:21:41.420\n And I went to the nomads land in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\n1:21:42.660 --> 1:21:47.300\n And I said, I really got to go to Gori also here\n\n1:21:47.300 --> 1:21:49.420\n because the shell had landed in Gori rather weirdly\n\n1:21:49.420 --> 1:21:53.300\n from the Russian side and Gori is where Stalin was born.\n\n1:21:53.300 --> 1:21:55.580\n And of course, Gori is in Georgia.\n\n1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:59.420\n And when we had the museum of Stalin's birthplace,\n\n1:21:59.420 --> 1:22:01.620\n they'd been trying to change for some years\n\n1:22:01.620 --> 1:22:06.620\n because it had been unadulteratedly pro Stalin for years.\n\n1:22:06.660 --> 1:22:07.740\n And the Georgian authorities,\n\n1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:11.780\n this is in Saakashvili's time,\n\n1:22:11.780 --> 1:22:14.700\n were trying to make it into a museum of Stalinism.\n\n1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:17.420\n And it was really tough.\n\n1:22:17.420 --> 1:22:19.020\n The only place I've seen which is similar\n\n1:22:19.020 --> 1:22:22.020\n is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed.\n\n1:22:23.140 --> 1:22:25.660\n That also is that they're not quite sure to do.\n\n1:22:25.660 --> 1:22:27.940\n They don't want to say he's a bad guy\n\n1:22:27.940 --> 1:22:30.940\n because they think that people won't come anyhow.\n\n1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:32.420\n Stalin's house in Gori had changed\n\n1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:34.180\n from the museum of Stalin to the museum of Stalinism.\n\n1:22:34.180 --> 1:22:37.180\n There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil\n\n1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:40.740\n who just had clearly been doing the tour for 50 years\n\n1:22:40.740 --> 1:22:41.940\n and just pointed all the facts.\n\n1:22:41.940 --> 1:22:43.020\n She did that classic thing.\n\n1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:44.820\n I've also saw it once in North Korea\n\n1:22:44.820 --> 1:22:47.780\n where they sort of that sort of communist thing\n\n1:22:47.780 --> 1:22:51.540\n where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high\n\n1:22:51.540 --> 1:22:52.860\n by 13 feet deep.\n\n1:22:52.860 --> 1:22:53.900\n They give you lots of facts.\n\n1:22:53.900 --> 1:22:55.020\n I don't care.\n\n1:22:55.020 --> 1:22:56.580\n What does it matter?\n\n1:22:56.580 --> 1:22:58.780\n They always give you facts.\n\n1:22:58.780 --> 1:23:00.180\n This is Stalin's suitcase.\n\n1:23:00.180 --> 1:23:04.620\n It is 13 inches wide by, you know, this isn't.\n\n1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:06.740\n Anyhow, and this woman did all of this\n\n1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:09.540\n and it was all just wildly pro, not pro Stalin,\n\n1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:10.660\n just explaining Stalin's life.\n\n1:23:10.660 --> 1:23:13.780\n It was just a great local boy done good.\n\n1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:14.980\n They didn't mention the fact he killed\n\n1:23:14.980 --> 1:23:17.180\n more Georgians per capita than anyone else.\n\n1:23:17.180 --> 1:23:18.780\n Local boy done good.\n\n1:23:18.780 --> 1:23:23.260\n And we get to the end and before being taken to the gift shop\n\n1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:25.700\n where they sell red wine with Stalin's face on it\n\n1:23:25.700 --> 1:23:30.260\n and among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it,\n\n1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:35.260\n they took you to a little room under the stairs\n\n1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:38.940\n and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell\n\n1:23:38.940 --> 1:23:43.940\n to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time.\n\n1:23:44.420 --> 1:23:45.740\n Now, gift shop.\n\n1:23:45.740 --> 1:23:48.540\n As I said, there's no, no kind of thing.\n\n1:23:48.540 --> 1:23:50.740\n And I took the woman aside at the end.\n\n1:23:50.740 --> 1:23:52.500\n I discovered she'd said this to other journalists\n\n1:23:52.500 --> 1:23:53.740\n and visited before.\n\n1:23:53.740 --> 1:23:54.900\n I took her aside and said,\n\n1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:57.820\n what do you think about communist Stalin?\n\n1:23:57.820 --> 1:24:01.060\n And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this\n\n1:24:01.060 --> 1:24:03.460\n during communist times.\n\n1:24:03.460 --> 1:24:08.460\n She said, it's not my place to judge, that sort of thing.\n\n1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:10.780\n Which is an interesting comment in itself.\n\n1:24:10.780 --> 1:24:12.980\n I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone\n\n1:24:12.980 --> 1:24:15.180\n and all that sort of thing.\n\n1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.980\n And she said, it's not my place to judge\n\n1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:19.020\n or to give my views and that sort of thing.\n\n1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:22.340\n And eventually I said, well, what do you feel about it?\n\n1:24:22.340 --> 1:24:27.340\n And she said, it was like a hurricane, it happened.\n\n1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:32.860\n That's interesting because if I may mention Clubhouse\n\n1:24:32.860 --> 1:24:35.900\n once again, I got a chance to talk to a few people\n\n1:24:35.900 --> 1:24:39.100\n from Mongolia, there's a woman from Mongolia\n\n1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:40.660\n and they talked about the fact\n\n1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:43.500\n that they deeply admire Stalin, love.\n\n1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:46.940\n She sounded, if I may, hopefully that's not crossing line.\n\n1:24:46.940 --> 1:24:50.180\n I think I'm representing her correctly in saying\n\n1:24:50.180 --> 1:24:55.060\n she admired him almost like, loved him.\n\n1:24:55.060 --> 1:25:00.060\n Like the way people love like Jesus, like a holy figure.\n\n1:25:00.100 --> 1:25:02.820\n Well, isn't that still the case in large parts of Russia?\n\n1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:04.580\n I mean, Stalin keeps on winning\n\n1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:06.060\n greatest Russian of all time.\n\n1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:10.300\n And that's perhaps, maybe there's a dip,\n\n1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:12.940\n but if we were to think about the long arc of history,\n\n1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:16.220\n perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up.\n\n1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:18.540\n There's something about human memory\n\n1:25:18.540 --> 1:25:20.740\n that it just, you forget the details\n\n1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:22.820\n of the atrocities of the past and remember that.\n\n1:25:22.820 --> 1:25:25.060\n I mean, think of the number of people we talk about\n\n1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:27.580\n as historical heroes, Napoleon.\n\n1:25:27.580 --> 1:25:30.420\n I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero,\n\n1:25:30.420 --> 1:25:35.420\n but the French, now you're, now you're on tricky ground.\n\n1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:42.100\n But no, but like the French, normally my Napoleon\n\n1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:44.740\n and there had many Admiral Aswit who was also\n\n1:25:44.740 --> 1:25:49.340\n an unbelievable brute and killed many people unnecessarily.\n\n1:25:49.340 --> 1:25:51.740\n And there are lots of figures from history\n\n1:25:51.740 --> 1:25:53.980\n that we sort of cover that over with.\n\n1:25:56.740 --> 1:25:58.540\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:25:58.540 --> 1:26:00.300\n Can we mention Churchill briefly?\n\n1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:05.300\n Because he is one of the, you can make a case for him\n\n1:26:06.140 --> 1:26:08.700\n being one of the great representers\n\n1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:12.260\n or great figures historically of Western civilization.\n\n1:26:12.260 --> 1:26:16.820\n And then there's a lot of people from, not a lot.\n\n1:26:16.820 --> 1:26:18.460\n I know, I have like three friends\n\n1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.260\n and one of them happens to be from London.\n\n1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:26.260\n And they say that he's not a good person.\n\n1:26:26.620 --> 1:26:27.460\n Why?\n\n1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:30.420\n So listen, this friend, we did not discuss.\n\n1:26:30.420 --> 1:26:33.180\n I just, this is an opinion poll of the three friends,\n\n1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:35.340\n but I do know that there's quite a bit, you know.\n\n1:26:35.340 --> 1:26:37.180\n There's a backlash going on at the moment.\n\n1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:39.220\n At the moment and in general, there's a spirit\n\n1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:42.300\n like reflecting on the darker sides\n\n1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:43.660\n of some of these historical figures,\n\n1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:46.660\n like challenging history through,\n\n1:26:46.660 --> 1:26:48.340\n it's not just critical race theory.\n\n1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:52.020\n It's challenging history through,\n\n1:26:52.020 --> 1:26:57.020\n well, are the people we think of as heroes,\n\n1:26:57.940 --> 1:26:59.340\n what are their flaws?\n\n1:26:59.340 --> 1:27:02.980\n And are they in fact villains that are convenient,\n\n1:27:02.980 --> 1:27:07.980\n sort of, we're there at the right time\n\n1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:12.020\n to accidentally do the right thing.\n\n1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:13.100\n Accidentally?\n\n1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:19.460\n I hope this isn't the representative fair summation\n\n1:27:19.460 --> 1:27:21.260\n of your friend in London's views.\n\n1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:23.660\n No, she's going to be quite mad at this,\n\n1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:26.180\n but I didn't say the name, so it could be any friend.\n\n1:27:26.180 --> 1:27:28.740\n It could be, it's like a girlfriend in Canada.\n\n1:27:28.740 --> 1:27:30.580\n Well, see, I.\n\n1:27:30.580 --> 1:27:31.700\n You've given that away.\n\n1:27:31.700 --> 1:27:34.860\n Well, that's, of course I would not.\n\n1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:36.140\n I made that up completely.\n\n1:27:36.140 --> 1:27:39.660\n It's all, just like my girlfriend in Canada,\n\n1:27:39.660 --> 1:27:41.780\n she's completely a figment of my imagination.\n\n1:27:41.780 --> 1:27:46.300\n Nevertheless, Winston Churchill is somebody,\n\n1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:48.140\n I mean, just looking at reading\n\n1:27:48.140 --> 1:27:49.340\n The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\n\n1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:53.540\n is an incredible figure that to me,\n\n1:27:55.180 --> 1:27:58.340\n so much of World War II is marked,\n\n1:27:58.340 --> 1:27:59.980\n leading up to the war is marked\n\n1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:03.740\n by stunning amounts of cowardice by political leaders,\n\n1:28:03.740 --> 1:28:07.380\n and it's fascinating to watch here\n\n1:28:07.380 --> 1:28:11.420\n this person clearly with a drinking and a smoking problem.\n\n1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:12.260\n Was he?\n\n1:28:12.260 --> 1:28:13.980\n I didn't understand why that's a negative.\n\n1:28:13.980 --> 1:28:15.700\n No, I didn't say, you see.\n\n1:28:15.700 --> 1:28:17.860\n Yeah, you throw it in as if it is.\n\n1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.700\n No, well, it's called humor.\n\n1:28:19.700 --> 1:28:21.460\n I'll explain it to you one day what that means,\n\n1:28:21.460 --> 1:28:22.900\n but he stood.\n\n1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:23.940\n Explain dry humor.\n\n1:28:23.940 --> 1:28:28.940\n He stood up, he stood up to what we now see as evil\n\n1:28:31.980 --> 1:28:34.860\n when at the time it was not so obvious to see.\n\n1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:39.820\n You know, so that's just a fascinating figure\n\n1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:40.780\n of Western civilization.\n\n1:28:40.780 --> 1:28:42.220\n I'd love to get your comments.\n\n1:28:42.220 --> 1:28:45.380\n The real criticisms, I mean, smoking and drinking.\n\n1:28:45.380 --> 1:28:49.180\n The real criticisms of Churchill are quite easy to sum up,\n\n1:28:49.180 --> 1:28:50.860\n and I do so in the War on the West, actually.\n\n1:28:50.860 --> 1:28:54.060\n I say these are the things that they now use against him.\n\n1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:56.860\n Didn't do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943,\n\n1:28:56.860 --> 1:28:57.700\n for instance.\n\n1:28:57.700 --> 1:28:59.580\n That's been shot down by numerous historians,\n\n1:28:59.580 --> 1:29:01.660\n including Indian historians.\n\n1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:04.140\n In the middle of the war, in the middle of a world war,\n\n1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:05.260\n Churchill did what he could\n\n1:29:05.260 --> 1:29:10.260\n to get grain supplies diverted from Australia to Bengal.\n\n1:29:12.380 --> 1:29:13.820\n The famine was appalling.\n\n1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:15.020\n It was caused by a typhoon.\n\n1:29:15.020 --> 1:29:17.700\n It was not caused by Winston Churchill,\n\n1:29:17.700 --> 1:29:22.060\n and the idea that some, basically,\n\n1:29:22.060 --> 1:29:24.260\n Indian nationalist historians have pumped out\n\n1:29:24.260 --> 1:29:28.140\n in recent years, and just anti Churchill figures,\n\n1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:31.140\n that he actually wanted Indians to die\n\n1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:34.380\n is just total calumny.\n\n1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:36.260\n And when people claim, some people claim that,\n\n1:29:36.260 --> 1:29:39.220\n I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars,\n\n1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:41.820\n nevertheless with some credentials,\n\n1:29:41.820 --> 1:29:45.020\n who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population\n\n1:29:45.020 --> 1:29:47.260\n to basically be genocided.\n\n1:29:47.260 --> 1:29:48.500\n And it's complete nonsense,\n\n1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:51.220\n not least by the fact that during the period\n\n1:29:51.220 --> 1:29:54.620\n which in question Indian population boomed.\n\n1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:59.660\n So that's one of the main ones.\n\n1:29:59.660 --> 1:30:02.100\n Another one is that he had some views\n\n1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:03.420\n that we now had regarded as racist.\n\n1:30:03.420 --> 1:30:04.660\n He definitely regarded races\n\n1:30:04.660 --> 1:30:07.740\n as being of different characters,\n\n1:30:07.740 --> 1:30:10.260\n and that there were superior races,\n\n1:30:10.260 --> 1:30:13.380\n and the, as it were, the white European\n\n1:30:13.380 --> 1:30:18.380\n was a superior culture.\n\n1:30:19.420 --> 1:30:21.780\n He was born in Victorian England,\n\n1:30:21.780 --> 1:30:23.540\n so he had some Victorian attitudes.\n\n1:30:26.060 --> 1:30:28.140\n These are things in the negative side of the ledger,\n\n1:30:28.140 --> 1:30:29.700\n and as with all history,\n\n1:30:29.700 --> 1:30:30.540\n you should have a negative\n\n1:30:30.540 --> 1:30:31.900\n and a positive side of the ledger.\n\n1:30:31.900 --> 1:30:33.220\n Positive side of the ledger includes\n\n1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:35.260\n he almost certainly did more than any one human being\n\n1:30:35.260 --> 1:30:37.260\n to save the world from Nazism.\n\n1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:39.460\n So that should count as something.\n\n1:30:39.460 --> 1:30:41.220\n And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill\n\n1:30:41.220 --> 1:30:45.180\n in this regard is to stress that if you get,\n\n1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:49.580\n I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all.\n\n1:30:49.580 --> 1:30:51.700\n I don't think that the revisionism of recent years\n\n1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:53.940\n about Churchill or the founding fathers of America\n\n1:30:53.940 --> 1:30:56.940\n or anyone else is anything I want to stop.\n\n1:30:56.940 --> 1:30:58.220\n I find it interesting,\n\n1:30:58.220 --> 1:30:59.180\n find it interesting not least\n\n1:30:59.180 --> 1:31:00.500\n because it's so sloppy on occasions,\n\n1:31:00.500 --> 1:31:02.220\n but I find it interesting and it's important.\n\n1:31:02.220 --> 1:31:04.700\n And we should be able to see people in the round.\n\n1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:08.340\n But that includes recognizing\n\n1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:10.500\n the positive side of the ledger.\n\n1:31:10.500 --> 1:31:13.700\n And if you can't recognize that side,\n\n1:31:13.700 --> 1:31:15.740\n you're doing something else.\n\n1:31:15.740 --> 1:31:16.940\n You're doing something else.\n\n1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:18.580\n It's not history.\n\n1:31:18.580 --> 1:31:23.380\n It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind.\n\n1:31:23.380 --> 1:31:26.060\n And I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers.\n\n1:31:26.060 --> 1:31:27.220\n There are some people, for instance,\n\n1:31:27.220 --> 1:31:29.660\n certainly since the 90s who have pushed\n\n1:31:29.660 --> 1:31:32.820\n the Sally Hemings, Thomas Jefferson story\n\n1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:35.540\n to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute.\n\n1:31:35.540 --> 1:31:39.740\n As a result, we see Jefferson's statue\n\n1:31:39.740 --> 1:31:41.180\n being removed from the council chamber\n\n1:31:41.180 --> 1:31:43.380\n of the city we're sitting in last November\n\n1:31:43.380 --> 1:31:45.660\n by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson\n\n1:31:45.660 --> 1:31:47.660\n no longer represents our values.\n\n1:31:47.660 --> 1:31:51.460\n If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson\n\n1:31:51.460 --> 1:31:53.220\n and that he had flaws,\n\n1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:58.580\n I mean, that's not a grownup debate.\n\n1:31:58.580 --> 1:32:01.380\n And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time.\n\n1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:05.900\n But let me sort of throw a curveball at you then.\n\n1:32:05.900 --> 1:32:08.460\n What about recognizing the positive\n\n1:32:08.460 --> 1:32:11.060\n and the negative of a fellow with nice facial hair\n\n1:32:11.060 --> 1:32:13.060\n called Karl Marx?\n\n1:32:13.060 --> 1:32:14.420\n Sure, sure.\n\n1:32:14.420 --> 1:32:17.900\n I mean, I have a section in The War in the West,\n\n1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:20.540\n as you know, where I go for Karl Marx with some glee.\n\n1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:26.380\n So he seems to have gotten some popularity\n\n1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:29.100\n in the West recently.\n\n1:32:29.100 --> 1:32:30.660\n Not just recently, yeah.\n\n1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:32.700\n I mean, he's had a resurgence recently.\n\n1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:33.820\n Yes, resurgence.\n\n1:32:33.820 --> 1:32:36.940\n Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong,\n\n1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:39.820\n people reach for other options.\n\n1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:42.420\n And when, for instance, it's very hard\n\n1:32:42.420 --> 1:32:43.700\n for people to accumulate capital,\n\n1:32:43.700 --> 1:32:46.660\n it's not obvious that they're gonna become capitalists.\n\n1:32:46.660 --> 1:32:49.100\n And so one thing that happens is people say,\n\n1:32:49.100 --> 1:32:50.660\n let's look at the Marxism thing again,\n\n1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:52.820\n see if that's a viable goer.\n\n1:32:52.820 --> 1:32:55.620\n And my argument would simply be,\n\n1:32:55.620 --> 1:32:58.380\n point me to one place that's worked.\n\n1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:01.500\n Well, the argument from the Marxists\n\n1:33:01.500 --> 1:33:05.020\n or the Marxian economists is that\n\n1:33:05.020 --> 1:33:08.540\n we've only really tried it once, the Soviets tried it,\n\n1:33:08.540 --> 1:33:10.420\n and then there's a few people\n\n1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:12.340\n that kind of tried the Soviet thing.\n\n1:33:12.340 --> 1:33:13.740\n Huber tried it?\n\n1:33:13.740 --> 1:33:18.740\n Well, they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet, yes.\n\n1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:19.820\n They've tried it.\n\n1:33:19.820 --> 1:33:21.020\n They tried it in Venezuela.\n\n1:33:22.180 --> 1:33:23.380\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n1:33:23.380 --> 1:33:25.720\n So let's just quickly say,\n\n1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.500\n how did all these experiments go?\n\n1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:31.180\n Well, they failed in fascinating ways.\n\n1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:32.660\n They did, but they failed.\n\n1:33:32.660 --> 1:33:33.500\n Yes, they failed.\n\n1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:36.860\n We should stress, so grossly failed.\n\n1:33:36.860 --> 1:33:39.380\n So grossly failed that they threw millions\n\n1:33:39.380 --> 1:33:43.960\n and millions of people into completely thwarted lives\n\n1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:47.260\n that were much shorter than they should have been.\n\n1:33:47.260 --> 1:33:50.660\n Yeah, so the lesson to learn there,\n\n1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:52.280\n that you can learn several lessons.\n\n1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:56.180\n One is that anything that smells like Marxism\n\n1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:59.900\n is going to lead to a lot of problems.\n\n1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:02.140\n Now, another lesson could be,\n\n1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:05.940\n well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had?\n\n1:34:05.940 --> 1:34:10.420\n He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism.\n\n1:34:10.420 --> 1:34:13.420\n So is it possible to do better than capitalism?\n\n1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:16.740\n And that's, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder.\n\n1:34:16.740 --> 1:34:19.220\n That might actually become relevant in, I don't know,\n\n1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:24.220\n 20, 30, 50 years when the machines start doing\n\n1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:26.620\n more and more of the labor, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:34:26.620 --> 1:34:27.660\n You start to ask questions.\n\n1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.900\n You finally might get to Marx's dream\n\n1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:31.820\n of what the average day would look like.\n\n1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:32.660\n Yes.\n\n1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:35.020\n Well, there's gonna be an awful lot\n\n1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:36.420\n of literary criticism then.\n\n1:34:38.260 --> 1:34:39.740\n If you remember, that's what Marx said\n\n1:34:39.740 --> 1:34:41.260\n that we would be doing in the evenings,\n\n1:34:41.260 --> 1:34:42.580\n the laborer in the evening.\n\n1:34:42.580 --> 1:34:45.340\n Well, he didn't know Twitter was a thing, or Netflix.\n\n1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:47.740\n So he would change.\n\n1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:51.740\n Are there things we could learn from Marx plausibly, possibly?\n\n1:34:51.740 --> 1:34:53.840\n I can't think of anything myself offhand.\n\n1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:56.780\n But to have a critique of capitalism\n\n1:34:56.780 --> 1:34:58.940\n isn't by any means a bad thing in this society.\n\n1:34:58.940 --> 1:35:00.780\n I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism\n\n1:35:00.780 --> 1:35:02.820\n that showed how you improve capitalism,\n\n1:35:02.820 --> 1:35:04.580\n a critique of the free market that showed\n\n1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:07.380\n how people could get better access to the free market,\n\n1:35:07.380 --> 1:35:08.700\n how you could ensure, for instance,\n\n1:35:08.700 --> 1:35:10.740\n that young people get onto the property ladder,\n\n1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:11.940\n things like that.\n\n1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:13.180\n Those are constructive things.\n\n1:35:13.180 --> 1:35:15.260\n The people who say we must have Marxism,\n\n1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:17.340\n I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking about,\n\n1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:19.900\n because that never leads to any of those things.\n\n1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:22.020\n Haven't led in the past.\n\n1:35:22.020 --> 1:35:23.020\n It's never led in the past.\n\n1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:25.940\n And at some point, you've got to try to work out\n\n1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:30.300\n how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy\n\n1:35:30.300 --> 1:35:32.540\n before you realize that every attempt always\n\n1:35:32.540 --> 1:35:34.220\n leads to the same thing.\n\n1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:36.740\n I would say we could pretend that fascism has never\n\n1:35:36.740 --> 1:35:41.940\n been properly tried and that it was unfortunate what happened\n\n1:35:41.940 --> 1:35:45.820\n in Nazi Germany, but that wasn't real fascism.\n\n1:35:45.820 --> 1:35:49.540\n And Mussolini's fascism didn't go all that well,\n\n1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:51.300\n but it was a bit better.\n\n1:35:51.300 --> 1:35:54.580\n And maybe we could try a bit more Franco fascism.\n\n1:35:54.580 --> 1:35:58.660\n Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they.\n\n1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:02.120\n The people who try that are reviled, and quite rightly.\n\n1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:04.660\n So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing?\n\n1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:06.780\n And it's a great mystery to me,\n\n1:36:06.780 --> 1:36:08.740\n the way that people do tolerate it.\n\n1:36:08.740 --> 1:36:11.860\n Always, always in this stupid way of saying,\n\n1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:13.900\n we haven't done it yet.\n\n1:36:13.900 --> 1:36:16.220\n And if you keep trying the same recipe,\n\n1:36:16.220 --> 1:36:19.140\n and every time it comes out as shit,\n\n1:36:19.140 --> 1:36:21.260\n it's that the recipe is shit.\n\n1:36:21.260 --> 1:36:23.420\n Well, sort of, I'm trying to practice here\n\n1:36:23.420 --> 1:36:24.460\n by playing devil's advocate,\n\n1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:26.460\n practice the same idea that you mentioned,\n\n1:36:26.460 --> 1:36:29.340\n which is, when you say the word Marxism,\n\n1:36:29.340 --> 1:36:30.700\n should you throw out everything,\n\n1:36:30.700 --> 1:36:33.660\n or should you ask a question, is there good ideas here?\n\n1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:36.460\n And the same, it's the good,\n\n1:36:36.460 --> 1:36:37.780\n it's weighing the good and the bad,\n\n1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:40.660\n and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully.\n\n1:36:40.660 --> 1:36:41.820\n Sure.\n\n1:36:41.820 --> 1:36:45.580\n You know the famous George Orwell comment\n\n1:36:45.580 --> 1:36:48.780\n on the style, in an argument with a Stalinist?\n\n1:36:48.780 --> 1:36:49.620\n Do you know this?\n\n1:36:49.620 --> 1:36:51.380\n That's one of my favorite quotes.\n\n1:36:51.380 --> 1:36:52.820\n George Orwell, in the early 40s,\n\n1:36:52.820 --> 1:36:55.900\n gets into an argument with a Stalinist.\n\n1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:57.020\n He's also a Marxist.\n\n1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:02.900\n And this is after the show trials, 37.\n\n1:37:04.020 --> 1:37:06.500\n This is when it's very clear\n\n1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:09.940\n what Marxism in the Russian form is.\n\n1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:15.260\n And this, Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist,\n\n1:37:15.260 --> 1:37:16.580\n and it goes on and on,\n\n1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.980\n and eventually Orwell says,\n\n1:37:18.980 --> 1:37:20.580\n well, you know, what about the show trials,\n\n1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:23.060\n and what about what's happened in the Ukraine,\n\n1:37:23.060 --> 1:37:26.540\n and the famines, and much more,\n\n1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:29.140\n and the purges, and the purges, and the purges,\n\n1:37:29.140 --> 1:37:33.060\n and eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell\n\n1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:35.460\n what Orwell knows he's going to say all along,\n\n1:37:35.460 --> 1:37:36.300\n which is, he says,\n\n1:37:36.300 --> 1:37:39.300\n you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.\n\n1:37:40.180 --> 1:37:42.940\n And Orwell says, where's the omelet?\n\n1:37:46.060 --> 1:37:49.580\n Oh, yeah, that's a good, that's a really good,\n\n1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:50.420\n because that's a...\n\n1:37:50.420 --> 1:37:52.540\n Look at this by this stage, okay?\n\n1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:53.380\n How many...\n\n1:37:53.380 --> 1:37:54.580\n Where's my damn omelet?\n\n1:37:54.580 --> 1:37:59.580\n How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles\n\n1:38:00.060 --> 1:38:04.660\n have the Marxists created by now in country after country?\n\n1:38:04.660 --> 1:38:05.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:05.500 --> 1:38:08.780\n Always next time they're going to produce the great omelet,\n\n1:38:08.780 --> 1:38:11.460\n but they never have, and they never will,\n\n1:38:11.460 --> 1:38:14.620\n because the whole thing is rotten from the start.\n\n1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:17.500\n But let me just also say one thing about,\n\n1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:20.700\n because of course Marx isn't as nice as he sounds,\n\n1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:22.860\n and that's one of the things that I try\n\n1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:24.180\n to highlight in the book is,\n\n1:38:24.180 --> 1:38:25.940\n if we're going to do this reductive thing\n\n1:38:25.940 --> 1:38:26.940\n of people in history and saying,\n\n1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:29.500\n well, they had views that were of their time,\n\n1:38:29.500 --> 1:38:32.020\n and we must therefore condemn them for them,\n\n1:38:32.020 --> 1:38:34.180\n say, fine, let's do the same thing with Marx.\n\n1:38:34.180 --> 1:38:35.740\n And there were things I quote in this book\n\n1:38:35.740 --> 1:38:38.420\n from Marx's letters, not least letters to Engels,\n\n1:38:38.420 --> 1:38:40.740\n and indeed in his published writings,\n\n1:38:40.740 --> 1:38:43.020\n in pieces he was writing for the American press\n\n1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:46.020\n in the 1850s,\n\n1:38:47.220 --> 1:38:49.940\n the way he has horrible views on slavery\n\n1:38:49.940 --> 1:38:52.980\n and colonialism and much more.\n\n1:38:53.860 --> 1:38:54.780\n But the main thing is, I mean,\n\n1:38:54.780 --> 1:38:57.660\n the horrible things he says about black people\n\n1:38:57.660 --> 1:38:59.460\n and the constant use of the N word.\n\n1:38:59.460 --> 1:39:00.780\n In fact, when I was doing the audio book\n\n1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:03.380\n for the war in the West, I had to decide,\n\n1:39:03.380 --> 1:39:05.740\n will I read out the quotes from Marx or not?\n\n1:39:05.740 --> 1:39:08.900\n If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled\n\n1:39:08.900 --> 1:39:11.260\n because people would have just said,\n\n1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:14.460\n you've been using the N word so much in this passage.\n\n1:39:14.460 --> 1:39:17.660\n And I slightly thought of doing it\n\n1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:20.620\n so that I could say I was only quoting Marx\n\n1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:22.420\n to try to hit the point home.\n\n1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:24.260\n In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to,\n\n1:39:24.260 --> 1:39:27.540\n but Marx's letters are disgusting on these terms.\n\n1:39:27.540 --> 1:39:29.380\n Since I highlighted this in this book\n\n1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:31.380\n and some of the media picked it up\n\n1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:35.780\n and have popularized this thing\n\n1:39:35.780 --> 1:39:37.340\n I'm trying to put into the system,\n\n1:39:37.340 --> 1:39:39.420\n which is if you're gonna accuse Churchill of racism,\n\n1:39:39.420 --> 1:39:41.580\n if you're gonna accuse Jefferson of racism,\n\n1:39:41.580 --> 1:39:44.220\n Washington of racism, and so on, what about Marx?\n\n1:39:44.220 --> 1:39:46.660\n The two things that Marxists have said since this came out\n\n1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:49.380\n has been, first of all, why are you saying this about Marx?\n\n1:39:49.380 --> 1:39:54.260\n He was a man of his time, like everyone else.\n\n1:39:54.260 --> 1:39:55.660\n And the second thing they say is,\n\n1:39:55.660 --> 1:39:58.860\n we don't go to Marx for his horrible abhorrent views on race.\n\n1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:01.740\n So talking about mixed race people as gorillas and so on.\n\n1:40:02.900 --> 1:40:04.300\n We don't go to him for that.\n\n1:40:04.300 --> 1:40:06.580\n We go to him for his economic theories.\n\n1:40:06.580 --> 1:40:10.180\n I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson\n\n1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:11.980\n for his views on slaves.\n\n1:40:11.980 --> 1:40:16.980\n We don't go to Churchill for the precise language\n\n1:40:18.820 --> 1:40:21.420\n he used that points in the 1910s about Indians.\n\n1:40:21.420 --> 1:40:22.820\n Or his health advice.\n\n1:40:22.820 --> 1:40:24.620\n Or his health advice.\n\n1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:26.980\n Actually, I do get him for that.\n\n1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:28.620\n That explains so much.\n\n1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:31.780\n But let's have some standards on this.\n\n1:40:31.780 --> 1:40:34.340\n And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact\n\n1:40:34.340 --> 1:40:36.100\n that the people don't do this with Marx\n\n1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:37.140\n because I think what they're trying,\n\n1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:38.380\n what some people are trying to do,\n\n1:40:38.380 --> 1:40:40.060\n and this may sound conspiratorial,\n\n1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:41.500\n but I really don't think it is.\n\n1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:43.540\n I think that some people are deliberately trying\n\n1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.220\n to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past\n\n1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:49.660\n in order to say there's nothing good.\n\n1:40:49.660 --> 1:40:51.100\n Nothing you can hold on to.\n\n1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:52.340\n No one you should revere.\n\n1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:53.820\n You've got no heroes.\n\n1:40:53.820 --> 1:40:55.180\n The whole thing comes down.\n\n1:40:55.180 --> 1:40:56.220\n Who's left standing?\n\n1:40:56.220 --> 1:40:58.460\n Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century\n\n1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:00.500\n still about Marxism.\n\n1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.540\n Well, the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:05.340\n And no, no.\n\n1:41:05.340 --> 1:41:09.740\n You will not have the entire landscape deracinated.\n\n1:41:09.740 --> 1:41:13.060\n And then the worst ideas tried again.\n\n1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:15.100\n So basically destroy all of history\n\n1:41:15.100 --> 1:41:16.580\n and the lessons learned from history\n\n1:41:16.580 --> 1:41:17.860\n and then start from scratch.\n\n1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:20.740\n And then it's completely any idea can work\n\n1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:22.340\n and then you could just take whatever.\n\n1:41:22.340 --> 1:41:24.380\n Well, and the thing is there are always some people\n\n1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:25.940\n with pre preferred ideas.\n\n1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:27.940\n And I mentioned this also with the postcolonialists.\n\n1:41:27.940 --> 1:41:30.660\n The postcolonialists were really interesting\n\n1:41:30.660 --> 1:41:33.300\n because when the European powers were moving\n\n1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:34.820\n from Africa and the Far East,\n\n1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:38.740\n postcolonial movements had one obvious move\n\n1:41:38.740 --> 1:41:41.340\n they could have done, which was to say,\n\n1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:43.260\n since the European powers have left,\n\n1:41:43.260 --> 1:41:46.420\n we will return to a pre colonial life,\n\n1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:48.300\n which in some of their places would have been returning\n\n1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:50.620\n to slave markets and slave ownership\n\n1:41:50.620 --> 1:41:52.500\n and slave selling and much more.\n\n1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:54.300\n But put that aside for a second.\n\n1:41:54.300 --> 1:41:56.300\n They could have said we have an indigenous culture\n\n1:41:56.300 --> 1:41:58.100\n which we will return to.\n\n1:41:58.100 --> 1:42:01.100\n Almost uniformly in the postcolonial era,\n\n1:42:01.100 --> 1:42:04.100\n you had figures like France Fanon,\n\n1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:06.580\n you had European intellectuals like Sartre,\n\n1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:09.780\n who said the Western powers are retreating\n\n1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:12.140\n from these countries and therefore we should institute\n\n1:42:12.140 --> 1:42:14.940\n in these countries what but Western Marxism.\n\n1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:20.020\n Well, it's not obvious to me that like the bad ideas\n\n1:42:20.020 --> 1:42:21.300\n will be the ones that emerge,\n\n1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:23.660\n but it's more likely the bad ideas would emerge\n\n1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:26.540\n in this kind of context when you erase history,\n\n1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:27.380\n when you erase tradition.\n\n1:42:27.380 --> 1:42:30.300\n When you erase history and you leave some ideas\n\n1:42:30.300 --> 1:42:33.500\n deliberately uninterrogated.\n\n1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:37.980\n I mean, as I say, find me one in a hundred\n\n1:42:37.980 --> 1:42:40.180\n American students who've heard of\n\n1:42:42.500 --> 1:42:45.460\n any of the communist despots of the 20th century.\n\n1:42:47.260 --> 1:42:49.500\n I mean, name recognition in,\n\n1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:52.260\n there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK\n\n1:42:52.260 --> 1:42:56.380\n and like name recognition among children,\n\n1:42:56.380 --> 1:43:01.380\n school children for Stalin, let alone Mao.\n\n1:43:01.380 --> 1:43:05.780\n I mean, Mao who kills more people than anyone,\n\n1:43:05.780 --> 1:43:09.500\n 65 million Chinese, perhaps.\n\n1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:13.100\n How many students in America know what Mao was,\n\n1:43:13.100 --> 1:43:16.460\n who he was, where he was, nothing.\n\n1:43:16.460 --> 1:43:17.900\n Or the atrocities committed.\n\n1:43:17.900 --> 1:43:19.340\n Where the atrocities were committed.\n\n1:43:19.340 --> 1:43:21.700\n And I worry about that because it means\n\n1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:24.580\n that we might have learned one of the two lessons\n\n1:43:24.580 --> 1:43:26.100\n of the 20th century.\n\n1:43:26.100 --> 1:43:29.420\n We think we've learned one of the two lessons\n\n1:43:29.420 --> 1:43:30.300\n of the 20th century.\n\n1:43:30.300 --> 1:43:32.060\n We actually haven't learned that lesson.\n\n1:43:32.060 --> 1:43:33.820\n We've learned a little bit of it.\n\n1:43:33.820 --> 1:43:35.780\n And we've not learned the other one at all.\n\n1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:37.660\n Because that's why we still have people\n\n1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:39.340\n in American politics and elsewhere\n\n1:43:39.340 --> 1:43:42.740\n actually talking about collectivization and things.\n\n1:43:42.740 --> 1:43:44.740\n As if there's no problem with that.\n\n1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:46.580\n And as if it's perfectly obvious.\n\n1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:48.100\n And they could run it and they'd know\n\n1:43:48.100 --> 1:43:49.540\n exactly where to stop.\n\n1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:51.420\n What are the two lessons of the 20th century?\n\n1:43:51.420 --> 1:43:52.740\n Fascism and communism.\n\n1:43:55.260 --> 1:43:56.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:56.420 --> 1:44:00.900\n I mean, I'm not exactly sure what exactly the lessons are.\n\n1:44:00.900 --> 1:44:02.020\n No, it's not clear.\n\n1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:03.540\n If the lessons were very clear,\n\n1:44:03.540 --> 1:44:04.900\n we'd be better at it.\n\n1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:08.260\n Well, one is your book broadly applied\n\n1:44:08.260 --> 1:44:10.580\n of madness of crowds.\n\n1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:11.860\n That's one lesson.\n\n1:44:11.860 --> 1:44:14.060\n Well, how so?\n\n1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:19.060\n Meaning like large crowds can display herd like behavior.\n\n1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:21.260\n Yes, be very suspicious of crowds.\n\n1:44:21.260 --> 1:44:22.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:22.100 --> 1:44:24.100\n In general, I mean, you apply it in different,\n\n1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:25.740\n more to modern application.\n\n1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:26.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:29.580\n In a sense, but that's rooted in history,\n\n1:44:29.580 --> 1:44:32.420\n that crowds can, when humans get together,\n\n1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:35.500\n they can do some quite radically silly things.\n\n1:44:35.500 --> 1:44:38.260\n Elias Kaneti is very good on that, crowds and power.\n\n1:44:40.460 --> 1:44:43.940\n And Eric Hoffer, who is a sort of self taught, amazing,\n\n1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:47.900\n not to say autodidactic writer,\n\n1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:49.220\n the true believer and so on.\n\n1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.420\n He was extremely good on that.\n\n1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:52.740\n But the reason I mentioned the two things,\n\n1:44:52.740 --> 1:44:53.860\n no, I mean, we should have realized\n\n1:44:53.860 --> 1:44:57.540\n the two nightmares of the 20th century fascism and communism,\n\n1:44:57.540 --> 1:45:00.020\n that we should know how they came about.\n\n1:45:00.020 --> 1:45:01.220\n And we're interested in learning\n\n1:45:01.220 --> 1:45:03.180\n how one of them came about, fascism.\n\n1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:04.780\n And we know some of the lessons,\n\n1:45:04.780 --> 1:45:08.340\n like don't treat other people as less than you\n\n1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:10.180\n because of their race.\n\n1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:12.140\n That's one lesson.\n\n1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:16.260\n But we've done some good at learning that.\n\n1:45:17.500 --> 1:45:20.580\n But the second one, not to do communism again,\n\n1:45:20.580 --> 1:45:25.580\n not to do socialism, I think we're way away from knowing\n\n1:45:26.540 --> 1:45:29.500\n because we don't know how it happened.\n\n1:45:29.500 --> 1:45:32.620\n And the little temptations are still there always.\n\n1:45:32.620 --> 1:45:33.460\n Look at people saying,\n\n1:45:33.460 --> 1:45:35.700\n I'm gonna expropriate your property.\n\n1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:40.500\n If people do things they don't like,\n\n1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:42.940\n they will get, we can't wait to take your property.\n\n1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:45.780\n Well, there's a sense, there's an appealing sense.\n\n1:45:45.780 --> 1:45:50.780\n Okay, every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it\n\n1:45:50.900 --> 1:45:52.500\n that sells the ideology.\n\n1:45:52.500 --> 1:45:57.140\n So for socialism, for communism is that there's a,\n\n1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:59.740\n it seems unfair that the working class\n\n1:45:59.740 --> 1:46:04.740\n does all of this work and gets only a fraction of the output.\n\n1:46:05.060 --> 1:46:07.020\n It just seems unfair.\n\n1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:07.860\n So you wanna make it.\n\n1:46:07.860 --> 1:46:10.140\n If they do get a fraction of the output, yes.\n\n1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:14.900\n Yes, and so it seems to be more fair\n\n1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:16.260\n if we increase that.\n\n1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:21.260\n If the workers own all of the value of their output\n\n1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:26.500\n and things that are more fair seems to be a good thing.\n\n1:46:26.780 --> 1:46:28.860\n I'd say, well, yeah, I mean, fairness is,\n\n1:46:29.900 --> 1:46:32.460\n I like fairness as a term.\n\n1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:33.820\n No, I much prefer fairness\n\n1:46:33.820 --> 1:46:36.860\n because it's a much easier thing to try to work out.\n\n1:46:36.860 --> 1:46:38.660\n It's quite amorphous itself as a concept,\n\n1:46:38.660 --> 1:46:40.820\n but everyone can recognize it.\n\n1:46:40.820 --> 1:46:45.820\n So for instance, should the boss of the company\n\n1:46:47.100 --> 1:46:51.300\n earn a million times that of the lowest paid employee?\n\n1:46:51.300 --> 1:46:52.420\n Doesn't seem fair.\n\n1:46:53.700 --> 1:46:57.820\n Should they earn maybe five or 10 times\n\n1:46:57.820 --> 1:47:00.620\n the salary of the lowest employee?\n\n1:47:00.620 --> 1:47:03.380\n Yeah, possibly, that could be fair.\n\n1:47:03.380 --> 1:47:05.060\n There are certain sort of multiples\n\n1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:11.060\n which are within the bounds of reasonableness.\n\n1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:17.260\n I think actually that's the much bigger problem\n\n1:47:17.260 --> 1:47:19.220\n in capitalism at the moment as I see it\n\n1:47:19.220 --> 1:47:22.900\n is the not untrue perception\n\n1:47:22.900 --> 1:47:27.900\n that a tiny number of people accrue a lot of the benefits\n\n1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:34.620\n and that the bit in the middle\n\n1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:37.140\n has become increasingly squeezed\n\n1:47:37.140 --> 1:47:38.940\n and is at danger always of falling\n\n1:47:38.940 --> 1:47:40.300\n all the way down to the bottom.\n\n1:47:40.300 --> 1:47:41.780\n I mean, I think in the snakes and ladders\n\n1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:43.460\n of American capitalism, for instance,\n\n1:47:43.460 --> 1:47:46.580\n it's a correct perception to say\n\n1:47:46.580 --> 1:47:50.580\n that the snakes go down awfully far.\n\n1:47:51.700 --> 1:47:53.980\n If you tread on the snake,\n\n1:47:53.980 --> 1:47:56.700\n you can plummet an awfully long way in America.\n\n1:47:56.700 --> 1:48:01.700\n And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high\n\n1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:03.980\n and there's a perception, and again,\n\n1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:07.220\n it's not entirely wrong that the ladder system\n\n1:48:07.220 --> 1:48:08.820\n on the board is kind of broken.\n\n1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:13.460\n So what you're saying is you're a Marxist.\n\n1:48:13.460 --> 1:48:15.460\n I'm not saying I'm a Marxist.\n\n1:48:15.460 --> 1:48:20.460\n You heard that here first in the out of context blog post\n\n1:48:20.460 --> 1:48:21.460\n you're going to write about this.\n\n1:48:21.460 --> 1:48:22.820\n I get to that, I get back to this point.\n\n1:48:22.820 --> 1:48:24.740\n The way to critique capitalism,\n\n1:48:24.740 --> 1:48:28.100\n if it's gone bad, is to get better capitalists.\n\n1:48:28.100 --> 1:48:31.300\n Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair.\n\n1:48:31.300 --> 1:48:35.060\n Never decide that the answer is the thing\n\n1:48:35.060 --> 1:48:39.580\n that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism.\n\n1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:41.900\n So as you describe in The Madness of Crowds\n\n1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:45.580\n the herd like behavior of humans that gets us into trouble,\n\n1:48:47.900 --> 1:48:51.900\n you as an individual thinker and others listening to this,\n\n1:48:51.900 --> 1:48:54.980\n how can you, because all of us are mids crowds,\n\n1:48:54.980 --> 1:48:57.820\n we're influenced by the society that's around us,\n\n1:48:57.820 --> 1:48:59.140\n by the people that's around us.\n\n1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:00.740\n How can we think independently?\n\n1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:06.740\n How can we, if you're in the Soviet Union\n\n1:49:09.580 --> 1:49:11.420\n at the beginning of the 20th century,\n\n1:49:12.420 --> 1:49:16.940\n if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany\n\n1:49:16.940 --> 1:49:18.980\n at the end of the 30s or the 40s,\n\n1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:20.660\n how can you think independently?\n\n1:49:20.660 --> 1:49:25.660\n Given, first of all, that it's hard to think independently,\n\n1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:28.540\n just intellectually speaking,\n\n1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:33.540\n but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous.\n\n1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:36.780\n So the incentive to think independently\n\n1:49:36.780 --> 1:49:40.180\n under the uncertainty that's usually involved with thinking\n\n1:49:40.180 --> 1:49:42.860\n is, I mean, it's a silly thing to say,\n\n1:49:42.860 --> 1:49:44.660\n but on Twitter there is a cost to be paid\n\n1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:49.580\n for going against the crowd on any silly thing.\n\n1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:52.860\n We can even talk about, what is it?\n\n1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:55.620\n Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.\n\n1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:59.060\n There's a crowd that believes that that was unjustified.\n\n1:49:59.060 --> 1:50:00.980\n I forget what the crowd decided.\n\n1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:01.820\n But I don't.\n\n1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:02.700\n Crowd split on that one.\n\n1:50:02.700 --> 1:50:04.620\n It's safe to have one opinion either way.\n\n1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:05.580\n Okay, it is, right.\n\n1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:07.900\n But there is, you put it very nicely,\n\n1:50:07.900 --> 1:50:10.260\n that there's clearly a calculus here\n\n1:50:10.260 --> 1:50:12.620\n and that you can measure, on Twitter in particular,\n\n1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:14.380\n you can measure kind of the crowd,\n\n1:50:14.380 --> 1:50:16.100\n a sense of where the crowd lays.\n\n1:50:16.100 --> 1:50:17.060\n Michael Jackson.\n\n1:50:17.060 --> 1:50:17.900\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:20.660\n Well, oh boy.\n\n1:50:22.420 --> 1:50:26.060\n I don't want to, this is not a legal discussion.\n\n1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:27.980\n I don't have my lawyer present.\n\n1:50:27.980 --> 1:50:29.060\n I don't even have a lawyer.\n\n1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:30.500\n The man in question is dead.\n\n1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:33.860\n But I think most people who are not just diehard fans\n\n1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:35.020\n would concede that Michael Jackson\n\n1:50:35.020 --> 1:50:37.020\n had a strange relationship with children\n\n1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:40.900\n and was almost certainly a pedophile.\n\n1:50:42.060 --> 1:50:45.180\n Is that, was that, did the crowd agree on that?\n\n1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:47.020\n No, the crowd hasn't agreed because he's too famous\n\n1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:48.460\n and we all love Thriller.\n\n1:50:48.460 --> 1:50:49.540\n Yeah, we do.\n\n1:50:49.540 --> 1:50:52.460\n So you said people who are not fans, I just don't.\n\n1:50:52.460 --> 1:50:53.900\n No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson,\n\n1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:56.620\n but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile.\n\n1:50:56.620 --> 1:51:01.500\n And, but nobody wants to give up dancing to bad at weddings.\n\n1:51:01.500 --> 1:51:04.300\n So they just kind of added in.\n\n1:51:04.300 --> 1:51:05.860\n It's fine.\n\n1:51:05.860 --> 1:51:07.340\n Seriously, it's a genius.\n\n1:51:07.340 --> 1:51:10.660\n Your law does not apply to Bill Cosby.\n\n1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:14.340\n Well, he wasn't, he was, of course,\n\n1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:16.660\n one of the most famous people in America.\n\n1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:18.700\n But maybe he wasn't regarded as talented.\n\n1:51:19.580 --> 1:51:22.780\n Oh, oh wow, there's depth to this calculation.\n\n1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:25.060\n There's a genius opt out in all cultures.\n\n1:51:26.140 --> 1:51:27.540\n There's a genius opt out in all cultures.\n\n1:51:27.540 --> 1:51:28.580\n Look at Lord Byron.\n\n1:51:28.580 --> 1:51:30.100\n Lord Byron shagged his sister.\n\n1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:32.820\n Doesn't affect his reputation.\n\n1:51:32.820 --> 1:51:34.900\n In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it.\n\n1:51:34.900 --> 1:51:38.380\n But then again, this kind of war against the West,\n\n1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:41.700\n genius is actually makes you more likely,\n\n1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:43.780\n or no, to get canceled.\n\n1:51:43.780 --> 1:51:47.740\n So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson, or...\n\n1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:50.020\n Well, yes, because if you haven't done anything remarkable,\n\n1:51:50.020 --> 1:51:53.020\n nobody will come looking for you passively, yeah.\n\n1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:56.020\n Oh, so genius can get you in trouble eventually.\n\n1:51:56.020 --> 1:51:58.060\n Sidle through life with nobody noticing.\n\n1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:00.540\n Be totally harmless and then die\n\n1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:02.700\n and hope you haven't used any carbon.\n\n1:52:05.700 --> 1:52:08.980\n But you were asking about how to survive\n\n1:52:08.980 --> 1:52:13.180\n the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds.\n\n1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:15.500\n And there's a very simple answer to that.\n\n1:52:15.500 --> 1:52:20.500\n Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world.\n\n1:52:22.180 --> 1:52:25.260\n Oh, come on, but this is still human psychology.\n\n1:52:25.260 --> 1:52:26.180\n Because you want to fit in.\n\n1:52:26.180 --> 1:52:27.420\n There's a, you want to...\n\n1:52:27.420 --> 1:52:28.860\n Why?\n\n1:52:28.860 --> 1:52:31.860\n Because you like people, and you're just as a...\n\n1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:33.460\n Why not just like a small number of people\n\n1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:34.700\n and ignore the rest?\n\n1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:36.060\n Yeah, that's...\n\n1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:37.300\n That's what I do.\n\n1:52:37.300 --> 1:52:39.620\n Well, I mean, I actually like most people,\n\n1:52:39.620 --> 1:52:40.700\n and that isn't a general thing.\n\n1:52:40.700 --> 1:52:44.420\n I don't have detestation for most people at all.\n\n1:52:44.420 --> 1:52:48.460\n Most people I kind of enjoy speaking with and being with.\n\n1:52:48.460 --> 1:52:52.500\n But in terms of storing your sense of self worth\n\n1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:54.900\n in absolute strangers, big mistake.\n\n1:52:54.900 --> 1:52:56.940\n Yeah, well, me, that's...\n\n1:52:56.940 --> 1:52:58.980\n Listen, let's turn into a therapy session.\n\n1:52:58.980 --> 1:53:01.140\n Because for me, and I think I represent\n\n1:53:01.140 --> 1:53:03.900\n some number of population, is I'm pretty self critical.\n\n1:53:03.900 --> 1:53:06.020\n I'm looking for myself in the world.\n\n1:53:06.020 --> 1:53:09.020\n And there is a depth of connection\n\n1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:10.780\n with people on the internet.\n\n1:53:10.780 --> 1:53:11.620\n I mean, I have some...\n\n1:53:11.620 --> 1:53:13.300\n I think there's a shallowness of it.\n\n1:53:13.300 --> 1:53:14.660\n It's shallow connection.\n\n1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:15.900\n Interesting, I...\n\n1:53:15.900 --> 1:53:16.740\n Put it this way.\n\n1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:21.060\n If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help?\n\n1:53:21.060 --> 1:53:21.900\n On the internet?\n\n1:53:21.900 --> 1:53:22.740\n No, no.\n\n1:53:22.740 --> 1:53:24.140\n Good, that's a good test.\n\n1:53:24.140 --> 1:53:25.100\n Yeah, that's a good test.\n\n1:53:25.100 --> 1:53:27.820\n But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right.\n\n1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:30.020\n Your very close friends would help, family would help.\n\n1:53:30.020 --> 1:53:32.900\n Yeah, and perhaps that's the only thing...\n\n1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:39.220\n You can't store significant amounts of trust,\n\n1:53:39.220 --> 1:53:43.180\n or faith, or belief, or self worth\n\n1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:45.660\n in places which will not return it to you.\n\n1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:49.220\n Okay, so let's talk about the more extreme case,\n\n1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:50.060\n the harsher case.\n\n1:53:50.060 --> 1:53:53.340\n When you talk about the things you talk about\n\n1:53:53.340 --> 1:53:57.940\n in the war on the West and madness of crowds,\n\n1:53:57.940 --> 1:54:02.940\n I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure.\n\n1:54:03.820 --> 1:54:07.300\n As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly.\n\n1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:09.420\n It was a zen like look on your face.\n\n1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:12.180\n So you don't...\n\n1:54:12.180 --> 1:54:14.820\n All you need is Sam Harris to say\n\n1:54:14.820 --> 1:54:16.860\n that you're brilliant and you're happy.\n\n1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:20.340\n No, no, I love Sam.\n\n1:54:20.340 --> 1:54:21.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:21.780 --> 1:54:24.060\n Deeply pleased when he flatters me, but I mean,\n\n1:54:24.060 --> 1:54:27.780\n and he's nice about me, but no, I don't just rely on Sam.\n\n1:54:27.780 --> 1:54:32.460\n No, I mean, why would I mind?\n\n1:54:32.460 --> 1:54:34.180\n I mean, maybe it's self selecting.\n\n1:54:34.180 --> 1:54:37.980\n If I didn't have the view I had about that,\n\n1:54:37.980 --> 1:54:40.780\n or whatever armory it is that I have on that,\n\n1:54:40.780 --> 1:54:42.460\n I wouldn't do what I did, maybe.\n\n1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:45.900\n I mean, have you been to some dark places psychologically\n\n1:54:45.900 --> 1:54:48.980\n because of the challenging ideas you explore?\n\n1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:52.180\n So like significant self doubt, just kind of...\n\n1:54:52.180 --> 1:54:55.500\n I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life.\n\n1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:58.500\n By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind.\n\n1:55:01.100 --> 1:55:02.980\n There's definitely times I've got things wrong\n\n1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:04.180\n and regretted that.\n\n1:55:05.500 --> 1:55:08.180\n There's times I've...\n\n1:55:10.260 --> 1:55:13.700\n There was a period around the time I wrote my book,\n\n1:55:13.700 --> 1:55:15.580\n The Strange Death of Europe,\n\n1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:20.580\n which was a very, very dark time.\n\n1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:25.180\n And it wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life,\n\n1:55:25.180 --> 1:55:27.340\n but because of the book I was writing.\n\n1:55:27.340 --> 1:55:30.180\n Oh, because of the places you had to go\n\n1:55:30.180 --> 1:55:32.220\n in order to write that book.\n\n1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:35.540\n And, well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization.\n\n1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:40.420\n So occasionally now I have maybe slightly too pat\n\n1:55:40.420 --> 1:55:43.580\n at this stage, but sometimes readers come up to me\n\n1:55:43.580 --> 1:55:44.820\n in the street or whatever and say,\n\n1:55:44.820 --> 1:55:47.780\n you know, I love The Strange Death of Europe.\n\n1:55:47.780 --> 1:55:50.700\n And will say, you know, very depressing book to read,\n\n1:55:50.700 --> 1:55:53.020\n however, I would say, well, you should have tried\n\n1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:53.860\n writing it.\n\n1:55:53.860 --> 1:55:58.860\n But it was because, I mean, it has chunks of it,\n\n1:56:01.460 --> 1:56:02.820\n which I'm very proud of in particular\n\n1:56:02.820 --> 1:56:06.980\n about the death of religion, the death of God,\n\n1:56:06.980 --> 1:56:11.740\n the loss of meaning and the void.\n\n1:56:11.740 --> 1:56:14.940\n And that's difficult stuff to write about\n\n1:56:14.940 --> 1:56:17.020\n and to grapple with.\n\n1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:20.660\n And there is a sort of, I haven't reread that book\n\n1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:21.740\n since it came out,\n\n1:56:21.740 --> 1:56:25.340\n but I think there are passages in it\n\n1:56:25.340 --> 1:56:28.260\n which reveal what I was thinking very clearly\n\n1:56:28.260 --> 1:56:33.000\n in the poetry of it, as it were, as well as the detail.\n\n1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:39.860\n But, yeah, I can't say, I'm used to saying\n\n1:56:43.340 --> 1:56:46.180\n what I think and what I see.\n\n1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:49.380\n And if there's any pushback I've got from that,\n\n1:56:49.380 --> 1:56:51.740\n I'm completely consoled that I'm saying what I see\n\n1:56:51.740 --> 1:56:53.040\n with my own eyes.\n\n1:56:54.740 --> 1:56:56.100\n That's your source of strength,\n\n1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:59.540\n is that you're always seeking the truth as best you see it.\n\n1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:03.180\n Well, I can't agree to go along with a lie\n\n1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:05.180\n if I've seen something with my own eyes.\n\n1:57:06.840 --> 1:57:09.320\n Do you ever, so speaking of Sam Harris,\n\n1:57:10.540 --> 1:57:13.340\n and I mentioned to you offline, a lot of people,\n\n1:57:13.340 --> 1:57:16.100\n I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life\n\n1:57:16.100 --> 1:57:18.980\n on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you\n\n1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:22.160\n as their example of a very smart person.\n\n1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:28.300\n So given that compliment, do you ever worry\n\n1:57:29.260 --> 1:57:33.700\n that your sort of ego grows to a level\n\n1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:38.100\n where what you think is the truth is no longer the truth?\n\n1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:43.100\n Is this kind of, it blinds you?\n\n1:57:44.420 --> 1:57:46.620\n And also, on top of that,\n\n1:57:46.620 --> 1:57:50.620\n the fact that you stand against the crowd often,\n\n1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:52.540\n that there's part of it that appeals to you,\n\n1:57:52.540 --> 1:57:56.380\n that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes.\n\n1:57:56.380 --> 1:57:58.540\n I get a certain thrill from the friction.\n\n1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:02.700\n Yeah, that sometimes both your ego\n\n1:58:02.700 --> 1:58:06.100\n and the thrill of friction will get you\n\n1:58:06.100 --> 1:58:08.840\n to deviate from the truth and instead,\n\n1:58:08.840 --> 1:58:10.500\n just look for the friction.\n\n1:58:10.500 --> 1:58:12.380\n Could do, could do for sure.\n\n1:58:13.940 --> 1:58:16.100\n I try to keep alive to that.\n\n1:58:16.100 --> 1:58:20.380\n I mean, early in my career, I realized that, for instance,\n\n1:58:20.380 --> 1:58:24.180\n I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily,\n\n1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:26.420\n any more than strictly necessary,\n\n1:58:26.420 --> 1:58:27.980\n because there was a very large number\n\n1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:30.220\n of already necessary enemies.\n\n1:58:30.220 --> 1:58:31.860\n And I remember once, I won't go into the details,\n\n1:58:31.860 --> 1:58:35.500\n but I already had one sort of thing I'd done that week,\n\n1:58:35.500 --> 1:58:36.540\n and then another thing came out,\n\n1:58:36.540 --> 1:58:39.380\n and I just thought, I can't, I can't do that.\n\n1:58:39.380 --> 1:58:42.340\n And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person\n\n1:58:42.340 --> 1:58:46.220\n who's forever creating storms,\n\n1:58:46.220 --> 1:58:47.980\n and I tried to make sure I wasn't.\n\n1:58:47.980 --> 1:58:51.100\n And I think I've pretty much stuck to that.\n\n1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:52.500\n But to answer your question,\n\n1:58:54.420 --> 1:58:58.660\n well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be\n\n1:58:58.660 --> 1:59:01.500\n that I wouldn't fall into the trap you described.\n\n1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:02.340\n Two reasons.\n\n1:59:03.860 --> 1:59:05.500\n I mean, one is that I don't think of myself\n\n1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:07.220\n as a wildly intelligent person,\n\n1:59:09.100 --> 1:59:11.380\n partly because I'm very, very aware\n\n1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:13.980\n of the things I know nothing about.\n\n1:59:13.980 --> 1:59:17.380\n I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge\n\n1:59:17.380 --> 1:59:22.380\n of the details of finance or economic theory.\n\n1:59:26.340 --> 1:59:28.140\n I mean, the real details.\n\n1:59:28.140 --> 1:59:29.740\n I don't mean the big picture of the kind\n\n1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:30.860\n that we were just discussing earlier,\n\n1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:35.860\n but I have, if you put the periodic table in front of me,\n\n1:59:35.860 --> 1:59:39.420\n the periodic table in front of me,\n\n1:59:39.420 --> 1:59:44.420\n I would struggle to do more than a handful.\n\n1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:52.740\n I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge.\n\n1:59:53.940 --> 1:59:57.020\n And where I have gaps or chasms,\n\n1:59:57.020 --> 1:59:59.300\n I tend to find that I have a disproportionate admiration\n\n1:59:59.300 --> 2:00:01.500\n for the people who know that stuff.\n\n2:00:01.500 --> 2:00:04.540\n Like I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money,\n\n2:00:04.540 --> 2:00:06.060\n really understand it, because I think,\n\n2:00:06.060 --> 2:00:07.460\n how the hell do you do that?\n\n2:00:09.860 --> 2:00:14.780\n And the same thing with biologists, medics,\n\n2:00:14.780 --> 2:00:17.580\n stuff I just know very little about.\n\n2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.580\n And that's a source of humility for you, just knowing that.\n\n2:00:19.580 --> 2:00:21.620\n Yes, I mean, I think, well, I can get on that stuff,\n\n2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:25.300\n but I mean, Jesus, if you got me on the general knowledge.\n\n2:00:25.300 --> 2:00:26.780\n I would say that thing, some years ago,\n\n2:00:26.780 --> 2:00:29.580\n there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge.\n\n2:00:29.580 --> 2:00:34.580\n And I was asked some years ago on to,\n\n2:00:34.660 --> 2:00:36.180\n there's a sort of psych celebrity,\n\n2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:40.100\n one of former students of the universities or colleges\n\n2:00:40.100 --> 2:00:42.420\n asked to go back for the Christmas special.\n\n2:00:42.420 --> 2:00:45.780\n And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college\n\n2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:49.180\n to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one.\n\n2:00:49.180 --> 2:00:50.500\n And the only thing I actually wanted to do,\n\n2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:52.020\n it was go discover the Louis Theroux\n\n2:00:52.020 --> 2:00:53.580\n had been to my college before my time.\n\n2:00:53.580 --> 2:00:55.780\n And he was on, he'd agreed to be on the team.\n\n2:00:55.780 --> 2:00:57.700\n And I thought, well, I'd love to meet Louis Theroux,\n\n2:00:57.700 --> 2:00:58.980\n that'd be great fun.\n\n2:00:58.980 --> 2:01:01.900\n And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don't want to do it.\n\n2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:03.220\n And they said, come on, you'd be great.\n\n2:01:03.220 --> 2:01:05.020\n I said, I wouldn't, I'd show myself up\n\n2:01:05.020 --> 2:01:07.380\n to be a total asshole and ignoramus.\n\n2:01:07.380 --> 2:01:10.780\n And as it was, I sat down my flat\n\n2:01:10.780 --> 2:01:13.980\n and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge.\n\n2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:19.260\n I realized I'd have just sat mute for the whole half hour.\n\n2:01:20.540 --> 2:01:23.220\n I just couldn't, the first question was about physics.\n\n2:01:23.220 --> 2:01:25.980\n And the second one was about, as it was,\n\n2:01:25.980 --> 2:01:29.180\n I watched the one and I could answer the first two\n\n2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:32.180\n or three questions of the one that actually went out\n\n2:01:32.180 --> 2:01:34.260\n because they made it a bit simpler.\n\n2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:37.820\n But I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the,\n\n2:01:37.820 --> 2:01:39.980\n and I said to the producers, I said, I can't go on\n\n2:01:39.980 --> 2:01:42.060\n because I mean, I just couldn't answer the questions.\n\n2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:44.660\n These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer\n\n2:01:44.660 --> 2:01:46.060\n on a whole range of things.\n\n2:01:46.060 --> 2:01:51.060\n So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations and...\n\n2:01:51.340 --> 2:01:53.540\n You contemplate your limitations.\n\n2:01:53.540 --> 2:01:56.300\n Yeah, and they're forever before me, you know.\n\n2:01:56.300 --> 2:01:58.860\n They're not hard to find in every day.\n\n2:01:58.860 --> 2:02:01.660\n And then on top of that, I suppose, it's,\n\n2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:06.660\n in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling's\n\n2:02:08.460 --> 2:02:12.700\n alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem, If?\n\n2:02:13.780 --> 2:02:14.980\n There's a line.\n\n2:02:14.980 --> 2:02:16.940\n You just enjoy a good poem, can you?\n\n2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:21.220\n Well, no, it's not, I can enjoy a great poem.\n\n2:02:21.220 --> 2:02:23.180\n But I mean, a good poem.\n\n2:02:23.180 --> 2:02:25.380\n This is, you know, slightly off.\n\n2:02:25.380 --> 2:02:26.940\n But, well, it's up to you.\n\n2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:29.500\n This goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky.\n\n2:02:29.500 --> 2:02:34.500\n Take Douglas's criticism with a grain of salt, so.\n\n2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:37.700\n Maybe I've read it too many memorial services and things.\n\n2:02:37.700 --> 2:02:41.860\n But that line is a good piece of advice.\n\n2:02:41.860 --> 2:02:44.220\n If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster\n\n2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:48.420\n and greet these two imposters just the same.\n\n2:02:48.420 --> 2:02:49.740\n That's a good line.\n\n2:02:49.740 --> 2:02:50.740\n It's a good line.\n\n2:02:50.740 --> 2:02:53.260\n It's skipping off an amazing turn of line.\n\n2:02:53.260 --> 2:02:56.100\n But I do think that it's a very sensible thing\n\n2:02:56.100 --> 2:03:00.660\n to try to greet triumph and disaster\n\n2:03:00.660 --> 2:03:03.860\n and regard them as imposters and greet them just the same.\n\n2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:07.540\n And actually, anyone who knows me knows that I never,\n\n2:03:08.740 --> 2:03:12.700\n partly it's because I have a sort of belief in the old gods\n\n2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:14.260\n and that the moment that I thought\n\n2:03:14.260 --> 2:03:16.380\n that I was at the moment of triumph,\n\n2:03:16.380 --> 2:03:18.140\n the fates would hitch up their skirts\n\n2:03:18.140 --> 2:03:20.780\n and run at me at a million miles an hour.\n\n2:03:20.780 --> 2:03:25.780\n But it's also because, anyone who knows me knows\n\n2:03:26.100 --> 2:03:28.280\n I never have a moment when I say,\n\n2:03:30.820 --> 2:03:32.460\n that's just great.\n\n2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:37.340\n I feel totally fulfilled and victorious.\n\n2:03:37.340 --> 2:03:39.140\n I mean, it happened to me recently\n\n2:03:39.140 --> 2:03:41.580\n when the war in the West went straight to number one\n\n2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:43.340\n in the bestseller list.\n\n2:03:43.340 --> 2:03:46.140\n How long did that last in terms of your self satisfaction?\n\n2:03:46.140 --> 2:03:47.820\n Didn't happen.\n\n2:03:47.820 --> 2:03:49.100\n Not even for a brief moment?\n\n2:03:49.100 --> 2:03:49.940\n No.\n\n2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:54.020\n When I first saw that it was selling,\n\n2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:55.440\n I had that moment of elation.\n\n2:03:55.440 --> 2:03:58.660\n I thought, good, I've done it, it's out.\n\n2:03:59.540 --> 2:04:03.180\n And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely.\n\n2:04:03.180 --> 2:04:05.180\n But it doesn't last, partly because I tell myself\n\n2:04:05.180 --> 2:04:06.140\n it mustn't last.\n\n2:04:07.100 --> 2:04:12.100\n Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt.\n\n2:04:12.180 --> 2:04:14.180\n Is that skirts?\n\n2:04:14.180 --> 2:04:17.940\n I don't, this, you brits with your poetry,\n\n2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:19.360\n even when it's nauseating.\n\n2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:24.540\n As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis\n\n2:04:24.540 --> 2:04:27.880\n of the political leadership and the human mind\n\n2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:30.800\n and the human being of Donald Trump?\n\n2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:34.540\n I sort of avoided this for years.\n\n2:04:34.540 --> 2:04:35.980\n Just talking about Trump.\n\n2:04:35.980 --> 2:04:37.660\n Tried to avoid talking about Trump for years.\n\n2:04:37.660 --> 2:04:39.700\n Same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit.\n\n2:04:39.700 --> 2:04:41.820\n Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent,\n\n2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:45.740\n do you think that Trump's story is over\n\n2:04:45.740 --> 2:04:47.700\n or are we just done with volume one?\n\n2:04:47.700 --> 2:04:48.540\n I have no idea.\n\n2:04:48.540 --> 2:04:51.000\n The people I know who know him say that he's running.\n\n2:04:53.020 --> 2:04:58.020\n And I think that in general, Republicans have to,\n\n2:04:59.080 --> 2:05:01.000\n do have a choice in front of them.\n\n2:05:02.740 --> 2:05:06.000\n A one friend put it to me recently, said,\n\n2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.420\n you've got to go in with your toughest fighter.\n\n2:05:08.420 --> 2:05:13.420\n And I understand that instinct and I also think\n\n2:05:16.580 --> 2:05:18.580\n it's a very dangerous instinct\n\n2:05:18.580 --> 2:05:20.420\n because what if your toughest fighter\n\n2:05:20.420 --> 2:05:22.160\n is also your biggest liability?\n\n2:05:23.700 --> 2:05:25.460\n What's the best way to get out the Democrat vote\n\n2:05:25.460 --> 2:05:28.060\n in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running?\n\n2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:30.220\n And the people that are doing the war in the West,\n\n2:05:30.220 --> 2:05:32.780\n they're pretty tough fighters.\n\n2:05:32.780 --> 2:05:33.860\n They are.\n\n2:05:33.860 --> 2:05:37.580\n And I'm cautious about this because I know every way\n\n2:05:37.580 --> 2:05:41.100\n I tread it's dangerous, but let me just be frank.\n\n2:05:41.100 --> 2:05:42.500\n Tread gracefully.\n\n2:05:42.500 --> 2:05:44.340\n I'll tread as gracefully as I can.\n\n2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:48.100\n My Wellington boots, my galoshes.\n\n2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:54.620\n Here's the thing, I think everybody knows what Trump is.\n\n2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:56.900\n I think we all knew for years.\n\n2:05:56.900 --> 2:05:59.300\n And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend\n\n2:05:59.300 --> 2:06:02.780\n that he was something he wasn't.\n\n2:06:02.780 --> 2:06:07.540\n I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend\n\n2:06:07.540 --> 2:06:09.820\n that for instance he was some devout Christian\n\n2:06:09.820 --> 2:06:13.860\n or a man of faith or a man of great integrity\n\n2:06:13.860 --> 2:06:16.420\n or all of these sorts of things.\n\n2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:18.540\n Because in the public eye for years,\n\n2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:20.900\n it'd be obvious that wasn't the case.\n\n2:06:20.900 --> 2:06:24.760\n But he has something extraordinary.\n\n2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:28.820\n One thing is a method of communication\n\n2:06:28.820 --> 2:06:32.580\n that you've just got to say was unbelievable.\n\n2:06:32.580 --> 2:06:35.240\n In one fundamental way that you can't look away\n\n2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:36.080\n for some reason.\n\n2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:36.980\n Can't look away.\n\n2:06:36.980 --> 2:06:41.980\n I mean, I mean watching him clear everyone out of the way\n\n2:06:42.460 --> 2:06:45.100\n in 2016 was thrilling\n\n2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:47.980\n because those people needed clearing away.\n\n2:06:47.980 --> 2:06:49.540\n You know, I mean, it's just horrifying.\n\n2:06:49.540 --> 2:06:51.780\n What America is going to give us another Bush?\n\n2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.780\n What's so great about this family?\n\n2:06:57.060 --> 2:06:58.460\n America is going to give us another Clinton.\n\n2:06:58.460 --> 2:07:01.340\n We're going to get to choose any Clinton on the Bush.\n\n2:07:01.340 --> 2:07:03.460\n Mark Stein said, whatever, we'll just wait for the day\n\n2:07:03.460 --> 2:07:05.060\n the Clintons and the Bushes into marry\n\n2:07:05.060 --> 2:07:07.340\n and then we can really have a monarchy again.\n\n2:07:08.700 --> 2:07:12.160\n So I was very pleased to see him clear them away.\n\n2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:16.980\n I was very pleased to see him sort of raise\n\n2:07:16.980 --> 2:07:18.740\n some of the issues that needed raising.\n\n2:07:18.740 --> 2:07:21.100\n I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air\n\n2:07:21.100 --> 2:07:23.100\n and I wished it wasn't him doing it.\n\n2:07:24.740 --> 2:07:26.640\n And then there was a question of him governing\n\n2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:27.680\n and it was just perfectly clear\n\n2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:29.140\n he didn't know how to govern.\n\n2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:32.820\n What he did have, however, what he does have\n\n2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:35.140\n is an incredible ability to fight.\n\n2:07:35.140 --> 2:07:37.100\n And some of the forces he was arraigned against\n\n2:07:37.100 --> 2:07:38.280\n were arraigned against him.\n\n2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:41.580\n My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else.\n\n2:07:41.580 --> 2:07:46.580\n I mean, they'd have probably done some similar BS\n\n2:07:46.780 --> 2:07:51.140\n against Ted Cruz if he, you know, or Marco Rubio.\n\n2:07:51.140 --> 2:07:54.420\n You know, they'd have said, some people admitted,\n\n2:07:54.420 --> 2:07:56.320\n they'd have accused all these people of racism\n\n2:07:56.320 --> 2:07:57.780\n and misogyny and everything else as well,\n\n2:07:57.780 --> 2:07:58.820\n just like they did Mitt Romney,\n\n2:07:58.820 --> 2:08:01.220\n just like they did John McCain.\n\n2:08:01.220 --> 2:08:03.540\n But Trump was the one ugly enough\n\n2:08:03.540 --> 2:08:05.340\n and bruisey enough to fight.\n\n2:08:06.540 --> 2:08:11.540\n And also a willingness or a lack of willingness\n\n2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:17.540\n to play sort of the civil game of politics.\n\n2:08:18.020 --> 2:08:23.020\n You know, at a party when politeness gets you in trouble.\n\n2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.460\n You show up and everybody's polite\n\n2:08:25.460 --> 2:08:28.220\n and you just out of momentum want to be being polite\n\n2:08:28.220 --> 2:08:30.060\n and all of a sudden you're on an island\n\n2:08:30.060 --> 2:08:33.100\n with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you\n\n2:08:33.100 --> 2:08:34.460\n into a huge amount of trouble.\n\n2:08:34.460 --> 2:08:37.140\n But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities,\n\n2:08:37.140 --> 2:08:41.060\n but I just, you know, look, he screwed up\n\n2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:43.380\n during his time in office because he didn't achieve\n\n2:08:43.380 --> 2:08:44.940\n as much as he should have done.\n\n2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:46.300\n And you could say that about every president,\n\n2:08:46.300 --> 2:08:47.980\n but I refuse to acknowledge that two years\n\n2:08:47.980 --> 2:08:50.100\n when he had both houses in the beginning,\n\n2:08:50.100 --> 2:08:52.300\n he just didn't know what levers to pull.\n\n2:08:52.300 --> 2:08:54.500\n You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office\n\n2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:58.180\n behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news.\n\n2:08:58.180 --> 2:09:00.260\n I'm sorry, that's not a president.\n\n2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:03.900\n And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions\n\n2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:05.660\n because people knew, I mean,\n\n2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:08.020\n people who were very loyal to him,\n\n2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.780\n he would just, you know, he'd get them to do something loyal\n\n2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:12.380\n and then destroy them.\n\n2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:15.740\n And I think, and then we get onto the thing about,\n\n2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:17.380\n and here we get onto the, you know,\n\n2:09:17.380 --> 2:09:19.780\n what of course is very, very fractious terrain,\n\n2:09:19.780 --> 2:09:22.460\n but, you know, I covered the 2020 election\n\n2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:24.420\n and I was traveling all around the states\n\n2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:27.940\n and I went to Trump rally and all sorts of stuff.\n\n2:09:27.940 --> 2:09:31.700\n And I, I mean, I was in DC on election night\n\n2:09:31.700 --> 2:09:35.940\n and it got very ugly at one point\n\n2:09:35.940 --> 2:09:38.660\n in so called Black Lives Matter Plaza.\n\n2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:40.020\n When it looked like Trump might win,\n\n2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:41.980\n when Florida came in and got really,\n\n2:09:41.980 --> 2:09:44.380\n I could feel the air were very, very heated\n\n2:09:44.380 --> 2:09:48.140\n and like some Antifa people started getting into black lock\n\n2:09:48.140 --> 2:09:48.980\n and this sort of stuff.\n\n2:09:48.980 --> 2:09:51.540\n And I thought this town is gonna burn, you know,\n\n2:09:51.540 --> 2:09:52.500\n if Trump wins.\n\n2:09:53.380 --> 2:09:55.500\n And in the aftermath of the vote,\n\n2:09:55.500 --> 2:09:57.260\n I was willing to hang around in Washington for a bit\n\n2:09:57.260 --> 2:09:59.620\n and then I saw what it was gonna drag on.\n\n2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:02.180\n And I saw some of his people and others and people told me\n\n2:10:02.180 --> 2:10:03.700\n they had great evidence of vote rigging\n\n2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:05.220\n and all this sort of thing.\n\n2:10:05.220 --> 2:10:07.380\n And I'm afraid I'm one of those people\n\n2:10:07.380 --> 2:10:11.060\n who doesn't believe that the evidence that they presented\n\n2:10:11.060 --> 2:10:12.580\n is good enough to justify the claim\n\n2:10:12.580 --> 2:10:13.820\n that he won the election.\n\n2:10:14.740 --> 2:10:18.540\n And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules\n\n2:10:18.540 --> 2:10:22.220\n and have you seen, look, the evidence isn't there,\n\n2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:24.820\n that the election was won by Donald Trump.\n\n2:10:24.820 --> 2:10:28.860\n And I think that what he did on January the 6th\n\n2:10:28.860 --> 2:10:32.300\n was unbelievably dangerous.\n\n2:10:32.300 --> 2:10:35.900\n And, you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas\n\n2:10:35.900 --> 2:10:37.340\n in our head at the same time.\n\n2:10:37.340 --> 2:10:39.340\n January the 6th was not nothing,\n\n2:10:40.340 --> 2:10:42.900\n nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup.\n\n2:10:44.380 --> 2:10:49.380\n And there's a vanishing number of people in the US.\n\n2:10:49.380 --> 2:10:51.820\n It was Eric Weinstein who said that the,\n\n2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:56.820\n it's like, this is the roof that you have to walk along.\n\n2:10:56.820 --> 2:11:00.580\n And like the sides are very steep\n\n2:11:00.580 --> 2:11:02.900\n if you fall off either side.\n\n2:11:02.900 --> 2:11:06.740\n Is there some sense, given the forces\n\n2:11:06.740 --> 2:11:08.980\n that are waging war in the West,\n\n2:11:08.980 --> 2:11:13.300\n you said this feeling, perhaps because of Antifa\n\n2:11:13.300 --> 2:11:16.220\n or something else, that this town is gonna burn\n\n2:11:16.220 --> 2:11:18.340\n and maybe a continued feeling that this town\n\n2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:22.420\n is going to burn with the January 6th events.\n\n2:11:22.420 --> 2:11:27.420\n Are you worried about the future of the United States\n\n2:11:27.540 --> 2:11:32.540\n in the coming years because of the feeling of escalation?\n\n2:11:33.220 --> 2:11:36.460\n Is that just a war of Twitter?\n\n2:11:36.460 --> 2:11:40.740\n Or is there a real brewing of something?\n\n2:11:40.740 --> 2:11:41.980\n Oh, it's real.\n\n2:11:41.980 --> 2:11:45.060\n And how, well, let me then respond to that.\n\n2:11:45.060 --> 2:11:47.060\n How, what is the hopeful?\n\n2:11:47.060 --> 2:11:52.060\n If you 10 years from now look back at the United States\n\n2:11:54.540 --> 2:11:58.780\n and say we turned it around, what would be the reason?\n\n2:11:58.780 --> 2:12:01.100\n What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so?\n\n2:12:01.100 --> 2:12:04.380\n Tell you, since I wrote this book,\n\n2:12:04.380 --> 2:12:05.980\n there are two things in particular\n\n2:12:05.980 --> 2:12:10.180\n that I've been really pleased that a specific type\n\n2:12:10.180 --> 2:12:12.280\n of specialist has approached me on\n\n2:12:12.280 --> 2:12:14.420\n to say that things I've written about\n\n2:12:14.420 --> 2:12:17.220\n actually have more application than I realized.\n\n2:12:17.220 --> 2:12:19.820\n One is the gratitude issue.\n\n2:12:19.820 --> 2:12:21.220\n A number of people have approached me\n\n2:12:21.220 --> 2:12:25.980\n who have gone through AA, Alcoholics Anonymous.\n\n2:12:25.980 --> 2:12:27.740\n They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA?\n\n2:12:27.740 --> 2:12:30.020\n And that's a bit of a personal question.\n\n2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:36.580\n But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say,\n\n2:12:36.580 --> 2:12:38.620\n well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation\n\n2:12:38.620 --> 2:12:43.620\n or Alcoholics Anonymous, Norm Macdonald said,\n\n2:12:43.620 --> 2:12:45.020\n it doesn't sound very anonymous.\n\n2:12:45.020 --> 2:12:46.380\n You stand up in a room, you say your name\n\n2:12:46.380 --> 2:12:48.820\n and you tell everyone the worst things you've ever done.\n\n2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:50.260\n Sounds the opposite of anonymous.\n\n2:12:50.260 --> 2:12:52.700\n Anyhow, but they say, look,\n\n2:12:52.700 --> 2:12:54.500\n because if you go to these things,\n\n2:12:54.500 --> 2:12:57.620\n apparently you're asked to, as part of your recovery,\n\n2:12:58.580 --> 2:13:00.420\n say what you're grateful for,\n\n2:13:00.420 --> 2:13:02.020\n like list what you're grateful for.\n\n2:13:02.020 --> 2:13:05.140\n I didn't know that by the way, until the book was out.\n\n2:13:05.140 --> 2:13:07.180\n And so that turned out to have more application\n\n2:13:07.180 --> 2:13:08.180\n than I knew.\n\n2:13:08.180 --> 2:13:09.620\n The other thing though, is that I say\n\n2:13:09.620 --> 2:13:11.980\n that it's absolutely crucial in America\n\n2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.260\n that we try to find things that we agree on.\n\n2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:16.420\n And a couple of times since the book came out,\n\n2:13:16.420 --> 2:13:19.260\n I've been approached by people who are marriage counselors.\n\n2:13:20.220 --> 2:13:21.740\n But we've also said, have you ever been\n\n2:13:21.740 --> 2:13:22.580\n through marriage counseling?\n\n2:13:22.580 --> 2:13:25.020\n And again, that's a very personal question.\n\n2:13:25.020 --> 2:13:27.660\n Stop asking me personal questions.\n\n2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:30.660\n No, but they said, and I said, well, why?\n\n2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:35.220\n Because this is one of the things that we do\n\n2:13:35.220 --> 2:13:39.860\n in couples therapy, is try to find things you agree on.\n\n2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:44.860\n And I think this is very important in America.\n\n2:13:45.460 --> 2:13:47.860\n And it's made much harder by the fact,\n\n2:13:47.860 --> 2:13:48.700\n and I've said this many times,\n\n2:13:48.700 --> 2:13:50.500\n but forgive me if I'm repeating myself,\n\n2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:53.340\n but it's made much harder by the fact\n\n2:13:53.340 --> 2:13:57.460\n that having different opinions is very last century.\n\n2:13:57.460 --> 2:13:59.100\n Now we all have different facts,\n\n2:13:59.100 --> 2:14:02.220\n or at least the two sides have different facts.\n\n2:14:02.220 --> 2:14:05.140\n One half of the country roughly,\n\n2:14:05.140 --> 2:14:07.940\n or let's say 40%, 30%, whatever you want to put it,\n\n2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:10.180\n with a tired minority in the middle.\n\n2:14:11.300 --> 2:14:13.420\n One segment of the country believes\n\n2:14:13.420 --> 2:14:15.980\n that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election\n\n2:14:15.980 --> 2:14:17.100\n and that the Russians interfered\n\n2:14:17.100 --> 2:14:19.500\n and got Donald Trump into power.\n\n2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:20.940\n Another half of the country believes\n\n2:14:20.940 --> 2:14:23.060\n that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\n2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:24.620\n If you can't agree on who wins elections,\n\n2:14:24.620 --> 2:14:27.620\n it's very hard to see what you agree on as a country.\n\n2:14:27.620 --> 2:14:29.380\n That's one of the reasons I mind the war\n\n2:14:29.380 --> 2:14:31.380\n on American history and Western history,\n\n2:14:31.380 --> 2:14:33.620\n is one of the things you have to agree on\n\n2:14:33.620 --> 2:14:36.060\n is at least some attitude towards your past.\n\n2:14:36.060 --> 2:14:37.740\n You don't have to agree on everything.\n\n2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:40.460\n But the public square has to have public heroes\n\n2:14:40.460 --> 2:14:43.260\n who are agreed to be heroes to some extent,\n\n2:14:43.260 --> 2:14:44.180\n warts and all.\n\n2:14:45.380 --> 2:14:47.100\n If you don't have that,\n\n2:14:47.100 --> 2:14:48.780\n if actually you think for instance,\n\n2:14:48.780 --> 2:14:50.580\n half the country thinks the founding fathers\n\n2:14:50.580 --> 2:14:52.060\n were pretty good,\n\n2:14:52.060 --> 2:14:54.500\n the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten,\n\n2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:55.780\n racist and so on.\n\n2:14:55.780 --> 2:14:57.500\n If half the country basically thinks\n\n2:14:57.500 --> 2:14:58.900\n it would have been better if Columbus\n\n2:14:58.900 --> 2:15:01.700\n had taken a different turn, never found America,\n\n2:15:01.700 --> 2:15:05.220\n gone back home and said, I don't know, nothing out there,\n\n2:15:05.220 --> 2:15:06.380\n that would have been better.\n\n2:15:06.380 --> 2:15:08.660\n And the other half's pretty glad in the end\n\n2:15:08.660 --> 2:15:10.380\n that we've got America.\n\n2:15:13.900 --> 2:15:16.540\n You've got to agree on something.\n\n2:15:16.540 --> 2:15:18.500\n And I just see in America,\n\n2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:20.500\n I do think we've got to try to find things to agree on,\n\n2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:23.060\n like a reasonable attitude towards the past.\n\n2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:24.700\n That's why that matters.\n\n2:15:24.700 --> 2:15:27.460\n And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say\n\n2:15:27.460 --> 2:15:29.420\n that everything in the American past was good.\n\n2:15:29.420 --> 2:15:31.980\n God knows that wouldn't stand up to a second of scrutiny\n\n2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:33.260\n or self scrutiny.\n\n2:15:33.260 --> 2:15:35.100\n But nor was it all bad.\n\n2:15:35.100 --> 2:15:38.740\n This wasn't a country formed in sin\n\n2:15:38.740 --> 2:15:40.700\n and in an eradicable sin.\n\n2:15:40.700 --> 2:15:42.900\n It wasn't founded in 1619\n\n2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:45.820\n in order to make the country wicked\n\n2:15:45.820 --> 2:15:49.100\n and incapable of escaping that wickedness.\n\n2:15:49.100 --> 2:15:51.460\n These are things that will matter enormously\n\n2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:52.740\n in the years ahead,\n\n2:15:52.740 --> 2:15:55.780\n because if you can't agree on anything,\n\n2:15:55.780 --> 2:15:57.580\n including who your heroes are,\n\n2:15:59.580 --> 2:16:02.020\n the whole thing is just one massive division\n\n2:16:02.020 --> 2:16:04.100\n and we'll see what I think we're already seeing,\n\n2:16:04.100 --> 2:16:06.300\n which is people basically going to states\n\n2:16:06.300 --> 2:16:09.020\n where it's more like the life they want to live.\n\n2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:11.460\n And some people say to me, well, that's okay.\n\n2:16:11.460 --> 2:16:14.860\n And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that.\n\n2:16:16.340 --> 2:16:18.620\n That's possible, but it's also,\n\n2:16:18.620 --> 2:16:22.700\n it eradicates part of what has been American public life,\n\n2:16:22.700 --> 2:16:24.460\n which is the ability to look at each other\n\n2:16:24.460 --> 2:16:26.860\n and discuss face to face.\n\n2:16:26.860 --> 2:16:30.060\n And I see things like this bomb placed under America\n\n2:16:30.060 --> 2:16:31.980\n the other week with the Supreme Court League,\n\n2:16:31.980 --> 2:16:35.660\n the draft league as being just a further example of that.\n\n2:16:37.220 --> 2:16:39.220\n I'm very, very worried about it in America.\n\n2:16:39.220 --> 2:16:43.220\n And because if America screws up everything,\n\n2:16:43.220 --> 2:16:45.700\n everything else in the world goes.\n\n2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:48.020\n Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still\n\n2:16:48.020 --> 2:16:53.020\n the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded\n\n2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:58.860\n and has been able to live out in better and better forms,\n\n2:16:58.860 --> 2:17:02.580\n sort of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles\n\n2:17:02.580 --> 2:17:03.420\n versus like.\n\n2:17:03.420 --> 2:17:05.380\n And with the desire to improve.\n\n2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:06.220\n Yeah, constantly.\n\n2:17:06.220 --> 2:17:08.300\n An imperfect union.\n\n2:17:08.300 --> 2:17:12.180\n Yeah, well, as I generally have hope that people want\n\n2:17:12.180 --> 2:17:14.780\n to sort of, in terms of gratitude,\n\n2:17:14.780 --> 2:17:19.220\n people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful.\n\n2:17:20.780 --> 2:17:22.460\n It's a better life psychologically.\n\n2:17:22.460 --> 2:17:25.860\n The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within.\n\n2:17:25.860 --> 2:17:30.540\n So I just feel that people will long for that\n\n2:17:30.540 --> 2:17:31.380\n and will find that.\n\n2:17:31.380 --> 2:17:33.580\n And that's the American way.\n\n2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:36.660\n Some of the division that we reveal now has to do\n\n2:17:36.660 --> 2:17:38.860\n with new technologies like social media.\n\n2:17:38.860 --> 2:17:43.220\n That kind of is a small kind of deviation\n\n2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:45.340\n from the path we're on because it's a new,\n\n2:17:45.340 --> 2:17:47.860\n we've got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons.\n\n2:17:47.860 --> 2:17:49.740\n Yeah, which are relatively new.\n\n2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:53.700\n But we need to find reasonable attitudes\n\n2:17:53.700 --> 2:17:54.540\n towards these things.\n\n2:17:54.540 --> 2:17:58.180\n And that's why I say it matters how you and my feedback\n\n2:17:58.180 --> 2:18:01.340\n on social media, because we're all going through it\n\n2:18:01.340 --> 2:18:02.180\n to some extent.\n\n2:18:02.180 --> 2:18:03.020\n Yeah, we're learning.\n\n2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:03.860\n And we're learning.\n\n2:18:03.860 --> 2:18:08.500\n And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad.\n\n2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:12.380\n I say this, it was my minimalist call to friends\n\n2:18:12.380 --> 2:18:16.820\n in this era was the main job is not to go insane.\n\n2:18:16.820 --> 2:18:17.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:18:17.660 --> 2:18:20.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:22.780\n And yeah, like walk towards sanity.\n\n2:18:22.780 --> 2:18:26.900\n Because I'm sure there's a Hunter S. Thompson quote\n\n2:18:26.900 --> 2:18:29.140\n in there, like insanity on the weekends\n\n2:18:29.140 --> 2:18:30.460\n can be at least fun.\n\n2:18:30.460 --> 2:18:33.140\n Okay, do you have advice for young people\n\n2:18:35.580 --> 2:18:38.700\n that just put down their TikTok and are listening\n\n2:18:38.700 --> 2:18:41.540\n to this podcast in high school and college\n\n2:18:41.540 --> 2:18:43.940\n about how to have a career, how to have a life\n\n2:18:43.940 --> 2:18:44.980\n they can be proud of?\n\n2:18:47.220 --> 2:18:48.180\n It's a very broad question.\n\n2:18:48.180 --> 2:18:52.100\n But of course, I mean, I can give specific advice\n\n2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:53.380\n to people who want to be writers and so on,\n\n2:18:53.380 --> 2:18:54.820\n but that's a bit niche, maybe.\n\n2:18:56.060 --> 2:18:57.740\n Well, writers will be very interesting,\n\n2:18:57.740 --> 2:18:58.740\n sorry to interrupt.\n\n2:18:58.740 --> 2:19:00.820\n Also how to put your ideas down on paper\n\n2:19:00.820 --> 2:19:03.100\n and think through the ideas, develop them\n\n2:19:03.100 --> 2:19:07.100\n and have the guts to go to a large audience,\n\n2:19:07.100 --> 2:19:09.620\n especially when the ideas are sort of controversial\n\n2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:10.940\n or dangerous or difficult.\n\n2:19:10.940 --> 2:19:13.340\n Well, the main thing to do is to read.\n\n2:19:13.340 --> 2:19:16.460\n When I was a schoolboy, I'd ever have a book in my pocket,\n\n2:19:17.820 --> 2:19:20.380\n the side pocket of my jacket, only side pocket,\n\n2:19:20.380 --> 2:19:21.540\n and would read.\n\n2:19:21.540 --> 2:19:26.540\n And that wasn't just because I was swatish in some way,\n\n2:19:26.900 --> 2:19:30.740\n but because I discovered probably at some point\n\n2:19:30.740 --> 2:19:32.740\n in my early teens, I discovered something.\n\n2:19:32.740 --> 2:19:34.660\n I wrote about this once.\n\n2:19:34.660 --> 2:19:37.860\n I discovered that books were dangerous,\n\n2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:41.580\n which was a thrilling discovery.\n\n2:19:44.500 --> 2:19:46.740\n I discovered that they could contain anything.\n\n2:19:47.860 --> 2:19:50.380\n And also people didn't know what you were reading.\n\n2:19:50.380 --> 2:19:52.660\n I remember I get far too young an age,\n\n2:19:52.660 --> 2:19:55.260\n I read The Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley,\n\n2:19:56.820 --> 2:20:01.820\n and I didn't make head or tail of it probably,\n\n2:20:01.900 --> 2:20:04.380\n but I knew that it was about something really interesting\n\n2:20:04.380 --> 2:20:05.420\n and dangerous.\n\n2:20:06.660 --> 2:20:10.660\n And I thought constantly when I read poetry\n\n2:20:10.660 --> 2:20:15.100\n or read history, I think I was just constantly thrilled\n\n2:20:16.300 --> 2:20:18.820\n and wanted to know more.\n\n2:20:18.820 --> 2:20:23.820\n And if you wanna become a writer, you have to be a reader.\n\n2:20:26.340 --> 2:20:27.980\n You have to read the best stuff.\n\n2:20:29.660 --> 2:20:33.540\n And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is,\n\n2:20:33.540 --> 2:20:37.460\n and you'll find the people that really impress you.\n\n2:20:37.460 --> 2:20:39.620\n But I know that I just came across certain writers\n\n2:20:39.620 --> 2:20:42.220\n who just knocked me off my feet.\n\n2:20:42.220 --> 2:20:47.220\n And when you find those people, read everything\n\n2:20:50.380 --> 2:20:53.580\n and cling on to them and find other people like that,\n\n2:20:53.580 --> 2:20:56.980\n find other writers like that, people that are connected\n\n2:20:56.980 --> 2:21:01.620\n by history or scholarship or circles or whatever.\n\n2:21:01.620 --> 2:21:03.940\n For you, was it fiction or nonfiction?\n\n2:21:03.940 --> 2:21:06.380\n Is there a particular books that you just remember\n\n2:21:06.380 --> 2:21:07.940\n or just give you pause?\n\n2:21:07.940 --> 2:21:09.340\n Well, I remember that the first book\n\n2:21:09.340 --> 2:21:13.180\n that absolutely threw me was the Lord of the Flies\n\n2:21:13.180 --> 2:21:15.380\n of William Golding, which used to be a signed text\n\n2:21:15.380 --> 2:21:18.460\n and everyone's a bit snotty about because it's so popular.\n\n2:21:19.820 --> 2:21:22.780\n But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book\n\n2:21:22.780 --> 2:21:26.380\n I read in that I had been used to the world\n\n2:21:26.380 --> 2:21:29.780\n of children's literature of everything ends up fine\n\n2:21:29.780 --> 2:21:32.580\n in the end, the lost all get found.\n\n2:21:34.180 --> 2:21:37.780\n And this was the first book I read where that's not the case\n\n2:21:37.780 --> 2:21:39.580\n the world turns out differently.\n\n2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:42.500\n And I remember for days afterwards,\n\n2:21:42.500 --> 2:21:44.700\n I was just in a state of shock.\n\n2:21:46.020 --> 2:21:51.020\n I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered\n\n2:21:51.380 --> 2:21:54.100\n and partly because I sort of intuited it must be true.\n\n2:21:55.380 --> 2:21:57.340\n And of course, that is not to say that the Lord of the Flies\n\n2:21:57.340 --> 2:22:01.020\n lots of scholarship on what children do in this situation\n\n2:22:01.020 --> 2:22:04.540\n of being on the island when they do congregate and anyhow.\n\n2:22:04.540 --> 2:22:07.020\n But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world\n\n2:22:07.020 --> 2:22:11.580\n and it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it.\n\n2:22:14.540 --> 2:22:15.580\n It was dangerous.\n\n2:22:15.580 --> 2:22:16.420\n And it was dangerous.\n\n2:22:16.420 --> 2:22:19.540\n And then of course, when I became interested in sex,\n\n2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:21.340\n let alone when I realized I was gay,\n\n2:22:21.340 --> 2:22:23.700\n I realized books were a very, very good way to learn\n\n2:22:23.700 --> 2:22:25.660\n about what I was.\n\n2:22:25.660 --> 2:22:28.540\n And that was even more dangerous in a way.\n\n2:22:28.540 --> 2:22:31.900\n And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know.\n\n2:22:33.340 --> 2:22:36.420\n You discovered sex, that was an invention in books?\n\n2:22:36.420 --> 2:22:37.260\n What do you mean?\n\n2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:39.420\n No, what I mean is, nobody, no, no, no, no.\n\n2:22:39.420 --> 2:22:41.660\n What I mean is that one of the things that gay people have\n\n2:22:41.660 --> 2:22:43.540\n when they're growing up is that\n\n2:22:43.540 --> 2:22:45.380\n you have this terribly big secret\n\n2:22:45.380 --> 2:22:47.100\n and you don't think the world will ever know,\n\n2:22:47.100 --> 2:22:49.460\n you hope the world will never know.\n\n2:22:49.460 --> 2:22:54.020\n And it's been called by one psychologist,\n\n2:22:54.020 --> 2:22:56.180\n the little boy with a big secret.\n\n2:22:56.180 --> 2:22:59.900\n And so if you discover that other people\n\n2:22:59.900 --> 2:23:01.900\n have the same secret, there's a sort of,\n\n2:23:03.220 --> 2:23:04.460\n thank God for that.\n\n2:23:04.460 --> 2:23:07.420\n But I mean, that's just a version\n\n2:23:07.420 --> 2:23:09.380\n of what everybody gets in reading in a way,\n\n2:23:09.380 --> 2:23:11.020\n which is the thrill of discovery\n\n2:23:11.020 --> 2:23:14.180\n that somebody else thought something you thought\n\n2:23:14.180 --> 2:23:15.340\n only you'd thought.\n\n2:23:15.340 --> 2:23:18.820\n I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature\n\n2:23:18.820 --> 2:23:21.420\n is when a voice comes from across the centuries\n\n2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:24.700\n and seems to leave a handprint, you know.\n\n2:23:24.700 --> 2:23:26.740\n And makes you feel a little bit less alone\n\n2:23:26.740 --> 2:23:28.500\n because somebody else feels,\n\n2:23:28.500 --> 2:23:31.020\n sees the world the same way, is the same way.\n\n2:23:31.020 --> 2:23:34.380\n That's what C.S. Lewis is said to have said,\n\n2:23:34.380 --> 2:23:36.340\n we read to know we're not alone.\n\n2:23:37.740 --> 2:23:39.300\n But we don't only read to know we're not alone,\n\n2:23:39.300 --> 2:23:41.380\n we read to become other people.\n\n2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:44.300\n I mean, I think I saw in books\n\n2:23:44.300 --> 2:23:45.980\n a version of the life I wanted to live\n\n2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:48.180\n and then I decided to live it.\n\n2:23:48.180 --> 2:23:50.220\n And I'm fortunate enough to have done so.\n\n2:23:52.780 --> 2:23:54.580\n I wanted to live in the world of ideas\n\n2:23:54.580 --> 2:23:56.820\n and books and debate.\n\n2:23:58.340 --> 2:24:01.620\n I wanted to live in the debates of my time, you know.\n\n2:24:01.620 --> 2:24:04.460\n And I remember when, like a lot of people,\n\n2:24:04.460 --> 2:24:06.420\n I read Auden when I was young.\n\n2:24:06.420 --> 2:24:09.740\n And, you know, certain lines obviously stuck with me.\n\n2:24:09.740 --> 2:24:12.980\n But that poem of his which everybody, you know,\n\n2:24:12.980 --> 2:24:17.780\n knows and which he hated, September the 1st, 1939,\n\n2:24:17.780 --> 2:24:21.220\n I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me.\n\n2:24:22.340 --> 2:24:24.060\n What's that one, you know, sitting on a dive\n\n2:24:24.060 --> 2:24:26.540\n and for a second or three, degraded and alone,\n\n2:24:28.660 --> 2:24:31.340\n at the end of a low, dishonest decade.\n\n2:24:31.340 --> 2:24:32.700\n Of course, there's a problem with that line,\n\n2:24:32.700 --> 2:24:34.220\n which is you kind of want to be living\n\n2:24:34.220 --> 2:24:36.540\n at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well.\n\n2:24:36.540 --> 2:24:38.620\n It sounds sort of cool in a way.\n\n2:24:38.620 --> 2:24:41.260\n You know, you're the only person who sees it.\n\n2:24:41.260 --> 2:24:43.500\n But, so yeah, anyhow, that's the diversion.\n\n2:24:43.500 --> 2:24:45.340\n But the point is, if you want to be a writer,\n\n2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:46.620\n you've got to be a reader.\n\n2:24:47.540 --> 2:24:48.460\n And apart from anything else,\n\n2:24:48.460 --> 2:24:50.900\n you discover the lilt of language\n\n2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:53.380\n and the things you can do.\n\n2:24:53.380 --> 2:24:56.220\n And I've read people who, and I still do,\n\n2:24:56.220 --> 2:25:00.100\n I think, my God, I didn't know, how did you do that?\n\n2:25:00.100 --> 2:25:03.060\n In fact, books for me now, and articles and other things,\n\n2:25:03.060 --> 2:25:04.180\n fall into two categories.\n\n2:25:04.180 --> 2:25:05.780\n One is, I know how you did that.\n\n2:25:07.060 --> 2:25:10.260\n And the other is, I don't know how you did that.\n\n2:25:10.260 --> 2:25:13.260\n And the best feeling as a writer\n\n2:25:13.260 --> 2:25:15.520\n is when you do the second one.\n\n2:25:16.700 --> 2:25:19.460\n And it happens occasionally in my writing life.\n\n2:25:19.460 --> 2:25:21.540\n Will you almost like return to something you've written\n\n2:25:21.540 --> 2:25:22.540\n or like right after you write it?\n\n2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:23.940\n No, the moment you write it.\n\n2:25:23.940 --> 2:25:25.580\n You wonder, how did I do that?\n\n2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:26.660\n Yes.\n\n2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:29.380\n That's the most, I've never said that before.\n\n2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:31.580\n That's the happiest thing in writing.\n\n2:25:32.500 --> 2:25:33.860\n Very occasionally, it sounds,\n\n2:25:33.860 --> 2:25:37.540\n but I've occasionally finished something.\n\n2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:38.900\n Funny enough, it happened some years ago\n\n2:25:38.900 --> 2:25:41.460\n in a long piece I wrote about the artist, Basquiat.\n\n2:25:44.540 --> 2:25:46.980\n I finished the piece and I gasped.\n\n2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:50.940\n I didn't know, because that's also a thing with writing,\n\n2:25:50.940 --> 2:25:55.380\n is you, it's not, sometimes people say you need to write\n\n2:25:55.380 --> 2:25:56.300\n in order to know what you think.\n\n2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:58.180\n That's not quite true.\n\n2:25:58.180 --> 2:26:00.500\n Sometimes that's a very bad piece of advice\n\n2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:03.420\n for some writers who don't know what they think\n\n2:26:03.420 --> 2:26:04.740\n and it's not gonna become clearer\n\n2:26:04.740 --> 2:26:06.040\n if they just start typing.\n\n2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:12.780\n But sometimes it is true that you,\n\n2:26:12.780 --> 2:26:15.660\n there's a thought that's just waiting there\n\n2:26:15.660 --> 2:26:17.660\n and a clarity that comes across\n\n2:26:17.660 --> 2:26:20.660\n and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain.\n\n2:26:20.660 --> 2:26:24.480\n And by the time you typed it, you just go, yes.\n\n2:26:25.540 --> 2:26:27.220\n That's the greatest feeling as a writer.\n\n2:26:27.220 --> 2:26:29.780\n Almost like it came from somewhere else.\n\n2:26:29.780 --> 2:26:34.780\n That's what Bakunin says about what's the moment.\n\n2:26:34.900 --> 2:26:36.540\n It's Tom Stoppard's favorite quote\n\n2:26:36.540 --> 2:26:38.780\n about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment\n\n2:26:38.780 --> 2:26:42.100\n where the writer's pen, when he pauses,\n\n2:26:42.100 --> 2:26:43.700\n where does he go in that moment?\n\n2:26:45.220 --> 2:26:46.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:46.620 --> 2:26:47.780\n That's so interesting.\n\n2:26:49.860 --> 2:26:52.400\n Because I think the answer to that question\n\n2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:54.460\n will help us explain consciousness\n\n2:26:54.460 --> 2:26:58.180\n and all those other weird things about the human mind.\n\n2:26:58.180 --> 2:26:59.660\n So that was advice for writers.\n\n2:26:59.660 --> 2:27:02.880\n I didn't really give any advice for people in general.\n\n2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:05.240\n Is that, oh, you wanna give health advice?\n\n2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:06.080\n No.\n\n2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:07.540\n To your channel, Churchill?\n\n2:27:07.540 --> 2:27:09.140\n No, I don't wanna give health advice.\n\n2:27:09.140 --> 2:27:10.260\n Clearly.\n\n2:27:10.260 --> 2:27:12.100\n Because you implied that Churchill\n\n2:27:12.100 --> 2:27:15.240\n was one of your early guides in that aspect.\n\n2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:17.780\n So when you discovered your sexuality,\n\n2:27:17.780 --> 2:27:19.280\n let me ask about love.\n\n2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:24.280\n Far too personal of a question to ask a Brit.\n\n2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:28.160\n But what was that like?\n\n2:27:28.160 --> 2:27:31.720\n And broadly speaking, what's the role of love\n\n2:27:31.720 --> 2:27:33.080\n in the human condition?\n\n2:27:35.100 --> 2:27:37.040\n Sex and love.\n\n2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:40.880\n And for you personally, discovering that you were\n\n2:27:40.880 --> 2:27:43.780\n and maybe telling the world that you were gay.\n\n2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:48.040\n I'm very perilously personal.\n\n2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:49.400\n I do actually have a sort of rule\n\n2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:51.400\n that I don't talk about in my personal life.\n\n2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:52.720\n Rules are meant to be broken.\n\n2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:54.560\n Okay, well I'll break it a little bit.\n\n2:27:57.200 --> 2:27:58.800\n One of the ways in which growing up\n\n2:27:58.800 --> 2:28:00.400\n and realizing you're gay differs from growing up\n\n2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:05.240\n and being straight is that it's almost inevitable\n\n2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:08.100\n that your first passions will be unrequited.\n\n2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:13.520\n Oh wow, I never thought about that, yeah.\n\n2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:17.320\n Now that's not to say, there's plenty of unrequited love\n\n2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:19.160\n among young men for young women,\n\n2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:21.760\n young women for young men, plenty of that.\n\n2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:23.520\n But it's almost inevitable if you're gay\n\n2:28:23.520 --> 2:28:28.520\n that your first passions will be totally unrequited.\n\n2:28:30.040 --> 2:28:33.120\n Because the odds are that the person in question\n\n2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:33.960\n will not be gay.\n\n2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:37.520\n So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak.\n\n2:28:37.520 --> 2:28:40.480\n It's heartbreak and disappointment.\n\n2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:43.240\n Heartbreak can be beautiful too, it's formative.\n\n2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:45.360\n Well again, it comes back to the thing\n\n2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:46.600\n if you're a writer or something,\n\n2:28:46.600 --> 2:28:48.880\n that you can always do something with it.\n\n2:28:48.880 --> 2:28:51.480\n That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted.\n\n2:28:53.880 --> 2:28:56.120\n I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here.\n\n2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:01.120\n No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers\n\n2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:05.160\n because you always think, well I could use that.\n\n2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:08.200\n It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware.\n\n2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:10.240\n It's almost like a drug, right?\n\n2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:11.680\n No, it's not like a drug.\n\n2:29:11.680 --> 2:29:15.120\n It's the fear that all things,\n\n2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:18.320\n even the greatest suffering could be material.\n\n2:29:19.680 --> 2:29:22.360\n What's the danger in that exactly?\n\n2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:25.200\n That seeing the material in the human experience,\n\n2:29:25.200 --> 2:29:26.960\n you don't experience it fully?\n\n2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:29.800\n You don't experience it fully and you might be using it.\n\n2:29:30.760 --> 2:29:33.320\n I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend\n\n2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:36.480\n who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s.\n\n2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:38.120\n And he said he knew at the moment\n\n2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:39.240\n he was told about his friend's death.\n\n2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:42.200\n A tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem.\n\n2:29:42.200 --> 2:29:43.500\n And he did and the poem was wonderful.\n\n2:29:43.500 --> 2:29:45.680\n But there's always that slight guilt for writers\n\n2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:48.280\n of am I going to use that?\n\n2:29:48.280 --> 2:29:50.000\n Anyhow, that's a diversion.\n\n2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:51.560\n Life is full of guilty pleasures\n\n2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:52.640\n and I think that's one of them.\n\n2:29:52.640 --> 2:29:54.640\n Because if you feel that guilt,\n\n2:29:54.640 --> 2:29:58.000\n really what you're doing is you're capturing that moment\n\n2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:01.400\n and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people\n\n2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:02.760\n by writing about that moment\n\n2:30:02.760 --> 2:30:04.740\n because it's going to stimulate something\n\n2:30:04.740 --> 2:30:06.440\n that resonates with those people\n\n2:30:06.440 --> 2:30:08.100\n because they had similar kinds of memories\n\n2:30:08.100 --> 2:30:10.760\n about a loss and a passion towards somebody\n\n2:30:10.760 --> 2:30:11.840\n that they had to lose.\n\n2:30:11.840 --> 2:30:15.520\n So yes, but there's a good sign, perhaps.\n\n2:30:15.520 --> 2:30:19.760\n More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones\n\n2:30:19.760 --> 2:30:23.840\n or bad places and wanting to find bad stories\n\n2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:24.920\n because it's useful.\n\n2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:27.060\n And there is a definite guilt you get\n\n2:30:27.060 --> 2:30:28.200\n from that sort of thing.\n\n2:30:28.200 --> 2:30:30.960\n Like the worse the situation, the more useful.\n\n2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:35.040\n Anyhow, no, so that's sort of the only difference\n\n2:30:35.040 --> 2:30:36.480\n that happens from growing up being gay.\n\n2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:39.780\n And it means that most, certainly in my generation,\n\n2:30:39.780 --> 2:30:44.780\n most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later.\n\n2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:49.160\n And there's lots of explanations of that\n\n2:30:49.160 --> 2:30:52.640\n maybe being one of the reasons for perceived\n\n2:30:52.640 --> 2:30:55.220\n or otherwise promiscuity among gay men,\n\n2:30:55.220 --> 2:30:57.040\n which is, I think, more easily persuaded\n\n2:30:57.040 --> 2:31:00.280\n by the fact that gay men behave like men would\n\n2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:01.440\n if women were men.\n\n2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:06.040\n That's one explanation,\n\n2:31:06.040 --> 2:31:08.560\n but it's both a feature and a bug\n\n2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:12.760\n that you come to sexual flourishing later in life.\n\n2:31:12.760 --> 2:31:16.760\n That could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life,\n\n2:31:16.760 --> 2:31:18.980\n that could be a positive or a negative.\n\n2:31:18.980 --> 2:31:21.940\n But what's, broadly speaking, is the role of love\n\n2:31:21.940 --> 2:31:24.300\n in the human condition, Douglas?\n\n2:31:25.800 --> 2:31:28.800\n Well, it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point.\n\n2:31:30.040 --> 2:31:31.120\n What is the point?\n\n2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:32.360\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:31:32.360 --> 2:31:33.400\n Let's go there.\n\n2:31:33.400 --> 2:31:36.040\n So what's the meaning is a hard one, of course.\n\n2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:38.620\n Where is the meaning is slightly easier.\n\n2:31:40.620 --> 2:31:43.720\n And I'd say that everyone can find that.\n\n2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:46.160\n You gravitate towards the places you find meaning.\n\n2:31:47.040 --> 2:31:48.520\n Now, there's a conservative answer to this,\n\n2:31:48.520 --> 2:31:49.520\n which is quite useful,\n\n2:31:49.520 --> 2:31:51.580\n and it's certainly more useful than any others,\n\n2:31:51.580 --> 2:31:53.520\n because the conservative answer is find meaning\n\n2:31:53.520 --> 2:31:55.160\n where people have found it before,\n\n2:31:56.280 --> 2:31:58.160\n which is a very, very good answer.\n\n2:31:59.160 --> 2:32:02.720\n If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship\n\n2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:07.720\n or a particular canon of work, go there,\n\n2:32:08.640 --> 2:32:11.680\n because it's been proven by time\n\n2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:13.920\n to be able to give you the goods.\n\n2:32:16.200 --> 2:32:18.000\n Much more sensible than saying,\n\n2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.400\n hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning.\n\n2:32:24.520 --> 2:32:26.340\n But love is,\n\n2:32:26.340 --> 2:32:31.340\n love is probably the nearest thing we can have\n\n2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:36.860\n to the divine on Earth.\n\n2:32:36.860 --> 2:32:40.300\n And of course, the problem of what exactly,\n\n2:32:40.300 --> 2:32:43.740\n what type of love we mean is an issue.\n\n2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:44.740\n Well, that goes to the fact\n\n2:32:44.740 --> 2:32:47.900\n that you don't like definitions anyway.\n\n2:32:47.900 --> 2:32:48.780\n I do like definitions.\n\n2:32:48.780 --> 2:32:51.220\n I just think they need to be pinned down.\n\n2:32:51.220 --> 2:32:55.020\n But let's not go there at the moment,\n\n2:32:55.020 --> 2:32:57.620\n because it's, yeah.\n\n2:32:57.620 --> 2:32:59.340\n That's not pinned down love at the moment.\n\n2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:01.620\n Well, no, because as you know,\n\n2:33:01.620 --> 2:33:03.380\n I mean, because of the different varieties of love\n\n2:33:03.380 --> 2:33:05.180\n and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture\n\n2:33:05.180 --> 2:33:06.780\n and that it means an awful lot of things\n\n2:33:06.780 --> 2:33:09.240\n and we don't delineate it well.\n\n2:33:09.240 --> 2:33:12.940\n But let's say human love\n\n2:33:12.940 --> 2:33:17.940\n with the greatest fulfillment in sexual,\n\n2:33:18.020 --> 2:33:21.340\n fulfillment in sexual love with another person\n\n2:33:21.340 --> 2:33:26.340\n is probably the greatest intimation you can have\n\n2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:31.340\n of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love.\n\n2:33:35.020 --> 2:33:40.020\n And it's the sense that all young lovers have,\n\n2:33:40.420 --> 2:33:44.180\n which is that they've just walked through the low door\n\n2:33:44.180 --> 2:33:47.280\n in the garden and found themselves in bliss.\n\n2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:48.620\n And that this is,\n\n2:33:48.620 --> 2:33:53.620\n there's a beautiful, beautiful poem of,\n\n2:33:55.020 --> 2:33:56.140\n can I read it to you?\n\n2:33:56.140 --> 2:33:57.820\n Yes, please.\n\n2:33:57.820 --> 2:33:58.660\n I'll try to find it.\n\n2:33:58.660 --> 2:34:01.980\n There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkins,\n\n2:34:01.980 --> 2:34:05.020\n which slightly says what I'm,\n\n2:34:06.700 --> 2:34:08.540\n I'm trying not to duck your question\n\n2:34:08.540 --> 2:34:10.900\n by referring to other people, but.\n\n2:34:10.900 --> 2:34:13.240\n Maybe that's the best way to answer the question.\n\n2:34:13.240 --> 2:34:14.080\n Could be.\n\n2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:16.740\n Is to read a poem.\n\n2:34:16.740 --> 2:34:21.740\n So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows,\n\n2:34:21.860 --> 2:34:26.860\n which is remarkable because he came to sexual,\n\n2:34:30.620 --> 2:34:33.820\n he was straight, he had a rather unhappy sex life,\n\n2:34:33.820 --> 2:34:38.820\n but he came to sexual affection in the 40s and 50s\n\n2:34:38.820 --> 2:34:41.300\n and all the hell that that involved.\n\n2:34:41.300 --> 2:34:46.300\n And he took what I,\n\n2:34:46.300 --> 2:34:49.140\n I regard as being a really remarkable and important view\n\n2:34:49.140 --> 2:34:51.260\n on the sexual revolution in the 60s,\n\n2:34:51.260 --> 2:34:52.700\n which is that most people of his generation,\n\n2:34:52.700 --> 2:34:54.620\n most older people resented the young.\n\n2:34:57.280 --> 2:34:58.820\n They resented the freedom they had,\n\n2:34:58.820 --> 2:35:00.660\n and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible\n\n2:35:00.660 --> 2:35:02.220\n and it was always getting likely to.\n\n2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:03.740\n And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly,\n\n2:35:03.740 --> 2:35:06.180\n he was a very conservative person, took a different view.\n\n2:35:06.180 --> 2:35:07.620\n And he says it in his poem,\n\n2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:09.980\n and the opening of the poem is he says,\n\n2:35:09.980 --> 2:35:13.700\n when I see a couple of kids and guess he's fucking her\n\n2:35:13.700 --> 2:35:16.980\n and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,\n\n2:35:16.980 --> 2:35:19.160\n I know this is paradise.\n\n2:35:19.160 --> 2:35:22.540\n Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives,\n\n2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:25.180\n bonds and gestures pushed to one side\n\n2:35:25.180 --> 2:35:28.020\n like an outdated combine harvester,\n\n2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:31.780\n and everyone young going down the long slide\n\n2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:34.500\n to happiness endlessly.\n\n2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:38.940\n I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought,\n\n2:35:38.940 --> 2:35:41.260\n that'll be the life, no God anymore,\n\n2:35:41.260 --> 2:35:44.180\n or sweating in the dark about hell and that,\n\n2:35:44.180 --> 2:35:46.860\n or having to hide what you think of the priest.\n\n2:35:46.860 --> 2:35:49.980\n He and his lot will all go down the long slide\n\n2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:52.820\n like free bloody birds.\n\n2:35:52.820 --> 2:35:55.860\n And immediately, rather than words,\n\n2:35:55.860 --> 2:35:58.820\n comes the thought of high windows,\n\n2:35:58.820 --> 2:36:01.220\n the some comprehending glass,\n\n2:36:01.220 --> 2:36:03.820\n and beyond it the deep blue air\n\n2:36:03.820 --> 2:36:08.820\n that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless.\n\n2:36:08.820 --> 2:36:12.780\n The divine, he found it.\n\n2:36:12.780 --> 2:36:16.860\n He found it in seeing a couple of young kids\n\n2:36:16.860 --> 2:36:20.180\n and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm.\n\n2:36:20.180 --> 2:36:21.620\n Do you see what I mean?\n\n2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:22.860\n First of all, it's very counterintuitive,\n\n2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:25.220\n but secondly, this is the point that sex\n\n2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:28.320\n had been so tied up with misery.\n\n2:36:29.380 --> 2:36:30.820\n I mean, people don't remember this now\n\n2:36:30.820 --> 2:36:32.980\n when they talk about the past.\n\n2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:34.460\n I mean, there's one of my favorite books,\n\n2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:36.620\n Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday,\n\n2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:39.100\n you know, descriptions of what it was like\n\n2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:42.100\n trying to have sex in pre First World War Vienna.\n\n2:36:42.100 --> 2:36:43.540\n You know, all the men ended up\n\n2:36:43.540 --> 2:36:45.780\n going to female prostitutes.\n\n2:36:45.780 --> 2:36:48.020\n You know, so many of them got syphilis,\n\n2:36:48.020 --> 2:36:49.700\n and this was their first experience of sex.\n\n2:36:49.700 --> 2:36:51.380\n It was so goddamn awful,\n\n2:36:51.380 --> 2:36:53.340\n and they were stuck with it all their lives.\n\n2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:56.860\n And so there's lots of stuff that's gone better\n\n2:36:56.860 --> 2:36:59.460\n in our last century, and that's one of them.\n\n2:36:59.460 --> 2:37:00.320\n But you ask about love.\n\n2:37:00.320 --> 2:37:02.540\n Yes, I do think that love is basically\n\n2:37:02.540 --> 2:37:07.540\n the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine.\n\n2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:12.200\n And by the way, sex, liberating sex,\n\n2:37:12.200 --> 2:37:15.520\n doesn't buy you love either.\n\n2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:18.060\n No, I mean, it throws in an entirely,\n\n2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:21.760\n it threw in another set of problems.\n\n2:37:24.140 --> 2:37:27.160\n If there's any meaning on top of all of that\n\n2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:31.220\n is we like to find problems and solve that\n\n2:37:31.220 --> 2:37:35.460\n as a human species, and sometimes we even create problems.\n\n2:37:37.980 --> 2:37:39.700\n Douglas, thank you for highlighting\n\n2:37:39.700 --> 2:37:41.900\n all the problems of human civilization\n\n2:37:41.900 --> 2:37:44.260\n and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future.\n\n2:37:44.260 --> 2:37:46.580\n
