structures in orbit\n\n00:07.520 --> 00:10.760\n is gonna give us this promise of space architecture\n\n00:10.760 --> 00:12.320\n that's actually worth living in.\n\n00:12.320 --> 00:14.500\n You see, you do believe we might one day\n\n00:14.500 --> 00:17.920\n become intergalactic civilization.\n\n00:17.920 --> 00:19.060\n I have a hope, yeah.\n\n00:21.280 --> 00:24.240\n The following is a conversation with Ariel Ekblah,\n\n00:24.240 --> 00:27.400\n Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.\n\n00:27.400 --> 00:30.120\n She's especially interested in autonomously\n\n00:30.120 --> 00:32.700\n self assembling space architectures.\n\n00:32.700 --> 00:35.880\n Basically, giant space structures\n\n00:35.880 --> 00:37.720\n that can sustain human life\n\n00:37.720 --> 00:40.440\n and that assemble themselves out in space\n\n00:40.440 --> 00:45.440\n and then orbit Earth, Moon, Mars, and other planets.\n\n00:46.240 --> 00:48.280\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:48.280 --> 00:50.240\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:50.240 --> 00:51.480\n in the description.\n\n00:51.480 --> 00:55.420\n And now, dear friends, here's Ariel Ekblah.\n\n00:55.420 --> 00:59.540\n When did you first fall in love with space exploration\n\n00:59.540 --> 01:01.260\n and space in general?\n\n01:01.260 --> 01:04.100\n My parents are both ex Air Force.\n\n01:04.100 --> 01:05.860\n So my dad's an A10 fighter pilot\n\n01:05.860 --> 01:09.660\n and my mom trained and had qualified to be a fighter pilot,\n\n01:09.660 --> 01:11.000\n but it was early enough\n\n01:11.000 --> 01:13.380\n that women were not allowed in combat at that time.\n\n01:13.380 --> 01:16.380\n And so I grew up with these two pilots\n\n01:16.380 --> 01:18.620\n and although they themselves did not become astronauts,\n\n01:18.620 --> 01:20.960\n there's a really rich legacy of Air Force pilots\n\n01:20.960 --> 01:24.260\n becoming astronauts and this loomed large in my childhood.\n\n01:24.260 --> 01:26.780\n What does it mean to be courageous, to be an explorer,\n\n01:26.780 --> 01:31.680\n to be at the vanguard of something hard and challenging?\n\n01:31.680 --> 01:32.900\n And to couple with that,\n\n01:32.900 --> 01:35.060\n my dad was a huge fan of science fiction.\n\n01:35.060 --> 01:39.580\n And so I, as a kid, read Heinlein and Isaac Asimov,\n\n01:39.580 --> 01:41.220\n all these different classics of science fiction\n\n01:41.220 --> 01:42.500\n that he had introduced me to.\n\n01:42.500 --> 01:45.900\n And that just started a love affair with space exploration\n\n01:45.900 --> 01:47.820\n and really thinking about\n\n01:47.820 --> 01:50.740\n civilization scale space exploration.\n\n01:50.740 --> 01:55.740\n So did they themselves dream about going to the stars\n\n01:57.720 --> 02:01.020\n as opposed to flying here in Earth's atmosphere,\n\n02:01.020 --> 02:02.000\n just looking up?\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.100\n Yeah, my dad always said he was absolutely convinced\n\n02:04.100 --> 02:06.300\n because he was a child of the Apollo years\n\n02:06.300 --> 02:08.580\n that he would get to go in his lifetime,\n\n02:08.580 --> 02:09.980\n really thought it was gonna happen.\n\n02:09.980 --> 02:12.760\n And so it was a challenge and sad for many people\n\n02:12.760 --> 02:15.220\n when to their view on the outside,\n\n02:15.220 --> 02:17.940\n space exploration slowed down for a period of time.\n\n02:17.940 --> 02:19.700\n In reality, we were just catching up.\n\n02:19.700 --> 02:23.140\n I think we leapt so far ahead with Apollo,\n\n02:23.140 --> 02:25.260\n more than the rest of society was ready for.\n\n02:25.260 --> 02:27.620\n And now we're coming back to this moment\n\n02:27.620 --> 02:29.980\n for space exploration where we actually have an economy\n\n02:29.980 --> 02:32.780\n and we have the other accoutrement that society needs\n\n02:32.780 --> 02:34.980\n to be able to make space exploration more real.\n\n02:34.980 --> 02:37.340\n And my dad's thrilled because finally,\n\n02:37.340 --> 02:39.980\n not nearly, I hope not anywhere near the end of his life,\n\n02:39.980 --> 02:40.920\n but as he's an older man,\n\n02:40.920 --> 02:44.480\n he now can see still within his lifetime,\n\n02:44.480 --> 02:45.540\n people really getting a chance\n\n02:45.540 --> 02:47.900\n to build a sustainable lunar settlement on the moon\n\n02:47.900 --> 02:49.180\n or maybe even go to Mars.\n\n02:49.180 --> 02:52.120\n So settlement, civilizations and other planets,\n\n02:52.120 --> 02:55.580\n that's the cool thing to dream about in the future.\n\n02:55.580 --> 02:56.820\n It certainly is.\n\n02:56.820 --> 03:00.580\n What was the favorite sci fi authors when you were growing up?\n\n03:00.580 --> 03:02.560\n Pab\u00e9 Eszeg Asimov Foundation Trilogy.\n\n03:02.560 --> 03:05.220\n This is an amazing story of Harry Seldon,\n\n03:05.220 --> 03:09.180\n this foundation that he forms at different ends of the,\n\n03:09.180 --> 03:10.860\n well, according to the story,\n\n03:10.860 --> 03:12.420\n different ends of the universe\n\n03:12.420 --> 03:16.820\n and has this interesting focus on society.\n\n03:16.820 --> 03:19.220\n So it's not just space exploration\n\n03:19.220 --> 03:21.500\n for the sake of space exploration or novel technology,\n\n03:21.500 --> 03:23.940\n which is a lot of what I work on day to day at MIT,\n\n03:23.940 --> 03:26.940\n but how do you structure a society\n\n03:27.960 --> 03:31.540\n across those vast expanses of distance and time?\n\n03:31.540 --> 03:33.640\n And so I'd say absolutely a favorite.\n\n03:33.640 --> 03:38.060\n Now though, my favorite is Neal Stephenson and Seveneves.\n\n03:38.060 --> 03:40.620\n It's a book that inspired my own PhD research\n\n03:40.620 --> 03:43.100\n and some ongoing work that we're doing with NASA now\n\n03:43.100 --> 03:46.660\n for the future of swarm robotics for spacecraft.\n\n03:46.660 --> 03:49.700\n We were saying offline about Neal Stephenson\n\n03:49.700 --> 03:51.580\n because I just recently had a conversation with him.\n\n03:51.580 --> 03:54.660\n And I said that not until I was doing the research for him\n\n03:54.660 --> 03:59.660\n that I realized he also had a role to play in Blue Origin.\n\n03:59.860 --> 04:02.760\n So it's like sci fi actually having a role to play\n\n04:02.760 --> 04:06.080\n in the design, engineering,\n\n04:06.080 --> 04:07.640\n just the implementation of ideas\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:10.860\n that kind of percolate up from the sci fi world\n\n04:10.860 --> 04:11.980\n and actually become reality.\n\n04:11.980 --> 04:14.540\n It's kind of a fascinating figure in that way.\n\n04:14.540 --> 04:16.900\n So do you also think about him\n\n04:16.900 --> 04:19.660\n beyond just his work in science fiction,\n\n04:19.660 --> 04:22.900\n but his role in coming up with wild, crazy ideas\n\n04:22.900 --> 04:24.220\n that actually become reality?\n\n04:24.220 --> 04:26.860\n Yes, I think it's a great example of this cycle\n\n04:26.860 --> 04:29.980\n between authors and scientists and engineers\n\n04:29.980 --> 04:32.100\n that we can be inspired in one generation\n\n04:32.100 --> 04:33.900\n by what authors dream up.\n\n04:33.900 --> 04:35.740\n We build it, we make it a reality.\n\n04:35.740 --> 04:37.420\n And then that inspires another generation\n\n04:37.420 --> 04:40.540\n of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction.\n\n04:40.540 --> 04:42.240\n I think Neal Stephenson does a beautiful job\n\n04:42.240 --> 04:44.740\n of being what we'd call a hard science fiction author.\n\n04:44.740 --> 04:46.500\n So it's really grounded in a lot of science,\n\n04:46.500 --> 04:47.940\n which makes it very compelling for me\n\n04:47.940 --> 04:50.140\n as a scientist and engineer to read\n\n04:50.140 --> 04:53.260\n and then be challenged to make that vision a reality.\n\n04:53.260 --> 04:56.100\n The other community that Neal's involved with\n\n04:56.100 --> 04:57.620\n and some of my other mentors are involved with\n\n04:57.620 --> 05:00.260\n that we are thinking about more and more in the work\n\n05:00.260 --> 05:03.940\n that we do at MIT is the Long Now Foundation.\n\n05:03.940 --> 05:08.860\n And this focus on what does society need to take\n\n05:08.860 --> 05:11.460\n in terms of steps at this juncture,\n\n05:11.460 --> 05:14.500\n this particular inflection point in human history\n\n05:14.500 --> 05:16.140\n to make sure that we're setting ourselves up\n\n05:16.140 --> 05:18.780\n for a long and prosperous horizon,\n\n05:18.780 --> 05:20.440\n for humanity's horizons.\n\n05:20.440 --> 05:21.340\n There's a lot of examples\n\n05:21.340 --> 05:23.860\n of what the Long Now Foundation does and thinks about.\n\n05:23.860 --> 05:25.500\n But when I think about this in my own work,\n\n05:25.500 --> 05:30.140\n it's what does it take to scale humanity's presence\n\n05:30.140 --> 05:31.740\n in orbit?\n\n05:31.740 --> 05:34.200\n We are seeing some additional investment\n\n05:34.200 --> 05:36.300\n in commercial space habitats.\n\n05:36.300 --> 05:37.660\n So it'll no longer be just NASA\n\n05:37.660 --> 05:39.420\n running the International Space Station,\n\n05:39.420 --> 05:42.860\n but to really democratize access to space,\n\n05:42.860 --> 05:44.780\n like Bezos wants to have millions of people living\n\n05:44.780 --> 05:46.020\n and working in space,\n\n05:46.020 --> 05:49.460\n you need architecture that's bigger and grander\n\n05:49.460 --> 05:50.940\n and can actually scale.\n\n05:50.940 --> 05:52.100\n That means you need to be thinking about\n\n05:52.100 --> 05:55.120\n how can you construct things for long time horizons\n\n05:55.120 --> 05:56.740\n that are really sustainable in orbit\n\n05:56.740 --> 05:59.460\n or on a surface of a celestial body\n\n05:59.460 --> 06:02.180\n that are bigger than the biggest rocket payload fairing\n\n06:02.180 --> 06:03.460\n that we currently have available.\n\n06:03.460 --> 06:05.420\n And that what led me to self assembly\n\n06:05.420 --> 06:08.300\n and other models of in space construction.\n\n06:08.300 --> 06:10.580\n Okay, every time you speak,\n\n06:10.580 --> 06:12.540\n I get like a million tangent ideas.\n\n06:12.540 --> 06:13.380\n You can cut me off.\n\n06:13.380 --> 06:15.220\n No, no, no, no, no, no, please keep talking.\n\n06:15.220 --> 06:16.140\n This is amazing.\n\n06:16.140 --> 06:19.100\n I just, there's like a million of ideas.\n\n06:19.100 --> 06:21.820\n So one sort of on the dark side, let me ask,\n\n06:21.820 --> 06:25.060\n do you think about the threats to human civilization\n\n06:25.060 --> 06:28.940\n that kind of motivate the scaling of the expansion\n\n06:28.940 --> 06:31.740\n of humans in space and on other planets?\n\n06:31.740 --> 06:32.900\n What are you worried about?\n\n06:32.900 --> 06:35.660\n Nuclear war, pandemics,\n\n06:35.660 --> 06:39.700\n super intelligent, artificial intelligence systems,\n\n06:40.820 --> 06:44.100\n more not existential crises,\n\n06:44.100 --> 06:46.360\n but ones that have significant,\n\n06:46.360 --> 06:48.760\n potentially significant detrimental effects on society,\n\n06:48.760 --> 06:51.020\n like climate change, those kinds of things.\n\n06:51.020 --> 06:52.780\n And then there's of course the fun S story\n\n06:52.780 --> 06:55.420\n coming out from the darkness and hitting all earth.\n\n06:55.420 --> 06:57.060\n There's been a few movies on that.\n\n06:57.060 --> 06:59.420\n Anyway, is there something that you think about\n\n07:00.300 --> 07:02.280\n that threatens us in this century?\n\n07:03.140 --> 07:04.520\n I mean, as an ex military family,\n\n07:04.520 --> 07:06.420\n we used to talk about all of this.\n\n07:06.420 --> 07:08.740\n We would say that luck favors the prepared.\n\n07:08.740 --> 07:13.300\n And so growing up, we had a plan, actually a family plan\n\n07:13.300 --> 07:14.460\n for what we would do in a pandemic.\n\n07:14.460 --> 07:15.540\n Didn't think we were gonna have to put that\n\n07:15.540 --> 07:17.500\n and plan into place and here we are.\n\n07:17.500 --> 07:20.780\n We do, certainly among my own family and my friends\n\n07:20.780 --> 07:21.820\n and then our work at MIT,\n\n07:21.820 --> 07:24.900\n we do think about existential threats and risks to humanity\n\n07:24.900 --> 07:27.260\n and what role does space exploration\n\n07:27.260 --> 07:29.180\n and getting humans off world have to play\n\n07:29.180 --> 07:32.100\n in a resilient future for humanity.\n\n07:32.100 --> 07:35.420\n But what I actually find more compelling recently\n\n07:35.420 --> 07:40.420\n is instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon earth\n\n07:40.540 --> 07:42.980\n through a path of space exploration or space foraging\n\n07:42.980 --> 07:44.900\n is to see how we can use space technology\n\n07:44.900 --> 07:47.260\n to keep earth livable.\n\n07:47.260 --> 07:50.020\n The obvious direct ways of doing this would be,\n\n07:50.020 --> 07:52.300\n satellite technology that's helping us learn more\n\n07:52.300 --> 07:56.260\n about climate change or emitters or CO2.\n\n07:56.260 --> 07:58.160\n But there's also a future for geo engineering\n\n07:58.160 --> 07:59.580\n that might be space based.\n\n07:59.580 --> 08:01.040\n A lot of questions that would have to be answered\n\n08:01.040 --> 08:04.940\n around that, but these are examples of pivoting our focus\n\n08:04.940 --> 08:06.940\n away from maybe the Hollywood vision of,\n\n08:06.940 --> 08:08.200\n oh, an asteroid's gonna come,\n\n08:08.200 --> 08:09.380\n we're all gonna have to escape earth\n\n08:09.380 --> 08:14.380\n to let's use our considerable technology prowess\n\n08:14.420 --> 08:16.420\n and use space technology to save earth\n\n08:16.420 --> 08:18.180\n and be very much focused on how we can have\n\n08:18.180 --> 08:20.780\n a worthwhile life for earth citizens.\n\n08:20.780 --> 08:24.020\n Even if some of us wanna go out and further venturing.\n\n08:24.020 --> 08:28.060\n Right, just the desire to explore the mysterious, yes.\n\n08:28.060 --> 08:31.500\n But also it does seem that by placing us\n\n08:31.500 --> 08:33.860\n in harsh conditions, the harsh conditions of space,\n\n08:33.860 --> 08:35.700\n the harsh conditions of planets,\n\n08:35.700 --> 08:38.020\n and the biology, the chemistry, the engineering,\n\n08:38.020 --> 08:41.540\n the robotics, the materials, all of that,\n\n08:41.540 --> 08:43.940\n that's just a nice way to come up with cool new things.\n\n08:43.940 --> 08:45.140\n Great forcing function, yeah.\n\n08:45.140 --> 08:48.500\n Yeah, exactly, it's a forcing function like survival.\n\n08:48.500 --> 08:50.960\n You don't get this right, you die.\n\n08:50.960 --> 08:53.420\n So, and that you can bring back to earth\n\n08:53.420 --> 08:57.920\n and it will improve, like figuring out food in space\n\n08:57.920 --> 09:01.860\n will make you figure out how to eat,\n\n09:01.860 --> 09:04.140\n live healthier lives here on earth.\n\n09:04.140 --> 09:05.900\n So true, I mean, some of the technologies\n\n09:05.900 --> 09:08.700\n that we're directly looking at right now\n\n09:08.700 --> 09:12.080\n for space habitats, it's hard to keep humans alive\n\n09:12.080 --> 09:15.620\n in this really fragile little pocket against the vacuum\n\n09:15.620 --> 09:19.060\n and all of the dangers that the space environment presents.\n\n09:19.060 --> 09:20.900\n Some of the technologies we are gonna have to figure out\n\n09:20.900 --> 09:24.700\n is energy efficient cooling and air conditioning,\n\n09:24.700 --> 09:28.900\n air filtration, scrubbing CO2 from the air,\n\n09:28.900 --> 09:33.900\n being able to have habitats that are themselves resilient\n\n09:34.220 --> 09:36.340\n to extremes of space weather and radiation.\n\n09:36.340 --> 09:39.340\n And some of these are direct translational opportunities\n\n09:39.340 --> 09:41.740\n for areas turned by natural disasters.\n\n09:41.740 --> 09:43.740\n People in California a decade ago would never have had\n\n09:43.740 --> 09:45.860\n to think about having an airtight house.\n\n09:45.860 --> 09:48.800\n But now with wildfires, maybe you do want something close\n\n09:48.800 --> 09:51.520\n to an airtight house, how do you manage that?\n\n09:51.520 --> 09:52.760\n There's a lot of technologies\n\n09:52.760 --> 09:55.060\n from the space habitation world\n\n09:55.060 --> 09:57.020\n that we are hoping we can actually bring back down\n\n09:57.020 --> 09:58.660\n to benefit life on earth as well\n\n09:58.660 --> 10:01.220\n in these extreme environment contexts.\n\n10:01.220 --> 10:05.860\n Okay, so you mentioned to go back to swarm.\n\n10:05.860 --> 10:06.700\n Yeah.\n\n10:06.700 --> 10:09.120\n So that was interesting to you,\n\n10:09.120 --> 10:10.380\n first of all, in your own work,\n\n10:10.380 --> 10:12.620\n but also I believe you said something\n\n10:12.620 --> 10:14.900\n that was inspiring from Niel Stevenson as well.\n\n10:14.900 --> 10:19.420\n So when you say swarm, are you thinking about\n\n10:19.420 --> 10:24.300\n architectures or are you thinking about\n\n10:24.300 --> 10:26.040\n artificial intelligence like robotics\n\n10:26.040 --> 10:28.380\n or are those kind of intermixed?\n\n10:28.380 --> 10:30.180\n I think the future that we're seeing\n\n10:30.180 --> 10:31.780\n is that they're going to be intermixed,\n\n10:31.780 --> 10:33.160\n which is really exciting.\n\n10:33.160 --> 10:35.220\n So the future of space habitats\n\n10:35.220 --> 10:38.580\n are one of intelligent structures,\n\n10:38.580 --> 10:39.960\n maybe not all the way to Hal\n\n10:39.960 --> 10:43.220\n and the 2001 Space Odyssey reference that scares people\n\n10:43.220 --> 10:45.820\n about the habitat having a mind of its own.\n\n10:45.820 --> 10:47.820\n But certainly we're building systems now\n\n10:47.820 --> 10:51.800\n where the habitat has sensing technology\n\n10:51.800 --> 10:56.380\n that allows it to communicate its basic functions,\n\n10:56.380 --> 10:58.340\n maintaining life support for the astronauts,\n\n10:58.340 --> 11:01.500\n but could also communicate in symbiosis\n\n11:01.500 --> 11:03.220\n with these swarm robots\n\n11:03.220 --> 11:05.700\n that would be on the outside of the spacecraft,\n\n11:05.700 --> 11:08.140\n whether it's in a microgravity orbiting environment\n\n11:08.140 --> 11:09.220\n or on the surface.\n\n11:09.220 --> 11:10.460\n And these little robots,\n\n11:10.460 --> 11:13.320\n they crawl just a la Niel Stevenson in seven eves,\n\n11:13.320 --> 11:15.460\n they crawl along the outside of the spacecraft\n\n11:15.460 --> 11:18.180\n looking for micrometeorite punctures\n\n11:18.180 --> 11:21.620\n or gas leaks or other faults and defects.\n\n11:21.620 --> 11:24.020\n And right now we're just working on the diagnosis.\n\n11:24.020 --> 11:27.260\n So can the swarm with its collective intelligence\n\n11:27.260 --> 11:30.220\n act in symbiosis with the spacecraft and detect things?\n\n11:30.220 --> 11:31.280\n But in the future we'd also love\n\n11:31.280 --> 11:34.100\n for these little micro robots to repair in situ\n\n11:34.100 --> 11:37.620\n and really be like ants living in a tree\n\n11:37.620 --> 11:39.460\n altogether connected to the spacecraft.\n\n11:39.460 --> 11:44.260\n Do you envision the system to be fully distributed\n\n11:44.260 --> 11:45.820\n and just like an ant colony,\n\n11:45.820 --> 11:50.640\n if one of them is damaged or whatever,\n\n11:51.900 --> 11:53.520\n loses control and all those kinds of things\n\n11:53.520 --> 11:57.340\n that doesn't affect the performance of the complete system\n\n11:57.340 --> 11:58.960\n or doesn't need to be centralized?\n\n11:58.960 --> 12:01.140\n This is more like almost like a technical question.\n\n12:01.140 --> 12:01.980\n Do you think we can?\n\n12:01.980 --> 12:03.020\n Good architecture question.\n\n12:03.020 --> 12:05.860\n Right, from the ground up,\n\n12:05.860 --> 12:08.820\n it's so scary to go fully distributed.\n\n12:08.820 --> 12:10.140\n Yes.\n\n12:10.140 --> 12:12.700\n But it's also exceptionally powerful, right?\n\n12:12.700 --> 12:15.860\n Robust, resilient to the harsh conditions of space.\n\n12:15.860 --> 12:20.860\n What do you, if you look into the next 10, 20, 100 years,\n\n12:22.300 --> 12:23.460\n starting from scratch,\n\n12:23.460 --> 12:24.620\n do you think we should be doing\n\n12:24.620 --> 12:27.180\n architecture wise distributed systems?\n\n12:28.040 --> 12:31.300\n For space, yes, because it gives you this redundancy\n\n12:31.300 --> 12:33.380\n and safety profile that's really critical.\n\n12:33.380 --> 12:35.140\n So whether it's small swarm robots\n\n12:35.140 --> 12:37.300\n where it doesn't matter if you lose a few of them,\n\n12:37.300 --> 12:43.820\n to habitats that instead of having a central monolithic habitat,\n\n12:43.820 --> 12:45.780\n you might actually be able to have\n\n12:45.780 --> 12:49.060\n a decentralized node of a space station\n\n12:49.060 --> 12:50.980\n so that you can kind of right out of Star Wars,\n\n12:50.980 --> 12:53.300\n you can shut a blast door if there's a fire\n\n12:53.300 --> 12:55.060\n or if there's a conflict in a certain area\n\n12:55.060 --> 12:57.180\n and you can move the humans and the crew\n\n12:57.180 --> 12:59.820\n into another decentralized node of the spacecraft.\n\n12:59.820 --> 13:01.980\n There's another idea out of Neal Stephenson's Seven Eves\n\n13:01.980 --> 13:03.820\n actually where these arclets,\n\n13:03.820 --> 13:06.180\n which were decentralized spacecraft that could form\n\n13:06.180 --> 13:09.980\n and dock little temporary space stations with each other\n\n13:09.980 --> 13:12.140\n and then separate and go off on their way\n\n13:12.140 --> 13:15.900\n and have a decentralized approach to living in space.\n\n13:15.900 --> 13:19.100\n So the self assembly component of that too,\n\n13:19.100 --> 13:21.780\n so this is your PhD work and beyond,\n\n13:21.780 --> 13:25.420\n you explored autonomously self assembling space architecture\n\n13:25.420 --> 13:28.220\n for future space, tourists, habitats,\n\n13:28.220 --> 13:31.420\n and space stations in orbit around Earth, Moon, and Mars.\n\n13:31.420 --> 13:34.660\n There's few things I personally find sexier\n\n13:34.660 --> 13:39.660\n than autonomously self assembling space architecture.\n\n13:40.980 --> 13:42.740\n In general, it doesn't even need to be space.\n\n13:42.740 --> 13:46.100\n The idea of self assembling architectures\n\n13:46.100 --> 13:48.420\n is really interesting, like building a bridge\n\n13:48.420 --> 13:51.580\n or something like that through self assembling materials.\n\n13:51.580 --> 13:56.580\n It feels like an incredibly efficient way to do it\n\n13:57.340 --> 13:59.860\n because optimization is built in.\n\n13:59.860 --> 14:03.180\n So you can build the most optimal structures\n\n14:03.180 --> 14:08.180\n given dynamic, uncertain, changing conditions.\n\n14:09.060 --> 14:11.340\n So maybe can you talk about your PhD work,\n\n14:11.340 --> 14:16.340\n about this work, about Tesserae, what is it in general?\n\n14:17.380 --> 14:19.420\n Any cool stuff, because this is super cool.\n\n14:19.420 --> 14:21.100\n Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n14:21.100 --> 14:23.700\n So Tesserae is my PhD research.\n\n14:23.700 --> 14:26.820\n It's this idea that we could take tiles\n\n14:26.820 --> 14:30.020\n that construct a large structure like a bucky ball.\n\n14:30.020 --> 14:31.860\n Yeah, this is exactly what we're looking at here,\n\n14:31.860 --> 14:34.700\n which is the tiles that are packed flat in a rocket.\n\n14:34.700 --> 14:38.380\n They're released to float in microgravity.\n\n14:38.380 --> 14:41.220\n Magnets, pretty powerful, electropermanent magnets\n\n14:41.220 --> 14:44.460\n on their edges draw them together for autonomous docking.\n\n14:44.460 --> 14:46.100\n So there's no human in the loop here,\n\n14:46.100 --> 14:48.180\n and there's no central agent coordinating\n\n14:48.180 --> 14:50.740\n saying tile one, go to tile two.\n\n14:50.740 --> 14:52.500\n It's completely decentralized system.\n\n14:52.500 --> 14:54.820\n They find each other on their own.\n\n14:54.820 --> 14:56.060\n What we don't show in this video\n\n14:56.060 --> 14:58.220\n is what happens if there's an error, right?\n\n14:58.220 --> 15:00.140\n So what happens if they bond incorrectly?\n\n15:00.140 --> 15:02.620\n The tiles have sensing, so proximity sensing,\n\n15:02.620 --> 15:04.780\n magnetometer, other sensors that allow them\n\n15:04.780 --> 15:07.900\n to detect a good bond versus a bad bond\n\n15:07.900 --> 15:10.020\n and pulse off and self correct,\n\n15:10.020 --> 15:12.700\n which anybody who works in the field of self assembly\n\n15:12.700 --> 15:15.780\n will tell you that error detection and correction,\n\n15:15.780 --> 15:19.020\n just like error detection in a DNA sequence\n\n15:19.020 --> 15:21.900\n or protein folding is really important part of the system\n\n15:21.900 --> 15:23.140\n for that robustness.\n\n15:23.140 --> 15:26.380\n And so we've done a lot of work to engineer that ability\n\n15:26.380 --> 15:29.300\n for the tiles to be self determining.\n\n15:29.300 --> 15:30.820\n They know whether they're forming the structure\n\n15:30.820 --> 15:32.180\n that they're supposed to form or not.\n\n15:32.180 --> 15:34.340\n They know if they're in a toxic relationship\n\n15:34.340 --> 15:35.780\n and they need to get out.\n\n15:35.780 --> 15:38.700\n Right, right, if they need to separate, exactly, yeah.\n\n15:38.700 --> 15:40.500\n All right, this is like so amazing.\n\n15:40.500 --> 15:41.980\n And for people who are just listening to this,\n\n15:41.980 --> 15:45.180\n yeah, there's, I mean, how large are these tiles?\n\n15:45.180 --> 15:47.780\n So the size that we use in the lab,\n\n15:47.780 --> 15:49.140\n they can really be any size\n\n15:49.140 --> 15:51.020\n because we can scale them down to do testing\n\n15:51.020 --> 15:51.860\n in microgravity.\n\n15:51.860 --> 15:55.020\n So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide\n\n15:55.020 --> 15:57.100\n to the International Space Station a couple years ago\n\n15:57.100 --> 16:00.100\n to test the code, test the state machine,\n\n16:00.100 --> 16:02.260\n test the algorithm of self assembly.\n\n16:02.260 --> 16:03.500\n But now we're actually building\n\n16:03.500 --> 16:05.660\n our first ever human scale tiles.\n\n16:05.660 --> 16:06.860\n They're me human size.\n\n16:06.860 --> 16:09.660\n So a little smaller than maybe your average human,\n\n16:09.660 --> 16:13.980\n but they're 2.5 feet on edge length.\n\n16:13.980 --> 16:16.700\n The larger scale that we would love to build in the future\n\n16:16.700 --> 16:18.700\n would actually be tiles that are big enough\n\n16:18.700 --> 16:21.900\n to form a bucky ball, big open spherical volume,\n\n16:21.900 --> 16:23.580\n spherical approximation volume,\n\n16:23.580 --> 16:25.660\n that'd be about 10 meters in diameter.\n\n16:25.660 --> 16:29.100\n So 30 feet, which is much bigger and grander\n\n16:29.100 --> 16:32.540\n in terms of open space than any current module on the ISS.\n\n16:32.540 --> 16:35.140\n And one of the goals of this project was to say,\n\n16:35.140 --> 16:38.780\n what's the purpose of next generation space architecture?\n\n16:38.780 --> 16:41.660\n Should it be something that really inspires\n\n16:41.660 --> 16:44.780\n and delights people when you float into that space?\n\n16:44.780 --> 16:46.700\n Can you get goosebumps in the way that you do\n\n16:46.700 --> 16:48.740\n when you walk into a really stunning piece\n\n16:48.740 --> 16:50.180\n of architecture on earth?\n\n16:50.180 --> 16:52.260\n And so we think that self assembly,\n\n16:52.260 --> 16:55.300\n this modular reconfigurable algorithm\n\n16:55.300 --> 16:58.060\n for constructing space structures in orbit\n\n16:58.060 --> 17:01.300\n is gonna give us this promise of space architecture\n\n17:01.300 --> 17:03.460\n that's actually worth living in.\n\n17:03.460 --> 17:05.340\n Living in, oh, I thought you also meant\n\n17:05.340 --> 17:07.340\n from like outside artistic perspective,\n\n17:07.340 --> 17:09.660\n when you see the whole thing is just.\n\n17:09.660 --> 17:11.460\n With the aesthetics of it, absolutely.\n\n17:11.460 --> 17:14.460\n You know, when you like go like into Vegas,\n\n17:14.460 --> 17:16.460\n whenever you go into a city\n\n17:16.460 --> 17:19.340\n and it like over the hill appears in front of you.\n\n17:19.340 --> 17:23.380\n And I mean, there's something majestic about seeing like,\n\n17:23.380 --> 17:25.300\n wow, humans created that.\n\n17:25.300 --> 17:26.820\n It gives you like hope about like,\n\n17:26.820 --> 17:28.780\n if these a bunch of ants were able to figure out\n\n17:28.780 --> 17:31.420\n how to build skyscrapers that light up.\n\n17:31.420 --> 17:33.980\n And in general, the design of these tiles\n\n17:33.980 --> 17:36.460\n in the way you envision it are pretty scalable.\n\n17:36.460 --> 17:38.460\n Yes, and they're inspired by exactly\n\n17:38.460 --> 17:39.540\n what you mentioned a moment ago,\n\n17:39.540 --> 17:42.980\n which is we have these patterns of self assembly on earth.\n\n17:42.980 --> 17:45.020\n And there's a lot of fantastic MIT research\n\n17:45.020 --> 17:46.500\n that we're building this concept on.\n\n17:46.500 --> 17:49.380\n So like Daniela Ruse at CSAIL and Pebbles,\n\n17:49.380 --> 17:53.860\n taking the power of magnets to create units\n\n17:53.860 --> 17:56.180\n that are themselves interchangeable,\n\n17:56.180 --> 17:58.620\n this notion of programmable matter.\n\n17:58.620 --> 18:01.580\n And so we're interested in going really big with it\n\n18:01.580 --> 18:05.340\n to build big scale space structures with programmable tiles.\n\n18:05.340 --> 18:07.340\n But there's also a really fascinating,\n\n18:07.340 --> 18:08.940\n you know, end of that on the other side of the spectrum,\n\n18:08.940 --> 18:11.380\n which is how small can you go with matter\n\n18:11.380 --> 18:13.780\n that's programmable and stacks and builds itself\n\n18:13.780 --> 18:16.860\n and creates a bridge or something in the future.\n\n18:16.860 --> 18:19.540\n What do you envision the thing would look like?\n\n18:19.540 --> 18:22.300\n Like when you imagine a thing far into the future\n\n18:22.300 --> 18:25.900\n where there's, so we're not even thinking about\n\n18:25.900 --> 18:28.980\n like small space, well, let's not call them small,\n\n18:28.980 --> 18:30.780\n but our currently sized space stations,\n\n18:30.780 --> 18:34.260\n but like something gigantic, what do you envision?\n\n18:34.260 --> 18:36.620\n Is this something with symmetry\n\n18:36.620 --> 18:38.860\n or is this something we can't even come up with yet?\n\n18:38.860 --> 18:42.900\n Is there beautiful structures that you imagine in your mind?\n\n18:42.900 --> 18:45.740\n I've got three candidates that I would love to build.\n\n18:45.740 --> 18:48.700\n If we're talking about monumental space architecture,\n\n18:48.700 --> 18:51.740\n one is what does a space cathedral look like?\n\n18:51.740 --> 18:52.860\n It can be a secular cathedral,\n\n18:52.860 --> 18:54.460\n doesn't necessarily have to be about religion,\n\n18:54.460 --> 18:57.980\n but that notion of long sight lines,\n\n18:57.980 --> 19:01.260\n inspiring, stunning architecture when you go in.\n\n19:01.260 --> 19:03.860\n And you can imagine floating instead of, you know,\n\n19:03.860 --> 19:07.300\n being on the ground and only looking up in space,\n\n19:07.300 --> 19:08.740\n you could be in a central node\n\n19:08.740 --> 19:10.740\n and each direction you look at,\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:14.100\n all the cardinal directions are spires going off\n\n19:14.100 --> 19:15.420\n in a really large and long way.\n\n19:15.420 --> 19:17.180\n So that's concept number one.\n\n19:17.180 --> 19:19.980\n Number two would be something more organic\n\n19:19.980 --> 19:21.780\n that's not just geometric.\n\n19:21.780 --> 19:24.420\n So here, one of the ideas that we're working on at MIT\n\n19:24.420 --> 19:27.580\n in my lab is to say, could you,\n\n19:27.580 --> 19:29.260\n instead of the tesserae model, right,\n\n19:29.260 --> 19:31.900\n which is self assembling a shell,\n\n19:31.900 --> 19:34.980\n could you define a module that's a node,\n\n19:34.980 --> 19:36.940\n a small node that someone can live in\n\n19:36.940 --> 19:39.660\n and you self assemble a lot of those together,\n\n19:39.660 --> 19:43.620\n they're called plesiohedrons like space filling solids\n\n19:43.620 --> 19:45.580\n and you dock a bunch of them together\n\n19:45.580 --> 19:49.820\n and you can create a really organic structure out of that.\n\n19:49.820 --> 19:53.460\n So this is the same way that muscles accrete to appear,\n\n19:53.460 --> 19:55.580\n you can have these nodes that dock together\n\n19:55.580 --> 19:57.660\n and one shape that I would love to form out of this\n\n19:57.660 --> 20:00.460\n is something like a nautilus, a seashell,\n\n20:00.460 --> 20:03.500\n that beautiful, you know, fibonacci spiral sequence\n\n20:03.500 --> 20:04.940\n that you get in that shape,\n\n20:04.940 --> 20:06.180\n which I think would be a stunning\n\n20:06.180 --> 20:10.300\n and fabulous aggregated space station.\n\n20:10.300 --> 20:14.180\n You said so many cool words, plesiohedron.\n\n20:14.180 --> 20:15.020\n Yeah, plesiohedron.\n\n20:15.020 --> 20:18.220\n So that's a space filling.\n\n20:18.220 --> 20:20.980\n Solid, the simplest thing to think of is like a cube.\n\n20:20.980 --> 20:21.980\n Oh, cube. A cube, right?\n\n20:21.980 --> 20:23.620\n So you can stack cubes together\n\n20:23.620 --> 20:25.380\n and if you had an infinite number of cubes,\n\n20:25.380 --> 20:27.140\n you'd fill all that space,\n\n20:27.140 --> 20:28.900\n there's no gaps in between the cubes,\n\n20:28.900 --> 20:31.340\n they stack and fill space.\n\n20:31.340 --> 20:34.660\n Another plesiohedron is a truncated octahedron\n\n20:34.660 --> 20:36.420\n and that's actually one of the candidate structures\n\n20:36.420 --> 20:38.660\n that we think would be great for space stations.\n\n20:38.660 --> 20:40.020\n What's the truncated part?\n\n20:40.020 --> 20:41.820\n Ah, so you cut off,\n\n20:41.820 --> 20:44.540\n an octahedron actually has little pointy areas,\n\n20:44.540 --> 20:46.260\n you truncate certain sections of it\n\n20:46.260 --> 20:50.020\n and you get surfaces that are on the structure\n\n20:50.020 --> 20:52.820\n that are cubes and I think hexagons,\n\n20:52.820 --> 20:55.540\n I have to remind myself exactly what the faces are.\n\n20:55.540 --> 20:59.180\n But overall, a truncated octahedron can be bonded\n\n20:59.180 --> 21:00.700\n to other truncated octahedrons\n\n21:00.700 --> 21:03.500\n and just like a cube, it fills all the gaps\n\n21:03.500 --> 21:04.820\n as you build it out.\n\n21:04.820 --> 21:07.700\n So you can imagine two truncated octahedrons,\n\n21:07.700 --> 21:09.180\n they come together at an airlock,\n\n21:09.180 --> 21:12.260\n which is what we space people call doors in space\n\n21:12.260 --> 21:14.180\n and you dock them on all sides\n\n21:14.180 --> 21:18.060\n and you've basically created this decentralized network\n\n21:18.060 --> 21:21.980\n of space nodes that make a big space station\n\n21:21.980 --> 21:23.620\n and once you have enough of them\n\n21:23.620 --> 21:25.460\n and you're growing with enough big units,\n\n21:25.460 --> 21:28.020\n you can do it in any macro shape you want.\n\n21:28.020 --> 21:29.300\n That's where the Nautilus comes in,\n\n21:29.300 --> 21:32.940\n is could we design an organically inspired shape\n\n21:32.940 --> 21:34.220\n for a space station?\n\n21:34.220 --> 21:36.820\n Can I just say how awesome it is to hear you say,\n\n21:36.820 --> 21:38.700\n we space people.\n\n21:38.700 --> 21:41.220\n I know you meant people that are doing research\n\n21:41.220 --> 21:43.820\n on space exploration, space technology,\n\n21:43.820 --> 21:45.940\n but it also made me think of a future.\n\n21:45.940 --> 21:50.580\n There's earth people and there's those space people.\n\n21:50.580 --> 21:51.420\n And then there's the Mars people.\n\n21:51.420 --> 21:52.380\n I'd love to unite those too.\n\n21:52.380 --> 21:54.140\n Yeah, no, no, for sure, for sure.\n\n21:54.140 --> 21:58.620\n But like, it's like New Yorkers and like Texans\n\n21:58.620 --> 22:00.500\n or something like that.\n\n22:00.500 --> 22:03.540\n Yeah, of course you live for a time in New York\n\n22:03.540 --> 22:05.140\n and then you go up to Boston\n\n22:05.140 --> 22:07.100\n but for a time you're the space people.\n\n22:07.100 --> 22:09.300\n Oh, I know those space people.\n\n22:09.300 --> 22:11.140\n They're kind of wild up there.\n\n22:11.140 --> 22:12.500\n We'll see how that dynamic evolves.\n\n22:12.500 --> 22:13.340\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n22:13.340 --> 22:14.660\n There's that culture, culture forms.\n\n22:14.660 --> 22:17.020\n And I would love to see what kind of culture,\n\n22:17.020 --> 22:21.100\n once you have sort of more and more civilians.\n\n22:21.100 --> 22:22.500\n I mean, there's a human,\n\n22:22.500 --> 22:24.420\n I mean, I love psychology and sociology\n\n22:24.420 --> 22:27.540\n and I'll maybe ask you about that too,\n\n22:27.540 --> 22:29.580\n which is like the dynamic between humans.\n\n22:29.580 --> 22:31.700\n You have to kind of start considering that\n\n22:31.700 --> 22:34.660\n and you start spending more and more time up in space\n\n22:34.660 --> 22:37.660\n and start sending civilians, start sending bigger\n\n22:37.660 --> 22:39.140\n and bigger groups of people.\n\n22:39.140 --> 22:42.900\n And then of course the beautiful and the ugly emerges\n\n22:42.900 --> 22:47.380\n from the human nature that we haven't been able\n\n22:47.380 --> 22:49.020\n to escape up to this point.\n\n22:49.020 --> 22:53.060\n But when you say the plesiohedrons, these kinds of shapes,\n\n22:53.060 --> 22:54.500\n are they multifunctional?\n\n22:54.500 --> 22:56.700\n Like is the idea you'd be able to,\n\n22:58.620 --> 23:02.220\n humans can occupy them safely in some of them\n\n23:02.220 --> 23:04.820\n and some others have some other purposes?\n\n23:04.820 --> 23:05.660\n Exactly.\n\n23:05.660 --> 23:07.300\n One could be sleeping quarters.\n\n23:07.300 --> 23:10.380\n One could be a greenhouse or an agricultural unit.\n\n23:10.380 --> 23:13.740\n One could be a storage depot.\n\n23:13.740 --> 23:15.660\n Essentially all of the different rooms\n\n23:15.660 --> 23:17.860\n or functions that you might need in a space station\n\n23:17.860 --> 23:19.940\n could be subdivided into these nodes\n\n23:19.940 --> 23:22.220\n and then stacked together.\n\n23:22.220 --> 23:24.460\n And one of the promises of both Tesseray,\n\n23:24.460 --> 23:26.940\n my original PhD research, which is these shells,\n\n23:26.940 --> 23:29.540\n and then this follow on node concept,\n\n23:29.540 --> 23:32.100\n is that right now we build space stations\n\n23:32.100 --> 23:33.780\n and once they're built, they're done.\n\n23:33.780 --> 23:36.260\n You can't really change them profoundly.\n\n23:36.260 --> 23:38.940\n But the benefit of a modular self assembling system\n\n23:38.940 --> 23:40.940\n is you can disassemble it.\n\n23:40.940 --> 23:42.780\n You can completely reconfigure it.\n\n23:42.780 --> 23:45.140\n So if your mission changes or the number of people\n\n23:45.140 --> 23:46.340\n in space that you wanna host,\n\n23:46.340 --> 23:47.740\n if you have a space conference happening\n\n23:47.740 --> 23:48.860\n like South by Southwest.\n\n23:48.860 --> 23:50.100\n I was thinking space party,\n\n23:50.100 --> 23:52.460\n but space conference is good too.\n\n23:52.460 --> 23:55.660\n Then maybe all of a sudden you want to change out\n\n23:55.660 --> 23:58.700\n what were window tiles yesterday, cupola tiles,\n\n23:58.700 --> 24:00.460\n and make them into a birthing port\n\n24:00.460 --> 24:02.540\n so that you can welcome five new spaceships\n\n24:02.540 --> 24:04.260\n to come and join you in space.\n\n24:04.260 --> 24:07.260\n That's what this promise of reconfigurable space architecture\n\n24:07.260 --> 24:09.060\n might allow us to explore.\n\n24:09.060 --> 24:10.660\n I've been hanging out with Grimes recently\n\n24:10.660 --> 24:13.180\n and I just feel like she belongs up in space.\n\n24:13.180 --> 24:15.460\n This is like designed for artists essentially.\n\n24:15.460 --> 24:18.140\n Like imagine, I mean, this is what South by\n\n24:18.140 --> 24:20.220\n keeps introducing me to is there's like\n\n24:20.220 --> 24:23.420\n the weird and the beautiful people and like the artists.\n\n24:23.420 --> 24:26.300\n And it feels like there's a lot of opportunities\n\n24:26.300 --> 24:28.660\n for art and design.\n\n24:28.660 --> 24:29.500\n 100%.\n\n24:29.500 --> 24:32.540\n It's like space is a combination of arts, design,\n\n24:32.540 --> 24:34.100\n and great engineering.\n\n24:36.820 --> 24:39.780\n It's safety critical with like the highest of stakes.\n\n24:39.780 --> 24:41.740\n So don't, you can't mess it up.\n\n24:41.740 --> 24:43.220\n And is this, is there, first of all,\n\n24:43.220 --> 24:44.660\n you're talking about tiling.\n\n24:44.660 --> 24:46.620\n So Neil Stephenson is obsessed about tile.\n\n24:46.620 --> 24:48.780\n I don't know if it's related to any of this,\n\n24:48.780 --> 24:50.620\n but he seems to be obsessed with like,\n\n24:50.620 --> 24:51.660\n how do you tile a space?\n\n24:51.660 --> 24:54.060\n That's like a mathematical, geometric notion.\n\n24:54.060 --> 24:55.060\n Like the tessellation.\n\n24:55.060 --> 24:59.540\n And it's, I mean, it's a beautiful idea for architecture\n\n24:59.540 --> 25:03.380\n that you can self assemble these different shapes\n\n25:03.380 --> 25:07.460\n and you can have probably some centralized guidance\n\n25:07.460 --> 25:09.700\n of the kind of thing you want to build.\n\n25:09.700 --> 25:12.020\n But they also kind of figure stuff out themselves\n\n25:12.020 --> 25:13.540\n in terms of the low level details,\n\n25:13.540 --> 25:15.980\n in terms of the figuring out when the,\n\n25:15.980 --> 25:19.700\n when everything fits just right for the OCD people,\n\n25:19.700 --> 25:23.060\n like what's that subreddit?\n\n25:23.060 --> 25:25.660\n Pleasantly, it's like really fun.\n\n25:25.660 --> 25:27.380\n Everything, they have like videos of everything\n\n25:27.380 --> 25:29.580\n is just pleasant when everything just fits perfectly.\n\n25:29.580 --> 25:30.420\n Very pleasing.\n\n25:30.420 --> 25:32.540\n All the tolerances come together well, yeah.\n\n25:32.540 --> 25:34.420\n So they figure that out on themselves\n\n25:34.420 --> 25:36.340\n and the local robotics problem.\n\n25:36.340 --> 25:39.340\n But by the way, what's the Pebbles Project?\n\n25:39.340 --> 25:41.540\n The Pebbles Project are little cubes\n\n25:41.540 --> 25:44.260\n that have EPMs in them, electropermanent magnets,\n\n25:44.260 --> 25:46.140\n and they can self disassemble.\n\n25:46.140 --> 25:47.100\n So they'll turn off.\n\n25:47.100 --> 25:48.340\n And so you'll have this little structure\n\n25:48.340 --> 25:51.660\n that all of a sudden can flip the little pebbles over\n\n25:51.660 --> 25:54.540\n and essentially just disaggregate.\n\n25:54.540 --> 25:56.620\n They have to make some pleasing sounds.\n\n25:56.620 --> 25:57.460\n Yes, they do.\n\n25:57.460 --> 26:01.380\n And that's gonna, so I'm supposed to talk to Danielle,\n\n26:01.380 --> 26:02.900\n so I'll probably spend an hour\n\n26:02.900 --> 26:04.980\n just discussing the sounds on the pebbles.\n\n26:04.980 --> 26:07.540\n Okay, what were we talking about?\n\n26:07.540 --> 26:10.940\n So that's, because you mentioned two, I think.\n\n26:10.940 --> 26:12.060\n Right, my third one.\n\n26:12.060 --> 26:13.220\n Yeah, is there a third one?\n\n26:13.220 --> 26:14.580\n My third one is The Ringworld,\n\n26:14.580 --> 26:17.300\n just because every science fiction book ever\n\n26:17.300 --> 26:19.820\n that's worth anything has A Ringworld in it.\n\n26:19.820 --> 26:21.860\n Is it like a donut?\n\n26:21.860 --> 26:24.460\n A donut, yeah, it's a really big torus\n\n26:24.460 --> 26:27.620\n that could encircle a planet\n\n26:27.620 --> 26:29.580\n or encircle another celestial body,\n\n26:29.580 --> 26:32.100\n maybe an asteroid or a small moon.\n\n26:32.100 --> 26:36.060\n And the promise here is just the beauty\n\n26:36.060 --> 26:39.900\n of being able to have that geometry in orbit\n\n26:39.900 --> 26:43.140\n and all that surface area for solar panels and docking\n\n26:43.140 --> 26:46.540\n and essentially just all of what that enables\n\n26:46.540 --> 26:48.940\n to have a ring world at that scale in orbit.\n\n26:48.940 --> 26:51.540\n By the way, for the viewers, we're looking at Figure 11.\n\n26:51.540 --> 26:52.580\n What paper is this from?\n\n26:52.580 --> 26:54.820\n This is a hexagonal tiling\n\n26:54.820 --> 26:57.340\n of a torus generated in Mathematica\n\n26:57.340 --> 27:01.060\n referencing code and approach from two citations.\n\n27:01.060 --> 27:04.220\n So we're looking at a tiled donut, and I'm now hungry.\n\n27:04.220 --> 27:06.940\n So this is the, is this from your thesis or no?\n\n27:06.940 --> 27:08.740\n This is probably, I mean, this is in my thesis.\n\n27:08.740 --> 27:10.580\n This looks like it was one of my earlier papers.\n\n27:10.580 --> 27:13.260\n This was an approach to say, great,\n\n27:13.260 --> 27:15.460\n we've come up with this tessellation approach\n\n27:15.460 --> 27:18.120\n for a buckyball, and we picked the buckyball\n\n27:18.120 --> 27:21.340\n because it is the most efficient surface area\n\n27:21.340 --> 27:23.940\n to volume shape and what's expensive in space,\n\n27:23.940 --> 27:26.340\n the surface area shipping up all that material.\n\n27:26.340 --> 27:28.780\n So we wanted something that would maximize the volume.\n\n27:28.780 --> 27:30.820\n But if we think about ring worlds and other shapes,\n\n27:30.820 --> 27:34.060\n we wanted to look at how do you tile a torus?\n\n27:34.060 --> 27:36.420\n And this is one example with hexagons\n\n27:36.420 --> 27:39.120\n to be able to say, could we take this same tesserae approach\n\n27:39.120 --> 27:42.180\n of self assembling tiles and create other geometries?\n\n27:42.180 --> 27:43.540\n This is so freaking cool.\n\n27:43.540 --> 27:44.360\n That's awesome.\n\n27:44.360 --> 27:48.420\n So you mentioned microgravity, and I saw,\n\n27:48.420 --> 27:50.180\n I believe that there's a picture\n\n27:50.180 --> 27:52.020\n of you floating in microgravity.\n\n27:52.020 --> 27:53.740\n When did you get to experience that?\n\n27:53.740 --> 27:54.580\n What was that like?\n\n27:54.580 --> 27:56.920\n Ah, so I've flown nine times\n\n27:56.920 --> 27:59.980\n on the affectionately known as the Vomit Comet.\n\n27:59.980 --> 28:02.500\n It's the parabolic flight, and essentially,\n\n28:02.500 --> 28:04.300\n it does what you'd want a plane never to do.\n\n28:04.300 --> 28:07.060\n It pitches really steeply upwards at 45 degrees.\n\n28:07.060 --> 28:07.900\n Oh, that's a picture of you.\n\n28:07.900 --> 28:09.540\n Yeah, yeah, that's tesserae.\n\n28:09.540 --> 28:11.300\n That's super early in my PhD,\n\n28:11.300 --> 28:12.800\n some of just the passive tiles\n\n28:12.800 --> 28:14.260\n before we even put electronics in.\n\n28:14.260 --> 28:17.100\n We were just testing the magnet polarity\n\n28:17.100 --> 28:20.900\n and the, essentially, is it an energy favorable structure\n\n28:20.900 --> 28:22.260\n to self assemble on its own?\n\n28:22.260 --> 28:23.900\n So we tweaked a lot of things between.\n\n28:23.900 --> 28:25.940\n Are we looking at a couple of them?\n\n28:25.940 --> 28:27.260\n Yeah, you're looking at a bunch of them there.\n\n28:27.260 --> 28:28.100\n Oh, oh, I see.\n\n28:28.100 --> 28:29.260\n Almost 32 of them, yeah.\n\n28:29.260 --> 28:30.100\n Cool.\n\n28:30.100 --> 28:31.660\n They're clumping, they're clumping, yeah.\n\n28:31.660 --> 28:33.140\n Can you comment on what's the difference\n\n28:33.140 --> 28:35.900\n between microgravity and zero gravity?\n\n28:35.900 --> 28:37.980\n Yes, so there is, is that an important difference?\n\n28:37.980 --> 28:38.820\n It's an important difference.\n\n28:38.820 --> 28:41.580\n There is no zero gravity.\n\n28:41.580 --> 28:43.740\n There's no nothing, there's, in the universe,\n\n28:43.740 --> 28:46.000\n there is no such thing as zero gravity.\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:48.180\n So Newton's law of gravity tells us\n\n28:48.180 --> 28:50.280\n that there's always gravity attraction\n\n28:50.280 --> 28:51.300\n between any two objects.\n\n28:51.300 --> 28:54.240\n So zero G is a shorthand that some of us fall into using,\n\n28:54.240 --> 28:56.420\n where it's a little easier to communicate to the public.\n\n28:56.420 --> 28:59.420\n The accurate term is microgravity,\n\n28:59.420 --> 29:02.040\n where you are essentially floating, you're weightless,\n\n29:02.040 --> 29:04.220\n but generally in free fall.\n\n29:04.220 --> 29:06.580\n So on the parabolic flights, the vomit comet,\n\n29:06.580 --> 29:09.260\n you're in free fall at the end of the parabola.\n\n29:09.260 --> 29:12.380\n And in orbit around the Earth when you're floating,\n\n29:12.380 --> 29:14.340\n you're also in free fall.\n\n29:14.340 --> 29:15.900\n So that's microgravity.\n\n29:15.900 --> 29:17.660\n So affectionately called vomit comet,\n\n29:17.660 --> 29:19.780\n I'm sure there's a reason why it's called affectionately.\n\n29:19.780 --> 29:21.040\n So what's it like?\n\n29:21.040 --> 29:23.560\n What's your first time?\n\n29:23.560 --> 29:27.940\n So both philosophically, spiritually, and biologically,\n\n29:27.940 --> 29:28.860\n what's it like?\n\n29:28.860 --> 29:30.300\n It's profound.\n\n29:30.300 --> 29:35.120\n It is unlike anything else you will experience on Earth\n\n29:35.120 --> 29:38.660\n because it is this true feeling of weightlessness\n\n29:38.660 --> 29:40.000\n with no drag.\n\n29:40.000 --> 29:41.660\n So the closest experience you can think of\n\n29:41.660 --> 29:43.020\n would be floating in a pool,\n\n29:43.020 --> 29:44.860\n but you move slowly when you float in a pool\n\n29:44.860 --> 29:46.540\n and your motion is restricted.\n\n29:46.540 --> 29:49.940\n When you're floating, it's just you and your body flying,\n\n29:49.940 --> 29:51.160\n like in a dream.\n\n29:52.160 --> 29:54.260\n It takes the littlest amount of energy,\n\n29:54.260 --> 29:56.440\n like a finger tap against the wall of the plane\n\n29:56.440 --> 29:58.760\n to shoot all the way across the fuselage.\n\n29:58.760 --> 30:01.100\n And you can move at full speed.\n\n30:01.100 --> 30:02.680\n You can move your arms.\n\n30:02.680 --> 30:03.520\n Exactly.\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:04.340\n So your muscles work.\n\n30:04.340 --> 30:05.180\n There's no resistance.\n\n30:05.180 --> 30:06.800\n There's no resistance.\n\n30:06.800 --> 30:09.940\n They actually tell you to make a memory\n\n30:09.940 --> 30:11.440\n when you're on the plane\n\n30:11.440 --> 30:13.900\n because it's such a fleeting experience for your body\n\n30:13.900 --> 30:14.940\n that even a few days later,\n\n30:14.940 --> 30:17.780\n you've already forgotten exactly what it felt like.\n\n30:17.780 --> 30:20.140\n It's so foreign to the human experience.\n\n30:20.140 --> 30:22.500\n They kind of suggest that you explicitly try\n\n30:22.500 --> 30:24.380\n to really form this into a memory\n\n30:24.380 --> 30:25.700\n and then you can do the replay.\n\n30:25.700 --> 30:26.540\n Is that for training?\n\n30:26.540 --> 30:27.700\n Cognitively freeze it.\n\n30:27.700 --> 30:28.540\n Yeah.\n\n30:28.540 --> 30:29.380\n Cognitively.\n\n30:29.380 --> 30:30.200\n Yeah.\n\n30:30.200 --> 30:31.040\n Save.\n\n30:31.040 --> 30:31.880\n Right.\n\n30:31.880 --> 30:34.980\n When we have Neuralink, we can replay that memory.\n\n30:34.980 --> 30:38.200\n So in terms of how much stress it has on your body,\n\n30:38.200 --> 30:41.180\n is it biologically stressful?\n\n30:41.180 --> 30:43.580\n You do feel a 2G pullout, right?\n\n30:43.580 --> 30:46.460\n So the cost of getting those micro G parabolas\n\n30:46.460 --> 30:48.900\n is you then have a 2G pullout and that's hard.\n\n30:48.900 --> 30:50.180\n You have to train for it.\n\n30:50.180 --> 30:52.620\n If you move your neck too quickly in that 2G pullout,\n\n30:52.620 --> 30:54.780\n you can strain muscles.\n\n30:54.780 --> 30:56.800\n But I wouldn't say that it's actually\n\n30:56.800 --> 31:00.180\n a profound tough thing on the body.\n\n31:00.180 --> 31:02.940\n It's really just an incredibly novel experience.\n\n31:02.940 --> 31:04.500\n And when you're in orbit\n\n31:04.500 --> 31:06.620\n and you're not having to go through the ups and downs\n\n31:06.620 --> 31:07.840\n of the parabolic plane,\n\n31:07.840 --> 31:09.900\n there's a real grace and elegance.\n\n31:09.900 --> 31:12.460\n And you see the astronauts learn to operate\n\n31:12.460 --> 31:14.980\n in this completely new environment.\n\n31:14.980 --> 31:16.380\n What are some interesting differences\n\n31:16.380 --> 31:17.800\n between the parabolic plane\n\n31:17.800 --> 31:20.180\n and when you're actually going up into orbit?\n\n31:20.180 --> 31:22.900\n Is it that with orbit you can look out\n\n31:22.900 --> 31:26.180\n and see that blue little planet of ours?\n\n31:26.180 --> 31:28.800\n You can see the blue marble, the stunning overview effect,\n\n31:28.800 --> 31:30.900\n which is something I hope to see one day.\n\n31:31.940 --> 31:34.180\n What's also really different is if you're in orbit\n\n31:34.180 --> 31:36.060\n for any significant period of time,\n\n31:36.060 --> 31:38.180\n there's gonna be a lot more physiological changes\n\n31:38.180 --> 31:41.500\n to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight\n\n31:41.500 --> 31:42.860\n on the Vomit Comet.\n\n31:42.860 --> 31:44.940\n Everything from your bones, your muscles,\n\n31:44.940 --> 31:47.500\n your eyeballs change shape.\n\n31:47.500 --> 31:49.020\n There's a lot of different things that happen\n\n31:49.020 --> 31:51.120\n for long duration space flight.\n\n31:51.120 --> 31:52.520\n And we still have to, as scientists,\n\n31:52.520 --> 31:54.500\n we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges\n\n31:54.500 --> 31:58.400\n to be able to keep humans thriving in microgravity\n\n31:58.400 --> 32:00.140\n or deep duration space missions.\n\n32:01.000 --> 32:03.580\n Deep duration space missions.\n\n32:03.580 --> 32:05.080\n Okay, let's talk about this.\n\n32:05.080 --> 32:08.220\n I was just gonna ask a bunch of dumb questions.\n\n32:08.220 --> 32:11.660\n So approximately how long does it take to travel to Mars?\n\n32:11.660 --> 32:12.620\n Asking for a friend.\n\n32:12.620 --> 32:14.820\n Asking for a friend, as we all do.\n\n32:14.820 --> 32:17.780\n About three years for a round trip.\n\n32:17.780 --> 32:19.180\n And that's not that it actually takes that long.\n\n32:19.180 --> 32:20.940\n Why the round trip, is that?\n\n32:20.940 --> 32:23.780\n Well, you're just asking about the one way trip.\n\n32:23.780 --> 32:25.020\n Got it, got it, got it.\n\n32:25.020 --> 32:25.860\n It's okay, cool.\n\n32:25.860 --> 32:29.460\n So for just like literally flying to Mars in a round,\n\n32:29.460 --> 32:30.740\n it takes three years.\n\n32:30.740 --> 32:32.540\n There's some interstitial time there\n\n32:32.540 --> 32:35.460\n because you really can only go between Earth and Mars\n\n32:35.460 --> 32:37.540\n at certain points in their orbits\n\n32:37.540 --> 32:39.420\n where it's favorable to make that journey.\n\n32:39.420 --> 32:40.860\n And so part of that three years\n\n32:40.860 --> 32:42.900\n is you take the journey to Mars,\n\n32:42.900 --> 32:45.000\n a few months, six to nine months.\n\n32:45.000 --> 32:46.400\n You're there for a period of time\n\n32:46.400 --> 32:49.860\n until the orbits find a favorable alignment again.\n\n32:49.860 --> 32:51.900\n And then you come back another six to nine months.\n\n32:51.900 --> 32:54.140\n So one way travel, six to nine months.\n\n32:54.140 --> 32:56.420\n They hang out there on vacation and come back.\n\n32:56.420 --> 32:57.260\n Forced vacation.\n\n32:57.260 --> 32:58.080\n Forced vacation.\n\n32:58.080 --> 32:58.920\n You come back.\n\n32:58.920 --> 33:00.940\n Well, me who loves working all the time,\n\n33:00.940 --> 33:03.260\n all vacation is forced vacation.\n\n33:03.260 --> 33:04.660\n All right.\n\n33:04.660 --> 33:07.780\n So okay, so that gives us a sense of duration.\n\n33:07.780 --> 33:10.260\n And we can maybe also talk about longer\n\n33:10.260 --> 33:13.580\n and longer and longer duration as well.\n\n33:13.580 --> 33:18.580\n What are the hardest aspects of living in space\n\n33:18.700 --> 33:23.320\n for many days, for let's say 100 days, 200 days?\n\n33:23.320 --> 33:25.900\n Maybe there's a threshold when it gets really tough.\n\n33:25.900 --> 33:29.780\n What are some stupid little things or big things\n\n33:29.780 --> 33:32.340\n that are very difficult for human beings to go through?\n\n33:32.340 --> 33:33.860\n It's one big thing and one little thing.\n\n33:33.860 --> 33:35.460\n And there are these two classic problems\n\n33:35.460 --> 33:37.260\n that we're trying to solve in the space industry.\n\n33:37.260 --> 33:38.820\n One is radiation.\n\n33:38.820 --> 33:40.940\n It's not as much of a problem for us right now\n\n33:40.940 --> 33:42.280\n on the International Space Station\n\n33:42.280 --> 33:44.100\n because we're still protected\n\n33:44.100 --> 33:46.140\n by part of Earth's magnetosphere.\n\n33:46.140 --> 33:47.980\n But as soon as you get farther out into space\n\n33:47.980 --> 33:49.340\n and you don't have that protection\n\n33:49.340 --> 33:52.700\n once you leave the Van Allen belt area of the Earth\n\n33:52.700 --> 33:55.380\n and the cocoon around the Earth,\n\n33:55.380 --> 33:57.940\n we have really serious concerns about radiation\n\n33:57.940 --> 33:59.940\n and the effect on human health longterm.\n\n33:59.940 --> 34:01.360\n That's the big one.\n\n34:01.360 --> 34:02.960\n The small one, and I say it's small\n\n34:02.960 --> 34:04.340\n because it seems mundane,\n\n34:04.340 --> 34:06.020\n but it actually is really big in its own way,\n\n34:06.020 --> 34:09.100\n is mental health and how to keep people happy and balanced.\n\n34:09.100 --> 34:10.820\n And you were alluding to some of the psychological\n\n34:10.820 --> 34:13.980\n challenges of having humans together on missions\n\n34:13.980 --> 34:16.180\n and especially as we try to scale the number of humans\n\n34:16.180 --> 34:18.180\n in orbit or in space.\n\n34:18.180 --> 34:20.520\n So that's another big challenge is how to keep people happy\n\n34:20.520 --> 34:22.860\n and balanced and cooperating.\n\n34:24.140 --> 34:25.940\n That's not an issue on Earth at all.\n\n34:25.940 --> 34:27.220\n At all.\n\n34:27.220 --> 34:29.460\n Okay, so we'll talk about each of those\n\n34:29.460 --> 34:31.140\n in a bit more detail,\n\n34:31.140 --> 34:34.460\n but let me continue on the chain of dumb questions.\n\n34:34.460 --> 34:35.700\n What about food?\n\n34:35.700 --> 34:38.660\n What's a good source for food in space?\n\n34:38.660 --> 34:42.700\n And what are some sort of standard go to meals, menus?\n\n34:42.700 --> 34:46.060\n Right now your go to menu is gonna be mostly freeze dried.\n\n34:46.060 --> 34:50.380\n Every so often NASA will arrange for a fun stunt\n\n34:50.380 --> 34:51.900\n or fresh food to get up to station.\n\n34:51.900 --> 34:54.540\n So they did bake DoubleTree cookies with Hilton\n\n34:54.540 --> 34:55.800\n a couple of years ago, as I recall,\n\n34:55.800 --> 34:57.820\n I think sometime before the pandemic.\n\n34:57.820 --> 35:00.140\n But there's work actually in our lab at MIT,\n\n35:00.140 --> 35:02.140\n Maggie Koblans, one of my staff researchers\n\n35:02.140 --> 35:04.580\n is looking at the future of fermentation.\n\n35:04.580 --> 35:06.120\n Everybody loves beer, right?\n\n35:06.120 --> 35:08.700\n Beer and wine and kimchi and miso,\n\n35:08.700 --> 35:11.880\n these foods that have just been really important\n\n35:11.880 --> 35:15.100\n to human cultures for eons because we love the umami\n\n35:15.100 --> 35:16.540\n and the better flavor in them.\n\n35:16.540 --> 35:18.420\n But it turns out they also have a good shelf life\n\n35:18.420 --> 35:19.740\n if done properly.\n\n35:19.740 --> 35:22.460\n And they also have a additional health benefit\n\n35:22.460 --> 35:25.660\n for the microbiome, for probiotics and prebiotics.\n\n35:25.660 --> 35:28.180\n So we're trying to work with NASA and convince them\n\n35:28.180 --> 35:30.980\n to be more open minded to fermented food\n\n35:30.980 --> 35:33.120\n for long duration deep space missions.\n\n35:33.120 --> 35:35.180\n That we think is one of the future elements\n\n35:35.180 --> 35:38.580\n in addition to in situ growing your own food.\n\n35:38.580 --> 35:41.420\n Okay, this is essential for the space party\n\n35:41.420 --> 35:43.300\n is the space beer.\n\n35:43.300 --> 35:45.780\n Yes, it's the fermented product, yes.\n\n35:45.780 --> 35:46.740\n Okay, cool.\n\n35:46.740 --> 35:49.700\n In terms of water, what's a good source of drinkable water?\n\n35:49.700 --> 35:50.660\n Like where do you get water?\n\n35:50.660 --> 35:52.900\n Do you have to always bring it on board with you?\n\n35:52.900 --> 35:56.700\n And is there a compressed efficient way of storing it?\n\n35:56.700 --> 35:58.860\n So to steal a line from Charlie Bolden,\n\n35:58.860 --> 36:01.420\n who's the former administrator of NASA,\n\n36:01.420 --> 36:04.640\n this morning's fresh water is yesterday's coffee.\n\n36:04.640 --> 36:06.420\n So if you think about what that means,\n\n36:06.420 --> 36:08.100\n you drank the coffee yesterday.\n\n36:08.100 --> 36:10.780\n Right, as it travels, it goes fully through the body.\n\n36:10.780 --> 36:13.100\n Fully through the body as the recycling system.\n\n36:13.100 --> 36:15.420\n And then you drink what you peed out\n\n36:15.420 --> 36:20.420\n as clarified, refined fresh water the next day.\n\n36:20.420 --> 36:22.340\n That is one source of water.\n\n36:22.340 --> 36:24.460\n Another source of water in the near neighborhood\n\n36:24.460 --> 36:26.180\n of our solar system would be on the moon.\n\n36:26.180 --> 36:29.100\n So water ice deposits, there's also water on Mars.\n\n36:29.100 --> 36:31.740\n This is one of the big things that's bringing people\n\n36:31.740 --> 36:34.260\n to want to develop infrastructure on the moon\n\n36:34.260 --> 36:36.780\n is once you've gotten out of the gravity well of Earth,\n\n36:36.780 --> 36:39.340\n if you can find water on the moon and refine it,\n\n36:39.340 --> 36:40.900\n you can either make it into propellant\n\n36:40.900 --> 36:43.180\n or drinkable water for humans.\n\n36:43.180 --> 36:46.100\n And so that's really valuable as a potential gateway\n\n36:46.100 --> 36:47.660\n out into the rest of the solar system\n\n36:47.660 --> 36:48.860\n to be able to get propellant\n\n36:48.860 --> 36:51.100\n without always having to ship it up from Earth.\n\n36:52.300 --> 36:55.220\n So how much water is there on Mars?\n\n36:55.220 --> 36:56.060\n That's a great question.\n\n36:56.060 --> 36:56.900\n I do not know.\n\n36:56.900 --> 36:57.740\n We don't know this yet, right?\n\n36:57.740 --> 36:58.900\n I know there's water at the caps.\n\n36:58.900 --> 37:03.340\n I suspect NASA from all of the satellite studies\n\n37:03.340 --> 37:05.780\n that they've done at Mars have a decent idea\n\n37:05.780 --> 37:07.620\n of what the water deposits look like,\n\n37:07.620 --> 37:08.660\n but I don't know to what degree\n\n37:08.660 --> 37:10.540\n they have characterized those.\n\n37:10.540 --> 37:13.100\n I really hope there's life or traces\n\n37:13.100 --> 37:15.780\n of previous life on Mars.\n\n37:15.780 --> 37:17.660\n This is a special spot in my heart\n\n37:17.660 --> 37:20.020\n because I got to work on SHERLOC,\n\n37:20.020 --> 37:22.260\n which is the astrobiology experiment\n\n37:22.260 --> 37:23.660\n that's on Mars right now,\n\n37:23.660 --> 37:25.540\n searching for what they would say\n\n37:25.540 --> 37:30.060\n in a very cautious way is signs of past habitability.\n\n37:30.060 --> 37:32.260\n They wanna be careful not to get people overly excited\n\n37:32.260 --> 37:34.180\n and say we're searching for signs of life.\n\n37:34.180 --> 37:37.460\n They're searching to see if there would have been organics\n\n37:37.460 --> 37:39.820\n on the surface of Mars or water in certain areas\n\n37:39.820 --> 37:42.660\n that would have allowed for life to flourish.\n\n37:42.660 --> 37:44.620\n And I really love this prospect.\n\n37:44.620 --> 37:46.500\n I do think within our lifetimes\n\n37:46.500 --> 37:49.420\n we'll get a better answer about finding life\n\n37:49.420 --> 37:51.420\n in our solar system if it's there.\n\n37:51.420 --> 37:54.980\n If not on Mars, maybe Europa, one of the icy worlds.\n\n37:54.980 --> 37:58.300\n So you like astrobiology.\n\n37:58.300 --> 37:59.140\n I do.\n\n37:59.140 --> 38:02.620\n This is part of the, it's not just about human biology.\n\n38:02.620 --> 38:05.740\n It's also other extraterrestrial alien biology.\n\n38:05.740 --> 38:07.540\n Search for life in the universe.\n\n38:07.540 --> 38:08.380\n Okay.\n\n38:08.380 --> 38:09.580\n Does that scare you or excite you?\n\n38:09.580 --> 38:11.220\n It excites me, profoundly excites me.\n\n38:11.220 --> 38:13.580\n That there's other alien civilizations\n\n38:13.580 --> 38:16.100\n potentially very different than our own?\n\n38:16.100 --> 38:18.020\n I think there's gotta be some humility there.\n\n38:18.020 --> 38:19.300\n And certainly from science fiction\n\n38:19.300 --> 38:22.660\n we have plenty of reasons to fear that outcome as well.\n\n38:22.660 --> 38:24.020\n But I do think as a scientist\n\n38:24.020 --> 38:26.660\n it would be profoundly exciting if we were to find life\n\n38:26.660 --> 38:29.540\n especially in the near neighborhood of our solar system.\n\n38:29.540 --> 38:32.580\n Right now we would expect it to be most likely microbial life\n\n38:32.580 --> 38:34.860\n but we have a real serious challenge in astrobiology\n\n38:34.860 --> 38:37.860\n which is it may not even be carbon based life.\n\n38:37.860 --> 38:39.180\n And all of our detectors,\n\n38:39.180 --> 38:42.100\n we only know to look for DNA or RNA.\n\n38:42.100 --> 38:43.820\n How would you even build a detector\n\n38:43.820 --> 38:47.260\n to look for silicon based life\n\n38:47.260 --> 38:49.140\n or different molecules than what we know\n\n38:49.140 --> 38:51.380\n to be the fundamental molecules for life?\n\n38:51.380 --> 38:53.380\n And then you mentioned offline Sarah Walker.\n\n38:53.380 --> 38:56.380\n I mean she, her, the question that she's obsessed with\n\n38:56.380 --> 38:58.300\n is even just defining life.\n\n38:58.300 --> 38:59.460\n What is life?\n\n38:59.460 --> 39:02.020\n To look outside the carbon base.\n\n39:02.020 --> 39:04.380\n I mean to look outside of basically anything\n\n39:04.380 --> 39:06.740\n we can even imagine chemically.\n\n39:06.740 --> 39:08.300\n To look outside of any kind of notions\n\n39:08.300 --> 39:10.260\n that we think of as biology.\n\n39:10.260 --> 39:11.740\n Yeah, it's really weird.\n\n39:11.740 --> 39:14.420\n So you now get into this land of like complexity\n\n39:14.420 --> 39:19.420\n of a measuring of like how many assembly steps\n\n39:20.540 --> 39:22.580\n it takes to build that thing.\n\n39:22.580 --> 39:23.420\n Right.\n\n39:23.420 --> 39:27.660\n And maybe dynamic movement or some maintenance\n\n39:27.660 --> 39:29.700\n of some kind of membrane structures.\n\n39:29.700 --> 39:33.500\n We don't even know like which properties life should have.\n\n39:33.500 --> 39:34.340\n Right.\n\n39:34.340 --> 39:36.220\n Whether it should be able to reproduce\n\n39:36.220 --> 39:39.180\n and all those kinds of things or pass information,\n\n39:39.180 --> 39:41.180\n genetic type of information.\n\n39:41.180 --> 39:42.420\n We don't know.\n\n39:42.420 --> 39:45.140\n And it's like, it's so humbling.\n\n39:45.140 --> 39:47.660\n I mean I tend to believe that there could be\n\n39:48.540 --> 39:51.060\n something like alien life here on Earth\n\n39:51.060 --> 39:54.620\n and we're just too human, biology obsessed\n\n39:54.620 --> 39:55.980\n to even recognize it.\n\n39:55.980 --> 39:57.940\n The shadow biosphere, I remember you and Sarah\n\n39:57.940 --> 39:58.940\n were talking about.\n\n39:58.940 --> 40:02.220\n I mean that's like, speaking of beer,\n\n40:02.220 --> 40:04.380\n I mean that's something I wanted to make sure\n\n40:04.380 --> 40:07.240\n in all of science to shake ourselves out of like,\n\n40:07.240 --> 40:10.140\n remind ourselves constantly how little we know.\n\n40:10.140 --> 40:13.100\n Because it might be right in front of our nose.\n\n40:13.100 --> 40:15.900\n Like I wouldn't be surprised if like trees\n\n40:15.900 --> 40:18.860\n are like orders of magnitude more intelligent than humans.\n\n40:18.860 --> 40:21.300\n They're just operating at a much slower scale\n\n40:21.300 --> 40:23.820\n and they're like talking shit about us the whole time.\n\n40:23.820 --> 40:26.580\n Like about silly humans that take everything seriously\n\n40:26.580 --> 40:28.640\n and we start all kinds of nuclear wars\n\n40:28.640 --> 40:31.900\n and we quarrel and we tweet about it and then,\n\n40:31.900 --> 40:35.180\n but the trees are always there just watching us silly humans.\n\n40:35.180 --> 40:37.020\n Like the Ents in Lord of the Rings.\n\n40:37.020 --> 40:37.860\n Exactly.\n\n40:37.860 --> 40:40.940\n So I mean, I don't know, I mean, obviously I'm joking\n\n40:40.940 --> 40:43.220\n on that one, but there could be stuff like that.\n\n40:44.140 --> 40:46.700\n Well, let me ask you the Drake equation,\n\n40:46.700 --> 40:51.060\n the big question, how many, like obviously nobody knows,\n\n40:51.060 --> 40:54.180\n but what's your gut, what's your hope as a scientist,\n\n40:54.180 --> 40:57.140\n as a human, how many alien civilizations are out there?\n\n40:58.540 --> 41:01.260\n As a ex physicist, I'm now much more\n\n41:01.260 --> 41:03.500\n on the aerospace engineering side for space architecture,\n\n41:03.500 --> 41:08.500\n but as an ex physicist, I hope it is prolific.\n\n41:08.660 --> 41:10.660\n I think the challenge is if it's as prolific\n\n41:10.660 --> 41:12.900\n as we would hope, if there are many, many, many\n\n41:12.900 --> 41:16.940\n civilizations, then the question is, where are they?\n\n41:16.940 --> 41:18.740\n Why haven't we heard from them?\n\n41:18.740 --> 41:21.820\n And the Fermi paradox, is there some great filter\n\n41:21.820 --> 41:25.540\n that life only gets to some level of sophistication\n\n41:25.540 --> 41:29.220\n and then kills itself off through war or through famine\n\n41:29.220 --> 41:30.860\n or through different challenges that filter\n\n41:30.860 --> 41:33.820\n that society out of existence?\n\n41:33.820 --> 41:35.140\n And it would be an interesting question to try\n\n41:35.140 --> 41:38.100\n to understand if the universe was teeming with life,\n\n41:38.100 --> 41:41.080\n why haven't we found it or heard from it yet,\n\n41:41.080 --> 41:41.920\n to our knowledge?\n\n41:41.920 --> 41:44.900\n Yeah, I personally believe that it's teeming with life,\n\n41:44.900 --> 41:46.920\n and you're right, I think that's a really useful,\n\n41:46.920 --> 41:49.460\n productive engineering scientific question\n\n41:49.460 --> 41:53.540\n of what kind of great filter can just be destroying\n\n41:53.540 --> 41:57.380\n all of that life or preventing it from just constantly\n\n41:57.380 --> 42:01.540\n talking to us, silly descendants of apes.\n\n42:01.540 --> 42:05.380\n That's a really nice question, like what are the ways\n\n42:05.380 --> 42:07.720\n civilizations can destroy themselves?\n\n42:09.020 --> 42:10.660\n There's too many, sadly.\n\n42:10.660 --> 42:13.620\n Well, I don't think we've come up with most of them yet.\n\n42:13.620 --> 42:15.580\n That's also probably true.\n\n42:15.580 --> 42:18.920\n That's the thing, it's, I mean, and if you look\n\n42:18.920 --> 42:21.860\n at nuclear war, some of it is physics,\n\n42:21.860 --> 42:26.180\n but some of it is game theory, it's human nature,\n\n42:26.180 --> 42:29.260\n it's how societies built themselves, how they interact,\n\n42:29.260 --> 42:32.540\n how we create and resolve conflict,\n\n42:32.540 --> 42:34.640\n and it gets back to the human question\n\n42:34.640 --> 42:37.120\n on when you're doing long term space travel,\n\n42:37.120 --> 42:40.320\n how do you maintain this dynamical system\n\n42:40.320 --> 42:45.320\n of flawed, irrational humans such that it persists\n\n42:46.580 --> 42:50.140\n throughout time, and not just maintain the biological body,\n\n42:50.140 --> 42:52.660\n but get people from not murdering each other,\n\n42:52.660 --> 42:56.700\n like like each other sufficiently to where you kinda\n\n42:56.700 --> 43:01.700\n fit well, but I think if songs or poetry or books\n\n43:01.900 --> 43:04.700\n taught me anything, if you like each other a little too much,\n\n43:05.800 --> 43:07.860\n I mean, the problems arise, because then there's always\n\n43:07.860 --> 43:10.180\n a third person who also likes, and then there's the drama,\n\n43:10.180 --> 43:12.820\n it's like, I can't believe you did that last night,\n\n43:12.820 --> 43:14.780\n whatever, so, and then there's beer.\n\n43:14.780 --> 43:17.180\n Gets complicated quickly. Gets complicated quickly.\n\n43:17.180 --> 43:20.220\n Okay, anyway, back to the dumb questions,\n\n43:20.220 --> 43:22.900\n because you answered this, there's an interview\n\n43:22.900 --> 43:24.500\n where you answer a bunch of cool little questions\n\n43:24.500 --> 43:28.300\n from young students and so on, about like space.\n\n43:29.540 --> 43:32.340\n One of them was playing music in space.\n\n43:32.340 --> 43:33.220\n Yeah.\n\n43:33.220 --> 43:37.060\n And you mentioned something about what kind of instruments\n\n43:37.060 --> 43:39.460\n you could use to play music in space.\n\n43:39.460 --> 43:43.120\n Could you mention about like the Spotify work in space,\n\n43:43.120 --> 43:45.060\n and if I wanted to do a live performance,\n\n43:45.060 --> 43:47.780\n what kind of instruments would I need?\n\n43:47.780 --> 43:50.300\n Yeah, I mean, you referenced culture before,\n\n43:50.300 --> 43:51.960\n and I think this is one of the most exciting things\n\n43:51.960 --> 43:55.380\n that we have at our fingertips, which is to define\n\n43:55.380 --> 43:57.780\n a new culture for space exploration.\n\n43:57.780 --> 44:01.620\n We don't just have to import cultural artifacts from Earth\n\n44:01.620 --> 44:03.460\n to make life worth living in space,\n\n44:03.460 --> 44:05.140\n and this musical instrument that you referenced\n\n44:05.140 --> 44:08.180\n was a design of an object that could only be performed\n\n44:08.180 --> 44:09.460\n in microgravity.\n\n44:09.460 --> 44:10.300\n Oh, cool.\n\n44:10.300 --> 44:13.140\n So it doesn't sound the same way when it's,\n\n44:13.140 --> 44:15.140\n it's a percussive instrument when it's rattled\n\n44:15.140 --> 44:17.500\n or moved in a gravity environment, it is unique.\n\n44:17.500 --> 44:18.340\n Can we look it up?\n\n44:18.340 --> 44:19.500\n It's called the Telematron.\n\n44:19.500 --> 44:20.340\n Yeah, it's created by.\n\n44:20.340 --> 44:21.900\n Of course it's called the Telematron.\n\n44:21.900 --> 44:22.720\n Telematron.\n\n44:22.720 --> 44:23.560\n That is so awesome.\n\n44:23.560 --> 44:25.780\n Created by Sands Fish and Nicole Boulier,\n\n44:25.780 --> 44:28.540\n two amazing graduate students and staff researchers\n\n44:28.540 --> 44:29.460\n on my team.\n\n44:29.460 --> 44:30.300\n What does it look like?\n\n44:30.300 --> 44:33.300\n It looks steampunk, actually.\n\n44:33.300 --> 44:34.140\n That's awesome.\n\n44:34.140 --> 44:35.100\n Yeah, it's a pretty cool design.\n\n44:35.100 --> 44:37.300\n It looks like it's a geometric solid\n\n44:37.300 --> 44:39.860\n that has these interesting artifacts on the inside,\n\n44:39.860 --> 44:41.260\n and it has a lot of sensors, actually,\n\n44:41.260 --> 44:42.220\n additionally on the inside,\n\n44:42.220 --> 44:44.980\n like IMU's inertial measurement sensors\n\n44:44.980 --> 44:47.780\n that allow it to detect when it's floating\n\n44:47.780 --> 44:49.140\n and when it's not floating,\n\n44:49.140 --> 44:52.500\n and provides this really kind of ethereal,\n\n44:52.500 --> 44:53.580\n they later sonify it.\n\n44:53.580 --> 44:56.220\n So they use electronic music to turn it into a symphony\n\n44:56.220 --> 44:57.620\n or turn it into a piece.\n\n44:57.620 --> 44:59.580\n And yeah, this is the object, the Telematron.\n\n44:59.580 --> 45:01.380\n How does the human interact with it?\n\n45:01.380 --> 45:02.220\n By tossing it.\n\n45:02.220 --> 45:04.020\n So it's an interactive musical instrument.\n\n45:04.020 --> 45:06.420\n It actually requires another partner.\n\n45:06.420 --> 45:09.420\n So the idea was that it's something like a dance\n\n45:09.420 --> 45:12.020\n or just like something like a choreography in space.\n\n45:12.020 --> 45:12.860\n Got it.\n\n45:12.860 --> 45:15.820\n Speaking of which, you also talked about sports,\n\n45:15.820 --> 45:18.340\n and like ball sports, like playing soccer.\n\n45:18.340 --> 45:20.220\n So you mentioned that,\n\n45:20.220 --> 45:22.940\n so your muscles can move at full speed,\n\n45:23.780 --> 45:26.460\n and then if you push off the wall lightly,\n\n45:26.460 --> 45:28.660\n you fly across, zoom across.\n\n45:28.660 --> 45:31.340\n So how does the physics of that work?\n\n45:31.340 --> 45:34.420\n Can you still play soccer, for example, in space?\n\n45:34.420 --> 45:37.220\n You can, but one of the most intuitive things\n\n45:37.220 --> 45:39.140\n that we all learn as babies, right,\n\n45:39.140 --> 45:40.620\n is whenever you throw something,\n\n45:40.620 --> 45:41.940\n if I was gonna toss something to you,\n\n45:41.940 --> 45:42.980\n I'd toss it up,\n\n45:42.980 --> 45:44.660\n because I know that it has to compensate\n\n45:44.660 --> 45:47.620\n for the fact that that Keplerian arc is gonna draw it down,\n\n45:47.620 --> 45:50.860\n the equations of motion are gonna draw it down.\n\n45:50.860 --> 45:51.900\n I would, in space,\n\n45:51.900 --> 45:54.420\n I would just shoot something directly towards you,\n\n45:54.420 --> 45:56.260\n so like straight in line of sight.\n\n45:56.260 --> 45:57.380\n And so that would be very different\n\n45:57.380 --> 45:58.580\n for any type of ball sport,\n\n45:58.580 --> 46:00.420\n is to retrain your human mind\n\n46:00.420 --> 46:03.380\n to have that as your intuitive arc of motion\n\n46:03.380 --> 46:04.300\n or lack of arc.\n\n46:04.300 --> 46:05.460\n From your experience,\n\n46:05.460 --> 46:07.180\n from understanding how astronauts\n\n46:07.180 --> 46:08.460\n get adjusted to this stuff,\n\n46:08.460 --> 46:10.340\n how long does it take to adjust to the physics\n\n46:10.340 --> 46:12.980\n of this world, this other world?\n\n46:12.980 --> 46:15.420\n So even after one or two parabolic flights,\n\n46:15.420 --> 46:18.620\n you can gain a certain facility\n\n46:18.620 --> 46:20.660\n with moving in that environment.\n\n46:20.660 --> 46:22.180\n I think most astronauts would say\n\n46:22.180 --> 46:23.820\n maybe several days on station\n\n46:23.820 --> 46:25.020\n or a week on station,\n\n46:25.020 --> 46:26.740\n and their brain flips.\n\n46:26.740 --> 46:28.940\n It's amazing the plasticity of the human brain\n\n46:28.940 --> 46:31.140\n and how quickly they are able to adapt.\n\n46:31.140 --> 46:32.060\n And so pretty quickly,\n\n46:32.060 --> 46:36.100\n they become creatures of this new environment.\n\n46:36.100 --> 46:36.940\n Okay, so that's cool.\n\n46:36.940 --> 46:38.980\n It's creating a little bit of an experience.\n\n46:38.980 --> 46:42.420\n What about if you go for more than 100 days\n\n46:42.420 --> 46:46.100\n for one year, for two years, for three years?\n\n46:46.100 --> 46:49.100\n What challenges start to emerge in that case?\n\n46:49.100 --> 46:50.940\n So Scott Kelly wrote this amazing book\n\n46:50.940 --> 46:52.580\n after he spent a year in space,\n\n46:52.580 --> 46:53.460\n and he's a twin.\n\n46:53.460 --> 46:54.780\n It's absolutely fantastic\n\n46:54.780 --> 46:57.140\n that NASA got to do a twin study.\n\n46:57.140 --> 46:58.540\n It's perfect.\n\n46:58.540 --> 47:00.740\n So he wrote a lot about his experience\n\n47:00.740 --> 47:02.980\n on the health side of what changed,\n\n47:02.980 --> 47:06.900\n things like bone density, muscle atrophy,\n\n47:06.900 --> 47:08.140\n eyesight changing\n\n47:08.140 --> 47:10.060\n because the shape of your eyeball changes,\n\n47:10.060 --> 47:11.180\n which changes your lens,\n\n47:11.180 --> 47:12.900\n which changes how you see.\n\n47:12.900 --> 47:14.620\n If we're then thinking about the challenges\n\n47:14.620 --> 47:16.500\n between a year and three years,\n\n47:16.500 --> 47:18.500\n especially if we're doing that three year trip to Mars\n\n47:18.500 --> 47:20.340\n for your friend who asked earlier,\n\n47:20.340 --> 47:23.940\n then you have to think about nutrition.\n\n47:23.940 --> 47:25.620\n And so how are you keeping\n\n47:25.620 --> 47:28.060\n all of these different needs for your body alive?\n\n47:28.060 --> 47:30.620\n How are you protecting astronauts against radiation?\n\n47:30.620 --> 47:33.100\n Either having some type of a shell on the spacecraft,\n\n47:33.100 --> 47:35.540\n which is expensive because it's heavy.\n\n47:35.540 --> 47:36.420\n If it's something like lead,\n\n47:36.420 --> 47:37.980\n a really effective radiation shell,\n\n47:37.980 --> 47:39.660\n it's gonna be a lot of mass.\n\n47:39.660 --> 47:42.060\n Or is there a pill that could be taken\n\n47:42.060 --> 47:46.500\n to try to make you less in danger\n\n47:46.500 --> 47:49.300\n of some of the radiation effects?\n\n47:49.300 --> 47:51.060\n A lot of this has not yet been answered,\n\n47:51.060 --> 47:53.420\n but radiation is a really significant challenge\n\n47:53.420 --> 47:55.540\n for that three year journey.\n\n47:55.540 --> 47:57.460\n And what are the negative effects of radiation\n\n47:57.460 --> 47:59.140\n on the human body out in space?\n\n47:59.140 --> 48:03.300\n A higher likelihood to develop cancer at a younger age.\n\n48:03.300 --> 48:05.260\n So you'd probably be able to get there and get back,\n\n48:05.260 --> 48:08.100\n but you'd find yourself in the same way\n\n48:08.100 --> 48:10.740\n of if you were exposed to significant radiation on Earth,\n\n48:10.740 --> 48:13.460\n you'd find significant bad health effects as you age.\n\n48:14.380 --> 48:16.980\n What do you think about like decades?\n\n48:16.980 --> 48:19.100\n Do you think about decades?\n\n48:19.100 --> 48:21.220\n Or is this like an entire?\n\n48:21.220 --> 48:23.980\n I think about centuries for MySpace.\n\n48:23.980 --> 48:25.820\n But yeah, for decades,\n\n48:25.820 --> 48:28.340\n I think as soon as we get past the three year mark,\n\n48:28.340 --> 48:29.580\n we'll absolutely want,\n\n48:29.580 --> 48:31.100\n somewhere between three years and a decade,\n\n48:31.100 --> 48:33.620\n we'll want artificial gravity.\n\n48:33.620 --> 48:35.300\n And we know how to do that, actually.\n\n48:35.300 --> 48:37.380\n The engineering questions still need to be tweaked\n\n48:37.380 --> 48:38.460\n for how we'd really implement it,\n\n48:38.460 --> 48:39.700\n but the science is there to know\n\n48:39.700 --> 48:44.100\n how we would spin habitats in orbit and generate that force.\n\n48:44.100 --> 48:46.380\n So even if the entire habitat's not spinning,\n\n48:46.380 --> 48:49.060\n you at least have a treadmill part of the space station\n\n48:49.060 --> 48:50.180\n that is spinning,\n\n48:50.180 --> 48:52.340\n and you can spend some fraction of your day\n\n48:52.340 --> 48:56.780\n in a near to 1G environment and keep your body healthy.\n\n48:56.780 --> 48:58.420\n Wait, literally from just spinning?\n\n48:58.420 --> 49:00.140\n From spinning, yes, centripetal force.\n\n49:00.140 --> 49:01.500\n That's fascinating. So you generate this force.\n\n49:01.500 --> 49:03.500\n If you've ever been in those carnival rides,\n\n49:03.500 --> 49:06.060\n the gravitrons that spin you up around the side,\n\n49:06.060 --> 49:07.300\n that's the concept.\n\n49:07.300 --> 49:08.900\n And this is actually one of the reasons\n\n49:08.900 --> 49:12.140\n why we are spinning out a new company\n\n49:12.140 --> 49:13.860\n from my MIT lab. Spinning out, ha.\n\n49:13.860 --> 49:14.700\n Spinning out, ha.\n\n49:14.700 --> 49:18.020\n That was accidental, but well noted space pun.\n\n49:18.020 --> 49:20.660\n It's like impossible to avoid. Dad jokes, all right.\n\n49:20.660 --> 49:23.820\n But yeah, we're spinning out a new company\n\n49:23.820 --> 49:27.820\n to look at next generation space architecture,\n\n49:27.820 --> 49:30.540\n and how do we actually scale humanity's access to space?\n\n49:30.540 --> 49:32.540\n And one of the areas that we wanna look at\n\n49:32.540 --> 49:34.060\n is artificial gravity.\n\n49:34.060 --> 49:34.940\n Is there a name yet?\n\n49:34.940 --> 49:36.540\n Yep, there's a name. We are brand new.\n\n49:36.540 --> 49:38.780\n We are just exiting stealth mode.\n\n49:38.780 --> 49:40.940\n So your podcast listeners will literally be among\n\n49:40.940 --> 49:42.540\n some of the first to hear about it.\n\n49:42.540 --> 49:45.220\n It's called Aurelia Institute.\n\n49:45.220 --> 49:48.260\n Aurelia is an old English word for chrysalis.\n\n49:48.260 --> 49:51.940\n And the idea with this is that we, humanity collectively,\n\n49:51.940 --> 49:55.620\n are at this next stage of our metamorphosis,\n\n49:55.620 --> 49:58.660\n like a chrysalis, into a spacefaring species.\n\n49:58.660 --> 50:00.860\n And so we felt that this was a good time,\n\n50:00.860 --> 50:04.340\n a necessary time, to think about\n\n50:04.340 --> 50:06.100\n next generation space architecture,\n\n50:06.100 --> 50:08.100\n but also Starfleet Academy,\n\n50:08.100 --> 50:10.180\n if you know that reference from Star Trek.\n\n50:12.300 --> 50:17.220\n Yes, so let me ask a silly sounding, ridiculous sounding,\n\n50:17.220 --> 50:19.900\n but probably extremely important question.\n\n50:19.900 --> 50:23.220\n Sex and space, including intercourse, conception,\n\n50:23.220 --> 50:27.820\n procreation, birth, like being a parent,\n\n50:27.820 --> 50:29.180\n like raising the baby.\n\n50:29.180 --> 50:33.420\n So basically from birth, well, from the before birth part,\n\n50:33.420 --> 50:34.780\n like the birds and the bees and stuff,\n\n50:34.780 --> 50:37.020\n and then the whole thing.\n\n50:37.020 --> 50:38.500\n How complicated is that?\n\n50:38.500 --> 50:41.020\n I remember looking at the, thank you.\n\n50:43.300 --> 50:46.020\n I remember looking at this exact Wikipedia page actually,\n\n50:46.020 --> 50:50.180\n and I remember being, the Wikipedia page is sex and space,\n\n50:50.180 --> 50:52.660\n and fascinating how difficult of an engineering problem\n\n50:52.660 --> 50:53.740\n the whole thing is.\n\n50:53.740 --> 50:55.340\n Is that something you think about too,\n\n50:55.340 --> 50:58.900\n how to have generations of humans?\n\n50:58.900 --> 51:03.100\n Self, self replicating organizations.\n\n51:03.100 --> 51:04.740\n Yeah, societies essentially.\n\n51:04.740 --> 51:05.820\n I mean, I guess with micro,\n\n51:05.820 --> 51:07.500\n like if you solve the gravity problem,\n\n51:07.500 --> 51:09.020\n you solve a lot of these problems.\n\n51:09.020 --> 51:09.980\n That's the hope, yeah.\n\n51:09.980 --> 51:12.140\n It's like the central challenge of microgravity\n\n51:12.140 --> 51:13.660\n to human reproduction.\n\n51:13.660 --> 51:16.660\n But we do host a workshop every year at Beyond the Cradle,\n\n51:16.660 --> 51:18.820\n which is the space event that we run at MIT.\n\n51:18.820 --> 51:21.580\n And we always do one on pregnancy in space,\n\n51:21.580 --> 51:24.420\n or motherhood, or raising children in space,\n\n51:24.420 --> 51:26.740\n because there are huge questions.\n\n51:26.740 --> 51:29.060\n There've been a few mammal studies\n\n51:29.060 --> 51:31.060\n that have looked at reproduction in space,\n\n51:31.060 --> 51:32.500\n but there are still really major questions\n\n51:32.500 --> 51:33.820\n about how does it work?\n\n51:33.820 --> 51:36.100\n How does the fetus evolve in microgravity\n\n51:36.100 --> 51:37.460\n if you were pregnant in space?\n\n51:37.460 --> 51:39.540\n And I think the near term answer is just gonna be,\n\n51:39.540 --> 51:43.940\n we need to be able to give humans a 1G environment\n\n51:43.940 --> 51:45.220\n for that phase of our development.\n\n51:45.220 --> 51:49.220\n Yeah, so there's some studies on mice in microgravity.\n\n51:49.220 --> 51:51.180\n And it's interesting, I think the mice,\n\n51:51.180 --> 51:53.180\n like one of them, the mice weren't able to walk,\n\n51:53.180 --> 51:55.380\n or their understanding of physics, I guess,\n\n51:55.380 --> 51:56.580\n is off or something like that.\n\n51:56.580 --> 51:59.940\n Yeah, the mental model when you're really young\n\n51:59.940 --> 52:03.460\n and you're kind of getting your mental model of physics,\n\n52:03.460 --> 52:07.020\n we do think that that would change kids abilities\n\n52:07.020 --> 52:09.020\n to if they were born in microgravity,\n\n52:09.020 --> 52:11.100\n their ability to have that intuition\n\n52:11.100 --> 52:13.860\n around an Earth based 1G environment might be missing,\n\n52:13.860 --> 52:15.340\n because a lot of that is really crystallized\n\n52:15.340 --> 52:17.820\n in early development, early childhood development.\n\n52:17.820 --> 52:20.060\n So that makes sense that they would see that in mice, yeah.\n\n52:20.060 --> 52:27.180\n So what about life when we choose to park our vehicles\n\n52:27.180 --> 52:30.500\n on another planet, on the moon, but let's go to Mars?\n\n52:30.500 --> 52:35.660\n First of all, is that excite you, humans going to Mars,\n\n52:35.660 --> 52:37.460\n like stepping foot on Mars?\n\n52:37.460 --> 52:38.820\n And when do you think it'll happen?\n\n52:38.820 --> 52:39.860\n It does excite me.\n\n52:39.860 --> 52:42.420\n I think visionaries like Elon are working\n\n52:42.420 --> 52:45.860\n to make that happen in terms of building the road to space.\n\n52:45.860 --> 52:48.460\n We are really excited about building out\n\n52:48.460 --> 52:51.420\n the human lived experience of space once you get there.\n\n52:51.420 --> 52:53.180\n So how are you going to grow your food?\n\n52:53.180 --> 52:55.220\n What is your habitat going to look like?\n\n52:55.220 --> 52:56.620\n I think it's profoundly exciting,\n\n52:56.620 --> 52:57.980\n but I do think that there's a little bit\n\n52:57.980 --> 53:02.420\n of a misunderstanding of Mars anywhere in the near future\n\n53:02.420 --> 53:04.980\n being anything like a replacement for Earth.\n\n53:04.980 --> 53:07.300\n So it is good for humanity to have these other pockets\n\n53:07.300 --> 53:10.020\n of our civilization that can expand out beyond Earth,\n\n53:10.020 --> 53:13.620\n but Mars is not in its current state,\n\n53:13.620 --> 53:15.780\n a good home for humanity.\n\n53:15.780 --> 53:17.420\n Too many perchlorates in the soil,\n\n53:17.420 --> 53:19.580\n you can't use that soil to grow crops.\n\n53:19.580 --> 53:21.820\n Atmosphere is too thin, certainly can't breathe it,\n\n53:21.820 --> 53:25.420\n but it's also just really thin compared to our atmosphere.\n\n53:25.420 --> 53:26.780\n A lot of different challenges that would have\n\n53:26.780 --> 53:29.700\n to be fundamentally changed on that planet\n\n53:29.700 --> 53:33.380\n to make it a good home for a large human civilization.\n\n53:33.380 --> 53:37.940\n How does a large civilization of humans get built on Mars?\n\n53:37.940 --> 53:42.540\n And where do you think it starts being difficult?\n\n53:42.540 --> 53:44.980\n So can you have a small base of like 10 people,\n\n53:44.980 --> 53:47.820\n essentially, kind of like the International Space Station\n\n53:47.820 --> 53:51.380\n kind of situation, and then can you get it to 100,\n\n53:51.380 --> 53:53.220\n to 1,000, to a million?\n\n53:53.220 --> 53:55.620\n Are there some interesting challenges there\n\n53:55.620 --> 53:58.900\n that worry you, saying that Mars is just not a good backup\n\n53:58.900 --> 54:00.980\n at this time for Earth?\n\n54:00.980 --> 54:04.060\n I think small outposts, absolutely, like McMurdo, right?\n\n54:04.060 --> 54:06.540\n So we have these models of really extreme environments\n\n54:06.540 --> 54:08.740\n on Earth in Antarctica, for example,\n\n54:08.740 --> 54:10.360\n where humans have been able to go\n\n54:10.360 --> 54:13.460\n and make a sustainable settlement.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:18.460\n McMurdo style life on Mars, probably feasible in the 2030s.\n\n54:18.760 --> 54:21.100\n So we want to send the first human missions to Mars\n\n54:21.100 --> 54:22.660\n and maybe as early as the end of this decade,\n\n54:22.660 --> 54:24.780\n more likely early 2030s.\n\n54:24.780 --> 54:28.060\n Moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place\n\n54:28.060 --> 54:31.060\n where like an entire human life would be lived,\n\n54:31.060 --> 54:33.460\n where it's not just you go for a three month deployment\n\n54:33.460 --> 54:36.820\n and you come back, that is actually the big challenge line,\n\n54:36.820 --> 54:41.420\n is just saying, is there enough technological sophistication\n\n54:41.420 --> 54:44.540\n that can be brought that far out into space?\n\n54:44.540 --> 54:46.540\n If you imagine your electronics break,\n\n54:46.540 --> 54:48.860\n there's no RadioShack, this dates me a little bit\n\n54:48.860 --> 54:50.340\n that my mind jumps to RadioShack,\n\n54:50.340 --> 54:54.140\n but there's no supply chains on Mars\n\n54:54.140 --> 54:58.100\n that can supply the level of technological sophistication\n\n54:58.100 --> 55:01.100\n for all the products that we rely on, on day to day life.\n\n55:01.100 --> 55:03.940\n So you'd be going back to actually a very simple existence,\n\n55:03.940 --> 55:06.000\n more like pioneer life out West,\n\n55:06.000 --> 55:08.700\n in the story of the US, for example.\n\n55:08.700 --> 55:13.140\n And I think that the future of larger scale gatherings\n\n55:13.140 --> 55:15.180\n of humans in orbit, or sorry, in space,\n\n55:15.180 --> 55:17.660\n is actually gonna be in microgravity,\n\n55:17.660 --> 55:21.260\n floating space cities, not so much trying\n\n55:21.260 --> 55:25.600\n to establish settlements on the surface.\n\n55:25.600 --> 55:29.500\n So you think sort of a significant engineering investment\n\n55:29.500 --> 55:31.420\n in terms of our efforts and money\n\n55:31.420 --> 55:34.420\n should be on large spaceships,\n\n55:34.420 --> 55:39.420\n that perhaps are doing this kind of self assembly,\n\n55:40.040 --> 55:41.960\n all these kinds of things, and doing it in orbit,\n\n55:41.960 --> 55:45.480\n maybe building a giant donut around the planet over time.\n\n55:45.480 --> 55:46.320\n Yeah, that is the goal.\n\n55:46.320 --> 55:48.240\n And I think the current political climate\n\n55:48.240 --> 55:52.340\n is such that you can't get the trillion dollar investment\n\n55:52.340 --> 55:56.760\n to start from scratch and build the sci fi megastructure.\n\n55:56.760 --> 55:58.960\n But if you can build it in fits and starts,\n\n55:58.960 --> 56:00.000\n in little different pieces,\n\n56:00.000 --> 56:02.000\n which is another advantage of self assembly,\n\n56:02.000 --> 56:04.160\n it's much more like how nature works.\n\n56:04.160 --> 56:07.600\n So it's biomimicry inspired way for humanity\n\n56:07.600 --> 56:09.760\n to scale out in space.\n\n56:09.760 --> 56:12.720\n And whether it's out in space or on Mars,\n\n56:12.720 --> 56:15.320\n the idea that sort of two people fall in love,\n\n56:16.240 --> 56:21.240\n they have sex, a child is born,\n\n56:21.560 --> 56:25.000\n and then that couple has to teach that child\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.600\n that they came from Earth.\n\n56:27.600 --> 56:30.560\n I just love the idea that somebody is born on Mars\n\n56:30.560 --> 56:33.400\n or out in space, and you have to be like,\n\n56:33.400 --> 56:36.400\n this is not actually like the original home.\n\n56:36.400 --> 56:38.940\n Just them looking at Earth and being like,\n\n56:38.940 --> 56:40.240\n this is where we came from.\n\n56:40.240 --> 56:42.040\n I don't know, that's really inspiring to me.\n\n56:42.040 --> 56:43.640\n And the child being really confused\n\n56:43.640 --> 56:45.800\n and then wanting to go back to TikTok,\n\n56:45.800 --> 56:47.520\n or whatever they do.\n\n56:47.520 --> 56:49.120\n Whatever they do in that area.\n\n56:49.120 --> 56:50.520\n I mean, there's great sci fi, right,\n\n56:50.520 --> 56:52.960\n about people being born on Mars.\n\n56:52.960 --> 56:55.000\n And because it's a lower gravity environment,\n\n56:55.000 --> 56:56.800\n they're taller, they're more gangly,\n\n56:56.800 --> 56:58.240\n if they were actually able to develop there.\n\n56:58.240 --> 56:59.360\n And then they come back to Earth\n\n56:59.360 --> 57:01.400\n and they're like second class citizens\n\n57:01.400 --> 57:04.080\n because they can't function here in the same way\n\n57:04.080 --> 57:06.080\n because the gravity's too strong for them.\n\n57:06.080 --> 57:07.800\n You see this in series like The Expanse\n\n57:07.800 --> 57:10.120\n with the Belters and these different societies\n\n57:10.120 --> 57:13.840\n that if we were to succeed in having human societies\n\n57:13.840 --> 57:14.960\n grow up in different pockets,\n\n57:14.960 --> 57:17.880\n it's not necessarily going to be easy for them\n\n57:17.880 --> 57:20.360\n to always come back to Earth as their home.\n\n57:20.360 --> 57:21.800\n Yeah, different cultures form,\n\n57:21.800 --> 57:23.440\n which is the positive way of phrasing it.\n\n57:23.440 --> 57:26.700\n But it's also, this human history teaches us\n\n57:26.700 --> 57:29.360\n that we like to form the other.\n\n57:29.360 --> 57:30.760\n So there's this kind of conflict\n\n57:30.760 --> 57:32.040\n that naturally emerges.\n\n57:33.080 --> 57:35.280\n Let me ask another sort of dark question.\n\n57:35.280 --> 57:37.980\n What do you think about coming from a military family?\n\n57:38.880 --> 57:43.360\n There's still sadly wars in the world.\n\n57:43.360 --> 57:46.440\n Do you think wars, military conflicts\n\n57:46.440 --> 57:51.340\n will follow us into space, wars between nations?\n\n57:51.340 --> 57:54.040\n Like from my perspective currently,\n\n57:54.040 --> 57:56.280\n it just seems like space is a place\n\n57:56.280 --> 58:00.120\n for scientists and engineers to explore ideas.\n\n58:00.120 --> 58:02.720\n But the more and more progress you make,\n\n58:02.720 --> 58:05.960\n does it worry you that nations start to step in\n\n58:05.960 --> 58:10.960\n and form, that go out and fall out military conflict,\n\n58:11.640 --> 58:15.620\n whether it's in cyberspace, in space,\n\n58:15.620 --> 58:18.400\n or actual hot war?\n\n58:18.400 --> 58:19.920\n I am really concerned about that.\n\n58:19.920 --> 58:22.040\n And I do think for decades,\n\n58:22.040 --> 58:23.600\n the scientific community in space\n\n58:23.600 --> 58:24.920\n has hung on to this notion\n\n58:24.920 --> 58:28.000\n from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,\n\n58:28.000 --> 58:30.400\n which is space is the province of all humankind,\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:32.800\n peaceful uses of outer space only.\n\n58:32.800 --> 58:35.000\n But I do think the rise in tensions\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.360\n and the geopolitical scene that we're seeing,\n\n58:38.400 --> 58:42.080\n I do harbor a lot of concern about hot wars\n\n58:42.080 --> 58:44.880\n following humanity out into space.\n\n58:44.880 --> 58:49.340\n And it's worth trying to tie nations together\n\n58:49.340 --> 58:51.960\n with more collaboration to avoid that happening.\n\n58:51.960 --> 58:53.760\n The International Space Station is a great example.\n\n58:53.760 --> 58:55.500\n I think it's something like 18 countries\n\n58:55.500 --> 58:57.040\n are party to this treaty.\n\n58:57.040 --> 58:59.360\n It might be less, it might be more.\n\n58:59.360 --> 59:01.120\n And then of course, there's a smaller number of countries\n\n59:01.120 --> 59:02.640\n that actually send astronauts.\n\n59:02.640 --> 59:05.640\n But even at the fall of the Soviet Union\n\n59:05.640 --> 59:07.920\n and through some tense times with Russia,\n\n59:07.920 --> 59:10.720\n the ISS had been a place where the US and Russia\n\n59:10.720 --> 59:13.960\n were actually able to collaborate between Mir and ISS.\n\n59:13.960 --> 59:17.080\n I think it'd be really important right now in particular\n\n59:17.080 --> 59:20.600\n to find other platforms where these hegemonic powers\n\n59:20.600 --> 59:23.480\n in the world and developing world nations\n\n59:23.480 --> 59:26.560\n can come and collaborate on the future of space\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:29.520\n and purposefully intertwine our success\n\n59:29.520 --> 59:31.280\n so that there's a danger to multiple parties\n\n59:31.280 --> 59:32.880\n if somebody is a bad actor.\n\n59:32.880 --> 59:36.480\n So we're now talking as there's a war in Ukraine\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:37.840\n and I haven't been sleeping much.\n\n59:37.840 --> 59:42.840\n I have family, friends, colleagues in both countries.\n\n59:43.120 --> 59:45.480\n And I'm just talking to a lot of people,\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:48.720\n many of whom are crying, refugees.\n\n59:48.720 --> 59:52.640\n And there's a basic human compassion\n\n59:52.640 --> 59:55.760\n and love for each other that I believe technology\n\n59:55.760 --> 59:59.120\n can help catalyze and accelerate.\n\n59:59.120 --> 1:00:00.440\n But there's also science.\n\n1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:02.160\n There's something about rockets.\n\n1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.800\n There's something about, and I mean like space exploration\n\n1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:10.800\n that inspires the world about the positive possibilities\n\n1:00:13.800 --> 1:00:15.600\n of the human species.\n\n1:00:15.600 --> 1:00:18.760\n So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India\n\n1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:22.840\n and the United States and Europe and everywhere else,\n\n1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:27.840\n it seems like collaborating on giant space projects\n\n1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:30.080\n is one way to escape these wars,\n\n1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:33.720\n to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts.\n\n1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:34.560\n I mean, there's something,\n\n1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:37.440\n there's so much camaraderie to the whole thing.\n\n1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:42.440\n And even in this little period of human history\n\n1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.480\n we're living through, it seems like that's essential.\n\n1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.720\n Even through this pandemic,\n\n1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:49.720\n there's something so inspiring about those\n\n1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:52.280\n like SpaceX rockets going up, for example.\n\n1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:57.080\n This reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts\n\n1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:59.520\n by the commercial sector, I don't know.\n\n1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:03.120\n That was, as many of us have,\n\n1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:06.360\n sort of some dark times during this pandemic,\n\n1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:10.120\n just like loneliness and sometimes emotion and anger\n\n1:01:10.120 --> 1:01:13.640\n and just hopelessness and politics.\n\n1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:15.680\n And then you look at those rockets going up\n\n1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:17.120\n and it just gives you hope.\n\n1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:21.360\n So I think that's an understated sort of value\n\n1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:22.920\n of space exploration,\n\n1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:26.320\n is the thing that unites us and gives us hope.\n\n1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:29.120\n Obviously also inspires young generations\n\n1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.480\n and young minds to also contribute\n\n1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:33.000\n in not necessarily in space exploration\n\n1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.400\n but in all of science and literature and poetry.\n\n1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.120\n There's something about when you look up to the stars\n\n1:01:38.120 --> 1:01:39.760\n that makes you dream.\n\n1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:40.600\n Very true.\n\n1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:43.560\n And so that's a really good reason\n\n1:01:43.560 --> 1:01:45.040\n to sort of invest in this,\n\n1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:47.120\n whether it's building giant megastructure,\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.400\n which is so freaking cool,\n\n1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:52.680\n but also colonizing Mars.\n\n1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:54.960\n Yeah, it's something to look forward to.\n\n1:01:55.960 --> 1:02:00.960\n Something that, and not make it a domain of war,\n\n1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:04.520\n but a domain of human collaboration\n\n1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:06.800\n and human compassion, I think.\n\n1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:09.240\n You're the founder and director\n\n1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:12.240\n of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.\n\n1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.440\n It includes a ton of projects.\n\n1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:18.520\n So I just wanted to, they're focused, I guess, on life in space\n\n1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:22.160\n from astrobiology, like we talked about, to habitats.\n\n1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:23.800\n Are there some other interesting projects,\n\n1:02:23.800 --> 1:02:27.440\n part of this initiative that pop to mind\n\n1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:29.280\n that you find particularly cool?\n\n1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:30.280\n Absolutely.\n\n1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:33.320\n One is the future of in space manufacturing.\n\n1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:35.720\n So if we're gonna build large scale space structures,\n\n1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:37.760\n yes, it's great to ship them up from Earth\n\n1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:39.200\n and self assemble them.\n\n1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:41.880\n But what about extrusion in orbit?\n\n1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:43.760\n It's one of the best technologies\n\n1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.240\n to leverage in microgravity\n\n1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:48.440\n because you can extrude a particularly long beam\n\n1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:51.000\n that would sag in a normal gravity environment,\n\n1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.560\n but might be able to become the basis of a truss\n\n1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:55.080\n or a large scale space structure.\n\n1:02:55.080 --> 1:02:57.920\n So we're doing miniature tests of extrusion\n\n1:02:57.920 --> 1:02:59.280\n and are excited to fly this\n\n1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:01.840\n on the International Space Station in a few months.\n\n1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.280\n We are working on swarm robots.\n\n1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:08.840\n We have just announced actually MIT's return to the moon.\n\n1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:11.480\n So my organization is leading this mission for MIT,\n\n1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:12.920\n going back to the surface of the moon\n\n1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:15.480\n as early as the end of this year, 2022,\n\n1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:17.440\n maybe early 2023,\n\n1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:21.640\n and trying to take data from our research payloads\n\n1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:24.440\n at this historic South Pole site\n\n1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:27.120\n where NASA is supposed to send the first humans back\n\n1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:28.200\n on the Artemis III mission.\n\n1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.720\n So our hope is to directly support that human mission\n\n1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.120\n with our data.\n\n1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:34.400\n How does that connect to the swarm aspects?\n\n1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:35.680\n Does it connect?\n\n1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:37.000\n Yeah, so we're actually gonna fly\n\n1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.400\n one of the little astro ants.\n\n1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:39.840\n That's the current plan.\n\n1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:42.800\n One of the little swarm robots on the top of a rover.\n\n1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:44.320\n That's part of the mission.\n\n1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:45.640\n Ants riding a rover?\n\n1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:48.160\n Yes, exactly, an ant riding a rover.\n\n1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:49.840\n That rover gets packed in a lander.\n\n1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.000\n That lander gets packed in a SpaceX rocket.\n\n1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.880\n So it's a whole nesting dolls situation\n\n1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:55.440\n to get to the moon.\n\n1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:57.200\n Mother of robot dragons.\n\n1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:58.640\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:01.560\n So this one, a swarm of one?\n\n1:04:01.560 --> 1:04:02.720\n Swarm of one, exactly.\n\n1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:03.720\n We're testing out.\n\n1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:05.480\n It's a tech demonstration mission,\n\n1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:06.840\n not a true swarm.\n\n1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:07.680\n Yeah, there they are.\n\n1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:09.200\n Those are the astro ants.\n\n1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.600\n Wow, and this was a distributed system,\n\n1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:14.200\n and in theory, you could have a ton of these.\n\n1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:15.880\n Yes, these could also be centralized.\n\n1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:17.400\n So they have wireless technology\n\n1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:19.840\n that could also talk to a central base station\n\n1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:22.520\n and will be assessing kind of case by case\n\n1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:23.880\n whether it makes sense to operate them\n\n1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:25.120\n in a decentralized swarm\n\n1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:27.800\n or to command them in a centralized swarm.\n\n1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:32.200\n Each robot is equipped with four magnetic wheels\n\n1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:35.680\n which enable the robot to attach to any magnetic surface\n\n1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:37.760\n so you can operate basically in any environment.\n\n1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:41.000\n He tested the, we tested the mobility of all robots\n\n1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.840\n on different materials in a microgravity environment.\n\n1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:46.960\n On the vomit comet prior to going to the moon.\n\n1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:48.360\n That must look so cool.\n\n1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:50.720\n So they're basically moving along different\n\n1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:52.120\n like metallic surfaces.\n\n1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:53.160\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:56.480\n It's interesting when you, just a minute ago\n\n1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:58.360\n talking about the reflection of\n\n1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:01.920\n how space can be so aspirational and so uniting.\n\n1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:03.720\n There's a great quote from Bill Anders\n\n1:05:03.720 --> 1:05:05.320\n from the Apollo 8 mission to the moon,\n\n1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:08.280\n which is he, it's the Earthrise photo that was taken\n\n1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:09.720\n where you see the Earth coming up\n\n1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:11.080\n over the horizon of the moon.\n\n1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:12.840\n And the quote is something along the lines of\n\n1:05:12.840 --> 1:05:15.200\n we came all the way to discover the moon\n\n1:05:15.200 --> 1:05:17.880\n and what we really discovered was the Earth.\n\n1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:20.080\n This really powerful image looking back.\n\n1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:22.360\n And so we're also trying to think for our lunar mission\n\n1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:24.560\n we realized we're a very privileged group at MIT\n\n1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:26.280\n to get the opportunity to do this.\n\n1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:29.000\n How could we bring humanity along with us?\n\n1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.080\n And so one of the things we're still testing out\n\n1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:32.760\n I don't know if we're gonna be able to swing it\n\n1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:35.560\n would be to do something like a Twitch plays Pokemon\n\n1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:36.880\n but with the robot.\n\n1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.560\n So let a lot of people on earth actually control the robot\n\n1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:42.000\n or at least benefit from the data that we're gathering\n\n1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.040\n and try to release the data openly.\n\n1:05:44.040 --> 1:05:45.560\n So we're exploring a couple of different ideas\n\n1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:48.360\n for how do we engage more people in this mission.\n\n1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:51.440\n That would be surreal to be able to interact\n\n1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:53.920\n in some way with the thing that's out there.\n\n1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:54.760\n Exactly.\n\n1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:55.600\n On another surface.\n\n1:05:55.600 --> 1:05:56.600\n Direct connection.\n\n1:05:56.600 --> 1:05:57.720\n Direct connection.\n\n1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.320\n I think about artificial intelligence in that same way\n\n1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:04.840\n which is like building robots\n\n1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:07.360\n puts a mirror to us humans.\n\n1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:09.320\n It makes us like wonder about like\n\n1:06:09.320 --> 1:06:10.520\n what is intelligence?\n\n1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:11.640\n What is consciousness?\n\n1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:14.560\n And what is actually valuable about human beings?\n\n1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:18.320\n When AI system learns to play chess better than humans\n\n1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:19.760\n you start to let go of this idea\n\n1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:22.800\n that humans are special because of intelligence.\n\n1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.680\n It's something else.\n\n1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:29.160\n It's maybe the flame of human consciousness.\n\n1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:32.680\n It's the capacity to feel deeply\n\n1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:36.360\n to sort of to both suffer and to love all those things.\n\n1:06:36.360 --> 1:06:39.800\n And that somehow AI to me sort of puts a mirror to that.\n\n1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:41.880\n You mentioned HAL 9000.\n\n1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:46.400\n You have to bring it up with these swarm bots\n\n1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:50.840\n crawling on the surface of your cocoon in space.\n\n1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:52.440\n I mean, all right.\n\n1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:56.680\n Let me steel man the HAL 9000 perspective here.\n\n1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:57.520\n Okay.\n\n1:06:58.920 --> 1:07:02.120\n The poor guy just wanted to maintain the mission\n\n1:07:02.120 --> 1:07:03.200\n and the astronauts were,\n\n1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:05.680\n I mean, I don't know if people often talk about that\n\n1:07:05.680 --> 1:07:10.080\n but like doctors have to make difficult decisions too.\n\n1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:11.600\n When there's limited resources\n\n1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:14.040\n you actually do have to sacrifice human life often\n\n1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:16.680\n because you have to make decisions.\n\n1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:20.120\n And I think HAL is probably making that kind of decision\n\n1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:22.800\n about what's more important,\n\n1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:26.640\n the lives of individual astronauts or the mission.\n\n1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:30.200\n And I feel like AI and other humans\n\n1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:33.000\n will need to make these decisions.\n\n1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.160\n And it also feels like AI systems will need to help\n\n1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:38.920\n make those decisions.\n\n1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:40.200\n I don't know.\n\n1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:42.680\n I guess my question is about\n\n1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:46.000\n greater and greater collective intelligence by systems.\n\n1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.560\n Do you worry about that?\n\n1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:54.720\n What is the right way to sort of solve this problem\n\n1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:56.000\n keeping a human in the loop?\n\n1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.480\n Do you think about this kind of stuff\n\n1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:00.040\n or are they sufficiently dumb now the robots\n\n1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:03.480\n that that's not yet on the horizon to think about?\n\n1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:04.840\n I think it should be on the horizon.\n\n1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:06.560\n It's always good to think about these things early\n\n1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:09.280\n because we make a lot of technical design decisions\n\n1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:11.160\n at this phase working with swarm robots\n\n1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:12.600\n that it would be better to have thought\n\n1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:13.920\n about some of these questions early\n\n1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:16.320\n in the life cycle of a project.\n\n1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:18.600\n There is a real interest in NASA right now\n\n1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:21.640\n thinking about the future of human robot interaction, HRI,\n\n1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:22.920\n and what is the right synergy\n\n1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:25.800\n in terms of level of control for the human\n\n1:08:25.800 --> 1:08:29.120\n versus level of dependence or control for the robot.\n\n1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:33.560\n And we're beginning to test out more of these scenarios.\n\n1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:36.080\n For example, the Gateway Space Station,\n\n1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:37.920\n which is meant to be in orbit around the moon\n\n1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:40.680\n as a staging base for the surface operations,\n\n1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.640\n is meant to be able to function autonomously\n\n1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:46.360\n with no humans in it for months at a time\n\n1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:47.800\n because they think it's gonna be seasonal.\n\n1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:50.160\n They think we might not be constantly staffing it.\n\n1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:51.800\n So this will be a really great test of,\n\n1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.480\n I don't know that anybody's yet worried\n\n1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.280\n about HAL 9000 evolving,\n\n1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:58.800\n but certainly just the robustness of some of these AI systems\n\n1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:01.840\n that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station\n\n1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:06.080\n while the humans are away or detection algorithms\n\n1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:07.960\n that are gonna say, if you had a human pilot,\n\n1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:09.920\n they might see debris in orbit and steer around it.\n\n1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:11.280\n There'll be a lot of autonomous navigation\n\n1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:12.800\n that has to happen.\n\n1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.160\n That'll be one of the early test beds\n\n1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.640\n where we'll start to get a little bit closer to that future.\n\n1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.400\n Well, the HRI component is really interesting to me,\n\n1:09:20.880 --> 1:09:24.760\n especially when the I includes like almost friendship\n\n1:09:24.760 --> 1:09:27.560\n because people don't realize this, I think,\n\n1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:29.840\n that we humans long for connection.\n\n1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:32.320\n And when you have even a basic interaction\n\n1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.280\n that's just like supposed to be just like serving you\n\n1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.680\n or something, you still project,\n\n1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:42.680\n it's still a source of meaning and connection.\n\n1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:47.040\n And so you do have to think about that.\n\n1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:51.520\n I mean, HAL 9000, the movie maybe doesn't portray it\n\n1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:53.800\n that way, but I'm sure there's a relationship there\n\n1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:56.240\n between the astronauts and the robot,\n\n1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.800\n especially when you have greater and greater level\n\n1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:58.720\n of intelligence.\n\n1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:02.960\n And maybe that addresses the happiness question too.\n\n1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:06.320\n Yeah, I think there's a great book by Kate Darling,\n\n1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:08.200\n who's one of my colleagues at MIT.\n\n1:10:08.200 --> 1:10:09.480\n Yeah, she's amazing.\n\n1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.520\n She's already been on this podcast,\n\n1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:14.760\n but we talk all the time and we're supposed to talk\n\n1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.200\n and we've been missing each other\n\n1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.000\n and we're gonna make it happen soon.\n\n1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:18.840\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:20.520\n Come down to Texas, Kate.\n\n1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:22.320\n All right, anyway, yeah, she's amazing.\n\n1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:25.160\n She has this book, her whole work is about this.\n\n1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:26.520\n Connection with robots, yeah.\n\n1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:28.440\n This beautiful connection that we have with robots,\n\n1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:30.600\n but I think it's greater and greater importance\n\n1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:32.240\n when it's out in space,\n\n1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:34.920\n because it could help alleviate some of the loneliness.\n\n1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:35.760\n Right.\n\n1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:37.360\n One of the projects in the book that I gave you,\n\n1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:39.040\n which is this catalog of the projects\n\n1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:40.760\n that we've worked on over the last five years,\n\n1:10:40.760 --> 1:10:43.960\n is this social robot that was developed at the Media Lab.\n\n1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:46.320\n And we, one of the first years in 2017\n\n1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:47.920\n that we flew a zero G flight,\n\n1:10:47.920 --> 1:10:49.680\n we took the social robot along\n\n1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:50.760\n and tried to do a little bit\n\n1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:53.000\n of a very scaled down human study\n\n1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.080\n to look at these questions,\n\n1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:56.880\n because you do imagine that we would form a bond,\n\n1:10:56.880 --> 1:10:58.840\n a real bond with the social robots\n\n1:10:58.840 --> 1:11:01.600\n that might be not just serving us on a mission,\n\n1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:04.480\n but really be our teammates on a future mission.\n\n1:11:04.480 --> 1:11:06.640\n And I do think that that could have a powerful role\n\n1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:08.680\n in the mental health and just the stability of a crew\n\n1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.880\n is to have some other robot friends come along.\n\n1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:13.320\n What do you, by the way, the book you mentioned\n\n1:11:13.320 --> 1:11:18.320\n is into the Anthropocosmos,\n\n1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.000\n a whole space catalog from the space catalog.\n\n1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:22.840\n Get that reference.\n\n1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:25.240\n Yeah, so call out to Earth catalog,\n\n1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:26.320\n a whole space catalog\n\n1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:29.440\n from the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.\n\n1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:31.880\n What about the happiness?\n\n1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:33.920\n You said that that's one of the problems\n\n1:11:33.920 --> 1:11:35.880\n of when you're out in space.\n\n1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:37.480\n How do you keep humans happy?\n\n1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:38.760\n Again, asking for a friend.\n\n1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.920\n Yes, I mean, one of the big challenges\n\n1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:43.440\n is you can't just open a window\n\n1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:45.920\n or walk out a door and blow off steam, right?\n\n1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:49.280\n You can't just go somewhere to clear your head.\n\n1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:52.760\n And in that sense, you need to build habitats\n\n1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:56.920\n that are homes that really care for the humans inside them\n\n1:11:56.920 --> 1:11:59.240\n and have, whether it's biophilia\n\n1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:02.040\n and a place where you can go and feel like you're in nature\n\n1:12:02.040 --> 1:12:06.920\n or a VR headset, which for some people is a poor simulacrum\n\n1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:09.200\n but is maybe better than nothing.\n\n1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:10.280\n You need to be thinking\n\n1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:12.920\n about these technological interventions\n\n1:12:12.920 --> 1:12:14.960\n that are gonna have to be part of your home\n\n1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:17.720\n and be part of your maybe day to day ritual\n\n1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:20.760\n to keep you steady and balanced and happy\n\n1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:22.840\n or feeling fulfilled.\n\n1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:25.600\n What about other humans, relationship with other humans?\n\n1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:28.000\n Do those get weird\n\n1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.360\n when you get past a certain number of humans?\n\n1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:31.600\n I'm not an expert in this area\n\n1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:33.040\n but an anecdote that I'll share.\n\n1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:36.240\n My understanding is that NASA has still not decided\n\n1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.400\n whether it's better to send married couples\n\n1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:41.040\n or single crew members in terms of,\n\n1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:43.040\n you want some level of stability,\n\n1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:45.560\n you don't wanna have the drama of romantic relationships\n\n1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:47.600\n like you're alluding to before,\n\n1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:50.600\n but they can't decide because married couples also fight\n\n1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.080\n and have a really tough dynamic.\n\n1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:54.400\n And so there's a lot of open questions still to answer\n\n1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:57.520\n about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?\n\n1:12:57.520 --> 1:12:59.800\n And we're starting to test some of these things\n\n1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:01.720\n with the civilian crews that are growing up\n\n1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:04.120\n with Inspiration4, like last fall with SpaceX\n\n1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:07.360\n and Axe One that's gonna fly in a few days here in March.\n\n1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:10.920\n As we begin to lengthen the time of those civilian crews,\n\n1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:12.440\n I think we'll start to learn a little bit more\n\n1:13:12.440 --> 1:13:15.800\n about just average everyday human to human dynamics\n\n1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.280\n and not the astronauts that are themselves selected\n\n1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:21.600\n to be perfect human specimens, very good to work with,\n\n1:13:21.600 --> 1:13:23.040\n easy to get along with.\n\n1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:26.360\n I wish you collected more data about this pandemic\n\n1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.240\n because I feel like it's a good rough simulation\n\n1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.440\n of what it'd be like out in space.\n\n1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:33.520\n A lot of people are locked down, some married couples,\n\n1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:35.360\n I think a lot of marriages broke up,\n\n1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:38.400\n a lot of marriages got closer together.\n\n1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:41.120\n So it's like, and then the single people,\n\n1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.120\n some of them went off the cliff\n\n1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:45.680\n and some of them discovered their new happiness\n\n1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:46.840\n and meaning and so on.\n\n1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:50.080\n It's a beautiful little experiment, a painful one.\n\n1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:52.580\n Is there a thorough way to really test that?\n\n1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:56.720\n Because it's such a costly experiment\n\n1:13:58.560 --> 1:13:59.800\n to send humans up there,\n\n1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:01.560\n but I guess you can always return back to Earth\n\n1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:02.760\n if it's not working out.\n\n1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:04.600\n That's what we hope, that's what you hope.\n\n1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:06.960\n You don't have like a Apollo 13 situation\n\n1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.040\n that doesn't quite make it back.\n\n1:14:08.040 --> 1:14:11.920\n But yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge.\n\n1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.560\n The moon is only three days away.\n\n1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:15.280\n That's a lot quicker to recover from\n\n1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:17.040\n if there's a psychological problem with the crew\n\n1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.400\n or any type of maintenance problem, anything.\n\n1:14:19.400 --> 1:14:23.680\n Three years is such a challenge\n\n1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:25.020\n compared to these other domains\n\n1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:26.240\n that we've been getting more used to\n\n1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:27.960\n in terms of human spaceflight.\n\n1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:30.760\n So this is a question that we will need to have explored more\n\n1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:33.000\n before we start really sending crews to Mars.\n\n1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:38.000\n So you're a young scientist, do you think in your lifetime\n\n1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:43.480\n you will go out into orbit,\n\n1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:47.360\n you will go out beyond into deep space\n\n1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:50.380\n and potentially step, you,\n\n1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:53.320\n I don't know if you can call yourself a civilian.\n\n1:14:53.320 --> 1:14:54.740\n I don't know if that's what you count as,\n\n1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:59.740\n but you as a curious ant from MIT land step on Mars.\n\n1:15:03.660 --> 1:15:04.500\n Yes.\n\n1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:07.080\n That's a firm, that's a firm.\n\n1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:07.920\n Are you coming back?\n\n1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:08.980\n Firm, yes, yeah, I'm coming back.\n\n1:15:08.980 --> 1:15:12.080\n I don't want that one way mission, I want the two way mission.\n\n1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:14.220\n But yes, I mean, I think we're already talking\n\n1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:16.240\n about a pretty near term opportunity\n\n1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:17.900\n where I could send graduate students\n\n1:15:17.900 --> 1:15:19.140\n to the International Space Station.\n\n1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:24.140\n Yeah, not a sacrifice, but send graduate students.\n\n1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:25.840\n For the experience.\n\n1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:26.960\n For the experience.\n\n1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:29.440\n Send graduate students to the ISS to do their research.\n\n1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.720\n I do think you and I both would have an opportunity\n\n1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:35.640\n to go to a lunar base of some sort within our lifetime.\n\n1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:39.620\n And there's a good chance if we really wanted to,\n\n1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:41.760\n we might have to really advocate for it,\n\n1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:43.280\n apply to an astronaut program.\n\n1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:45.120\n There will be some avenues for humans\n\n1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.800\n in our lifetime to go to Mars.\n\n1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:51.080\n What's the bar for like health?\n\n1:15:51.080 --> 1:15:53.380\n Do you think that bar will keep getting lower and lower\n\n1:15:53.380 --> 1:15:55.320\n in terms of how healthy, how athletic,\n\n1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:57.880\n like how the psychological profile,\n\n1:15:57.880 --> 1:15:59.000\n all those kinds of things?\n\n1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.600\n Yeah, for one, we're gonna build more robust habitats\n\n1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.360\n that don't depend on astronauts\n\n1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:05.320\n being so impeccably well trained.\n\n1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.280\n So we're gonna make it better for inclusion\n\n1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.480\n and just opening access to space.\n\n1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:12.800\n But there's a fantastic group called Astro Access\n\n1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:15.480\n that is already helping disabled space flyers\n\n1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:18.480\n do zero G flights and potentially get access to the ISS.\n\n1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:19.840\n And some of the things that we think of\n\n1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:24.800\n as disabilities on earth are hyper abilities in space.\n\n1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.520\n You don't need really powerful legs in space.\n\n1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.760\n What you'd really benefit from having is a third arm,\n\n1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.360\n more ways to kind of move yourself around\n\n1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:33.640\n and grip and interact.\n\n1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.040\n So we are already seeing a much more open minded approach\n\n1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:40.840\n to who gets to go to space and Astro Access\n\n1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:43.440\n is a wonderful organization doing some of that work.\n\n1:16:43.440 --> 1:16:47.640\n I'm hoping introversion will also be a superpower in space.\n\n1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:50.000\n Okay, well, first I'd love to get your opinion\n\n1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:52.640\n on commercial space flight, what SpaceX,\n\n1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.200\n what Blue Origin are doing.\n\n1:16:54.200 --> 1:16:57.720\n And also another question on top of that is,\n\n1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:01.360\n because you've worked with a lot of different kinds\n\n1:17:01.360 --> 1:17:03.240\n of people, culturally, what's the difference\n\n1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:07.960\n between SpaceX or commercial type of efforts\n\n1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:10.800\n NASA and MIT?\n\n1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:11.760\n And academia.\n\n1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:12.720\n Academia.\n\n1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.440\n Yeah, so the first part of your question,\n\n1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:18.360\n I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space.\n\n1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.000\n It has really empowered our program.\n\n1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.480\n So instead of me waiting for five years to get a grant\n\n1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:24.600\n and get the money from the grant\n\n1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:26.920\n and only then can you send a project to space,\n\n1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:29.640\n I go out and I fundraise a lot like a startup founder\n\n1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.440\n and I directly buy access to space\n\n1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:33.600\n on the International Space Station\n\n1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:36.160\n through SpaceX or NanoRacks, same with Blue Origin\n\n1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:38.720\n and their suborbital craft, same with Axiom now.\n\n1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.480\n Axiom's making plans for their own commercial space station.\n\n1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:44.200\n It's not out of the realm of possibility,\n\n1:17:44.200 --> 1:17:48.360\n but in a few years, I will rent lab space in orbit.\n\n1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:50.920\n I will rent a module from the Axiom space station\n\n1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.000\n or the orbital reef, which is the Blue Origin space station\n\n1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.840\n or NanoRacks is thinking about Starlab Oasis.\n\n1:17:56.840 --> 1:17:58.000\n There's probably some other companies\n\n1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:59.040\n that I'm not even aware of yet\n\n1:17:59.040 --> 1:18:00.880\n that are doing commercial space habitats.\n\n1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:02.800\n So I think that's fabulous\n\n1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:04.800\n and really empowering for our research.\n\n1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.320\n Is it affordable?\n\n1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:09.800\n So like loosely speaking, does it become affordable\n\n1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:13.800\n for like MIT type of research lab?\n\n1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:18.200\n Does it, or does it need to be a multi university\n\n1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:20.800\n like a gigantic effort, a consortium thing?\n\n1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:22.800\n One of the reasons we're spinning out Aurelia\n\n1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:24.640\n is we actually realized it's cheap enough.\n\n1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:26.640\n It doesn't even have to be MIT.\n\n1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:29.640\n And we wanted to start democratizing access\n\n1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:30.960\n to these spaceflight opportunities\n\n1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:33.040\n to a much broader swath of humanity.\n\n1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:36.640\n Could you take a Khan Academy educational course\n\n1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.800\n about, hey, students around the world,\n\n1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:40.720\n this is how you get ready for a zero G flight.\n\n1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:43.280\n And by the way, come fly with us next year,\n\n1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:44.800\n which is something we're gonna do with Aurelius.\n\n1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:48.120\n We're gonna bring much more just kind of day to day folks\n\n1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:50.280\n on zero G flights and get them access\n\n1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:52.600\n to engaging in the space industry.\n\n1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:54.720\n So it's become cheap enough\n\n1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:57.000\n and the prices have dropped enough to consider even that.\n\n1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:57.960\n So that's amazing.\n\n1:18:57.960 --> 1:18:59.360\n It definitely doesn't have to be a consortium\n\n1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:00.880\n of universities anymore.\n\n1:19:00.880 --> 1:19:02.040\n Depends on what you wanna fly.\n\n1:19:02.040 --> 1:19:03.440\n If you wanna fly James Webb,\n\n1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:05.880\n a huge telescope that's decades in the making,\n\n1:19:05.880 --> 1:19:08.920\n sure, you need a NASA allocation budget.\n\n1:19:08.920 --> 1:19:10.520\n You need billions.\n\n1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:12.480\n But for a lot of the stuff in the book\n\n1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:13.600\n and our research portfolio,\n\n1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:16.000\n it's actually becoming far more accessible.\n\n1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:17.520\n So that's a commercial.\n\n1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:21.200\n What about NASA and MIT academia?\n\n1:19:21.200 --> 1:19:25.720\n Yeah, I think people have been worried about NASA\n\n1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:28.400\n the last few years because in some people's minds,\n\n1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:31.600\n they are ceding ground to these commercial efforts,\n\n1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:34.360\n but that's really not what's happening.\n\n1:19:34.360 --> 1:19:37.560\n NASA empowered these commercial efforts\n\n1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:40.080\n because they wanna free themselves up to go to Mars\n\n1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:43.000\n and go to Europa and continue being\n\n1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.000\n that really aspirational force for humanity\n\n1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.760\n of pushing the boundary, always pushing the boundary.\n\n1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:50.840\n And if they were anchored in low earth orbit,\n\n1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:53.200\n maintaining a space station indefinitely,\n\n1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:54.800\n that's so much a part of their budget\n\n1:19:54.800 --> 1:19:57.120\n that it was keeping them from being able to do more.\n\n1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:59.000\n So it actually is really fantastic for NASA\n\n1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:00.920\n to have grown this commercial ecosystem\n\n1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:03.040\n and then that frees NASA up to go further.\n\n1:20:03.040 --> 1:20:05.400\n And in academia, we like to think that we will be able\n\n1:20:05.400 --> 1:20:09.480\n to do the provocative next generation research\n\n1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:13.120\n that is going to unlock things at that frontier.\n\n1:20:13.120 --> 1:20:14.920\n And we can partner with NASA.\n\n1:20:14.920 --> 1:20:15.960\n We can go through a program\n\n1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:18.160\n if we wanna send a probe out really far,\n\n1:20:18.160 --> 1:20:19.560\n but we can also partner with SpaceX\n\n1:20:19.560 --> 1:20:22.720\n and see what human life in a SpaceX Mars settlement\n\n1:20:22.720 --> 1:20:24.880\n might look like and how we could design for that.\n\n1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:27.600\n Speaking of projects, maybe are there other projects\n\n1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:30.120\n that pop to mind from the Space Exploration Initiative\n\n1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:32.800\n or maybe stuff from the book that you can mention?\n\n1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:34.280\n Something super cool.\n\n1:20:34.280 --> 1:20:35.800\n I mean, everything we've been talking about is cool,\n\n1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:37.800\n but just something that pops to mind again.\n\n1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:40.520\n Yeah, so we talked about life in space\n\n1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:42.680\n and you might need more arms than legs.\n\n1:20:42.680 --> 1:20:44.800\n One of the projects by Valentina Sumini\n\n1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:48.680\n was a air powered robotics tail.\n\n1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:50.400\n So it's a soft robotics tail\n\n1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:53.000\n that essentially has a little camera on the back end of it,\n\n1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.680\n can do computer vision and knows where to grapple.\n\n1:20:55.680 --> 1:20:56.840\n So it's behind you.\n\n1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:59.320\n It grapples onto something and holds you in space\n\n1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:00.440\n and then you can actually free up\n\n1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:02.080\n both of your hands to work.\n\n1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:03.400\n So we're already starting to think about\n\n1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.040\n the design of bionic humans or prosthetics\n\n1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:09.240\n or things that would make you kind of like a cyborg\n\n1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.600\n to augment your capabilities\n\n1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:13.160\n when you're in a space environment.\n\n1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:14.600\n How would you control something like that?\n\n1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:17.960\n So it's kind of like a, I mean, you can't call it a leg,\n\n1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:20.280\n but whatever, it's a. An additional appendage.\n\n1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:21.760\n Appendage, so how would you,\n\n1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:23.840\n what are ideas for controlling something like that?\n\n1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:26.560\n Yeah, so right now it's super, yeah, there you go.\n\n1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:27.400\n That's cool.\n\n1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:29.720\n Right now it's super manual.\n\n1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:32.400\n It's basically just like a kind of a set pattern\n\n1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:34.160\n of inflating as we're testing it.\n\n1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.960\n But in the future, if we had a Neuralink,\n\n1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:38.000\n I mean, this is something that you could imagine\n\n1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.000\n directly controlling,\n\n1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.360\n just thinking thoughts and controlling it.\n\n1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.560\n That's a ways away.\n\n1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:45.360\n Yeah, so we talked about on the biology side,\n\n1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:47.800\n astrobiology, there's probably agriculture stuff.\n\n1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:51.240\n Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem\n\n1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:53.160\n of out in space for survival\n\n1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:56.200\n or the robotics architectures, the self assembly stuff?\n\n1:21:56.200 --> 1:21:59.000\n So kind of combining something we were talking about,\n\n1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.040\n you can form these relationships with objects\n\n1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:02.640\n and anthropomorphize.\n\n1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:04.840\n One of the things that we're thinking about for agriculture\n\n1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:08.720\n created by Manwe and Somu, so two students at MIT,\n\n1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:10.880\n was this little, it looks like a planet,\n\n1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.160\n but it's inspired by, I think, a Mandala\n\n1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:15.000\n or Nepalese spinning wheel.\n\n1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.680\n And you plant plants on the inside\n\n1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:19.160\n and the astronaut has to spin it every day\n\n1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:20.920\n to help the plants survive.\n\n1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:22.520\n So it's a way to give the astronauts\n\n1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:23.960\n something to care about,\n\n1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:26.400\n something that they are responsible for keeping alive\n\n1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:29.120\n and can really invest themselves in.\n\n1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:30.600\n And it's not necessary, right?\n\n1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:33.560\n We have other ways to grow in orbit,\n\n1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:35.120\n hydroponics, liquid medium,\n\n1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:37.480\n trying to keep the liquid around the plant roots is hard\n\n1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:39.080\n because there's no gravity to pull it down\n\n1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:40.440\n in a particular direction.\n\n1:22:40.440 --> 1:22:42.680\n But what I loved about this project was they said,\n\n1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:45.600\n sure, we have ways that the plants could grow on their own,\n\n1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:48.040\n but the astronauts might want to care for it\n\n1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:49.680\n in the same way that we have little plants\n\n1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:52.680\n that come to be important to us, little plant friends.\n\n1:22:52.680 --> 1:22:54.480\n So there's AgriFuge, that's an early model\n\n1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:58.040\n of this manually spinning plant habitat.\n\n1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:01.520\n I guess this is the best of academic research\n\n1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:03.520\n is you can do these kinds of wild ideas.\n\n1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:04.520\n Wild ideas, yeah.\n\n1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:07.240\n Well, I get to spend quite a bit of time\n\n1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:12.000\n with Mr. Elon Musk and he's very stressed,\n\n1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.520\n especially about Starship\n\n1:23:14.520 --> 1:23:16.520\n and all those kinds of engineering efforts.\n\n1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:20.600\n What do you think about how damn hard it is\n\n1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:23.520\n to get out of space?\n\n1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:25.680\n Like, are we humans gonna be able to do this?\n\n1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:28.880\n I don't know, I think it feels like\n\n1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:31.400\n it's an engineering problem, it's a scientific problem,\n\n1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:33.400\n but it's also just a motivation problem\n\n1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:35.400\n for the entire human species.\n\n1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:39.520\n And you also need to have superstar researchers\n\n1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:40.800\n and engineers working on it.\n\n1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:42.920\n So you have to get like the best people in the world,\n\n1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:47.200\n inspire them and starting from a young age and kind of.\n\n1:23:47.200 --> 1:23:48.920\n Almost inculcating us into why we do it.\n\n1:23:48.920 --> 1:23:50.360\n I mean, I guess that's why it's exciting.\n\n1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:52.480\n You don't know if we're gonna be able to pull this off.\n\n1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:56.280\n Like, we could like fail miserably.\n\n1:23:56.280 --> 1:23:57.760\n And that, I suppose, I mean,\n\n1:23:57.760 --> 1:23:59.960\n that's where the best of engineering is done\n\n1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:02.880\n is like success is not guaranteed.\n\n1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:06.320\n And even if it happens, it might be very painful.\n\n1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:07.200\n I think that's what's so special\n\n1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:08.920\n about what Elon is doing with SpaceX\n\n1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:12.000\n is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively\n\n1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.880\n and he'll, we'll see the spectacular failures\n\n1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.480\n on the path to a successful Starship.\n\n1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:18.720\n It's something that, you know, people have said,\n\n1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:19.960\n why isn't NASA doing that?\n\n1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:22.440\n Well, that's cause NASA is doing that with taxpayer dollars\n\n1:24:22.440 --> 1:24:25.120\n and we would all revolt if we saw NASA failing\n\n1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:26.200\n at all these different stages.\n\n1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:27.600\n But that level of, you know,\n\n1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:30.200\n spiral engineering theory of development\n\n1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:31.560\n isn't super impressive.\n\n1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:32.760\n And it's a really interesting approach\n\n1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:34.360\n that SpaceX has taken.\n\n1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:37.920\n And I think between people like Elon and Jeff Bezos\n\n1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:41.520\n and Firefly and NASA and ESO, we are gonna get there.\n\n1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:43.160\n They're building the road to space.\n\n1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.000\n These trailblazers are doing it.\n\n1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.760\n And now part of the challenge is to get the rest\n\n1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.000\n of the public to understand that it's happening, right?\n\n1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.600\n A lot of people don't know that we're going back\n\n1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.400\n to the moon, that we're gonna send the first woman\n\n1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:57.720\n to the moon within a few years.\n\n1:24:57.720 --> 1:24:58.640\n A lot of people don't know\n\n1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:00.680\n that there are commercial space stations in orbit,\n\n1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:03.320\n that it's not just NASA that does space stuff.\n\n1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:07.040\n So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity excited\n\n1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:08.480\n and educated and involved again,\n\n1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:09.840\n kind of like in the Apollo era\n\n1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:12.360\n where it was a big deal for everybody.\n\n1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:15.120\n Well, a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things\n\n1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:18.560\n that Elon does, I think, extremely well\n\n1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:21.280\n is the social media, is the getting people excited.\n\n1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:24.200\n And I think that actually, he's helped NASA\n\n1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:26.520\n step their game up in terms of social media.\n\n1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:28.680\n There's something about, yeah, the storytelling,\n\n1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:33.680\n but also not like, you know, like authentic\n\n1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.200\n and just real and raw engineering.\n\n1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:40.520\n There's a lot of excitement for that humor and fun also.\n\n1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:42.560\n All of those things you realize,\n\n1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:46.080\n the thing that make up the virality of the meme\n\n1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:48.680\n is beautiful, you have to kind of embrace that.\n\n1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:52.280\n And to me, this kind of,\n\n1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.200\n I criticize a lot of companies based on this.\n\n1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:59.320\n I talked to a bunch of CEOs and so on,\n\n1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:01.000\n and it's just like, there's a caution,\n\n1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.600\n like let us do this like press conference thing\n\n1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:06.760\n where when the final product is ready\n\n1:26:06.760 --> 1:26:08.160\n and it's overproduced,\n\n1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:11.520\n as opposed to the raw, the gritty just showed off.\n\n1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:14.000\n I mean, something that I think MIT is very good at doing\n\n1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.560\n is just showing the raw, by nature, the mess of it.\n\n1:26:17.560 --> 1:26:18.920\n And the mess of it is beautiful\n\n1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:21.760\n and people get really excited and failure is really exciting.\n\n1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:23.920\n When the thing blows up and you're like, oh shit,\n\n1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:27.080\n that makes it even more exciting when it doesn't blow up.\n\n1:26:27.080 --> 1:26:29.040\n And doing all of that on social media\n\n1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:31.680\n and showing also the humans behind it,\n\n1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:35.240\n the individual young researchers or the engineers\n\n1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.480\n or the leaders where everything's at stake.\n\n1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:40.840\n I don't know, I think I'm really excited about that.\n\n1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:43.840\n I do want MIT to do that more for students\n\n1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:47.240\n to show off their stuff and not be pressured\n\n1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.080\n to do this kind of generic official presentation,\n\n1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:54.480\n but show their, become a YouTuber also.\n\n1:26:54.480 --> 1:26:55.960\n Like show off your raw research\n\n1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:58.120\n as you're working on it in the early days.\n\n1:26:58.120 --> 1:26:59.480\n I hope that's the future.\n\n1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:02.280\n Things like, I was teasing about TikTok earlier,\n\n1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:07.280\n but these kinds of things I think inspire young people\n\n1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:11.240\n to show off their stuff, to show their true self,\n\n1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:12.080\n the rawness of it,\n\n1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:13.880\n because I think that's where engineering is best.\n\n1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:16.120\n And I think that will inspire people\n\n1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.920\n about all the cool stuff we could do out in space.\n\n1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:20.240\n I should say, I couldn't agree more.\n\n1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:21.920\n And I actually think that this is why we need\n\n1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:24.680\n a real life Starfleet Academy right now.\n\n1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:27.080\n It was the place where the space cadets got to go\n\n1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:31.360\n to learn about how to engage in a future of life in space.\n\n1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:33.840\n And we can do it in a much better way.\n\n1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:35.120\n There are a bunch of groups that traditionally\n\n1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:37.840\n haven't thought that they could engage in aerospace,\n\n1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:38.920\n whether it's because you were told\n\n1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.680\n you had to be into math and science.\n\n1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:42.160\n Now we need space lawyers,\n\n1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:44.240\n we need space artists like Grimes, right?\n\n1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:48.120\n We need really creative, profoundly interesting people\n\n1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:51.560\n to wanna see themselves in that future.\n\n1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:53.200\n And I think it's a big challenge to us\n\n1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:55.440\n in the space industry to also do some more diversity,\n\n1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:56.520\n equity and inclusion,\n\n1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:58.920\n and show a broader swath of society\n\n1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:00.360\n that there's a future for them\n\n1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:01.960\n in this space exploration vision.\n\n1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:03.160\n Let me push back on one thing.\n\n1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:04.480\n We don't need space lawyers.\n\n1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:05.320\n I'm just kidding.\n\n1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:06.680\n Okay, it's a joke.\n\n1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.760\n We do, we do, we do.\n\n1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:09.400\n Okay, we do.\n\n1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:11.400\n The lawyers are great, I love them.\n\n1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:13.840\n Okay, let me ask a big, ridiculous question.\n\n1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:17.120\n What is the most beautiful idea to you\n\n1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:19.200\n about space exploration?\n\n1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:22.560\n Whether it's the engineering, the astrobiology,\n\n1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:27.560\n the science, the inspiration, the human happiness,\n\n1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:30.200\n or aliens, I don't know.\n\n1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:35.200\n What do you, like, inspires you every day\n\n1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:39.560\n in terms of its beauty, in terms of its awe?\n\n1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:43.280\n As a ex physicist, what I've always found so profound\n\n1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.080\n is just that at really, really small scales,\n\n1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:48.320\n like particle physics,\n\n1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:51.520\n and really, really big scales, like astrophysics,\n\n1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:53.360\n there are similarities in the way\n\n1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:55.560\n that those systems behave and look,\n\n1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:59.440\n and there's a certain beautiful symmetry in the universe\n\n1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:01.120\n that's just kind of waiting for us\n\n1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:04.280\n to tie together the physics and really understand it.\n\n1:29:04.280 --> 1:29:07.760\n That is something that just really captivates me,\n\n1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:08.880\n and I would love to,\n\n1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:09.920\n even though I'm now much more\n\n1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:12.480\n on the applied space exploration side,\n\n1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:14.240\n I really try to keep up with what's happening\n\n1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.160\n in those physics areas,\n\n1:29:15.160 --> 1:29:18.360\n because I think that will be a huge answer for humanity\n\n1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:21.500\n along the lines of, are we alone in the universe?\n\n1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:24.200\n One of the fascinating things about you\n\n1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:28.120\n is you have a degree in physics, mathematics,\n\n1:29:28.120 --> 1:29:31.360\n and philosophy, and now, I don't know,\n\n1:29:31.360 --> 1:29:34.280\n would you call it aerospace engineering maybe kind of thing?\n\n1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:36.940\n So you have at a foot in all of these worlds,\n\n1:29:36.940 --> 1:29:41.940\n the theoretic, the beauty of that world,\n\n1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.680\n and the philosophy somehow is in there,\n\n1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:48.380\n and now the very practical, pragmatic implementation\n\n1:29:48.380 --> 1:29:50.880\n of all these wild ideas,\n\n1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.320\n plus your incredible communicator, all of those things.\n\n1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:56.120\n What did you pick up from those different disciplines?\n\n1:29:56.120 --> 1:29:57.540\n Or maybe I'm just romanticizing\n\n1:29:57.540 --> 1:29:59.400\n all those different disciplines,\n\n1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:02.760\n but what did you pick up from the variety\n\n1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:06.200\n of that physics, mathematics, philosophy?\n\n1:30:06.200 --> 1:30:07.880\n What I loved about having this chance\n\n1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:10.120\n to do a liberal arts education\n\n1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:13.400\n was trying to understand the human condition,\n\n1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:16.440\n and I think more designers for space exploration\n\n1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:17.720\n should be thinking about that,\n\n1:30:17.720 --> 1:30:19.800\n because there's so much depth of,\n\n1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:21.200\n like we were talking about,\n\n1:30:21.200 --> 1:30:24.420\n issues and opportunities around human connection,\n\n1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:27.060\n human life, meaning in life.\n\n1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.400\n How do you find fulfillment or happiness?\n\n1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:31.160\n And I think if you approach these questions\n\n1:30:31.160 --> 1:30:33.240\n just purely from the standpoint of an engineer\n\n1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:35.360\n or a scientist, you'll miss some of what\n\n1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:38.240\n makes it a life worth living.\n\n1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:40.360\n And so I love being able to combine\n\n1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:41.760\n some of this notion of philosophy\n\n1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.660\n and the human condition with my work,\n\n1:30:43.660 --> 1:30:45.240\n but I'm also a pragmatist,\n\n1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:47.140\n and I didn't want to stay just purely\n\n1:30:47.140 --> 1:30:49.920\n in these big picture questions about the universe.\n\n1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:52.280\n I wanted to have an impact on society,\n\n1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:55.940\n and I also felt like I had such a wonderful childhood\n\n1:30:55.940 --> 1:31:00.940\n and a really fantastic setup that I owe society some work\n\n1:31:01.360 --> 1:31:04.400\n to really make a positive impact\n\n1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:05.640\n for a broader swath of citizens.\n\n1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:07.820\n And so that kind of led me from the physics domain\n\n1:31:07.820 --> 1:31:10.340\n to thinking about engineering and practical questions\n\n1:31:10.340 --> 1:31:11.240\n for life in space.\n\n1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:13.960\n In physics, was there a dream?\n\n1:31:13.960 --> 1:31:16.120\n Are you also captivated by this search\n\n1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:19.400\n for the theory of everything that kind of unlocks\n\n1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:23.580\n the deeper and deeper, in the simple, elegant way,\n\n1:31:23.580 --> 1:31:25.300\n the function of our universe?\n\n1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:27.160\n Do you think that'll be useful for us\n\n1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:30.360\n for the actual practical engineering things\n\n1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:31.520\n that you're working on now?\n\n1:31:31.520 --> 1:31:32.360\n It could be.\n\n1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:35.200\n I mean, I worked at CERN for two summers in undergrad,\n\n1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:37.560\n and we were looking for supersymmetry,\n\n1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:40.040\n which was one of these alternatives to the standard model.\n\n1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:41.640\n And it was sad because my professors\n\n1:31:41.640 --> 1:31:43.200\n were getting sadder and sadder\n\n1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:44.520\n because they weren't finding it.\n\n1:31:44.520 --> 1:31:47.080\n They were excluding what we would call this parameter space\n\n1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:50.000\n of finding these supersymmetric particles.\n\n1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:53.120\n But the search for what that theory of everything could be,\n\n1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:55.480\n or a grand unified theory that kind of answers\n\n1:31:55.480 --> 1:31:58.360\n some of the holes within the standard model of physics\n\n1:31:58.360 --> 1:32:02.320\n would presumably kind of unlock a better understanding\n\n1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:05.480\n of certain fundamental physical laws\n\n1:32:05.480 --> 1:32:08.000\n that we should be able to build a better understanding\n\n1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.760\n of engineering and day to day services from that.\n\n1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:13.140\n It might not be an immediately obvious thing.\n\n1:32:13.140 --> 1:32:15.160\n When we discovered the Higgs boson,\n\n1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:16.600\n I was there at CERN that day.\n\n1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.840\n It was July 4th, 2012 that it was announced.\n\n1:32:19.840 --> 1:32:22.240\n We all waited like nerds overnight in line\n\n1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:23.800\n to get into the announcement chamber.\n\n1:32:23.800 --> 1:32:25.760\n I'd never waited for even like a Harry Potter premiere\n\n1:32:25.760 --> 1:32:27.760\n in my life, but we waited for this announcement\n\n1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:30.840\n of the Higgs boson to get into the chamber overnight.\n\n1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:33.840\n But did that immediately translate\n\n1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:35.680\n to technology for engineering?\n\n1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:39.200\n No, but it's still a really important part\n\n1:32:39.200 --> 1:32:41.560\n of our understanding of these fundamental laws of physics.\n\n1:32:41.560 --> 1:32:43.160\n And so I don't know that it's always immediate,\n\n1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:44.660\n but I think it is really critical knowledge\n\n1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:46.020\n for humanity to seek.\n\n1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:50.680\n It might just shake up understanding of the world.\n\n1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:52.880\n What scares me is it might help us create\n\n1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:54.160\n more dangerous weapons.\n\n1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:57.680\n So, and then we'll figure out that great filter situation.\n\n1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:00.800\n And I still believe that human compassion and love\n\n1:33:02.120 --> 1:33:04.280\n is actually the way to defend against all these greater\n\n1:33:04.280 --> 1:33:07.740\n and greater and more impressive weapons.\n\n1:33:07.740 --> 1:33:10.600\n Let me ask a weird question in terms\n\n1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:12.520\n of you disagreeing with others.\n\n1:33:12.520 --> 1:33:15.640\n What important idea do you believe is true\n\n1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:20.400\n that many others don't agree with you on?\n\n1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:22.160\n Maybe, it's a tough question.\n\n1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:23.800\n You might have to think about that one,\n\n1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:26.320\n but whether it's very specific,\n\n1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:28.800\n like which material to use or something\n\n1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:30.680\n about a particular project,\n\n1:33:30.680 --> 1:33:35.200\n or it could be grand priorities on missions.\n\n1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:36.920\n I think one you actually mentioned is interesting\n\n1:33:36.920 --> 1:33:40.640\n is like the thing we should be looking for\n\n1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:43.000\n is like colonization of space\n\n1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.040\n versus colonization of planets.\n\n1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:45.880\n Meaning like.\n\n1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:47.540\n Yes, it's probably my best hot take\n\n1:33:47.540 --> 1:33:49.080\n that people would disagree with me on\n\n1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:51.840\n is life in floating cities\n\n1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:54.840\n as opposed to life on the surface.\n\n1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:58.320\n How do you envision that like spread of humans?\n\n1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:00.720\n Cause you said at the beginning of the conversation,\n\n1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:03.760\n something about like scale, increasing the scale\n\n1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:05.560\n of basically humans in space.\n\n1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:09.480\n Are they just like in, they're in orbit\n\n1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:11.640\n and then they get a little farther and farther out.\n\n1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:15.760\n Like, do you see this kind of floating cities\n\n1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:17.460\n just getting farther and farther from earth?\n\n1:34:17.460 --> 1:34:18.960\n They can always kind of return,\n\n1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:22.000\n but like if you look a few centuries from now,\n\n1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.240\n do you just see us, all these like floating cities.\n\n1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:25.080\n Like Amoeba.\n\n1:34:25.080 --> 1:34:25.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:30.640\n And it just kind of envelops the space around us\n\n1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:31.920\n in these like neighborhoods.\n\n1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:32.760\n Yeah, in these neighborhoods.\n\n1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:36.760\n It's like rural and there's like giant structures\n\n1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:38.960\n and there's small pirate structures\n\n1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:39.800\n and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:40.620\n Pirate structures, yeah.\n\n1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:43.400\n I think low earth orbit might come to look like that.\n\n1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:45.680\n And it's a really interesting regulatory challenge\n\n1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:49.200\n to make sure that there's some cross purposes.\n\n1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:51.620\n So the more cool space cities we have in orbit,\n\n1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:53.800\n the more shiny objects in the night sky,\n\n1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:55.320\n the worse it is for astronomers\n\n1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:58.080\n in a really kind of overly simplified case.\n\n1:34:58.080 --> 1:35:00.840\n So there's some pushback to this like Amoebaing\n\n1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:05.080\n where we just grow kind of incongruously\n\n1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:08.000\n or indiscriminately as an Amoeba in low earth orbit.\n\n1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.640\n Beyond that though, I think we'll grow in pockets\n\n1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:12.200\n where there are resources.\n\n1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:15.840\n So we won't just expand around the gravity well of earth.\n\n1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:18.600\n We'll do some development around the moon,\n\n1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:20.200\n some development around asteroids,\n\n1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:21.760\n some development around Mars,\n\n1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:23.300\n because there'll always be purposes\n\n1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:25.480\n for which we wanna go down to a physical object\n\n1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:28.460\n and study it or extract something or learn from it.\n\n1:35:28.460 --> 1:35:32.000\n But I think we'll grow in fits and starts in pockets.\n\n1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.140\n Some of the coolest pockets are the gravity balanced pockets\n\n1:35:35.140 --> 1:35:37.800\n like the Lagrange points, which is where we just sent,\n\n1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:41.440\n we not me personally, but NASA just sent James Webb,\n\n1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:44.000\n the big telescope, I think it's at L2.\n\n1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:44.840\n So.\n\n1:35:44.840 --> 1:35:46.480\n What's the nice feature about those pockets?\n\n1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.480\n So it's a stable orbit.\n\n1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:50.520\n There are several different Lagrange points.\n\n1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:52.400\n And so it just requires less energy\n\n1:35:52.400 --> 1:35:55.200\n to stay where you're trying to stay.\n\n1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:57.480\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:59.840\n What's also fascinating is the interaction\n\n1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.440\n between nations on that regard.\n\n1:36:04.440 --> 1:36:06.480\n Like who owns that?\n\n1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:09.200\n Would you say in those floating cities,\n\n1:36:09.200 --> 1:36:13.080\n do you envision independent governments?\n\n1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:14.520\n That was gonna be my next answer to you,\n\n1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:17.480\n which pushed me harder for a more provocative question\n\n1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:19.320\n where I might disagree with other people.\n\n1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:22.720\n I don't yet have my own opinions fully formed on this,\n\n1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:24.280\n but we are trying to figure out right now\n\n1:36:24.280 --> 1:36:25.840\n what happens to the moon\n\n1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:29.820\n with all of these first come first served actors\n\n1:36:29.820 --> 1:36:32.360\n just arriving and setting precedents\n\n1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.480\n that might really affect future access.\n\n1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:37.260\n And one example is property rights.\n\n1:36:37.260 --> 1:36:40.080\n We do want companies that have the expertise\n\n1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:41.880\n to go to the moon and mine stuff\n\n1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:45.960\n that will help us develop a human settlement there\n\n1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:49.200\n or a gateway, but companies need to know generally\n\n1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:50.800\n that they have rights to a certain area\n\n1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:52.900\n or that they have some legal right to sell things\n\n1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:53.740\n that they're getting.\n\n1:36:53.740 --> 1:36:55.760\n Does that mean we're gonna grant property rights\n\n1:36:55.760 --> 1:36:58.760\n on the moon to companies who has the right\n\n1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:00.720\n to give that right away?\n\n1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:02.760\n So there's a bunch of really kind of gnarly questions\n\n1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:03.580\n that we have to think about,\n\n1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:04.920\n which is why I think we need space lawyers.\n\n1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:07.600\n Maybe that's the true provocative answers.\n\n1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:09.040\n I think we need space lawyers.\n\n1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:12.020\n I mean, yeah, yeah, I mean, but those questions,\n\n1:37:12.020 --> 1:37:14.580\n again, as you said eloquently,\n\n1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:17.120\n will help us answer questions about here on Earth.\n\n1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:18.240\n We hope so, yeah.\n\n1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:20.920\n It is a little strange.\n\n1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:23.100\n I mean, it's obvious, but it's also strange\n\n1:37:23.100 --> 1:37:25.640\n if you look at the big picture of it all\n\n1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:28.940\n that we draw these like borders around geographical areas\n\n1:37:28.940 --> 1:37:32.120\n and we say, this is mine, like,\n\n1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:34.160\n and then we fight wars over what's mine\n\n1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:39.160\n and not, it seems like there's possible alternatives,\n\n1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:42.920\n but also it seems like there needs to be a public ownership\n\n1:37:42.920 --> 1:37:45.880\n of some parts, like, what is it?\n\n1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:47.280\n Central Park in New York.\n\n1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:50.460\n Is there something like preserving?\n\n1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:52.400\n The commons.\n\n1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:53.240\n Yeah, the commons.\n\n1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:54.080\n The commons.\n\n1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:57.320\n That's why we titled the book Into the Anthropocosmos.\n\n1:37:57.320 --> 1:37:59.680\n We know it's a long and kind of a mouthful,\n\n1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:02.360\n but this notion of the Anthropocene,\n\n1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:04.900\n we have a lot of commons problems in humanity.\n\n1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:07.000\n How are we treating the Earth, global climate change?\n\n1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.180\n How are we gonna treat and behave in space?\n\n1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:12.880\n How can we be responsible stewards of the space commons?\n\n1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:15.120\n And I would love to see an approach to the moon\n\n1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:18.340\n that is commons based, but it's hard to know\n\n1:38:18.340 --> 1:38:21.960\n who would be the protector or the enforcer of that.\n\n1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:25.120\n And if it's, which it will be probably in the early days,\n\n1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:28.080\n a lot of companies sort of working on the moon,\n\n1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:30.840\n working on Mars, working out in space,\n\n1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:33.080\n it feels like there still needs to be\n\n1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.400\n a civilian representation of like the greater effort\n\n1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:38.680\n or something like that.\n\n1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:40.160\n Like where there should be a president,\n\n1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.840\n there should be a democracy of some kind\n\n1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:43.880\n where people can vote.\n\n1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.320\n Some representative government.\n\n1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:49.200\n Those are all, again, the same human questions.\n\n1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:54.000\n What advice would you give to a young person today\n\n1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:57.840\n thinking about what they wanna do with their life, career?\n\n1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:01.540\n So somebody in high school, somebody in college,\n\n1:39:01.540 --> 1:39:03.300\n maybe somebody that looks up to the stars\n\n1:39:03.300 --> 1:39:07.120\n and dreams to one day, take a one way ticket to Mars\n\n1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:09.900\n or to contribute something to the effort.\n\n1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:12.800\n I'd say you should feel empowered\n\n1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:16.080\n because it's really the first time in human history\n\n1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:19.940\n that we're at this cusp of interplanetary civilization.\n\n1:39:19.940 --> 1:39:22.240\n And I don't think we're gonna lapse back from it.\n\n1:39:22.240 --> 1:39:25.200\n So the future is incredibly bright for young people\n\n1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:26.680\n that even younger than you and I,\n\n1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.560\n who will actually really get a chance to go to Mars\n\n1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:29.400\n for certain.\n\n1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:32.800\n The other thing I would say is be open minded\n\n1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.360\n about what your own interests are.\n\n1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.480\n I don't think you anymore have to be shoehorned\n\n1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:39.200\n into a particular career to be welcomed\n\n1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:41.320\n into the future of space exploration.\n\n1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:43.800\n If you are an artist and that is your passion,\n\n1:39:43.800 --> 1:39:47.400\n but you would love to do space art or if not space art,\n\n1:39:47.400 --> 1:39:49.920\n use your artistry to communicate a feeling\n\n1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.880\n or a message about space.\n\n1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:54.400\n That's a role that we desperately need\n\n1:39:54.400 --> 1:39:56.080\n just as much as we need space scientists\n\n1:39:56.080 --> 1:39:57.880\n and space engineers, so.\n\n1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:00.200\n Well, when you look at your own life,\n\n1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:02.800\n you're an incredibly accomplished scientist,\n\n1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:05.000\n young scientist, but you know,\n\n1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.960\n and you hopped around from physics to aerospace.\n\n1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:11.640\n So going from the biggest theoretical ideas\n\n1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:14.280\n to the biggest practical ideas.\n\n1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:15.760\n Is there something from your own journey\n\n1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:17.720\n you can give advice to,\n\n1:40:17.720 --> 1:40:22.320\n like how to end up doing incredible research at MIT?\n\n1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:26.680\n Maybe the role of the university and college\n\n1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:29.440\n and education and learning, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.120\n I'd say one piece of advice is find really good teammates\n\n1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:35.280\n because I get to be the one that's talking to you,\n\n1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:38.920\n but there are 50 graduate students, staff and faculty\n\n1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:41.640\n that are part of my organization back at MIT.\n\n1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:43.160\n And I'm actually, you guys can't see it on camera,\n\n1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:45.560\n but I'm sitting here with my co founder and COO,\n\n1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:48.920\n Danielle DeLotte, and that is really what makes\n\n1:40:48.920 --> 1:40:52.560\n these large scale challenges for humanity possible\n\n1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:55.120\n is really fantastic teams working together\n\n1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:57.360\n to scale more than what I could do alone.\n\n1:40:57.360 --> 1:40:58.600\n So I think that that's an important model\n\n1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:00.360\n that we don't talk about enough in academia.\n\n1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:03.680\n There's a big push for this like lone wolf genius figure\n\n1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:06.000\n in academia, but that's certainly not been the case\n\n1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:06.840\n in my life.\n\n1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:09.440\n I've had wonderful collaborators and people\n\n1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:10.680\n that I work with along the team.\n\n1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.560\n Also cross disciplinary.\n\n1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:13.680\n Absolutely, yeah.\n\n1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:15.320\n Cross disciplinary, interdisciplinary,\n\n1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:17.240\n whatever you wanna call it, but.\n\n1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:19.280\n Artists, where do artists come in?\n\n1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:20.200\n Do you work with artists?\n\n1:41:20.200 --> 1:41:21.040\n We do.\n\n1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:22.120\n We have an arts curator\n\n1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.160\n on the space exploration initiative side.\n\n1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:26.560\n She helps make sure partly around that communication\n\n1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:27.600\n challenge that we talked about,\n\n1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.560\n that we're not just doing zero G flights\n\n1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:32.720\n and space missions, but that we take our artifacts\n\n1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:35.440\n of this sci fi space future to museums\n\n1:41:35.440 --> 1:41:38.000\n and galleries and exhibits.\n\n1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.760\n She pushed me to make sure her name is Shinglu.\n\n1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:44.440\n She pushed me for our first ISS mission.\n\n1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:46.720\n I was just gathering all the engineering payloads\n\n1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:48.600\n that I wanted to support for the students to fly,\n\n1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:49.800\n including my own work.\n\n1:41:49.800 --> 1:41:50.640\n And she said, you know what?\n\n1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:52.920\n We should do an open call internationally\n\n1:41:52.920 --> 1:41:55.920\n for artists to send something to the ISS.\n\n1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:57.760\n And we found out it was the first time.\n\n1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:00.120\n We were the first ever international open call\n\n1:42:00.120 --> 1:42:01.840\n for art to go to the ISS.\n\n1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:04.080\n And that was thanks to Shing, an artist bringing\n\n1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:05.520\n a perspective that I might not have thought\n\n1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:08.000\n about prioritizing, so.\n\n1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.040\n Yeah, that's awesome.\n\n1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:11.080\n So when you look out there,\n\n1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:12.920\n it's the flame of human consciousness.\n\n1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:15.040\n There does seem to be something quite special\n\n1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:16.760\n about us humans.\n\n1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:21.760\n Well, first of all, what do you think it is?\n\n1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:23.000\n What's consciousness?\n\n1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.840\n What are we trying to preserve here?\n\n1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:32.080\n What is it about humans that should be preserved\n\n1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:33.880\n or life here on earth?\n\n1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:37.880\n What gives you hope to try to expand it out\n\n1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:38.960\n farther and farther?\n\n1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.140\n Like, what makes you sad if it was all gone?\n\n1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:46.180\n I think we're a remarkable species\n\n1:42:46.180 --> 1:42:49.820\n that we are aware of our own thoughts.\n\n1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:52.060\n We are meta aware of our own thoughts\n\n1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:52.900\n and of ourselves.\n\n1:42:52.900 --> 1:42:54.580\n And we're able to speak on a podcast\n\n1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:56.940\n about our meta awareness, about our own thoughts.\n\n1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:58.020\n About our own thoughts, yeah.\n\n1:42:58.020 --> 1:42:59.220\n Turtles all the way down.\n\n1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:03.140\n I think that that is a really special gift\n\n1:43:03.140 --> 1:43:04.740\n that we have been given as a species\n\n1:43:04.740 --> 1:43:07.660\n and that there's a worth to expanding\n\n1:43:07.660 --> 1:43:09.540\n our circles of awareness.\n\n1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:12.140\n So we're very aware of, as an earth based species,\n\n1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:13.700\n we've become a little bit more aware\n\n1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:15.980\n of the fragility of earth and how special a place it is\n\n1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:18.100\n when we go to the moon and we look back.\n\n1:43:18.100 --> 1:43:21.940\n What would it mean for us to have a presence\n\n1:43:21.940 --> 1:43:26.180\n and our purpose in life as a inter solar system species\n\n1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:28.540\n or eventually an intergalactic species?\n\n1:43:28.540 --> 1:43:30.160\n I think it's a really profound opportunity\n\n1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:34.500\n for exploration, for the sake of exploration.\n\n1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:36.300\n A real gift for the human mind.\n\n1:43:36.300 --> 1:43:41.020\n Yeah, for anything, we're curious creatures.\n\n1:43:41.020 --> 1:43:43.220\n You see, you do believe we might one day\n\n1:43:43.220 --> 1:43:46.340\n become intergalactic civilizations.\n\n1:43:46.340 --> 1:43:47.700\n Long, long time from now.\n\n1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:49.980\n We have a lot of propulsion challenges\n\n1:43:49.980 --> 1:43:51.500\n to answer to get that far.\n\n1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:53.140\n So you have a hope for this.\n\n1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:54.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:54.740 --> 1:43:57.580\n Another big ridiculous question building on top of that.\n\n1:43:57.580 --> 1:44:00.220\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:03.820\n This individual life of ours, your life,\n\n1:44:03.820 --> 1:44:06.300\n that unfortunately has to come to an end\n\n1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.060\n as far as we know for now.\n\n1:44:08.060 --> 1:44:09.180\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:09.180 --> 1:44:13.900\n And our life here together, is there a why?\n\n1:44:13.900 --> 1:44:18.900\n Or do we just kinda like let our curiosity carry us away?\n\n1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:21.580\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:25.380\n Is there a single kind of driving purpose why\n\n1:44:25.380 --> 1:44:28.020\n or can it just be curiosity based?\n\n1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.700\n I certainly feel, and this is not the scientist\n\n1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:34.080\n in me talking, but just more of like a human soul talking.\n\n1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:38.420\n I certainly feel some sense of purpose\n\n1:44:38.420 --> 1:44:39.580\n and meaning in my life.\n\n1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:40.580\n And there's a version of that\n\n1:44:40.580 --> 1:44:43.340\n that's a very local level within my family,\n\n1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:44.860\n which is funny because this whole conversation\n\n1:44:44.860 --> 1:44:47.060\n has been big, grand space exploration themes.\n\n1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:48.140\n But you asked me this question\n\n1:44:48.140 --> 1:44:50.060\n and my first thought is what really matters to me,\n\n1:44:50.060 --> 1:44:53.480\n my family, my biological reproducing unit.\n\n1:44:53.480 --> 1:44:57.900\n But then there's also another purpose,\n\n1:44:57.900 --> 1:44:59.780\n like another version of the meaning in my life\n\n1:44:59.780 --> 1:45:02.420\n that is trying to do good things for humanity.\n\n1:45:02.420 --> 1:45:04.980\n So that sense that we can be individual humans\n\n1:45:04.980 --> 1:45:06.740\n and have our local meaning,\n\n1:45:06.740 --> 1:45:08.620\n and we can also be global humans.\n\n1:45:08.620 --> 1:45:10.500\n Maybe someday like the Star Trek utopia\n\n1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:12.460\n will all be global citizens.\n\n1:45:12.460 --> 1:45:14.440\n I don't wanna sound too naive.\n\n1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:17.260\n But there is I think that beauty to a meaning\n\n1:45:17.260 --> 1:45:20.100\n and a purpose of your life that's bigger than yourself,\n\n1:45:20.100 --> 1:45:21.960\n working on something that's bigger and grander\n\n1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:23.640\n than just yourself.\n\n1:45:23.640 --> 1:45:25.140\n The deepest meaning is from\n\n1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:28.020\n the local biological reproduction unit.\n\n1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.260\n And then it goes to the engineering scientific,\n\n1:45:32.140 --> 1:45:35.240\n what is it, corporate like company unit\n\n1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:37.380\n that can actually produce and compete\n\n1:45:37.380 --> 1:45:38.620\n and interact with the world.\n\n1:45:38.620 --> 1:45:41.340\n And then there's the giant human unit\n\n1:45:41.340 --> 1:45:43.980\n that's struggling with pandemics.\n\n1:45:43.980 --> 1:45:45.180\n And commons.\n\n1:45:45.180 --> 1:45:49.220\n And together struggling against the forces of nature\n\n1:45:49.220 --> 1:45:50.820\n that keeps wanting to kill us.\n\n1:45:50.820 --> 1:45:52.920\n Yeah,
