and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,\n\n00:08.380 --> 00:12.600\n the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:17.000\n You expect to have a full day of battery life,\n\n00:17.000 --> 00:20.320\n but then you want it to not be sending data\n\n00:20.320 --> 00:23.240\n into 10 or 100 megabits.\n\n00:23.240 --> 00:24.800\n You want gigabits.\n\n00:24.800 --> 00:28.080\n You want it to be able to have eight core processors.\n\n00:28.080 --> 00:30.720\n You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.\n\n00:30.720 --> 00:32.600\n You want to have all of those things\n\n00:32.600 --> 00:37.600\n that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.\n\n00:37.880 --> 00:41.160\n To do all of that in your phone is an incredible thing.\n\n00:41.160 --> 00:44.060\n Some people raise concerns about there not being enough\n\n00:44.060 --> 00:47.560\n studies about the effects of 5G on the human body.\n\n00:47.560 --> 00:48.960\n Is 5G safe?\n\n00:51.920 --> 00:55.040\n The following is a conversation with Cristiano Aman,\n\n00:55.040 --> 00:57.200\n the CEO of Qualcomm.\n\n00:57.200 --> 00:59.780\n The company that's one of the leaders in the world\n\n00:59.780 --> 01:03.120\n in the space of mobile communication and computation.\n\n01:03.120 --> 01:08.120\n That's 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G that connects billions of phones,\n\n01:08.300 --> 01:12.280\n and the Snapdragon processor and system on a chip\n\n01:12.280 --> 01:15.320\n that is the brain of most of the premium Android phones\n\n01:15.320 --> 01:16.700\n in the world.\n\n01:16.700 --> 01:18.720\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:18.720 --> 01:20.600\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:20.600 --> 01:21.800\n in the description.\n\n01:21.800 --> 01:25.780\n And now, dear friends, here's Cristiano Aman.\n\n01:25.780 --> 01:28.540\n You are originally from Brazil,\n\n01:28.540 --> 01:31.340\n so let me ask the most important question,\n\n01:31.340 --> 01:33.260\n the most profound question, the biggest question.\n\n01:33.260 --> 01:36.620\n Who's the greatest football soccer player of all time?\n\n01:36.620 --> 01:38.540\n Look, everybody's gonna say Pele,\n\n01:38.540 --> 01:42.500\n and actually I was born during the game\n\n01:42.500 --> 01:47.500\n of Brazil and Italy that Pele gave Brazil the championship.\n\n01:47.940 --> 01:52.060\n Actually it was, my dad tells me that the doctor\n\n01:52.060 --> 01:54.980\n had a TV on at the delivery room.\n\n01:54.980 --> 01:56.660\n But, so everybody will say Pele,\n\n01:56.660 --> 01:58.600\n but I really like Ronaldo.\n\n01:58.600 --> 02:01.780\n The first, not Ronaldinho, the first Ronaldo.\n\n02:01.780 --> 02:02.900\n I really like him.\n\n02:02.900 --> 02:04.460\n That's my favorite player.\n\n02:04.460 --> 02:07.220\n By the way, not everybody would say Pele.\n\n02:07.220 --> 02:09.700\n But we shall leave that on the table\n\n02:09.700 --> 02:11.460\n and agree to disagree.\n\n02:11.460 --> 02:12.700\n Brazilians will say Pele.\n\n02:12.700 --> 02:13.540\n Yes.\n\n02:14.420 --> 02:17.740\n There's other countries around that region\n\n02:17.740 --> 02:19.140\n that may disagree a little bit.\n\n02:19.140 --> 02:19.980\n I'm very aware.\n\n02:19.980 --> 02:24.980\n Qualcomm is largely responsible for 5G\n\n02:25.300 --> 02:28.060\n and some of the greatest processors\n\n02:28.060 --> 02:29.780\n in our smartphones ever built.\n\n02:29.780 --> 02:33.420\n So we got communication and computation tech\n\n02:33.420 --> 02:36.800\n that impacts probably billions of people.\n\n02:36.800 --> 02:39.420\n So if you zoom out, you as a human,\n\n02:39.420 --> 02:41.420\n we'll look at humans on Earth in general,\n\n02:42.940 --> 02:47.580\n does it blow your mind that we have these billions\n\n02:47.580 --> 02:50.980\n of smartphones communicating and each of them\n\n02:50.980 --> 02:53.260\n have the computational power?\n\n02:53.260 --> 02:56.100\n You know, you talk about 10 billion transistors.\n\n02:56.100 --> 02:59.780\n That's a million times more than 50 years ago\n\n02:59.780 --> 03:01.380\n in the best computers in the world.\n\n03:01.380 --> 03:04.400\n Like if you just zoom out as a human,\n\n03:05.260 --> 03:06.300\n does that blow your mind?\n\n03:06.300 --> 03:07.420\n Absolutely.\n\n03:07.420 --> 03:10.340\n Look, one of the reasons I think I love this company\n\n03:10.340 --> 03:13.660\n is we know that the technology we develop\n\n03:13.660 --> 03:14.500\n can change the world.\n\n03:14.500 --> 03:15.740\n And I'll tell you one more thing.\n\n03:15.740 --> 03:18.260\n Beyond the amount of processing power\n\n03:18.260 --> 03:20.260\n that you have now in the palm of your hands\n\n03:20.260 --> 03:22.580\n and being every one of the world is connected\n\n03:22.580 --> 03:24.460\n with broadband technology,\n\n03:24.460 --> 03:28.020\n the smartphone is also mankind largest development platform.\n\n03:28.020 --> 03:29.620\n There's nothing like it.\n\n03:29.620 --> 03:31.980\n So you respect both the hardware and the software?\n\n03:31.980 --> 03:33.020\n Both.\n\n03:33.020 --> 03:33.840\n Both.\n\n03:33.840 --> 03:36.900\n If aliens were observing Earth over the past 50 to 70 years,\n\n03:36.900 --> 03:38.540\n how do you think they would describe\n\n03:38.540 --> 03:43.540\n this particular turmoil, fun things going on\n\n03:43.540 --> 03:47.900\n on the surface of this particular little planet?\n\n03:47.900 --> 03:49.540\n We live in interesting times.\n\n03:50.820 --> 03:55.460\n In one time, we see incredible development of technology\n\n03:55.460 --> 03:59.340\n for mankind just what happened in the last century.\n\n03:59.340 --> 04:04.340\n You know, from 1900 to 2000, it was incredible development.\n\n04:04.420 --> 04:07.700\n Just look, 2000 was 22 years ago,\n\n04:07.700 --> 04:10.580\n how far we're coming and where we're going with technology.\n\n04:10.580 --> 04:11.900\n It's incredible.\n\n04:11.900 --> 04:13.540\n What do you think they would notice?\n\n04:13.540 --> 04:16.540\n So there's road networks, there's all kinds of networks.\n\n04:16.540 --> 04:19.300\n There's lights that keep popping up,\n\n04:19.300 --> 04:21.860\n cities springing up, like from an alien perspective,\n\n04:21.860 --> 04:22.700\n you're observing.\n\n04:22.700 --> 04:24.900\n Well, what I'm gonna tell you is you have this contrast\n\n04:24.900 --> 04:27.620\n of incredible development of technology,\n\n04:27.620 --> 04:28.940\n but then you see some of the things\n\n04:28.940 --> 04:30.420\n that are happening right now,\n\n04:30.420 --> 04:33.660\n which is probably you would not expect them to happen\n\n04:33.660 --> 04:36.860\n on the 21st century, just what happened in Ukraine.\n\n04:36.860 --> 04:40.300\n So I think that will be a more puzzling question\n\n04:40.300 --> 04:42.500\n for the aliens, I would imagine.\n\n04:42.500 --> 04:44.900\n The new technology is kind of impressive.\n\n04:44.900 --> 04:46.460\n Actually, that might not be so puzzling\n\n04:46.460 --> 04:49.020\n because that's just human nature revealing itself\n\n04:49.020 --> 04:50.620\n as it has throughout human history.\n\n04:50.620 --> 04:51.460\n That's correct.\n\n04:52.780 --> 04:54.860\n Let's talk about wireless communication.\n\n04:54.860 --> 04:58.540\n So Qualcomm was instrumental in developing 5G.\n\n04:58.540 --> 05:01.100\n Now you were with Qualcomm since the early days,\n\n05:01.100 --> 05:05.580\n the good old 90s with the 2G, but what is 5G,\n\n05:05.580 --> 05:10.100\n including sub six gigahertz 5G and millimeter wave 5G?\n\n05:10.100 --> 05:10.940\n How does it work?\n\n05:10.940 --> 05:13.340\n And maybe the most important question is\n\n05:13.340 --> 05:15.900\n how will it change the world in the coming years?\n\n05:15.900 --> 05:18.300\n When we set ourselves to develop 5G,\n\n05:18.300 --> 05:21.980\n and we look at this, every generation of technology\n\n05:21.980 --> 05:24.180\n had a problem to be solved, right?\n\n05:24.180 --> 05:26.580\n So you mentioned 2G, 2G challenge,\n\n05:26.580 --> 05:29.340\n the challenge of CDMA was can we give every person\n\n05:29.340 --> 05:30.900\n on earth a cell phone?\n\n05:30.900 --> 05:33.060\n That was, can you get to a technology\n\n05:33.060 --> 05:36.100\n that you can basically allow everyone\n\n05:36.100 --> 05:37.660\n to have a mobile phone?\n\n05:37.660 --> 05:41.100\n 3G was about the ability to connect that to the internet.\n\n05:41.100 --> 05:45.140\n I think 4G was broadband and with 4G was about\n\n05:45.140 --> 05:46.780\n have the ability for you to have a computer\n\n05:46.780 --> 05:48.020\n in the palm of your hand.\n\n05:48.020 --> 05:49.540\n We'll just talk about that.\n\n05:49.540 --> 05:52.180\n 5G, the challenge was a little bit different.\n\n05:52.180 --> 05:55.140\n It's how do we build a technology for a society\n\n05:55.140 --> 05:57.980\n that is gonna be 100% connected to the cloud?\n\n05:57.980 --> 06:00.900\n How do we provide a technology that is going to be\n\n06:00.900 --> 06:04.260\n the last mile connectivity for everything?\n\n06:04.260 --> 06:07.980\n So 5G has basically been designed,\n\n06:07.980 --> 06:10.300\n eliminate all issues with data congestion,\n\n06:10.300 --> 06:14.500\n whether you are in stadium, we talk about soccer,\n\n06:14.500 --> 06:16.900\n you were in a stadium and everyone should be\n\n06:16.900 --> 06:19.340\n ability to have access to broadband.\n\n06:19.340 --> 06:20.900\n So deal with congestion.\n\n06:20.900 --> 06:22.900\n Deal with the fact that not only people,\n\n06:22.900 --> 06:25.980\n but billions of things need to be connected.\n\n06:25.980 --> 06:29.780\n Create a technology that for the first time in wireless,\n\n06:29.780 --> 06:32.980\n you could deliver mission critical services.\n\n06:32.980 --> 06:37.180\n Wireless used to up to 4G is its best effort.\n\n06:37.180 --> 06:40.500\n In 5G, it can guarantee that you are connected\n\n06:40.500 --> 06:41.340\n with the cloud.\n\n06:41.340 --> 06:46.340\n And then the last point of that is provide this fabric\n\n06:47.260 --> 06:50.660\n that will allow us as a society to look at things\n\n06:50.660 --> 06:53.260\n that are not connected and say, that's the exception.\n\n06:53.260 --> 06:57.100\n That's why we made a comparison in the early days of 5G\n\n06:57.100 --> 06:58.580\n that that's gonna be like electricity.\n\n06:58.580 --> 07:00.940\n Right now, you don't have a discussion\n\n07:00.940 --> 07:03.300\n about what is the use cases for electricity.\n\n07:03.300 --> 07:04.700\n You don't talk about that anymore.\n\n07:04.700 --> 07:05.860\n You just assume it's there.\n\n07:05.860 --> 07:08.100\n And that's how we think about everything\n\n07:08.100 --> 07:09.420\n connected to the cloud.\n\n07:09.420 --> 07:12.260\n That's what 5G is and that's the role of 5G.\n\n07:13.100 --> 07:15.380\n So first of all, everything connected to the cloud\n\n07:15.380 --> 07:17.540\n is interesting because the space of everything\n\n07:17.540 --> 07:19.020\n is constantly increasing.\n\n07:19.020 --> 07:20.540\n That is correct.\n\n07:20.540 --> 07:22.700\n I don't think the refrigerator over there,\n\n07:22.700 --> 07:23.540\n it looks kind of smart,\n\n07:23.540 --> 07:27.020\n but I don't think it's connected yet to the cloud.\n\n07:27.020 --> 07:29.500\n So this includes internet of things.\n\n07:29.500 --> 07:31.620\n What is the full space of everything?\n\n07:31.620 --> 07:33.860\n The full space of everything is,\n\n07:33.860 --> 07:38.500\n it's maybe going back to where you start defining Qualcomm.\n\n07:38.500 --> 07:41.900\n Qualcomm is about communications and advanced computers\n\n07:41.900 --> 07:43.820\n for low power devices.\n\n07:43.820 --> 07:46.620\n And can we make everything smart?\n\n07:46.620 --> 07:51.140\n It can range from the robot you have right now on the floor\n\n07:51.140 --> 07:54.740\n to your refrigerator, to a camera,\n\n07:54.740 --> 07:59.740\n to machines in manufacturing,\n\n08:00.980 --> 08:03.500\n to retail, et cetera.\n\n08:03.500 --> 08:05.460\n I can give you some examples.\n\n08:05.460 --> 08:08.260\n When we think of something as simple\n\n08:08.260 --> 08:11.260\n as going to the grocery shop,\n\n08:11.260 --> 08:14.540\n we see technology now with something,\n\n08:14.540 --> 08:17.620\n the stuff we've been working with companies like Walmart.\n\n08:17.620 --> 08:19.540\n Electronic shelf labels.\n\n08:19.540 --> 08:21.620\n The ability for you to have smart cameras,\n\n08:21.620 --> 08:24.380\n they can look at shelves and the camera is smart enough\n\n08:24.380 --> 08:27.020\n to say some product needs to be replenished.\n\n08:27.020 --> 08:28.220\n Ability to see what's trashed.\n\n08:28.220 --> 08:32.580\n So it's about really providing processor connectivity,\n\n08:32.580 --> 08:35.300\n artificial intelligence to everything.\n\n08:35.300 --> 08:40.180\n And I think that's one of the largest addressable markets\n\n08:40.180 --> 08:41.180\n we have for technology\n\n08:41.180 --> 08:43.340\n because you can't really define everything.\n\n08:43.340 --> 08:44.260\n Right, exactly.\n\n08:44.260 --> 08:45.100\n It's a nice market\n\n08:45.100 --> 08:48.020\n because it keeps growing potentially exponentially in speed.\n\n08:49.660 --> 08:51.100\n What about coverage?\n\n08:51.100 --> 08:53.180\n So how are we doing on the everything part?\n\n08:53.180 --> 08:57.620\n So there is, like I mentioned, sub six gigahertz 5G\n\n08:57.620 --> 09:00.100\n and there's a millimeter wave 5G.\n\n09:00.100 --> 09:02.780\n So not all 5G is made the same.\n\n09:02.780 --> 09:05.460\n So there's a speed, there's a bandwidth thing.\n\n09:05.460 --> 09:06.780\n And then there's coverage.\n\n09:06.780 --> 09:10.220\n How many people get to enjoy today\n\n09:10.220 --> 09:13.420\n and how does the progress in the next five, 10, 20, 30,\n\n09:13.420 --> 09:15.820\n 50 years you think looks like in terms of coverage?\n\n09:15.820 --> 09:17.060\n Great topic of conversation.\n\n09:17.060 --> 09:18.300\n So let's talk about this.\n\n09:19.180 --> 09:23.020\n When I meet with regulators across the globe,\n\n09:23.020 --> 09:26.140\n I tell them resistance is futile.\n\n09:26.140 --> 09:29.020\n Allocate every spectrum to wireless.\n\n09:29.020 --> 09:31.660\n Every spectrum needs to be allocated to wireless.\n\n09:31.660 --> 09:36.660\n The reality is when we start moving from CDMA to OFDMA,\n\n09:37.500 --> 09:41.820\n we knew that this industry has done a lot\n\n09:41.820 --> 09:44.020\n to get more bits per Hertz.\n\n09:44.020 --> 09:49.020\n But the reality is the massive amount of improvements\n\n09:49.020 --> 09:53.700\n that is required in capacity and in speed,\n\n09:53.700 --> 09:55.380\n you need more spectrum.\n\n09:55.380 --> 10:00.100\n There's not so much we can rely on more bits per Hertz.\n\n10:00.100 --> 10:01.620\n You just need more spectrum.\n\n10:01.620 --> 10:04.300\n And if you look, for example,\n\n10:04.300 --> 10:07.780\n what carriers since the 2G era,\n\n10:07.780 --> 10:10.740\n they participate in different license and auctions\n\n10:10.740 --> 10:15.740\n and every spectrum they accumulated from 2G or 3G or 4G,\n\n10:15.740 --> 10:20.740\n all of that, you may be able to get one or two channels max\n\n10:20.980 --> 10:24.380\n of sub six, which is a channel is about 100 megahertz\n\n10:24.380 --> 10:26.740\n or 200 megahertz, and that's it.\n\n10:26.740 --> 10:28.740\n So we need more spectrum.\n\n10:28.740 --> 10:32.340\n So 5G has been designed to work across every spectrum\n\n10:32.340 --> 10:36.980\n from the low frequency bands, that's what we call the sub six,\n\n10:36.980 --> 10:40.340\n but you needed more, you needed to go to the millimeter wave.\n\n10:40.340 --> 10:43.820\n So that's why 5G is a technology that you can deploy\n\n10:43.820 --> 10:48.820\n from 450 megahertz as an example, or 600 or 700,\n\n10:48.820 --> 10:53.820\n all the way to in the 42 gigahertz.\n\n10:54.100 --> 10:57.180\n And that's where millimeter wave comes into the picture.\n\n10:57.180 --> 11:00.620\n Now, let's now connect this to your question\n\n11:00.620 --> 11:03.580\n about coverage of 5G.\n\n11:03.580 --> 11:08.420\n The easiest thing to do is to deploy 5G\n\n11:08.420 --> 11:10.620\n in the new spectrum you can get,\n\n11:10.620 --> 11:14.180\n which is in the sub six, you see bands being auctioned\n\n11:14.180 --> 11:17.500\n across the globe into 3.5 gigahertz.\n\n11:17.500 --> 11:18.820\n There's nothing special about the band,\n\n11:18.820 --> 11:20.260\n it's just the only one that was available\n\n11:20.260 --> 11:22.620\n because everything else has been useful for 4G.\n\n11:22.620 --> 11:26.620\n And you can deploy on that, go into existing cell towers\n\n11:26.620 --> 11:27.940\n and just put a new equipment\n\n11:27.940 --> 11:29.460\n without having to build new towers.\n\n11:29.460 --> 11:32.700\n But when we go to technologies such as millimeter wave,\n\n11:32.700 --> 11:35.260\n then you have to build more dense networks.\n\n11:35.260 --> 11:37.140\n You need to build more stations\n\n11:37.140 --> 11:38.700\n because a deployment in that case\n\n11:38.700 --> 11:40.500\n look like a wifi deployment,\n\n11:40.500 --> 11:42.900\n it's almost like wifi access points.\n\n11:42.900 --> 11:45.940\n When you need to build more stations, you need permits,\n\n11:45.940 --> 11:50.580\n you need to build fiber, so it takes more time to densify.\n\n11:50.580 --> 11:54.260\n So what you see happening is coverage has been built fast\n\n11:54.260 --> 11:56.620\n with sub six across the globe,\n\n11:56.620 --> 11:59.860\n but now the United States also have the sub six.\n\n11:59.860 --> 12:02.940\n So that gets you to coverage very fast.\n\n12:02.940 --> 12:05.620\n But millimeter wave, it's moving.\n\n12:05.620 --> 12:08.780\n And if I will say, for example, Verizon,\n\n12:08.780 --> 12:11.220\n United States has had a leadership\n\n12:11.220 --> 12:13.060\n in building millimeter wave, it takes time.\n\n12:13.060 --> 12:17.020\n I'll say cities like Chicago, Manhattan\n\n12:17.020 --> 12:18.780\n starting to get coverage.\n\n12:18.780 --> 12:21.540\n It will be a process over a number of years\n\n12:21.540 --> 12:26.220\n as you build those different access points type networks,\n\n12:26.220 --> 12:28.500\n but it's inevitable.\n\n12:28.500 --> 12:30.020\n There's not enough spectrum.\n\n12:30.020 --> 12:33.220\n So every 5G operators just a matter of time\n\n12:33.220 --> 12:35.020\n will have millimeter wave as well.\n\n12:35.020 --> 12:36.740\n Resistance is futile.\n\n12:36.740 --> 12:39.300\n Okay, so for millimeter wave,\n\n12:39.300 --> 12:42.140\n we need density of access points.\n\n12:42.140 --> 12:47.140\n And what's the biggest resistance for Qualcomm\n\n12:47.620 --> 12:49.660\n for human civilization?\n\n12:49.660 --> 12:54.500\n Is it politicians, regulators, federal regulators?\n\n12:54.500 --> 12:57.700\n Is it individual humans?\n\n12:57.700 --> 13:00.620\n Is it not enough money from the consumer perspective?\n\n13:00.620 --> 13:03.340\n Like who is the biggest pain in the butt?\n\n13:03.340 --> 13:05.700\n From a Qualcomm standpoint, but answering the question\n\n13:05.700 --> 13:09.420\n about what it takes to build all this technology.\n\n13:09.420 --> 13:11.740\n I think regulators across the board\n\n13:11.740 --> 13:13.660\n understood the importance of 5G.\n\n13:13.660 --> 13:15.940\n I have not met a regulator that said,\n\n13:15.940 --> 13:18.100\n it's really important to be late on 5G.\n\n13:18.100 --> 13:20.140\n I don't think anybody wants to be late on 5G.\n\n13:20.140 --> 13:22.980\n And as a result, we've seen enormous amount of progress\n\n13:22.980 --> 13:26.300\n in getting spectrum allocated to 5G.\n\n13:26.300 --> 13:29.380\n I think the real issue is the time that it takes\n\n13:29.380 --> 13:31.660\n to build infrastructure.\n\n13:31.660 --> 13:34.220\n You know, investment in 5G infrastructure,\n\n13:34.220 --> 13:37.060\n special millimeter wave is like building roads and ports.\n\n13:37.060 --> 13:38.820\n It's critical infrastructure.\n\n13:38.820 --> 13:40.060\n And those things take time.\n\n13:40.060 --> 13:41.660\n Like one of the number one obstacle\n\n13:41.660 --> 13:45.020\n you're gonna hear from operators is site permit.\n\n13:45.020 --> 13:47.780\n You know, sometimes they have to negotiate municipality\n\n13:47.780 --> 13:51.740\n by municipality about permits to get new cell sites.\n\n13:51.740 --> 13:54.220\n But you know, the networks will be densified\n\n13:54.220 --> 13:56.740\n and you're gonna need all of that capacity\n\n13:56.740 --> 14:01.100\n for the promise of the fully immersive augmented reality\n\n14:01.100 --> 14:03.940\n that will replace phones and everything being connected\n\n14:03.940 --> 14:05.580\n 100% of the time.\n\n14:05.580 --> 14:07.940\n This would not be a conversation with the CEO\n\n14:07.940 --> 14:12.060\n if I did not ask questions that make you nervous.\n\n14:12.980 --> 14:15.900\n Some people raise concerns about there not being enough\n\n14:15.900 --> 14:19.380\n studies about the effects of 5G on the human body.\n\n14:19.380 --> 14:21.380\n Is 5G safe?\n\n14:21.380 --> 14:26.380\n Look, I have a very simple answer to this question.\n\n14:26.380 --> 14:31.380\n As we build new capabilities, such as 5G,\n\n14:31.380 --> 14:34.700\n power is going down, especially when you think\n\n14:34.700 --> 14:37.940\n about reducing the number of base stations,\n\n14:37.940 --> 14:40.420\n the network's becoming more dense.\n\n14:40.420 --> 14:45.420\n So as you do that, the power becomes lower.\n\n14:45.420 --> 14:49.420\n If your phone radiated from the phone and from the tower,\n\n14:49.420 --> 14:51.220\n as you get closer to the tower,\n\n14:51.220 --> 14:53.460\n you don't need that much power to reach the tower.\n\n14:53.460 --> 14:56.860\n So as we move from 4G to 5G,\n\n14:56.860 --> 15:00.100\n I think we see a reduction in the amount of power\n\n15:00.100 --> 15:02.860\n is required to close the radio link.\n\n15:02.860 --> 15:05.860\n Now, also you have a number of organizations,\n\n15:05.860 --> 15:09.460\n the FCC, for example, has rigorous programs,\n\n15:09.460 --> 15:14.460\n which they do a lot of tests to validate, you know,\n\n15:14.460 --> 15:16.780\n the safety of those devices.\n\n15:16.780 --> 15:20.300\n And I think we have, has been a model for other countries\n\n15:20.300 --> 15:24.060\n to also to adopt the same things.\n\n15:24.060 --> 15:27.540\n Cellular has been around for a number of decades now.\n\n15:27.540 --> 15:32.540\n I think smartphone is our most beloved device today.\n\n15:32.540 --> 15:35.980\n And I would argue how it's difficult\n\n15:35.980 --> 15:37.780\n to answer those questions,\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:41.380\n but I'll argue that the data to date\n\n15:41.380 --> 15:45.580\n have we seen in 3G and 4G, you know,\n\n15:45.580 --> 15:50.580\n has shown that a lot of the initial concerns\n\n15:53.500 --> 15:55.060\n were not valid.\n\n15:55.060 --> 15:58.620\n We look at 5G, even though it's new, it's just less power.\n\n15:58.620 --> 16:01.900\n So we look at it from a physics standpoint.\n\n16:01.900 --> 16:05.180\n So from a physics, from a biology perspective,\n\n16:05.180 --> 16:08.740\n there's a lot of evidence, there's studies\n\n16:08.740 --> 16:13.060\n that show that it's not dangerous, that it is in fact safe.\n\n16:13.060 --> 16:14.640\n However, the concern that people have\n\n16:14.640 --> 16:17.140\n is when you scale technology exponentially,\n\n16:18.620 --> 16:20.740\n how will that change human civilization?\n\n16:20.740 --> 16:22.340\n I mean, that doesn't apply to 5G,\n\n16:22.340 --> 16:23.980\n that applies to every technology.\n\n16:23.980 --> 16:27.300\n How, you said smartphone is the most beloved device,\n\n16:27.300 --> 16:29.940\n but love sometimes hurts.\n\n16:29.940 --> 16:33.380\n That's the impact on society we don't know.\n\n16:33.380 --> 16:34.700\n And there's a little bit of fear,\n\n16:34.700 --> 16:36.740\n there's both excitement and fear.\n\n16:36.740 --> 16:39.180\n It's a great topic of conversation actually.\n\n16:39.180 --> 16:41.160\n So let me give you my perspective on this.\n\n16:41.160 --> 16:42.500\n And you started to see some things\n\n16:42.500 --> 16:43.700\n actually happening right now.\n\n16:43.700 --> 16:47.140\n So let me step back and let's talk about the fact\n\n16:47.140 --> 16:51.020\n that we are in a fully interconnected society.\n\n16:51.020 --> 16:56.020\n That when you look of the situation today,\n\n16:56.060 --> 17:01.060\n we talk about smartphones, largest development platform,\n\n17:01.700 --> 17:06.700\n so much now of our life, we are connected to the smartphone.\n\n17:08.500 --> 17:11.580\n And we are all connected and we're connected.\n\n17:11.580 --> 17:15.460\n And then we're building digital twins of everything, right?\n\n17:15.460 --> 17:17.340\n So when you look at that picture,\n\n17:17.340 --> 17:20.140\n when you look at the picture of this connected society,\n\n17:21.460 --> 17:25.140\n you started to have the following thoughts,\n\n17:25.140 --> 17:26.780\n which I think are very healthy,\n\n17:26.780 --> 17:30.220\n which means in the same way that in the physical world,\n\n17:30.220 --> 17:33.720\n you're entitled to some rights, you have obligations,\n\n17:33.720 --> 17:38.720\n and there's a lot of things that protect your integrity.\n\n17:38.720 --> 17:43.580\n I think as a rule, we're gonna see the society evolving.\n\n17:43.580 --> 17:46.740\n So those things extend to your digital being\n\n17:47.680 --> 17:49.340\n of people and things.\n\n17:49.340 --> 17:50.720\n And I think it's just natural.\n\n17:50.720 --> 17:52.140\n It's just natural.\n\n17:52.140 --> 17:54.020\n It's just a natural path.\n\n17:54.020 --> 17:55.540\n And you started to see things like that.\n\n17:55.540 --> 18:00.020\n For example, the Europeans has done a lot in this area.\n\n18:00.020 --> 18:03.940\n I'll say the Europeans probably ahead in the United States\n\n18:03.940 --> 18:06.940\n thinking about privacy laws, digital privacy laws.\n\n18:06.940 --> 18:09.860\n Most recently, the DMA, the Digital Markets Act,\n\n18:09.860 --> 18:11.860\n which I think is a great thing.\n\n18:11.860 --> 18:15.900\n I think we believe there's incredible thought\n\n18:15.900 --> 18:19.260\n into enable ability to regulate the digital markets\n\n18:19.260 --> 18:21.100\n so that there's innovation and competitions\n\n18:21.100 --> 18:24.860\n and not a single company can control all the data\n\n18:24.860 --> 18:28.620\n and then decide how things are gonna be work\n\n18:28.620 --> 18:29.740\n on the digital realm.\n\n18:29.740 --> 18:32.060\n And even if we think about the potential things\n\n18:32.060 --> 18:32.900\n like the metaverse,\n\n18:32.900 --> 18:35.480\n as we're connecting physical and digital spaces.\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:37.500\n So I think it's a natural evolution.\n\n18:37.500 --> 18:42.500\n Of course, regulation and laws always follow technology.\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.620\n But the fact that we're moving\n\n18:45.620 --> 18:49.440\n to an interconnected society, there's no going back.\n\n18:49.440 --> 18:52.040\n We are a fully interconnected society.\n\n18:52.040 --> 18:55.180\n But there is opportunity to think about\n\n18:55.180 --> 18:58.980\n how the digital twin should,\n\n18:58.980 --> 19:00.860\n people and government should think about it\n\n19:00.860 --> 19:03.380\n so that we get the best of a technology\n\n19:03.380 --> 19:05.280\n without any downside.\n\n19:05.280 --> 19:06.900\n Yeah, so when you say digital twin,\n\n19:06.900 --> 19:08.500\n that's one of the other things you're excited about,\n\n19:08.500 --> 19:09.780\n which is the metaverse,\n\n19:09.780 --> 19:13.380\n or basically building worlds in the digital space.\n\n19:13.380 --> 19:14.700\n And you have to start to think about\n\n19:14.700 --> 19:18.500\n all the basic human rights that transfer\n\n19:18.500 --> 19:20.520\n from our physical meat vehicles\n\n19:20.520 --> 19:22.940\n out to the digital copies of ourselves,\n\n19:22.940 --> 19:24.220\n representations of ourselves.\n\n19:24.220 --> 19:25.740\n It's really important to think about.\n\n19:25.740 --> 19:27.820\n The thing you mentioned about regulators that has been,\n\n19:27.820 --> 19:29.740\n this is me speaking frustrating,\n\n19:29.740 --> 19:32.820\n is like you said, they follow technology.\n\n19:32.820 --> 19:36.940\n So sometimes they don't get the technology at all.\n\n19:36.940 --> 19:40.220\n So they're very clumsy in writing laws\n\n19:40.220 --> 19:43.760\n that censor that technology in interesting ways.\n\n19:43.760 --> 19:47.360\n They mean good, but they can do a lot of unintended damage.\n\n19:47.360 --> 19:49.500\n Now, both, it's a dance.\n\n19:49.500 --> 19:50.660\n It's a beautiful dance,\n\n19:50.660 --> 19:54.120\n but I just wish governments were better dance partners.\n\n19:54.120 --> 19:55.860\n I just see what they're kind of writing now\n\n19:55.860 --> 20:00.380\n about regulating social media and platforms like YouTube,\n\n20:00.380 --> 20:02.460\n and it's just really, really clumsy.\n\n20:02.460 --> 20:04.620\n They don't understand how machine learning works.\n\n20:04.620 --> 20:06.260\n I recommend their systems work.\n\n20:06.260 --> 20:08.960\n And I just wish they kind of caught up a little more\n\n20:08.960 --> 20:12.900\n because it's really important to be great at regulation,\n\n20:12.900 --> 20:15.540\n but also it's important to let companies flourish\n\n20:15.540 --> 20:17.500\n and embrace this new wave of technology.\n\n20:17.500 --> 20:20.420\n That weird dance, I am more and more learning\n\n20:20.420 --> 20:22.620\n looking at public policy,\n\n20:22.620 --> 20:25.620\n how much positive government can do\n\n20:25.620 --> 20:28.060\n and how much clumsy negative it can do,\n\n20:28.060 --> 20:31.240\n unintentionally, just out of sheer incompetence\n\n20:31.240 --> 20:33.120\n or lack of curiosity about tech.\n\n20:34.180 --> 20:36.900\n That's my rant about regulators.\n\n20:36.900 --> 20:38.380\n I think it's a valid point.\n\n20:39.280 --> 20:41.300\n As I said before, I think the Europeans\n\n20:41.300 --> 20:43.460\n probably have a very good framework,\n\n20:43.460 --> 20:46.220\n but the way I'll think about it,\n\n20:46.220 --> 20:50.260\n we depend on having the ability to innovate.\n\n20:50.260 --> 20:51.580\n We depend on the free markets.\n\n20:51.580 --> 20:56.580\n We depend on the ability to create technology\n\n20:56.700 --> 20:59.300\n that will be disruptive.\n\n20:59.300 --> 21:01.140\n But at the same time, I think the tech companies\n\n21:01.140 --> 21:04.860\n probably should spend time helping governments understand,\n\n21:04.860 --> 21:06.980\n helping understand ahead of time\n\n21:06.980 --> 21:08.880\n so that they can be better prepared.\n\n21:09.980 --> 21:13.780\n Let's talk about one of my favorite topics, Snapdragon.\n\n21:14.840 --> 21:17.380\n So Snapdragon is a system on a chip.\n\n21:17.380 --> 21:20.540\n This processor has probably powered billions of smartphones\n\n21:21.420 --> 21:23.940\n over its pretty long history now,\n\n21:23.940 --> 21:26.120\n a decade and a half maybe.\n\n21:26.120 --> 21:27.320\n So it's constantly iterating.\n\n21:27.320 --> 21:29.540\n There's constantly just like a turmoil of beautiful\n\n21:29.540 --> 21:30.660\n innovations happening.\n\n21:30.660 --> 21:34.220\n So last year it was Snapdragon 888 was the main one\n\n21:34.220 --> 21:35.700\n with the five nanometer,\n\n21:35.700 --> 21:40.100\n and this year it's Snapdragon 8Gen1.\n\n21:40.100 --> 21:41.700\n It's a new naming scheme.\n\n21:41.700 --> 21:44.820\n Okay, what's the sexiest, most beautiful idea\n\n21:44.820 --> 21:47.060\n or concept to you about Snapdragon?\n\n21:47.060 --> 21:47.980\n Start there.\n\n21:47.980 --> 21:49.100\n The way I would describe it,\n\n21:49.100 --> 21:53.340\n and I think the reason we have been successful with it,\n\n21:53.340 --> 21:58.340\n is to really understand how to build a platform,\n\n21:59.380 --> 22:01.620\n a single chip, like a single chip,\n\n22:02.780 --> 22:06.300\n that will have every single capability\n\n22:06.300 --> 22:08.860\n if you wanna make this smartphone\n\n22:08.860 --> 22:10.140\n in the palm of your hand,\n\n22:11.360 --> 22:13.540\n something that has all of your computing needs.\n\n22:13.540 --> 22:15.220\n And it was the ability to get,\n\n22:15.220 --> 22:17.340\n from an engineering standpoint,\n\n22:17.340 --> 22:20.140\n ability to get into a single chip\n\n22:20.140 --> 22:24.260\n of not only all possible connectivity technology,\n\n22:24.260 --> 22:26.700\n from cellular to wifi to Bluetooth\n\n22:26.700 --> 22:29.980\n to every single constellation of satellites\n\n22:29.980 --> 22:31.540\n for position location.\n\n22:31.540 --> 22:33.580\n But at the same time,\n\n22:33.580 --> 22:38.580\n a very power efficient single thread and multi threaded CPU.\n\n22:39.540 --> 22:44.500\n A GPU for all of your graphic demands,\n\n22:44.500 --> 22:47.620\n gaming, fastest growing segment for gaming,\n\n22:47.620 --> 22:50.100\n is mobile gaming.\n\n22:50.100 --> 22:52.180\n An artificial intelligence processor,\n\n22:52.180 --> 22:55.140\n which we call the neuro processor unit.\n\n22:55.140 --> 22:58.040\n And then a video engine,\n\n22:58.040 --> 23:01.660\n and a multimedia engine for every single application,\n\n23:01.660 --> 23:03.780\n audio, everything.\n\n23:03.780 --> 23:06.460\n So it's a single chip\n\n23:06.460 --> 23:09.380\n that has every single computing technology\n\n23:09.380 --> 23:10.620\n you need in the phone.\n\n23:10.620 --> 23:14.340\n And what's exciting about it is what we already knew.\n\n23:14.340 --> 23:17.340\n For example, when you think about camera or computer vision,\n\n23:17.340 --> 23:20.720\n you see that the advancements in the technology\n\n23:20.720 --> 23:25.120\n now happens in the smartphone first\n\n23:25.120 --> 23:26.360\n versus additional camera.\n\n23:26.360 --> 23:29.160\n So the beauty about the Snapdragon is\n\n23:29.160 --> 23:33.000\n we always have this thing within Qualcomm.\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:35.840\n The phone, it's small.\n\n23:35.840 --> 23:37.240\n You have to be able to hold it.\n\n23:37.240 --> 23:40.600\n You're gonna touch your face so you cannot be hot.\n\n23:40.600 --> 23:43.240\n You have to manage thermals.\n\n23:43.240 --> 23:47.660\n You expect to have a full day of battery life.\n\n23:47.660 --> 23:51.000\n But then you want it to not be sending data\n\n23:51.000 --> 23:53.900\n into 10 or 100 megabits.\n\n23:53.900 --> 23:55.480\n You want gigabits.\n\n23:55.480 --> 23:58.760\n You want it to be able to have eight core processors.\n\n23:58.760 --> 24:01.400\n You want to have a GPU with ray tracing.\n\n24:01.400 --> 24:03.280\n You want to have all of the things\n\n24:03.280 --> 24:08.280\n that you can only get into sometimes a desktop PC.\n\n24:08.520 --> 24:11.340\n And to do all of that in your phone\n\n24:11.340 --> 24:14.140\n and be able to be in the leadership position\n\n24:14.140 --> 24:17.000\n generation after generation is an incredible thing.\n\n24:17.000 --> 24:18.980\n And we're very proud of that at Qualcomm.\n\n24:18.980 --> 24:22.320\n Yeah, so you have to do the WiFi, 5G, all of the...\n\n24:22.320 --> 24:24.960\n And you have to be good to everyone of those technologies.\n\n24:24.960 --> 24:26.280\n And pack it all in.\n\n24:26.280 --> 24:28.760\n And there's also pressure to make the thing\n\n24:28.760 --> 24:30.680\n faster and faster and faster.\n\n24:30.680 --> 24:32.440\n And then there's more and more applications\n\n24:32.440 --> 24:34.800\n you're supposed to be effortlessly using.\n\n24:34.800 --> 24:37.560\n And then you mentioned the NPU, GPU, CPU.\n\n24:37.560 --> 24:40.440\n They have to also dance together somehow.\n\n24:40.440 --> 24:42.800\n They have to communicate well, share memory or not,\n\n24:42.800 --> 24:44.400\n depending on what the application is.\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:46.360\n And your battery has to last all day.\n\n24:48.240 --> 24:49.080\n So think about that.\n\n24:49.080 --> 24:51.840\n From a company like Qualcomm, we have to be good\n\n24:51.840 --> 24:53.760\n in each and every one of those technologies.\n\n24:53.760 --> 24:55.400\n We can't just say, oh, we're a CPU company\n\n24:55.400 --> 24:57.920\n or a GPU company or we're AI company.\n\n24:57.920 --> 24:59.840\n We have to do everything.\n\n24:59.840 --> 25:02.920\n What does it take to design a great processor?\n\n25:02.920 --> 25:06.160\n So design this system on a chip that you mentioned.\n\n25:06.160 --> 25:08.120\n Is there some insight you can provide\n\n25:08.120 --> 25:13.120\n in this chaos of engineers, designers, leaders,\n\n25:15.520 --> 25:16.840\n the people that think about how much\n\n25:16.840 --> 25:19.760\n this is all gonna cost, the whole mess of it?\n\n25:19.760 --> 25:21.760\n I'm, of course, very partial about it.\n\n25:21.760 --> 25:25.000\n I've been in this company for probably more than 26 years.\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:28.500\n But I will argue that there are a couple things\n\n25:28.500 --> 25:31.880\n that are ingredients for success.\n\n25:31.880 --> 25:33.400\n So we talk about the fact that they have\n\n25:33.400 --> 25:34.640\n all those different technologies.\n\n25:34.640 --> 25:36.240\n They evolve at their own pace.\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:38.880\n And you have to be good in each one of them.\n\n25:38.880 --> 25:41.040\n And you need to then to make them working together.\n\n25:41.040 --> 25:44.900\n So you need to have an engineering organization\n\n25:44.900 --> 25:49.900\n that's with an incredible collaboration culture\n\n25:50.560 --> 25:52.600\n because everybody has to be working.\n\n25:52.600 --> 25:54.280\n The train's gonna leave the station.\n\n25:54.280 --> 25:57.720\n Every cart needs to be there when it leaves the station.\n\n25:57.720 --> 25:58.720\n It needs to leave on time,\n\n25:58.720 --> 26:00.280\n especially in the phone business.\n\n26:00.280 --> 26:02.220\n You can't change Christmas.\n\n26:02.220 --> 26:04.060\n You cannot change Black Friday.\n\n26:04.060 --> 26:06.480\n You cannot change all of the selling seasons.\n\n26:06.480 --> 26:08.960\n So the phones are gonna launch on time.\n\n26:08.960 --> 26:10.280\n And every technology needs to be there.\n\n26:10.280 --> 26:12.760\n The engineer needs to work as one.\n\n26:12.760 --> 26:14.620\n And we do have that at Qualcomm.\n\n26:14.620 --> 26:18.440\n The other thing, you have to have incredible discipline\n\n26:18.440 --> 26:22.680\n because those are very complex systems.\n\n26:22.680 --> 26:26.960\n So in one way, you have to design with quality\n\n26:28.320 --> 26:32.080\n because in many cases, we're gonna be ramping production.\n\n26:32.080 --> 26:34.760\n And even before we have the silicon back\n\n26:34.760 --> 26:38.400\n and you have to rely on our simulation models\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:41.480\n and you have to rely on the fact\n\n26:41.480 --> 26:45.060\n that you design for commercial applications.\n\n26:45.060 --> 26:48.200\n That takes a while to build.\n\n26:48.200 --> 26:52.120\n And it's probably been the history\n\n26:52.120 --> 26:54.140\n of a semiconductor business at Qualcomm.\n\n26:54.140 --> 26:55.480\n So you mean like the framework\n\n26:55.480 --> 26:57.680\n of how many people can use simulation software\n\n26:57.680 --> 26:59.960\n and all that kind of stuff to build the thing\n\n26:59.960 --> 27:02.840\n with a hard deadline that you might not even get back\n\n27:02.840 --> 27:05.720\n from like manufacturer before.\n\n27:06.760 --> 27:08.200\n You're not allowed to have any mistakes.\n\n27:08.200 --> 27:11.080\n No wonder our name is quality communications.\n\n27:11.080 --> 27:13.440\n Oh, I never even thought about the qual part.\n\n27:13.440 --> 27:14.600\n Quality.\n\n27:14.600 --> 27:17.400\n So quality and there's a bar that's high\n\n27:17.400 --> 27:19.040\n and you're not allowed to mess up.\n\n27:19.040 --> 27:21.000\n I mean, to me as an engineer, that's exciting.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:25.800\n Hard deadlines, no room for mistakes.\n\n27:25.800 --> 27:26.640\n I love it.\n\n27:26.640 --> 27:27.960\n Super stressful, but I love it.\n\n27:27.960 --> 27:31.960\n So there's a couple of other small companies\n\n27:33.760 --> 27:36.200\n called Google and Apple.\n\n27:36.200 --> 27:39.440\n So Google is now using its own chip for the Pixel 6.\n\n27:39.440 --> 27:41.560\n Apple using its own.\n\n27:41.560 --> 27:45.680\n How does Qualcomm out compete Google and Apple?\n\n27:45.680 --> 27:46.840\n How does it beat them?\n\n27:46.840 --> 27:48.520\n We don't have to out compete Google.\n\n27:48.520 --> 27:51.240\n Actually, if you look at our mobile strategy today,\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:53.640\n and then one thing I was very clear when I became CEO,\n\n27:53.640 --> 27:55.240\n I think there's a lot of confusion in the market.\n\n27:55.240 --> 27:58.080\n Our mobile strategy is very clear.\n\n27:58.080 --> 28:02.000\n We are focused of making Snapdragon synonymous\n\n28:02.000 --> 28:04.840\n with premium Android experience.\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:06.160\n That's what Snapdragon is.\n\n28:06.160 --> 28:08.400\n Android, the phone of the people.\n\n28:08.400 --> 28:09.240\n Yes.\n\n28:10.680 --> 28:12.120\n I just have a love for Android.\n\n28:12.120 --> 28:13.920\n I'm constantly talking trash to iPhone people.\n\n28:13.920 --> 28:14.760\n Sorry, go ahead.\n\n28:14.760 --> 28:16.640\n Premium Android experiences.\n\n28:16.640 --> 28:20.680\n So we do produce Snapdragon in multiple tier\n\n28:20.680 --> 28:23.640\n for every price point, but every year,\n\n28:23.640 --> 28:26.120\n you mentioned the HN1,\n\n28:26.120 --> 28:29.720\n and every year we'll provide the flagship product.\n\n28:29.720 --> 28:33.960\n And then the other series that is trying to get the best\n\n28:33.960 --> 28:36.680\n of every possible technology at that time.\n\n28:36.680 --> 28:41.520\n And it's really focused on enabling the Android ecosystem.\n\n28:41.520 --> 28:42.920\n So I'll give an example.\n\n28:42.920 --> 28:45.400\n So you asked me the question, how to compete with Google.\n\n28:45.400 --> 28:46.640\n It's not about competing with Google.\n\n28:46.640 --> 28:48.600\n We're the number one enabler\n\n28:48.600 --> 28:51.840\n of the Google Android ecosystem.\n\n28:51.840 --> 28:56.320\n And the largest, the number one customer there\n\n28:56.320 --> 28:58.200\n is actually Samsung.\n\n28:58.200 --> 29:00.760\n And if you look what happened to Samsung,\n\n29:00.760 --> 29:04.040\n Samsung, I always said,\n\n29:05.440 --> 29:08.800\n since I began my relationship with them,\n\n29:08.800 --> 29:10.440\n that cause they always had their own chip.\n\n29:10.440 --> 29:12.120\n They always had their own chip.\n\n29:12.120 --> 29:14.800\n And if you'll just look at what happened right now\n\n29:14.800 --> 29:17.960\n with the Galaxy S22 that just launched,\n\n29:17.960 --> 29:21.600\n they used to balance their business about 50% Qualcomm.\n\n29:21.600 --> 29:23.640\n They will get the most advanced markets\n\n29:23.640 --> 29:27.000\n like the United States and China and Japan and Korea,\n\n29:27.000 --> 29:28.440\n they will assign to Qualcomm.\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:31.320\n And then they'll have their own chip for the markets\n\n29:31.320 --> 29:34.040\n that they would be like more emerging markets,\n\n29:34.040 --> 29:35.920\n open markets, markets that they have a control\n\n29:35.920 --> 29:38.440\n on the channel because they sell a lot of appliances\n\n29:38.440 --> 29:39.840\n and other things.\n\n29:39.840 --> 29:42.360\n If you look what happened right now, GS22,\n\n29:42.360 --> 29:46.480\n 75% is Qualcomm.\n\n29:46.480 --> 29:51.480\n And then the next large OEMs and Android ecosystem\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:52.920\n are the Chinese ones.\n\n29:52.920 --> 29:56.600\n Companies like Xiaomi, one of the fastest growing.\n\n29:56.600 --> 30:00.320\n It was number one in Europe at some point last year,\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:03.720\n then followed by Oppo and OnePlus and Vivo.\n\n30:03.720 --> 30:06.640\n So those are some of the largest Qualcomm customers.\n\n30:06.640 --> 30:11.640\n And they actually drive the Android ecosystem.\n\n30:12.640 --> 30:14.200\n And that's our mobile strategy\n\n30:14.200 --> 30:18.720\n and fully aligned with Google and it's working.\n\n30:18.720 --> 30:23.720\n And not to get into a lot of the investor conversation,\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:29.000\n but we're also happy we became a beneficiary\n\n30:29.440 --> 30:31.920\n of the shifts that we saw in the marketplace.\n\n30:31.920 --> 30:35.120\n As Huawei became a smaller OEM\n\n30:35.120 --> 30:37.400\n as a result of the sanctions,\n\n30:37.400 --> 30:42.200\n we saw the rise of a lot of the other OEMs from China,\n\n30:42.200 --> 30:46.160\n especially for China domestic market, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.\n\n30:46.160 --> 30:47.960\n They moved to the premium category\n\n30:47.960 --> 30:49.600\n and they're all doing that with Qualcomm.\n\n30:49.600 --> 30:53.120\n So we're actually very fortunate and happy\n\n30:53.120 --> 30:55.760\n with the position we are in mobile business.\n\n30:55.760 --> 30:57.680\n We do have an Apple relationship.\n\n30:57.680 --> 31:01.000\n We provide modem technology to Apple.\n\n31:02.480 --> 31:03.720\n It's a multi year relationship.\n\n31:03.720 --> 31:07.160\n Apple has been very public that they are investing\n\n31:07.160 --> 31:09.480\n to develop their own modem.\n\n31:09.480 --> 31:12.840\n But the Qualcomm strategy has been clear.\n\n31:12.840 --> 31:15.360\n We're really focused on Snapdragon.\n\n31:16.360 --> 31:18.480\n Our mobile strategy is not defined\n\n31:18.480 --> 31:20.840\n by providing a cellular modem to Apple.\n\n31:20.840 --> 31:23.120\n Our mobile strategy is this that we just talked about it.\n\n31:23.120 --> 31:25.200\n It's about the unique thing of Snapdragon\n\n31:25.200 --> 31:27.360\n that has every single technology\n\n31:27.360 --> 31:29.700\n integrated into a single SOC.\n\n31:29.700 --> 31:32.160\n And provides a premium experience.\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:33.400\n And that's what we're doing\n\n31:33.400 --> 31:37.000\n and focusing on the Android ecosystem.\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:39.720\n I don't know if I can ask you this kind of question.\n\n31:39.720 --> 31:42.240\n It's like picking your children or something like this.\n\n31:42.240 --> 31:45.640\n But what smartphone with a Snapdragon?\n\n31:45.640 --> 31:49.240\n You mentioned Samsung Galaxy S22, OnePlus.\n\n31:49.240 --> 31:52.560\n Those are phones I personally really enjoy.\n\n31:52.560 --> 31:54.380\n What phone do you currently use?\n\n31:54.380 --> 31:55.720\n Or do you have multiple phones?\n\n31:55.720 --> 31:59.720\n I do have multiple phones but I do use Galaxy S22.\n\n31:59.720 --> 32:01.020\n That's your favorite one?\n\n32:01.020 --> 32:03.440\n All right, well you heard it here first folks.\n\n32:03.440 --> 32:04.860\n Okay, so excellent.\n\n32:04.860 --> 32:09.860\n Can Qualcomm also, let's take a brief step away from mobile.\n\n32:09.920 --> 32:13.560\n And take on Intel and Apple and other such companies\n\n32:13.560 --> 32:15.240\n in the laptop and desktop space.\n\n32:15.240 --> 32:18.700\n So the nature of what a computer is seems to be changing.\n\n32:18.700 --> 32:21.320\n It's like smartphones like merging.\n\n32:21.320 --> 32:23.840\n It's all being a smartphone just with the biggest screen\n\n32:23.840 --> 32:24.680\n or something like this.\n\n32:24.680 --> 32:26.740\n So what does the future of that look like?\n\n32:26.740 --> 32:28.400\n Before I answer that question,\n\n32:28.400 --> 32:30.440\n let me just step back a little bit.\n\n32:30.440 --> 32:33.560\n Because, and I'm sure we can talk more about those things.\n\n32:33.560 --> 32:37.920\n But the reality is Qualcomm is changing a lot.\n\n32:37.920 --> 32:40.120\n And we use, I know we spend a lot of time\n\n32:40.120 --> 32:42.760\n talking about 5G and smartphone and Snapdragon.\n\n32:42.760 --> 32:45.480\n And I think that has been what had defined Qualcomm\n\n32:45.480 --> 32:46.320\n for many years.\n\n32:46.320 --> 32:48.720\n But the reality is, even consistent\n\n32:48.720 --> 32:51.580\n with that 5G conversation, which is a technology\n\n32:51.580 --> 32:56.400\n to connect everything, Qualcomm is also changing.\n\n32:56.400 --> 33:00.820\n Our technology that was in many cases designed for phones.\n\n33:00.820 --> 33:05.360\n And we said at the beginning, connectivity and processing.\n\n33:05.360 --> 33:07.880\n It's going to virtually every industry.\n\n33:07.880 --> 33:12.040\n And as a result, Qualcomm is really changing with it\n\n33:12.040 --> 33:15.760\n and expanding to a number of different addressable markets.\n\n33:15.760 --> 33:20.760\n Some of those markets is the PC, as you talk about it.\n\n33:21.060 --> 33:24.580\n The conversions of mobile and PC.\n\n33:24.580 --> 33:27.000\n And the reason I'm excited about this,\n\n33:27.000 --> 33:28.840\n because you see a lot of things happening\n\n33:28.840 --> 33:31.680\n that bring this right front and center\n\n33:31.680 --> 33:33.440\n when you think about the future technology.\n\n33:33.440 --> 33:37.560\n So what we learn with the pandemic\n\n33:37.560 --> 33:42.020\n is that the number one use case of personal computers\n\n33:42.020 --> 33:43.780\n is communications.\n\n33:45.040 --> 33:46.480\n It is interesting when you think about that.\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:49.400\n That's the number one use case on a PC today\n\n33:49.400 --> 33:50.720\n is communications.\n\n33:50.720 --> 33:53.600\n It's actually funny because in the cellular industry,\n\n33:53.600 --> 33:55.240\n actually I'll say, let me step back.\n\n33:55.240 --> 33:59.240\n In the telecom industry, we've been chasing\n\n33:59.240 --> 34:03.720\n this killer application of video telephony for decades.\n\n34:03.720 --> 34:08.060\n I remember back then in the wire line,\n\n34:08.060 --> 34:11.440\n even before the internet and IP, ISDN,\n\n34:11.440 --> 34:15.480\n you remember those AT&T desk phones with a little screen\n\n34:15.480 --> 34:17.200\n and they said, you can do video telephony.\n\n34:17.200 --> 34:21.340\n We don't watch that in Back to the Future 2.\n\n34:21.340 --> 34:23.520\n Then when we started developing 3G,\n\n34:23.520 --> 34:25.680\n people said, what's the application for having data\n\n34:25.680 --> 34:26.520\n to a cell phone?\n\n34:26.520 --> 34:27.600\n All video telephony.\n\n34:27.600 --> 34:29.340\n Then we started doing 4G.\n\n34:30.320 --> 34:32.120\n And in the beginning, people said,\n\n34:32.120 --> 34:33.700\n well, why do you need all of this broadband?\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:35.440\n All video telephony.\n\n34:35.440 --> 34:39.120\n But it took a pandemic to make video telephony\n\n34:39.120 --> 34:40.600\n the killer application.\n\n34:40.600 --> 34:44.860\n And that's now the number one use case on a PC.\n\n34:44.860 --> 34:47.280\n So now think about that for a second.\n\n34:47.280 --> 34:49.440\n Personal computers now, they're technologies\n\n34:49.440 --> 34:50.900\n that people when they were gonna buy a PC,\n\n34:50.900 --> 34:51.880\n they didn't care much about it.\n\n34:51.880 --> 34:53.880\n Now they do, camera.\n\n34:53.880 --> 34:55.760\n Camera, how good is the camera?\n\n34:55.760 --> 34:57.900\n The audio, is that connected?\n\n34:57.900 --> 34:58.920\n How good is the connectivity?\n\n34:58.920 --> 35:01.960\n Do you have the latest and greatest wifi and cellular?\n\n35:01.960 --> 35:03.360\n What's the battery life?\n\n35:03.360 --> 35:04.940\n Because you're gonna be working from anywhere.\n\n35:04.940 --> 35:07.260\n Sometimes you know that, sometimes you're not.\n\n35:07.260 --> 35:09.720\n So all those things, what's the portability like?\n\n35:09.720 --> 35:11.640\n So those things started to change\n\n35:11.640 --> 35:13.720\n how we should think about the PC.\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:15.360\n But I won't stop there.\n\n35:15.360 --> 35:17.080\n Let me talk about another trend.\n\n35:17.080 --> 35:21.800\n So, and all come as a result of what we saw the pandemic.\n\n35:21.800 --> 35:23.440\n Let's say that you are,\n\n35:23.440 --> 35:25.720\n you're an engineer, you do computer aided design.\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:30.340\n You have an advanced desktop computer\n\n35:30.340 --> 35:33.080\n or workstation in your office.\n\n35:33.080 --> 35:35.160\n But you wanna work from home someday.\n\n35:35.160 --> 35:37.240\n So you're not gonna move that to your home.\n\n35:37.240 --> 35:38.120\n So what do you need to do?\n\n35:38.120 --> 35:40.280\n You're gonna have to rely on that.\n\n35:40.280 --> 35:41.840\n You're gonna run that on the cloud.\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:43.120\n And you're gonna run it on the cloud.\n\n35:43.120 --> 35:44.800\n You need high bandwidth\n\n35:44.800 --> 35:46.720\n because you almost wanted the cloud\n\n35:46.720 --> 35:50.360\n to be the same as your computer for that use case.\n\n35:50.360 --> 35:53.600\n That's the 5G on demand computing use case.\n\n35:53.600 --> 35:57.220\n The use 5G is almost a link between two computers.\n\n35:57.220 --> 35:59.640\n But then, you know, CIOs are saying,\n\n35:59.640 --> 36:02.320\n well, my workforce is going home for certain days.\n\n36:02.320 --> 36:04.560\n I want all the data to be in the cloud.\n\n36:04.560 --> 36:07.040\n You look at, for example, Microsoft OneDrive\n\n36:07.040 --> 36:10.320\n or the ability to collaborate, you need the bandwidth.\n\n36:10.320 --> 36:13.840\n So when you put all of those things together,\n\n36:13.840 --> 36:17.240\n you start thinking about what is the next generation PC?\n\n36:17.240 --> 36:19.120\n And that's the opportunity for Qualcomm.\n\n36:19.120 --> 36:21.120\n I'll just give an example.\n\n36:21.120 --> 36:26.120\n Back in Mobile World Congress recently, Lenovo,\n\n36:26.880 --> 36:31.880\n they have a line of enterprise laptops called the ThinkPad.\n\n36:32.560 --> 36:34.040\n I'm sure you're familiar with it.\n\n36:34.040 --> 36:38.280\n So they announced the ThinkPad based on Snapdragon.\n\n36:38.280 --> 36:42.960\n With 5G on, 28 hours of battery life.\n\n36:42.960 --> 36:45.800\n So that's next generation.\n\n36:45.800 --> 36:49.160\n It's just a nice screen with extremely high, nice screen\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:52.360\n and keyboard, and extremely high connectivity\n\n36:52.360 --> 36:54.920\n to maybe an even more, like a more powerful machine\n\n36:54.920 --> 36:55.760\n in the cloud.\n\n36:55.760 --> 36:57.920\n Something more, the data, connecting to the data,\n\n36:57.920 --> 36:59.600\n connecting to compute, all that kind of stuff.\n\n36:59.600 --> 37:01.560\n You have the camera capabilities,\n\n37:01.560 --> 37:03.240\n and let me go one step more.\n\n37:03.240 --> 37:05.720\n Microsoft talking about some of the other features\n\n37:05.720 --> 37:10.720\n they're doing now using, on Windows 11, using Snapdragon.\n\n37:10.980 --> 37:12.000\n Remember, we talk about it,\n\n37:12.000 --> 37:15.620\n Snapdragon has an AI processor inside there.\n\n37:15.620 --> 37:19.120\n So one of the cool features Microsoft's talking about it is\n\n37:19.120 --> 37:22.000\n you can be on a Teams call, and you can make sure\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:25.760\n your eyes are looking at the camera 100% of the time.\n\n37:25.760 --> 37:27.160\n Well, that's an interesting,\n\n37:27.160 --> 37:28.000\n so they can be talking about that.\n\n37:28.000 --> 37:29.320\n And you do that with AI.\n\n37:29.320 --> 37:32.160\n Yes, that's really tricky to pull off.\n\n37:32.160 --> 37:34.080\n For example, the reason I'm a huge stickler\n\n37:34.080 --> 37:36.640\n for doing these in person, these conversations in person,\n\n37:36.640 --> 37:38.280\n it's really tough to get right.\n\n37:38.280 --> 37:39.960\n But it's a worthy challenge.\n\n37:39.960 --> 37:41.820\n So that's where the metaverse hopes to,\n\n37:41.820 --> 37:43.900\n so like, I just, because you said the importance\n\n37:43.900 --> 37:46.320\n of this telephony of humans connecting,\n\n37:46.320 --> 37:48.760\n teleporting themselves, getting that right\n\n37:48.760 --> 37:49.920\n is really difficult.\n\n37:49.920 --> 37:52.120\n There's a lot of people hate Zoom meetings,\n\n37:52.120 --> 37:55.480\n but that doesn't mean you can't improve that experience\n\n37:55.480 --> 37:57.240\n and get rid of the hate.\n\n37:57.240 --> 37:59.120\n A lot of people hate talking to their car too,\n\n37:59.120 --> 38:02.060\n because the voice, the natural language processing\n\n38:02.060 --> 38:04.920\n is terrible, but when it's not, it's a beautiful thing.\n\n38:04.920 --> 38:06.120\n So getting that right is.\n\n38:06.120 --> 38:08.400\n This is an opportunity, this is an opportunity.\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:10.520\n Think about it, it starts with the PC,\n\n38:10.520 --> 38:14.320\n making the PC giving you a better experience for teams,\n\n38:14.320 --> 38:18.200\n but then it goes right back into this trend\n\n38:18.200 --> 38:20.520\n of connecting physical and digital spaces.\n\n38:20.520 --> 38:23.240\n And all the work we're doing with the metaverse\n\n38:23.240 --> 38:25.280\n and virtual reality and metareality in the future\n\n38:25.280 --> 38:28.680\n is why not call somebody or connect with somebody\n\n38:28.680 --> 38:30.420\n with a hologram, it's possible.\n\n38:30.420 --> 38:33.840\n And also to mention some increasing amount\n\n38:33.840 --> 38:36.080\n of intelligence in our cars.\n\n38:36.080 --> 38:38.080\n So semi autonomous, autonomous cars,\n\n38:38.080 --> 38:41.840\n and the interactivity between human and car,\n\n38:41.840 --> 38:44.920\n which for me, things are really exciting.\n\n38:44.920 --> 38:46.080\n Let me ask you a big question.\n\n38:46.080 --> 38:49.600\n So when aliens again now on the other side, right,\n\n38:49.600 --> 38:51.720\n and humans destroy themselves through nuclear war\n\n38:51.720 --> 38:52.760\n centuries from now.\n\n38:52.760 --> 38:53.600\n Let's hope not.\n\n38:53.600 --> 38:54.420\n Let's hope not.\n\n38:54.420 --> 38:56.200\n But in case, you know, let's just hypothetical\n\n38:56.200 --> 38:57.040\n thought experiment.\n\n38:57.040 --> 39:00.400\n And they write a history of humanity in the 21st century.\n\n39:01.720 --> 39:05.560\n What would they remember Qualcomm in the 21st century\n\n39:05.560 --> 39:06.400\n as a company?\n\n39:06.400 --> 39:08.160\n Would it be a car company?\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:10.720\n Like think of all the crazy pivots that might happen\n\n39:10.720 --> 39:13.240\n in the next like 50 years.\n\n39:13.240 --> 39:15.840\n Because you're thinking, you said Qualcomm enables\n\n39:15.840 --> 39:18.680\n all of these things with 5G and there'll be probably\n\n39:18.680 --> 39:20.920\n other Gs, it keeps increasing.\n\n39:20.920 --> 39:23.640\n So basically connectivity and computation\n\n39:23.640 --> 39:25.800\n and everything becomes connected and everything\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:27.720\n is capable of computation.\n\n39:27.720 --> 39:30.920\n Might you become a robotics and car company?\n\n39:30.920 --> 39:35.920\n I will argue we're already an automotive company today.\n\n39:36.600 --> 39:40.420\n But let me tell you what I would like Qualcomm to be,\n\n39:40.420 --> 39:42.040\n remember and recognize for.\n\n39:43.040 --> 39:47.040\n I think everyone that knows Qualcomm immediately,\n\n39:47.040 --> 39:49.920\n you know, connect us, pun intended,\n\n39:49.920 --> 39:52.040\n to connectivity and wireless.\n\n39:52.040 --> 39:54.840\n But the reality is we're being actually the company\n\n39:54.840 --> 39:58.760\n providing intelligence and processing to everything\n\n39:58.760 --> 40:01.960\n on the edge, everything outside the data center\n\n40:01.960 --> 40:02.920\n that we're doing.\n\n40:02.920 --> 40:05.820\n Those billions of devices that are gonna be connected.\n\n40:05.820 --> 40:08.780\n And that's kind of explained when we talk about\n\n40:08.780 --> 40:11.580\n the connected intelligent edge, the beyond phones,\n\n40:11.580 --> 40:13.960\n cars, species, and all of those.\n\n40:13.960 --> 40:16.520\n And the broader IOTs, we talk about everything\n\n40:16.520 --> 40:18.040\n will be connected and intelligent.\n\n40:18.040 --> 40:20.880\n And that's what we want Qualcomm to be recognized for.\n\n40:20.880 --> 40:23.120\n So by the way, for people who are not familiar,\n\n40:23.120 --> 40:25.000\n there's some technical jargon.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.520\n People use the word edge, like edge computing.\n\n40:28.520 --> 40:30.720\n It's, by the way, that's probably changing\n\n40:30.720 --> 40:31.960\n what that even means.\n\n40:31.960 --> 40:34.040\n But it's basically everything that's not a giant thing\n\n40:34.040 --> 40:36.280\n that's making a lot of noise in a building somewhere.\n\n40:36.280 --> 40:39.940\n So it's mobile devices and the mobile devices\n\n40:39.940 --> 40:42.440\n of all kinds, well, a refrigerator's not mobile,\n\n40:42.440 --> 40:43.720\n but it would be edge.\n\n40:43.720 --> 40:46.740\n So it's like what's a sandwich, that kind of discussion.\n\n40:48.640 --> 40:53.160\n But basically edge computing is the edge\n\n40:53.160 --> 40:56.300\n of that expanding space that you mentioned\n\n40:56.300 --> 40:59.240\n that Qualcomm is trying to connect\n\n40:59.240 --> 41:00.680\n and enable with computation.\n\n41:00.680 --> 41:04.000\n Here's a simple way to describe what the edge is\n\n41:04.000 --> 41:05.520\n and edge computing is.\n\n41:05.520 --> 41:08.520\n I think as we think about the evolution of the data center,\n\n41:09.560 --> 41:12.400\n you need to bring the computational closer\n\n41:12.400 --> 41:14.040\n to where the device is.\n\n41:14.040 --> 41:17.000\n Also, when you put the computation together\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:19.720\n with the connectivity at the same time,\n\n41:19.720 --> 41:22.000\n you're gonna see a lot of advancement\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:25.120\n of artificial intelligence happening closer\n\n41:25.120 --> 41:26.760\n or at the device.\n\n41:26.760 --> 41:29.480\n Look, it's a very, I have a simple way to describe it.\n\n41:29.480 --> 41:31.940\n Remember in the beginning of this conversation,\n\n41:31.940 --> 41:35.720\n we talk about in the 4G era, broadband\n\n41:35.720 --> 41:38.920\n and mobile computing evolved side by side.\n\n41:38.920 --> 41:40.000\n If you're gonna have broadband,\n\n41:40.000 --> 41:41.920\n you might as well have a computer in the palm of your hand.\n\n41:41.920 --> 41:45.160\n So we needed to invest in those two technologies.\n\n41:45.160 --> 41:49.840\n In 5G, AI develops side by side.\n\n41:49.840 --> 41:52.480\n You're connected to the cloud 100% of the time.\n\n41:52.480 --> 41:54.400\n You have a high bandwidth and you have now\n\n41:54.400 --> 41:56.880\n a smart and intelligent thing that can make decision\n\n41:56.880 --> 42:00.720\n in real time, provide context information to the cloud\n\n42:00.720 --> 42:02.480\n to make the models more accurate\n\n42:02.480 --> 42:05.240\n and as well compare and contrast to the cloud.\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:08.520\n So there's gonna be an exponential development of AI\n\n42:08.520 --> 42:11.840\n happening with all the edge devices,\n\n42:11.840 --> 42:14.240\n the devices that are outside the data center\n\n42:14.240 --> 42:16.880\n and computation is gonna go alongside that.\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:19.600\n And a great example of that is the car.\n\n42:19.600 --> 42:22.880\n The car, we haven't talked much about the car,\n\n42:22.880 --> 42:26.600\n but Qualcomm is now, you could argue was as much\n\n42:26.600 --> 42:28.680\n as an automotive company as wireless company,\n\n42:28.680 --> 42:32.000\n working 26 global brands.\n\n42:32.000 --> 42:36.440\n And it's easy to see, if you look at our mobile heritage\n\n42:36.440 --> 42:40.900\n and we talk about form factors, thermal, battery life,\n\n42:40.900 --> 42:43.440\n you're not gonna put a server in a trunk of a car,\n\n42:43.440 --> 42:46.520\n but you need as much computational capabilities.\n\n42:46.520 --> 42:49.760\n And that's we see Qualcomm providing,\n\n42:49.760 --> 42:53.120\n as the car become a connected computer on wheels,\n\n42:53.120 --> 42:56.120\n we provide the computational and all the sensors\n\n42:56.120 --> 42:57.680\n for you to do assisted driving\n\n42:57.680 --> 42:59.800\n for the new digital cockpit experience\n\n42:59.800 --> 43:01.560\n connecting the car to the cloud\n\n43:01.560 --> 43:03.960\n and it's all of that's happening at the edge.\n\n43:03.960 --> 43:05.920\n Does Qualcomm want to be the brain\n\n43:05.920 --> 43:07.800\n of a lot of autonomous vehicles in the future\n\n43:07.800 --> 43:10.480\n of different, you said brands, like Mercedes,\n\n43:10.480 --> 43:13.320\n BMW, I don't know, whatever, just whatever car.\n\n43:13.320 --> 43:15.760\n Cars have the sexy thing they do\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:18.520\n and then it defines their brand and so on.\n\n43:18.520 --> 43:19.840\n And then there's the brain\n\n43:19.840 --> 43:22.480\n that doesn't need to have branding supposedly.\n\n43:22.480 --> 43:23.860\n So does Qualcomm see that\n\n43:23.860 --> 43:26.480\n or will I be able to buy a Qualcomm car?\n\n43:26.480 --> 43:27.480\n Like literally it'll be Qualcomm.\n\n43:27.480 --> 43:29.280\n No, you're not gonna be able to buy a Qualcomm car,\n\n43:29.280 --> 43:34.280\n but we are ready on our way to become the brains of the car.\n\n43:35.920 --> 43:38.640\n The way you should think about Qualcomm automotive strategy\n\n43:38.640 --> 43:42.160\n is the car companies realize\n\n43:42.160 --> 43:44.160\n they need to become technology companies.\n\n43:44.160 --> 43:47.120\n You just look, for example, of the market cap\n\n43:47.120 --> 43:50.760\n of some of the new electrical commerce\n\n43:50.760 --> 43:55.680\n and compare them with the legacy car companies.\n\n43:55.680 --> 43:56.520\n Which one is that?\n\n43:56.520 --> 44:00.640\n I heard of, one of them lives in Austin.\n\n44:00.640 --> 44:02.200\n Let's say Rivian, right?\n\n44:02.200 --> 44:03.040\n Rivian.\n\n44:03.040 --> 44:03.880\n Oh, that one too, yes.\n\n44:03.880 --> 44:05.680\n You know, the car companies are not going away.\n\n44:05.680 --> 44:09.640\n It's actually a mistake not to bet in the car companies.\n\n44:09.640 --> 44:12.640\n The car companies need a technology partner.\n\n44:12.640 --> 44:16.680\n They will provide the digital chassis for them.\n\n44:16.680 --> 44:18.120\n And that's what we're doing.\n\n44:18.120 --> 44:19.240\n So if you look at Qualcomm,\n\n44:19.240 --> 44:22.320\n we talk about a Snapdragon digital chassis.\n\n44:22.320 --> 44:27.320\n So we want to be the preferred technology partner\n\n44:27.680 --> 44:30.680\n of the car companies, and I think it's working.\n\n44:30.680 --> 44:32.000\n Strategy is working right now.\n\n44:32.000 --> 44:34.680\n So basically helping the car companies\n\n44:34.680 --> 44:37.680\n accelerate into becoming technology companies.\n\n44:37.680 --> 44:39.380\n Connecting the car to the cloud,\n\n44:39.380 --> 44:42.920\n redesign the interior of the digital cockpit experience,\n\n44:42.920 --> 44:45.520\n and provide the computation and sensor capabilities\n\n44:45.520 --> 44:47.400\n for autonomy and assisted driving.\n\n44:48.280 --> 44:50.800\n On the topic of robots, when millions or billions\n\n44:50.800 --> 44:54.320\n of robots roam the earth in the future among us humans,\n\n44:54.320 --> 44:59.320\n and I am for one concerned in a small percentage,\n\n44:59.560 --> 45:02.200\n but largely I'm excited about that future,\n\n45:02.200 --> 45:07.200\n will Qualcomm be the thing that powers their brain?\n\n45:08.520 --> 45:10.840\n We have in our IoT business,\n\n45:10.840 --> 45:13.860\n which has been one of the fastest growing business for us,\n\n45:13.860 --> 45:16.860\n a number of robotics engagement.\n\n45:16.860 --> 45:18.980\n So I'll give you some example.\n\n45:18.980 --> 45:23.180\n If you look of the Amazon Astro,\n\n45:23.180 --> 45:24.220\n you familiar with that?\n\n45:24.220 --> 45:27.840\n There's two Snapdragon in there.\n\n45:28.860 --> 45:29.700\n There is?\n\n45:29.700 --> 45:30.540\n This is really exciting.\n\n45:30.540 --> 45:31.460\n They're supposed to ship it to me.\n\n45:31.460 --> 45:32.340\n Where is it?\n\n45:32.340 --> 45:33.880\n Okay, but anyway, that's really cool.\n\n45:33.880 --> 45:35.100\n I didn't know it was Snapdragon.\n\n45:35.100 --> 45:39.720\n Yeah, we're working with robotics in industrial.\n\n45:39.720 --> 45:41.300\n Of course, drones.\n\n45:41.300 --> 45:44.900\n We're getting more and more traction for robotics.\n\n45:44.900 --> 45:45.740\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n45:45.740 --> 45:47.260\n Industrial robotics, too, you said?\n\n45:47.260 --> 45:50.380\n Industrial, especially when you think about\n\n45:51.940 --> 45:55.760\n what's gonna happen with the factory of the future,\n\n45:55.760 --> 45:57.060\n the industrial side of the future,\n\n45:57.060 --> 45:58.200\n the warehouse of the future,\n\n45:58.200 --> 46:01.520\n when you bring 5G, for example, to it,\n\n46:01.520 --> 46:04.540\n and you have a number of different use cases,\n\n46:04.540 --> 46:09.120\n and then you see a lot of robotics application.\n\n46:09.120 --> 46:11.820\n And of course, drones.\n\n46:11.820 --> 46:16.500\n And the most famous, I will consider that a robot,\n\n46:16.500 --> 46:19.960\n the most famous robot in the world right now,\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:21.300\n it's powered by Snapdragon,\n\n46:21.300 --> 46:24.500\n which is the Mars Ingenuity helicopter.\n\n46:24.500 --> 46:27.360\n The whole helicopter, the cameras and everything,\n\n46:27.360 --> 46:28.780\n it's powered by Snapdragon.\n\n46:28.780 --> 46:32.780\n And talking about exciting thing for an engineer,\n\n46:32.780 --> 46:35.140\n the same Snapdragon that goes to a phone,\n\n46:35.140 --> 46:37.740\n and it can go to a Galaxy phone, for example, Samsung,\n\n46:37.740 --> 46:41.380\n the same, not a special one, went all the way to Mars.\n\n46:42.260 --> 46:45.020\n Is exploring other planets, looking for alien life,\n\n46:45.020 --> 46:46.120\n and maybe gets to meet them.\n\n46:46.120 --> 46:47.100\n Wouldn't that be interesting,\n\n46:47.100 --> 46:49.720\n if a Snapdragon is the thing that first sees an alien?\n\n46:49.720 --> 46:50.640\n It's like, what the hell?\n\n46:50.640 --> 46:52.340\n We did not program this in the computer vision.\n\n46:52.340 --> 46:53.980\n I once used the example to go back\n\n46:53.980 --> 46:57.140\n to the conversation we had about quality.\n\n46:57.140 --> 46:59.580\n As an engineer, you need to make sure it works.\n\n46:59.580 --> 47:01.260\n Can you imagine if it gets over there on Mars\n\n47:01.260 --> 47:02.100\n and it doesn't work?\n\n47:02.100 --> 47:04.060\n Listen, this is very stressful.\n\n47:04.060 --> 47:07.020\n What NASA, what SpaceX, what all those companies are doing\n\n47:07.020 --> 47:08.100\n is extremely stressful.\n\n47:08.100 --> 47:10.580\n The room for mistakes is tiny.\n\n47:10.580 --> 47:13.280\n But that's super exciting for an engineer, once again.\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:17.340\n There's been a global semiconductor chip shortage.\n\n47:17.340 --> 47:19.720\n So from your perspective, just it'd be interesting\n\n47:19.720 --> 47:23.380\n to get your expert analysis of the situation.\n\n47:23.380 --> 47:24.780\n What do you think are the main reasons\n\n47:24.780 --> 47:28.580\n and how has Qualcomm been affected and how can it help?\n\n47:28.580 --> 47:31.380\n In this, in the future, things like it.\n\n47:31.380 --> 47:36.380\n Okay, that's a big topic of conversation.\n\n47:36.380 --> 47:38.060\n And we only have five minutes.\n\n47:38.060 --> 47:41.880\n So I'll try to be as objective as I can.\n\n47:41.880 --> 47:43.780\n So first, let's talk about what caused it.\n\n47:43.780 --> 47:46.460\n And you hear a lot of different things.\n\n47:46.460 --> 47:48.820\n I will try to put it within the right context.\n\n47:48.820 --> 47:51.320\n The first thing that caused it, really,\n\n47:51.320 --> 47:54.900\n is the acceleration of digital transformation\n\n47:54.900 --> 47:59.180\n of pretty much everything in every industry.\n\n47:59.180 --> 48:01.340\n Every industry has been digitally transformed.\n\n48:01.340 --> 48:04.940\n And as such, the amount of semiconductors\n\n48:04.940 --> 48:07.420\n that are required is much larger.\n\n48:07.420 --> 48:09.020\n Just to give you a practical example,\n\n48:09.020 --> 48:11.660\n if you think about the automotive as an example,\n\n48:11.660 --> 48:15.100\n the cars that are, there's cars that are launched,\n\n48:15.100 --> 48:17.180\n a new model launching today.\n\n48:17.180 --> 48:20.700\n The new model launching today most likely has 10X\n\n48:20.700 --> 48:23.940\n the amount of chips of the prior model.\n\n48:23.940 --> 48:25.700\n And the model that people are working on\n\n48:25.700 --> 48:28.460\n that's coming in next, probably 10X that one.\n\n48:28.460 --> 48:30.140\n So you see the amount of silicon\n\n48:30.140 --> 48:32.580\n and then billions of things become smart.\n\n48:32.580 --> 48:34.420\n More and more data goes to the cloud.\n\n48:34.420 --> 48:35.820\n The data center grows.\n\n48:35.820 --> 48:40.500\n So the floor for semiconductor consumptions went up by a lot.\n\n48:40.500 --> 48:43.180\n Then you have things that aggravated this.\n\n48:43.180 --> 48:45.100\n The pandemic aggravated this.\n\n48:45.100 --> 48:47.820\n There is a couple of trends from the pandemic.\n\n48:47.820 --> 48:50.100\n The enterprise transformation of the home.\n\n48:50.100 --> 48:51.540\n The home became an enterprise.\n\n48:51.540 --> 48:56.540\n Massive amounts of upgrades on broadband and IoT.\n\n48:57.540 --> 49:02.700\n The office has changed to the way we work now,\n\n49:02.700 --> 49:05.300\n including the ability to support collaboration tools\n\n49:05.300 --> 49:06.780\n and video.\n\n49:06.780 --> 49:11.780\n Then you have the higher demand for products\n\n49:14.140 --> 49:17.700\n during the pandemic because people wanted to be connected.\n\n49:17.700 --> 49:19.340\n People bought new phones and new tablets\n\n49:19.340 --> 49:22.140\n and new computers, new gaming.\n\n49:22.140 --> 49:24.780\n So all of those things came on top of that\n\n49:24.780 --> 49:28.580\n as the aggravated issue, but they're not the main issue.\n\n49:28.580 --> 49:33.580\n The main issue is it's actually a long term growth\n\n49:34.020 --> 49:35.180\n of digital.\n\n49:35.180 --> 49:38.380\n So what I'm hearing you say is the pandemic\n\n49:38.380 --> 49:40.780\n was not the cause, it was an aggravation.\n\n49:40.780 --> 49:41.620\n It was an aggravation.\n\n49:41.620 --> 49:46.620\n So is there a way we can support as a human civilization\n\n49:48.260 --> 49:51.420\n in terms of manufacture, in terms of supply,\n\n49:51.420 --> 49:53.900\n the kind of growth that you're talking about\n\n49:53.900 --> 49:55.620\n in devices and so on?\n\n49:55.620 --> 49:58.060\n Is there high level ideas you can say\n\n49:58.060 --> 49:59.940\n of what that's required there?\n\n49:59.940 --> 50:02.500\n Yes, and I think that's the second part of the answer.\n\n50:02.500 --> 50:03.860\n So what's happening now?\n\n50:03.860 --> 50:05.540\n How are we gonna get out of this?\n\n50:05.540 --> 50:10.140\n So we see a lot of capacity investments\n\n50:10.140 --> 50:12.900\n put into place by the industry.\n\n50:12.900 --> 50:15.740\n We had invested a lot with our suppliers.\n\n50:15.740 --> 50:19.500\n A lot of the suppliers had made plans\n\n50:19.500 --> 50:22.140\n about increasing the capacity.\n\n50:22.140 --> 50:24.380\n The industry is planning to double\n\n50:24.380 --> 50:27.180\n its total semiconductor manufacturing capacity\n\n50:27.180 --> 50:30.140\n within the next five years, an example.\n\n50:30.140 --> 50:31.460\n So that's already happening.\n\n50:31.460 --> 50:33.900\n And then you see things which are actually good.\n\n50:33.900 --> 50:35.300\n They're good.\n\n50:35.300 --> 50:38.140\n The initiative such as the United States CHIPS Act\n\n50:38.140 --> 50:40.620\n and now the European CHIPS Act.\n\n50:40.620 --> 50:43.700\n The United States CHIPS Act's about $52 billion.\n\n50:43.700 --> 50:45.900\n The European's about 43.\n\n50:45.900 --> 50:49.900\n Their goal combined is to get at least 50%\n\n50:49.900 --> 50:54.340\n of the consumption with manufacturing installed\n\n50:54.340 --> 50:57.260\n within the US and European geographies.\n\n50:57.260 --> 50:58.340\n And that's also very good.\n\n50:58.340 --> 51:03.180\n That's yet another incentive for more manufacturing capacity\n\n51:03.180 --> 51:05.300\n to be built and to be built\n\n51:05.300 --> 51:08.300\n with a geographic distributed way,\n\n51:08.300 --> 51:09.980\n which that's how you plan supply chain.\n\n51:09.980 --> 51:12.420\n So those I think are good things.\n\n51:12.420 --> 51:16.060\n So if anything we learn through the crisis\n\n51:16.060 --> 51:19.420\n is that semiconductor is important.\n\n51:19.420 --> 51:21.380\n Semiconductor companies are important\n\n51:21.380 --> 51:23.860\n and we need to invest in semiconductors.\n\n51:23.860 --> 51:26.140\n We're turning to the grilling of the CEO\n\n51:26.140 --> 51:28.140\n with the hard questions.\n\n51:28.140 --> 51:30.580\n This is almost from my own education of the space.\n\n51:30.580 --> 51:32.220\n You mentioned regulators.\n\n51:32.220 --> 51:34.300\n Qualcomm paid out and received payment\n\n51:34.300 --> 51:37.020\n of billions of dollars in settlement and fines.\n\n51:38.060 --> 51:40.620\n There seems to be a lot of huge lawsuits in this space.\n\n51:40.620 --> 51:42.260\n How do you explain that?\n\n51:42.260 --> 51:45.260\n Does this get in the way of innovation\n\n51:45.260 --> 51:46.860\n or does it promote it?\n\n51:46.860 --> 51:50.620\n I will rephrase it by saying there used to be a lot\n\n51:50.620 --> 51:51.940\n of lawsuits in this space.\n\n51:51.940 --> 51:56.940\n In addition of what we do in semiconductors,\n\n51:56.940 --> 52:00.980\n our processors and our modems, the Snapdragon platform,\n\n52:02.780 --> 52:04.660\n we also have a licensing business,\n\n52:04.660 --> 52:08.060\n which has been a part of the company since the beginning.\n\n52:08.060 --> 52:13.060\n As the largest inventors of the essential technology\n\n52:14.020 --> 52:18.340\n in 2G, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 5G,\n\n52:19.620 --> 52:21.820\n and Qualcomm contribute that to the standards.\n\n52:21.820 --> 52:25.740\n So we always had this model that rather than invent\n\n52:25.740 --> 52:27.980\n the technology and be the only one producing the products,\n\n52:27.980 --> 52:30.300\n we license so everyone can produce it.\n\n52:31.940 --> 52:35.060\n And as such, we receive intellectual property\n\n52:35.940 --> 52:38.340\n for the standard essential patents.\n\n52:40.580 --> 52:44.420\n As part of our past dispute with Apple,\n\n52:44.420 --> 52:46.220\n that's behind us now.\n\n52:46.220 --> 52:47.260\n Your friends now.\n\n52:47.260 --> 52:49.620\n They're my customers.\n\n52:49.620 --> 52:54.580\n And as part of that, I think the licensing model\n\n52:54.580 --> 52:58.580\n got tested, I think, in every geography.\n\n52:58.580 --> 53:02.100\n And we succeeded in every single geography\n\n53:02.100 --> 53:06.780\n to validate the pro competitiveness of this model.\n\n53:06.780 --> 53:09.540\n I think the fair, reasonable,\n\n53:09.540 --> 53:12.260\n non discriminatory aspect of this model.\n\n53:12.260 --> 53:16.420\n And I would argue that besides being the most successful\n\n53:16.420 --> 53:19.860\n licensing business to date in the industry,\n\n53:19.860 --> 53:21.980\n probably the one that's been battle tested\n\n53:21.980 --> 53:25.020\n and is most stable because there's not a single\n\n53:25.020 --> 53:29.060\n jurisdiction that we have not had to validate that model.\n\n53:29.060 --> 53:32.180\n So it's part of our past and what it creates\n\n53:32.180 --> 53:34.220\n is probably create a lot of stability\n\n53:34.220 --> 53:35.220\n in our licensing business.\n\n53:35.220 --> 53:38.300\n But having said that, the growth of the company\n\n53:38.300 --> 53:40.260\n is in the semiconductor space.\n\n53:40.260 --> 53:43.300\n And the semiconductor, so licensing is,\n\n53:43.300 --> 53:44.860\n you come up with a pretty good idea,\n\n53:44.860 --> 53:48.100\n you have a bunch of smart people coming up with cool ideas,\n\n53:48.100 --> 53:49.900\n and then once you come up with that idea,\n\n53:49.900 --> 53:52.340\n you sell that idea to others, they get to use it.\n\n53:52.340 --> 53:53.900\n That's essentially what a license.\n\n53:53.900 --> 53:58.060\n The license revenue we have is for the,\n\n53:58.060 --> 54:02.180\n what we call the SCP, standard essential patents,\n\n54:02.180 --> 54:07.180\n that are part of the 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G standards.\n\n54:07.620 --> 54:10.860\n So if you want to build anything with 5G,\n\n54:10.860 --> 54:13.500\n you need to get a license from Qualcomm\n\n54:13.500 --> 54:16.860\n because it uses Qualcomm essential technology\n\n54:16.860 --> 54:17.940\n as part of the standard.\n\n54:17.940 --> 54:19.580\n And a slightly different model,\n\n54:19.580 --> 54:22.100\n or a lot different model with the semiconductor\n\n54:22.100 --> 54:25.820\n is you design, you inject a bunch of fascinating ideas,\n\n54:25.820 --> 54:28.220\n how to build the Snapdragon, and then there's,\n\n54:28.220 --> 54:29.820\n because it's a fabulous company,\n\n54:29.820 --> 54:33.580\n you have somebody build the chip\n\n54:33.580 --> 54:35.460\n and then goes into a phone with the branding\n\n54:35.460 --> 54:36.740\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n54:36.740 --> 54:40.100\n And that has less kind of players involved,\n\n54:40.100 --> 54:40.940\n it's not a license.\n\n54:40.940 --> 54:42.340\n We sell the product.\n\n54:42.340 --> 54:45.420\n We don't license semiconductor technology,\n\n54:45.420 --> 54:47.660\n we build products and we sell products.\n\n54:49.460 --> 54:51.620\n This is your first year as a CEO.\n\n54:51.620 --> 54:52.940\n Not one year yet.\n\n54:52.940 --> 54:54.060\n Not one year yet.\n\n54:56.100 --> 54:58.300\n Let's hope it'll be in June, it'll be one year.\n\n54:58.300 --> 54:59.140\n Okay.\n\n55:00.100 --> 55:04.060\n This is a company that's involved\n\n55:04.060 --> 55:06.220\n with a lot of fascinating technologies\n\n55:06.220 --> 55:09.540\n and it's touching the lives of billions of people.\n\n55:09.540 --> 55:11.260\n A lot of complicated stuff.\n\n55:11.260 --> 55:13.460\n Like I said, licensing technologies.\n\n55:13.460 --> 55:17.460\n You have to collaborate with manufacturers.\n\n55:17.460 --> 55:20.020\n You have to then work with, however many you said,\n\n55:20.020 --> 55:23.460\n car companies and all these clients and so on.\n\n55:23.460 --> 55:28.460\n And you have to, with tech companies, Apple and so on.\n\n55:29.500 --> 55:30.460\n What's that like?\n\n55:30.460 --> 55:33.060\n What lessons have you learned about leadership\n\n55:33.060 --> 55:35.100\n and maybe about yourself as a human being\n\n55:35.100 --> 55:39.460\n from this first, almost a year, soon to be a year\n\n55:39.460 --> 55:42.060\n as a CEO of this incredible, this complex,\n\n55:42.060 --> 55:43.500\n this large company?\n\n55:43.500 --> 55:44.540\n That's a loaded question.\n\n55:44.540 --> 55:47.820\n Let me answer in reverse order.\n\n55:47.820 --> 55:51.260\n First thing that I learned, and I think it's probably common\n\n55:52.380 --> 55:55.380\n across CEOs, especially in our industry,\n\n55:55.380 --> 55:58.220\n is it will be great if I had more time.\n\n55:59.300 --> 56:01.860\n I think there's, especially because we grow\n\n56:01.860 --> 56:04.180\n in so many areas and there's so many things to learn,\n\n56:04.180 --> 56:08.420\n so many relationships to build, time to spend\n\n56:08.420 --> 56:10.380\n with a number of different technologies.\n\n56:11.700 --> 56:14.100\n But it kind of reflects really the size\n\n56:14.100 --> 56:16.180\n of the opportunity that exists for Qualcomm.\n\n56:16.180 --> 56:19.060\n Qualcomm, it is really growing in a number\n\n56:19.060 --> 56:22.060\n of different directions all at the same time.\n\n56:22.060 --> 56:25.860\n And so it did got busier.\n\n56:25.860 --> 56:29.820\n And part of this is because I'm spending a lot of time\n\n56:29.820 --> 56:32.740\n understanding the new industries we're going in\n\n56:32.740 --> 56:35.620\n and building relationships.\n\n56:35.620 --> 56:37.380\n Second thing, which is a lot to do\n\n56:37.380 --> 56:39.340\n with how I think about things\n\n56:39.340 --> 56:41.580\n and a little bit of my personality.\n\n56:41.580 --> 56:44.460\n At the end of the day, business partnerships\n\n56:44.460 --> 56:46.940\n are really done by people.\n\n56:46.940 --> 56:51.380\n And I think the importance of having trusted relationships\n\n56:51.380 --> 56:54.860\n for the long term is extremely important.\n\n56:54.860 --> 56:57.380\n And I've been dedicated to do that as CEO.\n\n56:57.380 --> 57:01.020\n We're not a company that plays for the short term.\n\n57:01.020 --> 57:01.860\n We don't.\n\n57:01.860 --> 57:03.780\n And when we build new partnerships,\n\n57:03.780 --> 57:05.980\n we expect that to be for decades.\n\n57:05.980 --> 57:09.420\n And so I spend time doing that\n\n57:09.420 --> 57:11.260\n and think that's important for Qualcomm.\n\n57:11.260 --> 57:15.100\n The other part of your question is,\n\n57:15.100 --> 57:18.900\n we do have a lot of opportunities in all different areas.\n\n57:18.900 --> 57:21.540\n What we like, and I've been fortunate enough\n\n57:21.540 --> 57:23.780\n to become CEO at a time,\n\n57:23.780 --> 57:27.180\n that a lot of the trends are pointing to our technology.\n\n57:27.180 --> 57:28.220\n We talk about some of them.\n\n57:28.220 --> 57:31.300\n We talk about merger of physical and digital spaces.\n\n57:31.300 --> 57:33.500\n We talk about the transformation of the automobile.\n\n57:33.500 --> 57:38.500\n We talk about the merge of computing and mobile,\n\n57:38.820 --> 57:40.580\n the enterprise transformation of the home.\n\n57:40.580 --> 57:42.380\n There are many of those trends.\n\n57:42.380 --> 57:46.140\n And those trends create opportunities for Qualcomm\n\n57:46.140 --> 57:50.820\n to be providing technology first.\n\n57:50.820 --> 57:53.660\n And as such, we're in a hurry.\n\n57:53.660 --> 57:55.420\n So I'm in a little bit of a hurry\n\n57:55.420 --> 57:57.700\n because I think the opportunity is incredible\n\n57:57.700 --> 58:02.620\n for technology, but having fun and enjoying the job.\n\n58:02.620 --> 58:04.780\n Is there a burden because of so much\n\n58:04.780 --> 58:07.300\n of what you said is partnerships\n\n58:07.300 --> 58:09.820\n and almost like friendships,\n\n58:09.820 --> 58:12.300\n connections with other human beings?\n\n58:12.300 --> 58:15.620\n Me as an introvert that has a lot of social anxiety,\n\n58:15.620 --> 58:17.180\n that seems extremely stressful.\n\n58:17.180 --> 58:19.340\n So is there that burden on your shoulders?\n\n58:19.340 --> 58:21.180\n You have to wake up every day\n\n58:21.180 --> 58:25.940\n and talk to friends you've had for many years.\n\n58:25.940 --> 58:28.660\n It can be, and then convince them\n\n58:28.660 --> 58:31.060\n and make partnerships with them,\n\n58:31.060 --> 58:33.700\n talk with them, describe to them the future,\n\n58:33.700 --> 58:36.100\n sell them an idea, and then yourself grow\n\n58:36.100 --> 58:37.360\n because you don't know what the heck\n\n58:37.360 --> 58:38.500\n the future is gonna be like.\n\n58:38.500 --> 58:41.000\n And you have to project both confidence and humility,\n\n58:41.000 --> 58:42.220\n all those kinds of things.\n\n58:42.220 --> 58:43.240\n Is that exhausting?\n\n58:45.100 --> 58:48.680\n It is exhausting, but it's something I do like to do.\n\n58:48.680 --> 58:50.540\n And it's not only with partners, really.\n\n58:50.540 --> 58:54.100\n It's also internally to your employees, I think,\n\n58:54.100 --> 58:55.440\n to get alignment on the vision\n\n58:55.440 --> 58:57.680\n and faith in the vision and execute.\n\n58:57.680 --> 58:59.100\n And at the end of the day, we're very fortunate.\n\n58:59.100 --> 59:00.200\n We have a lot of smart people.\n\n59:00.200 --> 59:02.100\n So people, if they're aligned with the vision,\n\n59:02.100 --> 59:03.460\n they know what to do.\n\n59:03.460 --> 59:05.300\n And then, of course, as CEO,\n\n59:05.300 --> 59:06.860\n you have to convince your investors\n\n59:06.860 --> 59:09.060\n that that's the right idea as well.\n\n59:09.940 --> 59:13.980\n If you can put on your wise sage hat,\n\n59:13.980 --> 59:16.100\n do you have a device for young people\n\n59:16.100 --> 59:18.540\n in high school and college?\n\n59:18.540 --> 59:23.300\n You yourself started from the humble beginnings in Brazil,\n\n59:24.780 --> 59:28.860\n maybe a bit of a wild, risky decision to go to Japan,\n\n59:28.860 --> 59:30.820\n and now are the head of one of the biggest,\n\n59:30.820 --> 59:34.100\n most successful, most impactful companies in the world.\n\n59:34.100 --> 59:37.980\n Given that story, can you give advice to young people today\n\n59:37.980 --> 59:41.180\n that they can have a career\n\n59:41.180 --> 59:43.020\n or just a life they can be proud of?\n\n59:43.980 --> 59:45.420\n I think the first thing,\n\n59:45.420 --> 59:47.740\n and of course, all of those answers\n\n59:47.740 --> 59:52.140\n are gonna relate to my own experience, right?\n\n59:52.140 --> 59:56.940\n The first thing is it always worked for me\n\n59:56.940 --> 1:00:00.980\n to have a plan, even if the plan\n\n1:00:00.980 --> 1:00:02.760\n is just what I'm gonna do in the next two years,\n\n1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.260\n but what do I want to do?\n\n1:00:04.260 --> 1:00:05.960\n Where do I wanna go?\n\n1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:08.480\n And I think it's important for people,\n\n1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:09.780\n especially young people,\n\n1:00:10.780 --> 1:00:15.140\n is to really have a dream and go pursue it.\n\n1:00:15.140 --> 1:00:17.560\n I mean, have a dream does not go back to bed to sleep.\n\n1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:20.720\n It's really what do you want to accomplish\n\n1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:22.300\n and then what it's gonna take to do that.\n\n1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:24.200\n And then believe in yourself.\n\n1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:27.600\n Like I said, I joined Qualcomm as an engineer\n\n1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:33.140\n and I didn't have any plans when I joined to be CEO,\n\n1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:34.680\n but I do want, as an engineer,\n\n1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.240\n what I wanted to do, where I wanna contribute,\n\n1:00:38.240 --> 1:00:39.320\n what I wanted to work on,\n\n1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:43.800\n and then keep evolving from that point in time.\n\n1:00:43.800 --> 1:00:46.200\n The other thing is, this is an advice,\n\n1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:51.200\n it's more of like career advice that I got early in my career\n\n1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:54.020\n was extremely helpful for me\n\n1:00:54.020 --> 1:00:55.160\n and I will give that advice\n\n1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:56.760\n to everyone that is interested.\n\n1:00:58.740 --> 1:01:02.540\n Spend time understanding what are the things you're good at\n\n1:01:02.540 --> 1:01:04.280\n and what are the things you're not.\n\n1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:08.680\n Like what is the real border between your area of competence\n\n1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:10.580\n and your area of incompetence?\n\n1:01:10.580 --> 1:01:12.320\n And once you see that,\n\n1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:15.680\n once you see that you know exactly what you have to work on\n\n1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:18.880\n and you can say, that's where I wanna go next,\n\n1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:21.160\n this is the gap, I need to do it.\n\n1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:24.760\n And it's faster when you can identify yourself\n\n1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:27.240\n before other people can tell you.\n\n1:01:27.240 --> 1:01:31.480\n Then it leads to automatically the next step.\n\n1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:34.080\n Surround yourself, the people that are very good\n\n1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:35.480\n at the things that you're not.\n\n1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:38.780\n So you have to be radically honest\n\n1:01:38.780 --> 1:01:41.120\n about the things that you're not good at,\n\n1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:42.960\n but given what you're passionate about,\n\n1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:44.160\n you need to get good at,\n\n1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:45.720\n or you would like to get good at,\n\n1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:47.680\n and surround yourself by those people.\n\n1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:50.640\n How often did the plans you make actually work out?\n\n1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:52.520\n So you said it's important to make plans.\n\n1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:54.480\n You didn't say anything about\n\n1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:56.240\n it's important to execute on those plans.\n\n1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:58.600\n More than 50% success rate.\n\n1:01:58.600 --> 1:01:59.960\n Try to keep it above 50.\n\n1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:01.840\n Try to keep it above 50.\n\n1:02:01.840 --> 1:02:05.440\n What was the whole, why did you end up in Japan?\n\n1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.560\n I've been fortunate enough to work in cellular and wireless\n\n1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:10.720\n my entire career.\n\n1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:13.880\n So I always liked communications.\n\n1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:15.680\n When I entered engineering school,\n\n1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.320\n my dad was electrical engineer,\n\n1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:19.120\n but he worked with the utility company.\n\n1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.480\n He wanted me to graduate\n\n1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:23.040\n in traditional electrical engineering,\n\n1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:26.020\n like energy generation, distribution.\n\n1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:29.520\n But I like electronics communication,\n\n1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.720\n so I ended up doing both.\n\n1:02:31.720 --> 1:02:35.280\n And I always liked communication.\n\n1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:37.160\n I was fascinated by wireless communication.\n\n1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:38.680\n So my first job at a college,\n\n1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:42.000\n I started working for a Japanese company down in Brazil,\n\n1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.240\n was NEC, and within about a year in,\n\n1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:46.560\n they transferred me to Tokyo.\n\n1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:48.060\n They asked me to go to their headquarters,\n\n1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:51.440\n and it was the first time I left Brazil.\n\n1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:53.400\n A little bit different from Brazil.\n\n1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:54.920\n Culturally. Very different.\n\n1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:57.120\n It is in the other side of the planet.\n\n1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:00.540\n And that's how I started.\n\n1:03:00.540 --> 1:03:02.840\n You said your father's an electrical engineer.\n\n1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:07.580\n Do you think what you're doing now makes your father proud?\n\n1:03:07.580 --> 1:03:08.680\n I think he's very proud.\n\n1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.420\n I think especially, you know,\n\n1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:15.760\n he tells me that I'm still the same person\n\n1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:17.480\n that never changed.\n\n1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:19.160\n Does he give you advice?\n\n1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:20.720\n Does he criticize what you're doing?\n\n1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:22.360\n Tell you how to improve?\n\n1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:24.080\n My mom and dad still give me advice today.\n\n1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:25.280\n I'm very fortunate for that.\n\n1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:29.560\n But he's proud.\n\n1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:32.240\n I'm also proud because there are very few Brazilians\n\n1:03:33.720 --> 1:03:36.320\n that have achieved a position as CEO\n\n1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.360\n of a company the size of Qualcomm.\n\n1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:43.260\n And I do know that also I carry a burden,\n\n1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:47.720\n especially for the Latino community,\n\n1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:49.220\n to be an inspiration for them\n\n1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:51.940\n and make sure I set a good example.\n\n1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:54.380\n So not just your mom and dad,\n\n1:03:54.380 --> 1:03:59.380\n but the culture, the people that were originally your home.\n\n1:04:01.540 --> 1:04:03.860\n Do you, you know, life is finite.\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:06.680\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n1:04:07.860 --> 1:04:10.980\n Look, I'm a devout Christian,\n\n1:04:10.980 --> 1:04:14.580\n and so I'm a big believer that there's,\n\n1:04:15.460 --> 1:04:16.920\n this is just a transition.\n\n1:04:18.700 --> 1:04:22.140\n But don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.\n\n1:04:22.140 --> 1:04:25.820\n I am somebody good, better, and different\n\n1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:29.340\n that try as much as possible to leave the present,\n\n1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:30.380\n and that's what I do.\n\n1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:33.240\n And try to make the present better\n\n1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:35.860\n on this place here on Earth.\n\n1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:36.700\n Absolutely.\n\n1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:38.060\n And that some of these technologies,\n\n1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:40.980\n some of these ideas are kind of a different kind\n\n1:04:40.980 --> 1:04:42.540\n of immortality as well,\n\n1:04:42.540 --> 1:04:44.500\n because they propagate through time\n\n1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:47.700\n and have impact on people in the best possible way.\n\n1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:49.880\n So technology can be scary,\n\n1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:51.280\n technology can be destructive,\n\n1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:56.280\n but it seems like in the end it can do a lot of good.\n\n1:04:56.460 --> 1:04:59.300\n More good, there's more good than bad.\n\n1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:01.100\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n1:05:01.100 --> 1:05:03.620\n I asked you about aliens observing us.\n\n1:05:03.620 --> 1:05:05.640\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:09.640\n Cristiano, what's the meaning of life?\n\n1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:10.920\n Easy questions.\n\n1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:13.120\n That's not an easy question at all.\n\n1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:15.240\n I think that's a question,\n\n1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.640\n at least for me, you have to answer individually.\n\n1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:21.860\n But I do believe we're all here for a purpose.\n\n1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:28.960\n In my prayers I always ask that I stay on track\n\n1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:30.960\n to whatever my purpose is,\n\n1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:33.160\n but I do believe we're here for a purpose,\n\n1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:34.840\n and we need to do the best we can\n\n1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:36.920\n during the time we have on this Earth.\n\n1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:41.040\n So that means create beautiful things for you\n\n1:05:41.040 --> 1:05:42.000\n as an engineer?\n\n1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.640\n Yes, and create beautiful things, yes.\n\n1:05:44.640 --> 1:05:46.280\n What about love?\n\n1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:48.780\n What's the role of love in the human condition?\n\n1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:50.960\n Love's very important,\n\n1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:54.740\n and it's an essential part of being human.\n\n1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:56.880\n It comes in the package.\n\n1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.100\n And I think if you look at the situation,\n\n1:06:00.100 --> 1:06:01.480\n what's happening right now,\n\n1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:03.680\n I think if you look at the situation\n\n1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:06.280\n with some of the underprivileged communities,\n\n1:06:06.280 --> 1:06:08.180\n you look at the homeless situation,\n\n1:06:08.180 --> 1:06:10.200\n I think we all need more love.\n\n1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:12.680\n Yeah, and I think people that build incredible technology\n\n1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:14.880\n sometimes forget the love part.\n\n1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:17.280\n Those are all, it's all integrated.\n\n1:06:17.280 --> 1:06:21.720\n There's no, thinking about humanity is really important\n\n1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:24.980\n when you build tools that empower that humanity.\n\n1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:27.360\n Because there's, I think, at least I personally believe\n\n1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:30.200\n we're all capable of both evil and good.\n\n1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:33.400\n And we have to build technology, build societies,\n\n1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.200\n build governments, build communities\n\n1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:40.000\n that inspire us to connect with the good part\n\n1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:40.940\n within all of us.\n\n1:06:40.940 --> 1:06:43.760\n I'm a big believer that technology is, at the end,\n\n1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:44.720\n the force for good.\n\n1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:47.560\n And if you just look, you know,\n\n1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:50.880\n not trying to move away from a deep discussion\n\n1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:54.180\n to a more specific, technical one.\n\n1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:58.640\n But we started a conversation talking about smartphones.\n\n1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:03.240\n And smartphones really, the first time\n\n1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:05.240\n that you could say that everybody in the world\n\n1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:06.960\n was able to connect to the internet\n\n1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:07.880\n and connect to each other.\n\n1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:11.400\n And I think what that empowerment that that provided,\n\n1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:13.240\n it's an incredible force for good.\n\n1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:18.660\n Well, the company you lead, the technology you've created,\n\n1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:21.120\n one of them that I'm especially excited about,\n\n1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:23.840\n which is Snapdragon, the whole line of processors there.\n\n1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:27.600\n Currently, I would say at about 10 billion transistors.\n\n1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:29.200\n If you think about the human brain,\n\n1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:31.560\n it's about 100 billion neurons.\n\n1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:36.440\n So I think 11 Samsung Galaxy S22s\n\n1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:37.720\n are already smarter than me.\n\n1:07:37.720 --> 1:07:41.040\n And that's being nice to me.\n\n1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:42.240\n I'm really honored that you spent\n\n1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:44.680\n your extremely valuable time with me,\n\n1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:47.120\n even though you said Pele is the favorite player.\n\n1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:51.360\n Beyond all of that, I think you're an incredible person,\n\n1:07:51.360 --> 1:07:53.240\n incredible leader, and you lead\n\n1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:54.860\n an incredible engineering company.\n\n1:07:54.860 --> 1:07:55.980\n So thank you for doing that.\n\n1:07:55.980 --> 1:07:56.820\n Oh, thank you so much.\n\n1:07:56.820 --> 1:07:58.020\n Thanks for the kind words.\n\n1:07:58.020 --> 1:07:59.920\n Really a pleasure having this conversation.\n\n1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:01.340\n I really had a lot of fun doing it.\n\n1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:03.900\n And thank you for having me in your podcast.\n\n1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.280\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:08:06.280 --> 1:08:07.960\n with Christiano Aman.\n\n1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:09.640\n To support this podcast, please check out\n\n1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:11.760\n our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:13.920\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:15.100\n from Stephen Hawking.\n\n1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:20.420\n For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals.\n\n1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:22.480\n Then something happened, which unleashed\n\n1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.760\n the power of our imagination.\n\n1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:28.120\n We learned to talk, and we learned to listen.\n\n1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:31.360\n Speech has allowed the communication of ideas,\n\n1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:33.440\n enabling human beings to work together\n\n1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:35.400\n to build the impossible.\n\n1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:40.080\n Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking,\n\n1:08:40.080 --> 1:08:43.080\n and its greatest failures by not talking.\n\n1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:46.040\n It doesn't have to be like this.\n\n1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.280\n Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future.\n\n1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:51.280\n With the technology at our disposal,\n\n1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:54.200\n the possibilities are unbounded.\n\n1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:58.440\n All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.\n\n1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:25.440\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
