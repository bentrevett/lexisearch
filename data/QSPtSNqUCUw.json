--> 00:08.980\n that I had the great fortune of talking to\n\n00:08.980 --> 00:10.600\n on a recent afternoon.\n\n00:10.600 --> 00:13.700\n He happens to be Eric Weinstein's son,\n\n00:13.700 --> 00:15.780\n but I invited Zev not because of that,\n\n00:15.780 --> 00:17.780\n but because I got a chance to listen to him speak\n\n00:17.780 --> 00:20.540\n on a few occasions and was captivated\n\n00:20.540 --> 00:22.900\n by how deeply he thought about this world\n\n00:22.900 --> 00:24.340\n at such a young age.\n\n00:24.340 --> 00:25.960\n And I thought that it might be fun\n\n00:25.960 --> 00:29.160\n to explore this world of ours together with him\n\n00:29.160 --> 00:31.820\n for a time through this conversation.\n\n00:31.820 --> 00:33.500\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n00:33.500 --> 00:37.160\n ExpressVPN, Grammarly Grammar Assistant,\n\n00:37.160 --> 00:39.020\n Simply Safe Home Security,\n\n00:39.020 --> 00:41.820\n and Magic Spoon Low Carb Cereal.\n\n00:41.820 --> 00:46.180\n So the choice is privacy, grammar, safety or health.\n\n00:46.180 --> 00:47.580\n Choose wisely, my friends.\n\n00:47.580 --> 00:49.980\n And if you wish, click

00:59.980\n the fear associated with participating in public discourse\n\n00:59.980 --> 01:03.140\n and is brave enough to join in at a young age,\n\n01:03.140 --> 01:05.820\n to push forward, to change his mind publicly,\n\n01:05.820 --> 01:09.300\n to learn, to articulate difficult nuanced ideas\n\n01:09.300 --> 01:11.900\n and grow from the conversations that follow.\n\n01:11.900 --> 01:15.100\n In this, I hope he leads the next generation of minds\n\n01:15.100 --> 01:18.100\n that is joining and steering the collective intelligence\n\n01:18.100 --> 01:21.100\n of this big ant colony we think of\n\n01:21.100 --> 01:23.460\n as our human civilization.\n\n01:23.460 --> 01:25.900\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:25.900 --> 01:29.060\n review it on Apple

conversation with Zev Weinstein.\n\n01:38.900 --> 01:42.180\n You've said that philosophy becomes more dangerous\n\n01:42.180 --> 01:43.540\n in difficult times.\n\n01:43.540 --> 01:44.740\n What do you mean by that?\n\n01:44.740 --> 01:48.460\n Interestingly, I think I mean two things by that.\n\n01:48.460 --> 01:51.420\n And I think firstly, I should clarify,\n\n01:51.420 --> 01:53.600\n when I say philosophy, I sort of mean\n\n01:53.600 --> 01:58.600\n in a very traditional sense, just thinking, ideation.\n\n01:58.740 --> 02:03.200\n And that could be reconsidering our notions of self\n\n02:03.200 --> 02:06.620\n in a very traditional sense, which we consider philosophy,\n\n02:06.620 --> 02:10.740\n or that could be like technological innovation.\n\n02:10.740 --> 02:13.100\n I think it's important to recognize all of these\n\n02:13.100 --> 02:16.540\n as philosophies that we can not question\n\n02:16.540 --> 02:18.840\n whether it's important to promote thought.\n\n02:18.840 --> 02:21.100\n I think the other thing I should clarify\n\n02:21.100 --> 02:23.180\n is when I say difficult times,\n\n02:23.180 --> 02:25.980\n I mean times when nothing is growing,\n\n02:25.980 --> 02:30.980\n and so the risk for real conflict is much greater\n\n02:31.260 --> 02:34.860\n because people are incentivized to fight over the things\n\n02:34.860 --> 02:37.240\n which already exist.\n\n02:37.240 --> 02:41.060\n I think when times are not difficult,\n\n02:41.900 --> 02:44.540\n the people with the greatest power\n\n02:44.540 --> 02:47.620\n are usually the people who are very creative,\n\n02:47.620 --> 02:50.820\n generating a lot, and that really requires ideation\n\n02:50.820 --> 02:53.420\n or philosophy of some sort.\n\n02:53.420 --> 02:56.660\n I think when times become stagnant,\n\n02:56.660 --> 03:00.740\n the important successful people become the people\n\n03:00.740 --> 03:04.380\n who are very good at protecting their own pieces of the pie\n\n03:04.380 --> 03:05.840\n and taking others.\n\n03:07.900 --> 03:11.700\n I think that those people have to be very opposed\n\n03:11.700 --> 03:16.140\n to any sort of thinking that could restructure society\n\n03:16.140 --> 03:21.140\n or conventions about who should succeed.\n\n03:21.940 --> 03:25.220\n And so firstly, I mean by that\n\n03:25.220 --> 03:30.220\n that it becomes much more dangerous for a person\n\n03:31.020 --> 03:35.320\n to think deeply and question during a time\n\n03:35.320 --> 03:38.620\n when the important people are those concerned\n\n03:38.620 --> 03:41.540\n with making sure no one rocks the boat.\n\n03:41.540 --> 03:45.660\n One example of this would be Socrates and his execution\n\n03:45.660 --> 03:47.500\n because everyone was happy enough\n\n03:47.500 --> 03:50.740\n to sit through his questions before there was war\n\n03:50.740 --> 03:52.100\n and poverty and distress,\n\n03:52.100 --> 03:54.540\n and afterwards it just became too dangerous.\n\n03:54.540 --> 03:58.660\n The other thing I mean by that is that the consequences\n\n03:58.660 --> 04:03.140\n of thinking deeply carry much greater potential\n\n04:03.140 --> 04:06.940\n for real catastrophe when everyone is desperate.\n\n04:06.940 --> 04:11.820\n So like for example, the communist manifesto\n\n04:11.820 --> 04:16.820\n was probably much more dangerous during early 1900s Russia\n\n04:16.900 --> 04:19.780\n than it was during the 1848 revolutions\n\n04:19.780 --> 04:22.860\n because I think people were in much worse shape\n\n04:24.300 --> 04:27.460\n and desperate people are very willing to dive\n\n04:27.460 --> 04:30.960\n into anything new that might bring the future\n\n04:30.960 --> 04:33.300\n without fully calculating\n\n04:33.300 --> 04:36.560\n whatever the consequences or risks might be.\n\n04:36.560 --> 04:39.120\n So it is both more dangerous for a person\n\n04:39.120 --> 04:42.300\n to have creative ideas and those ideas\n\n04:42.300 --> 04:46.960\n are more dangerous when times are tough.\n\n04:46.960 --> 04:51.100\n And by dangerous you mean it challenges the people\n\n04:51.100 --> 04:55.080\n with power who want to maintain that power\n\n04:55.080 --> 04:59.400\n in times of stagnation when there's not much growth,\n\n04:59.400 --> 05:01.820\n innovation, creativity, all that kind of stuff.\n\n05:01.820 --> 05:06.220\n Right, and we know that if nothing new is created,\n\n05:06.220 --> 05:10.220\n people have promises that they've made\n\n05:10.220 --> 05:14.460\n about what will be paid to whom, what debt structure is.\n\n05:14.460 --> 05:19.460\n The only possibility if stagnation lasts for long enough\n\n05:20.980 --> 05:24.300\n is really some kind of great conflict, great war\n\n05:24.300 --> 05:25.940\n because people have to take from others\n\n05:25.940 --> 05:28.740\n to make good on their own promises.\n\n05:28.740 --> 05:33.740\n So we know that by denying any sort of grand ideation\n\n05:33.740 --> 05:36.940\n we are accepting that there will be\n\n05:36.940 --> 05:39.820\n some kind of great catastrophe.\n\n05:39.820 --> 05:42.820\n And so we have to understand that philosophy\n\n05:42.820 --> 05:47.340\n is the most important when we've seen\n\n05:47.340 --> 05:49.580\n too much stagnation for too long.\n\n05:49.580 --> 05:53.220\n It is also very dangerous\n\n05:53.220 --> 05:55.180\n and it's dangerous for the people who are doing it\n\n05:55.180 --> 05:57.980\n and it's dangerous for the people who believe it\n\n05:57.980 --> 06:00.300\n but it's kind of our only way out ever.\n\n06:00.300 --> 06:03.820\n And again, by philosophy you mean the bigger,\n\n06:03.820 --> 06:05.220\n so it's not academic philosophy\n\n06:05.220 --> 06:08.900\n or this kind of games played in the space\n\n06:08.900 --> 06:12.140\n of just like moral philosophy and all those metaphysics,\n\n06:12.140 --> 06:12.980\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n06:12.980 --> 06:15.660\n You mean just thinking deeply about this world,\n\n06:15.660 --> 06:17.580\n thinking from first principles.\n\n06:17.580 --> 06:22.100\n I think your like Twitter line involves something about like.\n\n06:22.100 --> 06:24.820\n Trying to piece everything together from first principles.\n\n06:24.820 --> 06:27.780\n So that's fundamentally what being philosophical\n\n06:27.780 --> 06:31.180\n about this world is and that's where the people\n\n06:31.180 --> 06:33.180\n who are thinking deeply about this world\n\n06:33.180 --> 06:36.100\n are the ones who are feeding,\n\n06:36.100 --> 06:39.220\n who are the catalyst of this growth in society and so on.\n\n06:39.220 --> 06:43.060\n Yeah, I mean, I also think that the real implication\n\n06:43.060 --> 06:48.060\n of moral philosophy can be something\n\n06:48.140 --> 06:52.660\n that most would consider like a real political implication.\n\n06:52.660 --> 06:55.980\n So I think all philosophy really ties together\n\n06:55.980 --> 06:58.860\n because there has to be some sort of grand structure\n\n06:58.860 --> 07:01.780\n to all thought and how it relates.\n\n07:01.780 --> 07:06.780\n Do you think this growth and innovation\n\n07:06.780 --> 07:10.300\n and improvement can last forever?\n\n07:10.300 --> 07:12.480\n We've seen some incredible,\n\n07:14.020 --> 07:16.020\n the thing that humans have been able to accomplish\n\n07:16.020 --> 07:20.260\n over the past several hundred years is just,\n\n07:20.260 --> 07:24.940\n I mean, awe inspiring and every moment in that history,\n\n07:24.940 --> 07:27.820\n it almost seemed like no more could be done.\n\n07:27.820 --> 07:30.900\n Like we've solved all the problems that are to be solved.\n\n07:30.900 --> 07:32.500\n And there's just historically,\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:34.100\n there's all these kind of ridiculous\n\n07:34.100 --> 07:35.980\n like Bill Gates style quotes,\n\n07:35.980 --> 07:40.380\n or like it's obvious that this new cool thing\n\n07:40.380 --> 07:43.420\n is not gonna take off and yet it does.\n\n07:43.420 --> 07:47.180\n And so there's a feeling of the same kind of pattern\n\n07:47.180 --> 07:48.220\n that we see in Moore's law.\n\n07:48.220 --> 07:51.180\n There's constant growth in different technologies\n\n07:51.180 --> 07:54.180\n in the modern day era in any kind of automation\n\n07:54.180 --> 07:55.620\n over the past hundred years.\n\n07:55.620 --> 07:58.980\n Do you think it's possible that we'll keep growing this way\n\n07:58.980 --> 08:02.380\n if we give power to the philosophers of our society?\n\n08:02.380 --> 08:05.420\n I think the only way that we can keep growing this way\n\n08:05.420 --> 08:08.280\n is if we give power to real thinkers.\n\n08:09.180 --> 08:11.140\n And there's no guarantee that that will work,\n\n08:11.140 --> 08:13.800\n but we sort of don't have any other choice.\n\n08:13.800 --> 08:15.380\n And I think you're entirely right\n\n08:15.380 --> 08:20.380\n that this period of both understanding the universe\n\n08:20.380 --> 08:25.140\n at a rate which has never been seen before\n\n08:25.140 --> 08:29.060\n and invention and creativity,\n\n08:29.060 --> 08:31.620\n that these past hundred years\n\n08:31.620 --> 08:33.780\n have been sort of uncharacteristic\n\n08:34.800 --> 08:38.320\n for the level of growth that we've seen in all of history.\n\n08:38.320 --> 08:41.160\n We've never seen anything like this.\n\n08:41.160 --> 08:50.500\n And I think a lot of our promises rest on this sort of thing\n\n08:50.500 --> 08:51.780\n continuing.\n\n08:51.780 --> 08:53.540\n I think that's very dangerous.\n\n08:53.540 --> 08:57.660\n But the one thing that can get us out of this is philosophy\n\n08:57.660 --> 09:01.460\n and being ready to radically restructure\n\n09:01.460 --> 09:05.500\n all of our notions about what should be, what is.\n\n09:05.500 --> 09:06.780\n I think that's very important.\n\n09:06.780 --> 09:08.740\n So you think deeply about this world.\n\n09:08.740 --> 09:11.940\n You are clearly the embodiment of a thinker, of a philosopher.\n\n09:12.940 --> 09:16.080\n Your dad is also one such guy, Eric Weinstein.\n\n09:16.980 --> 09:20.060\n Do you have big disagreements with him\n\n09:20.060 --> 09:21.580\n on this topic in particular?\n\n09:21.580 --> 09:23.980\n I think, now people should know,\n\n09:23.980 --> 09:25.700\n he also happens to be in the room,\n\n09:25.700 --> 09:29.780\n but the mics can't pick him up so he can heckle.\n\n09:29.780 --> 09:30.980\n It doesn't even matter.\n\n09:32.020 --> 09:34.580\n But do you have disagreements with him on this point?\n\n09:34.580 --> 09:37.640\n Let me try to summarize his argument\n\n09:37.640 --> 09:42.640\n that we are actually based a lot of our American society\n\n09:42.900 --> 09:45.660\n on the belief that things will keep growing.\n\n09:45.660 --> 09:50.660\n And yet it seems that however you break it apart,\n\n09:50.660 --> 09:52.860\n maybe from an economics perspective,\n\n09:52.860 --> 09:55.140\n that they're not growing currently.\n\n09:55.140 --> 09:57.660\n And so that's where a lot of our troubles are at.\n\n09:57.660 --> 10:00.860\n Do you have the same sense that there's a stagnation period\n\n10:00.860 --> 10:03.460\n that we're living through over the past couple of decades?\n\n10:03.460 --> 10:07.980\n I think stagnation, modern stagnation is completely\n\n10:07.980 --> 10:11.140\n undeniable, particularly scientifically.\n\n10:11.140 --> 10:13.220\n And I think there have been a few fields\n\n10:13.220 --> 10:17.980\n where tremendous progress has been made very recently.\n\n10:17.980 --> 10:22.140\n I think my dad might feel that\n\n10:24.280 --> 10:26.900\n there is sort of an inevitability\n\n10:26.900 --> 10:29.740\n to the ending of this period.\n\n10:29.740 --> 10:34.740\n And I'm not so certain that the fall of this great time\n\n10:36.900 --> 10:39.700\n is completely inevitable because I don't know\n\n10:39.700 --> 10:42.540\n what thoughts we're capable of producing,\n\n10:42.540 --> 10:45.180\n what we're able to reconsider.\n\n10:45.180 --> 10:49.020\n I think we really have to be open to the possibility\n\n10:49.020 --> 10:53.980\n that all of our standard frameworks where,\n\n10:53.980 --> 10:57.640\n like he will talk about embedded growth obligations.\n\n10:57.640 --> 11:00.420\n If we continue within the same framework,\n\n11:00.420 --> 11:02.180\n then we're very susceptible to the dangers\n\n11:02.180 --> 11:05.220\n of whatever these embedded growth obligations are.\n\n11:05.220 --> 11:06.940\n I think if we break the frameworks,\n\n11:06.940 --> 11:09.060\n we have no reason to believe that the problems\n\n11:09.060 --> 11:11.620\n we're experiencing with our current frameworks\n\n11:11.620 --> 11:13.180\n will follow us.\n\n11:13.180 --> 11:15.520\n And I think that's the importance of radical thought\n\n11:15.520 --> 11:17.900\n is we don't know what the solution is,\n\n11:17.900 --> 11:19.180\n but if there is a solution,\n\n11:19.180 --> 11:22.700\n it will be born from some very fundamental thinking.\n\n11:22.700 --> 11:24.780\n And so I have great hope.\n\n11:24.780 --> 11:27.700\n So you have optimism about sort of the power\n\n11:27.700 --> 11:31.140\n of a single radical idea or a single radical thinker\n\n11:31.140 --> 11:36.140\n to break our frameworks and break us out of this,\n\n11:36.420 --> 11:41.420\n like, spiral down due to whatever the economic forces\n\n11:41.620 --> 11:45.300\n that are creating this current stagnation.\n\n11:45.300 --> 11:47.700\n Yeah, I'm very, very hopeful.\n\n11:47.700 --> 11:48.940\n The optimism of youth.\n\n11:48.940 --> 11:52.060\n Well, I share your optimism.\n\n11:52.060 --> 11:56.100\n So let me come back to something you've also talked about.\n\n11:56.100 --> 11:59.200\n You have very little stuff out there currently,\n\n11:59.200 --> 12:02.620\n but the things you have out there, your thoughts,\n\n12:02.620 --> 12:05.300\n you could just tell how deeply you think about this world.\n\n12:05.300 --> 12:07.620\n And one of the things you mentioned is\n\n12:07.620 --> 12:12.500\n as you learn about this world, as you read,\n\n12:12.500 --> 12:16.040\n as you sort of go through different experiences,\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:20.480\n that you're open to changing your mind.\n\n12:20.480 --> 12:23.840\n How often do you find yourself changing your mind?\n\n12:23.840 --> 12:26.340\n Do you think Zev from 10 years into the future\n\n12:26.340 --> 12:29.020\n will look back at this conversation we're having now\n\n12:29.020 --> 12:33.120\n and disagree completely with everything you just said?\n\n12:33.120 --> 12:34.480\n It's entirely possible.\n\n12:34.480 --> 12:36.840\n And that's one of the things that scares me so much\n\n12:36.840 --> 12:39.400\n about appearing publicly.\n\n12:39.400 --> 12:43.240\n I think that the internet can be very intolerant\n\n12:43.240 --> 12:44.840\n of inconsistency.\n\n12:44.840 --> 12:49.380\n And I am entirely prepared to be very inconsistent\n\n12:49.380 --> 12:54.200\n because I know that whatever beliefs I have\n\n12:54.200 --> 12:56.880\n when subjected to scrutiny may change\n\n12:56.880 --> 12:59.120\n because that's really the only way\n\n12:59.120 --> 13:04.120\n to form your truest, most fundamental conceptions\n\n13:04.400 --> 13:06.640\n about the world around you.\n\n13:06.640 --> 13:09.280\n And it would take an infinite amount of time\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:12.920\n to subject every single one of your beliefs to scrutiny.\n\n13:12.920 --> 13:16.080\n And so that's a process that must follow me\n\n13:16.080 --> 13:18.720\n throughout my entire life.\n\n13:18.720 --> 13:23.560\n And I know that means that my opinions and perspectives\n\n13:23.560 --> 13:26.520\n are always to be changing.\n\n13:28.120 --> 13:31.160\n I'm prepared to accept that about myself.\n\n13:31.160 --> 13:34.840\n Whether other people are prepared to accept\n\n13:34.840 --> 13:39.840\n that my public opinions may change\n\n13:42.320 --> 13:45.960\n and vary greatly over time is something I don't know.\n\n13:45.960 --> 13:48.520\n I don't know how tolerant the world will be,\n\n13:48.520 --> 13:53.520\n but I'm very prepared to change anything I believe in\n\n13:53.920 --> 13:55.400\n if I think deeply enough about it\n\n13:55.400 --> 13:59.640\n or a good enough argument is made so that I might reconsider.\n\n13:59.640 --> 14:02.200\n Well, there certainly is currently an intolerance\n\n14:02.200 --> 14:04.880\n and that's one of the problems of our age.\n\n14:04.880 --> 14:06.960\n There's an intolerance towards change.\n\n14:06.960 --> 14:08.960\n And I'll also ask you about labels.\n\n14:08.960 --> 14:11.040\n You talked about sort of we like to bin each other\n\n14:11.040 --> 14:14.120\n into different categories, the blue or red\n\n14:14.120 --> 14:16.980\n or whatever the different categorization is.\n\n14:16.980 --> 14:20.720\n But it seems like the task before you\n\n14:20.720 --> 14:23.200\n as a young person defining our future\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:28.200\n is to make a tolerance of change the norm.\n\n14:28.720 --> 14:30.320\n Doing this podcast, for example,\n\n14:30.320 --> 14:33.040\n and then changing your mind one or two years later\n\n14:33.040 --> 14:36.520\n and doing so publicly without a big dramatic thing\n\n14:36.520 --> 14:38.960\n or maybe changing it on a daily basis\n\n14:39.920 --> 14:42.440\n and just being open about it and being transparent\n\n14:42.440 --> 14:43.720\n about your thought process.\n\n14:43.720 --> 14:48.720\n Maybe that is the beacon of hope for the philosophical way,\n\n14:49.760 --> 14:51.700\n the path of the philosopher.\n\n14:52.540 --> 14:55.320\n So that's your task in a sense\n\n14:55.320 --> 14:58.720\n is to change your mind openly and bravely.\n\n14:58.720 --> 14:59.560\n You know, you're right.\n\n14:59.560 --> 15:03.360\n And maybe I will just have to endure some sort of criticism\n\n15:03.360 --> 15:05.400\n for doing that, but I think that's very important.\n\n15:05.400 --> 15:08.840\n I think this ties back to this previous facet\n\n15:08.840 --> 15:11.600\n of our conversation where we were discussing\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:15.920\n if thinkers would win over systems\n\n15:15.920 --> 15:19.680\n that are devoted to preventing radical thought\n\n15:19.680 --> 15:24.680\n or if who will win the systems or the thinkers.\n\n15:25.920 --> 15:29.120\n I think it's crucial that my generation\n\n15:31.320 --> 15:34.200\n take up a hand in this fight.\n\n15:34.200 --> 15:37.280\n And I think it's important that I'm a part of that\n\n15:37.280 --> 15:40.360\n because I know that I have some opportunity\n\n15:40.360 --> 15:45.360\n to, there is, I think it is my obligation\n\n15:47.480 --> 15:50.960\n as a member of a generation whose only real hope\n\n15:50.960 --> 15:53.280\n is to think outside of a system\n\n15:53.280 --> 15:57.080\n because whatever systems exist are collapsing.\n\n15:57.080 --> 15:59.440\n I think it is really my obligation\n\n15:59.440 --> 16:02.760\n to try to play some role, whatever role I can\n\n16:02.760 --> 16:06.540\n and being an instrument in that change.\n\n16:06.540 --> 16:11.040\n Are you, as a young mind, do you have a sense of fear\n\n16:11.040 --> 16:13.640\n about just like how afraid were you\n\n16:13.640 --> 16:15.520\n to do this podcast conversation?\n\n16:15.520 --> 16:18.520\n Do you have a sense of fear of thinking publicly?\n\n16:19.360 --> 16:23.240\n Yeah, I don't even think that that fear is irrational.\n\n16:23.240 --> 16:28.240\n It's very difficult to exist publicly in any form now\n\n16:28.960 --> 16:33.360\n because it's very easy for anyone to take cheap shots\n\n16:33.360 --> 16:38.240\n at something which is difficult and as I said,\n\n16:39.120 --> 16:43.320\n the people who are trying to have the difficult ideas\n\n16:43.320 --> 16:47.560\n and conversations are perhaps putting others\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:51.520\n in actual danger because everyone is so desperate\n\n16:51.520 --> 16:55.380\n that they might be willing to try anything.\n\n16:55.380 --> 16:59.120\n So there's a certain amount of responsibility\n\n16:59.120 --> 17:03.440\n which one has to take going before the public\n\n17:03.440 --> 17:07.820\n and there is a certain amount of ridicule\n\n17:07.820 --> 17:10.620\n which will be completely unwarranted\n\n17:10.620 --> 17:14.280\n that anyone must endure for it.\n\n17:15.840 --> 17:20.120\n And I think that means that one has to be afraid\n\n17:20.120 --> 17:22.040\n because they could both ruin the world\n\n17:22.040 --> 17:23.760\n and be ruined by the world\n\n17:23.760 --> 17:28.760\n in an unwarranted and undeserved fashion.\n\n17:31.480 --> 17:34.000\n I would like to believe in myself enough\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.960\n to try to accept this as a task\n\n17:35.960 --> 17:39.760\n because I think people need to try\n\n17:39.760 --> 17:41.000\n or there's no getting out of this\n\n17:41.000 --> 17:44.740\n and we will end in some kind of crazy, brilliant war.\n\n17:44.740 --> 17:45.580\n Awfully put.\n\n17:45.580 --> 17:48.480\n You've said also that in these times we can't have labels\n\n17:48.480 --> 17:51.400\n because it holds us back.\n\n17:51.400 --> 17:53.540\n Maybe we've already talked about it a little bit\n\n17:53.540 --> 17:56.540\n but this idea of labels is really interesting.\n\n17:56.540 --> 17:59.560\n Why do you think labels hold us back?\n\n17:59.560 --> 18:04.120\n Well, I think many underestimate the extent\n\n18:04.120 --> 18:09.120\n to which language and communication really impacts\n\n18:09.420 --> 18:12.600\n and shapes the ideas and thoughts\n\n18:12.600 --> 18:14.740\n which are being communicated.\n\n18:14.740 --> 18:19.740\n And I think if we're willing to accept imperfect labels\n\n18:19.740 --> 18:23.000\n to categorize particular people or thoughts,\n\n18:23.000 --> 18:27.200\n in some sense, we are corrupting an abstraction\n\n18:27.200 --> 18:30.160\n in order to represent it and communicate about it.\n\n18:30.160 --> 18:33.120\n And I think as we've discussed,\n\n18:33.120 --> 18:36.320\n those abstractions are particularly important\n\n18:36.320 --> 18:37.880\n when everything is on fire.\n\n18:41.880 --> 18:46.880\n We should not be sacrificing grand thoughts\n\n18:46.880 --> 18:49.720\n for the ability to express it.\n\n18:49.720 --> 18:53.560\n I think everyone should work much harder,\n\n18:53.560 --> 18:56.280\n including myself, to really be thinking abstractly\n\n18:56.280 --> 19:00.000\n in abstract terms instead of using concrete terms\n\n19:00.000 --> 19:04.680\n to discuss abstraction while ruining it slightly.\n\n19:04.680 --> 19:07.520\n Yeah, it's kind of a skill actually.\n\n19:07.520 --> 19:12.520\n So one really difficult example in the recent time\n\n19:12.520 --> 19:17.520\n that maybe you can comment on if you have been thinking\n\n19:21.200 --> 19:23.460\n about it is just politics.\n\n19:23.460 --> 19:25.600\n And there's a lot of labels in politics\n\n19:25.600 --> 19:29.080\n that it takes a lot of skill to be able\n\n19:29.080 --> 19:31.400\n to communicate difficult ideas\n\n19:31.400 --> 19:34.040\n without labels being attached to you.\n\n19:34.040 --> 19:37.280\n That's something that I've been sort of thinking about a lot\n\n19:37.280 --> 19:40.120\n in trying to express, for example,\n\n19:40.120 --> 19:44.160\n how much I love various aspects of the foundational ideas\n\n19:44.160 --> 19:46.360\n of this country, like freedom,\n\n19:46.360 --> 19:50.640\n and just saying, I love America, a simple statement.\n\n19:50.640 --> 19:53.260\n I love the ideas that we're finding to America.\n\n19:53.260 --> 19:55.360\n Well, often in the current time,\n\n19:55.360 --> 19:57.760\n well, people will try, they desperately try\n\n19:57.760 --> 20:00.320\n to attach a label to me, for example,\n\n20:00.320 --> 20:03.960\n for saying I love America, that I'm a Republican,\n\n20:03.960 --> 20:07.080\n a Donald Trump supporter, and it takes elegance\n\n20:07.080 --> 20:12.080\n and grace and skill to avoid those labels\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:13.780\n so that people can actually listen\n\n20:13.780 --> 20:15.680\n to the contents of your words\n\n20:15.680 --> 20:20.040\n versus the summarization that results\n\n20:20.040 --> 20:24.400\n from just the labels that they can pin on you.\n\n20:24.400 --> 20:27.120\n Are you cognizant of the skill required there\n\n20:27.120 --> 20:28.440\n of being able to communicate\n\n20:28.440 --> 20:31.520\n without being branded a Republican or a Democrat\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:34.000\n in this particular set of conversations?\n\n20:34.000 --> 20:35.960\n I'm sure there's other dangerous labels\n\n20:35.960 --> 20:37.160\n that could be attached.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:42.300\n I don't think there's any way of avoiding that right now.\n\n20:42.300 --> 20:47.300\n It might not be anyone's best effort to really try.\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:52.140\n I think the thing I can say, which will most speak to that,\n\n20:52.140 --> 20:57.140\n which I truly believe, is that participating\n\n20:57.400 --> 21:01.040\n in modern conventional politics\n\n21:01.040 --> 21:04.560\n is not being inherently political\n\n21:04.560 --> 21:06.480\n in a generative sense.\n\n21:06.480 --> 21:11.480\n It's this repeated trope where politics now\n\n21:11.960 --> 21:14.920\n is not about creating new political ideologies.\n\n21:14.920 --> 21:17.720\n It's about defending ideologies which already exist\n\n21:17.720 --> 21:20.580\n so that everyone can keep what they have.\n\n21:20.580 --> 21:23.280\n And that's where all of the name calling\n\n21:23.280 --> 21:26.520\n and the labeling really comes in.\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:31.520\n It's an attempt to constrict whatever may be generated\n\n21:31.520 --> 21:36.520\n to standard conversations and discussions\n\n21:37.580 --> 21:42.460\n so that arguments can be straw manned and defeated\n\n21:42.460 --> 21:43.940\n and people can keep what they have\n\n21:43.940 --> 21:47.020\n because everyone's very, very scared.\n\n21:48.880 --> 21:51.660\n I want to be very political,\n\n21:51.660 --> 21:54.680\n but not in a standard political sense\n\n21:54.680 --> 21:57.540\n where I'm defending a particular party\n\n21:57.540 --> 22:00.300\n or place on a spectrum.\n\n22:00.300 --> 22:04.740\n I would like to play some role in inventing new spectrums\n\n22:04.740 --> 22:07.260\n and I think that's most important politically\n\n22:07.260 --> 22:12.260\n because above most else, politics is about real power\n\n22:13.740 --> 22:17.060\n and conventional politicians have real power\n\n22:17.980 --> 22:21.320\n and that power will find terrible outlets\n\n22:21.320 --> 22:25.220\n if new spectrums for that power to live are not invented.\n\n22:26.540 --> 22:28.020\n So you're not afraid of politics.\n\n22:28.020 --> 22:30.940\n You're afraid of political discourse at the deepest,\n\n22:30.940 --> 22:35.060\n richest level of what political discourse is supposed to mean.\n\n22:35.060 --> 22:39.100\n Actually, I'm very afraid of it, but once again, we have no.\n\n22:39.100 --> 22:41.020\n That's not paralyzing for you.\n\n22:41.020 --> 22:42.300\n You feel like it's a responsibility,\n\n22:42.300 --> 22:43.600\n you're ready to take it on.\n\n22:43.600 --> 22:44.800\n Yes.\n\n22:44.800 --> 22:46.340\n This is a good sign.\n\n22:46.340 --> 22:48.540\n This is, you're a special human.\n\n22:48.540 --> 22:51.680\n Okay, let's talk maybe fun, maybe profound.\n\n22:52.860 --> 22:55.380\n We talked about philosophers, philosophy.\n\n22:55.380 --> 22:57.500\n Who's your favorite philosopher?\n\n22:57.500 --> 23:01.740\n Like somebody in your current time but neither influential\n\n23:01.740 --> 23:06.380\n or you just enjoy his, her ideas\n\n23:06.380 --> 23:08.900\n or writing or anything like that?\n\n23:08.900 --> 23:11.540\n Weirdly, I'll give an answer\n\n23:11.540 --> 23:14.720\n which sort of doesn't have much to do\n\n23:14.720 --> 23:18.580\n with whom I might imagine myself to be.\n\n23:18.580 --> 23:21.660\n I like Thomas Aquinas at the moment.\n\n23:21.660 --> 23:24.260\n I think he's very inspirational to me\n\n23:24.260 --> 23:26.260\n given what we're going through\n\n23:26.260 --> 23:30.700\n and that's not because his particular ideas\n\n23:30.700 --> 23:35.700\n of religion or God or unmoved movers\n\n23:35.780 --> 23:40.780\n are particularly inspirational to me\n\n23:40.980 --> 23:44.100\n and I don't even think they were necessarily right.\n\n23:45.340 --> 23:50.340\n But he was introducing aspects of the scientific method\n\n23:52.100 --> 23:55.460\n during one of the darkest periods in human history\n\n23:55.460 --> 23:57.940\n when we had lost all hope and reason\n\n23:57.940 --> 24:01.260\n and ability to think logically.\n\n24:01.260 --> 24:06.100\n So I think he was really something of a light in the dark\n\n24:06.100 --> 24:09.420\n and I think we need to look to people like that\n\n24:09.420 --> 24:10.540\n at the moment.\n\n24:10.540 --> 24:15.540\n The other reason why I think I need to learn from him\n\n24:15.860 --> 24:18.660\n is that even though he was doing something\n\n24:18.660 --> 24:20.660\n which really needed to be done\n\n24:20.660 --> 24:25.660\n and introducing scientific thought and reason\n\n24:25.700 --> 24:29.040\n to a time that lacked it,\n\n24:30.420 --> 24:35.020\n he was not saying anything that would have been offensive\n\n24:35.020 --> 24:39.140\n to whatever powers were in play during his time.\n\n24:39.140 --> 24:43.560\n He was writing about the importance of faith in God\n\n24:43.560 --> 24:45.580\n and how we could prove it.\n\n24:45.580 --> 24:49.980\n And so it's important to remember, I suppose,\n\n24:49.980 --> 24:54.980\n that having ideas that shape the world\n\n24:55.500 --> 24:58.780\n and which bring the world closer to what we can prove\n\n24:58.780 --> 25:01.140\n it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to work\n\n25:01.140 --> 25:04.140\n does not always take some sort of grand contradiction\n\n25:04.140 --> 25:05.520\n of whatever's in play.\n\n25:06.700 --> 25:09.660\n And the most courageous thing to do\n\n25:09.660 --> 25:13.400\n may not always be the most helpful thing to do.\n\n25:13.400 --> 25:18.400\n And I think it's very easy for anyone with ideas\n\n25:18.400 --> 25:23.200\n about how everything is broken to become very cynical\n\n25:23.200 --> 25:25.920\n and say, oh, the system, man, they're all wrong.\n\n25:27.840 --> 25:32.600\n I think it takes another kind of discipline\n\n25:32.600 --> 25:35.320\n to be a person with real ideas\n\n25:35.320 --> 25:38.400\n and to make the world better\n\n25:38.400 --> 25:41.960\n without stepping on anyone's toes or contradicting anyone.\n\n25:41.960 --> 25:43.160\n I have real respect for that.\n\n25:43.160 --> 25:44.520\n So being able to be,\n\n25:44.520 --> 25:46.360\n when it's within your principles to operate,\n\n25:46.360 --> 25:48.600\n within the current system of thought.\n\n25:48.600 --> 25:53.600\n Yeah, and not offend anyone, not say anything outlandish,\n\n25:54.360 --> 25:57.080\n but introduce the method\n\n25:57.080 --> 26:00.360\n by which progress must be achieved.\n\n26:00.360 --> 26:03.520\n I think that takes a kind of maturity,\n\n26:03.520 --> 26:07.480\n which is found very rarely now.\n\n26:07.480 --> 26:10.280\n And I really look to him for inspiration\n\n26:10.280 --> 26:13.120\n despite whatever disagreements I may have\n\n26:13.120 --> 26:16.120\n with the minute details of his philosophy.\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:20.360\n Yeah, it takes a lot of skill, a lot of character,\n\n26:20.360 --> 26:23.480\n and yeah, deep thinking to be able to operate\n\n26:23.480 --> 26:25.200\n within the system when needed\n\n26:25.200 --> 26:29.840\n and having the fortitude and just the boldness\n\n26:29.840 --> 26:33.320\n to step outside and to burn the system down when needed,\n\n26:33.320 --> 26:36.400\n but rarely, and opportune moments\n\n26:36.400 --> 26:38.080\n that would actually have impact.\n\n26:38.080 --> 26:40.520\n I mean, it's ultimately about impact\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:42.480\n within the society that you live in,\n\n26:42.480 --> 26:46.480\n not just making a statement that has no impact.\n\n26:46.480 --> 26:50.080\n Yeah, and we were talking about how dangerous it is\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:55.080\n to do real philosophy at dangerous broken times.\n\n26:55.840 --> 26:59.000\n He was going through the most broken time in history\n\n26:59.000 --> 27:04.000\n and he questioned the methods\n\n27:05.120 --> 27:10.120\n which made a broken system able to survive.\n\n27:10.120 --> 27:12.120\n And he was so skilled and so graceful\n\n27:12.120 --> 27:15.680\n that he became a saint in that tradition.\n\n27:15.680 --> 27:19.080\n And there's something for me to really learn from there.\n\n27:19.080 --> 27:20.400\n Do you draw any inspiration,\n\n27:20.400 --> 27:23.320\n have any interest in the sort of more modern philosophers,\n\n27:23.320 --> 27:25.320\n maybe the existentialists?\n\n27:25.320 --> 27:27.640\n I mean, Nietzsche is one of the early ones.\n\n27:27.640 --> 27:31.640\n Do you have thoughts on the guy in general\n\n27:31.640 --> 27:34.040\n or any of the other existentialists?\n\n27:34.040 --> 27:36.480\n Well, with regard to Nietzsche,\n\n27:36.480 --> 27:40.840\n I think Yates might've said that he's the worst.\n\n27:40.840 --> 27:44.040\n He was certainly filled with passionate intensity.\n\n27:46.320 --> 27:47.160\n I think...\n\n27:47.160 --> 27:48.000\n Was that a compliment?\n\n27:48.000 --> 27:52.240\n He was the worst or a criticism or both?\n\n27:52.240 --> 27:53.640\n Yates had this big line,\n\n27:53.640 --> 27:55.480\n that the best lack all conviction,\n\n27:55.480 --> 27:58.680\n the worst are filled with passionate intensity.\n\n27:59.760 --> 28:04.760\n So I think Nietzsche was destroyed\n\n28:04.760 --> 28:09.760\n by the horrors of everything that went on around him.\n\n28:10.800 --> 28:14.800\n And I think he never really recovered from it.\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:19.800\n I think that's because if you think about Nietzsche's\n\n28:20.880 --> 28:25.880\n philosophy, he was very opposed to any sort of acceptance\n\n28:25.880 --> 28:26.920\n of what one had.\n\n28:26.920 --> 28:29.200\n One should always envy those who have more\n\n28:29.200 --> 28:33.200\n and use that envy to fuel their ideas.\n\n28:33.200 --> 28:38.200\n To fuel their growth and accept whatever\n\n28:39.880 --> 28:42.960\n the human condition and desires are\n\n28:42.960 --> 28:46.680\n and use those desires to want more and more\n\n28:46.680 --> 28:49.920\n and make use of your greed.\n\n28:49.920 --> 28:54.920\n I think it's very difficult to be truly happy\n\n28:54.920 --> 29:03.920\n if the thing which you pride yourself most on\n\n29:03.920 --> 29:07.520\n is never being satisfied.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:09.280\n And I think Nietzsche was never satisfied\n\n29:09.280 --> 29:12.200\n and that was the danger of his philosophy.\n\n29:12.200 --> 29:15.360\n I think also with his amoralism,\n\n29:15.360 --> 29:18.000\n there is no good or evil.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:22.680\n I sort of disagree with that on a pretty fundamental basis.\n\n29:22.680 --> 29:27.680\n I think that our notion of morality\n\n29:27.760 --> 29:29.840\n is by no means subjective.\n\n29:29.840 --> 29:34.840\n It's really the proxy for the fitness of a society.\n\n29:35.000 --> 29:39.160\n I think whatever we consider ethical,\n\n29:39.160 --> 29:41.920\n like don't steal, don't murder, don't do this,\n\n29:44.360 --> 29:47.320\n societies have a very difficult time running.\n\n29:47.320 --> 29:48.880\n It's very hard to run a civilization\n\n29:48.880 --> 29:51.720\n when everyone is stealing from everyone else\n\n29:51.720 --> 29:54.080\n and people are murdering each other\n\n29:54.080 --> 29:56.680\n and committing these things,\n\n29:56.680 --> 30:00.480\n which we would consider atrocities.\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:03.680\n So I think we also, we know this\n\n30:03.680 --> 30:07.200\n because I think very similar notions of morality\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:12.200\n have evolved convergently from different traditions.\n\n30:12.800 --> 30:17.800\n I think good is a proxy for a civilization's fitness\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:22.800\n and the good news is that that means that evil\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:27.000\n in being anathema to that good\n\n30:27.000 --> 30:32.000\n must therefore be the opposite of stable\n\n30:33.040 --> 30:34.920\n in whatever way that it's evil.\n\n30:34.920 --> 30:37.680\n And that means that good will always be more stable\n\n30:37.680 --> 30:41.440\n than evil and the only way evil can really win\n\n30:41.440 --> 30:43.320\n is like if everyone dies.\n\n30:43.320 --> 30:46.240\n So I think that's a good thing.\n\n30:46.240 --> 30:48.120\n Everyone dies, so.\n\n30:49.400 --> 30:51.360\n So wait, can you say that again?\n\n30:51.360 --> 30:54.240\n Good is a proxy for society's what?\n\n30:54.240 --> 30:56.600\n Good is a proxy for the stability\n\n30:56.600 --> 30:59.760\n and fitness of a civilization and evil.\n\n30:59.760 --> 31:01.000\n Damn, that's a good definition.\n\n31:01.000 --> 31:01.840\n Thank you.\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:02.920\n So you're throwing some bombs today.\n\n31:02.920 --> 31:03.760\n Okay, all right.\n\n31:06.720 --> 31:08.880\n Okay, this is exciting.\n\n31:08.880 --> 31:11.240\n Sorry, sorry to interrupt your flow there,\n\n31:11.240 --> 31:12.880\n but it's just a damn good line.\n\n31:12.880 --> 31:13.720\n Thank you.\n\n31:13.720 --> 31:14.560\n Yeah.\n\n31:15.440 --> 31:18.280\n So in that sense, that's a kind of optimistic view\n\n31:18.280 --> 31:21.480\n that if by definition good is a proxy for stability,\n\n31:21.480 --> 31:22.920\n then it's going to be stable\n\n31:22.920 --> 31:25.880\n unless the entire world just blows itself up.\n\n31:25.880 --> 31:28.360\n So good wins in the end by definition.\n\n31:28.360 --> 31:29.480\n Yeah.\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:34.480\n Or no, well, good wins unless it all goes\n\n31:35.600 --> 31:39.080\n to complete destruction.\n\n31:39.080 --> 31:40.320\n That's beautifully put.\n\n31:40.320 --> 31:41.160\n Thank you.\n\n31:41.160 --> 31:46.160\n On a topic of sort of good and evil being human illusions,\n\n31:49.120 --> 31:53.920\n you've said that more broadly than that about truth,\n\n31:53.920 --> 31:56.880\n that it is easier in some ways to be unified under truth\n\n31:56.880 --> 31:59.800\n because it is universal than it is to be unified\n\n31:59.800 --> 32:02.960\n under belief, which at times can be completely subjective.\n\n32:02.960 --> 32:06.560\n So what is the nature of truth to you?\n\n32:06.560 --> 32:09.800\n Can we understand the world objectively\n\n32:09.800 --> 32:12.920\n or is most of what we can understand about the world\n\n32:12.920 --> 32:16.880\n is just a subjective opinions\n\n32:16.880 --> 32:20.280\n that we kind of all agree on in these little collectives\n\n32:20.280 --> 32:25.080\n and over time it kind of evolves completely detached\n\n32:25.080 --> 32:26.560\n from objective reality.\n\n32:26.560 --> 32:31.080\n I think this is the greatest argument for objectivity\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:35.480\n is that something that is objectively true\n\n32:35.480 --> 32:40.200\n cannot be true to me and untrue to you.\n\n32:40.200 --> 32:42.400\n You can feel that it's untrue,\n\n32:42.400 --> 32:45.520\n but that would be unproductive\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:50.520\n and create unnecessary tension and conflict.\n\n32:50.520 --> 32:55.520\n I think this is one reason for the importance of science\n\n32:55.880 --> 32:58.760\n as a tool for stability.\n\n32:58.760 --> 33:07.760\n If science is the search for truth and truth can never really be,\n\n33:07.760 --> 33:08.760\n I shouldn't say that,\n\n33:08.760 --> 33:12.840\n truth should never be an engine of conflict\n\n33:12.840 --> 33:15.800\n because no two people should disagree on something\n\n33:15.800 --> 33:18.480\n which is objectively true,\n\n33:18.480 --> 33:22.520\n then in some sense, search for truth is searching\n\n33:22.520 --> 33:27.240\n for a common ground where we can all exist\n\n33:27.240 --> 33:32.240\n and live without contradicting or attacking each other.\n\n33:32.400 --> 33:34.680\n Do you have a hope that there is a lot of common ground\n\n33:34.680 --> 33:36.360\n to be discovered?\n\n33:36.360 --> 33:39.280\n Sure, I mean, if we continue scientifically,\n\n33:41.080 --> 33:42.720\n we are discovering truth\n\n33:42.720 --> 33:45.120\n and in that discovering common ground\n\n33:45.120 --> 33:46.600\n on which we can all agree.\n\n33:46.600 --> 33:51.240\n That's one reason why I think caring about science,\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:54.600\n if you have a culture which cares very deeply about science,\n\n33:54.600 --> 33:59.160\n that's a culture which is not necessarily bound\n\n33:59.160 --> 34:04.120\n to injure unwarranted internal conflict.\n\n34:04.120 --> 34:06.000\n I think that's one reason that I'm so passionate\n\n34:06.000 --> 34:09.400\n about science is it's search for universal ground.\n\n34:09.400 --> 34:11.600\n Let me just throw out an example\n\n34:11.600 --> 34:14.400\n of a modern day philosophical thinker.\n\n34:14.400 --> 34:17.240\n We'll keep your dad, Eric Weinstein out of the picture\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:21.080\n for a sec, but he does happen to be an example of one,\n\n34:21.080 --> 34:23.600\n but Jordan Peterson is an example of another,\n\n34:23.600 --> 34:25.800\n somebody who thinks deeply about this world.\n\n34:26.760 --> 34:30.400\n His ideas are by a certain percent of the population,\n\n34:30.400 --> 34:33.640\n sort of speaking of truth, are labeled as dangerous.\n\n34:34.800 --> 34:36.720\n Why do you think his ideas\n\n34:36.720 --> 34:40.760\n or just ideas of these kinds of deep thinkers in general\n\n34:40.760 --> 34:43.920\n are labeled as dangerous in our modern world?\n\n34:43.920 --> 34:46.320\n Is it similar to what you've been discussing\n\n34:46.320 --> 34:50.720\n that in difficult times, philosophers become dangerous?\n\n34:50.720 --> 34:52.320\n Or is there something specific\n\n34:52.320 --> 34:54.920\n about these particular thinkers in our time?\n\n34:54.920 --> 34:58.880\n Well, I think Jordan Peterson is very anti establishment\n\n34:58.880 --> 35:01.320\n in a lot of his beliefs.\n\n35:01.320 --> 35:03.760\n He's an unconventional thinker.\n\n35:03.760 --> 35:08.760\n And I think we need, regardless of whatever\n\n35:10.200 --> 35:13.240\n Jordan's particular views and beliefs are,\n\n35:13.240 --> 35:18.240\n and if they bring about more danger than truth,\n\n35:18.240 --> 35:21.720\n or if they don't, it's very important\n\n35:21.720 --> 35:24.560\n to have fundamental thinkers\n\n35:24.560 --> 35:28.760\n who exist outside of a conventional framework.\n\n35:28.760 --> 35:33.280\n So do I think that he's dangerous?\n\n35:33.280 --> 35:38.280\n I think by existing outside of a system which is known,\n\n35:40.600 --> 35:41.680\n he is dangerous.\n\n35:41.680 --> 35:45.880\n And I think we have to, in some sense,\n\n35:45.880 --> 35:50.280\n in some sense, we have to welcome danger in that capacity\n\n35:50.280 --> 35:53.840\n because it will be our only way out of this.\n\n35:53.840 --> 35:58.840\n So regardless of whether his beliefs are right or wrong,\n\n36:03.480 --> 36:06.200\n I'm pretty adamant about the fact\n\n36:06.200 --> 36:11.200\n that we need to support thought which may rescue us.\n\n36:11.200 --> 36:16.200\n And that thought can appear radical or dangerous at times.\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:19.280\n But ultimately, if you allow for it,\n\n36:20.160 --> 36:22.280\n this is kind of the difficult discussion of free speech\n\n36:22.280 --> 36:27.280\n and so on, is ultimately difficult ideas\n\n36:27.920 --> 36:30.720\n will pave the way for progress.\n\n36:30.720 --> 36:34.280\n Yeah, and I'd actually, I'd like to slow you down there\n\n36:34.280 --> 36:37.800\n because I think like one of the issues\n\n36:37.800 --> 36:40.840\n we were discussing previously was the fact\n\n36:40.840 --> 36:45.840\n that language often destroys our ability to think.\n\n36:48.240 --> 36:52.120\n When we're talking about whether his ideas are radical,\n\n36:52.120 --> 36:55.960\n I don't know if we mean radical in the traditional sense\n\n36:55.960 --> 37:00.120\n of having to do with the root of a problem\n\n37:00.120 --> 37:05.120\n or in the more modern sense of being very extreme.\n\n37:05.560 --> 37:09.800\n And I think that's completely by design,\n\n37:09.800 --> 37:13.360\n I think fundamental thought,\n\n37:13.360 --> 37:18.360\n which semantically would once be considered radical thought\n\n37:18.880 --> 37:20.640\n became very dangerous.\n\n37:20.640 --> 37:23.120\n And now it's become synonymous with extreme\n\n37:23.120 --> 37:26.120\n or dangerous thought, which means that anyone\n\n37:26.120 --> 37:29.000\n who considers themselves a radical thinker\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:34.000\n is semantically also a dangerous or extreme thinker.\n\n37:36.480 --> 37:38.680\n These are not helpful labels in a sense\n\n37:38.680 --> 37:42.960\n that the moment you say radical or extremist thinker,\n\n37:42.960 --> 37:46.720\n then you're just, well, how do I put it?\n\n37:46.720 --> 37:51.720\n You're not helping the public discourse, exchange of ideas.\n\n37:52.720 --> 37:54.840\n But through no fault of our own,\n\n37:54.840 --> 37:58.160\n the concept of radical as having to do with a root\n\n37:58.160 --> 38:03.160\n is it's an obvious concept for which there must be language\n\n38:03.160 --> 38:06.920\n and a lot of the attack on thought has to do\n\n38:06.920 --> 38:11.920\n with attacking language, which communicates conceptually.\n\n38:12.840 --> 38:16.120\n So like this is an example of how our world\n\n38:16.120 --> 38:18.960\n is becoming increasingly Orwellian.\n\n38:18.960 --> 38:21.360\n It's just language is being used to destroy\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:23.600\n our ability to think.\n\n38:23.600 --> 38:26.000\n I think I can't remember exactly what the numbers are,\n\n38:26.000 --> 38:28.800\n but I read some statistic about how greatly\n\n38:28.800 --> 38:32.400\n the average English vocabulary has been used\n\n38:32.400 --> 38:36.440\n and the vocabulary has decreased since 1960.\n\n38:36.440 --> 38:38.400\n It was like some incredible number.\n\n38:38.400 --> 38:39.880\n It really baffled me.\n\n38:39.880 --> 38:44.360\n It's like, how are people less able to think in a time\n\n38:44.360 --> 38:46.480\n when the world is supposed to be growing\n\n38:46.480 --> 38:50.400\n at a never before seen rate?\n\n38:50.400 --> 38:54.400\n It's like, we can't keep on, we can't sustain this growth\n\n38:54.400 --> 38:58.440\n if we destroy everyone's ability to think\n\n38:58.440 --> 39:00.960\n because the growth requires thinking\n\n39:00.960 --> 39:05.520\n and we're ruining the tools for it.\n\n39:05.520 --> 39:09.440\n I watched your podcast with Noam Chomsky\n\n39:09.440 --> 39:14.000\n and I think one interesting thing which he discussed\n\n39:14.000 --> 39:18.440\n was how language is more used to develop thoughts\n\n39:18.440 --> 39:21.600\n within our own head than it is used to communicate\n\n39:21.600 --> 39:24.040\n those thoughts with others.\n\n39:24.040 --> 39:28.080\n If the language doesn't change, even if its usage changes,\n\n39:28.080 --> 39:32.320\n when language is destroyed in communication,\n\n39:32.320 --> 39:37.320\n it also stymies our ability to think reasonably\n\n39:38.640 --> 39:40.680\n and I'm very, very worried.\n\n39:41.600 --> 39:46.600\n But the language in communication requires a medium\n\n39:46.960 --> 39:48.280\n and there's a lot of different mediums.\n\n39:48.280 --> 39:51.440\n So there's social media, there's Twitter,\n\n39:51.440 --> 39:54.880\n there's writing books, there's blog posts,\n\n39:54.880 --> 39:59.880\n there's podcasts, there's YouTube videos,\n\n40:00.800 --> 40:04.800\n all of things you have dipped a toe in\n\n40:04.800 --> 40:08.320\n in your exploration of different mediums of communication.\n\n40:08.320 --> 40:12.680\n Which do you see yourself, this might be just a poetic way\n\n40:12.680 --> 40:14.200\n of asking are you gonna do a podcast,\n\n40:14.200 --> 40:19.120\n but broader picture, what do you think as an intellectual\n\n40:19.120 --> 40:22.880\n in this world for you personally\n\n40:22.880 --> 40:26.600\n would be the path for communicating your ideas to the world?\n\n40:26.600 --> 40:30.040\n What are the mediums you are currently drawn to\n\n40:30.040 --> 40:33.400\n out of the ones I mentioned or maybe something I didn't?\n\n40:33.400 --> 40:38.400\n To answer your question concretely before abstractly,\n\n40:39.600 --> 40:42.720\n I'm scared but I need to do a podcast.\n\n40:42.720 --> 40:45.880\n It's important, it is my obligation\n\n40:45.880 --> 40:47.720\n as a member of my generation.\n\n40:47.720 --> 40:51.160\n I really hope that more people my age start to do this\n\n40:51.160 --> 40:56.160\n because we will be the people in charge of new ideas\n\n40:56.160 --> 40:59.120\n which either sink or swim.\n\n40:59.120 --> 41:01.320\n How upset will your dad be\n\n41:01.320 --> 41:04.680\n when your podcast quickly becomes more popular than his?\n\n41:04.680 --> 41:07.240\n I think he would be negatively upset.\n\n41:07.240 --> 41:09.640\n I'll say he'd be proud, he's a good dad.\n\n41:09.640 --> 41:11.960\n I really think so, yeah.\n\n41:11.960 --> 41:13.680\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n41:13.680 --> 41:17.000\n Yeah, so but then zooming out, do you think podcasts,\n\n41:17.000 --> 41:20.000\n are you excited by the possibility\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:24.080\n of other mediums outside of podcasting to communicate ideas?\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:27.360\n I would be if people still read books\n\n41:27.360 --> 41:28.840\n or did things like that.\n\n41:30.800 --> 41:33.440\n I'm somewhat guilty of this.\n\n41:33.440 --> 41:36.440\n A lot of the books I read are very technical\n\n41:38.960 --> 41:43.960\n and then my, to absorb like really deep modern conversations\n\n41:43.960 --> 41:48.960\n I listen to podcasts and I don't really read many books\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:55.440\n on like the matters that we're discussing, for example.\n\n41:55.440 --> 41:57.480\n It's fascinating because you're making me think\n\n41:57.480 --> 42:00.800\n of something that I align with you very much\n\n42:00.800 --> 42:03.480\n of how I consume deep thinkers currently.\n\n42:03.480 --> 42:05.480\n So what happens is somebody who thinks deeply\n\n42:05.480 --> 42:10.280\n about the world will write a book, Jordan Peterson example,\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:12.020\n and instead of reading their book,\n\n42:12.020 --> 42:14.360\n I'll just listen to podcast conversations\n\n42:14.360 --> 42:17.780\n of them talking about the book, which I find to,\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:22.240\n this is really sad, but I find that to be\n\n42:22.240 --> 42:25.720\n a more compelling way to think about their ideas\n\n42:25.720 --> 42:28.800\n because they're often challenged in certain ways\n\n42:28.800 --> 42:31.840\n in those conversations and they're forced to,\n\n42:31.840 --> 42:34.200\n after having boiled them down and really thought\n\n42:34.200 --> 42:36.240\n through them enough to write a book.\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:38.480\n So it's almost like they needed to go through the process\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:41.280\n of writing a book just so they could think through,\n\n42:41.280 --> 42:43.080\n convert the language in their minds\n\n42:43.080 --> 42:44.480\n into something more concrete,\n\n42:44.480 --> 42:47.600\n and then the actual exchange of ideas,\n\n42:47.600 --> 42:49.960\n the actual communication of ideas with the public happens\n\n42:49.960 --> 42:52.960\n not with the book, but after the book,\n\n42:52.960 --> 42:55.240\n with that person going on a book tour\n\n42:56.360 --> 42:58.120\n and communicating the ideas.\n\n42:58.120 --> 43:00.880\n Well, there are two meanings I make\n\n43:00.880 --> 43:03.880\n of why not too many people spend much\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:05.920\n of their time reading anymore.\n\n43:05.920 --> 43:10.400\n One interpretation is that we've lost our attention spans\n\n43:10.400 --> 43:13.600\n to our phones, people can't concentrate on a page\n\n43:13.600 --> 43:15.360\n if it takes them a minute to read,\n\n43:15.360 --> 43:18.960\n we're too busy watching TikToks or whatever people do.\n\n43:20.000 --> 43:24.320\n The other interpretation would be that language\n\n43:24.320 --> 43:28.200\n and verbal communication has,\n\n43:28.200 --> 43:31.020\n as well as some amount of communication,\n\n43:31.020 --> 43:33.880\n which is done through facial expression,\n\n43:33.880 --> 43:35.440\n tone of voice, et cetera.\n\n43:35.440 --> 43:38.000\n These are means of communication\n\n43:38.000 --> 43:42.160\n that have evolved along with humanity\n\n43:42.160 --> 43:44.560\n over thousands and thousands of years.\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:49.560\n So we know that we are built to communicate in this way.\n\n43:51.920 --> 43:56.920\n We have had writing for much less time.\n\n43:57.940 --> 43:59.900\n It is a system that we invented,\n\n43:59.900 --> 44:04.640\n not a system which evolved and is innately part\n\n44:04.640 --> 44:09.640\n of humanity or the human mind.\n\n44:11.520 --> 44:16.520\n And so we are designed to consume conversation\n\n44:16.680 --> 44:18.560\n by our own evolution.\n\n44:18.560 --> 44:22.880\n We are designed to consume writing\n\n44:24.180 --> 44:26.000\n by some process of symbols\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:28.360\n that's evolved over a couple of thousand years.\n\n44:28.360 --> 44:33.360\n It makes sense to me why many are much more compelled\n\n44:35.840 --> 44:38.600\n to listen to podcasts, for example,\n\n44:38.600 --> 44:41.280\n than they are to read books.\n\n44:41.280 --> 44:46.280\n It could be that this is simply a technological progression\n\n44:47.640 --> 44:52.640\n which has displaced reading conventionally\n\n44:52.640 --> 44:57.480\n instead of some sort of maladaptation of our minds,\n\n44:57.480 --> 45:01.320\n which has corrupted our attention spans.\n\n45:01.320 --> 45:03.480\n Likely there's some combination\n\n45:03.480 --> 45:07.440\n which determines why people spend much less time reading.\n\n45:07.440 --> 45:10.680\n But I don't think it's necessarily because we're all broken.\n\n45:10.680 --> 45:12.640\n It may simply have to do with the fact\n\n45:12.640 --> 45:16.640\n that we are designed to listen through our ears\n\n45:16.640 --> 45:17.720\n and speak through our mouths.\n\n45:17.720 --> 45:22.720\n And we are not innately designed to communicate over a page.\n\n45:25.040 --> 45:26.760\n Yeah, there's an exciting coupling to me\n\n45:26.760 --> 45:30.600\n between like few second TikTok videos\n\n45:30.600 --> 45:32.280\n that are fun and addicting,\n\n45:32.280 --> 45:34.840\n and then the three, four hour podcasts,\n\n45:34.840 --> 45:39.040\n which are both really popular in our current time.\n\n45:39.040 --> 45:42.600\n So people are both hungry for the visual stimulation\n\n45:42.600 --> 45:45.520\n of internet humor and memes.\n\n45:45.520 --> 45:50.520\n I'm a huge fan of, and also slow moving deep conversations.\n\n45:53.080 --> 45:56.320\n And that might, you know, there's a lot of,\n\n45:56.320 --> 45:57.840\n I mean, it's part of your generation\n\n45:57.840 --> 45:59.880\n to define what that looks like moving forward.\n\n45:59.880 --> 46:02.240\n There were a lot of people, like Joe Rogan's\n\n46:02.240 --> 46:05.600\n one of the people that kind of started,\n\n46:05.600 --> 46:08.560\n accidentally stumbled into the discovery\n\n46:08.560 --> 46:10.280\n that this is like a thing.\n\n46:10.280 --> 46:13.880\n And now people are kind of scrambling to figure out\n\n46:13.880 --> 46:15.400\n why is this a thing?\n\n46:15.400 --> 46:16.800\n Like, why is there so much hunger\n\n46:16.800 --> 46:18.720\n for long form conversations?\n\n46:18.720 --> 46:21.100\n And how do we optimize that medium\n\n46:21.100 --> 46:23.480\n for further, further expression of deep ideas\n\n46:23.480 --> 46:24.640\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n46:24.640 --> 46:27.480\n And YouTube is a really interesting medium\n\n46:27.480 --> 46:28.880\n for that as well.\n\n46:28.880 --> 46:31.800\n Like video, sharing of videos,\n\n46:31.800 --> 46:35.240\n mostly YouTube is used with a spirit of like\n\n46:35.240 --> 46:37.440\n the TikTok spirit, if I can put it in that way,\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:41.100\n which is like, how do I have quick moving things\n\n46:41.100 --> 46:43.120\n that even if you're expressing difficult ideas,\n\n46:43.120 --> 46:46.360\n they should be quick and exciting and visual and switching.\n\n46:46.360 --> 46:48.200\n But there's a lot of exploration there\n\n46:48.200 --> 46:50.720\n to see what can we do something deeper\n\n46:50.720 --> 46:52.480\n and nobody knows.\n\n46:52.480 --> 46:56.700\n And you're part of the, you have a YouTube channel\n\n46:56.700 --> 46:58.980\n releasing one video every few years.\n\n47:00.240 --> 47:03.520\n So, so your momentum is currently quite slow,\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:05.160\n but perhaps it'll accelerate.\n\n47:05.160 --> 47:08.880\n You're one of the people that gets to define that medium.\n\n47:08.880 --> 47:12.680\n Is that, do you enjoy that, the visual YouTube medium\n\n47:12.680 --> 47:14.440\n of communication as well?\n\n47:14.440 --> 47:19.440\n I know that when the topic of conversation\n\n47:21.560 --> 47:26.560\n or the means by which a conversation is communicated\n\n47:26.860 --> 47:28.740\n or an idea is communicated,\n\n47:28.740 --> 47:32.240\n if that is sufficiently interesting to me,\n\n47:34.560 --> 47:35.780\n I will read a book on it.\n\n47:35.780 --> 47:37.380\n I would listen to a podcast on it.\n\n47:37.380 --> 47:40.720\n I would watch a video on it.\n\n47:40.720 --> 47:42.920\n I think if I'm very curious about something,\n\n47:43.880 --> 47:46.400\n I will consume it however possible.\n\n47:46.400 --> 47:48.640\n I think when I have to consume things\n\n47:48.640 --> 47:51.300\n which really don't interest me very much,\n\n47:52.620 --> 47:55.720\n I'm indeed much more ready to consume them\n\n47:55.720 --> 47:57.880\n through some sort of video or discussion\n\n47:57.880 --> 48:01.840\n than I am through like a long tedious book.\n\n48:01.840 --> 48:05.960\n So for the breadth of acquiring knowledge,\n\n48:05.960 --> 48:06.920\n video is good.\n\n48:06.920 --> 48:11.160\n For the depth, the medium doesn't matter.\n\n48:11.160 --> 48:12.920\n I think it'd be fun to ask you about\n\n48:12.920 --> 48:16.180\n some big philosophical questions\n\n48:16.180 --> 48:17.880\n to see if you have an opinion on them.\n\n48:17.880 --> 48:21.400\n Do you think there's a free will\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:24.080\n or is free will just an illusion?\n\n48:24.080 --> 48:28.600\n Well, I think classical mechanics would tell us\n\n48:28.600 --> 48:33.600\n that if we were to know every piece of information\n\n48:33.900 --> 48:36.180\n about a system and understand the rules\n\n48:36.180 --> 48:38.160\n which govern that system,\n\n48:38.160 --> 48:42.360\n we would be completely able to predict the future\n\n48:42.360 --> 48:44.240\n with complete accuracy.\n\n48:44.240 --> 48:49.240\n So if something could know everything about our lives,\n\n48:50.400 --> 48:53.360\n it could freeze time and understand the position\n\n48:53.360 --> 48:56.760\n of every neuron in my mind about to fire,\n\n48:58.280 --> 49:02.640\n no decision could be unpredictable.\n\n49:02.640 --> 49:07.640\n In some sense, there is that sort of fate.\n\n49:07.940 --> 49:11.980\n I think that doesn't make the decisions we make illegitimate\n\n49:11.980 --> 49:14.940\n even if some grand supercomputer could\n\n49:16.820 --> 49:19.940\n understand what decisions we would make beforehand\n\n49:19.940 --> 49:21.540\n with complete certainty.\n\n49:21.540 --> 49:24.300\n I think we're making legitimate systems\n\n49:24.300 --> 49:26.100\n within a system that has no freedom.\n\n49:27.420 --> 49:29.140\n We're making legitimate systems\n\n49:29.140 --> 49:30.740\n within a system that has no freedom.\n\n49:30.740 --> 49:33.580\n Can you explain what you mean by that?\n\n49:33.580 --> 49:38.580\n Yeah, so if we were to have just a simple pendulum\n\n49:40.120 --> 49:43.980\n and I told you how long the rope was,\n\n49:44.780 --> 49:47.820\n we froze it at a particular point\n\n49:47.820 --> 49:52.460\n and I told you how high above the ground the weight was\n\n49:52.460 --> 49:57.060\n and the motion of a pendulum is something\n\n49:57.060 --> 50:02.060\n which is easy for everyone to imagine, I could,\n\n50:03.140 --> 50:04.900\n if we had all of that information,\n\n50:04.900 --> 50:08.540\n you could ask me what will the pendulum do\n\n50:08.540 --> 50:10.100\n six and a half minutes from now?\n\n50:10.100 --> 50:12.860\n And we would have a precise answer.\n\n50:12.860 --> 50:16.100\n That's an example of a very simple system\n\n50:16.100 --> 50:17.960\n with a very simple Lagrangian.\n\n50:19.220 --> 50:23.180\n And we could completely predict the future.\n\n50:23.180 --> 50:26.740\n The pendulum has no ability to do anything\n\n50:26.740 --> 50:28.540\n that would surprise us.\n\n50:28.540 --> 50:33.540\n Weirdly, that's true of whatever this four dimensional,\n\n50:35.060 --> 50:40.060\n crazy world we live in looks like if we were to understand\n\n50:41.860 --> 50:44.740\n where every piece of this system was at any given time\n\n50:44.740 --> 50:47.300\n and we understand the laws of motion,\n\n50:47.300 --> 50:49.740\n how everything worked,\n\n50:49.740 --> 50:52.420\n if we could compute all of that information somehow,\n\n50:52.420 --> 50:55.040\n which we will never be able to do,\n\n50:55.040 --> 51:00.040\n we would, every decision you will ever make\n\n51:00.500 --> 51:03.020\n could be predicted by that computer.\n\n51:03.020 --> 51:05.580\n That doesn't mean that your decisions are illegitimate.\n\n51:05.580 --> 51:08.040\n You are really making those decisions,\n\n51:08.040 --> 51:10.980\n but with a completely predictable outcome.\n\n51:10.980 --> 51:14.580\n So I'm just sort of a little bit high at the moment\n\n51:14.580 --> 51:19.420\n on the poetry of a system within a system\n\n51:19.420 --> 51:21.260\n that has no freedom.\n\n51:21.260 --> 51:25.640\n So the human experience is the system we've created.\n\n51:25.640 --> 51:27.240\n Within the system that has no freedom,\n\n51:27.240 --> 51:29.180\n but that system that we've created\n\n51:30.140 --> 51:35.140\n has a feeling of freedom that, to us,\n\n51:35.540 --> 51:40.540\n ants feels as much more real than the physics,\n\n51:44.660 --> 51:48.940\n as we understand it, of the underlying base system.\n\n51:48.940 --> 51:51.460\n So it's almost like not important\n\n51:51.460 --> 51:53.780\n what the physics of the base system is,\n\n51:53.780 --> 51:56.100\n that for what we've created,\n\n51:56.100 --> 52:01.100\n the nature of the human experience is there is a free will.\n\n52:02.500 --> 52:06.540\n Or there is something that feels close enough to a free will\n\n52:06.540 --> 52:11.540\n that it may not be worth spending too much time\n\n52:14.140 --> 52:16.940\n on the fact that it's something of an illusion.\n\n52:16.940 --> 52:19.300\n We will never build a computer that knows everything\n\n52:19.300 --> 52:23.340\n about every piece of the universe at a given time.\n\n52:23.340 --> 52:25.540\n And so for all intensive purposes,\n\n52:26.640 --> 52:28.700\n our decisions are up to us.\n\n52:28.700 --> 52:30.900\n We just happen to know that their outcomes\n\n52:30.900 --> 52:33.420\n could be predicted with enough information.\n\n52:33.420 --> 52:36.380\n So speaking of supercomputers,\n\n52:36.380 --> 52:37.780\n they can predict every single thing\n\n52:37.780 --> 52:40.620\n about what's going to ever happen.\n\n52:41.620 --> 52:46.420\n What do you think about the philosophical thought experiment\n\n52:46.420 --> 52:48.900\n of us living in a simulation?\n\n52:48.900 --> 52:52.100\n Do you often find yourself pondering\n\n52:52.100 --> 52:54.780\n of us living in a simulation of this question?\n\n52:54.780 --> 52:57.980\n Do you think it is at all a useful thought experiment?\n\n52:57.980 --> 53:02.020\n I think it's very easy to become fascinated\n\n53:02.020 --> 53:03.900\n with all of these possibilities,\n\n53:03.900 --> 53:07.460\n and they're completely legitimate possibilities.\n\n53:10.140 --> 53:15.140\n Is there some validity to solipsism?\n\n53:15.140 --> 53:18.420\n Well, it can never be falsified or disproven.\n\n53:18.420 --> 53:22.420\n So, I mean, sure, you could be a figment of my imagination.\n\n53:24.820 --> 53:27.500\n It doesn't mean that I will act according\n\n53:27.500 --> 53:28.900\n to this possibility.\n\n53:28.900 --> 53:30.700\n I'm not gonna call you mean names.\n\n53:30.700 --> 53:34.220\n And just to test the system,\n\n53:34.220 --> 53:37.220\n to see how robust it is to distortions.\n\n53:37.220 --> 53:40.620\n Yeah, so, I mean, all of these existential\n\n53:40.620 --> 53:42.660\n thought experiments are completely possible.\n\n53:42.660 --> 53:45.420\n We could be brains in jars.\n\n53:45.420 --> 53:50.420\n It doesn't mean that our experience will feel any less valid.\n\n53:51.540 --> 53:53.820\n And so it doesn't make a difference to me\n\n53:53.820 --> 53:58.820\n if you are some number of ones and zeros,\n\n53:59.580 --> 54:02.500\n or you are a figment of my imagination,\n\n54:02.500 --> 54:05.820\n which lives in a stored away brain.\n\n54:06.820 --> 54:10.540\n It will never really change my experience\n\n54:10.540 --> 54:12.540\n knowing that that's a possibility.\n\n54:12.540 --> 54:17.540\n And so I try to avoid making decisions\n\n54:19.500 --> 54:21.860\n based on such contemplations.\n\n54:21.860 --> 54:25.340\n If we take this previous issue of free will,\n\n54:27.180 --> 54:32.180\n I could decide that because I have no choice in my life,\n\n54:34.220 --> 54:39.220\n if I lie around in bed all day and eat chips,\n\n54:39.340 --> 54:41.140\n I was destined to do that thing.\n\n54:41.140 --> 54:43.100\n And if I make that decision, then I was destined\n\n54:43.100 --> 54:44.180\n to do that thing.\n\n54:44.180 --> 54:47.060\n It would be a really poor decision for me to make.\n\n54:47.060 --> 54:51.220\n I have school and a dozen commitments.\n\n54:51.220 --> 54:53.700\n There's somebody listening to this right now,\n\n54:53.700 --> 54:56.460\n probably hundreds of people sitting down,\n\n54:56.460 --> 54:59.020\n eating chips and feeling terrible about them.\n\n54:59.020 --> 55:00.580\n So how dare you, sir?\n\n55:00.580 --> 55:02.380\n If they're listening to this,\n\n55:02.380 --> 55:07.380\n they're clearly curious about possibilities of thought.\n\n55:07.380 --> 55:10.780\n It's not the bed and the chips that makes the man.\n\n55:10.780 --> 55:13.540\n It's not the bed or the chips that makes the man.\n\n55:13.540 --> 55:16.300\n Yet another quotable from Zev Weinstein.\n\n55:16.300 --> 55:17.140\n Okay.\n\n55:18.580 --> 55:21.220\n But you don't think of it as a useful thought experiment\n\n55:21.220 --> 55:26.220\n from an engineering perspective of virtual reality,\n\n55:26.220 --> 55:28.020\n of thinking how we can create\n\n55:28.020 --> 55:30.140\n further and further immersive worlds.\n\n55:30.140 --> 55:32.380\n Like would it be possible to create worlds\n\n55:32.380 --> 55:35.220\n that are so immersive that we would rather live\n\n55:35.220 --> 55:38.060\n in that world versus the real world?\n\n55:38.060 --> 55:40.420\n I mean, that's another possible trajectory\n\n55:40.420 --> 55:42.820\n of the world that you're growing up in\n\n55:42.820 --> 55:47.340\n is we're more and more immersing ourselves\n\n55:47.340 --> 55:48.780\n into the digital world.\n\n55:48.780 --> 55:51.260\n For now it's screens and looking at the screens\n\n55:51.260 --> 55:52.900\n and socializing on the screens.\n\n55:52.900 --> 55:55.220\n But it's possible to potentially create a world\n\n55:55.220 --> 55:58.940\n that's also visually for all of our human senses\n\n55:58.940 --> 56:01.940\n as immersive as the physical world.\n\n56:01.940 --> 56:06.100\n And then, you know, to me it's an engineering question\n\n56:06.100 --> 56:08.580\n of how difficult is it to create a world\n\n56:08.580 --> 56:11.660\n that's as immersive and more fun\n\n56:11.660 --> 56:14.540\n than the world we currently live in.\n\n56:14.540 --> 56:16.780\n It's a terrifying concept and I hate to say it.\n\n56:16.780 --> 56:20.300\n We might live happier lives in a virtual reality headset\n\n56:20.300 --> 56:24.100\n 30 years from now than we are currently living.\n\n56:24.100 --> 56:27.500\n This future, the digital future, worries you.\n\n56:28.460 --> 56:29.700\n It worries me.\n\n56:29.700 --> 56:34.700\n On the other hand, it may be a better alternative\n\n56:34.900 --> 56:39.900\n to fighting for whatever people are clinging onto\n\n56:40.660 --> 56:44.940\n in our non virtual world or at least the world\n\n56:44.940 --> 56:47.380\n that we don't yet know is virtual.\n\n56:47.380 --> 56:49.140\n So embrace the future.\n\n56:49.140 --> 56:52.460\n We've been talking a lot about thinkers.\n\n56:52.460 --> 56:59.780\n Now, in the broad definition of philosophy,\n\n56:59.780 --> 57:03.540\n you kind of included innovators of all form.\n\n57:03.540 --> 57:06.060\n Do you find it useful to draw a distinction\n\n57:06.060 --> 57:08.020\n between thinkers and doers?\n\n57:08.020 --> 57:13.020\n I think that the most important gift we've ever been given\n\n57:13.980 --> 57:18.100\n is our ability to observe the universe\n\n57:18.100 --> 57:21.660\n and think deductively about whatever principles,\n\n57:21.660 --> 57:23.820\n transcend humanity.\n\n57:23.820 --> 57:28.820\n Because as we discussed, that's the closest thing\n\n57:28.820 --> 57:32.300\n we will ever have to a universal experience\n\n57:32.300 --> 57:36.940\n is understanding things, which must be true everywhere.\n\n57:36.940 --> 57:41.940\n In order for that, so I think if we're deciding\n\n57:42.580 --> 57:46.100\n that life is meaningful and the human experience\n\n57:46.100 --> 57:50.220\n is meaningful, you could make a very convincing argument\n\n57:50.220 --> 57:54.140\n that its greatest meaning will be understanding\n\n57:54.140 --> 57:55.660\n whatever transcends it.\n\n57:58.300 --> 58:03.300\n I think that's only sustainable if people are happy\n\n58:05.540 --> 58:10.540\n and well fed and things of market value are invented.\n\n58:14.260 --> 58:19.180\n And so I think we really need both to live meaningful\n\n58:19.180 --> 58:23.900\n and successful and possible lives.\n\n58:23.900 --> 58:28.780\n In terms of who my greatest heroes are,\n\n58:28.780 --> 58:33.780\n I can't decide between figures like Einstein\n\n58:34.100 --> 58:37.700\n and Newton and Feynman, and on the other hand,\n\n58:37.700 --> 58:42.700\n figures like Carey Mullis, for example.\n\n58:43.500 --> 58:48.340\n I think people like Einstein make our lives meaningful\n\n58:48.340 --> 58:53.180\n and people like Carey Mullis, who's probably responsible\n\n58:53.180 --> 58:55.820\n for saving hundreds of millions of lives,\n\n58:55.820 --> 59:00.820\n make our lives possible and good.\n\n59:02.300 --> 59:06.860\n So in terms of where I would like to find myself\n\n59:10.620 --> 59:14.580\n with these two different notions of achievement,\n\n59:14.580 --> 59:18.300\n I don't know what I would more like to achieve.\n\n59:18.300 --> 59:22.260\n I have an inclination that it will be something scientific\n\n59:22.260 --> 59:25.140\n because I would like to bring meaning to humanity\n\n59:25.140 --> 59:30.140\n instead of sustenance, but I think both are very important.\n\n59:31.340 --> 59:33.500\n We can't sustain our lives\n\n59:33.500 --> 59:36.180\n if we don't keep growing technologically.\n\n59:36.180 --> 59:38.620\n I think people like you are making that possible\n\n59:38.620 --> 59:42.220\n with computing because that's one of the few things\n\n59:42.220 --> 59:47.220\n that's really moving forward in a clear sense.\n\n59:49.980 --> 59:53.420\n I think about this a great deal.\n\n59:53.420 --> 59:56.380\n So I think both are very important.\n\n59:56.380 --> 1:00:00.580\n So one example that's modern day inspiring figure\n\n1:00:00.580 --> 1:00:02.780\n on the latter part, on the engineering part,\n\n1:00:02.780 --> 1:00:05.900\n on the sustenance, is Elon Musk.\n\n1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:09.420\n Does that somebody you draw inspiration from?\n\n1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:13.380\n What are your thoughts in general about the kind\n\n1:00:13.380 --> 1:00:18.380\n of unique spec of human that's creating\n\n1:00:18.860 --> 1:00:23.860\n so much inspiring innovation in this world so boldly?\n\n1:00:25.700 --> 1:00:29.500\n I know that we will not survive without people like that.\n\n1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:36.900\n Elon is a ridiculous and sensational example\n\n1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:39.740\n of one of these figures.\n\n1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:44.620\n I don't know if he's the best example or the worst example,\n\n1:00:44.620 --> 1:00:48.180\n but he is of his own kind.\n\n1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:50.860\n He is radically individualistic,\n\n1:00:50.860 --> 1:00:54.460\n and those are the people who will allow us\n\n1:00:54.460 --> 1:00:57.980\n to continue as humans.\n\n1:00:57.980 --> 1:01:01.020\n I'm very happy that we have people like that in this world.\n\n1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:05.460\n You said this thing about if we are to say\n\n1:01:05.460 --> 1:01:10.460\n that life has meaning or life is meaningful,\n\n1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:15.180\n then you could argue that it is a worthy pursuit\n\n1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:17.620\n to transcend life.\n\n1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:23.900\n Do you see that, another just, I'm gonna have to go back\n\n1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:26.300\n and sleep on that one.\n\n1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:32.260\n Do you draw some, speaking of Elon,\n\n1:01:32.260 --> 1:01:37.260\n some inspiration of us transcending Earth,\n\n1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:45.900\n of us moving outside of this particular planet\n\n1:01:46.460 --> 1:01:48.220\n that we've called home for a long time\n\n1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:50.380\n and colonizing other planets,\n\n1:01:50.380 --> 1:01:53.860\n and perhaps one day expanding outside the solar system\n\n1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:58.580\n and expanding, colonizing our galaxy and beyond?\n\n1:01:58.580 --> 1:02:01.780\n Honestly, I know very little about space exploration.\n\n1:02:01.780 --> 1:02:05.740\n I think it makes complete sense to me\n\n1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:09.780\n why we are starting to think very seriously about it.\n\n1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:14.780\n It's an amazing and baffling and innovative solution\n\n1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:20.300\n to a lot of problems we see as a world population.\n\n1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:26.140\n I can't really offer very much of interest on the topic.\n\n1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:31.140\n I think when I'm talking about transcending humanity\n\n1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:36.140\n and transcending Earth, I'm talking usually\n\n1:02:37.060 --> 1:02:41.140\n about deriving truth, and that's one of the things\n\n1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:45.820\n that makes theoretical math and physics so interesting.\n\n1:02:45.820 --> 1:02:50.340\n It's like, I really, really love biology, for example,\n\n1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:56.340\n but biology is a combination of whatever principles\n\n1:02:57.020 --> 1:03:00.700\n ensure evolution and whatever weird coincidences\n\n1:03:00.700 --> 1:03:02.380\n happened billions of years ago.\n\n1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:05.260\n So do you think it's more interesting to understand\n\n1:03:05.260 --> 1:03:07.820\n the fundamental mechanisms of evolution, for example,\n\n1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:12.380\n than it is the results, the messy results of its processes?\n\n1:03:12.380 --> 1:03:14.100\n I can't say which is more interesting.\n\n1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:17.340\n I can say which I think is more deep.\n\n1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:23.340\n I think theory and abstraction, which can be achieved\n\n1:03:23.340 --> 1:03:28.860\n completely deductively, is deeper because it has nothing\n\n1:03:28.860 --> 1:03:31.660\n to do with circumstance and everything to do\n\n1:03:31.660 --> 1:03:34.580\n with logic and thought.\n\n1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:40.940\n So, like, if we were ever to interact with aliens,\n\n1:03:40.940 --> 1:03:46.940\n for example, we would not have our biology in common\n\n1:03:46.940 --> 1:03:52.940\n if these were some sort of really intelligent life form.\n\n1:03:52.940 --> 1:03:58.940\n We would have math and physics in common because the laws\n\n1:03:58.940 --> 1:04:03.940\n of physics will be the same everywhere in the universe.\n\n1:04:05.460 --> 1:04:12.060\n Our particular anatomy and biology pertains only to life\n\n1:04:12.060 --> 1:04:15.580\n on this planet, and the principles may apply\n\n1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:17.180\n more ubiquitously.\n\n1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:20.300\n Do you ever think about aliens, like, what they might look like?\n\n1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:24.540\n I try to, when I deal with thought experiments like these,\n\n1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:29.740\n I try to keep a very abstract mindset,\n\n1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:35.100\n and I notice that whenever I try to instantiate\n\n1:04:35.100 --> 1:04:41.500\n these abstractions, I corrupt whatever thoughts there are\n\n1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:42.940\n for which they're useful.\n\n1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:45.180\n So it's kind of like the labels discussion.\n\n1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:48.140\n So, like, the moment you try to make it concrete,\n\n1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:50.220\n it's probably going to look like some cute version\n\n1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:54.460\n of a human, like, it's the little green fellas\n\n1:04:54.460 --> 1:04:56.700\n with the eyes and so on, or whatever.\n\n1:04:56.700 --> 1:04:59.340\n Whatever the movies have instilled,\n\n1:04:59.340 --> 1:05:01.980\n like, your cultural upbringing, you're going to project\n\n1:05:01.980 --> 1:05:04.060\n onto that and the assumptions you have.\n\n1:05:04.700 --> 1:05:05.340\n That's interesting.\n\n1:05:05.340 --> 1:05:07.900\n So you prefer to sort of step away and think\n\n1:05:07.900 --> 1:05:10.380\n and abstract notions of what it means to be intelligent,\n\n1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:12.700\n what it means to be a living life form\n\n1:05:12.700 --> 1:05:13.580\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:17.740\n Mm hmm. I try to, I almost try to pretend I'm blind\n\n1:05:17.740 --> 1:05:22.220\n and I'm deaf and I'm only a mind\n\n1:05:22.220 --> 1:05:24.940\n with no inductive reasoning capacity\n\n1:05:24.940 --> 1:05:28.780\n when I'm trying to think about thought experiments like these,\n\n1:05:28.780 --> 1:05:32.940\n because I know that if I incorporate\n\n1:05:33.580 --> 1:05:37.740\n whatever my eyes instruct my brain,\n\n1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:47.180\n I will impede my ability to think as deeply as possible.\n\n1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:50.940\n Because once again, it's the thing which shallows our thought\n\n1:05:50.940 --> 1:05:54.300\n can be the incorporation of circumstance and coincidence.\n\n1:05:54.300 --> 1:05:57.260\n And for particular kinds of thought, that's very important.\n\n1:05:57.260 --> 1:05:59.740\n I'm not discounting the use of inductive reasoning\n\n1:06:00.460 --> 1:06:02.940\n in many humanities and in many sciences,\n\n1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:06.220\n but for the deepest of thoughts,\n\n1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:09.820\n once again, I feel it's important to try to transcend\n\n1:06:09.820 --> 1:06:14.380\n whatever methods of observation characterize human experience.\n\n1:06:14.380 --> 1:06:17.100\n See, but within that, that's all really beautifully put.\n\n1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:22.700\n I wonder if there is a common mathematics\n\n1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:25.900\n and a common physics between us and alien beings,\n\n1:06:26.780 --> 1:06:30.780\n we still have to make concrete the methods of communication.\n\n1:06:31.580 --> 1:06:32.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.700\n And that's a fascinating question of like,\n\n1:06:34.700 --> 1:06:37.340\n while remaining in these abstract fundamental ideas,\n\n1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:39.420\n how do we communicate with them?\n\n1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:41.900\n I mean, I suppose that that question could be applied\n\n1:06:41.900 --> 1:06:45.100\n to different cultures on earth,\n\n1:06:45.100 --> 1:06:47.980\n but it's finding a common language.\n\n1:06:48.780 --> 1:06:50.940\n Do you think about that kind of problem\n\n1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:55.100\n of basically communicating abstract fundamental ideas?\n\n1:06:55.100 --> 1:06:58.860\n My least favorite aspect of math or physics\n\n1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:01.020\n or any of these really deep sciences\n\n1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:05.340\n is the symbolic component. You know, I'm dyslexic.\n\n1:07:05.340 --> 1:07:08.140\n I don't like looking at symbols.\n\n1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:12.380\n They're too often a source of ambiguity.\n\n1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:15.100\n And I think you're entirely right that if one thing\n\n1:07:15.100 --> 1:07:21.900\n holds us back with communication\n\n1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:26.380\n with something that behaves or looks nothing like us,\n\n1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:29.260\n I think if one thing holds us back\n\n1:07:29.260 --> 1:07:35.580\n it will be symbols and the communication of deep thought.\n\n1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:38.140\n Because as I said, I think communication\n\n1:07:38.140 --> 1:07:41.660\n frequently compromises thought by intention\n\n1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:46.380\n or by just theoretical inadequacy.\n\n1:07:46.380 --> 1:07:47.900\n So on this topic, actually,\n\n1:07:47.900 --> 1:07:50.140\n it'd be fun to see what your thoughts are.\n\n1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:54.860\n Do you think math is invented or discovered?\n\n1:07:54.860 --> 1:07:59.020\n So you said that math, we might share many different things.\n\n1:07:59.020 --> 1:08:04.780\n Some ideas of mathematics and physics with alien life forms.\n\n1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:10.860\n So it's uniform in some sense of uniform throughout the universe.\n\n1:08:10.860 --> 1:08:15.020\n Do you think this thing that we call mathematics\n\n1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:19.580\n is something that's kind of fundamental to the world we live in\n\n1:08:19.580 --> 1:08:24.540\n or is it just some kind of pretty axioms and theorems\n\n1:08:24.540 --> 1:08:26.700\n we've come up with to try to describe\n\n1:08:26.700 --> 1:08:28.860\n the patterns we see in the world?\n\n1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:31.740\n I think it's completely discovered\n\n1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:35.020\n and completely fundamental to all experience.\n\n1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:38.380\n I think the only component of mathematics\n\n1:08:38.380 --> 1:08:41.340\n that has been invented is the expression of it.\n\n1:08:41.340 --> 1:08:47.820\n And I think in some sense, there's almost an arrogance\n\n1:08:47.820 --> 1:08:55.820\n required to believe that whatever aspect we invent\n\n1:08:55.820 --> 1:09:00.620\n having to do with math and physics and theory,\n\n1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:05.180\n there is an arrogance required to truly believe\n\n1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:07.420\n that that belongs on any sort of stage\n\n1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:12.300\n with the actual beauty of the matters being discovered.\n\n1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:21.340\n So we need our minds and in some sense our pens\n\n1:09:21.340 --> 1:09:26.140\n to be able to play with these things\n\n1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:28.460\n and communicate about them.\n\n1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:33.660\n And those hands and those pens are the things\n\n1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:36.540\n which smudge the most beautiful thing\n\n1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:40.300\n that humanity can ever experience.\n\n1:09:40.300 --> 1:09:48.140\n And maybe if we interact with some intelligent life form,\n\n1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:51.020\n they will have their own unique smudges.\n\n1:09:51.020 --> 1:09:55.180\n But the canvas, which is beautiful,\n\n1:09:55.180 --> 1:09:57.100\n must be identical because that is\n\n1:09:57.100 --> 1:09:59.260\n universal and ubiquitous truth.\n\n1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:01.580\n And that's what makes it deep and meaningful\n\n1:10:01.580 --> 1:10:05.740\n is that it's so much more important than whatever\n\n1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:10.220\n we're programmed to enjoy as an aspect of human experience.\n\n1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:13.740\n Yeah, that's really beautifully put.\n\n1:10:13.740 --> 1:10:17.820\n The human language is these messy smudges\n\n1:10:17.820 --> 1:10:20.060\n of trying to express something underlying that\n\n1:10:20.060 --> 1:10:23.500\n is beautiful.\n\n1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:26.860\n Speaking of that, on the physics side,\n\n1:10:26.860 --> 1:10:31.100\n do you think the pursuit of a theory of everything\n\n1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:34.620\n in physics, as we may call it in our current times,\n\n1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:38.060\n of understanding the basic fabric of reality\n\n1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:41.900\n from a physics perspective is an important pursuit?\n\n1:10:41.900 --> 1:10:44.700\n I think it's essential.\n\n1:10:44.700 --> 1:10:49.340\n As I've said, I think ideation is our only escape\n\n1:10:49.340 --> 1:10:54.540\n from the constraints of human condition.\n\n1:10:54.540 --> 1:10:58.540\n And I think that it's important that all great thoughts\n\n1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:01.620\n and ideas are bound together.\n\n1:11:01.620 --> 1:11:04.580\n And I think the math is beautiful.\n\n1:11:04.580 --> 1:11:07.900\n And it ensures that the things which\n\n1:11:07.900 --> 1:11:11.500\n bind great ideas which have already been had\n\n1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:15.380\n and great discoveries together, it\n\n1:11:15.380 --> 1:11:19.860\n ensures that those strings will be beautiful.\n\n1:11:19.860 --> 1:11:22.620\n I think it's very important to unify\n\n1:11:22.620 --> 1:11:25.980\n all theories that have brought us to where we are.\n\n1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:28.420\n Do you think humans can do it?\n\n1:11:28.420 --> 1:11:30.180\n Do you think humans can solve this puzzle?\n\n1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:33.580\n Is it possible that we, with our limited cognitive capacity,\n\n1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:37.740\n will never be able to truly understand this deep,\n\n1:11:37.740 --> 1:11:42.420\n like deeply understand this underlying canvas?\n\n1:11:42.420 --> 1:11:46.180\n I think if not, it will be people like you\n\n1:11:46.180 --> 1:11:53.140\n who invent some sort of, I don't know,\n\n1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:55.300\n we'll call it computation for now,\n\n1:11:55.300 --> 1:12:02.700\n that will be able to not only discover\n\n1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:06.660\n that which transcends humanity, but to transcend\n\n1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:11.740\n human methods of discovering that which is above it.\n\n1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:14.660\n So superintelligence systems, AGI, and so on,\n\n1:12:14.660 --> 1:12:17.300\n that are better physicists than us.\n\n1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:19.820\n I wonder if you might be able to comment.\n\n1:12:19.820 --> 1:12:21.500\n So your dad does happen to be somebody\n\n1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:27.060\n who boldly seeks this kind of deep understanding of physics,\n\n1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:30.220\n the underlying nature of reality from a physics perspective,\n\n1:12:30.220 --> 1:12:34.900\n from a mathematical physics perspective.\n\n1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:37.140\n Do you have hope your dad figures it out?\n\n1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:38.380\n I have great hope.\n\n1:12:38.380 --> 1:12:41.220\n It's not supposed to be my journey.\n\n1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:42.660\n It's supposed to be his journey.\n\n1:12:42.660 --> 1:12:47.260\n It's supposed to be his to express to the world.\n\n1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:51.180\n Obviously, I'm so proud that I'm connected\n\n1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:55.100\n to someone who is determined to do such a thing.\n\n1:12:55.100 --> 1:12:58.940\n And on the other hand, maybe in some sense,\n\n1:12:58.940 --> 1:13:03.020\n I feel bad for him for having to,\n\n1:13:03.020 --> 1:13:07.140\n if he's going to be the thing which discovers\n\n1:13:07.140 --> 1:13:11.340\n some sort of grand unified theory and expresses it,\n\n1:13:11.340 --> 1:13:16.900\n I feel sorry that he will have to smudge whatever\n\n1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:18.940\n canvas this thing is.\n\n1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:19.900\n Because he's human.\n\n1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:24.820\n Really, I think I know I've seen a little bit of what\n\n1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:27.860\n I think great math and great physics looks like.\n\n1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:31.020\n And it's unbelievably beautiful.\n\n1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:33.460\n And then you have to present it to a world\n\n1:13:33.460 --> 1:13:39.020\n with market constraints and all of this messy sloppiness.\n\n1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:43.580\n I feel bad in some sense for my dad\n\n1:13:43.580 --> 1:13:45.540\n because he has to go back and forth\n\n1:13:45.540 --> 1:13:47.860\n between this beautiful world of math\n\n1:13:47.860 --> 1:13:54.780\n and whatever the messiness is of his human life.\n\n1:13:54.780 --> 1:13:56.260\n And then the scientific community\n\n1:13:56.260 --> 1:13:59.580\n broadly with egos and tensions and just\n\n1:13:59.580 --> 1:14:03.540\n the dynamics of what makes us human.\n\n1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:05.340\n He's also very lucky that he gets to play\n\n1:14:05.340 --> 1:14:07.060\n with these sorts of things.\n\n1:14:07.060 --> 1:14:09.940\n It's a mixed bag.\n\n1:14:09.940 --> 1:14:12.380\n I both feel a little sorry for him\n\n1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:14.980\n for having to deal with the beauty as well as\n\n1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:21.340\n the smudging and the sloppiness of human expression.\n\n1:14:21.340 --> 1:14:32.780\n And I think it's difficult not to envy such a beautiful insight\n\n1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:35.300\n or life or vision.\n\n1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:36.900\n Well, that's your own path as well\n\n1:14:36.900 --> 1:14:41.100\n is this kind of struggle of, as you mentioned,\n\n1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:44.020\n exploring the beauty of different ideas\n\n1:14:44.020 --> 1:14:48.780\n while having to communicate those ideas with the best smudges\n\n1:14:48.780 --> 1:14:52.100\n you can in a world that wants to put labels,\n\n1:14:52.100 --> 1:14:56.260\n that wants to misinterpret, that wants to destroy\n\n1:14:56.260 --> 1:14:57.820\n the beauty of those ideas.\n\n1:14:57.820 --> 1:15:03.060\n And you seem to, at this time, with your youthful enthusiasm,\n\n1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:07.820\n embracing that struggle despite the fear in the face of fear.\n\n1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:13.260\n And your dad also carries that same youthful enthusiasm\n\n1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:14.260\n as well.\n\n1:15:14.260 --> 1:15:18.020\n But that said, your dad, Eric Weinstein,\n\n1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:19.540\n he's a powerful voice, I would say,\n\n1:15:19.540 --> 1:15:22.060\n a powerful intellect in public discourse.\n\n1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:28.500\n Is this a burden for you or an inspiration or both\n\n1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:31.340\n as a young mind yourself?\n\n1:15:31.340 --> 1:15:38.980\n I think, as I said, there's this weird contrast of I\n\n1:15:38.980 --> 1:15:42.380\n know that he has ideas, which I think are very beautiful,\n\n1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:49.420\n and I know he has to deal with the sort of there's something\n\n1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:54.220\n you have to sacrifice in beauty when you bring it\n\n1:15:54.220 --> 1:16:00.060\n to a world which is not always beautiful.\n\n1:16:00.060 --> 1:16:04.820\n And there's an aspect of that which sort of scares me\n\n1:16:04.820 --> 1:16:07.460\n about this kind of thing.\n\n1:16:07.460 --> 1:16:13.180\n I also think that, especially since I'm\n\n1:16:13.180 --> 1:16:16.700\n trying to think about how I should appear publicly,\n\n1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.020\n my dad has been very inspirational\n\n1:16:20.020 --> 1:16:24.900\n in that I think he brings a sort of fastidious care\n\n1:16:24.900 --> 1:16:27.660\n to very difficult conversations that.\n\n1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:29.780\n What does fastidious mean?\n\n1:16:29.780 --> 1:16:35.620\n It's just very careful and thoughtful.\n\n1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:39.940\n He brings that sort of attitude to, I think,\n\n1:16:39.940 --> 1:16:42.860\n really difficult conversations.\n\n1:16:42.860 --> 1:16:45.900\n And I know that I don't have that skill yet.\n\n1:16:45.900 --> 1:16:47.860\n I don't think I'm terrible, but.\n\n1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:50.300\n The care, the nuance, and yet not\n\n1:16:50.300 --> 1:16:52.740\n being afraid to push forward.\n\n1:16:52.740 --> 1:16:55.620\n Yeah, I would really like to learn from my dad there.\n\n1:16:55.620 --> 1:17:00.700\n I think also my dad has been very important to my life\n\n1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:05.860\n just because I've always been a sort of very idiosyncratic\n\n1:17:05.860 --> 1:17:07.780\n thinker.\n\n1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:12.020\n And I think I don't always know how\n\n1:17:12.020 --> 1:17:16.580\n to interact with the world for those sorts of reasons.\n\n1:17:16.580 --> 1:17:21.580\n And I think my dad has always been similar.\n\n1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:23.540\n And if not for my dad, I don't know\n\n1:17:23.540 --> 1:17:28.140\n if I would just believe that I was stupid or something.\n\n1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:31.900\n Because I don't know if I would know\n\n1:17:31.900 --> 1:17:36.980\n how to interpret my differences from convention.\n\n1:17:36.980 --> 1:17:42.420\n So he gave you the power to be different\n\n1:17:42.420 --> 1:17:45.780\n and use that as a superpower.\n\n1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:49.060\n Yeah, I guess you could put it that way.\n\n1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:51.220\n I don't know who I would believe I\n\n1:17:51.220 --> 1:17:56.380\n am if I didn't have my dad telling me\n\n1:17:56.380 --> 1:17:58.900\n that it wasn't my own stupidity which\n\n1:17:58.900 --> 1:18:02.980\n alienated me from certain aspects of standard life.\n\n1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:05.900\n So I'm very, very thankful for that.\n\n1:18:05.900 --> 1:18:08.620\n Is there a fond memory you have about an interaction\n\n1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:13.060\n with your dad, either funny, profound, that kind of sticks\n\n1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:15.380\n with you now?\n\n1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:18.180\n A lot.\n\n1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:20.620\n Part of the reason I ask that, of course,\n\n1:18:20.620 --> 1:18:24.700\n is just fascinating to see somebody as brilliant as you,\n\n1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:28.060\n see how the people that you interact with,\n\n1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:30.700\n how they form the mind that you have,\n\n1:18:30.700 --> 1:18:35.180\n but also to give an insight of another public figure\n\n1:18:35.180 --> 1:18:39.740\n like your dad to see from your perspective of what\n\n1:18:39.740 --> 1:18:42.700\n kind of little magical moments happen in private life.\n\n1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:47.380\n I would say I remember I think I just posted about this\n\n1:18:47.380 --> 1:18:50.980\n on Instagram or something.\n\n1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:52.300\n Otherwise, it didn't happen.\n\n1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:53.860\n If you didn't post that, yeah.\n\n1:18:53.860 --> 1:18:56.740\n One person who's always sort of mattered\n\n1:18:56.740 --> 1:19:00.500\n to whatever weird life and experience I've had\n\n1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:03.420\n has been this comedian, Tom Lehrer.\n\n1:19:03.420 --> 1:19:04.740\n Do you know him?\n\n1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:06.580\n Yes.\n\n1:19:06.580 --> 1:19:08.060\n I love him very much.\n\n1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:09.220\n Likewise.\n\n1:19:09.220 --> 1:19:12.820\n Anyway, I remember I think I was five or something.\n\n1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:17.060\n My dad came home with the CD, this Tom Lehrer CD,\n\n1:19:17.060 --> 1:19:19.060\n and he told me to listen to it.\n\n1:19:19.060 --> 1:19:24.180\n And it was all of this bizarre satirical writing\n\n1:19:24.180 --> 1:19:29.100\n about prostitution and cutting up babies\n\n1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:34.020\n and all kinds of ridiculously vile content\n\n1:19:34.020 --> 1:19:35.860\n for a five year old.\n\n1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:42.300\n I think beyond just my love of Tom Lehrer,\n\n1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:46.500\n I think it was a way for my dad to express\n\n1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:50.860\n that from a very young age, he was really\n\n1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:53.180\n ready to treat me like an adult, and he\n\n1:19:53.180 --> 1:20:03.220\n was ready to trust me and share his life and his enjoyments\n\n1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:07.420\n with me in a way that was unconventional\n\n1:20:07.420 --> 1:20:13.940\n because he was willing to discard tradition\n\n1:20:13.940 --> 1:20:19.660\n for the chance at a really unique and meaningful\n\n1:20:19.660 --> 1:20:21.180\n parental relationship.\n\n1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:24.940\n So trusting that his particular brand of weirdness\n\n1:20:24.940 --> 1:20:26.940\n is something you can understand at a young age\n\n1:20:26.940 --> 1:20:28.580\n and embrace and learn from it.\n\n1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:31.540\n Tom Lehrer, we should clarify, is not all about,\n\n1:20:31.540 --> 1:20:33.060\n what is it, murder and prostitution.\n\n1:20:33.060 --> 1:20:36.060\n He's one of the wittiest, most brilliant musical artists.\n\n1:20:36.060 --> 1:20:40.140\n If you haven't listened to his work, you should.\n\n1:20:40.140 --> 1:20:44.940\n He's just a rare intellect who's able to sort of,\n\n1:20:44.940 --> 1:20:49.260\n in catchy rhyme, express some really difficult ideas\n\n1:20:49.260 --> 1:20:52.780\n through satire, I suppose.\n\n1:20:52.780 --> 1:20:55.300\n That still, even though it's decades ago,\n\n1:20:55.300 --> 1:20:58.060\n still resonates today, some of the ideas that he expressed.\n\n1:20:58.060 --> 1:21:02.900\n I will say also that I think I am probably\n\n1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:06.540\n a more cultured person having listened to Tom Lehrer\n\n1:21:06.540 --> 1:21:09.340\n than I would have been without, I think,\n\n1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:13.380\n a lot of his comedy draws upon a canon\n\n1:21:13.380 --> 1:21:15.820\n that I was really driven to research by saying,\n\n1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:16.820\n oh, what does this mean?\n\n1:21:16.820 --> 1:21:18.660\n I don't understand that reference.\n\n1:21:18.660 --> 1:21:20.020\n There are a lot of references there\n\n1:21:20.020 --> 1:21:26.380\n to really inspirational things, which he sort of assumes\n\n1:21:26.380 --> 1:21:28.020\n going into a lot of his songs.\n\n1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:29.660\n And for many of us, like me, you have\n\n1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:33.420\n to piece those things together, looking at Wikipedia pages\n\n1:21:33.420 --> 1:21:33.980\n and whatnot.\n\n1:21:33.980 --> 1:21:37.900\n But to tie this back to the original question,\n\n1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:43.900\n I think there's sort of a break it,\n\n1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:47.260\n you bought it notion of parenting.\n\n1:21:47.260 --> 1:21:53.780\n I think, really, if you're not going to accept a standard,\n\n1:21:53.780 --> 1:21:55.300\n you have to invent your own.\n\n1:21:55.300 --> 1:21:59.660\n And I think, in some ways, that was my dad's way of telling me\n\n1:21:59.660 --> 1:22:04.220\n that if I was too unstandard as a child,\n\n1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:07.740\n he would invent his own way of parenting me\n\n1:22:07.740 --> 1:22:09.500\n because that was worth it to him.\n\n1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:11.540\n And I think that was very meaningful to me.\n\n1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:13.020\n I know you're young.\n\n1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:16.700\n This is a weird time to ask this question.\n\n1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.940\n Are you cognizant on the role of love\n\n1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:21.780\n in your relationship with your dad?\n\n1:22:21.780 --> 1:22:25.980\n Are you at a place mentally, as a man yourself,\n\n1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:28.260\n to admit that you love the guy?\n\n1:22:28.260 --> 1:22:32.580\n I love my dad with the connection\n\n1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:36.180\n that I think I've had to very few things in the world.\n\n1:22:36.180 --> 1:22:38.100\n I think my dad is one of the people that's\n\n1:22:38.100 --> 1:22:40.500\n allowed me to see myself.\n\n1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:45.420\n And I don't know who I would imagine myself to be\n\n1:22:45.420 --> 1:22:46.300\n if not for my dad.\n\n1:22:46.300 --> 1:22:49.660\n That isn't to say that I agree with him on everything.\n\n1:22:49.660 --> 1:22:54.660\n But I think he's given me courage to accept myself\n\n1:22:54.660 --> 1:23:00.260\n and to believe that I can teach myself where I'm\n\n1:23:00.260 --> 1:23:02.980\n unable to learn from convention.\n\n1:23:02.980 --> 1:23:07.820\n So I love my dad very dearly, yes.\n\n1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:12.860\n Is there ways in which you wish you could be a better son?\n\n1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:16.780\n Firstly, I'd like to say I'm sure before I figure out\n\n1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:18.620\n exactly what those are.\n\n1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:22.660\n I think whenever I come to conclusions\n\n1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:28.820\n on what that means, I'm eager to take them.\n\n1:23:28.820 --> 1:23:31.020\n What do you mean by that?\n\n1:23:31.020 --> 1:23:32.420\n What do you mean by a conclusion?\n\n1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:35.340\n If I have an idea for how to be a better son,\n\n1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:39.140\n I think I'm inclined to try to be that person.\n\n1:23:39.140 --> 1:23:41.060\n I think that's true of almost anything.\n\n1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:44.820\n I think if I have ideas for improvement,\n\n1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:49.340\n it would be wasteful not to act on them.\n\n1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:55.260\n So I suppose one thing I could say\n\n1:23:55.260 --> 1:24:03.100\n is that I think idealism and what could almost\n\n1:24:03.100 --> 1:24:07.900\n be considered naivete is not necessarily\n\n1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:18.340\n a lacking of maturity, but instead an obligation\n\n1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:27.700\n to those older than us who have lived and seen too much\n\n1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:34.500\n to fully believe in what is naive and right\n\n1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:41.980\n without the assistance of the young\n\n1:24:41.980 --> 1:24:46.580\n to reinspire traditional idealism.\n\n1:24:46.580 --> 1:24:53.660\n And so perhaps instead of trying to be more mature all the time,\n\n1:24:53.660 --> 1:24:59.740\n I should spend some time trying to be an idealistic form of hope\n\n1:24:59.740 --> 1:25:04.220\n in the lives of people who maybe have seen too much\n\n1:25:04.220 --> 1:25:07.660\n to retain all of that original hope.\n\n1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:11.500\n So that's something that's difficult,\n\n1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:15.100\n but especially appearing in public\n\n1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:18.180\n as someone as young as I am, I think\n\n1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:21.300\n anything I do, which is juvenile by choice,\n\n1:25:21.300 --> 1:25:24.460\n will be held against me.\n\n1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:26.980\n But maybe that's a sacrifice that I have to make.\n\n1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:30.820\n I have to retain some sort of youthful hope and optimism.\n\n1:25:30.820 --> 1:25:32.220\n Yeah, I can't.\n\n1:25:32.220 --> 1:25:36.980\n I mean, I'm going to get teary eyed now, but I have allergies.\n\n1:25:36.980 --> 1:25:39.100\n But also, this is pretty powerful what you're saying.\n\n1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:40.420\n I certainly share your ideas.\n\n1:25:40.420 --> 1:25:44.220\n It's something I struggle with just by instinct.\n\n1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:46.340\n You should read The Idiot by Dostoevsky.\n\n1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:52.420\n By instinct, I love being naive and seeing\n\n1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:54.540\n the world from a hopeful perspective,\n\n1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:56.460\n from an optimistic perspective.\n\n1:25:56.460 --> 1:26:00.100\n And it's sad that that is something\n\n1:26:00.100 --> 1:26:03.060\n you pay a price for in this world,\n\n1:26:03.060 --> 1:26:06.700\n like in the academic world, especially as you're coming up\n\n1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:07.940\n through schooling.\n\n1:26:07.940 --> 1:26:10.740\n But just actually, it's a hit on your reputation\n\n1:26:10.740 --> 1:26:12.180\n throughout your life.\n\n1:26:12.180 --> 1:26:15.980\n And it's a sad truth, but you have to, for many things,\n\n1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:19.140\n if it's a principle you hold, you\n\n1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:21.780\n have to be willing to pay the costs.\n\n1:26:21.780 --> 1:26:26.380\n And ultimately, I believe that in part,\n\n1:26:26.380 --> 1:26:30.460\n a hopeful view will help you realize\n\n1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:31.860\n the best version of yourself.\n\n1:26:31.860 --> 1:26:37.740\n Because optimism is a kind of, optimism is productive.\n\n1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:44.820\n Like believing that the world is and can be amazing\n\n1:26:44.820 --> 1:26:47.340\n allows you to create a more amazing world somehow.\n\n1:26:47.340 --> 1:26:51.020\n I mean, I'm not sure if it's the human nature\n\n1:26:51.020 --> 1:26:52.500\n of a fundamental law of physics.\n\n1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:53.060\n I don't know.\n\n1:26:53.060 --> 1:26:55.100\n But believe in the impossible in the sense\n\n1:26:55.100 --> 1:26:57.900\n being optimistic about the thing.\n\n1:26:57.900 --> 1:27:00.900\n It's similar, going back to what you've said,\n\n1:27:00.900 --> 1:27:03.920\n is believing that a radical, that a powerful single idea,\n\n1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:09.700\n that a single individual can revolutionize some framework\n\n1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:11.980\n that we're operating in that will change\n\n1:27:11.980 --> 1:27:12.980\n the world for the better.\n\n1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:16.140\n Believing that allows you to have the chance\n\n1:27:16.140 --> 1:27:17.740\n to create that.\n\n1:27:17.740 --> 1:27:19.860\n And so I'm with you on the optimism.\n\n1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:23.500\n But you may have to pay a cost of optimism\n\n1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:26.780\n and naive hopefulness.\n\n1:27:26.780 --> 1:27:31.020\n I mean, in some sense, optimism limits freedom.\n\n1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:36.180\n I think if we don't really have much choice in choosing\n\n1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:41.620\n what is perfect, if it exists as an ideal,\n\n1:27:41.620 --> 1:27:45.620\n then there isn't much room for creativity.\n\n1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:47.580\n And that's a danger of optimism, is someone\n\n1:27:47.580 --> 1:27:50.660\n who would like to be creative.\n\n1:27:50.660 --> 1:27:54.260\n I think it was Warren Zeevon said,\n\n1:27:54.260 --> 1:27:56.260\n accepting dreams, you're never really free.\n\n1:27:56.260 --> 1:28:00.100\n And that's something I think about a lot.\n\n1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:01.380\n He's an interesting guy, also.\n\n1:28:01.380 --> 1:28:04.340\n I really like him.\n\n1:28:04.340 --> 1:28:08.780\n On that topic, you do have a bit of an appreciation\n\n1:28:08.780 --> 1:28:09.820\n and connection with music.\n\n1:28:09.820 --> 1:28:11.620\n I saw you play some guitar a few months ago.\n\n1:28:15.620 --> 1:28:18.540\n Can you put, in a philosophical sense,\n\n1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:20.900\n your connection to music?\n\n1:28:20.900 --> 1:28:24.180\n What insights about life, about just the way\n\n1:28:24.180 --> 1:28:26.060\n you see the world, do you get from music?\n\n1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:29.060\n I think the role music has played in my life\n\n1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:33.140\n was originally motivated by wanting\n\n1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:35.460\n to prove things to myself.\n\n1:28:35.460 --> 1:28:37.540\n I really have no ear for music.\n\n1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:41.100\n I have a terrible sense of pitch.\n\n1:28:41.100 --> 1:28:43.420\n And I think a lot of music relies\n\n1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:45.180\n on very standard teaching.\n\n1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:50.300\n If you think about lessons, for example, music lessons,\n\n1:28:50.300 --> 1:28:56.420\n there's a routine to them, which is so archaic and traditional\n\n1:28:56.420 --> 1:28:59.300\n that there's no room for deviation.\n\n1:28:59.300 --> 1:29:03.380\n I think all of that suggested to me\n\n1:29:03.380 --> 1:29:06.380\n that I would never have a relationship with music.\n\n1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:07.780\n I loved listening to music.\n\n1:29:07.780 --> 1:29:09.740\n It was just difficult to me.\n\n1:29:09.740 --> 1:29:12.780\n It saddened me.\n\n1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:15.900\n I wanted to know if there was any way I could build\n\n1:29:15.900 --> 1:29:22.700\n a connection to music, given who I am, my own idiosyncrasies,\n\n1:29:22.700 --> 1:29:25.580\n what challenges I have.\n\n1:29:25.580 --> 1:29:27.820\n I decided to try to learn music theory\n\n1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:29.860\n before I touched an instrument.\n\n1:29:32.780 --> 1:29:35.420\n I think that gave me a very unique opportunity instead\n\n1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:38.860\n of spending my time fruitlessly at the beginning\n\n1:29:38.860 --> 1:29:41.020\n on the syntax of a particular instrument.\n\n1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:43.580\n This is how you, this is your posture on the piano.\n\n1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:45.900\n This is how you hold your fingers.\n\n1:29:45.900 --> 1:29:50.460\n I tried instead to learn what made music work.\n\n1:29:50.460 --> 1:29:52.700\n And the wonderful thing about that\n\n1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:56.940\n was I'm pretty sure that any instrument with discrete notes\n\n1:29:56.940 --> 1:30:00.780\n is mine for the taking within a day or so of having\n\n1:30:00.780 --> 1:30:03.100\n the ability to play with it.\n\n1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:07.860\n So I think approaching music abstractly\n\n1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:13.780\n gave me the ability to instantiate it everywhere.\n\n1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:18.380\n And I think it also taught me something about self teaching.\n\n1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:22.060\n Recently, I've tried getting into classical music\n\n1:30:22.060 --> 1:30:24.860\n because, at least traditionally, this\n\n1:30:24.860 --> 1:30:28.980\n is the thing which is thought to require the most\n\n1:30:28.980 --> 1:30:35.460\n rigor and traditional teaching.\n\n1:30:35.460 --> 1:30:37.860\n I think it's essentially taught me,\n\n1:30:37.860 --> 1:30:41.540\n even if I'll never be a great classical performer,\n\n1:30:41.540 --> 1:30:45.380\n that there is nothing one can't really\n\n1:30:45.380 --> 1:30:48.340\n teach themself in this era.\n\n1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:53.980\n So I've been enjoying whatever connection I have with music.\n\n1:30:53.980 --> 1:30:56.140\n The other thing I'll say about it\n\n1:30:56.140 --> 1:31:00.300\n is that it's a very rewarding learning process.\n\n1:31:00.300 --> 1:31:07.300\n We know, for example, that music accesses our neurochemicals\n\n1:31:07.300 --> 1:31:09.100\n very directly.\n\n1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:14.340\n And if you teach yourself a little bit of theory\n\n1:31:14.340 --> 1:31:19.220\n and are able to instantiate it on an instrument\n\n1:31:19.220 --> 1:31:23.660\n without wasting your time or spending your time tediously\n\n1:31:23.660 --> 1:31:28.020\n on learning the particulars of that instrument,\n\n1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:32.300\n you can instantly sit down and access your own dopamine loops.\n\n1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:35.940\n And so you don't really need to motivate yourself with music\n\n1:31:35.940 --> 1:31:39.380\n because you're giving your brain drugs.\n\n1:31:39.380 --> 1:31:43.980\n Who needs motivation to give themselves drugs?\n\n1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:45.860\n And learn something.\n\n1:31:45.860 --> 1:31:53.300\n So I think more people should be playing music.\n\n1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:55.580\n I think a lot of people don't realize how easy it\n\n1:31:55.580 --> 1:32:01.300\n can be to approach if you take a sort of unstandard approach.\n\n1:32:01.300 --> 1:32:03.020\n And the unstandard approach in your sense\n\n1:32:03.020 --> 1:32:05.060\n was understanding the theory first,\n\n1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:08.500\n and then just from the foundation of the theory,\n\n1:32:08.500 --> 1:32:12.980\n be able to then just take on any instrument\n\n1:32:12.980 --> 1:32:17.820\n and start creating something that sounds reasonably good\n\n1:32:17.820 --> 1:32:19.860\n or learning something that sounds reasonably good.\n\n1:32:19.860 --> 1:32:23.860\n And then plugging into the, as you call them,\n\n1:32:23.860 --> 1:32:26.460\n the dopamine loops of your brain,\n\n1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:29.140\n allowing yourself to enjoy the process.\n\n1:32:29.140 --> 1:32:34.220\n What about the pain in the ass rigorous process of practice?\n\n1:32:34.220 --> 1:32:37.460\n So is there something about my dopamine loops, for example,\n\n1:32:37.460 --> 1:32:40.340\n that enjoys doing the same thing over and over and over again\n\n1:32:40.340 --> 1:32:42.380\n and watching myself improve?\n\n1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:47.900\n I think that's because music is more effective at accessing us\n\n1:32:47.900 --> 1:32:49.780\n when it's played correctly.\n\n1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:53.860\n And I think you play, I'm positive that you play music\n\n1:32:53.860 --> 1:32:56.060\n much more correctly than I do.\n\n1:32:56.060 --> 1:32:59.340\n So if you are going to sit down and play something\n\n1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:03.340\n that you've learned, that piece will be much more satisfying\n\n1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:06.620\n to your ears and to your brain than if I\n\n1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:08.660\n were to play that piece just sitting down\n\n1:33:08.660 --> 1:33:11.220\n with an instrument.\n\n1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:18.380\n But it's sort of a trade off with freedom and rigor\n\n1:33:18.380 --> 1:33:22.900\n because even if I should be spending more of my time\n\n1:33:22.900 --> 1:33:28.260\n practicing rigorously, I know I don't have to to make me happy.\n\n1:33:28.260 --> 1:33:31.500\n Well, Jocko Willink, I think, has this saying\n\n1:33:31.500 --> 1:33:33.580\n that discipline is freedom.\n\n1:33:33.580 --> 1:33:39.500\n So maybe the repetition of the disciplined repetition\n\n1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:42.940\n is actually one of the mechanisms of achieving freedom.\n\n1:33:42.940 --> 1:33:45.380\n It's another way to get to freedom,\n\n1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:47.660\n that it doesn't have to be a constraint,\n\n1:33:47.660 --> 1:33:52.540\n but in a sense, unlocks greater sets of opportunity\n\n1:33:52.540 --> 1:33:56.260\n than results in a deeper experience of freedom.\n\n1:33:56.260 --> 1:33:56.900\n Maybe.\n\n1:33:56.900 --> 1:34:01.340\n Particularly if you're thinking about discipline\n\n1:34:01.340 --> 1:34:08.060\n and method for improvisation, there\n\n1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:10.260\n are a million pieces that you could improvise\n\n1:34:10.260 --> 1:34:14.140\n with the same discipline in how to approach\n\n1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:16.180\n that improvisation.\n\n1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:23.940\n So I think it's true that discipline promotes freedom\n\n1:34:23.940 --> 1:34:28.740\n if you insert a layer of indirection.\n\n1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:32.660\n Because I think if you're trying to learn\n\n1:34:32.660 --> 1:34:35.820\n one piece that was written 400 years ago\n\n1:34:35.820 --> 1:34:38.820\n and you're playing it over and over again,\n\n1:34:38.820 --> 1:34:46.100\n there is nothing personal or creative about that process,\n\n1:34:46.100 --> 1:34:49.660\n even if it's beautiful and satisfying.\n\n1:34:49.660 --> 1:34:53.140\n There has to be some sort of discipline applied\n\n1:34:53.140 --> 1:34:55.980\n to the creativity of self.\n\n1:34:55.980 --> 1:35:01.540\n So I think that is the layer of indirection\n\n1:35:01.540 --> 1:35:06.580\n which reconciles both approaches to freedom and discipline\n\n1:35:06.580 --> 1:35:09.460\n and enjoyment of music.\n\n1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:15.260\n Discipline applied to the creativity of self.\n\n1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:16.460\n Damn, Zev.\n\n1:35:16.460 --> 1:35:18.140\n Thank you.\n\n1:35:18.140 --> 1:35:22.780\n Now, as an aging man yourself, if you\n\n1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:26.580\n were to give advice to young folks today\n\n1:35:26.580 --> 1:35:30.060\n of how to approach life and maybe advice to yourself,\n\n1:35:30.060 --> 1:35:35.220\n is there some way you could condense a set of principles,\n\n1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:38.780\n a set of advices you would give to yourself\n\n1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:43.660\n and to other young folks of how to live life?\n\n1:35:43.660 --> 1:35:44.140\n Sure.\n\n1:35:44.140 --> 1:35:49.780\n I would say that with the collapse of systems\n\n1:35:49.780 --> 1:35:55.380\n that have existed for thousands of years,\n\n1:35:55.380 --> 1:35:57.700\n whatever is happening with universities\n\n1:35:57.700 --> 1:36:00.700\n might be an example of some system that may or may not\n\n1:36:00.700 --> 1:36:02.540\n be decaying.\n\n1:36:02.540 --> 1:36:09.740\n I think with the destruction of important systems,\n\n1:36:09.740 --> 1:36:15.620\n there is a unique opportunity to invest in oneself.\n\n1:36:15.620 --> 1:36:19.580\n And I think that is always the right approach,\n\n1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:23.540\n provided that the investment one makes in his self\n\n1:36:23.540 --> 1:36:28.980\n is obligated towards humanity as a whole.\n\n1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:36.140\n And I think that is the great struggle of my generation.\n\n1:36:36.140 --> 1:36:38.700\n Will we create our own paths that\n\n1:36:38.700 --> 1:36:42.500\n are capable of saving whatever is collapsing?\n\n1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:46.500\n Or will we be squashed by the debris?\n\n1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:52.620\n And I hope to articulate what patterns\n\n1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:55.620\n I see this struggle taking over the years\n\n1:36:55.620 --> 1:36:58.260\n that my generation becomes particularly\n\n1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:02.660\n active in the world as an important force.\n\n1:37:02.660 --> 1:37:06.300\n I think already we're important as a demographic\n\n1:37:06.300 --> 1:37:07.380\n to particular markets.\n\n1:37:07.380 --> 1:37:11.140\n But I should hope that our voices will matter as well,\n\n1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:12.740\n starting very soon.\n\n1:37:12.740 --> 1:37:16.180\n So I would try to think about that.\n\n1:37:16.180 --> 1:37:19.340\n That would be my advice.\n\n1:37:19.340 --> 1:37:21.500\n It's a silly question to ask, perhaps.\n\n1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:25.100\n But a bit of a Russian one.\n\n1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:28.460\n It's silly because you're young, but I\n\n1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:31.740\n don't think it's actually silly because you're young.\n\n1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:34.420\n Do you ponder your mortality?\n\n1:37:34.420 --> 1:37:40.060\n And are you just afraid of death in general?\n\n1:37:40.060 --> 1:37:46.220\n So tying us back to our previous conversations\n\n1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:53.260\n about abstraction versus experience,\n\n1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:59.140\n which is determining our notions of our life and our world,\n\n1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:04.940\n death is interesting in that it is obviously hyper\n\n1:38:04.940 --> 1:38:07.380\n important to a person's life.\n\n1:38:07.380 --> 1:38:09.220\n And it is something that, for the most part,\n\n1:38:09.220 --> 1:38:15.580\n no human will really experience and be able to reflect upon.\n\n1:38:15.580 --> 1:38:20.420\n So our notions of death are sort of proof\n\n1:38:20.420 --> 1:38:22.740\n that if we want to make the most of our lives,\n\n1:38:22.740 --> 1:38:29.620\n we have to think abstractly and relying not at all at times\n\n1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:37.100\n on experiential thought and understandings\n\n1:38:37.100 --> 1:38:41.380\n because we can't really experience death and reflect\n\n1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:43.540\n upon it hence and use it to motivate us.\n\n1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:45.700\n It has to remain some sort of abstraction.\n\n1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:53.220\n And I think if we have trouble comprehending true abstraction,\n\n1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:58.380\n we tend to view ourselves as nearly immortal.\n\n1:38:58.380 --> 1:39:00.340\n And I think that's very dangerous.\n\n1:39:00.340 --> 1:39:07.020\n So one concrete implication for my belief in abstraction\n\n1:39:07.020 --> 1:39:14.660\n would be that we all need to be aware of our own deaths.\n\n1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:19.260\n And we need to understand concretely\n\n1:39:19.260 --> 1:39:22.660\n the boundaries of our lifetimes.\n\n1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:26.940\n And no amount of experience can really motivate that.\n\n1:39:26.940 --> 1:39:31.780\n It has to be driven by thought and abstraction in theory.\n\n1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:34.900\n That's one of the deepest elements\n\n1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:36.780\n of what it means to be human is our ability\n\n1:39:36.780 --> 1:39:41.260\n to form abstractions about our mortality versus animals.\n\n1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:44.380\n I think there's just something really fundamental\n\n1:39:44.380 --> 1:39:49.340\n about our interaction with the abstractions of death.\n\n1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:54.340\n And there's a lot of philosophers\n\n1:39:54.340 --> 1:39:59.860\n that say that that's actually core to everything\n\n1:39:59.860 --> 1:40:03.860\n we create in this world, which is us struggling\n\n1:40:03.860 --> 1:40:11.300\n with this impossible to understand idea of mortality.\n\n1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:17.300\n I mean, I'm drawn to this idea because both the mystery of it\n\n1:40:17.300 --> 1:40:19.700\n but also just from the human experience perspective,\n\n1:40:19.700 --> 1:40:25.300\n it seems that you get a lot of meaning from stuff ending.\n\n1:40:25.300 --> 1:40:27.100\n It's kind of sad the flip side of that\n\n1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:31.700\n to think that stuff won't be as meaningful if it doesn't end,\n\n1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:33.220\n if it's not finite.\n\n1:40:33.220 --> 1:40:38.220\n But it seems like resources gain value from being finite.\n\n1:40:38.220 --> 1:40:40.100\n And that's true for time.\n\n1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:43.020\n That's true for the deliciousness of ice cream.\n\n1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:46.700\n That's true for love, for everything, for music,\n\n1:40:46.700 --> 1:40:47.380\n and so on.\n\n1:40:47.380 --> 1:40:55.460\n And yeah, it seems deeply human to try to, as you said,\n\n1:40:55.460 --> 1:40:58.140\n concretize the abstractions of mortality\n\n1:40:58.140 --> 1:41:00.500\n even though we can never truly experience it\n\n1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.460\n because that's the whole point of it.\n\n1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:04.460\n Once it ends, you can't experience it.\n\n1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:05.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:05.780 --> 1:41:07.900\n Again, another ridiculous question.\n\n1:41:07.900 --> 1:41:10.860\n OK.\n\n1:41:10.860 --> 1:41:13.020\n What do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n1:41:13.020 --> 1:41:14.900\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n1:41:14.900 --> 1:41:20.700\n From your deep thinking about this world,\n\n1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:22.660\n is there a good way to answer any\n\n1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:26.620\n of the why questions about this existence here on Earth?\n\n1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:28.860\n And as I said, we're here in part by principle\n\n1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:30.980\n and in part by accident.\n\n1:41:30.980 --> 1:41:36.180\n And a lot of the things which bring us joy\n\n1:41:36.180 --> 1:41:39.300\n are programmed to bring us joy to ensure\n\n1:41:39.300 --> 1:41:42.300\n our evolutionary success.\n\n1:41:42.300 --> 1:41:51.060\n And so I would not necessarily consider\n\n1:41:51.060 --> 1:41:57.260\n all of the things which bring us joy to be meaningful.\n\n1:41:57.260 --> 1:42:03.180\n I think they play a very obvious role and a clear pattern,\n\n1:42:03.180 --> 1:42:06.140\n and we don't have much choice in that.\n\n1:42:06.140 --> 1:42:10.980\n I think that outrules the idea of joy\n\n1:42:10.980 --> 1:42:13.020\n being the meaning of life.\n\n1:42:13.020 --> 1:42:19.900\n I think it's a nice thing we get to have,\n\n1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:22.340\n even if it's not inherently meaningful.\n\n1:42:22.340 --> 1:42:36.620\n I think the most wonderful thing that we have ever been given\n\n1:42:36.620 --> 1:42:42.180\n has been our ability to, as I said,\n\n1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:47.860\n observe what transcends us as humans.\n\n1:42:47.860 --> 1:42:52.060\n And I think to live a meaningful life is to see that\n\n1:42:52.060 --> 1:42:56.180\n and hopefully contribute to that.\n\n1:42:56.180 --> 1:42:58.900\n So to try to understand what makes us human\n\n1:42:58.900 --> 1:43:03.540\n and to transcend that and in some small way contribute to it\n\n1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:05.500\n in the finite time we have here.\n\n1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:08.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:11.780 --> 1:43:13.220\n Those are some powerful words.\n\n1:43:13.220 --> 1:43:13.740\n Thank you.\n\n1:43:13.740 --> 1:43:15.980\n You're a truly special human being.\n\n1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:17.620\n It's really an honor to talk to you.\n\n1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:23.180\n I can't, I'm just, I'm a newborn fan of yours\n\n1:43:23.180 --> 1:43:25.540\n and I can't wait to see how you push the world.\n\n1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:30.420\n Please embrace the fear you feel and be bold.\n\n1:43:30.420 --> 1:43:34.980\n And I think you will do some special things in this world.\n\n1:43:34.980 --> 1:43:37.620\n I'm confident if the world doesn't destroy you\n\n1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:38.660\n and I hope it doesn't.\n\n1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:41.300\n Be strong, be brave.\n\n1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:42.580\n You're an inspiration.\n\n1:43:42.580 --> 1:43:44.220\n Keep doing your thing.\n\n1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:46.060\n And thanks for
