author of many amazing books on physics,\n\n00:08.120 --> 00:11.500\n including his latest, Until the End of Time,\n\n00:11.500 --> 00:14.440\n Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning\n\n00:14.440 --> 00:16.880\n in an Evolving Universe.\n\n00:16.880 --> 00:19.100\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:19.100 --> 00:21.180\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:21.180 --> 00:22.420\n in the description.\n\n00:22.420 --> 00:26.260\n And now, here's my conversation with Brian Greene.\n\n00:27.240 --> 00:29.940\n In your most recent book, Until the End of Time,\n\n00:29.940 --> 00:32.620\n you quote Bertrand Russell from a debate he had\n\n00:32.620 --> 00:34.880\n about God in 1948.\n\n00:34.880 --> 00:36.080\n He says, quote,\n\n00:37.560 --> 00:39.460\n \"'So far as scientific evidence goes,\n\n00:39.460 --> 00:42.340\n \"'the universe has crawled by slow stages\n\n00:42.340 --> 00:45.600\n \"'to a somewhat pitiful result on this earth,\n\n00:45.600 --> 00:48.820\n \"'and is going to crawl by still more pitiful stages\n\n00:48.820 --> 00:51.220\n \"'to a condition of universal death.\n\n00:52.420 --> 00:54.980\n \"'If this is to be taken as evidence of purpose,\n\n00:54.980 --> 00:57.680\n \"'I can only say that the purpose is one\n\n00:57.680 --> 00:59.520\n \"'that does not appeal to me.\n\n00:59.520 --> 01:01.220\n \"'I see no reason, therefore,\n\n01:01.220 --> 01:03.360\n \"'to believe in any sort of God.'\"\n\n01:04.820 --> 01:06.980\n That's quite a depressing statement.\n\n01:06.980 --> 01:09.900\n As you say, this is a bleak outlook on our universe\n\n01:09.900 --> 01:12.380\n and the emergence of human consciousness.\n\n01:12.380 --> 01:15.900\n So let me ask, what is the more hopeful perspective\n\n01:15.900 --> 01:17.200\n to take on this story?\n\n01:18.140 --> 01:19.860\n Well, I think the more hopeful perspective\n\n01:19.860 --> 01:23.420\n is to more fully understand\n\n01:25.060 --> 01:28.340\n what was driving Bertrand Russell to this perspective,\n\n01:28.340 --> 01:32.700\n and then to see it within a broader context.\n\n01:32.700 --> 01:34.700\n And really, that's, in some sense,\n\n01:34.700 --> 01:37.500\n what my book, Until the End of Time, is all about.\n\n01:37.500 --> 01:41.740\n But in brief, I would say that there's a lot of truth\n\n01:41.740 --> 01:43.700\n to what Bertrand Russell was saying there.\n\n01:43.700 --> 01:45.700\n When you look at the second law of thermodynamics,\n\n01:45.700 --> 01:48.140\n which is the underlying scientific idea\n\n01:48.140 --> 01:51.660\n that's driving this notion that everything's gonna wither,\n\n01:51.660 --> 01:55.140\n decay, fall apart, yeah, that's true.\n\n01:55.140 --> 01:57.240\n Second law of thermodynamics establishes\n\n01:57.240 --> 02:00.900\n that disorder, entropy, in aggregate,\n\n02:00.900 --> 02:02.620\n is always on the rise.\n\n02:02.620 --> 02:05.980\n And that is indeed interpretable\n\n02:05.980 --> 02:07.620\n as disintegration and destruction\n\n02:07.620 --> 02:09.580\n over sufficiently long timescales.\n\n02:09.580 --> 02:12.460\n But my view is, when you recognize\n\n02:12.460 --> 02:14.980\n how special that makes us,\n\n02:14.980 --> 02:18.560\n that we are these exquisitely ordered configurations\n\n02:18.560 --> 02:22.100\n of particles that only will last for a blink of an eye\n\n02:22.100 --> 02:25.420\n in cosmological time like terms,\n\n02:25.420 --> 02:27.380\n the fact that we're here and we can do what we do,\n\n02:27.380 --> 02:30.900\n to me, that's just really something\n\n02:30.900 --> 02:34.180\n that inspires gratitude and wonder\n\n02:34.180 --> 02:38.020\n and a sense of deep purpose\n\n02:38.020 --> 02:42.100\n by virtue of being these unique collections of entities\n\n02:42.100 --> 02:44.640\n that happen to rise up, look around,\n\n02:44.640 --> 02:46.500\n and try to figure out where we are\n\n02:46.500 --> 02:48.540\n and what the heck we should do with our time.\n\n02:48.540 --> 02:51.740\n So it's not that I would disagree with Bertrand Russell\n\n02:51.740 --> 02:56.740\n in terms of the basic physics and the basic unfolding,\n\n02:58.260 --> 03:00.580\n but I think it's really a matter of the slant\n\n03:00.580 --> 03:02.820\n that you take on what it means for us.\n\n03:04.460 --> 03:06.700\n So maybe we'll skip around a bit,\n\n03:06.700 --> 03:09.020\n but let me ask the biggest possible question then.\n\n03:09.020 --> 03:10.260\n You said purpose.\n\n03:10.260 --> 03:12.500\n So what's the meaning of it all then?\n\n03:12.500 --> 03:17.500\n Is there a meaning to life that we can take from this,\n\n03:17.500 --> 03:22.180\n from this brief emergence of complexity\n\n03:22.180 --> 03:24.260\n that arises from simple things\n\n03:24.260 --> 03:26.860\n and then goes into a heat death\n\n03:26.860 --> 03:29.780\n that is once again returns to simple things\n\n03:29.780 --> 03:33.040\n as the march of the second law of thermodynamics goes on?\n\n03:33.040 --> 03:33.880\n I think there is,\n\n03:33.880 --> 03:36.620\n but I don't think it's a universal answer.\n\n03:36.620 --> 03:39.340\n And so I think throughout the ages,\n\n03:39.340 --> 03:44.340\n there has been a kind of quest for some final way\n\n03:44.340 --> 03:47.660\n of articulating meaning and purpose,\n\n03:47.660 --> 03:50.540\n whether it's God, whether it's love,\n\n03:50.540 --> 03:51.660\n whether it's companionship.\n\n03:51.660 --> 03:53.700\n I mean, many people put forward different ways\n\n03:53.700 --> 03:56.660\n of taking this question on,\n\n03:56.660 --> 03:59.340\n and there is no one right answer\n\n03:59.340 --> 04:04.340\n when you recognize deeply that the universe doesn't care.\n\n04:05.060 --> 04:08.940\n There is nothing out there that is the final answer.\n\n04:08.940 --> 04:11.860\n It's not as though we need a more powerful telescope\n\n04:11.860 --> 04:14.940\n and somehow if we can look deeply into the universe,\n\n04:14.940 --> 04:17.300\n all will become clear.\n\n04:17.300 --> 04:18.980\n In fact, the deeper we've looked,\n\n04:18.980 --> 04:21.420\n both literally and metaphorically,\n\n04:21.420 --> 04:24.860\n into the universe and into the structure of reality,\n\n04:24.860 --> 04:27.020\n the more it's become clear\n\n04:27.020 --> 04:30.700\n that we are just a momentary byproduct\n\n04:30.700 --> 04:35.700\n of laws of physics that don't have any emotional content.\n\n04:36.220 --> 04:39.640\n They don't have any intrinsic sense of meaning or purpose.\n\n04:39.640 --> 04:41.340\n And when you recognize that,\n\n04:41.340 --> 04:43.860\n you realize that searching for the universal\n\n04:43.860 --> 04:47.680\n for this kind of a question is a fool's errand.\n\n04:47.680 --> 04:51.820\n Every individual has the capacity to make their own meaning,\n\n04:51.820 --> 04:53.700\n to set their own purpose.\n\n04:53.700 --> 04:57.860\n And that's not some platitude, that is what we are.\n\n04:57.860 --> 04:59.780\n Because there is no fundamental answer,\n\n04:59.780 --> 05:01.120\n it's what you make of it.\n\n05:01.120 --> 05:04.180\n And however much that may sound like a hallmark card,\n\n05:04.180 --> 05:09.120\n this really is the deep lesson of physics and science\n\n05:09.120 --> 05:11.420\n more generally over the past few hundred years.\n\n05:11.420 --> 05:14.700\n Well, there's some level where you can objectively say\n\n05:14.700 --> 05:16.340\n that whatever we've got going on here,\n\n05:16.340 --> 05:18.060\n it's kind of peculiar.\n\n05:18.060 --> 05:23.060\n It's kind of special in terms of complexity.\n\n05:23.340 --> 05:26.540\n And maybe you can even begin to measure it\n\n05:26.540 --> 05:28.900\n and like come up with metrics\n\n05:28.900 --> 05:31.560\n where whatever we've got going on on Earth,\n\n05:31.560 --> 05:35.620\n these like interesting hierarchical complexities\n\n05:35.620 --> 05:39.320\n that form more and more sophisticated biological system,\n\n05:39.320 --> 05:40.760\n that seems kind of unique\n\n05:40.760 --> 05:42.860\n when you look at the entire universe,\n\n05:45.460 --> 05:48.460\n the observable part that we can see with our tools.\n\n05:48.460 --> 05:50.620\n I mean, so I have to ask,\n\n05:50.620 --> 05:52.840\n as you describe in your book once again,\n\n05:53.900 --> 05:55.120\n Schrodinger wrote the book,\n\n05:55.120 --> 05:59.180\n \"'What is Life?' based on a few lectures he gave in 1944.\"\n\n05:59.180 --> 06:02.700\n So let me ask the fundamental question here.\n\n06:02.700 --> 06:04.540\n What is life?\n\n06:04.540 --> 06:06.820\n This particular thing we've got going on here,\n\n06:06.820 --> 06:08.260\n this pocket of complexity\n\n06:08.260 --> 06:10.180\n that emerged from such simple things?\n\n06:10.180 --> 06:11.620\n Yeah, it's a tough question.\n\n06:11.620 --> 06:15.580\n I asked that question even to Richard Dawkins once,\n\n06:15.580 --> 06:18.340\n and I already have my preconceived notion,\n\n06:18.340 --> 06:20.020\n which he pretty much confirmed,\n\n06:20.020 --> 06:24.900\n which is if one could give an answer to that question\n\n06:24.900 --> 06:28.060\n that allowed you to sort of draw a line in the sand\n\n06:28.060 --> 06:30.640\n between the not living and the living,\n\n06:30.640 --> 06:34.020\n then perhaps we would have the insight that we yearn for\n\n06:34.020 --> 06:36.460\n and trying to say, what is so special about life?\n\n06:36.460 --> 06:39.260\n But the fact of the matter is, it's a continuum.\n\n06:39.260 --> 06:41.180\n There's a continuum from the things\n\n06:41.180 --> 06:44.100\n that we would typically call nonliving and animate\n\n06:44.100 --> 06:46.660\n to the things that we obviously call animate\n\n06:46.660 --> 06:49.780\n and full of the currents of life.\n\n06:49.780 --> 06:51.780\n Somewhere in there,\n\n06:51.780 --> 06:55.500\n it is a question of the complexity of the structure,\n\n06:55.500 --> 07:00.300\n the ability of the structure to take in raw material\n\n07:00.300 --> 07:04.000\n from the environment and process it through a metabolism\n\n07:04.000 --> 07:07.260\n that allows the structure to extract energy\n\n07:07.260 --> 07:10.980\n and to release entropy to the wider environment.\n\n07:10.980 --> 07:15.100\n Somewhere in those collections of biological processes\n\n07:15.100 --> 07:19.540\n is the necessity or the necessary ingredients\n\n07:19.540 --> 07:20.580\n and processes for life,\n\n07:20.580 --> 07:22.600\n but drawing that line in the sand\n\n07:22.600 --> 07:25.540\n is not something that we're able to do,\n\n07:25.540 --> 07:27.500\n but I would agree with you.\n\n07:27.500 --> 07:30.020\n It's deeply peculiar.\n\n07:30.940 --> 07:33.900\n It may in fact be unique,\n\n07:33.900 --> 07:35.000\n but it may not.\n\n07:35.000 --> 07:38.240\n It could be that the universe is such\n\n07:38.240 --> 07:41.020\n that under fairly typical conditions,\n\n07:41.020 --> 07:46.020\n a star that's a well ordered source of low entropy energy,\n\n07:47.420 --> 07:49.120\n that's what the sun is,\n\n07:49.120 --> 07:51.020\n together with a planet being bathed\n\n07:51.020 --> 07:52.700\n by that low entropy energy,\n\n07:52.700 --> 07:55.740\n together with a surface that has enough\n\n07:55.740 --> 07:59.300\n of the raw constituents that we recognize\n\n07:59.300 --> 08:03.140\n are fairly commonplace result of supernova explosions\n\n08:03.140 --> 08:07.960\n where a star spews forth the result of the nuclear furnace\n\n08:07.960 --> 08:09.260\n that is the core of a star.\n\n08:09.260 --> 08:11.700\n It could be that all you need\n\n08:11.700 --> 08:15.020\n are those fairly commonplace conditions\n\n08:15.020 --> 08:17.020\n and maybe life naturally forms.\n\n08:17.020 --> 08:19.400\n Look, the James Webb Space Telescope, right?\n\n08:19.400 --> 08:21.780\n It's going up hopefully in December.\n\n08:21.780 --> 08:23.760\n And one of the goals of that mission\n\n08:23.760 --> 08:26.660\n is to look at atmospheres around distant planets\n\n08:26.660 --> 08:30.460\n and perhaps come to some sense of how special\n\n08:30.460 --> 08:35.460\n or not life or life as we know it is in the universe.\n\n08:35.960 --> 08:39.060\n Which part of the story of life,\n\n08:39.060 --> 08:40.700\n let's stick to Earth for a second,\n\n08:40.700 --> 08:42.760\n do you think is the hardest?\n\n08:42.760 --> 08:45.860\n If you were like a betting man,\n\n08:45.860 --> 08:48.460\n which part is the hardest to make happen?\n\n08:48.460 --> 08:50.180\n Is it the origin of life?\n\n08:50.180 --> 08:52.500\n Again, we haven't drawn the line where,\n\n08:52.500 --> 08:55.900\n as you say, the line between a rock and a rabbit.\n\n08:55.900 --> 09:00.900\n That part, is it complex organisms,\n\n09:01.180 --> 09:03.260\n like multicellular organisms?\n\n09:03.260 --> 09:05.980\n Is it crawling out of the ocean\n\n09:05.980 --> 09:09.380\n where the fish somehow figured out how to crawl around?\n\n09:09.380 --> 09:12.960\n Is it then the us homo sapiens,\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:16.460\n as we like to think of ourselves special and intelligent?\n\n09:17.340 --> 09:18.920\n Or is it somewhere in between?\n\n09:18.920 --> 09:23.500\n As you also talk about, again, very hard to know\n\n09:23.500 --> 09:28.500\n at which point this consciousness emerge.\n\n09:28.580 --> 09:31.940\n If you were to sort of took us a survey\n\n09:31.940 --> 09:36.380\n and made bets about other Earth like planets in the universe,\n\n09:36.380 --> 09:38.660\n where do you think they get stuck the most?\n\n09:38.660 --> 09:40.380\n Well, I would certainly say if we're gonna go all the way\n\n09:40.380 --> 09:42.420\n to conscious beings like ourselves,\n\n09:42.420 --> 09:45.180\n I would put it at the onset of consciousness,\n\n09:45.180 --> 09:47.620\n which again, I think is a continuum.\n\n09:47.620 --> 09:50.920\n I don't think it is something that you can draw the line\n\n09:50.920 --> 09:53.980\n in the sand, but there are obvious circumstances,\n\n09:53.980 --> 09:56.020\n there are obvious creatures such as ourselves\n\n09:56.020 --> 09:58.540\n where we do recognize a certain kind\n\n09:58.540 --> 10:01.820\n of self reflective conscious awareness.\n\n10:01.820 --> 10:05.640\n And if we think about what it would require\n\n10:05.640 --> 10:10.640\n for a system of living beings to acquire consciousness,\n\n10:10.980 --> 10:14.700\n I think that's probably the hardest part because look,\n\n10:14.700 --> 10:18.780\n take Earth and recognize that weren't for,\n\n10:18.780 --> 10:21.980\n some singular event 65 million years ago\n\n10:21.980 --> 10:25.340\n where this large rock slams into planet Earth\n\n10:25.340 --> 10:27.860\n and wipes out the dinosaurs,\n\n10:27.860 --> 10:31.380\n maybe the dinosaurs would still rule the planet\n\n10:31.380 --> 10:35.560\n and they may well have not developed\n\n10:35.560 --> 10:38.900\n the kind of conscious awareness that we have.\n\n10:38.900 --> 10:41.580\n So for billions of years on this planet,\n\n10:41.580 --> 10:44.460\n there was life that didn't have the kind\n\n10:44.460 --> 10:47.180\n of conscious awareness that we have.\n\n10:47.180 --> 10:52.180\n And it was an accidental event in astrophysical history\n\n10:52.340 --> 10:56.120\n that allowed a mammalian species like us\n\n10:56.120 --> 10:58.260\n to ultimately be the end product.\n\n10:58.260 --> 11:00.960\n And so, yeah, I could imagine there's a lot of life\n\n11:00.960 --> 11:04.800\n out there, but perhaps none of it's wondering\n\n11:04.800 --> 11:08.620\n what's the meaning of life or trying to make sense of it,\n\n11:08.620 --> 11:11.260\n just going about its business of survival,\n\n11:11.260 --> 11:13.620\n which of course is the dominant activity\n\n11:13.620 --> 11:15.620\n that life on this planet has practiced.\n\n11:15.620 --> 11:17.900\n We are a rare exception to that.\n\n11:17.900 --> 11:20.020\n And I really appreciate that you lean into\n\n11:20.020 --> 11:22.500\n some of these unanswerable questions from me today.\n\n11:22.500 --> 11:25.400\n But the, so you think about consciousness,\n\n11:25.400 --> 11:28.420\n not as like a phase shift, the binary zero one,\n\n11:28.420 --> 11:33.340\n you think of it as a continuum that humans somehow\n\n11:33.340 --> 11:37.500\n are maybe some of the most conscious beings on Earth.\n\n11:37.500 --> 11:39.140\n So you're, so.\n\n11:39.140 --> 11:40.800\n I mean, people will dispute that.\n\n11:40.800 --> 11:43.680\n Yes, I mean, well, and it's a very hard argument.\n\n11:43.680 --> 11:45.900\n People will dispute that, rocks probably\n\n11:45.900 --> 11:47.220\n will stay quiet on the matter.\n\n11:47.220 --> 11:48.780\n Maybe not, right?\n\n11:48.780 --> 11:51.580\n For the moment, they're waiting for their opportunity.\n\n11:51.580 --> 11:56.580\n But I agree that, look, even when you and I\n\n11:57.780 --> 12:01.620\n look at each other, I am not fully convinced\n\n12:01.620 --> 12:03.560\n that you're a conscious being, right?\n\n12:03.560 --> 12:04.580\n I mean, I think that you are.\n\n12:04.580 --> 12:05.420\n It's not to me.\n\n12:05.420 --> 12:07.300\n I mean, your behavior is such that\n\n12:07.300 --> 12:09.340\n that's the best explanation for what's going on.\n\n12:09.340 --> 12:11.460\n But of course, we're all in the position\n\n12:11.460 --> 12:16.460\n of only having direct awareness of our own conscious being.\n\n12:16.460 --> 12:19.820\n And therefore, when it comes to other creatures in the world,\n\n12:19.820 --> 12:21.700\n we're in a similar state of ignorance\n\n12:21.700 --> 12:25.240\n regarding what's actually happening inside of their head,\n\n12:25.240 --> 12:26.540\n if they have a head.\n\n12:26.540 --> 12:30.340\n And so it's hard to know how singular we are,\n\n12:30.340 --> 12:33.260\n but I would say based on the best available data\n\n12:33.260 --> 12:34.920\n and the best explanations that we can make,\n\n12:34.920 --> 12:36.580\n yeah, there is something special about us.\n\n12:36.580 --> 12:39.500\n I don't think that there are fish walking around\n\n12:39.500 --> 12:43.260\n and coming up with existentialism.\n\n12:43.260 --> 12:46.820\n I don't know that there are dogs walking around\n\n12:46.820 --> 12:48.260\n who've developed an understanding\n\n12:48.260 --> 12:49.620\n of the general theory of relativity.\n\n12:49.620 --> 12:50.840\n I mean, maybe we're wrong,\n\n12:50.840 --> 12:52.740\n but that seems the best explanation.\n\n12:54.140 --> 12:55.700\n What do you think is more special,\n\n12:55.700 --> 12:57.940\n intelligence or consciousness?\n\n12:57.940 --> 12:59.300\n I think consciousness.\n\n12:59.300 --> 13:02.140\n And I think that there's a deep connection\n\n13:02.140 --> 13:03.620\n between these ideas.\n\n13:03.620 --> 13:06.000\n They are distinct, but they're deeply connected.\n\n13:06.000 --> 13:10.020\n But look, I mean, to me and to, of course, many philosophers\n\n13:10.020 --> 13:11.320\n who actually coined a name for this,\n\n13:11.320 --> 13:13.060\n the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n13:13.060 --> 13:14.460\n David Chalmers and others,\n\n13:15.460 --> 13:17.780\n as a physicist, I look out at the world\n\n13:17.780 --> 13:22.780\n and I see it's particles governed by physical law.\n\n13:23.000 --> 13:24.620\n We can name them.\n\n13:24.620 --> 13:27.800\n We got electrons, we got quarks\n\n13:27.800 --> 13:29.920\n that come in various flavors and so forth.\n\n13:29.920 --> 13:33.500\n We have a list of ingredients that science has revealed\n\n13:33.500 --> 13:36.140\n and we have a list of laws that seemingly\n\n13:36.140 --> 13:37.300\n govern those ingredients.\n\n13:37.300 --> 13:41.300\n And nowhere in there is there even a hint\n\n13:41.300 --> 13:45.700\n that when you put those particles together in the right way,\n\n13:45.700 --> 13:48.260\n an inner world should turn on.\n\n13:48.260 --> 13:52.060\n And it's not only that there's no hint, it's insane.\n\n13:52.060 --> 13:53.700\n I mean, it's ridiculous.\n\n13:53.700 --> 13:56.660\n How could it be that a thoughtless,\n\n13:56.660 --> 14:00.180\n passionless, emotionless particle,\n\n14:00.180 --> 14:03.180\n when grouped together with compatriots,\n\n14:03.180 --> 14:07.300\n somehow can yield something so deeply foreign\n\n14:07.300 --> 14:09.380\n to the nature of the ingredients themselves?\n\n14:09.380 --> 14:12.900\n So answering that question,\n\n14:12.900 --> 14:14.940\n I think is among the deepest\n\n14:14.940 --> 14:17.900\n and most difficult questions that we face.\n\n14:17.900 --> 14:22.900\n Do you think it is in fact a really hard problem?\n\n14:23.500 --> 14:28.100\n Or is it possible, I think you mentioned in your book,\n\n14:28.100 --> 14:30.060\n that it's just like almost like a side effect.\n\n14:30.060 --> 14:33.220\n It's an emergent thing that's like, oh, it's nice.\n\n14:33.220 --> 14:34.940\n It's like a nice little feature.\n\n14:34.940 --> 14:35.780\n Yeah.\n\n14:35.780 --> 14:38.380\n Well, I mean, when people use the phrase hard problem,\n\n14:38.380 --> 14:40.840\n I mean, they mean in a somewhat technical sense\n\n14:40.840 --> 14:44.780\n that it's trying to explain something\n\n14:44.780 --> 14:47.660\n that seems fundamentally unavailable\n\n14:47.660 --> 14:52.660\n to third party objective analysis, right?\n\n14:53.180 --> 14:55.680\n I'm the only one that can get inside my head\n\n14:55.680 --> 14:57.740\n and I can tell you a lot about what's happening\n\n14:57.740 --> 14:59.580\n inside my head right now, it's reflected\n\n14:59.580 --> 15:02.180\n in what I'm saying, and you can try to deduce things\n\n15:02.180 --> 15:03.580\n about what's going on inside my head,\n\n15:03.580 --> 15:06.300\n but you don't have access to it in the way that I do.\n\n15:06.300 --> 15:08.100\n And so it seems like a fundamentally different\n\n15:08.100 --> 15:12.260\n kind of problem from the ones that we have successfully\n\n15:12.260 --> 15:14.240\n dealt with over the course of centuries in science,\n\n15:14.240 --> 15:15.900\n where we look at the motion of the moon,\n\n15:15.900 --> 15:18.300\n everybody can look, everybody can measure it.\n\n15:18.300 --> 15:20.940\n We look at the properties of hydrogen\n\n15:20.940 --> 15:22.660\n when you shine lasers on it,\n\n15:22.660 --> 15:25.900\n everybody can look at the data and understand it.\n\n15:25.900 --> 15:29.020\n And so it seems like a fundamentally different problem\n\n15:29.020 --> 15:32.340\n in that sense, it seems like it is hard\n\n15:32.340 --> 15:35.900\n relative to the others, but I do think ultimately\n\n15:35.900 --> 15:38.980\n that the explanation will be, as you recount,\n\n15:38.980 --> 15:41.140\n I think that a hundred years from now,\n\n15:41.140 --> 15:43.020\n or maybe it's a thousand, it's hard to predict\n\n15:43.020 --> 15:45.520\n the timescale for developments,\n\n15:45.520 --> 15:48.420\n but I think we'll get to a place where we'll look back\n\n15:48.420 --> 15:53.300\n and kind of smile at those folks in the 20th century\n\n15:53.300 --> 15:55.340\n and before, 21st century and before,\n\n15:55.340 --> 15:59.340\n who thought consciousness was so incredibly mysterious\n\n15:59.340 --> 16:03.820\n when the reality of it is, eh, it's just a thing that happens\n\n16:03.820 --> 16:05.800\n when particles come together.\n\n16:05.800 --> 16:10.420\n And however mysterious that feels right now,\n\n16:10.420 --> 16:12.140\n I think for instance, when we start to build\n\n16:12.140 --> 16:15.540\n conscious systems, things that you're more familiar with\n\n16:15.540 --> 16:19.420\n than I am, when we start to build these artificial systems\n\n16:19.420 --> 16:23.220\n and those systems report to us, I'm feeling sad,\n\n16:23.220 --> 16:25.500\n I'm feeling anxious, yeah, there's a world going on\n\n16:25.500 --> 16:28.580\n inside here, I think the mystery of consciousness\n\n16:28.580 --> 16:30.860\n will just begin to evaporate.\n\n16:30.860 --> 16:33.460\n Well, that's, first of all, beautifully put,\n\n16:33.460 --> 16:35.220\n and I agree with you completely,\n\n16:35.220 --> 16:38.500\n just the way you said it, it'll begin to evaporate.\n\n16:38.500 --> 16:41.260\n I have built quite a few robots\n\n16:41.260 --> 16:46.260\n and have had them do emotion, emotional type things,\n\n16:47.220 --> 16:49.380\n and it's immediate that exactly what you're saying,\n\n16:49.380 --> 16:52.600\n this kind of mystery of consciousness starts to evaporate,\n\n16:52.600 --> 16:57.600\n that the kind of need to truly understand,\n\n16:57.620 --> 17:00.380\n to solve the hard problem of consciousness disappears,\n\n17:00.380 --> 17:05.060\n because, well, I don't really care if I understand\n\n17:05.060 --> 17:07.300\n what can solve the hard problem of consciousness.\n\n17:07.300 --> 17:09.660\n That thing sure as heck looks conscious.\n\n17:09.660 --> 17:12.840\n I feel like that way when I interact with a dog.\n\n17:12.840 --> 17:16.420\n I don't need to solve the problem of consciousness\n\n17:16.420 --> 17:21.420\n to be able to interact and richly enjoy the experience\n\n17:22.740 --> 17:24.380\n with this other living being.\n\n17:24.380 --> 17:26.440\n Obviously, same thing with other humans.\n\n17:26.440 --> 17:27.940\n I don't need to fully understand it.\n\n17:27.940 --> 17:31.020\n And there's some aspect, maybe this is a little bit\n\n17:31.020 --> 17:33.540\n too engineering focused, but there's some aspect\n\n17:33.540 --> 17:37.780\n in which it feels like consciousness is just a nice trick\n\n17:38.660 --> 17:41.740\n to help us communicate with each other.\n\n17:41.740 --> 17:46.740\n It sounds ridiculous to say, but sort of the ability\n\n17:47.540 --> 17:51.220\n to experience the world is very useful,\n\n17:51.220 --> 17:55.160\n in a subjective sense, is very useful to put yourself\n\n17:55.160 --> 17:58.340\n in that world and to be able to describe the experience\n\n17:58.340 --> 17:59.180\n to others.\n\n17:59.180 --> 18:01.840\n It could be just a social and the merge.\n\n18:01.840 --> 18:04.500\n Obviously, animals, the sort of more primitive animals\n\n18:04.500 --> 18:08.780\n might experience consciousness in some more primitive way,\n\n18:08.780 --> 18:12.300\n but this kind of rich, subjective experience\n\n18:12.300 --> 18:14.540\n that we think about as humans, I think it's probably\n\n18:14.540 --> 18:17.840\n deeply coupled with language and poetry.\n\n18:17.840 --> 18:20.680\n Yeah, that resonates with my view as well.\n\n18:20.680 --> 18:23.340\n I mean, there's a scientist, maybe you've spoken to him,\n\n18:23.340 --> 18:25.140\n Michael Graziano from Princeton.\n\n18:25.140 --> 18:29.620\n Yeah, he's developed ideas of consciousness that,\n\n18:29.620 --> 18:31.620\n look, I don't think they solve the problem,\n\n18:31.620 --> 18:34.340\n but I think they do illuminate it in an interesting way\n\n18:34.340 --> 18:39.020\n where basically we are not aware\n\n18:39.020 --> 18:43.060\n of all the underlying physiochemical processes\n\n18:43.060 --> 18:45.900\n that make our brains and our inner worlds\n\n18:45.900 --> 18:48.020\n tick the way they do.\n\n18:48.020 --> 18:52.220\n And because of that dissociation between sensation\n\n18:52.220 --> 18:55.140\n and the physics of it and the chemistry of it\n\n18:55.140 --> 18:58.900\n and the biology of it, it feels like our minds\n\n18:58.900 --> 19:00.960\n and our inner worlds are just untethered,\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:04.640\n like floating somewhere in this gray matter\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:06.500\n inside of our heads.\n\n19:06.500 --> 19:08.580\n And the way I like to think of it is like,\n\n19:08.580 --> 19:13.580\n look, if you were in a dark room, right,\n\n19:13.980 --> 19:17.380\n and I had glow in the dark paint on my fingers,\n\n19:17.380 --> 19:20.380\n so all you saw was my fingers dancing around,\n\n19:20.380 --> 19:21.980\n there'd be something mysterious.\n\n19:21.980 --> 19:24.460\n How could those fingers be doing that?\n\n19:24.460 --> 19:25.300\n And then you turn on the light, you realize,\n\n19:25.300 --> 19:27.700\n oh, there's this arm underlying it,\n\n19:27.700 --> 19:30.660\n and that's the deep physical connection explains it all.\n\n19:30.660 --> 19:32.620\n And I think that's what we're missing,\n\n19:32.620 --> 19:35.800\n the deep physical connection between what's happening\n\n19:35.800 --> 19:38.540\n up here and what is responsible for it\n\n19:38.540 --> 19:41.420\n in a physical, chemical, biological way.\n\n19:41.420 --> 19:43.660\n And so to me, that at least gives me some understanding\n\n19:43.660 --> 19:46.740\n of why consciousness feels so mysterious\n\n19:46.740 --> 19:51.580\n because we are suppressing all of the underlying science\n\n19:51.580 --> 19:53.540\n that ultimately is responsible for it.\n\n19:53.540 --> 19:55.940\n And one day we will reveal that more fully,\n\n19:55.940 --> 19:59.260\n and I think that will help us tether this experience\n\n19:59.260 --> 20:01.540\n to something quite tangible in the world.\n\n20:01.540 --> 20:06.540\n I wonder if the mystery is an important component\n\n20:08.140 --> 20:10.120\n of enjoying something.\n\n20:10.120 --> 20:14.180\n So once we know how this thing works,\n\n20:14.180 --> 20:19.180\n maybe we will no longer enjoy this conversation.\n\n20:19.220 --> 20:21.260\n We'll seek other sources of enjoyment,\n\n20:21.260 --> 20:25.340\n but this is, again, from an engineering perspective,\n\n20:25.340 --> 20:29.020\n I wonder if the mystery is an important component.\n\n20:29.020 --> 20:31.580\n Well, have you ever seen,\n\n20:31.580 --> 20:33.500\n there's this beautiful interview\n\n20:33.500 --> 20:36.940\n that Richard Feynman did,\n\n20:36.940 --> 20:39.620\n great Nobel laureate physicist responsible\n\n20:39.620 --> 20:42.060\n for a lot of our understanding of quantum mechanics,\n\n20:42.060 --> 20:43.060\n quantum field theory and so forth.\n\n20:43.060 --> 20:46.520\n And he was in a conversation with an interviewer\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:48.580\n where he noted that some people feel\n\n20:48.580 --> 20:51.060\n like once the mystery is gone,\n\n20:51.060 --> 20:53.400\n once science explains something,\n\n20:55.900 --> 20:58.300\n the beauty goes away, the wonder of it goes away.\n\n20:58.300 --> 21:02.060\n And he was emphasizing in his response to that,\n\n21:02.060 --> 21:05.060\n he's like, no, that's not the right way of thinking about it.\n\n21:05.060 --> 21:06.840\n He says, look, when I look at a rose,\n\n21:07.700 --> 21:11.540\n he says, yeah, I can still deeply enjoy the aroma,\n\n21:11.540 --> 21:13.940\n the color, the texture.\n\n21:13.940 --> 21:15.920\n He says, but what I can do that you can't,\n\n21:15.920 --> 21:16.820\n if you're not a physicist,\n\n21:16.820 --> 21:19.340\n I can look more deeply and understand\n\n21:19.340 --> 21:21.520\n where the red comes from, where the aroma comes from,\n\n21:21.520 --> 21:22.740\n where the structure comes from.\n\n21:22.740 --> 21:27.740\n He says, that only augments my wonder.\n\n21:27.740 --> 21:29.900\n It only augments my experience.\n\n21:29.900 --> 21:32.580\n It doesn't flatten it or take away from it.\n\n21:32.580 --> 21:37.580\n So I sort of take that as a bit of a motto in some sense\n\n21:38.780 --> 21:43.780\n that there is a wonder that comes from a kind of ignorance.\n\n21:43.820 --> 21:45.740\n And I don't mean that in a derogatory sense,\n\n21:45.740 --> 21:47.280\n but just from not knowing.\n\n21:47.280 --> 21:49.700\n So there is a wonder that comes from mystery.\n\n21:49.700 --> 21:53.500\n There's another kind of wonder that comes from knowing\n\n21:53.500 --> 21:55.860\n and deep knowing.\n\n21:55.860 --> 21:59.260\n And I think that kind of wonder has its own\n\n21:59.260 --> 22:03.140\n special character that in some ways can be more gratifying.\n\n22:04.640 --> 22:06.080\n I hope he's right.\n\n22:06.080 --> 22:07.460\n I hope you're right.\n\n22:07.460 --> 22:10.300\n But there's also, I remember he said something\n\n22:10.300 --> 22:13.940\n about like science is an onion or something like that.\n\n22:13.940 --> 22:16.540\n You can peel back, you can keep peeling back.\n\n22:16.540 --> 22:19.580\n I mean, there is also, when you understand something,\n\n22:19.580 --> 22:22.060\n there's always a sense that there's more mystery\n\n22:22.060 --> 22:23.380\n to understand.\n\n22:23.380 --> 22:27.060\n Like you never get to the bottom of the mystery.\n\n22:27.060 --> 22:28.780\n But I think it's also different than,\n\n22:28.780 --> 22:31.460\n you know, I don't think you can analogize say\n\n22:31.460 --> 22:33.620\n to a magician, right?\n\n22:33.620 --> 22:35.360\n A magician does some trick.\n\n22:35.360 --> 22:37.780\n You learn how it sounds like, oh my God,\n\n22:37.780 --> 22:39.520\n that's ridiculous when you find.\n\n22:39.520 --> 22:42.780\n But nature is perhaps the best magician\n\n22:42.780 --> 22:45.060\n if you wanna try to make the analogy there\n\n22:45.060 --> 22:48.860\n because when you peel things back and you understand\n\n22:48.860 --> 22:53.220\n how it is that things have color and you have electrons,\n\n22:53.220 --> 22:56.420\n dancing from one orbital to another,\n\n22:56.420 --> 22:59.220\n emitting photons at very particular wavelengths\n\n22:59.220 --> 23:01.900\n that are described by these beautiful equations\n\n23:01.900 --> 23:03.460\n of quantum electrodynamics,\n\n23:03.460 --> 23:06.100\n part of which that Feynman developed,\n\n23:06.100 --> 23:09.460\n it gives you a greater sense of awe\n\n23:09.460 --> 23:11.700\n when the curtain is pulled back\n\n23:11.700 --> 23:14.340\n than what happens in other circumstances\n\n23:14.340 --> 23:16.380\n where it does flatten it completely.\n\n23:16.380 --> 23:18.540\n Yeah, it's very possible then say in physics\n\n23:18.540 --> 23:21.400\n that we arrive at a theory of everything\n\n23:21.400 --> 23:23.460\n that unifies the laws of physics\n\n23:23.460 --> 23:25.000\n and has a very strong understanding\n\n23:25.000 --> 23:26.540\n of the fabric of reality,\n\n23:26.540 --> 23:30.380\n even like from the big bang to today,\n\n23:30.380 --> 23:33.000\n it's possible that that understanding\n\n23:33.000 --> 23:36.520\n is only going to elevate our appreciation\n\n23:36.520 --> 23:37.360\n of this whole thing.\n\n23:37.360 --> 23:38.260\n Yeah, I think it will.\n\n23:38.260 --> 23:39.100\n I think it will.\n\n23:39.100 --> 23:40.980\n I mean, I think it has so far.\n\n23:40.980 --> 23:43.380\n But the other side of it which you emphasize\n\n23:43.380 --> 23:48.380\n is it's not like science somehow reaches an end, right?\n\n23:48.380 --> 23:50.700\n There are certain categories of questions\n\n23:50.700 --> 23:52.260\n that do reach an end.\n\n23:52.260 --> 23:54.340\n I think we one day will close the book\n\n23:54.340 --> 23:57.500\n on nature's ingredients and the fundamental laws.\n\n23:57.500 --> 23:58.900\n Now that we can't prove that,\n\n23:58.900 --> 24:01.660\n maybe it goes on forever, smaller and smaller,\n\n24:01.660 --> 24:03.140\n maybe there are deeper and deeper laws,\n\n24:03.140 --> 24:03.980\n but I don't think so.\n\n24:03.980 --> 24:06.180\n I think that there's going to be a collection\n\n24:06.180 --> 24:08.620\n of ingredients and a collection of basic laws.\n\n24:08.620 --> 24:12.940\n That chapter will close, but it's one chapter.\n\n24:12.940 --> 24:16.220\n Now we take that knowledge and we try to understand\n\n24:16.220 --> 24:19.740\n how the world builds the structures that it does,\n\n24:19.740 --> 24:23.380\n from planets to people to black holes\n\n24:23.380 --> 24:25.640\n to the possibility of other universes\n\n24:25.640 --> 24:27.700\n and every step of the way,\n\n24:27.700 --> 24:29.580\n the collection of questions\n\n24:29.580 --> 24:32.300\n that we don't know the answer to only blossoms.\n\n24:32.300 --> 24:36.760\n And so there's a deep sense of gratification\n\n24:36.760 --> 24:39.020\n from understanding certain qualities of the world.\n\n24:39.020 --> 24:42.500\n But I would say that if you take a ratio\n\n24:42.500 --> 24:45.780\n of what we understand to the things that we know\n\n24:45.780 --> 24:47.680\n that we don't yet understand,\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:50.020\n that ratio keeps getting smaller and smaller\n\n24:50.020 --> 24:52.140\n because the things that we know that we don't understand\n\n24:52.140 --> 24:53.340\n grows larger and larger.\n\n24:54.300 --> 24:56.980\n Do you have a hope that we solve that theory\n\n24:56.980 --> 25:00.180\n of everything puzzle in the next few decades?\n\n25:00.180 --> 25:03.820\n So there's been a bunch of attempts from string theory\n\n25:03.820 --> 25:07.500\n to all kinds of attempts at trying to solve quantum gravity\n\n25:07.500 --> 25:10.260\n or basically come up with a theory for quantum gravity.\n\n25:10.260 --> 25:13.260\n There's a lot of complexities to this.\n\n25:13.260 --> 25:16.260\n One, for experimental validation,\n\n25:16.260 --> 25:17.820\n you have to observe effects\n\n25:17.820 --> 25:20.420\n that are very difficult to measure.\n\n25:20.420 --> 25:21.340\n So you have to build,\n\n25:21.340 --> 25:23.660\n like that's like an engineering challenge.\n\n25:23.660 --> 25:25.260\n And then there's the theory challenge,\n\n25:25.260 --> 25:28.380\n which is like, it seems very difficult\n\n25:28.380 --> 25:31.820\n to connect the laws of gravity to quantum mechanics.\n\n25:31.820 --> 25:35.500\n Do you have a hope or are we hopelessly stuck?\n\n25:35.500 --> 25:37.620\n Well, I have to have to have a hope.\n\n25:37.620 --> 25:39.640\n I mean, it's in some sense,\n\n25:39.640 --> 25:43.660\n but I devote at least part of my professional life toward\n\n25:43.660 --> 25:45.020\n trying to make progress on.\n\n25:45.020 --> 25:47.540\n And I'm glad you used the phrase quantum gravity.\n\n25:47.540 --> 25:50.300\n I'm not a great fan of the theory of everything phrase\n\n25:50.300 --> 25:53.320\n because it does make other scientists feel like\n\n25:53.320 --> 25:55.620\n if they're not working on this, what are they working on?\n\n25:55.620 --> 25:57.500\n Man's like, there's not much left\n\n25:57.500 --> 25:58.860\n when you're talking about theory of everything.\n\n25:58.860 --> 26:01.460\n Biology is just small details we'll figure out.\n\n26:01.460 --> 26:04.180\n Yeah, so it is really trying to put gravity\n\n26:04.180 --> 26:06.180\n and quantum mechanics together.\n\n26:06.180 --> 26:08.580\n And since I was a college kid,\n\n26:08.580 --> 26:12.980\n I was deeply fascinated with gravity.\n\n26:12.980 --> 26:15.480\n And as I learned quantum mechanics,\n\n26:15.480 --> 26:19.000\n the notion of physicists being stumped\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:20.560\n and trying to blend them together,\n\n26:20.560 --> 26:22.260\n how could one not get fired up\n\n26:22.260 --> 26:25.940\n about maybe contributing something to that journey?\n\n26:25.940 --> 26:27.660\n And so we've been on this,\n\n26:27.660 --> 26:29.820\n I've been on this for 30 years since I was a student.\n\n26:29.820 --> 26:31.800\n We have made progress.\n\n26:31.800 --> 26:32.860\n We do have ideas.\n\n26:32.860 --> 26:36.240\n You mentioned string theory is one possible scenario.\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:37.520\n It's not stuck.\n\n26:37.520 --> 26:40.900\n String theory is a vibrant field of research\n\n26:40.900 --> 26:43.600\n that is making incredible progress,\n\n26:43.600 --> 26:45.980\n but we've not made progress\n\n26:45.980 --> 26:49.460\n on this issue of experimental verification validation,\n\n26:49.460 --> 26:53.940\n which is, you know, it is a vital part of the story.\n\n26:53.940 --> 26:55.740\n So I would have hoped that by now\n\n26:55.740 --> 26:58.620\n we would have made contact with observation.\n\n26:58.620 --> 27:01.620\n If you would have interviewed me back in the 80s\n\n27:01.620 --> 27:04.940\n when I was, you know, a wild bright eyed kid\n\n27:04.940 --> 27:07.140\n trying to make headway working 18 hours a day\n\n27:07.140 --> 27:07.980\n and this sort of stuff,\n\n27:07.980 --> 27:10.380\n I would have said, yeah, by 2021,\n\n27:10.380 --> 27:12.160\n yeah, we're gonna know whether it's right or wrong.\n\n27:12.160 --> 27:13.620\n We'll have made contact.\n\n27:13.620 --> 27:14.460\n I would have said, look,\n\n27:14.460 --> 27:16.020\n there may be certain mathematical puzzles\n\n27:16.020 --> 27:17.220\n that we've yet to work out,\n\n27:17.220 --> 27:19.900\n but we'll know enough to make contact with experiment.\n\n27:19.900 --> 27:21.580\n That has not happened.\n\n27:21.580 --> 27:22.540\n On the other hand,\n\n27:22.540 --> 27:25.200\n if you would have interviewed me back then and asked me,\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:29.140\n will we be able to talk about detailed qualities\n\n27:29.140 --> 27:34.140\n of black holes and understand them at the level of detail\n\n27:34.140 --> 27:37.460\n that we actually, I would have said,\n\n27:37.460 --> 27:39.820\n no, I don't think that we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n27:39.820 --> 27:42.660\n Will we have an exact formulation of string theory\n\n27:42.660 --> 27:43.980\n in certain circumstances?\n\n27:43.980 --> 27:46.600\n No, I don't think we're gonna have that, and yet we do.\n\n27:46.600 --> 27:47.440\n So it's just to say,\n\n27:47.440 --> 27:51.020\n you don't know where the progress is going to happen,\n\n27:51.020 --> 27:52.980\n but yes, I do hold out hope\n\n27:52.980 --> 27:56.740\n that maybe before I move on to wherever,\n\n27:56.740 --> 27:58.100\n I don't think there is an after,\n\n27:58.100 --> 28:01.780\n but I would love before I leave this earth\n\n28:01.780 --> 28:06.780\n to know the answer, but science and the universe,\n\n28:06.900 --> 28:11.620\n it's not about pleasing any individual, it is what it is.\n\n28:11.620 --> 28:15.000\n And so we just press onward and we'll see where it goes.\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:17.100\n So in terms of string theory,\n\n28:17.100 --> 28:20.400\n if I just look from an authoritative perspective currently\n\n28:20.400 --> 28:22.480\n at the theoretical physics community,\n\n28:22.480 --> 28:26.500\n string theory as a theory has been very popular\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:30.700\n for a few decades, but has recently fallen out of favor,\n\n28:30.700 --> 28:32.940\n or at least there's been like, you know,\n\n28:32.940 --> 28:36.980\n it became more popular to kind of ask the question,\n\n28:36.980 --> 28:39.380\n is string theory really the answer?\n\n28:39.380 --> 28:40.900\n Where do you fall on this?\n\n28:40.900 --> 28:43.220\n Like, how do you make sense of this puzzle?\n\n28:43.220 --> 28:45.480\n Why do you think it's fallen out of favor?\n\n28:45.480 --> 28:47.900\n Yeah, so I would actually challenge the statement\n\n28:47.900 --> 28:50.300\n that it's fallen out of favor.\n\n28:50.300 --> 28:55.180\n I would say that any field of research when it's new\n\n28:55.180 --> 28:58.740\n and it's the bright, shiny bicycle\n\n28:58.740 --> 29:01.060\n that no one has yet seen on that block,\n\n29:01.060 --> 29:03.060\n yeah, it's gonna attract attention\n\n29:03.060 --> 29:06.100\n and the news outlets are gonna cover it\n\n29:06.100 --> 29:09.200\n and students are gonna flock to it, sure.\n\n29:09.200 --> 29:14.200\n But as a field matures, it does shed those qualities\n\n29:14.260 --> 29:17.260\n because it's no longer as novel as it was\n\n29:17.260 --> 29:20.340\n when it was first introduced 30, 40 years ago,\n\n29:20.340 --> 29:22.660\n but you need to judge it by a different standard.\n\n29:22.660 --> 29:26.220\n You need to judge it by is it making progress\n\n29:26.220 --> 29:29.380\n on foundational issues deepening our understanding\n\n29:29.380 --> 29:31.620\n of the subject and by that measure,\n\n29:31.620 --> 29:36.580\n string theory is scoring very high.\n\n29:36.580 --> 29:39.280\n Now, at the same time, you also need to judge\n\n29:39.280 --> 29:41.100\n whether it makes contact with experiment\n\n29:41.100 --> 29:42.900\n as we discussed before too\n\n29:42.900 --> 29:45.900\n and in that measure, we're still challenged.\n\n29:45.900 --> 29:49.220\n So I would say that many string theorists,\n\n29:49.220 --> 29:54.220\n myself included, are very sober about the theory.\n\n29:54.220 --> 29:58.340\n It has the tremendous progress that it had 30, 40 years ago\n\n29:58.340 --> 30:02.780\n that hasn't gone away, but we become better equipped\n\n30:02.780 --> 30:06.700\n at assessing the long journey ahead\n\n30:06.700 --> 30:09.580\n and that was something that we weren't particularly good at\n\n30:09.580 --> 30:10.860\n back, say, in the 80s.\n\n30:10.860 --> 30:13.900\n Look, when I was just starting out in the field,\n\n30:13.900 --> 30:18.100\n there was a sense of physics is about to end.\n\n30:18.100 --> 30:21.940\n String theory is about to be the be all and end all\n\n30:21.940 --> 30:26.580\n final unified theory and that will bring this chapter\n\n30:26.580 --> 30:27.780\n to a close.\n\n30:27.780 --> 30:30.180\n Now, I have to say, I think it was more the younger\n\n30:30.180 --> 30:31.840\n physicists who were saying that.\n\n30:31.840 --> 30:32.900\n Some of them were seasoned,\n\n30:32.900 --> 30:35.820\n even if they were pro string theory at the time.\n\n30:35.820 --> 30:37.700\n I don't know if they were rolling their eyes,\n\n30:37.700 --> 30:41.780\n but they knew that it was gonna be a long, long journey.\n\n30:41.780 --> 30:43.860\n I think people like John Schwartz,\n\n30:43.860 --> 30:45.180\n one of the founders of string theory,\n\n30:45.180 --> 30:46.620\n Michael Green, no relation to me,\n\n30:46.620 --> 30:49.660\n founders of the theory, Edward Witten,\n\n30:49.660 --> 30:52.100\n one of the main people driving the theory\n\n30:52.100 --> 30:53.900\n back then and today.\n\n30:53.900 --> 30:58.900\n I think they knew that we were in for a long haul\n\n30:58.900 --> 31:01.780\n and that's the nature of science,\n\n31:01.780 --> 31:06.180\n quick hits that resolve everything few and far between.\n\n31:06.180 --> 31:11.180\n And so if you were in for the quick solution\n\n31:12.220 --> 31:13.860\n to the big questions of the world,\n\n31:13.860 --> 31:15.100\n then you would have been disappointed\n\n31:15.100 --> 31:16.820\n and I think there were people who were disappointed\n\n31:16.820 --> 31:19.740\n and moved on and work on other subjects.\n\n31:19.740 --> 31:23.340\n If you're in in the way that Einstein was in\n\n31:23.340 --> 31:26.860\n for a lifetime of investigation to try to see\n\n31:27.780 --> 31:30.660\n what the answers to the deep questions would be,\n\n31:30.660 --> 31:33.860\n then I think string theory has been a rich source\n\n31:33.860 --> 31:38.860\n of material that has kept so many people deeply engaged\n\n31:39.100 --> 31:41.300\n in moving the frontier forward.\n\n31:41.300 --> 31:43.020\n There's a few qualities about string theory,\n\n31:43.020 --> 31:45.140\n which are weird.\n\n31:45.140 --> 31:48.940\n I mean, a lot of physics is just weird and beautiful.\n\n31:48.940 --> 31:50.220\n So let me ask the question,\n\n31:50.220 --> 31:53.140\n what do you use most beautiful about string theory?\n\n31:53.140 --> 31:57.900\n Well, what attracted me to the theory at the outset\n\n31:57.900 --> 32:00.980\n beyond it's putting gravity and quantum mechanics together,\n\n32:00.980 --> 32:03.940\n which I think is its true claim to fame,\n\n32:03.940 --> 32:06.740\n at least on paper, it's able to do that.\n\n32:06.740 --> 32:08.260\n What attracted me to the theory was the fact\n\n32:08.260 --> 32:11.140\n that it requires extra dimensions of space.\n\n32:11.140 --> 32:16.140\n And this was an idea that intrigued me in a very deep way,\n\n32:16.900 --> 32:20.620\n even before I really understood what it meant.\n\n32:20.620 --> 32:24.020\n I somehow had, I mean, talk about sort of\n\n32:24.020 --> 32:27.180\n the emotional part of consciousness and the cognitive part\n\n32:27.180 --> 32:29.460\n in some, perhaps you call it strange,\n\n32:29.460 --> 32:31.940\n in some strange emotional way,\n\n32:31.940 --> 32:35.420\n I was enamored with Einstein's general relativity,\n\n32:35.420 --> 32:37.740\n the idea of curved space and time\n\n32:37.740 --> 32:39.420\n before I really knew what it meant.\n\n32:39.420 --> 32:43.300\n It just spoke to me, I don't know how else to say it.\n\n32:43.300 --> 32:46.620\n And then when I subsequently learned\n\n32:46.620 --> 32:49.620\n that people had thought about more dimensions of space\n\n32:49.620 --> 32:52.380\n than we can see and how those extra dimensions\n\n32:52.380 --> 32:55.060\n would be vital to a deep understanding\n\n32:55.060 --> 32:56.900\n of the things that we do see in this world,\n\n32:56.900 --> 32:59.740\n four, five, six dimensions might explain\n\n32:59.740 --> 33:01.740\n why there are certain forces and particles\n\n33:01.740 --> 33:03.340\n and how they behave.\n\n33:03.340 --> 33:06.300\n To me, this was like amazing, utterly amazing.\n\n33:06.300 --> 33:09.060\n And then when I learned that string theory\n\n33:09.060 --> 33:10.700\n embraced all these ideas,\n\n33:10.700 --> 33:12.500\n embraced the general theory of relativity,\n\n33:12.500 --> 33:13.620\n embraced quantum mechanics,\n\n33:13.620 --> 33:16.300\n embraced the possibility of extra dimensions,\n\n33:17.260 --> 33:19.140\n then I was hooked.\n\n33:19.140 --> 33:21.460\n And so when I was a graduate student,\n\n33:21.460 --> 33:23.780\n we would just spend hours,\n\n33:23.780 --> 33:26.260\n we, I mean, a couple of other graduate students and myself\n\n33:26.260 --> 33:29.300\n who had sort of worked really well together,\n\n33:29.300 --> 33:30.940\n it was at Oxford in England,\n\n33:30.940 --> 33:33.900\n we would work these enormous numbers of hours a day\n\n33:33.900 --> 33:36.340\n trying to understand the shapes of these extra dimensions,\n\n33:36.340 --> 33:39.820\n the geometry of them, what those geometrical shapes\n\n33:39.820 --> 33:41.460\n for the extra dimensions would imply\n\n33:41.460 --> 33:43.780\n for things that we see in the world around us.\n\n33:43.780 --> 33:46.660\n And it was a heady, heady time.\n\n33:46.660 --> 33:50.500\n And that kind of excitement has sort of filtered through\n\n33:50.500 --> 33:51.420\n over the decades.\n\n33:51.420 --> 33:56.420\n But I'd say that's really the part of the theory\n\n33:57.020 --> 33:59.420\n that I think really hooked me most strongly.\n\n34:00.260 --> 34:02.860\n How are we supposed to think about those extra dimensions?\n\n34:02.860 --> 34:05.940\n I was supposed to imagine actual physical reality\n\n34:05.940 --> 34:08.620\n or is this more in the space of mathematics\n\n34:08.620 --> 34:11.620\n that allows you to sort of come up with tricks\n\n34:11.620 --> 34:14.620\n to describe the four dimensional reality\n\n34:14.620 --> 34:17.420\n that we more directly perceive?\n\n34:17.420 --> 34:19.700\n No one really knows the answer, of course,\n\n34:19.700 --> 34:22.700\n but if I take the most straightforward approach\n\n34:22.700 --> 34:23.540\n to string theory,\n\n34:23.540 --> 34:28.020\n you really are imagining that these dimensions are there,\n\n34:28.020 --> 34:28.860\n they're real.\n\n34:28.860 --> 34:30.780\n I mean, just as you would say\n\n34:30.780 --> 34:33.380\n that the three space dimensions around us,\n\n34:33.380 --> 34:35.700\n left, right, back, forth, up, down,\n\n34:35.700 --> 34:37.900\n yeah, they're real, they're here.\n\n34:37.900 --> 34:40.340\n We are immersed within those dimensions.\n\n34:40.340 --> 34:44.500\n These other dimensions are as real as these\n\n34:44.500 --> 34:47.620\n with the one difference being their shape and their size\n\n34:47.620 --> 34:50.500\n differs from the shape and size of the dimensions\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:54.660\n that we have direct access to through human experience.\n\n34:54.660 --> 34:57.700\n And one approach imagines that these extra dimensions\n\n34:57.700 --> 35:01.060\n are tightly coiled up, curled up,\n\n35:01.060 --> 35:03.380\n crushed together, if you will,\n\n35:03.380 --> 35:06.500\n into a beautiful geometrical form\n\n35:06.500 --> 35:08.820\n that's all around us,\n\n35:08.820 --> 35:11.940\n but just too small for us to detect with our eyes,\n\n35:11.940 --> 35:13.300\n too small for us to detect\n\n35:13.300 --> 35:16.220\n even with the most powerful equipment that we have.\n\n35:16.220 --> 35:18.940\n Nevertheless, according to the mathematics,\n\n35:18.940 --> 35:21.580\n the size and the shape of those extra dimensions\n\n35:21.580 --> 35:24.940\n leaves an imprint in the world that we do have access to.\n\n35:24.940 --> 35:28.980\n So one of the ways that we have hoped yet to achieve\n\n35:28.980 --> 35:31.820\n to make contact with experimental physics\n\n35:31.820 --> 35:34.460\n is to see a signature of those extra dimensions\n\n35:34.460 --> 35:36.580\n in places like the Large Hadron Collider\n\n35:36.580 --> 35:38.220\n in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n35:38.220 --> 35:41.420\n And it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it won't happen,\n\n35:41.420 --> 35:44.700\n but that would be a stunning moment\n\n35:44.700 --> 35:46.140\n in the history of the species\n\n35:46.140 --> 35:50.140\n if data that we acquired in these dimensions\n\n35:50.140 --> 35:53.420\n gives us kind of incontrovertible evidence\n\n35:53.420 --> 35:55.860\n that these dimensions are not the only dimensions.\n\n35:55.860 --> 35:59.220\n I mean, how mind blowing would that be?\n\n35:59.220 --> 36:00.980\n So with the Large Hadron Collider,\n\n36:00.980 --> 36:03.260\n it would be something in the movement of the particles\n\n36:03.260 --> 36:07.740\n or also the gravitational waves potentially be a place\n\n36:07.740 --> 36:10.180\n where you can detect signs of multiple dimensions,\n\n36:10.180 --> 36:12.340\n like with something like LIGO, but much more accurate.\n\n36:12.340 --> 36:14.580\n In principle, all of these can work.\n\n36:14.580 --> 36:18.340\n So one of the experiments that we had high hopes for,\n\n36:18.340 --> 36:20.980\n but by high hopes, I'm actually exaggerating.\n\n36:20.980 --> 36:24.340\n One of the experiments that we imagined\n\n36:24.340 --> 36:26.580\n might in the best of all circumstances,\n\n36:26.580 --> 36:27.540\n yield some insight.\n\n36:27.540 --> 36:30.100\n We weren't with bated breath waiting for the result.\n\n36:30.100 --> 36:31.620\n We knew it was a long shot.\n\n36:31.620 --> 36:34.660\n When you slam protons together at very high speed\n\n36:34.660 --> 36:35.980\n of the Large Hadron Collider,\n\n36:35.980 --> 36:37.580\n if there are these extra dimensions\n\n36:37.580 --> 36:39.660\n and if they have the right form,\n\n36:39.660 --> 36:43.180\n and that's a hypothesis that may not be correct,\n\n36:43.180 --> 36:44.940\n but when the protons collide,\n\n36:44.940 --> 36:48.060\n they can create debris, energetic debris\n\n36:48.060 --> 36:50.940\n that can in some sense leave our dimensions\n\n36:50.940 --> 36:53.780\n and insert itself into the other dimensions.\n\n36:53.780 --> 36:56.380\n And the way you'd recognize that is,\n\n36:56.380 --> 36:58.620\n there'd be more energy before the collision\n\n36:58.620 --> 37:00.940\n and after the collision because the debris\n\n37:00.940 --> 37:03.780\n would have taken energy away from the place\n\n37:03.780 --> 37:06.540\n where our detectors can detect it.\n\n37:06.540 --> 37:09.060\n So that's one real concrete way\n\n37:09.060 --> 37:12.020\n that you could find evidence for extra dimensions.\n\n37:12.020 --> 37:16.020\n But yeah, since extra dimensions are of space\n\n37:16.020 --> 37:19.380\n and gravity is something that exists within,\n\n37:19.380 --> 37:22.780\n in fact is associated with the shape of space,\n\n37:22.780 --> 37:25.220\n gravitational waves in principle\n\n37:25.220 --> 37:30.220\n can provide a kind of cat scan of the extra dimensions\n\n37:31.180 --> 37:35.340\n if you had sufficient control over those processes.\n\n37:35.340 --> 37:38.660\n We don't yet, but perhaps one day we will.\n\n37:38.660 --> 37:41.420\n Does it make you sad a little bit?\n\n37:41.420 --> 37:43.020\n Maybe looking out into the future,\n\n37:43.020 --> 37:46.140\n you mentioned Ed Witten that no Nobel prizes\n\n37:46.140 --> 37:48.940\n have been given yet related to string theory.\n\n37:48.940 --> 37:50.300\n Do you think they will be?\n\n37:50.300 --> 37:53.620\n Do you think you have to have experimental validation\n\n37:53.620 --> 37:55.500\n or can a Nobel prize be given?\n\n37:55.500 --> 37:58.620\n Which I don't think has been given for quite a long time\n\n37:58.620 --> 38:01.940\n for purely sort of theoretical contribution.\n\n38:01.940 --> 38:06.140\n Yeah, it's certainly as a matter of historical precedent\n\n38:06.140 --> 38:09.020\n has been the case that those who win the prize\n\n38:09.020 --> 38:14.020\n have established, investigated, illuminated\n\n38:14.180 --> 38:18.620\n a demonstrably real quality of the world.\n\n38:18.620 --> 38:22.740\n So gravitational waves, the prize was awarded\n\n38:22.740 --> 38:26.580\n after they were detected, not the mathematics of it,\n\n38:26.580 --> 38:28.980\n but the actual detection of it.\n\n38:28.980 --> 38:32.220\n The Higgs particle, it was an idea that came\n\n38:32.220 --> 38:36.220\n from the 1960s, Peter Higgs and others in fact.\n\n38:36.220 --> 38:41.220\n And it wasn't until 2012 on July 4th\n\n38:41.420 --> 38:43.300\n when the announcement came that this particle\n\n38:43.300 --> 38:45.660\n had been detected at the Large Hadron Collider\n\n38:45.660 --> 38:49.140\n that people viewed it as eligible for the Nobel prize.\n\n38:49.140 --> 38:50.700\n The idea was there, the math was there,\n\n38:50.700 --> 38:52.780\n but you needed to confirm it.\n\n38:52.780 --> 38:55.260\n Indeed, the prize ultimately was awarded.\n\n38:55.260 --> 38:56.940\n So I'm not surprised.\n\n38:56.940 --> 38:59.540\n In fact, I would have been surprised\n\n38:59.540 --> 39:02.140\n if a Nobel prize had been awarded\n\n39:02.140 --> 39:04.340\n in the arena of string theory\n\n39:04.340 --> 39:07.180\n because it's far too speculative right now.\n\n39:07.180 --> 39:09.060\n It's far too hypothetical.\n\n39:09.060 --> 39:13.220\n In fact, I am sympathetic to the view\n\n39:13.220 --> 39:15.900\n that it really shouldn't be called string theory.\n\n39:15.900 --> 39:18.540\n It degrades the word theory\n\n39:18.540 --> 39:20.900\n because theory in science, of course,\n\n39:20.900 --> 39:23.740\n means the best available explanation\n\n39:23.740 --> 39:25.940\n for the things that we observe in the world,\n\n39:25.940 --> 39:30.820\n the things that we measure in experiments about the world.\n\n39:30.820 --> 39:34.320\n And string theory does not do that, at least not yet.\n\n39:34.320 --> 39:37.620\n So it really should be the string hypothesis, right?\n\n39:37.620 --> 39:40.500\n We're at an earlier stage of development\n\n39:40.500 --> 39:42.320\n and that's not the kind of thing\n\n39:42.320 --> 39:45.580\n that Nobel prizes should be awarded for.\n\n39:45.580 --> 39:48.700\n What do you think about the critics out there, Peter White,\n\n39:48.700 --> 39:52.500\n he's from Columbia too, I think Sabine Hafenstatter.\n\n39:53.380 --> 39:56.340\n Is that a healthy thing or should we sort of focus\n\n39:56.340 --> 39:59.540\n on sort of the optimism of these hypotheses?\n\n39:59.540 --> 40:03.060\n Yeah, it's actually a good way that you frame it\n\n40:03.060 --> 40:08.060\n because I'm always somewhat repelled\n\n40:09.060 --> 40:14.060\n by views of the world that start from the negative.\n\n40:14.060 --> 40:18.820\n Try to cut down an idea, try to say that's the wrong way\n\n40:18.820 --> 40:21.540\n of thinking about things and so on.\n\n40:21.540 --> 40:24.980\n I'm much more drawn, maybe because I'm an optimist,\n\n40:24.980 --> 40:27.460\n I don't know, I'm much more drawn to those\n\n40:27.460 --> 40:30.660\n who go out into the world with new ideas.\n\n40:30.660 --> 40:34.020\n And don't try to cut down one idea,\n\n40:34.020 --> 40:38.020\n but rather present another one that might be better.\n\n40:38.020 --> 40:41.940\n And so you make the first idea, maybe string theory irrelevant\n\n40:41.940 --> 40:46.340\n because you've come up with the better approach\n\n40:46.340 --> 40:47.580\n to the world.\n\n40:47.580 --> 40:49.040\n So do I think it's healthy?\n\n40:49.040 --> 40:53.020\n Look, I think having a wide range of views\n\n40:53.020 --> 40:56.600\n and perspectives is generally a healthy thing.\n\n40:56.600 --> 41:00.460\n I think it's good to have arguments within a subject\n\n41:00.460 --> 41:04.060\n in order that you stay fresh and you stay focused\n\n41:04.060 --> 41:06.420\n on the things that matter.\n\n41:06.420 --> 41:07.740\n But in the end of the day,\n\n41:07.740 --> 41:11.940\n I think it's a more vital contribution\n\n41:11.940 --> 41:13.260\n to give us something new\n\n41:13.260 --> 41:15.540\n rather than to criticize something that's there.\n\n41:15.540 --> 41:17.020\n Yeah, I'm totally with you.\n\n41:17.020 --> 41:19.780\n But it could be just the nature of being an optimist\n\n41:19.780 --> 41:24.220\n and also just a love of engineering.\n\n41:24.220 --> 41:29.220\n It helps nobody by criticizing the rocket\n\n41:29.300 --> 41:30.580\n that somebody else built,\n\n41:30.580 --> 41:34.560\n just build a bigger, cheaper, better rocket.\n\n41:34.560 --> 41:36.580\n Right, exactly.\n\n41:36.580 --> 41:38.980\n And that seems to be how human civilization\n\n41:38.980 --> 41:40.420\n can progress effectively.\n\n41:41.420 --> 41:44.900\n We've mentioned the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n41:44.900 --> 41:46.860\n I gotta ask you about time.\n\n41:46.860 --> 41:47.700\n Yeah.\n\n41:47.700 --> 41:51.380\n And do you think of time as emergent\n\n41:51.380 --> 41:53.700\n or fundamental to our universe?\n\n41:53.700 --> 41:56.080\n I like to think of it as emergent.\n\n41:56.080 --> 42:00.940\n I don't have a solid reason for that perspective.\n\n42:00.940 --> 42:02.720\n I have a lot of hints of reasons\n\n42:02.720 --> 42:04.340\n that some of which come out of string theory\n\n42:04.340 --> 42:09.140\n and quantum gravity that perhaps would be worth talking about.\n\n42:09.140 --> 42:11.980\n But what I would say is,\n\n42:11.980 --> 42:16.980\n time is the most familiar quality of experience\n\n42:17.020 --> 42:18.940\n because there's nothing that takes place\n\n42:18.940 --> 42:22.140\n that doesn't take place within an interval of time.\n\n42:22.140 --> 42:24.500\n And yet at the same time,\n\n42:24.500 --> 42:28.420\n it is perhaps the most mysterious quality of the world.\n\n42:28.420 --> 42:31.020\n So it's a wonderful confluence\n\n42:31.020 --> 42:33.500\n of the familiar and the deeply mysterious\n\n42:33.500 --> 42:35.980\n all in one little package.\n\n42:35.980 --> 42:38.580\n If you were to ask me, what is time?\n\n42:38.580 --> 42:39.760\n I don't really know.\n\n42:39.760 --> 42:41.000\n I don't think anybody does.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:45.220\n I can say what time gives us,\n\n42:45.220 --> 42:48.740\n it allows us the language for talking about change.\n\n42:48.740 --> 42:52.580\n It allows us to envision the events of the universe\n\n42:52.580 --> 42:55.860\n being spread out in this temporal timeline.\n\n42:55.860 --> 42:59.080\n And in that way, allows us to see the patterns\n\n42:59.080 --> 43:01.640\n that unfold within time.\n\n43:01.640 --> 43:05.120\n I mean, time allows us the structure and the organization\n\n43:05.120 --> 43:08.920\n to think about things in that kind of a progression.\n\n43:08.920 --> 43:11.420\n But what actually is it?\n\n43:11.420 --> 43:12.740\n I don't really know.\n\n43:12.740 --> 43:16.380\n And that's so strange because we can measure it, right?\n\n43:16.380 --> 43:19.060\n I mean, there are laboratories in the world\n\n43:19.060 --> 43:21.100\n that measure this thing called time\n\n43:21.100 --> 43:24.020\n to spectacular precision.\n\n43:24.020 --> 43:28.460\n But if you go up to the folks and say,\n\n43:28.460 --> 43:31.900\n what is it that you're actually measuring?\n\n43:31.900 --> 43:34.540\n I don't know that they can really articulate\n\n43:34.540 --> 43:37.180\n the kind of answer that you would expect\n\n43:37.180 --> 43:39.360\n from those who are engineering a device\n\n43:39.360 --> 43:41.460\n that can measure something called time\n\n43:41.460 --> 43:43.100\n to that level of precision.\n\n43:43.100 --> 43:45.880\n So it's a very curious combination.\n\n43:46.860 --> 43:51.260\n What do you make of the one way feeling of causality?\n\n43:51.260 --> 43:56.260\n Like is causality a thing or is that too just a human story\n\n43:56.260 --> 44:00.780\n that we put on top of this emergent phenomenon of time?\n\n44:00.780 --> 44:02.220\n I don't know.\n\n44:02.220 --> 44:05.940\n I can give you my guess and my intuition about it.\n\n44:05.940 --> 44:09.180\n I do think that at the macroscopic level,\n\n44:09.180 --> 44:11.280\n if we're talking about sort of the human experience of time,\n\n44:11.280 --> 44:13.320\n I do think at the macroscopic level,\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:17.180\n there is a fundamental notion of causality\n\n44:17.180 --> 44:20.060\n that does emerge from a starting point\n\n44:20.060 --> 44:21.760\n that may not have causality built in.\n\n44:21.760 --> 44:25.540\n So I certainly would allow that at the deepest description\n\n44:25.540 --> 44:28.880\n of reality when we finally have that on the table,\n\n44:28.880 --> 44:33.540\n we may not see causality directly at that fundamental level.\n\n44:33.540 --> 44:36.240\n But I do believe that we will understand\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:38.340\n how to go from that fundamental level\n\n44:38.340 --> 44:41.440\n to a world where at the macroscopic level,\n\n44:41.440 --> 44:44.460\n there is this notion of A causes B.\n\n44:44.460 --> 44:47.660\n A notion that Einstein deeply embraced\n\n44:47.660 --> 44:49.140\n in his special theory of relativity\n\n44:49.140 --> 44:51.840\n where he showed that time has qualities\n\n44:51.840 --> 44:54.280\n that we wouldn't expect based on experience.\n\n44:54.280 --> 44:56.740\n You and I, if we move relative to each other,\n\n44:56.740 --> 44:59.780\n our clocks tick off time at different rate.\n\n44:59.780 --> 45:02.540\n And our clocks is just a means of measuring\n\n45:02.540 --> 45:03.520\n this thing called time.\n\n45:03.520 --> 45:05.860\n So this is really time that we're talking about.\n\n45:05.860 --> 45:08.100\n Time for you and time for me are different\n\n45:08.100 --> 45:09.280\n if we're in relative motion.\n\n45:09.280 --> 45:11.500\n He then shows in the general theory of relativity\n\n45:11.500 --> 45:15.040\n that if we're experiencing different gravity,\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:16.300\n different gravitational fields\n\n45:16.300 --> 45:17.280\n or actually more precisely\n\n45:17.280 --> 45:19.180\n different gravitational potentials,\n\n45:19.180 --> 45:21.660\n time will elapse for us at different rates.\n\n45:21.660 --> 45:25.960\n These are things that are astoundingly strange\n\n45:25.960 --> 45:29.700\n that give rise to a scientific notion of time travel.\n\n45:29.700 --> 45:33.440\n Okay, so this is how far Einstein took us\n\n45:33.440 --> 45:37.180\n in wiping away the old understanding of time\n\n45:37.180 --> 45:40.420\n and injecting a new understanding of its qualities.\n\n45:40.420 --> 45:44.420\n So there's so much about time that's counterintuitive,\n\n45:44.420 --> 45:46.780\n but I do not think that we're ever going\n\n45:46.780 --> 45:50.300\n to wipe away causality at the macroscopic level.\n\n45:50.300 --> 45:52.340\n At the macroscopic, I mean, there's so many interesting\n\n45:52.340 --> 45:53.900\n things at the macroscopic level\n\n45:53.900 --> 45:56.680\n that may only exist at the macroscopic level.\n\n45:56.680 --> 45:59.200\n Like we already talked about consciousness\n\n45:59.200 --> 46:01.060\n that very well could be one of the things.\n\n46:01.060 --> 46:02.260\n You mentioned time travel.\n\n46:02.260 --> 46:07.260\n So, I mean, according to Einstein and in general,\n\n46:09.180 --> 46:11.680\n what types of travel do you think\n\n46:11.680 --> 46:14.020\n our physical universe allows?\n\n46:14.020 --> 46:17.060\n Well, it certainly allows time travel to the future.\n\n46:17.060 --> 46:18.660\n And I'm not talking about the silly thing\n\n46:18.660 --> 46:21.420\n that you and I are now going into the future\n\n46:21.420 --> 46:22.420\n second by second by second.\n\n46:22.420 --> 46:24.700\n I'm talking about really the diversion\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:27.460\n that you see in Hollywood, at least in terms\n\n46:27.460 --> 46:32.260\n of its net effect, whereby an individual\n\n46:32.260 --> 46:36.460\n can follow an Einsteinian strategy\n\n46:36.460 --> 46:40.660\n and propel themselves into the future\n\n46:40.660 --> 46:42.260\n in some sense more quickly.\n\n46:42.260 --> 46:46.020\n So if I wanted to see what's happening on planet Earth\n\n46:46.020 --> 46:50.100\n one million years from now, Einstein tells me\n\n46:50.100 --> 46:52.500\n how to get one million years from now.\n\n46:52.500 --> 46:53.340\n Build a ship.\n\n46:53.340 --> 46:56.380\n I got to turn to guys who know how to build stuff.\n\n46:56.380 --> 46:57.980\n I can't do it like you.\n\n46:57.980 --> 47:00.020\n Build a ship that can go out into the universe\n\n47:00.020 --> 47:02.780\n near the speed of light, turn around and come back.\n\n47:02.780 --> 47:04.420\n Let's say it's a six month journey out\n\n47:04.420 --> 47:05.900\n and a six month journey back.\n\n47:05.900 --> 47:09.420\n And Einstein tells me how fast I need to travel,\n\n47:09.420 --> 47:11.180\n how close to the speed of light I need to go\n\n47:11.180 --> 47:13.740\n so that when I step out of my ship,\n\n47:13.740 --> 47:16.980\n it will now be one million years into the future\n\n47:16.980 --> 47:20.140\n on planet Earth.\n\n47:20.140 --> 47:23.300\n And this is not a controversial statement, right?\n\n47:23.300 --> 47:25.940\n This is not something where there's differences\n\n47:25.940 --> 47:28.340\n of opinion in the scientific community.\n\n47:28.340 --> 47:30.900\n Any scientist who knows anything\n\n47:30.900 --> 47:35.100\n about what Einstein taught us agrees with what I just said.\n\n47:35.100 --> 47:37.740\n It's commonplace, it's bread and butter physics.\n\n47:37.740 --> 47:40.660\n And so that kind of travel to the future\n\n47:40.660 --> 47:44.140\n is absolutely allowed by the laws of physics.\n\n47:44.140 --> 47:45.820\n There are engineering challenges,\n\n47:45.820 --> 47:47.940\n there are technological challenges.\n\n47:47.940 --> 47:49.460\n They're close to the speed of light part, yeah.\n\n47:49.460 --> 47:52.780\n Yeah, and there are even biological challenges, right?\n\n47:52.780 --> 47:55.180\n They're G forces that you're gonna experience.\n\n47:55.180 --> 47:57.740\n So there's all sorts of stuff embedded in this,\n\n47:57.740 --> 48:01.020\n but those I will call the details.\n\n48:01.020 --> 48:04.380\n And those details, notwithstanding,\n\n48:04.380 --> 48:07.820\n the universe allows this kind of travel to the future.\n\n48:07.820 --> 48:09.660\n And if I could pause real quick,\n\n48:09.660 --> 48:12.620\n you could also, at the macro level,\n\n48:12.620 --> 48:15.360\n with biology extend the human lifespan\n\n48:15.360 --> 48:19.300\n to do a kind of travel forward in time.\n\n48:19.300 --> 48:22.540\n If you expand how long we live,\n\n48:22.540 --> 48:25.300\n that's a way to, from a perspective of an observer,\n\n48:25.300 --> 48:27.780\n a conscious observer that is a human being,\n\n48:27.780 --> 48:29.920\n you're essentially traveling forward in time\n\n48:29.920 --> 48:32.740\n by allowing yourself to live long enough to see the thing.\n\n48:32.740 --> 48:34.920\n So that's in the space of biology.\n\n48:34.920 --> 48:37.160\n What about traveling back in time?\n\n48:37.160 --> 48:41.980\n Yeah, that is a natural next question,\n\n48:41.980 --> 48:45.540\n especially if you're going on one of these journeys.\n\n48:45.540 --> 48:48.860\n Is it a one way journey or can you come back?\n\n48:48.860 --> 48:52.480\n And the physics community doesn't speak\n\n48:52.480 --> 48:55.220\n with a unified voice on this as yet,\n\n48:55.220 --> 48:57.860\n but I would say that the dominant perspective\n\n48:57.860 --> 49:00.260\n is that you cannot get back.\n\n49:00.260 --> 49:03.900\n Now, having said that, there are proposals\n\n49:03.900 --> 49:07.300\n that serious people have written papers on\n\n49:07.300 --> 49:09.080\n regarding hypothetical ways\n\n49:09.080 --> 49:10.900\n in which you could travel to the past.\n\n49:10.900 --> 49:13.500\n And we've seen some of these.\n\n49:13.500 --> 49:16.900\n Again, Hollywood loves to take the most sexy ideas\n\n49:16.900 --> 49:20.040\n of physics and build narratives around them.\n\n49:20.040 --> 49:21.980\n This idea of a wormhole,\n\n49:21.980 --> 49:25.480\n like Jodie Foster in Contact went through a wormhole,\n\n49:25.480 --> 49:26.500\n Deep Space Nine Star,\n\n49:26.500 --> 49:27.860\n I'm sure there are many other examples\n\n49:27.860 --> 49:30.480\n for these ideas that I've probably never even seen.\n\n49:30.480 --> 49:34.460\n But with wormholes, there's at least a proposal\n\n49:34.460 --> 49:38.200\n of how you could take a wormhole tunnel through space time,\n\n49:38.200 --> 49:40.520\n manipulate the openings of the wormhole\n\n49:40.520 --> 49:44.100\n in such a way that the openings are no longer synchronous.\n\n49:44.100 --> 49:46.300\n They are out of sync relative to each other,\n\n49:46.300 --> 49:48.980\n which would mean one's ahead and one's behind,\n\n49:48.980 --> 49:50.500\n which means if you go through one direction,\n\n49:50.500 --> 49:51.620\n you travel to the future.\n\n49:51.620 --> 49:54.380\n If you go back, you travel to the past.\n\n49:54.380 --> 49:57.740\n Now, we don't know if there are wormholes in the world.\n\n49:57.740 --> 49:59.820\n But they're possible according to Einstein, correct?\n\n49:59.820 --> 50:01.760\n They are possible according to Einstein.\n\n50:01.760 --> 50:04.420\n But even Einstein was very quick to say,\n\n50:04.420 --> 50:07.260\n just because my math allows for something,\n\n50:07.260 --> 50:08.100\n doesn't mean it's real.\n\n50:08.100 --> 50:10.860\n I mean, he famously didn't even believe in black holes.\n\n50:10.860 --> 50:12.900\n Didn't believe in the Big Bang, right?\n\n50:12.900 --> 50:17.180\n And yet the black hole issue has really been settled now.\n\n50:17.180 --> 50:20.740\n We have radio telescopic photographs\n\n50:20.740 --> 50:22.820\n of the black hole in M87.\n\n50:22.820 --> 50:25.240\n It was in newspapers around the world\n\n50:25.240 --> 50:26.360\n just a couple of years ago.\n\n50:26.360 --> 50:31.180\n So it's just to say that just because it's in Einstein's math,\n\n50:31.180 --> 50:32.180\n it doesn't mean it's real.\n\n50:32.180 --> 50:35.000\n But yes, it is the case that wormholes\n\n50:35.000 --> 50:36.680\n are allowed by Einstein's equations.\n\n50:36.680 --> 50:39.460\n And in principle, you can imagine, you know,\n\n50:39.460 --> 50:42.300\n putting electric charges on the openings of the wormhole,\n\n50:42.300 --> 50:44.380\n allowing you to tow them around\n\n50:44.380 --> 50:45.560\n in a manner that could yield\n\n50:45.560 --> 50:48.180\n this temporal asymmetry between them.\n\n50:48.180 --> 50:51.780\n Maybe you tow one of the mouths to the edge of a black hole.\n\n50:51.780 --> 50:53.380\n In principle, you can do this,\n\n50:53.380 --> 50:56.540\n slowing down the passage of time near that black hole.\n\n50:56.540 --> 50:58.140\n And then when you bring it back,\n\n50:58.140 --> 51:02.060\n it will be well out of sync with the other opening\n\n51:02.060 --> 51:05.420\n and therefore could be a significant temporal gap\n\n51:05.420 --> 51:07.100\n between one and the other.\n\n51:07.100 --> 51:10.840\n But people who study this in more detail question,\n\n51:10.840 --> 51:13.060\n could you ever keep a wormhole open,\n\n51:13.060 --> 51:14.760\n assuming it does exist?\n\n51:14.760 --> 51:17.420\n Could you ever travel through a wormhole\n\n51:17.420 --> 51:19.700\n or would there be a requirement\n\n51:19.700 --> 51:22.940\n to some kind of exotic matter to prop it open\n\n51:22.940 --> 51:24.420\n that perhaps doesn't exist?\n\n51:24.420 --> 51:28.060\n So there are many, many issues that people have raised.\n\n51:28.060 --> 51:31.060\n And I would say that the general sentiment\n\n51:31.060 --> 51:34.780\n is that it's unlikely that this kind of scenario\n\n51:34.780 --> 51:37.980\n is going to survive our deeper understanding of physics\n\n51:37.980 --> 51:39.220\n when we finally have it.\n\n51:39.220 --> 51:41.340\n But that doesn't mean that the door is closed.\n\n51:41.340 --> 51:44.800\n So maybe there's a small possibility\n\n51:44.800 --> 51:45.640\n that this could one day be real.\n\n51:45.640 --> 51:47.780\n That's such an interesting way to put it.\n\n51:47.780 --> 51:49.820\n It will not, this kind of scenario\n\n51:49.820 --> 51:53.500\n will not survive deep understanding of physics.\n\n51:53.500 --> 51:54.860\n It's an interesting way to put it\n\n51:54.860 --> 51:59.700\n because it makes you wonder what kind of scenarios\n\n51:59.700 --> 52:04.080\n will be created by our deeper understanding of physics.\n\n52:04.080 --> 52:08.340\n Maybe, sorry to go crazy for a second,\n\n52:08.340 --> 52:11.220\n but if you have like the pan psychism idea\n\n52:11.220 --> 52:14.200\n that consciousness permeates all matter,\n\n52:14.200 --> 52:17.980\n maybe traveling in that, whatever laws of physics,\n\n52:17.980 --> 52:20.140\n the consciousness operates under something like that.\n\n52:20.140 --> 52:21.740\n In that view of the university,\n\n52:21.740 --> 52:24.140\n if we somehow are able to understand that part,\n\n52:24.140 --> 52:26.420\n maybe traveling is super easy.\n\n52:26.420 --> 52:30.340\n Yeah, it does not follow the constraints\n\n52:30.340 --> 52:32.700\n of the speed of light, something like this.\n\n52:32.700 --> 52:37.700\n Yeah, so look, I have a definite degree of sympathy\n\n52:38.380 --> 52:42.980\n with the possibility that consciousness might be more\n\n52:42.980 --> 52:45.500\n than what we described earlier\n\n52:45.500 --> 52:48.180\n as just the byproduct of mindless particles.\n\n52:48.180 --> 52:50.500\n You just made the rock happy.\n\n52:50.500 --> 52:54.340\n Exactly, so it isn't the approach\n\n52:54.340 --> 52:59.340\n that feels to me the most likely, but I see the logic.\n\n52:59.580 --> 53:01.680\n If you've got the puzzle,\n\n53:01.680 --> 53:04.280\n how to mindless particles build mind,\n\n53:04.280 --> 53:08.320\n one resolution might be the particles are not mindless.\n\n53:08.320 --> 53:10.960\n The particles have some kind of proto conscious quality.\n\n53:10.960 --> 53:13.020\n So there's something appealing\n\n53:13.020 --> 53:16.180\n about that straightforward solution to the puzzle.\n\n53:16.180 --> 53:20.140\n And if that's the case, if we do live in a pan psychist world\n\n53:20.140 --> 53:22.980\n where there is a degree of consciousness residing\n\n53:22.980 --> 53:25.220\n in everything in the world around us, then yes,\n\n53:25.220 --> 53:28.820\n I do think some interesting possibilities might emerge\n\n53:28.820 --> 53:31.720\n where maybe there's a way of communing\n\n53:31.720 --> 53:36.720\n with physical reality in a deeper way than we have so far.\n\n53:36.940 --> 53:38.660\n I mean, we as human beings,\n\n53:38.660 --> 53:40.580\n a vital part of our existence\n\n53:40.580 --> 53:43.860\n is human to human communication, contact.\n\n53:43.860 --> 53:46.540\n We live in social groups and that's what it's allowed us\n\n53:46.540 --> 53:48.820\n to get to the place where we've gotten.\n\n53:48.820 --> 53:51.700\n Imagine that we have long missed\n\n53:51.700 --> 53:54.700\n that there's other consciousness out there\n\n53:54.700 --> 53:57.520\n and some kind of relationship or communion\n\n53:57.520 --> 53:59.980\n with that larger conscious possibility\n\n53:59.980 --> 54:01.380\n would take us to a different place.\n\n54:01.380 --> 54:03.860\n Now, do I buy into this yet?\n\n54:03.860 --> 54:06.420\n I don't, I don't see any evidence for it,\n\n54:06.420 --> 54:10.460\n but do I have an open mind and allow for the possibility\n\n54:10.460 --> 54:11.420\n in the future?\n\n54:11.420 --> 54:12.320\n Yeah, I do.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:15.380\n So if that's not the case\n\n54:15.380 --> 54:18.420\n and you have these simple particles\n\n54:18.420 --> 54:21.880\n that at the macro level emerges some interesting stuff\n\n54:21.880 --> 54:24.900\n like consciousness, another thing you write about\n\n54:24.900 --> 54:27.280\n in the Until the End of Time book\n\n54:27.280 --> 54:30.860\n is the thing that it seems to emerge at the macro level\n\n54:30.860 --> 54:34.960\n is the feeling like there's a free will,\n\n54:34.960 --> 54:36.380\n like we decide to do stuff.\n\n54:36.380 --> 54:39.100\n And you have a really interesting take here,\n\n54:39.100 --> 54:43.500\n which is, no, there's not a free will.\n\n54:43.500 --> 54:45.900\n I'm just gonna speak for you and then you can correct me.\n\n54:45.900 --> 54:48.080\n No, there's not a free will,\n\n54:48.080 --> 54:51.420\n but there is an experience of freedom.\n\n54:51.420 --> 54:52.260\n Yeah.\n\n54:54.260 --> 54:56.100\n Which I really love.\n\n54:56.100 --> 54:58.400\n So where does the experience,\n\n54:58.400 --> 54:59.780\n where does freedom come from\n\n54:59.780 --> 55:02.700\n if we don't have any kind of physics based free will?\n\n55:02.700 --> 55:06.820\n Yeah, and so the idea follows naturally\n\n55:06.820 --> 55:08.480\n from all that we've been talking about.\n\n55:08.480 --> 55:11.860\n Let's make the assumption that all there is\n\n55:11.860 --> 55:15.380\n in the physical universe is stuff governed by laws.\n\n55:15.380 --> 55:16.520\n We may not have those laws,\n\n55:16.520 --> 55:19.500\n may not know what the fundamental stuff is yet,\n\n55:19.500 --> 55:23.700\n but everything we know in science points in the direction\n\n55:23.700 --> 55:27.860\n that it's physical stuff governed by universal laws.\n\n55:27.860 --> 55:31.380\n And that being the case, or that being the assumption,\n\n55:31.380 --> 55:33.880\n then you come to a particular collection\n\n55:33.880 --> 55:35.900\n of those ingredients called a human being.\n\n55:35.900 --> 55:38.120\n And that human being has particles\n\n55:38.120 --> 55:41.620\n that are fully governed by physical law.\n\n55:41.620 --> 55:43.100\n And when you then recognize it,\n\n55:43.100 --> 55:44.380\n every thought that we have,\n\n55:44.380 --> 55:46.500\n every action that we undertake\n\n55:46.500 --> 55:49.400\n is just the motion of particles.\n\n55:49.400 --> 55:50.900\n When I'm thinking thoughts right now,\n\n55:50.900 --> 55:53.840\n of course, at this level of description,\n\n55:53.840 --> 55:56.320\n it is the motion of particles cascading\n\n55:56.320 --> 55:59.820\n down various neurons inside of my head and so on.\n\n55:59.820 --> 56:02.780\n And every single one of those motions,\n\n56:02.780 --> 56:05.340\n collectively and individually,\n\n56:05.340 --> 56:08.540\n is fully governed by these laws\n\n56:08.540 --> 56:09.900\n that we perhaps don't have yet,\n\n56:09.900 --> 56:12.060\n but we imagine one day we will.\n\n56:12.060 --> 56:15.780\n That leaves no opportunity for any kind of freedom\n\n56:15.780 --> 56:19.580\n to break free from the constraint of physical law.\n\n56:19.580 --> 56:21.660\n And that is the end of the story.\n\n56:21.660 --> 56:24.480\n So the traditional intuitive notion of free will,\n\n56:24.480 --> 56:26.880\n that we're the ultimate authors of our actions,\n\n56:26.880 --> 56:28.300\n that we were the buck stops,\n\n56:28.300 --> 56:30.260\n that there is no antecedent,\n\n56:30.260 --> 56:35.000\n that is the cause for our decided to go left or right,\n\n56:35.000 --> 56:38.180\n choose vanilla or chocolate, live or die,\n\n56:38.180 --> 56:42.060\n that intuitive sensation does not have a basis\n\n56:42.060 --> 56:43.780\n in our understanding of the physical world.\n\n56:43.780 --> 56:47.140\n So that's the end of the free will of the traditional sort.\n\n56:47.140 --> 56:49.100\n But then your question is,\n\n56:49.100 --> 56:52.020\n what about this other kind of freedom I talk about?\n\n56:52.020 --> 56:53.900\n And the other kind of freedom,\n\n56:53.900 --> 56:55.860\n if you focus on it intently,\n\n56:55.860 --> 57:00.700\n I think is actually the true version of freedom\n\n57:00.700 --> 57:02.180\n that we feel.\n\n57:02.180 --> 57:04.300\n And that freedom is this.\n\n57:04.300 --> 57:07.020\n You look at inanimate objects in the world,\n\n57:07.020 --> 57:10.140\n rocks, bottles of water, whatever,\n\n57:10.140 --> 57:13.340\n they have a very limited behavioral repertoire.\n\n57:13.340 --> 57:14.180\n Why?\n\n57:14.180 --> 57:17.100\n Their internal organization is too coarse\n\n57:17.100 --> 57:18.880\n for them to do very much, right?\n\n57:18.880 --> 57:22.040\n You try to have a conversation with a glass of water,\n\n57:22.040 --> 57:24.800\n you send sound waves, it doesn't do much.\n\n57:24.800 --> 57:26.140\n It may vibrate a little bit,\n\n57:26.140 --> 57:30.200\n but the repertoire of responses are incredibly limited.\n\n57:30.200 --> 57:33.060\n The difference between us and a rock or a bottle of water\n\n57:33.060 --> 57:35.100\n is that our inner organization,\n\n57:35.100 --> 57:38.420\n by virtue of eons of evolution by natural selection,\n\n57:38.420 --> 57:42.720\n is so refined, so spectacularly ordered,\n\n57:42.720 --> 57:46.460\n that we have a huge repertoire of behaviors\n\n57:46.460 --> 57:51.460\n that are finely attuned to stimuli from the external world.\n\n57:51.460 --> 57:53.320\n You ask me a question, that's a stimulus,\n\n57:53.320 --> 57:54.460\n and all of a sudden,\n\n57:54.460 --> 57:56.860\n these particle processes go into action,\n\n57:56.860 --> 58:00.080\n and this is the result, this answer that I'm giving you.\n\n58:00.080 --> 58:03.760\n So the freedom that we have is not from\n\n58:03.760 --> 58:05.580\n the control of physical law.\n\n58:05.580 --> 58:08.260\n The freedom that we have is from the constrained behavior\n\n58:08.260 --> 58:11.380\n that has long since governed inanimate objects.\n\n58:11.380 --> 58:14.700\n We are liberated from the limited behavioral repertoire\n\n58:14.700 --> 58:17.220\n of rocks and bottles of water\n\n58:17.220 --> 58:20.100\n to have this broad spectrum of responses.\n\n58:20.100 --> 58:20.940\n Do we pick them?\n\n58:20.940 --> 58:21.840\n We do not.\n\n58:21.840 --> 58:23.060\n Do we freely choose them?\n\n58:23.060 --> 58:26.060\n We do not, but yet we have them,\n\n58:26.060 --> 58:29.340\n and we can marvel at those behaviors,\n\n58:29.340 --> 58:31.460\n and that's the freedom that we have.\n\n58:31.460 --> 58:34.300\n The complexity and the breadth of that repertoire\n\n58:34.300 --> 58:36.700\n is where the freedom emerges.\n\n58:36.700 --> 58:40.260\n Is there something to be said about emergence?\n\n58:40.260 --> 58:42.060\n I don't know if you know,\n\n58:42.060 --> 58:43.700\n I've looked at much about objects\n\n58:43.700 --> 58:47.280\n that I seem to love way more than anyone else,\n\n58:47.280 --> 58:48.500\n which is Sally or Tom,\n\n58:49.420 --> 58:51.700\n like game of life type of stuff.\n\n58:51.700 --> 58:56.700\n From simple things emerges beautiful complexities,\n\n58:56.740 --> 58:58.980\n and so that's that repertoire.\n\n58:58.980 --> 59:03.980\n It's like, it seems if you have enough stuff,\n\n59:04.060 --> 59:06.300\n just beautiful complexity emerges\n\n59:06.300 --> 59:09.620\n that sure as heck to our human eyes looks\n\n59:09.620 --> 59:12.060\n like there's consciousness there, there's free will,\n\n59:12.060 --> 59:15.640\n there's little objects moving about and making decisions.\n\n59:15.640 --> 59:16.820\n I mean, all of that,\n\n59:16.820 --> 59:18.920\n you can say it's anthropomorphization,\n\n59:18.920 --> 59:21.820\n but it sure as heck feels\n\n59:21.820 --> 59:24.580\n like they're organisms making decisions.\n\n59:25.580 --> 59:27.660\n What is that emergence thing?\n\n59:27.660 --> 59:31.220\n Is that within the realm of physics to understand?\n\n59:31.220 --> 59:35.060\n Is it within the realm of poetry?\n\n59:36.100 --> 59:39.620\n What is that, like complex systems, emergence?\n\n59:39.620 --> 59:41.580\n Will that ever be understood by science?\n\n59:41.580 --> 59:43.980\n So here's the way that I think about it.\n\n59:43.980 --> 59:47.820\n So there are clearly qualities of the world\n\n59:47.820 --> 59:50.980\n that emerge on macroscopic scales,\n\n59:50.980 --> 59:53.740\n our sense of beauty, wonder, consciousness,\n\n59:53.740 --> 59:55.900\n all of these kinds of qualities.\n\n59:55.900 --> 1:00:00.180\n Do I feel that they ultimately are explainable\n\n1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:01.180\n from the laws of physics?\n\n1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:02.540\n I do.\n\n1:00:02.540 --> 1:00:06.300\n There is nothing that's not ultimately explainable\n\n1:00:06.300 --> 1:00:09.460\n with the laws of physics from this physicalist perspective,\n\n1:00:09.460 --> 1:00:10.880\n which is what I take.\n\n1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:13.980\n So you got the particles, you got the laws,\n\n1:00:13.980 --> 1:00:16.180\n and you have things that emerge\n\n1:00:16.180 --> 1:00:20.780\n from the choreographed motions of those particles.\n\n1:00:20.780 --> 1:00:23.060\n But is that the best language\n\n1:00:23.060 --> 1:00:26.100\n for talking about these emergent qualities?\n\n1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:27.540\n Usually not.\n\n1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:30.940\n If I was to take something even more mundane,\n\n1:00:30.940 --> 1:00:33.180\n like a baseball flying through the air,\n\n1:00:33.180 --> 1:00:35.680\n if I was to describe it in terms of the quarks\n\n1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:36.820\n and the electrons,\n\n1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:39.020\n I'd give you this mountain of data\n\n1:00:39.020 --> 1:00:42.340\n with 10 to the 28 particles\n\n1:00:42.340 --> 1:00:45.300\n and all of their coordinates and spaces\n\n1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:46.120\n a function of time.\n\n1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:46.960\n I hand you this mountain of data,\n\n1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:49.180\n you'd be like, I don't know what this is.\n\n1:00:49.180 --> 1:00:51.180\n And then if you really were clever and you're looking,\n\n1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:53.240\n oh, it's a baseball,\n\n1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:57.060\n just described in the least economical way possible.\n\n1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:00.240\n It is much more useful and insightful\n\n1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:01.940\n to talk about the baseball flying through the air.\n\n1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:05.660\n Similarly, there are things at the macroscopic level\n\n1:01:05.660 --> 1:01:09.680\n like human experience and human emotion and human action\n\n1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:12.660\n and the sensation of free will\n\n1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:14.780\n that we undeniably all have,\n\n1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:17.420\n even if it itself doesn't have a basis\n\n1:01:17.420 --> 1:01:19.460\n in our understanding of the physical world.\n\n1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:24.380\n It's useful to talk about things in this very human language.\n\n1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:26.700\n And so, yes, it's vital to talk about things\n\n1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:29.360\n in the poetic language of human experience,\n\n1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.820\n but do not lose sight of the fact, and some people do.\n\n1:01:31.820 --> 1:01:33.880\n They say, oh, it's just an emergent phenomenon.\n\n1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.100\n Don't lose sight of the fact that emergent phenomena\n\n1:01:36.100 --> 1:01:39.840\n are emerging from this deeper understanding\n\n1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:42.820\n that comes from the reductionist account of physical law.\n\n1:01:42.820 --> 1:01:44.840\n And there's a lot of insight to come from that,\n\n1:01:44.840 --> 1:01:48.580\n such as the freedom that you thought that you had,\n\n1:01:48.580 --> 1:01:50.340\n the freedom of will that you thought you had.\n\n1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:53.180\n It doesn't have a basis in that reductionist account,\n\n1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:54.280\n so it's not real.\n\n1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:59.060\n So speaking of the poetry of human experience,\n\n1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:01.140\n you mentioned the images of the black holes.\n\n1:02:01.140 --> 1:02:03.140\n How did it make you feel a few years ago\n\n1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:04.820\n when that first image came out?\n\n1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:06.300\n It's truly amazing.\n\n1:02:06.300 --> 1:02:11.300\n A sense of, well, I guess the feeling was both amazing\n\n1:02:11.860 --> 1:02:13.780\n and there was a little sense of,\n\n1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:17.340\n jealousy is not quite the right word,\n\n1:02:17.340 --> 1:02:19.540\n but a sense of longing.\n\n1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:20.920\n Yeah, I think that's a better word,\n\n1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:25.480\n because here's a subject that started with Einstein\n\n1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:28.520\n back in 1915, writes down the equations\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.620\n of the general theory of relativity,\n\n1:02:30.620 --> 1:02:34.820\n and then there are scores of individuals over the decades,\n\n1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:37.500\n starting with people like Karl Schwarzschild\n\n1:02:37.500 --> 1:02:38.900\n who analyze the equations,\n\n1:02:38.900 --> 1:02:40.340\n see the possibility of black holes.\n\n1:02:40.340 --> 1:02:41.620\n People develop these ideas.\n\n1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:44.140\n John Wheeler, all these greats of physics.\n\n1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:46.460\n It's still a hypothetical subject.\n\n1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:48.940\n It gets closer to reality through observations\n\n1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:50.500\n of the center of our galaxy,\n\n1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.400\n stars whipping around in a manner\n\n1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:54.620\n that could only really be explained\n\n1:02:54.620 --> 1:02:56.940\n by there being a black hole in the center of our galaxy,\n\n1:02:56.940 --> 1:02:58.780\n but it was still indirect.\n\n1:02:58.780 --> 1:03:03.580\n To actually have a direct image that you can look at,\n\n1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:06.180\n what a beautiful arc, narrative arc\n\n1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:10.180\n from the theoretical to the absolutely established.\n\n1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:13.620\n And that's what we hope will happen with other areas,\n\n1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:15.140\n for instance, string theory, right?\n\n1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:18.620\n I mean, wholly mathematical subject at the outset\n\n1:03:18.620 --> 1:03:22.580\n and still pretty much a wholly mathematical subject today.\n\n1:03:22.580 --> 1:03:25.900\n Yeah, do we long for that image\n\n1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:29.500\n where we can look at it and say, string, it's real.\n\n1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:33.600\n I mean, how thrilling, how thrilling to be part\n\n1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:36.420\n of that journey, to be part of that step\n\n1:03:36.420 --> 1:03:39.040\n that moves things from the abstract to the concrete.\n\n1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:44.040\n Yeah, so like the image of the DNA, the early images\n\n1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:47.520\n of the DNA, for example, but there is something special.\n\n1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:50.940\n So the problem with strings is they're tiny.\n\n1:03:50.940 --> 1:03:54.900\n So it's harder to take a picture in the following sense.\n\n1:03:54.900 --> 1:03:58.000\n When you think of a black hole, I mean, you have a swirl\n\n1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.960\n of, I guess, what is, I don't even know it's dust,\n\n1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.400\n whatever light.\n\n1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:04.560\n A careening onto the event horizon.\n\n1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:06.680\n And then there's darkness in the center.\n\n1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.120\n And you just imagine, so that picture in particular,\n\n1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:13.000\n I guess, is of a gigantic black hole.\n\n1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.160\n So you just, I mean, it's terrifying.\n\n1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:17.600\n Billions of times the mass of the sun.\n\n1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:19.880\n Yeah, so it's both exciting and terrifying.\n\n1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:22.040\n I mean, I don't know where you fall in the spectrum.\n\n1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:24.920\n I think it's exciting at first.\n\n1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:27.040\n Like the longer I think about it, every time I think\n\n1:04:27.040 --> 1:04:29.280\n about it, the more terrifying it becomes.\n\n1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:32.760\n So it always starts exciting and then it goes to terrifying.\n\n1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:36.160\n And both are feelings, very human feelings\n\n1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:38.360\n that I appreciate.\n\n1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.600\n It's like terrified awe.\n\n1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:43.080\n Somehow it's still beautiful.\n\n1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:43.920\n It's a good way of saying it.\n\n1:04:43.920 --> 1:04:45.960\n And I think I kind of share that reaction\n\n1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:49.040\n because there is a way in which when you work on this\n\n1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:52.880\n subject, like all the time, I teach it, I teach about\n\n1:04:52.880 --> 1:04:55.540\n black holes, write the equations on the blackboard.\n\n1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:01.800\n The ideas reside in a very cognitive,\n\n1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:06.440\n I don't know, mathematical portion of the brain,\n\n1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:08.280\n or at least for me.\n\n1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:11.920\n And it's only when you like sit down and it's quiet\n\n1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:13.680\n and you start to contemplate, wait, wait, wait, wait,\n\n1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:16.240\n this isn't just like a mathematical game.\n\n1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:19.400\n There are these monsters out there.\n\n1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:22.760\n Now I don't, not in a sense of I fear for my life,\n\n1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:27.760\n but it's a sense of how extraordinary is this universe.\n\n1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:30.440\n And so it is breathtaking.\n\n1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:31.960\n How powerful nature is.\n\n1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:36.960\n Yeah, how stupendously powerful nature is.\n\n1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:42.120\n And so there is a deep sense of humility\n\n1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:45.200\n that I think this instills if you really allow\n\n1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:46.680\n the ideas to sink in.\n\n1:05:48.260 --> 1:05:51.440\n Well, I have to ask about the most stupendously\n\n1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:54.360\n powerful thing to have ever happened in our universe,\n\n1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:55.540\n which is the Big Bang.\n\n1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:57.880\n What's up with the Big Bang?\n\n1:05:57.880 --> 1:06:01.360\n So we can, I mean, with gravitational waves,\n\n1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:05.040\n the hope is you have more and more accurate measurements\n\n1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:06.040\n of the gravitational waves.\n\n1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:08.440\n You can crawl back further and further back in time\n\n1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:09.600\n towards the Big Bang.\n\n1:06:10.680 --> 1:06:13.440\n Do you have a hope that we'll be able to understand\n\n1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:18.080\n the early spark that created our universe?\n\n1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:23.080\n Yeah, that and the deep interior of a black hole\n\n1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.960\n I think are the biggest mysteries that we hope\n\n1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.720\n the melding of quantum mechanics and gravity will reveal,\n\n1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:32.440\n will illuminate.\n\n1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:36.960\n And what question could be more captivating\n\n1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:39.920\n than why is there something rather than nothing, right?\n\n1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:43.240\n Why is there a universe at all?\n\n1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:46.360\n And will the theories that we're developing\n\n1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:48.480\n take us to an answer to that?\n\n1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:49.720\n I don't know.\n\n1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.680\n Even if we truly knew what the Big Bang is,\n\n1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:53.480\n and that's a big question in its own right,\n\n1:06:53.480 --> 1:06:55.120\n one would still be left with the question,\n\n1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:59.080\n well, okay, so you've explained the process\n\n1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:03.560\n by which a tiny nugget of a universe,\n\n1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:08.160\n a tiny nugget of space time can undergo some kind of growth\n\n1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:10.080\n to yield the world around us.\n\n1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:12.920\n But presumably in that explanation,\n\n1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.400\n you're gonna involve mathematics and some ingredients\n\n1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:21.400\n like quantum fields or matter or energy or something.\n\n1:07:21.880 --> 1:07:24.680\n Where did that stuff come from?\n\n1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:26.880\n Can we get to that level of explanation?\n\n1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:29.120\n I don't know, but it is remarkable\n\n1:07:29.120 --> 1:07:34.120\n that if you ask what happened a millionth of a second\n\n1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:36.040\n after the Big Bang,\n\n1:07:36.040 --> 1:07:40.240\n it's not really that controversial any longer, right?\n\n1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:42.760\n Even though there's a lot of argument in the field\n\n1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:45.400\n and it's very heated right now I should say\n\n1:07:45.400 --> 1:07:49.920\n regarding what is the right theory of the Big Bang?\n\n1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:53.440\n What is the right theory of early universe cosmology\n\n1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:55.000\n where I mean early, much earlier\n\n1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.040\n than a millionth of a second,\n\n1:07:56.040 --> 1:08:01.040\n a lot of dissent, a lot of heated arguments about that.\n\n1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:02.680\n No pun intended.\n\n1:08:02.680 --> 1:08:04.280\n Yeah, right, exactly.\n\n1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:08.160\n But you go like a millionth of a second after that\n\n1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:10.080\n and we're on pretty firm ground.\n\n1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:12.160\n Isn't that amazing, right?\n\n1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:15.400\n To understand what happened from that point forward.\n\n1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:18.240\n But to go back is controversial.\n\n1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:21.600\n So there is this theory called inflationary cosmology,\n\n1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:24.560\n which I would say has been the dominant paradigm\n\n1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:27.120\n since early 1980s.\n\n1:08:27.120 --> 1:08:27.960\n So what does that mean?\n\n1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:28.920\n Roughly 40 years now,\n\n1:08:28.920 --> 1:08:31.400\n it's been the dominant cosmological paradigm.\n\n1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:33.760\n And it makes use of a curious feature\n\n1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.000\n of Einstein's general theory of relativity,\n\n1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:37.240\n his theory of gravity,\n\n1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:39.800\n where Einstein shows us mathematically\n\n1:08:39.800 --> 1:08:41.840\n that gravity can not only be attractive,\n\n1:08:41.840 --> 1:08:43.280\n the kind of gravity that we're used to,\n\n1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.400\n things pulled together, but it can also be repulsive.\n\n1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:52.400\n And that fact is then leveraged by people like Alan Guth\n\n1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:56.240\n and Andre Linde, and at the time Paul Steinhardt\n\n1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:58.760\n and Andreas Albrecht and others to say,\n\n1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:01.400\n okay, if we had a little nugget in the earlier universe,\n\n1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:03.520\n which was filled with the stuff\n\n1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:05.520\n that yields this repulsive gravity,\n\n1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:07.360\n well, that would have blown everything apart.\n\n1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.160\n It would cause everything to swell.\n\n1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:11.400\n Beautiful explanation for what the bang\n\n1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:13.040\n in the big bang was.\n\n1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.760\n And then people mathematically analyze the consequences\n\n1:09:16.760 --> 1:09:19.040\n of this idea and they make predictions\n\n1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.680\n for tiny temperature differences across the night sky\n\n1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:24.840\n that in principle could be measured.\n\n1:09:24.840 --> 1:09:27.120\n You send up balloons, you send up satellites\n\n1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:29.920\n with very refined thermometers,\n\n1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.000\n and they measured the temperature of the night sky\n\n1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:34.800\n and the statistical distribution\n\n1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:36.440\n of the temperature differences agrees\n\n1:09:36.440 --> 1:09:38.280\n with the mathematical predictions.\n\n1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:43.200\n I mean, you just sort of have to stand in awe\n\n1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:44.560\n of this insight.\n\n1:09:44.560 --> 1:09:48.320\n So you think, aha, the theory has been established,\n\n1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.320\n but scientists are an incredibly skeptical bunch.\n\n1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:56.640\n And some scientists, including one of the people\n\n1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.360\n who helped develop the theory at the outset,\n\n1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.960\n Paul Steinhardt comes along and says,\n\n1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:04.120\n well, yeah, this theory has done pretty well so far,\n\n1:10:04.120 --> 1:10:06.480\n but there are aspects of this theory\n\n1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:08.160\n that are making me lose confidence.\n\n1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:10.880\n For instance, this theory seems to suggest\n\n1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:13.360\n that there might be other universes.\n\n1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:15.280\n Like, how do you make sense of a theory\n\n1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:16.880\n that suggests there are other universes?\n\n1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.920\n Or there are others who come along and say,\n\n1:10:18.920 --> 1:10:23.240\n this theory seems to talk about length scales\n\n1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:26.680\n that are minuscule even by the so called Planck length,\n\n1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:29.360\n the sort of shortest length that we can imagine\n\n1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.840\n making sense of in a theory of quantum gravity.\n\n1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:33.440\n How do you make sense of that?\n\n1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:36.720\n And so on and so forth, they develop a list of things\n\n1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:38.560\n that they consider to be chinks\n\n1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:42.600\n in the inflationary cosmological theory's armor.\n\n1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.120\n And they develop other ideas,\n\n1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:47.560\n which they claim yield the same predictions\n\n1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:48.640\n as inflationary cosmology\n\n1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.440\n for those temperature differences across space,\n\n1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:52.840\n but don't suffer from these problems.\n\n1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:55.160\n And then the inflationary cosmology folks say,\n\n1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:56.720\n no, no, no, hang on.\n\n1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:59.920\n Your theory suffers from different problems.\n\n1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:02.600\n And so the arguments goes, it's a healthy debate.\n\n1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:05.120\n Talk about real debates in science.\n\n1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:07.800\n So when you ask what's up with the Big Bang,\n\n1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.920\n I don't know right now.\n\n1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:12.760\n If you would have asked me five years ago,\n\n1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:15.160\n maybe even less than that, three or four years ago,\n\n1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:19.080\n I've said, look, inflationary cosmology has some issues,\n\n1:11:19.080 --> 1:11:23.560\n but the package of explanations it provides is so potent\n\n1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.560\n and the issues that beset it are seemingly solvable to me\n\n1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:32.920\n that I would imagine it's going to in the end, win out.\n\n1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:34.200\n I would still say that today,\n\n1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:36.200\n but I wouldn't say it as loudly.\n\n1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.800\n I wouldn't say it as confidently.\n\n1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.120\n I think it's worth thinking about alternate ideas\n\n1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.280\n and it could be the case that the paradigm\n\n1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:45.680\n at some point shifts.\n\n1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:50.480\n Does dark matter and dark energy fit into the shifting\n\n1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:52.520\n of the explanations for those?\n\n1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:53.360\n Yeah, certainly.\n\n1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:58.360\n So dark energy has in the inflationary theory\n\n1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:00.200\n is kind of a big mystery.\n\n1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:05.200\n So dark energy is the observational realization\n\n1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:06.800\n in the last 20 years\n\n1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:09.440\n that not only is the universe expanding,\n\n1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:11.520\n it's expanding ever more quickly.\n\n1:12:11.520 --> 1:12:15.080\n Something is still pushing things outward.\n\n1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.320\n And the explanation is that there's like a residual version\n\n1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:20.560\n of the repulsive gravity from the early universe,\n\n1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:23.000\n but it's such a strange number.\n\n1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.600\n When you write that amount of dark energy\n\n1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:29.080\n using the relevant units in a theory of quantum gravity,\n\n1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:33.040\n it's a decimal point followed by like 120 zeros\n\n1:12:33.040 --> 1:12:34.640\n and then a one.\n\n1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:38.280\n We're not used to those kinds of numbers in physics.\n\n1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:43.280\n We're used to a half, one, pi, e squared to two.\n\n1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.720\n Those are the kinds of fundamental numbers\n\n1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:49.840\n that emerge in our explanations of the world.\n\n1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:51.920\n And we look at this bizarre number,\n\n1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:53.720\n decimal point, all these zeros and a one,\n\n1:12:53.720 --> 1:12:56.200\n we say something's wrong there.\n\n1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:59.600\n Like where would that number have come from?\n\n1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:01.800\n And now there are people who suggest resolution to it.\n\n1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.600\n So it's not like we're totally in the dark on it,\n\n1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:06.680\n but those people like Paul Steinhard\n\n1:13:06.680 --> 1:13:09.120\n who have alternate cosmological theories,\n\n1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.160\n cyclic cosmologies as they call it,\n\n1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:14.480\n claim that they have a more natural explanation\n\n1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.880\n of the dark energy,\n\n1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:19.360\n that it naturally feeds into a cyclical process\n\n1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:22.760\n that is their cosmological paradigm.\n\n1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.240\n So yeah, if the cosmology should change,\n\n1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:29.200\n it's conceivable our view of dark energy\n\n1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:31.480\n may change from deeply mysterious\n\n1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:34.240\n to deeply integrated into a different paradigm.\n\n1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:35.560\n That is possible.\n\n1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:37.440\n I think it's Roger Penrose that think\n\n1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:39.480\n that information can bleed through\n\n1:13:39.480 --> 1:13:42.440\n from before the Big Bang to the after the Big Bang.\n\n1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:46.880\n Is the Big Bang like a full erasure of the hard drive\n\n1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:48.920\n or is there some information that could bleed through?\n\n1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:53.920\n Yeah, I mean, so Roger is among the most creative thinkers\n\n1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:55.760\n of the last 100 years,\n\n1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.280\n rightly won the Nobel Prize for his insights\n\n1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:02.000\n into singularities in space time\n\n1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:06.480\n that we know to afflict our mathematical solutions\n\n1:14:06.480 --> 1:14:08.120\n of black holes in the Big Bang and so forth.\n\n1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:13.120\n And he has an enormously fertile imagination.\n\n1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:16.320\n And I mean that in the most positive sense.\n\n1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:19.640\n And so he has put forward this idea,\n\n1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:21.880\n this conformal cyclic cosmology,\n\n1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.760\n I think is the official title,\n\n1:14:23.760 --> 1:14:26.280\n although I could be getting that wrong.\n\n1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:27.920\n I can't say that I've studied it.\n\n1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:30.280\n I have seen lectures on it.\n\n1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:33.240\n I don't find it convincing as yet.\n\n1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:38.240\n It feels like it's being built to find a solution\n\n1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:42.200\n as opposed to sort of more naturally emerging.\n\n1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:43.920\n Maybe Roger would say otherwise.\n\n1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:45.720\n And I don't mean to in any way\n\n1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:48.440\n cast aspersions on the work.\n\n1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:51.400\n It's vital and interesting and people are thinking about it.\n\n1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:55.400\n I don't consider it as close a competitor\n\n1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:58.080\n to say the inflationary theory as for instance,\n\n1:14:58.080 --> 1:15:00.840\n the stuff that Paul Steinhardt has put forward.\n\n1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:04.120\n But again, you've got to keep an open mind\n\n1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.320\n in this business when there's so much\n\n1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:07.680\n that we don't yet understand.\n\n1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:08.800\n I mean, it is wild to think\n\n1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:10.880\n that information could survive something like that.\n\n1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:13.320\n Just like it is wild to imagine\n\n1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:16.560\n that information could escape a black hole, for example.\n\n1:15:16.560 --> 1:15:20.160\n It just seems like by construction,\n\n1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.160\n these things are supposed to not bleed out anything.\n\n1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:25.840\n But one of the challenges in all of these theories\n\n1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:27.640\n is when we talk about a singularity,\n\n1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:30.200\n has this real sexy term, the singularity.\n\n1:15:30.200 --> 1:15:33.560\n But a singularity is in more ordinary language,\n\n1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:39.760\n a physical system where the mathematics breaks down.\n\n1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:41.080\n It's nonsensical.\n\n1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:42.800\n It's like taking one divided by zero.\n\n1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:45.640\n You put that into a calculator and it says E error, right?\n\n1:15:45.640 --> 1:15:48.240\n It does not make sense, doesn't compute.\n\n1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:53.240\n And so it's very hard to make definitive statements\n\n1:15:53.240 --> 1:15:56.160\n about things like the Big Bang or about black holes\n\n1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:59.840\n until we cure the mathematical singularities.\n\n1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:03.160\n And there are some who claim that in certain regimes,\n\n1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:05.800\n the singularities have been cured.\n\n1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.560\n I don't by any means think that there's consensus\n\n1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:09.560\n on these ideas.\n\n1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:12.560\n So when one talks about information sort of bleeding\n\n1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:15.000\n through the Big Bang, you've really got to make sure\n\n1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.840\n that the equations have no singularity.\n\n1:16:16.840 --> 1:16:18.240\n You talk about cyclic cosmology,\n\n1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.040\n you've got to make sure that the equations\n\n1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:22.080\n don't have any singularities as you go from, say,\n\n1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:23.680\n one cycle to the next.\n\n1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:25.640\n Now, some of the proponents of these theories claim\n\n1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:27.520\n that they have resolved these issues.\n\n1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:30.160\n I don't think that there's a general sense\n\n1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:32.920\n that that is the case as yet, but it could be that,\n\n1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:36.360\n look, life is so short that I haven't had the time\n\n1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:39.000\n to deeply delve into all the mathematical intricacies\n\n1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:40.760\n of all the ideas that have been put forward.\n\n1:16:40.760 --> 1:16:42.720\n If I did that, I'd never do anything else.\n\n1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:44.200\n But that's what the issue is.\n\n1:16:44.200 --> 1:16:45.880\n And of course, it's just math.\n\n1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:47.240\n There may be holes.\n\n1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:52.240\n There may be gaps in our understanding\n\n1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:55.160\n in the way we're modeling physical reality.\n\n1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:56.000\n Well, that's the point.\n\n1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.480\n In fact, when you said, I was about to jump in\n\n1:16:57.480 --> 1:16:59.360\n and say modeling, but you got there first,\n\n1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:01.080\n and it's exactly the right point.\n\n1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.640\n We're talking about the universe here, right?\n\n1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:06.960\n And how do you talk about the universe\n\n1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:09.000\n with a straight face, mathematically?\n\n1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:12.080\n And the way you do it is you simplify,\n\n1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:14.680\n you throw away those characteristics of the universe\n\n1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:18.520\n that you don't think are vital to a full understanding.\n\n1:17:18.520 --> 1:17:21.560\n And so we're gonna get to a point people are starting to\n\n1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:24.800\n where we've got to go beyond those simplifications.\n\n1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:29.360\n And so cosmology has for a long time modeled the universe\n\n1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:33.320\n in the most simplest terms, homogeneous, isotropic.\n\n1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:35.920\n It has just a few parameters that describe it,\n\n1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:38.560\n the average density of mass and energy and so forth.\n\n1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:40.360\n We have to go beyond those simplifications,\n\n1:17:40.360 --> 1:17:43.400\n and that will require putting these things on computers.\n\n1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:45.200\n We're not gonna be able to do calculations there.\n\n1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:49.640\n So much as astrophysics has gone beyond many simplifications\n\n1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:53.280\n to now give really detailed simulations of star systems\n\n1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:54.880\n and galaxies and so forth,\n\n1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:56.880\n we're gonna have to do that with cosmology,\n\n1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:59.120\n and people are starting to do that today.\n\n1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:02.880\n Yeah, I've seen some interesting work on simulation,\n\n1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:05.760\n most simulation cosmology, by the way, is just awesome.\n\n1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:08.720\n But just like simulation of the early formation\n\n1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:12.960\n of our solar system to understand how the like the Oort cloud\n\n1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:16.520\n and just, I don't know, the whole of it,\n\n1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:21.520\n how Earth came to be, like how Jupiter just protects us.\n\n1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:27.600\n And then there's like weird like moons and volcanoes\n\n1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.600\n and like modeling all of that,\n\n1:18:30.600 --> 1:18:34.440\n the formation of all of that is fascinating.\n\n1:18:34.440 --> 1:18:37.120\n Because that naturally is the question\n\n1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:41.200\n of how does life emerge on these kinds of rocks?\n\n1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.000\n How does a rock become a rabbit?\n\n1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:47.440\n But speaking of models,\n\n1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.360\n there's an equation called the Drake equation.\n\n1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:52.720\n We were talking about life.\n\n1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:56.360\n Have to ask, at the highest level first,\n\n1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:58.040\n when you look out there,\n\n1:18:58.040 --> 1:19:01.240\n how many alien civilizations do you think are out there?\n\n1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:04.640\n Well, zero, one, or many?\n\n1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:08.200\n So if you say civilization,\n\n1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:11.440\n I would bring my number way down.\n\n1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:13.880\n It could be zero.\n\n1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.640\n If you talk about life, I think it could be many.\n\n1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:21.800\n As we were saying before,\n\n1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:25.840\n I think the move from life to consciousness,\n\n1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.480\n the kinds of beings that would build\n\n1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:30.720\n what we would recognize as a civilization,\n\n1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:34.240\n that may be extraordinarily rare.\n\n1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.080\n I hope it's not.\n\n1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:38.080\n You know, as a kid, I loved Star Trek.\n\n1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:40.560\n I just loved the idea that we would be part\n\n1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.680\n of some universal community where,\n\n1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:46.000\n look, experience on planet Earth\n\n1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.120\n suggests it doesn't always go so well\n\n1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:50.880\n when groups who are separated try to come together\n\n1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:53.760\n and live in some larger collective.\n\n1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:55.920\n But again, as an optimist,\n\n1:19:55.920 --> 1:19:57.920\n how amazing would it be to converse\n\n1:19:57.920 --> 1:19:59.800\n with an alien civilization and learn\n\n1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:03.600\n what they've figured out about physics and cosmology\n\n1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:06.960\n and compare notes and learn from each other\n\n1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:09.280\n in some wonderful way?\n\n1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:10.480\n I love that idea.\n\n1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:13.800\n But if you ask me the likelihood of it,\n\n1:20:13.800 --> 1:20:18.560\n I would err on saying it may be so improbable\n\n1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.680\n that the conditions conspire to allow life\n\n1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:24.680\n to move to this place of consciousness\n\n1:20:24.680 --> 1:20:27.120\n that it might be rare.\n\n1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:28.640\n It might be oversimplifying things,\n\n1:20:28.640 --> 1:20:32.560\n but just observing the power of the evolutionary process,\n\n1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:34.360\n I tend to believe,\n\n1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:39.000\n and like you read different theories of how we went,\n\n1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.320\n how Homo sapiens evolved,\n\n1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:45.560\n it seems like the evolutionary process\n\n1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:50.040\n naturally leads to Homo sapiens\n\n1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:53.200\n or creatures like that or much better than that.\n\n1:20:53.200 --> 1:20:57.320\n So to me, there's several scary scenarios.\n\n1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:00.760\n So, okay, the positive scenario\n\n1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:03.240\n is life itself is really difficult.\n\n1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:05.840\n So that origin of life is difficult.\n\n1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:08.040\n That's exciting for many reasons\n\n1:21:08.040 --> 1:21:12.520\n because we might be able to prove that wrong easily\n\n1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:14.760\n in the near term by finding life elsewhere.\n\n1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:15.920\n Sure.\n\n1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:20.920\n The scary thing to me is if life is easy\n\n1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.120\n and there's plenty of conscious intelligent civilizations\n\n1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:30.600\n out there and we have not obviously made contact,\n\n1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:33.320\n which means with intelligence and consciousness\n\n1:21:33.320 --> 1:21:38.320\n comes responsibility and ultimately destruction.\n\n1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:42.840\n So with power comes great responsibility\n\n1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:44.760\n and then we end up destroying ourselves.\n\n1:21:44.760 --> 1:21:48.120\n That's the scariest.\n\n1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.200\n The positive, I guess, version is that\n\n1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.040\n maybe we're being watched,\n\n1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:57.200\n sort of like there's a transition\n\n1:21:57.200 --> 1:22:00.720\n to where you don't wanna ruin the primitive villages\n\n1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:04.600\n out there and so there's a protective layer around us.\n\n1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:05.760\n They're watching.\n\n1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:09.520\n So where do you in these possible explanations\n\n1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:10.520\n to the Fermi paradox,\n\n1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:12.240\n why haven't we contacted aliens?\n\n1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:13.600\n Do you land on?\n\n1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:17.720\n Well, I think the most straightforward explanation\n\n1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:19.360\n is that there aren't any.\n\n1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:23.160\n Now, there are many other explanations too.\n\n1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:25.560\n So you can't be dogmatic about things\n\n1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:27.640\n that are just sort of gut feel,\n\n1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:31.800\n but one of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes,\n\n1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:33.280\n I don't know if you ever saw this one\n\n1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:36.280\n where this alien civilization finally comes\n\n1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:39.280\n to planet Earth and gives us this book\n\n1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:42.680\n that they really want us to have and to hold\n\n1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:44.760\n and it's in this foreign language,\n\n1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:45.600\n you don't understand it.\n\n1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:49.120\n The cryptographers, they desperately try to decipher it\n\n1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.480\n as humans are gonna visit this other alien planet\n\n1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:53.720\n and they're all sending back postcards,\n\n1:22:53.720 --> 1:22:55.240\n how wonderful it is and so forth\n\n1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:58.560\n and they finally decipher the title.\n\n1:22:58.560 --> 1:23:01.480\n It's To Serve Man and everyone's so thrilled,\n\n1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:03.680\n oh, they're here to serve us, it all makes sense\n\n1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:06.240\n and then just as one of the final cryptographers\n\n1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:08.160\n is going on to the alien ship,\n\n1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:10.880\n his helper runs and says,\n\n1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.960\n I've deciphered the rest of the book.\n\n1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.920\n To Serve Man, it's a cookbook.\n\n1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:19.920\n So yeah, is that a possibility?\n\n1:23:20.920 --> 1:23:21.760\n Sure.\n\n1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.960\n And so could they be watching us\n\n1:23:23.960 --> 1:23:26.040\n and just sort of waiting for us to get\n\n1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:29.680\n to a mature enough level?\n\n1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:31.120\n I don't know, it strikes me.\n\n1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:33.440\n Well, I think it'd be better to have this conversation\n\n1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:35.040\n after the James Webb Telescope.\n\n1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:38.440\n I mean, I do think that if we look\n\n1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:41.360\n at the atmospheres of many planets,\n\n1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:42.520\n I mean, there's now an estimate now\n\n1:23:42.520 --> 1:23:47.520\n that there's on order of one planet per star on average.\n\n1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.760\n So we've long known that the galaxy,\n\n1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:52.800\n hundreds of billions of stars,\n\n1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:54.800\n numbers of galaxies, hundreds of billions of galaxies.\n\n1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:56.680\n So we're talking about hundreds of billions\n\n1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:59.040\n of hundreds of billions of planets, oh my.\n\n1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:02.320\n And if we start to survey some of these planets\n\n1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:03.840\n and one after the other after the other,\n\n1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:06.360\n we just sort of find no evidence\n\n1:24:06.360 --> 1:24:10.400\n for any of the biological markers.\n\n1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:11.320\n It could be, of course,\n\n1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:13.840\n maybe life takes a radically different form.\n\n1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:15.400\n It'd be hard to know that.\n\n1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:18.280\n But I think that would at least give us some insight\n\n1:24:18.280 --> 1:24:19.360\n on the life question.\n\n1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:21.960\n But I just don't see how we get insight\n\n1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:25.120\n on the civilization or consciousness question\n\n1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:27.560\n without the direct connection.\n\n1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:31.640\n And it strikes me that if consciousness is ubiquitous,\n\n1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:35.080\n let's say life is, I'm willing to grant that.\n\n1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:37.280\n If consciousness is also ubiquitous,\n\n1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:41.680\n then I don't understand why they haven't been here\n\n1:24:41.680 --> 1:24:43.520\n or why there hasn't been separation\n\n1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:47.920\n because presumably they should be much further ahead of us.\n\n1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:50.200\n How unlike would it be that we're like,\n\n1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:52.120\n of all consciousness in the universe,\n\n1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:53.520\n we're the most advanced.\n\n1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:56.960\n That'd be such a special place for human beings\n\n1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:00.160\n that it's hard for me to grant that as a likely possibility.\n\n1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.680\n Rather, I think we're kind of run of the mill.\n\n1:25:02.680 --> 1:25:06.000\n And there are many who are far more advanced than us.\n\n1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:09.080\n And I don't think that they would expend the energy\n\n1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:11.360\n to hide themselves.\n\n1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:12.800\n I don't think they care enough.\n\n1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.880\n And so see, that's actually what I believe\n\n1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:19.160\n that there's a very large number of civilizations\n\n1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:21.440\n that are far more advanced than us.\n\n1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:25.200\n But my sense is that humans are exceptionally limited\n\n1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:29.280\n both in our direct sensory capabilities and our physics,\n\n1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:33.240\n our tools of sensing that just like with the string theory\n\n1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:36.520\n and the multiple dimensions, we're just not like,\n\n1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:39.040\n it's like, I honestly believe there could be stuff\n\n1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:42.760\n in front of our nose that we're just not seeing\n\n1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:48.720\n because we're too dumb, too much hubris\n\n1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.920\n and I mean, there's a bunch of stuff\n\n1:25:50.920 --> 1:25:54.920\n and too ignorant to the fabric of reality,\n\n1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:56.280\n all of those things.\n\n1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:59.840\n We're young in terms of intelligence.\n\n1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:01.880\n But I guess what I'd say is like, I'm on board\n\n1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:04.120\n with all of that as a real possibility,\n\n1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:09.120\n but then it does strike me that we are sufficiently\n\n1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:11.760\n able to observe the unit.\n\n1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:16.760\n Look, we can look back to a fraction of the duration\n\n1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:20.040\n from here to the, just a fraction is left\n\n1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:22.680\n that we are unable to see.\n\n1:26:22.680 --> 1:26:27.320\n So however young we are, we have been able\n\n1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:29.960\n to sort of pierce the universe and it just strikes me\n\n1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:33.280\n that there would be some signature,\n\n1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:35.240\n but maybe that's coming.\n\n1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.080\n But look, having said that I do, look,\n\n1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.560\n I certainly note the fact that it's rare\n\n1:26:41.560 --> 1:26:46.120\n that I stoop down while walking in Manhattan\n\n1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:48.920\n and sort of dig up some ants in the bushes\n\n1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:51.520\n on the side of the street and talk to the ants, right?\n\n1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:52.960\n Because it's just not interesting to me.\n\n1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:56.080\n So if we're like the ants on the cosmological landscape,\n\n1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.760\n then yeah, I can imagine that the super advanced aliens\n\n1:26:58.760 --> 1:27:01.960\n would be like, like whoever, you know,\n\n1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:04.320\n but I feel like we're sufficiently advanced\n\n1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:07.200\n that there should be some signal signature of that,\n\n1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:08.320\n but maybe it's coming.\n\n1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:10.680\n I think the deeper fundamental problem between us\n\n1:27:10.680 --> 1:27:12.760\n and the ants is that we don't have a common language.\n\n1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:14.600\n It's not the interest.\n\n1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.280\n It's that we don't even have a common language.\n\n1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.840\n And so the alien civilizations don't even know how to,\n\n1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:24.720\n like we humans have convinced ourselves we're special\n\n1:27:24.720 --> 1:27:25.880\n because we developed the language.\n\n1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:28.760\n And you talked about the importance of language\n\n1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:31.640\n to the intelligence, but it makes you wonder\n\n1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:36.360\n like how very niche is that like club that we've,\n\n1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:38.440\n like tribe we've created of language\n\n1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:41.480\n and linguistic type of systems that are very specific\n\n1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:42.880\n to our particular kinds of brains\n\n1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:45.240\n and we share ideas together are all super excited\n\n1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.520\n that we can understand the universe\n\n1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:49.320\n because we came up with some notation and math.\n\n1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.440\n I wonder if there's some totally other kinds of language\n\n1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:54.440\n that communicates on a different timescale\n\n1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:56.840\n with different, very different mechanisms\n\n1:27:56.840 --> 1:28:00.080\n in the space of information that just is not,\n\n1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:03.200\n it's everything, everything is lost in translation.\n\n1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:05.120\n Yeah, and it could well be as a look.\n\n1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:07.800\n I mean, I think part of the reason I go\n\n1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:12.800\n toward the possibility of the soul intelligence\n\n1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:16.400\n is there's a certain kind of romantic appeal\n\n1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:20.800\n to looking out in the cosmos and it's just quiet\n\n1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:22.520\n and it's just eternal silence.\n\n1:28:22.520 --> 1:28:25.320\n There's something that appeals to me\n\n1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:27.840\n at an emotional level that way.\n\n1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:31.680\n But yeah, I mean, nobody knows.\n\n1:28:31.680 --> 1:28:35.480\n And it's certainly conceivable\n\n1:28:35.480 --> 1:28:38.640\n that there's just a radical mismatch\n\n1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:40.040\n between the kinds of things\n\n1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:42.840\n that we are able to observe and sensitive to\n\n1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:47.160\n versus the kinds of structures that permeate the universe\n\n1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:50.400\n in a manner that simply we're unable to detect.\n\n1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:54.000\n Well, if we are alone, that is exciting.\n\n1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.560\n And one of the ways it's exciting\n\n1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:00.280\n is that it's up to us to become,\n\n1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:02.760\n to expand out into the universe,\n\n1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:07.760\n to permeate consciousness out into the universe.\n\n1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:09.960\n So that's where space exploration comes in.\n\n1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:12.440\n Let me ask you as somebody who's a screen theorist,\n\n1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:17.120\n a physicist, do you think space exploration,\n\n1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:21.440\n a colonizing space is a physics or an engineering problem?\n\n1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:22.280\n What would you say?\n\n1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:25.440\n Yeah, I think it's fundamentally an engineering problem\n\n1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:30.440\n if we're not trying to do things like build wormholes\n\n1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:32.960\n the way they did, say an interstellar\n\n1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:34.160\n to get to a different place\n\n1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:36.880\n or trying to travel near the speed of light\n\n1:29:36.880 --> 1:29:38.360\n so that we would actually be able\n\n1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:40.120\n to traverse interstellar distances.\n\n1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:41.800\n I mean, without that,\n\n1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:46.800\n our colonization will happen in a very, very slow rate.\n\n1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:50.400\n But one of the beauties of relativity\n\n1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:51.920\n is if you do travel near the speed of light,\n\n1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:56.000\n you can actually go arbitrarily far in a human lifetime.\n\n1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:57.120\n People say, how's that possible?\n\n1:29:57.120 --> 1:29:59.120\n You can't go billions of light years.\n\n1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:01.720\n Billions of light years, well, you can actually,\n\n1:30:01.720 --> 1:30:03.440\n because as you can do the speed of light,\n\n1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:06.080\n the way in which space and time change\n\n1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:08.640\n allows you to go in principle arbitrarily far.\n\n1:30:08.640 --> 1:30:09.960\n That's very exciting.\n\n1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:13.640\n But if we put that physics side of the issue\n\n1:30:13.640 --> 1:30:15.960\n and the manipulation of space and time to the side,\n\n1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:18.360\n yeah, I think it's a deep engineering problem.\n\n1:30:18.360 --> 1:30:21.680\n How do you terraform other planets?\n\n1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:26.680\n I mean, how do you go beyond our local neighborhood,\n\n1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:30.320\n say without using the ideas of relativity?\n\n1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:32.080\n So I think it's all quite exciting.\n\n1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:34.920\n And I think the idea is using solar sails\n\n1:30:34.920 --> 1:30:36.680\n that people have developed\n\n1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.720\n and trying to take that first step to Mars,\n\n1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:43.960\n I think that's a vital and valuable step to take.\n\n1:30:43.960 --> 1:30:44.800\n But yeah, I think these are\n\n1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:46.320\n fundamentally engineering challenges.\n\n1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:49.440\n Or extending the human lifespan through biology research\n\n1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:54.440\n or maybe reducing what it means to be a human being\n\n1:30:54.440 --> 1:30:57.720\n into information and uploading certain parts of it.\n\n1:30:57.720 --> 1:31:00.920\n Maybe not all of the full resolution of a human life,\n\n1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:03.920\n but maybe the essential things like the DNA\n\n1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:06.120\n and be able to reconstruct that human being.\n\n1:31:07.920 --> 1:31:11.160\n But I have to ask about Mars.\n\n1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:17.520\n Do you find the dream of humans stepping on Mars,\n\n1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:20.820\n stepping foot first, but also colonizing Mars,\n\n1:31:20.820 --> 1:31:25.020\n one that's worth us fighting for?\n\n1:31:25.020 --> 1:31:25.980\n Yeah, usually so.\n\n1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:28.500\n I mean, I think what we have long been\n\n1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:32.940\n not always in the best way is a species of explorers\n\n1:31:33.900 --> 1:31:37.020\n in the literal sense of traveling\n\n1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:39.540\n from one part of the world to another,\n\n1:31:39.540 --> 1:31:41.340\n or in the more metaphorical sense\n\n1:31:41.340 --> 1:31:45.100\n of trying to travel through our minds to the quantum realm\n\n1:31:45.100 --> 1:31:47.740\n or back to the Big Bang or to the center of black holes.\n\n1:31:47.740 --> 1:31:51.460\n So I think that's fundamentally part of the human spirit.\n\n1:31:51.460 --> 1:31:56.460\n So I do think that's a vital part of our heritage\n\n1:31:56.860 --> 1:32:01.020\n brought forward into its next incarnation.\n\n1:32:01.020 --> 1:32:01.980\n That's who we are.\n\n1:32:03.740 --> 1:32:06.860\n Do you think there'll be a day in the future\n\n1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:11.300\n where a human being is born on Mars\n\n1:32:11.300 --> 1:32:16.300\n and has to learn about his or her human origins on Earth?\n\n1:32:16.300 --> 1:32:17.900\n Like, they'll have to read in a book.\n\n1:32:18.860 --> 1:32:20.420\n Yeah, I don't think it'll be a book at that stage.\n\n1:32:20.420 --> 1:32:22.900\n It'll probably just be uploaded into the head or something\n\n1:32:22.900 --> 1:32:25.220\n or imprinted into the DNA,\n\n1:32:25.220 --> 1:32:26.900\n and then they just sort of sense it.\n\n1:32:26.900 --> 1:32:29.540\n But yeah, I think there's, well, look,\n\n1:32:29.540 --> 1:32:32.340\n the issue you raised before is the vital one.\n\n1:32:32.340 --> 1:32:36.020\n Is it the case that any sufficiently advanced civilization\n\n1:32:36.020 --> 1:32:37.420\n destroys itself?\n\n1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:39.820\n Is that sort of a commonplace quality?\n\n1:32:39.820 --> 1:32:41.460\n I mean, that's the other potential answer\n\n1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.220\n to the Fermi paradox.\n\n1:32:43.220 --> 1:32:44.060\n Why aren't they here?\n\n1:32:44.060 --> 1:32:47.020\n Because by the time they got to the technological development\n\n1:32:47.020 --> 1:32:49.140\n where they could travel here, they blew themselves up.\n\n1:32:49.140 --> 1:32:50.300\n They destroyed themselves.\n\n1:32:50.300 --> 1:32:53.060\n And that's an unfortunate,\n\n1:32:53.060 --> 1:32:57.100\n but not a hard to imagine possibility\n\n1:32:57.100 --> 1:33:01.020\n based on things that have happened here on planet Earth.\n\n1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:02.980\n But putting that to the side,\n\n1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:05.460\n I think that's the big obstacle,\n\n1:33:05.460 --> 1:33:06.460\n but putting that to the side,\n\n1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:09.140\n we will resolve the engineering challenges.\n\n1:33:09.140 --> 1:33:12.940\n And I should probably modify my answer\n\n1:33:12.940 --> 1:33:15.940\n from before when you said, is it engineering or physics?\n\n1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:17.460\n It's really both, right?\n\n1:33:17.460 --> 1:33:20.460\n So we will surmount the engineering challenges\n\n1:33:20.460 --> 1:33:23.620\n and that will then make the physics challenges relevant.\n\n1:33:23.620 --> 1:33:24.980\n It'll make it relevant to figure out\n\n1:33:24.980 --> 1:33:26.900\n how to travel near the speed of light.\n\n1:33:26.900 --> 1:33:27.980\n It'll make it relevant to learn\n\n1:33:27.980 --> 1:33:32.180\n how to manipulate the shape of space time and so forth.\n\n1:33:32.180 --> 1:33:35.660\n So I think it's a multi stage process\n\n1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:38.100\n where it is engineering and ultimately physics.\n\n1:33:38.100 --> 1:33:40.380\n And if we stick around long enough,\n\n1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:41.380\n those are the kinds of challenges\n\n1:33:41.380 --> 1:33:43.460\n I think that we're ultimately gonna surmount.\n\n1:33:43.460 --> 1:33:45.340\n And then the physics side is figuring out\n\n1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:46.700\n how to harness energy enough\n\n1:33:46.700 --> 1:33:48.700\n to travel outside the solar system,\n\n1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:51.140\n which seems like a heck of a difficult journey.\n\n1:33:51.140 --> 1:33:52.780\n But even Mars itself,\n\n1:33:54.780 --> 1:33:57.420\n I don't know, maybe because I was born in the Soviet Union\n\n1:33:57.420 --> 1:34:00.900\n and was born with the,\n\n1:34:02.140 --> 1:34:04.660\n looking up at the stars and that dream\n\n1:34:04.660 --> 1:34:06.740\n of like the highest of human achievement\n\n1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:08.900\n is the ability to fly out there,\n\n1:34:08.900 --> 1:34:10.380\n to join the stars.\n\n1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:13.220\n I really liked the idea of going to Mars\n\n1:34:13.220 --> 1:34:15.580\n and not just stepping foot on Mars.\n\n1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:20.580\n And it wasn't until maybe misinformed,\n\n1:34:21.060 --> 1:34:22.540\n but for me personally,\n\n1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:26.420\n it wasn't until Elon Musk started talking\n\n1:34:26.420 --> 1:34:28.700\n about the colonization of Mars,\n\n1:34:28.700 --> 1:34:33.700\n did I realize like we humans can actually do that.\n\n1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:38.100\n And first of all, the importance of somebody saying\n\n1:34:38.100 --> 1:34:42.780\n that we can do these seemingly impossible things\n\n1:34:42.780 --> 1:34:47.780\n is immeasurable because the fact that he placed that\n\n1:34:48.660 --> 1:34:52.140\n into my mind and into the minds of millions of others,\n\n1:34:52.140 --> 1:34:54.860\n maybe hundreds of millions, maybe billions of others,\n\n1:34:54.860 --> 1:34:58.660\n young kids today, I mean, that's gonna make it a reality.\n\n1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:00.900\n I, for some reason, am deeply excited,\n\n1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:06.260\n even though my work isn't AI that echoes all of this.\n\n1:35:06.260 --> 1:35:09.500\n I'm excited by the idea that somebody would be born,\n\n1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:14.180\n as we were saying, on Mars and sort of look up\n\n1:35:14.180 --> 1:35:16.660\n and be able to see with a telescope Earth\n\n1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:19.340\n and say, that's where I came from.\n\n1:35:19.340 --> 1:35:23.540\n I don't know, that idea scale to other planets,\n\n1:35:23.540 --> 1:35:26.620\n to other solar systems, that's really exciting.\n\n1:35:26.620 --> 1:35:28.020\n And hugely exciting.\n\n1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:29.300\n I think you're absolutely right.\n\n1:35:29.300 --> 1:35:33.820\n I mean, the vital thing is to dream, right?\n\n1:35:33.820 --> 1:35:36.380\n I mean, and it sounds hackneyed,\n\n1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:40.340\n but it is so important for young kids,\n\n1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:42.220\n for the next generation,\n\n1:35:42.220 --> 1:35:45.460\n to think about the things that are seemingly impossible.\n\n1:35:45.460 --> 1:35:47.140\n I mean, that's what makes them possible.\n\n1:35:47.140 --> 1:35:50.300\n And this is one which is concrete enough.\n\n1:35:50.300 --> 1:35:52.100\n I mean, this is something that's gonna happen soon\n\n1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:54.820\n in terms of actually going to Mars.\n\n1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:59.820\n And then the next step of establishing some presence,\n\n1:36:00.340 --> 1:36:02.620\n some semi permanent or permanent presence.\n\n1:36:02.620 --> 1:36:05.460\n This is not something that's gonna wait\n\n1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:06.580\n to the 25th century.\n\n1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:07.740\n I mean, this is something that's gonna happen\n\n1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:09.140\n relatively soon.\n\n1:36:09.140 --> 1:36:11.220\n So, I mean, it could well be in your lifetime,\n\n1:36:11.220 --> 1:36:13.660\n unlikely mine, but possibly in your lifetime\n\n1:36:13.660 --> 1:36:15.460\n that that kid will be born\n\n1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:18.260\n and have the experience that you described.\n\n1:36:18.260 --> 1:36:20.740\n So yeah, it's spectacularly exciting.\n\n1:36:21.620 --> 1:36:24.260\n And I actually, I would love to go on Mars\n\n1:36:24.260 --> 1:36:25.900\n on one of the early.\n\n1:36:25.900 --> 1:36:26.740\n You would? Yeah.\n\n1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:28.180\n It would if it's one way.\n\n1:36:28.180 --> 1:36:29.900\n I'm happy to do it one way. Really?\n\n1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:30.740\n Wow. Yeah.\n\n1:36:30.740 --> 1:36:32.540\n I'm single if there's ladies out there\n\n1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:34.540\n that wanna start that family.\n\n1:36:34.540 --> 1:36:36.540\n Let's go out to Mars.\n\n1:36:36.540 --> 1:36:37.740\n No, I think.\n\n1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:38.580\n See, I have to tell you something.\n\n1:36:38.580 --> 1:36:42.700\n You spoke about terror, thinking about like black holes.\n\n1:36:42.700 --> 1:36:45.420\n If I actually think about going to Mars\n\n1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:49.740\n and being on Mars and put myself in there fully,\n\n1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:51.780\n that's terror inducing.\n\n1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:54.940\n The idea of to be in this foreign world\n\n1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:56.740\n where you can't come back,\n\n1:36:56.740 --> 1:37:00.060\n where you've made this choice that can't be reversed.\n\n1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:01.700\n Well, at some point it may be,\n\n1:37:01.700 --> 1:37:06.700\n but in that guise, that to me carries a deep sense of terror.\n\n1:37:08.780 --> 1:37:11.100\n I feel that sense of terror every time Kerouac,\n\n1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:13.860\n Jack Kerouac talked about this on the road\n\n1:37:13.860 --> 1:37:17.420\n is when you leave a place, if you're honest about it,\n\n1:37:18.540 --> 1:37:19.860\n like life is short.\n\n1:37:20.740 --> 1:37:23.140\n And when you leave a place, you move to a new place\n\n1:37:23.140 --> 1:37:25.220\n and you think of all the friends, maybe family\n\n1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:28.060\n you're leaving behind as you drive over the hill,\n\n1:37:28.060 --> 1:37:31.460\n that really is goodbye.\n\n1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:33.260\n Like we sometimes don't think of it that way\n\n1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:36.220\n when we're moving, but that really is goodbye to that life,\n\n1:37:36.220 --> 1:37:38.620\n to the person you were, to all the people.\n\n1:37:38.620 --> 1:37:41.780\n Maybe if it's close friends, you'll see them maybe 10, 15\n\n1:37:41.780 --> 1:37:43.820\n more times in your life and that's it.\n\n1:37:43.820 --> 1:37:46.100\n And you're saying goodbye to all of that.\n\n1:37:46.100 --> 1:37:50.180\n And so in the same way, I see it as way more dramatic\n\n1:37:50.180 --> 1:37:52.620\n when you're flying away from earth and it's like,\n\n1:37:52.620 --> 1:37:56.180\n it's goodbye to Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks.\n\n1:37:56.180 --> 1:37:59.420\n And it's goodbye to whatever, I don't know why I picked\n\n1:37:59.420 --> 1:38:03.820\n those, but some, all the things that are special to earth,\n\n1:38:03.820 --> 1:38:06.900\n it's goodbye, but that's life.\n\n1:38:06.900 --> 1:38:11.700\n I suppose more, what excites me about that kind of journey\n\n1:38:11.700 --> 1:38:14.780\n is it's a distinct contemplation of your mortality,\n\n1:38:14.780 --> 1:38:16.660\n acceptance of your mortality.\n\n1:38:16.660 --> 1:38:20.420\n You're saying, just like when you take on any difficult\n\n1:38:20.420 --> 1:38:25.180\n journey, it's accepting that you're going to die one day\n\n1:38:25.180 --> 1:38:28.740\n and might as well do something truly exciting.\n\n1:38:28.740 --> 1:38:31.580\n Yes, I mean, I will, you know, I'm with you on that.\n\n1:38:31.580 --> 1:38:36.580\n I'm a strong believer that deep underneath human motivation\n\n1:38:36.780 --> 1:38:41.020\n is this terror of our own mortality.\n\n1:38:41.020 --> 1:38:43.180\n Yeah, there's this a wonderful book that had a great\n\n1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:47.580\n influence in me called The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker.\n\n1:38:47.580 --> 1:38:52.580\n And when you are aware of the ways in which our mortality\n\n1:38:52.580 --> 1:38:57.020\n influences our behaviors, it really does add a different\n\n1:38:57.020 --> 1:38:59.940\n slant, a different kind of color to the interpretation\n\n1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:01.620\n of human behavior.\n\n1:39:01.620 --> 1:39:05.620\n Yeah, it's funny that that book had a big influence\n\n1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:06.460\n in me as well.\n\n1:39:06.460 --> 1:39:07.300\n Oh, is that right?\n\n1:39:07.300 --> 1:39:08.140\n Wow.\n\n1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:12.140\n And the terror management theory and I, again,\n\n1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:14.620\n from an engineering perspective, I don't know how many\n\n1:39:14.620 --> 1:39:19.100\n people that book influenced because I talk to people\n\n1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:21.220\n about the fear of death and it doesn't seem like\n\n1:39:21.220 --> 1:39:24.140\n about the fear of death and it doesn't seem to be\n\n1:39:24.140 --> 1:39:26.580\n that fundamental to their experience.\n\n1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:28.860\n And I don't think on the surface it's fundamental\n\n1:39:28.860 --> 1:39:30.740\n to my experience, but it seems like an awfully,\n\n1:39:30.740 --> 1:39:33.380\n in terms of we talk about models and strength theory\n\n1:39:33.380 --> 1:39:37.380\n and theories, in terms of theories of this macro experience\n\n1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:40.940\n of human life, it seems like a heck of a good theory\n\n1:39:40.940 --> 1:39:43.980\n that the fear of death is at the kind of is the warm\n\n1:39:43.980 --> 1:39:44.820\n at the core.\n\n1:39:44.820 --> 1:39:47.420\n Yeah, well, I mean, and the terror management theories\n\n1:39:47.420 --> 1:39:51.060\n that you make reference to, I mean, this is a group\n\n1:39:51.060 --> 1:39:54.380\n of psychologists, social psychologists who devise\n\n1:39:54.380 --> 1:39:58.340\n these very clever experiments, real world experiments\n\n1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:02.140\n with real people, where you can directly measure\n\n1:40:02.140 --> 1:40:05.580\n the hidden influence of the recognition\n\n1:40:05.580 --> 1:40:07.460\n of our own mortality.\n\n1:40:07.460 --> 1:40:09.220\n I mean, they've done these experiments where they have\n\n1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:11.540\n group of people A, group of people B,\n\n1:40:11.540 --> 1:40:12.900\n and the only difference between the two groups\n\n1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:16.180\n is that group B, they somehow reminded them\n\n1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:18.060\n in some subtle way of their own mortality.\n\n1:40:18.060 --> 1:40:21.180\n Sometimes it's nothing more than interviewing them\n\n1:40:21.180 --> 1:40:23.940\n with a funeral home across the street.\n\n1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:25.820\n And influence is there, but it's subtle,\n\n1:40:25.820 --> 1:40:27.500\n you don't even think you'd take note of.\n\n1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:32.260\n And they can find measurable effects that differentiate\n\n1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:36.300\n the two groups to a high degree of statistical significance\n\n1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:38.900\n and how they respond to certain challenges\n\n1:40:38.900 --> 1:40:42.820\n or certain kinds of questions that shows a direct influence\n\n1:40:42.820 --> 1:40:45.980\n of the reminder of their own mortality.\n\n1:40:45.980 --> 1:40:48.620\n And I've read a number of these studies\n\n1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:51.660\n and they are really convincing.\n\n1:40:51.660 --> 1:40:54.060\n And so yeah, I would say that the reason why\n\n1:40:54.060 --> 1:40:58.060\n so many people would say that, yeah, fear of mortality,\n\n1:40:58.060 --> 1:41:01.140\n it's not front and center in my worldview.\n\n1:41:01.140 --> 1:41:02.380\n Yeah, I don't really think about it much,\n\n1:41:02.380 --> 1:41:03.300\n it doesn't really matter too much.\n\n1:41:03.300 --> 1:41:05.100\n The reason why they're able to say that\n\n1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:08.540\n is because this thing called culture has emerged\n\n1:41:08.540 --> 1:41:10.780\n over the course of the last 10,000 years.\n\n1:41:10.780 --> 1:41:14.260\n And part of the role of culture is to give us a means\n\n1:41:14.260 --> 1:41:17.060\n of not thinking about our mortality all the time,\n\n1:41:17.060 --> 1:41:20.020\n of not living in terror of the inevitable end,\n\n1:41:20.020 --> 1:41:21.780\n which faces us all.\n\n1:41:21.780 --> 1:41:24.500\n So it's completely understandable that that's the response\n\n1:41:24.500 --> 1:41:27.860\n because that's what culture is at least in part for.\n\n1:41:27.860 --> 1:41:32.300\n Is it at least possible that the fear of death,\n\n1:41:32.300 --> 1:41:36.300\n the terror of your mortality is the creative force\n\n1:41:36.300 --> 1:41:39.020\n that created all of the things around us\n\n1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:41.540\n at this human civilization?\n\n1:41:41.540 --> 1:41:45.020\n And I think about from an engineering perspective,\n\n1:41:45.020 --> 1:41:49.220\n this is where I lose all of my robotics colleagues\n\n1:41:49.220 --> 1:41:52.580\n is I feel like if you want to create intelligence,\n\n1:41:52.580 --> 1:41:57.580\n you have to also engineer in some kind of echoes\n\n1:41:58.140 --> 1:41:59.740\n of this kind of fear.\n\n1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.420\n Fear is such a complicated word,\n\n1:42:03.420 --> 1:42:06.860\n but it's kind of like a scarcity,\n\n1:42:06.860 --> 1:42:10.540\n a scarcity of time, a scarcity of resources\n\n1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:12.500\n that creates a kind of anxiety,\n\n1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:15.460\n like deadlines get you to do stuff.\n\n1:42:15.460 --> 1:42:18.460\n And there's something almost fundamental to that\n\n1:42:18.460 --> 1:42:21.460\n in terms of human experience.\n\n1:42:21.460 --> 1:42:22.660\n Yeah, well, that's an interesting thought.\n\n1:42:22.660 --> 1:42:27.660\n So you're basically in order to create a kind of structure\n\n1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:34.300\n that mirrors what we call consciousness.\n\n1:42:34.300 --> 1:42:38.820\n You'd better have that structure confront the same kinds\n\n1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:41.980\n of issues and terrors that we do.\n\n1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:44.180\n Consciousness and suffering only makes sense\n\n1:42:44.180 --> 1:42:45.620\n in the context of death.\n\n1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:48.100\n If you want to, I feel like,\n\n1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:50.740\n if you want to fit into human society,\n\n1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:54.420\n if you're a robot and if you want to fit into human society,\n\n1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:59.100\n you better have the same kind of existential dread,\n\n1:42:59.100 --> 1:43:00.740\n the same kind of fear of mortality,\n\n1:43:00.740 --> 1:43:02.340\n otherwise you're not gonna fit in.\n\n1:43:02.340 --> 1:43:03.180\n Right.\n\n1:43:03.180 --> 1:43:04.020\n Right.\n\n1:43:04.020 --> 1:43:06.180\n That's good.\n\n1:43:06.180 --> 1:43:09.580\n It might be wild, but it's at least,\n\n1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:11.380\n like we're talking about all the theories\n\n1:43:11.380 --> 1:43:13.700\n that are at least worth consideration.\n\n1:43:13.700 --> 1:43:15.780\n I think that's a really powerful one.\n\n1:43:15.780 --> 1:43:19.180\n And definitely one has resonated with me\n\n1:43:19.180 --> 1:43:23.300\n and definitely seems to capture something\n\n1:43:25.700 --> 1:43:30.700\n beautifully like real about the human condition.\n\n1:43:31.340 --> 1:43:34.180\n And I wonder, it's of course,\n\n1:43:34.180 --> 1:43:38.260\n it sucks to think that we need death to appreciate life,\n\n1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:43.180\n but that's just maybe the way it is.\n\n1:43:43.180 --> 1:43:44.500\n Well, it's interesting if this robotic\n\n1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:49.420\n or artificially intelligent system understands the world\n\n1:43:49.420 --> 1:43:51.700\n and understands the second law of thermodynamics\n\n1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:55.540\n and entropy, even an artificial intelligence will realize\n\n1:43:55.540 --> 1:43:59.220\n that even if its parts are really robust,\n\n1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:02.380\n ultimately it will disintegrate.\n\n1:44:02.380 --> 1:44:03.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:03.220 --> 1:44:05.180\n The timescales may be different,\n\n1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:06.980\n but in a way, when you think about it, it doesn't matter.\n\n1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:09.220\n Once you know that you are mortal\n\n1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:11.580\n in the sense that you are not eternal,\n\n1:44:11.580 --> 1:44:13.740\n the timescale hardly matters\n\n1:44:13.740 --> 1:44:17.940\n because it's either the whole thing or not.\n\n1:44:17.940 --> 1:44:19.740\n Because on the scales of eternity,\n\n1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:23.700\n any finite duration, however large is effectively zero\n\n1:44:23.700 --> 1:44:25.580\n on the scales of eternity.\n\n1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:28.820\n And so maybe it won't be so hard for an artificial system\n\n1:44:28.820 --> 1:44:32.020\n to feel that sense of mortality\n\n1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:35.220\n because it will recognize the underlying physical laws\n\n1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.540\n and recognize its own finitude.\n\n1:44:38.540 --> 1:44:41.340\n And then it'll be us and robots drinking beers,\n\n1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:43.620\n looking up at the stars and just,\n\n1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:51.100\n having a good laugh in awe of the whole thing.\n\n1:44:51.100 --> 1:44:51.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:44:53.140 --> 1:44:55.500\n I think that's a pretty good way to end it,\n\n1:44:55.500 --> 1:44:57.340\n talking about the fear of death.\n\n1:44:57.340 --> 1:44:59.820\n We started talking about the meaning of life\n\n1:44:59.820 --> 1:45:01.060\n and ended on the fear of death.\n\n1:45:01.060 --> 1:45:03.140\n Brian, this is an incredible conversation.\n\n1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:03.980\n My pleasure, thank you.\n\n1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:04.820\n I enjoyed it enormously.\n\n1:45:04.820 --> 1:45:05.660\n I really, really enjoyed it.\n\n1:45:05.660 --> 1:45:06.700\n It's been a long time coming.\n\n1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:09.700\n I'm a huge fan of your work, a huge fan of your writing.\n\n1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:10.700\n Thanks for talking to me, Brian.\n\n1:45:10.700 --> 1:45:12.060\n Thank you.\n\n1:45:12.060 --> 1:45:13.580\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:14.780\n with Brian Greene.\n\n1:45:14.780 --> 1:45:16.100\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:18.900\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:45:18.900 --> 1:45:22.940\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Bill Bryson.\n\n1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:25.500\n \"'Physics is really nothing more\n\n1:45:25.500 --> 1:45:27.860\n \"'than a search for ultimate simplicity.\n\n1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:32.860\n \"'But so far, all we have is a kind of elegant messiness.'\"\n\n1:45:32.860 --> 1:45:57.860\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
