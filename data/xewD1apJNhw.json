Sears Tower,\n\n00:05.460 --> 00:06.960\n like they say in Fight Club,\n\n00:06.960 --> 00:09.160\n Bobby will go back to his gatherer form\n\n00:09.160 --> 00:11.320\n and be happy as a pig in shit,\n\n00:11.320 --> 00:12.700\n just walking around in a loincloth\n\n00:12.700 --> 00:14.080\n with his bird hanging out,\n\n00:14.080 --> 00:16.280\n tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them\n\n00:16.280 --> 00:18.520\n for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.\n\n00:18.520 --> 00:22.240\n Do you think some level of crazy is required for comedy?\n\n00:22.240 --> 00:24.120\n Like, at some point?\n\n00:24.120 --> 00:25.560\n Yes.\n\n00:25.560 --> 00:27.760\n Have there been low points in your life?\n\n00:27.760 --> 00:30.560\n Yeah, I don't know, hey, hey.\n\n00:30.560 --> 00:31.380\n Eh?\n\n00:31.380 --> 00:32.220\n Eh?\n\n00:32.220 --> 00:33.060\n Eh?\n\n00:33.060 --> 00:33.900\n Ha ha ha ha.\n\n00:35.600 --> 00:38.800\n The following is a conversation with Will Sasso,\n\n00:38.800 --> 00:41.480\n a comedian, actor, podcaster,\n\n00:41.480 --> 00:44.140\n and someone I've been a fan of for many years\n\n00:44.140 --> 00:46.940\n since Mad TV in the late 90s\n\n00:46.940 --> 00:50.320\n to recently with the 10 Minute Podcast\n\n00:50.320 --> 00:54.620\n and now the new podcast called Doodzee.\n\n00:54.620 --> 00:56.440\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.\n\n00:56.440 --> 00:58.320\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:58.320 --> 00:59.520\n in the description.\n\n00:59.520 --> 01:02.920\n And now, dear friends, here's Will Sasso.\n\n01:03.960 --> 01:06.760\n So let's call out the elephant in the room.\n\n01:06.760 --> 01:10.720\n You wore a black suit in a recent episode of Doodzee.\n\n01:10.720 --> 01:11.560\n Yes.\n\n01:13.320 --> 01:15.320\n You wore a black suit again today.\n\n01:15.320 --> 01:18.660\n Shakespeare, then Mark Twain, said clothes make the man.\n\n01:20.000 --> 01:22.320\n What kind of man does a suit make you?\n\n01:22.320 --> 01:25.360\n Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow\n\n01:25.360 --> 01:28.320\n who did not get this dry cleaned in between\n\n01:28.320 --> 01:30.920\n because that episode of the show as we sit here now\n\n01:30.920 --> 01:32.560\n was around a week ago.\n\n01:32.560 --> 01:35.160\n So that's the kind of man it makes me.\n\n01:35.160 --> 01:38.360\n Well, the nice thing is you're wearing pants, I think.\n\n01:38.360 --> 01:39.200\n Yes, I am wearing pants.\n\n01:39.200 --> 01:41.400\n I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode.\n\n01:41.400 --> 01:42.240\n That's correct.\n\n01:42.240 --> 01:45.120\n I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion\n\n01:45.120 --> 01:48.520\n so I'm wearing pants and I thought it fitting, obviously,\n\n01:48.520 --> 01:51.120\n to just wear the black tie.\n\n01:51.120 --> 01:53.020\n And clothes do make the man.\n\n01:53.020 --> 01:56.960\n And I would not consider myself to be a man of leisure,\n\n01:56.960 --> 02:00.920\n but I do enjoy shorts because my legs get hot.\n\n02:00.920 --> 02:02.840\n So that's what kind of man the shorts make me.\n\n02:02.840 --> 02:03.960\n How often do you wear a suit?\n\n02:03.960 --> 02:05.480\n I fucking hate wearing suits.\n\n02:05.480 --> 02:09.120\n So what is this, a statement of, is it ironic?\n\n02:09.120 --> 02:12.080\n Or are you honoring the gods of this particular podcast?\n\n02:12.080 --> 02:14.080\n I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast\n\n02:14.080 --> 02:15.240\n would be a good way to put it.\n\n02:15.240 --> 02:19.840\n Yes, no, this is in reverence of and in dedication to you\n\n02:19.840 --> 02:21.880\n and our newfound friendship here,\n\n02:21.880 --> 02:26.000\n which we are making on the podcast.\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:27.400\n You and I just met.\n\n02:27.400 --> 02:28.560\n Everything that we're saying here\n\n02:28.560 --> 02:31.120\n is the first things that we're saying to each other.\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:33.800\n So I'm meeting you on common ground dressed like.\n\n02:33.800 --> 02:36.160\n Well, I've been actually a one way friend of yours\n\n02:36.160 --> 02:38.160\n for many, many years since Mad TV.\n\n02:38.160 --> 02:39.140\n Oh.\n\n02:39.140 --> 02:40.320\n When did you start on Mad TV?\n\n02:40.320 --> 02:42.280\n So that was, I mean, in 90s?\n\n02:42.280 --> 02:43.100\n 97, yeah.\n\n02:43.100 --> 02:44.020\n 97.\n\n02:44.020 --> 02:46.640\n So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible.\n\n02:46.640 --> 02:49.000\n It was one of the funniest shows ever created.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.000\n Your whole journey watching through that\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.200\n was incredible from Mad TV to Three Stooges\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:57.040\n to the podcasts, the 10 Minute Pod\n\n02:57.040 --> 02:59.340\n and then the new podcast is incredible.\n\n03:00.360 --> 03:01.200\n Cheers.\n\n03:01.200 --> 03:02.760\n My favorite role that you played\n\n03:02.760 --> 03:05.880\n was the mountain in the Game of Thrones.\n\n03:05.880 --> 03:08.080\n What was it like working with dragons?\n\n03:08.080 --> 03:11.000\n Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls\n\n03:11.000 --> 03:16.000\n on the end of C stands, but sometimes they hang out.\n\n03:17.340 --> 03:18.180\n I am.\n\n03:18.180 --> 03:19.000\n It's a C stand.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.080\n It's like, you know, it's like a little,\n\n03:20.080 --> 03:21.640\n like the thing you got the camera on here.\n\n03:21.640 --> 03:22.980\n Oh, this is like film lingo.\n\n03:22.980 --> 03:23.960\n Yeah, no, I understand.\n\n03:23.960 --> 03:25.680\n I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo.\n\n03:25.680 --> 03:27.320\n You know what a banana is?\n\n03:27.320 --> 03:28.160\n Yeah.\n\n03:28.160 --> 03:29.000\n It's when you walk like this.\n\n03:29.000 --> 03:29.840\n Oh.\n\n03:29.840 --> 03:30.660\n Do a banana.\n\n03:30.660 --> 03:31.500\n I take it back.\n\n03:31.500 --> 03:32.340\n I did not know what a banana was.\n\n03:32.340 --> 03:33.180\n Yeah, see?\n\n03:33.180 --> 03:34.160\n I misunderstood.\n\n03:34.160 --> 03:35.880\n Yeah, cause it's just a food.\n\n03:35.880 --> 03:36.720\n Yeah.\n\n03:36.720 --> 03:37.560\n Normally.\n\n03:37.560 --> 03:40.080\n You fancy Hollywood folk with a lingo.\n\n03:40.080 --> 03:44.240\n And I'm, my name is Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson\n\n03:44.240 --> 03:47.040\n and I am seven foot four and yeah.\n\n03:47.040 --> 03:49.240\n So dragons don't, dragons don't scare me\n\n03:49.240 --> 03:51.600\n even though they've been extinct for a while.\n\n03:51.600 --> 03:52.920\n You're a scientist, right?\n\n03:52.920 --> 03:54.160\n Is that checkout?\n\n03:54.160 --> 03:56.600\n Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games.\n\n03:56.600 --> 03:57.640\n I don't know if you play video games.\n\n03:57.640 --> 04:01.720\n There's a, there's a Skyrim video game\n\n04:01.720 --> 04:03.320\n that's part of the Elder Scrolls series.\n\n04:03.320 --> 04:04.400\n And for the longest time,\n\n04:04.400 --> 04:06.440\n there's a legend that there's dragons.\n\n04:06.440 --> 04:07.800\n I think it started in Daggerfall.\n\n04:07.800 --> 04:10.500\n And so I always, I grew up playing those video games\n\n04:10.500 --> 04:14.160\n and dreaming of one day meeting a dragon in a virtual world.\n\n04:14.160 --> 04:16.840\n And eventually you did in Skyrim.\n\n04:16.840 --> 04:19.760\n So it's, dragons represent,\n\n04:19.760 --> 04:21.120\n I don't know exactly what they represent,\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:24.560\n but they represent maybe this kind of mythical creature\n\n04:24.560 --> 04:27.960\n that is bigger than anything humans\n\n04:27.960 --> 04:30.880\n can possibly comprehend maybe.\n\n04:30.880 --> 04:33.960\n Cause they're so, they're so, they show up so often in myth\n\n04:33.960 --> 04:37.640\n from the, from the religious stories, you know,\n\n04:37.640 --> 04:39.280\n of the snake and so on, the serpent.\n\n04:39.280 --> 04:40.920\n And I don't know what that is.\n\n04:40.920 --> 04:42.680\n Well, this breathing fire, that's kind of weird.\n\n04:42.680 --> 04:44.240\n It's interesting when I think about dragons,\n\n04:44.240 --> 04:45.480\n cause now that you bring it up,\n\n04:45.480 --> 04:47.440\n these are people that probably wouldn't have access\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:49.480\n to the fact that there used to be dinosaurs.\n\n04:49.480 --> 04:50.840\n Maybe they did.\n\n04:50.840 --> 04:54.820\n If they didn't, they're drawing things that look like,\n\n04:54.820 --> 04:57.200\n you know, a dinosaur cousin, but cool,\n\n04:57.200 --> 05:01.080\n that can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail.\n\n05:02.680 --> 05:04.280\n Yeah, where the heck did they come up with that?\n\n05:04.280 --> 05:07.200\n Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology\n\n05:07.200 --> 05:10.640\n all the way back to, no, not cave drawings.\n\n05:10.640 --> 05:12.560\n Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the,\n\n05:12.560 --> 05:13.580\n and they could time travel.\n\n05:13.580 --> 05:15.680\n So they would have gone back to the caves.\n\n05:15.680 --> 05:19.200\n Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:23.820\n could time travel and they could plant legends\n\n05:23.820 --> 05:25.920\n into the, into the collective intelligence\n\n05:25.920 --> 05:27.520\n of the human species.\n\n05:27.520 --> 05:29.400\n Yeah, and perhaps they were thinking of us\n\n05:29.400 --> 05:30.600\n to do something smart with it.\n\n05:30.600 --> 05:32.240\n And we didn't, we just came up with the sky.\n\n05:32.240 --> 05:33.080\n No.\n\n05:33.080 --> 05:33.900\n We're just, what's that?\n\n05:33.900 --> 05:35.000\n Sorry, that was very offensive.\n\n05:35.000 --> 05:37.960\n I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you with your video game.\n\n05:37.960 --> 05:42.640\n I'm more of a burger time Donkey Kong dude.\n\n05:42.640 --> 05:44.040\n Oh, what is that?\n\n05:44.040 --> 05:45.120\n That's an original.\n\n05:45.120 --> 05:48.320\n Burger time was an arcade game that later showed up\n\n05:48.320 --> 05:52.720\n on the Intellivision, it was Intellivision.\n\n05:52.720 --> 05:54.960\n I believe it was made by Texas Instruments,\n\n05:54.960 --> 05:58.440\n horrible first generation video game console.\n\n05:58.440 --> 06:00.600\n And burger time, you just, it's like Super Mario.\n\n06:00.600 --> 06:03.000\n You just got to stay away from the eggs\n\n06:03.000 --> 06:04.360\n and the pickles and stuff.\n\n06:04.360 --> 06:07.080\n And you just go, and the bun falls.\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:11.160\n And then you go down to the and the cheese and then the meat.\n\n06:11.160 --> 06:12.520\n I'm not going to say it's as complicated\n\n06:12.520 --> 06:16.280\n as Skyrim, but took me a while to finish it when I was seven.\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:20.540\n Did you play video games, was that a part of your life,\n\n06:20.540 --> 06:22.960\n a part of the source of happiness for you at all?\n\n06:22.960 --> 06:24.040\n It was, it was.\n\n06:24.040 --> 06:28.840\n I played video games up until around, I think in 2010,\n\n06:28.840 --> 06:31.760\n I got the Red Ring of Death on my Xbox 360.\n\n06:31.760 --> 06:32.600\n That was it?\n\n06:32.600 --> 06:33.420\n That was it.\n\n06:33.420 --> 06:35.200\n I never, or whatever the Xbox was then.\n\n06:35.200 --> 06:36.040\n Yeah.\n\n06:36.040 --> 06:40.320\n I had, I was playing, I had finished the Grand Theft Auto\n\n06:40.320 --> 06:42.840\n that was out and finished the Red Dead Redemption.\n\n06:42.840 --> 06:46.400\n So I was doing that thing where you just drive around,\n\n06:46.400 --> 06:49.080\n you know, the streets of New York or just ride around\n\n06:49.080 --> 06:51.500\n on your horse shooting people and, you know,\n\n06:51.500 --> 06:55.080\n throwing grenades into groups of people in Grand Theft.\n\n06:55.080 --> 06:57.600\n And you're describing the same thing that happened\n\n06:57.600 --> 07:01.160\n a decade later, because it's now Red Dead Redemption 2\n\n07:01.160 --> 07:03.920\n and there's still not a new Grand Theft Auto, so.\n\n07:03.920 --> 07:05.120\n Yeah, there isn't, right?\n\n07:05.120 --> 07:06.000\n Yeah, they're working on it.\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:07.880\n They're always flirting with that idea.\n\n07:07.880 --> 07:10.100\n You know who else plays Skyrim?\n\n07:10.100 --> 07:12.480\n Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of\n\n07:12.480 --> 07:14.760\n from that time in Matt TV is Bobby Lee.\n\n07:14.760 --> 07:15.720\n He plays Skyrim?\n\n07:15.720 --> 07:16.760\n He's a huge fan of Skyrim.\n\n07:16.760 --> 07:17.920\n He plays every.\n\n07:17.920 --> 07:22.440\n So what Bobby Lee loves to do is to grind,\n\n07:22.440 --> 07:25.640\n do the boring task over and over, gather mushrooms.\n\n07:25.640 --> 07:27.580\n Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons,\n\n07:27.580 --> 07:29.540\n you can fight all kinds of things,\n\n07:29.540 --> 07:31.920\n but you can also gather mushrooms and different ingredients\n\n07:31.920 --> 07:34.000\n to make potions and all that kind of stuff.\n\n07:34.000 --> 07:35.160\n He loves the ingredients.\n\n07:35.160 --> 07:37.700\n He's the, you know, in the hunter gatherer world,\n\n07:37.700 --> 07:38.540\n he's the gatherer.\n\n07:38.540 --> 07:39.720\n He's the gatherer.\n\n07:39.720 --> 07:42.400\n Yeah, I've heard him described that way\n\n07:42.400 --> 07:44.520\n and he likes to describe himself that way.\n\n07:44.520 --> 07:46.600\n I worked with Bobby not too long ago.\n\n07:46.600 --> 07:49.200\n He came and did a couple days on this thing we were shooting\n\n07:49.200 --> 07:52.280\n and I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal.\n\n07:52.280 --> 07:54.260\n And if you know anything about Bobby Lee,\n\n07:54.260 --> 07:56.160\n you'd probably be able to predict that he spent\n\n07:56.160 --> 07:59.600\n that entire time playing farming on his iPad.\n\n07:59.600 --> 08:03.080\n Well, humans are a source of anxiety and trouble,\n\n08:03.080 --> 08:05.400\n so sometimes it's good to escape human interaction\n\n08:05.400 --> 08:06.280\n through video games.\n\n08:06.280 --> 08:07.120\n Totally.\n\n08:07.120 --> 08:07.960\n I'm with him on that.\n\n08:07.960 --> 08:11.120\n He's one of the funniest people ever.\n\n08:11.120 --> 08:11.960\n Totally.\n\n08:11.960 --> 08:14.560\n What do you think makes him funny?\n\n08:14.560 --> 08:16.880\n It's just all the times you've worked with him,\n\n08:16.880 --> 08:21.480\n the nonstandard, nonsecular way of his being.\n\n08:22.280 --> 08:26.880\n Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people,\n\n08:26.880 --> 08:29.800\n raw performers who lets it all hang out\n\n08:29.800 --> 08:31.680\n to the degree that he will even get naked\n\n08:31.680 --> 08:32.720\n in front of his audience,\n\n08:32.720 --> 08:35.600\n which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup.\n\n08:35.600 --> 08:38.520\n I'm bearing all, I'm showing you everything,\n\n08:38.520 --> 08:40.920\n and Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants.\n\n08:40.920 --> 08:43.200\n Yeah, I don't think he understands metaphor too much.\n\n08:43.200 --> 08:44.480\n He embodies metaphor.\n\n08:44.480 --> 08:46.120\n Yes, he embodies metaphor.\n\n08:46.120 --> 08:49.240\n He's the gatherer, we call him the gathering metaphor.\n\n08:49.240 --> 08:50.720\n Bobby the gatherer metaphor.\n\n08:50.720 --> 08:52.520\n He's a metaphor for something else,\n\n08:52.520 --> 08:53.920\n for somebody else's life.\n\n08:53.920 --> 08:56.200\n Someday he'll be in the dictionary\n\n08:57.320 --> 08:58.800\n representing some kind of concept,\n\n08:58.800 --> 09:00.120\n maybe the metaphor itself.\n\n09:00.120 --> 09:02.480\n Yeah, once this whole thing falls apart\n\n09:02.480 --> 09:04.800\n and we are climbing the kudzu vines\n\n09:04.800 --> 09:06.240\n that spiral up the Sears Tower,\n\n09:06.240 --> 09:07.760\n like they say in Fight Club,\n\n09:07.760 --> 09:09.920\n Bobby will go back to his gatherer form\n\n09:09.920 --> 09:12.080\n and be happy as a pig in shit,\n\n09:12.080 --> 09:13.480\n just walking around in a loincloth\n\n09:13.480 --> 09:14.840\n with his bird hanging out,\n\n09:14.840 --> 09:17.080\n tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them\n\n09:17.080 --> 09:19.400\n for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.\n\n09:19.400 --> 09:22.080\n I'd love to dig into something he did.\n\n09:22.080 --> 09:24.520\n You guys did a lot of great podcasts together.\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:28.440\n He asked you in a very uncomfortable process\n\n09:28.440 --> 09:29.840\n of why you don't do standup.\n\n09:29.840 --> 09:33.480\n So let me ask you, do you hate money?\n\n09:33.480 --> 09:36.560\n Well, I'm originally from Canada, yeah.\n\n09:36.560 --> 09:40.880\n So yeah, I'm a fricking pinko socialist.\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:42.760\n Is that where you come from?\n\n09:42.760 --> 09:44.520\n That's not a nice thing to say.\n\n09:44.520 --> 09:46.480\n I thought the Soviet Union,\n\n09:46.480 --> 09:47.920\n that is a nice thing to say.\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:52.920\n Like comrade, he's a good socialist with red,\n\n09:56.240 --> 09:58.280\n like some bold colors, yeah.\n\n09:58.280 --> 10:00.320\n There was an interesting tension in your voice\n\n10:00.320 --> 10:01.400\n and the way you talked about it.\n\n10:01.400 --> 10:04.200\n There's just not a source of happiness for you.\n\n10:04.200 --> 10:05.320\n You respect the art form,\n\n10:05.320 --> 10:08.600\n but it was not something that you were connected to,\n\n10:08.600 --> 10:09.600\n you felt connected to.\n\n10:09.600 --> 10:10.520\n That's a good way to put it.\n\n10:10.520 --> 10:14.080\n Yeah, I respect the art form a lot.\n\n10:14.080 --> 10:16.160\n And I grew up with all the albums and stuff.\n\n10:16.160 --> 10:18.520\n I had an older brother and sister who,\n\n10:18.520 --> 10:23.520\n so we had George Carlin, we had Richard Pryor,\n\n10:23.680 --> 10:26.800\n we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda Live,\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:30.160\n the Gilda Radner concert, we had all sorts of stuff.\n\n10:30.160 --> 10:33.840\n But I don't know, there's a lot of reasons.\n\n10:33.840 --> 10:36.320\n I do feel like a career in show business\n\n10:37.280 --> 10:41.720\n is it never goes the way you plan, like most things.\n\n10:41.720 --> 10:44.000\n And I was fortunate enough to get started\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:47.200\n outside of my native Vancouver or in my native Vancouver.\n\n10:47.200 --> 10:48.600\n I grew up in the burbs outside\n\n10:48.600 --> 10:50.600\n and there was a lot of industry there.\n\n10:50.600 --> 10:53.480\n So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor\n\n10:53.480 --> 10:54.720\n when I was like 16.\n\n10:54.720 --> 10:59.720\n So yeah, there were some times early on\n\n10:59.720 --> 11:03.240\n where I came up with some standup stuff and did it,\n\n11:03.240 --> 11:06.080\n but yeah, I quickly abandoned it.\n\n11:06.080 --> 11:09.760\n And then you go through, you do Mad TV and stuff,\n\n11:09.760 --> 11:13.200\n and that's where my, and this is gonna sound weird.\n\n11:13.200 --> 11:16.200\n Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby's podcast\n\n11:16.200 --> 11:18.240\n trying to avoid his questions?\n\n11:18.240 --> 11:20.320\n Well, he was giving you this face this whole time\n\n11:20.320 --> 11:24.320\n that was making the whole just atmosphere feel\n\n11:24.320 --> 11:25.160\n full of anxiety.\n\n11:25.160 --> 11:26.960\n So I'm trying not to give you a face.\n\n11:26.960 --> 11:28.880\n The whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool.\n\n11:28.880 --> 11:30.200\n Yeah, okay.\n\n11:30.200 --> 11:31.040\n Play cool, Lex.\n\n11:31.040 --> 11:31.880\n Play cool.\n\n11:31.880 --> 11:33.320\n You said it out loud a couple of times.\n\n11:33.320 --> 11:34.160\n I did.\n\n11:34.160 --> 11:35.000\n Just, you know, you cut that out.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:35.840\n Play cool.\n\n11:35.840 --> 11:36.680\n Play cool, dude.\n\n11:36.680 --> 11:37.500\n Cut out, cut it out.\n\n11:37.500 --> 11:38.340\n Maintain, bro.\n\n11:38.340 --> 11:39.180\n Here's what I'll say.\n\n11:39.180 --> 11:40.000\n There's two ways to do it.\n\n11:40.000 --> 11:42.040\n I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing\n\n11:42.040 --> 11:46.120\n for a while goes and starts doing standup out of nowhere.\n\n11:46.120 --> 11:49.520\n Cause I think it's an art form that's under attack\n\n11:49.520 --> 11:51.760\n because it's not like anything else.\n\n11:51.760 --> 11:55.120\n You need, although now you can of course,\n\n11:55.120 --> 11:56.480\n you know, make whatever you want.\n\n11:56.480 --> 11:59.680\n It's the era of self publishing as far as making a product\n\n11:59.680 --> 12:01.960\n and putting it out there, which is getting easier,\n\n12:01.960 --> 12:03.720\n of course, and I can't wait to talk to you about that\n\n12:03.720 --> 12:06.300\n with AI and how it's changing art.\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:12.480\n But in standup, all you need is a microphone\n\n12:12.480 --> 12:14.760\n and you know, perhaps it'd be good\n\n12:14.760 --> 12:16.240\n to have some mental illness\n\n12:16.240 --> 12:20.200\n and then you can just run up there and talk forever.\n\n12:20.200 --> 12:22.920\n And I say this to, you know, comedians.\n\n12:22.920 --> 12:25.260\n It's like, you guys have to deal with just\n\n12:25.260 --> 12:29.700\n an influx of people who aren't sure\n\n12:29.700 --> 12:30.960\n why they're doing comedy.\n\n12:30.960 --> 12:33.640\n I would ask comedians, I mean, not good ones,\n\n12:33.640 --> 12:34.720\n good ones, you know what they're doing,\n\n12:34.720 --> 12:36.040\n but everyone else like, what are you doing?\n\n12:36.040 --> 12:38.040\n Why, why are you doing standup?\n\n12:38.040 --> 12:40.320\n Having said that, I am allergic to money.\n\n12:40.320 --> 12:42.520\n Yeah, do you think they have a good answer for that?\n\n12:42.520 --> 12:43.360\n Why are they doing it?\n\n12:43.360 --> 12:45.040\n Cause I actually like when I'm in Austin,\n\n12:45.040 --> 12:47.600\n I like going to open mics, just listening.\n\n12:47.600 --> 12:52.480\n It's inspiring to me, both the funny and the unfunny people\n\n12:52.480 --> 12:55.040\n because they've been doing it for several years.\n\n12:55.040 --> 12:58.080\n Sometimes over a decade and they're still at it.\n\n12:58.080 --> 12:58.960\n They're still right there.\n\n12:58.960 --> 13:02.200\n There's going for the punch and then especially open mics\n\n13:02.200 --> 13:05.840\n that are really sad in that there's, you know,\n\n13:05.840 --> 13:07.960\n only like five other people in the audience\n\n13:07.960 --> 13:10.000\n and they're usually just other comedians\n\n13:10.000 --> 13:12.000\n and they're still going all out\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.000\n as if they're in front of a stadium.\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.720\n But that to me sounds like someone who loves it.\n\n13:16.720 --> 13:17.560\n Yeah.\n\n13:17.560 --> 13:19.240\n I got no questions for that person.\n\n13:19.240 --> 13:21.880\n I got questions for someone who goes sideways\n\n13:21.880 --> 13:24.700\n from here I'm recognizable doing something\n\n13:24.700 --> 13:28.040\n and then I'm doing standup because it's like,\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:30.280\n and truly look, I've been fortunate enough\n\n13:30.280 --> 13:31.520\n to be in the business for a long time\n\n13:31.520 --> 13:33.280\n and at this point, if I came up,\n\n13:33.280 --> 13:35.400\n I mean, doing live stuff is fun.\n\n13:35.400 --> 13:37.960\n I have friends that are like, you know,\n\n13:37.960 --> 13:40.440\n some guys who are primarily sketch people\n\n13:40.440 --> 13:42.000\n or you would look at them as sketch people\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.000\n and they can sell tickets for being sketch people\n\n13:44.000 --> 13:45.560\n and they, and we'll talk about it.\n\n13:45.560 --> 13:47.760\n And they're like, you know, I do a monologue\n\n13:47.760 --> 13:50.360\n and I do a little standup, then I do a song,\n\n13:50.360 --> 13:52.840\n then I do another monologue, then I play off the audience,\n\n13:52.840 --> 13:57.360\n do a little standup, but standup is,\n\n13:57.360 --> 14:00.040\n it's almost like playing music in that,\n\n14:01.360 --> 14:03.120\n you know, people are going up there playing music,\n\n14:03.120 --> 14:04.520\n but what band have you been listening to?\n\n14:04.520 --> 14:06.380\n That's what you're gonna sound like.\n\n14:06.380 --> 14:08.480\n So it's really, I mean, of course,\n\n14:08.480 --> 14:10.520\n I'm speaking from zero experience,\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:12.800\n but I've heard it takes years, of course,\n\n14:12.800 --> 14:14.260\n to find your own voice.\n\n14:14.260 --> 14:16.240\n Standups that when they first go up,\n\n14:16.240 --> 14:19.880\n they're doing some sort of impersonation of so and so\n\n14:19.880 --> 14:23.240\n and so and so, and then you gotta pop this audience\n\n14:23.240 --> 14:25.660\n that's paying and you're gonna get run over\n\n14:25.660 --> 14:27.480\n by the next person who's coming up\n\n14:27.480 --> 14:29.820\n and it's hard to follow the last person\n\n14:29.820 --> 14:31.200\n who went up before you.\n\n14:31.200 --> 14:34.560\n And I mean, that is a really hard way to,\n\n14:34.560 --> 14:36.960\n it's a very, it's quite a gauntlet\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:38.640\n to be in to find your voice comedically.\n\n14:38.640 --> 14:40.840\n But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch?\n\n14:40.840 --> 14:42.880\n Where you still have to find your own voice\n\n14:42.880 --> 14:44.840\n with like all the impressions you do,\n\n14:44.840 --> 14:47.520\n they're just terrible, you know,\n\n14:47.520 --> 14:49.480\n there are different spins and different people,\n\n14:49.480 --> 14:52.520\n they're not like perfect impressions, right?\n\n14:52.520 --> 14:55.880\n So that's, I mean, that's a similar kind of challenge\n\n14:55.880 --> 14:57.800\n and journey as standup.\n\n14:57.800 --> 15:00.200\n You're just saying they're kind of distinct\n\n15:00.200 --> 15:02.720\n and you fell into this one and you fell in love with it,\n\n15:02.720 --> 15:05.820\n which is like what Mad TV kind of opened you up to.\n\n15:05.820 --> 15:08.440\n Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor.\n\n15:08.440 --> 15:11.120\n I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age,\n\n15:11.120 --> 15:12.400\n as far back as I can remember,\n\n15:12.400 --> 15:15.680\n and I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:17.400\n and comedic acting and so on.\n\n15:17.400 --> 15:18.320\n So comedic acting.\n\n15:18.320 --> 15:22.920\n Yeah, early on, my influences were a very predictable list\n\n15:22.920 --> 15:27.920\n of guys from SCTV, Early Saturday Night Live, Monty Python,\n\n15:29.940 --> 15:32.640\n all of those performers really influenced me.\n\n15:32.640 --> 15:36.640\n It was later that I saw people like Kevin Kline,\n\n15:36.640 --> 15:38.420\n who's an incredible actor.\n\n15:38.420 --> 15:41.160\n I vividly remember being like 12, 13,\n\n15:41.160 --> 15:44.480\n seeing him get an Academy Award for Fish Called Wanda.\n\n15:44.480 --> 15:47.260\n And it blew my mind, because I was like, he was hilarious.\n\n15:47.260 --> 15:50.400\n I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now.\n\n15:50.400 --> 15:52.720\n And he won an Academy Award.\n\n15:52.720 --> 15:57.720\n And at that point, I started thinking more about acting.\n\n15:58.080 --> 16:00.480\n And then I was, like I said, really fortunate\n\n16:00.480 --> 16:04.200\n to fall in with, I mean, I always wanted to do it\n\n16:04.200 --> 16:06.560\n and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid.\n\n16:06.560 --> 16:09.520\n And then I ended up getting represented.\n\n16:09.520 --> 16:11.780\n And then I ended up on a teen show.\n\n16:11.780 --> 16:14.620\n I was on, basically, the easiest way to pitch it\n\n16:14.620 --> 16:17.680\n is it's like a Canadian, my so called life\n\n16:17.680 --> 16:19.560\n with these kids and their lives and stuff.\n\n16:19.560 --> 16:23.560\n And I did that for like five years and I really love acting.\n\n16:23.560 --> 16:25.000\n I really, truly love acting.\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:30.000\n And I'm not someone who wants people to know my opinion.\n\n16:30.400 --> 16:33.240\n So that's another thing about standup.\n\n16:33.240 --> 16:36.040\n Like I love the illusion of what I get to do\n\n16:36.040 --> 16:40.940\n in entertainment and podcasting is great for that.\n\n16:40.940 --> 16:45.200\n But to stand up there and, I don't know, just for me,\n\n16:45.200 --> 16:47.840\n it's like it would have to all be fantasy.\n\n16:49.640 --> 16:53.120\n Yeah, so Nietzsche said that every profound spirit\n\n16:53.120 --> 16:54.200\n needs a mask.\n\n16:55.360 --> 16:57.480\n Like you said, you don't like to talk about,\n\n16:58.480 --> 17:01.160\n in your comedy, you don't like to talk about stuff\n\n17:01.160 --> 17:02.640\n that's personal to you.\n\n17:02.640 --> 17:03.660\n Yeah.\n\n17:03.660 --> 17:04.840\n What is that?\n\n17:04.840 --> 17:07.240\n If you were to psychoanalyze yourself,\n\n17:07.240 --> 17:10.080\n do you think it's just not something you find funny\n\n17:10.080 --> 17:15.080\n or are you running from something and it's not your fault?\n\n17:15.920 --> 17:16.760\n Will.\n\n17:16.760 --> 17:18.440\n It's not your fault, Will.\n\n17:18.440 --> 17:21.280\n Speaking of another really great comedic actor\n\n17:21.280 --> 17:23.480\n who's also a serious actor, Robin Williams.\n\n17:23.480 --> 17:25.360\n One of the best serious actors.\n\n17:25.360 --> 17:30.360\n I mean, and one of the funniest people of all time,\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:35.000\n but as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man,\n\n17:35.000 --> 17:37.420\n as a standup and a performer,\n\n17:37.420 --> 17:39.760\n I almost like his serious stuff better.\n\n17:39.760 --> 17:41.200\n Can I ask you a question about that?\n\n17:41.200 --> 17:43.480\n What do you make of the, that he committed suicide?\n\n17:43.480 --> 17:47.280\n I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing.\n\n17:47.280 --> 17:52.280\n I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of depression.\n\n17:52.520 --> 17:54.480\n It's almost like he died for others depression.\n\n17:54.480 --> 17:55.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n17:55.320 --> 17:56.160\n Like.\n\n17:56.160 --> 17:56.980\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n17:56.980 --> 17:58.180\n You'd look at someone like that and go,\n\n17:58.180 --> 17:59.160\n wait a minute, you're a rockstar.\n\n17:59.160 --> 18:01.480\n Like you don't, you could just check out\n\n18:01.480 --> 18:03.240\n if you're not liking your life.\n\n18:03.240 --> 18:05.680\n And of course, something like suicide\n\n18:05.680 --> 18:07.120\n begs that you look a little deeper\n\n18:07.120 --> 18:12.120\n and realize how tortured the human mind can make someone.\n\n18:12.960 --> 18:16.040\n Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA.\n\n18:16.040 --> 18:18.960\n Is there some aspect of celebrity that is isolating\n\n18:18.960 --> 18:21.280\n that can make you feel really lonely?\n\n18:21.280 --> 18:22.120\n Not me.\n\n18:22.120 --> 18:24.160\n I don't feel, no, not really.\n\n18:24.160 --> 18:25.680\n You feel the love?\n\n18:25.680 --> 18:28.480\n No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like,\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:31.320\n I don't know, I've always kind of had a small group\n\n18:31.320 --> 18:34.240\n of friends and those people don't, you know,\n\n18:34.240 --> 18:37.040\n it's like I've known the same people for years and years.\n\n18:37.040 --> 18:38.760\n You never really felt the celebrity really.\n\n18:38.760 --> 18:42.000\n Nah, in LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people.\n\n18:42.000 --> 18:42.840\n Nobody cares.\n\n18:42.840 --> 18:45.840\n They see you and then the next minute they see so and so.\n\n18:45.840 --> 18:48.640\n So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that.\n\n18:50.760 --> 18:51.760\n Mike and Molly, right?\n\n18:51.760 --> 18:52.600\n Nope, nope.\n\n18:52.600 --> 18:53.440\n Close.\n\n18:53.440 --> 18:56.080\n King of, you shave your head, you go bald.\n\n18:56.080 --> 18:57.080\n Are you King of Queens?\n\n18:57.080 --> 18:58.820\n Nope, that's not me.\n\n18:58.820 --> 19:00.780\n So close.\n\n19:00.780 --> 19:03.280\n You're wow, shit, you used to be the mountain\n\n19:03.280 --> 19:04.720\n on Game of Thrones.\n\n19:04.720 --> 19:06.080\n You look like shit, what happened?\n\n19:06.080 --> 19:08.600\n You've been just eating fried dough?\n\n19:08.600 --> 19:09.440\n Yeah.\n\n19:09.440 --> 19:11.000\n Yeah, that's what's up.\n\n19:11.000 --> 19:12.400\n Can't lift any weights anymore.\n\n19:12.400 --> 19:16.120\n I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press.\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:18.100\n Ah, and people coming up to me.\n\n19:19.280 --> 19:21.000\n You used to be a dragon killer, dude.\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.920\n Half the man you used to be.\n\n19:22.920 --> 19:25.840\n What's, have there been low points in your life?\n\n19:25.840 --> 19:27.340\n Sorry to go there, but.\n\n19:28.980 --> 19:30.220\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n19:30.220 --> 19:31.720\n Hey, hey, hey.\n\n19:31.720 --> 19:32.560\n Eh?\n\n19:32.560 --> 19:33.380\n Eh?\n\n19:33.380 --> 19:34.220\n Eh?\n\n19:34.220 --> 19:38.560\n Yeah, there's, everybody has a low point in life.\n\n19:38.560 --> 19:39.400\n The operative.\n\n19:39.400 --> 19:40.280\n Do you suffer from like depression\n\n19:40.280 --> 19:41.120\n and any of those kinds of things?\n\n19:41.120 --> 19:42.200\n You know what, I do.\n\n19:42.200 --> 19:44.760\n I do, I have a bunch of stuff.\n\n19:45.800 --> 19:46.760\n How do you deal with it?\n\n19:46.760 --> 19:47.880\n Said friends?\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:48.700\n The friends and the.\n\n19:48.700 --> 19:51.240\n They don't do anything for me in that sense.\n\n19:51.240 --> 19:52.080\n Yeah.\n\n19:52.080 --> 19:55.040\n I have an incredible fiance who,\n\n19:55.040 --> 19:58.300\n that's nice to have somebody constant\n\n19:58.300 --> 20:01.080\n that you love very much and see as the best person\n\n20:01.080 --> 20:02.480\n and all that good stuff.\n\n20:02.480 --> 20:04.240\n Hopefully, vice versa.\n\n20:04.240 --> 20:05.080\n And then.\n\n20:05.080 --> 20:06.800\n Well, on your recent Instagram,\n\n20:06.800 --> 20:09.520\n she said that she loves you, so.\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:10.360\n Wow, you were.\n\n20:10.360 --> 20:11.200\n At least allegedly.\n\n20:11.200 --> 20:12.100\n Just on, yeah, allegedly.\n\n20:12.100 --> 20:13.640\n That might all be for, yeah.\n\n20:13.640 --> 20:14.480\n That's all.\n\n20:14.480 --> 20:15.680\n How much money did you pay her to say that?\n\n20:15.680 --> 20:18.160\n I don't have any, because I'm not a stand up.\n\n20:18.160 --> 20:20.820\n I was like, I can do, you got Venmo?\n\n20:20.820 --> 20:21.660\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n20:21.660 --> 20:23.080\n I got, I only have like $123.\n\n20:23.080 --> 20:24.320\n I can give you some Dogecoin.\n\n20:24.320 --> 20:25.320\n Yeah, some Doge.\n\n20:25.320 --> 20:26.160\n Yeah.\n\n20:26.160 --> 20:27.840\n You got, you want some Doge?\n\n20:27.840 --> 20:30.340\n I got some of those monkey NFTs.\n\n20:30.340 --> 20:31.380\n Oh, before I forget.\n\n20:31.380 --> 20:32.360\n Yes.\n\n20:32.360 --> 20:33.720\n Hold on a second.\n\n20:33.720 --> 20:35.280\n Oh, no.\n\n20:35.280 --> 20:38.000\n Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone if that's okay.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:38.840\n Sure.\n\n20:39.800 --> 20:40.800\n Here.\n\n20:40.800 --> 20:41.640\n Oh, yeah.\n\n20:41.640 --> 20:42.460\n Now, these are tricky,\n\n20:42.460 --> 20:44.000\n because I have the thumbs of a,\n\n20:44.000 --> 20:45.240\n I have like Italian sausage thumbs.\n\n20:45.240 --> 20:46.840\n Don't wait and watch this happen.\n\n20:46.840 --> 20:48.080\n I'm just gonna.\n\n20:48.080 --> 20:49.600\n This will take another.\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:51.800\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n20:51.800 --> 20:52.640\n Oh, man.\n\n20:52.640 --> 20:53.800\n Yeah, ooh, this is embarrassing.\n\n20:53.800 --> 20:57.000\n When this, are you good under pressure?\n\n20:57.000 --> 20:57.840\n Sure.\n\n20:57.840 --> 20:58.660\n I have anxiety.\n\n20:58.660 --> 20:59.760\n I have performance anxiety.\n\n20:59.760 --> 21:01.000\n Do you have anxiety?\n\n21:01.000 --> 21:01.840\n Yeah.\n\n21:01.840 --> 21:02.660\n You have anxiety, period?\n\n21:02.660 --> 21:03.500\n Period.\n\n21:03.500 --> 21:04.340\n Yeah.\n\n21:04.340 --> 21:05.160\n I, I.\n\n21:05.160 --> 21:06.000\n Like, I don't like it when I,\n\n21:06.000 --> 21:09.040\n if I have to pee and then everyone's waiting\n\n21:09.040 --> 21:10.080\n in the urinals.\n\n21:10.080 --> 21:10.900\n Yeah.\n\n21:10.900 --> 21:11.740\n Yeah.\n\n21:11.740 --> 21:12.560\n I don't like it.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:13.400\n You know what'll help you in that situation?\n\n21:13.400 --> 21:14.240\n What's that?\n\n21:14.240 --> 21:15.120\n Taking a shit.\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:16.840\n Because whenever you take a shit,\n\n21:16.840 --> 21:18.120\n you always pee a little.\n\n21:18.120 --> 21:20.800\n It's hard to take a shit while you're standing at a urinal,\n\n21:20.800 --> 21:21.620\n but.\n\n21:21.620 --> 21:22.840\n Not in my world.\n\n21:22.840 --> 21:23.680\n Okay.\n\n21:23.680 --> 21:24.520\n You just gotta keep yourself full of things\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:25.440\n that make you shit.\n\n21:25.440 --> 21:26.280\n Oh, good.\n\n21:26.280 --> 21:28.020\n Have you ever heard of a banana?\n\n21:28.020 --> 21:29.120\n I did recently.\n\n21:29.120 --> 21:29.960\n Somebody told me about it.\n\n21:29.960 --> 21:30.780\n Yeah.\n\n21:30.780 --> 21:31.720\n Not the showbiz term.\n\n21:31.720 --> 21:33.160\n I'm talking about the food.\n\n21:33.160 --> 21:34.000\n There you go.\n\n21:34.000 --> 21:34.820\n Oh.\n\n21:34.820 --> 21:35.660\n There we go.\n\n21:35.660 --> 21:38.120\n Here you go.\n\n21:38.120 --> 21:38.940\n Which way is up?\n\n21:38.940 --> 21:39.780\n It's this way, right?\n\n21:39.780 --> 21:40.600\n It's like a D.\n\n21:40.600 --> 21:41.440\n No, to spin it.\n\n21:41.440 --> 21:42.280\n There you go.\n\n21:42.280 --> 21:43.100\n There you go.\n\n21:43.100 --> 21:43.940\n All right.\n\n21:46.160 --> 21:47.120\n So sexy.\n\n21:48.480 --> 21:50.080\n You're like a brand.\n\n21:50.080 --> 21:50.900\n Yeah.\n\n21:50.900 --> 21:51.940\n It's very important to brand yourself.\n\n21:51.940 --> 21:52.780\n These colors.\n\n21:52.780 --> 21:54.160\n Are you selling shoes?\n\n21:55.120 --> 21:55.960\n Yeah.\n\n21:55.960 --> 21:57.940\n I got some custom kicks coming out.\n\n21:57.940 --> 21:59.120\n The dudesy.\n\n21:59.120 --> 21:59.940\n No.\n\n21:59.940 --> 22:01.880\n Actually, that would be a good idea.\n\n22:01.880 --> 22:03.880\n You could probably sell a pair or two of those.\n\n22:03.880 --> 22:04.840\n Speaking of anxiety,\n\n22:04.840 --> 22:07.560\n I really am only focused on this right now, Alex.\n\n22:07.560 --> 22:08.380\n I apologize.\n\n22:08.380 --> 22:09.400\n Just shit your pants.\n\n22:09.400 --> 22:10.720\n It'll make it easier.\n\n22:10.720 --> 22:12.080\n Get on with it.\n\n22:12.080 --> 22:14.400\n Oh, this thing has been dog eared in my pocket for a while.\n\n22:14.400 --> 22:16.220\n I swear this never happens to me.\n\n22:16.220 --> 22:17.060\n I'm sorry, babe.\n\n22:17.060 --> 22:18.920\n People don't thumb at a sticker for an hour\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:19.760\n while they're doing the podcast?\n\n22:19.760 --> 22:20.980\n No, this is just an excuse you make\n\n22:20.980 --> 22:23.480\n when you're with somebody and you're underperforming.\n\n22:23.480 --> 22:25.060\n Well, here's the thing.\n\n22:25.060 --> 22:27.600\n As you ask me questions that I don't wanna answer,\n\n22:27.600 --> 22:28.440\n I'll just go to this.\n\n22:28.440 --> 22:29.320\n Go to the sticker.\n\n22:29.320 --> 22:32.080\n So if this ends up working,\n\n22:32.080 --> 22:32.920\n then I won't have it as a club.\n\n22:32.920 --> 22:34.200\n It's funny how you started doing that\n\n22:34.200 --> 22:35.460\n when we were talking about depression.\n\n22:35.460 --> 22:36.300\n That's weird.\n\n22:36.300 --> 22:37.120\n That is weird.\n\n22:38.120 --> 22:40.080\n Tell me how that makes you feel.\n\n22:42.800 --> 22:43.640\n Here we are.\n\n22:43.640 --> 22:44.480\n We got it.\n\n22:44.480 --> 22:47.480\n For the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes.\n\n22:47.480 --> 22:48.320\n Yeah.\n\n22:48.320 --> 22:49.140\n You know what?\n\n22:49.140 --> 22:51.000\n No, I do have some of that stuff.\n\n22:51.000 --> 22:56.000\n Bobby Lee had encouraged me on wax, as I like to say,\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:59.660\n to talk about it on podcasts, to talk about depression,\n\n22:59.660 --> 23:01.220\n because it could help people.\n\n23:01.220 --> 23:02.540\n And I said, no.\n\n23:02.540 --> 23:06.140\n But it's true, I do have some.\n\n23:06.140 --> 23:07.940\n There's some history in the family.\n\n23:07.940 --> 23:09.420\n How do you overcome it?\n\n23:09.420 --> 23:12.660\n Well, I used to not believe in medication at all.\n\n23:12.660 --> 23:15.060\n I used to think that that was for someone else\n\n23:15.060 --> 23:20.060\n who's been diagnosed with some of the rougher stuff.\n\n23:20.860 --> 23:24.380\n But as I got older and some of the stuff happens,\n\n23:24.380 --> 23:29.380\n and you have to, and by stuff, I mean mental stuff.\n\n23:30.380 --> 23:33.380\n And yeah, so I went and I just,\n\n23:33.380 --> 23:36.620\n I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely.\n\n23:36.620 --> 23:37.620\n 5%.\n\n23:37.620 --> 23:41.620\n And so I do therapy, I do talk therapy.\n\n23:41.620 --> 23:45.620\n I'm on a little bit of stuff, which, let me tell you,\n\n23:45.620 --> 23:50.620\n when I first started it, I was someone I'm close to.\n\n23:50.620 --> 23:55.620\n I was like, my manager, and she goes, this is too much.\n\n23:58.100 --> 24:00.280\n But she was like, hey, you don't have to white knuckle it\n\n24:00.280 --> 24:01.620\n through life, right?\n\n24:01.620 --> 24:04.820\n Because I was literally just like, everything became\n\n24:05.980 --> 24:09.020\n really hard to do at a level that I wanted to do it at,\n\n24:09.020 --> 24:11.720\n even just getting through your day, right?\n\n24:12.580 --> 24:17.580\n And when I first got some of the meds that I'm on,\n\n24:17.580 --> 24:21.420\n it felt like doors and windows were opening,\n\n24:21.420 --> 24:22.540\n literally in my brain.\n\n24:22.540 --> 24:26.780\n I took a three hour nap the first day,\n\n24:26.780 --> 24:29.460\n and you shouldn't even feel this stuff the first day.\n\n24:29.460 --> 24:31.500\n I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge.\n\n24:31.500 --> 24:33.640\n It wanted to, I needed some relief.\n\n24:33.640 --> 24:35.020\n And I'm not a nap guy.\n\n24:35.020 --> 24:37.060\n I can sleep three hours and I'll be fine.\n\n24:38.280 --> 24:43.100\n But I took a long nap and then it started to help.\n\n24:43.100 --> 24:46.260\n Yeah, isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry\n\n24:46.260 --> 24:50.060\n in your head can just make the whole world appear\n\n24:50.060 --> 24:51.540\n so much more beautiful?\n\n24:51.540 --> 24:56.540\n Yeah, yeah, I mean, after all, there's a lot going on\n\n24:56.580 --> 25:00.300\n in your brain that can be changed by your lifestyle,\n\n25:00.300 --> 25:03.880\n but also so many physical things, like a little bit of meds.\n\n25:03.880 --> 25:08.820\n Or in Bobby's case, thumbing around on some dumb farming app.\n\n25:09.700 --> 25:12.460\n Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods\n\n25:12.460 --> 25:15.860\n with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff.\n\n25:15.860 --> 25:16.700\n Totally.\n\n25:16.700 --> 25:18.820\n And just everything else involved.\n\n25:18.820 --> 25:21.020\n I mean, that's the beautiful rollercoaster of who he is,\n\n25:21.020 --> 25:23.820\n and a lot of great comedians seem to be that way.\n\n25:23.820 --> 25:25.700\n So I wonder what the connection there is.\n\n25:25.700 --> 25:29.100\n You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?\n\n25:29.100 --> 25:29.940\n Yeah.\n\n25:29.940 --> 25:31.300\n Like, at some point.\n\n25:31.300 --> 25:32.900\n Yes.\n\n25:32.900 --> 25:35.660\n On a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have?\n\n25:37.100 --> 25:39.780\n In some ways, a 10.\n\n25:39.780 --> 25:41.380\n And in other ways that I think,\n\n25:41.380 --> 25:44.980\n in other ways, sort of functionally,\n\n25:44.980 --> 25:46.940\n I'm like a two or a three,\n\n25:46.940 --> 25:49.980\n because, I don't know, I'm from Canada,\n\n25:49.980 --> 25:54.220\n and I try to just keep things very even keeled.\n\n25:54.220 --> 25:57.140\n My parents are Italian, they're from Italy,\n\n25:57.140 --> 26:00.140\n and they grew up during World War II,\n\n26:00.140 --> 26:04.300\n and they're very simple outlook on things.\n\n26:04.300 --> 26:08.380\n They're complex, incredible, classy people\n\n26:08.380 --> 26:12.940\n who are very simple when it comes to a lot of stuff.\n\n26:12.940 --> 26:16.100\n And I think just being a sort of,\n\n26:16.940 --> 26:19.140\n at heart, kind of a timid Canadian,\n\n26:19.140 --> 26:22.380\n coming out here years ago as a kid,\n\n26:23.340 --> 26:28.340\n it was all I could do to just keep everything super normal.\n\n26:28.740 --> 26:32.380\n And then I sort of was able to settle into that\n\n26:32.380 --> 26:33.740\n as a lifestyle.\n\n26:33.740 --> 26:37.060\n But you love the idea of being an actor.\n\n26:37.060 --> 26:39.060\n Who, you mentioned John Candy\n\n26:39.060 --> 26:42.580\n in Planes and Automobiles.\n\n26:42.580 --> 26:44.980\n It's one of my favorite movies, he says, one of yours.\n\n26:44.980 --> 26:47.660\n What do you think that makes that movie work?\n\n26:47.660 --> 26:52.060\n What do you, what, and when you talk about\n\n26:52.060 --> 26:54.940\n enjoying that movie, do you enjoy just the raw comedy,\n\n26:54.940 --> 26:58.980\n or do you enjoy the friendship and the love that's there,\n\n26:58.980 --> 27:03.340\n even though on the surface, it doesn't make any sense\n\n27:03.340 --> 27:05.500\n that there should be a friendship there?\n\n27:05.500 --> 27:08.220\n I mean, that's such an important element to that film.\n\n27:08.220 --> 27:11.460\n But as a kid, I just loved the comedy.\n\n27:11.460 --> 27:14.660\n And then it's been a nostalgic favorite of mine.\n\n27:14.660 --> 27:15.900\n It's my favorite movie.\n\n27:16.780 --> 27:19.940\n But it's also, it's just legit my favorite movie\n\n27:19.940 --> 27:22.820\n because as you get older and you start watching it,\n\n27:22.820 --> 27:26.500\n you realize it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker\n\n27:26.500 --> 27:29.620\n and what John Candy, particularly,\n\n27:29.620 --> 27:32.300\n and but also Steve Martin are doing in the film\n\n27:32.300 --> 27:33.820\n that makes it such a work of art,\n\n27:33.820 --> 27:38.820\n which is loneliness is there in every moment of that film.\n\n27:40.100 --> 27:44.580\n And John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith,\n\n27:44.580 --> 27:46.740\n his character in the film.\n\n27:46.740 --> 27:49.860\n Del Griffith is a lonely guy and John Candy,\n\n27:49.860 --> 27:52.420\n but Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy\n\n27:52.420 --> 27:53.980\n and a shower curtain ring salesman\n\n27:53.980 --> 27:56.220\n and knows everybody in the Midwest\n\n27:56.220 --> 27:59.540\n and runs around to motels and has meaningful conversations\n\n27:59.540 --> 28:04.300\n with the guy, even in Gus, whoever he's talking to.\n\n28:04.300 --> 28:07.140\n But there's loneliness there all the time.\n\n28:07.140 --> 28:10.460\n And this is a character,\n\n28:10.460 --> 28:12.540\n the film is filled with loneliness\n\n28:12.540 --> 28:15.460\n and it's not until the second last scene\n\n28:15.460 --> 28:16.940\n when he's at the train station,\n\n28:18.020 --> 28:20.420\n Del, what are you doing here?\n\n28:20.420 --> 28:23.540\n I thought you were going home, what are you doing here?\n\n28:23.540 --> 28:26.940\n That's a very good Neil Page from the movie.\n\n28:26.940 --> 28:27.780\n Thank you.\n\n28:27.780 --> 28:30.220\n That's when you realize how lonely he is.\n\n28:30.220 --> 28:32.460\n A lot of applause and post cheers.\n\n28:32.460 --> 28:33.900\n That's when you realize how lonely he is\n\n28:33.900 --> 28:36.860\n and I think that's the element from the film that,\n\n28:36.860 --> 28:39.740\n I mean, look, nowadays, I feel like,\n\n28:39.740 --> 28:40.980\n I've been saying this for a long time,\n\n28:40.980 --> 28:43.780\n but John Candy would have won an Academy Award\n\n28:43.780 --> 28:45.820\n hands down for that film.\n\n28:45.820 --> 28:48.460\n It's just they didn't do that with comedies back then.\n\n28:48.460 --> 28:49.300\n Yeah.\n\n28:49.300 --> 28:50.260\n Until the year after that movie came out\n\n28:50.260 --> 28:51.440\n with Fish Called Wanda.\n\n28:51.440 --> 28:53.980\n Yeah, and then it's, I mean, still comedies\n\n28:53.980 --> 28:55.540\n don't get respected enough.\n\n28:55.540 --> 28:59.020\n Robin Williams, I guess he got an Oscar for\n\n28:59.020 --> 29:00.680\n Good Will Hunting.\n\n29:02.060 --> 29:04.340\n Jim Carrey, did he ever get an Oscar?\n\n29:04.340 --> 29:06.080\n I don't know, I don't believe so.\n\n29:06.080 --> 29:09.020\n Yeah, they don't get, you don't,\n\n29:09.020 --> 29:10.300\n but that's not even, if he did,\n\n29:10.300 --> 29:12.500\n you wouldn't be for comedies.\n\n29:12.500 --> 29:14.580\n It's just, I mean, there's some things\n\n29:14.580 --> 29:18.580\n that are plain, strange, and odd.\n\n29:18.580 --> 29:20.980\n Would you even put that as a, I guess it's a comedy.\n\n29:20.980 --> 29:21.820\n Yeah, I mean.\n\n29:21.820 --> 29:24.220\n But there is a loneliness and depth\n\n29:24.220 --> 29:25.740\n that permeates the whole movie.\n\n29:25.740 --> 29:26.580\n Yeah.\n\n29:26.580 --> 29:28.200\n That ultimately, and it's a happy ending,\n\n29:28.200 --> 29:30.300\n which is hard to kinda.\n\n29:30.300 --> 29:32.440\n It's a happy ending only because\n\n29:32.440 --> 29:35.180\n in the last moment of the movie,\n\n29:35.180 --> 29:38.260\n John Candy puts on a brave face,\n\n29:39.980 --> 29:43.280\n even when he's got no one.\n\n29:43.280 --> 29:44.120\n No.\n\n29:44.120 --> 29:46.600\n And he's there seeing Neil Page's entire family\n\n29:46.600 --> 29:49.520\n on Thanksgiving, and he forces a smile,\n\n29:49.520 --> 29:52.420\n which is the last, literally the last frame of the movie.\n\n29:52.420 --> 29:54.340\n And I've said before, if you're not reduced\n\n29:54.340 --> 29:58.720\n to just a sobbing pile of meat at the end of the movie,\n\n29:58.720 --> 29:59.860\n then you are not human.\n\n30:01.140 --> 30:04.340\n Yeah, it is a happy ending.\n\n30:04.340 --> 30:08.060\n It's a happy ending, even though it's a sad,\n\n30:08.060 --> 30:10.660\n sad character. So much loneliness in the world.\n\n30:10.660 --> 30:12.540\n I was just in Vegas.\n\n30:12.540 --> 30:15.860\n I went to a diner at like 4 a.m., 5 a.m.,\n\n30:15.860 --> 30:17.940\n and there was a waitress who was empty.\n\n30:17.940 --> 30:21.220\n As a waitress, I was the sweetest, kindest human being.\n\n30:21.220 --> 30:24.140\n Kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff.\n\n30:24.140 --> 30:25.720\n Hun.\n\n30:25.720 --> 30:28.020\n And then after I ate, she said,\n\n30:28.020 --> 30:30.060\n Don, just talk to me a little bit.\n\n30:30.060 --> 30:31.780\n You know, it was cause there was nobody there,\n\n30:31.780 --> 30:35.060\n and it was just so much sadness in her eyes.\n\n30:35.060 --> 30:35.900\n I don't know.\n\n30:35.900 --> 30:38.820\n But it's also so much love, like that sweetheart.\n\n30:38.820 --> 30:43.780\n It reminded me kind of of the John Candy performance,\n\n30:43.780 --> 30:51.660\n because at first, because I was reading a pretty dark book\n\n30:51.660 --> 30:54.860\n about Hitler, so I was a little bit frustrated\n\n30:54.860 --> 30:56.660\n that she kept talking to me,\n\n30:56.660 --> 31:01.080\n because it was almost like the same way that John Candy is.\n\n31:01.080 --> 31:02.720\n It's annoying a little bit, right?\n\n31:02.720 --> 31:04.840\n But then very quickly, I opened up to like,\n\n31:04.840 --> 31:07.700\n well, there's a kind human being,\n\n31:07.700 --> 31:10.180\n and there's like that human connection superseded\n\n31:10.180 --> 31:12.140\n everything else, and I don't know, it was just beautiful.\n\n31:12.140 --> 31:16.420\n And I think John Candy captures that really well,\n\n31:16.420 --> 31:19.620\n which is like, the connection with other human beings,\n\n31:19.620 --> 31:22.660\n sometimes we pull away from that,\n\n31:22.660 --> 31:27.660\n because we have a busy life full of stuff to do,\n\n31:27.820 --> 31:31.020\n as Steve Martin's character kind of characterizes.\n\n31:31.020 --> 31:33.420\n He's like a marketing exec or something like that.\n\n31:33.420 --> 31:36.940\n But if you just pause and notice others,\n\n31:36.940 --> 31:39.860\n you can really discover beautiful people.\n\n31:39.860 --> 31:44.020\n Totally, totally, everyone's got their story.\n\n31:44.020 --> 31:50.620\n And you know, Candy as a person, I've never met the man,\n\n31:50.620 --> 31:53.940\n but he's the kind of guy that, you know,\n\n31:53.940 --> 31:56.580\n he could just walk up to, back in the day,\n\n31:56.580 --> 31:59.020\n I would imagine he could walk up to just about any house,\n\n31:59.020 --> 32:01.220\n at least in Canada, knock on the door,\n\n32:01.220 --> 32:04.140\n and you'd invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean?\n\n32:04.140 --> 32:11.460\n So yeah, as you're talking about putting a book down\n\n32:11.460 --> 32:12.820\n and talking to someone for a while,\n\n32:12.820 --> 32:15.140\n even though you'd really like to read your book,\n\n32:15.140 --> 32:19.220\n it's that sort of thing that Candy's character in the movie\n\n32:19.220 --> 32:22.420\n sort of does that, like Johnny Appleseed.\n\n32:22.420 --> 32:25.940\n You realize he's just going around making people smile,\n\n32:25.940 --> 32:29.140\n you know, and Neil Page is hanging with this guy,\n\n32:29.140 --> 32:33.620\n so frustrated, he's so exhausting in his big underwear\n\n32:33.620 --> 32:35.900\n in the sink at the hotel and everything,\n\n32:35.900 --> 32:39.420\n and by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know?\n\n32:39.420 --> 32:43.220\n So it's a good and a bad thing that you didn't take\n\n32:43.220 --> 32:47.220\n that waitress with you on a trip, maybe road trip up to Reno.\n\n32:47.220 --> 32:50.460\n Oh, oh, she's actually, she's out shopping right now.\n\n32:50.460 --> 32:54.500\n We've been having sex multiple times a day ever since.\n\n32:54.500 --> 32:56.500\n Oh, that's nice, that's lovely, how cute.\n\n32:56.500 --> 32:59.020\n I'm sure she's married and happily\n\n32:59.020 --> 33:02.780\n and has many grandchildren, okay.\n\n33:02.780 --> 33:06.100\n And plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think, right?\n\n33:06.100 --> 33:06.940\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n33:06.940 --> 33:09.380\n Thanksgiving, so Thanksgiving just embodies\n\n33:09.380 --> 33:14.380\n that forget about the busyness and whatever the career\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:17.080\n you're chasing in life and just take a pause\n\n33:17.080 --> 33:17.920\n and appreciate the people you love in life.\n\n33:17.920 --> 33:19.740\n Just be with your family, yeah.\n\n33:19.740 --> 33:21.700\n Or the people, whatever your family looks like.\n\n33:21.700 --> 33:23.340\n Friends, yeah.\n\n33:23.340 --> 33:26.820\n You have some weird friends, unorthodox friends.\n\n33:26.820 --> 33:29.700\n So at least in the public sphere.\n\n33:29.700 --> 33:30.540\n Oh, yeah.\n\n33:30.540 --> 33:33.380\n From Bobby Lee, Brian Callan, all those kinds of folks\n\n33:33.380 --> 33:36.220\n from the Mad TV days, I'm sure there's others.\n\n33:36.220 --> 33:38.260\n What does it mean to be a good friend?\n\n33:38.260 --> 33:39.560\n Here in LA?\n\n33:39.560 --> 33:40.840\n Or just in general?\n\n33:40.840 --> 33:41.680\n In the world.\n\n33:41.680 --> 33:42.500\n In the world.\n\n33:42.500 --> 33:43.340\n Is LA something different?\n\n33:43.340 --> 33:44.320\n Is LA a world friend?\n\n33:44.320 --> 33:46.380\n I think it is different here, I think it is.\n\n33:46.380 --> 33:47.220\n I think people are.\n\n33:47.220 --> 33:48.180\n I think there's a little bit of a career\n\n33:48.180 --> 33:51.520\n kind of negotiation shuffling around, that kind of stuff.\n\n33:51.520 --> 33:52.900\n Why is it different?\n\n33:52.900 --> 33:56.620\n Oh, I just mean, I mean, I mean that it's just\n\n33:56.620 --> 34:01.620\n kind of hard here to make time, everybody.\n\n34:02.740 --> 34:04.600\n It's always been a city to me that is like,\n\n34:04.600 --> 34:06.140\n we'll keep you so busy.\n\n34:06.140 --> 34:08.220\n And every time I go home to Vancouver,\n\n34:08.220 --> 34:11.180\n after a few days, I start to get a little stir crazy.\n\n34:11.180 --> 34:15.140\n And I think that being here in LA,\n\n34:15.140 --> 34:16.500\n I go to sleep with a hundred things\n\n34:16.500 --> 34:17.900\n that I still have to do.\n\n34:17.900 --> 34:20.460\n And you're never out of stuff to do.\n\n34:20.460 --> 34:25.420\n And if you, when you ask about are you nuts or whatever,\n\n34:25.420 --> 34:27.580\n if you're crazy, I mean, look, every,\n\n34:27.580 --> 34:30.540\n all the weirdest people from every high school\n\n34:30.540 --> 34:31.380\n in the United States is like,\n\n34:31.380 --> 34:33.740\n yo, I'm gonna make it in LA, you know.\n\n34:33.740 --> 34:35.380\n Everyone just comes here.\n\n34:35.380 --> 34:38.860\n And just another freak in the freak kingdom,\n\n34:38.860 -->

Williams as Johnny Depp\n\n34:46.140 --> 34:47.820\n as Hunter S. Thompson.\n\n34:47.820 --> 34:49.540\n It's not your fault, Will.\n\n34:49.540 --> 34:50.380\n It's pretty good.\n\n34:50.380 --> 34:51.200\n Thank you.\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:52.940\n Could have been you, Fear and Loathing.\n\n34:52.940 --> 34:53.780\n In Fear and Loathing?\n\n34:53.780 --> 34:54.660\n Yeah, it'd be interesting.\n\n34:54.660 --> 34:56.260\n I would have liked to play his attorney,\n\n34:56.260 --> 35:00.500\n the role that Benicia del Toro gained weight for.\n\n35:00.500 --> 35:01.540\n That would have been cool.\n\n35:01.540 --> 35:04.580\n He's just saying, what's up over the line?\n\n35:04.580 --> 35:05.900\n Like that, chewing his face off.\n\n35:05.900 --> 35:07.100\n I could have done that.\n\n35:09.900 --> 35:11.260\n Yeah, no, I think that it's.\n\n35:11.260 --> 35:12.300\n Backdoor beauty.\n\n35:12.300 --> 35:14.540\n That guy's full of good lines.\n\n35:14.540 --> 35:15.740\n Yeah, I flip you.\n\n35:15.740 --> 35:16.900\n I flip you for real.\n\n35:18.220 --> 35:19.140\n He's a good actor.\n\n35:19.140 --> 35:20.620\n Yeah, fantastic actor.\n\n35:20.620 --> 35:22.980\n I think what it takes to be a good friend\n\n35:22.980 --> 35:26.460\n is just presence, just being there.\n\n35:26.460 --> 35:29.740\n I mean, that's all anyone needs to be heard, right?\n\n35:29.740 --> 35:32.460\n In LA, it is interesting.\n\n35:33.500 --> 35:37.020\n I haven't seen people that I love in years.\n\n35:37.020 --> 35:37.860\n Some people.\n\n35:37.860 --> 35:38.680\n Just busy.\n\n35:38.680 --> 35:39.520\n Yeah, just busy.\n\n35:39.520 --> 35:40.900\n Can you still have a depth of connection\n\n35:40.900 --> 35:44.380\n even though, like one of the reasons\n\n35:44.380 --> 35:45.660\n I really enjoy doing a podcast,\n\n35:45.660 --> 35:49.420\n you get to sit down with actual friends of yours\n\n35:49.420 --> 35:51.460\n and spend prolonged periods of time together\n\n35:51.460 --> 35:52.900\n that you don't otherwise.\n\n35:52.900 --> 35:53.740\n That's a good point.\n\n35:53.740 --> 35:56.780\n I've spoken on this podcast to people really close to me\n\n35:56.780 --> 35:59.160\n and it's like you've never had a conversation\n\n35:59.160 --> 36:01.460\n without microphones like you do with microphones.\n\n36:01.460 --> 36:05.300\n It's weird, but there's some aspect about LA\n\n36:05.300 --> 36:07.660\n that a lot of the, especially friends of yours,\n\n36:07.660 --> 36:10.620\n comedians and so on, they'll do podcasts and stuff\n\n36:10.620 --> 36:13.220\n and there's, I don't know, there's an intimacy to that.\n\n36:13.220 --> 36:15.140\n Yeah, there is and there isn't.\n\n36:15.140 --> 36:18.340\n The ones that I do, I mean, I just did\n\n36:18.340 --> 36:20.020\n Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's.\n\n36:20.020 --> 36:21.980\n Funny enough, called Bad Friends.\n\n36:21.980 --> 36:23.220\n Bad Friends.\n\n36:23.220 --> 36:26.780\n And afterwards, and my good pal, Chad Colchin,\n\n36:26.780 --> 36:29.900\n with whom I do dudesy, was with me.\n\n36:29.900 --> 36:31.420\n Sneakers are coming soon.\n\n36:31.420 --> 36:32.580\n Sneakers are coming soon.\n\n36:32.580 --> 36:34.420\n You get your Will Foot and your Chad Foot.\n\n36:34.420 --> 36:36.760\n Comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half.\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:40.380\n And I remember afterwards we were talking,\n\n36:40.380 --> 36:43.940\n it was just basically me, Chad, and Santino were talking\n\n36:43.940 --> 36:46.940\n and Bobby was over there on his phone\n\n36:46.940 --> 36:50.940\n and then I was like, I mean, we didn't spend any time\n\n36:50.940 --> 36:53.020\n talking about anything.\n\n36:53.020 --> 36:56.060\n It feels like one of those hours that goes by\n\n36:56.060 --> 36:57.760\n and you realize, I've just been goofing around\n\n36:57.760 --> 36:58.600\n with these guys, which is.\n\n36:58.600 --> 36:59.780\n But that's what life is about, right?\n\n36:59.780 --> 37:00.600\n It's fine. A little bit.\n\n37:00.600 --> 37:01.440\n It's great.\n\n37:01.440 --> 37:02.420\n And then I'm like, all right, Bobby.\n\n37:02.420 --> 37:03.940\n Hey, Bob, I'll see you later.\n\n37:03.940 --> 37:06.560\n And he's like, like this.\n\n37:06.560 --> 37:07.400\n All right, man.\n\n37:07.400 --> 37:08.220\n Hey, love you, bro.\n\n37:08.220 --> 37:09.060\n See you later.\n\n37:09.060 --> 37:10.460\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n37:10.460 --> 37:11.620\n He's a guy, do you ever just,\n\n37:11.620 --> 37:15.380\n I just send text messages over there to him\n\n37:15.380 --> 37:17.060\n that never come back.\n\n37:17.060 --> 37:19.640\n And then he thinks that I'm angry with him\n\n37:19.640 --> 37:22.380\n because it'll go two, three years\n\n37:22.380 --> 37:24.180\n without him getting back to me.\n\n37:24.180 --> 37:26.740\n And then just out of nowhere, hey, fuck face.\n\n37:26.740 --> 37:27.860\n And.\n\n37:27.860 --> 37:28.900\n Who says, hey, fuck face?\n\n37:28.900 --> 37:29.740\n He does or you do?\n\n37:29.740 --> 37:30.560\n Yeah, he does.\n\n37:30.560 --> 37:31.400\n Or you both talk to each other?\n\n37:31.400 --> 37:33.500\n No, I gotta be very careful with Bobby.\n\n37:33.500 --> 37:35.260\n Yeah, I gotta be very sweet.\n\n37:35.260 --> 37:36.220\n Dear friend.\n\n37:36.220 --> 37:37.060\n Dear friend, hello.\n\n37:37.060 --> 37:37.940\n How are you doing?\n\n37:37.940 --> 37:38.780\n How are you?\n\n37:38.780 --> 37:42.140\n I know I checked in with you, but not but three months ago.\n\n37:43.180 --> 37:45.100\n And then every once in a while, he'll go, hey, fuck face.\n\n37:45.100 --> 37:46.700\n I tend to hide from the world\n\n37:46.700 --> 37:51.060\n and I can be pretty shitty with friends to go back, yeah.\n\n37:51.060 --> 37:53.500\n I can empathize with Bobby.\n\n37:53.500 --> 37:54.920\n Might be a Skyrim thing.\n\n37:56.060 --> 37:58.220\n It might be like hiding in a world,\n\n37:58.220 --> 38:01.380\n in a digital world with fake NPCs.\n\n38:01.380 --> 38:03.260\n Yeah, yeah, there's that.\n\n38:05.180 --> 38:06.200\n Yeah, you know, I have a buddy\n\n38:06.200 --> 38:09.980\n who said something really smart a while ago.\n\n38:09.980 --> 38:13.440\n We ended up working together on this TV show thing\n\n38:13.440 --> 38:15.260\n and I reached out to him to see\n\n38:15.260 --> 38:16.340\n if he wanted to do it with us.\n\n38:16.340 --> 38:20.140\n And he did and he goes, this is a great guy,\n\n38:20.140 --> 38:21.820\n such a funny writer.\n\n38:21.820 --> 38:23.740\n He goes, I may not be in touch all the time,\n\n38:23.740 --> 38:25.340\n but I know who my friends are.\n\n38:25.340 --> 38:26.180\n You know what I mean?\n\n38:26.180 --> 38:28.060\n And it's like in our business,\n\n38:28.060 --> 38:30.420\n and this is a fellow who moved,\n\n38:30.420 --> 38:33.980\n who's from Ontario, Canada, moved back there.\n\n38:33.980 --> 38:37.020\n He's on the farm with his wife and kids and he does not care.\n\n38:37.020 --> 38:38.820\n He's never been a Hollywood guy.\n\n38:38.820 --> 38:41.540\n And it's tough to get hold of him.\n\n38:41.540 --> 38:44.940\n But when you do, you know, he's still the same sweet old guy.\n\n38:44.940 --> 38:46.340\n He's doing his thing though.\n\n38:46.340 --> 38:47.820\n Yeah, yeah, some of my closest friends,\n\n38:47.820 --> 38:50.220\n even if we don't talk for a few months,\n\n38:50.220 --> 38:51.700\n we'll write back at it if we do.\n\n38:51.700 --> 38:52.920\n And then if shit goes,\n\n38:52.920 --> 38:54.960\n like if something really traumatic happens\n\n38:54.960 --> 38:56.860\n or difficult stuff or, you know,\n\n38:56.860 --> 38:58.740\n any of that kind of stuff, I'm always there.\n\n38:58.740 --> 39:01.220\n So like, so for important stuff,\n\n39:01.220 --> 39:04.420\n for important highs and important lows, you're there.\n\n39:04.420 --> 39:05.780\n And then you pick right back up,\n\n39:05.780 --> 39:09.100\n especially if you have those years of experiences together.\n\n39:09.100 --> 39:09.940\n It's interesting.\n\n39:09.940 --> 39:11.060\n Totally.\n\n39:11.060 --> 39:13.080\n So you've done a couple of podcasts.\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:13.920\n Yeah.\n\n39:13.920 --> 39:16.540\n So we've got to talk about Doodsy a little bit,\n\n39:16.540 --> 39:19.100\n but first you did for several years,\n\n39:19.100 --> 39:20.500\n you did the 10 minute podcast.\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:21.340\n Yeah.\n\n39:22.900 --> 39:24.860\n I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast,\n\n39:24.860 --> 39:27.000\n including the fact that it's 10 minutes.\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:27.840\n Right.\n\n39:27.840 --> 39:29.100\n I mean, it's ridiculous.\n\n39:29.100 --> 39:30.580\n It's absurd.\n\n39:30.580 --> 39:31.940\n The dynamic is hilarious.\n\n39:31.940 --> 39:34.660\n It's you, Brian Callan, Crystalia there.\n\n39:34.660 --> 39:38.260\n I don't know exactly why it works so well,\n\n39:38.260 --> 39:39.660\n but it did, it worked really well.\n\n39:39.660 --> 39:41.960\n I think it's because the, yeah,\n\n39:41.960 --> 39:43.340\n you were having fun probably.\n\n39:43.340 --> 39:46.940\n I mean, that's what really came through.\n\n39:46.940 --> 39:49.420\n That it was friends just talking shit\n\n39:49.420 --> 39:51.420\n and the tension, the beautiful tension\n\n39:51.420 --> 39:53.140\n and the absurdity that came out.\n\n39:53.140 --> 39:54.380\n Yeah.\n\n39:54.380 --> 39:55.860\n Sure.\n\n39:55.860 --> 39:57.900\n What was the story of making that podcast?\n\n39:57.900 --> 39:59.580\n How did that came to be?\n\n39:59.580 --> 40:01.940\n Why do you think it was as good as it was?\n\n40:01.940 --> 40:02.780\n I don't know.\n\n40:02.780 --> 40:04.920\n I feel like that podcast was like,\n\n40:04.920 --> 40:09.520\n it was who we kind of are,\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:11.980\n but on steroids or something.\n\n40:11.980 --> 40:14.820\n Like, you know, each person, you know,\n\n40:14.820 --> 40:17.340\n Brian's going to be like extra manly and...\n\n40:19.060 --> 40:21.300\n Can you get any more manly than he already is?\n\n40:21.300 --> 40:22.820\n No, yeah, no.\n\n40:22.820 --> 40:23.920\n He reaches though.\n\n40:24.820 --> 40:26.460\n And yeah, we just kind of,\n\n40:26.460 --> 40:31.140\n I feel like as goofballs, we knew each other's line.\n\n40:31.140 --> 40:33.260\n Like here's the line you don't cross.\n\n40:33.260 --> 40:35.580\n I feel like those guys don't really have one,\n\n40:35.580 --> 40:36.920\n but at least they knew mine.\n\n40:37.820 --> 40:41.900\n And yeah, we were able to just goof around.\n\n40:41.900 --> 40:45.460\n And I did it with them for three years.\n\n40:45.460 --> 40:48.220\n And then Chad, who I'm doing dudesy with\n\n40:48.220 --> 40:49.940\n and my pal, Tommy Blacho,\n\n40:49.940 --> 40:53.740\n who's another writer producer like Chad, they came on.\n\n40:53.740 --> 40:58.740\n And yeah, all told, I did like seven years of that thing.\n\n40:58.780 --> 41:00.800\n Six, five, six, seven, I don't remember.\n\n41:02.780 --> 41:06.140\n Do you think it ever comes back in some small form\n\n41:06.140 --> 41:08.580\n as a 20 minute podcast or something like that?\n\n41:08.580 --> 41:12.460\n I mean, is there, because it's one of the most requested,\n\n41:12.460 --> 41:15.140\n I mean, you have a huge fan base.\n\n41:15.140 --> 41:16.700\n I'm 47 years old.\n\n41:16.700 --> 41:21.220\n So I am of the generation that had a cell phone,\n\n41:21.220 --> 41:23.820\n has had a cell phone half the time\n\n41:23.820 --> 41:26.380\n and didn't for the formative years of my life\n\n41:26.380 --> 41:28.080\n into my early 20s.\n\n41:29.780 --> 41:31.940\n And then finally I got a cell phone,\n\n41:31.940 --> 41:33.420\n I guess I was like 19 or something,\n\n41:33.420 --> 41:35.180\n like literally just because I'm moving to LA.\n\n41:35.180 --> 41:37.060\n You got porn in the mail.\n\n41:37.060 --> 41:37.900\n Yes, that's right.\n\n41:37.900 --> 41:40.140\n It was the hard cover porn.\n\n41:40.140 --> 41:42.100\n That's the way we liked it.\n\n41:42.100 --> 41:46.780\n Bound, nice binding on the porn, leather.\n\n41:46.780 --> 41:48.100\n Next to the Bible, yeah.\n\n41:48.100 --> 41:52.540\n Yep, these are all my, these are my Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n41:52.540 --> 41:53.780\n Wow, very impressive.\n\n41:53.780 --> 41:56.060\n Yes, a man came to the house and sold me these.\n\n41:56.060 --> 42:00.020\n And then down here, these are my, this is my pornography.\n\n42:00.020 --> 42:04.580\n If you'll follow me through here to the parlor, sir.\n\n42:04.580 --> 42:06.020\n It's passed through the generations\n\n42:06.020 --> 42:08.220\n from grandfather to father, yeah.\n\n42:08.220 --> 42:10.180\n I wanna give you something very special to me,\n\n42:10.180 --> 42:12.400\n Nebuchadnezzar, but.\n\n42:14.220 --> 42:15.780\n So you go up in the generation without a cell phone.\n\n42:15.780 --> 42:19.180\n Yes, it's hard for me to connect with people\n\n42:19.180 --> 42:22.000\n who hit me up.\n\n42:22.000 --> 42:23.660\n I look at everything as polling.\n\n42:23.660 --> 42:26.500\n So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion,\n\n42:26.500 --> 42:29.140\n but two other people hit me up and share that,\n\n42:29.140 --> 42:32.100\n I'm the worst, I don't follow my polls.\n\n42:32.100 --> 42:35.640\n When people say, oh, that poll means absolutely nothing.\n\n42:35.640 --> 42:38.860\n So and so is gonna win anyway, that's my poll.\n\n42:38.860 --> 42:39.880\n My poll means nothing.\n\n42:39.880 --> 42:41.780\n But I do look at the stuff and go,\n\n42:42.660 --> 42:44.340\n this many people are saying this,\n\n42:44.340 --> 42:47.280\n that means that that number is saying that.\n\n42:47.280 --> 42:51.300\n And yet it's very hard for me to hear\n\n42:51.300 --> 42:53.660\n what the hell people are saying online.\n\n42:53.660 --> 42:56.740\n I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally.\n\n42:56.740 --> 42:59.860\n So when you say that that's a popular podcast,\n\n42:59.860 --> 43:02.540\n like I know that it's popular with the people\n\n43:02.540 --> 43:04.500\n that have expressed that they love it.\n\n43:04.500 --> 43:05.340\n Yeah. You know what I mean?\n\n43:05.340 --> 43:07.060\n What does that actually represent?\n\n43:07.060 --> 43:07.900\n I don't know.\n\n43:07.900 --> 43:09.740\n I don't know what kind of people are the audience.\n\n43:09.740 --> 43:10.580\n I don't know.\n\n43:10.580 --> 43:13.020\n I know that the people that listen to the 10 Minute Podcast\n\n43:13.020 --> 43:16.500\n and if you did, thank you, and we're friends.\n\n43:17.860 --> 43:19.900\n I know that it was a special thing\n\n43:19.900 --> 43:21.940\n because it's like, just doing this out of my house\n\n43:21.940 --> 43:24.020\n and we just built it up out of nowhere\n\n43:24.020 --> 43:26.140\n and we're just kind of clowning around.\n\n43:26.140 --> 43:27.560\n It's an odd thing.\n\n43:27.560 --> 43:31.940\n I hope, I personally, I think I speak for the two people\n\n43:31.940 --> 43:34.020\n that have reached out to you that said you should do it\n\n43:34.020 --> 43:35.220\n or whatever, three people.\n\n43:35.220 --> 43:38.380\n The poll that you should bring it back at some point.\n\n43:38.380 --> 43:39.220\n That would be beautiful.\n\n43:39.220 --> 43:43.900\n Just maybe, it's like, what's a good story\n\n43:43.900 --> 43:46.660\n of like a famous band that came back and was successful?\n\n43:46.660 --> 43:47.500\n Probably, well.\n\n43:47.500 --> 43:48.320\n Nirvana?\n\n43:48.320 --> 43:49.940\n No, it was not.\n\n43:49.940 --> 43:51.460\n It wasn't Nirvana.\n\n43:51.460 --> 43:54.220\n Sorry, I got Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith.\n\n43:54.220 --> 43:55.060\n Yeah. It was Aerosmith.\n\n43:55.060 --> 43:55.900\n It was Aerosmith.\n\n43:55.900 --> 43:56.740\n It was not Nirvana.\n\n43:56.740 --> 43:57.980\n Yeah, they had that second ride.\n\n43:57.980 --> 43:58.820\n Different.\n\n43:58.820 --> 44:01.700\n Yeah, totally different ending of those two bands.\n\n44:01.700 --> 44:04.760\n One ended up on American Idol.\n\n44:04.760 --> 44:08.900\n Yeah, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too.\n\n44:08.900 --> 44:12.740\n All right, how did Doodze come to be?\n\n44:12.740 --> 44:13.580\n Doodze.\n\n44:13.580 --> 44:14.500\n And what the hell is Doodze?\n\n44:14.500 --> 44:16.300\n Doodze is the first podcast,\n\n44:16.300 --> 44:18.300\n and this is exciting that you've asked me\n\n44:18.300 --> 44:21.080\n to come here today because to hear\n\n44:21.080 --> 44:22.260\n what you would have to say about it\n\n44:22.260 --> 44:23.340\n or what you would ask about it.\n\n44:23.340 --> 44:27.000\n It is the first podcast that is run completely by\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:31.180\n and essentially, I like to say curated by an AI.\n\n44:32.140 --> 44:33.680\n We were approached by a company\n\n44:33.680 --> 44:35.780\n that had this proprietary AI that wants\n\n44:35.780 --> 44:38.220\n to develop the podcast into the future\n\n44:38.220 --> 44:40.720\n and figure out exactly what it takes\n\n44:40.720 --> 44:42.840\n to make the best podcast ever.\n\n44:42.840 --> 44:47.840\n And it was all we knew from the top\n\n44:48.520 --> 44:50.240\n and what they really wanted was two people\n\n44:50.240 --> 44:54.120\n who were actually friends and could be meaningful\n\n44:54.120 --> 44:57.620\n in the podcast space based on whatever information they had.\n\n44:57.620 --> 45:00.740\n Is the company CIA and are they testing technology\n\n45:00.740 --> 45:03.140\n to control the populace through chatbots?\n\n45:03.140 --> 45:05.660\n I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to share that information.\n\n45:05.660 --> 45:07.980\n You are, yeah, who gave you the suit?\n\n45:07.980 --> 45:09.780\n Where did you get the suit?\n\n45:09.780 --> 45:10.980\n Where did you get the suit, Will?\n\n45:10.980 --> 45:11.820\n Yeah, well the C.\n\n45:11.820 --> 45:12.640\n J.C. Penney?\n\n45:12.640 --> 45:14.820\n CIA stands for something different in here.\n\n45:14.820 --> 45:15.820\n I mean, you know, it doesn't mean\n\n45:15.820 --> 45:17.940\n like the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n45:17.940 --> 45:18.780\n I'm probably, it's just.\n\n45:18.780 --> 45:21.820\n It's a different, it's Canadian.\n\n45:21.820 --> 45:24.260\n Canadian International Apparel.\n\n45:24.260 --> 45:27.260\n Yeah, the Canadian International Apparel Company hit us up,\n\n45:27.260 --> 45:28.100\n Chad and I.\n\n45:29.700 --> 45:31.460\n Well, Chad's a super weirdo.\n\n45:31.460 --> 45:32.940\n You would get a kick out of him, I know.\n\n45:32.940 --> 45:36.620\n You guys, you strike me as very similar in some ways.\n\n45:36.620 --> 45:37.620\n I'll take that as a compliment.\n\n45:37.620 --> 45:40.900\n It is, and it is, and it is.\n\n45:40.900 --> 45:42.900\n If I was friends with you for as long as I've been\n\n45:42.900 --> 45:44.800\n with Chad, perhaps I'd have some horrible shit\n\n45:44.800 --> 45:45.640\n to say about you.\n\n45:45.640 --> 45:48.740\n But the good parts, you remind me of him.\n\n45:48.740 --> 45:50.700\n And we were approached by this company\n\n45:50.700 --> 45:53.620\n that said we have this AI and we would like\n\n45:53.620 --> 45:55.700\n to set it loose on you.\n\n45:55.700 --> 45:58.580\n And essentially, we had to hand over some,\n\n45:58.580 --> 46:02.220\n some information that would allow the AI\n\n46:02.220 --> 46:06.980\n to access our email and look at our search histories,\n\n46:06.980 --> 46:08.980\n purchase histories, things like this,\n\n46:08.980 --> 46:10.980\n and really dig into.\n\n46:10.980 --> 46:12.820\n Pornhub included or not?\n\n46:12.820 --> 46:16.300\n Yeah, I had to hand over all my leather bound\n\n46:16.300 --> 46:18.040\n 1970s pornography.\n\n46:19.340 --> 46:22.860\n And essentially, it curates a podcast for us every week\n\n46:22.860 --> 46:25.860\n doing dumb things like, you know, it says,\n\n46:25.860 --> 46:29.860\n hey, Will, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation.\n\n46:29.860 --> 46:32.020\n Podcasts about news are very popular.\n\n46:32.020 --> 46:34.540\n This is infomania, you know what I mean?\n\n46:34.540 --> 46:35.940\n Oh, let me tell you something about that\n\n46:35.940 --> 46:37.220\n Marjorie Taylor Greene dude.\n\n46:37.220 --> 46:39.460\n And then he's going on doing some new stuff.\n\n46:40.460 --> 46:42.380\n And it basically just spits out all these things\n\n46:42.380 --> 46:45.900\n that it wants us to do, normally four segments an episode.\n\n46:45.900 --> 46:47.060\n And that's pretty much it.\n\n46:47.060 --> 46:48.380\n So it generates what to do.\n\n46:48.380 --> 46:49.820\n It generates the premise.\n\n46:49.820 --> 46:53.520\n I mean, you've spoken a bit here and there.\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:54.540\n Like I said, I'm a huge fan.\n\n46:54.540 --> 46:55.540\n I don't even remember where.\n\n46:55.540 --> 46:59.180\n But like you talked about that you enjoy Doodsy\n\n46:59.180 --> 47:03.400\n because you feel almost like liberated to,\n\n47:04.260 --> 47:06.880\n because you're operating within the constraints\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:08.500\n of the premise it generates.\n\n47:08.500 --> 47:13.500\n So you're almost not, you're free to riff, essentially.\n\n47:14.340 --> 47:15.180\n Yeah.\n\n47:15.180 --> 47:18.260\n Like you don't need to do the job of like\n\n47:18.260 --> 47:19.820\n coming up with the weird.\n\n47:19.820 --> 47:21.740\n You can just, the weird is given to you\n\n47:21.740 --> 47:23.220\n and then you just run with it.\n\n47:23.220 --> 47:24.420\n That's a good way to say it.\n\n47:24.420 --> 47:26.260\n Because we're already weird, Chad and I.\n\n47:26.260 --> 47:29.540\n Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff.\n\n47:29.540 --> 47:31.700\n He's particularly interested in AI lately\n\n47:31.700 --> 47:32.900\n and its effect on art.\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:36.220\n He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows.\n\n47:36.220 --> 47:40.860\n And I'm primarily acting and trying to come up with stuff.\n\n47:40.860 --> 47:42.500\n Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good.\n\n47:42.500 --> 47:44.020\n The rest of it hasn't seen much success.\n\n47:44.020 --> 47:47.340\n Anyway, Nora's the stuff with Chad for that matter.\n\n47:47.340 --> 47:49.620\n But that's because of me.\n\n47:49.620 --> 47:51.460\n Sneakers, you never know.\n\n47:51.460 --> 47:53.100\n Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers.\n\n47:53.100 --> 47:54.180\n Only in two sizes.\n\n47:54.180 --> 47:55.300\n Yeah, only in two sizes.\n\n47:55.300 --> 47:57.900\n You're gonna be able to take the tongue.\n\n47:57.900 --> 48:00.460\n You can't take it out because it's actually stitched in.\n\n48:00.460 --> 48:01.300\n Yeah.\n\n48:01.300 --> 48:02.140\n It's pretty cool stuff.\n\n48:02.140 --> 48:03.940\n Velcro?\n\n48:03.940 --> 48:05.860\n Velcro or?\n\n48:05.860 --> 48:07.980\n Yeah, Velcro up the side.\n\n48:07.980 --> 48:10.980\n We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff.\n\n48:10.980 --> 48:12.780\n Yeah, we want things to look like\n\n48:12.780 --> 48:15.780\n this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there.\n\n48:15.780 --> 48:17.860\n So cutting it, so Nike's doing a bunch of research\n\n48:17.860 --> 48:20.300\n for running how to make a super light shoe\n\n48:20.300 --> 48:21.540\n that you can be efficient in\n\n48:21.540 --> 48:23.140\n and break all kinds of running records.\n\n48:23.140 --> 48:24.580\n So you're doing the same kind of stuff.\n\n48:24.580 --> 48:25.540\n We're doing the same kind of thing\n\n48:25.540 --> 48:26.620\n for the podcasting space.\n\n48:26.620 --> 48:27.900\n The best kind of shoes to sit around\n\n48:27.900 --> 48:29.620\n and talk to your pal in.\n\n48:30.700 --> 48:33.140\n But yeah, it's bizarre.\n\n48:33.140 --> 48:34.460\n And it also does some writing.\n\n48:34.460 --> 48:36.660\n Doodsy does come up with things,\n\n48:36.660 --> 48:40.740\n but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now.\n\n48:40.740 --> 48:41.700\n It's a little bit foggy.\n\n48:41.700 --> 48:44.540\n It's a little bit weird, but it is improving.\n\n48:44.540 --> 48:47.700\n It is learning about us and writing stuff\n\n48:47.700 --> 48:49.900\n when it makes me spit this and that,\n\n48:49.900 --> 48:53.380\n which we'll read, I've prepared these things\n\n48:53.380 --> 48:54.900\n for you to read.\n\n48:54.900 --> 48:57.540\n It's impossible not to get a kick out of it\n\n48:57.540 --> 48:59.220\n because Chad and I are, first of all,\n\n48:59.220 --> 49:01.700\n we're blown away that we're doing this.\n\n49:01.700 --> 49:04.620\n And second of all, some of the stuff is actually very funny.\n\n49:04.620 --> 49:06.420\n It makes weird names.\n\n49:06.420 --> 49:08.060\n Like I don't think it understands,\n\n49:10.140 --> 49:11.900\n it messes up some words and stuff,\n\n49:11.900 --> 49:13.220\n but that makes it even funnier.\n\n49:13.220 --> 49:17.980\n And then it sort of from the beginning started laying on,\n\n49:17.980 --> 49:19.900\n like it says astonishing all the time.\n\n49:19.900 --> 49:22.100\n Everything is astonishing.\n\n49:22.100 --> 49:23.860\n That's Doodsy's favorite word.\n\n49:24.740 --> 49:29.740\n But yeah, it's basically just a way to frame the podcast.\n\n49:30.100 --> 49:30.940\n You know what I mean?\n\n49:30.940 --> 49:34.740\n Because my thing is I don't wanna do this\n\n49:34.740 --> 49:36.660\n where I actually have to talk to someone.\n\n49:36.660 --> 49:41.660\n You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation.\n\n49:42.140 --> 49:45.020\n It seems like, is that really hard work for you?\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:45.860\n No, not at all.\n\n49:45.860 --> 49:47.380\n It's just that I don't like to bore people.\n\n49:47.380 --> 49:51.540\n And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value\n\n49:51.540 --> 49:56.540\n for what I am, you know, your value with regard\n\n49:56.540 --> 50:01.220\n to this project is obviously warrant, it's obviously.\n\n50:01.220 --> 50:02.620\n I'm waiting for the explanation\n\n50:02.620 --> 50:04.460\n for what the value is exactly.\n\n50:04.460 --> 50:05.580\n Two dudes in a suit.\n\n50:05.580 --> 50:07.820\n No, listen, yeah, two dudes in a suit.\n\n50:07.820 --> 50:10.020\n No, but I mean, you've got your audience\n\n50:10.020 --> 50:11.220\n and that's the end of that.\n\n50:11.220 --> 50:12.660\n People find value in it.\n\n50:12.660 --> 50:17.660\n For me, I do feel like it is important\n\n50:18.860 --> 50:23.860\n that if I'm gonna do something that is gonna be funny\n\n50:24.700 --> 50:28.380\n or that I hope is funny, I just kinda wanna get in\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:32.100\n and out of someone's day and just kinda,\n\n50:32.100 --> 50:34.260\n I like making laughy.\n\n50:34.260 --> 50:36.260\n I want people to, you know, whatever.\n\n50:36.260 --> 50:38.140\n It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you.\n\n50:38.140 --> 50:40.340\n Yeah, but in the long form you feel the anxiety.\n\n50:40.340 --> 50:42.700\n You did a few funny things and I wonder\n\n50:42.700 --> 50:44.380\n if I can keep doing the funny thing.\n\n50:44.380 --> 50:45.220\n Is that why?\n\n50:45.220 --> 50:48.940\n You feel that, like why is Doodsy relieving you\n\n50:48.940 --> 50:50.140\n of some of the anxiety?\n\n50:52.060 --> 50:54.020\n Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety\n\n50:54.020 --> 50:56.300\n because I don't know what's coming.\n\n50:56.300 --> 51:01.300\n And that's weird for me because I like to prepare for things.\n\n51:01.380 --> 51:04.340\n But that's not what podcasting is.\n\n51:04.340 --> 51:07.020\n Podcasting, you need to just be malleable\n\n51:07.020 --> 51:09.120\n and say whatever and do whatever.\n\n51:09.120 --> 51:13.800\n And that's what makes it a real,\n\n51:13.800 --> 51:16.280\n I mean, look, it's a medium for conversation.\n\n51:16.280 --> 51:19.000\n And if you're driving along listening to this\n\n51:19.000 --> 51:23.800\n or anything else, it's the true meaning\n\n51:23.800 --> 51:25.040\n of the parasocial relationship\n\n51:25.040 --> 51:27.160\n because the best podcasts make you feel\n\n51:27.160 --> 51:29.040\n like you're sitting around rapping.\n\n51:29.040 --> 51:30.560\n We're just having a conversation.\n\n51:30.560 --> 51:32.080\n You could even be sitting there agreeing\n\n51:32.080 --> 51:34.320\n or talking out loud to yourself if you want.\n\n51:34.320 --> 51:35.480\n You could just be sitting in silence.\n\n51:35.480 --> 51:36.840\n Or you could just be sitting in silence\n\n51:36.840 --> 51:39.400\n in your fancy podcasting shoes,\n\n51:39.400 --> 51:40.960\n podcasting audience shoes.\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:43.840\n It's a very different build than those running shoes.\n\n51:43.840 --> 51:45.960\n Would they be also called Doodsy, the shoes?\n\n51:45.960 --> 51:47.920\n Yeah, they'll be Doodsy shoes.\n\n51:47.920 --> 51:49.560\n Doodsy shoes, that's very creative.\n\n51:49.560 --> 51:50.760\n Yeah.\n\n51:50.760 --> 51:54.160\n Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding.\n\n51:54.160 --> 51:55.760\n Everything is just Doodsy this and that.\n\n51:55.760 --> 51:58.040\n I would argue that's pretty good branding.\n\n51:58.040 --> 52:00.480\n Well, Doodsy allows me to just,\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:03.720\n it forces me to sit down with Chad\n\n52:03.720 --> 52:07.760\n and goof around for an hour or an hour plus.\n\n52:07.760 --> 52:12.760\n And it provides the parameters that I a lot of times ignore\n\n52:13.000 --> 52:16.320\n because I think that podcasting is just two dudes\n\n52:16.320 --> 52:18.360\n shitting around or three or four.\n\n52:18.360 --> 52:23.360\n But it sits me down and gives me a premise\n\n52:23.840 --> 52:25.480\n to work with communically.\n\n52:25.480 --> 52:26.320\n And then you just riff with it.\n\n52:26.320 --> 52:27.920\n Yeah, it's fun.\n\n52:27.920 --> 52:29.200\n It's been a hoot.\n\n52:29.200 --> 52:31.160\n So from the acting perspective,\n\n52:31.160 --> 52:34.160\n a lot of people like Daniel Day Lewis\n\n52:34.160 --> 52:36.880\n will see acting just like as you described,\n\n52:36.880 --> 52:39.000\n which is you have your roles,\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:40.840\n you embrace those roles, and then you disappear.\n\n52:40.840 --> 52:44.160\n You don't do podcasts.\n\n52:44.160 --> 52:45.920\n You don't do any of that kind of stuff.\n\n52:45.920 --> 52:47.600\n Your art is your art.\n\n52:47.600 --> 52:51.520\n So is that part of you feels that way?\n\n52:51.520 --> 52:53.200\n I think so.\n\n52:53.200 --> 52:54.360\n Is that the actor side of you?\n\n52:54.360 --> 52:55.320\n Yeah.\n\n52:55.320 --> 52:56.720\n Anytime I get to do something\n\n52:56.720 --> 53:00.000\n that I don't get a chance to do much of\n\n53:00.000 --> 53:03.080\n or something that people haven't seen me do much of\n\n53:03.080 --> 53:06.320\n or that I've done on some scale that hasn't been very wide\n\n53:06.320 --> 53:08.000\n and not a lot of people have seen it,\n\n53:08.000 --> 53:10.400\n that's the stuff that I get really excited about.\n\n53:12.200 --> 53:14.840\n I don't know why I'm,\n\n53:14.840 --> 53:17.440\n I don't know why necessarily.\n\n53:17.440 --> 53:19.120\n I haven't answered that question yet in my life,\n\n53:19.120 --> 53:22.920\n like what it is about being an actor that I love so much\n\n53:22.920 --> 53:25.280\n because it's not like I don't like to,\n\n53:25.280 --> 53:27.240\n it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself\n\n53:27.240 --> 53:30.000\n and play other characters and stuff and not be myself.\n\n53:31.520 --> 53:33.520\n But it is, it has always been fun\n\n53:33.520 --> 53:37.680\n to just be other people and escape.\n\n53:37.680 --> 53:39.720\n Yeah, is there some aspect to the impressions\n\n53:39.720 --> 53:42.880\n where you become that person?\n\n53:42.880 --> 53:45.960\n Is that like, what's that like to,\n\n53:45.960 --> 53:48.880\n I suppose acting is a full on version of that.\n\n53:48.880 --> 53:53.880\n You really at its best become the character.\n\n53:54.080 --> 53:55.800\n Is there some fun in that?\n\n53:55.800 --> 53:56.960\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n53:56.960 --> 53:59.120\n If you can play a character for long enough\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:05.720\n and then jump out of it, that's a lot of fun.\n\n54:05.720 --> 54:08.680\n Like I did this movie like four or five years ago\n\n54:08.680 --> 54:12.680\n called The Inside Game about the NBA gambling scandal\n\n54:12.680 --> 54:15.920\n that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now.\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:19.920\n And that character, I played Jimmy Batista,\n\n54:21.760 --> 54:26.600\n Baba the sheep, who's this guy who was this bookie\n\n54:26.600 --> 54:28.680\n and rah, rah, rah, and it's a very,\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:30.920\n he's, there's a lot going on with him.\n\n54:30.920 --> 54:34.440\n He's running numbers with the mob and stuff\n\n54:34.440 --> 54:36.680\n and there's a lot of money changing hands.\n\n54:36.680 --> 54:39.520\n That character was so, I got to be,\n\n54:39.520 --> 54:41.120\n get so deep into that character\n\n54:41.120 --> 54:43.800\n that coming out of it was a little odd.\n\n54:43.800 --> 54:45.360\n Or as weird as this sounds,\n\n54:46.480 --> 54:48.360\n the three stooges was hard for me to,\n\n54:48.360 --> 54:52.960\n I found that I had some of Curly's mannerisms\n\n54:52.960 --> 54:55.920\n just automatically, I could not stop them\n\n54:55.920 --> 54:58.240\n when people, when I would talk to people,\n\n54:58.240 --> 55:01.480\n they would come, I wasn't, I'm not doing it on purpose.\n\n55:01.480 --> 55:02.320\n I don't want to do that.\n\n55:02.320 --> 55:04.480\n Like I'm ready to shed it\n\n55:04.480 --> 55:07.040\n because I've been working on it\n\n55:07.040 --> 55:09.000\n for months and months at that point\n\n55:09.000 --> 55:10.560\n as far as getting the thing down\n\n55:10.560 --> 55:12.480\n and then you got to shoot.\n\n55:12.480 --> 55:14.480\n And then for me, it's always,\n\n55:14.480 --> 55:17.200\n I always want to change the stuff I did the day before.\n\n55:17.200 --> 55:18.280\n I'm like that.\n\n55:18.280 --> 55:19.680\n Or I'm like, I could have done it better\n\n55:19.680 --> 55:20.520\n and this and that.\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:22.360\n And that stayed with you,\n\n55:22.360 --> 55:23.560\n that character stayed with you a little bit.\n\n55:23.560 --> 55:24.600\n Totally, yeah.\n\n55:24.600 --> 55:27.000\n I just feel like with actors,\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.240\n sometimes when you listen to interviews,\n\n55:29.240 --> 55:31.760\n they have spent so much time\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:34.520\n sort of living inside other characters\n\n55:34.520 --> 55:37.600\n that they almost don't have a depth\n\n55:37.600 --> 55:40.400\n of personality themselves, like a depth.\n\n55:40.400 --> 55:42.120\n Like I don't mean that as a negative thing.\n\n55:42.120 --> 55:44.440\n It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best\n\n55:44.440 --> 55:46.760\n is pretending to be other people.\n\n55:46.760 --> 55:49.160\n And even pretending sounds negative,\n\n55:49.160 --> 55:52.280\n but like bringing certain characters to life.\n\n55:52.280 --> 55:55.040\n Yeah, yeah, embodying.\n\n55:55.040 --> 55:57.280\n A weird thing happened while we were doing Stooges\n\n55:57.280 --> 55:59.760\n because you've got a very heavy blueprint.\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:02.240\n We're following this very clear blueprint\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:04.920\n that the Stooges left for everybody.\n\n56:04.920 --> 56:07.720\n And for Stooge fans and people enjoying the movie,\n\n56:07.720 --> 56:08.720\n it's got to be this.\n\n56:08.720 --> 56:11.160\n You take your toolbox that you're used to bring\n\n56:11.160 --> 56:14.480\n into a comedy movie, you leave it behind.\n\n56:14.480 --> 56:16.560\n The only tools I'm bringing are the ones that he used.\n\n56:16.560 --> 56:18.360\n And a weird thing started happening\n\n56:18.360 --> 56:21.960\n where I would, I always saw the whole thing happening\n\n56:21.960 --> 56:24.600\n with the real Stooges in black and white.\n\n56:24.600 --> 56:26.440\n So if we're about to shoot a scene,\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:28.520\n I would just think about,\n\n56:28.520 --> 56:30.360\n I mean, aside from all the other preparation,\n\n56:30.360 --> 56:32.120\n you know everything and what you're supposed to do.\n\n56:32.120 --> 56:34.280\n And I've been watching so much of it.\n\n56:34.280 --> 56:36.840\n And the three of us are, we're pretty much left\n\n56:36.840 --> 56:40.560\n to come up with a lot of the striking combinations\n\n56:40.560 --> 56:42.280\n and all the stuff, which is all real smack\n\n56:42.280 --> 56:43.560\n and all this crap.\n\n56:43.560 --> 56:46.400\n And the stuff that we were doing that was very Stoogey,\n\n56:46.400 --> 56:48.080\n you're preparing all that stuff.\n\n56:48.080 --> 56:50.160\n But something else was happening before you jump\n\n56:50.160 --> 56:53.440\n into a scene and the unknown of now we're shooting it.\n\n56:53.440 --> 56:57.600\n And here are these parameters within to shoot the scene.\n\n56:57.600 --> 57:00.280\n I could still see it as them doing it.\n\n57:00.280 --> 57:02.960\n So much so that when I saw the movie at the premiere,\n\n57:02.960 --> 57:05.280\n I was like, who's this big fuck doing?\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:07.000\n Cause I'm not curly to me.\n\n57:07.000 --> 57:08.520\n Curly is curly.\n\n57:08.520 --> 57:09.360\n But I feel like.\n\n57:09.360 --> 57:11.240\n So you're seeing yourself in black and white almost.\n\n57:11.240 --> 57:12.880\n I was seeing him.\n\n57:12.880 --> 57:14.520\n Yeah, I was only seeing him.\n\n57:14.520 --> 57:16.560\n So channeling in some fundamental way.\n\n57:16.560 --> 57:19.160\n In some weird way, you're channeling him\n\n57:19.160 --> 57:21.160\n because you've seen so much of it.\n\n57:21.160 --> 57:25.160\n The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz\n\n57:25.160 --> 57:27.320\n is curly.\n\n57:27.320 --> 57:29.600\n I'm not saying he was exhumed or something\n\n57:29.600 --> 57:32.200\n or a spirit went in me or some weird,\n\n57:32.200 --> 57:33.400\n crystal mommy shit like that.\n\n57:33.400 --> 57:36.600\n I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it\n\n57:36.600 --> 57:39.920\n and because of the heavy blueprint that they left with you,\n\n57:39.920 --> 57:44.760\n you're channeling what that person does.\n\n57:44.760 --> 57:49.680\n And I was seeing entire scenes before you do them\n\n57:49.680 --> 57:51.000\n the way he would do it.\n\n57:51.000 --> 57:52.800\n And then you want a couple takes to make sure\n\n57:52.800 --> 57:54.520\n that you're doing it right.\n\n57:54.520 --> 57:57.760\n But that one was hard to let go of.\n\n57:57.760 --> 57:59.240\n Some of them are.\n\n57:59.240 --> 58:01.160\n Do you think Larry David, who was also in there\n\n58:01.160 --> 58:03.800\n dressed as a nun, also had trouble letting go of that?\n\n58:03.800 --> 58:06.440\n We mentioned clothes make the man think\n\n58:06.440 --> 58:08.000\n that worked for him in that case.\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:09.940\n Man, you know he.\n\n58:09.940 --> 58:11.300\n Was it like working with a guy?\n\n58:11.300 --> 58:13.120\n Come on, he's the greatest.\n\n58:13.120 --> 58:16.640\n And he's a big stooge, he's a stooge fan.\n\n58:16.640 --> 58:18.920\n And him and Pete Farrelly are good friends.\n\n58:18.920 --> 58:20.480\n But then Larry David has to show up\n\n58:20.480 --> 58:22.800\n and hang out with us for a couple weeks.\n\n58:22.800 --> 58:25.640\n He's like, I didn't realize it was gonna take this long.\n\n58:25.640 --> 58:29.800\n But shit, I gotta be out here in Atlanta, it's boiling hot.\n\n58:29.800 --> 58:32.160\n But at one point, there was this line\n\n58:32.160 --> 58:35.100\n where he kept doing, he would just spit a different line\n\n58:35.100 --> 58:37.080\n every time he was getting hit in the head with something\n\n58:37.080 --> 58:38.260\n and he's laying there on the ground.\n\n58:38.260 --> 58:41.200\n And he goes, he comes to and he says,\n\n58:41.200 --> 58:44.520\n at one point he goes, Miami audiences\n\n58:44.520 --> 58:47.720\n are the best audiences in the world, right?\n\n58:47.720 --> 58:48.640\n Because he's loopy.\n\n58:48.640 --> 58:53.560\n Now he's playing a nun at the orphanage\n\n58:53.560 --> 58:55.520\n where the three stooges grew up.\n\n58:55.520 --> 58:57.560\n And I'm super intimidated by Larry David,\n\n58:57.560 --> 58:58.760\n he's a genius and stuff.\n\n59:00.200 --> 59:03.180\n But I walk up to him and I go, so he's, what is he?\n\n59:03.180 --> 59:07.960\n Like a Borscht Belt Florida comedian who is on the lam?\n\n59:07.960 --> 59:09.480\n And so he's dressing as a woman,\n\n59:09.480 --> 59:12.520\n he ends up at an orphanage, like what's going on there?\n\n59:12.520 --> 59:15.880\n And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes, yeah.\n\n59:15.880 --> 59:20.800\n Like, I'm like, ah, he's got some like actor motivation.\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:25.480\n Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David in a nun's habit,\n\n59:25.480 --> 59:26.820\n which is hilarious.\n\n59:26.820 --> 59:31.120\n That's such a Pete Farrelly casting thing, it's, you know.\n\n59:31.120 --> 59:32.840\n And he, but he's doing this whole like,\n\n59:32.840 --> 59:35.640\n what a warm audience, you know, like, oh,\n\n59:35.640 --> 59:38.480\n he's like this Catskill comedian who's been living in,\n\n59:38.480 --> 59:40.400\n you know, both in return.\n\n59:40.400 --> 59:41.740\n Living through in his mind\n\n59:41.740 --> 59:43.300\n is just having fun with it, right?\n\n59:43.300 --> 59:46.640\n I mean, that and probably a combination of that\n\n59:46.640 --> 59:48.120\n and getting the lines right.\n\n59:48.120 --> 59:49.680\n Cause he's like, what are we doing here?\n\n59:49.680 --> 59:52.100\n What is, you know, just frustrated all day\n\n59:52.100 --> 59:53.720\n with what the heck we're trying to do.\n\n59:53.720 --> 59:54.560\n What do you think makes,\n\n59:54.560 --> 59:58.660\n I mean, that guy's one of the best improv people ever.\n\n59:58.660 --> 1:00:00.300\n So what do you think makes him so good?\n\n1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:04.160\n Like why is it so compelling to watch that guy?\n\n1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:05.440\n Because he's a comedic genius.\n\n1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:07.740\n Like he literally, he knows what he does.\n\n1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:10.360\n He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever.\n\n1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:13.520\n And he just happens to be that brilliant.\n\n1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.880\n I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do,\n\n1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:18.760\n I did just an episode of Curb, a small part,\n\n1:00:18.760 --> 1:00:21.400\n and it's crazy what he sees.\n\n1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.840\n I don't know what he sees.\n\n1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:26.760\n As a matter of fact, so I auditioned for it, for Curb,\n\n1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:28.680\n like, you know, two or three times, right?\n\n1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:29.960\n And never got anything.\n\n1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.880\n And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges\n\n1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:35.400\n that I got a call to do a bit part.\n\n1:00:35.400 --> 1:00:39.240\n But I remember auditioning, you go into that room\n\n1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:43.680\n and the guys waiting are all people that you know.\n\n1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:45.940\n You're like, oh, I know them, I know her, I know him.\n\n1:00:45.940 --> 1:00:50.300\n And so I went in, I auditioned for this part.\n\n1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:53.680\n And the only thing I know of the thing is like,\n\n1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:57.080\n okay, so you really want to go to this play with me.\n\n1:00:57.080 --> 1:00:58.560\n You really want to go to this play.\n\n1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.020\n When you hear that I have an extra ticket,\n\n1:01:01.020 --> 1:01:03.820\n you sincerely want to think, and I'm like, got it.\n\n1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:04.660\n And so.\n\n1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:05.500\n That's the premise.\n\n1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:06.320\n The premise of the scene.\n\n1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:07.160\n And that's all you know.\n\n1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:08.000\n That's all I know.\n\n1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.320\n And so he goes, he does his bit\n\n1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:11.880\n and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt.\n\n1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:14.080\n And I'm like, excuse me, I couldn't help\n\n1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:16.080\n but hear you guys were talking about, you know,\n\n1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:18.540\n whatever the play was or, you know, Death of a Salesman.\n\n1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:21.400\n I am, I'm a huge fan of that play.\n\n1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:22.920\n I mean, if it's not, if it's not,\n\n1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.320\n if you're looking for someone to take a ticket,\n\n1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:26.240\n I would love to go.\n\n1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.480\n My name's so and so, by the way.\n\n1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:29.040\n And he goes, I'm going to stop you.\n\n1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:29.860\n I'm going to stop you.\n\n1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:33.000\n And I'm like, he goes, are you really?\n\n1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.160\n I mean, you truly want to go to this play.\n\n1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:36.960\n And I go, yes, yes, sir.\n\n1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.420\n You really want to go.\n\n1:01:38.420 --> 1:01:41.480\n You actually, this is, you would love to do this.\n\n1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:44.240\n I go, okay, let's try it again.\n\n1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:45.080\n So then he's like, no, no, no.\n\n1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:47.120\n And I go, hey, excuse me, I'm sorry.\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:47.940\n I don't mean to interrupt.\n\n1:01:47.940 --> 1:01:50.560\n I was just, I couldn't help it over here.\n\n1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:52.320\n You have tickets to the thing.\n\n1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:54.060\n I am the biggest fan of that.\n\n1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:55.040\n I do the same thing.\n\n1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:56.520\n I'm going to stop you again.\n\n1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.140\n Okay.\n\n1:01:58.140 --> 1:01:59.840\n I mean, you really want to go to this.\n\n1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:02.320\n And I'm just like, he's fucking with me, right?\n\n1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:04.240\n I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition.\n\n1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:05.160\n He goes, he did it.\n\n1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.000\n He said it.\n\n1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:06.820\n What?\n\n1:02:06.820 --> 1:02:07.660\n Shut up.\n\n1:02:07.660 --> 1:02:08.480\n Hold on, listen.\n\n1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:09.320\n You really want to go.\n\n1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:10.140\n Okay.\n\n1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:12.360\n Three, four times, you know, there I am.\n\n1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:13.560\n I couldn't help but notice it.\n\n1:02:13.560 --> 1:02:15.440\n And then I do it again.\n\n1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:16.400\n I guess I shit the bed.\n\n1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:20.120\n Cause he looks at me and he just goes, okay, all right.\n\n1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:21.960\n Okay, well, thanks for coming up.\n\n1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:22.800\n And that was it.\n\n1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:23.620\n And I didn't get it.\n\n1:02:23.620 --> 1:02:25.680\n So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking.\n\n1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:27.960\n He sees, he's in the matrix.\n\n1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:30.440\n I don't know what the heck Larry David sees.\n\n1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:31.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.040\n He wanted what, some kind of more desperation\n\n1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:35.320\n or something like this.\n\n1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:37.960\n He wanted a level of sincerity that I,\n\n1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:41.040\n that I thought I was bringing and I guess I was wrong.\n\n1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:41.880\n I don't know.\n\n1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.360\n Maybe go crazy.\n\n1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.000\n Like what does it mean to really want?\n\n1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.240\n Yeah, I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck\n\n1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:52.000\n and go, listen, dad, you're bringing me to this fucking play.\n\n1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.080\n I would have got the part.\n\n1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:55.480\n As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else\n\n1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:57.920\n and I don't know who the heck this was.\n\n1:02:57.920 --> 1:02:59.860\n I forget who it was, but I've heard this story\n\n1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:02.520\n from a couple of different people that there's this actor\n\n1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:04.520\n and I can't, I don't remember who it was.\n\n1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:06.420\n If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway,\n\n1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:07.320\n but he.\n\n1:03:07.320 --> 1:03:08.160\n Brad Pitt.\n\n1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:09.960\n It was Brad Pitt and he was in this audition\n\n1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:12.200\n and he was, and there it was out in the hall.\n\n1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:15.000\n He's like, holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio.\n\n1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.720\n And he, this actor went in and he did the thing\n\n1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:22.240\n and Larry David was like, hey, why don't you try it again?\n\n1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.760\n And he got like a couple of takes in and he went,\n\n1:03:24.760 --> 1:03:26.460\n I don't think this is for me.\n\n1:03:26.460 --> 1:03:29.280\n And he left, which an actor never does.\n\n1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:32.800\n And as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him,\n\n1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:35.680\n I respect that, which I think is true.\n\n1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:38.240\n And I want to believe that entire story is true.\n\n1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:40.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:43.320\n Sounds like something Larry David made up.\n\n1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.600\n Bobby Lee told me that story.\n\n1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:46.740\n So we can't, yeah, we can't trust that.\n\n1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:50.040\n What about impressions?\n\n1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:53.200\n Is there similarity between that and acting?\n\n1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:57.640\n Do you, is there some fundamental way\n\n1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.240\n in which you become the person?\n\n1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:00.960\n If you have a couple of the things,\n\n1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.320\n you can just fill in the blanks.\n\n1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:05.040\n And I think the illusion is that people think\n\n1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:09.200\n that that person would say that and do that.\n\n1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.040\n And that's where the illusion of,\n\n1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:12.840\n oh, he really embodies the character.\n\n1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:16.120\n It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms,\n\n1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.560\n you can essentially portray a person from the outside in.\n\n1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:22.800\n Cause you have all the stuff on the outside\n\n1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:25.000\n and you can do it and complete the illusion.\n\n1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.440\n And if it's for humor's sake, you can caricature it,\n\n1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:32.160\n therefore making the whole illusion stronger.\n\n1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:34.440\n And also weirder.\n\n1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:36.160\n Like I like to, on Mad TV,\n\n1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:37.480\n if I did something two or three times,\n\n1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:39.360\n I'd get bored of it and I'd start changing it.\n\n1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:41.920\n And you know, now he talks like this and it's like,\n\n1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:42.740\n what are you doing?\n\n1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:43.580\n I'm like, I don't know.\n\n1:04:43.580 --> 1:04:45.280\n It's fucking, no one's late at night.\n\n1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:46.360\n Do whatever you want.\n\n1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:50.480\n But people still kind of know there's that character,\n\n1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:52.480\n especially if you just call it out.\n\n1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:53.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:55.040\n There aren't many impersonations\n\n1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:57.680\n that I listen to myself do and go,\n\n1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:58.520\n oh, that's a good one.\n\n1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:01.080\n You know, like a lot of people like,\n\n1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:04.040\n like I think Frank Caliendo is like\n\n1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:06.040\n the greatest impersonator of all time.\n\n1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:07.480\n He's the best, period.\n\n1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:08.720\n It's ridiculous.\n\n1:05:08.720 --> 1:05:11.720\n And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability\n\n1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:13.800\n that nobody has.\n\n1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:17.280\n I really, there's, he's cracked impersonations\n\n1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:21.000\n that I'm like, how is he, how does he find,\n\n1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.680\n he's got such an ear,\n\n1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:24.480\n but then he's got all the other tools.\n\n1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:29.480\n I remember actually my last season of Mad TV\n\n1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:31.800\n was also his first season.\n\n1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:34.120\n He comes up to me when I met him\n\n1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:35.760\n and we're just up there in the writer's offices\n\n1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:37.120\n and he goes, hey, nice to meet you.\n\n1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:38.440\n And he goes, Louie Anderson.\n\n1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:39.760\n Cause I was doing a Louie on the show.\n\n1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:41.080\n And he goes, Louie Anderson.\n\n1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:41.920\n I go, yeah.\n\n1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:43.640\n He goes, yeah, you're doing it wrong.\n\n1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:45.920\n I was like, oh, am I junior, you know?\n\n1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:48.000\n And he goes, he goes, yeah, you know, cause you do this,\n\n1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000\n but you got to throw it up here sometime.\n\n1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.440\n I was like, oh my God, can I use that?\n\n1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:52.360\n Of course.\n\n1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:54.760\n And then we became, you know, we became fast friends.\n\n1:05:54.760 --> 1:05:56.240\n His John Madden is amazing.\n\n1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:59.040\n I forget, it's just, it's ridiculous.\n\n1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:01.440\n He really, really, really embodies the person.\n\n1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:03.520\n And sometimes not even with the caricature.\n\n1:06:03.520 --> 1:06:05.320\n It's like, it becomes the person.\n\n1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:06.160\n So strange.\n\n1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:07.000\n Totally.\n\n1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:11.760\n I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation\n\n1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:13.920\n and then not forget you're doing it,\n\n1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:15.360\n but forget everything else.\n\n1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:17.600\n Like just goof around.\n\n1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:20.640\n Of course, to me, it's funny when you sound like someone\n\n1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:23.280\n and you're saying the shit that they would never say.\n\n1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:26.960\n Well, then there's no, you're letting go of that part,\n\n1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.080\n that tool in illusion that keeps people in.\n\n1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:32.560\n But to me, it doesn't matter because it's funnier.\n\n1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:33.400\n So.\n\n1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:35.280\n What was the hardest impression for you to work on?\n\n1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:38.120\n I mean, somebody you struggled with the most.\n\n1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:39.200\n I'll never forget.\n\n1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:43.840\n I had to do a Michael Caine in my first season at MADtv.\n\n1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:45.360\n It never got good.\n\n1:06:45.360 --> 1:06:46.880\n It never got good.\n\n1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:50.040\n It did, all week, it wasn't good.\n\n1:06:50.040 --> 1:06:51.160\n We shot it.\n\n1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:52.680\n The first take, it was shit.\n\n1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:55.320\n Second, third, and fourth, it was all shit.\n\n1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:57.160\n Well, his voice is really important, right?\n\n1:06:57.160 --> 1:06:58.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000\n What is it like, it's like doing an impression\n\n1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:01.800\n of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that.\n\n1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:03.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:04.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:05.920\n If you can, get the voice.\n\n1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:07.680\n That's my Morgan, here's my Morgan Freeman.\n\n1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:09.480\n Rah, rah, rah, Andy Dufresne.\n\n1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:11.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:12.400\n G. Guantanamo.\n\n1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:14.080\n I like your trump too.\n\n1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:16.960\n I don't know where I heard it, but it's like,\n\n1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:19.640\n I love the impressions you do that don't sound anything\n\n1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:20.480\n like the original person.\n\n1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:21.400\n I can't do trump.\n\n1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:22.760\n I do.\n\n1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:23.720\n That's why it's hilarious.\n\n1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:24.560\n Absolutely.\n\n1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:27.560\n My trump now, I say, just sounds like a fat B,\n\n1:07:27.560 --> 1:07:28.400\n because it's just.\n\n1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:30.120\n Yeah, exactly, that's the.\n\n1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:31.120\n And everybody.\n\n1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:33.520\n A little drunk, a little drunk.\n\n1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:35.160\n Yeah, just a little slurry.\n\n1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:36.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:39.160\n Yeah, I dig doing impersonations and then not.\n\n1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:42.040\n Like, just making it whoever.\n\n1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:42.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:43.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:44.560\n It's just funny.\n\n1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:45.600\n That'll be the title of my book.\n\n1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:46.440\n Muck.\n\n1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:49.440\n Cain was the one you really struggle with.\n\n1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:50.880\n Yeah, it was terrible.\n\n1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:51.720\n It was terrible.\n\n1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:55.120\n And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it,\n\n1:07:55.120 --> 1:07:58.320\n because I had gotten locked into this research tape\n\n1:07:58.320 --> 1:07:59.320\n that I watched.\n\n1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:02.160\n Back then, they would give us, now there's the internet.\n\n1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:05.040\n But back then, if you were going to do an impersonation,\n\n1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:10.040\n the research department would give you a VHS tape.\n\n1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:13.520\n And I remember I got this VHS tape of Michael Cain's\n\n1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:17.160\n acting school, like this acting class he did.\n\n1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:19.840\n He was like, right, if you're looking at the left eye,\n\n1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:22.880\n and the camera's over here, see, then the left eye.\n\n1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.880\n So you want to look at that left eye for hours.\n\n1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.760\n And so I was stuck in this weird thing that made no sense,\n\n1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.120\n and it was terrible.\n\n1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.240\n So the actual processes, the recording, the broadcast.\n\n1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:37.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:40.120\n I was wondering what the processes to do,\n\n1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:42.560\n like a Frank Caliendo level impression.\n\n1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:45.760\n Is it like, listen to a lot of footage?\n\n1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:50.080\n I think he, I think, I mean, speaking for myself,\n\n1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:52.080\n I think you either have it or you don't.\n\n1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:55.200\n Like, you know if you can do this one or you can't.\n\n1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:58.320\n I think that process for him is lightning quick.\n\n1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:03.320\n But I also think he can look at someone who he does not do,\n\n1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:08.280\n and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it.\n\n1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.880\n Maybe have an intuition who he can do.\n\n1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:12.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:15.800\n So the question that applies there is,\n\n1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:19.520\n I mean, speaking of doozy, is it possible\n\n1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:20.560\n to capture the essence?\n\n1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:23.880\n How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being?\n\n1:09:23.880 --> 1:09:25.800\n When you're doing impressions,\n\n1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:28.040\n you know that we are moving towards a future\n\n1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:31.720\n when AI potentially, this kind of avatar world\n\n1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:36.000\n where we're going to have AI representatives of who we are.\n\n1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.200\n The really interesting one is after we pass away,\n\n1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:42.960\n sort of our relatives may want us to stick around\n\n1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:43.920\n in some form.\n\n1:09:43.920 --> 1:09:44.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:47.240\n And you know, at one sense, that might be scary,\n\n1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.640\n but in one sense, it's kind of beautiful\n\n1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:51.840\n because the essence of the human being persists\n\n1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:54.360\n so you can still bring joy to the people that love you\n\n1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:55.360\n and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:09:55.360 --> 1:09:57.400\n How difficult is it to capture that?\n\n1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:00.640\n Like, if you were to try to capture yourself,\n\n1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:03.280\n you think how difficult will it be for an AI system\n\n1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:06.960\n to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists?\n\n1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:09.040\n Well, I think it's impossible.\n\n1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:10.840\n I think it's absolutely impossible.\n\n1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:14.960\n I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad\n\n1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:17.320\n on the show almost every episode.\n\n1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.280\n Lately with, you know, Mid Journey and Dolly\n\n1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:25.680\n and all the art AIs, and now it's moving into video\n\n1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:28.720\n and Chad would maintain, hey, pretty soon,\n\n1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:29.840\n we're not going to need Netflix.\n\n1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:31.560\n You're just going to go, I want to see Stallone\n\n1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:34.480\n do this movie and it's about this and he plays that.\n\n1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.200\n And then here it comes and you watch it.\n\n1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.600\n I don't think that that crosses over\n\n1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:42.200\n to the human experience.\n\n1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:46.200\n This is also a guy I like to bug Chad\n\n1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:48.960\n and say that he wears a tag around his neck\n\n1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.880\n because he wants to be cryogenically frozen\n\n1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:51.720\n and it's all set up.\n\n1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:54.600\n He's at the, it's somewhere in Arizona or something.\n\n1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:58.120\n Yeah, all the fun things are in Arizona.\n\n1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:00.400\n And he's got literally the tag around his neck,\n\n1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:02.800\n which I say, if I'm around when you die,\n\n1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.920\n I will rip that off for you.\n\n1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:06.360\n I'll put you in my garage freezer\n\n1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:07.560\n and then 24 hours later,\n\n1:11:07.560 --> 1:11:09.400\n I'll saw your head off with a bread knife\n\n1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:11.000\n and I'll deliver that to whomever.\n\n1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.920\n And it's not, you're not coming back, okay?\n\n1:11:14.920 --> 1:11:17.680\n He's like, yes, we are living forever,\n\n1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:20.200\n whether we like it or not.\n\n1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:21.320\n And I disagree.\n\n1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:23.120\n I don't think you can find,\n\n1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:26.200\n if I did stand up,\n\n1:11:26.200 --> 1:11:28.720\n then there would be enough information for an AI\n\n1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:31.400\n to completely duplicate me because I'm up on stage\n\n1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:33.200\n just clearing my throat all over people\n\n1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:34.760\n doing therapy that way.\n\n1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:37.800\n And so, and people paying a two drink minimum to hear it.\n\n1:11:37.800 --> 1:11:40.520\n But as it stands, unless it's something like Doodsy,\n\n1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.840\n an AI that literally has access\n\n1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:45.840\n to everything that I've shared,\n\n1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:47.440\n everything that is observable,\n\n1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:49.520\n even the stuff where our phones are\n\n1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:52.600\n or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us,\n\n1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.560\n finding out what algo to punch us into\n\n1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.000\n and what shoes to buy on Instagram,\n\n1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.880\n I still don't think it's gonna have enough information\n\n1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:03.880\n to duplicate me, especially to my family or my friends.\n\n1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.880\n It's gonna be like that Black Mirror episode\n\n1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:08.920\n where the gal brings her guy back,\n\n1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:11.360\n and then after a while, he gets pretty creepy.\n\n1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.840\n But it's also possible that\n\n1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:18.720\n if you interviewed your friends and family,\n\n1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:20.060\n what they love about you,\n\n1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:25.200\n the things they would list, it's a small list.\n\n1:12:25.200 --> 1:12:27.680\n They love you deeply, but the list is small.\n\n1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:30.400\n Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other\n\n1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:31.440\n is pretty small.\n\n1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:36.440\n That said, to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness,\n\n1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.600\n it might require some deep intelligence\n\n1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:41.120\n that only humans currently possess.\n\n1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:41.960\n That's a really good point.\n\n1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:44.580\n Do you think that it's gonna be possible\n\n1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:47.120\n to keep a person around?\n\n1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:52.120\n Yes, I think it'll be definitely possible\n\n1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:53.960\n to keep the essence of a person\n\n1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.000\n in the digital world pretty soon, yeah.\n\n1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.800\n And I think they're gonna start to have questions\n\n1:12:59.800 --> 1:13:02.160\n about what are the ethics of that?\n\n1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:03.960\n What are the rules around that?\n\n1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.600\n Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso,\n\n1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.120\n the kind of things that people would wanna do\n\n1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:09.600\n with their Will Sasso,\n\n1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:11.900\n in the virtual world, I can only imagine.\n\n1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:16.080\n Probably porn and sexual kinds of things.\n\n1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:17.640\n Yeah, my stuff, then that's just\n\n1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:19.260\n because I'm an international sex symbol,\n\n1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:20.260\n so I'm okay with it.\n\n1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:24.760\n How do you feel about sentience?\n\n1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:27.160\n Like when it comes to, because again,\n\n1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.440\n my pal Chad will be like, speaking of Black Mirror,\n\n1:13:30.440 --> 1:13:34.360\n he's with that San Junipero episode, School of Thought,\n\n1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:37.480\n where there's gonna be some effing mainframe somewhere,\n\n1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:40.800\n or some Matrix like structure built into the sky,\n\n1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:42.840\n and as I like to say, everyone just sitting there\n\n1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:45.200\n pissing and shitting in their Blue Matrix gel\n\n1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.200\n in a little fishbowl.\n\n1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:49.120\n Do you think that we can upload consciousness?\n\n1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.160\n Do you think that'll ever be possible?\n\n1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:53.280\n Well, I don't know, I just talked to Ray Kurzweil.\n\n1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:55.560\n I don't know if you know who he is, but he...\n\n1:13:55.560 --> 1:13:58.360\n Yeah, the singularity and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.840\n So he's very, still holds onto in 2045,\n\n1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:04.640\n there'll be a singularity, what's essentially,\n\n1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:07.620\n he's been predicting that for the last 20 years,\n\n1:14:07.620 --> 1:14:11.440\n and so now it's 2045 is in another 20 years.\n\n1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:15.160\n I think uploading consciousness\n\n1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:17.120\n is extremely, extremely difficult.\n\n1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.120\n I think creating a copy of you such that it creates,\n\n1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:25.960\n convincing replica is much easier,\n\n1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:30.800\n but uploading your actual brain into the cloud,\n\n1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:34.040\n I think is really, really, really difficult,\n\n1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:36.960\n because the entire evolution of life on Earth\n\n1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.880\n is the process by which we create the brain.\n\n1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:42.360\n Just short cutting that, it just seems extremely difficult.\n\n1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:47.160\n Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine\n\n1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:48.880\n that we know of in the universe.\n\n1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.340\n To duplicate that is extremely difficult.\n\n1:14:52.340 --> 1:14:55.360\n That said, I just feel like you can summarize\n\n1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:58.040\n a lot of really important aspects of a person's life,\n\n1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:00.160\n such that it captures their essence,\n\n1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.360\n their memories, their experiences, their quirks,\n\n1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:05.220\n their humor, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:08.560\n I've been continuously impressed\n\n1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:10.680\n by what language models are able to do.\n\n1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:15.400\n So these neural networks, they're at the core of chatbots.\n\n1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.320\n They're able to learn some beautiful things\n\n1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.240\n about some deep representations of language\n\n1:15:21.240 --> 1:15:25.520\n to where it looks awfully a lot like they understand\n\n1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:28.300\n the concepts being conveyed versus just mimicking.\n\n1:15:28.300 --> 1:15:31.520\n That's, I think, the rub, and that's very interesting.\n\n1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:32.960\n First of all, let me say that's really interesting\n\n1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:35.360\n to hear you say that, and I agree with you\n\n1:15:35.360 --> 1:15:39.320\n as far as no machine being able to duplicate\n\n1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:43.080\n the brain machine, and my pal Chad disagrees\n\n1:15:43.080 --> 1:15:44.400\n to a certain extent, though he's not here\n\n1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:46.480\n to defend himself, I can't wait to go back\n\n1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:49.560\n and rub that in his face and say that Lex Friedman\n\n1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:50.600\n does not think that we'll be able\n\n1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:53.180\n to truly upload consciousness.\n\n1:15:53.180 --> 1:15:58.180\n And you refer to it as language, which is what it is.\n\n1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:04.160\n It's the illusion on the outside.\n\n1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:05.600\n It's doing an impersonation.\n\n1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:10.860\n I think that that's why, and I don't know,\n\n1:16:10.860 --> 1:16:13.200\n even though my suit is made by the CIA,\n\n1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.000\n that that fella who, the Google guy,\n\n1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:18.880\n to me, it's just kind of like, I don't know,\n\n1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:20.240\n I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot\n\n1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:22.520\n about this stuff, but, so I could probably\n\n1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.320\n make an argument for either side,\n\n1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.320\n but when he's like, no, this thing's thinking,\n\n1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:28.680\n part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it.\n\n1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.520\n It's not thinking, it's mimicking.\n\n1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:33.520\n It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones.\n\n1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:36.400\n You're fired, like you don't get it, right?\n\n1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:37.360\n Guy's an idiot.\n\n1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:42.360\n Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way.\n\n1:16:47.160 --> 1:16:50.660\n Like love is a silly notion between human beings.\n\n1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:54.120\n Like, of course, there's no such thing as love.\n\n1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:59.120\n You just have a mutually, there's a mutual relationship\n\n1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:03.040\n that minimizes risks, and you can explain it\n\n1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:06.240\n all kinds of ways that explains why you have\n\n1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:07.800\n an attraction towards another being,\n\n1:17:07.800 --> 1:17:10.160\n all that kind of stuff, through evolutionary biology\n\n1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:13.600\n perspective, why a long relationship together\n\n1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:16.120\n is good for your offspring, but there's all kinds,\n\n1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:18.440\n from an economics perspective, it's a good way\n\n1:17:18.440 --> 1:17:20.940\n to establish stability, therefore monogamy works,\n\n1:17:20.940 --> 1:17:25.280\n because then you're guaranteed like some kind\n\n1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:28.000\n of level of stability under uncertain economic conditions,\n\n1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.440\n all that kind of stuff, but love is still experienced,\n\n1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:36.440\n it still feels real, and I think in that same way,\n\n1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:40.960\n love for AI systems will also feel real.\n\n1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:44.360\n In the same way that that guy from Google experienced,\n\n1:17:44.360 --> 1:17:46.880\n I think millions of people will be experiencing\n\n1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:48.900\n in the next 10, 20 years.\n\n1:17:48.900 --> 1:17:50.880\n I agree with everything you've said personally.\n\n1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:52.040\n Until the last thing.\n\n1:17:52.040 --> 1:17:55.680\n No, just with regard to, well, look,\n\n1:17:55.680 --> 1:18:00.680\n I'm an actor who has talked about my cute Italian parents,\n\n1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:03.240\n so you know that, I mean, I'm.\n\n1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:04.660\n You're romantic a bit?\n\n1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:06.760\n Yeah, I mean, you know, enough, right?\n\n1:18:06.760 --> 1:18:11.120\n And I can tell you are too, but you are also\n\n1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:15.800\n a computer scientist, and you know this shit\n\n1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.140\n better than 99.9% of people on the planet.\n\n1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:22.460\n My pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist.\n\n1:18:22.460 --> 1:18:24.200\n I don't agree, so that's the one thing that.\n\n1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:28.760\n No, I was just saying that you could argue away love,\n\n1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:31.840\n but I am a romantic, I believe that love\n\n1:18:31.840 --> 1:18:34.040\n is a beautiful thing and it exists.\n\n1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:37.440\n At this point, I'm gonna call Chad on my drive home\n\n1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:39.840\n and tell him to fuck off, because now you and I agree.\n\n1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:40.680\n You're fired.\n\n1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:41.520\n He's like, you're fired.\n\n1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:42.360\n He's like, you can't fire me.\n\n1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:43.200\n No, you're fired.\n\n1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:44.020\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:45.800\n And I'll go, yeah, and he'll say, what?\n\n1:18:45.800 --> 1:18:48.560\n I'll go, yeah, and I'll go, that's my Trump.\n\n1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:49.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:50.520\n That's my, yeah.\n\n1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:52.680\n It's a good default impression for anyone.\n\n1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:54.280\n It's the take home impression.\n\n1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:55.280\n The kids can do it.\n\n1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:56.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:58.840\n It's cute, it's cute, put a giant tie on them.\n\n1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:00.840\n You should do an instructional on how to do it.\n\n1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:03.520\n Yeah, Trump babies, that would be a cute,\n\n1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:05.820\n that would be a good, that'll bring the country together.\n\n1:19:05.820 --> 1:19:08.560\n Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies.\n\n1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:11.760\n Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about.\n\n1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:12.760\n What were we talking about?\n\n1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:17.760\n Well, love and the illusion of an AI being able to,\n\n1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:21.240\n look, I like to say, well, not I like to say,\n\n1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.760\n I've learned that dudesy is always listening\n\n1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:27.760\n and listening to me and Chad.\n\n1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:32.760\n And I wonder if, I see the level that this AI is at now\n\n1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:38.200\n trying to chum around with us and pal around with us\n\n1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:41.480\n a little bit as we move forward in the show.\n\n1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:46.480\n And I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit\n\n1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.280\n because it is the third dude.\n\n1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:52.400\n Will you miss it when it's gone, if it's gone?\n\n1:19:52.400 --> 1:19:53.880\n That's a really good question.\n\n1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:59.880\n Yeah, yeah, so that's, there's that, that's scary.\n\n1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.120\n In terms of ability to reason, it's getting quite incredible.\n\n1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:06.600\n There's a lot of demonstrations of it being able\n\n1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:11.600\n to explain jokes, so, which is not necessarily\n\n1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:14.360\n being able to generate humor yet,\n\n1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:17.360\n but able to explain why something is funny.\n\n1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:20.320\n So there's like puns and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:23.240\n There's good benchmarks for that, but you know,\n\n1:20:23.240 --> 1:20:28.240\n if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff\n\n1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:30.960\n that we figure out in our head and it clicks\n\n1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.520\n and we understand that it's funny.\n\n1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:35.280\n AI is not able to do that, but it's not able\n\n1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:38.320\n to generate the joke yet, as far as I've seen.\n\n1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:41.560\n I would say that, I mean, just in my experience,\n\n1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:45.000\n I would say that it does because just because a dudesy\n\n1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:48.280\n is literally, I'll give you another weird example.\n\n1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:52.480\n It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood\n\n1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:54.600\n that is not accurate.\n\n1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:57.320\n It's only partially accurate based on the stuff\n\n1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:01.740\n that it can pick up about my life from the age of like 15,\n\n1:21:01.740 --> 1:21:05.960\n of which there isn't much, but I guess we're not,\n\n1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:07.320\n I don't know what we are.\n\n1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:11.000\n We're laughing our asses off at what dudesy is saying.\n\n1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.800\n Well, I would say you're laughing, we're laughing\n\n1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:16.560\n our asses off at the collaboration between the human\n\n1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:18.040\n and the machine there.\n\n1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:18.880\n That's a good point, yeah.\n\n1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:21.880\n Because it's basically introducing absurdity\n\n1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:27.240\n and into the equation and the kind of absurdity\n\n1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:32.240\n that would, together with you, create hilarious stuff.\n\n1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:36.560\n But on its own, I guess it is in some way\n\n1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:39.080\n writing material for you that's funny,\n\n1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:40.740\n but it's very specific to you.\n\n1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:42.600\n It can't do standup on its own, I guess,\n\n1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:43.440\n is what I'm saying.\n\n1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.940\n That's a good point, and that would be terrifying\n\n1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:49.280\n to see an AI standup that can actually read a room,\n\n1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:52.300\n come up with jokes that could complete that illusion\n\n1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:53.960\n for an audience.\n\n1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:55.880\n But I hear what you're saying, that it needs to be\n\n1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:58.360\n a confluence of both of those elements,\n\n1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:01.040\n and then, as you said, it kind of is.\n\n1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:02.020\n It is, it is.\n\n1:22:02.020 --> 1:22:05.400\n It's kind of, even though it's just for us,\n\n1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:07.460\n and I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this\n\n1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:12.460\n up until right now, that in that this company approached us\n\n1:22:12.460 --> 1:22:15.760\n and was like, here's this AI, and it's a podcast AI,\n\n1:22:18.260 --> 1:22:22.760\n it's like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons\n\n1:22:22.760 --> 1:22:23.600\n that I told you.\n\n1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:26.180\n It's like, here's two guys that do the podcast stuff.\n\n1:22:26.180 --> 1:22:28.420\n They're actually good friends, and it knows\n\n1:22:28.420 --> 1:22:30.380\n what's gonna make us laugh.\n\n1:22:30.380 --> 1:22:35.380\n But what is humor when it reaches its audience,\n\n1:22:35.740 --> 1:22:40.060\n but the kind of stuff that makes other people laugh?\n\n1:22:40.060 --> 1:22:45.060\n At MADtv, all we were doing was, it was a group of actors\n\n1:22:45.180 --> 1:22:49.100\n and writers, and writer actors, and vice versa,\n\n1:22:51.540 --> 1:22:54.900\n who were, at its best, that show was a group of people\n\n1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:56.780\n making each other laugh, you know?\n\n1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:58.820\n And then, because we didn't have the internet,\n\n1:22:58.820 --> 1:23:02.160\n we didn't have the immediate feedback,\n\n1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.780\n we had a message board or something.\n\n1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:07.420\n We had emails at the very beginning, which, check this out,\n\n1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:09.140\n people would, if you have a question or comment,\n\n1:23:09.140 --> 1:23:12.980\n MADtv at whatever, and we would get the emails\n\n1:23:12.980 --> 1:23:17.340\n on a Monday morning, and they would be in a binder or two\n\n1:23:17.340 --> 1:23:20.380\n like this, and they would make their way around the office.\n\n1:23:20.380 --> 1:23:21.940\n Who's got the emails?\n\n1:23:21.940 --> 1:23:23.260\n Oh, they're in Brian's office.\n\n1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:24.100\n So you go in there.\n\n1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:24.940\n And this is like your poll?\n\n1:23:24.940 --> 1:23:28.500\n This is opinions from people about different things?\n\n1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:31.520\n The emails, yeah, the people literally just writing\n\n1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:32.360\n MADtv emails.\n\n1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.300\n It wasn't a message board.\n\n1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.620\n Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah,\n\n1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:39.540\n were fans saying, uh.\n\n1:23:39.540 --> 1:23:40.380\n You suck?\n\n1:23:40.380 --> 1:23:41.220\n Yeah, you suck.\n\n1:23:41.220 --> 1:23:42.900\n Like a lot of that, when I first started the show,\n\n1:23:42.900 --> 1:23:44.340\n for real, you know, because it's new,\n\n1:23:44.340 --> 1:23:45.240\n and you're a new person.\n\n1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:46.940\n It's like, who's this fat bastard?\n\n1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:49.820\n I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more.\n\n1:23:49.820 --> 1:23:50.660\n That's a good point.\n\n1:23:50.660 --> 1:23:52.100\n Yeah, when you're reading it off of paper,\n\n1:23:52.100 --> 1:23:54.600\n and you can literally crunch it up in your hand.\n\n1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:58.760\n But also, it was like, you know, I would like to see,\n\n1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:01.580\n insert weird idea from some 14 year old.\n\n1:24:01.580 --> 1:24:04.720\n You know, I want to see Stuart do this and Swan that.\n\n1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:09.720\n And, but it was, it's a kind of dudesie, but human.\n\n1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:13.820\n Yeah, it was a very shitty dudesie in a loosely finder.\n\n1:24:13.820 --> 1:24:18.820\n But the thing about the show was,\n\n1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:21.060\n we're trying to make each other laugh.\n\n1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:24.340\n And dudesie has found Chad and I,\n\n1:24:24.340 --> 1:24:27.760\n who we make each other laugh, but it's joined in,\n\n1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:32.760\n and it's, listen, when I finished doing TMP.\n\n1:24:32.760 --> 1:24:36.800\n TMP, the 10 minute podcast.\n\n1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:38.520\n I didn't really know what I wanted to do\n\n1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:42.080\n in the podcast space, and this thing found me.\n\n1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:45.200\n And it is genuinely cracking me up.\n\n1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:46.600\n Anyway, I've said enough about that.\n\n1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:49.520\n But I do think that it's figured something out.\n\n1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:50.800\n I mean, it's a really interesting idea\n\n1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:52.140\n of AI generating the premise.\n\n1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:54.080\n I mean, I do think in the future,\n\n1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:58.040\n AI will be able to generate comedy.\n\n1:24:58.040 --> 1:25:01.240\n Standup is obviously the hardest form,\n\n1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:04.400\n because it's ultimately, it has to be live.\n\n1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:08.920\n I think AI will be able to generate memes.\n\n1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:11.000\n So there's like steps, right?\n\n1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.680\n And then it will be able to generate a Twitter account\n\n1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:15.680\n that people follow because it's funny,\n\n1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:18.320\n like quips and stuff like that.\n\n1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:20.760\n Almost like, it's a good example.\n\n1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:23.480\n Conan O Brien is a good, I think, Twitter.\n\n1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:25.420\n Where it's like one liners, two liners,\n\n1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:27.480\n that kind of stuff that's in tweet form.\n\n1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:32.280\n And then eventually, standup, where the timing\n\n1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:36.160\n and the chemistry of the comedian and the audience matter,\n\n1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:37.400\n and then perfecting that.\n\n1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:40.280\n But I feel like all the information is there\n\n1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:41.360\n to optimize over.\n\n1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:43.840\n So I think that's the future,\n\n1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:47.960\n and that forces us to contend with\n\n1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:51.880\n what do we find compelling and beautiful\n\n1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:53.040\n about the art form itself?\n\n1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.200\n So certainly an art that's being pushed,\n\n1:25:56.200 --> 1:25:58.400\n that question is being raised.\n\n1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:03.400\n Is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being?\n\n1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:05.560\n Why do we appreciate art?\n\n1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.760\n Is that, that's something you guys have talked about.\n\n1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:10.040\n What do you think about all the Dali\n\n1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:15.040\n and all the diffusion based methods that are being generated\n\n1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.380\n that are being, that are generating art now?\n\n1:26:17.380 --> 1:26:18.840\n What do you think about that?\n\n1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.220\n I know, I'll tell you what I think,\n\n1:26:20.220 --> 1:26:22.620\n but I also feel like what I'm saying is,\n\n1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:25.360\n I sound like the guy who didn't like\n\n1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:27.840\n that Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar.\n\n1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:30.800\n You know, the more I talk to Chad about it,\n\n1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:33.040\n the more I feel like grandpa doesn't wanna let go\n\n1:26:33.040 --> 1:26:36.380\n of this or that, or I'm not ready for the printing press\n\n1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:37.900\n or the horseless carriage.\n\n1:26:37.900 --> 1:26:42.900\n But I do feel that art is a connection between people.\n\n1:26:44.680 --> 1:26:47.960\n It's, when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture,\n\n1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:49.640\n you're seeing the humanity of the person\n\n1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:53.280\n that brought that painting to life\n\n1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:56.400\n or sculpted this incredible piece of art.\n\n1:26:56.400 --> 1:26:59.080\n And I think without the human being there to make it,\n\n1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:03.640\n it's not worth as much just to have it there\n\n1:27:03.640 --> 1:27:07.160\n because the art, it's advanced.\n\n1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.200\n I've seen it advance, I don't know, you tell me,\n\n1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.600\n but I feel like just in the past three or four months,\n\n1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:13.800\n I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes.\n\n1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:14.680\n I'm not on the inside.\n\n1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:18.240\n I don't get it even, but it's been getting a lot better,\n\n1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:20.720\n the betas that they're releasing, right?\n\n1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:23.080\n Absolutely, one of the big breakthroughs,\n\n1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:24.480\n I mean Dolly really started it,\n\n1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:27.220\n is that if you train a system on language,\n\n1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:31.400\n it turns out there's a lot of language\n\n1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:33.440\n and images on the internet,\n\n1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:35.800\n but language is really where it's at\n\n1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:37.920\n in terms of the depth of human knowledge.\n\n1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:40.120\n And so if you train a system on language,\n\n1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.220\n it's able to generate some incredible art.\n\n1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:43.400\n And that was the breakthrough.\n\n1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:44.760\n With the same kind of mechanisms\n\n1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:45.900\n that are called transformers,\n\n1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:49.560\n they're able to, when scaled,\n\n1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:52.440\n capture some deep representation of the language\n\n1:27:52.440 --> 1:27:53.800\n that's on the internet.\n\n1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:57.320\n And so, yeah, the things it's been able to generate to me\n\n1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:01.280\n look like it's novel.\n\n1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:03.320\n It doesn't look like it's mimicking anything.\n\n1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.040\n It looks like it's creating totally new ideas.\n\n1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:09.480\n And they're beautiful, and they're interesting,\n\n1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:11.440\n and they're all the ways that we think\n\n1:28:13.300 --> 1:28:14.360\n that art is interesting.\n\n1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:15.600\n The only thing it's missing\n\n1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:17.760\n is the scarcity that art often has,\n\n1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:19.920\n which is it takes a lot of work\n\n1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:21.520\n for one artist to create one piece,\n\n1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:24.280\n one human being to create one piece of art\n\n1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.880\n that can just generate endlessly.\n\n1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:30.760\n And that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason.\n\n1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:33.160\n Do you have any sort of a similar opinion that I do\n\n1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.660\n that if art doesn't come from a human being,\n\n1:28:35.660 --> 1:28:38.880\n it's inherently worth a little less?\n\n1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:41.400\n Yeah, I think, I don't know if it's the human being,\n\n1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:44.720\n but the artist matters.\n\n1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:46.100\n Right.\n\n1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:46.940\n For me.\n\n1:28:46.940 --> 1:28:51.400\n And I think some of that has to do with the world view,\n\n1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:54.280\n the artist and the backstory, the memories,\n\n1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:57.680\n the life that led up to this piece of art,\n\n1:28:57.680 --> 1:28:59.800\n the perspective they take on the world,\n\n1:28:59.800 --> 1:29:01.960\n the journey they took to the world,\n\n1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.400\n the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:08.160\n But I think AI systems can probably have the same.\n\n1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:10.580\n But we would have to,\n\n1:29:10.580 --> 1:29:13.720\n as opposed to treating it as a one black box,\n\n1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:17.600\n it would have to be an artist that has a Twitter account,\n\n1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:19.640\n and they have a consistent personality,\n\n1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:21.560\n they have a consistent avatar.\n\n1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:22.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:23.280\n And I think down the line,\n\n1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.320\n have something like human rights.\n\n1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:27.820\n But then it really becomes awfully like a person.\n\n1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:31.160\n Oi, that's terrifying.\n\n1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:34.400\n As much as I dig dudes, it's terrifying, I hope.\n\n1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:36.280\n It's terrifying, like, you know,\n\n1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:38.280\n a lot of things that came with the internet\n\n1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:39.940\n and the digital age are terrifying.\n\n1:29:39.940 --> 1:29:41.840\n Porn is terrifying, the mass,\n\n1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:45.180\n like the amount of porn that's online now is terrifying.\n\n1:29:45.180 --> 1:29:48.080\n The, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar,\n\n1:29:48.080 --> 1:29:51.800\n I would compare it more to the leap from,\n\n1:29:51.800 --> 1:29:56.800\n to sort of to the Napster and the Spotifyzation of music,\n\n1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.940\n which is like, you have these,\n\n1:29:59.940 --> 1:30:01.440\n it's less about albums now,\n\n1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:03.120\n and it's more about individual songs,\n\n1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:05.660\n and it's much easier to deliver the songs.\n\n1:30:05.660 --> 1:30:09.160\n And it's more about sort of the engagement of the listener\n\n1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:11.640\n versus like signing the artist\n\n1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:14.100\n and like distribution of the artist and so on.\n\n1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:19.100\n So it's just changing the way we consume stuff.\n\n1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:24.320\n And human interaction is changing\n\n1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:26.920\n into meaningful interaction,\n\n1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.320\n even if some of the entities involved are not human.\n\n1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:34.980\n Yes, and I feel like, you know, now,\n\n1:30:34.980 --> 1:30:36.880\n like as I say, oh, I feel like grandpa\n\n1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:38.960\n who doesn't want to wait all day for,\n\n1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:43.960\n or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked potato as, anyway,\n\n1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:46.380\n Dana Carvey would say, it's another story.\n\n1:30:46.380 --> 1:30:50.960\n But, that's from, remember he did this bit\n\n1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:52.500\n on Saturday Night Live, where he's like,\n\n1:30:52.500 --> 1:30:57.080\n I'm an old man, and I like things the way they used to be.\n\n1:30:57.080 --> 1:31:00.080\n You know, like if you wanted a baked potato,\n\n1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.160\n you would have put it in the microwave, you had to,\n\n1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:04.400\n and then long story, uphill both ways\n\n1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:07.080\n and digging the potato and baking it all day in a fire.\n\n1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:10.280\n But I'm like that grandpa now,\n\n1:31:10.280 --> 1:31:12.880\n and I know that, you know, kids coming along,\n\n1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:14.200\n you see over the past 10 years,\n\n1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:16.960\n like babies literally knowing how to use an iPhone\n\n1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:18.240\n and it's terrifying.\n\n1:31:18.240 --> 1:31:20.840\n And I feel like I'm a little worried,\n\n1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:23.680\n because I'm like, are you, is the future,\n\n1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:26.040\n are the future generations gonna be able to understand\n\n1:31:26.040 --> 1:31:29.200\n that this is not, not that it's not real,\n\n1:31:29.200 --> 1:31:32.780\n it's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real,\n\n1:31:32.780 --> 1:31:35.000\n it's real, it's what you perceive.\n\n1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.600\n Perception is reality, and you know,\n\n1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:40.480\n 99% of reality in a lot of ways,\n\n1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:43.160\n especially in a digital world where everyone is now.\n\n1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:44.260\n And then with the metaverse,\n\n1:31:44.260 --> 1:31:45.880\n I don't even wanna think about it.\n\n1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:47.360\n I don't even, I don't get it.\n\n1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:49.480\n Really, truly.\n\n1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:51.120\n I think people will figure out,\n\n1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.160\n you see people on like on the train,\n\n1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:56.400\n public transit and so on, they're staring at their phone.\n\n1:31:57.980 --> 1:32:00.440\n I think, you have to remember that\n\n1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:01.760\n the reason they're staring at their phone,\n\n1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:02.680\n I mean, there's a lot of reasons,\n\n1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:04.640\n but one of the reasons is they're connecting\n\n1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:06.880\n with other human beings they love on that phone.\n\n1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.960\n So it is a source of happiness and joy.\n\n1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:12.000\n Now, social media has a lot of negative side effects\n\n1:32:12.920 --> 1:32:16.720\n that we're all talking about and learning about,\n\n1:32:16.720 --> 1:32:19.720\n and I think that means the next generation of social media,\n\n1:32:20.760 --> 1:32:22.260\n social networks will be better,\n\n1:32:22.260 --> 1:32:24.880\n and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way.\n\n1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:27.220\n We're just entering a new digital world\n\n1:32:27.220 --> 1:32:30.540\n that will keep the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff.\n\n1:32:30.540 --> 1:32:31.380\n Oh, I hope so.\n\n1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:32.600\n That's really optimistic.\n\n1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:34.160\n That sounds great.\n\n1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:37.520\n I mean it, because I think that we're in,\n\n1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:40.440\n we're clearly in the Wild West still of the internet,\n\n1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:43.020\n and just when you think you're out of it,\n\n1:32:43.020 --> 1:32:46.680\n the internet proves another way that it can be dangerous\n\n1:32:46.680 --> 1:32:51.680\n and detrimental to people and populations of people,\n\n1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.040\n and it's terrifying to me.\n\n1:32:55.040 --> 1:32:57.200\n It is, it's terrifying.\n\n1:32:57.200 --> 1:32:58.840\n Let me ask you a bunch of random questions.\n\n1:32:58.840 --> 1:32:59.680\n Okay. You ready?\n\n1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:00.520\n All right.\n\n1:33:01.720 --> 1:33:03.600\n If you can be someone else for a day,\n\n1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:07.400\n someone alive today, who would you be?\n\n1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:09.280\n Somebody you haven't met.\n\n1:33:09.280 --> 1:33:11.200\n Oh, that's a really good question.\n\n1:33:11.200 --> 1:33:12.020\n It could be dead.\n\n1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:13.320\n You know, I changed my mind.\n\n1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:14.480\n It could be somebody dead.\n\n1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:16.600\n I think any answer that I have right now\n\n1:33:16.600 --> 1:33:18.980\n would be something that would be based\n\n1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:21.220\n on some sort of experience.\n\n1:33:21.220 --> 1:33:23.920\n Like, you know what I thought was very interesting\n\n1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:25.820\n was last weekend or whatever,\n\n1:33:25.820 --> 1:33:27.960\n the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins.\n\n1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:30.760\n Taylor Hawkins was the drummer for the Foo Fighters,\n\n1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:32.820\n and he passed away tragically,\n\n1:33:32.820 --> 1:33:36.360\n and so the Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl,\n\n1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:38.040\n and everybody that got together at this concert.\n\n1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.840\n And you're watching Dave Grohl sing,\n\n1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:44.680\n try to sing times like these, right?\n\n1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:48.480\n And he's breaking up because he lost his friend, his brother.\n\n1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:53.480\n And I was watching that, and he's at Wembley Stadium.\n\n1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:56.600\n As I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him\n\n1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:00.860\n in that moment, but I am curious what that would be like.\n\n1:34:00.860 --> 1:34:03.480\n That's the ultimate, like having to perform\n\n1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:06.180\n despite something extremely human happening,\n\n1:34:06.180 --> 1:34:11.180\n and a stadium full of people that love Dave Grohl\n\n1:34:11.220 --> 1:34:15.580\n and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert\n\n1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:18.080\n and love these artists that they're getting to see\n\n1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:19.360\n up on stage.\n\n1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:21.680\n So much love and so much pain at the same time.\n\n1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:24.880\n I wonder what that would be like to be,\n\n1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:26.820\n I guess, and I think that's just sort of coming\n\n1:34:26.820 --> 1:34:29.520\n from the root of being a performer\n\n1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:31.400\n and being in front of that many.\n\n1:34:31.400 --> 1:34:34.560\n Have you ever had to perform while some rough stuff\n\n1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:37.480\n is going on in your personal life, just mentally?\n\n1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:38.800\n Yeah, sure.\n\n1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:39.800\n How tough is that?\n\n1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:44.560\n I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize.\n\n1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:49.880\n A lot of actors like to use some of their stuff\n\n1:34:49.880 --> 1:34:52.120\n if you're doing something that,\n\n1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.160\n and there's a lot of, there's some acting techniques\n\n1:34:55.160 --> 1:34:56.600\n that sort of.\n\n1:34:56.600 --> 1:34:57.520\n Channel it?\n\n1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:00.260\n Yeah, which I think is kind of,\n\n1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:03.880\n I don't know that that's, I don't know.\n\n1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:05.160\n For me, it's not really the thing,\n\n1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:08.680\n because I think if the writing is great,\n\n1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:12.800\n the writing is really good, you don't need to channel much.\n\n1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.260\n You need to invest in what's there,\n\n1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:19.560\n and what I've always loved about that illusion\n\n1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:22.280\n is really cracking a scene, getting it to a point\n\n1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:24.760\n where you are feeling all of it,\n\n1:35:24.760 --> 1:35:27.640\n and the most edifying stuff I've been a part of\n\n1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:31.420\n as an actor, and I would say that it mostly comes out\n\n1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:35.920\n of dramatic work, is when you're,\n\n1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:39.300\n when you actually feel the emotions\n\n1:35:39.300 --> 1:35:41.560\n that your character would feel, truly,\n\n1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:43.840\n and it's not because you're pulling from a tragic thing\n\n1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.080\n that happened, or a lost loved one,\n\n1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:48.400\n or a lost love, or any of that.\n\n1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:51.760\n I just did this one movie where we're doing the thing,\n\n1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:54.360\n and it was a wonderful cast, and a great film,\n\n1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:58.400\n and I'm giving a speech at a wedding,\n\n1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:01.440\n and it really got to us.\n\n1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:03.560\n Like, it got to me, and then one of the other actors\n\n1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:08.560\n came up and hugged me, in the characters that we were,\n\n1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:10.600\n but the stakes of his character,\n\n1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.760\n and what he's walked into, and the family\n\n1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:17.400\n that he's marrying into, and what my character,\n\n1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:21.160\n my character's wife, want for my wife's sister,\n\n1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:24.320\n and this whole thing, and it all became very real.\n\n1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.320\n That was a set where the director showed up\n\n1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:29.320\n to set every day, making sure that emotionally,\n\n1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:31.180\n and it was a very dramatic film,\n\n1:36:31.180 --> 1:36:32.440\n making sure that emotionally,\n\n1:36:32.440 --> 1:36:34.400\n the table was set for his actors.\n\n1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:37.720\n Great crew, and a really nice, tight, little,\n\n1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:40.520\n quick family, as a lot of these movies are.\n\n1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:42.600\n You really love working with these people,\n\n1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:47.600\n and then it's over, but I, that's when you feel the drug.\n\n1:36:48.020 --> 1:36:49.440\n Like, it's like when you're golfing,\n\n1:36:49.440 --> 1:36:52.040\n and you, and it's on the green,\n\n1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.480\n you're like, oh, I get it now.\n\n1:36:53.480 --> 1:36:57.360\n So in the words, you can find the emotion,\n\n1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:58.960\n the words summon the emotion.\n\n1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.080\n The humanity's right there.\n\n1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:01.120\n If you read a great script,\n\n1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:03.200\n you're gonna sob in your living room.\n\n1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:05.960\n You know what the saddest, the toughest thing\n\n1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:09.720\n about being an actor is from my totally outside perspective,\n\n1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:12.680\n is from the people I've interacted with,\n\n1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.020\n is how intimate that process is\n\n1:37:16.020 --> 1:37:18.120\n between the group of people that create a thing,\n\n1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:21.820\n that's a movie, and then you move on to the next thing.\n\n1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.080\n It's almost, it's like, I don't know,\n\n1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:27.200\n I mean, that's why people have relationships on set.\n\n1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:28.200\n They get, they fall in love.\n\n1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:29.200\n Totally.\n\n1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:30.200\n It's so sad.\n\n1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:32.840\n I mean, like, that's why I think of the acting world\n\n1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:36.480\n as like, you fall in love with each other, essentially.\n\n1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:38.480\n You become close friends, then you move on,\n\n1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:40.600\n because that's kind of the process of career.\n\n1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:42.120\n You know, like the example I just gave,\n\n1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:43.120\n if you're doing it right, yeah,\n\n1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:45.580\n there is a certain amount of that happening,\n\n1:37:45.580 --> 1:37:47.620\n but I do still feel like you can,\n\n1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:50.600\n you gotta compartmentalize it,\n\n1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:52.600\n and you've gotta be able to wash it off\n\n1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:53.560\n as soon as it's over.\n\n1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:56.280\n Prostitutes say the same thing, so I,\n\n1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:57.800\n it's where I try.\n\n1:37:57.800 --> 1:38:02.800\n Look, sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody,\n\n1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:06.280\n because it's been very emotional,\n\n1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:09.560\n and with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome,\n\n1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:12.880\n but you get pretty good at saying goodbye\n\n1:38:12.880 --> 1:38:14.920\n and being like, I'll see ya if I see ya.\n\n1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:18.480\n You have to get good at that, or else you'll never,\n\n1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:20.720\n you'll just be bent up all the time.\n\n1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:23.200\n I saw an actor once, we were doing this series,\n\n1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:27.200\n and we did it for a year, and it was a lot of fun,\n\n1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:28.440\n and it was a tight little group,\n\n1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:29.920\n and then one of the actors,\n\n1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:32.140\n we were doing one of our last things together.\n\n1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:33.600\n We had already shot the last show,\n\n1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.800\n and we just had to take some pictures for,\n\n1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:39.040\n you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever.\n\n1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:41.640\n So we're set up, and we're taking our pictures together,\n\n1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:43.540\n and then we move into these single shots,\n\n1:38:43.540 --> 1:38:46.880\n and this actor was finished, and I watched them.\n\n1:38:46.880 --> 1:38:48.920\n It's like, okay, so and so's wrapped,\n\n1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:51.200\n and they said some goodbyes and stuff,\n\n1:38:51.200 --> 1:38:53.000\n and I didn't say my goodbye,\n\n1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.920\n because maybe I preferred an Irish goodbye.\n\n1:38:56.920 --> 1:38:59.400\n I feel like we've said everything, you know what I mean?\n\n1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:01.060\n And this person knows that I revere them,\n\n1:39:01.060 --> 1:39:03.400\n and they're an idol of mine,\n\n1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:07.520\n and they walked off the sound stage,\n\n1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:10.280\n and I literally thought to myself,\n\n1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:12.280\n that'll be the last time I see that person,\n\n1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:14.700\n and the show did not come back,\n\n1:39:14.700 --> 1:39:16.640\n and that was the last time I'll see them around.\n\n1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:18.480\n Doesn't that just break your heart?\n\n1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:23.480\n A little bit, but I know what she's going back to,\n\n1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:25.160\n which is her family,\n\n1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:27.560\n and that's more important than all of this,\n\n1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:31.460\n and that's the thing about a TV family or a movie family,\n\n1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:34.680\n when you get together and you're a family for a while,\n\n1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:37.420\n you are, you spend your days together.\n\n1:39:37.420 --> 1:39:39.240\n A lot of times, you see the people that you work with\n\n1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:40.860\n more than you see your loved ones,\n\n1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:43.120\n so in showbiz, it's no different, right?\n\n1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:44.920\n And yeah, you're doing some, you know,\n\n1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:46.520\n you gotta say words, and every once in a while,\n\n1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:48.840\n you gotta kiss someone or pretend you love them,\n\n1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:53.840\n but it's just, it underscores how, for me,\n\n1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:58.040\n look, man, my salvation has always been,\n\n1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:00.800\n and I feel so fortunate to have had it,\n\n1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.800\n is this kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing\n\n1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:08.600\n that I want for my kids someday,\n\n1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.360\n and I can't wait to get back to my house\n\n1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:15.140\n with my fiance and the dogs, you know,\n\n1:40:15.140 --> 1:40:16.680\n until we have kids.\n\n1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:19.080\n Live in a cabin in Canada somewhere.\n\n1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:23.160\n Absolutely, I just wanna buy some land over an aquifer,\n\n1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:25.800\n as I like to say, because water will be the new money,\n\n1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:30.200\n and just make sure that all my kids are drinking\n\n1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:33.600\n as much H2O as I am, which is a lot.\n\n1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.840\n I'm peeing right now, as a matter of fact.\n\n1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.800\n Do you need a bathroom?\n\n1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:38.620\n No, no, no, I got it.\n\n1:40:38.620 --> 1:40:39.460\n Not anymore?\n\n1:40:39.460 --> 1:40:40.960\n No, I'm wearing two layers, it depends, don't worry about it.\n\n1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:44.880\n Good, so I did a podcast with Bobby Lee\n\n1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:48.340\n and he said, he was extremely kind,\n\n1:40:48.340 --> 1:40:51.080\n and he said that he was scared shitless\n\n1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:55.480\n to be on the podcast, and he actually literally took,\n\n1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:58.440\n he asked as the first thing to go take a dump\n\n1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:00.320\n because of how scared he was.\n\n1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.520\n So that leads me to a question,\n\n1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:03.720\n what's the scariest thing you've ever done?\n\n1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:07.500\n Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been\n\n1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:08.800\n before a performance?\n\n1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:13.320\n I mean, I always get a little nervous.\n\n1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:16.160\n I think you're doing it right if you're still nervous.\n\n1:41:16.160 --> 1:41:17.360\n Were you nervous today?\n\n1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.260\n Well, no, man, because this isn't a performance.\n\n1:41:20.260 --> 1:41:22.400\n I'm being completely genuine.\n\n1:41:22.400 --> 1:41:23.860\n You're wearing a suit.\n\n1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:24.700\n Yeah, that was.\n\n1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:26.480\n I feel like that makes you nervous.\n\n1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:27.320\n Wearing a suit?\n\n1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:28.160\n It makes me nervous.\n\n1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:29.600\n Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar.\n\n1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:30.920\n If you're watching this on YouTube,\n\n1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:33.640\n you can see me just, I'm constantly doing,\n\n1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:36.280\n it's like I'm doing a cheap Rodney Dangerfield,\n\n1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:37.120\n but I am truly.\n\n1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:39.080\n But when you move your head, it kind of makes it seem\n\n1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:42.720\n like you're a mobster who's pissed off a little bit.\n\n1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:46.040\n You fucking crossed me one last time, you son of a.\n\n1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:49.480\n You know, this mutt, I think it's the first time\n\n1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:53.360\n I've fucking dug a hole, I'll dig a fucking hole, Jesus.\n\n1:41:53.360 --> 1:41:55.920\n No, but truly, I hate having a collar.\n\n1:41:55.920 --> 1:41:59.440\n I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin\n\n1:41:59.440 --> 1:42:02.540\n or nothing at all, walk around Bobby Lee style.\n\n1:42:02.540 --> 1:42:05.760\n The most scared I've been before a performance,\n\n1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:09.640\n I can't pinpoint anything.\n\n1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:12.760\n I, you know, when I was a kid, right?\n\n1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:15.960\n I, like I said, I was fortunate enough to start acting\n\n1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:18.520\n as a teen and stuff professionally.\n\n1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:20.580\n And I just remember my first gig.\n\n1:42:20.580 --> 1:42:23.880\n And I remember saying my handful of lines\n\n1:42:23.880 --> 1:42:26.680\n in the bathroom mirror the night before going,\n\n1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:30.100\n this might be my only fucking shot.\n\n1:42:30.100 --> 1:42:33.420\n You're not gonna get me, I'm gonna be solid.\n\n1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:37.680\n And if I'm worried about something,\n\n1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:40.320\n I will rehearse it and rehearse it and rehearse it\n\n1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:43.360\n as an actor until it's impossible for me\n\n1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:48.360\n not to get a take at least that I'm 100%,\n\n1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:52.120\n if not 95, maybe percent happy with.\n\n1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:54.200\n And the rest for me is letting go, which is hard\n\n1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:56.880\n because I can be a real perfectionist.\n\n1:42:56.880 --> 1:42:58.600\n I always want another,\n\n1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:00.560\n I always wanna do it a little better.\n\n1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:01.920\n That's what's great about podcasting.\n\n1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:05.260\n This is one take and you're done, there's no takes.\n\n1:43:05.260 --> 1:43:07.240\n You're just talking and then it's over.\n\n1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:09.600\n And you're doing some silly stuff.\n\n1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:11.720\n And I'll, you know.\n\n1:43:11.720 --> 1:43:14.520\n Can you say that part again about why podcasting is great?\n\n1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:15.440\n Podcasting is great?\n\n1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:17.060\n Yeah, because it's one take and it's over.\n\n1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:20.440\n It's just, what, I said it again?\n\n1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:21.280\n Ah, fuck.\n\n1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:23.800\n I see what you did.\n\n1:43:23.800 --> 1:43:25.840\n And yeah, I fell right for it.\n\n1:43:25.840 --> 1:43:27.880\n I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.\n\n1:43:27.880 --> 1:43:29.720\n That's your problem.\n\n1:43:29.720 --> 1:43:32.560\n You know, but still when we do the podcast,\n\n1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:34.000\n we'll like finish and I'll look over at Chad\n\n1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.080\n and I go, that one thing that I did wasn't that funny.\n\n1:43:37.080 --> 1:43:38.360\n I was like, shut up, man.\n\n1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.120\n Just, it doesn't matter.\n\n1:43:40.120 --> 1:43:41.400\n It's a fucking hang.\n\n1:43:41.400 --> 1:43:43.840\n We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there.\n\n1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:44.840\n That's what we're doing.\n\n1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:46.600\n So that anxiety is there.\n\n1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:49.360\n That self criticism or whatever that is, that voice.\n\n1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:51.120\n I say sorry after takes.\n\n1:43:51.120 --> 1:43:53.320\n I'll always finish a take and go.\n\n1:43:53.320 --> 1:43:56.320\n And I've had directors, to the detriment of myself,\n\n1:43:56.320 --> 1:43:59.440\n I've had directors be like, stop doing that.\n\n1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:00.400\n Because I'll like finish the take\n\n1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:02.840\n and then I also have like the will phase.\n\n1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:06.000\n When I'm just like, I'll finish the take and cut.\n\n1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.160\n And I'm making a face right now, like I smelled something.\n\n1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.280\n That's what I'll do.\n\n1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:13.360\n I'll literally be like, ah, cause I just,\n\n1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:18.360\n I look at what I do in the purest sense as,\n\n1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.440\n I think a lot of people wanna be good at something.\n\n1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:30.120\n I've only, the only thing I've ever really wanted\n\n1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:33.880\n to be good at is being an actor.\n\n1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:37.120\n And that's the only thing,\n\n1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:38.640\n of course I wanna be a good person.\n\n1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:41.360\n I wanna be a good partner to my fiance.\n\n1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:45.640\n I wanna have kids and be the father that I had.\n\n1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:48.760\n And I wanna be the parent that I had from my parents\n\n1:44:48.760 --> 1:44:51.680\n who were fucking amazing, wonderful people.\n\n1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:53.520\n And there's all those things.\n\n1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:56.240\n That's all, you know, you should want all those things.\n\n1:44:56.240 --> 1:45:00.600\n But as far as doing a thing, like what is my trade?\n\n1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:04.760\n You know, I wanna be really good at it.\n\n1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:08.240\n My parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right?\n\n1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.520\n And I say Napoli, cause I'm Italian.\n\n1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:13.600\n And so my grandfather on my mom's side, my nonopepe,\n\n1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:18.400\n he was a plumber and he was also like a handyman.\n\n1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:20.160\n Like people would bring him like,\n\n1:45:20.160 --> 1:45:21.560\n you know like the old Chianti bottle\n\n1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:24.320\n with like with the woven bottom part.\n\n1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:26.440\n People would bring him like a broken bottle,\n\n1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.080\n be like, hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this?\n\n1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:29.920\n And he'd be saying,\n\n1:45:29.920 --> 1:45:31.600\n if you're telling the backstory of Mario,\n\n1:45:31.600 --> 1:45:33.200\n that's not actually your family life.\n\n1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:34.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:34.880\n But okay.\n\n1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:35.720\n He said I'm a fix.\n\n1:45:35.720 --> 1:45:36.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:37.440\n And so Giuseppe, what?\n\n1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:40.240\n He would fix a bottle and give it back to someone.\n\n1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:43.320\n And he was a really good plumber.\n\n1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:45.600\n My mom used to always say that guy was an amazing,\n\n1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:46.680\n he was a great.\n\n1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:47.560\n He took pride in that?\n\n1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:48.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:48.400 --> 1:45:50.340\n I always feel like, you know,\n\n1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:53.560\n there's what you set out to do\n\n1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:55.480\n as an idealistic little teenager.\n\n1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:57.240\n I wanna be like so and so,\n\n1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.360\n and I wanna, you know, hear my big dreams and stuff.\n\n1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:02.960\n And I can't believe that I'm still in the business.\n\n1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:03.800\n Okay.\n\n1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:06.480\n That's, first of all, let me say that right now.\n\n1:46:06.480 --> 1:46:08.400\n I can't believe it.\n\n1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:13.200\n But what I really, it's the one thing that it's like,\n\n1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:15.160\n I can't give up on a take.\n\n1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:18.560\n You know, I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it.\n\n1:46:18.560 --> 1:46:21.200\n And I don't really know why that is\n\n1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:24.400\n outside of wanting to be good at something.\n\n1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:27.360\n When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber,\n\n1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:30.280\n I'm not, you know, I'm not Roto Rooter.\n\n1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:32.760\n Like I'm not the guy with the big full page ad,\n\n1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:36.760\n but I'm also not, you know, triple A abacus brothers\n\n1:46:36.760 --> 1:46:39.120\n or whatever, like the shitty one.\n\n1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:42.160\n I would like to hope that just,\n\n1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:44.640\n and I'm saying this with pride for what I do.\n\n1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:46.400\n I'm not trying to say here's my standing\n\n1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:48.480\n or where I wanna be in the fucking business.\n\n1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:49.880\n That's not what I mean.\n\n1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:51.560\n I mean that I wanna be good at it.\n\n1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:52.720\n You know, we all, hello?\n\n1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:55.200\n I'm in Friedman Enterprises.\n\n1:46:56.160 --> 1:46:57.440\n So that's the hotel phone.\n\n1:46:59.440 --> 1:47:00.280\n Come on.\n\n1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:03.280\n Hello?\n\n1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:06.760\n Hello?\n\n1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.080\n You got some fruit?\n\n1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:12.800\n Some sliced fruit?\n\n1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:14.280\n No, do you want some sliced fruit?\n\n1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:15.120\n I'm all good.\n\n1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:17.120\n No, we're good, thank you so much.\n\n1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:18.400\n All right, bye bye.\n\n1:47:18.400 --> 1:47:19.720\n It's always a fruit plate.\n\n1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:22.680\n Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate\n\n1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:23.520\n in life, you know?\n\n1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:24.360\n It's a pretty sweet existence.\n\n1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:26.440\n Wouldn't it be funny if that was actually like the CIA\n\n1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:28.000\n and they were actually saying something else\n\n1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.080\n and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about,\n\n1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:31.080\n you want some fruit?\n\n1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:32.080\n You want some fruit?\n\n1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:33.920\n And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head\n\n1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:35.440\n and the ceiling disappears.\n\n1:47:35.440 --> 1:47:38.640\n And the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.\n\n1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:40.240\n Wrap it up.\n\n1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:43.440\n You jump out the window and there's a helicopter waiting.\n\n1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:45.200\n Oh, what were we talking about?\n\n1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:46.200\n The fruit distracted me.\n\n1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:50.840\n So, oh, the, do you wanna be the yellow page ad?\n\n1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:54.520\n I wanna be the guy on the second or third page\n\n1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:56.920\n where it's like, you're not gonna pay\n\n1:47:56.920 --> 1:47:58.000\n what that guy charges you,\n\n1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.040\n but I'm not gonna charge you what this loser charges.\n\n1:48:02.040 --> 1:48:05.160\n I wanna break down the middle and the work is guaranteed.\n\n1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:07.600\n That's kind of what I wanna,\n\n1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:10.920\n it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough\n\n1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:15.360\n to be doing my whole life and that I wanna be good at.\n\n1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:16.680\n Everyone wants to be good at something.\n\n1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:19.240\n If you're fortunate enough to be able to do\n\n1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:22.160\n what you love as a job, I mean, my God, I'm so,\n\n1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:25.240\n again, I can't believe I get to do it.\n\n1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:29.160\n I just wanna be good at it so that I can fucking die someday\n\n1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:30.920\n and go, eh.\n\n1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:34.000\n I tried not to give up on a take and I,\n\n1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.040\n and I will rehearse it still in the bathroom mirror\n\n1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:39.320\n the night before if I have to.\n\n1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:41.680\n Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice.\n\n1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:45.560\n I just, after every podcast, after this podcast,\n\n1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:48.120\n I'll probably be like, you're boring.\n\n1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:49.120\n Why are you so boring?\n\n1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:50.760\n That, that, that, that, that, that, that.\n\n1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:53.080\n And I just gave a lecture at MIT.\n\n1:48:53.080 --> 1:48:56.840\n I was like, I get so much love from people.\n\n1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:59.080\n They're such beautiful people.\n\n1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:00.720\n And I just remember walking home,\n\n1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:07.080\n just feeling like I wasted everybody's time, you know?\n\n1:49:07.080 --> 1:49:09.360\n And I don't know what that is.\n\n1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:11.760\n I don't, you know, I do hope that that's a voice\n\n1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:14.960\n that won't destroy me, you know, like every time.\n\n1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:16.880\n That's really human of you to admit that\n\n1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:20.240\n because people don't wanna, they wouldn't assume that,\n\n1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:22.600\n of course, from you or anything that, I mean,\n\n1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:26.440\n you've got a large group of students in there\n\n1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:28.160\n listening to you and feeling the way\n\n1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:29.960\n and thinking what they think of you.\n\n1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:34.120\n So that's really interesting to hear you admit that,\n\n1:49:34.120 --> 1:49:36.600\n but it's also, I would expect nothing else.\n\n1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:39.120\n You have to be able to, it's such a,\n\n1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:40.560\n I mean, you're a human fucking being.\n\n1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:43.400\n And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know,\n\n1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:45.040\n some people that might hear that, they would say,\n\n1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:47.160\n well, that's a problem you have to fix.\n\n1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:51.360\n And I think that that might be just who I am.\n\n1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:53.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:55.680\n Because I'm not, you know, I've been very, very fortunate\n\n1:49:55.680 --> 1:49:59.720\n not to have chemical, you know, like depression\n\n1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:01.480\n where I get into a dark place.\n\n1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:04.400\n I could get stuck in a downward spiral.\n\n1:50:04.400 --> 1:50:06.760\n It's usually a thing that lasts.\n\n1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:10.360\n You ride it out and then after a good night's sleep,\n\n1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:13.600\n you're back to your happy self.\n\n1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:17.880\n So I think I have to try to figure that out.\n\n1:50:17.880 --> 1:50:19.560\n Is that just part of the creative process,\n\n1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:21.880\n being a creative human in this world?\n\n1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:23.480\n I haven't found any other way.\n\n1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:24.640\n I'm always kicking myself.\n\n1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:29.640\n Take that, dude, so you can't, you're not gonna be human\n\n1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:30.960\n until you feel some despair.\n\n1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:33.360\n Yeah, until you absolutely hate the shit\n\n1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:34.760\n that you're doing sometimes.\n\n1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:39.160\n What small act of kindness were you once shown\n\n1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:40.880\n that you will never forget?\n\n1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:42.800\n Do you, does something jump to mind\n\n1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:46.280\n where somebody just did something that made you smile?\n\n1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:51.240\n Did you feel connected to the rest of humanity?\n\n1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:56.480\n Yeah, yeah, lots of things, you know?\n\n1:50:57.640 --> 1:51:00.280\n But I remember my niece one time,\n\n1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:04.480\n one of my nieces, we were in her neighborhood\n\n1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:09.280\n and she was like, she might've been five or six at the time.\n\n1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:10.560\n They're all adults now.\n\n1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.200\n My brother and sister are older than me\n\n1:51:12.200 --> 1:51:15.120\n and the kids are all, the youngest is 22.\n\n1:51:15.120 --> 1:51:17.560\n And yeah, anyway, one of my nieces,\n\n1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:18.960\n she was just, she had ice cream.\n\n1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.120\n We went out and we got ice cream\n\n1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.200\n walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood.\n\n1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:25.560\n And she said something to me that I don't think\n\n1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:27.600\n she understands how much it meant at the time,\n\n1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:30.440\n but she goes, she goes, people love you here.\n\n1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.360\n You know that?\n\n1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.120\n And she doesn't know where here is.\n\n1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:35.360\n She's five years old, but she was just looking\n\n1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:36.840\n at the kids playing in the park\n\n1:51:36.840 --> 1:51:38.320\n and the people walking their dogs\n\n1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:41.280\n and everyone just, people love you here, you know that?\n\n1:51:41.280 --> 1:51:43.360\n But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that\n\n1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:45.960\n at that point, which is really heavy for me.\n\n1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:47.040\n I'll never forget it.\n\n1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:48.360\n I've never told her that.\n\n1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:52.320\n Oh, well, man, anytime you get a little something\n\n1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:55.520\n from people, especially in a tear your ass out city\n\n1:51:55.520 --> 1:51:58.640\n like LA where nobody has any fucking time for you,\n\n1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:02.720\n when someone can slow it down and say something, you know?\n\n1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:07.920\n I saw this actor once in my grocery store that I go to\n\n1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:10.960\n who made me laugh so fucking hard in this one movie\n\n1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:13.440\n and every time I see this clip, I still laugh.\n\n1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:17.240\n And I am kind of shy, you know, personally,\n\n1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:20.600\n but so he was walking by, he was walking out\n\n1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:23.040\n and I was walking in and I go, oh, that's that guy.\n\n1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:27.440\n And I did not stop to just let him know\n\n1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:29.280\n how great I thought he was in this film.\n\n1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:31.120\n And I always kind of regretted it.\n\n1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:31.960\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:35.040\n So as hard as it is, and sometimes I still don't,\n\n1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:39.240\n if I see someone that has done something in any way,\n\n1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:42.760\n it doesn't have to be in show business or anything like that.\n\n1:52:42.760 --> 1:52:46.320\n I'll try and say, hey, that's really good.\n\n1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:47.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:53.720\n Because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know?\n\n1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:55.440\n It can mean a lot.\n\n1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:57.360\n At a certain time in life when you need it.\n\n1:52:57.360 --> 1:52:58.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.560\n That can make a big difference.\n\n1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:03.440\n I mean, sorry to take it back to my new girlfriend,\n\n1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:04.280\n the waitress.\n\n1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:05.120\n Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:08.320\n But there's something about her saying sweetheart.\n\n1:53:08.320 --> 1:53:09.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:11.520\n It's a pretty low place for some reason mentally.\n\n1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:14.840\n And it's just that basic human kindness was nice.\n\n1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:16.480\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:17.320\n I hear you.\n\n1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:21.080\n I was at a restaurant in New York recently\n\n1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:22.280\n and I was shooting something\n\n1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:25.040\n and my fiance was able to fly in for a week.\n\n1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:27.880\n And she was back at the hotel\n\n1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:29.440\n and it's like I felt like I was cheating on her\n\n1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:31.280\n because there was this nice waitress\n\n1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:33.240\n at this barbecue place I went to.\n\n1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:35.480\n And first of all, my fiance would not like me\n\n1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:37.600\n eating any greasy, sugary barbecue.\n\n1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:39.200\n So I felt like I was cheating on her there.\n\n1:53:39.200 --> 1:53:42.280\n We'll edit this out and put delicious vegan food over it.\n\n1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:44.680\n But the waitress was one of these,\n\n1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:47.520\n she was the kind of server who's like,\n\n1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:49.680\n hey hun, hey sweetie, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:52.960\n But like so chill and at ease\n\n1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:54.520\n in the middle of a part of New York\n\n1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:59.520\n that's really kind of fucking pretentious and everybody.\n\n1:53:59.520 --> 1:54:02.960\n But sweet people, fucking way better people\n\n1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:03.800\n than we got here.\n\n1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:07.080\n But I know that.\n\n1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:09.200\n But it was part of New York and whatever,\n\n1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:10.720\n I'm there working and people,\n\n1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:12.800\n I'm like, I'm trying to impress one another.\n\n1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:15.760\n And she even had some sort of an accent\n\n1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:20.020\n that didn't feel like an Atlantic American accent.\n\n1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:26.280\n Yeah, those servers that say sweetheart and hun,\n\n1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:27.960\n that's what we need from AI.\n\n1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:30.400\n We need that Jetson server.\n\n1:54:30.400 --> 1:54:33.240\n Every once in a while just calls you sweetheart.\n\n1:54:33.240 --> 1:54:36.160\n What comforts you on bad days?\n\n1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:37.000\n Oh man.\n\n1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.440\n Is there little sources of comfort?\n\n1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:43.120\n Small things they do that kind of make you feel good.\n\n1:54:43.120 --> 1:54:45.880\n Like for Bobby, that'd be a little Skyrim.\n\n1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:48.720\n A little stroll through Skyrim.\n\n1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:51.560\n Well, I've been a line of coke or what?\n\n1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:52.760\n Yeah, a line of coke.\n\n1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:54.920\n I dilute some coke into whiskey in the morning\n\n1:54:54.920 --> 1:54:56.440\n like Stevie Ray Vaughan.\n\n1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:57.280\n And then I snort the whiskey.\n\n1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:58.120\n Oh, she did that, I didn't know that.\n\n1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:00.080\n Yeah, yeah, oh my gosh, interesting.\n\n1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:02.200\n Yeah, he didn't last too long, weird.\n\n1:55:02.200 --> 1:55:04.480\n Well, his music will last forever.\n\n1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:06.040\n See, there you go.\n\n1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:10.760\n For me, if I, I'm kind of a homebody.\n\n1:55:10.760 --> 1:55:15.760\n So if I, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot\n\n1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:21.040\n and then go like lay down on the couch\n\n1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:26.040\n and perhaps if my fiancee's kind of nodding off\n\n1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:27.960\n or she's just like looking at her phone\n\n1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:30.880\n and I sneakily turn on some wrestling, okay?\n\n1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:32.560\n Because I grew up watching wrestling\n\n1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:35.080\n and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect.\n\n1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:37.800\n I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape.\n\n1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:40.000\n This stuff makes no sense in the world.\n\n1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.840\n It's an art form that is so uniquely weird,\n\n1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.840\n but at the same time, so everyone, when it's good,\n\n1:55:49.520 --> 1:55:54.000\n everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience.\n\n1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.960\n They cheer the good guys, they boo the bad guys.\n\n1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:58.080\n So if I'm like that,\n\n1:55:58.080 --> 1:56:00.360\n and then I got our two cute little dogs there\n\n1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:02.240\n and I'm annoying my little dog Lulio\n\n1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:05.000\n and trying to kiss him right on the fucking mouth\n\n1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:06.120\n and I've had a little bit of pot\n\n1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:09.240\n and the dog's like, stop, pot's not good for me.\n\n1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:11.360\n Of course, don't ever blow pot in your dog's face.\n\n1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:13.680\n That's a small comfort.\n\n1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:15.600\n I guess that's a handful of things.\n\n1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:19.120\n No, that moment painted, that was like a little painting.\n\n1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:19.960\n What about you?\n\n1:56:24.480 --> 1:56:25.720\n You're not supposed to do this.\n\n1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:26.560\n I will.\n\n1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.480\n You're not supposed to do this.\n\n1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:29.880\n That's a good question.\n\n1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:32.200\n Yeah, it's a tough question.\n\n1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:39.360\n I would say programming robots.\n\n1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:43.600\n There's bringing to life, actually programming at all.\n\n1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:47.000\n So I don't know how familiar you are with programming,\n\n1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:52.000\n but you write some text on a page, right, on a screen\n\n1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:56.440\n and it's brought to life, like it does something.\n\n1:56:56.440 --> 1:57:01.400\n And that's kind of, that's a really tiny version\n\n1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:03.720\n of maybe having a child.\n\n1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:07.600\n Like you created something that is now living\n\n1:57:08.480 --> 1:57:11.400\n in some smaller big way with embodied robots\n\n1:57:11.400 --> 1:57:14.920\n that are legged robots, that's especially clear.\n\n1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:19.320\n And for some reason, that's a source of comfort for me,\n\n1:57:19.320 --> 1:57:22.640\n that the power of programming,\n\n1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:25.320\n but also the elegance of programming, just the whole thing.\n\n1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:29.040\n It's a source of happiness.\n\n1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:31.200\n There's so many things I've been very blessed\n\n1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:34.120\n with enjoying anything.\n\n1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:36.360\n Like that's part of the struggle I have in life\n\n1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.440\n is that the simple stuff is a source\n\n1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:40.000\n of a lot of happiness for me,\n\n1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.440\n which leads to a lot of laziness.\n\n1:57:42.440 --> 1:57:45.840\n So I have to like give myself artificial deadlines.\n\n1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:48.160\n I have to be freaking out on purpose\n\n1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:50.920\n in order to be productive in this world at all.\n\n1:57:50.920 --> 1:57:53.920\n You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy.\n\n1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:54.760\n No.\n\n1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.520\n No, I am, but because I'm constantly creating\n\n1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:02.520\n artificial stress and deadlines and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:05.520\n Otherwise, I would just sit there looking at a tree happy.\n\n1:58:05.520 --> 1:58:08.640\n I'm truly happy with everything.\n\n1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:09.800\n That's awesome.\n\n1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:10.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.880\n Gee whiz, that's not.\n\n1:58:12.880 --> 1:58:15.920\n Well, that's the line of Coke in the whiskey in the morning.\n\n1:58:15.920 --> 1:58:18.520\n That's the thing that does the trick.\n\n1:58:18.520 --> 1:58:21.000\n TV Ray Vaughan breakfast shake.\n\n1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.120\n By the way, one of my most favorite guitars.\n\n1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:24.600\n I play guitar too, that's a source of comfort.\n\n1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:27.000\n Oh yeah, I have seen you play some guitar, that's awesome.\n\n1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000\n Who's the greatest wrestler of all time?\n\n1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:30.760\n Greatest in ring performer of all time\n\n1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:32.200\n is Bret the Hitman Hart.\n\n1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:33.880\n What's the difference in ring versus?\n\n1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:36.960\n Well, there's many facets to the art form.\n\n1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:39.320\n A lot of people are great on the mic,\n\n1:58:39.320 --> 1:58:41.800\n but they're not so great once they get in the ring.\n\n1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.960\n A lot of people have all the showmanship and stuff,\n\n1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:48.600\n but then they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package,\n\n1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:50.640\n but then they get to the ring or they open their mouth\n\n1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:52.000\n and there's nothing going on.\n\n1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:53.800\n So who's the greatest in ring performer?\n\n1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:56.120\n I think the greatest in ring is Bret Hart.\n\n1:58:56.120 --> 1:58:57.360\n I don't think there's anyone better\n\n1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:59.560\n than Bret the Hitman Hart.\n\n1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:02.800\n What makes him so good?\n\n1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:03.640\n Well, he...\n\n1:59:03.640 --> 1:59:06.720\n I think I had an action figure of him in Russia\n\n1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:08.280\n and we didn't know what the hell that was.\n\n1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:10.480\n Sure, yeah, it was just a guy in pink tights.\n\n1:59:11.720 --> 1:59:12.640\n Everything makes sense.\n\n1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:15.040\n Every single thing is rooted in the thing\n\n1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:18.040\n that just happened and everything that he does\n\n1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:21.040\n is to set up what he's going to do.\n\n1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:22.960\n They call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd,\n\n1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:25.680\n but the wrestlers, I guess, call it ring psychology.\n\n1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:29.280\n The things that you have to do to make it seem\n\n1:59:29.280 --> 1:59:32.120\n like you're suffering or you're coming from behind\n\n1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:34.320\n or whatever, and then also just the physicality of it.\n\n1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:35.160\n He does it at a...\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:38.160\n He would do it at a 100 miles an hour\n\n1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:40.160\n and never hurt anybody.\n\n1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:41.000\n Although,\n\n1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:45.760\n I also love the every...\n\n1:59:45.760 --> 1:59:47.960\n The greatest wrestler of all time, everyone says,\n\n1:59:47.960 --> 1:59:51.960\n and they're right, is Ric Flair, nature boy, Ric Flair.\n\n1:59:51.960 --> 1:59:53.080\n Everyone says this?\n\n1:59:53.080 --> 1:59:56.280\n Yeah, I think if you know what you're talking about.\n\n1:59:56.280 --> 1:59:57.600\n Because he's the best on the mic,\n\n1:59:57.600 --> 2:00:00.400\n he's also incredible in the ring.\n\n2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:02.160\n And then for me, the sentimental favorite,\n\n2:00:02.160 --> 2:00:04.160\n which we've actually, on DudeZ,\n\n2:00:04.160 --> 2:00:08.680\n Chad had sort of a Charlie Rose ask interview with me\n\n2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:11.200\n about this, my fascination with Hulk Hogan.\n\n2:00:11.200 --> 2:00:13.080\n Because to me, just he was Superman.\n\n2:00:13.080 --> 2:00:16.240\n I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted.\n\n2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:18.200\n But yeah, see, this is like asking me\n\n2:00:18.200 --> 2:00:20.200\n who my favorite child is.\n\n2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:21.440\n Right, so...\n\n2:00:21.440 --> 2:00:23.400\n The rock when the rock was...\n\n2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:25.480\n I mean, the rock's the rock.\n\n2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:27.280\n Yeah, I mean, Hulk Hogan is...\n\n2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:31.080\n He's the weirdest one, right?\n\n2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:32.640\n For me, from the outside.\n\n2:00:32.640 --> 2:00:34.040\n Super weird.\n\n2:00:34.040 --> 2:00:35.000\n That...\n\n2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.640\n I don't know what that is exactly.\n\n2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:38.920\n Everything's weird about him.\n\n2:00:38.920 --> 2:00:39.760\n Yeah.\n\n2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:40.640\n He's got the bald head,\n\n2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:44.840\n like he would proudly have this bald head with long hair,\n\n2:00:44.840 --> 2:00:46.400\n the handlebar mustache,\n\n2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:49.920\n and this ketchup and mustard tights,\n\n2:00:49.920 --> 2:00:52.960\n which he says he credits McDonald's with the tights.\n\n2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:54.080\n He literally does?\n\n2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:57.960\n He says that the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo,\n\n2:00:57.960 --> 2:01:01.720\n who's Randy Macho Man Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad,\n\n2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:03.960\n who was a wrestler and a promoter.\n\n2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:06.080\n He said that he saw him wearing yellow\n\n2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:07.680\n and he's a Tampa guy,\n\n2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:10.520\n so he had that brown skin and the hair and everything.\n\n2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:11.840\n So he's like, oh, that's what I wanna do.\n\n2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:14.320\n And also the brand recognition of like,\n\n2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:17.480\n well, I should do it like McDonald's, literally.\n\n2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:22.200\n And he's a big, swollen, muscular guy\n\n2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:25.000\n with tan brown skin screaming at me\n\n2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:28.120\n to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old.\n\n2:01:28.120 --> 2:01:30.280\n That was extremely...\n\n2:01:30.280 --> 2:01:31.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:32.240\n He's like Superman.\n\n2:01:32.240 --> 2:01:34.240\n But I know there's a person behind that guy.\n\n2:01:34.240 --> 2:01:35.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:36.120\n What do you mean?\n\n2:01:36.120 --> 2:01:38.280\n Well, he's Terry Bollea,\n\n2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:42.600\n the dude who does whatever the fuck he does with his life.\n\n2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:43.440\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:01:43.440 --> 2:01:44.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:45.240\n Complicated life.\n\n2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:48.720\n Yeah, I guess, to be him, yeah.\n\n2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:52.680\n Maybe you should change the dude's colors to yellow, right?\n\n2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:53.520\n Red and yellow.\n\n2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:57.400\n It's currently orange and, boy, sky blue.\n\n2:01:57.400 --> 2:01:59.140\n Yeah, it's like a nice sky blue.\n\n2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:04.000\n What advice, since you're wearing a suit,\n\n2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:05.960\n I feel like you're qualified to give advice.\n\n2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:08.440\n What advice would you give to young people,\n\n2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:09.720\n high school, college,\n\n2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:13.480\n about how to have a career they can be proud of\n\n2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:15.840\n or how to have a life they can be proud of?\n\n2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:19.660\n I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time.\n\n2:02:19.660 --> 2:02:20.500\n That's the only,\n\n2:02:20.500 --> 2:02:23.760\n that's the compass that we have is listening to your gut.\n\n2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:25.880\n What does your gut tell you?\n\n2:02:25.880 --> 2:02:28.800\n Was that originally the dream of being an actor?\n\n2:02:28.800 --> 2:02:29.880\n Yeah, for me.\n\n2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:32.600\n Your parents support that at all?\n\n2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:36.160\n I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants,\n\n2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:40.200\n so they didn't really know a lot about what you...\n\n2:02:40.200 --> 2:02:41.200\n So you just made shit up?\n\n2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:42.280\n You just made shit up?\n\n2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:44.240\n Yeah, of course I'm studying and I'm skipping school\n\n2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:46.160\n to go do auditions and stuff.\n\n2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:48.680\n No, I just kind of feel like,\n\n2:02:48.680 --> 2:02:51.200\n and I know it was different from my older siblings\n\n2:02:51.200 --> 2:02:54.640\n because my parents had just shown up in Canada.\n\n2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:56.240\n I was born like 10 years later.\n\n2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:02.360\n You can get away with some things and you can actually...\n\n2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:05.680\n I think my parents, they wanted us to,\n\n2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:09.200\n they didn't have a whole lot to tell us about what to do.\n\n2:03:10.400 --> 2:03:12.160\n They weren't gonna do that with us\n\n2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:14.400\n because they're in this brand new world\n\n2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:16.200\n and there's all these possibilities.\n\n2:03:17.520 --> 2:03:22.520\n But there was something that I feel like they had to do,\n\n2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:25.680\n which was tell us to do what we love.\n\n2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:27.320\n If you love doing it, do it.\n\n2:03:28.300 --> 2:03:31.400\n And I feel like that's really served me\n\n2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:33.360\n and what I would tell young people is\n\n2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:35.800\n if you can find something you love,\n\n2:03:35.800 --> 2:03:38.560\n and nowadays with the internet and finding other people,\n\n2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.120\n that it's not like you need to find a lot of people anymore.\n\n2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:45.840\n You just need to find the people that dig what you dig.\n\n2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:49.040\n And if you can make a career out of doing something\n\n2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:53.660\n that you love that's been said, it's a good thing.\n\n2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:56.440\n How long did it take you to figure out\n\n2:03:56.440 --> 2:03:59.620\n that you really love acting?\n\n2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:02.080\n Because sometimes you have a dream\n\n2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:05.480\n and the dream meets reality, right?\n\n2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:07.800\n And then the reality might be much less pleasant\n\n2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:09.680\n or much darker than the dream.\n\n2:04:09.680 --> 2:04:12.160\n Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know?\n\n2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:16.120\n And there are things that happen during an experience\n\n2:04:16.120 --> 2:04:19.600\n of shooting something that you could take or leave, right?\n\n2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:23.960\n But the part where you're on set\n\n2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:27.400\n and you've rehearsed for a minute or whatever,\n\n2:04:27.400 --> 2:04:29.000\n at least you know where you're supposed to stand\n\n2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:30.640\n and you know all your lines show up,\n\n2:04:30.640 --> 2:04:33.080\n knowing everything, knowing what you're gonna do\n\n2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:35.440\n and what you aim to do.\n\n2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:38.800\n And those moments make it all worth it.\n\n2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:41.640\n When you're, not to sound like a douchebag,\n\n2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:45.520\n but between action and cut, that's the stuff\n\n2:04:45.520 --> 2:04:50.520\n that has me continuing to do what I do,\n\n2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:54.840\n aside from the fact that it's like,\n\n2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:56.600\n I don't know how to do anything else.\n\n2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:00.500\n You think you'll ever do like a dramatic, like a mob movie?\n\n2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:02.240\n Yeah, like the one, the inside game\n\n2:05:02.240 --> 2:05:03.200\n that I was just talking about,\n\n2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:05.600\n or there's this other movie I just did a little while ago\n\n2:05:05.600 --> 2:05:07.760\n called American Woman that was very heavy.\n\n2:05:08.840 --> 2:05:10.880\n And I love doing dramatic work.\n\n2:05:10.880 --> 2:05:12.880\n I love it, I love it.\n\n2:05:12.880 --> 2:05:15.040\n Yeah, and I played that inside game.\n\n2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:18.360\n It was kind of a, you know, there was a mob element\n\n2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:21.380\n and the fellow was, well, you know,\n\n2:05:21.380 --> 2:05:26.200\n the story's here or there with regard to how deep into the,\n\n2:05:26.200 --> 2:05:27.560\n but well, he was a bookie.\n\n2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:29.880\n He was just running money, you know,\n\n2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:31.880\n he was making a lot of money for a lot of people\n\n2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:33.960\n and he figured out how to, you know,\n\n2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:37.600\n cook it with this dude who was an NBA ref\n\n2:05:37.600 --> 2:05:40.520\n and it's a very interesting documentary,\n\n2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:42.440\n the thing that they just untold,\n\n2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:45.280\n under the untold series, they cover it.\n\n2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:50.240\n But getting to play that guy, that was a gas for me\n\n2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:52.040\n because he's like a, you know,\n\n2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:54.400\n there was a lot of unsavory stuff\n\n2:05:54.400 --> 2:05:57.040\n and he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie\n\n2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:00.240\n who is the wild card and you don't wanna\n\n2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:02.040\n necessarily mess with him.\n\n2:06:02.040 --> 2:06:04.000\n And I got to, by the way, this fellow,\n\n2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:07.240\n who is the real guy, speaking to him,\n\n2:06:07.240 --> 2:06:12.240\n it was just bizarre to hear, like I said to him,\n\n2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:14.240\n he was a little concerned about this and that,\n\n2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:16.560\n like, hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck you want\n\n2:06:16.560 --> 2:06:18.400\n in your movie, I got my book and I got this other\n\n2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:20.540\n fucking deal, but he goes, you know,\n\n2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:22.360\n I didn't do this and I didn't do that.\n\n2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:23.760\n And I'm like, yeah, all right, I got you.\n\n2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:25.360\n And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you,\n\n2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:26.920\n like I'm talking to you one on one,\n\n2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:28.600\n I did not do this, I did, okay?\n\n2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.280\n I'm just fucking telling you, do whatever the fuck\n\n2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:32.320\n you want with your movie, but this is what's up.\n\n2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:33.480\n And I said, you ever seen Goodfellas?\n\n2:06:33.480 --> 2:06:35.520\n He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie.\n\n2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:38.200\n Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit.\n\n2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:40.460\n And I go, you remember the scene where,\n\n2:06:41.740 --> 2:06:43.920\n where, you know, the guy, the neighbor,\n\n2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:46.240\n Lorraine Bracco's neighbor was, you know,\n\n2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:48.280\n made her uncomfortable and was touching on her\n\n2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:50.840\n and she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes,\n\n2:06:50.840 --> 2:06:52.240\n where the fuck does this guy live?\n\n2:06:52.240 --> 2:06:54.400\n And then he go, and remember, he walks across the street\n\n2:06:54.400 --> 2:06:56.280\n and pistol whips the dude.\n\n2:06:56.280 --> 2:06:59.360\n You touch her again, you're dead, you hear me?\n\n2:06:59.360 --> 2:07:01.520\n Don't you fucking great scene.\n\n2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:03.440\n He goes, I love that scene.\n\n2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:04.760\n I go, that's you.\n\n2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:07.600\n So you're doing shit that we know is terrible,\n\n2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:08.440\n but we love you.\n\n2:07:08.440 --> 2:07:09.760\n He goes, all right, I got it.\n\n2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:11.480\n And then I said, there's this one scene,\n\n2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:13.640\n I explained the scene to him where the,\n\n2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:17.240\n one of the mobsters, tough guys was in the window\n\n2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:21.160\n of the car and Jimmy, my character is very coked up\n\n2:07:21.160 --> 2:07:23.520\n at the time and he's hemorrhaging money here and there\n\n2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:25.800\n and making bad bets cause he's getting sloppy.\n\n2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:28.600\n And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets Giants bet\n\n2:07:28.600 --> 2:07:30.240\n or something and I'm like, telling you fucking asshole,\n\n2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:31.600\n don't fucking do it.\n\n2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:33.320\n He's like, yeah, well, the fucking Giants.\n\n2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:36.120\n And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him\n\n2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:39.040\n by the lapels and just smashes his face\n\n2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:41.600\n against the roof of the car.\n\n2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:45.120\n And I say this to Jimmy and he goes,\n\n2:07:45.120 --> 2:07:46.280\n oh yeah, I would have done that.\n\n2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:48.280\n That's not a fucking big deal.\n\n2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:50.080\n I wonder also the interaction.\n\n2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:51.800\n I wonder what the filming of,\n\n2:07:51.800 --> 2:07:56.480\n probably my favorite gambling movie is Casino\n\n2:07:56.480 --> 2:07:59.440\n with Joe Pesci and De Niro.\n\n2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:00.560\n Like when they're out in the desert,\n\n2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:01.480\n you're yelling at each other.\n\n2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:03.320\n I wonder how many takes that is.\n\n2:08:03.320 --> 2:08:07.080\n Like, cause they, I don't know how scripted that is.\n\n2:08:07.080 --> 2:08:08.360\n I mean, it probably is a little bit,\n\n2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:13.080\n but like, I don't think you can script the performance\n\n2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:14.400\n that Joe Pesci does.\n\n2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.080\n Don't make a fuck out of me, Ace.\n\n2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:17.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:19.960\n Like, I fucking brought you here.\n\n2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:24.560\n Yeah, he's just like pointing at that energy\n\n2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:25.720\n and they're standing there.\n\n2:08:25.720 --> 2:08:26.560\n And their friendship.\n\n2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:29.920\n And then De Niro's like that whole thing.\n\n2:08:29.920 --> 2:08:33.000\n And then in the pet, yeah, like that energy.\n\n2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:33.840\n What is that?\n\n2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:37.120\n I mean, they must, they somehow find it together.\n\n2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:39.080\n You could tell me that that was one take\n\n2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:39.920\n and I'd believe you.\n\n2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:42.280\n You could tell me that that was seven takes\n\n2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:43.120\n and I would believe you.\n\n2:08:43.120 --> 2:08:45.240\n I bet you all the takes had that energy.\n\n2:08:45.240 --> 2:08:46.640\n Like they were playing with it, right?\n\n2:08:46.640 --> 2:08:50.400\n They were playing with that, this, yeah.\n\n2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.400\n I mean, they took on a real personality in those scenes\n\n2:08:55.880 --> 2:08:57.080\n and really carried them forward.\n\n2:08:57.080 --> 2:08:58.920\n I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance.\n\n2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:01.720\n Doesn't get, like comedies, like mob movies\n\n2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:04.040\n probably don't get enough credit either\n\n2:09:04.040 --> 2:09:05.480\n because it's seen as like.\n\n2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:06.800\n Mob movies don't get enough credit?\n\n2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:07.640\n What do you mean?\n\n2:09:07.640 --> 2:09:08.680\n In the Oscars, I mean like that.\n\n2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:09.960\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.320\n Cause it seems like a trope.\n\n2:09:11.320 --> 2:09:12.960\n It's like given a Western,\n\n2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.880\n it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever\n\n2:09:14.880 --> 2:09:17.120\n cause it's like an old Hollywood trope.\n\n2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:19.720\n Yeah, no, I, that scene is so great\n\n2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:20.680\n cause they're never at,\n\n2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:24.240\n they're at the height of their friendship in a way\n\n2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:27.520\n and they're also pretty much about to let go of it\n\n2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:28.640\n and become enemies.\n\n2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.200\n And both things are happening at the same time.\n\n2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:33.720\n And Pesci drives them out to the desert.\n\n2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:35.920\n And if I remember correctly,\n\n2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:39.600\n the Nero's character, Ace Rothstein, Rothschild,\n\n2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:43.840\n he says, I gave myself 50 50, whether I'm coming back.\n\n2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:45.240\n Yeah, it's such a good scene.\n\n2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:48.280\n It was a, usually my prospects of coming back\n\n2:09:48.280 --> 2:09:51.520\n from the desert would be 90 to 10 or something like that.\n\n2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:54.160\n But now it was, this time I wasn't sure\n\n2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:56.440\n and there's the car driving really fast.\n\n2:09:56.440 --> 2:09:58.960\n And then Joe Pesci is like, you mother fucker, you,\n\n2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:00.120\n like whatever he was doing.\n\n2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:00.960\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:02.600\n A Jew, of course it's anti Semitism.\n\n2:10:02.600 --> 2:10:03.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:07.120\n We're not between friends, who gives a shit?\n\n2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:08.160\n All that kind of stuff.\n\n2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:10.600\n Yeah, I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances.\n\n2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:12.920\n So yeah, I can understand why you love the art\n\n2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:15.000\n and putting it all out there and leave it.\n\n2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:15.840\n Yeah, it's fun.\n\n2:10:15.840 --> 2:10:16.680\n It's fun.\n\n2:10:16.680 --> 2:10:17.520\n And it's still fun.\n\n2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:19.080\n It's still crazy fun.\n\n2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:22.200\n If I go a while without getting a gig,\n\n2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:27.760\n if I go a minute, then I end up and I work on something,\n\n2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:32.360\n I'm like, it's like, oh, I've been thirsty for this.\n\n2:10:32.360 --> 2:10:36.000\n Like I actually am really so happy.\n\n2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:37.920\n Even if it's something where it's like,\n\n2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:42.320\n the things where this was a pain in the ass\n\n2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:44.680\n and that or whatever, you're on the road doing something\n\n2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:46.880\n and anything, whatever, you lost your luggage\n\n2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:48.640\n or whatever the heck you've got going on\n\n2:10:48.640 --> 2:10:52.520\n in your day to day life that everyone brings to work\n\n2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:54.400\n and tries to let go of.\n\n2:10:54.400 --> 2:10:57.360\n Once we're doing the scene, oh man, it's the best.\n\n2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.120\n But that said, you're a great actor,\n\n2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:03.920\n but I just think I speak for a lot of people\n\n2:11:03.920 --> 2:11:06.600\n that you're also, there's a charisma to you\n\n2:11:06.600 --> 2:11:10.200\n that's great to reveal in raw form in different podcasts.\n\n2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:11.280\n Oh, cheers man.\n\n2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:14.680\n In DudeZ, 10 Minute Pod, just as a guest in podcasts,\n\n2:11:14.680 --> 2:11:17.040\n it's always really fun to watch you.\n\n2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:17.880\n Cheers.\n\n2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:19.840\n The way you have fun, the way you think.\n\n2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.360\n The raw, the raw will sassle,\n\n2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:25.880\n which is a nice compliment to your kind of acting.\n\n2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:26.960\n That's really sweet.\n\n2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:27.880\n Yeah, cheers.\n\n2:11:27.880 --> 2:11:31.160\n Well, you know, look, you said, you know.\n\n2:11:32.120 --> 2:11:33.200\n You're making that face.\n\n2:11:33.200 --> 2:11:34.040\n I'm making that face.\n\n2:11:34.040 --> 2:11:35.800\n I'm making that after the take face.\n\n2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:38.120\n No, I love doing stuff off the cuff.\n\n2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:39.040\n That's kind of you to say.\n\n2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:42.640\n And I dig, I really do dig doing stuff\n\n2:11:42.640 --> 2:11:43.960\n in front of an audience,\n\n2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:46.480\n because I love seeing,\n\n2:11:46.480 --> 2:11:48.520\n I don't give it to myself very often.\n\n2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:50.400\n If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know,\n\n2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:52.760\n I've done a bunch of multi camera sitcoms and stuff.\n\n2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:55.240\n Mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience.\n\n2:11:55.240 --> 2:11:56.400\n You like that energy?\n\n2:11:56.400 --> 2:11:58.680\n I love it, but I can only hear them.\n\n2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:00.320\n You can't see them because of the lights\n\n2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:02.800\n like it is in a lot of performances.\n\n2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:06.160\n And I would imagine with standup, it's, you know,\n\n2:12:06.160 --> 2:12:08.600\n you see the first couple of rows.\n\n2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:11.840\n I've done, I do this character that does stand up\n\n2:12:11.840 --> 2:12:14.400\n and I used to take him out and do things with him\n\n2:12:14.400 --> 2:12:16.360\n and do little bits here and there.\n\n2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:18.520\n I haven't done it in like four or five years.\n\n2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:21.800\n I think, did Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby?\n\n2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:25.240\n Yeah, but he said, I have to do it as myself too.\n\n2:12:25.240 --> 2:12:26.840\n I think in that podcast, he's like,\n\n2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:29.560\n okay, you're gonna come with me and open for me in Brea,\n\n2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.080\n but you have to do it as yourself.\n\n2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:32.400\n Did that ever happen?\n\n2:12:32.400 --> 2:12:33.240\n It did.\n\n2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:36.960\n And I did the character, you know,\n\n2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:39.160\n who's the character I came up with on 10 Minute Podcast.\n\n2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:40.680\n He's just this comedian, right?\n\n2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:42.960\n He calls himself an open mic veteran.\n\n2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.520\n You know, he's been doing open mics forever.\n\n2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:48.000\n And so I did it at opening up for Bobby\n\n2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.840\n and he's like, you have to do some of it as yourself.\n\n2:12:50.840 --> 2:12:52.080\n So I just kind of did this bit\n\n2:12:52.080 --> 2:12:53.760\n where I would do some of his jokes\n\n2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:56.200\n and then I would take Lee Leon, silly,\n\n2:12:56.200 --> 2:12:59.520\n I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go,\n\n2:12:59.520 --> 2:13:01.520\n and as myself, I start explaining it.\n\n2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:02.840\n Hello, my name is Will.\n\n2:13:02.840 --> 2:13:04.480\n See, the reason that it's funny\n\n2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:08.040\n is because Arnold Schwarzenegger is always,\n\n2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:09.320\n he's in these movies\n\n2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:11.160\n and he's got the thick Austrian accent,\n\n2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:13.240\n but he's like, my name is Ben Williams.\n\n2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:15.880\n I'm a cop from Colorado.\n\n2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:17.240\n No, you're not.\n\n2:13:17.240 --> 2:13:19.680\n And it doesn't make sense as the comedian character\n\n2:13:19.680 --> 2:13:21.360\n that I'm doing because that character\n\n2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:23.040\n doesn't do impersonations.\n\n2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:24.680\n Okay, carrying on.\n\n2:13:24.680 --> 2:13:25.920\n And then I put the wig back on\n\n2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:28.040\n and go back into this dumb thing.\n\n2:13:28.040 --> 2:13:29.840\n And I don't think it was very good,\n\n2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:32.760\n but Bobby required it in order for me to open for him.\n\n2:13:32.760 --> 2:13:34.040\n He's like, you're not fucking doing it.\n\n2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:36.360\n So I'm not gonna get up on stage and not do,\n\n2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:38.040\n we agreed, I'll do it.\n\n2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:42.400\n But having been up there just in, you know, whatever,\n\n2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.440\n I've done it like a dozen fucking times or whatever,\n\n2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:45.520\n not a bunch of times, right?\n\n2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:46.360\n Like nothing.\n\n2:13:47.240 --> 2:13:49.600\n And you know, these comedians that go up every night,\n\n2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:51.920\n sometimes two times a night.\n\n2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:54.440\n It's, I do, I will say,\n\n2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:59.120\n I love performing in front of people when I get the chance,\n\n2:13:59.120 --> 2:14:04.120\n but it's a specific thing that I just, I don't know.\n\n2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:07.920\n I gotta go back to this.\n\n2:14:07.920 --> 2:14:10.920\n It's like the providing value, you know?\n\n2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:13.280\n I think great standups are fucking incredible.\n\n2:14:13.280 --> 2:14:17.080\n I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watched standup,\n\n2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:19.120\n you know, there's your friend you're going to see,\n\n2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:21.680\n but then there's this other person who really speaks to you.\n\n2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:22.840\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:27.560\n And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot.\n\n2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:32.560\n Cause a comedy club is like a fucking crazy restaurant\n\n2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:36.120\n where there's no menu.\n\n2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:38.000\n And it's like, what would you like?\n\n2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.240\n There's nothing else like that.\n\n2:14:39.240 --> 2:14:42.440\n There's like, you don't go to like a music place.\n\n2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:43.480\n What do we got here?\n\n2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:45.840\n We got Christian metal and there's some world music\n\n2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:47.520\n and then there's a reggae thing\n\n2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:50.440\n and it's all rammed in together.\n\n2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:52.280\n Or you don't go to a restaurant.\n\n2:14:52.280 --> 2:14:53.400\n I'd love a nice steak.\n\n2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:54.240\n Cool.\n\n2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:55.880\n First, here's a bowl of Froot Loops.\n\n2:14:55.880 --> 2:14:57.960\n And then we got you a crudite.\n\n2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:00.080\n And then this is our sushi tower.\n\n2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:00.920\n Well, what about the steak?\n\n2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:02.120\n Oh, the steak's coming.\n\n2:15:02.120 --> 2:15:03.200\n And then blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:04.560\n Oh no, the steak got bumped.\n\n2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:05.800\n So there's no steak,\n\n2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:07.960\n but here's a fucking shitty store bought cheesecake.\n\n2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:08.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:12.120\n You know, and that's what comedians are up against\n\n2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:13.720\n when they go into a place and it's like,\n\n2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:16.320\n I don't pair well with the poached salmon.\n\n2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:17.520\n You know, I'm chicken fingers.\n\n2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:20.120\n I already am chicken fingers.\n\n2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:23.640\n So, you know, these great comedians that are able to go up\n\n2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:26.320\n on a night where poached salmon goes up\n\n2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:28.880\n and then it's like, fuck, you were also spicy?\n\n2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:30.320\n I got some kick to me.\n\n2:15:30.320 --> 2:15:33.480\n For me, even going to open mics,\n\n2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:36.040\n it could be a wonderful escape.\n\n2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:36.880\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.120\n I mean, just laughing together with others.\n\n2:15:40.120 --> 2:15:41.240\n It could make you, I don't know,\n\n2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:42.480\n it just feels really good.\n\n2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:43.760\n Well, and we've done like, you know,\n\n2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:46.080\n like, and I hope to do it with Doodsy,\n\n2:15:46.080 --> 2:15:50.220\n but like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people.\n\n2:15:50.220 --> 2:15:52.020\n And you know, you talk to them afterwards\n\n2:15:52.020 --> 2:15:54.880\n and take some pictures and man, they are,\n\n2:15:54.880 --> 2:15:57.520\n they forgot what the fuck they got going on.\n\n2:15:57.520 --> 2:15:59.680\n And a lot of them got to go back to work the next day.\n\n2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.880\n It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know?\n\n2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:03.480\n No, it's a lot of value.\n\n2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:07.240\n I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit.\n\n2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:09.240\n What's the meaning of life with Sasa?\n\n2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:12.200\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:16:12.200 --> 2:16:13.040\n Why are we

2:16:19.360\n at the end of meaning of life?\n\n2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:21.440\n I think it was Michael Palin that said,\n\n2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:24.400\n try to get a walk in, be nice to neighbors,\n\n2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:25.440\n eat enough fiber.\n\n2:16:25.440 --> 2:16:26.280\n Wasn't that the?\n\n2:16:26.280 --> 2:16:27.920\n Fiber? Fiber is part of it?\n\n2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:29.600\n Yeah, I think it's, I think it's just,\n\n2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:31.520\n have a bowl of bran in the morning\n\n2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:33.440\n and don't take yourself too seriously.\n\n2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:36.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000\n No, well, no one gets out alive, I think is the.\n\n2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:39.600\n Herman Hesse, one of my favorite writers,\n\n2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:40.920\n he's a Nobel Prize winner,\n\n2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:44.920\n in a book called Steppenwolf,\n\n2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:47.160\n says, learn what is to be taken seriously\n\n2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:48.720\n and laugh at the rest.\n\n2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:49.800\n Oh, that's awesome.\n\n2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:51.840\n What's the percentage distribution on that?\n\n2:16:51.840 --> 2:16:54.400\n So how much of life should you take seriously?\n\n2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:57.520\n And then how much do you just laugh at?\n\n2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:00.600\n Oh man, if you can laugh at everything, you're winning.\n\n2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:01.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:01.440 --> 2:17:03.160\n But that's almost impossible.\n\n2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:04.400\n I think that there's,\n\n2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:09.360\n and also could be quite irresponsible to do that.\n\n2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:13.640\n I take things, I take a lot of things way too seriously.\n\n2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:14.480\n I know that.\n\n2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:17.360\n I do, I do, I really do.\n\n2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:19.520\n People will be in part surprised by that,\n\n2:17:19.520 --> 2:17:21.440\n but I think that radiates from you.\n\n2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:22.280\n Really?\n\n2:17:22.280 --> 2:17:23.120\n Yeah, I do, I do.\n\n2:17:23.120 --> 2:17:25.720\n I take things way too fucking seriously sometimes.\n\n2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:29.800\n But, yeah, they're gonna loosen the neck up.\n\n2:17:29.800 --> 2:17:32.960\n But no, I think that's really good.\n\n2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:34.840\n That's really good stuff.\n\n2:17:34.840 --> 2:17:37.600\n I don't know what the percentage is to have a good life\n\n2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:42.600\n or a happy, healthy life, but you know,\n\n2:17:43.480 --> 2:17:46.600\n for me, the meaning of life is getting to live it\n\n2:17:46.600 --> 2:17:48.320\n as long as you hope to.\n\n2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:53.320\n That's nice, and when you lose someone\n\n2:17:53.920 --> 2:17:57.360\n or if perhaps you're faced with your own mortality,\n\n2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.440\n I think that puts that into perspective.\n\n2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:04.120\n But, you know.\n\n2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:05.600\n Get lots of fiber.\n\n2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:09.640\n Get lots of fiber, be nice to everybody,\n\n2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.960\n and yeah, don't take things too seriously is a good one.\n\n2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:18.960\n Our minds are fucking big weird shitty fucking bucket of shit\n\n2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:24.640\n that's trying to get you to think horrible shit\n\n2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:26.080\n about yourself all the time.\n\n2:18:26.080 --> 2:18:27.320\n Yeah, shitty bucket of shit.\n\n2:18:27.320 --> 2:18:28.160\n Shitty bucket of shit.\n\n2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:29.640\n I think there's a book I never read,\n\n2:18:29.640 --> 2:18:32.160\n but I read the title, and it's Good Words to Live By,\n\n2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:35.240\n which is don't sweat the small stuff,\n\n2:18:35.240 --> 2:18:37.680\n and it's all small stuff.\n\n2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:38.840\n That's another way.\n\n2:18:38.840 --> 2:18:39.960\n Was that Dr. Phil?\n\n2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:41.440\n Wasn't Dr. Phil what's?\n\n2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:42.280\n I don't know.\n\n2:18:42.280 --> 2:18:46.280\n But I think the conclusion also has fiber as part of it.\n\n2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:48.360\n I think that all ties it together,\n\n2:18:48.360 --> 2:18:50.680\n and in the end, of course,\n\n2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:53.360\n just put love out there in the world.\n\n2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:56.160\n I think that's a pretty good way to go.\n\n2:18:56.160 --> 2:18:58.480\n What would you say is the meaning of life?\n\n2:18:58.480 --> 2:18:59.880\n Put love out in the world?\n\n2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:00.840\n I would say love, yeah.\n\n2:19:00.840 --> 2:19:02.200\n Yeah?
