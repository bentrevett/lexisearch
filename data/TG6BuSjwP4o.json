00:09.240\n of the Dark Horse podcast, and, as he says,\n\n00:09.240 --> 00:11.160\n reluctant radical.\n\n00:11.160 --> 00:14.200\n Even though we've never met or spoken before this,\n\n00:14.200 --> 00:17.440\n we both felt like we've been friends for a long time,\n\n00:17.440 --> 00:19.680\n I don't agree on everything with Brett,\n\n00:19.680 --> 00:22.060\n but I'm sure as hell happy he exists\n\n00:22.060 --> 00:25.120\n in this weird and wonderful world of ours.\n\n00:25.120 --> 00:27.040\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:27.040 --> 00:30.920\n Jordan Harmon's show, ExpressVPN, Magic Spoon,\n\n00:30.920 --> 00:32.480\n and Four Sigmatic.\n\n00:32.480 --> 00:35.920\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:35.920 --> 00:39.280\n As a side note, let me say a few words about COVID 19\n\n00:39.280 --> 00:41.240\n and about science broadly.\n\n00:41.240 --> 00:44.240\n I think science is beautiful and powerful.\n\n00:44.240 --> 00:46.600\n It is the striving of the human mind\n\n00:46.600 --> 00:50.100\n to understand and to solve the problems of the world.\n\n00:50.100 --> 00:51.520\n But as an institution,\n\n00:51.520 --> 00:54.260\n it is susceptible to the flaws of human nature,\n\n00:54.260 --> 00:58.360\n to fear, to greed, power, and ego.\n\n00:58.360 --> 01:00.600\n 2020 is the story of all of these\n\n01:00.600 --> 01:04.140\n that has both scientific triumph and tragedy.\n\n01:04.140 --> 01:07.260\n We needed great leaders and we didn't get them.\n\n01:07.260 --> 01:09.380\n What we needed is leaders who communicate\n\n01:09.380 --> 01:12.040\n in an honest, transparent, and authentic way\n\n01:12.040 --> 01:14.060\n about the uncertainty of what we know\n\n01:14.060 --> 01:16.100\n and the large scale scientific efforts\n\n01:16.100 --> 01:19.600\n to reduce that uncertainty and to develop solutions.\n\n01:19.600 --> 01:21.840\n I believe there are several candidates for solutions\n\n01:21.840 --> 01:25.340\n that could have all saved hundreds of billions of dollars\n\n01:25.340 --> 01:27.840\n and lessened or eliminated\n\n01:27.840 --> 01:30.200\n the suffering of millions of people.\n\n01:30.200 --> 01:33.020\n Let me mention five of the categories of solutions.\n\n01:33.020 --> 01:37.040\n Masks, at home testing, anonymized contact tracing,\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:39.540\n antiviral drugs, and vaccines.\n\n01:39.540 --> 01:41.280\n Within each of these categories,\n\n01:41.280 --> 01:44.120\n institutional leaders should have constantly asked\n\n01:44.120 --> 01:46.880\n and answered publicly, honestly,\n\n01:46.880 --> 01:48.880\n the following three questions.\n\n01:48.880 --> 01:52.000\n One, what data do we have on the solution\n\n01:52.000 --> 01:53.280\n and what studies are we running\n\n01:53.280 --> 01:55.160\n to get more and better data?\n\n01:55.160 --> 01:57.920\n Two, given the current data and uncertainty,\n\n01:57.920 --> 02:01.180\n how effective and how safe is the solution?\n\n02:01.180 --> 02:04.200\n Three, what is the timeline and cost involved\n\n02:04.200 --> 02:07.460\n with mass manufacturing distribution of the solution?\n\n02:07.460 --> 02:09.000\n In the service of these questions,\n\n02:09.000 --> 02:11.080\n no voices should have been silenced,\n\n02:11.080 --> 02:13.120\n no ideas left off the table.\n\n02:13.120 --> 02:15.040\n Open data, open science,\n\n02:15.040 --> 02:17.620\n open, honest scientific communication and debate\n\n02:17.620 --> 02:20.280\n was the way, not censorship.\n\n02:20.280 --> 02:21.960\n There are a lot of ideas out there\n\n02:21.960 --> 02:24.840\n that are bad, wrong, dangerous,\n\n02:24.840 --> 02:26.840\n but the moment we have the hubris\n\n02:26.840 --> 02:29.680\n to say we know which ideas those are\n\n02:29.680 --> 02:32.500\n is the moment we'll lose our ability to find the truth,\n\n02:32.500 --> 02:33.920\n to find solutions,\n\n02:33.920 --> 02:37.840\n the very things that make science beautiful and powerful\n\n02:37.840 --> 02:40.500\n in the face of all the dangers that threaten the wellbeing\n\n02:40.500 --> 02:43.600\n and the existence of humans on Earth.\n\n02:43.600 --> 02:44.880\n This conversation with Brett\n\n02:44.880 --> 02:46.840\n is less about the ideas we talk about.\n\n02:46.840 --> 02:49.000\n We agree on some, disagree on others.\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:52.280\n It is much more about the very freedom to talk,\n\n02:52.280 --> 02:54.960\n to think, to share ideas.\n\n02:54.960 --> 02:57.320\n This freedom is our only hope.\n\n02:57.320 --> 03:00.040\n Brett should never have been censored.\n\n03:00.040 --> 03:03.360\n I asked Brett to do this podcast to show solidarity\n\n03:03.360 --> 03:07.360\n and to show that I have hope for science and for humanity.\n\n03:08.200 --> 03:10.160\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast\n\n03:10.160 --> 03:13.400\n and here's my conversation with Brett Weinstein.\n\n03:13.400 --> 03:18.080\n What to you is beautiful about the study of biology,\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:21.000\n the science, the engineering, the philosophy of it?\n\n03:21.000 --> 03:22.320\n It's a very interesting question.\n\n03:22.320 --> 03:27.320\n I must say at one level, it's not a conscious thing.\n\n03:27.520 --> 03:30.700\n I can say a lot about why as an adult\n\n03:30.700 --> 03:32.100\n I find biology compelling,\n\n03:32.100 --> 03:36.720\n but as a kid I was completely fascinated with animals.\n\n03:36.720 --> 03:40.280\n I loved to watch them and think about why they did\n\n03:40.280 --> 03:44.920\n what they did and that developed into a very conscious\n\n03:44.920 --> 03:46.520\n passion as an adult.\n\n03:46.520 --> 03:51.520\n But I think in the same way that one is drawn to a person,\n\n03:51.760 --> 03:56.760\n I was drawn to the never ending series of near miracles\n\n03:59.320 --> 04:02.440\n that exists across biological nature.\n\n04:02.440 --> 04:03.840\n When you see a living organism,\n\n04:03.840 --> 04:08.160\n do you see it from an evolutionary biology perspective\n\n04:08.160 --> 04:10.080\n of like this entire thing that moves around\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:14.200\n in this world or do you see from an engineering perspective\n\n04:14.200 --> 04:18.000\n that first principles almost down to the physics,\n\n04:18.000 --> 04:21.200\n like the little components that build up hierarchies\n\n04:21.200 --> 04:24.760\n that you have cells, the first proteins and cells\n\n04:24.760 --> 04:27.160\n and organs and all that kind of stuff.\n\n04:27.160 --> 04:29.880\n So do you see low level or do you see high level?\n\n04:30.820 --> 04:32.760\n Well, the human mind is a strange thing\n\n04:32.760 --> 04:37.760\n and I think it's probably a bit like a time sharing machine\n\n04:37.760 --> 04:40.360\n in which I have different modules.\n\n04:40.360 --> 04:43.360\n We don't know enough about biology for them to connect.\n\n04:43.360 --> 04:46.240\n So they exist in isolation and I'm always aware\n\n04:46.240 --> 04:48.880\n that they do connect, but I basically have to step\n\n04:48.880 --> 04:53.760\n into a module in order to see the evolutionary dynamics\n\n04:53.760 --> 04:56.940\n of the creature and the lineage that it belongs to.\n\n04:56.940 --> 04:59.040\n I have to step into a different module to think\n\n04:59.040 --> 05:02.240\n of that lineage over a very long time scale,\n\n05:02.240 --> 05:04.400\n a different module still to understand\n\n05:04.400 --> 05:06.940\n what the mechanisms inside would have to look like\n\n05:06.940 --> 05:11.080\n to account for what we can see from the outside.\n\n05:11.080 --> 05:15.960\n And I think that probably sounds really complicated,\n\n05:15.960 --> 05:20.680\n but one of the things about being involved\n\n05:20.680 --> 05:25.160\n in a topic like biology and doing so for one,\n\n05:25.160 --> 05:27.480\n really not even just my adult life for my whole life\n\n05:27.480 --> 05:29.400\n is that it becomes second nature.\n\n05:29.400 --> 05:34.400\n And when we see somebody do an amazing parkour routine\n\n05:34.400 --> 05:38.920\n or something like that, we think about what they must\n\n05:38.920 --> 05:41.440\n be doing in order to accomplish that.\n\n05:41.440 --> 05:43.720\n But of course, what they are doing is tapping\n\n05:43.720 --> 05:46.280\n into some kind of zone, right?\n\n05:46.280 --> 05:51.280\n They are in a zone in which they are in such command\n\n05:51.420 --> 05:53.660\n of their center of gravity, for example,\n\n05:53.660 --> 05:56.840\n that they know how to hurl it around a landscape\n\n05:56.840 --> 05:59.000\n so that they always land on their feet.\n\n05:59.000 --> 06:04.000\n And I would just say for anyone who hasn't found a topic\n\n06:04.960 --> 06:08.780\n on which they can develop that kind of facility,\n\n06:08.780 --> 06:11.500\n it is absolutely worthwhile.\n\n06:11.500 --> 06:13.700\n It's really something that human beings are capable\n\n06:13.700 --> 06:16.280\n of doing across a wide range of topics,\n\n06:16.280 --> 06:19.560\n many things our ancestors didn't even have access to.\n\n06:19.560 --> 06:21.980\n And that flexibility of humans,\n\n06:21.980 --> 06:26.120\n that ability to repurpose our machinery\n\n06:26.120 --> 06:29.980\n for topics that are novel means really,\n\n06:29.980 --> 06:30.940\n the world is your oyster.\n\n06:30.940 --> 06:32.900\n You can figure out what your passion is\n\n06:32.900 --> 06:34.780\n and then figure out all of the angles\n\n06:34.780 --> 06:38.140\n that one would have to pursue to really deeply understand it.\n\n06:38.140 --> 06:42.820\n And it is well worth having at least one topic like that.\n\n06:42.820 --> 06:45.700\n You mean embracing the full adaptability\n\n06:45.700 --> 06:49.360\n of both the body and the mind.\n\n06:49.360 --> 06:53.440\n So like, I don't know what to attribute the parkour to,\n\n06:53.440 --> 06:56.580\n like biomechanics of how our bodies can move,\n\n06:56.580 --> 06:58.020\n or is it the mind?\n\n06:58.020 --> 07:00.120\n Like how much percent wise,\n\n07:00.120 --> 07:04.780\n is it the entirety of the hierarchies of biology\n\n07:04.780 --> 07:06.100\n that we've been talking about,\n\n07:06.100 --> 07:09.380\n or is it just all the mind?\n\n07:09.380 --> 07:10.740\n The way to think about creatures\n\n07:10.740 --> 07:14.180\n is that every creature is two things simultaneously.\n\n07:14.180 --> 07:17.940\n A creature is a machine of sorts, right?\n\n07:17.940 --> 07:20.580\n It's not a machine in the,\n\n07:20.580 --> 07:22.620\n I call it an aqueous machine, right?\n\n07:22.620 --> 07:24.860\n And it's run by an aqueous computer, right?\n\n07:24.860 --> 07:29.060\n So it's not identical to our technological machines.\n\n07:29.060 --> 07:31.900\n But every creature is both a machine\n\n07:31.900 --> 07:33.180\n that does things in the world\n\n07:33.180 --> 07:36.380\n sufficient to accumulate enough resources\n\n07:36.380 --> 07:39.600\n to continue surviving, to reproduce.\n\n07:39.600 --> 07:41.520\n It is also a potential.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:45.580\n So each creature is potentially, for example,\n\n07:45.580 --> 07:47.220\n the most recent common ancestor\n\n07:47.220 --> 07:48.800\n of some future clade of creatures\n\n07:48.800 --> 07:50.500\n that will look very different from it.\n\n07:50.500 --> 07:53.780\n And if a creature is very, very good at being a creature,\n\n07:53.780 --> 07:56.240\n but not very good in terms of the potential\n\n07:56.240 --> 07:57.740\n it has going forward,\n\n07:57.740 --> 08:01.400\n then that lineage will not last very long into the future\n\n08:01.400 --> 08:04.980\n because change will throw at challenges\n\n08:04.980 --> 08:07.260\n that its descendants will not be able to meet.\n\n08:07.260 --> 08:12.260\n So the thing about humans is we are a generalist platform,\n\n08:13.560 --> 08:17.500\n and we have the ability to swap out our software\n\n08:17.500 --> 08:20.740\n to exist in many, many different niches.\n\n08:20.740 --> 08:24.140\n And I was once watching an interview\n\n08:24.140 --> 08:27.060\n with this British group of parkour experts\n\n08:27.060 --> 08:31.120\n who were being, they were discussing what it is they do\n\n08:31.120 --> 08:31.960\n and how it works.\n\n08:31.960 --> 08:33.300\n And what they essentially said is,\n\n08:33.300 --> 08:38.300\n look, you're tapping into deep monkey stuff, right?\n\n08:39.300 --> 08:41.720\n And I thought, yeah, that's about right.\n\n08:41.720 --> 08:46.180\n And anybody who is proficient at something\n\n08:46.180 --> 08:49.700\n like skiing or skateboarding, you know,\n\n08:49.700 --> 08:54.580\n has the experience of flying down the hill\n\n08:54.580 --> 08:56.220\n on skis, for example,\n\n08:56.220 --> 08:59.920\n bouncing from the top of one mogul to the next.\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:02.520\n And if you really pay attention,\n\n09:02.520 --> 09:04.360\n you will discover that your conscious mind\n\n09:04.360 --> 09:05.600\n is actually a spectator.\n\n09:05.600 --> 09:08.160\n It's there, it's involved in the experience,\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:09.060\n but it's not driving.\n\n09:09.060 --> 09:10.340\n Some part of you knows how to ski,\n\n09:10.340 --> 09:12.720\n and it's not the part of you that knows how to think.\n\n09:12.720 --> 09:17.180\n And I would just say that what accounts\n\n09:17.180 --> 09:19.900\n for this flexibility in humans\n\n09:19.900 --> 09:23.180\n is the ability to bootstrap a new software program\n\n09:24.040 --> 09:27.120\n and then drive it into the unconscious layer\n\n09:27.120 --> 09:30.000\n where it can be applied very rapidly.\n\n09:30.000 --> 09:31.740\n And, you know, I will be shocked\n\n09:31.740 --> 09:36.100\n if the exact thing doesn't exist in robotics.\n\n09:36.100 --> 09:37.920\n You know, if you programmed a robot\n\n09:37.920 --> 09:40.220\n to deal with circumstances that were novel to it,\n\n09:40.220 --> 09:41.060\n how would you do it?\n\n09:41.060 --> 09:43.100\n It would have to look something like this.\n\n09:43.100 --> 09:46.180\n There's a certain kind of magic, you're right,\n\n09:46.180 --> 09:48.620\n with the consciousness being an observer.\n\n09:48.620 --> 09:51.620\n When you play guitar, for example, or piano for me,\n\n09:51.620 --> 09:55.460\n music, when you get truly lost in it,\n\n09:55.460 --> 09:57.740\n I don't know what the heck is responsible\n\n09:57.740 --> 09:59.100\n for the flow of the music,\n\n09:59.100 --> 10:02.820\n the kind of the loudness of the music going up and down,\n\n10:02.820 --> 10:06.280\n the timing, the intricate, like even the mistakes,\n\n10:06.280 --> 10:07.120\n all those things,\n\n10:07.120 --> 10:09.260\n that doesn't seem to be the conscious mind.\n\n10:09.260 --> 10:12.020\n It is just observing,\n\n10:12.020 --> 10:14.540\n and yet it's somehow intricately involved.\n\n10:14.540 --> 10:17.180\n More, like, because you mentioned parkour,\n\n10:17.180 --> 10:18.820\n the dance is like that too.\n\n10:18.820 --> 10:20.860\n When you start up in tango dancing,\n\n10:20.860 --> 10:24.020\n if when you truly lose yourself in it,\n\n10:24.020 --> 10:26.940\n then it's just like you're an observer,\n\n10:26.940 --> 10:29.060\n and how the hell is the body able to do that?\n\n10:29.060 --> 10:31.220\n And not only that, it's the physical motion\n\n10:31.220 --> 10:33.900\n is also creating the emotion,\n\n10:33.900 --> 10:38.900\n the, like, the damn is good to be alive feeling.\n\n10:40.540 --> 10:44.460\n So, but then that's also intricately connected\n\n10:44.460 --> 10:47.660\n to the full biology stack that we're operating in.\n\n10:47.660 --> 10:50.140\n I don't know how difficult it is to replicate that.\n\n10:50.140 --> 10:53.540\n We're talking offline about Boston Dynamics robots.\n\n10:54.880 --> 10:57.980\n They've recently been, they did both parkour,\n\n10:57.980 --> 11:01.100\n they did flips, they've also done some dancing,\n\n11:02.180 --> 11:03.540\n and it's something I think a lot about\n\n11:03.540 --> 11:07.940\n because what most people don't realize\n\n11:07.940 --> 11:09.580\n because they don't look deep enough\n\n11:09.580 --> 11:13.980\n is those robots are hard coded to do those things.\n\n11:13.980 --> 11:16.940\n The robots didn't figure it out by themselves,\n\n11:16.940 --> 11:20.620\n and yet the fundamental aspect of what it means to be human\n\n11:20.620 --> 11:23.900\n is that process of figuring out, of making mistakes,\n\n11:23.900 --> 11:26.240\n and then there's something about overcoming\n\n11:26.240 --> 11:27.940\n those challenges and the mistakes\n\n11:27.940 --> 11:30.100\n and, like, figuring out how to lose yourself\n\n11:30.100 --> 11:34.100\n in the magic of the dancing or just movement\n\n11:34.100 --> 11:35.540\n is what it means to be human.\n\n11:35.540 --> 11:38.620\n That learning process, so that's what I want to do\n\n11:38.620 --> 11:42.260\n with the, almost as a fun side thing\n\n11:42.260 --> 11:44.700\n with the Boston Dynamics robots,\n\n11:44.700 --> 11:48.400\n is to have them learn and see what they figure out,\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:50.940\n even if they make mistakes.\n\n11:50.940 --> 11:55.140\n I want to let Spot make mistakes\n\n11:55.140 --> 12:00.060\n and in so doing discover what it means to be alive,\n\n12:00.060 --> 12:02.060\n discover beauty, because I think\n\n12:02.060 --> 12:04.520\n that's the essential aspect of mistakes.\n\n12:05.380 --> 12:09.300\n Boston Dynamics folks want Spot to be perfect\n\n12:09.300 --> 12:11.620\n because they don't want Spot to ever make mistakes\n\n12:11.620 --> 12:13.540\n because it wants to operate in the factories,\n\n12:13.540 --> 12:16.580\n it wants to be very safe and so on.\n\n12:16.580 --> 12:19.060\n For me, if you construct the environment,\n\n12:19.060 --> 12:21.420\n if you construct a safe space for robots\n\n12:22.300 --> 12:24.360\n and allow them to make mistakes,\n\n12:24.360 --> 12:26.740\n something beautiful might be discovered,\n\n12:26.740 --> 12:29.820\n but that requires a lot of brain power.\n\n12:29.820 --> 12:32.060\n So Spot is currently very dumb\n\n12:32.060 --> 12:34.300\n and I'm gonna give it a brain.\n\n12:34.300 --> 12:36.740\n So first make it see, currently it can't see,\n\n12:36.740 --> 12:39.220\n meaning computer vision, it has to understand\n\n12:39.220 --> 12:41.340\n its environment, it has to see all the humans,\n\n12:41.340 --> 12:43.900\n but then also has to be able to learn,\n\n12:43.900 --> 12:47.480\n learn about its movement, learn how to use its body\n\n12:47.480 --> 12:49.940\n to communicate with others, all those kinds of things\n\n12:49.940 --> 12:51.820\n that dogs know how to do well,\n\n12:51.820 --> 12:54.020\n humans know how to do somewhat well.\n\n12:54.960 --> 12:56.540\n I think that's a beautiful challenge,\n\n12:56.540 --> 13:00.380\n but first you have to allow the robot to make mistakes.\n\n13:00.380 --> 13:03.820\n Well, I think your objective is laudable,\n\n13:03.820 --> 13:04.860\n but you're gonna realize\n\n13:04.860 --> 13:07.380\n that the Boston Dynamics folks are right\n\n13:07.380 --> 13:09.300\n the first time Spot poops on your rug.\n\n13:11.580 --> 13:13.900\n I hear the same thing about kids and so on.\n\n13:13.900 --> 13:14.980\n I still wanna have kids.\n\n13:14.980 --> 13:18.060\n No, you should, it's a great experience.\n\n13:18.060 --> 13:19.780\n So let me step back into what you said\n\n13:19.780 --> 13:21.260\n in a couple of different places.\n\n13:21.260 --> 13:24.740\n One, I have always believed that the missing element\n\n13:24.740 --> 13:27.940\n in robotics and artificial intelligence\n\n13:27.940 --> 13:30.420\n is a proper development, right?\n\n13:30.420 --> 13:33.620\n It is no accident, it is no mere coincidence\n\n13:33.620 --> 13:36.400\n that human beings are the most dominant species\n\n13:36.400 --> 13:38.880\n on planet Earth and that we have the longest childhoods\n\n13:38.880 --> 13:42.020\n of any creature on Earth by far, right?\n\n13:42.020 --> 13:44.860\n The development is the key to the flexibility.\n\n13:44.860 --> 13:49.860\n And so the capability of a human at adulthood\n\n13:49.860 --> 13:53.780\n is the mirror image, it's the flip side\n\n13:53.780 --> 13:57.300\n of our helplessness at birth.\n\n13:57.300 --> 13:59.900\n So I'll be very interested to see what happens\n\n13:59.900 --> 14:03.260\n in your robot project if you do not end up\n\n14:03.260 --> 14:05.420\n reinventing childhood for robots,\n\n14:05.420 --> 14:09.740\n which of course is foreshadowed in 2001 quite brilliantly.\n\n14:10.820 --> 14:12.140\n But I also wanna point out,\n\n14:12.140 --> 14:16.580\n you can see this issue of your conscious mind\n\n14:16.580 --> 14:18.780\n becoming a spectator very well\n\n14:18.780 --> 14:23.780\n if you compare tennis to table tennis, right?\n\n14:24.740 --> 14:28.640\n If you watch a tennis game, you could imagine\n\n14:28.640 --> 14:31.300\n that the players are highly conscious as they play.\n\n14:32.500 --> 14:33.900\n You cannot imagine that\n\n14:33.900 --> 14:36.680\n if you've ever played ping pong decently.\n\n14:36.680 --> 14:39.440\n A volley in ping pong is so fast\n\n14:39.440 --> 14:42.200\n that your conscious mind, if your reactions\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:43.740\n had to go through your conscious mind,\n\n14:43.740 --> 14:44.980\n you wouldn't be able to play.\n\n14:44.980 --> 14:47.140\n So you can detect that your conscious mind,\n\n14:47.140 --> 14:49.740\n while very much present, isn't there.\n\n14:49.740 --> 14:52.140\n And you can also detect where consciousness\n\n14:52.140 --> 14:54.540\n does usefully intrude.\n\n14:54.540 --> 14:57.760\n If you go up against an opponent in table tennis\n\n14:57.760 --> 15:01.780\n that knows a trick that you don't know how to respond to,\n\n15:01.780 --> 15:03.500\n you will suddenly detect that something\n\n15:03.500 --> 15:06.260\n about your game is not effective,\n\n15:06.260 --> 15:08.220\n and you will start thinking about what might be,\n\n15:08.220 --> 15:10.220\n how do you position yourself so that move\n\n15:10.220 --> 15:12.460\n that puts the ball just in that corner of the table\n\n15:12.460 --> 15:15.440\n or something like that doesn't catch you off guard.\n\n15:15.440 --> 15:20.440\n And this, I believe, is we highly conscious folks,\n\n15:22.160 --> 15:23.900\n those of us who try to think through things\n\n15:23.900 --> 15:26.060\n very deliberately and carefully,\n\n15:26.060 --> 15:30.280\n mistake consciousness for the highest kind of thinking.\n\n15:30.280 --> 15:33.120\n And I really think that this is an error.\n\n15:33.120 --> 15:36.280\n Consciousness is an intermediate level of thinking.\n\n15:36.280 --> 15:37.720\n What it does is it allows you,\n\n15:37.720 --> 15:40.120\n it's basically like uncompiled code.\n\n15:40.120 --> 15:42.620\n And it doesn't run very fast.\n\n15:42.620 --> 15:45.400\n It is capable of being adapted to new circumstances.\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:48.460\n But once the code is roughed in,\n\n15:48.460 --> 15:50.500\n it gets driven into the unconscious layer,\n\n15:50.500 --> 15:52.860\n and you become highly effective at whatever it is.\n\n15:52.860 --> 15:55.260\n And from that point, your conscious mind\n\n15:55.260 --> 15:57.260\n basically remains there to detect things\n\n15:57.260 --> 16:00.040\n that aren't anticipated by the code you've already written.\n\n16:00.040 --> 16:05.040\n And so I don't exactly know how one would establish this,\n\n16:05.340 --> 16:07.220\n how one would demonstrate it.\n\n16:07.220 --> 16:10.580\n But it must be the case that the human mind\n\n16:10.580 --> 16:15.400\n contains sandboxes in which things are tested, right?\n\n16:15.400 --> 16:16.840\n Maybe you can build a piece of code\n\n16:16.840 --> 16:19.880\n and run it in parallel next to your active code\n\n16:19.880 --> 16:23.600\n so you can see how it would have done comparatively.\n\n16:23.600 --> 16:26.480\n But there's gotta be some way of writing new code\n\n16:26.480 --> 16:28.000\n and then swapping it in.\n\n16:28.000 --> 16:29.720\n And frankly, I think this has a lot to do\n\n16:29.720 --> 16:31.240\n with things like sleep cycles.\n\n16:31.240 --> 16:34.100\n Very often, when I get good at something,\n\n16:34.100 --> 16:36.720\n I often don't get better at it while I'm doing it.\n\n16:36.720 --> 16:38.680\n I get better at it when I'm not doing it,\n\n16:38.680 --> 16:41.720\n especially if there's time to sleep and think on it.\n\n16:41.720 --> 16:44.440\n So there's some sort of new program\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:46.940\n swapping in for old program phenomenon,\n\n16:46.940 --> 16:50.880\n which will be a lot easier to see in machines.\n\n16:50.880 --> 16:53.800\n It's gonna be hard with the wetware.\n\n16:53.800 --> 16:55.520\n I like, I mean, it is true,\n\n16:55.520 --> 16:56.760\n because somebody that played,\n\n16:56.760 --> 16:58.760\n I played tennis for many years,\n\n16:58.760 --> 17:01.880\n I do still think the highest form of excellence in tennis\n\n17:01.880 --> 17:05.200\n is when the conscious mind is a spectator.\n\n17:05.200 --> 17:10.200\n So the compiled code is the highest form of being human.\n\n17:11.600 --> 17:16.360\n And then consciousness is just some specific compiler.\n\n17:16.360 --> 17:19.760\n You used to have like Borland C++ compiler.\n\n17:19.760 --> 17:22.160\n You could just have different kind of compilers.\n\n17:22.160 --> 17:26.120\n Ultimately, the thing that by which we measure\n\n17:28.560 --> 17:30.600\n the power of life, the intelligence of life\n\n17:30.600 --> 17:31.800\n is the compiled code.\n\n17:31.800 --> 17:34.880\n And you can probably do that compilation all kinds of ways.\n\n17:34.880 --> 17:37.780\n Yeah, I'm not saying that tennis is played consciously\n\n17:37.780 --> 17:38.880\n and table tennis isn't.\n\n17:38.880 --> 17:41.460\n I'm saying that because tennis is slowed down\n\n17:41.460 --> 17:43.760\n by the just the space on the court,\n\n17:43.760 --> 17:47.080\n you could imagine that it was your conscious mind playing.\n\n17:47.080 --> 17:48.840\n But when you shrink the court down,\n\n17:48.840 --> 17:49.680\n It becomes obvious.\n\n17:49.680 --> 17:51.400\n It becomes obvious that your conscious mind\n\n17:51.400 --> 17:54.760\n is just present rather than knowing where to put the paddle.\n\n17:54.760 --> 17:56.460\n And weirdly for me,\n\n17:58.560 --> 17:59.740\n I would say this probably isn't true\n\n17:59.740 --> 18:01.760\n in a podcast situation.\n\n18:01.760 --> 18:03.960\n But if I have to give a presentation,\n\n18:03.960 --> 18:06.960\n especially if I have not overly prepared,\n\n18:06.960 --> 18:08.760\n I often find the same phenomenon\n\n18:08.760 --> 18:10.080\n when I'm giving the presentation.\n\n18:10.080 --> 18:11.600\n My conscious mind is there watching\n\n18:11.600 --> 18:13.600\n some other part of me present,\n\n18:13.600 --> 18:17.440\n which is a little jarring, I have to say.\n\n18:17.440 --> 18:20.680\n Well, that means you've gotten good at it.\n\n18:20.680 --> 18:22.520\n Not let the conscious mind get in the way\n\n18:22.520 --> 18:24.720\n of the flow of words.\n\n18:24.720 --> 18:27.120\n Yeah, that's the sensation to be sure.\n\n18:27.120 --> 18:29.040\n And that's the highest form of podcasting too.\n\n18:29.040 --> 18:32.240\n I mean, that's what it looks like\n\n18:32.240 --> 18:34.200\n when a podcast is really in the pocket,\n\n18:34.200 --> 18:38.640\n like Joe Rogan, just having fun\n\n18:38.640 --> 18:39.880\n and just losing themselves.\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:41.860\n And that's something I aspire to as well,\n\n18:41.860 --> 18:43.500\n just losing yourself in conversation.\n\n18:43.500 --> 18:45.680\n Somebody that has a lot of anxiety with people,\n\n18:45.680 --> 18:47.200\n like I'm such an introvert.\n\n18:47.200 --> 18:48.040\n I'm scared.\n\n18:48.040 --> 18:49.280\n I was scared before you showed up.\n\n18:49.280 --> 18:50.920\n I'm scared right now.\n\n18:50.920 --> 18:52.080\n There's just anxiety.\n\n18:52.080 --> 18:55.200\n There's just, it's a giant mess.\n\n18:55.200 --> 18:56.600\n It's hard to lose yourself.\n\n18:56.600 --> 19:00.700\n It's hard to just get out of the way of your own mind.\n\n19:00.700 --> 19:04.960\n Yeah, actually, trust is a big component of that.\n\n19:04.960 --> 19:08.080\n Your conscious mind retains control\n\n19:08.080 --> 19:10.040\n if you are very uncertain.\n\n19:11.080 --> 19:14.280\n But when you do get into that zone when you're speaking,\n\n19:14.280 --> 19:15.440\n I realize it's different for you\n\n19:15.440 --> 19:16.740\n with English as a second language,\n\n19:16.740 --> 19:20.280\n although maybe you present in Russian and it happens.\n\n19:20.280 --> 19:22.560\n But do you ever hear yourself say something\n\n19:22.560 --> 19:25.080\n and you think, oh, that's really good, right?\n\n19:25.080 --> 19:26.980\n Like you didn't come up with it,\n\n19:26.980 --> 19:30.160\n some other part of you that you don't exactly know\n\n19:30.160 --> 19:31.000\n came up with it?\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:36.000\n I don't think I've ever heard myself in that way\n\n19:36.240 --> 19:38.180\n because I have a much louder voice\n\n19:38.180 --> 19:41.360\n that's constantly yelling in my head at,\n\n19:41.360 --> 19:43.520\n why the hell did you say that?\n\n19:43.520 --> 19:47.360\n There's a very self critical voice that's much louder.\n\n19:47.360 --> 19:51.320\n So I'm very, maybe I need to deal with that voice,\n\n19:51.320 --> 19:53.160\n but it's been like, what is it called?\n\n19:53.160 --> 19:54.640\n Like a megaphone just screaming\n\n19:54.640 --> 19:56.600\n so I can't hear the other voice that says,\n\n19:56.600 --> 19:58.600\n good job, you said that thing really nicely.\n\n19:58.600 --> 20:02.320\n So I'm kind of focused right now on the megaphone person\n\n20:02.320 --> 20:05.320\n in the audience versus the positive,\n\n20:05.320 --> 20:07.200\n but that's definitely something to think about.\n\n20:07.200 --> 20:12.200\n It's been productive, but the place where I find gratitude\n\n20:12.960 --> 20:16.960\n and beauty and appreciation of life is in the quiet moments\n\n20:16.960 --> 20:20.360\n when I don't talk, when I listen to the world around me,\n\n20:20.360 --> 20:23.880\n when I listen to others, when I talk,\n\n20:23.880 --> 20:26.800\n I'm extremely self critical in my mind.\n\n20:26.800 --> 20:29.640\n When I produce anything out into the world\n\n20:29.640 --> 20:32.000\n that originated with me,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:35.040\n like any kind of creation, extremely self critical.\n\n20:35.040 --> 20:37.440\n It's good for productivity,\n\n20:37.440 --> 20:40.760\n for always striving to improve and so on.\n\n20:40.760 --> 20:45.040\n It might be bad for just appreciating\n\n20:45.040 --> 20:46.160\n the things you've created.\n\n20:46.160 --> 20:49.600\n I'm a little bit with Marvin Minsky on this\n\n20:49.600 --> 20:54.600\n where he says the key to a productive life\n\n20:54.600 --> 20:57.980\n is to hate everything you've ever done in the past.\n\n20:57.980 --> 20:59.300\n I didn't know he said that.\n\n20:59.300 --> 21:01.260\n I must say, I resonate with it a bit.\n\n21:01.260 --> 21:06.260\n And unfortunately, my life currently has me putting\n\n21:06.580 --> 21:08.660\n a lot of stuff into the world,\n\n21:08.660 --> 21:12.020\n and I effectively watch almost none of it.\n\n21:12.020 --> 21:12.900\n I can't stand it.\n\n21:15.020 --> 21:16.780\n Yeah, what do you make of that?\n\n21:16.780 --> 21:18.020\n I don't know.\n\n21:18.020 --> 21:21.700\n I just yesterday read Metamorphosis by Kafka,\n\n21:21.700 --> 21:23.620\n we read Metamorphosis by Kafka\n\n21:23.620 --> 21:25.820\n where he turns into a giant bug\n\n21:25.820 --> 21:29.060\n because of the stress that the world puts on him.\n\n21:29.060 --> 21:31.620\n His parents put on him to succeed.\n\n21:31.620 --> 21:35.500\n And I think that you have to find the balance\n\n21:35.500 --> 21:39.620\n because if you allow the self critical voice\n\n21:39.620 --> 21:41.780\n to become too heavy, the burden of the world,\n\n21:41.780 --> 21:44.140\n the pressure that the world puts on you\n\n21:44.140 --> 21:47.340\n to be the best version of yourself and so on to strive,\n\n21:47.340 --> 21:51.780\n then you become a bug and that's a big problem.\n\n21:51.780 --> 21:56.700\n And then the world turns against you because you're a bug.\n\n21:56.700 --> 21:59.760\n You become some kind of caricature of yourself.\n\n21:59.760 --> 22:03.900\n I don't know, you become the worst version of yourself\n\n22:03.900 --> 22:07.940\n and then thereby end up destroying yourself\n\n22:07.940 --> 22:09.580\n and then the world moves on.\n\n22:09.580 --> 22:10.420\n That's the story.\n\n22:10.420 --> 22:11.500\n That's a lovely story.\n\n22:12.460 --> 22:14.820\n I do think this is one of these places,\n\n22:14.820 --> 22:17.700\n and frankly, you could map this onto\n\n22:17.700 --> 22:19.500\n all of modern human experience,\n\n22:19.500 --> 22:20.820\n but this is one of these places\n\n22:20.820 --> 22:23.300\n where our ancestral programming\n\n22:23.300 --> 22:25.620\n does not serve our modern selves.\n\n22:25.620 --> 22:27.240\n So I used to talk to students\n\n22:27.240 --> 22:30.740\n about the question of dwelling on things.\n\n22:30.740 --> 22:34.340\n Dwelling on things is famously understood to be bad\n\n22:35.300 --> 22:36.700\n and it can't possibly be bad.\n\n22:36.700 --> 22:38.300\n It wouldn't exist, the tendency toward it\n\n22:38.300 --> 22:40.300\n wouldn't exist if it was bad.\n\n22:40.300 --> 22:42.700\n So what is bad is dwelling on things\n\n22:42.700 --> 22:45.360\n past the point of utility.\n\n22:45.360 --> 22:49.660\n And that's obviously easier to say than to operationalize,\n\n22:49.660 --> 22:53.300\n but if you realize that your dwelling is the key, in fact,\n\n22:53.300 --> 22:57.000\n to upgrading your program for future well being\n\n22:57.940 --> 23:00.100\n and that there's a point, presumably,\n\n23:00.100 --> 23:03.780\n from diminishing returns, if not counter productivity,\n\n23:03.780 --> 23:05.620\n there is a point at which you should stop\n\n23:05.620 --> 23:08.340\n because that is what is in your best interest,\n\n23:08.340 --> 23:12.140\n then knowing that you're looking for that point is useful.\n\n23:12.140 --> 23:14.100\n This is the point at which it is no longer useful\n\n23:14.100 --> 23:16.900\n for me to dwell on this error I have made.\n\n23:16.900 --> 23:17.980\n That's what you're looking for.\n\n23:17.980 --> 23:20.940\n And it also gives you license, right?\n\n23:20.940 --> 23:23.820\n If some part of you feels like it's punishing you\n\n23:23.820 --> 23:27.980\n rather than searching, then that also has a point\n\n23:27.980 --> 23:29.700\n at which it's no longer valuable\n\n23:29.700 --> 23:32.420\n and there's some liberty in realizing,\n\n23:32.420 --> 23:35.260\n yep, even the part of me that was punishing me\n\n23:35.260 --> 23:36.420\n knows it's time to stop.\n\n23:37.340 --> 23:40.460\n So if we map that onto compiled code discussion,\n\n23:40.460 --> 23:43.220\n as a computer science person, I find that very compelling.\n\n23:43.220 --> 23:48.220\n You know, when you compile code, you get warnings sometimes.\n\n23:48.700 --> 23:53.700\n And usually, if you're a good software engineer,\n\n23:54.100 --> 23:56.500\n you're going to make sure there's no,\n\n23:56.500 --> 23:58.900\n you know, you treat warnings as errors.\n\n23:58.900 --> 24:02.260\n So you make sure that the compilation produces no warnings.\n\n24:02.260 --> 24:05.180\n But at a certain point, when you have a large enough system,\n\n24:05.180 --> 24:06.820\n you just let the warnings go.\n\n24:06.820 --> 24:07.860\n It's fine.\n\n24:07.860 --> 24:10.380\n Like, I don't know where that warning came from,\n\n24:10.380 --> 24:15.140\n but, you know, just ultimately you need to compile the code\n\n24:15.140 --> 24:19.180\n and run with it and hope nothing terrible happens.\n\n24:19.180 --> 24:21.620\n Well, I think what you will find, and believe me,\n\n24:21.620 --> 24:24.500\n I think what you're talking about\n\n24:24.500 --> 24:27.700\n with respect to robots and learning\n\n24:27.700 --> 24:31.900\n is gonna end up having to go to a deep developmental state\n\n24:31.900 --> 24:34.940\n and a helplessness that evolves into hyper competence\n\n24:34.940 --> 24:36.020\n and all of that.\n\n24:36.020 --> 24:41.020\n But I live, I noticed that I live by something\n\n24:41.460 --> 24:44.140\n that I, for lack of a better descriptor,\n\n24:44.140 --> 24:46.060\n call the theory of close calls.\n\n24:47.140 --> 24:50.900\n And the theory of close calls says that people\n\n24:50.900 --> 24:55.820\n typically miscategorize the events in their life\n\n24:55.820 --> 24:57.820\n where something almost went wrong.\n\n24:58.940 --> 25:01.060\n And, you know, for example, if you,\n\n25:01.060 --> 25:04.740\n I have a friend who, I was walking down the street\n\n25:04.740 --> 25:06.740\n with my college friends and one of my friends\n\n25:06.740 --> 25:08.700\n stepped into the street thinking it was clear\n\n25:08.700 --> 25:12.060\n and was nearly hit by a car going 45 miles an hour,\n\n25:12.060 --> 25:14.940\n would have been an absolute disaster, might have killed her,\n\n25:14.940 --> 25:17.340\n certainly would have permanently injured her.\n\n25:18.500 --> 25:21.700\n But she didn't, you know, car didn't touch her, right?\n\n25:21.700 --> 25:25.220\n Now you could walk away from that and think nothing of it\n\n25:25.220 --> 25:26.660\n because, well, what is there to think?\n\n25:26.660 --> 25:28.220\n Nothing happened.\n\n25:28.220 --> 25:30.660\n Or you could think, well, what is the difference\n\n25:30.660 --> 25:33.540\n between what did happen and my death?\n\n25:33.540 --> 25:35.100\n The difference is luck.\n\n25:35.100 --> 25:37.340\n I never want that to be true, right?\n\n25:37.340 --> 25:40.020\n I never want the difference between what did happen\n\n25:40.020 --> 25:41.620\n and my death to be luck.\n\n25:41.620 --> 25:45.260\n Therefore, I should count this as very close to death\n\n25:45.260 --> 25:47.620\n and I should prioritize coding\n\n25:47.620 --> 25:50.420\n so it doesn't happen again at a very high level.\n\n25:50.420 --> 25:52.460\n So anyway, my basic point is\n\n25:53.820 --> 25:58.700\n the accidents and disasters and misfortune\n\n25:58.700 --> 26:02.180\n describe a distribution that tells you\n\n26:02.180 --> 26:04.420\n what's really likely to get you in the end.\n\n26:04.420 --> 26:09.420\n And so personally, you can use them to figure out\n\n26:10.020 --> 26:12.020\n where the dangers are so that you can afford\n\n26:12.020 --> 26:14.380\n to take great risks because you have a really good sense\n\n26:14.380 --> 26:15.780\n of how they're gonna go wrong.\n\n26:15.780 --> 26:19.060\n But I would also point out civilization has this problem.\n\n26:19.060 --> 26:22.900\n Civilization is now producing these events\n\n26:22.900 --> 26:24.420\n that are major disasters,\n\n26:24.420 --> 26:27.500\n but they're not existential scale yet, right?\n\n26:27.500 --> 26:30.100\n They're very serious errors that we can see.\n\n26:30.100 --> 26:32.140\n And I would argue that the pattern is\n\n26:32.140 --> 26:35.140\n you discover that we are involved in some industrial process\n\n26:35.140 --> 26:37.900\n at the point it has gone wrong, right?\n\n26:37.900 --> 26:40.780\n So I'm now always asking the question,\n\n26:40.780 --> 26:44.860\n okay, in light of the Fukushima triple meltdown,\n\n26:44.860 --> 26:46.980\n the financial collapse of 2008,\n\n26:46.980 --> 26:51.660\n the Deepwater Horizon blowout, COVID 19,\n\n26:51.660 --> 26:55.340\n and its probable origins in the Wuhan lab,\n\n26:55.340 --> 26:58.820\n what processes do I not know the name of yet\n\n26:58.820 --> 27:00.460\n that I will discover at the point\n\n27:00.460 --> 27:03.060\n that some gigantic accident has happened?\n\n27:03.060 --> 27:06.180\n And can we talk about the wisdom or lack thereof\n\n27:06.180 --> 27:09.060\n of engaging in that process before the accident, right?\n\n27:09.060 --> 27:11.460\n That's what a wise civilization would be doing.\n\n27:11.460 --> 27:12.900\n And yet we don't.\n\n27:12.900 --> 27:15.100\n I just wanna mention something that happened\n\n27:15.100 --> 27:17.140\n a couple of days ago.\n\n27:17.140 --> 27:20.020\n I don't know if you know who JB Straubel is.\n\n27:20.020 --> 27:21.780\n He's the co founder of Tesla,\n\n27:21.780 --> 27:24.060\n CTO of Tesla for many, many years.\n\n27:24.060 --> 27:26.340\n His wife just died.\n\n27:26.340 --> 27:28.580\n She was riding a bicycle.\n\n27:28.580 --> 27:33.580\n And in the same thin line between death and life\n\n27:35.260 --> 27:37.460\n that many of us have been in,\n\n27:37.460 --> 27:39.540\n where you walk into the intersection\n\n27:39.540 --> 27:41.820\n and there's this close call.\n\n27:41.820 --> 27:46.820\n Every once in a while, you get the short straw.\n\n27:50.900 --> 27:54.980\n I wonder how much of our own individual lives\n\n27:54.980 --> 27:57.540\n and the entirety of the human civilization\n\n27:57.540 --> 27:59.780\n rests on this little roll of the dice.\n\n28:00.860 --> 28:03.300\n Well, this is sort of my point about the close calls\n\n28:03.300 --> 28:06.780\n is that there's a level at which we can't control it, right?\n\n28:06.780 --> 28:11.100\n The gigantic asteroid that comes from deep space\n\n28:11.100 --> 28:13.060\n that you don't have time to do anything about.\n\n28:13.060 --> 28:15.620\n There's not a lot we can do to hedge that out,\n\n28:15.620 --> 28:16.940\n or at least not short term.\n\n28:17.900 --> 28:20.420\n But there are lots of other things.\n\n28:20.420 --> 28:23.780\n Obviously, the financial collapse of 2008\n\n28:23.780 --> 28:27.060\n didn't break down the entire world economy.\n\n28:27.060 --> 28:28.900\n It threatened to, but a Herculean effort\n\n28:28.900 --> 28:31.100\n managed to pull us back from the brink.\n\n28:31.100 --> 28:34.380\n The triple meltdown at Fukushima was awful,\n\n28:34.380 --> 28:37.380\n but every one of the seven fuel pools held,\n\n28:37.380 --> 28:39.580\n there wasn't a major fire that made it impossible\n\n28:39.580 --> 28:41.660\n to manage the disaster going forward.\n\n28:41.660 --> 28:42.660\n We got lucky.\n\n28:44.620 --> 28:47.820\n We could say the same thing about the blowout\n\n28:47.820 --> 28:49.580\n at the Deepwater Horizon,\n\n28:49.580 --> 28:52.460\n where a hole in the ocean floor large enough\n\n28:52.460 --> 28:54.340\n that we couldn't have plugged it, could have opened up.\n\n28:54.340 --> 28:57.500\n All of these things could have been much, much worse, right?\n\n28:57.500 --> 28:59.140\n And I think we can say the same thing about COVID,\n\n28:59.140 --> 29:00.980\n as terrible as it is.\n\n29:00.980 --> 29:04.740\n And we cannot say for sure that it came from the Wuhan lab,\n\n29:04.740 --> 29:06.980\n but there's a strong likelihood that it did.\n\n29:06.980 --> 29:10.300\n And it also could be much, much worse.\n\n29:10.300 --> 29:13.820\n So in each of these cases, something is telling us,\n\n29:13.820 --> 29:16.340\n we have a process that is unfolding\n\n29:16.340 --> 29:18.600\n that keeps creating risks where it is luck\n\n29:18.600 --> 29:19.900\n that is the difference between us\n\n29:19.900 --> 29:22.700\n and some scale of disaster that is unimaginable.\n\n29:22.700 --> 29:26.700\n And that wisdom, you can be highly intelligent\n\n29:26.700 --> 29:28.900\n and cause these disasters.\n\n29:28.900 --> 29:31.780\n To be wise is to stop causing them, right?\n\n29:31.780 --> 29:36.580\n And that would require a process of restraint,\n\n29:36.580 --> 29:38.880\n a process that I don't see a lot of evidence of yet.\n\n29:38.880 --> 29:41.880\n So I think we have to generate it.\n\n29:41.880 --> 29:45.540\n And somehow, at the moment,\n\n29:45.540 --> 29:47.460\n we don't have a political structure\n\n29:47.460 --> 29:51.540\n that would be capable of taking\n\n29:51.540 --> 29:55.740\n a protective algorithm and actually deploying it, right?\n\n29:55.740 --> 29:57.780\n Because it would have important economic consequences.\n\n29:57.780 --> 30:00.380\n And so it would almost certainly be shot down.\n\n30:00.380 --> 30:03.380\n But we can obviously also say,\n\n30:03.380 --> 30:07.020\n we paid a huge price for all of the disasters\n\n30:07.020 --> 30:09.360\n that I've mentioned.\n\n30:09.360 --> 30:12.060\n And we have to factor that into the equation.\n\n30:12.060 --> 30:13.840\n Something can be very productive short term\n\n30:13.840 --> 30:15.380\n and very destructive long term.\n\n30:17.100 --> 30:20.900\n Also, the question is how many disasters we avoided\n\n30:20.900 --> 30:23.980\n because of the ingenuity of humans\n\n30:23.980 --> 30:26.760\n or just the integrity and character of humans.\n\n30:28.020 --> 30:30.260\n That's sort of an open question.\n\n30:30.260 --> 30:35.260\n We may be more intelligent than lucky.\n\n30:35.800 --> 30:36.900\n That's the hope.\n\n30:36.900 --> 30:40.060\n Because the optimistic message here that you're getting at\n\n30:40.060 --> 30:43.720\n is maybe the process that we should be,\n\n30:44.980 --> 30:48.520\n that maybe we can overcome luck with ingenuity.\n\n30:48.520 --> 30:51.940\n Meaning, I guess you're suggesting the processes\n\n30:51.940 --> 30:53.700\n we should be listing all the ways\n\n30:53.700 --> 30:55.860\n that human civilization can destroy itself,\n\n30:57.100 --> 30:58.980\n assigning likelihood to it,\n\n30:59.940 --> 31:03.180\n and thinking through how can we avoid that.\n\n31:03.180 --> 31:06.700\n And being very honest with the data out there\n\n31:06.700 --> 31:10.500\n about the close calls and using those close calls\n\n31:10.500 --> 31:13.900\n to then create sort of mechanism\n\n31:13.900 --> 31:17.420\n by which we minimize the probability of those close calls.\n\n31:17.420 --> 31:21.220\n And just being honest and transparent\n\n31:21.220 --> 31:23.140\n with the data that's out there.\n\n31:23.140 --> 31:26.220\n Well, I think we need to do a couple things for it to work.\n\n31:27.640 --> 31:30.060\n So I've been an advocate for the idea\n\n31:30.060 --> 31:32.060\n that sustainability is actually,\n\n31:32.060 --> 31:33.660\n it's difficult to operationalize,\n\n31:33.660 --> 31:35.900\n but it is an objective that we have to meet\n\n31:35.900 --> 31:38.540\n if we're to be around long term.\n\n31:38.540 --> 31:41.460\n And I realized that we also need to have reversibility\n\n31:41.460 --> 31:43.300\n of all of our processes.\n\n31:43.300 --> 31:46.320\n Because processes very frequently when they start\n\n31:46.320 --> 31:47.940\n do not appear dangerous.\n\n31:47.940 --> 31:51.260\n And then when they scale, they become very dangerous.\n\n31:51.260 --> 31:53.160\n So for example, if you imagine\n\n31:54.280 --> 31:58.300\n the first internal combustion engine vehicle\n\n31:58.300 --> 31:59.680\n driving down the street,\n\n31:59.680 --> 32:01.740\n and you imagine somebody running after them saying,\n\n32:01.740 --> 32:02.980\n hey, if you do enough of that,\n\n32:02.980 --> 32:04.280\n you're gonna alter the atmosphere\n\n32:04.280 --> 32:05.960\n and it's gonna change the temperature of the planet.\n\n32:05.960 --> 32:07.420\n It's preposterous, right?\n\n32:07.420 --> 32:08.580\n Why would you stop the person\n\n32:08.580 --> 32:10.900\n who's invented this marvelous new contraption?\n\n32:10.900 --> 32:13.140\n But of course, eventually you do get to the place\n\n32:13.140 --> 32:14.620\n where you're doing enough of this\n\n32:14.620 --> 32:17.060\n that you do start changing the temperature of the planet.\n\n32:17.060 --> 32:20.460\n So if we built the capacity,\n\n32:20.460 --> 32:23.780\n if we basically said, look, you can't involve yourself\n\n32:23.780 --> 32:27.540\n in any process that you couldn't reverse if you had to,\n\n32:27.540 --> 32:30.180\n then progress would be slowed,\n\n32:30.180 --> 32:33.300\n but our safety would go up dramatically.\n\n32:33.300 --> 32:38.120\n And I think in some sense, if we are to be around long term,\n\n32:38.120 --> 32:40.300\n we have to begin thinking that way.\n\n32:40.300 --> 32:43.880\n We're just involved in too many very dangerous processes.\n\n32:43.880 --> 32:46.860\n So let's talk about one of the things\n\n32:46.860 --> 32:50.300\n that if not threatened human civilization\n\n32:50.300 --> 32:54.940\n certainly hurt it at a deep level, which is COVID 19.\n\n32:56.700 --> 32:59.500\n What percent probability would you currently place\n\n33:00.380 --> 33:02.500\n on the hypothesis that COVID 19 leaked\n\n33:02.500 --> 33:06.300\n from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\n\n33:06.300 --> 33:10.780\n So I maintain a flow chart of all the possible explanations,\n\n33:10.780 --> 33:14.280\n and it doesn't break down exactly that way.\n\n33:15.300 --> 33:19.140\n The likelihood that it emerged from a lab is very, very high.\n\n33:20.140 --> 33:21.380\n If it emerged from a lab,\n\n33:21.380 --> 33:23.580\n the likelihood that the lab was the Wuhan Institute\n\n33:23.580 --> 33:24.740\n is very, very high.\n\n33:27.920 --> 33:30.500\n There are multiple different kinds of evidence\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:31.660\n that point to the lab,\n\n33:31.660 --> 33:35.060\n and there is literally no evidence that points to nature.\n\n33:35.060 --> 33:38.180\n Either the evidence points nowhere or it points to the lab,\n\n33:38.180 --> 33:39.900\n and the lab could mean any lab,\n\n33:39.900 --> 33:41.900\n but geographically, obviously,\n\n33:41.900 --> 33:44.920\n the labs in Wuhan are the most likely,\n\n33:44.920 --> 33:46.720\n and the lab that was most directly involved\n\n33:46.720 --> 33:50.340\n with research on viruses that look like COVID,\n\n33:50.340 --> 33:52.200\n that look like SARS COVID 2,\n\n33:52.200 --> 33:55.820\n is obviously the place that one would start.\n\n33:55.820 --> 33:59.640\n But I would say the likelihood that this virus\n\n33:59.640 --> 34:04.100\n came from a lab is well above 95%.\n\n34:04.100 --> 34:06.740\n We can talk about the question of could a virus\n\n34:06.740 --> 34:08.740\n have been brought into the lab and escaped from there\n\n34:08.740 --> 34:09.900\n without being modified.\n\n34:09.900 --> 34:11.220\n That's also possible,\n\n34:11.220 --> 34:13.700\n but it doesn't explain any of the anomalies\n\n34:13.700 --> 34:16.520\n in the genome of SARS COVID 2.\n\n34:17.960 --> 34:20.680\n Could it have been delivered from another lab?\n\n34:20.680 --> 34:23.140\n Could Wuhan be a distraction\n\n34:23.140 --> 34:26.600\n in order that we would connect the dots in the wrong way?\n\n34:26.600 --> 34:27.620\n That's conceivable.\n\n34:27.620 --> 34:30.620\n I currently have that below 1% on my flowchart,\n\n34:30.620 --> 34:31.440\n but I think...\n\n34:31.440 --> 34:34.180\n A very dark thought that somebody would do that\n\n34:34.180 --> 34:37.740\n almost as a political attack on China.\n\n34:37.740 --> 34:39.100\n Well, it depends.\n\n34:39.100 --> 34:42.380\n I don't even think that's one possibility.\n\n34:42.380 --> 34:44.460\n Sometimes when Eric and I talk about these issues,\n\n34:44.460 --> 34:48.260\n we will generate a scenario just to prove\n\n34:48.260 --> 34:51.060\n that something could live in that space, right?\n\n34:51.060 --> 34:53.820\n It's a placeholder for whatever may actually have happened.\n\n34:53.820 --> 34:57.300\n And so it doesn't have to have been an attack on China.\n\n34:57.300 --> 34:59.280\n That's certainly one possibility.\n\n34:59.280 --> 35:00.700\n But I would point out,\n\n35:01.740 --> 35:06.740\n if you can predict the future in some unusual way\n\n35:06.740 --> 35:10.260\n better than others, you can print money, right?\n\n35:10.260 --> 35:12.380\n That's what markets that allow you to bet for\n\n35:12.380 --> 35:16.980\n or against virtually any sector allow you to do.\n\n35:16.980 --> 35:21.980\n So you can imagine a simply amoral person\n\n35:23.260 --> 35:26.380\n or entity generating a pandemic,\n\n35:26.380 --> 35:28.260\n attempting to cover their tracks\n\n35:28.260 --> 35:30.520\n because it would allow them to bet against things\n\n35:30.520 --> 35:35.100\n like cruise ships, air travel, whatever it is,\n\n35:35.100 --> 35:37.860\n and bet in favor of, I don't know,\n\n35:39.540 --> 35:43.300\n sanitizing gel and whatever else you would do.\n\n35:43.300 --> 35:46.400\n So am I saying that I think somebody did that?\n\n35:46.400 --> 35:47.740\n No, I really don't think it happened.\n\n35:47.740 --> 35:49.020\n We've seen zero evidence\n\n35:49.020 --> 35:51.340\n that this was intentionally released.\n\n35:51.340 --> 35:54.780\n However, were it to have been intentionally released\n\n35:54.780 --> 35:56.180\n by somebody who did not know,\n\n35:56.180 --> 35:59.260\n did not want it known where it had come from,\n\n35:59.260 --> 36:00.980\n releasing it into Wuhan would be one way\n\n36:00.980 --> 36:01.860\n to cover their tracks.\n\n36:01.860 --> 36:05.140\n So we have to leave the possibility formally open,\n\n36:05.140 --> 36:07.420\n but acknowledge there's no evidence.\n\n36:07.420 --> 36:09.340\n And the probability therefore is low.\n\n36:09.340 --> 36:13.740\n I tend to believe maybe this is the optimistic nature\n\n36:13.740 --> 36:18.480\n that I have that people who are competent enough\n\n36:18.480 --> 36:20.660\n to do the kind of thing we just described\n\n36:21.740 --> 36:23.100\n are not going to do that\n\n36:23.100 --> 36:26.220\n because it requires a certain kind of,\n\n36:26.220 --> 36:27.420\n I don't wanna use the word evil,\n\n36:27.420 --> 36:29.260\n but whatever word you wanna use to describe\n\n36:29.260 --> 36:34.260\n the kind of disregard for human life required to do that,\n\n36:36.860 --> 36:40.540\n that's just not going to be coupled with competence.\n\n36:40.540 --> 36:42.460\n I feel like there's a trade off chart\n\n36:42.460 --> 36:45.940\n where competence on one axis and evil is on the other.\n\n36:45.940 --> 36:47.500\n And the more evil you become,\n\n36:48.540 --> 36:52.720\n the crappier you are at doing great engineering,\n\n36:52.720 --> 36:55.740\n scientific work required to deliver weapons\n\n36:55.740 --> 36:57.820\n of different kinds, whether it's bioweapons\n\n36:57.820 --> 36:59.860\n or nuclear weapons, all those kinds of things.\n\n36:59.860 --> 37:02.700\n That seems to be the lessons I take from history,\n\n37:02.700 --> 37:04.380\n but that doesn't necessarily mean\n\n37:04.380 --> 37:06.980\n that's what's going to be happening in the future.\n\n37:08.140 --> 37:11.300\n But to stick on the lab leak idea,\n\n37:11.300 --> 37:13.580\n because the flow chart is probably huge here\n\n37:13.580 --> 37:16.220\n because there's a lot of fascinating possibilities.\n\n37:16.220 --> 37:18.100\n One question I wanna ask is,\n\n37:18.100 --> 37:20.780\n what would evidence for natural origins look like?\n\n37:20.780 --> 37:25.220\n So one piece of evidence for natural origins\n\n37:25.220 --> 37:28.740\n is that it's happened in the past\n\n37:30.100 --> 37:33.580\n that viruses have jumped.\n\n37:33.580 --> 37:35.060\n Oh, they do jump.\n\n37:35.060 --> 37:38.540\n So like that's possible to have happened.\n\n37:39.900 --> 37:42.280\n So that's a sort of like a historical evidence,\n\n37:42.280 --> 37:46.220\n like, okay, well, it's possible that it have...\n\n37:46.220 --> 37:48.100\n It's not evidence of the kind you think it is.\n\n37:48.100 --> 37:52.260\n It's a justification for a presumption, right?\n\n37:52.260 --> 37:54.180\n So the presumption upon discovering\n\n37:54.180 --> 37:55.740\n a new virus circulating is certainly\n\n37:55.740 --> 37:57.860\n that it came from nature, right?\n\n37:57.860 --> 38:00.680\n The problem is the presumption evaporates\n\n38:00.680 --> 38:04.140\n in the face of evidence, or at least it logically should.\n\n38:04.140 --> 38:05.760\n And it didn't in this case.\n\n38:05.760 --> 38:08.260\n It was maintained by people who privately\n\n38:08.260 --> 38:11.760\n in their emails acknowledged that they had grave doubts\n\n38:11.760 --> 38:14.820\n about the natural origin of this virus.\n\n38:14.820 --> 38:17.020\n Is there some other piece of evidence\n\n38:17.020 --> 38:21.780\n that we could look for and see that would say,\n\n38:21.780 --> 38:24.740\n this increases the probability that it's natural origins?\n\n38:24.740 --> 38:27.620\n Yeah, in fact, there is evidence.\n\n38:27.620 --> 38:31.460\n I always worry that somebody is going to make up\n\n38:31.460 --> 38:34.540\n some evidence in order to reverse the flow.\n\n38:34.540 --> 38:35.380\n Oh, boy.\n\n38:35.380 --> 38:36.580\n Well, let's say I am...\n\n38:36.580 --> 38:38.180\n There's a lot of incentive for that actually.\n\n38:38.180 --> 38:39.540\n There's a huge amount of incentive.\n\n38:39.540 --> 38:43.460\n On the other hand, why didn't the powers that be,\n\n38:43.460 --> 38:45.140\n the powers that lied to us about weapons\n\n38:45.140 --> 38:46.340\n of mass destruction in Iraq,\n\n38:46.340 --> 38:48.140\n why didn't they ever fake weapons\n\n38:48.140 --> 38:49.740\n of mass destruction in Iraq?\n\n38:49.740 --> 38:52.660\n Whatever force it is, I hope that force is here too.\n\n38:52.660 --> 38:54.940\n And so whatever evidence we find is real.\n\n38:54.940 --> 38:56.820\n It's the competence thing I'm talking about,\n\n38:56.820 --> 38:58.900\n but okay, go ahead, sorry.\n\n38:58.900 --> 39:00.180\n Well, we can get back to that.\n\n39:00.180 --> 39:03.860\n But I would say, yeah, the giant piece of evidence\n\n39:03.860 --> 39:07.120\n that will shift the probabilities in the other direction\n\n39:07.120 --> 39:10.500\n is the discovery of either a human population\n\n39:10.500 --> 39:14.280\n in which the virus circulated prior to showing up in Wuhan\n\n39:14.280 --> 39:16.920\n that would explain where the virus learned all of the tricks\n\n39:16.920 --> 39:20.340\n that it knew instantly upon spreading from Wuhan.\n\n39:20.340 --> 39:24.060\n So that would do it, or an animal population\n\n39:24.060 --> 39:27.860\n in which an ancestor epidemic can be found\n\n39:27.860 --> 39:30.600\n in which the virus learned this before jumping to humans.\n\n39:30.600 --> 39:33.460\n But I point out in that second case,\n\n39:33.460 --> 39:36.600\n you would certainly expect to see a great deal of evolution\n\n39:36.600 --> 39:39.700\n in the early epidemic, which we don't see.\n\n39:39.700 --> 39:42.860\n So there almost has to be a human population\n\n39:42.860 --> 39:44.980\n somewhere else that had the virus circulate\n\n39:44.980 --> 39:47.580\n or an ancestor of the virus that we first saw\n\n39:47.580 --> 39:48.620\n in Wuhan circulating.\n\n39:48.620 --> 39:50.940\n And it has to have gotten very sophisticated\n\n39:50.940 --> 39:54.020\n in that prior epidemic before hitting Wuhan\n\n39:54.020 --> 39:56.380\n in order to explain the total lack of evolution\n\n39:56.380 --> 40:00.120\n and extremely effective virus that emerged\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:01.660\n at the end of 2019.\n\n40:01.660 --> 40:03.680\n So you don't believe in the magic of evolution\n\n40:03.680 --> 40:05.660\n to spring up with all the tricks already there?\n\n40:05.660 --> 40:07.460\n Like everybody who doesn't have the tricks,\n\n40:07.460 --> 40:09.420\n they die quickly.\n\n40:09.420 --> 40:11.500\n And then you just have this beautiful virus\n\n40:11.500 --> 40:13.420\n that comes in with a spike protein\n\n40:13.420 --> 40:17.180\n and through mutation and selection,\n\n40:17.180 --> 40:22.180\n just like the ones that succeed and succeed big\n\n40:23.660 --> 40:25.780\n are the ones that are going to just spring into life\n\n40:25.780 --> 40:26.780\n with the tricks.\n\n40:26.780 --> 40:30.580\n Well, no, that's called a hopeful monster.\n\n40:30.580 --> 40:33.180\n And hopeful monsters don't work.\n\n40:33.180 --> 40:37.700\n The job of becoming a new pandemic virus is too difficult.\n\n40:37.700 --> 40:39.340\n It involves two very difficult steps\n\n40:39.340 --> 40:40.340\n and they both have to work.\n\n40:40.340 --> 40:43.420\n One is the ability to infect a person and spread\n\n40:43.420 --> 40:46.780\n in their tissues sufficient to make an infection.\n\n40:46.780 --> 40:49.140\n And the other is to jump between individuals\n\n40:49.140 --> 40:51.540\n at a sufficient rate that it doesn't go extinct\n\n40:51.540 --> 40:53.340\n for one reason or another.\n\n40:53.340 --> 40:55.180\n Those are both very difficult jobs.\n\n40:55.180 --> 40:58.060\n They require, as you describe, selection.\n\n40:58.060 --> 41:00.700\n And the point is selection would leave a mark.\n\n41:00.700 --> 41:02.220\n We would see evidence that it would stay.\n\n41:02.220 --> 41:04.100\n In animals or humans, we would see.\n\n41:04.100 --> 41:05.820\n Both, right?\n\n41:05.820 --> 41:09.380\n And we see this evolutionary trace of the virus\n\n41:09.380 --> 41:10.700\n gathering the tricks up.\n\n41:10.700 --> 41:12.300\n Yeah, you would see the virus,\n\n41:12.300 --> 41:14.180\n you would see the clumsy virus get better and better.\n\n41:14.180 --> 41:17.180\n And yes, I am a full believer in the power of that process.\n\n41:17.180 --> 41:18.420\n In fact, I believe it.\n\n41:19.300 --> 41:22.420\n What I know from studying the process\n\n41:22.420 --> 41:25.300\n is that it is much more powerful than most people imagine.\n\n41:25.300 --> 41:28.900\n That what we teach in the Evolution 101 textbook\n\n41:28.900 --> 41:32.100\n is too clumsy a process to do what we see it doing\n\n41:32.100 --> 41:35.220\n and that actually people should increase their expectation\n\n41:35.220 --> 41:39.780\n of the rapidity with which that process can produce\n\n41:39.780 --> 41:42.620\n just jaw dropping adaptations.\n\n41:42.620 --> 41:45.020\n That said, we just don't see evidence that it happened here\n\n41:45.020 --> 41:46.620\n which doesn't mean it doesn't exist,\n\n41:46.620 --> 41:49.340\n but it means in spite of immense pressure\n\n41:49.340 --> 41:51.980\n to find it somewhere, there's been no hint\n\n41:51.980 --> 41:55.540\n which probably means it took place inside of a laboratory.\n\n41:55.540 --> 41:58.220\n So inside the laboratory,\n\n41:58.220 --> 42:00.900\n gain of function research on viruses.\n\n42:00.900 --> 42:04.900\n And I believe most of that kind of research\n\n42:04.900 --> 42:07.100\n is doing this exact thing that you're referring to\n\n42:07.100 --> 42:09.420\n which is accelerated evolution\n\n42:09.420 --> 42:11.180\n and just watching evolution do its thing\n\n42:11.180 --> 42:12.580\n and a bunch of viruses\n\n42:12.580 --> 42:16.140\n and seeing what kind of tricks get developed.\n\n42:16.140 --> 42:21.140\n The other method is engineering viruses.\n\n42:21.340 --> 42:24.460\n So manually adding on the tricks.\n\n42:26.380 --> 42:30.940\n Which do you think we should be thinking about here?\n\n42:30.940 --> 42:33.620\n So mind you, I learned what I know\n\n42:33.620 --> 42:35.980\n in the aftermath of this pandemic emerging.\n\n42:35.980 --> 42:39.100\n I started studying the question and I would say\n\n42:39.100 --> 42:43.700\n based on the content of the genome and other evidence\n\n42:43.700 --> 42:45.660\n in publications from the various labs\n\n42:45.660 --> 42:50.380\n that were involved in generating this technology,\n\n42:50.380 --> 42:52.460\n a couple of things seem likely.\n\n42:52.460 --> 42:57.460\n This SARS CoV2 does not appear to be entirely the result\n\n42:57.740 --> 43:02.740\n of either a splicing process or serial passaging.\n\n43:02.740 --> 43:07.300\n It appears to have both things in its past\n\n43:07.300 --> 43:09.300\n or it's at least highly likely that it does.\n\n43:09.300 --> 43:11.820\n So for example, the fern cleavage site\n\n43:11.820 --> 43:15.620\n looks very much like it was added in to the virus\n\n43:15.620 --> 43:18.620\n and it was known that that would increase its infectivity\n\n43:18.620 --> 43:21.220\n in humans and increase its tropism.\n\n43:22.140 --> 43:27.140\n The virus appears to be excellent\n\n43:27.140 --> 43:32.140\n at spreading in humans and minks and ferrets.\n\n43:32.220 --> 43:34.420\n Now minks and ferrets are very closely related to each other\n\n43:34.420 --> 43:36.660\n and ferrets are very likely to have been used\n\n43:36.660 --> 43:38.580\n in a serial passage experiment.\n\n43:38.580 --> 43:41.340\n The reason being that they have an ACE2 receptor\n\n43:41.340 --> 43:43.780\n that looks very much like the human ACE2 receptor.\n\n43:43.780 --> 43:46.940\n And so were you going to passage the virus\n\n43:46.940 --> 43:49.260\n or its ancestor through an animal\n\n43:49.260 --> 43:51.620\n in order to increase its infectivity in humans,\n\n43:51.620 --> 43:53.940\n which would have been necessary,\n\n43:53.940 --> 43:55.620\n ferrets would have been very likely.\n\n43:55.620 --> 43:57.300\n It is also quite likely\n\n43:57.300 --> 44:01.420\n that humanized mice were utilized\n\n44:01.420 --> 44:05.700\n and it is possible that human airway tissue was utilized.\n\n44:05.700 --> 44:07.940\n I think it is vital that we find out\n\n44:07.940 --> 44:09.100\n what the protocols were.\n\n44:09.100 --> 44:11.380\n If this came from the Wuhan Institute,\n\n44:11.380 --> 44:12.220\n we need to know it\n\n44:12.220 --> 44:14.940\n and we need to know what the protocols were exactly\n\n44:14.940 --> 44:17.260\n because they will actually give us some tools\n\n44:17.260 --> 44:20.900\n that would be useful in fighting SARS CoV2\n\n44:20.900 --> 44:22.500\n and hopefully driving it to extinction,\n\n44:22.500 --> 44:24.420\n which ought to be our priority.\n\n44:24.420 --> 44:26.180\n It is a priority that does not,\n\n44:26.180 --> 44:28.220\n it is not apparent from our behavior,\n\n44:28.220 --> 44:31.300\n but it really is, it should be our objective.\n\n44:31.300 --> 44:33.420\n If we understood where our interests lie,\n\n44:33.420 --> 44:35.700\n we would be much more focused on it.\n\n44:36.580 --> 44:39.340\n But those protocols would tell us a great deal.\n\n44:39.340 --> 44:42.140\n If it wasn't the Wuhan Institute, we need to know that.\n\n44:42.140 --> 44:44.420\n If it was nature, we need to know that.\n\n44:44.420 --> 44:45.860\n And if it was some other laboratory,\n\n44:45.860 --> 44:48.500\n we need to figure out what and where\n\n44:48.500 --> 44:51.340\n so that we can determine what we can determine\n\n44:51.340 --> 44:53.060\n about what was done.\n\n44:53.060 --> 44:57.340\n You're opening up my mind about why we should investigate,\n\n44:57.340 --> 45:01.340\n why we should know the truth of the origins of this virus.\n\n45:01.340 --> 45:03.060\n So for me personally,\n\n45:03.060 --> 45:05.980\n let me just tell the story of my own kind of journey.\n\n45:07.420 --> 45:11.460\n When I first started looking into the lab leak hypothesis,\n\n45:12.820 --> 45:15.060\n what became terrifying to me\n\n45:15.060 --> 45:19.100\n and important to understand and obvious\n\n45:19.100 --> 45:22.300\n is the sort of like Sam Harris way of thinking,\n\n45:22.300 --> 45:27.020\n which is it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly virus\n\n45:27.020 --> 45:28.260\n will eventually happen.\n\n45:29.460 --> 45:32.580\n My mind was, it doesn't even matter\n\n45:32.580 --> 45:34.540\n if it happened in this case.\n\n45:34.540 --> 45:37.460\n It's obvious that it's going to happen in the future.\n\n45:37.460 --> 45:40.620\n So why the hell are we not freaking out about this?\n\n45:40.620 --> 45:42.540\n And COVID 19 is not even that deadly\n\n45:42.540 --> 45:45.100\n relative to the possible future viruses.\n\n45:45.100 --> 45:47.660\n It's this, the way I disagree with Sam on this,\n\n45:47.660 --> 45:50.620\n but he thinks about this way about AGI as well,\n\n45:50.620 --> 45:52.380\n not about artificial intelligence.\n\n45:52.380 --> 45:54.100\n It's a different discussion, I think,\n\n45:54.100 --> 45:56.540\n but with viruses, it seems like something that could happen\n\n45:56.540 --> 46:00.060\n on the scale of years, maybe a few decades.\n\n46:00.060 --> 46:02.380\n AGI is a little bit farther out for me,\n\n46:02.380 --> 46:04.220\n but it seemed, the terrifying thing,\n\n46:04.220 --> 46:08.460\n it seemed obvious that this will happen very soon\n\n46:08.460 --> 46:11.700\n for a much deadlier virus as we get better and better\n\n46:11.700 --> 46:13.780\n at both engineering viruses\n\n46:13.780 --> 46:16.660\n and doing this kind of evolutionary driven research,\n\n46:16.660 --> 46:18.620\n gain of function research.\n\n46:18.620 --> 46:23.100\n Okay, but then you started speaking out about this as well,\n\n46:23.100 --> 46:25.260\n but also started to say, no, no, no,\n\n46:25.260 --> 46:27.780\n we should hurry up and figure out the origins now\n\n46:27.780 --> 46:29.780\n because it will help us figure out\n\n46:29.780 --> 46:34.780\n how to actually respond to this particular virus,\n\n46:35.500 --> 46:37.660\n how to treat this particular virus.\n\n46:37.660 --> 46:40.460\n What is in terms of vaccines, in terms of antiviral drugs,\n\n46:40.460 --> 46:45.460\n in terms of just all the number of responses\n\n46:45.820 --> 46:46.660\n that we should have.\n\n46:46.660 --> 46:51.660\n Okay, I still am much more freaking out about the future.\n\n46:53.900 --> 46:57.620\n Maybe you can break that apart a little bit.\n\n46:57.620 --> 47:02.620\n Which are you most focused on now?\n\n47:03.940 --> 47:06.900\n Which are you most freaking out about now\n\n47:06.900 --> 47:08.620\n in terms of the importance of figuring out\n\n47:08.620 --> 47:10.620\n the origins of this virus?\n\n47:10.620 --> 47:13.660\n I am most freaking out about both of them\n\n47:13.660 --> 47:15.380\n because they're both really important\n\n47:15.380 --> 47:18.100\n and we can put bounds on this.\n\n47:18.100 --> 47:20.900\n Let me say first that this is a perfect test case\n\n47:20.900 --> 47:22.460\n for the theory of close calls\n\n47:22.460 --> 47:25.260\n because as much as COVID is a disaster,\n\n47:25.260 --> 47:28.500\n it is also a close call from which we can learn much.\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:29.700\n You are absolutely right.\n\n47:29.700 --> 47:32.140\n If we keep playing this game in the lab,\n\n47:32.140 --> 47:34.820\n if we are not, if we are,\n\n47:34.820 --> 47:36.540\n especially if we do it under pressure\n\n47:36.540 --> 47:37.860\n and when we are told that a virus\n\n47:37.860 --> 47:40.100\n is going to leap from nature any day\n\n47:40.100 --> 47:41.300\n and that the more we know,\n\n47:41.300 --> 47:42.540\n the better we'll be able to fight it,\n\n47:42.540 --> 47:44.620\n we're gonna create the disaster,\n\n47:44.620 --> 47:46.540\n all the sooner.\n\n47:46.540 --> 47:49.460\n So yes, that should be an absolute focus.\n\n47:49.460 --> 47:50.940\n The fact that there were people saying\n\n47:50.940 --> 47:54.420\n that this was dangerous back in 2015\n\n47:54.420 --> 47:55.460\n ought to tell us something.\n\n47:55.460 --> 47:57.780\n The fact that the system bypassed a ban\n\n47:57.780 --> 48:00.140\n and offshored the work to China\n\n48:00.140 --> 48:02.180\n ought to tell us this is not a Chinese failure.\n\n48:02.180 --> 48:05.820\n This is a failure of something larger and harder to see.\n\n48:07.020 --> 48:11.620\n But I also think that there's a clock ticking\n\n48:11.620 --> 48:14.780\n with respect to SARS CoV2 and COVID,\n\n48:14.780 --> 48:16.940\n the disease that it creates.\n\n48:16.940 --> 48:18.340\n And that has to do with whether or not\n\n48:18.340 --> 48:20.980\n we are stuck with it permanently.\n\n48:20.980 --> 48:22.980\n So if you think about the cost to humanity\n\n48:22.980 --> 48:24.940\n of being stuck with influenza,\n\n48:24.940 --> 48:27.220\n it's an immense cost year after year.\n\n48:27.220 --> 48:30.300\n And we just stop thinking about it because it's there.\n\n48:30.300 --> 48:32.460\n Some years you get the flu, most years you don't.\n\n48:32.460 --> 48:34.220\n Maybe you get the vaccine to prevent it.\n\n48:34.220 --> 48:37.180\n Maybe the vaccine isn't particularly well targeted.\n\n48:37.180 --> 48:40.260\n But imagine just simply doubling that cost.\n\n48:40.260 --> 48:44.020\n Imagine we get stuck with SARS CoV2\n\n48:44.020 --> 48:45.980\n and its descendants going forward\n\n48:45.980 --> 48:48.300\n and that it just settles in\n\n48:48.300 --> 48:51.340\n and becomes a fact of modern human life.\n\n48:51.340 --> 48:52.860\n That would be a disaster, right?\n\n48:52.860 --> 48:54.660\n The number of people we will ultimately lose\n\n48:54.660 --> 48:55.980\n is incalculable.\n\n48:55.980 --> 48:58.340\n The amount of suffering that will be caused is incalculable.\n\n48:58.340 --> 49:01.980\n The loss of wellbeing and wealth, incalculable.\n\n49:01.980 --> 49:04.660\n So that ought to be a very high priority,\n\n49:04.660 --> 49:08.100\n driving this extinct before it becomes permanent.\n\n49:08.100 --> 49:12.020\n And the ability to drive extinct goes down\n\n49:12.020 --> 49:15.660\n the longer we delay effective responses.\n\n49:15.660 --> 49:18.900\n To the extent that we let it have this very large canvas,\n\n49:18.900 --> 49:21.580\n large numbers of people who have the disease\n\n49:21.580 --> 49:25.060\n in which mutation and selection can result in adaptation\n\n49:25.060 --> 49:26.980\n that we will not be able to counter\n\n49:26.980 --> 49:29.540\n the greater its ability to figure out features\n\n49:29.540 --> 49:33.660\n of our immune system and use them to its advantage.\n\n49:33.660 --> 49:37.340\n So I'm feeling the pressure of driving it extinct.\n\n49:37.340 --> 49:40.460\n I believe we could have driven it extinct six months ago\n\n49:40.460 --> 49:43.420\n and we didn't do it because of very mundane concerns\n\n49:43.420 --> 49:44.860\n among a small number of people.\n\n49:44.860 --> 49:49.860\n And I'm not alleging that they were brazen about\n\n49:52.140 --> 49:55.220\n or that they were callous about deaths that would be caused.\n\n49:55.220 --> 49:56.660\n I have the sense that they were working\n\n49:56.660 --> 50:00.380\n from a kind of autopilot in which you,\n\n50:00.380 --> 50:02.700\n let's say you're in some kind of a corporation,\n\n50:02.700 --> 50:04.420\n a pharmaceutical corporation,\n\n50:04.420 --> 50:08.500\n you have a portfolio of therapies\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:11.540\n that in the context of a pandemic might be very lucrative.\n\n50:11.540 --> 50:13.860\n Those therapies have competitors.\n\n50:13.860 --> 50:15.780\n You of course wanna position your product\n\n50:15.780 --> 50:18.940\n so that it succeeds and the competitors don't.\n\n50:18.940 --> 50:22.220\n And lo and behold, at some point through means\n\n50:22.220 --> 50:23.820\n that I think those of us on the outside\n\n50:23.820 --> 50:28.580\n can't really intuit, you end up saying things\n\n50:28.580 --> 50:30.940\n about competing therapies that work better\n\n50:30.940 --> 50:33.940\n and much more safely than the ones you're selling\n\n50:33.940 --> 50:36.460\n that aren't true and do cause people to die\n\n50:36.460 --> 50:38.660\n in large numbers.\n\n50:38.660 --> 50:43.180\n But it's some kind of autopilot, at least part of it is.\n\n50:43.180 --> 50:47.460\n So there's a complicated coupling of the autopilot\n\n50:47.460 --> 50:52.460\n of institutions, companies, governments.\n\n50:53.540 --> 50:57.580\n And then there's also the geopolitical game theory thing\n\n50:57.580 --> 51:00.500\n going on where you wanna keep secrets.\n\n51:00.500 --> 51:03.900\n It's the Chernobyl thing where if you messed up,\n\n51:04.860 --> 51:07.780\n there's a big incentive, I think,\n\n51:07.780 --> 51:10.780\n to hide the fact that you messed up.\n\n51:10.780 --> 51:12.740\n So how do we fix this?\n\n51:12.740 --> 51:14.460\n And what's more important to fix?\n\n51:14.460 --> 51:18.420\n The autopilot, which is the response\n\n51:18.420 --> 51:21.980\n that we often criticize about our institutions,\n\n51:21.980 --> 51:23.900\n especially the leaders in those institutions,\n\n51:23.900 --> 51:25.860\n Anthony Fauci and so on,\n\n51:25.860 --> 51:29.100\n some of the members of the scientific community.\n\n51:29.100 --> 51:34.100\n And the second part is the game with China\n\n51:35.180 --> 51:37.260\n of hiding the information\n\n51:37.260 --> 51:39.460\n in terms of on the fight between nations.\n\n51:40.300 --> 51:42.860\n Well, in our live streams on Dark Horse,\n\n51:42.860 --> 51:44.860\n Heather and I have been talking from the beginning\n\n51:44.860 --> 51:47.300\n about the fact that although, yes,\n\n51:47.300 --> 51:50.020\n what happens began in China,\n\n51:50.020 --> 51:51.540\n it very much looks like a failure\n\n51:51.540 --> 51:53.820\n of the international scientific community.\n\n51:54.700 --> 51:57.700\n That's frightening, but it's also hopeful\n\n51:57.700 --> 52:01.020\n in the sense that actually if we did the right thing now,\n\n52:01.020 --> 52:05.380\n we're not navigating a puzzle about Chinese responsibility.\n\n52:05.380 --> 52:10.380\n We're navigating a question of collective responsibility\n\n52:10.380 --> 52:14.140\n for something that has been terribly costly to all of us.\n\n52:14.140 --> 52:17.980\n So that's not a very happy process.\n\n52:17.980 --> 52:20.140\n But as you point out, what's at stake\n\n52:20.140 --> 52:22.220\n is in large measure at the very least\n\n52:22.220 --> 52:24.980\n the strong possibility this will happen again\n\n52:24.980 --> 52:27.140\n and that at some point it will be far worse.\n\n52:27.140 --> 52:32.140\n So just as a person that does not learn the lessons\n\n52:32.300 --> 52:34.940\n of their own errors doesn't get smarter\n\n52:34.940 --> 52:37.220\n and they remain in danger,\n\n52:37.220 --> 52:40.020\n we collectively, humanity has to say,\n\n52:40.020 --> 52:43.060\n well, there sure is a lot of evidence\n\n52:43.060 --> 52:46.020\n that suggests that this is a self inflicted wound.\n\n52:46.020 --> 52:47.860\n When you have done something\n\n52:47.860 --> 52:51.260\n that has caused a massive self inflicted wound,\n\n52:51.260 --> 52:55.340\n self inflicted wound, it makes sense to dwell on it\n\n52:55.340 --> 52:57.660\n exactly to the point that you have learned the lesson\n\n52:57.660 --> 52:59.620\n that makes it very, very unlikely\n\n52:59.620 --> 53:01.820\n that something similar will happen again.\n\n53:01.820 --> 53:04.380\n I think this is a good place to kind of ask you\n\n53:04.380 --> 53:06.380\n to do almost like a thought experiment\n\n53:07.500 --> 53:12.500\n or to steel man the argument against the lab leak hypothesis.\n\n53:15.500 --> 53:20.500\n So if you were to argue, you said 95% chance\n\n53:20.500 --> 53:25.500\n that the virus leak from a lab.\n\n53:26.500 --> 53:29.940\n There's a bunch of ways I think you can argue\n\n53:29.940 --> 53:34.940\n that even talking about it is bad for the world.\n\n53:37.020 --> 53:40.140\n So if I just put something on the table,\n\n53:40.140 --> 53:44.060\n it's to say that for one,\n\n53:44.060 --> 53:46.780\n it would be racism versus Chinese people\n\n53:46.780 --> 53:51.220\n that talking about that it leaked from a lab,\n\n53:51.220 --> 53:53.620\n there's a kind of immediate kind of blame\n\n53:53.620 --> 53:56.300\n and it can spiral down into this idea\n\n53:56.300 --> 54:00.020\n that's somehow the people are responsible for the virus\n\n54:00.020 --> 54:02.100\n and this kind of thing.\n\n54:02.100 --> 54:03.340\n Is it possible for you to come up\n\n54:03.340 --> 54:08.340\n with other steel man arguments against talking\n\n54:08.860 --> 54:12.160\n or against the possibility of the lab leak hypothesis?\n\n54:12.160 --> 54:16.760\n Well, so I think steel manning is a tool\n\n54:16.760 --> 54:19.240\n that is extremely valuable,\n\n54:19.240 --> 54:22.800\n but it's also possible to abuse it.\n\n54:22.800 --> 54:26.440\n I think that you can only steel man a good faith argument.\n\n54:26.440 --> 54:28.600\n And the problem is we now know\n\n54:28.600 --> 54:31.280\n that we have not been engaged in opponents\n\n54:31.280 --> 54:32.720\n who were wielding good faith arguments\n\n54:32.720 --> 54:36.240\n because privately their emails reflect their own doubts.\n\n54:36.240 --> 54:39.880\n And what they were doing publicly was actually a punishment,\n\n54:39.880 --> 54:43.200\n a public punishment for those of us who spoke up\n\n54:43.200 --> 54:46.960\n with I think the purpose of either backing us down\n\n54:46.960 --> 54:49.120\n or more likely warning others\n\n54:49.120 --> 54:51.280\n not to engage in the same kind of behavior.\n\n54:51.280 --> 54:53.420\n And obviously for people like you and me\n\n54:53.420 --> 54:58.420\n who regard science as our likely best hope\n\n54:58.600 --> 55:01.440\n for navigating difficult waters,\n\n55:01.440 --> 55:05.200\n shutting down people who are using those tools honorably\n\n55:05.200 --> 55:07.540\n is itself dishonorable.\n\n55:07.540 --> 55:12.540\n So I don't feel that there's anything to steel man.\n\n55:13.840 --> 55:17.900\n And I also think that immediately at the point\n\n55:17.900 --> 55:21.400\n that the world suddenly with no new evidence on the table\n\n55:21.400 --> 55:24.160\n switched gears with respect to the lab leak,\n\n55:24.160 --> 55:26.500\n at the point that Nicholas Wade had published his article\n\n55:26.500 --> 55:28.480\n and suddenly the world was going to admit\n\n55:28.480 --> 55:32.860\n that this was at least a possibility, if not a likelihood,\n\n55:32.860 --> 55:36.560\n we got to see something of the rationalization process\n\n55:36.560 --> 55:39.320\n that had taken place inside the institutional world.\n\n55:39.320 --> 55:41.760\n And it very definitely involved the claim\n\n55:41.760 --> 55:45.080\n that what was being avoided was the targeting\n\n55:45.080 --> 55:49.080\n of Chinese scientists.\n\n55:49.080 --> 55:50.040\n And my point would be,\n\n55:50.040 --> 55:53.420\n I don't wanna see the targeting of anyone.\n\n55:53.420 --> 55:55.880\n I don't want to see racism of any kind.\n\n55:55.880 --> 56:00.700\n On the other hand, once you create license to lie\n\n56:00.700 --> 56:05.700\n in order to protect individuals when the world has a stake\n\n56:05.700 --> 56:08.620\n in knowing what happened, then it is inevitable\n\n56:08.620 --> 56:12.300\n that that process, that license to lie will be used\n\n56:12.300 --> 56:14.100\n by the thing that captures institutions\n\n56:14.100 --> 56:15.220\n for its own purposes.\n\n56:15.220 --> 56:19.540\n So my sense is it may be very unfortunate\n\n56:19.540 --> 56:22.100\n if the story of what happened here\n\n56:22.100 --> 56:26.660\n can be used against Chinese people.\n\n56:26.660 --> 56:27.980\n That would be very unfortunate.\n\n56:27.980 --> 56:30.980\n And as I think I mentioned,\n\n56:30.980 --> 56:33.740\n Heather and I have taken great pains to point out\n\n56:33.740 --> 56:35.820\n that this doesn't look like a Chinese failure.\n\n56:35.820 --> 56:36.640\n It looks like a failure\n\n56:36.640 --> 56:38.420\n of the international scientific community.\n\n56:38.420 --> 56:41.140\n So I think it is important to broadcast that message\n\n56:41.140 --> 56:43.920\n along with the analysis of the evidence.\n\n56:43.920 --> 56:46.780\n But no matter what happened, we have a right to know.\n\n56:46.780 --> 56:50.860\n And I frankly do not take the institutional layer\n\n56:50.860 --> 56:53.500\n at its word that its motivations are honorable\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:56.720\n and that it was protecting good hearted scientists\n\n56:56.720 --> 56:58.100\n at the expense of the world.\n\n56:58.100 --> 57:00.300\n That explanation does not add up.\n\n57:00.300 --> 57:04.260\n Well, this is a very interesting question about\n\n57:04.260 --> 57:08.300\n whether it's ever okay to lie at the institutional layer\n\n57:08.300 --> 57:11.180\n to protect the populace.\n\n57:12.940 --> 57:16.260\n I think both you and I are probably on the same,\n\n57:18.380 --> 57:21.900\n have the same sense that it's a slippery slope.\n\n57:21.900 --> 57:25.220\n Even if it's an effective mechanism in the short term,\n\n57:25.220 --> 57:27.700\n in the long term, it's going to be destructive.\n\n57:27.700 --> 57:30.940\n This happened with masks.\n\n57:30.940 --> 57:32.540\n This happened with other things.\n\n57:32.540 --> 57:34.620\n If you look at just history pandemics,\n\n57:35.420 --> 57:40.420\n there's an idea that panic is destructive\n\n57:40.420 --> 57:41.300\n amongst the populace.\n\n57:41.300 --> 57:44.440\n So you want to construct a narrative,\n\n57:44.440 --> 57:48.520\n whether it's a lie or not to minimize panic.\n\n57:49.540 --> 57:52.760\n But you're suggesting that almost in all cases,\n\n57:52.760 --> 57:57.560\n and I think that was the lesson from the pandemic\n\n57:57.560 --> 57:59.260\n in the early 20th century,\n\n57:59.260 --> 58:03.660\n that lying creates distrust\n\n58:03.660 --> 58:08.220\n and distrust in the institutions is ultimately destructive.\n\n58:08.220 --> 58:10.820\n That's your sense that lying is not okay?\n\n58:10.820 --> 58:12.380\n Well, okay.\n\n58:12.380 --> 58:15.800\n There are obviously places where complete transparency\n\n58:15.800 --> 58:17.300\n is not a good idea, right?\n\n58:17.300 --> 58:19.980\n To the extent that you broadcast a technology\n\n58:19.980 --> 58:24.220\n that allows one individual to hold the world hostage,\n\n58:24.220 --> 58:27.660\n obviously you've got something to be navigated.\n\n58:27.660 --> 58:32.660\n But in general, I don't believe that the scientific system\n\n58:32.900 --> 58:36.100\n should be lying to us.\n\n58:36.100 --> 58:39.820\n In the case of this particular lie,\n\n58:39.820 --> 58:44.820\n the idea that the wellbeing of Chinese scientists\n\n58:45.380 --> 58:50.220\n outweighs the wellbeing of the world is preposterous.\n\n58:50.220 --> 58:51.900\n Right, as you point out,\n\n58:51.900 --> 58:53.460\n one thing that rests on this question\n\n58:53.460 --> 58:55.980\n is whether we continue to do this kind of research\n\n58:55.980 --> 58:56.820\n going forward.\n\n58:56.820 --> 58:58.940\n And the scientists in question, all of them,\n\n58:58.940 --> 59:03.300\n American, Chinese, all of them were pushing the idea\n\n59:03.300 --> 59:06.140\n that the risk of a zoonotic spillover event\n\n59:06.140 --> 59:08.860\n causing a major and highly destructive pandemic\n\n59:08.860 --> 59:12.260\n was so great that we had to risk this.\n\n59:12.260 --> 59:14.420\n Now, if they themselves have caused it,\n\n59:14.420 --> 59:16.780\n and if they are wrong, as I believe they are,\n\n59:16.780 --> 59:19.260\n about the likelihood of a major world pandemic\n\n59:19.260 --> 59:20.780\n spilling out of nature\n\n59:20.780 --> 59:24.660\n in the way that they wrote into their grant applications,\n\n59:24.660 --> 59:28.020\n then the danger is the call is coming from inside the house\n\n59:28.020 --> 59:31.240\n and we have to look at that.\n\n59:31.240 --> 59:33.860\n And yes, whatever we have to do\n\n59:33.860 --> 59:38.300\n to protect scientists from retribution, we should do,\n\n59:38.300 --> 59:42.900\n but we cannot protecting them by lying to the world.\n\n59:42.900 --> 59:45.180\n And even worse,\n\n59:45.180 --> 59:50.180\n by demonizing people like me, like Josh Rogin,\n\n59:54.060 --> 59:58.980\n like Yuri Dagan, the entire drastic group on Twitter,\n\n59:58.980 --> 1:00:02.980\n by demonizing us for simply following the evidence\n\n1:00:02.980 --> 1:00:05.740\n is to set a terrible precedent, right?\n\n1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:08.420\n You're demonizing people for using the scientific method\n\n1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:11.980\n to evaluate evidence that is available to us in the world.\n\n1:00:11.980 --> 1:00:16.020\n What a terrible crime it is to teach that lesson, right?\n\n1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:18.060\n Thou shalt not use scientific tools.\n\n1:00:18.060 --> 1:00:19.300\n No, I'm sorry.\n\n1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:22.540\n Whatever your license to lie is, it doesn't extend to that.\n\n1:00:22.540 --> 1:00:25.420\n Yeah, I've seen the attacks on you,\n\n1:00:25.420 --> 1:00:28.500\n the pressure on you has a very important effect\n\n1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:34.540\n on thousands of world class biologists actually.\n\n1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:40.020\n At MIT, colleagues of mine, people I know,\n\n1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:44.140\n there's a slight pressure to not be allowed\n\n1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:49.140\n to one, speak publicly and two, actually think.\n\n1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:53.620\n Like do you even think about these ideas?\n\n1:00:53.620 --> 1:00:55.020\n It sounds kind of ridiculous,\n\n1:00:55.020 --> 1:00:58.720\n but just in the privacy of your own home,\n\n1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:03.100\n to read things, to think, it's many people,\n\n1:01:03.100 --> 1:01:06.940\n many world class biologists that I know\n\n1:01:06.940 --> 1:01:10.740\n will just avoid looking at the data.\n\n1:01:10.740 --> 1:01:12.180\n There's not even that many people\n\n1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:15.340\n that are publicly opposing gain of function research.\n\n1:01:15.340 --> 1:01:18.860\n They're also like, it's not worth it.\n\n1:01:18.860 --> 1:01:20.140\n It's not worth the battle.\n\n1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:21.720\n And there's many people that kind of argue\n\n1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:24.800\n that those battles should be fought in private,\n\n1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:31.300\n with colleagues in the privacy of the scientific community\n\n1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:35.500\n that the public is somehow not maybe intelligent enough\n\n1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:38.300\n to be able to deal with the complexities\n\n1:01:38.300 --> 1:01:39.780\n of this kind of discussion.\n\n1:01:39.780 --> 1:01:41.420\n I don't know, but the final result\n\n1:01:41.420 --> 1:01:44.100\n is combined with the bullying of you\n\n1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:47.100\n and all the different pressures\n\n1:01:47.100 --> 1:01:49.060\n in the academic institutions is that\n\n1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:51.260\n it's just people are self censoring\n\n1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:53.420\n and silencing themselves\n\n1:01:53.420 --> 1:01:55.220\n and silencing the most important thing,\n\n1:01:55.220 --> 1:01:57.120\n which is the power of their brains.\n\n1:01:58.260 --> 1:02:01.560\n Like these people are brilliant.\n\n1:02:01.560 --> 1:02:04.540\n And the fact that they're not utilizing their brain\n\n1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:06.740\n to come up with solutions\n\n1:02:06.740 --> 1:02:11.520\n outside of the conformist line of thinking is tragic.\n\n1:02:11.520 --> 1:02:12.580\n Well, it is.\n\n1:02:12.580 --> 1:02:15.900\n I also think that we have to look at it\n\n1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:17.780\n and understand it for what it is.\n\n1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:20.900\n For one thing, it's kind of a cryptic totalitarianism.\n\n1:02:20.900 --> 1:02:23.540\n Somehow people's sense of what they're allowed\n\n1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:25.780\n to think about, talk about, discuss\n\n1:02:25.780 --> 1:02:27.380\n is causing them to self censor.\n\n1:02:27.380 --> 1:02:30.380\n And I can tell you it's causing many of them to rationalize,\n\n1:02:30.380 --> 1:02:31.280\n which is even worse.\n\n1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.660\n They're blinding themselves to what they can see.\n\n1:02:34.660 --> 1:02:36.880\n But it is also the case, I believe,\n\n1:02:37.900 --> 1:02:40.180\n that what you're describing about what people said,\n\n1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:43.060\n and a great many people understood\n\n1:02:43.060 --> 1:02:45.060\n that the lab leak hypothesis\n\n1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:47.060\n could not be taken off the table,\n\n1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:48.900\n but they didn't say so publicly.\n\n1:02:48.900 --> 1:02:52.800\n And I think that their discussions with each other\n\n1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.700\n about why they did not say what they understood,\n\n1:02:55.700 --> 1:02:59.180\n that's what capture sounds like on the inside.\n\n1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:02.940\n I don't know exactly what force captured the institutions.\n\n1:03:02.940 --> 1:03:07.940\n I don't think anybody knows for sure out here in public.\n\n1:03:07.980 --> 1:03:10.060\n I don't even know that it wasn't just simply a process.\n\n1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:13.660\n But you have these institutions.\n\n1:03:13.660 --> 1:03:18.660\n They are behaving towards a kind of somatic obligation.\n\n1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.820\n They have lost sight of what they were built to accomplish.\n\n1:03:22.820 --> 1:03:26.180\n And on the inside, the way they avoid\n\n1:03:26.180 --> 1:03:28.460\n going back to their original mission\n\n1:03:28.460 --> 1:03:30.140\n is to say things to themselves,\n\n1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:32.620\n like the public can't have this discussion.\n\n1:03:32.620 --> 1:03:34.220\n It can't be trusted with it.\n\n1:03:34.220 --> 1:03:35.780\n Yes, we need to be able to talk about this,\n\n1:03:35.780 --> 1:03:36.780\n but it has to be private.\n\n1:03:36.780 --> 1:03:38.140\n Whatever it is they say to themselves,\n\n1:03:38.140 --> 1:03:40.300\n that is what capture sounds like on the inside.\n\n1:03:40.300 --> 1:03:44.460\n It's a institutional rationalization mechanism.\n\n1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:46.460\n And it's very, very deadly.\n\n1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:50.620\n And at the point you go from lab leak to repurposed drugs,\n\n1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:54.700\n you can see that it's very deadly in a very direct way.\n\n1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:59.500\n Yeah, I see this in my field with things\n\n1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:01.740\n like autonomous weapon systems.\n\n1:04:01.740 --> 1:04:04.500\n People in AI do not talk about the use of AI\n\n1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:05.900\n in weapon systems.\n\n1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:08.700\n They kind of avoid the idea that AI's use them\n\n1:04:08.700 --> 1:04:09.820\n in the military.\n\n1:04:09.820 --> 1:04:13.100\n It's kind of funny, there's this like kind of discomfort\n\n1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:14.460\n and they're like, they all hurry,\n\n1:04:14.460 --> 1:04:17.900\n like something scary happens and a bunch of sheep\n\n1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:19.300\n kind of like run away.\n\n1:04:19.300 --> 1:04:21.340\n That's what it looks like.\n\n1:04:21.340 --> 1:04:23.660\n And I don't even know what to do about it.\n\n1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:26.460\n And then I feel this natural pull\n\n1:04:26.460 --> 1:04:29.260\n every time I bring up autonomous weapon systems\n\n1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:30.740\n to go along with the sheep.\n\n1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:33.660\n There's a natural kind of pull towards that direction\n\n1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:36.260\n because it's like, what can I do as one person?\n\n1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:40.260\n Now there's currently nothing destructive happening\n\n1:04:40.260 --> 1:04:42.060\n with autonomous weapon systems.\n\n1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:44.980\n So we're in like in the early days of this race\n\n1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:48.180\n that in 10, 20 years might become a real problem.\n\n1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.500\n Now where the discussion we're having now,\n\n1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:55.420\n we're now facing the result of that in the space of viruses,\n\n1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:58.780\n like for many years avoiding the conversations here.\n\n1:05:00.500 --> 1:05:03.580\n I don't know what to do that in the early days,\n\n1:05:03.580 --> 1:05:05.980\n but I think we have to, I guess, create institutions\n\n1:05:05.980 --> 1:05:08.300\n where people can stand out.\n\n1:05:08.300 --> 1:05:12.100\n People can stand out and like basically be individual\n\n1:05:12.100 --> 1:05:16.580\n thinkers and break out into all kinds of spaces of ideas\n\n1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:19.620\n that allow us to think freely, freedom of thought.\n\n1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:22.900\n And maybe that requires a decentralization of institutions.\n\n1:05:22.900 --> 1:05:26.060\n Well, years ago, I came up with a concept\n\n1:05:26.060 --> 1:05:28.820\n called cultivated insecurity.\n\n1:05:28.820 --> 1:05:31.700\n And the idea is, let's just take the example\n\n1:05:31.700 --> 1:05:34.140\n of the average Joe, right?\n\n1:05:34.140 --> 1:05:37.660\n The average Joe has a job somewhere\n\n1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:42.300\n and their mortgage, their medical insurance,\n\n1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:46.940\n their retirement, their connection with the economy\n\n1:05:46.940 --> 1:05:49.660\n is to one degree or another dependent\n\n1:05:49.660 --> 1:05:52.620\n on their relationship with the employer.\n\n1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:57.420\n That means that there is a strong incentive,\n\n1:05:57.420 --> 1:06:00.780\n especially in any industry where it's not easy to move\n\n1:06:00.780 --> 1:06:02.100\n from one employer to the next.\n\n1:06:02.100 --> 1:06:05.140\n There's a strong incentive to stay\n\n1:06:05.140 --> 1:06:07.100\n in your employer's good graces, right?\n\n1:06:07.100 --> 1:06:09.260\n So it creates a very top down dynamic,\n\n1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:13.740\n not only in terms of who gets to tell other people\n\n1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:16.220\n what to do, but it really comes down to\n\n1:06:16.220 --> 1:06:18.860\n who gets to tell other people how to think.\n\n1:06:18.860 --> 1:06:21.260\n So that's extremely dangerous.\n\n1:06:21.260 --> 1:06:25.540\n The way out of it is to cultivate security\n\n1:06:25.540 --> 1:06:28.380\n to the extent that somebody is in a position\n\n1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:32.500\n to go against the grain and have it not be a catastrophe\n\n1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:34.980\n for their family and their ability to earn,\n\n1:06:34.980 --> 1:06:36.620\n you will see that behavior a lot more.\n\n1:06:36.620 --> 1:06:38.780\n So I would argue that some of what you're talking about\n\n1:06:38.780 --> 1:06:41.980\n is just a simple predictable consequence\n\n1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:46.980\n of the concentration of the sources of wellbeing\n\n1:06:48.100 --> 1:06:50.540\n and that this is a solvable problem.\n\n1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:55.340\n You got a chance to talk with Joe Rogan yesterday.\n\n1:06:55.340 --> 1:06:56.540\n Yes, I did.\n\n1:06:56.540 --> 1:06:59.300\n And I just saw the episode was released\n\n1:06:59.300 --> 1:07:03.180\n and Ivermectin is trending on Twitter.\n\n1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:06.020\n Joe told me it was an incredible conversation.\n\n1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:07.380\n I look forward to listening to it today.\n\n1:07:07.380 --> 1:07:10.660\n Many people have probably, by the time this is released,\n\n1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:12.060\n have already listened to it.\n\n1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:18.100\n I think it would be interesting to discuss a postmortem.\n\n1:07:18.540 --> 1:07:21.060\n How do you feel how that conversation went?\n\n1:07:21.060 --> 1:07:25.580\n And maybe broadly, how do you see the story\n\n1:07:25.580 --> 1:07:30.420\n as it's unfolding of Ivermectin from the origins\n\n1:07:30.420 --> 1:07:34.980\n from before COVID 19 through 2020 to today?\n\n1:07:34.980 --> 1:07:36.820\n I very much enjoyed talking to Joe\n\n1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:41.380\n and I'm undescribably grateful\n\n1:07:41.380 --> 1:07:44.380\n that he would take the risk of such a discussion,\n\n1:07:44.380 --> 1:07:46.460\n that he would, as he described it,\n\n1:07:46.460 --> 1:07:49.420\n do an emergency podcast on the subject,\n\n1:07:49.420 --> 1:07:52.060\n which I think that was not an exaggeration.\n\n1:07:52.060 --> 1:07:55.420\n This needed to happen for various reasons\n\n1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:59.780\n that he took us down the road of talking about\n\n1:07:59.780 --> 1:08:01.940\n the censorship campaign against Ivermectin,\n\n1:08:01.940 --> 1:08:04.860\n which I find utterly shocking\n\n1:08:04.860 --> 1:08:07.180\n and talking about the drug itself.\n\n1:08:07.180 --> 1:08:10.900\n And I should say we talked, we had Pierre Corey available.\n\n1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:12.780\n He came on the podcast as well.\n\n1:08:12.780 --> 1:08:17.100\n He is, of course, the face of the FLCCC,\n\n1:08:17.100 --> 1:08:20.500\n the Frontline COVID 19 Critical Care Alliance.\n\n1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:23.780\n These are doctors who have innovated ways\n\n1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:26.780\n of treating COVID patients and they happened on Ivermectin\n\n1:08:26.780 --> 1:08:29.580\n and have been using it.\n\n1:08:29.580 --> 1:08:32.980\n And I hesitate to use the word advocating for it\n\n1:08:32.980 --> 1:08:36.180\n because that's not really the role of doctors or scientists,\n\n1:08:36.180 --> 1:08:38.300\n but they are advocating for it in the sense\n\n1:08:38.300 --> 1:08:41.620\n that there is this pressure not to talk about\n\n1:08:41.620 --> 1:08:44.900\n its effectiveness for reasons that we can go into.\n\n1:08:44.900 --> 1:08:48.660\n So maybe step back and say, what is Ivermectin\n\n1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:52.060\n and how much studies have been done\n\n1:08:52.060 --> 1:08:53.540\n to show its effectiveness?\n\n1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:56.460\n So Ivermectin is an interesting drug.\n\n1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:58.940\n It was discovered in the 70s\n\n1:08:58.940 --> 1:09:03.380\n by a Japanese scientist named Satoshi Omura\n\n1:09:03.380 --> 1:09:08.180\n and he found it in soil near a Japanese golf course.\n\n1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:10.500\n So I would just point out in passing\n\n1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:12.980\n that if we were to stop self silencing\n\n1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:17.300\n over the possibility that Asians will be demonized\n\n1:09:17.300 --> 1:09:20.020\n over the possible lab leak in Wuhan\n\n1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:22.620\n and to recognize that actually the natural course\n\n1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:27.620\n of the story has a likely lab leak in China,\n\n1:09:27.620 --> 1:09:31.900\n it has a unlikely hero in Japan,\n\n1:09:32.780 --> 1:09:36.820\n the story is naturally not a simple one.\n\n1:09:36.820 --> 1:09:40.900\n But in any case, Omura discovered this molecule.\n\n1:09:40.900 --> 1:09:45.540\n He sent it to a friend who was at Merck,\n\n1:09:45.540 --> 1:09:46.860\n scientist named Campbell.\n\n1:09:46.860 --> 1:09:50.460\n They won a Nobel Prize for the discovery\n\n1:09:50.460 --> 1:09:54.980\n of the Ivermectin molecule in 2015.\n\n1:09:54.980 --> 1:09:58.580\n Its initial use was in treating parasitic infections.\n\n1:09:58.580 --> 1:10:02.460\n It's very effective in treating the worm\n\n1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:04.900\n that causes river blindness,\n\n1:10:04.900 --> 1:10:08.700\n the pathogen that causes elephantitis, scabies.\n\n1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:10.860\n It's a very effective anti parasite drug.\n\n1:10:10.860 --> 1:10:11.980\n It's extremely safe.\n\n1:10:11.980 --> 1:10:14.620\n It's on the WHO's list of essential medications.\n\n1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:16.860\n It's safe for children.\n\n1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:20.100\n It has been administered something like 4 billion times\n\n1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:22.260\n in the last four decades.\n\n1:10:22.260 --> 1:10:25.420\n It has been given away in the millions of doses\n\n1:10:25.420 --> 1:10:27.780\n by Merck in Africa.\n\n1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:30.740\n People have been on it for long periods of time.\n\n1:10:30.740 --> 1:10:32.500\n And in fact, one of the reasons\n\n1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:36.700\n that Africa may have had less severe impacts from COVID 19\n\n1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:40.740\n is that Ivermectin is widely used there to prevent parasites\n\n1:10:40.740 --> 1:10:43.140\n and the drug appears to have a long lasting impact.\n\n1:10:43.140 --> 1:10:45.500\n So it's an interesting molecule.\n\n1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:49.340\n It was discovered some time ago apparently\n\n1:10:49.340 --> 1:10:50.940\n that it has antiviral properties.\n\n1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:54.660\n And so it was tested early in the COVID 19 pandemic\n\n1:10:54.660 --> 1:10:58.540\n to see if it might work to treat humans with COVID.\n\n1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:02.060\n It turned out to have very promising evidence\n\n1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:03.420\n that it did treat humans.\n\n1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:04.940\n It was tested in tissues.\n\n1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:08.700\n It was tested at a very high dosage, which confuses people.\n\n1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:10.860\n They think that those of us who believe\n\n1:11:10.860 --> 1:11:14.620\n that Ivermectin might be useful in confronting this disease\n\n1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:17.380\n are advocating those high doses, which is not the case.\n\n1:11:17.380 --> 1:11:20.580\n But in any case, there have been quite a number of studies.\n\n1:11:20.580 --> 1:11:23.780\n A wonderful meta analysis was finally released.\n\n1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.420\n We had seen it in preprint version,\n\n1:11:25.420 --> 1:11:29.580\n but it was finally peer reviewed and published this last week.\n\n1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:34.060\n It reveals that the drug, as clinicians have been telling us,\n\n1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:35.060\n those who have been using it,\n\n1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:37.620\n it's highly effective at treating people with the disease,\n\n1:11:37.620 --> 1:11:39.420\n especially if you get to them early.\n\n1:11:39.420 --> 1:11:43.300\n And it showed an 86% effectiveness as a prophylactic\n\n1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:46.300\n to prevent people from contracting COVID.\n\n1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:49.780\n And that number, 86%, is high enough\n\n1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:54.780\n to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction if we wished to deploy it.\n\n1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:58.340\n First of all, the meta analysis,\n\n1:11:58.340 --> 1:12:01.540\n is this the Ivermectin for COVID 19\n\n1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:04.300\n real time meta analysis of 60 studies?\n\n1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:06.300\n Or there's a bunch of meta analysis there.\n\n1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:09.180\n Because I was really impressed by the real time meta analysis\n\n1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:11.340\n that keeps getting updated.\n\n1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:12.420\n I don't know if it's the same kind of thing.\n\n1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:17.420\n The one at ivmmeta.com?\n\n1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:21.780\n Well, I saw it at c19ivermeta.com.\n\n1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:24.020\n No, this is not that meta analysis.\n\n1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:26.140\n So that is, as you say, a living meta analysis\n\n1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:27.780\n where you can watch as evidence rolls in.\n\n1:12:27.780 --> 1:12:29.100\n Which is super cool, by the way.\n\n1:12:29.100 --> 1:12:29.940\n It's really cool.\n\n1:12:29.940 --> 1:12:32.220\n And they've got some really nice graphics\n\n1:12:32.220 --> 1:12:35.100\n that allow you to understand, well, what is the evidence?\n\n1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:37.620\n It's concentrated around this level of effectiveness,\n\n1:12:37.620 --> 1:12:38.460\n et cetera.\n\n1:12:38.460 --> 1:12:40.900\n So anyway, it's a great site, well worth paying attention to.\n\n1:12:40.900 --> 1:12:43.540\n No, this is a meta analysis.\n\n1:12:43.540 --> 1:12:46.380\n I don't know any of the authors but one.\n\n1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:49.380\n Second author is Tess Lorry of the BIRD group.\n\n1:12:49.380 --> 1:12:54.380\n BIRD being a group of analysts and doctors in Britain\n\n1:12:55.620 --> 1:12:59.580\n that is playing a role similar to the FLCCC here in the US.\n\n1:13:00.540 --> 1:13:02.020\n So anyway, this is a meta analysis\n\n1:13:02.020 --> 1:13:06.220\n that Tess Lorry and others did\n\n1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.100\n of all of the available evidence.\n\n1:13:08.100 --> 1:13:10.700\n And it's quite compelling.\n\n1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:12.820\n People can look for it on my Twitter.\n\n1:13:12.820 --> 1:13:15.100\n I will put it up and people can find it there.\n\n1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.380\n So what about dose here?\n\n1:13:18.860 --> 1:13:22.260\n In terms of safety, what do we understand\n\n1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:23.780\n about the kind of dose required\n\n1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:26.820\n to have that level of effectiveness?\n\n1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:29.140\n And what do we understand about the safety\n\n1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:30.180\n of that kind of dose?\n\n1:13:30.180 --> 1:13:32.540\n So let me just say, I'm not a medical doctor.\n\n1:13:32.540 --> 1:13:34.420\n I'm a biologist.\n\n1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:39.180\n I'm on ivermectin in lieu of vaccination.\n\n1:13:39.180 --> 1:13:42.500\n In terms of dosage, there is one reason for concern,\n\n1:13:42.500 --> 1:13:45.740\n which is that the most effective dose for prophylaxis\n\n1:13:45.740 --> 1:13:49.460\n involves something like weekly administration.\n\n1:13:49.460 --> 1:13:53.660\n And because that is not a historical pattern of use\n\n1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:56.380\n for the drug, it is possible\n\n1:13:56.380 --> 1:13:58.020\n that there is some longterm implication\n\n1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:02.460\n of being on it weekly for a long period of time.\n\n1:14:02.460 --> 1:14:04.100\n There's not a strong indication of that.\n\n1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:07.660\n The safety signal that we have over people using the drug\n\n1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:10.020\n over many years and using it in high doses.\n\n1:14:10.020 --> 1:14:12.300\n In fact, Dr. Corey told me yesterday\n\n1:14:13.500 --> 1:14:15.340\n that there are cases in which people\n\n1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:17.660\n have made calculation errors\n\n1:14:17.660 --> 1:14:19.820\n and taken a massive overdose of the drug\n\n1:14:19.820 --> 1:14:21.420\n and had no ill effect.\n\n1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:23.300\n So anyway, there's lots of reasons\n\n1:14:23.300 --> 1:14:24.860\n to think the drug is comparatively safe,\n\n1:14:24.860 --> 1:14:27.060\n but no drug is perfectly safe.\n\n1:14:27.060 --> 1:14:29.700\n And I do worry about the longterm implications\n\n1:14:29.700 --> 1:14:30.740\n of taking it.\n\n1:14:30.740 --> 1:14:32.580\n I also think it's very likely\n\n1:14:32.580 --> 1:14:37.580\n that because the drug is administered\n\n1:14:37.900 --> 1:14:42.220\n in a dose something like, let's say 15 milligrams\n\n1:14:42.220 --> 1:14:44.860\n for somebody my size once a week\n\n1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:48.540\n after you've gone through the initial double dose\n\n1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:50.380\n that you take 48 hours apart,\n\n1:14:51.340 --> 1:14:55.340\n it is apparent that if the amount of drug in your system\n\n1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:58.300\n is sufficient to be protective at the end of the week,\n\n1:14:58.300 --> 1:15:00.140\n then it was probably far too high\n\n1:15:00.140 --> 1:15:01.300\n at the beginning of the week.\n\n1:15:01.300 --> 1:15:03.340\n So there's a question about whether or not\n\n1:15:03.340 --> 1:15:05.940\n you could flatten out the intake\n\n1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:09.780\n so that the amount of ivermectin goes down,\n\n1:15:09.780 --> 1:15:10.940\n but the protection remains.\n\n1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.180\n I have little doubt that that would be discovered\n\n1:15:13.180 --> 1:15:14.180\n if we looked for it.\n\n1:15:15.180 --> 1:15:18.900\n But that said, it does seem to be quite safe,\n\n1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:21.020\n highly effective at preventing COVID.\n\n1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:23.980\n The 86% number is plenty high enough\n\n1:15:23.980 --> 1:15:27.700\n for us to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction\n\n1:15:27.700 --> 1:15:31.420\n in light of its R0 number of slightly more than two.\n\n1:15:33.140 --> 1:15:36.660\n And so why we are not using it is a bit of a mystery.\n\n1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:39.140\n So even if everything you said now\n\n1:15:39.140 --> 1:15:40.940\n turns out to be not correct,\n\n1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:46.860\n it is nevertheless obvious that it's sufficiently promising\n\n1:15:46.860 --> 1:15:50.500\n and it always has been in order to merit rigorous\n\n1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.340\n scientific exploration, investigation,\n\n1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:57.860\n doing a lot of studies and certainly not censoring\n\n1:15:57.860 --> 1:16:00.260\n the science or the discussion of it.\n\n1:16:00.260 --> 1:16:05.260\n So before we talk about the various vaccines for COVID 19,\n\n1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:08.180\n I'd like to talk to you about censorship.\n\n1:16:08.180 --> 1:16:10.100\n Given everything you're saying,\n\n1:16:10.100 --> 1:16:14.740\n why did YouTube and other places\n\n1:16:14.740 --> 1:16:19.740\n censor discussion of ivermectin?\n\n1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:21.940\n Well, there's a question about why they say they did it\n\n1:16:21.940 --> 1:16:24.620\n and there's a question about why they actually did it.\n\n1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:27.260\n Now, it is worth mentioning\n\n1:16:27.260 --> 1:16:30.660\n that YouTube is part of a consortium.\n\n1:16:31.540 --> 1:16:36.540\n It is partnered with Twitter, Facebook, Reuters, AP,\n\n1:16:36.980 --> 1:16:40.180\n Financial Times, Washington Post,\n\n1:16:40.180 --> 1:16:42.780\n some other notable organizations.\n\n1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:46.780\n And that this group has appointed itself\n\n1:16:46.780 --> 1:16:48.620\n the arbiter of truth.\n\n1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:53.140\n In effect, they have decided to control discussion\n\n1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:56.660\n ostensibly to prevent the distribution of misinformation.\n\n1:16:57.620 --> 1:16:59.220\n Now, how have they chosen to do that?\n\n1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:03.420\n In this case, they have chosen to simply utilize\n\n1:17:03.420 --> 1:17:06.780\n the recommendations of the WHO and the CDC\n\n1:17:06.780 --> 1:17:09.020\n and apply them as if they are synonymous\n\n1:17:09.020 --> 1:17:10.100\n with scientific truth.\n\n1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:14.260\n Problem, even at their best,\n\n1:17:14.260 --> 1:17:17.340\n the WHO and CDC are not scientific entities.\n\n1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:20.900\n They are entities that are about public health.\n\n1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:24.700\n And public health has this, whether it's right or not,\n\n1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:26.780\n and I believe I disagree with it,\n\n1:17:26.780 --> 1:17:31.780\n but it has this self assigned right to lie\n\n1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:36.740\n that comes from the fact that there is game theory\n\n1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:38.580\n that works against, for example,\n\n1:17:38.580 --> 1:17:40.580\n a successful vaccination campaign.\n\n1:17:40.580 --> 1:17:44.660\n That if everybody else takes a vaccine\n\n1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:48.260\n and therefore the herd becomes immune through vaccination\n\n1:17:48.260 --> 1:17:50.540\n and you decide not to take a vaccine,\n\n1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:52.980\n then you benefit from the immunity of the herd\n\n1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:55.060\n without having taken the risk.\n\n1:17:55.060 --> 1:17:58.620\n So people who do best are the people who opt out.\n\n1:17:58.620 --> 1:17:59.660\n That's a hazard.\n\n1:17:59.660 --> 1:18:02.340\n And the WHO and CDC as public health entities\n\n1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:07.340\n effectively oversimplify stories in order to make sense\n\n1:18:07.340 --> 1:18:11.620\n of oversimplify stories in order that that game theory\n\n1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:15.620\n does not cause a predictable tragedy of the commons.\n\n1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:19.260\n With that said, once that right to lie exists,\n\n1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:23.020\n then it turns out to serve the interests of,\n\n1:18:23.020 --> 1:18:25.100\n for example, pharmaceutical companies,\n\n1:18:25.100 --> 1:18:27.140\n which have emergency use authorizations\n\n1:18:27.140 --> 1:18:28.860\n that require that there not be a safe\n\n1:18:28.860 --> 1:18:31.980\n and effective treatment and have immunity from liability\n\n1:18:31.980 --> 1:18:34.780\n for harms caused by their product.\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:37.420\n So that's a recipe for disaster, right?\n\n1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.980\n You don't need to be a sophisticated thinker\n\n1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:43.140\n about complex systems to see the hazard\n\n1:18:43.140 --> 1:18:48.140\n of immunizing a company from the harm of its own product\n\n1:18:48.300 --> 1:18:51.620\n at the same time that that product can only exist\n\n1:18:51.620 --> 1:18:55.180\n in the market if some other product that works better\n\n1:18:55.180 --> 1:18:57.100\n somehow fails to be noticed.\n\n1:18:57.100 --> 1:19:02.100\n So somehow YouTube is doing the bidding of Merck and others.\n\n1:19:02.380 --> 1:19:03.980\n Whether it knows that that's what it's doing,\n\n1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:05.020\n I have no idea.\n\n1:19:05.020 --> 1:19:08.380\n I think this may be another case of an autopilot\n\n1:19:08.380 --> 1:19:09.660\n that thinks it's doing the right thing\n\n1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:12.980\n because it's parroting the corrupt wisdom\n\n1:19:12.980 --> 1:19:14.340\n of the WHO and the CDC,\n\n1:19:14.340 --> 1:19:17.020\n but the WHO and the CDC have been wrong again and again\n\n1:19:17.020 --> 1:19:18.100\n in this pandemic.\n\n1:19:18.100 --> 1:19:22.260\n And the irony here is that with YouTube coming after me,\n\n1:19:22.260 --> 1:19:25.620\n well, my channel has been right where the WHO and CDC\n\n1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:29.060\n have been wrong consistently over the whole pandemic.\n\n1:19:29.060 --> 1:19:32.980\n So how is it that YouTube is censoring us\n\n1:19:32.980 --> 1:19:35.140\n because the WHO and CDC disagree with us\n\n1:19:35.140 --> 1:19:36.940\n when in fact, in past disagreements,\n\n1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:38.620\n we've been right and they've been wrong?\n\n1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:41.500\n There's so much to talk about here.\n\n1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:46.500\n So I've heard this many times actually\n\n1:19:47.060 --> 1:19:49.820\n on the inside of YouTube and with colleagues\n\n1:19:49.820 --> 1:19:54.820\n that I've talked with is they kind of in a very casual way\n\n1:19:55.540 --> 1:19:59.620\n say their job is simply to slow\n\n1:19:59.620 --> 1:20:03.820\n or prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\n1:20:03.820 --> 1:20:06.940\n And they say like, that's an easy thing to do.\n\n1:20:06.940 --> 1:20:11.780\n Like to know what is true or not is an easy thing to do.\n\n1:20:11.780 --> 1:20:14.300\n And so from the YouTube perspective,\n\n1:20:14.300 --> 1:20:19.300\n I think they basically outsource of the task\n\n1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:25.340\n of knowing what is true or not to public institutions\n\n1:20:25.340 --> 1:20:29.260\n that on a basic Google search claim\n\n1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:30.980\n to be the arbiters of truth.\n\n1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:37.980\n So if you were YouTube who are exceptionally profitable\n\n1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:43.300\n and exceptionally powerful in terms of controlling\n\n1:20:43.300 --> 1:20:46.980\n what people get to see or not, what would you do?\n\n1:20:46.980 --> 1:20:49.820\n Would you take a stand, a public stand\n\n1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:52.900\n against the WHO, CDC?\n\n1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:57.460\n Or would you instead say, you know what?\n\n1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:02.460\n Let's open the dam and let any video on anything fly.\n\n1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:04.900\n What do you do here?\n\n1:21:04.900 --> 1:21:08.420\n Say you were put, if Brent Weinstein was put in charge\n\n1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:13.180\n of YouTube for a month in this most critical of times\n\n1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:16.100\n where YouTube actually has incredible amounts of power\n\n1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:20.900\n to educate the populace, to give power of knowledge\n\n1:21:20.900 --> 1:21:24.260\n to the populace such that they can reform institutions.\n\n1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:25.100\n What would you do?\n\n1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:26.820\n How would you run YouTube?\n\n1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:29.540\n Well, unfortunately, or fortunately,\n\n1:21:29.540 --> 1:21:31.540\n this is actually quite simple.\n\n1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:34.700\n The founders, the American founders,\n\n1:21:34.700 --> 1:21:37.900\n settled on a counterintuitive formulation\n\n1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:41.100\n that people should be free to say anything.\n\n1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:43.340\n They should be free from the government\n\n1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:45.380\n blocking them from doing so.\n\n1:21:45.380 --> 1:21:48.620\n They did not imagine that in formulating that right,\n\n1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:51.460\n that most of what was said would be of high quality,\n\n1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:54.500\n nor did they imagine it would be free of harmful things.\n\n1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:57.660\n What they correctly reasoned was that the benefit\n\n1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:02.460\n of leaving everything so it can be said exceeds the cost,\n\n1:22:02.460 --> 1:22:04.820\n which everyone understands to be substantial.\n\n1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:08.660\n What I would say is they could not have anticipated\n\n1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:13.580\n the impact, the centrality of platforms\n\n1:22:13.580 --> 1:22:16.980\n like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, et cetera.\n\n1:22:16.980 --> 1:22:20.140\n If they had, they would not have limited\n\n1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:21.980\n the First Amendment as they did.\n\n1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:24.820\n They clearly understood that the power of the federal\n\n1:22:24.820 --> 1:22:29.820\n government was so great that it needed to be limited\n\n1:22:29.820 --> 1:22:32.900\n by granting explicitly the right of citizens\n\n1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:33.820\n to say anything.\n\n1:22:34.820 --> 1:22:39.820\n In fact, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook may be more powerful\n\n1:22:39.940 --> 1:22:42.100\n in this moment than the federal government\n\n1:22:42.100 --> 1:22:44.140\n of their worst nightmares could have been.\n\n1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:47.620\n The power that these entities have to control thought\n\n1:22:47.620 --> 1:22:50.300\n and to shift civilization is so great\n\n1:22:50.300 --> 1:22:52.420\n that we need to have those same protections.\n\n1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.500\n It doesn't mean that harmful things won't be said,\n\n1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:56.380\n but it means that nothing has changed\n\n1:22:56.380 --> 1:22:59.020\n about the cost benefit analysis\n\n1:22:59.020 --> 1:23:01.060\n of building the right to censor.\n\n1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:03.260\n So if I were running YouTube,\n\n1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:06.100\n the limit of what should be allowed\n\n1:23:06.100 --> 1:23:08.380\n is the limit of the law, right?\n\n1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:10.580\n If what you are doing is legal,\n\n1:23:10.580 --> 1:23:12.420\n then it should not be YouTube's place\n\n1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:15.620\n to limit what gets said or who gets to hear it.\n\n1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:18.060\n That is between speakers and audience.\n\n1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:20.420\n Will harm come from that? Of course it will.\n\n1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:22.940\n But will net harm come from it?\n\n1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:24.260\n No, I don't believe it will.\n\n1:23:24.260 --> 1:23:26.220\n I believe that allowing everything to be said\n\n1:23:26.220 --> 1:23:29.100\n does allow a process in which better ideas\n\n1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:31.060\n do come to the fore and win out.\n\n1:23:31.060 --> 1:23:33.820\n So you believe that in the end,\n\n1:23:33.820 --> 1:23:37.580\n when there's complete freedom to share ideas,\n\n1:23:37.580 --> 1:23:38.900\n that truth will win out.\n\n1:23:39.780 --> 1:23:44.020\n So what I've noticed, just as a brief side comment,\n\n1:23:44.020 --> 1:23:48.300\n that certain things become viral\n\n1:23:48.300 --> 1:23:49.980\n irregardless of their truth.\n\n1:23:51.020 --> 1:23:55.900\n I've noticed that things that are dramatic and or funny,\n\n1:23:55.900 --> 1:23:58.540\n like things that become memes are not,\n\n1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:00.740\n don't have to be grounded in truth.\n\n1:24:00.740 --> 1:24:03.140\n And so that what worries me there\n\n1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:08.140\n is that we basically maximize for drama\n\n1:24:08.420 --> 1:24:10.380\n versus maximize for truth in a system\n\n1:24:10.380 --> 1:24:12.820\n where everything is free.\n\n1:24:12.820 --> 1:24:16.260\n And that is worrying in the time of emergency.\n\n1:24:16.260 --> 1:24:18.900\n Well, yes, it's all worrying in time of emergency,\n\n1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:19.740\n to be sure.\n\n1:24:19.740 --> 1:24:22.300\n But I want you to notice that what you've happened on\n\n1:24:22.300 --> 1:24:25.460\n is actually an analog for a much deeper and older problem.\n\n1:24:26.740 --> 1:24:31.500\n Human beings are the, we are not a blank slate,\n\n1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:34.060\n but we are the blankest slate that nature has ever devised.\n\n1:24:34.060 --> 1:24:35.540\n And there's a reason for that, right?\n\n1:24:35.540 --> 1:24:37.820\n It's where our flexibility comes from.\n\n1:24:39.340 --> 1:24:42.500\n We have effectively, we are robots\n\n1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:47.060\n in which a large fraction of the cognitive capacity\n\n1:24:47.060 --> 1:24:50.500\n has been, or of the behavioral capacity,\n\n1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:52.500\n has been offloaded to the software layer,\n\n1:24:52.500 --> 1:24:55.500\n which gets written and rewritten over evolutionary time.\n\n1:24:57.060 --> 1:25:00.980\n That means effectively that much of what we are,\n\n1:25:00.980 --> 1:25:02.700\n in fact, the important part of what we are\n\n1:25:02.700 --> 1:25:06.340\n is housed in the cultural layer and the conscious layer\n\n1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:08.900\n and not in the hardware hard coding layer.\n\n1:25:08.900 --> 1:25:13.900\n So that layer is prone to make errors, right?\n\n1:25:14.300 --> 1:25:17.740\n And anybody who's watched a child grow up\n\n1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:20.660\n knows that children make absurd errors all the time, right?\n\n1:25:20.660 --> 1:25:24.220\n That's part of the process, as we were discussing earlier.\n\n1:25:24.220 --> 1:25:26.540\n It is also true that as you look across\n\n1:25:26.540 --> 1:25:29.580\n a field of people discussing things,\n\n1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:33.020\n a lot of what is said is pure nonsense, it's garbage.\n\n1:25:33.020 --> 1:25:37.500\n But the tendency of garbage to emerge\n\n1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:39.820\n and even to spread in the short term\n\n1:25:39.820 --> 1:25:41.900\n does not say that over the long term,\n\n1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:45.900\n what sticks is not the valuable ideas.\n\n1:25:45.900 --> 1:25:49.780\n So there is a high tendency for novelty\n\n1:25:49.780 --> 1:25:51.300\n to be created in the cultural space,\n\n1:25:51.300 --> 1:25:54.020\n but there's also a high tendency for it to go extinct.\n\n1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:55.300\n And you have to keep that in mind.\n\n1:25:55.300 --> 1:25:57.100\n It's not like the genome, right?\n\n1:25:57.100 --> 1:25:59.460\n Everything is happening at a much higher rate.\n\n1:25:59.460 --> 1:26:01.500\n Things are being created, they're being destroyed.\n\n1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:04.620\n And I can't say that, I mean, obviously,\n\n1:26:04.620 --> 1:26:08.060\n we've seen totalitarianism arise many times,\n\n1:26:08.060 --> 1:26:10.620\n and it's very destructive each time it does.\n\n1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:13.100\n So it's not like, hey, freedom to come up\n\n1:26:13.100 --> 1:26:16.460\n with any idea you want hasn't produced a whole lot of carnage.\n\n1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:18.580\n But the question is, over time,\n\n1:26:18.580 --> 1:26:23.100\n does it produce more open, fairer, more decent societies?\n\n1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:24.580\n And I believe that it does.\n\n1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:27.620\n I can't prove it, but that does seem to be the pattern.\n\n1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:29.660\n I believe so as well.\n\n1:26:29.660 --> 1:26:34.660\n The thing is, in the short term, freedom of speech,\n\n1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:38.740\n absolute freedom of speech can be quite destructive.\n\n1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:42.580\n But you nevertheless have to hold on to that,\n\n1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:46.860\n because in the long term, I think you and I, I guess,\n\n1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:50.500\n are optimistic in the sense that good ideas will win out.\n\n1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:54.780\n I don't know how strongly I believe that it will work,\n\n1:26:54.780 --> 1:26:56.620\n but I will say I haven't heard a better idea.\n\n1:26:56.620 --> 1:27:01.620\n I would also point out that there's something\n\n1:27:01.780 --> 1:27:06.340\n very significant in this question of the hubris involved\n\n1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:08.980\n in imagining that you're going to improve the discussion\n\n1:27:08.980 --> 1:27:13.980\n by censoring, which is the majority of concepts\n\n1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:16.860\n at the fringe are nonsense.\n\n1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:19.580\n That's automatic.\n\n1:27:19.580 --> 1:27:23.260\n But the heterodoxy at the fringe,\n\n1:27:23.260 --> 1:27:25.980\n which is indistinguishable at the beginning\n\n1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:30.340\n from the nonsense ideas, is the key to progress.\n\n1:27:30.340 --> 1:27:34.220\n So if you decide, hey, the fringe is 99% garbage,\n\n1:27:34.220 --> 1:27:35.860\n let's just get rid of it, right?\n\n1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:36.900\n Hey, that's a strong win.\n\n1:27:36.900 --> 1:27:40.620\n We're getting rid of 99% garbage for 1% something or other.\n\n1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:42.740\n And the point is, yeah, but that 1% something or other\n\n1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:43.820\n is the key.\n\n1:27:43.820 --> 1:27:45.500\n You're throwing out the key.\n\n1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:48.380\n And so that's what YouTube is doing.\n\n1:27:48.380 --> 1:27:50.900\n Frankly, I think at the point that it started censoring\n\n1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:53.900\n my channel, in the immediate aftermath\n\n1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:56.660\n of this major reversal over LabLeak,\n\n1:27:56.660 --> 1:27:57.900\n it should have looked at itself and said,\n\n1:27:57.900 --> 1:27:59.500\n well, what the hell are we doing?\n\n1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:00.340\n Who are we censoring?\n\n1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:03.260\n We're censoring somebody who was just right, right?\n\n1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:05.300\n In a conflict with the very same people\n\n1:28:05.300 --> 1:28:07.540\n on whose behalf we are now censoring, right?\n\n1:28:07.540 --> 1:28:09.380\n That should have caused them to wake up.\n\n1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:11.420\n So you said one approach, if you're on YouTube,\n\n1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:15.540\n is this basically let all videos go\n\n1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:16.900\n that do not violate the law.\n\n1:28:16.900 --> 1:28:18.500\n Well, I should fix that, okay?\n\n1:28:18.500 --> 1:28:20.700\n I believe that that is the basic principle.\n\n1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:23.460\n Eric makes an excellent point about the distinction\n\n1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:26.740\n between ideas and personal attacks,\n\n1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:28.420\n doxxing, these other things.\n\n1:28:28.420 --> 1:28:31.420\n So I agree, there's no value in allowing people\n\n1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:33.180\n to destroy each other's lives,\n\n1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:36.780\n even if there's a technical legal defense for it.\n\n1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:39.100\n Now, how you draw that line, I don't know.\n\n1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:41.620\n But what I'm talking about is,\n\n1:28:41.620 --> 1:28:44.060\n yes, people should be free to traffic in bad ideas,\n\n1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:47.140\n and they should be free to expose that the ideas are bad.\n\n1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:49.020\n And hopefully that process results\n\n1:28:49.020 --> 1:28:50.620\n in better ideas winning out.\n\n1:28:50.620 --> 1:28:55.260\n Yeah, there's an interesting line between ideas,\n\n1:28:55.260 --> 1:28:56.620\n like the earth is flat,\n\n1:28:56.620 --> 1:28:59.980\n which I believe you should not censor.\n\n1:28:59.980 --> 1:29:04.380\n And then you start to encroach on personal attacks.\n\n1:29:04.380 --> 1:29:08.460\n So not doxxing, yes, but not even getting to that.\n\n1:29:08.460 --> 1:29:10.700\n There's a certain point where it's like,\n\n1:29:10.700 --> 1:29:13.420\n that's no longer ideas, that's more,\n\n1:29:15.380 --> 1:29:18.460\n that's somehow not productive, even if it's wrong.\n\n1:29:18.460 --> 1:29:20.900\n It feels like believing the earth is flat\n\n1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:22.380\n is somehow productive,\n\n1:29:22.380 --> 1:29:25.780\n because maybe there's a tiny percent chance it is.\n\n1:29:27.420 --> 1:29:31.380\n It just feels like personal attacks, it doesn't,\n\n1:29:31.380 --> 1:29:33.420\n well, I'm torn on this\n\n1:29:33.420 --> 1:29:36.060\n because there's assholes in this world,\n\n1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:37.780\n there's fraudulent people in this world.\n\n1:29:37.780 --> 1:29:40.740\n So sometimes personal attacks are useful to reveal that,\n\n1:29:41.780 --> 1:29:44.780\n but there's a line you can cross.\n\n1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:48.460\n There's a comedy where people make fun of others.\n\n1:29:48.460 --> 1:29:50.820\n I think that's amazing, that's very powerful,\n\n1:29:50.820 --> 1:29:53.180\n and that's very useful, even if it's painful.\n\n1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:55.820\n But then there's like, once it gets to be,\n\n1:29:57.420 --> 1:29:58.460\n yeah, there's a certain line,\n\n1:29:58.460 --> 1:30:00.140\n it's a gray area where you cross,\n\n1:30:00.140 --> 1:30:04.940\n where it's no longer in any possible world productive.\n\n1:30:04.940 --> 1:30:07.660\n And that's a really weird gray area\n\n1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:09.260\n for YouTube to operate in.\n\n1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:12.620\n And that feels like it should be a crowdsource thing,\n\n1:30:12.620 --> 1:30:13.820\n where people vote on it.\n\n1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:16.540\n But then again, do you trust the majority to vote\n\n1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:19.060\n on what is crossing the line and not?\n\n1:30:19.060 --> 1:30:21.100\n I mean, this is where,\n\n1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:24.180\n this is really interesting on this particular,\n\n1:30:24.180 --> 1:30:27.220\n like the scientific aspect of this.\n\n1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:30.980\n Do you think YouTube should take more of a stance,\n\n1:30:30.980 --> 1:30:35.780\n not censoring, but to actually have scientists\n\n1:30:35.780 --> 1:30:39.020\n within YouTube having these kinds of discussions,\n\n1:30:39.020 --> 1:30:42.180\n and then be able to almost speak out in a transparent way,\n\n1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:45.180\n this is what we're going to let this video stand,\n\n1:30:45.180 --> 1:30:47.580\n but here's all these other opinions.\n\n1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:49.820\n Almost like take a more active role\n\n1:30:49.820 --> 1:30:52.460\n in its recommendation system,\n\n1:30:52.460 --> 1:30:55.420\n in trying to present a full picture to you.\n\n1:30:55.420 --> 1:30:57.180\n Right now they're not,\n\n1:30:57.180 --> 1:31:01.020\n the recommender systems are not human fine tuned.\n\n1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.100\n They're all based on how you click,\n\n1:31:03.100 --> 1:31:05.460\n and there's this clustering algorithms.\n\n1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:07.180\n They're not taking an active role\n\n1:31:07.180 --> 1:31:09.580\n on giving you the full spectrum of ideas\n\n1:31:09.580 --> 1:31:11.060\n in the space of science.\n\n1:31:11.060 --> 1:31:12.980\n They just censor or not.\n\n1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:15.020\n Well, at the moment,\n\n1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:17.260\n it's gonna be pretty hard to compel me\n\n1:31:17.260 --> 1:31:18.820\n that these people should be trusted\n\n1:31:18.820 --> 1:31:22.500\n with any sort of curation or comment\n\n1:31:22.500 --> 1:31:24.700\n on matters of evidence,\n\n1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:26.060\n because they have demonstrated\n\n1:31:26.060 --> 1:31:28.060\n that they are incapable of doing it well.\n\n1:31:29.340 --> 1:31:30.900\n You could make such an argument,\n\n1:31:30.900 --> 1:31:34.260\n and I guess I'm open to the idea of institutions\n\n1:31:34.260 --> 1:31:36.300\n that would look something like YouTube,\n\n1:31:36.300 --> 1:31:39.060\n that would be capable of offering something valuable.\n\n1:31:39.060 --> 1:31:41.300\n I mean, and even just the fact of them\n\n1:31:41.300 --> 1:31:43.700\n literally curating things and putting some videos\n\n1:31:43.700 --> 1:31:47.580\n next to others implies something.\n\n1:31:47.580 --> 1:31:49.540\n So yeah, there's a question to be answered,\n\n1:31:49.540 --> 1:31:51.700\n but at the moment, no.\n\n1:31:51.700 --> 1:31:53.300\n At the moment, what it is doing\n\n1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:57.300\n is quite literally putting not only individual humans\n\n1:31:57.300 --> 1:32:00.700\n in tremendous jeopardy by censoring discussion\n\n1:32:00.700 --> 1:32:04.460\n of useful tools and making tools that are more hazardous\n\n1:32:04.460 --> 1:32:07.420\n than has been acknowledged seem safe, right?\n\n1:32:07.420 --> 1:32:10.540\n But it is also placing humanity in danger\n\n1:32:10.540 --> 1:32:13.580\n of a permanent relationship with this pathogen.\n\n1:32:13.580 --> 1:32:16.820\n I cannot emphasize enough how expensive that is.\n\n1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:18.820\n It's effectively incalculable.\n\n1:32:18.820 --> 1:32:20.500\n If the relationship becomes permanent,\n\n1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:23.100\n the number of people who will ultimately suffer\n\n1:32:23.100 --> 1:32:26.100\n and die from it is indefinitely large.\n\n1:32:26.100 --> 1:32:30.220\n Yeah, currently the algorithm is very rabbit hole driven,\n\n1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:35.220\n meaning if you click on Flat Earth videos,\n\n1:32:35.220 --> 1:32:38.580\n that's all you're going to be presented with\n\n1:32:38.580 --> 1:32:40.980\n and you're not going to be nicely presented\n\n1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:42.900\n with arguments against the Flat Earth.\n\n1:32:42.900 --> 1:32:44.580\n And the flip side of that,\n\n1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:48.580\n if you watch like quantum mechanics videos\n\n1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:50.820\n or no, general relativity videos,\n\n1:32:50.820 --> 1:32:53.180\n it's very rare you're going to get a recommendation.\n\n1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:54.980\n Have you considered the Earth is flat?\n\n1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:56.580\n And I think you should have both.\n\n1:32:57.540 --> 1:32:58.980\n Same with vaccine.\n\n1:32:58.980 --> 1:33:01.660\n Videos that present the power and the incredible\n\n1:33:01.660 --> 1:33:06.660\n like biology, genetics, virology about the vaccine,\n\n1:33:06.700 --> 1:33:09.820\n you're rarely going to get videos\n\n1:33:09.820 --> 1:33:14.420\n from well respected scientific minds\n\n1:33:14.420 --> 1:33:16.700\n presenting possible dangers of the vaccine.\n\n1:33:16.700 --> 1:33:19.140\n And the vice versa is true as well,\n\n1:33:19.140 --> 1:33:22.060\n which is if you're looking at the dangers of the vaccine\n\n1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:25.620\n on YouTube, you're not going to get the highest quality\n\n1:33:25.620 --> 1:33:27.140\n of videos recommended to you.\n\n1:33:27.140 --> 1:33:30.860\n And I'm not talking about like manually inserted CDC videos\n\n1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:33.700\n that are like the most untrustworthy things\n\n1:33:33.700 --> 1:33:35.980\n you can possibly watch about how everybody\n\n1:33:35.980 --> 1:33:38.380\n should take the vaccine, it's the safest thing ever.\n\n1:33:38.380 --> 1:33:42.060\n No, it's about incredible, again, MIT colleagues of mine,\n\n1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:45.300\n incredible biologists, virologists that talk about\n\n1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:49.100\n the details of how the mRNA vaccines work\n\n1:33:49.100 --> 1:33:50.500\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:33:50.500 --> 1:33:55.460\n I think maybe this is me with the AI hat on,\n\n1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:58.100\n is I think the algorithm can fix a lot of this\n\n1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:00.500\n and YouTube should build better algorithms\n\n1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:05.500\n and trust that to a couple of complete freedom of speech\n\n1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:10.860\n to expand what people are able to think about,\n\n1:34:10.860 --> 1:34:12.500\n present always varied views,\n\n1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:16.300\n not balanced in some artificial way, hard coded way,\n\n1:34:16.300 --> 1:34:18.740\n but balanced in a way that's crowdsourced.\n\n1:34:18.740 --> 1:34:21.500\n I think that's an algorithm problem that can be solved\n\n1:34:21.500 --> 1:34:25.460\n because then you can delegate it to the algorithm\n\n1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:29.580\n as opposed to this hard code censorship\n\n1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:34.300\n of basically creating artificial boundaries\n\n1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:36.140\n on what can and can't be discussed,\n\n1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:39.860\n instead creating a full spectrum of exploration\n\n1:34:39.860 --> 1:34:43.220\n that can be done and trusting the intelligence of people\n\n1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:45.340\n to do the exploration.\n\n1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:47.060\n Well, there's a lot there.\n\n1:34:47.060 --> 1:34:49.260\n I would say we have to keep in mind\n\n1:34:49.260 --> 1:34:53.660\n that we're talking about a publicly held company\n\n1:34:53.660 --> 1:34:55.900\n with shareholders and obligations to them\n\n1:34:55.900 --> 1:34:57.860\n and that that may make it impossible.\n\n1:34:57.860 --> 1:35:01.540\n And I remember many years ago,\n\n1:35:01.540 --> 1:35:03.820\n back in the early days of Google,\n\n1:35:03.820 --> 1:35:08.820\n I remember a sense of terror at the loss of general search.\n\n1:35:10.780 --> 1:35:14.220\n It used to be that Google, if you searched,\n\n1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:16.100\n came up with the same thing for everyone\n\n1:35:16.100 --> 1:35:19.260\n and then it got personalized and for a while\n\n1:35:19.260 --> 1:35:21.460\n it was possible to turn off the personalization,\n\n1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:22.780\n which was still not great\n\n1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:24.140\n because if everybody else is looking\n\n1:35:24.140 --> 1:35:26.780\n at a personalized search and you can tune into one\n\n1:35:26.780 --> 1:35:30.460\n that isn't personalized, that doesn't tell you\n\n1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:33.020\n why the world is sounding the way it is.\n\n1:35:33.020 --> 1:35:34.740\n But nonetheless, it was at least an option.\n\n1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:35.940\n And then that vanished.\n\n1:35:35.940 --> 1:35:40.020\n And the problem is I think this is literally deranging us.\n\n1:35:40.020 --> 1:35:43.420\n That in effect, I mean, what you're describing\n\n1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:44.380\n is unthinkable.\n\n1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:48.180\n It is unthinkable that in the face of a campaign\n\n1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:51.780\n to vaccinate people in order to reach herd immunity\n\n1:35:51.780 --> 1:35:56.780\n that YouTube would give you videos on hazards of vaccines\n\n1:35:59.060 --> 1:36:02.140\n when this is, how hazardous the vaccines are\n\n1:36:02.140 --> 1:36:04.020\n is an unsettled question.\n\n1:36:04.020 --> 1:36:06.020\n Why is it unthinkable?\n\n1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:09.580\n That doesn't make any sense from a company perspective.\n\n1:36:09.580 --> 1:36:14.580\n If intelligent people in large amounts are open minded\n\n1:36:16.380 --> 1:36:19.100\n and are thinking through the hazards\n\n1:36:19.100 --> 1:36:23.500\n and the benefits of a vaccine, a company should find\n\n1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:28.500\n the best videos to present what people are thinking about.\n\n1:36:28.740 --> 1:36:30.780\n Well, let's come up with a hypothetical.\n\n1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:34.820\n Okay, let's come up with a very deadly disease\n\n1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:37.780\n for which there's a vaccine that is very safe,\n\n1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:40.060\n though not perfectly safe.\n\n1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:43.940\n And we are then faced with YouTube trying to figure out\n\n1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:47.300\n what to do for somebody searching on vaccine safety.\n\n1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:50.140\n Suppose it is necessary in order to drive\n\n1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:53.140\n the pathogen to extinction, something like smallpox,\n\n1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:55.340\n that people get on board with the vaccine.\n\n1:36:57.180 --> 1:36:59.740\n But there's a tiny fringe of people who thinks\n\n1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:03.340\n that the vaccine is a mind control agent.\n\n1:37:05.460 --> 1:37:10.460\n So should YouTube direct people to the only claims\n\n1:37:11.340 --> 1:37:13.780\n against this vaccine, which is that it's a mind control\n\n1:37:13.780 --> 1:37:18.780\n agent when in fact the vaccine is very safe,\n\n1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:22.380\n whatever that means.\n\n1:37:22.380 --> 1:37:25.500\n If that were the actual configuration of the puzzle,\n\n1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:28.020\n then YouTube would be doing active harm,\n\n1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:33.020\n pointing you to this other video potentially.\n\n1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:36.340\n Now, yes, I would love to live in a world where people\n\n1:37:36.340 --> 1:37:39.100\n are up to the challenge of sorting that out.\n\n1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:42.780\n But my basic point would be, if it's an evidentiary\n\n1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:45.820\n question, and there is essentially no evidence\n\n1:37:45.820 --> 1:37:48.180\n that the vaccine is a mind control agent,\n\n1:37:48.180 --> 1:37:50.780\n and there's plenty of evidence that the vaccine is safe,\n\n1:37:50.780 --> 1:37:52.700\n then while you look for this video,\n\n1:37:52.700 --> 1:37:55.340\n we're gonna give you this one, puts it on a par, right?\n\n1:37:55.340 --> 1:37:59.140\n So for the mind that's tracking how much thought\n\n1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:01.740\n is there behind it's safe versus how much thought\n\n1:38:01.740 --> 1:38:04.340\n is there behind it's a mind control agent\n\n1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:07.740\n will result in artificially elevating this.\n\n1:38:07.740 --> 1:38:11.060\n Now in the current case, what we've seen is not this at all.\n\n1:38:11.060 --> 1:38:15.380\n We have seen evidence obscured in order to create\n\n1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:18.060\n a false story about safety.\n\n1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:22.060\n And we saw the inverse with ivermectin.\n\n1:38:22.060 --> 1:38:27.060\n We saw a campaign to portray the drug as more dangerous\n\n1:38:27.780 --> 1:38:29.260\n and less effective than the evidence\n\n1:38:29.260 --> 1:38:30.940\n clearly suggested it was.\n\n1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:33.900\n So we're not talking about a comparable thing,\n\n1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:36.060\n but I guess my point is the algorithmic solution\n\n1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:39.740\n that you point to creates a problem of its own,\n\n1:38:39.740 --> 1:38:42.820\n which is that it means that the way to get exposure\n\n1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.700\n is to generate something fringy.\n\n1:38:44.700 --> 1:38:46.860\n If you're the only thing on some fringe,\n\n1:38:46.860 --> 1:38:49.700\n then suddenly YouTube would be recommending those things,\n\n1:38:49.700 --> 1:38:53.140\n and that's obviously a gameable system at best.\n\n1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:54.900\n Yeah, but the solution to that,\n\n1:38:54.900 --> 1:38:57.580\n I know you're creating a thought experiment,\n\n1:38:57.580 --> 1:39:00.780\n maybe playing a little bit of a devil's advocate.\n\n1:39:00.780 --> 1:39:03.900\n I think the solution to that is not to limit the algorithm\n\n1:39:03.900 --> 1:39:05.860\n in the case of the super deadly virus.\n\n1:39:05.860 --> 1:39:08.260\n It's for the scientists to step up\n\n1:39:08.260 --> 1:39:11.700\n and become better communicators, more charismatic,\n\n1:39:11.700 --> 1:39:15.660\n fight the battle of ideas, sort of create better videos.\n\n1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:19.220\n Like if the virus is truly deadly,\n\n1:39:19.220 --> 1:39:22.060\n you have a lot more ammunition, a lot more data,\n\n1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:23.700\n a lot more material to work with\n\n1:39:23.700 --> 1:39:26.660\n in terms of communicating with the public.\n\n1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:29.740\n So be better at communicating and stop being,\n\n1:39:30.940 --> 1:39:33.740\n you have to start trusting the intelligence of people\n\n1:39:33.740 --> 1:39:35.260\n and also being transparent\n\n1:39:35.260 --> 1:39:37.140\n and playing the game of the internet,\n\n1:39:37.140 --> 1:39:40.900\n which is like, what is the internet hungry for, I believe?\n\n1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:44.660\n Authenticity, stop looking like you're full of shit.\n\n1:39:46.220 --> 1:39:47.500\n The scientific community,\n\n1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:50.500\n if there's any flaw that I currently see,\n\n1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:53.060\n especially the people that are in public office,\n\n1:39:53.060 --> 1:39:54.500\n that like Anthony Fauci,\n\n1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:56.180\n they look like they're full of shit\n\n1:39:56.180 --> 1:39:57.860\n and I know they're brilliant.\n\n1:39:57.860 --> 1:39:59.900\n Why don't they look more authentic?\n\n1:39:59.900 --> 1:40:01.380\n So they're losing that game\n\n1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:05.100\n and I think a lot of people observing this entire system now,\n\n1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:09.420\n younger scientists are seeing this and saying,\n\n1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:12.580\n okay, if I want to continue being a scientist\n\n1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:16.100\n in the public eye and I want to be effective at my job,\n\n1:40:16.100 --> 1:40:18.140\n I'm gonna have to be a lot more authentic.\n\n1:40:18.140 --> 1:40:19.300\n So they're learning the lesson,\n\n1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:21.220\n this evolutionary system is working.\n\n1:40:22.460 --> 1:40:25.220\n So there's just a younger generation of minds coming up\n\n1:40:25.220 --> 1:40:27.100\n that I think will do a much better job\n\n1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:28.620\n in this battle of ideas\n\n1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:32.780\n that when the much more dangerous virus comes along,\n\n1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.620\n they'll be able to be better communicators.\n\n1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:35.860\n At least that's the hope.\n\n1:40:36.820 --> 1:40:40.380\n Using the algorithm to control that is,\n\n1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:41.820\n I feel like is a big problem.\n\n1:40:41.820 --> 1:40:45.140\n So you're going to have the same problem with a deadly virus\n\n1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:46.940\n as with the current virus\n\n1:40:46.940 --> 1:40:50.340\n if you let YouTube draw hard lines\n\n1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:52.780\n by the PR and the marketing people\n\n1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:55.260\n versus the broad community of scientists.\n\n1:40:56.180 --> 1:40:59.540\n Well, in some sense you're suggesting something\n\n1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:01.300\n that's close kin to what I was saying\n\n1:41:01.300 --> 1:41:05.700\n about freedom of expression ultimately\n\n1:41:05.700 --> 1:41:07.700\n provides an advantage to better ideas.\n\n1:41:07.700 --> 1:41:10.700\n So I'm in agreement broadly speaking,\n\n1:41:10.700 --> 1:41:13.620\n but I would also say there's probably some sort of,\n\n1:41:13.620 --> 1:41:15.540\n let's imagine the world that you propose\n\n1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:18.540\n where YouTube shows you the alternative point of view.\n\n1:41:19.740 --> 1:41:21.340\n That has the problem that I suggest,\n\n1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:24.700\n but one thing you could do is you could give us the tools\n\n1:41:24.700 --> 1:41:27.500\n to understand what we're looking at, right?\n\n1:41:27.500 --> 1:41:28.340\n You could give us,\n\n1:41:28.340 --> 1:41:32.900\n so first of all, there's something I think myopic,\n\n1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:37.260\n solipsistic, narcissistic about an algorithm\n\n1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:40.980\n that serves shareholders by showing you what you want to see\n\n1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:42.820\n rather than what you need to know, right?\n\n1:41:42.820 --> 1:41:45.820\n That's the distinction is flattering you,\n\n1:41:45.820 --> 1:41:47.620\n playing to your blind spot\n\n1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:49.700\n is something that algorithm will figure out,\n\n1:41:49.700 --> 1:41:51.020\n but it's not healthy for us all\n\n1:41:51.020 --> 1:41:53.460\n to have Google playing to our blind spot.\n\n1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:54.660\n It's very, very dangerous.\n\n1:41:54.660 --> 1:41:59.660\n So what I really want is analytics that allow me\n\n1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:02.260\n or maybe options and analytics.\n\n1:42:02.260 --> 1:42:05.260\n The options should allow me to see\n\n1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:09.180\n what alternative perspectives are being explored, right?\n\n1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:10.660\n So here's the thing I'm searching\n\n1:42:10.660 --> 1:42:12.260\n and it leads me down this road, right?\n\n1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:14.300\n Let's say it's ivermectin, okay?\n\n1:42:14.300 --> 1:42:16.380\n I find all of this evidence that ivermectin works.\n\n1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:17.540\n I find all of these discussions\n\n1:42:17.540 --> 1:42:20.340\n and people talk about various protocols and this and that.\n\n1:42:20.340 --> 1:42:24.260\n And then I could say, all right, what is the other side?\n\n1:42:24.260 --> 1:42:28.860\n And I could see who is searching, not as individuals,\n\n1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:32.340\n but what demographics are searching alternatives.\n\n1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:33.900\n And maybe you could even combine it\n\n1:42:33.900 --> 1:42:37.340\n with something Reddit like where effectively,\n\n1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:40.940\n let's say that there was a position that, I don't know,\n\n1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:44.260\n that a vaccine is a mind control device\n\n1:42:44.260 --> 1:42:48.940\n and you could have a steel man this argument competition\n\n1:42:48.940 --> 1:42:51.180\n effectively and the better answers that steel man\n\n1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:53.340\n and as well as possible would rise to the top.\n\n1:42:53.340 --> 1:42:56.460\n And so you could read the top three or four explanations\n\n1:42:56.460 --> 1:43:01.220\n about why this really credibly is a mind control product.\n\n1:43:01.220 --> 1:43:03.420\n And you can say, well, that doesn't really add up.\n\n1:43:03.420 --> 1:43:05.100\n I can check these three things myself\n\n1:43:05.100 --> 1:43:07.260\n and they can't possibly be right, right?\n\n1:43:07.260 --> 1:43:08.220\n And you could dismiss it.\n\n1:43:08.220 --> 1:43:10.060\n And then as an argument that was credible,\n\n1:43:10.060 --> 1:43:12.740\n let's say plate tectonics before\n\n1:43:12.740 --> 1:43:15.100\n that was an accepted concept,\n\n1:43:15.100 --> 1:43:16.860\n you'd say, wait a minute,\n\n1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:19.420\n there is evidence for plate tectonics.\n\n1:43:19.420 --> 1:43:21.220\n As crazy as it sounds that the continents\n\n1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:23.380\n are floating around on liquid,\n\n1:43:23.380 --> 1:43:26.060\n actually that's not so implausible.\n\n1:43:26.060 --> 1:43:27.940\n We've got these subduction zones,\n\n1:43:27.940 --> 1:43:30.500\n we've got a geology that is compatible,\n\n1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:31.940\n we've got puzzle piece continents\n\n1:43:31.940 --> 1:43:33.180\n that seem to fit together.\n\n1:43:33.180 --> 1:43:35.580\n Wow, that's a surprising amount of evidence\n\n1:43:35.580 --> 1:43:36.420\n for that position.\n\n1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:39.100\n So I'm gonna file some Bayesian probability with it\n\n1:43:39.100 --> 1:43:40.780\n that's updated for the fact that actually\n\n1:43:40.780 --> 1:43:43.580\n the steel man arguments better than I was expecting, right?\n\n1:43:43.580 --> 1:43:45.060\n So I could imagine something like that\n\n1:43:45.060 --> 1:43:48.020\n where A, I would love the search to be indifferent\n\n1:43:48.020 --> 1:43:49.540\n to who's searching, right?\n\n1:43:49.540 --> 1:43:51.940\n The solipsistic thing is too dangerous.\n\n1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.540\n So the search could be general,\n\n1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:54.620\n so we would all get a sense\n\n1:43:54.620 --> 1:43:56.980\n for what everybody else was seeing too.\n\n1:43:56.980 --> 1:43:59.420\n And then some layer that didn't have anything to do\n\n1:43:59.420 --> 1:44:01.940\n with what YouTube points you to or not,\n\n1:44:01.940 --> 1:44:04.300\n but allowed you to see, you know,\n\n1:44:04.300 --> 1:44:08.060\n the general pattern of adherence\n\n1:44:08.060 --> 1:44:11.740\n to searching for information.\n\n1:44:11.740 --> 1:44:14.740\n And again, a layer in which those things could be defended.\n\n1:44:14.740 --> 1:44:17.020\n So you could hear what a good argument sounded like\n\n1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:19.260\n rather than just hear a caricatured argument.\n\n1:44:19.260 --> 1:44:21.220\n Yeah, and also reward people,\n\n1:44:21.220 --> 1:44:23.860\n creators that have demonstrated\n\n1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:26.300\n like a track record of open mindedness\n\n1:44:26.300 --> 1:44:29.540\n and correctness as much as it could be measured\n\n1:44:29.540 --> 1:44:31.700\n over a long term and sort of,\n\n1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:36.860\n I mean, a lot of this maps\n\n1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:41.860\n to incentivizing good longterm behavior,\n\n1:44:41.860 --> 1:44:48.860\n not immediate kind of dopamine rush kind of signals.\n\n1:44:50.340 --> 1:44:55.340\n I think ultimately the algorithm on the individual level\n\n1:44:55.860 --> 1:44:58.780\n should optimize for personal growth,\n\n1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:04.780\n longterm happiness, just growth intellectually,\n\n1:45:04.780 --> 1:45:07.580\n growth in terms of lifestyle personally and so on,\n\n1:45:07.580 --> 1:45:10.420\n as opposed to immediate.\n\n1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.300\n I think that's going to build a better society,\n\n1:45:12.300 --> 1:45:13.500\n not even just like truth,\n\n1:45:13.500 --> 1:45:16.180\n because I think truth is a complicated thing.\n\n1:45:16.180 --> 1:45:19.300\n It's more just you growing as a person,\n\n1:45:19.300 --> 1:45:23.220\n exploring the space of ideas, changing your mind often,\n\n1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.380\n increasing the level to which you're open minded,\n\n1:45:25.380 --> 1:45:28.020\n the knowledge base you're operating from,\n\n1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.340\n the willingness to empathize with others,\n\n1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:34.140\n all those kinds of things the algorithm should optimize for.\n\n1:45:34.140 --> 1:45:37.060\n Like creating a better human at the individual level\n\n1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:40.340\n that you're, I think that's a great business model\n\n1:45:40.340 --> 1:45:44.780\n because the person that's using this tool\n\n1:45:44.780 --> 1:45:47.340\n will then be happier with themselves for having used it\n\n1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:50.780\n and will be a lifelong quote unquote customer.\n\n1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:53.380\n I think it's a great business model\n\n1:45:53.380 --> 1:45:57.020\n to make a happy, open minded, knowledgeable,\n\n1:45:57.020 --> 1:45:58.460\n better human being.\n\n1:45:58.460 --> 1:46:02.420\n It's a terrible business model under the current system.\n\n1:46:02.420 --> 1:46:04.300\n What you want is to build the system\n\n1:46:04.300 --> 1:46:05.620\n in which it is a great business model.\n\n1:46:05.620 --> 1:46:07.660\n Why is it a terrible model?\n\n1:46:07.660 --> 1:46:10.580\n Because it will be decimated by those\n\n1:46:10.580 --> 1:46:11.940\n who play to the short term.\n\n1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:14.340\n I don't think so.\n\n1:46:14.340 --> 1:46:15.180\n Why?\n\n1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:16.220\n I mean, I think we're living it.\n\n1:46:16.220 --> 1:46:17.340\n We're living it.\n\n1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:19.480\n Well, no, because if you have the alternative\n\n1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:21.020\n that presents itself,\n\n1:46:21.020 --> 1:46:24.020\n it points out the emperor has no clothes.\n\n1:46:24.020 --> 1:46:27.340\n I mean, it points out that YouTube is operating in this way,\n\n1:46:27.340 --> 1:46:29.220\n Twitter is operating in this way,\n\n1:46:29.220 --> 1:46:30.720\n Facebook is operating in this way.\n\n1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.020\n How long term would you like the wisdom to prove at?\n\n1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:40.020\n Well, even a week is better when it's currently happening.\n\n1:46:40.020 --> 1:46:42.180\n Right, but the problem is,\n\n1:46:42.180 --> 1:46:45.540\n if a week loses out to an hour, right?\n\n1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:48.220\n And I don't think it loses out.\n\n1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:49.660\n It loses out in the short term.\n\n1:46:49.660 --> 1:46:50.500\n That's my point.\n\n1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.060\n At least you're a great communicator\n\n1:46:52.060 --> 1:46:55.860\n and you basically say, look, here's the metrics.\n\n1:46:55.860 --> 1:46:59.260\n And a lot of it is like how people actually feel.\n\n1:46:59.260 --> 1:47:02.540\n Like this is what people experience with social media.\n\n1:47:02.540 --> 1:47:04.940\n They look back at the previous month and say,\n\n1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:09.140\n I felt shitty on a lot of days because of social media.\n\n1:47:09.140 --> 1:47:09.980\n Right.\n\n1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:14.660\n If you look back at the previous few weeks and say,\n\n1:47:14.660 --> 1:47:18.500\n wow, I'm a better person because of that month happened.\n\n1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:20.780\n That's, they immediately choose the product\n\n1:47:20.780 --> 1:47:22.220\n that's going to lead to that.\n\n1:47:22.220 --> 1:47:24.540\n That's what love for products looks like.\n\n1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:28.300\n If you love, like a lot of people love their Tesla car,\n\n1:47:28.300 --> 1:47:31.940\n like that's, or iPhone or like beautiful design.\n\n1:47:31.940 --> 1:47:33.060\n That's what love looks like.\n\n1:47:33.060 --> 1:47:35.340\n You look back, I'm a better person\n\n1:47:35.340 --> 1:47:36.540\n for having used this thing.\n\n1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:38.340\n Well, you got to ask yourself the question though,\n\n1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:40.260\n if this is such a great business model,\n\n1:47:40.260 --> 1:47:41.580\n why isn't it devolving?\n\n1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:44.380\n Why don't we see it?\n\n1:47:44.380 --> 1:47:46.300\n Honestly, it's competence.\n\n1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:50.740\n It's like people are just, it's not easy to build new,\n\n1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:55.540\n it's not easy to build products, tools, systems\n\n1:47:55.540 --> 1:47:57.660\n on new ideas.\n\n1:47:57.660 --> 1:47:59.100\n It's kind of a new idea.\n\n1:47:59.100 --> 1:48:01.980\n We've gone through this, everything we're seeing now\n\n1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:06.260\n comes from the ideas of the initial birth of the internet.\n\n1:48:06.260 --> 1:48:08.180\n There just needs to be new sets of tools\n\n1:48:08.180 --> 1:48:12.460\n that are incentivizing long term personal growth\n\n1:48:12.460 --> 1:48:13.420\n and happiness.\n\n1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:14.260\n That's it.\n\n1:48:14.260 --> 1:48:16.540\n Right, but what we have is a market\n\n1:48:16.540 --> 1:48:18.260\n that doesn't favor this, right?\n\n1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:23.260\n I mean, for one thing, we had an alternative to Facebook,\n\n1:48:23.580 --> 1:48:25.900\n right, that looked, you owned your own data,\n\n1:48:25.900 --> 1:48:29.820\n it wasn't exploitative and Facebook bought\n\n1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:32.460\n a huge interest in it and it died.\n\n1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:34.860\n I mean, who do you know who's on diaspora?\n\n1:48:34.860 --> 1:48:37.460\n The execution there was not good.\n\n1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:40.340\n Right, but it could have gotten better, right?\n\n1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:43.820\n I don't think that the argument that why hasn't somebody\n\n1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:47.300\n done it a good argument for it's not going to completely\n\n1:48:47.300 --> 1:48:51.060\n destroy all of Twitter and Facebook when somebody does it\n\n1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:54.660\n or Twitter will catch up and pivot to the algorithm.\n\n1:48:54.660 --> 1:48:56.340\n This is not what I'm saying.\n\n1:48:56.340 --> 1:48:59.820\n There's obviously great ideas that remain unexplored\n\n1:48:59.820 --> 1:49:01.700\n because nobody has gotten to the foothill\n\n1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:03.060\n that would allow you to explore them.\n\n1:49:03.060 --> 1:49:05.460\n That's true, but you know, an internet\n\n1:49:05.460 --> 1:49:08.700\n that was non predatory is an obvious idea\n\n1:49:08.700 --> 1:49:10.900\n and many of us know that we want it\n\n1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:13.460\n and many of us have seen prototypes of it\n\n1:49:13.460 --> 1:49:15.580\n and we don't move because there's no audience there.\n\n1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:17.680\n So the network effects cause you to stay\n\n1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:19.860\n with the predatory internet.\n\n1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:24.460\n But let me just, I wasn't kidding about build the system\n\n1:49:24.460 --> 1:49:27.620\n in which your idea is a great business plan.\n\n1:49:28.700 --> 1:49:32.620\n So in our upcoming book, Heather and I in our last chapter\n\n1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:34.780\n explore something called the fourth frontier\n\n1:49:34.780 --> 1:49:38.340\n and fourth frontier has to do with sort of a 2.0 version\n\n1:49:38.340 --> 1:49:40.500\n of civilization, which we freely admit\n\n1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:42.420\n we can't tell you very much about.\n\n1:49:42.420 --> 1:49:44.060\n It's something that would have to be,\n\n1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:45.660\n we would have to prototype our way there.\n\n1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:48.220\n We would have to effectively navigate our way there.\n\n1:49:48.220 --> 1:49:49.760\n But the result would be very much\n\n1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:51.020\n like what you're describing.\n\n1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:54.740\n It would be something that effectively liberates humans\n\n1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:57.860\n meaningfully and most importantly,\n\n1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:02.220\n it has to feel like growth without depending on growth.\n\n1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:05.140\n In other words, human beings are creatures\n\n1:50:05.140 --> 1:50:07.140\n that like every other creature\n\n1:50:07.140 --> 1:50:09.700\n is effectively looking for growth, right?\n\n1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:11.580\n We are looking for underexploited\n\n1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:14.860\n or unexploited opportunities and when we find them,\n\n1:50:14.860 --> 1:50:18.260\n our ancestors for example, they happen into a new valley\n\n1:50:18.260 --> 1:50:20.660\n that was unexplored by people.\n\n1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:23.300\n Their population would grow until it hit carrying capacity.\n\n1:50:23.300 --> 1:50:25.660\n So there would be this great feeling of there's abundance\n\n1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:27.940\n until you hit carrying capacity, which is inevitable\n\n1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:30.500\n and then zero sum dynamics would set in.\n\n1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:34.040\n So in order for human beings to flourish longterm,\n\n1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:37.900\n the way to get there is to satisfy the desire for growth\n\n1:50:37.900 --> 1:50:39.680\n without hooking it to actual growth,\n\n1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:42.420\n which only moves and fits and starts.\n\n1:50:42.420 --> 1:50:45.340\n And this is actually, I believe the key\n\n1:50:45.340 --> 1:50:48.940\n to avoiding these spasms of human tragedy\n\n1:50:48.940 --> 1:50:50.660\n when in the absence of growth,\n\n1:50:50.660 --> 1:50:54.100\n people do something that causes their population\n\n1:50:54.100 --> 1:50:57.780\n to experience growth, which is they go and make war on\n\n1:50:57.780 --> 1:50:59.980\n or commit genocide against some other population,\n\n1:50:59.980 --> 1:51:02.960\n which is something we obviously have to stop.\n\n1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:06.080\n By the way, this is a hunter gatherers guide\n\n1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:08.420\n to the 21st century coauthored.\n\n1:51:08.420 --> 1:51:09.260\n That's right.\n\n1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:11.220\n With your wife, Heather, being released in September.\n\n1:51:11.220 --> 1:51:13.620\n I believe you said you're going to do\n\n1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.100\n a little bit of a preview videos on each chapter\n\n1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:17.260\n leading up to the release.\n\n1:51:17.260 --> 1:51:19.740\n So I'm looking forward to the last chapter\n\n1:51:19.740 --> 1:51:23.140\n as well as all the previous ones.\n\n1:51:23.140 --> 1:51:24.620\n I have a few questions on that.\n\n1:51:24.620 --> 1:51:29.620\n So you generally have faith to clarify that technology\n\n1:51:30.340 --> 1:51:35.340\n could be the thing that empowers this kind of future.\n\n1:51:36.380 --> 1:51:40.540\n Well, if you just let technology evolve,\n\n1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:43.580\n it's going to be our undoing, right?\n\n1:51:43.580 --> 1:51:48.280\n One of the things that I fault my libertarian friends for\n\n1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:51.360\n is this faith that the market is going to find solutions\n\n1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:52.580\n without destroying us.\n\n1:51:52.580 --> 1:51:56.220\n And my sense is I'm a very strong believer in markets.\n\n1:51:56.220 --> 1:51:57.700\n I believe in their power\n\n1:51:57.700 --> 1:52:00.280\n even above some market fundamentalists.\n\n1:52:00.280 --> 1:52:03.980\n But what I don't believe is that they should be allowed\n\n1:52:03.980 --> 1:52:06.400\n to plot our course, right?\n\n1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:09.940\n Markets are very good at figuring out how to do things.\n\n1:52:09.940 --> 1:52:12.140\n They are not good at all about figuring out\n\n1:52:12.140 --> 1:52:13.660\n what we should do, right?\n\n1:52:13.660 --> 1:52:14.900\n What we should want.\n\n1:52:14.900 --> 1:52:16.660\n We have to tell markets what we want\n\n1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:19.060\n and then they can tell us how to do it best.\n\n1:52:19.060 --> 1:52:22.980\n And if we adopted that kind of pro market\n\n1:52:22.980 --> 1:52:25.780\n but in a context where it's not steering,\n\n1:52:25.780 --> 1:52:28.900\n where human wellbeing is actually the driver,\n\n1:52:28.900 --> 1:52:30.920\n we can do remarkable things.\n\n1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:32.300\n And the technology that emerges\n\n1:52:32.300 --> 1:52:35.420\n would naturally be enhancing of human wellbeing.\n\n1:52:35.420 --> 1:52:36.340\n Perfectly so?\n\n1:52:36.340 --> 1:52:38.720\n No, but overwhelmingly so.\n\n1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:40.860\n But at the moment, markets are finding\n\n1:52:40.860 --> 1:52:43.660\n our every defective character and exploiting them\n\n1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:44.940\n and making huge profits\n\n1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:48.260\n and making us worse to each other in the process.\n\n1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:52.500\n Before we leave COVID 19,\n\n1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:56.400\n let me ask you about a very difficult topic,\n\n1:52:57.580 --> 1:52:59.280\n which is the vaccines.\n\n1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:03.840\n So I took the Pfizer vaccine, the two shots.\n\n1:53:05.300 --> 1:53:06.300\n You did not.\n\n1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:10.500\n You have been taking ivermectin.\n\n1:53:10.500 --> 1:53:11.340\n Yep.\n\n1:53:12.580 --> 1:53:15.060\n So one of the arguments\n\n1:53:15.060 --> 1:53:17.540\n against the discussion of ivermectin\n\n1:53:17.540 --> 1:53:21.140\n is that it prevents people\n\n1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:24.980\n from being fully willing to get the vaccine.\n\n1:53:24.980 --> 1:53:27.820\n How would you compare ivermectin\n\n1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:30.540\n and the vaccine for COVID 19?\n\n1:53:31.660 --> 1:53:33.380\n All right, that's a good question.\n\n1:53:33.380 --> 1:53:34.620\n I would say, first of all,\n\n1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:37.100\n there are some hazards with the vaccine\n\n1:53:37.100 --> 1:53:38.500\n that people need to be aware of.\n\n1:53:38.500 --> 1:53:41.300\n There are some things that we cannot rule out\n\n1:53:41.300 --> 1:53:44.420\n and for which there is some evidence.\n\n1:53:44.420 --> 1:53:46.780\n The two that I think people should be tracking\n\n1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:50.780\n is the possibility, some would say a likelihood,\n\n1:53:50.780 --> 1:53:53.640\n that a vaccine of this nature,\n\n1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:58.640\n that is to say very narrowly focused on a single antigen,\n\n1:53:58.940 --> 1:54:02.380\n is an evolutionary pressure\n\n1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:05.100\n that will drive the emergence of variants\n\n1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:06.620\n that will escape the protection\n\n1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:08.740\n that comes from the vaccine.\n\n1:54:08.740 --> 1:54:11.660\n So this is a hazard.\n\n1:54:11.660 --> 1:54:14.020\n It is a particular hazard in light of the fact\n\n1:54:14.020 --> 1:54:16.800\n that these vaccines have a substantial number\n\n1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:18.900\n of breakthrough cases.\n\n1:54:18.900 --> 1:54:22.520\n So one danger is that a person who has been vaccinated\n\n1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:27.520\n will shed viruses that are specifically less visible\n\n1:54:27.620 --> 1:54:30.720\n or invisible to the immunity created by the vaccines.\n\n1:54:31.900 --> 1:54:34.260\n So we may be creating the next pandemic\n\n1:54:34.260 --> 1:54:37.340\n by applying the pressure of vaccines\n\n1:54:37.340 --> 1:54:39.440\n at a point that it doesn't make sense to.\n\n1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:42.580\n The other danger has to do with something called\n\n1:54:42.580 --> 1:54:45.260\n antibody dependent enhancement,\n\n1:54:45.260 --> 1:54:47.200\n which is something that we see in certain diseases\n\n1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:48.760\n like dengue fever.\n\n1:54:48.760 --> 1:54:51.680\n You may know that dengue, one gets a case,\n\n1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:54.100\n and then their second case is much more devastating.\n\n1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:57.260\n So break bone fever is when you get your second case\n\n1:54:57.260 --> 1:55:00.760\n of dengue, and dengue effectively utilizes\n\n1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:04.620\n the immune response that is produced by prior exposure\n\n1:55:04.620 --> 1:55:06.900\n to attack the body in ways that it is incapable\n\n1:55:06.900 --> 1:55:08.860\n of doing before exposure.\n\n1:55:08.860 --> 1:55:12.020\n So this is apparently, this pattern has apparently blocked\n\n1:55:12.020 --> 1:55:17.020\n past efforts to make vaccines against coronaviruses.\n\n1:55:17.420 --> 1:55:19.240\n Whether it will happen here or not,\n\n1:55:19.240 --> 1:55:20.460\n it is still too early to say.\n\n1:55:20.460 --> 1:55:22.780\n But before we even get to the question\n\n1:55:22.780 --> 1:55:26.940\n of harm done to individuals by these vaccines,\n\n1:55:26.940 --> 1:55:29.660\n we have to ask about what the overall impact is going to be.\n\n1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:32.260\n And it's not clear in the way people think it is\n\n1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:35.460\n that if we vaccinate enough people, the pandemic will end.\n\n1:55:35.460 --> 1:55:37.040\n It could be that we vaccinate people\n\n1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:38.700\n and make the pandemic worse.\n\n1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:40.600\n And while nobody can say for sure\n\n1:55:40.600 --> 1:55:42.080\n that that's where we're headed,\n\n1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:43.860\n it is at least something to be aware of.\n\n1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:46.160\n So don't vaccines usually create\n\n1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:48.940\n that kind of evolutionary pressure\n\n1:55:48.940 --> 1:55:53.000\n to create deadlier, different strains of the virus?\n\n1:55:55.160 --> 1:55:58.740\n So is there something particular with these mRNA vaccines\n\n1:55:58.740 --> 1:56:01.380\n that's uniquely dangerous in this regard?\n\n1:56:01.380 --> 1:56:03.440\n Well, it's not even just the mRNA vaccines.\n\n1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:07.140\n The mRNA vaccines and the adenovector DNA vaccine\n\n1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:09.060\n all share the same vulnerability,\n\n1:56:09.060 --> 1:56:11.220\n which is they are very narrowly focused\n\n1:56:11.220 --> 1:56:14.180\n on one subunit of the spike protein.\n\n1:56:14.180 --> 1:56:18.180\n So that is a very concentrated evolutionary signal.\n\n1:56:18.180 --> 1:56:20.900\n We are also deploying it in mid pandemic\n\n1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:23.460\n and it takes time for immunity to develop.\n\n1:56:23.460 --> 1:56:25.760\n So part of the problem here,\n\n1:56:25.760 --> 1:56:29.740\n if you inoculated a population before encounter\n\n1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:32.940\n with a pathogen, then there might be substantially\n\n1:56:32.940 --> 1:56:37.300\n enough immunity to prevent this phenomenon from happening.\n\n1:56:37.300 --> 1:56:40.440\n But in this case, we are inoculating people\n\n1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:43.980\n as they are encountering those who are sick with the disease.\n\n1:56:43.980 --> 1:56:47.320\n And what that means is the disease is now faced\n\n1:56:47.320 --> 1:56:48.560\n with a lot of opportunities\n\n1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:52.420\n to effectively evolutionarily practice escape strategies.\n\n1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:54.660\n So one thing is the timing,\n\n1:56:54.660 --> 1:56:56.780\n the other thing is the narrow focus.\n\n1:56:56.780 --> 1:56:58.360\n Now in a traditional vaccine,\n\n1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:01.200\n you would typically not have one antigen, right?\n\n1:57:01.200 --> 1:57:04.300\n You would have basically a virus full of antigens\n\n1:57:04.300 --> 1:57:06.100\n and the immune system would therefore\n\n1:57:06.100 --> 1:57:08.100\n produce a broader response.\n\n1:57:08.100 --> 1:57:11.860\n So that is the case for people who have had COVID, right?\n\n1:57:11.860 --> 1:57:13.360\n They have an immunity that is broader\n\n1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:14.860\n because it wasn't so focused\n\n1:57:14.860 --> 1:57:17.060\n on one part of the spike protein.\n\n1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:19.220\n So anyway, there is something unique here.\n\n1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:21.820\n So these platforms create that special hazard.\n\n1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:25.300\n They also have components that we haven't used before\n\n1:57:25.300 --> 1:57:26.140\n in people.\n\n1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:28.240\n So for example, the lipid nanoparticles\n\n1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:32.580\n that coat the RNAs are distributing themselves\n\n1:57:32.580 --> 1:57:36.280\n around the body in a way that will have unknown consequences.\n\n1:57:37.500 --> 1:57:40.180\n So anyway, there's reason for concern.\n\n1:57:40.180 --> 1:57:45.020\n Is it possible for you to steel man the argument\n\n1:57:45.020 --> 1:57:48.020\n that everybody should get vaccinated?\n\n1:57:48.020 --> 1:57:49.060\n Of course.\n\n1:57:49.060 --> 1:57:51.380\n The argument that everybody should get vaccinated\n\n1:57:51.380 --> 1:57:54.660\n is that nothing is perfectly safe.\n\n1:57:54.660 --> 1:57:59.580\n Phase three trials showed good safety for the vaccines.\n\n1:57:59.580 --> 1:58:01.980\n Now that may or may not be actually true,\n\n1:58:01.980 --> 1:58:05.980\n but what we saw suggested high degree of efficacy\n\n1:58:05.980 --> 1:58:09.780\n and a high degree of safety for the vaccines\n\n1:58:09.780 --> 1:58:11.780\n that inoculating people quickly\n\n1:58:11.780 --> 1:58:15.700\n and therefore dropping the landscape of available victims\n\n1:58:15.700 --> 1:58:19.400\n for the pathogen to a very low number\n\n1:58:19.400 --> 1:58:22.020\n so that herd immunity drives it to extinction\n\n1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:24.580\n requires us all to take our share of the risk\n\n1:58:25.540 --> 1:58:30.380\n and that because driving it to extinction\n\n1:58:30.380 --> 1:58:32.460\n should be our highest priority that really\n\n1:58:32.460 --> 1:58:36.680\n people shouldn't think too much about the various nuances\n\n1:58:36.680 --> 1:58:39.700\n because overwhelmingly fewer people will die\n\n1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:43.180\n if the population is vaccinated from the vaccine\n\n1:58:43.180 --> 1:58:45.340\n than will die from COVID if they're not vaccinated.\n\n1:58:45.340 --> 1:58:48.180\n And with the vaccine as it currently is being deployed,\n\n1:58:48.180 --> 1:58:50.380\n that is a quite a likely scenario\n\n1:58:51.300 --> 1:58:56.300\n that everything, you know, the virus will fade away.\n\n1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:01.500\n In the following sense that the probability\n\n1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:05.980\n that a more dangerous strain will be created is nonzero,\n\n1:59:05.980 --> 1:59:10.140\n but it's not 50%, it's something smaller.\n\n1:59:10.140 --> 1:59:11.900\n And so the most likely, well, I don't know,\n\n1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:12.800\n maybe you disagree with that,\n\n1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:15.620\n but the scenario we're most likely to see now\n\n1:59:15.620 --> 1:59:19.140\n that the vaccine is here is that the virus,\n\n1:59:19.140 --> 1:59:21.620\n the effects of the virus will fade away.\n\n1:59:21.620 --> 1:59:23.520\n First of all, I don't believe that the probability\n\n1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:27.380\n of creating a worse pandemic is low enough to discount.\n\n1:59:27.380 --> 1:59:29.420\n I think the probability is fairly high\n\n1:59:29.420 --> 1:59:32.900\n and frankly, we are seeing a wave of variants\n\n1:59:32.900 --> 1:59:37.140\n that we will have to do a careful analysis\n\n1:59:37.140 --> 1:59:39.060\n to figure out what exactly that has to do\n\n1:59:39.060 --> 1:59:40.740\n with campaigns of vaccination,\n\n1:59:40.740 --> 1:59:42.340\n where they have been, where they haven't been,\n\n1:59:42.340 --> 1:59:43.940\n where the variants emerged from.\n\n1:59:43.940 --> 1:59:47.100\n But I believe that what we are seeing is a disturbing pattern\n\n1:59:47.100 --> 1:59:50.860\n that reflects that those who were advising caution\n\n1:59:50.860 --> 1:59:51.860\n may well have been right.\n\n1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:55.260\n The data here, by the way, and the small tangent is terrible.\n\n1:59:55.260 --> 1:59:56.500\n Terrible, right.\n\n1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:59.700\n And why is it terrible is another question, right?\n\n1:59:59.700 --> 2:00:01.280\n This is where I started getting angry.\n\n2:00:01.280 --> 2:00:02.120\n Yes.\n\n2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.160\n It's like, there's an obvious opportunity\n\n2:00:04.160 --> 2:00:07.660\n for exceptionally good data, for exceptionally rigorous,\n\n2:00:07.660 --> 2:00:10.580\n like even the self, like the website for self reporting,\n\n2:00:10.580 --> 2:00:12.580\n side effects for, not side effects,\n\n2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.180\n but negative effects, right?\n\n2:00:14.180 --> 2:00:15.020\n Adverse events.\n\n2:00:15.020 --> 2:00:17.120\n Adverse events, sorry, for the vaccine.\n\n2:00:18.540 --> 2:00:20.560\n Like, there's many things I could say\n\n2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:22.240\n from both the study perspective,\n\n2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:27.240\n but mostly, let me just put on my hat of like HTML\n\n2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:29.840\n and like web design.\n\n2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:32.700\n Like, it's like the worst website.\n\n2:00:32.700 --> 2:00:34.800\n It makes it so unpleasant to report.\n\n2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:37.100\n It makes it so unclear what you're reporting.\n\n2:00:37.100 --> 2:00:38.860\n If somebody actually has serious effect,\n\n2:00:38.860 --> 2:00:40.640\n like if you have very mild effects,\n\n2:00:40.640 --> 2:00:43.280\n what are the incentives for you to even use\n\n2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:46.420\n that crappy website with many pages and forms\n\n2:00:46.420 --> 2:00:47.660\n that don't make any sense?\n\n2:00:47.660 --> 2:00:49.200\n If you have adverse effects,\n\n2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:53.180\n what are the incentives for you to use that website?\n\n2:00:53.180 --> 2:00:55.100\n What is the trust that you have\n\n2:00:55.100 --> 2:00:56.980\n that this information will be used well?\n\n2:00:56.980 --> 2:00:58.220\n All those kinds of things.\n\n2:00:58.220 --> 2:01:01.140\n And the data about who's getting vaccinated,\n\n2:01:01.140 --> 2:01:04.180\n anonymized data about who's getting vaccinated,\n\n2:01:04.180 --> 2:01:06.940\n where, when, with what vaccine,\n\n2:01:06.940 --> 2:01:09.040\n coupled with the adverse effects,\n\n2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:10.940\n all of that we should be collecting.\n\n2:01:10.940 --> 2:01:13.340\n Instead, we're completely not.\n\n2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:14.980\n We're doing it in a crappy way\n\n2:01:14.980 --> 2:01:18.040\n and using that crappy data to make conclusions\n\n2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:19.620\n that you then twist.\n\n2:01:19.620 --> 2:01:21.160\n You're basically collecting in a way\n\n2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:25.700\n that can arrive at whatever conclusions you want.\n\n2:01:25.700 --> 2:01:29.500\n And the data is being collected by the institutions,\n\n2:01:29.500 --> 2:01:31.460\n by governments, and so therefore,\n\n2:01:31.460 --> 2:01:33.020\n it's obviously they're going to try\n\n2:01:33.020 --> 2:01:35.540\n to construct any kind of narratives they want\n\n2:01:35.540 --> 2:01:36.660\n based on this crappy data.\n\n2:01:36.660 --> 2:01:39.740\n Reminds me of much of psychology, the field that I love,\n\n2:01:39.740 --> 2:01:42.620\n but is flawed in many fundamental ways.\n\n2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:46.780\n So rant over, but coupled with the dangers\n\n2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:47.620\n that you're speaking to,\n\n2:01:47.620 --> 2:01:52.160\n we don't have even the data to understand the dangers.\n\n2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:55.660\n Yeah, I'm gonna pick up on your rant and say,\n\n2:01:55.660 --> 2:02:00.660\n we, estimates of the degree of underreporting in VAERS\n\n2:02:00.660 --> 2:02:05.660\n are that it is 10% of the real to 100%.\n\n2:02:05.660 --> 2:02:08.020\n And that's the system for reporting.\n\n2:02:08.020 --> 2:02:10.020\n Yeah, the VAERS system is the system\n\n2:02:10.020 --> 2:02:11.140\n for reporting adverse events.\n\n2:02:11.140 --> 2:02:16.140\n So in the US, we have above 5,000 unexpected deaths\n\n2:02:18.180 --> 2:02:22.000\n that seem in time to be associated with vaccination.\n\n2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.460\n That is an undercount, almost certainly,\n\n2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:27.940\n and by a large factor.\n\n2:02:27.940 --> 2:02:29.020\n We don't know how large.\n\n2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:34.020\n I've seen estimates, 25,000 dead in the US alone.\n\n2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:37.880\n Now, you can make the argument that, okay,\n\n2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.280\n that's a large number,\n\n2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:42.860\n but the necessity of immunizing the population\n\n2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:45.420\n to drive SARS CoV2 to extinction\n\n2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:47.960\n is such that it's an acceptable number.\n\n2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:48.860\n But I would point out\n\n2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:51.000\n that that actually does not make any sense.\n\n2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:52.680\n And the reason it doesn't make any sense\n\n2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:54.280\n is actually there are several reasons.\n\n2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:57.180\n One, if that was really your point,\n\n2:02:57.180 --> 2:02:59.940\n that yes, many, many people are gonna die,\n\n2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:02.080\n but many more will die if we don't do this.\n\n2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:05.140\n Were that your approach,\n\n2:03:05.140 --> 2:03:08.660\n you would not be inoculating people who had had COVID 19,\n\n2:03:08.660 --> 2:03:10.620\n which is a large population.\n\n2:03:10.620 --> 2:03:13.260\n There's no reason to expose those people to danger.\n\n2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:14.860\n Their risk of adverse events\n\n2:03:14.860 --> 2:03:18.280\n in the case that they have them is greater.\n\n2:03:18.280 --> 2:03:20.580\n So there's no reason that we would be allowing\n\n2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:22.300\n those people to face a risk of death\n\n2:03:22.300 --> 2:03:25.620\n if this was really about an acceptable number of deaths\n\n2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:29.180\n arising out of this set of vaccines.\n\n2:03:29.180 --> 2:03:30.500\n I would also point out\n\n2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:32.800\n there's something incredibly bizarre.\n\n2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:37.800\n And I struggle to find language that is strong enough\n\n2:03:37.940 --> 2:03:42.940\n for the horror of vaccinating children in this case\n\n2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:48.180\n because children suffer a greater risk of longterm effects\n\n2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:49.820\n because they are going to live longer.\n\n2:03:49.820 --> 2:03:51.900\n And because this is earlier in their development,\n\n2:03:51.900 --> 2:03:55.640\n therefore it impacts systems that are still forming.\n\n2:03:55.640 --> 2:03:57.860\n They tolerate COVID well.\n\n2:03:57.860 --> 2:04:01.420\n And so the benefit to them is very small.\n\n2:04:01.420 --> 2:04:04.060\n And so the only argument for doing this\n\n2:04:04.060 --> 2:04:06.420\n is that they may cryptically be carrying more COVID\n\n2:04:06.420 --> 2:04:09.600\n than we think, and therefore they may be integral\n\n2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:11.900\n to the way the virus spreads to the population.\n\n2:04:11.900 --> 2:04:14.260\n But if that's the reason that we are inoculating children,\n\n2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:16.460\n and there has been some revision in the last day or two\n\n2:04:16.460 --> 2:04:17.860\n about the recommendation on this\n\n2:04:17.860 --> 2:04:19.780\n because of the adverse events\n\n2:04:19.780 --> 2:04:20.980\n that have shown up in children,\n\n2:04:20.980 --> 2:04:24.160\n but to the extent that we were vaccinating children,\n\n2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:28.240\n we were doing it to protect old, infirm people\n\n2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:32.700\n who are the most likely to succumb to COVID 19.\n\n2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:37.100\n What society puts children in danger,\n\n2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:40.860\n robs children of life to save old, infirm people?\n\n2:04:40.860 --> 2:04:42.160\n That's upside down.\n\n2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:46.820\n So there's something about the way we are going about\n\n2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:48.700\n vaccinating, who we are vaccinating,\n\n2:04:48.700 --> 2:04:52.300\n what dangers we are pretending don't exist\n\n2:04:52.300 --> 2:04:55.700\n that suggests that to some set of people,\n\n2:04:55.700 --> 2:04:58.660\n vaccinating people is a good in and of itself,\n\n2:04:58.660 --> 2:05:00.460\n that that is the objective of the exercise,\n\n2:05:00.460 --> 2:05:01.540\n not herd immunity.\n\n2:05:01.540 --> 2:05:03.060\n And the last thing, and I'm sorry,\n\n2:05:03.060 --> 2:05:05.540\n I don't wanna prevent you from jumping in here,\n\n2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:07.500\n but the second reason, in addition to the fact\n\n2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:09.180\n that we're exposing people to danger\n\n2:05:09.180 --> 2:05:11.820\n that we should not be exposing them to.\n\n2:05:11.820 --> 2:05:13.700\n By the way, as a tiny tangent,\n\n2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:16.220\n another huge part of this soup\n\n2:05:16.220 --> 2:05:17.540\n that should have been part of it\n\n2:05:17.540 --> 2:05:20.860\n that's an incredible solution is large scale testing.\n\n2:05:20.860 --> 2:05:22.020\n Mm hmm.\n\n2:05:22.020 --> 2:05:26.440\n But that might be another couple hour conversation,\n\n2:05:26.440 --> 2:05:28.660\n but there's these solutions that are obvious\n\n2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:30.580\n that were available from the very beginning.\n\n2:05:30.580 --> 2:05:34.720\n So you could argue that iveractin is not that obvious,\n\n2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:38.780\n but maybe the whole point is you have aggressive,\n\n2:05:38.780 --> 2:05:43.120\n very fast research that leads to a meta analysis\n\n2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:46.140\n and then large scale production and deployment.\n\n2:05:46.140 --> 2:05:49.020\n Okay, at least that possibility\n\n2:05:49.020 --> 2:05:51.220\n should be seriously considered,\n\n2:05:51.220 --> 2:05:53.620\n coupled with a serious consideration\n\n2:05:53.620 --> 2:05:55.700\n of large scale deployment of testing,\n\n2:05:55.700 --> 2:06:00.100\n at home testing that could have accelerated\n\n2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:05.100\n the speed at which we reached that herd immunity.\n\n2:06:07.060 --> 2:06:08.660\n But I don't even wanna.\n\n2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:11.720\n Well, let me just say, I am also completely shocked\n\n2:06:11.720 --> 2:06:15.040\n that we did not get on high quality testing early\n\n2:06:15.040 --> 2:06:19.060\n and that we are still suffering from this even now,\n\n2:06:19.060 --> 2:06:21.580\n because just the simple ability to track\n\n2:06:21.580 --> 2:06:23.740\n where the virus moves between people\n\n2:06:23.740 --> 2:06:26.120\n would tell us a lot about its mode of transmission,\n\n2:06:26.120 --> 2:06:28.860\n which would allow us to protect ourselves better.\n\n2:06:28.860 --> 2:06:32.340\n Instead, that information was hard won\n\n2:06:32.340 --> 2:06:33.260\n and for no good reason.\n\n2:06:33.260 --> 2:06:35.900\n So I also find this mysterious.\n\n2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:39.940\n You've spoken with Eric Weinstein, your brother,\n\n2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:41.460\n on his podcast, The Portal,\n\n2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:45.180\n about the ideas that eventually led to the paper\n\n2:06:45.180 --> 2:06:48.660\n you published titled, The Reserved Capacity Hypothesis.\n\n2:06:50.500 --> 2:06:55.500\n I think first, can you explain this paper\n\n2:06:56.540 --> 2:06:59.900\n and the ideas that led up to it?\n\n2:06:59.900 --> 2:07:04.000\n Sure, easier to explain the conclusion of the paper.\n\n2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:08.340\n There's a question about why a creature\n\n2:07:08.340 --> 2:07:11.980\n that can replace its cells with new cells\n\n2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:14.940\n grows feeble and inefficient with age.\n\n2:07:14.940 --> 2:07:18.540\n We call that process, which is otherwise called aging,\n\n2:07:18.540 --> 2:07:19.860\n we call it senescence.\n\n2:07:20.940 --> 2:07:25.940\n And senescence, in this paper, it is hypothesized,\n\n2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:31.000\n is the unavoidable downside of a cancer prevention\n\n2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:36.300\n feature of our bodies.\n\n2:07:36.300 --> 2:07:39.820\n That each cell has a limit on the number of times\n\n2:07:39.820 --> 2:07:40.740\n it can divide.\n\n2:07:40.740 --> 2:07:42.980\n There are a few cells in the body that are exceptional,\n\n2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:45.000\n but most of our cells can only divide\n\n2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:46.060\n a limited number of times.\n\n2:07:46.060 --> 2:07:47.860\n That's called the Hayflick limit.\n\n2:07:47.860 --> 2:07:52.460\n And the Hayflick limit reduces the ability\n\n2:07:52.460 --> 2:07:55.740\n of the organism to replace tissues.\n\n2:07:55.740 --> 2:07:58.780\n It therefore results in a failure over time\n\n2:07:58.780 --> 2:08:01.340\n of maintenance and repair.\n\n2:08:01.340 --> 2:08:06.180\n And that explains why we become decrepit as we grow old.\n\n2:08:06.180 --> 2:08:09.460\n The question was why would that be,\n\n2:08:09.460 --> 2:08:12.900\n especially in light of the fact that the mechanism\n\n2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:16.580\n that seems to limit the ability of cells to reproduce\n\n2:08:16.580 --> 2:08:18.820\n is something called a telomere.\n\n2:08:18.820 --> 2:08:22.940\n Telomere is a, it's not a gene, but it's a DNA sequence\n\n2:08:22.940 --> 2:08:24.880\n at the ends of our chromosomes\n\n2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:26.340\n that is just simply repetitive.\n\n2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:30.240\n And the number of repeats functions like a counter.\n\n2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:33.000\n So there's a number of repeats that you have\n\n2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:34.420\n after development is finished.\n\n2:08:34.420 --> 2:08:36.260\n And then each time the cell divides a little bit\n\n2:08:36.260 --> 2:08:37.620\n of telomere is lost.\n\n2:08:37.620 --> 2:08:40.260\n And at the point that the telomere becomes critically short,\n\n2:08:40.260 --> 2:08:42.820\n the cell stops dividing even though it still has\n\n2:08:42.820 --> 2:08:44.660\n the capacity to do so.\n\n2:08:44.660 --> 2:08:47.420\n Stops dividing and it starts transcribing different genes\n\n2:08:47.420 --> 2:08:50.300\n than it did when it had more telomere.\n\n2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:53.900\n So what my work did was it looked at the fact\n\n2:08:53.900 --> 2:08:56.700\n that the telomeric shortening was being studied\n\n2:08:56.700 --> 2:08:57.900\n by two different groups.\n\n2:08:57.900 --> 2:09:00.820\n It was being studied by people who were interested\n\n2:09:00.820 --> 2:09:03.460\n in counteracting the aging process.\n\n2:09:03.460 --> 2:09:06.540\n And it was being studied in exactly the opposite fashion\n\n2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:10.500\n by people who were interested in tumorigenesis and cancer.\n\n2:09:10.500 --> 2:09:13.300\n The thought being because it was true that when one looked\n\n2:09:13.300 --> 2:09:16.700\n into tumors, they always had telomerase active.\n\n2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:19.040\n That's the enzyme that lengthens our telomeres.\n\n2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:24.040\n So those folks were interested in bringing about a halt\n\n2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:25.700\n to the lengthening of telomeres\n\n2:09:25.700 --> 2:09:27.540\n in order to counteract cancer.\n\n2:09:27.540 --> 2:09:30.640\n And the folks who were studying the senescence process\n\n2:09:30.640 --> 2:09:32.280\n were interested in lengthening telomeres\n\n2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:35.780\n in order to generate greater repair capacity.\n\n2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:38.660\n And my point was evolutionarily speaking,\n\n2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:42.900\n this looks like a pleiotropic effect\n\n2:09:42.900 --> 2:09:47.900\n that the genes which create the tendency of the cells\n\n2:09:49.980 --> 2:09:53.340\n to be limited in their capacity to replace themselves\n\n2:09:53.340 --> 2:09:55.580\n are providing a benefit in youth,\n\n2:09:55.580 --> 2:09:59.320\n which is that we are largely free of tumors and cancer\n\n2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:02.300\n at the inevitable late life cost that we grow feeble\n\n2:10:02.300 --> 2:10:04.840\n and inefficient and eventually die.\n\n2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:09.840\n And that matches a very old hypothesis in evolutionary theory\n\n2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:13.540\n by somebody I was fortunate enough to know, George Williams,\n\n2:10:13.540 --> 2:10:16.620\n one of the great 20th century evolutionists\n\n2:10:16.620 --> 2:10:19.760\n who argued that senescence would have to be caused\n\n2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:23.780\n by pleiotropic genes that cause early life benefits\n\n2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:26.160\n at unavoidable late life costs.\n\n2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:29.220\n And although this isn't the exact nature of the system,\n\n2:10:29.220 --> 2:10:32.740\n he predicted it matches what he was expecting\n\n2:10:32.740 --> 2:10:35.880\n in many regards to a shocking degree.\n\n2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:40.880\n That said, the focus of the paper is about the,\n\n2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.880\n well, let me just read the abstract.\n\n2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:47.460\n We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols designed,\n\n2:10:47.460 --> 2:10:49.060\n this is the end of the abstract.\n\n2:10:49.060 --> 2:10:51.500\n We observed that captive rodent breeding protocols\n\n2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:53.660\n designed to increase reproductive output,\n\n2:10:53.660 --> 2:10:55.780\n simultaneously exert strong selection\n\n2:10:55.780 --> 2:10:58.040\n against reproductive senescence\n\n2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:00.140\n and virtually eliminate selection\n\n2:11:00.140 --> 2:11:03.260\n that would otherwise favor tumor suppression.\n\n2:11:03.260 --> 2:11:05.740\n This appears to have greatly elongated\n\n2:11:05.740 --> 2:11:07.940\n the telomeres of laboratory mice.\n\n2:11:07.940 --> 2:11:10.780\n With their telomeric failsafe effectively disabled,\n\n2:11:10.780 --> 2:11:12.620\n these animals are unreliable models\n\n2:11:12.620 --> 2:11:15.300\n of normal senescence and tumor formation.\n\n2:11:15.300 --> 2:11:19.660\n So basically using these mice is not going to lead\n\n2:11:19.660 --> 2:11:21.500\n to the right kinds of conclusions.\n\n2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:24.180\n Safety tests employing these animals\n\n2:11:24.180 --> 2:11:26.700\n likely overestimate cancer risks\n\n2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:29.020\n and underestimate tissue damage\n\n2:11:29.020 --> 2:11:31.700\n and consequent accelerated senescence.\n\n2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:37.280\n So I think, especially with your discussion with Eric,\n\n2:11:38.180 --> 2:11:43.180\n the conclusion of this paper has to do with the fact that,\n\n2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:48.500\n like we shouldn't be using these mice to test the safety\n\n2:11:48.500 --> 2:11:53.300\n or to make conclusions about cancer or senescence.\n\n2:11:53.300 --> 2:11:55.060\n Is that the basic takeaway?\n\n2:11:55.060 --> 2:11:57.820\n Like basically saying that the length of these telomeres\n\n2:11:57.820 --> 2:12:00.100\n is an important variable to consider.\n\n2:12:00.100 --> 2:12:01.980\n Well, let's put it this way.\n\n2:12:01.980 --> 2:12:05.780\n I think there was a reason that the world of scientists\n\n2:12:05.780 --> 2:12:07.540\n who was working on telomeres\n\n2:12:07.540 --> 2:12:10.920\n did not spot the pleiotropic relationship\n\n2:12:10.920 --> 2:12:15.360\n that was the key argument in my paper.\n\n2:12:16.300 --> 2:12:19.580\n The reason they didn't spot it was that there was a result\n\n2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:22.060\n that everybody knew, which seemed inconsistent.\n\n2:12:22.060 --> 2:12:26.980\n The result was that mice have very long telomeres,\n\n2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:30.260\n but they do not have very long lives.\n\n2:12:30.260 --> 2:12:32.480\n Now, we can talk about what the actual meaning\n\n2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:34.560\n of don't have very long lives is,\n\n2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:39.220\n but in the end, I was confronted with a hypothesis\n\n2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:41.580\n that would explain a great many features\n\n2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:44.780\n of the way mammals and indeed vertebrates age,\n\n2:12:44.780 --> 2:12:46.660\n but it was inconsistent with one result.\n\n2:12:46.660 --> 2:12:48.340\n And at first I thought,\n\n2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:50.020\n maybe there's something wrong with the result.\n\n2:12:50.020 --> 2:12:51.340\n Maybe this is one of these cases\n\n2:12:51.340 --> 2:12:54.380\n where the result was achieved once\n\n2:12:54.380 --> 2:12:56.460\n through some bad protocol and everybody else\n\n2:12:56.460 --> 2:12:58.760\n was repeating it, didn't turn out to be the case.\n\n2:12:58.760 --> 2:13:00.440\n Many laboratories had established\n\n2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:02.860\n that mice had ultra long telomeres.\n\n2:13:02.860 --> 2:13:05.320\n And so I began to wonder whether or not\n\n2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:09.580\n there was something about the breeding protocols\n\n2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:11.220\n that generated these mice.\n\n2:13:11.220 --> 2:13:13.860\n And what that would predict is that the mice\n\n2:13:13.860 --> 2:13:16.940\n that have long telomeres would be laboratory mice\n\n2:13:16.940 --> 2:13:18.700\n and that wild mice would not.\n\n2:13:18.700 --> 2:13:23.180\n And Carol Greider, who agreed to collaborate with me,\n\n2:13:23.180 --> 2:13:27.620\n tested that hypothesis and showed that it was indeed true,\n\n2:13:27.620 --> 2:13:29.900\n that wild derived mice, or at least mice\n\n2:13:29.900 --> 2:13:32.700\n that had been in captivity for a much shorter period of time\n\n2:13:32.700 --> 2:13:35.180\n did not have ultra long telomeres.\n\n2:13:35.180 --> 2:13:38.660\n Now, what this implied though, as you read,\n\n2:13:38.660 --> 2:13:41.100\n is that our breeding protocols\n\n2:13:41.100 --> 2:13:43.080\n generate lengthening of telomeres.\n\n2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.700\n And the implication of that is that the animals\n\n2:13:45.700 --> 2:13:47.400\n that have these very long telomeres\n\n2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:50.500\n will be hyper prone to create tumors.\n\n2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:54.420\n They will be extremely resistant to toxins\n\n2:13:54.420 --> 2:13:56.900\n because they have effectively an infinite capacity\n\n2:13:56.900 --> 2:13:58.940\n to replace any damaged tissue.\n\n2:13:58.940 --> 2:14:02.660\n And so ironically, if you give one of these\n\n2:14:02.660 --> 2:14:06.460\n ultra long telomere lab mice a toxin,\n\n2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:08.320\n if the toxin doesn't outright kill it,\n\n2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:10.840\n it may actually increase its lifespan\n\n2:14:10.840 --> 2:14:14.300\n because it functions as a kind of chemotherapy.\n\n2:14:14.300 --> 2:14:16.940\n So the reason that chemotherapy works\n\n2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:19.180\n is that dividing cells are more vulnerable\n\n2:14:19.180 --> 2:14:21.100\n than cells that are not dividing.\n\n2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:23.540\n And so if this mouse has effectively\n\n2:14:23.540 --> 2:14:26.280\n had its cancer protection turned off,\n\n2:14:26.280 --> 2:14:28.500\n and it has cells dividing too rapidly,\n\n2:14:28.500 --> 2:14:31.420\n and you give it a toxin, you will slow down its tumors\n\n2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:33.980\n faster than you harm its other tissues.\n\n2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:35.700\n And so you'll get a paradoxical result\n\n2:14:35.700 --> 2:14:38.300\n that actually some drug that's toxic\n\n2:14:38.300 --> 2:14:40.460\n seems to benefit the mouse.\n\n2:14:40.460 --> 2:14:43.140\n Now, I don't think that that was understood\n\n2:14:43.140 --> 2:14:44.720\n before I published my paper.\n\n2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:46.820\n Now I'm pretty sure it has to be.\n\n2:14:46.820 --> 2:14:50.700\n And the problem is that this actually is a system\n\n2:14:50.700 --> 2:14:53.180\n that serves pharmaceutical companies\n\n2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:57.180\n that have the difficult job of bringing compounds to market,\n\n2:14:57.180 --> 2:14:59.420\n many of which will be toxic.\n\n2:14:59.420 --> 2:15:01.780\n Maybe all of them will be toxic.\n\n2:15:01.780 --> 2:15:04.780\n And these mice predispose our system\n\n2:15:04.780 --> 2:15:07.580\n to declare these toxic compounds safe.\n\n2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:10.460\n And in fact, I believe we've seen the errors\n\n2:15:10.460 --> 2:15:12.940\n that result from using these mice a number of times,\n\n2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:15.540\n most famously with Vioxx, which turned out\n\n2:15:15.540 --> 2:15:18.180\n to do conspicuous heart damage.\n\n2:15:18.180 --> 2:15:20.700\n Why do you think this paper and this idea\n\n2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:23.700\n has not gotten significant traction?\n\n2:15:23.700 --> 2:15:27.580\n Well, my collaborator, Carol Greider,\n\n2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:32.180\n said something to me that rings in my ears to this day.\n\n2:15:32.180 --> 2:15:35.780\n She initially, after she showed that laboratory mice\n\n2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:37.380\n have anomalously long telomeres\n\n2:15:37.380 --> 2:15:39.980\n and that wild mice don't have long telomeres,\n\n2:15:39.980 --> 2:15:42.300\n I asked her where she was going to publish that result\n\n2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:44.500\n so that I could cite it in my paper.\n\n2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:47.460\n And she said that she was going to keep the result in house\n\n2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:49.780\n rather than publish it.\n\n2:15:49.780 --> 2:15:54.020\n And at the time, I was a young graduate student.\n\n2:15:54.020 --> 2:15:56.780\n I didn't really understand what she was saying.\n\n2:15:56.780 --> 2:16:01.420\n But in some sense, the knowledge that a model organism\n\n2:16:01.420 --> 2:16:04.780\n is broken in a way that creates the likelihood\n\n2:16:04.780 --> 2:16:08.260\n that certain results will be reliably generateable,\n\n2:16:08.260 --> 2:16:10.700\n you can publish a paper and make a big splash\n\n2:16:10.700 --> 2:16:13.300\n with such a thing, or you can exploit the fact\n\n2:16:13.300 --> 2:16:16.100\n that you know how those models will misbehave\n\n2:16:16.100 --> 2:16:17.660\n and other people don't.\n\n2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:22.300\n So there's a question, if somebody is motivated cynically\n\n2:16:22.300 --> 2:16:25.540\n and what they want to do is appear to have deeper insight\n\n2:16:25.540 --> 2:16:27.580\n into biology because they predict things\n\n2:16:27.580 --> 2:16:31.100\n better than others do, knowing where the flaw is\n\n2:16:31.100 --> 2:16:34.940\n so that your predictions come out true is advantageous.\n\n2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:38.900\n At the same time, I can't help but imagine\n\n2:16:38.900 --> 2:16:40.100\n that the pharmaceutical industry,\n\n2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:42.660\n when it figured out that the mice were predisposed\n\n2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:45.700\n to suggest that drugs were safe,\n\n2:16:45.700 --> 2:16:49.040\n didn't leap to fix the problem because in some sense,\n\n2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:51.740\n it was the perfect cover for the difficult job\n\n2:16:51.740 --> 2:16:55.460\n of bringing drugs to market and then discovering\n\n2:16:55.460 --> 2:16:57.820\n their actual toxicity profile, right?\n\n2:16:57.820 --> 2:16:59.500\n This made things look safer than they were\n\n2:16:59.500 --> 2:17:01.220\n and I believe a lot of profits\n\n2:17:01.220 --> 2:17:03.180\n have likely been generated downstream.\n\n2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:06.700\n So to kind of play devil's advocate,\n\n2:17:06.700 --> 2:17:10.380\n it's also possible that this particular,\n\n2:17:10.380 --> 2:17:12.500\n the length of the telomeres is not a strong variable\n\n2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:16.180\n for the drug development and for the conclusions\n\n2:17:16.180 --> 2:17:18.500\n that Carol and others have been studying.\n\n2:17:18.500 --> 2:17:21.100\n Is it possible for that to be the case?\n\n2:17:22.820 --> 2:17:27.100\n So one reason she and others could be ignoring this\n\n2:17:27.100 --> 2:17:29.500\n is because it's not a strong variable.\n\n2:17:29.500 --> 2:17:31.060\n Well, I don't believe so and in fact,\n\n2:17:31.060 --> 2:17:34.160\n at the point that I went to publish my paper,\n\n2:17:34.160 --> 2:17:36.680\n Carol published her result.\n\n2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:39.580\n She did so in a way that did not make a huge splash.\n\n2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:43.100\n Did she, I apologize if I don't know how,\n\n2:17:44.140 --> 2:17:49.140\n what was the emphasis of her publication of that paper?\n\n2:17:49.860 --> 2:17:52.220\n Was it purely just kind of showing data\n\n2:17:52.220 --> 2:17:54.140\n or is there more, because in your paper,\n\n2:17:54.140 --> 2:17:57.580\n there's a kind of more of a philosophical statement as well.\n\n2:17:57.580 --> 2:18:00.920\n Well, my paper was motivated by interest\n\n2:18:00.920 --> 2:18:03.540\n in the evolutionary dynamics around senescence.\n\n2:18:03.540 --> 2:18:07.660\n I wasn't pursuing grants or anything like that.\n\n2:18:07.660 --> 2:18:10.860\n I was just working on a puzzle I thought was interesting.\n\n2:18:10.860 --> 2:18:14.320\n Carol has, of course, gone on to win a Nobel Prize\n\n2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:17.460\n for her co discovery with Elizabeth Greider\n\n2:18:17.460 --> 2:18:20.400\n of telomerase, the enzyme that lengthens telomeres.\n\n2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.720\n But anyway, she's a heavy hitter in the academic world.\n\n2:18:25.720 --> 2:18:27.800\n I don't know exactly what her purpose was.\n\n2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.220\n I do know that she told me she wasn't planning to publish\n\n2:18:30.220 --> 2:18:32.220\n and I do know that I discovered that she was\n\n2:18:32.220 --> 2:18:34.380\n in the process of publishing very late\n\n2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:36.860\n and when I asked her to send me the paper\n\n2:18:36.860 --> 2:18:40.960\n to see whether or not she had put evidence in it\n\n2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:43.540\n that the hypothesis had come from me,\n\n2:18:43.540 --> 2:18:45.140\n she grudgingly sent it to me\n\n2:18:45.140 --> 2:18:46.700\n and my name was nowhere mentioned\n\n2:18:46.700 --> 2:18:49.580\n and she broke contact at that point.\n\n2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:53.380\n What it is that motivated her, I don't know,\n\n2:18:53.380 --> 2:18:55.020\n but I don't think it can possibly be\n\n2:18:55.020 --> 2:18:57.300\n that this result is unimportant.\n\n2:18:57.300 --> 2:19:00.580\n The fact is, the reason I called her in the first place,\n\n2:19:00.580 --> 2:19:04.820\n an established contact that generated our collaboration,\n\n2:19:04.820 --> 2:19:07.040\n was that she was a leading light in the field\n\n2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:11.020\n of telomeric studies and because of that,\n\n2:19:11.020 --> 2:19:14.060\n this question about whether the model organisms\n\n2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:18.100\n are distorting the understanding\n\n2:19:18.100 --> 2:19:20.980\n of the functioning of telomeres, it's central.\n\n2:19:20.980 --> 2:19:23.580\n Do you feel like you've been,\n\n2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:27.140\n as a young graduate student, do you think Carol\n\n2:19:27.140 --> 2:19:28.660\n or do you think the scientific community\n\n2:19:28.660 --> 2:19:31.540\n broadly screwed you over in some way?\n\n2:19:31.540 --> 2:19:33.260\n I don't think of it in those terms.\n\n2:19:33.260 --> 2:19:37.500\n Probably partly because it's not productive\n\n2:19:37.500 --> 2:19:42.360\n but I have a complex relationship with this story.\n\n2:19:42.360 --> 2:19:44.940\n On the one hand, I'm livid with Carol Greider\n\n2:19:44.940 --> 2:19:46.400\n for what she did.\n\n2:19:46.400 --> 2:19:50.060\n She absolutely pretended that I didn't exist in this story\n\n2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:51.900\n and I don't think I was a threat to her.\n\n2:19:51.900 --> 2:19:54.700\n My interest was as an evolutionary biologist,\n\n2:19:54.700 --> 2:19:57.460\n I had made an evolutionary contribution,\n\n2:19:57.460 --> 2:19:59.540\n she had tested a hypothesis and frankly,\n\n2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:01.540\n I think it would have been better for her\n\n2:20:01.540 --> 2:20:03.780\n if she had acknowledged what I had done.\n\n2:20:03.780 --> 2:20:05.900\n I think it would have enhanced her work\n\n2:20:07.020 --> 2:20:10.460\n and I was, let's put it this way,\n\n2:20:10.460 --> 2:20:12.420\n when I watched her Nobel lecture,\n\n2:20:12.420 --> 2:20:13.980\n and I should say there's been a lot of confusion\n\n2:20:13.980 --> 2:20:15.020\n about this Nobel stuff.\n\n2:20:15.020 --> 2:20:17.840\n I've never said that I should have gotten a Nobel prize.\n\n2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:20.320\n People have misportrayed that.\n\n2:20:23.180 --> 2:20:24.980\n In listening to her lecture,\n\n2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:29.100\n I had one of the most bizarre emotional experiences\n\n2:20:29.100 --> 2:20:33.140\n of my life because she presented the work\n\n2:20:33.140 --> 2:20:35.940\n that resulted from my hypothesis.\n\n2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:38.860\n She presented it as she had in her paper\n\n2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:42.300\n with no acknowledgement of where it had come from\n\n2:20:42.300 --> 2:20:47.220\n and she had in fact portrayed the distortion\n\n2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:50.620\n of the telomeres as if it were a lucky fact\n\n2:20:50.620 --> 2:20:53.180\n because it allowed testing hypotheses\n\n2:20:53.180 --> 2:20:55.600\n that would otherwise not be testable.\n\n2:20:55.600 --> 2:21:00.600\n You have to understand as a young scientist\n\n2:21:00.680 --> 2:21:04.480\n to watch work that you have done presented\n\n2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:07.680\n in what's surely the most important lecture\n\n2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:11.440\n of her career, it's thrilling.\n\n2:21:11.440 --> 2:21:16.440\n It was thrilling to see her figures\n\n2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:18.640\n projected on the screen there.\n\n2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:21.140\n To have been part of work that was important enough\n\n2:21:21.140 --> 2:21:23.160\n for that felt great and of course,\n\n2:21:23.160 --> 2:21:26.280\n to be erased from the story felt absolutely terrible.\n\n2:21:27.720 --> 2:21:30.080\n So anyway, that's sort of where I am with it.\n\n2:21:30.080 --> 2:21:35.080\n My sense is what I'm really troubled by in this story\n\n2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:40.960\n is the fact that as far as I know,\n\n2:21:41.920 --> 2:21:44.780\n the flaw with the mice has not been addressed.\n\n2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:48.020\n And actually, Eric did some looking into this.\n\n2:21:48.020 --> 2:21:50.680\n He tried to establish by calling the Jack's lab\n\n2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:54.360\n and trying to ascertain what had happened with the colonies,\n\n2:21:54.360 --> 2:21:57.000\n whether any change in protocol had occurred\n\n2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:58.720\n and he couldn't get anywhere.\n\n2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:02.280\n There was seemingly no awareness that it was even an issue.\n\n2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:06.080\n So I'm very troubled by the fact that as a father,\n\n2:22:06.080 --> 2:22:10.480\n for example, I'm in no position to protect my family\n\n2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:12.400\n from the hazard that I believe lurks\n\n2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:15.020\n in our medicine cabinets, right?\n\n2:22:15.020 --> 2:22:17.360\n Even though I'm aware of where the hazard comes from,\n\n2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:18.920\n it doesn't tell me anything useful\n\n2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:21.160\n about which of these drugs will turn out to do damage\n\n2:22:21.160 --> 2:22:23.200\n if that is ultimately tested.\n\n2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:26.500\n And that's a very frustrating position to be in.\n\n2:22:26.500 --> 2:22:28.160\n On the other hand, there's a part of me\n\n2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:31.640\n that's even still grateful to Carol for taking my call.\n\n2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:33.000\n She didn't have to take my call\n\n2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:34.640\n and talk to some young graduate student\n\n2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:36.220\n who had some evolutionary idea\n\n2:22:36.220 --> 2:22:41.220\n that wasn't in her wheelhouse specifically, and yet she did.\n\n2:22:41.320 --> 2:22:44.640\n And for a while, she was a good collaborator, so.\n\n2:22:44.640 --> 2:22:49.040\n Well, can I, I have to proceed carefully here because\n\n2:22:49.040 --> 2:22:50.640\n it's a complicated topic.\n\n2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:53.740\n So she took the call.\n\n2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:00.040\n And you kind of, you're kind of saying that\n\n2:23:01.480 --> 2:23:05.000\n she basically erased credit, you know,\n\n2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.200\n pretending you didn't exist in some kind of,\n\n2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:08.520\n in a certain sense.\n\n2:23:11.040 --> 2:23:12.440\n Let me phrase it this way.\n\n2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:17.440\n I've, as a research scientist at MIT,\n\n2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:21.400\n I've had, and especially just part of\n\n2:23:22.860 --> 2:23:25.360\n a large set of collaborations,\n\n2:23:25.360 --> 2:23:27.360\n I've had a lot of students come to me\n\n2:23:28.400 --> 2:23:31.260\n and talk to me about ideas,\n\n2:23:31.260 --> 2:23:33.600\n perhaps less interesting than what we're discussing here\n\n2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:38.360\n in the space of AI, that I've been thinking about anyway.\n\n2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:42.760\n In general, with everything I'm doing with robotics, people\n\n2:23:45.900 --> 2:23:47.660\n have told me a bunch of ideas\n\n2:23:47.660 --> 2:23:49.400\n that I'm already thinking about.\n\n2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:53.080\n The point is taking that idea, see, this is different\n\n2:23:53.080 --> 2:23:55.240\n because the idea has more power in the space\n\n2:23:55.240 --> 2:23:56.200\n that we're talking about here,\n\n2:23:56.200 --> 2:23:58.520\n and robotics is like your idea means shit\n\n2:23:58.520 --> 2:24:00.080\n until you build it.\n\n2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:03.160\n Like, so the engineering world is a little different,\n\n2:24:03.160 --> 2:24:07.980\n but there's a kind of sense that I probably forgot\n\n2:24:07.980 --> 2:24:10.380\n a lot of brilliant ideas have been told to me.\n\n2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:14.800\n Do you think she pretended you don't exist?\n\n2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:19.740\n Do you think she was so busy that she kind of forgot,\n\n2:24:19.740 --> 2:24:21.480\n you know, that she has like the stream\n\n2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:23.160\n of brilliant people around her,\n\n2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:26.240\n there's a bunch of ideas that are swimming in the air,\n\n2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:28.280\n and you just kind of forget people\n\n2:24:28.280 --> 2:24:30.280\n that are a little bit on the periphery\n\n2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:33.580\n on the idea generation, like, or is it some mix of both?\n\n2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:36.700\n It's not a mix of both.\n\n2:24:36.700 --> 2:24:39.840\n I know that because we corresponded.\n\n2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:41.840\n She put a graduate student on this work.\n\n2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:46.720\n He emailed me excitedly when the results came in.\n\n2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:50.160\n So there was no ambiguity about what had happened.\n\n2:24:50.160 --> 2:24:52.920\n What's more, when I went to publish my work,\n\n2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:56.680\n I actually sent it to Carol in order to get her feedback\n\n2:24:56.680 --> 2:24:59.800\n because I wanted to be a good collaborator to her,\n\n2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:02.760\n and she absolutely panned it,\n\n2:25:02.760 --> 2:25:06.080\n made many critiques that were not valid,\n\n2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:07.600\n but it was clear at that point\n\n2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:10.160\n that she became an antagonist,\n\n2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:12.480\n and none of this adds up.\n\n2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:15.360\n She couldn't possibly have forgotten the conversation.\n\n2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:21.560\n I believe I even sent her tissues at some point in part,\n\n2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:23.840\n not related to this project, but as a favor.\n\n2:25:23.840 --> 2:25:25.840\n She was doing another project that involved telomeres,\n\n2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:28.040\n and she needed samples that I could get ahold of\n\n2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:30.800\n because of the Museum of Zoology that I was in.\n\n2:25:30.800 --> 2:25:34.200\n So this was not a one off conversation.\n\n2:25:34.200 --> 2:25:36.160\n I certainly know that those sorts of things can happen,\n\n2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:37.840\n but that's not what happened here.\n\n2:25:37.840 --> 2:25:41.300\n This was a relationship that existed\n\n2:25:41.300 --> 2:25:43.440\n and then was suddenly cut short\n\n2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:46.360\n at the point that she published her paper by surprise\n\n2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:48.980\n without saying where the hypothesis had come from\n\n2:25:48.980 --> 2:25:53.980\n and began to be a opposing force to my work.\n\n2:25:54.900 --> 2:25:57.000\n Is there, there's a bunch of trajectories\n\n2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:58.700\n you could have taken through life.\n\n2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:03.700\n Do you think about the trajectory of being a researcher,\n\n2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:10.140\n of then going to war in the space of ideas,\n\n2:26:10.140 --> 2:26:13.560\n of publishing further papers along this line?\n\n2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:18.560\n I mean, that's often the dynamic of that fascinating space\n\n2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:21.980\n is you have a junior researcher with brilliant ideas\n\n2:26:21.980 --> 2:26:24.980\n and a senior researcher that starts out as a mentor\n\n2:26:24.980 --> 2:26:26.000\n that becomes a competitor.\n\n2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:27.800\n I mean, that happens.\n\n2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:30.460\n But then the way to,\n\n2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:33.560\n it's almost an opportunity to shine\n\n2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:36.840\n is to publish a bunch more papers in this place\n\n2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:39.280\n to tear it apart, to dig into,\n\n2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:42.600\n like really make it a war of ideas.\n\n2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:45.400\n Did you consider that possible trajectory?\n\n2:26:45.400 --> 2:26:46.840\n I did.\n\n2:26:46.840 --> 2:26:48.400\n A couple of things to say about it.\n\n2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:51.800\n One, this work was not central for me.\n\n2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:54.480\n I took a year on the T. Lemire project\n\n2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:57.600\n because something fascinating occurred to me\n\n2:26:57.600 --> 2:26:58.480\n and I pursued it.\n\n2:26:58.480 --> 2:26:59.560\n And the more I pursued it,\n\n2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.440\n the clearer it was there was something there.\n\n2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:03.800\n But it wasn't the focus of my graduate work.\n\n2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:08.680\n And I didn't want to become a T. Lemire researcher.\n\n2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:12.260\n What I want to do is to be an evolutionary biologist\n\n2:27:12.260 --> 2:27:15.900\n who upgrades the toolkit of evolutionary concepts\n\n2:27:15.900 --> 2:27:17.800\n so that we can see more clearly\n\n2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:20.180\n how organisms function and why.\n\n2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:24.880\n And T. Lemire's was a proof of concept, right?\n\n2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:26.360\n That paper was a proof of concept\n\n2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:28.260\n that the toolkit in question works.\n\n2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:35.400\n As for the need to pursue it further,\n\n2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:37.080\n I think it's kind of absurd\n\n2:27:37.080 --> 2:27:38.480\n and you're not the first person to say\n\n2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:40.060\n maybe that was the way to go about it.\n\n2:27:40.060 --> 2:27:42.540\n But the basic point is, look, the work was good.\n\n2:27:43.760 --> 2:27:47.000\n It turned out to be highly predictive.\n\n2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:50.120\n Frankly, the model of senescence that I presented\n\n2:27:50.120 --> 2:27:52.000\n is now widely accepted.\n\n2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:55.520\n And I don't feel any misgivings at all\n\n2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:58.480\n about having spent a year on it, said my piece,\n\n2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:00.040\n and moved on to other things\n\n2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:02.320\n which frankly I think are bigger.\n\n2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:03.680\n I think there's a lot of good to be done\n\n2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:08.120\n and it would be a waste to get overly narrowly focused.\n\n2:28:08.120 --> 2:28:12.920\n There's so many ways through the space of science\n\n2:28:12.920 --> 2:28:16.800\n and the most common ways is just publish a lot.\n\n2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:19.240\n Just publish a lot of papers, do these incremental work\n\n2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:24.240\n and exploring the space kind of like ants looking for food.\n\n2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:26.840\n You're tossing out a bunch of different ideas.\n\n2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:29.800\n Some of them could be brilliant breakthrough ideas, nature.\n\n2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:32.020\n Some of them are more confidence kind of publications,\n\n2:28:32.020 --> 2:28:33.360\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:37.440\n Did you consider that kind of path in science?\n\n2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:39.760\n Of course I considered it,\n\n2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:44.600\n but I must say the experience of having my first encounter\n\n2:28:44.600 --> 2:28:48.720\n with the process of peer review be this story,\n\n2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:52.460\n which was frankly a debacle from one end to the other\n\n2:28:52.460 --> 2:28:54.680\n with respect to the process of publishing.\n\n2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:58.800\n It did not, it was not a very good sales pitch\n\n2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:01.480\n for trying to make a difference through publication.\n\n2:29:01.480 --> 2:29:03.320\n And I would point out part of what I ran into\n\n2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:06.920\n and I think frankly part of what explains Carol's behavior\n\n2:29:06.920 --> 2:29:10.640\n is that in some parts of science,\n\n2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:15.640\n there is this dynamic where PIs parasitize their underlings\n\n2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:20.320\n and if you're very, very good, you rise to the level\n\n2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:23.160\n where one day instead of being parasitized,\n\n2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:25.320\n you get to parasitize others.\n\n2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:27.520\n Now I find that scientifically despicable\n\n2:29:28.360 --> 2:29:31.220\n and it wasn't the culture of the lab I grew up in at all.\n\n2:29:31.220 --> 2:29:35.840\n My lab, in fact, the PI, Dick Alexander, who's now gone,\n\n2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:40.400\n but who was an incredible mind and a great human being,\n\n2:29:40.400 --> 2:29:42.520\n he didn't want his graduate students working\n\n2:29:42.520 --> 2:29:44.280\n on the same topics he was on,\n\n2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:47.480\n not because it wouldn't have been useful and exciting,\n\n2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:51.240\n but because in effect, he did not want any confusion\n\n2:29:51.240 --> 2:29:55.640\n about who had done what because he was a great mentor\n\n2:29:55.640 --> 2:29:58.600\n and the idea was actually a great mentor\n\n2:29:58.600 --> 2:30:02.360\n is not stealing ideas and you don't want people\n\n2:30:02.360 --> 2:30:03.500\n thinking that they are.\n\n2:30:03.500 --> 2:30:05.940\n So anyway, my point would be,\n\n2:30:08.120 --> 2:30:11.200\n I wasn't up for being parasitized.\n\n2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:14.440\n I don't like the idea that if you are very good,\n\n2:30:14.440 --> 2:30:16.300\n you get parasitized until it's your turn\n\n2:30:16.300 --> 2:30:17.700\n to parasitize others.\n\n2:30:17.700 --> 2:30:19.200\n That doesn't make sense to me.\n\n2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:23.680\n Crossing over from evolution into cellular biology\n\n2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:25.440\n may have exposed me to that.\n\n2:30:25.440 --> 2:30:26.960\n That may have been par for the course,\n\n2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:29.800\n but it doesn't make it acceptable.\n\n2:30:29.800 --> 2:30:33.120\n And I would also point out that my work falls\n\n2:30:33.120 --> 2:30:35.500\n in the realm of synthesis.\n\n2:30:36.500 --> 2:30:41.500\n My work generally takes evidence accumulated by others\n\n2:30:41.500 --> 2:30:46.420\n and places it together in order to generate hypotheses\n\n2:30:46.420 --> 2:30:48.660\n that explain sets of phenomena\n\n2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:51.300\n that are otherwise intractable.\n\n2:30:51.300 --> 2:30:55.260\n And I am not sure that that is best done\n\n2:30:55.260 --> 2:30:59.700\n with narrow publications that are read by few.\n\n2:30:59.700 --> 2:31:03.020\n And in fact, I would point to the very conspicuous example\n\n2:31:03.020 --> 2:31:05.160\n of Richard Dawkins, who I must say I've learned\n\n2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:07.940\n a tremendous amount from and I greatly admire.\n\n2:31:07.940 --> 2:31:12.240\n Dawkins has almost no publication record\n\n2:31:12.240 --> 2:31:15.720\n in the sense of peer reviewed papers in journals.\n\n2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:18.160\n What he's done instead is done synthetic work\n\n2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:19.580\n and he's published it in books,\n\n2:31:19.580 --> 2:31:22.520\n which are not peer reviewed in the same sense.\n\n2:31:22.520 --> 2:31:24.820\n And frankly, I think there's no doubting\n\n2:31:24.820 --> 2:31:27.040\n his contribution to the field.\n\n2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:32.040\n So my sense is if Richard Dawkins can illustrate\n\n2:31:32.240 --> 2:31:34.380\n that one can make contributions to the field\n\n2:31:34.380 --> 2:31:38.340\n without using journals as the primary mechanism\n\n2:31:38.340 --> 2:31:40.560\n for distributing what you've come to understand,\n\n2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:42.360\n then it's obviously a valid mechanism\n\n2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:44.640\n and it's a far better one from the point of view\n\n2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:46.380\n of accomplishing what I want to accomplish.\n\n2:31:46.380 --> 2:31:47.880\n Yeah, it's really interesting.\n\n2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:49.200\n There is of course several levels\n\n2:31:49.200 --> 2:31:50.800\n you can do the kind of synthesis\n\n2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:53.940\n and that does require a lot of both broad\n\n2:31:53.940 --> 2:31:56.180\n and deep thinking is exceptionally valuable.\n\n2:31:56.180 --> 2:31:58.880\n You could also, I'm working on something\n\n2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:02.280\n with Andrew Huberman now, you can also publish synthesis.\n\n2:32:02.280 --> 2:32:05.680\n That's like review papers that are exceptionally valuable\n\n2:32:05.680 --> 2:32:06.720\n for the communities.\n\n2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:09.400\n It brings the community together, tells a history,\n\n2:32:09.400 --> 2:32:11.120\n tells a story of where the community has been.\n\n2:32:11.120 --> 2:32:14.440\n It paints a picture of where the path lays for the future.\n\n2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:15.600\n I think it's really valuable.\n\n2:32:15.600 --> 2:32:17.440\n And Richard Dawkins is a good example\n\n2:32:17.440 --> 2:32:19.280\n of somebody that does that in book form\n\n2:32:20.280 --> 2:32:23.680\n that he kind of walks the line really interestingly.\n\n2:32:23.680 --> 2:32:26.440\n You have like somebody who like Neil deGrasse Tyson,\n\n2:32:26.440 --> 2:32:28.800\n who's more like a science communicator.\n\n2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:31.000\n Richard Dawkins sometimes is a science communicator,\n\n2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:34.000\n but he gets like close to the technical\n\n2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:36.960\n to where it's a little bit, it's not shying away\n\n2:32:36.960 --> 2:32:41.440\n from being really a contribution to science.\n\n2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:44.140\n No, he's made real contributions.\n\n2:32:44.140 --> 2:32:45.040\n In book form.\n\n2:32:45.040 --> 2:32:46.600\n Yes, he really has.\n\n2:32:46.600 --> 2:32:47.600\n Which is fascinating.\n\n2:32:47.600 --> 2:32:51.640\n I mean, Roger Penrose, I mean, similar kind of idea.\n\n2:32:51.640 --> 2:32:53.060\n That's interesting, that's interesting.\n\n2:32:53.060 --> 2:32:56.480\n Synthesis does not, especially synthesis work,\n\n2:32:56.480 --> 2:33:00.440\n work that synthesizes ideas does not necessarily need\n\n2:33:00.440 --> 2:33:01.680\n to be peer reviewed.\n\n2:33:03.280 --> 2:33:08.240\n It's peer reviewed by peers reading it.\n\n2:33:08.240 --> 2:33:10.160\n Well, and reviewing it.\n\n2:33:10.160 --> 2:33:11.720\n That's it, it is reviewed by peers,\n\n2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:13.500\n which is not synonymous with peer review.\n\n2:33:13.500 --> 2:33:15.600\n And that's the thing is people don't understand\n\n2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:17.740\n that the two things aren't the same, right?\n\n2:33:17.740 --> 2:33:20.240\n Peer review is an anonymous process\n\n2:33:20.240 --> 2:33:23.360\n that happens before publication\n\n2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:26.620\n in a place where there is a power dynamic, right?\n\n2:33:26.620 --> 2:33:28.280\n I mean, the joke of course is that peer review\n\n2:33:28.280 --> 2:33:30.360\n is actually peer preview, right?\n\n2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:32.880\n Your biggest competitors get to see your work\n\n2:33:32.880 --> 2:33:34.160\n before it sees the light of day\n\n2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:37.260\n and decide whether or not it gets published.\n\n2:33:37.260 --> 2:33:41.240\n And again, when your formative experience\n\n2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:43.520\n with the publication apparatus is the one I had\n\n2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:46.880\n with the telomere paper, there's no way\n\n2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:48.300\n that that seems like the right way\n\n2:33:48.300 --> 2:33:50.720\n to advance important ideas.\n\n2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:54.000\n And what's the harm in publishing them\n\n2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:55.900\n so that your peers have to review them in public\n\n2:33:55.900 --> 2:33:58.600\n where they actually, if they're gonna disagree with you,\n\n2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:00.580\n they actually have to take the risk of saying,\n\n2:34:00.580 --> 2:34:03.380\n I don't think this is right and here's why, right?\n\n2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:04.520\n With their name on it.\n\n2:34:04.520 --> 2:34:05.540\n I'd much rather that.\n\n2:34:05.540 --> 2:34:07.600\n It's not that I don't want my work reviewed by peers,\n\n2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:10.220\n but I want it done in the open, you know,\n\n2:34:10.220 --> 2:34:11.480\n for the same reason you don't meet\n\n2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:14.640\n with dangerous people in private, you meet at the cafe.\n\n2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:17.600\n I want the work reviewed out in public.\n\n2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:20.840\n Can I ask you a difficult question?\n\n2:34:20.840 --> 2:34:21.680\n Sure.\n\n2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:26.640\n There is popularity in martyrdom.\n\n2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:30.580\n There's popularity in pointing out\n\n2:34:30.580 --> 2:34:32.140\n that the emperor has no clothes.\n\n2:34:33.740 --> 2:34:36.140\n That can become a drug in itself.\n\n2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:45.380\n I've confronted this in scientific work I've done at MIT\n\n2:34:46.860 --> 2:34:49.900\n where there are certain things that are not done well.\n\n2:34:49.900 --> 2:34:52.500\n People are not being the best version of themselves.\n\n2:34:52.500 --> 2:34:57.500\n And particular aspects of a particular field\n\n2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:02.280\n are in need of a revolution.\n\n2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:06.280\n And part of me wanted to point that out\n\n2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:11.280\n versus doing the hard work of publishing papers\n\n2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:13.240\n and doing the revolution.\n\n2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:15.040\n Basically just pointing out, look,\n\n2:35:15.920 --> 2:35:19.320\n you guys are doing it wrong and then just walking away.\n\n2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:23.360\n Are you aware of the drug of martyrdom,\n\n2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:28.360\n of the ego involved in it,\n\n2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:31.500\n that it can cloud your thinking?\n\n2:35:32.700 --> 2:35:35.840\n Probably one of the best questions I've ever been asked.\n\n2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:38.300\n So let me try to sort it out.\n\n2:35:39.360 --> 2:35:43.560\n First of all, we are all mysteries to ourself at some level.\n\n2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:46.240\n So it's possible there's stuff going on in me\n\n2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:48.320\n that I'm not aware of that's driving.\n\n2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:52.080\n But in general, I would say one of my better strengths\n\n2:35:52.080 --> 2:35:54.280\n is that I'm not especially ego driven.\n\n2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:58.540\n I have an ego, I clearly think highly of myself,\n\n2:35:58.540 --> 2:36:00.300\n but it is not driving me.\n\n2:36:00.300 --> 2:36:03.220\n I do not crave that kind of validation.\n\n2:36:03.220 --> 2:36:05.000\n I do crave certain things.\n\n2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.880\n I do love a good eureka moment.\n\n2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:09.360\n There is something great about it.\n\n2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:11.720\n And there's something even better about the phone calls\n\n2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:14.280\n you make next when you share it, right?\n\n2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:15.840\n It's pretty fun, right?\n\n2:36:15.840 --> 2:36:17.380\n I really like it.\n\n2:36:17.380 --> 2:36:20.880\n I also really like my subject, right?\n\n2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:23.800\n There's something about a walk in the forest\n\n2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:26.920\n when you have a toolkit in which you can actually look\n\n2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:30.740\n at creatures and see something deep, right?\n\n2:36:30.740 --> 2:36:33.060\n I like it, that drives me.\n\n2:36:33.060 --> 2:36:35.880\n And I could entertain myself for the rest of my life, right?\n\n2:36:35.880 --> 2:36:39.800\n If I was somehow isolated from the rest of the world,\n\n2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:42.920\n but I was in a place that was biologically interesting,\n\n2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:45.960\n hopefully I would be with people that I love\n\n2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:48.360\n and pets that I love, believe it or not.\n\n2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:51.600\n But if I were in that situation and I could just go out\n\n2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:54.000\n every day and look at cool stuff and figure out\n\n2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.680\n what it means, I could be all right with that.\n\n2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:01.680\n So I'm not heavily driven by the ego thing, as you put it.\n\n2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:07.440\n So I am completely the same except instead of the pets,\n\n2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:08.520\n I would put robots.\n\n2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:12.000\n But so it's not, it's the eureka, it's the exploration\n\n2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:16.040\n of the subject that brings you joy and fulfillment.\n\n2:37:16.040 --> 2:37:17.840\n It's not the ego.\n\n2:37:17.840 --> 2:37:18.880\n Well, there's more to say.\n\n2:37:18.880 --> 2:37:21.480\n No, I really don't think it's the ego thing.\n\n2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:24.200\n I will say I also have kind of a secondary passion\n\n2:37:24.200 --> 2:37:25.140\n for robot stuff.\n\n2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:29.000\n I've never made anything useful, but I do believe,\n\n2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.640\n I believe I found my calling.\n\n2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:32.320\n But if this wasn't my calling,\n\n2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:34.460\n my calling would have been inventing stuff.\n\n2:37:34.460 --> 2:37:36.120\n I really enjoy that too.\n\n2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:39.920\n So I get what you're saying about the analogy quite well.\n\n2:37:39.920 --> 2:37:43.080\n But as far as the martyrdom thing,\n\n2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:47.920\n I understand the drug you're talking about\n\n2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:51.000\n and I've seen it more than I've felt it.\n\n2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:53.760\n I do, if I'm just to be completely candid\n\n2:37:53.760 --> 2:37:57.640\n and this question is so good, it deserves a candid answer.\n\n2:37:57.640 --> 2:38:01.960\n I do like the fight, right?\n\n2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:04.720\n I like fighting against people I don't respect\n\n2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:09.720\n and I like winning, but I have no interest in martyrdom.\n\n2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.680\n One of the reasons I have no interest in martyrdom\n\n2:38:12.680 --> 2:38:15.300\n is that I'm having too good a time, right?\n\n2:38:15.300 --> 2:38:17.560\n I very much enjoy my life and.\n\n2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:18.760\n It's such a good answer.\n\n2:38:18.760 --> 2:38:21.240\n I have a wonderful wife.\n\n2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:23.420\n I have amazing children.\n\n2:38:23.420 --> 2:38:26.040\n I live in a lovely place.\n\n2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:29.440\n I don't wanna exit any quicker than I have to.\n\n2:38:29.440 --> 2:38:32.240\n That said, I also believe in things\n\n2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:35.600\n and a willingness to exit if that's the only way\n\n2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:37.840\n is not exactly inviting martyrdom,\n\n2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:41.260\n but it is an acceptance that fighting is dangerous\n\n2:38:41.260 --> 2:38:43.720\n and going up against powerful forces\n\n2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:46.040\n means who knows what will come of it, right?\n\n2:38:46.040 --> 2:38:48.840\n I don't have the sense that the thing is out there\n\n2:38:48.840 --> 2:38:51.440\n that used to kill inconvenient people.\n\n2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:52.880\n I don't think that's how it's done anymore.\n\n2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:56.880\n It's primarily done through destroying them reputationally,\n\n2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:00.520\n which is not something I relish the possibility of,\n\n2:39:00.520 --> 2:39:03.440\n but there is a difference between\n\n2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:07.800\n a willingness to face the hazard\n\n2:39:07.800 --> 2:39:12.800\n rather than a desire to face it because of the thrill, right?\n\n2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:18.560\n For me, the thrill is in fighting when I'm in the right.\n\n2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:22.320\n I think I feel that that is a worthwhile way\n\n2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:27.320\n to take what I see as the kind of brutality\n\n2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:30.560\n that is built into men and to channel it\n\n2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:33.520\n to something useful, right?\n\n2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:35.240\n If it is not channeled into something useful,\n\n2:39:35.240 --> 2:39:36.520\n it will be channeled into something else,\n\n2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:38.880\n so it damn well better be channeled into something useful.\n\n2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:41.040\n It's not motivated by fame or popularity,\n\n2:39:41.040 --> 2:39:42.040\n those kinds of things.\n\n2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:45.840\n It's, you know what, you're just making me realize\n\n2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:47.760\n that enjoying the fight,\n\n2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:53.240\n fighting the powerful and idea that you believe is right\n\n2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:58.240\n is a kind of optimism for the human spirit.\n\n2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:04.360\n It's like, we can win this.\n\n2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:08.000\n It's almost like you're turning into action,\n\n2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:13.000\n into personal action, this hope for humanity\n\n2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:15.720\n by saying like, we can win this.\n\n2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:20.720\n And that makes you feel good about the rest of humanity,\n\n2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:25.720\n that if there's people like me, then we're going to be okay.\n\n2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.480\n Even if you're like, your ideas might be wrong or not,\n\n2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:31.520\n but if you believe they're right\n\n2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:36.080\n and you're fighting the powerful against all odds,\n\n2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:37.640\n then we're going to be okay.\n\n2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:42.480\n If I were to project, I mean,\n\n2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:44.320\n because I enjoy the fight as well,\n\n2:40:44.320 --> 2:40:48.080\n I think that's the way I, that's what brings me joy,\n\n2:40:48.080 --> 2:40:53.080\n is it's almost like it's optimism in action.\n\n2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:55.600\n Well, it's a little different for me.\n\n2:40:55.600 --> 2:40:58.440\n And again, I think, you know, I recognize you.\n\n2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:01.000\n You're a familiar, your construction is familiar,\n\n2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:02.600\n even if it isn't mine, right?\n\n2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:08.320\n For me, I actually expect us not to be okay.\n\n2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:10.160\n And I'm not okay with that.\n\n2:41:10.160 --> 2:41:14.400\n But what's really important, if I feel like what I've said\n\n2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:17.320\n is I don't know of any reason that it's not okay,\n\n2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:19.720\n or any reason that it's too late.\n\n2:41:19.720 --> 2:41:22.560\n As far as I know, we could still save humanity\n\n2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:24.040\n and we could get to the fourth frontier\n\n2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:26.280\n or something akin to it.\n\n2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:29.960\n But I expect us not to, I expect us to fuck it up, right?\n\n2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:32.360\n I don't like that thought, but I've looked into the abyss\n\n2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:34.480\n and I've done my calculations\n\n2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:38.920\n and the number of ways we could not succeed are many\n\n2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:40.920\n and the number of ways that we could manage\n\n2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:44.040\n to get out of this very dangerous phase of history is small.\n\n2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:47.440\n The thing I don't have to worry about is\n\n2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:50.520\n that I didn't do enough, right?\n\n2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.520\n That I was a coward, that I prioritized other things.\n\n2:41:57.160 --> 2:41:59.240\n At the end of the day, I think I will be able to say\n\n2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:02.120\n to myself, and in fact, the thing that allows me to sleep,\n\n2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:05.600\n is that when I saw clearly what needed to be done,\n\n2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:08.400\n I tried to do it to the extent that it was in my power.\n\n2:42:08.400 --> 2:42:12.720\n And if we fail, as I expect us to,\n\n2:42:12.720 --> 2:42:16.160\n I can't say, well, geez, that's on me, you know?\n\n2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:18.400\n And frankly, I regard what I just said to you\n\n2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.160\n as something like a personality defect, right?\n\n2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:24.240\n I'm trying to free myself from the sense\n\n2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:25.760\n that this is my fault.\n\n2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:28.160\n On the other hand, my guess is that personality defect\n\n2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:31.320\n is probably good for humanity, right?\n\n2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:34.880\n It's a good one for me to have the externalities\n\n2:42:34.880 --> 2:42:38.640\n of it are positive, so I don't feel too bad about it.\n\n2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:42.920\n Yeah, that's funny, so yeah, our perspective on the world\n\n2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:45.160\n are different, but they rhyme, like you said.\n\n2:42:45.160 --> 2:42:47.600\n Because I've also looked into the abyss,\n\n2:42:47.600 --> 2:42:51.640\n and it kind of smiled nervously back.\n\n2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:55.720\n So I have a more optimistic sense that we're gonna win\n\n2:42:55.720 --> 2:42:58.080\n more than likely we're going to be okay.\n\n2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:00.160\n Right there with you, brother.\n\n2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:01.560\n I'm hoping you're right.\n\n2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:03.720\n I'm expecting me to be right.\n\n2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:07.280\n But back to Eric, you had a wonderful conversation.\n\n2:43:07.280 --> 2:43:11.080\n In that conversation, he played the big brother role,\n\n2:43:11.080 --> 2:43:13.280\n and he was very happy about it.\n\n2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:15.480\n He was self congratulatory about it.\n\n2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:21.280\n Can you talk to the ways in which Eric made you\n\n2:43:21.280 --> 2:43:24.040\n a better man throughout your life?\n\n2:43:24.040 --> 2:43:25.600\n Yeah, hell yeah.\n\n2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:27.920\n I mean, for one thing, you know,\n\n2:43:27.920 --> 2:43:30.960\n Eric and I are interestingly similar in some ways\n\n2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:33.080\n and radically different in some other ways,\n\n2:43:33.080 --> 2:43:35.760\n and it's often a matter of fascination\n\n2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:38.000\n to people who know us both because almost always\n\n2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.040\n people meet one of us first, and they sort of\n\n2:43:40.040 --> 2:43:41.800\n get used to that thing, and then they meet the other,\n\n2:43:41.800 --> 2:43:44.400\n and it throws the model into chaos.\n\n2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:47.080\n But you know, I had a great advantage,\n\n2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:49.440\n which is I came second, right?\n\n2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:51.800\n So although it was kind of a pain in the ass\n\n2:43:51.800 --> 2:43:53.760\n to be born into a world that had Eric in it\n\n2:43:53.760 --> 2:43:55.920\n because he's a force of nature, right?\n\n2:43:55.920 --> 2:43:59.520\n It was also terrifically useful because A,\n\n2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:02.640\n he was a very awesome older brother\n\n2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:06.000\n who made interesting mistakes, learned from them,\n\n2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:08.760\n and conveyed the wisdom of what he had discovered,\n\n2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:12.640\n and that was, you know, I don't know who else\n\n2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:16.120\n ends up so lucky as to have that kind of person\n\n2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:18.000\n blazing the trail.\n\n2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:22.520\n It also probably, you know, my hypothesis\n\n2:44:22.520 --> 2:44:24.840\n for what birth order effects are\n\n2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:27.960\n is that they're actually adaptive, right?\n\n2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:30.680\n That the reason that a second born is different\n\n2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:32.840\n than a first born is that they're not born\n\n2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:35.560\n into a world with the same niches in it, right?\n\n2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:38.240\n And so the thing about Eric is he's been\n\n2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:43.240\n completely dominant in the realm of fundamental thinking,\n\n2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:45.800\n right, like what he's fascinated by\n\n2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:48.400\n is the fundamental of fundamentals,\n\n2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:50.520\n and he's excellent at it, which meant\n\n2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:52.080\n that I was born into a world where somebody\n\n2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:54.320\n was becoming excellent in that, and for me\n\n2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:57.160\n to be anywhere near the fundamental of fundamentals\n\n2:44:57.160 --> 2:44:58.760\n was going to be pointless, right?\n\n2:44:58.760 --> 2:45:00.880\n I was going to be playing second fiddle forever,\n\n2:45:00.880 --> 2:45:02.520\n and I think that that actually drove me\n\n2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:04.640\n to the other end of the continuum\n\n2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:06.560\n between fundamental and emergent,\n\n2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:09.120\n and so I became fascinated with biology\n\n2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:13.480\n and have been since I was three years old, right?\n\n2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:16.920\n I think Eric drove that, and I have to thank him for it\n\n2:45:16.920 --> 2:45:19.280\n because, you know, I mean.\n\n2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:24.040\n I never thought of, so Eric drives towards the fundamental,\n\n2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:26.360\n and you drive towards the emergent,\n\n2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:28.160\n the physics and the biology.\n\n2:45:28.160 --> 2:45:30.040\n Right, opposite ends of the continuum,\n\n2:45:30.040 --> 2:45:32.600\n and as Eric would be quick to point out\n\n2:45:32.600 --> 2:45:36.120\n if he was sitting here, I treat the emergent layer,\n\n2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:37.720\n I seek the fundamentals in it,\n\n2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:40.320\n which is sort of an echo of Eric's style of thinking\n\n2:45:40.320 --> 2:45:43.440\n but applied to the very far complexity.\n\n2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:48.440\n He's overpoweringly argues for the importance of physics,\n\n2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:52.120\n the fundamental of the fundamental.\n\n2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:57.360\n He's not here to defend himself.\n\n2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:00.200\n Is there an argument to be made against that?\n\n2:46:00.200 --> 2:46:03.040\n Or biology, the emergent,\n\n2:46:03.040 --> 2:46:06.800\n the study of the thing that emerged\n\n2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:10.800\n when the fundamental acts at the cosmic scale\n\n2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:13.200\n and then builds the beautiful thing that is us\n\n2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:14.400\n is much more important.\n\n2:46:16.160 --> 2:46:19.840\n Psychology, biology, the systems\n\n2:46:19.840 --> 2:46:23.440\n that we're actually interacting with in this human world\n\n2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:25.440\n are much more important to understand\n\n2:46:25.440 --> 2:46:30.440\n than the low level theories of quantum mechanics\n\n2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:33.760\n and general relativity.\n\n2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:35.720\n Yeah, I can't say that one is more important.\n\n2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:38.400\n I think there's probably a different time scale.\n\n2:46:38.400 --> 2:46:40.760\n I think understanding the emergent layer\n\n2:46:40.760 --> 2:46:44.880\n is more often useful, but the bang for the buck\n\n2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:48.400\n at the far fundamental layer may be much greater.\n\n2:46:48.400 --> 2:46:51.240\n So for example, the fourth frontier,\n\n2:46:51.240 --> 2:46:55.640\n I'm pretty sure it's gonna have to be fusion powered.\n\n2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:57.200\n I don't think anything else will do it,\n\n2:46:57.200 --> 2:46:58.800\n but once you had fusion power,\n\n2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:01.400\n assuming we didn't just dump fusion power on the market\n\n2:47:01.400 --> 2:47:02.600\n the way we would be likely to\n\n2:47:02.600 --> 2:47:05.680\n if it was invented usefully tomorrow,\n\n2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:08.520\n but if we had fusion power\n\n2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:10.920\n and we had a little bit more wisdom than we have,\n\n2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:12.000\n you could do an awful lot.\n\n2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:15.360\n And that's not gonna come from people like me\n\n2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:17.960\n who look at the dynamics of it.\n\n2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:19.400\n Can I argue against that?\n\n2:47:19.400 --> 2:47:21.240\n Please.\n\n2:47:21.240 --> 2:47:25.680\n I think the way to unlock fusion power\n\n2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:27.520\n is through artificial intelligence.\n\n2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:32.560\n So I think most of the breakthrough ideas\n\n2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:35.960\n in the futures of science will be developed by AI systems.\n\n2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:38.960\n And I think in order to build intelligent AI systems,\n\n2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:41.440\n you have to be a scholar of the fundamental\n\n2:47:41.440 --> 2:47:46.440\n of the emergent, of biology, of the neuroscience,\n\n2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:48.960\n of the way the brain works,\n\n2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:50.960\n of intelligence, of consciousness.\n\n2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:53.800\n And those things, at least directly,\n\n2:47:53.800 --> 2:47:56.120\n don't have anything to do with physics.\n\n2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:56.960\n Well.\n\n2:47:56.960 --> 2:47:58.240\n You're making me a little bit sad\n\n2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:02.080\n because my addiction to the aha moment thing\n\n2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:06.760\n is incompatible with outsourcing that job.\n\n2:48:06.760 --> 2:48:07.600\n Like the outsource thing.\n\n2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:09.280\n I don't wanna outsource that thing to the AI.\n\n2:48:09.280 --> 2:48:11.520\n You reap the moment.\n\n2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:13.240\n And actually, I've seen this happen before\n\n2:48:13.240 --> 2:48:16.400\n because some of the people who trained Heather and me\n\n2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:19.360\n were phylogenetic systematists,\n\n2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:21.720\n Arnold Kluge in particular.\n\n2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:24.920\n And the problem with systematics\n\n2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:28.760\n is that to do it right when your technology is primitive,\n\n2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:32.000\n you have to be deeply embedded in the philosophical\n\n2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:33.960\n and the logical, right?\n\n2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:38.960\n Your method has to be based in the highest level of rigor.\n\n2:48:40.200 --> 2:48:42.360\n Once you can sequence genes,\n\n2:48:42.360 --> 2:48:44.120\n genes can spit so much data at you\n\n2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:46.800\n that you can overwhelm high quality work\n\n2:48:46.800 --> 2:48:49.960\n with just lots and lots and lots of automated work.\n\n2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:51.760\n And so in some sense,\n\n2:48:51.760 --> 2:48:54.960\n there's like a generation of phylogenetic systematists\n\n2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:56.640\n who are the last of the greats\n\n2:48:56.640 --> 2:48:58.880\n because what's replacing them is sequencers.\n\n2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:03.120\n So anyway, maybe you're right about the AI.\n\n2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:03.960\n And I guess I'm...\n\n2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:04.800\n What makes you sad?\n\n2:49:06.200 --> 2:49:07.960\n I like figuring stuff out.\n\n2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:11.240\n Is there something that you disagree with the error con,\n\n2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:14.840\n even trying to convince them you failed so far,\n\n2:49:14.840 --> 2:49:17.720\n but you will eventually succeed?\n\n2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:20.600\n You know, that is a very long list.\n\n2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.120\n Eric and I have tensions over certain things\n\n2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:26.960\n that recur all the time.\n\n2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:29.760\n And I'm trying to think what would be the ideal...\n\n2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:30.840\n Is it in the space of science,\n\n2:49:30.840 --> 2:49:35.840\n in the space of philosophy, politics, family, love, robots?\n\n2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:39.760\n Well, all right, let me...\n\n2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:42.480\n I'm just gonna use your podcast\n\n2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:44.760\n to make a bit of a cryptic war\n\n2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:47.120\n and just say there are many places\n\n2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:50.720\n in which I believe that I have butted heads with Eric\n\n2:49:50.720 --> 2:49:52.360\n over the course of decades\n\n2:49:52.360 --> 2:49:55.040\n and I have seen him move in my direction\n\n2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:56.320\n substantially over time.\n\n2:49:56.320 --> 2:49:57.560\n So you've been winning.\n\n2:49:57.560 --> 2:49:59.480\n He might win a battle here or there,\n\n2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:00.600\n but you've been winning the war.\n\n2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:01.840\n I would not say that.\n\n2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:04.800\n It's quite possible he could say the same thing about me.\n\n2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:06.240\n And in fact, I know that it's true.\n\n2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:08.440\n There are places where he's absolutely convinced me.\n\n2:50:08.440 --> 2:50:11.880\n But in any case, I do believe it's at least...\n\n2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:13.240\n It may not be a totally even fight,\n\n2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:15.360\n but it's more even than some will imagine.\n\n2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:17.600\n But yeah, we have...\n\n2:50:18.920 --> 2:50:22.680\n There are things I say that drive him nuts, right?\n\n2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:27.280\n Like when something, like you heard me talk about the...\n\n2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:29.560\n What was it?\n\n2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:33.880\n It was the autopilot that seems to be putting\n\n2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:37.240\n a great many humans in needless medical jeopardy\n\n2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:40.360\n over the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\n2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:44.480\n And my feeling is we can say this almost for sure.\n\n2:50:45.520 --> 2:50:47.080\n Anytime you have the appearance\n\n2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:50.720\n of some captured gigantic entity\n\n2:50:50.720 --> 2:50:52.960\n that is censoring you on YouTube\n\n2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:56.840\n and handing down dictates from the who and all of that,\n\n2:50:56.840 --> 2:50:59.240\n it is sure that there will be\n\n2:50:59.240 --> 2:51:01.360\n a certain amount of collusion, right?\n\n2:51:01.360 --> 2:51:04.000\n There's gonna be some embarrassing emails in some places\n\n2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:05.880\n that are gonna reveal some shocking connections.\n\n2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:09.520\n And then there's gonna be an awful lot of emergence\n\n2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:11.400\n that didn't involve collusion, right?\n\n2:51:11.400 --> 2:51:13.480\n In which people were doing their little part of a job\n\n2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:14.480\n and something was emerging.\n\n2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:16.800\n And you never know what the admixture is.\n\n2:51:16.800 --> 2:51:19.600\n How much are we looking at actual collusion\n\n2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:21.560\n and how much are we looking at an emergent process?\n\n2:51:21.560 --> 2:51:23.600\n But you should always walk in with the sense\n\n2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:24.840\n that it's gonna be a ratio.\n\n2:51:24.840 --> 2:51:27.680\n And the question is, what is the ratio in this case?\n\n2:51:27.680 --> 2:51:29.840\n I think this drives Eric nuts\n\n2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:32.480\n because he is very focused on the people.\n\n2:51:32.480 --> 2:51:34.960\n I think he's focused on the people who have a choice\n\n2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:36.880\n and make the wrong one.\n\n2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:38.600\n And anyway, he may.\n\n2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:41.320\n Discussion of the ratio is a distraction to that.\n\n2:51:41.320 --> 2:51:45.000\n I think he takes it almost as an offense\n\n2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:50.000\n because it grants cover to people who are harming others.\n\n2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:56.120\n And I think it offends him morally.\n\n2:51:56.120 --> 2:52:00.280\n And if I had to say, I would say it alters his judgment\n\n2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:01.120\n on the matter.\n\n2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:05.280\n But anyway, certainly useful just to leave open\n\n2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:07.280\n the two possibilities and say it's a ratio,\n\n2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:08.680\n but we don't know which one.\n\n2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:13.280\n Brother to brother, do you love the guy?\n\n2:52:13.280 --> 2:52:15.480\n Hmm, hell yeah, hell yeah.\n\n2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:18.200\n And I'd love him if he was just my brother,\n\n2:52:18.200 --> 2:52:19.240\n but he's also awesome.\n\n2:52:19.240 --> 2:52:21.960\n So I love him and I love him for who he is.\n\n2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:25.920\n So let me ask you about back to your book,\n\n2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:29.680\n Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century.\n\n2:52:29.680 --> 2:52:32.480\n I can't wait both for the book and the videos\n\n2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:33.720\n you do on the book.\n\n2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:35.880\n That's really exciting that there's like a structured,\n\n2:52:35.880 --> 2:52:37.680\n organized way to present this.\n\n2:52:39.760 --> 2:52:44.640\n A kind of from an evolutionary biology perspective,\n\n2:52:44.640 --> 2:52:46.680\n a guide for the future,\n\n2:52:46.680 --> 2:52:51.680\n using our past as the fundamental, the emergent way\n\n2:52:52.360 --> 2:52:54.760\n to present a picture of the future.\n\n2:52:56.160 --> 2:52:59.160\n Let me ask you about something that,\n\n2:53:00.880 --> 2:53:02.720\n I think about a little bit in this modern world,\n\n2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:03.800\n which is monogamy.\n\n2:53:07.600 --> 2:53:10.200\n So I personally value monogamy.\n\n2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:12.440\n One girl, ride or die.\n\n2:53:12.440 --> 2:53:13.560\n There you go.\n\n2:53:13.560 --> 2:53:15.480\n Ride or, no, that's exactly it now.\n\n2:53:15.480 --> 2:53:20.480\n But that said, I don't know what's the right way\n\n2:53:21.720 --> 2:53:23.120\n to approach this,\n\n2:53:23.120 --> 2:53:27.200\n but from an evolutionary biology perspective\n\n2:53:27.200 --> 2:53:30.120\n or from just looking at modern society,\n\n2:53:30.120 --> 2:53:32.520\n that seems to be an idea that's not,\n\n2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:35.840\n what's the right way to put it, flourishing?\n\n2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:38.400\n It is waning.\n\n2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:39.240\n It's waning.\n\n2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:44.120\n So I suppose based on your reaction,\n\n2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:45.880\n you're also a supporter of monogamy\n\n2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:47.920\n or you value monogamy.\n\n2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:51.160\n Are you and I just delusional?\n\n2:53:53.720 --> 2:53:56.400\n What can you say about monogamy\n\n2:53:56.400 --> 2:53:58.280\n from the context of your book,\n\n2:53:58.280 --> 2:54:00.640\n from the context of evolutionary biology,\n\n2:54:00.640 --> 2:54:02.560\n from the context of being human?\n\n2:54:02.560 --> 2:54:05.040\n Yeah, I can say that I fully believe\n\n2:54:05.040 --> 2:54:06.600\n that we are actually enlightened\n\n2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:09.360\n and that although monogamy is waning,\n\n2:54:09.360 --> 2:54:12.320\n that it is not waning because there is a superior system.\n\n2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:15.400\n It is waning for predictable other reasons.\n\n2:54:15.400 --> 2:54:18.480\n So let us just say it is,\n\n2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:21.920\n there is a lot of pre trans fallacy here\n\n2:54:21.920 --> 2:54:24.880\n where people go through a phase\n\n2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:26.760\n where they recognize that actually\n\n2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:31.760\n we know a lot about the evolution of monogamy\n\n2:54:31.840 --> 2:54:33.480\n and we can tell from the fact\n\n2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:36.720\n that humans are somewhat sexually dimorphic\n\n2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:39.480\n that there has been a lot of polygyny in human history.\n\n2:54:39.480 --> 2:54:44.480\n And in fact, most of human history was largely polygynous.\n\n2:54:45.120 --> 2:54:48.760\n But it is also the case that most of the people\n\n2:54:48.760 --> 2:54:51.200\n on earth today belong to civilizations\n\n2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:53.040\n that are at least nominally monogamous\n\n2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:54.640\n and have practiced monogamy.\n\n2:54:54.640 --> 2:54:58.040\n And that's not anti evolutionary.\n\n2:54:58.040 --> 2:55:01.360\n What that is is part of what I mentioned before\n\n2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:05.280\n where human beings can swap out their software program\n\n2:55:05.280 --> 2:55:09.880\n and different mating patterns are favored\n\n2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:11.960\n in different periods of history.\n\n2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:15.160\n So I would argue that the benefit of monogamy,\n\n2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:17.360\n the primary one that drives the evolution\n\n2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:19.560\n of monogamous patterns in humans\n\n2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:23.520\n is that it brings all adults into child rearing.\n\n2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:26.640\n Now the reason that that matters\n\n2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:29.880\n is because human babies are very labor intensive.\n\n2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:31.120\n In order to raise them properly,\n\n2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:34.040\n having two parents is a huge asset\n\n2:55:34.040 --> 2:55:35.440\n and having more than two parents,\n\n2:55:35.440 --> 2:55:38.720\n having an extended family also very important.\n\n2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:43.480\n But what that means is that for a population\n\n2:55:43.480 --> 2:55:48.000\n that is expanding, a monogamous mating system makes sense.\n\n2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:50.720\n It makes sense because it means that the number of offspring\n\n2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:52.840\n that can be raised is elevated.\n\n2:55:52.840 --> 2:55:56.280\n It's elevated because all potential parents\n\n2:55:56.280 --> 2:55:58.080\n are involved in parenting.\n\n2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:00.160\n Whereas if you sideline a bunch of males\n\n2:56:00.160 --> 2:56:01.520\n by having a polygynous system\n\n2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:03.240\n in which one male has many females,\n\n2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:05.360\n which is typically the way that works,\n\n2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:07.040\n what you do is you sideline all those males,\n\n2:56:07.040 --> 2:56:09.960\n which means the total amount of parental effort is lower\n\n2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:12.160\n and the population can't grow.\n\n2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:15.680\n So what I'm arguing is that you should expect to see\n\n2:56:16.920 --> 2:56:20.640\n populations that face the possibility of expansion\n\n2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:21.880\n endorse monogamy.\n\n2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:24.000\n And at the point that they have reached carrying capacity,\n\n2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:26.480\n you should expect to see polygyny break back out.\n\n2:56:26.480 --> 2:56:28.120\n And what we are seeing\n\n2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.600\n is a kind of false sophistication around polyamory,\n\n2:56:31.600 --> 2:56:35.080\n which will end up breaking down into polygyny,\n\n2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:37.560\n which will not be in the interest of most people.\n\n2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:38.920\n Really the only people whose interest\n\n2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:41.200\n it could be argued to be in\n\n2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:44.320\n would be the very small number of males at the top\n\n2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:48.960\n who have many partners and everybody else suffers.\n\n2:56:48.960 --> 2:56:51.240\n Is it possible to make the argument\n\n2:56:51.240 --> 2:56:55.040\n if we focus in on those males at the quote unquote top\n\n2:56:55.040 --> 2:56:57.640\n with many female partners,\n\n2:56:57.640 --> 2:57:02.280\n is it possible to say that that's a suboptimal life,\n\n2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:05.240\n that a single partner is the optimal life?\n\n2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:06.320\n Well, it depends what you mean.\n\n2:57:06.320 --> 2:57:09.280\n I have a feeling that you and I wouldn't have to go very far\n\n2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:14.280\n to figure out that what might be evolutionarily optimal\n\n2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:17.280\n doesn't match my values as a person\n\n2:57:17.280 --> 2:57:20.200\n and I'm sure it doesn't match yours either.\n\n2:57:20.200 --> 2:57:23.200\n Can we try to dig into that gap between those two?\n\n2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:24.040\n Sure.\n\n2:57:24.040 --> 2:57:26.880\n I mean, we can do it very simply.\n\n2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:33.200\n Selection might favor your engaging in war\n\n2:57:33.200 --> 2:57:37.520\n against a defenseless enemy or genocide, right?\n\n2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:40.160\n It's not hard to figure out\n\n2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:43.320\n how that might put your genes at advantage.\n\n2:57:43.320 --> 2:57:44.760\n I don't know about you, Lex.\n\n2:57:44.760 --> 2:57:46.800\n I'm not getting involved in no genocide.\n\n2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:47.800\n It's not gonna happen.\n\n2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:48.640\n I won't do it.\n\n2:57:48.640 --> 2:57:49.920\n I will do anything to avoid it.\n\n2:57:49.920 --> 2:57:54.400\n So some part of me has decided that my conscious self\n\n2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:59.400\n and the values that I hold trump my evolutionary self\n\n2:57:59.400 --> 2:58:03.080\n and once you figure out that in some extreme case,\n\n2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:04.920\n that's true and then you realize\n\n2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:07.520\n that that means it must be possible in many other cases\n\n2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:09.120\n and you start going through all of the things\n\n2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:10.200\n that selection would favor\n\n2:58:10.200 --> 2:58:12.360\n and you realize that a fair fraction of the time,\n\n2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:14.000\n actually, you're not up for this.\n\n2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:17.160\n You don't wanna be some robot on a mission\n\n2:58:17.160 --> 2:58:19.960\n that involves genocide when necessary.\n\n2:58:19.960 --> 2:58:22.000\n You wanna be your own person and accomplish things\n\n2:58:22.000 --> 2:58:24.880\n that you think are valuable.\n\n2:58:24.880 --> 2:58:29.880\n And so among those are not advocating,\n\n2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:32.120\n let's suppose you were in a position\n\n2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:35.040\n to be one of those males at the top of a polygynous system.\n\n2:58:35.040 --> 2:58:38.160\n We both know why that would be rewarding, right?\n\n2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:39.560\n But we also both recognize.\n\n2:58:39.560 --> 2:58:40.400\n Do we?\n\n2:58:40.400 --> 2:58:41.440\n Yeah, sure.\n\n2:58:41.440 --> 2:58:42.280\n Lots of sex?\n\n2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:43.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:43.960\n Okay, what else?\n\n2:58:43.960 --> 2:58:45.960\n Lots of sex and lots of variety, right?\n\n2:58:45.960 --> 2:58:50.960\n So look, every red blooded American slash Russian male\n\n2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:53.840\n can understand why that's appealing, right?\n\n2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:57.800\n On the other hand, it is up against an alternative\n\n2:58:57.800 --> 2:59:02.360\n which is having a partner with whom one is bonded\n\n2:59:03.320 --> 2:59:05.400\n especially closely, right?\n\n2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:06.240\n Right.\n\n2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:07.080\n And so.\n\n2:59:07.080 --> 2:59:08.240\n A love.\n\n2:59:08.240 --> 2:59:09.080\n Right.\n\n2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:14.080\n Well, I don't wanna straw man the polygyny position.\n\n2:59:14.080 --> 2:59:15.840\n Obviously polygyny is complex\n\n2:59:15.840 --> 2:59:19.480\n and there's nothing that stops a man presumably\n\n2:59:19.480 --> 2:59:23.520\n from loving multiple partners and from them loving him back.\n\n2:59:23.520 --> 2:59:25.640\n But in terms of, if love is your thing,\n\n2:59:25.640 --> 2:59:28.680\n there's a question about, okay, what is the quality of love\n\n2:59:28.680 --> 2:59:31.760\n if it is divided over multiple partners, right?\n\n2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:36.200\n And what is the net consequence for love in a society\n\n2:59:36.200 --> 2:59:38.720\n when multiple people will be frozen out\n\n2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:41.880\n for every individual male in this case who has it?\n\n2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:46.040\n And what I would argue is, and you know,\n\n2:59:46.040 --> 2:59:47.920\n this is weird to even talk about,\n\n2:59:47.920 --> 2:59:49.680\n but this is partially me just talking\n\n2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:51.120\n from personal experience.\n\n2:59:51.120 --> 2:59:54.040\n I think there actually is a monogamy program in us\n\n2:59:54.040 --> 2:59:55.640\n and it's not automatic.\n\n2:59:55.640 --> 3:00:00.640\n But if you take it seriously, you can find it\n\n3:00:00.680 --> 3:00:04.560\n and frankly, marriage, and it doesn't have to be marriage,\n\n3:00:04.560 --> 3:00:07.440\n but whatever it is that results in a lifelong bond\n\n3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:10.440\n with a partner has gotten a very bad rap.\n\n3:00:10.440 --> 3:00:12.680\n You know, it's the butt of too many jokes.\n\n3:00:12.680 --> 3:00:17.680\n But the truth is, it's hugely rewarding, it's not easy.\n\n3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:20.800\n But if you know that you're looking for something, right?\n\n3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:22.520\n If you know that the objective actually exists\n\n3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:25.360\n and it's not some utopian fantasy that can't be found,\n\n3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:28.600\n if you know that there's some real world, you know,\n\n3:00:28.600 --> 3:00:32.120\n warts and all version of it, then you might actually think,\n\n3:00:32.120 --> 3:00:34.240\n hey, that is something I want and you might pursue it\n\n3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:36.360\n and my guess is you'd be very happy when you find it.\n\n3:00:36.360 --> 3:00:39.440\n Yeah, I think there is, getting to the fundamental\n\n3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:43.240\n and the emergent, I feel like there is some kind of physics\n\n3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:44.080\n of love.\n\n3:00:44.080 --> 3:00:47.200\n So one, there's a conservation thing going on.\n\n3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:51.560\n So if you have like many partners, yeah, in theory,\n\n3:00:51.560 --> 3:00:54.160\n you should be able to love all of them deeply.\n\n3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:56.800\n But it seems like in reality that love gets split.\n\n3:00:57.800 --> 3:00:58.880\n Yep.\n\n3:00:58.880 --> 3:01:01.080\n Now, there's another law that's interesting\n\n3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:02.720\n in terms of monogamy.\n\n3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:04.600\n I don't know if it's at the physics level,\n\n3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:09.600\n but if you are in a monogamous relationship by choice\n\n3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:15.280\n and almost as in slight rebellion to social norms,\n\n3:01:16.520 --> 3:01:17.760\n that's much more powerful.\n\n3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:20.920\n Like if you choose that one partnership,\n\n3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:22.680\n that's also more powerful.\n\n3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:24.880\n If like everybody's in a monogamous,\n\n3:01:24.880 --> 3:01:27.880\n this pressure to be married and this pressure of society,\n\n3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:30.760\n that's different because that's almost like a constraint\n\n3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:33.960\n on your freedom that is enforced by something\n\n3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:35.440\n other than your own ideals.\n\n3:01:35.440 --> 3:01:37.760\n It's by somebody else.\n\n3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:40.600\n When you yourself choose to, I guess,\n\n3:01:40.600 --> 3:01:45.000\n create these constraints, that enriches that love.\n\n3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.560\n So there's some kind of love function,\n\n3:01:47.560 --> 3:01:50.160\n like E equals MC squared, but for love,\n\n3:01:50.160 --> 3:01:53.240\n that I feel like if you have less partners\n\n3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:56.520\n and it's done by choice, that can maximize that.\n\n3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:00.880\n And that love can transcend the biology,\n\n3:02:00.880 --> 3:02:03.520\n transcend the evolutionary biology forces\n\n3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:06.280\n that have to do much more with survival\n\n3:02:06.280 --> 3:02:07.760\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:11.880\n It can transcend to take us to a richer experience,\n\n3:02:11.880 --> 3:02:13.320\n which we have the luxury of having,\n\n3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:17.960\n exploring of happiness, of joy, of fulfillment,\n\n3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:19.400\n all those kinds of things.\n\n3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:21.040\n Totally agree with this.\n\n3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:24.800\n And there's no question that by choice,\n\n3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:26.760\n when there are other choices,\n\n3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:30.760\n imbues it with meaning that it might not otherwise have.\n\n3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:35.640\n I would also say, I'm really struck by,\n\n3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:40.120\n and I have a hard time not feeling terrible sadness\n\n3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:44.360\n over what younger people are coming\n\n3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:46.880\n to think about this topic.\n\n3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:49.520\n I think they're missing something so important\n\n3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:51.680\n and so hard to phrase that,\n\n3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:54.280\n and they don't even know that they're missing it.\n\n3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:55.960\n They might know that they're unhappy,\n\n3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:58.000\n but they don't understand what it is\n\n3:02:58.000 --> 3:02:58.840\n they're even looking for,\n\n3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:00.800\n because nobody's really been honest with them\n\n3:03:00.800 --> 3:03:02.160\n about what their choices are.\n\n3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:05.200\n And I have to say, if I was a young person,\n\n3:03:05.200 --> 3:03:06.960\n or if I was advising a young person,\n\n3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:09.160\n which I used to do, again, a million years ago\n\n3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:12.000\n when I was a college professor four years ago,\n\n3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:13.800\n but I used to talk to students.\n\n3:03:13.800 --> 3:03:15.000\n I knew my students really well,\n\n3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:16.680\n and they would ask questions about this,\n\n3:03:16.680 --> 3:03:17.600\n and they were always curious\n\n3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:19.920\n because Heather and I seemed to have a good relationship,\n\n3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:22.000\n and many of them knew both of us.\n\n3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.480\n So they would talk to us about this.\n\n3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:28.040\n If I was advising somebody, I would say,\n\n3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:30.920\n do not bypass the possibility\n\n3:03:30.920 --> 3:03:35.920\n that what you are supposed to do is find somebody worthy,\n\n3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:37.840\n somebody who can handle it,\n\n3:03:37.840 --> 3:03:39.520\n somebody who you are compatible with,\n\n3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:41.840\n and that you don't have to be perfectly compatible.\n\n3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:44.880\n It's not about dating until you find the one.\n\n3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.600\n It's about finding somebody whose underlying values\n\n3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:51.200\n and viewpoint are complimentary to yours,\n\n3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:53.880\n sufficient that you fall in love.\n\n3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:58.480\n If you find that person, opt out together.\n\n3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:00.400\n Get out of this damn system\n\n3:04:00.400 --> 3:04:02.120\n that's telling you what's sophisticated\n\n3:04:02.120 --> 3:04:04.600\n to think about love and romance and sex.\n\n3:04:04.600 --> 3:04:06.520\n Ignore it together, all right?\n\n3:04:06.520 --> 3:04:11.080\n That's the key, and I believe you'll end up laughing\n\n3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:12.160\n in the end if you do it.\n\n3:04:12.160 --> 3:04:16.000\n You'll discover, wow, that's a hellscape\n\n3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.840\n that I opted out of, and this thing I opted into?\n\n3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:22.640\n Complicated, difficult, worth it.\n\n3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:25.760\n Nothing that's worth it is ever not difficult,\n\n3:04:25.760 --> 3:04:27.480\n so we should even just skip\n\n3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:30.120\n the whole statement about difficult.\n\n3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:30.960\n Yeah, all right.\n\n3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:32.240\n I just, I wanna be honest.\n\n3:04:32.240 --> 3:04:35.080\n It's not like, oh, it's nonstop joy.\n\n3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:38.920\n No, it's fricking complex, but worth it?\n\n3:04:38.920 --> 3:04:41.040\n No question in my mind.\n\n3:04:41.040 --> 3:04:42.920\n Is there advice outside of love\n\n3:04:42.920 --> 3:04:45.320\n that you can give to young people?\n\n3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:47.920\n You were a million years ago a professor.\n\n3:04:49.480 --> 3:04:51.480\n Is there advice you can give to young people,\n\n3:04:51.480 --> 3:04:56.480\n high schoolers, college students about career, about life?\n\n3:04:56.720 --> 3:04:58.800\n Yeah, but it's not, they're not gonna like it\n\n3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:00.840\n because it's not easy to operationalize,\n\n3:05:00.840 --> 3:05:03.080\n and this was a problem when I was a college professor, too.\n\n3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:04.720\n People would ask me what they should do.\n\n3:05:04.720 --> 3:05:06.280\n Should they go to graduate school?\n\n3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:08.280\n I had almost nothing useful to say\n\n3:05:08.280 --> 3:05:13.280\n because the job market and the market of prejob training\n\n3:05:14.200 --> 3:05:19.120\n and all of that, these things are all so distorted\n\n3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:23.440\n and corrupt that I didn't wanna point anybody to anything\n\n3:05:23.440 --> 3:05:26.560\n because it's all broken, and I would tell them that,\n\n3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:31.320\n but I would say that results in a kind of meta level advice\n\n3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:33.400\n that I do think is useful.\n\n3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:34.880\n You don't know what's coming.\n\n3:05:35.840 --> 3:05:38.680\n You don't know where the opportunities will be.\n\n3:05:38.680 --> 3:05:41.640\n You should invest in tools rather than knowledge.\n\n3:05:42.560 --> 3:05:44.440\n To the extent that you can do things,\n\n3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:47.880\n you can repurpose that no matter what the future brings\n\n3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:51.880\n to the extent that if you, as a robot guy,\n\n3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:53.840\n you've got the skills of a robot guy.\n\n3:05:53.840 --> 3:05:56.760\n Now, if civilization failed\n\n3:05:56.760 --> 3:05:59.580\n and the stuff of robot building disappeared with it,\n\n3:06:00.480 --> 3:06:02.560\n you'd still have the mind of a robot guy,\n\n3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:04.480\n and the mind of a robot guy can retool\n\n3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:08.160\n around all kinds of things, whether you're forced to work\n\n3:06:08.160 --> 3:06:12.640\n with fibers that are made into ropes.\n\n3:06:12.640 --> 3:06:15.880\n Your mechanical mind would be useful in all kinds of places,\n\n3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:19.240\n so invest in tools like that that can be easily repurposed,\n\n3:06:19.240 --> 3:06:23.800\n and invest in combinations of tools, right?\n\n3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:27.800\n If civilization keeps limping along,\n\n3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:30.840\n you're gonna be up against all sorts of people\n\n3:06:30.840 --> 3:06:33.360\n who have studied the things that you studied, right?\n\n3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:34.840\n If you think, hey, computer programming\n\n3:06:34.840 --> 3:06:37.720\n is really, really cool, and you pick up computer programming,\n\n3:06:37.720 --> 3:06:40.660\n guess what, you just entered a large group of people\n\n3:06:40.660 --> 3:06:42.540\n who have that skill, and many of them will be better\n\n3:06:42.540 --> 3:06:44.800\n than you, almost certainly.\n\n3:06:44.800 --> 3:06:48.600\n On the other hand, if you combine that with something else\n\n3:06:48.600 --> 3:06:50.800\n that's very rarely combined with it,\n\n3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:54.080\n if you have, I don't know if it's carpentry\n\n3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:57.120\n and computer programming, if you take combinations\n\n3:06:57.120 --> 3:07:00.560\n of things that are, even if they're both common,\n\n3:07:00.560 --> 3:07:03.040\n but they're not commonly found together,\n\n3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:06.080\n then those combinations create a rarefied space\n\n3:07:06.080 --> 3:07:08.360\n where you inhabit it, and even if the things\n\n3:07:08.360 --> 3:07:11.080\n don't even really touch, but nonetheless,\n\n3:07:11.080 --> 3:07:13.760\n they create a mind in which the two things are live\n\n3:07:13.760 --> 3:07:15.920\n and you can move back and forth between them\n\n3:07:15.920 --> 3:07:18.360\n and step out of your own perspective\n\n3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:20.400\n by moving from one to the other,\n\n3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:22.640\n that will increase what you can see\n\n3:07:22.640 --> 3:07:24.480\n and the quality of your tools.\n\n3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:26.440\n And so anyway, that isn't useful advice.\n\n3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:27.520\n It doesn't tell you whether you should go\n\n3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:30.840\n to graduate school or not, but it does tell you\n\n3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:33.600\n the one thing we can say for certain about the future\n\n3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:36.080\n is that it's uncertain, and so prepare for it.\n\n3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:38.800\n And like you said, there's cool things to be discovered\n\n3:07:38.800 --> 3:07:42.400\n in the intersection of fields and ideas.\n\n3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:44.960\n And I would look at grad school that way,\n\n3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:49.960\n actually, if you do go, or I see,\n\n3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.720\n I mean, this is such a, like every course\n\n3:07:52.720 --> 3:07:55.160\n in grad school, undergrad too,\n\n3:07:55.160 --> 3:07:57.800\n was like this little journey that you're on\n\n3:07:57.800 --> 3:08:00.040\n that explores a particular field.\n\n3:08:00.040 --> 3:08:03.760\n And it's not immediately obvious how useful it is,\n\n3:08:03.760 --> 3:08:08.360\n but it allows you to discover intersections\n\n3:08:08.360 --> 3:08:11.120\n between that thing and some other thing.\n\n3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:16.120\n So you're bringing to the table these pieces of knowledge,\n\n3:08:16.400 --> 3:08:19.880\n some of which when intersected might create a niche\n\n3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:23.560\n that's completely novel, unique, and will bring you joy.\n\n3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:25.760\n I mean, I took a huge number of courses\n\n3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:28.040\n in theoretical computer science.\n\n3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:31.000\n Most of them seem useless, but they totally changed\n\n3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:34.760\n the way I see the world in ways that I'm not prepared\n\n3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:38.640\n or is a little bit difficult to kind of make explicit,\n\n3:08:38.640 --> 3:08:43.640\n but taken together, they've allowed me to see,\n\n3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:48.200\n for example, the world of robotics totally different\n\n3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:50.400\n and different from many of my colleagues\n\n3:08:50.400 --> 3:08:51.920\n and friends and so on.\n\n3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:54.600\n And I think that's a good way to see if you go\n\n3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:59.160\n to grad school was as a opportunity\n\n3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:01.920\n to explore intersections of fields,\n\n3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:04.720\n even if the individual fields seem useless.\n\n3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:07.120\n Yeah, and useless doesn't mean useless, right?\n\n3:09:07.120 --> 3:09:09.280\n Useless means not directly applicable,\n\n3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:12.160\n but a good, useless course can be the best one\n\n3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:13.000\n you ever took.\n\n3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:18.080\n Yeah, I took James Joyce, a course on James Joyce,\n\n3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:20.320\n and that was truly useless.\n\n3:09:21.240 --> 3:09:25.880\n Well, I took immunobiology in the medical school\n\n3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:29.640\n when I was at Penn as, I guess I would have been\n\n3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:30.880\n a freshman or a sophomore.\n\n3:09:30.880 --> 3:09:33.040\n I wasn't supposed to be in this class.\n\n3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:37.080\n It blew my goddamn mind, and it still does, right?\n\n3:09:37.080 --> 3:09:39.600\n I mean, we had this, I don't even know who it was,\n\n3:09:39.600 --> 3:09:42.720\n but we had this great professor who was highly placed\n\n3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:44.320\n in the world of immunobiology.\n\n3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:47.640\n The course is called Immunobiology, not immunology.\n\n3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:50.160\n Immunobiology, it had the right focus,\n\n3:09:50.160 --> 3:09:54.560\n and as I recall it, the professor stood sideways\n\n3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:57.240\n to the chalkboard, staring off into space,\n\n3:09:57.240 --> 3:10:01.240\n literally stroking his beard with this bemused look\n\n3:10:01.240 --> 3:10:04.280\n on his face through the entire lecture.\n\n3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:05.800\n And you had all these medical students\n\n3:10:05.800 --> 3:10:07.200\n who were so furiously writing notes\n\n3:10:07.200 --> 3:10:08.600\n that I don't even think they were noticing\n\n3:10:08.600 --> 3:10:09.920\n the person delivering this thing,\n\n3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:13.640\n but I got what this guy was smiling about.\n\n3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:16.040\n It was like so, what he was describing,\n\n3:10:16.040 --> 3:10:18.720\n adaptive immunity is so marvelous, right?\n\n3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:21.420\n That it was like almost a privilege to even be saying it\n\n3:10:21.420 --> 3:10:23.960\n to a room full of people who were listening, you know?\n\n3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:25.360\n But anyway, yeah, I took that course,\n\n3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:27.360\n and lo and behold, COVID.\n\n3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:28.920\n That's gonna be useful.\n\n3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:32.160\n Well, yeah, suddenly it's front and center,\n\n3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:33.640\n and wow, am I glad I took it.\n\n3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:37.080\n But anyway, yeah, useless courses are great.\n\n3:10:37.080 --> 3:10:40.240\n And actually, Eric gave me one of the greater pieces\n\n3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:43.420\n of advice, at least for college, that anyone's ever given,\n\n3:10:43.420 --> 3:10:46.160\n which was don't worry about the prereqs.\n\n3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:47.640\n Take it anyway, right?\n\n3:10:48.560 --> 3:10:50.440\n But now, I don't even know if kids can do this now\n\n3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:53.280\n because the prereqs are now enforced by a computer.\n\n3:10:53.280 --> 3:10:56.800\n But back in the day, if you didn't mention\n\n3:10:56.800 --> 3:10:58.020\n that you didn't have the prereqs,\n\n3:10:58.020 --> 3:10:59.720\n nobody stopped you from taking the course.\n\n3:10:59.720 --> 3:11:01.440\n And what he told me, which I didn't know,\n\n3:11:01.440 --> 3:11:06.360\n was that often the advanced courses are easier in some way.\n\n3:11:06.360 --> 3:11:11.360\n The material's complex, but it's not like intro bio\n\n3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:14.480\n where you're learning a thousand things at once, right?\n\n3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:16.040\n It's like focused on something.\n\n3:11:16.040 --> 3:11:18.800\n So if you dedicate yourself, you can pull it off.\n\n3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:21.520\n Yeah, stay with an idea for many weeks at a time,\n\n3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:22.880\n and it's ultimately rewarding,\n\n3:11:22.880 --> 3:11:24.600\n and not as difficult as it looks.\n\n3:11:25.760 --> 3:11:27.280\n Can I ask you a ridiculous question?\n\n3:11:27.280 --> 3:11:28.100\n Please.\n\n3:11:28.100 --> 3:11:31.520\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n3:11:34.180 --> 3:11:38.860\n Well, I feel terrible having to give you the answer.\n\n3:11:38.860 --> 3:11:40.260\n I realize you asked the question,\n\n3:11:40.260 --> 3:11:43.260\n but if I tell you, you're gonna again feel bad.\n\n3:11:43.260 --> 3:11:44.100\n I don't wanna do that.\n\n3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:46.060\n But look, there's two.\n\n3:11:46.060 --> 3:11:47.300\n There can be a disappointment.\n\n3:11:47.300 --> 3:11:50.340\n No, it's gonna be a horror, right?\n\n3:11:50.340 --> 3:11:52.660\n Because we actually know the answer to the question.\n\n3:11:52.660 --> 3:11:53.820\n Oh no.\n\n3:11:53.820 --> 3:11:56.180\n It's completely meaningless.\n\n3:11:56.180 --> 3:11:58.460\n There is nothing that we can do\n\n3:11:58.460 --> 3:12:00.780\n that escapes the heat death of the universe\n\n3:12:00.780 --> 3:12:02.740\n or whatever it is that happens at the end.\n\n3:12:02.740 --> 3:12:04.780\n And we're not gonna make it there anyway.\n\n3:12:04.780 --> 3:12:07.700\n But even if you were optimistic about our ability\n\n3:12:07.700 --> 3:12:12.700\n to escape every existential hazard indefinitely,\n\n3:12:13.300 --> 3:12:15.900\n ultimately it's all for naught and we know it, right?\n\n3:12:17.060 --> 3:12:20.660\n That said, once you stare into that abyss,\n\n3:12:20.660 --> 3:12:24.420\n and then it stares back and laughs or whatever happens,\n\n3:12:24.420 --> 3:12:27.140\n then the question is, okay, given that,\n\n3:12:27.140 --> 3:12:29.740\n can I relax a little bit, right?\n\n3:12:29.740 --> 3:12:31.880\n And figure out, well, what would make sense\n\n3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:34.380\n if that were true, right?\n\n3:12:34.380 --> 3:12:37.220\n And I think there's something very clear to me.\n\n3:12:37.220 --> 3:12:38.980\n I think if you do all of the,\n\n3:12:38.980 --> 3:12:41.780\n if I just take the values that I'm sure we share\n\n3:12:41.780 --> 3:12:43.900\n and extrapolate from them,\n\n3:12:43.900 --> 3:12:46.900\n I think the following thing is actually a moral imperative.\n\n3:12:48.460 --> 3:12:51.600\n Being a human and having opportunity\n\n3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:54.340\n is absolutely fucking awesome, right?\n\n3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:56.020\n A lot of people don't make use of the opportunity\n\n3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:58.040\n and a lot of people don't have opportunity, right?\n\n3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:00.140\n They get to be human, but they're too constrained\n\n3:13:00.140 --> 3:13:03.880\n by keeping a roof over their heads to really be free.\n\n3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:07.460\n But being a free human is fantastic.\n\n3:13:07.460 --> 3:13:10.100\n And being a free human on this beautiful planet,\n\n3:13:10.100 --> 3:13:13.860\n crippled as it may be, is unparalleled.\n\n3:13:13.860 --> 3:13:15.300\n I mean, what could be better?\n\n3:13:15.300 --> 3:13:17.820\n How lucky are we that we get that, right?\n\n3:13:17.820 --> 3:13:21.380\n So if that's true, that it is awesome to be human\n\n3:13:21.380 --> 3:13:25.300\n and to be free, then surely it is our obligation\n\n3:13:25.300 --> 3:13:28.220\n to deliver that opportunity to as many people as we can.\n\n3:13:29.060 --> 3:13:30.760\n And how do you do that?\n\n3:13:30.760 --> 3:13:33.340\n Well, I think I know what job one is.\n\n3:13:33.340 --> 3:13:36.820\n Job one is we have to get sustainable.\n\n3:13:36.820 --> 3:13:39.060\n The way to get the maximum number of humans\n\n3:13:39.060 --> 3:13:42.720\n to have that opportunity to be both here and free\n\n3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:44.900\n is to make sure that there isn't a limit\n\n3:13:44.900 --> 3:13:46.780\n on how long we can keep doing this.\n\n3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:50.400\n That effectively requires us to reach sustainability.\n\n3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:54.340\n And then at sustainability, you could have a horror show\n\n3:13:54.340 --> 3:13:55.500\n of sustainability, right?\n\n3:13:55.500 --> 3:13:58.860\n You could have a totalitarian sustainability.\n\n3:13:58.860 --> 3:14:00.220\n That's not the objective.\n\n3:14:00.220 --> 3:14:02.140\n The objective is to liberate people.\n\n3:14:02.140 --> 3:14:04.980\n And so the question, the whole fourth frontier question,\n\n3:14:04.980 --> 3:14:08.380\n frankly, is how do you get to a sustainable\n\n3:14:08.380 --> 3:14:10.780\n and indefinitely sustainable state\n\n3:14:10.780 --> 3:14:13.060\n in which people feel liberated,\n\n3:14:13.060 --> 3:14:14.500\n in which they are liberated,\n\n3:14:14.500 --> 3:14:16.300\n to pursue the things that actually matter,\n\n3:14:16.300 --> 3:14:21.300\n to pursue beauty, truth, compassion, connection,\n\n3:14:22.940 --> 3:14:27.220\n all of those things that we could list as unalloyed goods,\n\n3:14:27.220 --> 3:14:29.420\n those are the things that people should be most liberated\n\n3:14:29.420 --> 3:14:31.660\n to do in a system that really functions.\n\n3:14:31.660 --> 3:14:33.880\n And anyway, my point is,\n\n3:14:35.020 --> 3:14:37.020\n I don't know how precise that calculation is,\n\n3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:38.580\n but I'm pretty sure it's not wrong.\n\n3:14:38.580 --> 3:14:39.940\n It's accurate enough.\n\n3:14:39.940 --> 3:14:43.460\n And if it is accurate enough, then the point is, okay,\n\n3:14:43.460 --> 3:14:45.300\n well, there's no ultimate meaning,\n\n3:14:45.300 --> 3:14:47.100\n but the proximate meaning is that one.\n\n3:14:47.100 --> 3:14:50.160\n How many people can we get to have this wonderful experience\n\n3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:52.220\n that we've gotten to have, right?\n\n3:14:52.220 --> 3:14:54.760\n And there's no way that's so wrong\n\n3:14:54.760 --> 3:14:56.640\n that if I invest my life in it,\n\n3:14:56.640 --> 3:14:58.260\n that I'm making some big error.\n\n3:14:58.260 --> 3:14:59.180\n I'm sure of that.\n\n3:14:59.180 --> 3:15:02.300\n Life is awesome, and we wanna spread the awesome\n\n3:15:02.300 --> 3:15:03.520\n as much as possible.\n\n3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:05.740\n Yeah, you sum it up that way, spread the awesome.\n\n3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:06.680\n Spread the awesome.\n\n3:15:06.680 --> 3:15:07.940\n So that's the fourth frontier.\n\n3:15:07.940 --> 3:15:10.560\n And if that fails, if the fourth frontier fails,\n\n3:15:10.560 --> 3:15:12.980\n the fifth frontier will be defined by robots,\n\n3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:15.420\n and hopefully they'll learn the lessons\n\n3:15:15.420 --> 3:15:18.380\n of the mistakes that the humans made\n\n3:15:18.380 --> 3:15:20.380\n and build a better world with more awesome.\n\n3:15:20.380 --> 3:15:21.220\n I hope they're very happy here\n\n3:15:21.220 --> 3:15:23.540\n and that they do a better job with the place than we did.\n\n3:15:23.540 --> 3:15:24.380\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:25.220 --> 3:15:26.060\n Brett.\n\n3:15:26.060 --> 3:15:29.020\n I can't believe it took us this long to talk,\n\n3:15:29.020 --> 3:15:31.620\n as I mentioned to you before,\n\n3:15:31.620 --> 3:15:35.780\n that we haven't actually spoken, I think, at all.\n\n3:15:35.780 --> 3:15:39.320\n And I've always felt that we're already friends.\n\n3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:40.700\n I don't know how that works\n\n3:15:40.700 --> 3:15:42.940\n because I've listened to your podcasts a lot.\n\n3:15:42.940 --> 3:15:46.060\n I've also sort of loved your brother.\n\n3:15:46.060 --> 3:15:48.140\n And so it was like,\n\n3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:49.940\n we've known each other for the longest time,\n\n3:15:49.940 --> 3:15:53.940\n and I hope we can be friends and talk often again.\n\n3:15:53.940 --> 3:15:56.260\n And I hope that you get a chance to meet\n\n3:15:56.260 --> 3:15:59.020\n some of my robot friends as well and fall in love.\n\n3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:02.620\n And I'm so glad that you love robots as well.\n\n3:16:02.620 --> 3:16:04.060\n So we get to share in that love.\n\n3:16:04.060 --> 3:16:07.620\n So I can't wait for us to interact together.\n\n3:16:07.620 --> 3:16:11.680\n So we went from talking about some of the worst failures\n\n3:16:11.680 --> 3:16:14.620\n of humanity to some of the most beautiful\n\n3:16:14.620 --> 3:16:16.380\n aspects of humanity.\n\n3:16:16.380 --> 3:16:18.840\n What else can you ask for from a conversation?\n\n3:16:18.840 --> 3:16:20.580\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n3:16:20.580 --> 3:16:23.140\n You know, Lex, I feel the same way towards you,\n\n3:16:23.140 --> 3:16:24.280\n and I really appreciate it.\n\n3:16:24.280 --> 3:16:25.260\n This has been a lot of fun,\n\n3:16:25.260 --> 3:16:27.860\n and I'm looking forward to our next one.\n\n3:16:27.860 --> 3:16:29.260\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:16:29.260 --> 3:16:30.340\n with Brett Weinstein,\n\n3:16:30.340 --> 3:16:32.820\n and thank you to Jordan Harbridge's show,\n\n3:16:32.820 --> 3:16:36.500\n Express CPN, Magic Spoon, and Four Sigmatic.\n\n3:16:36.500 --> 3:16:39.820\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n3:16:39.820 --> 3:16:41.820\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n3:16:41.820 --> 3:16:43.680\n from Charles Darwin.\n\n3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:46.540\n Ignorance more frequently begets confidence\n\n3:16:46.540 --> 3:16:47.880\n than does knowledge.\n\n3:16:47.880 --> 3:16:51.540\n It is those who know little, not those who know much,\n\n3:16:51.540 --> 3:16:55.140\n who so positively assert that this or that problem\n\n3:16:55.140 --> 3:16:57.720\n will never be solved by science.\n\n3:16:57.720 --> 3:17:09.720\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
